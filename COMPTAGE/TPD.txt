YOUNG DUNCAN	Hey, little brother.

YOUNG JACOB	Hey, big brother.

YOUNG DUNCAN	You scared?

YOUNG JACOB	[SHAKES HEAD NO]  Uh uh.

YOUNG DUNCAN	Well, if you ever get scared, just remember I'll always be right here.

YOUNG JACOB	[NODS]

YOUNG DUNCAN	I have an idea.  Come here.  Put this on.  As long as you have this on, you'll be safe because I'll be with you.  Just like big brother magic.  Shh, shh, shh.

VERNON	They're here.

YOUNG DUNCAN 	What is it?

VERNON	Here.  Now you boys remember what I taught you.  I need you to look after your brother.

YOUNG DUNCAN	Yes, sir.

VERNON	Put your boots on.  You wait for my signal, okay?  Go.

YOUNG JACOB	Mom?

MOM	Duncan.  Jacob.  I love you.

YOUNG DUNCAN	Come on.  Stay.  Shh.  When I say go, you run.  You don't look up.  You don't stop runnin'.

YOUNG JACOB	No.

YOUNG DUNCAN	It's just like Pa taught us, okay?

YOUNG JACOB	No.  Okay. 

YOUNG DUNCAN	Now.

GUNMAN 1	[I hear that.  Blank round, blank round, go?]

YOUNG JACOB 	I thought they got you.

YOUNG DUNCAN	I know.  Shh.

LESTER	Time to go.  Boys!   Now!

YOUNG DUNCAN	Come on.

LESTER	Come on.  Yeah.  Come on.

YOUNG JACOB	Momma!  Mom.  Mom.

LESTER	No, no, no, no.  We can't do this.

YOUNG JACOB	[MOUTHING "MOM"]

LESTER	[MOUTHING "COME ON"]

LESTER	[MOUTHING "COME ON"]

EARL	God damnit!

JACOB	Apologies, I…

EARL	You got a death wish, boy?  'Cause it's about to come true.

JACOB	I'm sorry, sir, it was an accident.

BARTENDER	Hey, hey, hey, c-come on now, Earl.  We don't want no trouble.  Earl!

EARL	Are you tryna tell me this little pissant's a Dalton?  You don't look like no Dalton.

DUNCAN	How 'bout you tell me what you think a Dalton looks like then?

EARL	Hey, friend, now we were just funnin', just havin' a little playin' with the kid. That's all.

DUNCAN	Mm-hmm.  You wanna keep playing, we can keep playin'.

EARL	Naw.  All good here.  Come on.

DODD	You boys have yourselves a daisy of a day.

DUNCAN	Hey, little brother.

JACOB	Hey, big brother.

DUNCAN	You all right?  

JACOB	[NODS]

DUNCAN	Of course you are.

JACOB	I haven't seen you in a while.

DUNCAN	Mmm?  You know, me and the gang been havin' some fun.  Why don't you come have a drink with us?

JACOB	I-I-I got a job to finish.

DUNCAN	Well, I'm sure that can wait, can't it?  Hmm?

BARTENDER	Yeah.

DUNCAN	In fact, it's break time.

TRUMAN	Come on.

WYLIE	Maybe.  What about… No, you're right.  You're right.

BARTENDER	I'ma bake some more of that fire bread y'all like.  A little going away treat.

JACOB	What, you're leaving already?

DUNCAN	Well, some folks aren't too happy with the fun that we've been havin'.  So, me and the gang, we're gonna lay low for a while.  Hey.  Come on.  I always come back. Sit down.  Come on, have a drink.  Sit next to the big man.  He just got a fresh bear kill.

TRUMAN	With his, uh, bare hands.

JACOB	I'm okay.  I'll just stand.

BRENDA	New posters?

BARTENDER	[Sheriff Trussell?]  bought 'em in last month.  Cupped the bounty.

TRUMAN	Well, 'bout to go up.

TRUMAN	Aw, a thousand dollars.  C-… Will you please tell those fine men at the printing press that my head is worth at least, uh, well, at least double that?

BRENDA	No worry.  You'll catch up.  [LAUGH]

TRUMAN	Shit.  Oh!  I did not spill a drop. 
 
BRENDA	How much you squirrelin' away, stud?

JACOB	Oh, uh, I mean, I got a little money.  But I'm not…

DODD	Well, good.  I'll deal you in.

JACOB	I can't.  I'm-I'm saving it.

DUNCAN	I'll play his hand.

DODD	Saving enough for the family farm, huh?

DUNCAN	Past is the past.  Let's leave it that way.

TRUMAN	You gotta work here for what, ten years?  Save up to buy that old place.

JACOB	Eight years, eleven months, seven days.

BRENDA	Damn.  Down to the day.

JACOB	Hey, you should really see it.  T-I mean, they fixed it all up.  I-It looks just like when we were…

DUNCAN	You been going back out there?

LESTER	Duncan, it's Buck.

WYLIE	God damnit, Buck, you get out of that street and stop playing with this man.

BUCK	Not today, Wylie.

OUTLAW	Draw.  I got him!  I got that sum' bitch.  Yee! [LAUGH]

DUNCAN	I thought they told you to stop messin' with that bounty man.

BUCK	That, they did.

DUNCAN	You gonna listen next time?

BUCK	Next time.

DODD	I'm callin' his peacemaker.  Well, shit.  It's either me or the undertaker.  Rest in peace, brother.  I'll see you there soon.

LESTER	Damn you, Buck.

BRENDA	Now we're one short tomorrow.

DUNCAN	Yeah, I know.  We're gonna have to call it off.

DODD	Might get one of them Burns boys.

DUNCAN	No, I don't know about that.

DODD	Let's do it.  They're stone cold killers.

BRENDA	Yeah, that's not the best idea.

WYLIE	Brenda, you didn't?

BRENDA	I most certainly did.  Both of 'em, at the same time.  [LAUGH]

WYLIE	Nevertheless, why does that disqualify them from this then?

BRENDA	Well, it doesn't for me, personally.  I mean, double the trouble is double my pleasure.  I'm just simply answering your question, is all.  But do bear in mind that after that, I'm robbin' both blind.  [LAUGH]

DODD	[LAUGH]

JACOB	I'll do it.

DUNCAN	You'll do what?

JACOB	I'll help.

WYLIE	That could help.

DUNCAN	The hell it could.

JACOB	You seen them pelts in there.  I shot those.  I'm gettin' damn good too.

DUNCAN	Yeah, you are.  And you're earning yourself an honest living.  There's no reason to leave that.

JACOB	Well, you don't get to tell me what to do anymore.

DUNCAN	You sure about that, boy?

JACOB	Look, Duncan, I-I mean, I-I appreciate everything you've done for me.  You know I do.  But I'm ready to do more.  You know, maybe my cut will be enough to buy back dad's farm.

DUNCAN	Forget about Vernon.  Forget about that damn farm.

JACOB	Stop callin' him Vernon.  He was your daddy too.  Hey.  Let me do this.  Lester?

LESTER	[SIGH]  They'll figure it out.

TRUMAN	Hey, hey, what do y'all think?  Huh?  [DANCING]

DODD	You look like shit.

TRUMAN	Son of a…

WYLIE	Hear me out.  We both know we got a good team here.

DUNCAN	Mm-hmm.

WYLIE	And this one promises to be a very big score.

DUNCAN	Well then we do it without him.

WYLIE	Look.  Just a half day past Cordoba Canyon.  There's an impasse that they'll be crossin' just before daylight.  No one out that way for miles.  Now, we make our positions down the tree line on the east and west banks, and we'll be in and outta there in a flash.  Hell, we've been down far more difficult roads before.

DUNCAN	Well, I ain't puttin' him in the middle of a fire fight.

WYLIE	And I ain't askin' for that.  Maybe we move Brenda to Buck's spot, crowd control. Then Jake steps in as horse wrangler, helps us beat a hasty retreat, and never  even makes it past the tree line.

DUNCAN	And if things go south?

WYLIE	Then it wasn't what the good Lord wanted.  And we move onto the next.  Have I ever been wrong?

DUNCAN	[LAUGH]  Yes, you have.  Several times.

WYLIE	Well, you and me, we've been through some shit though, right?

DUNCAN	We have.

WYLIE	And here we are.  Still kicking.

DUNCAN	Mm-hmm.

WYLIE	So you trust me?

DUNCAN	Of course I trust you.  It's never been about that.  Just, kid's the only family I got.  And I didn't have a choice.

WYLIE	I get it.  I do.  But Jake, he's old enough to be makin' his own decisions.  And just like his brother, he could be pretty damn stubborn.

DUNCAN	No.  No.  Stubborn or not, it's still my call.

WYLIE	Thanks for proving my point.  [LAUGH]

ALLAN 	[NODS]

OUTLAW 1	[NODS]

BRENDA	Howdy.  Name's Brenda Birdy Younger, at your service.  Y'all stay calm.  Y'all stay breathin'.  Hey, give mama a little drink, why don't you?  Come on.  Huh?  Mmm.  I'm more of a bourbon girl myself.  Anybody got [thistledoo?]?  Oh, hi.  Hey, mom.  [LAUGH]  That's gotta hurt.  [LAUGH]

DODD	The fuck is this?  Where's the goddamn [safe?]?  

FEMALE 1	[GASP]

ALLAN	[GASPING FOR AIR] [LAUGH]

DODD 	[MAKES SOUND] Just where you crawlin' off to?

ALLAN	Um, you know.

DODD	I don't know. [KICKS ALLAN]

JACOB	You're injured.

DODD	Mmm.  

ALLAN	[COUGHING]

DODD	That's an awful lot of pinks for one goddamn box.  Who you movin'?  Who the buyer?

ALLAN	I don't know shit.

DODD	You sure about that?  Hmm?  [Call it off?] or I feel like you might know something.

ALLAN	I know you are fucked.

DODD	[LAUGH]  Oh, shit.

JACOB	You should go.  Just go.  Go!

DODD	Open.  Wider.  Now, last chance.

ALLAN	You go to hell. [GRUNTS]
 
DODD	Thought you might say that.  You're already there now.

ALLAN	No.  No.  [SCREAMS]

DUNCAN	Jake.  The hell you doin' out here?  Let's go.  Let's go!

LESTER	Let me do that.

DODD	Well, who are you?

PEARL	My name is Pearl.

LESTER	Glad to know you, Pearl.  Why they leave you shackled up like that?

PEARL	I'm afraid I don't know.  Um, these men just took me from my home in Potemkin.

LESTER	Potemkin?

DODD	What are you worth?

PEARL	Worth?  I don't know, sir.  Uh, I don't really know much of anything that's going on.

DODD	Geez, nobody knows nothin'.  Got it.

JACOB	Wait.

DODD	You got something to say?

JACOB	We can't just…

DODD	Hey, look, kid.  People don't put people in boxes 'cause they expect them to behave themself, okay?  I don't know her story and I don't give a shit.  All we're gonna do is move her from here to there, collect that money, all right?

JACOB	Wait, seriously?  We're still doin' this?  She's just an innocent woman.

DUNCAN	Wylie, help me understand what's happening here.

WYLIE	I don't know.  Well, some extra security on it, but to be frank, I expected a little more gold and a little less girl.

DODD	Goddamn.

LESTER	Who's the buyer?

WYLIE	I don't know him.  Uh, some middleman with a… [I think, would be my odd guess?].  Mather, Cotton Mather the fourth.  [INAUDIBLE]
 
WYLIE	He was bein' real secretive about the whole thing.

JACOB	We can't do this, right?

DUNCAN	Now, we ain't gonna sell her to nobody.  That ain't what we do.

DODD	What about the fuckin' outlaws?  What are you talkin' about?

DUNCAN	You know what I mean, Dodd.

BRENDA	Well, there goes our big payday.

PEARL	If you take me to my home, there would be a handsome reward.

WYLIE	The f-…

DUNCAN	You all right?

JACOB	Huh?

DUNCAN	You get hit?

JACOB	No.  No.

DUNCAN	Oh, shit.

JACOB	Duncan.

DODD	Jesus.

DODD	Jesus.  Jesus.

JACOB	Duncan.  Duncan.  Can you hear me?

DUNCAN	No, I know.  I'm-I'm okay.  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  I'm okay.

JACOB	Duncan?

DUNCAN	I'm okay.  I'm okay.  [WINCING IN PAIN]  She got me.

JACOB	Hey, hey.  

DUNCAN	I'm good.  I'm good. 

JACOB	Can you hear me?

DODD	Okay, come on.  Come here.

WYLIE	Help him up.  Help him up.  Help him up.

JACOB	Duncan.

DUNCAN	Wait, wait.  [WINCING IN PAIN]

BRENDA	Jesus.

DUNCAN	Okay.  I'm all right.  Get my hat.  Where's my hat?

JACOB	Thanks, Lester.

DODD 	Yeah. 

DUNCAN	[WINCING IN PAIN]  All right.  Get me my horse.  Give me my horse.

DODD 	Okay.  Come on.

JACOB	All right.

DUNCAN	[WINCING IN PAIN]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.

DODD	I got him.

WYLIE	Oh god.

DODD	Oh gosh.

DUNCAN	Come on, chief, come on.  Aw, goddamn.

WYLIE	Okay, it's okay.

DUNCAN	Goddamn it, chief.  [WINCING IN PAIN]

DODD	I got it.  Got it.

DUNCAN	Wrap it tight.  Come on, make it tight!  Aw.  All right, that's good.  That's good.  Come on.

DODD	Okay.  All right.

DUNCAN	[That ain't worth this though, do you?]

DODD	Oh hell no.

DUNCAN	Come on.

DODD	A bit more this way.

DUNCAN	Get.  

WYLIE	Dodd.

DUNCAN	Get outta here.  Go on.  I got it.  I got it.

JACOB	What can I do?

DUNCAN	You can go to your horse.  Go to your horse.

JACOB	Hey.

DUNCAN	Come on.  Come here, little brother.  Come here.  It's just a graze.  Yeah, she just grazed me.

JACOB	I know she did.  Brother magic, all right?

DUNCAN	Yeah.  I'ma be all right.

JACOB	I know.

DUNCAN	Damn it.  I got it, boy.  We could go.  Come on.

LESTER	How long?  Ah.  Shit.  Macon's too far.  Hey.  You got any doctors in that town of yours?

PEARL	Yes.

WYLIE	Let's hold up here.  Get him off his horse and rested for a bit.

DODD	Okay, lady, you heard the man.  This is your stop.

JACOB	Her name is Pearl.

DODD	See, kid, that's the problem.  Your name 'em, you start to get attached.

WYLIE	Which way to the doctor?

PEARL	I can take you.

DODD	No, that ain't gonna be the way this works.

WYLIE	Dodd's right.  You point in the direction of the doc, we go get him.

PEARL 	[POINTS]

WYLIE	Truman, chief, go check the town and get the doc.  Hell, find anyone who can help.

LESTER	I'm gon' take him back here.

JACOB	Hey.  Help is on the way, okay?  I'm sorry, Duncan.

JACOB	It's all my fault.  [CRYING]  I…

DUNCAN	Don't.

JACOB	No, you don't understand.  I-I saw her.  She was right there.  I saw her.  And I…

DUNCAN	I know.

JACOB	You know?

DUNCAN	I know.

JACOB	I… I-I just-I couldn't.  I couldn't pull the trigger.

DUNCAN	I'm glad you couldn't do it.  I'm glad you couldn't do it.

WYLIE	How's he doin'?

JACOB	He lost a lot of blood.  He wants to see you.

DUNCAN	[COUGHING]  Hell of a situation we got going here.

WYLIE	Don't talk.  Keep your energy.

DUNCAN	Wylie, you-you've always been-you always been a good number two.  And I trust you with my life.  Until we get out of this, Lester is in charge, you hear me?  [COUGHING]  And you-you do me a favor.  You take care of my brother, okay?

LESTER	On my life.

WYLIE	Mine too.

JACOB	Is this necessary?

DODD	It's necessary.

JACOB	Oh, come on, man.

DODD	Green horn here seemed to forget that a bunch of armed pinkertons found it necessary to shackle his new friend and lock her in a box.

JACOB	Maybe she didn't do nothin' wrong.

DODD	Or maybe this is all a trap.  And I ain't about to let what happen to your brother happen in vain, you understand?

TRUMAN	Ain't nothin' out there but more woods.  

DODD	Fuck this.

TRUMAN	So what, so this building, this-this is your town?

PEARL	I offered to take you.

DODD	She obviously can't be trusted.  Keep an eye on her.  I'm gonna take a look around.  God damnit.

WYLIE	Where have you brought us?  Brenda?   Ride hard to this outpost and get a doctor or medical supplies or whatever and get back here, fast.  The fuck, man?  You should be more careful.

DODD	That was close.

WYLIE	You know, you could be nicer.

DODD	Oh, you mean like, in general?

WYLIE	I think you know what I mean.

DODD	Yeah.  But I know that you know that this is all fucked, you know?  Yeah.

WYLIE	Say, man, you got another one of those?

DODD	Yeah, sure, hold on.  For one of them little jerkies that I know you got stashed somewhere.

WYLIE	Oh, shit, man.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, sure.  Help yourself.

DODD	Mmm.  Oh.
 
FEMALE VOICE	[Oh, damn?]  

DODD	I knew it!  I fucking knew it.  Where is she?  Where is the goddamn girl?

JACOB	The hell?

TRUMAN	She was right there!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!

JACOB	What are you doing?

DODD	You helped her.

JACOB	What?  

WYLIE	Now look.  We can all trust each other here.

DODD	Can we?

JACOB	Uh huh.

DODD	Bullshit.  I should just put a bullet right through your fucking head.

LESTER	I think you should back the fuck off.  That's what I think you should do.

DODD	All right!  I see you're still playing the dead daddy role now, is that it?

PEARL	Mother is waitin' for you.

DODD	How did you get loose?

TRUMAN	Did you just say "mother?"

PEARL	Your friend is dying.  Do you want help or not?

JACOB	Yes.

PEARL	The help is this way, to the brothel.

DODD	Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?  Oh, now we're just gonna follow her now?

TRUMAN	She did say brothel.

DODD	How much further?

PEARL	Not far.  Town square is just ahead.  This way.

WYLIE	Well, they're not here, huh, Truman?

TRUMAN	None of this was here, I swear.

MARIA	Are you enjoying your brazen?

PEARL	It's the best.

MARIA	Where are my manners?

PEARL	This is Duncan.  He's been injured.

MARIA	On your daring rescue?

DODD	Uh, yes, ma'am, it was quite an ordeal.

MARIA	Help this man.  Gentleman, please, make yourselves at home.  Let's get a bed ready for this nice man.

DODD	Oh, and I understand there was a reward involved?

MARIA	Of course.  A handsome sum for these handsome men.  You boys enjoy yourselves while we take care of your friend.

DODD	Oh, wait, um, good luck gettin' him to talk.

DUNCAN	Hey, little brother.

JACOB	Hey, big brother.  They said they're gonna take care of you.

DUNCAN	Mm-hmm.

JACOB	Fix you up good.

DUNCAN	Mmm.  Just in case things don't work out in the end.

JACOB	Don't say that.  That's not… You can keep it with you, okay?

DUNCAN	Brother magic ain't gon' make me a better looking corpse.  [LAUGH]  [COUGHING]

MARIA	Your seed is in another.  It's a boy.

PEARL	Jacob.  Are you okay?

JACOB	Yeah, I-I just-I heard a noise.

PEARL	Let's allow the boys to have their fun.

JACOB	Okay.

WITCH 1	[Baby, your first time?]

DODD	I don't know, baby.  See, let me tell you something about myself.  Dodd, he like it dirty.

MARIA	Pour you one?

JACOB	Uh, no thank you, ma'am.

MARIA	Just one.  Take the edge off.  All the men you came in with had but one thing on their minds.

JACOB	I-I guess I was just worried about my brother.

MARIA	I get the feeling it's more than that with you.

JACOB	Well, I'm sorry I-I don't mean to be rude, ma'am, but they-they're just not my type.

MARIA	Oh.  I won't say anything.  Have you ever been with a…

JACOB	No.

MARIA	Don't see that around these parts much.  So, outlaw brothers.

JACOB	Yeah, this is just a one time thing.

MARIA	This life not for you?

JACOB	I'm just out of place here.  Couldn't even pull the trigger.

MARIA	You have never taken a life?

JACOB	No.

MARIA	One of life's true innocence.

MARIA	You're a sweet boy the way you take care of your brother.

JACOB	Well, he's always taken care of me.

MARIA	I think there's only two kinds of family.  The one you're born into, and the ones you find along the way.

JACOB	Yeah.  Lester's like that for me.  Well, after my parents died, he's always looked after me.

MARIA	That's what my girls did for me.  There were some bad men and they tried to do me harm once.

JACOB	Oh yeah?

MARIA	But these girls, they risked their lives for me.  They took me into their family on the day that Pearl was born.

JACOB	May I ask what happened?

MARIA	Come with me.  Most beautiful girl.  Let go.  What are you doing?  Let go of me!  Let go!  Let… No!  Let go of me!  No, no!

COTTON	Do not be deceived.  That there is a devil.

MARIA	Cotton, please.  Just let me have my baby.  Then you can take me.  Please, Cotton.

COTTON	Restrain her.

MARIA	No!  No!  No!  No, don't hurt my baby!

COTTON	Good people of Potemkin, I have traveled many miles from the town of Salem in search of this vile woman, who shall escape God's wrath no more.  She who stands before you is among the last of a rotten breed.  One of the most impudent, scurless, wicked creatures in the world.  They which sin must go to their father, the devil, in everlasting burning.  They which never pray, god will pour out his wrath upon them.  And when they bend and pray in hell fire, god will not forgive them. 

COTTON	For there, they must lie forever.  I ask the rest of you, are you willing to go to hell and burn with the devil and his angels?  As you, in the abomination that lives inside you have been found guilty of witchcraft and must immediately be put to death.  Your burning will continue in the lake of fire for all eternity.

MARIA	[SCREAMING]  Don't be afraid, Jacob.

JACOB	And that was you?

PEARL	The day I was born.

JACOB	What?  But-but you were burned.

MARIA	We all burned.  It was the worst pain I ever felt.  And in just a few hours, it'll be exactly two centuries on this very day.

TRUMAN	Guys!  Guys!  Dodd!

DODD	Go away!

TRUMAN	Dodd, get out here!  Come on, Dodd!

DODD	I've given you enough pointers, boy, you understand?

TRUMAN	No, no!  Lis-…

DODD	I apologize for that, princess.  I… [SCREAMING]

WITCH 1	Don't stop.  I thought Dodd liked it dirty.

DODD	Oh fuck.

LESTER	Bitch!  Ah!  Bitch!  [SCREAMING]  Ah!

DODD	Ugh!  Kid!  Where the fuck you goin'?

WITCH 2	[MAKES SOUND]

WYLIE 	[MAKES SOUND]

LESTER	Come on!  Get up!  Come on!

WYLIE	Yeah, sure, right.

LESTER	[WHISTLES]  Let's go!  [SCREAMING]

MARIA	[SCREAMING]  [WHISPERING MANTRA] 

LESTER	Come on!

JACOB	They have Duncan.

LESTER	Come on!

MARIA	[WHISPERING MANTRA]  

CHIEF	[SCREAMING]

MARIA	You may kill the others.  But bring the boy to me.  [LAUGH]

DODD	Let's go!  Let's go!

WYLIE	What the fuck just happened?

LESTER	We gotta get the fuck outta this town.

DODD	By horseback, we ain't.

WYLIE	What about the others, they dead?

DODD	Yes, they dead.  Were you just comin' from the same brothel as I was?

JACOB	You left us.

DODD	Yeah, well, you know, the door was right there.  But I just saved you now, so…

LESTER	They had the drop on us.  And they just let us go.  By all accounts, we shouldn't even be alive.

JACOB	Well, they killed plenty.

LESTER	And Duncan?

JACOB	They were helping him.  And then, all this shit happened, and then he was gone.  It all happened so fast.  I don't know.

WYLIE	Doesn't make any sense.

DODD	I know, this shit makes any sense.

JACOB	Maria told me that she was burned to death the day Pearl was born, 200 years ago today.

DODD	You know, kid, if you had said that on any other given day, I just assumed you'd be kicked in the head by a horse.

JACOB	I think they need me.

WYLIE	The lord protects the righteous, not the wicked.

DODD	Well, so, we have something they want, and we can use that.

WYLIE	He's not a poker chip, Dodd.

DODD	No, but he's an advantage.  And from where we stand, we could use more like that.

JACOB	And what about Duncan?

LESTER	You said he was already gone.

JACOB	Gone, that doesn't mean he's dead.

LESTER	My god.  I don't know, son.

DODD	We ain't got a lot of options, all right?  They got the jump on us before.  Now we know what we up against, and we got the kid.

LESTER	Look, Jake, you know how much I love you, brother.

JACOB	No, stop.  I'm not leaving without him.  He made you promise, both of you, to protect me, right?

WYLIE	And that's exactly what we doin'.

JACOB	I'm going either way.  So if you two wanna keep that promise, maybe you best follow.

DODD	Well, look at the kid, huh?

DODD	Hey, look, man, I mean, if we gonna die in this anyway, I suppose we take some with us.

WYLIE	So we actually doin' this?

LESTER	Oh, shit.  Really?

DODD	And I tell you what.  I got a special one for the birthday girl.

LESTER	Okay.  So how do we get the fuck outta here?

WYLIE	They're gone.

LESTER	This is just one big fucking game to them.

DODD	And I'm done figuring shit out.  I got you.

MARIA	You are so beautiful.  You all are.  The woman at the stake, cut her down.  The sacrifice is complete.  Please give her proper burial.  Jacob, the sweet boy that my daughter ensnared, he is special, uncorrupted, innocent blood.  He alone can sustain us for decades.  Oh.

LESTER	Come on, Jacob.

JACOB	Dude, look at him.

DODD	Jacob, I got you.

JACOB	It's empty.

DODD	Your first kill.  A door.  Stick close.

FEMALE VOICE	[RECITING MANTRA]

WYLIE	What the…

LESTER	Where the hell are we?

WYLIE	I don't know.  I was hoping you could tell me.  Stepped in the door and here I am.

LESTER	Yeah, well, I had just about enough of this strange shit.

WYLIE	W-where are you going?

LESTER	That way.

WYLIE	Wait, you know where this leads?

LESTER	Look here, Wylie, one way is just as good as the next out here.  So I picks that way.

DODD	Watch it, kid.

JACOB	I know.  Duncan?

DODD	Jesus, kid.  You ever hear the element of surprise?

JACOB	Sorry.

DODD	Duncan, you here?

JACOB	What about surprise?

DODD	Yeah, there's nobody here.  I'm not sure if that makes it better or worse.

JACOB	Where'd Lester and Wylie go?

LESTER	Let's take a minute.

WYLIE	It just goes on forever.

LESTER	Yeah.  And these stars, they just a little off.

WYLIE	I think I know now why Duncan put you in charge.

LESTER	Hey, look, let's not do this.

WYLIE	I don't know.  I was bothered by it before, but now I get it.

LESTER	He did it 'cause he thought he was dying.  And I'm the closest thing that boy's got to the daddy.  Now I know y'all done been through some-some shit.  But me and those boys, we go way back.  Hold on.  Come on, let's keep walking.

DODD	Whoa!

WYLIE	Jesus.

LESTER	You boys need to learn how to announce yourself.

DODD	Yeah, you didn't announce yourself neither.  Now where the hell you'd go?  We turn around, you're gone.

WYLIE	We tried to follow you, but whatever door we went through, wasn't the same as yours.  I take it you two didn't find Duncan neither?

DODD	Ain't nothin' but a dust covered ghost town.  Like we was never there.

LESTER	Ah!  Now I know that's not your boys out there.  We just a bunch of sittin' ducks right here.

WYLIE	They're fuckin' with us, boys.

JACOB	The church.

LESTER	What?

JACOB	We-we need to get to the church.

LESTER	Fuck, all right.  This way.

WYLIE	Sure, sure.

LESTER	Over here.

WITCH 3	[MAKES SOUND]

LESTER	[SCREAMING]

JACOB	Oh my…

LESTER	Going back to the church seems like a good idea.

DODD	Take it easy.

LESTER	Okay.

JACOB	Follow me.

DODD	That's it.  All right.

LESTER	[WINCING IN PAIN]  Ah!  

JACOB	Are you okay?

LESTER	Yeah.

JACOB	Oh, shit.  What are they doing?

WYLIE	They're out there.  I don't think they can come in here.

PEARL	All we want is Jacob.  In exchange, we will give you money, women, and safe passage.

JACOB	Why me?

PEARL	You're pure blood.  [It's the key?].  There's nowhere to go.

DODD	Hey!  Hey!  Get fucked!  You don't get the kid!  You sure as fuck don't get me.

WITCH 4	[SCREAMING]

DODD	What the fuck?  Come on.

LESTER	Come on in.  Come on.

DODD	Hey, they're gone.  Yo, maybe they got scared.  Well, maybe not, but… They gone.

FEMALE VOICE	[WHISPERING MANTRA]

LESTER	We got to get the hell outta here.

WYLIE	We have a plan.

DODD	No, no, sitting here forever ain't a plan.

JACOB	Well, they can't get inside, so… It's sacred ground, maybe.

WYLIE	House of god.

DODD	House of god?  This is a coffin, boys, all right?  Now they gonna be comin' back in here and when they do, they're gonna be killin' y'all 'cause you all are the ones decidin' to live here.

LESTER	More like die here.

WYLIE	Maybe they can't get in here and maybe they can.  All I know is that not in here right now, and that is just fine by me.

DODD	They out there plottin' somethin'.  I can feel it.

JACOB	And what do you think they're up to?

DODD	Now how the fuck should I know?  They love you so much, you tell me.

JACOB	[SIGH]  Hey.  What?  No, stop, stop!

DODD	Hey, what is that?

JACOB	Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

DODD	Hey.  Hey, stop.  Stop it!

JACOB	Stop.  What?

DODD	Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop, stop, stop.  Stop.  Stop it.  Stop.  Hey.

WYLIE	[MAKES SOUND]  Ow.

DODD	Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Hey.  Hey.  Shit.

WYLIE	I'm so hungry.

DODD	Hey.

WYLIE	I'm so hungry. [CRYING]

JACOB	[SIGH]  [CRYING]  Dodd was right.  I shouldn't be here.

LESTER	Your brother knew the risk.  He wanted better for you.  He didn't want you to live with that soldier's heart.

JACOB	I'm so sick of hearing that.  There was something else going on.  He never-never talk about it.  But I know he blamed Pa for what happened.

LESTER	Yeah, he did.  And he was right.

JACOB	What?

LESTER	There's a reason those people came there.

JACOB	Yeah, yeah, for our money and our-our horses.

LESTER	No.

JACOB	And then you and Duncan went and got revenge for our family.

LESTER	No.  No!  That's just what we told you.  They didn't take any of this.  Son, those people came for blood.

JACOB	Why?  Why?

LESTER	Now there's nobody that can stop me from telling you this, but you's old enough now to hear the truth.

JACOB	What are you talking about, Lester?

LESTER	Your daddy never made a good rancher.  Matter of fact, he was horrible at that shit.  I was better than he was.  I had more experience.   I learned from my old [aura?].  So I helped him out as much as I could.  But he was the man that made me a free man.  But I-I didn't always feel that way.

JACOB	I don't know what you're saying, Lester.

LESTER	Hmm.  They forced me to do things I didn't wanna do.

JACOB	What?

LESTER	But, uh, lord, for the first time in my life, I owned the shirt that was on my back.  Everything you've got, everything you had, we took it from somebody else.

JACOB	Stole?

LESTER	That property up there on [Henit?], the ranch you grew up on, boy, we stole all of it.

JACOB	We grew that ranch to double in size.

LESTER	Yeah, yeah, and we did that, after we took it.  And that ain't all we took.  We took the cattle.  And we took the money from every other rancher that was around, yeah, as well.  Damn.  

LESTER	Duncan had no other choice.  And truth be told, you would've been involved in all this shit as well.  Our stories had already been written.  [SIGH]  He never wanted you to walk in his footsteps.  And he never, ever wanted you to carry the kind of hate in your heart that he carried in his.

DUNCAN	Jake!  Jacob!  Jake!

JACOB	You're not hurt?

DUNCAN	No.  The women, they fixed me up.

JACOB	[LAUGH]  Hey, big brother.

DUNCAN	Hello, Jake.  What's wrong?

JACOB	You're not Duncan.  You're not my brother.

LESTER	Shit!  Ugh.  [COUGHING]  [THROWING UP]

JACOB	Lester.

DODD	No, where you going?  Hey, whoa.

DODD	Okay.

DODD	Okay, I got you.  I got you.  All right.  Wylie!  Wylie, get your ass over here.

JACOB	It's fine, okay.

JACOB	You're gonna be all right, Lester.  You're gonna be fine.  [CRYING]  Please don't go.  [Boy, you're a real one?].  Come on, please.  Please.

FEMALE VOICE	[WHISPERING]  Jacob.  Hey.  [WHISPERING MANTRA]  

JACOB	Wylie?

FEMALE VOICE	[WHISPERING MANTRA]

WYLIE	We walked through the pale doors.  And hell was our reward.

DODD	Wylie?

JACOB	Wy-… No, stop!  Wylie!

FEMALE VOICE	[WHISPERING MANTRA]

DODD	[SIGH]  Listen to me, kid.  It's been dark out way too long.  Sun ain't comin' up.  We barely have enough ammo for one, let alone both.  We are not safe here.  [MAKES SOUND]  

DODD	I know.  I don't know if it's any consolation to you, you know you ain't the only one who lost a brother.  Maybe not by blood.  I never had no fuckin' family.  I was raised in a goddamn brothel.  [LAUGH]  And, uh, Duncan was my brother too.  You-you may think I don't give a shit, and I-I don't.  I had a role to play and I played it.  

DODD	But you don't think for a second you're alone.  Now, we gonna-we're gon' walk out and either find our way outta this labyrinth, or go down swingin', okay?

JACOB	I only got one left.

DODD	Me too.  Do not let them take ya, you understand?  Save it for yourself.

DODD	Whoa!


WITCH 5	[RECITING MANTRA]  She's crowning.

DODD	Hey, kid.  Stay there.  Turn all yellow on me now, all right?

JACOB	I-I got this.  

DODD	Stay with me.  Hey, listen, when we get outta this, I want you to promise me something.  Become a farmer because an outlaw, you're bad fucking luck.  Okay.  She's gone.  All right.  We'll go that way.

WITCHES	[SCREAMING]

DODD	Go!  Go!  Go!  Don't turn back!  I am done runnin'.  We had this date for a while.  Come on!  [LAUGH]

WITCHES	[MAKES SOUND]

DODD	No!  [SCREAMING]

JACOB	I won't let you take me too.

MARIA	We can offer you…

JACOB	What?  Money?  Women?  Men?

MARIA	Your brother.

JACOB	He's alive?

MARIA	Yes.

JACOB	Bullshit.  I don't believe you.

MARIA	No!

JACOB	Why do you even care?

PEARL	If you do that, your innocence will be gone.  You will have taken a life, and for that, your blood will be tainted.

MARIA	You'll just be another soiled soul.

JACOB	Let me see my brother.  Hey, big brother.  Hey, big brother.  What, you take me for a fool, huh?  That's not my…

DUNCAN	Hey, little brother.  Jake.  Jake. 
 
JACOB	Are you okay?  Oh my god.

DUNCAN	I'm sore because the ladies gave me somethin'.  What's goin' on here, Jake?

JACOB	I-I need you to do somethin'.

DUNCAN	What is it, little brother?

JACOB	It's not gonna be easy.

DUNCAN	What is it, little brother, what is it?

JACOB	Forgive father.

DUNCAN	Why do you say that?

JACOB	No.  Buy back the farm.  And the hate.


DUNCAN	Why?  Why are you sayin' that?

JACOB	He loved you too.  He loved you too.  You finally get to make a choice.

MARIA	Do we have a deal?

JACOB	I want assurances he'll be safe or I swear to god I'll do it.

DUNCAN	Jake, what are you doing, Jake?

JACOB	No, stop.  Let me do this one thing, please.  Let me be the one who protects you for a change.

DUNCAN	I'm your older brother, I'm…

JACOB	I know.  And you gotta leave.  You gotta leave.  Go back to that pretty lady of yours.  Make a family.  Have a life that you couldn't, that dad couldn't.  Come on.  You let 'em know.

MARIA	Our power ends at the town's edge.  We control who can leave.

JACOB	Up, up.  I'll watch him leave.

DUNCAN	I love you, little brother.

JACOB	I love you, big brother.

DUNCAN	Hey, girls.  Come on now.  Have yourselves a little supper.  Come on.  There little one.  There you go.

DUNCAN'S WIFE	Are you comin' in soon?  Need to put little Jacob to bed.

DUNCAN	Soon.
