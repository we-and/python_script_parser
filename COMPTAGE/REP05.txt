Gladys	Dineo!	 Dineo, I'm begging you. Please don't do this.
		
Junior 	Go to the butchery.
		
Gladys	Dineo! Dineo, this is not a game.	
	
Junior 	Go to the butchery.
		
Gladys	Dineo, listen to me!
		
Junior 	Go to the butchery!
		
Gladys	You shut up! Listen to me! Please don't do this.
		
Dineo 	I must save my parents!
		
Karabo 	Run!
		
Katlego 	Rocky, Rocky! Rocky, get her! Get her! Rocky, get her! It's not her!
		
Minister of Police	Katlego! Do you have the President? No, we don't have eyes on her, Minister!
		
Minster of Finance	I...
		
Deputy President	Arrest this bastard!
		
Minster of Finance	Deputy...
		
Deputy President	Arrest this bastard!
		
Minster of Finance	Hey! I'm your Minister, boys! Minister. Deputy, I can explain. Victor! Victor...
		
Guard	Let's go, Minister.
		
Deputy President	Go away!
		
Thabang	Didi. My girl.
		
Bridget 	Okay, okay...Okay, okay.
		
Deputy President	Speak.
		
Moses	Relax. I'm on it. There will be police everywhere.
		
Deputy President	Then you'll have a chance to disappear.
		
Moses	No problem. Everything will go according to plan.	
	
President Mulaudzi 	And my request?
		
Moses	You'll get it. Give me 30 minutes. That dog will be dead. And you, my leadership, Maquthu.
		
Dineo 	Dad. Did I kill him?
		
Thabang	No, no, Dineo. Look at me. Didi. My girl, it's not your fault. It's not your fault! Do you hear me? I should have protected you. Please don't blame yourself, my girl. Do you hear me? It's not your fault, okay?	
	
Bridget 	Listen to your father, baby. Listen to your father. You did nothing wrong, okay.
		
Thabang 	How did you get here?
		
Dineo 	Granny and I tied him up. Then I took his gun and came here.
		
Thabang 	How, Didi? Is Granny fine?
		
Dineo 	He wanted some food. So I went to the kitchen, grabbed the knife and stabbed him. I stabbed him!
		
Bridget 	Okay, baby.
		
Thabang 	Don't cry. Don't cry, Didi.
		
Dineo 	I'm sorry.
		
Bridget 	You did nothing wrong, Dineo.
		
Thabang 	Do you have your phone, my girl?
		
Bridget 	Do you have your phone?
		
Thabang 	Lend it to me.
		
Bridget 	Okay, baby. Shh...
		
Gladys	Pure rubbish! Every child in South Africa envied to be just like you… and live like you.	 Little did they know that you're nothing but trash in fancy clothes! Dineo? Where are you?	
	
Thabang 	Ma. It's not Dineo. It's me, Thabang. Dineo is here with us. She saved mine and Bridget's lives.
		
Gladys	Praise the Lord!
		
Thabang 	Where are you? Are you fine? Dineo says you overpowered Junior.		
Gladys	I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine. Just get back here fast, before this boy's blood is all over my house.
		
Thabang 	No, Ma.	 Call the police now. I don't want you to be alone with him for long.		
Gladys	What do you take me for? I've already called them. I hope they get here fast. I hear things are still bad out there. Listen, how did Dineo save you?	
	
Thabang 	We'll talk about that later, Ma. Everything is under control. Look, I'll see you soon.
		
Gladys	Take care of your family.	 I'm fine. I'm doing just fine.
		
Deputy President	Minister of Police,	 Minister of Defence, Correctional Services...and Minister of Health, stay where you are. Everyone else, please excuse us. Excuse us! Get out! Get out, get out! Close the door! You're remained here...because I trust you. I trust you with my life. If any information we discuss here goes out there and help the enemy, I'll know who to blame. Am I clear? How far are we...with saving the President?
		
Minister of Police	Well, I have my best team on the ground. They're ready to breach in the riot.
		
Deputy President	Uhhuh? They mustn't kill anyone. I don't want anyone to die.
		
Minister of Police	Of course not.	 This is just crowd control in order to bring the President back safely.
		
Deputy President	Go ahead.
		
News Reporter 1	Thembekile, 15 minutes ago, a cash van arrived here in Soshanguve...and it is believed that the very same cash van…is carrying the R1.2 billion ransom...that The Dogs of Soshanguve demanded...in exchange for the release of our President Mulaudzi. Thembekile, in light of the blockade... behind me, it was assumed that the truck would not be able to access…this township, as you can see that the situation is very tense. But in a turn of events, the truck managed to break through this barrier, and it is within Soshanguve.	 But as of now, we haven't received any official statement from the Presidency…	as to whether the President is still alive.
		
Katlego 	This has never happened before. What did the Minister say to us? There must be no loss of human life! Am I clear?
		
Policemen 	Yes, sir!
		
Police Voice 	What about the dogs?
		
Katlego 	Is this a joke to you?	 I'll feed you to the dogs myself! You know what, stand over there! Stand by the door! We've got strict instructions here! I want you to go, as my first unit! Understood?
		
Police Voice 	 Yes, sir!
		
Katlego 	What you're going to do, is to disperse the crowd for me! I'll come out with my own team! Am I clear?
		
Policemen 	Yes, sir! Yes, sir.
		
Katlego 	I'll go with my team!	 And I'll go down each and every one of these streets, and look for the President! She's our number one priority! Off you go! I said, off you go!	 And don't you dare embarrass me on national TV! Tell me you've got good news for me. What's the location of that cashintransit van?	
	
Female Anyalyst	There's nothing, sir.	 I've been searching the satellite feed, but I can't see it.
		
Katlego 	Shit. Okay.	 Just keep working on it, okay. Please.
		
Bridget 	This dog is so heavy!
		
Thabang 	We need a plan.	 We must get out of here. The township is still in lockdown. We're not safe here.
		
Bridget 	I'm worried more Dogs could be on their way.	
	
Thabang 	There must be a way, Bridge.
		
Dineo 	Do you know where the President might be?	
	
Thabang 	I don't know.
		
Moses 	Talk to me, KB.	 Do you have the chicken? Affirmative. I've got the chicken. We've stopped for some prayers before lunch. Sharp. Keep praying. I'm on my way.
		
Thabang 	I think they took the President to the church. I have to call Katlego.
		
Bridget 	I agree with you.	 I think you should go and see Katlego before Moses…	
	
Thabang 	I can't go. I need to protect you and Dineo.
		
Bridget 	Listen, I'm sorry for yelling at you earlier. I was angry. You're a good father to Dineo. You didn't let her down.
		
Thabang 	I did, though.
		
Bridget 	Yes, but we can always talk about that after this saga. What's important right now is that you go and protect the President. Get there before Moses.	
	
Thabang 	Bridge, I...
		
Bridget 	Go.
		
Thabang 	Didi! Bye-bye, my girl.
		
Dineo 	Dad...
		
President Mulaudzi 	You're the only one who knows how all of this is going end. If...you get me out of here...it's up to You. I wronged this community...when I gave them empty promises. I followed in the same footsteps of the leaders who came before me. They went out there, telling communities that things would change, making promises...and failed to deliver on the promises they made before the elections. I'm not different from them. I asked...this community...to believe in me. I asked them to have faith...that things would change. I asked them to remain patient...until we better their lives. How could I ask that of them...when they'd been waiting their whole lives? How can they not be impatient? Hope...is nothing without action. Hope is action. Hope is service delivery.	 Hope goes hand in hand with practice. I failed quite a bit on that last part.
		
Katlego 	I'm going to the West, you head to the East! Okay? And don't worry, we'll have police support coming any time soon now. Alright? Find the President! Go!	
	
Minister 1	Yes. But a good plan here, Deputy President. We've got security guards all over here as he walks in. It's a good plan. Good plan, indeed.
		
Minister of Police	All right. Thanks.
		
Deputy President	What are they saying?
		
Minister of Police	My people are in Soshanguve. They managed to break through the blockage.
		
Deputy President	Mm. You do pray, right?
		
Minister of Police	Huh?
		
Deputy President	Pray that nothing happens to our President. Otherwise, I'm coming after you.
		
President Mulaudzi 	It is well, it is well...when I'm with You! It is well, it is well...when I'm with You. Time for games is over! I'm your Lord! She's been praying for a while.
		
Karabo 	She thinks the Lord is as corrupt as she is. I need the bathroom.
		
Moses	Rubbish! Fufu! If you want to pray, don't waste your time. You're looking at the Lord! You pray to me. I'm the Lord, your God. Yeah! Soshanguve... is on fire.	 I love the smell of teargas in the township. It reminds me of the old times. Right now, the police...have kept everyone busy. They're shooting left, right and center! It's bad! But you...won't see any of it. Nothing. Nothing!
		
President Mulaudzi 	Moses, I'm not afraid of death. I've been ready to die since the age of 16… when I decided to join the struggle. I knew then, that I was prepared to die...for our country's freedom. The same freedom that I respect. At some point, you also fought for it. It's sad that you've turned into some monster that's determined…to destroy the democracy we've fought so hard for. What went wrong?	 What happened to you? Hm? Just look at you. You've become...the failed soldier! You're no longer a soldier! You're a failure, Matseke. A failure.
		
Moses	Me? A failure?Democracy is failure. Black people were turned into puppets! And lamb is taken to the butchery...and given to those with status. Bullshit! This system only benefits the rich. The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer! If there's any god that I pray to, it's only one. Money. Money! Money.	 Sha-sha... Tito Mboweni. Sha-sha! Time to say goodbye, Venda girl.
		
Bridget 	It's okay. It's okay.
		
Dineo 	It's a war zone out there.	 Why is this happening? Why? What happened? What's...
		
Bridget 	 the people are tired.	 They are angry. When people are angry, they retaliate like a dog that had its tail stepped on. Our people believed in a dream once, baby.	 They've been living a nightmare ever since. Our people have been given promises. But nothing has changed. They are still poor. Meanwhile, rich people like Zondo, have money flowing down their pockets. Those people are corrupt. So, people snapped.
		
Dineo 	Will it ever end?
		
Bridget 	Oh, I have to believe that change is possible, Didi. It's the only way I could live. You too. You should too. If...When...President Mulaudzi comes out of this, she will rebuild our country.	
	
Dineo 	Yes.
		
Bridget 	I knew she was the one the first moment I saw her. Let's just hope that your father gets to her in time. Otherwise, things will get worse.
		
Thabang 	Matseke! The police are out there, surrounding this place. If you want to get out of here alive,  surrender yourself! I promise I won't shoot you.
		
Moses 	Get lost! Bloody bodyguard! Look, I've got an idea. How about you come out so I can see you?
		
Thabang 	Don't make this harder than it already is, Matseke! Your plan has failed. You've lost! Huh! I'm your one last chance.	
	
Moses 	Last chance, my foot! Look... you know what, I'll teach you a lesson! I've been killing Afrikaners for ages! Now you want to bring your stupid system just so you can steal money? Over my dead body! I'll...
		
Thabang 	Damn it!
		
Moses 	Ha... I've got you!	 "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani." "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Come out! Come out, son of a witch! Your mom smells like atchar! Boy, I want to show you how the game is played. Come out!
		
Thabang 	Madam President, how bad is it?
		
President Mulaudzi 	Don't worry about me. I've been through worse than this. Go and check on that boy.
		
Thabang 	He's alive, but unconscious.
		
President Mulaudzi 	Mind your language in the Holy Temple.
		
Thabang 	At least we have a phone.
		
Katlego 	Take him away!	 He knows something!	 Are you just standing there? Bring him out! Thabang. Wait, wait! What? Where? I'm on my way there now! Let's move!
		
President Mulaudzi 	Listen here, call me back when you get this message.	
	
Minister of Police	Eish! Katlego, listen...I want to be updated every step of the way, okay. Don't keep me waiting. Bye. Eish! Chief. Madam President still hasn't been found. But don't worry, my team has infiltrated Soshanguve. They will turn every stone and primus stove until they find her.	
	
President Mulaudzi 	Okay. Thank you, Comrade.
		
Minister of Police	I just don't understand...why they went through such great lengths. I mean, shutting down the whole township? Let's think this through. Why would Zondo pull our attention to Soshanguve? It's as like he's diverting our focus there.
		
Deputy President	What are you thinking?
		
Minister of Police	Katlego told me that Zondo is planning to flee the country. I just don't get how he plans to do that when he's in prison.
		
Deputy President	Prison break!
		
Minister of Police	Prison break.
		
Deputy President	Tell your people at Kgosi Mampuru...to secure his location there. Zondo has people everywhere. They'll try to help him escape.	
	
Minister of Police	I'm on it.
		
Deputy President	Huh?
		
Minister of Police	Hello.		
Minister of Police	Katlego, listen.
		
Voicemail Operator 	Welcome to voicemail. Please leave a voice or fax message after the tone.
		
Bridget 	Are you feeling calmer, baby?	
	
Dineo 	Mm.
		
Bridget 	Good. It's gone quiet now, let's go.	
	
Dog 1	Where are they?
		
Dog 2	Aren't they here?
		
Thabang 	Madam President, please keep your eyes open. Don't sleep. Please, the ambulance is on the way.
		
President Mulaudzi 	Thabang.
		
Thabang 	Ma'am?
		
President Mulaudzi 	Your wife...is a good person. You have a wonderful wife. Fight for her, okay. Don't let your family go.	
	
Thabang 	But Madam President, when injured people start giving advice, I get worried.
		
President Mulaudzi 	Listen, Ranaka. You're a good man. Bridget knows that.
		
Thabang 	Ma'am. I will fight for them.
		
President Mulaudzi 	Don't give up either, please.	
	
Thabang 	Madam President, Ma'am...Ma'am, please stay with me.	
	
Katlego 	Thabang!
		
Thabang 	Katlego! We're over here, Katlego!	
	
Katlego 	Thabang!  Over here!
		
Thabang 	Katlego is here.
		
President Mulaudzi 	What?
		
Katlego 	Madam President, I'm so sorry. This should never have happened. I take full responsibility.	
	
President Mulaudzi 	No, Katlego. It's not your fault. I insisted on coming here. You did your job.
		
Ambulance Man 1	Please just move back. Give us some space, please. Thank you.
		
Deputy President	Are your people moving Zondo?
		
Minster of Correctional Service	Yes, Comrade. Everything is under control.
		
Minister of Police	Yes, Katlego. Talk to me. What? Madam President has been shot.
		
Deputy President	Oh, Lord!
		
Minister of Police	Huh?
		
Deputy President	Lord! I said it. I said it. I told you to deploy the police there. I told you to deploy the police fast! But you refused! You refused! Huh? You see what happened now! This is a disaster! Internationally! They won't let us get away with this! Huh? This is rubbish! Our first female President died like this? This is all your fault.
		
Minister of Police	No, no, Deputy. She's alive. She's been shot, but she's alive. The ambulance is on its way. She's going to make it.	
	
Deputy President	Oh. Thank goodness! Thank goodness.
		
Karabo 	Lord!
		
Thabang 	There was a firefight. But he ran off. Katlego...
		
Katlego 	Yes? Where? Maybe Moses is there too. Okay. Thank you so much.
		
Main Dog	Hey!
		
Bridget 	Okay, okay. We're unarmed.
		
Main Dog	Hurry up! Come here.
		
Bridget 	I don't know what you want from me, a slay queen like you. Please, my brother. Who's a slay queen? Okay, Didi. Listen, help Mommy find the pin. Hurry up, Dineo.
		
Minister of Police	Keep me posted.	 I can confirm that for medical attention. How is her condition? In an ambulance,
		
Deputy President	That's good news. Keep up the good work. No more mistakes today, okay? And the money? They are on the way now. Great job.
		
Bridget 	Oh, God! Find it, baby.
		
Thabang 	Bridge. I got you. No, no. Just...Bridge, please. Look at me. Let it go.
		
News Reporter 1	The scene is quite jarring and police has intensified, in order to search for the President, who has been missing for some time now. but we've had word that she has been shot…protesters are running from water gazing at water canons and disruptions, but our country they'd hoped it would.
		
Bridget 	Have you found the President?
		
Thabang 	But they are taking her to the military hospital. But they managed to catch Moses there. We need to get home.	
	
Katlego	Shit!
		
Prison Guard 1	You've been singing loud like a bird,
		
Prison Guard 2	Sir.
		
Hendrik	Are you okay?
		
Moses 	Not so long. Junior?
		
Junior 	Dad! Don't worry, I'm fine. You should see the other guy.	
	
Thabang 	Ma? Wait here with Didi. Ma?
		
Bridget 	Thabang!
		
Thabang 	Mama. Ma. Ma! Ma. Oh...Ma. Oh...
