KAREN	Amalie!

KAREN	Amalie, I still don’t have your column and our Christmas edition is only one week away!

AMALIE	Uhh, you're gonna have it tomorrow.

KAREN	Why not now?

AMALIE	Because it hasn’t happened yet.

AMALIE	Here, I’ll show you what I’ve started.

KAREN	Bruce asked you to marry him.

AMALIE	No, not yet. But I know it's gonna happen tonight.

AMALIE	I’ve been hinting for weeks that Christmas is the most romantic time to propose. And he’s cooking something special tonight and he said there’s something he wants to talk to me about.

KAREN	And this picture?

AMALIE	Oh, that’s my “engaged” face. 

KAREN	Hmm.

AMALIE	I’ve been practicing and trying different looks.

AMALIE	I started with 

AMALIE	"Very Excited!"

KAREN	(CHUCKLING) That’s a bit much.

AMALIE	Then, I tried "Swooning with Passion”.

KAREN	That’s ...frightening.

AMALIE	Which led me to

AMALIE	"Just Glow"

KAREN	Much better

AMALIE	(CHUCKLES)

KAREN	Do you have a back up column? Just...in case?

AMALIE	Oh, I don’t need a back up column. I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life.

KAREN	Ok

BRUCE	Okay…

BRUCE	(CLEARS THROAT)

BRUCE	Alright, here I come! No peeking.

AMALIE	Can I open them yet?

BRUCE	No, no. Not yet.

AMALIE	How about now?

BRUCE	No, no. Not ready, not yet.

BRUCE	Just about there.

BRUCE	Ok. Now.

AMALIE	Oh, It’s...beautiful. It's 

AMALIE	It's eggplant.

BRUCE	Mhm.

AMALIE	With extra garlic.

BRUCE	Just the way we both like it.

AMALIE	Right.

AMALIE	Umm…

AMALIE	Is there anything else?

BRUCE	Yes, yes, of course. Of course. Yeah.

BRUCE	You know me all too well.

BRUCE	Fresh out of the oven.

BRUCE	Please, please. Don't wait for me to get started.

BRUCE	How was your day?

AMALIE	It was good. I thought I knew what I was going to write about for my Christmas column, but…

AMALIE	I guess not.

BRUCE	I’m sure you’ll figure something out.

AMALIE	Seems I'm gonna have to. 

AMALIE	How was your day?

BRUCE	Oh, my day was great. 

BRUCE	Had an allergy shot…

BRUCE	...and, uh, got the car washed.

AMALIE	Mmm…

BRUCE	And uh...I think we should get married.

AMALIE	Huh?

BRUCE	Pardon.

BRUCE	I said, I think we should get married.

AMALIE	Did you just...propose to me?

BRUCE	Sure.

AMALIE	Just…like that?

BRUCE	Oh my gosh. No, uh…

BRUCE	Here.

BRUCE	Now, I have us confirmed for the Weisman lecture tomorrow night. It should be fascinating. We're talking Population Pyramids into Population Columns… What do you think? 7:30, pick you up?

AMALIE	No.

BRUCE	7:45.

AMALIE	No, I…I mean... I don’t think we should get married.

AMALIE	I know I said that's what I wanted. I do want that. I just thought  This is just…wrong. It’s all wrong and I'm

BRUCE	Amalie?

AMALIE	I gotta go.

BRUCE	Woah, woah…Amalie! What’s going on here? You’re being irrational.

AMALIE	I'm sorry. So sorry, Bruce. I just can’t do this.

AMALIE	Goodbye.

KAREN	Amalie…you came back.

KAREN	How’d it go?

KAREN	You’re not wearing a ring. He didn’t propose?

AMALIE	Well, technically, he did... Yes.

KAREN	What happened?

AMALIE	Nothing!

KAREN	Nothing?

AMALIE	No flowers

AMALIE	No candles, No getting down on one knee no “I love you”. Just

AMALIE	“I think we should get married.” 

AMALIE	And eggplant.

KAREN	What’s wrong with eggplant?

AMALIE	I hate eggplant!

KAREN	Well, then why did you have it?

AMALIE	Because Bruce loves eggplant.

KAREN	Well, that’s not a reason to have egg

AMALIE	Karen, you’re missing the point.

AMALIE	I was the perfect girlfriend. I’m always the perfect girlfriend. 	

AMALIE	I laughed at all his jokes. I went to all his boring conferences. I did whatever he wanted to do! And I get...

AMALIE	 ...“I think we should get married.”

AMALIE	Eggplant. 

AMALIE	Nobody deserves a proposal like that!

KAREN	Absolutely!

KAREN	So, how did you two leave things?

AMALIE	We broke up.

KAREN	I’m so sorry.

AMALIE	Thank you.

KAREN	I hate to bring this up now, but, you know…Editor and…your column.	

AMALIE	Oh! My column! Right.

KAREN	I think we should run something else in your space. I have a whole pile of submissions from freelancers

AMALIE	Oh no, no. My readers expect a Love Notes column and I'm going to give it to them. I’ve never missed a publication and I don't intend to.

KAREN	But you just broke up with your boyfriend at Christmas. And well...it's you.

KAREN	You must be devastated.

AMALIE	I am devastated. But, I’m also a professional.

KAREN	There’s only three days...

AMALIE	No! I still have three days. I’m going to write the most romantic Love Notes column you’ve ever seen. I've got a whole file of ideas right here.

KAREN	What is it?

AMALIE	It's weird…It’s a letter from my hometown. But my friends usually send my Christmas Cards to my appartment

KAREN	Oh, let me see that.

KAREN	Dear Amalie. I always think of you this time of year. But this year I can’t stop wishing you were here, wishing I could hold your hand again, wishing I could see your beautiful face.

KAREN	You’d light up my world every time I saw you. Just by being you. You made me realize I wanted to be a better man in the hopes that maybe someday, some way, I could be worthy of you. 

KAREN	Your inspiration has made me the person I am today. I know things never worked out between us but this year I realized I had to let you know, that Christmas we spent together, that was the best Christmas of my life.

KAREN	Wow! That is some letter!

KAREN	You okay?

AMALIE	Yes. Of course.

KAREN	So ... who’s it from?

AMALIE	It’s unsigned.

AMALIE	 And there’s no return address.

KAREN	That’s strange. And annoying.

AMALIE	No. 

AMALIE	That's romantic!

AMALIE	An unsigned Christmas love letter. A mystery ex-boyfriend. 	

AMALIE	This is what I’ve been waiing for.

KAREN	For your column!

AMALIE	For my life! 

AMALIE	This is why things never seemed quite right with any of my other boyfriends. 

AMALIE	It's because my true love, my real true love was out there waiting for me!

KAREN	Hey, I..I still need a column. Where are you going?

AMALIE	Home!

KAREN	I need that column in three days or you lose you space!

AMALIE	Can I use that real quick? I wanna surprise Dad.

AMALIE	Christmas delivery!

RAY	Amalie!

RAY	I thought we planned for me to come to Atlanta this year

AMALIE	I hope you don’t mind. I decided to come home for Christmas.	

RAY	Absolutely not. I'm thrilled you're here. When is Bruce coming?

AMALIE	I’d rather not get into that.

AMALIE	I'm actually focusing on writing a new column.

AMALIE	Hi, Mrs. Crabtree. So nice seeing you again.

RAY	Mrs. Crabtree, do you remember my daughter Amalie?

MRS. CRABTREE	I liked your other girl better.

MRS. CRABTREE	Where’s Holly?

AMALIE	Mrs. Crabree, dad doesn’t have any other children. Holly was a dog.

MRS. CRABTREE	Well, of course she was a dog. I never said she wasn't, did I?

MRS. CRABTREE	I want some more coffee.

AMALIE	I can get you some more.

MRS. CRABTREE	Get away! Don't just, just get away from me!

AMALIE	Ok

RAY	Mary, could you sit with Mrs. Crabtree for awhile? Thank you.

AMALIE	I know Mrs. Crabtree has always been a bit well... crabby but...

RAY	It’s just her anxiety gets the better of her these days. 

RAY	But finding a new service dog with the right temperament has been difficult. And now Mrs. Crabtree has developed some pretty severe allergies.

AMALIE	How are you doing, Dad? 

AMALIE	You seem tired.

RAY	I’m all right.

RAY	So...what about the column?

AMALIE	It’s...about love...and second chances. 

AMALIE	I found this unsigned love letter in a Christmas card and I’m trying to figure out who sent it.

RAY	What about Bruce?

AMALIE	It’s just a column, Dad...

AMALIE	But, I'm going to go look through some old stuff at the 

House

AMALIE	See you later?

RAY	Yes.

RAY	I just have to finish a few things and I’ll see you there.

AMALIE	Okay.

RAY	Okay.

RAY	I am so happy to have you here for Christmas.

AMALIE	Me too.

AMALIE	Hey!

AMALIE	Will Rivers

AMALIE	Joseph Harrington

AMALIE	Sander Monk

AMALIE	Oh!

AMALIE	Hmmm…

AMALIE	This must be the secret home of the glitter squirrels. 

AMALIE	They spend all their time eating rainbow acorns and starlight nuts…

AMALIE	... and when they move their tails, glitter goes everywhere!

AMALIE	(GASP)

AMALIE	Why, you’re not a glitter squirrel.

AMALIE	You don’t even have a tail.

MARTY	No, silly! I’m Marty.

AMALIE	I’m Amalie.

MARTY	Amalie Hess?

AMALIE	Yes. 

AMALIE	How did you know that?

MARTY	Well, my dad reads your column every week. He never misses it!	

AMALIE	Huh, I thought my only dad reader was my own.

AMALIE	But I'm happy to hear I’m wrong. What brings you to my thinking spot?

AMALIE	What brings you to my thinking spot?

MARTY	It's your thinking spot, too?

AMALIE	Ever since I was about your age.

AMALIE	But I don’t really live here anymore, so...I'm happy that someone else gets to use it.

AMALIE	So, what brings you out here today?

MARTY	I was making tree ornaments for Christmas presents. But the glitter won’t stick.

AMALIE	Can I see it?

AMALIE	Oh, I think it needs more glue. 

AMALIE	I can help you if it’s okay with your mom and dad.

AMALIE	Well... my mom is with my grandma and grandpa. You can ask my dad. He's amazing. He's

IAN	Marty?

MARTY	Here!

MARTY	Dad! You can't believe who I saw in my thinking spot!

IAN	What, honey?

AMALIE	Ian McCallister!

MARTY	Amelie Hess.

IAN	Amelie.

IAN	Wow.

IAN	What?

AMALIE	So good to see you.

IAN	Yeah, you too. I was just thinking about you. 

AMALIE	What are you doing back in Helen? I thought your parents moved to Tucson.

IAN	Yeah, they did. But we decided to move back earlier this year.	

AMALIE	Well this is where social media would be helpful because then I would know this.

IAN	Yeah, I never really got into that. 

IAN	So, what are you back for? Are you here for the holidays?

AMALIE	Yes...And I am working on a new column.

IAN	Ah

AMALIE	I heard you’re one of my biggest dad fans.

IAN	I do like to keep up, yeah.

IAN	So, what's…what's the new one you're working on about?

AMALIE	It’s...sort of a...secret project.

MARTY	We have a secret project, too.

IAN	We do.

MARTY	Can we tell her?

AMALIE	Oh, I don’t want to ruin the secret.

IAN	Well it'st not that big of a secret. I'm sure we could maybe come by and show it to you? It's easier to show than to tell.

AMALIE	Yeah, sounds great!

IAN	Alright. 

IAN	Well, we'll run some errands and we'll swing by.

AMALIE	Perfect

MARTY	Amelie. Me and my dad have loved meeting you today and my dad loves to read your column every

IAN	Ok, that's our cue. 

IAN	See you.

AMALIE	Bye.

RAY	Yes, yes, that's correct. Yes, I’m not asking for an increase in city funds, Mayor.

RAY	Just a temporary loan, until we can make up the cash flow difference in donations…

RAY	I see... 

RAY	Yes. 

RAY	Ok. Well, uh, thank you, anyway.

AMALIE	Hi, Mom. I’m home.

RAY	Find what you were looking for?

AMALIE	I think so.

RAY	Good.

AMALIE	Sorry.

AMALIE	It's Bruce. I'm gonna take that upstairs

AMALIE	Hello, Bruce.

BRUCE	Amalie, hi! Just confirming for the Weisman lecture on population pyramids tonight.

AMALIE	Wati, What? No. Bruce. We broke up.

BRUCE	What? When?

AMALIE	Last night.

AMALIE	You proposed well, sort of. I said no. And then I said goodbye.

BRUCE	Well, yeah, I just thought that was goodbye. Not, you know, goodbye…

BRUCE	...forever.

AMALIE	Well, I’m sorry, but…it it was.

BRUCE	Wait, ok, did I do something? 

BRUCE	I mean, uh, didn’t you want me to propose? All that talk about Christmas proposals and

AMALIE	I did, but…

AMALIE	I don't know, it just...wasn’t right.

BRUCE	How so?

AMALIE	It just didn't feel right, and…it wasn’t a very romantic and I'm

BRUCE	Romantic? You mean like the flowers and, you know, like, taking a knee and choreographed dance

AMALIE	Well yeah, it would have been nice.

BRUCE	Oh! Wow, I just never took you for the romantic type.

AMALIE	What? Bruce, have you read any of my columns?

BRUCE	(STAMMERING)…Not really

AMALIE	Listen, I gotta go.

AMALIE	Good luck and goodbye.

BRUCE	Um...wait, wait no, but, uh.….

AMALIE	Hi!

IAN	Hey!

MARTY	Hi, Amalie! Boy, it gets colder than a banker's heart out there !

IAN	Marty McCalister! Where did you hear that?

MARTY	We brought her!

AMALIE	Her?

IAN	Oh, you’ll see, right?

MARTY	Yeah.

AMALIE	Dad, you remember Ian McCallister.

RAY	Of course! Hey, Ian, good to see you again,

IAN	How you doing, how you doing? Yeah. I like what you've done with the place.

RAY	Oh, thanks.

AMALIE	And this is his daughter Marty.

MARTY	Hi, Mr. Hess! We brought our secret project. Would you all like to see her?

RAY	Absolutely. 

IAN	Let's go.

RAY	Right in there.

IAN	It’ll just take a second.

RAY	Okay.

RAY	So... Ian McCallister is back in town.

AMALIE	Yeah.

RAY	I always liked that boy.

AMALIE	Of course. It's Ian. What’s not to like?

MARTY	Ok, we're all set.

AMALIE	Aww...

RAY	Just like my Holly when she was a puppy.

IAN	Well, what do you think of us naming her after Holly?

AMALIE	She’s...not a real dog?

IAN	That's right.

IAN	She's a companion dog. A robot. A prototype

IAN	Yeah,we’ve been working on her for about a year now.

AMALIE	But she feels so real. Dad, pet her!

RAY	She even moves like a real dog.

IAN	She responds to voice commands.

RAY	Wow.

AMALIE	Like what?

MARTY	Holly, speak!

HOLLY	(BARKING)

MARTY	Holly, speak!

HOLLY	(MEOWS LIKE A KITTEN)

IAN	You’ve been messing with the voicebox again, haven’t you?

HOLLY	(MEOWING CONTINUES)

IAN	See, now this is the problem with having a daughter with such a high IQ.

IAN	Truth is - we've been working out a few kinks. We're having some trouble finding just the right sounds for her.

AMALIE	Oh, Dad, do you still have those old, uh, videos of Holly when she was a puppy?

RAY	I think I do.

AMALIE	You think those would work?

AMALIE	There will definitely be some puppy sounds on there.

IAN	That would be great. Yeah.

MARTY	Can I go help?

RAY	Yeah, let's go look now.

MARTY	You guys stay here and talk about the good old days.

IAN	Ok.

IAN	She really does have a mind of her own.

AMALIE	She’s a great kid. Speaking of the good old days, I was thinking of looking some people up, but I don’t know who’s around anymore.

IAN	Anyone in particular?

AMALIE	I don’t know. Maybe...Will Rivers…or Joseph Harrington...Sander Monk

IAN	All your old boyfriends?

AMALIE	Other people, too. But seriously, you don’t know if any of them are still around, do you?

IAN	I don't. Actually, I’ve been really busy with Marty and Holly. 

IAN	Demi is the editor of the Helen Herald. She's gotta know. She knows everybody in town. Everything that's going on.

AMALIE	Yeah, I was actually planning on dropping by her office tomorrow. So, I'll I’ll ask her then.


IAN	Okay.

HOLLY	(BARKING)

DEMI	No, sir, I No, sir. I I can't write a column about your missing bacon...

DEMI	No. Just...I know it's important. Just maybe you should speak to your wife…maybe she's the one that ate it. Yeah 

DEMI	Isn’t that what happened last time? YeYeah, sir. I'll...I'll call you back.

DEMI	Amalie!

AMALIE	Hey!

AMALIE	You're gonna take down your whole office over a bug.

DEMI	You're right. 

DEMI	And how dare you come into town and not come see me before now?

AMALIE	Ok, so I see your network of spies and informants is still going strong.

DEMI	Excuse me! Concerned and observant citizens.

DEMI	And how could they not notice when that big celebrity comes into town?

AMALIE	You could have come to see me.

DEMI	I wish! I have been slammed! My co-editor retired in November

DEMI	Rick is taking the kids to his parents house for an early Christmas.

DEMI	I won't even get to see them until Christmas Eve.

AMALIE	That is cutting it short. 

DEMI	But enough about me.

DEMI	Tell me about you. How’s the writing? How’s is the...love life?

AMALIE	That's actually why I'm here.

DEMI	Your writing or you love life?

AMALIE	Both. You know, my boyfriend Bruce...We broke up.

DEMI	Oh, I am so sorry.

AMALIE	Thanks.

DEMI	Did he propose?

AMALIE	Ok, there's no way your spies would have known that!

DEMI	Oh, they didn't need to tell me.

DEMI	Same old Amalie. You make all the guys fall in love with you and then the moment they get serious, you turn and, pshh run like the wind.AMALIE	I don't do that!

DEMI	How many ex-boyfriends broke up with you first?

AMALIE	There's been a few!

DEMI	Name names.

AMALIE	Ok, there was umm…

AMALIE	ok, no, that was me...umm…

AMALIE	there was umm. Yeah, you know, there's what's his name…

AMALIE	Oh…ok, alright, maybe that was me too. I can't remember.	

AMALIE	Aw, that's so cute. Is that

DEMI	Don't even think about changing the subject

AMALIE	Yeah, well, I can't think of anyone else, but there's more. 

AMALIE	Anyways, I think I may have been wrong about one of them, because I just got this super romantic love letter in a Christmas card.

DEMI	Uh oh.

AMALIE	But it was unsigned.

DEMI	Double uh oh.

AMALIE	Right. But it came from here so I know it came from someone in Helen.

AMALIE	I drew up a list of suspects-

DEMI	Ohh. And, who is your prime suspect?

AMALIE	Joseph Harrington.

AMALIE	I know it was like keleventh grade and he was really skinny and weird. But he was always so super sweet-

DEMI	Have you seen Joseph Harrington lately?

AMALIE	No, why?

AMALIE	Do you know where to find him?

AMALIE	What makes you say that?

AMALIE	Oh, come on, I would never do that! I would never do that.

DEMI	There he is.

AMALIE	That’s Joseph Harrington? 

AMALIE	He’s got arms!

AMALIE	And shoulders!

DEMI	You should see his

AMALIE	Demi!

DEMI	Everything.

AMALIE	You are a married woman.

DEMI	I still have eyes! Eventhough I am partial to my own Rick’s

AMALIE	Ok, calm down. Tell me what you know about him now.

DEMI	Well, he ran track and field in college, which is where he got his... everything.

DEMI	And he volunteers here as a practice opponent for the high school chess club most afternoons.

AMALIE	That's so sweet. 

AMALIE	Yes…

AMALIE	I think he could definitely be the one.

DEMI	The one who wrote the letter?

DEMI	You don’t mean “the one” the one, right?

AMALIE	Wish me luck.

DEMI	Ok, I'm just gonna go back to work. 

DEMI	You go get ‘im...girl!

AMALIE	Joseph? Hi.

JOSEPH	Hey.

JOSEPH	Amalie, hey!

AMALIE	Hey. 

AMALIE	Ahh, I'm so glad to see you!

JOSEPH	Okay.

AMALIE	It's been such a long time! 

JOSEPH	Hey, um, can you give us a second? Thanks. 

JOSEPH	Have a seat.

AMALIE	Wow. You look...great. Like, really great.

JOSEPH	You look really nice, too.

AMALIE	Thanks.

JOSEPH	So, are you back in town for the holiday?

AMALIE	Yes. 

AMALIE	Well that and umm... a certain letter brought me back...

WAITRESS	Hi. 

WAITRESS	What can I get you?

AMALIE	Oh... I’ll have a hot cocoa, please

WAITRESS	How would you like that?

AMALIE	Oh, I forgot about the 99 loco cocoa mixes.

JOSEPH	She’ll have peppermint and allspice. I’ll have one, too, thanks.

JOSEPH	I do remember we liked our cocoa the same way.

AMALIE	You never forget your high school sweetheart, right? It’s so romantic.

JOSEPH	Yeah, I also remembered you liked to play chess.

JOSEPH	You can go first.

AMALIE	I’ve been thinking a lot about the old days, too.

JOSEPH	High school was a long time ago.

JOSEPH	What?

AMALIE	Joseph, I know it was you who wrote that letter.

JOSEPH	What letter?

AMALIE	Come on, the letter in the Christmas card.You know, the one about how much you missed my face and how I made you a better man

AMALIE	How you wanted to hold my hand.

JOSEPH	Amalie, it’s…it's nice to see you, but I have no idea what you’re talking about.

AMALIE	Come on, the letter in the Chris I got it. The love letter.

JOSEPH	I don't know

DOTTIE	Joe?!

JOSEPH	Oh, Dottie!

DOTTIE	What is going on here?!

JOSEPH	You’re here!

DOTTIE	Should I be?

JOSEPH	Yes, of course you should be here!

JOSEPH	Amalie, this is…this is Dotty Dorothy O’Conner. My fi my fiancée.

AMALIE	Your your fiancée?! 

AMALIE	But what about the letter you wrote me!

DOTTIE	Yes, Joe. What about the letter you sent her?

JOSEPH	Ok, um, Amalie, it’s great to see you, 

JOSEPH	but I didn’t write you any letter, signed or unsigned.

AMALIE	Oh, wow, I am so sorry, Dottie. I um

DOTTIE	Maybe you should get your facts straight before you try holding hands with someone else’s fiancée!

AMALIE	Great advice, yes. You are right. I am very...about that. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

DOTTIE	Joe!

JOSEPH	Sorry.

DOTTIE	Now!

JOSEPH	Okay.

JOSEPH	Excuse me.

WAITRESS	Here you go, hun.

AMALIE	Thanks. I'll just take the check whenever you have a second.

AMALIE	Demi!

AMALIE	Why didn’t you tell me Joseph was engaged!?

DEMI	I didn’t know!

AMALIE	You literally just published their wedding announcement!

DEMI	Oh...wow. Sorry... 

DEMI	I am…

DEMI	I am so sorry Amalie.Things have been so crazy since Pat retired last month. I haven't even been able to brush my teeth the entire week.

AMALIE	Ew...

AMALIE	Wait, you’re trying to do all of this by yourself? That's crazy. You need a gal Friday.

AMALIE	And luckily I know just the gal for the job.

AMALIE	What do you got for me boss?

DEMI	What about your own column?

AMALIE	The idea is still ... percolating. So until then, I’m all yours, kid. Come on, whadda got fer me? Breakin’ open a big murder case? Chasin’ down fire trucks? Corruption at City Hall? Lay it on me. I can handle any story you got, big or small.

DEMI	Oh, gingerbread house competition at the senior center.

AMALIE	Ohh, I'm all over it boss!

DEMI	Bless you, Amalie Hess!

AMALIE	Brush your teeth!

DEMI	Ew...smells like feet.

RAY	Hey!

AMALIE	Dad. This place looks amazing.

RAY	Doesn't it look great, huh?

AMALIE	Where’s Mrs. Crabtree?

RAY	Well, she wasn’t feeling up to it today.

AMALIE	Oh, I’m sorry. Is she sick?

RAY	No. No, she just didn't want to be around people.

AMALIE	Oh, that’s too bad.

RAY	Yeah, especially since just plain human contact would be so beneficial for her. 

RAY	What brings you here?

AMALIE	Demi asked me to cover the contest.

RAY	Oh, that’s great! We need all the publicity we can get.

MARTY	Amalie!

AMALIE	Hi!

MARTY	Are you here for the competition? Do you wanna be on our team?

AMALIE	Aw, I would. But I’m reporting for the Helen Herald. The objectivity of the press must be upheld... even in the face of gingerbread.

MARTY	Aw, too bad.

AMALIE	But, maybe you can offer me some insight. Miss McCalister, what is your strategy going into the competition?

MARTY	Well, we’ll be using marshmallow snowdrifts to reinforce the gingerbread walls. A good house always starts with a strong foundation. That’s what my dad always says.

AMALIE	Wow, I didn’t know your engineering skills branched all the way to construction.

MARTY	Oh, yeah! Back when I was little kid, my dad made me this amazing doll house with eight rooms, a big yard and lights that really worked!

AMALIE	That is impressive.

RAY	Alright, everybody. It's time to take your places! Tiwhoop there you go!

RAY	Ok, now when I say go, you have exactly one hour to build a gingerbread house from only the materials provided. Are you ready?

RAY	Set.

RAY	Go!

RAY	Alright, alright, everybody. It's time to get your suff together. Let's go. This is it. 5...4...3...2...1. Ok, stop, drop everything. There you go. Hey, this has been the best gingerbread house contest we’ve had in a long time. 

RAY	But the winners are…

RAY	Mr. Wellington and Marty and Ian McCallister! Way to go, Marty! Good Job. Good job, Marty, Good job.

RAY	Okay.

AMALIE	Everybody say “gingerbread”!

EVERYBODY	(ALL TOGETHER) Gingerbread!

AMALIE	That's great.

RAY	Good Job.

MARTY	Thank you.

RAY	Nice Job.

IAN	I appreciate it.

MARTY	Good job.

IAN	Thank you.

MARTY	Thank you.

MARTY	Thank you.

IAN	Alright, guys. I'll be right back.

MARTY	Ok.

IAN	Hey! Get some good shots?

AMALIE	I did. 

AMALIE	Congrats!  I was hoping you guys would win. The peppermint walkway was inspired!

IAN	That was all Marty. She’s the visionary. I’m just the contractor.

IAN	Are you looking for Will Rivers, still? I went by the general store and apparently he took over the whole place, so…he should be there.  

AMALIE	Great! 

AMALIE	Well. 

AMALIE	How did he look?

IAN	Like Will. (CHUCKLE) I don't know. Maybe a little different.

AMALIE	That’s um…that's not a bad thing! Would you maybe wanna come with me to the general store real quick?

AMALIE	I won't be long. And I just have to finish this write up for Demi.

IAN	I guess so, yeah, as long as your dad doesn’t mind looking after Marty.

AMALIE	Great! I’m sure he won’t.

AMALIE	Hey, dad, can I use your office real quick?

RAY	Of course.

AMALIE	It'll only just be like 3 minutes.

RAY	Is she going to call Bruce?

IAN	Who’s Bruce?

RAY	Her fiance.

WILL	So I was just coming back from the lake with these three big beautiful bass in my bucket when the game warden stops me.

CUSTOMER	You talking about (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

WILL	You know it.

WILL	Which is a problem because I left my fishing license at home that day.

IAN	I thought you wanted to catch up with him?

AMALIE	Yeah, I do... I just... Haven't seen him in a while, and, um...I wanna see something. 

WILL	“No, mam,” I said. “I didn’t catch those fish.

WILL	Those are my pet fish. Every night I let them out to swim around in the lake and in the morning I whistle and they come jumping back in the bucket.”

AMALIE	Is he married?

IAN	He wasn’t wearing a ring.

AMALIE	You looked?

IAN	Yeah, 'cause you asked…

WILL	The game warden says to me, “Sir, I don’t believe you for a moment.”

WILL	I said, “Here, let me show you.” So, I dumped the fish back out in the lake. And a few minutes later the game warden says, “Well, aren’t you going to whistle for your fish?”

AMALIE	Oh... I remember that smile...

WILL	And I said…

WILL	“What fish?”

WILL	(DONKEY LAUGH)

WILL	AMALIE HESS!

AMALIE	Hey.

WILL	Oh, I think I've got a bite.

AMALIE	Oh, no, we don’t have to do that

WILL	Oh, come on, you always loved this!

AMALIE	Ohhh…

WILL	Oh yeah, this is going to be a good one!

WILL	(PLAYFUL GRUNTING)

AMALIE	Okay.

WILL	Oh, she’s a fighter! 

WILL	Get on over here.

AMALIE	Hi, Will. You remember Ian McCallister…

IAN	Will, nice to see you.

WILL	You’re looking good.

AMALIE	Well, thank you. You’re looking…nice, too.

IAN	Well, I'm gonna leave you two, to get...acquainted. I will see you later.	

IAN	Will.

AMALIE	You’re leaving?

IAN	Yeah, I gotta check on Marty.

AMALIE	I’ll see you later at Dad’s, though, right?

IAN	Take. Your. Time.

WILL	Well, well, well, if it's not the one who got away.

AMALIE	How are things? Ian tells me that you’re running this place now. That's great! 

AMALIE	Do you have a partner…or girlfriend...?

WILL	Nope, no one’s caught me just yet.

WILL	Guess I’m still waiting for the right bait…

WILL	You know, I always knew someday you’d come swimming back into my life.

WILL	And here you are, ready to jump back into my boat!

AMALIE	Oh, I'm actually in town for the holiday... and working on a column... It’s about... ex-boyfriends and... second chances.

AMALIE	You don’t believe in second chances, do you?

WILL	I do when you’re standing right in front of me.

WILL	You know, I always said, any fin is possible...

WILL	Just don’t...trout yourself.

WILL	(DONKEY LAUGH)

AMALIE	There's also this angle about love letters. Unsigned love letters.

AMALIE	You don't know anything about those, do you?

WILL	Hey, if I'm gonna drop you a line, you're gonna know it. Get it? Drop you a line, like a fishing line…or drop you a line like a letter

WILL	(DONKEY LAUGH)

WILL	Hey, what are you doing tonight?

WILL	Why don’t you come over for dinner?

WILL	I’ll make you laugh, like the old days…and uh…show you my aquarium…	

AMALIE	Ok, Will, I’m just going to be straight up with you.

AMALIE	Did you write me a love letter and put it in a Christmas card, talking about how much you missed my face and how you wanna hold my hand and…

AMALIE	how that last Christmas we spent together was the best Christmas you ever had?

WILL	We spent a Christmas together?

AMALIE	Yeah. Junior year of college.

AMALIE	Junior year of college.

WILL	If you say so, but I’m sure it was dolphinately a Christmas tuna remember.

WILL	(DONKEY LAUGH)

AMALIE	Okay, well, great. It was great seeing you again. Um, have a very merry Christmas. 

WILL	So that’s a no on the aquarium?

AMALIE	Bye, Will.

SANDER	Hey…

SANDER	Wasn’t that Amalie Hess?

WILL	Yeah.

WILL	That’s the second time she's left me on the hook.

WILL	(DONKEY LAUGH)

AMALIE	Hello…

KAREN	Amalie, it’s Karen. Remember me? Your editor?

AMALIE	Hi, Yeah. Merry Christmas…almost.

KAREN	Oh, I'm glad you remember it’s almost Christmas. Do you also remember it’s almost your deadline? Two days, Amalie. I don’t want to run another column but if you don't give me a choice…

AMALIE	No, no, I…um..I'm working on it now, actually 

KAREN	How’s it going?

AMALIE	It's almost done. Just ironing out some kinks…Umm…

AMALIE	I’ll email you when it’s done! Okay?

AMALIE	Tell the kids I said Merry Christmas!

AMALIE	What was I thinking!

AMALIE	Ian!

IAN	Hey, your dad said you’d be out here. He wanted me to come get you.

AMALIE	Oh, I completely lost track of time.

AMALIE	What was I thinking dating someone like Will?!

AMALIE	I don’t even like fish!

IAN	Or eggplant.

AMALIE	Or eggplant! How do you remember that?

AMALIE	How do you remember that?

IAN	I know a lot about you. I remember you don’t like eggplant, fish, spiders, grapefruit juice, scary movies…should I keep going?

AMALIE	Well, I remember you don’t like bananas, water chestnuts or lamb chops!

AMALIE	And...I also remember...you don’t like it when I do this!

IAN	Wait a minute! Yeah, because you can't start a snowball fight without having established the rules... first.

AMALIE	Um…I should uh…get writing.

IAN	Right. Of course.

AMALIE	I left my column to the last minute, uh..

IAN	Yeah.

AMALIE	It's due in like two days, so…I should probably go work on that.

IAN	Good luck.

AMALIE	So…

AMALIE	Any update on the Center?

RAY	What do you mean?

AMALIE	Dad, I saw the bills when I went into your office.

RAY	If we don’t get our funding - I’m gonna have to start laying people off and cutting serices.

AMALIE	Why?

AMALIE	I thought you had more than enough between the City and all the...fundraising events.

RAY	Yeah. Usually, yes.

RAY	But all the rest of it comes hat in hand and we just haven’t had any donations this year.

AMALIE	So, what are you going to do?

RAY	Well, there’s talk about raising membership fees- Hey now, don’t worry. I know how little our seniors have for spending on extras.

RAY	How is your... column comming?

AMALIE	It’s not!

AMALIE	And I have only two days to turn something into my editor before I lose my spot in the Christmas edition!

RAY	Eh, you'll be fine. You’ll come up with something.

RAY	So, um…

RAY	looks like Ian McCallister has turned into a pretty good dad.	

AMALIE	Yeah.

AMALIE	It's no big surprise.

AMALIE	He was always looking after the younger kids in school.

AMALIE	Helping them or...making sure they didn’t get bullied.

RAY	How come you two never dated?

AMALIE 	Date Ian?! Dad, we were best friends!

RAY	Friends date.

AMALIE	Not unless they want to ruin their friendship.

RAY	Or sweeten it up…

AMALIE	Ok, well ... maybe ... but…

AMALIE	he never asked. And it’s too late now.

AMALIE	And it’s too late now.

RAY	What do you mean it's too late now.

AMALIE	Because he’s married.

RAY	His wife died a year ago. You didn't know that?

AMALIE	No!

AMALIE	Marty said her mom was

AMALIE	with her grandparents. Poor kid. Poor Ian.

AMALIE	Poor kid. Poor Ian.

AMALIE	Poor Ian.

RAY	Here. That's for you.

AMALIE	That’s weird.

AMALIE	It’s not stamped.

RAY	Well, they must have just slipped it into the mailbox.

AMALIE	Dear Amalie, I see you’re back in town. Please come to the hay ride tomorrow and let's celebrate this Christmas together.

RAY	Who's it from?

AMALIE	No signature again.

RAY	What are you going to do?

AMALIE	I'm gonna go.

RAY	No…really?

AMALIE	Yeah!

MARTY	There's Amalie! Amalie!

IAN	Oh, we'll be right back.

MARTY	Hi. 

MARTY	Hi Amalie!

AMALIE	Hi.

MARTY	Are you here for the hay ride, too?

AMALIE	That’s right.

MARTY	Will you ride with us?

AMALIE	Actually, I’m meeting someone.

IAN	Oh, nice. Who?

AMALIE	Well... I don’t know.

IAN	Really…? What do you mean?

AMALIE	Ok, so I’m here because I got this...card.

AMALIE	This unsigned Christmas Card, and…

AMALIE	I know it sounds crazy, but the writer said he wished I was here and that he wishes he could hold my hand again and that the Christmas we spent together was

SANDER	 Was the best Christmas of my life.

AMALIE	Sander Monk?!

SANDER	Hello, Amalie.

AMALIE	Hi. 

SANDER	Thank you for coming.

AMALIE	Thank you for inviting me.

AMALIE	And for finally revealing yourself.

SANDER	Yeah, I figured it was about time.

AMALIE	They probably want to get started.

SANDER	I actually reserved this one just for us.

MARTY	But, Amalie, what about

IAN	Marty, come one, let's go.

MARTY	But Dad!

IAN	Look.

SANDER	You alright?

AMALIE	Yeah.

MARTY		But Dad!

IAN	Hey, you and I, we need to have a little talk.

SANDER	And…

SANDER	I got us a blanket.

AMALIE	You really thought of everything.

SANDER	Mhmm.

AMALIE	Thanks.

AMALIE		Yeah.

SANDER	So, you warm enough?

AMALIE	Oh, yes.

AMALIE	What?

SANDER	I was hoping you would say no.

AMALIE	Why?

SANDER	So I could do this.

SANDER	What?

AMALIE	It’s just...you were never this romantic when we were dating in college.

SANDER	Maybe I read a newspaper column or two that made me realize some women like a little romance.

AMALIE	Sounds like a very informative column.

SANDER	Yeah.

SANDER	And by a very pretty writer.

SANDER	Honestly, I didn’t think you wanted all this mushy stuff back when we were dating. You never said anything about it. But, you know...

SANDER	People can change.

AMALIE	I guess they can.

SANDER	You want some cocoa?

AMALIE	Yes. Please.

SANDER	Alright.

SANDER	Made especially for you.

AMALIE	Thank you.

SANDER	You're welcome.

AMALIE	(COUGHING)

AMALIE	That is some... adult cocoa.

SANDER	Yeah, I remembered we liked it the exact same way.

SANDER	With a kick. Drink up. There’s lots more.

AMALIE	Great.

SANDER	So, you still into hockey?

AMALIE	Yeah.Sure.

SANDER	What’d you think of Friday night’s game?

AMALIE	Uh…

AMALIE	You know, I'm still processing the game. Wha what did you think of it?

SANDER	Defense on both sides was pretty lame, if you ask me. I mean, six to eight final score? There’s just no excuse. Plus the coach - his power play... just downright embarrassing. Not to mention the short-handed play...I mean it's just seemed ridiculous that they just kept scoring back and forth and just... I don't know, it's just

AMALIE	Right.

SANDER	I...you know...I don't know.

RAY	Ok, let's see if that works.

AMALIE	I didn’t know mom was on here.

RAY	Yeah. Holly loved Lucy.

RAY	She would have been so proud of you.

AMALIE	Thanks, Dad.

AMALIE	How did you know she was the one?

RAY	Being with your mom was... well, like...being home.

RAY	It was easy as…easy as breathing and as natural as smiling…	

RAY	Honey, have you...talked to Bruce?

AMALIE	Yeah.

RAY	And

AMALIE	Oh...it's past my bedtime.

AMALIE	I should get going.

RAY	Okay.

AMALIE	Good night.

RAY	Sleep tight.

AMALIE	You too. 

BRUCE	Hay.

BRUCE	Had to be hay.

BRUCE	(CLEARS THROAT)

DEMI	Yes, sir. I am…happy that you found your missing bacon.Yes, yes, yes, yes. Please tell you wife that I said hi and to enjoy her bacon.

DEMI	Okay.

DEMI	Amelie! Ohh, you know what...such a great job covering the gingerbread contest, it’s going on the front page.

AMALIE	Thank you! I forgot how much fun regular reporting can be. I’ll be your Gal Friday any day of the week.

DEMI	Really? What about your column?

AMALIE	Well, by this time tomorrow that’s all going to be squared away.

DEMI	Oohh, something tells me that smile on your face is not just from the joys of journalism. 

DEMI	Wait, where did that rose come from?

DEMI	Did you figure out who your mystery writer is?!

AMALIE	It’s Sander Monk.

DEMI	Sander Monk?

DEMI	You mean Sander Not-A-Monk, the biggest liar in White County?	

AMALIE	He's not like that anymore.

DEMI	Do you not remember why you broke up with him?

AMALIE	Would the old Sander write that beautiful love letter or plan that romantic carriage ride?

AMALIE	That was the most romantic thing that's ever happened to me. I think it's a sign.

DEMI	Well... If you’re happy...

AMALIE	I am.

DEMI	Then I'm happy too.

AMALIE	Thank you.

DEMI	Oh, can you cover the Christmas party at the senior center for me?	

AMALIE	Yeah! I’ll be there anyway.

DEMI	Yes!

AMALIE	Oh, I gotta go.

AMALIE	I told Sander I was just going home to change before the hockey game.

AMALIE	I’ll have that Christmas party write up for you on your desk day after tomorrow.

DEMI	But Amalie, you don't even like hoc

DEMI	I can't help that girl

DEMI	Oh, somebody remembered that they actually hate hockey.

DEMI	Ian!

IAN	Hey.

DEMI	Hi. I I'm sorry, I thought you were Amalie.

IAN	Well that's what I came to talk to you about. You got a sec?	

DEMI	For you, two seconds.

IAN	Thanks.

IAN	Amalie told you about the anonymous letter she got, right?	

DEMI	Yes.

IAN	Yeah, well, uh…

IAN	I know who sent it.

DEMI	Sander Monk.

IAN	No. He’s lying.

DEMI	How do you know that?

DEMI	Wha You?

IAN	Yeah.

DEMI	You?

DEMI	You sent Amalie the anonymous Christmas love letter?

IAN	I I wrote it, but I didn’t send it.

IAN	My my daughter Marty looked up Amalie’s publisher’s address and sent it without me even knowing.

DEMI	Oh, oh wow.

IAN	Yeah, it turns out there are down sides to having a daughter who's practically a genious.

DEMI	Maybe.

DEMI	But not in this case!

IAN	Demi! She's got a fiance!

DEMI	No! She doesn't. He messed up the proposal and so she broke up with him. This…

DEMI	...is your chance.

DEMI	Ian, you have been in love with Amalie since High School, but you never said anything.

IAN	She always had a boyfriend.

IAN	She never looked at me like that.

DEMI	See, these are the same lame excuses you used in high school. When are you ever going to speak up?

IAN	I’m just not ready.

DEMI	Boy! You better get ready!

DEMI	Christmas is a time for second chances.

IAN	You know what? You're right.

IAN	You're right, thank you!

DEMI	Welcome! Welcome.

DEMI	Queen Demi does it again.

IAN	Alright. Pliers, Mr. Hess.

IAN	Thank you.

IAN	Try it now.

RAY	Eh, that’s not right.

IAN	Nope.

RAY	No

IAN	No. Ok, how about now?

IAN	Okay, Holly. Be a good doggie robot.

HOLLY	(BARKING)

RAY	That’s it! That’s exactly right!

HOLLY	(BARKING)

RAY	Aw... That’s a noise that'll crack open anybody's heart. I could do this all night long.

MARTY	Me too.

AMALIE	Hello?

HOLLY	(BARKING)

RAY	We’re in here!

AMALIE	Aw, I missed a Holly day!

AMALIE	Oh, Sander, you gotta meet this dog.

AMALIE	She is a robotic companion dog. She looks, acts and feels just like a real dog. She's amazing.

AMALIE	Go ahead and pet her.

AMALIE	Alright. 

HOLLY	(BARKING)

IAN	Still working out the bugs

AMALIE	You ok…?

MARTY	It’s not a bug. It’s a feature.

RAY	Yeah, we’re planing of introducing her to the public at the Senior Center's Christmas party tomorrow. I know a lot of seniors that would love to see a dog at Christmas.

AMALIE	That's a great idea. Demi wanted me to cover the party for the paper.

SANDER	Oh! No, uh, I’ve got tickets to the Metal Shredders at the Stumble Inn tomorrow. I thought we’d go.

AMALIE	But I promised Demi.

SANDER	I mean I thought we'd drive around after.

SANDER	Look at the Christmas lights? It's pretty romatic...right?

AMALIE	It's very romantic.

AMALIE	Um…ok, I can talk to Demi and maybe she'll cover the senior center and I'll cover the concert.

SANDER	Sweet.

MARTY	Aw... you’re not coming to the party? Not even for Holly?

MARTY	(PUPPY WHIMPER)

RAY	That's too bad, but I’m sure it'll all work out.

IAN	Yeah, well, it's getting late. I guess we should get home for dinner, Marty, huh?

RAY	Great job, Ian.

IAN	Thank you for your help.

RAY	They'll love you at the party tomorrow.

IAN	Good night, Sander. 

IAN	Night, Amalie.

AMALIE	Just give me a minute. I’ll be right back.

AMALIE	Ian!

AMALIE	There's more than enough food for you and Marty. You guys can stay for dinner.

IAN	No, thank you. We appreciate it. But we should get going.

AMALIE	Ok

IAN	Oh…you...a…

IAN	You guys left your cocoa. Wow

IAN	Wow

AMALIE	It's not mine. Well, it is but it's how Sander likes it.

AMALIE	It's adult cocoa.

IAN	How do you like your cocoa?

AMALIE	I don’t know. Isn’t that funny?

IAN	Not really.

AMALIE	Okay…

AMALIE	Why are you rushing off? Something wrong?

IAN	Honesly, I just don't want to stand here and watch you do this again.

AMALIE	Do what?

IAN	Twist yourself into somebody else so that you can become some guy’s “perfect girlfriend”.

AMALIE	I’m not doing that... much less doing it “again”.

IAN	Come on, the “Adult” cocoa? Hockey jersey? The Metal Shredders?

AMALIE	Couples take part in each other’s interests, Ian.

IAN	Yeah. Yeah, of course they do. I mean, I went yard sale-ing with my wife on Saturdays because she loved it and I was happy to do it. But she would go hiking with me on Sundays. You know, it's gotta go both ways.

IAN	I mean, do you even know what your interests are?

IAN	What you want to pursue?

IAN	You don’t even know how you like your cocoa.

IAN	You got everything? Gloves, jacket, hat, scarf?

MARTY	Gloves! Jacket! Hat! Scarf!

IAN	Alright!

IAN	Say bye.

MARTY	Bye, Amalie!

AMALIE	Bye, Marty.

AMALIE	Good night, Ian. 

RAY	So you and Sebastian, huh? 

AMALIE	Sander, Dad.

RAY	What about Bruce?

AMALIE	Bruce and I…

AMALIE	we broke up.

RAY	Well, you could have told me.

AMALIE	I know. I guess I just felt stupid because of how sure I thought I was about him.

RAY	Well, I thought you were sure about him too. Hey, there's no reason to rush.	

AMALIE	Oh, but I love the rush!

AMALIE	I love getting to know someone new. I love wanting to know everything about them. I love lying awake, wondering if they’re thinking about me, too. I just love the-

RAY	Love?

AMALIE	Yeah... I guess I do.

AMALIE	Hey, Dad, do you think that I... change myself?

AMALIE	...for my boyfriends, I mean? Ian said that I... twist myself around to become the “perfect girlfriend”. Is that true?

RAY	Well, you..you've always been extremely open to new 

ideas.

AMALIE	Oh! So, I’m a pretzel! I'm just a pretzel who twists herself into knots to make some guy love me!

RAY	That’s not what I said all! No one needs more reasons to love you. You are the most lovable person I know.

AMALIE	Thanks, Dad.

RAY	But I will say this... I know you like the time you spend with your boyfriends. But you've always seemed the happiest when you're just hanging out with Ian and Demi. Seemed like you never felt the pressure to be anyone else when you were with them.

AMALIE	Alright, I got another question for you.

RAY	What's that?

AMALIE	Do you remember how I used to like my hot cocoa?

RAY	I have no idea.

AMALIE	That’s what I was afraid of.

AMALIE	Marty! Sit down.

MARTY	Hello, Amalie. What did you call me for today?

AMALIE	I really need your help with a special science project.

MARTY	A science project in the cafe? Why?

AMALIE	I need to figure out how I really like my cocoa.

MARTY	Oh my goodness, you don’t know?

AMALIE	I’ve gotten a bit confused.

AMALIE	So I’m gonna try them all.

MARTY	But there are 99 different kinds!

AMALIE	I've drawn up a lista and I’ve crossed out the ones I know I don’t like

AMALIE	We only have 76 left. Can you help?

MARTY	Of course, I can. Bring on the cocoa! For science!

WAITRESS	What would you like?

MARTY	Um, we'll try 76 flavors.

WAITRESS	All of them?

MARTY	Yes.

MARTY	Okay, Amalie.

MARTY	It’s down to these three.

MARTY	What shall it be?

AMALIE	I’m pretty sure it’s not this one.

MARTY	Ok.

AMALIE	It's this one or it's this one.

MARTY	Is that a yum, yum, yum?

AMALIE	It's pretty good.

AMALIE	Ok, this is the one! This is my favorite way to have cocoa…absolutely. What is it?

MARTY	It’s classic cocoa with three marshmallows.

AMALIE	Hey!

MARTY	Yey!

MARTY	Good job for bringing all of them.

AMALIE	Thank you for all your help. 

MARTY	You're welcome.

AMALIE	Sander! Over here!

SANDER	These are for you.

AMALIE	Thank you!

AMALIE	So thoughtful.

MARTY	So…

MARTY	You’re the one who wrote her that letter? That love letter?

SANDER	That’s right.

MARTY	But... if you hadn’t seen her in a very long time, how did you know where she lived?

SANDER	Well, so, there’s this big thing called the internet

MARTY	I know about the internet. I’m not two years old, Mister.

SANDER	Ok. Yeah. Um…so I looked up Amalie and I found the address to her apartment.

MARTY	Wait. Her apartment’s address?

SANDER	Yes.

MARTY	That's very…smart…right, Amalie?

AMALIE	Marty, what are you?

MARTY	Oh, my Dad's here. I have to go. See you later, Amalie.

AMALIE	See ya. 

MARTY	Bye.

IAN	You have fun with Amalie?

SANDER	That's a weird kid, huh.

AMALIE	Ah, so, what do you mean when you said you looked up my apartment address online?

AMALIE	My home address is unlisted.

SANDER	It's got to be on there somewhere, since I got it to send the letter. Right? You just need one of those privacy firms to do their thing.

AMALIE	Except the letter didn’t go to my apartment. It went to my office, at the paper.

AMALIE	You didn’t send the letter at all, did you?

SANDER	Amalie...

AMALIE	Why did you tell me you wrote it when you didn’t?

SANDER	I overheard you telling Will about it in the store the other day. And I was like, man…I wish I had done that, 'cause I've really have missed you, Amalie.

AMALIE	You lied to me. Again!

SANDER	Yeah, but was the only thing, I swear. Look, look. And you've not been that completely honest, either.

AMALIE	I have so!

SANDER	I can tell you don’t actually know a goal crease from a penalty box. But you just kept nodding and acting like you knew what I was talking about!

AMALIE	Ok, fine I guess we're both liars.

SANDER	Fine!

AMALIE	Fine!

SANDER	Fine!

AMALIE	Fine!

SANDER	Fine!

AMALIE	Fine!

SANDER	Fine!

AMALIE	Fine!

AMALIE	You have to be the one to walk away. This is my table.

SANDER	Fine!

WILL	Well, we've got the candles and the outdoor bluetooth speakers, that's not a problem. But I gotta ask…

WILL	What do you need fifteen bales of hay for?

BRUCE	I need them to get my girlfriend back.

AMALIE	Merry Christmas, Mrs. Crabtree. What are you doing way over here? Let’s get you closer to the festivities

MRS. CRABTREE	Don’t you touch my chair! I don’t want to be any closer!

MRS. CRABTREE	This is a terrible party!

AMALIE	It looks like a nice party to me.

MRS. CRABTREE	They used to be better parties.

MRS. CRABTREE	When your father’s other girl would come.

AMALIE	Mrs. Crabtree, My father doesn't have another daughter. Holly was his dog. Don’t you remember?

MRS. CRABTREE	I remember! I never said she was a daughter, did I? Nobody listens. Nobody cares.

AMALIE	I care.

AMALIE	My dad cares.

AMALIE	Can I get you anything?

MRS. CRABTREE	No.

MRS. CRABTREE	Just Just go on with you now! Get Get away from me!

DEMI	Amalie!

DEMI	What are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be at a shredded wheat concert or something.

AMALIE	Well...

DEMI	Mmm…was Sander Monk Not-A-Monk, again?

AMALIE	No, but he's not my mystery writer either.

DEMI	Sorry. Not sorry.

AMALIE	You were right…as usual.

DEMI	Yeap. So, what are you going to do for your column?

AMALIE	I got nothing. No great love story. No big reveal of my mystery writer. No column about the power of second chances during Christmas.

AMALIE	I'm gonna have to call my editor and have her get someone else to fill my space. My readers are going to be so disappointed.

DEMI	Sweetheart, I’m sorry.

MARTY	Hi Santa!

DEMI	What’s this?

AMALIE	It’s a surprise! 

RAY	Hey, hey, hey everybody!

AMALIE	It's pretty brilliant.

RAY	Thank you so very much for coming to our annual Christmas party. First, I’d like to thank all our volunteers. You guys are amazing. This is terriffic! I'd also like to take this time to introduce someone new to the center. We’ve been searching for a new canine friend but there have been a lot of challenges. Luckily, with the help of Ian McCallister and his daughter, Marty, I think we’ve found the perfect solution. Marty, would you like to do the honors?

MARTY	Yes, I will.

MARTY	Everybody, we’d like you to meet Holly. Holly is a robot companion puppy. She looks and acts just like a real dog. And best of all, she never bites, has to go outside, or makes anybody sneeze.

WILL	(DONKEY LAUGH)

MARTY	Well, come on up and meet Holly!

DEMI	Did you know that Ian could pull off something this amazing?

AMALIE	I did! I absolutely did!

RAY	This is going to make a great story for the paper, won't it?

DEMI	It will. I have never seen anything make an entire room of people smile all at once like Holly.

AMALIE	Everyone is smiling, aren’t they?

AMALIE	Well, almost everyone.

RAY	Well... I guess Holly can't do everything.

AMALIE	Just wait.

AMALIE	Do you wanna go show Mrs. Crabtree?

MARTY	Yeah, yeah. 

MARTY	Hi Mrs. Crabtree. Would you like to meet my friend Holly?

MRS. CRABTREE	No. What?! Don No! Just Just get her away from here. You trying to sneeze me into a heart attack?

AMALIE	It’s okay, Mrs. Crabtree. Holly’s not like other dogs. 

MRS. CRABTREE	I know! I know! I heard your father.

AMALIE	No one is allergic to her, I promise.

MRS. CRABTREE	Well, maybe she could come a little closer. But one sneeze or one tickle, you take her right back now, you hear?

MARTY	Would you like to pet her?

MRS. CRABTREE	Oh... Aren’t you a good girl...

AMALIE	Yeah.

EVERBODY	(SINGING DECK THE HALLS) Deck the halls with boughs of holly, Fa la la la la, la la la la. Tis the season to be jolly, Fa la la la la, la la la la. Don we now our gay apparel, Fa la la, la la la, la la la.

EVERBODY	(CHEERS AND LAUGHTER)

AMALIE	Karen. It’s me. Don’t yell just yet.

KAREN	Okay, you have exactly one minute and then I start yelling. Amalie, where is your column?

AMALIE	Ok, so there was a problem... The mystery writer? Still a mystery and I guess it’s going to stay that way because he sure seems like he never wants to be found.

KAREN	I was afraid of that. I’m sorry, but I do have another piece all lined up.

AMALIE	No! But I have a story to write. It’s got a robot.

KAREN	A robot?!

AMALIE	Here, I’ll send you the picture. Easier to explain that way.

KAREN	Amalie, there are two things our readers expect from a Christmas Love Notes column and that’s Christmas and love. I don’t see how-

AMALIE	Please just look.

KAREN	Aw...! Hi.

AMALIE	Right? It’s just a different kind of love.

KAREN	I’ll need it within the hour.

AMALIE	Done!

AMALIE	Whether it comes in the form of a bark or a tail wag - in the end Christmas is about love. Any kind.

AMALIE	All...kinds.


AMALIE	Connections deep and strong that bind us and remind us of the true meaning of the season.... The end.

IAN	Amalie. There you are.

IAN	I was wondering where you went.

AMALIE	Had to step away for a few minutes to write my column. 

IAN	Nice. And…

AMALIE	I think it’s pretty good... only not what I expected it to be…

AMALIE	My mystery love letter...wasn’t from Sander Monk.

IAN	Mm…yeah, I know.

AMALIE	Did Marty tell you?

IAN	Mmm...Something like that.

IAN	(CLEARS THROAT)	

AMALIE	So the party... Holly was a huge success.

IAN	Yeah!

AMALIE	Holly was a huge success.

IAN	Yeah! You know, I finally realized I’d been holding back on showing her to people.

AMALIE	Why? I mean, I get her bark needed a little work, but, I mean, from the beginning she was amazing.

IAN	I think I just wanted to know how someone would react before I showed them something that was such a big part of myself, you know.

AMALIE	How could you doubt that people would love her?

IAN	I don't know.

IAN	I guess I just thought that some people might not recognize a thing they love…

IAN	...even when it's been there the whole time.

AMALIE	Only an idiot would do that.

BRUCE	Amalie?

IAN	Who are you?

BRUCE	I’m Amalie’s fiancé.

BRUCE	I mean...I’d like to be...

AMALIE	Bruce

BRUCE	If you could just give me a second chance.

BRUCE	Because it’s Christmas.

AMALIE	Where are we going?

BRUCE	You’ll see.

IAN	Uh, you..

DEMI	You didn’t tell her, did you?

IAN	I tried! But, no, I didn't. It doesn’t matter anyway. Her fiancée is back.

AMALIE	Bruce!

AMALIE	What did you do?

BRUCE	Oh, just a little nothing, nothing. Here.

BRUCE	Here.

BRUCE	The first time I ever saw you I had this thought. It just popped into my head, and I have no idea where it came from. But it was there she is. The rest of my life - our life - it it just flashed before my eyes. I saw us together. I saw us dating and getting married. I saw us buying a house and having children. I saw us growin old and retiring together.  I knew that my life would never be complete without you.

AMALIE	Bruce.

AMALIE	That was so beautiful and amazing

BRUCE	(BRUCE SNEEZES¨)

BRUCE	(BRUCE SNEEZES AGAIN¨)

BRUCE	(BRUCE SNEEZES AGAIN¨)

AMALIE	It’s the hay, isn’t it?

BRUCE	Yeah.

AMALIE	Why did you do this if you’re allergic to hay? I mean, why hay at all?

BRUCE	Yeah, I saw it on your Instagram feed.

AMALIE	Oh, That’s where you saw the champagne and...the music.Ok.

AMALIE	Did you...get that speech from one of my columns?

BRUCE	Well, I I didn't mean to steal...it. I just... did it to…give you what you wanted.

AMALIE	It's very sweet... But it’s just not very

BRUCE	(BRUCE SNEEZES¨)

BRUCE	Excuse me. I'm sorry, what were you saying?

AMALIE	It's not really you.

BRUCE	I guess I’m pretty boring.

AMALIE	Well, I'm boring sometimes too. And you should know that I’m not going to be the perfect wife. I’m not even the perfect girlfriend. I actually don’t like going to lectures about population pyramids. Or eggplant. I really, really don't like eggplant.

AMALIE	But I really like hot cocoa with just three marshmallows. And working with my Demi and writing for The Helen’s newspaper. And hanging out with girl geniuses. And robotic dogs.

BRUCE	Eggplant parmesan?

BRUCE	(DRY HEAVING)

BRUCE	With the garlic? That was…

AMALIE	Yeah, that really wasn't my thing…

BRUCE	I feel like I don’t even know you.

AMALIE	I don’t think you do. But it’s not your fault. I pretended to be someone else for you so that everything would be perfect. I didn't think that there could be romance without perfection, so in order to have that I had to pretend.

AMALIE	You're a wonderful guy Is that a...knee pad?

BRUCE	Oh yeah.

AMALIE	Bruce, you're a wonderful guy. And I know you're going to find someone imperfectly perfect. But that someone…she's not me.

BRUCE	I hope you find what you’re looking for.

AMALIE	Thanks.

BRUCE	Just… I mean, if you know…

BRUCE	(DRY HEAVING)

BRUCE	Do you?

AMALIE	I want romance. Grand gestures and small kindnesses 

BRUCE	Yeah, well…. that's not me.

AMALIE	And I want to be myself too. I don't know if that's asking too much but… there you have it.

BRUCE	(BRUCE SNEEZES¨)

AMALIE	You should really get out of here

BRUCE	I guess I better take off.

BRUCE	But, uh…please enjoy the

AMALIE	I'll deal with this. Yeah, don't...worry.

BRUCE	I'll grab a Benadryl.

AMALIE	Yeah, that's a good idea.

BRUCE	(CONTINUOUS DRY HEAVING¨)

AMALIE	Okay.

AMALIE	Dad, I’m home!

RAY	Amalie! Great news! Ian just called. An investor saw your post. He wants to invest in the Holly dogs. Ian’s thrilled. He wants to make a donation to the Senior Center. I think we'll be able to keep it open. It’s saved!

AMALIE	That’s great news.

RAY	Yes!

RAY	Oh, here. This came for you.

AMALIE	Dear Amalie. I’m the one who wrote you the Christmas love letter, who misses your face every day and wants to hold your hand. You still light up my world every time I see you and make me want to be a better man. If you come home and read this and still want to give me a second chance, come and find me... You’ll know where if you just take a moment and think it over.

RAY	Who's it from?

AMALIE	Doesn't say.

AMALIE	Think it over.

AMALIE	Think it over.

AMALIE	I gotta go.

RAY	Ok.

IAN	Dear Amalie.

IAN	I am always thinking of you this time of year, but this year I could not stop wishing I could see you, wishing you were here, wishing I could see your face…

IAN	…wishing I could hold your hands…

IAN	You always light up my life every time that I see you…

IAN	...Just by being you.

IAN	And I hope that you think I’m I'm worthy. I know it's been a really long time since that last Christmas that we spent together. 

AMALIE	Yeah, it was the Christmas before I moved away. I was sad because I was single.

AMALIE	I remember now.

IAN	You remember.

IAN	Look, I know that we haven't explored anything past friendship but it is way past time for me to tell you how I really feel about you. 

AMALIE	Ian! I can’t believe it was you who wrote that beautiful, romantic letter.

AMALIE	I should have known.

AMALIE	I should have know it was you…

AMALIE	It was always you!

IAN	Oh, we have snow?

IAN	Come here, you, get over here.

AMALIE	It's a glitter squirrel!
