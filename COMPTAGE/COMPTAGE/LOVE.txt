MIMI	My name is Mimi…

MIMI	And one thing you can say about my man Stevie…

STEVIE J	What studio do we have lined up?

MIMI	He’s got a smooth tongue. 
STEVIE J	Okay Tree Sound. 

MIMI	I’ve been with him for about fifteen years now and I’m pretty sure I have heard it all. 

STEVIE J	So, so, so what’s the deal?

MIMI	We have a two-year old daughter named Eva and it’s time for him to be the man he tells me he can be. 

STEVIE J	But I’m going to call you back like in twenty minutes.
MIMI	But somehow there’s a difference between what Stevie says and what Stevie does. 

STEVIE J	My name is Stevie J.  I am a musician, a hit songwriter. You know I’m a dad and I’m a good guy. 

STEVIE J	At the end of the day, you know…

MIMI	Stevie has three Grammys.

MIMI	He’s worked with Diddy.

MIMI	Jay-z. 

MIMI	All the top people in the business. 

MIMI	He’s at the studio way more than he is at home and I know what that life is like. Long nights, girls, liquor, lord knows what else. Meanwhile back at the ranch I’m at home taking care of our daughter. Okay, okay talk to me.

STEVIE J	Aight, so, so…

MIMI	Stevie says he has a surprise for me. So he’s got me driving him way outside the city. I don’t like surprises when it comes to Stevie. 

MIMI	I’ve had to deal with his bs for way to long. 

STEVIE J	(Clears throat) See. This is um…

MIMI	This is cute. 

STEVIE J	You know all the ups and downs we’ve been through and I wanted to give you something nice. This is all you right here. 

MIMI	You’re joking, right?

MIMI	Stevie can be the sweetest, nicest, kindest person ever and then on the flip side of it, it can be a BLEEP nightmare. (Laughs)

STEVIE J	At the end of the day you’ve been down for me for a long time. You know I wanted to just give you something for you and Eva so ya’ll a have something to call home.

MIMI	So you want to move us way out here while you’re doing you in the city. 

STEVIE J	I, I still can’t be around like that. Because I need to get out here and get this money. 

MIMI	If it was just money he was getting in the studio I wouldn’t be mad at that. But he’s getting way more than some money. So for him to have in a house way out is real convenient for him. 

STEVIE J	This is for you.

MIMI	Hmph. You keep saying all the wrong BLEEP. You should be saying this is for us, not me. You haven’t said it one time. 

STEVIE J	Do you want it or not. 

MIMI	I want a situation where you can come home at night. 

STEVIE J	I ain’t really trying, that ain’t where I am at with it. 

MIMI	So I’m not understanding what you’re saying, “that’s not where you’re at”? 

STEVIE J	This is, I need to handle things right now. And I just felt that this was the proper thing to do. I really, really, really, really need to know if  this is what you want. If not I got, I need to work something out with the man. 

MIMI	Well how long do you have. 

STEVIE J	I got a couple days. 

MIMI	Alright I’ll let you know in a couple days.

STEVIE J	Tsss. I’m, but I’m sick and tired, I’m sick… I’m sick of trying to be nice.

MIMI	Cause I need, I need to find out where you, I need to…

STEVIE J	You blatantly ungrateful. 

MIMI	I’m not ungrateful Stevie. You need to understand where I am coming from. 

STEVIE J	I love you.

MIMI	I love you to, but…

STEVIE J	Do you love me enough to just stay here and make this work?

MIMI	That means stay here, shut the BLEEP up and be a good dog and let you do what you do. Is that what that means? 

STEVIE J	If you don’t want this you got to let me know asap. 

ERICA	Very good.

ERICA	My name is Erica. I’m a single mother and…I have been dating the rapper Lil Scrappy on and off for about ten years. 

LIL SCRAPPY	Oh. 

IMANI	Reach out.

ERICA	And we have a gorgeous six-year old named Imani. 

LIL SCRAPPY	How you get that thing back in?

LIL SCRAPPY	My name is Lil Scrappy.

LIL SCRAPPY	I’m the prince of the south. Born and raised, probably going to die in the A. Yeah, you know what I’m saying? 

ERICA	When we first met Scrappy wasn’t a household name. 

Wassup. Hey, I get mine and then I do my thing for me. 

ERICA	But in 2006 he me Lil Jon, did his first album. 


ERICA	And things took off from there. 

ERICA	C’mon sweetie. 

ERICA	You know the story, you hold a man down.

ERICA	His career takes off and he’s on to the next chick. 

ERICA	The new girl happened to be an Atlanta rapper named Diamond.

ERICA	The affair was public and it hurt me.

ERICA	But the tables turned when Diamond had a public relationship with Soulja Boy. 

ERICA	And Scrappy came limping home to me. 

ERICA	We are trying to move forward with the relationship. I just don’t know if I am all in the relationship right now.

ERICA	What did I tell you? I said no cheese. 

LIL SCRAPPY	When everything went down my baby momma Erica was the first person I called and told the whole thing to. She said I know you hurting and all that, but you know you got a daughter. She needs you so get it together. 

ERICA	Do you think you’d be here if Diamond hadn’t had her relationship with Soulja Boy? 

LIL SCRAPPY	I always thought about that like dang, you know I didn’t give my little girl a good shot at seeing her momma and daddy together. And you know seeing that family how it’s supposed to be. You know what I’m saying?

ERICA	My question is you. Like how do you really feel? Do you want to move forward? Like you still in this moving forward or…

LIL SCRAPPY	I feel the love, but it ain’t clicking on that end. Like what I be telling you? You not to, you know?

ERICA	Affectionate. 

LIL SCRAPPY	Affectionate. It’s hard to tell sometimes, you feel me? 

ERICA	We’ve been through so much. The cheating and just, just from a woman’s perspective like it’s hard to just, just trust and believe you know, you’re every word, you’re every move. When I first found out about you and Diamond’s relationship do you know how I felt? 

LIL SCRAPPY	You know I kinda, sorta do. 

ERICA	I felt betrayed. 

ERICA	At this point I don’t put anything past Scrappy. He says he wants affection, but he was getting a lot of that before he moved on to Diamond. 

ERICA	And I do want to, you know try and move forward. But I want you to know at the end of the day this is round two. 

LIL SCRAPPY	Yup, this is round two.

ERICA	So it’s all or nothing. 

K. MICHELLE	So why does it feel like I could die. 

K. MICHELLE	Bury my heart. 

K. MICHELLE	My name is K. Michelle. 

K. MICHELLE	(Laughing)

K. MICHELLE	I’m a singer. I’m a single mother, I am a pianist and I rock out with my BLEEP out. 

K. MICHELLE	This song is very important. Like we all been heart broken and you know how ya’ll men do. So… (Laughs)

J. QUE	I’m not going to sit here and let you beat up on me. I feel what you’re saying though. 

K. MICHELLE	We need that break up record. 

K. MICHELLE	I recently got out of a nasty relationship that affected my music career. But now I am on my way back up and I am using my music to tell my story. 

J. CUE	That’s what this whole thing is, is your truth. You have to tell your truth through the song. 

K. MICHELLE	This record is special and I, I can relate to it. 

J. CUE	Let’s get that pain on it. 

K. MICHELLE	Gotcha.
J. CUE	Alright let’s give it another shot. 

K. MICHELLE	They say that all wounds heal over time. So why does it feel like I could die. Bury my heart, bury my heart so I won’t hurt again. 

JOSELINE	I just…

STEVIE J	I believe in you, you know that?

JOSELINE	I know you do. 

STEVIE J	I just see you being a really big international hit. 

MIMI	Oh word? For real?

STEVIE	I’m, I was looking for you.

MIMI	You wasn’t looking for me in the car with her. 

STEVIE J	C’mon. Chill. 

MIMI	Are you BLEEP serious right now?

STEVIE J	Hold on. Wait a minute. 

MIMI	Stevie decided to surprise me with a house today. 

ARIANE	Really?

MIMI	I went to visit my girlfriend Ariane. We’ve known each other seven or eight years. She knows the ups and downs of what I’ve been going through with Stevie and she’s always been there for me. 

ARIANE	Is this a house for all of you? 

MIMI	He kept saying it’s for me and the baby.
ARIANE	So he would keep a place in the city and pretend like he’s working every night and not coming home. What just keeps you hanging on to him? Is it the BLEEP?

MIMI	Girl I’ve never met a BLEEP in my life that made me do cartwheels, ever. 

ARIANE	But why?

MIMI	What is it about Stevie that keeps me with him? When things are good they’re really good. 

MIMI	I’m not.

ARIANE	I just don’t want you to constantly make excuses for him and I feel like sometimes…

MIMI	I’m not doing that.

ARIANE	That’s what you do. 

MIMI	I’m not making excuses, but I do understand that life. 

ARIANE	I feel like sometimes she’s afraid to leave. I want her to get over it because you can. 

ARIANE	But you are still accepting his behavior. You’re accepting all of the things that he does with all of these women. 

MIMI	For the past two years my day to day has been mommy mode. My focus is not been what the BLEEP are you doing? 

ARIANE	You’re a woman with so much potential. It hurts to know that he even can say I’m a still going to do the BLEEP that I’m doing. 

ARIANE	To me I feel like Stevie J doesn’t care about women. Come on this is the mother of your child.

ARIANE	He doesn’t even have a reason to fight for you because you’ve given him everything and that’s not fair. 

MIMI	I know.

MIMI	I believe what he tells me when he tells me he wants his family, he loves me and he loves his daughter. This is what he wants, I believe him.

ARIANE	At this point right now, where do you think he is? 

MIMI	Probably the studio.

STEVIE J	Hey.

JOSELINE	What’s up baby?

STEVIE J	What’s up? 

JOSELINE	What’s going on?

STEVIE J	How are you?

JOSELINE	My name is Joseline Hernandez. I am a rapper, actress, dancer, just an entertainer all the way across the board. 

JOSELINE	You got me working hard baby. 

STEVIE J	You looking amazing.

JOSELINE	You like my shorts? (SIGHS)

STEVIE J	That’s crazy. (CHUCKLES)

JOSELINE	(LAUGHS) What’s up baby?

STEVIE J	We’ve been working together for four months. I believe we have the songs that we need to start getting you out there and showcasing you know the real you. I just see you being like a real international hit. 

STEVIE J	With Joseline for sure I got a winner. With her beauty, her swag, my coaching she’s bound to go to the top. 

JOSELINE	You got me working out like an animal. 

STEVIE J	You never look like that.

JOSELINE	No.

STEVIE J	No. Who did that?

JOSELINE	You did that, but at the same time, you know…

STEVIE J	Who did that? (LAUGHS)

JOSELINE	Daddy you did. (LAUGHS)

JOSELINE	Stevie gave me much more than you’re thinking he just want to BLEEP on me. He just everything to me. But it’s not just about the sex.
JOSELINE	I just…

STEVIE	I believe in you. You know that?

JOSELINE	I know you do. 

STEVIE	If you keep doing what you do nothing can stop you. 

JOSELINE	I don’t want to go back to the club. I’m tired of BLEEP stripping so baby please, please, please, please…

STEVIE	(CHUCKLES)

JOSELINE	Please let’s make this work. Please, please, please. 

JOSELINE	Everybody think she’s a bad bitch. He get all the bitches. It’s not really about Stevie getting in my pants. You know what I am saying? I want Stevie forever. 

STEVIE J	Is you riding with me? Is you down? 

JOSELINE	You know I’m down. 

JOSELINE	It ain’t about BLEEP no sexing. It’s a for everything for Stevie and I. We BLEEP my brains. 

STEVIE J	I wanted to hear what we did last night. You know what I’m saying?

JOSELINE	Okay. 

JOSELINE	Yes.

JOSELINE	Estoy no se siente como ayer. Ya llegue donde tenia que llegar. Oh yea, yea yea. Uh. Tu sabes que estamos primero, tu sabes que yo mando el juego, tu sabes que no estoy pa juego. Asi que…

MOMMA DEE	Who is it?

LIL SCRAPPY	Me.

MOMMA DEE	Wow.

MOMMA DEE	I’m Momma Dee. I’m the mother of the famous rap star Lil Scrappy. I’m the type of mother that is very loving, caring, and sharing, but overprotective. That’s how it is and it’s always going to be that way. And in that order. (FINGER SNAP)
MOMMA DEE	Not really finished with it yet. And the amenities are not even in. 

LIL SCRAPPY	Wow.

MOMMA DEE	And I done gave them a BLEEP stack. I said what ya’ll got crack smokers working for ya’ll? 

LIL SCRAPPY	What they doing over there? 

MOMMA DEE	The sand this sound and then they supposed to schlack it over and BLEEP. 

LIL SCRAPPY	Wow. 

MOMMA DEE	And the BLEEP ain’t done. Like I just feel like a mother BLEEP bent me the BLEEP over and BLEEP me like no goddamn grease. How the BLEEP you going to pimp a pimp.  

LIL SCRAPPY	I’ll tell you about my momma. If it pop off she just pop off she don’t think about it. She just go, she just trained to go, ttg. 

LIL SCRAPPY	So when is the date for them to have everything ready? 

MOMMA DEE	He talking about tomorrow, but you see that’s not true. So it could be…

LIL SCRAPPY	Well then just wait until tomorrow and then if he don’t do it tomorrow we’re going to holler at him. 

MOMMA DEE	And in that order. 
LIL SCRAPPY	She got this thing where the whole world’s against her. Like she still in her pimpish ways because she used to pimp and sell dope back in the day. 

MOMMA DEE	I had to become very hardcore because I had two small kids that depended on momma to see them through and that’s what I did. 

LIL SCRAPPY	Remember that conversation that I said I was going to have with Erica? 

MOMMA DEE	Yeah.

LIL SCRAPPY	I had that the other day. 

MOMMA DEE	What?

LIL SCRAPPY	I had told her that I do love her, I do love Imani. You know and I am trying you know to make them work. But it’s like there’s like a lot of irritating stuff she do. 

MOMMA DEE	She wants a family unit and I can’t blame her on that part. She had a mother that didn’t raise her, that was on crack cocaine. So people in life try to go after things that they were denied or didn’t have when they were growing up. But she can’t make you give that to her. You know because…

LIL SCRAPPY	Nah, especially if she act like she don’t want it given to her. She ain’t…

MOMMA DEE	She does. 

LIL SCRAPPY	Nah, she don’t act like it. She don’t even know how to be affectionate. You feel me? So it’s like how you…

MOMMA DEE	Yeah because she never had that mother’s love that I give you. 

LIL SCRAPPY	Affection don’t have nothing to do with your momma. 

MOMMA DEE	Baby.

MOMMA DEE	When you have somebody that wasn’t raised by their mother they tend to not see things exact the way you know the way that my kids were raised. 

MOMMA DEE	At the end of the day when BLEEP broke out between you and Diamond, Erica stepped in. So she’s there for you. Ya’ll dated for a few years and then ya’ll separated. You got down with Diamond when that got down BLEEP. You know what I’m saying? When in actuality the bitch don’t need a record deal she need a XXXX deal. When it was stinking like it was. 

MOMMA DEE	Scrappy loved himself some Diamond. She made me feel like I should come out of early retirement. I should have took that bitch to the tracks. You feel me? So I could make some money off that ass since Scrappy paid for that ass. Don’t BLEEP with my damn babies. Now you have made me mad. Now I am reliving this BLEEP. And in that order. 

MOMMA DEE	Maybe a lot of parents say like you know you’re kids are grown and let them go you know, but…

LIL SCRAPPY	That’s what I said. You’re kids are grown. Let them go. And then you, you won’t have so much stress on you. 

MOMMA DEE	At the end of the day I want you to be happy. 

LIL SCRAPPY	I dig that. 

MOMMA DEE	It is what it is. Scrappy, merlot, Jones. 

MIMI	If you wanted to spend time with us you would have gotten us a place closer in the city. 

STEVIE J	I’m coming home a little bit more. 

MIMI	A little bit more? 

STEVIE J	I come home more often. 

ERICA	You step out of line as a momma. 

MOMMA DEE	She put drugs in front of you. I would never do that.

ERICA	My momma didn’t do that none of that. 

STEVIE	Mimi.

JOSELINE	You better act like you BLEEP know. 

K. MICHELLE	The last three years were really crazy for me. I got out of a record deal. I lost the love of my life and I lost a lot of friends in the process. So over the past few weeks I’ve meeting with some friends to reconnect. 

K. MICHELLE	Hey.

RASHEEDA	Hey, how are you?

K. MICHELLE	Today I am catching up with Rasheeda who is a fellow artist. 

RASHEEDA	Are you still on Jive?

K. MICHELLE	I have gone through I think the longest battle. I am trying to get off of the label. 

RASHEEEDA	Really?

K. MICHELLE	I was signed to Jive Records. To a guy who was from my hometown. He was gorgeous. I mean he had huge arms, tattoos. And he gave me my dream that I always wanted. And that was a record deal. 

K. MICHELLE	When it was about six months later we started to date and um it wasn’t a bad relationship. Until one day he flipped and he beat my ass. 

K. MICHELLE	All I can remember is screaming saying it’s me. Like it’s me, I love you. It’s me K. it’s me. He wasn’t there.

K. MICHELLE	People behind the scenes from the record label to everywhere they knew the truth. When business is involved no one care if you’re hurt. Everybody wants you to sing, shut up and make the money. 

K. MICHELLE	He bought chains, rings, everything out of my recording budget. Over two million dollars with nothing to show for it. No album, no music, no anything. 

K. MICHELLE	So you got your fans like “where’s the music. Oh, she’s a flop, what’s going on?” Don’t nobody know. 

RASHEEDA	Nobody understands. 

K. MICHELLE	So I am caught in the middle. You know working with knew people. I still have to fight down the stereotype that K. Michelle is outright crazy. 

K. MICHELLE	My last couple of years on that label I was crazy as BLEEP. I got beat up. Nobody’s going to help me? Nobody helped me. I eventually got out and I am here where I am now. And I am grateful to still be in the business.

K. MICHELLE	I’m back, you know new place. Just want a fresh start from the situation. You know? 

MOMMA DEE	Whoa me. Wow, wassup girl? 

MOMMA DEE	I fixed my place up, it’s looking good. And so I called Erica to have a chat with her about how Scrappy feels about her, how she feels about my son and where this is really going. 

MOMMA DEE	I called you over here because Scrappy is used to the love, overbearing mother.

ERICA	I know. 

MOMMA DEE	Nothing against you, but he’s saying he’s missing that in the relationship.  How come you as a woman, ah, black woman, uh, now if you want him I suggest you show him a little more love, a little more comfort because that’s what he’s expecting. 

ERICA	I do show him love. What do you call taking him back after Diamond kicked him to the curb. Momma Dee is so into sheltering Scrappy that she can’t see me showing him love. 

ERICA	You step out of line as a momma. 

MOMMA DEE	You don’t know nothing about that. 

ERICA	What you mean I don’t know nothing about that?

MOMMA DEE	Because in your past your momma didn’t raise you. You were raised by an aunt.

ERICA	So, so what that was still my momma. What that got to do with anything?

MOMMA DEE	Because you don’t know. You don’t know about BLEEP realization about a mother and a child. 

ERICA	You making no sense. Yes I do. I still had a mother figure. You don’t know her. 

MOMMA DEE	But she put drugs in front of you. I would never do that.

ERICA	My momma didn’t do none of that. You don’t know nothing about what I’ve been through. I’m promise you don’t.

MOMMA DEE	See that’s what I was saying about your momma. No lie. 

ERICA	You need to reflect on yourself.

ERICA	I guess she forgets where she comes from. She was a pimp. I’m in a relationship with Scrappy. That means me and scrappy so Momma Dee needs to mind her own business.

ERICA	You want him to be like you? You’re forty-eight and you’re alone. 

MOMMA DEE	Mm hmm. No I don’t want him alone. 

ERICA	So you want to see both your kids happy? Regardless of who they’re with? 

MOMMA DEE	Yes, but I got to tell you the exception to the rule. 

ERICA	(LAUGHS)

MOMMA DEE	Oh my god. I’m having a visual. When he broke up with Diamond. Do you know the mother BLEEP let the bitch back in after Soulja Boy? For a month. Talking about, “If I’m happy mama… you should be happy.” I couldn’t. 

ERICA	But you, but you just said. 

MOMMA DEE	I couldn’t, I went against it. The queen went against it. I’m on the throne and I’m not giving up my seat until I know that it can be done right. 

ERICA	Momma Dee can be crazy when it comes to her son. It makes things difficult for me, but it’s hard not to feel sorry for her sometimes. 
ERICA	You took your medicine today?

MOMMA DEE	No, I haven’t had it in five days. 

ERICA	Okay, alright. (CLAPS)

MOMMA DEE	But I do know this whatever is going on with you and Scrappy, try to fix it. 

MIMI	I called Stevie to discuss if he intended to share this home with Eva and I as a family. I’m not interested in living out in the sticks with me and my daughter while he’s in the city living it up. 

MIMI	I don’t care if we’re in a two bedroom, if we’re in a studio apartment as long as we’re together. That’s what matters to me. If you wanted to spend time with us and come home every night you would have gotten us a place closer in the city because that’s where you are. 

STEVIE J	I respect that. Let’s say I come home as soon as I am done working. 

MIMI	What does that mean?

STEVIE J	Sometimes days require more hours. I’m just getting back to loving music again.

MIMI	Okay.  

STEVIE J	So yes I’ll come home when I am finished working. 

MIMI	How about you set up a studio in the house? 

STEVIE J	I know you was going to go there. 

MIMI	How about that?

STEVIE J	But look it’s like this. 

MIMI	(LAUGHS)

STEVIE J	It’s different from being creative in the house then outside in the studio. Where I’m…

MIMI	What’s the difference? 

STEVIE J	It’s just a different, it’s just a different vibe. 

MIMI	So what are you saying? 

STEVIE J	I’m saying that I can come home a little bit more.

MIMI	A little bit..

STEVIE J	I come home more, I come home more often. It’ll be our home. 

MIMI	And home is what? 

STEVIE J	Where the heart is. (LAUGHS)

MIMI	(LAUGHS)

MIMI	It’s hard to stay mad at Stevie. He has this ability to always make me smile and laugh. Sometimes I wish I didn’t love him so damn much. It’d be a whole hell of a lot easier. 

STEVIE J	Making love all night until the sun come up. Let’s get to that. 

MIMI	Well you got to come home for that. 

STEVIE J	Breakfastes? 

MIMI	Yeah.

STEVIE J	Veggie sausage? 

MIMI	BLEEP. (LAUGHS)

STEVIE J	(LAUGHS)

KARLIE	So you guys are?

JOSELINE	Oh, he’s my manager. 

ANTONIO	You’re MANager? 

KARLIE/ANTONIO/JOSELINE	(LAUGH)

KARLIE	Joseline is a real chick. She ride or die for her man. Her man is Stevie J. 

ARIANE	I’m sorry no it’s not. 

MIMI	Excuse me. 

ARIANE	That’s her man. 

MIMI	If you walk the BLEEP out of here and get in that car with that bitch and go to the studio, you showing me what the BLEEP you’re doing. 

JOSELINE	Stevie had a meeting with an industry friend so he asked me to tag along. And I’m like of course because I just love spending time with Stevie. He’s just so sexy.

STEVIE	My brother. How you doing? 

ANTONIO	My brother. What’s the word bro. 

JOSELINE	Hi. 

KARLIE	Hi. How are you? 

JOSELINE	How you doing?

KARLIE	I give hugs. 

JOSELINE	Oh, you’re so beautiful. 

KARLIE	I’m Karlie Red and I sing and rap. I’m originally from Trinidad and my boyfriend is Antonio Reid. 

ANTONIO	That’s Karlie man. 

KARLIE	He’s the son of legendary record executive L.A. Reid. He was able to get me a meeting with Stevie J who I’ve been wanting to work with for a very long time. 

KARLIE	I need that hit. 

STEVIE J	So your sound is like you’re going for the Triny sound? Or you, what are you going for? 

KARLIE	No, I’m going for that swag, R&B swag because that’s like my whole style. 

STEVIE J	Okay. 

KARLIE	I can do a whole Jamaican rap for you. 

STEVIE J	Definitely have to mix that.

KARLIE	Yeah, oh yeah.
STEVIE J	International around…

KARLIE	Absolutely. Me I have a man asking who that? When the sun come upon the blue rocks. Some freaky, freaky won’t you tell me how many are true that. Karlie not going to make the same point, screw that. 

STEVIE J	Mmm.

JOSELINE	Oh, she’s hot.

KARLIE	(LAUGHS)

JOSELINE	You definitely got to get to work with her because she’s hot, baby.

ANTONIO	She is a ball of energy and the music is that. 

STEVIE J	Coming from you in general, you know what I’m saying I know it’s serious, so you know. 

ANTONIO	You know the bar is high. 

STEVIE J	Yeah, I’m stepping to the plate and I am going to give you exactly what you need. 

ANTONIO	My man. 

STEVIE J	You know what I am saying?

JOSELINE	He’s the best. 

STEVIE J	Thank you, baby. 

KARLIE	(GIGGLES)

KARLIE	Stevie J introduced Joseline as his artist. She was all over him. I mean whatever they got going on that’s between them two. All I know is I’m trying to get into the studio with Stevie J. 

JOSELINE	He loves to wok with beautiful women too, so he’ll definitely pull in extra hard work. 

KARLIE	As long as you let him put in that hard work for me I’m good. 

JOSELINE	Baby I’m not, ugh. Baby I’ll be right there with him. Don’t you worry about it. 

ANTONIO	(CHUCKLES)

JOSELINE	So be ready.

ANTONIO	You’re MANager?

KARLIE	(GIGGLES) Yeah. (GIGGLES)

ANTONIO/KARLIE	(LAUGH)

STEVIE J	I handle things.

KARLIE	It’s pretty obvious how he handles Joseline. But, I’m wondering what does he have in mind for me? Is it work or pleasure?

KARLIE	Stevie I will sleep in the studio as much as you need me to.

JOSELINE	We got to get us a treadmill so we can go running. Because we got to keep this body together so…


KARLIE	(LAUGHS) Oh yeah, yeah definitely we got to get this like…

ANTONIO	Oh ya’ll showing off, ya’ll showing off.

KARLIE	(GIGGLES)

ANTONIO	For real, I’m not mad. (CLAPS)

JOSELINE	How you think this would look together? To do a song together? 

KARLIE	Oh my god.

ANTONIO	That was actually my next topic of conversation. Just figuring out how to put ya’ll in a record together. 

JOSELINE	I’m ready to do that. 

STEVIE J	Absolutely, absolutely. 

JOSELINE	Yeah. What do you think baby?

STEVIE J	I think that’s an excellent idea. 

KARLIE	(LAUGHS)

ANTONIO	To success and money. 

STEVIE J	Let’s do it. 

JOSELINE	Get that check. 

STEVIE J	Cha-ching.

ARIANE	Did you say Joseline?

ARIANE	I’m sorry no she’s not.

MIMI	-Ager. 

KARLIE	Them two together is like some unseperable BLEEP 

MIMI	She was there too?

KARLIE	Oh yeah. 

MIMI	You got to explain to me what you are talking about. She said that’s my man.

ARIANE	She said this is my man. 

KARLIE	I seen it. I, you don’t have to tell me. I seen it. 

MIMI	I’m confused. 

ARIANE	I’m not, I don’t…

MIMI	Tonight was supposed to be about me and my girlfriends kicking it, but once again Stevie’s got me all BLEEP up. 

KARLIE	Did you not know that they were together? Or they were seeing each other, or you just know that that was the artist.

MIMI	I know they work together because he’s her manager. But the whole intertwine it’s like BLEEP me up. 

K. MICHELLE	Girl, I’ma go out of here. Honey I am…

BACKGROUND	(LAUGHING)

STEVIE J	Let me slide, yeah, yeah let me get in here a little bit. 

K. MICHELLE	I just know when they throw drinks, drinks don’t have no name on it. And I just got my hair done and I didn’t want to be around it. I immediately got out of harm’s way. 

STEVIE J	You look amazing tonight. 

MIMI	Are you serious?

STEVIE J	Did you meet, did you see…

MIMI	What?

STEVIE J	Did you meet, you seen, you said hi to shorty? 

MIMI	No. 

STEVIE J	Should I?

MIMI	Should you? 

STEVIE J	Come on. 

STEVIE J	Mimi started looking at me with those eyes you can know, when, when, when, when you done BLEEP up. You know what I mean? You can feel it. I just felt that it was a problem. Code red. So the night began to be interesting. 

JOSELINE	We kissed?

STEVIE J	We kissed?

JOSELINE	We kissed? 

KARLIE	I’ve seen it.

STEVIE J	Wow. 

MIMI	Oh word?

STEVIE	I’m, I was looking for you.

MIMI	For real? You wasn’t looking for BLEEP in the car with her. 

STEVIE J	(Indiscernable)

MIMI	Are you BLEEP serious right now?

STEVIE J	Hold on. Wait a minute. Man, hold up.

JENNY BAPST	“Party Life” Feeling like a super hero. 

MIMI	You got to understand. 

STEVIE	Her manger. 

MIMI	I have been through so much BLEEP and my trust factor is real low. So I know how that studio life is, late nights and BLEEP liquor. This, that and the third. I already know what the BLEEP it is. 

JOSELINE	Okay, but do you not trust him? You don’t trust him?

MIMI	Is that a trick question? 

JOSELINE	I mean Mimi you ain’t got to get out of line. The thing is a man is going to be a man amd you just going to have to get that through your head. That don’t mean I’m BLEEP him, but I’ma work with him. 

ARIANE	Where does Stevie find these trash bags? Seriously she looks like a BLEEP clown. 

JOSELINE	And I ain’t going to stop working with him. Until you catch us you can’t really blame me for nothing. 

JOSELINE	Until you see us kissing, until you see us sexing don’t come at me with that. I can’t help that I’m beautiful and that he beautiful and yeah when we step in the building we, we look real good together. But Stevie and I have great chemistry so I can’t help that.

KARLIE	I’m so worried about you right now.

MIMI	I’m cool.

KARLIE	Look at me. Look at me. Do I have to make a choice? 

MIMI	I would never put you in that position. 

KARLIE	You sure?

MIMI	Never.

KARLIE	If you weren’t BLEEP, why you calling him daddy? Why are you telling him that you are going to take care of him when he gets home, daddy?

ARIANE	Can we ask Karlie how she got the fact that they were together? 

JOSELINE	They ask you questions that’s going to BLEEP you up at the end. And they going to be chilling, but you going to be looking stupid. You got to be smarter than that. 

ARIANE	I’m leaving. 

STEVIE J	Yo Ariane come here. 

KARLIE	You ask me a question have you seen them together kissing, face or whatever? I’m going to keep it real, yes I have.

JOSELINE	We kissed?

STEVIE J	We kissed?

JOSELINE	We kissed?

KARLIE	I’ve seen it. 

JOSELINE	We kissed in the lip?

STEVIE J	Wow.

STEVIE J	I don’t think Karlie should have came at Mimi like that. Without, without the full scope of everything. It’s just like, it’s messy. Karlie is a rat.

STEVIE J	You looking like you ready to kill me. MIMI	Yeah you right. 

STEVIE J	You not listening to me. Just give me two, just give me…

MIMI	I want to knock your BLEEP head off your shoulders right now. BLEEP.

STEVIE J	Alright, alright. We’re not going to be violent. 

MIMI	She saw ya’ll kissing? 

STEVIE J	I ain’t kiss her. 

MIMI	What did you do? 

STEVIE J	I didn’t kiss her. 

JOSELINE	You getting a kick out this BLEEP ain’t you?

KARLIE	No I’m trippin’.

STEVIE J	She getting a kick out of it. Out of seeing this right here. 

JOSELINE	She getting a real kick out of seeing this BLEEP.

STEVIE J	That’s what she said. 

ARIANE	Oh yeah, let’s go. 

STEVIE J	Hold on.

ARIANE	Please Stevie let me go. 

MIMI	I’m going to go. 

ARIANE	Come on, come on Mimi. 

STEVIE J	You not going nowhere. 

MIMI	I’m going home. 

STEVIE J	Let me, let me just talk to her for a second. 

ARIANE	She got to go for a second. 

MIMI	I’m going home.

STEVIE J	Let me holla at you for a minute. 

ARIANE	Mimi get up! Come on. 

STEVIE J	Yo, can you. Yo, come on. Wait a minute. 

ARIANE	Give me this purse and let’s go. 

ARIANE	Mimi is definitely an enable when it comes to situations like that. She should have punched him in his BLEEP face. I would have. I want to see her do better. 

STEVIE J	Mimi!

JOSELINE	You, you better act like you BLEEP know. 

STEVIE J	Act like I know what?

JOSELINE	Act like you BLEEP know.

STEVIE J	What, what, or what?

JOSELINE	Don’t…

JOSELINE	He threw a drink at me and messed up my fur that I got from Neiman’s. I could’ve killed him. Oh but don’t worry he’s going to buy me a new one.  

JOSELINE	BLEEP him he left. I’m done with this BLEEP. Can’t be dealing with this bitch and her fucking emotions. 

STEVIE J	What’s up ma? Hold up ma. Hold on man. 

MIMI	Oh word? Really? Oh word? For real?

STEVIE J	I was looking for you.

MIMI	You wasn’t looking for BLEEP in the car with her. 

STEVIE J	No I wasn’t. 

MIMI	Are you BLEEP serious right now? 

STEVIE J	Chill. Wait a minute. Man hold up. 

JOSELINE	Go home, deal with your emotions. Let him go to the studio with his artist that going to make him a billion BLEEP dollars and let is get to work. 

MIMI	I’m not with this limbo BLEEP. I’m tired of you just telling me…

STEVIE J	Hold on this is not, this is not no limbo BLEEP. You’re talking about my life, you’re not talking about some regular…

MIMI	This is my, no you talking about my BLEEP life. I’m not the one playing BLEEP games. You are, you having a good BLEEP time around this bitch.

STEVIE J	I ain’t really having a good time.

MIMI	Well I can’t BLEEP tell. 

STEVIE J	I don’t give a BLEEP what you think. It ain’t that. 

MIMI	I ain’t chasing this mother BLEEP. What he’s trying to do is play me and play her, and have it all and do it all and you can’t. It’s just life doesn’t work like that. 

STEVIE J	It’s all about working. That’s it, period, point blank. 

MIMI	But you kissing bitches. 

STEVIE J	That bitch ain’t seen nothing. 

MIMI	Okay.

STEVIE J	Just making BLEEP up. 

MIMI	Why would she make some BLEEP up? Why would she make that up?

STEVIE J	She’s calling.

MIMI	Who’s calling? I don’t give a BLEEP.

STEVIE J	Hello?

MIMI	Are you BLEEP serious right now?

STEVIE J	You got to give me, you got to give me a second. 

MIMI	Are you BLEEP serious right now? Go!

STEVIE J	I want you to come too. 

MIMI	I’m not going no BLEEP nowhere. Go. If it’s that BLEEP important to you. Get the BLEEP out of here. 

STEVIE J	Can we just go for…

JOSELINE	Grow up, let him go to work. We got money to make. If I don’t get in the studio I can’t make no money, he can’t make no money, you won’t have no money. So what are you doing?

MIMI	That’s what we doing?

JOSELINE	It’s one o’clock. Yeah that’s what he’s doing. 

STEVIE J	We all could go. 

MIMI	No, no the BLEEP we all can’t go no BLEEP nowhere. 

STEVIE J	I want you to see. 

JOSELINE	She sure can’t, not with that attitude. She ain’t feeling to BLEEP in up my vibe. 

MIMI	You damn right. 

JOSELINE	You ain’t BLEEP up my vibe tonight. 

MIMI	You mother BLEEP right. 

JOSELINE	Let’s go to the BLEEP studio. 

MIMI	We ain’t go no BLEEP where. If you walk the BLEEP out of here and get in that car with that bitch and go to the studio you showing me what the BLEEP you’re doing. 

MIMI	I have no idea why Joseline is so angry. If anybody should be BLEEP angry it should be me. The bitch just needs to go ahead with her life. Her, Stevie can go BLEEP themselves. Honestly. 

JOSELINE	What the BLEEP you getting in here for? Aren’t you going to ride with her?

STEVIE	You c’mon man don’t.

ARIANE	Wow. Is this really happening right now?

MIMI	You always want to bleep bitches, but you never want to handle the BLEEP after the fact.  

STEVIE J	I’m not trying to argue with you. Yeah.

MIMI	Because you don’t have no BLEEP argument. 

MIMI	Go with your stank ass whore.

MIMI	And have a good BLEEP life. 

STEVIE J	Make me.
