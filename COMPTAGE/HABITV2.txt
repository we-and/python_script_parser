MADS	Salty and sweet.

MADS	And that was my mother.

MADS	Always did have

MADS	a flavor for danger.

MADS	Pickled in her wine,

MADS	she so desperately tried.

MADS	Oh, but she couldn't take care of me.

MADS	Uh-uh.

MADS	Not like you did, anyway.

MADS	Lord,

MADS	I know you've put me here for a reason…

MADS	and Lord knows,

MADS	I've tried to forget it.

MADS	But through all these choppy waters,

MADS	I thank you,

MADS	my dear Jesus, for keeping this humble heart…

MADS	beating free.

MADS	My love,

MADS	my Lord,

MADS	my Savior.

MADS	I love you, I love you, I love you,

MADS	I just wanna marry you.

MADS	Oh, Jesus, you're my one and only.

MADS	I swear I will always

WOMAN	Hey,

WOMAN	I told you to clean the

WOMAN	Really?

WOMAN	This is what you're doing in the middle of the goddamn day?

WOMAN	Great.

WOMAN	Can't you just be a normal kid?

MADS	Normal kid?

MADS	Well, that I do.

MADS	Yeah, not so great, I guess, but not your fault so much.

MADS	Unless this was all a part of your silly old plan.

MADS	Ugh, fuck me.

MADS	I can't believe you're making me do this shit.

MERLE	Hello again.

MERLE	I'm Merle, a sex and love addict.

GROUP	Hello, Merle.

MERLE	Well, in spite of all the progress I've made, I…

MERLE	recently had another bottom-line slip.

MERLE	I'm really ashamed. I…

MERLE	really thought this time was gonna be different.

MERLE	A real relationship, you know.

MERLE	It lasted all of six days.

MERLE	On our final night together,

MERLE	he, um… bit my lip so hard it bled,

MERLE	and I started to cry.

MERLE	Um…

MERLE	And then he told me that he had a fantasy

MERLE	of making love to a woman while she was crying.

MERLE	So, mission accomplished.

MERLE	But…

MERLE	he told me that he loved me,

MERLE	and then, after he left, he, um…

MERLE	blocked my number and unfollowed me.

MERLE	And I just feel really worthless.

MADS	And you said, "I am the Light of the world,

MADS	but he who follows Me will not

MADS	walk in the darkness

MADS	but shall have the light of love."

SONG	I wonder where you are

SONG	Maybe you wanna get back home

SONG	I don't wanna be on my own tonight

SONG	I don't wanna be left alone

SONG	No I don't wanna be on my own to

ERIC	Do I know you?

MADS	Uh, yeah. I'm, uh, I'm Mads. I'm here to

ERIC	Oh! Evie's friend from home.

ERIC	They do grow 'em pretty in Texas.

ERIC	You're late.

MADS	I didn't know there was a set schedule for this shit.

ERIC	No. Come in.

MADS	Wait, so, you're you're not American?

MADS	'Cause, like, on your TV show, you were

ERIC	Acting.

MADS	Oh! Ah, funny. Ha-ha.

ERIC	Can I get you something?

MADS	Uh, nope, nope. I'm cool as a cucumber.

ERIC	So you're out here to be an actress?

MADS	Ah… no. Nope.

ERIC	Oh, most people are here to be something.

ERIC	Escape whatever unseen, invalidated life

ERIC	they're running from. Are you ambitious?

MADS	Ambition always seemed like a pointy word to me,

MADS	like, um… arrow or thorn, you know. Just

MADS	I feel like it just depends on the things you're into.

MADS	But I do think that I'm meant for, uh, somethin' or somebody.

ERIC	A romantic? You're a rare animal.

ERIC	Take a word of advice from a kindred spirit

ERIC	keep moving before you get stuck.

ERIC	This place is a trap, you know.

ERIC	Just like those pits down by the museums.

ERIC	Thousands of years ago, this whole valley was a swamp.

ERIC	Animals came from hundreds of miles around

ERIC	mammoths, saber tooth cats,

ERIC	uh, dire wolves,

ERIC	all lured by the scent of sweet water.

ERIC	But the ground under this place isn't solid, it's tar.

ERIC	Black and sticky as the Devil's shit.

ERIC	Those animals, they got trapped in it

ERIC	and their dying cries brought out scavengers

ERIC	looking for an easy meal, and they got stuck, too.

ERIC	Thousands of years later,

ERIC	scientists are still pulling fossils out of those pits,

ERIC	skeletons all mixed up.

ERIC	Be careful.

ERIC	Someday, someone will be digging you up.

ERIC	And with so many bones,

ERIC	they won't even be able to tell you apart.

ERIC	Trick to LA is,

ERIC	take a sip from the spring,

ERIC	spread your wings, catch a breeze,

ERIC	and ride on out of here before you get stuck.

MADS	Why do dealers always sound like preachers?

MADS	I mean, honestly,

MADS	are you a-a prophet or a pusher?

MADS	Just make up your mind.

ERIC	Hm. Yeah, I don't know.

ERIC	Evie tells me you girls are working the club tonight.

MADS	Uh, yeah, yeah.

MADS	I think I might come by.

ERIC	You can always work for me, you know.

MADS	Uh, look. I just came here

MADS	'cause I got a car and I was in the neighborhood.

MADS	I'm not really looking to be

MADS	your friendly neighborhood dope peddler.

MADS	But thank you.

ERIC	By the way, I love your big, fat gold LTD. '72?

ERIC	Don't see them around much.

MADS	Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

ERIC	I know your ride. I know your plates.

ERIC	I know your friends.

ERIC	So what don't I know about you, Mads?

MADS	Uh, yeah, yeah. Cool. Uh

ERIC	Thanks for coming by.

MADS	Uh-huh.

ERIC	Yeah.

ADDY	Morning!

MADS	Boom. Package.

ADDY	Teddy.

ADDY	Hey, Mads. Um…

ADDY	You ever hear from that, uh, guy you were fucking at Community?

MADS	What?

ADDY	Didn't he get a job out here or somethin'?

MADS	No idea. What on Earth made you think of him?

ADDY	I don't know. I guess… all these drugs.

ADDY	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

ADDY	You know…

ADDY	You really ought to quit that dumb-ass job of yours.

MADS	Oh, boy.

ADDY	Come on, folding 400-dollars sweaters

ADDY	for ten bucks an hour

ADDY	is an insult to your postmodern, feminist sensibilities.

EVIE	Oh, is it?

ADDY	We've gotta work to destabilize

ADDY	the patriarchal norms entrenched into our society

ADDY	that has caused so much gender inequality.

MADS	I love how much you care about this.

EVIE	Plus, you'd make way more selling Eric's drugs.

MADS	Oh, well, I also… got fired last night.

EVIE	Why?

ADDY	What?

MADS	Uh-huh.

MADS	Because I kinda-sorta fucked the boss' husband again!

EVIE	Again?

MADS	Again!

EVIE	That's awesome.

ADDY	I guess old habits die hard, sweetie.

MADS	Um, they do.

ADDY	Well, then, it's settled.

ADDY	You're working at the club with us now.

MADS	No!

EVIE	Yes.

MADS	I said maybe.

MADS	Working at the club, a.k.a.

MADS	selling a bunch of shit Astros to LA's horniest crackheads.

SONG	They're all the same, don't go

EVIE	She's fine again.

EVIE	Whoo!

SONG	Turn it up, turn it up Turn it up!

ADDY	Oh, come on, Mads. It's gonna be fun.

EVIE	I told ya.

ADDY	You know, they say Marilyn's buried here,

ADDY	and also James Dean and also Whitney Houston.

EVIE	It's like a séance.

MADS	I can't believe it.

MADS	Oh my Lord! 

JEWEL	So, another little sister here from Texas

JEWEL	to help Evie out?

EVIE	Sort of. Only Addy's my actual blood.

EVIE	We grew up with Mads.

EVIE	She's like our honorary little sister.

JEWEL	Well, we're all family here.

JEWEL	Hey, L'Amour.

L'AMOUR	Hm?

JEWEL	What do you think?

L’AMOUR	Hm…

L’AMOUR	Now, let me take a look.

L’AMOUR	Let's see here. The religious jewelry,

L’AMOUR	smoky eye, pouty red lip, I like it.

L’AMOUR	She's like a gothic Madonna.

ADDY	It's funny you say that

ADDY	because Mads has like a little Jesus thing.

L’AMOUR	Hm, Jesus?

EVIE	Yeah, and I'd say that she takes it

EVIE	to the next level though.

EVIE	Mads doesn't just love Jesus, she'd love to fuck Jesus.

MADS	Evie!

L’AMOUR	Well, you can't blame her.

L’AMOUR	Jesus is quite sexy. Our first rockstar.

JEWEL	Hm-mm.

L’AMOUR	Definitely.

MADS	Well, there just went 200 bucks of Eric's crap.

MADS	Oh, God, I should have listened to you.

MADS	Why don't I listen to you?

MADS	Mom always told me that was never much my strong suit.

MADS	Maybe she was right.

MADS	Fuckin' bitch.

MADS	I'm so fucked up.

EVIE	There you are.

EVIE	Are you okay?

EVIE	Your shift is done.

EVIE	Why don't you just get changed and put on some makeup?

ADDY	Evie, why do you drag me into this shit?

ADDY	Huh?

ADDY	You're supposed to be my older sister.

MADS	Stop yelling at her, okay? It's not helping anything.

MADS	You need to call Eric.

EVIE	What is the plan, huh?

MADS	You need to call Eric.

ADDY	Can you just do it, please?

MADS	He needs to fucking know why all the money

MADS	and all his fucking drugs are gone, okay?

EVIE	Can you just please do it because he has a crush on you

EVIE	and he's not gonna yell at you, and he always yells at me.

MADS	Oh, my God, Evie.

ADDY	kay.

EVIE	Please, you're so much better at this

ADDY	Where's the lighter?

EVIE	and I can't do it.

ADDY	Where the fuck is the lighter?

EVIE	Please… I'm so sorry.

MADS	Evie…

ADDY	Just fucking call Eric. Just go and call Eric.

EVIE	I'm sorry.

MADS	Oh, God.

ADDY	What the fuck is this?

EVIE	I don't know.

ERIC	What do you mean gone?

MADS	It's gone. Stolen.

ERIC	Oh no.

ERIC	No, no, no.

ERIC	I trusted you guys to fulfill basic services.

ERIC	This is fucking unprofessional.

MADS	Yeah, well, I mean, we fucked up.

ERIC	Well, you better un-fuck it up.

ERIC	This is not some random shit

ERIC	I got off of one of my usual guys.

ERIC	This is a scary fucking drug dealer

ERIC	that I'm trying to make a good impression with.

ERIC	And spoiler alert:

ERIC	This is not impressive!

MADS	You know what?

MADS	How about you just stop being such a little bitch

MADS	and nut up, okay?

MADS	It wasn't a kilo. It was 20 grand, tops.

MADS	We'll figure it out.

ERIC	And she does not fuck around.

QUEENIE	Get out!

QUEENIE	Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuuuuuuck!

ERIC	So either find who stole that shit,

ERIC	or find a way to get me that 20 grand back.

ERIC	Fuck!

MADS	Fuck you, too, then.

MADS	Fuck!

MADS	Guys, he's really fucking freaking out!

ADDY	We're getting fucking evicted.

EVIE	No.

MADS	What?

ADDY	We're being evicted!

ADDY	This is why I left.

ADDY	This is why I left and went to London

ADDY	because I didn't wanna be fucking poor in America.

MADS	Alright.

ADDY	And I didn't wanna be around a sister

ADDY	who's a fucking crack addict.

EVIE	Okay, who's a coke addict, not a crack addict.

MADS	Fuck!

SONG	I always feel so empty

SONG	Whenever you pack to leave

MADS	Okay, well, I fucking tried to get a roof over our heads.

MADS	And this bitch, she don't get it.

MADS	You know what?

MADS	Fuck her and her piece of shit house

MADS	and the horse she rode in on.

MADS	She probably fucked him, too!

MADS	I mean, I definitely'll be fucked in real life…

MADS	kinda.

MADS	Anyway, right now…

MADS	right now I need your help more than ever.

MADS	I need you to walk me down your righteous ways.

MADS	I need you to show me that light because…

MADS	I really just don't wanna hurt no more people.

MADS	Show me a sign.

MADS	Show me a sign.

MADS	Show me a sign.

MADS	Oh!

MADS	You're a fucking badass!

MADS	Woo! I love you, JC! I fuckin' love you!

MADS	Woo!

ERIC	Please tell me you found it.

MADS	No. I told you, it's gone.

ERIC	Shit! You guys are forcing me

ERIC	to do something I don't wanna do.

ERIC	I do not want to give you girls up.

ERIC	But Queenie plays rough.

MADS	You think I'm a fucking idiot

MADS	just 'cause I have an inny?

MADS	You're the big dog, okay? Not some low-level street pawns.

MADS	No matter how bad we might fuck up,

MADS	that money is ultimately on you, bud.

ERIC	I can make you get that money back.

MADS	Why are you front of me right now?

MADS	You're no pimp. You're no killer.

MADS	You're just a has-been TV actor

MADS	with a gambling addiction and a coke habit.

MADS	And and my sense tells me that clearly

MADS	you're broke as fuck

MADS	and you're in some real type of trouble because nobody

MADS	runs a business like that with no security.

MADS	I mean, that is just desperation behavior.

MADS	Uh-huh, out of control. And that shit ends bad.

MADS	So, like I said,

MADS	I don't have a problem.

MADS	You do.

ERIC	Why are you even here?

MADS	Where the fuck is your bedroom?

MADS	You're so awesome.

MADS	Oh, I can't even stand to breathe when I think of you.

MADS	I will always be your girl, Jesus.

ERIC	I wasn't expecting that from you.

MADS	Yup. I'm full of surprises.

MADS	I gotta go pee.

ERIC	Mads?

ERIC	Babe?

ERIC	Fuck!

ADDY	You're crazy! This is never gonna work!

MADS	Of course it'll work.

MADS	You ever heard of "Jesus take the wheel"?

MADS	Well, in our case, Jesus is taking us by the hips

MADS	with his manly, calloused, carpenter hands

MADS	and he is ridin' us all the way back home

MADS	to Kingdom Come.

MADS	I'm telling you, Jesus will not steer us wrong.

EVIE	I'm I'm an atheist.

MADS	Well, not anymore, you're not.

ADDY	Okay. So, we're just supposed to tell people

ADDY	we came to Hollywood to start a convent?

MADS	Only if they ask. Just keep it simple.

MADS	So, we'll meet back here in two hours?

ADDY	Sisters of the Faithful.

EVIE	Hey, oh, thank you.

EVIE	Do you know where to get waxed around here?

ADDY	Oh! Wait, two bucks?

ADDY	That's all you're gonna give Jesus?

MADS	Fuck.

ADDY	Lady, do you want your soul to be damned for all eternity

ADDY	tossing Lucifer's salad?

ADDY	You can afford more. Look at you.

EVIE	Oh, thank you. God bless Jesus Christ!

MAN	You all right?

EVIE	Oh, hell, yeah. I'm sorry.

ADDY	Bitch!

EVIE	We are starting a convent here in Hollywood

EVIE	and if you would like to know more, here's my cell.

MAN	Great.

EVIE	Look, I wrote it right where Jesus got hammered.

EVIE	Ugh, I dream of being hammered, too.

MAN	Thank you.

LIBRARIAN	Hi, Sister.

MADS	I see you like books.

LIBRARIAN	I work in the library.

MADS	Oh!

LIBRARIAN	Are you visiting Los Angeles, Sister?

LIBRARIAN	I haven't seen you before.

MADS	Ah, well, my little convent back home

MADS	is just bursting at the seams.

MADS	So, my Mother Superior sent myself and my Sisters

MADS	down to, you know, look for a new home

MADS	and spread our, uh, our virginity di divinity.

LIBRARIAN	Where are you staying?

MADS	Well, I'm leaving that up to the good Lord Himself.

MADS	Mm-hm.

LIBRARIAN	Well, I… 

LIBRARIAN	hope it's not too much of a bother,

LIBRARIAN	but one of our board members at our library, Maria Ramirez,

LIBRARIAN	everyone calls her Sunny.

LIBRARIAN	You know, she's a devout Catholic and generous donor.

LIBRARIAN	Um, her husband just died recently.

MADS	Oh!

LIBRARIAN	And, um, you and the Sisters should, uh… go see her.

LIBRARIAN	She lives right up the road up there.

LIBRARIAN	Great place, she takes in nuns all the time.

MADS	She does?

MADS	Well, look at God just working His ways. 

LIBRARIAN	Well, she's a very kind person.

LIBRARIAN	And listen, she has more than enough space.

LIBRARIAN	You guys should check it out

LIBRARIAN	if you need a place to stay, all right?

LIBRARIAN	I think she'll love it. So…

LIBRARIAN	here's her number.

LIBRARIAN	Oops, sorry.

LIBRARIAN	Um… okay.

LIBRARIAN	That's for you guys.

MADS	Thank you. Good day, sir.

MADS	So kind.

SONG	Gonna have a good time

MADS	Two hundred and seventy-three dollars.

MADS	Thank you, Jesus!

EVIE	Yes, that is enough to get a cheap hotel room

EVIE	for a couple of nights.

ADDY	Or a really nice hotel room for one night.

MADS	No, no, no.

MADS	We gotta save our money as much as we can.

MADS	We should um, we should go stay with that nice lady.

ADDY	How do-how do you know she's so nice?

MADS	Because she offers to take in stray nuns.

MADS	Der, der, der, der, der.

MADS	Um, she is probably really religious, though.

MADS	And she's probably seen a lot of nuns before.

MADS	So, we should, uh, we should… we should go do our research.

EVIE	Hm.

ADDY	Uh-huh.

MADS	Up our game.

EVIE	What kind of research?

ADDY	Wait. Mads, you want us to go to church?

MADS	Goddamn right! We're going to church!

MADS	But first… first, we… we really need to change.

MADS	Because the only thing worse than

MADS	walking into a church impersonating a nun

MADS	is walking into a police station

MADS	impersonating a cop.

MADS	So, let's go.

EVIE	Oh, God.

EVIE	What do you think you're looking at, old man?

OLD MAN	Uh, n-n-nothing.

EVIE	Hm. That's "Nothing, Sister," to you.

OLD MAN	Nothing, Sister.

EVIE	Hm. Good boy.

EVIE	Now start praying.

OLD MAN	Dear God… please help me with another sister.

EVIE	Addy!

EVIE	I like this character.

EVIE	I could really get into this.

ADDY	Bitch.

ERIC	Ah!

ERIC	Son of what?

ERIC	Fuck! No! No.

ERIC	Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

ERIC	Oh!

ERIC	The fucking gun!

ERIC	Where the fuck is it?

ERIC	Fuck!

ERIC	Ah!

ERIC	Fuck!

ERIC	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

ERIC	No! Bucky, no!

ERIC	No, Bucky, no!

ERIC	Ugh!

ERIC	I'll open the door on one condition.

ERIC	Ugh! I was gonna open the door.

TUFF	My name's Tuff.

TUFF	I work for Queenie.

TUFF	Sit!

TUFF	Make me a vodka!

ERIC	It's okay, Bucky. Th-this is a friend.

ERIC	We're just playing a friendly game.

ERIC	I don't think he can breathe.

TUFF	He's fucking fine.

TUFF	Aren't you?

TUFF	Silly billy. Just a friendly game. Right?

ERIC	Come on, man. This has nothing to do with the kid.

TUFF	Ah, ah, ah.

TUFF	Are you allergic to bees?

TUFF	What a coincidence.

TUFF	So am I. Deathly allergic.

TUFF	And when you're allergic to bees,

TUFF	you need to be prepared.

TUFF	Do you know what one of these is?

ERIC	Oh, Jesus, man, don't!

TUFF	Ah, ah, ah.

TUFF	This protects you from the queen.

TUFF	And believe me, you do not wanna get stung by her.

ERIC	What have you done?

ERIC	What have you done?

ERIC	Motherfucker!

NUNS [singing]	Ave Maria

PRIEST	When you receive the communion, you're united with Jesus.

PRIEST	And He becomes a part of you.

PRIEST	The body of Christ…

SISTER JULIE	May God be with you.

SISTER JULIE	May God be with you.

MADS	Yeah, and to you too, Sister.

SISTER JULIE	Sister Julie. Thank you for coming.

MADS	Hmm.

MADS	Sister Julie, is it?

ADDY	C'mon, Mads, let's go.

ADDY	What was that about?

QUEENIE	Tuff, why is there a child?

QUEENIE	You know I hate them.

TUFF	Hello, gorgeous.

QUEENIE	Hi.

QUEENIE	Uh, why is he tied like that?

TUFF	I had to use the venom on the kid… but look.

TUFF	Uh, that… is for softening the meat.

QUEENIE	Well…

QUEENIE	Nice to "meat" you… Eric.

QUEENIE	Oww, these shoes…

QUEENIE	hurt my feet.

TUFF	All right, I'll finish this one.

QUEENIE	Tuff is so good to me.

QUEENIE	Ooh.

QUEENIE	Ah. So, Eric, we've been talking about you.

QUEENIE	What's your purpose?

QUEENIE	What function do you serve?

QUEENIE	If one cannot perform his function,

QUEENIE	then another must take his place.

ERIC	Oh!

QUEENIE	Oh.

QUEENIE	Huh. These are the females who lost my merchandise?

QUEENIE	Did you know there's a species

QUEENIE	of carpenter ant in Malaysia?

QUEENIE	The queen's body is full of poisonous venom,

QUEENIE	and if her nest is threatened

QUEENIE	by an outsider, this magnificent creature can explode

QUEENIE	her own head in a suicide and release the substance

QUEENIE	onto her enemy.

TUFF	What a soldier!

ERIC	No. Oh… no… 

QUEENIE	This is what I'm talking about, Eric.

QUEENIE	Purpose!

QUEENIE	Now you have one.

ERIC	Oh, my God!

QUEENIE	Dinner!

ERIC	No!

SUNNY	Sisters, welcome to my home.

SUNNY	You'll have to excuse me.

SUNNY	My eyesight isn't what it used to be.

SUNNY	See, I've become terribly sensitive to the light,

SUNNY	which is a shame because the light is

SUNNY	one of my favorite things about living in Southern California.

SUNNY	In a moment, Alicia will show you to your quarters.

SUNNY	And I hope you can meet me for tea in the sunroom

SUNNY	once you've settled in.

SUNNY	Let us know if you need anything.

SUNNY	And thank you so much for coming.

SUNNY	Alicia?

MADS	Uh, thank you for, uh, having us in your… godly home, ma'am.

EVIE	Yeah.

ADDY	Thank you.

MADS	So much space, just in this one area.

ADDY	You know, you guys, the craziest thing

ADDY	about all of this is that that thing,

ADDY	the thing we're wearing around our necks, is called a wimple.

ADDY	What the fuck's a wimple?

EVIE	Oh, my God!

ADDY	I kind of feel bad for Sunny.

ADDY	I mean, all this money and no one to share it with.

EVIE	Oh!

EVIE	No. She played her cards right.

EVIE	She gets to do whatever she wants,

EVIE	doesn't have to look after anybody.

EVIE	Oh, fuck!

EVIE	It's Eric. Should I answer it?

ADDY	!

TUFF	No answer.

QUEENIE	Well, we'll try again later.

MADS	I don't think we can hit the same spot two days in a row.

MADS	I think we should rotate.

MADS	You know, the giving can't always…

MADS	…be so giving.

ALICIA	If I may make a suggestion,

ALICIA	outside the observatory might be a good place.

MADS	Hmm.

ALICIA	Lots of foot traffic.

ADDY	Oh! Thank you.

EVIE	Thank you so much, Alicia.

ALICIA	You're welcome.

ALICIA	Now, if you'll excuse me,

ALICIA	before Madame's breakfast gets cold.

EVIE	Oh, my God! She's fucking hot.

ADDY	Oh, that was one hot piece of ass.

EVIE	Oh, my God!

NEWS ANCHOR	The body of Eric Katz,

NEWS ANCHOR	the actor best known for playing Uncle Darby

NEWS ANCHOR	in the '90s sitcom The Sokolskys,

NEWS ANCHOR	was discovered in his home.

NEWS ANCHOR	Police investigators are saying the bizarre circumstances

NEWS ANCHOR	surrounding his death are likely

ADDY	That's all the money we have?

ADDY	That's all the profits?

ADDY	Where the fuck is Jesus today?

EVIE	Maybe we're being punished.

EVIE	Maybe there's a curse against people

EVIE	that pretend to be saints.

MADS	Nuns aren't saints.

MADS	They're just regular people who work for God by doing charity.

MADS	And technically, we're homeless, so…

MADS	really, we're just cutting out the middle man.

ADDY	Fuck! You can just justify anything, Mads.

MADS	Why have you been on my dick so much recently, Addy?

ADDY	Oh, I love you and your dick.

MADS	Honestly

MADS	You fucking piece of shit!

MADS	Who the fuck fucks with nuns, huh?

MADS	Why don't you steal from?

MADS	Now, you may think this is a bit of an excessive reaction.

MADS	But we all have our periods

MADS	synced up, and as you can see,

MADS	we're already havin' a pretty cramp ass day.

PRIEST	When you receive the communion, you are united with Jesus.

PRIEST	And He becomes a part of you.

MADS	You once told me

MADS	the danger of us sinning isn't that God will stop forgivin' us,

MADS	it's that we will stop seekin' His forgiveness.

MADS	And so, just like you wanted, I went to confess

MADS	my sins. Past, present, and future.

MADS	Ever since I accepted you into my heart

MADS	as my Lord and my Savior,

MADS	it took me into that sacred place.

SONG	Oh no, I've been waiting for anything no one

MADS	I'm not sitting across from a mortal man no more.

MADS	I'm being sent directly through him to you.

VEDA	It appears the winds have changed since we last met.

VEDA	Sunny skies have given way to a dark cloud

VEDA	that now looms above you.

QUEENIE	Dark cloud?

QUEENIE	What dark cloud?

VEDA	This trio of sorceresses, they will challenge your reign.

VEDA	They will be your undoing if you are not careful.

QUEENIE	Those sluts stole my money.

QUEENIE	And you mentioned three of them, right?

QUEENIE	I only saw two of them.

VEDA	Bitch, I told you there's three.

VEDA	There's three. There's three sluts

VEDA	one slut, two slut, three slut.

VEDA	That's not a slut.

QUEENIE	Oh!

VEDA	Just one, two, three sluts.

QUEENIE	Should I kill them?

VEDA	Yes.

QUEENIE	Oh!

QUEENIE	Kill them.

ADDY	this is President Lincoln.

EVIE	I'm so bored.

EVIE	We could be at the club right now.

ADDY	Really?

ADDY	Well, we could sneak on outta here, go down the lattice.

ADDY	Like ninjas.

EVIE	Yes.

ADDY	Why not?

EVIE	And?

ADDY	I think Sunny's asleep.

ADDY	Let's go.

EVIE	Okay.

MADS	If you blow our cover,

MADS	we're fucked.

ADDY	All right, I'll stay here.

ADDY	You go.

EVIE	But

ADDY	I'm on my period, anyway. I'm bloated.

ADDY	I don't wanna be touched by like gross old men.

EVIE	Okay. Have a good night.

EVIE	You guys suck these days.

ADDY	Oh, I hate this thing.

QUEENIE	Huh. So this LA bimbo, who is one of the sorceresses,

QUEENIE	she thinks she's going to crumble our empire.

TUFF	She's the one who stole your stash, babe.

TUFF	Eric kept a ledger in the notes on his phone.

TUFF	Watching, she's his points man.

QUEENIE	What?

QUEENIE	Well, we're going to make

QUEENIE	a little example out of her, aren't we?

QUEENIE	Have you met my friend?

QUEENIE	The Sonoran coral snake.

QUEENIE	These mostly feed on

QUEENIE	rats, bats, little rodents.

QUEENIE	But we've discovered this one

QUEENIE	has an insatiable appetite on human brains.

QUEENIE	Wanna see?

TUFF	I'm gonna film it and I'm gonna text it

TUFF	to your sorceress friends.

ADDY	She's not picking up her phone.

MADS	Just call her again.

ADDY	I did.

ADDY	I've called five times.

ADDY	I feel like I know it's all for dead.

MADS	Just don't say the word dead.

MADS	Can you please just sit the fuck down.

MADS	You've been making me even more crazy.

ADDY	What the fuck!

MADS	Holy shit!

MADS	What the fuck happened? Oh my God! Are you okay?

ADDY	Evie!

MADS	Sit, sit.

MADS	What the fuck?

EVIE	Okay. I killed them!

ADDY	Killed who?

EVIE	I killed both of them.

MADS	What?

ADDY	Who?

EVIE	Queenie and her psycho cowboy sidekick.

MADS	What?

EVIE	Yeah. They kidnapped me.

EVIE	They… they tried to kill me.

MADS	Oh, my God.

EVIE	But I killed them.

MADS	Are you okay?

EVIE	I'm okay.

EVIE	Okay, we have to get out of LA, you guys.

EVIE	The cops are gonna come after me.

EVIE	I'm a little scared.

ADDY	Why?

EVIE	Because I killed them.

MADS	Calm down, calm down.

ADDY	Honey, just…

MADS	We're fine.

MADS	We're fine. You know why?

EVIE	Why?

MADS	Because the cops, they don't give a shit.

MADS	Yeah, they're never gonna find out because they don't care.

MADS	That's just two less bottom feeding

MADS	drug dealers that are gone.

MADS	I mean, you literally just did their jobs tonight.

MADS	They'll do hallelujah.

MADS	Right?

ADDY	Yeah, you killed the motherfuckers who killed Eric!

ADDY	An eye for an eye.

ADDY	Hey Mads, isn't that in the Bible?

MADS	You're sure the fuck right it is.

MADS	You know… you know what else?

ADDY	What?

EVIE	What?

MADS	We're in the clear.

EVIE	Oh, my God!

MADS	You know what that means, right?

MADS	That-that-that there's no more killers anymore.

MADS	We have money comin' in.

MADS	We have a roof over our heads.

ADDY	Oh, my God, guys!

MADS	This is literally our rebirth.

EVIE	Oh, my God, you're right!

EVIE	Oh, my God.

ADDY	I can't believe that.

EVIE	We are so fucking lucky.

MADS	No, no, it's not luck.

MADS	It's, it is exactly divine intervention.

MADS	I mean, it's clear as day.

MADS	This is Jesus coming down and taking the wheel.

EVIE	Oh, my God.

MADS	We- we all knew He would lead us down the right path

MADS	but-but-but tonight, He actually did it.

ADDY	Yeah.

ADDY	Thank you, Jesus.

MADS	Thank you.

EVIE	I can't believe it, God.

ADDY	Oh, my God, I was so fucking scared.

EVIE	Oh, my God, I was too. I love you guys.

MADS	Oh, my God, tell me everything that happened.

EVIE	Oh, my God!

EVIE	Oh, my God, so okay, there were snakes.

MADS	What?

EVIE	Two snakes, black and red one.

MADS	What were they doing with the snakes?

EVIE	Oh, my God, so one was like…

MADS	I know what you're plannin' on doin'.

MADS	And I'd think real long and hard before doin' it if I were you.

MADS	Yeah, well, you are me.

MADS	You've been given a rare gift.

MADS	A clean slate. Why do you always have to fall back on bad habits?

MADS	I've made my decision and I feel bad enough about it already.

MADS	So can you just drop it?

MADS	But do bad girls go to Heaven too?

MADS	Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

SONG	Fall asleep now

SONG	Close your eyes

MADS	Fuck!

SONG	Drift away now

MADS	Here's the thing.

MADS	I know you like all that meditation, hallelujah,

MADS	peace on Earth bullshit.

MADS	But have you ever done heroin?

MADS	We both know I have,

MADS	'cause there's not one minute in my life

MADS	where I'm not thinkin' about it.

MADS	It's the total escape of feeling.

MADS	Pure oblivion.

MADS	Sweet Jesus.

MADS	She almost makes me forget you.

SONG	Just calm down

SONG	Fantasize

SONG	That is shapin' and take control

SONG	The end begins You lose your soul

SONG	Come before it's

SONG	Takes me down

SISTER JULIE	Help! Someone help! Somebody!

SISTER JULIE	Help! Help!

SONG	Take me

SONG	I'm times low

MADS	I've been waiting to meet you my whole life.

MADS	Wow!

MADS	Jesus!

MADS	I'm sorry.

MADS	I love you so much.

MADS	I'm sorry I'm such a fuck-up!

MADS	But from now on…

MADS	I swear I want to do right by you, Lord.

MADS	I do, uh… I wanna be different.

MADS	And I know, uh, I know I've been saying that this whole time,

MADS	but we also know that…

MADS	you know, I kinda have a gift for… rationalizing things.

MADS	From now on,

MADS	I wanna be the kind of person that makes you proud.

MADS	I swear from this rebirth and this…

MADS	this fresh start that you've so generously given me…

MADS	I swear on my soul, I swear on my soul.

MADS	Thank you, Lord.

MADS	Thank…

NURSE	Honey…

NURSE	sweetie, it's time to take your meds.

MADS	Where… where the fuck is Jesus?

NURSE	He's in your heart, sweetie.

NURSE	He's in all of our hearts.

ADDY	Mads.

EVIE	Mads.

ADDY	Are you okay?

SUNNY	Hello?

SUNNY	Alicia?

SUNNY	Sisters?

SUNNY	Who is that?

QUEENIE	Beautiful place you have here, Madame.

QUEENIE	Wouldn't you agree, my dear?

TUFF	Yeah, very fancy. Lots of lovely old knickknacks.

SUNNY	Who are you people?

QUEENIE	Oh, who we are is of little consequence.

QUEENIE	But a little bee told me that

QUEENIE	you might be hiding a few fugitives

QUEENIE	from justice.

SUNNY	Fugitives?

TUFF	Yeah, what?

TUFF	You didn't think they was real nuns, did you?

TUFF	Oh my word!

TUFF	Seems like someone has been takin' advantage

TUFF	of the kindness of a lonely,

TUFF	stupid old woman.

QUEENIE	Ooh!

SUNNY	Nobody's here, and if you don't leave,

SUNNY	I'm going to call the cops.

QUEENIE	Since it appears that you're at a loss for sight,

QUEENIE	here's my blow…

QUEENIE	by blow.

QUEENIE	Now, my associate, Tuff…

TUFF	Associate?

QUEENIE	I'm sorry.

QUEENIE	I just wanted to be professional.

QUEENIE	Oh…

QUEENIE	Okay. Fine.

QUEENIE	And now, my partner and paramour,

QUEENIE	Tuff,

TUFF	Thank you.

QUEENIE	is standing right above you.

QUEENIE	He has a gun to your head, and if you don't tell us

QUEENIE	where those little bitches are by the time I count to three,

QUEENIE	he's going to blow your old, rich brain out. One!

SUNNY	If it's money you want, I have money.

QUEENIE	It's not about money. Two!

SUNNY	O Lord Jesus,

SUNNY	shine your spirit onto me.

QUEENIE	Three!

MADS	It's the God Squad, bitch!

ADDY	That's right!

QUEENIE	Oh!

QUEENIE	Ooh!

QUEENIE	Tuff!

QUEENIE	So, you believe in Jesus?

QUEENIE	Jesus is just a statue.

MADS	Go!

QUEENIE	He's made as a cruel construct,

QUEENIE	by these old white males who are so vulnerable,

QUEENIE	so weak. You better

QUEENIE	keep me dead, or I'm gonna sing.

QUEENIE	Joy to the world

QUEENIE	The nuns are fucked

MADS	Will you just shut the fuck up?

MADS	Okay, well, I'll admit. Maybe another

MADS	one of those

MADS	potentially excessive overreactions,

MADS	but hey, whatever!

MADS	It's just me over here doing some of God's dirty work.

MADS	And come on, someone had to shut that bitch up.

SONG	I'm all out of hope

SONG	One more bad break could bring a fall
SONG	When I'm far from home, don't call me on the phone

SONG	To tell me you're alone, oh

SONG	It's easy

SONG	To deceive

SONG	It's easy to tease

SONG	But hard to get release

MADS	Sunny invited us all to stay,

MADS	but if this was my first step into my born-again virginity,

MADS	I wanted to start fresh across the board.

MADS	That means sayin' goodbye to my girls.

MADS	Instead of turning everybody into the police

MADS	for impersonating nuns,

MADS	Sister Julie made them pay penance to the church…

MADS	which I hear is a pretty shit fine.

MADS	I also heard the church got a new priest too.

MADS	Apparently, after our carnal encounter,

MADS	Father Sexy Pants had a crisis of faith.

MADS	He gave up the priesthood

MADS	and decided to take up male modeling.

MADS	Yeah, it really suits him too.

MADS	And, as for me…

MADS	Well… as for me,

MADS	you weren't done with me yet.

MADS	I don't know if the father is Eric, that priest,

MADS	or fuck, could be anyone else.

MADS	All I know is, sweet Lord Jesus,

MADS	you brought me to this City of Angels for a purpose,

MADS	and now, I'm off to spread your light.

MADS	I love you, Jesus.

MADS	Jesus is coming!
