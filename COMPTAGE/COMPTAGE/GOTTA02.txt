WINNY WIN	KOT dammit!!!

NOLA	The Black Female Form. Wide-Hipped and Honey-Dipped under the Sun and under the constant gaze of...Men..y, Meny.

NOLA	I’ve always wanted to paint Shemekka- that special brand of Brooklyn Brown. BK All Day. Never apologizing for the Suck of her Teeth, Snap of her Neck or how she moves the Black Female Form through the World: Zero. Fucks. Given.

NOLA	Shemekka. She’s Silky. I’mKinky. I’m Pinot Noir. She’s Moscato. But that’s my Girl for Life. True, Shemekka comes off like a tough Crown Heights Goddess but aren’t the tough ones always extra soft on the inside? 

NOLA	The Black Female Form. I’ve grown protective of it...my foolish attempt to control The Gaze of Gawkers who think The Black Female Form is here simply for their Consumption. Their Scrutiny, their Enjoyment, their grabbing Hands when all The Black Female Form wants is to be ... Free.

SHEMEKKA	‘Member? 2006! Crown Heights House party! Mad Niggas! DJ was Fiyah! Was like a damn Ernie Barnes paintin’ in there! I was ‘whinin’, KILLIN’ it on the Dance floor, when this crazy Broad spilled her drink on me!

NOLA	I did not! You bumped into me!

SHEMEKKA	I almost Bust Dat Ass! But I took Mercy on you and look at us now!

NOLA	Okay! Enough memories Dance Hall Queen!

SHEMEKKA	Make me amazing so Nadia’s fahvah see what he missing. 

SHEMEKKA	What? I’m serious. Pussy hole ack like I’m crazy cuz I don’t want my chile around his Big-Booty-havin’- Freak-of-Da-Week.

NOLA	Freak of the week? Didn’t they move in together?

SHEMEKKA	So. It ain’t official ‘til she take his last name. Even then, my dawtah is NOT be callin’ that Bitch Mommy! Ooh. Maybe the Painting is my Lil Fuck you Housewarming Gift, right? Lemme see.

NOLA	Not yet.

SHEMEKKA	“Not yet”. I finally get painted by the One and Only Nola Darling and she won’t let me see Da Shit that’s gonna make a nigga wish he aint jet for no Big Booty bitch!
NOLA	You need to Cut It. You might wanna Iyanla-fix that anger. I told you this painting is for my portfolio. I’m submitting it for the Catlett Prize.

SHEMEKKA	The What-let Prize?

NOLA	Elizabeth Catlett. It’s a Grant for Visual Artists. They tend to go for feminist work. Hence the Portrait. They only pick Three Artists for it and it’s Fifteen Stacks if they pick me.

SHEMEKKA	Wow.

NOLA	But I can’t get picked if your Ass don’t sit still.

SHEMEKKA	Fine! Just remember to...

NOLA	...I know! Long and Silky. I got you.

SHEMEKKA	Good. Can’t get my Silky sewn ‘til next week. Winny be givin’ me Umpteen jobs to do but be one damn Check. Shit, maybe when you get your Fifteen Gs...

NOLA	...Hahaha! Nope! IF I get it, I’m paying Five months rent and painting allll damn Day and Night. I’m so tired of this Hustle. Would you keep still!

NOLA	Do you know Primary Colors?

JIMMY	Yellow, Red, Blue

NOLA	What does Red and Yellow make? Orange ...

SHEMEKKA	Well, you can always be ‘Artistic’ down at the Hot-N-Trot! Owwww!

SHEMEKKA	Cramp?

SHEMEKKA

NOLA	This is where he grabbed me.

SHEMEKKA	Fuck. Bad enough he bruised you. You got Cloves?

NOLA	In the Cabinet. I mean, I’ve put Ice on it... 

SHEMEKKA	Sit down.

NOLA	Mekka I need to finish...

SHEMEKKA	...NOW!

SHEMEKKA	We gotta preserve that Hand, Ma! That’s Fideen Stacks right there!

SHEMEKKA	Seriously. You okay? You ain’t said nuffin’ since it happened.

NOLA	I’m Fine. It’s like I told Clo, I’ve moved on. 

SHEMEKKA	Mm hm.

NOLA	I have.

SHEMEKKA	You tell dese Dudes you seein’ what happened to you?

NOLA	I will. Eventually.

SHEMEKKA	Just tell ‘em! If they’re more than just some Jump offs, dey should know what happened!

NOLA	It’s not finished.

SHEMEKKA	Wow. Shemekka is taken back. It really is stunning.

NOLA	Beautiful, huh?

SHEMEKKA	That’s Me? Wow. Look at my Eyes... 

NOLA	....What?

SHEMEKKA	You couldn’t make my Ass a Lil’ bigger?

NOLA	What? No. I already agreed to the Fake Phantom Weave...

SHEMEKKA	....Nola I agreed to pose for you, the least you could do...

NOLA	...is paint something realistic.

SHEMEKKA	What da Fuck dat mean? Nola, did I make a mistake confidin’ a certain bit of information to you? No but...

SHEMEKKA	...’Cuz if I knew you’d be all Judge-y and Shit...

NOLA	...wait. You’re not going through with it?

SHEMEKKA	I told you- I’m seriously thinkin’ ‘bout it. Look it ain’t like I said I was signin’ up to go on ‘She Ass’d For It’!


CASH & AUDIENCE	SHE! ASS’D! FOR! IT!

CASH	TV’s ONLY competition where Contestants can compete for a complete BOOTY OVERHAUL like Season Two Winner, Jubilee Joooones!

JUBILEE	Thanks, Cash! Since winnin’ She Ass’d For It...I got engaged to a Baller, booked the Cover of ASSpirations Men’s Magazine and was able to move my Mama out Da Projects! Good.

SHEMEKKA	What? Don’t make that Face. I said I wasn’t gonna do it.

SHEMEKKA	The Show, I mean.

NOLA	Oh God. You don’t need to do Shit to your Body!

SHEMEKKA	That ain’t up to you Boo.

NOLA	But you’re already Gorgeous!

SHEMEKKA	I never said I wasn’t! I just....Wait, you mean to tell me, if I had a Magic wand and  could change anything ‘bout your body, you wouldn’t want nuffin’ tweaked?

NOLA	Nope.

SHEMEKKA	Blood Clot.

NOLA	I’m serious. I accept what I got and don’t got.

SHEMEKKA	Well I gots NO ASS, okay!? Me uh come from Yard, Land of Big Batty Gyal but God took my Damn Jamaican Birfright.

NOLA	What happened to doing Squats?

SHEMEKKA	If one more person tells me to do squats... It’s not enough! If you have a Flat Ass like I do then Squats gonna just make it Flatter.

NOLA	It just seems...so unnecessary. To you!

NOLA	I mean, what about Nadia?

SHEMEKKA	What about her?

NOLA	I mean it’s hard en ough for little Black Girls out here being told they’re ugly or not pretty enough. How do you know you changing your  body won’t make Nadia think something’s wrong with hers?

SHEMEKKA	...She’s too young to even notice! Look I said I was thinkin’ ‘bout it Nola but if you can’t be my Friend and support me...

NOLA	...Mekka. Stop. We’re Friends. Okay?! I don’t agree with this Shit but you’re My Girl...

NOLA	...From Womb to Tomb.


SHEMEKKA	From Birth to Earth.

SHEMEKKA	And you had better not tell Clo Neevah! 

NOLA	I won’t!

SHEMEKKA	Do not need her Nosy, Uppity Ass in my Biz!

WINNY WIN	Intro

PUNDO	Hey Honey! Boy what a great Crowd.I don’t usually allow touchin’ but Eddie. The Poor Guy doesn’t have hands so it doesn’t count, right?

SHEMEKKA	Ain’t you charitable?


GREER	HA! She was Rail Thin and thought she was fat!

NOLA	HA! This was a Black Girl?

GREER	Yup. HUH! French Black. 

NOLA	Huuuuuh!

GREER	Come on! Take this seriously, I get paid to do this. It could save your Life one day!

NOLA	Okay. Sorry.

GREER	Huh! Good Form, Nola.

NOLA	Huh! Thanks!

NOLA	Really, Greer?

GREER	Ha! Wait. Is there something you don’t like about yourself?

NOLA	Ha! Well ...

GREER	... You got some Big Ass Feet.

GREER	No but....nice right.

GREER	Ha! The three things you do when someone grabs you. One: Trap. Two: Lock. Three: Twist.

GREER	I may tease you about putting on some Muscle Mass but I honestly don’t think anything is wrong with your Body. You’re Beautiful.

GREER	Ha! I grab you. Trap, Lock, Twist.

NOLA	Ha! Trap, Lock, Twist. Huh!

NOLA	Huh! You’re a pretty good teacher.

GREER	In that case, class dismissed.

SEPTIMA	I was understudying the fabulous S. Epatha Merkerson in the Broadway debut of Piano Lesson. It was closing and looked like I’d never Get On. Well, one night, after a show, we go out for drinks. I was probably pouting about not going on, when this Tall, Cocoa-Colored Man walks up to me and says...

STOKELY	“Gem, with these very Music Making hands, I’d build a Stage just to see you on it!” Swept you off ya feet!

SEPTIMA	That is not what you said!

STOKELY	Yeah it is!

SEPTIMA	That’s NOT how it happened Stokes!

STOKELY	Don’t matter How or What! Point is we been together ever since. And I wouldn’t change a Day with this Ageless Beauty.

STOKELY	Can you believe My Queen is...

SEPTIMA	...an Actress never tells her age but do I look old enough to be the Mother of a now 27-Year-Old Woman?

STOKELY	Just yesterday I was bouncing Nola at my knee to Miles Davis. Now she’s got her own place, got her ideas, her own Money...


SEPTIMA/STOKELY	...Naw! Uh uh. Nope. No she don’t... (that’s pushing it.)

SEPTIMA	But our Nola is her own person now. A Beautiful Black Woman. Making Powerful Art. I’d like to think growing up in a home with Artists inspired that.

STOKELY	Damn straight. We ain’t have a lot but were creative in how we raised her. “No, Nola baby we don’t eat GUBMENT cheese. We eat REPARATIONS cheese!”

SEPTIMA	I do worry sometimes. Worry how things will turn out for her. Hoping she won’t have to struggle as much as we did.

STOKELY	What’s wrong with Struggle? Black Folk master it! Struggle makes Great Music, Art, and Literature builds character baby.

SEPTIMA	No mother wants her Child to  struggle or suffer or end up alone.I just hope she’ll one day meet her own Stokely, ya know, so she  doesn’t have to go through thisLife alone.

STOKELY	...That’s in God’s Hands, Gem.

NOLA	Mmm! Delicious as per usual, Stokes!

STOKELY	Better be! The Good Lord provides, but y’know how much I had to pay  for these Damn Steaks?! Man, Fuck these Newbie Motherfuckers and the’re inflation bringing asses!

SEPTIMA	Stokes is still a Lil’ salty. Someone popped up offering to buy our Brownstone. 

NOLA	Again?

STOKELY	Like, what part of “Fuck Off” don’t they get? I ain’t leavin’. No matter how much Money you got in that brief case. You know, they sellin’ Brownstones now for...

SEPTIMA/NOLA	...“20 times what we paid in  1978!?”

STOKELY	Tease if you want. Broken Record scratches the Needle, Baby.

SEPTIMA	And how are things with you, Hun?  Anything new or exciting?

NOLA	No! No, I mean, things are good. I’m applying for some Grants.

SEPTIMA	GREAT! So you’re okay with money?

NOLA	I’m okay. I’m still teaching on the side. I mean, it doesn’t pay a whole lot but it pays the Bills.

STOKELY	All us Artists gotta Work, Baby.

SEPTIMA	Our poor Lil’ Darling. We shoulda made you go to Med School, so you wouldn’t have to scrounge like your Artsy Fartsy Father and Me.  Mom stop.

NOLA	...I’m working on a new Piece...

NOLA	It’s not finished yet but...

SEPTIMA	...Wow! Woo! Stokes, you see this?

STOKELY	Woah! Mmmm. Powerful, Baby! Whatchu call that?

NOLA	The Free Black Female Form.

STOKELY	Free Black Female Form, Huh? Mm! She Free Alright! Stokes!

SEPTIMA	

STOKELY	I’m just sayin’... No doubt my Baby got God in her Fingers. 

NOLA	Thanks Dad. Just need to finish the Hair.

SEPTIMA	Let me guess, some Fake Indian, Chinese, Cambodian shit?

NOLA	Mom. She’s just expressing herself.

SEPTIMA	I don’t get you Two. You’re so...and Shemekka seems... 

NOLA	...Like one of my best Friends who’s just expressing herself.

SEPTIMA	Baby, expressing herself would be interchanging the Straight with her own Hair. You ever see her Natural Hair? 

SEPTIMA	See? Hiding all that Beautiful Brown, behind all that Weave.

NOLA	Maybe it’s her Armor. Is that so bad? To need a little something? We’ve all used things to Cope.

SEPTIMA 	A weave to Cope? Now how is that free?


JAMIE 	Hey Nola. You’re probably working. I know things are ... complicated for us right now. But you know we’re not done. I’m just...thinking about you. And I’m here. Alright. Have a Good Night.

PAPO	I got dat.

NOLA	Thanks, Papo. 

NOLA	Hold up.

NOLA	What you workin’ on these days?

PAPO	Yeah. Makin’ a new Piece from the trash discarded by New York’s One Percent. Callin’ it...The One Percent.

NOLA	Aahh. Dope. Here’s a gold coin. It’s good luck.

CAESAR	Ahhhhh! Ah Shit! My eyyyes! God whyyyyyyy!

NOLA	Fuck! I thought-

CAESAR	...I was gonna say I like iiiiiiit!

NOLA	Sorry! Thanks for the support!? 

RACHEL	Peace.

CLORINDA	Um. Peace.

RACHEL	Enjoyed the Class?



RACHEL	I loooove Pat Hall’s Dance and Movement Afro-Caribbean Class. It’s my favorite. Okay Nola, Sisters, see you next week. 

SHEMEKKA	Sistahs?

NOLA	Be nice. She’s Cool People. She lives upstairs from me.

SHEMEKKA	I bet Rachel only Fucks African Dudes. Seen any Mandingos comin’ outcha Brownstone?

SHEMEKKA	Knew it! I love Pat Hall’s Dance and Movement Afro-Caribbean Class.

CLORINDA	Danton wants to observe.

SHEMEKKA	Observe.....? 

CLORINDA	The Class.

NOLA	Sounds tantalizing; your Old Ass Boyfriend watching us do African Dance.

CLORINDA	First of all he’s only 52. Second, he’s NOT my Boyfriend.

SHEMEKKA	No, just some old White Dude watchin’ us shake our Black Booties!

SHEMEKKA	My Bad. We can’t all be like Nola datin’ Three Hot Single Black dudes at once!

CLORINDA	Hey, I like my Guy, okay? He treats me great and last time I checked, all of her Lovers WEREN’T single.

NOLA	Ugh! Clo, I told you. It’s complicated.

SHEMEKKA	Meaning?

NOLA	Meaning, Jamie takes good care of me and says his current situation is in...”Transition”. We’re trying to figure things out. I did tell him that Piece of Shit put His hands on Me.

NOLA	I told all of them.

SHEMEKKA	‘Bout time.

CLORINDA	How you doing? 

NOLA	I thought I was fine but I maced a Random Guy last night. 

CLORINDA	You what?!


SHEMEKKA	Son, You Macin’ Niggas in da Face?

NOLA	All he wanted was to say ‘nice work’ and PSSSHH! I send him screaming, crying down the street.

SHEMEKKA	Shit.

CLORINDA	Better him than you, right Nola? Aw come on! Admit it. Didn’t it feel good, letting one off? ... ... 

NOLA	Yes.

SHEMEKKA	Nola?

NOLA	Did I enjoy hurting an innocent Stranger, no? But if I’m being honest, it felt... 

CLORINDA	...Good...

NOLA	...Like Clapping back on what I thought was another Asshole trying to grab on me.

CLORINDA	Oh. My. God! Do you see this Shit?

CLORINDA	Who in their right mind...?

NOLA	... I know. Dumb Reality Shows.

CLORINDA	It’s not just the show. I mean, any woman who’s willing to alter her body is willing to affirm the male- gaze. And goodness, it’s so passe.

SHEMEKKA	Says the Girl with the Knock-Out Body. What?

SHEMEKKA	Why you always gotta be so Judgey?

NOLA	I don’t think she meant...

CLORINDA	Oh I meant it! I mean, how many steps back must we take? ‘She Ass’d For it’?! Bet a MAN came up with that shit! Ugh! You hear that? POW! Harriet Tubman turned the pistol onherself in the grave! Clo...

CLORINDA	No seriously! I mean what’s the  point of freeing our bodies if all we’re gonna do is carve them up?

NOLA	Isn’t free dom having the right to do what you will with your own body?

CLORINDA	I guess, but I bet Michelle Obama isn’t carving herself up. Naw! She’s too busy being unapologetically Black & Flyyyy! Am I lying?!

NOLA	Nope! She stays gowned up and tiiight! 

SHEMEKKA	I’m out.

NOLA	You don’t want to get smoothies?

SHEMEKKA	Y’all go ‘head. I gotta get Nadia before work. Later.

CLORINDA	What was that about?
