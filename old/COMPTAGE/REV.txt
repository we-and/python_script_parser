(BACK TO THE PAPER)



CHARLIE	What's going on? You're late.

MIKEY	Yeah, I'm here. Don't worry so much. It's gonna be okay.

CHARLIE	Okay. Okay.

MIKEY 	Eddie, what's wrong with this?

EDDIE	It doesn't work. So I hold down the fn and hit the f5, and the brightness starts to flicker...

MIKEY 	Computers. I thought they'd get me rich. I thought I'd create a killer app and retire before I was 20. Then get paid 200K a year giving bullshit talks about what it takes to be a success. Yeah, right. You know what I learned? No one truly succeeds without friends on top. And you know who's on top of any business? Fucking thieves. The point is, you don't get rich by following the rules. You gotta take what's yours.

EDDIE	...and the user mode 'cause I'm the user. And that's why I think its graphics card, and I still have warranty on it. So you guys gotta fix it.

MIKEY	I'm just gonna go to the back and see if we've another one. Your ride is so sick, bro. It's so sexy and shit. You know what I mean? I wish I had that. Nah, man. You shouldn't. And what is that? That's nothing. What are we doing here? We should be fucking striving for something more you know? Reaching for the fucking stars; not... not settling for what I have or what anybody else has.

SKITTLES	It's a simple life.

MIKEY	Nah. You don't get it, man.

EDDIE	It was that one.

MANAGER	I see. Thank you for your patience again. Sorry again.

EDDIE	Alright.

MANAGER	Have a great one. Cheers. What the heck, Mikey? Where'd you go?

MIKEY 	Smoke break.

MANAGER	You left the customer waiting!? What's wrong with you? That's the third customer complaint this week. Do you even want to be here? Mikey! Hello? 

MIKEY 	Hold on, I'm thinkin'.

MANAGER	Get out!

SONG	I'm spending money Like I just got paid § Hundred-dollar bills Tell 'em keep the change § Come on

MIKEY	You know that moment in your life when everything is coming together, everything is clicking...it's all going according to plan?

SONG	Let me give you Something now to celebrate

MIKEY	That's exactly the opposite of how I felt. Anyway, fuck it, I had a new plan.

SONG	And if you're wondering Why I move the way I do § I just feel so good § Good good § Oh I just feel so good § Good good § Oh I just feel so good § Good good § Oh I just feel so good § Good good § Oh I just feel so good § Good good § Oh I just feel so good § Good good § I just feel so good

MIKEY	Rick, or Maserati Rick as we call him, is the first guy I ever stole a car for.

MASERATI RICK 	Hey, Mikey.

MIKEY 	He runs Good Guys Motorsports in the worst part of the city. If you want something done fast and cheap, Rick's your guy. If you want quality, you better look elsewhere.

MASERATI RICK 	Look what happened! The fucking shift knob came off again. I must have threaded it three times and it keeps comin' off.

MIKEY	Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?

MASERATI RICK 	Yeah, sure. What's up, kid?

MIKEY	I need cash.

MASERATI RICK 	How come every time I see you, you're broke?

MIKEY	I got expensive taste.

MASERATI RICK 	You shouldn't overextend yourself.

MIKEY	Look, I was hoping that maybe I could, uh, help you cop a few cars.

MASERATI RICK 	Sure. I like when you help me out, kid.

MIKEY	No. Look, I mean, like a lot of cars. Like a lot, a lot.

MASERATI RICK 	Okay. What are we talking about? One a week?

MIKEY	How about one a day?

MASERATI RICK 	Oh, come on, kid. I wish I could. I can't move that many cars.

MIKEY	Why not?

MASERATI RICK 	You know how it is. You need a fence; you need a network. I just don't have those kind of connections. Besides, I just make money from parts. Okay. Look, why don't we try this? Let's do two a week, and we'll take it from there. Alright?

MIKEY	Yeah. Okay. Alright.

MASERATI RICK 	Okay.

MIKEY 	I was 15 years old when I stole my first car. and my friend, Donny, skipped school and spent the entire day looking for cars to steal. We had just watched Gone in 60 Seconds. I got one message for society: If you don't want to encourage crime, stop making movies about it. The moment I saw that ugly, gray Toyota Corolla, I knew it was the one.
	
15-YEAR-OLD MIKEY	Yo!

MIKEY 	I don't know why, but somehow, I knew that the keys would be in the glove box. But that wasn't the craziest thing I'd ever done.

POLICEMAN 	What're you doing? Wait! Wait!

15-YEAR-OLD MIKEY	What are you gonna do?

MIKEY 	Can you believe I got away with it?

15-YEAR-OLD MIKEY	What are you gonna do?

MIKEY 	Well, you shouldn't. That was the first time I ever stole a police car, but it wouldn't be my last. Rick was in the market for certain types of cars. Evos, Subarus, Acuras; that type of thing. Or perhaps, something like this. Forged rims, check. Upgraded exhaust, check. Boost gauges; probably means there's a supercharger or a turbo installed. That's the ticket. Step One: Buy a slide hammer. Step Two: Blow the ignition and get the hell out of there. Step Three: Profit. How long have you been working on this thing?

MASERATI RICK	Still working out the kinks.

MIKEY 	Guess what I saw the other day.

MASERATI RICK	What?

MIKEY 	A 1965 Shelby GT Cobra.

MASERATI RICK	What? Not an original?

MIKEY 	Yeah, an original.

MASERATI RICK	I tell you, Mikey, you get me something like that, we can make some real money. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

MIKEY 	Are you serious?

MASERATI RICK	Yeah, you interrupted me. I didn't count properly.

MIKEY 	One of the easiest ways to steal someone's car...is to simply take their keys while they're asleep.

SKITTLES	What is it?

MIKEY	That's a 1965 Shelby GT Cobra,  just like from Bad Boys.

SKITTLES	One or Two?

MIKEY	What do you mean?

SKITTLES	Is the car from Bad Boys I or II?

MIKEY	There is no Bad Boys I. There's a Bad Boys and a Bad Boys II. Look, you don't enumerate the first one, alright?

SKITTLES	Whatever. It's probably a replica.

MIKEY	Nah, I did my homework.

SKITTLES	So, what do you want from me?

MIKEY	What do you mean? You're gonna help me break into the place.

SKITTLES	No! No, no, no. Fuck that. I'm-- I'm on probation, man. I'm not helping you break into shit.

MIKEY	Skittles, man, do you know how much that car is worth? I'll give you 10 percent.

SKITTLES	Nope.

MIKEY	15 percent.

SKITTLES	 Why do you wanna do this here, man? Why not just wait until he takes it out?

MIKEY	Are you serious? That car hasn't moved from that spot in two weeks. You don't just take a million-dollar car and drive it around the city and park it at a fucking grocery store?

SKITTLES	A million dollars?

MIKEY	More like 500g's. You know what I mean though, right?

SKITTLES	I'll retire in Miami. Just like in Bad Boys I.

MIKEY	Fine. Here, this is for you.

SKITTLES	Wait, why, wait. Why, why don't I get the same one as yours?

MIKEY	Man, that's all they had.

SKITTLES	Oh my God! Have you ever broken into a house before?

MIKEY	No. That's why I brought you along.

SKITTLES	This fucking stands out!

MIKEY	Well, do you have your own mask?

SKITTLES	No.

MIKEY	It's gonna look fine on you. You'll look great. Okay. Let's fucking go, man.

SKITTLES	Fuck, man! This is why I don't like doing work with fucking white people.

MIKEY	Come on, let's go.

SKITTLES	I can do it. Alright, got it.

MIKEY 	I never understand why people leave their cars keys near the front door. Might as well leave them in the car.

SKITTLES	Alright, I'm out.

MIKEY	What?

SKITTLES	That's it, I helped you get in.

MIKEY	No, no, no, no, no. That's not it. I need you.

SKITTLES	For what?

MIKEY	Push!

SKITTLES	I'm fucking pushing!

MIKEY	Push harder.

SKITTLES	Fuck you! Alright? I'm pushing!

MIKEY	Fuck!

SONG	I get too deep sometimes In my own head § Unstitch the fabric to find A common thread § Got caught up in the hustle And forgot to love § Woke up in the rubble To a light from above § Racing to the ends Of the earth § I know I'm probably Not the first § But I'm gonna be The last one standing § Ain't gonna dream Just demand it 

MIKEY	When you steal a high-end car, what you wanna do is let it cool off in a public space and come back to it a week later. That way, if the car is being tracked, it won't be waiting for you when you return.

OFFICER 2	Don't fucking move!

OFFICER 3	Get your hands in the air!

OFFICER 4	Get out of the car!

OFFICER 3	Get your hands in the fucking air! Now!

OFFICER 4	Come on! Get your hands in the air!

OFFICER 3	Get out of the car!

OFFICER 4 	Higher! Higher!

MIKEY	So I guess the car was being tracked after all.

OFFICER KOVITZ	You've got some nerve stealing from me on Shabbat.

MIKEY	Oh, that was yours? See, I didn't know, but um... Shalom, by the way.

OFFICER KOVITZ	You want me to believe this was a coincidence? With your history of stealing cop cars?

MIKEY	I mean, who would've thought that a cop could afford an authentic Shelby Cobra, right? What do you guys make? Get me a job here.

OFFICER KOVITZ	That was an inheritance from my father in-law, you prick. He passed away last year.

MIKEY	My condolences. Honestly. Evening, Mikey. I'm Det. Reid from the Toronto Police Auto Squad and it looks like you're being charged with grand theft auto, of a 1965 Shelby GT Cobra with a value well over $200,000. Whewwwww! Nice car.

OFFICER KOVITZ	Thank you.

DET. REID 	Hmm... let's see what else we got. Ah, you're also being charged with home invasion, an indictable offence, which carries a maximum life sentence. Now, this sentence is rarely if ever enforced, but for you, Mikey, we're gonna make an exception.

MIKEY 	That was bullshit.

DET. REID 	This is no bullshit, Mikey. We are talking some serious real time in prison. Yes, you can fight it, and we'll appeal. We can go back and forth, but trust me, we are going to do everything we can to make your life a living hell. And given your history, shouldn't be that difficult, right?

OFFICER KOVITZ 	Absolutely.

MIKEY	Alright. Why do you guys have such a hard on for me? 'Cause I stole from Moses over here? Listen, I didn't know. I swear to God.

DET. REID 	Maybe you didn't know. Maybe it was an honest mistake. What do you think, Officer Kovitz? Is there some kind of way that we can work somethin' out?

OFFICER KOVITZ	I might have some ideas.

MIKEY 	Their idea was for me to become an agent and infiltrate one of the biggest car theft rings in the city. They wanted me to steal a Lamborghini which belonged to the ring leader and bring it to a chop shop on 44th Street.

SONG	We gotta take it slow § Here comes the fever § Here comes the fever now § One two go We gotta take it slow Here comes the fever  Here comes the fever now One two go We gotta take it slow Here comes the fever § Here comes the fever now

MECHANIC ROY	Hey, bring her up. Come on. Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop! Okay. Look, just, just leave it there. You Mikey?

MIKEY	Who else would I be?

MECHANIC ROY	Look, I called him. He's gonna be here in about 30 minutes. Oh, you know the plan, right?

MIKEY	Yeah, they told me.

MECHANIC ROY	Okay, good. So... how long have you known me for?

MIKEY	I don't know, two years.

MECHANIC ROY	No, three. It says here three years. Three years.

MIKEY	Alright, three. Fuck.

MECHANIC ROY	Yeah, three. What kind of cars do you steal for me?

MIKEY	S-Class Mercedes mostly. Uh, high-end luxury cars.

MECHANIC ROY	Okay. Good, good, good, good. Okay. You nervous? Don't be nervous.

MIKEY	I'm good, man.

MECHANIC ROY	Okay. Look, I, I see you got a bit of an attitude, alright? Don't get cocky with Charlie. He doesn't like that. I just need this to go smooth, okay? Just be cool.

MIKEY	Smoothly.

MECHANIC ROY	Huh?

MIKEY	Smooth-- You want this to go smoothly.

MECHANIC ROY	Look, fuck. Hey, Charlie. Yeah, yeah. He's here, it's here. You out front? Okay. I'll, I'll, I'll come get you. Just hang on a minute. Okay. Okay. Be there in five. Shit. I really need to go to the bathroom.

MIKEY	You might want to put that away.

MECHANIC ROY	Huh? Ah, shit! Hi. See? I went over it, I gave it a full inspection. Everything is in tiptop shape.

CHARLIE	It's dirty.

MECHANIC ROY	Ugh, we'll wash it.

CHARLIE	You better.

MECHANIC ROY	Everything.

CHARLIE	Alright. So is this the guy?

MECHANIC ROY	Yeah. This is Mikey. I, I told him it belonged to you. He-- He didn't know.

CHARLIE	Is that true?

MIKEY	Yeah.

CHARLIE	So how'd you do it? Roy told me you even disabled the LoJack?

MIKEY	Basic, really. I used a radio hack to catch the wave signal when you were locking your car, and then I just played it back to unlock the doors.

CHARLIE	A code grabber?

MIKEY	Yeah, a RollJam.

CHARLIE	Go on.

MIKEY	I plugged in a custom ECU into the diagnostic port, disabled the anti-theft, and then all I had to do after that was upload a pirate software.

CHARLIE	Who programmed the software?

MIKEY	I did.

CHARLIE	You? What are you, some kinda engineer?

MIKEY	Yeah. I know some code. Look, are we done here? I said I was sorry. I gave you back your car. Can I go now?

CHARLIE	You didn't say you were sorry.

MIKEY	Alight. Well, I'm sorry.

CHARLIE	Roy, where'd you find this guy?

MECHANIC ROY	Oh he...He stole my car two years ago. Three years ago.

CHARLIE	Keep in touch.

MECHANIC ROY	We good?

CHARLIE	Yeah. What happened?

MECHANIC ROY	Okay, good.

MIKEY 	And just like that, I was in. You gotta admire a guy like Charlie. He was a hustler, a dreamer, a go-getter. Not even 30 yet, he had his own shop, warehouse, and distribution network. Charlie had a small team of thieves who were notorious for stealing high-end luxury vehicles throughout the GTA. Charlie's operation was like nothing I'd ever seen before. It was organized, proper, meticulous. During the day, it was the usual; insurance claims, body repair, that kind of thing. But at night, that's when the real work began.

CHARLIE	Alright. Strip it down, boys.

MIKEY	His crew could strip an entire X5 in under two hours. Fucking brilliant.

CHARLIE	Are you serious? That's, that's two guys this week.

AVA	He wasn't doing a good job, Charlie.

CHARLIE	Oh God!

AVA	I...

CHARLIE	You know he's suicidal?

MIKEY	Charlie?

AVA	What!

MILEY	Sorry, Charlie?

CHARLIE	Yeah.

MIKEY	Um, the S-Class is here. Do you want me to bring it around?

CHARLIE	Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course.

AVA	The S-Class.

CHARLIE	Hey Mikey, get over here for a second. Have you met Ava?

MIKEY	Hi.

CHARLIE	Ava, Mikey. Mikey, Ava.

AVA 	Yeah, I've seen him around.

CHARLIE	Look, I want you to be nice to Mikey. He's a smart kid.

AVA 	But I'm nice to everyone.

CHARLIE	Seriously, I wanna keep him around a while.

AVA 	Okay. Well, if you like him so much, Charlie, then why don't you invite him to your party tonight?

CHARLIE	Yeah?

MIKEY	What party?

CHARLIE	Mikey! I'm over here. Come over here. Have a seat. Sit down.

AVA	Hi, Mikey.

CHARLIE	Is that for me?

MIKEY	Uh, yeah. Uh, I thought I should get you something. Happy Birthday, man.

CHARLIE	Oh my God! Look at this, huh? You see this? You see this? That's character. Thank you. Alright, let's get this party started! You got a little something for us, darling?

AVA	I do. Come on, Mikey.

SAMMY	What the fuck? Come here! You fucking monkey. Come here! What do you see?

MECHANIC	A great fucking job.

SAMMY	A great fucking job? Fucking look at that panel! There's a massive gap!

MIKEY	Who's that?

SAMMY	Do it again. This time, no gap.

CHARLIE	That's my business partner, Sammy.

SAMMY	Hey, Charlie!

CHARLIE 	Sammy, you can't yell at him like that. Man, we talked about this. Come on.

SAMMY	Ah, don't be such a pussy. Come here. People will take advantage of you.

CHARLIE 	Yeah, whatever.

SAMMY	Who's this?

CHARLIE 	Uh, this is Mikey.

MIKEY	Hey, nice to meet you.

SAMMY	Customs pulled me over. I missed my connecting flight. Can you believe that?

CHARLIE 	Why didn't you call me?

SAMMY	What are you? My mother? I was taking care of something.

CHARLIE	Sammy just got back from West Africa. Where did you go again, Zimbabwe?

SAMMY	Ghana, Charlie. Zimbabwe is in Southern Africa. Why don't you open a book sometime, you little fucker?

CHARLIE	Ah.

MIKEY 	Sammy was a piece of shit thug who hated me from day one. He was the type of guy who wouldn't even piss on you if you were on fire.

GUY	Move it! You can't park there. Hey! Can you move your car? What?

SAMMY	You little fucker! Fuck! This is it.

CHARLIE	This is massive, Sammy.

SAMMY	Yeah. What do you expect? The guy's a fucking millionaire.

MIKEY	I'm gonna take a piss.

SAMMY	What's the deal with him?

CHARLIE	He's cool, man.

SAMMY	How long have you known him for?

CHARLIE	Don't worry about Mikey. I trust him. Just tell me about the deal.
	
SAMMY	You know not all thieves can be trusted, Charlie.

CHARLIE	How's it gonna work?

SAMMY	We get a list every week. We steal the cars, we get it through customs, they handle the shipping and delivery, we get paid; simple as that.

CHARLIE	Okay. What's his name?

SAMMY	Nah, we'll talk about it later.

CHARLIE	No, no, no. I wanna talk about it now. Who is he?

SAMMY	I don't fucking know this guy.

CHARLIE	I'm vouching for Mikey. Tell me his fucking name.

SAMMY	His name is Koflex. But let me tell you, Charlie, this is going to change everything. He's got multiple buyers, and they're all flush. Ministers, politicians, warlords. They all have very exotic tastes.

CHARLIE	Like what?

SAMMY	Lamborghinis, Ferraris, McLarens, Jags, everything. Anything. It's not just a country, Charlie. It's an entire fucking region; all of West Africa. It's gonna be ours.

CHARLIE	How much are we talking about here?

SAMMY	Umm, fucking millions. So like, you're telling me you've never been in a threesome?

GIRL	No. It's not really my...

SAMMY	What are you? Some fucking Victorian nun?

GIRL	Ugh.

CHARLIE	Hey! Mikey. Boys, we're going to be every insurance company's worst fucking nightmare!

SAMMY	Fucking right!

CHARLIE	Fuck 'em!

ALL	Fuck 'em!

CHARLIE	Ugh, Mikey, I want you to know you're-- you're part of something big. We're expanding the business, and I want you to be my right-hand guy.

MIKEY	Charlie, I don't know what to say, man. That's...

CHARLIE	Don't say anything, alright?

DUTCH 	Charlie!

CHARLIE	What's up, Dutch?

DUTCH 	Is that how you treat a friend?

CHARLIE	What do you mean?

DUTCH 	What do I mean?

SAMMY	Why don't you fuck off, Dutch? Huh? Koflex works with us now.

DUTCH	Shut the fuck up, Sammy. I expect this shit from you. But you? You go behind my back after all the fucking money that I made you?

CHARLIE	It's just business, Dutch. Come on.

DUTCH	Koflex was my contact.

SAMMY	Yeah? Well, he's ours now. So why don't you take your janky ass chain and get the fuck outta here?

CHARLIE	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sammy, Sammy, Sammy, relax, okay. Hey, maybe we can work something out?

DUTCH	Ain't shit to work out, bro!

CHARLIE	Come on.

DUTCH	Look, Africa...is mine.

CHARLIE	Don't worry about it, Sammy. We're going to work it out, okay?

SAMMY	I'm not worried. And you're goddammed right we're gonna work it out. I didn't sweat my balls off in that malaria-infested hell hole for nothing. Charlie? You see? That's what happens.

MIKEY 	That was the thing about Charlie. He loved that girl to death.

DET. REID	Sammy. Sammy what?

MIKEY	I don't know. I never got a last name.

DET. REID	Tell me about this deal again.

MIKEY	[inhales] They want to move 50 cars a month. Charlie put me in charge of exotic cars.

DET. REID	Where? Africa?

MIKEY	Yeah, Ghana.

DET. REID	Okay, so who's the fence?

MIKEY	His name is Koflex. A "fence" is a person who buys stolen goods and re-sells them. He's basically a sales rep, a middle man, a way for Charlie to get his stolen cars off the streets and onto the shores of Africa.

KOFLEX	Yes.

DUTCH	Koflex.

KOFLEX	Dutch.

DUTCH	Brother, why you working with 'em White boys?

KOFLEX 	I need product, Dutch. My buyers don't care where it comes from.

DUTCH	Yeah, but why wouldn't you ask me?

KOFLEX 	Because I didn't think you can deliver.

DUTCH 	And who said that? Sammy? Those guys are fucking crooks. Look, you just tell me what you need, Koflex.

KOFLEX 	Alright. I need Ferraris.

DUTCH 	No problem!

KOFLEX	Ten of them.

DUTCH 	Sure.

KOFLEX 	A month.

DUTCH 	Okay.

KOFLEX 	My clients are not the kind of people you want to cross, Dutch. If you don't deliver, and they'll give your wife to the soldiers.

DUTCH 	Just break your deal with those crackers, man. I'll get you the fucking cars.

CHARLIE	I can't fucking believe this!

SAMMY	I told you! I told you that bastard was going to fuck to up our deal.

CHARLIE	Sammy, we're gonna go talk to him.

SAMMY	No, I'm fucking done talking, Charlie. You can't reason with these roaches. They gotta to learn to stay out of our business.

CHARLIE	Jesus, Sammy! We're not gonna kill the fuck.

SAMMY	Intimidation, Charlie. Here. You a part of this or not? Dutch! Get out here, you cunt. Back off! Dutch!

CHARLIE	Have a seat!

SAMMY	You couldn't keep your nose out of my fucking business, could you, Dutch?

DUTCH	It was my business, to begin with.

SAMMY	Yeah? Hey, Charlie.

CHARLIE	Hmm?

SAMMY	See that drill over there? Be a dear and hand that to me, please?

DUTCH	The fuck you gonna do with that shit? Huh?

SAMMY	You wanna fuck with us?

DUTCH	What the fuck... Arrgggghhh!!!

KOFLEX 	Yes, Dutch.

DUTCH 	Koflex, I can't get you the cars anymore.

KOFLEX 	Why not?

DUTCH 	It turns out I have a bit of a health problem.

KOFLEX 	Sorry to hear that, Dutch.

DUTCH 	I've thought about it and I think you're better off with Charlie and Sammy.

KOFLEX 	Okay. Feel better.

MIKEY	In sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Gambia, the demand for high-end cars was booming. Driven by cash rich drug dealers, corrupt politicians, and egotistical warlords, a brand-new McLaren was the ultimate status symbol. Most companies don't even set up shop in this part of the world. So, if you want the latest Porsche GT3 or Benz, you have to import. That's where we come in. Why spend 400K on a brand-new Huracan when you can get the same car for half the price. Charlie's operation ran like clockwork. Koflex sends us a list of in-demand cars, and we stole every single one of them. There are many ways to steal a car. The simplest being a good old-fashioned carjacking.

CARJACKER	Get out of the car! Get out of the car!

MIKEY 	Which I was never a fan of.

WOMAN	Okay.

CARJACKER	I will fucking shoot you. Get! Get the fuck out! Whooooo! Whooooo!

MIKEY 	There were dealership scams where we would ask for a test drive, snap a photo of the keys and create a replica later.

DEALER	This car—

MIKEY 	Then another one of us would come back pretending to be a customer and swap the keys. By the time the dealer realized they now had a fake set, the car was already in Charlie's warehouse. We even had people in the MTO who got us duplicate plates that matched the exact make, model, and color of the cars we stole. So if a cop ever spotted a runner and ran the plates, everything checked out.

POLICEMAN	Here you go, sir. Have a great day.

MIKEY 	And then, there was my specialty Hacking the car's anti-theft system, driving it underground where it became invisible to satellites, and taking my time to disable the tracking device.

SONG	I've gotta strike this chord With the humble hearts Bearing heavy chains And blue collar scars § Inevitably they're gonna Get their way If we don't take that fight Take it to the grave They try to walk With the angels In the city so fatal

MIKEY 	Next, came retagging.

SONG	So I fall into the flames

MIKEY 	We would forge new VIN numbers, vehicle history, and titles.

SONG	Don't knock my reckless ways

MIKEY	We had folders full of fake customs documents, manifests...

SONG	We'll be unbreakable Unmistakable

MIKEY 	everything you would need to make a car disappear.

SONG	Live in overdrive Three two one I wanna take you to A distant star And start a colony You know it doesn't matter Who we are We'll be the king and queen Different shade of Blue over me and you Brand new fear §

MIKEY 	Koflex couldn't be happier. Anything he wanted...

CHARLIE	Oh, my God!

MIKEY 	Charlie delivered.

SONG	Bring you on a ride Up in my rocket I just wanna fly With the windows down Bring you on a ride Got the world in my pocket Wanna take you high Never come back down §

MIKEY 	We were moving nearly one million dollars' worth of cars a month.

SONG	Riding on my rocket

MIKEY 	And if you're wondering what kind of lifestyle that affords,

SONG	Rocket rocket

MIKEY 	it's a great one.

SONG	Riding on my rocket Rocket rocket

AVA	Hey, Mikey. Pass me the towel?

MIKEY	Yeah.

KOFLEX	Sammy?

SAMMY	Hey.

KOFLEX	I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

SAMMY	Right now? Huh?

KOFLEX	Right now.

SAMMY	Alright.

KOFLEX	Sammy, did you look into it yet?

SAMMY	Not yet, not yet.

KOFLEX	I need to know soon, Sammy. I can't waste any more time.

SAMMY	I know, I know. I'm working on it.

KOFLEX	My buyers want to move on this as soon as possible. If you can't deliver, let me know now. Don't drag this out.

SAMMY	I can deliver. I just need a little time. Just give me 'til next week.

KOFLEX	Hmm. Next week.

AVA	You know, Charlie really likes you, Mikey.

MIKEY	Yeah. I like him too, as a friend of course. I mean, he's all yours.

AVA	But seriously, he really trusts you.

MIKEY	Yeah, I know.

AVA	We'll have to be careful.

CHARLIE	Boom! Hey, uh, have you guys seen Sammy?

MIKEY	Uh no.

CHARLIE	He's always running off, that Sammy. He's like the fucking road runner, you know?

AVA	Can you pass me that magazine, love?

CHARLIE	You believe this? This is what she reads, Drifting. Honestly, you see a girl like this, a car magazine is the last thing you expect her to be reading, right?

AVA	Why don't you just be honest with yourself, Charlie, and admit that you hate drifting and you hate drift cars?

CHARLIE	I do, I do. I hate them!

MIKEY	Why?

CHARLIE	Sliding around, burning tires. It's a stupid waste of money.

MIKEY	Nah, I disagree. No. Drifting is, it's graceful. It's like dancing, you know? You have to improvise every single time you miss a step. It's chaotic, but precise. It's, it's poetry in motion.

AVA	Thank you.

MIKEY	I actually run laps at a track sometime. You guys should come.

CHARLIE	I'm not gonna watch you waste a good set of tires.

AVA	I'll come.

CHARLIE	Mikey, I'm telling you, she can come watch, but don't let her get behind the wheel. She sucks.

MASERATI RICK	Boost gauge, oil temperature, speed. Start off with the clutch kick, like we talked about. You can come in the turn at any speed that way. It will help to build your confidence nice and slow. Okay?

SONG	I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure You really are my ecstasy My real-life fantasy Oh yeah You really are my ecstasy My real-life fantasy Oh yeah Oooh You really are my ecstasy My real-life fantasy Oh yeah §

MASERATI RICK	She's fucking incredible.

MIKEY	Yeah.

MASERATI RICK	Is she your girl?

SONG	My real-life fantasy Oh yeah

MIKEY	Yeah.

SONG	You really are my ecstasy My real-life fantasy Oh yeah My real-life fantasy Oh yeah Oooh You really are my ecstasy §

AVA	There's nothing to eat in here.

MIKEY	Yeah, well, I've been busy. I had been busy alright. Between talking to the cops, keeping Sammy off my back, and stealing for Charlie, I had a lot on my plate. This was the last thing I needed. But that ass though...

AVA	I'm hungry.

MIKEY	Are you ready to go?

SONG	Are you happy with him I lay in my bed Staring at the ceiling §

MIKEY	Fuck!

AVA	What?

MIKEY	That was Sammy.

SONG	Trying hard to lose

SAMMY	One second.

AVA	Relax. We, we just had breakfast.

SONG	§ This empty empty feeling §

SAMMY	Well, well. What are you two doing here?

MIKEY	We just had breakfast.

AVA	We were actually just on our way to the scrap yard to get the new VIN numbers.

SAMMY	Is that a fact?

AVA	Mmm. What are you doing here, Sammy?

MIKEY	Are you working with Dutch again?

SAMMY	Dutch?

SONG	I can't help But wonder darling

SAMMY	No, we're just having breakfast.

AVA	Well, enjoy. We will see you later, Sammy.

SONG	Are you happy with him

SAMMY	You know, Charlie, he's not really a breakfast guy. Why don't we uh keep this place our little secret? We wouldn't want him to feel left out.

SONG	And oh how happy I was

SAMMY	Where were we?

DUTCH	I'm not helping you, Sammy.

SAMMY	And I'm not asking for your help I'm asking for your collaboration. Those are two different things. There's good money to be made here. Can you do it or not? Huh?

DUTCH	Can I do it?

SAMMY	Yeah.

SONG	Now that you've tried it

DUTCH	The cars...that's your thing. I admit that. But this is my territory. How do I know you won't fuck me?

SAMMY	You get your money upfront. No funny business. You know the drill.

SONG	Is everything he does

DUTCH	You better know what you're fucking doing, man. These guys know all the tricks, they know where to look. You can't just ship the product like that.

SAMMY	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck. You wince like a woman. Just get back to me when you have a number, okay?

DUTCH	And what about your partner?

SAMMY	Charlie? He'll come around.

SONG	But if you ever come back

MIKEY 	Hello?

CHARLIE	Where the fuck are you?

MIKEY 	I'm taking the Jag to the, to the yard, just like you said.

CHARLIE 	Oh, like I said? You were supposed to be there two fucking hours ago, you missed the shipment! Now, I gotta pay for an extra week of storage.

MIKEY 	I'm so sorry, Charlie.

CHARLIE 	You're sorry, I'm sorry, everybody's sorry. First Ava takes the day off out of the fucking blue, then Sammy disappears like he always does, and now you!

MIKEY 	I got tied up.

CHARLIE 	Oh, you're tied up? I feel like I'm running this entire operation by myself.

MIKEY 	Well, what can I do?

CHARLIE 	Just get the car over there and tell Gordie to store it for the next shipment.

MIKEY 	Whatever you want. Whatever you want, Charlie. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice. If I was better off keeping my day job. I'd be home right now playing video games instead of living in one. least then, I'd be able to turn it off.

DET. REID	What else did you see?

MIKEY	Nothing, right? That's it. Just Sammy, Koflex, and the drugs.

DET. REID	And Dutch was there too?

MIKEY	No. What, what would he be doing there?

DET. REID	But you did see him earlier?

MIKEY	Yeah, I did; at breakfast with Sammy. Are you guys following me?

OFFICER KOVITZ	Of course. Tell us more about the drugs. What was it? Meth, coke, heroin?

MIKEY	Man, I don't know! Alright? I don't know anything about drugs. Listen, I am done with this shit. This is not what I signed up for.

DET. REID	No, you're not. Look at me. You are an agent. You work for us.

MIKEY	I gave you everything that you wanted, alright? I don't know anything else. This is it; this is the operation. Just go in there and bust them already?

OFFICER KOVITZ	What you saw today was the operation. That's what we have been waiting for. You think we give a fuck about a car theft ring? Your buddies Charlie and Sammy are working with an international drug smuggler.

MIKEY	No, not Charlie.

DET. REID	Yes, Charlie.

MIKEY	No, alright? I know him. He wouldn't get involved with something like this.

DET. REID	You just keep your eyes open.

MIKEY	Are you crazy? I can't go back in there, alright? Sammy saw me. That guy's a fucking psychopath. He drills people's dicks, for Christ sake.

OFFICER KOVITZ	So you saw him with a little bit of coke. So what? You're Charlie's boy, aren't you? He wouldn't let anything happen to you.

MIKEY	I want out, alright? I want out. I've had enough. All I did was steal a fucking car.

DET. REID	I want to show you something. I got this thing, yeah, off of eBay and it is amazing. The pictures? So clear. Now, I'm not a professional and I barely know how to use it, but I am learning. Oh, look, see? That's my cat, Cali. Ooohh, so cute. And that? That one's a bird. Know how I took it? Oh, but these, I am so proud of these. It's a sunset, so beautiful. Check these out.

SAMMY	Why you following me, huh?

MIKEY	I'm not.

SAMMY	Yes, you are. Don't fucking lie to me. I saw you at the container yard.

MIKEY	Yeah, I was delivering a car for Charlie.

SAMMY	What'd you see?

MIKEY	Nothing. Just you and Koflex in the office.

SAMMY	What else? You know, I don't like you, Mikey. Not one little bit. But Charlie does. It would be a shame if something were to change his mind. You know what I mean? I found these on my way in. You might want to give these back to Ava. Coming! I'm coming! What! Hey. What's up, Charlie?

CHARLIE	Get your shit, let's go.

MIKEY 	Where we going?

CHARLIE	Don't ask questions, just hurry the fuck up.

MIKEY 	Yeah.

AVA	So, what are we doing here, Charlie? What's going on?

CHARLIE	You know, Sammy always told me I was too soft, that I trust a little too easily. You know what? Maybe, maybe he was right all along.

AVA	So what's happening? What's the problem?

CHARLIE	Why don't you tell us what the problem is, Michael?

MIKEY	I don't know what you mean.

CHARLIE	Yes, you do. Sammy told me everything. I just want to hear it from you.

MIKEY	What do you want me to say?

CHARLIE	I want you to tell me the truth. You've been going behind my back. What? Think I wasn't gonna find out, huh?

MIKEY	Charlie, man, I am so sorry. Okay? I made...

AVA	What are you sorry for, Mikey?

CHARLIE	I'll show you what he's sorry for.

AVA	What the fuck is that?

CHARLIE	Oh, that? That is Sammy and Mikey's new business. At least Sammy had the balls to come clean. How long were you gonna keep this a secret from me?

MIKEY	Charlie, look. I don't know...

CHARLIE	I don't think I can ever trust you again, Mikey. Whatever it is you guys got going on with Koflex, count me out. Ava, let's get the fuck out of here.

SAMMY	You can't do that, Charlie.

CHARLIE	What?

SAMMY	I said, you can't do that.

CHARLIE	You threatening me, Sammy?

SAMMY	No. It's not me you should be worried about.

CHARLIE	No?

SAMMY	No.

CHARLIE	Who should I be worried about then?

SAMMY	Well, the African fucking warlords, brother. Who do you think we're dealing with here, huh?

CHARLIE	What the fuck have you gotten us into, Sammy?

SAMMY	You wanted to expand, remember? We were gonna take over the world, you and me.

CHARLIE	Not like this.

SAMMY	Listen, if we don't give Koflex what he wants, it's gonna cost us a lot more than money. You feel me?

CHARLIE	You've planning this since Africa, haven't you? Yeah. Motherfuckers! Both of you.

SAMMY	Charlie, come on.

CHARLIE	Shut the fuck up. Okay, Sammy?

SAMMY	You're acting soft again.

AVA	We're gonna figure this out.

CHARLIE	I should have seen this coming. That deal? Too good to be true.

AVA	It's not your fault. You only see the best in people. I'm going to go to the store. You need anything?

CHARLIE	No, I'm okay. Thanks.

AVA	Okay. I can't believe you, Mikey! Who do you think you are?

MIKEY	Are you serious? I can't believe that you actually think...

AVA	You fucking lied to us!

MIKEY	You don't understand. I had nothing to do with this. Sammy is setting me up.

AVA	That's bullshit. You knew about the fucking drugs.

MIKEY	I, yeah, I did. I knew about the drugs but I'm not involved. Look, I caught Sammy and Koflex making plans.

AVA	Okay.

MIKEY	I caught them making plans.

AVA	Okay. So then why didn't you say anything?

MIKEY	Because...

AVA	Why didn't you tell Charlie?

MIKEY	'Cause Sammy knows about us.

AVA	What?

MIKEY	After I caught him, he broke in here and found these.

AVA	Fuck! What are we going to do?

MIKEY	I don't know. Alright. Okay. I'll... I'll think of something.

AVA	Yeah, you better.

MIKEY 	But there wasn't much to think about.
MIKEY 	Sammy had us all cornered. I was walking a tight rope, drug smuggling, African warlords, federal fucking agents! What the fuck was I thinking? I wish I had gone to prison. What is all this?

CHARLIE	This is the mess, you and Pablo fucking Junior over there got me into.

SONG	No mercy for you No worries for you That Games Of Thrones Go Cersei on you I flip the script I roll the dice Don't fall asleep 'Cause I'm working nights Hey you tryin' to shut me out It's getting blatant Hey I'll come and see you Now no hesitation Yeah I'm really really tired Of being patient Hey if you won't give it to me Imma take it Take it If you won't give it to me Imma take it §

SAMMY	Hey, partner. So, what do you think?

MIKEY	Where you gonna put all this, Sammy?

SAMMY	Where? Everywhere. Put in the seats, the floor, the panels, the roof, fuck it! We'll even put 'em in goddammed engine block.

CHARLIE	Jesus Christ!

SAMMY	Be honest with me. She's a freak in the bedroom, isn't she?

SONG	Yeah I come and see you now No hesitation Yeah I'm really really Tired of being patient §

SAMMY	Good for you.

SONG	Yeah if you won't Give it to me imma take it

SAMMY	I wish I was a fucking polygamist so I can marry each and every one of you ladies.

SONG	Take it  If you won't give it to me Imma take it

DET. REID	Welcome, Michael. This is Michael Braley; our man inside, everyone. Have a seat. Hit the lights, please. This is Koflex Odemene. A Nigerian-born refugee, and former member of the LRA, Lord's Resistance Army of Uganda. He's a reputed drug smuggler and international arms dealer. Koflex is working with this man... Sammy Olinski; one of the partners of a global car theft ring, involved in hundreds of stolen exotic and high-end luxury vehicles being shipped to several countries in West Africa. This is Charlie Rivera. Any luxury car stolen in the GTA can be traced back to this man. We have intel that these men are set to make the largest shipment of narcotics that this department has ever seen. We believe the group will use several high-end vehicles to conceal the shipment. The cars will be loaded in the shipping containers, and will await transport at this location. Now I will hand it over to Squad Leader, Sgt. Davidson, who will walk us through the sting operation. Sgt. Davidson.

SGT. DAVIDSON	Thank you, Detective. A week from now, we'll be executing a search warrant for Det. Reid at Koflex's shipping yard. It'll be a night raid set for over at 0100 hours. We'll be entering onto the property in three teams; one from the north, one from the west, and one from the east. Uniformed officers will stage here while K9 and Air 2 will be on standby in case we have a runner. Det. Reid will provide us the green light as soon as the shipment and the targets are verified on the scene. If you have any questions, please refer to your handouts. Officer Diaz.

OFFICER DIAZ 	Yeah. What's with the south wing?

SGT. DAVIDSON	South wing's a dead zone. Containers here are about 40ft high, there's no chance of escape. We've verified there's no contraband and those containers are not moving anytime soon. Trust me, these guys are smart. They're not going to get caught in this area. Got it? Alright. Let's talk tactics.

AVA	You're scared now, Mikey?

MIKEY	I can explain.

AVA	Turn us all in, save your own ass. Was that the idea?

MIKEY	You're gonna have to trust me, okay, Ava.

AVA	It's a little late for that.

MIKEY	What are you doing?

AVA	What do you think I'm doing? I'm calling Charlie.

MIKEY	Oh no! Wait a second. Wait a second.

AVA	Charlie might have given you a second chance, but I won't.

MIKEY	I'm a cop!

CHARLIE	Hello?

AVA 	Charlie...

CHARLIE 	Yeah.

AVA 	I need to tell you something.

CHARLIE 	What's that?

AVA 	We're out of milk.

CHARLIE 	Okay.

AVA 	Can you get some on your way home?

CHARLIE	Sure, I guess.

MIKEY	They forced me to do it.

AVA	You bastard.

MIKEY	I didn't have a choice.

AVA	There's always a choice, Mikey.

MIKEY	I'm not gonna let anything happen to you or Charlie, okay?

AVA	I don't believe you.

MIKEY	Well, you're gonna have to. Alright? If any of this gets out, then we're all fucked. Just give me some time, please. Just a little bit of time. I'll figure this out.

AVA	You better fucking know what you're doing.

MIKEY	Fuck!

AVA	What is this?

MIKEY	That... is our way out. It's a dead end. The police aren't covering it.

AVA	Wait, if it's a dead end, then where's the fucking way out?

MIKEY	That's where you come in. You're gonna go to the container yard and you're gonna talk to Gordie.

AVA	Who?

MIKEY	Gordie. He's one of the loaders that Charlie deals with.

AVA	Gordie!

MIKEY 	You'll recognize him right away. He's kind of slow, he has these huge bifocals, and he's always asking...

GORDIE	What's that?

AVA	I need you to remove all the contents from container 30994.

GORDIE	Thank you very much!

MIKEY	After that, you're gonna get him to empty the entire container. When he's done, you go in and you get to work. You're gonna cut every single lock on both sides.

AVA	And that's it?

MIKEY	No. Before you do any of that, you have to go to this address. It's a costume shop. You're gonna ask for Lazlo. He's gonna give you a uniform for Gordie.

AVA	Why me? Why aren't you doing this?

MIKEY	'Cause I'm working a 12-hour day. I can't get away from Sammy and Charlie. And even if I could, the cops are watching me. If I'm spotted even once in that container yard, then it's game over.

AVA	I'm only doing this for Charlie. If he gets hurt...

DET. REID	Isaiah...

ISAIAH	Detective.

DET. REID	See if you can get me some background on that suspect.

ISAIAH	Don't worry, we'll find him.

DET. REID	Thanks.

OFFICER KOVITZ	Hey.

DET. REID	Hey.

OFFICER KOVITZ	One of Koflex's guys was just arrested on a DUI.

DET. REID	That's good for us, right?

OFFICER KOVITZ	No, we got a problem. They found these in his car.

DET. REID	Damn!

OFFICER KOVITZ	I know.

SAMMY	Alright, take it. That's it, boys. That's the last of it.

CHARLIE	What now?

SAMMY	Now? Now, we get paid. Let me call Koflex, tell him we're on our way. Koflex, Sammy here. We're all done. When do you want to meet us at the container yards?

KOFLEX 	Still lots of time, Sammy. Let's meet at the club first.

SAMMY 	The club?

KOFLEX 	Yeah. Oh, and Sammy, bring the entire crew as well.

SAMMY 	Alright.

CHARLIE	So what'd he say?

SAMMY	He wants to meet us at the club.

CHARLIE	The club?

SAMMY	It's fine. It's fine.

CHARLIE	Okay. How come you're not dancing?

AVA	I don't feel like it, Charlie. What the fuck are we even doing here?

CHARLIE	That's a good question. What are we doing here, Sammy?

SAMMY	There's nothing to worry about. He's a businessman. Sure, he's got a reason.

MIKEY	I'm gonna go to the washroom. I'll be back.

DET. REID	Come on. Come on. Damn it! Where are you?

MIKEY 	What!

DET. REID 	Mikey, where the hell have you been? I've been trying to reach you.

MIKEY 	We're at the club. Koflex wants to meet us here. What the hell is going on?

DET. REID 	Mikey, get the fuck outta there.

MIKEY 	I can't, everyone's here. What about the shipment?

DET. REID 	Forget about the shipment. Koflex knows.

MIKEY 	What?

DET. REID 	Koflex knows that you're an agent! Get out of there. Now!

MAN	You shouldn't drink so much, bro. Gotta pace yourself. That, that's fucking gross, man.

MIKEY 	Hey, hey, hey, buddy. Hey, uh, look. Look, there's been a change of plans.

GORDIE	What plan?

MIKEY	What, what plan? The plan that we talked about.

GORDIE 	Huh?

MIKEY 	Okay, listen to me. I need you to write down this address, okay? 87 D'Arcy Street.

GORDIE 	Okay.

KOFLEX	Back home, when I was in the war... I had a Commander. He loved Shakespeare. Julius Caesar was his favorite. "So let the gods so speed me as I love the name of honor more than I fear death."

SAMMY	Cheers!

KOFLEX	Samuel, do you remember when we met in Ghana? What I told you when you asked to work with me? Ah, Mikey, Mikey! Perfect timing. Sit down, you don't want to miss this story. I was just telling your friends the first time I met Sammy. So, do you remember what I told you?

SAMMY	No. You're kind of freaking me out, man. 

KOFLEX	Ah, there's no reason to be freaked out now. Come on. I was just fucking with you. We are here to celebrate, are we not? To Sammy! May you rot in hell.

CHARLIE	What the fuck!

KOFLEX	I know you're working with the police.

CHARLIE	What the fuck are you talking about?

KOFLEX	We caught Mikey and your whore of a girlfriend outside the police station.

MIKEY	No, no. No, no, no. No, Charlie had nothing to do with it, alright? It was just me.

AVA	Charlie, it's not what you think. He was trying to save you.

OFFICER 1	Run! Drop it!

SGT. DAVIDSON	Michael Braley. Identify yourself.

MIKEY	I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

OFFICER	Folks, this way please. Keep it moving.

CHARLIE 	Fuuuccckk!

DET. REID	You think this is a fucking joke?

MIKEY	What?

DET. REID	Where the hell is he, Mikey?

MIKEY	Who?

DET. REID	Your pal, Charlie. We know that you were trying to help him escape.

MIKEY	Wow! He escaped?

DET. REID	Yeah, he escaped.

MIKEY	Where'd he go?

DET. REID	You fucking...

OFFICER KOVITZ	Jesus Christ!

CHARLIE	I was reaching for the stars. What the fuck happened?

AVA	I really thought he was gonna save us.

CHARLIE	Us?

OFFICER KOVITZ	Come on, Mikey. We know you snuck back into the yard. We know you had plans to help Charlie. Just tell us where they went.

DET. REID	We also know about your lover, Ava, cutting locks in the container! So stop fucking around and tell us where they went.

MIKEY	What the fuck do you want from me? Huh? I almost died today. And how the hell did Koflex know that I was an agent, huh? And even if I had died, who would've been responsible? You? You? Who cares about the punk car thief, as long as we get what we want, huh?

DET. REID	Shit!

CHARLIE	Finally. We're freezing back here. Officer, you think we could get some heat? Yo! Turn on the heat!

GORDIE	What's that?

CHARLIE	Gordie?

GORDIE	Buckle up, Charlie!

CHARLIE	Fuck!

DET. REID	Mikey.

MIKEY	What?

DET. REID	Don't leave town.

MIKEY	I won't.

SONG	It's been a long while Since the words came quick My heart was narrow  And my skin was thick  Blessed and I'm cursed By the feeling I can't forget All the sparks I've seen Oooooohh §

CHARLIE	You know we're gonna have to start all over, right?

AVA	Where are we going?

CHARLIE	Why don't you ask the captain?

SONG	Built up to ruin By this simple fear Losing everything That I hold dear Oooooohh §

AVA	So where are we going, Mikey?

MIKEY	It's a surprise.

AVA	Somewhere warm, I hope.

MIKEY	 You ever seen Bad Boys?

AVA	 One or Two?

SONG	Maybe I was young Or just naive Now I'm not sure What to believe Nothing comes as easy As I thought this was Nothing turns out Like the dream of it does Oooooohh I thought I had it all figured out But I can't distinguish Truth from the doubt Doesn't come as easy As I thought this was Nothing turns out Like the dream of it does Oooooohh Oooooohh Oooooohh Oooooohh You didn't think That I could make it I was underestimated Mind over matter No matter over mind I break your barricades And borderlines Never cautious So don't wanna sound I'm not to overpower anything You're trying to undermine I live a legend on the track Institution on the field Natural born warrior The coliseum know the deal But when I started Walls they were closin' in Underestimated Now I'm overthrowin' I'm ridin’ like the chariots Of fire against a opponent Don't know who's chosen For the podium... Ooohhh Ooohhh You didn't think That I could make it I was underestimated This is dedicated to everybody Who doubted me You made a gladiator Out of me You're all the reason Why I stay motivated While my team flags Stays elevated This is dedicated To everybody who doubted me You made a gladiator Out of me Game time every win Celebrated from the top Let 'em know how we made it Use to hate to confuse you But I won't let it MJ how I follow through If I ever said it Growing up I was hard headed To self-select I always knew I deserve more I just had to get it Got it Good I'm great Call me Era the Great Everything for the win A looser couldn't relate All the time in the gym I may handle the weight I waited a long time for My time give me your plate Born to create Give me light give me buzz Give me money give me peace Give me all of the above To see the light You need a plug So give me health Give me wisdom And all of the love  I'm a beast ground hard The paper and break I attack But we've on a golden break? Up north while wars are crazy And Jays must I remind you In the presence of Canadian Kings played solo? But when I started Walls they were closin' in Underestimated Now I'm overthrowin' I'm ridin’ like the chariots Of fire against a opponent Don't know who's chosen For the podium...
