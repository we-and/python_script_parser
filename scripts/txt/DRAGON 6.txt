(THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL 6)


WITCH	Your Highness, what brings you to my domain?

PETER THE FIRST	Dear Princess, I have a very important mission to pursue…

WITCH	Perhaps we should talk privately then. Come with me!

PETER THE FIRST	That was fast…There are legends about me in Russia.

MISS DUDLEY	Don't let her break your heart, Your Majesty!

PETER THE FIRST	Stay there. I'll be right back.

WITCH SERVANT	Come with me...

PETER THE FIRST	Beautiful chambers.

JONATHAN GREEN	What in God’s name is happening...

WITCH SERVANT	And now let’s have another fairly judged execution! Let the Dragon decide the fate of the foreign traveler!

MISS DUDLEY	This is my husband!

WITCH SERVANT	Is he your husband?

MISS DUDLEY	Please, have mercy!
 
WITCH SERVANT	If he is your husband than it's a completely different story! Now I see, things differently. Well, then arrest her too! Take their weapons away! 

MISS DUDLEY	Let me go!  They are lying to you! She is not the real pri…!

WITCH SERVANT	Tie her up with the other foreigner! The white-skinned woman is a witch!

PETER THE FIRST	Mmm! Delicious! 

JONATHAN GREEN	Who’s there?

CONDUCTOR	Go right! Now, open the mouth at him! Pull back to the rock.

SIRKO	That’s, that's not a real dragon! 

SPIRID	Let’s take it all down, shall we?

JONATHAN GREEN	Who... Who is there?  Who is it? I can hear you but I don't understand you. Speak clearly...

CONDUCTOR	Open the mouth wilder! Hehehehe! Wait! What do you want? We were waiting for Chen Lang.  Now we have to fry you up as an appetizer!

WITCH	This one is done! Search him and bring the Seal to me. I'll prepare to meet with the Dragon now.

CONDUCTOR	Pump the bellows!  Get the blower ready! That's it!  Hide it up! And prepare the lightning charge!

SIRKO	Where did you come from?

CAPTAIN	Shh! Everybody swam, so I swam too…

SIRKO	Easy, easy! 

CAPTAIN	Don’t worry!

SPIRID	Cut this one too!

CONDUCTOR	And here comes the surprise!

CAPTAIN	Hello beautiful! Still regret me? Now you’re free!

JONATHAN GREEN	Emma?

SPIRID	Run!

JONATHAN GREEN	Oh, sorry! It is you! It’s really you!

MISS DUDLEY	My father was right! Why didn't I listen?.. 

JONATHAN GREEN	What did you do that for? 

MISS DUDLEY	Now do you understand? 

JONATHAN GREEN	You are upset... I can... I can see that.

MISS DUDLEY	Of course I'm upset! You traveled in the same carriage with this… that…Girl!

JONATHAN GREEN	What girl are you talking about?

MISS DUDLEY	The most beautiful girl in China!

JONATHAN GREEN	I love…you!

MISS DUDLEY	Get away!

JONATHAN GREEN	Not now!

MISS DUDLEY	Come on!

JONATHAN GREEN	Run faster!


SOLDIER	Shields! Spears! Archers ready! Shoot! Get ready! Shoot!

JONATHAN GREEN	Come here! Give me your hand! Come, come on!

REBEL	Pepper!

SOLDIERS	Spears! Pepper! Pepper! I can't see a thing! It's pepper! My eyes!

COSSACS	All together!

CAPTAIN	Hurrah! There are a lot of them, and they're very tall. 

WITCH	Dragon. I command you to obey! I am here to save you now… And now…

MAIDSERVANT	Your Majesty... 

WITCH	What? Where is the seal?

MAIDSERVANT	Your Majesty, this is everything we found.

WITCH	I've got to do everything myself!

KHOMA	You need a rest.

REBEL	Get the sheet ready!

WIZARD’S ASSISTANT	Bring them! Hurry up!

SOLDIER	There's nothing left. They destroyed the laboratory!
