(MR DUNDEE)



BARNEY	You got to do something.
 
PAUL	Why have I got to do something?

BARNEY	Cause I don't really like snakes.

PAUL	I don't like them either. Why don't we just turn around and go back the way we came up?
 
BARNEY	Cause everyone's watching.

SCHOOL KID	Please, Mr Dundee.

BARNEY	Yeah, come on Mr Dundee.
 
MAN	Go Dundee.

PAUL	I'm not really Crocodile Dundee, you know. It's just a character I play in a movie.

BARNEY	He's being modest. That movie was practically a documentary.

PAUL	Shut up, Barney.
	
TEACHER	Stand back everyone … boys.

PAUL	Oh shit.
	
SCHOOL KID	Be careful.

BARNEY	Uses a stick. He'll have that thing on the barbeque tonight.
	
PAUL	It's dead (laughs).
	
TEACHER	Um, yeah, not that one.
	
PAUL	Huh?

TEACHER	Could you get the other one?
	
PAUL	The other one? I was …Geez. Shit.
	
BARNEY	Everything okay?
	
TEACHER	Ahhhhh!
	
CROWD	(screams)
	
TV HOST 1	As hilarious reports continue to surface of Paul …

TV HOST 2	… "Crocodile Dundee" Hogan's ill-fated rendezvous with a snake …

TV HOST 3	... we asked where the man from Down Under has been hiding.
	
TV HOST 4	The one time rigger on The Sydney Harbour Bridge first got his big break on Australian talent show, New Faces.
	
TV HOST 5	He instantly became a household favourite, and quickly this every man went on to star in his own sketch comedy series, The Paul Hogan Show.
	
TV HOST 6	Dominating the Australian ratings over a 14-year period, made Hoges a household name... and introduced such iconic characters as Arthur Dunger, Luigi The Unbelievable, and stunt man extraordinaire, Leo Wanker.
 
TV HOST 3	The world beckoned, and as Hoges fronted Australia's most successful tourism campaign, we booked our flights and flocked down under in droves.

TV HOST 7	It was then, Hogan unleashed ...
 
A.P BEN MENDELSOHN	... the most successful independent film in the history of cinema ...

TV HOST 8	Crocodile Dundee.

TV HOST 9	Crocodile Dundee, of course.

TV HOST 3	Crocodile Dundee.

PAUL	That's not a knife. That's a knife.
 

 
TV HOST 3	The low-budget Aussie comedy went on to gross over $300 million worldwide, and saw Paul Hogan co-host the 1987 Academy Awards... and make him one of the most recognisable faces on the planet and a national treasure.
	
A.P HUGH JACKMAN	Growing up in Australia there was one name that was beyond an idol, in a way. And I'm just going to say one word. Hoges. Hoges was your every man, Hoges was the Aussie you wanted to be.

TV HOST 3	In 1989 came Dundee Two, and saw Hogan move to live in the US.
	
ET HOST	More films were to follow but all failed to capture the same success as Crocodile Dundee.
	
	
	
	
	
	
TV HOST 2	And almost overnight, Hogan disappeared from American screens. And apart from a brief cameo in a new Australian tourism campaign ...


TV HOST 5	... he has rarely been seen again.

TV HOST 3	If you want to know what the notoriously private star has been up to these past 20 years, your guess is as good as mine.
	
	
ANGIE	What the hell was that?

PAUL	What?

ANGIE	You threw a snake at a fifth- grade teacher and hit her in the face.

PAUL	Oh, oh, she thought I was the real Crocodile Dundee.

ANGIE	So you threw a snake at her?

PAUL	Oh, no, that was an accident. Bloody thing leaped at me.

ANGIE	Right. And yet she thought you were the real Crocodile Dundee.

PAUL	Yeah. He probably would've eaten it.

ANGIE	Paul, I hardly have any clients left as it is. Could you just please try not to kill yourself?
		
PAUL	Okay.

ANGIE	Thank you.

PAUL	Uh, where are we going?

ANGIE	Oh, I have news.

PAUL	Oh.

ANGIE	Yeah. See this letter?

PAUL	What?

ANGIE	Well, God knows why, but apparently the Queen of England wants to bestow you with a Knighthood.
 
PAUL	What for?

ANGIE	For services to comedy.

PAUL	Services to co ... I don't want a knighthood.

ANGIE	Well, you're getting one.

PAUL	So, so this is serious?

ANGIE	Ugh, look at that. There's that Dundee impersonator.

PAUL	Oh, he's still here? Ha.

ANGIE	I hate it. You know, people keep telling me he's strung out.

BAD DUNDEE	Good ol' Mick Dundee. Hey, crocodile man.

PAUL	They're all strung out.

ANGIE	Yeah. But he doesn't even look like Dundee. And apparently he's rude to the kids and then charges them something like $5 just to take his picture.

PAUL	Ah, it's Hollywood Boulevard. They're all crooks.

ANGIE	Yeah, I know. Oh, and yes, this is very serious.

PAUL	Oh, oh yay. They want me to appear in person six weeks from now in London.

ANGIE	I know. How great is that?

PAUL	I'm not going.

ANGIE	But, what? You are.
	
PAUL	W- w- why would I go to ...? I mean, I've been trying to retire for the last 20 years.

ANGIE	I know.

PAUL	You know me, I'm lazy. I like to stay at home and watch Ellen on TV and do crossword puzzles.

ANGIE	But despite all that, it seems the Queen is actually quite the fan.
	
PAUL	Oh.

ANGIE	I know. I'm not surprised. I mean, come on. You, you put Australia on the map. You had the most successful independent film in history, Paul. I mean, you've got to think about your legacy.

PAUL	My legacy?

ANGIE	Having a legacy is a beautiful thing. As your manager, I am telling you, you've got to do this. Oh, and, um, in the meantime, can you just try and behave yourself, because you know the palace hates any kind of controversy or trouble?


PAUL	Oh no, I never cause any controversy or trouble, no. Sometimes it just comes after me. What are we doing here?

ANGIE	Okay. Don't be mad, but the studio really, really wanted a meeting.

PAUL	Angie, I've been telling you for 20 years, I don't want to do another Dundee.

ANGIE	I know but they've got some really amazing casting news. Seriously, I have never heard the studio this excited and bursting with ideas. So I told them we'd take a meeting. Oh, come on, just do it for me, please? Can we meet with them? And then you can go home, take a nap and watch Ellen.

PAUL	All right, come on.

ANGIE	Okay. You know what? I can't go. I've got to meet mom, but you go ahead. You'll be great. Trust me. I'll call you later. Love you.

TOUR GUIDE	Oh look, everyone, there's Paul Hogan.

COURTNEY	Oh. Hi, Paul.

ROLAND	Hey.
	
COURTNEY	I'm Courtney. Pleasure.
	
ROLAND	Paul, it's an honour.
	
JOSH	Thanks for coming in, Paul. We heard you were very excited to meet.
	
PAUL	Uh, yeah.

ROLAND	Let me just start by saying that we are huge fans of the Crocodile Dundee movies.

JOSH	And we want to bring it back.

ROLAND	We know you've been a little resistant in the past, but please just hear us out.
	
PAUL	Sure.

JOSH	We'd really love to see Dundee come to Los Angeles.

PAUL	Dundee in LA?

ROLAND	Exactly.

PAUL	Like we did in Dundee Three?

JOSH	There was a Dundee Three?

ROLAND	Are you sure?

PAUL	Reasonably.

ANTON	Here we go.

JOSH	Uh-huh.

COURTNEY	Drinks.
	
ANTON	One sunrise kiss with added kale.

COURTNEY	Thank you.

ANTON	Blended oats and chai supreme. Ah Josh …

JOSH	Yes siree.

ANTON	Lemon and rocket essence.

JOSH	Perfecto.
	
ANTON	Now Paul …

PAUL	Mm-hmm, uh, um …

ANTON	I made you my favourite, which is a cleansing blend of mint, goat's milk, activated walnuts, and baby spinach with agavé syrup.
	
JOSH	Woo-hoo, agavé syrup.

PAUL	Yeah, thanks.

ROLAND	Go on.

COURTNEY	Take a sip

JOSH	Yeah, yeah, drink.

COURTNEY	Come on.
 
JOSH	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm ?

ANTON	It's good, huh?


PAUL	Yeah.

JOSH	And ah ... okay, let's forget the location.


COURTNEY	We want to introduce your son, a Dundee Junior. You know, someone who shares all of your qualities and attributes but who can bring the franchise forward for a younger new generation.

PAUL	Yeah well, we've already been down that road and that, um, didn't sort of work.

JOSH	Yes, but this time we have just the actor. He's A-list, he is charming, funny as hell.

COURTNEY	A little bit cute.

JOSH	He is perfect, and a massive, massive fan.

ROLAND	So without any further ado, to play your son ... Will Smith.

PAUL	Will …

JOSH	Smith.

COURTNEY	Look at him! Oh, he can't believe it.

JOSH	Believe it, Paul. He wants to play your son.
	
PAUL	Yeah, yeah, but …

JOSH	Okay. We know what you're thinking.

ROLAND	Yeah.
	
JOSH	He's too old.

PAUL	No, that's not what I'm thinking.

COURTNEY	But, he's just turned 50 and he looks great.
	
PAUL	Yeah, I'm sure of it.

ROLAND	What? He's American?

JOSH	He's fantastic with accents.

ROLAND	Yeah.

COURTNEY	We'll get him a voice coach.


PAUL	Yeah, but that's not the problem. It's just that he's…
	
JOSH	Hey Barry, huh, well we got Paul Hogan here.
	
BARRY	What's up?

JOSH	We're just discussing the Dundee casting.

BARRY	My man, Crocodile Dundee.

PAUL	Hey, Barry.

JOSH	Sorry, Paul, you were saying?

PAUL	Well it just doesn't make sense. It's just that he's …

BARRY	Hey Kyle?

KYLE	Yes.

BARRY	Bring that thing in here.

KYLE	Sure.

BARRY	So, we can show our excitement.

COURTNEY	Oh, great, perfect. Perfect timing.

BARRY	Hey, it's a crocodile. Sorry, sorry Paul, you were saying?
	
PAUL	Oh yeah, well …

ROLAND	You don't seem too sure about Will. What is it? You can tell us.

COURTNEY	Mm-hmm.

BARRY	Be honest. Is he, is it height?

PAUL	No.

BARRY	His build?

PAUL	No.

BARRY	His hair colour?

PAUL	Closer.

COURTNEY	His acting?
	
PAUL	No, I love Will Smith. I think he's fabulous. He's great. But um …

BARRY	What? What is it, Paul?

PAUL	He's black!
	
ANGIE	You did what?

PAUL	I didn't do anything.

ANGIE	Paul, not more than 20 minutes ago I told you to behave yourself and now you suddenly decide to become a racist?
	
PAUL	Racist? Oh, rubbish.

ANGIE	They said you said you didn't like Will Smith because he was black.

PAUL	No. I just said it makes no sense that me and the equally-white Sue Charlton have an African-American son.
	
ANGIE	Oh, God. Paul, you can't say that.

PAUL	Oh, I'm fairly sure I already did.

ANGIE	Now I know why my dad always wanted to quit managing you.

PAUL	He never wanted to quit.

ANGIE	Paul, um, what do you say we just keep this Will Smith stuff to ourselves, huh? And you just try and behave.
	
PAUL	I'll try.
	
ANGIE	Okay, bye. Oh, God!


PAUL	Paddy, oh. Want your dinner, don't you? Here it comes!

CHASE	Hey Dad.


PAUL	Oh, hey mate. How's your day been?

CHASE	It's good, it's good. Not too bad. How about you?

PAUL	Hmm. Not bad. Listen, do you want any dinner?

CHASE	Oh, I already had a bite earlier, actually.

PAUL	Oh.
	
GIRL 1	Hi.

CHASE	Hi.
		
GIRL 2	Hi.

CHASE	These are ... they're my friends.

PAUL	Yeah. Um, there's some ice cream left down there. Do you want me to leave you a bit?

CHASE	You know, I'm, I'm good actually, Dad. But I might grab some in a bit, eh?

PAUL	Okay.
	
CHASE	Why don't you come in and visit?

PAUL	Well, I'd love to, but, um, no, it's a bit late for me.

CHASE	Sure.
	
PAUL	Yeah.
	
CHASE	Well.

PAUL	I'm leaving.

CHASE	I love you, Dad. Good to see you.

PAUL	Love ya.

CHASE	See ya.

TV PRESENTER	As excitement builds for Alf the Musical, which opens on Broadway next week.
 
ET PRESENTER 1	Meanwhile, at the domestic box office, Father-in-Law spends its second week at number one, making Pauly Shore's return to the top now complete.

ET PRESENTER 2	Welcome back, Pauly.

ET PRESENTER 1	Yeah, indeed.

ET PRESENTER 2	All right. Finally, the excitement of Paul Hogan returning to the public eye was short-lived, with some now asking whether the Australian actor threw the snake as a publicity stunt in a vain attempt to re- invigorate his acting career.

ET PRESENTER 1	His acting career? Ha! I think you're being too kind.
 

LUCY	(on telephone) Hi, Grandpa!
 
PAUL	Oh, Lucy. How are you, love? What time is it over there?

LUCY	(on telephone) I'm not sure, but early. I've got rehearsals before school today.

PAUL	Oh, what's that for?

LUCY	(on telephone) I'm doing the school play, the Wizard of Oz. Well, today's my first day. You should come and watch!

PAUL	Oh, I'd love to, kid, but, um, it's too far away.

LUCY	(on telephone) Mum said you've been getting in trouble.

PAUL	Who, me?

LUCY	(on telephone) You!
 
PAUL	Nah. She's probably getting confused with someone else.
 
LUCY	(on telephone) Oh. I wish you'd come back home, Grandpa.

PAUL	Believe me, kiddo, I'd be back there in a heartbeat. If I thought my poor old dog Paddy could handle a flight, especially now that Chase is doing so well over here.

LUCY	(on telephone) Yeah, I heard about Uncle Chase.
 
 
PAUL	Yeah. Never ceases to amaze me, that kid. I think he's running a nightclub out of his bedroom. So, how's the new school going?
 
LUCY	(on telephone) It's okay.
 
PAUL	Made any new friends?
 
LUCY	(on telephone) Grandpa?

PAUL	Yeah?

LUCY	(on telephone) I love you.
 
PAUL	Oh, I love you too, sweetie.
	
LUCY	(on telephone) Better get going. Bye!

VALET MAN	Valet?

REGGIE	Kimmel had a good one on you. Oh yeah, Colbert. He did a good five minutes on you.

PAUL	Great.

REGGIE	For somebody that just wants a quiet life and to be left alone, you're not doing a very good job of it.

PAUL	No, I'm not, am I?

REGGIE	Hey, talk is you're now taking to hate crimes? What's next, the Klan?
	
PAUL	The studio wanted Will Smith to play Dundee Junior.

REGGIE	Will Smith?

PAUL	Yeah!

REGGIE	That's ridiculous.

PAUL	I know!

REGGIE	I'll play Dundee! What, you thought I retired? I did Die Hard, for Christ sakes!

PAUL	I know.

REGGIE	People love me!

PAUL	I know.

YELLING MAN	Yo! Where's Urkel?

REGGIE	I did that, too.

PAUL	Yeah, I know. Come on.
	
MUSICIAN	Yippee-kye-yay!
	
OLIVIA	Paul! Hi!

PAUL	Oh, Livvie. Hi!

OLIVIA'S FRIEND	Alright. See ya.

PAUL	Hey.

OLIVIA	Good to see you.

PAUL	You look lovely.

OLIVIA	Yeah.

PAUL	Oh, you know Reggie?

OLIVIA	Of course I do.

REGGIE	Hi darling, how are you? Nice to see you.

OLIVIA	I was just thinking about you the other day.

PAUL	Oh, really?

OLIVIA	Yeah, I was thinking we hadn't seen each other for a long time, it's time we caught up.
	
PAUL	Yeah, that'd be great.

OLIVIA	I've got a girlfriend coming to visit from home, Ella, in a couple of weeks. I thought that'd be a great time.
	
PAUL	Yeah.

REGGIE	You know, I was just saying that he needs a woman.

OLIVIA	Perfect! So, um, what are you two guys doing next Tuesday night?
	
PAUL	Tuesday? Um …

OLIVIA	Yeah. I'm doing this charity thingy at my neighbour's school and it's going to be a lot of fun. You should come.
	
PAUL	Oh, yeah.

OLIVIA	John said he might come along, sing a couple of songs with me from Grease. And there's going to be, like, face painting and art stores and a barbie. You'll fit right in!

PAUL	Oh. Yeah. Oh, Tuesday, yeah, well see, Tuesday, I've got, um... Pity, uh, pity it wasn't Wednesday. You know, if it had been Wednesday, I'd have been there with bells on.

OLIVIA	Hold on. I think it is Wednesday.

PAUL	Oh.


OLIVIA	It is Wednesday. That's great! You can come.

PAUL	Ha, perfect.

OLIVIA	But look, here's a flyer. It's all about helping kids who can't help themselves.

REGGIE	Ah. I think it'll be great you can go. After all the bad press, being seen at some charity event is exactly what you need.

PAUL	Thanks.

OLIVIA	And, uh, maybe afterwards we can take a selfie and remind the world how much we love you.

PAUL	Oh, yeah.

OLIVIA	Yeah.

SUPERMARKET GUY	Everything all right, sir?

PAUL	Oh, yeah, just looking for the valet.

SUPERMARKET GUY	We don't have a valet. This is a supermarket.

PAUL	Oh.

BAD DUNDEE	Hey, no, no filming unless you got money. Come on. What you got here, $5 or any coins or anything? Oh yeah, I grew this after the movie. I'm the real guy. Want a photo? Better than Batman, eh?

PAUL	Why don't you try picking on someone your own size?

BAD	DUNDEE Go away, Grandad. Oh, come on.

PAUL	Well, at least stop being rude to the kids, okay?
 
BAD DUNDEE	Oh, wow. I thought you were dead.
 
PAUL	Well I'm not, shit-for-brains.

BAD DUNDEE	Oh, okay.
 
LADY	Look out! He's got a knife.

BAD DUNDEE	Oh, yes, you have a knife, but mine's bigger. So, you, uh, you want a photo? Come on.	

PAUL	That's not the line.

BAD DUNDEE	Yeah, it is.
 

PAUL	No, it's not!

BAD DUNDEE	Yes it is.

PAUL	That's not the line.

BAD DUNDEE	I been doing this for 20 years, I think I'd know.

PAUL	What?

BAD DUNDEE	Go away, you're bad for my business.

PAUL	I am your business.

BAD DUNDEE	Yeah, right.

FEMALE TOURIST	Uh, I, I would love to take the photo, please.

PAUL	Oh.

FEMALE TOURIST	Yeah. Yeah?

PAUL	Oh.

FEMALE TOURIST	Oh, okay, okay.
 
BAD DUNDEE	Yeah, okay, come here. Okay. Come on, hey.

PAUL	Oh.

FEMALE TOURIST	Thank you.

BAD DUNDEE	I'll show them my knife later, eh?

PAUL	You are such a sack of shit.

BAD DUNDEE	Come on boys, eh?

BOYS	Ah!

BAD DUNDEE	That's it, oh, hey! That's my boys.

NEWS ANCHOR	(on TV) Crocodile Dundee star, Paul Hogan, tried to strangle a child today when what was seemingly a child's innocent request for a photo enraged the obviously troubled star.

PAUL	(on TV) Oh, little mongrel, uh, I'll put your little head off.
 
NEWS ANCHOR	(on TV) Several onlookers, including Dorothy Springborg from Delaware, were almost caught up in the brawl.

DOROTHY F. DELAWARE	(on TV) It was disgusting. These were innocent children, for heck's sake.

PAUL	Um, uh, it wasn't as bad as I thought.

ANGIE	I don't even feel like I know you anymore. I ... I can't even look at you.

PAUL	I know. If you're worried about it, put me on one of them Tonight Shows.
 
ANGIE	Book you on one of those Tonight Shows? I mean, apart from being a punchline in their monologues lately, they're not gonna have you on their show. God!

PAUL	All right, well what about Ellen?

ANGIE	No! You've killed any chance of the knighthood. I mean, Paul what were you thinking?
 
PAUL	I don't care about a knighthood.

ANGIE	But I do, Paul. I do. I thought we were meeting the Queen, and ... and you agreed.
 
PAUL	No, I never agreed to any knighthood.


ANGIE	But I told them that you did.


PAUL	Well, tell them I didn't.

ANGIE	Seriously, you want me to cancel the knighthood?

PAUL	Absolutely.

ANGIE	You want me to call the palace?

PAUL	Yeah, call them right now.

ANGIE	And tell them no?

PAUL	Yup, mm-hmm. Hang on.

ANGIE	I don't know why I bother.

PAUL	I wish you wouldn't.

EMILIO	Oh hey, you out of bread?

PAUL	Wonder why? Oh hi, sweetie.
 
LUCY	(on telephone) Grandpa, are you getting a knighthood?
 
PAUL	Uh …

LUCY	(on telephone) Cause mum said you were, and I told some kids at my new school you were, and they laughed and said I'm a liar. I'm not a liar, am I, Grandpa?

PAUL	No, you're not a liar.

LUCY	(on telephone) You are getting a knighthood?
 
PAUL	Uh, yeah. Services to comedy.
 
LUCY	(on telephone) Yes, I knew it. Bye, Pa.
 
PAUL	Bye, Love.

EMILIO	Oh what a web we weave.

ANGIE	Huh, just called the palace. They're really not happy.

PAUL	Oh, yeah, see here's the thing.

ANGIE	No.

PAUL	You'll have to call them back.

ANGIE	No!

PAUL	Lucy thinks I'm getting it.

ANGIE	I'm gonna look like an idiot.

PAUL	Oh, she told the kids at school.

ANGIE	Oh, they'll get over it.

PAUL	No, they won't. It's a new school and she's trying to make friends.
	
ANGIE	Not happening.

PAUL	What about my, uh, legacy, you know? Uh, put Australia on the map, had a TV show...

EMILIO	And you're always good with the ladies.

PAUL	Good with the la- ladies?


ANGIE	Okay, fine. I will call them, but I am telling them you're an idiot.

PAUL	Great, great. Love ya.

EMILIO	Wow, it's 2 o'clock. It's time for your siesta. Come on, Paddy, help me cut the grass.

PAUL	Ah. Wayne?


WAYNE	I need somewhere to stay. Carol is driving me crazy. She keeps saying I'm too loud.

PAUL	Too loud?

WAYNE	Yeah, and, and ... and the kids are crying.

PAUL	Crying?

WAYNE	I just need some place quiet for a couple of days.

PAUL	Um, it's not really a good time.

WAYNE	Well, you won't even know I'm here. I start rehearsals on Broadway soon, and I need to practise. Oh, oh, oh, oh. If Carol asks, you haven't seen me.
	
PAUL	Huh?

WAYNE	Hello ma baby, hello ma (singing) honey, hello ma ragtime gal Send me a kiss by wire. Baby my heart's on fire If you refuse me, honey you'll lose me then you'll be left alone Oh baby telephone and tell me I'm your own Hello ma Baby Hello ma ragtime Send me a kiss Baby, my heart's on fire
	
ANGIE	Wait, so he sings?

PAUL	Uh, and he also tap dances.

ANGIE	Oh.

PAUL	Evidently. Cop it.
 
WAYNE	(singing and tapping) ... a kiss by wire. Baby my...

ANGIE	Paul, you have three showers. Why is he using your en-suite?
 
PAUL	Oh, he said the acoustics are better in my bathroom.
 
ANGIE	Oh, what time is the Olivia thing?

PAUL	Oh, that's now.


ANGIE	You know, I am so glad you're doing this. And I really think that people are starting to forget that you threw a snake at those bystanders. And that you tried to beat up those kids. And the Will Smith thing. But I honestly think it's almost all behind us, so it's the perfect time to be seen with the lovely Livvy doing something for the kids.
 
PAUL	Oh yeah, that'll be fun.

ANGIE	Oh, do you want me to organise a lift for you or something?
 
PAUL	Uh, no, I booked a car, thanks.

ANGIE	Okay. Oh, and Paul, I'm really sorry I've been so crazy about this whole knighthood thing. I am just so proud of you, and the fact that I get to be there …

PAUL	Oh, there's my car now. Gotta go. Yeah, give my love to your mum.
 
ANGIE	Rude.

JOHN CLEESE	Paul.

JOHN CLEESE	You know, I love it. You know, I don't get stuck behind a desk. I'm my own boss, I get to meet interesting people, and let's face it, these days romantic leads for 79 year old actors are few and far between.

PAUL	Mm-hmm.

JOHN CLEESE	Hollywood. You'd know all about that, eh?

PAUL	Yeah, guess so.

JOHN CLEESE	You steaming turd!
 
PAUL	Um, I don't mean to be nosey, John, but you know, you're happy driving and everything ... Uh, what happened? After all your success, I ...

PAUL	Uh, Olivia asked me to come.

REPORTER 1	But, why here?

PAUL	Well, to help, to help these unfortunate little people. And they need all the help they can get, you know? I mean, they've ... they've had a raw deal out of life, and it's up to us to try and help them.
 
REPORTER 1	Mm-hmm. Oh, really?


PAUL	Yeah, yeah, I don't pity them. They're ... they're having a little concert in here tonight, and some of them are gonna get up and try and sing.
 
REPORTER 1	Try and sing?

LUKE	Ah, aw. Oh. No, no, no, I'm Luke. I'm a wedding photographer. I'm from Indiana.

PAUL	And?

LUKE	Um, that's, uh ... that's all I got.

PAUL	What was so interesting up my tree?

LUKE	Okay, look, I ... I was a wedding photographer 'til I messed things up. I went to the wrong wedding. Oh, the other photographer got so mad at me, and then no-one would hire me. But then my mom, she got me a job at a magazine, so I'd go out ... they asked me to go get a photo of Eric Bana, 'cause he was visiting our town. But I got confused, I went and got a picture of Eric Banana, the Fruit King. Do you know him? He knows so much about fruit. After that, my boss, he just suggested that I should just move far away, you know, maybe to LA and become a freelance paparazzo.



PAUL	Oh great, that's what we need. Another idiot taking photos of me.

LUKE	Actually no, I'm trying to get a photo of Kim Kardashian but I can't find where her house is. She is so sneaky. Anyway, I took the star tour and we went past here.

PAUL	Oh, so I'm still on the star map, am I?

LUKE	No. No, you're not, but you know who is? Bob Saget from Full House.
	He's like your neighbour. We all got out, we're taking pictures of his place ... it  was so awesome. Yeah, and then I looked over and I saw you, you were like getting your trash cans or something, and I was like "Hey, that's Paul Hogan." And the driver was like "No, no that's not Paul Hogan. He's dead."

PAUL	He said that?

LUKE	Yeah. But you know what, I'm glad you're not dead, Paul.
	
PAUL	Look, I ... Listen, I don't want to do this on film.

LUKE	It's just, you're the only celebrity friend I have.
	Do you know, maybe, do you know where Kim Kardashian lives?

PAUL	Look, if you're looking for celebrities go down Melrose Avenue. That's where they all hang out.
 
LUKE	Okay. Okay, or you know what? I could stay here.

PAUL	No.

LUKE	Ah, no? That's fine, okay. Do you know what's the best way to get to this Melrose?
 
PAUL	Drive there.

LUKE	Drive there? Got it. I don't have a car.
 
PAUL	Bloody hell.

LUKE	You know what, that's fine. That's fine. I can hitch. It works, all right, so I will do that. I'll just get my ... my stuff. Ah, it's... whoa, don't worry about me, it's not as heavy as it looks. It's all good.

PAUL	Ah. That way.

LUKE	Of course it is. Wish I would have known that earlier. This is not a backpack. All right, well hey, it was great meeting you, Paul.
 
PAUL	Uh, okay.

LUKE	Did you say something? I though you said "Aw". I heard some "Aw".

PAUL	No. No.
 
LUKE	Really wish we could hang out longer. I gotta get going.
 
WAYNE	(whistling)
 
PAUL	(sighs)
 
WAYNE	(singing)… on your own …
 
NEWS REPORTER	(on TV) Though the police vow they will continue to search for the phantom valet, claiming he has now stolen upwards of 85 motor vehicles. In other news, it was all the talk of the BT Awards tonight when ex-movie star Paul Hogan got himself in a lot of trouble.

REPORTER	Mr. Hogan, why are you here?
 
PAUL	To help these unfortunate little people, and they need all the help they can get.

LUKE HEMSWORTH	(on TV) I'm an ambassador for Australia, okay, for tourism. Wait, to be honest, no, I ... I started telling people that I'm from New Zealand. Yeah, I, I even married one, you know? So …
 
LUKE BRACEY	(on TV) I don't know what Hogan's problem is. Ah, maybe he thinks it's funny, I don't know, but as with Lightning Jack, no one else is laughing.

COSTAS MANDYLOR	(on TV) I was with some friends the other night, Mike Tyson, Mickey Rourke, Charlie Sheen ... we all agreed that no one's fallen from grace as hard as Paul Hogan. It's embarrassing. Is it the drugs?

PAUL	Oh bummer. Ah well, you're happy here, aren't ya?
 
TV COMMERCIAL VOICE	Australia. There's no place like it.
 
CHRIS HEMSWORTH	(on TV) See ya next week, Barry.
 
DANNY MCBRIDE	(on TV) Not a lot of crocs out here, huh?

CHRIS HEMSWORTH	This is 37,000 miles of pristine, beautiful beach, (on TV) mate.

PAUL	Like I don't know that.

CHASE	All righty guys, good morning. You ready to feel the burn in your legs and in your soul? Let's go. Ready guys? Limber up and get ready for hell with some kicks ...One, two, three. Feel the burn, feel the pain, it's gonna hurt, I'm not gonna lie. Feel the energy. Bit of this, bit of that.
 
PAUL	He teaches aerobics now.

CHASE	Squat, squat, squat. Hi Dad.
 
PAUL	You want some breakfast?

CHASE	No, no, I'm all right, I got this. Why don't you put your gear on and come out?

PAUL	Ah, yeah.
 
CHASE	All right. Hold ... pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse. Breathe out the bad. What do you reckon, guys? Very nice. Very, very nice.
 
ANGIE	The woman is 81 years old and a nun. I just need to know, why?
 
PAUL	She was annoying me.
 
ANGIE	She was annoying you?

PAUL	No! Look, it was an accident.
 
ANGIE	Okay, so just so I get this right when I call the palace, you, um, threw a deadly snake at a fifth-grade teacher... insulted an African- American superstar, attempted to beat up two children, offended the entire Black community and knocked out a nun. What am I forgetting here?
 
PAUL	Why are you calling the palace?
 
ANGIE	I'm calling the palace to cancel the knighthood, before they find out about you and do it for us. Paul, I am trying to get out of this with a teeny, tiny amount of dignity. Okay, what time is it in London right now?
 
PAUL	Oh, no, no, don't call the palace. Don't cancel the knighthood. I promised Lucy.
 
ANGIE	Okay, fine, fine. I'm just, I'm amazed that the media hasn't picked up on this story yet. And thank God she's okay, this woman, this, um, Sister…
 
PAUL	Mary Murphy.

ANGIE	Mary Murphy. And do you know why the media hasn't picked up on this story yet? Because I have been up since 2:00 AM calling every contact I know. I ...Are you even listening to me?
 
PAUL	Hm? Sure.

ANGIE	What are you ... Hey, I have been up all night calling in favours, a lot of which I am really not proud of, all so they wouldn't run this story.
 


PAUL	Oh yeah, look, I appreciate that too, but I was thinking, um, why don't you try and get me on some of the Tonight Shows.
 
ANGIE	What? No, no, forget the Tonight Shows. They're not interested. And, Paul, why do you want to draw more attention to yourself? Okay, I'll tell you what. I will hold off on calling the palace if you agree to have lunch with someone who is willing to get you off the front pages.
 
PAUL	Who?

ANGIE	A decent, respectable, dignified man.
 
PAUL	Some actor.

ANGIE	No, an acrobat. Yes, an actor.
 
PAUL	Look, I don't wanna have lunch with some actor, or I don't wanna have lunch with anybody.
 
ANGIE	Well, if you don't want me to cancel the knighthood, you're going. I mean, he's willing to sit down with you and spend time to explain what it's like to be respectful and, and someone who ...You're on TV right now, aren't you? How bad is it?

PAUL	Ah, yeah, okay, so where am I gonna have lunch with this guy?
 
ANGIE	Oh, God.

CHEVY CHASE	Paul!
 
PAUL	Ah, Chevy. This is pretty nice.
 
CHEVY CHASE	Oh yeah, nice atmosphere, great food.
 
WAITRESS	Can I ... oh my goodness! Oh...

CHEVY CHASE	Lovely to meet you.
 
WAITRESS	Oh! I just have to say, watching you perform on Saturday Night Live, make me want to become a comedian.

CHEVY CHASE	Oh, how's that working out for you?
 
WAITRESS	Well, I'm working here as a waitress, so not so great.

CHEVY CHASE	Oh, takes intense training.
 
WAITRESS	But, you know, can I please buy you a drink on the house?
 
CHEVY CHASE	Oh, that'd be lovely.
 
WAITRESS	How about a glass of Brown Brothers SMC?
 
CHEVY CHASE	Oh, I love it. Love it. Paul, what do you ...
 
PAUL	Yeah, I'll have the same thanks.
 
WAITRESS	You are aware that it's $40 a glass?
 
PAUL	Sure.

WAITRESS	Hmm.

CHEVY CHASE	You do know who this is?
 
WAITRESS	Yeah.
 
CHEVY CHASE	Wow, you've really been through the wars, haven't you?
 
PAUL	Nah, it's fine. It's my manager ...

CHEVY CHASE	People ask me constantly, how is it that I'm so loved and adored? And you know, it's actually quite easy.
 
PAUL	How?
 
CHEVY CHASE	Just win an Oscar.
 
PAUL	What did you win an Oscar for?
 
CHEVY CHASE	Caddy Shack. The first one.
 
PAUL	Uh huh.
 
CHEVY CHASE	Yeah. You win one of those suckers and you can do just about anything.
 
PAUL	Really?

WAITER	Are you okay, Mr. Chase?
 
CHEVY CHASE	Yes, you need to have these fixed. They just slid right off the table.
 
WAITER	Certainly, I'll talk to the owner about glueing them on.
 
PAUL	Um, listen. I was nominated for an Academy Award once.

CHEVY CHASE	Really? What for? Couldn't have been acting. No offense.
 
PAUL	It was for writing. Best screenplay.
 
 CHEVY CHASE	Writing, wow! I didn't know that was still a category. What's next? Best Catering?
 

RESTAURANT PATRON	Ooh! Excuse me, Mr. Chase. I am so sorry to interrupt you but I just have to say you were hilarious in The Three Amigos. Whoo, blew me away! Oh, and European Vacation. You are an amazing man.
 
CHEVY CHASE	Oh, come on now. You're being silly. We're all just human beings. I'm exactly like you. Except for the Oscar.
 
RESTAURANT PATRON	You have an Oscar?
 
CHEVY CHASE	Maybe. She's cute.

PAUL	Yeah.

ROLAND	Chevy! Are we still on for badminton?

CHEVY CHASE	Absolutely.

ROLAND	And Paul, how are you?
	
PAUL	I'm good.

JOSH	Great. We've actually been meaning to call. We've had a good think and whilst we know you're not king, if you'd just put on the hat one last time, we have a killer idea.
	
	
	
PAUL	Hmm.

ROLAND	Dundee is angry. Why is he angry?

PAUL	Hmm.

ROLAND	Wait for it ... his wife Sue is dead.
	
PAUL	Dead?

ROLAND	Eaten by a crocodile. You want revenge, you enlist the help of a gorgeous young park ranger and boom! New love interest.
	
	
	
CHEVY CHASE	Sounds great. Sounds great.

JOSH	Wanna know who plays the gorgeous park ranger? Rachel McAdams!
	
CHEVY CHASE	Wow.

JOSH	As the love interest.

PAUL	Rachel McAdams? No.

ROLAND	Oh come on! You don't like Rachel McAdams?
	
CHEVY CHASE	I love Rachel McAdams.

PAUL	She's great, okay? I'm bloody 80. She's what, 30?

JOSH	He does have a point.

ROLAND	He's right.

JOSH	Yeah.

ROLAND	She's too old.
	
PAUL	No, that's not what ...

ROLAND	Do you have the list of High School Musical?

PAUL	Yep.

JOSH	Selena Gomez!

CHEVY CHASE	Emma Watson.

JOSH	Abigail Breslin.

CHEVY CHASE	Yes!

CHEVY CHASE	Oh, really? Check please.

PAUL	Here, I'll fix it.


CHEVY CHASE	No, don't be silly. Put that away, I've got this.

PAUL	Are you sure?

CHEVY CHASE	Of course. My pleasure. With everything you have going on, it's the least I can do.
	
PAUL	Yeah, thanks.

CHEVY CHASE	Good to see ya.
	
PAUL	Thanks.
	
COUPLE MAN	Excuse me, was that Chevy Chase?

PAUL	He can sing.
 
JIM JEFFRIES	(on TV) Alright, oh yeah, look, when I first heard about the snake incident I was pretty upset cause I thought Paul Hogan was already dead. He's been away for so …I have to go on stage every time. "Is that a knife? Is this not a knife? Is that a microphone? ..."
 
REPORTER	(on TV) When asked about their close friendship, the Oscar winner Gary Oldman denied ever meeting the troubled star ...
 
JIM JEFFRIES	Well I just say (beep), he's a (beep).

REPORTER	Well, John Travolta refused (on TV) to discuss Mr. Hogan. (O.S)
JOHN TRAVOLTA	That's a very dangerous thing. (on TV)

REPORTER	However, he released a statement. "I don't care what he does, but the moment he stands on stage with my Olivia and tries to destroy our legacy, he's gone too far".

PAUL	Hey, when did you learn to play guitar?

CHASE	A couple weeks ago.

PAUL	Of course.

CHASE	You should come out. We can have a barby, play some more tunes.

PAUL	Okay.

CHASE	I've got a Spanish lesson at 8. Make sure I don't forget, all right?

PAUL	Oh, you're learning to speak Spanish?

CHASE	No. Lo estoy enseñando. No, I'm teaching it.

PAUL	Of course you are.

REPORTER	The little support Paul Hogan did once have, has disappeared completely.


CHASE	Dad, you know no one thinks this stuff, right?

PAUL	Hope not.

REPORTER	He's kind of gone off the rails, right?

JESSICA GOWER	I don't care what anyone says, I love him.

PAUL	This is alright though.

JESSICA GOWER	You know, I know he's had a lot of criticism, but I think he's really …


CHASE	She loves you!

JESSICA GOWER	… all Australians feel really proud of everything he's done.

CHASE	See? You'll be right.

JESSICA GOWER	(onTV) You know, when I was a kid, I used to hide under the blankets when he wrestled those crocodiles and the snake. And what about Indy and Paul, I mean …

REPORTER	No, no, you're talking about Steve Irwin, the crocodile hunter.

JESSICA GOWER	(onTV) Who did you ask about?

REPORTER	Crocodile Dundee. Paul Hogan.

JESSICA GOWER	Oh, him. Yeah, he's a dickhead.

VOICE	Alright alright alright, let me tell you what I think about Mr. Paul Hogan ...

LUCY	(on phone) Grandpa, have you ever had anyone not like you?
 
PAUL	Um, oh yeah, maybe, one or two people.

LUCY	(on phone) What did you do?
 
PAUL	Well, nothin'. You can't force people to like ya, love. I mean, when I started on television, one of my Auntie's was sayin to me "well, you shouldn't say that on television or you shouldn't do this, or you shouldn't look like that. People won't like ya." But, you know, some people will like you, some won't. It's ... you just be yourself.
 
LUCY	You mean I shouldn't let people know you're my Grandpa because you've been upsetting them forever?
 
PAUL	Ha ha. It's probably the safest thing is not to mention me. Listen, your mum said the new school is a bit tough for you.
 
LUCY	Yeah.
 
PAUL	Oh well look, it's not easy when you go to a new school but you'll be fine.

LUCY	Yeah.
 
PAUL	Listen, I'm sorry if any of this stuff that's being reported about me makes it a bit hard for you, but just don't worry about it. You know, they make stuff up.

LUCY	That's what my mum says.
 
PAUL	Oh well, mum gets confused sometimes.

LUCY	But don't worry Grandpa, you're getting a knighthood. That'll make up for all of it. No one can take that away.
 
PAUL	Oh, I hope not.
 
LUCY	Ah, I drew this.
 
PAUL	Oh, did you do that? You're really talented for a 19 year old kid.

LUCY	I'm not 19, I'm 9!
 
PAUL	You can't be 9. You're too smart.
 
LUCY	Thanks, but I just wanted to show you that. I better go, the wizard awaits.
 
PAUL	Oh, yeah. How's that going? How's that working out?
 
LUCY	Pretty good. I can't wait for you to watch me sometime.
 
PAUL 	Oh, I'd love to see it.

LUCY	Bye, Pa.
 
PAUL	Mmm, bye sweetie. Hey, I can see your foot sticking out. Come on, what are we doing? Playing hide and seek?

LUKE	No, we're not.
	
PAUL	So what are you doing here, mate?

LUKE	Well, I couldn't find Melrose.

PAUL	Oh alright, let's get it over with. How much will you get for a photo of me?

LUKE	Oh, like a hundred bucks.

PAUL	A hundred bucks?!

LUKE	Yeah, I mean, that's if I'm lucky.

PAUL	What about if I took my shirt off and I'm all sweaty, you know, coming out of the gym all pumped up?

LUKE	Oh, no, sixty maybe.

PAUL	Sixty!

LUKE	Mm-hmm.

PAUL	Okay, um, what about a photo of me with Kim Kardashian?

LUKE	Now we're talking! That would be amazing! I could get like three grand, maybe even more. Well, I mean, that's just for a photo of Kim though. Are you in it too?
	
PAUL	Yeah.
	
LUKE	Then it's like $120, or less.
	
PAUL	Oh.

LUKE	But don't worry, I can crop you out of it. I got an idea, Paul. What if I like got photos of you and like a new girlfriend.

PAUL	No.

LUKE	No, it could be good. It doesn't have to be a girlfriend, maybe like ... a lover.
	
PAUL	Forget about it.

LUKE	We could set that up. You know, I just met a waitress at Denny's and she was really into Australians. I was like, ohhh, I know an Australian.

PAUL	Alright, listen. You don't have a car, do you?
 
LUKE	Yeah I ... no, I don't.

PAUL	Mmmm, okay.
 
LUKE	Why?
 
PAUL	I, no, I better not. No, I promised my manager I wouldn't get in to any more trouble.
 
LUKE	Paul, do the opposite. Do whatever you said you wouldn't do to your manager. Do the opposite of that. Let's do it! We'll do it together. Paul, please! Please, please.
 
PAUL	Oh …

JOHN CLEESE	So, where are we going?
 
LUKE	We need to find stars.

PAUL	Yeah, you know, like George Clooney, Julia Roberts …

LUKE	Kim Kardashian.
 
JOHN CLEESE	I ... I used to know where Carey Grant lived.

PAUL	Yeah, but ah ... I think it's better if we stick to celebrities that are still alive.

JOHN CLEESE	Okay. Betty White?

	
LUKE	Ahhh, I mean she's good, it's just ...

JOHN CLEESE	What night is it?
	
PAUL	Uh, Wednesday, I think.

JOHN CLEESE	Ah, well, I know where they are.

LUKE	Yeah? Crap.

PAUL	Don't panic. It's just the police.

LUKE	Yeah, but they got big guns.

PAUL	Yeah, but if you don't do anything stupid, they're fine.

LUKE	What are you doing?

JOHN CLEESE	Just uh, I'm just waiting for them ... to get … out of the car. Oh, I forgot. Do you guys want mints or water or anything?
 
PAUL	Uh, I'm fine for now, John.

LUKE	What? No! Listen Buddy, you gotta pull over and talk to them!
 
JOHN CLEESE	Ah, no, no, I can't. I don't have my driver's license.
 
LUKE	You can just tell them you left it at home.

JOHN CLEESE	No, I don't have 'a' driving license. Come to think of it, I don't even know whose car this is.
 
LUKE	Come on! John!
 
JOHN CLEESE	Get your camera out.
 
LUKE	Why? So I can photograph my own death?
 
JOHN CLEESE	No, cause just around this corner, there's going to be a mother lode of celebrities.
 
LUKE	Paul! Lens cap! Lens cap!

E.N. REPORTER	Stephanie, tell us about your latest role.

STEPHANIE	She's a hard nosed FBI agent that needs a lot of people killed.

E.N. REPORTER	Oh, how fun.
 
STEPHANIE	Yes.

E.N. REPORTER	There seems to be some kind of disturbance happening.
	
NEWS REPORTER	Oh, this chase is getting out of control. Police are advising drivers to avoid Santa Vicente Boulevard.
 
JOHN CLEESE	I never get tired of searchlights.
 
PAUL	Now Luke, stay alert. Kim Kardashian, 2 o'clock.

LUKE	Can you slow down a bit?

JOHN CLEESE	Afraid that won't be possible.
 
PAUL	Oh look! There's Brad Pitt. Oh, did ya get him?
 
LUKE	No.
 
JOHN CLEESE	I nearly did.
 
PAUL	Yeah, we noticed.

MAN	Ahhhhh ...

PAUL	Oh oh, what was that?
 
LUKE	I think it was Harvey Weinstein. Shit.
 
E.N. REPORTER	While they can't make out who's driving, that is certainly Paul Hogan in the passenger seat.
 

NEWS REPORTER	Well, drivers are now in a panic. The chase has moved to the other side of the road.

JOHN CLEESE	Thanks guys. Don't forget to rate me, five stars. (laughs)
	
LUKE	Hey, where's he going?

PAUL	Quick! Inside.

LUKE	Hey, you really think that was Kim Kardashian?

PAUL	Get inside the ...


LUKE	Ohhhh, your place is gorgeous!

PAUL	Come here!

LUKE	You got three garages?! Have you got three cars?

PAUL	Move!

LUKE	Or is it just storage? Ohhhh, you got a tennis court! That's awesome! I played tennis in high school. I'm actually pretty good for my size. Oh, look at the size of these doors.

PAUL	Get in, get in.

LUKE	Whoa, look at this place! You got chairs, coffee table, a huge dining table. You got like eight pillows.

NEWS REPORTER	… has been surrounded ...

PAUL	Look at that. Is it wind?

LUKE	Ahh you got a pool? You got a TV.

LUKE	Paul. Paul! You're on the news!

NEWS REPORTER	This maybe the saddest thing this jaded old journalist has ever seen.
 
LUKE	Paul. Paul. Paul! You're on the news!

You think your little toy is going to fill me with dread But you should take that home and file your toenails instead You're embarrassing yourself in front of my future wife Cause that's not a knife You should turn away from your life of crime Do something more worthwhile with your time Probably why you're looking so deflated Maybe cause the implement is not serrated I can see you're not the sharpest tool in the shed But I wouldn't use that little thing to butter my bread Kid if I were you I'd bloody run for my life Cause that's not a knife - that's not a knife No, that's not a knife - that's not a knife No that's not a knife That's a knife

POLICEMAN	Hey, Hogan, you made bail.

PAUL		Oh look, in my defence, I had no idea we'd be trying to escape from the cops in a televised high speed pursuit, with an unlicensed John Cleese driving a stolen car.
 
 NEWS ANCHOR	It is certainly the story that won't go away, as disgraced racist, nun basher and former Australian legend, Paul Hogan, implodes before our very eyes.

LONDON REPORTER	Yeah, fair, pretty silly, but I've got to admit, I'm actually surprised by how funny he is.

TV REPORTER	Australian Paul HoGun! I've got one, I've got one. What does Paul say when he'd like the escort to leave?
 
WAYNE	Uhhh, uhhh, Carol's here! I don't know how she found me. You haven't seen me.

PAUL	Mate, your timing couldn't be worse.
 
WAYNE	Just tell her you haven't seen me.

PAUL	I can't lie to Carol. She's an angel.

WAYNE	No matter what she says, you have no idea where I am. Good luck! Ee aa yaaa ... Please God, please I beg you.

PAUL	Oh bloody hell.

LONDON REPORTER #2	Wait, I've got one. What do you call Paul Hogan's latest movie?

MEL GIBSON	I don't know.

TV REPORTER	Who cares?
	
CAROL	Oh.

PAUL	Oh. Hi Carol.

CAROL	Hi Paul. Ah, these are for you.

PAUL	Oh, thank you.

CAROL	I thought it's the least that I could do with you having to put up with him and all that noise.

PAUL	Mmm, ah, put up with what?
	
CAROL	What? With Wayne.

PAUL	Wayne?

CAROL	Where is he, Paul?

PAUL	Who?

CAROL	Wayne.


PAUL	Wayne? Oh, I haven't seen him.

CAROL	Really? Oh.


PAUL	Yeah.

CAROL	Paul, I'm gonna need you to be honest with me.

PAUL	Yeah, of course.

CAROL	Have you seen my husband?

PAUL	Wayne? Uh, no.

CAROL	Okay, ummm, I'm sorry.

PAUL	Oh no, that's okay. Knowing Wayne, he's probably ...

WAYNE	Sorry sweetheart. New show jitters. You know how I am.

CAROL	You lying little ...

PAUL	But hey, he told me …

WAYNE	Hey, whoa whoa whoa whoa Buddy, don't look at me. I mean, you gave it away the minute you opened the door, you looked so guilty.


CAROL	I am very disappointed with you.

WAYNE	That makes two of us. Yeah, I read the press. I was going to leave anyway. Oh and I'd give that robe a wash.
 
CAROL	Uh yes, wa wa wa, muah.

WAYNE	Bye.
 
TV REPORTER	One thing that is safe to say... is the once loved Mr. Dundee doesn't have a friend left in the world.

ANGIE	Got a letter from the palace.

PAUL	Oh, well I guess we both know what this says.

ANGIE	Yeah, I think so.

PAUL	Huh, I don't know how I'm going to tell Lucy though.
	People are just so angry at me.

ANGIE	I don't know what I'm gonna tell my mom. I wish my dad was here. He'd know what to do.

PAUL	Hey, you did a great job. You were just trying to manage a boofhead.
	
ANGIE	Well I was managing a boofhead.

PAUL	Yeah. You gonna be okay?

ANGIE	Yeah. You know, I've always wanted to make something for kids.

PAUL	You should.

ANGIE	Yeah, I'll find something. I wasn't really much of a manager anyway.

ELLA	Hello, Paul.
 
PAUL	Oh.

ELLA	I'm Ella.
	
PAUL	Hi, I'm Paul.
	
ELLA	Hello.
	
PAUL	Hello Ella.

	
ELLA	Hi. Oh, goodness. The others aren't here yet
.
PAUL	Uh, no.
	
ELLA	Oh, sorry, gosh, that's me. How rude. Sorry.

PAUL	That's fine.
	
ELLA	Oh, it's Livvy. Um, oh. "Running late, be there soon."
		
PAUL	Uh huh.
	
ELLA	Right. Do you get the feeling this is a set up?

PAUL	I'm starting to, yes.
	
ANGIE	Oh dear.
	
PAUL	Ah Livvy, I'll kill her. I love your dress.

ANGIE	It's a top. But thank you.
 
PAUL	Of course it's a top.

ANGIE	Oh my goodness ... these things are always awkward, aren't they?
 
PAUL	What?

ANGIE	Dates.

PAUL	Actually I wouldn't know. I haven't been on a date since man walked on the moon. Half a century ago.

ANGIE	Goodness. If it took you another half century to go on a date, it must have been a bad one.
 
PAUL	It was pretty bad actually.

ANGIE	Well, anyway, I'm glad you're here.
 
PAUL	I'm glad too.

ANGIE	Oh my goodness, I think that's Chevy Chase.
 
CHEVY CHASE	Just slid right off the table.
 
PAUL	Of course it's him.

ANGIE	He's pretty good. He won an Academy Award.
	
PAUL	Oh, really?

CHEVY	You need to have these

CHASE	fixed.

PAUL	Oh, I didn't know that.

LE-BELLE WAITER	Good evening. Could I interest you in a wine list this evening?

PAUL	Oh yeah, yes please.

LE-BELLE WAITER	Certainly sir.

PAUL	Thank you.
	
ANGIE	Um, is it okay if I make a tiny little confession?

PAUL	Yeah.

ANGIE	I may not be an innocent bystander in all of this. I might have had a conversation with Olivia before hand.

PAUL	Ah ha. I'll be having a little chat to Olivia.
	
VICTIM	He's got my keys! Stop him! Somebody stop him!
	
PAUL	Ah.

ANGIE	Are you okay?

PAUL	Yeah, back in a sec.
 
VICTIM	Over there! Stop him, somebody stop him! It's the phantom valet! I know it! Somebody stop him!

CROWD	(clapping and cheering)

ET REPORTER	Like a scene from the movie itself, much loved Aussie star, Paul Hogan, is back  and reminding us of what he is truly made of.

PAUL	I've still got it.
	
ANGIE	Not bad!
		
ET REPORTER	Like a scene from the movie itself, much loved Aussie star, Paul Hogan, is back  and reminding us of what he is truly made of. However, the same cannot be said for another comedy icon. Chevy Chase, whose downfall has begun as he was dragged from an L.A. eatery for displacing condiments. The troubled star was heard to be screaming "But I won and Oscar!" Wait, he won an Oscar?

SONG LYRICS	Cut through glaciers to coastlines by the afternoon rivers cut through the gorge the waters clean and the waters smooth, I've been trying to move along, move along, consumed in keeping strong for far too long when all I had to do was rest my head

LADY	Your photo was amazing!

SONG LYRICS	You don't have to feel like this, you don't have to feel like this
 

LUKE'S MUM	I can't believe you pulled this together. To be honest, I always thought you wouldn't amount to much.

LUKE	Thank you, mom.

SONG LYRICS	I'm letting go I've been trying to hold on…

ROLAND	How'd he get the idea?

JOSH	He is a genius.
 
PAUL	Hello?

ANGIE	Hey, how's it going back there?

PAUL  	Oh, I'm all set.
 
ANGIE	It's pretty amazing out here too. I've never seen so much privilege in one place.
 
PAUL	I hope your mom fits right in.

ANGIE	She does. Can you believe they changed their minds?
 
PAUL	Yeah.

ANGIE	Oh, I better let you go.

PAUL	No.
 
EARL OF WINDSOR	It is with tremendous excitement and gratitude that today we honour Mr. Paul Hogan. The star of her Majesty's favourite movie, Crocodile Dundee 3. Unfortunately Mr. Hogan couldn't be here today as he had somewhere important to be.

RICHARD WILKINS	And Paul Hogan is back in the news after failing to show up to an appearance on the Tonight Show.
 
LUCY	Grandpa!! You made it!
 
PAUL	Oh yeah, wouldn't want to miss this.
	
LUCY	Is it true?
 
PAUL	Yeah, I'm really here.
 
LUCY	But, what about Chase?

EARL OF WINDSOR	And accepting on Mr. Hogan's behalf, Miss Angie Douglas.
 
POLICE RADIO	With the subject now heading Eastwards towards the 405, all officers, be warned, it is John Cleese.

ELLA	Hello.

PAUL	Oh hi. You found the place.

ELLA	You gave great directions. Ahhh, hello, hello.

PAUL	He's a little sweetie, isn't he?

ELLA	Hello. Oh my goodness, hi. Oh wow. Oh my goodness. Hello gorgeous, hello. What's her name?

PAUL	Paddy.

ELLA	Hello Paddy. Wow, how lucky are we? Oh it's so gorgeous here!

LUCY	Come and play, Grandpa!
 
PAUL	Oh later, sweetheart. I gotta have my power nap.
 
LUCY	Okay.

PAUL	Okay.
 
WAYNE	(singing)(O.S) Hello ma baby, hello ma honey, hello ma rag time gal Send me a kiss by wire Baby my hearts on fire If you refuse me, honey you'll lose me
 
PAUL	Oh shit.

WAYNE	And then you'll be left alone (singing)(O.S) Oh baby telephone and tell me I'm your own.

PAUL	Now that's a … really dumb way to shave.
