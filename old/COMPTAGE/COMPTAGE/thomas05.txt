(TWO WHEELS GOOD)

THOMAS	Hello, everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...Everyone being useful 

THOMAS	When Mr Percival said that his bicycle's two wheels were best, we all disagreed.. 

THOMAS	We all thought we had the best number of wheels. Bertie thought his four wheels were best, I thought my six wheels were best. Spencer had twenty wheels!

THOMAS	...But he ran into trouble when he tried to take the Duke and Duchess to Callan Castle. 

THOMAS	I tried to help, but the track was blocked, so Bertie came to the rescue. 

THOMAS	But, one of Bertie's four wheels burst a tyre and so Harold quickly flew the Duke and Duchess to the Castle!

THOMAS	This proved it didn't matter how many wheels we have, we could each help the Duke and Duchess on their journey.  

THOMAS	Everyone has a strength and can be Really Useful. We just need to find that special thing we're good at!
