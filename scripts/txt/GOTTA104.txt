(SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT)
("#LUVIZLUV (SEXUALITY IS FLUID")
(Episode #104)




NOLA	Enough is enough. There are way too many Toxins in my Life. I need a Break and some Radical Self-Care. And when I say Radical, I mean Radical. Treating myself to an Internal Cleanse that really gets the Stink out. That means no Social Media, no Weed, no Alcohol, and no Men in my Loviní Bed. Ya heard? NO MEN. Nada. None. Zip. Zero. Not even Virtual. Donít think I can do it? Watch. But that donít mean I canít Smash Thoí.


OPAL	I met Nola what, like 2 years ago, Right here in my Nursery. She didnít buy anything that day. Really good energy with her. Smart, Gorgeous, plus sheís an Artist and Shit. How can you not be attracted to that? Things were growing between us and then we Hit that point where youíre Exclusive or youíre Done. And Nola Benched me. Actually, it was more of a Slow Ghost, a Fade to Friend Zone then out. I didnít think sheíd step back into my Life again but suddenly Iím back in her Loviní Bed and itís On and Poppiní. Now, Iím not trying to Catch any Feelings since I got burned last time but Iím Single so might as well ride the Wave...

OPAL	That was written by Skylarís Sperm Donor.

NOLA	Damn. That Guy is your Daughterís Biodad?


OPAL	I told you about him when you first met Skylar.

NOLA	Right, right, I just didnít make the connection. Wow. My Mom gave me this Book for Christmas.

OPAL	Remember the part when she says She Loves him but he canít hear her because the Train is passing by? Itís just so...You never read it. Itís Heavy but itís hysterical. And you will Ugly Cry.

NOLA	How much is He in her Life?

OPAL	We visit him once or twice a year. Heís in Cali, married another friend of ours from Sarah Lawrence. Now that heís got his own Family sheís got some Half-Sibs to order around.


 
NOLA	Whatís Skylar reading these days?

OPAL	I Am Malala. And a Vegan cookbook.

NOLA	Light reading. Iíd be into illustrating Childrenís Books one day. Hey, we could do one together about Horticulture.

OPAL	A Pop Up Book so you could see the Plants grow...

NOLA	...or a Coloring Book that comes with a packet of real Seeds you could plant.

OPAL	Wait! Scratch and Sniff!

NOLA	Whatís Scratch and Sniff?

OPAL	You donít remember those Books?

NOLA	Un uh.

OPAL	You Scratch say, a Strawberry on the page and it starts to smell like a Pink Starburst. Probably illegal now. Allergies.

NOLA	Yeah, that sounds very Pre-War on Terror. Think Skylar would read this?

OPAL	Thatís totally her Skylar.

NOLA	Iíd offer to get it for her but Iím kinda Tight right now.

OPAL	A young Artist living in Fort Greene low on Cash? I donít believe you.

NOLA	How bout a Bookmark? Since itís Free .99...Iím starting a new Teaching Artist Job tomorrow that actually pays well and just in time because even with all my other hustles, my rent is late! I applied for this Catlett Prize too. Waiting to hear if I made the next round. Money is coming, Money is coming, Money is coming.

OPAL AND NOLA	Money is Coming, Money is Coming...


OPAL	Isnít the Group Show youíre in going up soon? How are you feeling about it?

NOLA	I donít know, I donít know ... My Work is my solace these days, but I still feel like something hasnít clicked....Iíve been Painting Portraits lately which isnít inherently groundbreaking. But you look at Artists like LaToya Ruby Frazier, Kehinde Wiley, Mickalene Thomas, even my friend Terrell Boyce...theyíve got a fresh take on Portraiture. Theyíre Honest and unafraid of the Beauty of the Black Body and how it can be represented. And they have all the right theoretical language around their Art for it to Fly...Iím trying to hit that same Sweet Spot with my work.

OPAL	Do you wanna come over for Dinner? Tonight?

NOLA	Tonight? Tonight?

OPAL	We can pick Skylar up from Rock Climbing after I close up shop and Iíll make Dinner at my place. Free Food.

OPAL	Itís a spontaneous plan. You like those right?

NOLA	Yeah, I Love the idea but I have Therapy, oh, pretty much now and this thing tonight with my Friend Terrell I canít bail on...Iím just trying to stick to what I say Iím gonna do.

OPAL	Well, youíre always welcome. Any time youíre Free.

OPAL	Okay, your pouty face is too cute.

NOLA	Why are you so dope? I have to go, Beautiful. (Can I give this to Sky?) See you soon!

OPAL	Like  wouldnít wanna be you?

NOLA	No, Silly. Soon. Super soon!

NOLA	This Woman is like Whoa. I am legit feeling her. I feel so Safe. I mean I donít believe in Labels but as a Sex Positive Polyamorous Pansexual, this is the first time ideas like Monogamy and Family have ever seemed like a remote possibility. She owns her own nursery. Sheís a Horticulturalist. So Hot, right? I can talk about my Work with her. My Parents would Love her. And sheís got a Kid already from a Turkey Baster with her Friend from College, so I get Insta-Daughter without Labor or Stretch Marks! I can see the Three of us skipping down the Street all happy like weíre in some Commercial for a product only White Folks would buy. The Key is that unlike the Men Iíve been dealing with, she is not trying to own me. Real Talk.

DR. JAMISON	ÒReal Talk.Ó Thatís what weíre aiming for at all times in here.

NOLA	Right. And her Ego isnít massive so I have space to be myself. Am I gushing too much?

DR. JAMISON	No, itís Great, these passionate feelings. Do you feel more at Home with an Intimate Partner of the same Sex?

NOLA	I donít think about it that way. Itís just about whether Iím into the Person.

DR. JAMISON	Youíre just more Open and at Ease having rekindled this particular relationship.

NOLA	I am. Plus the tools you suggested have been helping. The breathing, wearing that dress, visualizing safe spaces...and I need them all because I feel like I have been under attack from every direction. But with Opal I donít have to fight back all the time. Oh, Thank You. I never see these Tissues....I barely know whatís going on. Why am I Crying when I actually feel better?

DR. JAMISON	Tears are another form of Real Talk. Youíre releasing. Your physical trauma might have abated but the emotional trauma lasts longer. Itís activating deeper issues.

NOLA	Maybe itís this Saturn Return thing? I keep seeing People post about it.

DR. JAMISON	You mean because youíre twenty- seven. Youíre right. At your age, you feel a lot of pressure in every dimension of your life. Career, Money, Relationships with Family, Lovers, Friends, finding your True Purpose...it can be a Struggle. But be gentle on yourself as circumstances force you to make choices. You can always start from wherever you are. And take Heart that by entering this transition with awareness youíre already Miles ahead. Weíll pause here until next time. How did you want to Pay Today, Cash or Check?


NOLA	Oh yeah, I meant to tell you I got this new Gig to Pay the Bills.

DR. JAMISON	Thatís good news. Something exciting?

NOLA	Itís a Teaching Artist thing, but for a longer stretch than Iíve done before. Hope it doesnít stretch into forever because it is not my Dream Job. My Dream is to have No Job. But I donít get paid offa that for a sec so I was hoping I could open up a tab or something? I see you have great taste in Art. Maybe I could paint your a portrait.

DR. JAMISON	Iíll think about it.

NOLA	Mekka Mekka Woodpecka!!! Mekka Lekka Hi, Mekka Hi Dee Ho! Hello? Hello?

SHEMEKKA	Hola Nola. How you Durrin?

NOLA	Staying Black, Staying Alive.

SHEMEKKA	Honey, why donít you get ready for bed. Iíll be right there to tuck you in.

NADIA	Donít be long.

SHEMEKKA	Right after I finish with you God Mommy Nola.

NOLA	You actually went and did it? You got your Butt did? Let me see.

SHEMEKKA	I was scared to tell you, Darling, but now that I got Back, I couldnít hide it if I tried. Check the silhouette.

NOLA	Oooooh! What???? That is your butt, now?

SHEMEKKA	Evidently. She was always screaming to get out.

NOLA	I donít know what to say.

SHEMEKKA	Say Congratulations.

NOLA	Congratulations. What does Nadia think?

SHEMEKKA	She thinks its pretty like mePretty Hurts but itís worth it, Nola. Now what is your latest Tea, my Dove, spill it.

NOLA	No news like yours. Um...taking a Testosterone Break. Hanginí out with Opal again.

SHEMEKKA	Oh, the Horticulturalist is back in rotation. Well, if she has a Brother, hook me up!

NOLA	 (Ad lib)

SHEMEKKA	You a hater.

DJ	I know youíre haviní a good time for Georgeís retirement party. Let me hear it for George!

TERRELL	Do not make me break a Sweat!

NOLA	I did not know how much I needed to Get Down! Terrell, do you hear that Beat? This DJ is Everything!

TERRELL	I still have to introduce you to my Parents. Letís go over now. You look Beautiful Mama.

VILMA	Hello Son.

TERRELL	Congratulations Papa.

NOLA	Congratulations!

GEORGE	Thanks. You work for the City like I did, you can pay for a Retirement Party like this.

TERRELL	Iím doing just fine with my Art.

GEORGE	Weíll see. And who is this Lovely Creature?

TERRELL	These are my Parents, George and Vilma.

NOLA	Iím Nola Darling. Nice to meet you.

TERRELL	Nola is my new Girlfriend.

VILMA	Sheís very pretty.

NOLA	Iím not his Girlfriend.

TERRELL	Thatís what she thinks.

NOLA	But we are Close.

TERRELL	True. True.

NOLA	And you all are really close.

GEORGE AND VILMA	Sometimes.

NOLA	But Thirty-Eight years, thatís even longer than my Parents. How did you know that you were right for each other?

GEORGE	Well. I was working at the New York City Department of Finance.

VILMA	And I was working at the New York City Department of Labor.

GEORGE	And we met in the Intramural Cricket League. (West Indian Day Parade.)

NOLA	You just...knew?

VILMA	Of course. We met and it was clear we'd be Marrying. I donít understand your question.

NOLA	You disappeared and left me with your Parents. To Dance? Canít you Dance inside? Hey Stefano.

TERRELL	What is that in your hand? You said you have to be up early for work.

NOLA	Doesnít matter. Itís just a day job.

TERRELL	I thought you werenít drinking right now.

NOLA	I had to! Otherwise theyíd think I was an Alcoholic.

STEFANO	She had Rum Cake too.

NOLA	Because Nigelís Father made it himself. Your Folks are amazing.

TERRELL	After a few minutes with them I feel like Iím going to Choke. My Father has no respect for what I do. My Art.

NOLA	At least he knows youíre an Artist. But how could you straight up lie and say I was your Girlfriend? Will you tell this Fiancé of yours that he is a Grown Ass Man and he should be out to his Parents? Why is he hiding you?

TERRELL	Ding. Clearly I need to reach you. Class Bell. Okay, my Parents? Old School Caribbean, People. Whatís worse than having Great Gallery Representation and a Residency at the Studio Museum and Collectors? Being a Batty Boy! And a Batty Boy ,like me gets disowned if he survives at all.

STEFANO	Itís the same deal with my Parents. Italians are like Uomo, No Homo.

NOLA	But youíve been together forever. None of your Parents know about you Guys?

STEFANO	If you tasted my Fatherís Gnocchi, youíd understand. Itís too good to risk it.

TERRELL	You have some nerve telling me to be a Grown Ass Man when you are dating Three Guys and a Woman and go into Anaphylactic Shock just hearing the word Commitment. See? You can only be a Fake Girlfriend, not a real one.

NOLA	So I have to be a Good Girl and get married off to count in your Book? Ridiculous. Plus Iím not Dating Three Men.

TERRELL	Not tonight. Because youíre on a ÒCleanse.Ó

NOLA	Iím doing what makes me Feel Good and thatís Opal right now.

TERRELL	Youíre too Greedy, you canít stick to one thing for long.

NOLA	Please. I can try to, to, you know, at least...to someone.

TERRELL	Commit? When you canít even say it?

NOLA	Do you all hear this? Canít we go inside and Dance?

STEFANO	We can Dance out here.

NOLA	Inside is better. They wonít know. Iíll say youíre my Friend, Stefano. I wanna Dance with somebody like this. Do I have to put a Ring on it for that?

VILMA	Gay to The G, dat Boy.

NOLA	Where are my Keys? Noooooo... Miss Ella, this is Nola Darling, your Tenant. Iím outside and ... your God Daughter. Can you let me in? I know you hear me. But you have no Mercy.

BIANCA	I suffer from insomnia and now you.

PAPO	My Bad, my Bad.

BIANCA	Your Garbage ÒArtÓ is a Health Hazard and Iím going to call the Police if you donít leave my Property.

PAPO	Okay Lady, you can Dead all that. Iím Ghost. What you doiní walkiní by yourself on these Skreets?

NOLA	Going to my Parentsí house. Iím locked out.

PAPO	Iíll walk you. Tu Sabes Como Hacen Los Guerreros. And after my Tour, goiní to the same place every day to work me Movió Loco. So then I couldnít pay my Rent or my Child Support, and I was assed out. Thatís me. You making Pieces these days?

NOLA	Yeah. Pieces of Pieces. Alright Papo, Thanks for walking me.

PAPO	No doubt. Iíll stay here Ôtil you get in. Whaddup Sis?

NOLA	I donít want to Wake Them Up.

PAPO	They wouldnít want you out on the Street tonight.

NOLA	Iím an Adult, right? I can figure something out.

PAPO	Everybody needs help, Mamí.

NOLA	I like this Piece a lot.

PAPO	Take it.

NOLA	How much is it?

PAPO	Naw. We Chill like dat. Unless you got like Twenty Dollars so I can get some Food?

NOLA	I only have Ten Dollars on me.

PAPO	Esta bueno. Thatís Cool.

NOLA	I wish I could give you more. Iím telling you, you were the Best Artist in our School. The Best. Numero Uno.

PAPO	Gracias Morena Pero Ese Vida No Pareció En Mis Cartas. Wasnít in the Cards. My Mama used to say that. So you still ainít got no keys. Whatchu gon do?

NOLA	Shemekka, Shemekka, pick up...

DANTON	Oh God Oh God not now not now hang up the phone!

CLORINDA	Uh huh!

NOLA	Clo? Oh, are you having Sex? Thatís Great.

CLORINDA	Yeah! What do you want?

NOLA	Iím locked out but youíre busy so...

CLORINDA	... Thatís right! Call one of your Dick-Ma-Tists instead!

NOLA	Iím actually not dealing with any Penis right now.

TERRELL	Are you still drunk?

NOLA	Terrell. Where are you?

TERRELL	Broome Street. Aka Doom Street. We are almost into the Holland Tunnel back to Jersey but this Traffic is like a Fuckiní Roland Emmerich Disaster Movie out here.

NOLA	I lost my Keys. Did you see them anywhere?

TERRELL	Again? Nola, how Old are you? Do you even care about yourself? Get your Life together so you can do your Work, Ôcuzó

NOLA	Thank You for your Kind Shade.

OPAL	I thought you were with some Boy tonight.

NOLA	I told you Iím on a Man Break. I was with my boy Terrell and heís Gay to the G.

OPAL	Well he could be playing for both Teams like you. I get very intolerant of the Bicurious this late at night. Would you take your Heels off so you donít Wake Up Skylar, please?

NOLA	Iím taking off my shoes!

OPAL	Whatís that? Smells like Hot Trash.

NOLA	Oh. An old Schoolmate sold this to me. So Talented and Homeless. We call him the Mayor of Fort Greene. If you ever catch me selling my Art on the Street, you better slap me or something. Hope I can get inside my Apartment before Class for my Lesson Plan.

OPAL	I keep Farmerís hours, up with the Sun. Iíll wake you. The Bathroom is that door, remember? You can wash up. Hereís a Towel.

NOLA	Itís Hello Kitty? I Love Hello Kitty. When I use a Towel, I Feel Clean! Towel!

OPAL	Iíll be in the living room.

OPAL	Morning Sky.

SKYLAR	Good morning.

OPAL	You remember my Friend Nola?

SKYLAR	Possibly. Are you Mommyís new Girlfriend? She only lets Women stay over if itís serious.

OPAL	You need to show your manners and say Hello before any Interrogations.

SKYLAR	Hi.

NOLA	Hi Skylar. Water.

SKYLAR	Mommy likes to go for a Run in the morning when thereís someone to keep an Eye on me. Wanna go running Mommy? Nola and I can make Breakfast.

OPAL	Thatís considerate of you. Nola, are you sure you can Eat and Walk with us to School before all your work stuff?

NOLA	Yeah, isnít it Dawn? I have three hours. Plenty of time.

OPAL	Do you really want to stay here alone with Skylar while I Run?

NOLA	If thatís what Skylar wants.

SKYLAR	Thatís why I suggested it.

OPAL	Alright then. Have Fun. Call me if you need me.

NOLA	So what are we making here?

SKYLAR	Oatmeal. Vegan. My Mother, however, starts her Day by eating the unborn eggs of Caged Birds. She can make those herself.

NOLA	What made you go Vegan?

SKYLAR	It was an easy Commitment. I just didnít want to eat anything that ran away from me. Did you measure the Oatmeal water?

NOLA	Nah, with Oatmeal I do it by feel.

SKYLAR	That was a rhyme.

NOLA	I got more for you if you give me some time.

SKYLAR	I remember you.

NOLA	And I remember you. I thought I was the tardy one, youíre going to make Skylar late for ñ

OPAL	Weíre coming, Skylar?

SKYLAR	Coming, Mommy.

OPAL	Nice Birks.

NOLA	You donít mind I borrowed them?

OPAL	Got your lunch? Math Homework?

SKYLAR	Check.

NOLA	So this is what morning feels like at the Gilstrap house?

OPAL	Basically.

SKYLAR	Nola, will you come over again tonight? Before my Bedtime?

NOLA	Check! We can make Dream Catchers!

OPAL	You made her happy.

NOLA	Why are you the ideal Woman? And how weird is it that Iím spending the morning with someone Iím Dating? I never do that.

GREER	Nola.

NOLA	Greer.

OPAL	Opal.

NOLA	This is Greer, Opal. Opal, Greer.

OPAL	I got that.

NOLA	What are you doing in Fort Greene?

GREER	Personal Training Client over here. She liked how I looked so she wanted the regimen for herself. Such a treat to see you, Stranger.

OPAL	I gotta go talk to Gardell.

GREER	So how long is this break of yours going to last? I know you got mad after our impromptu Photo Shoot so...how Ôbout some Angry Morning Sex? With a safe word we can get Pretty Wild.

NOLA	Greer, I need something more than Sex. Oh my God, I have to go. I will let you know when Iím ready to see you.

GREER	You do that. And Stay Fine. Looking good in those Birks!

NOLA	That was unexpected.

OPAL	Yup. It felt like you were ashamed of me.

NOLA	Iím not.

OPAL	You get to be a Tri-Sexual and try anything. Itís different when youíre like me and you donít have a choice. But if you donít want to be seen with a Woman in front of one of your Dudes, I get it.

NOLA	Itís not Personal. And itís not Anti-Political. I just donít put my Bed out in the Street.

OPAL	Are you still going to try to get into your Apartment?

NOLA	No try, do. Hey everybody! Are you Raqueletta Moss?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Raqueletta Moss is present. And on time. But Nola Darling is 16 minutes late.

NOLA	What? I thought I was supposed to be here at 915.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Is that what you thought? How artistic of you. We start at 9am sharp and it is 916. Nope. 17.

REGGIE	She late as Hell, yíall!

RAQUELETTA MOSS	But because Studies show that any sort of Arts exposure is very good at increasing Attendance, Morale, and Test Scores in all Subjects, and because our Motto is...

RAQUELE. + STUDENTS	With Love, Compassion, Discipline: We. Expect. Success!Ó

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Iím going to reach into my pocket of generosity and let Nola Darling teach with the knowledge that this tardy behavior will never. Happen. Again. You have your Lesson Plan? Begin. Raqueletta Moss out.

NOLA	Who needs a Lesson Plan? Letís just Flow today. Have any of you ever been late before? None of you? How Ôbout your Friends or Siblings? Anyone you know? No one makes mistakes here. Got it. So what does a World without mistakes look like? What Shapes and Colors does it have? Show me.

REGGIE	You want me to draw on the Chalkboard?

NOLA	No. Draw on me.

REGGIE	Can I draw on your Hair?

NOLA	And then we made found object Sculptures with whatever we could scavenge in the Classroom.

SEPTIMA	Iím impressed you made it through your First Day after the late start and the Key debacle. But you really should have rung the Bell last night.

NOLA	Trying to grow up, Mom.

SEPTIMA	Put the Keys around your Neck or something. This Woman Opal you stayed with, whatís she like?

NOLA	Sheís like a Lodestone. Like the Center of a Compass. Like something I can count on.

SEPTIMA	Reading you Toni Morrison at Bedtime paid off.

NOLA	I need more steadiness in my Life. Maybe I could try being exclusive with her.

SEPTIMA	This Woman must have Witch Pussy.

NOLA	No, thatís what I got, Mom. I have the Witch Pussy. You better Recognize.

SEPTIMA	No, You better Recognize where you think you got your Witch Pussy From! I did this play Downtown at La Mama with Ellen Stewart where I had a Love Scene with this Woman. I thought she was Cute and so did she but Kissing her was like Making Out with some Jiffy Cornbread. She had these Dry Lips that felt all crumbly. I canít say I got Turned Out.

NOLA	Well Iím glad you didnít so I could get born. Must have Butter on Cornbread. Hey Miss Ella.

ELLA	You lost your Keys again?

NOLA	Sorry for calling so late last night. Got my Spare Set from my Moms.

ELLA	Good Ôcuz Iím not replaciní them for the Third time. And whereís your Rent pray tell? Itís Two and a Half Weeks late.

NOLA	My Student Loan deferment ended so I have less Money every month now.

ELLA	I said Rent, not deferment. Rent. Rent. Iím already cutting you a deal because Septima and Stokely and I go way back.

NOLA	Iím working on it.

ELLA	I could get three times what I charge you. What are your Parentsí Renters paying?

NOLA	I never asked them.

ELLA	Just donít make me have to harangue you. It messes up my Yoga.

NOLA	Iíll Pay you as soon as I get my check from Teaching. Promise.

ELLA	I try to never make promises I canít keep.

(ON SCREEN: Am I in your pocket right now? Saving me for a
rainy day? Iím here.)

MARS	Where is No NO La La? La No? La No? La No?

NOLA	I was painting and I lost track of time. Is Skylar still up?

OPAL	She made you Vegan Cookies. She fell asleep so I put her to bed.

NOLA	I am so sorry. I was late for school today too. I am fully jacking up my Life with the CPT today.

OPAL	Being late is one thing but forgetting People are there is another.

NOLA	I want to try committing to you. Isnít that the only way to learn how to do it?

OPAL	I was your Age when I had Skylar. I was pretty young but I was sure I wanted to be a Mom. And you, youíre not sure of anything. Iím drawn to you because you have this Energy I used to have before she came along. And I donít want you to be anything but yourself. So donít make any promises to me we know you canít keep.

NOLA	I made it into the Second Round for the Catlett Prize.

OPAL	Thatís wonderful. You deserve it.

NOLA	Can you give Skylar this for me? You both inspired me today. I feel like Iím getting closer to what Iíve been trying to do. Youíre making me a better Artist. I want to keep seeing you. Both of you.

OPAL	We can stay in touch as Friends, but I have to think about whether we can be anything more.

NOLA	Will you come to the Group Show?

OPAL	Of course. Oh. Hereís the Painting you left. And your Shoes.

NOLA	Let me give you your Birks.

OPAL	No, they look good on you. I have Three other pairs anyway. Night.

NOLA	Night. Iím learning.
