BROOK	Carson, don't tell that story again.
CARSON	No, don't. Brook, you love it when I tell people how amazing you looked in that bikini.
PARKER	No, no, no, come on. We're not in a frat house, please break it up. 
CARSON	Parks, you're so old. 
BROOK	Ugh, come on, it's their anniversary.
GABRIELLE	No, I'm good.
BROOK	So. Twenty years. How'd you do it?
GABRIELLE	A lot of hard work and commitment.
CARSON	No, really though.
PARKER	Shut up, Carson.
PARKER	That was a great dinner, Brook. 
GABRIELLE	Yeah, thank you.
BROOK	Yeah. No worries. Are you two looking forward to your romantic getaway? 
GABRIELLE	We are, actually.
BROOK	Hmm.
PARKER	Yes, we-we are.
GABRIELLE	Are you sure you're okay having Lexa here?
BROOK	Oh yeah, of course! I need a shopping buddy.
GABRIELLE	You guys have an anniversary coming up, don't you?
BROOK	Ugh, that's nothing compared to yours.
GABRIELLE	Well, they say in a lot of ways the first few years are the hardest. After that then you've got the commitment to make it work. 
PARKER	Downhill.
GABRIELLE	Yep.
CARSON	So you two are going to spend two whole days doing what, exactly?
PARKER	Well, I'm probably going to stay up nights worrying about my clients but other than that--
CARSON	Okay, technically, our clients. 
PARKER	No, no.
CARSON	And it's the weekend.
GABRIELLE	Here we go. Shop talk.
PARKER	No, no, no--
BROOK	I agree. You two spend enough time together at the office. 
PARKER	Uh-uh.
BROOK	Yes!
PARKER	No.
BROOK	This is family time. So, tell us all about your fabulous plans for the weekend.
PARKER	Gabby made all the plans. The only thing I know is kayaking is involved.
CARSON	You're gonna spend two days on the water?
PARKER	Yeah, pretty much. She's gonna show me some awesome standing waves, come on.
BROOK	Right. You were a kayaking champion.
GABRIELLE	That was a long time ago.
PARKER	No. 
CARSON	Didn't you have a nasty accident or something?
GABRIELLE	I did. I still have the life jacket that saved me.
PARKER	Hanging in the garage. 
PARKER	On that note. Um, it's getting late and we have an early morning tomorrow. Would you sto-- No, no, no. 
BROOK	It's late.
GABRIELLE	I'm good.
PARKER	Look who's here.
GABRIELLE	Hey! Lex, are you good?
LEXA	Sure, Mom. I was watching TV. Uncle Carson has a popcorn machine. 
GABRIELLE	Oh, wow then you are set. Lexa loves popcorn. She thinks it's a food group.
GABRIELLE	So you're gonna be my good girl and you can call us anytime. We'll be back late Sunday afternoon, okay?
LEXA	Don't worry about me, I'm fine. Have fun though.
GABRIELLE	Okay, we will. Muah.
BROOK	Yeah, don't worry about us. You just have a great time. 
BROOK	We will, right?
LEXA	Yep. 
BROOK	So, you two be careful on the river.
GABRIELLE	We always are. 
PARKER	How about one more hug? Just one more. Sorry, I'm squeezing.
GABRIELLE	Alright. Night.
GABRIELLE	Bye.
CARSON	Parents are gone for the weekend, let her live a little bit.
BROOK	No I'm good, we're done! Hey, it's late. Really. Come on, don't be silly.
CARSON	You used to be fun.
BROOK	You are horrible!
PARKER	Wow, look at that.
GABRIELLE	I uh, I had the Ranger help me.
PARKER	Does he do windows? This is really nice, Gabby. 
GABRIELLE	Remember the first time that we ever came here?
PARKER	Yeah. I remember.
GABRIELLE	We were so happy.
PARKER	Yeah, you were scared.
GABRIELLE	True.
PARKER	Yeah, well, let's get this show on the road, shall we? Let me show you how a real kayaker does things. 
GABRIELLE	Oh, yeah, right. 
GABRIELLE	Parker.
PARKER	No, no, no we had an agreement. You said this weekend was fine. I told you that this weekend was off limits--
GABRIELLE	Come on! Let's go!
PARKER	Yeah.
GABRIELLE	Parker!
PARKER	No, there is no--
GABRIELLE	Thought you were gonna teach me how it's done?
PARKER	Sorry.
GABRIELLE	You ready?
PARKER	Yeah, yeah, let's do it.
GABRIELLE	Let's go.
GABRIELLE	Lexa would love this. She's old enough now, we can take her out. You know, maybe get her some lessons? Summer break--
PARKER	Yeah that'd be a good idea.
GABRIELLE	Yeah! Summer break's coming, we could go camping. I think she'd enjoy it.
PARKER	Yep.
GABRIELLE	You gonna take a photo?
PARKER	Smile!
GABRIELLE	You remembered the waterproof case, huh?
GABRIELLE	The water was great today. Not too crazy.
PARKER	Mm! Yeah. It was definitely a lot calmer than you described it before, though.
GABRIELLE	We should do this more often. 
PARKER	Hmm.
GABRIELLE	And leave your phone behind.
PARKER	Unfortunately we can't. Clients! They watch the stock market, and must share their concerns right away. 
GABRIELLE	Parker. Are we-Are we okay? 
PARKER	It's just work. I've been busier than usual.
GABRIELLE	I know. I Just even when we're at home, you seem disconnected. 
PARKER	We're fine, Gab--
GABRIELLE	No, we're not. 
PARKER	Gabrielle, what do you want me to do? It's my job.
GABRIELLE	I have a job too but you don't see me on the phone.
PARKER	It's different. Your clients love you. 
GABRIELLE	Well I love you. Hmm?
PARKER	Come on.
GABRIELLE	Maybe I can show you how much.
PARKER	Woo! Gabby! Woo!
GABRIELLE	It's a little tricky around this bend.
PARKER	Are you kidding? This is what I've been hoping for. You go, I'll be right behind you. 
GABRIELLE	Alright but once we start, we're committed.
PARKER	Trust me, I can handle it.
GABRIELLE	Follow close!
PARKER	Hold on a second. Gabby! Smile. Good one. Perfect!
GABRIELLE	Come on!
GABRIELLE	Woo! 
GABRIELLE	Ooh!
GABRIELLE	Parker! Parker! Parker!  Oh, god. Oh my god. Oh no. Parker! Parker! Parker!
OFFICER	Detective, the wife's at the cabin.
ASHER	Mrs. Langston? I'm Detective Blackton. Call me Asher. 
GABRIELLE	Why is this taking so long? Did you find Parker?
ASHER	No. No sign of him yet. Can I ask you a few questions?
GABRIELLE	I can't stand waiting here. If they let me back on the river I could go further downstream--
ASHER	Our search teams know every rock and turn of this river. How long has your husband been kayaking?
GABRIELLE	A few years. He used to do it just for me, but I think he likes it now. 
ASHER	And was he a good swimmer?
GABRIELLE	Yeah, he was a good swimmer. He could be out there on those rocks; freezing.
ASHER	I know it's hard to sit and wait, but we're doing the best we can.
GABRIELLE	Just please find him. Please.
OFFICER	I got something over here.
GABRIELLE	Oh no.
OFFICER	We got something!
GABRIELLE	His life jacket.
LEXA	Mom? Where's dad?
GABRIELLE	There's been an accident.
LEXA	No!
GABRIELLE	I love you so much. It's gonna be okay.
BROOK	I'm sorry.
GABRIELLE	Hi Detective? It's Gabrielle. I was just calling to see if-- If there was any news? Okay. Thank you.
ASHER	Gabrielle. I'm sorry. We couldn't find him. It's been 2 weeks. Search and Rescue has already been out there longer than they normally would. We did everything we could.
GABRIELLE	So that's it? He could still be out there-
ASHER	Gabrielle, if he was, we would have heard from him. Somebody would have seen him. We've actually been on a recovery operation the last week. I thought you knew that.
GABRIELLE	No. I don't believe it. Parker's not dead. Where's his body? 
ASHER	It's Search and Rescue's opinion that his-- his body was pulled under a rock and we may never recover it. The team found this. Still works. I'm sorry. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
GABRIELLE	Detective Blackton.
ASHER	I wanted to pay my respects. I'm very sorry for your loss. 
GABRIELLE	Thank you. 
CARSON	I know what you did. 
GABRIELLE	I'm sorry?
CARSON	Parker didn't even want to go on that trip.
GABRIELLE	That's not true.
CARSON	You forced him into that dinky little boat.
GABRIELLE	No, I didn't.
CARSON	Yes, you did!
NIKKI	Carson!
CARSON	If it wasn't for you, he'd still be alive.  
GABRIELLE	Excuse me.
ASHER	Hi. I'm detective Blackton. And you're the sister-in-law of the deceased?
BROOK	Right. Thank you. You didn't have to do that.h. What was that all about?
BROOK	Oh that? Nothing. He's just-- Carson had a little too much to drink.
ASHER	Hmm.
BROOK	Excuse me.
KAREN	Carson! For goodness sakes.
CARSON	I'm fine! I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine--
BROOK	Can you stop drinking so much? What is your problem? This is your brother's funeral.
CARSON	It's fine. It's a celebration of life.
BROOK	Can you be a little respectful today? Just a little bit--
CARSON	Just go back to your friends. Enough.
BROOK	Don't touch me! You're embarrassing me.
LEXA	Mom? Mom.
GABRIELLE	Mhm.
LEXA	Are you okay?
GABRIELLE	Mhm.
LEXA	Mom, it wasn't your fault.
GABRIELLE	What if it was? It was my idea to go. 
ALEXA	Oh, hey. I didn't hear you get up.
GABRIELLE	I am going back to work today.
LEXA	Are you ready?
GABRIELLE	It's been two months since the funeral. If I spend one more day in my pajamas, I'm gonna kill myself.  I'm sorry-- that came out wrong. If I'm alone with my thoughts any longer-- We'll get through this. Okay? I love you.
ALEXA	Will you drive me to school?
GABRIELLE	Okay, now you're just workin' it.  Alright, maybe just this once. 
LEXA	Yum!
NIKKI	It's so nice to have you back. 
GABRIELLE	Thanks, Nikki. You did a great job. I can't thank you-- Now, just bring me up to speed so I can do something other than cry.
LEXA	Hey, what's up?
BROOK	Hey! I'm looking for your mom.
LEXA	She went back to work today.
BROOK	Oh, okay. How are you doing, Lex? I miss you.
LEXA	Okay. 
BROOK	Yeah?
LEXA	Do you want to come in? 
BROOK	No, that's okay. I've gotta get going but can you give your mom a message for me?

LEXA	Mhm!
GABRIELLE	Wow! I'm impressed.
LEXA	You know the lasagna was in the freezer, Mom. You cooked it.
GABRIELLE	I know, but still-- I appreciate it.
LEXA	How was work?
GABRIELLE	Good! Busy. But good busy. I'd forgotten what it was like to talk to people. 
LEXA	Who's Genna Koch?
GABRIELLE	Where did that come from?
LEXA	Auntie Brook came by. She said to call her.
GABRIELLE	Uh-- Genna is our insurance broker and financial advisor. After the funeral the lawyers wanted to disburse the insurance-- I wasn't able to get to it, but I will. I guess she called Carson. Or Brook.
NIKKI	If you're not ready, I can go. 
NIKKI	Let me help you.
GABRIELLE	Look, it's important for our clients see that we're-- That I'm okay. And besides, it's already arranged. Lexa's going to Parker's mom's and I could really use a bit of a break.
GENNA	I'm early. Sorry.
GABRIELLE	Oh, Genna, come on in.
GENNA	Hi.
GABRIELLE	Thank you for coming by. I'm still catching up.
GENNA	Ah, no problem. Of course you are.
GABRIELLE	So, I don't understand. We already had a generous life insurance policy. Why would Parker take out a new policy without telling me?
GENNA	Oh. You knew nothing about it?
GABRIELLE	No. I know that Carson and Parker's company wasn't doing as well as it once did but maybe he just wanted a back up plan.
GENNA	Well, the two policies were worth five million dollars.
GABRIELLE	Wait. I thought the old policy was mainly for the business.
GENNA	It was. Parker changed it, um-- Three months before the accident. You are the sole beneficiary.
GABRIELLE	Does Carson know?
GENNA	Yes. He came in to talk about the policy. He was very…surprised. Parker was a good man. He just wanted to take care of you and Lexa.
GABRIELLE	I still can't believe he's gone. That's why I…couldn't deal with this. I'm sorry it took me so long.
GENNA	It's okay. Um, it’s just one signature right there right at the bottom. And it might take a week or so for the funds to transfer to your account. 
GABRIELLE	I don't care about the money. I just-- Thank you for your patience with me Genna. 
GENNA	Okay, perfect. Okay. I guess that's it. Take care.
GABRIELLE	Nikki, I'm-I'm fine. 
GABRIELLE	Everything is fine. I'm okay. I'll fill you in when I get back.  I have to go. 
GABRIELLE	Parker? Parker! Parker?
GABRIELLE	No, seriously, I'm fine. Everything went great. The client signed on for another two-year term.  You know I think I'm just more tired than I realized. I might take tomorrow off.  Okay.  Thanks Nikki.
CARSON	Didn't you have a nasty accident or something?
GABRIELLE	I did. I still have the life jacket that saved me. 
PARKER	Hanging in the garage.
GABRIELLE	Detective. Do you have a minute?
ASHER	Yeah. Yeah, of course. Uh, this is my partner, Donna. 
ASHER	Gabrielle.
DONNA	Hi.
ASHER	How are you?
GABRIELLE	I'm coping.
ASHER	Uh, there's-- There's no news--
GABRIELLE	I figured you would have called if there was. But I was wondering about Parker's life jacket.
ASHER	What about it?
GABRIELLE	I'd like to look at it.
ASHER	Really? 
GABRIELLE	The damage on his jacket was severe. 
ASHER	Yes. 
GABRIELLE	Exactly. I've been in accidents before, been dragged under water and I've only ever once ripped a life jacket. And the water was low. When the water's high you're less likely to hit the rocks.
ASHER	What're you getting at?
GABRIELLE	Can I see it?
ASHER	I'm not sure where this is going.
GABRIELLE	Did you have an expert look at it?
ASHER	Not to my knowledge. But it's pretty obvious what happened here. A novice kayaker went into waters he wasn't used to.
GABRIELLE	No-- He was better than you think. 
ASHER	I understand that you've been through a difficult time.
GABRIELLE	No, you don't. 
ASHER	I'm very sorry for your loss. We're confident there wasn't anything suspicious about your husband's death. Maybe you'd like to speak to one of our grief counselors. Let me get a card.
DONNA	What are you looking for?
ASHER	I'm not sure yet.
NIKKI	I thought you were taking the day off? 
GABRIELLE	I was restless. I figured I'd be better off here. 
NIKKI	Sure. You want to get a coffee?
GABRIELLE	Thanks, I'm-- I'm okay. 
NIKKI	You're not okay. What is it?
GABRIELLE	When I was in San Francisco I was walking through the Wharf.
NIKKI	Mhm.
GABRIELLE	Nikki, I thought I saw Parker.
NIKKI	That's impossible you know that, right?
GABRIELLE	I know it's not possible. But I saw a man, and when I called his name, he turned his head and he disappeared into the crowd.  
NIKKI	What reason would he have to do that?
GABRIELLE	I don't know. I just know what I saw.
NIKKI	Mm mm. Or think you saw. Think about it, why would he do that?  
GABRIELLE	Maybe he didn't want to be with us anymore.
NIKKI	Oh honey. Parker loved you guys. You know that. He would never do anything like that. Your life was perfect with Parker. There were no signs of any trouble, were there? 
GABRIELLE	I'm not sure. I have to go.
CARSON	That's it, just walk away. 
CARSON	Just keep walking. You're watching ten good years get smaller in your rear view mirror. Get outta here! Don't trip.
CARSON	Gabrielle. What can I do for you?
GABRIELLE	Is everything okay?
CARSON	What do you want?
GABRIELLE	How's the company doing?
CARSON	That's why you came down here, to ask how the company's doing? You could have just called me.
GABRIELLE	Well, I'm here. So, how's it doing?
CARSON	Not well. I don't know what Parker told you, but we're not as solvent as we once were.
GABRIELLE	Parker was different the last couple of months. He'd be on the phone a lot after work after work and I-- He would go into the study and I'd hear him yell sometimes. Do you have any idea who that might have been?
CARSON	No, I really don't. Gabrielle , I'm really busy--
GABRIELLE	You know that if you needed help any time I would--
CARSON	I don't need any marketing advice. Thanks.
GABRIELLE	That's not what I meant--
CARSON	Parker may have left you his shares and let's not forget the insurance money. But he left me the company to run. I'm still the CEO, and I don't think the board of directors are gonna vote me out any time soon. So if you'd really like to help, you can help by staying away.
GABRIELLE	Very well. I'd like to go through Parker's office and take his personal things.
CARSON	Ah, you can't. I'll have them sent to you this afternoon. Next time, before you come just call. Or better yet, don't come.
GABRIELLE	Parker. Who were you talking to?
GABRIELLE	I'd like to speak with someone about incoming calls to my husband's phone from June. I have the statements, but there's nothing on them.  Yes I have power of attorney. 23rd. Nothing. Thank you.
LEXA	Mom!
GABRIELLE	Are you okay?
LEXA	I didn't realize you were home. 
GABRIELLE	I couldn't focus at work today. How was school?
LEXA	Um…I miss Dad.
GABRIELLE	Come here. Your Dad loved you very much. Don't ever forget that. 
KAREN	I hope some day we can bring Parker home. 
LEXA	Me too. 
GABRIELLE	We'll find him. 
KAREN	He was such a good boy. Not like Carson who was a bit of a bully. Parker was the sweet one. He always looked after me. When he was ten, he started mowing lawns just so he could buy me presents. Every birthday, every Christmas he'd give me a bottle of perfume.  
LEXA	That's so sweet. 
GABRIELLE	Lex, could you run up to my room and grab the other albums?
KAREN	You're going to rub the flowers off that teacup.
GABRIELLE	Do you-Do you think Parker was happy? With his life. With-with me?
KAREN	How can you ask such a thing? He was happy. Of course he was happy. You had the perfect life.
GABRIELLE	I don't know, Karen. 
KAREN	What do you mean?
GABRIELLE	Did he ever say anything to you? Was anything bothering him?
KAREN	No. I know he spent a lot of hours in the office and was stressed with work. I know he was looking forward to your anniversary weekend. He was.
GABRIELLE	Thanks, Duane.
GABRIELLE	Duane? Hello? Hello? Hello? 
GABRIELLE	Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?
GABRIELLE	Who are you? What do you want? The building's closed. 
TRAVIS	The money, honey. 
GABRIELLE	What money? I haven't got any.
TRAVIS	My weekly payment. Where is it?
GABRIELLE	I-- I don't know what you're talking about. 
TRAVIS	Parker owes me a lot of money. I'm guessing he didn't tell you. You know, your daughter, Lexa, she's awfully pretty. It would be terrible if something were to happen to her.
GABRIELLE	You leave Lexa alone.
TRAVIS	Hey, that's up to you. I need 300 thousand by tomorrow. Consider it a final payment.
GABRIELLE	I'll-- I'll get you your money. All of it. I just-- I need a few days.
TRAVIS	I need the money now.
GABRIELLE	I don't have it now. I can get it to you by the end of the week.
TRAVIS	Yeah? What happens in a week?
GABRIELLE	The broker says I'll have Parker's insurance then. Just please don't hurt my daughter.
TRAVIS	It's my account number. You have one week to get me the money. Or you and your pretty little daughter die. You go to the cops, you and your daughter die.
GABRIELLE	No, no!
TRAVIS	It's done. She's already signed the insurance papers. We'll know when she has the money.
GABRIELLE	Thank you.
GABRIELLE	Where's my daughter? I need to get to her.
ASHER	Take it easy. You've had a big fall. We've already called her. She's with your mother-in-law. What happened?
GABRIELLE	Nothing. I must have fallen.
ASHER	Well the janitor said he saw someone running out of the building in a hurry before he found you. Do you remember anything?
GABRIELLE	No. I'm sorry. It must have been a mugging.
ASHER	Hm. I see your purse is still here. Doesn't seem like anything's missing; that's odd.
GABRIELLE	Look, I'm sorry. I just-- I don't remember anything. I need to get home to my daughter.
ASHER	No, you can't drive. I'll have someone take you home.
DONNA	What's up?
ASHER	Something is really starting to bug me about this kayaking thing.
DONNA	Like what? 
ASHER	I don't know. First the wife wants to look closer at something that clearly is an accident. And now, she's lying about this thing that happened earlier tonight.
DONNA	Any way it could be self-inflicted?
ASHER	Yeah but why would she do that if she's pretending nothing happened?
DONNA	Maybe she really doesn't remember.
ASHER	No. I think she remembers.
BROOK	How are you feeling?
GABRIELLE	I'm okay. Just a little shaken up mostly.
BROOK	Yeah.
LEXA	The cops will get the guy, won't they, Mom?
GABRIELLE	I hope so honey.
LEXA	So if he didn't take your purse, what did he want?
GABRIELLE	I have no idea. Don’t you have homework?
LEXA	No.
GABRIELLE	Nice try.
BROOK	You should really lie down.
GABRIELLE	I'm feeling a little bit better. Brook, did Carson tell you that I went by the office?
BROOK	He mentioned it. He said you wanted to pick up Parker's things.
GABRIELLE	I was looking for something. He seemed overly stressed.
BROOK	He's been like that for a while. His drinking has become a problem.
GABRIELLE	Brooklyn, um-- I know that Parker changed his insurance policy. I think that might be why Carson's mad at me.
BROOK	Really? He doesn't tell me anything. 
GABRIELLE	Yeah, I saw Genna. She told me.  Maybe I should talk to Carson.
BROOK	No, you're best to leave Carson alone. He's got a temper.
GABRIELLE	Do you want to talk about it? 
BROOK	No, that's okay.
GABRIELLE	Are you sure?
BROOK	Yeah. So anyways, what were you looking for? 
BROOK	In what?
BROOK	Parker's stuff. You said you were looking for Parker's stuff.
GABRIELLE	Oh it was nothing. Nothing at all.
GABRIELLE	T. T. T. T. Travis. 20 thousand dollars?  
CARSON	Travis? I don't know any--
CARSON	Travis. What's this all about?
GABRIELLE	I don't know. I found it in one of Parker's calendars; he had a standing appointment with Travis up until a month before he died.
CARSON	Brook? Where are those drinks?
BROOK	I hope Lexa will come and stay with us again. I miss her. She's such a good kid. 
GABRIELLE	She's spending a lot of time at Grandma's. 
BROOK	Ugh, poor Karen. This has hit her hard. Well, all of us of course.
BROOK	You tell Lexa to come over next weekend. There is a wicked sale at the mall.
CARSON	Maybe we're getting a little carried away with the shopping.
BROOK	C'mon, Baby. Don't be such a killjoy. 
GABRIELLE	I should go pick up Lexa.
CARSON	That's a good idea.
GABRIELLE	Do you have a problem with me, Carson? You've been unkind to me since Parker's death. What you said at the funeral
BROOK	Now let's just all try and get along.
GABRIELLE	No, I want to know what his problem is with me.
CARSON	You're my problem. Now if you'll excuse me. There's a bottle of 2007 Margaux with my name on it. I'll be in the cellar.
GABRIELLE	I hope you choke on it.
BROOK	Please don't set him off. 
GABRIELLE	Is he hurting you?
BROOK	He's just had a lot to drink and I really don't want to get into it so-- You know, just don't confront him. I can handle it. I just-- I think it'd be best if you left.
GABRIELLE	Okay. Are you sure?
BROOK	Yeah.
GABRIELLE	Please just call me if you feel unsafe.
BROOK	Okay.
GABRIELLE	'Kay.
GENNA	So, uh the funds were transferred-- 
GENNA	--this morning. Just two final signatures. There's the transfer amount and today's date. Perfect.
GABRIELLE	Thank god! I just-- I need to pay something.
GENNA	Well, I better go.
GABRIELLE	Yeah, thank you for everything.
GENNA	You're welcome.
GABRIELLE	Genna!
GENNA	What's the matter?
GABRIELLE	Genna, the money's gone.
GENNA	What do you mean?
GABRIELLE	The insurance money. All of it. 
GENNA	We need to call the police, you've been hacked.
GABRIELLE	No! No, no, no, just--We need to handle this discretely.
GENNA	Gabrielle, are you in trouble?
GABRIELLE	I don't know, just please don't call the police yet.
GENNA	Okay. 
GABRIELLE	Promise me! 
GENNA	Okay.
GABRIELLE	And one more thing. I need a line of credit.
GENNA	Was your business account cleaned out too?
GABRIELLE	No. I just-- I need more than what's in there.
GENNA	How much more?
GABRIELLE	200 thousand. And I need it today. I need to pay someone.
GENNA	Okay.
GABRIELLE	Thank you.
NIKKI	So all your money is in the Cayman Islands?
GABRIELLE	That's what Genna said.
NIKKI	I don't understand. You were hacked, but they used your passwords.
GABRIELLE	It had to have been Parker.
NIKKI	Parker? What are you talking about?
GABRIELLE	It wasn't a hacker. It was Parker. 
GABRIELLE	He was the only one who knew my passwords; the answers to security questions.
NIKKI	But how is that possible?
GABRIELLE	They never found his body.
NIKKI	So you're saying that he staged his death and then took your insurance money? Not the Parker I 
knew.
GABRIELLE	Well maybe we didn't know Parker at all. I went through his calendars. After our anniversary date, it's blank. There's not a single entry, it's like he knew that he wasn't gonna be here.
NIKKI	So what’ll you do? How will you get your money back? 
GABRIELLE	I don't care about the money. I just-- can't believe that he would do something like this. 
NIKKI	Maybe there is another explanation.
GABRIELLE	Mm. Like what? I went through his phone bills too.
NIKKI	What?
GABRIELLE	I went through Parker's phone bills.
NIKKI	What'd you find? 
GABRIELLE	Well it's what I didn't find. Calls I knew Parker received, right in front of me while we were kayaking.
NIKKI	What about 'em?
GABRIELLE	They're not on the bill. 
NIKKI	So…
GABRIELLE	So he had to have had two phones. 
NIKKI	Have you told the police?
GABRIELLE	No. What are they going to do? Investigate calls Parker never made? A blank calendar? They already think I'm crazy.
NIKKI	Now what?
GABRIELLE	He didn't do this alone.
CARSON	It's the middle of the night, what do you want?
GABRIELLE	I'm coming in.

CARSON	Whoa, whoa, wait a second!
GABRIELLE	Where is he? Where's Parker?
CARSON	Gabrielle, what the hell is this all about?
GABRIELLE	Parker is alive, I saw him. You know where he is, don't you. You guys are in this together.
CARSON	In what? You're crazy, barging in here in the middle of the night.
GABRIELLE	Parker couldn't have pull this off on his own. He needed an accomplice. And it was you!
CARSON	I'm calling the police.
GABRIELLE	Go ahead. And while you're at it, explain to them what you did with the money you stole from my account.
BROOK	Put the-- Put the phone down Carson.
CARSON	Then tell her to see a shrink.
BROOK	You have been under a lot of stress, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE	No. Someone tried to kill me. They asked me about Parker's money.
CARSON	What money? You said that was a mugger.
BROOK	Shh, just let her talk.
GABRIELLE	Why would you and Parker do this to me?
CARSON	Parker's dead. And for all I know, you killed him for the insurance money.
GABRIELLE	The insurance money you stole! 
BROOK	What?
CARSON	What?
GABRIELLE	Oh Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. The money's gone. All of it. 
CARSON	I had nothing to do with that.
GABRIELLE	Genna told me that you came to her looking for an insurance payout.
GABRIELLE	Did you kill Parker for his insurance?
CARSON	You need help! You're crazy.
CARSON	You get her professional help or I'm calling the police.
GABRIELLE	Have another drink.
BROOK	Why don’t-- Why don't you go back to bed.  Hmm? And I'll handle this.
BROOK	Where is it that you think you saw Parker?
GABRIELLE	San Francisco.
BROOK	Did you speak with him?
GABRIELLE	No, it was-- It was in a crowd. I lost him. But it was him.
BROOK	So there is a possibility that you saw someone that looks like him and your brain wanted it to be 
Parker.
GABRIELLE	Brook, I'm not crazy. I know what I saw. Okay? I think that Carson is somehow involved and he got access to my account numbers and stole the insurance money.
BROOK	Okay. We'll look into it in the morning. 
GABRIELLE	There's one other thing. Parker had another phone.. I think they've been planning this for a long time.
BROOK	Sweetie, I'm sorry.
RADIO	Bay area weather. September is here with cooler temperatures and some fog in the morning. We'll have a high of 65 and a low of--
PARKER	I've been waiting for your call. Yeah. Alright.
RADIO	ferry terminal. And at the studios it's a balmy 65 degrees. 101 across the--
BROOK	I didn't know where else to go.
GABRIELLE	Come in. Come in. Sit.
GABRIELLE	Oh my-- Did he do that to you?
BROOK	Uh, after you left Carson got into a fight with me and he was just so angry, I-- I couldn't take it anymore. I-- He's become so violent. I didn't know what to do.
GABRIELLE	You did the right thing. 
BROOK	I didn't even like pack a bag or anything. 
GABRIELLE	You're safe now, okay?
BROOK	Thank you for being my friend, Gabby. I know that we haven't always been close, but I didn't know where else to go.
GABRIELLE	It's okay, I'm here for you. I think we should call the police--
BROOK	What? No. No, I just want out. Quietly. No police. 
GABRIELLE	Okay, we'll find you a lawyer then.
BROOK	I feel so stupid like I-- I didn't even have time to pack a toothbrush or anything!
GABRIELLE	Well Lexa's still at Karen's. I have a client, but I could swing by your house later, pick up some things for you if you like?
BROOK	With Lexa? I don't want her to know.
GABRIELLE	She won't be with me. And I won't tell her.
BROOK	I just-- I don't think it's safe.
GABRIELLE	I'm not afraid of Carson.
BROOK	Okay, I'll write you a list. It’s Carson's poker night tonight so if you go after 7, it should be safe. 
GABRIELLE	Okay.
BROOK	Thank you.
GABRIELLE	It's gonna be okay.
GABRIELLE	Somebody home? Hello? Carson? 
GABRIELLE	Carson? Carson! Carson!  Carso-- Carson. Carson. Come on, wake up. Oh my god. Carson? Carson!? Carson! Hang on, Carson. Hang on.
GABRIELLE	Help! Help! I-I need an ambulance. A man has been stabbed. Please, help me!
GABRIELLE	I’m fine.
ASHER	When you guys leave make sure to call the office.
ASHER	Gabrielle, you all right? I can call another ambulance. 
GABRIELLE	No, just please call Brooklyn, she's at my house. And I'd like to wash my hands.
ASHER	Yes, yes I asked to process the evidence and it’ll only take a minute then we’ll get you a ride home.
DONNA	Detective? 
ASHER	We done here?
ASHER	Gabrielle. Carson was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital. Gabrielle, can you step away from the car.
GABRIELLE	What's going on? What are you doing?
ASHER	You're under arrest for murder. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law --
GABRIELLE	No, I didn't kill him. Ask Brooklyn. She asked me to pick up some things for her at the house. When I got here he was already hurt, okay. You gotta believe me, I didn’t hurt anyone. Please! Just call Brook. Did you call her?
ASHER	Yeah, we did. She said last night you showed up on her doorstep at 3 o’clock in the morning, and you physically assaulted Carson as you walked inside the house.
GABRIELLE	No, I-- 
ASHER	And once inside, you proceeded to have an altercation with him. Watch your head. 
GABRIELLE	That is not what happened! That’s a lie!
ASHER	Gabrielle. Did you go over to the house last night?
GABRIELLE	Yes.
ASHER	And did he threaten to call the police?
GABRIELLE	Yes, but that’s not what--   
DONNA	What do you think?
ASHER	Crime of passion?
DONNA	It's more calculated than that. We should look into her husband's accident.
GABRIELLE	I want my lawyer. 
ASHER	Lawyer's on his way. This could go a lot more smoothly for you if you just cooperate with us. 
GABRIELLE	I know how this works. You badger me until I tell you exactly what you wanna hear and-- I’m not that stupid! 
ASHER	I never said you were. You know, I could believe that this was an accident, or at least self-defense. Carson hurt his wife, like you said, then he comes after you with a knife. You struggle then you somehow get the knife back from someone twice your size and accidentally stab him. 
GABRIELLE	I will only speak with my lawyer.
ASHER	Yeah, of course. You don't have to say anything. I'll just talk. You see, Carson's death comes on the heels of Parker's mysterious death--
GABRIELLE	Mysterious?
ASHER	Like you said the life jacket could not have torn like that in high water.
GABRIELLE	Last week I couldn't even convince you to look at it. What’s that?
ASHER	The team searched the river again. It was stuck under a rock.
GABRIELLE	It's not mine.
ASHER	What's in the Cayman's?
GABRIELLE	What?
ASHER	Two airline tickets purchased this morning. One for you and one for Lexa. One way tickets to the Cayman Islands.
GABRIELLE	I didn't buy it.
ASHER	They used your credit card. You killed Parker for the money. Brooklyn and Carson got suspicious. Carson threatened to call the police. So you killed Carson, is Brooklyn next?
GABRIELLE	You’ve gotta be kidding me!?
ASHER	Do I look like I'm kidding? I heard what he said at the funeral. He was onto you. And I talked to Genna Koch. Who said that he didn't want the theft of your insurance money investigated. Gabrielle, with these two deaths it’s gonna be better for you in the long run if you confess.
GABRIELLE	I didn’t kill Carson and I didn’t kill Parker. Why would I come to you about the damage to the life jacket? Someone is trying to set me up. W-Where was Brook when Carson was killed?
ASHER	I will answer that if you tell me what happened to Parker.
GABRIELLE	I didn't kill my husband!
ASHER	I think we’re done here!
GABRIELLE	He's not dead. 
ASHER	What?
GABRIELLE	I saw him. I think he faked his death for the insurance money. 
ASHER	Where did you see him?

GABRIELLE	San Francisco.
ASHER	When?
GABRIELLE	Your turn.
ASHER	Brooklyn ordered take-out from your house. The delivery boy confirmed that she was there about the same time as the murder. Can you think of anyone else to point to? 
GABRIELLE	I don’t know.
ASHER	What? What are you about to say?
GABRIELLE	Nothing.
ASHER	Gabrielle, I don't know who you're trying to protect but at this point, you are our prime suspect. You are our only suspect. You can be charged with murder one and if  find that you’re connected to your husband's death, two counts. You’ll post bond in the morning, don’t leave town. And if you're guilty, Gabrielle, I'll prove it. 
GABRIELLE	And if I'm innocent?
DONNA	I almost want to believe her. Almost. She’s good.
ASHER	Or she's telling the truth. 
ASHER	Hey Gibbsey, you still working in the fabric lab? I'm gonna send you a life jacket, put a rush on it, will you?
GABRIELLE	Karen, I am so sorry for your loss.
KAREN	I don't ever want to see you again.
GABRIELLE	What? Wh-h-- This is all a big mistake. I didn't hurt anyone. 
KAREN	Then why did the police arrest you?
GABRIELLE	Where’s Lexa? 
LEXA	Mom!?
GABRIELLE	Lexa, honey, you need to come home. 
KAREN	I’ve called child protective services. She's not going anywhere.
GABRIELLE	Brooklyn? 
ASHER	Look, I don't think you should be here.
BROOK	Why are you here?
GABRIELLE	Brooklyn, can we talk? Look, w-when I got here, I-I don’t know what happened. Carson was already unconscious and bleeding.
BROOK	How could you? Maybe Carson was right, he never really trusted you. Why did you have such a big insurance policy for Parker?
GABRIELLE	You know that I-I knew nothing about the extra insurance. All that money is gone, I thought that Carson took it.
BROOK	Yeah. You told me. You made me believe your lies. I thought I could trust you. I thought you wanted to help me, not kill my husband.
GABRIELLE	I would never kill-
BROOK	And with Carson gone now, you own the company. You've done quite well for yourself, Gabrielle. Don't come near me again, or I'll get a restraining order.
GABRIELLE	This is-This is like a bad dream. It’s like a nightmare. I keep expecting to wake up. And what is happening?
ASHER	Brooklyn says she's afraid of you. Does she have any reason to be afraid of you, Gabrielle?
GABRIELLE	This stinks of a set up. What does your cop nose say?
ASHER	That you're not telling me everything. 
GABRIELLE	The man in the stairwell that night. He wasn't there to mug me. He said Parker had his money and he wanted it back. I didn't tell you the truth because he threatened to kill me and Lexa. I didn’t know what it all meant. It’s why I told Genna not to call the police. 
ASHER	Could identify him?
GABRIELLE	Maybe. I think his name was Travis. I found evidence in Parker's files that he was making payments to him every week. Over two years, it totaled two million dollars. I think Travis is behind all of this.
ASHER	But if Parker's paying Travis, then why would Travis kill Carson.
GABRIELLE	Because about a month before, before Parker disappeared the payments stopped and I need to look at Parker's work computers. 
ASHER	Why?
GABRIELLE	I don't know just to follow the money and prove that I'm innocent.
ASHER	No, I can’t let you near those computers until you're cleared. You gotta stay away from rooklyn, her house and Langston Financial. 
GABRIELLE	Do you believe anything I just told you?
ASHER	I don't know. 
GABRIELLE	Real estate holdings.
DONNA	I called building security.
ASHER	Portland P.D. Thanks.
GABRIELLE	San Francisco? 
ASHER	Thanks.
ASHER	Real estate holdings.
DONNA	San Francisco? 
ASHER	Gabrielle's trying to find Parker.
DONNA	Dead Parker, you think he’s still alive?
ASHER	It’s Gibbsey? 
ASHER	What do you got for me? Okay, leave it there, we're on our way.
ASHER	What does Gibbsey say?
DONNA	He agrees that the damage 
DONNA	--was deliberately caused. The top of the tear seems precise, probably caused by a sharp knife, consistent with a box cutter, but the rest of the tear is ripped.  He also notes that the person was right handed and had to have worn the jacket at the time. He figures it was a male as ripping the fabric takes considerable strength.
ASHER	So, Parker did fake his death.
DONNA	And wanted to make it look like an accident. Plus, if she wanted to kill her husband for his insurance money,  she would have claimed it as fast as she could. She didn't, she waited 2 months.
ASHER	That’s the only thing he didn't count on.
DONNA	But then why is Parker is San Francisco, wouldn't he wanna be far away?
ASHER	Unless he’s waiting for something. Or someone. Do me a favour, run a background check. Real estate holdings in San Francisco.
DONNA	Where are you going?
ASHER	To confirm something.
ASHER	Brooklyn? 
ASHER	Brooklyn?
ASHER	Asher. Yeah, she's gone. I gotta find Gabrielle before she finds Parker. Can you put a trace on both Brooklyn and Gabrielle’s phones, and uhh, send me those four addresses from San Francisco. Thank you, I’m on my way.
GABRIELLE	Lexa, honey, I know this is hard to understand. This is all a big mistake, okay, I love you.
ASHER	Call our San Francisco liaison. Tell them I’m on my way.
GABRIELLE	Karen, please call me, we need to talk.
GABRIELLE	Parker!? What have you done? Answer me. You at least owe me that much.
PARKER	You shouldn't be here.
GABRIELLE	You shouldn't be here? You faked your own death. What did you think that would do to me? To Lexa? I mean, your daughter is heartbroken. 
PARKER	You don't understand.
GABRIELLE	No, I don’t understand! Of course I don't understand.
PARKER	You need to leave. Come on just-- 
GABRIELLE	I am not going anywhere until you tell me what is going on. This is about the money, isn't it?
PARKER	What did you do!?
PARKER	Gabby! Gabby!
BROOK	You're welcome. I’ll get some tape.
ASHER	Hey, has Gabrielle's turned her phone on yet? 
DONNA	Not yet.
ASHER	Brooklyn?
DONNA	Hers went dark last night.
ASHER	All right, let me know if you know anything.
BROOK	You still don't trust me?
PARKER	Of course I trust you, I love you.
BROOK	No you don't. You won't even give me the account password.
PARKER	Look, I just need to be sure, okay? Don't you trust me? She wasn't supposed to find me.
BROOK	It's not a big deal, we just have to get rid of one more person. 
PARKER	No, we're not killing her. There wasn't supposed to be any killing. 
BROOK	Carson was getting suspicious.  After her little scene, it was only a matter of time before he figured it all out.
PARKER	You could’ve just left. We would be in the Cayman's by now.
BROOK	It's too late for that. If Gabrielle claimed the insurance when she was supposed to--
PARKER	Look, I don't care about the money, I care about you. Carson was my brother, he didn't deserve to die, Brook. Jesus, what are we doing?
BROOK	Don't get all principled with me.
PARKER	Look, you're all I've been thinking about. I have our passports. Let's just you and I take the money and go. We'll start over, get new jobs.
BROOK	A job, no. I don’t want to start over. I want what I’ve been working so hard for. Come on, baby. I need a certain lifestyle. You want me to be happy, don’t you? Keep your eye on the prize, I’m worth it.
PARKER	I can’t kill her.
BROOK	That’s obvious.
PARKER	No, Lexa needs her mother!
BROOK	She’s seen us Parker and besides if you really cared for Lexa you wouldn’t even be here.
PARKER	I mean it Brook.
BROOK	Sleeping Beauty awakes.
PARKER	Get her some water.
GABRIELLE	Tell me. How long has that been going on? 
GABRIELLE	Please tell you did this for a better reason than to be with a younger woman. You didn’t fake your death and left Lexa for Brook.  
PARKER	You don't know how hard it was to leave Lexa.
GABRIELLE	Oh, don't even try. I don't even know you.
PARKER	20 years is a long time to be with one person.
GABRIELLE	So you did this because you were bored?
PARKER	Everyone deserves to be happy. We all get one life, with Brook I feel young.
GABRIELLE	You're actually trying to justify what you did? What about Carson, how are you gonna rationalize that one? My god, Parker. Do you even hear yourself? Why not just leave me? I mean, why the charade?
PARKER	Because I was broke and in debt and because the only way I could start over was with the money.
GABRIELLE	You mean the only way she would go with you was with money. I guess I should just be happy that you didn't kill me, too.
BROOK	I suggested it, Gabs. 
GABRIELLE	I see your bruise is gone.
TRAVIS	Oh, did I just interrupt a family reunion?
TRAVIS	Parker? It’s good to see you again, you’re looking well for a dead man.
PARKER	What do you want?
TRAVIS	What, no small talk? No chit-chat? Parker, I'm hurt. I believe you have a bank account with 5 million dollars in it.
PARKER	Tell your boss I can make the payments again. Tell me where to wire the money.
TRAVIS	Oh no, this has nothing to do with my boss. See, I've started my own enterprise. But hey, enough about me, I’m gonna need that number from you, Parker.
BROOK	Just give him the number Parker, before he kills us!
TRAVIS	No? 
PARKER	No just--
TRAVIS	 Not her, okay well, how about your wife then? The mother of your child.
PARKER	Wait. Please, please, please.
GABRIELLE	You were in bed with the mob?
PARKER	I needed the money, Gabby and banks don't loan like they used to.
GABRIELLE	So you borrowed from the mob?
PARKER	This is why I had to leave, they were gonna kill me. I needed them to think that I was dead.
PARKER	All right, just stop. It’s okay, it’s all right, just--You got it, okay, you have it, just—
TRAVIS	We got it.
PARKER	Brook.
TRAVIS	Check the balance.
PARKER	You killed my brother.
GABRIELLE	And you attacked me.
BROOK	We had to make sure you got the insurance money.
TRAVIS	Sorry about the stairs.
GABRIELLE	Why not kill me?
BROOK	We got it!
TRAVIS	You have me to thank for that. I thought you might be a good investment just in case. Brook, here couldn’t get the account number.
BROOK	Well, not to worry, we will fix that.
PARKER	After all I gave up for you.
BROOK	Gave up for me? Please. You wanted me from the moment you saw me. You told me all about how you wanted to start a new life with me.
PARKER	What about him?
BROOK	Let's just say I've known Travis longer than I've known Carson.
PARKER	All right look, just let Gabrielle go, please.
TRAVIS	You’re not making the rules here, Parker.
PARKER	I know, Travis, I’m gonna do whatever you ask me to do, just please.
TRAVIS	And I really don’t need your help.
BROOK	Look out!
BROOK	Oh baby, thank you, he was threatening to kill me. I didn’t know what to do!
PARKER	Shut up!  Shut up!
GABRIELLE	Put the gun down, Parker.
BROOK	Nothing has changed.
GABRIELLE	Put the gun down. Call the poli--
PARKER	I can’t call the police!
BROOK	Everything’s the same, we can still go!
ASHER	This is Detective Blackton of Portland PD, I’m gonna need assistance.
PARKER	Just shut up, just shut up!
GABRIELLE	Call the police!
PARKER	What do you think they’re gonna do to me?
GABRIELLE	They’re gonna--  
PARKER	I can’t just--  
GABRIELLE	Call the police.
PARKER	Please, stop talking to me, you’re yelling at me!
BROOK	I have waited so long to do this.
GABRIELLE	I trusted you with my daughter.
ASHER	It's over. Drop your gun, Gabrielle. Don't do it. Please.
GABRIELLE	You're right. She's not worth it.
ASHER	It's all over now. Paramedics are on their way.
GABRIELLE	Lexa?
ASHER	She's fine, she’s with her Grandmother.
LEXA	Mom!
GABRIELLE	I’m okay now.
KAREN	Let’s all go inside, come on, come on.
GABRIELLE	You ready? 
LEXA	Yeah!
GABRIELLE	It was my first river too.
LEXA	I know, I'm excited.
ASHER	Hey! 
GABRIELLE	Hey!
ASHER	I heard you were back at work. 
GABRIELLE	It keeps my mind focused. 
ASHER	How are you doing, Lexa?
LEXA	Okay.
ASHER	Well, I see you venture back on the water.
GABRIELLE	It’s her first time.
ASHER	Oh.
LEXA	We're going to The Point where Mom started.
GABRIELLE	Uhh Lexa, can you grab the life jackets out of the garage?
ASHER	How is she, really?
GABRIELLE	I don't know what's worse. Having your father actually die or finding out he faked his death.
ASHER	Those files that you gave us helped us bring down the mobsters that Parker was connected to.
GABRIELLE	What's gonna happen to him?
ASHER	Well, he’s gonna do some time.
GABRIELLE	What about Brooklyn?
ASHER	She's in much bigger trouble, she's gonna be locked away for awhile.
GABRIELLE	Thank you for believing in me, not giving up on me.
ASHER	Innocent until proven guilty. 
ASHER	The Point? Is that where the beginners go?
GABRIELLE	It's a good spot. Why, you thinking of learning?
ASHER	You know someone who could teach me?
GABRIELLE	I might.
GABRIELLE	You’re doing great! 
LEXA	This is fun! Maybe The Grand Canyon next?
GABRIELLE	Maybe next year.
