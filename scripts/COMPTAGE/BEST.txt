LUCY	in the guidance office.

LUCY	You got a special in with the guidance counselor

LUCY	or something?

EVELYN	Mom...

EVELYN	Besides, I already know where I'm applying.

LUCY	Really? What's the lucky school?

LUCY	Harvard, Princeton, Oxford?

EVELYN	Uh, CalArts.

LUCY 	CalArts.

EVELYN	Yeah, is something wrong

EVELYN	with that?

LUCY	Nothing's wrong with CalArts.

LUCY	I didn't say that, I just think you should try

LUCY	for the best school you can.

LUCY	And with your grades and achievements,

LUCY	that could be almost anywhere.

EVELYN	I wanna be with Breanna in LA.

LUCY	Sweetie, I know it's been hard for you, making friends, 

LUCY	and I am so glad you met someone

LUCY	you get along with so well like Breanna, but...

EVELYN	You don't understand.

LUCY	I'll see you later!

TEACHER	So yesterday, we talked about

TEACHER	the two authors that I have listed here.

TEACHER	Would it be surprising to learn that both of these authors

TEACHER	They're the exact same person.

TEACHER	Why would an author do something like this? Yes?

BRIANNA	Hello.

TEACHER	Evelyn, you're needed in the front office.

TEACHER	Okay, okay.

TEACHER	But but yes, they are the exact same...

MS. WALSH	Breanna McMillen!

BRIANNA	Hello, Ms. Walsh.

MRS. WALSH	Why aren't you in class?

BRIANNA	Uh, I was actually just about to go,

BRIANNA	but I really have to

EVELYN	She's helping me!

EVELYN	College week, my mom needed help

EVELYN	posting more flyers,

EVELYN	and Breanna was nice enough to volunteer.

MRS. WALSH	Well, keep it quiet.

MRS WALSH	Class is in session.

EVELYN	Yeah, sorry, Ms. Walsh.

BRIANNA	Sorry.

MRS WALSH	And drop a few by my class.

MRS WALSH 	I'm all out.

EVELYN	Yeah, yeah, of course Come on!

EVEVLYN	What what's this?

BRIANNA	A bike.

EVELYN	If my mom finds out about...

BRIANNA	...you lying about putting up flyers, you mean?

BRIANNA	Let's go.

EVELYN	Let's go!

MUSIQUE	Growing up and chasing stars ?

MUSIQUE	Anything is possible ?

MUSIQUE	The world seems bright and beautiful ?

MUSIQUE	And everything is ours, you know ?

MUSIQUE	Weightless ? 

MUSIQUE	I'm floating weightless ?

MUSIQUE	Take me on this roller coaster ride ?

MUSIQUE	Weightless ?

EVELYN	Where are you going?

EVELYN	Bree, we can't!

BRIANNA	Come on!

BRIANNA	You can write about it in your diary.

EVELYN	It's not a diary,

EVELYN	it's a memoir.

BRIANNA	Let's go!

BRIANNA	So what's your memoir about?

EVELYN	It's about you and me and the things we love.

EVELYN	Red roses and lipstick, movies, Hollywood.

BRIANNA	Norma Jean?

EVELYN	Of course!

BRIANNA	There you go.

BRIANNA	It's cool, right?

BRIANNA	What's wrong?

EVELYN	I don't like heights.

BRIANNA	Okay, that settles it, you're jumping.

EVELYN	Um, no.

BRIANNA	Fear is an ugly emotion.

EVELYN	I'm not jumping.

BRIANNA	We can do it together,

BRIANNA	take my hand.

EVELYN	No, I'm not jumping!

BRIANNA	All right.

EVELYN	What are you doing?

BRIANNA	Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius,

BRIANNA	and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous

BRIANNA	than absolutely boring.

EVELYN	Breanna!

EVELYN	Bree? Breanna!

EVELYN	Breanna!

EVELYN	Bree?

EVELYN	Bree...oh my God.

EVELYN	Bree!

EVELYN	Bree.

EVELYN	Bree, Bree!

EVELYN	Oh my God, Bree!

EVELYN	Bree, Bree...

EVELYN	Bree?

BRIANNA	You shoulda seen your face!

EVELYN	I thought you were dead!

BRIANNA	I was kidding!

EVELYN	Why did you do that?

BRIANNA	I I guess I just wanted to see how far you'd go for me.

BRIANNA	To see if you're really my best friend.

BRIANNA	I'm sorry I scared you, okay?

BRIANNA	I got you something.

BRIANNA	Here, you get the black.

BRIANNA	Help me put it on? Look at the back.

EVELYN	Mm-hm. Let's never go back.

EVELYN	Bree...

BRIANNA	I'm serious.

BRIANNA	We should go to LA now, today.

BRIANNA	We don't have to wait.

EVELYN	What are you talking about?

BRIANNA	Do you ever...

BRIANNA	close your eyes and...

BRIANNA	wish that everything were different?

MINDY	Hey.

MINDY	I thought I could help get you started on your packing.

MINDY	Look, I know it's hard moving to a new city

MINDY	for everybody.

BRIANNA	Yeah. Thanks.

BRIANNA	I remember from just two years ago.

MINDY	But you got through it.

MINDY	And you're doing better than ever.

MINDY	Your grades are up and you're making new friends.

BRIANNA	What's the point of making friends

BRIANNA	when you'll just make us move again?

MINDY	This is a really great opportunity for us.

BRIANNA	No.

BRIANNA	This is a really great opportunity for you.

GREG	I thought we were gonna try to work things out.

MINDY	This isn't up for debate, Greg.

MINDY	North Carolina Park Services are offering me

MINDY	 percent over what I make now

MINDY	and I'll be a supervisor.

GREG	And how about moving three states away?

GREG	How's your daughter gonna feel about that?

MINDY	You do not get to act like you care about Breanna,

MINDY	not after what you did. I never did anything!

GREG	I told you!

MINDY	GREG	Whatever Breanna told you She wasn't the one who told me.

MINDY	She even tried to cover for you.

MINDY	Don't you think I know my own daughter

MINDY	better than that?

GREG	I think Breanna is very good

GREG	At convincing people to think and do what she wants,

GREG	and if she got someone to lie for her 

MINDY	I said this wasn't up for debate.

MINDY	It is over, Greg.

GREG	But Goodbye.

MINDY	What are you doing?

LUCY	I bought unbleached cake flour

LUCY	Thought we could make those scones we saw

LUCY	on Battle of the Bakers.

EVELYN	Okay, great.

LUCY	That's pretty.

EVELYN	Oh, thanks.

EVELYN	Bree gave it to me.

EVELYN	Breanna?

LUCY	Breanna, what's wrong? Tell me what happened.

BRIANNA	It's my momshe's she's dead!

LUCY	Stay here, Evelyn.

LUCY	Here you go, Breanna.

BRIANNA	Thank you.

LUCY	This is Detective Kent.

DETECTIVE KENT	Okay, Breanna.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'm gonna need you to go over your story with me

DETECTIVE KENT	just one more time, okay?

BRIANNA	Okay.

BRIANNA	Um...

BRIANNA	I got up about the usual time

BRIANNA	and got ready for school,

BRIANNA	and I went into the kitchen for breakfast,

BRIANNA	and my mom wasn't there.

DETECTIVE KENT	And at this time,

DETECTIVE KENT	had you seen anything unusual?

BRIANNA	No, just that it was quiet.

BRIANNA	Mom always has the coffee going

BRIANNA	before I come down, but...

BRIANNA	this morning, there wasn't any,

BRIANNA	because...

DETECTIVE KENT	I understand.

DETECTIVE KENT	Then what happened?

BRIANNA	I thought she overslept or something, so...

BRIANNA	I went into her room,and that's when I found her.

BRIANNA	I saw her on the floor

BRIANNA	and I thought I could help her, but...

BRIANNA	as soon as I touched her, I knew.

DETECTIVE KENT	I know this isn't easy to hear,

DETECTIVE KENT	but we know your mom was killed with tranquilizer darts,

DETECTIVE KENT	and apparently, they were taken from her own work bag.

DETECTIVE KENT	Were you home last night all night?

BRIANNA	Yes.

DETECTIVE KENT	And when was the last time you actually saw your mom?

BRIANNA	Um...about :?

DETECTIVE KENT	Did you hear anything

DETECTIVE KENT	after you saw your momat :?

BRIANNA	No.

BRIANNA	I had my headphones on and my music was up, I 

BRIANNA	I didn't hear anything

DETECTIVE KENT	Okay.

DETECTIVE KENT	Can you think of anyone, anyone at all,

DETECTIVE KENT	that would want to hurt your mom?

BRIANNA	Um...no.

BRIANNA	Well...there's Greg, Greg Olson.

BRIANNA	That's Mom's boyfriend or ex-boyfriend.

BRIANNA	He was really mad when they broke up.

BRIANNA	I heard them fighting.

DETECTIVE KENT	Well, thank you, Breanna, you've been a really big help.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'm sure you can use your rest.

DETECTIVE KENT	Can you let my office know where she'll be staying?

LUCY	I I'm afraid not. 

LUCY	Your mom didn't fill out the emergency contact person

LUCY	on your paperwork.

LUCY	It's easy to miss,

LUCY	especially when there's so much to fill out.

LUCY	Who's your nearest relative?

BRIANNA	You mean I can't stay here?

LUCY	At the school?

BRIANNA	No, I mean...I don't have any relatives

LUCY	None at all?

BRIANNA	My mom has a cousin,

BRIANNA	Sarah-Louise, but...

BRIANNA	I-I can't go to her.

BRIANNA	She lives hours away and I hardly know her.

LUCY	Do you have her number?

BRIANNA	No.

DETECTIVE KENT	Okay.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'll contact Family Services.

DETECTIVE KENT	They'll be able to set you up with a foster family

DETECTIVE KENT	or a group home 

BRIANNA	No! I can't go to foster care.

BRIANNA	Ms. Hayden, please.

BRIANNA	I-I can't go to a bunch of strangers, okay?

BRIANNA	Not now, please.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'm sorry.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'm afraid that foster care or a group home

DETECTIVE KENT	is your only options.

EVELYN	No they're not!

EVELYN	You can stay with us.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'm sure we can get you a temporary custody order

DETECTIVE KENT	under the circumstances

EVELYN	Mom?

LUCY	Okay

LUCY	Um, at least until we find this cousin,

LUCY	and then we will reassess things.

EVELYN	It'll be okay.

EVELYN	It'll be just like you talked about.

EVELYN	Best friends forever.

BRIANNA	Forever and ever.

LUCY	You girls don't worry about homework or assignments

LUCY	at all today, okay?

LUCY	Your teachers are aware of what's going on, and...

LUCY	you can make up any work once...

LUCY	once things settle down.

EVELYN	Thanks, Mom.

BRIANNA	I think I need to take a shower.

LUCY	You know where everything is, right?

LUCY	I'm sure Evelyn can lend you some clothes.

BRIANNA	Thank you, Ms. Hayden.

BRIANNA	I don't wanna be any trouble.

LUCY	Oh, Breanna, you're not.

LUCY	Please never think that.

EVELYN	Hey, thank you for letting Bree stay here.

BRIANNA	You're the best.

LUCY	I'm proud of you

LUCY	for caring so much and being such a good friend.

EVELYN	Thanks.

EVELYN	I'll do everything I can for her.

LUCY	Detective Kent!

LUCY	Is everything all right?

DETECTIVE KENT 	Yeah, yeah, I just thought Breanna might need

DETECTIVE KENT	a few things from home.

LUCY	Come on in.

DETECTIVE KENT	Thank you.

LUCY	Thank you, that's so thoughtful.

DETECTIVE KENT	I had one of the female officers do the packing.

DETECTIVE KENT	I don't have much of an idea what a teenage girl would need.

LUCY	I'm surprised Breanna has anything left at home.

LUCY	She spends so much time here

LUCY	and the girls are always trading clothes.

DETECTIVE KENT	Well, here we go.

LUCY	Thank you.

LUCY	Would you like to come in?

DETECTIVE KENT	All right.

DETECTIVE KENT 	They seem close.

LUCY	Ever since they met in summer school

LUCY	a couple years ago.

LUCY	Evelyn's always been shy and had trouble making friends,

LUCY	but her issues got worse after her father passed away.

LUCY	She missed quite a bit of school.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'll bet they didn't have a lot of other college-track kids in

DETECTIVE KENT	with the summer slackers, did they?

LUCY	Just the two of them.

LUCY	It's been that way ever since. 

LUCY	You didn't happen to find Breanna's mom's cell phone

LUCY	at her house, did you?

DETECTIVE KENT	Nah, it was smashed pretty bad.

LUCY	I was hoping it would have her cousin's contact info.

LUCY	Maybe Mindy's boyfriend might know?

DETECTIVE KENT	I'd be happy to ask, if we can find him.

DETCETIVE KENT	He seems to have taken off

LUCY	Is that suspicious?

DETECTIVE KENT	Mm-hm.

LUCY	You don't think he'll come for Breanna?

DETECTIVE KENT	We don't even know if he's our guy.

DETECTIVE KENT	Look, whoever the killer is,

DETECTIVE KENT	if he wanted Breanna, he could have done it last night.

LUCY	I guess you're right

LUCY	I don't wanna take any more of your time.

LUCY	Thank you again.

LUCY	I'll show you out? Of course.

EVELYN	...get an apartment,

EVELYN	and it'll be right by the Hollywood sign, right?

EVELYN	It'll be just like you talked about. It's perfect!

LUCY	Hi, girls.

LUCY	Breanna, Detective Kent had some of your things sent over.

LUCY	He though you might need these.

BRIANNA	Oh, thanks!

LUCY	Breanna, do you know if your mom had an address book

LUCY	or a planner, anything like that?

BRIANNA	Uh, I don't know.

BRIANNA	Maybe. Why?

LUCY	I'm hoping it would have her cousin's number.

LUCY	Do you know where she might have kept it?

BRIANNA	Probably in her room, but I'm not sure.

EVELYN	Hey, Mom, we kinda need to be alone.

LUCY	Okay.

LUCY	Let me know if there's anything you girls need.

EVELYN	Yeah. Thanks.

EVELYN	Anyways...yes, red walls.

BRIANA	Yes.

EVELYN	Flowers, maybe.

BRIANNA	Roses everywhere

BRIANNA	Yeah, thank you.

ALEX	Hi, Breanna.

ALEX	I thought you might like these.

ALEX	I'm sorry about your I mean...

ALEX	I know what it's like.

ALEX	Both of my parents are dead, too.

BRIANNA	I didn't know.

BRIANNA	Um...

BRIANNA	Would you like to sit with us?

ALEX	You sure?

BRIANNA	Yeah. Thanks. They're really pretty, thank you. It was a long time ago.	

LUCY	"S" for Sarah-Louise.

LUCY	Hello? 

LUCY	Hello?

LUCY	Is someone there?

EVELYN	I mean, she just called me

EVELYN	and she, like, sprained her ankle falling.

EVELYN	Mom.

BRIANNA	Ms. Hayden.

BRIANNA	Evie, take her bags.

LUCY	You girls are sweet.

LUCY	I'm fine

LUCY	The doctor said I can walk, as long as I don't overdo it.

BRIANNA	God.

BRIANNA	Oh. The tea.

BRIANNA	I just put it on.

BRIANNA	Lemon and one sugar?

LUCY	Yes.

BRIANNA	-Okay.

EVELYN	I should probably go help her.

LUCY	Hold on.

LUCY	Mom I'm sure Breanna can make tea

LUCY	on her own just fine

LUCY	What did you mean when you said,

LUCY	"It will be just like you talked about" to Breanna?

LUCY	You said it in my office

LUCY 	and I overheard you say it again yesterday.

EVELYN	So I'm not the only eavesdropper?

EVELYN	It's no big deal.

LUCY	Then you won't mind

LUCY	telling me about it.

EVELYN	I just meant it'll be like

EVELYN	when Bree talks about us rooming together at college.

LUCY	Honey, we don't even know how long

LUCY	she's gonna be staying with us.

LUCY	Her cousin may want her to come stay with her.

EVELYN	She lives hours away.

LUCY	She's also her family.

LUCY	I'm sure that's what her mom would have wanted.

EVELYN	Who cares what her mom would have wanted?

EVELYN	It's not like she was such a great mom anyways.

LUCY	Evelyn!

EVELYN	She was making Bree move away!

LUCY	You knew about that?

LUCY	Why didn't you say anything?

EVELYN	What's the point?

EVELYN	It's not like talking would have changed anything.

LUCY	That's really mature of you I'm really

EVELYN	Okay, that's not the only thing she did.

EVELYN	She was always dating these gross, creepy guys,

EVELYN	like that Greg.

LUCY	What was gross and creepy about Greg Olson?

EVELYN	Uh, he was always hanging around Bree,

EVELYN	trying to talk to her, wanting to touch her.

EVELYN	Like, totally hitting on her.

EVELYN	And when Mrs. McMillen found out,

EVELYN	that's when she broke up with him.

LUCY	Look.

LUCY	All I'm saying is let's not borrow trouble.

LUCY	Breanna has suffered a big loss, 

LUCY	you have to expect big changes to come from that

LUCY	sooner or later.

BRIANNA	Here we are.

BRIANNA	And I just baked some cookies.

BRIANNA	Do you need a blanket?

LUCY	No, I'm

BRIANNA	Evie, get the red afghan

BRIANNA	in the room.

LUCY	It's really not necessary.

LUCY	This is all very sweet,

LUCY	but you don't have to do this.

BRIANNA	But you've been so good

BRIANNA	letting me stay here.

BRIANNA	Well, I wanna think about something else,

BRIANNA	even if just for a little while?

LUCY	Is that all it is?

LUCY	You can tell me.

BRIANNA	My mom and I,

BRIANNA	we had a fight the night she...

BRIANNA	It was stupid, but...

BRIANNA	I was so mad at her.

BRIANNA	But now she's...

BRIANNA	I feel so bad about it,

BRIANNA	but there's nothing I can do,

BRIANNA	because I I can't see her

BRIANNA	or talk to her or anything.

BRIANNA	Not ever again.

LUCY	Breanna, your mom knows you love her,

LUCY	no matter where she is.

LUCY	And she knows you didn't mean anything you said in anger.

LUCY	Your mom never stopped loving you.

LUCY	Not even for a second.

BRIANNA	How do you know?

LUCY	Because even if they don't like their actions,

LUCY	moms always love their kids.

LUCY	You know I'm always here for you, okay?

BRIANNA	Thank you.

LUCY	Yeah.

LUCY	You know...

JENNA	Breanna, hey.

JENNA	How are you holding up?

EVELYN	She's okay.

EVELYN	Thanks for asking.

JENNA	Okay.

BRIANNA	What's up?

ALEX	Not much, how are you?

BRIANNA	Good.

BRIANNA	What are you reading?

ALEX	Oh, it's Huckleberry Finn.

BRIANNA	Ooh!

LUCY	I had a friend in college,

LUCY 	and every time she got a new boyfriend,

LUCY	I wouldn't see her for two weeks.

LUCY	But she always came back around,

LUCY	and it always gave me a chance to meet some new people.

LUCY	And Jenna Ryder is really friendly

LUCY	and there's room at her table.

EVELYN	I'm not mad about that, it's just...

LUCY	Are you sure?

EVELYN	-It's Alex Tyler.

EVELYN	He doesn't actually like her,

EVELYN	he's just using her to get attention,

EVELYN	to be popular.

LUCY	Sweetie, I don't think

EVELYN	I gotta go.

EVELYN	I'm gonna be late for class.

MS WALSH	Lucy?

MS WALSH	This came for you to the office.

LUCY	Thank you.

LUCY	I asked Breanna McMillen's last school to send over

LUCY	her file.

LUCY	I'm still looking for the contact info

LUCY	for her mom's cousin.

LUCY	Still nothing.

LUCY	I guess it's hard to imagine that the worst

LUCY	will ever actually happen.

MS WALSH	That's a pretty thick file.

LUCY	You're right.

MS WALSH	What is it?

LUCY	It looks like Breanna

LUCY	didn't change schools because they moved.

LUCY	She was expelled.

LUCY	She broke another student's nose

LUCY	I can't even...

LUCY	Breanna McMillen's been in and out of my house

LUCY	almost every day for the last year and a half.

LUCY	I've never seen anything like this from her,

LUCY	especially not anything violent.

MS WALSH	Well, just goes to show,

MS WALSH	you can never really know

LUCY	It says that her problem started after her dad died.

LUCY	Maybe she just needed a fresh start.

MS WALSH	I wouldn't be so sure about that.

MS WALSH	I-I didn't just come here to play Pony Express.

MS WALSH	There's something serious I need to talk to you about.

MS WALSH	Breanna McMillen handed this in to Mr. Drew for English.

MS WALSH	He showed it to me because he thought it was very good,

MS WALSH	very insightful.

LUCY	"Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness

LUCY	has at its center Commander Kurtz,

LUCY	a man driven by his environment and circumstances

LUCY	to commit evil deeds."

LUCY	He's right. I didn't realize she could write this well.

MS WALSH	That's the problem. She can't.

LUCY	"Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness

LUCY	has at its center Commander Kurtz,

LUCY	a man driven by his environment and circumstances..."

LUCY	I see.

MS WALSH	I assigned that same book to my AP English class

MS WALSH	last year.

MS WALSH	I kept a copy of this because it was so good.

LUCY	This was Evelyn's essay.

MS WALSH	I haven't shown it to Mr. Drew yet.

MS WALSH	I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt.

MS WALSH	And Evelyn's worked so hard after her little bit of trouble.

LUCY	Thank you.

LUCY	I appreciate you coming to me first.

LUCY	Will you just let me talk to the girls

LUCY	and get their side of the story?

MS WALSH	Yes, go ahead, I...

MS WALSH	I know it hasn't been easy for you

MS WALSH	raising Evelyn by yourself.

MS WALSH	Especially when she struggled so much.

LUCY	Thank you.

MS WALSH	But I would get that Breanna out of your house.

MS WALSH	It would be a shame if her bad influence

MS WALSH	rubbed off on Evelyn.

EVELYN	Imperfection is beauty

EVELYN	madness is genius,

EVELYN	and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous

EVELYN	than absolutely boring.

BRIANNA	Evie, you don't have to do this.

EVELYN	No, you said it yourself.

EVELYN	Fear is stupid,

EVELYN	and so are regrets.

EVELYN	Ready?

BRIANNA	Ready.

BRIANNA/EVELYN	One, two, three!

EVELYN	My leg!

EVELYN	I-I hit the bottom, I think it's broken!

BREANNA 	Keep going.

BRIANNA	It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

BRIANNA	Oh my God. Can you move it?

EVELYN	 Uhhh...no!

BRIANNA	Oh my God.

EVELYN	You're right. Fear is stupid.

BRIANNA	You're faking.

BRIANNA	You suck.

EVELYN	Come on!

BRIANNA	Oh my God!

BRIANNA	You loser!

LUCY	Who are you? What do you want?

GREG	I'm Greg Olson.

GREG	Hey!

GREG	Hey, stop!

GREG	I need to talk to you.

GREG	I need to

GREG	Hey, I just wanna talk to you, that's it.

GREG	I'm not gonna hurt you.

LUCY	Well, you're not really giving me much of a choice.

GREG	I didn't kill Mindy.

LUCY	You're not doing a very good job of acting like an innocent man.

GREG	I was home the night she was murdered.

GREG	I wanted to be with her, I loved her.

GREG	I would never hurt her, not ever. 

LUCY	Tell it to the police

GREG	You think the boyfriend ex-boyfriend

GREG	isn't always the prime suspect?

GREG	Especially one who has a couple DUIs on his record?

GREG	What's to stop them from pinning it all on me,

GREG	go for an easy conviction, get the case off the books?

GREG	Make everyone look like a rock star...

GREG	except me.

LUCY	How 'bout the truth?

GREG	That's what I'm hoping for.

GREG	I'm a victim here too.

GREG	I know what it looks like, but I'm a good guy.

LUCY	Not a bad guy,

LUCY	but you hit on your girlfriend's teenage daughter?

GREG	That little brat!

GREG	Is that what she told you?

GREG	I never did that

GREG	The only time I ever touched her

GREG	was the day that I shook her hand when Mindy introduced us.

LUCY	That's clearly not what Mindy thought.

GREG	Because Breanna lied.


GREG	She saw we were getting close and didn't want a stepdad.

LUCY	 Why wouldn't Breanna want a want a stepdad?

GREG	I wasn't falling forher little lost girl act.

GREG	I wasn't gonna, you know, tolerate her manipulation

GREG	and lies.

LUCY	Why are you telling me all this?

GREG	Mindy was killed with a hypodermic needle

GREG	filled with animal tranquilizer.

GREG	And her dart gun is missing.

GREG	And who had the most access to it?

LUCY	So you think Breanna killed her own mother.

GREG	Tell that to the boys in blue.

LUCY	Okay, you know what?

LUCY	I just wanna make sure I get all this.

LUCY	I wanna write this down, so. You little...

MUSIQUE	Cat fighting ? Oh, what a maze ?

MUSIQUE	Tell me where, when does it end ?

MUSIQUE	Cat fighting ?

MUSIQUE	Cat fighting ?

FEMALE SINGER	Ooh, what a maze ?

MUSIQUE	Cat fighting ?

MUSIQUE	Meow, meow ??

BRIANNA	Lay down and close your eyes.

BRIANNA	Just do it.

EVELYN	Okay.

BRIANNA	Okay. On three, we'll open

BRIANNA	Okay?

EVELYN	Okay.

EVELYN	One, two, three.

EVELYN	Wow.

EVELYN	It's perfect.

LUCY	Evelyn? Breanna?

EVELYN	Do you like it?

LUCY	Remember I told you our plan?

EVELYN	It's the midnight sky.

LUCY	Remember I told you

LUCY	to hold off on redecorating?

EVELYN	Evelyn, I was clear

LUCY	Mom, it's my room.

LUCY	Okay, we will address this later.

LUCY	Breanna, something very serious has been brought to my attention

LUCY	and we need to discuss it.

LUCY	It's very serious, it's about your essay for Mr. Drew.

BRIANNA	What about it?

LUCY	We know that

LUCY	you didn't write it. 

LUCY	Not really.

BRIANNA	What?

LUCY	Don't you realize

LUCY	you could've gotten Evelyn into a lot of trouble?

EVELYN	Evelyn...what's she got to do with my essay?

LUCY	Mr. Drew showed it to Mrs. Walsh

LUCY	and she recognized it as one too similar

LUCY	to one that she had received last year.

BRIANNA	I don't understand what you're saying.

BRIANNA	I haven't even turned in my essay yet.

LUCY	-What? I'm still working on it.

BRIANNA	He gave me an extension until Monday, I...

BRIANNA	I have my notes and my outline on my laptop.

LUCY	Mr. Drew received this essay with your name on it.

BRIANNA	I've never seen this before in my life.

LUCY	Breanna, please don't try to lie and cover this up.

LUCY	You're only going to make it worse.

BRIANNA	I'm not lying.

BRIANNA	Why don't you believe me?

LUCY	I saw a copy of the records from your last school.

LUCY	We know all about the fight and you getting expelled.

BRIANNA	I didn't want anyone to know about that.

BRIANNA	I knew they'd judge me for it.

LUCY	It does make it very hard to believe you now,

LUCY	especially when I have the proof in my own hands.

BRIANNA	Okay, I got into some trouble.

BRIANNA	But even at my old school, I never cheated,

BRIANNA	I would never do that.

EVELYN	It was me.

BRIANNA	What?

EVELYN	I turned in the essay with Breanna's name on it.

EVELYN	I I put it in his mailbox this morning,

EVELYN	but she didn't have anything to do with it,

EVELYN	I swear.

BRIANNA	Evie, what were you thinking?

BRIANNA	I coulda got into so much trouble.

EVELYN	But I didn't know Mr. Drew would show it to Ms. Walsh.

EVELYN	I was just trying to help

EVELYN	You're my best friend.

EVELYN	Right? Best friends would do anything for each other

LUCY	I have a very hard time believing that you did this

LUCY	entirely without prompting from Breanna.

BRIANNA	See what you did?

BRIANNA	Now everybody thinks I'm a liar and a cheat.

EVELYN	But I did it for you

BRIANNA	No.

BRIANNA	I don't wanna hear it.

BRIANNA	I can't believe you'd do this to me.

BRIANNA	Evie...

LUCY	Let her go.

LUCY	She'll come back when she calms down.

BRIANNA	You hate me now?

LUCY	I don't hate you.

BRIANNA	Even if Evelyn gets in trouble for trying to help me?

BRIANNA	It's okay

BRIANNA	You're not my mom.

BRIANNA	You don't have to love me

BRIANNA	even when you don't lovemy actions.

LUCY	Breanna, I just

BRIANNA	Can I get back to work now,please?

LUCY	Finally. Hello?

LUCY	Hi, uh, you don't know me,

LUCY	but my name's Lucy Hayden.

LUCY	I I'm looking for Mindy McMillen's cousin.

SARAH	That's me. Why?

SARAH	Is anything wrong?

LUCY	Um, I'm afraid so.

LUCY	Mindy's dead.

LUCY	She was murdered.

SARAH	Oh, I can't believe this.

SARAH	Breanna. Is Breanna okay?

LUCY	She's fine. In fact,

LUCY	she's staying with me and my daughter, Evelyn,

LUCY	the girls are best friends, while we tried to reach you.

SARAH	Tried to?

SARAH	I don't understand.

LUCY	Well, I'll text you the number of the detective

LUCY	in charge of Mindy's case.

LUCY	He'll be able to explain more to you than I can.

SARAH	Thank you, and thank you for letting me know.

LUCY	I'm sorry, I don't even know where it is that you live.

SARAH	Fort Pierce. Oh.

LUCY	That's only 90 minutes away.

LUCY	I'd be happy to come to you to discuss everything with her.

SARAH	Would Sunday be too soon? No, the sooner the better.

SARAH	Thank you for taking care of Breanna.

SARAH	-Poor child.

LUCY	Again, I'm so sorry

LUCY	for your loss.

LUCY	Goodbye

LUCY	Ow.

LUCY	Who's out there?

LUCY	I'm gonna call the police.

LUCY	Oh, seriously?

LUCY	Show yourself.

LUCY	I'm calling the police

EVELYN	Hey, is everything okay?

LUCY	Someone's out there.

LUCY	Get inside.

EVELYN	It's probably just the neighbor's cat.

EVELYN	He cuts through the yard sometimes.

BRIANNA	Ms. Hayden.

BRIANNA	Did you get locked out?

BRIANNA	I thought I heard knocking.

LUCY	I'm sorry.

LUCY	I'm really tired

LUCY	Um, it's been a long day,

LUCY	we could all use some rest.

LUCY	Hey

LUCY	Talk to you in the morning.

EVELYN	Bree?

EVELYN	Can you forgive me?

BRIANNA	Yes. Of course.

BRIANNA 	It's been a terrible week.

BRIANNA	A terrible, terrible week, okay?

EVELYN	I'm so sorry

BRIANNA	No, of course.

BRIANNA	I I'm sorry too.

EVELYN	You know you mean everything to me, right?

EVELYN	Best friends forever.

BRIANNA	Forever and ever.

EVELYN	Oh, good, there's coffee.

LUCY	Hold on.

LUCY	You owe me a talk.

EVELYN	Mom, Bree's coffeeis gonna get cold

EVELYN	and she hates cold coffee.

LUCY	Bree can make herself

LUCY	some more coffee

LUCY	Do you realize how much trouble

LUCY	you could have gotten into for that essay stunt?

LUCY	What made you think of doing such a thing?

EVELYN	Bree was really worried

EVELYN	about getting kicked off the college track.

EVELYN	She said she might not even be able

EVELYN	to get into state then.

LUCY	So she asked you to help her.

EVELYN	No, it wasn't like that.

LUCY	She didn't have to.

LUCY	She knows how much going to college together means to you.

LUCY	She just had to make you think there was a chance

LUCY	she couldn't go and let you draw your own conclusions.

EVELYN	Mom, she didn't make me do anything.

LUCY	Look, I know you think she's your friend,

LUCY	but she is manipulating you.

LUCY	You have to ask yourself if her words and actions

LUCY	are those of a true friend.

EVELYN	She didn't make me

EVELYN	do anything, I swear.

LUCY	Fine. I believe you.

LUCY	I'll I'll tell Mr. Drew it was just a misunderstanding.

LUCY	Breanna can turn in her essay on Monday.

LUCY	And no more helping.

LUCY	From here on out, Breanna has to do

LUCY	all her work on her own. Your future depends on this, Evelyn.

EVELYN	Okay, fine.

EVELYN	Can I go now?

LUCY	Hey, can I have a hug first?

BRIANNA	Hey, what's up?

LUCY	Oh, God!

EVELYN	Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

LUCY	It is okay. I will just change my shirt.

LUCY	Uh, I'll pick up some pizza for dinner tonight.

LUCY	See you girls tonight.

EVELYN	Thanks, Mom.

EVELYN	Oh, Bree doesn't like mushrooms.

JENNA	Hey, Ms. Hayden. Jenna.

LUCY	What brings you into school on a Saturday?

JENNA	Band practice for the spring musical

JENNA	I was hoping maybe Evelyn would reconsider

JENNA	coming back this year.

JENNA	We could really use an oboe player.

JENNA	Our reed section is a little thin.

LUCY	I think the girls decided against

LUCY	the school musical this year,

LUCY	but I'll be sure to bring up your invitation

LUCY	to Evelyn and Breanna.

JENNA	Not Breanna.

JENNA	I mean, we have a pianist already.

LUCY	Okay, well, I will just tell Evelyn,

LUCY	but if I were you I'd keep up the oboe search.

JENNA	Do you know why Evelyn doesn't like us?

JENNA	The other band kids, I mean.

JENNA	Did we do something to offend her or something?

LUCY	What? No. I'm sure that's not true.

LUCY	What would make you ask that?

JENNA	Last year, we kept asking her

JENNA	to hang out and do stuff after rehearsals.

JENNA	We invited Breanna, too, of course,

JENNA	but they just wanted to be together.

JENNA	Even if Breanna had something to do with her mom or whatever,

JENNA	Evelyn wouldn't hang out with us.

LUCY	Did she say why not?

JENNA	She said something like,

JENNA	"Breanna wouldn't like it."

LUCY	Well, I will bring this up to Evelyn,

LUCY	and we'll just have to see if she'll reconsider

LUCY	when things settle down a bit.

JENNA	Thanks, Ms. Hayden.

LUCY	Hello

LUCY	I come bearing pizza, mushroom-free.

LUCY	What are you doing out here?

LUCY	Come on, don't tell me that Breanna changed her mind

LUCY	about mushrooms.

EVELYN	No.

LUCY	What's up?

EVELYN	Nothing.

LUCY	Would that nothing be named Breanna?

EVELYN	No.

LUCY	Where is she?

EVELYN	She's finishing her essay.

LUCY	Good.

LUCY	I'm glad she's taking it seriously.

EVELYN	Yeah, well, she would have been done by now

EVELYN	if she hadn't been gone all day.

LUCY	Gone? Where'd she go?

LUCY	I don't know.

EVELYN	She wouldn't tell me.

EVELYN	She wouldn't let me go with her either.

LUCY	You know, even best friends need some time apart.

JENNA	Jenna stopped by my office today

LUCY	to see if maybe you wanted to join the band

LUCY	for the school musical after all?

EVELYN	No, they just need an oboe player.

LUCY	She said that, but she's also afraid

LUCY	that you don't like her and the other band kids.

LUCY	I think she really wants to be your friend.

LUCY	Why don't you give her a chance?

LUCY	I know that you still struggle

LUCY	with your shyness and anxiety,

LUCY	but you can talk to me.

LUCY	And if you want, I can make you another appointment.

EVELYN	God, Mom, I don't want to talk to anybody, okay?

EVELYN	I don't need other friends,I have I have Bree.

BRIANNA	Nobody understands.

BRIANNA	I couldn't tell anybody this.

BRIANNA	Ever.

LUCY	Breanna?

BRIANNA	Sh, I have to go.

LUCY	Breanna, what are you doing up?

LUCY	It's the middle of the night.

BRIANNA	I couldn't sleep. Who are you talking to?

BRIANNA	No one.

LUCY	Breanna.

BRIANNA	It's private.

LUCY	That's not

LUCY	an acceptable answer.

LUCY	Evelyn said you were gone all day

LUCY	without letting me know where you were.

BRIANNA	I just went to the mall.

LUCY	You still should have told me.

LUCY	Let me see your phone.

BRIANNA	No.

BRIANNA	I don't have to show you.

BRIANNA	You're not my mom.

LUCY	I know.

LUCY	But you're under my roof and I'm responsible for you.

LUCY	That means that I get to set rules and boundaries,

LUCY	including knowing who you're speaking to.

LUCY	But I would never try to replace your mom.

BRIANNA	Well, that's good.

BRIANNA	What are moms good for anyway?

BRIANNA	They jerk you around from place to place.

BRIANNA	They date whoever they want.

BRIANNA	Even if you hate them.

BRIANNA	They don't care about how you feel

BRIANNA	or what you need.

BRIANNA	I never want a mom again.

LUCY	I know that you're going through a hard time, but 

BRIANNA	You don't know anything about me.

BRIANNA	I'm glad you're not my mom

BRIANNA	I wish I never had one.

LUCY	Breanna!

LUCY	Breanna

LUCY	Sarah-Louise?

LUCY	It's Lucy Hayden.

LUCY	Sarah-Louise?

LUCY	This was a wasted trip.

LUCY	Its warm

DETECTIVE KENT	Lucy?

LUCY	Detective Kent, what are you doing here?

DETECTIVE KENT	Well, they called me in

DETECTIVE KENT	since the victim's connected to one of mine.

LUCY	I just don't understand

LUCY	why someone would do something like this.

DETECTIVE KENT	Yeah, it's a hard thing to wrap your head around, but...

DETECTIVE KENT	At least we know one thing.

DETECTIVE KENT	Sarah-Louise wasn't killed by Greg Olson.

LUCY	How do you know that?

DETECTIVE KENT	Well, 'cause he was in

DETECTIVE KENT	my station when she died.

LUCY	So you finally ran him down?

DETECTIVE KENT	It's more like he came to his senses.

DETECTIVE KENT	Walked in on his own.

DETECTIVE KENT	And he doesn't look too good

DETECTIVE KENT	for Mindy McMillen's death either.

DETECTIVE KENT	Neighbor swears she saw him sleeping

DETECTIVE KENT	in his living room with all the lights still on.

DETECTIVE KENT	She was out walking her dog

DETECTIVE KENT	right around the same time she died.

LUCY	So we have no idea who killed Mindy either?

LUCY	I it's gotta be someone who knew about the dart gun,

LUCY	someone who had access to it.

DETECTIVE KENT	Unfortunately, a lot of people

DETECTIVE KENT	knew about her work as a vet.

LUCY	But did they know where she kept the gun?

DETECTIVE KENT	What are you saying? Excuse me, I'm gonna go see what they want.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'll be back.

EVELYN	Hey, Mom, where are you?

LUCY	It's a long story, I'll tell you when I get home.

EVELYN	Are you okay?

EVELYN	Maybe you should tell me now.

EVELYN	Was that a police siren?

LUCY	I'll tell you when I get back.

LUCY	Is Breanna there?

EVELYN	Um, yeah, she's here.

EVELYN	She's working on her essay.

EVELYN	She would have had it done by now

EVELYN	if I could have just helped her a little bit.

LUCY	Not now, Evelyn

LUCY	Put me on speaker.

EVELYN	Okay.

LUCY	Can you girls hear me?

LUCY	This is very important.

LUCY	I need you to lock the doors and stay in the house.

LUCY	No going out, no guests over.

LUCY	Don't even open the door, even if you know the person.

LUCY	Especially you, Breanna, do you understand?

EVELYN	Yes, Mom.

BRIANNA	Yes, Ms. Hayden.

LUCY	Good, I  

LUCY	I don't mean to scare you girls,

LUCY	but I need you to take this seriously.

LUCY	I'll be home in about an hour and a half.

LUCY	I love you girls.

EVELYN	Love you. Bye.

BRIANNA	Bye.

BRIANNA	Your mom said she loved me

EVELYN	Yeah, why wouldn't she?

BRIANNA	She was so mad about the phone call last night.

EVELYN	Well, she gets mad all the time.

EVELYN	It never lasts.

BRIANNA	Yeah, my mom was like that too.

EVELYN	Do you miss her?

BRIANNA	Maybe that's why this essay is taking forever.

EVELYN	Maybe you need a study break.

EVELYN	We could make some popcorn and watch a movie.

EVELYN	Niagara or Don't Bother to Knock.

BRIANNA	I I really shouldn't.

BRIANNA	It's due tomorrow and it has to be

BRIANNA	at least as good

EVELYN	I could help you.

BRIANNA	I don't know.

EVELYN	Just with, like,

EVELYN	grammar and spellcheck.

EVELYN	That's not cheating.

EVELYN	That's something you can do online.

BRIANNA	I guess that'd be okay.

EVELYN	Actually, I need you to do something for me first.

BRIANNA	Anything.

EVELYN	Tell me where you were yesterday.

BRIANNA	Why do you want to know that?

EVELYN	Because...

EVELYN	if we're best friends,

EVELYN	we should tell each other everything.

EVELYN	We can't keep secrets between us.

BRIANNA	Okay, but you can't tell anyone. 

BRIANNA	Ever.

EVELYN	Yeah, okay.

BRIANNA	I mean it.

BRIANNA	Especially not your mom.

EVELYN	Cross my heart.

LUCY	Detective Kent?

LUCY	Detective?

LUCY	Are you girls okay?

EVELYN	Yeah, Mom, we're fine.

EVELYN	We'll be down in a second.

LUCY	I'll wait down here for you. panting

LUCY	What now?

LUCY	I swear, Evelyn

LUCY	if I find one more red lipstick

LUCY	melted in this dryer.

LUCY	Hello?

LUCY	Detective Kent, I just found a tranquilizer dart

LUCY	in Breanna's clothes.

LUCY	Evelyn said she went off by herself yesterday

LUCY	and and wouldn't say where she went,

LUCY	but we know she knows where Sarah-Louise lives.

DETECTIVE KENT	That's not all.

LUCY	What?

DETECTIVE KENT	The neighbors reported seeing a strange car in the area

DETECTIVE KENT	right around the same time Sarah-Louise was killed.

DETECTIVE KENT	It matches Mindy's car.

DETECTIVE KENT	Lucy, would would Breanna have a key?

LUCY	No, I I borrowed Mindy's keys

LUCY	when I went to grab her address book.

LUCY 	I have 'em right here.

LUCY	They're not in my purs.

LUCY	I just had them.

LUCY	I caught Breanna making a phone call to someone last night,

LUCY	and we got in an argument and she said 

LUCY	she said she wished she never had a mom.

DETECTIVE KENT	Here's what you're gonna do

DETECTIVE KENT	Call Child Protection Services and tell 'em

DETEVTIVE KENT	you're surrendering custody of Breanna immediately.

DETECTIVE KENT	They'll send somebody to get her.

LUCY	Evelyn's gonna be heartbroken

DETECTIEV KENT	Well, she'll have you to get her through it, okay?

DETECTIVE KENT	Call me if you need anything.

LUCY	Okay, thank you.

LUCY	Hi, I am looking for Child Protection Services.

LUCY	I need to surrender my temporary custody

LUCY	of a minor.

LUCY	Her name's Breanna McMillen.

LUCY	Do you have her file?

LUCY	Okay, good.

LUCY	How soon can you send someone to pick her up?

LUCY	Okay, great.

LUCY	Thank you so much. Yes, I 

EVELYN	Mom, what are you doing?

LUCY	Evelyn, I'm sorry.

LUCY	But she cannot stay here.

LUCY	I know how much you care about her,

LUCY	but it is not safe.

LUCY	Evelyn, you have to trust me here.	

LUCY	I have your best interest in heart.

LUCY	Sweetie, it's not safe.

EVELYN	Not safe, not safe.

EVELYN	Mom, what are you talking about?

EVELYN	Why did you make us stay inside?

BRIANNA	Hi.

LUCY	Breanna.

LUCY	Hi.

BRIANNA	Your tea's ready.

LUCY	Thank you.

EVELYN	We were just talking about you, actually.

BRIANNA	All good things?

LUCY	Yes, of course.

BRIANNA	Care to share?

BRIANNA	Ow!

EVELYN	Bree!

LUCY	Are you okay?

BRIANNA	Mm-hm.

BRIANNA	It's not that deep.

LUCY	Looks like you need a Band-Aid.

EVELYN	Here, I'll help.

LUCY	Nope. Breanna's got it.

LUCY	The Band-Aids are in the bathroom medicine cabinet,

LUCY	top shelf.

LUCY	Breanna.

LUCY	The knife.

BRIANNA	Right, here you go.

LUCY	Mindy's cousin is dead.

EVELYN	That's why you made us stay inside?

EVELYN	That doesn't mean someone wants to kill Breanna.

EVELYN	Who would want to kill Breanna?

LUCY	That's not what I mean

LUCY	There are signs, evidence even,

LUCY	that Breanna might be involved.

EVELYN	No.

EVELYN	No, Bree wouldn't kill anybody.

LUCY	I don't know that.

LUCY	She might be sick, she might need help,

LUCY	but if she's dangerous, she can't stay here.

EVELYN	We can't send her away, not now.

EVELYN	Not after everything we've been through.

LUCY	You are the most important thing in the world to me.

EVELYN	You can't do this! You know what she means to me!

EVELYN	We're best friends. 

EVELYN	I'm I'm nothing without her.

LUCY	She's made you feel that way so she can use you.

EVELYN	No.

EVELYN	No.

EVELYN	If she's going, I'm going too.

LUCY	Evelyn, she is not your friend.

EVELYN	You're wrong.

EVELYN	She's my best friend forever.

EVELYN	Forever and ever.

EVELYN	Bree!

LUCY	It's gonna be okay, okay?

LUCY	Evelyn.

LUCY	Hey.

LUCY	CPS is gonna be here soon, so I'm gonna go help Breanna

LUCY	-gather up her things.

BRIANNA	No, I should be the one

BRIANNA	to tell her.

LUCY	Nope.

LUCY	You're gonna stay here. No, she's my friend.

LUCY	Stay here.

LUCY	Breanna, are you okay?

LUCY	I need to talk to you.

EVELYN	Where is she? Where'd she go?

LUCY	"Dear Ms. Hayden, I didn't tell you

LUCY	how to contact my mom's cousin

LUCY	because I wanted to stay with you and Evelyn

LUCY	and not have to move away and start over again.

LUCY	You said you loved me, but now you're sending me away.

LUCY	I was right about never wanting a mom again.

LUCY	I'm leaving.You'll never see me again.

LUCY	Breanna."

EVELYN	Sh she's gone?

LUCY	I'll have to call CPS and the police.

LUCY	They're gonna go have to look for her.

EVELYN	She she left me?

EVELYN	No, I don't believe it.

EVELYN	We're best friends, she said so.

LUCY	Evelyn.

EVELYN	This is all your fault.

LUCY	What? No.

EVELYN	I'm never gonna see my best friend again because of you! I need her! I'm nothing without her

LUCY	Evelyn, it's gonna be No!

LUCY	Evelyn.

EVELYN	I'm sorry.

LUCY	Evelyn. Evelyn, we need to talk about this.

EVELYN	It won't happen again.

LUCY	No, I don't care about that

EVELYN	I need to be alone right now.

LUCY	I don't think that's a good 

EVELYN	I need to be alone!

LUCY	Okay, well, I have some calls to make.

LUCY	You promise me you're gonna be okay?

LUCY	And do you promise you're gonna stay in this room?

EVELYN	I'll be fine.

LUCY	Give me your phone.

LUCY	Give me your phone.

BRIANNA	Hey, there's gonna be a little change of plans

BRIANNA	Is that okay?

ALEX	Yeah.

ALEX	Sure, sure, whatever you need.

ALEX	Hey.

ALEX	Yesterday was really amazing.

ALEX	I, um, I've never done that before.

BRIANNA	It yeah, it was it was amazing.

BRIANNA	And I haven't either.

BRIANNA	Ever.

BRIANNA	So...

ALEX	I love you.

BRIANNA	Don't say that.

BRIANNA	Please.

ALEX	But what I 

BRIANNA	Just...don't.

BRIANNA	Okay?

BRIANNA	Everyone that says they love me leaves me.

BRIANNA	Or they die.

ALEX	Okay.

ALEX	Yeah, yeah, whatever you want.

BRIANNA	We need to get to Long Leaf Drive.

ALEX	No problem.

LUCY	She needs time.

LUCY	Just give her time.

DETECTIVE KENT	What's going on in that head of yours?

LUCY	Hello?

LUCY	Who's out there?

DETECTIVE KENT	Lucy, it's Detective Kent, let me in.

DETECTIVE KENT	Lucy?

LUCY	Detective Kent, what is it? Did you find Breanna?

DETECTIVE KENT	No, but we found a boy from her high school.

DETECTIVE KENT	His name is Alex.

LUCY	Alex Tyler?

DETECTIVE KENT	Yeah, he's dead.

DETECTIVE KENT	And we found this in his hand.

LUCY	I didn't wantto believe it, but...

DETECTIVE KENT	It's worse than that.Turn it over.

LUCY	Th this is Evelyn's pendant.

LUCY	Evelyn never takes it off.

DETECTIVE KENT	Yeah. Where is she now?

LUCY	She's upstairs.

LUCY	We had a fight and oh God.

LUCY	Evelyn?

LUCY	Evelyn? Evelyn?

LUCY	Are you in there? Open this door!

DETECTIVE KENT	Here, let me.

LUCY	I would have seen her if she left.

LUCY	I've I've had her phone the whole time.

LUCY	Been downstairs the whole time and 

DETECTIVE KENT	She could have used the email app on the computer.

DETECTIVE KENT	She must have gone over the railing.

LUCY	Yeah.

LUCY	It's a straight drop.

LUCY	Evelyn's terrified of heights.

DETECTIVE KENT	Well, she must have really wanted to go to Breanna.

LUCY	So, Breanna enticed Evelyn out to kidnap her?

LUCY	But why? I don't understand.

DETECIVE KENT	I don't know either.

DETECTIVE KENT	All I know is, Alex's car is missing,

DETECTIVE KENT	presume Breanna took it.

DETECTIVE KENT	Lucy, do you have any idea where they could be?

LUCY	I don't know. I mean...

LUCY	Breanna could have tried to go home.

DETECTIVE KENT	I already sent people over there.

DETECTIVE KENT	Said the place was dark.

DETECTIVE KENT	There's no sign of anybody.

DETECTIVE KENT	Look, we'll keep everybody updated

DETECTIVE KENT	and we'll keep looking, okay?

LUCY	I'm going out, too.

DETECTIVE KENT	No, you're not.

DETECTIVE KENT	Breanna is disturbed, a very dangerous girl.

LUCY	I can't just sit here and wait.

DETECTIVE KENT	I'm sorry, it's too dangerous.

DETECTIVE KENT	You need to stay here and let us handle this.

LUCY	You'll call me as soon as you hear anything

DETECTIVE KENT	Yeah, I will.

LUCY	Thank you, Detective.

LUCY	Breanna!

DETECTIVE KENT	Detective Kent, leave a message.

LUCY	Detective Kent, I'm at the McMillens'.

LUCY	I drove by and the lights are on

LUCY	I think that Breanna is here.

LUCY	Please

LUCY	Please hurry.

LUCY	Breanna?

BRIANNA	I'm covered in gasoline.

BRIANNA	We have to get out of here.

LUCY	I don't under what happened?

LUCY	I don't understand.

BRIANNA	I don't know.

BRIANNA	Evie messaged me on the app and said

BRIANNA	she figured out a way I didn't have to go

BRIANNA	and needed to see me,

BRIANNA	so I had Alex take me to where she said to meet.

BRIANNA	She was so mad I was with him, she shot him.

LUCY	What? I I don't know.

LUCY	How could how could she do this?

BRIANNA	I don't know.

EVELYN	It takes a smart brunette to play a dumb blonde.

LUCY	Evelyn

EVELYN	You can't be here.

EVELYN	You shouldn't be here.

LUCY	I know that you're scared, sweetie.

LUCY	I just I want to help you.

LUCY	Put that down

EVELYN	You don't want to help me.

EVELYN	You want to keep us apart.

EVELYN	You and everyone wants to keep us apart.

EVELYN	Ms. McMillen and then Sarah-Louise

EVELYN	and then Alex and now you.

LUCY	I just want you to be happy, sweetie.

EVELYN	If you wanted me to be happy,

EVELYN	you wouldn't try to take Bree from me.

EVELYN	I need her. I'm nothing without her.

EVELYN	Nothing!

EVELYN	Bree.

EVELYN	I'll make sure that we'll never be apart ever again.

EVELYN	It'll be like you always talked about.

BRIANNA	Evie, please don't do this.

EVELYN	With the clouds all around and...

EVELYN	and the stars up above.

EVELYN	First you and then me.

EVELYN	And then we'll always be together.

LUCY	What what are you saying?

EVELYN	It's just like you always said, Bree.

EVELYN	We are all of us stars.

EVELYN	We deserve to twinkle.

EVELYN	Best friends. Forever and ever.

LUCY	Evelyn, no!

LUCY	Evelyn.

LUCY	Evelyn.

BRIANNA	I never wanted any of this.

LUCY	I know, I'm sorry I thought it was you.

LUCY	I have been so blind.

LUCY	I should have known, I should have seen

BRIANNA	I didn't see it either.

DETCTIVE KENT	Lucy!

DETECTIVE KENT	Lucy, are you okay?

LUCY	It was Evelyn she confessed.

DETECTIVE KENT	She's alive.

LUCY	Seems like you've made a lot of friends.

EVELYN	Oh, but I'm not I mean, I 

EVELYN	I like them all the same.

LUCY	Except maybe Tyler

LUCY	You like Tyler more?

EVELYN	No, less.

EVELYN	He he can be annoying, but only sometimes.

LUCY	I think that's more than fair.

EVELYN	I'm sorry.

EVELYN	I'm sorry I 

EVELYN	I did such terrible things.

EVELYN	And I don't even  I didn't even want to, really,

EVELYN	I just I don't I don't know why I did.

LUCY	I'm sorry too.

LUCY	I should have known.

LUCY	I should have seen it. I don't know how I missed it.

LUCY	I guess I just wanted to think that...

LUCY	But I should have made you get help.

LUCY	And I know now I'm gonna do everything

LUCY	I can to help you.

LUCY	I'm still here for you

LUCY	and I still love you just the same.

LUCY	She's doing better, much better.

LUCY	The doctors are really pleased with her progress.

BRIANNA	That's good

BRIANNA	Um...

BRIANNA	I can't help but feel like part of this was my fault.

LUCY	You can't blame yourself

LUCY	Evelyn's disorder progressed incredibly quickly,

LUCY	turning a normal friendship into an obsession

LUCY	in a matter of weeks, maybe even days.

LUCY	They they said we couldn't have expected

LUCY	or predicted any of this.
