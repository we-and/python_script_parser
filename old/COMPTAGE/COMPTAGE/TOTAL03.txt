CAROLINA	Pietro and I left to shoot a beauty editorial, all expenses paid by the biggest cosmetic company in Brazil.

ELIZA	What are you doing here, Dino?

DINO	I thought it was empty.

ELIZA	You were wrong.

GILDA	Dino is good to us. He took care of me when I most needed it, and treated you like his own daughter.

ELIZA	If you come any closer, I'll stab you

DINO	Yeah? Really? Then come try. (reaction)

GILDA	You need to flee. Go, go fast. Go to your room, get some, some, some clothes. Go.

CAROLINA	This trip can be life changing for my magazine.

BINO		Where are you headed to?

ELIZA	Where are you headed to?

BINO	Rio de Janeiro.

ELIZA	So, that's where I am going.

BINO		What are you doing by yourself in the middle of the highway, girl? That's dangerous.

ELIZA	It's even more dangerous where I was.

BINO	Your boyfriend won't be down the road waiting to jump me, will he?

ELIZA	I don't have a boyfriend. And I am not a thief.

BINO	So what are you?

ELIZA	I just needed a ride, I've told you that already. If you don't want to give me a ride, look, you can stop the truck and I'll figure something eles out, it's okay.

BINO		Calm down, calm down (laughs). I'm not that crazy to leave you in the middle of nowhere, girl.

ELIZA	My name is Eliza.

BINO	Eliza. Running away from home, right?

ELIZA	That's none of your business.

BINO		You are so rude for someone that is in need of a favor. But that okay. I have a daughter your age, and she talks back just as much as you.

ELIZA		(laughs) I'm sorry. My dad is also a truck driver, did you know that? Francisco, Francisco de Assis.

BINO	I don't know him.

ELIZA		I've spent a lot of time on this highway, waiting for him to pick me up, (reaction) but... Life had different plans for me, life had me traveling alone.

BINO		You can relax, I am not going to take advantage of you. You are lucky you are traveling with me. There are a lot of bad people traveling this road.

ELIZA	(reaction) They are worse at home.

BINO		Are you hungry? There is a sandwich over there. You can have it. Go ahead, eat it.

ARTHUR	You know what I wanted?

CAROLINA	What did you want? (laughs)

ARTHUR	Let me speak.

CAROLINA	(reaction – scared) Germano, germano.

ARTHUR	I'm going to talk to him

GERMANO	Carolina. Carolina!

ARTHUR	Dr. Germano, do you have insomnia?

GERMANO		I am having some trouble to sleep. It must be the trip and jet lag. I'm not feeling too well. So I came to see if Carolina had anything to help me out.

ARTHUR		Oh! Don't you worry about that. Come with me to my room, I have something that will make you sleep like a baby.

GERMANO		No, I am okay, thank you. I am going back to my room, actually, before Lili wakes up. If she wakes up and doesn't see me, she might get worried.

ARTHUR		Okay, but if you need anything I'm in room three, zero, three.

GERMANO	Okay, thank you.

ARTHUR	Yeah.

GERMANO	Goodnight. (reaction) Note to self, next time do not let Carolina bring this fool along.

CAROLINA		(reaction) Oh my gosh, that man is unruly. I hope I make it through this trip.

ARTHUR		And his wife has an eye on you. You better be careful, huh?

CAROLINA		That's why you came along. To make sure she is entertained.

ARTHUR		Aw! I thought it was because of my irresistible company.

CAROLINA		(laughs) You thought incorrectly. Where do you think you are going?

ARTHUR	Uhh? I thought we were going to resume where  we  had left off.

CAROLINA	You thought incorrectly, again (laughs).

CAROLINA		Oh, Arthur, tomorrow is such an important day for me, we have a photoshoot, we have to go to an island. I think I need to get some good sleep.

ARTHUR	Work always comes first, right?

CAROLINA		Yes, and that's why I am where I am today. Goodnight. 

ARTHUR	Goodnight. 

BINO		Eliza, be careful around here, okay? This neighborhood is kind of dangerous.

ELIZA	Okay.

BINO		Go down this street, since there are a lot of people around. Turn right on the 3rd street, and you'll find Fatima's Pension. She's a friend of mine.

ELIZA	Okay.

BINO		You can trust her. Tell her that Bino sent you. My passion is the road, but she owns my heart.

ELIZA	Thank you for everything

BINO	I hope you find your father.

ELIZA	I lost all hopes, since I've left home without him.

JONATAS		What's up, red head? Are you lost already? Need help?

ELIZA		Don't worry about it. Hey! Do you know this street? Do you know where I can find this pension?

JONATAS		You have to cross this street, go behind the church, and take the first right. I can take you there.

ELIZA	I know how to walk by myself.

JONATAS	Where I am from, people just say “thank you."

RISCADO	Wow! She's a hottie, huh?

JONATAS	Yeah, but she is as stubborn as she is hot.

RISCADO	What do we have here, huh, red head?

JONATAS	Beautiful, aren't you?

RISCADO	What is this?

JACARÉ		Stop smiling, bro. You're time will come, okay? I'll get you by myself. 

ELIZA	Hi.

FATIMA		You can't turn tricks here, and you need to pay in advance.

ELIZA		Hey! I'm not a prostutude. I am just looking for a room. 

ELIZA	My name is Eliza. Bino the truck driver sent me here. 

FATIMA	Bino?

ELIZA	Yes.

FATIMA	Did he ask you to tell me anything?

ELIZA	He said that you owned his heart, ma'am (laughs)

RECEPCIONISTA	Jerk, isn't he? He says that to every girl.

FATIMA		No one asked for your opinion okay? Look, girl, I'm not old enough to be a "ma'am”. You can call me Fatima. Here, you pay per night. This is the payment chart, love.

RECEPCIONISTA		That one over there has money, huh? She is going to want a presedential suite.

FATIMA		Don't worry, all rooms are the same. And there is a shareable bathroom. Wait here. Excuse me. This is your key. Welcome.

ELIZA	Here's your payment.

FATIMA	Thank you.

ELIZA	And do you think I can use your phone to make a ...

FATIMA		No, no, no, no, no. This telephone only receives calls. Let's go, babe.

RECEPCIONISTA	Aqui oh, usa o meu, mas liga a cobrar que "tá" (está) sem crédito. Look here, use my phone. But you'll have to call collect, okay? I don't have credit.

ELIZA	Thank you.

ELIZA	Eliza, calling from Rio de Janeiro.

GILDA		I'll take the call. I'll take the call. Eliza, daughter! How are you? What? How did you get to Rio de Janeiro?

ELIZA	I hitchhiked, mom.

GILDA	Ah! But I told you to take the bus, Eliza.

GILDA (off)	Are you okay?

ELIZA		Yes, I am well. I've already found a place to stay. A pension. But tell me, how's Dino?

GILDA	Dino is getting some tests done...

GILDA (off)	… at the hospital. But it looks like he'll be okay.

ELIZA	“Only the good die young,” right?

GILDA		Don't talk like that. Something way worse could have happened.

GILDA (off)	But he is furious, Eliza. 

GILDA	You won't be able to come home anytime soon.

ELIZA	Who said I wanted to come back?

GILDA	You don't mean that.

GILDA (off)	I think it's best if you stay there for now.

ELIZA	(reaction)

GILDA (off)	You'll be alright.

ELIZA		Yeah, I will. This place looks, look good. And the money you gave me is more than enough.

GILDA	Good. Take care, okay? Send me news.

ELIZA		Kisses. Send my love to Dayse and to Carlinhos, okay?

GILDA	Kisses. (cries) Love you, my daughter.


ELIZA	Bye.

ELIZA	Ah.

FATIMA	Ah.

ELIZA	Thank you. No problem.

FATIMA	You...

ELIZA	My room is, is upstairs, right?
	
FATIMA	Wait a minute. Listen up, girl. Hide your money, okay? There are lots of oportunistic theives around here, okay?

ELIZA	Okay. 

FATIMA	Good. Just go up these stairs.

FATIMA	You can tell me. What's up?

GILDA	Dino, dino, is everything okay? How are you?

DINO		I'm, I'm doing well. But when I put hands on your daughter... Where is she?

GILDA	(reaction)

DINO	Has she sent news already?

GILDA	No,  not yet.

DINO		Really? I should have called the sheriff Peçanha, to go after her.

GILDA	Oh, shush! (silence) calm down, calm down.

DINO	She tried to kill me.

GILDA		Oh, Dino! Do you really think a girl that size would pick a fight with a man your size?

DINO	Don't you believe me, woman?

GILDA		Calm down, calm down. Let's not fight, Dino. I am here anxiously waiting for you, I wasn't even able to open the bar. That's how worried I was. Let me, let me see how they did your stitching.

DINO	It itches.

ELIZA	Yeah, there is no going back now.

MAX	(eating)

LU	I'm glad everything worked out.

CAROLINA	I want you to go to my desk...

CAROLINA	… There are a few magazines on top of  it. Take a picture of each one of those covers and send them to me. I think there is a picture that would be great as a reference for my moodboard.

LU	What?

CAROLINA (off)	Do I need to repeat myself?

CAROLINA		Take a picture of the magazine covers and send them to me.

LU		I'm not at the office today, Carol. It's, it's Saturday night here...

CAROLINA		It's Sunday here, and I am working, too, honey. If I get to my location and I don't find these pictures in my e-mails...

LU		Okay, I'll get it done. I'm going to the office right now.

CAROLINA	Great.

MAX		I can't believe it, you're going to work now? Love, Carol takes advantage of you. And what makes it worse is you allow that to happen, and you like it. 

LU		Well, it's better for me to keep occupied, Max. Rafael isn't going to call me anyway, right?

MAX		He won't. Accept it and it'll hurt less, okay? It's better. 

HOMEM 1	(laughs)

PEÇANHA		(laughs) I thougt we weren't going to play pool today, yo. You're only opening the bar at night.

DINO		Ah! I only close this bar on Christmas and Memorial Day. You know that.

PEÇANHA	Hmm...

DINO	So, are we going to play?

PEÇANHA	(laughs)

HOMEM 1	Woah, woah, I'm in.

DINO	Let's go.

HOMEM 1		But look, I'm betting a lot, and I wanna see if you can keep up, fool.

DINO	I can't believe this. Where is my money? Gilda!

GILDA	What is it, love?

DINO	Gilda, someone took all the money from the register. It was that nasty daughter of yours, wasn't it? She tried to kill me so that she could steal from me. But I'm not just going to take it, okay? I am going to get the cops to look for her. I am only going to sleep well once she is behind bars.

GILDA	Dino, don't be over dramatic, okay? When Eliza gets back, she will work until she pays you back.

DINO	I don't care.

GILDA	You... (reaction)

DINO	Sheriff, come here. 

PEÇANHA	What is it, Dino?

DINO	This is the story. The girl attacked me and then disapeared with all my money. Can she go to jail for that?

PEÇANHA	Yeah, that's attempt to murder, followed by theft.

DINO	I want this girl behind bars.

GILDA	Hey, Dino, stop! Stop it! Eliza is a kid.

DINO	She's not a kid. She is legal and knows exactly what she is doing. If you weren't able to teach her about respect, life will teach her, in jail.

CAROLINA	Ready, Pietro?

PIETRO		All ready, love. We only need the people to arrive, right? Look!

CAROLINA	Finally. (laughs)

ARTHUR		What a beautiful day to work, or in my case, to appreciate this beautiful scenary.

CAROLINA	(laughs) Good morning. (kiss)

ARTHUR	(kiss) What's going on?

GERMANO	So, is everything ready to go? Anything missing?

CAROLINA	All ready.

ARTHUR	Germano, were you able to go back to sleep? Insomnia is a horrible thing isn't it?

LILI	Insomnia, love, you? That's news to me.

GERMANO		It's the jet lag, the trip, I didn't want to bother you. (reaction)

CAROLINA	Yes, please, come in. Make yourselves comforable. Need help, Lili?

LILI	No.

GERMANO	Please. 

LILI	Thank you.

CAROLINA	Good morning, Germano, how are you?

GERMANO	Good morning.

PIETRO	Please.

CAROLINA	Can you, please, not provoke me? 

PIETRO	Listen, Arthur, is your model on her way?

CAROLINA	Yeah, is she?

ARTHUR	She's coming. 
 
DANIELE	Nothing like a good night of sleep and a spritz of Chanel Number 5 to make me feel refreshed. 

ARTHUR	You are look radiant. Let's go to White Haven? Don't worry, okay? I'm not the one steering this boat!

DANIELE	Funny. I shouldn't even forgive you, (reaction) but you look irrisistible. Isn't he cute, you guys? Just look at him.

CAROLINA	 “Aham”. 

DANIELE	Handsome. (kiss)

ARTHUR	I try.

PIETRO	He's a player!

CAROLINA	He is the player that is going to help me with this Bastille partnership.

PIETRO	Hopefully.

ARTHUR	Let's go.

ELIZA	Hm? Where's Fatima?

RECEPCIONISTA	She went to the market, quickly. She asked me to keep an eye on everything.

ELIZA	Oh. Understood.

RECEPCIONISTA	So, did you sleep the whole day?

ELIZA		Hm, I was exhausted. Come here, is there a place where I can get a sandwich or something cheap for me to eat?

RECEPCIONISTA	Go up this street for two blocks. You won't miss it.

ELIZA	 “Go up this street for to blocks,” okay. Thanks.

RECEPCIONISTA		Hey, you need to leave the keys here in the reception.

ELIZA	Uhhh. Really? Why? I'm the only one in my room.

RECEPCIONISTA	Rules are rules, love. I didn't invent them. What is it? Don't you trust me? If you don't, take the keys, and then deal with Fatima yourself when she gets back. You'll have to deal with her craziness, not me.

ELIZA	Here you go.

CAROLINA (vídeo)		This is Daniele Bidche's exclusive shoot using Bastille's make-up for TOTAL DREAMER in Australia. It's going to look great. Stay tuned.

LU	 
	Hello. Who?

RAFAEL	It's Rafael, the photographer...

RAFAEL		… who kidnapped you the other day and brought you to his studio. So, what are you doing right now? I'd love to see you!

LU	Wow, I'd loved to, but I can't. I am the only living soul at my magazine's office.

RAFAEL	You're at TOTAL DREAMER?

LU	Yes. But who knows, maybe tomorrow, or any other day, any other time. I have nothing planned.

RAFAEL	I was thinking about stopping by now. I would love to see the place where you live.

LU	Now? Here? You?

JONATAS	You can come in closer, okay? Yes. Even further, yes, yes! Hey, there, good evening. Did you find the pension?

ELIZA	It's none of your business.

JONATAS	No, wait, wait up, girl, wait! Why are you so stubborn?

ELIZA	Go away, boy. I don't want to talk to beggars.

JONATAS	Uh! Hey! I am not a beggar, okay? I am a street entrepreneur. It's different. During the day I sell candy at the light, at night I watch parked cars, yo!

ELIZA	Cool, yo! Now let me eat in peace, go!

JONATAS	Okay, especially because I have more important things to do. I am working, okay?

ELIZA	Working?

JONATAS	Yes, working, stubborn.

ATENDENTE	What do you want, girl?

ELIZA	I want one of these sandwiches, a coffee and a piece of that cake, please.

JONATAS	Thank you.

MOTORISTA	Valeu. 
Thanks.

JONATAS	Just turn the wheel and you're good to go. You're good, you're good. Parking spot! Parking spot! 

JACARÉ	Excuse me, my brother.

JONATAS	What is it, Jacare, that's my money, yo.

JACARÉ	This is for the money you lost me that day.

JONATAS	Me?

JACARÉ	You must have forgotten, Braço.

BRAÇO	(reaction) What is it?

JACARÉ	First, you don't share the money with me, then you don't let me keep that Valley Girl's phone. What's up, bro, do you want to fight?

JONATAS	You know what? You can keep that little money. You must need it more than I do. I am going to stop working anyway, since it's Saturday. So, free parking spot.

JACARÉ	Are you making fun of me? You aren't ever working again, you fool.

JONATAS	Let's go, Riscado, let's leave.  

RECEPCIONISTA	(reaction – Laughs) Game over, red neck. 

FATIMA		I thought I told you to take care of the pension while I went to the market.

RECEPCIONISTA	But I couldn't even pee? Gosh! 

FATIMA	No, you can't even pee!

RECEPCIONISTA	Let me help you?

FATIMA	It's okay. I'll go alone. No need to help me (reaction). 

RECEPCIONISTA	Stop being stubborn, woman.

FATIMA	It's okay.

RECEPCIONISTA	I'll help you put things away.

FATIMA	No need to.

PIETRO	Carol, love, can you find my hat? Please?

CAROLINA	Yes, of course.

PIETRO	It should be over there.

CAROLINA	Uhum.

PIETRO	I am toasting over here.

CAROLINA	Looks great.

PIETRO	Yes!

CAROLINA	Looks pretty.

GERMANO	Very pretty.

CAROLINA	Oh, Dani...

PIETRO	Lights and...

CAROLINA	… She can look even better in pictures.

GERMANO	I'm not talking about her.

PIETRO	Saulo, love.

CAROLINA	Germano, Germano, I like compliments, but your wife is right there and I don't want any trouble for us.

GERMANO	No, but there shouldn't be a problem. It looks like your friend is keep her entertained.

PIETRO	Thank you.

GERMANO	Too entertained, right?

ARTHUR	Care for a little more?

LILI	Thank you.

CAROLINA	Arthur?

GERMANO	Yes.

CAROLINA	Don't worry about Arthur. He's not a threat. Pietro. 

PIETRO	Yes?

CAROLINA	Germano is worried about Lili being in that sun shack with Arthur, can you believe it?

ARTHUR	Here you go.

LILI	Thank you.

ARTHUR	Oh, this breeze, this place, I could live here.

PIETRO	Germano, Arthur is gay (laughs)

GERMANO	Ah!

PIETRO	Totally gay.

GERMANO	I knew it.

CAROLINA	(laughs)

GERMANO	(laugh) That's why he wanted me to go up to his room with me last night. He was...

CAROLINA	Uh.

PIETRO	Oh 

GERMANO	He recites poetry all the time.

PIETRO E CAROLINA	(laughs)

GERMANO	He does these things. I got out of it easily, did I?

TODOS	(laughs)

CAROLINA	See, no need to be worried.

ARTHUR	What about you, are you having fun?

LILI	I haven't allowed myself to have fun in awhile (laughs).

ARTHUR	(laughs) Because of your daughter's death? It was an accident, right? You had said. How old was she? (reaction). Sorry for being rude. Let's talk about something eles.

LILI	No, no, no.

ARTHUR	Sorry.

LILI	No, no, no, no, no. Talking about Sofia is a way to keep her alive, isn't it? She was so young. She had her whole life ahead of her.

SOFIA	To us!

LILI (off)	It was New Years Eve, two years ago. I told them to stay at home, but she insisted in going to a party with her boyfriend, and I allowed her to go.

RAFAEL	Sofia.

SOFIA		Come see the fireworks, Rafa. (laughs – kisses) I love you.

RAFAEL	I love you, too. (kiss)

SOFIA	Yay!

RAFAEL	Happy New Year!

SOFIA	Happy New Year!

AMBOS	(laughs)

LILI (off)	I never saw Rafael again. They said he left the country after the accident.

SOFIA	 (kisses)

LILI (off)	She died that same night. And part of me died that night, too.

LILI	I always feel guilty about not telling her to stay.

ARTHUR	Yes, but how could you have known? It was an accident. You even said it.

LILI	No mom deserves to see a daughter die. Especially so young.

ARTHUR	Yes.

LILI		After that night I stopped working. Germano took over Bastille. I stopped going to the country club, stopped going to parties, and secluded myself from the world. Until this trip. (reaction) And I confess, the only reason I came here was because I was jealous of the oh-so-famous Carolina.

ARTHUR	(laughs)

LILI	But this place, this place is magical. So... Ah, and you,  you are extremely nice to me.

ARTHUR	Don't worry about it.

LILI	I feel lighter.

ARTHUR	(laughs)

LILI	Thank you.

ARTHUR	(kiss) I am glad.

GERMANO	Are you sure he is gay?

CAROLINA	Totally gay.

GERMANO	Really?

PIETRO	Hey, love, come look. I think we've got it, huh? Right?

CAROLINA	Do you like this one?

PIETRO		If it's up to me, we can move on to the underwater pics. Yes?

CAROLINA	Okay, let's go you guys! We've got the picture.

RAFAEL	So this office belongs to...

LU	Not here, for the Love of God.

RAFAEL	… the all powerful...

LU	No!

RAFAEL	… Carolina Castilho, right?

LU	The books, oh my...

RAFAEL	Hum?

LU	… Gosh. (kiss) Stop. (kiss)

RAFAEL	Why?

LU	If anything changes place, she will notice...

RAFAEL	Hey, Lu...

LU	… and she wil kill me.

RAFAEL	… calm down, calm down, relax, okay?

LU	(reaction)

RAFAEL		We'll clean up afterwards. I have a really good memory, okay? (kiss) No need to worry. (kiss)

LU	(reaction – kiss) Stop it, please, stop, stop, stop...

RAFAEL	(reaction - kiss)

LU	Stop, Rafa, not in here. 

RAFAEL	(kiss) Why not?

LU	Not here.

RAFAEL	Why not?

LU	Stop. (reaction – laughs – kiss) Stop, please. 

RAFAEL	Hm? 

LU	Stop. 

RAFAEL	Hm? 

LU	I am, I'm asking. (kiss) Stop. (kiss) Continue. 

RAFAEL	Uhum.

LU	Continue. 

RAFAEL	(kiss) Uhum. (kiss)

LU	(reaction)

LU	What is this? 

RAFAEL	What?

LU	A scar? Wow, I hadn't noticed that last time.

LU	What is it? Does it still hurt?

RAFAEL	A lot. 

LU	What was it? Transplant?

RAFAEL	No, that was the day they removed my heart. But didn't you want to get out of here? Didn't you want to leave?

LU	No, I can't leave now. Only when Carol allows me to.

RAFAEL	Speaking of Carol, I, I saw the behind the scenes of the Australia shoot. Who's the photographer they are shooting with?

LU	He's an Australian photographer, Jess Miph. Do you know him?

RAFAEL	Uhum. Truthfully, do you know what I was thinking? I was thining that you could refer me to your boss, right? I would love to take pictures for TOTAL DREAMER.

LU	When she gets back.

RAFAEL	She's coming back?

LU	Uhum.

RAFAEL	Yes?

LU	Yes. Now come. (laughs) Come.

RAFAEL	Hmm...

LU	Come to my desk, come. It's too dangerous, over here.

RAFAEL	Really?

LU	Yes.

RAFAEL	Yes, you think?

LU	And it's more fun here, look.

RAFAEL	But it's more interesting.

LU	(laughs)

RAFAEL	Hold on, just a second, calm down.

LU	No.

RAFAEL	Just a second, just a second.

LU	No, let's go, let's leave.

RAFAEL	Calm down, calm down, calm down.

LU	… Oh my gosh.

RAFAEL	I'm pretty sure that this owl was over here. There. Perfect. I have a perfect memory. Cool.

LU	Thank you.

RAFAEL	(kiss) You're welcome. 

LU	(laughs – kiss) Come. (laughs - kiss)

JENIFFER	Stop.

WESLEY	Mommy's favorite is home.

WESLEY	Now we can eat. (laughs)

BOLA	Let's go, I am super hungry.

ROSÂNGELA	Is anyone else helping with the bills?

WESLEY	Ruined me.

ROSÂNGELA	Let's stop companing.

JENIFFER	I'm not saying anything.

ROSÂNGELA	And you also aren't doing anything, right?

JONATAS	Wow, give me your blessings, mom.

ROSÂNGELA	Get up from there.

ROSÂNGELA	Help me set the table. God bless you, my son.  

JONATAS	Amen. This chicken smells really good.

ROSÂNGELA	Don't be rude! That's not what I taught you. What is this? Go wash your hands!

JONATAS	Hm... good.

ROSÂNGELA	Ai Jonatas, I feel that my heart breaks because you spend the whole week so far away from me. And on top of that you work on Saturdays. What type of boss is he? Doesn't he have a mother?

JENIFFER	Excuse me.

ROSÂNGELA		I feel like going into your office and talking to your boss.

JONATAS	What are you talking about, mom?

ROSÂNGELA	Send it that way, honey.

JONATAS	The dude is a good guy, mom.

WESLEY	(reaction)

JONATAS	This week he even gave me dollars. Look. 

ROSÂNGELA	Wow!

JENIFFER	That's the catch 22 

BOLA	Good.

ROSÂNGELA	No way, Jonatas.

JONATAS	Give me that.

ROSÂNGELA	What is this?

JONATAS	Give that back to me.

JENIFFER	Give me that.

ROSÂNGELA	You guys, you are going to rip the bill.

WESLEY	Ah...

JENIFFER	(laughs)

WESLEY	Let's eat?

JENIFFER	Look.

WESLEY	Let's eat, let's eat, for the love of God? Mom, your son needs some refueling, right? 

ROSÂNGELA	Yes, you're right, son.

JONATAS	Yes. Listen up, aren't you going to stop growing?

WESLEY	 (reaction)

JONATAS	You don't even look like the youngest brother.

ROSÂNGELA	Well, he only thinks about eating and playing soccer, that one.

WESLEY		Yes, but one day I am going to be a professional soccer player, right mom? Everyone will scream: “Wesley, Wesley"

JONATAS	(Laughs)

ROSÂNGELA	But without an education you won't be anything.

JENIFFER	Yes.

WESLEY	Hm. 

ROSÂNGELA	Let's go, you guys, let's eat. Jonatas must be hungry right? 

BOLA	Just a tad.

JENIFFER	Hm.

ROSÂNGELA	You work a lot don't you? Wow.

JONATAS	Yes, it's a lot of work, mom. Making copies, giving it to the clients... Thigngs like that. Typical of law offices...

ROSÂNGELA	At least he pays well and on time, right? But you could get a job closer to home, couldn't you? So that you can stop crashing at friend's sofas?

JONATAS	Mom, we've already discussed this. Let's focus on the food because it's going to get cold, right?

JENIFFER	The food.

ROSÂNGELA	You're right. Come here, come here.

JENIFFER	Hold on mom.

ROSÂNGELA		Does anyone over at your friend's Carlitos house cook better than me? Tell me the truth.

JONATAS	Ah! You know that's impossible, right?

ROSÂNGELA	Oh boy!

TODOS	(reaction)

FATIMA	Hey girl! Did you walk all over town?

ELIZA	Not yet, I was just having a snack.

FATIMA	So, do you plan on spending another night?

ELIZA	Uhum, yes, why?

FATIMA	Great. Payment in advance to guarantee your spot, please.

ELIZA	Okay, I'm going to get it.

FATIMA	Thanks.

ELIZA	Oh, no! I can't believe it.

ELIZA	Where is my money, you thief?

RECEPCIONISTA	What are you acusing me of, you red neck?

ELIZA	Theif. Give me my money back, you thief. I know you got it when I turned in my key, right?

FATIMA	What are you talking about, can you tell me?

ELIZA	Give it back...

RECEPCIONISTA	Hey.

ELIZA	...Give it back to me

FATIMA	What's happening?

ELIZA	You're going to give me my money back.

RECEPCIONISTA	How long have you known me for, Fatima? That's her coming up with excuses for her not to pay the bill.

ELIZA	You liar. She stole from me, she stole my money.

RECEPCIONISTA	Touch me again and I will break you, understand?

ELIZA	Oh really? I'll knock your stupid face out, girl.

FATIMA	Woah, woah!

RECEPCIONISTA	She's crazy, I'm calling the police.

ELIZA	Call them. You liar, I'm going to get you. 

FATIMA	Stop it!

RECEPCIONISTA	Troublemaker.

FATIMA	Stop it! It's a she said, she said situation. If you can't pay, grab your stuff tomorrow and leave. This isn't a charity place. That's it.

ELIZA	I'm not leaving. I want my money back. Call the police. I'm not leaving.

RECEPCIONISTA	(reaction)

ELIZA	Call them.

ELIZA	Let go of me, let go of me. I didn't do anything, I promise.

POLICIAL	Girl, no one here wants touble.

FATIMA	Go, go.

POLICIAL	Either you leave peacefully...

FATIMA	Go.

POLICIAL	… Or we will force you to leave.

ELIZA	This isn't fair...

FATIMA	Go. It's fair...

ELIZA	Can you at least give me the money I had given you, please?

FATIMA	It's fair, young lady. Life isn't fair. You slept here, só you need to pay. Go.

RECEPCIONISTA	Dumb red neck.

FATIMA	Leave.

ELIZA	Are you both on this scheme?

FATIMA	Ah! Go! Go now!

ELIZA	It's obvious.

FATIMA	Yes, leave, go! We are in this together.

ELIZA	Nasty women!

POLICIAL	Calm down.

FATIMA	Go end that...
	
POLICIAL 	Let's go. 

ELIZA	Let go of me! Let go of me...

FATIMA	Go quickly.

ELIZA	… I know how to walk by myself, okay?

POLICIAL	Go your own way, go.

FATIMA	Leaving a little too late (reaction)

POLICIAL	Go, let's leave. Go, go.

RECEPCIONISTA	Forget this girl.

FATIMA	No.

POLICIAL	Let's go. The show is over. Everyone back to normal.

FATIMA	No.

POLICIAL	Show's over. Get her, get her!

FATIMA	Go, get her!

RECEPCIONISTA	Get her, fast!

LILI	These pictures truly look great. Looking great, dear.

DANIELE	Thank you.

PIETRO	(kiss)

DANIELE	I loved them too.

CAROLINA	(chit chat) 

DANIELE	Jess is super creative, isn't he?

ARTHUR	Good job.

CAROLINA	Jess, thank you, man. I’m so glad you made it.

PIETRO	But Bastille also killed it, hm? The makeup didn't even smudge underwater. 

GERMANO	Did you doubt us? Our product is top quality.

CAROLINA	(laughs) I am sure this campaign is going to be a success. It's the beginning of a beautiful partnership.

GERMANO	Yeah, who knows, right, love?

ARTHUR	For sure, TOTAL DREAMER and Bastille go hand in had, right? Just don't forget to hire my models.

LILI	I will make sure that happens.

LILI	Let's go, love? Today was an exhausting day. (laughs)

GERMANO	You're tired? So let's go.

PIETRO	Well, the boart is already ready to go.

CAROLINA	What a surprise...

PIETRO	Whoever wants to stay...

CAROLINA	(chit chat)

PIETRO	… It can come back to pick you guys up after.

DANIELE	Okay, great!

PIETRO	Okay?

CAROLINA	(Chit chat)

DANIELE		So, Arthur, want to stay at the beach? We've already made up...

CAROLINA	Yes.

ARTHUR	I can't right now. But come here, congratulations on the pictures, congratulations. I am going to talk business with Carol, I'll stay behind for a little bit.

DANIELE	Hm... Business here? Hmm... Well, if you change your mind, stop by my room later. Business then pleasure. 

CAROLINA	Thank you. It was a pleasure!

JESS	My pleasure, thank you.

ARTHUR	Good job.

JESS	Thank you.

ARTHUR	Thank you.

JESS	It was a pleasure working with you.

LILI	Pietro, do Arthur and Carolina have a thing?

GERMANO	No, the dude is gay.

LILI	Are you sure? Him?

GERMANO	Yes.

PIETRO	Positively. (laughs) Truthfully Arthur and Carol are childhood friends, get it? Practically BFFs.

LILI	(reaction) Well, now I know why he is such a gentleman.

ROSÂNGELA	Can you tell me where you are going this late, young lady?

JENIFFER	Well, I am going to the club right next to us. Is that a problem?

ROSÂNGELA	The problem is that you aren't going alone.

BOLA	Oh! I'll go with her.

ROSÂNGELA	Ha! Is that a joke? That's even worse! You are a minor.

WESLEY	You're right mom. Don't let them go. This club only has “predators” ready for some fesh meat. Just like Jeni.

JENIFFER	They are all your friends.

ROSÂNGELA	(reaction)

WESLEY	And that exactly why you can't go, I know all of those players really well.

JONATAS	I'll take her, mom. Who knows I might run into an old friend of mine, right?

WESLEY	Well, mom, if Jonatas is going, I'm going to, okay?

ROSÂNGELA 	Well, if Jonatas is going, you can go, too. But, be careful, okay? Because that club always ends in confusion, son.

JONATAS	Relax, I'll take care of all of these kids.

WESLEY	(laughs) Ah okay, take care of all the kids.

BOLA	(laughs) Kids?!

ARTHUR	This moon and this brandy, touches me like the Devil.

CAROLINA	What moon? What brandy?

ARTHUR	(laughs)

CAROLINA	(laughs) Okay, are you talking about the sun? (laughs)

ARTHUR	Actually that is a verse by Drummond, but it has a lot to do with how I feel now.It's so good, so good to be only the two of us here. Without that businessman hitting on you, without me having to flirt with his wife.

CAROLINA	(laughs) Yeah, I know.

ARTHUR	(laughs)

CAROLINA	But this is only happening during the trip. I need to become partners with them for the magazine. It's important to me.

ARTHUR	Okay, but let's forget about the magazine for a little, okay? Let's live in the moment.

CAROLINA	Very good.

ARTHUR	Hmm... 

CAROLINA	Very. Too bad that as soon as we leave here, the moment is over, the magic is over. I go back to being a successful professional and you a player.

ARTHUR	Really? Why doesn't this happen: You go back to being a cruel and cold professional, and I, a hopeless romantic that you love to deny, mistreat and ignore, right?

CAROLINA	Poor thing. Frankly, how long have we known each other?

ARTHUR	I am not rude, I am not going to reveal your age.

ARTHUR	A gentleman.

CAROLINA	Don't talk to me about being a hopeless romantic...

ARTHUR	(laughs)

CAROLINA	… No, you are a player, you've gone out with all of my friends and enemies, which is even worse.
	
ARTHUR	I would exchange all of them for you.

CAROLINA	You would exchange all of them, hm? Have you ever thought what would have happened if we had gone all the way to the end?

ARTHUR	Define “going all the way”?

CAROLINA	If we had gotten married, had kids.

ARTHUR	I've been married, it was a mistake, I have a daughter who... (reaction) I have a daughter who hates me. What we have is special. You are special. You are captivating. If it gets any better it gets ruined. (kiss) Do you want to swim before going back, hm? Want to? Do you want to bet that the water is warm? Whoever wins, gets a great Australian wine, hm?

CAROLINA	(laughs) No, I prefer you.

ARTHUR	Let's go, are you going to miss out on this opportunity?

CAROLINA	I know what would have happened if we had gone all the way. One day, while drinking coffee and reading the newspaper, you would notice that I am not all that special.

ARTHUR	Come, this is too good. It's really warm. I want my australian wine, okay?

CAROLINA	No, I didn't bet anything.

PEÇANHA	(laughs) Dino, I asked around town but no one knows of Eliza's whereabouts.

DINO	The money is going to end and she'll be back, then you'll get her, hm? She needs to pay for what she has done to me.

GILDA	Hello.

ELIZA	Mom.

GILDA	Eliza.

ELIZA	Mom, they stole all the money that I had on me. I don't know what to do.

GILDA	Oh, my goodness. But what now? What's going to happen?

ELIZA		I don't know. They've kicked me out of the pension.

GILDA (off)	What?

GILDA		Oh Eliza. And right now is not a good time for you to come back.

ELIZA	Why don't we just tell the truth to the police, hm? We'll tell them the Dino tried to grab me and I just defended myself. He's the one that's wrong, mom. 

GILDA (off)	Oh, my love....

GILDA	… Who's going to believe in a girl like you?

DINO	It's her, isn't it?

GILDA	(reaction)

DINO	Give me this phone.

GILDA	Oh, Dino.

DINO	Eliza, you nasty girl!

GILDA	Dino.

DINO	I'm going to get you for everything you've done to me, understand?

GILDA	Dino.

DINO	Hm? Are you hearing me? Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

DINO (off)		And to hurt me, the father of your own brothers? And you still take the money?

GILDA	Dino, give me the phone.
	
DINO	You'll pay for this.

GILDA	Stop, Dino.

DINO	Hm? I'm going to get you. I already have Peçanha looking for you.

GILDA	Dino, we don't want to fight, please, no.  

CAROLINA	(laughs) Arthur, why didn't we ever try? 

ARTHUR	What do you mean?

CAROLINA	Really try, I mean.

ARTHUR	This, here, isn't true?

CAROLINA	You know what I mean.

ARTHUR	This crazy relationship is the longest relationship I have ever had. 

CAROLINA	Me too, and that's the problem.

ARTHUR	Why complicate? Come here. (kiss).

GERMANO		If I didn't know that you are gay, I would think that you are flirting with my wife.

DANIELE	Gay? Arthur? (laughs) You guys don't know anything, right, Carol?

CAROLINA	(Laughs) Yes.

ARTHUR	Who said I was gay, Germano? I mean, nothing against it, but it's not what I'm into...

GILDA	I can't stand hearing you talk about putting her in jail.

DINO	You're not the one with the cracked head. You're not the one she stole from.

GILDA	What? She barely stole anything? Forget  Eliza, Dino, (cries) think about your family, Dino, think about your kids, your wife. That's what's important now.

GERMANO	What are you willing to give me to be partners with my company?

CAROLINA	Are you serious?

GERMANO	What if I were?
