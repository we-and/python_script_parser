storyteller	<announcing title> three steam engines gruff. 
storyteller	it was autumn on sodor, the time of year when all the trees begin to lose their old leaves...
storyteller	thomas was working on his branch line with annie and clarabel. so were toby and henrietta.
toby	hello. thomas.
thomas	hello, toby...
toby	don't the trees look spooky without any leaves? 
henrietta	<laughs> oh, toby! why do you think so many things are spooky?
toby	but they are! sometimes they look like big hands reaching over the tracks to grab you and pick you up like a toy train!
thomas	<laughs> you do have a big imagination, toby! they're only trees!
toby	oh…hmm
storyteller	a little further along the line, thomas noticed that one of farmer mccoll's fences was broken.
thomas	oh dear.
clarabel	be careful, thomas! there could be a runaway animal on the track.
storyteller	thomas didn't see any animals on the tracks... but he did see trevor, the traction engine, working in a field!
trevor	hello, thomas!
thomas	hello, trevor! there's a broken fence by the track back there. 
trevor	oh! is there? i'll tell farmer mccoll. he'll want to get that repaired before an animal escapes.
storyteller	that night in the shed, thomas told percy about the broken fence...
percy	oooh! that sounds very spooky!
thomas	<laughs> don't you start! i've already had toby talking to me about the spooky trees!
percy	but think about it, thomas... who broke that fence? or what broke that fence? it could have been anything?!
.henry/james	<gasp>
henry	<frightened scream>
thomas	<giggles> it was probably just an animal... go to sleep, percy. 
gordon	i quite agree! go to sleep!
percy	(suddenly nervous) but i can't go to sleep... it's my job to pull the mail train!
storyteller	poor percy had frightened himself, but the other engines didn't really think there was anything to be frightened of... 
percy	<scared/stuttering> hello? is someone there?
percy	<screams>
percy	<wailing in fear>
gordon	<scared/shocked walla>
henry	help! oh my! oh my! help! help!
gordon	what is the matter with you, percy? racing in and bashing into henry in the middle of the night?!
percy	sorry... b-but... i heard something v-v-very spooky... out on thomas' branch line!
gordon	oh i've had quite enough of this spookiness! just deliver the mail and let the rest of us go back to sleep!
.percy	<walla>
storyteller	the next morning it was bright and sunny...
percy	...and then as i crossed over the little bridge by the watermill i heard this strange moaning sound... ooooooohhhhhhhh..... it was like nothing i've ever heard before, thomas! it was very very spooky!
thomas	well it's day time now and the sun is shining and i'm sure whatever it was will be long gone away!
toby	i hope so.
toby	i have to go over that bridge to take the workers to the quarry!
percy	(nervously) i have to go over that bridge today too!
thomas	so do i. we all have to go over that bridge! but i'm quite sure there's nothing to worry about. <laughs>
storyteller	thomas wasn’t worried at all as he travelled up the branch line with annie and clarabel
trevor	hello thomas! 
storyteller	but then he came to the bridge by the watermill...
annie	what's the matter, thomas?
clarabel	why are we slowing down? is there an animal on the line?
thomas	no. it's just... well... percy says he heard something spooky last night as he went over this bridge, but i'm sure there's nothing to...
thomas, annie & clarabel	<cries of alarm>
toby	d-did you hear it, thomas?
annie	do you mean that terrible moaning and groaning?
clarabel	under the bridge?
percy	it must be a troll!
thomas	a troll?
percy	trolls live under bridges. don't you remember the three billy goats gruff?
toby	percy’s right. it was a mean hungry troll that lived under the bridge and the three billy goats were all scared to cross over. they made the little one go first, and he survived by telling the troll to eat his bigger brother! 
toby	i'm going first!
percy	i'm going second!
henrietta 	calm down, toby! what are you racing for?!
percy	go on, toby!
thomas	we can't wait here forever!
annie 	i don't hear anything now. 
clarabel	maybe the troll's gone away again <screams>. 
henrietta 	there's probably nothing to worry about. i mean whatever it was has probably... <screams!>
toby	don't eat me! don't eat me! don't eat me!
percy	it's still here!
percy	don't eat me! don't eat me! don't eat me!
percy	 (shouting back to thomas) the third one has to be brave, thomas! the third one has to make the troll go away. 
thomas	(shouting to percy) what are you talking about, percy?
percy	(shouting to thomas) in the story... the third goat is the one who makes the troll go away and you're the third...
thomas	<gasp> <gulps>
percy	(shouting to thomas) oh, thomas! he's very hungry now! 
annie 	um... you know... clarabel. that doesn't sound like a troll to me.
clarabel	i do believe you're right, annie. it sounds more like... a cow!
thomas	a cow?
percy/toby	a cow?
cow	moooooooo!
.thomas	<laughs>
storyteller	one of farmer mccoll's cows had broken the fence and wandered down into the river, where it got stuck in the mud. 
storyteller	jem cole brought trevor, the traction engine, to help, and set up a winch to lift the stranded cow back up again. 
storyteller	and thomas carried the poor frightened animal back to the farm.
storyteller	that night in the sheds thomas, percy and toby told the other engines about their big adventure...
james	a cow!? <laughs> you were all frightened of a cow!

gordon/henry/edward	<laugh>

toby	it’s not that funny.
thomas	you can laugh, james! but farmer mccoll said he was very glad that we found it!
gordon	imagine thinking a cow was a troll!
james, gordon, henry, edward and emily	<laugh>
percy	it’s not funny! it was really scary.
thomas	well it’s a little a-moooo-sing <laughs>.
percy	<laughs>
gordon/james/henry/emily/toby/edward	<laugh>
