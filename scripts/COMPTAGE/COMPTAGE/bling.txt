oscar	oh, that stings!
oscar	oh, mamma.  no, no, no, no!
oscar	why is this so hard!
victor	sir, because you changed the code.
oscar	i did?
oscar	i just don't get it, victor. why's she mad at me?
oscar	was it too many balloons?
victor	why do you care so much about this woman?  is love that important?
oscar	what do you know about love?  you're just like the evil tin man.
victor	well, that's how you built me, sir.
oscar	then use that evil mind of yours to take my game to the next level.  she needs an offer she can't refuse.  something big, something threatening, something…
oscar	that's it! ah...the valentine's day parade!  of course.  it's perfect!
sue	broken glass, broken robots, and broken hearts mark super villain oscar return to form. this man is deranged, he is armed and dangerous, and any information on his possible whereabouts should be reported to the authorities immediately. all i can say is too little too late oscar. this is sue widdington, back to you.

wilmer	nose knows.
pedestrian #3	are they part of the parade?
sam	guys, stay alive i will bring your show back.
young sue	just pop the question.
sue	pop the question. pop the question. pop the question. pop the question. it's been twenty years.  how long do i have to wait?
sam	are you all right?
sue	i'm fine.  thank you.
sam	listen, sue, i've been meaning to ask you something.
sue	what is it, sam?
sam	sue...
sue	oh my gosh…
pedestrian #3	wow, look at the size of that ring!
sam	i... i...
sue	wait wait wait. what’s wrong, sam? what's wrong? is something the matter?
sam	...i-i can't do this.  i'm sorry, but, this isn't right.
people	what did he say?
sue	well. i mean that's how you really feel about it. look. i'm leaving the city after my broadcast today.
sam	leaving?  where?
sue	i accepted a job offer with a network in london. ok?
sam	london. but that’s so far away.
sue	well, i guess there's no use waiting for something that's never gonna happen, right?
sam	i...i...
sue	have a good life, sam.
sam	sue, please...
sue	goodbye..
victor	it must feel good, sir. to be a super villain again.
oscar	it does bring back fond memories. but it's only temporary, victor.
victor	of course. the wedding.
oscar	today is the happiest day of my life.
victor	with all due respect, sir, why would you want to give up everything for katherine?
oscar	i'm not giving up anything for her. actually, quite the opposite.  everything i have is because of her.
victor	i don't understand.
oscar	i've loved katherine for a very long time.  it's because of her that i became the man i am today. she told me to stay away from her, that i'd never measure up to her standards, so i had to love her from the far. she was so beautiful.
katherine	remember, if you want to marry a widdington, you have to be a great man, and great men only give a great ring.
oscar	i'll show you, katherine! i will become a great man!!
victor	so the only reason you became a super villain... was to impress katherine?
oscar	that's right.  so it's all thanks to her that you even exist. and with this ring she can make you not existed.
victor	master, wake up!  your sole purpose in life is to bring the world to its knees.  to live and breathe by the code of villainy!
oscar	victor, you're scaring me.
victor	and now you want to give up everything?!  well, i don't want that.  i want you to lead me again on some diabolical adventure of destruction and mayhem.  i want my oscar back!
oscar	driver, driver, stop the car!
oscar	get...out!!
victor	excuse me, what?  you're joking, right?
oscar	get out!
victor	i can't believe this!  after all i've done for you!!
victor	what do we have here. naughty, naughty.
old lady	son of…
victor	we really should stop meeting like this.
sam	he..here...take it.
victor	ha… i can't believe my luck.
sam	what was that for?
victor	for giving me the greatest gift in the world.
sam	oh my god!!
victor	i'll see you later, boy.
sam	sue…. sue…
katherine	all right, sue, i've got three minutes before i have to give a big speech.  so let's do this interview fast.
sue	yeah. sure.
katherine	you okay?
sue	couldn't be better.
sue	well, mayor, it looks like the valentine's day parade is turning out to be a big success.
katherine	indeed it is, sue... and i just want to thank everyone...
oscar	katherine, my love.
katherine	well.. not everyone...securities!  stop him!
oscar	katherine, please.  can't you listen to me just this once?
katherine	please, why should i do that?
oscar	because you'll regret it if you don't.
katherine	what are you talking about, oscar?
oscar	i'm talking about this. what!! what the -- ?! this isn't my ring.
katherine	securities!!
oscar	b-but katherine.  please. victor, you brought me the wrong ring!
victor	oh, i'm sorry.  you mean this ring?
katherine	what are you up to this time?
oscar	if you don't accept this ring, the great oscar robot will destroy the city.
oscar	victor, give the ring. 
oscar	victor, are you crazy?  what do you think you're doing?
victor	i'm doing what you built me to do, sir.  i'm being evil.
oscar	you moron!  give that back to me before i melt you down for scrap metals.
victor	first, let me polish it for you.
oscar	what are you doing?
victor	oops. i guess diamonds aren't forever.
oscar	my ring!  my ring!
victor	attention, citizens... from now on, valentine's day will be known as the day that i, victor, destroyed your city forever.
oscar	fire!  fire!  fire!
katherine	oscar, you tell me, right now. how do we stop that thing???
oscar	it was supposed to be a beautiful celebration.
katherine	the robot, oscar.  how do we turn it off?
oscar	you can't turn it off.  victor smashed the ring...but if you stop victor you can stop the robot, because they're connected to the same motion control system.
sue	follow me.  i got an idea.
katherine	sue, where are you going?
sue	wow
people	yeah!
sue	jack, start rolling.
news anchor	breaking news.  chaos erupts down at theme park.  channel 7's own sue widdington is live at the scene.
sam	sue?
sue	just minutes ago, a.. a.. a giant robot burst onto the scene, he is destroying everything in his path.  if this is not stop soon, the whole city may be in jeopardy…
sam	sue, look out!
sue	is there no one out there who can stop this madness?  please, somebody!!
sue	how long do i have to wait?
katherine	great men only give great rings.
sam	no katherine.  it's not about the ring.  it's about me.
sue	all right everyone, we have just learned that oscar's second in command, victor, is… he is operating the robot using some sort of motion control system. oh no. oh no. the robot's heading for the city. millions of lives could be at stake.  this is horrible, somebody please. it looks like no one can stop it.
victor	oh, this is so fun.
sam	sue!!
victor	eliminated naughty, naughty.
sam	sue, let's go.  we gotta get outa here. i can handle this sue, wait!
sue	wait?  ha! i'm done waiting, it's been twenty years.
sam	okay, i deserved that. i should have ask you before, you're right, but.
sue	but what?
sam	i wanted it to be great, you know. huh? sue, look out!!!
sam	listen, i know this isn't the best time, but this might be the last chance i ever get to say this. i know i've messed up every time i've tried to ask you. but.. i was… i was afraid. i was nervous. i always thought i needed to give you some huge, dramatic proposal with some huge ring. but that's not gonna happen, because that's not me. sue, i love you more than life itself. so i guess there's nothing else to say but... sue widdington……
victor	that is just so pathetic.
sam	will you... sue!!!
sue	aghhhh!  sam!
sam	ugh, not again.
victor	all this love is making me sick.  from now on we celebrate st. victor's day -- with total destruction for everyone.
