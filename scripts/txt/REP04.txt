(THE REPUBLIC 4)

		
			
			
			
Thabang 	I want to know who your leader is. Who is it?	
	
Young Dog	Moses Matseke, my bra.	
	
Thabang 	Moses Matseke?
		
Young Dog	Moses Matseke, yes.	
	
Deputy President 	Before we continue, I need to speak to President Mulaudzi.	
	
President Mulaudzi	Listen, Cassius. Don't give them the money! Don't…	
	
Moses	You have your proof.	 Bring the money. Now!
		
Thabang 	Can you hear me, Katlego? You won't believe who I found in Matseke's shack. Junior Zondo.	 This whole protest is a setup. Former President, Zondo, is the one behind all this mess.
		
Deputy President 	Where did you get that information?	
	
Katlego 	We have a man on the ground.
		
Junior	Moses, it's Junior.	 Thabang Ranaka is here in Soshanguve.	
	
Moses	Put the gun down!	
	
Bridget 	Do as he says, Thabang.		

Moses	Or I'll knock her head off.		

Thabang 	Bridge!
		
Bridget 	Hello, baby.
		
Junior 	I'm here with Gladys and your daughter, Dineo.
		
Bridget 	He says he has your	
	
Junior 	mother and Dineo.
		
Bridget 	If you don't stop what you're doing, he'll kill them.		
		
Moses	So...tell me...what's it going to be? Your daughter...or your heroism? Put the gun down.
		
Thabang 	Don't believe anything Matseke says. This fight has nothing to do with justice.	 You're not fighting for the community. The community will never see a cent of the money.	 They're going to fill their pockets with it and flee.	
	
Moses 	You're such a smooth talker, boy. I'm touched. Are you done?
		
Thabang 	Tell them the truth.	 Tell them that Zondo is the brains behind this mission. Tell them now!
		
Moses 	Get lost!
		
Thabang 	Don't tell me to get lost.	 Oh, you didn't know? Huh?
		
Karabo	Hey you, fool!	 You think we're doing all of this for justice? We're in this for the money!	 Everyone here gets a million, and fill their pockets.	
	
Thabang 	Stop dreaming about a million. What if it's an empty promise? You can't guarantee it's true.	
	
Karabo	Tell that to the fools out there! You should consider yourself lucky to be in the presence of future millionaires. Say what you want, but we're going to be rich. Right, Dogs?
		
Bridget 	Thabang. Thabang, put the gun down.	 Or they'll kill Dineo. Is that what you want?	 Put the gun down before they kill our daughter, man! Put the gun down!
		
Moses	So what's it going to be, dog? Are you going to be a good father...or play a hero?
		
Bridget 	Put the gun down before they kill our daughter! Drop it!
		
Moses	Listen to your woman.	 Put the gun down. Argh, shame. The enemy is neutralised. Keep the kid on ice. These two...we might put them to good use later. Take this dog to the freezer.	
	
Bridget 	You're hurting me, man!	
	
News Reporter  	We're still coming live from Soshanguve, just outside Pretoria, in Gauteng.		
Gladys	You're one hell of a coward! How does a boy your age...take an old woman like me and a teenage girl hostage? Your father was our country's President.	 Where is your loyalty to the country?	
	
Junior 	Haven't you heard, Gogo? Those who live in glass houses...should never throw stones.	
	
Gladys	I have nothing to be ashamed of.
		
Junior 	You see that beloved son of yours, has done worse while working for my father.	 So if I were you, old hag, I'd keep my wrinkled mouth shut.
		
Gladys	This thing is ill-mannered!
		
Deputy President 	Sir...
			
Minister of Finance 	if what you want to tell me is important, let's share it with the rest of the cabinet.
		
Deputy President 	Listen, the information I'm about to share with you is highly classified. Am I clear? Highly classified.	 This crisis we're facing...	
	
Minister of Finance 	uhm...
		
Deputy President 	has been staged. It's a front.	
	
Minister of Finance 	What are you talking about?	
	
Deputy President 	We both saw what's on TV. The riots has nothing to do with service delivery and corruption. It's about theft.
		
Minister of Finance 	It's about theft? Who is stealing what?
		
Deputy President 	R1.2 billion is being stolen.- R1.2 billion? - Yes.	
	
Minister of Finance 	Deputy, where did you get such information? Please, let's discuss this with other Ministers…
		
Deputy President 	I received this information from a reliable source. Okay? And he told me that in the cabinet, there is…there's a mole.
		
Minister of Finance 	A mole? Who is it?
		
Deputy President 	I don't know. Look,	 I think it's the Minister of Police.
		
Minister of Finance 	Victor? Never! Never, never, never!
		
Dog 	Hey, move! Walk, man!
		
Karabo	Get in!
		
Dog 	This guy is stubborn.
		
Karabo	Get in, man!
		
Dog 	Hey, get lost!
		
Karabo	What do we do now?	 Our cover is blown. The police now know our location. We have the same goal, right?
		
Moses	Of course. But like a springbok, we need to keep moving.
		
Karabo	Just say the word, and it shall be done.
		
Moses	We need to add a bit of spice.	 The satellite feed is on us. We need to move Madam President.	 Madam President, welcome to the pack. Put a mask on her.	 This is our only chance. We need to move fast. Change of plan.
		
Katlego 	What?
		
Bridget 	Are you crazy, Thabang?	 Huh? How could you leave the child alone? What were you thinking? How could you do this? Our daughter is held at gunpoint right now!	
	
Thabang 	Are you saying this is all my fault? Do you think I planned...to wake up and put our daughter's life in danger?
		
Bridget 	You know what, I would drop the sarcasm. It won't get us anywhere.
		
Thabang 	Your finger-pointing won't get us anywhere either. What finger-pointing? Huh?
		
Bridget 	What did I say when I left Dineo by your place? Didn't I say look after her?	
	
Thabang 	Okay, Bridge. I'm sorry.	 I didn't know things would turn out like this. I was just trying to save your life and the President's life.
		
Bridget	What about Dineo's life? Did you ever consider it?	
	
Thabang 	She was crying,	 nonstop, watching you being kidnapped live on television. She was crying. What was I supposed to do?	
	
Bridget	Don't you dare!	 Don't you dare put the blame on the child! You're supposed to be the adult. She's just a child. She's 16, Thabang! You were supposed to take care of the child!	 All this time, I handled everything those men threw at me,	 because my daughter was safe with her father. And now?
		
Thabang 	You need to remain positive, Bridge.	
	
Bridget 	Don't you dare tell me I have to be positive! I wouldn't have to use positive thinking…if you'd been a good father! You were supposed to be with her, Thabang!	 Instead, you chose to play the hero of Soshanguve.	
	
Thabang 	There's no point!	 There's no point getting upset about it. We should be figuring a way out of here.	
	
Bridget 	We wouldn't have to figure that out if you were a responsible father!		
Thabang 	Oh, well. How nice!	 We're in a crisis and you decide to lecture me about parental skills!
		
Bridget 	Well, somebody has to, sir. Just accept it. You failed her!	
	
Thabang 	This whole mess is not my fault, man!	 I didn't instruct anyone to kidnap the President!	 The only crime I'm guilty of, was doing what I thought was right! What was wrong!	
	
Bridget 	You're wrong, Thabang!	 Why can't you take responsibility, just once in your life?
		
Thabang 	Well, I just thought I did.	
	
Bridget 	Do you know when	
	
Thabang 	our problems started?
		
Bridget 	When you got involved with Hendrik's cronies. The day you agreed to do his dirty work,	 was the day you allowed him to corrupt the entire country. And not once...	not once did you bother to tell your wife. Look at us now. We're stuck in this freezer that we may never get out of alive. And where's our daughter? Where is she?	 What if those dogs rape her?	
	
Thabang 	Don't be scared. Didi is strong. She's strong like you. We will be fine. You'll see.
		
Junior	Just look at those idiots.	 Look.	 They'll never see a cent of that money.
		
Dineo 	How do you know?
		
Junior	Do you know who I am?	
	
Dineo 	I do know you.	 You and your father steal people's money. You think we don't know. you think...
		
Junior	 Hey, you. You're full of nonsense.	
	
Gladys 	 Leave my child alone!	
	
Junior	 Get lost, Gogo.
		
Gladys 	 Leave her alone! Don't argue with him.
		
Junior	 I'll blow your brains out. Shut up. Come here. Hey, come here!		
Junior	Come here.
		
Gladys 	 Dineo!
		
Junior	 Gogo, behave yourself.	
	
Gladys 	Don't argue with him.
		
Junior	Sit down. This is between me and Dineo. You call a spade a spade, sweetheart.	 I must look exactly like your father.	
	
Dineo 	Don't talk about my father!	
	
Junior	Your precious father...is just like me. He's just like my father. We're not different. We steal and lie for a living.
		
Dineo 	No! My dad confessed.	 Unlike your father!
		
Junior	 Gogo.
		
Gladys 	 Dineo, don't listen to him, he's lying.
		
Junior	 I said sit down. I don't remember your father...admitting to having an affair with my sister.	 I must have missed that.	
	
Gladys 	Dineo, he's lying! That boy is a liar!
		
Junior	Oh. You didn't know?	 You didn't know that your little brother is soon to be born?
		
Gladys 	Why don't you shut up?	
	
Junior	Gogo, sit down! Dineo,	 be nice to me. Soon, we'll be cousins. Go and sit next to Gogo.	 Get lost! Go and sit down!
		
Dineo 	I didn't know.
		
Junior	I'm hungry. Make me a sandwich. I said, go and make me a sandwich!
		
Gladys 	Go, Dineo.
		
Junior	Go, my girl.
		
Gladys	Go. Hey.
		
Junior	Listen. Don't you dare do anything funny. Do you hear me? If you do, I'll put a bullet in Granny's head, understand?
		
Dineo 	 Yes.
		
Junior	Woof!
		
Minister of Finance 	Deputy, what if that information is incorrect? Who is your source?
		
Deputy President 	Remember how loyal Victor was to Hendrik? Hendrik could do no wrong.
		
Minister of Finance 	But the President brought him back into cabinet. She never would've done that if he was tainted.
		
Deputy President 	I never supported her decision. But you know politics.	The President couldn't fire the whole cabinet. Sometimes in politics, you make deals with the devil.
		
Minister of Finance 	Deputy, you're our leader, right? Then lead us! Don't let us...work with sellouts.
		
Deputy President 	I can't! Look,	 for all I know, he could be working with other Ministers. I just need to know one thing from you. Can I trust you?
		
Minister of Finance 	Yes, yes.
		
Deputy President 	Okay. I say we sit on this information. Someone will blow their cover.
		
Minister of Finance 	Victor?
		
Minister of Police 	Excuse me. The live video is ready in the cabinet room. We're ready for the money handover.
		
Deputy President 	O... okay. So...uhm...	Let's gather other Ministers and watch it together.
		
President Mulaudzi	Where is this place?
		
Moses	Honourable,	 this is the opposite of hell. Sit down with your two bums.. with the Lord of mercy.	 And there's proper food.
		
President Mulaudzi	Why are you doing this?	 Why, Moses? This is so unlike you. What went wrong?
		
Moses	You're speaking rubbish now. You're trying to confuse me and break my spirit.	 I know you're trying to manipulate me. And guess what? That won't work. I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
		
President Mulaudzi	Well, I know you're not stupid. I also know you're smart. And you are skilled. Even skilled to brainwash people. That's how you managed to gather this whole community, these kids, and made them believe you. They believe you're some Robin Hood, and you'll give them riches. You and I know that's a lie. There's no community building here. It's all about you.
		
Moses	Look who's stunned about lies. Chief Liar! If such term exists. You tell lies up and down, day and night.	 Hey, you're such a liar! You hide behind Commissions and Ministers, but right now…you...I had a problem with the government and I asked you to help me. Did you help me? No. Nothing. So, get lost!
		
President Mulaudzi	Moses...	Are you comparing yourself to normal citizens after what you did? No one has done what you're doing. You're dancing at the door of treason. You're going to pay for this. This is not what you and I trained for, Comrade.
		
Moses	Hey, hey, hey! Don't drive me crazy, man! Don't compare yourself to me! You and I are not the same! You eat cheese while I eat crap! So, don't tell me nonsense. Get lost!
		
President Mulaudzi	You're right.	 You and I are not the same. And we will never be. This...this lunatic shouting and jumping up and down in front of me, I don't know him! I'm sure you don't even recognise yourself in the mirror anymore.		
Moses	You'll drive me crazy.	 You'll drive me insane! You'll make me do something I'll regret. You want me to believe your lies! You throw your fist in the air at rallies and shout "Power! To the people!" Promising people a better life! Go back to the Union Buildings and sleep in a mansion, while I...sleep in a shack. Eating crap for breakfast, lunch and supper. While you eat Sushi and slip into a gown. You know what, let me tell you something. Today you'll know...that I'm the Robin Hood of Soshanguve. I'll deal with you. You'll see hell. Bugger off!	 To hell with them! To hell with them! To hell with them! This is not the Union Building! Rubbish!
		
Bridget 	When did it start? What?	 You might as well tell me the truth. It's not like we're going anywhere.	 When did it start, Thabang?
		
Thabang 	I already told you. Zondo offered me R50 000 for a job...	
	
Bridget 	I'm not talking about you and Zondo. I'm talking about you and her. When did your affair start?
		
Thabang 	I can't talk about it, especially not now.
		
Bridget 	Every time I want to talk about that girl, you refuse.	
	
Thabang 	I can't.
		
Bridget 	Why? Was it nice when you did it behind my back?	
	
Thabang 	I was doing some upgrades at the President's house. The President's daughter and I started having a conversation…about some innocent stuff. Why are we talking about this? It's in the past. You know what happened. Why are you bringing it up now?	
	
Bridget 	I'm trying to save our marriage, Thabang! You know, I didn't care about your corrupt ways. In fact, I would have forgiven you for it. I would have forgiven you for it. But breaking our marriage, Thabang...You made a fool of me...in front of everyone. My parents warned me. They warned me, Thabang.	 They said one day I'd regret marrying someone like you. But I fought...I fought for you. And then you cheated on me with that child.	 How could you, Thabang?	 How could you fail me like that...after everything?
		
News Reporter 	This, Thembekile,	 and burnt tyres is the only thing that's left on the streets of Soshanguve…following a confrontation...
		
Gladys 	Sis! I curse the day you were born. family members were born. Look how much you've corrupted this country.
		
Junior 	You must be suffering from amnesia. What amnesia? This country is lucky to have been led by my father.
		
Gladys 	You call running the country into ruins, lucky? You're crazy! You people have ruined our lives.
		
Junior 	You People? How is my family different from yours? Thabang is no angel.
		
Gladys 	Thabang did nothing wrong! He's not the one out there toppling the government.	
	
Junior 	My family has done nothing but to save this county.
		
Gladys 	Save this country from what?	
	
Junior 	Don't you follow history?	
	
Gladys 	I do!
		
Junior 	My father spent seven years of his life on Robben Island.
		
Gladys 	He wasted seven years then, because he came out corrupt!
		
Junior 	Gogo, I'm not going to waste my breath with you. You've obviously been captured. Just like that?	 Don't you see you're serving a grown man? Clear this coffee table,	 bow respectfully and then tell me my food is ready. Don't just dump food as if you're feeding your dog. Didn't your father teach you any respect?
		
Gladys 	Don't talk to my child like that.  Shut up, old hag!
		
Junior 	I do the talking here!	 I'm the man. You'd better put that tray down with a smile on your face.	 Or I might just suspect you've poisoned my food. And retaliate. That wasn't so hard, hey? Let go of me!
		
Minister of Police 	The money van is minutes away from the township. We have back-up from the ground and aerial police. I've been communicating with Modise, he knows what to do.
		
Minister of Finance 	So...what you're saying is...we should take the government's money…It's not even our money. It belongs to the citizens. We'll take the citizens' money and hand it over to criminals? Is that what you're saying?
		
Minister of Police 	No. That's not what I meant. That money is just a bait until we see the President. That's why we have Modise and his team on standby. As soon as they see the President they'll move in and make arrests. People, I promise you.	 We'll get the President back without spending a cent.	
	
Minister of Finance 	No! What you should be promising us...is that we won't waste time running after township gangsters. You should be promising to get the mastermind behind this circus.
		
Minister of Police 	That's the ultimate goal.	 We just need a go-ahead from you, Mr. Deputy.
		
Deputy President 	Thank you.
		
Moses	Don't take things personally. No one will judge you. I mean, you're the first President to be kidnapped.
		
Minister of Police  	Is it him?
		
Deputy President 	Yes.
		
Moses	Tell me that my people...are getting their money. Yes.
		
Deputy President 	You'll get it in the next 10 minutes. It's on the way. But...we want to see the President first. Or there'll be no money.
		
Moses	You know how hostage situations work, right? You watch movies.
		
Deputy President 	As long as you know that this not some folk tale.		
			
Moses	Wait...Funi, Funi! You didn't think I'd pull it off, did you? The money is on its way. I've hit the jackpot.	 It was so simple. Easy cheesy. Mm. But tell me… don't you think...	I could be the President?
		
President Mulaudzi	Shame on you, Moses.	 Shame on you. I don't understand, Moses. This isn't what we fought for. You and I fought to free this country. For a better life. What happened to the dream we once had and fought for?	
	
Moses	Eish! I had a dream,	 until I woke up and realised it was just a dream. It was so painful to see the gravy train departing, leaving me behind without at least a drop of the gravy.
		
President Mulaudzi	It doesn't have to be like that. We still have a chance to change everything. It's possible.	 We can clean this country up. And start afresh. And if you're... keen, you can join me in the cabinet.
		
Moses	You really think you can fix this corrupt country? That's rubbish! From Cape to Limpopo's border,	 all the tenders awarded...had bribery involved. Look, brown envelopes were exchanged. And you think you can fix that? No Listen, my sister.	 Join the gravy train, too. Munch on. Take a bite. I'll give you a lunchbox...	just so you don't die of hunger on the road.
		
Karabo	Chief. Your parcel is here.
		
Moses	Yeah. Sure. Take her. Go!
		
Karabo	Hey, man! Move!
		
Moses	Mm. Yeah. Ms. Perfect President! Take off your clothes.
		
Junior 	You'd better pray I don't get out of this chair.	
	
Dineo 	I said, shut up! I do the talking now.
		
Gladys 	Call the police.
		
Dineo 	Where Are my parents?	
	
Gladys 	Shush and call the police.	
	
Dineo 	Where Are my parents?	
	
Junior 	Go to hell.
		
Dineo 	Don't underestimate me. I'll hurt you!	
	
Gladys 	Dineo, please don't do what I'm thinking, my child. Dineo. Dineo, I'm begging you. Please don't do it.
		
Junior 	They're at the butchery.	
	
Gladys 	Dineo! Dineo! This isn't a game.	
	
Junior 	Go to the butchery.
		
Gladys 	 Dineo, listen to me!
		
Junior 	 Go to the butchery.
		
Gladys 	You shut up!	 Listen, please don't do it.
		
Junior 	 Go to the butchery.
		
Dineo 	 I must save my parents.
		
Gladys 	Dineo...Dineo...This is not a game. Let's call the police to come and do their job.	
	
Dineo 	You call them.
		
Gladys 	Dineo! Don't walk out that door! Dineo! Dineo!
		
Junior 	 Go to the butchery, Dineo.
		
Gladys 	 Dineo! Dineo! Dineo!
		
Moses	Mm! Ah! Look how beautiful you are! These look good on you! Not that ugly outfit. It made you look like an ostrich. Look at you now! You know what, I could ask you out now. Mm?	
	
News Reporter 	Thembekile, with the president still missing, we have learnt from a reliable source within the Presidency…that the Deputy President has taken over and he has agreed…to actually give the kidnappers the ransom of R1.2 billion. They've demanded that money for the release of President Mulaudzi.		
Deputy President 	I'm starting to think that...the Minister of Police is not the mole.	
	
Minister of Finance	But if it's not him, then...	Who is it?
		
Deputy President 	Then who is it?
		
Minister of Police 	That was Modise.	 He says the money van has arrived.
		
Katlego 	Rocky! In order for this plan to work, I'm going to need everyone hands-on. Am I clear?
		
Guard	Yes.
		
Katlego 	I don't want any casualties! You hear me? The whole world is watching us today! Here's what will happen No one will move before we see the President. Do you hear me? The first team, when you see the President, I want you to move the crowd out of the way! Team B, go in and get the President!
		
Moses	Are we good to go?
		
Deputy President 	The truck has arrived. We're just waiting...for you to release the President, as per our agreement, then you'll get your ransom.
		
Moses	What if you're lying to me?
		
Deputy President 	I gave you my word...	and I delivered. Now it's your turn.
		
Moses	Hey! I need confirmation. I have to be sure that the money is inside that truck. I want proof!
		
Deputy President 	Give me a second.
		
Moses 	Hey! I'm not playing games here! Don't mess with me, man!
		
Katlego 	Yes? Yes, Minister?
		
Minister of Police 	 Katlego.	 Go to the money truck, get one bag out, and show it to them, they want proof of the money.
		
Katlego 	Okay, Minister. Give me one bag of money! Open! The bag!
		
Minister of Finance 	I hope he's coming.	 Bring the money.
		
Deputy President 	Minister.
		
Karabo	Sure. They have it. They have the money.
		
Moses 	Good. Listen,	 stay there and follow the plan. Tell them to drive the truck inside.
		
Deputy President 	I'm afraid we can't do that. We agreed you'd get the money when you release the President.
		
Moses	What the hell, man!	 Why are you delaying me? Look, if I don't get my money now,	 I'll shoot her in the country's full view! Do you hear me?
		
Deputy President 	Minister!
		
Minister of Police 	Katlego, talk to me.	 Do we have the President?
		
Katlego 	Give me one minute, Minister.
		
Minister of Police 	We don't have a moment!
		
Katlego 	No, I haven't seen her.
		
Phone Operator	Your call has been placed on hold. Please wait.
		
Moses	Damn! Shit! Karabo. Where are you?
		
Karabo	Chief, what's up?
		
Moses	That dog didn't bite. We move to plan B. Shit! Damn!
		
Karabo	Run.
		
Katlego 	Rocky! Get her! Rocky, get her! It's not her!
		
Minister of Police 	Katlego, do we have the President?
		
Katlego 	No, we don't have eyes on her, Minister! I repeat, stand down!
		
Minister of Police 	We don't have the President.
		
Katlego 	Stop it.
		
Deputy President 	What do you mean, we don't have the President?
		
Minister of Police 	Katlego, are you sure?
		
Katlego 	It's not her! Bring it back!	 What are you doing?
		
Deputy President 	Are you kidding me? Why was that truck in Soshanguve? Why was the money truck in Soshanguve? This was not part of the plan!	
	
Minister of Finance 	Calm down.
		
Deputy President 	Victor, was this you?
		
Minister of Police 	What?
		
Deputy President 	Is it you? Are you the mole?
		
Minister of Police 	I beg your pardon?
		
Deputy President 	Are you working with them?	
	
Minister of Police 	Deputy, I would never, ever...betray my country.
		
Deputy President 	Then how did this happen?
		
Minister of Police 	I don't know.
		
Deputy President 	How did it...Maybe it's your team. What is that? They're taking orders from somewhere.
		
Minister of Police 	The people in that truck are not my team.
		
Deputy President 	Whose were they?
		
Minister of Police 	I don't know.	 They drove the truck from the Mint. Minister, they are your people, aren't they?
		
Minister of Finance 	No, Victor, Victor...
		
Minister of Police 	It's your people in the truck. They're from the Mint, right?
		
Minister of Finance 	Those are not my people. You know…	
	
Deputy President 	Tell me it's not true. Tell me this is not true!
		
Minister of Finance 	Deputy, I didn't send those people. Tell me you're not working with the enemy! I didn't send those people. Victor, please tell him. I don't know those people.
		
Deputy President 	Minister of Police, arrest this bastard.	
	
Minister of Finance 	What do you mean, Deputy?	
	
Deputy President 	Arrest this bastard!
		
Minister of Finance 	What do you mean, Deputy?  How dare you do this to me! Let me explain.
		
Deputy President 	I trusted you...and you do this to me?
		
Minister of Finance 	I didn't send anyone into the van. I...
		
Deputy President 	Arrest him!
		
Minister of Finance 	Deputy President...
		
Deputy President 	Arrest this bastard.
		
Guard	Minister...
		
Minister of Finance 	Deputy, I can explain. 	Victor! Victor!
		
Deputy President 	Take him away!	 Make sure we get that truck back.
		
Minister of Police 	Yes,
		
Moses	Well done, well done.
		
Karabo	Check there.
		
Moses 	Open.
		
Dog 	Check the coast! It's somewhere in there. Hold that. There you go, Boss.
		
Moses 	Ah!
		
Dog 	Here.
		
Moses 	Sure, sure. Enjoy your day. Take this. Listen.
		
Dog 	Thabang...
		
Moses	Eliminate him.
		
Dog 	Kill him?
		
Moses	He knows too much.
		
Dog 	Okay.
		
Moses	And he's useless.
		
Dog 	Sure.
		
Dineo 	Dad!
		
Thabang 	Baby!
		
Bridget 	Baby!
		
Dineo 	Dad!
		
Bridget 	Okay, okay, okay. Okay.	 Okay, baby, okay. Okay.
		
Deputy President 	Yes.
		
Moses 	Maquthu.
		
Deputy President 	Speak.
		
Moses 	Oh well, relax. It's done.	 There will be police everywhere.
		
Deputy President 	You'll have enough time to disappear.	
	
Moses 	No problem.
		
Deputy President 	Everything will go according to the plan. And my request?
		
Moses 	You will get it. Give me 30 minutes, and that dog will be dead. And you, my leadership,	 will become the number one citizen of South Africa. Maquthu.
