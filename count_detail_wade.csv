Nice to get away, huh?@22@21@21@17@17
Yeah. Remote.@13@11@11@10@10
Remote, huh?@12@11@11@10@10
Everything okay in there?@25@24@24@21@21
He bothering you?@17@16@16@14@14
Boy, you're a real mess.@24@23@22@19@18
Look at that.@13@12@12@10@10
Brought a knife to a gunfight, didn't even use it.@50@49@48@40@39
Mm.@3@2@2@2@2
Spicy.@6@5@5@5@5
What's your code?@17@16@15@14@13
So peaceful here, isn't it?@27@26@25@22@21
Remote.@7@6@6@6@6
Thank you.@10@9@9@8@8
Aw.@3@2@2@2@2
That's a good one.@18@17@16@14@13
Jenny.@6@5@5@5@5
God damn.@9@8@8@7@7
You're a lucky man.@19@18@17@15@14
Were.@5@4@4@4@4
Jesus Christ.@13@12@12@11@11
Come on.@8@7@7@6@6
Need help?@10@9@9@8@8
Like this?@10@9@9@8@8
Miranda?@8@7@7@7@7
Stop being a little bitch.@26@25@25@21@21
Come on out.@12@11@11@9@9
I'm not gonna hurt you.@23@22@21@18@17
Be a good girl now. Come on out.@32@30@30@23@23
I'll be your new daddy.@23@22@21@18@17
Miranda, don't make me angry.@29@28@27@24@23
Oh.@3@2@2@2@2
It's delicious. Thank you, hon.@31@29@28@25@24
Really?@7@6@6@6@6
Nance.@6@5@5@5@5
Excuse me.@10@9@9@8@8
Hi, Cupcake.@12@11@11@10@10
You better stop calling. Eddie might get jealous.@49@47@47@40@40
I can do this all night.@24@23@23@18@18
It's fine.@10@9@8@8@7
She's not alone.@16@15@14@13@12
What the--?@11@10@10@9@9
No, no, no, no. No.@19@17@17@13@13
Fuck.@5@4@4@4@4
Nice fucking trick.@19@18@18@16@16
Doesn't matter. You're all the same.@36@34@32@29@27
Fucking deceptive, manipulative fucking cunts.@46@45@45@41@41
She's not as smart as she thinks she is.@40@39@38@31@30
Well, she's about to be a dead little girl.@43@42@41@34@33
Survival,@9@9@9@9@9
the act or fact of living@25@25@25@20@20
or continuing longer than another person or thing.@50@49@49@42@42
That's the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition.@49@48@47@44@43
So basically, I don't have to run faster@40@40@39@33@32
than the man-eating tiger,@26@26@26@23@23
I just have to run faster than you.@35@34@34@27@27
That's what I mean by strategic default.@40@39@38@33@32
Say the value of your house@27@27@27@22@22
drops below what you owe on the mortgage.@41@40@40@33@33
What do you do?@15@14@14@11@11
You stop making payments.@25@24@24@21@21
Now it's not your problem. It's the bank's problem.@51@49@46@41@38
And fuck the bank.@18@17@17@14@14
So, if your business is going under, you just--@47@47@47@39@39
tuck your tail between your legs?@33@32@32@27@27
Close up shop? No.@18@16@16@13@13
No.@3@2@2@2@2
You take as much unsecured debt as you can,@43@43@43@35@35
in the name of the business, of course.@39@38@38@31@31
You cut expenses to the bone.@29@28@28@23@23
You leverage that cash to open a new business.@46@45@45@37@37
By the time the bank figures out@32@32@32@26@26
your old business is dead, you're on to your next target.@57@56@55@46@45
The key is to stay in the game.@31@30@30@23@23
Keep moving before anybody can figure out@41@41@41@35@35
what you're doing.@18@17@16@15@14
You keep moving forward like a shark. Right?@44@42@42@35@35
You're either predator or you're prey.@38@37@35@32@30
Survival of the fittest.@24@23@23@20@20
A simple concept,@17@17@17@15@15
but it's not as easy as it sounds.@34@33@32@26@25
You gotta take risks.@21@20@20@17@17
Why do I waste my time?@23@22@22@17@17
You know what, cut the camera.@30@29@29@24@24
Everybody get out.@18@17@17@15@15
What? I'm letting you go early, okay?@37@35@34@29@28
You're welcome.@15@14@13@13@12
Go. Everybody get the hell out of my classroom.@47@45@45@37@37
Robert.@7@6@6@6@6
Make sure and post the lecture today.@37@36@36@30@30
Don't fuck it up like last time.@32@31@30@25@24
And cancel my office hours. I'm going home.@43@41@40@34@33
Calm down, Jenny.@17@16@16@14@14
I want you to kill me.@22@21@21@16@16
Maybe I am. Maybe I am.@23@21@21@16@16
Take the fucking gun and shoot me.@34@33@33@27@27
Please.@7@6@6@6@6
Here, take the gun.@19@18@18@15@15
Stop asking the same question over and over, Jenny.@51@50@50@42@42
Here I am. Do it!@17@15@15@11@11
I did.@6@5@5@4@4
She's dead, Jenny! I fucking killed her!@40@38@37@32@31
Don't you get that?@19@18@17@15@14
Come on! Come on. Come here. Come here.@39@35@35@28@28
Come here. You can do it.@25@23@23@18@18
We'll do it together, okay? Come on.@36@34@33@28@27
I know you can do it.@21@20@20@15@15
You have to rack the gun, dummy.@32@31@31@25@25
Hi, Emily Cooper?@17@16@16@14@14
My name is Randy. I'm a nurse here@34@33@32@26@25
at the maternity ward,@22@22@22@19@19
and uh-- your mom, or your stepmom, I guess,@44@44@44@36@36
Jenny, is here with us.@23@22@22@18@18
She's very concerned about Miranda.@35@34@33@30@29
Can you tell me about her?@26@25@25@20@20
Uh-huh. Oh, that's great news.@30@28@27@24@23
She'll be very relieved.@24@23@22@20@19
Yeah. Yes, she is in labor,@27@26@26@21@21
but I'm sure it's still several hours away.@43@42@40@35@33
She would love it if you could do her a big favor@49@49@49@38@38
and stop by the house@21@21@21@17@17
to pick up her overnight bag that she left behind.@50@49@49@40@40
Yes. Yes, very exciting.@24@22@22@19@19
Little brother's on the way. Okay, bye-bye.@43@41@40@35@34
Our lucky day. They're on the way.@34@32@31@26@25
Welcome.@8@7@7@7@7
Hey, hey, hey.@14@13@13@11@11
Have a seat.@12@11@11@9@9
Wait.@5@4@4@4@4
Take it off.@12@11@11@9@9
Miranda, you're here next to me.@32@31@30@26@25
Hello, Emily Cooper. Nice to meet you in person.@48@46@46@38@38
We spoke on the phone.@22@21@21@17@17
Thanks for bringing Miranda home.@33@32@32@28@28
This is nice.@13@12@12@10@10
Let's hold hands.@17@16@15@14@13
Bow your heads.@15@14@14@12@12
Close your eyes.@16@15@15@13@13
Dear Lord,@10@10@10@9@9
thank you for your random acts of betrayal,@43@43@43@36@36
adultery, wrath,@16@16@16@15@15
and violence,@13@13@13@12@12
for destroying families@23@23@23@21@21
and lives,@10@10@10@9@9
leaving nothing but death@25@25@25@22@22
and destruction in your wake.@29@28@28@24@24
Thank you for the rage and the thrill of the chase.@51@50@50@40@40
And thank you for these three beautiful women...@48@45@45@38@38
and for the glorious day ahead.@31@30@30@25@25
Amen.@5@4@4@4@4
Okay, the hand-holding is over now.@35@34@34@29@29
Let go.@7@6@6@5@5
Let's get started, shall we?@28@27@26@23@22
Sometimes when my wife was in the mood,@39@39@39@32@32
she enjoyed...@14@11@11@10@10
sharing a bottle of bubbly.@27@26@26@22@22
Ah. My wife.@12@10@10@8@8
So beautiful.@13@12@12@11@11
Now?@4@3@3@3@3
She's at home.@14@13@12@11@10
Where I left her.@17@16@16@13@13
In bed.@7@6@6@5@5
Dead.@5@4@4@4@4
You like it?@12@11@11@9@9
God, you look so much like her.@31@30@30@24@24
You're a quick learner, Cupcake.@32@31@30@27@26
It doesn't matter.@18@17@16@15@14
