Deputy President	Fellow South Africans, 	earlier today, I reported that there was an incident in the township of Soshanguve. where our President, President Mulaudzi, was kidnapped. There’s no other way to say this President Mulaudzi has been shot. She's currently...in the medical care of our best surgeons and we hope for her speedy recovery. As your acting President, I want to give you my word. We will leave no stone unturned...in our pursuit of these perpetrators.

Hendrik	Do you know that? Did you ever think of what he will do?

Junior	We’ll be in Abu Dhabi.

Hendrik	Abu Dhabi, my foot! Do you think you'll be safe in Abu Dhabi? Huh? Junior!

Dogs	Boss. Boss!

Hendrik	What?

Thabang	She's just died. And my day...has been way too long.

Junior	Okay, okay, okay! Okay. Junior and Zondo are at a warehouse in Rosslyn, with the dogs.

News Anchor	Good afternoon, South Africa. From the NNC studios in Randburg. My name is Cathy Mohlahlana. What a whirlwind of day it's been. South Africans still reeling from the shocking discovery that Hendrik Zondo, former President of South Africa, has escaped from high security prison. It's after it was revealed that Zondo was behind the kidnapping of President Mulaudzi, The shutdown of Soshanguve and that ransom amount of 1.2 billion rand. At this point the detail of Zondo's escape are still emerging, but NNC has been realiably informed that his escape was well-planned and, apparently involved the death of at least one correctional services officer. Police roadblocks have been set throughout Soshanguve, including the greater Tshwane area. An anonomous tip-off line has also been established. Officals are calling for your help in locating him and at this point, Zondo's wherabouts remain unknown.

Moses	The DP wants to talk to you.

Hendrik	Cassius.

Deputy President	We had a deal. We had a deal and you backed out of it!

Hendrik	Everything is going as planned. The problem with you is that you like stressing.

Deputy President	Oh, okay. So it's my fault? Have you seen the news? Mulaudzi is alive.

Hendrik	What?

Deputy President	She's alive! Listen. Here is what will happen You’re not leaving without Mulaudzi’s head in your bag. Otherwise, our deal is off. Am I clear?

Hendrik  	Fine.?

Sindi	What's wrong, my dear

Hendrik	No, no...We have a little problem.

Sindi	What's wrong?

Hendrik	The President must die so the Deputy President can be sworn in. Or else we're in trouble. He’s waited ten years for that seat.

Sindi	She must die.

Junior	So one of us will show up at the hospital with all those police?

Hendrik	Yes. One of us.

Moses	No way. I can't do it... 

Hendrik	Don't you dare say that!

Moses	I’ve given you R1.2 billion. I’m done risking my life.

Hendrik	Hey! What did you say? You won't get a cent of your R50 million if you don't do this. Besides, you're the one who put us in this mess. You're a soldier, right? You are a soldier, right? Then the mission is not complete. Here.

President Mulaudzi	Modise. Modise. Modise!

Katlego	Ma’am? Ma’am.

President Mulaudzi	Where’s Bridget?

Katlego	She's alive. Everyone has made it.

President Mulaudzi	And Matseke?

Katlego	He escaped with the money.

President Mulaudzi	Tell me...there was a young boy, a teenager...amongst Moses' men.

Katlego	He’ll live. If I may ask, why are you asking?

President Mulaudzi	No. Nothing.

Katlego	I have bad news. Hendrik has escaped from prison.

President Mulaudzi	Oh, good Lord! Help me get up.

Katlego	No, Ma'am. Help...Please, Ma'am. 

President Mulaudzi	No. I need to go. I need to go to the Union Buildings. It's quite clear you're messing up there.

Katlego	We're on it, Ma'am. Please rest. You've lost a lot of blood. The Deputy President is handling everything right now.

President Mulaudzi	We need to end all of this. It must end.

Katlego	Ma'am, did you perhaps hear Moses or his people...mention where they'd be going?

President Mulaudzi	No. I was hoping you and your team...would have an idea...where Zondo might be hiding.

Katlego	No.

President Mulaudzi	It doesn't make sense. I don't understand. Zondo...just wanted some money, to be able to skip the country. Him wanting me dead...doesn't match. I don't get it.

Katlego	I think I should do another clean sweep of the hospital, just to make sure you're safe, Ma'am.

President Mulaudzi	Um... Katlego.

Katlego	Ma'am?

President Mulaudzi	Tell me. According to you, do you agree...or believe that...Moses is the only one...who wants me dead?


Thabang	Ness.

Female Analyst	What are you doing here, Thabang?

Thabang	I need your help.

Female Analyst	What now?

Thabang	I need guns.

Female Analyst	Why do you need guns?

Thabang	If they ask you what happened, tell them I had a gun to your head...

Female Analyst	Why do you need guns?

Thabang	I know where Junior is.

Female Analyst	Tell the police.

Thabang	Ness, if your mother was killed and you knew who killed her, would you call the police or deal with them yourself? I'm asking you. What would you do?

Sindi	No, no. Put it down. Here, sir. It has too much sugar.

President Mulaudzi	It's me...It's me, Cassius.

Deputy President	Madam President.

President Mulaudzi	I’m here, Cassius.

Deputy President	How are you doing?

President Mulaudzi	Been better, but I’ll be fine.

Deputy President	Thank goodness. We've all been holding our breath, especially me.

President Mulaudzi	I’ll survive. Cassius, we need to act fast. Someone on our side wants to kill me.

Deputy President	Yeah, I know.

President Mulaudzi	Then you can’t trust anyone in the cabinet. They could be working with Zondo.

Deputy President	I’ve already figured it out. The Minister of Finance is in jail.

President Mulaudzi	No, it's not him.

Deputy President	Yes, I’m also watching other cabinet members. I have my suspicions on a few people, but don't worry. I'm watching them.

President Mulaudzi	Thank you. I mean it.

Deputy President	Mm. I'm here. Listen, is there any information you can give me?

President Mulaudzi	No. Cassius, you’re the only person I can trust to finish this. The democracy of this country needs you.

Deputy President	Of course. I'm here. I’ll finish it.

President Mulaudzi	Thank you. Bye.

Hendrik	Go ahead, gents. I told them to stay on guard...until Moses calls to inform us that he's killed the President.

Sindi	How long do you think he’ll take?

Hendrik	It’s hard to say.

Junior	Moses knows what he’s doing. He’ll finish the President off soon.

Sindi	Well then, he better make it fast, because when these dogs start dropping, who will protect us?

Hendrik	How much poison did you put in the cake?

Sindi	Eish, my dear. A lot.

Hendrik	Where's Mbali?

Sindi	Mbali? She's...She's coming. Oh no! Mbali, Mbali, Mbali...Spit out the cake!

Mbali	What, Ma? 

Sindi	pit it out! Vomit it out!

Mbali	Oh, Lord! Why is this happening?

Junior	What should I do, Ma? 

Sindi	Go and get a few dogs. We need to get to the hospital. Don't just stand there! She'll die! 

Junior	We can't go to the hospital, Ma!

Dogs	Are you all right, sister?

Hendrik	Listen, get water and salt.

Sindi	What did the doctor say?

Hendrik	She’ll be okay as long as she vomits up all the cake.

Sindi	She needs to get to the hospital.

Hendrik	How? Do you want to go to prison?

Sindi	Hendrik, do you want your child to die?

Hendrik	Do you want to get arrested? If you want to go, count me out. Go and keep an eye on those boys. She'll be fine.

News Anchor	Let's take you live to the Union Buildings…where we understand that Deputy President Ndlovu has and update on President Mulaudzi's health status many being concerned on how she is doing…at this hour.

Deputy President	It gives me great pleasure to announce that our President..President Mulaudzi is in recovery after a successful surgery. I have spoken to her and she seems in good spirits. No bullet can keep our President down. I urge the public to  come forth with any information...that can lead to the arrest of ex-President, Mr. Hendrik Zondo. In the meantime, roadblocks have been set up in the area of Tshwane...to facilitate the capture of Mr. Zondo. As a nation, we cannot allow this brazen attack on our democracy. He will face the full might of the law. There will be no exceptions. Please keep President Muluadzi in your prayers…as we wish her a speedy recovery. That is all.

Sindi	Drink up, Mbali. 

Mbali	I can't! I can't! It hurts, Ma. I can’t do this anymore.

Sindi	Drink one last time. Drink.

Mbali	Why would you even poison the cake, to start with?

Sindi	Stop asking me questions and just drink.

Mbali	If the cake has poison, that means the dogs...No!

Sindi	Listen, your father did this to protect us. He had no choice. Those dogs know way too much about us.

Mbali	So he murders them, Ma? No. No! My baby. My baby! 

Sindi	You'll be fine.

Mbali	No! What’s going to happen to my baby? No, no, no!

Sindi	Mbali! You'll be fine.

Mbali	Leave me alone!

Police officer	Hey, Chief.

Thabang	Boss. 

Police officer	License, please.

Female Police officer	Hello, Sir. How are you? 

Moses	I'm fine and you, Ma'am?

Female Police officer	I'm fine. Where are you headed to?

Moses	My sister is sick, she's at the hospital.

Female Police officer	Oh, okay. You can go.

Moses	Thank you.

Police officer	Your car seems to be unroadworthy.

Thabang	No, it's perfect.

Police officer	With all those wires dangling? Huh? No way, get out. I need to inspect your car. It's unroadworthy. Come.

Thabang	Come on, bra. 

Police officer	No, get out. I'm not your bra. You think I'm playing a game? Face that side and put your hands on the car.

Thabang	Shh...Give me your gun. Don't let anyone see you.

Police officer	Okay, okay, okay.

Thabang	Relax. 

Police officer	I'm relaxed.

Thabang	Don't look at the other cops. 

Police officer	Yes. I won't.

Thabang	Relax and shut up. 

Police officer	Sure. I'm getting in.

Thabang	Relax, man.

Police officer	Okay, I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed, sir. I'm relaxed. Sorry. Please forgive me.

Junior	How is my sister?

Hendrik	She'll be fine. Hello, Moses. Is it done?

Moses	Listen, I think Ranaka is coming for you.

Hendrik	What did you say? He's coming here?

Moses	Yes, he's driving in your direction. I saw him at a roadblock.

Hendrik	Junior, tell the guys to get the guns ready and stop drinking.

Junior	Get ready for what?

Hendrik	Thabang is coming.

Police officer	Okay. I'm driving, Sir.

Thabang	Drive. 

Police officer	I'm driving. Please don't kill me. I have children, my brother.

Police officer	I... I... 

Thabang	Relax.

Police officer	Sure, Sir. I have children.

Thabang	Just relax.

Police officer	Doreen, Mahlatse and Kganya. And I love them. Okay, okay. 

Thabang	Relax.

Police officer	Okay, okay. Okay. Yes, officer. Okay.

Thabang	Drive. 

Police officer	Okay, okay.

Thabang	Relax, relax.

Police officer 2	What's going on here?

Police officer	No, boss... 

Police officer 2	Why is he not driving his car?

Police officer	He's drunk, I'm taking him to the police station.

Police officer 2	He's drunk? 

Police officer	For blood tests. Yes. This car is evidence. He's drunk. Yes. I... Yes. Okay, sure.

Police officer 2	Why don't you use a police van? 

Police officer	His car must be there as evidence. Sorry, Chief. You won't kill me, right?

Katlego	Modise.

President Mulaudzi	Madam President. Thank you, Sister.

Nurse	Okay.

President Mulaudzi	What’s the update?

Katlego	We have roadblocks all over the province. If Zondo tries to move, we will catch him. I have also deployed more police at the airports.

President Mulaudzi	That's good.

Katlego	I’ve also called for more men to come to the hospital.

President Mulaudzi	Still, be careful of him. He moves like a snake.

Katlego	Nothing will happen to you, Madam President.

President Mulaudzi	Zondo must have taken so long to plan all of this. He won't make a mistake of using a public airport. That would get him caught.

Katlego	What do you suggest?

President Mulaudzi	Make sure no flight flies out. Local and international. Shut down the air space.

Katlego	The Deputy President has already done that, Madam President.

President Mulaudzi	That's good.

Katlego	No one will get to you. I promise. Madam President.

Sindi	Eat this, so you don’t collapse.

Mbali	How do I know it's not poisoned?

Sindi	There's something you need to understand, Mbali. In life, sometimes one has to do whatever it takes to survive.

Mbali	Apartheid is over. We don’t need survival mode anymore.

Sindi	We always need to survive. The enemy never dies.

Mbali	Which enemy? You're killing people here! Dad's people have always protected us!

Sindi	If they were in our position, they'd be doing the very same thing we're doing.

Mbali	No, Ma. Other people don't steal and murder people, just like that.

Sindi	You're so full of yourself. Your father gave you the fancy life you have, and took you to top schools, now you're saying that? You have no respect.

Mbali	I don't know who's worse. Him, or you for allowing him to do this.

Sindi	I don't have a choice.

Mbali	No. You always have a choice. You can still save those people. They are human beings, Mama! They are not dogs! No matter what they did before, they don't deserve to die like this.

Sindi	Mbali, we have a plan and we need to stick to it. My hands are tied.

Hendrik	Gentlemen! 

Dogs	Yes, Boss?

Hendrik	Thabang is on his way here.

Dogs	Huh?

Hendrik	He's coming to attack us!

Dogs	Huh?

Hendrik	Today, he needs to learn a lesson, after what he did to my father... and to the movement.

Dogs	True.

Hendrik	Today, we'll make him pay...for what he did to us! He's coming here to attack, but he doesn't know we're aware. I'm telling you, he's coming here to take our money!

Dogs	He mustn't mess with us!

Hendrik	He's coming to take the money that we've worked so hard for!

Dogs	He's crazy!

Hendrik	Today, we must fight!

Dogs	Of course!

Hendrik	Fight for our money that we've worked so hard for!

Dogs	We worked hard for it!

Hendrik	Now, whoever kills Thabang Ranaka amongst you...gets a million.

Dogs	Wow! I'll do it!

Hendrik	There’s R1 million on the table for whoever kills Thabang. Am I clear, gents? Now, go and stand at the entrance of the property. Stand there and be on guard. The moment he walks in, attack him! What are you still waiting for? Go!

Dogs	Yes, Sir.

Guard	Today, we need to make a lot of money.

Guard 2	Sure.

Guard	We can do this.

Guard 2	Yes, we're going to Corner Bree.

Katlego	You're just standing there, laughing! What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? 

Guard	Sorry, Sir.

Katlego 	After the day we had, you're standing here, with no care? Focus, man!

Guard	Yes, sir.

Katlego 	Listen, if you see even the tiniest thing that's not supposed to be here, tell me right away. Do you hear me?

Guard	Yes, Sir.

Katlego 	I'd better not see you relaxed again. I'll fire you!

Moses	Filthy pig!

Nurse	BP 110/60 with possible concussion.

Nurse 2	What's wrong with him?

Nurse	He was hit by a car at the parking lot.

Nurse 2	I'm taking my lunch break.

Nurse	Okay.

Dogs	That bastard is here! Let's check that side! Let's go! Come, come! Let's go!

Hendrik	Come with me! Go, go, go! Go, go! Go to the front gate! Attack from the gate! What's wrong with you? What's wrong? Why are you wobbling here? Hey! Go and die far from here! Junior! Come here. What exactly are you doing here? Go and fix this mess! Hey! Get away from here! Go and die at the gate! Go away!

Katlego	My sister.

Nurse	Hello, Sir.

Katlego	Give me those tablets.

Nurse	All right. Oh, sorry.

Katlego	How many? 

Nurse	Take two.

Katlego	Thank you.

Hendrik	Run, run!

Mbali	What's going on, Dad?

Hendrik	Get inside the car and stop asking me questions! Hurry up! Lock it, don't get out! Come, gents! Why are you slow?

Katlego	Don't even think about it.

Junior	Please...Thabang! I didn’t kill your mother. It was an accident. Please. Let’s talk like men.

Thabang	Now you want to talk like men? Did you give my mother that chance?
