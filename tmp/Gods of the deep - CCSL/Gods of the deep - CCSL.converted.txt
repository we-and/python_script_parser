__VOICEOVER	Dr Goldstein. Rover Seven made it back to the surface. It seems to be working.
__VOICEOVER	Everything's been recorded,
__VOICEOVER	Chance to be Left alone.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	We found them.
RECEPTIONIST	Ah Mr Peter, there’s someone waiting for you in your office?
JAMES PETER	Waiting for me?
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	James Peters?
JAMES PETERS	I'm sorry, do I know you?
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	I'm Dr Julia Goldstein. I work for the pikmin corporation.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	It's inspiring to see you've been following in your father's footsteps. A researcher must be in the blood.
JAMES PETERS	I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in any more talks or lectures about my dad.
JAMES PETERS	I've written just about everything there is to know. So buy my books. I do my own research now.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	I know. The Mischatonic Astrobiology programme, partially funded by us
JAMES PETERS	Look, I'm not interested in any more handouts from the Pikmin Corporation.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Mr Peters, what if I were to tell you that Pikmin is selecting candidates for some new research
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	An expedition? One might say it's an astrobiologist's dream come true.
JAMES PETERS	An expedition?
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Our teams have been doing research in the Antarctic and southern Atlantic oceans for the past seven years.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Until a few months ago, when we found something unexpected.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Our team mapped a trench in the Antarctic continental shelf west of the MidAtlantic ridge between South America and Antarctica.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	We've collected over 12,000 square kilometres of data and we found a new, deepest point in the ocean of 37,000ft.
JAMES PETERS	How can that be possible?
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	We knew that the continental shelf was unusually deep, but it was something else on the ocean floor that caught us by surprise, shall we say.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	This is footage from a remote control sub we sent down there.
JAMES PETERS	What is that? It looks almost man made.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	We have a theory that it's some kind of portal.
JAMES PETERS	To where?
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	That, Mr Peters, is what we're going to find out
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	. Pikmin wants you to join the exposition team. I have some people I'd like you to meet.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Thank you, everyone, for attending at such short notice.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	You're finally about to see why this interruption to your busy lives is so very worth your time. I'll make the introductions.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	This is Gordon Atkins, head of the Man Submersibles laboratory at London's Royal Society for Improving Natural Knowledge.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	He's agreed to lead our expedition and is by far the most qualified man for the job
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Christine harris, marine biologist and member of the european marine biology symposium
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	. James Peters is developing our discovery programmes at the prestigious Mischatonic University and is something of an expert in the field of Pikmincorp's early research.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Joseph Meeker is our safety and communications officer. And finally, Hank O'Connell, our lead engineer. Hank, the floor is yours.
HANK O’CONNELL	Hello, everyone. I'm really very pleased to meet you all. Finally.
HANK O’CONNELL	I expect you will be wondering what it is I've engineered. Through the Pittman Corporation, my team have managed to build a deep diving submersible like nothing that's ever existed before.
HANK O’CONNELL	This is providence 3. 250 tonnes, built with syntactic foam, capable of withstanding the huge compressive forces of the water at 37,000ft and below.
GORDON ATKINS	Impressive, Hank.
JOSEPH MEEKER	Makes you wonder what happened to Providence One and Two, though
HANK O’CONNELL	so state of the art that it can safely take us into this ancient opening in the Earth's seabed Hydrosphere.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	I'm sorry? Into the opening? Didn't you say you sent remote operated vehicles in that never came out?
HANK O’CONNELL	Oh, yes. Some have made it back.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Some?
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Listen, we aren't going to pretend that this isn't a risky expedition. We wouldn't launch Providence Three with a crew on board if we weren't 100% certain our technology was safe.
HANK O’CONNELL	Test dives have been completed with highly satisfying results. Now all it needs is a crew.
GORDON ATKINS	What do you expect us to find down there?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	What if there's nothing but pitch black, watery abyss?
JED PICKMAN	The ocean is the last great frontier of our world
JED PICKMAN	. I have dedicated my whole life to seeking out the unknown and the incomprehensible, and this gateway might be my greatest discovery.
JED PICKMAN	It demands to be explored. Miss Harris. If something built that structure, just imagine what might lie within it.
JED PICKMAN	Secrets of the ocean. There is a hidden world beneath us, gentlemen, ladies, unseen by human eyes. Because up until now, we have been unable to create the technology necessary to take us there.
JED PICKMAN	Your mission as the crew of Providence Three is to be that interface between our technology and that new dark continent we aim to explore.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	These files contain the key data collected so far and outline the expedition.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	You'll need to complete two months of training before the dive. Read them closely. You have 24 hours to decide whether you're in or out.
JED PICKMAN	James, I'm so glad you came. Walt will be so proud to see us exploring the unknown together.
JAMES PETERS	Thank you, Mr. Pickman. It's a lot to think about.
JED PICKMAN	It is. But I wouldn't want to make this trip without you. It wouldn't seem right. For Walt's sake. I need you there
HANK O’CONNELL	. I've been counting down the days to finally meet in this crew. We've worked so hard, overcome so many challenges to get this far right.
JOSEPH MEEKER	Who wants another drink.
JAMES PETERS	Yes, please.
JOSEPH MEEKER	Yeah. Got you.
JAMES PETERS	Well, I don't think we'll be eating like this at the bottom of the ocean, so I'm going to enjoy it while I can.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You up for it, then?
JAMES PETERS	Voyage to the deepest part of the planet anyone's ever been.
JAMES PETERS	How could I walk away from that?
GORDON ATKINS	There's nothing to beat it being out there in the deep sea firsthand. Research. It's what we were born to do, right?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You know, I just I can't comprehend the water pressure at 30,000ft or whatever.
GORDON ATKINS	Weight of an entire ocean pressing down on you if anything goes wrong.
JAMES PETERS	All right. Now I'm worried
HANK O’CONNELL	you're putting your life in my hands.
GORDON ATKINS	Very capable hands, though.
JOSEPH MEEKER	Here we go. Cheers, team.
EVERYONE	Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.
GORDON ATKINS	Not really what we were designed to do, though, is it?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Sounds risky.
GORDON ATKINS	Expect the unexpected. First rule of deep sea exploration
JOSEPH MEEKER	we'll all sleep better tonight knowing that. Thank you, Gordon.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You've done this before, then?
GORDON ATKINS	Many times. Never this deep though. We'll be setting a new record.
JOSEPH MEEKER	Everything you do is five times harder in the ocean. Okay.
JOSEPH MEEKER	Just remember that
CHRISTINE HARRIS	you're still going along with it. All of you.
JOSEPH MEEKER	It's like the old man said. It is the chance of a lifetime.
HANK O’CONNELL	Well team, To Providence. Three.
EVERYONE	Providence, three.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Guys, I need some fresh air. I'll be right back.
JOSEPH MEEKER	Do you want me to get you another drink?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	No, I've had enough. Really?
JAMES PETERS	Sorry. Excuse me.
JAMES PETERS	Hey. You okay?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Doesn't it scare you at all?
JAMES PETERS	I don't know.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	I have this respect for the ocean. It's my life. But I know it can turn on you in a heartbeat.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	So you think the others know who you are? Peters, I haven't put two and two together yet.
JAMES PETERS	So you noticed?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Yeah, obviously. I had to research Pittman when Dr. Goldstein contacted us you Know.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	see what he's into, his history. What was it like growing up around something like that? I mean, the stories and the legends and all the theories.
JAMES PETERS	I'd rather just have my dad back.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You mean they really never found him? That wasn't some hook just to sell more copies?
JAMES PETERS	Gone without a trace.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	I'm sorry.
JAMES PETERS	It's okay. It was a long time ago.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Look, Jim, I don't think they would send us down there and spend all this money if they weren't certain there was more for us to discover.
JAMES PETERS	Well, you think there's something they're not telling us?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	If I go on this expedition, I need to know that I'm coming home.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	This is my son. He's seven months old and I'm all he's got. My parents are looking after him.
JAMES PETERS	What's he called?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Sam. Look, I know what a huge sacrifice I'll be making.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	I mean, with the training and the trip and the time away from him is going to kill me.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	But if everything goes to plan, I'll be back before his first birthday and maybe I could live with that.
JAMES PETERS	What if it doesn't go to plan?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Something tells me these things rarely do.
HANK O’CONNELL	Mr Pickman
JED PICKMAN	Thank you.
HANK O’CONNELL	All ready there jim?
JAMES PETERS	Can say I slept much last night?
JAMES PETERS	Just going over and over everything, you know, everything that could go wrong.
GORDON ATKINS	That's normal, Jim.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You know, you shouldn't smoke so much. Captain. It increases anxiety and tension
GORDON ATKINS	I like to be tensed dear. Keeps the senses sharp.
GORDON ATKINS	You want to Ciggy, Jim?
JAMES PETERS	No thanks.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Want a dramamine?
JAMES PETERS	Ooh yeah you have some?
JAMES PETERS	Hey uh, How far are we going?
HANK O’CONNELL	You'll see.
HANK O’CONNELL	She's out there waiting for us.
RACHEL	Command centre, standby.
RACHEL	We are awaiting cruise arrival at Providence three.
CAMERON	Morning, Dr. Goldstein.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	How long?
CAMERON	We are launching in 1 hour. Weather conditions are looking perfect for another couple of hours.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Where's our feet?
RACHEL	P three, rear cam one and rear cam two..
RACHEL	We have a clear signal. P three front cam is live and rover cameras will be activated upon launch.
RACHEL	We're all set for them.
RACHEL	Crew approaching p three. Commenced launch operation in T minus
RACHEL	twelve minutes. Standby for entry
GORDON ATKINS	welcome to Providence.
JOE MEEKER	Okay team, let's go. Go
JOE MEEKER	. We've got 20 hours of life support. Takes 1 hour and 30 minutes to get to the sea bed.
JOE MEEKER	Let's not waste any oxygen.
GORDON ATKINS	Chris,
JAMES PETERS	Man, oh, man. This is not a simulation anymore.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Ready to pilot that thing, jimmy.
JAMES PETERS	I have a dreadful feeling I'm looking at my own very expensive coffin.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	What, two months training wasn't enough for you? You're collecting rock samples, not landing on Mars.
JAMES PETERS	What's the difference.
GORDON ATKINS	This is providence Three to DP control how do you copy? Over.
RACHEL	We're receiving you loud and clear, P three.
GORDON ATKINS	Okay, you have a good comms. Voice here. Is that you, Miss Rachel?
RACHEL	How's it looking out there, Gordon.
JOE MEEKER	Life support's good. O two levels good.
GORDON ATKINS	Oh, we're groovy. Apart from the fact there’s a thousand horrible ways to die down here at the bottom of the ocean.
GORDON ATKINS	We're feeling pretty great about it.
HANK O’CONNELL	Okay, Mr. Pickman?
JED PICKMAN	More than okay. She's remarkable.
HANK O’CONNELL	Hutch is secure captain.
GORDON ATKINS	Roger that Hank
GORDON ATKINS	Be advised, we are in position and go for launch ops.
CAMERON	Three minutes to commence launch operation over.
GORDON ATKINS	Roger that, DP control. I'm going to open the vents.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We are clear to vent.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Opening now.
HANK O’CONNELL	Don't worry. If it buckles, the whole thing will implode at hypersonic speed and we'll be jelly in a matter of microseconds.
JAMES PETERS	What?
HANK O’CONNELL	We won't have time to even know it's happened.
JOE MEEKER	Pre-dive safety briefing's alreadycompleted.
RACHEL	All right, P three. Let's do final checks.
GORDON ATKINS	Final checks.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Vision one. CO2 is running at 0.3%.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Scrubber fan is running. Depth gauge is working. Compass is working.
GORDON ATKINS	Okay, I think we're ready. DP control, we are clear to launch.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Affirmative.
RACHEL	Good luck on your voyage to the deep. P three, you have permission to dive.
GORDON ATKINS	Copy that. And heading down.
JOE MEEKER	Say goodbye to the surface. Worlds
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Approaching 20 metres.
GORDON ATKINS	Vents are secure.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	40 metres
RACHEL	P three, what's your speed?
GORDON ATKINS	Vertical speed 3.4 knots. I have good control.
RACHEL	Copy that.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We're losing light already
CAMERON	approaching 100 metres.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Okay, team, good job.
RACHEL	Right on course.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	10,500 metres. Five minutes. Till target depth.
GORDON ATKINS	In 400 metres. We've set a new record.
HANK O’CONNELL	The pressure lock
HANK O’CONNELL	once the rover is fully submerged. We seal you in.
HANK O’CONNELL	Then we activate the exit doors.
HANK O’CONNELL	Then you're on your own out there. Ready to explore the deep. Just remember your training piece of cake.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Hank. Jim. You need to come and see this.
JAMES PETERS	What is it
CHRISTINE HARRIS	turn on front spotlight.
GORDON ATKINS	Are you ready to see this in person
JAMES PETERS	we're here already
JOE MEEKER	x coordinates -26 y coordinates -79
GORDON ATKINS	DP control we have arrived it.
RACHEL	Just keep talking p3
GORDON ATKINS	we're looking at a huge carbonate structure a circular gateway.
GORDON ATKINS	It's unreal.
JOE MEEKER	Yeah. Planet earth's butthole just where I want to be.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	no volcanic activity causes this kind of detail.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	These rocks were put here
JAMES PETERS	by what they're the size of houses.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	All I know is that this place will teach us more than we've ever dreamed.
GORDON ATKINS	I'm easing us into the gateway. Speed is 2.3 knots.
GORDON ATKINS	Spotlights are facing forward. But we're just headed into absolute darkness.
RACHEL	P three, you must keep talking to us as you move into the gateway.
CAMERON	Signal is currently running at 100%. Everything's stable.
CAMERON	Picture is all good on front and rear cams.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You're loud and clear.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	GORDAN
GORDON ATKINS	Everything is shutting down.
RACHEL	What’s going on down there?
GORDON ATKINS	I’ve lost thrust
GORDON ATKINS	Hank!
RACHEL	P3 come in!
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Try to get better signal.
RACHEL	I am trying.
GORDON ATKINS	Activate emergency power.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	DB control, are you reading?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Come in, DB control. Rachel, can you hear us?
GORDON ATKINS	We've lost them.
JAMES PETERS	Hey, everybody just cool it, all right?
HANK O’CONNELL	Gordon, are the thrusters still malfunctioning?
GORDON ATKINS	It's everything, Hank. Everything is shut down.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We're still sinking. Depth is approaching 1100 metres.
GORDON ATKINS	I'm dropping our weights. We can't just sit here.
HANK O’CONNELL	stop. Hang on, Gordon. Not yet. Give it a chance. Remember where we are. We made it.
JOE MEEKER	I’m going to find Pickman.
JAMES PETERS	Wait. Take this.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	I guess we're on our own down there then.
JOE MEEKER	Jesus. Pickman
JED PICKMAN	We found them.
HANK O’CONNELL	All right. We're back on
RACHEL	p. Three. Do you copy? Come in p three.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	TP control, we copy.
RACHEL	What happened down there?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Looks like we lost power and we entered the portal. We've definitely stumbled on something here.
RACHEL	3 hours of radio silence. You don't know how glad I am to hear your voice.
HANK O’CONNELL	3 hours? Did she say 3 hours?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Please repeat DP Control, how long did you say we were out of contact?
RACHEL	3 hours and twelve minutes since your last transmission, P. Three.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	That's impossible.
GORDON ATKINS	Hank, check our life support
HANK O’CONNELL	Life support has decreased approximately 3 hours. She's right.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	What does that mean?
CAMERON	We're not getting anything up here. P. Three.
CAMERON	There's disruption on the feed. A lot of static interference.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Oh, my God.
GORDON ATKINS	Describe what we're looking at.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Okay. I hope you can hear me clearly enough. We're drifting above a huge, ancient ruin.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	There are decayed stone structures as big as mountains. How could there have ever been life down here?
JAMES PETERS	Sunlight could have never reached this place.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	That implies a whole new basis of life. One that doesn't need the sun, only water
GORDON ATKINS	and darkness.
JAMES PETERS	Maybe it wasn't always underwater.
GORDON ATKINS	There's something on the seabed.
JAMES PETERS	Manoeuvre, the camera pan down. Get a better view of it.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Rachel, are you seeing this?
CAMERON	I think I'm getting something. Look.
RACHEL	That looks like some kind of life form, doesn't it?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Copy that.
GORDON ATKINS	Impossible.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	It's definitely some sort of remains buried under centuries of sediment buildup.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	I want to get a closer look at that. Where is Mr. Peters?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	He's right here.
JAMES PETERS	Peters.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	James, I need a tissue sample from that deep sea organism, whatever it is. Understood.
JAMES PETERS	Copy that.
JED PICKMAN	This is the payoff. The answer to our deepest wonders.
JED PICKMAN	So many secrets we must know. It's on you, Jim.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You’re going to be alright
JAMES PETERS	Yeah
JAMES PETERS	I’ll be alright.
HANK O’CONNELL	repressurizing lock.
HANK O’CONNELL	Brace for launch, Jim.
HANK O’CONNELL	Rover clear for launch
GORDON ATKINS	Opening pressure Lock outer doors now.
HANK O’CONNELL	Launch successful.
GORDON ATKINS	You okay?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Just don't let anything happen to him out there.
GORDON ATKINS	Jim, are you receiving
JAMES PETERS	life support's All good.
JAMES PETERS	There's more current down here than I expected, but I've got good control.
GORDON ATKINS	Okay, take her down.
JAMES PETERS	All lights facing down. Increasing vertical speed to 1.4 knots.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You're doing good, Jim. 38,000ft.
JAMES PETERS	Oh, man. Feels pretty lonely out here right now.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We're right here with you, Jim.
JAMES PETERS	Guys, are you seeing this?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Clear image from our rover cams.
GORDON ATKINS	Gently now.
JAMES PETERS	300 units of down thrust.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Take it easy, Jim. You're right on top of that thing.
JED PECKHAM	Look at that creature.
JAMES PETERS	What was this?
GORDON ATKINS	Starboard 20 degrees and ease her down.
JAMES PETERS	Whatever this thing was, it's colossal up close. Could have been as tall as the Empire State Building.
JOE MEEKER	Okay, Jim, you can't afford to waste much time. Get the tissue sample. Get the hell out of there.
JAMES PETERS	Affirmative. I'm in position.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	His depth gauge isn't reading anything. Should we be worried?
JOE MEEKER	We haven't got time to worry. He's doing fine.
GORDON ATKINS	Nice and easy.
JAMES PETERS	Oh, Jesus. It's like whale blubber. Looks like some sort of cephalopod
JED PECKHAM	deep sea gigantism on an epic scale.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	I can't understand how it hasn't deteriorated. Maybe the dissolved oxygen levels down here.
JOE MEEKER	Makes you wonder how long it's been dead.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Guys, check out. Rear cam. Something's moving out there.
GORDON ATKINS	Moving?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You didn't see it?
JAMES PETERS	I've almost finished the insision. I can't see shit out here.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Gordon. I'm picking up movement.
GORDON ATKINS	Impossible. Nothing could be alive down here.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	It's reading a lifeform.
JOE MEEKER	It's reading Jim.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	This is too big to be jim, this is massive.
JOE MEEKER	Well, then it's reading wrong. Everything's clitching since we entered the portal.
JOE MEEKER	Don't say anything until he's got the sample. He's nearly there.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	He might be in danger.
JOE MEEKER	One more minute and he's got the sample.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	He might not have a minute. Let me talk to him.
GORDON ATKINS	NO!,
JOE MEEKER	the corporation did not spend all of this money for us to come back with nothing. Let Jim do his job.
JAMES PETERS	All right, guys, I got. Got it.
GORDON ATKINS	okay. Jim.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Gordon, please get him out of there.
GORDON ATKINS	Is the sample secure, Jim?
JED PICKMAN	Just a little longer.
JAMES PETERS	Sample is secure, but I've lost my starboard horizontal pressure. Guys,
JAMES PETERS	we've got a lot of paleos here. This isn't looking good.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Don't panic.
GORDON ATKINS	Jim, please respond.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	He's not hearing us.
GORDON ATKINS	Signal's gone.
JAMES PETERS	Hello? Gordon?
JOE MEEKER	It’s moving again, whatever it is.
JOE MEEKER	We've just lost communication with Cord locker. Something scrambling our radios out there.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Don’t lose him!
JOE MEEKER	What the fuck is that? I'm not going any closer.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We're not leaving without him. Take us down.
GORDON ATKINS	Are you insane?
WALTON PETERS	This is what you wanted Pickman, anencounter with the Gods... Aren't theyas immeasurable as you recall?
GORDON ATKINS	DP control,permission to abort.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Permission denied Atkins, retrieve thatr o v e r before you begin your ascent .
GORDON ATKINS	Are you not seeing this!? Permissionto abort!
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Permission denied Gordon - I'm not losing that sample.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Sea; the pressure lock We're bringing him in now.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Some strange electromagnetism.
JOE MEEKER	Gordon. Take us down.
GORDON ATKINS	What is that?
JOE MEEKER	Goddamnit Gordon Take us down
GORDON ATKINS	No. No, we're too close.
JOE MEEKER	Fuck
HANK O’CONNELL	CHRISTINE
JAMES PETERS	P3 My thrusters are back.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Your SI is not looking good. Get as close to us as you can.
GORDANS ATIKINS	We gotta move
JAMES PETERS	Gordan I’m heading back
GORDANS ATIKINS	Prepare to board
HANK O’CONNELL	NO! Stop!
HANK O’CONNELL	Gordon stop. Don't open the heaven door.
HANK O’CONNELL	Christine. She's in the pressure lock
GORDANS ATIKINS	What
HANK O’CONNELL	She's in the water. Open the inner door.
HANK O’CONNELL	She'll blast from the ocean. She'll die. Gordon.
HANK O’CONNELL	Jim, you'll have to hang on it.
HANK O’CONNELL	Come on, give me a hand. Help me get her out.
JAMES PETERS	Gordon the doors aren’t opening.
JAMES PETERS	Gordon I’m out of time!
GORDANS ATIKINS	Jim, Hang in there. We've got a problem.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Chris is trapped in the pressure lock.
JAMES PETERS	What!
GORDANS ATIKINS	have to wait for the pressure lock to reseal? I can't let you in.
JAMES PETERS	OH. Fuck.
HANK O’CONNOLL	Quick quick
HANK O’CONNOLL	All right. Joe, help her.
JOE MEEKER	Help her. She's fucking dead.
HANK O’CONNOLL	We'll do something you’re the fucking safety. Officer
HANK O’CONNOLL	Gordon, I'm closing The pressure lock.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Hank. We're taking on water
GORDANS ATIKINS	The front end is compromised.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Hank, what's going on down there? Hank?
HANK O’CONNOLL	Gordon - I think we lost her.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Never mind that, Hank. Check, the bunk room.
GORDANS ATIKINS	I'm reading severe damage down there.
GORDANS ATIKINS	This whole tub is going to go down if I don't drop weight now.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Jim, I'm opening the outer doors.
JAMES PETERS	Hold on. I'm getting into position.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Jim, get your ass in here now.
HANK O’CONNOLL	Pickman. Get out of here.
JAMES PETERS	Ten more seconds Gordon.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Hurry.
HANK O’CONNOLL	Gordon, the entire pump room flooding. I'm stealing off this tunnel.
HANK O’CONNOLL	Drop weights now or we’ll drag us down
GORDANS ATIKINS	Doors are still closing. Jim's in there.
HANK O’CONNOLL	We don't have time, Gordon. We can't stand with this much water on board.
HANK O’CONNOLL	GORDON!
GORDANS ATIKINS	5 seconds. We can wait 5 seconds.
GORDANS ATIKINS	It's too late. Jim. I'm dropping weight.Hold on.
JAMES PETERS	Does anybody copy?
GORDANS ATIKINS	DP Control, we're leaving the bottom.
GORDANS ATIKINS	It X minus two seven eight. Y minus seven eight.
RACHEL	Is it following you, Gordon?
GORDANS ATIKINS	I don't know.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Check, the radar.
HANK O’CONNOLL	I can’t get this door to move, Jed
HANK O’CONNOLL	I can’t get out
JED PICKMAN	Look at it Hank
JED PICKMAN	Look at the devastation they can cause. Just one of them against all of us.
JED PICKMAN	Our brilliant minds totally defenceless against them.
HANK O’CONNOLL	What are you talking about?
JED PICKMAN	They're brilliant, Hank. Brilliant.
JAMES PETERS	Noo no no
JAMES PETERS	No no no no
JAMES PETERS	Why won’t you help her.
JAMES PETERS	Why won’t you help damnit!
JAMES PETERS	Jesus.
JAMES PETERS	No. Come on, Chris. Come on. Don't fucking leave me down here without you.
JAMES PETERS	Come on. Please.
JAMES PETERS	Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Fuck. Please, Chris, please.
JAMES PETERS	Come on. Come on. Breathe, damn it. Breathe. Come on, Chris. Come on.
JAMES PETERS	Come on. Come on. Come on. Just breathe. Just breathe.
JAMES PETERS	You're alright. You're alright. You're alright.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Jim
JOE MEEKER	O’Connell’s dead.
JOE MEEKER	See for yourself if you want to. He's floating in between the doors.
JOE MEEKER	The whole front of the sub is underwater.
JAMES PETERS	Are you sure?
JOE MEEKER	Well, unless he went for a swim.
JAMES PETERS	Well, you thought Chris was dead. Look how that turned out.
JOE MEEKER	Hey, I'm not the one who finished the fucking pressure lock. She wasn't breathing.
JOE MEEKER	How was I to know that? We should all just be grateful that any of us are still alive. Fuck.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	How long till we're back on the surface, Gordon?
GORDANS ATIKINS	Well, kids, can't say for sure. We've taken on a fuck tonne of water.
JOE MEEKER	Hank said not to smoke in here.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Do you want one, Jim? Help yourself. We'll smoke in his memory.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	How long can we survive like this down here?
GORDANS ATIKINS	We've got three more hours of life support left. Can't see it taking us more than 2 hours to get to the surface, but I can't be sure.
GORDANS ATIKINS	The longer we're down here, the heavier we get, the slower we ascend.
JOE MEEKER	3 hours seems tight.
GORDANS ATIKINS	It is tight. But there's nothing more I can do about it.
GORDANS ATIKINS	Let's hope there's no more nasty surprises.
JAMES PETERS	It's a tissue sample.
JED PECKMAN	Do you hear them Jim? Calling to us...the Gods... of the Deep! Howling to beperceived by human minds...
JED PECKMAN	This tiny specimen, it's going to change everything we know. Everything we ever thought we knew.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Don't touch it.
JED PECKMAN	We need to get this done to the lab and isolate it quickly. Now, before it deteriorates.
JAMES PETERS	Maybe we should seal it in the pressure lock.
JED PECKMAN	No. I want this preserved properly in the lab.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Pickman This is something that hasn't been out of the water for millions of years.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We have no idea what we're exposing ourselves to by bringing this on board.
JED PECKMAN	Miss Harris, do you really think you came all the way down here just to look at it?
JAMES PETERS	We didn't know we were collecting living tissue.
JED PECKMAN	So many answers await us. Jim. I don't have time to waste it. Careful. Joseph.
JAMES PETERS	Where are you going?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We can't stop them examining that thing. So someone who knows what they're doing should go supervise.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Make sure they keep it contained.
GORDANS ATIKINS	3 hours. Jim, I suggest you go with them. Make sure they do nothing stupid.
GORDANS ATIKINS	I've not seen Pikmin like this since a long time. He's not thinking straight.
JAMES PETERS	I don't know if any of us are anymore.
GORDANS ATIKINS	DP control we are a little under threehours from reaching the surface.
GORDANS ATIKINS	The tissue sample is securely on board. We have one casualty, O'Connell didn'tmake it.
JED PECKMAN	Seems like it's mostly adipose tissue.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Body fat. This is a big piece you took.
JOE MEEKER	Yeah. No surprise it tried to knock us halfway across the ocean.
JED PECKMAN	Totally disconnected from the body, but still reactive. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Imagine what we could learn from an organism like this. A flesh that still lives on after it's been severed from the body.
JED PECKMAN	It still thinks it's part of the sea beast. I think that it senses us.
JAMES PETERS	And I say we leave it the hell alone and wait till it's safely back at the research base.
JED PECKMAN	Hank built this so we could do immediate research.
JAMES PETERS	Unexpected things happen when we mess with stuff we don't understand.
JED PECKMAN	How do you know this thing will still be moving? Active secreting slime like it is once we get it back to the surface.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Guys
JAMES PETERS	If you don't mind. I'll take my chances.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Jim.
JAMES PETERS	Chris, get away from it.
JED PECKMAN	It knows we're here.
JAMES PETERS	Can't we freeze it?
JOE WEEKER	I think we've pissed it off enough already.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	PiCkman. Jim's right. We need to keep this contained.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We should seal the lab. We have no idea what we're dealing with.
JED PECKMAN	I'm paying you to be the biologist here.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	I am not risking someone else's life for this expedition. Science trip is over.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Jim, get him out of here and help me lock this place up.
JAMES PETERS	You heard her.
JOE WEEKER	Dr. Goldstein.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Joseph, tell me the specimen is secure.
JOE WEEKER	It's been contained in the onboard lab. Pittman's already running tests. I think you're going to be very satisfied.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	I hope so. Don't underestimate the value of that tissue sample.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Protect it with your life. Because if it doesn't make it back To the surface.
JOE WEEKER	lady, if that sample doesn't make it back, neither do I. And believe me, that cheetah chunk will be the least of my worries.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	You don't have to worry. As long as that specimen is delivered to me, your safety is guaranteed.
JOE WEEKER	And the deal's the same as before,
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	correct.
JOE WEEKER	Well, then we are crystal clear, babe. And I'm already taking the necessary precautions.
JOE WEEKER	PiCKman's going to be pissed.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	PiCkman isn't interested in riches.
JOE WEEKER	Well, then his loss is our gain.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Keep me updated.
JAMES PETERS	Something's not right here, Chris. There's some strange feeling. I don't know.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Just try to relax. It's nearly over.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We've been down here God knows how long. No one's ever been this deep.
JAMES PETERS	Okay, but maybe we were never meant to come here. Maybe nature never intended us to find this place.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Don't get hysterical on me, Jim.
JAMES PETERS	Have you seen anything down here? You know, heard anything? Things you shouldn't see. Things that couldn't be here.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Like what? None of this was meant to be here.
JAMES PETERS	Well, like when you went into the water. Why did you do that? Because you saw something, right? Something made you do it.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	No, I fell.
JAMES PETERS	No, you saw something. You chased after it. Like Sam floating in the water.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	No. Jim, what's wrong with you?
JAMES PETERS	Look, when I was out there, I thought I heard my dad over the intercom.
JAMES PETERS	His tapes, his old recordings are playing at the bottom of the fucking ocean. How can that be possible?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Listen to me. You didn't hear anything, okay? You panicked. We're all shocked. It's normal.
JAMES PETERS	I don't think any of this is normal. I just know I want to get home.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	We will. But I need you to keep it together, okay?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	I need you I’ll keep me sane until we're back on the surface. I can't do this alone.
JAMES PETERS	We came to the bottom of the ocean. None of us were ever entirely sane.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You did great out there. Your dad could never bring back this physical proof of things that people didn't believe existed.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	It's going to shock the world, Jim. You lived up to your name.
JAMES PETERS	Yeah, well, I worry that might not be a good thing.
GORDANS ATIKINS	We're 2 hours from the surface. Do copy? DP Control?
GORDANS ATIKINS	Come in, DP control.
CONTROL SCREENS	It's october 25, day three of the Peters Figment expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula.
CONTROL SCREENS	40 miles into the mountains, we've uncovered something extraordinary.
CONTROL SCREENS	Can't you hear that? It's speaking to us.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	What's happening out there?
JAMES PETERS	Wait. Chris, hang on.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Come on.
JAMES PETERS	GORDAN!
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Oh my god!
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Jim get it open.
JAMES PETERS	I can’t
JOE WEETER	Hold on.
JAMES PETERS	Put down the axe Jim.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Pickman’s in there.
JAMES PETERS	You’re not really gonna use that thing joe.
JOE WEETER	You open that fucking pressure doorthis whole ship fillswith water  at aspeed so fucking fast the liquid wouldcut your body in half! DROP IT!
JAMES PETERS	Are you just gonna let Pikmin die in there?
JOE WEETER	Pikmin's lost his fucking mind. Don't you get it?
JOE WEETER	This was his dream. To see those creatures, those ancient sea gods.
JOE WEETER	And if that's what he wants, I do not need to go down with him.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	He didn't even know these things are down here.
JAMES PETERS	Pickman knew. He knew what they were and he knew they were only sleeping
JOE WEETER	. Exactly. What do you think they found down in Antarctica? What do you think they've been searching for all these years?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	And he just let us wake them up?
JOE WEETER	Pickman did not spend all of this money for you two to have the adventure of a lifetime.
JOE WEETER	We were sent here with a clear objective. Get the tissue sample from the fucking water goblins, make it back to the surface and get filthy fucking rich.
JOE WEETER	So will you please both move away from the fucking pressure doors?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You think that specimen is going to make you rich? It's going to be harder than you think.
JOE WEETER	Oh, you think I'm scared of a couple of brainiacs?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	No, that thing is growing. You can go and look at it if you don't believe me.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	And I think it's having a strange psychological effect on our crew.
JOE WEETER	You fucking think?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	It doesn't just exist physically. It's in our minds. It's in our thoughts.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Joe, I don't know if you know this, but I have a son waiting for me back home. He's ten months old..
CHRISTINE HARRIS	And if I don't get back to him, if I don't see him again, I swear to fucking God, you'll die down here with me and it won't be pretty
JOE WEETER	I don't need to listen to this bullshit.
JOE WEETER	Wait. Don't Agitate it
JOE WEETER	Jim.
JOE WEETER	He's dangerous, Chris. There's nothing we can do.
JAMES PETERS	Gordon.
RADIO	Frozen in time and waiting for the thumb.
GORDON ATKINS	Jim my boy. Is he really you?
JAMES PETERS	Gordon maybe you should come downstairs and lie down for a while.
GORDON ATKINS	I always knew you would find me one day, Jimmy. They told me you would come, but I prayed.
GORDON ATKINS	I prayed that it wasn't true.
GORDON ATKINS	Don't be afraid, jimmy death is not the end
GORDON ATKINS	These are things I nevershould've known things nature neverintended for us to find!
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Sit down Gordon
JAMES PETERS	I don't think that's Gordon.
GORDON ATKINS	Show them Jimmy, show them the way home...back to the place they onceknew...
GORDON ATKINS	then, our insignificant racewill know, how I tried to warn them,how they left it too late.
JAMES PETERS	Get the fuck away from me. Gordon. Don't make me use this
GORDON ATKINS	when they awake. It is time for us to sleep.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	JIM
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Gordon!
RACHEL	That’s it We'Ve lost them.
CAMERON	Can't get a signal. There's nothing.
CAMERON	It's? It. Gordon, what have you done?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	GORDON!
JOE WEEKER	Gordon!
JOE WEEKER	What have you done.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	STOP! STOP IT! You’ll blow thewindows!
JOE WEEKER	It this thing's going down, sweetheart. Back down to the bottom of the ocean, and they are not going down with it.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You can't just leave us to pilot this thing.
JOE WEEKER	pilot what? It's scrap metal. Lady, open your fucking eyes.
JOE WEEKER	This thing is going down. I'm sorry about your kid.
JOE WEEKER	You gonna fight me now, bitch? Try it!
JOE WEEKER	you think we're just going to let you walk out of here, bitch?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	No, I don't.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Jim! Get in the rover. We've got to go.
JAMES PETERS	What?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Get in the rover.
JAMES PETERS	Where's Joe,.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Screw Joe come on we gotta go
JAMES PETERS	okay. Wait for me here. I'll be a second.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Well, where are you going?
JAMES PETERS	We can't risk someone else finding it. You know they'll come looking you.
JAMES PETERS	Whatever the hell you are. Time to make calamari.
JAMES PETERS	In a hurry jimmy.
JAMES PETERS	five minutes, this whole thing's goes under.
JAMES PETERS	This whole thing will implode when that door opens.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Jim we don’t have enough air supply
JAMES PETERS	That door’s set to open in fiveminutes, this whole thing’s gonnaimplode!
CHRISTINE HARRIS	What!
JAMES PETERS	One of us needs to stay behind to seal the pressure lock. Go on without me.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	No Jim we always said that
JAMES PETERS	Just go!
CHRISTINE HARRIS	JIM
JOE WEEKER	You can't destroy them, Jimmy. We woke them up and now it's all over.
JIM’S DAD	Jim
JIM’S DAD	Jim you came for me
JIM’S DAD	let's go together with them into the depths of oblivion.
JAMES PETERS	Dad?
FEMALE DOCTOR	Miss Harris. Miss Harris, can you hear me?
FEMALE DOCTOR	It's okay. You're safe. We're looking after you now.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Jim. Providence.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	They've gone.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	Miss Harris. After communication was lost, we picked up your rover signal.
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	They found you drifting. Your oxygen levels were dangerously low. You've been unconscious for a couple of days.
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You killed them. You knew exactly what we were going into. You fucking used us
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	neither of us got what we wanted, did we?
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	You knew the risks. No one must know what happened.
FEMALE DOCTOR	Miss Harris calm down
JULIA GOLDSTEIN	What's wrong with her?
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Oh no
CHRISTINE HARRIS	No no no no
CHRISTINE HARRIS	Congratulations Bitch
CHRISTINE HARRIS	You got exactly what you fucking wanted. No.
