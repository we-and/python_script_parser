EDEN	With all the complexity in the world, the noise, the pressure, you have to find peace. Your source of tranquility.

EDEN	And that is where the BLUE COSMOS SANDAL comes in. Made from earth-friendly materials, it's a win for your feet and the earth. Try a pair. The opulent comfort will surprise you. Take care of your sole, and your soul will soar.

REESE	Ah, thank you, Eden. Perhaps we should see how Mr. Grayson feels?

MR. GRAYSON	You don't understand our product.

EDEN	Um, I think I do...

MR. GRAYSON	Our customers like that we're simple and ecologically responsible.

MR. GRAYSON	You have it painted like it's some luxury bed for your feet.

EDEN	I thought comfort would be a key appeal given the steep price point 

MR. GRAYSON	We won't be using this.

EDEN	Um, well, is there another angle you prefer I try 

MR. GRAYSON	That's all.

REESE	Uh, Mr. Grayson 

REESE	Let me just say that we have a whole team committed to doing the best for your company....

EDEN	I researched, and researched, and ran surveys and everything, and Grayson's wrong. His customers are buying flip flops! They want something comfortable on their feet for cheap! That's all!

REESE	I'm glad you didn't tell him this.

EDEN	Why? Don't we want our clients to succeed?

REESE	We want them to be happy. And to be our clients still.

EDEN	Did they fire us?

REESE	No. I convinced them to stay and give us a second chance.

EDEN	Good. Look, I'll do what they think they want, even though

REESE	I'm giving it to someone else.

EDEN	Oh.

REESE	Look, Eden, you're bright and hard working. But lately, something's off. You're not connecting with the clients, and... it's like you lost your drive. You used to knock these pitches out of the park, with a passion to rival PT Barnum.

EDEN	I'll try harder.

REESE	It's not that you don't work hard. Maybe you need a change.

EDEN	Are you firing me?

REESE	No, no. I want you to take a break though. Take a week or two off, and recharge. Figure out what you need, and come back fired up.

EDEN	Um. Okay?

EDEN	What am I going to do?

KATE	Enjoy the time off.

EDEN	Sure, and conveniently ignore that my job's on the line.

MICHAEL	He didn't say that, did he?

EDEN	Michael, when your boss says your work isn't any good, and orders you to take time off, none of that's good.

KATE	You deserve a good vacation.

EDEN	Ugh. Like I'll be able to enjoy it when I'm worried about my career.

KATE	Take Michael with you.

EDEN	You could come with me.

MICHAEL	I wish I could. Things at work arecrazy right now.

EDEN	Tax season's over though.

KATE	Not really. Remember last year, howMichael was buried under all the late tax returns?

EDEN	Oh yeah.

MICHAEL	We have a huge increase in filing extensions this year for some reason too. I can't take time off right now.

EDEN	Okay.

MICHAEL	Speaking of, I should probably get back to the office.

KATE	Make sure you get home at some point.

MICHAEL	I'll call it a night around 10.

EDEN	Sorry.

MICHAEL	Thanks for dinner.

EDEN	Sure.

KATE	See you, Michael.

MICHAEL	Good night, Kate. Bye honey.

EDEN	Night.

KATE	You should go somewhere. I can keep an eye on things here, get your mail and all that.

EDEN	You're great.

KATE	What are neighbors for?

EDEN	I don't even know where I'd go.

KATE	What about somewhere you can clear your head?

EDEN	There's one place I can think of. Are you doing anything next week?

KATE	Other than hair appointments? No.

EDEN	We can get someone else to pick up the mail.

KATE	Where are we going?

KATE	This is your family's summer home?

EDEN	It was my grandparents' house but they willed it to my parents. We'd come every summer when I was growing up. I loved it. My parents remodeled it a couple of years ago.

KATE	But no one lives here right now?

EDEN	Not year-round. I called my mom and she said we could come and dust it off.

KATE	Feel free to call me to "dust" this place off anytime.

EDEN	I know. I hardly recognize it. I think the last time I was here was... before my freshman year of college? Has it been that long?

KATE	Do your parents come out here often?

EDEN	Not as often as they used to. I think they rent it out here and there.

KATE	Who's that?

EDEN	I don't know. No one else should be here.

KATE	Maybe he's a gardener?

EDEN	Excuse me. Can I ask what 

EDEN	Riley?

RILEY	Eden.

KATE	So, not the gardener.

EDEN	Ah, it's good to see you.

RILEY	You too.

EDEN	I wasn't expecting you here.

RILEY	I noticed one of the sprinkler lines here is broken. It's been gushing, and overwatering this spot, and anyway, I thought I'd fix it.

EDEN	That's nice of you, thanks.

KATE	I'm Kate. Eden's friend.

RILEY	Hi. Riley.

EDEN	Sorry. Yeah, Riley's family owned the cabin next to us and we would see each other every summer.

RILEY	So what brings you here?

EDEN	Uh, I ... needed a break. Kind of a forced vacation. The cabin was available so I went for it. And you? You're living here?

RILEY	Dad got tired of the winters and moved to Arizona. So I took over the cabin and started a business.

EDEN	That's great. What kind of business?

RILEY	Hot air balloons.

EDEN	You sell them?

RILEY	No, no. I do hot air balloon rides around here.

EDEN	Oh.

KATE	That's certainly different.

RILEY	It's a work in progress.

RILEY	Hey, well, I'll let you get settled.

EDEN	It was great to see you.

RILEY	Yeah. Nice to meet you, Kate.

RILEY	Sorry about the 

EDEN	Oh, no, it's fine. Thanks for fixing it.

RILEY	No problem.  I should be done with it in a few minutes.

EDEN	Thanks.

EDEN	We need to get some groceries tomorrow.

KATE	Sounds good. Riley seems nice. Did you see him a lot here?

EDEN	I did. I don't even remember how we became friends. I think it was convenience. He was next door every summer when we came and became the default friend.

KATE	Only a friend?

EDEN	Uh, why do you ask?

KATE	Just a vibe I got.

EDEN	It was so long ago. He was the reason I started looking forward to coming to Tahoe in my teen years, but that's history.

EDEN	Oh it's Michael.

EDEN	Hi.

MICHAEL	Hey, did you and Kate make it there all right?

EDEN	We did.

KATE	Hey Michael.

MICHAEL	So how is it?

EDEN	Good so far.

MICHAEL	Good! I hate to ask so soon, but when do you think you're coming back?

EDEN	Miss me already?

MICHAEL	I certainly do. Also, I need a haircut, and I forgot to get one from Kate before you left Kate, can you help me out?

KATE	I've got you covered. You'll be my first appointment when I get back.

MICHAEL	You're awesome. Thank you.

EDEN	How was your day? Crazy?

RILEY	Morning, Spencer.

SPENCER	Hey. The burner on this is good to go. Minor adjustments but it's solid.

RILEY	Good. Thanks. Any new reservations?

SPENCER	Ah, no. No messages, anyway.

RILEY	All right.

SPENCER	But we have one later this week, so...

RILEY	Yeah

SPENCER	Things will get better.

RILEY	Of course.

KATE	The water's gorgeous.

EDEN	Isn't it?

KATE	Lucky you, coming here each year. I'm surprised you stayed away.

EDEN	Not on purpose. Just work, life you know.

KATE	How are you feeling about work?

EDEN	Conflicted.

KATE	How so?

EDEN	Part of me is ... what's the word? Annoyed. Like, how can they question my work?

KATE	And the other part?

EDEN	It wasn't my best work. Lately, I...I care, but I don't enjoy it. So maybe... maybe I'm relieved.

KATE	I thought you liked it there.

EDEN	I don't know. I didn't think about that until Reese benched me.

KATE	It'll be fine when you go back, after you have time to recharge.

EDEN	It's still not my decision. Reese seemed supportive of me coming back, but only if I'm back on my game.

KATE	Mmmmm. It makes me appreciate what I do. Someone comes in, you cut their hair, done.

EDEN	Yeah, but you're good at it.

KATE	You're good at marketing.

EDEN	Am I? It's something I picked in college and then went for it. Part of me wonders what else I could have tried. Maybe I'm overthinking it. Isn'twork supposed to just be work?

KATE	Depends on what you want from it. A simple paycheck or do you want some fulfillment?

EDEN	That's the real question, isn't it?

KATE	Come on. Let's try out the water.

KATE	You don't have to have your life all figured out right now.

EDEN	It feels like I should have something figured out though, right? 

KATE	You have Michael.

EDEN	Yeah. Of course. But career is a big part too.

EDEN	Oh hey, there's this place you have to see around the corner. Mr. Webber's store you'll love it.

EDEN	This was my favorite hang-out in town. I'd always come in for a milkshake.

KATE	That sounds really good right now.

EDEN	I wonder if Mr. Webber still runs this place, or 

MR. WEBBER	Hello?

EDEN	Mr. Webber?

MR. WEBBER	Now don't you look familiar...

MR. WEBBER	Eden Clark!

EDEN	That's right.

MR. WEBBER	You're finally back.

EDEN	For a little bit.

MR. WEBBER	I haven't seen much of your family for some years. Not since your grandpa passed. How are your parents?

EDEN	They're good. They don't make it out here often though.

MR. WEBBER	And who's this with you?

EDEN	My friend Kate. I'm showing her Tahoe, and I was telling her this was my favorite place.

MR. WEBBER	Pleasure to meet you, Kate.

MR. WEBBER	Well, come over and order something. I already know Eden's favorite...Chocolate Brownie milkshake.

EDEN	It's the homemade brownies that you put in it.

MR. WEBBER	How about for you, Kate?

KATE	Um, I'll try a cookie dough shake.

MR. WEBBER	Sensible choice. All right then.

MR. WEBBER	I hope you'll stay a long while, Eden. I sure miss seeing the "old timers," as I call them. Feels like I'm a rare breed now.

EDEN	I'll try to come back often while I'm in town.

MR. WEBBER	I'll hold you to that.

MR. WEBBER	You ladies go grab a seat.  I'll bring your order right out.

EDEN	Thanks.

EDEN	Mr. Webber's place was the hangout for a lot of kids.

EDEN	I think he associates me more with my grandparents, but it never mattered that I was a summer visitor. He treated me like a local, like family.

KATE	I like him. The cookie dough wasn't bad either.

EDEN	Told you.

EDEN	Is that too much for the two of us?

KATE	Nah, should be fine. You know what we still need though?

EDEN	What?

KATE	Some onions and peppers.

KATE	Over there. I'll grab some.

EDEN	Okay.

RILEY	I thought you didn't like salad.

EDEN	That was when I was 12. It's not so bad now.

RILEY	Ah, I see. Still love bananas?

RILEY	Allergic now.

EDEN	No!

RILEY	It was a sad day when I had to give them up.

EDEN	Sorry. So what have you been up to?

RILEY	Let's see.... today I've fixed up things at the warehouse leaky pipe, flickering lights, those sort of things. It was a quiet afternoon business-wise. And now I'm restocking my kitchen.

EDEN	I didn't know you were a fix-it type of guy.

RILEY	Just call me Mr. Do-It-Yourself. Ithelps keep costs down.

EDEN	Ah.

EDEN	I was surprised you're still living here. I thought  when you were old enough, you'd leave and conquer the world.

RILEY	In all fairness, I did leave and try a slice of life elsewhere, but then I came back.

EDEN	Oh. Well, I'm glad to see you again.

RILEY	How long are you here for?

EDEN	Oh, a couple of weeks? It's a bit ... fluid.

RILEY	So you'll relax, read a book, swim, shop 

EDEN	That all sounds perfect.

RILEY	Oh, and hiking! You know what you have to do while you're here?

EDEN	What?

RILEY	Go to our spot.

EDEN	Our spot?

RILEY	The overlook.

EDEN	Oh.

RILEY	We should go together. You have to show your friend too she'll love it. What do you think?

EDEN	Let's do it.

KATE	What's so special about this overlook? 
EDEN	It's ... well, we'd go there every summer. It became a tradition.

KATE	We? You and ...

EDEN	Well, Riley and me.

KATE	Oh. So you'd just hike there?

EDEN	It's a pretty hike.

KATE	And...

EDEN	It's where we had our first kiss.

RILEY	We'd hike up here a couple times each summer when you visited, didn't we?

EDEN	At least.

KATE	The "view" must really be good.

RILEY	It depended on how noisy it got asEden's mom and grandma argued.

EDEN	They always fought over what was for dinner each night, and who would cook it, and how.

KATE	Like your mom does when she visits you?

EDEN	Don't remind me.

KATE	Hey, how much further? My feet are...well, I didn't bring the best shoes for off-road activities.

RILEY	We're almost there.

RILEY	Eden, Kate, come on!

KATE	Wow. I need to get out more.

EDEN	How are your feet?

KATE	Forgotten.

RILEY	Is it worth it?

EDEN	Just as I remembered it.

RILEY	Kate, what do you do?

KATE	I'm a hair stylist.

RILEY	That sounds fancy.

KATE	I cut and style hair. It's really not. But hot air balloons sound amazing. That's what you do, right?

RILEY	Yeah.

EDEN	That must do well here. I mean, what a great view to get of the lake, right?

RILEY	You'd think so. It's been a bit of a slow start. And it's a little pricey, so that makes it hard for the casual or budget-minded tourist.

KATE	But it's Tahoe! You come here to vacation and burn cash.

RILEY	People can come up here, hike like we did, and see the view. Maybe that's enough.

EDEN	You don't believe that, do you? A hot air balloon? That's unique.

RILEY	Well, yeah. But I can only run tours early in the morning, or in the early evening if I'm lucky. I'm starting to wonder if I need to do something else to live on and make this a side job.

EDEN	Why can't you run more tours?

RILEY	Temperature affects how well we can rise. Not to mention wind, which picks up as the day goes on.

EDEN	Tricky.

RILEY	But it is fun. You both should come see what it's like.

KATE	You mean in the air?

RILEY	Yes.

EDEN	That'd be fun.

EDEN	Did you know job listing sites are just scary?

KATE	Why are you looking at those?

EDEN	Just in case.

KATE	You weren't fired.

EDEN	Look at this. The job description is a full page. I feel like I need a special degree to understand what they're saying.

KATE	Probably not for you then.

EDEN	What if I get fired? I mean, going out there, finding a new job, interviewing? I hate all that.

KATE	I thought you were supposed to be decompressing here, not stressing yourself out about what-ifs.

KATE	Time to eat anyway.

EDEN	Thanks. It looks good.

KATE	So what are we doing tomorrow?

EDEN	What do you want to do?

KATE	There's this insanely over-priced spa. Maybe a massage?

EDEN	No thanks.

KATE	Why not? It'd help you relax.

EDEN	I don't like those. Having a stranger rubbing my body creeps me out. I end up feeling more uptight. But you should go ahead.

KATE	Hmmm. Fine, I'll save that for another day. Oh, what about the hot air balloon thing?

EDEN	Riley did text me that he has a last minute tour tomorrow morning. He said he has room for us if we want to go.

KATE	Want to?

EDEN	Yeah, that'd be fun.

RILEY	Looking good.

SPENCER	Yep. Our group is late though.

RILEY	Even so, here's the important part.

RILEY	Good morning!

KATE	You get up this early for every one of these tours?

RILEY	You two ready for this?

EDEN	I guess so. Where's the rest of the group?

RILEY	Good question.

RILEY	Excuse me. 

RILEY	Hello, Hot Air Tahoe?

EDEN	Wow.

KATE	Yeah.

SPENCER	Do you two want to step over here in the basket?

EDEN	Sure.

SPENCER	I'm Spencer, by the way. I work for Riley.

EDEN	Hi, Eden.

KATE	Kate.

EDEN	So what type of fuel is used to get this to fly? A sort of rocket fuel?

SPENCER	Nope, propane.

EDEN	You're kidding.

KATE	Like the stuff we use to grill?

SPENCER	The very same.

EDEN	Who would have thought? 

RILEY	All right. Bye now.

RILEY	Well, part of their group got sick. We rescheduled them for later this week.

SPENCER	Ah, come on.

EDEN	We can go another time.

RILEY	Nonsense. Everything's set up. Hop in.

EDEN	Who flies it?

RILEY	Me.

EDEN	You? Don't you need a license?

RILEY	I got one.

RILEY	You two okay?

EDEN	Sure.

KATE	Speak for yourself.

RILEY	Relax. Enjoy the view.

KATE	Is it safe up here?

RILEY	As long as I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

EDEN	Are you?

RILEY	I haven't crashed anything yet.

EDEN	What about wind? You said before that wind can 

KATE	Are you trying to make me more nervous?

EDEN	I'm just curious.

RILEY	I checked the expected weather conditions and we're fine.

KATE	Expected?

RILEY	Are you going to open your eyes at all?

KATE	How far off the ground are we?

RILEY	Uh, why don't you take a look?

KATE	Just give me a number.

RILEY	15?

KATE	Feet?

RILEY	More like yards, but it's not that high.

EDEN	You weren't kidding.

RILEY	Wait till you see the lake.

KATE	Are you, like, steering us over there?

RILEY	I'm doing my best.

KATE	Where's the wheel, or whatever?

RILEY	It doesn't quite work that way. But don't worry. I'll get us there.

EDEN	You really know how to fly this?

RILEY	Let's hope so!

RILEY	I got my pilot's license and was flying regional commuter jets.

EDEN	Really?

RILEY	You're surprised?

EDEN	You always said you wanted to fly, but we were kids then. Things change.

RILEY	That's true. It got to a point where I never felt at home. I was always in the air and detached from life. I've been happiest here.

RILEY	What do you think?

EDEN	All those years coming here I never saw it like this.

EDEN	I've always had fond memories of this place, but this this is the best.

RILEY	You'll love this then. Kate, hang on.

KATE	What?

KATE	Are we falling?

RILEY	This is the less impressive side of my little company.

KATE	Here, I can help 

SPENCER	These go over there.

EDEN	How long have you been in business?

RILEY	Almost a year.

EDEN	What's your favorite part about it?

RILEY	Floating in the balloon, just above the lake's surface. There is nothing as peaceful. It's... pure serenity.

EDEN	And the worst part of it?

RILEY	Making a living on it. I'll feel better when things takes off. No pun intended.

EDEN	You know, I can help with that.

RILEY	What?

EDEN	I work in marketing. And it sounds like you need more customers. The whole experience is amazing. It should nearly sell itself once enough people try it out.

RILEY	You're on vacation here though.

EDEN	I could use a chance to sharpen my skills.

EDEN	People can't even tell you're here.

RILEY	Most people call, so I give them directions.

EDEN	But you're on a main street with lots of traffic. Your building can be an advertisement.

RILEY	Sounds expensive.

EDEN	You don't have to do anything crazy, * but this place can work for you.

RILEY	I don't know how much difference it'll make.

EDEN	What have you tried, advertising wise?

RILEY	A poster here and there around town. I have a website too.

EDEN	We can do more. If you'll let me help?

RILEY	You sure you want to get into this?

EDEN	I want to help you.

RILEY	All right.	Sure.

KATE	So much for relaxing.

EDEN	It almost pains me though. I can see he can do so much more and make his business thrive. How can I sit back and ignore that?

KATE	I guess you really do like marketing.

EDEN	I want him to succeed. Kate finishes up with her nail polish and tightens off the bottle. 

KATE	So how do you plan to help?

EDEN	Well, for starters 

EDEN	 he could use some more photos and video on his website. Especially of that view, and the balloon launching.

EDEN	I bet we can get some social media buzz going too with some simple ads. I know he's nervous about spending a lot but I know some easy stuff that will get the ball rolling.

EDEN	He definitely needs a sign for his warehouse.

KATE	That sounds pricey.

EDEN	A banner might be enough for now.

KATE	Is that going to be enough though?

EDEN	You know how you always see a gazillion tour brochures when you stay at a hotel?

KATE	No, but I don't travel much.

EDEN	Guests look through those and plan out activities for their stay. We just need to get them to see Riley's Hot Air Tahoe.

KATE	Riley's going to owe you.

RILEY	I so owe you.

EDEN	No you don't.

RILEY	Yes, I do. This is amazing.

EDEN	I'm glad you like it. We can still make changes.

EDEN	I didn't want to put in a big order until you saw it for real.

RILEY	It looks amazing. Let's print it.

EDEN	Great!

RILEY	And then let me take you out to dinner.

EDEN	Riley, you 

RILEY	I'm serious. A 'thank-you dinner' is the least I can do.

RILEY	You never told me why you were taking a break from work.

EDEN	Oh. That.

RILEY	Unless you don't want to talk about it.

EDEN	It's not horrible or anything. I just... well, my boss told me to take some time off so I can come back and do my job better.

RILEY	Ouch.

EDEN	Sorry you asked?

RILEY	From what I've seen, you seem great at your job.

EDEN	I used to be. But I think this was easier for me because the stakes were... more important, than say, selling sandals.

RILEY	Ah. Hot air balloon tours are cooler than sandals, so I get it.

RILEY	Do you like marketing?

EDEN	I thought I did. You told me flying airplanes lost its appeal for you. I guess we all change.

RILEY	Maybe. Although, you haven't changed as much as I would have expected.

EDEN	No?

RILEY	I can still see the same girl next door. The girl who would steal my shoes out on my porch when they were left out.

EDEN	That was only because you'd stuff snails in mine.

EDEN	You always were a bit mischievous.

RILEY	And you always got me back.

EDEN	I couldn't let you win.

RILEY	Of course not.I remember my dad was crazy mad at you for something what was it? Oh! You burned his collection of baseball cards!

EDEN	I thought they were yours! Besides, you'd drawn all over my face with a marker when I was camping in the backyard.

RILEY	Yeah, that was pretty good.

EDEN	I was so afraid your dad was going to come after me for the burning thing. But he never confronted me about it.

RILEY	That's because I told him I'd done it.

EDEN	What? Why?

RILEY	I didn't want you to get into trouble. And, I was secretly impressed. You one-upped me.

EDEN	I guess I should be grateful.

EDEN	Do you ever wonder when it was that we started to grow up?

RILEY	Maybe when you stopped coming to Tahoe.

EDEN	Yeah.


EDEN	Thank you for dinner.

RILEY	My pleasure. I still owe you though.

RILEY	Have you been by Mr. Webber's?

EDEN	Of course. He still remembers my favorite milkshake flavor.

RILEY	Mine too.

EDEN	Bananas foster. Oh! Your allergy.

RILEY	I keep having to remind him so he doesn't get offended when I turn it down.


EDEN	Let's say hello. I'll trade your bananas fosters for my chocolate brownie if he unknowingly insists.

MR. WEBBER	You two have made my day. Just like old times.

EDEN	You work too hard here. Don't you have anyone to help?

MR. WEBBER	Oh, a couple of kids work shifts here and there. But this this is my pride and joy.

MR. WEBBER	And Bananas Foster for you.

RILEY	I always try to convince Mr. Webber to take a vacation.

MR. WEBBER	Where would I go that's better?

MR. WEBBER	Seeing you two back together again, well, it's the cherry on top.

MR. WEBBER	Ah. Welcome!

EDEN	Thanks for the milkshakes.

RILEY	Thank you.

EDEN	I wouldn't want you to go into some allergic shock here.

RILEY	More like I break out into hives, but still, not fun.

EDEN	So, no more bananas or bananas foster. No longer an airline pilot. What else has changed?

RILEY	I'm a terrible businessman, apparently.

EDEN	You just need some marketing tips, that's all.

RILEY	That's a kind way of putting it. Hmm, what more changed... I don't know. Maybe I'm the same at heart.

EDEN	Did you ever get married?

RILEY	Nope. I had a girlfriend, a few, I guess. One wanted to get married, but I realized... well, I didn't love her, so....

EDEN	Ah.

RILEY	What about you?

EDEN	Never married.

RILEY	Do you remember how we'd sneak out to the lake at night?

EDEN	Yeah.

EDEN	On the last night of our trip, the day before my family would drive home.

RILEY	We'd go to the dock and lay out to watch the stars. And we'd talk about 

EDEN	What we wanted.

RILEY	And what worried us, anything on our minds. Like starting a new school year, arents fighting, 

EDEN	Gossipy friends back home 

RILEY	Yeah. I remember you wishing more than once that you could stay in Tahoe forever.

EDEN	Me too.

RILEY	I miss those talks.

EDEN	Me too. Kate, you ready?

KATE	Yes. Want me to grab you a drink?

EDEN	I filled up a water bottle. I'm good.

KATE	How was your dinner with Riley?

EDEN	Good.

KATE	Kind of seemed like a date.

EDEN	No. No, it's not like that.

KATE	Was it ever? You said you two kissed.

EDEN	That was one time when we were 17 or something.

KATE	Okay. I'm just... I don't know. You two seem close.

EDEN	There were a lot of summers. I mean, sure, we liked each other but we * never dated. Really it was just anging out as teens, and when we were younger, playing on swing sets and monkey bars.

KATE	Okay. Just wondering.

EDEN	It's Riley.

KATE	What's he want?

EDEN	He's wondering what we're doing today.

KATE	Do you want to invite him along?

EDEN	Sure. I'll text him back.

RILEY	You know the problem with living here?

KATE	What?

RILEY	You don't take enough time to enjoy everything that's great about it.

EDEN	True. It's like me going to the beach back home.

KATE	You never do.

EDEN	Yep. Because it's always there.

RILEY	We better make sure you appreciate this while you're here.

RILEY	You have sunblock on your face.

EDEN	You bet I do.

KATE	There's a line of it. On your cheek.

EDEN	Oh.

EDEN	Should I get that?

KATE	No.

EDEN	Be right back.

KATE	Can you explain something to me?

RILEY	I'll do my best.

KATE	I grew up in the same house my whole childhood, and even now I don't live far from it. But I can't tell you the name of more than 3 kids I knew back then.

RILEY	What's the question?

KATE	Why are you and Eden so close?

RILEY	I don't know if we still are. But we were, when she was here. Maybe it was... There was this one year.

RILEY	We were... 12? Thirteen at the most. For her, it was her summer vacation trip, something she looked forward to. She showed up, went straight to the beach, stayed out all day, and was a lobster by night.

KATE	Really? So that's why she lathers up on sunscreen like crazy?

RILEY	Because she got burnt till she blistered. Her mom forbade her from going outside the rest of the week, until she recovered sufficiently. Eden could hardly move. I didn't want her to be bored. So I brought over games, ice packs, treats, oh and milkshakes from Mr. Webber's, and I kept her company. Honestly, it was one of my favorite summers. Whether that's the reason we're close or not, I don't know for sure, but... She was always a good friend.

EDEN	Hi.

MICHAEL	Hey honey.

EDEN	Sorry I missed your call. I was out on the water.

MICHAEL	The water, huh? Are you and Kate having fun?

EDEN	Yeah, we are.

MICHAEL	All play and no work.

EDEN	Actually, I am sort of working. I'm helping out a... neighbor with promoting his business.

MICHAEL	Good for you! Just don't overdo it.

EDEN	I won't. What's going on there?

MICHAEL	Well, I've got good news.

EDEN	Oh yeah?

MICHAEL	My boss came to me today and told me I'm being recognized internally at the firm.

EDEN	That's great! Recognized how?

MICHAEL	The annual company dinner is coming up, and they always do some awards and what not. This year, I get one, along with a nice little bonus.

EDEN	That's amazing! You so deserve it. Congratulations.

MICHAEL	The dinner is at the end of next week. Do you think you can make it?

EDEN	Of course.

MICHAEL	Good, you and Kate will be back from your trip by then?

EDEN	I'll make sure I am. I'm so proud of you.

MICHAEL	Thanks. I miss you.

EDEN	Miss you too.

MICHAEL	Have fun at the lake.

EDEN	I will. Bye.

MICHAEL	Bye.

RILEY	Thanks for inviting me.

EDEN	Glad you could come.

RILEY	See you tomorrow?

EDEN	I'll bring by the flyers from the copy shop.

RILEY	Sounds good.

KATE	He's nice.

EDEN	Yeah.

KATE	Is he dating anyone?

EDEN	Not that he mentioned.

KATE	Does he know you're dating Michael?

EDEN	No. It's... it doesn't matter because we're just friends.

KATE	So your relationship with him, it's simple  nostalgia?

KATE	What's Michael then?


EDEN	Michael's... wonderful. Supportive. Grown-up. Don't you think?

KATE	Yes, I agree.

EDEN	Then what's the problem?

KATE	Nothing.

EDEN	Let's just enjoy the trip here.

KATE	Okay.So you're saying your feelings for Michael aren't changing?

EDEN	Correct.

KATE	And your feelings for Riley?

SPENCER	Wow. You're getting serious about this now.

RILEY	Let's hope.

EDEN	Here are addresses of places we can leave the flyers.

EDEN	Mention my name in case they look at you funny, but I've talked to all these places so we should be good to leave these there. If you have friends with businesses, maybe you can ask about putting one up in a window.

SPENCER	My cousin runs a bakery.

RILEY	Best donuts.

SPENCER	Right?

EDEN	Perfect. I've got my list 

EDEN	So...

RILEY	Let's get going.

EDEN	This is a good one.

EDEN	Enjoy.

RILEY	Thanks for letting me put this up.Have a good day!

RILEY	You beat me here.

EDEN	I figured Mr. Webber would be very supportive. He says you owe him.

RILEY	Did you finish then?

EDEN	Yup. You?

RILEY	Pretty much.

EDEN	I wonder how long it'll take to see if this is working. I do have some online ads scheduled to start running. I need to check on those stats 

RILEY	Whoa, calm down. It'll be fine.

EDEN	I haven't been this anxious about an ad campaign's performance in a long time.

RILEY	I doubt that.

EDEN	I'm serious. I want this to do well for you.

RILEY	Well, relax. The rest is out of your hands. In fact, maybe it's time you get your mind off work any work.

EDEN	How?


EDEN	We never had chairs out here before.

RILEY	I don't know about you, but my back probably 

EDEN	Just like old times.

RILEY	Yep.

EDEN	I like being able to see the stars again.


RILEY	You don't get that back home, huh?

EDEN	No.

RILEY	Sometimes I come out here, by myself.It's not the same.

EDEN	It's probably quieter.

RILEY	True. But quiet is overrated.

EDEN	It never feels quiet back home.

RILEY	You can always come back here then.

EDEN	I guess so.

RILEY	You should come here more often. I've missed this.

EDEN	Me too.

RILEY	Do you ever think about the last time you were here?

RILEY	We went on the gondola.

EDEN	I remember. My stomach didn't like it.

RILEY	I thought about that when we went on the hot air balloon ride. I wasn't sure if it was a heights thing.

EDEN	More a rocking back and forth thing.

RILEY	Afterwards, we went on a hike.

EDEN	To our favorite spot.

RILEY	Yeah. It was overcast that day. But I was determined we'd go. I wanted to see...how you felt about me.

EDEN	We kissed. That stayed with me for...awhile.

RILEY	Me too.

EDEN	When I went back home, I ... I wrote you a letter.

RILEY	You did?

EDEN	I never sent it. But I thought about

you.

RILEY	What did the letter say?

EDEN	Oh, you know.

RILEY	Come on. Tell me.

EDEN	I wrote that I wished I lived here and wasn't far away, so I could see you more. It said that I ... missed you.

RILEY	I've missed you.

RILEY	And I've wished, every time I've come out on this dock, that I could see you more.

KATE	You kissed him?

EDEN	Does that make me a horrible person?

KATE	o, of course not. But you need to come clean.

EDEN	What? Why?

KATE	Because he deserves to know.

EDEN	Are we talking about Riley or Michael?

KATE	Both.

EDEN	Yes, we kissed but it was a spur of the moment thing. I'm with Michael, and Riley is...

KATE	What? What is he?

EDEN	A nice memory. But it can't lead anywhere.

KATE	Do you want it to?

KATE	Look, you're all conflicted about should you have or should you not have kissed him, but the fact is you did. You don't know what you want 

EDEN	I didn't say that 

KATE	And that's fine, but you can't move forward without letting go of Riley or Michael.

EDEN	I...I don't have anything figured out. I feel more confused now than when I came. I still don't know what's up with my job, and ... I'm a mess.

KATE	No, you're not. But if you don't figure this out, you will be.

SPENCER	Hey, Mr. Webber called for you.

RILEY	He did? 

SPENCER 	I have things here under control, but you better go see him. He said it was an urgent freezer emergency, and he was calling in a favor.

RILEY	All right....

MR. WEBBER	The ice cream is no good like this. More like soup.

RILEY	When did the freezer quit?

MR. WEBBER	I came in this morning and tried it out, only to get this runny mess.

RILEY	Well, let me see what I can find.

RILEY	Huh. It's drawing power. Could be something with the compressor. Or maybe some wiring somewhere else.

MR. WEBBER	I hope I don't have to replace the whole thing. I had to replace the stove two years ago.

RILEY	I'll do my best.

MR. WEBBER	No pressure on you, Riley. I'm just talking to myself. I'm sure grateful you could come out.

RILEY	Happy to.

MR. WEBBER	I didn't interrupt your day too much, did I?

RILEY	No, quiet morning.

MR. WEBBER	Oh. Those flyers I keep seeing everywhere aren't working?

RILEY	Not yet.

MR. WEBBER	Hmm. Make sure to enjoy the quiet times. Things will pick up and you'll be wishing for them.

RILEY	Thanks.

MR. WEBBER	You see much of your neighbor?

RILEY	Yes, we've spent time together.

MR. WEBBER	You should take her on a proper date.

MR. WEBBER	All I see is people "hanging out." Never understood that term since it makes you sound like a bunch of onkeys in a tree.

RILEY	It's less risky that way.

MR. WEBBER	Nothing risked, nothing gained. I always thought you two suited.

RILEY	Well, we never took that step. Our lives went in different directions.

MR. WEBBER	And have ended right back here.

RILEY	For now. It's temporary.

MR. WEBBER	You want it to not be so "temporary," don't you?

MR. WEBBER	Get to it then.

MR. WEBBER	Oh! You fixed it!

RILEY	Is this what is normally sounds like?

MR. WEBBER	Yep!

RILEY	Okay then.

EDEN	Hey Kate?

EDEN	"Gone for that massage. I'll be back in time for dinner.  Kate."

EDEN	Reese. What do you want while I'm on my forced vacation?

EDEN	"...Hope your break is going well.... Could use your perspective on a project when you have a moment....Looking forward to you coming back."

EDEN	Not yet.

MICHAEL	Eden! Hi.

EDEN	Hi. Sorry, am I interrupting?

MICHAEL	I have a few minutes. How are you?

EDEN	I'm okay.

MICHAEL	Uh oh.

EDEN	I guess it's a good thing. Um, Reese emailed me. It sounds like he wants me back.

MICHAEL	Fantastic!

EDEN	Uh, yeah.

MICHAEL	So are you coming back sooner?

EDEN	Um, I'm trying to decide. It's been nice out here.

MICHAEL	I bet.	Tahoe sounds like a great place. Well, I say take whatever time, but don't forget about my company dinner.

EDEN	Right. No problem. I'll be back for it.

MICHAEL	Thanks. Hey, and great news about Reese. I knew it would work out.

EDEN	Yeah, it's it's good. Um, anyway, I'll talk to you later.

MICHAEL	Thanks for calling.

EDEN	Yeah. Bye.

MICHAEL	Bye.

EDEN	I need to get out.

EDEN	When did we get these?

EDEN	Thanks for coming with me.

RILEY	Happy to.

EDEN	I don't know when my parents got these. This wasn't really a thing when we were kids.

RILEY	You're making us sound old.

EDEN	It looked neat, and I figure I'm here, so I should try it.

RILEY	I'm glad you called me.

EDEN	Don't tell me; you do this every weekend.

RILEY	Nope. Every other weekend.

EDEN	What's the secret?

RILEY	Trust yourself?

EDEN	Gee, thanks.

RILEY	Tighten your stomach? I think that's supposed to help your balance.

EDEN	Okay, I think...

EDEN	I think I got it.

RILEY	Good. Then use the oar to move around.

EDEN	This is so cool.

RILEY	You're never going to want to go back.	

EDEN	I got an email from my boss today.

RILEY	And?

EDEN	He's asking for my input on things. And he said he's looking forward to me coming back soon.

RILEY	Oh. Isn't that good?

EDEN	Yeah, I guess it is good. It's always good to be missed, but ... I'm finding I don't miss it. At all.

RILEY	Maybe it's time for a career change.

EDEN	Too scary.

RILEY	I did it. So can you.

EDEN	You're still flying.

RILEY	And you can still market. But I don't know if you actually want that. What do you like to do?

EDEN	It's not that I don't like marketing. There's a thrill to it sometimes, or a pride I take in it....

RILEY	ow so?

EDEN	Like when I figure the best way to bring out what makes something great. It's a puzzle, but when it comes together...

RILEY	You do like marketing.

EDEN	I think I'd miss it.

RILEY	So what's wrong? Is it what you're working on?

EDEN	You always do better at something if you believe in it, so that could be it.I wish I had time to figure it out.

RILEY	So tell your boss you're not ready.

EDEN	Then I risk him rethinking and firing me. And if I'm not sure...

RILEY	You don't want to let go of one branch without a grip on another one.

EDEN	Exactly.

RILEY	As I see it, you have three options.

EDEN	I do?

RILEY	Yep. First one, go back to your old, unexciting job.

EDEN	Next option please.

RILEY	Second, come work for me as a poorly paid marketer.

RILEY	Hey, I'm all for you sticking around here.

RILEY	Can't blame me for trying.

EDEN	And the third option?

RILEY	Do nothing.

RILEY	Take your time. You don't have to make a choice now or next week.

EDEN	I do have to make a choice eventually.

RILEY	But when you're ready, and when you've had time to possibly discover new options.

EDEN	If the hot air balloon thing doesn't work out, you could be a career advisor.

RILEY	Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

KATE	What's going on?

EDEN	What? Nothing.

KATE	What did you just read about?

EDEN	Ah....

EDEN	Chess? Fine, I don't know.

KATE	Come on, tell me.

EDEN	It's nothing.

KATE	Really?

EDEN	I'm just thinking.

KATE	About?

EDEN	If I tell you, you're just going to lecture me.	

KATE	I don't do that!

KATE	Seriously, I won't. I promise.

EDEN	Fine. Riley kind of...insinuated he wants me to stay here.

KATE	Wow. Gutsy. Is that even tempting?

KATE	It is?

EDEN	It shouldn't be, right? I have my life back home, my job sort of and what he's saying is a huge change.

KATE	Not just job and home, but...relationship-wise too.

EDEN	I know. And that's crazy. Michael is 

KATE	Amazing, supportive, stable?

EDEN	Exactly. Why would I let go of that?

KATE	You have to decide before this gets out of hand.

EDEN	It's not that bad.

KATE	Yet. But someone is going to get hurt.

EDEN	You worried about me?

KATE	More about Riley or Michael. Michael's going to be heart-broken.

EDEN	Riley was talking about deciding what I want for my job, and he said I don't have to make a decision. Maybe it's the same here. I need to put this aside and just enjoy the time we have left here.

KATE	It sounds like good advice but you still have to be careful not to hurt them. Or yourself. Okay?

EDEN	Okay.

SPENCER	And the card's expiration date? All right, you're set for Monday, party of 5. Yes, sure thing.  See you then.

RILEY	Party of 5?

SPENCER	The phone's been ringing all morning. We have every day booked for the next two weeks.

RILEY	Are you serious? That's amazing!

SPENCER	Your friend really got things rolling. I'm going to get things prepped for tomorrow's tour.

RILEY	Hot Air Tahoe, can I help you?

EDEN	Thanks.

RILEY	Guess how many calls we had yesterday?

EDEN	How many?

RILEY	Thirty-three  no, it was more than that. I lost count. I haven't had to answer the phone that often per hour, ever.

EDEN	But are people booking?

RILEY	Yes! That's the crazy thing! I'm starting to wonder if we should raise prices.

EDEN	You probably could, but wait for a bit. I don't want this to be an initial rush with no continued traffic from customers.

RILEY	Look at you, talking all business-like.

EDEN	Have you set up appointment booking online?

RILEY	I asked Spencer to, six months ago. It's not going well.

EDEN	I'm going to send you a link for a site that handles that. It's very affordable and saves you from having to answer the phone all day.

RILEY	Excellent.

RILEY	What are you working on?

EDEN	Web ads. What do you think?

RILEY	It looks....

EDEN	What?

RILEY	Legitimate.

EDEN	Well, good, because you are.

RILEY	I feel professional, and I'm not even doing the work. You are.

EDEN	You won't want to run the same ad all the time though, so I'm giving you a few options.

RILEY	What for?

EDEN	To change it up for seasons, holidays, stuff like that.

RILEY	Got it.

EDEN	There you go.

RILEY	I don't know what I'm going to do without you.

EDEN	I think you'll do fine.

RILEY	I'd rather not find out. Any chance you'll stay?

EDEN	You can get anyone to help you with this stuff. Don't worry; it's not like your business will lose out.

RILEY	It's not my business I'm worried about losing.

RILEY	So what do you have planned for the rest of your stay here?

KATE	I have new clients coming out of nowhere, trying to get on my schedule. I'm going to have to work 10 hours a day when I get back.

EDEN	Hey, it's good to be in demand, right?

KATE	I guess. I'm still dreading it.

EDEN	Me too. When are your next appointments?

KATE	Monday. Are you going back to work then too?

EDEN	I'm still figuring that out.

RILEY	Okay, all set.

SPENCER	I'm going to bed early. I've been used to sleeping in.

RILEY	I'd say I'm sorry but no sleep means work and a paycheck.

SPENCER	I'll take it.

RILEY	Eden mentioned we should do something to encourage customers to leave reviews.

SPENCER	Like a follow-up email or something? Or we could give out a free t-shirt for every good review?

RILEY	Bribery probably isn't the best way to go. I'll ask her for some ideas on that.

SPENCER	Is she staying?

RILEY	I don't know. I'd like her to, but...

SPENCER	What?

RILEY	It's ... too early to tell.

SPENCER	You two dating?

RILEY	Too early to tell.

SPENCER	Sounds like you have a lot to clear up.

SPENCER	See you bright and early.

RILEY	Yeah, thanks. See you, Spencer.

KATE	This is about done.

EDEN	Great 

EDEN	I got it.

EDEN	Michael?

MICHAEL	Eden.

MICHAEL	I kept thinking about your call, and about Tahoe and seeing you, and it dawned on me: why not come for the weekend at least?

EDEN	I'm... glad you're here.

EDEN	Riley.

KATE	Michael!

MICHAEL	Hi Kate.

EDEN	Um, hey, this is Michael. My boyfriend.

MICHAEL	Hi.

RILEY	Good to meet you.

MICHAEL	Nice flowers.

RILEY	Yeah. They're for Eden, and Kate, as a thank you for their help with my business.

MICHAEL	Oh, you're the neighbor Eden's been helping.

RILEY	Uh, I guess so.

KATE	You didn't have to do that.

RILEY	I know, but... yeah.

KATE	Um, dinner's ready.

MICHAEL	Oh great. I'm starving.

MICHAEL	Nice tan!

KATE	Thanks.

RILEY	I just wanted to drop those off.

EDEN	Riley, I didn't know 

RILEY	The response to the flyers and everything has been great. We're getting more business. So, thanks.

EDEN	Riley 

RILEY	You have company. Goodnight, Eden.

MICHAEL	Is everything all right?

EDEN	Sure.

EDEN	You were right.

KATE	I'm sorry.  don't like being right.  At least not with this.

EDEN	Do you think I should tell Michael about Riley?

KATE	I think you could.

EDEN	I don't want to hurt him too.

KATE	I think he would understand. But...it's more urgent you talk to Riley. EDEN	I should have told you about Michael. I didn't mean to keep that from you.

RILEY	I don't have any right to be upset. It's your life. And...we're just old friends.

EDEN	You're more than that.

RILEY	But not enough.

EDEN	That's not true.

RILEY	Isn't it?

RILEY	It's okay. It's... I've enjoyed seeing you again.

EDEN	Me too.

RILEY	And my business   I think I have a real shot now, thanks to you.

EDEN	I'm glad. I ... thanks for letting me help. And for being my friend.

MR. WEBBER	Here you go.

EDEN	Thanks.

MR. WEBBER	Better get that to Riley before it melts.

EDEN	Oh, it's not for him.

EDEN	I'm going to miss these.

MR. WEBBER	So you're leaving?

EDEN	Yeah. It's been wonderful, but too bad it's just temporary.

MR. WEBBER	Not all of it is temporary. How you feel here that stays with you.

EDEN	I should let you go.

MR. WEBBER	Eden.

MR. WEBBER	If you go back, what do you leave behind here?

EDEN	Thanks, Mr. Webber.

EDEN	How are all the tax deadlines?

MICHAEL	I'm chopping away at them, bit by bit. It's nice not to be in the office. Breath of fresh air, and all that.

EDEN	Yeah.

MICHAEL	I should have come sooner.

MICHAEL	You asked and I made excuses.

EDEN	You're busy. I understand that.

MICHAEL	But I was talking to Kate, and she helped me see how upsetting the last couple of weeks have been for you.

EDEN	I don't know if I'd say upsetting...

MICHAEL	Nerve-wracking? Either way, I should have been here.

EDEN	Oh.

MICHAEL	What is it?

EDEN	Reese. He wants to make sure I can attend an all-hands meeting Tuesday.

MICHAEL	Wow, he really wants you back. He's seen what life's like around the office without you and doesn't like it. I'm so glad this all worked out.

EDEN	Me too.

EDEN	This is everything, right?

KATE	Yep. I double-checked. Even under the furniture.

EDEN	You're thorough.

MICHAEL	Ready?

EDEN	Yeah, I just need to lock up.

RILEY	Hey.

EDEN	Hi. We're leaving. Work and all....

RILEY	So you're going back to it?

EDEN	Yeah.

RILEY	I hope it works out then.

EDEN	Thanks.

EDEN	I should go.

RILEY	Next time you come, you should stop by the shop. You can see if we're following your advice well or not.

EDEN	I definitely will. Goodbye, Riley.

RILEY	Bye, Eden.

MICHAEL	Want me to drive?

EDEN	Uh, sure. Thanks.

REESE	All right, I know we normally divide up assignments here, and we'll get to that but I want to start with some news. Good news.

REESE	We've just signed two brand new clients: Castle Vacuums and MinFloral Air Freshners.

REESE	Right? This is great for us.

REESE	They're eager to hit the ground running, so let's get to work ASAP. Bobbi 

REESE	You're going to oversee Castle Vacuums. And Eden 

REESE	You up for MinFloral?

EDEN	Absolutely.

REESE	Excellent.

EDEN	Come in!

MICHAEL	Hey. How was work today?

EDEN	Good.

MICHAEL	Did you cook?

EDEN	A new client's product. MinFloral * Air Freshner.

MICHAEL	MinFloral?

EDEN	I think it's because the scent is pure minerals, added with floral scents. I at first thought "Min"referred to "mini," but this isn't that small.

MICHAEL	Interesting.

EDEN	Yeah.

MICHAEL	So, I wanted to plan out Friday's dinner.

EDEN	What time is it at?

MICHAEL	For once, I'm thinking I should be early, so would you mind if I picked you up at 5:30?

EDEN	I'll be ready.

MICHAEL	Great.

EDEN	What's the dress?

MICHAEL	I'm wearing a suit and a new tie.

EDEN	A new tie, even!

EDEN	I'll make sure I don't embarrass you then.

REESE	How's it coming together?

EDEN	Good. The market survey I put together comes back tomorrow. It'll help fine-tune what I'm going to present.

REESE	I can't wait to see it.

MR. WEBBER	Riley. How are you?

RILEY	I wanted to check on that freezer. * Is it working all right?

MR. WEBBER	Ever since you fixed it. It mighthave a few years left, thanks to you.

RILEY	Good.

MR. WEBBER	What can I get you?

RILEY	Oh nothing, thanks. I was just passing by and wanted to check in.

MR. WEBBER	How's that business going? I keep seeing your balloon floating around in the mornings.

RILEY	It's been popular lately.

MR. WEBBER	Good, good. Have you heard from Eden?

RILEY	Um, no. Not since she went back home.

MR. WEBBER	You could call her, you know.

RILEY	I think she's moved on. I'm her past.

RILEY	And that's okay. As long as she's happy.

MR. WEBBER	You're a good kid, you know that?

KATE	Are you nervous about the pitch?

EDEN	No. Not really. Maybe I should be, because then I'd come across as excited about it.

KATE	I'll admit, air fresheners are pretty dull.

EDEN	Yep.

KATE	Could you ask Reese for a different assignment?

EDEN	It was this or vacuums.

KATE	Wow.

EDEN	It's fine. It's work, right?

KATE	You know, you could still make a change.

EDEN	What do you mean?

KATE	You know... quit your job.

EDEN	I can't.

KATE	You just... You don't seem happy to be back.

KATE	And maybe it's not just because of the job.

EDEN	Imagine. You feel the migraine coming on. The weight of the world is constantly on your shoulders. But whether you're at work or at home, MinFloral can be a sanctuary and a shield. Let the natural mineral aromas lift your spirit, invigorate your body, and ward off the stressors that come from every direction.

EDEN	In an array of award-winning and inventive scents, MinFloral is the element you're missing to feel stronger and renewed.

EDEN	MinFloral. Mineral Ingredients. Floral Scents. Fresher life.

VIVIAN	I like it. What type of ad campaigns do you see being most effective for MinFloral?

EDEN	The standard for the air freshener industry is print-based, but I think that's outdated. I want to get you on video in the coupon and shopping apps, as well as targeted campaigns in the online and broadcast space. Targeted to your demographic, of course.

VIVIAN	I love it. One question though. I don't think the hot air balloon fit.

EDEN	Oh.

REESE	Eden?

EDEN	Ah, that's easy to leave out, but I was going for a parallel of the fresh open air, like when you're in a hot air balloon.

VIVIAN	Oh.

REESE	All ads will get your final approval before we run, so don't worry about anything that seems out of place.

EDEN	Right.

VIVIAN	Okay.

REESE	If we hurry, we can get these locked in while ad inventory is high. I think we'll be able to negotiate better placements now rather than waiting for too long.

VIVIAN	That sounds sensible.

REESE	You had me slightly worried with the hot air balloon thing, but you handled it great.

EDEN	Thanks.

REESE	There's a lot to do in a short time on MinFloral, but I think you can do it if you're willing to put in some extra time. And then I have a plantfertilizer client that I want to assign to you.

EDEN	Plant fertilizer?

REESE	The landscape and gardening industry's number 3 company. They're aggressively trying to take the lead.

REESE	So, I'll add that to your accounts.

EDEN	Actually....

EDEN	Maybe you should give that to someone  else.

REESE	What do you mean?

EDEN	I mean... maybe you should give allmy accounts to someone else.

MICHAEL	Hi 

EDEN	I just walked in the door. I'm so sorry; I'll hurry.

MICHAEL	Okay.

MICHAEL	The freeway's going to be a mess right now. I think we can make up the time on another route.

EDEN	Good.

MICHAEL	Long day at work?

EDEN	Sort of. I quit my job today.

MICHAEL	You did?

EDEN	Yep.

MICHAEL	Are... are you all right with that? That's kind of sudden, isn't it? What are you going to do?

EDEN	I don't know yet. But I wasn't happy.

MICHAEL	Maybe you should think it over. You could talk to Reese again Monday.

EDEN	No, it's fine. Really.

MICHAEL	Okay. If you say so.

MICHAEL	 I didn't know your job made you so unhappy.

EDEN	I don't think it's just my job though.

MICHAEL	What do you mean?

MICHAEL	All this time...

EDEN	know. I think you're an amazing friend.

MICHAEL	You are too. I guess we weren't really in love with each other.

EDEN	It was comfortable.

MICHAEL	And we let it go on.

EDEN	Yeah.

MICHAEL	When did you figure this out?

EDEN	Since I've been back, but... I guess it started in Tahoe. There was this friend there. Riley.

EDEN	And I realized what I felt for him was different than what I feel for you.

MICHAEL	Ah.

EDEN	You're not upset, are you?

MICHAEL	No. I have something to tell you too. You and I started dating but as it went on, we spent time with each other's friends. A lot of time, and I started to ...
EDEN	Kate!

MICHAEL	Yeah. And I couldn't bring myself to tell either of you. I would hate myself if that ever got between you two. You're such good friends.

EDEN	I get it. But I want you, and Kate, to be happy.

MICHAEL	You do?

EDEN	Definitely.

MICHAEL	This day has gone very differently than I thought.

EDEN	For me too. Oh!

EDEN	The dinner!

MICHAEL	It's okay 

EDEN	You can still make it.

KATE	Eden! What's going on?

EDEN	Go put on a nice dress.

KATE	What? Why?!

EDEN	Because you're going to a dinner party to honor Michael.

KATE	What I am?

EDEN	Yes.

MICHAEL	Hi Kate.

KATE	Michael. Eden, seriously, what 

EDEN	There's not a lot of time, but to sum it up, Michael and I broke up, and Michael has secretly loved you for awhile now, and as I think about it more and more, you love him too, and I couldn't be happier for you both.

KATE	What?!

EDEN	Think about it. Even in Tahoe, you were worried about me, yes, but you didn't want Michael to get hurt. You've been an amazing friend to me. But I don't want you to miss out on something special with him.

EDEN	Speaking of special his company dinner thing started five minutesago. 

MICHAEL	What do you think, Kate? Will you come with me? Be my date?

KATE	What will you do?

EDEN	I have no idea. Don't worry about it.

MICHAEL	Eden....

EDEN	Go. Have fun.

RILEY	You all have a good day.

RILEY	Fine. No wind really.

SPENCER	Good.

RILEY	Did the no-show come while we were in the air?

SPENCER	Nope. I guess they forgot.

SPENCER	Who's that?


RILEY	If it's the no-show 

SPENCER	Maybe they got the time wrong.

RILEY	Wait...

EDEN	Did I miss the tour?

RILEY	That was you?

EDEN	I drove as fast as I could to get here.

RILEY	Sorry. You missed it.

EDEN	That's too bad.

RILEY	You know, normally there's no refunds, but... maybe I could take you up for a private tour another day, if you're going to be in town for awhile.

EDEN	I am. And I'd like that. Maybe I'll even leave you a good review.

RILEY	I didn't think you were coming back.

EDEN	It's like you said; I needed time to figure it out, for myself.

RILEY	And have you?

EDEN	I think so.

RILEY	I'm glad. Because I didn't want to wait another 10 or 15 years to see you again.

EDEN	Me neither.

EDEN	I had two resorts here contact me about running a marketing push for them.

RILEY	I'm not surprised.

DEN	I think I'll pick one of them to work on.

RILEY	Good for you.

EDEN	Nice, huh? This working for yourself idea isn't bad.

RILEY	See why I like it?

EDEN	Yes. I do.

EDEN	 really do.
