GARY	I went to a hotel.  I'm sorry.	
ANDI	So you're gonna force me to represent her?	
GARY	No, no.  Look, I'm--I'm not forcing you to do anything.	
ANDI	Well, I asked you to go home to make nice.	
GARY	I can't.	
ANDI	So you want me to represent her?	
GARY	Look, I won't say anything, okay?	
ANDI	You want me to represent her to win but not hurt you too bad?	
GARY	Andi, hmm, no.	
ANDI	Well, just tell me what you want me to do.	
GARY	This is wrong.	
ANDI	No, no, no.  I've--I've been thinking about it.  Just tell me what you want.	
GARY	No, you--your friends are here.	
ANDI	Oh, they're talking.  You know how women are.  They can wait a second.	
KAREN	I hear the weakness in her voice.	
DANNI	That's it.  If he goes and put a kiss again, we got to go out there.	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	Tell me.  Tell me.	
GARY	We can, uh, we can just talk about this later.

GARY	Look, what man who wants their ex to have anything?	
ANDI	But that's not you, I mean, you have kids, right?	
GARY	I know.  But…	
ANDI	And you're a decent man.  So, why not give her half and $50,000 a month?	
GARY	Andi…	
ANDI	That's fair, right?  I mean, you make a hundred thousand dollars a month.	
GARY	Before taxes.	
ANDI	Tell me what you think is fair?	
GARY	Look, I'm not comfortable doing this with your friends here.	
ANDI	But I wanna talk.	
GARY	No.  Just, you know, go on and just--we'll talk later.	
ANDI	Are you sure?

DANNI	Girl, it was brilliant.	
KAREN	It was.	
SABRINA	I wish I had what you have.	
ANDI	Really?  Because I'm tried.  I'm sick of this shit.  I'm sick of having to be strong because a man wants me to be weak.  I'm sick of playing these games.  I am sick of being a fool for love.  I'm looking at this  tell me lies and I'm taking it because I want it to be true.	
KAREN	We got you.	
ANDI	(sniffles) Why can't they just tell the truth?  Why can't they just let us be who we are?	
KAREN	I know.  I know.  I know.  We got you, okay?  You know we got you.	
DANNI	It's just the hand that we're dealt, girl.  What else can we do?

KAREN	Danni, we not giving dick slack right now, okay?  It's not the time.	
DANNI	Okay.  Okay.  Look, Jerome doesn't call me, you know, he ain't call me in forever.  He only calls me when he wants something and you're right.  I go broke giving all these […] money.	
ANDI	(clicks tongue) Well, at least you didn't fall in love with a married man who's dating several women.	
DANNI	Great.  You're right about that, I didn't do that.	
KAREN	Oh my God, girl.	
DANNI	(sniffs) I didn't.

SABRINA	No.	
ANDI	We're out of wine.	
SABRINA	That was some good	
ANDI	Wasn't it?  He always brought me the best wine.  (sniffs)	
SABRINA	What is going on with that by the way?	
ANDI	What?	
KAREN	Right.  Him just walking in like that.  Huh, what's up with that?  Why he just come back like that?	
ANDI	Well, I can't let him know I know.	
KAREN	Is that your phone buzzin'?  That's him?

SABRINA	Limited friends?	
DANNI	Limited friends?	
KAREN	Limited friends?	
SABRINA	What's that mean?	
KAREN	Is that like a…	
ANDI	Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Basically I told him to go home for a month and make nice with his wife until she retracted the divorce then I'd be in the clear.  But he played me, he just wanted me to represent her.	
DANNI	Why though?	
SABRINA	So that she could protect him.	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
KAREN	And burn his wife in the process.	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	I don't know.  This is a little elaborate.  Are you sure?	
ANDI	I mean, that's what the private detective said.	
DANNI	Well, Andi, you are so much better than being with a married man.	
ANDI	I know.  I know.  I know.  But he blindsided me, I mean, he came over, he told me he left her.  He said he wanted to be with me but then he got there and I was like this ain't right.  I just want him to fix it, you know, and his wife, oh.  She's so sweet.  I don't wanna think about it anymore, I just…	
DANNI	You're just in love.	
ANDI	Yeah.  I do love him.	
DANNI	I know.	
KAREN	Well, that's over.	
ANDI	No it's not.

KAREN	Okay.	
ANDI	I just need to think.	
KAREN	You're gonna do it.  You always do it.  No worries.	
DANNI	If I may play devil's advocate.	
KAREN	You're the devil.  How you gonna advocate for him?	
SABRINA	She didn't mean that.	
KAREN	Yes, she did.  Don't speak for her.	
ANDI	What were you gonna say?	
DANNI	Maybe it's just payback for sleeping with a married man.	
KAREN	Danni.	
DANNI	Look, all I'm saying is we had a no married man policy, broke it.	
KAREN	And you've had several.	
DANNI	I didn't know though.	
KAREN	Oh, the wedding picture on the nightstand wasn't--wasn't a giveaway?  Wasn't an indication?	
SABRINA	I was high.	
KAREN	(scoffs) I'm sitting here like a damn doorknob.	
ANDI	Enough.	
KAREN	Okay.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry Danni.  Y'all were right, I need to learn how to--how to speak less harshly.	
SABRINA	What?  Harshly?	
KAREN	Yeah.	
SABRINA	You got that at the Source App?	
ANDI	Where did that come from?	
KAREN	(sigh) Can you stop being a lawyer?	
ANDI	(gasps) Oh, Mr. Grocery Store, he said that.	
SABRINA	Who's that?	
ANDI	This man she met at the grocery store.

ZAC	I just love you.  Like, this time of us not being together really just made me think about myself and all my […] like, I wanna be better.  Like, I wanna do more, I wanna make more money.  I wanna help with the bills, like, I wanna do all of that.	
KAREN	I know.	
ZAC	Do you?	
KAREN	(sigh) Yes, I do.	
ZAC	Because I've been trying, but you know where I'm from.	
KAREN	That I know.	
ZAC	(sucks teeth) All that […] about me with that hoe, man, that ain't had nothing to do with you, you know?  I promise you.  I promise you, if you just give me another shot, I'll never hurt you again.	
KAREN	You can't promise me that, Zac.	
ZAC	Well, I--I promise, I can promise you that.	
KAREN	You might do something that just…	
ZAC	Oh, you know, what?  You're right.  You're right.  But if I do something like that ever again, I can promise you, it will be an accident, it will not be because of a woman.	
KAREN	What about a man?	
ZAC	What?	
KAREN	Never mind.  I'm sorry.	
ZAC	Where is that coming from?	
KAREN	Sabrina's going through something.  Forget I said that.	
ZAC	Well, whatever Sabrina going through that ain't got nothing to do with us, like--so just, please, just let me try.	
KAREN	I promise I'm gonna watch the way that I talk to you.	
ZAC	You ain't got to do that, like, this--this ain't about you.  This is about me.	
KAREN	We both have things that we can work on, Zac.	
ZAC	That's fair, but you ain't never cheated on me, did you?	
KAREN	No.	
ZAC	Exactly.  I know that and you will never do that.  That's why I love you.  And I promise you, this is a new me, I--I promise, this is a new me.  Pull over.	
KAREN	(scoffs) What?	
ZAC	Pull over.	
KAREN	Zac, Zac, no.	
ZAC	Come on.  Come on.	
KAREN	We're almost home.  Stop.	
ZAC	I can't wait.	
KAREN	You can't wait?	
ZAC	No.  You can't wait either. See?  You pulled over, though.	
KAREN	I'm just trying to see…	
ZAC	Meet me in the back.	
KAREN	Zac!	
ZAC	Meet me in the back.  Come on.	
SINGER	Maybe I should start building sand castles because it always feels like the current is coming in.  Oh, yeah.  Lately, it's been tough trying to impress you.  The same way you told me that it's the end.  Maybe I should spend more time hanging with the friends that I came with because I can't quit thinking about you, no.  Baby, I spent all my life trying to build what's right in front of me, how dumb of me, because now the waves are coming in.  Yeah.	
SABRINA	Good morning.	
MAURICE	Oh.	
SABRINA	What?	
MAURICE	How are you?	
SABRINA	I'm good.	
MAURICE	And how was last night?	
SABRINA	It was good.	
MAURICE	What happened?	
SABRINA	Nothing.  I just--I had to leave early.  One of my girls had a problem.	
MAURICE	No, ma'am.	
SABRINA	What?	
MAURICE	He told me.	
SABRINA	Told you what?	
MAURICE	He told me he hit that ass, girl.  (chuckles)	
SABRINA	What the hell?	
MAURICE	What?	
SABRINA	So what is he doing?  Just calling you and y'all talk like girls?	
MAURICE	What is that supposed to mean?	
SABRINA	I mean, why is he calling you and telling you that we had sex?	
MAURICE	He didn't.  But you just did.  I'm so good.	
SABRINA	Damn it.	
MAURICE	Uh-hmm.  So how was it?	
SABRINA	It was good.	
MAURICE	Really?	
SABRINA	He's amazing in bed.	
MAURICE	That is so messed up.	
SABRINA	What?	
MAURICE	Why--why can't I get that?	
SABRINA	Maurice, what do you mean?	
MAURICE	I know he a freak.	
SABRINA	What makes you say that?	
MAURICE	He walk like a freak.	
SABRINA	How can you tell?	
MAURICE	I know he just put it anywhere, don't he?	
SABRINA	He puts something everywhere.	
MAURICE	Wait.  What?	
SABRINA	Do not tell a soul.	
MAURICE	Tell me	
SABRINA	He found my toys.	
MAURICE	You mean toys like, "grrr?"  Oh, shit.  I got turned on.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.	
MAURICE	Girl, where he put it?	
SABRINA	There.	
MAURICE	On you?	
SABRINA	Uh-uh.  On him.	
MAURICE	Oh, my God.	
SABRINA	Shh!	
MAURICE	Girl, I love it!	
SABRINA	Stop, stop!  I just never been with a straight man who likes that.	
MAURICE	Do you know how many straight men I've been with who likes that?	
SABRINA	No.	
MAURICE	A plethora.  Uh-hmm.  So we still on this, Sabrina?	
SABRINA	Maurice, I'm just--I'm just trying to figure this out.	
MAURICE	Here's what you should do.	
SABRINA	What?	
MAURICE	I have a friend, he's bisexual.  Invite him over to dinner.  Invite Calvin.  See if he's interested.	
SABRINA	Interested in what?	
MAURICE	A threesome.	
SABRINA	I'm not doing a threesome.	
MAURICE	You don't have to.  All you need to do is see if he's into it.  If he goes forward, then you know what you're dealing with.  If he doesn't, then you know he just likes toys.  Grrr.	
SABRINA	All of this is complicated.	
MAURICE	Do it.  My friend's name is Javier, he's cute.  I'll give him a call if you want me to.	
SABRINA	No, no, no, I don't know, I don't know.  Hold on.	
MAURICE	Let me know when you find out.	
SABRINA	Hi.  May I help you?  How are you today?	
KAREN	Hey.	
ANDI	Hey.	
KAREN	How's it going?	
ANDI	(panting) I don't think she's coming.	
KAREN	Why?	
ANDI	Because they aren't here yet.	
KAREN	What time were they supposed to come?	
ANDI	(panting) Fifteen minutes ago.	
KAREN	Well, maybe he talked her out of it.	
ANDI	I sure as hell hope so.	
KAREN	But if he hasn't…	
ANDI	I don't know.	
KAREN	Have they called?	
ANDI	No.  I haven't heard anything.	
KAREN	Girl, just hope for the best.	
ANDI	Look, hoping for the best is good, but I need a plan B, girl.	
KAREN	I can call Aaron.  He can pray for you.	
ANDI	Are you really joking right now?	
KAREN	I'm sorry, okay?  Damn.	
ANDI	(sighs) You know, what?  When they get here, I'm just gonna see what they know.	
KAREN	You think that the private detective told her?	
ANDI	I don't know why she wouldn't.	
KAREN	Well, let's hope that Gary made up with her.	
ANDI	Now that I can hope for.	
KAREN	You okay?	
ANDI	(sighs) Yeah.  Wait.  Why are you so happy?	
KAREN	I'm not.	
ANDI	Is Zac over there?	
KAREN	No!	
ANDI	Oh, stop lying.	
KAREN	Girl, he's in the living room.	
ANDI	Oh, so you moved your living room into your bedroom?	
KAREN	Andi, stop.	
ANDI	Uh-huh.  It's okay if he's over there.	
KAREN	You think so?	
ANDI	Hell he is already.	
KAREN	Okay.  Fine.  He's here.	
ANDI	Geez.	
FATIMA	Ms. Barnes, Jasmine Borders is here.	
ANDI	Okay.  Looks like they're here.  Send them in.  Bye.  Hi.	
LESLIE	Hi.	
ANDI	Hi, Ms. Borders.  How are you?	
JASMINE	So you're the bitch my husband?	
ANDI	Next on Sistas.	
JASMINE	You are the lowest kind of low there is.	
ANDI	Is that you?  Is that not you?	
GARY	Andi, you have to let me explain.	
SINGER	I'm feeling freaky, we wanna get freaky.	
ZAC	This is what I call a little breakfast in bed.	
KAREN	I love it.	
ZAC	And I love you.	
SABRINA	You don't think the whole vibrator thing is a little weird?	
DANNI	Well, you know, that has never happened to me.	
SABRINA	Damn.	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	You're the freak of the group.  And if you've never really tried it, then, hmm…	
SINGER	Freaky.
