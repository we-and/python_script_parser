(THOMAS & FRIENDS)
(EARL’S QUIZ)
(BABY AND COUPLING)


EARL OF SODOR		Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching.? ...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen. Goodness me, what a lot of noise! And it's coming from that pram! I wonder if The Fat Controller can help... Ahh, well maybe not! But Thomas has another idea... He thinks a nice trip along the tracks might make the baby and its mother feel more relaxed. Are you ready for the first question? What colour was the baby's pram? Was it yellow? Was it green? Or was it blue? The baby's pram was blue! Now, that was a good idea, Thomas! Mother and baby are having a well deserved rest! And you can enjoy your journey in peace! Hooray! That was fun. Let's play again! Engines need to be attached to their cargo so it can't run away. Oh dear. Those trucks are being very troublesome! Thomas is backing up to his cargo. He's being 'coupled' to the trucks with hooks and links. That way his cargo can't run away from him! How are engines usually attached to their cargo? Are they stuck with glue? Tied with a rope? Or coupled with hooks and links? Engines are coupled with hooks and links. That means they can safely deliver their cargo. Even if they are pulling the Troublesome Trucks! Oh, jolly well done for playing! I look forward to seeing you again next time. Goodbye!
