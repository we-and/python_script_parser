GARY	You are an incredible woman.	
NARRATOR	Previously on Sistas.	
GARY	Actually, if I can do my life all over again, once I met you, that would be it.	
ANDI	I love you.	
GARY	I love you too.	
SABRINA	Do you wanna come over tonight?	
CALVIN	Do you want me to?	
SABRINA	Calvin.	
CALVIN	Either you're with it or you're not.	
SABRINA	With what?	
CALVIN	With me, the way I am.	
ZAC	I know this looks bad.	
SABRINA	'Cause it is bad.	
DANNI	Actually, it was good.  We had sex last night.  (smooches)	
ANDI	So you represent Ms. Borders?	
LESLIE	Yes.	
ANDI	Have you found anything interesting?	
LESLIE	Yes.  Very. I think we have a lot to talk about.  So you're her lawyer?	
ANDI	Yes.	
LESLIE	Wow.	
ANDI	Just a moment. Does she know about this?	
LESLIE	No.	
ANDI	When are you gonna tell her?	
LESLIE	I wanted to give you an opportunity to explain.	
ANDI	And why would I do that?	
LESLIE	Do you want me to give these to your client?	
ANDI	No, I don't.	
LESLIE	So then why don't you explain?	
ANDI	Why would I explain anything?	
LESLIE	I'm just trying to understand.	
ANDI	What do you want?	
LESLIE	What makes you think I want something?	
ANDI	Your body language.  It says, "I have all the power and I want something."  So tell me what you want.	
LESLIE	What if I told you I just wanted to help you.	
ANDI	Why would you do that?	
LESLIE	Because I think the situation you're in is really jacked up.  I got to admit, at first, I was a bit confused, then I got it, he is a slick son of a …but you do got to admire a man who could have an affair with a divorce attorney, manipulate his wife into seeking her counsel, and walk away winning.	
ANDI	That's not what happened.	
LESLIE	Why don't you enlighten me?	
ANDI	By?	
LESLIE	So you really don't know, do you?	
ANDI	Know what?	
LESLIE	(scoffs) Son of a […] makes me so mad.	
ANDI	What are you talking about?	
LESLIE	This--my firm is making a killing off women like you.	
ANDI	Can you just leave, please?	
LESLIE	You're being played.	
SINGER	All my girls on me now, and them boys mess around.  And my love life is a headache.  We're going out tonight because I'm looking for love.	
ANDI	What?	
LESLIE	You're being played.	
ANDI	What are you talking about?	
LESLIE	Sister.	
ANDI	I will not be blackmailed if that's what you think you're gonna do.	
LESLIE	I'm not trying to blackmail you.	
ANDI	Well, it sure as hell looks like it.	
LESLIE	Look, I'm sorry.  I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot here.	
ANDI	You think?	
LESLIE	Okay.  I'm not the enemy, he is.	
ANDI	Ms. Leslie.	
LESLIE	That man is playing you, girl.	
ANDI	Would you get the hell out of my office now?	
LESLIE	This woman, this is Tina Rogers, she's been seeing him for three months, he sees you in the morning before he goes to the gym and he sees her every afternoon for lunch.  See, I think he knew you were a divorce attorney.  He knew his wife was gonna file and he wanted you to have control of the divorce.  I'm sorry.	
ANDI	I was referred to Jasmine from one of my clients.	
LESLIE	Hmm.  That he knows.  Look, I'm really sorry to have to tell you like this and I'm sorry for me coming in here but as I've gotten to know more about you and him, I've come to know that you really are a good person, you just got caught in the middle of this.  Now I'm scheduled to meet with Ms. Borders this evening, at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning, she wants to meet me here and she wants me to show both of you everything I have and you got about 24 hours to figure out what you wanna do.  Call me.  Sorry.	

MAURICE	Hold on.  Let me sit down.  
SABRINA	You all right?	
MAURICE	What?	
SABRINA	What's wrong with you?	
MAURICE	Girl…	
SABRINA	Never mind, don't tell me.	
MAURICE	You ought to know it's because of your man that I'm walking this way.	
SABRINA	Will you stop it?	
MAURICE	No, I am.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Maurice, I'm eating.	
MAURICE	I'm talking about the squats.	
SABRINA	I didn't know you all worked out together.	
MAURICE	We don't.	
SABRINA	Well then, why were you at the gym?	
MAURICE	It was the first time.	
SABRINA	He invited you to work out?	
MAURICE	Well, I told him I wanted an ass like him and he told me, "Meet me at the gym."  So I did.  And now I'm paying for it.	
SABRINA	You told him you wanted an ass like his?	
MAURICE	Yes.	
SABRINA	How do you know what his butt looks like.	
MAURICE	Girl, you showed me the picture.	
SABRINA	Oh, yeah.  Wait, did you tell him that?	
MAURICE	Uh, of course not.  No, no, no.	
SABRINA	Maurice.	
MAURICE	No, no, no, I didn't.  But hell, look at him, he's always wearing things to show off his ass.	
SABRINA	When you told him that, what'd he say?	
MAURICE	Girl, he said it's his best asset.  He's proud of it.	
SABRINA	Really?	
MAURICE	Yes, girl.  He is proud of it.	
SABRINA	Oh, okay.	
MAURICE	What?  Are we still judging the man?	
SABRINA	Maurice, are you sure he's not gay?	
MAURICE	Who am I supposed to be, the gay detective?	
SABRINA	Yes, that's your job.	
MAURICE	(exhales) Well, he is suspect in getting to know him better, he does do some things that make me say, "Hmm."	
SABRINA	About what?	
MAURICE	Listen, I'm just gonna listen to what the man says he is and if he says he's straight, then he's straight.	
SABRINA	Well…	
MAURICE	I don't know no gay man who wants to be with a woman.	
SABRINA	Maybe he's bisexual.	
MAURICE	Girl, what?	
SABRINA	No.  Jake told me.	
MAURICE	Jake?  Jake, the spin class instructor?	
SABRINA	Yeah.	
MAURICE	What does she have to say?	
SABRINA	Well, he was saying that Calvin is gay.	
MAURICE	How would that girl know?  She having sex with that seat on that bicycle every day.  I can't stand that nosey bitch.	
SABRINA	Well, I mean, if that's what she was saying, then…	
MAURICE	Listen, I'm not gonna do this with you anymore.  If you don't wanna … with the man, then don't … with him.  If you do, stop asking questions and another thing, the bisexual thing, even if he is, what, does--does it even matter if he's committed to you?	
SABRINA	Yes.	
MAURICE	Why?	
SABRINA	I don't want him sucking the same things I suck.	
MAURICE	Well, at least your lips will taste the same.	
SABRINA	Maurie, go back to work.  Lunch is over.	
MAURICE	I would if my ass wasn't hurting so bad.  I need another 30 minutes.	
DANNI	All right.  Here you go.  Thank you for flying Higher Airlines.	
ZAC	Danni, I got to talk to you.	
DANNI	What?	
ZAC	Over here.	
DANNI	What?  You--you want me to go in the break room?  Have another wild night?	
ZAC	I've been sick all day.  Please.	
DANNI	Hmm.  Too much to drink?	
ZAC	No.  About last night.	
DANNI	Why is that?	
ZAC	I've been--I was out of my mind, all right?  And I shouldn't have done that, I was mad at Karen, now I'm mad at myself.	
DANNI	(clicks tongue) Well…	
ZAC	No.  Wait.  I like you.  I really do, okay?  But I never would've slept with you if I wasn't high.	
DANNI	Zac, you said you liked me.	
ZAC	I said a lot of things, I don't know why I said them, but this whole thing is making me crazy.  I don't--like, I don't even know what's going on.  I don't even know why I cheated on Karen, do you know?	
DANNI	No.	
ZAC	Exactly.  Karen is a good girl.  She don't deserve this, like, I know she make me feel like shit sometimes, right?  But that's not a her thing, that's a me thing.  You know what I'm saying?	
DANNI	You know, you're a confused little man.  Little, little man.	
ZAC	What--what do you mean by that?	
DANNI	You don't know what you want.	
ZAC	Oh, I--I know that.	
DANNI	Like, you really need to just grow up.	
ZAC	I know that, too.  But that's--that's why I came over here to tell you that I'm sorry and I'm--I got to move out.	
DANNI	If you say so.	
ZAC	Yeah.  I say so.	
DANNI	Okay.	
ZAC	And I know I just got to do better, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over to her house…	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.	
ZAC	I'm gonna tell her exactly what I wanted to tell her the other day.	
DANNI	Oh, well, you're--uh, you're gonna talk to her?	
ZAC	Yeah.	
DANNI	Hmm.  What are you gonna say?	
ZAC	Everything, like, everything.  I'm letting it all out.	
DANNI	Hmm.  You're gonna tell her about us?	
ZAC	(inhales) I kind of have to.	
DANNI	Okay.	
ZAC	You know she's gonna be mad, right?	
DANNI	I don't care.  She's always mad.	
ZAC	It's--it's true.  I'm sorry about all of this.  I am.	
DANNI	Yeah, yeah.  Okay.	
ZAC	I'm gonna come by and get my stuff.	
DANNI	Okay.  Ciao.	
SABRINA	Hello.  Sabrina speaking.	
CALVIN	Wow.  So formal.	
SABRINA	Yeah.  Well, this is my work phone.  I'm at work.	
CALVIN	It's all good.  Listen, I have a showing right near your house at 8:00.  Customer wants to see the place at night.  Thinking I could bring over some Chinese food?	
SABRINA	Um…	
CALVIN	(into the phone) Don't say no.  I--I think we need to talk.	
SABRINA	Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that's a good idea.  We should talk anyway.	
CALVIN	So I'll see you tonight?	
SABRINA	Okay.  I'll see you tonight.	
CALVIN	(into the phone) Okay.	
SABRINA	(on phone) Okay.	
MAURICE	Was that him?	
SABRINA	Did you tell him to call me?	
MAURICE	Yes, I did.	
SABRINA	Maurice, why the hell would you do that?	
MAURICE	Well, I'm ready for you all to put that to bed.	
SABRINA	Damn.	
MAURICE	Look.  What is the problem?	
SABRINA	I like him.	
MAURICE	Then go for it.	
SABRINA	It's not that easy.	
MAURICE	Just talk to the man.	
SABRINA	Hmm, but I can tell he gets offended.	
MAURICE	Who gives a shit if he gets offended?  Don't you want to know if you're wasting your time?	
SABRINA	I already asked him.	
MAURICE	Well, you obviously don't believe him.	
SABRINA	Are you done?	
MAURICE	No.  But I hope that you are.	
SABRINA	You have customers.	
MAURICE	I know I have customers.  Those… can wait.	
SABRINA	Your paycheck can't.	
MAURICE	Oh, oh.	
SABRINA	Go to work.	
MAURICE	Oh.	
KAREN	Who's next, Jennifer?	
AARON	Me.	
KAREN	Damn.	
AARON	Hi.	
KAREN	I have a customer.	
AARON	Not for the next hour or so because I booked you.	
KAREN	You think this is funny?	
AARON	No.  Do you?	
KAREN	I think this is stalking.	
AARON	Oh, come on.	
KAREN	Look, I told you to stop showing up unannounced.	
AARON	I just wanna talk to you, okay?  I wanted to apologize.  I wanna tell you I'm sorry.	
KAREN	Do it over the phone.	
AARON	Then answer my calls.	
KAREN	If I'm not answering, that means I don't wanna talk to you.	
AARON	Why are you being so hard?  Hmm.  You know you like me.	
KAREN	Hmm, I don't like your arrogant ass.	
AARON	Okay.  Fine.  Look, I'm sorry.  Can I please take you to dinner tonight?	
KAREN	What are you sorry for?	
AARON	I should have recognized that you were upset, I didn't give you a moment to calm down, and I shouldn't have judged the way you were talking to him when I don't know your situation.  So, come on.	
KAREN	When you show up, that wife of yours…	
AARON	Ex-wife.	
KAREN	Shows up and I don't want or need any of that drama.	
AARON	She won't bother you.	
KAREN	How do you know?	
AARON	Look, she'll be fine.	
KAREN	I don't know.	
AARON	Just dinner.	
KAREN	(sighs) Will you remember your wallet this time or you will have to call her?	
AARON	(exhales) Ouch.	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.	
AARON	I'm sorry about that.	
KAREN	You know that was real awkward, right?	
AARON	(scoffs) It was.  Look, I told you.  I don't know how to do this, okay?  Am I forgiven?	
KAREN	I'm sorry for the way that I spoke to you.  It seems that a few people have told me that I should watch my tone.  And if you say, "I told you so," I'm putting you out.	
AARON	Not a word from me.	
KAREN	Good.	
AARON	So, dinner?  Nice restaurant?	
KAREN	Hmm.	
AARON	Hmm?	
KAREN	No.  You can come over, I'll cook.  I'm not ready to be with you in public yet.	
AARON	(chuckles) Deal.  Now, can you, uh, clean me up a little bit?	
KAREN	Oh, no, I don't do guys.	
AARON	You don't?	
KAREN	Hair.  Phil!  Phil, can you cut him?  Okay.  He'll take care of you.	
AARON	Okay.	
KAREN	No problem.	
AARON	Thank you, my lady.	
JENNIFER	Zac is here.	
ZAC	Hey.	
KAREN	What do you want?	
ZAC	I see you're still talking to old boy.	
KAREN	You have great timing.	
ZAC	(scoffs) Can I talk to you?	
KAREN	I got nothing to say to you, Zac.	
ZAC	In private?	
KAREN	No.	
ZAC	Listen, I--I really need to talk to you.	
KAREN	Why?	
ZAC	You're gonna make me talk here in front everybody?	
KAREN	Right here.  You living with Danni?	
ZAC	I'm moving out today.	
KAREN	Why?	
ZAC	'Cause it ain't right.  Come on.  Can we just go in the back?  Just…	
KAREN	No.	
ZAC	Come on, Karen.  I just--I wanna just open up, tell you everything.	
KAREN	Why?	
ZAC	There's still some things I think you should know.	
KAREN	I don't care.	
ZAC	Can we please just go in…	
KAREN	No.  We're done, okay?	
ZAC	Can we just go in the back…	
KAREN	Did you not hear me?  I said I'm not talking to you, okay?  Now, leave before I embarrass you.	
ZAC	(clicks tongue) Yeah, you're good at that.	
KAREN	We're not gonna keep doing this, Zac.  You're not gonna upset me.	
ZAC	You're just gonna throw away all what we had?	
KAREN	Yeah.  Throw it away.  Throw it to that hoe that you were sleeping with.	
ZAC	I told you…	
KAREN	Boy, bye, okay?  Bye, bye, bye.  Go ahead, get on your bike, and go.	
ZAC	Oh, that's funny?  It's funny?	
KAREN	Zac.	
ZAC	(scoffs) Okay.	
ANDI	This is Andi.  Leave a message.	
KAREN	Hey, where the hell are you at?  Call me back. Hello?	
SABRINA	Hey.	
KAREN	What's up?	
SABRINA	Uh, where's Andi?	
KAREN	(into the phone) I have no idea.  I tried to call her.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Um…	
KAREN	What is it?	
SABRINA	Look, I know you told me to talk to Jake about Calvin.	
KAREN	Yes.	
SABRINA	And Jake is saying that he's gay.	
KAREN	Okay.  Well, there's your answer.	
SABRINA	Yeah.  But Maurice is saying that Jake is lying.	
KAREN	Maurice?	
SABRINA	Okay.  Okay.  I know.  Look, I'm so confused.  He asked me to have dinner tonight.	
KAREN	Okay.  Well, just tell him.	
SABRINA	Uh, I don't know if he's gonna like that.	
KAREN	That don't mean you shouldn't say it, okay?  Look, Zac just left here.	
SABRINA	He did?	
KAREN	Yes.	
SABRINA	What did he say?	
KAREN	That he wanted to talk in private, to tell me everything, to confess.	
SABRINA	What did you say?	
KAREN	(into the phone) I kissed his ass out.  I wanna hear none of that.	
SABRINA	So he didn't tell you?	
KAREN	No.	
SABRINA	Oh.	
KAREN	(sighs) Look, just let him and Danni do whatever it is that they're doing over there, okay?	
SABRINA	You know what?  A customer just walked in.  So let me call you back, okay?	
KAREN	Okay.  Look, let me know if you talk to Andi, okay?	
SABRINA	Okay.  I will.	
KAREN	All right.  Bye.	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	(on phone) What do you got going on?	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	Can you stop with the hostility?  Do you know what's going on with Karen and Zac?	
DANNI	Oh, um, he's gonna tell her about us.	
SABRINA	Will you stop it?	
DANNI	I don't know what he's gonna say.  He said he was gonna talk to Karen and (scoffs)--I don't care.	
SABRINA	Girl, are we really doing this?	
DANNI	Look, I'm at work.  So…	
SABRINA	(into the phone) Girl, you never do anything anyway.	
DANNI	See, that's what you […] talk about behind my back, huh?  I don't do anything but I'm a supervisor?	
SABRINA	You know what?  You need to stop smoking weed.  You get so paranoid.	
DANNI	You […] talking about me behind my back is what's making me paranoid.	
SABRINA	Danni, please, can we not do this right now?  I'm really trying to avoid this not getting worse.	
DANNI	I don't care.	
SABRINA	Danni.	
DANNI	(sighs) Um, yeah.  You know what?  I'm gonna hang up.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Fine.

CALVIN	Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	How's your day?	
CALVIN	It's going well.  I can't complain.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.  Do you want something to drink?	
CALVIN	Not right now.	
SABRINA	Okay.
CALVIN	You like?	
SABRINA	The question is, do you like?	
CALVIN	I got to say, a little freeing.	
SABRINA	I like them.	
CALVIN	Do you like it?	
SABRINA	(chuckles) What are you doing?  Uh-uh.  I thought we weren't doing this.	
CALVIN	Shut up.	
ANDI	This is Andi.  Leave a message.	
KAREN	Andi, where the hell you at?  I've been calling you all day.  Look, I need you to talk me off the ledge right now.  Zac came to the salon looking how he looks.  I just--I'm so damn horny, okay?  I was gonna call Rico over but he's a no go, so Aaron is coming over and I'm just--girl, I'm gonna go for it because I'm so horny.  I mean it, girl.  You know me.  Please, just call me back.  If I just open the door in lingerie, would I look like a whore?  Yeah, you look like a whore.  Hey.	
AARON	Hey.	
KAREN	Come on in.	
AARON	Thank you.	
KAREN	You look nice.	
AARON	I feel a bit overdressed.	
KAREN	Oh, no.  I just wanted to be comfortable.	
AARON	Okay.	
KAREN	Take your jacket, please.	
AARON	Yeah, sure.	
KAREN	Okay.  Oh, you smell really good.	
AARON	(chuckles) Thank you.	
KAREN	No, thank you.	
AARON	For?	
KAREN	Just understanding.	
AARON	Yes.  Your guy was pretty upset today.	
KAREN	Well, if you noticed, I didn't go off.	
AARON	I did.	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.	
AARON	I was proud of you.	
KAREN	Thank you.	
AARON	Uh-hmm.	
KAREN	You know, some of my girls actually said the same things that you said about my mouth.	
AARON	Okay.  But to be clear, it is a pretty mouth.	
KAREN	(chuckles) Don't start.  Don't.	
AARON	No, it is.  I mean, what do you want me to say?	
KAREN	Well, thank you.  And thank you for not saying, "I told you so."	
AARON	Oh, not from me.	
KAREN	Thank you.  You know, I feel like I'm just speaking the truth but I guess I got to do better.	
AARON	Well, there's nothing wrong in speaking the truth just so long as you don't speak it to tear somebody down.	
KAREN	You sound like a preacher though.  It's a bit much, just a little bit.  Yeah.	
AARON	I am.	
KAREN	(laughs) Get the… out of here.  What?	
AARON	I'm a preacher.	
KAREN	You are what?  You--a preacher?	
AARON	A preacher.	
KAREN	Of what?  Like a reverend?	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	(chuckles) Like in a pulpit?	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	You got a church?	
AARON	Well, I have a church home, it's not my church.  Yeah.	
KAREN	What, you being serious?	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	Oh, well, praise, Jesus.  Why didn't you tell me that?	
AARON	Well, why would I lead with that, right?  "Hey I'm Aaron, I'm a preacher."  It's a bit intense.	
KAREN	Wait.  But why are you here?	
AARON	What do you mean?	
KAREN	I mean, it seemed like you wanted to, you know.	
AARON	Like, have sex?	
KAREN	Yeah.  I mean, you said dinner, so just…	
AARON	I didn't want sex.  I wanted to get to know you.	
KAREN	But you kissed me.	
AARON	No sin in that.	
KAREN	Oh, okay.	
AARON	What?	
KAREN	What time is it?	
AARON	(clicks tongue) A little after 8:00.	
KAREN	Oh, ain't that about the time that Paul and Silas prayed?	
AARON	Actually, it was midnight but you know the word.	
KAREN	My grandma took me once or twice.	
AARON	(chuckles) See, I knew I was led to you.	
KAREN	Led?	
AARON	Yeah.  Yeah, you don't see?  This is God's work.  Yeah.	
KAREN	This is God's work?	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	(chuckles) Excuse me.	
AARON	Are you tired?	
KAREN	Yeah.	
AARON	Okay.	
KAREN	Yeah.  It was a long day.	
AARON	Well, do you wanna have a quick dinner then so that way you can get your rest?  I mean, I wouldn't wanna keep you up.	
KAREN	Oh, I mean, yeah, we could--we could do that.  Okay.  I'll get--let me get you some--something to drink, I'm gonna get you--no, you stay, I'll get you some wine, some water, some soda, ice…	
AARON	Iced tea is perfect. 	
KAREN	Iced tea.  Okay.	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	You take it with sugar?	
AARON	Just a little bit.  I like to keep it pure.	
KAREN	Like the Virgin Mary?	
AARON	Yes.  You understand me.	
KAREN	I do now.  I'm going to hell.  I'm going to hell.	
SABRINA	(laughs) Damn.  Are you okay?	
CALVIN	Oh, my ass.	
SABRINA	(laughs) I need a break.	
CALVIN	No.  No.  No.  Come on.	
SABRINA	What?	
CALVIN	No.	
SABRINA	Oh, no, no, no.	
CALVIN	No, no, no, no.	
SABRINA	I will never make fun of your underwear again.	
CALVIN	No.  No.  You were talking about my underwear, what else are you doing?  You were judging me, remember that?	
SABRINA	(laughs) Judging you.  I'm never gonna judge you again.	
CALVIN	Yeah.  You damn right you ain't gonna judge me.  Yeah.	
SABRINA	I just have questions.	
CALVIN	Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  No more questions until I (indistinct)	
SABRINA	You are a maniac.	
CALVIN	Yeah.  You do that to me.	
SABRINA	Are you sure?

AARON	Why are you acting so strange now that you know what I do for a living?	
KAREN	I'm not.	
AARON	Yeah, you are.  You're barely looking at me.	
KAREN	Am I?	
AARON	You got your shirt all tight around your neck.	
KAREN	Ain't that the way the sisters wear it at the church?

FATIMA	I can really lose my job but…	
KAREN	Is she--is she all right?	
FATIMA	No.  She was in the bathroom crying earlier and--please do not tell her I told you this.	
KAREN	I'm not gonna tell her nothing.	
FATIMA	And then she just ran out of here with her bags and keys.	
KAREN	Did she say what was going on?	
FATIMA	No.	
KAREN	Okay.  Look, I'm coming, okay?

CALVIN	What?	
DANNI	(heavy breathes) What?	
SABRINA	Girl, I am so sick of your attitude.	
DANNI	I don't wanna talk to you.  So…	
SABRINA	Then why did you pick up the phone?	
DANNI	You know, you're right.  I'm gonna hang up now.	
SABRINA	No, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  Have you heard from Andi?	
DANNI	No.	
SABRINA	We're going over to her house.  Something's wrong.	
DANNI	Don't try to get me over there so you all can make up.	
SABRINA	She left work crying.  I'm gonna go over to her house to check on her.  Are you coming?	
DANNI	No, this is some bullshit and I know it.	
SABRINA	Fine.  Bye.	
DANNI	Bye.	
KAREN	Andi?  Andi?  What's wrong?  What's going on?  Andi.  You're scaring me.  Tell me what's going on, please.	
SABRINA	Hey.	
KAREN	Hey.	
SABRINA	What's going on?	
KAREN	I don't know.  She won't say nothing.	
SABRINA	Hey, Andi, what's wrong, honey?	
KAREN	Can you just get us some water, please?	
SABRINA	What the hell is wrong with you?	
KAREN	Just go.  Hey, Andi.  Is this about Gary?  Did he do something?  Tell me, are you scared?  Please tell me.  What's going on?  Sabrina, water.	
DANNI	I know you… lying.  Andi, what's wrong with you?	
SABRINA	I don't know.  She's not saying anything.  Here, I got you some water.	
DANNI	What the hell is water supposed to do, Sabrina?  Move.  What's wrong with you?	
SABRINA	I don't…	
KAREN	We could do this without you.	
DANNI	Shut up.  I'm not talking to you.	
KAREN	You know… I'm really sick of you.  I'm really sick.	
DANNI	Then step to me.  Step to me.	
KAREN	And you said last time…	
SABRINA	Can you stop?  Stop, stop.	
KAREN	Because you know who the… it is.	
SABRINA	What are these?	
KAREN	What is this?	
DANNI	What the hell?	
SABRINA	What?	
ANDI	He played me.  (crying)	
SABRINA	What are these?	
ANDI	His wife hired a private detective and these are the photos of me and him.  And these are the photos of his other woman.	
DANNI	Wait, so you've been lying to us?	
SABRINA	Danni.	
ANDI	Yeah.  And his wife came to me because she wanted me to represent her and my boss demanded that I do it.  So now, I'm gonna get disbarred or fired when she sees these.	
SABRINA	What did your boss say…	
ANDI	They don't give a damn about me, Sabrina.  They just care about the money.	
DANNI	I don't know why you couldn't just tell us.	
SABRINA	Danni.	
DANNI	No.  This is the shit that I'm talking about.  Holding out on…	
ANDI	This is embarrassing, okay?  This shit is embarrassing.	
DANNI	Yeah.  You got that right.	
KAREN	This girl…	
DANNI	Bitch…	
SABRINA	Stop.	
KAREN	Look, look.  It ain't like we all don't have things we embarrassed about.	
DANNI	Why do you look at me when you say that?	
KAREN	Can this be about anyone else just for a minute, Danni?  Maybe?	
DANNI	Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I should just punch you in your face.	
KAREN	You know what?  I really wish you…	
ANDI	Stop it.	
KAREN	I wish you would.	
ANDI	Stop it.	
KAREN	I'm sorry.	
SABRINA	Listen to her.	
ANDI	I am sorry I lied, okay?  Okay?	
DANNI	That's better.	
ANDI	This bastard lied to me.  You know, men really ain't shit.  He played me.  And I think he played his wife into coming to see me.	
KAREN	This is… up.	
SABRINA	What are you gonna do, Andi?	
ANDI	I don't know.  I have a meeting with them in the morning.	
DANNI	I'm sorry, girl.  You don't even deserve this.  This is low down.	
KAREN	Did you talk to him?	
ANDI	I don't know what to say.	
KAREN	Girl, you got to confront him.	
ANDI	I am.	
DANNI	We all are.  Oh, I'm in this picture.  I look kind of cute.	
SABRINA	Shh.  Just stop.	
DANNI	Sorry, I'm just--girl, you should've let me confront him then, him and his ho'.	
ANDI	She's actually really nice.	
DANNI	Who?	
ANDI	His wife.	
DANNI	Which one is his wife? …	
ANDI	That's his wife.	
DANNI	Andi, that's not the same woman.	
ANDI	Danni, that's his wife.	
DANNI	Yeah, but that's not who I saw at the airport.	
ANDI	Motherfucker.	
NARRATOR	Next on Sistas…	
ANDI	I can't believe he would do this to me.	
DANNI	You can't believe the married men who cheat.	
KAREN	Maybe you should go…	
DANNI	I'm not going anywhere, Karen.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Danni, shh.	
ANDI	Well, you might as well leave if you're just gonna keep bickering at each other.	
GARY	Hi.	
MAURICE	So how was it?	
SABRINA	It's good.	
MAURICE	I know he just put it anywhere, don't he?	
SABRINA	That's something I would wear.	
MAURICE	Wait, what?	
KAREN	I'm sorry.	
DANNI	I'm sorry, too.	
SABRINA	Oh, you're so sweet.	
DANNI	Yeah.  But I […] Zac, so.	
KAREN	What did you say?
