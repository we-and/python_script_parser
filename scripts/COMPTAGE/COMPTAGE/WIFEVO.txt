??	What a great way  to start the day.    

??	As you tell me  every morning.    

??	You know, you should  really join me.    

??	And smell like chlorine  the rest of the day?    

??	Not to mention  what it would do to my hair.    

??	I give up.    

??	So, what's your day like?  Same ol', same ol'.    

??	Probably go out  with the team  for some drinks after work.    

??	Oh.    

??	Okay. That's-   

??	Why? Did-Did we have  something planned?    

??	No. No, we didn't.    

??	I was just thinking,  you know, been a long time...    

??	since we had a nice,  quiet dinner at home together.    

??	Well, I can get out of it  if you want me to.    

??	No, it's okay.    

??	Besides, I have a big day  at the office today anyway.    

??	Yeah, one of these days  I wanna make it down there.    

??	Why?  To see you  in your business suit.    

??	Bossing all  the people around.    

??	 [ Laughs ]  It's really not  that thrilling.    

??	I don't know.  It might be a turn-on.    

??	Really?    

??	I don't know.    

??	Well, I mean, I could  just wear my business suit  around for you...    

??	when you get home.    

??	I might just take you  up on that offer.    

??	Yeah?  Yeah.    

??	 It's all yours, Beth.  See you later.    

??	Hey, Frank.  What, babe?    

??	I, um-   

??	You know, I really  got to get going.    

??	Catch you later.  Okay.    

??	Good morning, Daphne.  Good morning, Deedee.    

??	So, how are things  looking today?    

??	My first client is late.  Typical.    

??	Ah, of course.  Well, is Kara here?    

??	Yeah. She's in the back  looking through  the appointment book.    

??	Great.    

??	I would love  a cup of coffee.    

??	Of course.  I'll go bring you one.  Thank you.    

??	There she is.  Hi.  Hello.    

??	How are you?    

??	Tell me what you think.    

??	Oh, my God!  It's incredible.  Thank you.    

??	Who's it from?  Mr. Speedo.    

??	Oh, the guy who pretends  to be an Olympic diver.    

??	Yeah, that's the one and only.    

??	So, what does this mean?  You're engaged?    

??	Oh, girl,  no, no, no, no, no.    

??	Uh, he was just showing me  his appreciation  for our time together.    

??	He calls me  his "little gold medal winner."    

??	That's adorable.  Right.    

??	Good for you.  Thanks.    

??	Oh. That reminds me.  Have you gotten any gifts  from  your----clients?    

??	Mine have been  really generous lately,    

??	but it's just  one of the perks  of the job really.    

??	Well, there's  been offers.    

??	Offers. Like what?    

??	Well, let's see.    

??	The French guy  wanted to buy me  an Aston Martin.    

??	Honey!    

??	And the New York broker,  a strand of pearls.  You know.    

??	I love pearls.    

??	So, where's the necklace?  Where's the car?    

??	Oh, I turned them down.    

??	No. Oh, sweetie,  don't you know?    

??	God, you're so new  to this business,    

??	but you're not supposed  to turn down a gift  from a client.    

??	Here you go.    

??	Thank you.  All right,  I got to get going.    

??	My : client is here.  Finally.    

??	Oh, good.  Good. Who is it?    

??	Um, the baseball player.    

??	Wait. The one  with the really big bat, right?    

??	That's the one.  Yeah, I can't keep him waiting.    

??	Mm-mmm.  No, you can't.    

??	Bye.    

??	Should we?    

??	Absolutely.    

??	Here we go.    

??	Why do you think  he always wears  his uniform?    

??	Mm, I don't know.    

??	Gives him a sense  of power or something?    

??	Who cares?  It turns me on.    

??	Girl, that giant bat  is a turn-on.    

??	Yes. It's hot. Whew.    

??	I wish I could just  take it home forever.  You know.    

??	Oh! Oh, God!    

??	Wow.    

??	She's good.  I'll give her that.    

??	  Yeah!    

??	Yeah!    

??	He's really  giving it to her.  Yeah.    

??	Wow.    

??	Oh, yeah.    

??	 Yeah. Yeah.    

??	Oh, yeah.    

??	Oh, yeah.    

??	Oh, yeah.    

??	Yeah.    

??	This never gets old.  Wow.    

??	I love it  when we take charge.    

??	I know, right?    

??	I mean, even when  we aren't in control,  we really are.    

??	You know what I mean?  Exactly.    

??	Well, better  get back to work.    

??	Good start.  Uh-huh.    

??	Oh, man.    

??	Look at you.  You look amazing.  Your body's great.    

??	I don't know about that.  Oh, come on.    

??	Let me guess.  You don't work out and  you can eat anything you want.    

??	Yeah, I wish.  That'd be nice.

??	 [ Beth ]  So, who's this new client?    

??	Oh, he, um-   

??	he's a recommendation from  one of my Wall Street guys  actually.    

??	He's a venture capitalist.  Hmm.    

??	He, you know,  has a lot of money,  throws it around.    

??	Gets a little  pushy sometimes.    

??	Oh. My favorite.

??	That reminds me.  I got to go check the messages.  All right.    

??	See you in a bit.    

??	Deedee, there you are.    

??	I've been looking  all over for you.    

??	So, I have a client  who has a special request.    

??	He actually requested  that you and I  are together in a session.    

??	You mean a threesome?    

??	Well, yes.  You did say that you indulged  back in college, right?    

??	Yeah. Just once.    

??	I was really drunk, but-   

??	You know, sweetie,  if you're uncomfortable,  I can always ask Daphne.    

??	But he was really  insistent on you,    

??	so I think it might mean  a really good tip for you.    

??	Oh, you know  I don't care  about the money.    

??	You're so strange.    

??	So, what do you think?    

??	You'll be gentle?    

??	Always.  Prove it.    

??	Let me do that.  All right.    

??	So, how exactly  does this go?    

??	Well, usually,  we let the client set the pace.    

??	And more often than not  in these situations,  they just like to watch.    

??	Oh. Hmm. Okay.    

??	How are you?  Are you okay?    

??	Well, yeah. I mean- Actually, truth be told,    

??	I've been waiting  for something like this  to happen since I started.    

??	I mean, just the thrill  of the unknown turns me on.    

??	Oh, sweetie, don't worry.    

??	I'll make sure  that you're comfortable  every step of the way.    

??	Thank you.

??	So, who is  this client anyway?    

??	I was actually just about  to introduce him.  Oh.    

??	Hi. You must be Paul.    

??	I'm Kara,  and this is Deedee.    

??	Deedee.  Really?    

??	Yeah.    

??	Okay. I'll play,    Deedee.    

??	Paul.    

??	So, um-   

??	So-   

??	You know,  the clock's ticking,  so how about we get comfortable?    

??	Go ahead, girls.  You can start.    

??	Okay.  No problem.    

??	I think I'll just  watch for now.    

??	Great.  See?    

??	Oh, my God.    

??	Mmm.    

??	God-   

??	Oh!    

??	Yeah!    

??	Oh, that feels good, baby.    

??	Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.    

??	Do it, baby.    

??	Mmm.    

??	Wow.    

??	Whew. That was  pretty amazing.    

??	Yeah, it was.

??	Best lunch hour ever.    

??	You know, Paul,    

??	um, thank you so much  for coming,    

??	and I just wanted  to let you know...    

??	since you were recommended  by one of our clients,  you're always welcome back.    

??	So we hope  to see you again soon.    

??	Most definitely.  Hope to see you again,  Kara, Deedee.    

??	Mmm. 

??	So... really cute guy...    

??	but kind of weird, right?    

??	Yeah. That's, uh,  because he knows me.    

??	What?    

??	He's one  of my husband's clients.    

??	Wait. You're married?  Since when?    

??	Yeah. It's like  six years now.    

??	Okay. But-   

??	And my name  is Bethany actually.    

??	All right.    

??	I'm a little confused.    

??	Do you mind  catching me up  a little bit?    

??	A long story  really short.    

??	Um, my marriage  was in a slump,    

??	and originally I thought  my husband was having  an affair.    

??	But then I realized  there was no way  that was happening.    

??	And so I started  to think that it was me,  you know,    

??	and sex had just  become routine for us.    

??	And sometimes we'd go weeks  without even having it.    

??	And I was okay with that.    

??	So then what happened?    

??	I just decided  to shake things up.    

??	I answered an ad  for some nude modeling,    

??	and I thought maybe  that would bring me  out of my shell a little bit.    

??	Oh. So that must be  how you met Pauly.    

??	Yeah, and he told me  about the mansion.    

??	He's a really great recruiter.    

??	Yeah, and now it's  all gone to shit.    

??	Because of that guy.  Paul, right?    

??	Yeah. I'm not ready  to tell my husband  what's going on.    

??	I mean, what now?    

??	I guess let's just hope  Paul can keep a secret.    

??	Bethany.    

??	Uh-I'm upstairs.  I'll be down in a second.    

??	I'm here, baby.    

??	What's that for?    

??	For you coming home to me.    

??	Whoa, babe.  We got to slow down.    

??	What?  We're having  company tonight.    

??	What? Who?    

??	Paul Pearson.    

??	Paul.    

??	You remember Paul,  right?    

??	We had dinner a couple  of weeks ago with him?  Yeah, I think so.    

??	Well, we were supposed  to go out with the team  for drinks,    

??	but he called last minute  and decided that we'd work here  one-on-one.    

??	Why here?  I don't know.  What does it matter?    

??	We'll just have  a couple of drinks.    

??	Well, I don't know.    

??	Um- What's the matter?    

??	Hmm, just not  feeling very well right now.    

??	I hope you're  not contagious.  No, I'm sure I'm fine.    

??	I probably  just need to rest.    

??	You can handle Paul,  right?  Sure.    

??	You go on, and I'll- I'll take care  of everything.    

??	Thank you.  Okay.  All right.  
   
??	Hey.  Yeah.    

??	You sure  you're okay?    

??	Yeah, I'm fine.  I just need to rest.    

??	You want me  to bring you anything?  No. I'm good.    

??	All right.    

??	Oh. I forgot to ask you  about the office.    

??	How's the office grind?    

??	It's grinding.    

??	But we can talk  about that later.    

??	Kara, it's me.  It's important.    

??	Please call me  as soon as you get this.    

??	So I said,  "Listen, Charlie.    

??	If you don't get  that car here in  minutes,  you should drive to Canada...    

??	because that's the only place  you'll get a job."

??	Hmm.    

??	It's a, um, shame  that Bethany couldn't  join us tonight.    

??	Yeah. I learned  a long time ago.    

??	When she says she's tired,  I let her lay down.    

??	Not gonna poke  that tiger.    

??	Women. Right?  Amen.    

??	Maybe she'll  feel better  in a little while.    

??	Sure.    

??	I remember  she was very charming.    

??	Yeah, she's a keeper.    

??	Another beer?    

??	Sure.    

??	I'll get the contracts, too,  so we can go over 'em.    

??	No rush.  I've got all night.    

??	All right.    

??	Hey.    

??	Hey.  There she is.    

??	Honey, you remember Paul.  Of course.    

??	It's nice to see you again.    

??	We, uh- We're just  talking about you.    

??	Really?    

??	Yes. Frank thinks  you're a keeper,  and I must agree.    

??	Well, I think  we're good for each other.    

??	Absolutely.    

??	I just see you two together  and see what a committed couple  you are.    

??	You're feeling better?  Oh, much. Thank you.    

??	So we're about to go  over the contracts here.    

??	Oh, great.  I'll just leave you to it.    

??	You guys  can do your thing.  [ Paul ] Stay.    

??	Have a drink with us.  We're in no rush,  are we, Frank?    

??	Absolutely not.    

??	Honey, you want me  to get you anything?    

??	You know, why don't  I make you gentlemen  some snacks.    

??	"Gentlemen." So formal.    

??	Aren't we beyond that by now?    

??	Something to eat  would be great.    

??	Okay,  I'll get it on then.  Excuse me.    

??	Wha- What are you doing?    

??	I thought  I'd lend a hand  with the snacks.    

??	I think  I can manage.    

??	Look, what do you  want from me?    

??	Isn't it obvious?    

??	No. Why don't you  enlighten me?    

??	I wanna see you again  at Rose's.  [ Sighs ]    

??	We really didn't get  to  know----each other,  if you know what I mean.    

??	Yeah, I do know  what you mean.    

??	And us meeting again at Rose's  is not going to happen.    

??	Really?    

??	I thought I paid  for a session.    

??	And I get what I want.    

??	I might not even  go back there.    

??	That's a shame.    

??	You have real...    

??	talent.    

??	Look, are you going  to tell Frank?    

??	And ruin  a perfect marriage?    

??	I wasn't  thinking of it.    

??	Paul was right.    

??	About what?    

??	About coming over here  and doing the contracts.    

??	I'm almost finished  with these.  Oh, that's great then.    

??	What do you say  when I close the deal,  we take a little vacation?    

??	Really?    

??	Yeah. Up to wine country...    

??	and get a room  at a bed-and-breakfast...    

??	and stay drunk in bed  for three days.    

??	I would love that.    

??	I love you.    

??	I love you.    

??	Oh, yeah.    

??	It feels good.    

??	Yes. Yes.    

??	Yes.    

??	What got into you?  Don't lose it.    

??	You look nice.    

??	You ready  for another day at the office?    

??	I'm not sure  I'm going to go back.    

??	Really?  What happened? Why?    

??	Uh, Frank

??	Don't answer that.    

??	Look, we need to talk.    

??	Let me see who it us,  and I'll get rid of him.    

??	Can you just  sit down and listen?  This is important.    

??	Okay.    

??	I'm all yours.    

??	It's about my job.    

??	Okay.    

??	It's not really  an office job.    

??	What is it?    

??	Well, it's an  exclusive club for men...    

??	where they can go  and meet women and-   

??	And what?    
 
??	Have sex.    

??	What, you're telling me you...    

??	work at a whorehouse?    

??	It's much  more complicated  than that.    

??	You work  at a whorehouse.    

??	Can you please  stop saying that?    

??	What the hell's  going on here, Bethany?    

??	I've been feeling  really frustrated.    

??	So you decided  to become one?    

??	I'm listening.    

??	I wasn't doing it  for the money.    

??	I just...    

??	wanted to feel  a little thrill,    

??	maybe some passion,  something exciting.    

??	I just-   

??	What, are you saying  it's my fault?  No.    

??	No. I just-   

??	You and I have just  become complacent.    

??	You know?  And I've tried  to talk to you about it,    

??	but you've just  shut down on me.  So it  is----my fault.    

??	This isn't  a blame game, Frank.    

??	I can't believe  what I'm hearing.    

??	Look, Paul came  to the mansion yesterday.    

??	Paul?    

??	Son of a bitch.    

??	Just slow down.  I'm gonna kill him.    

??	It wasn't planned.  It just happened.    

??	So you and him- No, no, no.    

??	He-He just watched me  and another girl  have sex really.    

??	I can't believe this.    

??	So no wonder  why he was so anxious  to see you last night.    

??	'Cause he already saw  all of you.    

??	Listen to me.    

??	He's nothing, okay?    

??	This whole thing  was just about me  going over the edge.    

??	And I don't want this  to ruin our marriage.    

??	I don't believe this.    

??	Please, can you  just try to understand  where I'm coming from?    

??	I understand.  I understand  I'm not good in bed.    

??	No. Look, this  is all on me.    

??	Right. I just stand around  while you go out  and have your fun?    

??	Like a dumb ass?    

??	Son of a bitch.    

??	That was amazing.    

??	Do me a favor?  Anything.    

??	Pack up your shit  and be out of this house  when I get home from work.    

??	But-   

??	Frank, I-   

??	Frank, please,  don't do this.    

??	You did it all.    

??	I'm sorry.    

??	You know something?    

??	I think you should go to work today.    

??	No. I'm done with that place.    

??	Nah, I don't think so.    

??	I wanna see you there and I wanna see  what you do there.    

??	No-They don't even know I'm married.    

??	Perfect.  You set it up then.    

??	I can't.    

??	Then I'll just get Paul  to take me over.    

??	Oh. No.    

??	Fine. I'll put  your name on the list.    

??	Frank,  you don't have to do this.    

??	I think I do.  Text me the address.    

??	Oh, my God.  I can't believe  he came here.    

??	Who?  My husband.    

??	I had to tell him  everything this morning,  and then he blew up at me.    

??	I've never seen him  so angry.    

??	Oh, my God. But, honey,  what is he doing here?    

??	I just think he's trying  to prove a point.    

??	This is going  to be awkward.    

??	Ladies, meet Frank.  He's a new client of ours.    

??	Hi, Frank.  This is Kara  and Deedee.    

??	Ladies.    

??	It's wonderful  to meet you.    

??	What will be  your pleasure  today, Frank?    

??	Do you mind Not at all.    

??	Sorry.    

??	Well, I think I should  get some, too, then.    

??	Okay.    

??	Sure.    

??	How can  I please you today?    

??	Nice attitude.  Mm, that's what  we're here for.    

??	Well, it's my first time.    

??	Don't worry.  I'll be nice.    

??	You are smokin' hot.    

??	Yeah, I get that  a lot actually.    

??	So, have you been  in this business a long time?    

??	You know what?  Why don't you  just do me a favor.    

??	Anything.    

??	Zip it.    

??	Yes. Yes.    

??	Ooh.    

??	Oh, my God.    

??	Yes. Yes.    

??	Yes. Yes. Yes.    

??	Mm-hmm.    

??	Yes. Yes.    

??	Yeah. Oh, yeah.    

??	I just don't think  I can apologize enough, Frank.    

??	I quit that place today,  and I have no intention  of going back.    

??	I wanted to get us back  to where we were  when we were first together...    

??	and we could barely keep  our hands off each other.    

??	We were so bold,  so adventurous.    

??	Do you remember  the night you proposed?    

??	After the opera?    

??	We stayed up  till the early morning...    

??	and then went  to that all-night diner.    

??	Do you remember  what you did to me  under the table?    

??	Look, Frank,  we're great together.    

??	And, yes, we hit  a rough patch,    

??	and I went  looking for answers...    

??	somewhere I probably  shouldn't have.    

??	But...    

??	if you can't forgive me,  I understand.    

??	I'll move out  in the morning.    

??	How was it?    

??	What?    

??	How was it  with the other guy?    

??	Please don't.    

??	I'll let you know  how it was with me.    

??	It was kind of dirty  and shameful...    

??	but pretty hot.    

??	Go on.    

??	And through it all, I-   

??	I wish you were there  to experience it with me.    

??	Oh, Frank.    

??	We did get off track,  didn't we?    

??	Yeah. But it happens.    

??	And clearly  you went a little crazy.    

??	Maybe just a little.    

??	But maybe  we needed that jolt.    

??	Yeah, I suppose.    

??	Now what?    

??	Now anything you want.    

??	Take off your clothes.    

??	All of it.    

??	Now touch yourself.    

??	Play with your nipples.    

??	Now put your hand  between your legs.    

??	We're gonna  be okay, Frank.    

??	Yeah, we're gonna be okay.    

??	Yeah, but no more  secrets, okay?    

??	No more secrets.    

??	You think that  all-night diner's  still open?
