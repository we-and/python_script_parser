HUNTER	You're fired.  Get out of my sight.  And get out of this house.

NARRATOR	Previously on The Oval.

VICTORIA	Tell him the truth.

GAYLE	He didn't do anything.

HUNTER	Why would you lie to us about something like that?

KYLE	What happened with her?

BOBBY	Nothing.

KYLE	You're telling me that you weren't there to have sex with her?

BOBBY	No.

RICHARD	Give me the gun.

BARRY	I'm not--dad.

DAPHANIE	Mom, they shot him.  Mom, they shot him.

DONALD	I'll have you reassigned when I get to work.

KYLE	Are you sure about that, sir?

DONALD	Yes.  You'd be better working with the new agency.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	You said the woman is with the (indistinct) Cult.

BARRY	Yes.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Is this her?

NANCY	What happened to her?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	That's what we're trying to find out, ma'am.

BARRY	Well, what about my daughter?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	I don't know.

BARRY	Was she with her?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Sir, I--I really don't…

NANCY	Okay.  Hold on.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	…have any more information just yet.

NANCY	So are you--are you saying that Ruth is dead?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Well, we're not sure.

NANCY	Well, why would you ask that then?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Because I need someone to identify the body first.

NANCY	I--I can't do that.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	All right.  Can you, sir?

BARRY	I just--I just--I just want my daughter.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	I understand that.  And helping me identify this Jane Doe might be a start of that.

BARRY	Where is she?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	She's in the morgue.

BARRY	Okay.  Take me there.

NANCY	Son, I'm--I'm gonna wait right here.

BARRY	All right, Mom.  I'll be right back.

NANCY	Okay.

RICHARD	(sighs)

SAM	Shouldn't you be upstairs?

RICHARD	I got fired.

SAM	What?

RICHARD	Yes.

SAM	Wait, wait, wait.  Let me--let me talk to…

RICHARD	No.  The President fired me.

SAM	Richard.

RICHARD	There's nobody to talk to.

SAM	Richard.

RICHARD	Yeah, I know.

SAM	Is this about your son?

RICHARD	This--this is about that girl.

SAM	That's what I mean.  She lied.

RICHARD	I know that, Sam.  Apparently, her parents believe her.

SAM	Wait.  You've been here longer than I have.  We need to talk to her.

RICHARD	Look, there is--there's nothing we can do.

SAM	This ain't right.

RICHARD	It's fine.  I mean, it happens.

SAM	Not like this, it don't.

RICHARD	(sighs) Look, Sam, just clear me out of here.

SAM	Just wait until the Chief of Staff comes in so we can talk to him.  He's on his way.

RICHARD	I am not begging these people for my job.  Look, I know what I do around here.

SAM	Just wait.  Just wait.  Please.

RICHARD	Sam, I am going home.

SAM	Have a seat please.

RICHARD	I'll stand.  Hey, Sam, can you turn that up?

DAPHANIE	My father was just sleeping in his bed.  We have to stop this violence.  I want whoever did this caught.

REPORTER LISA LOGAN	Of course you do.  Now, DC Police are looking into surveillance video from several neighborhood cameras.  Needless to say neighbors here are in an uproar.  Now, Mr. Fields was a pillar of this community and a deacon at the Hillside Church. The family is holding a vigil tonight for the murdered man, and police are expected to be in attendance.  Back to you, June.

SAM	You sure you don't wanna sit?

RICHARD	I'm standing right here.

SINGER	Feels like I'm running out of time.  You got to get yours, I got to mine.  Not really sure where we're headed to.  I just hope that you make it when I do.

SAM	People have lost their minds.

RICHARD	Sam.

SAM	Yeah?

RICHARD	I need your help.

SAM	What's going on?

RICHARD	It's Ruth.  She took Callie.

SAM	What?

RICHARD	Yeah.  Nancy and Barry are down there at the police station.  I don't--I don't know how much help they will e.

SAM	Yeah.  Let me make some phone calls and see what kind of favors I can pull.

RICHARD	Thank you.  That--that--that would mean the world to me.

SAM	Okay.  Sit tight.

RICHARD	Thanks.

MORGUE ATTENDANT	All yours.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Is that her?

BARRY	What happened to her face?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Mutilated.  Is that her?

BARRY	(clears throat) It looks like her.  It's--her tattoo matches and I recognize the scar.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  So is that a positive ID?

BARRY	Yes.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  We've got an ID.

BARRY	What happened to her?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	She was stabbed in the chest.

BARRY	Where was she found?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	On the side of the road.

BARRY	Where?

MORGUE ATTENDANT	(sighs) Benton Street under the bridge.

BARRY	Did she--did she have anything on her?

MORGUE ATTENDANT	Naked as a jaybird.

BARRY	How will I find my daughter?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Let's go.  We're into this.  Come on.

SAM	Morning, sir.

DONALD	Good morning.

SAM	Everything all right last night?

DONALD	Yes.  Did you get any information on him?

SAM	Yes, sir.  We have a file.  It's on your desk, sir.

DONALD	Okay.  Do you know how Kyle was assigned to me?

SAM	He requested it, sir.

DONALD	Change him out.

SAM	Did he do something wrong?

DONALD	No.  He's just not a good fit for my wife and I.

SAM	Yes, sir.  Sir.

DONALD	Yes?

SAM	May I speak freely?

DONALD	What is it, Sam?

SAM	Richard.

DONALD	The butler?

SAM	Yes.  He was fired.

DONALD	By who?

SAM	The President, sir.

DONALD	Well, there's nothing I could do about that.

SAM	Sir, listen, he's a good man and needed around here.

DONALD	Well, he should have thought about that before (indistinct)

SAM	Sir, you know his son did not do that.

DONALD	You know what?  I'll see what I can do.

SAM	I'll have him wait, sir.  He's willing to talk to you.

DONALD	No, no, no.  You won't, because it won't be today, I can assure you that.

SAM	Yes, sir.  His file is on your desk as well.

DONALD	Uh-hmm.

SAM	Get him out of here, okay?

DONALD	Yes, sir.

RICHARD	(scoffs) I told you.

SAM	He'll call you.

RICHARD	(sighs) Yeah.  Right.

SAM	He will.

RICHARD	Now I have to go home and explain this to Nancy.  (breathes heavily)

KYLE	Yeah?

SAM	(through phone) It's Sam.

KYLE	I just got home, man.  I need two hours of sleep.

SAM	Take the day.

KYLE	No.  What?  What?  No.  I'll be in.

SAM	Listen, he doesn't want you on his detail.

KYLE	What?

SAM	(through phone) No.

KYLE	He said that?

SAM	(through phone) Yes.  Yes, he did.

KYLE	(sighs) Okay.

SAM	(through phone) What did you do?

KYLE	Nothing.

SAM	It doesn't seem like--like nothing to me.

KYLE	Well, what did he say?

SAM	(through phone) He said he wanted someone else.

KYLE	Okay.  Fine.

SAM	Did you take care of our issue?

KYLE	Yeah.  It's done.

SAM	Gone?

KYLE	(through phone) Yes.

SAM	Did he talk?

KYLE	No.  No.  He sure didn't.

SAM	(through phone) Told you.  You wouldn't get anything out of him.

KYLE	(sniffs) Yeah.  I'll talk to you later, Sam.

SAM	All right.  Get some rest.

BOBBY	What's that about?

KYLE	Nothing.

BOBBY	Come on, man.  Don't leave me in the dark.

KYLE	Will you just hurry up and get better so you can get the hell out of here?

BOBBY	Just like that?

KYLE	The son of a bitch is replacing me.

BOBBY	I don't see why you just don't go after him.

KYLE	Shut up.

BOBBY	This is a lot of effort.

KYLE	I said shut up.

BOBBY	And it may not work.

KYLE	Yeah, well, it would have worked if you've done what the hell I told you.

BOBBY	Yeah.  Yeah.  (groans)

KYLE	Stop talking, all right?  You're getting blood on my sheets.

BOBBY	The hell with your sheets.  Asshole.

DONALD	Knock, knock.

HUNTER	There he is.

DONALD	How's your first day?

HUNTER	I don't know.  You tell me.  You ready to get started?

DONALD	Yes.  You've got a very busy schedule.  Do you mind?

HUNTER	Please.

DONALD	Okay.  So we've got a very busy schedule, but, first, I wanna start with the Paris accord.

HUNTER	If this desk could talk.

DONALD	Sir?

HUNTER	The night I had in here last night…

DONALD	You and the first lady, huh, sir?

HUNTER	Oh.  Bite your tongue.

DONALD	I should have known.  So the Paris accord is coming up, and…

HUNTER	She does this thing, she licks me everywhere.  And, I mean, everywhere.

DONALD	Hmm.

HUNTER	It's like--it's like she's really impressed I'm the President of the United States.

DONALD	Well, you are, sir.

HUNTER	Hmm.

DONALD	So the Senate majority leader wants to know…

HUNTER	I want her to come back tonight.  Can you make that happen?

DONALD	Well, sir, I can talk to Max and he can get her, huh?

HUNTER	You do that.  Give these to the Vice.  I wanna go golfing.

DONALD	Well, sir, you know, I don't think that would be such a good look on your first day, huh?

HUNTER	The hell with the look.

DONALD	You know what?  Why don't we schedule the meetings and then just publish a very busy agenda first, uh?

HUNTER	Right.  You do that, Donald.  You know, I'm surprised you're even here with that hot piece you call wife right now.

DONALD	Well, sir, she's out today.

HUNTER	Yeah?

DONALD	Uh-hmm.

HUNTER	New client?

DONALD	Actually, she's with your wife.

HUNTER	Why?

DONALD	They're shopping.

HUNTER	Hmm.  That's weird.  Victoria hates shopping.

DONALD	Yeah.  I think it's for a photo-op.  You know, make her look more relatable.

HUNTER	(laughs) Has she seen her threat assessment?

DONALD	No, sir, she has not.  

HUNTER	Yeah.  Why the hell not?  I've seen mine.

DONALD	Well, hers is a bit more sensitive.

HUNTER	Yeah?  How so?

DONALD	It's very racial.

HUNTER	Oh.  Do you have it?

DONALD	Yes, sir, I do.

HUNTER	Why don't you give it to me?

DONALD	Well…

HUNTER	No?  No?  Why don't you give it to me, Donald?  I'll show it to her.

DONALD	Yes, sir.  Yup.  But don't worry.  It's pretty extreme, but she's got an ample amount of Secret Service on her side.

HUNTER	Are you kidding?  If someone killed her, they'd be doing me a favor.

DONALD	(laughs) You're kidding, I know.

HUNTER	Do I look like I'm laughing?

DONALD	No, sir.

HUNTER	Hey, what--what would I have to do to pull back on her security detail?

DONALD	I'm gonna advise against that, sir.

HUNTER	Why?

DONALD	'Cause I don't think the public will look to kindly on the First Lady of the United States being assassinated, sir.

HUNTER	These feminist are always carrying on about equal rights.  Let's give them their first martyr.

DONALD	I am going to strongly recommend against that, sir.

HUNTER	You're no fun.

DONALD	Hmm.

HUNTER	You're never any fun, Donald.  Make me a drink.  Want one?

DONALD	No, sir.  No.  I don't usually drink before 10:00 AM.

HUNTER	I do.

DONALD	Yes, you do.

HUNTER	'Cause I am President of the United States.

DONALD	Yes, sir.
	
GAYLE	That's your cousin?  Damn.  What the hell?

PICKY	Yo?

GAYLE	(through phone) What the hell, P?

PICKY	What's up?

GAYLE	So Rachel's on your page?

PICKY	Are you crazy?

GAYLE	Okay.  Fine.  Then I'll come to you.

VICTORIA	There you are.

LILLY	Hi.

VICTORIA	Hi.  How are you?

LILLY	I am so sorry I couldn't make it to the inauguration.

VICTORIA	Oh, no.  It's fine.

LILLY	I really tried.

VICTORIA	Donald told me everything.

LILLY	You look lovely.

VICTORIA	Thank you.

LILLY	And the alterations, they we were just…

VICTORIA	Yes.  They--they were perfect.  Please.  I want you to choose some things for me that look great but are cheap.

LILLY	Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	I had a store in mind.

LILLY	Yes.  I looked it up.  Are you sure you wanna go there?

VICTORIA	Yes.

YUMA	If I may…

VICTORIA	Yes?

YUMA	This is highly unusual, The First Lady doing the shopping.

VICTORIA	I'm a highly unusual First Lady.

YUMA	Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	Shouldn't you be organizing the motorcade?

YUMA	It's ready, ma'am.

VICTORIA	Well, would you please leave us so that I may speak with my stylist?

YUMA	Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	These people know no boundaries.  They have to be taught.  So what did you think of the store?

LILLY	Well, it's a bit…

VICTORIA	Trashy?

LILLY	I wasn't gonna say that.

VICTORIA	No, just like to see.

LILLY	Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	I want to find a balance somewhere between Jackie-O and Michelle Obama.

LILLY	Well, I don't think that store has either of those.

VICTORIA	I still want to go.

LILLY	Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	I don't wanna look like the Vice President's wife.  She looks like she's going to war.

LILLY	Hmm.  Hello.

VICTORIA	Oh, don't mind her.  She's always got a bee in her bonnet.  Excuse me.  Where do you think you're going?  Excuse me.

VICTORIA	I asked you a question.

GAYLE	(sighs) Oh, my God.  Go to hell.

VICTORIA	I have been in hell since the day you were born.

GAYLE	Okay.  Then leave me alone.

VICTORIA	You are not leaving this house.

GAYLE	(chuckles) Yeah, I am.

VICTORIA	Where do you think you are, little girl?  This is the White House.  You can't just walk out of here.

GAYLE	Watch me.

VICTORIA	What'd I tell you?

GAYLE	(groans) Make them open this door or I will break that window.

VICTORIA	I asked you where you were going.

GAYLE	What did you say to him?

VICTORIA	To whom?

GAYLE	You know who the hell I'm talking about.

VICTORIA	That gutter trash?

GAYLE	I love him.

VICTORIA	Little girl, you have no idea what love is.

GAYLE	Oh, and you and dad do?

VICTORIA	Go upstairs.

GAYLE	No.  I'm not gonna be a prisoner in this house.

VICTORIA	I said go upstairs.

GAYLE	Did you not hear me?

VICTORIA	Yuma.

YUMA	Yes, ma'am.


VICTORIA	Tase her.

YUMA	Ma'am?

VICTORIA	You heard me.

YUMA	Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	I said tase her.

GAYLE	I wish you would.

VICTORIA	Go upstairs.

GAYLE	No.

VICTORIA	Yuma.

YUMA	Yes, ma'am?

YUMA	Ma'am.  Ma'am.

VICTORIA	Give it to me.  Give it to me.

PRISCILLA	What's that?

VICTORIA	Give it to me.  Give it to me.

GAYLE	You do it and I will tell the press court exactly what happened.

GAYLE	(grunts)

YUMA	Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Please.  Please.  Please stop.

PRISCILLA	(gasping)

GAYLE	(groans)

VICTORIA	This little bitch is so hardheaded.  Lilly.

LILLY	Ma'am?

VICTORIA	Let's go.

GAYLE	(groans)

LILLY	Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	She pissed herself.

GAYLE	(groans)


VICTORIA	You'll have to clean that up.

JEAN	Yes, ma'am.

GAYLE	(groans)

JEAN	You all right?

GAYLE	(coughs)

NANCY	Okay.  So was it her?

BARRY	Yes.  It was her.

NANCY	Okay.  What happened to her?


DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	She was stabbed to death, ma'am.  She had a seven-inch kitchen knife buried in her chest.

NANCY	Oh, Jesus.

BARRY	What?  Don't tell her that.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	I'm sorry.

BARRY	Look, I need to find my daughter.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	I understand that.  I have a question for you.  Where were you last night?

BARRY	What?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Where were you between the hours of 8:00 and 2:00 AM?

BARRY	I was home.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  Can anyone verify that?

BARRY	My mother and my father was there.  And so was my girlfriend.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  Is that right correct?

NANCY	I went to bed early, but I'm sure he was there.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	What kind of car do you drive?

BARRY	Hold on.  Am I a suspect?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	I need to clear anyone who had any kind of issue with her.

BARRY	I never had issues with that girl.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	You just told me that she took your daughter.

BARRY	Look, I need to find my daughter.  Are you gonna help me or not?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	I have a few more questions and then…

BARRY	You know what?  Come on, Mama.  We ain't got time for this.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  I highly recommend you talk to me right now.

BARRY	Let's go, Ma.  We don't have time for this.  Come on.  Yeah.  Okay.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	You really should talk to me.

BARRY	Come on, Ma.  Let's go.

NANCY	Okay.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Ma'am.

NANCY	I'm sorry.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	I will be in touch.

PRISCILLA	How is she?

DOCTOR POWELL	She's fine.

PRISCILLA	Okay.  Good.

DOCTOR POWELL	What happened?

PRISCILLA	She got shocked.

DOCTOR POWELL	From what?

GAYLE	My mother.

DOCTOR POWELL	What?

PRISCILLA	Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you so much for your time.

DOCTOR POWELL	Sure.

PRISCILLA	Yeah.  Okay.  In case you get cold.

GAYLE	Get out.

PRISCILLA	Yes, ma'am.

GAYLE	(sighs) I hate this place, and everybody in it.  (sighs)

JASON	Hey.

GAYLE	What the hell are you doing in my bathroom?

JASON	Chilling.

GAYLE	Get out.

JASON	Look, I wanna tell you something.

GAYLE	Goodbye, creep.

JASON	I know how you can get out of here.

GAYLE	How?

JASON	You don't wanna talk to me.

GAYLE	Okay.  You know what?  Can you just stop being a jerk and talk to me and tell me?

JASON	How much is it worth to you?

GAYLE	All right, Jason, get out of my room.

JASON	Okay.  Look.  So I've been reading about this place, all right?  And there are secret passages and exits.

GAYLE	Where?

JASON	I'm going to find them.

GAYLE	So you haven't.

JASON	No.  But…

GAYLE	You are so stupid.  We cannot get out of here.

JASON	Yes, we can.

GAYLE	No, we can't.  They are watching us 24/7.  You know what?  They're probably watching us right now.

JASON	Okay.  There aren't any cameras in the residence.

GAYLE	Yeah, well, in order to get out of here, you have to go through the main house.

JASON	Uh, maybe.

GAYLE	Get out.  Get out.

JASON	(softly) Fine.

GAYLE	Uh-uh.  No.  That way.  You know what?  Go get naked and prowl like you always do.

JASON	Okay.

GAYLE	(sighs)

NANCY	They think you did something to her.

BARRY	Yeah.  They always asking crazy questions.

NANCY	Well, why would they think that?

BARRY	I don't know, Ma.  They're the police.

NANCY	I don't like this.

BARRY	Ma.

NANCY	I don't.  (sighs) That poor girl.

BARRY	Ma, you are not helping the situation.

NANCY	I'm sorry.  That poor child.

BARRY	Ma.

NANCY	What?

BARRY	Are you talking about Ruth?

NANCY	She's been through so much.

BARRY	What about your granddaughter?  What is she going through right now?

NANCY	I'm worried about her too.  Just because I'm thinking about one don't mean I ain't thinking about the other.

BARRY	Yeah.  Okay.

NANCY	Don't you sit there and act like that girl's death didn't bother you.

BARRY	It didn't.

NANCY	But…

BARRY	I'm relieved.

NANCY	Don't you say that.

BARRY	Do you not see all the trouble that she's caused?

NANCY	Yeah, but she still don't deserve to die like a dog on a street.

BARRY	(scoffs)

NANCY	(sighs)

BARRY	Mom, I just wanna find Callie, okay?

NANCY	I know.  Lord, I do too.

AGENT	We need to clear out the store, ladies.

WOMAN	Wait.  What's going on?

SECRET SERVICE AGENT BILLINGS	Could you step this way please?

DENISE	Okay.  This looks official.  Must be Hunter.  Okay.  Oh, hi.

DENISE	Yes.  Of course.  First Lady.

VICTORIA	Yes.  The First Lady.

DENISE	What brings you to my store?

VICTORIA	Well, I--I've been told that I'm a bit flashy.  Isn't that right, Lilly?

LILLY	We'll, I don't believe that.

VICTORIA	(chuckles) Oh, thank you.  Can you help me, dear?

DENISE	Yes.

VICTORIA	Of course, you can.  I want to look like you.

DENISE	Oh.  Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	Lilly, would you please grab me a few things to try on please?

LILLY	Yes.

VICTORIA	I just love your taste.

LILLY	Gladly.  Thank you.

VICTORIA	So what would you have me wear?

DENISE	I mean, I'm--I'm just so humbled that you would come to my store.  I mean, my goodness.

VICTORIA	Yes.  And I'm humbled that you think that you can… my husband in the White House and I not know it.  Goodness.

DENIS	I don't…

VICTORIA	Oh, I hope your lips are better at blowing than they are at lying.  I really like this.  Where's your dressing room, dear?

DENISE	It's back there.

VICTORIA	Show me please.

DENISE	Right this way.  Okay.  I'll hang this for you.  Let's see.  I'll just let you get dressed.

VICTORIA	No, bitch.  (grunting)

LILLY	What?  Hey, is everything all right?

VICTORIA & DENISE	(grunting)

MAX	Ma'am.

VICTORIA	Get the hell out of here.  Get the hell out of…

VICTORIA & DENISE	(grunting)

DENISE	(grunts)

LILLY	What is going on in there?

MAX	Ma'am, please.

LILLY	That's … up.

DENISE	(screams) (grunts)

VICTORIA	(grunting) (heavily breathes) Tacky.

RICHARD	Sir.  Yo.

NANCY	Hey.

RICHARD	Hey.

NANCY	What are you doing here?

RICHARD	(groans) I just took the day off.

NANCY	What?

RICHARD	Yeah.

NANCY	You never do that.

RICHARD	I was a little worried about Callie.

NANCY	Oh, God.

RICHARD	What did the police say?

NANCY	It's bad.

RICHARD	What is it?

NANCY	(sighs)

BARRY	Ruth is dead.

NANCY	Hmm.

RICHARD	What?

BARRY	Yeah.  When we got there, they described her.  They asked me about the tattoo.

RICHARD	What?

BARRY	They had a Jane Doe.  It was her.

RICHARD	(sighs) So what--what happened to her?

BARRY	She was stabbed to death.

RICHARD	(sighs) Damn.

BARRY	Hey, did you talk to Sam yet?

RICHARD	(sighs) Yeah.  Yeah.  He says gonna try to help.

NANCY	Okay.

BARRY	Try to help?  Dad, this is my daughter we're talking about here.

RICHARD	And our grandbaby.  Look, he will help.

BARRY	Really, Dad?  'Cause it seems like nobody here cares about Callie except for me.

NANCY	Don't you do that, Barry.

RICHARD	Hey, that's not fair.

BARRY	Look, I got to go.

NANCY	Where you going?

BARRY	To try to look for my daughter.

RICHARD	I'll go with you.

BARRY	No.

RICHARD	Son.

BARRY	Dad, I am literally just gonna look for her.

RICHARD	Okay.

BARRY	All right.

NANCY	This--this is all my fault.

RICHARD	Come on, baby.  Don't--don't start that.

NANCY	It is.  All right.  You know, I won't start, but you apologize to me.

RICHARD	Apologize?

NANCY	For lying to me.

RICHARD	About what?

NANCY	Richard, why are you here?

RICHARD	(scoffs) Baby, look, I mean, I'll tell you about it later.

NANCY	(sighs) Richard.

RICHARD	Please.  Please.  Just let me think about it.

NANCY	Okay.

RICHARD	I promise I'll tell you.

NANCY	All right.  Well, while you're thinking about that, I hate to add this, the police were asking Barry a lot of questions.

RICHARD	What?

NANCY	Yeah.  About where he was last night.

RICHARD	Why?

NANCY	I think they think he might have something to do with it.

RICHARD	Oh, no, no.

NANCY	I don't know.  He's hiding something.

RICHARD	No.  All right.

NANCY	I mean, they--they asked him if he was here, and he--he was--he was gone.

RICHARD	I was with him, so I know he didn't do anything to hurt her.

NANCY	You were with him the whole time?

RICHARD	Yes.

NANCY	Richard.

RICHARD	Baby, can you please go make me some lunch?  I'm starving.

NANCY	Yes.  And then you tell me everything.

RICHARD	Okay.

VICTORIA	Do you know why I brought you here?

LILLY	To go shopping with you.

VICTORIA	No, dear.  I brought you here so that you would understand who I am.

LILLY	Yes.  Of course.

VICTORIA	I am a lady.

LILLY	Yes, ma'am, you are.

VICTORIA	And I have suffered and fought to no end to be in this position, and I will not let some two-bit whore ruin it.  That girl was seeing my husband.

LILLY	I'm sorry.

VICTORIA	And your husband is aware of that.

LILLY	Well, I don't think he…

VICTORIA	There's no need for you to say anything.  Your husband is the Chief of Staff, and I need an ally.  Can I count on you?

LILLY	Yes.  Of course.

VICTORIA	If you know of anything, will you tell me?

LILLY	Anything?

VICTORIA	If you know of my husband with any whores, will you tell me?

LILLY	Yes.  Of course.

VICTORIA	And I will do the same for you.

LILLY	Well, my husband is faithful.

VICTORIA	(scoffs) (chuckles)You're a riot.

LILLY	Am I missing something?

VICTORIA	Honey, no man is faithful.  They just haven't been caught.
LILLY	Well, I beg to differ.

VICTORIA	Hmm.  And she goes to bat for him.

LILLY	For him, I will.  He is a wonderful man.  One that I don't deserve.

VICTORIA	So you cheat?

LILLY	No.

VICTORIA	You're lying.

LILLY	I do not.

VICTORIA	Oh, darling.  If you're going to be in politics, you had better start lying better.

LILLY	I am not lying.

VICTORIA	And if you are going to convince your husband that you're not lying, then you had better work on holding a poker face or exercising your throat.

LILLY	Ma'am, I…

VICTORIA	No.  No.  I'm done talking to you.

CUSTOMER	Thank you.

SHARON	All right.  Have a good one.

KAREEM	And here you go.

SHARON	What's that?

KAREEM	Lunch.

SHARON	I'm good.  (chuckles)

KAREEM	Oh, Sharon.  Come on.  It's your favorite.  It's--it's from that vegan place, like 40 minutes away.  It was…

SHARON	Kareem.

KAREEM	I'm trying to make peace.

SHARON	Thank you.

KAREEM	And I'm sorry about earlier.  I shouldn't have gone into your business.

SHARON	Oh, I'm sorry too.

KAREEM	You sure you're okay?

SHARON	Yeah.  Just--there's just a lot going on right now, but I'm--I'm--I'm okay.

KAREEM	Okay.

SHARON	This is really sweet.  Thank you.  Hmm.

KAREEM	Yeah.  Hey.  You know, you can always talk to me if you ever need to get something off your chest.

SHARON	I appreciate that.

KAREEM	No.  I mean it.

SHARON	Okay.  Well, hmm, you might wanna mean it with her.

MICHELLE	Hey, baby.

KAREEM	Hey, babe.  Oh, thank you.

MICHELLE	I brought you lunch.

KAREEM	Thank you.  Thank you.  Sweetheart, thank you.  You shouldn't have.

MICHELLE	How are you?
KAREEM	I'm good.  Yeah.

MICHELLE	Good.

KAREEM	You see Sharon?

MICHELLE	Yeah.  I see her.  Hi, Sharon.

SHARON	Hey.

MICHELLE	I saw Barry the other day.  Are you two good?

SHARON	Yeah.  He's good.

MICHELLE	Baby, can we put these flyers up?

KAREEM	Huh?  Oh.

MICHELLE	We're having a vigil for the poor man that got shot in his house.

KAREEM	Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.

MICHELLE	Okay.  Thanks.


KAREEM	Of course.  Love you.

MICHELLE	Love you too.

SAM	Hey.

PRISCILLA	Hey.

SAM	Hey.

PRISCILLA	Have you heard?

SAM	Oh, about the tasing?

PRISCILLA	Yeah.

SAM	Yeah.

PRISCILLA	I feel bad for these kids.

SAM	Do you?

PRISCILLA	In a weird way, yeah.

SAM	Yeah.  Well, baby…

PRISCILLA	Okay.  Look, what are we going to do about Richard's job?

SAM	(sighs) Yeah.  I'm talking to the Chief of Staff.  Help him get his job back.

PRISCILLA	Okay.  I don't even know what to do about this.

SAM	Yeah.  I know.

PRISCILLA	But, babe, I saw the first daughter taking selfies.

SAM	What?

PRISCILLA	Naked ones.

SAM	What the hell?

PRISCILLA	She's out of control, Sam.

SAM	(sighs) Okay.  Okay.

PRISCILLA	And the son, I need you to watch him around Jean.

SAM	I didn't see any when I up.

PRISCILLA	I know you didn't see anything when you went up there, but I need you to watch him.

SAM	Yeah.  I don't like any of these people.

PRISCILLA	Ew.  All right.  Well, I'll see you at home.

SAM	Okay.

PRISCILLA	I'm gonna stop by and check on Richard and Nancy.

SAM	(clicks tongue) Oh, well, don't tell her.  I don't think she knows.

PRISCILLA	I won't.  I won't tell.

SAM	Okay.  I love you.

PRISCILLA	Okay.  Love you too.

SAM	All right.

PRISCILLA	Bye.

SAM	May I help you, sir?

JASON	Is this where all the staff comes in and out?

SAM	Yes.  Yeah.  Yes, it is.

PRISCILLA	If you like, we can arrange a tour.

JASON	No.  I--I prefer exploring on my own.

PRISCILLA	Yes, sir.

JASON	Oh, where do the fulltime maids live?

PRISCILLA	They live with the butlers.

JASON	Coed?

PRISCILLA	Yes.  They all live in the same dorm.

JASON	Oh, okay.  I see.

SAM	Is there anything you need, sir?

JASON	No.  Thanks.

SAM	You know he's gonna know you lied to him.

PRISCILLA	And I don't care.  You watch that sneaky little son of a bitch.

SAM	For sure.  I'll see you.

PRISCILLA	I'll see you later.  (smooches)

SAM	Love you.

PRISCILLA	Love you too.

NANCY	Okay.  Oh, yeah.  (indistinct) this.  Okay.  Ooh.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	She was stabbed to death.  She had seven-inch kitchen knife buried in her chest.

NANCY	Lord Jesus.  No.

NARRATOR	Next on The Oval.

NANCY	How far do you think you can go for that baby?

RICHARD	All the way.

VICTORIA	Don't you just love how they love each other, honey?

KYLE	I really do.


KAREEM	You're not happy with him.  What's he doing to make you like this?

SHARON	I don't even understand why we're having this exchange right now?

KAREEM	It's because I still love you, Sharon.

KYLE	I just wanna do my job.

DONALD	Okay.  Then do it with a Cabinet member.

KYLE	I want you.

JASON	What would you give me if I could get you out of here?

GAYLE	You can't.

JASON	I can.

HUNTER	America.  Yeah.  They hate you.  They think you're cold and snotty and a brat, but mostly just a straight-up bitch.
