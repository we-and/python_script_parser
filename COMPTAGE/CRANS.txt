PROFESSOR STERN	(SIGHS)Mm-hm

PROFESSOR JUAN	Mm... (MUNCHING)

PROFESSOR STERN	(CLEARS THROAT) Professor Juan. Professor Juan. Professor Juan!

PROFESSOR JUAN	Oh! Sorry, I couldn't hear you over my crunching, hehe.

PROFESSOR STERN	It's alright. I'm going to pick up some food, my treat. You want the same as last night?

PROFESSOR JUAN	No, I'm not that hungry...Just bring me some tacos, and two extra-large enchiladas and a chimichanga and a few tostadas.

PROFESSOR STERN	No problem. And keep an eye on the atomic particle reactor while I'm gone.

PROFESSOR JUAN	Everything is safe with me. Oh, oh, and...

PROFESSOR STERN	I know, I know. Don't forget the salsa.

PROFESSOR JUAN	(SIGHS) Oh! Oh! Ah!

MRS. DULLARD	Welcome to the Greenwood Public School Science Battle! Photosynthesis? Ugh! That's so boring! Next! Next! Next!

DANNY	(GRUNTS) Get back here! Otto! Sit! Stay! Stop!

JIMMY	Watch where you're going, Einstein.

DANNY	You know, calling someone Einstein is a compliment.

JIMMY	(GROWLS)

JONESY	Ha! Ha! Two for flinching!

DANNY	(GROANS)

JONESY	(BOTH LAUGH)

MRS. DULLARD	Up next is Danny Dawkins And...

DANNY	(CLEARS THROAT)

MRS. DULLARD	Where's your partner?

DANNY	No partner. I'm a solo operator.

JIMMY	That's 'cause he has no friends!

DANNY	They say the best inventions come from solving a problem, right?

MRS. DULLARD	(SLURPS) I suppose.

DANNY	Well, Otto has fleas, and he hates being shampooed. So I invented a Nano-Bot to go in and deal with them face to face. Have a look through the microscope, you can see my bot in action!

MRS. DULLARD	(GRUNTS)

DANNY	(CHUCKLES)

MRS. DULLARD	I don't see what the big deal is.

DANNY	That's because it's a small deal! It's a Nano-Bot! It uses liquid nitrogen to freeze the fleas...

MRS. DULLARD	Next time, try to make your project more visual.

JIMMY	Nice one, loser!

MRS. DULLARD	What do we have here? A volcano

JIMMY	Volcano!

MRS. DULLARD	Now that was entertaining! I think we have our Science Battle winner!

JIMMY	Volcano!

MRS DULLARD	Good work, sweetie.

JIMMY	Thanks, Mom!

DANNY	I thought this prize was for the best scientist, not the most obnoxious mamma's boy.

JIMMY	What did you say about my mom? Get him!

DANNY	(GASPS)

JONESY	Hiya!

DANNY	Shhh.

JONESY	Ha! Come on, Danny! You can't hide from us. You know the rules If you run away, it only makes it worse!

DANNY	(WHIMPERS) Shhh. Don't! (GRUNTS) Huh?

JONESYS	(BOTH SCREAM)

MS. EVANS	They won't be bothering you anymore.

DANNY	Wow. That thing is incredible!

MS. EVANS	Of course it is. I invented it. My name is Ms. Evans. I'm the principal at Cranston Academy. A secret boarding school for geniuses. I have a private matter to discuss with you.

DANNY	It doesn't get more private than this.


MS. EVANS	We've been following your academic progress for years, and think that you would be...Better appreciated elsewhere.

DANNY	You think? Huh?

MS. EVANS	We'd like to offer you a full scholarship to Cranston.

DANNY	Whoa! 

MAN	Welcome to Cranston Academy!

DANNY	Oh! Ah!

STUDENT	At my old school, they said that learning wasn't rocket science. But at Cranston, it is!

MAN	Cranston will help you unlock your full potential. You can let your imagination run wild, with everything you need to succeed right at your fingertips

TEACHER	Come to Cranston, and you could be the next Edward Fizzerton!

EVERYONE	We want you to come to Cranston!

MS. EVANS	Under our guidance, I think you could do great things

DANNY	So I have to decide between staying at my current school where I'm majoring in 'trying not to get flushed down the toilet, or take a full scholarship to a place with the word 'genius' in its name?

MS. EVANS	I'll understand if you need some time to think it over.

DANNY	I'm in!

MS. EVANS	Good. We'll send a car.Don't forget to wash your hands.

DANNY'S MOM	Now when they say full scholarship, does that include this car service? Because it seems pretty fancy

DANNY	Mom, it's fine. It's taken care of.

DANNY'S DAD	Remember what we talked about. I don't want to get a call from this new school, telling us that you've reanimated all the dissected frogs or developed some sort of experimental chicken expanding ray...

DANNY	Yeah, I'm sorry about that, but the effect should be temporary.

DANNY'S MOM	Have fun at genius school sweetheart. Tell everyone you get your smarts from my side of the family!

DANNY'S DAD	(CHUCKLES)

PARENTS	Bye, Danny!

DANNY	(SIGHS)

ROBOT CHAUFFEUR	Estimated time to London, England is approximately one hour and three minutes.

DANNY	Huh? Oh! Ugh! The flying car is very impressive. These mints leave a lot to be desired. Ahhhhhhhhhh!

ROBOT CHAUFFEUR	Remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the vehicle has come to a complete stop.

DANNY	(SCREAMS)

MS. EVANS	Welcome to Cranston Academy! Park car seventeen.

DANNY	Wow

MS. EVANS	(GIGGLES)

DANNY	Wow. It's miserable out!

MS. EVANS	This is the nicest weather we've had in months. Welcome to England. Cranston is home to the top students from all over the world. You're part of an elite group, Danny.

DANNY	Wow! Look at this place.

MAN	Hey!

ULANOV	Whoa!

MS. EVANS	Watch where you're hovering, Mister Ulanov! Sorry Ms. Evans!

DANNY	(GASPS) An atomic particle reactor? No Way! Ow!

MS. EVANS	The atomic particle reactor is off limits. It was damaged a long time ago.

TAMMY 	Ms. Evans? Can you please sign my permission form to keep my experiment going?
MS. EVANS	I think you're making great progress, Tammy, even though cloning isn't officially part of the curriculum.

TAMMY	Ooh! You hear that Tammy2? You're getting a sister! Awesome!

MS. EVANS	She loves cloning. Our 3D bio-printer has been going non-stop. Oh, which reminds me, I need to order more flesh cartridges.

DANNY	Ewww.

MS. EVANS	Oh, you're going to love your teacher, Professor Stern. He's a wonderful educator. And don't let his name fool you, I think you'll find he's quite fun.

ROBOT IQ	scan correct.

PROFESSOR STERN	Hm! Principal Evans.

MS. EVANS	Professor Stern, class, I'd like to introduce you to Danny Dawkins, the first recipient of the new Cranston academic scholarship.

PROFESSOR STERN	Ah, yes, the new scholarship program. Pluck a child out of the academic gutter and drop him into the best school on the planet.

MS. EVANS	Danny, why don't you tell the class about your science fair project? Mm-hm?

DANNY	I built a Nano-Bot to freeze the fleas off my dog. But that's just the beginning, there is a lot of other applications for this tech.

BOYS	(YAWN)

MS. EVANS	Good luck, Danny!PROFESSOR STERN I'll take that.

PROFESSOR STERN	(LAUGHS)

DANNY	(GASPS) My Nano-Bot!

PROFESSOR STERN	Let's get one thing straight, son. Cranston Academy is a school for geniuses.

DANNY	But I'm a genius too!

PROFESSOR STERN	Please. Your very presence in this room is lowering the average IQ by at least ten points. And that includes the pet hamster.

DANNY	Ms. Evans said she was really impressed by my science fair project.

PROFESSOR STERN	Please! Cranston students aren't even allowed to enter science fairs. This scholarship is our principal's short-sighted idea to bring in some fresh blood. But you'll fail soon enough, and we'll go back to being the great school we've always been. Now take a seat. Now, class...

LIZ	Don't listen to Stern. He's just jealous. My name's Liz.

DANNY	Nice to meet someone normal. You're a normal, right?

LIZ	Ahhh...I read about your bot design online.  It's brilliant. Your engineering skills would really come in handy on the major class project. Want to work with me on it?

DANNY	Thanks for the offer, but I'm a solo operator.

PROFESSOR STERN	Scholarship boy! Stop talking!

DANNY	(SCREAMS)

LIZ	Ah! 

DANNY	Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

LIZ	Thanks a lot, genius! That took me two bloody weeks to build and it's due in an hour!

PROFESSOR STERN	(LAUGHS)

DANNY	NO! Uh... No.

RUPERT	Oh! That's a shame Thanks! 

DANNY	Ahhhh!

LIZ	Can I help you?

DANNY	You're in my room.

LIZ	Actually, you're in my room.

DANNY	Huh? We're...

BOTH	Roommates?

DANNY	Are you kidding me? No way. This is so unfair!

LIZ	You think I want this? Do I look like I need some unhygienic, never showers, can't clean up after himself, roommate?

DANNY	Hey! I shower. Occasionally!

LIZ	(SIGHS) There has got to be a rational explanation behind this. Yes. Someone's trying to ruin my life! Ahhh..Ahhhh!!!

DANNY	We'll just go to Ms. Evans and tell her you need a new room.

LIZ	First, you're the one who needs a new room. Second, she's not going to do anything. I'm the only student without a roommate.

DANNY	In that case...

LIZ	What is that?

DANNY	A holo-wall. Just a little something I invented. It lets me know if anyone wanders onto my side of the room to steal my ideas.

LIZ	Why would I want to do that?

DANNY	I don't know, maybe because my last lab partner published a scientific paper I wrote under his name and got a RND job a Global-Tech.

LIZ	Ouch. 

DANNY	Yeah. Let's just say, I don't work with partners anymore.

LIZ	Uh...What is that?

DANNY	You don't know who Edward Fizzerton is? I can't believe they let you go here! He's only the guy who created the fusion reactor, photographed the inside of a black hole, and just announced the discovery of a new particle called the Fizz-Boson! If you couldn't tell, he's my personal hero.

LIZ	He's my dad.

DANNY	Whoa, wait. You're Liz Fizzerton? Wow. It's a lot to live up to.

LIZ	I'm not living in a shadow if that's what you're thinking. It's just a coincidence I'm taking all the same courses he did.

DANNY	What's he like? Is he like always doing cool things? Like just being cool or whatever?

LIZ	No. He's my dad. By definition, that means he's uncool.

DANNY	Are you gonna tell him about me?

LIZ	Definitely not. Good night, Danny.

DANNY	Well, how do you know, I'm not quite ready for bed yet, and the light switch is on my side of the room, so...Huh? Huh?

LIZ	Good night, Danny. Huh? (GASPS) Uh...Thank you for fixing it.

DANNY	I had to do something. I just couldn't sleep.

LIZ	Was it nerves?

DANNY	No, it was snores.

LIZ	(GASPS)

DANNY	You snore so loud! It's like a chainsaw.

PROFESSOR STERN	I'm so sorry to hear that.

DANNY	I know it's like...

PROFESSOR STERN	I mean, I'm sorry to hear that Liz is stuck with you as a roommate. And Liz, don't be ashamed, I snore too, due to my elongated uvula.

EVERYONE	(LAUGHING)

LIZ	I don't snore!

PROFESSOR STERN	Pop quiz! You have three minutes to solve this equation. I'm sure you all did the required reading.

LIZ	Pfft!

PROFESSOR STERN	That's time. I thought you didn't do the reading. How did you come up with this formula?

DANNY	I reverse engineered it.

PROFESSOR STERN	Hmph. Hm. Let's run this through the computer marking system.

DANNY	99! Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes!

TAMMY	3 Oh, that's the lowest mark in the class. 3 At Cranston, 99% is a fail.

DANNY	Thanks, Tammy2.

TAMMY	3 I'm Tammy3.

PROFESSOR STERN	You'll need to do better than that. If your major project isn't spectacular, you're gone.

DANNY	(BREATHES DEEPLY)

LIZ	Working on your major project?

DANNY	Trying to. I need to come up with something big.

LIZ	How about some sort of machine to recycle all those bad ideas?

DANNY	Very funny.

LIZ	Well, I'm going to bed, so you'll have to close the bad idea factory until tomorrow.

DANNY	(MOCKING) Ahhh...

LIZ	(LIZ SNORES)

DANNY	Ha! Oh! Shhh! Ahh! Ahh! Ah! New plan. Fix the atomic particle reactor, discover a new particle, name it after myself, and prove to everyone that I'm a genius and I deserve to be here. Simple. Well, Rome wasn't built in a day. April 8th. Inventor's journal. The atomic particle reactor is in worse shape than I thought. I'm going to need high voltage batteries, an insane amount of copper wire...And an even more insane amount of chocolate.

LIZ	(GASPS) Mmm...

DANNY	Oh!

LIZ 	So this is where you've been going every night.

DANNY	What are you doing here?

LIZ	Some nights I can't sleep. Every time I've woken up in the past two weeks, you've been gone. So this time I followed you. 

DANNY	Nice detective work.

LIZ	You know this atomic particle reactor is off limits, right? You're going to be in so much trouble.

DANNY	If I don't do something amazing, I'm not going to last at Cranston. So I'm fixing this thing.

LIZ	Professor Stern has been trying to fix this thing for years.

DANNY	He'll be even more impressed with me! I built a new IC circuit and rewired a high powered microwave generator into the control panel.

LIZ	Oh...

DANNY	Now stand back, I'm going to fire it up.

LIZ	Don't fire anything up until I'm back in the dorm.

DANNY	Don't be such a baby. Nobody ever made history sitting around doing nothing.

LIZ	(LAUGHS)

DANNY	Huh? Huh?

LIZ	Well, that was monumental.

DANNY	I don't get it.

LIZ	(SIGHS)

DANNY	Your electromagnetic polarity is reversed, dummy.

PROFESSOR STERN	(HUMS)

DANNY	So far so good.

BOTH	(GASPS)

DANNY	That's a bit alarming. Oh! Ha, ha, ha!

LIZ	Um...Danny? What are you doing?

DANNY	Checking it out.

LIZ	Wait. If you get into trouble in there, I can pull you out.

DANNY	You're such a worrier. Oh!

LIZ	What's going on in there?

DANN	 It's fine! Stop pulling the cord! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Maybe it's time to go home. (GRUNTS) Ahh! Okay, it is definitely time to go home! (SCREAMS)

LIZ	What happened? You're supposed to be tied to this cord! (SCREAMS)

MOTHMAN	(GRUNTS) (LAUGHS)

LIZ	We've got to turn it off. Come on! Come on! Why won't it shut down? (GRUNTS)

DANNY	One problem solved. Now let's get that monster.

LIZ	Uh...Huh?

BOTH	(SCREAMS)

MOTHMAN	(LAUGHS) Yes! Ha, ha, ha! This is what I needed! Yes, sí, sí. Come with me. Ven aquí.

DANNY	It doesn't look dangerous.

LIZ	Are you serious?

DANNY	For a monster, I mean. Maybe we should try to talk to it.

LIZ	Be my guest. I'll be right behind you. Very far behind you.

MOTHMAN	Ooh! So bright! So beautiful! It's like you speak directly to my heart. The whisper from an ancient love fills me with passion.

DANNY	Uh, hello?

MOTHMAN	Like the warm glow from the sun, starts a party in my eyes. Ay, ay, ay! Sorry, mi amor, it's not you, it's me. (CLEARS THROAT) Hello there!

DANNY	(SCREAMS)

MOTHMAN	Hello, chiquitita! Ay, ay, ay! Please, no! Don't take me back. Don't take me back to the scary place!

DANNY	We just want to talk with you.

MOTHMAN	Who are you?

DANNY	I am...Liz, no, I'm Danny. That's Liz.

LIZ	Hi.

DANNY	Who are you?

MOTHMAN	Daniel, Elizabeth, mucho gusto. I guess you can call me Mothman. I used to be something else but now I'm a monstruo.

BOTH	(WHIMPER)

DANNY	Where did you come from?

LIZ	Why are you here?

DANNY	What's this glowing slime? What is a 'monstraw'?

MOTHMAN	Not monstraw. Monstruo. Say it with me.

DANNY	What kind of alien language is that?

LIZ	You serious, Danny? It's not alien, it's Spanish. Wait a minute, that makes even less sense. Why does the moth creature speak Spanish?

MOTHMAN	I will answer all your questions, amigos. But first I need something to eat.

DANNY	What do moths eat? Oh, I know! Liz has a bunch of really tacky sweaters.

LIZ	My sweaters are off limits. Do not eat it them.

MOTHMAN	Sweaters sound good but I'm absolutely craving for some tacos.

LIZ	I know just the place.

MOTHMAN	Oh! I thought I lost you. You will be my baby forever. It looks okay.

WAITER	Welcome to El Tacos.	 May I take your order?

MOTHMAN	Oh, sí, yes, good evening. I would like an order of tacos al pastor, please, with todo. Two quesadillas with cheese, and one gringa. Por favor.

WAITER	We only have what's on the menu, sir.

MOTHMAN	Oh, mi Dios, qué horror. ¿Y eso? Mexican sushi? This will make my ancestors cry, even those in the moth side of the family.

DANNY	Uh, we'll just go take a seat.

MOTHMAN	You call this Mexican? This is an insult!

DANNY	Keep your voice down! If anyone sees you here, they're going to call the cops!

MOTHMAN	Oh, because I'm Mexican?

DANNY	No, because you're a four armed moth creature

MOTHMAN	from another dimension! Ah, I see, I see.

LIZ	Okay, we got you some food, now it's time to answer some questions.

DANNY	You better start from the beginning. Assume we know nothing. Especially her.

LIZ	Huh?

MOTHMAN	You know, I wasn't always like this. I was an engineer at Cranston Academy. One night, during a terrible rainstorm...lightning stroke. And I got sucked into the scary place.

DANNY	So that happened when a super high-voltage surge went through the atomic particle reactor? you got sucked into is...The fourth dimension!

MOTHMAN	(SCREAMS)

LIZ	What are you talking about? The fourth dimension is time. Everybody knows that. Yes, everybody knows that.

DANNY	Fine. I think that place you got stuck into is the fifth dimension!

MOTHMAN	Ahhhh! What...is this place? I never thought I would make it out alive. And believe it or not, I was quite handsome before I was a monster. But in the fifth dimension I was attacked by a giant moth. No! What is this? ¿Qué está pasando? It hurts. ¡Ayuda! Huh? Ay, ay, ay. I spent the last 20 years searching for that moth. I wanted my revenge! You talking to me? We meet again, my darling, as I knew we would. I can still feel your photons caressing my skin. Come here. (KISS) It must be terrible to have me...

DANNY	What is he doing?

MOTHMAN	and then to lose me like this.

DANNY	This is the most amazing scientific discovery

MOTHMAN	in the last hundred years.

DANNY	I'm definitely getting a good mark in science class!

LIZ	We have to share this with the world!

MOTHMAN	Easy for you to say, chica. You don't have moth wings growing out of your back.

DANNY	We've all got stuff we wish we could change about ourselves. Like Liz, and her snoring.

LIZ	Danny, I swear I'm going to strangle you in your sleep.

MOTHMAN	(GRUNTS)

DANNY	What's wrong?

LIZ	Are you okay?

MOTHMAN	Oh, I'm sorry, chamacos. Ever since I became a monster, I've had horrible headaches. The only thing that gives me relief is this. My dear salsita. Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce? Ha! My own recipe. And the one good thing to come from the fifth dimension. As I scavenged for food, I discovered the hottest peppers I've ever eaten. They are truly not of this Earth.

DANNY	And you made them into hot sauce?

MOTHMAN	Naturally. I am Mexican.

DANNY	Can I try some?

MOTHMAN	Mm. Be cautious, my pale friend. It is hotter than the fiery depths of hell.

DANNY	I can handle it. I love spicy food.

MOTHMAN	Hm. We'll see.

DANNY	(CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me for a moment.

MOTHMAN	Mm-hm. Good luck.

DANNY	(SCREAMS)

MOTHMAN	(GIGGLES)

DANNY	Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! (SPITS AND COUGHS)

MOTHMAN	So, how was it?

DANNY	Eh... I've had hotter.

MOTHMAN	Oh!

LIZ	What are you doing? We have class.


DANNY	Who cares about Stern's stupid class? We've got to go back to the portal!

LIZ	Students at Cranston don't just skip class. If you're not there, they'll send out a search party. We need to play it cool and act like nothing's wrong. We'll go back to the portal as soon as we can get away.

DANNY	Alright. Fine.

MOTHMAN	(LAUGHS) Mothman, you hang out here.

DANNY	Make yourself at home.

MOTHMAN	Oh! Clean sheets!

LIZ	What's the chance that he's regularly laundering that underwear in the fifth dimension?

DANNY	Actually, Mothman, do you mind sleeping under the bed?

MOTHMAN	(SNORES)

DANNY	Keep it low key in case somebody comes in. I'm going to have to burn those sheets.

MOTHMAN	Finally!

LIZ	Mm? Ah! I knew it! Do not eat my sweaters!

MOTHMAN	(GIGGLES)

PROFESSOR STERN	Your major project makes up 80 percent of your final grade. In many cases, it will be what defines your time here at Cranston. Who will be the first to share their proposal? Why not Mr. Dawkins, our 'give a kid a chance' student.

DANNY	(COUGHS) For my major project, I'm working with Liz, and we're going to demonstrate proof of a parallel fifth dimension. Uh, we're not sure how it got here. I think it's kind of like what happens in a black hole where space time gets bent on itself, or maybe like a wormhole or something...

EVERYONE	(LAUGHING)

PROFESSOR STERN	This is a science class, not science fiction. Elizabeth, I would advise you not to shackle yourself to someone who's going to drag you down. You've got a lot to live up to. Now, does anyone have a real proposal?


MARIO	I'm working on developing a wrist-mounted cold fusion machine!

MOTHMAN	Ooh! Taquitos ricos.

DANNY	Uh...Pst! Liz!

LIZ	Ow! Um...What are we going to do?

DANNY	At least he's not kissing light bulbs.

LIZ	Danny!

DANNY	Uh, Professor Stern? I need to use the bathroom.

PROFESSOR STERN	Stop interrupting!

DANNY	It's an emergency! I ate some bad Mexican last night. It really didn't agree with me.  I'll probably be gone for a while.

LIZ	I also have to use the bathroom...Bad enchiladas.

DANNY	What are you doing? We told you to stay in the room!

MOTHMAN	Ha, ha! Oh, my kids! I found a taco truck down the road that had some real Mexican food. Ooh! I was so excited that I had to come find you!

DANNY	Okay...Wow. (MUNCHING) That's really good. Liz, you gotta try this.

LIZ	Hmpf. Do you know how much trouble we'd be in if someone sees you walking around out here?

MOTHMAN	Because I'm Mexican?

LIZ	No! For the last time, because you're a four armed--

MOTHMAN	Oh, of course. Because I'm a four armed monster. Sometimes I forget, but then there they are.


DANNY	Well, Mr. You-have-to-do-better than-this already hates me, and now he hates you for working with me, so we might as well cut class and check out the portal.
LIZ	Uh...

DANNY	Be a pal and grab the door, would you? 

MOTHMAN	(GASPS) Oh. Ay ay ay.

DANNY	That's not good.

LIZ	You know that feeling you have when things are about to get really bad?

DANNY	I never get that feeling.

LIZ	Now quit being a negative Nellie. I'd rather be a negative Nellie than a dead Nellie!

MOTHMAN	Uh, who is this Nellie? Uh... Oh...

LIZ	The portal is back. Whatever monster came out of there is running wild on school property.

DANNY	You always assume the worst—

STUDENT	(DISTANT SCREAMING)

DANNY	In fairness, that student could be screaming about anything. Homework, acne,

LIZ	(SCOFFS)

DANNY	final exams--

STUDENT	(SCREAMING RESUMES)

DANNY	In this case, you were right to assume the worst. New plan get the monster back in the portal and convince that kid he's crazy. (PANTS) Oh man, it totally wiped itself off on that kid!

RUPERT	(GROANS)

LIZ	Come on.

RUPERT	(WHIMPERING)

DANNY	(IN GHOSTLY VOICE) You didn't see nothin'. Nothing.

MOTHMAN	You're loco. Loco. Loco, man.

RUPERT 	(WHIMPERING)

LIZ	(WHIMPERS)

MOTHMAN	(THUD)

DANNY	Shh. (SCREAMING)

MOTHMAN	Aaah!

LIZ	No!

DANNY	What are you doing?  He's a student!

MOTHMAN	A kid? I thought he was a monster. Kids over here are very ugly!

LIZ	Did you guys see that?

DANNY	It looks like it went right through the wall. Ladies first.

LIZ	Why me? You're the one who opened the portal.

DANNY	Technically, you fixed the last piece of the reactor,

LIZ	which makes you the one who opened the portal.

MOTHMAN	Mh-hm.

DANNY	So... after you.

LIZ	Hmpf. You suck. (WHIMPERING)

DANNY	Hello! Gooey pink monster?

MOTHMAN	His name is Manuel.

DANNY	That thing has a name?

MOTHMAN	Well, that is what I named him.

LIZ	Uh?

DANNY	Uh, guys...?

LIZ	Remember, it's probably more scared of us than we are of it. (WHIMPERING)

DANNY	I don't know, I'm pretty scared right now.

MOTHMAN	Quieto Manuel! (GROANS)

DANNY	That sounded expensive! Ooooh!

LIZ	This tastes even grosser than it looks. 

MOTHMAN	Danny! Use this!

DANNY	Suck on this, Manuel! Aaaah!

PROFESSOR STERN	Explain yourselves.

DANNY	I fixed the atomic particle reactor and messed with space-time.

PROFESSOR STERN	(LOW GROWL)

DANNY	I accidentally opened a portal to another dimension, and accidentally released a pink slime monster into our world. He totally destroyed the computer lab.

PROFESSOR STERN	Are you finished?

DANNY	Yes. No. Uh, the monster's name is Manuel. Now I'm finished.

PROFESSOR STERN	He's lying about the atomic particle reactor. I wasn't smart enough to fix it, which means you certainly aren't. If there's ever been a better case for expulsion, I can't remember it.

DANNY	Uh, wha...? Something horrible is going on and I have the feeling we're the only ones who can stop it.


PROFESSOR STERN	(SLIGHT CHUCKLE)

MS. EVANS	Get in the car.

LIZ	Go to the atomic particle reactor and see for yourself. There is a portal to another dimension!

DANNY	Please Ms. Evans, you have to believe us.

MS. EVANS	Life only gives you so many chances, Danny. The next time someone goes out on a limb for you, try not to throw it in their face.

DANNY	(GASPS)

MS. EVANS	(SCREAMS)

ROBOT CHAUFFEUR	Warning, warning!

MS. EVANS	(SCREAMS)

DANNY	Manuel, you idiot! You ate the principal!

LIZ	Ms. Evans!

DANNY	We've got to stop that thing! 

LIZ	Portal's getting bigger. It's doubled in size again! That means bigger monsters can come out...

DANNY	How much bigger can they get?

BOTH	(SCREAMING)

LIZ	I imagined something bigger.

DANNY	Awww.

LIZ	Yes, that's more like it.

DANNY	(GASPS)

MOTHMAN	Ha! Javier, you are bad eel!

EVERYONE	(SCREAMING)

DANNY	I really think you need meaner sounding names for these monsters that are trying to kill us.

LIZ	What happened to you? We were trying to convince the teachers that the fifth dimension was real. You were our proof! 

MOTHMAN	Oh, I'm sorry. You told me, hide from humans so, I hid from humans.

DANNY	There's no need to hide anymore. You'll fit right in. There are monsters everywhere.

GIRL STUDENT 1 	Okay...

GIRL STUDENT 2	Hm? (WHIMPERING)

STUDENT	(HUMMING)

IQ CAMERA IQ	scan, failed...Robot Sorry f...brrr a sorry...

LIZ	If my calculations are correct, If my calculations are correct, the portal will swallow everything in...Twenty-four hours?

MOTHMAN	(MOANS IN PAIN) Aaahh. Take them...to the brain.

DANNY	What are you doing? Let us go

LIZ	Mothman, stop!

DANNY	Mothman!

LIZ	Come on Mothman! What are you doing?

DANNY	Let go! Oh! I'm sorry about that.

LIZ	Danny, hit him with the ghost.

MOTHMAN	Take them to the brain... (GULPS) (BURPS) It's a little bit spicy.


DANNY	Stay back!

LIZ	Don't come any closer!

MOTHMAN	Eh, what's wrong?

DANNY	You grabbed us by our heads,  and said take them to the brain!
 
MOTHMAN	What? No!

LIZ	Danny dislocated your finger trying to get free!

MOTHMAN	I think I would remember  if you dislocated my f-- (SHRIEKS)

DANNY	For the record, I immediately apologized for that.

LIZ	Let me see that. Don't worry. this will only hurt...a lot

MOTHMAN	(LOUD SCREAMING) Thank you. Amigos, I have not been totally honest with you. My headaches, they are not normal headaches. Inside the headache, I hear voices that tell me what to do. The hot sauce is the only thing that clears my mind.

DANNY	You didn't think that would've been useful information to tell us before you tried to kill us?

MOTHMAN	This is why I'm telling you now.

DANNY	In case you try to kill us again?

MOTHMAN	Yes

DANNY	Very well. Proceed.

MOTHMAN	I didn't tell you, because it would make you think I was a monster.

DANNY	Yeah, you are a monster.

LIZ	But you're only a monster if you act like a monster. Now's your chance to prove who you really are.   Help us shut down that portal once and for all.
 
DANNY	What did you mean when you said,  take them to the big bad brain There's a guy in charge?

MOTHMAN	No, man. I mean an actual brain.

LIZ	No way.

MOTHMAN	The whole thing is powered by a giant, disembodied, pulsating brain. It's pretty asqueroso to be honest.


DANNY	Yeah, but it's our fault. We have to destroy it.

LIZ	If we want to kill this thing, we're gonna need supplies.


KID	Come on! Come on!  It's ringing! Hello? Miss Evans?

BRAIN	Mwar. Fick. Toosh. De. Belan.

KID	Wrong number They got Mr. Heath!

MR HEATH	(SCREAMING)


PROFESSOR STERN	Just because the portal was my experiment, doesn't make this my fault.

KID	Professor Stern, we need your aaaaagh!

PROFESSOR STERN	Ooooh. Darling. It's okay, Tesla. We'll go to a new school. Everything will be okay. (GASP) (STERN WHIMPERS)

TESLA	(SCREAMS)


LIZ	Take anything you might need in the fifth dimension.

DANNY	Flashlights!

LIZ	Safety goggles.

DANNY	Pillow?

LIZ	Magnifying glasses!

DANNY	Liquid nitrogen! Flare! Chocolate bars!

LIZ	Chocolate bars?

DANNY	There's always room for snacks. I don't want to eat whatever weird food they have in the fifth dimension. Right, Mothman?

MOTHMAN	(WHIMPERS)

DANNY	Mothman!

MOTHMAN	Good idea. The food there is scarier than the monsters. Hey! You think we have time to get churros?

LIZ	No time for churros. The tinfoil should stop those purple tentacles from making a connection with your brain.

DANNY	You sure about that?

LIZ	Of course not. But it can't hurt.

MOTHMAN	No bracelet for me. I'm a monster. I must warn you to prepare yourselves for a horrifying journey. You will see things in the fifth dimension that will make you wish you were never born.

DANNY	Mmm-mmm! Delicious

LIZ	Come on

MOTHMAN	My love, it's time for me to war and become a hero but we'll have dinner tomorrow.

KID	(Screaming)

LIZ	(Grunts)

DANNY	(Grunts) We need to get past those monsters and make it to the atomic particle reactor in one piece. Kari But there's too many of them!

LIZ	Guys, this school has been around for over 500 years. My grandfather studied here, my father too. It's our duty to protect it. If anyone's going to be able to stop these things, it's the smartest kids in the world. We need your help to blow some stuff up and cause a diversion.  Can you help us?
 
ALL	Yeah!

LIZ	Huh?

KARI	What's the PH?

KID	It's a 100% acid!  Neutralize it with a base, Yoo-hoo! Here doggie, doggie! I'll distract him! You guys meet me in the hall!

KARI	We need to go to the lab.

MOTHMAN	Ay, Ma-- Marta. Lupe! Hee hee, Nice to see you again! Easy, girls! Easy... Would you like to dance? (laughs) Come on, Marta!  Yes--! (Groans) Easy....(Screams) Easy....

DANNY	(screams) He won't be able to last for much longer.

LIZ	Where are you going?

DANNY 	Trust me I've done this before!

KID	Get ready, you guys! Run, run, ahhh!! (LAUGHING)

KARI	Lithium hydroxide coming up!

MOTHMAN	Stop it! No! Agh!

KID	Nice work.(CHUCKLES)

HAMSTER	(GRUNTS AND PANTS)

MOTHMAN	My money's on the hamster.

DANNY	Don't worry, he'll return to his normal size in a few minutes.

KID	02 We will take care of them.

DANNY	Come on, Mothman. Let's go

MOTHMAN	(GASPS) I can't...I can't go back.

LIZ	Yes, you can. Come on!

MOTHMAN	If you had seen what I have seen...


LIZ	Danny, we've got to do something quick.

DANNY	It's time to moth up. We're going in and you better be behind us

MOTHMAN	(WHISPERING) I'm sorry, Danny.

DANNY	He left us.

LIZ 	I know but we gotta move.

DANNY	Agh. Liz! Ah...

LIZ	Danny (SCREAMS)

DANNY	Hey. Give me back my chocolate.

LIZ	Danny...

MOTHMAN	Leave my friends alone!

LIZ	Mothman! You came back!

DANNY	What are you doing here?

MOTHMAN 	You are my new familia And nothing is more important than family.

LIZ	I guess he mothed up.

DANNY	You're darn right he did. Alright Mothman, it's a good thing you're here, Because we have no idea what we're doing Lead the way.

MOTHMAN	Of course my horse.

LIZ/DANNY/MOTHMAN	GASP

MOTHMAN	Shhh

LIZ	uh? Are you serious? Danny!

LIZ/DANNY/MOTHMAN  GASPING

LIZ	Hmm?

MOTHMAN 	Come on, we gotta keep moving. Um... Este....

DANNY	Ah, guys...

LIZ	(screams) Danny!

DANNY	Wow, they got everyone.

LIZ	Ms. Evans! She's okay!

DANNY	That's what I call a generous assessment of the situation.

LIZ	I meant she's not dead.

DANNY	I'm just saying you've got a low bar for okay.

MOTHMAN	The more brains it drains, the more powerful this place becomes. (GASPS) Gracias.

LIZ	It got Tammy! And Tammy2! And Tammy3!

DANNY	And I can only assume that's Tammy4. And Tammy5. And 6. And 7.

MOTHMAN	No! If you unplug her now, she will never wake up. We must stop it at the source.

LIZ	We have to save everyone before it's too late.

MOTHMAN	Stern? Amigo

DANNY	amigo?

MOTHMAN	We used to work together. He is my cuate. Did you bring the salsa? Stern! We are going to save you!

DANNY	No offense, but your cuate stinks

MOTHMAN	Shhh This way. (YAWNS) We camp here for the night.

LIZ	(YAWNS) Sounds good to me. I can't take another step.

MOTHMAN	Hmmm. (WHISTLES)

DANNY	Huh?

MOTHMAN	Cover yourself in the puss.

DANNY	Ew!

LIZ	What for?

MOTHMAN	When the night bugs come, they will eat the puss,and you will still have skin in the morning.

DANNY	I beg your pardon?

MOTHMAN	Night bugs. They feast on flesh.

DANNY	How are you okay with this?

LIZ	It's only logical. I hate bugs more than I hate puss.

MOTHMAN	You don't want no cucarachas up there, man.

DANNY	No thanks. I don't plan on sleeping.

MOTHMAN	(SNORING)

LIZ	(SNORING)

DANNY	Huh... Huh...Ow, ow! Huh... get off! Huh.. Huh...This place sucks!

MOTHMAN	to the brain

DANNY	Oh, Liz. Liz!

LIZ	Ow! Why would you wake me up when I'm covered in bugs?  I'm going to be traumatized for life!

DANNY	You'd rather be covered in bugs, and not know about it?

LIZ	Absolutely. Would you want to be awake during surgery?

DANNY	No...

LIZ	There you go.

DANNY	I didn't wake you up to argue about the merits of disassociation. Listen to Mothman, He doesn't sound good.



MOTHMAN 	Oh, great brain, I will do as you command.

LIZ	He's just dreaming.

MOTHMAN	Take them to the brain.

LIZ	Sounds like a nightmare.

MOTHMAN	So you may suck the brains of Liz and Danny.

DANNY	That's an oddly specific nightmare.

LIZ	Yeah. Let's wake him up.

MOTHMAN	Mwar. Fick. Toosh. De Belan.

LIZ	Danny, hit him with the ghost.

DANNY	(GRUNTS) Oh no

MOTHMAN	Mwar. Fick. Toosh. De Belan.

DANNY	It's empty!

MOTHMAN	Run! You have to get away from me!

LIZ	Mothman no, we're not going to leave you.

DANNY	We're not going anywhere. We're a team and we're sticking together.

MOTHMAN	Mwar. Fick. Toosh. De. Belan!

LIZ	Fight it, Mothman. You're only a monster if you let yourself be a monster!

MOTHMAN	I am not a monster...I am not a monster...

DANNY	That's it!

LIZ	Come on Mothman, you can do it!

MOTHMAN	(SCREAMS) I am not a monster!

LIZ	Mothman?

MOTHMAN	The voices. They stopped.

DANNY	(SCREAMS)

LIZ	(SCREAMS)

DANNY	Let him go, purple piece of--!

LIZ	Danny don't! You know what happens if you disconnect him.

DANNY	We can't just leave him here!

LIZ	There's only one way to free him now. We've got to the brain and shut it down.

DANNY	(GRUNTS) This whole thing is my fault. I opened the portal, I'm the reason there are brain tendrils attached to half the school...And now

MOTHMAN	's gone.

DANNY	Get out of here, Liz. Before my next stupid idea gets you killed.

LIZ	But we're a team

DANNY	I caused this problem and I'll fix it on my own. I don't need something to happen you too.  I'm a solo operator for a reason Stupid fifth dimension. Stupid vines. Stupid tinfoil bracelet. (SCREAMS)

LIZ	Danny! Let him go! (PANTS) Are you OK?

DANNY	Thank you.

LIZ	So, are we a team yet?

DANNY	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that stuff. I can't do this without you.

LIZ	Good, because I've been thinking. Mothman said the fifth dimension was a living organism and we're looking for a brain. What do these tendrils look like to you?

DANNY	Disgusting, veiny death hoses!

LIZ	Nerves. Like a nervous system that runs through the whole organism. The tendrils will lead us right to it. Like a map A disgusting, veiny, pulsating purple map.

DANNY	Honestly, I'd prefer a GPS.

LIZ	It's some kind of membrane.

DANNY	Insane in the membrane

LIZ	Don't start. We must be close. I bet the membrane is here to stop anything from getting near the brain.

DANNY	Stop this!

LIZ	You okay?


DANNY	I think so. I admit, that plan wasn't fully thought out.

LIZ	(GRUNTS)

DANNY	Unless you want to do some major exfoliating, you might want to stand back. (GRUNTS)

LIZ 	Good thinking!

DANNY	Hurry! This way.

LIZ	(LIZ GASPS) These tendrils look like they're all plugged into stuff. I don't think they're going to be a problem.

DANNY	Well, that makes it easy. (SCREAMS)

LIZ	(SCREAMS)

DANNY	(COUGHS) It's a brain storm.

LIZ	Really, Danny? Puns at a time like this?

DANNY	What would you call it?

LIZ	A fifth dimension meteorological anomaly.

DANNY	Oh yeah, because that really rolls off the tongue. Let's do this. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

LIZ	Uh, uh...! These are our friends. We can't hurt them. What are we going to do?

DANNY	We gotta split them up!

LIZ	Split them and tie them! Whoa! It's working! Yes! (SHRIEKING) (SCREAMS)

DANNY	Come on! Liz! Help me get the flashlight and the magnifying glass!

LIZ	I couldn't get the magnifying glass. Watch out!

DANNY	(SCREAMS)

LIZ	Danny!

DANNY	I'm okay but I still need that magnifying glass.

LIZ	(SHRIEKS)

DANNY	Throw it! (DANNY SCREAMS (PANTS)


LIZ	Danny, no!


DANNY	(GASPS)

LIZ	Let him go! Danny, no! (GASPS) (WHIMPERS)

BRAIN	(GROWLS)

LIZ	(SHATTERING) Danny, you're alive!

DANNY	(NERVOUS CHUCKLE) I knew it would work. Brain freeze.

LIZ	Hmmm...

DANNY	Oh, come on. That was good! What else are you gonna say when you're literally freezing a giant brain?!

LIZ	I'll allow it.

MOTHMAN	Aaaah. Stern? Stern! My friend! Stern, it's me, Juan!

PROFESSOR STERN	Oh my goodness. Juan?

MOTHMAN	Oh! You haven't changed a bit, chaparro!

DANNY	Run! Oooh!

LIZ	The portal. It's closing!

DANNY	It's losing power because the brain is dead!

LIZ	It's too far, we're never going to get out in time!

MS. EVANS	I-I'm on it! Initiate field trip pickup sequence!

DANNY	Field trip?

LIZ	Huh? Huh?

MS. EVANS	Go! Go! Go!

DANNY	Mothman! Quick! Stop! We've got to get Mothman!

MOTHMAN	Don't worry, Danny. I got a little thing I like to call disgusting moth wings! Adios, Manuel!

DANNY	Let's get out of here!

MOTHMAN	Francisca! Aaargh!


COMMENTATOR	Lucharán a una caída sin límte de tiempo, del lado técnico.. Mothman...

MOTHMAN	(SCREAMING)

LIZ	Where's Mothman? (GASPS)

DANNY	He didn't make it.


LIZ	(SOBS) He gave his life to save us.

MOTHMAN	I ain't giving my life for no one. I want to live!

DANNY	Mothman!

LIZ	Mothman!

MOTHMAN	I got four arms. Lots of room for hugs!

DANNY	So now what?

MOTHMAN	Eat a churro!

DANNY	Okay, but then what?

LIZ	Danny serves a lifetime of detentions...But we probably win the Nobel prize for physics

MOTHMAN	Sounds good! But we start with a churro, eh?

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

MS. EVANS	Welcome to Cranston's Genius of the Year Award Ceremony. And this year's award for discovering a new dimension and saving the whole school from total annihilation goes to Liz Fizzerton and Danny Dawkins.

(CLAPPING AND CHEERING)

DANNY 	Hi..

ALL	wooo!

DANNY	Oh, stop it.

PROFESSOR STERN	I always knew he had it in him.

DANNY	Thank you. The world tells us that geniuses are solo operators. But I've learnt that genius is something created by a group of great minds working together .


MOTHMAN	Hey, amigos!  Gracias! Thank you. I'm just so happy. It's so good to be back as part of the Cranston team. A ver, digan Quinta Dimensión.

ALL	Quinta dimensión

MOTHMAN	(GIGGLES) ¡Muy bien!

DANNY	Oh, man! T-t-t-that's your...

LIZ	Yup, that's my father. He wants you to have lunch with us later.

DANNY	Oooh. Wow. All that grant money was enough to fix the atomic particle reactor.

LIZ	Hey, do you think there's a sixth dimension?

MOTHMAN	There's only one way to find out.
