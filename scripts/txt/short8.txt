THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching..? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Thomas has lost his 'puff'. Paxton is trying to find it for him. But Stephen's not so sure Paxton has found it up in the sky.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	What did Paxton see in the sky? Was it a cloud?  Was it a feather? Or was it a sheep?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Yes, Paxton thought Thomas' lost puff was a cloud. Which did surprise Stephen! But Paxton realised his mistake and carried on looking.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Did you get it right! Oh, very well done! Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Thomas is a bright blue tank engine...

THE EARL OF SODOR	... JAMES is very proud of his shiny red paint.

THE EARL OF SODOR	And Charlie, well Charlie is my favorite colour.. Purple!

THE EARL OF SODOR	But what colour is Henry? Is Henry Blue? Is he red? Or is he green?

THE EARL OF SODOR	That's right Henry is the same colour as the grass or Dowager Hatt's outfit.. Yes, Henry is green!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Did you get it right! Oh, very well done! Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Percy is in a hurry today. He's rushing along the tracks! <gasp> But he's not looking where he's going.

PERCY	Aaah!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh dear, Percy. Now you have very sticky wheels!

THE EARL OF SODOR	What did Percy run over that made his wheels so sticky? Did he run over some jelly? Some pumpkins? Or some cake?

PERCY	"Oh no! Pumpkins on the line."

THE EARL OF SODOR	That's right! He ran over some Pumpkins. You'll need to go to the wash-down to get rid of that sticky mess, Percy.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Did you get it right? Jolly Well done! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	I think you deserve a 'REALLY USEFUL CERTIFICATE' for watching so closely!

THE EARL OF SODOR	... And I hope I'll see you again soon. Goodbye!
