JOHNNY	When my daughter was just a little girl, I promised to never leave her.  That was one promise I could not keep.
KANE	You’re late.
STEVEN	I had some shit I had to take care of.
KANE	She’s a ho, Steven.  Sooner you get that through your head, the better for you.
STEVEN	Just give me the money.
KANE	You are angry?  Is it because of me, or your ho?
KANE	After all this time together, you’re not trusting me?
KANE	This is our last transaction.  Got a better source.  Same grade, cheaper.
STEVEN	Jojo?  Oh Jesus Christ.  Jojo is small time, man.  His sources aren’t even stable.  I didn’t think you were this fucking stupid. 
KANE	He gave me the same exact grade as yours.
STEVEN	Probably because he got it from me.  He’s selling it to you for a low cost for now.  The price is going to come up, the quality’s going to go down.  He’s just a fucking small time piece of shit.  Got his hands in everything.  Girls, money.
KANE	Yeah, I know.  That’s how I met your girlfriend.  Angel, right?  

KANE	Oh.  What a fine piece of ass.  But don’t worry, it was like a couple years ago.  Before she met you.  When she was still fresh.  Jojo’s giving me 10 percent off your cut.  Take 5 and I’ll stick with you.
STEVEN	You take your 5 percent and go fuck yourself.
KANE	I don’t think you realize who you’re dealing with.
STEVEN	I know exactly who I’m talking to you, motherfucker.  Daddy’s little boy.
KANE	Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Hey you are one fast motherfucker.  But I still got a sniper out there.

STEVEN	10 percent is all it took for you to fuck me over.
KANE	Come on, man.  It’s business.
STEVEN	Yeah, it is business.  But what you said about Angel, that’s personal.
GIRL	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [PANTS HYSTERICALLY] [SCREAMS]
PETER	Act surprised, okay?  [SNIFFS] [GASPS] Ooh.  No, stupid.  Um.  [GASPS] How do you do this?
PLOY	Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes, here he comes.
CHILDREN+PLOY	Surprise!
PETER	Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
ALISA	Happy Birthday.
PLOY	Happy Birthday.  
PETER	All right.  Thank you.
PLOY	I hate being married to a detective.
ALISA	Your band sucks.
NOB	That’s ‘cause our lead singer can’t sing.
PETER	Then why is he the lead singer?
NOB	‘Cause it’s his studio.  And he owns all the equipment.  
PETER	Guess that makes sense.  Let’s say you skip your band practice tonight and have dinner with your old man.
NOB	Okay.
PETER	Great.
PLOY	You go ahead.  I’ll take the kids to school.
PETER	Thanks.  I’m en route.

MALE VOICE	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE IN BKGD] 
KARN	Happy 50th, old man.  Old woman found her.  Eurasian, late teens.  M.E. is working on time and cause of death.  It’s going to be difficult.
PETER	Anything else?
KARN	Nothing yet.  Divers are searching.  It’s going to take another couple hours.  Visibility down there is nil.
PETER	Give me a smoke, man.
KARN	It’s been like 4 years.
PETER	Just give me a cigarette.  Her name’s Angel.  No last name.
KARN	Everyone has a last name.
PETER	Not if your father’s a ghost.  I’m going to need a few personal days.
MALE VOICE	You have reached the Balloon Catering Service.  Please leave a message.
PETER	I’m in town.  Meet me at the usual place.
JOHNNY	Sorry, I couldn't resist.
PETER	I can’t believe they’ve turned this place into this.
JOHNNY	Yeah.  Well, the war’s been over for a long time, so.  A playground is better than a cemetery.
JOHNNY	So why are you here?  Something to tell me?
PETER	Angel’s dead.  Her body was discovered early yesterday morning off the river, Klong Bangkok Noi.  She was found naked.  Her wrists were bound.  I’m sorry.  
PETER	I have a plan.  I’ll head back and work the case.  And you follow in.  And stay off the radar.
JOHNNY	And then?
PETER	By the time you land, I should have some leads for us to start with.
JOHNNY	Your partner?
PETER	Yeah, he’s a good cop.  If there are any leads, he’ll have them.
JOHNNY	And then?
PETER	And then you do whatever you want.  But until we find the people responsible, you play by my rules.
JOHNNY	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] So, um, how is Ploy?
PETER	She’s doing well.  She’s a senior VP now.
JOHNNY	You know, you don't have to do this, Peter.  I can handle this myself, you know that.  I mean you got a family.  You got a--
PETER	Hey, we do this together.
JOHNNY	[NODS HEAD YES]
KARN	And your friend?  Is he coming?
MALE VOICE	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE IN BKGD] 
PETER	Yes.
KARN	I think his daughter was mixed up in a lot of grey stuff.
PETER	Her father and I were recruited by the CIA as locals.  We met during training.
KARN	Air America?
PETER	How fucking old do you think I am?  We became Americans.  And joined the military.  We came back 12 years later, became a cop.  And he went private.
KARN	Blackwater?
PETER	There's no such thing anymore.  What else do you have?
KARN	She has a titanium rod in her forearm.  Doc says it’s about a couple years old.  Only a few hospitals could do it.  So where’s your friend?
JOHNNY	I love you.
JOHNNY	Forgot how humid it gets here.
PETER	Meet my partner, Karn.  He’s tracked down some potential perps.  We’ve got 3.
JOHNNY	This guy.  Her boyfriend, or her friend’s boyfriend?
KARN	Her friend’s.  Crystal and Patrick.  She’s half Thai, he’s Turkish.  They’ve been living here for the past 6 years.
JOHNNY	She didn’t have a boyfriend?
KARN	Not one that I found, no.
PETER	Karn believes that the 2 will be in Khao Sarn tonight.  There are a couple of bars they like to frequent.  Johnny.
JOHNNY	I know.  
PETER	No you don't.
JOHNNY	I do know.  I’m very aware of where I am about to step into.
PETER	Now believe me, as a cop who’s been investigating sex crimes for 20 years, and a father of 3 young children, and as your friend.  Johnny, I know we’ve seen some dark shit.  But this is your own daughter.
JOHNNY	I understand.
PETER	Okay.  Karn, you track Crystal and Patrick.  I know where to track Steven now.
PETER	That’s him.
MALE VOICE	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
PETER	If we go in here, we go in hard.  These guys don’t fuck around.
GUARD	Can I help you?
KARN	I’m looking for a Crystal Logan, Room C23.
GUARD	Do you have a warrant?
GUARD	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
PETER	I’ll call for backup.
GANGSTER	Everything good?
STEVEN	I suppose.  Still quiet, yeah.
TON	Man, where have you been, eh?  Huh?  Jesus, you just don't fucking get it.  Do you know what we have sitting here?  It’s--
STEVEN	Hey, drop it.  How we looking?

STEVEN	I love you.
ANGEL	That’s sweet.
STEVEN	Sweet?  Yeah?  [YELLS INDISTINCTLY] fucking sweet.
PETER	All right.  Let’s split up.  Karn, you check out the other places. Welcome to Khao Sarn.  We’re going to meet someone how usually knows everything that goes on around here.
PETER	That’s her.
PETER	Excuse me.  May I sit down and ask you some questions?
JOY	I’m always happy to help the local police.  Please sit.
JOY	Your friend isn’t a cop.
PETER	No.  He’s not.
JOY	Who is he?
PETER	He’s my friend.
JOY	Am I being charged for anything or is this just a friendly chat?
PETER	It’s a friendly chat.
PETER	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
JOY	Crystal, Angel and Patrick.  Good kids.  All three of them.  Why is a high-ranking police officer looking for them?
PETER	How do you know them?
JOY	Answer my question please.
PETER	This is Angel’s father.  Her body was found three days ago.
JOY	I’m so sorry.
JOHNNY	You knew her well?
JOY	Angel was a lovely girl. I liked her a lot.
PETER	It’s, I liked her a lot.
JOHNNY	Thank you.  Can you help us?
JOY	Angel came to me three years ago.
PETER	Three years ago.
JOY	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  
PETER	She came to see me.
JOY	She was looking for customers.
PETER	She was looking for customers.
JOY	At first I sent her away, but she was persistent.
PETER	I chased her away.  But she was very stubborn.
JOY	She didn’t want any middle man.
PETER	She didn’t need any middle man.
JOHNNY	You mean pimps?
JOY	She wanted a quick way in.
PETER	She wanted a quick way in.  Did you hook her up?
JOY	No, but that didn’t stop her.
PETER	No, but that didn’t stop her.
JOHNNY	And you said you liked her.
JOY	[NODS HEAD YES] [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
JOHNNY	But you didn’t help her?
JOY	To be used by other men?
PETER	So she’d be used by men?
JOY	No.
PETER	No.
JOY	Did you know your daughter?
PETER	Do you know your daughter well?
JOY	What Angel wants…
PETER	Anything Angel wants…
JOY	…she has to get.
PETER	She has to get.  Did you give her your contacts?
JOY	I left that world a long time ago.  My contacts would be useless to her.
PETER	But you knew people?
JOY	I did. 
JOY	Angel did it herself.  I’ve never seen anyone move up in the trade so fast.
PETER	I’ve never seen anyone come in this fast.
JOY	Beautiful.
PETER	She’s a beautiful girl.
JOY	Very smart.
PETER	Very smart.  A lot of men came for her.
JOY	She had protection from bigwigs.
PETER	She had protection from the bigwigs.
JOY	But there was one that stood out.
PETER	But there was one that stood out.  And what was his name?
JOY	Jojo.  He operates around this area.
PETER	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
JOY	They like to target young back packers.
PETER	They do back packers and foreigners.
KARN	Nothing there.  A couple of regulars recognized them, but they didn’t really know who they were.  
MAN IN KNIT CAP	Hey excuse me. You guy-, you two look a bit lost.  How can I help you?
GIRL 1	We’re okay, thank you.
MAN IN KNIT CAP	Oh come on.  You look like you can use some coffee and a sandwich.   Hey, my friend have a restaurant over there.  If you change your mind, you can come to join me.  [Lo Pobo Zai?].
GIRL 1	What do you think?
GIRL 2	Why not?  It’s a public place.
JOHNNY	Hey.  How long before your flight leaves?  Your flight out of Bangkok?  How many days do you have to wait?
GIRL 1	3 days.
JOHNNY	Take it.  Go get yourself a decent room.  And order in, stay in until you have to leave for the airport.  Understood?
GIRL 2	[NODS HEAD YES]
JOHNNY	Take it.  Take it and go.
SAMMY	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]   
PETER	[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
SAMMY	What can I do you for gentlemen?
PETER	Do you know her?
SAMMY	Yeah, she comes around here all the time.  That’s, uh, Angel.  She’s usually with uh, Patrick and Crystal.
KARN	And when was the last time you saw them?
SAMMY	About a week ago.
PETER	And the other two?
SAMMY	Two or three days ago.
KARN	Angel wasn’t with them?
SAMMY	No.
PETER	You have a very good memory.
SAMMY	Yeah.  She’s a good kid.  Uh, I like her.  A bit lost sometimes, but she always pays her bills and never gives me any trouble.  When you own a bar that’s all you can ask from your customers.
PETER	Where can I find them?
SAMMY	I don't know.  You can try here later.
PETER	How much later?
SAMMY	Later.  You gonna close me down?
PETER	I just want to find Crystal and the boyfriend, ask a few questions.
SAMMY	What about Angel?
PETER	She’s dead.
SAMMY	Well, shame.  She was a nice kid.  Anything else I can do for you guys?
PETER	Thanks.
KARN	What about your friends?
PETER	Let’s go find them.
MUSIC	Day’s all right And the nights are black
STEVEN	Jojo, have you seen him?
GANGSTER	I haven't seen him for a couple of night.  
STEVEN	Well, when you see him, you let me know.
GANGSTER	Okay, sir.
MAN IN BASEBALL CAP	The fuck was that?
MAN IN KNIT CAP	I don't know, what the fuck is that, man?
MAN IN KNIT CAP	Two bitches coming.
MAN IN GREY SHIRT	Yeah?
MAN IN KNIT CAP	Yeah.
MAN IN BASEBALL CAP	Yeah?
MAN IN KNIT CAP	One blonde, and one I think brunette.  Don’t see them well.
MAN IN BASEBALL CAP	Make some money or what?
MAN IN KNIT CAP	Yeah. 
JOHNNY	I found Jojo.  Those other two worked with him.
PETER	I said under the fucking radar.  How am I going to cover this up?  Give me your gun.  I mean it, Johnny.  Your gun.  Now.  The other one, too.
JOHNNY	You want to pat me down?
KARN	The way I see it, Jojo got into an argument with his two friends, got shot.
JOHNNY	Jojo was not shot.  He had a heart attack.  His body is completely clean.  You’re not going to find any prints.  When Jojo works for a few establishments in Pat Pong, he recruits for them, him and his two other guys sometimes help breaking in the women that he recruits.  And you can find his iPhone on him with names, contacts, pictures, video clips. He said he knew Angel.  He said one of his bosses used to be her boyfriend.  A certain Khun Nate can be found at a bar called Badabing.
KARN	What?
PETER	I’m sorry.  You shouldn't be involved in this, man.
KARN	I work for the Royal Thai police force just like you.  I’m sworn to protect the city.  And as far as I’m concerned, it’s my job.  I’ll call it in.  I’ll take care of it.
PETER	You give him your weapon, I’ll have your badge.  Do you understand that?
KARN	Yes, sir.
PETER	Wherever he goes, I want you to go.  He takes a piss, I want you holding his fucking dick.  Do you understand?
KARN	Now can I trust you to stay in the car while I handle this?
JOHNNY	You have my word.
STEVEN	Bit of an incident.  Where is Jojo?  I want to talk to him.
JOY	Jojo won’t be a problem for us anymore.  You need to leave town until these feds are gone.  It could be bad for business.  Just for a couple of days.  Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it all.
KARN	Wait for me at one of those bars.  I’ll be back within 20 minutes.  I’ll see you in a few.
KARN	Miss, can I get a cola please?  Minimal but good security.  4 to 6 guys, about 20% capacity.  The music is extremely loud.  Look, I got a untraceable six-shooter in the glove compartment in the car.  There are armed men in there.  
JOHNNY	Yeah.  I know.  
KARN	I can’t go in there with you.  
JOHNNY	I know.  You’ve done more than enough.
KARN	I’m going to go get another Coke then.  I prefer it out of the can anyway.
MUSIC	Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my name  Huh, bitch better know my know my Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my know my

JOHNNY	I’m looking for Khun Nate.  Jojo sent me.  And he said that Khun Nate would have what I’m looking for.
SKINNY MAN	What is it that you’re looking for?
JOHNNY	Well, that’s between him and I.
SKINNY MAN	You think a couple of thousand baht can get you to see Khun Nate?
JOHNNY	Well, you think Jojo would send me here if all I had was a couple thousand bahts?  Hmm?  
MUSIC	Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my know my Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my name Bitch better know my know my
JOHNNY	Go get him.  Forget it.
SKINNY MAN	Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I’m sorry.  Got to be careful, you know.  If Jojo sent you you must be solid.  You know how we Thai men can be.
JOHNNY	Jojo is Japanese.
SKINNY MAN	Follow me.
SKINNY MAN	Wait here.
JOHNNY	Shut up.  I’m going to ask you a few questions.  And you better give it to me straight, you understand?  What was your relationship with Angel?
NATE	I’m in love with her.
JOHNNY	You’re married.  You love your wife, too?
JOHNNY	Was Angel in love with you?
JOHNNY	So you killed her?
NATE	What?  She’s dead?
JOHNNY	And you are?
NATE	He’s my father.
NATE	[GASPS]
JOHNNY	How long have you been seeing her?
NATE	Three years.
JOHNNY	Where did you meet her?
NATE	Uh, My Egg.  My Egg nightclub.  Uh, members only.  I was invited to this place.  You get a card, no names.  No numbers.  It’s the only way.  The, the card’s in my wallet.
JOHNNY	What kind of a club?
NATE	It’s a sex club.
PETER	Hello?
PETER	Not even 12 hours and you rack up 15 bodies. How the fuck do you do that?
JOHNNY	Don’t fucking touch me.  Okay?  Don’t.
JOHNNY	No.
PETER	Ow.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I put my job on the line for you.  I endangered the lives of my family.  And for what, you selfish son of a bitch?  Huh?  Do you realize what you’re doing to me?  Do you even fucking care?  [SPITS]  
JOHNNY	My daughter was a whore, Peter.  Do you know what that is doing to me?  Do you?
JOHNNY	So, good to finally meet you, Ploy.
PLOY	I’m so sorry for your loss.
JOHNNY	Me too.
ANNIE	Daddy!
PETER	Come here.  Ooh, baby.  Say hello to your Uncle Johnny.
ANNIE	Hello Uncle Johnny.  Are you my daddy’s friend?
JOHNNY	Yes, I am.  You must be Annie.
PLOY	Please.
ANNIE	Okay.
PLOY	Good girl, here.  
NOB	I need to eat your broccoli?
PLOY	You eat what’s on your plate.
PETER	 It’s time to go tell Sarah.
JOHNNY	Hello, Sarah.
SARAH	Johnny?
JOHNNY	Angel is dead.  She was murdered, Sarah.  
JOHNNY	Do you know why?
SARAH	How would I know that?
JOHNNY	You’re her mother.
SARAH	And you’re her father.  
JOHNNY	But I don't live in this country.
SARAH	No shit.  You know she moved out 2 years ago, right?  When was the last time you saw her ? Sometimes, sometimes I really miss you.  Do you miss me?
JOHNNY	No.
SARAH	Ironically, that’s the thing I miss the most about you.  You never lie.
JOHNNY	You packed your bags and left, Sarah.  Took my only child with you.  Why would I miss you?
JOHNNY	Please let me know about the funeral arrangements.
JOHNNY	I’d like to see her, just to, um…
PETER	Karn’s located the rest of the suspects.  We end this tonight.
PETER	Her friends are at Angel’s house.
JOHNNY	And these were her closest friends?
KARN	They’re holed up in a three bedroom house off of Klong Bangkok Yai.  It’s about 2 kilometers from where the body was discovered.
PETER	Hey, wake him up.
KARN	They’re up.
JOHNNY	I’m Angel’s father.  And this is her godfather.  You know my daughter, correct?
CRYSTAL	She, she’s my best friend.
JOHNNY	This is her house.  Where is she?
PETER	Where is she?
CRYSTAL	I don’t know.  I see her like, um, a week ago I--
PETER	Where?
CRYSTAL	She came to get some stuff.
PETER	What?
CRYSTAL	Some coke.
PETER	And that’s it?  And you haven’t seen her since?
CRYSTAL	No.
PETER	Yet you’re here at her place?
CRYSTAL	I have her keys.  She has my keys.
PETER	Because you’re friends?
CRYSTAL	Yeah.
JOHNNY	She’s dead.
CRYSTAL	How?
JOHNNY	She was murdered, her body dumped into these waters.  Found about a mile from here.
CRYSTAL	I’m sorry.
JOHNNY	Can you help us?
CRYSTAL	Anything.  
JOHNNY	Do you know anyone who would want my daughter dead?
CRYSTAL	A lot of guys were crazy about her, you know?  But she was a smart girl.  She, she knew her way around.  
JOHNNY	Did you work with her?
CRYSTAL	Yes.
PETER	Where you going?
PATRICK	I’m going to get some coffee.
JOHNNY	Sit down.
PETER	Now Crystal, we need names.
CRYSTAL	She had some regulars.  But no one special.
JOHNNY	Steven wasn’t special?
CRYSTAL	She liked the guy.  But she wasn’t in love.
JOHNNY	Who did she love?
CRYSTAL	I don't know.
JOHNNY	You don't know?  You’re her best friend.  How can you not know someone important in her life?
CRYSTAL	You’re her father.  I only just met you.  
PETER	Who is he Crystal?
CRYSTAL	It was Sammy.
PETER	Bangkok Bar Sammy?
CRYSTAL	He was the only one that she was in love with.  I don't know.  He didn’t even have that much money.
PETER	And that’s all that matters?
CRYSTAL	What else do men have to offer, huh?
JOHNNY	Thank you.  
CRYSTAL	I’m sorry.
KARN	Son of a bitch lied to me, man.  
PETER	Let’s go find out why.
JOHNNY	Did you kill my daughter?  Did you kill Angel? Did you?
SAMMY	I loved Angel with all my being.  This whole situation is a mistake.  I have nothing against either one of you.
PETER	You just killed my partner.
SAMMY	You and me, we’re very much alike.  I lost my daughter when she was 15 years old.  Her name was Lisa.  She was on holiday in Manila at the time with her mother.  I was in Kosovo with my regiment. Day after day, month after month, year after year I was always a step behind.  And I never saw my little girl again.  So I understand your loss.  I wake up every morning hoping that maybe, just maybe today will be the day that I hear her voice one more time. And then I go to bed at night wondering if she’s out there being raped for the thousandth time.  No father should have to go through that.
PETER	Except while you’re making a fortune out of the very thing that destroyed your daughter.  
SAMMY	I honor her memory by protecting these women, these women that the very fabric of society was built upon with or without me.  Men will always use the backs of women for their own gratification.  There's a reason this is the oldest fucking business in the world.  I elevate these women.  You can ask any one of my girls.
SAMMY	I treat them all with respect.  I loved Angel so much.  I treated her better than my own daughter.
PETER	You broke her arm.
SAMMY	That was a mistake.  
PETER	You seem to be making a lot of them.
SAMMY	That was an accident.
PETER	And like Angel.
SAMMY	I didn’t kill Angel.  
PETER	Of course not.  You only snapped her arm.
SAMMY	She was fucking another man in my home.
JOHNNY	So she deserves to die?  Hmm?
SAMMY	No.  I tried to protect her.  I did everything I could.  She was so young, so beautiful, so fragile.  But she was too smart for her own good.  I did the best I could for her.
JOHNNY	Like you did for Lisa.  Look at me.  Look at me.  You better kill me now.  ‘Cause if you don’t, I’m going to hunt you down and I’m going to kill you.  You understand?
SAMMY	Gentlemen, I hope I never see either one of you ever again.
JOHNNY	Wait.  Do you know how she died?
SAMMY	Yeah.  I do.
PETER	Oh, God.  
PETER	We’re going to get him.  
JOHNNY	Did Karn have a family?
PETER	Yeah, a mother in California.
JOHNNY	He was right, Peter.  If I didn’t want to be found, could you find me?
PETER	No, but you can.
PETER	Now what?
JOHNNY	One last place.  My Egg.

VERONICA	Of course there is.  It will be half a million for the both of you.

JOHNNY	Don't tell me.  You’re another one who loved her, too?
STEVEN	She’s dead?  How?
JOHNNY	Murdered.
STEVEN	And you think I did it?
JOHNNY	She was seeing someone else.
STEVEN	I was the someone else.
JOHNNY	You okay with all that?
STEVEN	You fucked up as a father and now your daughter’s dead.  Are you okay with that?
JOHNNY	You’re going to tell me everything you know about Angel.
STEVEN	Why don't you put your gun down and see if you can beat it out of me.
VERONICA	[BREATHES HEAVILY]
JOHNNY	You are going to tell me everything you know about Angel.
STEVEN	Fuck you.
JOHNNY	This is going to hurt.
VERONICA	Okay, okay.  Please.
JOHNNY	Tell me about Angel.
VERONICA	She used to work here.  But she left over years ago.  We don't have anything to do with her.
JOHNNY	You recruited her?
VERONICA	No.  She came to me on her own.  And then she left.
JOHNNY	So you just let her go?
VERONICA	She knows people.
JOHNNY	She knew people.
VERONICA	I liked her.
JOHNNY	You think this fancy dress can hide a country girl from Vietnam?  Who would want to kill her?  Who?! 
VERONICA	I don't know.  Many people liked her.  She’s the kind of woman that all men kill for.  You men are simple creatures.  She understood that.  She used it.  She knows how to use men better than anyone I’ve seen.  She met someone.
JOHNNY	Who?
VERONICA	I don't know.  But it changed her.
JOHNNY	How did he change her?
VERONICA	She left this place.  Almost all her clients complained she dumped them.  They spent more time and money here in the hopes they’d find a replacement.  They never could.  No one was like Angel.  What are you going to do now?
JOHNNY	You’re not going to wake up with a hangover either.  
PETER	I need you to fix up my friend.
MIKHAEL	Peter.  You come see me after so long time, eh?
PETER	Hello Mikhael.
MIKHAEL	Mickey.  How many time I tell you call me Mickey?  Like the little mouse, da?  You bring friend.  Look like he make someone’s husband angry, eh?  Oh, it’s not knife.  Ice pick?
MIKHAEL	Oh, you Black Ops all the same, eh?  So tough.  Fucking Rambo, eh?  Drink.  Helps.  
JOHNNY	[CHUGS FROM BOTTLE]
MIKHAEL	I don't give this to Rambo.
MIKHAEL	My own concoction.  He sleep for an hour, he feel nothing.  But when he wake up, you give him this.  Painkiller.  Take all four.  You have to disinfect all the way through.
MIKHAEL	[HUMS SOFTLY]
MIKHAEL	I’m surprised you have not heard from our friend yet.
PETER	Why?
MIKHAEL	Because she owns the club you destroy last night.
JOHNNY	Feels better.
PETER	It should.  He knows what he’s doing.
JOHNNY	Russian?  Thought you left that world when you came back here.
PETER	We better get going.
JOHNNY	Where to?
PETER	 You remember where I get my information?
PETER	You lied to us.
JOHNNY	So the noodle bar is just a front?
PETER	You better tell us what we want to hear or we’ll shut down everything, including the noodle bar.  What’s your connection to Steven?
JOY	He was my business partner.
JOHNNY	He left you for my daughter?
JOY	If that were the case, she would have been dead a long time ago.  And you would have never found her body.  But I did not kill her.  She was like a sister to me.  
JOHNNY	What do you want?
JOY	I need you to leave Bangkok.  You have made things really difficult for me.
JOHNNY	What do you want in exchange?
JOY	Will you want to know how Angel died?
JOHNNY	You know how Angel died?
PETER	No she doesn’t.
JOY	I have it on tape.  Sammy uploaded a clip from Patrick’s phone onto his laptop.
PETER	Do you know where it is?
JOY	In the car.
JOY	Johnny.  This isn’t your fault.
MUSIC	Silent whisper See where minds go And we’re drifting, letting go You and I Day light fading As we lay there Breathe out Shadow hands are turning in the fading At night
As we lay there Breathe out As we lay there Breathe out
CRYSTAL	Oh no, breathing.  She isn’t, she isn’t breathing.  She isn’t breathing, she. No.  Uh, she’s…no.
