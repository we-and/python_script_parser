(SCARLETT)



SUPPORT TECH	Multiple hostiles around the perimeter. Heavy concentration of civilians inside.	 Watch your back. Interior has guards on the move.

BAINUM	Of course. That might be difficult to arrange, for those terms. (beat) Let me know. Put it down.

CAL	You first.

GUARD 1	(foreign language) Stop! Hands up!

NURSE	Our pretend patient of the day here is Kendall, and he needs an IV. You'll be doing IVs so many times a day, you'll start dreaming of it. So, who would like to try?

KENDALL	Try?

NURSE	Relax.

SCARLETT	I'll do it.

KENDALL	Ow.

NURSE	Good. I hope you all could see that, but let's walk through the steps again. It's important before you reach for that needle to make sure you have all the equipment you need, and then to have a plan. I can't tell you how many students I've seen get trigger-happy with the needle, and that just means blood and unhappy patients Okay, last chance--we leave for Cabo tomorrow.

SCARLETT	Thanks, but no.

NATASHA	Come on, it's spring break. Get out of this cold!

SCARLETT	I should catch up on some papers—

NATASHA	Boring. At least don't stay here the whole break. Use that train ticket your dad sent you and go home—

SCARLETT	No way. He's the last person I want to see.

NURSE	Using the correct gauge for the IV is pivotal--isn't it, Scarlett?

SCARLETT	Yes. Generally, between a 14-25 gauge, depending on the age and size of the patient. The 25 range would be for children.

NURSE	Moving on. Embolisms--how to eliminate air bubbles in the IV line.

NATASHA	Sell the train ticket and go somewhere fun then.

SCARLETT	I could. But I'm staying here. 

CASHIER	$11.74.

SCARLETT	Is there something wrong with this? 

CASHIER	It's saying it's denied. 

SCARLETT	Denied?

CASHIER	Nope.

SCARLETT	Uh...

CASHIER	That's not enough.

SCARLETT	Thanks, I realize that.

ANNOYED COLLEGE KID	Hurry up!

NATASHA	I have some cash. It's not a big deal. 

SCARLETT	I know I have enough room on my cards. I'll pay you back. If I ever get off hold here...

NATASHA	Don't worry about it. Oh! Or, let's do something fun, and we'll call it even. Dancing. Let's do that.

SCARLETT	Yes, I'm still here. (beat, relieved) Good, so it's not --(beat) The co-signer froze the account? How do I unfreeze it? (beat) He has to do it. Fine. Thanks for your help. 

NATASHA	Everything okay?

SCARLETT	You know what? Dancing sounds great. 

NATASHA	Yeah?

SCARLETT	Why not.

UNKNOWN MAN	Got him. (beat) Yeah.

NATASHA	Come on, let it go. 

SCARLETT	This is a new low, even for him. 

NATASHA	I don't get why though. 

SCARLETT	He wants me to come home. 

NATASHA	Just tell him there's no way you're going to do that.

SCARLETT	That means talking to him. This is his way of forcing me.

NATASHA	Wow, I thought my dad was crazy. 

SCARLETT	There are degrees. Mine is... beyond.

NATASHA	Forget about it then.

LIAM	Hey. I'm Liam.

SCARLETT	Hi.

LIAM	For you.

SCARLETT	Thanks, but I'm fine.

LIAM	A little light, isn't that? Here. You'll love it. I even got one of the umbrellas in it for you.
	
NICK	Hey man. Can we join you?

LIAM	Yeah! This here is--uh—

SCARLETT	Not Interested.

NICK	Feisty, huh?	

LIAM	This is Nick, Caden and Matthew. 

SCARLETT	Can I have my water back?

LIAM	Sure.

NICK	Whoa, wait.

LIAM	No need to run off. 

SCARLETT	I'd like to go. 

LIAM	Please, sit.

SCARLETT	You boys have a good night.

LIAM	Listen, just tell us your name.

SCARLETT	You all have had too much of something. Leave me alone.

NICK	No one should be alone. Stay. Things are only going to get better.

SCARLETT	I doubt that.

LIAM	Come'ere --

NICK	Hey!

CADEN	Stupid psycho--ah!!

CAL	You did good. The officer said there were 4 of them. You defended yourself. 

SCARLETT	Stop.

CAL	Honey, it's not like you killed them. They deserved it.

SCARLETT	That's not what the police report says. It's their word--4 of them--against me.

CAL	It doesn't matter—

SCARLETT	Yeah it does. I used a sleeper hold on one of them. I could have killed him. And it's your fault.

CAL	Scarlett, if you hadn't known how to—

SCARLETT	Dad, stop. I didn't just defend myself. I'm the freak who leveled four guys without a scratch. Who does that?!

CAL	You know I'm not mad, right? 

SCARLETT	No, you're proud. What type of parent are you? You froze my credit cards. Did you think that was funny?

CAL	You've ignored me for months. 

SCARLETT	I'm having you removed as a co-signer on my accounts.

CAL	I wanted to see you. 

SCARLETT	You've seen me. Take me back to campus now.

CAL	It's your spring break. We're going home.

SCARLETT	I have studying to catch up on.

CAL	I doubt it. Come on. It's been ... it's been too long since you were home.

SCARLETT	Not long enough.

CAL	Scarlett. Wake up. We're home. 

SCARLETT	You changed the code again.

CAL	You hungry? I can—

SCARLETT	No.

CAL	Scarlett--Good morning. Cereal? Or I can make something. Did you sleep okay? 

SCARLETT	Yeah, fine. The milk's gone bad.

CAL	Oh. Yeah. Sorry. I was out of town. I'll get some groceries later.

SCARLETT	(challenging) So how was your trip?  Business good?
 
CAL	I got you something. Kind of a late birthday present.

SCARLETT	You're kidding. 

CAL	What? I thought it was unique. And the balance is pretty good too.  The blade is—

SCARLETT	Sharp? What was wrong with clothes? Music? Gift cards!

CAL	Come on, you can get those anytime. This is special.

SCARLETT	To you. I'm going for a walk. 

CAL	I'll come—

SCARLETT	(sharply) No thanks. What?

CAL	Don't come home.

SCARLETT	What?

CAL	Go to Grandma's house.

SCARLETT	Dad, what's going on?

CAL	Remember what I taught you.

SCARLETT	What was that?

CAL	Don't waste time calling anyone. Just get to grandma's house, got it? 

SCARLETT	What about you?

CAL	Go, Scarlett.

SCARLETT	Dad?  Dad! Dad?
	
MCDOWELL	Got her! There!	
 


WALKER	See her?
	
MCDOWELL	I don't know.

WALKER	Maybe she...

MCDOWELL	What?

WALKER	I...
	
MCDOWELL	Split up.

CAL	Remember what I taught you.

YOUNG SCARLETT	Dad!

CAL	Real quick, Scarlett.  Where's grandma's house?

YOUNG SCARLETT	Again?
	
CAL	Humor me. What's the address?
	
YOUNG SCARLETT	19 Boarcrest Road, in Cayhill, wherever that is.

CAL	You can look up directions.  What's grandma's house for?

YOUNG SCARLETT	Can I finish the show—
	
CAL	Scarlett.

YOUNG SCARLETT	If there's ever an emergency, you'll tell me to go there—

CAL	Where?

YOUNG SCARLETT	--to grandma's house. 

CAL	And you wait there till I come for you.

YOUNG SCARLETT	Why do you call it that when I don't have any grandmothers left?

CAL	That's exactly why I call it that. We'll be safe there, if we ever need it.

SCARLETT	Hello? (hopeful) Dad? (whispering) He's not coming.
 
CAL	Come on, catch up. You have to be able to outrun someone if you're ever in trouble.

SCARLETT	Or I could call the police.

CAL	We've talked about this before. 

SCARLETT	You know you're the only parent who encourages their daughter NOT to dial 9-1-1.

CAL	If you hurt yourself, or if there's a fire, fine. Call them. But if it's another dangerous situation, don't. Just defend yourself and get away.

SCARLETT	Because you don't want the questions. Like, "gee, Dad.  Where did you go last week?"

CAL	You know I can't tell you that. 

SCARLETT	Sure. All I'm allowed to know is you work for the government and carry a gun.  Fine.(beat) How is Syria this time of year? 

CAL	Cut it out.

SCARLETT	What?  You can't stop me from watching the news and guessing.
 
CAL	Scarlett—

SCARLETT	I get it.  Don't call the police. Whatever.

CAL	Good sprint!
 	
SCARLETT	Hello?

WOLF LEADER	You must be Scarlett.
	
SCARLETT	Who is this?

WOLF LEADER	I'm the man who has your father. 

SCARLETT	I want to talk to him.

WOLF LEADER	And I bet he's dying to talk to you too, Red. I'd love to reunite the two of you. So do me a favor.  Just sit tight, all right?  We'll come pick you upso you can see your father. She 

SCARLETT	What are you doing?

MCDOWELL	Stop there! Enough.  Throw it away.

WALKER	She shot me!

MCDOWELL	You'll live.

SCARLETT	Where's my dad?

GARZA	Probably dead.
	
SCARLETT	Why did you take him? Who are you? Who do you work for? Tell me!

GARZA	You're weak.

SCARLETT	And I beat you. Where's my dad?

GARZA	I tell you nothing.

SCARLETT	Where is he!

GARZA	I'm going to rip out your hair and make you eat it.

SCARLETT	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Last chance. Where is my father? 

GARZA	Don't hurt yourself with that.	(smug)	You won't shoot.

SCARLETT	Don't tempt me.

CAL	Better. More natural, isn't it? Now, eyes on the target.
	
YOUNG SCARLETT	Okay.
	
CAL	Ready to take the safety off? Remember what we've talked about Both eyes open, always. Aim. Breathe evenly.  Time the shot with your breath for greater accuracy.	 Good. Fire when you're ready.	
	
SCARLETT	I had plans, you know.

CAL	Vaguely hanging out with a guy who has a stud in his tongue and who knows where else -- not plans.

SCARLETT	This--is probably going to get me in trouble. Like everything else...

CAL	Not if you know what you're doing. Come on, this is quality bonding time.

SCARLETT	And we do it a lot more than I get to go out and do normal things.

CAL	This, here, gets me the Cool Dad of the Year award.

SCARLETT	You're way out of touch with what I think is cool.
	
CAL	You sure you don't want to shoot some more?

SCARLETT	Very.

CAL	Okay. That's fine. You're getting better. The spacing here is tight. If we keep it up, I bet you can—

SCARLETT	I don't want to keep it up or keep coming here and being someone I'm not. The keys, Dad.

CAL	Scarlett, don't—

SCARLETT	What? Don't what? Live? 

CAL	I know this is unusual to you—

SCARLETT	Doubt it.

CAL	But it makes you safer. 

SCARLETT	How? You think because I can shoot at a pinned up paper target I can shoot a person? Why would I even want to shoot a person?

CAL	You never know what you might need to do.

SCARLETT	Why would you even want this for me? 

CAL	I want you safe. That's all. 

SCARLETT	Gee, I guess I'm just glad I'm not locked in the house. I mean, I get to see sunlight. Pretty awesome.
 


CAL	Cut it out. This isn't easy for me. 

SCARLETT	What isn't?

CAL	Raising you. Being... a dad, and away and worrying about you. I wish your mom was still around, but you're stuck with me.

SCARLETT	You worry about me but you're gone on and off three-fourths of the year or more. If you're so worried, why not, I don't know, remarry? Have a girlfriend?

CAL	It's too late for that. 

SCARLETT	Too late for a lot of things. 

CAL	I don't trust anyone. Not that much. I won't risk us, letting someone into our lives like that.

SCARLETT	I thought you were a decent judge of character. Why not give up your job then? Wouldn't that be better for us? No more secrets. No more me not knowing what you're doing, and you worrying about me.

CAL	(beat) This is what I'm good at. Someone has to do it.

SCARLETT	So let someone else do it.

CAL	Doesn't matter what I do. I'd never stop worrying about you. I'll drive.
	
MCDOWELL	Get up.

GARZA	Where's Walker?
	
WOLF LEADER	The girl?

GARZA	(hesitant, heavy accent) She got away. Walker's dead.
	
WOLF LEADER	You underestimated her. (beat) Get back here. I have another option. 

GARZA	Okay.

MCDOWELL	Help me with the body.

CAL	Okay, how do you tell if someone is following you?

SCARLETT	What?

CAL	How do you tell?

SCARLETT	Dad, not now.

CAL	Check your mirrors. If you see the same car and it's following you, he'll turn when you do.

SCARLETT	We're just going to dinner. 

CAL	He'll try to match your speed. 

SCARLETT	I'm a bit old for a driving lesson. 

CAL	Come on, this is important.

SCARLETT	That's what you always say. 

CAL	What if you have some stalker boyfriend? How do you tell if he's following?

SCARLETT	Should have ordered pizza. (to herself) Follow too close, and you'll be seen. She Just because he moves, doesn't mean I have to. (beat) If he speeds up suddenly, he's spotted me...

OLOSKI	Ready for more?
 	
GARZA	Sanches. That you?	 Sanches? Dawson?
	
OLOSKI	Go. You'll tell me. One way or another. She Where did he put it?

CAPTURED MAN	(muffled)	 I don't know.  I swear, man, come on...
 
OLOSKI	Try again.

CAPTURED MAN	Ow! Please--I've told you all I know about Cal.

OLOSKI	Not enough. Let's see if you remember anything  else.

	
CAPTURED MAN	No, come on--I'm telling you—

OLOSKI	Where is the vial? The Cetus virus? How well can you tolerate pain?

SCARLETT	Let him go.

CAPTURED MAN 	Yeah, please.

OLOSKI	Shut up. (to Scarlett) You're outnumbered. 

SCARLETT	I don't think so.  Drop the knife. Now!

OLOSKI	No.

SCARLETT	Don't. Move. Against the wall. 

CAPTURED MAN	Yeah, you heard her. Who are you?

SCARLETT	Is my dad here?

CAPTURED MAN	What?

SCARLETT	Cal, you said—

CAPTURED MAN	Behind you! How do we get out of here?! 

SCARLETT	I'm working on it!

CAPTURED MAN	Working on it?! What type of rescue is this?

SCARLETT	I wasn't trying to rescue you.

CAPTURED MAN	Might want to hurry. What's the plan?

SCARLETT	Where's Cal?

CAPTURED MAN	I don't know!

SCARLETT	Come on. Hurry.

CAPTURED MAN	Ow--Thanks.  For, you know... 

SCARLETT	Yeah.

SEAN	I'm Sean.

SCARLETT	Scarlett.

SEAN	Cal's your dad? 

SCARLETT	Have you seen him? 

SEAN	No, they must have him somewhere  else.

SCARLETT	Where? You had to have heard something.

SEAN	I didn't—

SCARLETT	Anything?!

SEAN	No, sorry--

SCARLETT	(beat, calming down) You okay?

SEAN	I'll bounce back. All Cal's fault  anyway. Dragging me into this...(muttering) Nice
	
SCARLETT	Here.

SEAN	Thanks.

SCARLETT	How do you know my dad?

SEAN	I've helped find him some information. 

SCARLETT	How?

SEAN	In a semi-legal way that may or may not involve code and the internet.  (beat) You know what he does, right? 

SCARLETT	I have an idea. 

SEAN	I told him about some info I'd come across. A biological weapon being some weird name, Cetus? Cal went after whatever he could find about it.

SCARLETT	So what are you? An informant? 

SEAN	(shrugs) Something like that.
	
SCARLETT	And those guys? 

SEAN	Arms dealers, I think. 

SCARLETT	How did they get to you? 

SEAN	I don't know. One minute I'm chilling, having coffee and the next, they grab me and start --You were the last person I expected to come, all--(he gestures a punch)--You know.

SCARLETT	Who were you expecting?
 
SEAN	Cal's associates?  Other agents?  I don't know. I didn't think they'd actually take him down.

SCARLETT	What do you mean?
 
SEAN	Not "down," but catch up with him. I didn't know, but whatever I told them must have been enough to track—

SCARLETT	You told them about my dad?  It was you?

SEAN	Hey, I didn't have a choice! 

SCARLETT	They came after us because of you! 

SEAN	Sorry, I'm not all trained to handle this! (muttering) I'm in over my head. 

SCARLETT	You're going to help me get my dad back.

SEAN	Hey!

SCARLETT	You owe him.

SEAN	Owe him?  He got me in this mess! 

SCARLETT	I thought you were the one who told him about it. Besides, you betrayed him. You put him in danger, and me too. Now you're going to help me get him back.

SEAN	I hate to break it to you, but this intimidation thing doesn't work as well for you as it does for your dad. You're holding a 50-cent bandage over my head? Very convincing--I've totally changed my mind.

SCARLETT	It doesn't look too deep. 

SEAN	You think so?

SCARLETT	(quieter) Did you see him at all? 

SEAN	No. (softens) Hey. He's tough. He'll survive. 

SCARLETT	I'm the only one looking for him. Train station is up ahead. 

SEAN	Drop me off up there.  That's good enough.

SCARLETT	Here. Might not draw as much attention as that.

SEAN	You should run. I would--I am. 

SCARLETT	That's your choice. 

SEAN	Okay. Look, whatever these guys are looking for, this virus thing or whatever Cal has--maybe that's your ticket out.  Find it, swap it for him... you know?

SCARLETT	Unless it's labeled "deadly virus," I don't know what I'm looking for. 
	And if it's that big a deal...

SEAN	How will you get to Cal? 

SCARLETT	I'll figure it out.

SEAN	Look, if I knew something, I'd totally help. It's just—

SCARLETT	I know. I get it. 

SEAN	I mean, I owe you one. 

SCARLETT	(sincerely) Don't lose sleep over it.

SEAN	(sighs) I must be crazy. Cozy.

SCARLETT	Yeah.

SEAN	Family vacation spot? Oooh, safe house?  Nice.	
 
SCARLETT	Careful.

SEAN	He's got everything. Are those grenades? So did he come here recently? 
	
SCARLETT	I don't know.

SEAN	Maybe the thing's here. Have you checked?

SCARLETT	Wouldn't he turn it over to someone else?

SEAN	Depends. Come on, let's look around. 

SCARLETT	Where? I mean, if it's a biological weapon, where's he going to put it-- the fridge? I really doubt it.

SEAN	Those guys were asking me about Cal, and how well I knew him.  They talked like he knew where it was. So for whatever reason, they think he's  still got it somewhere.

SCARLETT	It doesn't do any good if I can't find it.

SEAN	Hey, I'll help. It's cool. We'll figure it out.

SCARLETT	And then?

SEAN	You decide. But we'll get Cal back. She Your dad has issues. Ah. I'm willing to open this to make sure Cal didn't stash anything inside. 
	
SCARLETT	We don't have time for that. 
	
SEAN	Yeah we do. I need food. Haven't eaten in, like, two days. Mmmm. I know this don't taste good but I don't even care. Come on. Cal stocked up. There's a macaroni thing here, granola, beef stew.

SCARLETT	My dad is--

SEAN	He'd want you to be strong enough when you find him. Eat. So you work for your dad? 
	
SCARLETT	What? No.

SEAN	Oh. You just know how to handle yourself, so	

SCARLETT	(shrugs) My Friday nights were different than most growing up.

CAL	Tired?

SCARLETT	No.

CAL	You're lagging. Don't stop. That was great. 
	
SCARLETT	I take it back. I'm tired.
	
CAL	Five more minutes. What's on your mind? 

SCARLETT	Nothing.

CAL	I know that's never true. You're humoring me. Come on. What is it? 
	
SCARLETT	Have you killed anyone?
	
CAL	I can't talk about--
	
SCARLETT	(angrily) Figures.


CAL	Why do you want to know? 

SCARLETT	I think I should, don't you? What do you think you're always training me for?

CAL	Not to kill.

SCARLETT	Really? You sure? 
	
CAL	If it came to it, I'd rather it be the other guy and not you. But it's for your protection.

SCARLETT	Right. You didn't answer my question.

CAL	Calm down! Yes.

SCARLETT	(trying to be unaffected) How many?

CAL	I won't tell you that.

SCARLETT	Doesn't it bother you? 

CAL	Not as much as it should.

SEAN	So Cal never told me about you. 

SCARLETT	Didn't think you were close. Isn't everything super secret all the time? 

SEAN	(shrugs) Just you and him then? 

SCARLETT	My mom died when I was 8. 

SEAN	Because of his work? 

SCARLETT	What? No. She got sick. 

SEAN	So he raised you, huh? 

SCARLETT	If you can call it that. (beat) What about you? 

SEAN	What about me?

SCARLETT	I don't know anything about you, other than you've worked with my dad.

SEAN	Grew up under less than ideal circumstances. A few brushes with the law with my computer skills... But came out all right. I've gotten good at getting out of scrapes. Hey, I have my off days. (beat) I'm more of a middle man for information now. That's how I met your dad. I thought it'd be a safer gig. What are you doing? 

SCARLETT	Making a deal. I'm telling them I'll get what they want. My dad for the vial, or I'll go to the police.

SEAN	What's it say?

SCARLETT	"You have till tomorrow night, or we'll drop off his body for the cops."

SEAN	So what now? Are you expecting any--

SCARLETT	That car, it was outside the house. 

SEAN	It's them. Has to be. Stay down!
	
UNKNOWN MAN	I know you're here. Come out, hands up.

 


SCARLETT	Behind you!

SEAN	Let her go!

UNKNOWN MAN	Drop the gun!

SEAN	No way! You first or your guy gets--

UNKNOWN MAN	(to Armed Man #3) Wait!

SEAN	No, get out! Go!

SCARLETT	Sean!

SEAN	Come on! You okay? You're hurt.

SCARLETT	Who--who were they? 

SEAN	The guys who have your dad. 

SCARLETT	But how did they find us? I told them I'd find what they want and then they attacked—Does that mean they killed my dad? 

SEAN	No. No, don't think that. 

SCARLETT	Those men are dead. Pull over.

SEAN	Hang on. Come here. This is going to sting. You did what you had to do. Those men would have killed us. 

SCARLETT	Yeah.

SEAN	You did what Cal would want you to. 

SCARLETT	I know.

SEAN	He saved my life once, actually. 

SCARLETT	He did?

SEAN	I was in Dublin. I was meeting up with this group, but they weren't who I thought they were. I figured it out a little late.

SCARLETT	What'd you do?

SEAN	I got away but they ... well, I got shot. So, I'm on the run, but I don't know  what I'm doing. I called Cal--didn't expect him to actually answer or do anything, but I had no other options. He'd told me once he owed me, so this was me hoping he'd come through.  He did.

SCARLETT	What happened?

SEAN	They tracked me down. I'm on the stone floor of this church, staring  at a barrel of a gun and thinking, "this is it." And then, Cal shows up. Saves me. He says it was luck he happened to be in London, close enough to reach me before... but he didn't have to come at all. (shrugs) He patched me up, told me I was an idiot--And then got me out of there. 

SCARLETT	My dad had a lot of last-minute trips come up. It was never a good time,  and I never got a say in him going or staying. (beat) I hated it. 
	(beat) But... I'm glad he was there. 

SEAN	So you two aren't close? 

SCARLETT	Not lately.

SEAN	What changed?

SCARLETT	It got to be too much.

CAL	I got you into a nice program—

SCARLETT	Don't act like you're doing me a favor.  You stuck me in a community college that was close to you.
	
CAL	Look, things are a little tricky right now, and I don't want you across the country—

SCARLETT	That's your life, not mine! Do you know how hard it was to get in the nursing tract at school?

CAL	I know you worked hard, but this new college--

SCARLETT	All that work, the studying, the midnight cramming for exams in a cadaver lab--just so YOU can screw it up with YOUR job.

CAL	It's for your own good. 

SCARLETT	Sure, Dad. Then why not let me stay at a university that has a reputation, that I worked hard to get into?!
	
CAL	Because someone might... It's  complicated. The lower profile, the better.

SCARLETT	Great. So you transferred me without	asking me, and I don't even get to know the reason why other than "It's	for my own good."
	
CAL	Will you go? 

SCARLETT	I'll go. But I'm done after this. I'm not coming back.

CAL	Scarlett—

SCARLETT	What if they're watching? 

SEAN	You told them you'd get it.

SCARLETT	Yeah but then they attacked us.

SEAN	They still might have your dad. 

SCARLETT	I hope it's here. This is the only other place I know to look.

SEAN	Let's go then. You want me to watch out here? Just in case?

SCARLETT	Yeah. Thanks. I mean it. Thank you. For 	
	
SEAN	Hey. It's cool. (beat) I'm glad I'm here. Hey. Be careful. Hey, everything okay? Whoa, just me.

SCARLETT	My dad brought me back a gift. 

SEAN	What was it?

SCARLETT	A knife.

SEAN	He got you a knife for your birthday? 

SCARLETT	He thought it was special. What if it was?

SEAN	Where is it?

SCARLETT	I don't know. It was here before they attacked. Maybe they have it. 

SEAN	If they did, they wouldn't have come after you.

SCARLETT	I'll check upstairs.

SEAN	Anything?

SCARLETT	Still looking.

SEAN	I haven't found anything here. You okay? Come on, Red, did you find it? 

WOLF LEADER	I'm the man who has your father. 

SCARLETT	I want to talk to him.

WOLF LEADER	And I bet he's dying to talk to you too, Red.

SCARLETT	No, not yet. Hey, check the drawers in the kitchen. He might have put it with the steak knives.
 


SEAN	What are you doing? 

SCARLETT	Don't come any closer. 

SEAN	Did I miss something? 

SCARLETT	You're him.

SEAN	Who?

SCARLETT	On the phone. You have my dad. 

SEAN	What?!

SCARLETT	Don't move.

SEAN	Scarlett, just--easy. Put the gun down. Okay? Now just think. (beat) How--why would I-- I don't even know what to say. This is not how I wanted things to end.

SCARLETT	Where's my dad?! 

SEAN	Alive. Where's the knife? 

SCARLETT	Get off me!

SEAN	Calm down.

SCARLETT	I trusted you.

SEAN	That was the idea.

SCARLETT	Why? Why pretend—

SEAN	Your dad wasn't cooperating, and I have buyers waiting. I needed you to find the virus.

SCARLETT	Is he alive?

SEAN	Technically. I told him about some info I'd come across. A biological weapon being sold, a virus. Those men called it some weird name, Cetus? (answering) Scarlett. You must miss me.

SCARLETT	I'll trade.

SEAN	Good. And I thought there'd be hard feelings between us.

SCARLETT	I want my dad back, unharmed.

 


SEAN	Then come get him. You don't have a choice and we both know it.

SCARLETT	I want to talk to him. 

SEAN	No.

SCARLETT	How do I know he's okay? 

SEAN	Ask a question and I'll ask him for the answer.

SCARLETT	What type of fish did he buy me when I was eight?

SEAN	He never bought you a fish. 

SCARLETT	You try to pull anything, and I swear I'll put all my weight into making you pay.

SEAN	What, all 90 pounds of it? Enough with the threats, Red.

SCARLETT	Don't call me that.

SEAN	That's what gave me away, wasn't it? 

SCARLETT	Where do I go?

SEAN	Looks like I got a date. Did you know where the virus was the whole time? Or was it luck that you stole it before I could? Kind of cold. Planting something so dangerous on your daughter. So you didn't know. 
	(beat) It was in the knife you gave her. She figured it out. Sharp girl. Beautiful too. Tell me: When she comes, would you rather I kill her ... or keep her?

FEMALE STUDENT	Hey, were you in Lehrman's class today?

SCARLETT	No, sorry.

FEMALE STUDENT	Oh. I'm lost on this lab assignment
	
SCARLETT	Good luck.

GARZA	She's here.	

OLOSKI	Hands up.

SCARLETT	There's a cooler in the back seat.

MCDOWELL	No needles this time.

SCARLETT	Where is my dad?

CAL	Scarlett—

SCARLETT	Dad!

SEAN	Hey, Red.

CAL	(to Scarlett) You shouldn't be here.

SCARLETT	(to Sean) Let him go.

SEAN	Where is it?

SCARLETT	There. Inside the knife's handle.

SEAN	Good. (beat) Have you figured out who those men were at the cabin? Don't tell me you haven't thought about it yet. They weren't mine.

SCARLETT	What? Who . . .

SEAN	I'm thinking they were your dad's colleagues, maybe a handler—

CAL	Don't listen to him.

SCARLETT	(to Sean) But you—

SEAN	Took care of you? We had some tender moments. I can't help that you're gullible.

CAL	Leave her alone.

SCARLETT	You have it now, so I'm taking my dad and going.

SEAN	I know you're not stupid enough to believe that.

CAL	Don't—

SEAN	Don't what? You have no leverage. What was that?! Go! (at Scarlett) That was you. Cute.

CAL	You can let her go—

SEAN	Shut up. Tie them up in the other room. He 

CAL	You shouldn't have come.

SCARLETT	Where else was I supposed to go? How long was I supposed to hide while you're missing?

CAL	I'm sorry.


SCARLETT	You're hurt--

CAL	Forget about that. The virus--we can't let him have it.

SCARLETT	I know that.

CAL	Whoever he sells it to will use it. 

SCARLETT	It's not the Cetus virus. 

CAL	Whatever it is, I can't let him—

SCARLETT	It's not a virus at all.

CAL	Not bad.

SCARLETT	He'll figure it out. 

CAL	We better be ready. Where is the real stuff?

SCARLETT	Safe, for now.

CAL	What are you doing?

SCARLETT	You had one in a book at the cabin. That's what gave me the idea.

CAL	Help me out then.

SEAN	Hurry. Up. Yes. (beat) I have it. I'm still waiting on the first half of your transfer. (beat) I'll meet you as soon as I receive confirmation. (beat) Fine.

SCARLETT	Dad, those men who died at the cabin, what Sean said about them—

CAL	Don't listen to him. 

SCARLETT	But he wasn't lying, was he? You knew them. (beat) And I killed them. 

CAL	You didn't know what was really going on.

SCARLETT	I'm sorry.

CAL	It's not your fault. 

SCARLETT	Who were they? 

CAL	Don't. I'm the one responsible here. Okay?

SCARLETT	Stop trying to make me feel better. 

CAL	I'm not. This job... it's screwed up your life enough as it is.

SCARLETT	I shouldn't have said that—

CAL	Why not? (beat) It's true. I used to think I'd done enough to protect us. I should never have let it risk you I need an extraction. No, my daughter.  Everything, just get someone to her, pull her from school. (beat) I don't know. Get it done until we confirm.
 
SCARLETT	(cheerful voicemail message) Hey, it's Scarlett. I'm studying like crazy, as usual, so call me back later.

CAL	Scar, call me back. Please, it's an emergency. Really. Call me.

SEAN	What?

LAB TECH	It's not biological. What is it? I think I'm looking at sugar water.

OLOSKI	Get them. Move.

SCARLETT	No!

SEAN	The real vial has to be here. Where? 

SCARLETT	You have it! Just leave me and my dad alone.

SEAN	You keep bargaining for him. Two days ago, you would have wanted me  to pull the trigger and get him out of your life once and for all.

SCARLETT	That's not true. 

SEAN	So you've made your peace with him, huh? Good. Stop playing games. There's nowhere safe to stash it. You would have kept it close, just in case. You've got five seconds to tell me where the real vial is, Red.

CAL	(to Scarlett) Don't.

SEAN	One.

SCARLETT	Don't do this—

SEAN	Two.

CAL	The moment you tell him we're both dead anyway.

SEAN	Three.

SCARLETT	Sean, please—

SEAN	Four—

SCARLETT	Stop! It's outside. In the car! I hid it inside the car. Sean 

SEAN	Show me. (to Garza) Watch him. Where?

SCARLETT	It's in the back. The trunk.

SEAN	Do you want me to bring Cal out here and kill him slowly in front of you? Where is it!

SCARLETT	It's with the spare tire!

GARZA	Don't move. He kill her yet?	

SEAN	Get it, now!

SCARLETT	Okay, okay. Easy. Here. Take it.

SEAN	Watch her. Bye, Red.

CAL	You okay?

SCARLETT	You?

CAL	Where's Sean?

SCARLETT	There.

SEAN	The virus?

SCARLETT	He has it.

CAL	Okay. You stay here. All right?

SCARLETT	(whispered) No. Sean	Go, go!

CAL	Scarlett! Sean!!

SCARLETT	Dad!

CAL	Let her go!

SEAN	Drop the gun!

CAL	It's over!

SEAN	It'd take nothing to snap her neck. Drop it. Good. Kick it to me. 

CAL	Scarlett...

SCARLETT	The vial. This won't look good with the assault charges from earlier this week.

CAL	Don't worry.

SCARLETT	You can't bail me out if they arrest you too.

UNKNOWN MAN	Excuse me. We'll escort them to the hospital.

SCARLETT	You
	
CAL	(to Unknown Man) Good to see you.

SCARLETT	(under her breath) Alive. (to Cal) Your...associates? 

UNKNOWN MAN	Next time, careful what you shoot at.

CAL	Here you go.

SCARLETT	Thanks.

CAL	This looks good.

SCARLETT	How's your leg? 

CAL	Fine. The stitches itch. 

SCARLETT	Don't scratch at it. It'll make it worse. Keep it covered.

CAL	Yes, Nurse Scarlett. The realtor called. She had some decent options this time.

SCARLETT	Remote enough for "Grandma's" new house?

CAL	Off the beaten path, but not too far from the city.

SCARLETT	You could keep the old one. 

CAL	Too risky.  (beat) Want to come see these new ones? 

SCARLETT	I have an exam tomorrow.

CAL	Yeah, of course.

SCARLETT	Can we go this weekend instead?

CAL	Yeah. I'll set it up.  Want to go shooting this weekend too?

SCARLETT	Don't push it. 


(The End.)
