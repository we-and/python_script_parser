NAOMI	Matt? Wake up. 

NAOMI	My door, it won’t open. 

NAOMI	Matt, wake up.

MATT	What? What are you doing?

NAOMI	My door won’t open. 

NAOMI	Try to get your door open. 

MATT	Okay, okay. 

NAOMI	What the…?

MATT	Okay, hold on. 

NAOMI	What are you doing?

MATT	I’mma get it goin’. 

NAOMI	I think we’re snowed under.

MATT	Just some ice. 

NAOMI	If it were just ice, there would be some visibility. Wouldn’t there be?

MATT	Well, at least we’ll get the engine going and it’ll help warm us up and… 

MATT	and loosen the snow.

NAOMI	You’re gonna flood it!

MATT	There’s nothing to flood. 

NAOMI	Oh, shit. 

NAOMI	Shit. Shit.

MATT	Okay. Don’t worry. Don’t worry.

MATT	Breathe. 

MATT	It’s okay. 

MATT	Goes out through the back.

NAOMI	Matt.

MATT	Shit. 

NAOMI	Matt.

MATT	Just don’t worry.

MATT	Ah, shit.

NAOMI	Matt?

MATT	Can you just give me one second, please? 

MATT	I’m sorry, baby. I’m just trying to get my head around this, okay?

NAOMI	I knew we should have kept on driving. I knew it. I said it.

MATT	Okay, can we calm down, please?

NAOMI	We should have kept on driving at least another hour or two…

NAOMI	to get to a village or something.

MATT	It was freezing rain in the middle of the night. Should we have kept going? 

NAOMI	We’re so fucked.

MATT	Can you not be so defeatist? 

NAOMI	Come on. 

NAOMI	Shit. 

NAOMI	The battery’s at half-life.

MATT	Let me see.

NAOMI	Wait.

MATT	Come on, come on… 

NAOMI	Matt, give me the phone. 

MATT	Hold on one minute.

NAOMI	Matt, just give me the phone. 

NAOMI	Matt! 

NAOMI	We need to save the battery.

MATT	Can we please not argue? Okay? I’m sorry. 

MATT	I just need a few minutes, and I’ll get us out of this. Okay?

NAOMI	Okay.

MATT	Let’s see where we are.

NAOMI	What food do we have?

MATT	Chicken, cheese, and a herring sandwich.

MATT	Here we go, here we go. 

MATT	Okay. 

MATT	All right.

MATT	All right, we’re on this road. We’re somewhere between here and here. 

MATT	Okay, someone is going to pass by. 

MATT	Can you please not panic?

NAOMI	Okay. Let me know when I should start. 

MATT	What? What’s wrong?

NAOMI	Shit. My back.

MATT	Shit. 

MATT	Well, you know what? Come back here. 

MATT	There’s more space. 

MATT	Come on. Come on.

MATT	Okay. Okay. Okay. 

MATT	Okay. 

MATT	You want your legs up here?

NAOMI	Yeah.

MATT	How’s she doing?

NAOMI	She’s fine. 

NAOMI	She keeps on kicking. She’s okay. 

NAOMI	What about you?

MATT	Fine. This is…

MATT	This is absurd.

NAOMI	Yeah.

NAOMI	What are you doing?

MATT	The rental guy said there was a roadside kit. 

MATT	Okay. Want to get…

NAOMI	Oh, yeah.

MATT	One, two, three, four. 

MATT	Here we go. 

MATT	Here we go. This. 

NAOMI	Yay.

MATT	And we have light.

NAOMI	Yes. 

NAOMI	Now we can clearly see the shitstorm we’re in.

MATT	No, this is good. It means we have air. 

MATT	I’m kidding. 

MATT	How is that?

NAOMI	It’s really good.

MATT	Yeah?

NAOMI	Yeah. Want some? 

NAOMI	Shit. 

NAOMI	Matt? 

NAOMI	I have to pee. 

MATT	Okay. 

MATT	Okay. 

MATT	Okay... 

MATT	There, shit. 

NAOMI	What are you doing?

MATT	I’ve got something. 

MATT	Here. Here. 

MATT	Just ball this up and go on it.

NAOMI	You’re kidding.

MATT	It’s what my mother did when she was bedridden. 

MATT	I’d have to keep changing the towels.

NAOMI	That’s disgusting.

MATT	Okay? 

MATT	Sorry. 

NAOMI	I just peed on a towel.

NAOMI	12 days. 

NAOMI	And only two bottles of water. 

NAOMI	That’s what we have to survive on.

MATT	What about these chocolates?

NAOMI	No, we’re not eating those. That’s the only thing my sister’s asked for.

NAOMI	So any ideas how we’re getting out of here with this stuff?

MATT	I don’t think we should get out of here.

NAOMI	Matt. 

NAOMI	We have to try and get out of here. We can’t just stay here. 

NAOMI	I think we should break the window and use it to dig.

MATT	I think that’s a really bad idea.

NAOMI	Why?

MATT	Because we don’t know what’s out there. 

MATT	Look, I’m not some kind of an expert or anything…

MATT	but I think we should stay right here.

NAOMI	That’s not really much of a plan.

MATT	Okay, then try your phone again. 

NAOMI	I did. 

NAOMI	Twice. 

NAOMI	We’re gonna freeze in here.

MATT	And you don’t think we’re gonna freeze out there? 

MATT	Come on, at least we’re enclosed. 

MATT	We’ve got candlelight, we have blankets for warmth, we have body heat.

NAOMI	And what if no one is out there looking for us? 

NAOMI	What if it hasn’t even stopped snowing yet?

MATT	If we don’t show to your book signing

NAOMI	I can’t believe you.

MATT	What? What is so wrong with that? 

NAOMI	What’s wrong with this is that -

MATT	If the weather’s as bad as you say it is…

MATT	then who’s gonna show up to your book signing anyway?

NAOMI	This is insane.

MATT	No! What’s insane is…

MATT	is traipsing around the frozen wilderness. 

MATT	With a pregnant lady following the North Star. 

MATT	Hoping we’re gonna find a Fairfield Inn or something. 

MATT	I just need you to trust me. Okay?

NAOMI	Okay. 

NAOMI	Okay, Matt. 

NAOMI	We’re gonna need more layers.

MATT	Okay. 

MATT	Morning.

NAOMI	Good morning. 

NAOMI	Did you eat?

MATT	 I’m not even hungry.

MATT	Oh, shit! Shit.

NAOMI	What? What is it?

MATT	Fuck!

NAOMI	Calm down.

MATT	You have to put the cap back on.

NAOMI	I’m sorry. It was an accident.

MATT	You are just…

NAOMI	I just what? I just what, Matt? 

MATT	Nothing. 

MATT	Nothing.

NAOMI	Great. 

NAOMI	Great. 

NAOMI	Good morning to you.

MATT	Sorry, we just need to be more careful.

MATT	Listen.

NAOMI	What?

MATT	Hello?

MATT	Hey! 

MATT	Hey!

MATT AND NAOMI	Hello?! Hello?!

MATT	Hey! We’re in here! Hey!

NAOMI	Hey, we’re down here! We’re in here!

MATT	Hey! 

NAOMI	Hey!

MATT	We’re in here! 

MATT	Hello?

MATT	Hello? 

MATT	Hello? 

MATT	Hello? 

MATT	Hello? 

MATT	Hello? 

MATT	Are you okay? 

MATT	Hey? 

MATT	Are you okay? 

MATT	Come here.

NAOMI	The horn died. 

MATT	Hey, shh. It’s okay. 

MATT	Hey, it’s gonna be okay. It’s going to be okay. Okay?

MATT	Okay. 

NORMAN	Hello?

NAOMI	Daddy. 

NAOMI	Daddy!

NORMAN	Naomi? Where are you?

NAOMI	Daddy, it’s Naomi. 

NORMAN	Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

NAOMI	We’re stuck… 

MATT	Is your dad on the phone?

NAOMI	We’re in Norway.

MATT	Norman? 

NAOMI	We’re stuck in the snow. 

NAOMI	I don’t really know where we are, Dad.

MATT	Norman? Norman, we’re buried on the side of a road. 

NAOMI	Daddy, can you hear me?

MATT	We’re 50 miles east of our hotel.

NAOMI	Can you hear me?

MATT	Give me the phone.

NAOMI	Dad?

MATT	Give me the…

NAOMI	Dad? 

MATT	It’s dead. 

MATT	Why didn’t you wake me up? 

MATT	This was our one chance. 

MATT	Do you know that?

NAOMI	It’s getting colder in here.

MATT	I know.

NAOMI	I came all this way for my stupid book signing.

MATT	Well…

MATT	don’t think like that. 

MATT	Keep your strength up.

NAOMI	You have to eat, too.

MATT	I’m fine. 

NAOMI	What’s gonna happen when the food runs out?

MATT	I’m getting close on this window. 

MATT	If I can crack it just a few inches…

MATT	we could scrape it. We’ll eat the snow.

NAOMI	And eat our way out? 

NAOMI	Matthew! 

NAOMI	We have to break a window. We have to start digging.

MATT	Do you know what’s out there? 

MATT	Do you know? 

MATT	Once it’s broken, it’s broken. 

MATT	Then what? 

MATT	Do you remember that story…

MATT	about that guy from Africa whose boat capsized? 

MATT	He survived for weeks in an air pocket. 

MATT	No food. Nothing. He stayed put.

NAOMI	You fucking baffle me. 

NAOMI	“It’ll be fine, sweetheart. We’ll just pull right over here.” 

NAOMI	“We’ll drive to the hotel in the morning.” 

MATT	We both agreed that it was not a good idea…

MATT	to drive aimlessly through the night.

NAOMI	But it was a good idea to fall asleep during a blizzard!

MATT	Did you know we were gonna wake up in the middle of the next fucking Ice Age? 

MATT	What is your problem? 

MATT	What are you doing? 

MATT	What? 

MATT	Breathe. What’s wrong? 

MATT	What’s happening? 

MATT	Is it the baby? 

MATT	Naom? Naom?

NAOMI	Pills in my bag.

MATT	We’re supposed to be partners.

NAOMI	Just leave it.

MATT	Were you ever gonna tell me?

NAOMI	It’s not your problem. 

NAOMI	We can’t be up each other’s asses all the time.

MATT	That’s being up each other’s asses?

NAOMI	Yes. 

NAOMI	People have secrets.

MATT	What the fuck does that mean? 

MATT	Tell me.

MATT	What secrets?

NAOMI	Just… 

NAOMI	drop it. 

NAOMI	Please. 

NAOMI	I think we should write a letter. 

NAOMI	For when we’re discovered.

MATT	No.

NAOMI	I think we should consider the possibility.

MATT	I don’t want to hear that. 

MATT	Is that what you’ve been so busy writing?

NAOMI	It’s not your business.

MATT	It is my business. 

MATT	You don’t get to make those decisions for both of us. 

MATT	What did you write? 

MATT	What did you write?

NAOMI	I wrote a stupid story, okay?

MATT	About?

NAOMI	A woman in Paris.

MATT	Paris?

NAOMI	It’s a bit more glamorous than a giant heap of snow in Norway.

MATT	And?

NAOMI	And she’s a helpless old lady who lives alone…

NAOMI	gets stuck in her bathroom. 

NAOMI	Okay?

MATT	Go on. 

NAOMI	She starts banging on the walls…

NAOMI	and clanking on the pipes. 

NAOMI	And she even opens her window and starts yelling…

NAOMI	and nothing. 

NAOMI	But the neighbors, they complain about the noise…

NAOMI	and nothing happens. 

NAOMI	Until finally…

NAOMI	when the landlord needs to collect his rent…

NAOMI	so he breaks down her door and finds her.

MATT	Is she alive?

NAOMI	She was barely alive.

MATT	Thank you.

NAOMI	But he evicted her.

MATT	It’s funny, though who gets stuck in a bathroom?

NAOMI	Probably the same idiots who fall asleep during a blizzard. 

NAOMI	Hey! Help!

NAOMI	Help! Help!

MATT	Hey! Hey! 

NAOMI	Help!

MATT	Fuck!

NAOMI	Hey!

NAOMI	Help!

NAOMI	Matt. 

NAOMI	Matt. Stop.

MATT	Fuck! 

MATT	Fuck, fuck, fuck!

NAOMI	It’s okay. 

MATT	No.

NAOMI	Listen, you were right. You were right. 

NAOMI	Vehicles pass by here. Someone else is gonna come.

MATT	No one’s coming. No one else will come. 

MATT	I can’t catch a fucking break.

NAOMI	What are you saying right now?

MATT	I got fired.

NAOMI	You said you had vacation time.

MATT	No. No, what else can I say? I suck. 

MATT	I was ashamed, okay? Fucking ashamed. Is that what you need to hear? 

MATT	What did you want me to say? 

MATT	“Hey, hey, look, I know the book isn’t off to a great start and I lost my job…”

MATT	“but great news! We’re gonna have a baby.”

NAOMI	Don’t turn this around on me. 

NAOMI	No. 

NAOMI	You’re doing this because you lied. 

NAOMI	This isn’t about me or the baby.

MATT	No, no, no. You never wanted this baby. That’s why you’re still taking your pills.

NAOMI	Don’t you dare! Don’t you fucking dare! 

NAOMI	Don’t try to tell me how I feel about having my child!

MATT	Then why? Why are you still taking your pills?

NAOMI	I brought the pills in case of an emergency…

NAOMI	which this fucking is! 

NAOMI	I’m trying to do things the right way! 

NAOMI	I’m trying to do everything the right way! What the fuck?!

MATT	Except drugging our unborn child, that’s okay, right? That doesn’t cross the-

MATT	Hey, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. 

MATT	Is this what you want, huh? Do you want me to lash into you? Is it?

NAOMI	Get the fuck off me. 

NAOMI	Get off me.

MATT	What?

NAOMI	Nothing.

MATT	Naomi! 

MATT	What the hell is wrong with you?! 

MATT	Naomi, stop!

NAOMI	Leave me alone!

MATT	We’re gonna freeze in here, what the hell is wrong with you?

NAOMI	Stay the fuck away from me! 

MATT	Goddamn it! 

MATT	What are you doing?

NAOMI	I’m burning up!

MATT	What are you doing? Stop! 

NAOMI	Don’t hurt me! What did you do to me?

MATT	Stop it! 

MATT	No! No! 

MATT	Stop it, stop it! Stop it!

NAOMI	Get off of me! Get off! Get off of me! Get off! 

MATT	It’s me, it’s me. I’m right here.

NAOMI	Let me out! Let me out!

MATT	I’m trying to help you! 

MATT	You can’t give up! Okay? I’m not trying to hurt you. 

MATT	Please, I don’t want you to hurt yourself. What? 

MATT	What is it? What is it? Is it the baby? 

MATT	Naomi. 

MATT	What is it? 

MATT	Baby, talk to me. 

MATT	Is this the first time you felt this? 

MATT	Why didn’t you tell me anything?

NAOMI	I don’t know! I don’t know! 

NAOMI	I can’t feel anything anymore. 

MATT	Okay, okay. 

MATT	I think you’re hypothermic, okay? We need to warm you up. 

MATT	We need to warm you up, okay? 

MATT	Here.

MATT	Here you go, here you go. 

MATT	Come on. 

MATT	There you go. Okay, okay. 

MATT	Baby, here, here. Here. 

MATT	There you go. There you go. 

MATT	Come on. 

MATT	There you go. Okay. Come on, we gotta get your energy up. 

MATT	Come on, eat. Eat. Come on. 

MATT	Okay. 

MATT	Here. 

MATT	Here. Okay? 

MATT	Okay?

NAOMI	It’s happening. It’s happening today. 

MATT	I think this is it. 

NAOMI	No! 

NAOMI	No, no, I can’t, I can’t do this. Stop. I can’t.

MATT	I don’t think we have much of a choice, baby.

NAOMI	I can’t do it. I can’t. 

MATT	Breathe. That’s it, breathe. 

NAOMI	Oh, Matt, it’s coming. 

MATT	Okay. 

MATT	Come on, baby, push. Push. Come on, one more push! 

MATT	One more push. Come on, baby! Come on! Come on! 

NAOMI	I love you, baby. 

NAOMI	She’s so beautiful. 

NAOMI	She’s perfect. 

MATT	What is it? 

NAOMI	I can’t… 

NAOMI	Please. 

MATT	You gotta push, baby.

MATT	Okay. Come on. 

NAOMI	Pancakes. 

NAOMI	Buttermilk pancakes. 

NAOMI	With salted butter. 

NAOMI	And maple syrup. 

NAOMI	And crispy bacon. 

MATT	Okay.

NAOMI	Oh, like a...

NAOMI	applewood smoked…

NAOMI	bacon that you just...

NAOMI	scoop up some maple syrup.

MATT	Waffles. 

MATT	Belgian waffles. 

MATT	So crispy and golden with…

MATT	ever-so-slightly runny eggs.

NAOMI	Oh, I hate runny eggs. 

MATT	I love you so much.

NAOMI	I love you. 

NAOMI	Babe?

NAOMI	We haven’t named her yet.

MATT	No, we haven’t.

NAOMI	What do you wanna name her?

MATT	You make the call. 

NAOMI	How about Olivia?

MATT	Like your sister?

NAOMI	No. 

NAOMI	Like “live”.

MATT	It’s perfect.

NAOMI	Hi, Liv.

NAOMI	It’s okay. It’s okay. 

NAOMI	It’s okay. 

MATT	She okay?

NAOMI	Mm-hmm.

NAOMI	Here you go. 

NAOMI	It’s okay, my love, it’s okay. 

NAOMI	Here you go, Mommy’s here. Mommy’s here.

NAOMI	I have you. I got you, my love. 

NAOMI	You’re okay. You’re okay, baby.

MATT	Give her this. 

MATT	I’m working up some good heat. 

MATT	Don’t worry about me.

NAOMI	It’s okay.

NAOMI	It’s okay.

NAOMI	Good morning. 

NAOMI	Ah, I’m so tired. 

NAOMI	Could I have some more water? 

NAOMI	Matt? 

NAOMI	Babe? 

NAOMI	Oh, no. No, no. 

NAOMI	Hold on a second! 

NAOMI	Baby, breathe! It’s okay, babe. It’s okay. 

NAOMI	Come on. It’s okay! It’s okay, baby! It’s okay! 

NAOMI	It’s okay, babe. Hey. 

NAOMI	Hey! 

NAOMI	Hey, wait. Wait! 

NAOMI	Matt! 

NAOMI	Matt! Hold on! Hold on. 

NAOMI	Hold on. 

NAOMI	Hold on. 

NAOMI	This is not part of the plan. 

NAOMI	This… 

NAOMI	We… 

NAOMI	I love you. 

NAOMI	No, Matt.

NAOMI	No, no, it’s okay. 

NAOMI	It’s okay. 

NAOMI	It’s okay. 

NAOMI	I’m sorry…

NAOMI	Don’t. It’s just a letter.

NAOMI	Help! Help! 

NAOMI	Help me! 

NAOMI	Help! 

NAOMI	Come on. 

NAOMI	Come on, baby, please. Please. 

NAOMI	Come on, baby, please. Please. 

NAOMI	I know. 

NAOMI	I know. 

NAOMI	I know, sweetheart. 

NAOMI	It’s okay. 

NAOMI	It’s okay. 

NAOMI	Come on, baby. You have to eat. Please eat. 

NAOMI	Please. 

NAOMI	Oh, thank god. 

NAOMI	Okay. 

NAOMI	No, of course. 

NAOMI	She’s great. 

NAOMI	She’s warm now, thanks to you. 

NAOMI	What? 

NAOMI	We’re just tough. 

NAOMI	You were never really looking for your car. 

NAOMI	The cabbie was so pissed. 

NAOMI	I know. 

NAOMI	I miss you. 

NAOMI	Liv! 

NAOMI	Liv! We’re getting out, Liv! We’re getting out! 

NAOMI	We’re going home, Liv.

NAOMI	It’s okay. 

NAOMI	It’s okay. 

NAOMI	It’s okay. It’s all right.

NAOMI	Because we’re getting out. 

NAOMI	We’re getting out, my love. 

NAOMI	Thank you. Thank you. 

NAOMI	Good-bye, Matt.

NAOMI	Stay with me. 

NAOMI	Come on, stay with me.
