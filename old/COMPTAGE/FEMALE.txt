MICAH	Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the final round of the biannual Free Fighting Championship.

MICAH	Tonight we have a very special event.

MICAH	On one side we have Claire "The Bull" Stronsom.

MICAH	On the other, you've heard her name echo through these halls... a myth, an urban legend right here before your very own eyes: Bex "The Beast Holt
MICAH	No weapons. No dying.

GABY	Come on knock her out.

POLICE OFFICER	Hands. Show me your hands. Now! Hands up.

BECCA	Hey Buster. Behave.

BECCA	Hey Quincy! Awe, this could be your lucky day today buddy. What do you say huh?

BECCA	I know, I know. Hey, do you wanna know a little secret? You're my favorite dog.

PAULA	This is one of our favorites

CLIENT	Three legs how did that happen?

MALE SHELTER WORKER	Yeah, he was in an accident with his owner.

CLIENT	What?

CLIENT	Who's this little guy over here?

PAULA	This guy is actually...

PAULA	Becca could you lock up for today? There's one more client with Randy and that should be it for the day.

BECCA	Yeah. Sure thing.

PAULA	Still daydreaming about that place?

BECCA	Sorry I was...

PAULA	Don't be. It's good the dream big. Do good work around here and we'll help you in any way we can.

BECCA	Thanks.

PAULA	Sorry guys we're closed for the day.

BURLY 1	No worries, please, we lost our dog and we just came by to see if it turned up. Please I beg you. It'll take you two seconds. Two seconds two seconds.

PAULA	Well let me check in the system.

PAULA	What breed is it?

BURLY 1	It's a brown and white pit bull.

PAULA	Nope. We don't have anything in the system guys.
BURLY 1	Look again.

PAULA	I already looked. We don't have it. We don't have the dog.

BURLY 1	Take your little fingers and look again.

PAULA	I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

BURLY 1	I'm gonna tell you one more fucking time. Look for my fucking dog.

PAULA	I need you to leave right now

BURLY 1	Get me my dog. Get me my dog. Or I'll kill every fucking dog in here.

BURLY 1	Bring it.

BURLY 2	I got it.

PAULA	I'm calling the cops!

BECCA	Wait. You're not even going the right way. Just wait.

BURLY 1	Get the fuck off. What's wrong with you? You a fucking stupid ass?

BECCA	Hey asshole.

KATE	Damn... you look good.

BECCA	How'd you find me?

KATE	Five million hits in less than a week? That's pretty good.

KATE	What? Do you not want to be found

BECCA	Are you okay?

KATE	Naw... that is the last thing I am right now.

BECCA	What happened?

KATE	I owe money to some very bad people.

BECCA	Of course you do. And?

KATE	I'm not lying they'll fucking kill..

BECCA	They'll fucking kill me if I don't give them the money.

KATE	I'm serious Becca.

BECCA	Really? How much?

KATE	100K

BECCA	Even if I had that kind of cash I wouldn't

KATE	But you could have it.

BECCA	I'm not gonna fight

KATE	I'm not asking you to. Just help me win. I've got a group of girls and...

BECCA	No.

KATE	The pot's $150k, the girls and I agreed: a 100 for the debt, 25 for you and we'll just split the rest.

BECCA	Well I don't want your money Kate.

KATE	What do you want then?

BECCA	Get the fuck out.

KATE	I knew this was a waste of time.

SAM	Yeah she called in a couple of days ago.

SAM	She got me worried

BECCA	Yeah, big surprise there

SAM	Make your own decision just don't forget about the consequences.

BECCA	I don't want to do it. I didn't wanna do it then. I don't wanna do it now. I don't want to do it.

SAM	Yeah and I didn't want to do it either. But look, here we are.

BECCA	Do you expect us to be the fucking Brady Bunch when you get out? Hold hands by the campfire. Sing kumbaya.

SAM	No. I expect to see my daughters still alive. But if you don't help your sister I might not get to.

BECCA	I'll sleep on it.

SAM	Alright sleep on it. I love you.

BECCA	I love you too.

BECCA	That's one way?

BECCA	No, no return. You know what, I'm gonna have to call back. Thank you though.

BECCA	That's all.

BECCA	You too.

ZEKE	Jib jab right hand. Jib jab right hand. No slouching. Don't slouch. That's it. Jib jab right hand. Good again. Jib jab right hand. Good.

ZEKE	Okay, okay okay... take five.

KID	I gotcha.

ZEKE	Yeah. Whatever. Don't tell me.. It's that feeling you get when you're in here... there's nothing quite like it. Right?

BECCA	Yeah, yeah... How you doin'?

ZEKE	I've seen better days but as long as the engine keeps running... Where have you been all these years?

BECCA	L.A.

ZEKE	A L.A. chasing the dreams?

BECCA	Just trying to wash away all the filth.

ZEKE	Then why come back to the mud?

BECCA	I'm gonna train Kate.

ZEKE	They're gonna drag you back to that snake pit. You girls go there... sooner or later you're gonna get bit. Does your father know about this?

BECCA	Kate didn't leave us much of a choice.

ZEKE	Hey don't You know what. Don't say that. There's always a choice.

BECCA	Where is she?

ZEKE	You really wanna know?

KATE	Better the devil you know I guess..

BECCA	You're still doing it wrong you know?

BECCA	I'm not gonna ask you why you're here. And you're not going to ask me to fight. I'm going to have to undo all your bad habits and build you from the ground up.

KATE	Guess we'll give it a whirl then huh? I've got other girls, too.

BECCA	That's fine.

KATE	You're not fucking with me are you?

BECCA	There's still payment involved?

KATE	Yes.

BECCA	Then no I'm not fucking with you. You get out tomorrow right?

KATE	Wait, you're not gonna bail me out of here?

BECCA	I'll see you at three.

KATE	Are you serious?

KATE	Becca. Oh come on.

POTTER	Becca?

BECCA	You're a cop?

POTTER	What the fuck? Where have you've been all this time?

BECCA	I can take you for a coffee and explain?

POTTER	I already had a cup of coffee today.

BECCA	Okay... um.. a beer?

POTTER	Look, you can tell me whatever you gotta say to me right here. Right now. You know that's fine, I don't really care.
BECCA	Just wait I can explain.

POTTER	Wait? It's been five years Becca! Five years. I've stopped waiting for you a long time ago.

BECCA	Look... I'm sorry. You have no idea what I went through.

POTTER	Don't you think it's a little bit late for that.

POTTER	Excuse me I've got work to do.

KATE	You ready?

BECCA	You're late.

KATE	Yeah well I had an emergency at home.

BECCA	Yeah yeah dog ate your homework...

KATE	So it's changed a bit.

KATE	This place runs as an import/export company for the most part. But the real money is in the fights.	

NIKA	Holt. What is this?

KATE	Just bringing by some new customers. Back off.

NIKA	Does Landon know about it?

KATE	She's got money. Isn't that what matters?

BECCA	Girlfriend of yours?

KATE	She's just a guard dog. All bark and no bite.

BECCA	Seems like a lot of trouble to be betting on illegal fights with Sin City at your door.

KATE	We get a lot of low level junkies that can't fight on the big shows.

BECCA	Sounds like a shitty profit margin. Anything higher stakes?

KATE	Well we get a couple of high rollers in here.

BECCA	Why would they come here?

KATE	They burned too many bridges. This place is a mess for all kinds of illegal activity. Dog fights. Cock fights. But most people come here to watch two women beat the shit out of each other.

BECCA	Lovely.

KATE	Hey Sal... get the door?

MICAH	Bull wins again ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your bets. Collect your winnings at the register on your way out and may we see you and your green paper again soon.

MICAH	Hey you don't fight today do you? I didn't see you in the entries.

KATE	No. Just being a tour guide.

MICAH	Oh! Welcome then. How may I be of service.

KATE	Slow down governor. She's off limits.

MICAH	Yeah... I've heard that before. My name's Micah.

BECCA	Becca

MICAH	You have beautiful eyes. Have you seen them lately? They're great. Anyway, I should get back to work. Before I'm redundant. Cheers.

BECCA	Friend?

KATE	Yeah. He's a good guy. He makes sure we don't break any rules.

BECCA	Which are?

KATE	No weapons, no dying.

BECCA	You mean killing.

KATE	No, Jones makes it clear from the get go that if you die, its on you.

BECCA	Jones?

KATE	Yeah. It's his joint. He used to be a fight promoter till he got banned by the Commission for illegal betting.

KATE	He runs a lot of stuff out of here, but he started Pit Nights to give fighters a home, a chance to earn some extra cash.

BECCA	Yeah, I'm sure he's quite the philanthropist. He's the guy you owe money to. What about cops?

KATE	That's the chief of police right there. Welcome home Becca.

KATE	Hey.

WINTER	Katy babe! You're out! And you brought mama a fresh piece of meat from the slammer.

KATE	Becca meet Winter.

BECCA	Why Winter?

WINTER	Because I knock bitches out cold!

BECCA	Cute.

KATE	This is Lisa Ming. She's our sexy Vietnamese spring roll. She's got a mean ass kick too. And this over here is Gaby. Little feisty Gaby.

KATE	What do you think?

BECCA	Can they fight?

GABY	Let's go Barbie. You're so pretty right? You ready?

GABY	Let's go.

WINTER	Too many quesadillas puta!

GABY	Why don't you come in here and see what you can do?

WINTER	Shit I thought you'd never ask.

WINTER	Fuck you.

KATE	Alright Lisa, you got this.

WINTER	Come on you got this.

GABY	Let's go.

WINTER	Come on come on.

GABY	Check it off.

KATE	Get out of there.

BECCA	You're flatfooted. You'll never generate enough power like that. Your technique is sloppy. And she sacrifices power for speed.

WINTER	Kate, put a muzzle on this bitch before I break her face.

BECCA	You are aware you have to make contact to do that right?

WINTER	You gonna tell us who your mystery girl is? Huh?

KATE	She's your new trainer.

GABY	She's Bex Holt.

LISA	You're Bex.

WINTER	Who the fuck is "Bex"?

LISA	You use to fight at the brewery back in the day. You're Bex the Beast.

GABY	But she isn't... she's the dog whisperer now. Huh? Right?

BECCA	I'll see you guys tomorrow.

KATE	So you wanna come over for dinner tonight?

BECCA	Naw I got other plans.

KATE	Really?

ZEKE	Becca? What the hell are you doing?

BECCA	leeping?

ZEKE	That's real smart in an open car like this. Grab your bag I'm gonna drive you to the gym.

BECCA	Okay, just stop pointing that flashlight in my face.

ZEKE	Let me get that for ya.

BECCA	Thanks. How long you been doing the security gig for?

ZEKE	Since your dad went to prison. You know this place is a money pit. I have to do the tax thing just to keep it going. Sam better make good on getting out, becuz I can't swing this racket much longer. Anyway, the room's a little small. I use it sometimes when I'm too beat up to go home but.

BECCA	I'm sure it'll be fine.

BECCA	It's great. What happened there?

ZEKE	Oh that. I used to have a fighter fish in there until my ex-wife took one of my trophies and threw it at it. Well she actually threw at me but I ducked and that's what happened.

BECCA	She sounds lovely.

ZEKE	Yeah she was lovely. In fact I didn't realize what a good housekeeper she was. We got divorced. She kept the house. Look I gotta tell you something. I gotta get it off my chest. I still can't believe your dad killed those kids, even after what they did to Kate.

BECCA	Why not?

ZEKE	Your dad and I have known each other since we were seven years old. We used to chase girls together, we drank our first beer together, we even built this place together. And I've seen him go through some tough shit in his life. But he was always a kind person... always.

BECCA	Alright alright alright come on. Circle up. Fighting, in its purest form, is about subduing your opponent without actually fighting.

GABY	First class and you hand us a shitty paradox. What are we supposed to do with that?

BECCA	It's an impossibility in most cases, but the closer you are to that form, the easier it is to defeat your opponent.

BECCA	What's the most important quality a fighter should have?

ALL	Strength

LISA	Come on no.

KATE	Brains.

BECCA	Yes.

WINTER	Teacher's pet.

BECCA	You can be strong, you can be fast but if you're not smart about how you fight, then none of it matters.

LISA	Excuse me. Teacher. Question. Are we gonna get going or is this a theory class?

BECCA	Okay spring roll.

WINTER	Alright.

BECCA	Think about it. I already know you're coming fast.

BECCA	You already know I'm faster than you... so what do you do? You already know I'm faster than you... so what do you do? Plant your feet. Speed is not your friend here.

GABY	You gotta stop eating that orange chicken.

BECCA	You went for the face and sacrificed your footing. Again.

LISA	Alright Morpheus.

BECCA	Last try.

WINTER	In yo face.

BECCA	Good. Next.

POTTER	I was a bit harsh the other night.

BECCA	What?

POTTER	I was a bit harsh the other night.

BECCA	An apology?

POTTER	No. I think I'm entitled to my reaction. I'm just reconsidering your request.

BECCA	I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for not calling, I'm sorry for not coming back. What do you want me to say? I'm sorry. After what happened to Kate, and Dad I... I didn't know up from down.

POTTER	Why did you come back?

BECCA	I'm helping Kate with some.. personal issues.

BECCA	Where's your uniform.

POTTER	I'm off duty.

BECCA	When did that happen?

POTTER	About two hours ago.

BECCA	No your badge.

POTTER	Three years ago. I got fired from the track. I decided to join the force. Decent pay, benefits.. a future. Where are you staying?

BECCA	At the gym, just up the street.

POTTER	I know where it is.

POTTER	You know I actually I should really get going. Try not to go Houdini on me again.

BECCA	You've got to be smart about how you fight, and how you fight depends on who you fight.

BECCA	What do you see here?

GABY	Existential torment.

ZEKE	Why don't you come and give it a spin, Socrates.

GABY	It's Nietzsche to be precise but you wouldn't know that right?

ZEKE	Why don't you try hitting me you little shit.

GABY	Don't mind if I do.

ZEKE	See if I can even feel it.

BECCA	Ok. Off Zeke's point, just like him, the Bull's thick. But it's all muscle.

WINTER	She's a big bitch for sure.

LISA	You're a big bitch for sure.

WINTER	Yeah but I float like a butterfly.

BECCA	Muscle acts like armor. The more you have, the more protected you are. So there's no point attacking here... here... or there.

ZEKE	Can I hit back?

BECCA	Would love it if you did.

BECCA	So we're gonna learn how to manipulate the joints through technique. An attack where there's no muscle. Right?

BECCA	Come on.

BECCA	Elbows, wrists, knees. It's not about size and strength. It's about technique.

ZEKE	I think we all get the point, Becca. We get the point.

KATE	What about the throat?

BECCA	That's a dangerous spot Kate.

KATE	Yeah, but it will lay anyone out.

BECCA	Or kill them.

KATE	Okay. Just break in case of emergency is that okay?

BECCA	So, who's up first?

ZEKE	Hey hey.. one at a time. One at a time.

KATE	You got any dinner plans?

BECCA	No.

KATE	I was thinking you could maybe come by. See my place.

BECCA	I'm exhausted Kate, maybe another time.

KATE	Come on man! I'm trying here...

BECCA	You're never going to stop asking are you?

KATE	Is that a yes?

BECCA	You own this place?

KATE	I rent.

LILY	Mommy.

KATE	Hey.

SASHA	Hi Kate. Sorry the place is kind of a mess. We were playing indoor tag and that got like completely out of control.

KATE	Thank you so much for getting her. This is my sister Becca.

SASHA	Oh. Hi, I heard so much about you. All good things, of course. You've got a beautiful family.

BECCA	Thanks.

SASHA	Okay well I will let you...

KATE	Oh yeah yeah sorry. I got them.. there we go. You wanna give it to her?

SASHA	Thank you.

SASHA	Bye. Um... it was nice to meet you.

KATE	Lily, I want you to meet someone. This is your Aunt Becca. Don't hide. Hey. What do we say when we meet someone?

LILY	Nice to meet you.

KATE	Right. Can you say it to her please?

LILY	Nice to meet you.

BECCA	Hey Lily. How old are you?

LILY	Five.

KATE	Hey, why don't you go clean your room for Aunt Becca, okay?

LILY	Okay.

KATE	Okay. It's a little messy in here.

BECCA	So this guy you owe money to.. Jones.

KATE	What about him?

BECCA	How well do you know him?

KATE	Well enough. He's a business man. Ruthless. One of those "not to be fucked with" kinda guys.

BECCA	How ruthless? Can you be a bit more specific?

KATE	A couple of months ago these two guys showed up at The Pit. Coming fresh off a hot streak. $50 grand buy in. And they bet it all on this first timer. She didn't stand a chance. She was up against one of the toughest chicks in that entire circle, and yet, she won. $400 grand pay out.
BECCA	Jesus.

KATE	Yeah. The problem came when Jones found out the whole thing was staged.

BECCA	Both fighters were in on it. And a hundred grand each. Why?

KATE	Because I needed the money for medical bills.

BECCA	What's wrong with you? Hmm? What's so wrong with you?

LILY	I'm all done mom.

KATE	Lily-bug, you ready?

LILY	Can Aunt Becca do it?

KATE	Of course sweetie, you can show her how.

LILY	Open it. You just put that in there, and then push that and put it to three and then I'll get all better. Push that thing and put that right there. Then turn it to three.

BECCA	Ready? All better?

LILY	Uh huh.

LILY	Mommy?

BECCA	Let's stay here. Why don't you show me your room huh?

LILY	Come on then!

BECCA	Excuse me.

JONES	Are you planning on building something?

BECCA	I'm thinking about it. A house maybe.

JONES	Hmmm. In France?

BECCA	Oh, no. I want to go to Africa, the part where they speak French.

JONES	Why Africa? (in French)

BECCA	Why not?

JONES	Yes. Why not.

JONES	I guess a little adventure is good when you're young.

BECCA	How about you?

JONES	Um, it's a little hobby of mine. I uh build birdhouses on my spare time.

BECCA	Hmmm. How many have you built?

JONES	Hundreds.

BECCA	Oh. Do you sell them?

JONES	No. No. It's more of a therapeutic type thing that I do. Helps me relax.

BECCA	Have you tried a stress ball?

JONES	No. Stress ball, Zen garden, I've tried it all. But there's nothing like building a house where animals can come take shelter, eat, procreate... you know it just makes things right in my world.

BECCA	Must be a hell of a world

JONES	Hell's got nothing on this, mademoiselle.

BECCA	Well good luck with everything... mister.. ?

JONES	J'amappelle Landon. Et vous?

BECCA	J'amapepelle Rebecca.

JONES	Enchante. You have strong hands. Builders hands.

BECCA	Merci.

JONES	Au revoir.

WINTER	Yo Becca.

BECCA	Hey.

WINTER	So, I've been doing some digging and, a friend of mine told me about her first time at a midnight fight, she said she bet on this huge Goliath looking girl who was fighting a scrawny newbie. So check this, not only does this tiny ass bunny beat the Goliath, but when the house wouldn't pay her, she took out the two bouncers at the joint.

WINTER	Said as she was walking out of the brewery, all she could hear was the crowd chanting: Bex. Bex. Bex. Sound familiar?

BECCA	That's a nice story. Why don't you go rest up, maybe someone will be chanting your name tonight.

WINTER	All right.. I see how it is. But this conversation is not over. Bexy. Bex.

BECCA	Okay.

ZEKE	Did she say two bouncers? I remember three.

ZEKE	You're going to the pit right?

BECCA	What would you have me do?

ZEKE	Both of you should just go. Take Lily and leave.

BECCA	It's just a fight. What's the worst that can happen? She looses she's dead anyway.

ZEKE	You're wrong. Far worst things can happen.

SAM	I expect to see my daughters still alive. But if you don't help your sister I might not get to.

MICAH	Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the qualifying round of the Free Fighting Championship.

WINTER	That's right bitches come on.

MICAH	You know the game, you know the rules. Challengers that win advances to the next round. No weapons, no dying.

KATE	Gaby remember what I told you and you'll be just fine. One punch to the throat.

JONES	Mademoiselle Rebecca. Fancy seeing you here.

BECCA	Yeah...

JONES	How's the French coming along?

BECCA	Good. How are the bird houses?

JONES	Spectacular. Would you like to take a look?

BECCA	Fights are gonna start.

JONES	Nuh uh. No they won't start without me, I own the place. Shall we? It's right this way.

JONES	Claire, sunshine, would you be so kind and give us the room. Please?

BULL	Everything alright?

JONES	Spectacular! I'm just showing our new friend here what I've built.

BULL	I'll be right outside.

JONES	Awkward. She likes to mark her territory. She's very loyal that one. She's a part of my family now. Family means so much to me. Oh yeah. Speaking of family.

JONES	The jones family crest. Celtic in origin.

BECCA	Impressive.

JONES	Merci.

JONES	I come from a long line of degenerate drinkers and gamblers. But that's my family. You can't choose your family. You take the good with the bad. Do you gamble much?
BECCA	From time to time.

JONES	I don't. I lean more towards a secure investment. Guaranteed payouts.

BECCA	Is there such a thing?

JONES	Oui! Yes! Of course! One just has to look for the right opportunity, the right amount of risk versus the right amount of incentive CAN equal a guaranteed return on an investment. All though there are times where the variables don't add up, and usually, someone has tempered with an otherwise good formula. I wanna show you something. By the way who are you betting on tonight? Wait. Don't tell me. Don't tell me. Cause I already know.

JONES	Would you like an ice-cream?

BECCA	No thanks.

JONES	I've got lots of flavors.

JONES	Oops. I put Kate's old friends in time out.

JONES	Mmmm. They took my ice cream without my permission. So I had to set them free. (beat) Do you think Kate or any of her new friends have a chance at winning? Cause if none of them win... where's the guarantee? Who's gonna pay me back? (?? incoherent mouth full)

JONES	We inherit the problems. These are our issues now. I like Kate... but she's not very... How do you say smart?

JONES	What I do like is your father. Ah... there's a man. Who's willing to sacrifice himself to protect the flock.

JONES	Admirable. Little Kate... she's not apart of my family.

BECCA	When its done. The debt is paid. Don't come near her or our family again. Got it?

JONES	Yes I got it. (beat) Welcome back... bex.

WINTER	Baby face.

REMMY	Rough her up. Rough her up. Rough her up.

BECCA	Get out of there.

REMMY	Break it!

BECCA	Tap!

REMMY	Break it!

BECCA	She's gonna break your arm. Tap out!

REMMY	Break it!

BECCA	Tap!

WINTER	Piece of shit.

REMMY	That's it baby. You go for papa baby.

BABY FACE	Oh no honey you're good. You're good. You're good. But if you're gonna do it you might as well do it right. Go ahead. One more.

JONES	Two more chances

WINTER	That's what I'm talkin' about.

LISA	Come on Gaby, come on.

JONES	And now we're down to one.

LISA	Wakey wakey.

GABY	What are you doing?

JONES	Mmm... you smell lovely.

GABY	I won, right?

WINTER	Of course you did. Bitches are lined up outside so you can sign their titties! Look. Yo come on. Let's go. I need a drink. For real. Come on.

KATE	Come with us.

BECCA	I'm not going, and neither should you.

KATE	Becca the fight is in two days. I think I can handle one drink.

BECCA	Are you listening to yourself? You're the last one. You're it! If you loose, how are you going to pay this guy back? I can't do this.

KATE	Hey...

BECCA	I have a bad feeling about this.

KATE	It's gonna be fine. Look I know I've been a fuck up. But that's not who I am anymore.

LISA	Kiss and make up already.

KATE	Come with us.

BECCA	I'll see you tomorrow.

LISA	Come on Kate, let's get some poison tonight.

KATE	Get up.

FUCKFACE	I'll give you some poison.

GABY	You want a piece of this, fuckface?

FUCKFACE	Yes, please.

WINTER	Calm down.

GABY	I'm cool. I'm cool. I'm cool.

BECCA	Who is it?

POTTER	It's Potter.

BECCA	Hold on. It's stuck. Come down here.

POTTER	Hey.

BECCA	Hey.

POTTER	I'm not interrupting anything in here am I?

BECCA	No I was hitting the bags.

POTTE	I see. Did you work up an appetite.

BECC	I was gonna order from Joey's

BECCA	Okay. Okay.

POTTER	Alright.

POTTER	What?

BECCA	I needed this.

POTTER	Me too.

KATE	No.

BECCA	Well done, officer.

POTTER	You're mocking me.

BECCA	What are you gonna do about it?

POTTER	Don't make me get the handcuffs.

BECCA	Promises, promises.

BECCA	Hello?

DOCTOR	Hello this is doctor Badell from Las Vegas general. Is this Becca Holt?

BECCA	What?

DOCTOR	Is this Becca Holt? We have your sister here Kate Holt in ICU. We need you to come in immediately please.

BECCA	Where?

KATE	You look like shit!

BECCA	Hey champ.

KATE	Lily.

BECCA	She's fine. She's with Zeke.

KATE	Take care of her, okay?

BECCA	No. No. You'll be just fine. You can care of her yourself.

KATE	If I make it out of this, I won't make it out there.

BECCA	I love you.

ZEKE	I got about 25 grand stashed away...

BECCA	That's not enough.

ZEKE	What about you?

BECCA	I can handle one fight.

ZEKE	Yeah. Or maybe I should just follow you and call your ex and the calvary, and put an end to this bullshit you're getting yourself into.

BECCA	It's not gonna do any good and you know that. I just need to know you have Lily and dad if I can't pull this off.

ZEKE	You know I will. You know that. But what about you? How long has it been since you've fought? Huh? You think you're just gonna step in there and beat that monster? Shit Becca. Come on.
BECCA	Guaranteed payouts.

ZEKE	What?

SAM	Shit!

MENDOZA	Everything all right in there Holt?

SAM	No, but it will be.

MENDOZA	Don't hurt yourself now. Big day for you tomorrow.

SAM	And it will be for YOU if I don't get this system working.

MENDOZA	D Block can go a couple of days without hot water.

SAM	Oh yeah? Ever met the guys in D block?

MENDOZA	Nope. Never had the pleasure.

SAM	Well, pleasure is the last thing you get from those guys.

MENDOZA	Yeah well if you fix this we ain't gonna have no problems are we.

SAM	You know your water PH level is way off the charts right? You should have that checked out soon.

THUMBS	What are you fucking scientist now old man?

SAM	Um. Well I got a masters degree in chemical engineering, so.	Yes.

SAM	A high PH levels can cause corrosive damage on steel piping...like this one.

SAM	Not bad for an old man.

SAM	I don't know got into these guys.

MENDOZA	Holt!

SAM	They beat each other up pretty bad. I tried to stop them but they just wouldn't listen. (beat) Look, I don't want any trouble.

MENDOZA	Stop right there Holt.

SAM	If you're gonna shoot me with that tazer there's no guarantee its gonna paralyze me. And if it doesn't, Well, I don't know if I can keep my cool. If you know what I mean.

MENDOZA	Yeah.

SAM	Well, I did my job. I fixed that pipe, and in return what I would really love is to make a phone call.

MENDOZA	Yeah...

SAM	Good choice.

BECCA	She's asleep.

POTTER	What do you want to do now? I can help you.

BECCA	Paul Tardielo. Remember him?(beat) They found his blood smeared on my dad's shirt. Along with two others'. Remember?

POTTER	Yeah.

BECCA	He always had a sick obsession with her.

POTTER	And now he's dead. Your dad made sure of that when he bashed in his skull.

BECCA	But he didn't. He didn't find Kate crying that night. I did. I wanted to call the cops, I wanted to tell dad. But more than that... I just wanted them to die.

BECCA	They were laughing when I got there. I killed them. And I killed them some more. And I liked it. By the time Kate told dad.. and he got there is was too late for them. He gave me his hoodie. Covered my face and told me to walk straight home.

BECCA	And let my dad take a fall for a crime he didn't even commit.

BECCA	I thought it'd be fine if I left... you know? If I could just leave it behind.

BECCA	Every move has led me to this right now.

POTTER	Led you to what?

BECCA	Hello?

SAM	Are you okay?

BECCA	I'm fine dad. But Kate, she's gone.

SAM	Listen. Take Lily. Go to Bakersfield, I'll be there...

BECCA	No.

SAM	Listen to me. Try to understand what I'm trying to tell you.(pause)I know what you're thinking. If you do this and it doesn't work out well, everything we've done, these five years, everything will be for nothing. We'll be back where we started do you understand?

SAM	I can help you. We can fix this.

BECCA	I don't want to fix it. I want to end it.

MICAH	Rick, front door camera is out. Give it a look okay?

MICAH	Rick you there brov?

MICAH	Claire?

JONES	I understand. Uh huh. I get it. I'll make it up to you. Uh huh. I'll double the next fight. Uh huh. Yeah.

BULL	Landon... She's here.

JONES	Goddammit Micah find her.

JONES	What happened?

BULL	Landon. We need to leave. You know how this is gonna end. We can leave now.

JONES	No

MICAH	Are you mental brov? She just bashed a man's skull in. The fucking devil woman brov. I don't want none of it.

JONES	Not going anywhere. I built this place. I made you. (beat) I am not letting no mangy crow take down this nest. You hear that?(Calm)Claire. Sunshine. I want you to set her free.

MICAH	She's still breathing.

JONES	And what are you gonna do about it? Get her a band-aid? Leave her and kill that little bitch.

JONES	Did I studder? eh? Get the fuck out of my face.

JONES	May god hold you in the palm of his hand.

MICAH	I don't care what you do here... I'm not with this. Never have been. Don't underestimate him... and do it for Kate.

JONES	Micah?

JONES	All you had to do, was do what you do best. But no.. you had to fuck me. yeah well good for you.

JONES	Well I'll tell you what's going to happen now. I'm gonna play a little game. I'm gonna find your little fucking niece. I'm gonna choke her until she can't breath anymore. And then I'm gonna find your father and I'm gonna fucking kill him. This is the best deal you're gonna get.

JONES	Do you think you're the only monster here? Huh?

JONES	Need some air?

JONES	How sweet revenge is?

BECCA	This is not revenge. It's justice.

POTTER	I won't be able to make this go away.

BECCA	You won't need to.

POTTER	You know they're all going to come after you for this?

BECCA	I know...

POTTER	Why Becca?

BECCA	Sometimes our true nature isn't good enough.

BECCA	Sometimes, people deserve more than what the world has allowed them to be.

BECCA	Sometimes sacrifice needs to be rewarded.

POTTER	I can only buy you a couple days. That's it.

BECCA	That's enough.

POTTER	Where will you go?


BECCA	Hi.

SAM	Hey. Out of all the places...

SAM	Missed you?

SAM	So what do you think Lily?

LILY	I like it!
SAM	Yeah. Of course you do.
