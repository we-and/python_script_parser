CHARLIE	I can't see a thing in here. Ow! Will you cut it out?
ALEX	What?
CHARLIE	Get off my foot!
ALEX	That wasn't me. Hey, watch it.
NICK	Sorry. I think that was me.
ALEX	Big shock.
CHARLIE	Can somebody just find the flashlight?
NICK	Listen. 
CHARLIE	I don't hear anything.
ALEX	Hold on. I think I found it.
NICK	Wait. There it is again.
ALEX	You must have dog ears 'cause the only thing I hear is Charlie breathing. Let's just get out of here. This is really stupid.
CHARLIE	Yeah. Next time you hear that there's some kind of hideous, deformed creature living in some old abandoned building, do us a favor and leave us out of it.
NICK	Hey, I had a solid lead. Jeanie Taylor told Marti Nixon, and I heard her telling Ethan Reynolds about it in phys ed. Besides, I didn't know we were gonna end up trapped in a broom closet.
ALEX	That's a solid lead? Nice going, Goggles. You are so not cut out for this.
NICK	Hey, don't call me that.
CHARLIE	Would you two knock it off already? Trust me. Whatever it is you thought you heard, it's gone. Let's just go home.
CHARLIE	See? I told you there's nothing out here.
NICK	You were saying?
ALEX	That's gotta be the wind or something.
NICK	I'm leaning more toward "something."
CHARLIE	Come on. Let's check it out.
NICK	I don't think that's such a good idea.
CHARLIE	Fine. Stay here then.
ALEX	Yeah, stay here.
NICK	Uh, an even worse idea.
ALEX	What's that? 
NICK	Thermal camera. Monster tracker.
CHARLIE	Shh!I think I heard something.
NICK	What is it?
CHARLIE	Something's over there.
ALEX	I don't see anything.
NICK	Guys, I think we might wanna find another way out of here.
JAKE	Well, well, look what we got here. Our favorite middle school wimps, the Monster Geek Squad.
NICK	Actually, it's Elite Monster Hunting Unit, you Neanderthal.
JAKE	Ah, get up. Come on.
ALEX	I don't see anything.
NICK	Guys, I think we might wanna find another way out of here.
JAKE	Well, well, look what we got here.	 Our favorite middle school wimps, the Monster Geek Squad.
NICK	Actually, it's Elite Monster Hunting Unit, you Neanderthal.
JAKE	Ah, get up. Come on.
CARTER	Neanderthal? That sounds bad. It has a bunch of those, uh, whatcha-macallems.
ALEX	Syllables, moron.
CARTER	Oh, yeah? How about a bruise for every syllable? Ne-an-der-thal! 
JAKE	What's wrong, dorks? No science club today, so you thought you try out a life of crime, huh? A little breaking and entering?
NICK	Truth be told, we were chasing down an unidentified beast-like creature right inside that old building. We have it trapped in there. 
JAKE	Cork it, geek boy. Nobody's talking to you. What gives, Charlie? What are you and the dork patrol doing messing around in the old bank?
ALEX	None of your business.
BRENT	Whoa! Take it down a notch, Brainiac, or you'll be chewing on a knuckle sandwich. A triple decker.
CARTER	Yeah, what's with this jacket anyway? You wear this stupid thing every day.
JAKE	He thinks he's going to Hartford someday. Uh, doubt it! 
CHARLIE	It's Harvard, you meathead. You know, you might've thought high school would've made you a little bit smarter. And that jacket belonged to his brother, the marine.
BRENT	Where are the marines when we need 'em?
JAKE	A beast-like creature? Could you be bigger wimps? Figures dorks like you would be afraid of a little kitty cat. Wait till all the other losers at their school hear about this.
JAKE	You're dead meat, Hamilton!
GIRL	Nice costume, dork.
CHARLIE	I told you. Hardly anyone else is wearing a costume. I feel like a total idiot.
ALEX	Dude, it's Halloween. We always wear costumes.
CHARLIE	Don't you think we might be getting a little bit old for this kind of stuff?
ALEX	No.	
NICK	Guys, it finally came! Swamp Monsters ! The one where the swap alien has to battle the zombie slime creatures. Ends up having to eat his own head!
BRANDY	Hey, Charlie.
CHARLIE	Oh! Brandi, hey. How's it going?
BRANDY	Did you finish your chapter for the chem lab notes last night?
CHARLIE	Oh, yeah, the chem lab. Absolutely. I got 'em right here.
CHARLIE	Come on, come on.
CHARLIE	Wait.
ANGELA	Nice costume. You supposed to be a dog or something?
CHARLIE	Oh, no. Werewolf, actually.
BRANDY	It's cute.
CHARLIE	Yeah, we were actually just making fun of all the losers that actually wear costumes, yeah. Usually we're way more mature--
BRANDY	I can see that.
CHARLIE	Oh, great.
ALEX	We can run. I hear Mexico's lovely this time of year.
JAKE	What's this? "A guide to demons,	monsters and aliens." Ooh. Which chapter are you in?
BRANDY	This is so lame, Jake. Just leave him alone.
JAKE	Oh, hey, look, it's the geek patrol. Not so bad when you're not, armed with a milkshake, are you? 
BRANDY	Serious, Jake. I'm gonna tell Mom!
CHARLIE	Hey, why don't you guys knock it off? What's the matter? Run out of kids to play at your own school, you had to come back here?
BRANDY	Jake!
JAKE	How much grass do you think Charlie here could eat before he chucks it all up, huh? Maybe we should find out.
ALEX	Get off of him!
CARTER	How about a game, twerps?
JAKE	Oh, get real. These losers couldn't play football against my grandma's knitting club. And those old bags can't even walk.
CHARLIE	Yeah, we were thinking about taking the day off from anything that requires the human brain. So yeah, maybe football might just do the trick.
JAKE	What did you say, geek boy? It sounded like an insult, but no, that can't be right.What would require guts, which you and the wimp brigade don't have.
NICK	Charlie, you're not exactly helping here.
CHARLIE	Any rock for brains can throw a football. Well, apparently not anyone, since you and your team have lost almost every game this year and set the record for most interceptions in a season.
JAKE	Oh, really? Let's see you do this, Einstein. 
JAKE	Uh, you were saying?
CHARLIE	I was saying that it doesn't take much for a bunch of morons to go out on the court and bash each other's brains in.
BRENT	It's a field, professor, not a court.
JAKE	All right, all right, Charlie, I got something for you, now that you're Mr. Big and Bold.
CHARLIE	 Let's hear it. Name your challenge.
JAKE	All right. Uh... The old Sullivan place. One night. You and the geek squad spend an entire night up there.
CHARLIE	Excuse me?
JAKE	Oh, you heard me. The Sullivan house. One night.
CHARLIE	Isn't that place supposed to be haunted?
CARTER	Oh, is it? Yeah, that's the point, loser. You guys think you're some kind of monster experts? Prove it.
JAKE	That's what I thought.
CHARLIE	Name the time and place. We'll be there.
JAKE	Tomorrow. Halloween.
CHARLIE	Done.
JAKE	Okay, Charlie. It's your funeral. Behind the school, bike path. Tomorrow. :. Be there.
NICK	What did you just get us into? Please tell me this is a dream.
ALEX	I think the word is nightmare.
CHARLIE	Come on, guys! Are we gonna let them show us up for the rest of our lives? How many more swirlies and wedgies and wet willies are we gonna have to take?
NICK	I don't know, Charlie, but I'd rather take more of what they're dishing out than go near that Sullivan house.
ALEX	Yeah, Charlie, the house is haunted. Not sure what's confusing about that.
CHARLIE	And you guys actually believe that?
NICK	Yeah. Why wouldn't we?
ALEX	You just want us to come with you.
CHARLIE	Guys, we're gonna be in the same school as them next year. Do you really wanna be a punching bag for those jerks till we graduate? Fine. I'm done.
ALEX	So… what do you have in mind?
NICK	Yeah, what's the plan?
CHARLIE	Meet me at my house at six. I'll lay it out for you guys.
ALEX	So you mean you'll make it up as you go?
CHARLIE	Exactly.
CAROL	Charlie, I wish you'd drink more milk. Stop with all that soda.
CHARLIE	I'm allergic to milk, Mom, remember? I haven't had a soda in like forever.
TODD	Yeah. He's allergic to everything, especially girls.
CHARLIE	Zip it, runt.
TODD	Oh, no! You don't still have the hots for the girl in your chemistry lab, do you?
CHARLIE	I'm serious, Todd. 
TODD	I've got a better idea. Why don't you come over here and make me zip it? Hey! He threw his peas at me!
CHARLIE	And they say you can't train a baby.
CAROL	Charlie, Todd, stop it. Just eat. I got you some almond milk. They say it's better for your digestive tract.
TODD	Yeah, Charles. Or how about some of Noah's baby formula?
CHARLIE	I'm warning you, Todd.
TODD	Warning me how?
RUSS	Sit down and be quiet, Todd, or I'm gonna let Charlie have five minutes alone with you off the leash.
TODD	Not cool, Russ!
NICK	Hey, guys, you might wanna come over here and read this.
NICK	During the 's, the Sullivan Gang was rumored to be responsible for over thirty bank robberies in California alone.  They were finally killed in a shootout right here in Elk Falls at their hideout, the old Sullivan place. Cops said it was a total bloodbath, like body parts everywhere! It also says the place is supposed to be haunted by the gang and their vicious old dog Salty.
ALEX	Haunted by a dog? Let me see that. Over the years, many citizens of Elk Falls have reported hearing strange noises coming from the house, which to this day remains abandoned due to an ongoing dispute over ownership and the city's inability to find a buyer willing to take on the troubled property.
NICK	Dude! Look at these guys. They look like total psychos.
ALEX	Hey, dude, this one looks just like you, Goggles.
CHARLIE	Haunted by a dog? What a bunch of baloney. The place is just old. We're doing this. End of story.
ALEX	Yeah, we kind of have to. We chicken out now, our lives at Joe Dante Middle School are gonna suck. Probably high school too.
NICK	It already sucks.
CHARLIE	Yeah, but we're talking about it going to an entirely new level.
NICK	How are we gonna get our parents to let us stay the night in that old house?
CHARLIE	It's simple. We tell our parents that we're staying over at each other's houses, and by morning we're heroes. Jake and those other lug-nuts won't be able to push us around anymore.
NICK	I gotta go home. My mom's making something that vaguely resembles meatloaf. If I don't get there soon, my sister will give hers to the dog before I can.
CHARLIE	Remember, we meet behind the school tomorrow at six.
NICK	Does this mean no trick or treating?
ALEX	What do you think?
CHARLIE	This will be better. Trust me.
NICK	Oh, okay, Charlie.
ALEX	See you tomorrow night, Charlie.
RUSS	No, you won't. You got your new wrestling coach coming over tomorrow night, remember?
NICK	Charlie doesn't wrestle.
CHARLIE	I hate wrestling Dad.
RUSS	Well, that's why you're gonna take lessons.
CHARLIE	That doesn't make any sense.
RUSS	You need to do something more physical, okay? You're wasting too much time on your computers.
ALEX	What kind of wrestling coach comes over on Halloween anyway?
RUSS	Bye, boys.
CHARLIE	But, Dad, we have a big geometry test coming up. We're in a study group together. I can't let my friends down.
RUSS	What about letting your dad down?
CHARLIE	Day after tomorrow. I promise.
RUSS	I expect to see an A on that test.
TODD	Geometry test, huh? I know what you guys are doing.
CHARLIE	You don't know anything.
TODD	Really? Maybe we should have a talk with mom and dad then.
CHARLIE	I'll do your homework for a week. You're not getting my bank. 
TODD	I already looked in there. There's not enough.  bucks. That's the price for my silence.
ALEX	I'll kill him for free.
CHARLIE	Deal. Not a word.
TODD	And you're doing my homework.
JAKE	I'm impressed. I didn't think you guys would show.
CHARLIE	This is a piece of cake.
JAKE	If you're doing this for my sister, forget about it. You got no shot with her.
CHARLIE	I'm doing this because I'm tired of you guys always giving us a hard time. We do this, you guys back off. Deal?
JAKE	Deal, but I won't hold my breath. You clowns ready?
CHARLIE	Born ready.
CARTER	Yeah, well, talk's cheap, professor. Smart money says you won't make it till dark.
BRENT	I bet they don't even go inside.
CHARLIE	Let's just do this.
BRANDY	Are you sure about this, Charlie? You don't have to.
JAKE	Sure he is! The dare is you stay the entire night. Of course, if you decide to split early, YouTube and the whole rest of the world will be watching. You guys will be on hidden cameras all night. Uh, bye, boys. 
ANGELA	Can we go now, please?
NICK	What are you doing? We didn't even get to the house yet.
RUSS	My dad. We're supposed to be studying for a math test at your house, remember? Come on, let's go.
ALEX	Ohh...
NICK	Are we almost there yet, Charlie?
CHARLIE	Almost.
ALEX	Hey, did you read the new Zombie Invasion comic?
NICK	Yes. It was awesome, wasn't it?
ALEX	Dude, it was awesome. I like the Zombie Warrior better.
NICK	Well, yeah, because that was the first one. I mean, it's expected.
NICK	What now?
ALEX	How we getting in this place?
CHARLIE	Come on.
CHARLIE	There. That's our entrance. We pry that wood off and slip inside.
CHARLIE	Let's see here.
NICK	We're sure we really wanna do this?
ALEX	Don't chicken out now, Nick. They could be watching us on those cameras.
CHARLIE	No turning back now.
JAKE	This is way too easy. This is gonna be an awesome night. Meet up at my place in an hour. Make sure everything's ready.
CARTER	I got this.
JAKE	Tonight those dipsticks are gonna get a double dose of ghost.
ANGELA	Do you guys really have cameras in there?
BRENT	Jake's dad works security.
JAKE	He gave me a few toys. Heighten the experience a little. Plus we gotta make sure your friends don't wuss out.
BRANDY	Don't you think that's kind of mean, Jake ?
JAKE 	Absolutely!
BRENT	Jake's dad works security.
JAKE	He gave me a few toys. Heighten the experience a little. Plus we gotta make sure your friends don't wuss out.
BRANDY	Don't you think that's kind of mean, Jake ?
JAKE	Absolutely!
CHARLIE	Oh, my face.
ALEX	Ah, would you get off me, please? 
NICK	I'm trying!
CHARLIE	Man, that's higher than I thought. I don't think we could get back out that way even if we wanted to.
NICK	Great! So we're trapped in here?
ALEX	We shouldn't even be here, Charlie. This is all your fault.
NICK	Yeah! I had my Grim Reaper superhero costume all ready to go for tonight. But no! I'm trapped here in this stupid old haunted house with you guys.
CHARLIE	Would you guys calm down? You whine worse than my baby brother.
ALEX	So you're calling us babies?
CHARLIE	Yeah. Snot-nosed little diaper-wearing babies.
ALEX	Okay, that's it. I'm done. Party's over. Give me a boost, Nick.
NICK	No way. You give me a boost.
CHARLIE	Guys, you really want wanna leave? Aren't you tired of those jerks always getting the best of us? This is our chance to show everyone what we're made of. We go, back out that window now, we can never show our faces in school again. We can do this! You know we can. Unless you really think we're the gutless losers they say we are.
ALEX	We're not losers.
CHARLIE	So prove it. Come on, guys.
ALEX	Forget those guys. Right?
NICK	I guess.
CHARLIE	Let's take inventory. Supply check.
NICK	I brought the entertainment. Ipad, video game, DVD, DS and GPS, just in case. Oh, and, uh, this.
CHARLIE	Nice touch.
NICK	Thought you'd appreciate the irony.
ALEX	I brought the food : chips, salsa-- not too spicy--drinks, chocolate-covered Debby cakes and my personal favorite, Hungry Boy fried chicken dinners!
NICK	These are frozen dinners.
ALEX	They'll thaw out by the time we eat 'em.
CHARLIE	All right, so I brought batteries, matches, non-drip candles. No one will ever know that we were here.
ALEX	What about the window?
CHARLIE	Cat did it. Oh, and these. Standard army flashlights. They're the real deal.
NICK	No, thanks. I have my Cactus Jack Ranger pocket knife. It has a light built into it. Look.
ALEX	You get that out of a cereal box?
NICK	It's for small, tight spaces.
ALEX	Like your brain?
CHARLIE	Let's take a look around and find a place to settle down for the night.
NICK	Maybe we should just stay right here.
ALEX	In a dusty old basement? I don't think so.
CHARLIE	Look, let's just go. This place smells like a dungeon.
CHARLIE	Ready?
ALEX	Be quiet, just in case.
NICK	Just in case what?
ALEX	In case the bloody, rotting corpses of the Sullivan Gang are still living upstairs.
NICK	That's not funny.
CHARLIE	Hello! Anyone home?
ALEX	Are you crazy, Charlie?
CHARLIE	It's just us. Let's go. 
CHARLIE	You guys waiting for a formal invitation? 
NICK	Maybe we could go back downstairs. They'll never know.
CHARLIE	Rangers never retreat, Nick.
CHARLIE	You guys coming or what?
ALEX	What do you see?
CHARLIE	Uh, a big empty house. See for yourself.
CHARLIE	Whoa. Look at that.
NICK	Wow.
NICK	This is pretty cool.
CHARLIE	Yeah, see? No ghosts,	no Sullivan Gang, no Salty.
NICK	Yeah.
ALEX	Hey, I found the perfect spot for us.
CHARLIE	And the best part? After tomorrow, no more Jake and his meathead friends bothering us.
NICK	I have to admit, I thought you were out of your gourd for getting us into this.
ALEX	Yeah, this actually turned out to be a pretty good idea, Charlie. So if you Neanderthals are watching us, hello from the haunted house! Jake, help us! Zombies got us and turned us into the living dead.
NICK	Yeah, please tell our teachers we won't be coming back to school anymore. They can give our homework to someone else.
NICK	You really think the Sullivan Gang ever lived here?
CHARLIE	I don't know. Doesn't really matter though. I mean, you saw all the furniture in there. Somebody lived here. A long time ago anyway.
ALEX	And besides,  there's no such thing as ghosts.
NICK	That's what they always say in the movies right before one shows up and rips their face off.
CHARLIE	Wow, that's really pretty.
ALEX	Yeah, just like Brandy Benson.
CHARLIE	Don't even, Alex.
NICK	Gotta admit, Charlie, we wouldn't be here right now if Brandy wasn't standing there yesterday. 
CHARLIE	Yup. You'd be out trick or treating just like you always do. 
NICK	What's wrong with trick or treating?
CHARLIE	It's for kids.
NICK	Oh, yeah. So what's that make you, some kinda grownup?
ALEX	Truce, guys. Look at this. Sunset, three friends. This is a total beer commercial moment. You guys are ruining it.
CHARLIE	Okay, but he started it. And yeah, Brandy Benson is beautiful.
ALEX	What are you doing?
NICK	Tempting fate. That's what Rangers do.
ALEX	Dude, that's what idiots do. Get over here.
CHARLIE	Come on, dude.
ALEX	Nick, man, come on.
ALEX	I don't remember it being this dark in here.
CHARLIE	What are you doing now?
NICK	Seeing if any of the light switches work.
CHARLIE	Oh, that'd be a great idea if there were any lights to turn on, but there aren't. So just stay close, okay?
NICK	Did we leave the door open?
ALEX	What is that down there?
CHARLIE	It's just the wind.
NICK	I thought I heard it say something.
ALEX	Nick, I'm coming to get you!
NICK	If it gets me, I promise, it's getting you first.
JAKE	That's right, boys. Make yourselves comfortable. It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
BRENT	Hey, when do the ghosts arrive?
JAKE	Hey, patience, amigo. They'll be making a house call very soon. I got it all wired into that single unit. You can control it all from here.
CARTER	You promised I could do this part, Jake.
JAKE	And I am a man of my word.
NICK	I've never eaten a frozen drumstick before. 
CHARLIE	Just suck on it until it melts, then you can bite into it.
ALEX	Sorry. I had to grab whatever I could before my mom asked me where I was going with three Hungry Boy meals.
NICK	This piece is a little softer.  Kinda slushy. Not bad.
MOVIE ON TV	Hey, Danny won't get up. 
MOVIE ON TV	Get out! Danny, look out!
RUSS	What?
CAROL	Nothing. Sometimes I think you're a little hard on Charlie, that's all.
RUSS	No. My old man was hard on me. I had a job when I was . These kids live lives of leisure.
CAROL	It wouldn't kill you to try a little harder. That's all I'm saying.
RUSS	I asked him to help me fix the car last weekend, and he said no. What am I gonna do?
CAROL	He's a smart kid. He likes what he likes. Did you ever think maybe that doesn't include wrestling or fixing a car?
RUSS	What kids don't like wrestling and fixing cars?
CAROL	It might be nice to take an interest in the things that he's interested in. Charlie's growing up. Todd too. We have this tiny little window where they actually still want to be with us. You're missing it.
CAROL	Ohh! I think Noah needs a new diaper. Can you smell his butt for me?
RUSS	Okay, Todd, let's go! We're gonna go get dinner. Get in the car.
TODD	Aw, man!
RUSS	Shut up, Todd!
GIRL	Go on. 
BOY	Yeah, do it.
ALEX	Boooo!
ALEX	This is so much better than trick or treating. 
NICK	Ooh! Smarties! Dibs!
NICK	Ah! Check it out. I added the skull there, plus the hand coming out of the grave.
CHARLIE	Dude, you wrote that on your science book?
NICK	Yeah, it was either that or study photosynthesis.
CHARLIE	What if somebody sees it?
ALEX	You bring Zombie Invasion ? Oh ho ho!  Who do you think would win in a fight: the Zombie Warrior or the big plant monster from Tales of Terror ?
CHARLIE	Can we talk about something other than that stupid kid stuff all the time?
ALEX	I like being a kid.
NICK	Yeah, what's so great about being a grownup anyway? The only thing I ever hear my parents talking about are bills, how come you didn't stop at the grocery store on the way home, or how to like lower your cholesterol and stuff.
ALEX	Okay Mr. Grownup, you promised to tell us the Brandy story. Let's hear it.
NICK	Yeah, what is it about that girl that makes you volunteer to do crazy stuff like this? It's not normal.
CHARLIE	It's not much of a story.
ALEX	Okay, you can hardly remember your name when she's around. That's something.
CHARLIE	Well, it all started...Oh, it was last summer. I was on my way home from the pool, and I saw Brandy's dad doing some yard work, and I asked him if I could give him a hand.
NICK	And he said, "Sure. Come marry my beautiful daughter."
CHARLIE	No. Then I spent the next two hours bagging up all the leaves and stuff and taking them out to the curb.
ALEX	What does that have to do with Brandy?
CHARLIE	Well, when I was finished, Mr. Benson goes inside, and a few minutes later...
CHARLIE	Brandy comes out to give me some money for the work. It was like everything just stopped.
ALEX	Then what happened?
CHARLIE	Then I said goodbye and left.
NICK	That's it?
ALEX	So she touched your hand, and you've been gaga over her ever since?
CHARLIE	Pretty much.
NICK	What was that?
CHARLIE	Let's find out.
NICK	No way. I'm staying right here.
ALEX	Your choice. We'll be right back.
NICK	You guys can't leave me here alone.
ALEX	Watch us.
CHARLIE	All right, then give me your Cactus Jack Ranger knife.
NICK	No way. I'm coming with you.
JAKE	What are you doing? We're not supposed to hit 'em with the big guns till later.
CARTER	I-I didn't do anything. That wasn't me.
CHARLIE	Odds or evens.
ALEX	What?
CHARLIE	To see who goes in first.
NICK	This whole thing was your idea, fearless leader. I nominate you.
NICK	Just so you know, if it's some maniac with a chainsaw, I'm leaving you guys in the dust.
NICK	Charlie...
CHARLIE	Shh!
ALEX	You can put the knife away, Goggles. It's just a branch. Must have broke off in the wind.
NICK	Hey, a Ranger can never be too careful.
WOMAN	You got mashed potatoes on that?
TODD	Get me the -piece extra crispy combo, Russ. Wings and drumsticks only. 
RUSS	You think you could call me Dad, at least while we're in public? 
TODD	Okay, Dad. White meat, extra sauce. 
BRANDY	Can I help you with something? 
TODD	You're Brandy Benson. 
BRANDY	Do I know you? 
TODD	You're the screen saver on my brother's computer. Your picture. He stares at it all day. 
BRANDY	And your brother is... 
TODD	Charlie. Charlie Hamilton.
 ANGELA	I told you he was a stalker. 
TODD	You know, he's only doing this to impress you.
BRANDY	What do you mean?
TODD	I know all about him spending the night in the old Sullivan Place. Him and the other two rocket scientists he hangs out with. You're prettier in person.
ANGELA	What a weirdo.
BRANDY	I'm worried about Charlie. I should have never let him agree to this stupid thing in the first place.

ANGELA	First of all, you didn't let him do anything. He made his own bed. Now he has to sleep in it. That bed just happens to be in an incredibly scary old haunted house.
ALEX	Just lightning.
CHARLIE	Think I'll keep this on just in case.
NICK	Just in case what?
ALEX	Had to be the basement door, right?
CHARLIE	Yeah. Just the wind.
ALEX	Okay, the wind blows the door shut. I heard it slam. So how exactly does the wind blow it open again?
NICK	Okay, Mr. It's-just-the-wind, you wanna explain that one to me?
CARTER	Your dad's gear is completely off the hook! Dude, look at those little losers! You got the place totally rigged!
JAKE	That's nothing. Check it out. I bet this scares 'em right out of the house.
NICK	What was that?
ALEX	There's someone in here with us.
NICK	I say we get the heck out of here. I've said uncle enough times in my life to know when to say it, Charlie, and this is one of those times.
ALEX	He's right. Let's get out of here, Charlie. To heck with the bet.
CHARLIE	I'm not leaving. I've always wondered what a ghost looked like up close.
ALEX	Are you crazy?
CHARLIE	Nope. I just don't believe in ghosts.
CHARLIE	If I don't make it back...make sure Todd doesn't get my  dollars.
CHARLIE	God! Ohh...
ALEX	Didn't want you to have all the fun.
CHARLIE	Hello?
CHARLIE	Help me with this, you guys!
CHARLIE	Okay, put your backs up against it.
ALEX	Turn your light on, Charlie. I can't see a thing in here.
CHARLIE	It's out there. I dropped it.
NICK	Nice going, Charlie.
CHARLIE	Where's your Cactus Jack Ranger light?
NICK	I left it in my sleeping bag.
ALEX	Well, we're not getting out this way.
NICK	What time is it?
ALEX	What does that matter?
NICK	Sunrise is : a.m. I looked it up. I say we stay right here until it's light, then we make a break for the front door.
CHARLIE	Look, if whatever it is that's out there wanted to hurt us, it would've done it already. Maybe it's just trying to scare us.
ALEX	It's doing a pretty good job.
NICK	Did you just see that? That sheet just moved.
ALEX	Maybe it's just the wind again.
NICK	There is no wind in this room.
CHARLIE	What am I looking at?
NICK	I could've sworn that thing moved.
CHARLIE	Look, there's gotta be a logical explanation for all this. This house is really old, and it's got creaks and drafts and all kinds of crazy stuff.
NICK	Just like my Grandma Arletta. It's moving again.
CHARLIE	Didn't we just go through this?
NICK	Guys... 
ALEX	Charlie... I think he's right.
CHARLIE	Run!
NICK	Which way? 
CHARLIE	Anywhere but here! Go!
CHARLIE	Oh, are you all right? 
NICK	I tripped over something.
ALEX	I think you tripped over this.
NICK	What is it?
CHARLIE	Come on.
CHARLIE	Just as I thought. Jake. Him and his meathead friends rigged all of this up so that we'd leave and they'd win the bet. I mean, think about it. The slamming doors, the scary footsteps. Come on.
ALEX	Let's see what else they set up for us.
NICK	Yeah. Maybe we can give them a little surprise.
RUSS	Carol, we're out of candy!
BRANDY	Mr. Hamilton? There's something I need to tell you.
CARTER	Whoa, whoa, what's going on? I told you not to touch anything.
BRENT	I didn't touch anything.
JAKE	Well, then what happened to the picture?
BRENT	Maybe a ghost got 'em.
JAKE	Very funny. We're missing all the action.
CARTER	Reboot it.
BRENT	I did. It's not working.
JAKE	Come on. Let's go get a closer look.
CARTER	Uh, how close exactly?
JAKE	Front row seats.
RUSS	So you knew your brother was sneaking off to pull this crazy stunt, and you didn't tell anybody?
TODD	Dad, he begged me.
RUSS	I don't want to hear another word from you!  25 dollars. Is that what a lie goes for these days?
BRANDY	Mr. Hamilton, Charlie was really determined. Charlie and his friends lied. What if they got hurt or they needed help? I wouldn't even know where to find them.
BRANDY	Mr. Hamilton, didn't you do anything like this when you were a kid?
TODD	My dad was never a kid.
RUSS	All right, get in the van, Todd. I'm not done with you. Come on, I'll give you a ride home. And then I'm gonna deal with this nonsense. Let's go.
TODD	Watch it, Russ.
CHARLIE	There's your Sullivan Gang ghosts. All in one neat little pile. 	This is Jake's dad's stuff. 	That's how they rigged the entire house. That's also how they made all the doors close and stuff. 
ALEX	No ghosts, huh?
NICK	You sound disappointed.
ALEX	A little.
NICK	Maybe we should just leave now. They'll never know the difference.
CHARLIE	Forget about that. Look, when we walk out of here tomorrow morning, I wanna see the look on Jake and his friends' faces when we throw all of this stuff right back at 'em.
ALEX	Neanderthals!
CHARLIE	But before we go, let's take one last look around to make sure that there aren't any more surprises, please?
JAKE	Come on. Hey, let's check out all the windows and meet back here, all right? We'll see who has the best view inside. And don't make any noise.
JAKE	Those little dorks think they're so smart, don't they?
BRANDY	You're mad, aren't you?
RUSS	Good night, Brandy. Sorry you had to get dragged through all this.
BRANDY	I'm not. Charlie's my friend.
BRANDY	I know he lied to you, Mr. Hamilton, but it was for a good reason.
RUSS	Yeah, to prove to those other kids he's some kind of tough guy.
BRANDY	That's not Charlie, Mr. Hamilton. I think he did it to prove to himself he wasn't afraid. It's not easy being a kid, you know, especially when you're afraid all the time.
RUSS	What would you know about that?
BRANDY	I'm scared all the time... that people won't like me, that I'll disappoint my parents, that people will realize I'm just a dork just like everybody else, and I won't be popular anymore. I guess it's tough being a kid sometimes.
TODD	That's exactly what I've been trying to tell you, Russ.
RUSS	Shut up, Todd.
BRENT	There's nothing back there.
CARTER	Same here. Rooms are all empty.
JAKE	They're in there. I just saw a flashlight in the hallway. Hold on. I think they're coming back. Oh, I think I see something.
ALEX	You hear that?
CHARLIE	Guess it was nothing.
ALEX	Man, this was so much more fun than trick or treating.
NICK	There's always next year.
CHARLIE	You'll be  next year.
NICK	Hey, as long as people are giving out candy, I'm putting on a costume. I don't care if I'm .
CARTER	What was that?
BRENT	Some kind of prehistoric monster.
JAKE	There's no such thing!
CARTER	What was it then? Big teeth, red eyes, claws to rip your face off?
JAKE	Whatever it was, those little twerps are stuck in there with it.
CARTER	Shouldn't we do something?
JAKE	Yeah. Yeah, go home and keep your mouths shut. Those big-shots want to show us how tough they are? Now's their chance. Unless... you want to go back and help 'em. Yeah, that's what I thought. Let's go.
RUSS	Okay, this is where you get out. Go.
TODD	What are you gonna do?
RUSS	I'm not sure yet.
TODD 	You mean there's a chance I can still get my $?
RUSS	You're such an idiot. Go in the house and tell your mother I'll call her in a few minutes.
TODD	I want to go with you.
RUSS	That's not happening. Good night.
TODD	I'm serious!
RUSS	So am I. Go inside.
TODD	Look, I know I'm not the best brother a kid could have...
RUSS	You think?
TODD	But I do care about Charlie. I want to see if he's okay.
RUSS	Put your seatbelt back on. We're going.
TODD	Okay, so maybe I want to protect my investment too.
RUSS	Shut up, Todd.
CHARLIE	'Night, guys.
NICK	Leave your light on, Charlie.
CHARLIE	Okay.
ALEX	Yeah. No more scary bedtime stories.
CHARLIE	I think the excitement's over for the night. See you guys in the morning.
ALEX	Yeah, good night.
CAROL	I think that's a terrible idea.
RUSS	Will you just listen for one minute?
CAROL	He lied, Russ. His friends too. We have to tell their parents.
RUSS	I'm not condoning what he did.
CAROL	If we let them stay the night in that house, it's like saying the lying was okay.
RUSS	He's gonna be punished, I promise. 
TODD	Yeah, be tough, Russ.
RUSS	You zip it or you're walking home.
CAROL	I don't know, Russ. Don't try to tell me this is some kind of guy-thing.
RUSS	Well, it kind of is. Charlie's friend Brandy was right. He should stay the night in the house, see something through. He could learn that way.
CAROL	Honesty's what he needs to learn.
RUSS	If he asked us to let him stay the night in this old house 
CAROL	We would've said no.
RUSS	Exactly. He's . He's trying to figure out how to be a man. You told me I should take interest in what he's doing, so why don't you let me? Nothing's gonna happen to him. Todd and I are sitting right outside the door. If I see any kind of trouble, I'll pull the plug.
CAROL	All right, Russ, but this one is on you.
RUSS	I will see you in the morning.
TODD	Thanks again for letting me come, Russ.
RUSS	Ah, well, just keep an eye on the house.
CHARLIE	Alex, Nick, wake up.
ALEX	What's up?
CHARLIE	There's something going on over there.
NICK	I thought we found all of Jake's little toys.
CHARLIE	Well, apparently we didn't. Go check it out.
CHARLIE	What are you doing?
NICK	I'm getting my Ranger knife.
ALEX	For what?
NICK	You never know. Hey, Danger is my middle name.
CHARLIE	Did they Did they drop you on your head as a kid?
NICK	Only once.
CHARLIE	It is so somebody else's turn.
NICK	Go ahead. Just do it already.
CHARLIE	It must have turned on by accident.
ALEX	You guys see a remote anywhere?
CHARLIE	I'm pretty sure this TV was made before remote controls were invented.
NICK	Maybe there was a power surge.
CHARLIE	There is no power in this house. How can there be a power surge?
NICK	Uh, guys? It's not plugged in.
CHARLIE	Let's not overreact.
ALEX	How do you explain the TV?
CHARLIE	I can't, okay? But it's not the time to panic.
TV ANCHORMAN	Dateline: Elk Falls. The tale of the band of notorious outlaws known as the Sullivan Gang...
NICK	It's about the Sullivan Gang!
TV ANCHORMAN	Local authorities have announced that they in fact have the Sullivans, wanted in connection with over  bank robberies since , surrounded at their hideout in Elk Falls. The Sullivan Gang...
ALEX	I think it's time to panic. Let's get out of here.
NICK	I'll see you out front.
TV ANCHORMAN	...is sure to be a fateful clash with local police.
NICK	Let me try!
ALEX	We're locked in!
NICK	I'm not liking this one bit.
CHARLIE	The back door. Very slowly.
ALEX	What the heck is that?
NICK	What was that?
CHARLIE	I don't know. You wanna go back and ask?
NICK	What now?
ALEX	Put your light on it.
CHARLIE	The batteries are dead. Where's yours?
ALEX	I left it by my sleeping bag.
NICK	Nice work, Sherlock.
ALEX	Run!
NICK	Where?
CHARLIE	This way!
NICK	In here, quick!
CHARLIE	Wait, wait, wait. How do we know it's safe in there?
NICK	We'll take our chances.
CHARLIE	Me too.
CHARLIE	Lock the door, Alex! 
ALEX	There is no lock!
NICK	I want to go home.
CHARLIE	Nothing gets through this door.
ALEX	What was that? It sure wasn't Jake and his friends.
CHARLIE	I don't know, and I don't want to find out.
CHARLIE	Go away! Leave us alone!
NICK	I think whatever was out there is gone.
ALEX	What if it's waiting for us to open the door?
CHARLIE	We have to open it eventually.
NICK	No, we don't.
CHARLIE	So we stay here until...
ALEX	College?
NICK	Or until our parents come to find us.
CHARLIE	Yeah, then-- then they'll kill us.
NICK	Parents I can deal with.
CHARLIE	Whatever that thing is, it's three of us versus one of them.
ALEX	What exactly is the "them?"
CHARLIE	I don't know, but if we stick together, we'll be okay. Not a sound.
CHARLIE	We leave this room, we go right, feet to the back door and outta here. Don't stop for anything.
ALEX	What about our stuff?
NICK	I don't think your mom will miss the TV dinners.
CHARLIE	Let's go.
NICK	Charlie...
CHARLIE	Whew!
ALEX	That was nuts! 
NICK	Totally.
CHARLIE	I've never been so scared in my life.
ALEX	What was that in there?
NICK	A ghost! Tons of them!
CHARLIE	I don't know. We didn't exactly get a very good look at it.
ALEX	What was that fireball or the red eyes or that scratching on the closet door? That wasn't the wind.
NICK	What happens when we see Jake?
CHARLIE	We'll worry about that tomorrow.
ALEX	Tomorrow should be here in about two hours.
CHARLIE	Well, we'll come back then, wait for 'em and win the bet.
NICK	How do you figure that?
CHARLIE	Well, we took out all of Jake's cameras and stuff, so now they won't have any idea that we're not in the house anymore. Let's go home, boys. 
NICK	Yeah.
CHARLIE	Are you coming or what?
ALEX	I have to go back in there.
CHARLIE	What are you talking about?
ALEX	I left my jacket. I have to go back in there and get it.
CHARLIE	It's just a jacket, Alex.
ALEX	I can't leave it in there. Who knows what'll happen to it.
CHARLIE	Whatever happens to it is gonna happen to you too. I mean, maybe when it's light, we could--
ALEX	I'm not asking you to come.
NICK	What's the problem?
CHARLIE	Alex wants to go back in there to get his raggedy old jacket.
ALEX	It's my good luck jacket. I'm not leaving without it.
CHARLIE	What is it with that jacket, Alex?
ALEX	It's special.
CHARLIE	It's falling apart, okay? You wear it every single day.
ALEX	It's my brother's, Charlie. He's deployed overseas. We don't get to hear from him. Half the time, we don't even know where he is. So as long as I'm wearing that jacket, I know he's safe. 
ALEX	I'm going.
CHARLIE	Alex... 
CHARLIE	Come on. Alex, wait up.
ALEX	What are you guys doing?
CHARLIE	We're in this together, remember? Friends till the end.
NICK	 Yeah.
ALEX	Don't sound so excited, Goggles.
NICK	Let's just get your jacket and get out of here.
CHARLIE	Do you remember where you left it?
ALEX	It should be right next to my sleeping bag, unless that thing got its claws on it.
CHARLIE	All quiet. Let's go.
ALEX	Hey, Charlie? Thanks for coming back for me.
NICK	Those things won't do you any good against a ghost.
CHARLIE	How do you know?
NICK & ALEX	Good point.
CHARLIE	How do you know?
NICK & ALEX	Good point.
ALEX	It's not here!
NICK	What do you mean, it's not here?  
CHARLIE	Are you sure this is where you left it?
ALEX	I'm sure.
NICK	Hurry up, guys! Come on, let's go!
CHARLIE	At least your flashlight still works.
NICK	It's not showing another rerun, is it?
CHARLIE	Man, I'd really like to know how that thing turned off and on all by itself.
NICK	Yeah, or where that fireball came from. And those eyes!
CHARLIE	Maybe we didn't find it all. Jake's stuff, I mean. Maybe there's still more.
NICK	Come on, Alex, hurry up! Let's go! 
ALEX	I'm not leaving here without my jacket.
CHARLIE	Then maybe we should just split up and take a room.
NICK	Have you ever actually seen a horror movie, Charlie? No way! I'm staying with you and that flashlight.
CHARLIE	Then come on!
NICK	Another ghost!
CHARLIE	Wait a second.
ALEX	You can open your eyes now, Rambo.
NICK	Oh.
ALEX	There it is!
ALEX	My jacket.
NICK	You sure you didn't drop it when we ran out of here?
ALEX	Yeah, I'm sure.
NICK	Then how did it get there?
CHARLIE	Guys, we walked right by here when we came back in. It wasn't there. We would've seen it.
ALEX	Maybe we just missed it.
NICK	Or maybe something put it there after we ran in, meaning whatever it is, it's still in the house with us. You got a better explanation? Come on, Charlie. Let's just get the heck out of this spooky old dump!
ALEX	I think you made the spooky old dump mad.
CHARLIE	Come on!
ALEX	Try one of the windows!
CHARLIE	I can't get it off.
CHARLIE	Look, just stay calm. They're trying to scare us again.
NICK	Yeah, well, they're doing a pretty good job of it.
CHARLIE	Just stay close and don't move! We'll be fine as long as we cover each other's backs!
ALEX	Charlie, you may want to reconsider that whole don't move thing.
ALEX	There are those eyes again!
NICK	My mom's gonna kill me!
ALEX	Come on! Let us out of here! I'll even give you my Cactus Jack knife if you want! Just leave us alone!
CHARLIE	Alex!
ALEX	Something's got my foot!
NICK	What is it?
ALEX	How should I know? Help me, Charlie! Do something!
ALEX	You guys? 
CHARLIE	Alex, can you hear me? Just hang on!
NICK	I told you we shouldn't have come back in here!
CHARLIE	Just help me, will ya?
NICK	In fact, we never even should've come here in the first place. This is all your fault, Charlie! I should be home right now eating Halloween candy till I puke! But no! You had to take that stupid dare!
CHARLIE	This is not the time, Nick! Alex is in trouble!
NICK	In case you haven't noticed, so are we!
ALEX	Charlie! You guys, help!
CHARLIE	Snap out of it! That thing out there's has our friend, and he needs our help! Now help me with the door.
NICK	This job definitely isn't worth . a year.  "Ghostbusters"?
CHARLIE	You are so weird.
ANGELA	Remind me again why we're doing this. 
BRANDY	So I can see the look on my brother's face when Charlie and his friends walk out of that house.
ANGELA	What makes you so sure they actually stayed the night? They're not exactly the bravest bunch of seventh graders I've ever seen.
BRANDY	Because I know Charlie. He's sweet, and he always sticks to his word. Be quiet. Don't wake up my parents.
CHARLIE	Alex? Can you hear me? Where are you?
CHARLIE	Oh!
NICK	Ohh! Holy smokes.
NICK	Charlie, check it out. The sun's finally up.
JAKE	Will you get back?
CARTER	You think they're still in there?
JAKE	Would you be?
CHARLIE	Alex, are you in there?
ALEX	Yeah, I'm in here. But you won't believe what I'm looking at.
NICK	Check, please.
NICK	Okay, new plan. We go home, forget this night ever happened and start looking for a new best friend.
NICK	Was that...
CHARLIE	Salty.
NICK 	The Sullivan Gang's dog? Didn't he rip people to shreds who crossed the gang?
CHARLIE	Shut up, Nick!
NICK	Well, that's what the story said!
CHARLIE	Alex, can you move?
ALEX	It won't let me!
CHARLIE	We gotta do something!
NICK	I got an idea! Uh... Ah!
NICK	Fetch, doggy!
NICK	Well, it was worth a try!
CHARLIE	We need a diversion. We need something that will give us enough time to get Alex out of there.
NICK	Uh, gimme a phone. I'll call in an airstrike.
CHARLIE	I got an idea!
TODD	Coffee...
NICK	I don't think I can do this, Charlie.
CHARLIE	Oh, whatever happened to "Rangers never retreat, tempting fate," and all that stuff?
NICK	Whatever happened to "live to see "? This has gotta be the dumbest thing I've ever done.
CHARLIE	No. It's the bravest. Come on.
ALEX	You guys!
NICK	Over here! 
CHARLIE	Are you okay?
ALEX	I think so.
NICK	Charlie! 
CHARLIE	Come on!
CHARLIE	Hey! Here!
CHARLIE	Get away from me!
CHARLIE S	it!
NICK	Charlie...
CHARLIE	Easy, boy.
NICK	It's not working, Charlie. 
CHARLIES	it! That's it. Good boy.
NICK	What's he doing?
ALEX	It's a dog. Dog needs a friend.
CHARLIE	Thataboy. 
ALEX	Awesome.
CHARLIE	See that? We didn't mean you any harm.
CHARLIE	Man's best friend, right?
ALEX	Let's just get our stuff and get out of here.
ALEX	Don't forget your Ranger knife, Goggles, just in case.
NICK	You think that thing was really a ghost?
CHARLIE	There's no such things as ghosts, remember?
CHARLIE	Besides, who'd believe us anyway?
NICK	This was the craziest adventure we've ever had.
ALEX	Yeah, and the coolest.
NICK	What are we gonna tell everybody at school?
CHARLIE	Nothing. It was a piece of cake. Hey, I got an idea. 
ALEX	No more bets, please.
CHARLIE	This will be even better. So we spread the word around that if we, the lowly geek squad, can spend the night in this place, then Jake and his friends shouldn't be afraid to do it either.
NICK	Yeah. I heard Jake's a dog person.
CHARLIE	Do you think it'll let us out?
ALEX 	Ohh...	Uh-oh, Charlie, it's your dad.
CHARLIE	Todd must've squealed.
NICK	What are you gonna tell him?
CHARLIE	The truth I guess. Well, most of it anyway. Time to face the music.
RUSS	Morning, fellas.
CHARLIE	Hey, Dad.
ALEX & NICK	Morning, Mr. Hamilton.
RUSS	So how was your study group last night?
CHARLIE	I'm really sorry. It's kind of a long story.
RUSS	I know. I heard the whole thing.
CHARLIE	Todd!
TODD	It wasn't me this time, I swear!
RUSS	For once, he's actually telling the truth. Your friend Brandy came over last night. She told me the whole story.
CHARLIE	She came to our house?
TODD	Yeah. Personally, I think she has a crush on me. But don't worry, Charlie. I'll let her down easy.
RUSS	Todd...
TODD	What? Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
RUSS	She's a nice girl, Charlie.
CHARLIE	I'm sorry that I lied to you, Dad. I'm sorry about the whole thing.
RUSS	I know. And you're grounded for lying, kiddo. And I'm sure you guyus are too, once your parents find out.
ALEX & NICK	Yes, Mr. Hamilton.
RUSS	But I'm proud of you too.
CHARLIE	Thanks, Dad.
RUSS	You boys must've had quite an experience in there last night, huh?
CHARLIE	Nothing we couldn't handle.
RUSS	All right, let's go, boys. Let's get you home. Come on.
CHARLIE	Hey, uh, do you mind if we walk? I'll come straight home, I promise.
RUSS	All right, but straight home. All right? Let's go.
TODD	Sorry, bro. 
CHARLIE	Wow. I must be hearing things.
TODD	We can discuss the matter of my $ later.
RUSS	Todd. Van. Now!
RUSS	Oh, yeah, and, if your Mom asks, you tell her I got real angry, and I couldn't stop yelling, just like I always do, all right?
CHARLIE	It's our secret, Dad.
RUSS	All right.
TODD	You know, since you're in such a forgiving mood, Russ, there's this letter that got sent home with me from school that I've been meaning to talk to you about.
RUSS	Todd?
TODD	Yeah?
RUSS	Shut up.
ALEX	Wow. Your dad's full of surprises.
CHARLIE	Yeah. Seems to be the night for it.
BRANDY	Hi, Charlie.
CHARLIE	Hey, what are you guys doing here?
ANGELA	She's waiting for you, stupid.
BRANDY	I told your dad. I'm so sorry.
CHARLIE	It's okay. He was actually kind of cool about it.
BRANDY	I was just worried.
CHARLIE	About me? No, I mean, about us. I mean, you were...
BRANDY	Well, I was, um... I mean...
ANGELA	This is so stupid. Look, you like her, she likes you. Just say it already.
BRANDY	Angela!
ANGELA	You're the one they always call "Goggles," right?
NICK	Yeah.
ANGELA	You're actually kind of cute without your glasses.
JAKE	Hey, Brainiac!
CHARLIE	I never said I couldn't catch a football. You did.
JAKE	So you guys actually stuck it out, huh?
NICK	Yeah. That was the bet, right?
CHARLIE	And it's Charlie. Not Brainiac or dork or geek boy. 
ALEX	Yeah.
JAKE	Shut up, Brent. I'll remember that.
JAKE	Come on, guys. See you around, Charlie.
NICK	I can't believe it. He actually seemed...
ALEX	Nice.
NICK	I was gonna say magnanimous, but then I thought they might hear me and come back and do that hitting us on every syllable thing again.
CHARLIE	Let's just go home.
 BRANDY	Who's this?
CHARLIE	I don't know.
BRANDY	Does he have a tag? What's his name?
CHARLIE	I don't see one.
NICK	How about Salty?
BRANDY	He sure acts like he knows you, Charlie. Oh, he's so cute. What a good boy.
ANGELA	Can we go home now, please?
BRANDY	Does he have a tag? What's his name?
CHARLIE	I don't see one.

NICK	How about Salty?
BRANDY	He sure acts like he knows you, Charlie. 	Oh, he's so cute. What a good boy.
ANGELA	Can we go home now, please?
CHARLIE	Come on, boy.
ALEX	Thanks for coming back for me.
NICK	Heh heh. Uh, Charlie sorta made me do it.
ALEX	Boy, when that old TV came on by itself... or that fireball...
NICK	Man, that was the ugliest ghost I've ever seen.
ALEX	Dude, that was the only ghost you've ever seen.
BRANDY	What are they talking about?
CHARLIE	Just an old ghost story.
BRANDY	What did he mean when he said, "Thanks for coming back for me?" Tell me, Charlie.Really, did something happen in that house last night? 
CHARLIE	Yeah. I learned who my real friends are.
CHARLIE	And I don't care what Jake or any of his friends or anyone else says.I'm Charlie Hamilton, and I like math and science and D&D and old monster movies, and I think that's pretty cool.
BRANDY	So do I.
BRANDY	Well, anyway, it must have been pretty exciting. Are you gonna keep him?
CHARLIE	Sure...unless someone else comes to get him.
