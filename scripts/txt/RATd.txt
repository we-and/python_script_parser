RATD ADAPTATION 16 MAI 2021

01:00:31
Even today, planet Earth can fill us  
with wonder and mystery.   

01:00:37
The music and dance 
of waves hitting a beach
can make us feel intimately connected 
to the magnificent power of nature.  

01:00:48
The ephemeral crash of a wave against a cliff 
can provoke thoughts of eternity,
in ways stronger than any words
or philosophical books.  

01:00:56 
Everything and everyone is connected.

01:00:58 
And about 60 percent of our bodies 
are composed of water.

01:01:03
And scientists say most elements that make up the human body were formed in stars.

01:01:08
Like our sun.

01:01:08
So we are filled with the stuff of light. And with water! 

01:01:13 
My name is Gordon Wilson.	   (IN)

01:01:19 
For as long as I can remember,
I have loved the fish of the sea
and the birds of the air 
and every creeping thing that
lives on this Earth.

01:01:28 
That love has led me
into science,

into teaching and writing,
into exploring and learning,
chasing and catching.

01:01:45 
This amazing planet has so much diversity.

01:01:48 
From the herb yielding seed,
to the fruit tree yielding fruit
how incredible Nature is!

01:01:56 
I am a creature among creatures.

01:01:58 
Like you, I am a part of nature.
Made from the stuff of stars. 

01:02:04 
Our planet gives us life.  It is part of a system.

01:02:07
Each living organism that moves
on our planet, by day or night
is a part of our ecosystem.

01:02:15 
We have a role to play. 
From the beasts in the field
to the birds in the air
and the fish in the sea,
we have a responsibility towards every creature

01:02:21 
to tend them, to know them, to name them.

01:02:25 
If we don’t cherish our ecosystem,
this amazing diversity of wildlife,
Nature—and humanity itself
will confront a broken world
yearning for restoration.

01:02:39 
I am a teacher, a writer,
but first, I am a part of this amazing
ecosystem.  This dance.

01:02:47 
And this...is my celebration
of the world
we all live in,
this world of Riot...
and of Dance.

01:03:40
Gordon, you'll never be able
to call yourself a biologist
if you continue to hold the
views about evolution
that you demonstrated
last week.
You're a bright person—
start using your own mind!

01:03:53 
Marc

(laughter IN)

01:03:59 
That's a little note I received
in graduate school
many years ago.

01:04:03 
I keep it hanging in my office
to remind me
of the diverse views scientists have.

01:04:08  (IN)
Of course I'm a biologist.
I study life, and that’s
what biology means.

01:04:14 (IN)
But in other ways it’s the least
important part of me.

01:04:18 (IN)
First, I’m a human animal,

01:04:20 
I’m the son of two,
the husband of one.
I’m the father of five,
the grandfather of seven,
brother of three,

01:04:34 (IN)
and I’m the uncle of
scads...dozens.

01:04:38  (IN)
But in some ways, I’m not
a biologist at all,

01:04:43 (IN)
at least in the secular sense.

01:04:45, (IN)
These days, a biologist is
supposed to focus on
naturalistic causes exclusively.

01:04:49, (IN)
The living creation.

01:04:51, (IN)
They are not only paintings,
they are sculptures.

01:4:53 (IN)
And they’re sculptures that
are living and breathing,

01:04:57, (IN)
and they can reproduce,
and they can interact.

01:05:01: (IN)
I want to show you just a
fraction of what's out there.

01:05:04. (IN)
Like a hobbit, I’m gonna take
you out my front door  
and then farther and farther
away until we’ve reached
the other side of this globe
and faced a serpent or two,
or three, or four...five.

01:05:23 
This fragile, rich ecosystem is not just
something to be studied in classrooms or
on onion skin pages of old books.

01:05:32, 
It’s living and breathing
in the mountains,
the deserts, and the trees.

01:05:37 
Nature glories in its beauty,

and so should we.

01:05:44
If you want to glimpse the
majestic masterpieces
of this wonderful planet,
you don't even need to leave
your corner of this
living gallery in which we
all exist.

01:05:54
Just stand...

01:05:56
and breathe...
and open your eyes right
where you are.
In your own place.

01:06:07 
Wonder is waiting for you
just outside your door.

01:06:10
Call it photosynthesis if
you want
but these trees were crafted
from thin air
by the light (power) of our
nearest star.

01:06:18
Water that has flown above
the globe
in cloudy continents,
that has fallen and risen
and fallen again
since the world was
newborn,
quenching the thirst of
ferns and men,

01:06:29
carving canyons, kissing
flowers, hatching insects.

01:06:35
If you yearn to travel,
hungering to see

distant lands and exotic
beasts...
first see the things all
around you
that you have never seen
before.

01:06:45
See them truly.
As gifts. As miracles.

01:06:50
When you have been amazed
by the mundane,
then you are ready to
wander and explore.

01:07:03
This is my place.
The temperate conifer forests of
the Pacific Northwest

01:07:09
As simple as the life may seem,
my wonder starts here...
with a squirrel.

01:07:16 
Doing work.

01:07:22 
The red squirrel. Birth length:
one inch.
Full grown: one foot.
Job: jumping, yelling,
shucking pinecones,
and planting forests with
hundreds of buried and
forgotten seeds.

01:07:50 
Here we have a solar
powered barbecue.

01:07:53
A family of ants.
A slow-cooked earthworm.
And a squadron of massive,
carnivorous,
scavenging monsters in
matching jackets.
Black and yellow jackets.

01:08:06
Hairy and armored.
Deadly.

01:08:12
But ants are harder to
frighten than people.

01:08:16
The next time a yellow jacket
settles on your plate,
imagine if it was twenty
times your size.

01:08:22
Now imagine being brave
enough
to bite it on the head.
Or grab onto its belly, barely
out of stingers’ reach.

01:08:30 
Look near. Look small.
See what you can find.
And marvel.

01:08:37 
Go to the ant. Sluggards.

01:08:47 
My favorite mountain pond.

01:08:49 
Heavy and still, a mirror
in the trees.

01:08:55 
Before setting out for
distant places,
I decided to check in on this
old friend one more time.

01:09:02 
Surely, you have a pond nearby.
And no doubt it is more
crowded with life
than any zoo.

01:09:10 
When cool pond water presses
in around my legs
and the insects scatter,
I am never bored.
To be bored in this world, is to
be boring in this world. 

01:09:23 
This is probably one of the
highest densities      (IN)
of water striders I’ve
ever seen.

01:9:35
When it catches prey, the
water strider
uses its sharp straw-like beak
to slurp up its food.

01:09:41 
Can you walk on water?

01:09:44 
He can.

01:09:46 
Every good pond has a nice
fat frog.

01:09:57
This one is a Columbia spotted.

01:10:01 
Just a frog right?
Well, try inventing one
from nothing.
And make sure to include the
strangeness of tadpoles.

01:10:11 
These guys hibernate,
surviving winters
as far north as Alaska.
 
01:10:17
They also aestivate, which means
they can go dry and dormant
during high heat or drought,
reviving with the rain.

01:10:29    (IN)
Oh, beautiful!

01:10:32 
The garter snake.
Possibly the most common snake
in North America,
which means they can make
nature buffs yawn.

01:10:41 
But snowflakes are far more
common
and each one is still a marvel.

01:10:47 
And just like snowflakes, these
snakes can pile up in drifts.

01:10:51 
In Manitoba, Canada, tens of
thousands
of red-sided garter snakes
winter together
in massive den colonies.

01:11:02
Most people have strong feelings
about snakes.

01:11:05 
But how should we feel
about them?

01:11:08 
We’ll have that conversation
later.
When the snakes are scarier.

01:11:14 
For now, like all snakes, this
one is stuck 
crawling on his belly in the
dust and the mud. 
Eating frogs and insects and
poisonous newts.
Gliding across the water.

01:12:10 
Nature seems to work with motifs.
Where Nature’s geological
architecture is grandest,
the beasts often match.

01:12:20 
Big beasts in thick coats can
survive mountainous
Montana winters, sixty degrees
below zero.

01:12:28 
Granite and ice crack
in the spring,
while antlers are shed and
regrown every year. 

01:12:35 
In this corner of the global
garden, it is all one song.
One play.
Man has given names to all of 
these animals.

And here he has earned
a gold star.

01:12:49
Pronghorn. Not an antelope.
Faster than any other animal
on the continent,
they can hit top speeds of
55 miles per hour.

01:13:01 
The Moose. The tallest animal in
the western hemisphere. 
Six and a half feet
at the shoulder.

01:13:09 
Would any other name
suit that nose? 

01:13:13 
And buffalo. Bison
if you prefer. 
1400 pounds of western nobility
and comedy
combined under a big woolly rug.

01:13:27 
Bighorn sheep.
It isn’t hard to see how these
warriors earned their name.

01:13:51 
Elk, occasionally regal,
occasionally goofy.

01:13:58 
This bull elk has already
shed his antlers
and is just beginning to
sprout new ones.
The antlers are bone, which
can grow as much as
one inch per day
in the spring.
I can’t even imagine the head
and neck aches 
that must come from
growing up to
forty pounds of bone
out of your skull.

01:14:18 
I feel your pain big guy.

01:14:21
A mother moose will only keep
a male calf with her
for around 18 months before she
drives him away to mate again.
But a female calf like
this one
might stay near her mother
for years.
In the summer, these
two together
will eat well over 100 lbs
of food a day.
But a long hard winter
is their friend.

01:14:41 
It’s the only thing that might
get rid of the ticks.

01:14:45
Believe it or not, an
adult moose
can get stuck carrying more than
seventy-five thousand ticks.

01:14:51
And to animals this size,
disease is a more dangerous
enemy than bears or wolves.

01:14:59
Bison used to cover this
continent,
ranging from Alaska
to Mexico.

Now only fifteen thousand
are generally considered
to be wild and free range.
And because they can interbreed
with cattle,
even fewer are genetically pure.

01:15:15 
These buffs, ranging in Wyoming,   (bulls?)
near the Montana border,
are some of the few without any
mooing domesticated ancestors.

 
01:15:51 
Spin the globe and move west.
Out of the mountains and into
the Pacific rains.
Where trees have grown up into
wooden towers, older than
the modern world.

01:16:05 
If Redwoods live over two thousand years
can’t we spare the time to
give them a glance?

01:16:13 
The largest of these coast
Redwoods use

more than a billion needles
to stay healthy.
Which shouldn’t surprise us,
because the dry mass
of one of these trees—pretending
we could remove all the moisture
from the wood—is still well
over four hundred tons.
And that mass is gathered
from thin air,
by those needles, powered
by starlight.

01:16:44 
And from here…skootch off
the edge of the continent
and down the cliffs.

01:17:01,
Altitude: zero feet above
sea level.

256
01:17:10 
Few animals have a higher
cuteness quotient
than the harbor seals.

01:17:15 
With the broadest global
distribution of any seal,

they are like the permanent
puppies of the shallows.
This pod has chosen a sandy spit
in central Oregon.
They are earless, but with a
clearly visible ear canal
that gets the job done,
and their nostrils form
a distinctive V.
Swimming and diving from birth,
they are short, soft,
and playful,
although adults can grow
longer than six feet
and weigh almost three
hundred pounds

01:17:48 
The world may be a dangerous place,
and yes, there are hungry sharks
and killer whales
in the deep water, eager
to snack
on fat furry dumplings.
But these seals live happily,
sheltering on sandy beaches
in shallow river mouths,
where their biggest problem is
something we can all relate to.

01:18:08 
They itch.

01:19:24 
Not all seals are so carefree.

01:19:30 
Though these creatures seem to be enjoying a little sand bath
basking in the light of the sun.

01:19:39
They don’t seem too busy right now.

01:19:42 
Many people now believe
that whatever
we might come across in nature
holds a place in our ecosystem.

01:19:53 
But nature is not always kind.  

01:20:00
Step onto a California beach
crowded with elephant seals
and you are stepping onto a
beach teaming with cruel life.

Groaning everywhere.

01:20:24
Half ton mothers accidentally
crush their young
and leave their bodies
to feed the seagulls.
Orphaned pups are bitten
and chewed to death
wherever they turn for help.

01:20:43
Five thousand pound bulls
dominate
smaller screaming females,
and sneak attack the harems
of others.

01:20:50 
Bachelors are banished to their
own beach
until they are big enough to
drive off another bull
and steal his many
captive wives.

01:21:00 
In South America, the bulls grow
even larger,
weighing upwards of 9000lbs—
that’s more than five bull
bison, or ten grizzly bears.
Yes, they jiggle.
Yes, their bubbly noses fall
into their mouths.
Yes, they look like critters from
Star Wars.
Yes, they are powerful
and amazing.

01:21:25 
What a spectacle they offer us!
They are large, almost comic.

01:21:32
It is more Riot than
it is Dance,

01:21:35
and it is probably not the most refined, immaculate
image of nature.

01:23:00
I want people to see that
Life is not a basket of kittens,
okay?
If I want to usher people. (IN)
into the glories
and wonders of nature and (creation)
you say,
“Well, there’s all this death
and predator-prey relationship
and parasite-hosts.”

01:23:15
Yeah, all of those things are a      (OUT)
part of nature.

01:23:21
But man sometimes damages nature’s fragile balance
(IN) so we know that it’s broken
But even in the midst of the      (OUT)
death of one of nature’s creations
the glories of nature are still
very, very present.
Man must redeem his role on this planet. 
We need redemption.

01:23:41 (IN)
The creation needs redemption.
People need redemption.

01:23:46
We shouldn’t run away from it. (OUT)
We have responsibility
over our entire planet. Our dominion.

01:23:53
We have to take that charge.  (IN)
very seriously.
And in order to take dominion
we have to know 
who our charges are,
what they eat,    (OUT)
how they live,
what are their habitat
requirements?
You can't just be ignorant
of all of these creatures
and be good stewards.

01:24:21
Many people say there is no
objective beauty in the world.

01:24:26
Those people are tragically
blind.

01:24:30
Meet the Sonoran Desert.
it’s almost twice the size of
New York state
and is filled with some of
the most
unique habitats in the world.
I’ve wanted to scour it for as
long as I can remember.

01:24:44
Especially with a camera crew.

01:24:46
Every good desert is full of
fangs of every kind.

01:24:50
And so a lot of people think
of it as
a very inhospitable place.

01:24:54
It may be for you. But for
a lot of creatures—
graced with the right equipment
and lifestyles—
this is a great place to live.

01:25:03 
Even without air conditioning.
See glorious artistry in the
mountains,
in the prickly pears.

01:25:20
Look a puma in the face.
Really look.

01:25:27, 
We can cherish its symmetry and grace
like a work of art.

01:25:34 
How lucky we are to share the dance of life on this planet
with such beautiful and wild creatures.

01:26:14
Watch the desert wolves wander.

01:26:25
Stretch and yawn with the
coyotes in the desert dawn.
How much of the magic
and wonder of this world is there for us to enjoy?

01:26:35
How much should we treasure and preserve?

01:26:37
The answer is the same.
All of it.
Every prickle and every pebble.
Every storm, every breeze.
Every insect and every lizard.

01:26:52
From small to big, we must try to preserve it all. 

01:27:28
One of the best ways to
catch a lizard
is with a copper wire noose
on a stick.

01:27:34
I use a partial fishing pole.

01:27:42
We just caught a Clark’s
spiny lizard.
It’s in the fence lizard family.
This is a male and it has dark
patches
on the sides of the neck. 
A nice blue throat patch.

Also some turquoise on the belly
and on the sides of the tail.

01:27:58,080 
Why? Because it’s pretty.
Like a very speedy reptilian
flower.
Every scale is delicately keeled
like a ship.
Or an aspen leaf with
turquoise flecking.
If you zoom in at the eye
you can see
very lovely and intricate
sculpturing.

01:28:31
We caught a zebra-tailed
lizard.
which is arguably the fastest
lizard in the United States.

It is also, I think, . (IN)
one of the most handsome lizards.

01:28:44
It’s a sand Lizard and has a
shovel nose face
that’s useful for burrowing.
This male also has beautiful
turquoise
and salmon colors.
And of course, it has zebra
striping on the tail,
which it loves to raise and
fly like a banner
when it’s not in a hurry.

01:29:06
The Sonoran Desert is the
hottest in all of Mexico.
But when you get into the
hills and the mountains,
it is lush and green,
and even the monsoon
puddles
are teeming with strange life.

01:29:29
This is a giant water bug.
It is a very effective
underwater predator
It's got predatory forelegs
It has a dagger-like beak
which it uses
to pierce its prey and pump
digestive enzymes,
liquefying its prey, and then  (IN 29:44)
sucking up  (OUT)
the predigested fluid.

01:29:48
If you were a tiny critter
sharing its puddle,
no science fiction author could
make up something
more frightening.

01:29:57
When it comes to dragonflies,
I think Nature is showing off. 

In a wonderful way.

I love them,

01:30:04. 
although not enough to jump into this water!

01:30:07
Here a mother lays eggs in water,    
one at a time.

01:30:15
Aquatic turtles in the desert?
Why not?

01:30:20
Even here nature provides for these
clunky little guys.

01:30: 31:
I wanted to visit the Santa Rita
mountains in southern Arizona.

01:30:40
This is a nice shady ravine.
Perfect habitat for a Sonoran
mountain kingsnake.

01:30:50
This beautiful snake is called
the Sonoran mountain kingsnake.
Also called the Knobloch’s
mountain king.

01:30:57
Its bright coloration you
would think

01:31:00
would be not very good.      (IN)
camouflage,
but when it's in the dappled
leaf litter,

01:31:03   (OUT)
it blends in very well.

01:31:09
While most King Snakes eat a lot
of snakes—even rattlesnakes.
This one mostly makes do
with lizards.

01:31:23
We just caught a Yarrow  (IN)
spiny lizard.

01:31:28
One thing that's characteristic. (OUT)
about these lizards.  (IN)
is they have a fishnet stocking
pattern down the body.   (OUT)
If you look up close around
this guy’s head,
you can see orange mites
embedded around his eyes
and on the sides of his neck.
It’s a hard life out there.
Poor guy must itch.

01:31:48
Sometimes you can lull them
to sleep with a belly rub.
Forget your troubles
little buddy.
Are you grumpy? No?

01:31:55
Apparently, you’ve made friends
with me

01:32:27
Well, I think I’ll let you go.

01:32:00 
Steer clear of the kingsnakes.

01:32:04
This is a juvenile. You can see
his colors are still more drab.
And he’s got his own bad case
of mites.
Not sure what they could do
about that.
Life is tough all over.

01:32:20
This little guy is an
ornate tree lizard.
Up close, it has a variety of
autumnal hues.

01:32:28
It also has larger scaling on
its backbone.

01:32:41
Scurry on, friend. Find some
tasty beetles
and avoid the mites.

01:33:02
Oh yes, please!

01:33:05
This snake is called
a coachwhip.
Colors vary, including
everything from dusty pink
to blood red.
Head like a sportscar.
10 miles per hour might
not seem fast to you,
but it is when you don’t
have any legs.
That land speed makes
this guy one of
one of the very fastest serpents
in the western hemisphere.

01:33:29
And one of the grumpiest.

01:33:36
But chewing on my knuckle
won’t do him any good.
These snakes are not venomous.
They will bite to defend themselves. 

01:33:57
Some animals hold a special
place in just about every heart.
Who doesn’t love watching
hummingbirds hum?
Or sit?
Or stick out their long tongues
and sip nectar?

01:34:18
All 300 species of hummingbird
live in the west,
ranging from Alaska to Chile.
Hummingbirds are the only birds 
that can fly backwards!
Do you know that the average 
hummingbird
weighs less than some coins?

01:34:36
Have you watched one in slow motion,
with wings beating 70 times
per second?

01:34:42
Slow motion is the only way
to get a real look.

01:34:49
With hearts pumping 1200
times per minute,
one wonders if time itself
is different
for these territorial
little fighters.

01:34:58
The very smallest—the bee
hummingbird in Cuba—
weighs only seven hundredths
of an ounce.
The largest—the Patagonia
hummingbird
in South America—is still
only seven tenths of an ounce.

01:35:31
Fabergé made around
50 beautiful but lifeless eggs, valued
at many, many millions.

01:35:40
How many of these miraculous
birds exist?

01:35:45
Hatched from how many
tiny, hidden,
divinely crafted pencil
eraser sized eggs?

01:36:08
Darkness draws a veil on one
world but reveals another.
Especially after rain.

01:36:18
Very heavy downpour this
afternoon.
I’m sure it brought the
toads out.

01:36:25.  (IN?)
Here we have a red-spotted
toad.

01:36:28. 
He just peed on me.

01:36:30
This little guy is aptly named.  (IN)
because each wart is accented. (OUT)
with a little splotch of red.
They're out and about, running
around looking for insects

01:36:43
These warts, all over the toad’s
skin are poison glands.
Especially, these two big lumps
right behind the eyes
called parotid glands.   (timing avec les mains)
Any predator who tries to eat
a toad will be in for
an extremely foul surprise.

01:36:59
How could an amphibian which
needs constantly moist skin
live in the desert?
Well, they have these handy
little pelvic patches.   (avec les mains/crapaud)
You can see the darker
pigmentation.
That’s why they’re out
after the rain.
They press those patches up
against any damp surface
and absorb moisture right up
out of the earth,
keeping themselves as slick and
slimy as they need to be.

01:37:22
They’re very spunky.
I’m petting his belly to try
to mesmerize him.

01:37:28
Nope. He's got places to be.
Be off, little one.

01:37:43
The toads aren’t the only
poisonous beasties
out and about after
this storm.

01:37:50
Porcupines won’t really fling
quills at you. But tarantulas will.

01:37:58
Each of those abdomen hairs
is a fling-able barb.
If you’re going to mess with
one of these ladies,
watch your eyes.

01:38:13
Bark scorpions can’t hide
from a black light.

They might be small,
But they still can kill you
with that sting.
Or just give you the worst
72 hour flu of your life.
These tender mothers deliver
their young live,
and they carry their brood
on their backs.

01:38: 39
This is called a sun spider.
Which is ironic because
it hates light,
especially sunlight.
Scientists don’t really know
what to do with it.
It’s not a scorpion,
not a spider, not an insect.

01:38:54
It’s an amazing hunter
with massive jaws
that can account for up to
a third of its six-inch body length,
making it strong enough
to take down lizards.
In fact, measured in pounds
per square inch,
some folks believe these
lovelies
have some of the strongest jaws
in the Animal Kingdom.

01:39:13
Whether it’s running, hunting,
or eating,
 it only goes full speed.

01:39:19
Science fiction authors,
call your office.

01:39:23
Woah! 

01:39:24
UNE AUTRE VOIX      NECESSAIRE?
Is that a snake?

01:39;26 
Goodness! Look at that thing!  ?  (C’est qui? ). NECESSAIRE?

01:39:29,
I’ve never, ever seen
a threadsnake.
This is just amazing.

01:39:41
Tiny. Blind. 
Tracks ants
by scent.
Small enough to invade
anthills and feast.

01:39:50
Small or large, Nature’s creativity
never dwindles.

01:40:01. (EN LIVE MAIS ON NE VOIT PAS LE VISAGE)
Sonoran desert toad.
What a beautiful animal.
He's beefy!

01:40:10
Desert toads also come
in jumbo sizes.
The slime all over my hands
right now
is actually quite dangerous.
Toxic stuff.
Hallucinogenic even in
trace doses.

01:40:25
And they're slippery!

01:40:33
He’s got some big kidney
bean size parotid glands.

01:40:36:22 
Beautiful gold eyes.

01:41:40:
Princesses can kiss frogs
all they like,
but don’t go kissing a toad.

01:40:48
I think I’m done with all
these toxic secretions.
And I think he’s done
with me.

01:41:03
But there are worse poisons.

01:41:13
This is an adult sidewinder.
If he wasn’t scary enough
looking already,
the horned scales above his
eyes make him
even look more villainous.

01:41:24
Not a particularly big
rattlesnake,
but a pretty one.
We disturbed him while
he was flattening
his wide body against the dirt
road to suck up heat.
These guys are pit vipers.

Which means, first
and foremost,
that they have infrared
sensing pits between the eyes and
the nostrils.

01:41:42
Those pits provide thermal
imaging—night vision.
They also have hollow
syringe-like front fangs
which fold back into their
mouths when closed,
and swing down to deliver venom
when the mouth opens to strike.

01:41:55
The word viper may derive from
a pairing of the Latin words, “vivus”
and “parere”, the words for living and
to beget
as many vipers give live birth.
With a viper’s musculature and
defensive posture, a strike is more like a
lightning-quick, quick fanged punch
than a slap.

01:42:16
How are humans supposed to
view deadly vipers?
Especially vipers like this one
with such amazing engineering
and striking design—
from the horns to the pits
to the swinging fangs
and keeled scales and rattling
tail and looping gait?

01:42:33
We can marvel at the motion
of serpents like this one.

01:42:37
Is that all we’re supposed to do?
Marvel?

01:42:42
Many people will kill them
on sight,
even if they aren’t a threat.

01:42:46
Is that what we should do?
Exterminate them?

01:42:49,
As human animals who wish to 
defend our homes and families,
what are we supposed to do
with the deadly serpents and
other animals that
seem like they would have
no place in a modern world? 

01:43:06
About as far away from
my own little home
as I can possibly get,
sitting in the sapphire sea
south of India,
you will find the beautiful
island nation of Sri Lanka
and her many diverse and
tropical ecosystems—

01:43:20
Arid lowlands, lush jungles,
dense rain forests,
and even high elevation
cloud forests.

01:43:29
In Sri Lanka, even the mundane
is exotic to my American eyes,
but the same overarching primal objectives
are just as obvious here
as it is in my familiar ponds
back home.

01:43:50
Nature loves the color green.
Nature loves working with feathers
and scales and creeping things.

01:44:03
Still, this is a wing in our ecosystem’s
living art museum that I have never visited before,
and I want to see…everything, no matter how impossible that
might be.

01:44:29
You want to talk about
birds? (alternative: mundane)
In an island with more than
400 species of birds, filled with exotic blue
magpies
and serpent eagles and
wild peacocks
and athletic hornbills
and kingfishers
and storks and egrets,
the national bird is a
wild chicken.

01:44:51
The brightly colored and
resilient jungle fowl.

01:44:56  
Amazing, yes, but so…normal.

01:45:02
It’s all about perspective,
isn’t it?

01:44:46
My own favorite?
The determined and diligent
weaver birds.
Instead of finding a solid fork
in a thick branch
to hold their young, each pair
of these weavers
chooses a single swinging twig
as a foundation
for a new home—often in
one colonial tree.
And then they begin to weave
their dangling basket nests—
the most elaborately constructed
nests in the world.

01:46:14 
In Africa, hundreds of social
weaver pairs will even build massive
collective nests together
like apartment buildings
or tree top haystacks.

01:46:23
Those jumbo nests can be
used by their descendants
for more than a century.

01:46:31
What gave these birds
such desire?
Such faith? Such ability?
One can imagine some product designer 
telling her assistant:
Let’s grow the long grass
for the weaverbirds
and teach them to twist
and knot and tie
Then we’ll send the breeze to
swing their nests
and rock their young to sleep
at night.

01:47:15
Other birds, like the crested
serpent eagle, are far more princely.
And frightening to creeping things.

01:47:57
But this crested serpent-eagle
isn’t intimidating at all
to smaller territorial birds
intent on
messing up his feathered crown.
Especially when he’s so intently
focused on the ground

01:48:11 
The Land Monitor is a beefy
opponent in its own right,
growing up to five feet long
and weighing
over twenty pounds.
As they are armed with
vicious claws,
unrelenting jaws and a powerful
whipping tail,
I decided against grabbing
even a smaller one.

01:48:43 
This hawk-eagle definitely
should have
given it more thought—
With a maximum weight
of around 4 lbs, the bird is definitely
out of its weight class with
this dense lizard.

01:48:54
Even with talons buried
deep in its sides,
the victim monitor whips
and bites and fights
for more than an hour
while peahens scream
in panic all around.
Are they rooting for their
fellow bird,
or for the lizard?

01:49:11
We couldn’t say.

01:49:12
But they find the fight
disturbing. As they should.

01:49:50
Finally, this exhausted bird
can eat.

01:50:01
Another reptile killer.
A mongoose.
Made internationally famous
by Rudyard Kipling
and his tale of
Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,
I’ve wanted to meet one
since boyhood.
Beloved for their willingness
to take on even massive cobras, this one is focused on a
lizard snack.

01:50;23
As most of them are.

01:50;37
The Water Buffalo.

01:50:39
Wild, these are now quite rare.
Endangered since the 80s,
less than a thousand
remain worldwide.

01:50:50 
Smaller domesticated versions
exist throughout Asia.

01:50:54
If you had to weigh a ton
and live in the tropical heat, you’d love
basking in the mud too.

01:51:02 
Watch where you wade.
It’s not just the crocs
and snakes
you have to worry
about here.

01:51;07
There could be a whole
buffalo down there.

01:51;11
As beautiful as this world is,
the violence of nature is everywhere,
providing us glimpses of the necessities
for survival.

01:51:21
Crows and Jackals and even
a beautiful, white-bellied sea eagle all
wait their turns while a Warthog disembowels
a dead buffalo.

01:52:12
When there’s a kill, the hungry come running.

01:52:17
All species share the pangs of hunger 
and will one day feel death.

01:52:27
But beauty is visible here, too.

01:52:34
Grace.

01:52:36
Strength.

01:52:38
Loveliness.

01:52:55
The rare Ceylon
spotted deer—
found only in the dry forests
of Sri Lanka—
moving through dappled light.

01:53:06 
A lone wading elephant feeding
on water lilies
in front of a rock with the
same shape.

01:53:19
These creatures almost belong
in fairy tales.
Could any of us have made
them up?

01:53:25
Massive and ponderous. Living
between 40 and 70 years,
they are loyal to their friends
and family until death.
Their ability to grieve is
unique among animals.
They gather together and mourn
the loss of a single member of a herd—
even performing burials with
leaves and branches,
and revisiting death sites
years later.
They have even been known
to travel many miles
to gather and mourn the
death of a human friend—
somehow aware of the loss
over distance.

01:53:58
All elephants are tusked in
Africa—both male and female.
Only some of the males are
tusked in Asia.

01:54:08
Gifted with long dexterous noses
to use as both straws and arms,
enabling them to reach the
ground—
slurping water or
picking grass.

01:54:21 
Wrinkled, bristly, and baggy,

01:54:25
only Nature could take so
much comedy—
wrinkled skin, saggy legs,
bulging bellies,
giant flapping ears, small eyes,
long swinging noses
and waddling backsides—
and assemble them
into creatures
who seem so…noble.

01:55:18
Other creatures remain
entirely comic,
if we don’t pay too much
mind to their mischief.
The Hanuman langur is
a leaf eater.

01:55:27
Named after a Hindu 
Monkey god,

01:55:33
they are just as badly behaved
as elephant seals.

01:55:40
In a troop this size, every
infant shares a sire.
And should a new dominant
male take over,
he will attempt to kill
every nursing baby
so that he can replace
them all with new ones of his own.

01:56:44
But the langurs are quick.

01:57:21,
This stunning leopard will hunt
elsewhere tonight.

01:57:39 
When we study nature’s many,
many works, one of the first things that
should become apparent
is that nature’s taste is often
nothing like ours.

01:57:51
Sure, we love sunsets.
We love swaying forests and
ancient sprawling trees.
We love calm water reflecting
the sky.
We love bunny rabbits and
harbor seals.

01:58:04
But what about things
like…bats?

01:58:06
Giant bats. Flying foxes.
Gathered in city-sized colonies
thousands strong.

01:58:14
Orange and fluffy in the center
of black four-foot wingspans with
long finger claws.
Upside-down fruit eaters.
Even though they can fly at
3 months old,
mothers nurse their pups
until 5 months.

01:58:30
Full adulthood comes
around 18 months.
How can we appreciate such 
creatures?
Should we take pleasure in
their squalling?

01:58:41
Maybe we should.
At least if they aren’t
stripping some poor farmer’s
banana groves.

01:58:47
Why would anyone ever dare
to proclaim their hatred
of any part of Nature’s wonders? 
Even this creature, so different from us.
with its magnificent, leathery wings.

01:58:59
We are often quick to express hatred
for nature’s creative works
living all around us.
The living and breathing art of our planet.

01:59:08
Humanity should always
be striving to work in harmony with our ecosystem—
embracing this magic, diverse wildlife.

01:59:15
We know our environment
includes a great deal more-
not just fruit bats,
but our fellow men
and women too.

01:59:27
Everything that exists is here
because of Nature’s gracious and creative
affection.
And we must act to preserve it
before it’s too late.

01:59:37
We must even respect those creatures and
people that seem so different from us.

01:59:41
After all, everything here is
groaning against death,
because we are all mortal.

02:00:01
The rainforests and jungles
are filled with many familiar faces—
and many foreign. 

02:00:44
Who could have thought up this
giant millipede with 500 legs like piano keys?
It does a great job of eating
the rotting leaves
on the jungle floor

02:00:51
Is it and all its kind, part of
our inheritance?

02:00:54
Yes, it is, and I love it.

02:01:03
Bees of every kind?

02:01:05
Oh, yes.

02:01:07
They have much to teach
and give us
in their diligence.

02:01:34
Do we see creative artistry
in spiders? We should.

02:01:55
This is a green garden		(IN)
lizard.     (OUT)

834
02:01:58
A plain name for such
a beauty.
They like to hang out in low
jungle shrubs and trees,
feeding on insects.

02:02:06
Beautiful long tail.   (IN). (OUT)

02:02:09
The keeled emerald scales
on the baggy throat— called a dewlap, are
more beautiful than any ancient emperor’s
armor.   And the intricate scalation
around the eyes is gorgeous.
A lovely spiny crest that
runs down the back
to the hipbone.
Hold a lizard too loose
and it might get away,
but too tight and you
might be damaging
some interior organs.

02:02:36
I’d rather be too loose  (IN)
on it. I’ve had a number of lizards
unfortunately escape.
So you want to check out
your jaw muscles?

02:02:45
Yeah.  

02:02:48 (IN)
There we go.

02:03:05
Many lizards love doing
push-ups to prove
their territorial dominion.
But they’ll boogie quick enough
if something big enough
to eat them comes along…
like this rain forest water
monitor.
An excellent swimmer
and climber,
this guy will eat any fish,
birds,
or lizards it can catch.

02:03:50
Of all the beauties I’ve seen
in person,
this green vine snake is
near the top of the list.
Its architecture is unlike
any other.
Tightly arching ribs leave
the belly as flat as a ribbon
and enable it to stretch
long distances
between branches in its
slow quest for frogs and lizards.
It is mildly venomous,
but unlike a viper,
the fangs used to deliver
that venom
are small and deep in the
rear of its mouth.
I’m not worried.

02:04:35
Birds are learners when it
comes to food preparation.
Orioles in Mexico know how
to shuck Monarch butterflies,
removing the poison gland.

02:04:45
Here, blue magpies—very rare
and carnivorous members
of the crow family in fancy
blue and brown outfits—
have learned to diligently
rub the defensive barbs
off of caterpillars before
dining.

02:05:17
No rain forest is possible
without rain. 
Lots of it.

02:05:25
Rain and sun. Sun and rain.
These are constant gifts.

02:05:50
In places like this, wherever
man goes, life follows,
often in unintended ways.

02:05:58
Hang a light in the jungle
and you will be hosting
jumbo winged termites
at dusk.
Bring the termites and you
will have
gecko guests immediately,
competitive and greedy.

02:06:16
Nature provides for all
of its creatures.
Every animal has tastes
and appetites,
and Nature fills them.
How tragic it would be to
have these tiny lizards
yearning for eggs and bacon
and receive only termites?
Instead, they
desperately want
what nature already provides.

02:06:41
Feast little lizards.

02:06:47
Take the insects with gratitude.
We’ll take the bacon.

02:06:59
Above the rainforests, are the
lush cloud forests.
Watered by cloud vapor directly,
these forests don’t
need raindrops.
Up here—as is the
case everywhere—
not every critter is
easily lovable,
although I do my best.

02:07:16
Behold the land leech.
Quite small—only two inches
stretched—
but determined and armed with
tiny teeth in both ends,
enabling it to grab and climb.
Almost indestructible and
virtually without predators,
it works clumsily but
relentlessly,
stalking the scent of
exhaled CO2
in search of blood.
Today, lucky for it, I’m the one who provides.

02:08:22
Back down in the
hot lowlands,
there is this lovely lady.

02:08:29
One of my bucket list
animals that I have loved
from boyhood,
based solely on field
guide illustrations.
The star tortoise.
Beautifully patterned, but still
a harrumphy little tank.
A vegetarian with powerful
armored forelegs,
useful for burrowing and
barging through the long grass.
I have always wanted to
see a hardwood floor,
patterned off the design
on this shell.

02:08:56
Clearly, she is not as
excited to meet me 
But at least she’s giving
us a good look
at her elephantine rear
legs and feet—
one of the features that
distinguishes
all tortoises from what
we call turtles.

02:09:23
Alright. It’s time.
I won’t keep dodging it.
Let’s talk about snakes.
And not just the pretty ones.
The scary ones

02:09:36
For more than 120 years,
this man’s family has been at the forefront
of their local battle between humans
and serpents—
not through destruction,
but with cures.
Long before scientists
had even begun work on antivenins,
this family had developed
herbal remedies
for the deadliest of bites,
and they still house any
bite victim—
rich or poor—for as long
as it takes to cure
or bury them.
They also collect the
serpentine perpetrators,
along with some less
deadly varieties.

02:10:18
An Indian Rock Python,
nonvenomous,
but with a powerful bite.
One of the most famous
constrictors, and the model for many artists
when they’re choosing
which snake to cast
as an evil serpent.
This one has a taste for chickens.
Which is why it’s now in captivity.

02:10:43
Forsten’s cat snake.
Up to seven feet long,
but elusive and shy,
with jumbo eyes and a
triangular head
that gets it mistaken
for a viper.
This thing spends its days
high up in trees
or tucked into rafters.
More useful to have around
than a barn cat
if you don’t want a rodent
or lizard problem.
Quick to strike when
provoked,
but it offers no venomous
threat.

02:11:25
The common krait. 
Slender, simply banded,
often black or deep
sapphire blue.
Subdued in daylight, this guy is still quite
the killer.
A bite can feel mild
enough that people often shrug it off
only to die of respiratory failure
soon thereafter.

02:11:45
One nip from him packs
a punch that can easily outclass
a cobra’s.  That neurotoxin causes
paralysis by severing signals between
nerves and muscles.
Which means when you die,
it will be a result
of suffocation,
an inability to force your
lungs to breathe.

02:12:05
And he’s not the only
one that can kill…

02:12:10
The Russell’s viper.
This gent, a highly
camouflaged lurker,
literally kills thousands
all over Asia
and the Indian subcontinent
every year,
and it isn’t even an
aggressive snake.
Imagine if it were.
Especially since it’s strong
enough to hurl
all five feet of its
body length
into the air when it strikes.
With swinging front fangs
like a rattlesnake,
it easily delivers some of the
nastiest and complicated venom
on the planet.

02:12:43
Among other effects,
a drop or two of
its venom can solidify a cup of human
blood in seconds.

02:12:52
The Russell’s might
be deadly, but the hump-nosed
pit viper has a nastier attitude
and a more sleek and unique design.

02:13:01
Around here, it’s
a lightweight…

02:13:14
…but you still don’t want
those retractable needle fangs anywhere
in you.
If its juice gets in
your veins,
expect your kidneys to fail.

02:13:25
Like a rattlesnake, its pit
powered infrared vision
means it can see you
at night
when you can’t see it.
But it won’t rattle out
of politeness.

12:13:37
Yes, there are flying snakes,
but they have no wings.
Slender and even
beautifully floral
in their coloration,
these acrobats love to leap,
and they are designed to
do it well.
Able to flatten their
entire bodies,
they can slither across the air
from tree to tree.

02:13:56
When leaping from a treetop,
these snakes
have been witnessed gliding
more than one hundred yards before
touching down.

02:14:16
Last, but far from least,
the cobra.
Black cobras, brown cobras,
spitting cobras, king cobras,
there are more than
two dozen
different egg-loving
types that will angrily flare their
iconic hoods and fight.

02:14:34
All of them are venomous
and the largest,
the king cobra—up to
eighteen feet in length
is truly terrifying.

02:14:42
One bite from a king
delivers enough venom to
kill twenty men.

02:14:48
These snakes are elapids,
not vipers.
Which means their fangs
are up front and fixed,
not hinged, ready to deliver
neurotoxins and cardiotoxins,
racing to stop your lungs
or your heart first.

02:15:01
This is a spectacled cobra.
Surly enough even to strike
at shadows.

02:15:07
Rearing and slapping at you
rather than coiling and punching like a viper.
Absolutely deadly.
Its cloudy eye scale tells us
that it’s ready to shed.

02:15:21
People who fear these snakes
may believe that a fundamental
conflict exists
between mankind 
and serpents.
Statistics argue the same point.
The World Health Organization
claims that 100,000 people
are killed by venomous snakes
every year. And that’s a conservative
number.

02:15:46 
But will this struggle continue forever?

02:15:51
Can we learn to see snakes in another light?
Snakes are just another element of our diverse world.
No matter how they frighten us, they are part of our ecosystem.
And even if we don’t understand their role,
we must attempt to understand
and control our fear of the unknown.

02:16:05
If we learn to embrace all of nature,
and not just destroy what we don’t understand
this world will be so transformed
that we’ll even accept the serpents.

02:16:26
Maybe we’ll even accept cobras
in nature’s playground.

02:16:30
So let’s play, cobra.
I brought water balloons.

02:17:17
Wait. You thought we were done?

02:17:21
We’ve barely even started
exploring this amazing and magical 
world we live in!
