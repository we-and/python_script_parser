CAROLINE	We could get our Dad’s drone, we can fly it over the forest.

CALEB	Come look at this.

DAN	They’re covering something up. I’m Dan, by the way.

NATASHA	Anyway. You’re so warm. Like a racehorse. Dad’s in charge of that big water bottling plant down the road.

MITCH	Hexronn are stealing our water. That’s the man, who’s letting it happen.

SAM	Did you fix the wastewater overflow at the plant?

JAKE	Yeah. Yeah, it’s fine.

CAROLINE	That is so sad, I grew up in this swim hole.

CALEB	I’m, I’m gay.

ISSIE	And you haven’t told anyone else? Not even Caroline?

ISSIE	Hey.

ANISHA	Hey babe. Just got two words for you a hundred thousand.

ISSIE	Ah, that’s three. And just what are you going on about?

ANISHA	Followers. I’m like, a next level influencer now.

ISSIE	Oh, cool.

ANISHA	Not just cool, like, “how totally gutted are you that you’re not me right now” cool.

ISSIE	Yeah, I’m so gutted.

ANISHA	And, there’s this amazing Influencers’ event at Triello’s. I like, I might get invited.

ISSIE	What’s Triello’s?

ANISHA	What do you mean what’s Triello’s? How long have you been out of the country? What’s that?

ISSIE	What?

ANISHA	On the chair.

ISSIE	What? This?

ANISHA	Yeah, let’s have a look. Have you joined Gryffindor now?

ISSIE	No, it’s just something I had to wear to the Cross-Country Trials.

ANISHA	I cannot believe you’re in a pony club, it’s so hilarious, you’ve gone all Kiwi on me.

ISSIE	No, I haven’t. And look, I need to go, so…

ANISHA	Alright, bye.

ISSIE	Bye.

SAM	Julia. Hello, I, I didn’t know you were in the country.

JULIA	I flew in from Boston this morning.

SAM	Well you got in just in time. There’s a storm coming. Good flight?

JULIA	Frankly, I could do with a shower, and a large macchiato. So, you’ve been bombarding me with messages. Let’s talk about these, big concerns you have.

SAM	Well, I just feel like I’m being blindsided. Mistakes are happening, the whole situation with the wastewater…

JULIA	Well increasing our productivity was bound to have consequences.

SAM	But my company has a clean, green image.

JULIA	And we value that image. It’s one of the reasons we bought you.

SAM	But people are asking questions, Julia. And I don’t know what to say because I don’t know what’s going on. So, what aren’t you telling me?

JULIA	Sam, I didn’t realise you were so paranoid. Trust us. We’re on the same team.

CAROLINE	There.

NATASHA	It looks like a borehole.

CAROLINE	A what?

NATASHA	Where someone’s drilled. For water.

ISSIE	It must be Hexronn.

CAROLINE	But it’s in the forest, they can’t do that, I mean, it’s not legal right?

STELLA	I hate them.

NATASHA	Guys, you’ve got no proof. And my dad’s still in charge, he’s never gonna let anything bad happen.

DAN	That’s true. We don’t know anything for sure.

TOM	Hey, you lot, you better get the horses into the tractor shed. There’s a storm coming. A big one. Come on.

NATASHA	A please would be nice.

TOM	What?

NATASHA	Nothing.

ISSIE	Woah, woah, woah, easy, easy.

STELLA	What’s up with her?

ISSIE	I dunno. They’re all a bit edgy. Dan said they can tell when a storm’s coming.

STELLA	Coco.

ISSIE	I guess Coco’s feeling it too.

STELLA	No, she’s just on the rug, get off Coco.

ISSIE	You two have the strangest relationship.

STELLA	See Coco, people think you’re a weirdo.

ISSIE	I think she just laughed at you.

ISSIE	Shh, shh. Do you think Tom would let me stay with her tonight?

STELLA	Well, we can ask.

TOM	What? You’re freaking me out.

ISSIE	Can we stay here tonight?

CAROLINE	You know, to keep an eye on the horses with the hurricane and everything.

CALEB	It’s not a hurricane.

TOM	You’re asking for favours? After the stunt you pulled at the cross country.

ISSIE	Yeah, but, Blaze is really jumpy and I’m just listening to my horse. Like you said.

TOM	Well, it’ll be good for the horses.

ISSIE	Thanks, great.

NATASHA	Hey Tom, could I grab Aramis’ pom poms?

ISSIE	Seriously? Pom poms?

NATASHA	They’re for his ears, so he can’t hear the thunder.

STELLA	Cool, makes him deaf like me.

TOM	Yeah, alright, okay, see you later. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Make sure you call your folks, I don’t want any of them ragging on me. Especially yours, and Stella, I think your mum wants you to go home.

STELLA	Yeah sure.

ISSIE	Really?

STELLA	It’s pizza night.

CAROLINE	We’ll look after Coco for you.

STELLA	Ha, good luck.

CAROLINE	Tom lives here mum. Seriously? Caleb, mum wants you.

CALEB	Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. It’s alright. We can stay. Oh, could you get her to drop off my, retainer.

CAROLINE	Oh, you’re such a suck up.

CALEB	She just loves me more. Hey Is, chuck us Gally’s jute rug.

ISSIE	Ok.

CALEB	That one.

ISSIE	Caleb.

CALEB	Oh yeah, it’s a bit gross.

ISSIE	Yeah, you could have said.

CALEB	Yeah, but it wouldn’t have been as funny.

CALEB	Hey wait no. That is not, that is not funny.

ISSIE	Yes it is.

DAN	Must be a power cut.

NATASHA	This is officially super creepy.

DAN	Well at least we got the horses done in time.

ISSIE	Let’s go back.

CAROLINE	Night Treacle. Sweet dreams.

ISSIE	Do they dream?

CAROLINE	Treacle dreams of winning Olympic gold.

CALEB	Even your horse is full of it.

CALEB	Moscovium, mercury, radon, neon, argon, krypton. Xenon, that’s a good one.

CAROLINE	No.

NATASHA	Oh, make it stop.

ISSIE	Oh, no, no, no, something just went across my hand.

DAN	It was probably a spider.

CAROLINE	Don’t worry they’re not venomous. Except the Katipo.

NATASHA	Have you seen a weta? They’re like, massive cockroaches. My dad’s definitely afraid of them.

ISSIE	Ugh. Ugh.

DAN	Yeah, you would never be a kiwi, London.

ISSIE	Yeah, I’m not sure I’m London either, anymore.

CALEB	What?

ISSIE	Nothing.

TOM	You lot alright?

CAROLINE	Fine.

DAN	Yeah, we’re good.

TOM	Good, I’ve just come to ask if you need any torches, but I see you’ve got your…

ISSIE	We’re Gen Z, we’ve got tech for every crisis.

TOM	Until your batteries die. I’m gonna go and fix the generator.

DAN	Let’s tell ghost stories.

NATASHA	No let’s play Truth or Dare.

CAROLINE	Yes, and everyone has to say their deepest, darkest secret. Or forfeit.

CALEB	Let’s not.

CAROLINE	You’re just saying that because your deepest, darkest secret is that you buff your toenails.

NATASHA	Really?

ISSIE	We had a power cut at Christmas once, and my dad got us to play sardines.

NATASHA	Sardines?

ISSIE	Yeah, it’s a really silly game. So, someone hides, and then everyone searches for them, and when you find them, you join them, until there’s only one left.

CALEB	Basically, Hide and Seek.

ISSIE	Yeah. My dad was, a big kid really.

DAN	Come on then. I’ll hide.

ISSIE	Really?

DAN	Yeah, if it stops Caleb from listing the whole periodic table, I’ll do anything.

NATASHA	I knew you wouldn’t turn it off. Move over.

ISSIE	Oh, it’s just you.

CALEB	Great minds.

ISSIE	Yeah, I thought he’d double bluff and come back.

CALEB	Yeah, he’s um, he’s sneaky.

ISSIE	So. You haven’t told anyone about your deepest, darkest, secret yet then?

CALEB	No, it’s, I mean I want to, it’s just, finding the right, time. Like, what do I say, hey everybody, I’m gay.

ISSIE	Yeah, basically. But, when you’re ready.

CALEB	I’m, I’m working on it. Ok?

ISSIE	Well, you know we can’t be searching together? So, I’m gonna go have a look at the horse box.

CALEB	I’ll check round the back.

ISSIE	Ok.

NATASHA	I love that sound. It gives me chills.

DAN	Yeah. It’s best when you’re camping, you know? When there’s nothing but a tent between you and the force of nature.

NATASHA	You should go. To the outback and stuff. When you do your internship in Oz.

DAN	I have to get it first.

NATASHA	I thought you said you passed the test.

DAN	Yeah, but there’ll be heaps of people who applied.

NATASHA	They’ll definitely want you. You’re amazing.

DAN	Tell that to my dad.

NATASHA	Why?

DAN	He thinks I’ll be disappointed. He’s scared that I’ll mess up, and, I don’t know, I think he’s more scared that I’ll nail it.

NATASHA	How do you mean?

DAN	He’s never even tried to leave this place. Think it’d suit him if I was the same.

NATASHA	You’re not.

DAN	Really?

NATASHA	Apart from your taste in music.

DAN	Ha, Phil Collins is a genius.

NATASHA	I remember my mum and stepdad went to see him for their anniversary. Came back with matching t-shirts. It was super lame.

DAN	You mean super cool. How are things? With your mum.

NATASHA	Oh, you know. Annoying. We have these really awkward phone conversations once a week, where she pretends to be interested. She’s obsessed with the new baby, it’s like, I don’t know, whatever.

DAN	That sucks.

NATASHA	Yeah.

NATASHA	Hey, Dan.

ISSIE	Got cha.

DAN	Hey Issie.

ISSIE	What were you talking about?

NATASHA	Nothing.

CALEB	He’s, he’s not here. Are you alright?

CALEB	Caroline?

CALEB	Caroline.

CALEB	Hey. Caz. What’s wrong?

NATASHA	Should we be up here? In a storm?

ISSIE	Ok, maybe you’re right.

CALEB	Yeah let’s go back. This is creeping me out.

TOM	Everybody alright?

DAN	Oh yeah, we’re sweet.

TOM	What are you fullas doing up there?

DAN	Um. Playing sardines.

TOM	What?

CALEB	She started it.

ISSIE	It’s a game. It’s an English thing.

TOM	Right. Oh well, when you’ve finished your cucumber sandwiches, I want you to double check the bin lids are secure.

ISSIE	Does he ever come into a room without telling everyone what to do?

TOM	No. Bin lids.

ISSIE	Hey, Caroline, do you want some crisps?

CAROLINE	We call them chips in New Zealand, Issie.

ISSIE	Ok.

CALEB	Leave her. She’s in a mood.

MITCH	That’s a welcome.

ISSIE	Gran. What are you doing here?

MITCH	Looking for Tom. Where is he?

CALEB	Shouting at a generator probably.

MITCH	Oh well, it seems to have worked.

NATASHA	Urggghhhh, I’ve been eating horse treats. No wonder they tasted so weird.

CALEB	But you carried on eating them.

NATASHA	I was bored.

TOM	Good, back on. Kia Ora Mitch. It’s a bit of a night to drop by.

MITCH	Yeah. I’ve got something here to show you.

TOM	You kids checked your horses recently?

ISSIE	Every time.

DAN	Yeah, they’re all fed and watered.

MITCH	Look who’s trying to buy me out.

TOM	What did you tell them?

ISSIE	Is that from Hexronn?

MITCH	I said, “over my dead body”. Did you get a letter?

TOM	Aah, maybe.

TOM	So, I’m a bit behind on the admin. Sorry Mitch.

TOM	Woah, don’t believe it. No way they’re getting my stables.

MITCH	Ah.

NATASHA	I don’t understand. Why do they want it? They’ve got dad’s plant already.

ISSIE	Caleb. Where exactly was the borehole again?

CALEB	Here.

ISSIE	Gran, come see this. And that’s the water bottling plant, right? So look.

MITCH	We’re right in the middle.

ISSIE	Mmm hmm.

TOM	What borehole?

DAN	We found it. In the forest.

CAROLINE	We think they’re drilling for water there.

NATASHA	But we don’t know anything for sure.

TOM	Right, I don’t think they’re gonna pipe that water across our land aye?

MITCH	Yeah. Looks like it. Who do they think they are?

ISSIE	Wait, what’s that?

DAN	Looks like an underground river, or something.

ISSIE	What? And this?

CAROLINE	That’s the swim hole, so it was Hexronn. They ruined our swim hole.

MITCH	What do you mean?

CALEB	We saw it the other day. It was all toxic.

DAN	Do you think Hexronn are pumping wastewater into it or something?

TOM	Could be.

ISSIE	And Gran, that’s where your dead bees were.

MITCH	Bunch of environmental marauders.

ISSIE	Can they even get away with all of this?

TOM	I think they probably can.

ISSIE	Oh, wow, that’s some rain.

MITCH	Oh, crikey, I wonder if I shut the car window?

ISSIE	Don’t worry Gran, I’ve got it.

MITCH	Thanks, love.

TOM	You’re kidding me. Dan, can you check the leak in the storage room please?

DAN	Oh yeah, no worries. Give me a hand Nats.

NATASHA	Sure.

ISSIE	My ring.

ISSIE	Blaze.

ISSIE	Hey Blaze, are you ok?

ISSIE	Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. It’s ok. It’s ok. It’s ok.

ISSIE	It was Hexronn.

DAN	You ok?

NATASHA	My dad’s like, public enemy number one, eh.

DAN	No.

NATASHA	Do you think they’re evil then, Hexronn?

DAN	Evil, my dad works there, so.

NATASHA	Exactly, like what have they actually done, other than give heaps of people new jobs?

DAN	Yeah.

NATASHA	You don’t agree.

DAN	I’m not a fan of big companies coming in and taking over. It’s like they’re all just about money.

DAN	Hey, no, it’s, it wasn’t about you, or you dad, it’s so much bigger than that. It’s ok. He puts his arm around her. Natasha leans in for a moment. And then she turns to kiss him, he pulls away gently.

DAN	Oh. Ah, look.

NATASHA	No, no, I, I, I thought that’s what you…

DAN	Oh.

NATASHA	I, I, yeah, I have to…

DAN	Natasha, no. Natasha.

MITCH	She ok?

DAN	Yeah.

MITCH	Hey look, listen love, I can’t find Issie.

DAN	What?

MITCH	I’ve got to make a move now before I need a canoe, can you tell her I’ve gone.

DAN	Sure.

ISSIE	It’s ok, it’s ok. I know what you’ve been through, but I’m here, you don’t need to be scared. I promise you, I’ll get you back to your herd.

DAN	Hey, I was worried about you.

ISSIE	Why?

DAN	I don’t know, Mitch said she couldn’t find you.

ISSIE	Dan, I think I know why Blaze is so scared.

DAN	Why?

CALEB	Hey Caz. Why are you being so quiet? It’s freaking me out.

CAROLINE	Really? Cos you’re always going on about how noisy I am. Thought you’d be happy.

ISSIE	We need to find a way to stop Hexronn.

DAN	You ok?

ISSIE	Yeah, I just… the herd, where do we think they were?

CALEB	We found evidence of them here.

ISSIE	Look how close to the borehole it is. I knew it. That’s why they left. The noise of the drilling.

CAROLINE	You mean Hexronn made them bolt?

CALEB	They shouldn’t be drilling there.

DAN	Yeah, it’s an ancient forest. It’s untouched.

ISSIE	Until now, we need to stop them.

CALEB	What can we do, we’re kids?

CAROLINE	So is Greta Thunberg.

ISSIE	Exactly. We need to start a campaign. Tell everyone what they’re up to.

STELLA	I was about to crush level  of DevilStar. This better be good.

CAROLINE	We need a killer website.

ISSIE	We’re gonna start a campaign to stop Hexronn.

STELLA	No probs, but how are we gonna cut through the traffic?

ISSIE	What?

STELLA	There’s a lot of noise out there. We need to get noticed.

ISSIE	Hey guys. I might know someone.

ISSIE	This is my friend Anisha. This is Caleb, Caroline, Dan and Stella.

CALEB	Hi.

STELLA	Hi.

ANISHA	Hey guys.

ANISHA	So, you’re the ones that have turned my mate all kiwi then?

DAN	Are you kidding? She’s all London.

ISSIE	Maybe I’m neither.

CALEB	Maybe you’re both.

ISSIE	Ok, well, maybe I’m global then. Hey, Anish, we need your help. We want to take down a totally evil corporation.

ANISHA	Ooh, I like the sound of that.

ANISHA	Wow. New Zealand’s loud.

ISSIE	Yeah, there’s this epic storm.

CALEB	We’re having unseasonable blasts at the moment, up to  kilometres an hour.

ISSIE	Are you guys good, because I need to go and check on Blaze.

ANISHA	Yeah, we’re golden.

CALEB	Yep, golden.

ISSIE	Hey. Blaze. You ok?

ISSIE	Natasha. You’re soaking wet.

NATASHA	Went for a walk.

ISSIE	Look. You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. But, I won’t judge you. Well, unless it’s because New Zealand lost the rugby, then I really will judge you.

NATASHA	I can’t tell you, it’s so embarrassing.

ISSIE	What?

NATASHA	I just, I kinda, I kinda thought Dan liked me, and so, I kind of showed him how I felt. And, um, it was so awkward.

ISSIE	Are you sure? He might not of realised…

NATASHA	Believe me, it was obvious. How am I ever gonna face him again?

ISSIE	Come on, it’s Dan, he’s cool.

NATASHA	I know he’s cool. That’s why I like him, because he’s kind and funny and, he’s, cute.

ISSIE	Yeah, he is. I mean, he’s nice. You know?

STELLA	Hey, I made a GIF.

DAN	Oh wow, that’s great. My dad is gonna kill me.

CALEB	Amazing Stella. We should send it to Anisha.

STELLA	Cool.

CALEB	What do you reckon Caz?

CAROLINE	I don’t know, ‘cause you’re in my way.

CALEB	Well go around me.

CAROLINE	Or you could move.

CALEB	Or you could move.

CAROLINE	Fine.

CALEB	Caroline.

STELLA	What was that about?

DAN	I have no idea.

CALEB	Caroline.

CAROLINE	What?

CALEB	What is your problem.

CAROLINE	You. You’re my problem.

CALEB	You’re being a total pain.

CAROLINE	Well why don’t you go and moan to Issie about it.

CALEB	What?

CAROLINE	I heard you. In the lounge.

CALEB	Heard what?

CAROLINE	Everything. How could you? Did you think I’d have a problem with it or something?

CALEB	No. I just.

CAROLINE	I’m your twin. I’m supposed to be your best friend. How could you tell her first?

CALEB	I don’t know.

CAROLINE	Great.

ISSIE	Just walk in like everything’s normal.

NATASHA	But it’s so embarrassing. The way that he looked at me, like, like he was really sorry for me. I’m such a loser. How am I going to pretend everything’s normal?

ISSIE	Oh hey, Natasha. Honestly, it’s fine, he’s not gonna…

TOM	Oh woah. Um, I was just checking on the… one, two… six… yeah, ah, you ok? Yeah? Ah? Oh, ah, you got this… that’s good, I’m just gonna, ah, check the thing…

ISSIE	Well, at least you know how to scare Tom.

NATASHA	Yeah.

ISSIE	Don’t worry, ok? You know, once, I fancied this boy at school, so, I sent him a text, asking him out, ugh, and he sent it to the whole class. I quoted a song lyric. It wasn’t even a good one. Yep.

NATASHA	So, then what happened?

ISSIE	I immigrated.

NATASHA	What?

ISSIE	I’m kidding. Everyone literally forgot about it the next day.

NATASHA	Wow, that was inspiring. You should do a TED talk.

ISSIE	Yeah.

NATASHA	Hey. Thanks.

ISSIE	It’s ok.

DAN	Hey, Natasha.

CALEB	Look, we made a crime board.

CAROLINE	Stella’s put it all on the website as well.

DAN	Yeah, it’s pretty crazy stuff.

CAROLINE	We have to get the truth out there.

CALEB	Yeah.

NATASHA	What?

ISSIE	Oh, um. We’re just trying to let people know about some of the stuff Hexronn are doing.

NATASHA	My dad wouldn’t do anything like this.

ISSIE	Oh, no, no, no, no, we’re not saying your dad did that, I mean, my mum works there and so does Dan’s dad. It’s got nothing to do with them. It’s Hexronn.

DAN	Hey Nats, it, it’s not personal.

NATASHA	It’s pathetic and childish.

ISSIE	Look, we have to do something to stop them. Hexronn drove out the herd.

NATASHA	How do you know?

ISSIE	I had a vision.

NATASHA	Are you joking? A horse told you do this?

ISSIE	No.

NATASHA	Look, you have no proof Hexronn has done anything illegal, it’s all just wild speculation. You’re gonna look like a bunch of stupid little kids.

ISSIE	Well. I guess we could hold back until we get more proof.

CALEB	I don’t think we can hold this back.

NATASHA	What?

CALEB	Your friend, Anisha, she’s good. Like, really connected.

CAROLINE	Woah, how many?

ISSIE	Wow. That’s a lot of hits.

NATASHA	Well done guys. You have no idea what you’ve just done.

CAROLINE	You don’t think she’s right, do you?
