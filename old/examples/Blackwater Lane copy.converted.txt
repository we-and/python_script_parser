CASS	My favorite time of year is when summer finally gives way to autumn.
CASS	The falling leaves seem to remind us that the only constant is change.
CASS	So trust the journey, both good and bad.
CASS	Because all of it takes you where you're going next.
CASS	And...
CASS	I guess what happened is a part of that.
ANDREW	"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
ANDREW	or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing, end them."
CASS	Very nice, Andrew.
CASS	And that was the last monologue of the term.
CASS	Everyone have a great break.
ANDREW	Mrs. Anderson, this has been my best class.
CASS	Thank you, Andrew. I'm so glad you liked it.
ANDREW	Hey, Mrs. Anderson, any special plans?
CASS	Not really.
CASS	We're redoing our house. Always fun stuff to do with that.
ANDREW	May I ask you a question I've always wondered about?
CASS	What have you always wondered about?
ANDREW	Is your husband also American?
CASS	Uh, he's half British like me. We're expats.
CASS	So is my best friend, actually.
ANDREW	She is?
CASS	She is. Our moms were best friends who both married Brits.
ANDREW	What does your husband do?
CASS	You're a very curious young man.
ANDREW	Hi, Mr. Collins.
CASS	Hey, John.
JOHN	Hey, Cass. I was just coming to find you.
JOHN	Hi, Andrew.
JOHN	I thought you'd be running out of here now term's over.
ANDREW	Oh, I am. Just walking Mrs. Anderson out.
ANDREW	Have a lovely holiday.
CASS	You too, Andrew. Thank you.
CASS	And make sure you read that Uta Hagen book. You're doing beautiful work. You're ready for it.
ANDREW	Will do. Thanks.
JOHN	Are you coming to the Anchor Inn with us?
CASS	Oh, absolutely. I can taste the G&T now.
CASS	I'll see you there.
JOHN	Great.
CASS	Good night.
JOHN	Good night, guys.
CASS	Whoo! Wow.
JOHN	It's a pretty bad storm.
JOHN	You sure you'll be okay getting home?
CASS	Yeah, of course. Thank you.
JOHN	I could drop you off. There's no trouble.
CASS	I'm okay. Thank you.
JOHN	Good night.
CASS	Hey, I'm on my way. Everything all right?
MATTHEW	Yes, but I'm exhausted. Do you mind if I go up to bed?
CASS	Of course not.
MATTHEW	I should wait up for you.
CASS	I'll be fine.
CASS	It'll only take me about 40 minutes unless I go through the woods.
MATTHEW	That road's a nightmare. I wouldn't take it.
CASS	Okay.
MATTHEW	Promise.
CASS	Promise. Love you.
MATTHEW	Love you more.
CASS	Bye.
MATTHEW	Morning, darling.
MATTHEW	It's 9:00.
MATTHEW	I've been up since 7:00.
CASS	Mm.
CASS	You sleep okay?
MATTHEW	Like a rock.
MATTHEW	Sorry I didn't wait up.
CASS	No.
MATTHEW	Hey, how was that drive last night?
CASS	Hmm...
CASS	A lot of thunder, lightning and rain.
MATTHEW	Woman's been found dead not that far from here.
CASS	Hmm.
MATTHEW	Just heard it on the news.
CASS	That's awful. Where?
MATTHEW	On that road that leads between the woods and Castle Wells.
CASS	What road?
MATTHEW	Blackwater Lane.
MATTHEW	Where are you going?
CASS	Shower. I didn't want to wake you.
MATTHEW	I'll make breakfast.
CASS	I'm gonna get Susie's presents.
CASS	I'll get something later.
REPORTER	A woman has been found dead in her car on Blackwater Lane in the early hours of the morning.
REPORTER	Her death is being treated as suspicious.
REPORTER	No further details have been given, but police are advising people in the area to be vigilant.
CASS	Any luck on finding a new contractor?
MATTHEW	Interviewing a few guys, but I don't want to rush it,
MATTHEW	you know, and have the same problems.
CASS	Why don't we just focus on finding the right guy? It's been two weeks.
MATTHEW	Yeah. I know.
CASS	I gotta go.
MATTHEW	All right. Where you going?
CASS	Uh, I gotta meet Rachel.
MATTHEW	Yeah? Well, wait, aren't we wasting a perfectly good morning?
CASS	This is driving me nuts.
MATTHEW	I'm loving it.
CASS	She's my best friend.
MATTHEW	Yeah.
MATTHEW	Yeah, yeah.
CASS	Thank you for breakfast.
MATTHEW	Of course.
RACHEL	So then did it get really wild last night?
CASS	Oh, yeah, about as wild as it can get with a bunch of teachers.
RACHEL	Mm!
CASS	I do think I overdid it with the gin a tiny bit, though.
RACHEL	That's my girl.
RACHEL	And was gorgeous John there?
CASS	Gorgeous John. Yes. John was there.
RACHEL	He still likes you.
CASS	No.
RACHEL	Sorry, "fancies you."
CASS	No, he doesn't.
CASS	He has a girlfriend now, and not to mention I have a husband.
RACHEL	I wonder if the girlfriend knows about the rumors of a first wife?
CASS	No. God, I don't believe a word of that.
CASS	I guarantee she's simply moved away.
RACHEL	I don't know. Susie swears she's missing.
CASS	Oh, God. Susie's too much.
CASS	Susie apparently has a dossier on everyone from Houghton Moor to London.
CASS	And apparently the new girlfriend is very cute.
CASS	And, Rache?
RACHEL	Mm-hmm?
CASS	I really need you to be more supportive of Matthew.
RACHEL	I am so supportive of Matthew.
RACHEL	He could be a little bit nicer to me.
CASS	You two did get off to a bit of a rough start.
RACHEL	It's my job to be protective of you.
RACHEL	You were so vulnerable after your mom.
CASS	I know.
CASS	And thank you.
CASS	Anyway, more importantly, how was your trip?
RACHEL	Too many meetings and way too much alcohol.
CASS	Sounds good.
RACHEL	Mm-hmm. Mm! And...
RACHEL	Of course.
CASS	My tea towel?
RACHEL	The Sisterhood of the Traveling Tea Towel continues.
RACHEL	I found that randomly looking for my birth certificate.
CASS	Oh, my God.
RACHEL	You were the greatest Regina in the history of the theater.
CASS	I can't believe it's been almost 20 years.
CASS	I love Lillian Hellman.
CASS	I think it's going to be our school drama next year.
RACHEL	No way.
CASS	Yeah.
RACHEL	Seems like you're really loving teaching.
CASS	I am.
CASS	But my agent called recently, randomly out of nowhere, about an audition,
CASS	which is kind of weird because I've been missing it a little bit.
RACHEL	You think you're going to go back?
CASS	Matthew's not really for it, especially if we want to have a baby.
CASS	I know, I know, I can do both. Imagine.
CASS	Anyway, did you get one too?
RACHEL	Yeah, of course.
RACHEL	Tradition.
CASS	I love our tradition.
CASS	Mom and I used to shop on Saturday mornings.
RACHEL	Yeah.
CASS	She came through the other day. I meant to tell you.
RACHEL	Really?
CASS	Yeah.
RACHEL	How?
CASS	Tarot.
CASS	It was very dramatic, it was very her.
RACHEL	Very.
CASS	Should find something for Susie.
RACHEL	Wait, I thought you already did?
CASS	No, I haven't had time. What should we get?
RACHEL	I thought...
RACHEL	We all decided and pooled our money and gave it to you.
CASS	What? When did that happen?
RACHEL	At Hannah's.
RACHEL	We each put in 20, so you should have 160 pounds.
RACHEL	And... it was your idea, remember?
RACHEL	Since Steven's taking her to Venice that we get lightweight luggage?
CASS	Yeah, I remember.
CASS	I'll stop by the luggage shop on the way home.
MATTHEW	So, did you buy out Bond Street?
CASS	My God.
CASS	Don't sneak up on me like that.
MATTHEW	Sorry.
CASS	Did you see that man out there?
MATTHEW	What?
CASS	Outside, just in front of the house.
MATTHEW	Uh...
MATTHEW	No, I didn't see anybody.
CASS	Well, he was just there.
MATTHEW	Let me see.
MATTHEW	Where? There?
CASS	I'm not making it up.
CASS	What?
MATTHEW	Come on, Cass.
MATTHEW	Your imagination is just... it's a little bit "out there" sometimes.
CASS	Matthew. I didn't imagine it.
RACHEL	Hey, beauty.
CASS	Hi.
RACHEL	Hi.
CASS	Hi.
RACHEL	Hey, Matthew.
MATTHEW	Hey, Rachel. How's it going?
RACHEL	You're never gonna believe this.
RACHEL	The woman who was murdered, she worked at my company.
MATTHEW	I'm gonna get us drinks.
CASS	Thank you, babe.
CASS	Wow, did you know her?
RACHEL	No, different division, but I feel really bad
RACHEL	because I came straight into the office from the airport yesterday
RACHEL	and I was jet-lagged and I just kind of got into it with someone over a parking space,
RACHEL	and I'm pretty sure it was her.
CASS	Oh, you couldn't have known.
RACHEL	And Susie's really upset because apparently she knows the husband,
RACHEL	who's devastated and he's left on his own to raise 2-year-old twins.
RACHEL	I mean, it's a tragedy.
CASS	Twins?
CASS	What was her name?
RACHEL	Jane Walters.
CASS	Oh, God, it can't be her.
RACHEL	How would you know her?
CASS	I met her at the leaving party that you took me to.
CASS	We got to talking and we exchanged numbers.
CASS	I told you about it when you were in New York.
RACHEL	I mean, I don't remember, but you could have.
RACHEL	And it's not like I would know who she is, right?
CASS	Yeah.
RACHEL	I mean...
CASS	Oh, wow.
RACHEL	It's...
CASS	No, I was supposed to go to her house in the next couple of weeks to meet her kids.
RACHEL	Really gives you a perspective.
RACHEL	Scary.
SUSIE	Hey, love! Are you empty handed?
CASS	Hi. It's okay, Matthew's getting me a drink.
CASS	I didn't know you knew John Collins. He works at my school.
SUSIE	I love John. John is my tennis coach.
MATTHEW	Hey, Susie.
SUSIE	Hey, John. Oh.
MATTHEW	Susie. Happy birthday.
SUSIE	Thank you, Matthew.
SUSIE	Hey, John. Come over here and come and say hi.
JACK	Hi.
SUSIE	Oh, not you, Jack, John.
JACK	Sorry, sorry, I need to borrow the birthday girl for a photo shoot.
SUSIE	Um... I'll be back.
CASS	Hi, John.
JOHN	Hey, Cass. You all right?
CASS	This is my husband, Matthew.
JOHN	Nice to meet you.
MATTHEW	Hi, nice to meet you too.
CASS	I didn't know you were a tennis coach.
SUSIE	Hey, John, come say hi to my old doubles partner.
JOHN	Yeah, I used to play pro many years ago.
JOHN	I just coach on the side now.
SUSIE	Come on, Johnny, come on.
JOHN	Look...
SUSIE	Come and say hi.
JOHN	I think I've gotta go. Uh... nice to see you, Matt.
JOHN	And, uh... I'll see you soon, Cass.
CASS	Okay.
MATTHEW	Interesting.
MATTHEW	Police released a photo.
CASS	Show me.
CASS	Oh, my God, that is her.
CASS	That makes no sense. Why Jane?
MATTHEW	Unless it's random.
CASS	What do you mean, like a serial killer?
CASS	We should upgrade the system in the house.
CASS	This thing's useless. Half the sensors don't even work.
MATTHEW	Yeah.
CASS	And a dog.
MATTHEW	No, no.
CASS	No, we should get a dog.
MATTHEW	I thought you wanted a baby.
MATTHEW	It's a good idea to get the alarm system fixed, yeah.
MATTHEW	It'll just be one of us constantly setting that thing off.
CASS	Where are you going?
MATTHEW	To make sure everything's locked downstairs.
CASS	Hello?
CASS	Hello?
MATTHEW	Who's that at this hour?
CASS	There was nobody there.
MATTHEW	Well...
MATTHEW	It's probably just a misdial.
CASS	Yeah.
MATTHEW	It's nothing.
CASS	Hopefully.
MATTHEW	It's nothing.
CASS	Everything locked up?
MATTHEW	It's all locked.
REPORTER	A picture is emerging of the mother found dead on Blackwater Lane, Jane Walters.
REPORTER	Just before 10:00 p.m., she left a voicemail message on her husband's mobile.
REPORTER	The police have estimated her murder to have happened between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m.
REPORTER	Her husband, Alex Walters, is appealing for help from the public and police have established an anonymous tip line.
NEWSCASTER	Thanks, Jessica. We will keep the public informed...
NEWSCASTER	Moving on to today's news...
NEWSCASTER	...we have a summer fête...
CASS	Matt?
NEWSCASTER	What they're doing is raising money for a local charity for the elderly.
CASS	Matt?
CASS	Matt?
CASS	Matt, is that you?
CASS	Hello? Hello? (man coughing over static)
CASS	Oh, I just called this morning. I thought you were coming tomorrow.
SECURITY MAN	Yes, but there was a cancellation and I was in the area.
SECURITY MAN	Sorry I didn't call.
SECURITY MAN	Is your husband there?
CASS	No, he's not. Um...
CASS	But I guess it's fine if you want to just take a quick look.
CASS	Will this take long? I was just leaving.
SECURITY MAN	Uh, no more than ten minutes.
SECURITY MAN	Are you often in the house on your own?
CASS	No, no. My husband will be back any minute.
SECURITY MAN	Well, looking at your house, I'd say you're a prime target for burglars.
SECURITY MAN	You've got a system that is obsolete.
SECURITY MAN	You need to get new sensors for the windows, doors, stairs as well.
SECURITY MAN	I'll just take a quick look.
SECURITY MAN	Sorry.
CASS	It's all right.
SECURITY MAN	Right. Uh... Shall we go and sit down?
CASS	Actually, you know, I don't think we need an upgrade after all.
SECURITY MAN	Well, after the murder of that young woman, I'd say you're making a mistake.
SECURITY MAN	I mean, don't forget, the murderer is still out there.
CASS	Maybe you just come back after my husband's here.
SECURITY MAN	I don't know when I can.
SECURITY MAN	Murder's good for business, if you know what I mean.
SECURITY MAN	Actually...
SECURITY MAN	I don't need to walk the house.
SECURITY MAN	I've already got a copy of the layout.
SECURITY MAN	I'll send you an estimate.
CASS	There is something in the house.
MATTHEW	What?
CASS	I thought I was dead.
MATTHEW	Stay there, I'll call the police.
CASS	Wait, wait, wait.
CASS	I just wanna make sure.
CASS	I mean, I am. It's just I haven't seen anybody, so I just want you to come and check and make sure before we get the police out.
CASS	Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry. I told my husband not to call you guys.
DC LAWSON	Call us?
CASS	I'm... I was just taking a bath
CASS	and I thought I heard someone.
CASS	But I didn't actually see anybody, so I don't even know how they would have gotten in the house.
CASS	So I'm just... unsure.
DC LAWSON	Are you Cass Anderson?
CASS	Yes.
DC LAWSON	Well, actually we are here about Jane Walters.
CASS	Jane Walters?
DC LAWSON	We received a tip that you were on Blackwater Lane the night of her murder.
DC LAWSON	Is that true?
CASS	I'm sorry.
CASS	Uh, yes.
CASS	I was on that road that night.
CASS	And I was going to call the tip line, but I just hadn't come up with the nerve just yet.
DC LAWSON	Okay. Can we come in?
CASS	Yeah, of course.
MATTHEW	What's going on? You all right?
MATTHEW	Babe?
CASS	I think I just... I took a bath and I slipped and I got confused and I'm not sure what happened.
DC LAWSON	So you stopped.
DC LAWSON	You saw that it was a woman, and then you just... you drove on home.
DC LAWSON	But you knew Jane Walters.
CASS	I had met her a few weeks before.
CASS	But it was raining so hard that night, I could only see that it was the shape of a woman.
CASS	I couldn't see her face.
DC LAWSON	You didn't try to see if she needed help?
CASS	Didn't seem like she needed any.
DC LAWSON	So you just kept on driving?
DC LAWSON	Did you see anyone else around?
DC LAWSON	Did you notice anything?
CASS	Um... no.
CASS	I... I...
CASS	I took my foot off the brake to signal that I was leaving and she didn't respond, so I...
CASS	I left.
DC LAWSON	Okay.
MATTHEW	Why didn't you tell me?
CASS	Did you open that window?
MATTHEW	No, it was like that when I came in. Don't change the subject.
MATTHEW	I told you not to take that road. Why didn't you tell me you drove by that car?
CASS	I shut that before I took a bath. I checked the door and all the windows.
MATTHEW	Cass, why didn't you tell me?
CASS	Because I knew you'd get angry if I drove through the forest and I didn't feel like arguing about the way that I drove home.
MATTHEW	You should have told me.
CASS	Fine. Jesus Christ.
CASS	Do you know what this means?
CASS	The murderer reported this.
MATTHEW	Murderer? How do you know that?
MATTHEW	It could... It could have been anybody.
MATTHEW	How do you know somebody wasn't following you in a car?
CASS	No.
MATTHEW	Or standing in the woods?
CASS	No, it had to have been who killed her.
MATTHEW	You don't know that.
MATTHEW	You said she was still alive when you were there.
CASS	I thought she was, but what do I know? I couldn't see two feet in front of me.
MATTHEW	Got to get that alarm system set up before I go away this week.
CASS	Go away this week?
MATTHEW	Yeah, I gotta go to the rig. We discussed it.
CASS	No, you never said anything.
MATTHEW	Of course, I did.
CASS	When?
MATTHEW	Well, three weeks ago when I first found out.
CASS	No. You didn't. I would have remembered.
CASS	And stop telling me you said something when you didn't.
RACHEL	Yeah, I can. Yeah, sure, I can come over.
CASS	You can?
RACHEL	Yeah. I've got to wine and dine some clients that night,
RACHEL	but I will drive over the minute I'm done.
CASS	Are you sure?
RACHEL	Yeah, very sure. It'll be a pajama party.
RACHEL	But right now I have to run into a meeting.
CASS	Okay. Rache? Thank you.
CASS	Hello?
CASS	Who's there?
CASS	Andrew. What are you doing here?
ANDREW	Happened to be in the area and I wanted to drop off your book.
CASS	How do you know where I live?
ANDREW	Harry Freeman lives just one street over. He told me you lived here.
ANDREW	But really, pretty much everybody knows you bought the old Crawford house.
CASS	I didn't know that.
ANDREW	Yeah, I mean, it's sat empty for so long, um...
ANDREW	My mum gives local tours and she always talks about it being one of the original houses in the village.
ANDREW	Is it true that it's haunted?
CASS	Uh, It's possible.
CASS	I've heard a lot of unexplained creaks recently.
ANDREW	Anyhow, I love the book.
ANDREW	It's really changed my perspective on things, so...
ANDREW	Thanks for thinking of me.
CASS	Uh... I'd love to stay and talk with you about this,
CASS	but I was just on my way out.
CASS	Did you walk here?
ANDREW	No, I biked over. Don't live too far.
ANDREW	Just on the other side of Blackwater Lane.
CASS	Lovely.
ANDREW	Thanks again, Mrs. Anderson.
CASS	My pleasure.
CASS	Thank you for the book.
CASS	Sorry I'm late.
JOHN	Cass?
CASS	John. Hi.
CASS	Ooh! Scared me.
JOHN	Cass, what are you doing here?
CASS	I have a meeting. What about you?
JOHN	I thought I told you, I give tennis lessons over midterm.
CASS	I wonder where Mary is.
JOHN	Mary?
CASS	Yeah, she's giving me a sample plan for the coursework.
JOHN	But I dropped her at the airport yesterday.
CASS	What? But I texted her. She said to meet her here.
CASS	That's not like her.
CASS	The message is gone.
CASS	That's weird.
JOHN	Well, could it have been an old message?
CASS	Maybe.
CASS	I could have sworn she texted me back.
CASS	I guess I am losing my mind.
JOHN	Hey, listen, I do things like that all the time.
CASS	Do you?
JOHN	Well, no, not really.
CASS	Yeah, I figured.
CASS	I guess I shouldn't be surprised, I've been very off.
CASS	Have you heard about the murder?
JOHN	You know, I used to play tennis with her.
JOHN	I couldn't believe it when I heard the news, I felt terrible.
JOHN	Still do.
CASS	Yeah. I didn't know you knew her. I did too.
JOHN	Then you know how sweet she was.
CASS	I really hope they find who did it soon.
CASS	Did you know her husband?
JOHN	Just a bit.
JOHN	Truth be told, he always struck me as a bit weird.
JOHN	Look, I've gotta get to my lesson. Can I walk you out?
CASS	Yeah, sure.
CASS	How do you mean? You said her husband's weird?
JOHN	Well, he didn't like Jane and I playing tennis together.
JOHN	That's why we stopped.
JOHN	She did anything she could to please him.
CASS	So, you're off to Greece soon.
JOHN	No, not anymore. (sighs)
CASS	Oh, why?
JOHN	Let's just say my girlfriend is no longer on the scene.
CASS	Oh. I'm sorry.
JOHN	Hey, these things happen.
JOHN	Look, I've got to get over to the courts.
JOHN	Even though the kid cheats like mad and there's nothing I detest more.
JOHN	But can we get a drink later?
JOHN	It might be nice to commiserate together about Jane.
CASS	Oh. Matthew is going out of town. Sure, yeah. Drink sounds nice.
JOHN	Great. See you then.
CASS	See you then.
CASS	Hey, are you coming? You on your way?
CASS	Why?
RACHEL	This client dinner is running late and driving me also insane.
RACHEL	Sorry.
CASS	No, no. There's nothing you can do, it's fine.
RACHEL	Are you going to be okay?
CASS	Of course I'll be fine. (phone beeping)
RACHEL	Turn all the lights on. Open ice cream.
CASS	That's Matthew. Let me call you back.
RACHEL	Okay.
CASS	Hi, babe.
MATTHEW	Hey, babe. There's a problem I'm working on.
MATTHEW	Um... is Rachel with you?
CASS	Uh... Not yet.
CASS	Uh, go to your problem. I'll be fine. Um...
CASS	I'll talk to you later.
CASS	I love you.
CASS	Hello?
CASS	Hello?
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
CASS	Mom?
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
CASS	It's okay.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass.
CASS	Who's there?
DISPATCHER	Emergency...
CASS	Hello? (clatter continues)
CASS	There's someone in my house. Please send someone quick.
CASS	14 Old River Road.
CASS	Please come fast!
DC LAWSON	I'm at the Anderson residence.
OFFICER	You sure?
DC LAWSON	Yeah, we checked the whole house, there's no one there.
DC LAWSON	No broken glass, nothing.
DC LAWSON	Did you get the background report from Gordon?
MAN	Yes. Two years ago Cass Anderson was admitted to the psych ward at Houghton Moor Hospital.
DC LAWSON	A psych ward?
OFFICER	Yeah.
DC LAWSON	Listen, we need to keep an eye on them.
DC LAWSON	I'm not quite sure what, but something's off there.
DC LAWSON	Uh-huh.
DC LAWSON	Got it.
JOHN	So, did you recognize the voice?
CASS	They asked me that.
CASS	Something about it sounded familiar.
JOHN	What's Matthew say? Did he come back?
CASS	No, he can't come back right away. He's with a group on a rig.
JOHN	Get rid of him.
JOHN	I'm joking, Cass.
CASS	I know.
JOHN	I'm just joking.
CASS	I know.
JOHN	A rig?
CASS	Yeah, he's with British Energy Partners.
CASS	He has to make a lot of site visits.
CASS	It would be one thing if I was in the hospital, but it's not easy going to and from an oil rig, so he's coming back as planned.
JOHN	Gotcha.
CASS	I don't know what to think of yesterday. It doesn't make any sense.
CASS	Something about it feels connected to Jane.
JOHN	Jane?
CASS	I don't know, probably not.
CASS	Maybe it's Andrew.
JOHN	Andrew Manning, from school?
CASS	I think he has a bit of a crush.
CASS	He came by my house the other day.
JOHN	Really?
CASS	Yeah. I gave him a book to read over the break and he brought it back.
CASS	Probably harmless, but it was strange.
JOHN	Well, 15-year-old boys are generally strange.
CASS	He said Harry Freeman lives one street over from me and that's who told him where I live.
JOHN	Well, Harry Freeman doesn't live near you.
CASS	How do you know?
JOHN	Because he lives near me on the other side of town. I know his mum.
JOHN	We were schoolmates.
CASS	That's weird.
CASS	No, they're not just nuisance calls.
CASS	There's definitely someone there, it feels very personal.
CASS	Like something a 15-year-old kid would do.
CASS	This was so nice.
JOHN	Yeah. Really enjoyed it. Thanks.
CASS	No, thank you so much for coming all the way out here.
JOHN	Any time.
CASS	You want to see the pool? It's really beautiful.
CASS	It's just right over there.
JOHN	Can do.
CASS	I'm sorry.
JOHN	It's okay.
JOHN	Look, I better, um... better go as well.
CASS	Yeah.
CASS	Thank you again.
JOHN	Any time.
CASS	Okay.
JOHN	Okay.
MATTHEW	Oh.
MATTHEW	That looks good.
CASS	Thank you.
MATTHEW	Hi.
CASS	Hi.
CASS	Tough week?
MATTHEW	Mm. I guess you could say that. Not as tough as yours.
CASS	None of it makes any sense.
MATTHEW	I don't know... who was that or what was that?
CASS	I don't know.
MATTHEW	Babe, are you still taking pills?
MATTHEW	I mean, the ones you started when your mom died.
CASS	Only the sleeping ones. Why?
MATTHEW	I don't know.
MATTHEW	Side effects, I mean some of those drugs cause hallucinations.
CASS	This wasn't a hallucination.
CASS	Jesus.
MATTHEW	I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.
MATTHEW	It's been one thing after another recently.
MATTHEW	I mean... what happened at the house and...
CASS	What's your point?
MATTHEW	Hey. Never... never mind. I'm sorry.
MATTHEW	We're here now.
MATTHEW	All right?
MATTHEW	Let's just enjoy it.
MATTHEW	To us.
CASS	To us in our suite.
MATTHEW	Yes, in our very nice hotel suite.
MATTHEW	Oh. Such a shame.
CASS	Mm. The bed is massive.
MATTHEW	Not so massive that you'll lose me in it.
CASS	No chance.
CASS	Do you have a copy of the contract for the alarm that I apparently signed?
CASS	You don't think I'd actually have done that without you, do you?
MATTHEW	All I know is that when I got there this morning, there's a technician waiting outside.
MATTHEW	He said his boss and you set today as the installation, but then there was nobody there when he got there.
CASS	I decided nothing. I told them we'd get back to them.
MATTHEW	But you signed a contract.
CASS	I did no such thing.
MATTHEW	See, that's what I thought. But then he showed me a copy.
CASS	Can I see it?
MATTHEW	Yeah, I'll show it to you later. Can we just enjoy the night?
CASS	Yeah, okay.
MATTHEW	Yeah.
MATTHEW	Okay, we'll sort it out.
CASS	Okay.
MATTHEW	Shit. Stabbing somebody's one thing, but slitting their throat with a massive knife, that's just sick.
CASS	Matthew!
MATTHEW	What? It was just on the news. That's how she died.
MATTHEW	Hey, Cass, will you calm down?
CASS	How am I supposed to calm down if you won't stop going on and on about it?
CASS	I am sick of hearing about it.
MATTHEW	I have not been going on about it.
MATTHEW	That's the first time I said anything.
MATTHEW	I'll get it.
DC LAWSON	Hi.
MATTHEW	Hi.
DC LAWSON	I'm just checking on Mrs. Anderson. Any more disturbances?
CASS	Thank you so much. No, not really, no. We just got back so it's pretty quiet.
DC LAWSON	Well, I meant to ask you,
DC LAWSON	did Jane Walters ever mention her husband to you?
CASS	Yeah. Yeah. She spoke very highly of him.
DC LAWSON	Hmm. Yeah.
DC LAWSON	Did you know her as well, Mr. Anderson?
MATTHEW	Me? No, I didn't know her.
CASS	Well, you met her briefly that one time at the lunch, remember? Yeah.
DC LAWSON	What time did you get back home that night, again?
CASS	Like 11:45.
DC LAWSON	You remember it being 11:45, do you, Mr. Anderson?
MATTHEW	No, but I was asleep, so...
CASS	Oh, he was exhausted so he slept in one of the guest rooms.
DC LAWSON	A guest room?
CASS	I'm a bit of a snorer, so...
CASS	sometimes he takes solace in there.
DC LAWSON	Okay, got it.
DC LAWSON	Well, if you think of anything, you just give us a call, yeah?
MATTHEW	Yeah.
CASS	I don't feel safe there anymore.
CASS	I'm trying, but I don't know if it's possible.
CASS	I really hope they find Jane's killer soon, that would be very helpful.
CASS	Have you heard anything at work?
RACHEL	I mean, the police are there every other day, but it doesn't seem like they have any idea.
RACHEL	I'm beginning to wonder if it was just random.
RACHEL	You know, which... worries me the most.
CASS	What do you mean?
RACHEL	I... I guess like... what if it was the killer at your house?
RACHEL	I don't think I could even go back there. I think I'd have to pack up and move.
CASS	I'm honestly considering it.
RACHEL	What I'm saying is, I don't blame you.
RACHEL	What does Matthew say?
CASS	He thinks it's my medication or that I'm hallucinating.
RACHEL	You're kidding.
RACHEL	You don't have a hallucination out of the blue like that, there has to be...
RACHEL	other indications.
RACHEL	Helpful.
CASS	Yeah, I know.
CASS	Hi.
ALEX	I just really Miss Jane.
ALEX	If only she'd listened to me.
ALEX	None of this had to happen.
CASS	How do you mean?
ALEX	She didn't need that job.
ALEX	I begged her not to go back after the twins.
CASS	Lots of women like to work.
CASS	It's a balancing act.
ALEX	I know.
ALEX	I'm sure you feel the same.
CASS	Why do you think her staying home would have changed things?
ALEX	Why do you think she was out that night?
ALEX	She said she had a late meeting at the office.
CASS	Is that all she said?
ALEX	Yeah, just that.
ALEX	She ever talk to you about it?
CASS	No. Not that I remember.
ALEX	You know, sometimes I wonder if she was seeing somebody.
ALEX	There's the guy she used to play tennis with.
ALEX	I never did like him.
ALEX	I-- No, I never got that from her. She adored you and the girls.
ALEX	She was over the moon.
ALEX	I hope it's true.
MATTHEW	Oh, it's the delivery. I'll get it.
MATTHEW	Yeah. Thank you. You too. Thanks, bye.
CASS	That's weird.
CASS	The baby shop.
CASS	Yeah. I was in there the other day.
CASS	I stopped in after having lunch with Rachel.
MATTHEW	Yeah, I just got off the phone with them. They said they'd placed an order for you?
CASS	I was buying a sleeping suit for Sheila at school.
CASS	She has a new baby.
MATTHEW	What you told her, is it true?
MATTHEW	I didn't believe her at first. I thought she must be mistaken.
CASS	Is what true?
MATTHEW	Are you really pregnant?
CASS	No.
MATTHEW	Well...
CASS	I'm not pregnant.
MATTHEW	She was congratulating me, and, uh... I mean, she knew who you were.
CASS	Well, it's a mistake. She's mistaken.
MATTHEW	You know, she was pretty specific.
MATTHEW	She was very clear that you told her you were pregnant,
MATTHEW	and now there's a stroller in my kitchen.
CASS	And I never told her I'm pregnant.
CASS	She assumed it because I was shopping there, but I never ordered that.
MATTHEW	I mean, you sure you didn't order a stroller?
CASS	I don't know.
CASS	I mean, there was another couple there and we were all looking at it at the same time.
CASS	Maybe she got confused.
MATTHEW	Yeah, but you don't know for sure?
CASS	I don't think so.
MATTHEW	Sweetheart.
MATTHEW	Maybe now is a good time to talk to Dr. Deakins.
CASS	Dr. Deakins?
CASS	Why?
MATTHEW	Well, after what happened while I was away and the contract thing and this, I just...
MATTHEW	I don't think it'll do any harm to see a doctor.
MATTHEW	Just for a checkup.
CASS	You don't believe me?
DR. DEAKINS	So Matthew says you've been having trouble remembering things.
DR. DEAKINS	When did you first notice?
DR. DEAKINS	Please don't be upset.
DR. DEAKINS	It's typically the spouse who contacts us.
DR. DEAKINS	I had a look at the notes from your hospitalization.
DR. DEAKINS	There's a note here about your mother having dementia.
DR. DEAKINS	How old was she when she was diagnosed?
CASS	Fifty-five.
DR. DEAKINS	So... early onset dementia.
MATTHEW	But Cass is way too young for that.
DR. DEAKINS	Unfortunately, not necessarily.
MATTHEW	Hey.
MATTHEW	Got everything.
MATTHEW	Oh, babe.
ALEX	Cass Anderson stopped by here the other day.
ALEX	I'd completely forgotten until then.
DC LAWSON	Forgotten what?
ALEX	Jane mentioned to me someone she knew was having an affair.
ACTRESS ON TV	...that also comes with abiding by the law...
MATTHEW	Think I'm gonna head up.
MATTHEW	Got an early day tomorrow.
CASS	Okay.
CASS	I'll be up in a little bit.
ACTRESS ON TV	All I ask you is what you're feeling
ACTRESS ON TV	as a citizen, as a man of God...
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass...
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass...
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass...
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass...
CASS	Matthew!
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass...
GHOSTLY FEMALE VOICE	Cass...
CASS	Matt!
CASS	Matt?
CASS	Matt?
CASS	Matt?
MATTHEW	You're calling me? What's going?
CASS	There's a knife.
MATTHEW	Where? What knife?
CASS	Well, look.
CASS	What? No, no.
MATTHEW	What?
CASS	No, it was right here, just now. It was right here!
CASS	I promise, there was a knife.
CASS	There was a knife here. And then the TV...
MATTHEW	Maybe it's just one of those things--
CASS	And there's a woman saying my name.
MATTHEW	So wait, the woman on the TV?
CASS	No, no, no, in the house. Didn't you hear her?
MATTHEW	I didn't hear a thing. Shall we call the cops?
CASS	Why would we call the cops? They'll do nothing...
MATTHEW	Babe, come on.
CASS	I'm not making it up. (sobbing) I promise, I'm not making it up.
MATTHEW	No, I know, I know, I know.
CASS	I'm... I'm not crazy.
MATTHEW	I don't get it. I just don't understand.
CASS	It was right here.
MATTHEW	All right. What? What?
MATTHEW	Please, consider taking the prescription from the doctor, please.
CASS	It was right...
CASS	And there was a woman and she was saying my name.
MATTHEW	No, no...
MATTHEW	It's just the stress.
MATTHEW	Really, really.
CASS	I'm not crazy.
MATTHEW	I'm not sure I understand. I wanna understand.
CASS	I'm really not that crazy.
MATTHEW	Come on, I know, I know. Come on.
MATTHEW	Come on, we can...
MATTHEW	Hey, babe. It's me. Maybe you're asleep or in the shower, I'll call you back.
MATTHEW	Oh, thank God.
MATTHEW	You okay?
MATTHEW	You took too many pills.
CASS	No.
CASS	I didn't take an overdose.
DOCTOR	Try to stay calm, Mrs. Anderson.
CASS	I took only two pills today, I swear.
MATTHEW	Cass.
MATTHEW	Hey.
MATTHEW	You all right?
CASS	I must have fallen asleep.
MATTHEW	It's okay.
MATTHEW	But remember, Dr. Deakins said to try to get on a regular sleep schedule.
CASS	Yeah. Did you call Mary?
MATTHEW	Yes.
CASS	Did you tell her it's because of food poisoning I missed the test?
MATTHEW	Yes, that's exactly what I said.
MATTHEW	She's fine, so you don't have to worry.
CASS	Thank you.
MATTHEW	Hey, you want to eat? You hungry?
CASS	Little bit, yeah.
MATTHEW	I'm gonna run out for Chinese.
CASS	Don't they just deliver?
MATTHEW	Yeah, but when we call, it always takes forever and it's cold.
MATTHEW	I'll just get our usual order, right? Be right back.
CASS	Wait, Matthew.
MATTHEW	What?
CASS	You forgot your phone.
MATTHEW	Thanks. I'm gonna need that.
MATTHEW	See you soon.
CASS	Did you see that?
DC LAWSON	What?
CASS	The lights, the lights, they were-- they were flickering and buzzing like crazy.
CASS	You saw it, right?
DC LAWSON	No, I didn't see anything.
CASS	You didn't see the lights? They were flickering and they were-- the whole thing was buzzing.
DC LAWSON	No, no, I didn't see anything.
CASS	Okay.
DC LAWSON	Okay.
CASS	Sorry.
DC LAWSON	Are you okay?
CASS	It's just my mom.
DC LAWSON	Your mom?
CASS	My mom visited me.
DC LAWSON	Your mom has passed.
CASS	I know it sounds crazy.
CASS	But she's been in touch a lot lately.
DC LAWSON	We were notified that you were in the hospital.
DC LAWSON	The report said "attempted suicide."
CASS	It wasn't that.
CASS	The emergency nurse came to her own conclusions.
DC LAWSON	How so?
CASS	Look, I've had a hard time ever since I lost my mom.
CASS	The point is, I've been on anti-anxiety medication, and with everything going on, I think I just miscalculated.
CASS	I don't think I have the nerve to actually kill myself.
DC LAWSON	That's good to hear.
DC LAWSON	I'm also here because we got another tip.
CASS	Okay.
DC LAWSON	Have you been back... to Blackwater Lane since the night that Jane was killed?
CASS	Yeah, I went to where they drop off flowers.
CASS	Who's calling in these tips?
DC LAWSON	We don't know. They're anonymous.
CASS	I probably should have told you this before, but I got out and I walked around and I... I found something.
DC LAWSON	Where did you find it?
CASS	Off the road, near the woods, somewhere in the... in the grass.
CASS	But the weird thing is, is...
CASS	I think it's mine.
DC LAWSON	It's yours?
CASS	I have a pair just like it and when I found it, I came back and I checked and one of mine is missing.
DC LAWSON	So, why didn't you call us?
CASS	Honestly, I didn't know what to do.
DC LAWSON	Is everything okay here?
CASS	Uh... (laughs softly)
CASS	What do you mean?
DC LAWSON	With you and your husband.
CASS	We're good. Why?
DC LAWSON	Well, someone mentioned that you had a close relationship with Mr. Collins.
DC LAWSON	He's a fellow teacher at your school, I think.
CASS	John?
CASS	That's absurd. He's a good friend, but nothing more.
DC LAWSON	Okay. I had to ask, you know.
DC LAWSON	I figured because, let's face it, who leaves a guy who can give you all of this
DC LAWSON	for a teacher?
DC LAWSON	No offense.
CASS	You mean my house?
CASS	Matthew had nothing to do with this. This is from my parents.
DC LAWSON	It's very nice for you. (laughs softly)
CASS	Yeah. Thanks. It is a bit of a surprise.
CASS	I mean, I...
CASS	certainly didn't want for anything growing up.
DC LAWSON	Well, I'm gonna hope for a surprise like that for me one day.
DC LAWSON	It's funny, you know, they still call it the old Crawford house.
DC LAWSON	And your friend Rachel, her name came up recently.
DC LAWSON	Is it a coincidence that her middle name is Crawford?
CASS	No. No coincidence.
CASS	Her family owned this house many years ago.
DC LAWSON	I thought there might be a connection.
DC LAWSON	So what happened?
CASS	Her grandfather was a part of some financial fraud scheme and they lost everything, including their family home.
DC LAWSON	So how does she feel about your family buying it?
CASS	She was totally tor it. She wanted our family to have it.
DC LAWSON	I guess it's kind of back in the family for her.
CASS	I like to think so.
DC LAWSON	Okay.
DC LAWSON	Thank you for your time.
DC LAWSON	I'll show myself out.
MATTHEW	You went back out in those woods and you found your earring?
MATTHEW	Why didn't you tell me this?
CASS	Didn't think anything of it. I found it and I put it in my purse.
MATTHEW	Jesus. Um...
MATTHEW	Maybe this is the wrong time, but, um, you have to read that letter from Dr. Deakins.
CASS	What letter?
MATTHEW	The one that came the other day.
CASS	I didn't see it.
MATTHEW	Well, it's on the counter with the rest of the mail that you haven't opened.
CASS	I'll go through it tomorrow.
MATTHEW	So you said the other... Uh...
MATTHEW	Listen, um, the thing is...
CASS	What?
MATTHEW	I read the letter from the doctor.
CASS	You opened my mail?
MATTHEW	Just that one, and only because you weren't dealing with it.
MATTHEW	What if he wanted to see you again or... change your medication or something?
CASS	You had no right. Where is it?
MATTHEW	Where you left it.
CASS	There you have it.
MATTHEW	Look, I...
MATTHEW	I think he just wants to refer you for some tests.
CASS	Mm-hmm.
CASS	I hope so.
MATTHEW	I'll spend the night.
MATTHEW	Coming up?
CASS	Mm-hmm.
CASS	I'll be right there.
MATTHEW	Okay.
MATTHEW	Okay.
DC LAWSON	Hi. This is DC Lawson.
DC LAWSON	I'm investigating a murder in Houghton Moor and there's a person of interest who attended university there.
DC LAWSON	Anything you can tell me would be very much appreciated.
CASS	Hi, my name is Cass Anderson.
CASS	We recently had an alarm installed.
CASS	Would it be possible for you to e-mail me a copy of the contract?
CASS	I seem to have misplaced it.
CASS	Yeah. Cass Anderson. Anderson.
CASS	Mm-hmm.
SUSIE	So, how about a cup of tea?
CASS	A cup of tea sounds nice. Thank you.
SUSIE	I'm so glad you came by.
SUSIE	So how are you?
CASS	I'm okay.
CASS	Still upset about Jane, as I'm sure you are too.
SUSIE	It's still so hard to believe.
SUSIE	I've been helping Alex out with the kids here and there.
CASS	That's really sweet. Rachel mentioned you knew him.
SUSIE	We were all members at the same club.
CASS	Can I ask you something?
SUSIE	Sure, what?
CASS	Did Jane have any work friends?
SUSIE	Definitely. Her best friend was Kelly Duffy.
SUSIE	She's in accounting.
CASS	I'd love to talk to her. Would you introduce me?
CASS	I could have Rachel introduce me.
SUSIE	Oh, hell no, don't ask Rachel.
CASS	What?
SUSIE	Do not mention Kelly to Rachel.
CASS	Why?
SUSIE	You know what? Let's make it wine instead of tea.
SUSIE	I'll tell you, as long as you promise not to tell anyone.
SUSIE	Most of all, Rachel.
CASS	You have my word.
SUSIE	She had an affair with Kelly's husband a couple of years ago.
SUSIE	They ended up divorcing.
CASS	What? I can't believe it. Rachel would never do that.
SUSIE	Well, believe it because it's true.
SUSIE	They used to go away to Italy together all the time.
CASS	She loves Italy. She was going every other weekend a while back.
SUSIE	He used to tell Kelly he had to go for business.
SUSIE	One week she followed him there.
CASS	So... Rachel and Jane definitely knew about each other.
CASS	What?
OFFICER	Mrs. Anderson. You called to report an accident.
CASS	Um, actually not an accident. Someone tried to run me off the road.
CASS	I actually can't believe there's not more damage.
MATTHEW	Was it really necessary to call the police?
CASS	Yeah, it needs to be documented.
CASS	Sorry, Officer, I was too busy trying not to be run off the road to get a license plate, but...
OFFICER	Can you tell me the make and model of the car?
CASS	Yeah, it was a big black SUV with blacked out windows.
MATTHEW	You sure it wasn't somebody just trying to pass? The road's dark, people are aggressive.
CASS	I'm pretty sure I know someone wasn't trying to pass.
CASS	Look at my car.
MATTHEW	You don't remember? That happened last week.
MATTHEW	The delivery truck. I asked you to back up.
MATTHEW	That's old damage.
MATTHEW	I'm sorry, Officer.
MATTHEW	Um, my wife sometimes has trouble with her memory.
CASS	No.
CASS	No, this has nothing to do with my memory.
CASS	I think I would know if someone was running me off the road.
MATTHEW	Thank you for your time.
CASS	You completely undermined me.
MATTHEW	Come on, Cass. It was probably just somebody trying to pass.
CASS	Thanks for the support.
MATTHEW	Look, babe, you've got signs of early onset dementia.
MATTHEW	You're sick, when are you gonna accept that?
MATTHEW	I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
CASS	Hello.
AMY	Mrs. Anderson.
CASS	Yes.
AMY	Hi, this is Amy from Castle Wells Protection Services.
AMY	I'm so sorry, but I think I gave you the wrong contract the other day.
CASS	What do you mean?
AMY	Well, when I put back the file, I found a second contract.
AMY	Did your husband sign first and then you later?
CASS	A second contract? Can... can you send me what you have?
AMY	I just emailed it to you.
CASS	Thank you. Um...
CASS	Okay, so what you just sent is the original and then what you sent me yesterday was an addendum?
AMY	It wasn't an addendum after all. It was a second contract.
AMY	Did your husband sign first and then you later?
CASS	Um... I'm not sure. What's the date on the one with my signature?
AMY	It looks like the day of installation.
CASS	But I wasn't in town that day.
CASS	Hey.
RACHEL	Hey.
CASS	Hi. Um...
CASS	I'll have a small Sauvignon blanc.
RACHEL	I'll have another rosé.
RACHEL	What's going on?
CASS	It's Matthew.
CASS	He's been...
CASS	really cold lately, and I think...
CASS	I think he's having an affair.
RACHEL	Is this a general feeling...
RACHEL	or something specific?
CASS	It's just a general feeling, but there has been a distinct shift in his attitude.
RACHEL	Thanks.
RACHEL	Well...
RACHEL	your intuition is usually spot on.
RACHEL	You should hire a private investigator.
CASS	Really?
RACHEL	Absolutely.
RACHEL	If he is, then you'll have proof. And if he isn't, then you'll know.
RACHEL	I... I have somebody great. I'll text you his info.
CASS	Of course you do.
CASS	Um...
CASS	Send me the info, I'll think about it.
RACHEL	Do it.
RACHEL	You know I've never trusted Matthew.
CASS	It's been a lot lately.
CASS	I almost wouldn't blame him.
CASS	Have you ever had one?
RACHEL	An...
CASS	An affair.
RACHEL	That's a complicated question to ask out of the blue.
CASS	Is it?
CASS	Feel like it's a... yes or no question. It's not really that complicated.
RACHEL	All affairs are not necessarily equal.
RACHEL	Look, I... I can't get into it right now.
RACHEL	Let's table it for another time when you're not...
RACHEL	in the middle of this.
RACHEL	I have to run to the bathroom.
CASS	Uh... we're okay. Thank you.
RACHEL	Legal's still expecting a set of notes from the SEC.
RACHEL	Could we... (sighs) Yeah, we could turn around by the end of business in New York, but...
RACHEL	Hold on.
RACHEL	I'm sorry. Uh, kind of an emergency came up at the office.
RACHEL	Can I abandon you?
CASS	Oh, no, no, that's fine.
RACHEL	But I do want to finish the conversation, okay?
CASS	Yeah.
RACHEL	Let's get lunch.
RACHEL	Well, it's gonna be 11 hours...
MATTHEW	Hang in there, end in sight, promise. Let me know what happens.
RACHEL	Waiting for her to arrive.
MATTHEW	We've got to end this.
RACHEL	Agreed. Now's the time.
RACHEL	We've got a problem.
RACHEL	Someone saw us.
RACHEL	I'm meeting her Friday night on Blackwater Lane.
RACHEL	I think someone may have seen me on Blackwater.
RACHEL	I recognized the car.
MATTHEW	Yeah. Are you there?
MATTHEW	Hello?
MATTHEW	Hello?
MATTHEW	Shit. Stabbing somebody's one thing, but slitting their throat with a massive knife, that's just sick.
MATTHEW	We've got to end this.
RACHEL	Agreed. Now's the time.
ANDREW	Mrs. Anderson.
ANDREW	Mrs. Anderson!
ANDREW	Please send an ambulance to 14 Old River Road.
ANDREW	I've just found my teacher. It's an emergency. Come quick!
DC LAWSON	Mr. Anderson.
DC LAWSON	I'm sorry to inform you, there's... been an incident.
MATTHEW	What's going on? Where's my wife?
ANDREW	I came to get a paper for my class.
ANDREW	I sensed something was really wrong so I... I went and looked for her.
MATTHEW	What? What are you saying?
ANDREW	She was just laid there, there was blood everywhere.
MATTHEW	Where is she?
ANDREW	She didn't make it.
MATTHEW	No.
ANDREW	They took her to the hospital.
ANDREW	I'm so... so sorry.
MATTHEW	No.
MATTHEW	She really loved this house.
MATTHEW	It was never part of the plan, Rachel.
MATTHEW	This has all gotten way out of hand.
MATTHEW	That's just the house settling.
RACHEL	Someone's here.
JOHN	Hey!
RACHEL	Walk inside, Cassie.
CASS	You have to call an ambulance for John.
RACHEL	How long have you been having an affair with John?
CASS	What?
CASS	It's not going to work, Rachel.
CASS	They have your phone.
RACHEL	That is not my phone. It's yours.
CASS	Yes, it is. It's your phone that you've been using to text my husband. Right, Matt? Right, Matt?
CASS	Why are you doing this?
RACHEL	No one is "doing this."
RACHEL	You're clearly having another breakdown.
CASS	You're unbelievable.
RACHEL	You're unwell, Cass.
RACHEL	You've never been well.
CASS	You'd want me to believe that, wouldn't you?
CASS	I knew you were competitive, but cheating with my husband?
CASS	Well...
RACHEL	Was it competitive when you bought this house to humiliate me?
CASS	You...
RACHEL	For the record, I never cheated with your husband.
CASS	What?
MATTHEW	Cass, I'm sorry. Rachel, this has to stop--
RACHEL	You don't know her like I do.
MATTHEW	We gotta stop, we gotta let her go.
RACHEL	She does not care about you. She only cares about herself, trust me.
RACHEL	With all that you inherited, did you ever think to share one penny with anyone else?
CASS	That's what this is about?
CASS	Money?
RACHEL	No, that's not how I keep score. But it's how you keep score.
CASS	That's why you're doing this?
CASS	Don't you know that if you needed anything, I would have given it to?
RACHEL	Like when we were in school, you knew.
RACHEL	You knew what was happening to me.
RACHEL	You knew what happened to my mother.
RACHEL	You knew and you never said a word.
CASS	No, Rachel, you're wrong.
CASS	My mother was helping your mother.
CASS	Of course I didn't say anything.
CASS	I didn't want to embarrass you.
CASS	All your perceived hurts.
CASS	Always trying to get revenge.
CASS	After everything my family did for you.
RACHEL	Your family has done nothing for me.
RACHEL	Your family can never hurt me again.
RACHEL	You don't touch me. You don't-- You don't touch me!
CASS	Matthew!
RACHEL	You...
RACHEL	You did this! You did this! You did this.
DC LAWSON	That's enough! (guns cocking) Back away.
RACHEL	Somebody help him.
DC LAWSON	Back away!
RACHEL	Somebody help him, somebody help him, somebody help him.
RACHEL	We were trying to restrain Cass and she got violent.
DC LAWSON	Tell me something.
DC LAWSON	You and Matthew have known each other for a very long time, haven't you?
DC LAWSON	Since university?
DC LAWSON	You took some computer science course, and he was a teaching assistant.
DC LAWSON	But Cass didn't take that class.
DC LAWSON	She never even met Matthew until after her mother had passed.
DC LAWSON	But you orchestrated their meeting at the expert event.
DC LAWSON	You convinced her to go. She took the bait.
DC LAWSON	I'm charging you for the murder of Jane Walters, but I'm guessing there'll be a few more charges to follow.
RACHEL	On what evidence? I was in New York.
DC LAWSON	I pulled the flight manifests. You never went to New York.
DC LAWSON	And Matthew's never worked a day on a rig.
CASS	You killed Jane.
CASS	Thank you.
CASS	In the end, John ended up being okay, but Matthew didn't make it.
CASS	He died that night.
CASS	And Rachel finally admitted to everything.
CASS	They had known each other for years,
CASS	and shortly after my breakdown, Rachel and Matthew met
CASS	and a plan ensued to make me think and look
CASS	like I had early onset dementia, like my mother...
CASS	which would drive me to suicide.
CASS	All was going to plan until Jane saw them in the office
CASS	and then met Matthew with me at lunch.
CASS	But...
CASS	Rachel, ever resourceful,
CASS	decided to kill Jane...
CASS	and then make me look like a suspect.
CASS	But I sensed the deception
CASS	and Matthew was a bit too thrilled to share with me Dr. Deakins' theory about early onset dementia.
CASS	They cruelly used the experiences I was having with my mother, who passed away.
CASS	I started to realize I'd been in danger all along.
CASS	And then I found the camera and I decided to turn the tables.
CASS	I came up with a plan.
CASS	I called John and DC Lawson and enlisted Andrew to help too.
CASS	I needed someone who could give the performance of their life.
CASS	I knew Matthew and Rachel would be watching.
CASS	And I knew they'd come back for the knife and the phone.
DC LAWSON	Mr. Anderson... I'm sorry to inform you, there's been an incident.
CASS	What's scary is, they could have pulled it off.
CASS	I'm so sorry about Jane.
CASS	Even after all this, I miss Rachel.
CASS	Who we were together, all the laughs and cries.
CASS	I even miss Matthew.
CASS	Even after discovering he never loved me.
CASS	This was a plan they had from the very beginning.
CASS	At the end of the day, I found that three things are certain.
CASS	If you listen, the answers are there.
CASS	Everything happens when it's supposed to.
CASS	And you are so much stronger than you think.
