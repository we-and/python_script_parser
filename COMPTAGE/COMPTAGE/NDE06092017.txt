MAN (VO) 		(on phone) Yup. All right. 

YUPPIE		(on phone) Just hold on a second. (to Jay) Look, man, is there any way we can speed this up? I'm really, really in a rush.

DAVID 		Hey, Jay, I'm good. You know, I'm tryin’ to avoid assholes like that. What about you?

JAY			Tryin’ to avoid assholes like that. You know how it goes. 

DAVID 		(overlapping) (laughs) 

JAY			Uh, this is yours. 

DAVID 		One thing. Do not tell my wife about this, okay? 

JAY			Promise, our secret.

DAVID 		Good to see you, Jay.

ISABEL 		(VO) 	(on voicemail) (in Spanish accent) Hey, babe. Just calling to let you know that we got here safe and we’re waiting for you to get home. Someone is excited to hear from you! 

DAVID 		(chuckles) I love those guys. 

SAVANNA 		(on Skype) Hi, Daddy. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) Hello. So, how do you like Mexico so far? 

SAVANNA 		(on Skype) I kinda miss home. Well, I also miss you, too, Daddy. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) Oh, baby, it’s okay. Come on. You’re there to see Grandma and Grandpa. It’s their wedding anniversary. And you know how much you love the ocean. 

ISABEL 		(on Skype) That’s what I told her. 

SAVANNA 		(on Skype) Oh, and when we got here, I lugged the big bags all by myself. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) Really? Show me those muscles. Look at that! Strong like Daddy.

ISABEL 		(on Skype) No, you mean strong like Mommy. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) Yeah, yeah, I know. 

ISABEL 		(on Skype) Are you eating Jay’s?

DAVID 		(on Skype) Mm-hmm. 

ISABEL 		(on Skype) Mm. You know you’re not supposed to eat that.

SAVANNA 		(on Skype) Yeah, she’s right. You’re not supposed to be eating that, Daddy. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) Hold on. Jay’s from the Bronx. And Chinese? Bronx-Chinese. It doesn’t get better than that. 

ISABEL 		(on Skype) (laughs) I don’t wanna hear any complainings when you get sick. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) I'm not gonna get sick. Watch. Mm.

ISABEL 		(on Skype) Mm-hmm. We’ll see. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) (laughs) 

ISABEL 		(on Skype) So, how did it go today? 

DAVID 		(on Skype) You know, well they invited me to take the black belt two. 

ISABEL 		(on Skype) Those are great news, babe. So, my executive badass. 

DAVID 		Very funny. 

ISABEL 		(on Skype) Is there any way you can get here any earlier? I mean, two weeks is a long time. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) Well, just by chance I did close the Kovash deal today, so I think it might have bought me some good will. I'm gonna be there in four days my babe.

ISABEL 		(on Skype) Okay, babe. I’ll let you get back to your daughter while I get ready for bed. How’s that? Love you. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) (overlapping) Okay. I love you so much. 

ISABEL 		(on Skype) I love you, honey. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) So, honey, Daddy’s gonna come right back. Just give me a second, okay? 

SAVANNA 		(on Skype) Where are you going?

DAVID  		(on Skype) Daddy’s just gonna grab a glass of wine, sweetie.

SAVANNA 		(on Skype) Wine? Really? You’re not supposed to be drinking wine. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) Is that right, little lady?

ISABEL 		(to Savanna) Don’t give him such a hard time. I'm sure he earned it. 

DAVID 		(on Skype) See? Just one glass, but Daddy did earn this. Mm. So, I have an idea because I'm gonna be there early, I was thinking that we could ride Mommy’s horses together.

GABRIEL 		Hello, Savanna.

DAVID 		(VO) (on Skype) What the fuck are you doing? 

SAVANNA 		(overlapping) (screams)

DAVID 		Yes, she’s in, uh, she’s in Mexico, was in her parents. I saw an attack. It was a video call. 

STEVENS 		Do you mind if I check you? 

DAVID 		Of course you can, but is that necessary?

STEVENS 		Just procedure, sir. 

DAVID 		(overlapping) (sighs deeply) 

STEVENS 		Put your hands behind your back for me. Spread your feet apart. A little wider. 

DAVID 		(sighs deeply repeatedly) 

STEVENS 		Lean back. So, this alleged that you supposedly witnessed, how were you able to do that, since it took place in Mexico?

DAVID 		I’ve already explained this. I was on a video call. The guy showed up and hurt my wife and my child. I saw everything. 

STEVENS 		Okay, so you saw this attack on a video chat. 

DAVID 		Yes.

OFFICER JONES 		Mr. Miller, would you give me a moment? 

DAVID 		Of course. (to Officer Stevens) That’s what happened, okay? I was on a video call.

OFFICER JONES 		(on radio) Dispatch, I'm with a gentleman who said he witnessed a two-seventeen. 

DISPATCH 		(on radio) Copy that. Everything okay?

OFFICER JONES 		(on radio) Yeah. He said he witnessed the attack via video chat.

DISPATCH 		(on radio) I'm sorry, can you repeat?

OFFICER JONES 		(on radio) Witnessed attack via video call. The attack happened in Mexico. I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. 

OFFICER JONES 		(on radio) Copy that.

DAVID 		Bella, where are you?

BELLA		(on phone) (in Spanish accent) At the apartment (voice breaks) waiting for Daddy to come. The police is here. Uh, but my God, David, what’s going on? (breathes shakily) (exhales sharply) 

DAVID 		(on phone) Bella, do you know anything?

BELLA		(on phone) (voice breaks) No! There’s police everywhere, and then they said that there’s a detective on his way.

MEXICAN 		(speaks Spanish) 

BELLA 		(on phone) (grunts) Uh. David, hol- hold on a second. (softly, to Mexican Officer #1) Yeah?

MEXICAN		(speaks Spanish) 

BELLA 		(softly) Okay. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO	(in Spanish accent) Senorita Barabas, soy Dectivo Romero.  

BELLA		(speaks Spanish) Isabel is my sister. (on phone) Uh-uh, D- David, can you hold on a second, please? (to Detective Romero) Uh, I have my brother-in-law on the phone. He witnesses the attack. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Can I speak with him?

BELLA		(on phone) David, I'm just gonna pass it on, okay? (to Detective Romero) Sure. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(to Bella) Hey. I may want to ask you a few questions when I'm finished please. 

BELLA			(in shaky voice) Sure. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) Mr. Miller. This is Detective Romero. Were you on the phone with your wife?

DAVID 		(on phone) Not on the phone. I was on my laptop on a video call. I saw everything. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) You saw the attacker?

DAVID 		(on phone) Detective, I'm happy to answer your questions, but please can you tell me is my family okay? 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) Your wife and- and daughter are not in the apartment. There’s no blood. No sign of forced entry. The bags, they are still here. It wasn’t a robbery. At this point, it leads me to believe that it was a kidnapping, in which case they will have to be kept alive because it becomes a- a business transaction. 

DAVID 		(on phone) What do you mean a transaction- business transaction? I saw him beat my wife until she couldn’t--

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(overlapping) (on phone) I understand what you- you must be going through right now, and, uh, I need to know when- when you will get here. It will be very important for you to be here in country. 

DAVID 		(on phone) I already booked my flight, American Airlines. It leaves in the morning. I’ll be there two p.m. local time. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) I'm going to give you my cell number. I want you to call me the moment you arrive, please. 

DAVID 		(on phone) I’ll be there in the afternoon. I’ll call you as soon as I get there. (breathes shakily…) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) Hello?

DAVID 		(on phone) Yeah, Detective, it’s David. I just got here.

DETECTIVE ROMERO	(on phone) Oh, good. Can I send a car to collect you?

DAVID 		(on phone) No, no, I'm good. I just jumped in a cab. I'm gonna head straight to the apartment. I’ll call you as soon as I get there.

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) No, no, no, you can’t do that. Hello? David?

DAVID 		(inhales) 

CAB DRIVER #1	Where are we headed, sir?

DAVID 		Sir, yeah, Five-fifty, uh, Masaryk por favor, thank you. 

CAB DRIVER #1	You here on business? 

DAVID 		No. 

CAB DRIVER #1	Well, if you’re here on vacation, I know a couple of spots with some beautiful women. (speaks Spanish) 

DAVID 		I'm actually here to see my family. Thank you. 

CAB DRIVER #1	Well, if you need anything, you know, just, uh-- 

DAVID 		(overlapping) Excuse me, I got a call. (on phone) Hello? 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) David? You can’t go to the apartment. It’s a- it’s a crime scene.

DAVID 		(on phone) Detective, I'm going straight to the apartment, okay? I- I- I need answers and I need to see this for myself. Okay?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) Please. Come to the precinct. I know you want answers, and, uh, we can go over stuff here. 

DAVID 		(on phone) Yeah, I know, I have it. Central District, right? (to Cab Driver #1) Senor?

CAB DRIVER #1	Yeah? 

DAVID 		The police station in the Central District, do you know where that is? 

CAB DRIVER #1	Yeah. 

DAVID 		Can we go there, please?

CAB DRIVER #1	Yeah. 

DAVID 		(on phone) I’ll be there as soon as I can. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) Great. I’ll see you here. (exhales) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(sighs) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(CONT’D) (speaks Spanish)	Mr. Miller. I'm Detective Romero. 

DAVID 		(exhales) It’s good to meet you, sir. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	I wish it was under different circumstances. 

DAVID 		Of course. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Please. 

DAVID 		Thank you. 

PRISONER 		(speaks Spanish) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(to Officer) (speaks Spanish) (to David) David, please. (sighs) 

DAVID 		Is here okay?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Yes, right there, please. 

DAVID 		(breathes heavily) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	How was your journey?

DAVID 		Long.

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Can I get you something to drink? Uh, water or coffee?

DAVID 		Actually, I'm okay, thank you. I- I-- Truthfully, I’d rather just, uh, get on with things if that’s okay. I wondered if there was any more information, news, leads, anything?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Uh… not yet, but- but when the forensics on the crime scene come back short- coming in shortly. David… I want you to tell me again the first thing that you remember. 

DAVID 		His voice.

DAVID 		So, is it- is it- is it normal for- for a kidnapper to take a woman and a child, beat them half to death? I mean, what use are they to anybody if they’re dead? (sighs) Is it normal? 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	At times, yes. To prevent resistance. You know how many ransom kidnappings we have here? We have a lot more experience at this than you do, David. Now, you’re very upset. Please. Try to sit down and relax. Please?

DAVID 		(sighs) 

DAVID		It’s just the way… he looked at me.	With such hatred. He- he- he- he knew me. He knew my name. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Mm-hmm. 

DAVID 		It felt so personal. It was like-- It was as if he was en- enjoying some kind of sick game like a challenge.

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Mm-hmm. You wife is the daughter of a very wealthy businessman. She’s a national treasure. High profile and money. This is a- a- a kidnapper’s dream, David. So, there are some, uh, some procedural things that are left to do, oh, about an hour or so, so while we prepare those please go get some air. It’s been a very long day for you, okay? I think we’ve done enough for now. 

DAVID 		(on phone) Ten minutes? Yeah, perfect. Yeah, same place. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(overlapping) (to Officer) (speaks in foreign language) 

DAVID 		(overlapping) Okay, great, thanks.

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	David, I, uh, I want you to have this. It’s a local phone with all the- the numbers, my- my contacts. I wanna be able to reach you, uh, immediately for something.

DAVID 		Okay, wonderful. Thank you. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Do you need a ride?

DAVID 		Uh, cab’s on the way.

DAVID (CONT’D) 	Thank you, Detective. Thank you very much. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	We find them. 

DAVID 		Good night. 

CAB DRIVER #1	Ten pesos. Hey, you sure you wanna stay here? It’s- it’s no good here, man. It’s dangerous.

DAVID 		It’s perfect. But thanks, huh? Keep it.

ISABEL 		(cries softly…) 

DAVID 		Hey, thanks for getting my stuff, huh?

BELLA 		Hey, no problem. We hadn’t heard from you in hours, and got worried. 
	
DAVID 		I'm sorry. I just lost track of time, that’s all. (sighs deeply) Did the detective call you?

BELLA 		No. I called him. 

DAVID 		Okay. 

BELLA 		He told me you left your stuff at the station and he gave me this number to reach you. 

DAVID 		Okay. Thanks. 

BELLA 		David? Are you sure you won’t stay with us? 

DAVID 		Yeah, I'm okay. You know how your father is.

BELLA 		Yeah. (sighs) 

BELLA			David, what exactly happened? 

DAVID 		He hurt her. He hurt her badly. I don’t even know if he has my baby. 

DAVID 		Is there anything in her life before I met her that you guys didn’t tell me about? Anything at all? 

BELLA 		David, before she met you her life was riding. I mean, after winning the Gold at the Olympics. 

DAVID 		Well, what about, I don’t know, ex- ex-boyfriends, stalkers, fans, anything? 

BELLA 		No. Not that I remember, I mean just typical fans and people who were inspired by her and-- 

DAVID 		I know. 

BELLA 		(inhales) Wait. We still have boxes of fan letters at home. 

DAVID 		Well, can we get them?

BELLA 		Mm-hmm. Sure. 

DAVID 		Hi, there. Do you have a room, please? 

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	(speaks Spanish) (in Spanish accent) Two hundred pesos. In advance. 

DAVID 		Thank you. 

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST 	If you need any company. 

DAVID 		Have a good night. Which way? Thank you. 

DAVID 		(grunts) (exhales) 

GABRIEL 		(whispers) Mommy and Daddy don’t care about you anymore. 

SAVANNA 		(cries softly) 

GABRIEL 		You’re okay now. 

SAVANNA 		(gasps) (whimpers) 

GABRIEL 		Why are you afraid of me?

SAVANNA 		(cries softly…) 

GABRIEL 		For that, you don’t get… A good parent knows what to do! 

DAVID 		(sighs) 

DAVID 		 (exhales) (sighs deeply)

DAVID 		(softly) Oh my God. (breathes heavily…) 

DAVID 		 (under his breath) Fuck. Shit. (breathes heavily…) 

OSCAR 		(in Spanish accent) Can I come in? 

DAVID 		Of course, sir. 

OSCAR 		What are you doing, David?

OSCAR 		How is… all this helping? 

DAVID 		I don’t know if it is. 

OSCAR 		What do you mean?

DAVID 		(whispers) I gotta do something. (sighs) (softly) It wasn’t- it wasn’t			 a kidnapping. 

OSCAR 		How can you be so sure?

DAVID 		(voice breaks) The way he- he hurt her. (voice breaks) He hurt her so bad. (cries…) (softly) He hurt her so bad. 

OSCAR 		You know my family. We love you. You are like a son for u-- 

DAVID 		(overlapping) I know that. (whispers) I know that.

OSCAR 		Do-- 

OSCAR 		Do you think they are-- Do you think they are still alive? 

DAVID 		(whispers) I don’t know. (sniffles) (sniffles) (exhales) (sniffles) 

OSCAR 		I gave her one like this the first time she competed. 

OSCAR 		She’s my baby, David. If you find him… you tell me. 

DAVID 		(sniffles) You know I’ve always admired you as a father. The way you supported her. You find him… you kill him... I never see my baby again. 

OSCAR 		Good luck, son. 

DAVID 	 (on voicemail) Detective, this is David. I’ve been tryin’ to reach you all night. I’ve got some important information. Meet me at address One Five Zero Four Tarpatak. I’ll be there in a few hours. Please, be there.

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	No, nothing wrong. I just need to ask you, did you recently…  (to Alma) I’ll be right there. David, why are we here?

DAVID 		It’s him. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	You can’t be running your own investigation in my city. I want you to go across the street and wait for me. Understand? (to Officer) Make sure he stays there. 

DAVID 		(under his breath) Shit. 

ALMA 			Oh, please, please. Thank you very much. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Of course.

LILIANA		Good morning.

GABRIEL		Hello, there. 

LILIANA		How was your trip? 

GABRIEL 		It was productive. (chuckles) And it’s true what they say. That city really never sleeps. 

LILIANA 		(laughs) 

GABRIEL 		(yawns) 

LILIANA 		Uh, oh! Your grandmother called. 

GABRIEL 		Is, uh, is she okay?

LILIANA 		Yeah. She seemed fine. 

GABRIEL 		All right. I, um, I’ll call her later. Don’t- don’t let me forget. 

LILIANA 		I won’t. You have a meeting at eleven a.m. with Mr. Stevens. He wants to know what’s going on with the Anderson deal. And Mr. Thompson from KDR should be calling in soon. 

GABRIEL 		Well, thank you, Liliana. 

LILIANA 		You’re welcome. 

LILIANA		(on phone) KMI, Mr. Sanchez’ office. How can I help you?

DETECTIVE ROMERO	(on phone) Hello, this is Detective Romero.

LILIANA 		(on phone) Oh, hi, Detective. How can I help you?

GABRIEL 		(on phone) Um, look, I was, uh, looking at your investment plan, and I have to-- I'm so sorry, sir. Can you please give me one second? (over intercom) I'm assuming it must be urgent?

LILIANA 		(over intercom) There’s a Detective Romero on the other line, and he says it’s ve-- 

GABRIEL 		(on phone) Who?

GABRIEL 		(on phone) Okay. Put him through. 

GABRIEL 		(sighs) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Please, sit down.  I wanna thank you for coming 

GABRIEL 		Not a problem. I was just curious as to what this was concerning? 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Do you know Isabel Miller? 

GABRIEL		Miller? Isabel Miller? Sorry, I- I don’t recognize the name. 

GABRIEL 		(exhales) I haven’t seen this picture in ages. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	You- you recognize her?

GABRIEL 		You mean Isabel Barabas. Of course I know Isabel Barabas. Doesn’t everybody? (chuckles lightly) You know, I- I- I remember the day she won the gold. When it was announced, the room exploded. (chuckles) You remember that day, don’t you? 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Other than that, what was your relationship with her? 

GABRIEL 		Oh, no. There was, uh, no real relationship. I was, uh, more of a fan growing up. (chuckles) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	I know. I’ve been to your grandmother’s house. 

GABRIEL 		You got me. I was a big fan. She’s the reason I started riding. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Was there any other contact that you made with her? Recently?

GABRIEL 		No. What is this concerning? Did something happen to her?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Three days ago Isabel Miller and her daughter were attacked. They’ve been missing ever since. 

GABRIEL 		(whispers) My God. (softly) That’s awful. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Where were you two nights ago?

GABRIEL 		I was on my way to New York on business. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Can anyone corroborate this? 

GABRIEL 		Of course. Just check with my assistant. She took care of all the arrangements for me. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Hmm. 

GABRIEL 		I stayed at the West Hotel. Give them a call.

DETECTIVE ROMERO	Ah. It’s Liliana, correct? 

GABRIEL 		Yes. Liliana. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	You know, I hope you understand that until we can verify… this information that I need you to remain in the country. Thank you for the cooperation. 

GABRIEL 		Not a problem. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	You’re free to go. 

DAVID 		(softly) What do you mean free to go? (loudly) Hey! (yells) Hey! 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(to David) Hold on. Hold on. (speaks Spanish) 

GABRIEL 		Who is this guy?

DAVID 		What- what do you mean, “Who is this--?” (yells) You know exactly who the fuck I am! 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(speaks Spanish) (to Officer) Get him out of here! (to David) What’s wrong with you? 

DAVID 		(softly) That was him. (normal voice) I swear to God that was him. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	You saw him on a video call. 

DAVID 		(overlapping) That’s him! 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	You saw him on a video call. I'm trying to build a case. Okay, I need proof, facts. If his alibi checks out, we have nothing. 

DAVID 		Nothing- what do you mean nothing? We’re talkin’ about my- my family. (voice breaks) Do you understand me?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(sighs) I have two daughters. I understand what you must be going through. 

DAVID 		(whispers) No you don’t. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	I need more time. 

DAVID 		(whispers) Time. (softly) How much more time do they have?

DAVID 		Can I leave now? (breathes heavily) You know how to reach me. 

GABRIEL 		(breathes heavily) (grunts) 

LILIANA 		Mr. Sanchez, everything okay?

GABRIEL 		Yeah. Of course. Just, uh, stupid mistake. I was, uh, changing the, uh, spark plugs in the car, and I didn’t realize, pulled back and hit my hand. That was it. 

GABRIEL 		(to Bouncer) (unintelligible) Now you get him! 

BOUNCER		(speaks Spanish) 

GABRIEL 		(speaks Spanish) 

BAR MANAGER	This is me bar. 

GABRIEL 		Hey, stop it! Wait! 

BUS DRIVER 		(speaks Spanish) 


DAVID 		(softly) Where’s my family? (loudly) Where are they!

GABRIEL 		(unintelligible) 

ISABEL 		(cries / sniffles…) 

GABRIEL 		(overlapping) (softly) Shh. You’re safe now. 

ISABEL 		(overlapping) (sobs…)

GABRIEL 		(softly) I’ll never let him hurt you.

ISABEL 		(breathes rapidly) (cries…) 

GABRIEL 		(softly) It’s okay, my darling. 
	
ISABEL 		(sniffles) (breathes heavily) (grunts) (breathes rapidly) 

GABRIEL 		(grunts)

ISABEL 		(sobs…) (screams) Where’s my child? (sobs…) 

GABRIEL 		She’s dead. 

ISABEL 		(sobs…) 

DAVID 		What do you expect me to do? He has my family! 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(overlapping) I expect you to stay away from my case! I warned you, David. 

DAVID 		I saw him. And he ran. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	A man accused of kidnapping your family sees a crazy man come at him… who wouldn’t run? I’ve been doing this for thirty-five years, David. Do you know what it takes to make a good case in this system? So the murderer doesn’t walk out of the courtroom sticking his middle finger up at me? When I don’t have to look into the faces of the victim’s family because I failed to bring them justice? I broke promises to children because- because I acted with instinct and not enough evidence. And now you’re getting in the way of me gathering my evidence, finding your family-- 

DAVID 		(softly) What do you think I'm trying to do, huh? (voice breaks) I don’t wanna lose them. I don’t wanna lose them. (whispers) That’s all. That’s all. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	For the last time, David, you have to stay away from the case. I’ll give you two choices. You leave Mexico or you’re gonna to spend the rest of the time in one of my cells. You choose. 

DAVID 		(takes a shuddering breath) (voice breaks) It’s just that every minute feels like an hour (whispers) and I don’t know what to do. (sniffles) (whispers) I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. (sniffles) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	I promise you, I’ll do everything in my power to find your family. 

DAVID 		(inhales / exhales) (whispers) Thank you. Thank you. 

SAVANNA 		I don’t want any. Leave me alone. 

GABRIEL 		Honey, if you talk without permission, I’ll kill you. 

GANGSTER		(on phone) So you’ll bring cash. 

DAVID 		(on phone) Si, si. 

GANGSTER 		(on phone) Tomorrow is fine.

DAVID 		(on phone) Tomorrow is fine. No problem. 

GANGSTER 		(on phone) Where will you be?

DAVID 		(on phone) It’s in a bar on the corner of Revolution and Deserra. 

GANGSTER 		(on phone) You must come alone. 

DAVID 		(on phone) Uh-huh. I’ll be there. Gracias. 

GABRIEL 		(sighs) Morning. 

MR. KORDER 		(in Spanish accent) Just the man I was lookin’ for. 

GABRIEL 		Well, you found me. 

MR. KORDER		Question for you. 

GABRIEL 		Yeah?

MR. KORDER 		Have you ever been to my, uh, beach club?

GABRIEL 		Sure. 

MR. KORDER		A charity event this weekend, liquor company sponsoring, I'm hosting. Are you in? 

GABRIEL 		Am I in? What kinda question is that? Of course I'm in. 

MR. KORDER		Booze, women, what else can a man want? 

GABRIEL 		You are a wise man. 

MR. KORDER		Have your secretary call me, okay? 

GABRIEL 		Already on it. 

CLERK			Yeah?

DAVID 		(speaks inaudibly) 

CLERK			(speaks Spanish) 

DAVID 		Okay, gracias. 

CASHIER 		(speaks Spanish) 

DAVID 		Yeah. 

CASHIER 		(speaks Spanish) 

DAVID 		Gracias, senor.

CASHIER 		Gracias.

ISABEL 		(cries softly) 

GABRIEL 		Your Savanna… I spared her. But I needed to punish you. I waited for you all these years. I knew one day the time would be right for our love to fully blossom. And then you had to go betray me with that man. (inhales) (exhales deeply) I can take that mistake. We all make mistakes. But- but… that child. I can’t live with that child in this world. A bastard. 

DAVID 		Thank you for coming. Oh. It’s all there. Two-thousand dollars. 

DAVID 	 	Thank you. 

BAR MANAGER	(in Spanish accent) We are closed, puto. (sighs) (sniffles) 

BAR MANAGER 	Mr. Barabas. I, uh, I- I did not know it was you. Could I uh… could I get you a drink?

OSCAR 		Quite a mess, huh? 

BAR MANAGER	Yeah. These two guys, man, they- they busted in from nowhere. 

OSCAR 			Did you see what happened?

BAR MANAGER		(softly) Yes. (normal voice) These two guys, one gringo. 

OSCAR 			Gringo? American? 

BAR MANAGER		Yes.

OSCAR 			Bald head, tall? 

BAR MANAGER		Si. 

OSCAR 			Did you see the other one?

BAR MANAGER	He’s a little shorter, uh, dark hair, uh, just wearin’ a suit. (scoffs) He’s fucking crazy. (chuckles lightly) 

OSCAR 			Have you ever seen him before?

BAR MANAGER		No. No, sir. 

OSCAR 			Next time you see him, you call me.

OSCAR 			Is that… clear?

BAR MANAGER		Yes, Mr. Barabas. 

GABRIEL 			(on phone) Hello? Who’s this?

DAVID				(on phone) Gabriel? 

GABRIEL 			(on phone) Who is this?

DAVID 			(on phone) You know who this is.

GABRIEL	 		(on phone) What do you want?

DAVID 			(on phone) I want what’s mine.

GABRIEL 			(on phone) What’s yours? (scoffs) You got nothing. 

DAVID 	(on phone) Do me a favor, get up, look out the window, tell me what you see. 

GABRIEL 	(on phone) I see your car parked by my property. Maybe I should call the police. (grunts) 

DAVID 			It’s too late for that. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 		(sighs) (inhales) (sighs) 

OSCAR 			Peaceful, isn’t it?

OSCAR 			Welcome to my house.

OSCAR 	So, you can’t find my daughter or my granddaughter. And now you can’t find my son-in-law. What’s going on? Do you have anything? Any suspect?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 		Possibly. We brought someone in for questioning. 

OSCAR 			You mean the local executive?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Yes. But it appears he was in New York at the time, and so far his- his alibi holds up.

OSCAR 			I don’t care what it costs. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Senor Barabas, there’s been no ransom request, no contact. I don’t think this is a kidnapping anymore. 

OSCAR 	I'm gonna let you do your work because I know you’re gonna do your best. But if you don’t find them, because of something that you didn’t do…

DAVID 	You got a broken heart, huh? You and me, this bottle of wine, just the two of us, it doesn’t get better than that, does it? I’d be a bad host, wouldn’t I, if I didn’t share it? 

GABRIEL 			(grunts) Ah! 

GABRIEL 			(gags) (coughs…) 

GABRIEL 			(grunts) (groans) 

DAVID 			Good morning. 

DAVID 	Nice place. You know, see, I’ve been thinkin’ all night. You know- you know the difference, I think, between you and I? See, I think you wanna live more and you wanna see ‘em again. (chews) You know, my wife? My beautiful daughter? See, now, me, I don’t wanna live another day if I don’t. 

DAVID 			That’s funny, huh?


DAVID			 	(softly) Great. 

DAVID 			Funny, huh?

DAVID 	(overlapping) (yells) Where’s my fucking family? Where? (normal voice) Huh?

GABRIEL 			(grunts) 

ISABEL 	(cries softly…) Please. Please, please, baby. God, let me hear her voice. (voice breaks) Just let Mommy know you’re okay. (cries) (speaks Spanish) (voice breaks) Baby, please, let me know you’re okay. (sniffles) (cries…) He won’t hurt you. The bad man won’t hurt you. Just let me know you’re there. Just let me know you’re okay. (sobs) 

SAVANNA 			Mom. 

ISABEL 	(gasps) Savanna? Savanna? (sniffles) Savanna? Mommy’s here. (voice breaks) I'm here, baby. I'm here. Mommy’s gonna-- Ooh. (gasps) 

MR. KORDER			Is he in today?

LILIANA 			Uh- no, he hasn’t arrived yet. 

MR. KORDER			Did, uh, he confirm for Saturday’s event?

LILIANA 			Yes. I already checked in with your secretary. 

MR. KORDER	And I expect you to be there, as well, looking beautiful as always?

LILIANA 			(chuckles) I'm looking forward to it, sir. 

MR. KORDER			(softly) Okay. 

LILIANA 			(on phone) KMI, Mr. Sanchez’ office. How can I help you? 

DAVID 			(sighs deeply) 

GABRIEL 			(screams) 

DAVID 			(unintelligible) 

GABRIEL 			(groans…)

DAVID 	I knew the first time I saw her. I remember it so clearly. It was at a work event, a horse show. She was the guest of honor. I didn’t know anything about horses. The way she rode this powerful, magnificent animal… no fear. Just a smile, confident. She glowed. 

DAVID 	(breath hitches) I spent the rest of the afternoon tryin’ to meet her. (chuckles lightly) I shook her hand. We both knew. We both knew. We got married. 

DAVID 			She gave me a beautiful…

DAVID 			 (inhales) beautiful daughter. 

DAVID 	I held her in my arms. I remember thinking as long as I'm here she’s safe. As long as I'm alive, nothing will ever, ever happen to her. 

GABRIEL 			(inhales) You sad fuck!

DAVID 			I just want to know where my family is. 

DAVID 			(whispers) Please. 

GABRIEL 			You are… pathetic. 

DAVID 			(grunts) 

LILIANA	(on answering machine) Gabriel, it’s Liliana. Just checking in to make sure everything’s okay. Also wanted to remind you about this weekend. I know you wouldn’t miss it. Oh, I had them send you a hard copy invite. Call me back when you get this. I have the details for you. See ya. 

DAVID 			I love this movie. 

GABRIEL 			(groans) 

DAVID 	You awake? Seemed like you needed some sleep, so I thought I’d let you rest. You seen this movie? Shame. Christopher Walken, man, you gotta love that actor. Glad you’re awake, though. Got a surprise for you. 

GABRIEL 			(groans) 

DAVID 			(grunts) 

DAVID 	You know, you never know when a great idea is gonna show up. You know? I was watchin’ a movie, Deer Hunter, boom, came to me. I mean, we all know movies are bullshit, right? But, hey, De Niro, it’s different. He wanted three rounds. (chuckles) Three rounds. You’re wondering what’s inside the box, right? It’s like Christmas, huh? We’re gonna change the rules. 

GABRIEL 			(groans)

DAVID 			We’re gonna use one. 

GABRIEL 			(breathes shakily…) 

DAVID 	You wanna tell me something? Hmm? No? Okay. Ready? One, two, three. 

GABRIEL 			(overlapping) (breathes rapidly) (groans loudly) (grunts) 

DAVID 			What if the neighbors had heard that? Wait there. 

GABRIEL 			I- I…

DAVID 			Where’s my family?

GABRIEL 			(whispers) I don’t wanna die.

DAVID 			So, tell me where they are. 

GABRIEL 	I don’t… want to die. Because if I died, then I can’t look after my Isabel. 

DAVID 			Okay! 

GABRIEL 			(laughs…) (grunts) 

DAVID 			(overlapping) Okay. One, two-- 

GABRIEL 			(inhales sharply) (grunts) (breathes heavily…) 

DAVID 	You know, this game we’re playing… it’s not as much fun as I thought it would be. You know what I mean?

GABRIEL 			(inhales sharply) (groans loudly) (exhales) 

GABRIEL 			(grunts and exhales sharply…)

DETECTIVE ROMERO 		Hello?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) This is, uh, Detective Romero. Uh, there have been some new developments, and I need to ask you a few questions. So, please, call back as soon as possible. 

BELLA 		Hello, ma’am? Ma’am! (exhales sharply) I really need your help. This is really important. I'm looking for a guy who’s staying here. American. Gringo. Tall. Have you seen him at all?

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST 	No honey, I'm here every day. I haven’t seen him. 

BELLA 			(exhales) Wait- may- may I?

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	Sure.

BELLA 	Here. Take my number. Can you please call me if you see him? Any time? Take this. Thank you. 

GABRIEL 			(coughs) (wheezes) (coughs) 

DAVID 			You got an event tomorrow night to go to. 

DAVID				You’re gonna be late. I want this to stop. 

GABRIEL 			(wheezes) 

DAVID 	Just tell me where they are. My family. (voice breaks) Where are they?

GABRIEL 			(wheezes) 

DAVID 			Where is my fuckin’ family? (yells) Where’s my family?

GABRIEL 			(whispers) You will never see them again. 

DAVID 			Okay. (laughs) 

GABRIEL 			(screams…) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	I'm looking for Gabriel Sanchez. When exactly was the last time you spoke with him? 

LILIANA 	Thursday. Right before he headed home. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Is it usual for him to, uh, do a long weekend?

MR. KORDER	No. Gabriel is a workaholic. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Where did he go? 

LILIANA 			New York.

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	And how long was he there?

LILIANA 			A few days.

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	Okay. Excuse me. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) You said Gabriel Sanchez was in New York? How many days? And the hotel, uh, confirms this?

DETECTIVE ROMERO	(on phone) Look, check with Immigration. I wanna know exactly when he came back. I don’t care it’s three o’clock in the morning. Find out! Get back. 

DAVID 			Look at that. Outta smokes. And all you do is sleep. 

DAVID				Now I gotta buy some more. You need anything?

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) What? I want a group of tactical to Sanchez’ house immediately. Now! 

GABRIEL 			(grunts) (grunts loudly) (groans loudly) 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(on phone) His name is Gabriel Sanchez. He flew to New York, checked into a hotel, and then turned around the same day and came back. I'm on my way there right now. I’ve got a group of tactical meeting me. 

DETECTIVE ROMERO 	(to himself) (curses in Spanish) (on phone) I want a twenty-five mile radius. Road blocks, air support. Let’s go. 

ISABEL 			(screams) No! (cries…) 

GABRIEL	(overlapping) No more waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting. 

SAVANNA 			(overlapping) Stop! Stop! Please! Stop!

GABRIEL 			Shut the fuck up! 

ISABEL 			(cries…) 

GABRIEL 	(overlapping) No more waiting. No more waiting. No more waiting. I love you. I love you. 

ISABEL 			(cries…) 

GABRIEL 			(grunts) 

ISABEL 			(screams)

GABRIEL 			Say I love you! 

ISABEL 			No. 

GABRIEL 			(yells) (unintelligible) say I love you! 

GABRIEL 			(unintelligible) 

SAVANNA 			(overlapping) Daddy! Daddy! 

ISABEL			(gasps) 

SAVANNA 			(loudly) Daddy…! Daddy…! Daddy…!

GABRIEL 			(grunts)

DAVID 	(grunts) You will never get your filthy hands on them, do you hear me? You hear me?

GABRIEL 			(gags) (grunts) 

DAVID 			(grunts) 

ISABEL			(cries) 

DAVID 			(grunts…) 

SAVANNA 			(voice breaks) Daddy. I miss… (sniffles) 

DAVID 			(breathes heavily) 

GABRIEL 			(breathes heavily…) 

DAVID 			Remember this game we played? It was all about chance. 

GABRIEL 			(breathes heavily) 

DAVID 			Fuck chance. 

GABRIEL 			(groans)
