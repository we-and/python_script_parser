NOLA	In Seventh Grade I woke up one morning and these Tiny Mounds were occupying my chest, I pinched and poked but they wouldn’t go away. Overnight, just like that, Life got complicated by half a pound of flesh. These.

NOLA	School I was tormented, yea, teased by Rashaad Decker, a horny little  Punk half my size but his words cut like a Knife. He could read me Raw in seconds and make me Feel Naked and ashamed of my Body in front of the entire Class. The  Humiliation was like a dark Keloid growing around my wound. Everyday I’d go Home in Tears and everyday my Moms would say.

NOLA	Of course, I know that, I get it, I’m not Fuckin’ dense.

SEPTIMA 	“Face him down Nola, Words can’t hurt you, so don’t give’em that Power.”

NOLA	But Today, I have something to say to Lateef and those other Bishes. Watch out!

NOLA	I feel violated!

MARS	This is some bold..bold Ass Shit. Straight up disrespeckful. Y’know what dis means?

NOLA	What!?

MARS	Who ever this Nigga is, he’s tryin’ to park in ya Spot, squat in your Crib, get in your Head.

NOLA	What kinda Dumbass would do this?

MARS	I don’t know but I’m gonna find out, ‘cuz dis here is War.

NOLA	I feel Sick.

MARS	Hey. Hey. Nola. Nola. Nola! 

NOLA	What?!

MARS	Don’ worry. I tol’ ya, I’m gonna find out who did dis? I got my ways, Ways I got my. Aight? Aight? Aight?

NOLA	AIGHT! But, keep it on the low. I really don’t want my name out there  like that and I hope you find him before I do! ‘Cuz you got one thing right. This IS WAR.
	
CLORINDA	Sounds like you and Mars have been spending alotta time together.

CLORINDA	Please tell me it’s not getting serious.

NOLA	Well...

CLORINDA	...really, Nola? You know you’re way too good to be this thirsty.

CLORINDA	Whoa, Whoa. Wait a minute, what is this?Clo...

MILLER	I believe it's what you ordered, the FO-GRE Cucumber Mint Martini.

CLORINDA	I'm sorry, but is this Smirnoff Vodka in my Martini? ‘Cuz I specifically asked for Grey Goose. I can taste the Two dollar difference. 

MILLER	Really?

CLORINDA	Really!

NOLA	C’mon. Clo! It’s fine.

CLORINDA	What’s your name?  

MILLER	Miller!

CLORINDA	Listen, Miller, your beautiful Beard and sense of entitlement do not intimidate me.

CLORINDA	And BTW what exactly is FO-GRE?

NOLA	Or Noha, SoBro, Bedwick BoCoCa, Translation: All places I can no longer afford to live. 

CLORINDA	Facts!

NOLA	You know he’s gonna Spit in ya drink and you’ll get Hepatitis.

CLORINDA	I’m so not worried. Liquor’ll Kill the Germs. Anyway. I’m a partisan of the Consumer Rebellion. It’s all about where and how Companies give back and the founder of Grey Goose supports College scholarships, so there.

NOLA	I feel you but was all of that Drama necessary?

CLORINDA	Absolutely! I'm standing my ground. I'm not going to cede Da Fort to Hipster imperialism.

NOLA	And that’s why I love you!

CLORINDA	Well, you have permission to stab me with that knife if you ever hear me utter the word FO-GRE. Promise
NOLA	It’s weird. THey just left out the “N”. (/You know why they left out the “N”)

CLORINDA	Sooo. I’m glad I got your Sad Mopey Ass outta The House. What’s goin’ on?

NOLA	Still dealin’.

CLORINDA	Well, You look good.

NOLA	Thanks. I’m tryin’ to hold things together, channel my inner bell hooks. Otherwise I’d be a mess.

CLORINDA	Speaking of which, how’s your Girl Shemekka?

NOLA	I dunno. She hasn’t returned any of my Texts. I’m a little worried. Mekka’s Hellbent on... ...What? Nevermind.

CLORINDA	Whatevah. Don’t understand that friendship.

NOLA	You don’t have to. She’s my Ace.

SHEMEKKA	Win, I wouldn’ have asked if it wasn’t important.

WIN	You know where I stand.

SHEMEKKA	Yeah.

WIN	You sure about dis?

CLORINDA	Nola! Nola! 

NOLA	What?

CLORINDA	Have you heard a damn thing I’ve said? Hello! This is the Spot I’ve been talking about...for the Inaugural Diastopian Art Exhibition!

NOLA	Diastopian? What the Hell is that?

CLORINDA	DIASTOPIAN is a phrase coined by Moi. Yes! It’s a movement of forward thinking Afrocentric Artists reaching across boundaries to Fabulate, Deconstruct, Redefine, Assert and Expand the Breadth and Reach of Millennial Voices from the African Diaspora. It’s about Love and Light.

NOLA	This place is Dope!

CLORINDA	Right? I’m gonna bring so much  Black Art into this White Gallery, Folks’ll think they’re in Mother Africa. Can we take a moment?Absorb!

CLORINDA	AND...I want you to be part of it.

NOLA	Stop playing.

CLORINDA	I’ll Kill you if you say no. Crazy.

CLORINDA	Exactly. It’s gonna be the Biggest Show that I’ve ever Curated!NOLA

NOLA	Yes! And Yes! Last Show I did was at that Shit-Hole Gallery in Sunset Park.

CLORINDA	Oh God, I hate that Dude who runs the place. Gustav. He smells like Fried Pork Dumplings and Tequila.

NOLA	He so does. Point is...a Grand total of Seven People signed the guest book, and two of them were my Parents. And this Morning I was staring down that Blank Canvas and thinkin’ what Da Fuck am I doin’? When was the last time I sold a Painting to someone who wasn’t just interested in Beddin’ me? You don’t know how badly I need this. 

CLORINDA	We both do. And ya wanna Freak?...Baptiste said yes to being in the Show.

NOLA	Hold up, Baptiste. The Baptiste?

CLORINDA	And ya know what that means? Every Dealer, every Collector, every Art Tart is gonna be representin’.

NOLA	Who the fuck are you right now?!

CLORINDA	Yes. This is that Real and it scares the Shit outta me.

NOLA	When’s it happenin’?

CLORINDA	I haven’t set the dates yet, so  keep it on the Q.T.

NOLA	On the Lowest of Lows.

CLORINDA	Move over Wangechi Mutu, it’s abouttime for Art Collectors to meet Nola Darling.

ABIN	What are you two doing in here?!

NOLA	Who the fuck you yelling at?!

CLORINDA	Hey. Hey. Nola! Relax. Chill. Chapin Calloway gave me the kKeys.   

ALBIN	Okay. Leave the keys on the counter when you leave.

CLORINDA	I’m gonna text you a number. Okay? She’s a Sistuh.

NOLA	I dunno, I’m not really down with the Therapy thing.

NOLA.	Sorry. I didn’t mean to explode. I’ve got a lot on my Mind and I’m...I’m still a little off center since the Assault. Sorry.

CLORINDA	You need to talk to somebody.

CLORINDA	You’re one of the strongest people I know but there’s some Shit you can’t just brush off.

NOLA	Don’t worry about me. I’m handlin’ it my way.

MADAME LARISSA	A Negative Entity slipped through a Hole in your Aura but luckily I can patch it for $,.

NZINGHA	I’m collecting a lot of the ad energy. You should feel much lighter. Look. See.

OURDES	Alegua is telling me there is Darkness behind you, Miss Darling. Something like a Black Spider/You know when you’re alone in a dark place and you feel someone is there?

MARS	A Black Spider?!

OURDES	Mars, you know I can’t read a client with you in the room. So  largate, before I read you!

MARS	Uh, Ok I’m outty  Geez. Exit,Stage Left.

OURDES	He gets on my damn nerves.

NOLA	Is that all I have to do to get him to leave?

OURDES	There is a Spirit haunting your (ad lib)

OURDES	(An Artist should always protect their Message.) (ad lib?)

NOLA	What if I don’t believe in all this Yoruba stuff?

OURDES	Santo Tomas. Tienes que ver para creer. Meaning you have to see to believe. It’s not my job to convince you but Alegua will show you.

OURDES	You can’t see Gravity but something’s a hold you down. You will need protection. Trust.

DR.JAMISON	Do I have to give up an essential part of my self-expression in order to survive? That’s Nola’s question. I don’t discuss Patients but I don’t think I’m violating her confidentiality if say...well, My first impressions of Nola Darling? Hmm. Insatiable. But I sense a fragile yet vibrant Spirit hovering just beneath the Protective Armor. She’s juggling a lot. Men. Emotions. Ambition.

DR. JAMISON	I’m glad you you’re here. Let’s talk a little about what you want to accomplish. 

NOLA	I want to...

DR. JAMISON	... Breathe. You’re carrying a lot of tension in your Face. Take a couple deep breaths. 

DR. JAMISON	Good. It’s okay to be angry. You were attacked, not just once but twice. First your Body, then your Art. What happened to you is unacceptable and it’s not your fault. So, let go of that. 

NOLA 	I... .

DR. JAMISON	.. Yes?

NOLA	...Feel violated. I want my Body back. I’m used to being...Free. I’m a Sexual Person, that’s how I express myself in my Art and in my Life. And now...I Feel Self- conscious, Anxious, like I need to cover up and hide, even from the Men in my life. 

DR. JAMISON	And why’s that?

NOLA	I dunno. I mean, I dunno why this is all happening to me right now? I feel like I’m in Limbo.

DR. JAMISON	Okay. So, tell me about the Men in your life.

NOLA	Oh God, where to start? They’re each really different, y’know, they feed me in distinct ways, but sometimes I feel like they’re allthreatened by my Sexuality. And I’m  just sick of feelin’ like...like I’ve a make decisions based upon the Male gaze. I useta think I knew what I wanted in a Relationship and...my Art, But now I’m just so Confused.

DR. JAMISON	When you’ve been through some sort of...Trauma, like an Assault, it’s easy to feel like you’re losing control of your Life. Talking about it is one way to begin taking back Control. But, here’s the Truth, you can wear full Purdah, show only your Eyes and Men will still harass you. The solution isn’t covering up, it is finding a way to assert your Power and move through the World with Confidence. We can work on that! But for now, do something that gives you Joy, Nola. Exercise or you know what, wear something that makes you feel Confident or... try something new. Something that makes you Feel Good. Don’t let fear dictate your choices. And don’t forget to Breathe.

NOLA	Thanks for coming out.

CLORINDA	You know me, I don’t need an excuse to shop.

NOLA	Don’t you have something to fold?

CLORINDA	Nola! Yes! That Black Dress is everything!

NOLA	Yeah?...I think I’m gonna get it.
CLORINDA	The suspense is killing me! Come out

ELLIE	Good choice. I looove that Dress. I’ll ring it up for you.

ELLIE	Your total is...$.

CLORINDA	$? Jesus, Nola. Seriously? You can’t even pay your Rent.

NOLA	I can’t explain it but I need this Dress.

CLORINDA	Okay, but you’re too impulsive and that’s probably why you keep getting yourself into trouble.

NOLA	Wait a minute, are you saying that it’s my fault that I got Assaulted? 

CLORINDA	No, but I mean that Dress is ...

NOLA	... What?...Men need to grow up, if they can’t deal with me in this Black Dress then Fuck’em’. I’m tired of ‘em censoring my choices  with their Bad Behavior.

CLORINDA	Whatevah. I’m just sayin’ thatDress is...way too expensive.

ELLIE	How would you like to pay for this?

NOLA	Split it three ways! 

JAMIE	Da-yum!

JAMIE	I thought a nice Dinner might cheer you up. And I’ve been dying to see you.

NOLA	This place is Live.

JAMIE	What’s Live is, that Black Dress is Exquisite, I can’t wait to get you out of it.

SANTO	Welcome Mr. Overstreet. May I take you to your table?

NOLA	What’s wrong?

JAMIE	I thought I’d mentioned that it was...sorta a Business casual vibe.

NOLA	A little variation on the Theme.

JAMIE	Don’t get me wrong, I...I Love your BLACK Dress, but... 

NOLA	...What?

JAMIE	It’s a little Chilly in here, Babe.

JAMIE	This isn’t exactly a Nightclub in Miami. If you know what I’m sayin’?

SANTO	May I take your coat? The waiter will be back with menus. Thanks.

JAMIE	Nola, I’m sorry I’ve been so Crazy. I’m not used to hanging out in the waiting room with other Dudes. If you know what I’m sayin’? I think I’ve been clear about how I Feel about You.
NOLA	

NOLA	You have, and so have I. Mr. Jamie Overstreet, I’m here with you...Right now. Okay? Just you, Me and this Kick Ass view. 
NOLA	This is amazing. Thank you. I’ve walked by here a Hundred times. But, I’ve always been a little intimidated. You know me, I like something more Lowkey.
JAMIE	I know but sometimes you a Turn Up The Volume.

NOLA	And this View. Insane. It feels so quintessentially New York and romantic. I never get bored of it.

JAMIE	I love this view. You look incredible.

NOLA	You know, you’re really too smooth for own good. 

JAMIE	I know.

NOLA	What’s this?

JAMIE	A gift. CITIZEN by Claudia Rankine. I loved it! And I wanna talk to someone about it. And, the Truth is I don’t really have many People in my circle who I think will get it.

NOLA	Wow. Thank you. I’ve been meaning to read this. You’re “complicated” puzzle. Aren’t you?

JAMIE	I like your curiosity.

NOLA	Yeah? I like yours.

JAMIE	Yeah? I don’t see enough of you, Nola Darling. How can we change that?

NOLA	Terms of Endearment.

JAMIE	I understand what you’re askin’ and I’m trying to take care of my Home situation.

NOLA	Hold up. Whoa. NO,NO,NO! I was just thinking about great Film moments that were shot at the River Cafe. You know, “Terms of Endearment”, with Shirley McClaine, Jack  Nicholson and what’s her name, um,Deborah Winger.

JAMIE	Nah, never seen it.

NOLA	You’re kidding. You’ve a see it. Its sooo Sad, you need, like, a hundred tissues. It won the Best Picture in , beating out “The Big Chill” and...”The Right Stuff.”

JAMIE	Who needs IMDB? I got my own Film Encyclopedia right here.

NOLA	You know, I love Films. Particularly Old Ones.

JAMIE	I didn’t get to see a lot of old Films when I was growing up. In my House, it was Cable TV or Clothing, couldn’t afford both. But, let’s talk about why you always change the Subject when I ask you a serious Question?
NOLA	I’m sorry. I forgot the Question. 

JAMIE	Of course you did.

NOLA	You’re so Serious, and I Love that about you. Everybody I know seems to be in between someplace, and you’re, like, already there. And you make me wanna be there with you.

JAMIE	Well, how about next May I take you with me to Cannes.

NOLA	You know, you can’t just put that out there. You know that. Now, I expect to go. 

JAMIE	But, of course. I’m a Man of my Word.

NOLA	Oh really? And your Wife’s Word?  Not fair.

NOLA	That’s right, it’s “Complicated.”

JAMIE	I’ve told ya we’re separated. It’s just a matter of some Paper. That’s all. C’mon Nola, please...feel my pulse. Give a Brother a chance.

USMAN	We have a Kreug .

JAMIE	We didn’t order this.

USMAN	From the Gentlemen at the bar.

NOLA	Who are they?

JAMIE	My Business Partners at Overstreet Investment, Phil and Don.
NOLA	Should we invite them over?

JAMIE	No! They’ll just bore you.

NOLA	How come I never get to meet your Friends?

JAMIE	You’ve never asked.

NOLA	I didn’t know that I had to. Hey, I’m all for keeping it casual, but I don’t want to be your Secret.

JAMIE	What are you talking about, Babe? You’re not.

JAMIE	Can I come up? That Black Dress has been speaking to me all evening.

NOLA	Yeah, in what language?
