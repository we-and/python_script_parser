CAMILLE	Hello everybody!

SIMON	Hello everybody!

CAMILLE	Today, we decided to make a special Q and A episode for you.

SIMON	So please be kind because we didn't really come prepared. Too bad! Here we go!

CAMILLE	Let's begin!

INSERT	HELPING YOUNG DIABETICS PRESENTS: GENERATION T-1 - Q&A HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOUR DIABETES THESE DAYS?


2 (01:00:20:09)

CAMILLE	(laughs__)

SIMON	(laughs__) Well... my diabetes is... going pretty well, considering. There are times when things aren't going so well.( uhh_m) (snif) Recently, my glycated haemoglobin was a bit higher than it should be and( uh), and my results haven't been great over the past few months. But my diabetes specialist told me this could be related to hormones and can be expected during adolescence. This can make things... more complicated than they should be. And then there's... well there's the fact that I go out a lot, and that I don't always pay attention to what I'm supposed to do, like... monitoring my glycaemia regularly... which( uh_)... can... can make me spike or crash without me even knowing it and... and I should... learn how to deal with it!


3 (01:01:01:06)

CAMILLE	Lately, my diabetes has been really off the charts. All my results are extremely high! But, just like Simon, it's( uh_) it's( uh_) caused by adolescence.( hh) I'm the kind of person who stresses quickly, and so, because of that, my glycaemia spikes. So( um_) I tell myself "it's not my fault". I do it all: the bolus, the scans, I eat right, and I avoid most... fatty foods, and I'm at sixteen on average. (h/) And that's when I say: "But why is this happening? What did I do wrong again this time?" I guess sometimes I just wonder why I'm this way and wish that, maybe, it could be someone else instead.

INSERT	WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE A T1D NEWBIE?


4 (01:01:37:10)

CAMILLE	You need to accept who you are and remember you're not alone. Yes, it happened to you, and( uh)... and you need to... transform... this( uh )weakness,... this disease,... which is essentially a weakness for most people, into your strength and tell yourself: "I'm fine with this... and... now... (uh) it's in me, and now, I'm this way, and I accept it, and I accept myself." And also, "I am stronger because( uh_ ) (mts) because I have a past, and I have something you don't have,... and I know more things about this than you do."

OUT (01:02:05:22)

INSERT	WHAT DO YOU NEED TO TELL YOUR PARENTS SO THEY TRUST YOU?


5 (01:02:09:19)

SIMON	We're the ones with the disease, we're the ones who have to deal with it daily, we're the ones who... (h/_) we're the ones who can recognize when we're having a hypo or a hyper when it hits us. When we tell you guys exactly how we're feeling, and you don't believe we're telling the truth, you should stop and try to see it from our point of view, because we're the ones living with it every day. We all know you guys... mean well, but besides the theoretical side of things, you have no idea what it's like!


6 (01:02:33:02)

CAMILLE	Whether it's hypers or hypos, the feelings or sensations we're having are personal to us and to no one else. ( h/_ )And we're the only ones who can describe them to you. We all know that our parents will never be able to entirely "trust us", and that's only because they truly want to protect us. I know what's going on because I'm having the hyper and you're not!

OUT (01:02:49:10)

INSERT	HOW DO YOU HANDLE PEOPLE MAKING FUN OF YOU?


7 (01:02:53:08)

CAMILLE	(mts )Like I said before, you really have to have confidence in yourself. It's not easy, but I guess I was lucky because no one made fun of me. (tsk h/) But( uh) but come to think of it, I can't remember having been ashamed of having diabetes. I never lied about it or had to make excuses, like 'no, no, this is just my telephone' or something like that. (mh/_) So, in fact (uhm)you're better off ignoring them. I have diabetes but... I don't see how that concerns you, so tell me what's the problem? You just have to be the bigger person and let them say what they want. There will always be ignorant people, but I'm smarter than them. (h/) Just ignore what they say.


8 (01:03:25:22)

SIMON	There's absolutely no reason to feel insulted if someone... criticizes or even makes fun of you, it just shows they're a total idiot. And if you really need to answer them, then you can always say: "Yeah, I might have diabetes, and I have insulin to cure me, but you're a total idiot, and there's no cure for that!"

OUT (01:03:39:19)

INSERT	HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE YOUR DIABETES IN ONE WORD?


9 (01:03:43:17)

CAMILLE	I don't have one word that defines all of my diabetes ever since I was diagnosed. It's complicated right now, but maybe I'd say... something like... well, yeah, strength, because it does make me stronger. Yeah.

SIMON	Variable. (laughs__) My diabetes changes all the time. Sometimes I'm fine, other times I'm not well. So, yeah, I'd say: variable.

OUT (01:04:02:20)

INSERT	WHAT MESSAGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE?

CAMILLE	We have diabetes, but we're normal.

SIMON	(uh__ huh__) (laughs__)

CAMILLE	That's all I want to say.

SIMON	We're different like everybody else!


10 (01:04:11:12)

CAMILLE	I hope you enjoyed the video.

SIMON	We'll be back again for more next time!

CAMILLE	See ya!
