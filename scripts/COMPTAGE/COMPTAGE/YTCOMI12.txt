STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...	

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!	

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends! Really Useful 	around the World!

STORYTELLER	Thomas has an adventure in China!	

STORYTELLER	Thomas was chugging through a 	forest – very different from anything he’d seen on Sodor.

STORYTELLER	As Thomas was loaded up with timber, he heard one of the Workers say the wood was called ‘bamboo’.

STORYTELLER	Thomas wondered what the bamboo might be used for. And he looked forward to finding out!

STORYTELLER	Thomas set off through the countryside looking left and right for anything made from bamboo!

STORYTELLER	At the first station, some building 	works were under way.

STORYTELLER	And Thomas saw that the scaffolding was made of bamboo! He peeped his whistle at the Workers...

STORYTELLER	...and one of them gave Thomas a toot back – on a musical instrument... made from bamboo!

STORYTELLER	At the next station, Thomas saw some people sitting on chairs made from bamboo.

STORYTELLER	He even saw someone riding a bamboo bicycle!

STORYTELLER	“This bamboo is Really Useful stuff!” said Thomas. And, as he weeshed out of the station...

STORYTELLER	...he wondered how his final delivery of bamboo might be used!

STORYTELLER	Thomas arrived at his final destination. The last lot of bamboo was taken away. Would it be used for building? To play music? Or maybe even for a bicycle?!
STORYTELLER	No - the last of the bamboo was for eating!

STORYTELLER	Thomas thought it was a shame to eat bamboo when there are so many other things you can do with it.

STORYTELLER	But then he was told that the Giant Panda is a very rare animal. And that bamboo is the only thing that pandas eat – so it is very special.

STORYTELLER	Thomas felt very lucky – to have helped a Giant Panda – and Really Useful indeed!
