(THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL)

NARRATOR	Far-far away in the south of The Heavenly Empire…there lived the Great Dragon. His eyelashes went down deep into the ground and came back up… as beautiful plants healing the souls and bodies of those who suffered. People called the leaves of this plant “tea”. The glory of this drink spread far and wide. Soon, the Great Dragon found men to take care of his eyelashes… and preserve the healing properties of tea. They were called "The White Wizards". The Great Dragon made a magical seal and gave it to the wizards he trusted the most: the Master, his daughter and the Princess. Merchants from all over the world traded great riches for this tea. But then, some of the wizards got greedy. They went to the evil side to control the Dragon. These Black Wizards were led by the Two-Faced Witch. She raised an ancient army… and they took the Dragon's cave. To get more tea, they stopped trimming the Great Dragon's eyelashes. His eyes became heavy and he fell into a deep sleep. The White Wizards fought back to free the Great Dragon… but the Black Wizards were too powerful. The evil forces captured The Master and the Princess. They then put them into prisons on opposite sides of the world.

GUARD	Feeding time, you lazy maggots! We should hang the half of you lot! Hands off!

PRISONER	That’s not enough for breakfast. Give me that! Give me some food, please!

GUARD	Sod off! Come late, get nothing!

JAMES HOOK	One... Two… three!  All in attendance! Of course you are. Where would you go? It's the Tower! 

PETER THE FIRST	Years fly but the jokes are still the same…

CELLMATE	We'll never escape this place.  But we won’t live long anyway.

PETER THE FIRST	Hmm? How do you survive if you don't eat anything? 

MASTER	The sun that rises in the East nourishes me....

CELLMATE	Give it to me!

PETER THE FIRST	Little birdie, pretty little birdie.

CELLMATE	I’ll have water too!

PETER THE FIRST	God damn it!

CELLMATE	I will tell you where I’ve hid my treasure for a tiny piece of this bird. Please, give it to me!


PETER THE FIRST	Ha! I’ve got you, you white little beauty. You see how easily I caught him.

MASTER	That’s a homing pigeon. Not afraid of people.

CELLMATE	Please give it to me!

PETER THE FIRST	Yeah! I can see what you mean! I don't understand... It's... Bloody nonsense!

MASTER	It's a secret code. It’s written backwards.

PETER THE FIRST	Backward? Dear Miss Dudley, I’m missing you immensely… and every day I recall your silhouette in the moonlight ... It looks like it’s somebody's private correspondence.. So, you think we still should read it?

CELLMATE	Oh yes, we should!

PETER THE FIRST	So listen. “Once again I am apologizing for my sudden departure.” I would never leave you, Miss Dudley, if not for the disagreement with your father...

LORD DUDLEY	Debauching yourself|in your father‘s house, and with a common teacher! 

JONATHAN GREEN	I‘m not just a teacher. I‘m a Bachelor of geography and cartography!

LORD DUDLEY	Set the dogs on him!

MISS DUDLEY	Run darling, I love you!

JONATHAN GREEN	I love you too, darling, believe in me!

PETER THE FIRST	Your father, Lord Dudley was absolutely right…

JONATHAN GREEN	Your father, Lord Dudley, was absolutely right. I have indeed spent all of my fortune. I've not wasted it but invested it in my invention.  I've managed to produce a revolution in cartography.  With the help of the fifth wheel of the coach…I can measure distance precisely. Meanwhile, the rest of world is still doing it the old fashioned way.… My fame reached the Russian Tsar… who ordered me to map of the borders of his European possessions. 

PETER THE FIRST	Yes, right! I remember him! The clever scientist! I met him during my embassy trip to England. "I crossed the whole of Europe..."

JONATHAN GREEN	I crossed the whole of Europe and after passing over the mountains of gloomy Transylvania…I reached the wild forests of Little Russia. There, I encountered phenomena that cannot be explained by science!  It was as if ancient legends and tales told at night to frighten children came to life before my eyes. I saw an ancient creature with countless eyes. Its name was Viy. With a single glance it could read your mind and know your innermost thoughts. The locals, called Cossacks, suddenly turn into strange beasts during their nightly feasts. and flying monsters could appear as if from nowhere. These are the unfathomable adventures, Miss Dudley that I experienced on my way to Moscow. These strange visions still haunt me… and it seems they shall haunt me as long as I live. I was certain, dear Miss Dudley... that a reward from Peter the Great awaited me in Moscow. But that is not what happened...I brought the map, as we agreed. 

MENSHIKOV	Mister Jonathan Green needs no introduction! And I am Sasha Menshikov! Alright, follow me! Maps are delightful objects. We do appreciate them. 

JONATHAN GREEN	It's wonderful!

MENSHIKOV	We've heard about your fifth wheel. An original invention! Such detail! I've never seen such a detailed map!

DANISH AMBASSADOR	Oh look! My dear Denmark is here! So small!
 
DUTCH AMBASSADOR	And this here my dear Holland! So very small as well!

JONATHAN GREEN	Be careful! My map!

MENSHIKOV	Everything in Europe is small! Here in Russia, everything is so big! 

IMPOSTOR	Hear! As the eagle is our national bird....none may defecate|while in an eagle pose!

JONATHAN GREEN	I was led to believe that I would have an opportunity to meet him, so where is he?

MENSHIKOV	What do you mean? Here He is, simply go and meet Him.

IMPOSTOR	Caw!

JONATHAN GREEN	That’s not him!

MENSHIKOV	Are you certain the one you met was Peter? 

JONATHAN GREEN	Yes!

MENSHIKOV	The First?  The Great? Music! Everybody stand up! Dance! Dance now!

JONATHAN GREEN	I met him at his Embassy. The court scientist, Isaac Newton, and myself… Well we saw…

MENSHIKOV	You were in Europe! How it could have been the Tsar? Guards! Send him to the dungeon! 

JONATHAN GREEN	My eyes!

PRISON GUARD	Move, pig! 

JONATHAN GREEN	My eyes! Agrh! My eyes! And these, dearest Miss Dudley, are my latest tidings. This shall also be my final letter to you as I only have a single pigeon left.

PETER THE FIRST	I suppose, Mr. Green requires my assistance. May I use your feather, Master? Thank you. This pigeon is our only chance to get out of here. If Miss Dudley loves this Jonathan true, we can expect to have visitors soon.

MISS DUDLEY	Now, the long-barreled musket.

LORD DUDLEY	So, shall we close the book?… 

MISS DUDLEY	Father!

LORD DUDLEY	What?

MISS DUDLEY	Look at this! It's from Jonathan! He's in trouble! 

LORD DUDLEY	Don’t tell me! From that lunatic scientist of yours, is it? What’s he done now? He’s been taken hostage by a house full of witches? 

MISS DUDLEY	Father, please stop! He is the father of my child! 

LORD DUDLEY	I hardly need reminding of that.

ELISABETH CHASE	Please, we want to hear more! 

MISS DUDLEY	Go and play for a bit!

LORD DUDLEY	Dearest Miss Dudley! Now I'm coming to Moscow...

MISS DUDLEY	Now, look at this, it's not Jonathan's handwriting!

LORD DUDLEY	I, the Great Sovereign, the Tsar of the Great and Small or White Russia,  to the one who reads this message announce that I am held prisoner in an English dungeon known as Tower Grey Prison. I am the one and only rightful ruler of the Russian lands. Peter the First. What’s this nonsense about Peter The First being in prison? Is this some secret code of yours, hmm? 

MISS DUDLEY	I don't understand it myself. 

LORD DUDLEY	Then that womanizing swindler Baron Charles Whitworth …in his role as her Majesty’s ambassador…is about to embark on a diplomatic mission to the Russian Tsar. Get the pigeons ready - they’re going to Moscow immediately! 

HERALD	Ambassador of Her Majesty Anna, Queen of England and Scotland of the United Kingdom of Great Britain!

PRISONER	All my ancestors had the beards! 

JONATHAN GREEN	Thank you, boy!

PRISON GUARD	Give this Chinaman 30 lashes…and then we're sending him off to Siberia!

SOLDIER	Let’s go!

JONATHAN GREEN	That's barbarous! Leave him alone! He's just a boy!

PRISON GUARD	And here is the Englishman! 

HERALD	By the order of His Majesty, I order you, ignorant peasants, not to wear beards! Cut your beards! Finally, you will live like civilized people! 

ENGLISH AMBASSADOR	What is happening here? 

MENSHIKOV	Peters’ Reformations! Building up a civilization.


JONATHAN GREEN	I am a subject of Her Majesty, the Queen of England.

MENSHIKOV	Here he is! And, you'll notice, in perfect health!  Let him go!

ENGLISH AMBASSADOR	Jonathan, you are forgiven and fully pardoned. Lord Dudley sent you these pigeons.

MENSHIKOV	I have a great idea! You could go the Far East and chart a new map of our borders. And listen here, don't even think about running away to Europe! 

ENGLISH AMBASSADOR	And keep what you see to yourself!  It's less trouble.

JONATHAN GREEN	I'm going East? Then there’s a condition. I'll need an assistant. I'll take the boy.

MENSHIKOV	You want this little fool? Did you not hear, you brute?  Take him, he is yours! 

JONATHAN GREEN	Let's get you out of this madness. Once you’re free of here, you can do what you like. Over here. Give me those. 


MENSHIKOV	Meet the Englishman outside the city…and make him disappear. And the Chinaman. 

JONATHAN GREEN	You all right?  What’s your name? 

CHENG LAN	Cheng Lan.

JONATHAN GREEN	We gonna have to get out of Moscow as soon as possible. I'm going East, but it's a perilous journey.

CHENG LAN	I owe you my life. I'm going to the East as well. 

JONATHAN GREEN	You  know… I awe you. Look, come with me. I need an assistant.

CHENG LAN	I don’t want to bother you. I’ll travel on top… of this carriage.

JONATHAN GREEN	On top? Eh, right, well…Then you need this and… and this.

CHENG LAN	Thank you!

ROBBER	Fancy fur coat here! Monster! They’re devils! Run for your lives!

JONATHAN GREEN	You alright?

CHENG LAN	I’m alright. 

JONATHAN GREEN	Don't worry boy. You are safe now. Can you see what I see?

CHENG LAN	A tiny Kho Tchai.

JONATHAN GREEN	Anything else? It cannot be.  Am I drunk?

CHENG LAN	Tough guy.

JONATHAN GREEN	I told you to stop tormenting the birds. Stop! Come on you! Out... Out! Fly safe! Don't even think about it! My darling Miss Dudley, it seems that some kind of conspiracy is going on in Moscow. The real Peter the Great never came back from England.

GUARD	Hold! Why are you here?

MISS DUDLEY	I have an appointment with the prison chief.

JONATHAN GREEN	Using my maps Lord Menshikov has blocked all the roads. Until the real Russian Tsar returns to his throne…I can only go East.

MISS DUDLEY	I would like to see Mister James Hook! 

JOHNNY LION	Milady, sorry. Mister Hook is temporarily engaged. 

MISS DUDLEY	What's going on here? 

JOHNNY LION	It's a fight with the prisoners!

MISS DUDLEY	Is that Mister James Hook? I've heard he has a savage temper.

JOHNNY LION	At this very moment the prisoner is beating Mister Hook. 

JAMES HOOK	Well, it wasn't your day. The fear fight is the only way out of here. Anyone who can get to the top is free. Who is next?

ZHONG YI	It seems that Master is not here. We must return to China. 

ZHONG ZHE	Chen Lang will need our help. 

JOHNNY LION	Milady, Mr. Hook is kinder and fairer than you might think.

ZHONG HAO	Zhong Zhe, go and find Cheng Lan! 

JAMES HOOK	This man won his freedom in an honest fight! Let him go! He is free! 

ZHONG ZHE	I won't abandon my brothers! We will fight or leave together! 

JAMES HOOK	Alright… I respect your choice. Let them all go!

PRISONERS	Blimey! He really did it! They were fighting like tigers! Look, he's letting them go! 

JAMES HOOK	Enough for today! break down the ring! Go back to the exercise, gentlemen! Perfect your bodies! Remember, a healthy body houses a healthy mind! Mens sana in corpore sano! Exercise! Allow me a moment, Miss… This way!

PRISONERS	There's a pretty lass! You're a nice-looking lady! Such sweet little feet! That's it! Come on down here! Come to me, my beauty! 

CELLMATE	For tomorrow, could you change your routine? My right arm is twice as long as my left. I'll soon be able to touch the river! 

PETER THE FIRST	I’ll never learn. that, Master.

MASTER	If you don't get it, you'll wear your mask forever!

JAMES HOOK	You have an influential father, Miss Dudley. Otherwise I would never let a woman come to this Tower. Please, sit down. I hope you enjoy all the antiques that I've collected over the years. Here this is the helmet of Charlemagne. And this is my pride and joy… Spartacus! And here is the sword of king Arthur! Think about that! King Arthur! Now I could go on with this for hours! What can I do for you milady?

MISS DUDLEY	Mister Hook…I have been informed that one of your prisoners is the real Russian Tsar… Peter the First. He hasn't been able to come home for many years, and I…

JAMES HOOK	We don't have any tsars or kings in our prison. We do have a… Russian prisoner, yes. But he's a spy, Peter Mikhailov. I can show you! But be very careful, Miss Dudley! Don't walk any closer to the prisoners than this line. They can be very aggressive!

MISS DUDLEY	Could you please leave us alone? I need to speak to them.

JAMES HOO	Just scream if you need help.

CELLMATE	Please! Let me touch you! Please…Please, just one touch! Bring your beautiful little ear over here and I'll tell you my secret! It will be our secret!

MISS DUDLEY	You are too old to be King.

CELLMATE	Please…

MISS DUDLEY	And you don't look like a Russian. So it must be you. Are you the Russian tsar? 

PETER THE FIRST	Of course, I am. Don’t you see that?

MISS DUDLEY	My husband’s life depends on you, getting your throne back. He is supposedly in Russia heading East with some Chinese boy…

PETER THE FIRST	Have you received a new letter?

MISS DUDLEY	Here it is… “My assistant is very young and childlike…but he has great strength, courage and unprecedented skills. I would have taken him for a girl at first glance, if I hadn't seen Chen Lang with my own eyes dealing with a whole pack of robbers in the woods.

MASTER	Cheng Lan is my daughter.

MISS DUDLEY	Daughter? Cheng Lan is a girl? Jonathan is traveling with a girl? I’d never have come here if I’d known. He is traveling with a girl!  Oh my God!

PETER THE FIRST	Wait! Wait!	 It says that he thinks it's a boy.Maybe nothing happened yet.

MISS DUDLEY	Yet? Nothing happened? 

MASTER	Can you help us? Just make sure the gate is open. 

MISS DUDLEY	Why would I believe you?

MASTER	My daughter will lead him to China! 

PETER THE FIRST	Do you really wanna see your husband alive again?

MISS DUDLEY	Of course, I do!

PETER THE FIRST	It seems that the old man has already got his freedom ... 

MISS DUDLEY	Good heavens! What happened to him? Is he dead? The soul of one of your prisoners has escaped!

JAMES HOOK	That's impossible! He is dead indeed! How peculiar! Well. At least he died happy.

MISS DUDLEY	Why do you think so? 

JAMES HOOK	As far as I know he hasn't seen a woman in thirty years. All right, take him out! One mouth less to feed.

MASTER	The gate!

PRISON GUARD	John, the old man died, let’s go get him out of here. 

JAMES HOOK	Now, I have to tell you, we do have some impostors in here. We have one man who believes that he is Christopher Columbus. And another one who thinks he is Don Quixote! Oh, think about that!

PRISON GUARD#1	Stay back!

PRISON GUARD#2	So now you won’t tell us where the buried treasures are!

PRISON GUARD#1	This man was like a legend!

PRISON GUARD#2	He's been here all his life in the Tower. 

PRISON GUARD#1	Hey old man! Where are the treasures?

PRISON GUARD#2	Well, let's get him out of here! 

PRISON GUARD#1	Oh no!

PRISON GUARD#2	Oh shit!

PETER THE FIRST	Your hand, Master!

PRISON GUARD#3	Don't move, or I'll shoot!

JAMES HOOK	There's something happening! Raise the ladder!

JOHNNY LION	Take my hand, milady. 

PRISON GUARD	Don’t move!

PETER THE FIRST	Come on! The Dragon Fist!

MASTER	Sorry…go!

JOHNNY LION	Come down!

MISS DUDLEY	Please, don't let go of me! 

JAMES HOOK	In 500 years no one has ever escaped…

PETER THE FIRST	You wanna jump? 

JAMES HOOK	Come on, go back to your cells! Do they think I'm joking?

PRISON GUARD	Stop! Or I'll shoot! 

JOHNNY LION	It’s fine, come down! I said, come down!

JAMES HOOK	Don’t shoot! I'll deal with them…

PETER THE FIRST	You are free, my friends.

JAMES HOOK	Come on, get down!

PETER THE FIRST	Master! I’m in trouble!

JAMES HOOK	Oh, you little snake…

JOHNNY LION	You need to leave now!

MISS DUDLEY	I’m so afraid!

PETER THE FIRST	What are you doing? 

MASTER	I want to find something!  

PETER THE FIRST	We don't have time!

MISS DUDLEY	That's enough protection, you are too rough. That's enough!

JAMES HOOK	Go back!

PETER THE FIRST	What are you looking for? 

MASTER	A seal!

PETER THE FIRST	This one?

MASTER	Like this!

JOHNNY LION	Don't move! 

PETER THE FIRST	Look up there! It's been awhile since I had a sword in my hand! Hurry up, Master!

MISS DUDLEY	Stop! Stop it!

GUARD	You can't stop here! 

MISS DUDLEY	I said stop here! 

GUARD	You can’t stop here!

MISS DUDLEY	Now stay here!

MASTER	I’ve found it!

PETER THE FIRST	Come on! Push harder! Damn it! It’s stuck!

MASTER	Give this to Chen Lang...


PETER THE FIRST	How will I find her?

MASTER	The Seal is magic. If you have it, it can help you!

PETER THE FIRST	I swear to find her!

MASTER	Get out of here!

GUARD	I said you can’t... Stop…ahh! Shoot! Over here!

PETER THE FIRST	Faster! Go!

GUARD	Take him! Fire! Stop the carriage!

JAMES HOOK	I've been waiting for this for a long time! You will make a fine specimen in my collection. You’re a great fighter!

MASTER	You’re very strong too.

JAMES HOOK	Just remember, we are still chained to each other. So you are not going anywhere.

GUARDS	No one has ever escaped the Tower.

PETER THE FIRST	So I'm going to be the first.

GUARD	After him! Quick! Faster! Faster!

MASTER	You look better this way!

JAMES HOOK	Ah… You look younger!

MASTER 	Do I?

JAMES HOOK	No, no! Don’t touch this! This is the helmet of Genghis Khan!

MASTER	Helmet?

JAMES HOOK	Yes!

MASTER	Pffft! This is the incense pot! So stupid…

JAMES HOOK	No!  This is the spear of Alexander the Great. No, don’t touch that one! No, this is the sword of the Turkish Sultan! No! No! No! No, no, no! No, no!

MASTER	So what should I do?! Good! That’s fair.

PETER THE FIRST	Damn! Where did you come from? 

GUARD	You won’t get away that easy from me!

MISS DUDLEY	Gentlemen, please stop now, or we'll be killed!

GIRL	Goodness! Are you alright? Can I help you?

GUARD	He escaped from the Tower! 

MASTER	Hey, big guy! You are only helping me!

JAMESHOOK	You're helping me get down…

PRISONERS	Look! He's almost at the top! Now run! You're free!

JAMES HOOK	Not today!

MISS DUDLEY	And where is the China man?!  You escaped together! He said, he'd bring Jonathan home!

PETER THE FIRST	I’ll be doing that for him.

MISS DUDLEY	Sure you can do it?

PETER THE FIRST 	Yes! I need to return the Seal! I gave him my word!

BOY	Give it back here sir! Oi, give my hat back!

MISS DUDLEY	Are you going to China? Take me with you! Hey! Hey!

PETER THE FIRST	Get out of my way! A Russian ship… What luck! Where is it headed?

SAILOR	To China. And who are you? Why I don’t remember you?

BOATSWAIN	Throw it there near the barrels with Makheevs’s sauce.

SAILOR	Put the grain barrels at the stern, by the water barrels!

BOATSWAIN	Move faster! A tortoise could do it quicker'n you!

SAILOR	Oh, such a pretty lady! What's she doing in a place full of scallywags and|ne'er-do-wells like this?

MISS DUDLEY	Don’t touch me! Take your hands off me! Excuse me, ladies, could you tell me how to book passage on the Russian ship?

PROSTITUTE	Oh, Russian sailor!… 

MISS DUDLEY	Oh, stop it! Stop it!

RUSSIAN SAILOR	What are you doing? I'll go if I damn well please! Ladies…I’ll be sailing soon. So I’ll need something to drink  and someone pretty to share it with.

MISS DUDLEY	Well… It looks like I have no choice…

RUSSIAN SAILOR	That's a ruble. I could buy a fine mare in Moscow for that!

MISS DUDLEY	Hey! Russian! Mmm? Will you take me to your ship?

RUSSIAN SAILOR	A woman on a ship means trouble. I’m in a hurry! 

MISS DUDLEY	I'm in a hurry too! Quickly then! Let's go!

SIRKO	Where is the captain's case of whiskey? And just who are you?

ZHONG BROTHERS	This gentleman hired us.

MAKHEEV	Yes, yes, let them through!

SPIRID	What’s that?

MISS DUDLEY	Whiskey.

CAPTAIN	Stop! This is mine! Come with me, sir! Where are you going? Come back here! Stop! Put it down. Single-malt?

MISS DUDLEY	aYes, sir...

CAPTAIN	So you know your whiskeys, do you?…

MISS DUDLEY	Yes, I do.

BOATSWAIN	Makheev, are you sure this is the captain who will take us to China?

CAPTAIN	Pour me! Appreciated!

MAKHEEV	It's written all over his face: "World cruise!"

CAPTAIN	Now you!

MAKHEEV	I found him at the port tavern, haunt of all the old sea dogs…

BOATSWAIN	Cast off the lines! You, landlubbers! Clear the moorings!

RUSSIAN SAILOR	Stop! You forgot me! Stop! I am Russian! You forgot me! Don’t leave me here!... Wait! Wait!

CAPTAIN	Sail on!

BOATSWAIN	Faster! Spread the sails! 

JAMES HOOK	Let’s see how you train this time around!

JONATHAN GREEN	Dear Miss Dudley, I proceed on my journey to the East. The longing in my heart for you grows with the distance between us. My way is filled with dangers and leads me anywhere, but home. Now we are crossing the Baikal, the most beautiful lake in the entire world! I leave Russia heavyhearted. The future of this country without the real Peter the Great is gloomy and unknown.

PETER THE FIRST	What's the Captain's name? Which port does this ship belong to?

BOATSWAIN	What did you drink, you tin scarecrow?! The bucket is used for completely different purposes on this ship.

PETER THE FIRST	What are you laughing , dirty servants? Kneel before your Tsar!

BOATSWAIN	Woah!

PETER THE FIRST	And you, call the Captain! 

BOATSWAIN	He's right here! 

PETER THE FIRST	Where?

BOATSWAIN	Here!

PETER THE FIRST	Where? I don't see him!

CAPTAIN	Blah-blah-blah-blah! 

PETER THE FIRST	What is it? 

CAPTAIN	Where the heck is he from? Figures, throw this trash in the hole!

PETER THE FIRST	You are here, Mi... 

SAILOR	Well done! Smack on the gob! 

SAILOR	Boatswain!  There’s a storm up ahead!

BOATSWAIN	Captain, look over there! There's a storm coming.

CAPTAIN	Take command!

BOATSWAIN	Lower the topsail and the topgallant sail! Raise the headsail! Move faster! You are all moving like turtles!

SAILOR	A woman!

BOATSWAIN	Lady’s bloomers?!

CAPTAIN	A woman! Everybody search!

BOATSWAIN	Here! Check all the cabins! Go!

SAILOR	Look over there!

SIRKO	Looks like Captain's assistant is a girl! 

MISS DUDLEY	Help me!

PETER THE FIRST	What are you doing here? 

MISS DUDLEY	The London police were looking for me because of you!

PETER THE FIRST	Give me the keys!

MISS DUDLEY	Don’t touch me!

PETER THE FIRST	Hey, stop it! Or I'll show you “the Dragon's fist” punch!

BOATSWAIN	Hold on! Hold on tight!  Everybody! On deck! There’s a huge wave! Where's the Captain? 

KHOMA	Oh, my Lord, with your heavenly power, God, help me overcome this storm and deliver our ship from its evil embrace!
 
BOATSWAIN	Rocks ahead! 

MISS DUDLEY	Oh Lord!

PETER THE FIRST	I'll go between! 

BOATSWAIN	We can’t, can we?..

ZHONG HAO	ZhongZhe, hold on!

SAILOR	I see the light! 

BOATSWAIN	Well, everyone alive?  I don’t’  see the captain.

PETER THE FIRST	What is it? Who is there?

CAPTAIN	Yo ho ho and a bottle of… Whiskey!

BOATSWAIN	Oh, he’s alive.

CAPTAIN	The storm has its perks! It tipped the bottle right into my mouth, and delivered me a snack!

BOATSWAIN	Lock him up! And no more whiskey for him!

CAPTAIN	Hey! What are you doing? Hey, Put me down! Or I’ll throw you to the sharks!

BOATSWAIN	Cheers to the Tsar - Hurrah! 

SAILORS	Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! 

BOATSWAIN	I've never seen such seamanship! Only Peter the First could have saved us!

JONATHAN GREEN	Dear Miss Dudley, I miss the touch of Your gentle hands! I often recall the quiet evenings we shared in England, when you and I, alone, would study geography. They were, in a word, magical. My journey follows the Silk Road.  Once, it was the whole world's primary trading route. Soon, we will see the Great Wall of China. I wish you could stand next to me as we see this wonder of the world! My assistant has stayed on the roof of the carriage the entire way. Despite my efforts, I have not managed to persuade him to come down and ride in the carriage with me, where it is comfortable. The boy is strangely unyielding…It's the last of the water Cheng. Here, take it!

CHENG LAN	No, thanks.

JONATHAN GREEN	Take it! We have crossed the whole of China to reach Chengs’ village. There, on the edge of the Celestial Empire, is a port where merchants fro all over the world sail to buy tea. If I am fortunate, I'll find a British ship there. If I am fortunate, I'll find a British ship there.

CHENG LAN	My village has changed. I don't  recognize it anymore. There are dark clouds over Dragon Cave. And there's a fortress wall that wasn't there before. What can you see?

JONATHAN GREEN	Oh God! Cheng! There are soldiers beating up the farmers. Come! Look!

CHENG LAN	Something is very wrong, my people are suffering. I must help save them!

JONATHAN GREEN	I'm sick of this! Let's find another port, there is nothing but trouble there. Let's turn the carriage around and go the other way!

CHENG LAN	But I cannot leave! I am the True Princess! Goodbye, dear Jonathan… 

GUARD	That tofu we took from the merchant yesterday was delicious!

GUARD#2	Yes, it was.

GUARD	Should we get more today? 

GUARD#2	Of course.

SELLER	Care to buy some tea? It's half-price today! We sell our tea for a pittance to pay the princess's taxes! 

VILLAGER	We can't go on like this... 

YOUNG VILLAGER	Shhh! Be quiet! They have ears everywhere! You want to go to prison?

AFRICAN MERCHANT	No, no! Cheaper! 

TEA SELLER	That's my lowest price.

AFRICAN MERCHANT	Half that price and I’ll take everything! 

TEASELLER	Fine, sold! Did you all hear that? He bought all the tea! We'll eat meat tonight! Here, quickly! Hurry, hurry! Quickly! Here!

GENERAL	Make way! Now get lost! Spread out! Surround the square! 

WITCH SERVANT	Filthy peasants! Pay the gold and be gone! We do so much for you begging the Dragon not to be angry and to grant us the healing tea!

OLD MAN	Please accept this, Lord Treasurer.

WITCH SERVANT	Play on. Gold! Where did you hide the gold? Just hand it over if you value your own homes.

TEA SELLER	You know the tea isn't what it was. My customers spit it out most of what they buy. That’s all I have.

WITCH SERVANT	And this… what is this? You thought you could even shortchange us, imbeciles? You stupid nitwits you don't understand that we have magical powers to always know what is real gold?! These tricks with iron won't work on us! You buffoons! And who do we have here?

GRANDFATHER	How long? For how long are you going to rob us all? The tea has lost its powers! You'll make us all sick!

GRANDMOTHER	Please, don’t!

WITCH SERVANT	Oh, so we have a rebel on our hands! Arrest him! The Dragon will deal with him tomorrow!

GRADDAUGHTER	What are you doing? Stop! Grandpa! Grandpa! Let him go! 

CHENG LAN	Got you! How could you? You traitor!

WITCH SERVANT	The Moon has come down to earth! Happiness has graced our village! You've finally returned!

LI HONG	Li Hu, you have to leave! It's too dangerous!

VILLAGERS	Get down!

WITCH SERVANT	It hurts! Oh, princess!I've seen the error of my ways!

CHENG LAN	I saw you robbing these people. Whatever happened to being a White Magician. You swore to serve the people and the great Dragon!

LI HONG	Princess! What are you doing here?

CHENG LAN	Li Hong?

LI HONG	Do you think you can walk around unrecognized?

CHENG LAN	You are my friend. I don't want to fight you!

LI HONG	Why are you torturing us like this?

SOLDIERS	Hep-one, hep-two, hep-three... 

WITCH SERVANT	Princess! Princess! Here you go, this is all for you! My Moon! Oh, my Sun! I think I saw her! 

WITCH	Who?

WITCH SERVANT	The real Princess.

WITCH	What? So did you or did you not see the Princess?

WITCH SERVANT	I'm not sure that was really her. Oh, Great Sovereign of the lands! You are the Sun! I mean the Moon,mmmm...

WITCH	Shut your mouth! Get off!! Gather the people immediately…and make everyone see that the Dragon obeys me! I'll have to put on that vile mask of her face again…Such a shame to hide my beautiful face!

MAIDSERVANT	Yes, Princess. So pretty!

WITCH	Soon the time will come, when… When I finally recover the Dragon Seal, and show them all my true face!

WITCH SERVANT	Allow me to introduce the Princess, the True Beauty and a Great Ruler chosen by the Dragon! She is always delighted to greet and welcome the foreign guests!

JONATHAN GREEN	Let me introduce myself! My name is Jonathan Green. I'm a scientist and a Cartographer! I draw maps of the places that I've visited.

WITCH SERVANT	Here you go my Princess.

WITCH	This map shows the lands all the way from here to Europe. We could ship our tea there by land not just by sea. What is the purpose of your visit?

JONATHAN GREEN	I took a detour from my journey to see your famous Dragon. Are you the legendary Princess of the White Wizards…and the keeper of the secret of the healing tea?

WITCH	Yes, I am the Princess, the Master of the Dragon.

JONATHAN GREEN	I have an assistant Cheng Lan.. He has a he has a remarkable resemblance to you. I mean you could be twins. That’s uncanny! You are not related, are you? 

WITCH	Indeed... We do look alike. Can we show him the Dragon?

LI HONG	The Witch has taken your appearance. Everyone thinks she is the chosen one! She forces the Dragon to execute people.

CHENG LAN	If the Master has the Dragon Seal, how are they able to control him?

LI HONG	Look, isn't that you?

CHENG LAN	Now I understand why the overseas sculptor made a bust of me. They used it as a cast!  Kho Tchai? What are you doing here? Where is Jonathan? Jonathan Green! He is my friend! We have to warn him that he's in danger!

WITCH SERVANT	Today we are blessed on Earth, Our lovely Princess, beautiful as the Moon comes down on Earth to blesses us today with her pearly, glowing countenance! And now you'll be forever so grateful! Behold! This girl has been lazy…and failed to pick her quota of tea leaves. Surely she can work better, and is worth keeping alive! But her fate may only be decided by one will…the Dragon!

JONATHAN GREEN	Sorry!

CHENG LAN	Be careful, you're in mortal danger. We need a map of the palace to save you.

JONATHAN GREEN	As an Englishman grateful to his gracious hosts, I wonder…would the Princess be interested in me making a detailed map of the kingdom?

WITCH	You may commence work at your convenience.

JONATHAN GREEN	Well I suggest we commence immediately!

CHENG LAN	She has everyone fooled! It looks like she's using the ancient magic… but that isn't the real Dragon Seal at all!

GIRL	Oh, Great Dragon! Save my grandfather! Aaah! Grandpa!

JONATHAN GREEN	What's happening? What is this? 

CHENG LAN	How is this possible? How could she force the Dragon to do this?

LI HONG	This place is no different from a prison. Once you come to this village, you can never leave again.We've tried to handle the guards…but the Dark Wizards are helping them, so it’s useless.
 
LI HU	Sister, are you hurt? 

LI HONG	This girls’ grandfather was executed today, her mother was sold into slavery. Here, please, don’t cry. I promise we'll get your mother back.

CHENG LAN	Do you know the Dragon song? Sing it for me...

WITCH SOLDIER	Silence! Enough singing. You'll sing a different song on the plantations tomorrow! And left! 

PETER THE FIRST	Frightening… but quite interesting!

MERCHANT	These are Russian traders here to buy our tea! They want to buy all the tea in the village!

SOLDIER	Let them in!

MERCHANT	Oh thank you! Please come!  This way…

PETER THE FIRST	Oh, finally, the ground!  I'd love to eat something…as long as it's not a seafood.

SELLER	Scorpions! Live scorpions! So delicious! Live scorpions! Try some!

PETER THE FIRST	I'm not really hungry!

SELLER	Try this tea!

MISS DUDLEY	Why are you doing this?

PETER THE FIRST	I’m looking for the Princess.

SELLER	Look! He has the Dragon Seal!

LI HU	Sister! I saw the Dragon seal! Some foreigner has it... He is with the guards!

JONATHAN GREEN	A-mazing! This isn't magic. It’s just science…

MISS DUDLEY	Well, I'm wondering if you have forgotten, that you promised me to search for my husband. Well, I would really appreciated if you could stay focused on that and not let ourselves be distracted! And stop behaving like an idiot and for goodness sakes stop showing this thing to everybody. And... What happened? 

SAILOR	Fellas, where is the Tsar??

SIRKO	Where is the Tsar?

MISS DUDLEY	What happened?

CHENG LAN)	Don't move or I'll break your arm! What did you do to my father? How did you get this seal? Who are you? 

PETER THE FIRST	Cheng Lan?

CHENG LAN	How do you know my name? 

MISS DUDLEY	Hands up!

PETER THE FIRST	Thank you, darling!

MISS DUDLEY	I am not your darling! 

PETER THE FIRST	So I want to hear your story now.

CHENG LAN	We've arrived here from Moscow…A wonderful man saved me from certain death...His name is Jonathan Green. 

MISS DUDLEY	Jonathan! Oh…

PETER THE FIRST	Wait, wait, wait...I suppose it was the best journey of his life! Full of wonderful discoveries! Just two of them. A lot must have happened I would think!

CHENG LAN	Yes, there were different situations. But I must say, I always felt good and safe around him.

MISS DUDLEY	Where is he?

PETER THE FIRST	Miss Dudley, please!  I'm sorry, Princess! This is his fiancé. His wife. Mother of his son. Anyway…

MISS DUDLEY	I don't need any excuses…

JONATHAN GREEN	Aeh... You chops know where the bathroom is?  I'm a servant of the Queen! Unhand me! I'm a British…

WITCH	Do you still not understand where you are? I am the law here, and my power is boundless.

JONATHAN GREEN	What powers?! I have seen your inventions... Spears, arrows… These are bronze toys. From a bygone century!

WITCH	You're a blind man, just exactly like all the others! I didn't resurrect any ancient army. I just put my soldiers in invulnerable armor! We've learned to control lightning and we can control the power of sound…And very soon, when I have the Seal of the Dragon I will rule the world! And you are the perfect bait! When she finds out I’ve decided to execute you…she’ll deliver herself right into my hands. Take him away!

MISS DUDLEY	Where the hell did you bring us?

CHENG LAN	I believe it's my turn to ask questions. So… How did you get my father's seal?

PETER THE FIRST	I am very grateful to your father. Both of us were imprisoned in the Tower of London. All those long British evenings he kept teaching me the secrets of his amazing art! And I learned a lot from him!

CHENG LAN	Should I believe you?

PETER THE FIRST	You don't believe me…Well, watch! What are you laughing at?  I broke the chains and I stopped a storm like this!

CHENG LAN	Give them back their weapons.

MISS DUDLEY	Thank you.

PETER THE FIRST	Now you actually do believe me. I can say that you are the true princess. Take it. This is yours. 

CHENG LAN	I'm very grateful to you!

PETER THE FIRST	Chinese monster?

CHENG LAN	The map! You might not believe this, but this creatures are from Russia.

MISS DUDLEY	This is Jonathan's handwriting!

LI HONG	Do you know what it is? Do you understand?

PETER THE FIRST	I know how to read it. We'll need a…

M DUDLEY/CHENG LAN	Mirror! Mirror!

WITCH SERVANT	Oh my rising Sun... The moon has come down from heaven! I have good news! I have brought them! Here!

ZHONG ZHE	Princess, please forgive us... We were unable to find your father. I swear to serve and protect you for the rest of my life!

WITCH	Is this really all you have to tell me about your long trip?

ZHONG ZHE	We have found the Dragon's seal.

WITCH	You've found it? So give it to me!

ZHONG ZHE	A nobleman has it. The Russian Tsar Peter the Great!

WITCH	Zhong Zhe stay here. And you - bring me the Russian Tsar!

ZHONG HAO	Princess!  But how are you? Who…Who’s in the palace?

LI HONG	She's an evil witch! She uses a mask with the princess' face and rules in her stead!

ZHONG HAO	Our brother just swore to give his life in service of that witch!  She tricked all of us!

ZHONGYI	Princess, he’s only in love with you! He never would have been faithful to her if he knew. 

PETER THE FIRST	The Witch and her servants believe that the Palace is inaccessible. He made a very accurate map. We can get in through the cave under the water. My Cossacks can do a lot of things! They will release Jonathan Green… and you will get to your Dragon.

CHENG LAN	My people can also attack the palace by air.

PETER THE FIRST	What do you mean, by air? 

CHENG LAN	Jonathan Green is not only a great cartographer, he is a great scientist!  He has calculated everything precisely according to the flight of a bird. Please, go gather all the umbrellas in the village.

LI HONG	Yes, tell them!

REBEL	OK.

CHENG LAN	I will get to the Dragon, show him the seal and hope he recognizes that I am the true princess. We also need to come up with new weapons to break through their defenses. I suggest we use pepper! We will answer their spears and arrows with pepper from our crossbows. It remains to be seen how we will deal with the Magicians.

PETER THE FIRST	She thinks that I have the seal, so it will give us some more time!

MISS DUDLEY	I'll go and prepare myself too. I need to change the dress! I can't fight in this… The battle is commencing. Help me with my corset! 

CAPTAIN	I’m not your servant, lady! Alright! Take me with you. You won’t regret it!

MISS DUDLEY	I'll think about it. 

CAPTAIN	Woah, you wanna kill me?! 

MISS DUDLEY	You bastard! Or I'll kill you! Good luck!

CAPTAIN	What about me?

SOLDIER	Hey, stop! What do you need that many umbrellas for?

BOY	It's gonna be hot today. 

SOLDIER	Will it be that sunny? 

WITCH	Your Highness, what brings you to my domain?

PETER THE FIRST	Dear Princess, I have a very important mission to pursue…

WITCH	Perhaps we should talk privately then. Come with me!

PETER THE FIRST	That was fast…There are legends about me in Russia.

MISS DUDLEY	Don't let her break your heart, Your Majesty!

PETER THE FIRST	Stay there. I'll be right back.

WITCH SERVANT	Come with me...

PETER THE FIRST	Beautiful chambers.

JONATHAN GREEN	What in God’s name is happening...

WITCH SERVANT	And now let’s have another fairly judged execution! Let the Dragon decide the fate of the foreign traveler!

MISS DUDLEY	This is my husband!

WITCH SERVANT	Is he your husband?

MISS DUDLEY	Please, have mercy!
 
WITCH SERVANT	If he is your husband than it's a completely different story! Now I see, things differently. Well, then arrest her too! Take their weapons away! 

MISS DUDLEY	Let me go! They are lying to you! She is not the real pri…!

WITCH SERVANT	Tie her up with the other foreigner! The white-skinned woman is a witch!

PETER THE FIRST	Mmm! Delicious! 

JONATHAN GREEN	Who’s there?

CONDUCTOR	Go right! Now, open the mouth at him! Pull back to the rock.

SIRKO	That’s, that's not a real dragon! 

SPIRID	Let’s take it all down, shall we?

JONATHAN GREEN	Who... Who is there? Who is it? I can hear you but I don't understand you. Speak clearly...

CONDUCTOR	Open the mouth wilder! Hehehehe! Wait! What do you want? We were waiting for Chen Lang.  Now we have to fry you up as an appetizer!

WITCH	This one is done! Search him and bring the Seal to me. I'll prepare to meet with the Dragon now.

CONDUCTOR	Pump the bellows!  Get the blower ready! That's it!  Hide it up! And prepare the lightning charge!

SIRKO	Where did you come from?

CAPTAIN	Shh! Everybody swam, so I swam too…

SIRKO	Easy, easy! 

CAPTAIN	Don’t worry!

SPIRID	Cut this one too!

CONDUCTOR	And here comes the surprise!

CAPTAIN	Hello beautiful! Still regret me? Now you’re free!

JONATHAN GREEN	Emma?

SPIRID	Run!

JONATHAN GREEN	Oh, sorry! It is you! It’s really you!

MISS DUDLEY	My father was right! Why didn't I listen?.. 

JONATHAN GREEN	What did you do that for? 

MISS DUDLEY	Now do you understand? 

JONATHAN GREEN	You are upset... I can... I can see that.

MISS DUDLEY	Of course I'm upset! You traveled in the same carriage with this… that…Girl!

JONATHAN GREEN	What girl are you talking about?

MISS DUDLEY	The most beautiful girl in China!

JONATHAN GREEN	I love…you!

MISS DUDLEY	Get away!

JONATHAN GREEN	Not now!

MISS DUDLEY	Come on!

JONATHAN GREEN	Run faster!

SOLDIER	Shields! Spears! Archers ready! Shoot! Get ready! Shoot!

JONATHAN GREEN	Come here! Give me your hand! Come, come on!

REBEL	Pepper!

SOLDIERS	Spears! Pepper! Pepper! I can't see a thing! It's pepper! My eyes!

COSSACS	All together!

CAPTAIN	Hurrah! There are a lot of them, and they're very tall. 

WITCH	Dragon. I command you to obey! I am here to save you now… And now…

MAIDSERVANT	Your Majesty... 

WITCH	What? Where is the seal?

MAIDSERVANT	Your Majesty, this is everything we found.

WITCH	I've got to do everything myself!

KHOMA	You need a rest.

REBEL	Get the sheet ready!

WIZARD’S ASSISTANT	Bring them! Hurry up!

SOLDIER	There's nothing left. They destroyed the laboratory!

WITCH	Where is the Seal?!

PETER THE FIRST	Help me up. For your information, people have been trying poison me right from my birth, so now there is no poison that affects me. Get us up if you don’t want me to kill her.

SPIRID	Sirko, help! A bit more, Sirko!

WITCH SERVANT	Oh my incomparable princess, we are finished! The forces are running out, the rebels will soon take over the palace…and they have defeated the magicians!

ZHONG ZHE	Let her go!

WITCH SERVANT	What should we do, my princess? What should we do?

PETER THE FIRST	I've already actually shaved today.

WITCH SERVANT	I have a plan. As I already said, we should run!

WITCH	You're right. Go gather up all the gold. Kill him now!

ZHONG HAO	Zhong Zhe, no! She is not Cheng Lan! She’s the Witch!

WITCH	What are you waiting for? I said kill him!

ZHONGYI	Zhong Zhe, trust us! We are your brothers!

WITCH SERVANT	Gold, gold! My precious gold!

WITCH	Stand by your oath! What are you waiting for? Kill him now!

ZHONGYI	Don't listen to her! 

ZHONGHAO	You swore your oath to Chen Lang, not this witch!

ZHONG ZHE	Is it true? And are you not the real Chen Lang?

WITCH	Don’t listen to them! I am Cheng Lan!

ZHON YI	Zhong Zhe! Zhong Zhe! No!

WITCH SERVANT	Finally, you’ll be mine, Your Majesty!

WITCH	You're too heavy. The boat can't carry the two of us!

WITCH SERVANT	Noooo!

PETER THE FIRST	Definitely, a witch...

WITCH	So long, fools! 

MAIDSERVANT	Mistress! Mistress!

WITCH SERVANT	My princess, my sun! Our Mistress needs our help! 

CHENG LAN	I’ll take your mask off!

WITCH	And I will take the Dragon Seal away from you!

CHENG LAN	You are not worthy of this seal! It only goes to those chosen by the dragon!

REBELS	The Dragon is free!

MISS DUDLEY	Look!

JONATHAN GREEN	Let’s go! This way! Quickly!

CHENG LAN	Stop it! Spare yourself the humiliation! Maybe people will forgive you! How are you doing this?

WITCH	Take the Seal away from her! I don't need you anymore!

MAIDSERVANT	Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

REBEL	Come!

WITCH	Perfect timing… She is the impostor! Take her away!

PETER THE FIRST	What did she say? This is the true princess! I gave her the seal myself! Then, this is the fraud!

CHENG LAN	That’s an impostor!  She’s not the real princess!

WITCH	Silence her!

MISS DUDLEY	Here is your Cheng!

JONATHAN GREEN	Wait, wait! Don't hurt her. She is Chen Lang. He recognized her! He can't be wrong! She is my friend! She is the real Princess! 

MISS DUDLEY	Please, don’t die Jonathan! Not when I’ve just found you! Please, look, don’t die!

WITCH	You silly foreigners! Now I control the power of the Seal! And I am the Chosen! Dragon! Come to me! I command you to fly to me! I command you! I command you! I have the Se…Nasty creature! Dragon, I command you, I command you to save me! No! No, no!

MISS DUDLEY	Please, don't die, Jonathan! Your son is waiting for you! 

JONATHAN GREEN	My son?

MISS DUDLEY	Yes! You have a son! Please... Please, don't die! No!

DANIEL	Hurrah!

LORD DUDLEY	Hop! Hop! Fight! Hop!

DANIEL	Now you have to defend!

LORD DUDLEY	Fight! Hop! Hop! Fight with me, Daniel! Fight with me! Fight with me, Daniel! Hop! Oh, a pigeon!

MISS DUDLEY	Dear father please forgive the smudged writing…

LORD DUDLEY	I've been crying so much in the last few days. I cry... From happiness… Finally I've found him!

JONATHAN GREEN	You saved my life!

MISS DUDLEY	That’s true.

LORD DUDLEY	The one person who could really help us right now is the Master. The one who is jailed in the Tower. I ask you to employ all of your influence to arrange for his release, so that he can return to China as soon as possible...

JAMES HOOK	By the will of Her Majesty, you are now free. It’s unfortunate to lose you already, because I’ve just started to learn about your art.

MASTER	You are the strongest opponent I've ever had.

JAMES HOOK	Free him! Oh, by the way. Lord Dudley mentioned something about “a dragon is free”?

MASTER	Come with me to China. I will show you everything.

CHENG LAN	Did you really swear you were going to protect her for the entire rest of your life?

ZHONGZHE	Yes, but I thought she was you.

CHENG LAN	It's a pity I did not hear it. If you swore it, protect me!

MASTER	You see, it wasn't the seal that gave power over the Dragon. It was love. He sees our hearts. He knows who is good and he helps people with pure intentions. That's why he gave us the healing tea! So, that’s it for today. Go study!

TRAINER	Get ready…Start! One! Two!

MASTER	I’m so happy you’ve finally got out of your prison.

JAMES HOOK	Well... Where is the Dragon? I left the Tower to come all the way over here to see the Dragon.

MASTER	He’s here, he’s everywhere. He’s always among us.

JAMES HOOK	But where?

MASTER	Look! He’s everywhere. He is in the mountains, the sea… and the sky above us!
