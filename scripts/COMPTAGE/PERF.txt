BEATRICE	Now, I want to see love, passion, happy. You’re just married. The fighting doesn’t start before the honeymoon, honey, so smile. Those pants are way too low. I like it. Head up. Shoulders back. Chest out. Throw your chest out! Coffee! And Sumi…

SUNNY	Uh, it’s Sunny.

BEATRICE	It’s supposed to be. You can go.

SUNNY 	Um, I’m here to actually…

BEATRICE	I know, and I don’t need you. Tell your editor they’ll get the pictures when they’re ready. If they’re late, that’s because of you. Run for your life. Coffee. Amanda! Here. Oh, Amanda. I need a fresh cup of coffee. Pronto. Fast!

AMANDA	Ah, are we done? Oh, OK. Well… Excellent work today.

BEATRICE	“Excellent?” Try “barely adequate”. Coffee. And they’d better not have skimped on the sugar.

AMANDA	No, there are five in there. Just how you like it, Miss Bitterly.

BEATRICE	Good. And tell Better Ways & Weddings if they expect me to shoot another cover for their magazines, they are not to send that horrid assistant to their assistant editor ever again.

AMANDA	OK.

BEATRICE	Good. When you started working for me, what, three to five years ago, would you ever have imagined you would go from a lowly intern, fetching coffee and getting people’s mail, to being my personal assistant? You’re on the ladder, my dear. On the ladder. Which way you go now is up to you. My mail. My mail, I said. Tell me if there’s anything important.

AMANDA	This is from a Thomas at Christies.

BEATRICE	I don’t do donations. Next.

AMANDA	This is from Marigold.

BEATRICE	Wow, that’s a check. I’ll take that. Thank you.

AMANDA	This is from “Pantria”… Pantrea. King Buckley.

BEATRICE	I don’t know him. Tell me more.

AMANDA	It says: “Dear Miss Beatrice Bitterly, You are cordially invited to my kingdom of Pantrea as a guest of the Royal Family, to partake in and document our Five Days of Christmas Celebration. This world-renowned event commences on December 21st. All travel and expenses will be covered. I hope you can attend. Sincerely, King Buckley.” There’s a royal stamp and an RSVP email address.

BEATRICE	Not interested. Throw it away.

AMANDA	Oh.

BEATRICE	I’ll see you back here in two weeks after Christmas. And I’m not to be disturbed until I return.

AMANDA	Uh, have fun at your beach house, Miss Bitterly.

BEATRICE	You’ll bet I’ll have.

AMANDA	Happy holidays.

SUNNY	You know, cocoa tastes better if you drink it, not sleep in it. You should’ve added some peppermint, and maybe some sugar.

AMANDA	No. It’s my dad’s recipe. And you know I’m not a sugar fiend. Wow, I am so tired.

SUNNY	Well, that’s what you get when you’re a minion for the “queen of the underworld”. I swear, your boss is, like, the love-child of the Grinch and the Wicked Witch of the West.

AMANDA	Well, if that were true, she’d be greener.

SUNNY	Ever seen her without makeup?

AMANDA	Oh, stop. I feel like if I’m just patient with her, then I will get my shot.

SUNNY	Mandy, you are a great photographer. But no one’s ever going to know unless you do something about it. Stand up to her. Like, now’s the time. The writing’s on the wall. On the wall…

AMANDA	Which wall? I have a headache.

SUNNY	You need an Aspirin.

AMANDA	I do. You know what that wall reminds me of? That wall.

SUNNY	What are you doing with “Beastly” Bitterly’s mail?

AMANDA	Oh, I forgot to throw it out.

SUNNY	And what about this all-expenses paid trip to the kingdom of Pantrea?

AMANDA	Bitterly doesn’t want to go.

SUNNY	This is just what you need.

AMANDA	No. I need my bed.

SUNNY	And a trip out of town. You know you can cover this event.

AMANDA	Yeah, I can do it. But I’m not invited. Go to sleep.

SUNNY	We can soon change that. “Dear King Buckley, I would be honored to attend your festival.”

QUEEN GLORIANA	What is it? Is something the matter, Richard?

KING BUCKLEY	Yes. Why do I keep getting older while you keep looking younger?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Perhaps it’s your failing eyesight, my dear.

KING BUCKLEY	Or that you’ve become incapable of accepting a compliment. Yes?

STANLEY	It is I, Stanley Bishop, your Chief of Protocol.

KING BUCKLEY	Come in, Stanley. We know who you are.

STANLEY	My King, I come bearing…

QUEEN GLORIANA	Good evening, Stanley.

STANLEY	My Queen. I come bearing good news. Beatrice Bitterly has accepted your invitation and is coming to Pantrea.

KING BUCKLEY	Excellent. Excellent news, indeed. I want you personally attending to all her needs and you may pick her up in the new royal vehicle.

QUEEN GLORIANA	The new car? Won’t she find it a bit… you know?

KING BUCKLEY	Well, we have to use it for something. We don’t want Catherine’s father thinking we don’t appreciate his gracious gift, now do we? Besides, do you want to ride in it?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Certainly not.

KING BUCKLEY	Neither do I. So, it’s settled.

STANLEY	Of course, Sire. Oh, one more thing, Sire: it appears Miss Bitterly will be travelling incognito, under the name of Amanda Eastman, as to avoid the paparazzi.

KING BUCKLEY	Thank you, Stanley. That’ll be all.

STANLEY	Sire. Madam.

KING BUCKLEY	A photographer plagued by fellow photographers?

QUEEN GLORIANA	At least we don’t have that problem here.

KING BUCKLEY	Well, Miss Bitterly must know what she’s doing. There are barely any photographs of her online. A woman of mystery.

AMANDA	OK. So, it’s Friday. Wake me up on Sunday.

SUNNY	No time. That was Beatrice: she’s changed her mind about the Pantrea trip.

AMANDA	What? She’s going?

SUNNY	No, you’re going. She decided she doesn’t want to jeopardize her relationship with the Pantreans, so she’s assigning you the job. You’re going to cover the event.

AMANDA	Are you kidding me? This is my shot!

SUNNY	So, let’s get you packed!

AMANDA	Hi.

STANLEY	Hello. And you are…?

AMANDA	Amanda. Amanda Eastman.

STANLEY	How lovely. I’m expecting a Miss Beatrice...

AMANDA	Oh…

STANLEY	Madam, I hope you will forgive me. I completely forgot. But I assure you, your secret is safe with me.

AMANDA	What secret?

STANLEY	“What secret,” indeed? May I?

AMANDA	Yes, thank you.

STANLEY	Right this way, Madam.

AMANDA	Oh, it’s cold.

STANLEY	Yes. Madam.

AMANDA	So, what? You’re, like, the King’s personal driver, or…?

STANLEY	No, Madam. I am the Chief of Protocol: Stanley Bishop, at your service.

AMANDA	Oh, OK. It’s really beautiful here.

STANLEY	We like to call it “home”.

AMANDA	Wow. I think I’m a little underdressed. 

STANLEY	I’m sure you will do just fine, Madam. Please.

STANLEY	I am pleased to announce Miss Amanda Eastman has arrived. May I present, King Buckley and Queen Gloriana.

AMANDA	Your Highnesses.

KING BUCKLEY	It is an honor to have you grace us with your presence. I know you are a busy woman, Miss Eastman.

AMANDA	Oh, not really. Please, call me “Amanda”.

QUEEN GLORIANA	If you wish. But I can assure you, there are no paparazzi spies in Pantrea.

AMANDA	Great.

KING BUCKLEY	Would you like some coffee? We’ve had some made specially for you.

AMANDA	Yes, I’d love some. Thank you. That is very strong. And extremely sweet.

KING BUCKLEY	Five sugars, just as you like it. I read up on you, Miss Bitterly. Your reputation precedes you.

AMANDA	Oh, no, no. I’m not…

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Mother, Father, about this dance… Who are you?

STANLEY	Someone special, Sire.

KING BUCKLEY	Leopold, this is Beatrice Bitterly. A world-class photographer from America. She will be documenting the upcoming holiday festivities to share with the world.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Your father believes her pictures will boost Pantrea’s tourist rate.

KING BUCKLEY	So you could say our kingdom’s future relies on those talented hands and eyes of yours.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	In that case, I suppose it’s only fitting that I meet you on my knees.

AMANDA	Hi.

KING BUCKLEY	Amanda, our son, Prince Leopold.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Who is not usually this clumsy.

CATHERINE	Leo? What is all this?

KING BUCKLEY	Catherine, this is Beatrice Bitterly, world-renowned photographer from America.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Wait, is it “Beatrice” or “Amanda”?

AMANDA	That is the question.

QUEEN GLORIANA	And this is Duchess Catherine of Carthia.

AMANDA	Oh. Charmed. Oh, I rode in your dowry. Very cool.

CATHERINE	Thank you. Leo, I figured it out. We’ll just rig the raffle and then you’ll only have to dance with me.

KING BUCKLEY	We shall do no such thing. I forbid any dishonesty in my kingdom. If I catch anyone doing anything underhand, it’s off with their head.

QUEEN GLORIANA	He just likes to say that.

KING BUCKLEY	It’s a king thing.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Actually, it’s a queen thing.

AMANDA	I feel sick.

KING BUCKLEY	You must be exhausted from your trip. Stanley, would you please show Ms. Bitterly to her room so she can freshen up before dinner and the festivities begin?

AMANDA	Oh, I’m staying here?

KING BUCKLEY	Of course. You are our guest.

AMANDA	OK. Thank you. Ta-ta.

CATHERINE	“Ta-ta?”

PRINCE LEOPOLD	What an intriguing woman.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Savages.

AMANDA	Wow.

STANLEY	Will Madam be needing anything else?

AMANDA	No. I think the only thing missing is a hang-glider for a quick escape.

STANLEY	The kingdom does have access to a small helicopter, Madam, should you decide to take some aerial photographs.

AMANDA	I will bear that in mind.

STANLEY	Very well. I shall call you when dinner is ready.

AMANDA	Oh, Stanley! My secretary RSVP’d for me when I confirmed the trip. What did the email say? Just curious.

STANLEY	It stated you were honored to be invited and would be travelling incognito under the name of “Amanda Eastman”.

AMANDA	I, Beatrice Bitterly, would be attending as “Amanda Eastman”?

STANLEY	That is correct.

AMANDA	Thanks, Stanley.

STANLEY	Madam.

AMANDA	Sunny, you little bitch.

SUNNY	Do you know what time it is, here?

AMANDA	Yeah, time for me to come over there and kill you. You told them that I was Beatrice Bitterly!

SUNNY	I told them to call you “Amanda”.

AMANDA	As a fake name. They think I’m her.

SUNNY	Posing as yourself.

AMANDA	So I’m supposed to pretend to be her, pretending to be me?

SUNNY	It’s way too early for this.

AMANDA	No, it’s way too late, you mean. The royal family are counting on Beatrice —on me— to save the kingdom. And if they find out that I’m not her, they’re going to chop off my head. And when they do, I’m going to come over there and I’m going to haunt you for the rest of your life.

SUNNY	Calm down. You’re just as good of a photographer as Beastly Bitterly. You just need to believe in yourself.

AMANDA	But I’m not myself. I’m herself.

SUNNY	Look, Beastly’s a photographer, you’re a photographer. She’s a woman, you’re a woman. The only difference is reputation. Unfortunately, in this world, you can’t get a reputation without having a reputation.

AMANDA	Are you even speaking English?

SUNNY	This is your time to show them what you can do.

AMANDA	As her!

SUNNY	Eventually, the truth will come out.

AMANDA	And when it does, I’m dead.

SUNNY	Just be yourself. You know what I mean. I’ve got to go to sleep. I love you. I’m sorry. Speak soon.

AMANDA	I can’t do this. I am Beatrice Bitterly, world-renowned photographer. I’m talented, I’m creative, I’m mean. I can’t do this.

CATHERINE	I know that your father loves the holiday celebrations, but we really must start preparing for our upcoming marriage as well. Like, choosing a date, to begin with?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Yes, and we shall do just that. But right after the holidays.

CATHERINE	It’s very important for our kingdoms’ alliances. And ever since I was younger, I always dreamt of being…

PRINCE LEOPOLD	A princess.

CATHERINE	Princesses are a dime a dozen, darling. Queen was always the goal. Ruler of the land.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	And that happens when you marry your prince charming.

CATHERINE	Well, soon-to-be “king charming”. Exactly. But just think: once we’re married, I won’t have to keep trekking back and forth from my castle back to yours every day.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I guess that’s why they call it “settling down”.

CATHERINE	You know, I think you’re right. I’ve never thought of it that way.

KING BUCKLEY	Ah, good evening, Catherine.

CATHERINE	My King.

QUEEN GLORIANA	No need for that, Catherine. We’re all family, here.

CATHERINE	Oh, thank you.

KING BUCKLEY	Well, I am famished.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Do not fear, Richard. You are far from withering away to nothing.

KING BUCKLEY	Has Stanley summoned Miss… Ah, Miss Bitterly.

AMANDA	Good evening.

KING BUCKLEY	Good evening to you. I trust your accommodation is suitable?

AMANDA	Yes. It suits me just fine.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You know, I must apologize again about what happened earlier.

AMANDA	Ohno, it’s fine.

STANLEY	May I say, you look lovely this evening. 

CATHERINE	Oh, I know. I mean, thank you.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	So I hear you’re a woman of many names. What shall we call you?

AMANDA	Amanda is fine. We should stick with that. It makes it easier for everyone. Especially me.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Do you use that pseudonym often?

AMANDA	All my life. So, is this where we’re eating?

KING BUCKLEY	Indeed. Let’s sit.

AMANDA	I’m hungry.

AMANDA	Mmm. Why don’t we just skip the coffee next time and serve me a cup full of sugar?

SERVER	That can be arranged, Madam.

AMANDA	And to think I used to prefer tea. So, there are seven events leading up to Christmas: baking, decorations, and gift-wrapping?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Yes. And this year, all the funds collected are going to Children of Pantrea Foundation, providing toys for the holidays.

AMANDA	That sounds like a great cause.

CATHERINE	Good cause, it is. I do love the little toddlers. I can’t wait to have some of my own running around. Little princes and princesses everywhere. Just like you and I were, way back when. Remember, Leo?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You used to braid my hair.

CATHERINE	Only after you pulled mine. Our union was written in the stars. Call it “fate”, call it “destiny”…

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Call it “an arranged marriage”.

QUEEN GLORIANA	And there’s nothing wrong with that. Don’t you agree, Beat… I mean, Amanda?

AMANDA	Oh, sure. I think romance is overrated anyway. Not for everyone. For some people, obviously, it works. Just, I’m more career-focused.

KING BUCKLEY	An admirable attitude, my dear.

AMANDA	Thanks.

KING BUCKLEY	But tell us more. Tell us something about yourself that is not online.

AMANDA	There’s hardly anything about me online.

QUEEN GLORIANA	So modest, Miss Bitterly.

AMANDA	Oh, well, you know how it is. Journalists often just exaggerate and sometimes they just make things up entirely.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	So, who is the real you?

AMANDA	I’ve been asking myself that question a lot, lately.

CATHERINE	Speaking of “lately”, it is getting late. I’ll bet the townsfolk are starting to gather outside.

KING BUCKLEY	Catherine is right. Let us adjourn to the garden. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la la la la la ‘Tis the season to be jolly…


STANLEY	Madam. To keep you warm. Extra-strong.

AMANDA	Awesome. You know what, Stanley? I’m not going to be able to take photographs and drink at the same time.

STANLEY	I’ll hold it for you.

AMANDA	So, Stanley, what’s the deal between the Duchess and the Prince? The real deal?

STANLEY	I told you, Madam. They’re to be married. The royal family set it in motion when Catherine and Leopold were still very young, so as to unite both kingdoms.

AMANDA	But have they set a date, yet?

STANLEY	Not as of late, Madam.

AMANDA	And what’s the deal between you and the Duchess?

STANLEY	Why, nothing, Madam. I just…

AMANDA	Admire from afar?

STANLEY	…serve the royal family.

AMANDA	Gotcha.

STANLEY	Right.

AMANDA	Wow.

KING BUCKLEY	Dear citizens of Pantrea. I am delighted to announce the commencement of the annual “Five Days of Christmas Celebration”. Now, this year will be very special. Not only do these events sponsor a good cause, but we have a welcomed guest from America documenting our festivities and traditions. Now, please, do not be shy around her cameras. I want the world to see what Pantrea has to offer. Now, the gift-wrapping competition starts in 20 minutes in the palace library. So, all those competing: sign up, make your donations, see Henry —in charge of our donations box— and may the best wrapper win.

CATHERINE	Amanda, come take pictures of Leopold and I by the lights.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Catherine, she’s not here to photograph us.

CATHERINE	Oh, one or two won’t hurt. And I want a world-famous photographer to shoot us. Oh! Maybe we could hire her for our wedding. Now, make sure you take my left side because it’s my better angle.

AMANDA	OK. OK. I’m going to need you to stop moving, just so I can focus. OK, stop moving.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	We’re not moving.

AMANDA	Oh. It’s cold, isn’t it? This’ll be better on a tripod, anyway.

KING BUCKLEY	The contest is about to begin inside, so Catherine, Leo, Amanda, shall we?

AMANDA	Inside, where it’s warm.

CATHERINE	I don’t see what’s so interesting about people wrapping presents anyway.

STANLEY	Nor do I. I find you to be a much more interesting subject, Madam.

CATHERINE	Thank you, Stanley.

QUEEN GLORIANA	So, you all have three minutes to wrap your gifts as best you can. On your marks, get set… GO!	

QUEEN GLORIANA	Do you have enough wrapping paper?

GIRL 1	Yeah. 

QUEEN GLORIANA	Oh, careful of the end, there. It’s sticking out a bit.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	OK. I’m going to go and help her. Hello.

GIRL 1	Hi.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Right. I’m going to give you a hand, here. If we work really hard…

GIRL 1	I know.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Good luck, boys. You have two minutes remaining.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	How do we put this on? All right, now put that here. Yeah, get another bit there.

GIRL 1	Hey, isn’t that cheating?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Well, it’s our Christmas secret.

GIRL 1	More paper.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Yeah, yeah.

QUEEN GLORIANA	OK.

GIRL 1	Oh, no!

QUEEN GLORIANA	Are you ready?

GIRL 1	No. I’m not done.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Three…

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Quick, quick, quick!	

QUEEN GLORIANA	…two… one… Stop wrapping! Oh, well, I declare contestant number two to be the winner. Congratulations. All of these gifts are yours.

SUNNY	Hey! Those pictures you sent me are really good.

AMANDA	Really? You really think so?

SUNNY	No doubt about it. Tell me: who is the hunk?

AMANDA	I assume you’re referring to Prince Leopold?

SUNNY	He’s a prince? Nice.

AMANDA	Yes. And he’s engaged.

SUNNY	To whom?

AMANDA	To a Duchess. Not that I care, or anything, because I’m just here to work. Do my job. Well, Bitterly’s job.

SUNNY	That’s right. Keep your eye on the prize and don’t get distracted. 

AMANDA	I’m not.

SUNNY	Good. You know, single, handsome princes come and go every day.

AMANDA	Exactly. What do I care he’s engaged?

SUNNY	You already said that.

AMANDA	Right. So let’s drop it.

SUNNY	Dropped.  Now, what’s up next?

AMANDA	The Christmas Baking Competition. Best dessert wins.

SUNNY	Hey, you could do your dad’s chocolate recipe. Maybe add a little bit of sugar.

AMANDA	Do not talk to me about sugar. You should see what they do to the coffee here. And no, I won’t be competing, because I am here to shoot.

SUNNY	You’re a woman of many talents, Mandy. Don’t forget it.

AMANDA	Yeah, and currently of many identities, thanks to you.

SUNNY	Just go with the flow. You’ll be fine. I love you.

AMANDA	What flow? There is no flow.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	All right.

AMANDA	Oops.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Good match, Sven. That’s enough for today. Next!

AMANDA	Sorry. I think I distracted you.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Yes. You certainly are a distraction. But these are just friendly matches. And I won the first 14.

AMANDA	Oh.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	So, what brings you here?

AMANDA	Your dad said you’d be here. Everybody’s busy baking, so I thought I’d come and check you out. I did not mean that like that. I meant, check out the gym, check out the space, the location. It’s big. And anyway, everybody is making desserts and there is nothing much to take photographs of until they’re done.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Oh, yes. I think even Catherine is making her famous gingerbread cookies.

AMANDA	Oh.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Do you bake?

AMANDA	A little bit. My dad was actually the chef of the family. He cooked his way through college.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Oh, so your mother’s the photographer?

AMANDA	No, she teaches first grade. I don’t know why I got into photography. I guess… I don’t know, to see the world through different eyes.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	The definition of a true artist.

AMANDA	Thank you.

CATHERINE	Leo!

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Oh, dear. Are you all right?

CATHERINE	Yeah, I’ve… Yeah, I think I became dizzy slaving over the hot stove all morning. I baked cookies. Gingerbread.

AMANDA	They sound delicious.

CATHERINE	I don’t suppose you cook?

AMANDA	Well, on occasion. 

CATHERINE	Well you should join the baking competition. But I do warn you, my cookies are hard to beat.

AMANDA	Oh, I’ve got to take pictures.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Yes, but not until after the guests arrive with their desserts. You have time. And my permission.

CATHERINE	And to be willing to get your hands dirty, like me.

AMANDA	OK. Lead me to the kitchen.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Leopold, what are you doing?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I was just going to help Amanda.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Kitchen work is not the duty of princes.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Amanda’s father was a famous chef.

AMANDA	Oh, I never said that.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Be that as it may, Amanda’s father will never be king of Pantrea.

AMANDA	It’s OK. I’ve got this. My dad would make a terrible king. He loves mowing his own lawn.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Shouldn’t you be photographing this event, my dear?

AMANDA	Yes. On it.

KING BUCKLEY	Welcome, one and all, to the second day of our competition. The best holiday sweet maker will win a stocking full of goodies to hang over the fireplace. So, let the judging begin.

STANLEY	I can be the official taster, Sire.

KING BUCKLEY	No, Stanley. This is definitely a job for the King. Ah, gingerbread. My favorite.

CATHERINE	I know.

KING BUCKLEY	Very… very nice, Catherine. A little crunchy, perhaps.

CATHERINE	Crunchy? That’s ridiculous.

KING BUCKLEY	Fruity. My, my. Yes, a little dry maybe.

STANLEY	I did try to warn him.

KING BUCKLEY	Nice. Oh, look at this. What an awful lot of effort. Very good. Very good, indeed. Yes, “A” for effort, I would say. Congratulations. Now, what have we here?

AMANDA	Be careful. It’s really hot.

KING BUCKLEY	What an unusual flavor. Sweet and amazing. Yes, it’s… That is absolutely delicious. I declare Amanda Eastman’s hot cocoa the winner. Well done. Bravo. Please, please. Come, come, try. Come and have a try. Some more cups, please. Well done. Now, here we are. Yes, please. One for you. Would you like to try that?

CATHERINE	Stanley.

STANLEY	Yes, my Duchess?

CATHERINE	Can I ask you a favor?

STANLEY	Anything, any time.

KING BUCKLEY	Ah, here we are. Now…

CATHERINE	Keep your eyes on that girl. I do not trust her.

KING BUCKLEY	Would you like a little taste?

STANLEY	Beatrice Bitterly?

CATHERINE	I thought her name was Amanda?

STANLEY	Yes, but she travels incognito. 

CATHERINE	Interesting.

KING BUCKLEY	Now, remember. All those competing in the next event, “Build the Best Snowman”, change into your snow gear and meet up at Pantrea’s Peak in one hour where I, your King, will be joining the competing teams.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Which you promised not to do.

KING BUCKLEY	I promised no such thing.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I don’t think it’s right for the King to take part in this.

KING BUCKLEY	Nonsense. A king should always remain connected to his community.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I would not take photographs of this particular moment.

AMANDA	Oh, right. Yeah. I guess even a king and queen are entitled to their marital spats every now and then.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Unfortunately, over the last few years, it’s become far more “now” than “then”.

AMANDA	Well you should see my parents go at it. It’s totally normal. Love always wins out in the end.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I hope so.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Besides, I don’t consider your obsession with this movie, Frozen, to be a healthy one.

KING BUCKLEY	Let it go, Glory. Let it go.

CATHERINE	Darling, can I speak with you a moment? I’m not feeling so well.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	What is it, Catherine?

CATHERINE	Just this.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Is that all?

CATHERINE	I just wanted to show you how much I love you and how much of a perfect couple we make.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Catherine, Leopold. These public displays of affection are not proper for the royal family.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Yes, mother. But aren’t public displays of disagreement between a king and queen also frowned upon?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Catherine, might I have a moment?

CATHERINE	Certainly, my Queen.

QUEEN GLORIANA	You love my son, do you not?

CATHERINE	Oh, I do, my Queen.

QUEEN GLORIANA	And he, in turn, loves you?

CATHERINE	He’d be a fool not to. I mean, yes, I’m sure that he does. He tells me so often.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Then why has a wedding date not been announced?

CATHERINE	Because the Prince is a very busy man.

QUEEN GLORIANA	He’s not that busy.

CATHERINE	I’m working on it.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Work harder. This marriage is important for both our kingdoms.

CATHERINE	Yes, I’m all for it. Ready and willing. “Chomping at the bit” as they say in the royal stables. You know, to the horses.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I trust you do not chomp, my dear.

CATHERINE	No. Just ride, occasionally, in a very regal manner.

AMANDA	Oh, I’ve actually taken lots of pictures. Some great ones of your dad.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	No need to apologize. This is why you’re here.

AMANDA	Yes. This is why I’m here: to take pictures. And not get distracted.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	What was that?

AMANDA	Um, I was just saying, it’s distracting how beautiful it is. It’s perfect.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You know, in the summertime, they call this spot “Lovers’ Paradise”.

AMANDA	Right. I really know how to pick them.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You have a good eye.

AMANDA	So do you. Two in fact. Great cheekbones, nice nose and cute lips.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Thank you. Amanda.

AMANDA	Yes?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	 I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.

AMANDA	Oh boy. Here it comes.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Excuse me?

AMANDA	I know where this is going.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I’m not sure I’m following you.

AMANDA	You’re getting married to Catherine, the Duchess of Canterbury.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Carthia. 

AMANDA	Close enough.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Right… So what does Catherine have to do with any of this? You know, I was just going to ask if you’d be so kind as to not take any pictures of tomorrow night’s event. At least, avoid photographing me.

AMANDA	Why? What’s tomorrow night?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	The raffle. The winner gets a dance with the Prince. Me.

AMANDA	Oh, because you can’t dance?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I don’t dance in public with everyone watching me. I freeze up.

AMANDA	I’ve been freezing ever since I got here. Look, dancing is easy. All you’ve got to do is move your arms and shake your body. It’s not like you’ve got to do a waltz or anything.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Well, I mean… it is a royal ball, Amanda. It will be a waltz.

AMANDA	Oh. Then I can’t help you.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I’m just afraid I’m going to make a fool of myself in front of the entire kingdom.

AMANDA	Oh, no. Have you ever seen The King and I?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	The King and you? Doing what?

AMANDA	No, it was a play and then a movie. Never mind. The thing about dancing is, you just have to focus on the other person, so hold eye contact. It’s just all about you and her.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	“Eye contact,” you say?

AMANDA	And now, just focus on me. It’s a lot like fencing, except you have to get closer to your opponent and you try not to stab them with your sword. Let’s forget that analogy. So you hum a waltz, and take the lead.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	OK.

AMANDA	Eye contact.

STANLEY	Prince Leopold! Are you quite all right, Sire? Madam! Is anyone hurt?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	We’re fine, Stanley. Amanda was just giving me some pointers.

STANLEY	My Prince, you are needed to judge the best snowman. The King isn’t able to, since he is in the competition himself.

AMANDA	Duty calls.

STANLEY	Sire, you are, of course, free to choose any snowman you like. Any one at all. That goes without saying. But may I remind you, the King is the lord of the land and as it also happens, your father?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	But I don’t want to appear to be picking favorites, Stanley.

AMANDA	Oh, no. Picking a favorite… that would be too obvious.

STANLEY	Shall we, Sire?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Yeah, go on. Let’s.

STANLEY	Madam?

AMANDA	Yeah. You go, Stanley. “Stab her with your sword?” 

AMANDA	I’m not in love. It’s an infatuation. He’s a prince.

SUNNY	He’s a man, Amanda. Like, you danced with him in the snow.

CATHERINE	They were dancing in the snow?

STANLEY	Yes. But to be fair, Prince Leopold said she was just giving him pointers for the ball.

CATHERINE	I bet she was. Well, from now on, if anyone is giving Leo pointers, it’ll be me. Besides, I’ve got better pointers than she does. Bigger ones, too. I’m a Duchess. She’s an American. There’s no contest.

STANLEY	Well, I couldn’t agree more, Madam.


KING BUCKLEY	I do not understand what is upsetting you so. Beatrice is a very nice and talented young woman. Have you seen the photographs she has taken? They are beautiful.

QUEEN GLORIANA	It’s not right for our son to be gallivanting around with the help.

KING BUCKLEY	She is a guest, Glory.

QUEEN GLORIANA	What she is, is a distraction. I heard the two of them were alone together in the gymnasium earlier today.

KING BUCKLEY	I sent her there to take some photographs. What is wrong with that?

QUEEN GLORIANA	It’s not how things are done.

KING BUCKLEY	Nor was the way we first met. Or have you forgotten?

QUEEN GLORIANA	This isn’t about us. It’s about the future alliances of Pantrea, our son, and that… girl.

AMANDA	I don’t even know if he’s into me.

SUNNY	Well, why don’t you find out?

AMANDA	It’s not my place. He’s engaged. I told you.

SUNNY	Yeah, third time, now.

AMANDA	What’s that supposed to mean?

SUNNY	It means he’s still single. Men have been known to change their minds. And I’m sure princes have, too.

AMANDA	OK, I am not having this conversation. You are a bad influence.

SUNNY	Hey! Sometimes it’s good to be bad.

AMANDA	You’re ridiculous.

CATHERINE	I’m very confident that Leo loves me and he wants what’s best for the kingdom. There’s not a doubt in my mind. Not one single doubt. But tomorrow, Leo will not be dancing with anyone else but me.

STANLEY	Madam, the King has made it perfectly clear there is to be no tampering with the raffle.

CATHERINE	But there won’t be any tampering with the raffle. You will just find out what time the tickets go on sale and you let me know. You can do that, Stanley, can’t you?

STANLEY	Being the Chief of Protocol does give me access to certain privy information.

CATHERINE	I know. And I know I can trust you to be very discrete.

KING BUCKLEY	I’m sure our son will do the right thing, just as his father did many years ago.

QUEEN GLORIANA	That’s what worries me.

KING BUCKLEY	Really? You have regrets?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Of course not. Don’t confuse the issue. I just want what’s best for the kingdom.

KING BUCKLEY	So do I. And for Leo to be happy.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I’m sure Catherine will see to that. And the alliance of these two families is what the kingdom needs. Now, it’s getting late. Big day, tomorrow.

SUNNY	OK, OK. You do what’s right and live happily ever after… by yourself.

AMANDA	Good night, Sunny.

SUNNY	But seriously, those pictures you sent are incredible. Especially the one with the kingdom, like, from the hillside. If it’s OK with you, I want to submit it to my editor. Like, it’s cover-worthy.

AMANDA	Really? Wow. Wait, whose name are you going to use?

SUNNY	Why, yours, of course. Beatrice Bitterly!

AMANDA	It’s Amanda. Amanda! Amanda, Sunny. I’ve got to go.

AMANDA	Oh, hello you. I mean, my Prince… the Prince… Mr. Prince?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Please, call me Leopold. Actually, I prefer Leo.

AMANDA	So do I.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Right. Well, I just wanted to thank you again for the lesson this afternoon. It was very helpful.

AMANDA	You’re welcome. Any time.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Oh, I actually wanted to… give you this.

AMANDA	A raffle ticket?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	For the ball tomorrow night. It’s the least I could do.

AMANDA	I’m honored.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	It’s just one. Like I said, “I don’t play favorites”.

AMANDA	No, because that wouldn’t be proper.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	“Proper” is very important to many in this household. Especially my mother, as I’m sure you’ve overheard.

AMANDA	Yes, well, that’s all moms. It’s not just a queen thing.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Yes, but in America I’m sure they don’t tell you who you must spend the rest of your life with.

AMANDA	I can see the advantages of an arranged marriage. I mean, it takes all the pressure off of you having to make a decision, right? 

PRINCE LEOPOLD	That is entirely not true.

AMANDA	Well at least you get to avoid the dating scene. I mean, in America, it’s a mess. The games people play, the constant mixed-messages… “Is he interested in me? Is he not interested in me? Is a kiss too forward? Is a handshake too timid?” Nobody knows what to do so they all just stand around, awkwardly staring at each other, trying… to decide.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Well… Good night.

AMANDA	Good night.

HENRY	Good morning, Duchess. You’re here bright and early.

CATHERINE	I came straight from my castle this morning. How many tickets are available?

HENRY	I believe at the moment, we have them all: 349.

CATHERINE	Great. I’ll purchase them all.

HENRY	Thank you. The children will greatly appreciate your donation and this kind gesture.

CATHERINE	Oh yes, of course. The children.

HENRY	I guess I get to go home.

AMANDA	Come in. It’s open!

QUEEN GLORIANA	Smile, Leo. You might at least pretend to be happy to be here. That’s much better.	

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Breathtaking. 

AMANDA	Yeah, it is, actually. I can’t breathe at all.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I’m really glad you came.

AMANDA	Really?

CATHERINE	Hi.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Catherine is here. Leopold, your fiancée has arrived.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Oh, I should greet her. Excuse me.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Catherine, you look quite striking.

CATHERINE	Oh, I just threw this on. I hope you’re in the mood for dancing, Leo, because I am.

KING BUCKLEY	Good evening, one and all, and welcome. I want to thank you for coming to the palace this evening to celebrate our fourth Christmas event and for contributing so generously to the Children’s Fund. I’m told we’ve raised a tidy sum this year. And that brings us on to tonight’s raffle. The winning ticket will get to dance with the future king of the land: our son, Prince Leopold. And now, our Chief of Protocol, Stanley, will announce the winner.

STANLEY	And the winning raffle ticket is two hundred and…

CATHERINE	That’s me!

STANLEY	…Two hundred and five.

CATHERINE	Yeah, that’s also me.

AMANDA	Oh, it… It’s me.

STANLEY	Would the winning ticket please step forward for confirmation? It seems we have a winner! Congratulations, Madam. And now, Miss Amanda Eastman will join Prince Leopold on the dance floor.

AMANDA	Thank you.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I swear, I did not rig this.

AMANDA	I believe you.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You do?

AMANDA	No. But I don’t mind. Look in my eyes.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I know.

STANLEY	May I please have your attention? Ladies and Gentlemen, her Majesty, Queen Gloriana.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Well, that was simply lovely. And now, I have a very special announcement to make: our son, Prince Leopold, will be before you again on January the 5th, when he takes Duchess Catherine of Carthia’s hand in holy matrimony.

AMANDA	I didn’t know you’d set a date.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Neither did I.

CATHERINE	Excuse me.

WOMAN	How was it, dancing with the prince?

AMANDA	It was a dream. Just a dream.

KING BUCKLEY	Two minutes left, and then the best Christmas card will be awarded.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Amanda, you have to believe me. I had no idea that Mother was going to announce a date last night. We’d not agreed upon anything.

AMANDA	Yeah, it’s fine. I’m not mad at you.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Well, you seem pretty mad.

AMANDA	Do I? I’m not. I’m mad at myself.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Why? You did nothing wrong. I don’t understand.

AMANDA	Yeah, well, it’s probably better that way.

STANLEY	One minute remains. Please finish your cards.

GIRL 2	OK!

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I really wish you would just talk to me.

CATHERINE	Leopold! I’m feeling a bit faint.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Would you like to lie down?



CATHERINE	No. I think I feel better, now that you’re near. Now, we should really start discussing the wedding arrangements. It’s less than two weeks away. And, you know, I don’t think you should keep fraternizing with the help. It’s beneath you, darling. And one must keep up appearances. 

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You know, you sound just like my mother.

CATHERINE	I take that as a compliment.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	It’s not.

STANLEY	And the time is up.

KING BUCKLEY	Good. Let us see what Christmas magic has been created. “I think that I shall never see a card as lovely as a Christmas tree!” Nice.

CATHERINE	I bet “little-miss-perfect” is not so perfect.

SUNNY	Like, dude. I’ve been trying to reach you for days. Hello? Where are you? Are you still mad at me? Is that it? Well then, I’ve got some great news for you. I showed your photographs to my editor and he loved them. He’s going to use them. And guess who he’s giving full photograph credit to? Amanda Eastman! That’s you, girl. The real you. What do you think about that?

CATHERINE	Thank you.

SUNNY	What?

CATHERINE	Hi, I’m looking for a number in the United States, in the State of California. The name is “Beatrice Bitterly”.

KING BUCKLEY	And the best card goes to… Billy Wilkins. Congratulations, Billy. Well done, indeed. Isn’t that good? Really, well done, indeed.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I really think we need to talk.

AMANDA	I don’t think there’s anything to talk about. Last night was wonderful. It really was. But I think we need to get back to the real world. I have a job to do and you have a duchess to marry. Let’s not complicate things.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	But feelings matter, Amanda. Don’t they?

AMANDA	I can’t do this.

AMANDA	I just need to change my camera card. I’ll be back.

AMANDA	Focus. No, no, no, no, no! Where are my pictures? Gone.

KING BUCKLEY	Is something wrong, Son?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Yeah. I need to talk to you and Mother about this wedding.

KING BUCKLEY	I believe she’s upstairs, working on the invitation list.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	OK. Father…

KING BUCKLEY	You’re having reservations about the marriage.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Are you and Mother happy, Father?

KING BUCKLEY	Of course we are. I love your mother very much.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	But I always hear you arguing.

KING BUCKLEY	We do not argue. We may have slight disagreements, but when you live with one for so long, it is bound to happen. In any relationship. It doesn’t mean we don’t love each other. Are you worried that once you’re married, you and Catherine will stop loving each other? Or perhaps you love another?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	What? No, I… I don’t know.

KING BUCKLEY	Yes, you do.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I just don’t want to let you or Mother down.

KING BUCKLEY	Oh, you’ll never let us down, Leo. Never.

QUEEN GLORIANA	You may enter.

AMANDA	Hi. Sorry to disturb you, your Majesty. Was there a power outage earlier?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Not that I’m aware of. Why do you ask?

AMANDA	Oh, something happened with my computer and I lost a lot of my files. All the pictures I’ve been taking.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Do you not make backups?

AMANDA	Oh, I do. And I was when my computer crashed. I was just wondering if I could borrow your system and download the pictures for today. It shouldn’t take longer than 30, 40 minutes tops.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Very well.

AMANDA	I can just… Oh, OK. Thank you.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Your stay here is coming to an end soon.

AMANDA	Yep, right after the last two festivities are over.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I trust your visit has been satisfactory?

AMANDA	It’s been wonderful.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Then why do I detect an air of sadness?

AMANDA	Me? No, I’m fine, really. You have a magnificent palace here, and a wonderful husband, and loyal servants. It really is the dream. And I’m sure the Prince and the Duchess will follow gloriously in your footsteps and live happily ever after.

QUEEN GLORIANA	That is the plan.

AMANDA	Yes, and it’s a top-notch plan. I couldn’t be happier for them. Um… This is going to take a while, so I’ll come back. I have to clean my lenses.

KING BUCKLEY	Welcome, one and all. Christmas Eve is upon us, as are the final two competitions. This evening is the “Christmas Tree Decorating Contest”: the most festive decorating wins.

QUEEN GLORIANA	And tomorrow, Christmas day, everyone can take part in our “Spirit of Christmas Competition”. Pictures, sculptures, costumes… Anything that best represents the joy of our community this holiday season will win a special award. Oh, and contributions are still being accepted to our Children’s Fund, so please, do give what you can.

KING BUCKLEY	Good luck, and may the most festive spirit win.

STANLEY	Thank you. I’ll take over.*** 01:03:36:00

CATHERINE	Forget about her, Leo. She’s not who you think she is.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	What do you mean about that? 

CATHERINE	You’ll see. Everyone will.

KING BUCKLEY	We need to talk about Leo and Catherine.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Oh, not now. There’s so much to do.

CATHERINE	And we’ve still got so much to plan for the wedding. And It’s important. Our families are counting on it.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Catherine, weddings should not be about families. It should be about two people in love. That’s what makes them special.

CATHERINE	And I completely agree. But ours is even more special, because it unites our kingdoms.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Is that how you feel, or how your parents feel?

CATHERINE	Can’t it be both?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I suppose so. Catherine, please. Stop. I need to do this alone.

CATHERINE	What?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Use the restroom facilities.

CATHERINE	Oh, of course. By all means. Hurry back! Miss you already!

CATHERINE	You think you’re so clever, don’t you?

AMANDA	Well that’s not something I’ve ever been accused of.

CATHERINE	Interesting choice of words… “Accused”.

AMANDA	I’m just here doing my job. After tomorrow, I’m gone and the Prince is all yours.

CATHERINE	Oh, he was always mine. I do hope you weren’t foolish enough to believe otherwise.

AMANDA	Yeah. Of course not.

STANLEY	Add more on this one.

CATHERINE	Good evening, Stanley.

STANLEY	Duchess. How can I be of service?

CATHERINE	Actually, a hot cup of cocoa would be wonderful. Would you be a dear?

STANLEY	Well, you could ask Amanda to make you one. I hear she’s… I would love to, but I’m not supposed to leave the box unattended, Madam.

CATHERINE	I’ll wait right here.

STANLEY	Be back in a jiffy. *5 Days of Christmas

AMANDA	Beautiful. Hi.

AMANDA	Can I? Last batch.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Computer still not working?

AMANDA	Well, I don’t want to take any chances. Thank you. OK.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I must admit, your… your work really is very good. You’ve captured the heart and soul of Pantrea. Your work is full of emotion.

AMANDA	Thank you, your Majesty. You’re very kind.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I think my husband and my son would disagree with you.

AMANDA	I doubt that. I know you want what’s best for the kingdom.

QUEEN GLORIANA	You’re very observant, my dear.

AMANDA	Occupational hazard. 

QUEEN GLORIANA	Oh.

KING BUCKLEY	What a pleasant sight to behold.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Richard, come and see these photographs. They really are quite stunning.

AMANDA	Oh, this file is quite big. I’ll come back when it’s finished downloading.

KING BUCKLEY	You will be joining us for brunch tomorrow, won’t you?

AMANDA	Oh my gosh, no! I wouldn’t want to intrude on your family time.

KING BUCKLEY	Nonsense. It is Christmas and while you’re here, you are part of the family.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Yes, do join us.

AMANDA	Oh, wow. That is really so nice of you. OK. Thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow. Ta-ta!

KING BUCKLEY	Ta-ta, indeed.

KING BUCKLEY	I’m glad to see you getting on so well.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I’ve nothing against the girl. She’s lovely and talented. But she’s…

KING BUCKLEY	Not of royal blood?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Exactly.

KING BUCKLEY	And you want what is best for our son?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Correct.

KING BUCKLEY	No matter if his heart loves another?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Has he told you that?

KING BUCKLEY		Not in so many words, but… 

QUEEN GLORIANA	He’s only just met the girl.

KING BUCKLEY	He is in love.

QUEEN GLORIANA	And Catherine is a duchess and will make an excellent queen someday.

KING BUCKLEY	And a suitable wife. But if you recall, I refused my suitable bride who came from royal blood. And why? Because I met a beautiful, young, vibrant girl. Do you remember how brave we both had to be then? They said our marriage would never be allowed. And yet, here we are. Just as in love today as the day we first met. 

QUEEN GLORIANA	That was a different time.

KING BUCKLEY	Time is the only difference.

QUEEN GLORIANA	She’s an American.

KING BUCKLEY	Americans are people, too. Or so I’ve heard.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Yes, thank you for everything.

KING BUCKLEY	Well, I choose.***

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Am I in the wrong castle?

QUEEN GLORIANA	Why would you say that?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Smiling, laughing. Not squabbling.

KING BUCKLEY	Well, we can squabble if you want, Leo. 

PRINCE LEOPOLD	This is nice.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Will Catherine be joining us?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Oh, sooner or later. She… said she has some sort of errand to attend to first.

KING BUCKLEY	Perhaps you’d like to fetch Amanda?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I don’t think she wants anything to do with me.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I think just the opposite.

AMANDA	Merry Christmas.

KING BUCKLEY	Merry, indeed.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I really must speak with you.

AMANDA	Yes, before you do, there’s something I have to say to all of you.

KING BUCKLEY	What is it, my dear?

AMANDA	Uh, well, firstly, thank you. You’ve all been so kind, inviting me into your home and you’ve treated me like an honored guest. And at first, I was confused, because I thought you were expecting me. 

KING BUCKLEY	We were expecting you.

AMANDA	No, you weren’t. Not “me” me.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Who’s “Mimi”?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Another pseudonym?


AMANDA	No. There’s no “Mimi”. Just “me, me”.

KING BUCKLEY	“Beatrice Bitterly?”

BEATRICE	Present.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Who is this woman?

BEATRICE	Amanda Eastman. 

KING BUCKLEY	You’re Amanda Eastman?

CATHERINE	No. She is.

BEATRICE	I am Beatrice Bitterly.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I am confused.

CATHERINE	That woman has been lying to us all by pretending to be this woman: the real Beatrice Bitterly.

BEATRICE	And I’m bitterly disappointed, Amanda. She’s my assistant. Was my assistant.  As soon as I received a call from the Duchess telling me what Amanda was up to, I hopped on the first plane to set things right.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You lied to me?

AMANDA	No. I actually asked you all to call me “Amanda”.

KING BUCKLEY	But we never thought your real name was your real name. 

AMANDA	Well, it was just a case of mistaken identity that spiraled out of control. 

CATHERINE	Oh, you were dishonest from the very beginning. Capitalizing on a famous name to make a name for yourself. I mean, did you really think King Buckley would invite you, a lowly assistant, into his royal palace?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You could’ve told me.

AMANDA	I tried. I tried to try, but it was…

STANLEY	I’m afraid we have a bit of an issue, Sire.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Who in this kingdom would steal from children?

CATHERINE	I wonder?

AMANDA	No, no, no, no. I have nothing to do with this.

CATHERINE	And why should we believe you? I mean, you probably stole that dress.

AMANDA	No, I didn’t. This was a gift. I guess? You can search me. Search my things. Search my room!

CATHERINE	Oh, I think that’s a very good idea.

AMANDA	You have to… Stanley? OK.

GUARD	The room is clear.

STANLEY	It’s all here.

AMANDA	You did this. You set me up.

CATHERINE	Me? I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’d have this woman arrested. 

BEATRICE	A liar and a thief? Really, Amanda? It’s like I didn’t even know you.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	It seems like none of us did.

KING BUCKLEY	Well, we have retrieved the money. I do not think we need to involve the authorities in this.

QUEEN GLORIANA	No. The last thing this kingdom needs is a scandal.

BEATRICE	I’m shocked. Unbelievable. I’ll make sure you’ll never get hired again. 

KING BUCKLEY	Well, I think the best thing would be if Aman… It is Amanda? …if Amanda got the first flight back to the States.

QUEEN GLORIANA	I concur.

KING BUCKLEY	Stanley, you’ll see that she gets to the airport?

STANLEY	Very well, Sire.

CATHERINE	Come on, Leo. We’ve wasted enough time on this… this woman. 

STANLEY	Madam.

AMANDA	I didn’t do this, you know.

BEATRICE	You’re welcome to dine with us, Miss Bitterly.

BEATRICE	Well, thank you. I’m starved. I can never eat that airplane food. And they make the worst coffee. Never enough sugar. 

STANLEY	You let me know when you are ready.

AMANDA	Thanks, Stanley.

AMANDA	I didn’t take that money, you know.

STANLEY	I believe you, Madam. I truly do.

CATHERINE	Oh, I love them, Leo. Thank you so much. They’re beautiful.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I told you. They’re not from me.

CATHERINE	Don’t be ridiculous. Who else in the palace would be my secret admirer?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I never even said good-bye to her.

CATHERINE	You are not still going on about that silly little thief, are you? She was a menace. We should celebrate being rid of her. And she got off easy. I would have got her serving time for her actions. 

PRINCE LEOPOLD	It’s Christmas, Catherine. A time for giving and forgiving.

QUEEN GLORIANA	And this is my den.

BEATRICE	So clean and tidy. You should see mine. It’s cluttered. But ‘tis the life of an artist.

QUEEN GLORIANA	She’s left her pictures behind. 

BEATRICE	I’m sure they’re horrible. The poor girl probably didn’t even know which end of the camera to shoot from.

KING BUCKLEY	Actually, we found her photographs to be rather good.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Excellent, I would say. Richard, come here. How do you enlarge a photograph?

KING BUCKLEY	Oh, well you just hit this key. What is it you want to enlarge? Is that…?	

QUEEN GLORIANA	I think it is.

CATHERINE	You’re breaking up with me?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	You’ll find another prince.

CATHERINE	Where? I love you!

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Catherine, honestly, I think you love the idea of being a queen. But me? Not so much. And if I’m being really honest with myself, I’m in love with Amanda.

CATHERINE	But she’s a liar. You were promised to me, and I to you, when we were children. I can’t believe you’re in love with a thief.

QUEEN	There’s only one thief in this palace.

KING BUCKLEY	And it is not Amanda Eastman.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Oh, we should…

STANLEY	Madam, may I say, I regret things had to end this way.

AMANDA	Yeah, me too, Stanley. But I guess Christmas wishes are just that, huh? “Wishes”.

STANLEY	Stanley Bishop, Chief of Protocol. Yes, we’re almost there, Sire. Yes. Yes, of course. Absolutely, Sire. Right away.

AMANDA	Uh… Am I in trouble again?

KING BUCKLEY	Yes. There’s one more competition to judge: “Pantrea’s Spirit of Christmas.”

QUEEN GLORIANA	The submissions are in the great hall and you haven’t photographed there yet.

BEATRICE	I can photograph this, and I’ll only charge you half my normal rate.

KING BUCKLEY	No, thank you. We want Amanda.

AMANDA	You do?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I do.

AMANDA	I don’t understand.

QUEEN GLORIANA	We saw your pictures. 

AMANDA	Oh.

CATHERINE	It was mostly my money in that stupid raffle. I just want to be queen. Is that too much to ask?

KING BUCKLEY	It is in Pantrea.

CATHERINE	Well, when my father hears about this, he will… He will demand that you return his wedding gift.

KING BUCKLEY	That alone is cause to celebrate.

QUEEN GLORIANA	Would you like us to lock her up? After all, it’s what she wanted us to do with you.

AMANDA	No, it’s Christmas. And besides, she returned the money when she pointed out where to find it.

KING BUCKLEY	That’s true. Let her go.

CATHERINE	Thank you, your Royal Highness. I didn’t mean to do any harm. I just really wanted to be queen to make my parents proud. It’s how I was raised. And now you all hate me.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	I don’t hate you, Catherine. You’re just not the right one for me. But I think I know who is. Amanda, I… Looks like I’ve fallen for you.

AMANDA	That’s the third time. You know what they say: “Three time’s a charm.” *Better Ways &Weddings: Paradise in Pantrea

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Can you ever forgive me?

AMANDA	For what?

PRINCE LEOPOLD	For doubting you. Stanley told me how special you are. I should have listened to him.

AMANDA	Just hold that thought. Stanley, that was you who brought me the dresses the other night, wasn’t it?

STANLEY	I couldn’t really say, Madam.

AMANDA	And the winning ticket?

STANLEY	It would be a nice gesture to give for helping you.

STANLEY	And the winning raffle ticket is 205.

AMANDA	You little matchmaker, you.

STANLEY	Things we do for love.

AMANDA	I think the Duchess might need a ride home.

STANLEY	And I believe you may be right, Madam.

STANLEY	Sire, I believe the Duchess might need a ride back to her kingdom.

KING BUCKLEY	You’re right, Stanley. Could you?

STANLEY	It would be my pleasure, Sire. Madam.

CATHERINE	Thank you, Stanley. I wonder who did send me these earrings. A secret admirer?

STANLEY	Perhaps we could figure that one out together.

KING BUCKLEY	Well, I think we found the winner that best represents the spirit of Christmas. *Better Ways & Weddings, Paradise in Pantrea: Where to spend your next holiday vacation

AMANDA	Yes!

SUNNY	Oh, finally! Did you get the package I sent you?

AMANDA	Yes!

SUNNY	It’s an advanced copy. The magazine hits the stands next week. All photos credited to you, baby. Amanda Eastman!

BEATRICE	So you know how to take a picture? You’re never working for me again.

AMANDA	Well, with all due respect, Beatrice, I don’t need to. I have my own name, now.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	Oh, and you’re sticking to it?

AMANDA	Yeah. I wouldn’t want to be anyone else.

PRINCE LEOPOLD	How about Princess Amanda?

AMANDA	“Princess Amanda.” That has a nice ring to it. I’ll think about it.

PEOPLE	Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
