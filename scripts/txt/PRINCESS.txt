KING	I, King Robert, eight of my name, ruler of the Kingdom of Aspania, and lord of Rivertrine castle, address you, Noble kings, with an urgent message.  My only daughter, Princess Ellen, is turning  in three weeks’ time.  With her coming birthday, the old threat, arrives as well.  As you know, a witch, feared also in your lands, has taken her revenge upon me. Murien. Almost twenty years ago she took my wife and put a curse upon my daughter. We’ve been attempting to free Ellen, and to break the spell for many years. However, just tonight, our Chief Alchemist has found a book in an almost forgotten language there fore I am writing you. Noble Kings, this spell can be broken, but I urgently need your help. At dawn, our messengers will set off to deliver this message to you: I promise half a kingdom to the Prince who would win my daughter’s heart and thus avert the danger that has been threatening us for the past twenty years.

PRINCE	Father, I must go. 

PRINCE	Hiyah, hup!.

PRINCE	We have a long way to go. Let's go

PRINCE	Giddy-up!

KING	And mind the words of the alchemists: “When above our lands the flocking crows fly, they look down upon us with wicked Murien’s eye.”

PRINCESS	yuch, yesterday’s rose. 

GUARD	Oh, The Princess is up.

GUARD MARTIN	Here we go, listen up! And so the hunter stood face to face with the witch. He drew his longbow  and took aim at her crystal and fired

GUARD MARTIN	Good morning, Princess. 
 
PRINCESS	How come I'm princess? When you say my “Good Morning” You should address me as Your Highness

GUARD MARTIN	I wish you a very happy birthday your highness

GUARD HARRY	Happy Birthday.

GUARD MARTIN	Oh, I forgot, this Harry, your new guard. A fresh recruit to the Palace Guard

GUARD HARRY	I am honoured, Your Highness.  

PRINCESS	So we're short staffed now

GUARD MARTIN	His predecessor has fled the castle. You know why.

PRINCESS	Gentlemen, Perhaps I could at least spend my birthday on my own. I can’t leave the castle today. I already have a nanny

GUARD HARRY	Wait! I am sorry, Princess…Your Highness. 

GUARD HARRY	The king has ordered us to guard you the whole day. Princess!

NANNY	Ah, our “bowlady”. Grownup today.

COOK	I’m not sticking around to see if this curse is real!

NANNY	That’s third one today…

PRINCESS	All this for my birthday? 

NANNY	Yes. Just a few details and it’s be ready. 

NANNY	Have some, if you like. 

PRINCESS	How would I look, if I ate everything you gave me to eat? 

PRINCESS	What use is all this celebration when the curse is going to come anyway

NANNY	oh Don't joke. It's not funny The feast is also for your suitors.

PRINCESS	Aha! The suitors. The Princes are a desperate attempt to break the curse.

NANNY	Oh and, a dove has brought a message…Prince John is on his way. 

COOK	Flour.

PRINCESS	Ugh, he’s the worst one. He doesn’t fancy me anyway…I think he thinks I’m arrogant. 

NANNY	Arrogant!… Where on earth would he get that idea from?

PRINCESS	Weird, isn’t it. Because he would say I was beautiful and sweet and I would say… 

PRINCESS	Well of course I am

PRINCESS	He has no sense of humour.  

NANNY	Oh yes. That reminds me that I need some more of those apples for the strudel. Alena!

ALENA	Yes?

PRINCESS	No, don’t send her. You won’t have anyone here to help

NANNY	And who else would do the shopping

PRINCESS	Me!

NANNY	My dear, you must stay in the castle today

PRINCESS	The market is technically…inside the castle.  

NANNY	No! 

PRINCESS	Shopping list in the same place every day.

NANNY	 You're not going anywhere! You know what’s supposed to happen today.

PRINCESS	“Chm…“

GUARD MARTIN	You Highness! You can’t leave the castle! Wait!

PRINCESS	And who else would go shopping? 

LADY IN YELLOW	Your Highness.

LADY	Cheese! Cheese! Come taste our cheese!

MARTIN	Who is she going to annoy this time?

LADY AT THE MARKET	Happy birthday, Your Highness. 

MARIKA	Happy birthday, Your Highness. 

JUGGLER	Only four groschen to win many times more. Solve my riddle and you’re a winner. That’s all there is to it.  Very well, young man, step right up if you think you can outsmart me!

JANE	Don’t you dare lose!  

THOMAS	I won’t!

JUGGLER	Young man, you look smart. My riddles are easy! Listen carefully. No one has ever seen it, yet it’s all around us. Loved by some, but hated by others…

STALLHOLDER	Have a good day.

JUGGLER	…When you say its name, it disappears. So what is it? Any guesses?

MARTHA	Good morning, Your Highness.  

PRINCESS	Is it? What's good about it? I haven’t smiled yet. 

PRINCESS	So, I will have…

MARTHA	That will be  groschen in total

MARTIN	And one for you, young lady. 

MARTHA	Thank you

MARTHA	Princess? Can I ask you something?  

PRINCESS	Of course. 

MARTHA	Aren’t you at all afraid of tonight? 

PRINCESS	Let’s go. 

JUGGLER	I am sorry, gentlemen, but all your groschen ..are mine. Thank you.

JANE	Great! What now? 

THOMAS	We will try it again. 

JANE	Are you crazy? We have no more money. You should have solved the riddle. It was so easy! Silence!

THOMAS	Whatever...

JUGGLER	My riddles are easy! 

CHAMBERLAIN	The Court’s Alchemist, Archibald.

ARCHIBALD	Your Majesty? 

KING	There have been rumours in the neighbouring kingdoms…about a ghostly woman with a flock of crows. Is that what we feared, my friend? Could she be back?

ARCHIBALD	“When above our lands the flocking crows fly…”

KING	Archibald! I don’t need poetry…What I need is hope. 

ARCHIBALD	I know…everything is under control. The guards have been doubled, the Witch Hunters are awaiting audience and tonight, I will accompany you at the feast. 

KING	And the princes? How many are we expecting? 

ARCHIBALD	Only one accepted... Prince John.

KING	Only Prince John? 

GUARD MARTIN	So, here you are! Come on! Come on!

NANNY	What is all this? Wait a minute, where are the apples for the strudel? 

PRINCESS	Well, Martha must have forgotten.

NANNY	Huh, thanks for all this anyway

GUARD MARTIN	Yeah! Hurry, Harry!

NANNY	What about Prince John? He is from a good family and he is so manly…

PRINCESS	Will you stop it ? Manly…?

NANNY	I didn’t say that much.

CHAMBERLAIN	Prince John of Calderon.

KING	Welcome, dear Prince. 

PRINCE	Your Majesty. 

KING	How is your father? Is he well?

PRINCE	He is good. Very well. Although he would be happier if I stayed home. 

KING	He’s not worried for you. I have heard it said that you happen to be a master swordsman. There is still time to leave…

PRINCE	A long time ago, I made a promise to the Princess. I mean to keep it.

KING	You’re a man of your word, I appreciate that…Alright. There’s no time to waste, so let’s come to the point. 

ARCHIBALD	Yes. After years of searching, we have finally found an ancient text that gives us a ray of hope “Even the most powerful curse can be broken by a love that is stronger than the fear of one’s death.”

KING	True Love. Brave and pure. With no fear of death.

PRINCE	I see. Uh, and so what do you need me to do?

KING	As I remember, you were quite close to Ellen when you were both children.

KING	Try to awake the love in her. A kiss... should be enough. 

KING	Yes? 

CHAMBERLAIN	The Witch Hunters.

WITCH HUNTER	Your Majesty.

WITCH HUNTER	Your Majesty.

PRINCE	In case I fail?

PRINCESS	I thought you fled the kingdom as well. And you’re just late.

AMELIA	Somebody has to stay with you. 

AMELIA	So you’ve accepted the curse? 

PRINCESS	Again?! Nobody even knows whether the witch cursed me or not. The only two men claiming it

BOTH	…are my father and Archibald. 

PRINCESS	Elbow…No, not enough, even more…Good.

PRINCESS	So it wasn’t the elbow.

AMELIA	You don’t believe it yourself. How else would they come up with the spell? “…as the sun finally disappears behind the third mountain, “the castle will be consumed by darkness.”

PRINCESS	Great. And why do you keep bringing this up?

AMELIA	I'm just wondering if it still bothers you

PRINCESS	Bothers me? It’s useless to close your eye. Aim with both of them.

AMELIA	Then you believe something will happen tonight. 

PRINCESS	Sure...A prince will kiss me.. 

AMELIA	Maybe it’s you who needs to open both eyes, Ellen. And not rely on others. 

PRINCESS	It’s too late for that. What is meant to happen will happen.

AMELIA	Good afternoon, Your Highness. How can I help you? 

PRINCE	I'm here to see the princess.

AMELIA	I'm sorry to disappoint you but the princess is trying on her evening dress and ah.... 

PRINCESS	I can’t tie this corset. 

AMELIA	She is undressed. 

PRINCESS	Did it shrink?

AMELIA	So you shall meet her at the feast tonight.

PRINCESS	 Amelia!

AMELIA	Thanks.

PRINCE	That went well.

AMELIA	Do you want a rose?

PRINCESS	Sweet. In the vase.

AMELIA	You’re not gonna like this, but he was dressed in his family’s colours. 

PRINCESS	Are you kidding? But I always wear red.

CHAMBERLAIN	Please rise! Her Highness, Ellen of Aspanina.

PRINCE	I am honoured, 

AMELIA	Here it comes!

NANNY	Amelia!

CHAMBERLAIN	Silence, please. King Robert, Eighth of his name.

KING	I would like to propose a toast to my only daughter, on her twentieth birthday. She has suffered all these years worried her life is cursed by the spell of the wicked witch. Almost half of the kingdom has fled during that time, And I must thank you all, that you are here with us sharing this inglorious evening. Please, raise your glasses to our Princess on her coming of age.  And moreover, since Prince John is at our table let us toast to the rediscovered friendship and cooperation between our kingdoms. 

MURIEN	“I doom your daughter to a childhood in fear. On the day the princess marks her coming of age, as the sun finally sets behind the third mountain, the castle will be consumed by darkness.”

KING	The Black Storm… You must kiss! At once!

ARCHIBALD	Perhaps...I didn’t think this through... 

PRINCESS	 It’s white?

GUARD	Oh, the Princess is up

GUARD MARTIN	“And so the hunter stood face to face the the witch. He drew his longbow. Took aim at her crystal. And fired.” Good morning, Princess 

PRINCESS	I told you yesterday – “Your Highness”!

GUARD MARTIN	Yesterday I wasn’t here…A Very Happy birthday, Your Highness!

PRINCESS	Birthdays are once a year, right?

GUARD HARRY	Are you well Princess? 

GUARD MARTIN	Oh, I forgot, this is Harry, your new guard. A fresh recruit to the …palace gua...

PRINCESS	…palace guard.

NANNY	Our “bowlady”. Grown up today.

COOK	I’m not sticking around to see if this stupid curse is real!

NANNY	That's the third one today

PRINCESS	 Is that for my birthday?

NANNY	 Of course. Just a few details and it’s ready.  Something wrong? 

PRINCESS	I’ve gotta go.

NANNY	Where to?

PRINCESS	To the market. 

GUARD MARTIN	You can’t leave the castle!

LADY IN YELLOW	Your Highness.

JUGGLER	Only four groschen to win many times more. Just solve my riddle and you're a winner That's all there is to it. Yeah?

THOMAS	We don’t have money for shoes for all our children. I gotta try it.

JANE	Sophie needs them the most. The boys can wait one more winter. Don’t you dare lose!

THOMAS	I won’t!  C’mon. You know I am good at riddles.

JUGGLER	Come on forward. Place your bets. Only four groschen and you could win large!

MARTHA	A very good morning, Your Highness

PRINCESS	No one has seen it, yet it’s all around us. Loved by some, hated by others. 

MARTHA	Princess?

JUGGLER	Listen carefully! No one has ever seen it, yet it’s all around us. Loved by some and hated by others. When you say its name….pffff! It disappears. What is it?

GUARD MARTIN	So, here you are. 

NANNY	Where are the apples for the strudel?

PRINCESS	 The apples...didn't have any

NANNY	And what about Prince John?

PRINCESS	 Prince John? I don’t like him.. And he’s not ...manly!

AMELIA	Want a rose?

PRINCESS	The vase by the window. 

AMELIA	Didn’t you say you weren’t going to wear the red dress again? That that’s what you always wear?

PRINCESS	What was the Prince wearing? Red…the rose is red. 

CHAMBERLAIN	Silence, please.

KING	I would like to propose a toast to my only daughter

PRINCESS	Again? It is so white.

GUARD	Charlie! Are you ok? 

PRINCESS	You’ve got to be kidding!!! 

GUARD MARTIN	“...he drew his longbow, took aim at her crystal, and...”

PRINCESS	“and fired!” 

GUARD MARTIN	Princess, happy birthday

PRINCESS	 It's your highness!

NANNY	Our… 

PRINCESS	Aaaaa!  “Our bowlady! Grownup today.” Again! Where are you going? Run, run, the Black Storm is coming!

NANNY	The Black Storm? What is wrong with you? 

PRINCESS	Do you know how I knew you were just about to say “bowlady”? 

NANNY	I use that all the time.

PRINCESS	No, that’s not it! 

NANNY	Ok,  how did you know?

PRINCESS	Because I am living today over and over again. I am twenty for the third time!

NANNY	Twenty. Three times. Great! Then we need more candles for your cake.

PRINCESS	I’m not reliving the last twenty years. It is only one day, today.

NANNY	Ellen, dear. I can see it in your face. You’re afraid of tonight. That’s perfectly natural, my child. You’ve been waiting twenty years to find out whether the curse would come true..

PRINCESS	You must listen to what I'm saying.

NANNY	All right. I’m listening. 

PRINCESS	Oh! The market!

NANNY	Market?

PRINCESS	You need the shopping? How would I know that? Here is the shopping list with everything that you need, including   plums,  cucumbers,  parsley roots, …

NANNY	Stop! What kind of nonsense is this? And you forgot about the apples.

PRINCESS	Ah! The apples!

NANNY	I put the list there every morning, so that I won’t forget anything. And the cooks or the other kitchen help do the shopping for me. 

PRINCESS	But yesterday you sent me today! 

NANNY	You? You aren’t allowed to leave the castle. Ellen, are you sure you’re feeling well. What is really going on here? 

AMELIA	Are you kidding? Ellie, I know you are afraid of  tonight, but you can’t be serious. Does the curse even mention repetition? No!

NANNY	What are you giving up?

PRINCESS	Today…why it can't be tomorrow? At least I wouldn’t be stuck here inside the castle.

NANNY	With that kind of attitude you will be unhappy no matter where you are. 

PRINCESS	At least I could ride the horse through the plains, the mountains, the rivers…

NANNY	Ellen, Don’t get hung up on where you’d rather be, or you’ll forget how to make the most of today.  

PRINCESS	Today? Are you serious?

NANNY	Remember. When you were a child. You’d find something good in every day…Live a little! 

PRINCESS	"Live a little."

PRINCE	I...

PRINCESS	 You are honoured, I know.: and you're waiting for that special kiss, hmm?

KING	What do you think you’re doing? 

PRINCESS	So everyone, before my dear father hurries Prince John to kiss me, which actually turns out to be sweet but useless… and before our kingdom returns unto dust, my father would like to toast to my birthday. 

CHAMBERLAIN	Silence, please. King Robert, Eighth of his name.

KING	I would like to propose a toast to my...my only daughter, on her twentieth birthday. 

AMELIA and PRINCESS	blow kisses to each other

NANNY	Cut it out!

KING	She has suffered all these years with worries that her life is cursed by the spell of the wicked witch.:

PRINCESS	Boring!

KING	Almost half the kingdom has fled during that time and I must thank you all that you are here with us sharing this inglorious evening.

PRINCESS	Here it comes... 

KING	For staying with us even today. Please, let’s raise our glasses to our princess on her coming of age. 

PRINCESS	Here it comes.

PRINCESS	Missed me! 

PRINCESS	Catch the mouse.

PRINCESS	The end.

GUARD MARTIN	Princess…wait! 

AMELIA	You wanted to see me?: Careful you don't get fat.

PRINCESS	I won’t in one day.  Come on!

PRINCESS	Not bad!

PRINCESS	Ah, watch out. Incoming. Let’s blow it up…And blow it out again. 

GUARD	Princess, you mustn’t leave the castle!

PRINCESS	Wooo-Hooo!

AMELIA	Then you believe something is going to happen tonight.

PRINCESS	Yes, a kiss!.

LADY IN YELLOW	Your Highness. 

PRINCESS	And again.

JUGGLER	Dear folks, solve my riddle and you're a winner. That’s all there is to it! No one has seen it, yet it’s often here.

PRINCESS	Silence!

CROWD	Bravo!

JUGGLER	Excellent, Your Highness! 

PRINCESS	Have you ever thought about why things happen to people? 

PRINCESS	 There is no sense in anything I do. Amelia, to what good are all the adventures when I can’t share them? 

AMELIA	You can share them with me. 

PRINCESS	Trouble is you forget them every night.

PRINCESS	I keep living this day over and over again.

NANNY	Ellen.

PRINCESS	Hang on. Yes, you heard me correctly. And no, I am not afraid of today. Let me prove it to you. How, you may ask? There are six cloves of garlic in your hand…you have three groschen and you need apples for the strudel.

NANNY	Okay…you have my attention.

PRINCESS	So the groschen made you believe me? Huh. Where to begin? 

NANNY	If I understand correctly, Prince John is coming here this evening so he can break the curse. That should do the trick, I think.

PRINCESS	Only it won’t. Do you know how many times I’ve had his useless kiss?  

NANNY	Useless kiss? But I’m talking about love, my dear!

PRINCESS	But Archibald said that you…

NANNY	Archibald, Archibald? That useless old fool? He knows nothing about love. 

PRINCESS	So what then? 

NANNY	Alright, once again…“Love will break the curse.”

SERVANT	Someone to see you, Your Highness. It’s Her Highness, Princess Ellen. Please, come in.

PRINCE	send her in.

PRINCE	My lady. 

PRINCESS	My lord. Even though our last meeting was kind of a failure…Would you kindly accept my invitation for an afternoon of archery and some Aspanian wine?  

PRINCE	Unfortunately, I am not an archer but a swordsman. But I’d be happy to spend some time with you anyway.

PRINCE	My lady. 

PRINCESS	My lord. Even though our last meeting was kind of a failure…Would you kindly accept my invitation for an afternoon of horse riding and to share a glass of the Aspanian wine?  

PRINCE	You know Princess, I don’t usually drink. What about tea…with a drop of milk and a pinch of cinnamon?

PRINCESS	…and a cup of tea from far Olleria with a drop of milk and a pinch of cinnamon?

PRINCE	Just my cup of tea.

PRINCESS	What a coincidence, huh? I think my father would love to meet you before the ride. 

PRINCE	My lady, these horses..… 

PRINCESS	Ellen. When we were kids you called me Ellen. And yes, they’re Bersians.

AMELIA	Your Highness.

GUARD by GATE	Wait, it’s the Princess…

PRINCE	Ellen, wait!

PRINCESS	Come on! I thought your horse was faster, my lord. 

PRINCE	Don’t want to embarrass you, my lady.

PRINCESS	You wish.

PRINCE	You know, you don’t need to hide it from me.

PRINCESS	Habit… 

PRINCE	It’s as I remembered. The Rune of Time.

PRINCESS	Yeah. The First Runic Writing.  

PRINCE	...Right. From Timräel Island

PRINCESS	Tirnäel, it’s Tirnäel. 

PRINCE	It didn’t even take that long and you’re correcting me like when we were kids. You remember? 

PRINCESS	No! No! …Are you crazy?…It’s going to take ages to comb it out! You should have stayed at home!....with your tea set. Well, one more time.

PRINCE	Ellen...

PRINCE	Ellen. Wait.

PRINCESS	Come on!

PRINCESS	You wish.

PRINCE	It’s as I remembered it. It’s the Rune of…

PRINCESS	….of Time. It comes from the First Runic Writing.

PRINCE	Do you remember? …..You! Ouch!

PRINCESS	  I am sorry, John…let me see. What is it? 

PRINCE	Nothing.

PRINCESS	You can tell me.

PRINCE	The only person who took care of me like this, was my mother

PRINCESS	Ah, she doesn't do it anymore?

PRINCE	No, she died almost eight years ago. But I thought that you knew? 

PRINCESS	...I’m sorry. 

PRINCE	It’s ok. It’s been a long time. 

PRINCE	I’ve been meaning to tell you something...Something I’ve never told another living soul. 

PRINCESS	Father, would you mind if I sit next to Prince John?

KING	Of course.  Why are you wearing the red dress again? You don’t have anything else to wear? 

PRINCESS	So that I can match up with Prince John.

PRINCESS	You didn’t fall in love with me?

PRINCESS	Another alchemy lesson? 

AMELIA	Preparation for the final exam. Let’s go shoot? 

PRINCESS	Not now,... let’s do it tomorrow. 

ARCHIBALD	Ah, I wish you a happy birthday, my dear. 

PRINCESS	I know, I know. It’s my birthday. I am curious how old you are. So old that there’s no point celebrating anymore, right? 

ARCHIBALD	How can I help you, Ellen? 

PRINCESS	You really haven’t thought it through properly, have you? It was not a good idea to invite a prince to kiss me One kiss is not love! I can personally guarantee that it won’t work. How could I know? Because today keeps coming back over and over again. You want me to prove it to you? Think of a number, any number.

ARCHIBALD	You don’t need to prove anything. I expected something like this would happen. Do you remember the spell I cast that protects you? 

PRINCESS	Of course, I remember

ARCHIBALD	Recite it for me. 

ARCHIBALD	“I invoke the spirits of the First Runic Writing to protect your soul…”…may time be your servant, not your master.”

ARCHIBALD	I didn’t mean for this to happen, but as the years went on, I’ve thought about it more and more. That you would come to me, reliving the same day. Let me see your hand… How many times?  

PRINCESS	I am not sure, I've already had about thirty birthdays.

ARCHIBALD	We have no time to waste. You must find your true love or kill the source of the curse – Murien. It should have been taken care of by the Witch Hunters. Yesterday morning, she took over the old castle on the border. Have you seen the crows?  “When above our lands the flocking crows fly...”

PRINCESS	Oh, come on...

ARCHIBALD	See for yourself…but ...be careful. 

GUARD MARTIN	We’ve already read it four times.. Shouldn’t we give it back to Archibald?  

GUARD HARRY	Just the crystal, eh?

GUARD MARTIN	“The crystal fell apart and the wicked witch lost all her power. A happy ending.

PRINCESS	One, two, three, four…

GUARD HARRY	Is it ok?

GUARD MARTIN	No, there is a scratch, look.

AMELIA	Won’t the guards be looking for you?

PRINCESS	Sure they will.

GUARD HARRY	Princess?

GUARD MARTIN	Where is she? Well, why don’t you learn how to read?

GUARD HARRY	You and your book! We are lost! Princess?!  Learn how to read yourself! Princess?

GUARD MARTIN	Scurry along, scurry along! Princess?

WOODCUTTER	Princess Ellen?

WITCH HUNTER	Your majesty, what are you doing here?

PRINCESS	I just came to see how...

WITCH HUNTER	This is no place for children. We are the professional Witch Hunters. It’s our job.

PRINCESS	Let’s see how great you are. 

WITCH HUNTER	Revelio porta.

ARCHIBALD	It should have been taken care of by the Witch...

BOTH	…the Witch Hunters... 

PRINCESS	They didn’t even manage to get through the main gate. 

ARCHIBALD	Ellen, what exactly...will happen tonight? 

PRINCESS	At the moment of sunset… the Black Storm. 

ARCHIBALD	The Black Storm? Murien can invoke the Black Storm? 

PRINCESS	And what did Murien want from me back then?

ARCHIBALD	Your soul. Her price to protect the kingdom from the Black Storm. Now it seems the Storm was her doing.

PRINCESS	My soul? Why would she just not take it?

ARCHIBALD	Magic has its rules, Ellen. The soul of those with Royal blood could give her eternal life only when given voluntarily. And exactly seven days after birth. Now I see. She planned it all along. Murien would save the kingdom, but only if your father granted her wish. Be it anything. Standing at the tallest tower, watching the storm coming, King Robert could not but agree. The Black Storm was gone, and so was Murien. Only she came back a year after to ask for your soul. He obviously refused and the rest you know. Murien had cursed you that day…but I put a Firstrune on your hand and invoked a spell to protect you. That’s why you keep reliving the same day. The Firstrune of Time protects you. They didn't even get through the main gate, you say? It must be locked by powerful magic. The Locksmith’s Scroll. 

ARCHIBALD	In fact it’s a legend, but it might actually exist. If it does… it’s somewhere… in the Forbidden Mountains. . You must look for it there, yourself. 

PRINCESS	Me? In the Forbidden Mountains?

ARCHIBALD	Exactly.

PRINCESS	They’re forbidden for a reason.

ARCHIBALD	Does that bother you?

PRINCESS	Why should I be the one to go there?

ARCHIBALD	Once you enter the Forbidden Mountains… According to the legend, you must find the Mouth of Truth carved into the rock,…go through the Whispering Mists to get to the Ear of Secrets...and behold the Eyes of Light. “Let the Mouth speak, so that the Ear would listen. Let the Mouth speak, so that the Light shines unblurred. So the riddle is heard.” Ellen, time has become your servant now. Use it wisely.

PRINCESS	Will you come with me? 

ARCHIBALD	You would never make it in time with me. You must find someone else. 

PRINCESS	So that's why I’m reliving the same day over and over again.

PRINCESS	Now get the horses ready.

AMELIA	And one for the Prince?

PRINCE So you're saying...you’re reliving the same day over again? Am I supposed to believe that? 

PRINCESS	Yes. If I tell you something you have never told another living soul.

GUARD by GATE: Princess, you must not leave the castle! Ring the alarm! Ring the alarm!

PRINCE	The horses can’t get through. I guess we have to go on foot. 

PRINCESS	There, it should be on the other side. The Mouth of Truth.

PRINCE	Great. How do we get across? Fancy a swim? 

AMELIA	The answer is here. But it’s incomplete. 

PRINCE	There’s another one.  What does it say? 

AMELIA	It is the First Runic Writing, the translation could be tricky. “If you know the path, say it to the lake and be guided“.

PRINCESS	But we know the path… 

PRINCE	Okay, say it. 

AMELIA	Not “say”. But “write”. Write it! “If you know the path, write it down. “ “If you know the path”, meaning write down the runic letter for the word “path”.

PRINCE	So what now? 

PRINCESS	Amelia, you’ve become a true alchemist! 

AMELIA	Not yet. According to Archibald, there is still the final exam to pass. And I have no idea what to expect. What was Archibald’s clue?

PRINCESS	How did it go? … “Let the Mouth speak, so that the Ear would listen. Let the Mouth speak, so that the Light shines unblurred. So the riddle is heard.” 

MOUTH	What are you asking for, Ellen? 

PRINCESS	I seek the Locksmith’s Scroll. 

MOUTH	Go  steps through the Mists of Whisper, until you’ll reach another rock pool. There you’ll find the Ear of Secrets. Then you should disclose the truth others want to hear, yet would not ask because of their fear.” 

PRINCESS	90, 91, 92, 93...

VOICE	You are lost, it’s pointless even to try…

AMELIA	Come on, guys. There’s nothing here.

AMELIA	Watch out!

PRINCE	Ellen! 

PRINCESS	John!

PRINCE	Grasp at the root! Grab my hand!

AMELIA	You found it.

PRINCE	“Disclose the truth others want to hear, yet would not ask because of their fear.” 

AMELIA	A hidden truth. So, a secret. Ellen, try telling the ear a secret. 

PRINCESS	I keep reliving the same day over and over again. 

AMELIA	Well, obviously. 

PRINCE	 May I? Hey, it’s a secret, so don’t listen?  

AMELIA	Done? 

PRINCE	No! 

PRINCE	Well, I had hoped that in exchange for my help, the King would offer me Ellen’s hand. 

AMELIA	So?  

PRINCE	So...

AMELIA	So what? 

PRINCE	So, we need help.  

MURIEN	“I doom your daughter to a childhood in fear. On the day the princess marks her coming of age, as the sun finally sets behind the third mountain, the castle will be consumed by darkness.”

AMELIA (SONG)	Ware, beware the falling light, Shelter well from the night. Don’t despair for the curse, you may break On silent wings, night awakes. The horse must run, beyond the shore The shadowed sun, veiled in fear Perhaps the father will break through before The blackened wings, come too near, ever near. Run, so run. Bend the hourglass to your will The sands of time, frozen still. Perhaps you are the one. Perhaps you’re the only one To strike the beast from the sky The horse must run, beyond the shore. The shadowed sun, veiled in fear Perhaps the father will break through before The blackened wings come too near, come too near.

PRINCESS	“Disclose the truth others want to hear, yet would not ask because of their fear.”

ARCHIBALD	“…yet would not ask because of their fear.”

PRINCESS	Any clues?  

ARCHIBALD	No, sorry. I could try sleeping on it until tomorrow but that probably wouldn’t work... By the way, interesting riddle.

PRINCESS	Riddle, riddle…

PRINCESS	, , , , , ,  and... 

PRINCE	What? 

PRINCE	Do you know what to say? 

PRINCESS	That depends on you.  

PRINCE	On us? 

PRINCESS	“Disclose the truth others want to hear, yet they would not ask because of their fear.” You must ask me something you want to know…be honest! Come on, the whole kingdom is at stake, you are not scared of me, are you? Come, John of Calderon.

AMELIA	I know! Why did you tell my parents I’d been secretly attending Archibald’s alchemy lessons?

PRINCESS	You knew? 

AMELIA	Yeah, I’ve known the whole time.

PRINCESS	I was jealous.  

EAR: Correct! 

PRINCESS	Amelia, back when I was learning how to curtsy and walk in high heels

PRINCESS	My best friend was allowed the freedom to visit Archibald and learn alchemy

PRINCESS	The only fun thing I managed to wheedle out was learning the bow and arrow. That’s the only thing.

PRINCESS	I’m sorry. John?

AMELIA	Go ahead.

PRINCESS	Come on…

PRINCE	Why did you stop inviting me to your birthday parties when you turned twelve?

AMELIA	No? You did that?

PRINCESS	Because I thought you weren’t interested. That wasn’t the question you were afraid to ask, was it? 

PRINCESS	You mean this pre-alchemist has more courage than the future king? Is your kingdom full of such heroes? Your father the King must be a real hero!

PRINCE	Enough. I won't listen to this talk. It takes courage to come to a cursed kingdom on the day of its doom just to ask…

PRINCESS	Ask what?

PRINCE	Doesn’t matter!

PRINCESS	To ask what?! Oh, you coward!

PRINCE	You cursed little brat!  

PRINCESS	To ask what?! 

PRINCE	I came here to ask if you loved me.

AMELIA	Oh, how sweet. 

PRINCESS	No…

AMELIA	You do? 

PRINCESS	I do? Then, I don’t know. 

EAR	Correct! Ellen, once the shadow falls on the opposite bank, swim towards the Eyes of Light. There you shall find the Scroll. The Scroll opening every door. 

AMELIA	You didn’t tell me you didn’t know...

AMELIA	Hurry! 

PRINCE	Catch it!

PRINCE	Ellen! 

PRINCESS	Oh look, our brilliant Witch Hunters. 

PRINCESS	Nua porta apertum, nua magicae aperta. Nullum secretum occultari. Nua non est ira egressus es validum.

PRINCESS	Well, I came in handy. 

MURIEN	The Locksmith’s Scroll. Very inventive, Ellen. How can I help you? 

PRINCESS	How can you help me? Remove the spell and let peace return to our kingdom.

MURIEN	Don’t tell me you went through all the trouble to get the Locksmith’s Scroll just to tell me this. The curse is irreversible. 

PRINCESS	Only if you were to stay alive.

MURIEN	For a little while I thought you were smarter than your father. Humanis est anima. 

PRINCESS	I’m still standing. Maybe you’ve messed it up? 

MURIEN	Et in tempore erit humana... Et erunt uque ad tempus... Rapido Fossilizatio. 

PRINCESS	Bring it on. ?

PRINCESS	Like I said, she stands with her back to us. We have to shoot before she turns. John, you will have time to hide behind the column on your left, get closer to her. Beware of the blue light! 

GUARD MARTIN	“Took aim at her crystal, and fired…” 

PRINCESS	Amelia, don’t you have any magic tricks? ?

AMELIA	I am not a witch. I’m an alchemist. We master magical objects. Not charms. 

AMELIA	It belongs to Archibald. 

PRINCESS	Now!!!

GUARD MARTIN	“….he took aim at her crystal. And fired.” 

PRINCESS	Don’t wait with the daggers, we must attack her as soon as she’s close enough. 

PRINCESS	You crawl! Understand?   CRAWL! 

GUARD MARTIN	“And so the hunter stood face to face with the witch. He drew his longbow, Took aim at her crystal. And fired.” “The exact moment the arrowhead shattered the crystal, which is the true source of power for all witches, a scream rose from the throat of the witch. Good morning, Princess…We will return the book. 

PRINCESS	The rose! We have to destroy the rose! 

GUARD MARTIN	Princess wait!

PRINCESS	I’ll shoot at Murien and you destroy the rose.

PRINCE	Ellen! 

MURIEN	Such a brave boy and yet so foolish - true hero. You really think you can measure your skills against mine? Very well

MURIEN	Why are you doing this, John?  

PRINCE	Promise and love.

MURIEN	She’s just a silly little girl! She doesn’t love you at all! She is not able to love – Her soul is cursed!  

PRINCE	Do you think you had killed all the love in her? No spell could possibly kill all the love in a heart, Murien. 

PRINCE	I’ve learnt about her love years ago… …that’s when I fell in love with her true self. For which I would lay down my life!

MURIEN	Ariete maximo! 

PRINCESS	John...

MURIEN	You can’t beat me, Princess…you’re just a little girl.

PRINCESS	Whatever you may think, Murien, I’ll come back again. I’ll keep coming back until you fail.

MURIEN	You’ll be back, will you? Eius magicae, magicae meum. 

ARCHIBALD	Spirits of the First Runic writing protect…. your soul may time be your servant, not your master..” 

MURIEN	The Rune of Time. What do you think? If I take it from you, will you wake up again? Et tutela spell evanescet, (repeats) et tutela spell evanescet, (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet! , (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet!, (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet!, (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet!, (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet!, (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet!, (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet!, (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet!, (crescendo) ?et tutela spell evanescet!

GUARD MARTIN	Giddy up. Let’s go. Come on, we’re almost there. Come on. 

GUARD HARRY	I am exhausted.

GUARD MARTIN	Come on!. Scurry, scurry!

GUARD HARRY	I hate scurrying!

GUARD MARTIN	If you weren’t stealing books from the library, we wouldn’t have to scurry. Smarten up! 

PRINCESS	One last time.

GUARD MARTIN	“He drew back his longbow, took aim at her crystal. And fired.” Good morning, Princess. 

PRINCESS	Good morning, Martin. 

GUARD MARTIN	And a happy birthday to you! 

PRINCESS	Thank you.

GUARD HARRY	Happy birthday, your highness!

PRINCESS	Thank you, Harry.

GUARD HARRY	You know my name? 

PRINCESS	Yeah

GUARD MARTIN	Are we going somewhere? 

PRINCESS	To the market. Come with me.

LADY AT THE MARKET	 Happy birthday, Your Highness!

PRINCESS	Thank you, Anet. How are little Anna and Lucas doing? 

LADY AT THE MARKET	Ah, you remember them. They are both well

PRINCESS	Good...Here Martin,

MARIKA	The Princess! Happy birthday, Your Highness. 

PRINCESS	Thank you, Marika.

STALLHOLDER	Good day your highness. 

PRINCESS	Good morning.

STALLHOLDER	I have a brand new bow here.... yew wood. The string is made from tendon, razor-sharp arrowhead, and fletching from pheasant feather. 

PRINCESS	Say “silence”. 

PRINCESS	Good morning, Martha.

MARTHA	It is s good morning, Your Highness.

NANNY	What are you bringing me? 

PRINCESS	Your shopping list…and a rose.

NANNY	You’ve been to the market? How did you know what I needed to get? 

PRINCE	Don’t face her again, Ellen. Apparently we’ve tried everything but this time you won’t wake up again. You understand?

PRINCESS	You can’t change my mind. We don’t have time to try anything else. But I understand if you are not coming with me. 

PRINCESS	Amelia, I only ask one thing: go to Archibald and tell him what’s going to happen. I’ll tell the people.

AMELIA	It's time.

ARCHIBALD	Take it, if you wish. 

JUGGLER	There is a third question for these three brave young gentlemen. Anybody wants to join us? No? Pity. Prince John?

PRINCE	Step back! Step back!

PRINCESS	 Listen to me, please!  The curse is real. When the sun sets tonight, the Black Storm will come. Flee now while you still can! 

PRINCESS	You should ask me … whether I love you.

PRINCE	What? 

PRINCESS	That is the question that you are afraid to ask me. Come on.

PRINCE	Do you love me? 

PRINCESS	 I don’t know.

PRINCESS	That’s weird. 

PRINCE	What? 

PRINCESS	Normally that answer works. 

PRINCESS	I do?

EAR	Correct! 

AMELIA	Ok, I’ll just be over here...

PRINCESS	Gentlemen! I know you don’t believe me, but please step aside. I know what’s going to happen and I know what’s needed to get inside. The Locksmith’s Scroll. 

WITH HUNTER : You Highness, you don’t... 

PRINCE	Gentlemen, this is not a discussion. 

WITCH HUNTER	Very well. As Your Highness wishes.

PRINCESS	Amelia... could I have a moment with the Prince? 

AMELIA	Most certainly. Gentlemen, why don’t you come with me and check out this interesting rock? Come on.

WITCH HUNTER	Come on!

PRINCESS	I still don’t understand something. The last time we saw each other was a total failure. I made a terrible impression on you. Why is it that you love me?

PRINCE	I love you? 

PRINCESS	Yes, John. You love me.

PRINCE	Yes, I love you. I know what you are like, Ellen. Yes, you can be... you’re sarcastic... and sometimes really obnoxious….But that’s not who you really are. Maybe all you remember is that moment the last time we met. When you told me so confidently how beautiful you are. Using my words. In my heart, I remember something completely different. And even though it was right after my mother left. It was you who kept the little boy inside me from leaving with her. You showed me how to enjoy life when all I could see around me was death. That is how I remember you. I don’t care about what others think. Even if it’s the rest of the kingdom.

PRINCESS	So then why didn’t you come to see me after?

PRINCE	After mother’s death, father shut himself off to the world and I wasn’t able to find the courage to come see you.

PRINCESS	You coward. 

PRINCE	So based on your expression..This is the first time we’ve discussed this in all these todays? 

PRINCESS	Yes it is. 

PRINCE	Come on ... let’s go save the world.

PRINCESS	It might be too late for that.

PRINCESS	Pre-Alchemist, let’s go! And take them with you!

MURIEN	Again? This time you’ve brought more friends...

AMELIA	She remembers too?

PRINCESS	Take me, Murien! I am of the Royal Blood. I give my soul willingly.

PRINCE	You mustn’t! 

MURIEN	I am sure you know the Royal blood must be given the seventh day after birth. It’s over. What a waste. I’ve prepared a little something for you. 

GUARD MARTIN	Harry, hold me! Don’t let go! Don’t let go!

GUARD HARRY	I’ve got you, Martin! I’ve got you! I won’t let go!

WITCH HUNTER	 Oops!

AMELIA	Crystal!

MURIEN	You cannot surprise me anymore! 

PRINCESS	Amelia, No!

ARCHIBALD	Surprise, Murien.  

MURIEN	You have never been my rival.

ARCHIBALD	There’s a first time for everything. 

PRINCE	Ellen!

MURIEN	You think you’re smart. You think you can outwit me, but you know nothing. Your father betrayed me and broke his promise, but it was me who had created the Black Storm so I could take your soul!

PRINCE	Get behind me, Ellen!

PRINCESS	John, no!

JOHN	What have you done? Ellen? 

MURIEN	You sacrificed yourself ...for love?! It won’t help you anyway. Your kingdom is doomed! 

AMELIA	You’re the one that’s doomed. ...Forever!

KING	Where have you been?! What’s happened?  

ARCHIBALD	Murien has fallen.

PRINCESS	Hopefully ’ll tell you more about it tomorrow.

KING	It’s the Black Storm, Archibald... 

PRINCE	I thought we made it. 

PRINCESS	Me too…

PRINCE	For farewell?

ARCHIBALD	Honourable Fellowship of Alchemists, the curse laid upon Aspania has been broken. Here, you’ll find a detailed account of my protective spell invoking the Firstrune of Time. First, it must be said that the end of the story of the Princess Cursed in Time will be presented by the bards as a new beginning. The birth of a new era which brings restoration of long lasting friendships, old values, and… love. Love brings hope of happy tomorrows to many hearts, and that includes mine. Truthfully Yours, Archibald, Chief Alchemist of the Kingdom of Aspania.
