(THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL 2)



ROBBER	Fancy fur coat here! Monster!  They’re devils! Run for your lives!

JONATHAN GREEN	You alright?

CHENG LAN	I’m alright. 

JONATHAN GREEN	Don't worry boy. You are safe now. bCan you see what I see?

CHENG LAN	A tiny Kho Tchai.

JONATHAN GREEN	Anything else? It cannot be.  Am I drunk?

CHENG LAN	Tough guy.

JONATHAN GREEN	I told you to stop tormenting the birds. Stop! Come on you! Out... Out! Fly safe! Don't even think about it!  My darling Miss Dudley, it seems that some kind of conspiracy is going on in Moscow. The real Peter the Great never came back from England.

GUARD	Hold! Why are you here?

MISS DUDLEY	I have an appointment with the prison chief.

JONATHAN GREEN	Using my maps Lord Menshikov has blocked all the roads.  Until the real Russian Tsar returns to his throne …I can only go East.

MISS DUDLEY	I would like to see Mister James Hook! 

JOHNNY LION	Milady, sorry. Mister Hook is temporarily engaged.
 
MISS DUDLEY	What's going on here? 

JOHNNY LION	It's a fight with the prisoners!

MISS DUDLEY	Is that Mister James Hook? I've heard he has a savage temper.

JOHNNY LION	At this very moment the prisoner is beating Mister Hook. 

JAMES HOOK	Well, it wasn't your day. The fear fight is the only way out of here. Anyone who can get to the top is free. Who is next?

ZHONG YI	It seems that Master is not here. We must return to China. Chen Lang will need our help. 

JOHNNY LION	Milady, Mr. Hook is kinder and fairer than you might think.

ZHONG HAO	Zhong Zhe, go and find Cheng Lan! 

JAMES HOOK	This man won his freedom in an honest fight! Let him go! He is free! 

ZHONGZHE	I won't abandon my brothers! We will fight or leave together! 

JAMES HOOK	Alright… I respect your choice. Let them all go!

PRISONERS	Blimey! He really did it! They were fighting like tigers!  Look, he's letting them go! 

JAMES HOOK	Enough for today! break down the ring! Go back to the exercise, gentlemen!  Perfect your bodies!  Remember, a healthy body houses a healthy mind! Mens sana in corpore sano! Exercise! Allow me a moment, Miss… This way!

PRISONERS	There's a pretty lass! You're a nice-looking lady! Such sweet little feet! That's it! Come on down here! Come to me, my beauty! 

CELLMATE	For tomorrow, could you change your routine? My right arm is twice as long as my left. I'll soon be able to touch the river! 

PETER THE FIRST	I’ll never learn. that, Master.

MASTER	If you don't get it, you'll wear your mask forever!

JAMES HOOK	You have an influential father, Miss Dudley. Otherwise I would never let a woman come to this Tower. Please, sit down.I hope you enjoy all the antiques that I've collected over the years.Here this is the helmet of Charlemagne.And this is my pride and joy… Spartacus!And here is the sword of king Arthur! Think about that! King Arthur!Now I could go on with this for hours!What can I do for you milady?

MISS DUDLEY	Mister Hook…I have been informed that one of your prisoners is the real Russian Tsar… Peter the First. He hasn't been able to come home for many years, and I…

JAMES HOOK	We don't have any tsars or kings in our prison.We do have a… Russian prisoner, yes.But he's a spy, Peter Mikhailov. I can show you!But be very careful, Miss Dudley! Don't walk any closer to the prisoners than this line.They can be very aggressive!

MISS DUDLEY	Could you please leave us alone? I need to speak to them.

JAMES HOOK	Just scream if you need help.

CELLMATE	Please! Let me touch you! Please… Please, just one touch! Bring your beautiful little ear over here and I'll tell you my secret! It will be our secret!

MISS DUDLEY	You are too old to be King.

CELLMATE	Please…

MISS DUDLEY	And you don't look like a Russian. So it must be you. Are you the Russian tsar? 

PETER THE FIRST	Of course, I am. Don’t you see that?

MISS DUDLEY	My husband’s life depends on you, getting your throne back. He is supposedly in Russia heading East with some Chinese boy…

PETER THE FIRST	Have you received a new letter?

MISS DUDLEY	Here it is… “My assistant is very young and childlike…but he has great strength, courage and unprecedented skills.I would have taken him for a girl at first glance,if I hadn't seen Chen Lang with my own eyes dealing with a whole pack of robbers in the woods.

MASTER	Cheng Lan is my daughter.

MISS DUDLEY	Daughter? Cheng Lan is a girl? Jonathan is traveling with a girl? I’d never have come here if I’d known. He is traveling with a girl!  Oh my God!

PETER THE FIRST	Wait! Wait!	 It says that he thinks it's a boy.Maybe nothing happened yet.

MISS DUDLEY	Yet? Nothing happened? 

MASTER	Can you help us?  Just make sure the gate is open. 

MISS DUDLEY	Why would I believe you?

MASTER	My daughter will lead him to China! 

PETER THE FIRST	Do you really wanna see your husband alive again?

MISS DUDLEY	Of course, I do!

PETER THE FIRST	It seems that the old man has already got his freedom ... 

MISS DUDLEY	Good heavens! What happened to him? Is he dead? The soul of one of your prisoners has escaped!

JAMES HOOK	That's impossible!  He is dead indeed! How peculiar! Well. At least he died happy.

MISS DUDLEY	Why do you think so? 

JAMES HOOK	As far as I know he hasn't seen a woman in thirty years. All right, take him out! One mouth less to feed.

MASTER	The gate!

PRISON GUARD	John, the old man died, let’s go get him out of here. 

JAMES HOOK	Now, I have to tell you, we do have some impostors in here. We have one man who believes that he is Christopher Columbus.  And another one who thinks he is Don Quixote! Oh, think about that!

PRISON GUARD#1	Stay back!

PRISON GUARD#2	So now you won’t tell us where the buried treasures are!

PRISON GUARD#1	This man was like a legend!

PRISON GUARD#2	He's been here all his life in the Tower. 

PRISON GUARD#1	Hey old man! Where are the treasures?

PRISON GUARD#2	Well, let's get him out of here! 

PRISON GUARD#1	Oh no!

PRISON GUARD#2	Oh shit!

PETER THE FIRST	Your hand, Master!

PRISON GUARD#3	Don't move, or I'll shoot!

JAMES HOOK	There's something happening! Raise the ladder!

JOHNNY LION	Take my hand, milady. 

PRISON GUARD	Don’t move!

PETER THE FIRST	Come on! The Dragon Fist!

MASTER	Sorry…go!

JOHNNY LION	Come down!

MISS DUDLEY	Please, don't let go of me! 

JAMES HOOK	In 500 years no one has ever escaped…

PETER THE FIRST	You wanna jump? 

JAMES HOOK	Come on, go back to your cells! Do they think I'm joking?

PRISON GUARD	Stop! Or I'll shoot! 

JOHNNY LION	It’s fine, come down! I said, come down!

JAMES HOOK	Don’t shoot! I'll deal with them…

PETER THE FIRST	You are free, my friends.

JAMES HOOK	Come on, get down!

PETER THE FIRST	Master! I’m in trouble!

JAMES HOOK	Oh, you little snake…

JOHNNY LION	You need to leave now!

MISS DUDLEY	I’m so afraid!

PETER THE FIRST	What are you doing? 

MASTER	I want to find something!  

PETER THE FIRST	We don't have time!

MISS DUDLEY	That's enough protection, you are too rough. That's enough!

JAMES HOOK	Go back!

PETER THE FIRST	What are you looking for? 

MASTER	A seal!

PETER THE FIRST	This one?

MASTER	Like this!




JOHNNY LION	Don't move! 

PETER THE FIRST	Look up there! It's been awhile since I had a sword in my hand! Hurry up, Master!

MISS DUDLEY	Stop!  Stop it!



GUARD	You can't stop here! 

MISS DUDLEY	I said stop here! 

GUARD	You can’t stop here!

MISS DUDLEY	Now stay here!

MASTER	I’ve found it!

PETER THE FIRST	Come on! Push harder! Damn it! It’s stuck!

MASTER	Give this to Chen Lang...

PETER THE FIRST	How will I find her?

MASTER	The Seal is magic. If you have it, it can help you!

PETER THE FIRST	I swear to find her!

MASTER	Get out of here!
