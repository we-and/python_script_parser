??	Pass!

??	I never raise my voice.

??	Well, I do sometimes.

??	Go on! Go on!

??	Right, boys, we got off to a good start.

??	We have to keep it up.

??	As soon as the goalkeeper sends it back, really quick from the wing...

??	The coach speaks very quietly, you need good ears to follow him.

??	He began by placing his trust in the team and stirring up enthusiasm.

??	He was brilliant at bringing back the fans.

??	When you're pressing, cut out the middle.

??	If he prefers to play it forward, don't force it, just find the right solution.

??	The players know straight away if you are competent or not.

??	It's our game, it's up to us.

??	If we play the way we know how, we'll have no problems.

??	Get back.

??	Every time we press, they lose the ball.

??	When you have it, go! Just go!

??	If the players are on your side, you can ask anything of them and they'll comply.

??	Let's try and anticipate their moves when they start attacking. Okay?

??	From day one we set a goal to tempt back and entertain Italian fans who had lost interest.

??	ROME OLYMPIC STADIUM

??	In a few days UEFA EURO  will kick off.

??	Roberto Mancini's team will play in this stadium the three qualifying rounds. While we wait for kick-off, we will start a four-stage journey to tell you how the Italian team got this far.

??	For the first time, Coverciano, the home of the Italian team, has opened its doors to TV cameras.

??	One against one, you don't stop.

??	For ten months we observed the players during their retreat.

??	We saw them undertake a long journey of training, matches, disappointments and injuries.

??	For ten months we observed, day by day, the surge of the team spirit of players who feel ready to face any challenge.

??	We are about to tell you the story of an Italian Dream.

??	What is football? It's a boy with a football.

??	What is the magic of football?

??	That boy's talent.

??	Coverciano is a splendid place, where you can sense the history of Italian football, because it has all passed through here.

??	The creation of the teams that have achieved success, or those with more negative experiences.

??	COVERCIANO AUGUST TH, 

??	Everything starts out at Coverciano.

??	You get the impression you are in the temple of football.

??	The Italian team is something that's missing.

??	Euro  was postponed...

??	We felt the need to see each other again, and train.

??	Being all together again is like having a big family reunion.

??	It was a difficult time for everyone, for us, and the whole world.

??	We are a great team, we are slowly fighting back.

??	I reckon it's these players that make up the national team.

??	A close, coherent group, who are very fond of each other.

??	And you can see that  from the results.

??	It was the players who believed in this project that we put to them when we arrived here. To try and...

??	To change our mentality.

??	These two matches won't be easy, not at this tricky moment, when you have only just started training again. You'll have physical problems, but the important thing is to get back to being a great team.

??	In our experience, great teams usually have three basic characteristics.

??	There is a common goal that is more important than the individual's goal.

??	The second is to have complementary skills.

??	Having separate skills is definitely very important, and you have those. The third thing is a great sense of responsibility.

??	I expect Lele to do something for me and Lele expects me to do something for him.

??	If we need to punch someone, we punch them in the belly, not their back.

??	Further forward, further forward!

??	Okay. If they move the ball like that we have to bring Locatelli out  and that'll make two.

??	So, a formation. Then..

??	I found lots of players with big personalities, despite everyone thinking, two years ago, that...we would have a struggle to put eleven men on the field.

??	And there are several of them, not just one.

??	Jorginho has character, Barella has character...

??	It's obvious you choose

??	Chiellini and Bonucci because they're more experienced.

??	There are  of us.

??	Yes, if you look...

??	We're here waiting.

??	Give us a hand in the meantime.

??	Yes.

??	I take the confrontation with the forward personally, because I believe my role is a case of "mors tua vita mea".

??	Words help your teammate, we play as a team, as we said before.

??	Boys, let's concentrate on  points.

??	We must go out there nasty and win!

??	I'm shy, I like a quiet life.

??	But my personality completely changes on the field.

??	I become a totally different person.

??	More mean. Your opponents need to feel your presence.

??	I have rather a strong personality.

??	If I have something to say in the changing rooms, I say it.

??	I make myself heard.

??	This is something...

??	Sometimes we move in a pair and others follow.

??	It's better not to go then, or go when we're organized.

??	I'm not the best player technically but I make up for that with my head, determination, strength, humility and hard work.

??	It's obvious that having someone on the field...

??	I mean, you know you can talk to these players who have big personalities, who know what to do and it makes it easier for you to keep contact with the team during the match.

??	Ciro! Over here!

??	Mancini is really good,  he was a brilliant player.

??	That's where he gets his experience in creating human relationships, because as well as being a coach, he can give you important advice on what to do on the field.

??	And that's a big help to everyone.

??	And I have to admit we're seeing results.

??	From the back, a cross! And the

??	Italian team scores an equalizer!

??	Acerbi kicks and Italy is in the lead!

??	Tackle from the left, Bernardeschi!

??	Immobile heads the ball!?

?	He scores after two years!

??	Insigne! What a masterpiece!

??	What a masterpiece!

??	Spinazzola at the back, passes the ball to Sensi!

??	Fantastic header!
??	The youngest on the field!

??	Pass to Jorginho, right on the edge.

??	Jorginho gives it a try and finally scores a goal! Zaniolo...

??	The results speak for themselves, because we won every match in the round.

??	That means that in every match, you went one better, you didn't put a foot wrong and you're improving all the time.

??	And it's thanks to everyone, the players, the staff, the coach, Mancini, who has really put his mark on this team, where everyone feels important and at the heart of something.

??	I agreed to coach them as my whole life has been a challenge and I was happy to take on a difficult task.

??	For the skills I had as a footballer, never being lucky enough to win anything with the national teams I played with, which were really good...

??	It was sheer bad luck we failed to win the World and European cups.

??	I felt a need to try and get even.

??	Roberto Mancini, known as Mancio, is a winner.

??	Go on, Ciccio, go on!

??	He was one of Italy's greatest forwards who became a successful coach both in Italy and abroad.

??	Lorenzo! Lorenzo!

??	Three years ago he took over a team that had reached rock bottom.

??	The elimination from the  World Cup.

??	Come over here!

??	When you get the chance, go.

??	When you can attack, do so!

??	He brought it back to life and won all ten matches in the qualifying round for Euro .

??	He is a calm and relaxed leader.

??	He doesn't have to prove anything. He has the confidence of a great player.

??	When you have a big personality, the players respect you.

??	You don't have to do anything.

??	The players believe you, and do what you say and believe what you say.

??	There's this great balance between discipline and freedom.

??	There are rules to be respected but you trust your players.

??	I was fortunate enough to play top level football for  years, and this enables me to pass on my skills to the players, the skills I acquired in  years as a player and almost  as a coach.

??	Our idea of football is what we have seen since the first day

??	Roberto arrived.

??	The mentality of proactive football that puts up with nothing and tries to take charge of the field and the game.

??	Until now Mancini's offensive and tactical play has been a success.

??	But the question is... is his Italian team up to the great challenge of the Euro  cup?

??	After Turkey in the qualifying round, we will play Switzerland and Wales.

??	If we get through, we will play the big teams.

??	Mbappé's France, Neuer's Germany

??	Busquets's Spain,

??	Romelu Lukaku's Belgium,

??	Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal and Harry Kane's England.

??	Mancini knows it won't be easy, but he's not afraid.

??	More than technical and tactical methods, he is convinced he has taught the team the rules of success.

??	This is his rule number one.

??	The rules for winning...


??	There's only one really, to score goals and not let any in.

??	But it is also essential to build up team spirit, everyone has his own job.

??	And I think that's why things have gone so well so far, because the boys have built extraordinary team spirit.

??	They have a lot of respect for each other and for the team.

??	They all try to do their jobs on and off the field.

??	What exactly is team spirit? Mancini must have thought that the best way to get the concept across was through example.

??	So he chose his lifelong friends to work alongside him.

??	Attilio Lombardo, Fausto Salsano,

??	Alberico Evani and Gianluca Vialli.

??	If you have a group of friends who have lived through and shared a number of incredible sporting successes together, and then you find them all working with the Italian team, the advantages are boundless.

??	Everyone knows what to do and what Roberto Mancini wants.

??	Mancini with his boys, his "brothers" in the Italian team...

??	But if we look closer, we see they have always been close.

??	We're talking about the Sampdoria team, the winning team that the whole of Italy was in love with.

??	Salsano worked with Mancini at Inter, Manchester, at Galatasaray and on the Italian team.

??	Lombardo, Nuciari and Evani...

??	Chicco Evani was already there, and it was a surprise to find the whole group, with Gianluca Vialli.

??	When you put a man like

??	Gianluca Vialli on the bench... the Italian players say:

??	"This is Gianluca Vialli!"

??	Gianluca Vialli was a giant of Italian football, he practically won everything.

??	Vialli and I... Luca and I.

??	Can I say I'm really happy to have found him again on the Italian team?

??	Roberto and I met here in Coverciano when we were  years old.

??	He played for Bologna's youth team and already had a reputation.

??	I played for Cremonese, and we were in Serie C and I had already heard about Mancini, who was a very talented player.

??	MANCINI JOINS THE ITALIAN TEAM!

??	He was a modern player, a top goal-scorer.

??	He had very strong legs and he was super fast.

??	He played centre forward like me. I remember we met and ate together at one of those tables for eight and he knew he would be going to play for Sampdoria, so... we talked about Samp and his future.

??	I lived through my best moments in football with him.

??	Firstly, because we were young.

??	Secondly, because we were able to take a team to the top that had never succeeded before.

??	We also had amazing times together off the field.

??	So we have something more than a friendship.

??	We're practically brothers.

??	And there's the kiss!

??	Mancini kisses the cup.

??	And this is the striker, Gianluca

??	Vialli, who left his mark yet again.

??	We became friends the moment

??	I went to play for Sampdoria.

??	We shared the same philosophy of life, we were the same age, we had the same dreams.

??	These things bring you closer to someone in the same job.

??	We had nine years... nine of the happiest years of our youth together.

??	Roberto was a very entertaining player.

??	A player with a lot of class, a lot of style...

??	So he was elegant and nice to watch.

??	And we were very interchangeable.

??	In nearly all my goals you can see Roberto pass the ball to me.

??	And in many of his goals,

??	I pass the ball to Roberto.

??	Ball to the centre for Mancini, the ball... Goalpost! Unbelievable!

??	And then Vialli scores!

??	Extraordinary action from Sampdoria.

??	Luca was always more mature than I was, more mature than the others, despite being the same age.

  ??	    He always set a good example on the pitch, because he always trained very hard.

??	He's very pragmatic, so he was always very important for us.

??	Pagliuca, long ball to Mancini.

??	Mancini dodges Pisa's defence, including Simoni, and passes the ball to Vialli.

??	Brotherly friendship.

??	It was only fair that Vialli scored the goal.

??	Once, in Genoa, during training, we started to argue. And...

??	Over something minor.

??	He called me Mancini in training and I was offended and didn't talk to him for a few days.

??	That's not what happened.

??	Something happened during training and he used my surname.

??	"Hey, Vialli!", something like that.

??	

??	"If you don't shut your mouth,

??	I'll punch you in the face."

??	I said something like that, and he got angry, quite rightly so.

??	We got the call-up for the Italian team after...

??	After a couple of days, and we still weren't talking.

??	But as our Italian Under  team was an extraordinary group...

??	In short, we made friends again during the call-up.

??	It's been many years since Vialli was scoring goals.

??	He's now playing another match, the most important one, against his illness.

??	I know after what happened to me, there are many people who look at me, see I'm well and think they can get better too.

??	Perhaps because I was a player and a man who was both strong but fragile. Vulnerable too.

??	So I think some people can see themselves in me.

??	I'm here with all my faults, my fears... lots of them, but with the desire to do something important.

??	I am not fighting with cancer because...

??	I don't think I can beat it.

??	It is a much stronger opponent than I am.

??	The way I see it, cancer is an unwanted travelling companion, but I can't do anything about it, it got on the train with me and I have to carry on, travelling, head down, never giving up, hoping that one day this unwanted guest will tire of me and leave... And leave me to live peacefully for many years to come, because there's so much I still want to do.

??	Vialli and Mancini, the goal scoring-twins.

??	According to Mancini, among the players he selected, there are two  that remind him of that amazing pair.

??	I hope Belotti and Ciro can do what we did.

??	I hope so, mainly from a goal point of view. They know each other well even if they don't play for the same team like we did, but they get on fine, so it will be up to me to let them play together sometimes.

??	It's not been easy so far.

??	We're always together, where one of us goes, the other follows.

??	Like a dog and its master, I'm the master and he's the dog.

??	As soon as I arrived here, I felt a little uneasy.

??	Then I was lucky enough to meet Ciro Immobile.

??	I had played with him at Torino, he'd been in the Italian team some time.

??	The fact that he was here really helped because Ciro and I have an important and good relationship, and not just in a sports capacity.

??	We have been friends for a long time and I feel really proud  when he scores a goal.

??	We only have to glance at each other to communicate, we don't need words.

??	As we play the same kind of game, from the bench it is easier to see what you are doing well and what mistakes you are making.

??	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

??	First, second, third.

??	Wasn't it --?

??	No, you ...

??	No, he did .
??	I'm not .

??	Okay.

??	That's mean, though!

??	You run, slip and...

??	Well done him!

??	I'll jump. I'll do this, Ale.

??	Watch, I'll do this.

??	I'll do this and jump.

??	Not me.

??	But both methods are good.

??	Both are good.

??	I'm not stopping.

??	I dragged my foot.

??	He never stopped the action.

??	So if I score a goal and you score a goal, you've lost?

??	I've lost anyway, but I want to lose with pride, in glory.

??	If I'd missed... No, Ale!

??	Were you expecting a chip shot?

??	Ale, save one, then we can go and have a shower.

??	Shall we go anyway?

??	No, we train to the bitter end.

??	Our journey alongside Mancini's boys began in September , the staff and players were in Coverciano after everything stopped for Covid.

??	In front of them the Nations League matches against Bosnia and Holland.

??	Important matches, not only for this tournament, but for Italy's position in the list of top European clubs.

??	The so-called rankings.

??	Our position in the rankings will affect the draw for the  World Cup qualifiers.

??	Being in Pot  means not running the risk of having to play one of the greats of European football.

??	That's what happened in the World Cup qualifiers in .

??	I had never seen Italy eliminated from the World Cup in my whole life.

??	Having Italy in the World Cup means having a wonderful summer because of the excitement of the evening matches.

??	And the streets are empty when Italy are playing, as everyone's home watching the game.

??	So it was the first disappointment in  years.

??	In these last ten seconds,

??	Italy seeks a sporting miracle.

??	Florenzi is about to take the corner kick.

??	ITALY SWEDEN

??	November th, 

??	The whole team is in Sweden's penalty area, even Buffon.

??	Florenzi kicks the ball.

??	Bernardeschi gets ready to head it, deflection!

??	Chiellini is offside.

??	It's over.

??	Italy is out of the World Cup.

??	It has only happened once before.

??	It is a defeat for the whole of Italian football.

??	For the important role football has always played in our country, it was very complicated, because for the first time in  years Italy had failed to qualify for the World Cup.

??	We therefore lost a cultural event for the Italian people.

??	We failed at something that... could have been very important, on a social level too.

??	And therefore...

??	Is an apology due to the Italian people?

??	Apologise for the result? Absolutely.

??	I'm really sorry.

??	Really sorry because tonight, for the umpteenth time,

??	I've realised what it means to coach the Italian team.

??	It was the most difficult moment in my experience with Italian teams, and I think... in the last  years of Italian football.

??	Italy had qualified every time over the years, that we took it for granted we'd be taking part.

??	I finished the game with Sweden with great sadness and very negative thoughts.

??	After the match, I no longer wanted to play.

??	The disappointment was so great it was difficult to cope with.

??	We were certainly not a national team that was prepared to face, in my opinion, a match of that kind.

??	It wasn't the right setting, we weren't all involved in the same way and it wasn't a relaxed setting.

??	It was lacking in enthusiasm, and that weighed heavily.

??	And it weighed heavily on the game.

??	The evening of November th was actually the climax of an ordeal that had begun on September nd.

??	We went to Madrid to play Spain in the key match in the round.

??	We played it with arrogance and self-importance according to the coach

??	Gian Piero Ventura, and we were wiped out.

??	Isco takes the kick...

??	Spain are in the lead.

??	After the match against Spain, in which Italy was totally wiped out by its opponents, the relationship between the players and Ventura deteriorated.

??	Because they felt they had been cast adrift against this clearly superior opponent from a technical point of view.

??	Ball to Sergio Ramos, cross by Sergio Ramos to Morata.

??	And that makes three.

??	That's where it all started.

??	What happened on November th was the logical, inevitable conclusion of what happened after September nd when we lost against Spain.

??	Everything that came afterwards was one more step to the match on November th.

??	Ventura called it the Apocalypse, whoever would have thought it?

??	But the sporting Apocalypse was looming, and we at Rai, who were following the Italian team, could sense it.

??	This is a scene that needs interpreting, because Daniele De Rossi is being told to warm up.

??	But Belotti goes on instead.

??	De Rossi is angry and we'll try and work out why.

??	I didn't refuse, it needs explaining.

??	The TV cameras were on me for two seconds, after that I took off my jacket and went to warm up and get ready to go on, I didn't refuse to go on the field.

??	But at that moment we were all terrified at the idea of losing, we were hoping to score, we were attacking, we were putting pressure on Sweden and it seemed natural to say,

??	"We need to win and you send a midfielder like me on?"

??	Though I might have gone on and scored two goals, you never know... but it wasn't the first substitution to make, and after that the coach sent in other players.

??	Unfortunately, it ended as it did and it was my last...

??	My last presence on the Italian team.

??	This image of De Rossi shows us the level of the defeat, the team defeat.

??	We knew there was something wrong, there was a lot that was wrong, but at that moment, you realised it was all hopeless.

??	There was no rebellion from anyone on the team, also because I always remember that we players are there to represent a nation, and...

??	We are not there to represent ourselves or a coach.

??	Quite rightly the coach gives the instructions and drives the car, but we are there to show our competence and professional skills for the cause and for our nation and our supporters.

??	It was one of the lowest points in Italian football.

??	The only thing we could do was start a new cycle.

??	One of the sights I'll never forget was Buffon in tears because his career in the national team was at an end with an elimination from the World cup. That really hurt.

??	It is a really horrible memory because...

??	Italy versus Sweden was Gigi's last match.

??	It was hard to forget but we had to if we were to build something new.

??	The disappointment of that summer without families in front of the TV cheering Italy on will take some time to forget. But falls can be good because they force us to find the strength to carry on.

??	This comparison between fall and rise doesn't only happen in football, it happens in everyday life too.

??	In some displeasure you may feel.

??	Only when you're down, do you find that extra strength, the energy to show people what you're made of.

??	At a time like that, to pick yourself up, you need heart, you need love.

??	You have to believe in what you want, in what you really want.

??	They start again from Bosnia, but filled with doubts.

??	The players have to get in shape, Mancini's selected many new faces.

??	We start the press conference with

??	Manuel Locatelli, Francesco Caputo and Alessandro Bastoni, the three players at their first call-up.

??	I like it when players arrive here for the first time.

??	Whether it's Caputo who's , or a young boy.

??	It's like a dream come true.

??	After years of working hard... it's very important for me to be here.

??	Emotions run high and...

??	They don't know how to behave.

??	But I think it's wonderful to join the national team when you're , make your debut and score goals.

??	There's movement at the bottom, Caputo is in position, Ciccio Caputo!

??	Making his debut with the Italian strip, for Italy.

??	Yes, working your way up...

??	It's something that not everyone in this environment does.

??	I can claim to have started out playing on a dirt pitch.

??	I've played in practically every category, apart from C,

??	I played in all the others.

??	What's this barbecue? 

??	 I sometimes give them time off

??	because I think it's only right to help them clear their heads of all the work we have done during the week.

??	So I give them some free time, because I think playing football is the best and most simple thing.

??	You have to feel mentally free too.

??	I received a big welcome at

??	Coverciano, they're an amazing group.

??	I opened up by singing,

??	this ritual of singing.

??	So I broke the ice together with

??	the other new players.

??	I'm tone-deaf, guys, even more

??	so than him. Pretend that...

??	You bastards.

??	Hi, boys, let's start by looking at Bosnia.

??	This is probably the team we will be up against.

??	Dzeko is their brains in attack.

??	They're a team with a very vertical game.

??	And therefore with a few passes they attempt to get in the goal area.

??	This triangle is a dangerous one.

??	They study their opponents and work out the patterns. Beating Bosnia would be good not only for the rankings but also for morale after a difficult season.

??	The important thing is to control the ball.

??	We control the ball if they are close together. Control it with speed... the speed of the ball and the reduction is important, especially for the inside forwards, okay?

??	If we're able to do that, to move the ball easier, it will be simpler.

??	Otherwise we'll find ourselves locked in.

??	So be on the alert, guys, okay?

??	Good evening, we've been without the Italian team for ten long months.

??	Now they're back on the field, it's not the same without spectators but it's a small step towards normality.

??	At the Artemio Franchi Stadium in Florence, for the first day of the Nations League, Italy is playing Bosnia.


??	Now for the Italian anthem.

??	In some way it isn't nice to sing the anthem on your own without... , people singing along with you like we are used to.

??	But then you think, right now the eleven of us are representing a nation.

??	Right now eleven of us have to sing for  million people.

??	We heard this anthem from our balconies during lockdown and it's sung again now in a football stadium, a good sign.

??	Come on, forward, forward!

??	This is what matters!

??	Sunjic, Dzeko! Bosnia is in the lead. Edin Dzeko has scored.

??	Get in position. In position.

??	Italy takes the ball again, ball to Sensi.

??	Deflection and goal!

??	Italy has equalized, deflection from Sunjic.

??	Italy had equalized, but the goal belongs to Stefano Sensi.

??	The final whistle and Italy and Bosnia finish in Italy's debut in Nations League.

??	Roberto Mancini is not totally satisfied with the result.

??	A draw is halfway between the paradise of victory and the hell of defeat.

??	Those are the words of Gianni Mura, a great sports journalist.

??	You okay?

??	Fine.

??	Did you sleep well?

??	No.

??	Did you sleep a bit?

??	Not much.

??	I was rather tired last night.

??	Yes.

??	But I couldn't sleep.

??	My eyes were wide open.

??	That's... that's the fatigue.

??	When we are tired and have had a very tiring day, unfortunately we are unable to sleep.

??	It usually takes my body a while to calm down.

??	At the start of the season

??	I'm never...

??	I'm never very calm.

??	Never.

??	A lot of the mistakes many of you made yesterday were due to not being clear-headed, to tiredness... rhythm, timing.

??	Look... we played a Nations League match.

??	I'd trained for six days.

??	On the outer thigh.

??	Okay.

??	In two days' time, they will be playing Holland, a tough team.

??	On the eve of the match, a ritual unknown to us, is being carried out.

??	The number assigned to each shirt.

??	Give Berna .

??	 for Berna.

??	And  for...

??	They've given Jorginho .

??	He's had .

??	Really?

??	And Berardi...

??	Has . They gave him ?

??	Yes.

??	Look what numbers are left.

??	There are two s.

??	Pellegrini. is missing.

??	Seeing the list isn't defined for tomorrow, some need a number.

??	If those tonight have played more matches, you can't give someone else .

??	Insigne has , but if he doesn't play, we take another number off.

??	You need to work it out because they have to print the jerseys and there's no time.

??	These jerseys are all personalized, with the Italian team badge, with the flag, the date and place.

??	I have worked with them since ,

??	I've seen them all.

??	I still remember something...

??	I saw and heard from the sideline.

??	The opponent had kicked out at Chiellini.

??	It sounded as if someone had kicked a plant.

??	The opponent fell over but Chiellini just carried on.

??	When you are with them when they win and when they lose, you are part of a group.

??	And being part of a group makes you form a relationship with Buffon, or Pirlo, Gattuso, and Camoranesi.

??	The best thing was being with them from Trapattoni in the Euro Cup in

??	Portugal, even if we were eliminated, to Lippi's victory in , it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.

??	Being with them, being a World Champion with them.

??	World Champions, Sandro!

??	Well done, well done, with maturity and concentration...

??	I think it's everyone's dream to play here, to play for Italy.

??	Playing in this jersey is something magical and unique for us all because we represent our country.

??	When you're a kid and you watch Italy playing from home, whether it's in the European Cup or World Cup, it's like a dream.

??	At home we have an area with my father's Italian jerseys.

??	I used to steal them, wear them when

??	I was playing and pretend I was him, because my father was a great footballer and it was fabulous to wear his shirt.

??	My parents are from the Ivory Coast.

??	I was born in Italy, I decided

??	I wanted to play for Italy because when I saw the World Cup,

??	I too wanted to play for the Italian team one day.

??	 I love Brazil, I come from there,

??	I can't say I don't love Brazil and that I don't feel Brazilian, but when I made that decision,

??	I had no doubts about it.

??	Because Italy took me in,

??	Italy gave me the opportunity to fulfil my dreams and at that moment

??	Italy needed my help.

??	Mancini's young and multi-ethnic

??	Italy gets ready to play Holland.

??	We have many memories of Holland, goals taken and goals given.

??	The best was the European Cup semi-finals in , with Francesco Toldo's saves.

??	And to think Toldo wasn't supposed to play in that tournament, but Gigi Buffon had injured himself the day before. Toldo took his place and on June ,  against Holland, he played the game of his life.

??	Ale, we have to play.

??	We have to play.

??	Spinazzola, great action from Insigne, assist to Immobile.

??	Immobile again, Immobile inside the penalty area, cross to Barella.

??	A super goal from Italy!

??	Goal by Barella, after a wonderful pass!

??	 Italy's lead is well-deserved.

??	Ciro passed me a great ball, and let's say I was lucky and smart to find myself there at the time.

??	But I owe...

??	I owe Ciro a bottle of wine.

??	I am proud of my team when they play well.

??	For  years we were considered a team that played in defence.

??	But to go to Holland, one of the homelands of football, and hear it was the first time the Italian team had played there and dominated them, well, I think that's a source of satisfaction both for Italian football and for the players.

??	Controlling the ball, playing in attack, putting one of the young talents of the team in goal, all this is Mancini's idea of football which takes Italy to the top of the Nations League round.

??	First.

??	First in the round.

??	Great!

??	We're first.

??	I like Mancini's team, he has created a group of very young players.

??	He sent an important message to the clubs, by calling-up players who still had to debut with their own teams to play for Italy.

??	It's like saying, "let the youngsters play because they're good."

??	The symbol of Mancini's young team is Nicolò Zaniolo.

??	But in football you always have to take misfortune into account.

??	Zaniolo was injured during the game against Holland.

??	A nasty blow to the knee that jeopardized his presence in the cup.

??	After I injured myself, at half-time,

??	Mancini comforted me by saying,

??	"Don't worry, it's not serious, it's just a sprain."

??	He said it to reassure me, but I think he knew, like everyone else.

??	Everyone knew what I'd done even without the MRI scan results.

??	But he said, "Don't worry, it might only be a sprain.

??	Moise will go on now and score a goal for you."

??	Football is made up of highs and lows. You win an important match but lose one of the players you are relying on most.

??	Mancini knows this and so do his players.

??	We will try and take Italy back where it deserves to be, because Italy is not the Italy that played Sweden, it's the Italy we have seen in recent months and years.

??	I think it's only right to give our best and put Italy back at the top of the world.

??	I've reached a stage in my life where I want to inspire people.

??	I want the supporters to realise we need them now, to start afresh.

??	What do we want?

??	What does this team want?

??	To fight back, to grow and to start winning again.

??	If there's one thing we've learnt during the first stage of the journey towards the European Cup... next episode ..is that Mancini's team works as a group, rather than individuals.

??	We have to get in the top ten.

??	Tomorrow we will talk about other matches and other obstacles.

??	Over the Italian team and the whole country

??	looms the arrival of a new wave of Covid cases.

??	The team will be affected.

??	Roberto Mancini has tested positive to Coronavirus.

??	I hope to see you soon.

??	They say a group's strength is proved in times of difficulty.

??	Mancini tests positive

??	Evani coaches Italy

??	It's as though Roberto were here.

??	We'll find out if that's true.

??	Yes!
