STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the Island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends. Really Useful around the World!

STORYTELLER	Thomas in Kenya!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was taking some holiday makers on a safari – all the way up the valley of the East African Rift.

STORYTELLER	Thomas’s passengers were very excited. They were looking forward to spotting lots of African animals. But there was one little boy who was only interested in seeing one animal...

STORYTELLER	A chimpanzee!

STORYTELLER	Passing through the grassland plains, Thomas saw giraffes...

STORYTELLER	And his passengers saw them too.

STORYTELLER	By the lake, Thomas saw some flamingos.
STORYTELLER	And his passengers saw them too.

STORYTELLER	And they all spotted a hippopotamus!

STORYTELLER	As Thomas passed by the mountains, he was very lucky indeed.

STORYTELLER	Because he saw a rhinoceros!

STORYTELLER	And then he saw two! 

STORYTELLER	Thomas looked out for chimpanzees.

STORYTELLER	And at one point, he thought he heard something.

STORYTELLER	But it wasn’t a chimpanzee.

STORYTELLER	It was just someone who really, really wanted to see one.

STORYTELLER	Thomas was happy to have seen so much wonderful wildlife – but he was sad for the little boy who wanted to see a chimpanzee. 

STORYTELLER	And that’s when he heard something.
STORYTELLER	Thomas wondered who was making that noise...

STORYTELLER	...and then he realised where it was coming from!

STORYTELLER	Those cheeky chimpanzees! The little boy got to see them after all!

STORYTELLER	And so did Thomas! Right up close!
