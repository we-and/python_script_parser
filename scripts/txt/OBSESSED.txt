Elaine	like I don't have a job tomorrow.

Damon	You still have your job.

Damon	Silvia loves you.

Damon	Okay?

Damon	Let's take it from the top.

Damon	Okay, you gotta nail that lift, all right?

Elaine	Okay.

Damon	Ready?

Elaine	Yeah.

Damon	Five, six, seven, eight, tenga.

Music	(upbeat music)

Music	(vocalist singing in Spanish)

Music	Yo, say hello to my little friend

Music	(vocalist rapping in Spanish)

Music	Take that all in the north end

Music	You know I reppin' my city and I do it for my hood

Music	Hear me hitting, making noise like I know they should

Music	Yo, my barrio don't stop, everybody know

Music	Yes, you know

Music	(vocalists singing in Spanish)

Music	(doubtful music)

Silvia	Say good night to Peggy.

Lily	Night Peggy.

Lily	Please, don't go to bed.

Silvia	(Silvia chuckling)

Lily	Night Momma.

Silvia	Night Lily-pad.

Adrian	We need to talk.

Adrian	Why would you say that to Elaine?

Adrian	You embarrassed us both.

Silvia	Oh, I'm sorry.

Adrian	I was working.

Adrian	How many times do I have to tell you this is my work?

Adrian	I study people, women especially.

Silvia	You were filming her!

Silvia	The girls and I won't be staying here tonight.

Adrian	Is that what you think?

Silvia	Adrian, I love that you're so fascinated

Silvia	with studying women,

Silvia	but there is a line as to what's appropriate

Silvia	and you continue to cross it.

Silvia and Adrian	(couple grunting) (dramatic music)

Silvia	Adrian please, please just let me leave.

Silvia	Please just let me leave, please.

Adrian	Subservience, the single most important trait of a woman.

Adrian	(laughing)

Adrian	And to think you had so much potential.

Adrian	You're being anxious and irrational again.

Adrian	It's time to take your medication.

Silvia	I already took it.

Adrian	Being argumentative is a masculine trait

Adrian	brought on by high levels of testosterone.

Adrian	Trust me, Silvia.

Adrian	This is going to level you out.

Silvia	(Silvia sobbing) (portentous music)

Silvia	Stop.

Music	(somber piano music)

Music	(Jeep radio playing)

Elaine	Hey, you're wearing layers!

Damon	I am wearing layers only for you, babe.

Elaine	Thanks for the ride.

Damon	Mm-hmm.

Damon	So was I right?

Damon	Or was I right?

Elaine	You were right.

Elaine	See ya.

Elaine	Love you.

Damon	Love you.

Music	(ominous music)

Elaine	Silvia?

Elaine	Silvia?

Elaine	I'm here.

Girls	(girls chattering in the distance)

Girls	Elaine!

Elaine	Hello!

Elaine	Where's your mom?

Lily	We don't know.

Elaine	She getting changed?

Mackenzie	No, she hasn't come out all morning.

Elaine	How about Adrian, is he home?

Mackenzie	Nope, he left.

Mackenzie	It's their anniversary.

Elaine	Oh.

Lily	He's getting a love gift. (chuckling)

Elaine	(Elaine laughing)

Elaine	Okay, all right, I'm gonna go check on your mom.

Elaine	She would not like this mess.


Mackenzie	MackenzieShe made the mess.

Lily and Elaine	No you I'll be back.

Lily	She, you know she made it.

Lily	She made the mess.

Mackenzie	You made it.

Lily	No you, you made it.

Elaine	Silvia?

Elaine	Silvia?

Elaine	Silvia?

Elaine	The girls are making a mess downstairs.

Elaine	Um, I'll clean it.

Elaine	You feeling okay?

Elaine	Silvia?

Music	(dissonant music)

Girls	Elaine!

Elaine	D-d-d-don't come in here.

911 Operator	911, what's your emergency?

Elaine	Uh please, please send help, please.

Radio	(police chattering over the radio)

Music	(somber music)

Detective Munro	Are you Elaine Davidson?

Elaine	Yes.

Detective Munro	I'm detective Munro.

Detective Munro	Mind going over your statement with me?

Elaine	Um, sure.

Elaine	I, I got here at 7:00 a.m,

Elaine	um, that's when Silvia asked me to babysit.

Elaine	I let myself in.

Detective Munro	Is it normal for no one to answer?

Elaine	Sure, I mean I usually see her at some point, um.

Officer	So she texted you?

Hank	Yeah, uh, around midnight was when I got the message.

Hank	And she asked if the kids and her

Hank	could stay over at my place.

Officer	Is that normal?

Hank	No, I mean, it was kind of weird.

Hank	I mean, we're co-workers.

Hank	And you know then a couple minutes later she texted me again

Hank	saying nevermind, the text was meant for her mom.

Detective Munro	Continue.

Elaine	I went to go check on her.

Elaine	It was strange for the girls to be unattended.

Detective Munro	Did anything look out of place when you walked in, or?

Elaine	No, not really.

Adrian	Where is she?

Adrian	What's going on?

Adrian	What's happening?

Detective Munro	Are you Adrian Cartwright?

Adrian	Yes.

Detective Munro	Mind coming with me.

Elaine	It's okay.

Adrian and Elaine	Of course, yeah. I got them.

Adrian	Thank you.

Detective Munro	Mind telling me where you were this morning?

Adrian	Yeah, I was in a session with a client.

Adrian	I'm a psychiatrist.

Adrian	Today was our anniversary.

Detective Munro	I'm sorry to hear that.

Detective Munro	Follow me.

Detective Munro	Are there security cameras in your home?

Adrian	Nanny-cams.

Detective Munro	In your bedroom?

Adrian	No, that was not necessary.

Detective Munro	Well, I'll need you to turn over anything you have

Detective Munro	from last night.

Detective Munro	Under normal circumstances, we would assume foul play.

Detective Munro	But there was absolutely no sign of struggle

Detective Munro	or forced ingestion.

Adrian	Excuse me?

Detective Munro	Were you aware that your wife was on antidepressants?

Adrian	Yes, she was, she was seeing an associate

Adrian	of mine for treatment.

Detective Munro	All evidence points to suicide.

Adrian	(Adrian sobbing)

Detective Munro	I'm very sorry for your loss.

Officer	Sir, we're going to have to, uh, have you, uh,

Officer	please come down to the station for questioning.

Officer	Sir.

Officer	Not now, take your time.

Music	(dissonant music)

Music	(gloomy symphonic music)

Elaine	(Elaine sniffling)

Damon	You shouldn't have seen that.

Damon	I'm so sorry you had to see that.

Elaine	Yeah.

Damon	How are the girls holding up?

Elaine	They know something's wrong, but they don't know what.

Elaine	Adrian's gonna tell them tonight.

Damon	God.

Damon	I can't imagine.

Elaine	Me neither.

Damon	I know it's hard.

Elaine	I just, I want to be there for them.

Elaine	I don't even know if I'll be able to.

Elaine	I don't, I don't even know if I have a job anymore.

Elaine	And, and I'm barely making rent as it is and I just,

Elaine	I don't know if I'll have a place to live next month.

Damon	Stop, don't think like that.

Damon	We're gonna make it work

Damon	one way or another.

Damon	I love you.

Elaine	I love you too.

Music	(menacing music)

Damon	Okay, so just please just don't worry about it.

Damon	I know it's all on your mind right now

Damon	but you just gotta, you gotta stay focused.

Music	(stereo playing R&B music)

Elaine	Yeah, you're right.

Music	Want you to feel like my place is yours

Music	You ain't gotta rush, we can stay this way for sure

Music	Best part of waking up is seein' you'd feel your touch

Music	So chill right here, chill right here

Music	Ain't gotta go now

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	Girl, you ain't gotta leave, oh

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	You can stay up for a while

Music	You can stay for a while

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	Let me fix your necklace

Music	Let me make you breakfast

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	Sit down

Music	So let me know, let me know, baby

Music	If there's anything you want I can get it for you

Music	I just gotta know if what I feel

Music	If you feel the same way too, whoa

Music	If what I feel is real

Music	Why don't we just kick it

Music	Can't fight the feeling

Music	Yeah

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	Wake up, sit down

Music	We can light a fire, sweet talk in your fire

Music	We can warm it up, tell me all that you desire

Music	I wanna know, babe

Music	And we can turn it up, any kinda way

Music	Turn down, if you stay here with me

Music	Please don't go

Damon	Mm-mm.

Damon	Mm-mm.

Elaine	Hey, Adrian.

Adrian	Hi, Elaine, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

Elaine	No, um, how are you holding up?

Adrain	Not well to be honest.

Adrain	Silvia's mother and I are meeting up

Adrain	to discuss funeral arrangements.

Adrain	Could you come over?

Elaine	Are you sure it's a good idea

Elaine	for the girls to have a babysitter right now.

Adrian	Well, you're a part of the family.

Adrian	The girls already feel abandoned by their mother.

Adrian	If you were to disappear too,

Adrian	I'm sure it would just make it much harder.

Adrian	Though I do understand if you feel uncomfortable.

Elaine	No, no of course not.

Elaine	I'll, I'll be there.

Adrian	She made the mess.

Adrian	I could come collect you.

Elaine	That's okay.

Elaine	Damon will give me a ride.

Adrian	Excellent.

Elaine	Great.

Elaine	Bye.

Damon	Everything okay?

Damon	Girls okay?

Elaine	Yeah, wants me to come over.

Damon	Don't you think it's a bit weird

Damon	Adrian's not with the girls right now?

Elaine	What do you mean?

Damon	I don't know, his wife just died.

Damon	I mean, he should be with his family.

Elaine	I mean, he's only their stepdad.

Elaine	You know I've been with them since they were babies.

Elaine	They need me right now.

Elaine	Do you mind?

Damon	It's a good thing I love you.

Music	(inauspicious music)

Elaine	I'm fine, really just stressed.

Adrian	Well, I'm happy to listen.

Adrian	Please.

Elaine	You really don't have to worry.

Elaine	I mean, I've had a bit of a weird day,

Elaine	but I know that what you're going through

Elaine	is a heck of a lot worse.

Adrian	Honestly, if you can take my mind off Silvia,

Adrian	even for a moment, I'd be very thankful.

Adrian	Please, tell me what's going on.

Elaine	I don't know, I, I guess I'm pretty stressed

Elaine	for this audition.

Elaine	I, I don't really know if I'm ready to dance again.

Adrian	You know it's completely natural for a woman

Adrian	such as yourself to feel insecure

Adrian	after such a traumatic injury.

Adrian	What you need is the proper support.

Adrian	Now a doctor can heal your leg,

Adrian	but really it's your relationship with yourself and others

Adrian	that will heal your mind.

Adrian	How long ago did your injury happen?

Elaine	Um, about this time last year.

Elaine	I was supposed to audition for the same company

Elaine	and I got injured rehearsing.

Adrian	Ah, so you're stuck in a loop.

Elaine	Um, what do you mean?

Adrian	A year ago you were injured

Adrian	right before your chance of success.

Adrian	Your fear that history will repeat itself is self-sabotage.

Adrian	Your subconscious basically wants you to fail.

Elaine	So what do I do to get out of the loop?

Adrian	Well, there are a number of things that we could do.

Adrian	Have you considered a change in career?

Elaine	I, I don't really know if I'm ready

Elaine	to talk about this yet.

Adrian	It's fine, I'm sorry if I crossed the line.

Elaine	No.

Adrian	I'm only here to help.

Elaine	I should get back to the children.

Adrian	Elaine, men and women have inherent purposes.

Adrian	If dance isn't fulfilling you,

Adrian	don't forget to think about what does.

Adrian	The children, for instance, never fail to make you happy.

Elaine	Yeah, you're definitely right about that.

Adrian	I was very close with my babysitter growing up.

Adrian	Don't discount the importance of your role in their lives.

Elaine	Thank you.

Music	(ill-boding music)

Young Adrian	I can play baseball?

Sofia	If you want to.

Young Adrian	Thank you, mommy, thank you.

Young Adrian	No, mommy, no!

Sofia	You need to learn that nothing in life is permanent.

Sofia	It will help you mature.

Hank	Oh hey, uh, hey Dr. Cartwright.

Adrian	Not now.

Hank	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Hank	I just really need some closure.

Hank	I just wanted to ask you about the text, uh, Silvia sent me

Hank	the night before she died.

Adrian	Will you excuse me?

Hank	Yeah, okay.

Hank	The police were asking me and I'm a little confused.

Adrian	Look if you, if you want to come over another day,

Adrian	I'd be happy to put your mind at ease.

Hank	Yeah, okay.

Music	(dramatic instrumental music)

Sofia	You want it, take it.

Adrian	What are you doing?

Elaine	Oh I couldn't figure out how to change the input.

Elaine	It was stuck on DVD all night.

Elaine	(chuckling)

Adrian	What did you watch?

Elaine	A little nostalgic to my childhood.

Adrian	Mm-hmm.

Adrian	I should probably get you home.

Elaine	Yeah.

Music	(unsettling music)

Elaine	Thanks for the ride.

Adrian	Of course.

Adrian	Elaine, I, I was wondering if you had a chance

Adrian	to think about our conversation we had in my office.

Elaine	I did.

Elaine	Um, you were right.

Elaine	I may be physically ready to dance again,

Elaine	but I don't know if I'll ever be mentally ready.

Adrian	If you ever want to talk more about it.

Elaine	I've got Damon.

Elaine	He's a better listener than I give him credit for.

Adrian	Elaine, I'm not one to judge,

Adrian	but sometimes the person we lean on most is actually

Adrian	the person that's standing in the way of our success.

Adrian	Believe it or not,

Adrian	I've actually got a bit of experience in that area,

Adrian	so I'm here if you need me.

Elaine	Okay, I appreciate it.

Adrian	Good night.

Elaine	Night.

Adrian	No, mommy, no!

Sofia	You need to learn that nothing in life is permanent.

Sofia	It will help you mature.

Adrian	I said no!

Sofia	You want it, take it.

Adrian	Ow, my hand!

Carla	Oh my gosh, what's going on?

Carla	Did he burn himself?

Adrian	I want to play baseball. (mumbling)

Sofia	If he wanted it so badly, he would have taken it.

Adrian	The essence of femininity is trifold.

Adrian	To be classified as a TRUE woman,

Adrian	she must be subservient,

Adrian	interested in children, and fearful.

Adrian	To be classified as a TRUE man,

Adrian	he must be in possession of a TRUE woman.

Music	(sinister symphonic music)

Adrian	Hey, morning.

Elaine	Thanks for giving me a ride.

Adrian	Of course.

Adrian	So what happened?

Elaine	I'm not a hundred percent sure.

Elaine	Damon said it looked like somebody slashed

Elaine	his back tires last night.

Adrian	That's too bad.

Adrian	You're lucky I was free to give you a ride.

Elaine	Yes, thank you.

Elaine	I would have never made the physical for my audition,

Elaine	if I had to take the bus.

Adrian	Is that what you wear to dancing?

Elaine	Yeah, Damon just bought me the leggings.

Adrian	Huh.

Elaine	What?

Adrian	Oh, well, the leggings cover your scar completely.

Adrian	Covering your scar is sealing your pain.

Elaine	I don't really think he thought that much into it.

Adrian	Well, maybe not consciously, Elaine.

Adrian	Really it's the subconscious

Adrian	that drives most of our actions.

Elaine	Uh, you can take a left here.

Elaine	I'm actually gonna be a bit early

Elaine	so you can just drop me off at the cafe down the street.

Adrian	Need some company?

Elaine	Oh, that's all right.

Elaine	I have to work on some paperwork for the audition.

Adrian	I uh, know it's uncomfortable, Elaine.

Adrian	But I really would like to talk more

Adrian	on the subject of your injury

Adrian	when you're ready.

Elaine	When I'm ready.

Music	(menacing music)

Car	(door slamming shut)

Damon	Door open again.

Damon	Will this girl ever learn?

Damon	I'll text her right now.

Adrian and Damon	(Adrian and Damon grunting)

Car	(car horn honking)

Elaine	Damon?

Elaine	Damon?

Elaine	You in here?

Elaine	Damon, you have got to stop leaving my door open.

Elaine	Ms. Chan is gonna kill me if she...

Elaine	Oh my God, what happened?

Damon	Some dirt-bag broke in.

Elaine	What?

Damon	Luckily, we didn't leave anything

Damon	of value for him to take.

Elaine	And, and he attacked you?

Elaine	We, okay we, we need to call the police and we-

Damon	What are the police gonna do?

Damon	I mean, nothing was stolen.

Damon	I didn't get a good look at the guy.

Damon	We don't even have a security camera.

Damon	I'm just so glad that you weren't there.

Elaine	God, just seeing you like this shakes me up.

Elaine	So what are you doing here?

Damon	Uh, I got you something.

Elaine	A necklace.

Damon	You okay?

Damon	Hey, I can take it back if you-

Elaine	No, no, no, I really like it, and the leggings.

Elaine	Thank you.

Elaine	I just, it's kind of a lot right now, you know it's...

Elaine	I'll, um, I'll get you a fresh icepack.

Music	(foreboding music)

Damon	Oh gosh, I'm hungry.

Damon	Sushi or pizza?

Elaine	Sushi.

Damon	Mmm, yes, good choice.

Elaine	Thank you.

Elaine	Ooh, what's this?

Damon	(sighing) This better not be another ticket.

Elaine	Looks more like a wedding invitation, if you ask me.

Elaine	Last night was the best night of my life.

Elaine	Love Sandra.

Damon	Seriously?

Elaine	Yeah, okay, I'm gonna go.

Damon	No, Elaine, don't go.

Damon	How many times have I told she's an ex-dance partner.

Damon	I wasn't even with her last night.

Damon	I was home last night fixing my tire.

Elaine	You really expect me to buy that?

Damon	Ask my roommate.

Elaine	Yeah, I um, I actually just really cannot deal

Elaine	with this right now.

Elaine	So I'm just gonna.

Damon	Elaine.

Elaine	I'll call you.

Damon	Who writes notes?

Elaine	I haven't talked to Damon in a week.

Elaine	I mean, we were planning our whole future together.

Elaine	Not just our relationship but our careers too and-

Adrian	Wow.

Adrian	He's really spinning a web of lies around you.

Adrian	You know some men can't help

Adrian	but put their pleasure before monogamy.

Adrian	Do you fear you can't make it as a dancer without him?

Elaine	No.

Elaine	Well, maybe.

Elaine	I definitely can't nail the audition without him.

Adrian	Why is this audition so important to you?

Elaine	Well, I'm being scouted by this company.

Elaine	I've got the interview with the director coming up

Elaine	and then the audition, then

Elaine	it's just been my dream to dance

Elaine	for this company in New York
Elaine	ever since I was a little girl.

Elaine	I mean, I remember there were times I would go see them.

Elaine	And it was just-

Adrian	I'm sorry, can I, can I stop you there?

Adrian	You're leaving.

Elaine	Well, not if I don't perform.

Elaine	I'm sorry.

Elaine	I know that people usually pay for therapy

Elaine	and here I am just venting to you

Elaine	and I should be working for you.

Adrian	Well, maybe we can cut a deal.

Adrian	I can give you some more work around the house

Adrian	and we can schedule some more sessions together.

Elaine	Yeah, no, I'm happy to do anything you need.

Elaine	I can pick up laundry or grocery runs or-

Adrian	Actually, what I had in mind has more to do with my study.

Adrian	Would you mind if I filmed you?

Adrian	I can pay you very well.

Elaine	Filmed me doing what?

Music	(subdued music)

Girls	One, two, three on Elaine!

Elaine	You found me.

Lily and Mackenzie	Why do you hide up here? It's so high.

Elaine	All right, let me see.

Elaine	Gandhi, can anyone spell it?

Elaine	Where is she?

Lily	Um, here!

Elaine	In here?

Elaine and Lily	Ah, one, two, three on Mackenzie!


Girls	(girls laughing)

Elaine	I got you girls.

Adrian	I'm out of film.

Elaine	How am I doing?

Adrian	Perfect.

Elaine	I'm starving.

Adrian	Well, it is about lunchtime.

Elaine	Who wants sandwiches?

Girls	Me!

Adrian	Do you mind making them?

Elaine	Not at all.

Music	(doubtful music)

Adrian	Please have a seat.

Hank	You know, I'm glad we could do this.

Hank	My head's been all over the place since Silvia's passing.

Adrian	Is that what you wanted to talk about?

Hank	Look, man, when I first heard Silvia killed herself,

Hank	I didn't believe it.

Hank	To be honest, I told the police

Hank	I thought you had something to do with it.

Hank	But when I saw the look on your face when you arrived,

Hank	I thought I was wrong.

Adrian	Well, if you thought you were wrong,

Adrian	what's the issue?

Hank	It's just the text message she sent me was really weird.

Hank	I get the feeling it wasn't just a coincidence.

Hank	Like she was asking me for help.

Adrian	That text message was meant for her mother.

Hank	Well, if it was meant for her mother,

Hank	then why did she send it to me?

Adrian	Well, her mother's name is Hannah, and Hannah and Hank are

Adrian	right next to each other alphabetically.

Adrian	Can I ask you a personal question?

Hank	After I've interrogated you, please.

Adrian	Has someone close to you ever died?

Hank	Uh, yeah, my mother.

Adrian	What happened?

Hank	She had a heart attack when I was a young boy.

Hank	I didn't know what to do,

Hank	and didn't remember to call an ambulance

Hank	until it was too late.

Adrian	That's awful.

Adrian	But, uh, I understand.

Hank	What do you mean?

Adrian	Well, I don't think it's a stretch

Adrian	to say that you may still be trying

Adrian	to compensate for the death of your mother.

Adrian	And by investigating Silvia's death as suspicious,

Adrian	you're able to transfer your guilt onto someone else,

Adrian	someone like me.

Hank	Er, I'm sorry I don't think that's related.

Adrian	You wouldn't have realized, it's completely normal.

Phone	(phone buzzing)

Adrian	Do you mind if I get this?

Hank	Sure, of course.

Adrian	Thanks.

Adrian	Hello?

Computer	(computer beeping)

Hank	Molly.

Hank	Hannah huh?

Adrian	Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?

Hank	No, I'm good.

Lily	Eat your meat, darlin'.

Elaine	Okay, girls, now remember no socks or shoes

Elaine	for at least half an hour, okay?

Mackenzie	Okay.

Elaine	You okay, Lil?

Mackenzie	She's just sad because Adrian took Pegasus away

Mackenzie	and mommy gave her Pegasus.

Elaine	He did?

Elaine	Well, why'd he do that?

Lily	He put her in his office, cause I was being bad.

Elaine	Well, hey, maybe I can get her back for you?

Elaine	Yeah?

Elaine	Everybody, wait here and no socks.

Lily	Okay.

Hank	And hey, thanks for chatting.

Hank	Though, you know I still don't know how you continue

Hank	to live in a house where someone has died.

Hank	How do you sleep at night?

Adrian	Not well.

Adrian	I do you plan on moving soon.

Hank	I don't blame you.

Hank	Hey, I get off work most nights at 5:00.

Hank	Why don't you and the kids

Hank	and Molly come for dinner sometime?

Hank	I'm sure you could use a good home-cooked meal.

Adrian	Molly?

Hank	Uh, Silvia's mother.

Adrian	Yeah, that'd be nice, thanks, Hank.

Hank	Yeah, um, see you.

Music	(unsettling music)

Adrian	What are you doing?

Elaine	Um, Lily was feeling a bit down.

Elaine	I, I thought her stuffy might help.

Adrian	I'd actually prefer to give that back to her myself.

Adrian	I wouldn't want her to get resentful of me.

Elaine	Um, of course.

Elaine	Sorry I, I hadn't even thought about that.

Adrian	I finished work for the day.

Adrian	I should probably get you home.

Elaine	Mm-hmm.

Elaine	Here.

Elaine	Thank you.

Sofia	You have to jump.

Young Adrian	I don't want to.

Sofia	Children get scared.

Sofia	If you are going to be a man soon.

Young Adrian	I don't want to be a man.

Sofia	You have to be brave.

Young Adrian	I don't want to.

Sofia	Adrian, either jump in that pool right this moment,

Sofia	or I will push you in there.

Young Adrian	I don't want to.

Sofia	Adrian, take those couple of steps and just jump.

Sofia	Go on, just jump.

Young Adrian	I want Carla!

Sofia	Carla is gone, she doesn't want to babysit

Sofia	for you anymore.

Young Adrian	No, no, no!

Sofia	Do you know why Carla left?

Sofia	Because of this bad behavior of yours.

Sofia	It's your fault.

Sofia	So you jump in that pool and be a good boy, and swim.

Young Adrian	You swim.

Sofia	Don't you dare talk back to me.

Sofia	Now jump in that pool!

Music	(dramatic music)

Elaine	Dr. Pauline Cartwright used her own son

Elaine	for childhood analysis.

Elaine	Cartwright theorized that maturity could be induced

Elaine	if children were forced to take

Elaine	on the roles of an adult at a young age.

Elaine	Dying before her studies were published,

Elaine	her results have been inconclusive.

Damon	Hi, Lainy.

Elaine	What are you doing here, Damon?

Damon	Great to see you too.

Elaine	Seriously, what is it?

Damon	Do you still wanna audition for company?

Damon	Look, I know it's rocky between us,

Damon	but you cannot let that get in the way of your dream.

Damon	We have a few more days to practice.

Damon	Let's make the most of it as dance partners.

Elaine	I don't know.

Damon	Come on, Lainy, don't you want this?

Elaine	I don't know if I want this, Damon.

Elaine	I don't know if I can handle being let down again.

Damon	You won't be.

Damon	I booked the Performance Hall.

Damon	Okay, we have one day to practice on the big stage,

Damon	but we'll put you light years ahead of the other dancers.

Damon	Okay, Lainy, you're just so talented and-

Elaine	You booked the Performance Hall?

Elaine and Damon	(couple laughing)

Phone	(phone ringing)

Elaine	Hello?

Adrian	Hi, Elaine.

Adrian	Sorry to call so late.

Adrian	I've got a bit of a proposition for you.

Adrian	Do you mind if I come over?

Elaine	Uh, I'm actually with Damon.

Elaine	We're gonna rehearse.

Adrian	You're dancing again?

Adrian	With Damon?

Elaine	Yeah.

Elaine	We're trying to work on things.

Elaine	He booked the Performance Hall for tomorrow.

Elaine	You there?

Adrian	The Nightingale Performance Hall?

Elaine	Yeah, that's where auditions are being held this year.

Adrian	Elaine, that's, that's fantastic news.

Adrian	What I wanted to tell you is that

Adrian	I'm going to be moving to New York with the girls.

Adrian	They need closure and they're just not gonna get it here.

Adrian	I'm gonna need a live-in nanny,

Adrian	so if you do end up moving to New York

Adrian	maybe we can figure something out.

Elaine	Yes, yeah that would be amazing.

Elaine	Um I, I will definitely think about it.

Adrian	Please do think about it.

Adrian	I'm going to need a decision soon.

Elaine	Yeah!

Elaine	Yeah, I'll talk to you soon.

Damon	You okay?

Elaine and Damon	(couple laughing)

Music	(foreboding music)

Hank and Adrian	(Hank and Adrian grunting)

Music	(dramatic music)

Music	(somber music)

Elaine	(chuckling) I cannot believe you booked this.

Elaine	This must have cost a fortune.

Damon	I pulled some strings.

Elaine	It's kind of spooky in here

Elaine	without the audience or the dancers.

Damon	Just the nerves.

Damon	You ready?

Elaine	Yeah.

Elaine	Ready.

Damon	All right, let's get warmed up.

Music	(upbeat dance music)

Music	Hey

Music	I feel you

Music	Over there looking at me

Music	I like that

Music	Okay

Music	I bet you're wondering now

Music	Time to tell her goodbye

Music	You didn't even try

Music	To hide that sparkle in your eye

Music	I know what's fine

Music	You know what's going on

Music	You know what's going on

Music	We're both so curious

Music	Get over fear and just come and do it again

Music	Get over here, do it again

Music	Kill it, come and do it again

Music	Kill it, kill it, do it again

Music	Do it, do it, curious

Music	And now it's two of us

Music	We're both so curious

Music	Get over fear and just come and do it again

Music	Kill it, kill it, do it again

Music	Kill it, come and do it again

Music	Kill it, kill it

Elaine	(Elaine shrieking)

Elaine	Sorry, sorry, I know, um.

Elaine	Okay uh, take it from again from before the lift.

Damon	What's the point?

Elaine	Excuse me?

Damon	You're gonna screw this up,

Damon	if you don't get it out of your head.

Damon	Dancers need to trust their bodies.

Elaine	You're acting like this is my fault.

Damon	It's not my fault, I'm just looking out for you.

Elaine	Just like getting that letter wasn't your fault?

Damon	Seriously, what are we doing?

Damon	How many times do I have to tell you

Damon	I have no idea where that letter came from?

Damon	I didn't see her.

Damon	Call Charlie, he'll vouch for me.

Damon	Look.

Damon	I love you and only you, okay?

Damon	I know you feel it when we dance.

Damon	How our bodies move,

Damon	it's like we were meant to be together.

Elaine	Look, I'm gonna do the audition, okay?

Elaine	But if this doesn't work, I just,

Elaine	I need to figure out a future that's stable.

Damon	Okay.

Elaine	Okay?

Damon	As long as you're happy.

Damon	I love you.

Elaine	Um, all right, let's get out of here.

Elaine	I gotta get ready for this interview.

Damon	I'm just gonna go tell the manager

Damon and Elaine	that we're heading out. All right, I'll get changed.

Elaine	I'll meet you back at my place after.

Elaine	Wish me luck.

Music	(upbeat music) (object clanking in the distance)	

Music	(menacing music)

Music	(dramatic music)

Damon and Adrian	(Damon and Adrian grunting)

Damon	(Damon gasping)

Damon	What do you want?

Adrian	Elaine.

Girls	Adrian!

Adrian	Go wait in the car, okay?

Lily	Okay.

Girls	(girls laughing)

Adrian	Thanks for looking after the girls today.

Molly	I would like a schedule so I could see them more often.

Adrian	We're going to be moving away,

Adrian	so that's just not gonna be possible.

Molly	I suspected as much.

Adrian	What's this?

Molly	I am filing for custody.

Molly	I will see you in court.

Adrian	You two get in the car.

Mackenzie	I'm gonna go to my room.

Lily	Where's my Pegasus?

Adrian	She's in my office, remember?

Adrian	Want to go get her?

Lily	Mm-hmm.

Lily	Peggy!

Adrian	What do you say?

Lily	Please and thank you with sugar on top.

Adrian	Where did you learn that?

Lily	From Grandma, she says I'm gonna live with her soon.

Lily	(gasping) Peggy!

Adrian	You are never going to live with Grandma, okay?

Lily	I wanna live with her.

Adrian	You need to grow up, Lily.

Adrian	You need to learn that nothing in life is permanent.

Adrian	It's gonna help you mature.

Adrian	Go to your room now!

Adrian	Elaine, I wasn't expecting you.

Elaine	Hey, Adrian.

Adrian	Why don't you come in?

Adrian	Are you all right?

Adrian	What, what's wrong?

Elaine	Well I, I just came from my interview

Elaine	for the dance company.

Elaine	Um, I don't think it went so well.

Adrian	I'm sorry to hear that.

Elaine	Yeah but I, I wanted to tell you that

Elaine	I would love to accept the position

Elaine	whether or not I get into the company.

Adrian	That's wonderful news.

Adrian	Are you sure?

Elaine	Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about what you said

Elaine	about my strengths and purpose.

Elaine	I've always wanted to be a dancer,

Elaine	but lately it just seems

Elaine	like everything is working against that dream.

Elaine	When it comes to the girls, always been easy.

Adrian	Well, you'll be compensated extraordinarily well.

Adrian	But we're going to need to leave

Adrian	right after your audition.

Elaine	Oh, okay.

Phone	(phone buzzing)

Adrian	I'm so sorry, I've got to take this.

Elaine	Sure.

Adrian	Hello?

Lily	Elaine.

Elaine	Lily?

Lily	I'm right here.

Elaine	Hey, Lily-pad.

Elaine	What are you doing in your hiding spot?

Lily	He burnt Peggy.

Lily	I don't wanna go away with him.

Elaine	Adrian burnt Peggy?

Lily	Yes, I told him I want to live with Grandma.

Elaine	Oh, I know.

Elaine	Grandma is the best, but guess what?

Elaine	I'm gonna be coming with you guys.

Elaine	Adrian and I are gonna take good care of you,

Elaine	and I'll buy you a new Peggy.

Lily	Pinky promise.

Elaine	Pinky promise.

Lily	Elaine, I love you.

Elaine	Aw, Lil, I love you too.

Adrian	You tell her I will see her in court.

Lily	He's coming.

Lily	He's gonna get me.

Elaine	Oh, you're just being silly.

Elaine	I promise everything's gonna be fine, okay?

Elaine	Okay.

Elaine	I'll go.

Music	(subdued music)

Adrian	Sorry about that.

Elaine	It's okay.

Adrian	So we should, we should discuss the arrangements.

Elaine	I actually have to run and do a couple things.

Elaine	I just wanted to let you know,

Elaine	but I'm happy to come back tomorrow.

Adrian	Sure, of course.

Elaine	Okay.

Adrian	Elaine, I just wanted to tell you,

Adrian	you don't know what this means to me.

Elaine	All right, well, I will see you tomorrow.

Adrian	Tomorrow.

Elaine	Sure.

Elaine	Oh and um, Lily's in her hiding place, by the way.

Adrian	Thank you.

Elaine	Yeah.

Elaine	Hey, Damon, I'm back from the interview,

Elaine	thought you'd be here.

Elaine	Give me a call.

Elaine	I want to talk to you about New York.

Music	(foreboding music)

Silvia	(Silvia gasping)

Elaine	Hi, Detective Munro, um,

Elaine	I just watched a video of, of Silvia's death.

Elaine	I, I found it in, in um, Adrian's...

Elaine	No.

Elaine	Oh.

Elaine	No, okay, no, no, you have to come here.

Elaine	Please send help.

Elaine	I'm at the corner of 43rd and Hastings.

Elaine	Babe, don't go.

Elaine	Please.

Elaine	(Elaine gasping)

Elaine	Lily.

Elaine	(Elaine sobbing)

Music	(dramatic music)

Music	(record player playing music)

Adrian	Now then, what are you two gonna call me?

Mackenzie	Dad.

Adrian	Very good.

Adrian	Lily?

Lily	Daddy.

Adrian	And what happened to your mother?

Girls	She's gone forever because she doesn't love us.

Adrian	And who does love you?

Mackenzie	Dad.

Lily	Daddy.

Adrian	And who else?

Girls	Elaine.

Adrian	How would you feel if Elaine was your new mother?

Adrian	Would that make you happy?

Elaine	Mackenzie?

Elaine	Lily?

Adrian	Elaine.

Elaine	Hi.

Adrian	Everything all right?

Adrian	You look scared out of your wits.

Elaine	I'm fine.

Elaine	Damon canceled.

Elaine	Where are the girls?

Adrian	They're just washing their hands.

Adrian	Do you want to come in?

Adrian	We're just about to have dinner.

Adrian	Do you mind taking the roast out of the oven?

Adrian	My family.

Adrian	Elaine, serve the peas.

Adrian	You look stunning.

Adrian	Cheers.

Elaine	I thought once the girls were finished

Elaine	I could take them to the park.

Adrian	That won't be necessary.

Adrian	You'll be pleased to know I've almost completed my study.

Elaine	Congratulations, Adrian.

Adrian	Actually, I prefer if we kept things

Adrian	more formal at the table.

Adrian	Please call me doctor.

Elaine	Congratulations, doctor.

Adrian	It's quite remarkable.

Adrian	The New England Journal

Adrian	has expressed an interest in my study.

Adrian	I've proven how the roles

Adrian	within a family are completely inalterable.

Adrian	For instance, a woman must be submissive

Adrian	while a man must be dominant

Adrian	in order for a relationship to survive.

Elaine	What happens if she isn't submissive?

Adrian	There are ways to teach her.

Elaine	What about Sofia?

Adrian	Excuse me?

Elaine	Your mother.

Elaine	What happened to Sofia?

Adrian	She didn't choose me.

Adrian	And as all children do, I lashed out.

Adrian	Something you would never do if such an opportunity arose.

Adrian	You have everything, Elaine;

Adrian	an innocence, fragility,

Adrian	and you're obedient.

Adrian	You've hardly touched your dinner.

Elaine	I'm not very hungry tonight.

Adrian	Eat something!

Adrian	I insist.

Siren	(ambulance siren blaring)

Damon	(Damon moaning)

Doctor	It's gonna be okay, you're gonna be safe.

Damon	Agh!

Adrian	Now that little stunt you pulled at dinner,

Adrian	that's just not going to fly, okay?

Adrian	So your roles are going to include all motherly duties.

Adrian	Everything that Silvia may have done

Adrian	is now solely in your hands.

Adrian	And I hate to put it to you like this,

Adrian	but the apartment I found was only a two bedroom,

Adrian	so you and I are going to have to share a room.

Elaine	I am not going anywhere with you.

Adrian	What do you mean?

Music	(dissonant music)

Elaine	I found this next to Damon's body.

Elaine	He's dead.

Elaine	You killed him.

Adrian	No, no, no, no, no, I saved you.

Adrian	I could give you everything, do not betray me.

Elaine	Adrian, I saw the tapes.

Elaine	I saw what you did to Silvia.

Elaine	I saw how terribly your mother treated you,

Elaine	but you can get help, okay?

Elaine	You don't have to be like her.

Adrian	I am nothing like my mother!

Elaine	Adrian, get off of me.

Mackenzie	Can we play hide and seek?

Lily	I really want to play, please?

Lily	Please?

Adrian	Yes.

Adrian	Let's play.

Adrian	You two, stay with Elaine.

Mackenzie	We're gonna hide in the pantry.

Lily	I want to hide in the kitchen.

Elaine	Sh, sh, um.

Elaine	What if we hide in mommy's room?

Lily	Mommy's room.

Adrian	One,

Adrian	two,

Adrian	three,

Adrian	four,

Adrian	five.

Lily	We have to be quiet.

Adrian	Six.

Lily	Why aren't we in momma's room?

Adrian	Seven,

Adrian	eight,

Adrian	nine.

Elaine	Come on, we're gonna hide in my spot, outside, okay?

Mackenzie	What?

Lily and Mackenzie	No way. No, too high.

Mackenzie	It's really high.

Lily	Too scary, if you jump you're dead.

Mackenzie	She's right.

Lily	And it's really brr outside.

Elaine	Okay, okay, um.

Mackenzie	Yeah, never.

Elaine	I need you girls to go downstairs

Elaine	and hide in your very best hiding spots.

Lily	Yep.

Elaine	And don't come out until I find you.

Mackenzie	Okay.

Adrian	16

Adrian	17

Adrian	18

Adrian	19

Adrian	20

Adrian	Ready or not, here I come.

Music	(dramatic music)

Adrian	Found you.

Siren	(ambulance siren blaring)

Damon	Agh!

Detective	Take it easy kid, hang in there.

Damon	A,

Damon	A, Adrian.

Damon	Cartwright.

Damon	(Damon grunting)

Detective	Take it easy.

Adrian	One, two, three on Lily.

Elaine	(Elaine grunting)

Music	(dramatic music)

Adrian	Elaine.

Adrian	Elaine.

Adrian	Give me your hand.

Adrian	What are you doing?

Adrian	Elaine, Elaine!

Adrian	This is dangerous, Elaine, now come inside.

Adrian	Come inside.

Elaine	I am not going with you.

Adrian	This is childish, Elaine, look at what you're doing.

Adrian	Submit to me or fall.

Adrian	It's a long way, Elaine,

Adrian	off this ledge you could die.

Adrian	Forget your dance career, choose me, Elaine.

Adrian	Choose me.

Adrian	We could have the perfect family.

Adrian	I won't hurt you again.

Adrian	The perfect father, the perfect mother.


Elaine	You are never gonna be their father.

Adrian and Elaine	(Adrian and Elaine grunting)

Adrian	You're mine!

Siren	(police sirens blaring)

Music	(subdued music)

Detective	You did the right thing, Elaine.

Elaine	It's crazy how you cannot really know somebody.

Elaine	Maybe I just didn't wanna see him for what he was.

Detective	We believe we'll find proof of many more murders,

Detective	including that of his mother.

Elaine	I know he killed Silvia.

Elaine	I have evidence of it in my apartment.

Detective	Hey, get him in the car!

Elaine	What's gonna happen to him?

Detective	If the justice system does its job,

Detective	he'll go to prison for the rest of his life.

Elaine	Well, thank God.

Detective	Thank you, Elaine.

Detective	(somber piano music)

Dancer	Let's do this.

Damon	Hey, beautiful.

Elaine	Hi!

Dancer and Damon	What's up? What's up, dude?

Elaine and Dancer	See out there. Okay.

Elaine	You made it!

Damon	Of course, I'm not gonna miss

Damon	my girlfriend's leading debut performance.

Elaine	Did you bring the girls?

Damon	Yeah, they're in their seats already.

Elaine	You're the best.

Elaine	I love you.

Damon	I love you too.

Elaine	Okay, gotta go.

Damon	I'll see you after the show, yeah?

Elaine	Definitely.

Damon	Break a leg.

Allison Byrne	Damon, it's good to see you off your crutches!

Allison Byrne	Does this mean you and Elaine are ready to move to New York?	

Damon	I'm all bagged up and ready to go.

Allison Byrne	Excellent.
