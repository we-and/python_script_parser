(Sexy Nurses)


?	Well no it has a slogan, Barry. Remember? It was my idea... ?the economically sound condom.

?	The "E-Con" a "dome” for a man's love boat.

?	Don, that line of rubbers had George Washington's mug on the tip...

?	his face, Don. A man's face.

?	Dollar condoms, Boss!

?	C'mon a dollar a shot for those suckers, now that's a sexy price.

?	Besides, it was only the tip.

?	A sexy price... Don, boobs are sexy, big bouncing boobs.

?	Keep the founding fathers crap off the condoms, Don. 

?	Barry's right, Don. No founding fathers on the condoms...

?	can't sell the founding fathers.

?	 Can't sell 'em... You, Don.

?	Are a thrusted marketing pro. You know the drill, if it's hot it sells.

? 	No founding fathers.

? 	Great, next thing you’re gonna tell me you're gonna pull the double wide jolly with deluxe too.

?	The jolly what?  The celebrity condom, Mr. Tate.

? 	Celebrity condoms, why not? Movie stars get laid!
 
?	 I need a drink. Can we stop?

?	No, really, can we just stop for a minute, ok? Alright.

?	 I've got something else, try to focus.

?	It's about a job.

?	I'm sending you back into the field, Don.

?	 Back to the Midwest?

?	 No shut it, it's about a sex treatment center in Des Moines.

?	It's a place where folks go to work out their sexual problems, deal with their fantasies, whatever.

?	Don, if you could help me grab a couple of leads down there, I'm willing to pump your bank account a little bit.

?	You want me to pitch them some ideas?  No, you imbecile.

?	Pretend for a minute that you’ve got some sort of a sex problem that needs healing

?	I'll deal with the story.

?	I wanna know everything about everything, techniques what kind of questions they

?	role-playing.

?	You know what I’m talking about, Don.

?	 Under the covers, huh?  Bring back the juice, Don.

?	And we will corner the market on the sex intel.

?	 And if I agree?

?	 Let's just say that Christmas comes early.
 

?	I need you, Don.

?	Thrusted needs you.

?	But what about my wife?  I'll inform her.

?	Don't worry, Don.  So... what's the name of this place?

? 	What is the name of this place?  "Lovebush"

?	 Love Bush.

?	Yea.

?	Well then... I'm your man.

?	Good, there's one catch.

?	I want you to take Pete Saunders along with you.

?	Oh no, not Pete! You gotta be kidding me!

?	Now go make me proud.

? 	I love the way you delegate authority Mr. Tate.

? 	Oh really? Well what else do you love, baby?

?	Oh really. I happen to have one of those right here.

?	 Ooh... Tate... oh yes.

?	Yes! Oh!

?	Oooh!
 

?	Oh Mr. Tate.

?	Oh you rocked my love bush.

?	 Yea. Love... Bush.

?	Yea. I like the sound of that.

 ?	I told Tate, I said Tate, call me Pete. You know what he said?

?	"Shabang!"  I don't get it!

?	Just stop talking, will ya?

? 	Gentleman!

?	You're late.

?	Come in.

?	 Pardon me.  Don't blow it.

?	 Gentleman. Welcome to Love Bush, I'm Doctor Know.

? 	Like in the movie?
?	No, like... I know what’s on your dirty mind.

? 	Nice choppers. You have like a biker clientele?

? 	Gentleman, these are mine.

?	Come let me give you a tour.
 
?	And that's what makes Love Bush Clinic so special.


?	Full mental and sexual treatment.

?	And there you have it, boys.

?	You've been signed in until I deem you fit for release.

? 	But I thought only a few days.

?	That's not how we do things here at Love Bush.

?	We want results, we get them. You could be here for awhile.

?	Somebody gag me?  Peter Murphy Saunders...

?	arrested twice for indecent exposure in a women's public toilet.

?	I've read your file.

?	I... uh... it was research, Doc!

?	Scouts honor, I swear.

?	Flashing your Peter at department store

?	ladies room is not research, Mr. Saunders.  I read the signs wrong.

?	 Hey, lay off him. We all have our problems.

?	That's why we're here. We'll stay as long as it takes.

?	That's the attitude I like, Mr. Blander

?	I'm sure we have certain ointments that

?	will clear up your genital rash in no time.

?	Rash?  The one on your Johnson.

?	Excuse me.
 

?	You got a rash! I'm stuck in the ladies room.

?	What did Tate tell her about us?  Be cool, Pete!

?	We need all the info we can get. Get in, get out.

?	Yes, I submitted my report to the board yesterday, Doctor.

?	Yes, of course, Doctor, yes.

?	Oh Doctor, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

?	You promised me those reports, you're late again. Naughty, naughty.
 	?I'm so sorry, I need more time! I need more time.

?	We've got all the time in the world.

?	Not bad for my first sex fantasy, aye Doc?

?	 Not bad at all.

?	I say two, three days tops. Maybe four.

?	Couples therapy, huh?  You're not married.
?	No, but you are.  Leave my wife out of this.

?	Focus on the report.

?	That doctor she asks like a million questions.
 
?	 Me too!

?	I have never heard the word penis so many times in my ?life. Penis this, penis that, penis butter... penis, penis, ?penis!

?	Well put it in the report. What do you call those kind of questions?

?	Call? Stupid is what they call 'em.

?	No, no, no, no... it's uh... psycho-analisitic...

?	It's on the tip of my tongue.
 	?Psychoanal... anal... anal something like that.

?	Well just remember a few of the questions and write

?	'em down because Tate's gonna need to know.

?	Like Tate can read.

?	Look, these guys are total dopes.

?	One's a sexual deviant, the other one jerks off his pony in public.

?	I need three nurses right away.

?	I don't care if they just graduated. Send them now.

?	And they better be damn good.

?	Alright ladies, introduce yourselves.

?	I'm Faye.  Um, call me Dakota.
 

?	Like the state.  Evangeline.

?	But Eva's ok with me.

?	Do you recognize this?

?	Do you girls have experience with sexual deviants?

?	Sigmund Freud ring a bell?
? 	Of course I've had sex, but Freud, wasn't he a famous dentist?

?	No, I mean professional sexual experience.

?	You've studied sexual therapy, no?

?	I believe sex should be personal and not professional.

?	What do you mean?

?	 Ms. Claudette, what Dakota and Eva are trying to say is

?	that yes we have the relevant experience to handle the difficult work here at the Love Bush Clinic, you can trust us to do the job.

?	Great! Then go hit the showers, you have one hour before your first session.

?	So are we supposed to get it on with these guys?

?	It's against the rules, Dakota. We can pleasure the patients.

?	Rules "shmules."

?	Doctor Know hired us so she wouldn't have to break the rules.

?	Exactly so let's show 'em who's in control.

?	Control yourselves and have patience please.

?	I didn't go into debt to jerk off business men in a sex clinic.

?	Well it'll be our asses if we don't produce results.
 
?	Eva's right.  No, no, no.

?	Results yes, but we're nurses, not a street gang.

?	Come on I bet a nice hot shower would do us all good.

?	Now you're talking my language.
?	The language of hot suds.

?	And his boss says you don't need sexual treatment.

?	Sexual treatment? Problems with my husband?

?	I'm so confused. Donny's ok, isn't he?

?	I met with your husband yesterday Mrs. Blander and this morning too.
?	He touches himself quite a bit you know.  His thing?

?	Well that's a first.

?	Don's a dead fish in the sack.

?	I don't follow.  Dead fish.

?	He just lies there.
?	Last time we did it he passed out inside of me.

?	Fatigue he said.

?	 Well his file said something about a rash... but.

?	 A rash? Oh dear! Maybe this is a sign.
 
?	The cheater.

?	I knew it!  What are you saying?

?	Calm down.

?	Faye you do whatever it takes to heal my husband no matter how severe.

?	I never should have let him work for that damn sex toy company.

?	The jerk.

?	They're called marital aids, not sex toys, thank you.

?	Did you take your medication, Don? You're supposed to be in session with Eva.

?	Well I skipped class. Honey, how are you.

?	What are you doing here, Don? What's up with this rash?

?	What don't all dead fishes get rashes?

?	Ok, relax both of you. Now kiss your wife, Don.

?	I said kiss your wife. Come close.
?	 What here by the pool?  Yes!

?	And do it like you mean it.

?	Get close Mrs. Blander. Closer.

?	See what some couples need as a little spice, just a pinch of something strong and wet.

?	Good! Good!
 
?	Now you're gonna obey me and you're gonna like it.

?	 Oh my god!

?	You know I think my girls were right.

?	Screw the rules.

?	You want results, Dr. Know? Then it's results you're gonna get.

?	You challenged the wrong nurses.

?	Alright listen up, I've had a change of heart.

?	 Are we in trouble?  I only looked Faye, I didn't touch.

?	 I've considered what you said about giving those two dopes a good slap.

?	 They deserve more than that.  You're absolutely right, Eva.

?	They're unruly, annoying and dirty, and I've had enough.

?	 What about the rules? You said...

?	 What I said is dead.

?	Aren't you sick of these pigs feeling you up?

?	Yea.  For sure.

?	Then don't go gently, we're the ones who now call the shots.

?	We are the savage nurses.
 
?	Yea, savage nurses!

?	Savage nurses!

?	Ladies room, huh? I bet you like getting off in the department store.

?	 Is this some kind of new treatment lady?
?	 The name's not lady, it's Dakota.  Oh, right.

?	Uh.. hey, where's my friend?

?	Your friend's being taken care of just like I'm gonna take care of you.

?	This is something new.  Take your medicine Sweet Pea.

?	Sweet pea! I like that.

?	Every picture tells a story.

?	You want it, bad boy? I want you to beg for more.

?	Yes, Mam.

?	Take my tits, suck 'em.

?	Good boy.

?	Now slap my ass.

?	That's good. I think you're getting better already.

?	You're doing good.

?	Getting better already.

?	 What in the world is going on here!

?	 Special treatment, double dose, you wanna join?

?	 I wanna see you and your two tramps friends in my office immediately!

?	 How you feeling Mr. Blander?

?	 Thanks for chalking my stick.

?	 Do you know what it is we do here at Love Bush?

?	 It's a sex hospital.

?	To cure the sexually maladjusted.

?	That's right, what we don't do here at Love Bush is rub our mammary glands all over men's faces.

?	Why are you laughing?

?	You ever rubbed your tits in front of some guy's face?

?	 What!  You heard Dakota.

?	Look, why aren't there any other patients here besides the two guys?

?	 Are you asking me?  Afraid to answer?
 

?	You think you're so smart, don't you?

?	You three think you can high heel it in here and turn my place into a whore house.

? 	He's my patient you prude and I helped him.

?	I think you could use a little help too Dr. Know.

?	What's wrong, no little "dicky" at home to tuck you in at night?

?	Or do you like girls?

?	I'd make out with you.  Shut your filthy mouth!

?	And what if I don't? What are you gonna do about it?

?	 Honey, you don't know who you're dealing with.

?	 Deal with this.

?	 You can't... you can't...  Get her, get her.

?	 Get her Faye!

?	 Go Faye!

? 	Look at her...

?	 This how you wanna do it?

?	 Get her Faye!

?	Get her Faye!  Yea, go Faye.

?	What about me?

?	You gonna make me feel good?

?	Open your legs.
 
?	 Get it Dr. Know.

?	I'm gonna punish you.

?	That's right Faye.
?	C'mon girls.

?	Thanks for the fling Doctor.

?	It'll be a joy trying to explain to the board how you savaged me in your office.

?	I gave you a chance, you three are the most savage nurses I've ever seen.

?	Savage, huh? I couldn't have said it better.

?	We'll give you what you want, we'll put this place on the map.

?	Get out all of you! Get out!

?	I want you gone in 24 hours! You're fired!

?	File your final reports and pack your bags.

?	 Or what?

?	I'll see to it that you never work in this town again.

?	You heard the woman girls, we have until sun down tomorrow.

?	We'll do the paperwork, even put it on your desk and pack our bags and go.

?	I think you've made yourself quite clear.

?	Girls?  Let's get out of here.

?	Ditto.

?	Can you believe that?  We gotta get out of dodge and quick.

?	No, no, not after what happened this morning.

?	I'm getting more intel than the CIA.

?	You know that nurse Dakota?
 
?	Well I think she outdid my wanger, it aches man.


?	What are you talking about?  These girls are sex nuts, Don! No ?telling what they're gonna do.

?	Just role with it.

?	Trust me we'll have Tate eating out of our pockets in no time.
?	 Alright, c'mon.


?	We're done, Faye, let's start packing.  We aren't going anywhere yet.

?	What do you mean?  We still have work to do, remember?

?	But that crazy Dr. Know!

?	Look we got one shot and one shot only. Trust me.

?	I have a plan.

?	Hey, Don.

?	What do you think about a dildo that shoots electricity out the tip!

?	A dildo laser!

?	I can't believe those nurses were fighting.

?	Maybe it was some kind of therapy.

?	Hey, maybe we can use that?  Cat fights, yea!

?	We can use that!

?	Get 'em girls! And you, put down that pad.

?	We need a favor, boys. Just a helping hand.

?	And you're gonna help us whether you like it or not.

?	You're not gonna hurt us, are you?  No, you're gonna do us a little favor.

?	We're gonna dial a number and you need to pretend
 

?	shouldn't be too hard. Huh, Don?


?	Maybe if you do good we'll give you a special treat.

?	Ok, I'll do it.

?	Making yourself at home I see.

?	Well you'll be out of my hair soon enough, before that though I need you to keep an eye on the patients and then tuck them in.  Got a date?

?	I got a call from your advisor, Professor Dinky.

?	Seems I was asked to give a lecture on the benefits of the penis pump this afternoon.
?	Sounds hard.

?	Hardly, I am prepared.

?	I'm sure you'll pump him up real good.

?	I happen to be an expert on the topic, thank you.

?	Prepping the pump, huh?

?	Stop your gibberish!

?	I'll be back after sundown and you better be gone.

?	So long savage nurses and good riddance.

?	 Forget about her, let's have desert.

?	I'll say.

?	Finally, time for some fun.
 

?	We have desert!


?	Here we go.


?	Blondes, brunettes, anything just tell us it's juicy.

?	Sex juice.

?	What?  My idea for a new energy drink.

?	Sex juice.  I wouldn't mind a sip of that.

?	Boss!  Lydia, Boss...

?	Shut up both of you.  There's been a change of plan.

?	A change of what? No, we like it here.

?	Nonsense, bigger fish to fry.

?	Mr. Takahashi arrives tomorrow and you two nimrods are to pitch your idea to him.

?	I've got a lot riding on this.  But we're not ready yet!

?	Well be ready. Nine o clock tomorrow morning, sharp.

?	Two new patients I see.

?	One of our nurses, Dakota.

?	North or south?

?	Does it matter?  No, it does not, outstanding.

?	Can I offer you something to drink?  A single malt scotch would be lovely.

?	Actually I'd really like some fresh air I'm feeling a little faint.

?	Why don't you come with me outside, I'll show you around.

?	We gotta change his mind on this quick.

?	So what do you think of the grounds?  It's so beautiful.
 
?	I'm feeling a lot better already but you could take it to 100%.
? 	How's that?

?	That sure was nice.

?	You're not too shabby yourself, babe. Now why are you two here?

?	We're getting Don and Pete out of here.  Leaving so soon?

?	We can't have that, they haven't finished their treatment.

?	Bosses orders.  We'll see about that.

?	No! No! No!

?	No!

?	This is ridiculous! Let me go!

?	You come to our house you play by our rules!

?	You got it?

?	 Listen, at least give me another cocktail it's hot in here.

?	I could have a stroke in this Love Bush.

?	 We'll stroke you off later, just stay put.

?	 Unbelievable.

?	 Oh you better believe it sister.

?	 What are we going to do?
?	 Don't struggle, baby. Don't worry about anything.

?	You're here with Barry Tate.  Oh God.
 

?	 Hey, what's this all about ladies?  It's your final session.

?	How do you feel?  No, no it can't be. I'm not ready.

?	I don't want to go back to my wife.

?	That means you need to go back to your wife.

?	Time to dream, imagine we are your wives.

?	 We missed you so much Donny poo.

?	 Oh boy, this is getting confusing.

?	Just relax.

?	Let us heal you.

?	We wanna heal you.

?	 Honey, your boobs, they're bigger...more succulent.

?	You like my body, babe?

?	Happy new year.  Double trouble.

?	Now it's time to take your medicine and stay with us.

?	Forever.

?	 How do you feel?  I think I was dreaming.

?	I thought I saw my wife. Is my wife here?

?	Everything is ok, Don, you underwent self hypnosis.

?	How did I do?  You were no dead fish, that's for sure.

?	 Thank you. No, really, thank you, thank you, thank you.

? 	One down and one to go.
 
?	 We better get Faye for this one,

?	we got something special planned for this guy Pete.

?	Penis pumps, penis pumps my ass whoever set me up is going down.

?	Can I help you?

?	 I hope so, I'm Don's wife, he's a patient here.

?	Yes, yes indeed I remember you.

?	Don sure has good taste in women. I'm Claudette the head Doctor.

?	I heard yelling, are you ok?

?	Oh it's nothing. Just an immature practical joke.

?	Lucky for me it's over.

?	Now, what can I do for you?

?	I came here to speak with my husband but...

?	since you're here...

?	Yes?  Could we talk somewhere more private?

?	It's very important.

?	 Well, we could go to my room if you like.

?	I'd like that very much.

?	Right this way then.
 
?	So what's so important?

?	This.

?	Come on Boss, tell us how bad we've been.

?	I don't know if I can do this.  You have to, baby.

?	It's your last shot at the Thrusted crown.

?	We want it, we want you to dominate us, be bossy.

?	You're fired, you're fired and you're fired!

?	I did it!

?	Good job, honey!

?	You did it.  You fired us up.

?	It's great to be the king.

?	Hey, what was that sound?

?	I heard something too! It sounded like those damn nurses!

 ?	Those nurses are good, that one Faye she helped Don and I down by the pool.

?	They're still here, I told them to be gone by sundown and I can't believe it.

?	Time to take out the trash!

?	 Wait, I'm coming!

?	 Nurses! Nurses, where are you!
 
?	 Let's go!

?	 Where did you get that knife?  I always carry this with me.

?	I told you, you're safe with Barry Tate. Let's go!

?	 Nurses!  Nurses, where are you!

?	 Petey, Don, where the hell are you!

?	Wait a minute, who are you looking for?

?	 The savage nurses, who are you looking for?

?	 Well the two morons, who else?

?	 Where could they be?  If you were a moron where would you be?

?	In the back, let's go!

?	How we looking on those reports, think we have enough intel?

?	We've got more than enough. Lydia, Boss!

?	Welcome, nice of you to join us.  What is the meaning of all this!

?	I told you girls to be gone.

?	Sorry Doctor but I don't understand, you asked us to take care of these wonderful patients and we did.

?	Is this a joke?  This doesn’t look like a joke to me.

?	Nice work ladies, seems to me like you've done a fine job.

?	Donny, Petey, are you ready for tomorrow's meeting?

?	 We'll be there Boss.  Bright and early.

?	I guess all's well that ends well.  Not for me.

?	You broke me, you broke me!
 
?	Ladies, I thin Ak it’s time we show Claudette the benefits of our special methods.

? 	No hard feelings, Claudette.  C'mon dear, let's cheer you up.
