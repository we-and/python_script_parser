(VERY IMPORTANT SHEEP)

THOMAS	Hello, everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	Being careful and not rushing things.

THOMAS	When The Fat Controller asked Percy to take the Very Important Sheep to the Spring Fair, Percy was so worried about being late that he wasn't very careful. 

THOMAS	He bumped the livestock wagon and made a big hole in it. But Percy was in such a hurry he didn't notice.

THOMAS	Every time Percy stopped, more of the sheep jumped out through the hole!

THOMAS	And by the time Percy got to the Fair, there were no sheep left in his wagon at all! 

THOMAS	Luckily I found Percy's sheep and I took them to the Fair.

THOMAS	Percy realised he'd been rushing so much he hadn't been very careful. If Percy had slowed down, he wouldn't have had an accident and the sheep wouldn't have escaped.

THOMAS	That's why it's important to be careful and not rush when you have an important job to do!
