Rick	Hi, baby. 

Susan	(moans) Whoo! (laughs) 

Rick	(laughs) 

Susan	Oh! (moans) 

Rick	(moans) 

Susan	(moans) (gasps) Ah! Ah! 


Staff	(walla) 

Detective Blake	All right, Mister Taylor. Why don’t you just have a seat right there? I’m sorry for bothering you at this time but we wanna ask you some questions about your wife’s death, of course.

Rick	Right.

Detective Blake	This is detective Kramer, I’m detective Blake. Now the coroner reported that the death took place between two and three “P.M.” on Tuesday night. Now where were you about that time?  

Rick	I was in my car taking a drive.

Detective Kramer	Where were you going?

Rick	I just, uh… finished playing tennis with a friend of mine so I decided to, uh… take a cruise. 

Detective Kramer	Anybody with you?

Rick	No. I… I wanted to be alone. What are you trying to imply here? 

Detective Blake	Oh… We’re not implying anything. Just that… kind of a coincidence, don’t you think? You happen to be taking a little drive at the same time your wife’s getting strangled? 

Rick	I loved my wife, detective. 

Detective Blake	Well, plenty of husbands love their wives, Mister Taylor.

Rick	Wait a second here. What are you trying to say? 

Detective Kramer	We’re saying you need an alibi. 

Rick	Uh… (sighs) I wanna talk to a lawyer. 

Detective Blake	Oh… so you need a lawyer now? 

Rick	Are you charging me with anything, detective? 

Detective Blake	Not yet. 

Rick	Can I go? 

Detective Blake	Sure. Only--as they say on “T.V.”--don’t try to leave town. 

Rick	Excuse me. 

Detective Blake	(sighs)

Detective Kramer	He’s lying.


Rick	Jenny, did… did you see him? At the cemetery?

Jenny	Who?  

Rick	Detective Blake. The guy who brought me in for questioning. 

Jenny	What was he doing there? 

Rick	I… I don’t know. Maybe he was spying on me or something. (sighs) 

Jenny	Does he suspect you? 

Rick	Maybe. He asked me where I was when Susan was murdered and if I had an alibi. 

Jenny	An alibi? I thought they suspected a stranger or some burglar committing the murder. 

Rick	Yeah, so did I. But since I can’t account for my whereabouts at the time of the murder, I’m a suspect. 

Jenny	(sighs) Well, you could say you’re with me. I’ll be your alibi. 

Rick	(sighs) No, it’s too late. I already told him I was alone. Let’s go inside. 

Jenny	(sighs) (sniffs) (sighs) It was a lovely ceremony. (cries) Susan would have loved it. 

Rick	Yeah. 


Jenny	(cries) Rick, I still can’t believe it. 

Rick	(sighs) Neither could I. 

Jenny	We weren’t close but she was a good sister. (cries) I loved her. 

Rick	She thought a lot about you. Do you remember the last thing you said to her? 

Jenny	(sniffs) No. I wish I did. (cries)

Rick	Yeah, well, I do. (laughs) I said, “Hey, Susan. Make sure you get my shirts.”

Jenny	(laughs) 

Rick	(laughs) 

Jenny	(cries) But what about you, Rick? How can I help you get on with your life? 

Rick	Hey, listen. You’ve done great already. I just think I need to spend some time alone. That’s all. 

Jenny	(cries) But you’ve hardly been out since it happened. Don’t shut yourself in. (cries) Let me help you. 

Rick	Okay. I will. But I just need to be alone right now. 

Jenny	(sniffs) (sighs) Okay. But if you need me, please call. (cries) 

Rick	(gasps) (sighs)

Rick	Yeah, baby! Give it to me. Give it to me! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! Oh! 

The Stranger	Oh! Oh!

Rick	Yeah! Ah! (gasps) (sighs) 


Detective Blake	Mister Taylor. Thought I’d, uh… stop by. Ask you a couple questions about your wife. Do you mind? 

Rick	Uh… no, I don’t actually. Uh… I have nothing to hide. Come in. 

Detective Blake	Thanks.

Rick	You want a drink? 

Detective Blake	Well, it’s, uh… tempting but I’m on duty. 

Rick	Well, detective, I’ve already told you everything. 

Detective Blake	Yeah. I know. But, uh… I thought I’d get you away from all the stress of the police station. You know sometimes people can think clear or remember things in the comfort of their own home. 

Rick	Well, let me tell you something you’re wasting your time. I don’t have anything else to tell you. So if you don’t mind, I have some work to do. 

Detective Blake	Oh… Yeah. Sure. Sure. Uh… one thing though, uh… When your wife died, you said the door was unlocked, right? 

Rick	Yes. Like… like I told you before. I took a drive after I finished a round of tennis with a friend of mine. I came home.


Rick	(cont’d) I called out to Susan and she didn’t respond. Susan? 

Detective Blake	And then? 

Rick	Sue? Well, I knew she was here, because her car was in the driveway… Suzy? …So I began looking for her. Sue? Suzy? Oh, my god! Suzy! 

Detective Blake	So that’s when you found her, huh? 

Rick	Yes. And then I dialed “9-1-1.”

Detective Blake	Hmm… Well, after investigating the crime scene, I’d definitely say your wife knew her assailant. Question is do you know anybody that might want to hurt her? 

Rick	(sighs) Jesus Christ. Here we go again. Detective, I already told you. I loved my wife. Why do you think I would kill her? 

Detective Blake	Oh, Jesus, Taylor. I didn’t accuse you of anything. Yet. I’m gonna tell you something. With eyes like you have, you should never play poker ‘cause I can see you lying. You’re hiding something right now. I don’t know what it is, but I’m gonna find out sooner or later.

Rick	Well, you know what, detective? I got work to do. So if you don’t mind…

Detective Blake	Right. All right. Well, uh… if you do think of anything just give me a call, okay? Day or night. Thanks for the beer. I’ll show myself out. 

Detective Kramer	Well, did you squeeze anything else out of him? 

Detective Blake	Hell, no. Let’s go over it again, all right? 

Detective Kramer	Sure. 

Detective Blake	Okay. Rick Taylor gets a computer company and then he becomes an internet multi-millionaire. 

Detective Kramer	Settles down in suburbia with a small-time actress.

Detective Blake	(sighs) Yeah. And then a year later she gets it. 

Detective Kramer	Happens every day. 

Detective Blake	Yeah. Only problem is I… he had two alarm systems in that house. 

Detective Kramer	Anybody else have the entry codes besides Taylor and his wife? 

Detective Blake	No, I don’t know. Maybe a maid. Gardner. Somebody.

Detective Kramer	Or girlfriend. Did he tell you he was cheating? 

Detective Blake	Well, he didn’t have to. One look in that eye… (laughs) No. Sweet face like that, he’s probably “boinking” everybody in sight. 

Detective Kramer	Okay, we got a cheating husband having a good time with the babes. His wife catches him and, uh… she wants a divorce. 

Detective Blake	Right. Then he has to split it in “fifty-fifty.” Right? He didn’t like that idea. 

Detective Kramer	So it’s “off” the wife.

Detective Blake	Yeah. Maybe. Only problem is, partner… (sighs) If he was planning this thing, why wouldn’t he have a solid alibi? 

Detective Kramer	Maybe he wasn’t alone. 

Detective Blake	I like that possibility. 

Detective Kramer	What do you want to do? 

Detective Blake	Well, I say we just watch him close. Put a noose around his neck… (sighs) …if his accomplice shows up, we’ll just give him enough rope to hang himself. 

Detective Kramer	And if the accomplice doesn’t show up?

Detective Blake	We’ll tie the noose ourselves, partner. 

Susan	Hi, honey. (gasps)

Rick	(gasps) (gasps)

Susan	(moans)

Rick	(moans) (gasps) 

Susan	(moans) 	

Rick	(moans) 

Susan	(moans) (gasps) Oh… 

Rick	Oh…

Susan	Oh! Oh! Oh!

Rick	Oh! 

Susan	Oh! Oh! (moans) (gasps) (moans) Oh! (gasps) Oh! Oh! 

Rick	Oh!

Susan	Oh! Ooo… (moans) 

Rick	(moans) (moans) Oh…

Susan	Oh! Oh! (moans) 

Rick	(moans)

Susan	Oh! 

Rick	Oh!  Oh!

Susan	Oh! 

Rick	Yeah, baby. 

Susan	Oh! (moans) (gasps) (moans) Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! 

Rick	Oh! 

Susan	Oh! 

Jenny	Hi, Rick. It’s Jenny. Just checking in to see how you’re doing. If you get a moment, give me a call. I’d like to talk to you. Love you. 

Rick	(sighs) Holy fucking shit. (gasps) (sniffs) Uh… yes. Detective Blake, please. Well, get him out of the goddamn meeting! This is, uh… this is Rick Taylor! I got something really important to tell him! Blake, listen. (gasps) I just discovered something I think you should see. You gotta get over here right away. 


Detective Blake	What do you got? 

Rick	Come with me. 

Detective Blake	Oh, “jeez”… is this some kind of joke? Huh? This is what’s supposed to get you off the hook now. Is that it? 

Rick	I didn’t write that!

Detective Blake	(sighs) Then who did, huh? Come on. You gotta do better than this, Taylor. 

Rick	Somebody accessed my computer and put it on the screen. The person who wrote it just confessed! 

Detective Blake	Yeah? Yeah, well… how can somebody access your computer if they don’t have the password?

Rick	I… I… I don’t know. My… my internet company is still doing business with a number of people who have limited access to my files. 

Detective Blake	Yeah? How many people have this privilege? 

Rick	Uh… I don’t know. Uh… five hundred maybe? 

Detective Blake	“Five hundred?” Five… gee you… you’re really starting to piss me off. You know that? Five hundred people? All right. Of these five hundred, how many do you suppose would have a motive to murder your wife?  

Rick	I… I don’t know. 

Detective Blake	Think.

Rick	(sighs) Unless…

Detective Blake	What? Unless what? 

Rick	(groans) Detective, detective… (sighs) (sighs) Well, detective, a couple of years ago I started cheating on my wife through internet fantasy chat rooms. My buddy turned me on to it. (laughs) At first I thought it’d be harmless fun, you know?  

Sasha	Hi, Rick. I’ve always wanted to be watched by someone unseen. Someone near but not too close. It has to be someone I don’t know. There’s something about the element of danger that really excites me. (laughs) 

Rick	(moans) Man… That woman is so hot. (laughs) And as time went on, she… she wanted more. 

Detective Blake	What do you mean?

Rick	Well, um… every Wednesday, Susan would go grocery shopping. It was her routine, so…

Susan	I’m going to the grocery store. Do you want anything? 

Rick	No, I’m okay. 

Susan	Okay. Bye, honey.

Rick	Bye. What’s the matter, honey? You forget your keys? Okay, okay, okay…

Sasha	I’m Sasha.

Rick	I know. 

Sasha	Well, don’t look so stunned.

Rick	What are you doing here? 

Sasha	You know where I live and now I know where you live. 

Rick	(groans) Come on. What the hell are you doing? 

Sasha	Well, you got to watch me so I thought it was only fair that I get to watch you. 

Rick	My wife just left!

Sasha	She doesn’t have to know. I promise I won’t tell. 

Rick	Oh, you’re so hot! (laughs)

Sasha	(laughs) (moans) 

Rick	Okay…

Sasha	Oh… 

Rick	Uh… hello?

Susan	Hey, honey. I just pulled up to the market. What did you want for dinner? I was thinking tuna casserole? 

Rick	Um… I… I don’t know, honey. Are… are… are melons in season? 

Susan	I think so. Since when did you start eating melons? 

Rick	I just… I saw something on the internet and they said that melons were good for the libido. 

Susan	Really? (laughs) What kind of melons? 

Rick	Big juicy ripe ones. 

Susan	Why do you sound so strange?

Rick	Uh… I don’t know. I feel a little stiffness coming on. 

Susan	(laughs) Well, take care. I’ll be home as soon as I can.

Rick	Oh, no. No, honey. Don’t rush on my account. Uh… Something’s just come up and I gotta take care of it. 

Susan	Well, it sounds like you have your hands full. Love ya’. 

Rick	I… I love you, too. (moans) 

Sasha	(gasps) (moans) Oh! Oh! (moans) Oh… (gasps) (moans) Oh! Oh! (moans)

Rick	(moans)

Sasha	Oh! Oh! (moans) Uh! Oh! Oh! 

Rick	Yeah! 

Sasha	Yeah! Oh! (moans) Oh! (moans) Oh! (moans) Oh! 

Rick	It was like something that I’ve never experienced. Before I knew it, I was hooked. I mean I was on the internet every single night, fulfilling all these fantasies with all these different women. And then when I had the opportunity, I would meet with them. And then I began having affairs. 

Detective Blake	How many affairs did you have?

Rick	Well, there were four steady ones and I think about six “one-night stands.” 

Detective Blake	And, uh… your wife never suspected, huh? 

Rick	No. Not at first. 

Detective Blake	Lucky. 

Computer Girl	Oh! Oh! Oh! (moans) 

Susan	(sighs) Hi, honey. 

Rick	Hey! Hi. (laughs) 

Susan	What are you doing? 

Rick	Oh, I was just, uh… checking out my auctions. 

Susan	Oh, yeah? (gasps) Well, I bet I have something up for bid that you might be interested in. 

Rick	You do, huh? 

Susan	Oh, honey, yeah. You wanna come upstairs? Hmm? 

Rick	That wouldn’t be a bad idea. 

Susan	Mmm… well, why don’t you come along with me then? 

Rick	Mmm… 

Susan	(laughs) 

Rick	Let’s stop the bidding at a hundred. What do you say? (laughs) 

Susan	Mmm… (laughs) Ah…

Rick	Oh… (laughs) 

Susan	Oh… Oh… (gasps) (moans) Oh! 

Rick	(moans) 

Susan	(moans) Mmm… Oh! (moans) Oh! 

Rick	Oh! 

Susan	Oh! (moans) (sighs) (moans) 

Rick	So about three months ago…she began to get suspicious so I cut them all off. 

Detective Blake	Yeah? Did any of them take it hard when you tried to end it? 

Rick	No. No, they all knew I was married. It was gonna end some time anyway. You know. They were just doing it for fun. Casual fling. 

Detective Blake	“Fun?”

Rick	Yeah. 

Detective Blake	Well, evidently one of them may have taken it a little more seriously than you thought. 

Rick	I guess so. 

Detective Blake	(sighs) 

Rick	So what are you gonna do? 

Detective Blake	I don’t know. (laughs) I do know one thing. There’s only two things in this world that constantly perplex me. And that’s computers and women. 

Rick	Well… (laughs) I know where they all live. So, uh… why don’t you go question some of them? 

Detective Blake	No. Come on, Rick. Just because some girl slept with you doesn’t make her a murderer. 

Rick	Well, I mean at least we have a lead. 

Detective Blake	Look. Right now you’re the only suspect I’ve got, right? Now if you really think one of theses girls did it, then why don’t you jump on the bandwagon, do a little investigating yourself, huh?

Rick	Uh… (sighs) Okay. 

Detective Blake	Good. Good. All right. Now, I want you to call me if you find anything and I think I have just enough time to get happy hour at Anchor Inn. Oop… (sighs) Forgot my pen. 

Rick	I took his advice and started going over the list of women I was with in the last few months. It just seemed so absurd. (sighs) Okay… okay… okay… okay… Okay, who could it have been? Now, let’s see. Gail? Beth? Beth… 


Beth/Rick	(walla)

Rick	Beth worked at County Parks and Recreation. Her fantasy was to strip and make love at the top of Mount Pilot. A real nature girl. (laughs) (sighs) 

Beth	Yeah… (moans) Oh!

Rick	Oh!

Beth	(moans) Oh! (gasps) 

Rick	(moans)

Beth	(moans) (gasps) 

Rick	Oh…

Beth	(moans) Oh! 

Rick	(moans)

Beth	Oh!

Rick	Robin. “The Stranger.” Hey, Jenny. What are you doing here?

Jenny	Hi, Rick. I’m going to the mall. Did you want to come with me? 

Rick	No. No. Listen… listen. I think I know who the killer is. Come on up. I’ll show you, okay? Jenny, um… what I’m about to say to you is gonna paint a different picture of me to you. And… and I just want to say that I loved Susan very much and that what I did was wrong.

Jenny	What happened, Rick? 

Rick	I was having affairs with numerous women… (sighs) …on internet fantasy chat rooms. You’ve heard of that before, haven’t you?

Jenny	Of course. I have this friend, Lisa. She does it all the time. In fact, I went with her one time to meet one of the guys she met. It was at this old hotel. Some guy wanted to do it there in the bridal suite. 

Lisa	Now stay here.

Jenny	(laughs)

Lisa	(laughs)

Jenny	(laughs)

Rick	What a beautiful bride.

Lisa	Mmm… hello. (laughs) Mmm…

Rick	(walla) Mmm… 

Lisa	(gasps) (moans) (gasps) (gasps) Mmm… Oh! Oh! (moans) (moans) Mmm… Mmm… (gasps) 

Rick	Yeah…

Lisa	(moans) (moans) (gasps) (gasps) (moans) 

Rick	(gasps) 

Lisa	(moans) (gasps) (moans) Oh, yeah. Yeah… (moans) 

Rick	(gasps) 

Lisa	Yeah. Oh, yeah. (moans) (moans) (gasps) (gasps) Yeah… (moans) Oh… (moans) Oh, my god! Oh, yeah… 

Rick	(gasps)

Lisa	(moans)

Rick	Yes… yes… yes… 

Lisa	(moans) 

Rick	(moans) Oh…

Lisa	Yeah! 

Rick	(gasps) 

Jenny	And then he left almost as quickly as he appeared. 

Rick	What was the name of the hotel?

Jenny	The Braidwood Inn.

Rick	So you know then? 

Jenny	Yes. 

Rick	How come you didn’t tell Susan?

Jenny	Well, if you remember, my twin sister and I weren’t talking for a while. You and I were still close. 

Rick	(sighs) 

Jenny	I just didn’t see any reason to betray you. Besides, I thought it was kind of exciting. (laughs) So tell me about the affairs. 

Rick	I… I don’t wanna talk about this right now. I… I… I can’t believe you’re so comfortable with the fact that I cheated on Susan. 

Jenny	(sighs) We weren’t close, Rick. I loved my sister but I didn’t like her. We were two different people. And in a way I think she was responsible for you having those affairs. 

Rick	(sighs) 

Jenny	So tell me more about them. 

Rick	(laughs) Well, there was Cora. She was the wild one. She wanted to have sex with me in the house while Susan was still there. Shh…

Cora	(moans) 

Rick	(gasps)

Cora	Up.

Rick	(laughs)

Cora	(moans) (gasps) (gasps) (moans) 

Susan	Hey, honey! What are you up to up there? 

Rick	Uh… no… nothing. I’m just relaxing.

Susan	Why don’t you come on down? I’ll make you some lunch. 

Rick	Uh… no, honey. That’s okay. I already… I already had a snack! 

Susan	Okay. 

Rick	(moans)

Cora	(moans)

Rick	(gasps) (moans) 

Cora	(moans)

Rick	(moans) 

Cora	Oh… Oh! (moans) Oh! (moans) 

Rick	(moans) 

Cora	(moans) 

Susan	What’s all that pounding up there? 

Rick	Oh, um… there’s no… I’m just… I’m putting on my socks. 

Cora	(moans) (moans) 

Rick	(moans)

Cora	(moans) Oh! (moans) (moans) 

Rick	(moans) 

Cora	Oh! Oh! (gasps) (moans) 

Song Lyrics	All aboard!

Cora	(gasps) (moans) Oh! (gasps) 

Rick	(moans) 

Cora	(moans)

Rick	Uh…

Cora	(moans) Uh-huh… Oh! Oh! 

Rick	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. (moans)

Cora	(moans) (gasps) (moans)

Rick	(moans) Yes! Told you! I want it!

Cora	Oh!

Rick	Oh, yeah. 

Cora/Rick	(moans) 	

Cora	(gasps) 

Rick	(moans) (gasps) Come on. 

Cora	(moans) Yeah. (moans) Oh! Yeah! Oh!

Rick/Cora	Oh! Oh!  

Cora	Yeah… oh! Oh! (moans) 

Jenny	So… (sighs) Did you ever have any feelings besides lust for any of these women? 

Rick	Yeah, I did. There was just one. Her name was Desiree. (sighs) She made me want her so bad. 

Jenny	Tell me about her. 

Rick	Well, I was in my office one afternoon when she responded to one of my emails. And a few days later I received this mysterious package. She wanted me to come to her cabin but she didn’t want me to see her, so she enclosed this perfumed scarf to blindfold myself with. What the hell’s this? When I arrived, I had second thoughts about the affair. But curiosity drove me on. I went inside and put on the blindfold just like she requested. It didn’t take long before I knew something was happening. 

Jenny	(moans) (gasps) 

Rick	(moans) 

Jenny	(moans) 

Rick	(groans)

Jenny	(moans)

Rick	Oh… 

Jenny	(laughs) (moans) (gasps) Oh… Oh! 

Rick	Oh! (groans) 

Jenny	(moans) Oh! (gasps) (moans) (moans)

Rick	Oh!

Jenny	Oh!

Rick	Oh!

Jenny	Oh! 

Rick/Jenny	Oh! Oh! 

Jenny	(moans) Oh!

Rick	Oh! 

Jenny	(moans) 

Rick	(gasps) Oh… (moans) 

Jenny	(moans) Oh… 

Rick	I wish I could see you right now. (gasps) 

Jenny	(laughs) Not unless you leave your wife.

Rick	(gasps) I can’t. 

Jenny	Come on. 

Rick	And I was only with her that one time. And that was so magnificent. 

Jenny	(laughs) 

Rick	And I don’t even know what she looks like. 

Jenny	Too bad you didn’t go back. 

Rick	Who the hell can that be? What the hell are you doing here?

Detective Blake	(sighs) You know… I think I left my pen here again. It’s up in your office. Hope you don’t mind me coming by un-announced. 

Rick	No. I… I… I’ll go get it for you. 

Detective Blake	Oh… you don’t want me to come in? 

Rick	Since when do you ask me to come in? Come in! 

Detective Blake	(laughs) 

Rick	(sighs) 

Detective Blake	(sighs) You’re, uh… Susan’s sister Jenny, aren’t you? 

Jenny	That’s some great detective work. 

Detective Blake	Yeah… well, I saw your photo on the desk. What brings you here, Jenny?

Jenny	(laughs) Rick’s going through a very sensitive time right now and I’m helping him get through it. 

Detective Blake	Oh…

Rick	Here’s your pen.

Detective Blake	Thanks. 

Jenny	I’ve gotta go. Call me later, Rick. 

Detective Blake	(laughs) You wanna tell me about that?

Rick	What do you mean by that? She’s my sister-in-law. Can’t I have her over for lunch? 

Detective Blake	Well, not if she’s the main course. 

Rick	You know… where do you get off accusing me? 

Detective Blake	Well, I just call them as I see them, Rick. 

Rick	Look, I… (sighs) I know how it can look. But listen I draw the line when it comes to having sex with my sister-in-law. 

Detective Blake	(laughs) Let me tell you something. In my line of work, I learned that most people do cross that line sooner or later. 

Rick	Look… it… what… when are you gonna cut me some slack? Okay? Why don’t you go out there and try to find the real killer instead of harassing me all the time? 

Detective Blake	You know I’d love that, Rick. So why don’t you give me a little hand, huh? Maybe a name? Who do you think did it? 

Rick	Molly. Molly Warfield. I met her in some fantasy chat room. Of all the women that I was with, she was the only one who met Susan. 

Detective Blake	Wait a minute… wait a minute… You said you met her on the internet. How come she met your wife? 

Rick	Well, they met during our affair. 

Molly	Dominatrix Pizza. You come in thirty minutes or I’m free. 

Rick	Come on in. Molly was a nice Italian girl who loved the “pepperoni,” if you get my drift. 

Molly	So… where do you want it?

Rick	Right there’s just fine. 

Molly	(moans) Yeah. Say something. Oh, god… (moans) 

Rick	Oh… Oh!

Molly	Fucking harder. 

Rick	(moans) (moans) Oh… 

Molly	(moans) 

Rick	Oh…

Molly	You wanna go harder? 

Rick	Oh, yeah…

Molly	Harder? 

Rick	(moans) Oh! Oh! (moans) (moans) (gasps) Yeah! Oh… (moans)

Molly	(moans) Yeah, that’s it. Oh! Oh! 

Rick	Oh! Oh, God! 

Molly	Oh! (moans) 

Rick	(moans) 

Molly	(moans) 

Rick	(moans)

Molly	Oh, yeah. 

Rick	(moans) 

Molly	Oh, yeah. 

Rick	(moans) 

Molly	Work it. 

Rick	I’m there. 

Molly	Oh… (moans) Oh, yeah. Oh…  

Rick	(moans) 

Molly	(moans) 

Rick/Molly	(moans) (moans) (moans) 

Molly	Oh, yeah… oh, yeah.

Rick	Oh, yeah! 

Molly	(moans) Give it to me. 

Rick	Oh, yeah!

Molly	Don’t stop! Don’t stop! 

Rick	Oh! 

Molly	(moans) Yeah! 

Rick	Oh!

Molly	Yeah! 

Rick	Oh! 

Molly	(moans)

Rick/Molly	(moans) 

Detective Blake	Why do you think she’d…want to murder your wife? 

Rick	I don’t. 

Detective Blake	What do you mean you don’t? You just gave me her name. 

Rick	Well, you asked me for one! And besides, out of all the women I was with she was the only one that knew Susan. 

Detective Blake	(laughs) All right. I’ll check it out but I think you’re grasping straws here. I might be getting softer in my old age, Rick, but I think I’m beginning to believe you. I’m not sure about her murdering your wife. (sighs) I know there’s still something… something missing. 

Rick	Well, there is another one. I called her “The Stranger.” She didn’t want to know my name, where I lived or what I did for a living. But I had to cut it off because Susan began to get suspicious. 

The Stranger	That’s nice…

Rick	Listen, I gotta tell you something. (sighs) I can’t see you any more. 

The Stranger	Why not? 

Rick	My wife is beginning to suspect. 

The Stranger	(sighs) Then why don’t you leave her? 

Rick	I can’t leave my wife. I mean I love my wife. I’m not gonna leave my wife! 

The Stranger	Well, if you love her so much then why are you out here with me? 

Rick	I don’t know. I mean we’re just… a little fling. We’re having some fun, right? Look. I… I… I gotta go, okay? I’m sorry. Bye. 

The Stranger	Wait a minute! Nobody walks out on me! Stop! Rick! Look. I know who are and I know where you live. The famous internet millionaire who cheats on his wife! Fuck you. I’m… I’m taking this to the papers. 

Rick	Yeah? Well, you do what you want, okay? I really… I really don’t care. Okay? Just do whatever you want. 

The Stranger	Well, okay. I will then! 

Detective Blake	That’s about it, huh? 

Rick	As far as I know. 	

Detective Blake	I don’t know what good it’s gonna do me. Can’t find her without a name. 

Rick	Wait a second. I made a list of all the places that we met. Maybe there’s a connection. 

Detective Blake	Well, now you’re acting like a real cop. 

Rick	And may… maybe you can find a name. Yeah… hey, wait a second. Look. I wrote down her license plate number. 

Detective Blake	Yeah. I’ll run a check. Don’t worry. I’ll get a name. 

Rick	All right. (sighs) Thanks. 

Detective Blake	(sighs) Taylor! It’s Blake! 

Rick	Come in. 

Detective Blake	Hey. Got some photos for you. Look here. Why don’t you check these out? 

Rick	(sighs) 

Detective Blake	Okay. Anybody look familiar? 

Rick	No. Not at all. 

Detective Blake	Look again. Are you sure?

Rick	I’m positive. I mean the only girl that I didn’t see…

Detective Blake	(sighs) 

Rick	(cont’d) …was Desiree and that’s because I was blindfolded.

Detective Blake	All right, all right, all right… forget it. It was worth a shot. Any way, the license plate was registered to a Monica Tames. 

Rick	Monica Tames… Monica Tames…

Detective Blake	Yeah. 

Rick	Shit. Oh, you know… my wife’s sister Jenny had a friend named Monica Tames. 

Detective Blake	Yeah?

Rick	Yeah. 

Detective Blake	(laughs) I’m gonna go check it out. 

Rick	Okay. I… I gotta go, too. I… I’ll lock up the house. I’ll just talk to you later.

Detective Blake	All right. 

Rick	Blake! Wait! 

Detective Blake	What?

Rick	Check this out. I found this at the back door. From Desiree.

Detective Blake	What does it say? 

Rick	“Rick. Now that she’s dead, we don’t need this anymore.” 

Detective Blake	Looks like a confession to me. Where does this Desiree live, do you know?

Rick	I don’t know. We met at some rented cabin. 

Detective Blake	You think Monica and Desiree could be the same person? 

Rick	No, no, no. Even blindfolded, I can tell the difference between the two women. 

Detective Blake	(laughs) Well, either way I’m still gonna pick up Monica Tames. Put her ass in the “hot seat.” You get on the internet and find Desiree, huh? 

Rick	Okay. Jenny? What are you doing here? Come on. Blake and I know who the murderer is. 

Jenny	Really?

Rick	Yeah. Come here. It was Desiree. 

Jenny	Your secret love?

Rick	(laughs) Yeah. She left me a note and a package and said she did it. She’s crazy. 

Jenny	Maybe she’s not crazy. Maybe she’s in love. 

Rick	“In love?” What are you talking about? I was with her one night! 

Jenny	Maybe it was more times than that. Maybe you don’t remember how much you said you wanted her. 

Rick	What are you talking about? 

Jenny	Maybe she killed Susan so she could give you what you wanted? (gasps) 

Rick	You’re Desiree. 

Jenny	(sighs) I’m more than that. 

Rick	How can you kill your own sister? 

Jenny	(sighs) Wives kill husbands. Husbands kill wives. I hated my sister. She had something that I wanted! (gasps) You. 

Rick	I’m calling the cops. 

Jenny	(groans) Why? (laughs) We could have a good life together, Rick. I could make your life more exciting than you ever dreamed of. We could share partners any way you wanted. I could help fulfill every fantasy you ever had. 

Rick	You’re sick, you know that? (gasps) You’re really sick. You killed your sister--my wife--and now you expect me to fall right into your arms? Well, it ain’t gonna happen, baby. It just ain’t gonna happen! 

Jenny	Ah! 

Rick	(groans)

Jenny	(grunts) No! Oh! 

Detective Blake	(sighs) I forgot my pen again. 

Rick	(sighs) 


(THE END)
