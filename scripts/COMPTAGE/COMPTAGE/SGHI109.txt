(SHE’S GOTTA HAVE IT)
("#CHANGEGONCOME (Gentrification)")
(Episode #109)





NOLA	Truth be told, Twenty-Sixteen (2016) was just a fucked up year. And the bogus election was the biggest fuck up of all time. 2016, you bitch, you robbed us of Muhammad Ali, Prince, David Bowie, Maurice White, Rod Temperton, Leonard Cohen, Natalie Cole, George Martin, Phife Dawg, Harper Lee, Bill “Radio Raheem” Nunn, Afeni Shakur, and too many more to mention in this moment of time and space. God bless. 2016 you motherfucker. Well, you did make me reflect on the noble folks who have inspired me and today, I pay homage and give thanks to them. And closing, this pilgrimage has me thinking about my own transition. I might get cremated, my gray ashes spread over my beloved Fort Greene Park. I love you all dearly, except D.T.
 
BIANCA TATE	Settle down, okay. Alright, I appreciate all of you coming out tonight, I do. Thank you. There is one final Order of Business. So as you may know, some Heartless Thug has been defacing our Homes and our Businesses with a Large Green G.

STOKLEY	For Gentrification. Don’t leave that part out!

MAX	Graffiti was here before us. It’ll be here after we’re gone!

PAPO	Say word!

BIANCA TATE	Mr. Max. Are you suggesting we just accept the defacement of our Brownstones?

MAX	No I'm saying we have bigger Fish to Fry. Like why have they kicked all of the Black and Brown Men out of Fort Greene Park simply for playing Soccer?!

BIANCA TATE	There were noise complaints. However, right now, we are talking about Vandalism. And it is clear who the culprit is.

AUDIANCE	Who?

BIANCA TATE	Papo.

PAPO	Nah, you got that wrong, okay. You got the wrong Dominican.

NOLA	Bianca, really? Come on.

SEPTIMA	No, leave the man alone.
 
BIANCA TATE	No, he clearly has an agenda to scare the Newer Neighbors in Fort Greene!

STOKLEY	Papo is a part of this Community.

MAX	He’s the Mayor of our Block!

BIANCA TATE	He’s not MY Mayor. I did not Vote for Papo! The Man is a Mental Case!

NOLA	You’re right, Bianca! Papo does have Mental Issues. He’s seen all kinds of horrible things in Afghanistan defending The Red, White and Blue for everyone here, in Bk and in The US of A!

BIANCE TATE	Alright calm down. I hear you Nola and I respect anyone who serves. But the Man is a Vagrant.

RACHEL	No, he is an Artist!

PAPO	(Spanish) Un artista!

RACHEL	Have you even seen his Work?

BIANCA TATE	No, I haven't seen his work, but I have smelled the Mess he’s made out of my garbage!

SHELLY	He does leave quite a Mess.

DOUG	We paid a lot to have our vestibule renovated and to see it covered in trash...
 
PAPO	Oh The Terror! The Trashy Mess! Children starving The World over. Patriarchy staining Young Minds and Vaginas! The FBI classifies Black Lives Matter as a Hate Group.

RACHEL	Black Lives Matter.

BIANCA TATE	White Lives ...

EVERYONE	Black lives matter / All lives matter...

STOKLEY	Can I say something?

SEPTIMA	Stokes, please. I, for one, did not come here to gang up on Miss Tate.

BIANCA TATE	Thank you.

SEPTIMA	Sure her Designer Panties are Tightly bound!

PAPO	That's no secret.

SEPTIMA	But, it's our differences that make Fort Greene great. The new Folks, you gonna keep on coming. And the Old Heads, well we ain't going nowhere!

MAN	That's right.

SEPTIMA	That's right.

STOKLEY	You got that right.

SEPTIMA	But we have to, excuse me... We have got to find a way to make it work. We should have a Pot Luck dinner and we should use the day to get to know each other better. What do you say?
 
STOKLEY	I have a question. I have a question. I want to have a question.

BIANCA TATE	Yes, Mister Darling, the floor is yours

STOKLEY	This would be the last thing I’m gonna say.

NOLA	Thank you, Jesus.

STOKLEY	“To be or not to be, That is the motherfucking question.”

NOLA	Most of the people I grew up with moved away after College. And who can blame them? You go away to get a Degree, only to Come home and pay Three times the Rent?

DR. JAMISON	Yet you’ve vigilantly remained.

NOLA	Brooklyn’s Home. I’m ain't leaving. No matter how much it changes or how Broke I get.

DR. JAMISON	Being Broke. That Ain’t No Joke. What I meant to say is that you are carrying a lot on your shoulders; your financial struggles, your friend Shemekka...

NOLA	She’s doing a lot better.

DR. JAMISON	God bless. But what about you? You had that tough review.
 
NOLA	I’m Okay. Okay, I'm Fine. But it isn't just the Review. My whole Art Life is just in struggle mode. I’m creating all the time. But I can't help wondering if I’m ever gonna make it as an Artist or if I'm just gonna end up like Papo. He's my friend. He was an Afghan war vet, Damn Good Artist in High School but just couldn’t survive the changes.

DR. JAMISON	That’s an understandable fear. Would you feel more secure if you didn’t have to juggle your Art Aspirations and your many Relationships?

NOLA	You say that like you think they’re a distraction.

DR. JAMISON	But can you focus with Three Boyfriends?

NOLA	They’re not my Boyfriends.

DR. JAMISON	I’m sorry, I'm sorry, lovers. In addition to Opal. That’s four.

NOLA	I admit I may have slipped up and called one by the other’s name but I never confuse their Energies.

DR. JAMISON	Is their Energy feeding your voice as an Artist?

NOLA	They all bring something different out of me.

DR. JAMISON	Tell me about that.

NOLA	Mars makes me laugh until my Sides hurt. We just have Fun together, ya know? He makes me feel like a Kid again.

DR. JAMISON	And Greer?
 
NOLA	Greer is spontaneous, surprisingly Cultured. Nothing is ever the same with him. Definitely not the Sex.

DR. JAMISON	And Jamie?

NOLA	It’s a little more... intricate.

DR. JAMISON	Of course, of course. The estranged Wife.

NOLA	It was convenient at first. Him taking my Broke Ass to the River Cafe? Buying my Art when no one else would? But then, something shifted. I care about him and he cares about me in a way that no one ever has.

DR. JAMISON	Not even your Parents?

NOLA	Jamie’s Grown. I like that Energy. He’s a very nurturing Parent.

DR. JAMISON	A father figure.

NOLA	Same thing with Opal. She’s the kind of Woman I aspire to be.

DR. JAMISON	Well you’ll get there, in your own time. It sounds like all together your Lovers make the Perfect Mate.

NOLA	But you don’t think that’s Smart.

DR. JAMISON	I didn’t say that.

NOLA	I got it all under wraps Doc Jamison. For one, Opal’s not even a problem. I never see anyone more than Twice a Week. No Two Lovers in one day. No Sex without a Condom. And no Sex if it ain’t in my Lovin’ Bed.
 
DR. JAMISON	You’ve got a lot of rules there.

NOLA	Got to maintain some kind of control.

DR. JAMISON	Or what? Let’s go back to your Art Opening.

NOLA	Do we have to? That was like weeks ago.

DR. JAMISON	I know, I know. And I know that it was tough but I think that it’s a great opportunity for us to examine your ability to maintain control.

NOLA	Or lack thereof.

DR. JAMISON	How did it feel having all your Lovers in one Space?

NOLA	Bananas! Like I was putting out a lot of Fires.

DR. JAMISON	And what would have happened if you just let the Fires burn?

NOLA	I couldn’t do that.

DR. JAMISON	But this was your big Night. And instead of being present for your Art...

NOLA	...I chose to put out the Fires. Fuck.

DR. JAMISON	Don’t beat up on yourself. Nola. You are a Vibrant, black and Beautiful Young Female Artist. You should be enjoying your Life.

NOLA	But isn’t it time I grew up? You know responsibilities and Shit? I mean Saturn's Return means I could be making major decisions that could impact the rest of my life, who I end up with, and I’m over here putting out Fires?
 
DR. JAMISON	I don’t want you to feel pressured to choose but the Reality is that each Lover will most likely want more of your Time and heart and soul. But what will you have left for yourself? For your Art? Can I make a suggestion? Opal, was always very transparent with you. Maybe it’s time to take a page out of her Book. Maybe full disclosure will help lift this burden that you've been carrying, help you steer clear of making your male Lovers a Three-Headed Monster.

NOLA	A Three-Headed Monster...

DR. JAMISON	If the truth hurts, so be it.

SHEMEKKA	Give me a big slide, my super-girl. Oh goodness, when did you get so big? You know I love you more than anything, right?

NADIA	Yeah.

SHEMEKKA	I love you Nadia.

NADIA	I love you too, mommy.

SHEMEKKA	Mmhh, give me a kiss. Ready to play again?

NADIA	Yes.

SHEMEKKA	Okay. Let's go.
 
NOLA	Mekkaaaaaa!

SHEMEKKA	What’s good, killer?

NOLA	Painting, no Boys today, it’s all about this work.

SHEMEKKA	Good for you.

NOLA	How you feeling?

SHEMEKKA	Grinding. Trying to get some bills paid. Oh, if a Lady named Carmelita gives you a call, I was your Assistant for like a year. I was very polite, always on time and mad stylish.

NOLA	I’m just glad you’re… You know, I'm glad.

SHEMEKKA	Come on, Nola, man. Don’t get all emo on me again!

NOLA	We almost lost you! I can’t be happy that my hustling ass friend is back from the dead?

SHEMEKKA	Don’t say Ass. No but Seriously, You know I’m the bounce back Queen! I gotta a baby to raise. So if that Lady calls, Hook It Up. I need this shmoney. Bad.

NOLA	You know they're hiring Lunch Staff over at Tubman, right?

SHEMEKKA	Bitch, Harriet Tubman ain’t free us to be slinging no Sloppy Joes to no bad ass kids! Harriet ain’t want that for me.
 
NOLA	Hello? You still there?

CASH	Black girl booty pageant. Black girl booty pageant. Black girl booty pageant.

SHEMEKKA	Yeah. Let me give you a call right back.

NOLA	Alright.

CASH	Season three is about to come, you are invited to compete. Get your booty competition on.

SHEMEKKA	Yo, Kanie, turn that shit off.

NOLA	Romare Bearden is The Collagist of our day, and he's a Black Man, how cool is that? This piece is called ‘Young Students’ and it depicts a Street Scene. So today, we’re going to make our own Collages that show what our own Neighborhoods look and feel like. You've cut out the things you like, now let's start to arrange them in a creative way. Let's get to work. Reggie are you on your phone?

REGGIE	But Ms. Darling...

NOLA	... You know I do not allow phones in my class...

REGGIE	...But, Ms. Darling, it's you!

NOLA	What?

HASSAN	That's really you? Shit.

KIDS	Oooooh.

REGGIE	Shut up. Can’t you see she's already shook?!

KERVON	So you Famous now, Ms. Darling?

HASSAN	Ms. Darling, How many likes you got?

REGGIE	Two-Thousand (2000)!

HASSAN	Damn, yo!

NOLA	Really, Clo? Really?!

CLORINDA	I’m sorry, Tatiana. Do you mind just giving us one second? Thank you so much, thank you. Do we have a problem?

CLORINDA	I’ve known Nola Darling for quite some time but once I saw her powerful Campaign for My Name Isn’t, I knew this Street Artist would be the Art World’s next Force of Nature.

CLORINDA	You’re welcome?

NOLA	I didn’t want this out there.


CLORINDA	Really? 'Cause that Post got over Fifty-Thousand (50,000) views. Do you know how many times I’ve seen My Name Isn’t as a Hashtag?
 
NOLA	That’s not the fucking point.

CLORINDA	Well then what is the point?

NOLA	Look, I didn't... who told you?

CLORINDA	Who do you think? Mars. When he was concerned about how Broke you’ve been. And I’m trying to understand why you’re so mad right now.

NOLA	‘Street Artist’?

CLORINDA	Did I lie?

NOLA	It’s One Series of Fucking Work. It came out of my Assault. It's not who I am!

CLORINDA	Okay, well who else would know this other than me, your Parents and the Folks that were here for the Group show? You’re a Real Talent, it's just time for you to shine.

NOLA	Not like this.

CLORINDA	Well then how?Like it or not, adversity serves you. Brings out the best of you and THIS is your best Work yet! I just don’t know why you kept this from me for so long. I mean it’s so Bold and Fierce and Unapologetically Feminist and Fearlessly Anti-Mysoganist! I mean this should’ve been at The Group Show!

NOLA	That’s not for you to decide.

CLORINDA	Thanks to that Post, several people are interested. I mean there's been a lot of inquiries in the last hour alone. And one Celebrity Client who I can't really reveal his identity. But let’s just say his name rhymes with SHMEnny SHMABitZ! Okay?! You're not happy.
 
NOLA	No, I’m not.

CLORINDA	I just helped you launch your Career in a Big Way. Most Artists would kill for that kind of exposure and all you’re giving me is an attitude!

NOLA	Because you never asked me, Clo!

CLORINDA	Like you did with Mars?

NOLA	Are you fucking kidding me? How many times are you gonna bringing that up? What, did you wanna share?

CLORINDA	Forget it, I did this because this was the Boost that you needed.

NOLA	Well you don’t know everything, Clorinda Bradford.

CLORINDA	No but I know more than you about how this Art World works, Ms. Darling.

NOLA	Word. You know me more than me? Did you know I’m about to walk the Fuck out of The New Medina Gallery right now?

CLORINDA	Nola, Nola. Okay, what? So you're just gonna hide! Like some scared Little Girl?! Nola, who do you think helped put this red dot on the wall?

NOLA	Good luck with that.
 
MARS	You alright?

NOLA	Why? Are you gonna RESCUE me again?

MARS	What’s up, Ma? I get off in a few, we could...

NOLA	If I knew I couldn’t confide one bit of information to you, I would have never...

MARS	...Woah Woah what are we talking about here?

NOLA	My Street Campaign, Mars. I asked you NOT to tell anyone about it.

MARS	Aw Shit. Clo? I can explain!

NOLA	I’m listening.

MARS	First of all my Bad but my intentions were 24 Karat! Me and Clo, we just wanted to help you with your Art & Commerce thing.

NOLA	I never asked for your help! I asked you to keep it between us but, maybe...

MARS	Maybe? Maybe what?

NOLA	I care about you. And I know you care about me, but maybe it’s time we grow up, Mr. Childs.

MARS	Mr. Childs? What the Fuck does that mean?
 
NOLA	Fuck.

MARS	Yeah, I’m younger than you but I ain’t no Child!

NOLA	No, it's just... It's my Saturn Return...

MARS	No, no stop. Saturn return? What the... Just, fuck Saturn! I’m Mars and I’m here! I ain’t been Ride or Die from Jump? I ain’t had ya back?!

NOLA	Yeah, you have but...

MARS	Nola, don't. By gones. Let me get my Bike! Let's ride from this present Fuckery into a Brooklyn Sunset Bliss with you on the Handle Bars, swingin’ ya Cocoa Legs, wind blowing in your Shea Butter Kinks. Get Sodie pop, Artesinal Popcorn then head back to your spot, have Hot Make Up Sex!

NOLA	No. I got work to do.

MARS	But Nola...

NOLA	Just let it go, Mars. It’s was Fun, right? It was fun.

MARS	Please Mamí? ¡POR FAVOR!

PAPO	No Buenos Dias?

BIANCA TATE	This is my home. This is my property, and then you're gonna come here and spray stuff on it?

PAPO	What you...
 
BIANCA TATE	I don't come and paint on your home or whatever that is.

PAPO	No, I make the neighborhood beautiful, I don't know what you're talking about.

BIANCA TATE	I'm sick of this, alright? Alright I'm calling the cops, that's it.

PAPO	What you calling the cops for?

BIANCA TATE	What do you think I'm calling the cops for?

PAPO	There's nothing happening in the block.

PAPO	Really?

BIANCA TATE	Don't even “really” with me.

PAPO	I can't believe. I really can't believe you actually...

BIANCA TATE	Look, what else am I supposed to do?

PAPO	I can't believe you did that.

BIANCA TATE	No, everyday I open my door and you're here. It's two in the moring, can't even sleep because I'm listening to your music.

PAPO	Where am I supposed to go? Where am I supposed to go? I was born and raised here, alright? This is my block, this is where I've been all my life. Where am I supposed to go?
 
BIANCA TATE	And you are playing your music, and then you just deface...

PAPO	If it's not the music...

NOLA	What's going on?

MARS	Yo, all jokes aside, if you need more space...

PAPO	And I can't believe you actually did call the cops.

BIANCA TATE	It's not supposed to be on my stoop, I know that.

NOLA	No, Mars, I...

PAPO	You actually called the cops. I can't believe you went there.

BIANCA TATE	You left me no choice.

OFFICER BRINKLEY	What’s the problem?

NOLA	Thank you.

OPAL	Of course. Not sure why you called me and not one of your guys.

NOLA	So they could think they were saving a damsel in distress? I’m good.

OPAL	What you did was Noble. Luckily you walk away with a desk appearance ticket. But Nola, you could’ve really gotten Hurt. Or Worse.

NOLA	You’re right. I'm sure I'm gonna hear all about it on myway home.

OPAL	Oh no. I think they’d prefer to take you Home.

STOKLEY	Nola.

NOLA	Daddy!
 
JAMIE	Grat day to make some money gentlemen. Good morning Daisy.

DAISY	Good morning. Morning. Hey.

NOLA	Jamie. I’m so grateful for meeting you on The Promenade that day. Who knows why The Universe brings People together. Maybe it's to share these exchanges of Light. Illumination to better see ourselves. I don’t know. But you’ve been so supportive. You’ve taught me that People really can give from a genuine place. But what I need most right now is understanding. If I’m going to make it, I need to know that the Greatest Lift is one I can give myself. And I have to Trust that the Universe gives us Signals that we're on the right Path.

NOLA	Oh, my goodness. God is Great. I got The Grant. I Got The Catlett Grant. Something is happening Jamie. And you're right. To be perfectly honest, there IS someone else, Me.
