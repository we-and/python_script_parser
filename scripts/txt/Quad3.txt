CARLTON	Share what you know about life at a historically black college.

CEDRIC	What about my music?

BERETTA	They got music in Atlanta.

COACH HARDWICK	You ready to wear that burgundy and black?

DANNY	You a Mountain Cat?

NONI	No.

SYDNEY	I shouldn't have to go with you.

COP	Cedric Hobbs, you're under arrest for the murder of Chantel Brussard.

MAN	Some pussies think they ready to be Mountain Cats.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Welcome to the terror dome, bitch.

EVA	I will not hesitate to put my foot directly in your ass.

WOMAN	Hey!

BOTH	Oh.

JUNIOR	Ooh, why she blowing you up? Bo? Bo?

BOJOHN	Mm.

JUNIOR	Hey, so we at the yard, dog.

COP	Watch your step.

JUNIOR	Hey, they got Ced. Yo, what my man do?

WOMAN	Hope he don't chokehold himself in the backseat.

COP		Me too. I know I'd feel terrible.

CEDRIC	Youyou get my moms?

BRYCE	She's not answering.

CEDRIC	Hey, leave a message, but keep calling, man. Keep calling.

COP	Everybody, back up, please.

MAN	Man, y'all act like he killed somebody.

WOMAN	He probably did.

BRYCE	He didn't kill anybody.

STUDENTS	Oh, damn, man. Why?

MAN	Hey, get your hands off of him!

COP	Watch your head.

WOMAN	Oh, my god. Did you see what happened? Damn.

MADISON	What are they all waiting for?

SYDNEY	Queen Eva, of course.

REPORTERS	Dr. Fletcher! Dr. Fletcher!

REPORTER	Dr. Fletcher, was the victim a student at GAMU?

REPORTER	Dr. Fletcher, what do you have to say to the victim's family?

EVA	We're praying for them and we are very sorry for the loss of their daughter, Chantel. My daughter is my life, and I don't know what I'd do if I lost her. I really feel for them. We all do.

REPORTER	Dr. Fletcher, did the school conduct a background check on Cedric Hobbs?

EVA	The university is not in the habit of performing background checks on students seeking higher education.

REPORTER	So you are openly defending a murderer?

EVA	Alleged.

EVA	Unless the judicial system has changed in the last ten minutes, Cedric Hobbs is innocent until proven guilty. He is a member of the Georgia A&M family, and we will support him as such. This is what happens when a young person chooses this school. We choose them right back.

COP	Open 2-4.

COP	Log with evidence.

COP	Turn to your right.

COP	Turn to your left.

COP	Face forward. Going again.

COP	Face forward again.

CARLTON	Like the morning, huh?

EVA	Yes.

CARLTON	It's gonna take a lot of work to convince donors you're not admitting a freshman class criminal.

EVA	Well, small-minded people will always jump to conclusions without facts.

CARLTON	Still, you've got your work cut out for you.

EVA	Given that truth, shall we speed along to the point of your visit?

CARLTON	Courtesy...and an opportunity: that's what this meeting is. You look as disappointed as I am. This whole scandalous mess gotta go away...for your daughter's sake.

EVA	Sydney. My daughter you're attempting to use as a pawn, her name is Sydney.

CARLTON	Like the capital of Australia. Or maybe it'sIs it Melbourne?

EVA	The capital of Australia is Canberra.

CARLTON	(snaps fingers) You're right. It used to be Melbourne, though.

EVA	We're not talking about what was. We're discussing what is. This is 2017, Carlton. Women have sex on video and become billionaires. There are reality shows about naked people dating every other week.

CARLTON	We don't live our lives on TV.

EVA	You want my job? Take an honest run at it. Oh, wait. You already did.

EVA	And I was hired. If you don't mind, I'll take this opportunity to visit the ladies' room. 

JUNIOR	Hey, yo, Bo. Alyssa's blowing up my phone and she said call her back right now or else.

TAVARUS	Yo, I know you didn't give your woman his number.

MAN	That's a bitch move.

BOJOHN	Man, I did not, all right? She copied my contacts. My bad. I'll handle it, all right?

TAVARUS	Yo! What happened to the water?

MAN	What the hell, man?

MAN	Shut up, man. What happened?

MAN	Yo, what happened to the water? For real.

EVA	You have got to be kidding me.

CRYSTAL	Dr. Fletcher?

EVA	I know. The question is, why? I negotiated an extension with the Department of Water, so please tell me why.

CRYSTAL	Maybe they feel like they've given us plenty of

EVA	That was a rhetorical question, Crystal.

CRYSTAL	I can send a campus-wide email alert letting everyone know that a major pipe broke and our water had to be shut off for the repair. Gives you a couple of hours to come up with a solution.

EVA	Why didn't I think of that?

CRYSTAL	That was rhetorical too, right? 

EVA	Mm.

CRYSTAL	I'll get that email out.

BRYCE	Dad.

MAN	Roll, man.

CHARLES	You all right, son?

BRYCE	They arrested Cedric. I left you two messages.

CHARLES	I was in court. Docket just cleared. (sighs)

BRYCE	He didn't do it, Dad.

CHARLES	Yeah, you say that in both of your messages. Look. You don't know what happened. You weren't there.

BRYCE	I was there.

CHARLES	No, listen to me, son. Other than sharing this room, you and Cedric have nothing in common. And you can't get mixed up in some thug's murder case.

BRYCE	He's not a thug!

CHARLES	I know you want to help this boy. That's what's gonna make you a damn good lawyer.

BRYCE	You lost me.

CHARLES	Richardson and Associates. Your name is on the front of a building. And the only thing Cedric's name will ever be on is a rap sheet.

BRYCE	How can you say that?

CHARLES	How can I say what? That you're better than this kid? Because you are.

BRYCE	Wow. Okay. You know, it's surprising to hear you say that since you were the one who taught me that a good lawyer defends those who can't defend themselves. But a great lawyer stands up against all in the name of justice. Dad, I'm standing up for Cedric. He didn't do this, and he deserves help to prove it.

KARA	Hello?

EVA	Kara, how are you?

KARA	I'm well. What a surprise to hear from you.

EVA	Oh, well... (laughing) I was thinking about the Katz Eldercare dinner we co-chaired.

KARA	It was a good event for a worthy cause. So how's the new gig?

EVA	It's amazing. It has its challenges, but I get to do life-affirming work and Georgia A&M gets the most successful fundraising president in Farnsworth's history.

KARA	Eva, so let's not do this. Everyone knows you accepted that position because you were forced to resign from Laura Farnsworth.

EVA	I, uh... II'm sorry, Kara. I'd love to clear up any misunderstandings, but the terms of my exit are confidential.

KARA	Confidentiality is a luxury you're not afforded when you're the married college president caught screwing one of her students.

EVA	Bitch.

COACH HARDWICK	Hey. Um... I've got a possible donor, a wealthy alum, sits on the 50-yard line every game, win or lose.

EVA	Great. Great. Let's reach out to him. How does the water get turned off at an entire university?

LAMAR	Dr. Fletcher. Oh, hey, what's up, Coach? Good news: my financial aid came in.

EVA	I told you you weren't going home.

LAMAR	And I heard you told the financial aid office too. Fire Next Time.

EVA	Fire Next Time.

LAMAR	(laughs) See you.

EVA	(laughs) Huh.

INMATE	(singing) Happy birthday to me.

INMATE	Hey, shut up!

INMATE	Man, let him enjoy his birthday!

INMATE	Man, shut up!

INMATE	Don't nobody care about your birthday.

INMATE	(singing) Happy birthday to me.

INMATE	Yo, dog, shut up.

INMATE	(singing) Happy birthday to me.

INMATE	I'ma come down there and break your head, boy.

INMATE	(singing) Happy birthday to me.

BERETTA	Work it, baby. Work that birthday dance. It's your birthday. Whose birthday is it?

CEDRIC	It's my birthday.

BERETTA	Yeah, that's right. Did you forget?

BERETTA	(laughing) It's ready. Whew! Ooh! Birthday boy, you are going to love this. Just a little more icing.

CEDRIC	(laughs)

BERETTA	Not funny. (laughs) Okay. (singing) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. (talking) Ready? Now.

BERETTA	Get down! Get down now!

MAN	Somebody call 911!

BERETTA	Okay.

CEDRIC	Mama, are you okay?

BERETTA	It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. Just somebody out there acting like a fool, that's all. Okay? Just stay right here. I got you. Okay. See? That right there. This is why I make you come straight home after school; why we don't go outside after dark. You understand?

CEDRIC	Yeah, but

BERETTA	But nothing. You are so smart. In kindergarten, you were doing crossword puzzles when other kids could barely read. You can do math in your head faster than I can on a calculator. That's why I can't let these streets get you. You will never see the inside of a jail.

SYDNEY	So is Ryan still coming for the weekend?

MADISON	Yes, ma'am. Finally.

SYDNEY	How'd you convince him? Promise him a little something, something?

MADISON	Uh, Sydney. 

MADISON	Oh, don't.

MADISON	No. Eww. (laughs)

SYDNEY	You better service that man if you want to keep him.

MADISON	And who says I don't?

SYDNEY	Mm.

MADISON	I just don't want to talk about it.

SYDNEY	(sighs) You want to Uber to Lennox Mall, shop for some new pieces after I get out of class? My treat.

MADISON	I'm good.

SYDNEY	Can you just let me do this for you?

MADISON	Really. Look. I don't need anything.

SYDNEY	Trust me. You do. (smooches)

COP	All right, stop right here. Stay still.

MAN	Hey.

MAN	Yo, what's up?

CEDRIC	How you doing, sir? Thank you for coming, Mr. Richardson. You tell me what to do, and I'll do it. I'm about to lose it in here. I still haven't talked to my mother or a lawyer yet. They keep telling me that I'ma see some public defender in court, but I thought you couldn't do that, keep me in here without letting me see a lawyer

CHARLES	Son.

CEDRIC	I'm sorry. I'm kind of bugging out.

CHARLES	I understand. But I'm not sure you understand. Do you remember when you moved into the dorm? As soon as you met Bryce, you called him a Blue Blood. You remember that?

CEDRIC	Yeah, I still call him that. But I don't mean nothing by it. Bryce is my boy.

CHARLES	Look, I know you didn't mean it as an insult. But the Richardsons are blue bloods. Bryce and his brother were third generation Georgia A&M. One day, they will have sons who will be the fourth generation Richardsons to become Mountain Cats.

CEDRIC	No disrespect. I'm just trying to figure out how what you saying relates to my situation.

CHARLES	Do you have a father, Cedric?

CEDRIC	Everybody got a father. Mine died when I was three. But I still got one.

CHARLES	Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. But as a parent, a father, you have one job: protect your children. And for me, that's my two sons.

CEDRIC	Well, you should be happy, 'cause Bryce got no problems.

CHARLES	No, he doesn't. And I can't allow him to risk his future by getting involved with yours.

CEDRIC	Mr. Richardson, I didn't do this. My girl was killed. I can't even feel how I need to feel because I'm in here. And now you about to tell me you not gonna help me.

CHARLES	One way or another, you would end up right where you are. But Bryce has got a lot ahead of him.

CEDRIC	So do I! I'm a good dude. Come on. What if it was Bryce? What if y'all weren't so royal? I mean, wouldn't you want somebody to help him?

CHARLES	You are not my son. You understand?

CEDRIC	(sighs) (chuckles) You ain't shit. You understand that?

CHARLES	Just as I expected.

CHARLES	Hey! Enough!

COP	I got him. I got him. You're gone.

COACH HARDWICK	Yesterday in your officenow, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop. But you were on a call. It seemed pretty bad.

EVA	I was fine.

COACH HARDWICK	You hung up and called somebody a bitch.

EVA	(snorts) You don't want to hear stories about all the mistakes I've made.

SYDNEY	(sighs) (groans) Hi, Mother.

EVA	Hello, Sydney. Your dad's coming to visit this weekend.

SYDNEY	I know. He didn't tell me he was seeing you too.

EVA	We're still family.

SYDNEY	(chuckles) That's right. All wives live 1,000 miles from their husbands.

EVA	You are not going to ruin my day.

SYDNEY	Bye.

EVA	Good-bye. And before you ask, no, I am not always that short with my daughter.

COACH HARDWICK	Since we're all family... You know, when my wife left, I didn't know how I was gonna make it on my own with my girls, how I was gonna do their hair and dating. I couldn't even think about bringing another woman around. How was a football coach gonna raise these girls and make sure they'd grow up and, you know, don't become locker room talk.

EVA	Excuse me. Did you just say you had daughters?

COACH HARDWICK	Courtney is 9; Jade's 11. Well, 11 going on 35. (laughs) Yeah, I don't really talk about them much because they're everything to me. Now, I don't like to share that with just anybody.

EVA	I respect that.

COACH HARDWICK	Yeah, me and my girls are making it work. Hell, I even know how to braid hair.

EVA	(laughing) Are you serious?

COACH HARDWICK	Very. Box braids, cornrowsLook. I get it in.

COACH HARDWICK	Oh, and my nine-year-old, oh, poor baby girl. Oh, tender-headed.

EVA	So was Sydney. We used to go back and forth with the comb. (laughs)

COACH HARDWICK	How'd you get through it?

EVA	I hired a braider. Oh, yeah. She came every three weeks like clockwork. She is just so hard to figure out. Every time I feel like I can take a breath, she does something else stupid. And it never bothers her. She had alcohol poisoning a few days ago. She was sleeping in my bed, sweet as could be. And today, the bitch is back. You'll know what I'm talking about one day.

COACH HARDWICK	Oh, no, I won't. No. (chuckles) 

COACH HARDWICK	You ready?

EVA	Let's get that money, Coach. What's this? Night club?

COACH HARDWICK	Uh, sorta.

EVA	What's "sorta"?


COACH HARDWICK	It's a gentlemen's club.

EVA	And what are we doing here?

COACH HARDWICK	Getting that money.

EVA	Excuse me?

COACH HARDWICK	The donor's a big football fan.

EVA	And he owns a strip club?

COACH HARDWICK	No. He owns a chain of them. He also owns a couple restaurants, bowling alley, carwashes.

EVA	Then why are we meeting here?

COACH HARDWICK	Oh, he's pretty proud of his seafood buffet. (laughing) Okay, all right, all right. No more jokes. Jeez! 

EVA	(clicks tongue) You're like that irritating brother you want to hit in the head with a 2x4 and watch bleed out.

COACH HARDWICK	That ain't funny.

EVA	Oh, the optics on this are really bad.

COACH HARDWICK	You write a personal check to get the school's water turned back on, and you worried about optics?

WOMAN	All right.

MAN	Keep the drinks coming.

COACH HARDWICK	That's him.

DOMINIQUE	Well, now. Forgot to mention the part about her being so beautiful. Good god.

COACH HARDWICK	What's up, brother?

DOMINIQUE	What's up, man?

COACH HARDWICK	What's up, brother?

DOMINIQUE	You all right?

COACH HARDWICK	Sure, sure.

DOMINIQUE	Dominique Briggs.

EVA	Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Briggs.

DOMINIQUE	Pleasure's all mine, Madam what do I call you, Madam President, Madam Doctor, Mrs. Fletcher, Miss Fletcher, hopefully?

EVA	Eva is fine.

DOMINIQUE	Yes, she is. Let's have a seat. Eva.

EVA	You, um, seem to be missing your poles.

DOMINIQUE	Not missing. They're in the VIP room.

DOMINIQUE	How's this?

EVA	Do you have an office where we can conduct a proper meeting?

DOMINIQUE	Trying to tell me you never been in a gentlemen's club before?

EVA	Not during daylight.

DOMINIQUE	So, you know, I been doing all right for a while now. No one from GAMU's ever come calling. My guess, uptight assholes think they're too good for my money.

COACH HARDWICK	Good guess.

DOMINIQUE	Us black folks, man. Rather be indebted to white banks than accept a black man's legally earned money.

EVA	Well, I can't speak for previous administrations, but I appreciate you for considering giving back to your alma mater.

DOMINIQUE	Talk to me. What do you need?

EVA	Enough to name a building after you would be a good start.

DOMINIQUE	I tell you what. Why don't you come over here, put your hand in my pocket; whatever you pull out is yours.

COACH HARDWICK	Come on, man. Really? See you at the game next week.

EVA	Perhaps the previous administration had a point.

DOMINIQUE	Hey, y'all want my money; my sense of humor comes along with it. Why don't you come back when you can appreciate both? Crank it up, babe. Ain't a damn funeral home.

DAN	Cedric, you're gonna have to

CEDRIC	I ain't taking no plea.

DAN	You have to trust me here. I've done this 1,000Okay? You're gonna have to trust me on this if

BERETTA	(laughs) Cedric.

CEDRIC	Mama.

BERETTA	Hi. You okay? (gasps) You're okay.

CEDRIC	I thought you wasn't gonna never get here. (sighs) Oh, look. I been thinking about Chantel. Maybe it wasn't her body they found. You know how she always be running off without telling anybody where she going.

BERETTA	Cedric.

CEDRIC	I think that's what she did. Tell her. They don't even have any pictures of whoever they found.

BERETTA	Baby, I spoke with Louise this morning. They identified the body. She was strangled. They think that's how she died, baby. They didn't even know she was in Atlanta.

CEDRIC	Yes, they did!

BERETTA	Hello, I'm Cedric's mother.

DAN	Dan Samuels. I'm Cedric's lawyer. It's nice to meet you. Hey, listen.

CEDRIC	Oh, don't listen. He talking about some nonsense about taking a plea.

DAN	Actually, I'm talking about you not spending the rest of your life in prison.

BERETTA	That's not gonna happen. Do you see why I didn't want you here, what can happen once they have you? (crying quietly) I'm gonna go, okay? Keep to yourself. Don't let anybody see you looking weak. We'll get you out of here, okay?

CEDRIC	Where you going?

BERETTA	I'm going home. I gotta get back. I can't afford to take any time off if I'm gonna have to pay for a real lawyer.

DAN	Ma'am, please. You don't have to insult me. We're on the same team.

BERETTA	You told him to take a damn plea so you could get his file off your plate. Cedric, I can't breathe.

CEDRIC	Ma. You know I didn't do this, right?

BERETTA	I know. I will call you when I find a lawyer. (bangs on door)

CEDRIC	Ma! Ma!

CECIL	I know you tired from last night's performance, but damn.

CECIL	Come on. Come on!

CECIL	Come on, now.

CECIL	Stop!

CECIL	If I were a paranoid man, I would swear you all are conspiring to embarrass me. Is that what's going on here?

BAND MEMBERS	No sir!

CECIL	You're playing like your asses itch.

CECIL	Raise your hand if your poor play is itchy ass related. Come on, don't be shy. Your asses itching?

BAND MEMBERS	No, sir!

CECIL	Then why should my ears be subjected to listening to you torture this piece of music? It's a travesty. To do nothing would be an even greater one. You agree with that, first chair?

CECIL	Do you want to challenge for first chair?

SECOND CHAIR	Yes, sir!

CECIL	What say you, a challenge?

THIRD CHAIR	No. No, sir.

CECIL	How about you, fourth chair? You want to challenge?

NONI	Yes, sir.

DANNY	Fall back, freshman.

CECIL	No. No, no, no. Anyone can challenge.

DANNY	Can I have a word with you, sir?

DANNY	I don't want her competing for first chair.

CECIL	Because?

DANNY	She doesn't deserve to. Because she shouldn't be rewarded for slipping into my band through the back door.

CECIL	You mean my band, don't you?

CECIL	Horns, up!

FIRST CHAIR	(playing jazzy saxophone solo) (panting)

SECOND CHAIR	(playing funky saxophone solo)

NONI	(playing saxophone solo) (panting)

CECIL	So we have a Charlie Parker fan.

NONI	"Donna Lee," sir.

CECIL	Was choosing one of Bird's most difficult pieces a smart choice?

NONI	I believe so, sir. I've been practicing for years, sir.

CECIL	Clearly. Drum major.

DANNY	Yes, sir.

CECIL	Noni Williams is our new first chair.

BAND MEMBERS	Challenge complete!

MAN	All right, let's go. Standing around for? Come on, everybody. Look alive. Step to it. Pick up where we left off. Come on. You, step up. You ready, right?

BAND MEMBERS	Yes.

MAN	Then do it. Come on. Step.

CECIL	Good afternoon, Madame Presidente.

EVA	I've emailed you three times, Cecil.

CECIL	I'm pretty sure I blocked you.

EVA	You and your minion should stop playing petty games because I'm not going anywhere.

CECIL	Oh, we all going somewhere: heaven, hell, whatever's in between.

EVA	You even think about going after my daughter, and you'll be the one wondering where he's getting his next paycheck.

CECIL	You know, some religions believe that after the resurrection, hell is gonna be right here on earth, but I don't know. Maybe we don't have to wait till Jesus comes again. Maybe hell is right around the corner...for one of us.

EVA	The question is, who will fight her way out? Who survives till the fire next time?

CECIL	Let's take it from the top.

MAN	Okay, let's go.

SYDNEY	Are you guys kidding me right now? Seriously? It's not like I was the only one drinking, yet nobody else is getting this lecture. And why didn't you say something when you called me?

EVA	I don't owe you an explanation for my actions, Sydney. I'm the mother.

DEREK	This is not the first time this has happened, Syd. Your behavior has got to change. I mean, at some point, you have to grow up.

DEREK	We've decided you should write an open letter to the "Daily Mountain Cat" encouraging young women to limit their consumption for their own safety.

SYDNEY	You sound like a PSA. It's not like I committed a crime.

EVA	Actually, underage drinking is a crime.

SYDNEY	I didn't mean literally.

EVA	Oh, you're not even making sense. You broke the law. And more importantly, Sydney, you almost died.

DEREK	Okay. This is what's gonna happen.

EVA	We've signed you up for the school's beautification project. It'll go a long way towards convincing people that you value this free education you're receiving here.

SYDNEY	Yeah. Okay. I just lost my appetite.

EVA	Sydney.

SYDNEY	Good night.

EVA	Sydney. Get back in here now. Syd

EVA	Why do you always let her leave like that?

DEREK	Because we need to talk...alone.

EVA	(sighs) What is it?

DEREK	There's $150,000 missing from our joint account.

EVA	All of our accounts are joint accounts.

DEREK	Which is why we don't withdraw large sums of money without talking about it.

EVA	Well, I'm not sure what we're supposed to talk about anymore.

DEREK	What was it for, Eva?

EVA	It was important.

DEREK	That's not an answer.

EVA	Well, it's the only answer I have.

DEREK	I see. So is this the part where you tell me since you came into the marriage wealthy, most of our money is your money and you can do whatever you want to with it?

EVA	Have I ever done that?

DEREK	Let's not start with what you have or haven't ever done.

EVA	Please don't do that. I used the money to pay the school's water bill.

DEREK	(laughs) Oh, come on.

EVA	Yeah, I know you don't believe anything I say, but it's true. The school's water was turned off. We're in the middle of spirit week, so

EVA	What is so funny?

EVA	What is so funny, Derek? This place is a complete wreck, every square inch of it. And I am failing! And they lied to me about how dire the budget issues are, and they are really dire. And that's not funny. I've never seen anything like it. I have no idea how to save thisthis Southern symbol of pride and hope and struggle that's now mostly about struggle, and there is nothing even remotely funny about that. One greedy asshole misappropriates funds, and here we are. This schoolthis school has the potential to be great.

DEREK	(sighs) You'll get it back there again. It just takes time.

EVA	What are you thinking about?

DEREK	(chuckles) The day we met.

EVA	(laughs) We got into a fight over how you could call yourself a Republican.

DEREK	(chuckles) A Colin Powell Republican.

EVA	Yeah, I'll give you that.

DEREK	Yeah, from that day forward, no matter what argument or misunderstanding we had, making love always made everything better.

EVA	Huh. I remember.

EVA	So are we all right now?

DEREK	Where's my wallet?

EVA	It's the middle of the night. Where are you going?

DEREK	(sighs) I love you, Eva...

EVA	I love you too.

DEREK	But we're not better. It's hard to leave you for good, but I don't want to do this anymore.

DOMINIQUE	Nope. That's all I'm asking.

DOMINIQUE	Come back to try the surf and turf? Always gets five stars on Yelp.

EVA	Actually, Mr. Briggs, I came to apologize for the overkill on my righteous indignation the other day.

DOMINIQUE	Wow. I'm sure being wrong doesn't come easy to you. Do you have to, like, practice saying that in the mirror? Have a seat.

EVA	Thank you.

DOMINIQUE	And tell me why you're really here.

EVA	Let's just say I robbed Peter to pay Paul, and Peter is really pissed off.

DOMINIQUE	Now you've come back to me with your tail between your legs hoping to part a man and his money.

EVA	A substantial amount of his money.

DOMINIQUE	You know, I can always tell two things: when somebody's not from the South and when somebody grew up with money.


EVA	And which am I?

DOMINIQUE	Both. You don't drop enough Gs in your action verbs to be anything but privileged.

DOMINIQUE	But you withdrew cash from your own account to help my alma mater, and that is big.

EVA	I am going to kill Coach.

DOMINIQUE	You don't have to do that. He only told me...

WOMAN	Hey, Dom.

DOMINIQUE	Because he knows me. Can you the, uh, ledger.

WOMAN	Sure.

DOMINIQUE	You know, my folks were street hustlers, basically, in Miami. And when no other school would take me, GAMU gave me a full ride. 
Thank you.	

WOMAN	Mm-hmm. Here you go.

DOMINIQUE	Now I got a legit business degree, several legitimate businesses to go along with it. Yeah, they been doing me dirty, you know, not accepting my money.

DOMINIQUE	But, uh, I got an opportunity there, you know? That degree, it changed my life. It really did. So this should take care of Peter; put a little something in Paul's pocket too.

EVA	Thank you very much for your generous donation. But also for sharing your story with me.

DOMINIQUE	You're welcome.

EVA	Thank you. (sighs) We're going to get youwhat happened to your face?

CEDRIC	Take care of myself.

EVA	Okay. But we'll get you a good lawyer.

CEDRIC	My mom's already on that.

EVA	I just want to help you.

CEDRIC	Wait. You haven't heard? I'm living my future. Can't nobody help me. Hey, guard, come on, man.

EVA	Cedric.
