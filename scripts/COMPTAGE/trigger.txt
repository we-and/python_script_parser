( DEAD TRIGGER)


CHRIS	His name was Walker. And finally they got a grip on what was happening. An outbreak. Many died. Or wouldn’t. Highly trained units were formed to kill the infected. Contagion Special Units - CSU - for those with an appetite for blood, and guts, and killing.Walker was a police officer in Terminal City for many years...until things went south.
CHRIS	But I got my own problems. The world went to hell for me years ago. My parents...

CHRIS	They got infected early. I lost everything thanks to this outbreak.

CHRIS	Now I keep to myself, looking for food, trying to find LV-420, hoping just to stay alive.

COMMERCIAL	Are you ready to join the fight? The fight against the biggest threat ever to mankind? Do you want to destroy the infected?

COMMERCIAL	We offer the best training and weapons, as well as Cyglobe medical insurance for your entire family. And after some hard fights you will enjoy your well deserved vacation on the paradise islands of Hawaii untouched by the infected.

COMMERCIAL	Fight for your country. For your family and friends. For the survival of mankind. Join the CSU!


GLORIA RUSSO	Since the outbreak our company has become the biggest supplier of personal weapons. Every household owns at least twelve guns made by Cyglobe. Our TV network is the most watched worldwide. It truly is one world. One Cyglobe. Proud?

MARKETING SUIT #1	Yes, Ma’am.But we need to expand.There’s only so many guns we can sell.

GLORIA RUSSO	That’s why finding the cure is the key.

MARKETING SUIT #2	The cure? Uhh, the cure to the outbreak?

GLORIA RUSSO	If we could control the cure’s rollout. We could set the price and its release date.

MARKETING SUIT #1	I mean... Is there a chance at finding the cure? Because I haven’t heard...

GLORIA RUSSO	Gentlemen, why do you think we have a lab in Terminal City?

GLORIA RUSSO	Our stock will sore. That’s why I’m in a pay grade all by myself.

GLORIA RUSSO	What is it?

EXEC ASSISTANT	We got an e-mail from Terminal City. Tara Conlan at the lab.

GLORIA RUSSO	That is all, gentlemen.

GLORIA RUSSO	What did the email say?

EXEC ASSISTANT	To call her right away.

GLORIA RUSSO	That’s it?

EXEC ASSISTANT	Oh, she mentioned they may have found the compound.

GLORIA RUSSO	Why didn’t you start out with that information?

EXEC ASSISTANT	I... I’m sorry.

GLORIA RUSSO	Get her on the phone.

EXEC ASSISTANT	I already tried, no one is answering.

GLORIA RUSSO	Okay, get me the General.

EXEC ASSISTANT	Yes, ma’am.

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Chris Norton?

CHRIS	What can I do for you?

CSU AGENT PIERCE	We’re CSU  Contagion Special Unit.

CHRIS	Wha? No infected here! That’s for sure.

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Chris, we’re here to offer you a once in a lifetime opportunity. Have you heard about the Dead Trigger Initiative?

CHRIS	Yeah, I know about it. I’ve seen the commercials.

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Only the best are selected. And you Chris, are one of the best. You will be generously paid. You ever been to Hawaii?

CHRIS	Hawaii?

CSU AGENT PIERCE	What do you think kid? Want to be a hero?

CHRIS	Yes, you will generously pay me. Now tell me more about Hawaii.

PROMOTER	And there you have it! Tonight’s overall winner! Samantha Atkins!

SAMANTHA	How was that for a show? Was I awesome?

SAMANTHA	Where’s my money?

PROMOTER	As I was trying to say, we are very happy to present you with a lifetime membership to the club.

SAMANTHA	You’re kiddin’? Where’s the cash?

PROMOTER	You see there isn’t really...

SAMANTHA	You promised a thousand bucks for the winner.

PROMOTER	There weren’t enough spectators. You can take the coupon for membership or not.

PROMOTER	You could earn some extra cash if you want...

PROMOTER	She robbed me!

POLICE OFFICER	If it ain’t Little Miss Atkins  we almost gave up looking for you, Sam. We have a nice comfy bed for you downtown.

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Samantha Atkins, or is it Sam? Your rap sheet is impressive. Lot of thefts and assaults.

CSU AGENT SAWYER	Obstructing three officers in the performance of their duties...wow.

SAMANTHA	Four. Have I won something?

CSU AGENT SAWYER	Perhaps. We can wipe your record clean, would you like that?

SAMANTHA	Alright. Let’s go.

DANIEL	Take that! That! Boom!

STEPFATHER	I’m coming! I’m coming! What?

CSU AGENT PIERCE	We’re looking for Daniel Chen.

STEPFATHER	Daniel! What has he been getting into?

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Daniel is in no trouble. Quite the opposite. We are with the CSU.

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Your, umm, stepson has been chosen to join our elite group of soldiers.

STEPFATHER	Him? He’s lazy. All he does is sit in his room all day since he lost his mother to those...

DANIEL	I’ll do it.

DANIEL	I’ll do it. I’ll kill every last one of them.

GANG BANGER #1	Slow down, Dog, you’re going to give yourself a heart attack.

G-DOG	You really don’t want to do this.

GANG BANGER #1	Why is that?

G-DOG	I’ve been training.

GANG BANGER #1	Yeah? You want a shot at the title?

G-DOG	Hey, you’re not in my weight class.

GANG BANGER #1	Got that right, punk ass little thief.

GANG BANGER #1	Only training you’ve been doing is playing those games all day.

GANG BANGER #1	You stole goggles and LV 420 from me? You know what this shit costs?

G-DOG	It’s for my Mother... She’s...

GANG BANGER #1	I don’t give a shit.

CSU AGENT PIERCE	You wanna try me?

G-DOG	Who the hell are you two?

CSU AGENT PIERCE	By the looks of things, your new best friends.

G-DOG	I don’t need your help.

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Calm down, we’re here for you Gerald Jefferson.

G-DOG	What did I do now?

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Nothing yet. That’s the point. You want the chance of a lifetime?

CSU AGENT PIERCE	Naomi Shika? We’re with CSU.

ROCKSTOCK	How you do that trick, Walker?

WALKER	It ain’t a trick... Just lucky.

ROCKSTOCK	Damn, Walker! That ain’t funny.

DANIEL	I’m Daniel. Nice to meet you guys.

G-DOG	Wassup, I’m G-Dog.

NAOMI	Naomi.

ZACK	I’m so ready to get to killing these mutants.

G-DOG	So what’s with the GI-Joes? 

DANIEL	They both come from a long line of war heroes.

G-DOG	I bet those dudes definitely both drive those big ass trucks.

CHRIS	With gun racks.

G-DOG	Most definitely.

CHRIS	So how’d they rope you into this war?

NAOMI	Don’t worry about it.

G-DOG	Nice try, player.

ROCKSTOCK	Recruits, on your feet!

GENERAL CONLAN	Good morning, recruits, my name is General Conlan, I’m commander and chief of this CSU base. Five years after Day Zero, the first outbreak, and our world is still at war. Now before you are two very important men in your life.Captain Rockstock and Captain Kyle Walker. These men will be your instructors from here on out.

WALKER	Okay, rookies, time to get your hands dirty.

ROCKSTOCK	Chen!

ROCKSTOCK	Do you wanna become food for the undead?

DANIEL	No... sir.

ROCKSTOCK	I suggest you spend less time with your computer and more time on cardio.

SAMANTHA	Seriously, how long do we have to do this?

WALKER	Long as it takes.

SAMANTHA	What the hell does that mean?

WALKER	These are your new best friends. Get to know them well.

ROCKSTOCK	Your very lives will depend on it.

DANIEL	I’ve never shot a gun before.

ZACK	Speak for yourself. Back in Texas I won the Desoto Rifle Range championship at 16.

WALKER	You are here for one thing and one thing only... To kill the dead.And it’s my job to prepare you to kill the dead before they kill you.

WALKER	This is 2nd Lt. Marchetti.

MARCHETTI	One bite, one scratch that draws blood, and you are done. However, there is a very small window of opportunity. Immediately after being bitten... the infected body part must be cut off.

SAMANTHA	That’s gross.

ROCKSTOCK	Today is live training with real weapons and real undead.

WALKER	Gerber axe with integrated knife. Machete. Various firearms depending on the mission. Most likely, a Colt M4 assault rifle and 1911 pistol.
ROCKSTOCK	Anyone care to take a shot?

WALKER	I hear you’re quite a shooter. Impress me.

ZACK	That’s a fine looking weapon, Captain.

WALKER	Shika, you’re up. I want to see what you can do with the sword of yours.

ROCKSTOCK	It ain’t CSU issue. Prove to us there’s a reason that thing is on your back, soldier.

WALKER	Wait.

WALKER	Be direct. Be aggressive. Or be dead.

WALKER	I know how you lost your family. Use that pain. It’ll save your life one day.

ROCKSTOCK	You’re next.

ERIC	Bring me the next one. These beasts have no chance against a natural born soldier!

G-DOG	Watch out, bro! Behind you!

WALKER	Hold him tight!

ERIC	NO! No, please. No... NO!!

WALKER	Hold still.

G-DOG	Who the hell is this guy Walker?

NAOMI	Dude is a stud.

CHRIS	‘Dude’ is nuts. We all better sleep with one eye open.

DANIEL	More like a tortured soul.

CHRIS	How’s that?

DANIEL	He’s famous. Killed more zombies than anybody else.

CHRIS	How do you know that?

DANIEL	I hacked into the CSU database. I checked out everyone’s record, including yours.

G-DOG	Man, that was my cousin who stole that shit.

WALKER	This is First Lieutenant Martinov. He’ll attempt to teach you special skills in the short time we have.

MARTINOV	This is a Russian GM-94 grenade launcher. CSU has a limited supply. So only one per squad.

WALKER	Uses a thermo baric grenade. Blast range of over 10 feet. 6000 degrees Fahrenheit. Key is to make it count.

MARTINOV	Let them out.

ROCKSTOCK	When you don’t have a weapon, you must become the weapon.

CADET	Watch out! They got loose!

WALKER	What’s with you guys? Get a grip.

CHRIS	Sorry, cappie.

SAMANTHA	Hey, Daniel, you coming?

DANIEL	No, I’m fine. I wanna get extra study in before bed.

SAMANTHA	You an expert yet?

DANIEL	Not yet, but I’m getting there.

CHRIS	Come on, Chen, it’s our first night out. We gotta get away from all the messed up shit around here.

DANIEL	Really guys, go on ahead. I’m good.

CHRIS	Dude, you might miss something awesome. We insist!

CHRIS	You okay? 

NAOMI	Yeah.

CHRIS	Tequila time.

SAMANTHA	 Right in the middle pocket.

CHRIS	Nice shot... for a girl.

SAMANTHA	This shot will be even better.

NAOMI	Our boy Chen is wasted.

CHRIS	I think this is his first bar.

G-DOG	Excuse me sir, there are two other tables over there.

OLD SOLDIER	About time you kids were heading back. Must be bedtime already.

CHRIS	There is plenty of room for us all.

OLD SOLDIER	This bar is for real soldiers.

CHRIS	We’re soldiers just like you.

OLD SOLDIER	Not soldiers. Dead Triggers. Where do you think the name comes from?

OLD SOLDIER	You’re called Dead Triggers cause you’re exactly that. Dead already.

CHRIS	What do you mean?

OLD SOLDIER	You kids don’t stand a chance. You have the shortest life expectancy of any unit. Dead Trigger. Dead Meat.

CHRIS	We’re an elite unit--

OLD SOLDIER	You’re CSU’s suicide squad. And you just keep comin’.

SAMANTHA	Hey!

VETERAN SOLDIERS	Teach them a lesson, Bobby! Spank that ass!

WALKER	Recruits, back to base.

OLD SOLDIER	Yeah, put um to bed, Walker.

WALKER	Let’s go!

WALKER	It’s not your world anymore. The enemy out there is like no other this country has ever faced. Our families, our friends, our neighbors. These kids are the only hope our country has to survive.Give them credit for that.

TARA	In our effort to advance medicine to the limits of our understanding, to find a cure to our oldest adversary, cancer, we unleashed Nature at her most terrifying and irrational.

TARA	While we seemingly cured cancer, by genetic manipulation and the taming of deadly viruses to attack these cancers, we ironically allowed Nature to once again take the upper hand... and attempt to wipe humanity from the face of the earth.

TARA	Everyone is dead. Professor Adler is missing. And so is his team.

TARA	What is left of them is outside this room. And I have no way out, so I will no doubt be joining them soon. Signing off.

GENERAL CONLAN	Recruits, your training has been cut short. We have a situation.

GENERAL CONLAN	We’ve lost contact with a CSU unit and several scientists. They were spearheading an investigation on Terminal Island. Due to recent deployments, you are the only ones available for this mission. To search for and rescue the missing team. Walker...

WALKER	As you know Ground Zero was the first place the virus appeared. The island has been cut off.

WALKER	We always anticipate heavy contact. There are thousands of infected in the city.

ROCKSTOCK	We couldn’t cleanse with nuclear or incendiary weapons as there are still pockets of survivors.

NAOMI	People actually still live there?

ROCKSTOCK	An unknown number who couldn’t be saved or refused to leave.

GENERAL CONLAN	There are other reasons we don’t wipe out the island. Ground Zero holds many secrets that could lead to a cure. Could reveal its origin. Terminal City is one big science experiment gone badly wrong.

WALKER	We’re heading into Ground Zero by end of day. Are you ready to rescue your fellow CSU brothers?

RECRUITS	Sir, yes, sir!

GENERAL CONLAN	And on a personal level, my daughter Tara is part of the research team. She’s worked with Doctor Adler for the last year.

GENERAL CONLAN	Find her and bring her home safely.

WALKER	Okay, listen up! We go in, search for the team and get them and our asses out of this damn place. In and out. You got that? Stay focused on the mission. We'll try to avoid any contact as much as we can. Fire only at my command! You got that? I don't want gung ho nobs shooting around wildly.Understood?

CHRIS / MARCHETTI	YES, SIR!

WALKER	This is the real deal. If you stay close to me, Rockstock and Lieutenant Martinov and you can follow orders... everyone will get out safe.

ROCKSTOCK	Remember no shooting. We don't wanna wake up this whole infested city!

WALKER	Calm down. Take a deep breath and concentrate.

DANIEL	I got it. Coming from a building about half a mile north of here.

WALKER	Martinov  go scout.

WALKER	Take G-Dog and Atkins with you.

MARTINOV	You know I only scout alone.

WALKER	I don’t believe I’m hearing this Martinov. That’s an order.

MARTINOV	She can come with me.

NAOMI	Lieutenant Martinov?

NAOMI	Martinov?

NAOMI	Hello?

NAOMI	Hey, little girl...

ROCKSTOCK	Quit messing around, Martinov.

NAOMI	Where did you go?

MARTINOV	I told you to stick close.

MARCHETTI	You okay? You get bit?

WALKER	STOP SHOOTING!

ROCKSTOCK	Who fired? WHO THE HELL FIRED?

DANIEL	I... I thought I saw something.

ROCKSTOCK	What did I say? NO SHOOTING!

CHRIS	We got company.

SAMANTHA	Thanks a lot, Daniel.

ROCKSTOCK	Move it out!

WALKER	Get your act together, Chen. Move!

G-DOG	I hope there ain’t more inside.

ROCKSTOCK	Only one way to find out. Prepare to stay alive soldier.

ROCKSTOCK	Let's get this job done!

ROCKSTOCK	Barricade the door!

ROCKSTOCK	Lights on. No guns until I order to fire. I don’t wanna attract more biters!

ROCKSTOCK	You got me?!

ROCKSTOCK	Secure the stairwell.

CHRIS	Clear.

SAMANTHA	They’re coming!

WALKER	What about the missing team? You picking up a signal?

DANIEL	Seems like it’s coming from below...

WALKER	Well is it?!

DANIEL	Yes!

ROCKSTOCK	Okay, we're moving downstairs!

MARTINOV	Step aside.

MARCHETTI	What happened here?

WALKER	Guess we just found the missing team.

WALKER	Stay in formation!

MARCHETTI	Behind you, Captain!

G-DOG	There are too many!

ROCKSTOCK	Get back! Up the stairs!

WALKER	Stay together! Stay close!

CHRIS	There’s another way!

CHRIS	Here’s my authorization.

CHRIS	This way!

CHRIS	Shit.

CHRIS	I could use some help here!

CHRIS	Perfect timing, Captain.

ROCKSTOCK	Next time stay in formation.

ROCKSTOCK	Get outta here!

WALKER	We’re not leaving you!

ROCKSTOCK	You know it’s too late, Walker. Take care of the team.

MARTINOV	He’s finished. We’re outta here.

ROCKSTOCK	I got it covered... go.

ROCKSTOCK	Burn in hell, you freaks--

G-DOG	Damn.

MARCHETTI	Anyone wounded? Any bites?

MARTINOV	This is a suicide mission. Let’s get out while we still can.

WALKER	Reload everyone. We’re here on a mission. To complete the mission.

MARTINOV	We just lost Rockstock and you’ve seen what’s left of the research team. We’re done here!

WALKER	If we want to live we have to keep it together.

DANIEL	Excuse me, guys.

WALKER	What did you say, kid?

DANIEL	Ahh, we’re getting another signal. It’s coming from two floors below.

DANIEL	There are labs on B2. The signal’s from there. We need another stairway down.

G-DOG	Aren’t we getting out of here?

WALKER	Nope. We’ve still got possible survivors. Everyone ready?

SQUAD	Yes sir!

NAOMI	Yay, more target practice.

WALKER	Show me what you can do.

G-DOG	We gonna kick some undead ass.

SAMANTHA	We've got company.

WALKER	Aim for their heads!

WALKER	We getting close?

DANIEL	The signal seems to be coming from behind that door.

WALKER	Think or know?

DANIEL	It’s coming from in there.

WALKER	Good.

WALKER	Chen, find the power override and get some light in here.

DANIEL	On it.

WALKER	Spread out and look for survivors.

WALKER	And don’t touch anything.

NAOMI	Sir...

CHRIS	Hey, Buddy.

MARTINOV	 That was the doctor we’re searching for. So now what?

TARA	Walker?

WALKER	DON’T SHOOT! WEAPONS DOWN!

TARA	To say I’m glad to see you would be an understatement. Hello, Kyle.

WALKER	Thank god you’re alive.

TARA	Thank the rabbits. I’ve been hiding in their room and eating their food.

WALKER	Is there anyone else?

TARA	We have to get this data back to my father.

WALKER	What is it?

TARA	Complete DNA sequencing for Asclepius.

G-DOG	Ass what?

TARA	Cyglobe named it after Asclepius, the Greek god of healing.Asclepius had the power to raise the dead.

G-DOG	He did that for sure.

MARTINOV	But is it a cure?

TARA	It should show us how all this began. How it mutated.

WALKER	So how about we get you outta here.

WALKER	You’ll need this.

TARA	I’ll need something more effective. Like this.

WALKER	Know how to use it?

TARA	Since I was seven. Having a General as a father sometimes has its advantages.

WALKER	Chen, I want a short and safe passage out of the building.

DANIEL	There’s an air shaft or tunnel that leads into a subway.

WALKER	Where?

DANIEL	Behind that wall over there.

TARA	Shit. It’s here.

WALKER	What?

TARA	Subject Zero.

WALKER	Subject what?

MARTINOV	What the fuck?

WALKER	Open fire!

WALKER	Daniel, no! Get back here!

DANIEL	I can do this!

SAMANTHA	Fuck, that hurt.

WALKER	Martinov! The wall!

WALKER	Go! Go! Go!

MARTINOV	Let’s go! Go!

SAMANTHA	Leave me! I can’t walk. Get out of here. I’ll cover you!

SAMANTHA	Go!

WALKER	Samantha! Get over here!

SAMANTHA	Can’t do it! Leg’s broken! Go!

WALKER	Take this! Make it count!

SAMANTHA	Take this you son of a bitch!

G-DOG	Naomi!

WALKER	She’s gone! Move it out soldier!

G-DOG	Sam!

WALKER	I said, move it out! 

WALKER	Jefferson! Get back here!

WALKER	Jeezuz... Jefferson, get back here!

G-DOG	Arghhhh!!!

WALKER	There’s more. Let’s go!

CHRIS	This way! Captain Walker!

NAOMI	I can’t get it open.

CHRIS	Let me do it.

NAOMI	Hurry!

TARA	You okay?

WALKER	What was that thing back there?

TARA	The first human experiment with the mutant DNA. They got their cancer cure. But it came with a price.

WALKER	Were you involved?

TARA	This was strictly Cyglobe.

WALKER	Man playing God creates monsters. What’s new?

TARA	Not Man... Cyglobe.

WALKER	We need cover. Over there.

WALKER	Command. This is Walker. Do you read me? Command, come in.

GENERAL CONLAN	Come in, Walker. Report your status.

WALKER	We found the missing team. Most killed.

GENERAL CONLAN	Tara?

WALKER	Alive. She’s the only survivor.

GENERAL CONLAN	Thank god. Thank you, Walker. Get her out safely.

WALKER	Get our coordinates and send in the chopper.

GENERAL CONLAN	Negative. Proceed to Plan B for departure.

WALKER	Get us out of here now, General. Pick us up.

GENERAL CONLAN	Negative. No can do. Cannot explain now. Proceed to Plan B. That’s an order.

WALKER	Copy that.

GENERAL CONLAN	Walker...

WALKER	Yes, sir?

GENERAL CONLAN	Take care of my daughter. Bring her home safe.

WALKER	Copy that, sir. I’ll do my best. Walker out.

RUSSO	See, that wasn’t so hard, was it?

GENERAL CONLAN	This will end badly for you, Russo.

RUSSO	Highly unlikely.

GENERAL CONLAN	If you harm my daughter--

RUSSO	You’ll what?

RUSSO	It’s touching that you now decide to play the sentimental father. Considering you’ve been taking my hand-outs for years.

GENERAL CONLAN	You won’t get away with this.

RUSSO	I get away with anything I want. I always have.

TARA	What did they say? When will they fly us out?

WALKER	They won’t be sending a chopper.

TARA	What?

NAOMI	You crazy, man?!

WALKER	Soldier, get a grip.

CHRIS	That does sound pretty crazy though.

WALKER	We have to proceed to a perimeter location. Remember your briefing?

CHRIS	Yeah, Plan B.

WALKER	Well, we’re doing it. Heading out in five.

TARA	Why would my father do that?

WALKER	I have no idea.

CHRIS	You see that? Is that backup?

WALKER	Don’t think so. That’s nowhere near the perimeter.

TARA	Survivors?

WALKER	What do you think, Lt?

MARTINOV	Could be survivors. We’ll stand a better chance the more we are.

WALKER	Agreed.

WALKER	Grab as much as you can carry.

CHRIS	Did you know his wife and daughter?

MARCHETTI	I did.

NAOMI	And did he really have to...?

NIKA	This is our space. Move on.

TARA	Wait. I know these girls. They’re on our side. They call them the twins.

CHRIS	Twins? They don’t look like twins to me.

TARA	It’s their nicknames. These girls are legends in Terminal City. They may have killed more Zombies than you.

NIKA	Not just zombies. You have ten seconds.

MARCHETTI	Or what? You’re seriously outgunned.

LIKA	You sure about that?

WALKER	Fall back... there’s too many.

NIKA	Follow us!

NAOMI	Thanks.

CHRIS	Seems that saving your life is my new job.

NAOMI	I can look after myself. I’m sure I’ll be saving your ass back real soon.

CHRIS	So you do like me.

MALE VOICE	Who’s there?

WALKER	CSU. Contagion Special Unit. You sent up a flare. Open the door.

FATHER JULIAN	Come in. Quickly. Quickly now.

FATHER JULIAN	Welcome to the Church of New Hope. I’m Father Julian. Please lower your weapons. This is a sacred place.

WALKER	Sorry Padre, but the mutants don’t care this is a damn church.

FATHER JULIAN	I need to get these people out. Can you help us?

WALKER	I wish we could.

FATHER JULIAN	Please. We have a van in the back...But no way of protecting ourselves out there.

WALKER	Tell you what, Padre, let us borrow the vehicle... I’ll come back for you.

FATHER JULIAN	Okay...

MARCHETTI	What are you looking for?

WALKER	Quickest way out of here.

MARCHETTI	Maybe those twins can help? Conlan’s daughter seems to think so.

WALKER	Maybe.

WALKER	I’ll go for the van. You get everyone else ready to move out.

MARCHETTI	Copy that.

WALKER	Turn the lights off outside.

NAOMI	They’re everywhere.

WALKER	Then lock the doors behind me. Or is there a another way out?

FATHER JULIAN	The side door.

WALKER	Norton, you’re gonna cover me. Can you handle that?

CHRIS	Yes, Captain.

WALKER	Martinov, you’re in charge.

WALKER	Remember your training, squad.

MARCHETTI	Walker...

WALKER	I’ll flash the headlights when we’re ready to go.

WALKER	There it is.

CHRIS	Think it will start?

WALKER	Let’s find out.

CHRIS	Excuse me, Captain, what was it like being a cop here in Terminal City?

CHRIS	What was this place like before the outbreak?

WALKER	Just get in there.

WALKER	I’m working on it. Now try it.

CHRIS	You hear that?

WALKER	Try it again.

TARA	What’s happening?

MARCHETTI	They reached the van. I think they’re gonna make it.

WALKER	Again.

MARTINOV	Get away from that door.

MARTINOV	Get back. Stay where you are. No one move. Lay down your guns and back away slowly.

MARCHETTI	What are you doing? Captain Walker is still out there.

MARTINOV	I said get away. This stays closed.

MARTINOV	There is something I need. The DNA sequence. The antidote.

MARTINOV	My new life on a paradise island  with no infected scum chewing at my ass. Living like a king.

TARA	Please don’t do this.

MARTINOV	Watch me. All courtesy of Cyglobe Industries.

TARA	You’ll never get away with it.

MARTINOV	Sure I will. Out of chaos comes order. Cyglobe will bring order back to the world.

WALKER	That should do it. Try it.

CHRIS	Alright.

CHRIS	Cap, we got company.

WALKER	Let’s go.

MARTINOV	Nobody moves.

NAOMI	You think Walker will let you live?

WALKER	Keep it running.

MARTINOV	Dasvidaniya. I’m out of here, amigo.

CHRIS	That’s enough!

WALKER	Shoot him if he moves.

MARCHETTI	Here, let me help you out with that.

MARCHETTI	You okay?

WALKER	Never better.

MARCHETTI	LV-420? The prototype treatment.

WALKER	Yeah... only one dose left.

MARCHETTI	All the more reason to get us out of here.

MARCHETTI	So then you were bit?

WALKER	Three months ago.

MARCHETTI	I know all about LV-420. I worked on the program.

WALKER	Then I won’t elaborate.

MARCHETTI	You know it’s temporary right?

MARCHETTI	That’s why we need to nail what happened with Asclepius.

WALKER	I really don’t care about any DNA sequencing.

MARCHETTI	You will when you start turning into a mutant.

WALKER	It’ll never happen. I want you to promise me that. If I can’t do it, you do it for me. Promise?

MARCHETTI	I promise. I’d expect the same from you.

WALKER	Absolutely.

CHRIS	You okay? 

NAOMI	Yeah... fine.

WALKER	How long has Cyglobe been slipping you a paycheck?

MARTINOV	Open your eyes, Walker. Once this disease is cured, everyone will have to do business with Cyglobe. Even you.

MARTINOV	That’s why no helicopter came. I was Cyglobe’s insurance policy.

WALKER	Lousy policy. Didn’t pay out.

MARTINOV	They’ll send more mercenaries if they get no message from me. Either way you’re all dead.

WALKER	Like I said, if he moves kill him.

WALKER	What can we put behind those doors?

FATHER JULIAN	How about the pews?

WALKER	They move?

FATHER JULIAN	Yes, we can move them.

FATHER JULIAN	They’re growing in numbers.

FATHER JULIAN	They are pure evil.

TARA	It’s a DNA mutation. Controlling their bodies. They’re not evil.

FATHER JULIAN	Look into their eyes and you see a demon. Each and every one possessed.

WALKER	Sorry, padre. They were created by man.

MARTINOV	Father Julian, in here we’re done for! We need to get out and make for the perimeter!

WALKER	Shut him up.

WALKER	You okay, padre?

WALKER	Can you shoot?

FATHER JULIAN	I used to be against all things violent. Not anymore. How do you think we survived all this time?

WALKER	I’ve been meaning to ask?

FATHER JULIAN	The power of the Lord, and the might of the sword.

FATHER JULIAN	Take vengeance on my adversaries and rise up to stand victorious over all demon warriors. Isaiah 27:1

WALKER	We just have to wait for them to leave. It’s all we can do.

CHRIS	How do you know they’ll leave for sure?

WALKER	I don’t.

WALKER	Norton, you can see the perimeter from here. Take a look.

CHRIS	It’s at least a couple of miles.

WALKER	Good, keep watching.

WALKER	You shouldn’t be up here.

TARA	I always wanted to be in combat. But my father wouldn’t let me.Insisted I become a scientist.

WALKER	Combat is not for everyone.

TARA	I know how to shoot.

WALKER	Knowing how to kill is not enough. You have to enjoy it.

TARA	Do you?

WALKER	We head to a pick-up zone on the perimeter. There’s a crossing on Obama Bridge. If we can make it there your father will get us out.

FATHER JULIAN	I fancy a bottle of that Irish whiskey. I’ve been too long without.

FATHER JULIAN	This is our home. God’s home. I want to protect it, until I can no more.

FATHER JULIAN	It says so in the Bible. The dead will rise. These are the end times.

FATHER JULIAN	This is my life’s purpose. I thought it was your’s too?

FATHER JULIAN	I can’t hear what you’re saying.

FATHER JULIAN	I hold no judgement of you. Only dislike.

MARTINOV	You're right. We're sitting in a trap here. It's only a matter of time until they get in and massacre us all. Your people deserve a chance to live.

FATHER JULIAN	If you don’t stop I’ll have to put the gag back on.

MARTINOV	Help yourself and help your congregation. They’re your first priority. They deserve a chance.

FATHER JULIAN	Why are you telling me this?

MARTINOV	I want to help you. I agree with you. We have to get out and fast. In one minute we'll be on our way to safety. You help me and I'll help your people.

FATHER JULIAN	Why should I trust you?

MARTINOV	Because I’m the only one who can get you outta Terminal City.

FATHER JULIAN	This is our missionary. No-one said it was supposed to be easy.

FATHER JULIAN	Forgive me, Father.

MARTINOV	Amen, Padre.

WALKER	What happened to the world?

TARA	Nature can be surprising. Death was taken away from us. Our right to die.

WALKER	Is there anything human left behind?

TARA	Somewhere in there is human consciousness. Flowing through billions of neurons. Zombie consciousness has only enough brain activity for bodily survival.

WALKER	What happens to the person?

TARA	Like being in a deep coma perhaps? We don’t know.

WALKER	Then the more we kill, the more we set free.

TARA	Something like that.

CHRIS	Captain Walker, how much further to Obama bridge?

WALKER	Three clicks.

CHRIS	We made it.

NAOMI	Not yet. You heard him. Three miles to go.

CHRIS	How long are you gonna keep up this lone wolf act?

NAOMI	For at least three more miles.

CHRIS	So when we get there, drinks are on you this time?

MARCHETTI	Padre only left us with an 1/8 of a tank?

WALKER	Get your gear and get ready. We walk from here.  Stay close.

TARA	We got to help them.

WALKER	It’s too late, they’re gone.

WALKER	I made a promise. I intend to keep it. Come with me.

TARA	Shouldn’t we go after them?

MARCHETTI	You heard what the Captain said.

TARA	Yeah, but...

WALKER	Ladies, take five. Be right back. Keep an eye out for them.

MARCHETTI	What are you going to do with the cure once we get out?

TARA	Technically I still work for Cyglobe, but after today that changes.

MARCHETTI	What do you mean?

TARA	My Father never would have left us in here without a damn good reason. Think about it, Cyglobe doesn’t want this war to stop.

MARCHETTI	War is expensive. And they make all those guns.

TARA	Exactly. I think Cyglobe got to my father. Stopped him somehow from helping us.

WALKER	Command, this is Walker. Do you read me? Command, come in. Over?Command, this is Walker. Do you read me? Over.

NIKA	Don’t move. Slowly put the weapons down.  Kick them to the side. Hands up.

NIKA	We just want the stick. Aclepius.

TARA	I don’t have it. I gave it to Walker.

NIKA	Okay... kill her.

NIKA	One last chance, you don’t have to die. At least not by us.

WALKER	No can do.

WALKER	You two okay?

WALKER	They worked for Cyglobe.

CHRIS	Stay close.

CHRIS	Don’t worry, we’ll find them. You okay?

CHRIS	Anyone ever tell you that you talk too much?

NAOMI	My parents... before... and my little sister used to make fun of me for always telling stories.

CHRIS	What stories?

NAOMI	All kinds. I used to pretend I was Alice in Wonderland. I’d imagine going down the rabbit hole.

CHRIS	Yeah?

NAOMI	I’d close my eyes and tell them everything I could see. But things changed after...

CHRIS	You miss them?

CHRIS	Things are gonna change after this.

NAOMI	You think they’ll give us medals?

CHRIS	I’d settle for Hawaii. Wanna come with?

NAOMI	So this is your move?

CHRIS	Maybe.

CHRIS	You can make it, on your feet.

NAOMI	No. You know what’s about to happen. It’s no use.

CHRIS	Hang on, I’ll get you help.

NAOMI	I don’t want to be one of them. (beat) You know what to do.

CHRIS	I can’t... I won’t.

NAOMI	Please, Chris... please.

WALKER	Command, this is Walker. Do you read me? Command, come in. Over?

MARCHETTI	You know... I’m kind of envious of you.

TARA	Me?

MARCHETTI	I always wanted to be a scientist. My dad wanted me to be one. But then I had to join CSU... the outbreak changed everything for me.

TARA	Did you know Walker...

MARCHETTI	Before CSU? No...

TARA	He ever talk about his family?

MARCHETTI	He used too. I remember one night after a mission. He finally let it out.

MARCHETTI	He came home from work, saw his wife and daughter had... turned. They attacked him. He didn’t have a choice. He had to shoot them.Right there in his kitchen.

TARA	That’s terrible.

MARCHETTI	Yeah. The worst part about it, there’s probably thousands of stories out there just as bad.

WALKER	Tara, get up here.

WALKER	Any idea why the General went silent on us?

TARA	Like I said, it has to be Russo and Cyglobe.

WALKER	Marchetti?

WALKER	Marchetti?!

WALKER	Wait here.

WALKER	Marchetti!

WALKER	God damn it.

MARTINOV	You must really hate me.

WALKER	Yeah.

MARTINOV	Soon you will get to see your wife and kid. You never did get over losing them did you. Especially when you had to put a bullet in their heads!

MARTINOV	Just don’t fight it, Walker.

TARA	Told you having a general for a father has its advantages.

WALKER	Enough of this shit.

MARTINOV	Ahhhhhhh!!!!!

TARA	You alright?

TARA	Liar.

TARA	That’s the last? I can get to work on saving you as soon as we’re out of here. You didn’t have a choice.

WALKER	They were my family, my responsibility.

TARA	This outbreak caught us all off guard. You can’t take the blame.

WALKER	‘Blame’ isn’t my game.

TARA	Neither should regret.

WALKER	I lost everything that day. Lost my family... my city... my soul. You need to save the rest of humanity. The part that still has a fighting chance.

WALKER	I belong here.

CHRIS	Walker!

CHRIS	Where’s Marchetti?

TARA	Naomi?

WALKER	Move.

WALKER	Get a grip, soldier. Let’s go.

CHRIS	That it?

TARA	Not far now.

WALKER	Check your ammo.

TARA	What is it?

WALKER	I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this.

CHRIS	To what? Getting out of here?

WALKER	Either of you ever hear of the gauntlet?

WALKER	I was afraid of that. But the gauntlet is our only chance now of getting out of Terminal City.

TARA	Why do they call the gauntlet?

WALKER	It’s like a shooting gallery for zombies. When the island became infected.  Everyone tried to get out this way. It was a blood bath.

CHRIS	The zombies are waiting there?

WALKER	So many civilians died there. The dead hang around waiting for more.

TARA	Anyone ever make it?

WALKER	Not yet.

CHRIS	There’s gotta be another way then. A way out we missed.

WALKER	Don’t you think if there was, I’d know about it?

CHRIS	Captain...

WALKER	Tara, you stay right behind me.

CHRIS	I guess I’ll cover my own ass.

COLONEL	Eagle four, this is command, Eagle four, the birds have left the nest. ETA to drop is ninety seconds.

1LT KRYCEK	Command, this is Eagle four, copy that.

1LT KRYCEK	Shit...

1LT KRYCEK	Eagle four, to command. Come in, command.

COLONEL	This is command.

1LT KRYCEK	Abort, abort the air strike!

COLONEL	Say again?

1LT KRYCEK	I have located the targets for the air strike. They are human.Repeat. They are human.

COLONEL	Is that confirmed targets are human?

1LT KRYCEK	Confirmed. I have them in sight. They’re in the gauntlet.

COLONEL	Copy that. Air strike aborted.

1LT KRYCEK	Poor bastards.

WALKER	Now’s our chance. Go.

1LT KRYCEK	Who the hell are you guys?

WALKER	Captain Kyle Walker. CSU. General Conlan send you?

1LT KRYCEK	Negative. You guys got lucky. We’re just a reconnaissance unit.

WALKER	I lost contact with General Conlan. Any word on him?

1LT KRYCEK	Negative. Captain, you were about three seconds from being blown all to hell.

WALKER	So much for Plan B.

CHRIS	Then what are you doing out here?

1LT KRYCEK	We monitor Terminal City for warm bodies. We were tracking a mission a couple of days ago. They disappeared. That you guys?

WALKER	Negative. We were sent in to find them. You didn't know about us?

1LT KRYCEK	There are no new missions scheduled for this area.

WALKER	We were set up.

1LT KRYCEK	We can debate this later. Right now...

1LT KRYCEK	We need to go.

WALKER	You heard him. Get in there.

TARA	You’re not coming?

WALKER	I made another promise. I got to get more people out. Get her out safely. She just might end this war once and for all.
TARA	You know I figured out something.

WALKER	What’s that?

TARA	What’s really left of our humanity.

TARA	It’s us, the humans. We’re what’s still right about our world.

WALKER	Don’t think that will all fit on my tombstone.

TARA	Walker!

MOM	Chris! Dinner!

CHRIS	Hey guys, we’ll pick this up tomorrow, okay?

MOM	Chris, come on, it’s getting cold.

CHRIS	I’m coming...

CHRIS	I didn’t know it then, but that was one of the last dinners I ever had with my family. The outbreak started two weeks later.

VOICE	Join CSU. Learn to fight for the cause. Make a difference.
