ANDI	Karen, she's here.	
KAREN	Who?	
ANDI	His wife.	
AARON	Previously on Sistas.	
JASMIN	He's a liar, a cheater.	
ANDI	Cheater?	
JASMIN	An abuser.	
ANDI	An abuser?	
SABRINA	He kissed a man.	
KAREN	Are you talking about a man that she met last night?	
SABRINA	Yes.  This is not funny.	
DANNI	Sorry.  Sorry.	
AARON	I just want to apologize.  I'm going through some things, too, all right?  I just found out my wife is screwing around on me.  I got some ice cream, too.  Do you want some company?  I'm Aaron.	
KAREN	Karen.	
AARON	It's nice to meet you, Karen.			
KAREN	Can I ask you question?	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	How old are you?	
AARON	Thirty-seven.	
KAREN	Hmm.  So you're the perfect age to ask.	
AARON	What is it?	
KAREN	How come you […] so full of shit?	
AARON	Oh, come on.	
KAREN	No, no.  Me and my girlfriends is all going through things.  Why?	
AARON	Maybe it's not about the men.	
KAREN	What?	
AARON	Well, maybe it's about the women who are choosing those kinds of men.	
KAREN	Okay.  Whatever.  Just forget I asked.	
AARON	(scoffs) See?	
KAREN	Forget I asked.	
AARON	But you won't take responsibility for that, will you?	
KAREN	Are you gonna take responsibility for your wife screwing somebody else?			
AARON	Wow.  Enjoy your ice cream.  Yeah?	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.  Bye.  (sighs) God […].  Ey.  Ey.  Look, I owe you eight dollars for the ice cream.	
AARON	Yeah.  You keep it.	
KAREN	No, no.  Look, I'm being an asshole to you.  I'm sorry.	
AARON	Look, we're both having a bad night, all right?  I get it.	
KAREN	I know, but still.  I mean, I shouldn't.  I promise you I'm not this type of person, okay?  I just--I was just cheated on by a man that I invested in and that's not your fault, I know, okay?  I'm sorry.  And I'm sorry about your wife.  I really am, okay?  I'm just mad at every man in the world today.  I wish I could just shoot fire from my boobs and burn them all off the planet.	
AARON	Damn, that's harsh.	
KAREN	Yeah, it is.	
AARON	Well, I'm glad God is God and you're not.	
KAREN	You better be.  (scoffs)	
AARON	Listen, have a good night, yeah?	
KAREN	I'm sorry.	
AARON	Sure.  Hope you take care.	
KAREN	You're not gonna ask for my number?	
AARON	I'm not sure I want it.	
KAREN	Oh, okay.  Okay.  Right.	
AARON	Have a good night.	
KAREN	You, too.	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	Night.	
		
KAREN	(scoffs) Still got it.

SABRINA	Oh, I'm sorry.  Tell me.  What did he do now?	
DANNI	(on phone) I'm not talking about my situation.  I'm talking about Andi's situation.	
SABRINA	What did she do?	
DANNI	Not her, her man, Gary.	
SABRINA	(on phone) What happened?	
DANNI	I'm at work, right?  Guess who I see sitting across the gate with some ho on his arm?

KAREN	I'm driving.	
SABRINA	(on phone) Hey, hold on.  I got to, um, pinch you in with, uh, Danni.  Hold on, give me a second.

DANNI	(on phone) Okay.  Right.  Right, right, right.  She should be in it.  She should be in it.	
KAREN	Hold on.  Don't move until I get back, okay?  Don't move.	
		
ANDI	(on phone) Hey, he left a voice message saying…	
KAREN	No.  No, no, no.  Listen, okay?  Listen, Danni's at the airport.  She saw Gary with some woman.	
ANDI	(on phone) What?	
KAREN	Yeah.  Did you know he was going to the airport?	
ANDI	(on phone) He left a message saying he was going out of town.  Wait, he said he was going to Albuquerque.  That's where she's from.  Stop her.	
KAREN	Okay, hold on.	
		
KAREN	Okay.	
DANNI	Is she on, yes?	
KAREN	(on phone) Yes.	
DANNI	Okay.  I'm about to blow this […] shit up, so…

ANDI	(on phone) Wait, what does she look like?	
DANNI	(on phone) It don't matter.  They both about to be bloody.  (chuckles) My God.	
ANDI	(on phone) Danni, tell me.

SINGER	A woman hear me road and it's sounding like a beat drop.	
SINGER	Ah, don't test me.  Ah, don't test me.	
SABRINA	No.  No, sir.	
SINGER	Ah, don't test me.	
SINGER	Ladies, if you feel me, show me up and let the beat drop.	
	
	
DANNI	Okay.  Somebody better explain this […] to me.	
SABRINA	Just wait until everybody else gets here.	
DANNI	She's sleeping with a married man?  Who--who does that?	
SABRINA	Danni.	
DANNI	I mean, what the hell is wrong with her?  Mm.	
SABRINA	Her?	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	Well…	
DANNI	I didn't know he was married.	
SABRINA	But you found out.	
DANNI	Yeah, and I broke it off.	
SABRINA	About a year later, Danni.	
DANNI	Wow.  Are you judging me?	
SABRINA	You know I'm not judging you.	
DANNI	Okay.  Well, then, let's stick to the subject.  Stop bringing up old shit, about old dick.  I didn't know he was 70.  He looked good for his age.	
SABRINA	Oh, my God, Danni.  All right.  Look, just maybe they didn't tell us because we didn't tell them.  Do you remember that?	
DANNI	Yeah, but I know Karen knew.	
SABRINA	Danni, how you know?	
DANNI	You know they talk all the time.  Stop fronting on me, man.	
SABRINA	Can we just simmer?  Just wait.	
DANNI	No.  Remember the other night at dinner?  Every time I tried to bring it up, every time, she kept changing the subject.	
SABRINA	Yeah.  I know.  I know, they do that.  (sighs) But let's not jump to conclusions, hmm?  Let them jus explain themselves when they get here.	
DANNI	Okay.  (laughs)	
SABRINA	Gentle, Danni.	
DANNI	Girl, you already know I don't do gentle.	
SABRINA	Be gentle.	
		
DANNI	Come on in, bitch.	
KAREN	What's up, ladies?  (sighs)	
DANNI	Oh, what's up, huh?  Did you know?	
		
KAREN	Let's just wait till she gets here, okay?	
DANNI	I asked you a question.	
KAREN	Yes.	
DANNI	Why didn't you tell us?	
KAREN	Why didn't you tell us about the man that you were seeing that was married for a year, huh?	
DANNI	Oh, you told them?	
SABRINA	Huh?	
DANNI	Huh?	
SABRINA	It just came up.	
DANNI	Oh.  See?  I told you to keep that between us, hmm?  I broke it off.

DANNI	She better.  Mm.  I talked to Zac.	
KAREN	Oh, I don't care about that.	
DANNI	We doing that now?	
KAREN	No, I don't wanna hear about it.	
DANNI	We doing that now?	
KAREN	Listen, I went to work and I told myself I'm not doing this to myself, so no.  I don't wanna hear about it.  I don't care.	
DANNI	Yes, you do.	
KAREN	No.  No, I don't.	
SABRINA	Are you sure, Karen?	
KAREN	No.  I do not care who he's with or where he is.	
		
DANNI	Come on.	
KAREN	No, I'm serious, Sabrina.	
DANNI	Oh, gosh.	
ANDI	Don't look so happy to see me.  Hello.	
SABRINA	We were just talking about you.	
		
ANDI	No shit.	
KAREN	I brought wine.	
ANDI	That's great.	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	I need something stronger.  Who's got a joint?	
DANNI	Look, y'all […] are gonna pay me for my weed.  Okay?	
ANDI	Danni.	
SABRINA	When do you pay for things?	
ANDI	You owe me so much money.	
DANNI	Shut up!	
KAREN	She don't owe me nothing because I don't give her nothing.	
ANDI	I could claim all of my taxes, you know that, right?	
KAREN	Do it.	
SABRINA	You should.	
DANNI	I got to get it.  It's in my bedroom.  I keep it in a nice safe.	
KAREN	Yeah.  Girl, she ain't got no bedroom.  Just a bed in the kitchen.	
ANDI	It's a studio.	
SABRINA	Did you even get her housewarming gift?	
KAREN	I'll get her housewarming gift when she gets a house.	
ANDI	Could you hurry with the weed, please?	
		
SINGER	(indistinct indistinctly)	
	
	
ANDI	Okay.  There's so many single men here.	
KAREN	Okay.  There's so many single men here, so why…	
DANNI	Dale Clinton.	
KAREN	What?	
SABRINA	(laughs)	
ANDI	What?  Who?	
SABRINA	Wait.  But we had a "no married guys" pact.	
ANDI	Hmm.  Okay, Sabrina.  I know that.	
SABRINA	Well, explain it.	
ANDI	Have you seen him?	
DANNI	He look good.	
ANDI	Exactly.  And he's everything I've always wanted.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.  But he's married.	
ANDI	But not for long.	
DANNI	Girl them […] be lying to you talking some, "If you just kiss it, I'll leave her."  (chuckles) He didn't say that to you?	
ANDI	No.	
DANNI	Okay.  Well, what about "Just the tip and I'll leave her and the kids."	
KAREN	(coughing)	
		
SABRINA	Danni.	
DANNI	What is it about me?	
KAREN	Girl, I love your life.	
DANNI	Yeah.	
KAREN	She just […] up.	
		
SABRINA	I know, right?	
ANDI	Okay.	
SABRINA	Okay.	
DANNI	You don't care.	
SABRINA	But Andi, seriously, you really think he's about to leave her?	
KAREN	Well, you know, she just…	
DANNI	No, no, no, no.  See, that's what you do when y'all not telling us everything.  You start talking to her like you the lawyer.	
SABRINA	Hmm.  You guys do do that.	
DANNI	I--I know it.	
ANDI	Okay.  But y'all have to swear not tell anyone.	
SABRINA	Well, I do, of course.	
ANDI	Thank you.  Danni?	
DANNI	Yeah.	
KAREN	Andi, don't tell this girl.  You know how she talks.  You know how she talks.	
DANNI	I'm getting sick of you.  I'm getting real sick of you.	
KAREN	Oh, you're sick of me?	
DANNI	Yeah.  Because I keeps secrets.  That was one time and I was upset.  I have the right.	
KAREN	Oh.  Danni, what happens when you get mad again?	
DANNI	I was young.  I was angry.	
KAREN	You was young?	
DANNI	Stop bringing up old […]	
KAREN	It was six months ago.	
DANNI	Okay.  I get it.  Are you gonna tell us?	
ANDI	Can I just say that I know he's getting a divorce?	
DANNI	He lying to you.	
SABRINA	How do you even know that?	
ANDI	No.  I know it.  And I know because you know I'm a divorce attorney.	
KAREN	Mm.	
ANDI	And I went to the court and I saw the documents being filed.	
SABRINA	Oh.	
ANDI	So he was telling the truth, Danni.	
SABRINA	I mean, that's pretty good.	
DANNI	Mm.	
ANDI	Yes.	
		
DANNI	No.	
ANDI	It…	
DANNI	Because the man I saw was not getting a divorce.	
ANDI	Okay.  What do you mean?	
DANNI	The woman was all in his armpits.  It was in there like deodorant.	
ANDI	That doesn't make any sense.	
DANNI	Look, I'm telling you what I saw.  They were holding hands like she sat down with him.	
ANDI	Like what?	
DANNI	Like this.  And she was looking at him like this.	
SABRINA	I'm getting turned on, Danni.	
KAREN	Okay.  Y'all both need to stop right now.  Both y'all.  Do you see her?  Come on.	
SABRINA	I'm sorry.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.	
ANDI	No, it's okay.  I'm fine.	
DANNI	Look all I'm saying is don't get your hopes up, okay?	
ANDI	I am fine.	
		
ANDI	I'm perfectly grounded in reality.	
SABRINA	Ooh.	
ANDI	But thanks for caring.	
DANNI	(sighs) That means she's sprung.	
ANDI	I'm not.  Right, Karen?	
KAREN	(slurps)	
ANDI	I am not, Karen.	
KAREN	Hmm?  Hmm.	
ANDI	I'm not sprung.	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.  Take a sip, girl.  This is good.  This is going good.	
ANDI	No, don't cheers.	
DANNI	(laughs)	
		
KAREN	This is good.	
ANDI	I don't believe her.	
KAREN	I know.	
ANDI	Am I that dumb?	
KAREN	No.  He is.	
ANDI	I'm being played.	
KAREN	You and me both.  (sighs)	
ANDI	What the hell is wrong with me Karen, hmm?  Hmm?	
KAREN	You forgot the "N."	
ANDI	What?	
KAREN	It's what the hell is wrong with me with an "N" as in what the hell is wrong with men?	
ANDI	(scoffs) Karen, we are smart, and strong, and independent, we got our own money.	
KAREN	Yup.	
ANDI	We cute as hell.	
KAREN	Yeah.	
ANDI	Why do we keep getting wrapped up in these clowns?  It's ridiculous.	
KAREN	I know.  Gosh.	
ANDI	Why do you keep saying I know?	
KAREN	Well, I do.  I'm in it with you.	
ANDI	I know.	
KAREN	You're saying I know.	
ANDI	I just--I can't do this to myself anymore.	
KAREN	I know.	
ANDI	Don't say it.	
KAREN	I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.	
ANDI	Do you think that Danni really saw what she said she saw?  I mean she's high all the time.  I mean…(chuckles) maybe she saw something else.	
KAREN	Danni is a lot of things but she ain't no liar.	
ANDI	Then that doesn't make sense.  Why would he lie to me and then she come into my firm and want a divorce but then be hugged up with him at the airport?	
KAREN	You know that I am…	
ANDI	Is she playing me?	
KAREN	Conspiracy theorist 101, but that shit would be crazy as hell.	
ANDI	Well, you know she hired a private detective.	
KAREN	I know.  You told me that.	
ANDI	She could be doing any…	
KAREN	You told me that, but think about it.  If she wanted to blow your shit up, she would have done it.	
ANDI	But what if she was just waiting for…	
KAREN	Okay.  Stop.  Stop.  Andi, Stop.  You are one of the best judges of character.  Okay?	
ANDI	Yeah.	
KAREN	Just think about it.  You always know.  Is she playing you?	
ANDI	(sighs) No.	
KAREN	See?	
ANDI	Either she has no idea or she is the best actress in the world.	
KAREN	Yeah, but…	
ANDI	He must be a good actor, too.	
KAREN	No, girl.  You lying.	
ANDI	I know.	
KAREN	(sighs) Listen, do what you got to do.  Okay?	
ANDI	I know.	
KAREN	Now you're saying "I know" again.	
ANDI	I know.  Okay?	
KAREN	So what you gonna do?	
		
ANDI	It's over.  I am done.  I cannot keep doing this to myself.  That's that.	
KAREN	That's exactly how I feel about Zac.  It's over.	
ANDI	That's right.	
KAREN	It is done.	
ANDI	It's done.  It's dead.  (laughs) We don't need 'em.  (laughs) We don't need 'em.  Uh-uh.  Nope.  That's it.  (laughs)	
KAREN	Is that right, girl?	
ANDI	Yeah, uh-hmm.	
KAREN	Okay.	
ANDI	Yeah, I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.	
KAREN	Give me tissue.	
ANDI	Yup.	
	
	
DANNI	Thanks, girl.  'Cause them […] left like I'm the maid or something.	
SABRINA	It's okay.  She's distraught.  And I'll help.	
DANNI	She can be distraught and pick up after herself.	
SABRINA	Oh, come on, Danni.  Here.	
	
	
SABRINA	Oh.  No.  No, sir.	
DANNI	That's him?	
SABRINA	(sighs) Yeah.	
DANNI	Just ask him?	
SABRINA	No.	
DANNI	Okay.  I'm gonna do some research.	
SABRINA	I don't know.  Whatever he was doing with that guy just didn't sit right with me at all.	
DANNI	All right.  Well, what's his handle?	
SABRINA	I don't know.	
DANNI	What's his first and last name?	
SABRINA	Calvin Rodney.	
	
	
SABRINA	(gasps)	
		
CALVIN	(on phone) Hello?	
		
SABRINA	Damn it!	
CALVIN	(on phone) Hello?	
SABRINA	Hi!	
CALVIN	(on phone) Hey, how are you?	
SABRINA	How are you?  I'm good.	
CALVIN	(on phone) I texted you all day.	
SABRINA	Yeah.  You know, it's--it's been a really long day.	
CALVIN	(on phone) Oh, yeah?	
SABRINA	Yeah.	
CALVIN	(on phone) Well, why don't you tell Calvin all about it?	
SABRINA	You know, I just worked a lot and, uh, one of my girlfriends is going through it, so I'm just--I'm tired.	
CALVIN	(on phone) Oh, uh, okay.  Well, I guess I'll let you go.	
SABRINA	Okay.	
CALVIN	(on phone) Lunch tomorrow?	
SABRINA	Well, you know, we have so much to do at the bank.  The 1st is our busiest day, you know.	
CALVIN	(on phone) It's the 9th.	
DANNI	(chuckles)	
SABRINA	Um, yeah.  See?  That is literally how tired I am.	
CALVIN	(on phone) Okay.  Come on.  What's the deal?	
SABRINA	What do you mean?	
CALVIN	(on phone) Look, I'm a grown man, you're a grown woman.  I don't have time to play games.	
SABRINA	I'm not playing games.	
CALVIN	(on phone) Then what is it?  I mean, we had two great dinners and now you're avoiding me.	
SABRINA	I'm not avoiding you.	
CALVIN	(on phone) Okay.  How about this?  Why don't you hit me up when you want to?	
SABRINA	Come on, Calvin.  Don't be like that.	
CALVIN	(on phone) Be like what?  You're the one that's avoiding me.	
SABRINA	I'm really not blowing you off.  I'm just…	
CALVIN	(on phone) All right.  Have a good night.	
		
SABRINA	Hello?  Hello?	
DANNI	Ooh, he hung up?	
SABRINA	Yeah.	
DANNI	Well, girl, you know, I'mma have the tea.  I'll have it to you by the morning.	
SABRINA	I don't--I don't know.  You know, you got to be at work in a few hours.	
DANNI	So whatever.	
SABRINA	Are you sure?	
DANNI	Didn't you know I stay on the 'Gram all night when I can't sleep?	
SABRINA	Okay, thanks.  Just lock your door, okay?	
DANNI	Okay.  I wish a bitch would walk up in here on me.	
DANNI	He'll regret it.	
		
SABRINA	All right, girl.  I love you.	
DANNI	Love you, too.		
SABRINA	The door.	
		
GARY	Hey, babe.	
ANDI	You shouldn't be here.	
		
GARY	What do you mean?	
ANDI	I mean you need to leave.	
GARY	I know I disappeared, but I had to go out of town.	
ANDI	Where?	
GARY	I told you, to New Mexico.	
ANDI	And why?	
GARY	I had a family emergency.	
ANDI	What was the emergency?	
GARY	Something happened to my mother-in-law.	
ANDI	What happened to her?	
GARY	Am I on the stand here?  Are you cross examining me?	
ANDI	Where did you go?  Who were you with and how did you get there?	
GARY	What the hell is going on?	
ANDI	How did you find me, hmm, Gary?  I mean, I know we met at a grocery store, but how did you find me?  How does your gym happen to be across the street?	
GARY	I don't understand.	
ANDI	Am I a game to you, Gary?	
GARY	Andi.	
ANDI	You come into this house at 4:00 in the morning like I'm some two-dollar whore that you get to […] when your wife isn't looking.  And then you sneak.  I am sick of this shit.	
GARY	I know.  You know what I worry about?  Here I am, married, and I meet this incredible woman who gives me everything that I need.  And you deserve so much more, so much better.  I'm so sorry, Andi.  I didn't even know I was making you feel like this.  If you want me to, I'll go home and tell her that I'm leaving her right now and I will get my stuff and I'll bring them over here if you want me to.  I will.	
ANDI	Do it.	
		
GARY	Okay.  But you know this is gonna devastate my kids, right?  It will.  This is not a game.  Gee has autism and if I'm going for more than a day, he has major issues with it.  I can choose between you and her.  Baby, you're the one.  I don't know how to choose between you and breaking up the life that they know.  I'm just trying to figure it out.	
ANDI	I don't care.	
GARY	You don't mean that.	
ANDI	I do.  Now, you make a damn decision and you make it now.	
GARY	I can't believe you're acting like this.  What'd I miss?  Did something happen when I was gone?	
ANDI	Gary…	
GARY	Are you seeing someone else?	
ANDI	Are you seriously asking me that question?	
GARY	I have this ring.  Will you marry me?	
ANDI	You are married.	
GARY	I won't always be.	
ANDI	Take that ring and leave.	
		
GARY	Baby…	
ANDI	Why are you not listening to me, huh?	
GARY	Just tell me, what is it?	
ANDI	I am tired of this.  That's what it is.  I'm tired.	
GARY	I can't believe you're acting like this.	
ANDI	I am tired of your bullshit.  I'm done.	
GARY	Baby…	
ANDI	Now get out!	
GARY	Baby, please.

ANDI	(panting) Hey.	
KAREN	(on phone) What's wrong?	
ANDI	He came to this damn house.	
KAREN	What'd he say?	
ANDI	Just a bunch of bullshit.  I'm so mad at him.	
KAREN	Okay.  I know you must be.	
ANDI	I just wanna […] him up.	
KAREN	Andi, that ain't you, girl.  Come on.	
ANDI	(sniffles) (sighs) I believed him.	
KAREN	I know.	
ANDI	(on phone) Don't start with the "I know" […] Karen.	
KAREN	(stammers) Uh, look.  I don't know what else to say.	
ANDI	(sighs) I gotta go.	
	[SOMBER MUSIC]	
KAREN	(on phone) Okay.  Call you later.	
SINGER	I just wanna be.  I just wanna be myself again.  Myself again.			
SABRINA	We need to get the audit finished.	
MAURICE	Okay.

CALVIN	Yes, I just need to make a deposit.	
MAURICE	ID, please.	
CALVIN	(chuckles) Bro, I've been coming in here every week.  You don't know who I am, brother?	
MAURICE	You always go to my co-worker, so no.	
CALVIN	(chuckles) Well, from now on, I'll be coming to you.	
		
MAURICE	Hmm.	
CALVIN	So, you think you could remember my name?	
MAURICE	That'll be very easy to do, sir.	
CALVIN	Thank you.  Appreciate it.	
MAURICE	Uh-hmm.  There you are, Mr.  Rodney.	
CALVIN	Oh, please.  Call me Calvin.	
MAURICE	Well, I'm Maurice.	
CALVIN	Nice to meet you, Maurice.  Thank you.	
MAURICE	Is there anything else I can do for you?	
CALVIN	You remembering who I am is good enough for now.	
MAURICE	I'll never forget you.	
CALVIN	Oh, thank you.  Appreciate that.  You think I can get your phone number?			
MAURICE	Yes!  Yes.	
CALVIN	Okay, cool.  Thanks.  You think we can meet up for coffee later?	
MAURICE	Yes.	
CALVIN	All right.  I'mma call you.	
MAURICE	Okay.  Bye, Calvin.	
SABRINA	Maurice, this isn't right.  What is this right here?  You need to really slow down.  (sighs)	
MAURICE	What the hell is going on?	
SABRINA	You and your job.  (sucks teeth)	
MAURICE	No, that--that is right.  That's a seven right there, baby.	
SABRINA	Well, then maybe you need to write better.	
MAURICE	Okay.  Okay, I got it.  I'm the enemy today.  It's fine.	
SABRINA	You're not the enemy.	
MAURICE	Well, I will be.	
SABRINA	What?	
MAURICE	(sighs) Girl, he asked me for my number.	
SABRINA	What did he say?	
MAURICE	He--he just asked me for my number and then invited me out for a coffee date.	
SABRINA	(scoffs) Are you serious?	
MAURICE	Yeah.  Do you mind?	
SABRINA	No.  No, no, not at all because he obviously needs to figure out what he likes.	
MAURICE	(sighs) Sabrina, I know that you went out on a date with him…	
SABRINA	No.	
MAURICE	I can tell him I'm not interested.	
SABRINA	No, it's okay.  I'm not interested.  It's fine.	
MAURICE	(sighs) Are you--are you sure?	
SABRINA	Yes.	
MAURICE	I don't have to go.  You don't…	
SABRINA	No, it's okay.  You know what, I'm so sorry.  This--this was totally right.  My bad.  I made a mistake.  Um, don't worry about it.  I got it.	
MAURICE	Are you sure?	
SABRINA	Yeah.  Go to have coffee with him.	
MAURICE	I'm sorry, Sabrina.	
		
DANNI	(on phone) Hey.	
SABRINA	(sighs) No need to do your research.	
DANNI	What happened?	
SABRINA	(on phone) I found out everything that I needed to know.	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	Yeah, girl.  He came in here and he asked Maurice out on a date.	
		
DANNI	(laughing)	
SABRINA	Danni?  Danni, what are you--Danni, are you laughing at me?  Did you put me on mute?	
DANNI	Nothing, girl.	
SABRINA	Ooh, you know what, I can't stand you.	
DANNI	I'm sorry, girl.  (laughs)	
SABRINA	Yeah, okay.  Whatever.	
DANNI	I'm sorry, but that […] is funny.	
SABRINA	Girl, you know, what?  Bye.	
DANNI	(on phone) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.	
SABRINA	No.  No, whatever.  I'mma remember this.	
DANNI	(on phone) No, wait, wait.	
SABRINA	Nope, gotta go.  Gotta go.	
		
SABRINA	(sighs)	
DANNI	Hello?  Yeah.  (laughs)	
SABRINA	Asshole.	
		
ZAC	Excuse me.  Excuse me.  (chuckles) Please exit to your right, ladies, yes.  Yes, follow me.  Follow me.  Yes, yes.  Yes, yes.  Yes, yes.	
BECKY	We are going to party.  (chuckles)	
ZAC	Well, here you go.  She'll help you out.	
BECKY	Thank you.	
PATSY	You should come with us.	
BECKY	Yeah, that would totally rock.	
ZAC	Oh, I'd love to but I can't.	
BECKY	Oh, come on.	
PATSY	We're gonna be on her dad's yacht and the keys…	
ZAC	At the yacht?	
PATSY	Just the three of us girls.	
BECKY	Can you come?	
ZAC	Um…	
DANNI	Hello.	
BECKY	Hi.	
DANNI	Welcome to Higher Airlines.  Can I get you guys checked in?	
BECKY	As long as you can get him a seat with us in first class.  (chuckles)	
DANNI	Bet.  Let's just get you girls checked in here.	
PATSY	I'll hit you up on the 'Gram.	
ZAC	Oh, I don't--I don't have one.	
BECKY	Oh.	
PATSY	Well, here. This is my number.	
ZAC	Thank you.	
DANNI	Come on, ladies, fasten your seatbelt.	
BECKY	We're all here already.  Can you just check us in?	
LINDSAY	I'll go with you.  Come on.	
DANNI	Su--sure.  Silly me.  All right.  Confirmation?	
BECKY	So, are you gonna come with us?	
ZAC	I'll think about it.	
BECKY	Okay.	
PATSY	Come.	
ZAC	I--I would but I just--I--I don't know.  I don't know.	
PATSY	What do you have to lose?  Just come for the weekend.	
LINDSAY	Becky?	
BECKY	What?	
LINDSAY	She said she can't find our reservations.	
BECKY	What?	
DANNI	I'm so sorry.	
BECKY	We just confirmed online.	
DANNI	You did?  I'm just not seeing it here.  Okay, um…	
BECKY	Okay.  Well, you better find it then.	
DANNI	Oh.  Yes, ma'am.  We will.	
BECKY	Oh my God.  My dad is gonna be so pissed.	
ZAC	It's alright.  It's alright.	
DANNI	All right.  We--hey.  Let me see what I can do here, okay?	
BECKY	Okay.	
		
DANNI	Yeah, I--I have another flight leaving but all the seats are coach.	
BECKY	Coach?	
DANNI	Yeah.	
BECKY	What the hell?	
DANNI	I know.	
LINDSAY	We don't do coach.	
BECKY	Well, that's all we have, Lindsay.	
PATSY	Hey.	
LINDSAY	Oh, my God.	
PATSY	Don't worry about it.  I'll call my daddy.  We can use his plane.	
BECKY	Girl.	
DANNI	Go, daddy.  Yes.	
BECKY	Wait, really?	
PATSY	Yes, come on.	
BECKY	(chuckles) Your airline should be called "The Lower."	
PATSY	Uh-hmm.	
DANNI	Oh, so sorry.  Come again, please.	
ZAC	I'll be right there, ladies.  I apologize greatly.	
DANNI	Take care.	
ZAC	I don't know.  This is not just satisfactory.  This is not a representation of the highest.  Some of us work harder than others.  Why you cancel they reservation?
	
DANNI	If you go with them white girls, I will blacklist you.	
ZAC	Blacklist me?	
DANNI	Yeah.  And you won't be able do anything black.	
ZAC	(scoffs) You're crazy as hell.	
DANNI	Where are you staying?	
ZAC	Don't worry about it.	
DANNI	I am worried about you, boy.	
ZAC	You only wanna know so you could tell Karen.	
DANNI	No, I don't.	
ZAC	Uh-hmm.  Yes, you do.	
DANNI	You know I'll find out.	
ZAC	I don't care.  I don't.	
DANNI	Look, just tell me.	
ZAC	No.	
DANNI	And you better not be with old girl.	
ZAC	(sucks teeth) Whatever.  Bye, Danni.	
DANNI	You better not go with them white girls.  Did you see "Get Out"?	
ZAC	You need help.	
DANNI	If they try to get you some tea, don't drink it.	
ZAC	What is wrong with you?	
DANNI	Don't drink it.	
		
ZAC	I'm coming, ladies.  Cart coming through.	
		
CALVIN	Hey, there he is.	
MAURICE	Hi.	
CALVIN	How are you?	
MAURICE	I'm--I'm great.	
CALVIN	Please, have a seat.	
MAURICE	I'm honored to be invited.	
CALVIN	Uh, it's no problem.  So, what are you having?	
MAURICE	Anything black.	
		
CALVIN	Okay.  Regular…	
MAURICE	Yes, regular with cream.	
CALVIN	Yeah.  Well, lucky for you it's what I got.	
MAURICE	Hmm.  (chuckles) I must say I was surprised that you invited me here.  You know, I thought that you were into my home girl at the bank.  (chuckles) Silly me.	
CALVIN	I am.	
		
MAURICE	Oh.	
CALVIN	Wait, oh.  I'm so stupid.  You thought I invited you here so you and I could…(groans)	
MAURICE	Well, I didn't think that you were interested in her.	
CALVIN	No, it's nothing against you.  It's just that--well, I'm not into guys.	
MAURICE	Then why am I here?	
CALVIN	Well, I was hoping that you could help me with your girl, Sabrina.	
MAURICE	Help you how?	
CALVIN	Look, I really like her.  Can you tell me why she's not into me?	
MAURICE	(sighs) I don't know.	
CALVIN	Oh, come on, bro.  I really wanna get to know this girl.	
MAURICE	Well then maybe you should talk to her.	
CALVIN	I tried.  Come on, can you help me?	
MAURICE	You have to excuse me but I am really finding challenges with you inviting me here and not being interested in me.	
CALVIN	I know.  I'm sorry.	
MAURICE	And I--I must say I've never met a straight man who would do something like this.	
CALVIN	Well…	
MAURICE	So…	
CALVIN	I mean I'm not your average straight guy.	
MAURICE	(scoffs)	
CALVIN	My fathers, they're gay.	
		
MAURICE	What did you say, what?	
CALVIN	Hmm.  Yeah.  I have two fathers.	
MAURICE	Well, how…(stammers) how does that go?	
CALVIN	I'm not sure I know what you mean.	
MAURICE	You know, what was that like growing up like that?	
CALVIN	Hmm, growing up like what?  I mean, we lived a normal life.  I mean, sure I got teased here and there, but it's whatever.  Look, I just look at people as people, that's all.	
		
MAURICE	Damn.  I'm falling in love with you.	
CALVIN	(laughs) Well, I'm flattered.  But do you think you could help Sabrina fall in love with me?	
MAURICE	(clicks tongue) I think I can help you with that.  But I'm gonna need something stronger than this coffee.	
CALVIN	Okay.  Well, no problem but how about we just finish these first?  All right?	
MAURICE	Fine.  You better be lucky you cute.	
CALVIN	(laughs)	
MAURICE	So, two fathers.  No?  I know that's possible.  But tell me all about it.	
CALVIN	Well, now you put me into a bargain.	
		
BELLAMY	Andi.	
ANDI	Hi.	
BELLAMY	Did you have a good night?	
ANDI	It was good.	
BELLAMY	Good.  And did you have a chance to think about that issue?	
ANDI	Yes.	
BELLAMY	And I see you made a decision.	
ANDI	Um…(chuckles) what do you mean?	
		
BELLAMY	She's in the lobby.	
ANDI	What?	
BELLAMY	Yes, did you speak with her?	
ANDI	No, I haven't.	
BELLAMY	Okay.  Well, after your meeting, come talk to me, please.	
ANDI	Okay.  (sighs) Hi.	
JASMIN	Hi.	
ANDI	I wasn't expecting you today.	
JASMIN	I wasn't expecting to come.  Can we talk?	
ANDI	Of course.  Right this way.  (sighs) Can I get you anything?	
JASMIN	Um, no.  No.  Um…	
ANDI	Okay.  Well, how can I help you?	
JASMIN	This is terribly embarrassing.  Terribly, yeah.	
ANDI	What is it?	
JASMIN	First off, let me start with this.	
ANDI	Go on.	
JASMIN	I wanted to come here personally to thank you.	
		
ANDI	Thank me?	
JASMIN	Yes.	
ANDI	Oh, um, for what?	
JASMIN	(sighs) I don't know what it was.  But, me coming here talking to you, like, letting everything out.  I mean, hearing myself say all those things that I was going through helped me somehow.	
ANDI	Well, I'm glad that I could help.	
JASMIN	Hey, you don't understand how hard it is not being able to tell anyone.	
ANDI	I understand.	
JASMIN	My friends are--they're so judgmental I think that they were happy that I was going through a divorce.	
ANDI	And, um, what about the mistress?	
		
JASMIN	I don't think there really is one.  We haven't been able to prove it.  But, here, I'm gonna tell you this, I'm not gonna let some horrible, miserable, wicked person without a soul destroy my marriage.  I mean, anyone who sleeps with another person's husband is clearly the devil, right?  I mean, anyway I said all that to say that I'm not gonna go through with the divorce.	
ANDI	No?	
JASMIN	No.  That man loves me and he made that clear to me this morning.  He cried in my arms telling me how much he loved me, and how much he wanted this to work out.	
ANDI	Is that so?	
JASMIN	Yes.  Yes.  We're gonna stay together.  I have to give him another chance, and he also gave me this new ring.  (giggles)	
		
DANNI	Next on Sistas…	
ANDI	I don't need this and I don't need him.  No.  No.	
KAREN	No, no.  How many years were y'all married again?	
AARON	Fifteen.	
KAREN	No love for her?	
AARON	I will always love her.	
		
MAURICE	He was sitting there looking all good, and I was sitting there looking all good.  And all he could say was, "Can you hook me up with your friend?"	
DANNI	Zac, I know you've been staying in a shelter.  Get your things and you can come to my apartment.	
ZAC	I don't know.	
DANNI	I really need help with half the rent.  Come on.  Can you take out the trash, too?  It's been stanking.	
ZAC	Oh, I want my rent back.
