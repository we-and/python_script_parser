FEIFEI	Hey, Big guy! Wanna team up?   

FEIFEI	Team-up!

FEIFEI	Lucky for you... I need a partner.

FEIFEI	Look at you with your big belly and short legs. You won't last long out here.

FEIFEI	You need someone… to watch your back.

FEIFEI	Heheh, you don't know me? Geez, you really are new! Listen up! Best hunter in the forest! Never run from fight. The biggest bully of the mountain.

FEIFEI	Tear up my prey? No sweat! 

FEIFEI	Warrior of the pack, …"Feifei!"

FEIFEI	OK. We're done here. We should go now. The Courage Fruit is waiting!

FEIFEI	Huh? You don’t know? The Courage Fruit up there!

FEIFEI	Okay! Well, let’s make a deal then. If you help me get the Fruit, then I’ll make sure no one dares to lay a finger on you.

FEIFEI	Hey, don’t go! I’m not finished!

FEIFEI	Hmm, well… How about Team Wolf-bear?

FEIFEI	Hey! Wait! I’m serious!

FEIFEI	You mean the hairless monkey and the clumsy bear?

FEIFEI	They fell right to their doom.

FEIFEI	Wha..!


FEIFEI	You're friends are gone. You can help me get the Fruit! You and I, we could make a great team! We - Ugh!

FEIFEI	Wow! You're really scary!

FEIFEI	Hey! Big bear! A little grumpy though.

FEIFEI	Relax. He won’t bite you.

FEIFEI	He guards the bamboo forrest.

FEIFEI	But, uh… all he does is sleep.

FEIFEI	Well then… Lookin' for the exit? There.   

FEIFEI	Humph!

FEIFEI	Oh? Welcome back. You change your mind?

FEIFEI	They pretty much run this place

FEIFEI	They're the only ones out here really.

FEIFEI	At least they were, until you came along.

FEIFEI	And look... They just love you!

FEIFEI	Hey! Big bear!

FEIFEI	Team up with me. I’ll get you out of here and help find your friends…

FEIFEI	And you help me get that Fruit.

FEIFEI	Team Wolf-bear. What do you say? Shake on it?

FEIFEI	Come on! You're runnin' out of time. Aren’t your friends waiting for you to save them?   

FEIFEI	Ah, big hero. It’s just a paw shake. Real easy. Come on.

FEIFEI	Of course I will.

FEIFEI	Hey, snap out of it! Now's our chance. We gotta go!

FEIFEI	This forest is really dangerous. So stay alert! Or we can end up as someones dinner!

FEIFEI	Hehe. Oh, you'll be fine alright. Just… follow me.

FEIFEI	Careful!

FEIFEI	Don’t pick that!

FEIFEI	Wouldn't do that! 

FEIFEI	Bad idea!

FEIFEI	Don’t sit there!

FEIFEI	Nope...!

FEIFEI	No, no, no!

FEIFEI	As a matter of fact… not really.

FEIFEI	Now you see how tough I really am? And now… I’m gonna eat you up!

FEIFEI	Hey! Are you okay? Huh?

FEIFEI	What are you doing here?

FEIFEI	I’m not the same old Feifei. Raaar! I’m much stronger now!

FEIFEI	...I’m not scared! I'll eat it right now!

FEIFEI	Ahhh It stinks.

FEIFEI	This isn't even fresh! I'm not getting sick to prove a point.

FEIFEI	Big bear, I'm sorry... I lied to you. ...I'm not the toughest in the forest. I'm... I'm just a coward. Every time I catch my own prey, I just feel sorry for it and let it go.

FEIFEI	I feel like... I don't belong in the pack.

FEIFEI	Courage Fruit.

FEIFEI	It’s called... Courage Fruit!

FEIFEI	The others say... I'll never make it. Humph! But I’ll show them. I, Feifei, will be full of courage! 

FEIFEI	Big bear, come here! Hurry!

FEIFEI	The Courage Fruit is the most magical thing in the forest. Eat it, and you'll become super brave. Come on, big bear. Look! The Courage Fruit is right up there, on that tree!

FEIFEI	They say... the giant bird Dooma is so strong because he has eaten the fruit. He's always guarding that tree so he can keep all the Courage Fruit to himself. Humph! After I eat the Courage Fruit, I'll become a true warrior of the wolf pack.

FEIFEI	I know I can do it. ...brother.

FEIFEI	Let’s go, big bear. We’ll reach the human village by tomorrow.

FEIFEI	Big bear, where do you come from?

FEIFEI	2019? What kind of place is that?

FEIFEI	Oh. Then our place here is more exciting than yours.

FEIFEI	Big bear, there’s a bee hive there!

FEIFEI	Oh no. They're fighting. This isn't good.

FEIFEI	Uh... King!

FEIFEI	Briar?

FEIFEI	Shall we go? …to Courage Cliff?  

FEIFEI	Bramble, maybe you should join Team Wolf-bear.

FEIFEI	I… I haven’t...

FEIFEI	But… the bears, they're my friends…

FEIFEI	After we get the Fruit, you guys should hurry home. Before King gets you.

FEIFEI	Uh...

FEIFEI	Eh, Hey! Don’t worry about me. Once we get that Fruit, I'll be as strong as the Dooma! I'll become a true warrior of the wolf pack!

FEIFEI	Briar! Quick!

FEIFEI	The Courage Fruit. Where’s the Courage Fruit? Huh? Wha… Where is it? Where it is?? But why…  I don't…

FEIFEI	Oh, I know!

FEIFEI	This is the Courage Fruit. Can’t believe... it’s so big. Right, Briar?	

FEIFEI	No! You're lying! Why are you lying!?

FEIFEI	I have to become brave!

FEIFEI	Brother, I’m sorry. I feel so useless…

FEIFEI	I’m such a coward. What can I do to be brave like you?

FEIFEI	Hunter!

FEIFEI	Briar, what do I do to become brave?

FEIFEI	Briar!

FEIFEI	The Butterfly Cave... Its just up ahead. It’s time for us to say goodbye. Hey, big Bear... Take care of yourself.

FEIFEI	Mhm.

FEIFEI	Wait!

FEIFEI	King, please... just let them go. You can do anything to me. Just let them leave.  

FEIFEI	Because you are my friends. I’m here to help you.

FEIFEI	Briar, right behind you!

FEIFEI	Wait! Some of us are still over there!

FEIFEI	Stop!

FEIFEI	Wait! Some of us are still trapped there. We need to save them first.

FEIFEI	Briar!

FEIFEI	Uh… Oh, King?

FEIFEI	I… I...

FEIFEI	Hunter!

FEIFEI	You're right. I'm no good at hunting, and I won't kill. But... I know.. I have to protect my friends!

FEIFEI	No, I’m not. I’m not… a coward!

FEIFEI	Briar! This way!

FEIFEI	Briar! Seriously? A tough guy like you... crying? Hehe

FEIFEI	Briar! Don’t worry about me. No one can hurt me anymore. Besides, I’m around Stone, Lin, and the rest of their human friends! So.. so… Briar, I want to let you know… That courage fruit I was looking for… It was you.

FEIFEI	Oh, That’s right! Haha.

FEIFEI	Huh? Mhm.

FEIFEI/BRIAR	Team Wolf-bear! Yeah!
