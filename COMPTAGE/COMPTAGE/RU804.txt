RUPAUL	Previously on "RuPaul's Drag Race"…  Last week, double elimination left a void that I've decided to fill with…

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Bitches, I'm back!  Yeah!

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez.  For this week's maxi challenge, you'll be acting in "RuCo's Empire."

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Whoo!

FAITH & RUPAUL	Action.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	This.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	This.

ROBBIE TURNER	I'm a strong, gay womactan!

RUPAUL	Okay.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Please, sir, empty your…(gibberish)  Please, ma'am, will you empty your pocketbook?  Gah!

MICHELLE	I feel like you're coming out and these clothes are wearing you.  I'd love to see you show me that you do have soul.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen, condragulations, you're the winner of this week's challenge.  Robbie Turner, shantay, you stay.  Cynthia Lee Fontaine, sashay away.

ACID BETTY	Whoo!  Uh-uh!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Aw.

ACID BETTY	Cucu.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Cynthia just got eliminated.  My continental Puerto Rican sister's gone.  I'm really sad.

ROBBIE TURNER	"Don't give up.  Love you."  Isn't the sweetest?  I can't wait to see her again.

DERRICK BARRY	You want her to come back then?

ROBBIE TURNER	Derrick, let's not get crazy.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Cynthia is so loveable, but girl, that may have been the worst outfit in "Drag Race" history.  Alyssa, you're safe.  And those (bleep) jogging shorts she had on?  Red stockings?  Going out looking like Sofia Vergara's less fortunate cousin, the one she don't send money to.

ACID BETTY	I think it was legendary that you freaking did a lip-synch for your life with skates.

ROBBIE TURNER	Well…

NAOMI SMALLS	Bitch, you killed that (bleep).

ROBBIE TURNER	Actually, I'm feeling shaken in this competition right now, and the thing that I know I can do--acting, I fail at?  I'm feeling really disappointed in myself.

DERRICK BARRY	I think I got good critiques, like, we're seeing something different, but then I got told from Michelle that I don't really have a soul.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Michelle said you don't have soul.  She didn't say you don't have a soul.

DERRICK BARRY	Then I'll just start twerking.  Come on, berry bootie challenge.  Is that my soul?  Come on, berry bootie.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	They don't want you to be…

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Girl, she ain't getting it.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Betty has soul.

DERRICK BARRY	This is Betty's character that she created.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	What you don't realize is Betty doesn't have a character.  This is just Betty.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah, you really need to find, like, who you are.

KIM CHI	That's not Britney Spears.  I still don't get a sense of who Derrick Barry is as a drag queen, aside from the fact that he does Britney impersonation.  He needs to find ways to take his drag much further.
DERRICK BARRY	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That could be a big problem for Derrick as we move forward, and we're moving forward, honey.  The train's pulling out of the station.

DERRICK BARRY	Oops, I did it again.

SINGER	RuPaul Drag Race.

RUPAUL	The winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race" receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $,.  With extra special guest judges, Lucian Piane, and Blondie, Chris Stein and Debbie Harry.

SINGER	RuPaul Drag Race.  May the best woman.  Best woman win.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Hey, everyone.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Walk into the room purse first.  Purse first.  Purse first.  Purse first.  Ah, walk into the room purse first.  Clack!

ALL	Ooh!

RUPAUL	Ooh, girl, she done already done had herses.  Hey, rock lobsters.

ALL	Hey!

RUPAUL	One way or another, you've got to rock the Casbah, and when the tide is high, girl, I know what boys like.  Boys like me (giggles).

THORGY THOR	What?

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

RUPAUL	Now long before I became supermodel of the world, I was in a punk rock band called Wee Wee Pole.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

ROBBIE TURNER	Ha-ha!

RUPAUL	I was inspired by bands like the B-s…

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah!

RUPAUL	Wendy O. Williams…

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo!

RUPAUL	And my all-time favorite…Blondie.

ROBBIE TURNER	Yes!

RUPAUL	Now for this week's Maxi Challenge, you're going to form your own new wave band.

RUPAUL	#NewWaveQueens.

NAOMI SMALLS	Hey.

RUPAUL	Working in teams of three, you'll be writing lyrics to original retro tracks.  You need to create a unique style using clothes, shoes, and accessories provided by Out of the Closet thrift stores.  And tomorrow, in front of an audience of groupies, you'll be performing live.  Now I'm gonna let you all form your own band.

RUPAUL	Anarchy!

KIM CHI	I love these bitches.  This is our team.  Team Best Friend Race.

THORGY THOR	You want to do New York?

DERRICK BARRY	Oh.

THORGY THOR	Yeah!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Team New York.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Us three?

KIM CHI	The third team just seems like leftovers just formed together.

RUPAUL	Now there are three different tracks: punk, synth, and party, and I'll let you guys figure out who gets what.  And on the runway, the category is neon realness.

RUPAUL	Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman rock!

ROBBIE TURNER	All right, let's make a case.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	We want punk.

NAOMI SMALLS	Kim, Robbie, and I choose punk because we don't want to give the judges something they've seen before.  We want to really rough it up.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	We want party.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	And we also want party.

ACID BETTY	We also want party.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Okay, let's everyone in their group individually say what you want.

THORGY THOR	I definitely, definitely want party.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Party.

ACID BETTY	Party.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Party.  And what do you guys want in your group.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Party.

DERRICK BARRY	I want party.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Synth.  'Cause it has soul, it has rhythm.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	See, and I felt like that about this.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Now I will say this group is unanimous on party, and you guys are not unanimous on party.

THORGY THOR	Oops! (laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There's, like, this turmoil between Chi Chi and his group, so we kind of, like, pit them against each other.

ACID BETTY	I just don't want you guys to fight.  I don't want Chi Chi to be upset.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I genuinely don't think that your group will be as strong with this 'cause you were like, "I want synth."  You got to turn 'em against themselves.  (evil laughs) (coughs) Just get some water.  So what are you guys thinking?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	We're gonna go with synth, and you guys go with party.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	All right.  Thank you so much.

NAYSHA LOPEZ		Derrick and I, being team players, decide we're gonna go with synth.  Let's make it work.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Girl, we are art.

DERRICK BARRY	That's fine.  You can be art.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Art, art, art, art, art.  Art, art, shekat-kat-boom.  Oh, shika-kat-kat-ki-kat.  Art, did somebody mention art?

DERRICK BARRY	I hope that's not their song.  If that's their song, that sucks.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	I got an idea.  What we do is we incorporate shapes.  I'm circle, you're triangle, and you're square.

DERRICK BARRY	That's cool.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	We can even be The Shapes.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I think our costumes should be that shape, you know what I mean?  Like, cardboard cut-out geometric shapes.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yeah, no.


CHI CHI DEVAYNE	We should just be, like, this is our head, this is our hands.

DERRICK BARRY	I don't want to come out in a box.  I'm not surprised Chi Chi came up with this concept.  This is, like, a girl that shops at Michael's for every outfit that she owns.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Just thought we'd come on stage dressed like a square, a circle, and a triangle.  To me, that would be more visually appealing. 

NAYSHA LOPEZ	No.	

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Naysha's already gone home once.  Derrick just got clocked by the judges, and I sure in hell don't want Michelle calling me basic again.  We all need to step our game up.

ACID BETTY	I don't want to help you guys, but the genre in which you guys are doing of synth was all about geometrical shapes, oddness.  Kaossonome was, like--he was a walking triangle.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	But, I mean, we can be fashionistas.  That's fine.

DERRICK BARRY	If you could show me something that's not a cardboard box on my body then I want to see it.

ACID BETTY	I'm with Chi Chi.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Acid Betty, seriously?  Shut the (bleep) up.  And you're the oldest one in the bunch, you should know better.  Thanks, Betty.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thorgy, is that not funny?

THORGY THOR	No.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thorgy is driving me crazy.  Do you not see yourself all over the song?

THORGY THOR	Ooh.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

KIM CHI	We have to make it funny.

ROBBIE TURNER	Right, absolutely.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah.

ROBBIE TURNER	This week's Maxi Challenge is to form new wave bands.  We have to write lyrics and perform our track live.

KIM CHI	What if we just wrote something, like, just completely, like off the cuff.  Like, I don't know, chicken wings.

ROBBIE TURNER	Yeah, it could be our thing.

KIM CHI	That could be cute.

DERRICK BARRY	The other team, like, I don't--Kim Chi and Robbie as punk?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	When I look at Kim Chi, Robbie, and Naomi, I sure as hell don't see no punk.

ROBBIE TURNER	And then chicken wing.  Maybe our song is, like, something hot and spicy.

NAOMI SMALLS	Like a sauce name.

KIM CHI	Louisiana's finest. 

ROBBIE TURNER	Barbeque.

DERRICK BARRY	You're a punk group, and you're gonna scream about chicken wings and dipping sauces?

KIM CHI	Let's go chicken wings.

ROBBIE TURNER	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	Nothing about this is finger-licking good.  That group is gonna lose.  Like a Stepford Wife, your fantasy.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Or why don't you say, "I'm not a Stepford Wife."

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, that's good.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	I'm, like, really excited about this.

DERRICK BARRY	Well, Chi Chi will help us soul this up, too.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yeah.

DERRICK BARRY	I feel like Chi Chi doesn't really want to be in our group.  His energy is really off.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I know y'all want to work together, but I have, like, no look for neon couture, so could I, like, go over and cutout something real quick?

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, Lord.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	She wore her neon last week.

DERRICK BARRY	Are you serious?  Well, that sucks (sighs).

NAYSHA LOPEZ	You could be square, now, just don't be a nun.  Chi Chi, how did that sound?  Chi Chi, were you listening, or no?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It was good.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah, I think that's cool.  And if he doesn't like it, he can change it.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Girl, it's a group challenge.  Engage because that's what you do when you're on a team.

DERRICK BARRY	Where did Chi Chi go?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	So I'm working on my runway outfit because these bitches have fabulous costumes, and I'm gonna walk out in a neon bathing suit.  So if it seems like I'm a little worried, I am.  And that's why I'm quiet.  I'm distancing myself from the girls, but you know what?  I'ma work this (bleep) out.  Peace.

THORGY THOR	All right, let's keep writing.  How about the first line is what's that smell?

ACID BETTY	Hm, love it.

THORGY THOR	'Cause we're singing about street meat.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.

THORGY THOR	It's quicker.

ACID BETTY	You like to explain it.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah.

ACID BETTY	When we go "Yes," you don't have to convince us.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	And we just laugh because you're--you…

THORGY THOR	I just…

ACID BETTY	'Cause we go like this, "Yeah," and you go, "It's so much simple, and, you know, I thought about it, and you go like this.  And there's a four-count, and a four-count are so much better than a three-count."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah.  You're not the most time-efficient.

THORGY THOR	I'm very detail-oriented and neurotic.  My process is, like, I sit there and examine every little tiny thing, tear it all apart, and put it back together.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	This is where the big black beans could come in.  You see what I mean?

THORGY THOR	No.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thorgy, is that not funny?  Come on, that is…

THORGY THOR	Uh, no, I don't think it's funny.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	What?

THORGY THOR	(groans)


BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	What sets me off is this sound (groans).

THORGY THOR	(groans)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ugh.

THORGY THOR	Ugh.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(groans)

THORGY THOR	(groans)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, my god.  You got to stop with, "Ugh."

THORGY THOR	I really don't mean it that way.  I have an ear for music, rhythm, and, like, beats.  I'm a professionally trained violinist, violist, and cellist, so, like, I have a very critical ear.  Don't argue with me.  I just wish you would trust me when I say, like, a suggestion.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	We do trust you.  Do you not see yourself all over the song?

ACID BETTY	We do.

THORGY THOR	All right, now I know that I can't even speak without being attacked.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No, that's not true.  Thorgy--Thorgy is driving me crazy.  She's not contributing as much as she's negating.

THORGY THOR	I'm actually holding back, like, % of, like, what I actually want to say.

KIM CHI	Thorgy, I really love this drape-y fabric on you.

THORGY THOR	Thank you so much.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, and then the other group's trying to sneak in and break down our defenses.

NAOMI SMALLS	Is it an actual cardigan.

THORGY THOR	Just a simple scarf.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thorgy, you are so easily distracted.  Oh, my god.  And they're looking for the easiest chink in our armor, and it's Thorgy.
KIM CHI	Thorgy, hi.

THORGY THOR	Hey.  They keep changing my lyrics.  My lyrics are so good, and they're like, "Let's change it to this," which is, like, idiotic…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thorgy, stop talking to them!  Jesus (laughs).  I'm just over it.  Whose team are you on?  Like, are you working with the chicken wings or whatever their (bleep) names are?

ROBBIE TURNER	You guys are so fun.  Like, that's hilarious.  Team New York is in a small, little boat, and it's got a hole, and it's sinking.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I really think you're trying to, like, destroy the process almost.

THORGY THOR	I'm really not.

ACID BETTY	Now you're being dramatic, Bob.

THORGY THOR	Yes!  Thank you!  He's being so dramatic!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I didn't know I was with two coo-coo birds.

ROBBIE TURNER	Those bitches are going down.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

LUCIAN	Right now it's just reading as, like, cheesy.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I just don't know what you're saying. 

LUCIAN	You don't understand what I'm saying? 

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No.  I think I may have just, like, cost us this challenge.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	laughs)

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Hi.

LUCIAN	Hi, ladies.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Ru hooked us up with a Lucian rehearsal for this challenge, and my team is up first.

LUCIAN	Let's go ahead and see what you've put together so far.

DERRICK BARRY	There's a lot of pressure on me for this challenge because the judges weren't crazy about my performance last week, and I feel like this character is gonna show them that I do have soul.

LUCIAN	Here we go.  Cue music.

ALL	We are the girls of geometry.

DERRICK BARRY	I'm not a Stepford Wife, I'm your fantasy…

LUCIAN	Whoa.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	(bad vocalizing) Derrick.  (laughs) Just stop.

LUCIAN	That--that's good, but I feel like it might be fun for you guys to maybe talk-sing some of it because you're not, like, incredible vocalists.  Um, okay, let's try that.  Cue track.

ALL	We are the girls of geometry.  Shapes and sizes is what we bring.

LUCIAN	Stop.  Stop for a second.  You're still singing.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh.

LUCIAN	And we were just talking about talking instead.

DERRICK BARRY	Okay.  Talk.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's, "We are the girls of ge-om-et-ry."

LUCIAN	Yeah, more like a rap.  Derrick, you--you…

DERRICK BARRY	I would rather sing.  I want to be a pop star of drag, and I feel like now that I'm given the singing challenge, this is my time to put everything out there.

LUCIAN	Okay, so, let's try it once more time.

DERRICK BARRY	Really want me, it's so plain to see.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Rectangle girls of the world.

LUCIAN	Yeah.  You're getting what I'm saying. 

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Kind of catching on.

LUCIAN	That's awesome.  It's my advice that you two listen to Chi Chi.  She really gets what I'm saying in terms of the arrangement.  I really appreciate that you, like, already in one take did kind of what I was saying, so…it's really cool.

DERRICK BARRY	Ugh.

ALL	Hey, bone collectors, we're Les Chicken Wings, and we've got a bone to pick with you.  Think you're hot, but you're not.  Think you're turned, you're just burnt.

LUCIAN	All right, the biggest thing is to figure out that punk attitude.

KIM CHI	Yeah.

LUCIAN	So when you perform this, it's gonna have to be times ten of what you're doing right now.

ROBBIE TURNER	Right.

LUCIAN	So I want to hear a little anger.  I'm gonna have each of you give me, like, a loud, primal scream.

ROBBIE TURNER	Oh, boy.

LUCIAN	Naomi, you first.

NAOMI SMALLS	Okay (screams).

LUCIAN	You're smiling.  You're so happy.  Come on, anger.  Kim Chi?

KIM CHI	(screams)

LUCIAN	Robbie?

ROBBIE TURNER	(screams)

LUCIAN	Somebody just snatched your wig, tripped you, and stole all your heels.  It still feels like you're scared to, like, let it out.

ROBBIE TURNER	So we're trying to be punk and angst-y, but it was not working, and I'm feeling the pressure.  I have been on the bottom of the game, so I need this win more than anybody else in this competition.

LUCIAN	Hello.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	How are you?

LUCIAN	How are you feeling song-wise, lyrics and everything?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I love it, anyway.

THORGY THOR	It's good.  It's good.

LUCIAN	What's wrong?

THORGY THOR	We love it.

ACID BETTY	(laughs)

LUCIAN	So wait, you're not all on the same page with it?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	We are on the same page.

THORGY THOR	We are.  We are.  We are.  We are.  We are.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thorgy just talks like that.

ACID BETTY	We are, but she's, like…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That's how she talks.

ACID BETTY	Literally nit-picking.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	But we have a final product that we're all happy with.

THORGY THOR	We're good.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Churl, I'm just over it.  I can't argue with Thorgy anymore.

THORGY THOR	I'm really--I'm happy.

LUCIAN	All right.  Here we go.  Cue track.

THORGY THOR	What's that smell?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	We got something to sell.  It's called street meat.  You can shop around the prices can't be beat.

THORGY THOR	Ow!

LUCIAN	The only thing I would say is that it was very character-y and almost theatrical instead of cool, 's, new wave vibe.  All right.  Cue music.

ALL	It's called street meat.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

THORGY THOR	No need to yell.


LUCIAN	All right, all right.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  So this is what I'm talking about.  You're saying it exactly the way you'd say it in a musical.  What's that smell?  That sort of doesn't have the cool, B-s' vibe.  Right now it's just reading as, like, cheesy, and you're just like, "Ehh."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I think the B-s are kind of cheesy.

LUCIAN	The B-s are just one example of a party band.  I'm just trying to direct you to be more cool because that's what this era was about.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That's how they sound to me.  What do you mean by "more cool"?  I don't get that feel from our track.  Am I alone in this?  Really?  No one?

ACID BETTY	Girl, you got to listen.  Open the ears, close the mouth.  He's telling us to lay back, stop be so, "Hey, girl, yeah, whoo, yeah!"

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I just don't know what you're saying, Lucian, baby.  I just don't.

LUCIAN	You don't understand what I'm saying?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No.

LUCIAN	It's just about creating your own style.  Like, even someone like Lorde.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I hate her.  I can't with her.

LUCIAN	Okay.  Well--I'm just telling you, she has her style.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	When you think of Lorde, I think of, like, apathetic teenager.  Av--Ooh.

LUCIAN	I'm just trying to help you.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I guess so I'll be Lorde.

LUCIAN	It's very surprising that any queen would come for me because I'm gonna be judging these bitches.  I'm not saying to be Lorde.  I'm not saying to be the B-s, but it can be some other sort of melody that is your thing.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's like, "You're not the B-s, but how would B-s say it?"  Is what it sounds like to me.

THORGY THOR	Oh, my god.  You are embarrassing us in front of a judge.  If we're in the bottom, Bob is going home, not me.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I know I shouldn't be arguing with Lucian.  I know I shouldn't be, but I'm already in argument-mode because Thorgy has got me at the very edge of the cliff.  Lucian's just an innocent bystander.  I think I may have just, like, cost us this challenge.

KIM CHI	Drag is not a cheap profession.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's really not.

KIM CHI	We all have to do what we gotta do for our coin.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I know.  You got to do what you got to do to live.

KIM CHI	Do you have enough to, like, live off of?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	We were always fortunate kids, but we didn't have a lot of money growing up.  So when I got out of high school, I started getting all these loans and just started trying to find money.

KIM CHI	Yeah.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	And now I'm going through a bankruptcy.

KIM CHI	Wow.  How much is your debt?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's, like, in the tens of thousands.  I work two jobs washing cars and checking out people's groceries.  Being broke is a hurting feeling.  People say they don't have a dime to their name, but when you literally don't have a dime, you taking all your (bleep) to the Coinstar to, like--just to get $., like, I don't think these girls understand that.  Not having the money to buy fabric and all that kind of stuff, I just use what I got, and that's where I find myself saying, "Oh, I'm here for the $,," you know what I mean?

KIM CHI	Yeah.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	When I want to be here for the experience, but in the back of my mind, I just feel like I need money, and it's not all about money all the time.  That's exactly why the stakes in this competition is so high to me.  It's not an option for me to fail.

THORGY THOR	I'm gonna put my hair up and do my makeup, like, immediately.

ROBBIE TURNER	Yeah, I am, too.

THORGY THOR	I'm always, like, the last person running around with my head cut off.

ROBBIE TURNER	And yet you still win.  Every time.

THORGY THOR	I've never won.

ROBBIE TURNER	Frida Kahlo got a special mention.

THORGY THOR	Yeah, a special mention…

ROBBIE TURNER	That was winning.

THORGY THOR	That I was good at the dance challenge but didn't win, but I was top, and then we did the acting challenge, and I was, like--they were like, "You were really good, but…"

ROBBIE TURNER	Yup.

THORGY THOR	I feel like I'm the Susan Lucci.

ROBBIE TURNER	(gasps) Come on.  Susan?

THORGY THOR	I'm the Susan Lucci of the season.  I nailed the "Empire" acting Challenge, and I was safe.  Bob wore literally a $ Halloween costume that was falling apart, and she won.  And, like, Bob is funny, but so am I.  I'm just not as loud and annoying.  They were like, "You were so wonderful.  You floored us.  We couldn't stop watching you.  Bob, you win."

ROBBIE TURNER	It seems like Bob and Thorgy are in a competition of their own, and somebody's feelings are inevitably going to get hurt.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

ALL	We are street meats.

CHRIS	This is epic.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

SINGER	Cover Girl, put the bass in your walk.  Head to toe, let your whole body talk.  And, what?

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "RuPaul's Drag Race."  Michelle Visage, are you ready to get punked?

MICHELLE	I am indeed.

RUPAUL	And Lucian Piane, did my girls rock your world?

LUCIAN	They did, Ru.

RUPAUL	And the co-founder of Blondie, Chris Stein.  I hear you're a fan of the show.

CHRIS	I watch everything religiously.

RUPAUL	(laughs) And I must be dreaming.  It's the legendary Debbie Harry.

DEBBIE	So happy to be here.

RUPAUL	I'm always touched by your presence, dear.

DEBBIE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	This week, we challenged our queens to form new wave groups and perform original songs in front of a live audience.  Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.

RUPAUL	Welcome to She-BGB's.  Hitting the stage, it's Street Meatz.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	What's that smell?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	We got something to sell.

ALL	It's called street meat.

ACID BETTY	No need to yell.  With your wife on vacation.  No need for a reservation.  Hey, you're just in luck.  'Cause we'll quench your thirst.

ALL	And we'll fill you up.  We are street meat.  Savory and sweet.  Sold on the street.  Shop around, our prices can't be beat.

ACID BETTY	(yells)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	When you leave the club.

ACID BETTY	Or a New York bar.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You got an appetite.  And you see our rocket car.

ACID BETTY	Ah.

THORGY THOR	Order three or four.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Or even more.

ACID BETTY	Whoa!

ALL	A line down the block.  We're serving big black.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Beans.

ALL	We are street meat.  Savory and sweet.  Sold on the street.  Shop around, our prices can't be beat.

RUPAUL	Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Dragometry.

ALL	We are the girls Dragometry.  All shapes and sizes are what we bring.  Rectangle girls of the world.

NAYSHA LOPEZ		I'm every girl in a circle I run.  You could be square hun, but don't be a nun.

ALL	We just want to celebrate.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Rectangle girls of the world.

ALL	No matter the size, no matter the shape.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	You may be shaped like a bumblebee.  But you're beautiful, girl, just love your body.

ALL	Rectangle girls of the world.

DERRICK BARRY	You want to be seen like a girl on TV.  I'm not a Stepford Wife, I'm your fantasy.

ALL	Rectangle girls of the world.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	We brought it, girl.  Yeah, we won't give you lies.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm straight to the point and I'm sharp as a knife.

DERRICK BARRY	Get out of the box, don't be so uptight.

ALL	Rectangle girls of the world.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Thank you, thank you.  Be different.  Love yourself.

RUPAUL	Lick your fingers and put your hands together for Les Chicken Wings.

ROBBIE TURNER	Are you guys ready to rock?

ROBBIE TURNER	Hey, bone collectors.  We're Les Chicken Wings.

ALL	And we got a bone to pick with you.

ROBBIE TURNER	That's Honey Dijon.

NAOMI SMALLS	That's Honey Habanero.

KIM CHI	That's Honey Mustard.

ROBBIE TURNER	I just want you to be hot and saucy.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

ROBBIE TURNER	All you ever gave was.

KIM CHI	Bitch or bossy!

ALL	I'm a drag queen, you're a piece of trash.  I don't need you, just leave some cash.

ROBBIE TURNER	Now get out before your face gets a smash.  Yeah!

KIM CHI	I was ready for some hot and crispy.  All you ever said was…

NAOMI SMALLS	Girl you're lisping!

ROBBIE TURNER	You can say good-bye, leave me to cry.  Suck my balls dry, nibble on my thigh.

KIM CHI	Said you liked the leg.

ALL	But that's all a lie

NAOMI SMALLS	I was craving you to be thick and meaty.  In the bedroom you said.

ROBBIE TURNER	You're young and needy.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thought you were it, but you're just really bad.

ROBBIE TURNER	Sad.

KIM CHI	(screams) Mad.

ROBBIE TURNER	Buy our vinyl in the back!

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Coming up…

CHRIS	This thing is mind-blowing.

MICHELLE	What concerns me is the attitude a little bit.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Category is: Neon Queen Realness.  Derrick Barry, heart of glass, ass of silicone.

DEBBIE	She could swim in that.

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez.  In case you didn't know, I was a Lopez.

MICHELLE	Now you know.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.  Chi Chi DeVayne from the Bayou Country.  Whip it good.

MICHELLE	Uuh.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi.

DEBBIE	I love cabbage.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Yes.  Me, too.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turner.  I don't know nothing about birthing no babies.  Naomi Smalls.  Honey, she is serving Billy Jean Queen.
MICHELLE	Yum.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty.


CHRIS	Nosferatu goes to Ferrucci.

RUPAUL	Bring back my gills.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor, thoroughly modern Thorgy.

MICHELLE	Yeah.

DEBBIE	Absolutely.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen, not to be confused with Bob the cable guy.  Bob, how's your head?

LUCIAN	No complaints.

RUPAUL	Welcome, ladies.  I've made some decisions.

RUPAUL	Les Chicken Wings, the crowd ate you up, but one of you was finger-licking great.  Robbie Turnt-her, condragulations, you are the winner of this week's challenge.

ROBBIE TURNER	Yes.

RUPAUL	You'll receive a wig wardrobe from Weaven Steven.

ROBBIE TURNER	This is, like, so huge to me that you're in the room, Ms. Debbie Harry.  Like, I have a poster that was above my bed, and my parents really thought I was straight for a minute.
DEBBIE	You mean I was a beard?

RUPAUL	The three of you may leave the stage.  Now it's time for the judge's critiques.  First up, Bob The Drag 	ueen.
LUCIAN	Hi, Bob.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Hi, Lucian.  Can I just say before we get started, yesterday, I wasn't the kindest to you, and that's not me, and I apologize.

RUPAUL	What was going on?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I wasn't really understanding the references he was giving me.  Then I was like, "Well, I don't even like that artist."

RUPAUL	Who was the artist?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It was Lorde.

RUPAUL	Oh, well, you're in luck.  She's our guest judge next week.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

LUCIAN	Well, I accept your apology, and, today, I was impressed, especially with the black beans line.  I really highlighted your character.  Great job.

MICHELLE	I think ratchet drag is your thing, but I am in love with the way you look tonight.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

MICHELLE	It's in the step in the fashion direction.  Less ratchet, more fashion.

CHRIS	But you have to stay professional at all times, no matter how pissed off you are.

RUPAUL	Next up, hey there, Thorgy girl.

MICHELLE	I'm not crazy about this look tonight.  This is going on.  This is going on.  This is going on.  This is--there's just so much that I'm losing you.

LUCIAN	But you slayed it in the performance.  You kept drawing my attention.

RUPAUL	Next up, Acid Betty.

CHRIS	This thing is mind-blowing.  This is epic.

DEBBIE	I mean, did you actually make that wig yourself?

ACID BETTY	I made everything you see but the shoes, yeah. 

DEBBIE	Wow.  Very good.

MICHELLE	Until you came out in that challenge, I got more Patty Duke than I did Acid Betty.  I didn't get why everybody else kind of went crazy new wave, and you went 's.  It made me feel that you weren't in your element for the first time.

ACID BETTY	Oh, okay.  I totally felt like I was, so that's weird that you felt that way.

RUPAUL	Up next, Hey, Derrick.

MICHELLE	Your makeup made me so happy.  I did not see a trace of she-who-shall-not-be-named.

DERRICK BARRY	Yes.

MICHELLE	Tonight on the runway, do you look pretty?  Yes, but I'm still waiting for that breakthrough.

CHRIS	I'm hearing Britney Spears a lot, but I--when I saw you with the bangs I thought you could do Debbie.  Maybe you should audition for the movie.

RUPAUL	Oh.

DERRICK BARRY	Wow.  Call my agent.

DEBBIE	Well, you have a terrific voice.

DERRICK BARRY	Thank you.

LUCIAN	But you were kind of, like, disappointing as a performer.  I don't know what's happening in your head because you're not giving us %.

RUPAUL	All right, next up, Naysha Lopez. 

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Hi, Ru.	

RUPAUL	Tell me about this outfit.  It feels like it's painted on you.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yeah.  It's actually all airbrushed.

RUPAUL	And more to the point, your ass is real?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yes.  It's real.

RUPAUL	You got it from your Mama.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	And my daddy.

RUPAUL	Does your daddy deal in medical-grade silicone?

MICHELLE	This is fun.  I think this is something different for you (chuckles).  Now the outfit in the group, it was like part Dolly Parton, and then the circle that wasn't really a circle.

RUPAUL	In terms of the outfit in your group, were you in charge of that?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	It was a group challenge, so we really participated with everything when it--you know…

RUPAUL	Well, Chi Chi's shaking her head.  You're saying it was not a group effort?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	No, the thing Thorgy had on her head, that's what I wanted to wear as the actual costume.

RUPAUL	I see.

DERRICK BARRY	I'm not gonna be in a cardboard box.  Absolutely not.

RUPAUL	Is this the first you all are hearing any dissention from Chi Chi?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	She was just disconnected.

RUPAUL	I see.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	You know, like, it was, like, "Hey, Chi Chi, "you want to come over here really quick?  You know, we're gonna look at some references," and it's like, "All right.  Whatever."

RUPAUL	Well, they was…

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I was told to step my drag up, and that's what I wanted to do.

MICHELLE	So tell me why you're out here in a bathing suit with no corset and a belt.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I don't have the expenses to pay for something like this.  I'm in a bankruptcy.  I just don't have…

MICHELLE	Hold on.  You don't need money, girl.  That's never an excuse.  I know you can turn a show.  What concerns me is the attitude a little bit.  I'm getting the feeling that you have fought very hard to be where you are.  I get it, but we're lifting you up.  Let us.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I hear you.  I'm sorry, y'all, that, you know, I just kind of halfed it, and…

NAYSHA LOPEZ	No, no, it's okay.  It's cool, sister.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I don't want y'all to feel like that, you know, I tried to throw y'all under the bus or anything, but…

RUPAUL	What is this bus everybody keeps talking about?

RUPAUL	Is the bus still running?

RUPAUL	Thank you, ladies.  While you un-tuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.

RUPAUL	All right, now just between us Sunday girls, what do you think?  Let's start with Bob The Drag Queen.

LUCIAN	Bob was giving me a little attitude, but this is a high-pressure competition.

RUPAUL	Absolutely.

LUCIAN	And I think personality things that they may not even like in themselves sometimes come out.

DEBBIE	And Bob did stand out.  Bob has a lot of charisma and seems to know who he is. 

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

LUCIAN	She delivered on this challenge.  There's just something so quirky about her.

CHRIS	I agree.  I was totally drawn to her.

RUPAUL	Michelle, you had an issue with her outfit.

MICHELLE	There was just so much going on.

RUPAUL	Did she paint sideburns on? 

MICHELLE	Down her cheekbones and around her jawline, down her neck, and down her arms.

RUPAUL	I think her challenge in this competition is to edit it down.  Acid Betty.

CHRIS	You know, I watch this show all the time, and I was kind of waiting for this "Wow" moment, and that was Betty's runway.

MICHELLE	But her outfit in the performance just was not cohesive for me, and because of it, she was completely swallowed up by those other two girls.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	Most frustrating thing, for me, is how temporary Derrick is in performing.  And she's so not used to performing something other than Britney.

DEBBIE	But she, you know, really had an outstanding voice.

MICHELLE	But it's hard to judge her as her, because Ru, think about Chad Michaels.

RUPAUL	Mm-hmm.

MICHELLE	She can do tons of other drag than Cher.  Derrick has to find a way to break through that mold.

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez.

CHRIS	I kind of lost her in the performance to the other two.

RUPAUL	Now she was eliminated, and we brought Naysha back.

LUCIAN	She wants to be here so bad, I can tell.


RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

LUCIAN	She's trying so hard, but I don't know if she is giving us enough.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne.

LUCIAN	In the performance, she was the standout for me.

DEBBIE	She does have this mysterious magnetic quality.

MICHELLE	On the runway, however, there's no excuse for you to come out here being that basic.  No.

CHRIS	I watch this show all the time, and you cannot wear the same shoes for the challenge and the runway.  I'm sorry.

MICHELLE	Thank you.

LUCIAN	That's amazing.

RUPAUL	Silence.  I've made my decision.  Bring back my girls.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Welcome back, ladies.  Based on your new wave performances and your main stage presentations, I've made some decisions.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen, you're safe.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor, you're safe.

THORGY THOR	(whispers) Thank you.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty, your runway look was a bright spot, but in the challenge, you were overshadowed.  You're safe.

ACID BETTY	Oh.  I'm Jewish, but I'm praying to all the gods, so thank you (laughs).

RUPAUL	Mishpocheh, you may join the other girls.  Derrick Barry, you didn't quite ace your Dragometry test.  Naysha Lopez, in neon, you are radioactive, but your performance was not electrifying.  Chi Chi DeVayne, your runway ouch-fit didn't dominate.  Derrick Barry…You're safe.


DERRICK BARRY	Thank you.

RUPAUL	You may join the other girls.

ACID BETTY	Wow.  Depp breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath.

RUPAUL	Naysha and Chi Chi, I'm sorry, my dears, but you are both up for elimination.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Seriously?  Again?  What the (bleep)?  There's just no way that I'm gonna go home again.

RUPAUL	Two queens stand before me.  Prior to tonight, you were asked to prepare a lip-synch performance of "Call Me" by Blondie.  Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination.  The time has come…

RUPAUL	…for you to lip-sync for…your…life.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	The only thing that keeps going in my mind is, "Girl, hustle.  Make it work."  I'm gonna lip-sync for my (bleep) life.

RUPAUL	Good luck, and don't (bleep) it up.

SINGER	Color me your color, baby.  Color me your car.  Color me your color, darling.  I know who you are.  Come up off your color chart.  I know where you're coming from.  Call me.  Call me.  On the line, call me.  Call me any anytime.

RUPAUL	Ow!

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Naysha is flipping out tricks and flips that I had no idea she had.  Chi Chi better beware.

SINGER	Share the wine.  Call me.  Call me.  On the line.


ROBBIE TURNER	Oh, my god.  Chi Chi just went in for the kill…

RUPAUL	Oh!

ROBBIE TURNER	And when I say kill, I mean there was blood everywhere.

LUCIAN	Whoo!  Whoo!

MICHELLE	Yeah!

SINGER	Call me.  Call me.  My love.  Call me, call me any anytime.  Call me.  Call me.  On the line.  Call me, call me any anytime.  Call me.  Call me.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Ladies, I've made my decision.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne, shantay, you stay.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Thank you so much.

RUPAUL	You may join the other girls.

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez, your beauty and your bootie did double-duty this season.  Now sashay away.

LUCIAN	Bye, Naysha.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Bye.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	I was giving it %, and am I a little upset that someone that's giving % and not committed at all is still here?  Yeah, absolutely.  I want to tell the girls, "Stop your (bleep) complaining."  Get your (bleep) together, and don't forget, Ru has me on speed dial."  So you just never know (chuckles).

RUPAUL	Condragulations, ladies.  And remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?  Can I get a amen in here?

ALL	Amen.

RUPAUL	All right.  Now let the music play.

SINGER	Die tomorrow, live tonight.  Die tomorrow, live tonight.  Die tomorrow, live tonight.
