(THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL)











NARRATOR)
Far-far away in the south of The Heavenly Empire…
NARRATOR) (CONT’D)
there lived the Great Dragon.
NARRATOR)
His eyelashes went down deep into the ground and came back up…
NARRATOR) (CONT’D)
as beautiful plants healing the souls and bodies of those who suffered.
NARRATOR) (VO)
People called the leaves of this plant “tea”.
NARRATOR) 
The glory of this drink spread far and wide.
NARRATOR) 
Soon, the Great Dragon found men to take care of his eyelashes…
NARRATOR) (CONT’D)
and preserve the healing properties of tea.
NARRATOR) 
They were called "The White Wizards".
NARRATOR) 
The Great Dragon made a magical seal and gave it to the wizards he trusted the most:
NARRATOR) (CONT’D)
the Master, his daughter and the Princess.

NARRATOR)
Merchants from all over the world traded great riches for this tea.
NARRATOR)
But then, some of the wizards got greedy.
NARRATOR)
They went to the evil side to control the Dragon.
NARRATOR)
These Black Wizards were led by the Two-Faced Witch.
NARRATOR)
She raised an ancient army…
NARRATOR) (CONT’D)
and they took the Dragon's cave.
NARRATOR)
To get more tea, they stopped trimming the Great Dragon's eyelashes.
NARRATOR)
His eyes became heavy and he fell into a deep sleep.
NARRATOR)
The White Wizards fought back to free the Great Dragon…
NARRATOR) (CONT’D)
but the Black Wizards were too powerful.
NARRATOR)
The evil forces captured The Master and the Princess.
NARRATOR)
They then put them into prisons on opposite sides of the world.

England. Tower of London




GUARD)
Feeding time, you lazy maggots!
GUARD)
We should hang the half of you lot! Hands off!
PRISONER)
That’s not enough for breakfast. Give me that! Give me some food, please!
GUARD)
Sod off! Come late, get nothing!








JAMES HOOK)
One... Two… three! 


JAMES HOOK)
All in attendance!
JAMES HOOK)
Of course you are. Where would you go?


JAMES HOOK) 
It's the Tower! 
PETER THE FIRST)
Years fly but the jokes are still the same…







CELLMATE) 
We'll never escape this place. 



CELLMATE)
But we won’t live long anyway.



PETER THE FIRST)
Hmm?

PETER THE FIRST)
How do you survive if you don't eat anything? 
MASTER)
The sun that rises in the East nourishes me....
CELLMATE)
Give it to me!


PETER THE FIRST)
Little birdie, pretty little birdie.


CELLMATE)
I’ll have water too!





PETER THE FIRST)
God damn it!





CELLMATE)
I will tell you where I’ve hid my treasure
CELLMATE) (CONT’D)
for a tiny piece of this bird. Please, give it to me!


PETER THE FIRST)
Ha! I’ve got you, you white little beauty. 
PETER THE FIRST)
You see how easily I caught him.

MASTER)
That’s a homing pigeon. Not afraid of people.

CELLMATE)
Please give it to me!

PETER THE FIRST)
Yeah! I can see what you mean! 
PETER THE FIRST)
I don't understand... It's... Bloody nonsense!





MASTER)
It's a secret code.
MASTER)
It’s written backwards.
PETER THE FIRST)
Backward?



PETER THE FIRST)
Dear Miss Dudley, I’m missing you immensely…
PETER THE FIRST) (CONT’D)
and every day I recall your silhouette in the moonlight ... 


PETER THE FIRST) 
It looks like it’s somebody's private correspondence...…

PETER THE FIRST)
So, you think we still should read it?
CELLMATE)
Oh yes, we should!
PETER THE FIRST)
So listen. 
PETER THE FIRST) (CONT’D)
“Once again I am apologizing for my sudden departure.”
PETER THE FIRST) 
I would never leave you, Miss Dudley,
PETER THE FIRST) (CONT’D)
if not for the disagreement with your father...

LORD DUDLEY)
Debauching yourself|in your father‘s house,

LORD DUDLEY)(CONT’D)
and with a common teacher! 
JONATHAN GREEN)
I‘m not just a teacher.

JONATHAN GREEN)
I‘m a Bachelor of geography and cartography!
LORD DUDLEY)
Set the dogs on him!

MISS DUDLEY)
Run darling, I love you!

JONATHAN GREEN)
I love you too, darling, believe in me!

PETER THE FIRST)
Your father, Lord Dudley was absolutely right…


JONATHAN GREEN)
Your father, Lord Dudley, was absolutely right. 

JONATHAN GREEN)
I have indeed spent all of my fortune.
JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
I've not wasted it but invested it in my invention. 

JONATHAN GREEN) 
I've managed to produce a revolution in cartography. 

JONATHAN GREEN)
With the help of the fifth wheel of the coach…
JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
I can measure distance precisely.
JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
Meanwhile, the rest of world is still doing it the old fashioned way.… 
JONATHAN GREEN)
My fame reached the Russian Tsar…


JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
who ordered me to map of the borders of his European possessions. 

PETER THE FIRST)
Yes, right! I remember him! The clever scientist! 

PETER THE FIRST)
I met him during my embassy trip to England.

PETER THE FIRST)
"I crossed the whole of Europe..."
JONATHAN GREEN)
I crossed the whole of Europe and after passing over the mountains of gloomy Transylvania…




JONATHAN GREEN) 
I reached the wild forests of Little Russia.
JONATHAN GREEN)
There, I encountered phenomena that cannot be explained by science! 
JONATHAN GREEN) 
It was as if ancient legends and tales
JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
told at night to frighten children came to life before my eyes.

JONATHAN GREEN) 
I saw an ancient creature with countless eyes.


JONATHAN GREEN)
Its name was Viy. 

JONATHAN GREEN)
With a single glance it could read your mind


JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
and know your innermost thoughts. 
JONATHAN GREEN)
The locals, called Cossacks, suddenly turn into strange beasts


JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
during their nightly feasts.

JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
and flying monsters could appear as if from nowhere.


JONATHAN GREEN)
These are the unfathomable adventures, Miss Dudley
JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
that I experienced on my way to Moscow.
JONATHAN GREEN) 
These strange visions still haunt me…

JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
and it seems they shall haunt me as long as I live.

JONATHAN GREEN)
I was certain, dear Miss Dudley...
JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
that a reward from Peter the Great awaited me in Moscow.
JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
But that is not what happened...
JONATHAN GREEN)
I brought the map, as we agreed. 
MENSHIKOV)
Mister Jonathan Green needs no introduction! And I am Sasha Menshikov!
MENSHIKOV)
Alright, follow me!
MENSHIKOV)
Maps are delightful objects. We do appreciate them. 
JONATHAN GREEN)
It's wonderful!

MENSHIKOV)
We've heard about your fifth wheel. An original invention!
MENSHIKOV) (CONT’D)
Such detail!
MENSHIKOV
I've never seen such a detailed map!
DANISH AMBASSADOR)
Oh look! My dear Denmark is here! So small!
 

DUTCH AMBASSADOR)
And this here my dear Holland! So very small as well!



JONATHAN GREEN)
Be careful! My map!
MENSHIKOV)
Everything in Europe is small! 
MENSHIKOV)
Here in Russia, everything is so big! 

IMPOSTOR)
Hear! As the eagle is our national bird...


IMPOSTOR) (CONT’D)
...none may defecate|while in an eagle pose!

JONATHAN GREEN)
I was led to believe that I would have an opportunity to meet him, so where is he?

MENSHIKOV)
What do you mean? Here He is, simply go and meet Him.


IMPOSTOR)
Caw!
JONATHAN GREEN)
That’s not him!

MENSHIKOV)
Are you certain the one you met was Peter? 
JONATHAN GREEN)
Yes!

MENSHIKOV)
The First? 
MENSHIKOV)
The Great?


MENSHIKOV)
Music! Everybody stand up! Dance! Dance now!

JONATHAN GREEN)
I met him at his Embassy. 
JONATHAN GREEN)
The court scientist, Isaac Newton, and myself… Well we saw…

MENSHIKOV)
You were in Europe! How it could have been the Tsar? 

MENSHIKOV)
Guards! Send him to the dungeon! 

JONATHAN GREEN)
My eyes!

PRISON GUARD)
Move, pig! 


JONATHAN GREEN)
My eyes! Agrh! My eyes!




JONATHAN GREEN)
And these, dearest Miss Dudley, are my latest tidings.


JONATHAN GREEN)
This shall also be my final letter to you 

JONATHAN GREEN) (CONT’D)
as I only have a single pigeon left.
PETER THE FIRST)
I suppose, Mr. Green requires my assistance.

PETER THE FIRST)
May I use your feather, Master? 

PETER THE FIRST)
Thank you.

PETER THE FIRST)
This pigeon is our only chance to get out of here.

PETER THE FIRST)
If Miss Dudley loves this Jonathan true,

PETER THE FIRST) (CONT’D)
we can expect to have visitors soon.






MISS DUDLEY)
Now, the long-barreled musket.

LORD DUDLEY)
So, shall we close the book?… 





MISS DUDLEY)
Father!

LORD DUDLEY)
What?

MISS DUDLEY)
Look at this! It's from Jonathan! He's in trouble! 

LORD DUDLEY)
Don’t tell me! From that lunatic scientist of yours, is it?
LORD DUDLEY)
What’s he done now? He’s been taken hostage by a house full of witches? (Laughs)

MISS DUDLEY)
Father, please stop! He is the father of my child! 

LORD DUDLEY)
I hardly need reminding of that.
ELISABETH CHASE)
Please, we want to hear more! 
MISS DUDLEY)
Go and play for a bit!
LORD DUDLEY)
Dearest Miss Dudley! Now I'm coming to Moscow...

MISS DUDLEY)
Now, look at this, it's not Jonathan's handwriting!
LORD DUDLEY)
I, the Great Sovereign, the Tsar of the Great and Small or White Russia,

LORD DUDLEY) (CONT’D)
to the one who reads this message announce
LORD DUDLEY) (CONT’D)
that I am held prisoner in an English dungeon known as Tower Grey Prison. 
LORD DUDLEY) (CONT’D)
I am the one and only rightful ruler of the Russian lands.
LORD DUDLEY) (CONT’D)
Peter the First.
LORD DUDLEY) (CONT’D)
What’s this nonsense about Peter The First being in prison? Is this some secret code of yours, hmm? 

MISS DUDLEY)
I don't understand it myself. 

LORD DUDLEY)
Then that womanizing swindler Baron Charles Whitworth …

LORD DUDLEY) (CONT’D)
in his role as her Majesty’s ambassador…
RD DUDLEY) (CONT’D)
is about to embark on a diplomatic mission to the Russian Tsar.
LORD DUDLEY) (CONT’D)
Get the pigeons ready - they’re going to Moscow immediately!

PRISONER)
All my ancestors had the beards! 




JONATHAN GREEN)
Thank you, boy!

PRISON GUARD)
Give this Chinaman 30 lashes…
PRISON GUARD) (CONT’D)
and then we're sending him off to Siberia!
SOLDIER)
Let’s go!
JONATHAN GREEN)
That's barbarous! Leave him alone! He's just a boy!


PRISON GUARD)
And here is the Englishman! 


HERALD)
By the order of His Majesty, I order you, ignorant peasants,

JONATHAN GREEN)
I am a subject of Her Majesty, the Queen of England.

MENSHIKOV)
Here he is! And, you'll notice, in perfect health! 

MENSHIKOV)
Let him go!

ENGLISH AMBASSADOR)
Jonathan, you are forgiven and fully pardoned.
ENGLISH AMBASSADOR)
Lord Dudley sent you these pigeons.

MENSHIKOV)
I have a great idea! 
MENSHIKOV)
You could go the Far East and chart a new map of our borders.

 
MENSHIKOV)
And listen here, don't even think about running away to Europe! 

ENGLISH AMBASSADOR)
And keep what you see to yourself! 


ENGLISH AMBASSADOR)
It's less trouble.
JONATHAN GREEN)
I'm going East? Then there’s a condition.

JONATHAN GREEN)
I'll need an assistant. I'll take the boy.
MENSHIKOV)
You want this little fool? 
MENSHIKOV)
Did you not hear, you brute? 

MENSHIKOV)
Take him, he is yours! 

JONATHAN GREEN)
Let's get you out of this madness.
JONATHAN GREEN)
Once you’re free of here, you can do what you like.

JONATHAN GREEN)
Over here.
JONATHAN GREEN)
Give me those. 


MENSHIKOV)

MENSHIKOV) (CONT’D)

JONATHAN GREEN)
We gonna have to get out of Moscow as soon as possible. 

JONATHAN GREEN)
I'm going East, but it's a perilous journey.
CHENG LAN)
I owe you my life.

CHENG LAN)
I'm going to the East as well. 
JONATHAN GREEN)
You  know… I awe you. Look, come with me. I need an assistant.

CHENG LAN)
I don’t want to bother you. 
CHENG LAN) (CONT’D)
I’ll travel on top… of this carriage.

JONATHAN GREEN)
On top? Eh, right, well…

JONATHAN GREEN)
Then you need this and… and this.


CHENG LAN)
Thank you!
