DAISY	(Reacting to the shunt) Ow! What did you do that for?! Diesel's face fallsHe was expecting a cheerful reaction!
DIESEL	What?! I was just saying 'hello'! What do you want me to do? Say 'sorry'?!
DAISY	Well, I'm highly sprung!  A bump like that could be bad for my swerves, not to mention my –
DIESEL	'Bye, Daisy!
DAISY	So rude!
DAISY	Oooh! Ohhh!
STORYTELLER	Daisy struggled on after picking up her passengers, but she didn't feel right..and then there was trouble!
DAISY	<GASPS!> Ohhh! 
PASSENGERS	Walla

STORYTELLER	Daisy's springs had finally sprung!
DAISY	This has never happened before!

THOMAS	<COUGH! COUGH! COUGH!> Diesel!
RYAN	Here we are, Daisy!
DEN	Oooh! Look, Dart! A diesel railcar!
DART	What he means is, "Welcome to the Dieselworks!"
DEN	NoI meant, "Look, DartA diesel railcar."
DAISY	My fitter always told me I was one of a kindAnd he warned me to be careful! Not every railcar is so highly sprung
DART	We'll look after you, DaisyDon't you worry!
DAISY	I don't know..this could be..the end of the line pour moi.
DART	Ahhh what she means is...
DEN	I know what she means.
DART	Oh
STORYTELLER	Daisy's springs had never sprung before and the Diesel workers didn't know how to fix them
MAVIS	Den and Dart say she might have to be scrapped.

BERT	<Gasps>.
MAVIS	Poor Daisy!
BERT	'Ey, Diesel'Ave you 'eard about Daisy? She may 'ave swerved 'er last.
DIESEL 	Why are you telling me...? 
STORYTELLER	Everywhere Diesel went engines were talking about Daisy...
PAXTON	Have you heard the news, Diesel? 
DIESEL	Growls 
PAXTON	About Daisy?
DIESEL	Oh! Why, when something bad happens, does everyone always think it's my fault?!
DIESEL	Ohhhh
DIESEL	Just because I gave Daisy a little bump, everyone blames me! Typical!
DEN	Ohh I don't know about you, Dart, but I'm glad I don't have springs!
DART	What you mean is, once your springs have sprung..that's it! Poor Daisy!
DIESEL	Daisy? ...Are you asleep Daisy? 
DIESEL	<sigh> I'm sorry for shunting into you the way I did, DaisyI really didn't mean to cause you any trouble..
DIESEL	...but so what if I did give you a little bump!? Other engines aren't nice to me, so why should I be nice to other engines? And they blame me for EVERYTHING!
DIESEL	But..I hope you can be fixedI wish I could do something to make everything alright again
DIESEL	I like you! <sigh> Although..after this..I don't suppose you'll ever want to be MY friend.

DART	Look, Den! Springs for Daisy!
DEN	Oh Yeah	
DAISY	Woo! I feel good as new! Maybe even better than before!
