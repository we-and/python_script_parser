??	Football is a sacred representation,

??	the last great collective ritual. 

??	Pier Paolo Pasolini said this.

??	He was an impassioned football fan.

??	I wonder if he ever went into an empty stadium. 

??	If he felt the power that this space conveys,  especially on the eve of a great event  like the one that will begin in two days, the European Football Championship. 

??	Our journey together with the national team towards the European Cup  starts up again from October th of last year.

??	They are days in which Italy discovers that is it in the middle of a new Covid wave.

??	Covid doesn't spare anyone, not even the national team players, not even its coach.

??	COVID: ROBERTO MANCINI POSITIVE.

??	DZEKO STOPS TOO.

??	I hope to see you soon.

??	In November Alberico Evani will take over the team and go to the bench in Mancini's place.

??	Patience means that you wait, but I keep moving the ball.

??	It's as if Roberto were here with us.

??	He watches the training live.

??	Ready?

??	Yes, no. I was saying...

??	I was saying that there are four minutes left.

??	Tell him to try coming out with

??	Calabria and El Shaarawy wide here.

??	He participates in the meetings.

??	Boys, today when you do the tactic part... I already talked to the staff.

??	It's important when we begin an action that we're all in our half of the field.

??	So I think even the group feels he is close.

??	I was the first smart working coach in the history of football.

??	The staff will have to think of a sort of cordless phone for communicating during the games.

??	In the grand stand there was Lombardo.

??	Lombardo was connected to Mancini in Rome.

??	So Lombardo communicated with Vialli on the bench, and Vialli gave instructions.

??	In other words, suggestions, to Evani.

??	It's one of those moments when we measure the force of a group, it's compactness.

??	Your duty is that of working as professionals, but also with great pride.

??	Yes!

??	We are going to tell you about an Azzurro dream.

??	Coverciano, the Home of the National Team.

??	This is the factory of our football dreams, sometimes of our triumphs.

??	Grosso against Barthez.

??	And it's goal! It's over! It's over!

??	Bravo!

??	It's over!

??	The sky above Berlin is azure!

??	We are champions of the world!

??	The azure jersey meant having the opportunity of representing, besides my country, and all the Italian fans or all the Italian citizens, it meant also representing all those goalkeepers or aspiring goalkeepers who grew up with the dream and the hope of being able to become the national team's goalkeeper.

??	Well, my memories of Coverciano go back to years ago when for the first time I went past the gate to participate in the Under .

??	Coverciano was completely different.

??	I remember the big rooms and bunk beds where  or  of us slept in the same room that looked like a military barracks room.

??	It's inevitable that since then, I saw the changes that took place in Coverciano.

??	In everything.

??	But I surely remember that period with great affection.

??	I remember the first time, yes.

??	I went past the Coverciano gate with my parents.

??	I found myself sitting at the table with Cannavaro, Buffon, Gattuso,

??	Pirlo, De Rossi...

??	I thought, "I'll do this retreat and who knows when I'll see them again".

??	My first day at Coverciano as a football player I remember this.

??	Four or five of us from Rome were called if I'm not mistaken.

??	We all travelled together from Rome and I was the youngest of them all.

??	It was my first time here and we were late.

??	They were serene with the serenity of who is used to going to Coverciano.

??	I was terrorized because I entered the locker room, the dining room, the meeting room, where there were the idols of Italian football.

??	And I was mortified for having been late my first day.

??	My first day with the national team was an incredible emotion because I was young and we had celebrated at home with the family.

??	When the call comes from the national team, it's always a big emotion.

??	I tried to be as simple as possible,

??	I wanted to be liked, to fit in with the group immediately.

??	I remember the first time that I arrived here.

??	When I entered and realized

??	I was in the sports centre of the Italian national team,

??	I went into my room and called my mom and my dad.

??	I even felt like crying.

??	And I remember when I sat at the table.

??	I was in the central part because I arrived and said, "I'll sit here so nobody will make me get up".

??	And slowly, I climbed the positions until I reached the head of the table.

??	The national team has existed for over  years, and think of the millions and millions of boys who grew up in the hope of becoming professionals, of playing for the Azzurra jersey.

??	And of these millions, only  managed to wear that jersey.

??	So I think it's a reason to be very proud, and therefore, a great honour, but there is also a great duty, because, as you know, it's what we always say, that once you play on the national team you are "Azzurro".

??	And once you are Azzurro, you are that forever. So it's your duty to represent the values of the federation in the field when you play, but also in everyday life.

??	Good! Ale, kick the ball. Perfect.

??	Kick!

??	Move! Move from there!

??	You must come here, Spina. Come on!

??	Come on, go, go!

??	During training we try to resume the tactic training mostly.

??	It allows us to go study a video, with the staff and the coach to be able to capture...

??	Information that can be useful even during the game.

??	For those who will play the game, you must know that it's important because it's points for the ranking

??	If we lost such a match, we'd lose lots of points for the World Cup draw.

??	So we absolutely must remain in the first ten to have a good draw and be top team.

??	It is fundamental to take it seriously, and it won't be a simple game.

??	Good evening.

??	Welcome.

??	October , . The road of the Azzurri towards the European Championship picks up again with a decisive victory over a modest Moldavia.

??	The score is  to .

??	Cristante hits it with his head!

??	Italy is leading!

??	Ciccio Caputo debuting with the national jersey.

??	El Shaarawy!

??	A cross, and scoring his first goal with the national Italian jersey, is also Domenico Berardi.

??	It is a beautiful evening.

??	After the games it's normal to play music. It's logical to play music when you win, because when you lose

??	I don't think it's a good idea to play music.

??	The national team continues winning, but the most delicate match is played outside the field against an invisible enemy that even threatens Coverciano.

??	Right now we are in a bubble that until today we managed to keep sterile.

??	Let's try not to give in now that there is a greater risk.

??	The matter we are talking about is what occurred on the st.

??	As you read, there are two players who are positive, since last night.

??	The team is doing the swab tests again.

??	The alternative solution that was found is that of gathering the under  group tonight in Florence.

??	If the ASL should block the departure of the Under , the Under  will leave for Iceland, and meanwhile we'll do swab tests here.

??	If you don't do the swab test here, you can't get on the plane.

??	Maybe we have the good fortune of being checked, and that is what's most important, also for those around us.

??	Our families know that even if we go around on trains and planes, we are always under control.

??	And that we manage to train and to play, to continue doing our job, something that unfortunately, many can't do at this time.

??	So we live this in a privileged way.

??	Come on! Kick! Kick!

??	Bravo! Go for it!

??	Bravo. I explained it.

??	Don't ever rest assured.

??	The moment is complicated but the show must go on.

??	There are only  days left to prepare for the transfer to Danzig which is decisive for the Nations League.

??	We are going to play against Poland, a team that was able. over the years, to cause us big disappointments.

??	ITALY POLAND

??	June , 

??	As in the World Cup of .

??	Poland defeats Italy  to .

??	Italy leaves the World Cup.

??	But when we think of Italy Poland, we mostly think of the semi-final of the World Championship in Spain

??	ITALY POLAND

??	July , . and the goals of a great champion who recently left us, Pablito Rossi.

??	Goal by Rossi, on Antognoni's free kick.

??	Rossi. Goal! Goal!

??	Rossi doubles!

??	It's the fourth time in the history of football that the Italian team conquers a final in the World Championship.

??	Paolo Rossi in a song by Antonello Venditti is defined as a boy like us.

??	Paolo Rossi was not a super athlete.

??	Paolo Rossi had love handles.

??	Paolo Rossi was a player who seemed absolutely normal when you saw him.

??	But he was talented in a way that cannot be imagined, and a capacity to think of a goal before the others.

??	The free kick, cross by Gentile.

??	ITALY WEST GERMANY

??	July , 

??	Goal! He scored!

??	Rossi! Rossi!

??	Rossi!

??	An enviable technical capacity.

??	The capacity, above all, to send the defenders to the cafe with a fake move, with a look on one side and a movement on the other.

??	ITALY BRAZIL

??	July , 

??	In the first  or  metres, Paolo Rossi was practically impossible to catch.

??	An immense player. I am truly happy to have experienced him as a fan, as a real fan, of having gone out in the street, of having jumped into the fountains, of having won for the first time.

??	I had never won.

??	And the World Championship for an Italian means a lot.

??	Paolo Rossi gets credit for having us go back in the street.

??	Come on! Come on!

??	We begin here at the Arena of Danzig, in the challenge between Poland and Italy.

??	This beautiful and breath-taking stadium that can hold  thousand spectators, today only holds  percent, according to the Uefa norms, applied to Poland, but maybe it's the last event that is open to the public.

??	Poland is dangerous inside the penalty kick area. It's short!

??	And the ball is on the exterior of the net, the optical illusion of a goal, a fortunate detour.

??	The game ends  to , and we are still first in the group of Nations League.

??	But now we must face Holland.

??	After having lost the last game, the Orange will want to win.

??	Come on! Come on! Come on!

??	There are  positive cases of coronavirus in the Under  group.

??	The choice of the Federation to send the Under ...

??	The game against Holland will be played in Bergamo, the symbol city of the first Covid wave.

??	On the eve, Vialli, Mancini and Oriali visit the city cemetery to pay homage to the victims.

??	Being the coach for the national team is a great honour, because you are none-the-less the coach of the national football of a great country like Italy that has a  great past and that is a beautiful nation, despite everything.

??	And being one at this moment, with what happened in Italy, and above all when we went to Bergamo for the game with Holland...

??	We went to the cemetery of Bergamo.

??	Many doctors present at the game had fought against the virus in the past months.

??	It was truly very emotion-filled.

??	We were very sorry not to have a stadium full of people who deserved a moment of joy in watching the national team.

??	So I believe that these are very important moments where you represent an important country.

??	The Italian section starts with the north curve Federico Pisani, and embraces Italy.

??	He'd like the ball served to Barella,

??	Immobile tries to go wide.

??	In the middle, on the opposite side,

??	Pellegrini arrives.

??	Regular position, Pellegrini!

??	Italy is leading!

??	Goal!

??	It was something wonderful because it had a special significance for us, for Bergamo and for Italy.

??	We all know what Bergamo went through with Covid.

??	So we were particularly set on doing well.

??	Furthermore, all those people were watching us and we wanted to show them...

??	We wanted to be close to them, doing what we can do, play football.

??	Libero Blind, regular position, dangerous at the end, in the middle.

??	Depay tries to turn. Depay!

??	The ball ends up at the end.

??	Holland evens the score.

??	In front of the Bergamo spectators, the Azzurri very much wanted to win.

??	Instead, the retreat in October ended up with two draws that cost us the first place in the group of Nations League.

??	It is the first, real setback of the Mancini management, perhaps due to the complicated moment.

??	Easy! Easy!

??	In November, during the full wave of Covid, the national team meets in Coverciano again to play another  games.

??	But on the eve of the retreat, the news nobody was expecting, arrived.

??	AT HOME WITHOUT SYMPTOMS

??	HE WILL COACH ITALY IN SMART WORKING

??	MANCINI POSITIVE TO COVID

??	The national team coach, Roberto Mancini was positive to the swab test that the entire staff always takes before the gatherings.

??	FROM TG SPORT

??	OF NOVEMBER , 

??	As of Sunday evening, the preparation retreat begins in Coverciano for the friendly match with Estonia and the games with Poland and Bosnia for which the Azzurri will play the first place in the group of Nations League.

??	But Chicco Evani will be on the bench.

??	It would have been better if Roberto had been here, and myself, his assistant.

??	I'll explain the training.

??	It won't be a tiring one.

??	Let's at least try to give it concentration.

??	It's a part of my character, that of always being low profile.

??	I don't like to be conspicuous,

??	I don't like to appear.

??	I would first like to celebrate a few "first times".

??	I would begin with Chicco Evani who...

??	I don't understand. Hello?

??	MANCINI DOES THE TRAINING

??	CONNECTED TO A LOUDSPEAKER

??	Yes, no. I was saying...

??	I was saying there are  minutes left.

??	Tell him to try to go out on the right with Calabria, and therefore, cover...

??	Ok.

??	And over here, El Shaarawy goes wide.

??	So we'll begin with Emerson,

??	Di Lorenzo, Solini and Grifo against Calabria, Bastoni, Pellegri...

??	Pellegri inside.

??	Where is Pelle? Are you there? Inside.

??	And Bernardeschi.

??	Where are you going?

??	We have to do the free kicks, too.

??	So...

??	Come on, boys! Six!

??	Ok, Pessina and Tonali dribblers.

??	No, it's mine! This one is mine!

??	It's ugly!

??	Mascagni in the place of...

??	El Shaarawy, come on.

??	Inside. The others inside!

??	Out all the others.

??	If the ball is on the ground you must turn quickly on the ground and then...

??	Only if you change the tactic, but when we're already on the centre circle.

??	There, they held their ground.

??	During training we saw a loudspeaker in the middle of the field, and Mancini talking.

??	And there was Evani. All of his people were trying to transmit to the players what Mancini had in mind.

??	I'm sorry Mancini isn't here.

??	He so much wanted to be.

??	But we are fortunate to have a computer and Skype for him to see.

??	That way the players will be happy.

??	When you'll do the tactic part today,

??	I've already talked to the staff.

??	It's important that when we begin the action we're all in our part of the field.

??	Because we need to dribble if they put pressure on us.

??	This may not be the game, but we are there ready, dribbling.

??	Then we'll stretch out and go...

??	When we reach the adversary's mid-field we'll get the positions with the five receiving lines.

??	My other collaborators and I often talk to him, especially Attilio Lombardo talks often.

??	Yes, we talk to Mancini.

??	Unfortunately, the swabs are still positive.

??	I was the first smart working coach in the history of football.

??	I hope to be there as soon as possible.

??	I just wanted to thank you.

??	I know you are all there.

??	I'd like to say hello to the newcomers and ...

??	And I hope to see you soon.

??	How are you, coach?

??	I'm fine now.

??	You look fine.

??	You can tell.

??	You can tell.

??	You can tell I just did one hour of cycling?

??	Yes, you can tell.

??	Are you still positive?

??	Is the level lower?

??	I don't know, I don't know.

??	I'll do another control now.

??	Do a good job and a hug to everyone.

??	I hope to see you soon.

??	Thanks, coach

??	Bye.

??	My hope was that of being negative...

??	I did a swab test every day hoping it would be negative, but unfortunately, I became negative on the day after the third game.

??	So that's how it went.

??	Ok.

??	On November th, the national team goes to Florence without its coach and with half the team missing because of Covid and injuries.

??	Debuting Evani lines up a team of new faces.

??	Two!

??	Despite the distance, they say he could have a direct line with Roberto Mancini.

??	Gianluca Vialli. Here it is, here it is.

??	Lombardo was in the grand stand.

??	He talked to Mancini in Rome.

??	Then Lombardo communicated to Vialli on the bench and Vialli gave instructions, advice, to Evani.

??	It is a great story of friendship.

??	Bernardeschi.

??	Bernardeschi's one on one.

??	Number ten moves, manages a strong left shot.

??	Federico Bernardeschi scores the  to  goal with a great personal action.

??	You are doing fairly well.

??	EVANI TALKS ABOUT THE TEAM
??	IN THE GAME'S INTERMISSION

??	I  say this because I have learned to know you. I know you are good.

??	So we must do the third and fourth.

??	Always with patience.

??	But patience doesn't mean being slow.

??	Patience means waiting, but I keep moving the ball.

??	Boom! And I hurt you.

??	Grifo scores,  to  for Italy, double goal by Vincenzo Grifo.

??	Orsolini, two out of two, an exceptional average.

??	Two games, two goals with the national team jersey.

??	It was wonderful. After the game when they were connected on the phone with Roberto,

??	Roberto thanked them all.

??	You played wonderfully.

??	Great coach!

??	Perfect.

??	Great.

??	Even if the adversary is a modest one, victory always has a sweet taste because it arrives in a complicated moment. And the young ones obtained it.

??	The most important thing I noticed in this staff and in this group is...

??	It's the trust they have in all the players.

??	Chicco! Chicco! Chicco! Chicco! Chicco!

??	The evening after the game, the newcomers must do the singing ritual.

??	Among them, this time there is also a hesitant Chicco Evani.

??	The least.

??	Something I must know now is how you people sing.

??	Together with the national team games the other great television ritual of the Italians is Sanremo.

??	For a few hours in Coverciano, football and singing meet up.

??	Amadeus came to film the ad for Sanremo .

??	Boys, this is it.

??	Insigne, let me see you.

??	A few moment of relaxation helps to avoid thinking that we are about to face two very important games without coach Mancini on the bench, and with fewer players.

??	It couldn't be worse. On the eve of the game against Poland

??	Leonardo Bonucci is injured.

??	He has to give up what would have been his th game on the national team.

??	We had an incredible series of players who couldn't play, among which many who have become positive, players who got injured...

??	Players who had never been summoned were called.

??	What can I say?

??	They did a very good job.

??	The less forces to deal with, the more important it is to measure them.

??	That is why there is a staff in Coverciano that keeps under control the physical fitness of the players and tries to prevent physical problems.

??	Well, the new technologies certainly help a lot for what concerns the technical-tactic part of the team, because today we have our analysts, and know everything about the work that we do when we train.

??	How much the boys put out athletically, besides the rest, what they do with cryotherapy that helps recuperate after  or  games in a row.

??	Surely much has changed since I used to play, and surely enormous steps have been taken, and it's a good thing.

??	The performance and research area of Club Italia has quite an extended staff of preparers, physiologists, nutritionists and bio-mechanics.

??	On the national team we have

??	Andrea Scanavino and Claudio Donatelli who are responsible for the athletic preparation of our football players, and have relations with the preparers of the club.

??	Elena Castellini, instead, follows the training load aspect, with a GPS, that has the data of the game and so on... While Matteo Pincella is the nutritionist, and tries to please and to follow the players in the nutritional field.

??	Attention, disinfection with ultraviolet rays.

??	Move immediately away from the robot.

??	Andrea, can you make protein pancakes for snack?

??	I saw on the menu that you plan on having quinoa, black rice.

??	Yes, you can do quinoa and black rice with season vegetables.

??	Perfect...

??	And...

??	Use some tomatoes, some eggplant...

??	Yes, asparagus, too. You can make a fruit salad to take to the locker room with some dried fruit and dark chocolate.

??	So, guys, let's take a look at the situation.

??	This morning we trained. Claudio, how did it go with the boys that played?

??	Over the years the role of the athletic preparer has greatly changed, in so much that he tries to support the athletes in evaluation and performance.

??	Andrea, how will we get organized?

??	Yes. Let's say that... to further favour the recuperation phase, each of them will do a cryosauna and the contrast activity in the pools.

??	They are boys who have different sorts of injuries.

??	In the past gatherings they began this procedure and greatly benefitted.

??	Therefore...

??	Since you've never tried this,

??	I'll do the basic program, so minus .

??	Ok.

??	Ok?

??	How long?

??	Three minutes.

??	You can move inside.

??	You can make small squats, movements with your arms.

??	Move your hands. If you get too cold, put your hands under your armpits.

??	Are you ready?

??	Go.

??	I'll have you go inside and let the music start.

??	Go.

??	It's cold!

??	Turn around.

??	Are you ready?

??	He is suffering.

??	I see him suffering inside a lot.

??	Yes, he's suffering in silence.

??	How did it go? Come. I must take your temperature. Come.

??	Was it cold?

??	Come on!

??	Getting injured is more frequent today because professional football is exasperated and exposes the players to increasingly intense performances.

??	The performance demands more speed, more intensity, more games.

??	And therefore, an injury

??	is always around the corner.

??	But actually they seem to be quite serene about this.

??	They love giving all they've got.

??	They live for that, so as soon as the referee whistles, they give all they've got.

??	I am not afraid of hurting myself.

??	Also because, it's something you know you must deal with.

??	It's normal. All football players during the year have a period when their body is less ready to face certain competitions.

??	It's physiological. We aren't machines, but are human beings.

??	The fear of getting hurt depends on many factors, especially the psychological and mental one.

??	If you think you can get hurt in every game, it will eventually happen.

??	You have to chase your fear away.

??	If you enter the field, it means you are well and must put that in your head.

??	I am entering the field because I feel well.

??	From there, all the fears in your head should go away.

??	Living with fear means beginning to defeat it.

??	Mancini's boys know that and they also know that they must win the next two games and defy any ill luck.

??	Winning would give us first place in the group of Nations League, and the mathematical certainty of being the highest ranking teams in the qualification draw for the World Cup.

??	Good evening.

??	The national team is having an emergency.

??	There's a long list of absent players, starting with the coach,

??	Roberto Mancini who hasn't yet defeated Covid.

??	In his place on the bench there will be his vice, Evani, as against Estonia.

??	The team is faced with an excellent level adversary.

??	In Reggio Emilia, for the fifth day of

??	Nations League we play Italy Poland.

??	Bernardeschi's cross, Belotti's header that gains a penalty kick.

??	It's a penalty kick. Nice and clean.

??	Jorginho.

??	Jorginho scores!  to  for Italy.

??	Barella leaps into the space.

??	Berardi is alone.

??	Berardi is alone. He controls with the left foot, converges.

??	Berardi in his stadium! Domenico Berardi!  to  for Italy.

??	We must count the passes for Italy.

??	Very many.

??	We are on the same level as Barcelona.

??	The real Barcelona, the Guardiola one.

??	It's a national team that does not aim at historical characteristics of our football, but wants to impose its game, and is doing so with excellent results.

??	It never wastes a ball, decides to always play in the adversary mid-field with very strong pressing.

??	In fact, the numbers confirm this.

??	He scores many goals.

??	"The first take is good" as they say in movies.

??	The last victory is missing to ensure st place in the group of the Nations League.

??	The Azzurri to go Sarajevo, city with a tragic past, to play against Edin Dzeko's Bosnia.

??	They play in a stadium that has a tragic history.

??	During the Sarajevo siege, the Serb militia set it on fire and filled it with mines.

??	At the end of the war the Italian army removed the mines hidden in every corner.
??	Barella and Berardi run fast.

??	An opening for Belotti...

??	Belotti! Italy is leading. Insigne's inspiration.

??	Andrea Belotti's goal.  to  for the Azzurri.

??	Emerson starts again with Locatelli, soft for Belotti!

??	Berardi, Berardi.

??	My gosh! It's a super goal by Berardi.

??	The difficulties bring the group closer and...

??	But I really think that in those ten days the boys showed their value as men, because it wasn't so simple or taken for granted to win the  games.

??	Actually, we did some accounting.

??	I think that we didn't call  or  players that usually come with us.

??	That is, we didn't have  or  of the usual players.

??	The rest were another , , or  that were players who had never come.

??	So they didn't just win the  games.

??	They won  games, by dominating and absolutely deserving it, and playing a spectacular football.

??	IN THE NEXT EPISODE

??	Even if they were at a distance, the  victories in November gave Mancini the renewed certainty of his team.

??	But now the European Championship is about to begin and our road in this tournament was often wonderful, but bitter.

??	The European Championship has always been jinxed for Italian football.

??	Riva, Riva, goal!

??	We won only once in  against Yugoslavia that had deserved it more than us.

??	Over the years we lost two finals.

??	One of which because of the darn golden goal.

??	One of the biggest disappointment that I've ever experienced.

??	It was at the European Championship in Holland, .

??	We had almost touched the cup with our hands.

??	Many of us remember the last time we lost during the penalty kicks.

??	Germany is in the semi-final of the European Championship.

??	If there's a national team that, even if it didn't win, had the Italian sports world fall in love, was that of  with Antonio Conte.

??	How did that European Championship end up?

??	There, too, with tears.

??	Gigi Buffon's tears of anger.

??	To get to the end of the European

??	Championship, up to the final in London,

??	Mancini's boys will have to be strong, stronger than their adversaries, but also stronger than the curse that seems to hover over this tournament.
