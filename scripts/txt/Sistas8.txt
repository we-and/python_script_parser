(“Old Faithful”)
(Episode 108)

KAREN	I know you ain't got no damn attitude with me.	
		
SABRINA	Previously on Sistas.	
ZAC	You see how she talks to me?  She makes me feel like I'm nothing.	
KAREN	Go.	
ZAC	She'd be talking about how you are the only one that didn't use your degree, she'd be talking about how you on a diet but you eat everything you see and she'd be talking about how you so ratchet that the other girls don't be wanna take you nowhere.	
DANNI	So they talk about me.	
SABRINA	Who?	
DANNI	Karen and Andi.	
SABRINA	No.	
ANDI	You should not have come here, Gary.	
GARY	Well, you should have returned my calls.	
ANDI	Gary, this is a bad idea.	
GARY	Will you come home?	
ANDI	I'll come home when I'm done.	
		
ANDI	(sighs) Hi, baby.  (sighs) Oh.	
GARY	Who was that?	
		
ANDI	Who?	
GARY	The man that dropped you off.	
ANDI	Okay.  Gary, you need to relax because…	
GARY	Is that him?	
ANDI	Is that who?	
GARY	I just feel like you're seeing someone else.	
ANDI	I can't do this with you tonight, okay?	
GARY	Yeah.  I--I know because, um, you haven't returned any of my calls all day.  I had to go into your office.  What's going on?	
ANDI	That woman that opened the front door for you, she fainted.  I called 911 and she begged me to ride with her to the hospital.  That was her grandson.  He just brought me back home, okay?  My car is still at the office.	
GARY	I'm sorry.  Are you okay?	
ANDI	Yes.	
GARY	How is she?	
ANDI	She'll be fine.	
GARY	It's just when I saw him hugging you, you know, I…	
ANDI	He was hugging me because he was thankful.	
GARY	I'm sorry.  I should have been more sensitive.	
ANDI	You shouldn't have been looking out the window at me.	
GARY	I know.  I'm sorry.  I've just been out of my head.  I never should have asked you to take my wife's case to help me.  What the hell was I thinking?	
ANDI	I'm representing her.	
GARY	(sighs) You are?	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
GARY	I don't think you should do that, especially not for me.	
ANDI	I'm not doing this for you.  I have no other option.  My boss would have it no other way.	
GARY	(sighs) I'm sorry you went all this.	
ANDI	Apparently, you are worth a lot of money and she wants half.	
GARY	I figured that.	
ANDI	Hmm.  So we have a serious issue.  Either I tell your wife…	
GARY	Ex-wife.	
ANDI	Current wife that I can't represent her and then my boss gets pissed and I get fired or she finds out that I rep you through her private detective, and I lose my job, and my life is done.  So pardon me if I didn't get a chance to talk to you.  I had to clear my head.	
SINGER	All my girls hold me down, let them boys mess around, and my love life is a headache, we're going out tonight, because I'm greater than love.	
		
ANDI	I had to clear my head.	
GARY	I understand.	
ANDI	Do you, Gary?	
GARY	I promise I do.	
ANDI	Good.  I'm going out.	
GARY	(stammers) With him?	
ANDI	Gary, I just told you.	
GARY	Does he have your number?	
ANDI	No.	
GARY	Did you give him yours?	
ANDI	What are you doing?	
GARY	You're a lawyer.  I know I have to ask the right questions.	
ANDI	Well, these questions are pissing me off.	
GARY	But you didn't answer the questions.	
ANDI	(sighs) You got a lot of nerve.	
GARY	I just wanna know.  You've been acting a bit strange.	
ANDI	I have been acting strange for good reason, don't you think?	
GARY	I'll give you that.	
ANDI	I'm going out with my girlfriends.	
GARY	So what am I supposed to do around here?	
ANDI	Is everything about you, Gary?	
GARY	Wow.  Okay.  I'm gonna go for a drive.	
ANDI	Yeah.  Do that.	
SINGER	Been some time since I said to thee how I love you, how I'm grateful.	
ANDI	I'm sorry, baby.	
GARY	No.  I'm the one that's sorry and for all of the […] I brought into your life.  I promise I will make this all up to you.  I promise I will.  I want to make you so damn happy…	
ANDI	(chuckles)	
GARY	…once we get past all of the […] I love you like you deserve.	
SINGER	Light it up, up, up.  Yeah.	
BACKUP SINGER	Light it up, light it up, light it out in the…	
MAN	Hey there, your friend's over there dancing.  You want to?	
SABRINA	No.  My feet hurt.  Girl.	
DANNI	Don't be grabbing on me.	
SABRINA	Get over here and sit your ass down.  Bye, gentlemen, bye.  Thank you.  Girl things.	
DANNI	Sabrina.	
SABRINA	Sit down.	
DANNI	Oh, okay.  Bitch got problems today.	
SABRINA	Damn.  What is going on with you?	
DANNI	That for me?	
SABRINA	Here, I got you vodka.	
DANNI	(clears throat) I know you bitches been talking about me.	
SABRINA	What are you talking about?	
DANNI	Zac told me everything that ho' said.	
		
SABRINA	Zac?	
DANNI	Yeah.  He was smoking, so he was telling the truth.	
SABRINA	Danni, you're gonna let a man that's mad at Karen tell you what we've been saying?	
DANNI	I don't know, girl.  Everything he said sound really true.	
SABRINA	Stop, girl, just stop, you need to smoke.	
DANNI	He took my pen.	
SABRINA	And he still has it?	
DANNI	Yes.  He took it and he didn't come out the bathroom.	
SABRINA	Woo, he's gonna be toe up.	
DANNI	Yeah.  That's that special blend.	
SABRINA	You really need to stop listening to him because we're your girls.	
DANNI	Oh, I'm still gonna ask her.	
SABRINA	Girl, you're gonna ask her, that's fine but you better watch it tonight.	
DANNI	Girl, he's a lightweight, he'll be asleep before I get home.	
SABRINA	Or on a pole.	
DANNI	Now that I'd like to see.  She need to sit down somewhere.	
SABRINA	Look, let her get her dance on, okay?  And her drink on.  You needed--drink up, you're better drunk, you happy then.  And be careful about what you say tonight, okay?  This whole Zac thing, don't tell her that he's living with you.	
DANNI	I'm gonna tell her when she sit down.	
SABRINA	Not tonight.	
DANNI	Girl, the things he said sound really true.	
SABRINA	Can you please stop?	
DANNI	Yeah.  Who's this dude she's seeing?	
SABRINA	Hmm.  It's the first time I heard of it, she never mentioned it to me but I don't think it's nothing.	
DANNI	See?  That's what I'm talking about.  Her and Andi holding out on me.	
SABRINA	They're not holding out on you.	
DANNI	Girl, you know they had their own little clique within our group.  I don't like that […].	
SABRINA	They're not talking about you.  You're very paranoid.  And by the way, you made that little clique happen, remember?	
DANNI	How did I make it happen?	
SABRINA	Because you talk too much, Danni.	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	You do.	
DANNI	Okay.  I don't talk about the big things.  I talk about stuff that don't matter.	
SABRINA	Okay.	
DANNI	Girl hush.  I'm gonna talk to them about holding out on us.  Where's Andi?	
SABRINA	She had to help somebody at work.  They're sick or something, she'll be here in a minute.	
DANNI	Watch.  She won't even show up.	
SABRINA	Yes, she will.	
DANNI	No.  No.  No.  When I invite them, they never show up, just like that time at Maxie's.	
SABRINA	Girl, somebody gets killed there every weekend.	
DANNI	So?  That didn't stop us when we're at Spelman.	
SABRINA	That was when we were in college.  We were young and foolish then.  We know better now.	
DANNI	If you say so.  Why do you keep looking at your watch?	
SABRINA	You know I got to get home soon.	
DANNI	(clicks tongue) Yeah.  With a man.	
SABRINA	(clicks tongue) You know I like to be at home in the bed.	
DANNI	With a man.	
SABRINA	I just got to be up early for work in the morning.	
DANNI	No, ma'am.  Uh-uh.  Girl, stop lying.  That's what I'm talking about, holding out on me.	
SABRINA	Okay.  All right.  All right.  He is coming by.	
DANNI	Girl, you gonna play with them lace panties?	
SABRINA	Girl, every time I tell you something about a man, I end up regretting it.	
DANNI	Yeah.  When you like him.	
SABRINA	No.  I'm just getting to know him.	
DANNI	That's what we all say when we're planning our wedding.	
SABRINA	Whatever.	
KAREN	Hmm, okay.  I need another drink.	
SABRINA	You having fun?	
DANNI	Oh, you're gonna need a whole lot of drinks when I get finished telling you what I have to say to you.	
		
SABRINA	No, no, no, no.  No.	
KAREN	What is it?	
DANNI	No.  Uh-uh.  I'm pissed.	
SABRINA	Nothing, nothing, nothing.  How was the dancing?  Hmm, saw you getting your move on.	
KAREN	What you got to tell me, Danni?	
DANNI	Hmm, uh, you bitches been talking about me behind my back saying like, uh, I need to go on diet and I eat everything like everything, really?	
KAREN	Yeah.  I said that.  But we all said it to your face, so what is you talking about?	
DANNI	It's hard for me […].	
KAREN	It's hard for all of us.	
DANNI	Oh, and why am I the last to know that you're seeing some dude?	
KAREN	Oh, my God.  I'm not holding out on you, okay?  I just met him.	
DANNI	Then tell me.	
KAREN	Okay.  Um, I met him at the supermarket.  We've been talking for a few days.  He just filed for divorce.	
SABRINA	Well, that's--that's good, right?	
KAREN	Yeah.	
DANNI	He lying.	
KAREN	I would say the same thing, but I sent him to Andi my damn self.	
SABRINA	For real?	
KAREN	Yes.  So he's real.  Get this.	
SABRINA	Hmm.	
KAREN	He showed up at my house and pissed me off.	
SABRINA	What was he doing at your house?	
KAREN	Exactly.  He said he wanted to apologize.  So he pulled me real close to him and out of nowhere, he kissed me, right?	
SABRINA	Wow.	
KAREN	Yeah.  But Zac was standing right there.	
SABRINA	Wow.	
KAREN	Yes.	
SABRINA	It's really awkward.	
KAREN	Wait.  You […] ain't surprised.  Who told you?	
SABRINA	I just…	
KAREN	Who told you?  Wait.  Are you all talking to Zac?	
SABRINA	No.	
KAREN	Well then, it must be you.	
		
SABRINA	Ooh, girl.  Those shoes.  Those shoes look so good.  So good.	
KAREN	Danni.	
DANNI	He's living with me.	
SABRINA	No, no, no, no.  No.  No.  No.  It's not like that.  It's not like that.  Tell her.  Tell her the whole story, Danni.	
DANNI	I found out he wasn't with that girl.  He was living in a shelter.  So I told him he can come live with me and I need help paying the rent.  And then that's when he told me all the shit you were saying behind my back.  Oh.  Oh, she quiet now?  Hmm?  Say some of that […] you were saying behind my back.  That's good.  That's real good.	
SABRINA	Look, she's--she's only helping him out.  Nothing is going on between them.  He need a place to stay.	
KAREN	No, I just--I think it's funny how he can play half your rent, but he couldn't pay mine.  He's a hustler.  But it's okay.  You are too, so you know that.  That's why you ain't never got no money.	
DANNI	Hmm.  So we going low, bitch?	
KAREN	That's what you do.	
DANNI	I'm not accepting your shit.  That boy loved you, but you made him feel like he couldn't do nothing right.  You […] that up, and now, you mad at the world.	
KAREN	No.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  I'm gonna go.	
SABRINA	No, no.  It's okay.	
KAREN	No.	
SABRINA	I got--I got this round.	
KAREN	No.  I'm not gonna stay here and deal with this shit.	
DANNI	She mad as hell now.  Hmm.  The truth hurts.	
KAREN	You know what?  I know that if he's staying with you, it's only a matter of time before you're […] him.  He's gonna be getting your little check too soon.  Watch.  Watch.	
DANNI	Keep it up.  You're just confirming everything he said.	
SABRINA	I have a date with that red panty guy.  (chuckles) You guys should've seen my face when I saw them.  You know, I opened his pants and I dropped down and I was just like, "Woo.  Dick-toria's got a secret."  (chuckles) Right?  Right?  I wonder where Andi is.	
ANDI/GARY	(chuckling)	
GARY	That was great.	
ANDI	That was great.	
GARY	Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	(smooches)	
GARY	(chuckles) I love you so much.  Don't tell me you doubt it.	
ANDI	I don't doubt that you love me at all.	
GARY	You sure?	
ANDI	(chuckles) I know that you love me.	
GARY	And you love me?	
		
ANDI	You know that.  You really do.  I have to go though.  (groans)	
GARY	What?	
ANDI	I told the girls I'll meet with them so…	
GARY	What do I got to do to get you to stay?  Hmm?  (smooches)	
ANDI	I had told them I would.	
GARY	Hmm.	
ANDI	(chuckles) Come on.	
GARY	(sighs) Look, I need you so much right now.	
ANDI	Okay.	
GARY	This is really hard for me.  But, um…	
ANDI	What is hard for you?	
GARY	This is hard for a man like me to say.	
ANDI	Say it.	
GARY	I'm scared.  I'm scared as hell.  You know, and I--I just really need you to stay the night with me.  I know that's selfish.  I mean, shit, it is selfish.  I've been that way through our entire relationship.	
ANDI	It's okay.  It really is.  I get it.  I do.	
GARY	I just love you so much.	
ANDI	(chuckles)	
GARY	You being here, it's the only thing that gives me comfort.  I was going crazy all day.	
ANDI	Are you sure that private detective didn't follow you here or to my office?	
GARY	That's what you're thinking about?	
ANDI	I had to ask.  I don't know.	
GARY	I'm pouring my heart out to you and that's what you're thinking about?	
ANDI	This is just a lot for me, Gary.  I…	
GARY	Look, I know.  Baby, I know.  But don't worry.  I'm watching my back.	
ANDI	And he is too.	
GARY	Do we know who he is?	
ANDI	Yeah.  I--I have his number, but I haven't spoken to him yet.	
GARY	Why would you?	
ANDI	Gary, please don't ask me any questions.	
GARY	Okay.  Okay.  I won't ask you anything else about it.	
ANDI	Okay.	
GARY	But…	
ANDI	But?	
GARY	I just…just stay here with me.  Let me hold you for a little while, girl.	
ANDI	Oh.  Just a little while?	
GARY	Please. Please.	
ANDI	Maybe.  If you beg a little harder…I may call the girls and tell them I'm not coming.	
GARY	Text them.	
ANDI	That's rude.	
GARY	Oh, my God.	
ANDI	It is.  	
GARY	Just text them.	
ANDI	No.  I gotta go.	
GARY	Stay here.	
ANDI	I gotta go.	
GARY	Stay.	
SINGER	Say it again.  Say it again.  Say it again.  Can you la, la, tell me again?  Baby, I'm used to it.  Ain't no confusing that.  Say it again.  Say it again.  Say it again.  Can you la, la, tell me again?	
		
ANDI	Hey.	
KAREN	Where are you at, Andi?  I'm about to leave.	
ANDI	Um, yeah.  Gary and I are talking, so I'm not gonna make it tonight.	
KAREN	Oh, okay.  I'm going home then.	
SABRINA	Where is she?	
KAREN	Something came up.  She ain't gonna make it.	
DANNI	See what I'm telling you?	
SABRINA	Stop.	
ANDI	Wait.  What did Danni mean by that?	
KAREN	I don't care.  It don't matter.	
DANNI	Are you still talking about me?	
KAREN	No.  I'm going home.	
ANDI	What is going on, Karen?	
KAREN	I'll tell you better in the car, okay?	
DANNI	Yeah.  You do that.  You tell her.	
KAREN	I'll talk to you later.	
ANDI	I don't like this.	
KAREN	Bye.	
SABRINA	No, no.  Come on.  I got it.  I'll pay it.	
KAREN	Oh, no, no.  I don't want you holding nothing over my head.	
DANNI	Like you did Zac?	
SABRINA	Can you all stop?  Seriously?  And that's not fair, Karen. Well, that went well.	
DANNI	…her.	
SABRINA	Girl, you need to stop.  You know you love her.	
DANNI	I should've […] him when I had the chance.	
SABRINA	Will you stop it?  You know that's your girl.  You love her.	
DANNI	I'm going home.	
SABRINA	Your phone is ringing.	
DANNI	I don't care.	
SABRINA	It's probably Andi.	
DANNI	Oh, I'm really not answering it.	
SABRINA	Danni. Girl, where are you?	
ANDI	Hey.  Girl, what's happening?	
SABRINA	Girl, they are mad.	
ANDI	About what?	
SABRINA	Well, how much time you got?	
ANDI	Girl, give me the T.	
SABRINA	Well…	
ANDI	Oh, oh, okay.  This is Karen.  I'll call you back, okay?	
SABRINA	All right.  Call me back.	
ANDI	Bye.  Karen, tell me what's going on.	
KAREN	Danni's being a real […].	
ANDI	Oh, God.  What is it?	
KAREN	She let Zac move in with her.	
ANDI	What?	
KAREN	She said that he was staying at a shelter.	
ANDI	A shelter?	
KAREN	Yes.  Okay?  She said that he was there and so she let him move in so he could help her with the rent.  Can you believe that?	
ANDI	Well…	
KAREN	Well, what?	
ANDI	Hold on.  Wait.  I'm not the enemy and you know that Danni's been struggling.	
KAREN	I know that.	
ANDI	And you kicked Zac out.	
KAREN	So this is my fault?	
ANDI	Hold on.  I didn't say that.	
KAREN	Yeah.  Well, you kind of did.	
ANDI	Listen, listen to me, honey, okay?  Just sometimes you're a little harsh.	
KAREN	Like when?	
ANDI	Um, Karen…	
KAREN	No.  Tell me when I was harsh, Andi.	
ANDI	Karen, let's not do this tonight, okay?	
KAREN	So because I don't take his shit, I'm the bitch?	
ANDI	I can't talk to you when you're this upset.  So can you calm down?	
KAREN	Okay.  Well then, I'll listen.  I'll listen, talk.	
ANDI	Okay.  Um, let's talk about it in the morning. Karen?	
KAREN	I forgot Gary's there.	
ANDI	Oh, do I need to come over there?	
KAREN	No, just go take care of that, please.	
ANDI	Okay.  I'll call you in the morning.  Love you. I'll be right back, okay?	
GARY	Where are you going?	
ANDI	Karen's going through some things.  So…	
GARY	Hey.  	
ANDI	It's just a lot right now, okay?  I'll be back Oh.	
GARY	Okay.	
ANDI	Can I use your car?	
GARY	Yeah.  The keys are in my pocket.	
ANDI	Oh, you know what, um, wait.  That's a bad idea.	
GARY	What?	
ANDI	If the private detective is following you, that's a bad idea.  I should take an Uber.	
GARY	No, no, no, no, just take the car, babe.  It's late, you know, nobody's watching you this late.	
ANDI	But what if he is?	
GARY	(chuckles) Where is she getting the money to pay him and I not know it?	
ANDI	I don't know.  She doesn't have her own money?	
GARY	Wait.  Has she moved some money?	
ANDI	Oh, I don't know.	
GARY	Are you telling me she's moving my money?	
ANDI	I'm not telling you anything.	
GARY	Good, because if she is, that would affect us.	
ANDI	You know what?  I don't like this at all.  So I'm gonna go.	
GARY	Okay.  Babe…	
ANDI	No, you just apologized for bringing me into this.  So no.	
GARY	I'm sorry.  Andi, I'm sorry. Oh, my God.	
DANNI	Hell.  Oh, God.  You know this ain't right.	
SINGER	Sometimes you make me hate you but you know you're still my favorite.  I give you love and then you take, and you get (indistinct) and when you leave, it makes me anxious.  You know I love but you make me feel some type of way.  Make me feel some type of way.  Ooh.  Make me feel some type of way.	
DANNI	Why are you calling me?	
SABRINA	Are you okay?	
DANNI	I'm fine.	
SABRINA	You sure?	
DANNI	Don't you have a hot panty date?	
SABRINA	That's very funny.  I'm on my way home.	
DANNI	Well, I'm fine.  Go have a good time, enjoy yourself.	
SABRINA	Where's Zac?	
DANNI	In my bed.	
SABRINA	Danni.	
DANNI	I walked in and I saw him passed out naked.	
SABRINA	What?  Why is he in your bed, Danni?	
DANNI	Girl, he is high.	
SABRINA	Girl, please, please, please, please do not sleep with that boy.	
DANNI	Good night.	
SABRINA	Danni, are you listening?  I'm serious.	
DANNI	I'm not.	
SABRINA	(groans) Oh, my God.  Danni, please.  You better listen to me.  Don't do that, you hear me?	
DANNI	All right.  Bye.	
SABRINA	No, uh, uh, uh, no, no, no, Danni, are you--I'm gonna call you tomorrow.	
DANNI	Go in there and play with panty boy.	
SABRINA	That's not funny.  I'm gonna talk to you tomorrow.	
DANNI	Bye.	
SABRINA	And we're gonna call Karen too.	
DANNI	Girl, don't make me hang up on you.	
SABRINA	Too soon?	
DANNI	Yes.	
SABRINA	All right.  I'm sorry.	
DANNI	Bye.	
SABRINA	Bye.  Tomorrow.  You look cute and comfortable.	
CALVIN	(chuckles) Thank you.  Honestly, I was getting ready to leave.  Thought you were standing me up.	
SABRINA	I'm sorry.	
CALVIN	So are you gonna invite me in?	
SABRINA	Oh, yeah.	
CALVIN	Yeah?	
SABRINA	Yeah, sorry.  Yes.  Come in.  Come in.  (chuckles) Do you want something to drink?	
		
SINGER	Yeah.  Oh, huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. Yeah.  Uh, yeah, you talking to, you talking to who?  Don't (indistinct) what you wanna do?  Pay attention, you might learn a thing or two.  I don't think I had no need for the (indistinct)	
CALVIN	What?  What's wrong?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.	
SABRINA	Can we just do what we did the other day?	
CALVIN	(pants) Same thing happened last time. What's up?	
SABRINA	It's nothing.  It's nothing.	
CALVIN	No, come on now.  Come on.	
SABRINA	Huh?	
CALVIN	Remember, use your words.	
SABRINA	Don't talk to me like a kid, Calvin.	
CALVIN	I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  Come on.  Tell me what's up.	
SABRINA	It's just those.	
CALVIN	What?  They're just underwear.	
SABRINA	But they're so feminine.	
CALVIN	You think?	
SABRINA	Kind of.	
CALVIN	Hmm, never really thought about it.	
SABRINA	Really?	
CALVIN	Yeah.  Look, my parents just raised me to be very open-minded.	
SABRINA	Uh-huh.  Okay.	
CALVIN	You have a problem with this?	
SABRINA	I'm just getting to know you.	
CALVIN	I see.	
SABRINA	You see what?	
CALVIN	(scoffs) I see you're gonna keep judging me all the time.	
SABRINA	I just…	
CALVIN	Sabrina.	
SABRINA	I don't like them.  I don't like them.  I don't like them.  I like my man in boxers and with dirty fingernails, and--and even your feet look better than mine.  Is--is that clear toenail polish?	
CALVIN	Okay.  First of all, they are buffed.	
SABRINA	Okay.	
CALVIN	No.  But I get it.  (clicks tongue) You don't want me.	
SABRINA	Um--oh, come on, I didn't say that, Calvin.	
CALVIN	No, no.  You want me, but you want me to be who you want me to be.	
SABRINA	This--this--this is new for me.  I just need a minute to adjust, you know?  I'm just trying to see how and what you think.	
CALVIN	(scoffs) What is there to understand?  I'm just me.  I can't be nobody else but me.	
SABRINA	So what are you saying?	
CALVIN	I'm saying maybe we just hold back on the intimacy part, you know?  Just get to know each other.	
SABRINA	Okay.	
CALVIN	Sabrina, I'm not saying I wanna stop this, all right?  That's not what I'm saying.  But until you see me the way I see you, I mean, hell, I don't talk about the things that bother me about you.	
SABRINA	Wait.  Something bothers you about me?	
CALVIN	Oh, hell.  Nope.  Nope, nope, nope.  It's hard to get to you.  We ain't doing this.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  Will you just tell me what bothers you about me?	
CALVIN	(sighs) (clicks tongue) I think I'm gonna say goodnight.	
SABRINA	Are you--are you sure?  You don't have to leave.	
CALVIN	Yeah.  I'ma go.	
SABRINA	Uh, did I hurt your feelings?	
CALVIN	No.  Not at all.  I just know I'm not what you're looking for.	
SABRINA	I never said that.	
CALVIN	Look, just think about it, all right?	
SABRINA	Are you really leaving?  It's late.	
CALVIN	Yeah.	
SABRINA	Are you sure?  I'm really sorry.	
CALVIN	There's nothing to be sorry for.  I'm just me.  Hey, look.  I'll call you tomorrow, all right?	
SABRINA	Okay.	
CALVIN	Goodnight.  (smooches)	
SABRINA	Damn!	
KAREN	Hey.	
RICO	Damn.  You look good.	
KAREN	Oh, thank you.  Come in.	
RICO	Brought the wine.	
KAREN	Okay.  Open it.	
RICO	Of course.	
KAREN	Oh, that's a good bottle.	
RICO	Thanks.  You know, I'm surprised you called me.	
KAREN	Why?	
RICO	Because you haven't returned my text.	
KAREN	Oh.  You know I got a situation, Rico.	
RICO	Yeah.	
KAREN	(clears throat)	
RICO	I understand that.	
KAREN	Hmm.  And he's here all the time.	
RICO	I know.  But that don't mean I don't stop thinking about you.	
KAREN	Oh, I think about you too, Rico.	
RICO	No, you don't.	
KAREN	Yes, I do.	
RICO	Yeah?  You laying up with old boy thinking about me?	
KAREN	Look, listen.  He can't do what you do, okay, Rico?  Come on.  Come on.  You know what it is.  (clears throat)	
RICO	(sighs) Look, why don't you ever date me?	
KAREN	Oh, Rico, come on.  You know we're really good friends.  We're really good friends.  Come here, Rico.  Come on.	
RICO	Look…	
KAREN	Come on.	
RICO	Wait, wait, wait.  I wanna talk.	
KAREN	No.  Rico, we talk too much.	
RICO	No, no, no.  We never get to talk.	
KAREN	I know, Rico, on purpose.  Come on, Rico, come on.  Sit down, sit down, come here, please.	
RICO	Wait.  Well, you know how I feel about you.	
KAREN	Yeah.	
RICO	What?  I'm just some dude you call when you ain't getting what you need from old boy?	
KAREN	(sighs) Look, Rico, can we--can we not?	
RICO	No.  I love you and you know this.	
KAREN	Rico…	
RICO	No, no, no, no.  As much as I wanna give you all this, I know you're playing me.  So now this, we're not doing this.  I got something better now and I came here to tell you that face to face.  I'm getting married, so I need you to lose my number and you're gonna miss this tongue and this […].	
KAREN	You just came here to humiliate me, then?	
RICO	No.  I came here to free me.  Have a good life, Karen.  Enjoy the wine.	
KAREN	What the hell is going on with me right now?	
ANDI	You tell me.  Girl, you know I had to come check on you.	
KAREN	I told you I'm fine, okay?  I'm fine.	
ANDI	Uh-huh.  Well, who the hell was that?  Wait.  Was that Rico?	
KAREN	Andi.	
ANDI	You're still messing with him.  (laughs)	
KAREN	You know he's old faithful.	
ANDI	Wow.  (laughs)	
KAREN	I know you're not laughing like you ain't got TJ on speed dial.	
ANDI	Which I never use.	
KAREN	Since meeting Gary.	
ANDI	Okay.  Touche.	
KAREN	Anyways, that's over.  Rico told me he's getting married.	
ANDI	Wait, what?  (laughs)	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.  Girl, he told me off, all the way off.	
ANDI	What did he--what did he say?	
KAREN	(sighs) Basically that he's not a piece of meat.	
ANDI	Oh.	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	Go, Rico.	
KAREN	I know, right?	
ANDI	(chuckles)	
KAREN	But his ass is a slab of pork.  (clears throat)	
ANDI	That you love.	
KAREN	Oh, he knows what to do.	
ANDI	Then you complain about how much he sweats, so…	
KAREN	Yeah, but he brought wine.  I was just gonna deal with it tonight.	
ANDI	Zac and Aaron got under your skin like that, huh?	
KAREN	And my mama.	
ANDI	And your mama?	
KAREN	Yeah.  She came by earlier.	
ANDI	Oh.  You know, I need to call your mom.	
KAREN	You know she's not gonna tell you what you wanna hear.	
ANDI	But she tells me what I need to hear and that's why we all love her.	
KAREN	Okay.  Well, you need to call your mama.	
ANDI	So she can die when she finds out about Gary?  No, thank you.	
KAREN	What's going on with that?	
ANDI	I met somebody tonight.	
		
KAREN	What?  Girl.	
ANDI	(chuckles) I mean, no, not like that.  But, um, the woman who went to the hospital at my job…	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	…her grandson.  His name is Paris and he brought me home.  And girl, I don't know.  I just felt like I knew him.  Oh, and get this.  	
KAREN	What?	
ANDI	So I go upstairs and Gary is standing at the window, watching us talk.	
KAREN	Girl, shut the […] up.	
ANDI	He was!  (laughs)	
KAREN	Like a […] stalker?	
ANDI	Like a stalker.	
KAREN	Oh, my God.  That's not cute.	
ANDI	No.	
KAREN	Uh-uh.	
ANDI	It was kind of cute.	
KAREN	Andi, um, Gary left his wife.	
ANDI	I know.	
KAREN	So you just better be sure that's what you want.	
ANDI	I mean, that's a lot, Karen.	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	Okay.  And get this, when I was leaving, he starts grilling me about her moving his money.	
KAREN	Oh, no.  I don't like that.	
ANDI	And I don't either.	
KAREN	Uh-uh.	
ANDI	And I told him that.	
KAREN	So what does that mean?	
ANDI	(sighs) I think I'm gonna tell him to leave.	
KAREN	Really?	
ANDI	Yeah.	
KAREN	All I'ma tell you is, you better be sure that you want that man because he left his wife.	
ANDI	And all I'ma tell you is, those little pink condoms say your love about Rico.	
KAREN	I'm not marrying him.	
SINGER	Just call my name.  If you want it in the evening…	
BACKUP SINGER	Baby.	
SINGER	…just do the same.  Let me suck it to you, suck it to you, suck it to you, suck it to you the way a woman can.  Let me give it to you, baby.  Make you feel like a real, give me, give me, give me.	
BACKUP SINGER	Give it to me, give it to me.  Give it…	
SINGER	Give me.	
DANNI	Wash your hands.	
ZAC	(sighs)	
DANNI	(groans) Nasty ass.  I was wondering when you're gonna get up.	
ZAC	Hmm.	
DANNI	What are you doing?  What are you--Zac!  What are you doing?  Zac, what are you doing?	
ZAC	Shut up and kiss me.	
DANNI	Zac.	
ZAC	You still talking?	
DANNI	Zac.	
ZAC	Uh-hmm.	
DANNI	Next on Sistas.	
ZAC	Did we?	
DANNI	You?  You're pretty good.	
ZAC	(groans) The hell would you let this happen?	
ANDI	I've been thinking and I think you should go make nice with her.	
GARY	Are you serious right now?	
ANDI	I don't see any other way.	
SABRINA	Are we being a little bit close-minded, considering the way that he was raised?	
WOMAN	I don't know, but I think he's low, like, down low sweet and low.	
CALVIN	Let's go.  Down.  Up.  Come on.	
SABRINA	I can't breathe now, girl.	
KAREN	Look, look, look, look, look.	
SABRINA	What the hell?  Oh, I'm out of here.	
WOMAN	No, no, no, no.  Girl!	
ANDI	No, no, no, no.
