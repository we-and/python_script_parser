DAD	Wow...

ABBY/LAURE	Ew, look.

DAD	It's a trout. That one's for you, Abby. 

LAURE	What about me? 

DAD	Next one.

MOM	Hi!

BOY	No!

GINGER MAN	Where you goin’!

Fuck!

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	Damn kid!

GINGER MAN	Damn!

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	Is he out? Is the kid out?

GINGER MAN	What did you do?

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	Go, go. I'll open the trunk. Tie him up. Not a fuckin’ bowtie, tie him tight! He can’t feel it anyway.

GINGER MAN	Grab him.

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	Got him... Got him. 

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	Come on! Take your sweet time there!

GINGER MAN	Will you be quiet!

MOM	Okay, let’s take a picture! Just go stand with Abby. Go, go, go. You go down and stand together really close. 

MOM	Keep smiling. Look at me the whole time, okay? Keep smiling, okay?

MOM	Abby? Abby! Honey, look at the camera!

MOM	Big smile okay. Great big smile.

MOM	So, you’re gonna say "cheese."

MOM/DAD	Cheese!

TWENTY-SOMETHING GIRL	What’s that?

TWENTY-SOMETHING BOY	My “Iron Ring”.

TWENTY-SOMETHING GIRL	Wow.

TWENTY-SOMETHING BOY	They give it to the engineers when we graduate. The iron’s from the first Quebec Bridge that collapsed and killed thirteen people.

TWENTY-SOMETHING GIRL	That’s kind of morbid.

TWENTY-SOMETHING BOY	It’s symbolic. I think they use stainless steel now. Iron turns your fingers black

BUS DRIVER	Good afternoon, folks. We’re about ten minutes from our destination and about ten seconds from your first glimpse of the Falls.
RANDY	May I first give you my deepest condolences. Your mother was a force, but you guys would know that better than anybody..Now, where’s my glasses...

LAURE	So, I just sign this, and it’s done?

RANDY	No. I need you both to sign it.

ABBY	She agreed to this?

RANDY	Well, the building’s worthless. It’s less than worthless, when you count the cost of tearing it down. But that is a fair price for the land.

ABBY	The Charles Lake Company?

RANDY	It wasn’t exactly a bidding war.

ABBY	The Rainbow was everything to her.

RANDY	She wasn’t given much of a choice… was she?

LAURE	This looks good to me.

ABBY	Laure...

ABBY	Laure... Come on, this is our legacy.

LAURE	Abby, are you serious?

ABBY	The agreement says we have six weeks. C’mon, we have to try.

LAURE	Try? Try what? The… The Rainbow?

ABBY	It’s what Mom would want. 

LAURE	Mom arranged the sale you just walked out on. The place is a dump, Abby. Hookers wouldn’t even use it.

ABBY	They’re gonna turn it into a fucking glow-in the-dark mini-golf, or something.

LAURE	Good!

ABBY	We grew up there!

LAURE	Yeah, one of us grew up.

SINGH	Jesus! This thing is not…

SINGH	Hey, man, I think the jukebox is broken. 

BARTENDER	Sorry. 

SINGH	But the sign said that

ABBY	Sign says it’s free.

ABBY	Doesn’t say it works.

SINGH	Well, shit. 

ABBY	Just so you know, the haunted houses aren’t actually haunted. And the fun houses aren’t actually fun.

SINGH	Nice one. I like that.

ABBY	Just saving you money, dude. 

ABBY	Passing through?

SINGH	Here for a job. So, I guess you’re a local?

ABBY	I grew up here.

SINGH	That means you’re a local.

ABBY	I grew up here. 

SINGH	You grew up here. Well, okay, Miss I-Grew-Up-Here I thought that this whole place was supposed to be like Vegas and it’s not.

ABBY	Well, it’s the low season. They even turn down the Falls.

SINGH	How do you turn Niagara Falls down? 

ABBY	It’s a series of locks, divert the water to the power plant. I’m doing my Master’s on the hydro dam. Trying to get that iron ring. It’s an engineering thing. The metal's from a… a bridge that killed a bunch of people. 

ABBY	It’s morbid, but... symbolic.

SINGH	Is that true, seriously?

ABBY	Look it up. You know what I’d do? I’d dry the whole thing up. Like the Americans did back in the day. This is a nice town. But the thing drives people crazy. It’s just a bunch of water falling over some rocks. 

SINGH	Do you want another one? 

ABBY	Sure.

SINGH	Wow. Whoa.

ABBY	Well, it’s… not exactly how it looks on the website. Wait.

SINGH	I like that. 

ABBY	Yeah. 

SINGH	I like that. Okay. 

ABBY	I’m a virgin. 

SINGH	What did you say? 

ABBY	Nothing.

SINGH	Wait, wait. Did you… just say you’re a virgin?

ABBY	No. 

SINGH	You’re not a virgin. There's... You just… 

SINGH	You just picked up a stranger in a bar! So, what’s up with that? Hello? Fuck. Weird as fuck!

ABBY	Sorry. No vacancy. 

CHARLIE	Are you Abby? Abby. Charlie. From the CLC. No. Look, I’m not here to start any trouble. We’re a family business, too. I understand what you’re going through. We...lost my father a few years back. It was…   Condolences.

CHARLIE	I was actually surprised to hear from your mother when we did. Takes a certain kind of moxie to run a place like this.

ABBY	What does it take to pilfer it from a vulnerable widow?

CHARLIE	I just want you to know if you do change your mind… No hard feelings. Really. Pleasure to meet you, Abby.

ABBY	Thanks.

LAURE	For what?

ABBY	Dinner.

LAURE	It was his idea. 

ABBY	So, Marcus, what do you do at the casino? 

MARCUS	Well, nothing fancy like your sister.

LAURE	He’s our first line of defense. 

LAURE	Tell her what you look for. It’s very scientific. 

MARCUS	Okay. Well, there is a certain art to it. Rapid blinking, placing objects between themselves and the dealer. Feet pointed towards an exit. Well, verbally, it’s stuff, like formalized language…I mean, like, “I did not have sexual relations…”

WALTER	Hi. Fishing lures. Just fishing lures today. But I have found other things, I can tell you. 

ABBY	Like what?

WALTER	Firearms, watches, wedding rings. That one’s usually a grand gesture! Everything that goes over the Falls ends up flowing through this big basin here. Sometimes I get lucky. Walter. Nice to meet you.
ABBY	Nice to meet you. 

WALTER	Yeah. Out of town? 

ABBY	Vancouver. 

WALTER	That’s far away. Well, you’ve come to the right guy. Yeah. I’m sort of the town historian. You like podcasts? 

ABBY	Sure. 

WALTER	Yeah, it’s called “Over the Falls”. Lot of history around these parts. An awful lot of history.

ABBY	I bet. 

WALTER	Well… remember...rate and review. The podcast. It helps our rankings.

LAURE	Abby, but… how’d you get up here? 

ABBY	I’m resourceful.

LAURE	What are you doing here? 

ABBY	Visiting you at work, because you’re my sister. 

LAURE	You can’t be here.

ABBY	So this is the eye in the sky.

LAURE	I’m just a supervisor. Stop stalling.

ABBY	Remember back when we were kids? 

LAURE	I don’t quite know how to answer that. 

ABBY	Remember I used to talk about the one-eyed boy? 

LAURE	I remember you telling me about a lot of things.

ABBY	He had one eye. Okay... I found a picture. Before you say anything just hear me out

LAURE	I can’t do this right now, at my work.

ABBY	When then? 

MALE VOICE	Channel five. Come in, channel five.

LAURE	Yeah. Surveillance. Go ahead. 

MALE VOICE	consolidate?

LAURE	They’re on separate channels. They can’t be consolidated. 

LAURE	Yeah. 

LAURE	I have a break at five. If you want to visit your sister, like a regular person, you can do it then…in the lobby.

MARCUS	Hey, what are we doing here? 

ABBY	Thanks for the lift, by the way. Laure would kill me if I got you involved. 

MARCUS	Look, Abby...Laure has told me some things.

OFFICER	Abby West!

SINGH	So how can I help you, Miss West?

ABBY	I want to report a kidnapping.

SINGH	A kidnapping? 

ABBY	Yeah. A boy… near the Queenston docks. Thanksgiving weekend, 1994. 

SINGH	1994? 

ABBY	Yeah.

SINGH	You witnessed this?

ABBY	Yeah. 

SINGH	How old were you? 

ABBY	Seven.

SINGH	You were seven. 

ABBY	I found a picture. Pretty sure those are the people that took him. 

SINGH	How old was the boy? 

ABBY	Older than me. Maybe twelve, thirteen.

SINGH	Why didn’t your parents report it?

ABBY	They didn’t see it. I was the only one around.

SINGH	Why didn’t you tell them? 

ABBY	Well, I think I did. Well, I told my sister, but she called me a liar.

SINGH	Well. Yeah. Is that it?

ABBY	Yeah.
SINGH	Thank you for coming in.

MARCUS	That’s it?

SINGH	Yes.

MARCUS	I’m sorry, you have an eyewitness coming forward about a child abduction and you’re not even writing anything down. 

SINGH	Based on my experience, I don’t trust your friend.

MARCUS	She’s my sister-in-law. 

SINGH	You’re married? 

MARCUS	She’s my wife’s sister!

MARCUS	What is going on here?

ABBY	He’s new.

ABBY	First week on the job, right? Fitting in?

SINGH	So far. 

ABBY	Must be. Turning away a witness on a hunch?

SINGH	Okay. Well, wait here.

MARCUS	You know him? 

ABBY	No.

MARCUS	Hey. Hey! Abby!

ABBY	What? 

MARCUS	This isn’t one of your fantastical stories, is it? 

ABBY	Is that what Laure calls them?

ABBY	So?

SINGH	No.

ABBY	No!?

SINGH	There are no open or closed cases of a missing boy that match your date or description.

SINGH	So remember to sign yourselves out when you leave.

MARCUS	I just didn’t like the smugness, you know? The attitude. You absolutely did the right thing. I mean, you just never know. Heck, maybe you saw something in the papers and you just combined it in your head...

MALE NARRATOR	The best and the bravest have always been drawn to Niagara Falls. Lured perhaps by the chance to showcase their extraordinary skills on the world’s largest stage. Their names have become legend. But only one name electrifies the millions who flock to the Falls every year. Only one name rings out above the roar and thunder of the water…

CHARLES LAKE II	Well, for several years we’ve been looking for an entry point into the dinner theatre market. Now that search is over. 

MR. MOULIN	Our audiences will absolutely love

MRS. MOULIN	Yeah. We’re truly indebted to Mr. Lake.

MR. AND MRS. MOULIN	Yeah. He inspired us to create our greatest trick yet.

MRS. MOULIN	It’s because of him. 

MR. MOULIN	It’s because of him.

MRS. MOULIN	Yeah

MR. MOULIN	Absolutely.

MALE NARRATOR 	But their greatest trick wouldn’t be possible without the help of a very special assistant. 

MR. MOULIN	She is our…

MRS. MOULIN	Tigers are family to us. They’re like collaborators.

MR. MOULIN	Oui. She’s having a snack right now. It’s really a great evolution of our magic. 

MRS. MOULIN	Yeah.

CHARLIE	The leather jacket was a bad choice. You know, my grandad originally built this as a private residence. Priggish, right? But it was also used as a convalescent hospital by the air force after the war. 

ABBY	I remember the school field trip. 

CHARLIE	Well, that must have been after they got our historic status. But the future King Edward VIII sat in this very chair. 

ABBY	Cool. He was friends with Hitler, right? I’m here about the Rainbow. What were you gonna do with it? 

CHARLIE	I probably shouldn’t say. But glow-in-the-dark paintball maze. Killer, right? 

ABBY	Killer.

CHARLIE 	Look, I know the folks down at city hall. Maybe we could get a plaque put up. "The Former Site of the Historic Rainbow Inn." What do you think? 

ABBY	What about a job?

CHARLIE	A job? 

ABBY	You’re the biggest employer in town. If I lose my motel, I’m going to need something to do. 

CHARLIE	Okay. What did you have in mind? 

ABBY	Well, I could get used to working in a place like this. What does that mean?

CHARLIE	Well, it means that we can discuss it. 

ABBY	Great.

CHARLIE	But right now I have a date with my family. So…

ABBY	Is it in town?

CHARLIE	Why?

ABBY	Remember them? They used to have a show on the Hill when I was a kid.

CHARLIE	They used to be our crown jewel. 

ABBY	No!

CHARLIE	Oh, yeah. 

ABBY	Well, it seems like they crossed over to the dark side. 

CHARLIE	Yeah. It was a major, major…You’re probably too young. Their son… they found him in the gorge.

ABBY	No shit! 

CHARLIE	Yeah, suicide. The Bells found him. At least what was left of him. 

ABBY	Are they sure it was a suicide?

CHARLIE	You’ve got a curious streak?

ABBY	Journalism school.

CHARLIE	Yeah. Well, from what I remember, the kid was… troubled.

ABBY	You knew him?

CHARLIE	Yeah, I did. Even took him under my wing. So…

ABBY	So the Moulins just… packed up, took their show across the river?

CHARLIE	Yeah, something like that. 

ABBY	Hi. 

LAURE	Hi. You never came back. Have you been staying here?

ABBY	No.

LAURE	No?

LAURE	I remember the one-eyed boy.

ABBY	You do? 

LAURE	I remember you telling me about some kidnapping, yeah.

LAURE	I also remember the fossil bones, Enrique Iglesias, the prison letters. You see where I’m going?

ABBY	What? 

LAURE	Now you’re lying to the cops.

ABBY	I didn’t lie.

LAURE	And you dragged my husband into this? Are you crazy? 

ABBY	It was his idea.

LAURE	Yeah, I’m sure he thought it was.

ABBY	Laure! I’m not lying.

ABBY	Just give me two minutes. Two minutes. After that if you still think it’s bullshit… I’ll drop it.

ABBY	Okay... sit down. Laure... What do you know about The Magnificent Moulins?

LAURE	I don’t know. Tigers and smoke machines and corny magic tricks.

ABBY	Okay, this article, dated October 13th, 1994, states that Alex Moulin the duo’s only child, was declared dead by suicide. He allegedly jumped into the gorge. However, they never recovered his body. So, how’d they know it was suicide?

LAURE	Probably the police didn’t release everything to the press.

ABBY	Okay, fine. 
ABBY	Now remember this? That was the day before Thanksgiving, 1994. Four days before the article came out. It’s date-stamped, if you don’t believe me. You said yourself you remember me telling you about a kidnapping that day. 

ABBY	A boy, possibly like Alex. Besides that picture, Mum took dozens of photos that day. This... being one of them. Now watch this.  I found this at the library. It’s a film about the Moulins made two years before Alex’s death. There. Look at that woman with the black hair. Now, look at this picture. Laure...Tell me I’m lying.

LAURE	Shit.

LAURE	Okay, I found something. "Collectively known as 'The Diving Bells.' The Bells were a local family of daredevils and rescuers. Pulled over two hundred bodies from the gorge in the last half century..."

ABBY	"The best and the bravest..." 

LAURE	Looks like it was a multi-generational thing. One died in 1977. Thomas Bell, a stunt gone wrong. He left four children, most of them still in the family business  Catherine, Walter, Scott and Tony. There’s a playground named after them uptown

ABBY	Wait! Go back. The kids, what were their names? 

LAURE	Catherine, Walter, Scott and Tony.

WALTER	Ndio, kwe and yiheh, to the "Over The Falls" podcast

WALTER	recorded live from the hangar deck of Niagara Falls’ only flying saucer…I’m Walter Bell and, folks as Lawrence Welk would say: “It’s wonderful, wonderful to be here.” We’ve got a triple-A gem of a show for you today…

AUTOMATED VOICE	Alien lifeform approaching. 

WAITRESS	Greetings earthlings. For two? 

ABBY	Yeah. 

WAITRESS	Follow me. Back in a chronon.

LAURE	So what now?

ABBY	Maybe he’s in the back.

LAURE	Abby!

ABBY	What?

WAITRESS	Ladies’ room is downstairs, honey, on the left.

ABBY	Thanks. 

WAITRESS	Something for you, hon?

WALTER	…all to maybe find a halfway peaceful spot below the Falls where you can spawn and die. It’s a hard thing for any of us to imagine but it’s what makes the salmon in this region so hard to catch and such a fine, rare treat to eat!

WALTER	El Viejo Seafood on Lundy’s Lane has a half-price special on king and coho salmon every Tuesday. And, if you ask me, that’s a deal worth swimming upstream for. I’m Walter Bell. This is “Over the Falls” and ‘til next time… eskonyen.

WALTER	Hey! Vancouver.

ABBY	Alex Moulin.

WALTER	Close the door.

WALTER	What are you? 

ABBY	I’m just someone who saw it. 

WALTER	What do you mean, saw it? Saw what? 

ABBY	Saw them take him.

WALTER	You would’ve been 

ABBY	I was seven! I was there when it happened. And I have proof. 

WALTER	Vancouver…

ABBY	No, I’m… I’m a local.

ABBY	The Rainbow Inn.

WALTER	Go back and order something...eat, then walk two blocks east and look for a blue Toyota. And come alone.	

LAURE	Abby, we need to talk about some things.

ABBY	Like what? You don’t trust me. 

LAURE	I... trust you not to set my house on fire. I don’t always feel like you’re telling me the truth. 

ABBY	All right, Laure, what can I do? You tell me?

LAURE	All right. What happened in Toronto? Mum wouldn’t tell me. 

ABBY	Nothing happened. 

LAURE	Abby, the truth…please. 

ABBY	I was freelancing. Doing pretty well actually, and I met a guy. A really nice guy. 

LAURE	What was his name?

ABBY	Daniel. Things got pretty serious, fast. And... I started telling lies and then more lies...It all just got away from me… as it always does. Everything turned to shit. So...I checked myself into a place for a couple of weeks and...then Mum had her heart attack.

ABBY	That’s it.

LAURE	Thank you. I know that wasn’t easy. 

ABBY	Yeah. 

LAURE	I really gotta go.

LAURE	I’ll see you?

ABBY	I saw those two people force Alex into the trunk of their car.

ABBY	Right where we first met. Do you know them?

WALTER	No.

WALTER	Open this. A bloody cap. One shoe. That’s what I found. All I found. Does that say suicide to you? 

ABBY	How did you get this? 

WALTER	Not every bluecoat was in Charles II's pocket.

ABBY	Charles Lake II?

WALTER	Didn’t you listen to the podcast?

ABBY	I mean… I’m sorry…Alex was just a kid. What did he have to do with Charles Lake II? 

WALTER	Nothing. The same can’t be said for Charles III. 

ABBY	Charlie? 

WALTER	He took a special interest in Alex. You catch my drift? No, don’t let that bon enfant routine fool you. Forgiving Charlie his trespasses was a regular cottage industry at CLC.

ABBY	How do you know this? 

WALTER	Look up Donnie Mason. Two years before Alex. Like I said... it’s not the first time. Probably won’t be the last. 

ABBY	And the Moulins? They must’ve known something was going on. 

WALTER	Those two cockatiels? I don’t think so.

WALTER	Ask yourself: cui prodest? Who profits? After losing Alex, the Moulins stopped performing. They got their pink slip. Meanwhile, CLC and their pervert prince continued to rule the roost. I’ve always had the motive. Now... here’s the means and the opportunity. Track ‘em down. You might be able to complete the picture. You keep it. Maybe you’ll have better luck than I did.

WALTER	Do you know what happens  when a body hits the water at the bottom of the gorge? Think swallowing a live grenade. It’s no longer a body you’re looking for, but pieces of a body. So, what makes the Alex Moulin case so special? Well, here was a boy, just like Donnie Mason before him who we're told leaped into the mighty gorge and vanished forever. Friends, I’ve fished corpses out of the Niagara for thirty years.

WALTER	So I can tell you, there’s always a piece of something.

WALTER	Take it from me... this was no suicide.

WALTER	The savagery of the first Charles Lake is well documented. And his son, Charles II, well, he learned from the best.

WALTER	But Charles III had his eyes on something else entirely. Something depraved, even by his family’s standards. As soon as he set his sights on Alex, that boy was as good as gone.
ABBY	I’m here to sell.

CHARLIE	You’re not going to ask for shares or something now, are you? 

ABBY	I’m not here to negotiate.

CHARLIE	You know, this usually goes through the lawyers.

ABBY	Well, I’m guessing they wrote it. So, I don’t see why we need them. Signed on every page.

CHARLIE	Well, this is excellent. Excellent. 

ABBY	This is impressive. 

CHARLIE	Yeah. A lot of great memories up there. 

ABBY	B.M…

CHARLIE 	My favourite... right here. Rush! They performed for my eighteenth birthday. 

ABBY	What about this one? This must have been before Alex disappeared.

CHARLIE	That’s what this is? 

ABBY	I have a curious streak.

CHARLIE	Little bit of advice. I would stay away from the tinfoil hat-wearing crazies in this town. You can do a lot better than that. 

ABBY	You’re avoiding the question. 

CHARLIE	Look, whatever you think you know… trust me, you don’t know anything.

ABBY	B.M….

CHARLIE	Abby! Abby!

ABBY	Oh, shit!

CHARLIE	Come on out, Abby!

ABBY	Shit!

CHARLIE	Excuse me, miss... 

OPERATOR	Hey, you have to buy a ticket.

ABBY	Okay, here...

CHARLIE	Abby, Abby, Abby.... Disappearing ink, really? You know I own the gag shop where you bought it. So, in case you haven’t figured it out, I own this town. And when I’m done with you, Walter and all his crazies, and your shitty little motel, it’s gonna be hilarious. So, if it’s games you want to play with me, we can play… ‘cause this is really, really easy for me.

ABBY	Okay, first of all, a ticket is twelve dollars  I paid twenty. And second of all, I’m the new liaison at CLC… soon to be. Ask Charlie. 


FEMALE COP	Mr. Lake’s the one who called in the complaint.

ABBY	It’s just a workplace misunderstanding. I’ll talk to him.

SINGH	What exactly does a liaison for CLC do, Miss West?

ABBY	What does any liaison do? Look it up.

FEMALE COP	Listen, ma’am, just stay away from CLC properties. And I’d stay away from Mr. Lake altogether. He didn’t press charges this time, but it’s probably safe to say you didn’t get the job.

SINGH	Have a good night, Miss West.

MARCUS	Hey, Abby. 

ABBY	Hey.

MARCUS	Yeah.

ABBY	Graveyard shift?

LAURE	Yeah. 

ABBY	So…? I knew it!

LAURE	Bev Mole banned from the casino in 1996.

ABBY	That’s her. 

LAURE	How did you know she’d be in our system?

ABBY	A lucky guess. A Bev Mole won the lottery in June 1995. Bought two hundred tickets. Who buys two hundred tickets? Also... read that.

LAURE	"The good news couldn’t have come at a better time. During a botched home invasion last October, Mole’s husband, Gerry, was violently assaulted paralyzing him from the waist down…” October?

ABBY	Maybe it was a double- cross. 

MARCUS	You guys having fun without me? Is this about that kidnapping?

AUTOMATED VOICE	We’re sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Call your Operator to help you.

OPERATOR	Operator. How can I help you?

ABBY	Hi. I’ve been trying to reach my aunt, but her number isn’t in service anymore. Could you put me through to the new one?

OPERATOR	Name and previous number?

ABBY 	Beverly Mole. 905-triple 5, zero, one, seven, three. 

OPERATOR	Please hold.

BEVERLY	Hello? 

ABBY	Is this Beverly Mole?

BEVERLY	Who’s asking? 

ABBY	Hi, Miss Mole. I’m from Customer Care at the Niagara Falls Casino.

BEVERLY	Okay... 

ABBY	Yeah. We noticed you haven’t played with us in a while. We wanted to try and lure you back.

ABBY	We noticed there was an improper ban on your account and we’d like to give you a hundred-dollar credit and a room. What do you think? 

BEVERLY	What do I have to do?

ABBY	Nothing at all. Just... let me know when you’d like to redeem it and I’ll process it. 

BEVERLY	Friday.

ABBY	This Friday?

BEVERLY 	Yeah.

ABBY	Of course. There’s a great little place we partner with.

MALE VOCALIST	Though you warned me not to drive To see you again I’m back at your door Please let me in I saw that little smile Playing on your face You knew I’d come running Back to your side But if you find it In your heart To love me still I’ll never be sorry I forgot about my pride I’m back just like I’ve never been away I’m back as...

ABBY	Welcome, Ms. Mole. Thanks for staying with us.

ABBY	Travelling far?

BEVERLY	Ajax. 

ABBY	Lovely. I need to see your license.

ABBY	I have you staying with us for two nights compliments of the Casino.

ABBY	Can I help with your bags?

BEVERLY	No.

MALE VOCALIST	I'm back just like I've never been away I'm back and you gotta let me stay Though you warned me not to try To see you again I'm back at your door Please let me in


GERRY	Who are you?

ABBY	Police.

GERRY	What?

ABBY	Police!

GERRY	She locked it. 

ABBY	Okay. I’ve got… gotta get you out of here.

GERRY	Thank you.

ABBY	Oh, shit. 

ABBY	Okay. Okay, first… I need you to tell me about Alex Moulin.

ABBY	Did Charles Lake send you?

GERRY	We took pictures.  Polaroids.

ABBY	Of what?

GERRY	The scars. His scars.

ABBY	Scars you gave him.

GERRY	No, they don’t like children.

ABBY	Who don’t?

GERRY	Tigers. 

ABBY	Who don't?

GERRY	Tigers. We only wanted the money. The Moulins needed to pay for what they did to him. And after he died...I tried to tell the police...but my wife 

ABBY	She stopped you?

GERRY	Yeah, she stopped me. The... the boy, he was fine when we left him.

ABBY	Left him?

GERRY	Yeah.

ABBY	Left him where?

BEVERLY	Ger!

ABBY	I can’t help you right now. But I will. I promise.

BEV	Fuckin’ scam! Ger! We're leavin’!

BEVERLY	Fuck!

BEVERLY	Sorry, sweetness. I know we just got here. The casino tried to entrap me. Motherfuckers. Fuck! Geez... We’re leaving this fuckin’ town. What a shit hole this is. Fuck! Come on. Come on, you fucker! Come on!

MR. MOULIN	In the desert I saw a creature, naked, bestial. Who, squatting on the ground, held her heart in his hands and ate of it!

MRS. MOULIN	I said, “Is it good, friend?”

MR. MOULIN	“It is bitter, bitter,” he answered. “But I like it because it is bitter, bitter. And..."

MR. MOULIN/MRS. MOULIN	"... because it is my heart.”

RANDY	Abby! Abby! Abby, what’s going on, kiddo? I got a call from the CLC lawyers. They’re taking the motel, Abby. It doesn’t matter whether you signed it in crayon, lipstick or invisible ink. It’s binding!

RANDY 	I've already talked to your sister. She sounded relieved, to be honest with you. Just take the money, kid. Get your life sorted.

ABBY	Did Mom really want to sell this place?

RANDY	Abby…

ABBY	Just tell me! She’s dead. Just tell me. 

RANDY	I can tell you that once the decision was made, she was at peace with it. That much I can tell you. MR. MOULIN Isn’t she beautiful?

ABBY	The Moulins were forcing Alex to be in their act. With the tiger! But there was a terrible accident so they locked him up and they hid him away. But Bev Mole, the animal trainer, she was the only outsider who knew. Does that name mean anything to you? 

WALTER	Nope.

ABBY	Well, Bev decides to take pictures of a scarred-up Alex and uses them to blackmail the Moulins. Everything goes according to plan until Alex somehow breaks free and runs away. So, Bev’s complicit in all this and she’s forced to track him down and take him back to the Moulins, but then he’s never heard from again.

WAITRESS	Bye, Walter.

WALTER	Good night, darlin’.

AUTOMATED VOICE	Alien life-form approaching.

WALTER	So, what are you implying?

ABBY	The Moulins killed their own kid. The abuse, the tiger attack, the blackmail

WALTER	Yeah, yeah, yeah...

ABBY	Cui prodest, right? Bev Mole and the Moulins are bound. It’s been a Cold War ever since.

WALTER	I thought you were a smart kid. I thought your eyes were open. 

ABBY	"Complete the picture." That’s what this is. It isn’t some dubious campaign against the Lake family.

WALTER	You think you know these people. 

ABBY	I’ve seen you driving by my motel. Snooping around. You’re paranoid.

WALTER	Don’t you mean CLC’s motel? Or maybe you just forgot to mention your pending land deal. Goodbye.

ABBY	Fuck! Fuck!

VOCALIST	...Once, once it was mine If love’s a tear I want to cry If it has wings I wanna fly I know I’d never, never let go Once, once it was mine If there’s a sip of wine I want to taste it This heart and these lips of mine Don’t want to be wasted If love’s a game I want to play If there’s a price I want to pay Let me at least...

MR. MOULIN	Thank you! Thank you and welcome to my show! 

MRS. MOULIN	What?!

MRS. MOULIN	Your show?! 

MR. MOULIN	Well... who’s show is it? 

MR. MOULIN	What is this?! What is going on? 

MRS. MOULIN	I think it is time to teach this animal a lesson! What do you think?

MRS. MOULIN	Bye. One, two, three!

MRS. MOULIN	The amazing Heka! Isn’t she beautiful? She loves your applause. 

MRS. MOULIN	We adopted her when she was six months old. Her mother died, she was left all alone. Abandoned. Hungry. But she’s a fighter!

MRS. MOULIN	Isn’t that right, Heka? What, Heka?

MRS. MOULIN	Did I hear that?  You miss Mr. Moulin?

MRS. MOULIN	She wants me to bring him back.

MRS. MOULIN	Do I have to? Okay. Mr. Moulin! Where are you?

ABBY	You guys... wow!

MRS. MOULIN	You’re way too kind! Who should I make it out to?

ABBY	Just make it out to Alex.

ABBY	I’ll be at the diner across the street.

VOCALIST	Won't you break my heart One more time Won't you kiss my lips One more time I'll be back when I know What I'll find You'll just break my heart One more time

ABBY	I don’t think you can smoke here.

WAITRESS	Coffee, Mrs. Moulin?

MRS. MOULIN	No.

VOCALIST	Do me wrong I don't care 

ABBY	Touching story about the tiger. I even saw some tears. Imagine the reaction if you told them about your dead son. How’d you do it?

MRS. MOULIN	It’s been twenty-five years. We’ve learned to adjust.

ABBY	I mean the tiger trick. It’s really spectacular.

MR. MOULIN	Look, what exactly do you want? 

MRS. MOULIN	She wants money…

MRS. MOULIN	imbecile! She sent you? Tell her she won’t get another grubby dime from us. We’ve got Chernobyl of dirt on her compared to that.

WAITRESS	Can I get anybody something

MRS. MOULIN	No, fuck off!

MRS. MOULIN	That woman stole from us. Blackmailed us, she almost ruined our careers!

ABBY	Not to mention, kidnapped your son.

MRS. MOULIN	She didn’t send you?

VOCALIST	You'll need a friend But there won't be...

ABBY	Keep it.  I have the originals.

MR. MOULIN	Well, how much?

ABBY	I don’t want money. I want the truth.

MRS. MOULIN	Truth. You’re pretty smart?  But what you’re doing here is fucking dopey. But I’ll admit you do it with a certain exuberance.

ABBY	You’re stalling.

MRS. MOULIN	The truth. 

MR. MOULIN	The truth.

MRS. MOULIN	The truth...

MR. MOULIN	The truth is... we don’t know. We paid her the money. The deal was she would take him back to the farm. But he never got there. We went to the police. They told us he committed suicide. They didn’t want to listen to us! Now, that Chicken hawk Charles Lake...was trying to send us a message. The police... and that bitch Beverly, they were all on the payroll.

ABBY	What message?

MR. MOULIN	He took my boy. Mon bébé. 

MR. MOULIN	Mon petit garcon. 

MRS. MOULIN	The truth...he was there...tied up in his little cage. Half-conscious. And we saw an opportunity. We tried to teach Alex, tried to include him. But he was spoiled, soft. Tigers bow to strength. Fear only makes them salivate. It was really his fault more than the tiger’s. It could have sent him over the cliff. The body breaks up on the rocks. The sad child does what sad children do. 

MRS. MOULIN	I’ll have some coffee please, now. Thank you.

MRS. MOULIN	Feels good to get that off our chest, doesn’t it, boy? 

MR. MOULIN	Yeah.

MRS. MOULIN	There you have it, the truth...and a lie. You have to decide which is which. More homework, I’m afraid. 

MRS. MOULIN	Don’t be embarrassed, honey. Don’t.

MRS. MOULIN	It’s smoke and mirrors, by the way, the trick.

MRS. MOULIN	We drop a mirror between Heka and the audience. A little redirection... a little light…

MRS. MOULIN	Go ahead… tell someone. See if they believe you. Now scram.

MR. MOULIN	Scram!

BORDER OFFICER	Whoa, whoa. Slow down!

BORDER OFFICER	How long were you in the States?

SINGH	Abby, this is strictly voluntary. Your sister has graciously agreed to take you in for the time being.However, I think you owe her an explanation as to what you were doing with her passport.

RANDY	It’s okay, Abby.

LAURE	My sister has these... cycles. 

SINGH	Laure, do you know what your sister was doing before she came back home?

LAURE	She mentioned something about bumming around Toronto with a… a boyfriend and fucking that all up, or...

LAURE	What is this? 

RANDY	That is Abby’s last cycle. She was in Phoenix, Arizona, the last eighteen months claiming that she had retrograde amnesia. Do you know what that is?

SINGH	It’s when you hit your head and lose all memory of anything that happened before the injury.

RANDY	She convinced people she didn’t know who she was. Her name, her family, anything.

RANDY	People thought that she’d escaped some human trafficking ring. And then a local caseworker made Abby his pet cause, trying to get the state to issue her an ID. It was a bit of a story down there. The press dubbed her “Jane of the Desert”.

TITLE	"JANE OF THE DESERT" WAS A MIRAGE AFTER ALL And then once she got exposed, it got pretty messy, as you can imagine. Lawyers, psychiatrists, meds. The deportation. She was banned from ever going back into the United States. And it was your mom who came to her rescue.

LAURE	Mom? She paid for all this? 

RANDY	Yes. With a loan against the sale of the motel. 

LAURE	Why didn’t she tell me?

RANDY	Because she was afraid it was going to tear the two of you apart, permanently. This had a real cost on your mom.
TITLE	"'JANE OF THE DESERT' BURNED ME," SAYS DANIEL ESQUIBEL

LAURE	Abby... you are my sister and I love you, despite everything. Just look me in the eye and tell me you did this. That’s all.

ABBY	I got them, Laure. They told me.

LAURE	Who? Who told you what? 

ABBY	The Moulins.

LAURE	No, Abby, we are not… we are not doing this.

ABBY	So you don’t believe any of this now? 

LAURE	Just tell me you’ll get help, I will be there the whole way.

ABBY	They laid it all out for me. They told me how they killed him and why. It’s means, motive, opportunity!

LAURE	Stop it!  
ABBY	The Moulins! You have to bring them in for questioning! 

LAURE	The Moulins? I thought Alex was whacked by some evil consortium

ABBY	I got the whole story, Laure!

LAURE	I’m sure it’s very interesting. But it just doesn’t add up.

SINGH	Abby, why can’t you just admit what you did in Phoenix? 

ABBY	Because I’m not… Because I was protecting myself. 

ABBY	I’m not a liar. I’m not.  

ACTOR #1	…under the circumstances that you have a perfect right.

ACTOR #2	You do?

ACTOR #1	Well, I wouldn’t want to do it without a witness.

ACTOR #2	Well, that’s me.

ACTOR #1	It is? Well, that’s all I wanted to know...

BEVERLY	All right. Bye, babe. See you.

WOMAN	...and I felt like if I could just move my head over a little bit I could see who it is.

ABBY	Calm down. It’s okay. Don’t panic… Please. I just want to talk to you. Okay.

ABBY	I want to show you something. Look at these. 

GERRY	What?

ABBY	I need you to look at these, please. You remember that day? This is me. 

GERRY	I don’t

ABBY	Look. Look, please!

ABBY	You see?

ABBY	You remember this day?

ABBY	You want to make it right again?

GERRY	I do... I just...

ABBY	Yeah. I can get you out of here. But I need you to do something for me.

GERRY	Yeah.

ABBY	You understand?

WALTER	Ndio, kwe and yineh to the “Over the Falls” podcast. Recorded live from the hangar deck of Niagara’s only flying saucer. I’m Walter Bell. And, folks, as Lawrence Welk would say, “It’s wonderful, wonderful to be here.

BEVERLY	Get the fuck out of my house!

WALTER	We have a very special episode for you today. Our long-time listeners will surely know why. For over 20 years I’ve been telling the police that Charles Lake II had Alex Moulin murdered  all to protect his son, current CLC boss Charles III and his elicit taste for young, vulnerable boys. We fought a long and bloody battle to bring retribution to this criminal clan. So, today, I’m proud to say we are on the cusp of victory.

FIELD REPORTER	This sleepy neighbourhood in the suburban town of Ajax,
45 minutes outside of Toronto, was shaken by the sounds of a police raid
as officers charged into this bungalow behind me.
Inside, 58-year-old retiree, Beverly Mole, was arrested for the forcible confinement
and suspected torture of her physically disabled husband.
However, when police talked to the victim, 51-year-old Gerry Mole,
he dropped a bombshell no one saw coming.
According to Gerry, his wife was the hired gun
for a ghastly crime that took place almost 25 years ago. A crime she committed on behalf of the now-deceased Niagara Falls tycoon

TITLE	CLC plans new development, says Lake III 

FIELD REPORTER	Charles Lake II.

TITLE	BREAKING NEWS CHARLES LAKE II DECEASED NIAGARA FALLS MOGUL

FIELD REPORTER	A crime that, until now, wasn’t even a crime at all.

WALTER	Who could have fathomed such a fate for young Alex? Tortured by his parents, defiled by a deviant then fed to a den of tigers like some ritual slaughter. Truly, this was a masterpiece of degeneracy.

MRS. MOULIN	We did not know about the abuse. We certainly did not know about his murder. We intend to fight this gross, malicious slander.

FIELD REPORTER	Someone who was willing to comment was this man, Walter Bell, who many in the region would recognize as a member of the local daredevil and water rescue team, The Diving Bells.
Walter was a part of the original search-party that scoured the Niagara River for any evidence of Alex Moulin’s remains. According to Walter, something seemed off immediately.

WALTER	Of course, Alex wasn’t the first. We’ve only started to scratch the surface on the story, believe me. I also have a podcast. It’s called “Over the Falls”.

WALTER	As we await the outcome of this re-opened investigation, I remind my listeners of our long fight for justice against nepotism, beguiling iniquity and bloodshed. To everyone that stuck with us, thus always to tyrants.
