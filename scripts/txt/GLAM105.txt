AINA	My name is Aina, which means ‘INFINITE’. I have come from very far away to bring grace, freshness and beauty into this world...

AINA	(coughs)I have a lot of work to do, I know... 

CARMEN	This is a very special cake. The recipe is a secret: only my grandmother and I know it. Do you want some?

REBECCA	(Reaction)…No thank you, the last time you gave me banana and sardine biscuits to try, blah! 

AINA	I’ll eat it, uh, there aren’t any sardines inside, are there?

CARMEN	No, no I swear!

AINA	Mmm it’s good. I can eat everything except for almonds(speaks with mouth full) 

CARMEN	Noooo. Don’t say it...

ALL THREE	Almonddddddds!

REBECCA	You’re so good at this!

CARMEN	You’ll see, I’ll cover everything up.

AINA	Cotton...fine brush...eyelash curler...light corrector...

BOHEME	(Reaction) Aina? What a nice make-up job... You look like a singer! A+

AINA	Sometimes bad things turns out pretty good!
