OWEN	First time we hung out, what did I think of you?

HALLIE	Yeah.

OWEN	When was that?  Was that the night that…

HALLIE	Come on, you're kidding.

HALLIE	Remember, I brought Willa over to that apartment you and Matt had

HALLIE	in the East Village?

OWEN	Yes, of course I remember.

OWEN	Let's see.  I thought that you were really hot

OWEN	but also that you may murder me in my sleep one day.

HALLIE	Shut up.

OWEN	You want one teabag or two?

HALLIE	That's it? You just you thought I was hot?

OWEN	Yeah. You know, I mean, I had never seen you naked before.

OWEN	That was a great night.

OWEN	I fucking miss New York.

HALLIE	When we were there, you missed LA.

OWEN	Okay. I remember looking at you that night

OWEN	and thinking you weren't like anyone I'd ever met before.

OWEN	I thought that you were very special.

OWEN	Do you want honey?

HALLIE	One teabag and yeah, honey.

HALLIE	Aren't you gonna ask me what I thought?

OWEN	Oh. Yeah, sure.

HALLIE	Never mind.

OWEN	Okay. Here's your tea.

HALLIE	You really need to get rid of this couch.

OWEN	I can't do that. I'm sorry.

HALLIE	Well, it's old and it's disgusting…

OWEN	I like it too much.

HALLIE	…and even Goodwill would reject it at this point,

HALLIE	so I think it's time for you to take it upon yourself.

OWEN	To just do whatever you want me to do at all times of the day?

HALLIE	Yeah. Please?

OWEN	Hmm. Look at you.

HALLIE	Wait, stop, stop.

OWEN	What?

HALLIE	I think my NuvaRing fell out.

OWEN	What?

HALLIE	I don't know.

HALLIE	I don't feel like it's in there.

OWEN	You can feel that?

OWEN	What does it look like?

HALLIE	Like a glow bracelet.

OWEN	It's not in the hat.

OWEN	Is that it?

HALLIE	You know what's on HBO GO?

OWEN	What?

HALLIE	That Stephen Hawking movie.

OWEN	But we were just, like, fucking.  You wanna watch that?

HALLIE	Uh-hmm. I don't feel good.

OWEN	Really? I just…

HALLIE	Please?

OWEN	I can't go

OWEN	from almost fucking to Hawking.

OWEN	I can't. I just can't.

HALLIE	Okay, I know.

OWEN	Only because you're sick.

SINGER	Do you remember…

SINGER	…the night that we first met?

OWEN	Oh, shit. What time is it?

OWEN	Matty's out front. I told him he could ride with us to Malibu.

HALLIE	We really need to find him a girlfriend.

OWEN	What about your cousin?

HALLIE	Willa? She'd eat him up like a praying mantis.

HALLIE	Hi, are you at mine?

WILLA	Hey, I made it. Let me in.

HALLIE	I slept at Owen's actually. Sorry.  But I left you a key in the flower pot.

HALLIE	We're leaving soon, so just meet us in Malibu.

MATT	Oh, uh, child lock.

HALLIE	Oh, sorry. Child lock.

MATT	Thank you.

OWEN	Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. There you go.

MATT	Was it too many?

OWEN	Yeah.

MATT	Looks good?

OWEN	Yeah.

OWEN	Got to get you some sun before Willa gets here, you know?

OWEN	You look like Tilda Swinton.

OWEN	Do you want some?

HALLIE	No, I don't.

HALLIE	I don't like it. It's gross.  Everyone puts their hands in there.

OWEN	But it's the good stuff.

HALLIE	No, it's not. It's all in your teeth.

MATT	So when does your hot cousin get here?

HALLIE	Okay. No. She literally just moved here.

HALLIE	Do not go pulling a Matt on her. It will not end well for you.

OWEN	She's hot.

MATT	She is hot.

MATT	And she's coming, right?

HALLIE	Yeah, she's in an Uber. Are you happy?

MAN	Hallie.

HALLIE	Hey. Oh, hi.

MAN	Glad you guys made it.  Would you like a beer?

HALLIE	Yeah. Thanks.

OWEN	I'd love one. Thanks.

MAN	Cool.

OWEN	Honestly, I got to fucking pee so bad.

OWEN	You wanna bet you break the seal before I do?

OWEN	If you win, I'll convince Hallie to talk you up with Willa.

OWEN	And if I win, you have to give me your Bang Bros. password.

MATT	Pfft. Deal.

OWEN	Done. You are one lucky fuck, you know that?

MATT	What?

OWEN	I'm just saying.

OWEN	You're free. You're free. I wish I was.

MATT	You wish you were free?  All right, fucking Ted Nugent,

MATT	well, you wanna know what I do with my freedom?

MATT	Last night, I ate an entire rotisserie chicken

MATT	and diarrhea'd like 12 times.

MATT	I only had three hours sleep because I had such bad diarrhea.

OWEN	Uh-huh.

HALLIE	Hey. I love you.

OWEN	What was that?

HALLIE	What?

OWEN	What were you guys doing?

HALLIE	Don't be crazy.

OWEN	What, you think he's photogenic?  You think that…

MATT	Oh, fuck this. I lose.

OWEN	Honestly, you embarrass me

OWEN	in front of my friends.

HALLIE	He's not like doing anything.

HALLIE	Stop being crazy and have fun.

WILLA	Oh my God. Oh my God.

MATT	Oh my God. I am so sorry, Willa.

WILLA	Wait, how do you know my name?

MATT	Oh, we've met, uh, several times.

MATT	I'm Owen's best friend, Matt.

WILLA	Oh, yeah. Shit. Sorry.  I'm just really bad with names and faces.

MATT	So, like, people?

WILLA	I guess. Now we really know each other.

WILLA	Hi.

HALLIE	Hi, babe. Look at us, just meeting up.  So casual.

MATT	Stop. Stop.

SINGER	Bright lights, feel all right.

SINGER	I'm gonna see her again tonight.

SINGER	But then I see you and I wanna go where the beach is warm

SINGER	and I won't get stung and I won't get stung by memories of you.

SINGER	Baby, is this how you feel.

SINGER	I wanna know, wanna know is this how you feel.

SINGER	I wanna know, wanna know, is this how you feel.

SINGER	I wanna know, I wanna know, is this how you feel, baby?

SINGER	Is this how you feel?

SINGER	Is this how you feel?

SINGER	Is this how you feel?

OWEN	Hey. Hey. Why are you acting so weird?

HALLIE	I'm fine. Maybe let's just go home soon.

OWEN	What, you don't wanna watch the fireworks…

MATT	This is a way better spot.  The walk is gonna be worth it.

HALLIE	You're insane. Are you serious?  You're actually insane.

HALLIE	I don't feel great and I wanna go and I want you to wanna go too.

OWEN	It's the Fourth of July.  Can't we just 

OWEN	can't we just celebrate the Declaration of Independence

OWEN	without you having a manic fucking episode?

HALLIE	I also think I left a candle burning and it's haunted me all afternoon.

OWEN	That's never happened.  That never happened.

HALLIE	It happened once.

OWEN	That happened once in your life…

HALLIE	I can't focus on anything else.

HALLIE	Okay. Also lower your voice, okay?  Everybody can hear us.

OWEN	Nobody can hear us. Nobody cares.

OWEN	Everybody's outside watching the fucking fireworks display

OWEN	which, by the way, I would like to be doing right now.

HALLIE	People can hear us and it's embarrassing for both of us.

OWEN	Stop pretending you care about something

OWEN	just so you can be mad about it.

HALLIE	I'm not 

HALLIE	you know what?  Why don't you learn how to apologize

HALLIE	without having a whole comeback?

OWEN	We fight at every fucking party.

MATT	I honestly feel like I'm like 14.  This is too exciting.

MATT	Just me? Okay. Cool. I like those ones.

WILLA	The glittery ones?

MATT	Yeah.

OWEN	You wanna watch It's Complicated?

OWEN	I'll fall asleep to whatever you want. Hey.

HALLIE	What?

OWEN	Hey.

WILLA	Okay. So how do we know each other?

MATT	Oh. Well, Owen and Hallie and I went to school in New York,

MATT	so I guess probably when you came to visit sometime maybe?

WILLA	Okay. I vaguely remember that.

MATT	Yeah. You guys came over to me and Owen's place in East Village

MATT	after some party and you and I hung out and drank Brooklyn Lager

MATT	while it snowed and watched the sun come up.

MATT	I mean, yeah, I think it was.  I don't really remember.

MATT	It was a long time ago.

WILLA	No, yes. Wait.

WILLA	That was the first night that Hallie and Owen hooked up, right?

MATT	Yeah, right.

WILLA	Yeah.

WILLA	Wait, where are they anyway?

MATT	Oh, Owen just texted me.  They had to leave.

WILLA	Yeah, I should probably get going soon too.

MATT	I just remembered.  I left my car at Owen's.

MATT	Do you think maybe I could get a ride?

WILLA	Yeah, I don't have a car.  I'm just Ubering for right now.

MATT	Oh, well, you want me to get us one back to the mainland?

MATT	I mean, I'm on my way to Hallie's.  You can drop me.

WILLA	Okay. But split it with me because I'm sure it's fucking expensive.

MATT	No, stop. Don't be silly.

WILLA	Are you sure?

MATT	Yeah. Honestly, my treat.

OWEN	You know what time I think it is?

HALLIE	What?

OWEN	How about this, huh?

OWEN	A little bit of swivel hips.

OWEN	You like my get down for you, mama, like that?

OWEN	Gonna get nice and deep for you tonight, baby.

OWEN	There you go, nice and deep, good angles.

HALLIE	Stop!

HALLIE	You're insane.

OWEN	You gotta have the rhythm, you know?

HALLIE	You don't have a lot of rhythm.

HALLIE	I think you're done, you're done.

OWEN	I didn't shower, should I?

HALLIE	Yeah.

OWEN	Aw fuck, they're increasing the rent to this place in September.

OWEN	I'm not gonna be able to afford this.  I'm probably gonna have to move.

HALLIE	I'm sorry, that's awful.

OWEN	Between the rent for this place,

OWEN	my student loans, my Propecia.

OWEN	I can't.

HALLIE	Well, one way you could keep living here

HALLIE	is if I moved in officially.

HALLIE	I mean, I know we haven't we haven't talked about it in a while,

HALLIE	um, and I know it's not your favorite subject but let's just move in together.

HALLIE	I mean, I love Clara, but I'm too old for a roommate

HALLIE	and I'm over here all the time, anyway.

HALLIE	It just kind of makes sense, you know?

MATT	Holy shit.

WILLA	Oh my God.

WILLA	Okay.

MATT	After you.

WILLA	Thanks.

WILLA	Oh.

MATT	Oh.

WILLA	Okay.

WILLA	Happy Fourth!

MATT	Hey!

MATT	Nice car.

WILLA	I can't believe you actually grew up in LA.  I feel like nobody does.

MATT	Yeah, me and Owen both did.

MATT	What about you?  What did you move out here for?

WILLA	Well, I've been living in New York since school

WILLA	but I'm actually going to grad school in September.

WILLA	Comp Lit. USC.

MATT	Wow, I'm impressed.

MATT	I've read maybe four whole books in my entire life

MATT	and I wouldn't know how to compare them.

WILLA	I wouldn't admit that.

MATT	Oh, this is me.

MATT	Thanks.

WILLA	Whoa, you live here?

MATT	Yeah, this is my spot.

WILLA	Well, good night.

MATT	Yeah, night.  It was it was nice to see you again.

MATT	Um, hey, let me get your number real quick.

WILLA	Yeah, sure.

MATT	Sorry.

SINGER	I feel it. Yeah, yeah. I feel it.

SINGER	I feel it. Yeah, yeah. I feel it.

MATT	Purple devil, I use that one a lot.

SINGER	I feel it. I feel it. I feel it.

SINGER	I feel it in my body.

SINGER	Yeah, yeah. I feel it. I feel it in the bed.

SINGER	I feel it. I feel it on the mouth.

SINGER	Yeah, yeah. I feel it. I feel it in the air,

SINGER	in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air.

MATT	Oh. Here you go, after you.

WILLA	Whoa, do you have roommates?

MATT	This is my parents' place, actually.  They're out of town, at the moment.

WILLA	Ooh, got the house to ourselves.

WILLA	Okay, you have to take off those flip-flops.

WILLA	Holy shit, are those rocket ship sheets?

MATT	Hey, look, some girls think it's adorable, what can I say?

WILLA	And your books are color-coded?

MATT	Okay, look, I was in a dark place after college.

MATT	Stop looking at my room, please?

WILLA	How do your parents let you live like this? It's inhumane.

MATT	Honestly, I wanna get a bigger bed,

MATT	but it just it feels kind of symbolic at this point, you know.

MATT	Like I'm saying, "Guys, I'm here to stay!  I'm never moving out!"

MATT	You know, the  the twin bed kind of keeps that dream alive.

WILLA	Maybe don't feel like you have to talk all the time.

MATT	Right. Gotcha.

MATT	Do you like these guys? DJDS?

MATT	Ah, sorry, the mesh is kind of chafing on these.

WILLA	Hey, I don't think we should have sex, is that okay?

WILLA	Just  I just 

WILLA	not until we know each other.

WILLA	I just don't like to have sex when I first meet somebody.

MATT	Oh, that's  honestly, I'm I'm just happy to be here.

WILLA	But like should we have sex?  We shouldn't have sex, right?

MATT	I mean, I wouldn't not have sex with you right now.

MATT	But I'm also not in any hurry, so…

WILLA	Maybe we should just have sex and get it over with.

MATT	I don't have a condom.

WILLA	It's cool, I have an IUD.

MATT	Okay.

MATT	All right.

MATT	I'm sorry about my twin bed.

WILLA	I mean, I feel like a pedophile.

MATT	Uh, what?

WILLA	It's fine, just fuck me.

MATT	Okay. Wow.

MATT	You want me to go get a towel?

WILLA	Sure.

MATT	The Uber back from Malibu cost, no joke,

MATT	a hundred and thirty-seven dollars.

OWEN	Wait, wait, wait, how quickly did you cum?

MATT	Dude.

OWEN	Just tell me how quick? How quick was it?	

MATT	It was like 45 seconds.

OWEN	Oh, that's actually longer than I would've guessed.

MATT	I apologized, and we watched Shark Tank.

MAGGIE	Oh, my God, you guys are fucking vile, you know that?

MATT	Maggie, I met an amazing girl!

MAGGIE	Yeah, you sound like Jimmy Stewart the way you're talking about her.

OWEN	He legit just hooked up with this girl

OWEN	and he's talking about how much he loves her.

OWEN	You're like  it's less than 24 hours ago

OWEN	and you're talking about how she's your "future wife."

OWEN	You fucking psycho. You poor psycho.

MAGGIE	Aww.

MATT	You think I just met her?

MATT	She and I had this unbelievable before sunrise-level night like five years ago,

MATT	we just finally reconnected.

OWEN	No, you didn't, no you didn't

OWEN	because she has no recollection of that night ever happening.

MAGGIE	Whoa, whoa, whoa, Owen, you shouldn't talk.

MAGGIE	This guy, this guy plagiarized Dashboard Confessional lyrics…

OWEN	All right.

MAGGIE	…and said you wrote them about me,

MAGGIE	so…

OWEN	Well, number one,

OWEN	I had a very big crush on you. Number two, it was ninth grade.

MAGGIE	Huge.

OWEN	Number three,

OWEN	the Dashboard lyrics articulated something

OWEN	that 14-year-old me wasn't able to articulate at the time.

MATT	Honestly, I haven't liked anyone this much since, I don't know,

MATT	since Rachel Flegelman!

OWEN	Flegelman, the girl, who every time you guys did coke would lick your butthole.

MATT	Yeah.

MAGGIE	Jesus!

MATT	Hey, butthole licking is part of the human experience!

MAGGIE	I don't want to hear more about that. Are you out of your minds right now?

OWEN	Maggie, how are you, what's going on?

MAGGIE	Oh, my God, I'm so good.

OWEN	You look great. I can't I can't believe you're pregnant.

MAGGIE	Thanks. Thanks, man.

MAGGIE	Literally, two seconds pregnant.  How are you, how's your lady, Hallie?

OWEN	She's good, she's really good.

OWEN	I mean, she just asked me to move in the other night

OWEN	and I didn't know what to say

OWEN	and that was obviously not a good reaction on my part.

MAGGIE	Ugh, buddy, that's not a good sign.

OWEN	I don't know, it feels like we're on auto pilot or something,

OWEN	you know what I mean?  And it's like when you say a word

OWEN	over and over and over again and it starts to lose its meaning.

OWEN	If that's where it feels like we're at.

MAGGIE	Listen, you're scared, that's okay.  It's not love unless you're scared.

WILLA	Jakob, hey, it's Willa.

WILLA	No, I was just calling to see if we're going to that thing.

WILLA	Oh, um, yeah, yeah.

WILLA	Yeah, we'll hang out soon.

WILLA	Bye.

SASHA (singing)	It's that Target commercial kind of voice.

SASHA (singing)	It's kind of Huggies, it's more Dove.

SASHA (singing)	It gets you in the mood for love.

HALLIE	I mean, I'm sorry, he's in love with you.

HALLIE	But you know it's cute that he's calling.

HALLIE	He's like taking charge.

WILLA	Yeah, but it's just so weird when you're texting

WILLA	and then they just call.

WILLA	Hey, Matt, what's up?

WILLA	I am so sorry. I'm late.  I couldn't find parking anywhere.

WILLA	I literally ended up parking at a fire hydrant.

MATT	Nice, you got a car!

MATT	Are you sure you don't wanna find a better spot?

WILLA	No, it's fine, I do it all the time.

WILLA	Sorry. Hold on, I'm so rude, one sec.

WILLA	Okay. I swear I'm done, sorry.

MATT	Don't worry about it.  Is everything okay?

WILLA	Yeah, no, have you seen this OJ show? I'm obsessed.

MATT	Wait, the eight-hour doc or the Cuba Gooding Jr. one?

WILLA	The doc.

MATT	How fucking good is it?

WILLA	No, it's amazing.

MATT	I know, right?  Uh, what do you wanna drink?

WILLA	Uh, vodka water, like a vodka soda, but with water.

MATT	Wow, got it, kind of intense.

MATT	Um, yeah, could I get a vodka water, please?

MATT	And a, uh, whatever's just the lightest beer you have.

MATT	Thank you.

HALLIE	I said that's fun (indistinct) and I'll be like…

OWEN	Should I call you a nice person?

HALLIE	And I'm not a nice person?

OWEN	I don't think so.

HALLIE	This is how the conversation went last time.

WILLA	Not at all, it says you're a raging pussy.

MATT	Yeah.

MATT	This is fun, right?

MATT	Man, I shouldn't be dating somebody, since I'm literally afraid

MATT	to check my ATM balance, but…

MATT	What?

MATT	What?

OWEN	Well, I mean, like…

OWEN	are  are you guys actually dating?

MATT	Pfft, yeah!

MATT	I mean, yeah. Definitely.

OWEN	Does she know that?

MATT	Dude, fuck you, man.

OWEN	Because usually when you're dating somebody

OWEN	that's like a mutual, consensual decision.

OWEN	It's not like a it's not like a made up thing

OWEN	in somebody's head, you know?

OWEN	Just saying, early days, you know?

HALLIE	I don't know, I think breakfast is serious.

WILLA	I mean, I wouldn't say that we're dating.

HALLIE	So  so what are you doing?

WILLA	You know, hanging out.

HALLIE	OOh. Ha.

WILLA	What?

HALLIE	Ha, yikes.

HALLIE	If I heard a guy I liked, be like, "Yeah, we're hanging out."

HALLIE	I would literally be like, like kill me right there.

WILLA	Well, we're lucky you're not single.

HALLIE	I don't wanna be single. I mean, like I do, but I don't.

HALLIE	And I don't, that's  that's not about me.

WILLA	We are lucky you are not single.

WILLA	They'd like hold your hand or touch you

WILLA	and you'd be like, "We're dating!"

HALLIE	I feel like when you meet someone,

HALLIE	you know if you're gonna love them or not.

WILLA	What, you went straight into "We're married?"

HALLIE	Yeah.

WILLA	Of course, you did.

HALLIE	I literally  I assumed we were together from like the-the night we had sex.

HALLIE	I don't know. His  his idea of when we started dating from my idea,

HALLIE	it's not like months or days different.

HALLIE	It's like  like, we're talking, like, gaps of years

HALLIE	that he thought we weren't together that we were fully together.

HALLIE	I'm like, "If we're not together, what else are you doing?"

HALLIE	We're together every night, so…

WILLA	Jesus, you guys are fucked.

HALLIE	What?

WILLA	I feel I want to say, I could be drunk.

SINGER	(indistinct) with your words

SINGER	and (indistinct)

SINGER	we only come (indistinct)

SINGER	the words in my mind.

HALLIE	Oh my God.

HALLIE	Holy shit, I  I  I got in!

OWEN	You got into where?

HALLIE	Um, the  a photograph of mine got into this group show

HALLIE	that's gonna be in a month.

OWEN	Oh my God. That's so cool. Congrats.

HALLIE	Yeah. I sent it in like…

OWEN	Keep talking. I'm just getting a a little sip of water.

OWEN	You want? I'm listening.

HALLIE	No. I'm good. Never mind.

OWEN	You know, I think I'm done editing the bar mitzvah video

OWEN	so I can finally get that fucking check.

OWEN	The parents loved it though.

OWEN	They still have to show it to the bar mitzvah boy

OWEN	before we picture lock, but I think that's just a formality.

HALLIE	Good morning.

OWEN	Uh-uh.

OWEN	Hmm.

OWEN	Hmm.

OWEN	Hmm.

HALLIE	You know, last week I read an article that women in prison

HALLIE	are more violent than men when it's that time of the month.

HALLIE	They'll literally just start beating each other up.

HALLIE	And sometimes they even murder each other because of their fucking periods.

OWEN	When did we say about fast talking in the morning?

OWEN	We don't like it.

HALLIE	Okay, that's enough.

OWEN	What?

HALLIE	You're like grinding your boner all over me.

OWEN	That's not  that's not because of you.  That's not a sex boner.

OWEN	That's just a  a  a night morning boner.

HALLIE	Oh, thank you so much for clarifying.

MAN	I'm dying. And she still hasn't responded.

HALLIE	Stop, look, see, the whites with the colors?

OWEN	Like it really matters.

HALLIE	The text is out there. It's fine.

HALLIE	I mean, she doesn't even respond to me sometimes for like a day, so…

MAN	I'm sorry. I'm being insane. You're right.  Thanks. I'll  I'll keep you updated.

HALLIE	Bye.

HALLIE	Ugh.

HALLIE	Are you actually still working on that bar mitzvah video?

OWEN	Yeah. The guy is paying me to reopen the edit

OWEN	because his son had more notes.

OWEN	Kid thinks he's the next frickin' Kuprick.

OWEN	Do you wanna watch the next cut with me in a little?

HALLIE	Not really.

OWEN	I honestly think it was better yesterday, but what the fuck do I know?

OWEN	I'm just the editor, right?

HALLIE	So, that's it? We're just we're just done talking about it?

OWEN	Can we just  can we just watch?

HALLIE	Look. I don't wanna watch…

OWEN	No. Really, 'cause I have…

HALLIE	…this for the 10th time. Okay?

OWEN	I have  it's he needs it by tomorrow.

HALLIE	I wanna talk.

HALLIE	So, you just flat out don't wanna live with me.

HALLIE	I mean, I'm sorry, but I just think it's a little weird

HALLIE	that you're not even considering it.

OWEN	Of course, I've considered it, just…

HALLIE	Oh, thank you so much.

OWEN	What?

HALLIE	I'm sorry you don't wanna move in, but thank you for considering.

OWEN	Holy crap. Are you just gonna hang on to the one thing that I've said

OWEN	because that's what people do when they wanna fight.

OWEN	So, you just wanna  I  I  I  I wanna solve this, okay?

HALLIE	Oh, you are such an asshole!

OWEN	I really do.

OWEN	Don't you think if we moved in,

OWEN	we would never move out?

OWEN	Don't you wanna have things to build towards or  or things to look forward to

OWEN	or maybe there are things we're missing out on

OWEN	or things that we wanna try, like, before we 

OWEN	ugh! Look, I love you.

OWEN	You know I love you.

OWEN	Right now, I'm just  I'm not  I'm not ready to settle down.

OWEN	I'm just not.

HALLIE	I'm not talking about settling down.

HALLIE	I'm talking about living together.
HALLIE	Look, I  I  I  I love you.  I  I love you too.

HALLIE	I just  I  yeah, I don't wanna force it, I  I guess.

OWEN	Exactly. I don't wanna force it either.

HALLIE	Okay. But what are you saying when you  when you say that?

HALLIE	Because it sounds like you're saying

HALLIE	you wanna have like  like a break or something.

OWEN	Well, but  okay.  Things haven't felt right.

OWEN	You know that they haven't felt right.

HALLIE	Yeah. I know how things haven't felt.

HALLIE	Okay? I know.

OWEN	Things haven't felt right, so it's okay.

OWEN	So, you know, right. So, then I I don't wanna move in together.

OWEN	I just  I'm  I'm sorry. I don't.

HALLIE	And what if I hadn't said anything, huh?  We'd just be laying in bed

HALLIE	watching your stupid fucking bar mitzvah video for the 20th time?

HALLIE	We were in a fight and now you're breaking up with me.

HALLIE	And it's like we fight all the time.  You don't need to break up with me.

OWEN	It's not  don't  please don't say that.  Please don't say break up.

OWEN	That's not what this is.  This is just me needing time.

OWEN	I just need time.

HALLIE	Some time of not being together.

OWEN	Will you stay over?

HALLIE	You know, you wanna be alone?  Then be alone.

HALLIE	Oh, of fucking course!

WILLA	Hal, what are you doing here?

HALLIE	I live here, asshole!

MATT	Uh, Hal, you all right?

HALLIE	Get the fuck out of here!

MATT	We should go. She sounds pretty upset.

WILLA	She means you.

MATT	Oh, right. She wants me to go, fuck.

WILLA	Go!

WILLA	Hal?

OWEN	Rachel Flegelman, a blast from the past.

OWEN	Maybe we shouldn't tell Matt about this.

RACHEL	Matt who?

OWEN	Never mind.

RACHEL	Hey, do you wanna, um, get brunch?

OWEN	Um…

WILLA	Hallie. Do a shot with me.

HALLIE	Gross. That's from Clare's birthday like two years ago.

HALLIE	And, plus, it's 3:00 PM.

WILLA	Yeah, exactly. It's 3:00 PM and you're staring at the trees

WILLA	like you're in a Cymbalta commercial.

HALLIE	Willa, I am on a break with the guy

HALLIE	who I thought I was going to marry.

HALLIE	Please just give me some motherfucking time.

WILLA	Okay. I'm sorry.  Look, I just wanna make you happy.

WILLA	What will make you happy?

WILLA	There's my girl.

WILLA	Thank you.

HALLIE	Can we look at pictures of sushi on Yelp?

WILLA	Yeah. Come here.

MAN	Like, international crisis happens.

MAN	Everyone's a little more on edge because Donald Trump is president.

MAN	And fair enough.

MAN	And fair enough (indistinct)

MAN	but I always try…

MATT	Dude, are you wearing a bandana?

OWEN	Sure am!

OWEN	I got a membership at Gold's, did a couple of circuits before I got here.

OWEN	Come on in.

MATT	Wait, you're eating already?

MATT	I thought we're getting lunch.

OWEN	Bro, I waited an hour and a half yesterday for this bad boy.

OWEN	I don't want it to go to waste, you know.

MATT	Oh, you lost a couple of penos there.

OWEN	Pass me the wrench, right in your side compartment right there.

OWEN	Besides, who do I have to be skinny for?  You know what I mean?

OWEN	Let's talk about the facts, okay?

OWEN	The little one would never let me keep my sauces in the car.

OWEN	But now I have them for easy access whenever I want.

MATT	Look, I-I love you and-and I know you and Hallie just broke up.

MATT	But this is not good, all right?

MATT	You're gonna fall into a hole.

MATT	You said you wanted freedom.  You should really use it right.

OWEN	All right.  You're doing a whole lot of talking about me.

OWEN	What about Willa?  What's going on with you guys?

OWEN	You haven't talked about her the whole minute you've been in the car, I'm amazed.

MATT	It's-it's good.

MATT	It's actually yeah, it's actually really good.

MATT	She-she and I had the "How many people have you slept with?" conversation the other day

MATT	which usually fucking sucks.  But it turns out we're both at nine.

MATT	And she just turned to me in bed and said, "I love that we're each other's tens."

MATT	What? Stop.	

OWEN	Really?

MATT	What?

OWEN	Nine?

MATT	What?

OWEN	Nine?

MATT	Yes.

OWEN	Come on. Who do you think she is, 10 people total?

OWEN	Yes, like, maybe 10 people last fucking Christmas over the holiday break.

MATT	Shut the fuck up.

OWEN	Okay.  Let me tell you something, pal, all right?

OWEN	Willa's like a fucking goddess.

OWEN	She's like a sex goddess.

OWEN	The girl is like top three most beautiful women I've ever seen in real life.

MATT	Why are we still in park?

OWEN	Let me ask wait, wait.

OWEN	Let me just ask you a question first.

OWEN	Did you give the number and then she agreed with you?

OWEN	Or did she give the number first?

OWEN	You gave the number and she agreed with you.

OWEN	Breaks my heart that I'm right all the time.

MATT	It smells really weird in here.

OWEN	It's the smell of freedom, my friend.

MATT	So, I was gonna say, "What are you up to today?

MATT	I have a surprise for us.  I'll bring the vodka water.

MATT	Or is it weird if I don't acknowledge the Owen and Hallie situation?

MAGGIE	Yo, you sound straight up like a murderer when you overthink this much.

MATT	Stop.  There, can you just please write it for me?

MAGGIE	You know what, it's fine.

MATT	Oh, she's typing.

MATT	That's good, right?

MATT	Or is it bad that she hasn't waited?

MAGGIE	I don't know what the rules are anymore.

MATT	Okay, we know the typing bubble's gone now.

MAGGIE	This is your face when you cry.  (cries)

MATT	How do you know?

MATT	Fuck. Stop. Stop.

WILLA	So you're really not gonna tell me?

MATT	Nope, you'll see.

MATT	Here he is.

WILLA	What do you mean, here he is?  Are we doing a drug deal?

MATT	Just trust me, all right?

MATT	Come on.

WILLA	Oh, we're getting into his car? Okay.

ADAM	Hey, what's up, guys? I'm Adam.

MATT	So would you mind explaining to Willa what we're doing here because she has no idea.

ADAM	Well, Willa, we're gonna go on the OJ tour.

WILLA	What?

ADAM	The OJ Simpson Murder Tour.

MATT	It's vodka-water.

MATT	Do it.

ADAM	All right.

ADAM	We're gonna just jump straight into the tour here.

ADAM	Across the street is Paul Revere Middle School.

ADAM	Now this is where OJ Simpson and Nicole's daughter had a dance recital

ADAM	on the night of June 12th, 1994.

ADAM	You remember from the court case, OJ was found not guilty of the murders.

ADAM	For the purposes of our tour, we're just gonna say that he did it (indistinct)

STYLIST	no, where the fuck is my assistant?

STYLIST	Hallie?

STYLIST	Oh, Dexter's girlfriend quit.

STYLIST	Who wears a size zero around here?

WOMAN	Hallie does.

STYLIST	Get her in a dress.

SINGER	Rolling thunder…

STYLIST	Dexter.

SINGER	…like a summer evening timpani.

STYLIST	This is Hallie, my assistant.

STYLIST	She's replacing your girlfriend.

HALLIE	Hi. Oh.

SINGER	Raindrops hit my bedroom window.

DEXTER	Nice to meet you.  Dexter.

HALLIE	I know.

DEXTER	Shall we?

HALLIE	Yeah!

DEXTER	Yeah. Okay.

SINGER	I have seen the future.

HALLIE	But I honestly preferred it to season one, actually.

HALLIE	What about the scenes you do in space like how do you how do you shoot that?

HALLIE	I mean, obviously, you're not in space, duh.

HALLIE	But do they have you like flying up in the air or something or…

DEXTER	You know what, this may be a little forward, but do you have a boyfriend?

HALLIE	Don't you have a girlfriend?

HALLIE	We're, uh, we're kind of in a rough patch if I'm being honest.

DEXTER	How do you mean?

HALLIE	I mean, I love Owen.

HALLIE	His name's Owen and-and I love him.

HALLIE	I just I don't know, things are so weird right now.

HALLIE	We might be moving in together though, which I think-I think could help.

HALLIE	I think we just need some-some newness, you know?

PRODUCTION ASSISTANT	Hey, guys, they're ready for you.

SINGERS	I was born to tell a lie.

STYLIST	Okay. Act like you have a secret.	

SINGERS	I could never change your mind..

STYLIST	No. Like-like you have a secret.

SINGERS	There was nothing I could do, nothing I could do.

STYLIST	Yes.

HALLIE	She needs to take a break.

DEXTER	She maybe

STYLIST	Yes.

SINGERS	I was born to tell a lie.

SINGERS	I could never change your mind

SINGERS	Even though I told the truth.

SINGERS	There was nothing I could do, nothing I could do.

SINGERS	Now the poison's on my tongue.

SINGERS	There's no battles to be won.

SINGERS	You were always on my mind.

SINGERS	Chasing all the summertime.

WOMAN	Hi.

OWEN	I'm Owen.

WOMAN	I'm just waiting for my boyfriend.

OWEN	Okay.

DEXTER	That's phenomenal, cheers.

HALLIE	Thank you.

DEXTER	Uh-hmm.

HALLIE	I mean, it's just one photo and it is a big group show

HALLIE	but who knows, maybe it'll sell.  (laughs)

DEXTER	I'm actually a bit of an amateur photographer myself.

HALLIE	Oh, what, like your Instagram?  (laughs)

DEXTER	Yeah.

DEXTER	It's crazy, like with all the fans of the show.

HALLIE	No, I was kidding.

DEXTER	Okay.

DEXTER	I can take a picture of anything I see, right?

HALLIE	Uh-hmm.

DEXTER	And as soon as I post it like hundred likes…

DEXTER	…five hundred likes, a thousand, guys like everything.

HALLIE	Um, can I click refresh?

DEXTER	Yeah, do it.

DEXTER	Yeah.

DEXTER	Crazy.

OWEN	Holy shit, it's this guy.

DEXTER	Hey, look, don't worry about it.  I deal with this kind of thing all the time.

DEXTER	He probably wants a picture or something.  Just let me do the talking.

DEXTER	What's up, man?

OWEN	Wow, okay.

OWEN	You know, she made me watch your stupid little show and I actually liked it.

OWEN	I didn't want to, but I did, but not anymore.

OWEN	You just lost a viewer in me, buddy boy, okay?

OWEN	I will no longer be using Hallie's mother's HBO Go password.

OWEN	Good luck with Season Four.

DEXTER	That the boyfriend you mentioned?

HALLIE	Oh, yeah.

OWEN	Sorry, man, can I can I give you a dollar for a cigarette?

MAN	You can just have one then.

OWEN	Oh, thanks.

OWEN	I'm sorry, can-can I get a lighter too?

OWEN	Can't believe she brought him here, our fucking spot.

MAN	Excuse me?

OWEN	Hmm?

MATT	Now we're on this whole true crime kick.

MATT	Did you know the movie theater I work at is like fully haunted?

WILLA	Wait. What?

MATT	Uh-hmm.

MATT	In the '90s, the owner was murdered by a hit man who was hired by the projectionist, his lover?

MATT	Because he thought he was in the will.

WILLA	Unreal.

MATT	Uh-hmm.

WILLA	How do people still think that they can be the beneficiary of a murder victim's shit,

WILLA	have them killed, and that they won't be busted by the cops within one second?

MATT	I know, right?

WILLA	Wait.  Who is it?

MATT	Uh, Hallie.

MATT	She says, "Almost back with the actor.

MATT	Sorry for the short notice."

WILLA	Um, can you respond, "All good"?

MATT	Sure.  What's your passcode?

WILLA	One, two, three, four.

MATT	Wow, crack security system you got there.

WILLA	I have nothing to hide.

MATT	Also, so should we leave?

CLARA	Oh! I didn't realize you guys were here!

WILLA	Hi.

MATT	Oh, looks like we got a full house over here.  (laughs)

HALLIE	Oh, hi. Hi, guys. (laughs)

WILLA	Hey, we're just about to bounce.

HALLIE	Are you doing Cat Cow?

DEXTER	Just one sec, I'm almost there.

DEXTER	Oh, yeah.

HALLIE	Okay.

DEXTER	Are you ready?

HALLIE	Oh, yeah.

CLARA	I was just very intimately associated with whatever's happening there.

MATT	Oh, let's just go to mine.

DEXTER	Oh, man, I wish I could stay the night.

HALLIE	Bye.

CLARA	Hi.

HALLIE	Hi.

HALLIE	I'm sorry.  Were we-were we too loud?

CLARA	No.  No, you're all I mean, yeah, but no.

CLARA	Um, you actually have a second to talk?

HALLIE	Yeah, sure, what's-what's going on?

CLARA	Um, okay. I know this is so weird and out of the blue but, um,

CLARA	Thad asked me to move in with him.

HALLIE	Australia Thad?

CLARA	Yeah.  He's, like, moving here to be with me.

HALLIE	Oh, my God, Clara, congrats.

CLARA	It's so annoying, isn't it?  I'm the worst?

HALLIE	Oh, my God, no.  No, I'm-I'm-I'm happy for you. I…

CLARA	I heard you shebang-ing.

MAN	Hand me that little box in the compartment, will you, pal?

WILLA	Sorry.

MAN	Hold the wheel, will you?

MAN	How far are you going?

WILLA	I think it's cute you made me a mix tape.

WILLA	It's like we're in eighth grade.

MATT	Are you making fun of me?

WILLA	Yeah.

MATT	Oh, I put that DJ Diaz song on here.

WILLA	Hmm?

MATT	For our first night.

WILLA	Oh, our dry-humping song.

MATT	Yeah.  Well, they're actually playing pretty soon.

WILLA	I could be down.

MATT	Dope. Okay.  Well, I-I should head out. I have to be…

WILLA	No! I got some stuff to do.

WILLA	No, you don't.

WILLA	Wait, no.  This is not gonna work.

MATT	You're breaking up with me?

WILLA	Shut up. Sink sex.	

WILLA	Oh, no. This is not gonna work either

MATT	Nothing's good enough for you.

SINGER	Under the covers

SINGER	I gave myself to you…

WILLA	Clara left some crystals.

MATT	Wait, so your old landlord shipped over all this stuff.

MATT	He must've really liked you.

WILLA	Yeah. He had a crush on me, so he kept them for a while.

MATT	Yo, what's up?

OWEN	What up, biatch?

OWEN	You stick your finger in Willa's butt last night or what?

MATT	I'm sorry.  Yo, dude, come on.

OWEN	Bro, do you believe this shit?

MATT	Do I believe what shit?

OWEN	Is Hallie fucking Persky?

OWEN	She is, isn't she?  Son of a fucking bitch.

OWEN	Honestly, I could tell at the 4th of July party, that guy has been trying to fuck her for so long.

OWEN	Holy shit. First, that stupid ass from the spacecraft show and now this fool?

MATT	Yo, what are you talking about?

OWEN	Bro, I can see it on their Instagrams.  They're commenting back and forth like dumb shit.

OWEN	Like, "Dope sunset."

MATT	Dude, why are you so charged up? 

OWEN	Honestly, his name should be a verb, to Persky.

OWEN	Sample sentence, "Hey, I just heard they broke up, so I'm gonna go Persky the shit out of her!"

MATT	Yo, you need to relax, bro.

OWEN	Relax?

OWEN	I feel like I'm gonna fucking stroke out.

OWEN	I feel like Liotta at the end of Goodfellas.

OWEN	I'm seeing fucking helicopters.

MATT	All right. I'm sorry. Look, I-I'm with Willa right now, so I can't really talk.

OWEN	Okay.  Whatever Hallie is up to, it's fine.

OWEN	I'm on a record breaking fuck streak of my own right now.

OWEN	So listen, mysterious and busy, my man, you feel me?

OWEN	Or she'll break your little heart in half.

HALLIE	Oh, thank God you guys are here.  This is so embarrassing.

HALLIE	Nobody is here.

WILLA	Hal, what are you talking about?  There are totally people here.

MATT	Yeah.

HALLIE	Yeah, but nobody that I invited.

HALLIE	I mean, it's literally you guys and my boss that showed up for me.

WILLA	Fuck everyone else.

HALLIE	Brandon Saknov texted me being like, "Daddy can't find his keys."

HALLIE	And then, fucking Shareen texted me being like, "Baby Girl, I'm stuck with this guy.

HALLIE	Love you. I would literally do anything to be there."  It's like, "Really? Would you?"

HALLIE	I mean, my next show is just gonna be screen grabs of those text messages called

HALLIE	Reasons Why My Friends Bailed on My Opening.

MATT	We'll come to that one.

WILLA	Yup.

MIA	Hallie, I want you to meet Lindsay.

HALLIE	Hi.

MIA	Lindsay lives in the house we shot Dexter in.

MATT	Stop.

MIA	And Lindsay, this is Hallie, my assistant.

HALLIE	That house is beautiful.  Thank you so much for letting us use it.

LINDSAY	Uh, I wish it was mine, I'm just housesitting for my godmother.

LINDSAY	I didn't even tell her you guys used it.

MIA	So Lindsay, this is Hallie's photograph.  It's the best one here as far as I'm concerned.

HALLIE	Oh, my God.  Thank you so much for saying that.

HALLIE	I just wish my love life was going as well as my work life.

HALLIE	I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

HALLIE	I think I've just had way too much wine.

LINDSAY	No. No.  There's no such thing as too much wine.

LINDSAY	In fact, maybe we should get you some more.

HALLIE	Yes. Please.

OWEN	Her ring.

OWEN	Fucking kidding me.

LINDSAY	Let's go swimming.

LINDSAY	Come on.

LINDSAY	Ready?

MATT	I'm stoked.

WILLA	What?  Seriously.

MATT	Wait, my pants.

EUGENE	Oh, sorry. I'll-I'll go in the back.

MATT	It's all right.

EUGENE	Two of you, one of me.

EUGENE	I-I think he's dropping you off first anyways.

MATT	All right.

EUGENE	I'm Eugene, by the way.

WILLA	Willa.

EUGENE	Hi, pleasure.

WILLA	Um, can we maybe not tell Owen about what just happened?

MATT	Oh, yeah. He'd totally lose his shit.	

WILLA	Yeah.

EUGENE	Who's Owen?

OWEN	I can't wait to be neighbors.

MAGGIE	Uh-hmm.

OWEN	I'm just gonna be the guy in the backyard blasting Dashboard Confessional.

MAGGIE	You are never living that down.

OWEN	No.

MAGGIE	You're a fucking plagiarizer.

OWEN	Well, you have to admit, I was at least convincing at it.

OWEN	I would, you know, cross stuff out, so it would seem like I'd make mistakes as it went on.

MAGGIE	Buddy, they-they reminded me of the Zodiac letters.

MAGGIE	I mean, I knew the whole time. I've-I've-but I've told you this. It-it was sweet.

OWEN	You-you're comparing me to the Zodiac Killer, but you're letting me live in your backhouse.

OWEN	Very mixed signals.

MAGGIE	So that's you, that backhouse right there.

ASH	Hey, babe.

MAGGIE	Hey, babe.

MAGGIE	Here's your coffee.

ASH	Nice, thank you.

MAGGIE	Uh-hmm.

ASH	Oh, hey, man. Ash.

OWEN	Hey. Owen.

MAGGIE	Oh, yeah.  Oh, this is-this is our new tenant.

MAGGIE	Oh, my God.

ASH	Oh yeah. Right.

ASH	Nice to meet you, brother.

OWEN	Nice to meet you.

ASH	You got a good one.

MAGGIE	Yeah.

WILLA	Morning, sunshine.

MATT	Yeah. Good morning.

WILLA	I can't believe you grew up in this fuck palace.

MATT	Yeah.

WILLA	So what's the deal with your parents?

MATT	Uh, they-they do visual effects together.

MATT	My mom's a-a VFX producer and my dad's a VFX supervisor.

WILLA	They worked together?  That's cute.

MATT	(laughs) Yeah.  They're, like, perfect. (laughs)

MATT	Um, and they're doing this new Marvel movie in Atlanta.

WILLA	Well, when are they back?  I really wanna meet them.

WILLA	Wait. Have you ever introduced them to a girl before?

MATT	What? No. I-no,

MATT	I-I just thought maybe-maybe it's like a-a little soon, but-but no.

MATT	If-if-and if-if you wanna meet them, then-then I'd love that.

MATT	I mean, yeah, they're back in like a month.

WILLA	Oh, perfect. Just in time for the wedding.	

MATT	Yeah, I've never introduced them to a girlfriend before.

MATT	Oh, I'm sorry. Did-oh, did I just ruin it? I…

WILLA	No.

MATT	I know we haven't had that conversation yet.

WILLA	No, no, no.  It's all good.

MATT	Oh. How could I forget?

MATT	This is for you.

WILLA	A mix CD.

WILLA	Um, you already gave me one.  Do you remember? Are you okay?

MATT	No. This-this is an extension of that one.

MATT	Yeah, I made a playlist of, like, 40 something songs and this is everything I couldn't fit

MATT	onto the first one because you can only do, like, 20 or 21 on a CD.

WILLA	Big Willa Style, mix number two.

WILLA	This time it's personal.

MATT	Personal.

MATT	Yeah.

WILLA	Whoa.

MATT	So, uh, you wanna get some breakfast?

WILLA	Um, I'm actually not hungry.

MATT	Oh, okay. Well, I mean,

MATT	we could do like a do a bagel run, we could get, like, a dozen or something bagels.

WILLA	That's a lot of bagels.  Oh, shit.

WILLA	I just remembered my laundry.

MATT	Oh, word.

MATT	We can-uh, we can go grab it.

WILLA	No, it'll get moldy and wrinkly.  Um, I'm just gonna run and grab it.

WILLA	I-I will call you later.

MATT	Oh, cool. Yeah, I-I gotta go help Owen move in, so that's perfect.

MATT	Fuck.

WILLA	Hallie, wanna get some food?

WILLA	I am fucking starving.  Also, apparently, Owen has a new place.

HALLIE	Clara's here just come home.

CLARA	Hi, Willa!

CLARA	Okay.  Are you guys ready?

HALLIE	I can't believe we're gonna hear a song that you actually wrote.

CLARA	Sweet Virginia

CLARA	has to wait.

CLARA	Got a lovesick heart on fire.

CLARA	Got a lovesick heart on fire.

CLARA	All her friends know she's on a wire.

CLARA	Sweet

CLARA	sweet.

CLARA	Makes her say the strangest things.

CLARA	She told Marie that she was in love.

CLARA	Fell into the arms of Hadra's smile.

CLARA	At the break of a cracking dawn.

CLARA	On the Westside High.

CLARA	So

CLARA	Virginia stays at home.

CLARA	Doing all the simple household things.

CLARA	Picking up the phone and letting it ring.

CLARA	And she plays in lover's eye.

CLARA	Sweet.

CLARA	So nice being back here.

CLARA	Honestly, Thad won't even let me smoke in the house.

CLARA	It's really annoying.

CLARA	Thank you so much.

HALLIE	Willa, what are you doing?

HALLIE	Are you texting Jakob?

HALLIE	I thought you said you were done with him.

WILLA	Leave me alone, let me live.

HALLIE	Forget about Jakob, okay?  He's a dick.

HALLIE	And he spells his name like Jacob.

CLARA	That is true.

HALLIE	Just make it work with Matt.

HALLIE	I mean, I know he's weird, but he's a good guy and you're being stupid, okay?

HALLIE	I mean, you have someone that wants to spend time with you, okay?

HALLIE	I am I'm alone, like I am-I'm so fucking alone

HALLIE	and to be honest, I just cannot hear you go on and on

HALLIE	and on any more about how, "Matt text me too much,

HALLIE	Matt just wants to eat bagels with me."

HALLIE	Like, I'm too fragile right now, okay?

HALLIE	Owen never wanted to just eat bagels with me.  (sighs)

WILLA	Favorite selfie face.

MATT	The classic, the pout.

WILLA	The classic pout from this angle.

MATT	Who's this dude?

MATT	I don't trust this guy.

WILLA	Okay.

MATT	These ones are super cute.

WILLA	Can I plug my phone in?

MATT	Uh, yeah, sure.

MATT	Ooh, actually, I have an idea.

MATT	Okay.  Um, okay.

MATT	Can I do a magic trick for you?

MATT	Are you gonna think I'm weird?

WILLA	Okay.

MATT	Okay.

MATT	Wait, was that a yes, so you're just gonna think I'm weird?

WILLA	Yes.

MATT	Here. Let me I got to get warmed up, let me see.

MATT	Okay. Pick a card, don't show me though.

MATT	I'm, like, actually really nervous.

MATT	Yeah, you got it.

WILLA	Okay.

MATT	Okay. Let's hope my powers are on point today because sometimes I'm a little off.

MATT	Put it back right there.

MATT	Okay. Take a look at it.

WILLA	Uh-hmm.

MATT	Don't' show me.

WILLA	No.

MATT	Okay. You remember it?

WILLA	I remember.

MATT	Because if you forget it, it does kind of make the magic not as good.

WILLA	Okay.

MATT	All right. Do you want me to shuffle?

WILLA	Uh-hmm.

MATT	Yeah, wow you are very suspicious.

MATT	Oh, my God, I thought you were more trusting of me, I see.

MATT	Okay.

MATT	Here we go.  I'm gonna try and find your card out of all these.

WILLA	Uh-hmm.

MATT	But I'm gonna try and find it using my mouth, okay?

MATT	And double check, there's nothing in my mouth?

MATT	Okay.

WILLA	Okay.

MATT	Here we go. Well, there is. There's teeth and a tongue

MATT	but if you miss that then you'll miss anything.

MATT	Okay.

MATT	Uh-hmm, uh-hmm.

WILLA	No, that's not my card.

MATT	What?

WILLA	That's not my card.

MATT	Oh, my God. What?

WILLA	Are you okay?

MATT	I'm so sorry.  This has never happened to me before.

WILLA	Oh, my God, wait what?

MATT	Oh, my God. I feel so ill.

WILLA	What the fuck.

MATT	Wait.  Oh, my eyes are watering.

MATT	Is that it?

WILLA	Wait. What the fuck.

WILLA	How did you do that?

WILLA	You're such a nerd.

MATT	Thank you.  I actually take that as a compliment.

WILLA	Uh-hmm.  Oh, my God.

MATT	Hey. Is there no clasp?

WILLA	Just untie it.

MATT	Did you go to the beach today?

WILLA	No.

MATT	Then why are you wearing your bathing suit?

WILLA	Because I didn't have any clean bras.

MATT	But I-I thought you just did your laundry.

MATT	Isn't that why you left the other day, to get your laundry?

MATT	Why don't you just tell me stuff?

WILLA	I'm sorry.

MATT	Just-just tell me, okay?

MATT	That I don't wanna hang out or whatever.

MATT	I-I don't wanna hang out with you sometimes, you know.

WILLA	That's not true.  You always wanna hang out with me.

WILLA	Hey.

MATT	Stop.

WILLA	Next time, I'll tell you I don't wanna see your face anymore.

WILLA	I'll say, "Hey, go fuck yourself.

WILLA	You're bothering me and you're being an idiot."

MATT	Good. All right?  That's what I wanna hear.

WILLA	Okay.  Stop acting like a pussy right now.

OWEN	Hup.

OWEN	I got it.

MAGGIE	Oh, thanks.

OWEN	Sure.

MAGGIE	Um, what are you doing tonight?

MAGGIE	I think Ash has got a work drinks thing.

MAGGIE	He's freaking out about fatherhood or something.

MAGGIE	This is when he sneaks off to have a glass of Chardonnay which I know means

MAGGIE	slam back three martinis in ten minutes.

OWEN	Hey, I thought you guys are great?

MAGGIE	Ah, it's not as good as it looks.

OWEN	Are you sure?

MAGGIE	Yeah, yeah, yeah.

HALLIE	Who was that?

OWEN	Just an old friend, new landlord.

HALLIE	So what, you're like you're, like, jogging now?

OWEN	Yeah.

HALLIE	Sorry, I'll be ready in a sec.

WILLA	I can't believe you guys hooked up.

HALLIE	Stop.  How's  how's everything with Matt?

WILLA	Honestly, I don't know.

HALLIE	What do you mean you don't know?

HALLIE	Come on, I'm meeting Lindsay at 6:00.

WILLA	Aw, my little lesbian.

SINGER	You've gone too far now,

SINGER	Let it all disintegrate.

SINGER	I could see he loves it.

MATT	Oh, dude, you gotta stop liking you and Hallie's Facebook photos.

MATT	You know when you do that it shows up on everybody's feed, right?

OWEN	You know she came here today?

OWEN	Showed up completely randomly out of nowhere.

OWEN	What is that  what is that move?  It's a power move.

MATT	Yeah. I, uh, I might have given Willa the address.

OWEN	It was you?

MATT	Yeah, I'm sorry.

MATT	She  she asked and I was…

OWEN	And you gave it to her?  Whose side are you on?

MATT	I'm sorry, man, she gets what she wants…

OWEN	You can't do that. You can't give out a man's address like that.

MATT	You know, I feel like Willa and I are kind of hittinga wall.

OWEN	Fuck romantic fulfillment.  I'm seriously busy, man.

OWEN	I've just  I've told you over and over and over, mysterious and busy.

OWEN	It should be your mantra.  You're way too available.

MATT	I know but…

OWEN	For once in your life, don't be.

MATT	No, it's just called being nice.

OWEN	It's not being nice, it's being available.

OWEN	Being nice is like opening doors for people

OWEN	and  and  and showing up to places on time.

OWEN	Being too available is when you see the little text bubble show up

OWEN	the  the second after you finish writing the text.

OWEN	Like, you can't do that.

MATT	I know.

OWEN	Mysterious and busy, real life example.

OWEN	Today, I go on a nice run,

OWEN	I come back Hallie's waiting for me,

OWEN	wearing my favorite dress and I'm, like, "Hello.

OWEN	We start making out, we come in here and I eat her pussy

OWEN	exactly where you're sitting.

MATT	Oh, lovely. Thank you.

OWEN	And that was it.

OWEN	That was the entire interaction because I'm mysterious and busy.

OWEN	You mind of giving me another pour?

MATT	Sure, bro. Yes.

OWEN	Nope, you failed the test. Mysterious and busy test, you failed it.

OWEN	You failed it. I literally put it right here

OWEN	so I have access to it so I can just reach and pour.

OWEN	Would you like some?

MATT	No. I'm fine, thank you.

MATT	I'm busy.

OWEN	Good. That was test number two.

OWEN	That one you passed.

MATT	Dude, you're the fucking worst.

WILLA	Hey.

MATT	Hey.

MATT	So should we just go to the show or…

WILLA	I don't know.  I thought we'd hang out for a sec.

MATT	You know, I think DJDS goes on at 9:00 so…

WILLA	Oh, yeah, I don't wanna be late for the show.

MATT	Right, I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.  I'm sure they'll start late.

WILLA	Oh, you're serious.

WILLA	I was literally just trying to fuck you.

OWEN	What's going on?

OWEN	Well, hey.

MATT	Hey.

WILLA	Are you guys…

HALLIE	We're catching up.

MATT	Cool, cool, got it.

HALLIE	Why do you always reek of deli meat?

OWEN	See what I'm dealing with here?

WILLA	I can't believe you bought a shirt.

MATT	Yeah, it's pretty dope.

MATT	Is it weird if I get a Caesar salad?

WILLA	Yeah.

WILLA	Oh, my God.

JAKOB	Holy shit, girl.

JAKOB	Come here. Oh, my God, Oh, my god, we gotta get that drink.

WILLA	Yeah, I mean, no worries, I've been busy.  So good to see you.

JAKOB	Yeah.

JAKOB	Hey man, Jakob.

MATT	Hey, I'm Matt.

JAKOB	Nice to meet you, man.

MATT	Nice to meet you.

JAKOB	Nice merge.

MATT	Thanks.

JAKOB	Well, I'm gonna head out, I was just here to see the opener, you know.

JAKOB	Good to meet you.  Good to see you.

WILLA	Nice to see you.

MATT	Nice to meet you.

MATT	You want a drink?

SINGER	Trees on fire, flame went higher.

SINGER	And I don't ever want it to change.

SINGER	Trees on fire, flame went higher.

SINGER	And I don't ever want it to stay the same.

SINGER	Night on fire, new desire.

SINGER	And I don't ever want it to change.

SINGER	Trees on fire, flame went higher.

SINGER	And I don't ever want it to stay the same.

SINGER	Hard time go by, don't it.  Hard time go by, don't it.

SINGER	Hard time go by, don't it.  You see me and I know you know it.

SINGER	Hard time go by, don't it.  Hard time go by, don't it.

SINGER	Hard time go by, don't it.  You see me and I know you know.

SINGER	Flame went higher.

OWEN	Hypothetically, if we were to get back together, uh 

OWEN	it would be better because I've I've grown.	

HALLIE	Okay, well let me tell you something.  If you think you just break things off

HALLIE	between us, so you can go on like a Rumspringa or something

HALLIE	and then come back and be like, "Oh, I've grown,"

HALLIE	you are in for a rude fucking awakening, Owen.

OWEN	Hallie, that's not how I meant it!

HALLIE	And besides, I'm kind of seeing someone.

OWEN	Okay, like  what, like in a  in a real way?

HALLIE	Yeah, like in a real way.

HALLIE	This girl, so  yeah.

OWEN	You're dating a girl?

HALLIE	Uh-hmm.

OWEN	I didn't know that was of interest to you.

HALLIE	Okay.  You know you can answer the phone.

OWEN	It's fine. It's fine, it's not.

HALLIE	Something might be wrong.

OWEN	Was it going on when  when  when you came over and I went down on you?

HALLIE	Was what going on?  Yeah, it's the girl, yeah.

OWEN	I can't  I can't believe you're dating a girl and you're just telling me now.

OWEN	This is insane.

OWEN	Mom, you're fucking killing me!

HALLIE	Anyways, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and at first,

HALLIE	I was so fucking mad at you. I was.

HALLIE	I was thinking like, "How did I waste the first half of my 20s

HALLIE	with this guy who I'm not gonna marry?"

OWEN	Right.

HALLIE	But then I realized, you know, that these  these last five years

HALLIE	have been the opposite…

OWEN	Three.

OWEN	It's been three years.

HALLIE	Have been the opposite of a waste

HALLIE	and that even if we hurt each other, it's  it's fine.

HALLIE	It's all part of how we're gonna become the people we're gonna be, so.

HALLIE	I'm at peace.

OWEN	I fucked up. Okay?

OWEN	I shouldn't have said that I wanted a break.

OWEN	I was naive enough to think that it could be a break and not a break up.

HALLIE	Owen, just answer the phone.

OWEN	Yes, mother.

OWEN	I don't  I don't  I don't  I don't know.

OWEN 	I  I don't know what  what channel TCM is.

OWEN 	I can't talk, I'm  I'm with Hallie right now.

OWEN 	No, actually. I don't know.

OWEN 	I really don't know.

OWEN 	She's dating a girl.

HALLIE	Owen!

OWEN 	I know, I know, you're right.  Okay, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later.

OWEN 	Bye. I love you.

HALLIE	Do you just tell your mom I'm a lesbian?  Why would you tell your mom that?

OWEN	It's fine. I also just wanna say this non sequitur,

OWEN	but I would  I  I did slightly resent the fact that you neglected to tell me

OWEN	that you were using my likeness in your photo gallery.

HALLIE	Are you fucking serious?

OWEN	Yeah, I'm serious.

HALLIE	I mean, the photo may as well have been a picture

HALLIE	of a pile of dog shit for all you care.

OWEN	Maybe we should  maybe the problem is

OWEN	that we kept in touch and that we slept together.

HALLIE	Okay. Okay.

OWEN	Or that we're  we're  we're obviously

OWEN	going at completely different speeds.

OWEN	So, maybe let's just not talk for a while.

HALLIE	Okay. You know, I just wanna point out that I never put any pressure on you.

HALLIE	I mean, yes, I wanted to move in together out of practicality.

HALLIE	I wasn't secretly plotting a wedding.

HALLIE	That was all you projecting.

MATT	So what's that, uh, Jakob guy's deal?

WILLA	Just some guy I know from New York.

MATT	I saw your texts with him.

WILLA	What are you talking about?

MATT	I know I shouldn't have, but I looked in your phone a while back.

WILLA	Wait, you hacked into my phone?

MATT	It was a moment of weakness, I'm sorry.

WILLA	It was so long ago things with Jakob.  It was like May.

WILLA	Also, it didn't even mean anything, so who cares?

MATT	Whatever's been happening between us, whatever it's called,

MATT	it's a big deal to me, all right?  And maybe I'm crazy.

MATT	Maybe  maybe it shouldn't be, but it is.  It's a big deal to me.

WILLA	Yeah, and it's a big deal to me too.

MATT	I don't think it is, but that's fine.

MATT	Obviously you find yourself in these situations more often than I do

MATT	and you're a lot better at it than I am.

MATT	I had a thing with this girl a while back.

MATT	She went abroad and the whole time I thought that maybe I'd have another shot

MATT	when she came back.

MATT	But then I found out she dated like four other guys that year.

MATT	To me, she was the one that got away, but to her I was a  a blip.

MATT	I was just some guy she fucked.

MATT	And I'm not mad at you, you don't owe me anything, but 

MATT	I don't know. I just think maybe we  maybe we shouldn't do this anymore.

WILLA	Wait, what?

WILLA	No, what are you saying?

WILLA	Can I still sleep over?

SINGER	No one knows. No one knows.

MATT	I feel like you're a whole section of my story and I'm like a footnote in yours.

WILLA	I promise you're not a footnote.

WILLA	I promise you're at least a chapter.

SINGER	No one knows. No one knows.

OWEN	I'm so happy that you were the one to break it up with Willa

OWEN	and not the other way around.

OWEN	I thought she could've fucking prison shanked you

OWEN	and you would have stayed with her.

MATT	Honestly, I  I just wish we were better at communicating, you know?

MATT	It's like you can never be inside someone else's head

MATT	and I guess you wouldn't wanna be but…

OWEN	No, not unless you're a fucking tarot card reader.

OWEN	I mean, she's gotta communicate with you too, you know?

MATT	Here's what it is. She's like  she's like a cat who keeps asking you

MATT	to pet it and then you do, and she just slips out of your hands and runs away.

OWEN	I think you gotta work on your analogies, sweetheart.

OWEN	Oops.

MATT	Shit!

MATT	Go un  go under.

OWEN	No, no, no, no, don't go any further.

OWEN	Wait, easy there. Cheers.

HALLIE	I get it, Matt's too nice for you.

WILLA	I mean, it's not the cliché of "I like assholes".

WILLA	I like nice guys. It's just that the nice guys turn out to be pretty needy.

WILLA	And then you realize, "Oh, he's being a pussy."

WILLA	I think I'm just being an asshole.

HALLIE	You lost me.

MATT	When would we get a chance to do this if you 

MATT	if you were with Hallie and I was with Willa?

OWEN	Yeah, I'm glad we broke up with our fucking beautiful significant others

OWEN	so we can hang out with each other and strap Tecates

OWEN	to our hands and in your kitchen.

MATT	I'm having the time of my life!

OWEN	That's what's sad. You really are having the time of your life.

OWEN	Honestly, I can't believe Hallie's dating a girl.

MATT	I don't know, I think they were just hooking up.

OWEN	What, really?

MATT	Yeah.

OWEN	She just told me they were dating.

OWEN	Like she just  when I just saw her, she was like, "We're dating.

OWEN	You should know."  And I was like, well…

MATT	Really?

OWEN	"I'm dating her."

OWEN	Is  is  is she, like, trying to fuck with me?

OWEN	What is she doing?

MATT	To be fair, you  you  you broke up with her.

OWEN	You're right. You're right.

WILLA	Jesus, am I the needy one in the Jakob situation? Am I his Matt?

HALLIE	Enough Jakob.

HALLIE	You only like him because he didn't text you back.

WILLA	I mean, technically I moved out here to go to gradschool.

WILLA	Obviously in the back of my mind, part of it was that Jakob would be out here.

HALLIE	Hmm.

WILLA	Am I felicity?

HALLIE	Willa, we're all felicity.

HALLIE	Look, fuck Jakob, okay?

HALLIE	I've said it before, but Jakob's a dick and that is my philosophy.

WILLA	Your philosophy is that Jakob's a dick.

HALLIE	No, my philosophy is that if someone is not being nice to you,

HALLIE	then you fucking drop them. Poof!

OWEN	I don't wanna get back together and then just spend

OWEN	the rest of the time resenting each other all over again, you know?

MATT	I don't  I don't think you ever find someone you don't resent

MATT	and that's part of it. It's just…

MATT	find the person that you want to resent, you know?

HALLIE 	Hey, Matt.

MATT	I don't know, I think you're overthinking it.

MATT	It's easy to forget how hard it can be just to connect with someone.

HALLIE	Yeah.

MATT	It's like when you pass a parking space

MATT	because you want one close to the restaurant and then you circle the block

MATT	and you come back and it's gone.

HALLIE	Okay.

MATT	Honestly, really, in a lifetime, how many people do you truly connect with?

HALLIE	Matt, Owen is not a parking space.

MATT	Just  can you go talk to him, please?

HALLIE	Wanna go for a swim?

MATT	No!

WILLA	Hi.

OWEN	Yo.

HALLIE 	I'm outside, you don't have a bell.

OWEN	Yeah, I'll be right there.

OWEN	You, uh, you  you want something, you want adrink?

HALLIE	Uh, like  like, what? Like  like tap water or something?

OWEN	Well, I actually went shopping and I have, um, San Pellegrino?

HALLIE	San Pellegrino? What are you, like a  like a gondolier now?

OWEN	Please.

OWEN	Shall I have a sip?  I  I forgot that that's my last one.

OWEN	That's good.

OWEN	So I, um, I'm just basically I just wanted to say again

OWEN	that I'm  I'm sorry for being so selfish

OWEN	and, um, I  I feel like everybody

OWEN	creates their own narrative in their head.

OWEN	And for whatever reason I felt like I was somebody who needed to explore things

OWEN	and the more lonely got, the more I realized that was something

OWEN	I didn't actually feel but convinced myself that I needed to feel it,

OWEN	and maybe that's the same thing.

OWEN	I don't even know the difference anymore. And I just…

HALLIE	Owen, I didn't come here for some big apology.

HALLIE	I just came here to talk.

OWEN	Will you move in with me?

HALLIE	Sorry, what?  What, move in with you where? Here?

HALLIE	Why don't we, for once, let the fact that something is a bad idea

HALLIE	stop us from doing it.

OWEN	No, it doesn't have to be here.

OWEN	It could be  it could anywhere.  We can get our own place together.

HALLIE	You're kidding.

OWEN	This is just transitional.

OWEN	Look, look, I know  I know I ruined everything. I know that.

OWEN	I know I'm an asshole, I know that I'm an idiot.

OWEN	I'm really, really ready now.

OWEN	I'm  I'm truly, like, I  I'm ready, I promise, I swear…

HALLIE	Well, I thought you said this place is just transitional?

OWEN	Look, I  I cleaned out half my closet for you. I cleaned out the bathroom floor…

HALLIE	You  you moved your four shirts like over on a  on a fucking rail.

OWEN	Well, for some people, that's significant.

OWEN	I cleaned the bathroom, I bought flowers and I put them in this vase

OWEN	and I Swiffer'd the fucking floor for you and…

OWEN	I've never made a copy of a key in my entire life,

OWEN	and I made a copy of a key for you, so please, Hallie.

OWEN	Please, will you move in with me?

HALLIE	No.

HALLIE	I'm sorry, I just  I don't think we could ever go back.

OWEN	You're seriously not gonna say anything about the new couch?

HALLIE	Yeah, it was the first thing I noticed.

OWEN	I know it was the first thing you noticed and you didn't fucking say anything,

OWEN	you're so annoying.

OWEN	You're so fucking annoying.

HALLIE	This is awesome. This is outdoor furniture, this is not a couch.

OWEN	It's a day bed, it's a fucking…

HALLIE	It's a day bed?

OWEN	Is it not a couch?

HALLIE	Hey…

OWEN	Is it not something you sit on?

OWEN	Doesn't that make it a couch?

OWEN	Oh, fucking rough, man.

HALLIE	Oh, God.

OWEN	I hate you.

HALLIE	I hate you too.

MATT	Hi!

HALLIE	Hey.

WILLA	Hey.

OWEN	What's up? Come on in.

OWEN	I'm so glad you guys could come.

HALLIE	Yeah, we were just at some lame party when you texted us, so here we are.

MATT	Hey, I'm Matt.

WILLA	Willa.

MATT	Awesome. Nice to meet you.

WILLA	Nice to meet you.

OWEN	Born and raised?

HALLIE	Born and raised, oh, my God.

OWEN	Yeah, that's  I mean, that's why I came here because I just wanted a bit of the 

OWEN	you know, a change of sceneries.

HALLIE	Yeah, yeah.

OWEN	Um, I wanted to get  just kind of see  get out

OWEN	and everywhere, I think.

OWEN	So how was the party (indistinct)

WILLA	Um, it was good.

HALLIE	Sure.
