GUEST MAN 1	And what a stupendous wedding.

GUEST MAN 2	There she is. Over here...all back to him now.

UMA	If you'll excuse me a moment.

SON'S ASSISTANT	Mr. Hingston is expecting you upstairs. A husband shouldn't be kept waiting any longer.

GUEST MAN	Your daughter is the epitome of Upper perfection.


GUEST WOMAN 1	She's earned the life ahead of her.

GUEST WOMAN 2	You must be so very proud.

ELOISE	Indeed.

SON	That place works miracles. You could be so difficult before. But now...it's as if that girl never existed.




UMA	What? Hello?

DUCHESS	Good morning, Uma. I didn't mean to startle you.

DUCHESS	Breakfast is on its way.

UMA	Breakfast? Wait, where am I?

DUCHESS	You're in paradise, of course.

ASSISTANT 2	Uma! Uma! Uma!

ASSISTANT 1	Uma!

ASSISTANT 2	Uma! Uma!

AMARNA	New in town?

UMA	Look, I need help, okay? They're chasing me and I need somewhere to hide.

UMA	I don't even know how I got here.

ASSISTANT 2	Uma!

AMARNA	Come with me. Just come with me.

UMA	What is this place?

AMARNA	You lost something?

UMA	What are you doing? No, no, no. Why won't you answer me? What is this place?

JUMP ROPE GIRLS	(SINGING) She asked her mother for 50 cents To see an elephant jump over the fence She asked her mother for 50 cents To see an elephant jump over the fence They jumped so high They reached the sky They never came back Till the 4th of July They jumped so high They reached the sky They never came back Till the 4th of July Higher, higher, higher, higher

UMA	Excuse me, but who are you?

DUCHESS	Some people complain that rosebushes have thorns. I rejoice... that thorn bushes have roses.

UMA	What I am doing here?

DUCHESS	Honey, you have no reason to be afraid. This is a center for emotional healing. Holistic and sustained healing. Now, most of our girls aren't quite so feisty when they arrive... but I do understand how difficult this must be for you.

UMA	Why can't I leave?

DUCHESS	Addressing your anger issues is gonna take a while. Sweetheart, they told me you lost control again last night.

UMA	You can tell my mother that she is wasting her time.

DUCHESS	This is an opportunity, Uma. Relax. Thank you. Observe your life from a new perspective.

UMA	And whose perspective is that? Yours? And what about mine?

DUCHESS	You'll be with us for two months. All I ask in that time is you keep an open mind...and reconsider your marriage proposal after your stay.

ASSISTANT 1	Luggage was arranged by your mother, mademoiselle.

UMA	Do you all talk like that?

CHLOE	Hey! Well, it's about time, darlin'. Hi. Rough trip?

UMA	Actually, I don't remember any of it.

CHLOE	Well, lucky you...'cause that seaplane was sketchier than a broke-ass roller coaster.

UMA	Seaplane?

CHLOE	Yeah. I'm Chloe.

UMA	Uma.

CHLOE	That's Yu. I don't reckon she's too keen on being here.

UMA	What, and you are?

CHLOE	Well, if it'll get my parents off my back.

UMA	What's their problem?

CHLOE	They think two months here is gonna...turn me into some skinny pageant queen like my sisters. It won't, 'cause I'm fine just the way I am. But, hey, I'll take a free vacation. Yu! Yu!

YU	What?

CHLOE	Meet Uma.

UMA	Hi.

YU	They told me no roommates.


CHLOE	Well, hey, that's not our fault, girl.

YU	And don't touch my stuff!

DUCHESS	Let's dress for dinner, ladies.

CHLOE	Okay.

UMA	Where's the rest of it?

WAITER ASSISTANT	Our diet is individually calibrated...for your optimum physical health and your mental equilibrium.

YU	I can't...because I'm lactose intolerant.

WAITER ASSISTANT	Allergies and intolerances have been dutifully accounted for... and, mademoiselle, dairy is not one of yours.

YU	Okay, fine, whatever.

WAITER ASSISTANT	We kindly ask you to finish all of your dinner... to have sufficient nourishment for tomorrow's activities. Bon appétit, mesdemoiselles.

CHLOE	You know her?

UMA	No. She screwed me over as soon as I got here. What? Who is she?

CHLOE	Seriously? (SINGING) If you had my heart I wouldn't want it back I'd let you keep it

CHLOE AND YU	(SINGING) Till the end of time

UMA	Wait, that's her?

CHLOE	Amarna Vicario. Yeah, her new sound is real neat.

CHLOE	She's also...

YU	A drunk.

CHLOE	That's not nice.

YU	It's true.

CHLOE	Look, I hear her parents are super conservative...and they've got get here on detox before they drag her back home. It really must not be easy being famous.

YU	Yeah, it's so not easy being famous.

CHLOE	Think about the pressure. No wonder she drinks, poor thing.

YU	She's kind of tragic.

CHLOE	Don't judge her!

UMA	What do you want?

AMARNA	Still mad about this morning?

UMA	You think?

AMARNA	Well, they were gonna catch you either way... and I couldn't let them find our cave.

UMA	"Our cave"?

AMARNA	Of course. Where else are you gonna light up my cigarettes for me? Hey... Please don't believe everything you hear about me. I don't even drink anymore.

UMA	Then why are you here?

AMARNA	Well... I wanted to do music in my own voice. My team freaked out. You see, they look at me like a product. They planted all those partying stories about me... and sent me here... to rehab for it, I guess.

UMA	Why haven't you tried to escape?

AMARNA	Escape from what?

UMA	I don't know exactly, but I'm not trying to get brainwashed here.

AMARNA	Well, the only thing we've done till now is a lot of yoga and feeling our feelings.

UMA	I don't care. I'm getting out of here.

AMARNA	Well, I don't know how you think you're gonna do that... because we're on an island in the middle of the ocean.

UMA	Tonight.

AMARNA	Okay. I'll help you. Meet me outside my room. Midnight.

UMA	Hey. How do you get cigarettes?

AMARNA	An attendant gives them to me. His daughter's a fan. I video chat with her. You know, Uma...there's always a way to get what you want. Always.

DUCHESS	My dears, the sun is rising...and in the fresh light of this new day... let us welcome Chloe, Yu, and Uma...to our family.



AMARNA	Hey.

UMA	Can you...?

AMARNA	Sure. Sorry, I fell asleep. How long did you wait for me?

UMA	I actually fell asleep, too.

ASSISTANT 1	Please confirm your chosen look.

CHLOE	Hell yes.

YU	No, no. I gotta... I'm gonna just...

ASSISTANT 1	Please, mademoiselle.

YU	Can't do it.

ASSISTANT 1	The look may grow on you.

CHLOE	It looks good.

YU	It isn't me.

UMA	Mommy's perfect little Upper.

AMARNA	You don't have to change who you are, Uma.

ASSISTANT 1	Relax, Uma. This will only take a minute. Please sit still, mademoiselle.

UMA	It's like looking at somebody else.

YU	Yeah...someone I don't like.

DUCHESS	Dearest. How are you adjusting, honey?

UMA	Great. I've always wanted to go to a fascist boarding school...

UMA	so this is kind of a dream come true.

DUCHESS	Well, I certainly hope we can change that for you.

FAVORITE 1	Please sit and face the mirror. Please sit down.

DUCHESS	Uma, I know you think this isn't the place for you... and you may be right. But I'm asking you to be the tiniest bit receptive.

UMA	To your propaganda?

DUCHESS	We are at our best when we are truly ourselves. Can we agree on that? Mirror Therapy is about owning your story. It's about remembering what makes you you. Only the things that you would know. Tell yourself the story of who you truly are.

UMA	You want me to talk to myself?

DUCHESS	Well, you don't seem to enjoy talking to me. How about this? I'll ask you a question. Answer only if you want to, okay? What was the one thing your mother never gave you?

UMA	What?

DUCHESS	Try and look in the mirror. Does she look after you?

UMA	She looks after herself.

DUCHESS	You're very tough on her.

UMA	She deserves it.

DUCHESS	Do you love her?

UMA	What are you trying to do here? Okay, I'm not gonna marry that prick.

DUCHESS	It's hard to find a good man in this world, Uma. I would know.

GYM-KARAOKE	Keep it up, mesdemoiselles. Control of the body, clarity of the mind. All right. And work in pairs now, please.

UMA	Yu. Come on.

YU	No.

UMA	I need a partner.

GYM-KARAOKE	And forward.

UMA	Come on, I can't do this on my own. Come on.

GYM-KARAOKE	And back. And forward. And back. Forward. And back. And back. Uma? Uma. Are you still with us?

UMA	Yeah. Sorry.

GYM-KARAOKE	Okay. And forward. And back.
