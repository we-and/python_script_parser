NOLA	The Black Female Form. Wide-Hipped and Honey-Dipped under the Sun and under the constant gaze of... men..y, many. I’ve always wanted to paint Shemekka that special brand of Brooklyn Brown. BK All Day. Never apologizing for the Suck of her Teeth, the Snap of her Neck or how she moves her Black Female Form through the World: Zero. Fucks. Given.
SHEMEKKA	‘Member? 2006! Crown Heights House party! Mad Niggas! DJ was Fiyah! I was on the dance floor ‘whinin’, KILLIN’ it, when this crazy Broad spilled her drink on me! NOLA I did not! You bumped into me! Now pose.
SHEMEKKA	I almost Bust Dat Ass! But I took Mercy on you and look at us now!
NOLA	You nostalgic ass! Enough memories Dance Hall Queen!
SHEMEKKA	Make me look amazing so Nadia’s father he can see what he missing. What? I’m serious. Pussy hole act like I’m crazy just cuz I don’t want my chile around his Big-Booty-havin’Freak-of-Da-Week.
NOLA	Freak of the week? Didn’t they move in together?
SHEMEKKA	So. It ain’t official ‘til she take his last name. Even then, my daughter is NOT callin’ that Bitch Mommy! Ooh. Maybe this little Painting can be my little Fuck you Housewarming Gift, right? Lemme see.
NOLA	Not yet!
SHEMEKKA	“Not yet”. I finally get painted by the One and Only Nola Darling and she won’t let me see Da Shit that’s gonna make a nigga wish he aint jet for no Big Booty bitch!
NOLA	You need to Cut It. Maybe Iyanla-fix that anger, and I told you this painting is for the Catlett Prize.
SHEMEKKA	The What-let Prize?
NOLA	Elizabeth Catlett. It’s a Grant for Visual Artists. They usually go for more feminist work. Hence the Portrait. They only choose Three Artists but it’s Fifteen Stacks if they choose me.
SHEMEKKA	Wow.
NOLA	But ain't nobody choosing me if your Ass don’t keep still. Shit...
SHEMEKKA	Fine! Just remember to...
NOLA	...I know! Long and Silky. I got you.
SHEMEKKA	Can’t get my Silky sewn ‘til next week. Winny would be givin’ me Umpteen jobs to do and it be one damn Check. Maybe when you get your Fifteen Gs...
NOLA	No no no no no. If I get it, I’m paying Five months rent in advance and then I'm painting all damn Day and Night. I’m tired of this Hustle.
SHEMEKKA	Let's go.
NOLA	 Are you serious?
WINNY WIN	My name ain't damn sure ain't no motherfucking black bi... What the fuck? ...Catch this motherfucker, man.
SHEMEKKA	Well, you can always be ‘Artistic’ down at the Hot-N-Trot!
NOLA	wwww!
SHEMEKKA	Cramp?
NOLA	No, this is where he grabbed me.
SHEMEKKA	Fuck. Bad enough he bruised you. You got Cloves?
NOLA	In the Cabinet. I already put Ice on it... Oh my goodness. I can't.
SHEMEKKA	We need to preserve that Hand, Ma! That’s Fideen Stacks right there! Seriously. You okay? You ain’t said nuffin’ since it happened.
NOLA	I’m Fine. It’s like I told Clo, I'm moving forward.
SHEMEKKA	Mm hm.
NOLA	I am.
SHEMEKKA	You tell dese Dudes you seein’ what happened?
NOLA	I will. Eventually.
SHEMEKKA	You should tell them! If they’re not just some Jump offs, they should know.
NOLA	It’s not finished. It's beautiful, right?
SHEMEKKA	Look at my Eyes...
NOLA	What?
SHEMEKKA	You couldn’t make my Ass a Lil’ bigger?
NOLA	Are you for real? I already agreed to this Fake Phantom ass Weave...
SHEMEKKA	I agreed to pose for you, that's the least you could do...
NOLA	The least I could do, is paint something realistic.
SHEMEKKA	What da Fuck dat mean? Did I make a mistake confidin’ a certain bit of information to you? ’Cuz if I'd known you’d be all Judgy and Shit...
NOLA	Hold the fuck up! You’re not going through with it, though?
SHEMEKKA	I told you- I’m thinkin’ ‘bout it. Look it's not like I said I was gonna sign up for ‘She Ass’d For It’!
CASH	And this is TV’s ONLY competition where Contestants get to compete for a complete BOOTY OVERHAUL! Yes!
SHEMEKKA	What? Don’t make that Face. I told you I wasn’t gonna do it.
NOLA 	Good.
SHEMEKKA	The Show, I mean.
NOLA	Oh my God. You do not need to do that Shit to your Body!
SHEMEKKA	It's not up to you Boo.
NOLA	But you’re already Gorgeous.
SHEMEKKA	I never said I wasn’t! I just....Wait, you mean to tell me that if I had a Magic wand and could change anything ‘bout your body, that you wouldn’t want nuffin’ tweaked?
NOLA	Nope.
SHEMEKKA	Blood Clots.
NOLA	I’m serious. I accept what I got and what I don’t got.
SHEMEKKA	I gots NO ASS, okay!? Me uh come from Yard, Land of Big Batty Gyal but God took my Damn Jamaican Birfright.
NOLA	Why don't you do some squats?
SHEMEKKA	If one more person tells me to do a damn squat. It doesn't work, if you've got a Flat Ass like me, it just makes your ass Flatter.
NOLA	It just seems...so unnecessary.
SHEMEKKA	To you!
NOLA	What about Nadia?
SHEMEKKA	What about her?
NOLA	You know, it’s hard enough for little Black Girls being told they’re ugly and they're not pretty enough. What if Nadia sees you changing your body and starts to think something’s wrong with hers?
SHEMEKKA	I told you it was something I was thinkin’ ‘bout, but if you can’t be my Friend and support me...
NOLA	Oh my goodness, chill ! Don't be so dramatic. I may not agree with this Shit but you’re My Girl for life, right? From Womb to Tomb?
SHEMEKKA	Birth to Earth.
NOLA	Salty ass.
SHEMEKKA	And don't tell Clo Neevah.
NOLA	I won't
SHEMEKKA	Don't need her Nosy, Uppity Ass in my Biz!

STOKELY	Better be! The Good Lord provides, but do you know how much I had to pay for these Damn Steaks?! Fuck these Newbie Motherfuckers and their inflation bringing asses!
SEPTIMA	Stokes is still salty. Someone popped up offering to buy the Brownstone.
NOLA	Again?
STOKELY	People like, what part of “Fuck Off” don’t they get? I ain’t leavin’ Fort Green. I don't care how much Money they got in their brief case. Do you know that these Brownstones are going for...
SEPTIMA/NOLA	...“20 times what we paid in 1978!?”	
STOKELY	Tease all you want. But, a broken Record scratches the Needle, Baby.
SEPTIMA	So how is everything with you, Hun?
NOLA	No, I mean, things are good. Just applying for some Grants.
SEPTIMA	GREAT! So you’re okay with money?
NOLA	Yeah, just okay. I’m still teaching on the side, it doesn’t pay a whole lot but it covers the bills.
STOKELY	Well all of us Artists gotta Work, Baby.
SEPTIMA	We should have sent you to Medical School, so you wouldn’t have to scrounge like your Artsy Fartsy Father and Me.
NOLA	Mom stop it. I’m working on a new Piece... It’s not finished yet but...
SEPTIMA	Mhh! Oh my god, Stokes, you see this?
STOKELY	Woah! Powerful, Baby! Whatchu call that?

STOKELY	She Free Alright!
SEPTIMA	Stokes! Come here baby. Give me a kiss.
STOKELY	I’m just sayin’... No doubt my Baby got God in her Fingers. Just like her daddy.
NOLA	Thanks Dad.
SEPTIMA	I don’t get you Two. You’re so... and Shemekka's just, she's just basic...
NOLA	...Like one of my best Friends who’s expressing herself. Play nice.
SEPTIMA	No, you be nice, you listen. You... Expressing herself would be interchanging her Straight with her own Hair. You ever see her Natural Hair? She's hiding all that Beautiful Brown behind all that Weave.
NOLA	Maybe it’s just part of her armor. Is that so bad, to need a little something? I mean, we’ve all used things to Cope.
GREER	Come here, let me show you something.
NOLA	Okay.
GREER	Alright, somebody grabs your wrist, there's three things you do. One: Trap. Two: Lock.

NOLA	Okay. Trap! Lock! Turn!
GREER	Yes.

PAPO	Ah, yeah, I see you. I see you dancing. You like it. You like it. I'm going to turn it up a little more so you can hear it. You can hear it, right? Damn!
BIANCA	Papo!

PAPO	Go somewhere else?
BIANCA	Please.
PAPO	Are you kidding me? Hey listen, listen. I got some art. You want to buy some art? Huh? I'm working on that new piece right there, one percent. Hey? I guess that's a no.
JAMIE	Hey Nola. I know things are kind of complicated between us right now. I just... I’m just thinking about you and I want you to know that I’m here, Alright?
MARS	Last night, Nola did some freaky shit.
GIRL	Oh yeah? Seriously though, but like, that ass, I sucked toes for the first time and that shit was crazy. I'm not the sucking toes kind of dude, and I never thought I would be doing some shit like that, but yo, she got nice ass toes dude. Yeah she fucked my head up with that shit, and I'm like, I'm like I can suck them toes again, that shit was crazy.
GIRL	Oh God. You... You were into it?
PAPO	Wooh. Slow down, Ma, slow down.
NOLA	Hey, Papo.
PAPO	Yeah! How you doing girl? I got that, I got that.

CAESAR	My eyes! My eyes! I'm blind!
NOLA	Shit.
JAMIE	 Hey. How you doing?
CHERYL	Fine. How are you?
JAMIE	Fine, fine.
CHERYL	 My feet are killing me. Goodnight.
JAMIE	Cheryl.
CHERYL	Yes?
JAMIE	You should be more careful coming home late at night.
CHERYL	Jamie. Are you serious? We live on the safest block in Brooklyn.
RACHEL	They were moving in the other. And they are moving in all this, like, identical furniture. They're twins, and like...
NOLA	Right, right.
RACHEL	… so everything is symmetrical. And it's like weird, kind of, that they still live together, but like, they're really hot.
NOLA	I can't believe I haven't met them yet. That's so weird.
RACHEL	Just really... I mean, just saying. I love Pat Hall’s Dance and Movement Afro-Caribbean Class. 
NOLA	Me too.
RACHEL	It's so good. Okay, see you next week.
NOLA	See you at home.
SHEMEKKA	I bet you Rachel only Fucks African Dudes. Seen any Mandingos comin’ outcha Brownstone? I knew it! “I love Pat Hall’s Dance and Movement Afro-Caribbean Class.”
NOLA	So rude.
CLORINDA	Danton wants to observe.
SHEMEKKA	Observe.....? The Class.
NOLA	Sounds tantalizing; your Old Boyfriend watching us do African Dance.
CLORINDA	First of all he’s only 52. And secondly, he’s NOT my Boyfriend.
SHEMEKKA	No, just some old White Dude watchin’ us shake our Black Booties! My Bad. I mean, we can’t all be like Nola dating Three Hot Black Single dudes at once!
CLORINDA	Last time I checked, not all of her lovers were single.
NOLA	Rude. I told you it was complicated.
SHEMEKKA	Meaning?
NOLA	Meaning, Jamie takes good care of me and says his present situation is in...”Transition”. In any case, I told him that Piece of Shit put His hands on Me. I told all of them.
SHEMEKKA	‘Bout time.
CLORINDA	How you doing?
NOLA	I thought I was fine but I maced some Random Guy last night.
CLORINDA	You what?!
NOLA	All he wanted was to say ‘good job’ and PSSSHH! I send him screaming and crying down the street.
SHEMEKKA	Shit.
CLORINDA	Sorry, but it's better him than you, right ? I mean come on, Nola, admit it. Felt good  just busting one off.
NOLA	Did I enjoy hurting an innocent Stranger, no? But if I’m being perfectly honest, it felt...
CLORINDA	...Good...
NOLA	...Like, like Clapping back at what I thought was another Asshole trying to grab up on me.
CLORINDA	Oh my God.
CASH	Wanna get that junk, in your trunk? Let's get it going baby. Look at all that ass!
CLORINDA	Do you see that? I mean who in their right mind...?
NOLA 	.. I know, right. Dumb Reality Shows.
CLORINDA	It’s not just the show. I mean, any woman that's willing to alter her body is willing to affirm the male- gaze. It’s just so passe.
SHEMEKKA	Says the Girl with the Knock-Out Body.
What?
SHEMEKKA	Why you always gotta be so Judgey?
NOLA	I don’t think she meant...
CLORINDA	No I meant it! I mean, how many steps back must we take, ladies? ‘She Ass’d For it’?!Huh, I bet a guy came up with that shit! You hear that? POW! Harriet Tubman just shot herself with a pistol from the grave!
NOLA	Clo...
CLORINDA	No I'm serious! I mean what’s the point of freeing our bodies if all we’re gonna do is just carve them up?
NOLA	Isn’t freedom also having the right to do whatever you will with your own body?
CLORINDA	I bet you Michelle Obama isn’t about to start carving herself up anytime soon. Nope! She’s just way too busy being unapologetically Black & Flyyyy! Am I lying?!
NOLA	No lie.
SHEMEKKA	No lie.
NOLA	For the states, gowned up and tiiight!
CLORINDA	Sure you right!
SHEMEKKA	I’m out.
NOLA	You don’t want to go grab smoothies?
SHEMEKKA	Y’all go ‘head. I gotta get Nadia from daycare. Deuces.
CLORINDA	What was that about?
NOLA	Mekk, I call you later, okay?
CLORINDA	Nola. Nola! You haven't heard a damn thing that I've said, hello girl! That's the place I've been telling you about. The inaugural Diastopian art exhibition? 
NOLA	Diastopian? Clo, what the hell is that?
CLORINDA	Diastopian. It's a phrase, coined by moi. Yes. It's a movement. Of forward thinking, Afrocentric artists, reaching across boundaries, to fabulate, deconstruct, redefine, assert and expand the breath and reach of millennial voices from the African diaspora. It's about love and like.
CLORINDA	Thank you.
NOLA	This place is so dope. Right? I'm gonna bring so much black art into this white gallery people are going to think that they are in mother Africa. Can we just take a moment please, and absorb?
NOLA	Uhh, crazy!
CLORINDA	That's gonna be the biggest show that I've ever curated.
NOLA	Yeah.
CLORINDA	And... I want you to be a part of it.
NOLA	Stop playing!
CLORINDA	I'm gonna kill you if say no.
NOLA	Yes!
CLORINDA	Yes?
NOLA	Yes. Yes! Oh my goodness, you know the last show I did was at that shit-hole gallery in Sunset Park?
CLORINDA	God, I hate that dude that runs that place, Gustav. He smells like fried pork dumplings and tequila.
NOLA	He really does. You know, a grand total of seven people signed my guest book, and two of them were my parents. I woke up this morning, staring down that blank canvas like, when's the last time I sold a painting to someone who wasn't just interested in fucking me. You have no idea how badly I needed this.
CLORINDA	Girl, who you telling? We both do. You're gonna freak, but Baptiste said yes to doing the show.
NOLA	Baptiste? The Baptiste?!
CLORINDA	The Baptiste!
NOLA	What?!
CLORINDA	You know what that means? Like, every dealer, every collector, every altor is gonna be up in here representing.
NOLA	Like, who the fuck are you?
CLORINDA	I know, it's real and it scares the shit out of me.
NOLA	Oh, it shouldn't. When's this happening?
CLORINDA	Hum, I haven't set the dates yet, so just keep it on the QT.
NOLA	Oh, on the lowest of lows.
CLORINDA	Move over Wangechi Mutu, our collector's getting ready for miss Nola Darling.
ALBIN	What are you two doing around here?
NOLA	Who the fuck are you yelling at?
CLORINDA	Nola, chill, chill, chill, relax. Hi, Chapin Calloway gave me the keys.
ALBIN	Ok, leave the keys at the counter when you leave.
CLORINDA	Okay.
NOLA	I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to explode. I guess I just have a lot on my mind since the assault.
CLORINDA	Girl, you need to talk to somebody. I'm gonna text you a number, okay? She's a sister.
NOLA	I don't know, you know I'm not really down with the therapy thing.
MADAME LARISSA	A Negative Entity sipped through a Hole in your Aura. I can banish it for two thousand American dollars.
NZINGHA	I’m collecting a lot of the Bad energy. Leave my sister. Leave my sister. You should feel much lighter. Look. See.
MARS	Welcome to Fort Green Projects.
NOLA	I hope this works.
MARS	After you, Seniorita.
LOURDES	Fresh water. Fresh path. Fresh home. I give you praise, Ellegua (Alegua?).
LOURDES	Alright, let see what Alegua has for miss Nola.
NOLA	Okay.
LOURDES	Come forward. Let me get your shoulders. Take this, give it a kiss, pray for what you want. Alright, just drop it here. Okay. Hmm, interesting.
NOLA	What?
LOURDES	What Alegua says to me here, is that there is a dark energy that surrounds you. You know how you walking alone at night and you feel something behind you? In your case it's like...it's almost like the shape of a black spider.
MARS	A Black Spider?!
LOURDES	You know I can’t read with you in the room. Like largate, before I read you too!
MARS	Alright, I’m outty 5 Geez. Yo, exit, Stage Left.
LOURDES	Okay bye, mmhmm.
NOLA	Is that all I have to do to get rid of him?
LOURDES	Girl, he gets on my damn nerves. So, my crazy brother tells me that you're an artist? 'Cause, another thing that I'm seeing here is that something’s haunting your work. Whatever this is doesn't want to see you succeed, it's trying to hold your work down. And you know it's very important for an artist to protect their message. I know you feel this, no?
NOLA	What if I don’t believe in this?
LOURDES	Santo Tomas (Saint Tomas). Tienes que ver para creer. Meaning you have to see to believe. It’s not my job to prove this, that this is real and that this actually works. Because you'll see, and Alegua will show you.
NOLA	Shemekka. She’s Silky. I’m Kinky. I’m Pinot Noir. She’s Moscato. But that’s my Girl for Life. True, she comes off like a tough Crown Heights Goddess but aren’t the tough ones always a little extra soft on the inside?  The Black Female Form. I’ve grown protective of it... My foolish attempt to control The Gaze of Gawkers who think The Black Female Form is simply here for their Consumption. Their Scrutiny, their Enjoyment, their grabbing Hands when all The Black Female Form wants to be is ... Free. Shemekka.
MARS	Oh hell to the no!
