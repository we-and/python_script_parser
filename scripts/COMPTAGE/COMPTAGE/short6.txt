THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching..? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Spencer is on his way from the mainland to Sodor. To get there he must cross the Vicarstown Rolling Bridge.

THE EARL OF SODOR	The bridge lifts up to allow ships to pass underneath.

THE EARL OF SODOR	When this happens engines and their passengers need to wait at the barrier.

THE EARL OF SODOR	But when the barrier lifts, it's time for Spencer to get going again.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	What colour are the stripes on the Vicarstown Bridge Barrier?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are they blue and white? Yellow and  white? Or green and white?

THE EARL OF SODOR	The stripes on the barrier are yellow and white! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Now Spencer can race across the bridge to Sodor with his passenger, who, of course, is me!

THE EARL OF SODOR	HOORAY! That was fun. Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	When there's a fire on Sodor Flynn needs to put it out quickly. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	To help him get to the fire fast he can travel on the tracks or by road.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Today Flynn is traveling by road but he's not traveling very fast now, is he!?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Why did Flynn stop?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Did his driver lose his shoes? Was a sheep in the road? Did Flynn have a flat tyre?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Flynn had a flat tyre, but it didn't take long to fix and now he's ready for action.

THE EARL OF SODOR	time!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Jolly Well done! Do come back again soon. Goodbye!
