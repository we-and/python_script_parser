SPEAKER	 ...so without further ado, ladies and gentlemen... 
SPEAKER	I present to you the Governor of this great state of ours, and dare I say, the future president of these United States... Please welcome Governor John Francis! 
AUDIENCE	<cheering, applause> 
FRANCIS 	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for coming out on this very special night. 
AUDIENCE	<cheering> 
FRANCIS 	Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Washingtonians, we live in dangerous times - times riddled with adversity. But it is only through challenges that great opportunities present themselves to change our very future. 
AUDIENCE	<applause> 
FRANCIS 	Christ, I could use a stiff drink...  
FRANCIS 	...and some SportsCenter. These speeches are starting to get a little... 
SECRET SERVICE 	Rote, sir? 
FRANCIS 	Well, I was going to go with soul-sucking, but yes, now that I'm running for President, I guess rote does sound better. 
FRANCIS 	Come on, guys, is this really necessary? 
SECRET SERVICE 	Down! 
FRANCIS 	Do I know you? If you pull that trigger, I guarantee you my guys will not stop, not until you're found, captured and killed. 
SWAT MEMBER 	Police! Move! Move, move, move! 
SWAT MEMBER 	Police! Hands in the air!  Hands where I can see them! 
SWAT MEMBER 	Hands in the air! 
SWAT MEMBER  	Watch out, he's got a bomb!  
SWAT MEMBER 	He's got a bomb! Down! 
GABRIEL (VO) 	<coughing and spitting> 
GABRIEL	<coughing> 
BRINN 	Jesus, baby. Are you okay? 
GABRIEL 	Uh huh... <coughing> 
BRINN 	I warned you, can't mix the grain with the grape. 
GABRIEL 	Were we drinking last night? 
BRINN 	Yeah, with the Addisons. We had wine with dinner and then you drank whiskey with Phil.  
GABRIEL 	I have this worst headache, too. 
BRINN 	Oh, here... Here you go, tough guy. 
GABRIEL 	Hm. Thanks. 
TALK SHOW HOST 	Dr. Connelly, it's a pleasure to have you here to talk about the brain, the body and the connections that you have made between the two. Now, I have read about identical twins being separated at birth. They grew up in... 
BRINN	I hope Jesse got the register fixed.  
TALK SHOW HOST	...yet they have the same hobbies. They wear the same clothes. They have the same hairstyle, even down to the same type of dog. But you are suggesting something so much more. 
DR. CONNELLY	Well, something deeper in their DNA. My research has shown in some cases these types of twins can share some of the same emotions and memories due to synaptic, possibly even telepathic, convergence. 
TALK SHOW HOST	That's interesting. What made you go down that path? 
GABRIEL 	That aspirin actually helped. 
BRINN 	Good. You look better.  
GABRIEL 	You ready to go? FEMALE CUSTOMER  	So have you been before? Like would you want to go or...? 
FEMALE CUSTOMER	<indistinct chatter> 
JESSE 	Pancakes there... om... uh, scrambled there. 
JESSE 	Sarah, I was thinking maybe when you-- 
SARAH 	No. No, Jesse. Just, no 
JESSE 	You see what she does to me? 
GABRIEL	Jesse? 
SARAH 	It's 'cause you ask every time. 
JESSE 	The bitch thought I wasn't good enough. Do I look "not good enough" to you? 
BRINN 	Jesse, honey. Table six. 
JESSE	All right, I get it. Wait. Uh, Okay. Alright. Alright.  
SHERIFF 	Good morning, Gabriel. 
GABRIEL 	Morning, Sheriff. 
SHERIFF 	Brinn, how's it going, darlin'? 
BRINN 	Not bad. Oh, Gabe, Jesse said that he could take me home tonight. I got my cookin' class.  
SHERIFF	You know, before we kilt 'em all, the Indians believed that when you died, you were reborn. Over and over and over.  Called it reincarnation. 
JESSE 	I think you mean Buddhists. 
SHERIFF	Well, either way, it kinda makes you wonder why there was ever any law and order. I mean, if you're just gonna wake up again, then why not kill your friend and fuck his wife? <laughing> 
GABBRIEL 	Well, you better be careful. Buddhists also believe in bad karma. You could come back as that fly. 
SHERIFF 	Well, when I was fightin' in Iraq, we were fightin' for the right reasons... to protect you and your flies.  
BRINN 	<softly gasps> Hey... 
GABRIEL	Hi.  	
BRINN 	Those for me? 
GABRIEL 	Um. No I was gonna have a date... but they cancelled.  
BRINN	I got a knife in my hand, do not tease me. 
GABRIEL 	I will keep that in mind.  
BRINN 	Thirteen.  
GABRIEL 	Lucky number.  
BRINN 	It's only the sixth. My birthday's not for another week.  
GABRIEL 	Well, consider it an early gift, in case I forget like last year. 
BRINN	If you like the stew tonight, we can put it on the new menu. 
MALE VOCALIST 	<singing> We live in the time When no one knows how to live Just let them all pretend Who they've never been before Who am I 
 BRINN	Gabe, honey, you're having a seizure. Talk to me. Baby, talk to me. Talk to me, please. 
JACK 	<humming> 
JULIA 	Beer's nice and cold.  
JULIA	Jack? 
JACK	 Yes, dear. 
JULIA 	Why did you have to become a politician? 
JACK 	You know why, dear, to make a difference. 
JULIA 	Then let's stop going to those insufferable events and go to Africa and make a real difference. 
JACK 	I thought we were still talking about beer. 
JULIA	I don't know, republic of Congo is povertystricken, isn't it? Maybe we should go to the Congo. 
JACK 	Mmm... 
JULIA 	Want a beer? 
JACK 	Mmm. <smacks lips> Tasty. You know, I can't tell if you are smart or naughty. 
JULIA 	You'll have to find out, won't you? <laughs> 
JACK 	Let's do some fishin'. Bring me some peanuts. 
JULIA 	All right.  
JACK 	<grunting> Who sent you?! Get back! 
JULIA 	Oh my God, Jack! 
JACK 	Julia, back inside. 
JACK 	Who the fuck sent you? Huh? SOL? Who was it? S&B? 
JACK 	<grunting> 
JULIA 	Let him go! Stop it! Stop or I'll shoot! 
JACK 	Argh...! 
JACK 	<grunting> 
GABRIEL 	<gasping, coughing> <panting> 
BRINN	You're scaring me. You can't do this. When you wake up from dreams, you gotta just try and forget about it. 
GABRIEL 	It's so... it's so vivid. Every fuckin' scene. Every heartbeat. I have no control. Something's fucking wrong with me! <crying> I don't know what to do... 
BRINN 	You're going to be okay. 
DR. REESE 	Gabriel.  
GABRIEL 	Dr. Reese. 
DR. REESE 	A pleasure to finally meet you. 
GABRIEL 	It's good to meet you.  
DR. REESE 	Why don't you come inside? Please, have a seat. 
GABRIEL	Well, it's...everything's white. Very... comforting.  
DR. REESE 	Precisely. I've looked at your medical records. Brain scan, MRI, seem normal. This seems psychologically-based. 
GABRIEL 	I'm really just here for her.  
DR. REESE 	Ah, Brinn? 
GABRIEL 	Yeah.  
DR. REESE 	So tell me about these dreams you've been having. 
GABRIEL 	Sometimes they just feel real, that's all. 
DR. REESE 	Your wife says she found you sleep-walking once. 
GABRIEL 	This is more like I wake up and I'm not really sure if I was dreaming or not. 
DR. REESE 	Gabriel, the unconscious dream can become borderline conscious. Like you're awake but you're still dreaming. You want to wake up and get out of there but you can't. To a certain extent we all have these so-called waking dreams. 
GABRIEL 	In my waking dreams... I'm chasing people. I'm killing them.  
DR. REESE	The mind stores everything -- television news, movies, billboards. Then these thoughts, these visual cues can return to us quite vividly in waking dreams. How is your relationship with your wife? 
GABRIEL 	What are you suggesting? 
DR. REESE 	I don't make suggestions, I ask questions. 
GABRIEL 	I don't know. We fight, I guess sometimes. She's shoved me a few times but... am I going crazy? 
DR. REESE 	No. You're a hardworking man, Gabriel. And you're stressed.  
GABRIEL 	When I wake up from these dreams I get terrible headaches.  
DR. REESE 	If you can tolerate it, aspirin would be best. I'm also going to put on a mild sedative. One tablet in the morning, one tablet in the evening.  
GABRIEL 	And that's it? Just take a pill.  
DR. REESE 	Gabriel... sometimes our problems are not as complex as we'd hoped. This should help with the sleep and the anxiety. 
 RADIO DJ 	Now, tell me that song doesn't make you want to dial up your old high school sweetheart. Come down to Estelle's Department Store where you're always treated like family. Estelle's -- home away from home. 
MALE VOCALIST 	<singing> We live in the time When no one knows how to live Just let them all pretend Who they've never been before Who am I What is my destination It seems I have reached To the ends of my dream Now stop Betraying yourself Now stop 
ANNOUNCER	...investigation continues. The murdersuicide came as a shock to friends and family, stating, Jack Kenneth and his wife--  
SUITED MAN	That's not your job. You don't understand. I don't care. I don't care if they're left or right or center It's all the same game.  Right. I understand that you don't understand.  <indistinct PA chatter> 
SUITED MAN 	No. No, look... no, that's not your job. I'm catching the train. I'll call you later. Hey, officer. How you doing? 
POLICE OFFICER 	Okay. 
SUITED MAN 	See that guy at the vending machine over there? He's a little weird. Just hope you keep an eye on him. 
POLICE OFFICER 	Right. 
 POLICE OFFICER 	Can I help you? 
GABRIEL 	I'm... yes. I'm late for a meeting. Is it the yellow or the red line to midtown? 
POLICE OFFICER 	Yellow. 
GABRIEL 	Yellow? 
 POLICE OFFICER 	Right over there. 
CROWD 	<screams> 
POLICE OFFICER	Freeze! 
POLICE OFFICER 	Please! I have a-- 
GABRIEL 	<coughing, spitting>   <panting>   <loud grunting> 
BRINN	Gabriel, what are you doing? 
GABRIEL	Do not fucking touch me. 
BRINN 	What the fuck are you doing? 
GABRIEL	Back the fuck off. What happened to me last night? 
 BRINN 	What do you mean? 
GABRIEL 	I want to know what happened to me last night. 
BRINN 	I don't know. We... went to work. We served customers. Jesse liked the lamb stew and we decided to put it on the menu. What? Is that what you want to know? 
GABRIEL 	Okay. And what happened after? 
BRINN 	After? 
GABRIEL 	Yeah.  
BRINN 	You stayed with Jesse. I went home. You guys talked about girls. You came home, you went to bed, I woke you up. 
GABRIEL 	No! No! No! No! That is not what happened! Do not fucking lie to me! 
BRINN 	That is what happened--  
GABRIEL 	Do not lie. 
BRINN 	Gabriel It is what happened. 
GABRIEL 	Do not fucking lie to me. 
BRINN 	I'm not fuckin' lying to you. 
GABRIEL 	Bullshit! 
BRINN 	Why would I lie to you? 
GABRIEL 	Bullshit, you aren't lying to me. 
BRINN 	Why? Why would I lie to you? 
GABRIEL 	I don't know!  Because you think I'm fuckin' crazy! 
BRINN 	No, I think that you're sick. And that you need help.  
GABRIEL 	Bullshit. 
BRINN 	There's something wrong with you. 
GABRIEL 	Jack Kenneth. 
BRINN 	What? 
GABRIEL 	Jack Kenneth. In my dreams, the man I killed. I looked him up. He's a fuckin' Washington, D.C. guy. Look him up. Look him the fuck up! 
BRINN 	We all know that he was murdered, Gabriel. You're putting yourself in the news, in your head. You need to talk to Dr. Reese again, okay? You need to go see him... 'cause I can't take this anymore. 
GABRIEL 	Fuckin'...  
GABRIEL  	Um, I need to... I need to wash my hands. 
 DEPUTY WALLACE 	Afternoon. Somethin' I can do you for? 
GABRIEL 	Yes. Um, is Sheriff Hodge in? 
DEPUTY WALLACE 	He's on a call. Can I help you with anything? 
GABRIEL 	No. I'll... I'll wait.  
DEPUTY WALLACE 	Well, he's kind a busy. 
GABRIEL 	This is kind of important so... 
DEPUTY TRUVIO 	Sir, we said he's busy.  
GABRIEL 	Right. And I said I'll wait.  
SHERIFF HODGE 	What the hell's going on out there? 
GABRIEL 	Can I talk to you for one second, please? 
SHERIFF HODGE  	Get on in here. 
GABRIEL 	Thank you. Enjoy your donut. 
DEPUTY WALLACE 	Huh. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Okay, what's so urgent? 
GABRIEL  	This is gonna sound crazy. Okay, just please bear with me. Here we go... copies. 
These two men, they were killed. And they were killed while they were doing something important.  
SHERIFF HODGE	Gabriel, we know they were killed. You doin' okay?  How's the Brinn? 
GABRIEL 	She's... she's fine. But listen, these men, right, that were killed... someone benefited from their death.  
SHERIFF HODGE 	Uh, that'll be all, Deputy. And shut the door on your way out. Listen, both your parents passing away last year, you taking over the diner... it's a full plate. You're doin' a helluva job.  
GABRIEL 	We're trying.  
SHERIFF HODGE 	You and I, let's hunt some deer this fall, like old times. Okay?  Truvio... He's having dangerous thoughts. Keep an eye on him.  
GABRIEL 	Hey. Delivery come? 
JESSE 	Yeah, it's in the back. I also forgot to tell you that the dishwasher's on the fritz again, man. 
GABRIEL 	Oh, seriously? 
JESSE 	Yeah.  
GABRIEL 	It was working fine yesterday. 
JESSE 	Oh, I dunno... I think it's the hydro line, though.  
GABRIEL 	If not, we'll have to replace the whole damn thing and I just cannot afford that right now. I'll run to the hardware store after the morning rush. 'Til then we'll just have to wash 'em by hand. 
JESSE 	By "we" you mean me, right?
GABRIEL 	"Underpaid and over worked." Oh, heard it all before. 
JESSE 	Yeah.  
GABRIEL 	<groaning> 
JESSE 	You okay? Hey.  
GABRIEL	<labored breathing> 
JESSE 	Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? 
GABRIEL 	Who do you work for? 
JESSE 	What are you talking about? I'm -- 
GABRIEL 	Tell me. God damn it, tell me right now. 
JESSE 	I don't know. 
GABRIEL 	Bullshit! Who told you to play that song? 
JESSE 	Nobody! 
GABRIEL 	Huh? Do not lie to me, Jessie! Who do you work for?! 
JESSE 	You? 
GABRIEL 	Don't lie. 
JESSE 	Please... please don't hurt me. Please. 
GABRIEL 	I'm sorry. You alright? I'm sorry. I've had a rough couple of days. 
JESSE 	What was I supposed to do man? I mean, you're scaring us, dude. You're acting insane, bro. 
GABRIEL 	<groaning> 
BRINN  	God damn it, open the door! Right now! Open it! Open the goddamn door or I'm calling the police!  
GABRIEL 	What the fuck is the matter with you? Huh? 
BRINN 	What is the matter with you? 
GABRIEL 	Huh? 
BRINN 	Am I so unbearable to live with? You can't sleep one night without having a goddamn nightmare!  
GABRIEL 	Really? 
BRINN 	What is wrong with you? 
GABRIEL 	No, what is wrong with you? 
BRINN 	There's nothing wrong with me! It's you!    I found the fuckin' video camera. What are you, a sick freak? What are you trying to do? Televise it or something-- 
GABRIEL 	No! 
BRINN 	You-- 
GABRIEL 	No! Will you stop! Really? 
BRINN 	<panting> 
GABRIEL 	<grunting> 
BRINN 	<moaning> 
BRINN 	What's it like-- 
GABRIEL 	Sometimes... I can feel my heart beat. And I... I just... I can't bring myself to admit that it's just a dream. 
BRINN 	And I want to believe you, I do. But if what you're saying is true, then none of this is real. The diner, the town, our house... me. You feel that? That's real. What we have is good and we're worth fighting for.  
DR. REESE 	The dreams, they getting worse? 
GRABRIEL 	They're not dreams. 
DR. REESE 	So, they're reality? 
GABRIEL 	Who do you work for? 
DR. REESE 	If you would allow me to do my job, maybe you-- 
GABRIEL  	I want to know who you are. I want to know the Reese behind the smile, the uh... the hand shake, the sterile, white bullshit.  
DR. REESE 	We're focusing on you. Are you hearing voices now? 
GABRIEL 	Right. Go ahead. Try to make me doubt myself now.  
DR. REESE 	Is that what you think I'm doing? Are you still having violent thoughts? 
GABRIEL 	I'm starting to really enjoy killing. The more I do it, the more fun it gets.  
DR. REESE 	Do you want my help or not? 
GABRIEL 	Where did you study psychiatry? 
DR. REESE 	With the loss of your parents, your long working hours, your lack of sleep, the lack of trust in yourrelationship, the lack of children in your marriage--  
DR. REESE  	...all of this loss and frustration in...  
DR. REESE 	...your life -- you may be unleashing all this depression and frustration by lashing out in these violent dreams.  I must say I'm becoming very concerned about your lack of progress and for the safety of your wife. Brinn told me you threw out your medication and replaced with Ibuprofen. 
GABRIEL 	Migraines got worse and my dreams got more vivid. 
DR. REESE 	Gabriel, you didn't take the pills. You threw them out.  I'll be right back. 
DR. REESE  	So... Gabriel...  
DR. REESE 	This is a much higher dose of sedative than the last time. It should keep you from making any dangerous decisions. 
GABRIEL 	Thank you. 
MALE VOCALIST 	<singing> ...Just let them all pretend Who they've never been before Who am I And what is my destination It seems I have reached The ends of my dream   Now stop (Be yourself Don't forget who you are What's your name) Betraying yourself (Be yourself Don't forget who you are What's your name) Now stop (Be yourself Don't forget who you are What's your name) Being alone You will be reborn unto the world You cannot await Sharing your life With the people you love And give them the home 
 MALE VOCALIST 	<singing> Have you ever thought That you don't exist at all Everything you feel Is just dust flying in the wind Who am I And who knows what awaits me It seems I have reached The end of my dream  
SHERIFF  	Track him. 
GABRIEL 	Agh! Ah, fuck. 
GABRIEL 	<grunting> 
MAN  	Hey! 
GABRIEL 	Turn around. I'm having another violent dream, doctor. 
DR. REESE 	Brinn's been worried sick about you. She's been looking for you everywhere, Gabriel. Have you hurt yourself? Do you want me to take you to an emergency room? 
 GABRIEL 	Cut the "first, do no harm" bullshit, okay? All right? Who are the Sons of Liberty, hm? 
DR. REESE 	I'm just moving offices, Gabriel. I only came here  to collect your confidential medical records. 
GABRIEL 	No, it's not Gabriel. I'm not Gabriel and you aren't Dr. Reese. 
DR. REESE 	Okay. Who am I? 
GABRIEL	Mmm, Dr. Antone, maybe? Hm? Does that sound right? And this... this lady... she was your wife. 
DR. REESE	I don't know what you're talking about.  Look, my arms are tired. Can I...? 
GABRIEL 	Fine. Your denying this will not save your life. 
DR. REESE 	It was a car accident. And I loved my wife. 
GABRIEL 	It gives you no right to do what you did. None. You didn't give me meds for anxiety, you gave me meds because I was remembering shit!   
DR. REESE 	I didn't want to hurt you, Gabriel! You've got to believe me. You and Brinn are wonderful people. I want the best for you. I never wanted to do you any harm. You and countless others on a grand scale. 
GABRIEL 	Yeah, now you're sounding crazy. 
DR. REESE 	You were just a killing machine.  And this project is independently funded.  
GABRIEL 	The government? 
DR. REESE 	No, not exactly. But we're making great strides in perfecting it.  You won't stop them. And you will never stop me from trying to bring back my wife.  
DR. REESE	Agh! 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Go around back! Come with me.  
GABRIEL 	Brinn? 
GABRIEL 	Get up. 
BRINN 	What are you doing? 
GABRIEL 	Get the fuck up. 
BRINN 	What are you doing? I'm scared right now. What are you doing? What are you doing? 
GABRIEL 	What am I doing? Are you in on it?  Stop, you're scaring me right now. 
GABRIEL 	Are you in on it? 
BRINN 	In on what? 
GABRIEL 	Are you in on it? 
BRINN 	In on what? Gabriel, stop! Stop, I don't know what you're talking about! 
GABRIEL 	Bullshit! Don't lie to me. I'm not really in the mood for lies right now, so sit down... ...and tell me the fucking truth. 
BRINN 	I don't know. 
GABRIEL 	Bullshit! 
BRINN 	I don't know. 
GABRIEL 	God dammit, Brinn, Hodge has been chasing me all fucking day.  
BRINN	Please put the gun down. You're acting fucking insane. 
GABRIEL 	I'm acting insane? I just spoke with Dr. Reese. The doctor that you fucking sent me to.  
BRINN 	<crying> 
GABRIEL 	How much did you fucking betray me?! 
BRINN 	I didn't! 
GABRIEL 	Huh? 
BRINN 	I don't know-- 
GABRIEL 	Bullshit! Goddammit! 
Goddammit. 
  BRINN 	You're acting fucking crazy right now. 
GABRIEL 	Shut up.  Gabriel, please, please don't hurt me. Please. Gabriel, I'm your wife. 
GABRIEL 	Tell me. Tell me. I know. You're my wife. 
BRINN 	It's me, Brinn.  
GABRIEL 	Please, tell me. It's Brinn. I didn't do anything. 
GABRIEL	Tell me everything that you fucking know about Sons of Liberty. Tell me or I swear-- 
BRINN 	You're hurting me! 
GABRIEL 	I need to fucking know something! 
BRINN 	You're hurting  me! 
GABRIEL 	I don't care! I don't care! You fucking ruined my life!  You fucking broke my heart! What the fuck are you doing to me?! 
BRINN 	Okay! Okay. I'm not your wife. <crying> 
GABRIEL 	What? 
BRINN 	I was recruited a year ago but I didn't know that I would meet you. And I didn't know I would fall in love with you and.. and I did it because they hired me! Because I had legal problems, I had money problems. But it wasn't supposed to be like this. I promise you, it wasn't. And they're bad people. And I realized it.  
GABRIEL 	How could you do that to someone? How could you do that to me? 
BRINN 	I don't know! 
GABRIEL 	Why?! 
BRINN 	<crying> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
GABRIEL 	Don't fucking touch me. 
BRINN 	I promise you, I just thought it was for the money. But I didn't know that I would meet you. 
GABRIEL 	I loved you. You were my fucking wife. Do you even know who I am? 
GABRIEL 	Shit! Window. Window, window, window. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Hey! 
BRINN 	<gasps> 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Brinn is innocent. It's your call, Gabriel. 
BRINN 	Jesus. What the fuck took you so long? 
DEPUTY TRUVIO 	We took a nice, scenic river drive. He's good. but he ain't better than us. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	I've been waiting all day to do that. What happened to you, soldier?  
DOCTOR 	Let Reese know he's awake. 
GABRIEL 	What happened? 
DOCTOR 	It's best if you just relax. You've been here before. Nothing to worry about.  
GABRIEL	<grunts> 
DOCTOR 	Stop struggling. I'm trying to help you. 
GABRIEL 	Argh...! <groaning> <breathing heavily> 
MALE VOCALIST 	<singing> We live in the time... 
GABRIEL 	No, you mother fuck. Fuck you, mother fuckin' <indistinct yelling> 
MALE VOCALIST 	<singing> ...Just let them all pretend Who they've never been before... 
DOCTOR 	If it's any comfort, know that when you wake up you won't remember any of this. 
MALE VOCALIST 	<singing> ...the end of my dreams... 
GABRIEL 	<groaning, grunting> 
DOCTOR 	Gabriel. Stay with us.  
GABRIEL 	Agh! 
DOCTOR 	<grunting> 
GABRIEL 	<grunting> 
GABRIEL 	You mother fucker. Put your hands behind your head. Interlock your fingers and turn around. Slower. Is there anyone else here? 
DR. REESE 	I'm unarmed. 
GABRIEL 	Where are we? 
DR. REESE 	This is where you were born, Gabriel. You won't get out. 
GABRIEL 	Right now I just need a reason not to kill you. 
DR. REESE 	Because you can't live without knowing the answer to the question that's burning inside you. 
GABRIEL 	Let's take a walk.  That's an awful lot of oxygen and air to run an underground facility, huh? Hold up there. Really only going to ask  one thing. Who are the Sons of Liberty? 
DOCTOR REESE 	Agh! <grunts> 
GABRIEL 	An organization of American colonists, a secret society to fight British taxation known for undertaking the Boston Tea Party in . I have a feeling that they still exist. Oh my God. I'm killing people who are fighting for real liberty, so they can keep control? Jesus fuck.  
DR. REESE 	Very good, Gabriel. 
GABRIEL 	Get up.  
GABRIEL 	Everybody get out. 
DR. REESE 	Before you go too far, I need to show you something. 
GABRIEL 	I know they're coming for me but we need to keep moving. 
DR. REESE 	You still don't know who you are. 
DR. REESE 	Initially I grew skin for burn victims. Then I started doing the research nobody would dare do... limb reanimation, brain tissue regeneration, trying to figure out how the human body works... and then learning how to duplicate it. 
GABRIEL 	So you could bring back your wife. 
DR. REESE 	She was everything to me. Then the fine people at the American Medical Association had me arrested for unsanctioned research. Sons of Liberty had the charges dropped, faked my death... and wrote me a blank check to continue my research.  Gabriel... meet Daniel. Yes, it's you. Daniel Lucas Pawney. Navy Seal. Noted for his exceptional sharp-shooting skills, black ops in Iraq, Kuwait, Colombia. First, do no harm. That was my goal. 
DANIEL PAWNEY	...we cleared every room. And there were dozens of them.  But they were all just mothers, trying to protect their fucking kids.  
SHERRIFF HODGE  	Cut the camera. Get a grip, boy. Come on. Sit up. You're my bitch now.  
DANIEL 	No, I'm not your bitch now. Hey, I volunteered for this shit.  
SHERIFF HODGE  	Welcome to the program, Gabriel. Sedate him. 
GABRIEL 	I'll fucking kill him! Oh my God! Ah! 
DR. REESE 	Daniel Pawney was the best assassin the American military ever had.  
GABRIEL 	You erased my fuckin' memory? Programmed me like a fuckin' machine? Triggered me, I can kill on command now. Wow. That's fuckin' great! Fuckin' great! Jesus. Who the hell's Hodge? 
DR. REESE 	Your commanding office, before he was recruited by SOL. 
GABRIEL 	Brinn? 
DR. REESE 	Her job was to be an emotional anchor for the incarnations of Gabriel. 
GABRIEL 	Are there others? 
DR. REESE 	We call them shadows. But, yes, they are clones. 
DR. REESE 	Thirteen shadows,  elimination targets.  
GABRIEL 	But not yet perfected. Which is why you had to create a false life in between missions. To keep the shadows from going mad, right? 
DR. REESE 	We had to reanimate immediately on the death of the previous. I had no idea that the memory threads would jump from clone to clone like twins. Really, I didn't.  But, you see, this is a pilot program. My ultimate goal is to eliminate human soldiers. I'm sorry, Gabriel. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Go around back.  <indistinct PA chatter> 
SHERIFF HODGE 	I see Reese showed you your old self on the monitor. But, Gabriel, you're not Daniel. There's more of you. The dream of freedom, it's over. The world's got too many people now.  Too few resources.  You're a damn good shot. How many rounds you got left? Twelve... maybe fifteen? 
GABRIEL	Enough. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	The elevators are locked. There's  feet of earth between you and the sun. What the fuck do you care about the rest of anything anyhow? 
GABRIEL 	I'm done being your puppet. The last person I'm gonna kill is you, sir. 
GABRIEL	<panting> 
GABRIEL 	What... what are you doing here? <groans> 
MAN 	...please cease operations and leave the building utilizing the nearest exit... 
TRUVIO 	I can handle it, sir. 
GABRIEL 	<grunting> 
DR. REESE 	Take Gabriel alive! 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Once an animal escapes, it'll never go domestic again. 
DR. REESE 	I've spent years of research on that boy! I'm not allowing you-- 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Are you the hunter or the scientist here?! Now get back to the surface!  
MAN 	...please cease operations and leave the building utilizing the nearest exit... 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Open this gate, you cunt! 
GABRIEL 	<moaning> 
BRINN 	Come on, babe. We've gotta move. Gabe, come. Come on, we have to move.  
GABRIEL 	No... 
BRINN  	Come on.  
GABRIEL 	I can't. I can't 
BRINN 	Please. The gate is not going to hold them... it's not going to hold them. <crying> 
GABRIEL 	Look at me. I need you to do something for me, can you? I need you to break him out. Okay? When one dies, the other one is activated.  
BRINN 	Stay with me.  
GABRIEL 	Look at up. I fuckin' love you. 
BRINN 	<crying> 
GABRIEL 	I wish it was different.  
BRINN 	Stay with me. Stay with me. Oh my God. Oh, God.  
MASTERSON 	Dr. Reese. 
DR. REESE 	Everything's gone to hell.  
MASTERSON 	I suspected.  And Hodge? 	
DR. REESE 	No one's getting out of there. 
MASTERSON 	You did what you could. 
BRINN 	Come on. Gabe. Gabe? Gabe! Come on. Come on. One, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...  
BRINN 	Oh, come on! Come on!  <panicked muttering> Come on! Come on! Oh, my God. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	You think I don't know every twitch you're gonna throw? Remeber -yearold Malikah, killed in Iraq? Huh? I picked up that pipe. She's screamed, "What do you  want? Want me to tell you you can rape me?" And I said, "We take what we want. What we don't want, we kill." Now, I'm gettin' tired of this cat-and-mouse bullshit.

SHERRIFF HODGE 	<grunting> 
BRINN 	No! 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Relax. Not gonna kill the Brinn.   He is. On your feet, soldier. 
BRINN	Gabriel... 
SHERIFF HODGE 	He couldn't deal. PTSD.  
BRINN  	Gabriel. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Nightmares. That's my only regret...  
BRINN 	Gabriel. Remember who you are. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	That I didn't kill him sooner.  
BRINN 	Gabriel. Gabe. Gabe.  
SHERIFF HODGE 	Pick up that gun. 
BRINN 	No! No, Gabriel. It's me, Brinn.  
SHERIFF HODGE 	Go ahead and pick it up. 
BRINN 	Gabriel, don't do it. Gabe, please, remember who you are.  Please, Gabriel. It's me, Brinn. Please remember who you are. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Aim... 
BRINN 	You're not a killer. You're not a killer! Gabriel. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Go ahead.  
BRINN 	Oh, no... 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Aim. 
BRINN 	Oh no, Gabriel, please. Please, please, don't. Please. 
SHERIFF  HODGE 	Go ahead, fire! 
BRINN 	Gabriel, no, please. Please. 
SHERIFF HODGE 	Shoot her! Fire! 
BRINN 	Gabriel!  
BRINN 	Gabe.  Gabriel. Gabriel, oh my God.  <indistinct PA chatter> 
BRINN 	Shit. Oh, shit, there's smoke. 
GABRIEL 	Shit. There's gas everywhere. 
BRINN 	We gotta go.  
GABRIEL 	I need clothes. 
BRINN 	Shit! It's not working.  
MAN 	...or fire exit stairways. Do not use the elevators. Repeat, do not use elevators... 
BRINN 	<coughing> 
GABRIEL 	All right, so listen. Listen to me. Hold on, listen. You need to hang onto really tight, okay? And then when you get to the top and-- 
BRINN 	No. No. You're coming with me.  
GABRIEL 	I can't. 
BRINN 	No, you have to.  Please. Please, I came back for you, Gabriel. Please come back with me.  
GABRIEL 	No, no, no, babe. I'm not afraid-- 
BRINN 	I'm not leaving you down here! 
GABRIEL 	You have to. 
BRINN 	No. 
GABRIEL 	I'm a killer and this is where-- 
BRINN 	No, you're not a killer.  You're number . You're my lucky number. You're not a killer. You can come with me. We'll start a new life together. Please.  
GABRIEL 	I can't. This is it. 
BRINN 	Oh my... <crying> 
GABRIEL 	It's alright. 
BRINN 	No... 
GABRIEL 	Look, look, look, look, you have to tell everyone what they did. You have to make it. I'm so fucking happy you came back for me, but you need to go. You need to go right now, okay? Okay? 
BRINN 	Yeah. 
GABRIEL 	Hang on, please. 
BRINN 	Okay. 
GABRIEL 	<coughing>
