JOEL FLANAGAN	Good morning, babe.

LAUREN	Wow.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yeah, gonna ramp things up. Iron Man is in three months.

LAUREN	You look like an eight-year-old boy, going from hobby to hobby. I wish you'd focus your attention on something else. Like your career. Joel, gross! Where is the coffee? Where is my coffee maker? Ew!

JOEL FLANAGAN	That's not good for you. And you're way too [inaudible] when you're on it.

LAUREN	What? That's when I don't have my coffee!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Besides, it clashes with the kitchen. It's an esthetics thing.

SOPHIA TORRES	Breakfast! I'm starving!

JAVIERA TORRES	Did you study your spelling? Albuquerque.

SOPHIA TORRES	A-L-B-U... cookie? Come on, mom! You're not getting any younger! That's what abuelita says.

JAVIERA TORRES	Yeah, well, abuelita is crazy. There you go! Ok, now try it. See, my daughter might not know how to spell, but she sure has good taste. Remember how you used to not like sweet potatoes? And kale? And beets?

SOPHIA TORRES	Come on, mommy!

JAVIERA TORRES	Hold on! You like it, right? You do like it.

SOPHIA TORRES	I love it.

JAVIERA TORRES	See? La comida es amor, chiquita.

LAUREN	What are you getting from all this juicing and training?

JOEL FLANAGAN	I don't know. Purpose? Food is fuel.

LAUREN	So is caffeine.

ANNOUNCER	We've got big things cooking here at Tortilla Hut. And whoever said size doesn't matter, obviously never tried our beefy, beany burrito. Tortilla Hut, where everything is bigger and better.

GONZALO	Babe, did you see that? Sorry, boss. It's just that little guy cracks me up.

DONA	I hate to say it, but my kids eat there too. I mean, where else can you get five tacos for $0.99?

JAVIERA TORRES	Nowhere. And that should be the point. You want quality, you need to pay for it.

JAVIERA TORRES	Ándale, a trabajar. Better. Where are we with the crema de chile poblano?

DONA	We can't make crema de chile poblano with no chiles.

JAVIERA TORRES	Chin, ¡se me olvido!

GONZALO	Are you sure you don't need an extra hand in your chile field? Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

JAVIERA TORRES	If anyone asks, I went to town for supplies, ok? Turn it off, Gonzalo.

GONZALO	Ok.

JAVIERA TORRES	Turn it off, I can hear it!

AARON WESTON	Well, personally, I think we should make TH more hip, appeal to the Millennials. Yeah, no, I call it TH. Do you like that?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Having phone sex with my dad again?

AARON WESTON	You know, Mr. Flanagan, your son actually just walked in. Yeah, no, here he is.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey, dad. Yeah! Aha, aha. You know... yes, speaking of what I should be doing with my life, I really should get back to work, because there's a new product meeting. They just pushed to 10 a.m. Yeah, Aaron just told me. Yeah, I can't wait to go. Yeah, no, it's gonna be the best part of my day. Ok, love you, bye. Thanks, Aaron.

BRIAN	Hey, buddy. He'll be late for the product meeting. Oh...

AARON WESTON	Yeah. You know I only took this assistant gig because I thought he'd hardly be here and I'd have a shot at a promotion.

BRIAN	I heard the family is putting pressure on him, but I'm sure he's gonna continue to do that bare minimum that he does, so...

AARON WESTON	Yeah, but what if he starts to actually... you know, work?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Give me your jacket, come on.

MAN	Seriously?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Do it, come on.

MAN	You're kidding me!

JOEL FLANAGAN	I'll bring it back.

MAN	What was that?

BRIAN	I wouldn't worry about that.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Good morning, everyone. Oh! Look at who showed up.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Don't get too excited, sis. I just didn't want to talk to our father.

STACEY FLANAGAN	So, I'm sure everyone has seen the headlines.

JOEL FLANAGAN	We have? Oh, dad's not gonna like that!

STACEY FLANAGAN	No. We have to face the facts. Tastes are evolving. Our customers want artisanal food and authentic experience. Sophistication has come to Small Town, America. And we need to evolve right alongside. So, that only means one thing for Tortilla Hut: menu diversity. We have been coasting for far too long, we need to get out there in the field, and see what's cooking. So Brian, I need you to take the East Coast.

BRIAN	Yep.

STACEY FLANAGAN	And Megan, there's some great stuff happening in Chicago and in the Northwest. And Joel, I spoke to father about this, and he wants you to handle the Southwest.

JOEL FLANAGAN	No problemo.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Which means you will be travelling to the Southwest and handling all research and development. I want you slumming it. In every hole in the wall, every hidden gem, sampling as much of the regional food as it takes, until we find our next big product.

JOEL FLANAGAN	What? No way! That's like... work. That's like, real work. Send her!

STACEY FLANAGAN	Gina is on maternity leave starting next week, so...

JOEL FLANAGAN	I'm training for a triathlon, that's like having a baby, except it's actually good for you.

BRIAN	Stacey, why don't you let me take over the territory? I mean, it's a very viable region, and, "también, yo hablo mucho de español."

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yeah, let him do it. Let this guy...

BRIAN	Brian.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Whatever.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Joel, I want you to handle this. And I think that grandpop would have wanted you to get back to your roots.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Roots? What roots? I'm from Laguna Niguel. I'm eating clean right now. I can't eat junk.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Well, that's good, because I want you to focus on New Mexican cuisine.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I can't each cheese! I can't eat fats, I can't even eat good fats. I don't remember the last time I had an avocado. And Let's face it: I hate Mexican food. And that's not my fault, because I have a Jewish stomach.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Which is odd, because we're Irish.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Never said it made sense.

STACEY FLANAGAN	All right, any questions?

JAVIERA TORRES	Why aren't you in school?

SOPHIA TORRES	We had a half day, remember?

JAVIERA TORRES	Right.

SOPHIA TORRES	You know, I could help if you would let me.

JAVIERA TORRES	You can't help roast the chiles, chiquita.

SOPHIA TORRES	What's the big deal? They're just chiles!

JAVIERA TORRES	Just chiles?

SOPHIA TORRES	Yeah.

JAVIERA TORRES	Maybe it's time you learn about your legacy. Ok. Your legacy. A legacy is something special that's in your family. It's a part of you, and not everyone has it.

SOPHIA TORRES	So it's only special to us?

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh, yeah. This is our family secret. Ok? You can't tell anyone.

SOPHIA TORRES	I pinky swear.

JAVIERA TORRES	Pinky swear? I'm trusting you. All right. So, it goes like this. A long, long time ago, your great-great-great-grandfather made a bet. With a very wise man. His name was Fabian Garcia. And he would become known as the inventor of the New Mexico green chile.

SOPHIA TORRES	Cool.

JAVIERA TORRES	But at the time, Mr. Garcia was just a penniless farmer. He had no money to give.

SOPHIA TORRES	That's not right.

JAVIERA TORRES	But he had something better, chiquita. He had seeds. These chile seeds have been passed on through the generations. And one day, they will pass on to you.

SOPHIA TORRES	Is this why your cooking is so good?

JAVIERA TORRES	Hey!

JOEL FLANAGAN	You totally ambushed me back there!

STACEY FLANAGAN	All right, all right. Just sit down. It's time to get serious, Joel.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Look at me. I am serious. About not going to Arizona or New Mexico? Wherever you told me to go. What do I look like? I'm not a Southwestern guy. And I'm busy! I've got work. My law practice?

STACEY FLANAGAN	Occasional client who is one of daddy's golfing buddies does not a lawyer make.

JOEL FLANAGAN	It's only one of them.

STACEY FLANAGAN	What do you wanna do with your life? The lease on all your toys and lifestyle is going to run out if you don't make a smart choice. And you know of the terms of the estate. Why don't you just commit to a year of Tortilla Hut? What is stopping you? You said that grandpa was your hero. Well, he went to work, came back, and started a $500 million enterprise. Doesn't that mean anything to you?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Let's be honest, sis. It's just junk food.

STACEY FLANAGAN	It's the family business. And in my book, that's not junk.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Oh, good! You already packed. So, you got my text after all, I mean... What's going on?

LAUREN	I'm enjoying my coffee.

JOEL FLANAGAN	You know, that's really not good for you.

LAUREN	Oh, I know, Joel. And I'm done.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Done? What do you mean done? You're coming with me to New Mexico!

LAUREN	You're gonna have to do this one on your own. You know, not everything revolves around you, Joel. You know, for the last two years, we've done everything. Everything that you've wanted. We've gone on dates with your friends, and you've told me what to wear, and what to drink...

JOEL FLANAGAN	Because you asked! 

LAUREN	And now you're obsessed with trying to be Iron Man.

JOEL FLANAGAN	No, I'm trying to do Iron Man!

LAUREN	Have you ever, ever, thought about what I wanted?

JOEL FLANAGAN	What do you want, Lauren?

LAUREN	I want... someone who can make me laugh.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I never said I was a freaking comedian.

LAUREN	You know what I mean.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I'm funny.

CORDELIA TORRES	Ay, I'm not getting any younger! ,I'll be right with you, ok? Is it good? Yes? There we go!

KEVIN LANDERS	Cordelia! Always a sight for sore eyes. Hey, doesn't the new sign look great?

CORDELIA TORRES	Preciosa.

KEVIN LANDERS	Hey, did Javiera tell you the new tour just sold out?

CORDELIA TORRES	Really?

KEVIN LANDERS	Yeah!

CORDELIA TORRES	Well, that's very good.

KEVIN LANDERS	Your daughter is becoming quite the little rockstar. Just like her old lady. Where is my little pinto bean?

CORDELIA TORRES	Oh, Lord. Let him get run over by a truck. Ok, maybe not. Maybe a tractor. He could survive the truck, right? Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Babe, it's me. It went straight to voicemail. In that way where you have the choice whether to take the call or not. Anyway, I was thinking about what you were saying about how you think everything revolves around me. But remember when we went down to San Diego for that frisbee golf competition and you left early because your mom got sick and went to the hospital and I won that night? And I never made it a big deal. I was really disappointed, but I didn't bring it up. And we both know people can live without their appendix! Actually, that's probably not a good example. Listen, I want...

MACHINE	The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Good bye!

KEVIN LANDERS	Javi, nobody makes chile sauce like you have. No one! You know what? This is just the beginning. I mean, with the success of the cafe, we can look towards a real restaurant in Santa Fe.

JAVIERA TORRES	I've been there, done that.

KEVIN LANDERS	Yeah, but that was Albuquerque. You know? I'm talking about something big here, right? We're building a brand! I see a cooking show and a whole line of products starting with your signature dish.

JAVIERA TORRES	I'm still getting used to the new sign. Don't you think it's a bit much?

KEVIN LANDERS	Come on, you gotta shake things up a little bit, baby!

JAVIERA TORRES	No, I like things the way they are.

KEVIN LANDERS	Static?

JAVIERA TORRES	Timeless.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Passing through, I'm wondering if there's a good place to grab a bite to eat.

MECHANIC	Sure, there's a Tortilla Hut just down the road. But if you're looking for a real gem, go down the road about five miles and make a right at the first four-way stop. You can't miss it.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Thank you so much.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Oh, Joel. That's like discovering the hamburger. Green chile is practically the state dish.

JOEL FLANAGAN	What are you talking about, Stacey? It's freaking fantastic! It's got green chile, pinto beans, and chicken! It's not even bad for you. Beans give you fiber, chicken is protein, and green chile is a vegetable. Done!

STACEY FLANAGAN	And how would we package it? You're not thinking.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Do you really think our consumer base is concerned with your authenticity obsession?

HELEN	Hey, don't fill up on junk food!

JOEL FLANAGAN	The only people who order tacos from a drive-through window are stoners and big, fat... I mean, somewhat slightly obese people, who I'm sure are lovely people on the inside. This is a lot harder than it looks, ok? It's not exactly written on a sign where to find the best food in New Mexico. Let me call you right back.

KEVIN LANDERS	See, we've got a whole variety of different types of peppers. They come in all different shapes, sizes, colors. But this one, right here, the New Mexico green chile, that's what we're roasting right here. Isn't that smell amazing? You're gonna see everything that you could possibly imagine from the chile family in New Mexico. But it's really the green chile that is the star. This is what has become the local favorite. Save your appetite for Javiera's, cooking up her signature dish! All right, here we go. We've got a real treat here, huh?

KEVIN LANDERS	I told you it was worth the wait, right? Enjoy! Hey, why don't you guys try taking small bites, really savour this food.

HANK	I'm tasting pork and something else.

HELEN	Apples. Oh my God, apples!

HANK	Perfect harmony of the sweet and the savory.

HELEN	Just like life.

HANK	And who knew garlic soup actually tastes awesome? You got avocado? Perfect match.

CORDELIA TORRES	Sí, sí, los gringos, los gringos llegaron. I've never seen such fancy watches and purses.

ERMENDA	Let's hope they spend some money in town. I'm coming over.

CORDELIA TORRES	Ok. Hello, young man!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hi!

CORDELIA TORRES	Hi. Why aren't you with the group? You look triste. Sad.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I do?

CORDELIA TORRES	Yes. Muy triste. Oh, why? Why are you so triste? I can feel your energy.

JOEL FLANAGAN	My girlfriend just broke up with me. We were pretty serious.

ERMENDA	Oh, that's terrible!

CORDELIA TORRES	Terrible. Such a good looking young man, huh?

ERMENDA	Sí.

CORDELIA TORRES	Yes. And look, great physique. Yes. And nice clothes. You know what, nice clothes means nice job. Yes. Pero triste. Why? Why did she leave you?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Well, she... claimed I didn't make her laugh.

CORDELIA TORRES	No?

JOEL FLANAGAN	It's crazy, right? I mean, to leave someone, for this ridiculous reason that's untrue?

CORDELIA TORRES	Come. Let's have some lunch. Forget your troubles with some good food.

JOEL FLANAGAN	That's great.

CORDELIA TORRES	Come on!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Ok.

CORDELIA TORRES	Órale, órale. See you later.

GONZALO	I'm sorry, are you with the tour?

CORDELIA TORRES	Gonzalo, Gonzalo, have pity on him. His fiancee... lo abandonó.

GONZALO	Sorry, bro. What do you want me to do? The orders are even, and you know Javiera.

HANK	What's the matter?

HELEN	I just lost my appetite.

CORDELIA TORRES	What's wrong? Is there anything wrong?

HANK	Hey, pal! This is a private party. If he stays, we go.

JAVIERA TORRES	What am I hearing?

CORDELIA TORRES	What's going on here? They don't seem to like you very much.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I don't...

JAVIERA TORRES	Mamá. What's going on? No one is eating. I never make the wrong amount.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yeah, well, these things happen every day.

JAVIERA TORRES	For some, but not for me.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Listen, lady. I'm just a guy who needs a meal. Maybe we could work something out?

JAVIERA TORRES	You are a really funny guy, you know that?

KEVIN LANDERS	Everyone satisfied?

HANK	This bozo followed us in here, and now he's trying to eat all of this amazing food for free.

KEVIN LANDERS	Sorry, sport. Who are you?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Don't worry about it, Mr. Mustache.

JAVIERA TORRES	What do you mean? He's not with the tour?

KEVIN LANDERS	And stay out!

GONZALO	Sorry about your lady friend, bro. Eat your feelings.

JOEL FLANAGAN	So, I just tried something pretty terrific.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Acting like a human being?

JOEL FLANAGAN	No! An empanada.

STACEY FLANAGAN	I thought you couldn't get on that tour.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I have my ways. Listen, here's the thing. There's this woman, Javiera Torres. And I think she may be the real deal. Sounds like people come from all around to try this signature dish of hers.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Haha. I smell marketing campaign. Tell me she's 80 years old, full of wrinkles and character.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Sort of.

STACEY FLANAGAN	No, coffee. Is it coffee? Do you think we can market her dish?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Listen, don't kill me, but I haven't exactly tried it yet.

JAVIERA TORRES	Hey. How did you let that jerk get in?

KEVIN LANDERS	Look at the lengths people are going to eat your food. It's starting, baby!

HELEN	Oh, Javiera, would you stay a minute? Your dish is delicious. I could eat it all the time.

HANK	You make a terrific frozen dinner.

HELEN	Could you share with us some of your culinary secrets?

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh. How do you make love?

HELEN	What?

HANK	From behind.

JAVIERA TORRES	It's sort of asking how I cook. It's personal.

STACEY FLANAGAN	There are food blogs dedicated to this woman. Joel, you have to go back!

JOEL FLANAGAN	No, I'm done. I've done my civic duty.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Ok, listen. I have a really big board meeting coming up in the next few weeks, and I need something positive to report. I really need your help here, Joel. And remember what we talked about regarding your inheritance. Joel? Joel?

AARON WESTON	Hello? Oh hey, buddy! How's New Mexico?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Oh, hey Aaron. Question for you. Why did a highway patrolman just inform me that my license has been suspended, and as a result, my car is being towed away?

AARON WESTON	Wow! That is... that's terrible. You know, I was sure... you know, that I sent in that renewal paperwork. There is no doubt about it.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Now I have to wait to get in front of the DA to talk about a temporary permit. This is all on you, pal. It's because of you, I insulted a cop, and the tow truck driver, although he deserved it. And now I can't even get a ride into town! Seriously? Gone fishin'? With an apostrophe? Not fishing, I-N-G... Outstanding.

KEVIN LANDERS	Listen, would you take a look at these for me?

JAVIERA TORRES	Contracts? How romantic!

KEVIN LANDERS	I know, baby. But it's good to have things in writing.

SOPHIA TORRES	You're gonna miss your tour bus.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Do I look like a tourist to you?

SOPHIA TORRES	You sure don't look like you belong here.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Amen, sister.

JAVIERA TORRES	Hey!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Amen.

JAVIERA TORRES	Sophia, haven't I told you not to talk to strangers?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey, I'm really not that strange.

SOPHIA TORRES	He's funny.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Thanks, Junior!

KEVIN LANDERS	Is this man bothering you, Sophie?

SOPHIA TORRES	My name is Sophia. And no, he's funny.

KEVIN LANDERS	It's not enough for you to ruin my tour, now you have to come and harass the locals too?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey, I was invited.

KEVIN LANDER	By who? Well, that doesn't count. It's my tour and I want you out of Villanueva.

JOEL FLANAGAN	You always have your man speak for you?

JAVIERA TORRES	This isn't just about Kevin's tour, but my cafe. My cooking is my life, and I won't let anyone make a mockery of it.

KEVIN LANDERS	Hey, don't look at me!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Displaced anger, huh pal?

KEVIN LANDERS	Something like that.

MAN	Gracias, Diego.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I'll have what he had, minus the flavor. You know sugar causes cancer, right? Ok.

SOPHIA TORRES	I knew it! I missed everything. Does your face hurt much? Do you think you got permanent brain damage? Like, one day, when you're 80, you'll wake up and not even know who you are?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Honestly, kid, I genuinely wish that day were today. Listen, do you know any hotels around here? Maybe like a Four Seasons or something?

SOPHIA TORRES	Oh, Ermenda rents rooms out. She owns a gift shop right across the street, with like, the chiles.

JAVIERA TORRES	Sophia, ¡vámonos!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Listen. I'm really not such a bad guy here.

JAVIERA TORRES	Listen, whoever you are, I don't know where you come from, but around here, everybody looks out for each other. So, if I were you, I'd watch it.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Mrs. Javiera? I couldn't help but notice that you were handling some legal documents from your friend.

JAVIERA TORRES	You're a lawyer?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yeah, I'm a lawyer.

JAVIERA TORRES	Figures.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I would get a professional look at those if I were you. You wouldn't wanna do anything that you would regret.

JAVIERA TORRES	Like turning around and talking to you?

SOPHIA TORRES	Good one, momma!

JOEL FLANAGAN	What a cute town. It's great.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Hey, I've been trying you for hours.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Don't start with me, sis. It's been the worst week.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Yeah, I heard about Lauren. Are you ok?

JOEL FLANAGAN	I haven't had time to process it. And I'm sure Aaron told you, my good friend, that my car has been impounded, and I have to wait to get in front of the DA, but he apparently has gone fishing! I can hear you grim, sis.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Being stuck in a town with one of the best regional chefs in New Mexico? Now, why would I want that?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Just like old times. My sister mocking me.

STACEY FLANAGAN	I'm staring at a photo of the marketing campaign we did. You were such a bad actor! That's because you made me eat the product!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hi! Hold on, just a second.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Yeah, but we had fun, didn't we?

JOEL FLANAGAN	No, as I recall, you loved it, because you were always daddy's little company girl. Oh, come on! It's charming. Didn't realize I was renting a room from the Vatican. You sure I can't pay you online?

ERMENDA	I still use Windows 97.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Are there any restaurants open? I'm starving.

ERMENDA	We only have one restaurant, Javiera's. And she's only open for lunch. Looks like you really burned that bridge, huh? You have to integrate yourself, muchacho.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Maybe I'll go buy some turquoise paint. Gonna get my suitcase. Hey! Watch it, jerk! Sorry, I didn't know it was you.

JAVIERA TORRES	You make it a habit of calling people jerks?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Well, you almost ran me over. Listen, let's start over, huh? Shall we? I'm in a bit of a bind. See, I am stuck here until the DA comes back from his fishing trip.

JAVIERA TORRES	Yes, so I heard.

JOEL FLANAGAN	And I may starve to death. How about a quid pro quo? I will look over your boyfriend's contracts, the guy with the mustache...

JAVIERA TORRES	Are you...?

JOEL FLANAGAN	And in exchange, you give me a great meal. How about that? Hey! A district attorney's fee is 200 dollars an hour, at least! I think that's a pretty good deal. Think about it!

JAVIERA TORRES	Hello?

KEVIN LANDERS	Hey! I just wanted to check in on you. I didn't get a chance to explain those contracts before I left.

JAVIERA TORRES	I'm fine. How's your eye?

KEVIN LANDERS	It's still there. Listen, if that asshole comes back...

JAVIERA TORRES	I should go. Sophia needs help with her homework.

KEVIN LANDERS	Ok. Night, baby.

JAVIERA TORRES	Good night.

CORDELIA TORRES	Hey! Flying to your man?

JAVIERA TORRES	He's not my man. All right, he's sort of like my man. You know, Kevin... Kevin is a good guy. He is fun, he's cute. And we sort of have the same goals.

CORDELIA TORRES	Sort of is not good enough for my daughter.

JAVIERA TORRES	Mama, I am a single mother living in Villanueva. Population: 846.

CORDELIA TORRES	848! Tina had babies, twins.

JAVIERA TORRES	I stand corrected. 848. My point is, sort of has become my... fantastic. I'm ok with that. More importantly, I trust Kevin. Sort of.

CORDELIA TORRES	Sort of. Who are you cooking for?

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh, please. That man is an ass.

CORDELIA TORRES	Yes, I saw his ass. And let me tell you something about it: I approve.

JAVIERA TORRES	Mama!

CORDELIA TORRES	Take it, take it! Yeah!

JAVIERA TORRES	Mamá!

SOPHIA TORRES	What did I miss? What did I miss?

JAVIERA TORRES	Nothing.

CORDELIA TORRES	Nothing.

JAVIERA TORRES	Here. Why don't you bring this to your new best friend? Ay! Sophia!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Wow, that's pretty good. It probably has a lot of sugar in it though, right?

JAVIERA TORRES	It's actually all natural. Mango, pear, ginger, with a bit of carrot to give it that unique zip. You want me to take it back?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Oh, no, no, thank you. It's... It's pretty perfect, actually. You can't get that back home. I'll tell you that.

JAVIERA TORRES	Where is that, Iceland?

JOEL FLANAGAN	No, actually. I'm from Irvine, California.

JAVIERA TORRES	Well, you probably can't get this there, either.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Dinner or breakfast?

JAVIERA TORRES	See?

JOEL FLANAGAN	You know, I was... really hoping for the house special.

JAVIERA TORRES	I only make that once a week, that's only for family and friends.

JOEL FLANAGAN	It's really good.

JAVIERA TORRES	Excuse me.

SOPHIA TORRES	You like it?

JOEL FLANAGAN	It's perfect. You wanna know a secret? I don't like Mexican food. Normally. But this is good. Are you sure it's Mexican food? Hey. So, it's a fairly basic partnership agreement. You've agreed to partner on a product line and a potential new restaurant venture.

JAVIERA TORRES	Yes, but why the fairly?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Well, I'm assuming you agreed to this, but the percentage of ownership... it's a 60-40 split. In your boyfriend's favor. I just wanted to make sure, because it seems a bit askew. It seems pretty obvious that you're the real asset here. Also, we should go over division and net profits, and equity compensation.

JAVIERA TORRES	It's fine.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Also, there's something you should know. Recipes aren't protected under copyright law. Anyone can copy a chef's recipe. And I just wanted you to be aware of that.

JAVIERA TORRES	What are you suggesting? That Kevin would steal my dish?

JOEL FLANAGAN	No. No, no, no. From the little that I know Kevin, he seems like a real stand-up guy. And I might add, quite a catch.

JAVIERA TORRES	Is that your professional opinion?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yes.

JAVIERA TORRES	Because your counsel is no longer needed.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Thanks for... dinner.

SOPHIA TORRES	He seems sad.

JAVIERA TORRES	You don't know him, chiquita. We don't know him.

SOPHIA TORRES	How are you supposed to know somebody if you don't give them a chance?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Don't you ever go to school?

SOPHIA TORRES	It's feast day!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Of course it is. What's that?

SOPHIA TORRES	Feast day of Saint Isidre. Patron saint of followers. We all pray for a good harvest.

JOEL FLANAGAN	And then what do you do?

SOPHIA TORRES	We eat!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Of course you do.

SOPHIA TORRES	Why do you run so much?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Because it's good for you. Besides, I'm training for Iron Man.

SOPHIA TORRES	You know Iron Man?

JOEL FLANAGAN	You're a pretty little kid, huh?

SOPHIA TORRES	Well, I'm a kid, and maybe you're just not used to that.

JOEL FLANAGAN	True. I'm not used to it at all.

SOPHIA TORRES	Can I ask you a question?

JOEL FLANAGAN	That was a question. But yes, you can.

SOPHIA TORRES	Why do you hit Kevin?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Self-defense.

SOPHIA TORRES	Why did Kevin hit you?

JOEL FLANAGAN	You'd have to ask him that.

SOPHIA TORRES	What's the worst thing you've ever done?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Cheat on my LSATS. How about you?

SOPHIA TORRES	Call my dad and hang up on him. I just wanted to hear his voice. He lives in Albuquerque with his new wife and their brand new baby. He's my brother, but when I look at him, I just see a big blob. What's the nicest thing you've ever done?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yet to be determined.

SOPHIA TORRES	Does that mean you've never, ever done anything nice?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Means... maybe it means I haven't done anything worth mentioning yet. Call it bum luck.

SOPHIA TORRES	I call that pathetic.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Jesus.

ERMENDA	Look at that gringo eating goat!

JOEL FLANAGAN	You're kidding, right?

CORDELIA TORRES	No, Mr. Handsome. It is goat.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Who knew I liked goat? It's got this amazing smoky, earthy thing going on.

CORDELIA TORRES	That's Javiera and her chiles.

ERMENDA	The Torres family are known for their chiles. They win all the big awards.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Where do they grow these chiles? Oh, sorry. Is that a thing? I didn't know that was a thing.

CORDELIA TORRES	The key difference between a New Mexican and Mexican cuisine is the way you use your chiles. You know? It can make or break a dish.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Including your daughter's?

CORDELIA TORRES	My daughter is a very good cook.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Speaking of which, do I really have to wait a full week for this signature dish of hers? Couldn't I do something to...?

ERMENDA	Look at Mr. Charming. Don't push it. Javiera has been known to skip for weeks if she's not feeling like it.

CORDELIA TORRES	Or if she's pissed off. Yeah.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I bet she never gets pissed off.

CORDELIA TORRES	What could I do? Just tell me. He just showed up! Hija, I really don't understand you. I mean, what's your problem? He.... he... he... Es muy guapo.

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh, looks? That's all it takes for you? I think after papá you'd learn your lesson!

CORDELIA TORRES	Yes, I had eight hellish years with your papá. But the sex was fantástico.

JAVIERA TORRES	And that made up for it?

CORDELIA TORRES	Well, let me tell you something. You know what, it did not hurt. Oh, and when it hurt, it hurt so good.

JAVIERA TORRES	¡Qué pervertida eres, mamá! Dale, dale, dale, dale. ¡Ay!

JOEL FLANAGAN	You know, I never thought I was religious, but I like this church.

SOPHIA TORRES	So, where's the middle?

MAN	The universe? It's too big to tell.

JAVIERA TORRES	Just think. Before Galileo came along, people thought the Earth was in the middle.

SOPHIA TORRES	Really?

JAVIERA TORRES	Uh-huh. We all thought that all the stars and the planets revolved around us.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Is it true? Are we out of beer?

JAVIERA TORRES	Galileo proved that we're just a part of it all.

SOPHIA TORRES	Huh, that's...

JOEL FLANAGAN	Sucks. Let's face it, Galileo and his stupid little telescope are total downers.

MAN	Galileo was a hero. He was a man of great integrity and honor. He went to jail for what he believed.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yeah? Well, I'm stuck in this dusty little town without a proper workout facility. So, stuff happens. Listen, it sucks... that we're not the center of the universe. It really, really sucks. Who's with me?

SOPHIA TORRES	Me! Oh, yeah.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Listen. Listen. Is there a 7/11 around here?

MAN	Tell me this guy is not our new science teacher.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Siete/once? Anyone?

JAVIERA TORRES	Hey! Didn't anyone warn you about the drinking and the altitude?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yeah. I got it with the attitude.

JAVIERA TORRES	Altitude.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey, can I get a ride?

SOPHIA TORRES	Oh.

JAVIERA TORRES	No.

SOPHIA TORRES	Sure.

JAVIERA TORRES	No. No, not in my car!

JOEL FLANAGAN	That is a sweet little lady right there.

SOPHIA TORRES	Is he drunk?

JAVIERA TORRES	Of course not.

SOPHIA TORRES	Really?

JAVIERA TORRES	Ok, maybe a little. Let this be a lesson for you.

SOPHIA TORRES	Don't drink and study astronomy.

JAVIERA TORRES	Don't drink! It turns you into a fool.

SOPHIA TORRES	But you said he was a fool when he wasn't drunk.

JAVIERA TORRES	Why do I have a daughter that questions me at every turn?

SOPHIA TORRES	Why do you say that? So how are you gonna get him home?

JAVIERA TORRES	Well, that's a good question. Hey, wake up! Wake up, you crazy man!

SOPHIA TORRES	He's not waking up. You know, just because I have a bag over my head, it doesn't mean I don't know exactly where we are. Two right turns and a stop sign, right? You forgot a sharp left. Oh! Ok, thank you, thank you. Listen, we seem to have gone off on a bad start. How about I make it up to you? You ever been in Santa Fe? Never heard of it. Ok, lame question. Well, I never have. I was just thinking...No! I'm not going on a date with you. Good, because I'm in a relationship. Oh, really? I heard you were dumped. Ok, I got dumped. And you have a boyfriend. This would just be me taking you out to a very expensive meal. Come on, my sister just e-mailed me about this place in Santa Fe. It's new. I get my own culinary tour and you... would get to check out the competition firsthand. I wrote, "Stay in the truck!" Can't you read?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Don't shout! My head is killing me. Am I dead? Is this heaven?

JAVIERA TORRES	No. But this is clearly my personal hell.

JOEL FLANAGAN	This is your family secret chile field. Isn't it?

JAVIERA TORRES	What do you know about my chile field?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Nothing. Look, you're the one who dragged me here, ok?

JAVIERA TORRES	I tried to get you out of my truck. I can't believe this. Only my family knows about this place.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anyone. Besides, I couldn't. I have no idea where the hell we are.

JAVIERA TORRES	Wait. What are you doing?

JOEL FLANAGAN	No, no, no. My grandfather had a farm and I was a vegetarian for years, it's fine.

JAVIERA TORRES	Uh-uh.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Wow, that's good!

JAVIERA TORRES	No eating the product. You said your... your grandfather was a farmer?

JOEL FLANAGAN	He was an entrepreneur of sorts, but what I remember most about him was how much he loved nature. He always told me not to overcomplicate things, so the best ideas are often the most simples. It's kind of his motto.

JAVIERA TORRES	It's like cooking. Sometimes the most complex dishes can be... the most simple. You can't hide behind your ingredients.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Exactly! I think. Must be nice to have a passion for something.

JAVIERA TORRES	You don't like being a lawyer?

JOEL FLANAGAN	I wouldn't say it's a calling, like your cooking.

JAVIERA TORRES	I wouldn't say my cooking is a calling as much as it's... an instinct.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Instinct?

JAVIERA TORRES	Uh-huh.

JOEL FLANAGAN	It sure is beautiful out here.

JAVIERA TORRES	It's like we're in the center of the universe, huh? Galileo.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Cute.

JAVIERA TORRES	Uh-huh. Real cute.

JOEL FLANAGAN	You know, just because I have a bag over my head, it doesn't mean I don't know exactly where we are. Two right turns and a stop sign, right?

JAVIERA TORRES	You forgot a sharp left.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Oh! Ok, thank you, thank you. Listen, we seem to have gone off on a bad start. How about I make it up to you? You ever been in Santa Fe?

JAVIERA TORRES	Never heard of it.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Ok, lame question. Well, I never have. I was just thinking...

JAVIERA TORRES	No! I'm not going on a date with you.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Good, because I'm in a relationship.

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh, really? I heard you were dumped.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Ok, I got dumped. And you have a boyfriend. This would just be me taking you out to a very expensive meal. Come on, my sister just e-mailed me about this place in Santa Fe. It's new. I get my own culinary tour and you... would get to check out the competition firsthand.

SOPHIA TORRES	What are you getting all dressed up for?

JAVIERA TORRES	Just going to Santa Fe.

SOPHIA TORRES	Isn't Kevin in Tulsa?

CORDELIA TORRES	Sophia, will you please go to the cafe and bring us some eggs for tonight?

SOPHIA TORRES	I know what you're doing.

CORDELIA TORRES	Ándale. Ándale. Ándale, ándale.

JAVIERA TORRES	Te amo, chiquita. Ok.

CORDELIA TORRES	No, this one. Keep this one.

JAVIERA TORRES	I just... I feel like it's so much skin.

CORDELIA TORRES	Are you a nun? Ok.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hold on, Stacey. Hello? I can't believe you're making me do this.

STACEY FLANAGAN	You are the one who reported how great her chiles were.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I don't think you and your food scientists are gonna be able to reverse engineer this one, sis.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Yeah? Well, you just... let me worry about that, ok? I just need one sample, Joel. Just one.

SOPHIA TORRES	Hello? Hello? Galileo!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Great! You're calling me that now?

SOPHIA TORRES	Everybody calls you that now. So, what are you doing here?

JOEL FLANAGAN	I... Just hungry.

SOPHIA TORRES	Wait. I thought you were going to have dinner with my mom. She got all dressed up for you and everything. That's not fair! I knew you first.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I think you're gonna have a lot of fancy dinners in your future. Hey, listen. Do me a favor? Don't tell your mom I was here. I wouldn't want her to think that I ruined my dinner.

SOPHIA TORRES	Ok. So... Here. For your dumb luck.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I think you mean bum luck?

SOPHIA TORRES	Yeah, that's what I said. I'll see you later?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Ok.

SOPHIA TORRES	Have fun with my mom!

JOEL FLANAGAN	See ya. Bye!

SOPHIA TORRES	Bye!

JAVIERA TORRES	This isn't what you think it is.

ERMENDA	I didn't say anything.

JAVIERA TORRES	Where is he? This was a bad idea.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Sorry. I...

JAVIERA TORRES	Forgot?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Definitely not. I just need a minute.

JAVIERA TORRES	Let's just get this over with, huh?

JOEL FLANAGAN	That's the spirit.

JAVIERA TORRES	Ok, I see we're gonna have to set up some ground rules here. Number one, I'm here for the meal. Everyone knows Kevin in Santa Fe, and I would like to experience dining like... like an anonymous civilian. Which is why I'm here with you and not him. Just to be clear.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Clear.

JAVIERA TORRES	Number two. There will be no post-dinner drinks. And definitely not drinks. What are you looking at?

JOEL FLANAGAN	You're not the only one who doesn't consider this a date. What makes you think you're so damn desirable anyway? Ok, ok, fine. I'm not blind, but I'm a pretty good catch myself. I mean, I'm a lawyer, I'm not ugly, I've got some dollars in the...

MAN	Hey, can you spare some change?

JAVIERA TORRES	Charitable?

JOEL FLANAGAN	A guy can't have everything.

JAVIERA TORRES	Yeah, right.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Just wouldn't be fair. Did you know oysters are high in zinc?

JAVIERA TORRES	Did you know they also raise your sperm count?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Anyway. So... tell me about you.

JAVIERA TORRES	This is not a date.

JOEL FLANAGAN	This is not a date.

JAVIERA TORRES	All right. Well, believe it or not, I used to own a fancy restaurant. A bit like this one. In Albuquerque with my ex.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Sophia's dad?

JAVIERA TORRES	Uh-huh. Turns out that saying, "Too many cooks in the kitchen"? Not such a cliché. At first, it was great, actually. Working side by side. Bradley was very proud of me and... he would brag that I could outcook him. And then the reviews started to single me out, and people started coming in for my dishes. My chile sauce. And he cheated on me. We divorced, he married her. She's the stay-at-home type. Funny. She wasn't staying at home when she was banging my husband.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Bitch.

JAVIERA TORRES	Thank you.

JOEL FLANAGAN	And now, you're with Kevin.

JAVIERA TORRES	Yeah. Uh-huh. Kevin. So, what about you? What's your sad, sad story? What's your ex like?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Well, she's attractive.

JAVIERA TORRES	Shocking. I mean like, what does she do?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Oh! Lauren's in marketing.

JAVIERA TORRES	Ok, marketing what?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Branding and... stuff like that.

JAVIERA TORRES	You have no idea what she does for a living.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Our relationship wasn't about that. She was very supportive.

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh, I bet. Of you. Don't you think it's important for two people to be supportive of one another?

WAITRESS	Would you like to hear about our specials?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Please! And I will be very supportive of your decision.

WAITRESS	First, we have a lovely pollo and pipian rojo.

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh, nice! That's chicken in red sauce with pumpking seeds. I make that from time to time.

WAITRESS	We're also featuring tonight a new dish, called Asado de puerco verde. It's a split-roasted pork chop, stuffed with...

JAVIERA TORRES	Ground pork in pasote and served with chile verde sickle?

WAITRESS	Well, I guess. Have you been here before?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Where are you going?

JAVIERA TORRES	¿Y los dueños? ¿Los dueños no se encuentran aquí?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Don't look at me, this isn't a date. Sorry. Javiera? Hey, what's wrong?

JAVIERA TORRES	I need a drink.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Man, I knew that foody couple from the tour sucked. I feel badly.

JAVIERA TORRES	Why? You didn't steal my dish.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Your cooking is so important to you. It means everything. Where did that come from?

JAVIERA TORRES	You want me to take it back?

JOEL FLANAGAN	No way.

JAVIERA TORRES	What's in your pocket? Is that Sophia's?

JOEL FLANAGAN	She lent it to me. She thought I could use the luck.

JAVIERA TORRES	It's working, right?

KEVIN LANDERS	Well, well, well. I can't believe you. And with this guy? Is this about our partnership agreement? Are you trying to sabotage our business?

JAVIERA TORRES	Is that what this is to you? A business agreement?

KEVIN LANDERS	You know we're more than that.

WOMAN	I counted to 10.

KEVIN LANDERS	I said, wait 10 minutes.

JAVIERA TORRES	I thought you were working in Tulsa. Alone.

WOMAN	What's her problem? You think she was your... girl or... you dick.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Well, well, well.

JAVIERA TORRES	Enough. No more hitting.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Are you ok? I feel horrible.

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh, no. It's my fault. I got in the way. Ow. Getting punched in the face really hurts.

JOEL FLANAGAN	It's the first time anyone, much less a girl...

JAVIERA TORRES	Woman!

JOEL FLANAGAN	A woman. A woman, took a punch for me. I think that's... I think the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.

JAVIERA TORRES	I think that's the nicest thing I've ever done for anyone. You know, I... I'm thinking about something I haven't done with anyone in years.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Yeah?  I'm totally up for anything.

JAVIERA TORRES	Really? You wanna cook together? So, let's make this fun, huh? Go pick like, ten random ingredients.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Really? Is that gonna be good? Ok.

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh!

JOEL FLANAGAN	What do you think? Look now.

JAVIERA TORRES	You're going easy on me. You are a very smart man. Nice.

JOEL FLANAGAN	That's good. Oh, so spicy! Control the bowl.

JAVIERA TORRES	Stop!

JOEL FLANAGAN	I got it, I got it. This is getting a little weird. But I like it. I can't dance or cook.

CORDELIA TORRES	What the hell?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Corn Flakes never looked so good.

ERMENDA	Sí?

CORDELIA TORRES	They're cooking.

ERMENDA	No!

CORDELIA TORRES	Sí. He might be the one! ¡Salud!

JOEL FLANAGAN	It looks too good to eat.

JAVIERA TORRES	And you... look too good to be true. Careful.

BRIAN	No, no, it's a great idea. The mix is the... the dessert with the entree, and that's why I think it's a true winner.

STACEY FLANAGAN	A churro stuffed with a beefy beanie burrito? Come on, Brian. I sent you out for a new product.

BRIAN	No, no, no, no, no. It's a good idea. It's a Humami thing. It's the salts with the sweets.

AARON WESTON	Yummy.

BRIAN	Yeah. Oh, thanks, dude.

STACEY FLANAGAN	All right. You guys aren't giving me anything. Don't tell me I have to rely on Joel. Oh, speaking of which, did the chile sample come in?

AARON WESTON	No. You know a way to turn things around? A new marketing campaign.

BRIAN	Yeah. Good idea, genius. We just ran a bunch of new spots.

AARON WESTON	And we saw no bump in sales. What about running old spots? Retro is in, and most importantly, it's cheap.

STACEY FLANAGAN	You know what? I like that. I like it a lot.

JOEL FLANAGAN	So good! Hello? You've reached Joel. Gotcha! It's my assistant.

JAVIERA TORRES	Oh. Well, maybe it's important. Do you have any open cases?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Open cases? You watch a lot of TV.

JAVIERA TORRES	I have a PhD in TV law, yes, thank you very much. Today is the big day, huh? You get to finally get your car back.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I hope he caught a lot of fish.

JAVIERA TORRES	And I'm making my signature dish. I thought you'd be a little more enthused about it.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I am, for you. And I've been waiting forever for this dish.

JAVIERA TORRES	Yeah, you have. Well... you know, just because you get your car back, doesn't mean you have to leave.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Who says I'm leaving?

JAVIERA TORRES	Who says you're not?

JOEL FLANAGAN	I do.

AARON WESTON	Dude! Hey.

JOEL FLANAGAN	What are you doing here?

STACEY FLANAGAN	Thanks for returning my calls!

JAVIERA TORRES	Joel?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Javiera. This is...

STACEY FLANAGAN	Oh, I'm Stacey. Joel's sister. And this is Aaron, a colleague.

JAVIERA TORRES	It's very nice to meet you, both of you. I'm Javiera, Joel's... I mean... So? What brings you two here?

STACEY FLANAGAN	Business.

JAVIERA TORRES	Business? In Villanueva? There's not much here.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Oh, I don't know, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

JAVIERA TORRES	Well, I'm so happy to meet you. Today is a good day, too. I'm making my specialty.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Oh! I had a feeling today was gonna be a good day.

JAVIERA TORRES	Excuse me. I have to return to the kitchen.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Of course, go!

JOEL FLANAGAN	I need to talk to you. Alone.

STACEY FLANAGAN	You had a very specific task. And instead, I find you here rebounding with this woman?

JOEL FLANAGAN	It is not a rebound!

STACEY FLANAGAN	Oh, I take it that's Javiera's daughter. So, this is what you've been up to. Playing house?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Listen. She doesn't know who I am. She knows that I'm a lawyer, but she doesn't know the rest. Please... Please let me tell her. Give me that, at least.

STACEY FLANAGAN	All right. But I advise you to come back to reality and quickly. Before someone gets hurt. Like that adorable little girl over there.

CORDELIA TORRES	So, his sister is in town doing business here?

JAVIERA TORRES	Maybe she's working in Santa Fe, I don't know, she didn't really say.

DONA	Maybe he's thinking about moving here? And she came to check you out.

JAVIERA TORRES	Stop it with the jinxing! Mamá!

CORDELIA TORRES	Right.

DONA	It's that game! He's been distracted all day.

JAVIERA TORRES	I'm gonna start charging you for this, ok? It's ok, you can keep the TV on. I am having a great day.

DONA	Oh, a woman in love.

GONZALO	That's all it took? Damn!

STACEY FLANAGAN	So good!

CORDELIA TORRES	I'm glad you like it. So, my daughter tells me that you're doing business here.

STACEY FLANAGAN	My company is looking to expand into the area.

CORDELIA TORRES	Maybe we'll get to see you more often. We've gotten quite used to Galileo.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Galileo?

CORDELIA TORRES	Yeah, sorry. That's the town's nickname for your brother. He thinks that the world revolves around him, doesn't he?

STACEY FLANAGAN	I'm really starting to love this town. So, tell me more about the signature dish of your daughter's. What's it called?

CORDELIA TORRES	It's called, "Amanecer chile verde de Javiera."

STACEY FLANAGAN	Javiera's green chile sunrise.

CORDELIA TORRES	¡Órale! ¿Hablas español?

STACEY FLANAGAN	Un poco.

CORDELIA TORRES	Enjoy.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Thank you. How about that for marketing?

SOPHIA TORRES	Why aren't you just sitting there?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Why do you ask so many questions? And why are you never in school?

SOPHIA TORRES	Well, my classroom got flooded and mom says that the whole entire town needs new ducks.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I think you mean aqueducts.

SOPHIA TORRES	Yeah, that's what I said. Mom said you got your car back. Does that mean you're gonna leave?

JOEL FLANAGAN	I promise you something. I won't leave here unless I'm no longer wanted.

SOPHIA TORRES	But you're wanted.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Thanks, kiddo.

SOPHIA TORRES	Wait, where are you going?

JOEL FLANAGAN	To find out if I'm wanted.

DONA	It's amazing!

JAVIERA TORRES	Perfect.

GONZALO	Oh, come on!

JAVIERA TORRES	It's ok.

ANNOUNCER	Tortilla Hut started with the love and determination of one man... who respected nature and whose motto was simplicity.

CORDELIA TORRES	Where are you going? You can't go in there. She's in the middle of service and she will kill you.

STACEY FLANAGAN	And to celebrate Tortilla Hut's anniversary...

JOEL FLANAGAN	Our famous taco combo...

GONZALO	Hey! Isn't that Joel?

JOEL FLANAGAN	is available for only $0.49.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Why are grandpa's tacos so good, Joel?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Family and love. That makes everything taste better.

ANNOUNCER	Tortilla Hut. Where everything is bigger and better.

CORDELIA TORRES	Hey, what's going on? Darling, what's going on?

JAVIERA TORRES	He's not who he says he is.

SOPHIA TORRES	You're not Joel?

JOEL FLANAGAN	No, I'm still Joel. I'm just not the man your mother thought I was.

SOPHIA TORRES	That's what you said about daddy.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Please, give me a chance to explain.

JAVIERA TORRES	For what? So you can lie to me some more? What do you want from me?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey, no! Hey, stop.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Joel, what are you doing?

JAVIERA TORRES	My dish. You wanna steal my dish?

STACEY FLANAGAN	No, we are not thieves. We have every intention of compensating you.

JAVIERA TORRES	You wanna rip me off, huh? Where does your food come from?

STACEY FLANAGAN	Tortilla Hut, of course.

JAVIERA TORRES	You know where my food comes from? Them. The lamb from my albóndigas come from Mr. Chaves. Oh, and then Mrs. Garcia. Her smoked chipotle cheddar. Her goats pasture on our hills. And she never gives them hormones! You know why? Because she respects the animals! And we can feel it, see it... taste it.

DONA	That's right, Javiera.

ERMENDA	And what about the most important part? Your family's chiles.

JAVIERA TORRES	That's right. So you and your industrial food lady with antibiotics, binders and emulsifiers, are gonna need a hell of a lot of inspiration to duplicate what we have here.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Well... we have all the inspiration we need.

AARON WESTON	And we have a team of food scientists who can duplicate your chile.

JAVIERA TORRES	That can't be real. Or legal.

JOEL FLANAGAN	They're gonna compensate you, Javiera. I'm gonna see to that.

JAVIERA TORRES	Compensated? Ay, ¡qué idiota eres! You clearly don't know me. And I obviously never knew you. Sophia!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Javiera, please. I didn't know how to tell you.

JAVIERA TORRES	Was this all a joke to you?

JOEL FLANAGAN	No, it was real. It was very real.

JAVIERA TORRES	You don't even know what that means. This is real to me. Family. And I want no part of you or your family.

LAUREN	Joel?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Lauren! Wow, it's good to see you.

LAUREN	Yeah, good to see you. So, how long have you been back?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Oh, a while now. I meant to reach out.

LAUREN	No, Joel. I don't...

JOEL FLANAGAN	To tell you I'm sorry. You deserve better.

LAUREN	Thanks. That's... thanks. That means a lot.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey, I heard you got promoted.

LAUREN	Yeah, I did. And I got engaged. Yeah.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Wow! 

LAUREN	I know!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Congratulations.

LAUREN	Yeah, crazy, right? I mean, I know it's super fast, but...

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey, when you know, you know. You know? Hey, I made you laugh!

LAUREN	That's more of a chuckle. But...

JOEL FLANAGAN	You always knew what you wanted, Lauren. I wish I was so lucky.

LAUREN	Maybe you're luckier than you think, Joel. Take care of yourself.

JOEL FLANAGAN	You too.

STACEY FLANAGAN	And I am pleased to report that we're well on our way to achieving our quarterly objective, bringing sophisticated flavors to mainstream America. So now, I'd like to introduce to you our new VP, Aaron Weston, who is going to present to you our new product report. Aaron?

AARON WESTON	Thank you, Stacey. Gentlemen. We have worked around the clock to duplicate the Southwest experience for our core consumers.

ANNOUNCER	Our team combed every corner of the Southwest to find its most authentic regional dishes. And it doesn't get more authentic than the smoky New Mexican green chile. Using cutting-edge food science, Tortilla Hut is bringing this exotic flavor from our family to yours.

AARON WESTON	Now, what we have come up with is testing through the roof.  I give you... the Sopa Bowl salad.

STACEY FLANAGAN	So, what we have done is recreate our favorite Southwestern dish, taking what works while keeping cost low.

AARON WESTON	Right. Instead of pricy lamb, we're using ground beef. Instead of designer cheese, our version is processed, but gooeylishious, as one focus group member said.

JOEL FLANAGAN	You want people to eat that?

STACEY FLANAGAN	No. We want them to devour it.

AARON WESTON	Also testing through the roof, our chili sauce packets.

STACEY WESTON	Pass those down. We're thinking that once these catch on, we'll just slide in a little upcharge.

JOEL FLANAGAN	You'll never be able to duplicate Villanueva. And I'm glad to see it.

STACEY FLANAGAN	Joel! And you'll never duplicate Tortilla Hut and what it means to you.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I don't wanna duplicate anything. I want something real. I quit.


CORDELIA TORRES	Baby? People have been asking about your sunrise dish.

JAVIERA TORRES	You know it's off the menu, mamá.

CORDELIA TORRES	It's gonna be ok, ok? You'll see.

JAVIERA TORRES	Thank you.

SOPHIA TORRES	I'll show them. I'll bring Joel back.

CORDELIA TORRES	Hola, mi chiquita.

SOPHIA TORRES	Hola, abuelita.

CORDELIA TORRES	Qué haces? ¿Estudiando el mapa?

SOPHIA TORRES	Es un mapa del tesoro.

CORDELIA TORRES	A treasure map? You are my treasure. Tú eres mi tesoro.

JAVIERA TORRES	What are you doing? Oh, you... Nice. You're getting me my own flowers?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey. Never promised you a rose garden. It's a song, it's from the 60's. The 70's I think.

JAVIERA TORRES	Why are you here?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Isn't it obvious? I came here, I biked 900 miles... for you. I love you, Javiera.

JAVIERA TORRES	You're not the first man to tell me that.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Maybe I'm the first man to ever come back. First man to apologize. What I did was wrong and selfish. And I know now. What I want at the center of my universe isn't myself, but you. You and Sophia.

JAVIERA TORRES	What do you plan to do in this... small dusty town?

JOEL FLANAGAN	I'm gonna open up a law office. I Googled, there is no lawyer for 35 miles.

JAVIERA TORRES	You? You Googled.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I Googled. Where's Sophia?

JAVIERA TORRES	Mamá, have you seen Sophia?

CORDELIA TORRES	Sí, sí. She was playing with her treasure map.

MAN	Come back here, you little thief!

JAVIERA TORRES	Sophia!

MAN	Come back, you thief!

CORDELIA TORRES	My granddaughter is not a thief!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Stop!

CORDELIA TORRES	She's a very good girl.

JAVIERA TORRES	Sophia!

JAVIERA TORRES	Sophia!.Sophia, please, stop the truck. No, no, no, no, no. God! Chiquita!

SOPHIA TORRES	Help! Somebody help! Somebody help!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Sophia!

SOPHIA TORRES	Help! Somebody help! Can anyone hear me? Help! Help! Somebody help!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Sophia! I'm coming!

SOPHIA TORRES	Galileo, hurry! Help! My backpack!

JOEL FLANAGAN	Swim towards the rocks! Sophia! Climb over to the rock. Hold on! Hold on. Let go on three, ready? One, two, three.

JAVIERA TORRES	Sophia! No, no, it's ok. It's ok, just hold on to Joel, baby. Oh my God! Ay, mi bebé. Mamita, it's ok. I love you, mommy is right here. Mommy is right here, baby.

SOPHIA TORRES	Mommy.

JAVIERA TORRES	My girl! My crazy little girl! ¿Estás loquita? What were you thinking?

SOPHIA TORRES	I wanted Joel back. Can we keep him? Please?

JAVIERA TORRES	He's not a dog, mamita.

SOPHIA TORRES	Please?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Well...

JAVIERA TORRES	Thank you. Thank you for saving my little girl's life.

JOEL FLANAGAN	No. Thank you for saving mine.

JAVIERA TORRES	What are you looking at?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Let's get out of here.

SOPHIA TORRES	We have an order for three more chili smoothies.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Already? I haven't even finished the last order yet.

JAVIERA TORRES	Hey! It was your idea to integrate yourself into the family business.

SOPHIA TORRES	Come on, daddy! I'm not getting any younger.

JOEL FLANAGAN	I almost forgot, I've got to catch the DA before he goes to his fishing lunch.

JAVIERA TORRES	You're working on a Saturday?

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey, you knew I was a lawyer when you married me. Besides, somebody's gotta fight for those bike lanes on Main Street.

JAVIERA TORRES	All right, all right. I'll finish the smoothies.

JOEL FLANAGAN	Hey! Hey, take it easy.

JAVIERA TORRES	I'm fine.

JOEL FLANAGAN	What's she feeding you, anyway?

JAVIERA TORRES	Plenty of love.
