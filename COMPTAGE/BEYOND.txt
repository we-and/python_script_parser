CHRIS	My name is Chris Norton, and I'm a documentary filmmaker. Shot my first film, if you could call it that, on my seventh birthday.

PETER 	I told you, shut up! Can you please stop?! ou're nagging!

NELL	I am not nagging, Peter!

PETER 	Yes, you are! It's always about you! Stop it! Shut up! Can you go and watch some TV, huh? Leave me alone.

CHRIS	I remember it well 'cause it was my birthday.

PETER	I said watch some TV! Hey, Nell! Come back. What the hell are you doing? Nell, come back! Ah, very nice!  Nell! Come back! Hear me, Nell? Chris, go to bed.

CHRIS	It was just a power surge. It was enough for my father to take the act of a desperate woman and turn it into another one of his obsessions. That night he became convinced that my  mother was abducted by aliens. My father died two weeks ago, never giving up on that belief, so I decided to make this film to disprove one of the greatest myths of this century, the one that destroyed my family, the alien abduction phenomenon.

LYRICS	Show me home You are Shine for me like a star Show me home

CHRIS	Meet Kyle, our grip and local guide.

KYLE	Hey, hey, how's it going?

CHRIS	How ya doing?

KYLE	Good. Kyle Blackburn.

CHRIS	Chris Norton.

KYLE	Nice to meet you.

BRENT	Yeah, nice to meet you. I'm Brent.

KYLE	Convention's over here. Bill, this is Chris Norton.

BILL	Chris. CHRIS Hey.

BILL	Bill Johnson. Nice to meet ya.

CHRIS	Yeah, great to you meet you.

CHRIS	This is Brent.

BILL 	Oh, hey there, Brent.

BILL	Welcome to the International UFO Congress. You ever been to this conference before?

CHRIS	I don't believe so.

BILL	Well, then let me show you around. You okay there, Brent? Get my good side.

CHRIS	He's just gonna be following us.

BILL	Alrighty. I built this convention from the ground up when Roswell was nothing more than a joke. Now we attract world-renowned experts, and our town thrives. We have over a hundred exhibitors this year and somewhere between, oh,  and , guests have passed through the doors. So you're a skeptic, Mr. Norton? 

CHRIS	Oh, what makes you say that?

BILL 	I can always spot a nonbeliever.

CHRIS 	Well, I am a reporter at heart,  so I like to let the evidence guide my opinion.

BILL	Well, there certainly is plenty of evidence here. I think you'll find it quite compelling.

CHRIS	Well, I sure hope so.

CHRIS 	I'm just curious about these sculptures. Which ones are the ones that allegedly abduct humans?

HICKTYN	Well, do you mind if I give a little test to you?

CHRIS	Sure.

HICKTYN 	I'm just curious.

HICKTYN	Let me have you hold this, and I just want you to tell me if you feel anything whatsoever when you hold it.

CHRIS	I feel like I'm holding a black...sculpture. Oh, whoa, my hand just started tingling.

HICKTYN	In the future, perhaps you may have an experience, but regardless of what happens, you need to be open-minded and be in your heart. I know it's hard for you to believe this stuff, but as long as you keep pushing away any possibilities, you're limiting yourself.  You don't wanna do that. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you my card. Just give me a call. You're gonna have contact.

SPEAKER	And then you try to go forward, what happens...

ADAM	It's hard to remember much, but it was a bright light, and two hours later, I was still just there, like nothing happened.

CHRIS 	Yeah, I understand that's fairly common, the lights.

ADAM 	It seemed to affect my ability to move. And...And my memories, it, uh.. did something with my memories.

CHRIS	Okay, so considering that, is it possible for you to even remember anything from the actual abduction?

ADAM	It was like a nightmare. It was cold and...That light, there was light everywhere, but not like it came from anywhere. I was strapped to a table, and they... they did things.

CHRIS	Adam...are you familiar with a phenomenon known as false memory syndrome?

ADAM	You think I made it up?

CHRIS	No, I don't think you made it up intentionally, but it is a self-defense mechanism of the mind.

ADAM	I know what I saw, okay? I remember when they took me.

ADAM	I remember it.

CHRIS	Okay.

CHRIS	Well, you said it yourself, it was like a nightmare. Maybe it was an actual nightmare.

ADAM	Just leave me alone! You're just trying to hurt me like the rest of 'em.

CHRIS	I'm not trying to hurt you.

ADAM 	No! You're just trying to hurt me just like all of them, okay?

CHRIS	Listen, you gotta be able to face the truth if you're ever gonna get free.

ADAM 	Leave me alone!

CHRIS 	Calm down.

CHRIS 	Whoa! Hey!

EMILY 	Adam, Adam.

CHRIS 	What the hell are you doing? Hey! This is my interview. Get the hell outta here.

ADAM	I know what what I saw.

EMILY	What the hell are you doing?

CHRIS	What the hell are you doing? I'm trying to help him out. He's gotta be willing to confront the truth if

EMILY 	The truth is none of your goddamn business!

CHRIS	But it's yours? It's your goddamn business?

EMILY 	Yes! This is my friend! Who are you to determine what the truth is for anyone?

CHRIS	I'm just trying to let him know, and you, that truth is not an opinion, it's a verifiable fact.

EMILY	Okay, well, then verify this: Go fuck yourself. Come on.

BILL 	Hey, get over here, damn it.

CHRIS	Now we gotta find somebody else to interview.

BILL	What the hell is going on? I'm hearing screaming all over.

CHRIS	I was doing an interview, and he starts freaking out. I'm just asking him simple questions.

BILL	Turn that off, please. I can't have any of this. I can't have it, okay? You need to pack up your stuff and get out of here right now. Let's go. Everything's okay, folks! It's all right. Tom, it's okay. You can start up again. Everything's good here. We're all good. Sorry.

CHRIS	Hey, who's that girl who just came in?

KYLE 	Emily? She's a local girl. Emily Reed.

CHRIS	Emily Reed.

CHRIS	Maybe I was too harsh. I don't know. But I felt like I at least had to explain myself to Emily. Kyle found out she organizes some community gathering just outside of town. That's what I love about documentaries. You never know where the story's gonna take you.

BRENT	Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're going live on this one.

CHRIS	You're the boss.

BRENT	Go, go, go, go.

AGNES	It's not knowing the truth that hurts the most.

CHRIS	Sorry to interrupt. We're with Emily.

BIG MIKE 	These guys with you?

EMILY	Agnes, it's okay. Go on.

AGNES	I just...  I feel like if I just knew what they wanted with me, what it is they're trying to do, then everything would be okay.

EMILY	Hi, my name is Emily Reed.

GROUP	Hi, Emily.

EMILY	I was abducted the first time on my seventh birthday.

CHRIS	Did she say her birthday?

BRENT 	Said first time.

EMILY	The second time was the day I turned. And then seven years later, they came for me again. It doesn't matter where I hide or what I do, they always find me. And like all of you, what I want more than anything is to know why.

EMILY	Bye, guys. Thank you again. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Bye, Mike. You too. See you next week.

CHRIS	Is that dude your boyfriend? 'Cause he looked at me like he wants to punch me in the face.

EMILY	Yeah, so do I.

CHRIS	Okay, hold on.

CHRIS	Hold on, let me explain. I was not trying to hurt Adam. I was trying to help him.

EMILY	Help him? By telling someone who's in pain that they're making it up?

CHRIS 	I was merely suggesting to him that maybe what he thinks is real isn't.

EMILY 	And what if there are different versions of reality?

CHRIS	Different versions of reality? Reality is not an opinion.

EMILY	Sure it is. And it's my opinion that you're an asshole.

CHRIS 	There have been studies, and that's not an opinion. There have been studies. Many studies. Studies. You know, the scientific things, which prove that in order for healing to take place, people have to be willing to confront the truth.

EMILY	Okay, you know what? Let me ask you something.

CHRIS	Shoot.

EMILY	What do you see?

CHRIS	I see an arrowhead at the end of a necklace. What do you see?

EMILY	I see a stone that was formed millions of years ago and weapon that was made by an ancient civilization and a piece of jewelry that I've had since before I can remember. Now the truth is that it's billions of atoms made up of trillions of protons, held together by zillions of electrons. That doesn't make any of the other things less true.

CHRIS	I don't think zillions is a real number.

EMILY	Sure it is. It's just this side of the googolplex. Look, no one here actually knows the truth. But all I know for sure is that...something's been happening to me my whole life.

CHRIS	I believe you. What evidence? What actual, hard, empirical evidence do you have that these experiences have been alien abductions and not some other kind of phenomenon?

EMILY	Well, maybe you can see for yourself. Sunday is my th birthday. Seven years to the day since the last time that I was taken.

CHRIS	Nice work, Brent. So much for your hidden camera.

BRENT	Signing off.

BRENT	You think she's real?

CHRIS	I don't know.

CHRIS	I mean, she doesn't seem delusional. I mean, the repeated pattern of abductions is a little strange.That's That's definitely not usual.

BRENT	Well, maybe she just hates birthdays. Kind of like you a couple of years ago, but I guess you wouldn't remember 'cause you passed out in the car.

CHRIS	You know I don't like birthdays. You know why I don't like birthdays because they remind me of my mom. It was not like that though, man. I'm telling you, she's displaying symptoms of FMS.

BRENT	Oh, shit.

BRENT	You see that?

CHRIS	Huh?

BRENT	Look at that. Right there, white light.

CHRIS	Where?

BRENT 	White light, right there.

BRENT	Get the camera.

CHRIS 	Why am I gonna get the camera?

CHRIS 	I'll get the camera, but it's a plane.

BRENT 	It's getting closer!

BRENT	Wow. Wow. It's my first sighting ever.

CHRIS	That's the problem with all this bullshit. You start thinking about it so much, then the next thing you know, your imagination's going crazy.

BRENT	Just get a close-up.

CHRIS 	Is that an alien campground?

BRENT	That's right Oh, shit!

BRENT	Holy shit!

CHRIS 	What the hell, dude!

CHRIS	This is why you never drive!

BRENT	I just hit something.

CHRIS 	What do you mean?

CHRIS	Like an animal?

BRENT 	It wasn't an animal, man.

BRENT	It was something else. You're not going out there, are you?

CHRIS 	Yeah, I'm gonna get out. How else we gonna know what you hit?

BRENT	No, no, don't do it. Don't do it. You're crazy.

CHRIS	Yeah, I'm crazy.

BRENT	Don't do it!

CHRIS 	Well, I'll be damned.

BRENT	Oh, you son of a bitch.

CHRIS 	Hey, you gotta come check this out.

CHRIS	Look at this.
 
BRENT	Oh. Oh.

CHRIS	I guess you did hit something.

BRENT	All right, well

CHRIS 	It's in the bush too.

CHRIS	Oh, it goes this way.

BRENT	So we can get in the car now.

CHRIS	Oh, there's more. Dude, check it out. See the blood?

BRENT	Told you, man. Wasn't my imagination.  Something out there.

BRENT 	Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

CHRIS 	It's just a pig! You thought we found E.T., didn't you, huh?

BRENT	I nearly shit my pants. Oh, shit! Oh, my God! Let's get outta here!

BRENT	Chris!

CHRIS 	What?

BRENT	Come on!

CHRIS 	Dude, what the hell you doing?
 
CHRIS	Hey!

BRENT 	Get outta here!

CHRIS	Hey! It's just a pig!

BRENT	Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! There's something out there! Let's go! Come on!

CHRIS 	What the hell is wrong with you? There's nothing out there.

BRENT	Please, please, please! We gotta go.

CHRIS	You're losing your shit, buddy.

CHRIS	It's just a pig.

CHRIS	Brent did film something. He was convinced it looked like this little black alien statue we saw at the convention.

HICKTYN 	Just give me a call.

CHRIS	Ooh.

BRENT	Huh.

CHRIS	Was this what they were talking about?

CHRIS	Looking for...

BRENT 	Hello?

CHRIS	You hear something back there?

CHRIS	Hello?

LUCILLE 	Lose something?

LUCILLE	What can I do for you, my young, very good-looking man?

CHRIS	Well, it seems that we met an associate of yours last night at the convention.

LUCILLE	Yeah, that would be my half-sister, Hicktyn. You probably noticed she's hmm! Not quite all there. That's because her stepdad is from... Joke!

CHRIS	Oh. Anyway we got a few questions for you about a sculpture that Hicktyn mentioned.

LUCILLE	Uh-huh.

CHRIS	Guy in a black cloak?

LUCILLE	Yeah.

LUCILLE	This is the one.

CHRIS	That's it.That's the one that I saw. Yeah, yeah, I know, I saw the footage.

LUCILLE	It's one of the more common sightings in these parts.

CHRIS	Really?

LUCILLE 	Mm.

CHRIS	So you're saying that this is an extraterrestrial?

LUCILLE	Absolutely.

LUCILLE	You know... we get our fair share of nonbelievers come to disprove this or that, but sooner or later, if they stay long enough, they come to realize the truth.

CHRIS	Hmm.

LUCILLE	You come with me. I wanna show you something.

LUCILLE	Come on then. This is where I keep the real important stuff.

CHRIS	Who's that?

LUCILLE	Oh, that's my husband Ed. Just ignore him. This...is a really interesting specimen.

CHRIS	What the hell is that?

LUCILLE	It's a memory stealing device, or at least that's what we think. Most victims experience blackouts and losses of memory during abduction. Sometimes after they return, whole chunks of memories are just missing.

CHRIS	Can I take a closer look at that, please?

LUCILLE	You know, I had it analyzed. They can't identify the materials.

CHRIS	How much do you want for it?

LUCILLE	It's not for sale. It's not even mine.

CHRIS	Where'd you get it then? Whose is it?

LUCILLE	I got it from the same person that described the black-cloak figure. Local girl. Her name's Em.
 
CHRIS	Emily Reed.

LUCILLE	Emily Reed.

KYLE	Okay, this is her place. She's probably in her studio right now. There's a patio around back.

BRENT 	Probably not gonna be too happy to see us.

CHRIS	When has that ever stopped me?

CHRIS	Hello?

BILL 	Emily, I just don't wanna see you get hurt, that's all. I mean, look what they did to Adam at the convention.

CHRIS 	Hey.

BILL 	He's clearly not one of us.

BILL	We got to be careful. 

CHRIS	Hey!

BILL	What are you doing here?

CHRIS	Well, I could ask you the same thing there, cowboy.

BILL	Could you kindly turn the camera off, please? Why don't you just pack up your stuff and just head on back home? She doesn't wanna talk to you.

EMILY	It's okay, Bill.

CHRIS	See? It's okay, Bill. What do ya know?

BILL	I'd be on my best behavior if I were you.  My patience is waning.

CHRIS	Is that a threat?

BILL	Just a little friendly advice.

CHRIS	Hmm.

CHRIS	What is all this?

EMILY 	I sell art at all the local shops in town.

BRENT	Those are the most wonderful-looking bicycle wheels I've ever seen.

EMILY	It's a dream catcher. Catches all the good dreams

CHRIS 	And gets rid of all the bad ones, right? How's that working out for ya?

EMILY 	What can I do for you, Mr. Norton?

CHRIS	Oh, last night on the way home, we saw someone driving

BRENT	Or some thing.

CHRIS 	Someone dressed like this.

CHRIS	Grab it.

CHRIS	The lady from Seti Alpha Five said it was carved from your description.

EMILY	It's not just mine. There are others.

CHRIS	Listen, Emily, I'm not your enemy.

EMILY	Can you hand me those scissors over there, please?

CHRIS	For you.

EMILY	Scissors.

CHRIS	When I was seven, my mom left home. On my birthday, actually. And until the day he died, my father believed that she was abducted by aliens.

CHRIS	But that was just a crazy story he made up in his head, of course. Just another one of his wild conspiracy theories. Truth is, he was an obsessive drunk who drove her away. It's not the aliens' fault she didn't come back. It's his. But no matter how hard I tried, no matter what I said, no matter what I did, I... couldn't get him to confront that truth.

EMILY	I don't understand what you want from me.

CHRIS	There's a technique called "regression hypnosis." Therapists can help you remember what really happened to you, what's still apparently happening to you.
EMILY	Okay.

EMILY	This is what regression therapy did for me.

MAN	Very good, Emily. Now free of any pain or upset, I want you to describe, what you see.

EMILY	The lights are very bright, but it's...it's cold, sterile, like a hospital.

MAN	Is there anyone else there with you?

EMILY	I don't know.

MAN	It's okay, Emily. The memory's completely free of pain. Now who else is there with you?

EMILY	They're, uh... They're tall.

MAN	Good, good, go on.

EMILY	They're looking at me.They want something from me.

MAN	What is it they want?

EMILY	I don't know. I don't know what they want.

MAN	You gotta look deep, Emily. The memory is there. You just have to dig deeper.

EMILY	I can't! No! God, I can't! No!

MAN	It's okay.

EMILY	They're gonna hurt me! They'll hurt me! They will! They don't want me to remember! No! No!

EMILY	I have plenty of sequels just like that. You guys can do a marathon night and watch them all if you want.

CHRIS	The lady from Seti Alpha Five has something called a "memory" device. She said she got it from you. Do you know anything about that?
 
EMILY	Yeah. I, um... I found it the last time they brought me back.

CHRIS	Okay. Found it where?
 
EMILY	Here.

CHRIS	I'd like to get that device analyzed. Do you think you can get it back from Lucille for Brent and I?

EMILY	I don't think so.

CHRIS	Brent and I can take it, get it analyzed, find out where it came from.

EMILY	I don't think so.

CHRIS 	I understand that, but I think

EMILY 	I don't think you're listening! I don't want to, and I really think you guys should leave.

CHRIS	We gotta get our hands on that device.

BRENT 	How? You heard her.

CHRIS 	I don't know.

CHRIS	But whatever's going on with that girl, it has something to do with that device.

BRENT 	So do you still not believe in aliens?

CHRIS	No, of course I don't. Why, do you?

BRENT	I don't know. I saw the thing on the back of her head, man. Some weird fricking shit. Yeah, no shit, it's some weird fricking shit.

CHRIS 	That's why we gotta find out what the hell it is.

KYLE	Everything okay?

CHRIS 	Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

KYLE	He's just been sitting there waiting since you went inside.

CHRIS	Who?

KYLE 	Bill.

CHRIS	Why?

KYLE	I think he's worried you're gonna  hurt business.

CHRIS	Business? You mean preying on people's fears for profit?

KYLE	I'm just saying you should be careful. Bill's a powerful guy around here.

CHRIS	What are you saying, he's dangerous?

KYLE	You don't want any trouble from him. That's what I'm saying.

CHRIS	All right.

KYLE 	There's rumors.

BRENT	What rumors?

CHRIS	What kind of rumors?

KYLE	That he used to be some kinda contractor for the military. Then again, they're just rumors, right?

CHRIS	Yeah, just rumors.

CHRIS	I'd only known Emily for about  hours, and from the first moment I saw her, I knew...I knew... I knew I had to help her if I could. But how do you convince someone that what they believe I mean, really believe is untrue?  Even worse? What happens when you start to believe it too?

BRENT	Activate the low-light sensor if it gets dark. Right here.

CHRIS	Okay, all right, got it.

BRENT 	Tighten this up. All right?

CHRIS	All right.

BRENT 	Think we're ready?

CHRIS	All right, are you ready?

BRENT 	Yeah, I'm ready.

CHRIS	Hey, hey, are you ready?

BRENT 	Okay, I'm ready, but

CHRIS	All right, let's go.

BRENT	Do you really need me to go? You really need me to go? There's no reason for both of us to commit a felony here.

CHRIS	Don't be dramatic. The thing's fake, and when we find out it's fake,  I might need the footage as evidence to prove it.

BRENT	I don't wanna go to jail, man. Make this a quick in and out. We're breaking and entering. Right now committing a crime.

CHRIS	Look at that, just trespassing.

BRENT	Okay.  Just a little trespassing. That's not so bad.

BRENT	Doggy. Doggy. Check these out.

CHRIS	Dude, stop screwing around.

BRENT	They feel so real.

CHRIS	You been in LA too long then.

CHRIS 	Shh!

BRENT 	It's all make-believe. Nothing here is real.

CHRIS	Would you shut up?

BRENT 	What?

CHRIS	You ready?

BRENT	Go.

CHRIS	Hey, turn off the light.

BRENT	What?

BRENT 	Something

CHRIS	Shh.

BRENT	I don't know, man.

BRENT	That's it.

CHRIS	Oh, shit!

BRENT 	Oh!

BRENT	Dude!

ED	Who's there?

CHRIS	Go!

ED	Don't move!

CHRIS	Go!

ED	Get out of my shop, you sons of bitches!

CHRIS	Open, open, open, open!

CHRIS	Come on, let's go! Go!

BRENT 	Go, go, go, go!

CHRIS	Come on, get in!

BRENT 	Go, go, go!

ED	And don't you ever come back!

CHRIS 	Whoo!

BRENT	Dude, I just got shot by an old man in the leg. Think that's funny? It's funny to you?

CHRIS	Yeah, it is kinda

BRENT 	It's not funny.

CHRIS	Whew! Are you okay?

BRENT	Just a little birdshot. Grazed the skin. Hurts like hell though.

BRENT	Good work, good work.

CHRIS 	Yeah!

CHRIS	You've officially been shot at, my friend.

BRENT	I'm gonna use that. That will get me laid, I know it.

BRENT 	I'm shot. You ever been shot?

CHRIS 	I have never been shot.

BRENT	Whew! Here, let me see that thing.

CHRIS	What thing?

BRENT 	The thing I just got shot for.

BRENT 	Let me see it.

CHRIS 	Why? Why do you wanna see it?

BRENT	'Cause I wanna see if it says "Made in China" stamped on it.

CHRIS	See it?

BRENT 	Let me see the fricking thing.

BRENT	What the hell is this all about anyway? You gotta see this thing up close, man.

CHRIS	I did. I held it.

BRENT	No, you gotta feel it.

BRENT	It feels like It's like nothing I've ever felt before.

CHRIS	You sound like you're describing a woman right now.

BRENT 	It's even more foreign than that. What the hell!

CHRIS	What the hell What the fuck was that?

BRENT	I don't know, man.

CHRIS 	Holy shit.

BRENT	Felt like electricity like all through my hands.

CHRIS	What, from that? From that thing?

BRENT	Yeah, yeah, I just rubbed it, and the fricking thing electrocuted me. Okay, okay, we get back to the hotel, we gotta run back the cameras and watch it in slo-mo and see what the hell just happened.

CHRIS	What the fuck was that? Here, give it back now.

BRENT	Gladly.

BRENT	Come on. You're killing me here.

CHRIS	Just seeing if you're alive.

BRENT 	Yeah, well...

KYLE	Where the hell you guys been?

CHRIS	What? What do ya mean? What's wrong?

KYLE	Nothing. Been calling you for hours.

CHRIS 	What are you talking about? We've been gone like, what, less than an hour?

KYLE	It's  A.M., man.

CHRIS	What?

KYLE	It's  A.M.

CHRIS 	What are you talking about?

KYLE	You guys left at .

CHRIS	What?

KYLE	What the hell happened to him?

CHRIS	He got his ass shot.

KYLE 	You okay?

BRENT 	Crazy old guy. It's a long story.

CHRIS 	How is it : in the morning?

BRENT	It can't be. I got some footage you guys gotta see.

BRENT	I'm gonna sync my cameras with the GoPros in the car and see what we got here.

CHRIS	Is it bad? Are you hurt?

BRENT 	I wanna see if it's made in China.

CHRIS 	See it?

BRENT 	See this thing? It's like nothing I've ever felt before.

CHRIS	You sound like you're describing a woman right now.

BRENT 	It's even more foreign than that.

CHRIS 	What?

BRENT	You see that?

CHRIS	Yeah, I saw that.

BRENT 	Fried my camera. Here it is. The flash that was That's the one I was talking about.

CHRIS 	Wait, no, hold on, hold on. Keep playing. There's more.

BRENT	Okay.

KYLE 	What the hell you guys looking at?

BRENT	What the fuck? I don't remember this.

CHRIS	This doesn't make any sense. We're just sitting there staring.

BRENT	Oh, God, just, uh..

CHRIS	Did the engine just die? I don't remember stopping the car. I never stopped the car. I  never pulled over.

CHRIS	But I never stopped the car. I never stopped driving. We were driving the whole time, right? I mean... The thing shocked you, we're still driving, I mean...

BRENT	Look at the time. Time just keeps moving, but we're not going anywhere. What is

CHRIS	Fast forward, fast forward.

BRENT	It's the same, it's the same, it's the same. Okay, I'm... I'm freaked out now, man. Come on.

CHRIS	Now what? We're just driving all of a sudden again?

CHRIS	This doesn't make any sense.

BRENT 	I don't know.

CHRIS 	Holy shit. This is literally impossible.
 
CHRIS	Two hours. We sat there for two hours. I set out to prove that alien abductions were nothing more than false memories, created by fragile minds to cover painful truths. But that's the problem with searching for the truth. Because if you're open and honest and willing to follow the evidence  no matter where it takes you, sometimes... the truth  can be more painful than the dream.

REPORTER	And I know our viewers are really interested because you claim that you have some evidence. Can you share that with us?

PETER	I didn't know at the time, but... my little kid Chris, he...

REPORTER	He filmed you and your wife?

PETER 	Yeah, he filmed it all.

REPORTER	And that's the tape? Can we see it?

REPORTER	So what's happening there?

PETER	Uh, that's me and my wife having a little argument. I was too obsessed with my things and my wife, you know.  There. Fast forward to there. There. Keep watching. You see, that's it. And there's...There's the light, Can you see? Up there. Coming stronger and stronger and then...

REPORTER 	And Peter 

PETER	Poof!

REPORTER 	So you believe that Nell was abducted?

PETER	Maybe we all were abducted, and they forgot to put her back. Yeah, I was gone for a couple of hours, and when I came back, it's like...strange... to be gone for two, three hours.

CHRIS	I've watched the video a thousand times. Every single time from the same perspective. But then last night,omething happened to us when we were driving home. There was a power surge. The power in the car went out, but the cameras kept rolling. Cameras caught us sitting in a trance for two hours, and we don't remember shit. And then I happened to think my dad said the same thing. He said that after the power surge, he blacked out for several hours. As much as I don't like it, I can't ignore the similarity. I have to know what happened last night, and I have to know what happened to him.

EMILY	I already know what happened.

CHRIS	All you know is that somebody attached this device to the back of your head.

EMILY	Where did you get that? Is that why the sheriff's been calling me? I told you I don't want any part of this.

CHRIS	Don't you wanna know what it is? Don't you wanna know why?

EMILY	Unless you can find some way to communicate with them, you can't find out why.

CHRIS	You'd just rather have your head in the sand? I wanna know! We have to find out where the thing came from.

EMILY	It's my birthday tomorrow.

CHRIS	No.

CHRIS	That's why... you have to let me lead you to the truth.

EMILY	Why do you care so much? I mean, we just met.

CHRIS	I don't know. I don't know.

EMILY	I don't know if it'll change anything. I don't think it will, but...if you really do wanna stay with me,I'm going someplace today, someone who might be able to help. Do you wanna come?

EMILY	Hey, pull over for a second.

CHRIS	Wow. I've read a lot about this place.

EMILY	It's home of the ancestral Pueblo peoples. Some call them "Anasazi." They ruled this area for hundreds of years.

BRENT	Let me grab my camera, get some top view of this place.

EMILY	There's still a lot of unanswered questions about their civilization.

CHRIS	Yeah, like why they built those pits, allegedly contact with extraterrestrials. You okay?

EMILY 	Yeah. We should get to the pueblo, It's not too far.

EMILY	Just make a right here.

CHRIS 	Right here?

EMILY	Yeah.

CHRIS	Not to be cynical, but... I'm still not sure how these people can help you.

EMILY	Well, for starters, they believe me. These people, they practically raised me. I mean, they were there when no one else cared. They taught me what it was like to have a family. They helped me go through some really hard times. They're pretty incredible people. You might wanna show some respect.

CHRIS 	I don't mean to be disrespectful. I'm just trying to understand.

EMILY	You can pull up just right here on the left.

BRENT 	We made it.

EMILY 	Yep.

EMILY	Just up here.

EMILY	Hey, babes.

CHRIS	You know these guys?

EMILY	Yeah.Boys.

GREATBEAR	Whoo! Mmm! You oughta try the sheep chili. It's outta this world. Literally. Elu, I'm glad you came. It has been too long.

CHRIS	Elu?

EMILY	It's the Indian name I was given. John, this is Chris Norton. He's a filmmaker. This is John Greatbear, He's the village medicine man and the closest thing I have to a father.

GREATBEAR 	More like Grandpa.

EMILY	He's the one who says he can protect me.

CHRIS	But how can you protect her?

GREATBEAR	My people have history with the Old Ones. We have make an arrangement in the past.

CHRIS	Wait, the Old Ones, is that the ancient ancestral Pueblo peoples? Okay.

GREATBEAR	It's cold outside.

EMILY 	Thank you.

BRENT 	Hey, nice to meet you. I'm Brent. Camera guy. I love chili.

EMILY	There's a ritual, something that might convince them not to take me. And it hasn't been done in a while, but it can't hurt to try, right?

CHRIS	I just don't want anything to happen to you.

EMILY	I don't either.

GREATBEAR 	Come, my friend. Sit with us. Let us leave our mind in the cold and warm our heart in here.

EMILY	Don't be afraid.

CHRIS	Who, me?

BRENT	You sure you wanna do that? Remember Malibu? Took mushrooms, running around naked? Not a good idea.

CHRIS	What are you doing?

EMILY 	I want you to wear this for a while. I could never remember where I actually got it, so I just made up my own story. I was with my mom, and we were picking flowers, and they smelt so wonderful, and then we turned into the rainbow and the little shadow that runs across the grass, into the sunset. She's always there to remind me that...sometimes dreams are more real than the truth. Don't let go of the dream.

CHRIS	I won't.

BRENT	See you on the other side.

CHRIS	I hate you!

CHRIS	You son of a bitch! You son of a You took everything from me! You took my mother!

CHRIS	You took my mother! You took my mom! You beat me! You beat me! And you beat me! You beat me! You took my mother! You took my mother! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

BRENT	Dude. I thought you were a dead man. I thought you OD'd on that stuff.

CHRIS 	What happened?

BRENT 	You freaked out. 

CHRIS	What?

BRENT 	You don't remember anything?

CHRIS	No, not really.

EMILY	Hey, how are you feeling?

CHRIS	Oh, God. Like I got run over by a truck.

CHRIS	So what's Crazybear saying?

EMILY	Greatbear. Nothing yet. He's waiting to see if the ritual worked.

CHRIS	How long until we know?

EMILY	Couple hours.

CHRIS	Oh, God.

BRENT	Couple hours.

CHRIS	We're supposed to sit here and wait until then?

EMILY	Yeah, pretty much. I think my hand's turning blue.

CHRIS	Hmm? Oh. Sorry.

CHRIS	How are you so calm?

EMILY	I don't know. Normally I'd be a wreck, but...I think it's you. I just I don't feel afraid now because of you.

CHRIS	That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. All right, well...You got the rough cut and the raw footage?

BRENT	Yeah. Why?

CHRIS	All right. I'm gonna get to work.

CHRIS	My name is Chris Norton, and I'm a documentary filmmaker. I shot my first film, if you can call it that, on my seventh birthday.

GREATBEAR	There is a way of things. Some outside our understanding. The ceremony did not work.  I am very sorry.

CHRIS	What does that mean?

GREATBEAR	It means the sky people will come. They will take her. There's nothing more that we can do.

CHRIS	Do you know how much time we wasted? Hours. We wasted hours. I could've had her in Fort Knox by now.

GREATBEAR	It would not matter. They need her.

CHRIS	What could they possibly need her for?

GREATBEAR	Something important. Something they have lost through time. Their civilization honors rational mind,but has forgotten the gift. They need to find their way back...to their soul.

CHRIS	I drank your potion. I trusted you. We trusted you. You said that you could help her.

EMILY	Hey, let's just go, okay? Let's go. Let's go.

GREATBEAR	Elu! You were chosen for a great cause.  It is a burden that is part of your  destiny. Don't let go of the dream, my child.

EMILY	I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry.

BRENT	Okay, look, where are we going?

CHRIS	I don't know where we're going. Somewhere to protect her. We have to get her somewhere safe. I don't know. Somewhere we can create a defense, all right?

BRENT	Sounds like a plan. Not sure what it means exactly, but we'll get somewhere safe.

EMILY	You don't understand. It doesn't matter where we go or what we do.

BRENT	Look out!

BRENT 	What the hell is that? What the fuck is this? Oh, no.

BRENT	Let's go.

CHRIS	I'm the driver.

EMILY	Oh, my God. Chris!

BRENT	Go!	

EMILY 	Start the car!

CHRIS	I'm trying, I'm trying!

EMILY	Move the car!

CHRIS	It's not going.

BRENT 	Come on, move!

CHRIS	The car is not moving!

EMILY	Lock the doors!

CHRIS	Shit.

EMILY	No!

CHRIS	Emily!

CHRIS	Emily! Emily!

BRENT	Ow! Ow!

CHRIS 	God, no!

CHRIS	Emily! Emily! Emily! Emily! Emily! Emily!

CHRIS	You sons of bitches!

BILL 	I didn't want it to come to this, that's for sure. I was told you were doing a story on abduction,  not a hatchet job on our way of life. Then when I found outyour true intent, well, I asked you to leave, but you didn't listen, did you?

CHRIS	It's all a bunch of bullshit.

BILL	Oh, no. It's, uh, quite real. We just help perpetuate the truth.

CHRIS	Jesus Christ.

KYLE	Footage is on the laptop, but they might have copies.

BILL	We have to be sure.

BILL	You're right about the false  memories, you know? Even more than you think.

CHRIS	What the fuck are you doing?

BILL	Don't worry. I'm a pro. I've done this a hundred times. Now back in the MK Ultra days, it was trial and error, but now we got it down to a science. All it takes is a little military grade hallucinogen and some creative set design, and your subconscious mind will absolutely be convinced that this abduction was real. Don't worry. Couple minutes, you'll black out, and two hours from now, you'll remember what everyone else does.

BILL	Well, damn, I missed the vein. Steel rooms, figures in black, bright lights. Hold still. Hold still, goddamn it. You hold still! Otherwise, I'll get the cattle prod, and I'll hit you with it again. Don't you worry. It'll all be over soon, and the great Chris Norton will corroborate the truth, that alien abductions are real.

BILL	Goddamn it! Crazy son of a bitch! As usual, you just have to do it the hard way, don't ya? Well...I think I'll just go get a cattle prod, another needle. Don't go anywhere... cowboy.

CHRIS	There's gotta be...

BRENT	Hey, man.

CHRIS	Quiet.

BRENT	Where are we?

CHRIS	It's Bill. We gotta get outta here.

BRENT	What a dick.

CHRIS	Be quiet.

EMILY	Chris. Where are we?

CHRIS	Shh, it's okay.

EMILY	Are we...

CHRIS 	No, it's all Bill.

CHRIS	It's not real.

EMILY	What?

EMILY	Bill? What are you talking What are you talking about? Chris

BILL	Kyle!  Kyle! Come here, son. Bring me the damn case with the syringes.

CHRIS	It's all a hoax.

CHRIS	It's been Bill all along.

EMILY	What?

CHRIS 	It's all a setup. It's all bullshit. The metal table, the abductions, all of it.

CHRIS	Just breathe, okay?

EMILY	What are you talking about?

CHRIS	Just breathe.

EMILY 	It doesn't make any sense.

EMILY	It's been happening to me my whole life.

CHRIS 	It's all a hoax. It's all bullshit. It's all a setup

EMILY	It doesn't make any sense. The first time it happened, I was so young. It doesn't make any sense.

CHRIS	I know, I know. We're gonna do this together. I'm gonna get us outta here.

BRENT	Hey, man, you're bleeding.

CHRIS	I'm fine.

CHRIS	Stay quiet, okay? They're right out there.

CHRIS	Let's go.

BRENT	I need a beer.

EMILY	Oh!

CHRIS	Come on.

BRENT	Get up.

CHRIS	Jesus, where are we?

CHRIS	We gotta turn around. Find another way out. Oh, shit.

KYLE	Over here, Bill!

CHRIS	You watch it.

BILL	Yeah. There ain't nowhere to go, is there, boy? All right, I don't want this to get out of hand.

CHRIS	I'll give you all the footage, and we'll go.

BILL	Oh, my God.

CHRIS	Bill? No, Bill, stop. Stop! Bill!

CHRIS	Emily! Emily! Emily!

CHRIS	Where Oh, God. Emily.

CHRIS 	Oh, God. Emily, wake up.

CHRIS	Emily, Emily. I need you to listen to my voice, okay? I need you to come back to me. I've never met anyone like you in my life. You're kind to people. You take care of them. Emily, I need you to wake up.  That's it. You can do it. Concentrate on my voice. Just concentrate. You can create your own dreams. Okay, that's it.

CHRIS	There you go. Hey.

EMILY	Chris?

CHRIS	Yeah.

EMILY 	You're here.

CHRIS	Yeah.

CHRIS	Are you okay?

EMILY	Oh, God.

CHRIS	Get me outta here.

EMILY	I'm afraid if I push the wrong one, something bad will  happen.

CHRIS	Yeah, well, we gotta try something, right? I won't hold it against you if my eyeballs explode or anything. Go on, no pressure.

EMILY	What do we do now?

CHRIS	I don't know. Figure out how to get the hell outta here.

CHRIS	Who's there?

EMILY	Chris. Chris. 

CHRIS 	What do you want?

CHRIS	Stay back.

CHRIS	Stay back!

CHRIS	No, no more of that. We're done with that.

PETER	How many times have I told you never to do this?

NELL	Get off him!

PETER	Hey, you stay out of it! You stay out of it!

CHRIS	I don't remember this.

NELL	What is wrong with you?

PETER 	Hey!

PETER 	Stop it! Shut up! Can you go and watch some TV, huh?Hey, Nell, where you going? Are you happy now? Yeah, yeah, bye-bye! Chris, go to bed. Nell! Nell! 

EMILY	What? They took you?
 
CHRIS	No. It's impossible. Make it stop. Make it What do you want?!

EMILY	Stop. Please! Please, stop!

CHRIS	Who are you?

ALIEN	We are the product of human evolution over many years.

CHRIS	What?

ALIEN	In time, our ego crystallized. We have become tethered to reason and something was lost.

CHRIS	What are you doing to us?

ALIEN	We erase the bad memories to understand if your future could be different than the past.

EMILY	We don't need you. Not anymore.

CHRIS	Please.  We just wanna go home.

BRENT	Hey, guys. Did you see that light? You guys see that UFO in the sky? Huh? Don't ignore me. Hey! Hey, guys!  Hey, over here!

KELLY	Channel Four NMX News. We have reports of strange lights.

BRENT	Over here!

CAMERAMAN	Who are you?

BRENT	We're filmmakers. We're from Hollywood. We're making a documentary.

CARLOS	An unbelievable story that adds yet another claim of alien abduction in our community.Our reporter, Kelly Lamas, has the story. Kelly?

KELLY	Thank you, Carlos. I'm in McKinley County, where local artist Emily Reed...

CHRIS	Turns out we were gone for only two hours. Kyle disappeared. ?As for us, we can only remember flashes, but... we remember enough.

KELLY 	Are you on any narcotics?

BRENT	Not true. It happened-There ws a light in the sky. And I think I think it was a UFO.

CHRIS	Our story was dismissed as being a product of hallucinogenic drugs. The irony is, I became the thing I was most resistant to. I became the story.

CARLOS	Might finally shed some light on this controversial phenomenon, Is it aliens or is it just the mind playing tricks?

SON	Check that out.

BRENT	Aah!

EMILY	Oh, no!

EMILY	No!

CHRIS	Ah, Brent, come on.

BRENT	These things happen. Why do you blame me?

EMILY	You know what happens when we tell him anything.

CHRIS	I know, but Brent likes to participate.

EMILY	Don't touch it. You're gonna make it worse. You got icing all over your hands.

CHRIS	That's the best part of it.

BRENT 	Surprise!

ALL	Surprise!

BRENT	Hey, give me a hand slam!

SON	Is this for me?

EMILY	Yeah, it's for you. Uncle Brent dropped it a little bit. It was a spaceship before Uncle Brent dropped it.

SON	It's okay.

EMILY	It's okay!

EMILY	Wanna blow out the candles?

CHRIS	Happy seventh birthday.

TRAVIS WALTON	We saw a light in the trees, and, uh, I got out, went up for a closer look, and I was hit by a blast of energy from the craft that knocked my unconscious. I woke up onboard the craft.

CHRIS	Do you have any hard, actual physical evidence?
