(THOMAS & FRIENDS)
(EARL’S QUIZ)
(BOUNCY AND LAMP)


EARL OF SODOR		well, hello! the earl of sodor here! you know, sodor is such an exciting place. there are so many wonderful things to see! but, just how closely are you watching...?...very closely i hope, because i'll be asking questions about what you've seen. ohh it looks like thomas is in a big hurry to get to the docks... slow down, thomas! you don't want to have an accident... oooh dear! too late! and now look what's happened! (chuckles) that's a very bouncy mess you've caused there, thomas. i do hope you're going to help tidy up! are you ready for the first question? what type of balls were bouncing all over the docks? were they beach balls? were they footballs? or were they bouncy balls? they were red bouncy balls. oh ho very bouncy indeed! (laughs) it's going to be quite a task to find them all and put them back in their crate. good job thomas has lots of friends to help! hooray! that was fun. let's play again! when it's dark the engines lamps are lit, so they can see where they're going. toad is wearing a red lamp, because he's at the back of the train. but gator has a different coloured lamp, because he's at the front. what colour lamp was gator wearing? was it a white lamp? was it a red lamp? or was it a green lamp? engines wear a white lamp at the front. a white lamp means your looking at the front of the train. and if you can see a red lamp your looking at the back. oh jolly well done for playing! i look forward to seeing you again next time! goodbye!
