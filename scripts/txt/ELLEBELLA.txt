ELLA BELLA	A rope, an old book, choclate cake,  signed picure of dad, the birthday gift I got from my very best friend.

HENRY	Wow.  You are amazing Ella!

ELLA BELLA	This is nothing.  You should have been at the circus.  There were dancers, acrobats and clowns, but best of all was...

HENRY	What Ella, what???

ELLA BELLA	The magician.  He made the clowns disappear!

HENRY	I have actually never been at a circus before.

ELLA BELLA	Really?

HENRY	It is true.

ELLA BELLA	Bingo!  We have to make a circus here.  Circus Sunshine.

ELLA BELLA	We are going to make a circus here at Sunshine Gardens.  Do you want to join us?

MS. BERG	I’d love to.  In my younger years, I ran away with a circus to Copacabana.  It is going to be fun to performe some old tricks again.

ELLA BELLA	What are you going to do?

MS. BERG	You have to wait.  It is going to be a surprise.

ELLA BELLA	Lisa and Lottie, we are going to make a circus.  Do you wanna join?

TWINS	We can juggel!

LISA	It was my idea.

LOTTIE	No, it was my idea.

HENRY	Ella is making a circus for me.  Can’t you join us?

HENRY’S MOM	Of course, Jurgen and me can do a dance number.

JURGEN	Kiss me, mon cherie! 

ELLA BELLA	Dady do you want to be part of our circus.  

DAD	What a fantastic idea!

ELLA BELLA	You can be a clown.

HENRY	All dads are clowns. Dad And I can play my saxophone.

ELLA BELLA	Hi, Mr. Jackson, how’s the circus coming along?

MR. JACKSON	Nearly done, Ella!  What’s your act for the circus?

ELLA BELLA	We are doing a magic trick.

MR. JACKSON	Fantastic!  

HENRY	Do you wanna see?

MR. JACKSON	Pfft no.

MR. JACKSON	I’m just kidding.  Of course I want to see.

ElLA BELLA	The magical Ella and her great assistant is presenting; The missing chicken!

MR. JACKSON	It is not dangerous Ella?

Mr. JACKSON	But...

ELLA BELLA	Hocus Pocus.

MR. JACKSON	But... Where is my chicken?

ELLA BELLA	Hocus Pocus.

ELLA BELLA	And tonite it is going to be even more spectacular!  I am going to make Henry disappear. 

JACKSON	But, but.. What if something goes wrong?

ELLA BELLA	Everyone is looking forward to our magic act! 

HENRY	I know. It’s gonna be great! 

LISA	We bought matching costumes for our routine.

LOTTIE	Mine’s more matching than hers.

HENRY	Ah... costumes.  We’re going to need those.

MR. JACKSON	Bonjur Madame!

MS. BERG	I was going to use these old curtains for the stage - but they’ve got too many holes.

ELLA BELLA	Bingo! 

TWINS	What? 

HENRY	Hmmm?

MS BERG/MR JACKSON	What?

ELLA BELLA	We could make our own costumes! Yohooo! 

MS. BERG	What a very good idea, Ella. I can whip them up on my sewing machine. 

ELLA BELLA	Lets do it right away!

LISA/LOTTIE	Costumes out of old curtains???  With holes???

LISA/LOTIE	Her fault!

JOHNNY’S DAD	I was wondering if you could help me. We are looking for Number 26 Sunshine Gardens. 

JACKSON	It’s the white house across the road.  You can’t miss it.

JHONNY’S DAD	Johnny boy, we’re here! 

JOHNNY	Hi. I’m Johnny. I’m from the City.

ELLA BELLA	I’m Ella. I’m from... over there.

JOHNNY	Cool. 

HENRY	And I’m Henry. I’m from... over there too. 

JOHNNY	Give me five.

JOHNNY	I do this with my buddies, all the time.

LISA	We're Lisa and Lottie.

LOTTIE	Actually it’s Lottie and Lisa. 

JOHNNY	Good to meet you. So what do you guys do round here?

LISA	We like... juggling?

JOHNNY	Juggling, uh-huh. 

LOTTIE	And playing on the swings in the park.

ELLA BELLA	Well, tonight we’re doing a circus! “Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to Sunshine Circus!” 

JOHNNY	A circus? I used to live in Florida, where we had the world’s biggest circus on my doorstep. 

JOHNNY	Me and my buddies used to go there all the time. 

JOHNNY	What’s he doing? 

ELLA BELLA	Oh, that’s Mr. Jackson. Everyone is performing at the circus... you can do an act too.

JOHNNY	Uh... I dunno.  Sound’s like kid’s stuff.

ELLA BELLA	Uh, no.  It’s actually pretty cool. Me and Henry are doing magic, aren’t we Hen...  

ELLA BELLA	Henry?

HENRY	Is that what I think it is? 

JOHNNY	My bike, yeah. 

HENRY	You have a Victor Supreme? 

JOHNNY	Yeah, but it´s an old model.

HENRY	Carbon fibre, with gyro brakes, 60 shifts and tracking device.

JOHNNY	So you’re a bike nut too. 

ELLA BELLA	Me and Henry both like bikes.  We’re best friends, you know...

HENRY	I always wanted a Supreme. 

JOHNNY	Here you go. Try it. 

JOHNNY	You want me to teach you some tricks? 

HENRY	That would be... awesome!

JOHNNY/HENRY	Yeah!

JOHNNY	Come on, let’s check out our garden, you can ride the bike there. 

HENRY	Oh-kay....

ELLA BELLA	Henry! What about our Circus? 

HENRY	What? Oh!  Uh... I’ll be back! I promise. 

LISA	Don’t worry, Ella! You can play with us instead!

JOHNNY´S UNCLE	It´s great Johnny wants to stay with us, while you are traveling.

JOHNNY´S MOM	Johnny, you have to say hello.

JOHNNY	Hi Uncle, hi Auntie.

JOHNNY´S AUNT	It seems like he enjoys it here already.

JOHNNY´S UNCLE	Here at Sunshine Garden we are all friends.

JOHNNY	Watch this. 

JOHNNY	I call this one - Off the Wall!

JOHNNY	Next The Barspin.

JOHNNY	And for my big finale! I will do the Dangerous Dive of Danger.  Henry - put a ramp up dude!

HENRY	Are you okay?

JOHNNY	Meant to do that!

JOHNNY	You try, my man... 

JOHNNY	Your go, Henry...

JOHNNY	That’s it Henry, see if you can take the jump!

HENRY	Oooooohhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

HENRY	That was the best thing, ever!

JOHNNY	That was the ultimate Dangerous Dive of Danger!

JOHNNY	You are cool man!

HENRY	Cool?  No one’s ever called me that before. 

LISA	Stay still, Ella - I’m going to give you curls for the circus.

LOTTIE	No - it’s gonna be straight.

LISA	Curls!

LOTTIE	Straight

ELLA BELLA	I think we are done!

LISA/LOTTIE	Don’t be silly! You are going to look sooo pretty for our Circus.  

LISA	Johnny´s hair is really cool.

LOTTIE	It is the coolest hair ever.

ELLA BELLA	Wow that’s just what I wanted. Great job. Gotta go! Bye!

LOTTIE	But we are not finished yet!

ELLA BELLA	Oh yes, we are. Henry A boomerang!  Ella would love this. 

JOHNNY	It’s from Australia, mate. I lived there for a while. And London and America.

Henry	You’ve lived all round the world, Johnny. You must have so many friends.  

Johnny	I’ve got loads of friends. Millions. Billions. Gazillions. 

JOHNNY	My mom’s job takes us all over the place.  We even lived on an oil rig once!  Wouldn’t recommend it. (beat) Where’s the best place you ever lived?

HENRY	Sunshine Gardens. In fact, it’s the only place I’ve ever lived.

JOHNNY	I am going to stay here with my uncle and auntie while my parents are working in Kuala Lumpur.  I could choose between this place and my grannies.  I am happy I chose this place.

HENRY	Me too! 

HENRY	Are these...?

JoHNNY	Yep.  Kung Fu Ninja Swords!

JOHNNY	Hey! Maybe we could be Kung Fu Ninjas at the circus together?  You and me? 

ELLA’S DAD	Everything ready for your Circus?

ELLA BELLA	Yup. And it’s gonna be great!

ELLA'S DAD	Where is Henry?

ELLA BELLA	He’ll call round later.

ELLA BELLA	Aaaaaaaahhh!!!

ELLA BELLA	Stop the invaders!

ELLA BELLA	Only me. 

ELLA BELLA	I’ve got a hockey stick, Centurion Megablaster, sword, football, slime, rubber teeth...

ELLA BELLA	What do you say, suckers! Let’s play!

JOHNNY	You do not look like a Ninja.

HENRY	Come on, Ella.  We should help Ms. Berg with our costumes... 

ELLA BELLA	Really?

JOHNNY	No way, can’t you stay and play a bit longer, Henry?  

ELLA BELLA	Sorry Johnny.  Henry’s right, we need to get our costumes. 

JOHNNY	But, I thought we were friends, Henry? 

HENRY	We are!  But I promissed Ella.  You should come to our Circus later today?

MS. BERG	Reminds me of when I made the royal wedding robes for the King of Siam! He liked a lot of velvet! 

MS. BERG	Now then - there’s the first one. This is for you, Henry.

ELLA BELLA	You look... cool, Henry!

HENRY	Right?  I’ve been hearing that a lot lately.

ELLA BELLA	Way to go, Henry. 

JOHNNY	Hey buddy! 

HENRY	Johnny!	

ELLA BELLA	We don’t have time for you, Johnny.  We’re getting ready for our amazing circus.

JoHNNY	Oh. So then I guess you don’t want to see the super mega uber ultra cool thing I’ve got out here...

HENRY	Is it really that cool?

JOHNNY	Cooler than penguin ear.

HENRY	Wow.  That’s pretty cool!

MS. BERG	You go on - I’ll finish the costumes on my own.

JOHNNY	Mum and Dad bought me the brand new BMX Victor Galaxy! I am very lucky,  they always give me something nice when they go away for a long time.

HENRY	Oh... wow, a Victor Galaxy.....

JOHNNY	Isn’t that awesome??? We’ll get to hang out and do everything togehter for ever.

ELLA BELLA	Yeah. That’s great. But right now, Henry and I really need to...

JOHNNY	But you know what else this means? 

HENRY	Your old bike...

JOHNNY	I’m giving it to you, Henry. 

HENRY	My own Victor Supreme...

HENRY 	It’s like a dream come true. You’re the best Johnny.

ELLA BELLA	Yeah, that’s great.  Anyway, Henry and I really need to go and practice for...

JOHNNY	And check this out. I was thinking maybe we could do a stunt jump together at the Circus? What do you think?

HENRY	Cool Johnny.  I love it!

ELLA BELLA	Woah woah woah!  Wait a minute, Johnny. Henry is my friend. And he is not doing a bike jump with you. He is doing magic with me! 

JOHNNY	So? Why can’t he do both? 

ELLA BELLA	Because... It’ not part of the program!  

ELLA BELLA	We have been planing this for weeks and he doesn’t have enough time to learn a new act at the last minute!  We have to rehearse our magic number.  

JOHNNY	Well, if you’ve been rehearsing for weeks, you ought to know how to do it by now, right?  

JOHNNY	Besides, Henry doesn’t need to rehearse, he’s an awesome bike rider - a total natural.  Didn’t you know that?

ELLA BELLA	I have known Henry all my life. You have known Henry a day. He is MY friend and HE’s going to do the magic trick with ME.

JohNNY	Oh come on.  You don’t own Henry.  Why don’t yo ask him what he wants to do?

ELLA BELLA	I know what Henry wants to do!  WE’re best friends.

JOHNNY	So why don’t you let him make his own decisions?

ELLA BELLA	We already decided!  The end.

JOHNNY	Let him speak for himself. Or are you afraid he would rather do the jump with me?

ELLA BELLA	Don’t put words in his mouth.

JOHNNY	Oh, but YOU can?

ELLA BELLA	YES!  I am his MY FRIEND.

JOHNNY	More like his mom.

HENRY	Please stop fighting.

ELLA BELLA	You’re just jealous, because Henry likes ME and my magic act and my circus more than YOU and your stupid old bike!

JOHNNY	Oh yeah?  PROVE it!  Ask him.

ELLA BELLA	FINE! (she turns to Henry)  Do you want to be MY friend or HIS friend?

HENRY	Stop telling me what to do!  This isn’t fun anymore!  Leave me alone.

ELLA BELLA	Henry! Henry, come back! Please...

ELLA BELLA		Now look at what you have done.

JoHNNY	Me?

ELLA BELLA	Everything was great until you came along!  You ruined everything!

LISA	Are you okay, Ella?

LOTTIE	You look a bit down?

ELLA BELLA	Henry says he doesn’t want to be in the circus with me any more.  He yelled at me!  He’s never yelled at me before.

LISA	Don’t worry, Lottie and I yell at each other all the time.

LOTTIE	The best thing to do is to say sorry and make up, even if you don’t want to say sorry.

LISA	That’s what I always do.

LOTTIE	No.  That’s what I always do!

LISA	I do it first.

ELLA BELLA	You’re both right! 

LISE/LOTTIE	We are?

ELLA BELLA	I need to find Henry and say sorry, so he will join me at the circus.

ELLA BELLA	Henry! I’m sorry!  I can’t do the circus without you Henry.

ELLA BELLA	Have you seen Henry? 

HENRY'S MOTHER	No, I thought he was with you?

ELLA BELLA	We need to practice our magic act or it will be ruined.

JURGEN	Ay, caramba!  Speaking of practice - Vamos.

ELLA BELLA	If I don’t find him, the circus will be a disaster!

HeNRY’S MOM	Henry is responsible, he doesn’t go anywhere without permission.

JuRGEN	Excellent, mi amor!  Now YOU lead!

HENRY’S MOM	He’ll be back for dinner.

ELLA BELLA	But what if he doesn’t?  I can’t do the magic by myself.

JuRGEN	Now I lead again, backwards! Vamos!

ELLA BELLA	But this is a circus emergency!

JuRGEN	Dios Mio!  Circus emergency?  That sounds like a big problem for just one kid.

ELLA BELLA	Bingo! That’s it!  I’m NOT just one kid.  We can look for him together!

HENRY	Ella?  ELLA?

HENRY	Who is it?

HENRY	Daisy!

HENRY	Dad!

HENRY’S DAD	We saw you biking into the woods and followed you. Are you okay?

HENRY’S DAD	You shouldn’t be out here on your own, you know. Why are you not together with Ella?  Your circus is tonite.
HENRY’S DAD	Did you have a fight?

HENRY’S DAD	If you’d rather not talk about it just say “yes”.

HENRY	Yes.

HENRY’S DAD	Made you talk.

HENRY´S DAD	Well, being by yourself won’t help.  So how about we get some ice cream?

HENRY’S DAD	What about you, Daisy?  Want some ice cream.

HENRY´S DAD	Made you bark.

ELLA BELLA	We have to find Henry.  We are going to save the circus.  Are we ready?!  Dad?

ELLA BELLA	Jurgen?

ELLA BELLA	Twins?

ELLA BELLA	Mr. Jackson?

ELLA BELLA	Ms. Berg?

ELLA BELLA	In that case, we’re set. The first place to check Henry’s Dad’s House. Henry often goes there.

ELLA BELLA	Operation Henry is on!  Let’s move out!

JOHNNY	Wait for me! 

JOHNNY	Can I come? 

ELLA BELLA	We’ve got enough people as it is, thanks, Johnny. We don’t need your help.

JOHNNY	Oh, too bad, because...

JOHNNY	I was thinking my GPS tracker, night vision goggles and two way walkie talkie radio might help?

ELLA'S DAD	We can use all the help finding Henry we can get.  Right Ella?

ELLA BELLA	Welcome to the team.

JOHNNY	Catch. Now we can be in constant contact.

ELLA BELLA	Thanks.

JOHNNY	Okay team - let’s go find my buddy!

ELLA BELLA	Whatever you say... buddy.

ELLA BELLA	You can make it, Ms. Berg!

MS. BERG	I’m going as fast as I can! This reminds me of my old gang - the 

Wild Angles. 	“Born to be wild...” 

ELLA’S DAD	He’s a great kid, Johnny. A real breath of fresh air. And he and Henry have so much in common. 

HENRY´S DAD	Maybe this will put a smile back on your face kiddo.

HENRY´S DAD 	How about a King Size Tutti Frutti Ice Cream Boat with two times the Tutti and four times the Fruttie?  

HENRY´S DAD	You mean I sat on all that ice cream and got a blue Tutti Frutti booty for nothing.

HENRY´S DAD 	I know what will cheer you up...

ELLA´S	Dad No one in.

JuRGEN	I could try his Dad’s mobile?

JURGEN	It’s ringing.

ELLA BELLA	He left it behind. But Henry was definitely here. I can see his bag.

JOHNNY	No one in.  Hey, great plan, Ella! 

ELLA bELLA	Maybe they went out somewhere?

LiSA	So where could they be?

Mr. JACKSON	The thing you have to ask yourself is - if you were Henry what would you do in this situation? 

Ella BELLA	What would you do, Mr. Jackson, if you where Henry? 

MR. JACKSON	I have no idea. I’m not Henry. 

Lottie	So Ella Bella, where do you think Henry has gone? You’re his best friend, you would know. 

Johnny	Ha! You call yourself his best friend and you don’t know. Sweet!

ELLA BELLA	Sweet? Bingo! I know where Henry is.

ELLA BELLA	There it is!

ELLA BELLA	Are you coming?

JURGEN	Err - I’ll just check to see if he is in there.

ELLA BELLA	There?  He won’t be dancing like that, he’s not old enough!

JURGEN	You’re never too young to learn dance...

ELLA BELLA	Excuse me, we are looking for my best friend, Henry. 

ELLA BELLA	Happy Birthday, Henry! 

ELLA BELLA	Do you recognize this person? Server Yeah!

Server	It’s YOU!

ELLA BELLA	I meant the, uh... OTHER person.

SERVER	The boy?  I’ve never seen this boy before in my life.

SERVER	But he does remind me of a boy I DID see in here earlier today.

SERVER	But that boy was a misreable version of the boy in this video.  Someone must have done a real number on the poor guy.  Someone not nice at all -

ELLA BELLA	Okay, okay, we get it.  Thank you.  Do you know where he went?

SERVER	All I know is he sat over there...

SERVER	Now, who wants an ice cream? We just got a new flavor - Quadruple Fudge! The secret ingredient is fudge.

ELLA BELLA	We don’t have time for ice cream!  

LISA	Strawberry sundae, please!

LOTTIE	Chocolate for me!

JOHNNY	Do you do Tutti Frutti?

HENRY´S DAD	Are you ready for Bocaraca Bom Bom?

HENRY	Yeah.  It has 6,000 horse powers and goes from 0 to 90 km/h in 2 seconds and you are weightless 7 times.

HENRY´S DAD	Wow... You are an expert.  How many times have you taken it?

HENRY	56..., but this is the first time I am taking Boom Boom without Ella.

HENRY´S DAD	But it is also the first time we take it together... and it is the first time for Daisy.

ELLA BELLA	We are wasting time here!

JOHNNY	Looking for Henry here would have been a complete waste of time if we didn’t at least get ice cream.  He’s probably miles away by now.

ELLA BELLA	You really don’t know Henry at all, do you? He hates long journeys.

JOHNNY	I bet I know him better than you do!  

ELLA BELLA	Oh please.  Try me.

JOHNNY	What kind of bike does Henry have?

ELLA BELLA	Mhmm... that’s not fair.  You just gave it to him.

JOHNNY	What kind of bike did he have before?

ELLA BELLA	Mhmm... it was blue, no, I think it was green...

JOHNNY	It was a blue 10 shifts DBS Classic.

ELLA BELLA	Okay, if you know Henry so well what's his favourite ice cream?

JOHNNY	Chocolate?

ELLA BELLA	He likes mint chocolate chip. 

JOHNNY	Almost the same. 

ELLA BELLA	What’s his favourite drink?

JOHNNY	So you have known Henry a very long time, but I have my spy gadgets. I bet I will find Henry before you do. 

ELLA BELLA	Ok - challenge accepted!  Whoever finds Henry first gets him all to themselves at the circus.  Deal?

JOHNNY	Deal!

ELLA'S DAD	Ok Ella, where next?

ELLA BELLA	Of course! He went to Dizzie Land.

ELLA´S DAD	Let’s go to Dizzie Land!

JACKSON	I love Dizzie Land!

HENRY´S DAD	Wow.  I used to have a teddy bear just like that, when I was your age.

HENRY	Why?	

HENRY’S DAD	Watch me get it on the first try.

MAN AT COUNTER	They all say that.

HENRY’S DAD	Almost! The sun was in my eyes.

MAN AT COUNTER	They all say that, too.

HENRY´S DAD	Ugh.  Mercury must be in retorgrade!

MAN AT COUNTER	     That one’s new.
HENRY´S DAD	I never really liked that teddy...

HENRY	Can I try?	

MAN AT COUNTER	You hit!  We have a winner.

ELLA BELLA	Let´s go find Henry!

ELLA BELLA	Excuse me.

JACKSON	Madame?!

LOTTIE	Sir?

ELLA’s DAD	We are from Sunshine Gardens...

MS. BERG	We are looking for a boy...

JOHNNY	Have you seen my best friend?...

CHICKENS	Cluck, cluck!

TELLER	I’ve seen a thousand kids that look  like that today. 

JOHHNY	Maybe he didn’t come here after all?

ELLA BELLA	Oh yes he did.

ELLA BELLA	Look!  He was just at the rollercoaster.

ELLA BELLA	Come on!

ELLA BELLA	He must be here somewhere.  First to find Henry!

JOHNNY	I am sure he is by the scare house.  Me and my gang love a good scare.  

LISA & LOTIE	Ohhh, Johnny.

ELLA BELLA	He is my best friend and I know what he likes..

JOHNNY	Let´s see!

ELLA’S DAD	We have to stick together.

JACKSON	Wait Ella, wait Johnny.

JOHNNY	Henry!

MS. BERG	Henry!!!

JOHNNY	Ms. Berg?

ELLA/MR. JACKSON/ELLA’S DAD	Henry! Henry! 

HENRY	The circus will be starting soon.

HENRY´S DAD	Do you wanna go?  We can stay here if you want.

HENRY	Can we just go home.

HENRY´S DAD	You mom is probably wondering where you are by now, huh?

JACKSON	This is going to be fun...  I have not been here in many years.... 

JACKSON	I do hope I remember how to find my way out of here.

ELLA BELLA	Relax Jackons.  I have done this a thousand times with Henry.

HENRY	Look Dad!  We are out!

HENRY´S DAD	Ha ha ha,  I thought for a second we would never get out of there.

ELLA BELLA	I am going to find Henry long before the others, and then everyone will understand I am his best friend and I will forgive him for just leaving me...

JACKSON	I thought you were going to ask for forgiveness.

ELLA BELLA	What for?

ELLA BELLA	Sorry.... Jackson?!

JACKSON	Ella?  Where.. Auuhh!

JACKSON	It was just me.

ELLA BELLA	Stay where you are Jackson.  I am going to find you.

JACKSON	Now I remeber why I stopped coming here.

JACKSON	Thsi place is claustrophobic.  How do I get out of here?

ELLA BELLA	Jackson, I think it is this way... or maybe this way... or maybe not...

JACKSON	This place is dangerous!

ELLA BELLA	It was more fun with Henry, he always found our way out of here.

JACKSON	You miss him, don´t you?

ELLA BELLA	The magic number, the circus, nothing works without Henry.  He has destroyed everything.

JACKSON	Are you mad at him?

ELLA BELLA	Not really,  I am mad at Johnny, with his new bike, all the toys and all his friends, and all his money...

ELLA BELLA	All I ever wanted, was a friend for myself.  But what if Henry likes Johnny better?  What if I have already lost?

JACKSON	Sometimes things aren´t what they seem.

JACKSON	Ella?

ELLA BELLA	Jackson!  I am so happy, I have not lost you.

JACKSON	Come Ella Bella, I remeber how I used to get out of here.

ELLA BELLA	How?

JACKSON	Help!  Come and help us!!! I have to go to the bathroom.

LOTTIE	Why do you want to find Henry so much anyway? He’s not cool like you. 

JOHNNY	Because Henry is smart and that’s the coolest thing you can be. 

LISA	Is it? 

JOHNNY	Sure. 

CLERK	Everyone gotta pay!

JOHNNY	Keep the change.

LISA & LOTIE	Ohhh, Johnny.

LISA	Do you really think he is in here?

JOHNNY	All my friends love scare rides.

LOTTIE	Henry is scared of the dark... 

Lisa	And half the time he is scared of the light.

LISA	Me too.

JOHNNY	Chill out. It’s all just made up, none of it is real. If you look through my Night Googles, this stuff looks totally fake.

JOHNNY	Holy fruit punch!

JOHNNY	Moooommmmyyyy...

ELLA BELLA	Remember to look for Henry when we reach the top! Before the free fall.

JaCKSON	Got it.  Will do.  Wait, before the what?

MR. JACKSON	Henry!!!

ELLA BELLA	I can’t see Henry anywhere.

MR. JACKSON	Hennnnrrrrryyyyyyyy!

ELLA BELLA	Should we take it one more time?

MR. JACKSON	No, no, no... I think it is best to look for Henry somewhere else... come chickens...

ELLA BELLA	Henry?! Where are you?

ELLA BELLA	Henry?  Are you here?

ELLA BELLA	Johnny?  What are you doing here?

JOHNNY	Same thing you are.

JACKSON	I really thought he might be here!  Ball pits are Henry’s favouite kind of pit..

MS. BERG	Men can sometime be very hard to find.

GUARD	What the..

GUARD 	OUT!  ALL OF YOU, OUT.  NOW!!!  

GUARD	And stay out!!! Who brings chickens to a ball pit???

ELLA’S DAD	Well Ella Bella, you did your best.  That’s all anybody can do. 

ELLA BELLA	If my best is not good enough, I have to do my bester.

JOHNNY	Without Henry I can’t do my stunt jump.

ELLA BELLA	Who cares about that, when the whole circus is ruined?

LOTTIE	Johnny has been looking for Henry just as hard as the rest of us....

LISA	...and he has night-googles, walkietalkie and, and a wrist-watch thing.

JOHNNY	Bingo!

ELLA BELLA	I am the one, who says BINGO.

JOHNNY	Why didn’t I think of that before!

JOHNNY	My GPS tracker!

JOHNNY	It links to the tracker on Henry’s bike. It was fitted in case the bike was stolen. Let me see...

ELLA BELLA	Do you really think...?

ALL	Bingo!

ELLA BELLA	Of course, he’s at the tree house in the woods! 

ELLA´S DAD	Where are you going?

ELLA BELLA	To the tree house.

LISA	But we’ll be late for the Circus!

LOTTIE	And I am hungry.

LISA	She is always hungry.

LOTTIE	So are you!

ELLA’S DAD	I’ll get these girls back home.  - but if Mr. Jackson doesn’t mind, you can go.

JaCKSON	Well I...

ELLA BELLA	Thanks, Dad!  I’ll find Henry, you’ll see! 

JOHNNY	Not if I find him first!

MR. JACKSON	I guess I can kiss that nap goodbye.

Ms. BERG	I used to drive race cars in Monte Carlo.

JACKSON	Wait for me!  You kids are always in such a rush!

JOHNNY	...Out of puff yet...

ELLA BELLA	...I’m not even trying...

JOHNNY	He’s still there. Looks like I’m gonna win.

ELLA BELLA	Not if I get to him first.

JOHNNY	Huh, I’ll easily beat you.

ELLA BELLA	We’ll see about that! 

JOHNNY	I have never been beaten before.

ELLA BELLA	You may just as well get used to it....

MR. JACKSON	Steady now you two!

MR. JACKSON	Oh look - a wheel!

MR. JACKSON	My wheel!

MR. JACKSON	Ahhhh!

MR. JACKSON	My chickens!

HENRY’S MOTHER	Henry? It’s you! 

HENRY’S MOTHER	Where have you been all day, you had us all so worried!

HENRY’S DAD	He’s been with me. He just needed a little cheering up.

HENRY’s MOM	You were with him this whole time, and you didn’t tell anybody? Why didn’t you call?

HENRY’S DAD	I forgot my phone - again!

ELLA BELLA	Heh-heh.  That’s right Johnny, go the long way... I mean, the wrong way.

ELLA BELLA	And I’ll go the short way. The right way.  The winner way.

ELLA BELLA	Ah. Hello - the back end of a very large, friendly cow...

ELLA BELLA	...very large, friendly, bull.

ELLA BELLA	...very large bullcow? I’ll go another way. 

ELLA BELLA	Uh-oh. I should have gotten an offroad bicycle.

ELLA BELLA	Johnny? Johnny? Can you hear me? 

ELLA BELLA	Johnny!! S.O.S.!!! Mayday.  HEEELP!

ELLA BELLA	Johnny, please help me! 

JOHNNY	Oi! Catch me if you can, Mr. Bull!

JOHNNY 	Grab your bike and run, Ella!

ELLA BELLA	Johnny! Get out of there now - he’s catching up!

ELLA BELLA	Bingo!

ELLA BELLA	This way Johnny! 

ELLA BELLA	Go Johnny, go!

ELLA BELLA	Are you hurt?

JOHNNY	I’m okay. 

ELLA BELLA	Your bike is ruined. 

JOHNNY	It doesn’t matter. It’s just a thing. My parents buy me a new thing every time we move. Next time I will probably get a bicycle with jet-engines.

ELLA BELLA	Well maybe they won’t have to buy you any more things. 

ELLA BELLA	Maybe you can stay here in Sunshine Gardens... with us.

JOHHNY	I’d like that.

ELLA BELLA	You should still swing the jetengine, if you can, though.

ELLA BELLA	Come on, let’s find Henry together. 

ELLA’S DAD	I’m sorry. We didn’t find Henry. 

LOTTIE	We looked everywhere. 

LISA 	The ice cream parlour... 

LOTTIE	...the ball pit... 

LISA	...the ghost house... 

JURGEN	And I found plenty of bumping beats at the dance class... but no Henry.

ALL	What????

JURGEN	Everybody knows childrens can’t resist a good beat. 

HENRY’S MOM	Thanks so much for looking, but he was with his Dad all day. 

HENRY	Sorry I ran off and put you to all that trouble.  

ELLA’S DAD	Don’t be.  It was actually a pretty fun outing.

LOTTIE	Ella will be so happy you’re back

HENRY	Yeah, so I can do her magic trick with her.

LISA	Well, yeah, but not just that - she was really worried about you!  

LISA	All she would talk about was how you´re her -

LISA	...best friend in the whole world.

HENRY	Really? 

MS. BERG	There’s Henry, but where are Johnny and Ella?

ELLA´S DAD 	They went to the tree house to find him, but they’ll come straight back after.

HENRY	OH, NO!!! 

HENRY 	I painted our names out in the tree house! What will Ella think?  She is going to hate me.

HENRY’S MOM	What have you done Henry?

HENRY	I’ve got to find her before she gets there! 

JURGEN	Climb on board, Henry. Let’s Rock n’ Roll!

JACKSON	I never thought I was going to see you guys again.

JACKSON	Have you found Henry?

JOHNNY	The Victor Supreme. 

ELLA BELLA	At least it means he was here. And he might still be!

HENRY	I know a short cut. 

JURGEN	El toro!

JURGEN	Ole! 

JURGEN	Are you ok?

HENRY	The tree house is that way!

JURGEN	Hold tight, Henry!

MR. JACKSON	Any sign of Henry!?

ELLA BELLA	He isn’t here.

JOHNNY	So he just ditched the bike I gave him and left?  Not cool.

MR. JACKSON	Oh, I’m sure he didn’t mean to.

MR. JACKSON	Ella Bella, what is it?

ELLA BELLA	How could he?

Mr. JACKSON	Henry must have been very upset. What was your fight about, Ella? 

JOHNNY	It was my fault.  I was jealous of Ella being such good friends  with Henry.  So I talked Henry into doing a bike stunt with me at the Circus, even though he was Ella’s partner... 

Mr. JACKSON	So you were fighting over Henry?

ELLA BELLA	I said to Henry if he didn’t do the magic with me...

ELLA BELLA	We wouldn’t be friends any more. 

ELLA BELLA	That’s not what a friend says is it?

MR. JACKSON	If I spoke to my chickens like that... heads would roll. 

EllA BELLA	I was so excited about the Circus I stopped being Henry’s friend. 

ELLA BELLA	Now I just wished I could say sorry.

ELLA BELLA	Henry!

ELLA BELLA	I’m so ashamed.  You were a better friend to Henry - and me!  I’ve ruined everything.  You win.

JOHNNY	Come on, Ella.  Just tell him you’re sorry!  Everything will be fine.  

ELLA BELLA	Are you sure.

JOHNNY	Of course.  You’re his best friend, no matter what!

ELLA BELLA	Henry... 

ELLA BELLA	I’ve been looking everywhere for you.

HENRY	I know. I... I’m sorry I painted over our heart.

ELLA BELLA	No!  It was all my fault!  I was jealous of Johnny and his cool stuff, and I was bossy and mean!  I shouldn’t have made you choose between us!  I’m sorry!  

ELLA BELLA	I don’t blame you if you don’t want to do the circus anymore at all, or if you just want to do the stunt with Johnny and don’t want to be my friend anymore, but..

HENRY	I want to do magic with you Ella. You’re my best friend in the whole world.  It’s you and me forever - you are the only one.  Noone is ever going to come between us.

ELLA BELLA	I never ever want to lose you again. 

HENRY	For ever.

ELLA BELLA	Ever and ever.

HENRY	You never will. So whaddya say, want to help me magically disappear?

ELLA BELLA	I thought you’d never ask.

HENRY	We better get going if we’re going to get to the Circus in time! 

ELLA BELLA	Wait a minute, what about Johnny? He’s been looking for you too.

ELLA BELLA	Where’s Johnny?

JACKSON	He is gone.

ELLA BELLA	Gone?  Gone where?

JACKSON	I didn’t ask. Maybe I should have asked?

ELLA BELLA	Maybe he headed back for the Circus already?

HENRY	Yeah... maybe.

JURGEN	Hurry up kids, the show must go on!

LISA	Come one, come all - the show’s about to start!

LOTTIE	Take your places everybody!

MR. JACKSON	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, babies and old folks and everyone in between, welcome to our spectacular Sunshine Circus!!!   To get things rolling, allow me to introduce our first act: the incredible Ms. Berg!

MR. JACKSON	Ms. Berg has a surprise for us today.  She gave me a few details...

MR. JACKSON	And that DEFINITELY wasn’t one of them!  Holy cow... 

MS. BERG	As you may know, I ran away with the circus in my younger days.  We traveled all over, performing for thousands and thousands! In Copacabana, I got this bikini and it still fits.

MR. JACKSON	Ahem...

MS. BERG	Oh right.  My number!

Johnny’s MOM	Johnny, are you sure you do not want to live here with your uncle and aunt?  I know they don’t cut the crust off your toast they way you like it, but...

JOHNNY	It´s not that.

Johnny’s MOM	I told them you don’t like crust.

Johnny	Mom!  It’s not about the crust.  Ella and Henry are best friends. I am only getting in the way. 

Johnny’s MOM	What makes you say that?

JOHNNY	I’ll get my bike and we can go.

JACKSON	I have to ask everyone to be very quiet.

RANDOM PERSON IN CROWD	What?

JACKSON	I SAID EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE QUIET.

MS. BERG	It didn’t seem so high back in Copacabana?

MS. BERG 	This is just like Copacabana.

MR. JACKSON	A nice big round of applause for Ms. Berg!  Bravo, bravo.

MS. BERG	Thank you!  Thank you!  You are my best audience ever.

MR. JACKSON	Next up we have the Fabulous Juggeling Twins, Lisa and Lottie!  

LOTTIE	It’s Lottie and Lisa.

ELLA BELLA	Where is Johnny?  He’s going to miss me making you disappear!  He can’t see you, if he’s not here.

HENRY 	I’m sure he’s fine.  What’s the worst that could h ave happened?

ELLA BELLA	Struck by lightening and eaten by a crocodile!

HENRY	Ella...


ELLA BELLA	You’re right.  I’m sure he’s just playing with some other friends.

HENRY	Oh Ella, I don´t think Johnny has any other friends. 

ELLA BELLA	Are you kidding?  Johnny has lots of friends!  Tons of friends - friends coming out his ears!  He’s always talking about them...

HENRY	But think - has he ever mentioned a single NAME?

ELLA BELLA	Of course!  There’s... well he’s always talking about... And I mean who could forget... hmm, no I guess he hasn’t.

HENRY	I think Johnny wanted us to think he had friends.  But every time he has moved house he had to start over agian.  We are Johnny´s only friends.

ELLA BELLA	Johnny doesn´t have any friends...?

ELLA´S DAD	The thrill of the spotlight awaits!

ELLA’s DAD	Wait.  The thrill of the spotlight is over here!

ELLA BELLA	I will be right back!

HENRY	Ella!  What about the show? Our disappearing act!

ELLA BELLA	Bingo.

ELLA BELLA	Johnny! Johnny! 

JOHNNY`S UNCLE	Yes, can I help you?

ELLA BELLA	I need... to talk...Johnny’s uncle Well, tell me what’s on your mind. I can heat up some meatloaf if

ELLA BELLA	Have you... seen...Johnny, where’s Johnny?

JOHNNY’S UNCLE	Whoa, easy there!  Johnny wanted to stay at his granny’s instead.  His mom and dad are taking him now...

ELLA BELLA	Johnny!

ELLA BELLA	Johnny!!

ELLA BELLA	Oh Johnny, I wish I could say I’m sorry. 

ELLA BELLA	Bingo! 

ELLA BELLA	Johnny, Johnny, can you hear me?

ELLA BELLA	Will you stay at Sunshine Garden and be my friend?  

ELLA BELLA	It was wrong of me to try keep Henry all to myself.  It’s just... Henry and I have been friends forever.  We know everything about each other.  You and I don’t know each other the same way...

ELLA BELLA	So let’s change that.  Right now.  My favorite food is peanut butter.

ELLA BELLA	I hate spiders.  I love the rain.  I once tried to do a handstand and ended up spraining my elbow.

ELLA BELLA	II don´t really know how to play Kung Fu Ninja.  But I want to learn.  And I have a best friend - but I want two...

MR. JACKSON	Thank you! Just a little something we whipped up. And now for my favourite act of Sunshine Circus. Give it up for the magical ELLA BELLA	and the fabulous Henry! 

MR. JACKSON	I said... the magical ELLA BELLA	and fabulous Henry! Henry and Ella? Anyone...?

CROWD	ELLA-BELLA-HENRY-ELLA-BELLA-HENRY!

MR. JACKSON	Uh... I uh... we..uh...

CROWD	ELLA-BELLA-HENRY-ELLA-BELLA-HENRY!

HENRY	Psss!  Mr. Jackson! 

MR. JACKSON	Oh Henry, thank goodness!  Did you find Ella Bella?

HENRY	Uh... no.


MR. JACKSON	Then why did you call me over???

HENRY	To tell you I haven´t found her yet.

LOTTIE	We could do our juggeling act again?

CROWD	ELLA-BELLA-HENRY-ELLA-BELLA-HENRY!

MR. JACKSON	She should be here any minute. Though preferably this minute. Do you, uh, have any idea where she went?

HENRY	Nope.

MR. JACKSON	I hate to say the show’s over folks...

MR. JACKSON	So I won’t!  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the magical ELLA BELLA and the fabulous Henry.  Finally.

ELLA BELLA	Hi, hello everybody.  I want to thank you all so much for coming.  And I really want to thank everyone who made my circus possible: Mr. Jackson, Lottie and Lisa...

LOTTIE	It’s Lottie and - wait, you got it!

ELLA BELLA	But the truth is, the circus did not turned out as magical as I was hoping.  I have ruined the great bicycle number by Johnny and Henry.  I was just thinking of myself and now Johnny’s moved away.  I wish I could use some magic to get him back, but my magic isn´t real and...

JOHNNY	Hocus Pocus!

ELLA BELLA	Johnny, you came back?!

JOHNNY	See, you can do real magic! 

ELLA BELLA	Give us a sec, Mr. Jackson.

JACKSON	Oh boy, oh boy!  This is gonna be the best act ever.

JACKSON	And now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, cats and dogs of all ages, I am proud to present...

JACKSON 	What am I proud to present?

ELLA BELLA	Bicycle Magic!

ELLA BELLA	And now for our final act.  Our most stunning and dangerous trick of all - especially because we, uh, haven’t practiced...

ELLA BELLA	The Forbidden Box of Mystery! ..yster...ystery...ysetery

ELLA BELLA	Hocus Pocus!!!

ELLA BELLA	Oh no, I’ve made my two best friends disappear! Henry, Johnny, where are you?

JACKSON	Oh, no, no!  They are gone!  They were here just a few seconds ago... Oh no, now we have to go on a search again.

JACKSON	Thank god!!!

JURGEN	Ay, carumba!

JOHNNY’S DAD	He’s just like his Dad!

ELLA'S DAD	That's my girl.

JURGEN	Let’s party!

JOHNNY	Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

HENRY	Yeah.  The only thing better than having one best friend...

ELLA BELLA	Is having two best friends.
