YOUNG VICK	Alright salmon, here I come. 

VICK SR.	Take a look Victor. 

CROWDS	Here they come./Watch ‘em go!/Look at them jump. 

YOUNG VICK/VICK SR.	Round the bend, upstream swim. Find your way back home again. 

YOUNG VICK/VICK SR.	Round the bend, upstream swim. Find your way back home again.

YOUNG VICK	Round the bend, upstream swim. Find your way back home again. Dad, so the fish are gonna have babies?

VICK SR.	Mmmhmm. They’re about to spawn.

YOUNG VICK	Spawn? Stop, that tickles.

VICK SR.	Hey, look here. It’s for you.

YOUNG VICK	A flashlight? Thank you, dad! Hooray. Now I can find my way even in the dark!

RADIO	When the world famous Wusuli River is filled with salmon that have swam miles upstream to spawn, the people in surrounding towns line the shores by the hundreds to cheer them on, yelling, “Welcome back”! These fish are believed to bring good luck to all who witness this wondrous sight. Locals believe that the hardships these fish go through to start a family, bless the families that attend the migration. (Fading out) In other news, two bear dressed as nurses were seen leaving a nearby hospital…  

VICK	Hehehe. Perfect! Experiment 99… Begin! Experiment… Fail. What am I doing wrong? Maybe I should take a break. (sigh) Huh…? That’s strange. I know I heard something B-Briar? Bramble?

BRAMBLE	Hi! (Falls)

VICK	No! Briar, you’re crazy.

BRIAR	I’m ending this right now? 

VICK	What are you talking about?

BRIAR	What the…There’s no use playing dumb. 

BRAMBLE	We’re on to you, buddy.  

BRAMBLE	We can’t let you finish building this logging machine!

VICK	Everyone stop!  

BRAMBLE	Do you think that was too hard? 

BRIAR	Oh, he’ll be fine. Ahh.

VICK	Wait, it’s not for logging, its Tesla’s Gigantor Ray.  


BRAMBLE	Gi-whaaa?

BRIAR	Did he say…Tresstle?

SEYMORE ODD	Wrong. It’s pronounced Tesla. Nikola Tesla.

VICK	Sounds important.

SEYMORE ODD	Oh very. He invented the alternating current system when he was only 30. Then the he invented the Tesla Coil, remote X-Ray technology. Torpedoes. But he didn’t stop there. His greatest invention was… The Gigantor Ray. Here. The schematic. Just think about it friend.  With this machine, a bun turns into a loaf. One egg could make a whole omelet. There’s more. A stick becomes a tree.   It’s too good to be true! 

VICK	I’ll take it! So… Now do you believe me? I didn’t get it for logging. 

BRIAR&BRAMBLE	We believe you.  

VICK	Humph! What a waste of time. (eats) Hello? Mom.Oh yeah, I got the pants you sent me alright. I’m wearing them now. You gotta stop worrying about me. You got enough to handle with dad. Say what? Dad’s coming here?

VICK	Um hi. So uh, how was the ride—eh?

VICK SR.	Victor! It’s been too long. How are you son? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I brought you a few knick knacks from back home. Boiled eggs. They’re from my own roost, you know? They’re really big this year. What else we got? Hair growth stuff. Some cold medicine from your mother.

VICK	Dad, this is for kids. 

VICK SR.	Is it? Well you know your mother. You’re her boy. Shampoo, corn, gloves Mushrooms, toilet paper, hair-brush, apples, thermos, more corn, and a jacket. And this is Mikey. Hahaha. 

VICK	Dad, I’m just gonna lock up the truck. You probably need some rest. 

VICK SR.	Uh huh. You’re probably right. 

VICK SR.	(Singing) I love cooking in the kitchen, I love cooking in the kitchen, I love cooking in the kitchen I do. I love cooking in the kitchen, I love cooking in the kitchen, I love cooking in the kitchen for you. Haha. Yeah. Nearly ready. (Singing) I love cooking, I do. Victor’s going to love this. Hehe, This’ll put some meat on his bones. Good morning. Days a-wasting!

VICK	Wow. My favorite. 

VICK SR.	Victor, come and take a break. 

VICK	What? Dad, what’s for dinner?

VICK SR.	I’ll be right there. 

RECORDING	And deep breath into a lunge. Nice!    

VICK SR.	Mikey, you’re making this harder than it has to be. Get back here. I need you for my chicken and mushroom stew. Whoa, I’m sorry. Victor! Up and at’em Vick. Time for lunch, Vick! Victor, let’s play. It’s bedtime. Victor, the salmon are coming.

VICK SR.	Hmm. What’s this? Huh? (Reading the note that says (Dad Keep Out)) Why you little—get back here! (Panting) Victor? Hm, where is that boy? What a pig sty. Whoa, uh.

VICK	(Singing off screen) I am such a great scientist. My inventions are too many to list. If I can get this thing to work, I’ll be the next Tesla. Doo dah Doo dah wah. Dad?! What are you doing

VICK SR.	Victor, there you are. (Trips) No!! The Tesla Ray! Where did it go? The Gigantor Ray. It just can’t be gone. No. This can’t be happening. All that time and money, gone. Because of you.

VICK SR.	Victor. I was just trying to help out and clean your lab a little bit. It was dirty and…then there was the chicken—and then there was a door—no no no no…Oh. Hey. I brought you something here.Do you remember this old thing? Can you believe it? I got it all fixed up for you. What the…There we go. You see? Just like old times.

VICK	Why would I want that?

VICK SR.	I’m sorry…I just thought that uhh ---
VICK	Stop it! What did I like as a kid? Do you even know? No, no. Don’t answer. It doesn’t matter. Look, you just show up out of the blue, and what? You just start kicking balls and making stews and everythings ok? Well, you get what you want. But what about what I want? Me? My dreams, my passions…You know nothing about me! Do you? (Punches the air) Oh, you haven’t changed. And you never will. Will you please just go away?

VICK	(Deep breath) Ahhhh. What did I sit on?

BRIAR	Catch anything?

BRAMBLE	No. We’ve been here for days and still no fish.

BRIAR	That’s strange, there should tons of salmon migrating this time of year. 

BRAMBLE	What if we don’t get any fish? I guess I could become a vegetarian. But fish is just too tasty!

PHONE	Host: On today’s program we are honored and pleased to have with us legendary translator and poet, Ronald Atkinson. Ronald what do you have for us today?

BRIAR	Hide! This is a poem written by Du Mu, a poet from the Tang Dynasty. Winding up the rocky mountain path in cold mountain far. Homesteads unveiled in the floating white clouds.

BETH	Hi sweetie. I’m at Pine Tree Mountain now. There’s something going on with the salmon’s migration path. The river must be blocked. (Affirmative emote) I’ve got a few leads. Could be illegal waste dumping. I’m checking it out. (In the background) I miss you too. It’s so beautiful here. 

BRAMBLE	Briar, who is that? She’s so skinny. She looks like a noodle.  

BRIAR	Have you thought maybe you’re just…too big.

BRAMBLE	What?! That’s just more to love. 

BRIAR&BRAMBLE	Vick’s logging!

VICK	Briar and Bramble, you have no idea what’s up. There you are. Why you little punk! Who do’ya think you are? Here. Let me help you get out of here!

BRIAR	Step away from the trees, Vick!

BRAMBLE	 Yeah. Or else, you’ll have to deal with us.

VICK	You two have been a thorn in my side for years, but that stops right now. Hehehe, It’s time to cut you two down to size! Now behold the shrink ray of doom. Say cheese. (Flashback) I’m sure you’re wondering how I got such a dangerous weapon within my grasp.   With my super strong observation skills, I realized the magnifier got shrunk.  It turned out that machine Seymore Odd sold me was not a “magnifier.” Instead, it was a ~ Shrinking Machine! I’m gonna sort him out later... He didn’t even know what he was selling! Just as I was about to throw it away, I noticed the flashlight on the ground… And all of a sudden, an idea just came to my mind! With my brilliant talent for making things, And my one of a kind creativity. I combined the two devices into one… (dramatic emote) And so, the enhanced, super powerful, undefeatable, all-time best… “Shrinking machine” …was created! (Maniacal laughing) 

BRAMBLE	Briar, I think Vick’s lost his mind.

VICK	(Start Offscreen) Briar and Bramble. The game is over!

BRAMBLE	Bro, what’s he gonna do? 

VICK	Get small!

BRAMBLE	Is that it?

VICK	No no no. Stay right there please. Give it a second. It’ll work. What the-It needs a shake… Oh come on. Why won’t you work ? 

BRIAR	Let’s go. Its’s go new batteries. Hang on…Wait a sec…

BRIAR	Don’t let him get away!

BRAMBLE	Vick, stop!

BRIAR	Vick, stop!

BRAMBLE	Nowhere to run, Vick! Try to shrink me will ya?! HOI!! Huh? Well, I could shrink a little. 

BRIAR	Whoa! 

VICK	Oh no. The flashlight.

BRAMBLE	That’s what you get. For trying to cut down our trees! 

VICK	No no. Let me go!!

BRIAR	Where do you think you’re going?

VICK	You don’t understand! Let me go. Please! Or we’re all going to shrink. You don’t know what you’re doing. 

BRIAR
You hear that Bramble? He’s going to shrink us!

VICK	You gotta let me go. Wait! You don’t know what you’re doing. Come on. We’re all going to shrink. We have to run! No!

VICK SR,	Time for lunch, Victor. Where is he? Victor? Victor!

BRAMBLE	Briar… Briar…?

BRIAR	Where are we?

BRAMBLE	(Shuttering) Earthquake! Earthquake! Look at that!

BRIAR	Bramble!

BRAMBLE	Ahh, You’re a little cutie, aren’t you?

BRIAR	Strange.

BRAMBLE	Aw. You’re like a giant squishy gummy bear. I could just eat you up. Where’d you come from?
Hey Briar, come check it out!

VICK	What is that thing?

BRIAR	Vick, wake up!

BRIAR&BRAMBLE	Babu?

BABU	King Tiki! King Tiki! Hehe. King Tiki. You’ll never guess what I found. 

BUBU	See? It’s a little birdie. 

TIKI	What is wrong with you? Focus! This is it. We must hurry. 

BRIAR	Come on, Vick. Wake up! You! Start talking now. What happened to us? 

VICK	Huh? We got shrunk! (screams) We’re going to get stepped on. We’re going to get devoured!

BRIAR&BRAMBLE	Did he say/We got shrunk?

VICK	Hey, I told you to let me go. This is on you!

BRIAR
Wait, what’s going on? 

BRAMBLE	Haha. Oh, Vick. You had us going there. Yup. The truth is… this is all some kind of… trick, right?
Fess up. This is just some hi-tech tricky thing, to make us feel craaaaazy. Ahh?“So scared! Run away!”
Then when we’re gone… that’s when you’ll come in…And cut down our trees! Hehehehe… I’m onto you. You can’t trick- (scared emote) Ok, well… that’s a good trick…

LOGGER VICK	Hey! If this is just an illusion, Bramble, stop running!

BRAMBLE	Okay, you win! I believe you! 

BRIAR	No time for that. How do we change back?

LOGGER VICK	Yeah! You two distract it. I’ll find the flashlight! 

BRIAR	Deal! 

BRIAR	Bramble, follow me! 

BRAMBLE	Coming! 

BRIAR/BRAMBLE	Yoohoo! Hey frog face, over here! C’mon, greenie! Catch us if you can. 

LOGGER VICK	I found it!

TIKI	Light of the sun, shine on my crown.

TIKI	Making it strong. 

BABU	It’s happening. King Tiki, I don’t think it worked. 

TIKI	My ritual is perfect! It cannot fail. What!? How is this possible?! I didn’t do anything wrongly. You! It must’ve been that bird of yours! Oh yeah! Hooah! It’s a trap.

VICK SR.	Victor! Victor! Victor! Where are you? 

VICK SR.	Dad! I’m over here! I’m over here! Dad! Dad!

BRIAR	Come on! 

VICK SR.	Victor! 

VICK	Dad! I’m here! I’m right here! Don’t go! I’m here! I’m here!

BRAMBLE	Hey, Vick’s dad! Come back. Dad-guy. 

VICK SR.	Victor! Victor! Please come back. 

VICK	Dad! 

VICK	t’s over. 

BRAMBLE	Briar, this is still a trick, right? 

BRAMBLE	Great job, Vick. You just couldn’t mind your own business, could you? You just had to cut down our trees… And now you made us miss lunch, and dinner, and dessert. We’re so tiny. We can’t even fight a frog. What am I supposed to do about food, huh Vick? Answer me that, Vick. It’s always something with you…

LOGGER VICK	When is he gonna stop that? Come on! 

BRIAR	Don’t mind him. He’s just hungry. He’ll be fine when he gets some food in him. 

BRIAR	Hey Vick, you and your dad. You two okay? 

LOGGER VICK	He meddles in my life. It’s complicated, okay, Briar? He’s always pushing me and setting me up on dates. Like I even need the help. He’s just trying to live my life for me. No matter what, I’ve never been good enough for him. I just wanna be my own man. I even put a note on the door. Huh? What’s all this?

BRAMBLE	Just leave me here. I can’t go on.

BRIAR	This was cut with something razor sharp.We better stick together.Bramble?

BRAMBLE	I smell candy. It’s… Chocolate!! Huh? Ahhh!

BRIAR/LOGGER VICK	Bramble! Bramble. Behind me!

LONG CLAW	Well hello there. You boys must be lost. Don’t get many uninvited guests here…Who survive. Tonight’s your lucky night. I’m afraid my dance card’s all filled up. This is where you run! 

BRIAR	Go, we’re fine. Vick, let’s go. 

LOGGER VICK	Here, let me help you get out of here! 

LONG CLAW	Wait. I know you!

LOGGER VICK	Whatever you’re thinking, it wasn’t me!

BRIAR	Stay back!

LOGGER VICK	What the- 

LONG CLAW	Oh, it’s you, alright. Ugly little bald man. Now that I’ve got you here, just the two of us, let me ask you a question. Who’s the punk now?

LOGGER VICK	Bramble, Bramble. 

BRAMBLE	What happened?

BRIAR	Watch out! 

BRAMBLE	That egg is fighting the bug.

SHADOW SHELL	We’ve known one another for quite a while, Long Claw. Pay me the respect of not holding back. 

LONG CLAW	Hahaha. With glee.

SHADOW SHELL	Then let us continue. 

LONG CLAW	After you! 

SHADOW SHELL	Your old tricks won’t work this time. 

LONG CLAW	You haven’t seen the last of me!

SHADOW SHELL	Hello everyone. Forgive the unpleasantness. Well met my friends. I’m the legendary grass Knight, Shadow Shell. Hello Vick, Bear Brothers. It is my great honor to finally meet you. 

BRIAR/BRAMBLE/LOGGER VICK	Huh? 

LOGGER VICK	How do you know us?

SHADOW SHELL	Your names echo through this forest far and wide. But I am curious how you’ve come to be like this. 

SHADOW SHELL	A shrinking machine? I have never seen this before. Then truly, you are in a pickle. 

LOGGER VICK	That’s right. Can you take us home? 

BRIAR	The sooner we get back, the better. 

SHADOW SHELL	Let’s see…Yes. I think I can help you.

LOGGER VIC	Really? We’re saved. We’re saved! Briar, we can finally go home!

SHADOW SHELL	Before this journey I do want to replenish my strength with a bit of chocolate.  

BRAMBLE	That was good. (Burps)

SHADOW SHELL	Farewell. 

LOGGER VICK	No no no, wait, Shadow Shell, I’ve got chocolate at my house. I’ll give it all to you. Shadow Shell!

SHADOW SHELL	As a Knight of the Grass, I must help those in need. 

LOGGER VICK	Hey, thank you.

LOGGER VICK	So tell us, Shadow Shell. Where did you learn to use Kung Fu like that? So cool! (Kung fu sounds) You flew in like a lightning strike and saved that day. That mantis never stood a chance. You were incredible.

SHADOW SHELL	(Chuckles) I just did what anyone would do. Of course, I do have a weakness.  

BRAMBLE	Weakness? Wow. What weakness? 

SHADOW SHELL	To be honest, every time I see a full moon, you see… Well, never mind. 

BRAMBLE	Full moon? Like that?

LOGGER VIC	Shelly? You can come out now okay? Shelly, this isn’t funny anymore!

LOGGER VICK/BRAMBLE	Wake up! 

LOGGER VICK	You happy? This is your fault, Bramble.

SHADOW SHELL	Well I suppose you’ve seen my weakness now, the full moon. My apologies. 

BRAMBLE	Shadow Shell, what kind of bird are you? And how come you’re still in your egg?

SHADOW SHELL	Oh, I’m no bird. In fact… I’m a grasshopper. This hummingbird’s eggshell acts as my armor. 

BRAMBLE	That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever heard!

VICK	Guys look, we made it. 

LOGGER VICK	Dad! Dad. Where are you? Strange. Where could he be?

BRIAR	Hey Vick, we found a note. 

LOGGER VICK	A note…Dear Vick, I was hoping to talk to you before I returned home—huh?

VICK SR.	But you didn’t come back last night. I don’t blame you. You were right. I should have respected your space, but more importantly, I should have respected you as a man. I’ve prepared dinner for you. Your favorite. It’s in the fridge. I left you a nightcap. Your mom made it for you. Try and remember to get plenty of rest. The ladies don’t like bags under your eyes. I’m kidding. Sort of. Vick, it’s been years since you’ve been home. Your mother and I miss you. So much. We will always be there when you need us. Until then, goodbye. Love, Dad. 

SHADOW SHELL	Are you alright? 

LOGGER VICK	I pushed my dad away. 

BRAMBLE	What about that there? You’re standing on a sentence.

LOGGER VICK	(Reads the note) PS I’ll take the flashlight back.  

BRIAR	He took it back? 

LOGGER VICK	Oh no. 

BETH	‘Scuse me. You look a little down. Everything will work out. Confucius says, “In the end, all things must bend.” Oh, I’m so sorry.

VICK SR.	It’s fine. It’s fine. Actually, the quote is, “all things will mend.” And it’s not Confucius. 

BETH	Ooh. I’m still learning. 

VICK SR.	Yeah, me too. Are you here visiting family?  
Beth ? 

BETH	Hi, my name is Beth. I’m a marine biology major.  I'm studying what's going on with the salmon here.

LOGGER VICK	There is only one train today for Stillwater and it’s at ten past five. And it’s already 1! 

BRIAR	We need to go. There’s still time.

LOGGER VICK	It’s impossible. Look at us, Briar. We can’t possibly make it there on time. 

BRIAR	You’re giving up?

BRAMBLE	It’s not fair. We’re going to be stuck tiny forever. How am I gonna get honey from the hive with these tiny paws?!

SHADOW SHELL	Worry not my friends. Where there’s chocolate, nothing is impossible for Shadow Shell.   

LOGGER VICK	The train station.

BRAMBLE	Yeah, we made it! I’ll be big and beautiful again in no time! 

LOGGER VICK	Shadow Shell, you saved us. I don’t know what we would’ve done without you. 

SHADOW SHELL	Don’t mention it.About that…chocolate…

LOGGER VICK	Of course! I’ll make you a chocolate mountain.  

SHADOW SHELL	Ah, you honor me. 

BRAMBLE	You’re not gonna fall asleep on us again like yesterday, are you? 

LOGGER VICK	Bramble, zip it. 

SHADOW SHELL	It’s fine, it’s fine. Besides, it’s the middle of the day-huh?

LOGGER VICK	What do we do now?

BRAMBLE	I don’t know. Can you fly a pigeon?

LOGGER VICK	Me? (Bramble nods) I guess it’s just like riding a horse, right? 

LOGGER VICK	Hyaa!

BRAMBLE	(Screaming)

LOGGER VICK	(Screaming)

CROWDS	(Crowd noises)

CROWD	What was that?!/It’s a bird!

LOGGER VICK/BRIAR/BRAMBLE	(Falling emotes) (Crash emotes)

LOGGER VICK	(Nasal) This is annoying.

BRAMBLE	Um… hey guys.

LOGGER VICK	Don’t eat me. Don’t eat me! 

BRAMBLE	Don’t eat me. I’m not a gummy bear! 

MOBILE PHONE SPEAKER	Whoa, sorry you lost! Wanna play again?!

CLEANING WOMAN	Anyone lose a baby?

MOM	Come on, come on, high score! Yes! Huh? Where’s the baby? 

LOGGER VICK/BRIAR/BRAMBLE	(Screams) Help!/Can anyone hear us?

BRAMBLE	Briar, what is this stuff? It feels like weird sticky spaghetti.

BRIAR	(Sighs) We’re stuck.

LOGGER VICK	This is it. There’s no way we’re gonna catch that train now. Huh? Very large big hairy spider coming this way! Help me, save me!

BUBBA	Hyaa!

BRAMBLE	So cool. 

LOGGER VICK	Boy, we’re glad to see you.

SHADOW SHELL	He too is a warrior.

PIERRE	As you wish. 

BRAMBLE	Oh, right there. That tickles. 

PIERRE	Is this better, Warrior Bramble?

BRAMBLE	Oh, that’s perfect.

BRIAR	Hey Vick, what’s wrong? Worried about the shrink ray?

VICK	I suppose so. 

SHADOW SHELL	Or, are you worried about the way you left things with your father?

VICK	How do you know that?

SHADOW SHELL	(Pointing) Him.

BRAMBLE	I mean all his dad did was cook for him every day and play his favorite games. And what did he do? He just yelled at him. Can you imagine? They’re not very close at all.

VICK	Bramble is right. It used to be different. We were inseparable. He got promoted at work and was busy. After that, we just started talking less and less. I remember the good times, but mostly the bad. 

BRAMBLE	You need a hug. 

VICK	No I’m okay. 

BRAMBLE	I never knew your childhood was so lonely.  

EUGENE	Gentleman I give you, Pipesburg. 

PIERRE	Everything flows to and from Pipesburg. This is how we get you home. 

VICK	Wow, it’s beautiful. Pierre, how exactly do we get outta here?

BRAMBLE	Bananas!

PIERRE	Well that’s the thing. We HAD a machine that could fly us anywhere we wanted. It worked like magic. We called it…Dr. One. 

VICK	You mean a drone? Great! Where is it?

PIERRE	The Fly Gang stole it from us and now their boss has it. He’s taken everything from us. Now we’re forced into a life of crime.

BRIAR	That’s terrible. Who’s their boss?

PIERRE	He is a golden haired buzzard. Goes by the name…Tricky Boo.

VICK	Uh, how do we get your drone back? 

PIERRE	Well since you ask…We fight!

BRIAR	They’re catching up!  

TRICKY BOO	You’ll be sorry you crossed old Tricky. After them! 

BRAMBLE/BRIAR	Yeah!

BRAMBLE	We were too late. Now we’ll never turn back to normal. 

BRIAR	Don’t worry. We’ll think of something else.


VICK	Dad. Huh, that looks like my dad’s chicken.

YOUNG VICK	(All off-screen) Dad promised to fix the kite for me. But he went to the forest again. Humph, whatever. I don’t believe him anymore. 

YOUNG VICK	I don’t want to hang out with dad anymore. 

YOUNG VICK	I don’t want a dad like this anymore.

VICK SR. 	(Offscreen) Come on, Vick. Let’s go fly the kite. (Offscreen) I made you a swing. (Offscreen) Hey Victor, let’s go play ball  (Offscreen) Do you wanna go to the amusement park? (Offscreen) Victor, get up! (Offscreen) It’s time for bed!

VICK FLASHBACK	(Can copy from earlier) Why would I want that?! What did I like as a kid? My dreams, my passions, you know nothing about me! Will you please just go away?

VICK	I’m sorry... I’m sorry Dad. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have said those things. I shouldn’t have let you go. Please come back to me. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I’m a bad son. Please forgive me.

VICK	Dad!! 

VICK SR.	My son, I am so sorry. I didn’t have time for you when you were young. 

VICK SR.	Excuse me, excuse me... excuse me. 

FEMALE TRAIN STAFF	The train is about to leave. Hey sir! 

VICK SR. THINKING	I may have missed out on your childhood, but I’m not gonna make that mistake again! 

VICK SR.	So that’s what happened eh? No wonder the girl was so huge. What should we do next huh? 

VICK	We need to find the flashlight. Let’s hope Lady Luck’s on our side. 

VICK SR.	But it’ll be like finding a needle in a haystack son.

VICK SR.	Victor, what’s that river down there? 

VICK	Well, there’s only one river near Pine Tree Mountain. 

VICK SR.	Oh no. It’s time for the salmon to start migrating. 

VICK	Hey, where you going? 

VICK	Hey, what’s the matter dad? 

VICK SR.	Look. 

VICK	Salmon! 

VICK SR.	And all that garbage is blocking their way. 

VICK	Who could do such a thing? 

DANNY	You still ain’t fixed it? Get up. Let me try. You’re taking too long. 

DINO	The stink, I can’t handle it... It’s too much for me. Huh. Eh! 

DANNY	You better learn. We’re making a fortune off this. 

DINO	But why the river, Danny?

DANNY	Where else we gonna dump? In your bedroom?!

VICK	They’re dumping illegally in the water. 

DANNY	Come on. Let’s just dump this garbage and leave. 

DINO	Alright, alright. 

VICK  SR.	C’mon son, we’ve got to stop them!

VICK	Dad, hold on. Don’t you think we’re a little bit small? How could we stop them?

VICK SR.	Listen… The salmon need to overcome many difficulties during their migration each year… They spare no effort to swim upstream. They come back here once a year, when autumn comes and the leaves turn red.

VICK	I know but…

VICK SR.	But nothing. We cannot succeed if we don’t try, Victor. And we have to try our best now.

VICK	You’re right dad, but we’re gonna have to hurry.

BETH	I’ve left my phone in the truck. Good thing. I’ve got them now.

DINO	That selfie’s not bad. I’m so pretty I could kiss myself.

DINO	Oh man! A pretty girl left a comment on my picture! I better take another. Hehe. Ah!

DANNY	Dino! What are you doing up there?

DINO	Oh. Sorry, sorry. What… what was that? I didn’t touch nothin’. 

DINO	Huh? What is wrong with this stupid truck?

DINO	Ah! What the heck’s that? Whoa!
