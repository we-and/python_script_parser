Joy	i guess so. so hey, why don’t you tell me what’s going on in there?

officer Crowley	well, the teenage kid took off last night. 

Joy	zack. wait, are you sure?

officer Crowley	yeah he left a note. but don’t worry, most kids make their own way back. and, we are on it.

Rod	joy!

Joy	sorry. 

Rod	what was that about?

Joy	zack hockstatter ran away from home.

Rod	oh, so you risk getting a cold or some awful virus running around in your underwear?

Joy	no i just, i saw the police car so i figured i would go see what was going on.

Rod	it doesn’t surprise me that kid ran off. that boy has a hateful look on his face, day and night.

Joy	don’t say that, okay? he does not. he is funny, and and, he is smart, and he;s nice, sometimes… it hasn’t been that easy for him since his mom died.

Rod	joy where is this coming from?

Joy	i just don’t think it’s right to say mean things about people.

Rod	what is it marcie? what’s wrong marcie?

Marcie	eve has run away! she left a note.

Rod	what?

Joy	shh! hey, no no, bite the ball, we don’t know each other.

Rod	crazy dog really seems to like you.

Bob	hey… i’m sorry im staring… there’s something so familiar about you. 

Joy	i um, i;m your next door neighbour. 

Bob	no that’s not it at all, i got it, it’s your eyes. you see that she’s got my big brother’s eyes.

Joy	uncle timmy.

Bob	yeah… how’d you know that?

Rod	we heard that your son zack was missing. 

Bob	do you know where he is?

Marcie	hardly.

Rod	our oldest daughter eve dissappeared last night too.

Bob	huh, well, maybe they ran off together?

Rod	we think that your son abduscted our daughter.

Bob	excuse me?

Rod	you heard me right.

Bob	my son doesn’t even know your daughter! i mean, he’s homeschooled, he barely leaves the house.

Joy	what, he’s homeschooled? that’s why i never saw him at roosevelt…

Miles	zack and eve have been facetiming each other for months. they even have codenames. he’s darth vader, and she’s lizzie borden.

Marcie	you see?

Bob	okay, but that doesn’t mean he abdusted her.

Joy	you know, maybe it’s like romeo and juliet?

Bob	right there. 

Rod	i was thinking more like natural born killers. 

Marcie	oh that’s eve’s favorite movie… 

Bob	okay. alright. so let’s say that they did run off with each other. did she leave a note?

Joy	actually uh—

Rod	we didn’t come here to be interrogated. we came here for information.

Marcie	show us your son’s room. ther’ve gotta be some clues.

Rod	yeah. 

Bob	okay. uh, come on up through here.

Rod	ugh, i can hardly wait. 

Bob	bit of a mess… 

Rod	“a bit” of a mess?

Bob	little bit…

Rod	ugh…

Miles	relax…

Bob	i wouldn’t lean too heavy on that, that’s ready to come down.

Rod	really bob?

Bob	yup. yup. now uh, keep in mind we’re behind on housekeeping.

Joy	it’s okay.

Marcie	ahhhh!

Bob	oh, uh… 

Joy	what is going on in there?

Bob	yeah, yeah, it’s, it’s okay, they’re harmless. y’know, friendly actually…

Miles	they’re labrats. we raise them for money.

Joy	my room…

Marcie	ugh…

Bob	yeah… uh, see i got uh, laid off from the ad agency last year and so uh, we do this for the university, brings in a little bit of extra cash.

Miles	i wanted to raise llamas but they’re too big.

Rod	what?

Bob	thanks miles, that’s good. alright, uh, yeah, and uh, here’s zack’s room, go ahead, feel free to… 

Joy	what the hell… 

Miles	his favorite band is satan’s sandals.

Bob	miles!

Marcie	get me out of here!

Bob	alright, uh, come over any time! 

Marcie	this hurts! you’ll hear from my lawyer!

Bob	it’s the eyes… 

Bob	miles…

Joy	i still don’t see why i can’t help find eve?

Rod	there’s nothing you could do. plus, athletes need to be in school, or they can’t play. you know that.

Joy	yeah. 

Rod	now, i’ve gotta take your mother to the hospital for x-rays. what, we’ve talked to the lawyers.

Joy	come on, do you have to file a second lawsuit? they don’t look like they have deep pockets.
	
Rod	worst case scenario we force them into bankruptcy and they move. uh, best case scenario, they have good insurance, we collect a bundle of cash, and we move. either way, we’re no longer neighbors. 

Joy	i just don’t get why we all can’t get along… feel better mom. 

Marcie	ohh thank you honey. ohh…

Rod	honey it can’t be that bad…

Marcie	it’s so bad…
