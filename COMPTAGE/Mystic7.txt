ISSIE	This maniac with a trailer, he nearly ran me over.

DAN	Could be a horse rustler.

NATASHA	Where are they? This, herd?

ISSIE	They were here. But they’ve gone now.

CAROLINE	Hey Issie, we could get our Dad’s drone. Fly it over the forest.

ISSIE	That would be amazing.

CAROLINE	Can you tell the future? Are we gonna win cross country trials?

NATASHA	No way. Trust Dulmoth Park to have a water jump.

DAN	It’s ok. We’ve got Caroline.

CAROLINE	I’m ok, but my shoulder.

ISSIE	What about your internship?

TOM	He’s got one more chance, next Saturday.

CAROLINE	That’s the Cross-Country Trials. We can’t enter without five riders. Issie could do it?

ISSIE	I am not ready for this.

CAROLINE	Hello. Where are you horses? Horses? Hello?

CALEB	If the wild herd are here, we’ll find them. I made like a grid map around the swim hole and we can cross reference it back against the… Caroline, Caroline.

CALEB	Alright, hand it over. You can’t steer it with one hand.

CAROLINE	Arghh. Why do forests have to have so many trees?

CALEB	Here. Give it.

CAROLINE	Don’t, ow.

CALEB	Give it.

CAROLINE	Don’t. You’re not the boss of me, stop.

CALEB	Kill it.

CALEB	That is so broken.

CAROLINE	It’s not broken, it’s just, sprained. Oh, right, the drone.

CALEB	Maybe we can salvage the footage. If we’re still alive.

CAROLINE	‘cause Dad’ll kill us when he finds out we’ve destroyed his drone.

CALEB	Tom might kill us first if he finds out you hurt your shoulder right before Cross-Country Trials.

CAROLINE	So many people who want to kill us, yay.

CALEB	Come on.

MITCH	Here she is.

AMANDA	How are you feeling about today?

MITCH	Fine.

AMANDA	What are you looking for?

ISSIE	My gloves.

MITCH	Toast?

AMANDA	Or porridge?

MITCH	Buckwheat pancake?

ISSIE	Ugh. Please, stop listing food.

AMANDA	Are you really feeling ok? About today?

ISSIE	Yeah.

MITCH	Here.

MITCH	Black tourmaline. It’s for protection.

ISSIE	Why would I need protection?

AMANDA	Mum, she’ll be fine.

MITCH	She will now.

ISSIE	Yeah. Yeah, I’ll be fine.

AMANDA	Yeah, well that’s still got the…

ISSIE	Mmm hmm, yep, I got that.

MITCH	Do you think she needs her chakras realigned?

AMANDA	Oh, please just let me be in the room when you suggest that one.

ANNOUNCER	Kia ora, good morning ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Dulmoth Park Area, Cross Country Trials. Would all trainers please make their way to the Steward desk to register the attendants. All trainers, please register your teams if you haven’t already. Thank you.

ANNOUNCER	The course will be open for walking in five minutes.

ISSIE	Hey, any luck with the drone?

CALEB	I dunno yet. It kinda crashed.

CAROLINE	Yeah.

ISSIE	What?

CALEB	I’ll try and salvage the footage.

CAROLINE	Ahh.

NATASHA	It’s your shoulder, isn’t it?

CAROLINE	It’ll be ok.

NATASHA	We’ve already lost Dan, you’re hurt and Issie’s gonna be way out of her depth.

ISSIE	Ah, standing right here.

CALEB	Ignore her.

STELLA	What she means is, thanks for stepping in.

NATASHA	Yeah, exactly, and don’t worry, in cross country your team always drops the lowest score from the board, so, your points won’t even count.

ISSIE	Again. Thanks Natasha for your vote of confidence.

TOM	Alright you lot, I’ve got the running order here. Caleb and Natasha, you’re in pre-training, so you’re up first, then there’s the training class, which is you Caroline. Issie and Stella, you’re in intro, so…

NATASHA	I’m sorry, pre-training? I just, I thought I’d be moving up to training by now.

TOM	Oh, did you? And I thought I’d be married to someone really rich and famous, but we’ll both have to deal with the disappointment, ok? Let’s go.

ISSIE	You and me Blaze. Team KP.

STELLA	Issie, come on, course walk.

TOM	Issie, that’s the start box.

STELLA’S MUM	Stel.

NATASHA	What is this? The rugby world cup?

STELLA	The game. Hi Mum.

ISSIE	Look who came.

CAROLINE	Even Hamish.

CALEB	He’ll feel at home here, being a show pony himself.

HAMISH	Stel. Did we miss kick off already?

STELLA	That’s not what they call it.

ISSIE	Ok. Officially freaking out now.

NATASHA	I know, right? You should see how huge the rest of the course is.

ISSIE	Seriously?

TOM	No. Not seriously. Stop winding her up.

CALEB	You don’t even have to jump this one Issie. Look, it’s got a red square. That means it’s a training level fence.

STELLA	Red equals training, blue equals pre-training.

CALEB	And you and Stel are intro level, the white squares.

NATASHA	Look, for the teeny, tiny ones. That’s you.

ISSIE	Caleb, why has this got a white square on it when you said that I’m white squares. Yeah, have I got something wrong here, this is massive.

CALEB	Well you don’t jump the water, you ride through it.

STELLA	Plus, water’s a black flag.

ISSIE	A what?

CALEB	A black flag means when a jump in the course is really tough for your level, they’ll give the rider a choice.  Look, you can ride it like this.

CALEB	Straight through here.  Find your stride.  And up and out, over this log.  To get home faster.

STELLA	Or. What you’ll do, is go through the water, to the side, still in between the flags, canter up the bank, which is the other option.

ISSIE	So why would anyone jump out if they didn’t have to?

CALEB	To save time.

NATASHA	Don’t worry about it, only the top four scores matter.

ISSIE	So you keep telling me.

TOM	Alright, the course splits here, I’ll take Caroline to the red option, Natasha, coach these guys through the white and the blue. Yes, that’s the spirit Natasha, team, team, team.

NATASHA	Come on.

CALEB	Natasha, you want to talk about this one?

NATASHA	Not really. Jump over it, blah, blah, next.

BIANCA	So, this is the white flag Nicole, this is the one you’ll be jumping.

NATASHA	Excuse me, we were walking here.

STELLA	Yeah, it’s not like you own the course.

CALEB	Except, technically they do, because it’s their course.

STELLA	Whatever.

NATASHA	And since when are you riding intro? I thought you rode pre-training?

BIANCA	Check the rule book, Natasha. Nicole has a new horse, he hasn’t been upgraded yet.

NICOLE	That’s what we told the judges, anyway.

NATASHA	You dropped a grade to win? You guys are such cheats.

NICOLE	But we’re also winners.

CALEB	Yeah, because you cheat. So, it’s an empty, hollow, victory.

BIANCA	Funny, our trophy cabinet isn’t empty.

NICOLE	There’s nothing on the bottom shelf.

BIANCA	Everyone wants to ride for Dulmoth Park, so it’s so sad that you have to scrabble around for total drop kick beginners, just to make up a team.

NATASHA	We’re not horrible and elitist, like you guys.

CALEB	We like including people.

NATASHA	Exactly, I mean, Issie might be a terrible rider, but she’s our terrible rider.

ISSIE	Thank you, Natasha.

NATASHA	You know what I mean. Cheat all you like Bianca, we’ll still thrash you.

BIANCA	Seriously. Even if you were on like, flying unicorns, you still wouldn’t beat us.

NICOLE	Apparently unicorns aren’t real. I looked it up.

BIANCA	Yes, I know, that is why I said it.

ANNOUNCER	And pre-training is under way, the first riders have taken to the course. Next to ride is Caleb Burford on Galileo.

JUMP STEWARD	go.

STELLA	Go Caleb.

MITCH	Come on Natasha.

JUMP STEWARD	And go.

ISSIE	Go Natasha.

AMANDA	Gosh, I mean those jumps, they look very high.

ISSIE	Yeah, I told you, I’m not doing those ones.

AMANDA	Yeah, well just remember, you just…

ISSIE	A beginner, yes, thank you mum.

STELLA	Come on, let’s go watch.

ISSIE	Ok.

STELLA	Caroline, Caroline, come on.

KENNY	Is the big man not here?

AMANDA	Hmm?

KENNY	Sam.

AMANDA	Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, he’s working.

KENNY	Yeah, ‘course, he’s a hustler that one. You must be proud?

ANNOUNCER	Twenty-three, Natasha Tucker and Aramis are jumping beautifully. Making light work of the course there.

STELLA	Go Caleb.

ANNOUNCER	A clear round for Caleb Burford, but there will be time penalties. And next time is twenty-three, Natasha Tucker, with a very successful round. Well within the time there.

CALEB	Time penalties.

NATASHA	It’s ok.

ISSIE	You guys tack up.

STELLA	What?

ISSIE	Are you ok?

STELLA	Oh yeah, just a bit of a headache.

NATASHA	Probably just nerves, they’ll go when you start warming up.

ISSIE	Am I meant to be there too? Which one’s the warmup arena.

NATASHA	The one that’s not the actual arena.

ISSIE	Oh, I’m such a beginner.

CALEB	Everyone starts somewhere.

ISSIE	Is there actually any hope? Me, novice, Caroline, injured shoulder.

STELLA	Yeah, Caroline will be fine, she’s brave.

CALEB	And maybe the adrenaline will mean she doesn’t feel it.

ISSIE	Hmm, here’s hoping.

ISSIE	Woah, woah, woah Blaze, easy, easy girl, easy, easy. Who is that? You’re alright.

AMANDA	Will Issie? She’s not gonna do those jumps.

MITCH	Yeah, yeah…

HAMISH	Come on Stel.

STELLA’S MUM	Oh. Is she alright?

NATASHA	Yeah, it’s not for points, it’s just a warmup round.

STELLA’S MUM	Ok, ok.

HAMISH	Come on, this time.

NATASHA	Straight line.

STELLA’S MUM	You got it girl.

BIANCA	Good to see Kauri Point bringing the magic.

NICOLE	That wasn’t magic, it was…

BIANCA	I was being sarcastic.

NATASHA	Are you ok?

STELLA	There’s just this noise in my head, like bees and it keeps coming and going all day.

CALEB	It’s the PA, it’s interfering with her cochlear implant.

CAROLINE	So we get them to turn off the PA.

CALEB	Or, she turns off the implant.

CAROLINE	That could work too.

CAROLINE	Anything?

STELLA	Nothing.

BIANCA	Good luck out there today Caro. Break a leg.

NATASHA	Hey, hey, hey are you ok?

ISSIE	I’m not ready for this. Am I?

TOM	Just take it easy out there, don’t push it. She’s a quick mare, she’ll make up the time. Just take the black flag options, play it safe.

ISSIE	Sure, I mean, I’m just making up for numbers, right? It’s not like I’m a real rider.

TOM	You’re our anchor out there today Issie, and you’ll do what the team requires and what we need from you is to complete the course safely.

ISSIE	I feel sick.

TOM	Trust me, once you’re out there, you take that first jump, all your nerves disappear and it’s just you, and the horse.

ISSIE	You hear that girl? It’s just you and me.

ISSIE	Woah, woah, easy Blaze, easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy. Shh, easy, easy. What’s wrong with you.

TOM	Come on, Get your number on, time to go.

CALEB	Ok, careful Caroline, let’s get you in the float to sit down.

NATASHA	I’m sure you’ll be fine.

ISSIE	Caroline?

CALEB	There’s no way she can ride.

NATASHA	And Dulmoth Park beats us? There must be something we can do.

CAROLINE	Like what, it’s not like anyone else can ride for me. Although…

CALEB	Yeah, you wanted to ride training today right?

NATASHA	Yeah, but.

ISSIE	This could work. Tie your hair up, swap numbers. No one will notice.

NATASHA	A. I’ve never ridden Treacle before and B, this plan is crazy.

CAROLINE	I suppose Issie could always win it for us.

ISSIE and NATASHA	Yeah right.

CALEB	Do it Natasha, for the team.

JUMP STEWARD	go.

ANNOUNCER	Dulmoth Park rider  off to a good start… indeed a positive start for number . Rider , excellent… and that’s a decent finish for number , in what’s proven to be exceptionally... Bianca making excellent time… and that’s a clear round for number , Bianca… next up, riding in the training category, we have Caroline Burford from Kauri Point.

JUMP STEWARD	You ready sixty-five? go.

ANNOUNCER	That’s a clear round for sixty-five, Caroline Burford, riding from Kauri Point.

JUMP STEWARD	Ready Stella? go.

SPECTATOR	Let’s go Stella.

CAROLINE	Yes. You just got a clear round.

NATASHA	You, just got a clear round.

CAROLINE	In your face Dulmoth Park.

NATASHA	Come on, quickly, here’s your bow. Yeah, there we go.

TOM	Need a hand?

CAROLINE	And then Bianca went by and she was like, ‘break a leg’ or something and then she went bam.

NATASHA	Yeah, obviously deliberately, you know, she must have known.

CAROLINE	That I had an injured shoulder.

TOM	Wait, when did you injure your shoulder?

CAROLINE	In the forest, but, Dan was great…

TOM	Wait, what were you doing in the forest?

CAROLINE	I’m gonna stop talking now.

STELLA	I went all clear. Oh, what?

ANNOUNCER	Announcement, Kauri Point rider Caroline Burford has been disqualified from the competition. Number sixty-five disqualified from competition.

STELLA	What’s happening?

CAROLINE	Natasha rode for me. I’m disqualified.

ISSIE	What? They knew you swapped?

NATASHA	No, they didn’t. Tom, on the other hand…

CAROLINE	Tom knows we switched.

STELLA	Ooh.

ISSIE	He told the officials?

NATASHA	He’s so honest.

CALEB	So, we lose Caz’s score.

CAROLINE	At least Dulmoth Park got penalties.

NATASHA	Yeah, but not enough.

STELLA	If you make a really good time, then, we can beat Dulmoth Park.

ISSIE	What?

CALEB	Woah guys, too much pressure.

NATASHA	Issie can’t ride fast enough.

ISSIE	What she said.

CAROLINE	Well, she might?

ISSIE	She won’t.

NATASHA	What she said.

ANNOUNCER	Calling Issie Brown and Blaze to the start box, please.

CALEB	Just, go out there and have fun.

ISSIE	Blaze, do you ever have those moments where you just wish you were somewhere else?

JUMP STEWARD	Ready eighty-one?

TOM	Play it safe, Issie.

ISSIE	Ready.

JUMP STEWARD	go.

KENNY	Go Issie.

TOM	Here she comes.

AMANDA	She’s going very fast.

MITCH	Looking strong Amanda. Stop fussing.

ANNOUNCER	Issie Brown and Blaze off to a confident start, and heading down towards the water jump now.

NATASHA	Oh no.

ISSIE	Let’s do this Blaze.

CALEB	Why’s she heading to the…

CAROLINE	She’s gonna jump out.

NATASHA	No, Issie.

TOM	Issie, Issie you ok? You alright?

ISSIE	Tom, I can’t stand the silent treatment. You haven’t said one word to me since we left the showgrounds.

TOM	And I’m normally known for my conversation?

ISSIE	Look. I know I messed up. And the thing is, I knew Blaze was upset, something had her spooked just before the start, but…

TOM	What?

ISSIE	I saw someone, run off, and they looked like the, the horse rustler.

TOM	Really? You sure?

ISSIE	No, oh, I don’t know. I’m sorry, about today.

TOM	Why’d you push your luck? Why’d you take that log? All you had to do was come home safe.

ISSIE	Because, if I took the fast option, then we would have won, and those horrific Dulmoth Park girls were like, ‘oh, we’re gonna win, blah, blah, blah.’

TOM	Issie, you need to spend less time listening to idiots and more time listening to your horse.

TOM	I got a text, with your results. Do you want to know?

DAN	I don’t know, do I?

NATASHA	What did Tom say?

DAN	He told me about my results.

NATASHA	Oh, how’d it go?

ISSIE	Well?

DAN	I passed.

NATASHA	Amazing, I knew you would.

DAN	So, you guys didn’t seem so lucky.

ISSIE	Ugh.

NATASHA	Yeah, watching Bianca win was, just…

CAROLINE	We’ll get them next year though.

CALEB	And take it all the way to the champs.

STELLA	Yeah.

ISSIE	Oh, Caroline, what did the guys at A and E say?

CAROLINE	That it was a sprain and it should have been in a sling.

DAN	Oh. Who knew?

CAROLINE	Yeah, I know, I should have listened to you, yadda, yadda.

DAN	It looks like I can treat horses and humans. So, if any of you got any injuries?

ISSIE	Me.

STELLA	Didn’t the medic say you were ok?

ISSIE	Yeah, but I’ve got a massive bruise. I fell on a protection crystal my Gran gave me.

CAROLINE	It was epic the way you took that water jump though.

NATASHA	Stupid. But yeah, also epic.

DAN	Hold up, hold up. You took the water jump?

CALEB	Guys. Come look at this.

ISSIE	Oh, you salvaged the drone footage.

CAROLINE	Hey look, it’s us.

NATASHA	What?

CALEB	They’ve seen the drone.

CAROLINE	OMG.

DAN	They were covering something up.

ISSIE	Guys, what is going on?
