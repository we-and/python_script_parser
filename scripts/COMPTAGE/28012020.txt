NAI NAI (O.S.)			Hello? 

BILLI (V.0.)			Nai Nai, hi!

NAI NAI			Billi! It's the middle of the night, why aren't you sleeping?

BILLI (V.O.)			Sleeping? I'm only 12 hours ahead!

BILLI				Isn't it 7AM in China?

NAI NAI (V.O.)	It's almost 7:30! Is it cold there? Are you wearing enough? Are you wearing a hat?

BILLI				I'm wearing one. Don't worry about me, Nai Nai!	

NAI NAI (V.O.)			You have to be careful. 

NAI NAI	I read that in New York, people will steal your earrings. They'll rip them out! And then you have to go to the hospital for surgery.	
			
BILLI				I'm not wearing earrings.

NAI NAI (V.O.)			Ah. So you heard too.

BILLI				What's that sound? Where are you?

NAI NAI			I'm at your great aunt's house.

NAI NAI			What are you doing?

BILLI (V.O.)			I'm going to Mom and Dad's-

SUZ				Do you have a second to save marine life? 

BILLI 				Hold on a second, Nai Nai.

SUZ				Alright.

BILLI				I was gonna say something snarky, but... I used to work this job.

SUZ				Ooh, what happened girl? You got fired?

BILLI				I quit! Because I was about to get fired.

NAI NAI (V.O.)			Who was that, Billi?

BILLI				Uh, no one, just a friend.

BILLI				What's that?

NAI NAI			It's nothing. I'll call you back later, OK?

BILLI				Yeah, call me back, Nai Nai-

NAI NAI			Where's my sister?

RADIOLOGIST			She's with the doctor.

LITTLE NAI NAI 		OK, Sis. Let's go.

NAI NAI			Did you talk to the doctor?

LITTLE NAI NAI 		Yep. You're in full health.

NAI NAI	Really? What about the CT scan? What about the spots they saw before?	

LITTLE NAI NAI 	It's all clear. Turned out to be nothing. They're just benign shadows.

NAI NAI			Benign shadows? What's that mean?

LITTLE NAI NAI 		That's just what the doctor said. You're fine. Let's go, Sis.

HAIYAN (V.O.)	So one day the wife goes out of town. And when she returns, the husband says... honey, the cat is dead. And says says how can you tell me so abruptly like this? You have to ease me into bad news.

HAIYAN 	Like honey... the cat, he got on the roof. So... now... a few months later the wife goes out of town again. And she returns and the husband greets her again. But this time he learned his lesson. And as the wife comes through the door he says, honey, your mom, she got on the roof.

BILLI				How did you get in here?

BILLI				Nai Nai.

NAI NAI			Billi!

NAI NAI (V.O.)			I'm sorry I hung up earlier.

BILLI				It's OK. What happened?	

NAI NAI (V.O.)			Nothing. I'm good.

NAI NAI			You're spilling. You're spilling!

NAI NAI			This old man. He's so careless!

BILLI				You mean Mr. Li?

NAI NAI (V.O.)			I never should have agreed to be with him!

BILLI				Nai Nai...

NAI NAI			He can't hear me anyway. He's practically deaf.

BILLI (V.O.)			Why are you still with him?

NAI NAI	It's been so many years. It's better than living alone. At least there's a live body in the house. Otherwise, when you get up to go to the bathroom... all you see are your own shadows. Child... do you have a friend yet?

BILLI (V.O.)			I have a lot of friends, Nai Nai.

NAI NAI			I mean a special friend. You're all alone.

NAI NAI (V.O.)			I worry about you. New York is such a big place. 


NAI NAI (V.O.)			Billi? Are you OK?

BILLI				I'm fine... I'm just tired.

NAI NAI (V.O.)			If you're tired, go to bed!

BILLI				OK. I love you, Nai Nai.

NAI NAI (V.O.)			I love you. I love you.

SHIRLEY			For what month?

BILLI				For this month, May?

SHIRLEY	And what happened to April? My mom says you didn't pay April yet. You know if you moved out right now, we could literally double the rent?

JIAN	So what, you're broke again? Are you always going to live like this?

BILLI				Poor but sexy, I hope so.
	
JIAN	Why you not try to save, huh? You should change your expensive lifestyle.
	
BILLI	Mom, if you're going to give me shit every time I come home, I'm not coming home anymore.

JIAN				Lower your voice. Dad's sleeping.

BILLI (O.S.)			Sleeping? It's 6PM. What's wrong with him?

JIAN				Nothing. He's just tired.

BILLI				Is he okay?

JIAN				He's fine, we're just busy that's all.

BILLI				Busy with what? What's going on?

JIAN				Hao Hao's getting married, so we have to go to China.

BILLI				What? Since when? Hasn't he like just started dating that girl?
	
JIAN				You don't need to go. No one's expecting you to go.

BILLI				I mean, he's my only cousin. Don't you think I should be there? 

BILLI				Okay, okay. Do you think he knocked her up?

JIAN				How many wontons you want?

BILLI				Five.

JIAN				Five? That's not enough.

BILLI				Make a dozen then.

JIAN				Ten's good.

BILLI				Okay.

BILLI				What's wrong Dad?

HAIYAN			Nothing.

BILLI	You and mom got in a fight? You've been drinking? Please tell me what's going on. You're scaring me. Something's going on. Just tell me what's going on.

JIAN 				Your Nai Nai's dying. 

JIAN (O.S.)	She has stage four lung cancer. The doctor says she has three months.

JIAN 				Could be faster, you never know.

BILLI				I need to call her.

HAIYAN			You can't do that.

BILLI				I need to go see her.

HAIYAN			Can't do that.

HAIYAN (CONT'D)	She doesn't know. The family thinks it's better not to tell her. So you can't say anything.

BILLI	I don't understand. She doesn't have a lot of time left, she should know, right?


HAIYAN	There's nothing they can do. So everyone decided it's better not to tell her.


BILLI				Why is that better?

JIAN	Chinese people have saying, when people get cancer they die. It's not cancer that killed them, it's the fear.

BILLI	Okay, when were you guys gonna tell me this? How could you let me find out like this?

JIAN				How should I have told you? Oh, your grandma's on the roof?


BILLI				What about the wedding?

HAIYAN	The wedding is an excuse so everyone can go see her. We leave first thing in the morning.

BILLI				I need to go. I need to go.

JIAN	Everyone thinks it's better if you don't. Look at you. You can't hide your emotions. If you go now, Nai Nai will find out right away.

GROUP	Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Tony Happy birthday to you

MR. LI (O.S.)			Who's that?

BILLI (O.S.)			It's me, Billi.

MR. LI 				Who?

BILLI (O.S.)			Mr. Li?

BILLI (O.S.)			Billi.

MR. LI (O.S.)			Billi?

MR. LI 				Child, how come you're here? Quick, come in!

MR. LI				Pass that to me.

NAI NAI	Billi came back... Billi, you stupid child! Come, let me look at you. Oh you're not that skinny! Your mother said you got skinny but you're not that skinny! Oh, my granddaughter. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I've been calling you all week. But you didn't answer! Your mother said you were too busy to come. What's wrong? Why aren't you talking?

BILLI				I've missed you.

NAI NAI 			I know. How'd you get here? Did you fly?		

BILLI				I swam.

NAI NAI	Stupid child, teasing me! This little round butt hasn't changed at all! I've always loved to touch your little round butt!


BILLI				Little Nai Nai.

LITTLE NAI NAI	I'm making meat pies. You must be starving. I remember these were your favorite as a kid.

LITTLE NAI NAI			This is Mrs. Gao.

BILLI					Hello.

MRS. GAO				You're the granddaughter!

MRS. GAO				You're back home too.

BILLI					Yes.

MRS. GAO				Great.

LITTLE NAI NAI			Last time you were here, we still had Mrs. Jin.	

BILLI					I remember Mrs. Ma?

LITTLE NAI NAI	Mrs. Ma? That was four maids ago! Has it been that long since you've been back?

JIAN					Stop fooling around, oil is hot.

BILLI					Don't be mad, Mom.

JIAN	Where'd you get the money to buy a ticket? Credit card, right?

BILLI	Mom, I'm fine. Look at my face, look at my face, look at my face, look.

JIAN					Take to table.

NAI NAI				It's been too long since we've all been together like this.

AUNTIE LING				Has it been over 20 years?

LITTLE NAI NAI	At least! Haiyan went to America 25 years ago. Billi was only six! And Haibin left for Japan right after.

UNCLE HAIBIN				That's a long time.

HAIYAN				Time flies.

MRS. GAO 	These just came off the stove. Eat them while they're hot.		


NAI NAI	Look at these wonderful grandchildren of mine! Billi is very strong. Independent. Not someone who just follows everyone else. Hao Hao's always been sensitive. Now he's all grown up. And getting married! I've been looking forward to this day for a long time.

AUNTIE LING				Too bad neither speak Chinese well.
	
UNCLE HAIBIN				Hao Hao's Chinese is good, he's just being shy.

UNCLE HAIBIN				Hao Hao, talk to your grandma in Chinese.

HAO HAO	We don't need a big wedding banquet. We came to spend time with you.	

NAI NAI	Nonsense! You came home to get married. We must have a proper banquet!

AUNTIE LING	Ma, let's just keep it simple. We don't need to go overboard.

NAI NAI	Stop it! Everything's already booked. I sent invitations out last week. My only grandson's getting married, we can't look cheap!

NAI NAI				Hao Hao, eat! Aiko. Have a meat pie.

NAI NAI				Why aren't you eating?

BILLI					I'm not hungry.

NAI NAI	How can you not be hungry? You've been on the road all day.	

NAI NAI				Take a big bite! It's good, right?

NAI NAI				What's wrong? Not feeling well?

BILLI					I'm fine.

UNCLE HAIBIN				It must be jet lag. I'll take you to the hotel first.

BILLI					Hotel? Why can't I stay here?


UNCLE HAIBIN	With so many people visiting, it's easier if we all stay at a hotel. I'll walk you there.

NAI NAI	Don't worry. The hotel is very nice.  It's newly built! Go get some rest. There's lots to do before the wedding.

FIN REEL 1

UNCLE HAIBIN	I spoke to a cancer specialist in Japan. I bought her some medicine.

BILLI					From the Japanese doctor?

UNCLE HAIBIN				From the Internet.

UNCLE HAIBIN				Nai Nai... Nai Nai loves you very much, you know that?

BILLI					I know.

UNCLE HAIBIN				Nai Nai is very sick.

BILLI					I know.

UNCLE HAIBIN				She doesn't know anything about her illness.

BILLI					I know.

UNCLE HAIBIN				You have to be very careful not to tell her.

BILLI					I know! Dad told me!

UNCLE HAIBIN	You will feel sad. But... no matter how sad you feel... you cannot tell her.

BILLI					I know.

UNCLE HAIBIN				She doesn't have long left.

BILLI					I know.

UNCLE HAIBIN				We're not planning to tell her.

BILLI 					I know.

UNCLE HAIBIN				No matter what, you cannot tell her.


UNCLE HAIBIN	What do you mean the elevator's broken? Isn't this a newly opened hotel?

MICHAEL	I'm so sorry, sir. It's under maintenance. This way please, sir. I'll carry the luggage. I'm sorry.

UNCLE HAIBIN				You OK by yourself?

BILLI					Yes.

UNCLE HAIBIN				I'll head back.

BILLI					OK.

UNCLE HAIBIN				Rest well.

BILLI					I will.

BUSINESSMAN 1			We want the same room as last time.

MICHAEL				No problem.

BILLI					Are we almost there?

MICHAEL				Almost! Are you visiting from abroad?

BILLI					Yes.

MICHAEL				Which country?

BILLI					America.

MICHAEL	America? You don't look like an American. What'd you come back for?
	
BILLI					A wedding.

MICHAEL				Who's getting married?

BILLI					My cousin... my "tang di".

MICHAEL				Oh your cousin. He's also from America?

BILLI					No, Japan.

MICHAEL				Japan? What are they doing in Japan?

BILLI					I don't know. My uncle paints.

BILLI					Thank you.

MICHAEL				And what does your father do in America?

BILLI					He's a translator. Do you have water? For drinking?

MICHAEL				Yes! You can use this boiler.

BILLI					OK got it.

BILLI					That's fine, thank you.

MICHAEL				So what do you think's better?  China or America?

BILLI					It's different.

MICHAEL	What do you mean different? It must be much nicer in America.

BILLI					It's just... different.

MICHAEL				But I guess you're more used to America, right?

BILLI					I guess.

MICHAEL				OK, if you need anything, just tell me.

BILLI					'K, thanks. Bye.

BILLI					Thank you.

NAI NAI				Come do it with me!

NAI NAI	Be serious! Try harder. This will clear out all the bad toxins. Then you inhale to take in fresh oxygen. Understand?

BILLI					Yes.

NAI NAI				Let's do it together.

NAI NAI				Inhale.

NAI NAI				Make it stronger!

NAI NAI				Open your eyes! Lift your chest!

BILLI					OK got it.

NAI NAI				Do you get it?

BILLI					I get it!

NAI NAI				You can also slap your arms. Slap your back.

BILLI					Slap my butt?

NAI NAI				Stupid child! Slap your legs, get the circulation going.

NAI NAI				Understand?

BILLI					Understand.

NAI NAI	Now you can practice this on your own  when you return to America!

NAI NAI				It's good for you! Trust me! Try again! Inhale...

NAI NAI	It's OK. I got it. I go up and down by myself every morning.

BILLI					Doesn't that hurt your legs?

NAI NAI	Even so, I have to keep exercising. It's the reason I'm so healthy. Even at my age!

GU GU					I heard you came back!

BILLI					Hi Auntie!

GU GU					You remember Bao? Bao, say hi!

BILLI					Little Bao, you've gotten so big!

LITTLE BAO				I'm not little Bao! I'm just called Bao!

BILLI					Oh, Bao's here!

NAI NAI				YuPing, come sit come sit!

NAI NAI	Jian. Something's off about Haiyan.  Have you noticed? His face is all puffy and discolored. He seems very unhappy.

JIAN					He's fine, Ma.

NAI NAI	He looks so tired. Is he still drinking? You can't let him drink. Alcohol can ruin a person. I know so many men around here who drank themselves to death.

JIAN					He barely drinks anymore.

NAI NAI				Is everything OK at home?

JIAN 					Everything's fine. Really, Ma.

NAI NAI 				I know you guys have had issues in the past...

JIAN					At our age, what issues could we still have?

NAI NAI	They're just vitamins. Your uncle bought it for me from Japan. He says they're expensive. So they must be good. The Japanese really know how to take care of themselves!

JIAN					Mr. Li, you finished?

NAI NAI	Don't mind him, that's just how he is. He eats and leaves. Doesn't care about anything that doesn't concern him.

NAI NAI	Listen to me... I know everyone's excited to see me. But let's not forget why we're here. The wedding is the big event! If anyone asks nobody say Hao Hao and his bride have only been dating 3 months.

AUNTIE LING				Ma, I already told you, Aiko's not pregnant.

NAI NAI	It's about appearances. You know how people think! I don't want people talking behind our backs. If anyone asks just say they've been dating 6 months.

JIAN					Why 6 months? Might as well say a year then.

NAI NAI				Great idea. A year's better. We'll say a year!


NAI NAI	Listen… the wedding's in 3 days. Someone needs to come see the banquet hall with me.

BILLI					I'll come!

NAI NAI				No you can’t be much help anyway!

HAIYAN				Ma, I'll go.

NAI NAI				No, you rest. Look at your face. It's not right.

HAIBIN	Ma, why don't you rest? I'll go check on the banquet hall.

NAI NAI				I have to go myself. You don't even know who to talk to.

BILLI					What can I do?

NAI NAI	You don't need to do anything. You don't look good either. Must still be the jet lag.

GU GU					I'll take them to the massage parlor.

NAI NAI				Oh great!

NAI NAI	You guys go relax. You better not get sick before the wedding!

NAI NAI				Eat eat eat!

NAI NAI	When I booked the wedding you guys told me it'd be lobster. Now you act like you don't know anything about it?

BANQUET HALL MANAGER	I don't know anything about that. The menu says crab, not lobster.

NAI NAI				I know it says crab, but I ordered lobster!

BANQUET HALL MANAGER		Fine. Let me ask.

BANQUET HALL MANAGER		Little Ping! Little Ping! Go get the chef! Hurry up!

BANQUET HALL MANAGER	Let’s take a look at the  alcohol options. We have baijiu, red wine, white wine, beer -


NAI NAI				We're bringing champagne.

HAIBIN					Champagne?

NAI NAI				Your brother bought it.

NAI NAI (CONT'D)			Looks very nice and expensive!

HAIBIN					Chinese people won't drink that stuff. Order baijiu!

BANQUET HALL MANAGER	Mrs. Zhao says she was told the meal would have lobster, not crab.

CHEF					It's not lobster, it’s crab.

NAI NAI	What kind of scam is this? When I booked, you guys told me it'd be lobster! We already paid a deposit! Now it's 3 days before the wedding and you change the menu without telling us!

CHEF	I don't know anything about that. I was told to make crab.

HAIBIN					Ma, don't get all worked up over this!

NAI NAI				I'm fine. I just need to rest a bit.

HAIYAN				So what's going on with the fellowship?

BILLI					Nothing.

HAIYAN				You still haven't heard anything?

BILLI					No.

HAIYAN				Well, when are they gonna let you know?

BILLI					I don't know, Dad.

HAIYAN				How are you doing with money?

BILLI					I'm fine.

HAIYAN				Can you afford this trip?

BILLI					Yes, I'm fine.

HAIYAN				You need help?

BILLI					No, I'm fine.

GU GU					All set. Let's go.

MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST	This way please.

MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST	"Mei  nu", what treatment would you like?

GU GU					Her Chinese isn’t great. Give her the full body massage!

MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST	Cupping too?

GU GU					The whole package.

MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST	Same for you, "mei nu"?

GU GU					I don't need cupping today.

BILLI					What is "mei nu"?

HAIYAN				It means beauty.

GU GU	Always "mei nu, mei nu." Everyone in China’s called “mei nu.” Old or young. Beautiful or ugly. All beauties! So stupid!

MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST	Sir, what about you?

HAIYAN				You can call me beauty.

MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST	I mean what kind of treatment would you like?

MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST	I recommend our bath and massage treatment. The tub is filled with herbs.

HAIYAN				What do you think?

GU GU	Why are you asking me? Ask yourself if you want to take a bath!

HAIYAN				Can you show me the tub?

MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST	No problem, this way please.

REEL 3

BILLI					Ow! Auntie, I thought this was a massage!

GU GU (O.S.)				Suck it up.

BILLI'S MASSEUSE (O.S.)		A little pain is normal, otherwise it doesn't work.

BILLI					Auntie. Don't you think we should tell Nai Nai?

GU GU					Tell her? What for?

GU GU					Ow that hurts! What's going on?

GU GU'S MASSEUSE	This is the sleeping point. You haven't been sleeping well. Have you been stressed lately? Try to relax.

BILLI					What if she has things to take care of?

GU GU					She doesn't have anything like that.

BILLI					What if... she wants to say goodbye?

GU GU	Say goodbye? That's too painful. Why would you want her to go through that? She seems totally normal right now. If you tell her, you'll ruin her good mood, right?	
PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)		"Mei nu", get closer to him.

NAI NAI	Get closer! He told you to get closer! Come, lay your head on his shoulder. Hao Hao, wrap your arms around her. Your arm... hold him. Now smile.

NAI NAI	What's wrong with this girl? Can't they act like a normal couple in love? That girl is unaffectionate. Nothing like our family. I have to yell at her just to hug him! Makes me wonder what they do in the bedroom when I'm not here.	

BILLI					Nai Nai, she seems really nice.

NAI NAI	She's dumb. I don't like her! She doesn't understand anything!

BILLI	She doesn't understand because she doesn't speak Chinese!

NAI NAI				No, she's dumb. She's dumb!


NAI NAI				Look at you.

NAI NAI	Smart. Beautiful. You must find someone to take care of you.

BILLI					I take care of myself, Nai Nai.

NAI NAI	You're still young, child. As you get older, it's good to have someone to take care of you.

BILLI					Does Mr. Li take care of you?

NAI NAI	It's also good to be independent. A woman should be self-sufficient. Stupid child. Too lovable!

NAI NAI	I'll never forget... when your parents brought you to my house, you were barely two years old. You were skinny as a twig... because of that horrible nanny who stole your eggs! And she'd take you all over the city and only feed you popsicles

NAI NAI (CONT'D)			Do you remember this? 

BILLI					No. Why did she steal my eggs?

NAI NAI	Eggs were rationed back then. Your parents saved theirs to give to you.

NAI NAI	These last few days, there's been too much going on. We haven't been able to talk much.

WEDDING HANDLER			Oh, sorry. We're lost. Sorry.

NAI NAI	You know... the wedding is very important. A lot of friends and family are coming. They haven't seen you since you were little! I know you have a lot on your mind, but you can't be weird at the wedding. You must be generous in spirit. And be courteous! When you see people, you should loudly say, "Hello uncle! Hello auntie!" Don't be "nio nio ne ne."

BILLI					What's "nio nio ne ne"?

NAI NAI				You don't understand?

BILLI					No.

NAI NAI				Watch me.

NAI NAI	Understand? If someone asks you to sing, don't say I can't sing, I won't sing. That'll make the whole room go cold. Promise me you won't act like that.	 When you get married I'll throw you an even bigger wedding banquet.

YUPING	It's so rare for us to be together. Just look at your mother's face.

NAI NAI				I'm happy.

YUPING (O.S.)				Come, let's toast.	

NICO	Billi, you ever think about moving back to China? A lot of foreigners are moving here to get rich.	

YUPING	In America, how long would it take to make a million dollars?	

BILLI					A long time.

YUPING				Really?

YUPING (CONT'D)			It's very easy in China.

NICO					That's true.

BILLI					Life is not all about money. Money can't buy everything.

YUPING	But money doesn't get in the way. You can still enjoy the stuff money can't buy.	

JIAN	If it's so easy to get rich here, why are you sending Bao to America for college?

YUPING				For more opportunity.

JIAN 	What kind of opportunity? Maybe after going to America, Bao won't care about money.

YUPING	You guys don't have to worry, Billi will make big money when she becomes a famous writer! You're investing in her talent.

JIAN					So raising a kid is like playing the stock market?

BILLI					What's that mean?

HAIYAN	They say you're a stock investment and you're gonna make us a lot of money.

JIAN	Well we can't expect that from you, right? You are the losing stock.

JIAN	You know... when we first moved to America, a friend took us to a church. As we were leaving the service Billi suddenly stopped in front of a piano. She reached her hand out to play,  and Haiyan stopped her. The pastor came over and Haiyan quickly explained that Billi used to play the piano in China. After we moved, we couldn't afford it so Billi stopped playing. The pastor walked away without saying a word. When she came back, she handed us a key and said this is the key to the church. Bring Billi to play the piano anytime you want.	

NAI NAI				Really? They really just gave you the key?

JIAN					That's America.

BILLI	Mom, that church is not representative of all America. We have a lot of problems. Guns. Health care.

JIAN					If you think China that good, why don't you move here?

NICO					China has its benefits! We're not totally useless.

JIAN					Of course. The roast duck is still delicious!

NAI NAI	That's enough! No matter what, you can't criticize China. Don't forget you're still Chinese!

HAIYAN	Technically, we're American. I mean, we have American passports.
	
HAIBIN	I'll always be Chinese. No matter where I live or what passport I hold.

YUPING	You all may think the moon is rounder outside China but have you considered your mother? Growing old without her kids around.


NAI NAI	Alright, alright! Everyone's home, let's talk about happy things!

JIAN					But YuPing... you're still sending Bao to America for					college?	

YUPING				He'll be back. He won't stay there.

JIAN	You can't guarantee that. But even with the risk that he won't return you'll still send him away, right?

SUN AO				So how's your piano, Billi?

BILLI					I don't play anymore.

NAI NAI				Go home, I'm fine.

LITTLE NAI NAI			How can I leave when you're coughing like this?

NAI NAI	There's nothing to worry about! I just haven't gotten over the cold I had. Don't tell the children.

NAI NAI (CONT'D)			They'll be worried for nothing.

LITTLE NAI NAI			I won't say anything.

NAI NAI				Lock the door.

MRS. GAO				Sure.

NAI NAI				Go home, Sis.

UNCLE HAIBIN				OK Auntie. I'll meet you there.

BILLI					What's going on?

UNCLE HAIBIN				Nai Nai went to the hospital.

BILLI					What happened?

HAIYAN				I don't know.

HAIYAN				Billi, it's the wrong way.

BILLI					This way is fine.

HAIYAN				We have to go around.

BILLI	He says it's fine. Which way are we going? Dad, do you know where we're going?

HAIYAN				This way.

BILLI					My umbrella...

BILLI (CONT'D)				Is this the right way?

HAIYAN				Yes.

BILLI					Are you sure?

UNCLE HAIBIN				Ma?

NAI NAI				Why'd you all come? 

NAI NAI				You told them? I told you not to say anything!

LITTLE NAI NAI			You always blame me!

HAIYAN				You can't disappear without telling any of us.

NAI NAI (O.S.)				I'm fine!

LITTLE NAI NA				I'm going to find the doctor.

NAI NAI	What? Why are you all so serious? I just came to change my medicine. It's no big deal!

BILLI					Do you not feel well?

NAI NAI	I just have a bit of a cough. I didn't fully recover from the last time I had a cold. I just wanted to change my medicine. Maybe it'll work better.

HAIYAN				Doctor.	

DOCTOR SONG	Let's have a look. Inhale. Exhale. Cough. You have some infection.

NAI NAI	I'm already on antibiotics! You gave me bad medicine. Give me a better one, so I can heal faster. This is my grandson. He's getting married in two days!

DOCTOR SONG			Really? Congratulations.

NAI NAI				This is my granddaughter. She's back from America.

DOCTOR SONG	Visit from America? I went to school in the UK for many years.

BILLI					Oh, that's cool.

DOCTOR SONG			Where do you live?

BILLI					Uh, I'm in New York.

DOCTOR SONG	New York. I always wanted to visit New York. It's a very beautiful city.

BILLI	Yeah, it's very beautiful... Uh, question... do you know about my grandma's condition?

NAI NAI				What are you guys talking about?

BILLI					He studied in England so he speaks English.

NAI NAI				Really?	

DOCTOR SONG			It's true.	

NAI NAI				Dr. Song, let me ask you...	are you married?	

DOCTOR SONG			Not yet.

NAI NAI	The young man's so handsome, and a doctor and he speaks English! Not married? Impossible!

BILLI					How bad is she? But you can tell me the truth.

DOCTOR SONG			The cancer is quite advanced.

BILLI					Shouldn't we tell her?

DOCTOR SONG	In her situation, most families in China would choose not to tell her. When my grandmother had cancer, my family didn't tell her.

BILLI					Isn't it wrong to lie?

DOCTOR SONG			I mean if it's for good, it's not really a lie.

BILLI					I mean, it's still a lie.

DOCTOR SONG			It's a good lie.

BILLI					How's your grandmother?

DOCTOR SONG	She passed away, a few months after she was diagnosed.

DOCTOR SONG	Mrs. Zhao, you had pneumonia a few months ago. I suspect that your cough is left over from that. Let's do an X-ray to make sure the infection isn't spreading.

NAI NAI				That's not necessary. I just want to change my medicine.

DOCTOR SONG	We can change your medicine. But I still recommend an X-ray.

HAIYAN	Maybe we should tell her now. We can start making plans. When the time comes who will take care of her?

UNCLE HAIBIN				We don't need to tell her to make plans.

HAIYAN	You know, in America, we couldn't do this. We wouldn't be allowed to.

BILLI					It'd be... illegal.

BILLI (CONT'D)				How do you say illegal?

HAIYAN 				Illegal. In America, this is illegal.	

UNCLE HAIBIN				This isn't America -

LITTLE NAI NAI			It's not time to tell her yet!

BILLI					How do you know?

LITTLE NAI NAI			I just know.

BILLI	If Nai Nai knew we were all lying to her, wouldn't she be mad?	

LITTLE NAI NAI	What does she have to be mad about? She did the same thing herself!


BILLI					What do you mean?

LITTLE NAI NAI	When your grandpa had cancer, Nai Nai lied to him too. When she knew he was close to the end that's when she told him. When your Nai Nai reaches that point, I'll tell her too.	

LITTLE NAI NAI (O.S.)			Ellen!

LITTLE NAI NAI (O.S.)			Ellen, Little Ellen!

NAI NAI (O.S.)				Sing for us!

NAI NAI				Ellen, sing another!

NAI NAI				Mr. Li, go get the Maotai we saved!	

JIAN	Ma, there will be plenty of alcohol  at the wedding. Why don't you save your Maotai?

NAI NAI				What am I saving it for?

JIAN	You know your two sons! They don't know when to stop. Haiyan already has a fatty liver. The doctor told him not to drink! 

MR. LI					Where is it again?

NAI NAI				On the kitchen shelf.

NAI NAI 	These two rarely come back together. If they want to drink, let them drink!

NAI NAI				We're celebrating. Drink!

REEL 4

JIAN	Your mother's always telling me to take care of you but if she gets you drunk herself, she doesn't worry about your health.

BILLI					Mom, can we not do this right now, please?

JIAN					Every time you drink, you drink too much.

BILLI					Mom!

HAIYAN				Who's drunk? I'm not drunk.

BILLI					Can you- can we not right now?

HAIYAN				My ma gave it to me. I drink for my ma!

JIAN					Alright, alright.	

BILLI					Just leave him alone.

JIAN					Billi, the key.

BILLI					Nai Nai should not be organizing this wedding.

JIAN					If she enjoys it then just let her do it.

BILLI	She's sick. She should be resting or in a hospital. Not stressing about a fake wedding.

JIAN	You really don't know your Nai Nai. You know she enjoys bossing everyone around. Makes her feel important. Makes her feel in control.

BILLI					Mom.

JIAN					It's true!

JIAN	That's why she hated to stay in America in our house. You know? Because she could not tell anyone what to do. Whatever I do, never good enough for her. But she can't say anything because it was my house.

BILLI					Mom, stop!

JIAN					What? What did I say?

BILLI	You have always had issues with her, but right now, at this point...

JIAN					Oh, I don't have a problem with her.

JIAN (CONT'D)				She's the one that have a problem with me.

BILLI					She's dying.  Can't you be a little more sensitive?

JIAN					What you want from me?

JIAN (CONT'D)	To scream and cry like you? You know when my father died, I was also very sad. But I don't act like you.  When I went back to China for the funeral, everybody was watching me. They were all expecting me to fall apart. And they think if I don't cry, I don't love my father.

BILLI					No one's asking you to cry!

HAIYAN				Too loud!

JIAN	Like I'm in the zoo. But in here, if you don't cry, you don't put on a show they think you don't love your family. You know in here, they even hire  some professional criers. Just to show how sad they are. It's just so ridiculous. I hate that.

NAI NAI				Your grandpa loved bananas. Give him some bananas.

GU GU (O.S.)				You have to peel the oranges!

LITTLE NAI NAI			I don't think they need to be peeled.

NAI NAI				Yes, peel them! Otherwise he can't eat them.

BILLI					Should I drink it?

HAIYAN				Pour, just pour. Yeah, pour, very good.

NAI NAI				Billi, put these cookies out.

GU GU					You have to open them!

HAIYAN				They need to be opened too?

GU GU					Yes, open it!

AUNTIE LING				Rip the flowers too!

HAIYAN (O.S.)				Why do we have to rip the flowers?

GU GU	To prevent thieves. Some people steal offerings to put on their own family graves. This way they won't steal it!

NAI NAI				Don't give him cigarettes! He quit!

HAIYAN				He didn't quit.

NAI NAI				He did! A few weeks before he passed, he quit.

HAIYAN				Dad just told you he quit, but he never quit!

UNCLE HAIBIN	Ma, let the man smoke. He's already dead, what else can happen? Enjoy the cigarette, Dad.

NAI NAI (O.S.)	Burn the paper jacket for your grandfather. That way, he won't be cold in the winter.


NAI NAI	Old timer, we all came to see you. Our grandson's getting married tomorrow. We came to get your blessing. We ask you to bless Hao Hao and his new bride. Bless them with happiness. Bless their children with health and strength. One bow. Two bows. Three bows.


NAI NAI	Old timer, you left us too soon. Why did you have to leave so early? Wherever you are... we hope you're happy and peaceful. One bow. Two bows. Three bows.


NAI NAI	Bless both our sons with success in their businesses. One bow. Two bows. Three bows.




NAI NAI	Who else? Bless Billi. Bless her with a happy future. One bow. Two bows. Three bows.


LITTLE NAI NAI			Still bowing? We're all getting dizzy!


NAI NAI				Bless my little sister. Bless her -

LITTLE NAI NAI			Bless me to win big money in Mahjong!

NAI NAI	Bless your niece, YuPing. And Bao. Bless him to do well on his exams.


GU GU					Bao, keep up!

NAI NAI	When the time comes, just spread my ashes into the ocean. No one's ever home anyway.

GU GU					What are you talking about? I'm here!

NAI NAI	Just scatter me into the ocean. Then you won't have to travel back and forth all the time.

GU GU					Into the ocean? Nonsense!

NAI NAI				You don't agree?

GU GU					Certainly not.

GU GU (CONT'D)	We're Chinese. Humans must return to the earth we came from!

HAIYAN (O.S.)				This is NaiNai's old neighborhood.

HAIYAN (O.S.)	Do you remember that house? You used to love to play in the garden.

BILLI (O.S.)				Where is it?

JIAN (O.S.)				We already passed it.

BILLI 					Can we go back? I want to see it!

NAI NAI (O.S.)	There's nothing to see. That neighborhood is long gone. Even I don't recognize it anymore.

NAI NAI				OK, OK, that's enough.

MR. LI					Enough?

NAI NAI				Yes.

NAI NAI				Careful, don't burn yourself.

BILLI					Dad? Are you smoking? I thought you said you quit.

HAIYAN				I did. I will.

BILLI					Stop giving him cigarettes!

UNCLE HAIBIN	Don't control him. He's your father. You shouldn't try to control him.

HAIYAN				Go to bed, Billi.

HAIYAN				Forget it.

BILLI					What're you guys talking about?

HAIYAN				Nothing.

BILLI					Are you going to tell Nai Nai?

HAIYAN				I can't, Billi. I won't go against my family.

UNCLE HAIBIN	Billi. There are things you must understand... you guys moved to the West long ago. You think one's life belongs to oneself. But that's the difference between the East and the West. In the East, a person's life is part of a whole. Family. Society. You want to tell Nai Nai the truth... because you're afraid to take responsibility for her. Because it's too big of a burden. If you tell her...  then you don't have to feel guilty. We're not telling Nai Nai... because it's our duty to carry this emotional burden for her.

JIAN	Billi, don't just stand there. Come help find Aiko's earring.

BILLI					Where did she drop it?

HAO HAO				Not far.

AUNTIE LING				Hao Hao. Where's Aiko been?

JIAN	The earring is light, so it could have jumped farther away.

BILLI					Mom?

JIAN					Yeah?

BILLI					I want to stay in China and help take care of Nai Nai.
		
JIAN	What? You stay here, to do what? You can't cook, you can't clean.



JIAN					You don't even speak good Chinese. What can you do?

JIAN					Is this it, Hao Hao?

HAO HAO				Thank you!

BILLI					I'll figure it out, Mom.

JIAN	So you just stay here. And what? Wait for her to die? What about the fellowship? Just forget about it, huh? You're 30 years old, you can just stop your life and stay here? And every day she has to look at you, with that sad looking face? That's not nice for anybody, right?

BILLI	You know, one of the few good memories of my childhood, one of the summers at Nai Nai's. They had that garden. Ye Ye and I would catch dragonflies. And then we just moved to the States. Everything was different. Everyone was gone. And it was just the three of us.

JIAN					I know it was hard. It was hard for us too.

BILLI	I wanted to believe that it was a good thing, but all I saw was fear in your eyes. And I was confused and scared constantly because you never told me what was going on. And then Ye Ye died. You didn't even tell me he was sick. So it felt like he just... vanished suddenly. And you wouldn't even let me go to his funeral.

JIAN	You were at school. We didn't want you to miss school. We did what we thought was best for you.

BILLI	But I never saw him again. And every time I came back to China, he just wasn't there anymore. And I come back and he's just gone. The house is gone, A Die's gone, our Beijing home is gone and soon she'll be gone, too.

GROUP	Guests first! Strive for excellence! Make romance! Become history! Witness happiness! Move your whole life! We welcome your visit!

BILLI					Hello Auntie!


BILLI					Hello Auntie!

NAI NAI				Did you get the X-ray results?

LITTLE NAI NAI			No, I'll get them tomorrow.

NAI NAI	Tomorrow's Sunday! Now we'll have to wait until Monday!

LITTLE NAI NAI			I'll get them Monday! Stop worrying!

SUN AO (O.S.)	Welcome back to Changchun everyone! It doesn't matter if you're from America or Japan or anywhere else in the world.

SUN AO	What's important is that we're all one family. All citizens of the Earth. Of the solar system. Of the Milky Way. Just remember this! You'll always have a home in Changchun. We will always, always welcome you.

NICO	Yes. We will always, always welcome you! Everybody raise your glass, let's toast.

NICO	When you come home to Changchun you will eat well, drink well and be happy! That way, you'll remember to come back often!

NICO					Cheers!

SUN AO				Bottoms up!

UNCLE HAIBIN	Everyone keep eating, keep eating. Don't let me interrupt. As the oldest son, I'll say a few words on behalf of me and my brother. My brother and I... have not been home at the same time in over 25 years. Today, I'm very happy. We're welcoming Aiko to our family. Perhaps the next time we return we'll bring a little baby with us. Since my brother and I have been away we're grateful to you all for taking care of our mother. YuPing... all these years, you've been by my mother's side. Treating her like your own mother. I'm very grateful to you. Really, very grateful. But... the person I want to thank the most... the person I want to thank the most... is my mother. Ma... forgive me. All these years, I haven't been by your side. Everything... all of my accomplishments... are because of you. Ma... you're the best mother in the entire world!


UNCLE HAIBIN	Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm just too happy today. Happy thank you.

BILLI					Does everyone know?

HAIYAN				I think most people don't know. But I'm not sure.

NAI NAI				Eat more.

AUNTIE LING	She says "Thank you for attending our wedding ceremony."

AUNTIE LING	She says "I'm very happy to celebrate with you all." She says "Hao Hao is a very nice, good man."

GENERAL ZHU	The battlefield in front of us. Hoards of enemies! There were only a few of us left. And then, let me tell you... I used my martial arts skills. I killed five at once!

NAI NAI				This is my granddaughter!

GENERAL MU 				She's quite pretty!

GENERAL ZHU				Married yet?

BILLI					Not yet.

NAI NAI				Career first, then marriage!

NAI NAI	These three grandpas were in the army with me. They're all important government officials now!

GENERAL FU				Yeah, right! We're long retired!

GENERAL ZHU	Little Ting... I see you're still limping. Is it from that bullet you took in the war?

NAI NAI				You still remember that?

GENERAL ZHU	How could I forget? At the time, I had a plan. After the war... I was going to make you my wife! But then you got injured. And Comrade Wang carried you off.

GENERAL FU	That was a lifetime ago! You're confessing your love now?


GENERAL ZHU				If I don't say it now, I'll take it to my grave!

NAI NAI				You've had too much to drink!

GENERAL ZHU				It's good I'm telling you, right Little Ting?

NAI NAI				Little Ting? I'm OLD TING!

GENERAL MU	This time home you should talk more with your grandmother!

GENERAL FU				You've had too much to drink.

GENERAL ZHU				What are you talking about?

NAI NAI				Billi, go up and say a few words.

BILLI	Hi everyone. As you know, I was very young when I left China. My Chinese isn't very good. I'm sorry.

GUEST (O.S.)				It's great! Keep going!

BILLI	I almost didn't come back. I was busy with work. But... I still came back. In America we don't have a lot of family. I've missed all of you. I'm very happy to be back. I'm very happy to celebrate with you all.

BILLI					Thank you.

BILLI					I'm sorry. Sorry how do you say congratulations? Dad?

HAIYAN				Gong xi!

BILLI					Gong xi Hao Hao Aiko!

BILLI					Thank you.

BILLI SING	And so I came to see her And listen for a while And there he was this young boy Stranger to my eyes Strumming my pain with his fingers Singing my life with his words

HAIYAN SING	And so I came to see her And listen for a while And there he was this young boy Stranger to my eyes Strumming my pain with his fingers Singing my life with his words

JIAN	Auntie? It must be tough taking care of your sister all these years. In the future, you have to think more about yourself.

LITTLE NAI NAI	You don't have worry about me. I've already figured it all out. After she's gone... I'll go to Shenzhen to be with my husband. He's been out there working alone all these years. It hasn't been easy. I haven't been able to be by his side. When he retires soon, we'll be able to travel together.

JIAN					You can come visit us in America!
	
LITTLE NAI NAI			Right! Definitely! I've always wanted to see your house!

JIAN	If you come, we'll drive you around. We'll take you anywhere you want to go!

LITTLE NAI NAI	Great! That's fantastic! See, you don't have to worry about me. I'm totally fine!

UNCLE HAIBIN (O.S.)			Everyone stand up straight! Look into the lens!

NAI NAI	Why are you crying? Did you drink too much? You can't take a wedding photo with the groom crying. What are you crying about?
	
LITTLE NAI NAI			He's fine. They're tears of joy. Isn't that right Hao Hao?

LITTLE NAI NAI	Will you take one with my camera too? Sis, where’s my camera?
	
NAI NAI				I gave it to Mrs. Gao. It's in her purse.

LITTLE NAI NAI			Where is she?

NAI NAI				I sent her to the hospital to pick up my test results.

UNCLE HAIBIN (O.S.)			Everyone say 'eggplant!' One, two three!

GROUP				Eggplant!

BILLI					Test result pickup?

FEMALE HOSPITAL WORKER		Upstairs.

BILLI					Mrs. Gao!

MRS. GAO				What are you doing here?

BILLI					Did you get them?

MRS. GAO				The test results? Yeah.

MRS. GAO				What's the matter? What's it say?

BILLI					I don't know. I can't read Chinese. Didn't you read it?

MRS. GAO				I can't read. I never went to school.

COPY CENTER MAN	How am I supposed to change this? What do you want to me write here?

LITTLE NAI NAI			Just change it to benign shadows.

COPY CENTER MAN			Benign shadow? What's a benign shadow?

LITTLE NAI NAI			It means it's not fatal!

COPY CENTER MAN			Fine.

NAI NAI				You see I told you I was fine!

BILLI					Don't give me money!

NAI NAI	Take it. Just take it. I gave one to Hao Hao, so I have to give you one too.

BILLI					I didn't get married.

NAI NAI	Even more reason! You're all on your own. And I can't be much help. Take it, my child. And don't spend it on practical things like rent! Buy yourself something nice.

BILLI					I don't want to leave.

NAI NAI	You'll be back. I know you're always thinking of me. But I've been taking my new medicine… and I'm all better! You have work to do. You still have a long road ahead. I'm very proud of you.

BILLI					I didn't get the fellowship.

NAI NAI				Really? You just heard?

BILLI	Last week. I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry.

NAI NAI	I'm not worried. You'll be fine, child. I've walked the path of life and I must tell you you'll encounter difficulties, but you have to keep an open mind. Don't be the bull endless ramming its horns into the corner of the room. Life is not just about what you do it's more about how you do it. Your mind is very powerful. You will succeed.

BILLI					Are you really OK?

NAI NAI				Yes, really! Why would I lie to you? Stupid child!

LITTLE NAI NAI (O.S.)			Let’s go you'll miss your flight!

JIAN					You don't need to come down!

NAI NAI				I’m fine! I’m coming!

BILLI					Don't cry, Nai Nai.

NAI NAI				I’m not, I’m not. Stupid child! I'm not crying.

NAI NAI				You don't cry.

BILLI					I'm not crying.

BILLI					I'll visit you again.

NAI NAI	I know. We'll see each other very soon. Go on, let's not drag this out anymore. Otherwise I can't take it. Hurry up!

NAI NAI				Go on, get in the car!

JIAN					Take care, Ma.

NAI NAI				I know, I will.

HAIYAN				Go back inside, Ma!

NAI NAI				I'll go after you get in the car!

JIAN (O.S.)				Go upstairs, Ma! It's chilly!

NAI NAI				Hurry up, you’ll miss your flight!

NAI NAI				Be good, my child.
