MIKE	Then I’ll get my own crew?

DUKE	Well, let’s call this one last whatever the-fuck-it-is unto Caesar, okay? 

DUKE	Then I’ll set you up somewhere real cush. 

DUKE	Maybe a bar somewhere pushing hooch, right? 

DUKE	Titties flapping in your grill all day. 

DUKE	How’s that? How’s that?

MIKE	All right.

DUKE	Oompa Loompa! Take these boys out back.

NA GUY	I don’t owe that bitch anything, no alimony.

NA GUY	Don’t let nobody tell you different.

PARKER	All right. All right. Easy.

NA GUY	Why would I keep tabs on that skinny ass cunt anyhow? 

PARKER	Because your daughter needs a momma, that’s why.

DUKE	Hello there, Detective.

DETECTIVE KING	So...

DETECTIVE KING	you know anything about the Mexican burritos...

DETECTIVE KING	I got on ice down at the morgue right now?

DUKE	Hi. 

DUKE	You know, when I was a boy...

DUKE	I always had my tacos with pig. 

DETECTIVE KING	That was dirty. 

DETECTIVE KING	Yeah, well it seems these were no small-timers, but cartel in transit. 

DETECTIVE KING	Your boy’s fucking with a cat. It’s out of your league.

DUKE	You think anyone gives a rat’s ass about a bunch of dead fatoh foot soldiers? 

DETECTIVE KING	Someone's going to have to take control... 

DETECTIVE KING	or it's going to be a fucking war zone.

DUKE	War’s good business. It's good business. 

DUKE	The CIA was involved in the Golden Triangle in Burma. 

DUKE	You might be too young to remember that. 

DUKE	They were smuggling opium on Air America.

DUKE	They were financing special ops, secret wars.

DETECTIVE KING	Yeah.

DUKE	Yeah.

DUKE	I mean, trafficking in Mexico is not new, sweetheart.

DETECTIVE KING	Yeah, and all along the way, you poison the inner city to control the people.

DETECTIVE KING	I saw that shit growing up. Contras and crack in the ghettos.

DUKE	Can you stop being so angry for a second? 

DUKE	ou know, the problem with America is it has an identity crisis. 

DUKE	Reality is run by a bunch of TV stars these days. 

DUKE	We all have to work for someone. 

DUKE	Those bricks that are coming through this country...

DUKE	they’re wrapped in the American flag, wall or no wall. 

DUKE	Cowboys killed the Mexicans and the Indians...

DUKE	they brought in the slaves to do all the dirty work. 

DUKE	Now go do your job, darling.

DETECTIVE KING	You ask any rhinestone Guido, and he'll tell you... 

DETECTIVE KING	all empires fall.

DETECTIVE KING	Guess we'll call this reparations.

MARCUS	What do you want from me, huh? 

MARCUS	Christ, you’re drunk.

PARKER	You always were perceptive.

MARCUS	You creep around my fucking house at night.

MARCUS	You want to tell me what the fuck that is? 

MARCUS	I sent you letters.

PARKER	When I was 17, and I never even opened them.

MARCUS	Fuck. 

MARCUS	Because why should you give a shit about me? 

MARCUS	I fucked your life up, I fucked your mother’s life up...

PARKER	You let her OD.

MARCUS	It should’ve been me! 

MARCUS	I’ve never lied about that. 

MARCUS	I’ve never shirked that fucking responsibility. 

MARCUS	That was on me, okay? 

MARCUS	All I was trying to do was let you know... 

MARCUS	what it was like when I came back.

MARCUS	I could never explain that to you.

MARCUS	You wouldn’t get it.Nobody else got it. 

MARCUS	The country didn’t fucking get it, okay? 

MARCUS	I mean, I came back from My Lai...

MARCUS	and the fucking Tet...
 
MARCUS	and the blood of so many innocent fucking people. 

MARCUS	And what did I come back to? 

MARCUS	I came back to a country that was torn the fuck apart from within...

MARCUS	and a dead fucking city where nobody has pride anymore...

MARCUS	where no one has any fucking dreams anymore. 

MARCUS	And you have an opportunity to get something done. 

MARCUS	You're a person. You have a major ingredient of hope. 

MARCUS	Hope, you asshole! Don't you see that?

MARCUS	Parker, who the fuck are you?

MINISTER	as high as the heavens are above the earth. 

MINISTER	So great is his steadfast love towards those who feared him. 

MINISTER	And as far as the east is from the west... 

MINISTER	so far has he removed our transgressions.

MINISTER	Surely, the Lord is in this place, and I did not... 

MINISTER	This is none otherthan the house of God... 

MINISTER	and this is the gate of heaven.

DUKE	I'm sorry, mamasita. 

DUKE	He's in the Lord's hands now, okay? 

DUKE	I'm going to take care of the rest.

HECTOR’S MOM	I want to see my boy one more time. 

DUKE	Okay? You remember, you see the world for what’s in your heart.

DUKE	You take care of yourself.

DUKE	That true?

MIKE	Look, I got the package at my house.

DUKE	You owe me a replacement, Raza.

MIKE	This wasn’t on me, and you fucking know it.

MIKE	You’ll get your package, and me and you, we’re fucking square.

MIKE	I do. I know my rights.

DETECTIVE KING	Well, you’re on probation. You got no rights.

MIKE	My wife’s sleeping upstairs after her night shift, okay? 

MIKE	So let’s just keep it down a little bit.

DETECTIVE KING	 All right. 

DETECTIVE KING	Where were you two nights ago?

MIKE	I was here.

DETECTIVE BACHMAN	We got you on closed-circuit driving your Caddy around K-Town...

DETECTIVE BACHMAN	near a crime scene with four dead men, Mexican traffickers.

DETECTIVE KING	Kind of guys you used to associate with.

MIKE	It's fucking St. Louis, guys. Anywhere you go is a crime scene.

DETECTIVE BACHMAN	Why would you be out that way? 

MIKE	Couldn't sleep, took a drive. 

MIKE	I'm training for the Daytona 500. 

DETECTIVE KING	In that piece of shit? 

DETECTIVE KING	And I'm sure your wife can verify your whereabouts?

SHARON	We are not colleagues. 

SHARON	Do not interfere in these people's lives, and go and get yourself some help.

PARKER	Fuck.

PARKER	Make your move.

GARY	All right.

PARKER	God damn it, Gary, make your fucking move.

GARY	You want to talk about something?

PARKER	No, just move.

GARY	No, you move. You move your head out of the hole it’s in...

GARY	because I don’t know. Lately, you

PARKER	They fired me, Gary.

GARY	Oh, no. 

GARY	I love you, man, but that ain't easy me to say.

PARKER	I hear that shit...

DAHLIA	You play here now?

PARKER	I guess so.

DAHLIA	You should play another table.

PARKER	I’m worried about Ashley.

DAHLIA	You don’t need to be. Her dad’s back. Everything’s fine.

PARKER	I’m also concerned for you.

DAHLIA	Okay, well, that’s very nice of you.

PARKER	Mike, you know he’s no good for Ashley to be around.

DAHLIA	All right, thanks for telling me what my family needs.

PARKER	I’ve seen so many families. 

PARKER	I’ve seen what their future’s held...

PARKER	the cliff that they’re about to fall off of...

PARKER	and there’s nothing I can do to stop it, but I still got to try, Dahlia.

DAHLIA	Sharon called. 

DAHLIA	You’re not our case worker anymore.

TERRY	There ain't no justice. 

TERRY	The only real color divide is green, and the house always wins.

PARKER	Man, times are changing. Or I’m getting old. 

PARKER	I’ve been thinking a lot about the kids I grew up with back at the home.

PARKER	Some of them doing 10 years for some minor possession wraps.

TERRY	Today, they’d be legit dealers working at dispensaries...

TERRY	wearing rainbow unicorn shirts and shit.

TERRY	You was The Champ. 

TERRY	You know, I know you got it in you to fight for them kids.

ASHLEY	Hi, Dad. 

MIKE	Hey. 

MIKE	You think you could do a big favor for Dad today? 

ASHLEY	Maybe. 

MIKE	Maybe?

MIKE	I need you take something to school for me. 

MIKE	Uncle Louis is going to pick it up at recess. 

ASHLEY	I haven't seen Louis in a while. 

MIKE	He's been working a lot.

MIKE	Guess what? 

ASHLEY	What? 

MIKE	If you do this, there's going to be something pretty special...

MIKE	waiting for you when you get home. 

ASHLEY	Like what?

MIKE	I don't know. You're going to have to wait and see. 

ASHLEY	More video games? 

MIKE	Maybe.

DAHLIA	Ashley, I want you ready in five.

MIKE	Hey, this is the most important part, though, okay? 

MIKE	This has to stay between me and you, all right? 

MIKE	It has to be our little secret. 

MIKE	We can't tell Mom. 

ASHLEY	What is it? 

MIKE	It's a present for her, because she's the best, right? 

ASHLEY	Totally.

DAHLIA	but jump on the phone every now and then. 

DAHLIA	You got your dad's eyes. 

DAHLIA	You ever talk to him?

PARKER	Thanks.

DAHLIA	The cops just pulled me over. What the fuck is going on?

MIKE	This is what they do, babe. It’s nothing.

DAHLIA	Oh, don’t tell me it’s nothing. 

DAHLIA	The last time this happened, they ripped through our apartment...

DAHLIA	You’re putting her at risk, Mike.

MIKE	I’m not fucking doing anything. Where the fuck are you?

DAHLIA	Yeah, what are you going to do? Rough me up again?

MIKE	You and I both know what you’re doing is kidnapping. 

MIKE	All I have to do is call Duke, and the cops will find you within an hour, right?

DAHLIA	Fuck you! You won’t do shit.

PARKER	Listen, we can go to the cops.

DAHLIA	No, no. No, we’re not going to the cops. 

DAHLIA	He’s going to say that I kidnapped her. 

DAHLIA	Even if they don’t believe him, they’re still going to come here...

DAHLIA	and say that she’s in a bad situation. 

DAHLIA	Can we call social services?

MARCUS	I thought you'd kill me when I wasn't looking. 

PARKER	So you're an optimist. 

MARCUS	And you're a wit.

PARKER	Mind if I use your shower? 

MARCUS	Absolutely, be my guest. 

DAHLIA	How do you know Parker?

MARCUS	Hopefully, things will be a little better now. 

DAHLIA	You knew him in the foster system? 

MARCUS	Before. I knew his mother. 

MARCUS	How do you know him? 

DAHLIA	Well, he looks after me and Ashley.

PARKER	Yeah, what are you talking 

MARCUS	The drugs!

MARCUS	Drugs, D-R-U-G-S, smack. 

MARCUS	That's why you're not going to the police. 

PARKER	No fucking drugs. What are you even talking about? 

MARCUS	What, in the little girl's backpack, you put fucking drugs. 

MARCUS	What is the matter with you? 

MARCUS	She’s 12 fucking years old, you asshole! 

MARCUS	Why don't you just give it to him, be done with it? 

MIKE	Yeah, it's Mike.

PARKER	There's a deal to be made. 

MIKE	Oh, is that right?

PARKER	Tomorrow morning, 8:00 A.M., Forest Park, Pagoda Square. 

PARKER	I give you the dope, the girls go their separate way. 

PARKER	You let them go, you get your stuff. 

MIKE	So you're trying to buy me off?

PARKER	If that's what you want to call it. 

MIKE	How do I know you haven't called the cops? 

PARKER	Same reason I know you haven't. 

PARKER	We both want what's best for Dahlia and Ashley. 

MIKE	All right, just stay the fuck out of our lives. 

PARKER	No can do, brother. So what's it going to be? 

PARKER	Tomorrow morning at 8:00 A.M.?

THEN MIKE	Yeah, I'll be there.

MIKE	Yo, Duke, we got them. 

DUKE	You better hope so, man, because this shit's getting sloppy. 

DUKE	I had to pay off one of my dicks at the force...

DUKE	to keep their heads down... 

DUKE	not to see these Mexicans you guys whacked.

MIKE	And you’re sure we're in the clear from the cartel? 

DUKE	As sure as a Chinaman chain smokes. 

PARKER	What are you doing up?

ASHLEY	I don’t know.

ASHLEY	I guess I wanted to play games.

PARKER	It’s going to be okay.

MARCUS	I couldn’t sleep.

MARCUS	You want a drink?

PARKER	Yeah, sure.

MARCUS	Well, what are you doing up, ma’am?

ASHLEY	I couldn’t sleep.

MARCUS	Yeah, me either. 

MARCUS	You never knocked before. I'd a let you right in. 

PARKER	Mom wouldn't have wanted it, that's what always stopped me. 

MARCUS	She was never wrong about me. 

MARCUS	I deserved every goddamn thing she ever went after me for. 

MARCUS	I saw your last fight. You got fucked. 

MARCUS	You won it fair and square...
 
MARCUS	and they took it from you.

MARCUS	But you did a unique thing.

MARCUS	You found a way of life where you actually can help people...

MARCUS	not to fall as hard and far as you did. 

MARCUS	And I'll tell you something. 

MARCUS	You may think this is all bullshit and doesn't matter...

MARCUS	but I'm fucking proud of you. 

PARKER	You even know what family is? 

PARKER	Because I see them every day. 

PARKER	Battlefields of people's fucking broken dreams and promises. 

MARCUS	I've always been selfish... 

MARCUS	but you and me, we cry alone. 

MARCUS	And you know what else we do? 

MARCUS	We stand up and take it like fucking men. 

MARCUS	You have a dream, follow it. 

MARCUS	Well, that's what I did. 

MARCUS	And by the time I woke up and realized the responsibility I had to a family...

MARCUS	I was on a showcase tour halfway across Europe. 

MARCUS	Got a girlfriend, tried to make it work...

MARCUS	couldn't... 

MARCUS	was alone...
 
MARCUS	and I didn't like it. 

MARCUS	So I started the letters...
 
MARCUS	to try and find my way back in to you. 

PARKER	I was married for a couple years.

PARKER	Best, most secure place I've ever been in my life... 

PARKER	until she split. 

PARKER	After that, I was out of the spotlight of the fight games. 

PARKER	She lost interest or I don’t know, I pushed her away... 

PARKER	but I let her.

PARKER	I guess I inherited being a lone wolf from someone. 

ASHLEY	Parker! 

ASHLEY	Mom! Mom!

DAHLIA	Ashley!

MIKE	Go! 

MIKE	Dahlia, I want my dope, and I want my daughter!

MIKE	Ashley! I want my dope.

PARKER	You let us go, you get to keep the dope.

PARKER	Get back! Get back!

LOUIS	Go, I’ll cover you.

PARKER	Jesus!

MIKE	but know you died for nothing. 

MIKE	Put it in the car.
