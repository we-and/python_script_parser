TOM	Why are you trying to buy out my land? Right next to the forest, my stables.

MITCH	And my cottage.

NATASHA	What about the bore hole in the forest?

JULIA	We need to find a primary new water source for the expansion.

DAN	Here, look.

DAN	Hexronn’s moving into single use plastics.

CALEB	hat do I say, hey everybody, I’m gay?

ISSIE	Yeah, when you’re ready.

RICHARD	Have you heard the name Marchetti?

TOM	Marchetti?

FRANKIE	Hi, I’m Frankie Pines.

FRANKIE	She’s registered to me, you just saw that.

ISSIE	Blaze is wild, you know she is.

TOM	She can’t be Issie. She’s chipped.

FRANKIE	You’ll never believe this, the kid’s done a runner on the horse.

ADAM	Yep, I’m on it, I’m on it, go.

DORA	Open the hold.

ISSIE	Hey, are you ok?

FRANKIE	Take it to the others. I’ll tell them we’re ready to move on this.

ADAM	What about the girl?

FRANKIE	Just leave her.

NATASHA	Hey, thanks for letting me stay, I couldn’t face dad.

ISSIE	Why are you dressed like a fortune teller?

NATASHA	It’s your grans, she liked forced me into it when I woke up, apparently I need to release my inner gold dust woman. I didn’t want to offend her.

ISSIE	You know you can stay for however long you like. Right?

NATASHA	I can’t believe dad, about the plastics and, he’s such a liar. He’s been texting me all morning.

ISSIE	It’s ten o’clock.

NATASHA	Yeah, you probably needed the sleep. What were you dreaming about, you were making noises all night.

ISSIE	It was about Blaze, and the rest of the herd, they’re in danger, I know it. It’s that Frankie whatever, she’s got to be stopped. I need to talk to Tom.

NATASHA	Ok, let’s do it. I’m in.

ISSIE	Ah, do you want to borrow some clothe?

NATASHA	Yes.

AMANDA	Hey mum.

MITCH	Did you fill up the car?

AMANDA	Oh, um…

MITCH	Amanda.

AMANDA	Oh I will, I will. I promise, so, what’s all this?

MITCH	This is everything I could get my hands on, you know, about all the land, Hexronn have bought up.

ISSIE	We moving out?

AMANDA	No, we’re just, wait, where are you going?

ISSIE	To the stables.

AMANDA	No, Is. I want you here today, with me. With us.

ISSIE	Mum, I have to.

AMANDA	Issie, you were concussed yesterday after galloping off, which even, by your standards…

ISSIE	My standards. What does that mean?

NATASHA	I should. Should I go?

MITCH	They’ll work it out, possum, what happened to the dress?

ISSIE	I need to find Blaze.

AMANDA	Oh, Issie.

ISSIE	She was stolen, mum, I saw it. Frankie took her.

AMANDA	Yeah, that Frankie is Blaze’s legal owner.

ISSIE	No, she’s not. Why don’t you believe me?

AMANDA	Tom spoke to Frankie, she doesn’t know where Blaze is.

ISSIE	She’s lying.

AMANDA	Issie. I’m sorry, but, no.

ISSIE	What?

AMANDA	You’re staying home today. Don’t look at me like that. Hey, this isn’t a punishment. You need to rest. Your friends can come here. Issie, wait. I’m sorry about Blaze, ok, I really am. I know it’s hard, but, you have to leave this alone.

DAN	You wanna what?

ISSIE	Call Frankie. Meet her, face to face.

CALEB	She’s not gonna tell you where Blaze is.

ISSIE	No, but I can keep her busy while you search her place for clues. There’s gotta be something that can tell us where she’s keeping Blaze and the rest of the horses. Look, I know you think this is a bad idea, but, this is all we’ve got, bad ideas.

STELLA	How we supposed to call her? We don’t have her number.

CAROLINE	Or know where she’s staying.

CALEB	Yeah, there’s a few holes here.

DAN	Her number’s on the bill of sale. In Tom’s office.

STELLA	Cool, let’s ask him for it.

NATASHA	If we ask, he’s gonna want to know why and we’ll say what? Oh, we want to lure her out and ransack her hotel room. He’s gonna love that.

DAN	Yeah, the adults don’t believe in us now, not after barn night, we have credibility issues.

CAROLINE	So, we’re sneaking into Tom’s office.

CALEB	Oh, good.

ISSIE	We do it now.

ISSIE (VOICE OVER)	Stella, I need you and Dan to go to the stables, you cannot let Tom catch you. Just get the number.

ISSIE	Ok, so, who do the adults think is most trustworthy. Out of all of us.

CALEB	Oh guys, ok, maybe they do listen to me a bit more, I can talk to them on their wavelength.

ISSIE	Great, then you can get intel.

CALEB	Oh, I see, no, I don’t, I don’t do well under pressure, maybe, maybe Dan can…

ISSIE	I need you to go into the store, everyone in KP passes through there, right, so if anyone knows where Frankie is staying, it’s Miri. All you have to say is…

CALEB	I’m looking for Frankie because she left her sunglasses behind at the stables.

ISSIE	Miri will tell you everything.

ISSIE	Ok, so I’m gonna text Frankie and I’m gonna tell her that we have information on Blaze.

STELLA	Say you want to go to the police.

NATASHA	Yeah, yeah, yeah, but keep it open ended and she’ll be worried.

CAROLINE	I’ll do it, I’ll meet with Frankie.

ISSIE	Really, ‘cause she could be dangerous.

CAROLINE	Look, you said Caleb could help because he was the most trustworthy. We’ll, I’m the most.

DAN	Loud.

CALEB	Annoying.

ISSIE	All of it.

STELLA	Tall?

CAROLINE	I was gonna say talkative.

NATASHA	Sorry.

CAROLINE	Caleb, you call me a motor mouth. That’s my thing, nobody else tells stories as well as me.

CALEB	True.

CAROLINE	And Frankie and I totally vibed. I can keep her talking forever.

DAN	I guess if you’re gonna meet her at the store, it won’t be too dangerous.

NATASHA	You’re our secret weapon.

ISSIE	Ok.

MITCH	This is, gibberish. If only I had a daughter that was a lawyer who could help me.

AMANDA	Well, consultancy fees aren’t cheap, you know?

MITCH	Neither are avocados. I mean, it looks to me like Hexronn have bought up lots of the forest, but that would be…

AMANDA	No, they haven’t bought lots of it.

MITCH	Well good.

AMANDA	They bought all of it.

MITCH	Have they? Why would they need that much land?

CALEB	Hello, hello. Just, ah…

AMANDA	Was that weird?

MITCH	Those kids are up to something, I know it.

CAROLINE	How do you spell rendezvous?

ISSIE	Just say meet.

CALEB	I got it, she’s staying at, a holiday rental. Just out of town.

ISSIE	Send it.

FRANKIE	Can you believe dad made me stay here? This place is feral as.

FRIEND	I thought he was loaded.

FRANKIE	Yeah, and super-tight. He wanted me to blend in, whatever.

FRANKIE	Babe, hang on.

STELLA	Hey guys, give me your phones.

NATASHA	Why?

STELLA	So I can set up a tracking app.

ISSIE	Wow, that’s not stalkery.

STELLA	It can link up our phones.

NATASHA	So everyone can see where everyone is. Cool.

STELLA	Except me, I dropped my phone in a grain silo this morning.

NATASHA	Hold on, sorry, I just, never mind. Dad. Are you avoiding me? Blah, blah.

ISSIE	It’s ok to be angry, just maybe talk to him?

NATASHA	Why? What’s he gonna say? Sorry. Like that means anything.

ISSIE	I know what he did, that, yeah, it was stupid.

NATASHA	He is stupid.

ISSIE	Yeah, well, even when they are idiots, dad’s matter. Go talk to him.

NATASHA	But I said I’d help.

ISSIE	Oh, we’ve got it. Honest.

CAROLINE	The police seem extreme, let’s meet at the cafe for hot chocolate and a chat. Thirty minutes. Hot chocolate? What a creep.

ISSIE	Caroline. Stall Frankie for as long as you can, Dan, Caleb, go with her, keep watch.

DAN	Yeah, good. Oh um, hey, um. I like your room.

ISSIE	Um, thanks.

NATASHA	Issie, your mum said she’s not letting you out the door.

ISSIE	Guess I won’t use it then.

SAM	Hey, you wanna stay with your friends, fine, but you answer your phone when I call, alright.

NATASHA	Don’t have a go at me, dad. I was coming to find you.

SAM	Oh really? Why?

NATASHA	We found pellets, dad, the kind used to make plastic bottles. Treacle ate them and nearly died.

SAM	I don’t know what you think you found, you and your friends are very eco-conscious, which is great…

NATASHA	Wow, that’s not patronising.

SAM	I’m just saying that it’s complicated when you’re an adult and you’re trying…

NATASHA	When I’m an adult, I’m going to make sure I don’t lie to the people I love, which, as a concept, doesn’t feel that complicated.

SAM	Where did you find this?

NATASHA	Dan and Caleb found it on Forest Road.

SAM	I don’t know anything about this.

NATASHA	Plastic, dad? You promised you wouldn’t, you’re a liar.

SAM	No, I didn’t lie to you.

NATASHA	Well, someone lied to you then.

SAM	Yes, yes, I’m beginning to see that. I found something else. They’re planning to ship it abroad, so that’s why that want to use plastic.

NATASHA	Ah, that would make sense.

SAM	But they’d need a whole second plant to do that, it’d have to be huge.

NATASHA	Well where would they put it?

SAM	Well, if I was them, I’d put it next to the primary water source.

NATASHA	But that’s.

SAM	I have to get down there.

NATASHA	I want to come with you.

SAM	Ok, I’d like that.

ISSIE	This is the place Caleb said.

CALEB	Just keep her busy. That’s all you have to do.

CAROLINE	I know, I know, stop worrying.

CALEB	How can you eat?

DAN	I can always eat.

STELLA	This place is gross.

ISSIE	Yeah, it suits her.

STELLA	Can’t see any wild horses.

ISSIE	No, well she’s probably not keeping them here.

ISSIE	Come on. Let’s look inside.

ISSIE	We search everything.

FRANKIE	Caroline. I’m so glad you texted.

CAROLINE	It was my civic duty.

FRANKIE	So, you said my horse was stolen, you have evidence?

ISSIE	We’re missing something. I’m gonna check the other room.

CALEB	I wonder what they’re talking about?

DAN	Looks serious, aye.

CAROLINE	But, ‘cause I got diarrhoea, I had to hide my undies in the forest, and then the orienteering group found them and cos my mum had written my initials on the tag, everyone knew they were mine. I just feel like I can tell you anything.

FRANKIE	Alright, Caroline, can we talk about Darcy?

CAROLINE	Oh, you mean Blaze?

FRANKIE	Blaze. Sure. You said you were going to the Police.

CAROLINE	Oh, yeah. Big time. The whole situation, Blaze being stolen.

FRANKIE	I mean, I’m not doubting you, but you said you had evidence, right?

CAROLINE	Totally do.

FRANKIE	Well, what evidence, what is it?

CAROLINE	We know, who stole Blaze.

FRANKIE	You do?

CAROLINE	He calls himself, the Goblin.

FRANKIE	What?

CAROLINE	Yeah, you see, my dad, he’s part of the Air Force, but like, not the New Zealand Air Force, ‘cause we only have one plane, the International Air Force, and he has access to this military grade drone, I’ve been using it to run field calls, that’s when I found out what he was doing. Adam can’t get away with this, not while…

FRANKIE	Adam? Who’s Adam?

CAROLINE	What?

FRANKIE	You said Adam.

CAROLINE	Did I? I meant, the Goblin.

FRANKIE	Ok, we’re done.

CAROLINE	Maybe we could talk a little longer?

FRANKIE	No.

CALEB	That can’t be good. This is way too early, she’s gonna catch Issie and Stella. Dan, text Issie. Now.

FRANKIE	You little mongrel.

STELLA	Nothing under the bed.

ISSIE	Nothing in there.

STELLA	Ha. Look at this. Vampire chicklet.

ISSIE	Ok, this woman is damaged.

ISSIE	Oh, it’s Dan. Frankie’s ditched Caroline, she’s on her way back. No, we can’t leave, not yet. We need more time.

STELLA	What’s this?

ISSIE	Rachel Marchetti. So she’s not Frankie Pines at all.

STELLA	We should send this to Tom.

ISSIE	Yeah, but then he’ll know we’ve been up to stuff.

STELLA	At least he’ll know Frankie’s a fake.

ISSIE	Ok, send him a picture. I’m gonna search the kitchen.

STELLA	Ok.

TOM	Marchetti.

STELLA	Anything?

STELLA	Ok, we better go then.

ISSIE	I know.

STELLA	Your phone Issie.

ISSIE	What?

STELLA	I must have dropped it. It was in my pocket, in the bedroom. Sorry.

ISSIE	Ok, go, get the others.

STELLA	But…

MITCH	Hey, this could be something. Kauri Point Herd.

AMANDA	What?

AMANDA	Henceforth, the forest shall be protected homeland of the free roaming Kauri Point Herd, for as long as the horses remain. It shall not be lawful for any persons to disturb or destroy the fauna and flora within the forest. Any person offending against any of the provisions on this section shall be liable. So, they can’t do anything to the land if the horses are there. Mum, do you think the herd was really out there?

MITCH	This is exactly what Issie’s been trying to tell us.

AMANDA	The barn.

MITCH	Yeah. So they were there, somebody must have moved them. Hexronn.

AMANDA	Sam.

AMANDA	Issie.

CAROLINE	Oh, I panicked, I forgot my talking points.

DAN	But then, bam. Custard in the face, what a legend.

CALEB	Not really.

DAN	Yes you are, dude, come on, say it. I’m a legend.

CALEB	Actually, I’m…

DAN	Dude. I’m a legend.

DAN & CAROLINE	I’m a legend. I’m a legend. I’m a legend. I’m a legend.

DAN	I’m a legend.

CALEB	I’m, gay. I’m gay. Um, so, yeah, just, you know, by the way, I don’t know if that, we don’t, we don’t have to talk about it or anything, I…

DAN	Dude. You egg. I thought you were gonna say something bad for a second. Your face. That’s great.

CALEB	Don’t look at me like that, it’s weird. Stop.

CAROLINE	You are a legend.

DAN	Where’s Issie?

CALEB	What’s wrong?

STELLA	It’s all my fault.

FRANKIE	She said the name, Adam. No, don’t tell me not to… the police. No, she wants to, no, she, no, you listen to me, you get the vet on site now. If he wants to get paid, he will. ‘cause they need a final inspection before they travel…

ISSIE	Equine blood tests, clear. Export approval, Newhill Dock to Port Wallaroo.

FRANKIE	Well do that then. Yes.

FRANKIE	Congratulations Adam, you have the ability to think independently.

MITCH	We go into town. We tell everybody. Somebody has to know something about the horses.

AMANDA	Issie, she does whatever she pleases.

MITCH	If you call, you’ll only say something you’ll regret later.

AMANDA	I’m just texting her. I’m just gonna tell her to come home. Nicely.

MITCH	Well tell her about the horses, tell her we believe her.

AMANDA	I’ll tell her about that when she dains to come home.

MITCH	Give it here.

AMANDA	Mum.

FRANKIE	Yes, I’ll be there in fifteen. Loser.

FRANKIE	Issie, guess what? You were right. The KP Herd are real, found proof. Hexronn wanted the forest, so got rid of them. If you find them, Hexronn must stop.

FRANKIE	Oh, and this one’s from mum, oh, Issie, windows are not doors, get home, now. Issie, Issie, Issie, you send your friend to meet me, then you come here to, what? Find your horse? Smart. Then you leave your phone behind, naw, scratch, scratch, little mouse, where could you be?

FRANKIE	Ok, out. Now.

ISSIE	I know you’ve got the herd.

FRANKIE	Hilarious. Because, Issie, I don’t see any horses around here.

ISSIE	Well, Frankie, or is it Rachel, I guess you wouldn’t mind me telling everyone you’re keeping the herd at Newhill Dock, right?

FRANKIE	You really are annoying.

ISSIE	And you read Vampire chicklet. Sad.

FRANKIE	Get back here.

ISSIE	Let. Me. Go.

FRANKIE	Gladly.

ISSIE	No. Let me out.

FRANKIE	Oh, Issie, you’re locked up just like your horse. She’s fast, Blaze, yeah, Dad’s gonna get a lot of cash for her.

ISSIE	She doesn’t belong to you.

FRANKIE	She’s far too valuable for a little Bieber like you to be riding round on.

ISSIE	I’m gonna call the Police.

FRANKIE	Cool, well, the herd’s only in New Zealand for another forty-five minutes and you have no phone or car, so, good luck with that. Oh, the cleaners come Thursday. Ciao.

ISSIE	No. Wait. Wait. Wait.

SAM	I just gotta make a quick call.  Hi, get me Julia, why not? Ok. I need to pop into the office, see Julia.

NATASHA	Dad? What it this?

ISSIE	No.

ISSIE	Newhill Docks. It’s so far.

ISSIE	You’re here.

ISSIE	I know where they are.
