VLADIK	Let's do this.

KANE	Let's see what we got here.

KANE	The fuck is this?

RHONA	In this business, there is no room for mistakes.

RHONA	Any wrong turn and innocent people can pay the price.

RHONA	These streets and five tasks stand between me and seeing my son again.

JIMMY	Get the money and find the guns or I'm a dead man.

THUG	We're on it, Jimmy.

MAN CALLS OUT	Hey, you, stop!

RHONA	David?

DAVID	We still good to meet?

RHONA	I can't talk right now. I'm...

RHONA	I'm busy.

DAVID	I'll meet you at our spot.

RYUU	Rhona.

BETTY	Can I get you anything?

RHONA	Water and coffee... and privacy.

BETTY	Sure thing.

RYUU	She's... she's not eating?

BETTY	No, she's just taking up a table.


BETTY		Anything else?

RHONA	Privacy.

BETTY	That'll be $3.50.

RHONA	I was never here.

BETTY	Refills on me.

CELL PHONE	Office

VLADIK	Enjoying your coffee?

RHONA	I wanna speak to my son.

VLADIK	Not the agreement.

RHONA	We made an agreement?

VLADIK	Complete all your assignments, you not only get to speak to him, you'll have the pleasure of holding him.

RHONA	How do I know

RHONA	How do I know you haven't already killed him?

VLADIK	You don't. 

JIMMY	Fuck, this place is dangerous.

RHONA	Buck up.

RHONA	Where the hell is Richie?

JIMMY	Well, Richie is...

JIMMY	Richie is late, but he'll be here.

RHONA	If you two fuck this up...this won't end well.

RHONA	Understood?

JIMMY	Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

RHONA	Good.

RHONA	I need this money to get Mika out of here.

JIMMY	You must love your son.

RHONA	Yeah, I do. Imagine that.

JIMMY	There's Richie right there. Told you.

RHONA	Stay in the fucking car.

RHONA	I'm serious.

RHONA	Not a sound.

RHONA	Richie, you're late!

RHONA	Let's do this.

KEITEL	That is close enough.

RHONA	You're late.

KEITEL	This city is a nightmare to drive in...

KEITEL	Do you have it?

RHONA	Of course I do. Do you have what we came for?

KEITEL	Why else would I be here? Show me.

RHONA	He wants to see the money.

RICHIE	Let's see the product first.

RHONA	Show us the product first.

KEITEL	Show me the money first.

RHONA	What is this?

KEITEL	I don't trust him. He looks wrong.

RHONA	What's wrong with you? Are you high?

RICHIE	No! Let's do this.

KEITEL	What's wrong with him?

RHONA	One second.

KEITEL	The money, or I go.

RHONA	Just show it to him, okay?

RHONA	He's fine.

RHONA	Look, just get the bag and show him the money.

RHONA	Richie!

RICHIE	Tell him to get on the ground!

KEITEL	What the hell, man!

RHONA	What the hell are you doing!

RICHIE	Get on the ground!

BETTY	I know you said you weren't here, but...the coffee cup is.

BETTY	I'll probably regret asking this, but...are you all right?

RHONA	Allergies. 

BETTY	I don't know their names, but they're not worth it.

BETTY	You best go it alone. They give you any difficulty at all.

RHONA	They won't see the next sunrise.

KANE	Evening, Betty.

KANE	Well, it's a quiet one at that, isn't it?

BETTY	Your powers of observation are astounding.

KANE	How's the yellow-white pie tonight, it's good?

BETTY	Yeah, the lemon merengue's fresh.

KANE	Good. Give me a slice?

KANE	Actually, Betty, make it two, will you?

RHONA	Kane. 

KANE	That's your car out front, am I right?

RHONA	It is tonight.

BETTY	Here you go.

KANE	Oh, Betty, you're a queen!

KANE	Beautiful. Thank you, sweetie.

BETTY	hank you.

KANE	You're gonna love this. This...

KANE	This is another level.

KANE	That's beautiful. 

KANE	You know, it always tastes exactly the same, too.

KANE	They call that "integrity".

KANE	Like the recipe never wavers. Not once.

KANE	You know? It's always the same.

KANE	It's the culinary equivalent of loyalty, I guess.

KANE	It's like, all the ingredients show up...every single time they're called...in exactly the right amounts.

KANE	That's what makes it so...pure and perfect.

KANE	You know what I mean? It's beautiful, right?

KANE	What's the matter, Rhona? You don't eat pie?

KANE	You know, if you don't take it, somebody will.

KANE	Not even a taste, huh?

KANE	Tiny little taste, tip of your tongue.

RHONA	Later.

KANE	Well, then you won't mind if I take it, will you?

KANE	Betty! Can we get this to go, sweetie?

BETTY	Okay.

KANE	Thank you, doll.

KANE	You know, what I could do for you, and I'd be willing...I could swing by your place and deliver that pie to you.

KANE	Any way you want it.

RHONA	Mm.

KANE	Wherever you want it delivered.

KANE	However many times... you want it delivered.

RHONA	It's all right. Thank you.

KANE	You wouldn't wanna wreck that beautiful chassis of yours, would you?

KANE	I don't imagine that delicious ass got that way by eating pie.

KANE	Am I right?

KANE	You know what I like best about you, Rhona?

KANE	You never once asked me to cuddle.

KANE	It's just straight to business with you. All business, all day.

KANE	And I fucking respect that. 

RHONA	I don't like to cuddle.

KANE	Good. 

BETTY	Here you go.

KANE	Thank you, Betty.

KANE	You're a queen, darling.

KANE	Listen to me. I want you to be careful out there, all right?

KANE	That's a lot of machine under your right foot.

KANE	Don't get too heavy on it.

KANE	You don't want the back end stepping out, opposite lock.

KANE	It's where the danger happens, right? 

RHONA	Thank you. 

KANE	You be good, huh?

HANNIBAL	Any one of you boys seen this guy?

BOUNCER	I'm fine. How are you?

HANNIBAL	I don't care how you are.

HANNIBAL	Have you seen him or not?

BOUNCER	It's polite to say, "Excuse me, can you help me?"

BOUNCER #2	He's put his phone away. What are you gonna do, try something?

BOUNCER #2	Get outta here, man. There's nothing here for you.

YOUNG WOMAN	Who you looking for?

HANNIBAL	This guy. You know him?

YOUNG WOMAN	Oh, Richie. I know that guy.

YOUNG WOMAN	He hangs out with this other guy named Dominic. 

YOUNG WOMAN	Usually they're at the diner this time of night.

HANNIBAL	Thank you very much. Oh, sorry about the mess.

VAGRANT REACTING	Oh, shit!

VAGRANT	Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait. I'm just looking for a few extra bucks.

VAGRANT	You got something?

RHONA	What?

VLADIK	Do you think you can alter the rules?

RHONA	Is that what I think?

VLADIK	Don't at any time believe you have control of the situation. Ever.

RHONA	I just stopped for a cup of coffee.

VLADIK	You have four more envelopes.

VLADIK	Five hours, 21 minutes and 9 seconds to work with.

KANE	Dominic! Dominic! Dominic!

KANE	How you doing, buddy? You good?

DOMINIC	Yeah.

KANE	I hear that.

DOMINIC	Yeah. How you been?

KANE	I've been good. You?

DOMINIC	Okay.

KANE	Have a seat.

DOMINIC	Hey, I'm all right!

KANE	Yeah? 

KANE	Just talk to me. What you been up to?

DOMINIC	I ain't been doing nothing.

HANNIBAL	Do not lie, Dominic.

HANNIBAL	You know it's only going worse for you.

KANE	Dominic, Dominic. 

DOMINIC	There must be some mistaken situation, because I ain't been doing nothing!

DOMINIC	Swear, Kane, nothing!

KANE	So you...

KANE	you-you're saying I make mistakes?

KANE	Is that what you're saying?

DOMINIC	I ain't saying that

KANE	You just fucking said it. You said I make mistakes. That's what you said.

DOMINIC	Well, I didn't mean to say that. No disrespect, Kane. I just

KANE	Where do I find Richie, Dominic?

DOMINIC	Richie?

KANE	Richie, your boy.

KANE	You hang out with Richie. Swap needles. I don't know, maybe you touch fucking dongs.

KANE	I don't know. Where the fuck can I find Richie? Where can I find him?

DOMINIC	Richie! Richie!

KANE	Richie.

DOMINIC	Well, you had me

KANE	Richie. Fucking Richie.

DOMINIC	Richie. I haven't seen Richie in a while.

KANE	What's "a while"? What exactly is "a while"?

KANE	Is that like a week, a month? A fucking millennia?

KANE	What-what-what's "a while"?

DOMINIC	I don't know, Kane. I don't know. Maybe...

DOMINIC	Four days?

KANE	Four days!

KANE	We're gonna go with four days for "a while". I like that.

KANE	I'm gonna go with four days for "a while".

KANE	So, four days ago... where'd you see Richie? Exactly.

DOMINIC	Maybe the-the track or the laundromat, the diner.

DOMINIC	You know, around. Like you do, around.

KANE	Yeah, yeah.

KANE	I'm gonna need a drink. "Around."

KANE	You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna play a game. 

KANE	Think we can do the cigar box here? Grab me the cigar box.

KANE	You like games?

DOMINIC	Yeah.

KANE	You're gonna love this. Look at this.

KANE	So you and I... are gonna do a little bang-bang, okay?

KANE	You go three clicks, and I go three clicks.

KANE	You do three clicks, you fucking walk out of here, right?

KANE	Unless I fucking blow my brains out.

KANE	Sound good to you, Dominic?

DOMINIC	Look, Kane, I swear to you I ain't seen Richie, okay?

DOMINIC	Now, I ain't been doing nothing... and I don't wanna do this.

KANE	You know what? You know what, Dominic?

KANE	Okay, I'm gonna give you a choice here. You can play the game with me...or you can tell me where the fuck I can find Richie.

DOMINIC	I don't know where Richie is.

KANE	Or you can do a dance with my boy here.

KANE	Unfortunately, he's probably not gonna let you lead...and he loves to fucking grab ass.

DOMINIC	Kane, don't make me do this, man.

DOMINIC	You gotta believe me! I'm telling you!

KANE	What's it gonna be, Dom?

DOMINIC	I don't know where Richie is!

DOMINIC	Don't make me do this! Don't make me do this!

KANE	Oh, Dom, I swear to God

DOMINIC	Fuck you, Kane! Fuck you!

KANE	I still believe you! Dom, I believe you!

KANE	Dom, I believe you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

KANE	I believe you, buddy. 

KANE	I believe you, buddy. 

KANE	I believe you were gonna do it.

KANE	You did. You pulled that trigger, didn't you?

KANE	Fucking Dominic pulled that trigger! Have a seat.

KANE	Have a seat. Sit down.

KANE	Look at me, look at me, look at me.

KANE	You think I'm fucking stupid?

DOMINIC	No!

KANE	Pick your fucking head up and look at me.

KANE	Pick your fucking head up! Dom, look at me!

KANE	This is when the game starts, right now.

KANE	But here's the good news.

KANE	That's one. Now it's my turn.

KANE	Okay? It's my turn.

KANE	You ready for this? It's my turn.

KANE	Are you ready? Look at me.

KANE	Open your eyes, Dom! Don't you fucking take your eyes off of me!

KANE	Look at me! Dom!

KANE	Goddamnit! You fucking open your eyes!

KANE	Look! Look! You wanna see this, motherfucker!

KANE	You wanna see it? 

KANE	Fuck!

KANE	You're up. Two more clicks and you walk.

DOMINIC	I can't.

KANE	Yeah, you can.

DOMINIC	I can't!

KANE	Look at me, Dom. You know what I'm gonna do?

KANE	Would you help him, honey? Give him a hand. Help him out.

KANE	Megan's gonna help you, Dom. It's okay, it's okay.

DOMINIC	I can't.

MEGAN	It's gonna be all right.

KANE	Attaboy.

DOMINIC	I don't want to.

KANE	Maybe nobody believed in you when you were a kid. I fucking believe in you, Dom!

KANE	You can do this! I believe in you, buddy.

KANE	You're not a fucking Are you a fucking pussy?

KANE	Not the Dom I know! 

KANE	I believe in you, buddy! Dom, pull it!

KANE	Pull it, motherfucker!

KANE	Do it. Do it.

KANE	You can do it, Dom. Pull it!

KANE	Oh, fucking shit!

KANE	Is that blood on my pool table?

KANE	Wipe the shit off with I don't give a fuck!

KANE	I don't want fucking loser DNA in my house.

MIKA	Are you going to let me go now?

VLADIK	Soon.

MIKA	Why are you doing this?

VLADIK	I have no choice.

MIKA	My mother says we always have a choice.

VLADIK	Does she also tell you you have to live with the consequences?

MIKA	Yeah.

VLADIK	Couple of years...

VLADIK	this will be a story you'll tell your friends.

VLADIK	Eat your sandwich. You'll see your mom soon.

RHONA	Bullshit.

RHONA	I'm not fucking doing this.

RHONA	Fuck you!

RHONA	Did you hear me? Fuck you!

RHONA	Fucking asshole!

SPENCER	Your kid's not here, Rhona.

RHONA	You know I still have to look. And you know I can't just let you do that.

RHONA	That would be a real shame.

SPENCER	Tell you what.

SPENCER	I'm gonna take a smoke break.

SPENCER	I'm gonna be back...in 10 minutes exactly.

RHONA	Cigarettes are bad for you.

SPENCER	Yeah.

SPENCER	So is life.

SPENCER	Hey! I hope you find him.

ELI	Hey. 

ELI	Your kid ain't here.

RHONA	Then where?

ELI	Even if I knew, I couldn't say.

ELI	You going about this all wrong.

ELI	I am not your enemy.

RHONA	Everyone is the enemy tonight.

ELI	I understand that.

ELI	But nothing positive will come from you aiming your weapon at me.

RHONA	I'm willing to find out.

ELI	I prefer we didn't.

ELI	So, if you will.

ELI	Very kind of you.

ELI	Hey, despite what you may believe... we have a code.

ELI	Family is strictly off limits.

ELI	Vladik crossed that line, and he will be dealt with.

RHONA	Doubtful.

ELI	I assure you he will be.

RHONA	I know you have mutual business with Vladik.

ELI	Hey, hey, that ain't none of your business.

RHONA	Eli, we've known one another for a very long time.

RHONA	Don't play me.

ELI	I would never do such a thing.

RHONA	Do you know where my son is, or not?

ELI	I truly don't. 

RHONA	And... if you knew...would you tell me?

ELI	That'd be a question.

RHONA	That is the question.

ELI	Like I said...

RHONA	If anything happens to Mika. If he dies

ELI	I know, I know. You'll come for me.

ELI	Go in peace.

RHONA	What is it?

VLADIK	You won't find answers in our safe house. I suggest you use your time wisely.

RHONA	Well, I want proof of life.

VLADIK	Do the job... and you get your son back.

TEEMU	Ah, it's you.

TEEMU	The older ones are the best.

RHONA	They can be.

TEEMU	And the guns?

RHONA	They've gone astray.

TEEMU	Is that right?

RHONA	Unfortunately.

TEEMU	And why would that be?

RHONA	Things happen.

TEEMU	You were supposed to go do a simple exchange and pick up and deliver four crates to me.

TEEMU	An easy bit of work for you.

TEEMU	And instead you come to me empty-handed.

TEEMU	What am I to do about this?

RHONA	I'm not pleased with how things are going either.

TEEMU	How will Vladik correct this?

RHONA	He's working on it.

TEEMU	Meaning?

RHONA	That I'm working on it.

TEEMU	I see this going two ways.

TEEMU	Return my deposit...or bring me my guns in two days' time...

TEEMU	As you can see I am prepared to hold up my end of the arrangement.

RHONA	There's a third way.

TEEMU	Return my deposit and gift me the guns for the inconvenience?

RHONA	Afraid not.

TEEMU	Are you certain?

RHONA	Very.

TEEMU	Then what?

TEEMU	Perhaps we can negotiate?

RHONA	Not this time.

RHONA	Au revoir.

THUG	Yeah, okay, I'll take care of it.

THUG #2	I got her.

RHONA	Let me speak to my son.

VLADIK	Must we have this conversation every time we speak?

RHONA	What, am I being annoying?

RHONA	Because I want to talk to my son?

VLADIK	Perhaps after your next assignment, as a sign of good faith...I'll give you a moment with Mika.

RHONA	This is all just a game to you, isn't it?

VLADIK	3:31 AM.

VLADIK	You got enough to eat?

MIKA	Why are you worried about my diet?

VLADIK	I'm not worried. I just wanna make sure you get fed.

MIKA	Does he talk?

VLADIK	Ask him.

MIKA	Do you talk?

MIKA	I guess not.

VLADIK	He's a thinker.

MIKA	Where's my mom?

VLADIK	She's running an errand for me.

MIKA	What kind of errand?

VLADIK	Nothing for you to be concerned about.

MIKA	Why, because it's illegal?

VLADIK	What makes you think it's illegal?

MIKA	I'm pretty sure you guys don't have normal jobs.

VLADIK	We work all the same. It's just our hours are a little different.

MIKA	Then why does he have a gun?

VLADIK	It's for your safety.

MIKA	That's something a cop would say.

VLADIK	You got a problem with cops?

MIKA	I guess they're okay.

MIKA	My mom says to never trust a cop or a lawyer.

MIKA	Says they're always looking for ways to take you down.

VLADIK	Well, you can add priests to that list, too.

MIKA	And car salesmen.

VLADIK	Just-just get some rest, okay?

MIKA	You really don't talk.

HANNIBAL		Jimmie. We were wondering when you would surface.

HANNIBAL	Where are the guns?

JIMMIE	I...

JIMMIE	I didn't know what to do, man.

HANNIBAL	You were supposed to highjack Vladik's shipment.

HANNIBAL	And yet... no guns.

JIMMIE	Listen, I gotta speak with Kane. I know he's back there, so...

JIMMIE	Out of my way. I'm not afraid of you.

HANNIBAL	Jimmie, why would you say that?

JIMMIE	That's a good question. I'm glad you asked.

JIMMIE	Because you don't control me when I'm holding a gun.

HANNIBAL	What are you gonna do with it, Jimmie?

JIMMIE	Whatever I want, man! Whatever I need to do.

JIMMIE	Whoa! Hey!

HANNIBAL	Let's put our guns down, Jimmie...

HANNIBAL	and we can talk about it.

JIMMIE	Yeah, let's talk about this.

JIMMIE	You hang out while I'm boots on the ground, slaving!

JIMMIE	Earning so that Kane...can have all this...this fancy shit. This right here.

JIMMIE	This fancy shit!

HANNIBAL	You shouldn't do that, Jimmie.

JIMMIE	Why don't you back up?

HANNIBAL	Okay, Jimmie.

JIMMIE	Why do you keep saying my name, man?

JIMMIE	Stop saying my fucking name. 

HANNIBAL	Why, Jimmie? You don't like your name, Jimmie?

JIMMIE	It's messing with my head. I don't like that.

HANNIBAL	I understand.

JIMMIE	Oh, yeah, you understand, Hannibal?

JIMMIE	You're one of those understanding...

JIMMIE	The Russian, he was fucking-he was stalling, man, and...and the whole deal, it went sideways.

JIMMIE	I didn't know it would go down like this.

JIMMIE	I mean, I like you and I don't wanna have to shoot you in your fucking pretty face.

JIMMIE	I need to speak with Kane, 'cause I just...I just need him to know all this.

RHONA	Shit!

TONY	Hey, Rhona.

RHONA	Tony. How's it going?

TONY	Good. 

TONY	This a social visit?

RHONA	Up to her.

TONY	All right.

TONY	I'll follow you.

LILLIAN	I see you, a gun...a late night visit...and I assume with you... problems.

LILLIAN	Too many to count.

LILLIAN	Why are you here?

RHONA	The cash.

LILLIAN	I made a cash deal to keep the peace.

LILLIAN	Now he sends you to what, take it back?

RHONA	I'm asking. Please.

LILLIAN	Then why the gun? 

LILLIAN	Doesn't seem to me like asking.

RHONA	Insurance.

LILLIAN	Insurance has a price.

LILLIAN	I keep the cash.

LILLIAN	Now...off you go.

LILLIAN	She'll be back.

TONY	Take care.

KANE	Yeah?

MEGAN	It's me.

KANE	What's up?

MEGAN	We found Richie. He's pushing snow to Santos' men tonight.

KANE	Grab Hannibal and the boys and go fetch him, huh?

KANE	Alive.

MEGAN	That will be up to him.

KANE	A-live.

CRIMSON	He said he wants to see us at 4 PM. Is that good?

CLOVER	Best at five. It's too early.

CRIMSON	No, I don't wanna do five.

CRIMSON	Will do 7 PM. Seven PM's fine.

CLOVER	Can't we just go over now instead?

CRIMSON	No, I don't wanna do it right now. We'll do 9 PM tomorrow.

CLOVER	Nine PM it is. Works for me. Nine PM.

CRIMSON	Richie. Richie!

CRIMSON	Richie!

RICHIE	What?

CRIMSON	Company.

RICHIE	Hey, fellas.

RICHIE	Surprise.

HANNIBAL	For you or for us, Richie?

RICHIE	I was, coincidentally, just thinking about you guys.

HANNIBAL	Sure you were.

HANNIBAL	Time to take a ride.

RICHIE	Oh, you know, I appreciate it, but I got a lot of work to do here, so...I'll catch up with you guys later?

HANNIBAL	It's not an invitation.

THUG	Come on.

MEGAN	We've got company. Santos' men.

RICHIE	No! No! Let me go!

RHONA	My son.

VLADIK	We've been through this. You know the rules.

VLADIK	Take out each target associated with the numbered envelope.

VLADIK	Acquire my items. Put the items in the bag.

VLADIK	Then and only then will you see your son.

VLADIK	What part of this doesn't register in your gray matter?

RHONA	I want to speak with my child! Now!

VLADIK	You wanna speak to your child? 

RHONA	Yes.

VLADIK	Start by giving me fire.

RHONA	I want to speak with Mika, that's all.

VLADIK	You heard me.

RHONA	Fuck.

MARTY	This is Ling's.

RHONA	Order for delivery.

MARTY	Go ahead.

RHONA	Number 11. With two fortune cookies.

RHONA	And a hot tea.

MARTY	Any pie to go with it?

RHONA	No.

MARTY	We'll be there soon.

RHONA	What is it?

VLADIK	Use your time wisely. You've barely begun.

VLADIK	It's getting late. Tic-toc.

RHONA	Hello, Santos. 

SANTOS	And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?

RHONA	I want you to give me the drive.

SANTOS	This should get interesting. And why would I do that?

RHONA	Because it's in everyone's best interest.

SANTOS	Everyone's?

RHONA	Yours.

SANTOS	Not my best angle.

RHONA	And not my choice.

SANTOS	Who's then?

RHONA	You know.

SANTOS	Yes, I do.

RHONA	The easy way would be best.

SANTOS	For you.

RHONA	For everyone.

SANTOS	Perhaps. Perhaps not.

SANTOS	You and I go back a long way.

RHONA	Yeah, we do.

SANTOS	Eighteen years.

RHONA 	Sixteen.

SANTOS	Are you correcting me?

RHONA	Reminding you.

SANTOS	Word has it you're on a quest.

RHONA	I'd rather not be.

SANTOS	You know, quests can be life-changing.

RHONA	This could be life-ending.

SANTOS	We don't want that now, do we?

RHONA	No, we don't.

SANTOS	And you think I can help you?

RHONA	I could just take it.

SANTOS	Honest, that's what I've always liked about you.

RHONA	I don't have time to play.

SANTOS	Flaco!

SANTOS	Trae la flash drive para la señorita.

SANTOS	You and I have never had a problem.

RHONA	Not yet, we haven't.

SANTOS	You always kept things on a professional level...never personal.

RHONA	When I could.

SANTOS	You did it right.

SANTOS	That's what people remember, that you can be relied on.

RHONA	I'm not here for you.

SANTOS	That's good to hear. You know...I made copies.

RHONA	I know.

SANTOS	You know, you could've just taken me out.

RHONA	Sixteen years. 

FLACO	I can just finish her off.

SANTOS	Nah. 

SANTOS	Sixteen years.

RHONA	Rain. Chiko.

CHIKO	How was the pie with Kane?

RHONA	I try to avoid sugar.

RAIN	Number 11, just as you requested.

RAIN	Happy?

RHONA	Always.

RHONA	All right, let's do this.

RAIN	All right.

RAIN	So, how's it fit?

RHONA	Like a prom dress.

RAIN	You got the guns. Take this as a receipt.

RAIN	Good luck, Rhona.

VLADIK	Well done.

RHONA	Where's Mika?

LILLIAN	How the hell should I know?

RHONA		Last chance, Lillian.

VLADIK	You took a round.

RHONA	More than you can say.

VLADIK	You should never take a round. I trained you better than that.

VLADIK	It's getting late.

KANE	Wakie, wakie, eggs and bakie!

KANE	Where are my guns, Richie? Where they at?

KANE	Hey, buddy. You don't think I'd forget about you, do you?

HANNIBAL	Richie. Stay with us.

KANE	You see, I know you had a meeting with Jack the Flower, right?

KANE	What did you talk to Jack about?

RICHIE	What are you talking about?

RICHIE	I never met with Jack, not even one time.

KANE	Is that right? Not once?

RICHIE	I'm telling the truth. I wouldn't lie to you, man.

KANE	Yeah, you wouldn't fucking lie to me.

RICHIE	I'm telling the truth. I wouldn't lie to you, man.

RICHIE	I might be crazy, but I'm not stupid.

KANE	Not at all. Not even a little fucking lie?

RICHIE	No! No.

KANE	Show him that.

KANE	Listen, Richie. You really think you can do something like that and get away with it?

RICHIE	I don't know when that

KANE	You really think...

KANE	you can pull off something like that and me not find out about it?

RICHIE	I don't know-I don't know when it was!

RICHIE	I don't know when that

KANE	You don't know what I'm talking about?

KANE	Not at all?

KANE	Give him one.

KANE	Oh, shit! Richie! Richie!

KANE	You know now, buddy? You know now?

RICHIE	Yeah, I do. I do.

KANE	You know what I'm talking about?

RICHIE	Yes, yes! I ran into him at a bar.

RICHIE	I just ran into him at a bar, that's it.

KANE	Is that right?

RICHIE	Yeah.

KANE	So you don't know about that.

RICHIE	I don't know anything. If I don't know anything, how could I tell him anything, right?

KANE	I got you. So, ignorance! That's your defense?

RICHIE	Yeah!

KANE	It was just happenstance, wasn't it?

RICHIE	Yeah! Just dumb luck!

KANE	Fucking dumb luck! Richie, it's really fucking dumb luck!

KANE	Like so fucking dumb! Oh, fuck, Richie!

KANE	Richie, I guess the only question, the fuck do I do with you?

RICHIE	I'll do anything for you, Kane. Anything you need.

KANE	'Cause I'm feeling fucking magnanimous.

RICHIE	Magnanamouse.

KANE	Generous, Richie! Fuck, keep up!

RICHIE	Okay. You'll let me go then?

KANE	Really generous.

KANE	Yeah. 

KANE	Yeah, Richie. I can do that, buddy.

KANE	I guess I just need you to do me one favor.

RICHIE	Anything. Anything, Kane. Anything.

KANE	Don't beg.

KANE	That shit's fucking disgusting.

RICHIE	Wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

RICHIE	No, no! What are you doing? What are you doing?

RHONA	Why are you here?

AMIN	Please, can you help us?

AMIN	Can you help us?

RHONA	Shit, shit, shit.

RHONA	Here. Have you seen this boy?

AMIN	Let me look.

RHONA	Yes, yes. What?

AMIN	Yes, I have.

RHONA	When? Where?

AMIN	Yesterday, in the office.

RHONA	Okay, okay, okay, okay.

RHONA	This'll do. Okay.

RHONA	Be quiet.

RHONA	Go. Go, go, go, go.

RHONA	Wait, wait, wait.

AMIN	No, no, no, we don't need

RHONA	Yes! Split it up and get out of here.

RHONA	There's a door there. You move, get out of here and you run!

AMIN	Thank you.

RHONA	Go! Go!

KANE	Apologies for the tardiness, but I did bring pie.

KANE	So tell me, how's our reimbursement program coming along? Good?

VLADIK	I'm working on it.

KANE	You're working on it?

KANE	Like...in the practical, or more like the abstract?

VLADIK	Reality.

KANE	Reality? Yeah, 'cause see, my reality is, I don't get my money by 7 AM…I'm planning a poor man's funeral. 

KANE	You know what a poor man's funeral is?

VLADIK	Yeah, I got my suspicions.

KANE	It's your funeral! 

KANE	I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean, still gonna have some bells and whistles for you.

KANE	You know, crying hookers, shit like that, but...

KANE	It's yours.

KANE	So, you know, word on the street is...you got Rhona making laundry runs for you. Is that right?

VLADIK	Couple of items needed cleaning up, yeah.

KANE	So, be honest with me. 

KANE	That why you took the kid?

VLADIK	Some people need more motivating than others.

KANE	Right. 

KANE	I don't imagine she's gonna be doing any laundry stops at my place. Am I right?

VLADIK	Not unless you spill your milk.

KANE	See, now you got me curious.

KANE	'Cause I usually never spill milk.

VLADIK	I'm sure.

KANE	Well...

KANE	I guess it's that time, right?

VLADIK	Bring him out.

KANE	Ricky.

VLADIK	Hey, take it easy on him.

KANE	What, you going soft on me? Come on.

KANE	It's like I said on the phone, just an insurance policy, nothing more.

VLADIK	Just a kid.

KANE	He's gonna be safe like he's in his momma's arms...sucking on that nice, perky tit.

KANE	Ain't that right?

KANE	Well...I appreciate the hospitality.

VLADIK	Anytime.

KANE	Anytime? Anytime?

KANE	I come here any time I want, right?

KANE	Holy shit! Don't forget, I paid for this shit!

KANE	Look at that.

KANE	Nothing. Just like I thought.

KANE	Seven AM.

JACQUE	Hello, Rhona.

JACQUE	This look actually suits you.

JACQUE	You interfere in my business. 

JACQUE	You free my product.

JACQUE	You affect my income.

JACQUE	I take exception to this.

JACQUE	It was you that hijacked Vladik's deal, wasn't it?

JACQUE	The gun deal, am I right?

JACQUE	It had to be. It couldn't be that imbecile Richie.

JACQUE	He can't even find his shoes when they're on his feet. It was you.

RHONA	Just give me the ledger and we'll all go home tonight.

JACQUE	Just give you the ledger? Sure, I'll just give you my ledger.

JACQUE	Andre, this woman is very funny, isn't she?

JACQUE	Yeah, I'll just give you the ledger.

JACQUE	You free my product, and you have the balls to make demands on me?

JACQUE	You are something.

JACQUE	I know exactly why you're here.

JACQUE	I know who sent you.

JACQUE	And you, you little Judas...you took that money, didn't you?

JACQUE	I find that to be very audacious.

RHONA	You own a toothbrush?

JACQUE	Games.

JACQUE	Games. Andre, they always have to play games, right?

JACQUE	You're risking your life, and you don't even understand the big picture.

JACQUE	Here.

JACQUE	Here's the ledger.

JACQUE	It's all here.

JACQUE	Let's not tempt fate.

JACQUE	Every deal I ever made is right in this ledger.

JACQUE	What can I say? Call me old school.

JACQUE	And what really fascinates me...is that he sent you to get this ledger...and you agreed without hesitation.

RHONA	And kill you.

JACQUE	To kill me.

JACQUE	Wow.

JACQUE	So, here's what I'm gonna do.

JACQUE	You cost me a lot of money when you freed my product...and you still look like you have a few good rides in you, right?

JACQUE	So, I'm gonna ply my boys up with Sildenafil...and I'm gonna give you to them so they can have their way with you...for as long as they want.

JACQUE	And when they bore of you in about a year...I'm gonna sell you at a very deep discount...to the Eastern European mongrels.

JACQUE	And maybe I'll get a little bit back of what I lost.

RHONA	Or we make a deal...and you avoid a slow death, painful death.

JACQUE	You got nothing I want or need.

RHONA	He'll send someone else.

RHONA	Or better yet...come himself.

JACQUE	Vladik.

JACQUE	Vladik and I, suffice to say...we've been doing this dance a long, long time, you know?

JACQUE	He's my personal Sisyphus. You know what Sisyphus is?

JACQUE	Do you? 

JACQUE	You know, up and down, up and down.

JACQUE	And of course he absolutely despises my skin trade business.

JACQUE	But the Rhode's scholar Richie explained to me...the only reason Vladik really wants to eliminate me and Kane...is so he can expand his own empire.

JACQUE	There's nothing new here. It's really cliché.

JACQUE	Yeah, long live the king, that BS.

JACQUE	So, my love...you get some rest.

JACQUE	You're gonna be wishing for it when my...when my boys get ahold of you.

JACQUE	Andre.

JACQUE	Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

JACQUE	Turn around. Yeah. Bend over. Bend over.

JACQUE	Good. Put your butt more to me.

JACQUE	Now look this way. That's good.

JACQUE	Yeah, arch your back now.

JACQUE	Arch your back. Come on.

JACQUE	Show me your tits. Put them over here.

JACQUE	Stick your boobs out. Take your arms and put them together.

JACQUE	Make them look bigger. Yeah, arch your back. Look right here.

JACQUE	Oh, that's nice. Oh, they're gonna love you in Serbia.

JACQUE	Yeah. Smile. Come on, look like you're having a great time.

JACQUE	That's nice. 

JACQUE	Yeah. 

JACQUE	Excellent. Okay, now look at me.

JACQUE	Keep arching your back.

JACQUE	Oh, that's good.

RHONA	What is it?

VLADIK	Open the glove box.

VLADIK	Had I wanted to kill you, you would've been dead already.

VLADIK	If you seek answers, open the glove box.

RHONA	Fine!

RHONA	More games?

VLADIK	Now the envelope.

RHONA	Mika's at your place?

VLADIK	Bring me my bag.

RHONA	Where's Mika?

VLADIK	Give me the case.

RHONA	Mika first.

VLADIK	He's not here.

RHONA	You said he was here.

VLADIK	No, I said, bring me my things.

RHONA	You lied.

VLADIK	And you stole.

RHONA	Where's my son? Where's Mika?

VLADIK	He's with Kane.

RHONA	What? Why?

VLADIK	Because I owe Kane a lot of money.

VLADIK	More than you stole.

VLADIK	He forced my hand. I had no choice but to manipulate you.

RHONA	So, you let him take our son?

VLADIK	Son I've never known.

RHONA	Because I didn't want him to be anywhere near this life.

RHONA	Because he is innocent, he's pure.

RHONA	He's the exact opposite of what we are. Don't you understand that?

RHONA	He's the one thing that you gave me that I'm actually grateful for.

RHONA	So yes, I saw the opportunity...and I took the money and your guns.

RHONA	Because I wanted him to be as far away from this place and

VLADIK	And me?

RHONA	Yes, and you.

RHONA	What we had was about us.

RHONA	Now it's about Mika.

VLADIK	I know.

RHONA	And that's the only thing that matters.

VLADIK	If I don't get that money to Kane by 7 o'clock...

VLADIK	our son is dead.

RHONA	Then help me get our son back.

RHONA	Vladik, for old times.

RHONA	Thank you.

VLADIK	Let's do this.

KANE	Shit! Look at that.

KANE	If it ain't the fucking king and queen of the prom back together again. Look at that.

KANE	Well, I guess I know what side you've chosen then, right?

VLADIK	Where's my son?

KANE 	Where's my fucking bag!

VLADIK	The kid first.

KANE	Get the kid.

RHONA	You son of a bitch. Get him out of the cage now!

KANE	Let him out.

KANE	I gotta thank you, Rhona...for taking care of my dirty laundry. I appreciate it.

KANE	Couldn't have done it myself.

KANE	And you! You got something for me?

VLADIK	Yeah. This is how it's gonna play out.

VLADIK	She'll go get the bag, you give us the kid.

KANE	Oh, that's how it's gonna play out?

KANE	You fucking hear him, Rhona? Move!

VLADIK	Go get the bag.

KANE	You know, I gotta... I gotta be honest with you.

KANE	Initially, I didn't see the resemblance at all.

KANE	Now... I mean, it's there, clean as day, right?

KANE	You squirted that out of your dick, didn't you?

KANE	I had no fucking idea.

KANE	Hell of a mom, though. Jesus.

KANE	Good score on that.

KANE	Lucky sperm call that kid, huh?

KANE	Is it gonna hurt your feelings if I tell you that I threw a leg over that? Would it?

KANE	Yeah, buddy. Just know...I planted my flag on the fucking moon...and you're a cosmonaut. That feel good?

VLADIK	So, how was the pie?

KANE	Oh, the pie.

KANE	Pie was fucking Entenmann's. Creamy, delicious.

KANE	Fucking Entenmann's.

VLADIK	Let's go.

KANE	That's far enough. Right there on the table.

KANE	Ricky! 

KANE	How are we doing, Ricky?

RICKY	We're good.

KANE	Right there.

KANE	Let the kid go.

KANE	Let's see what we got here.

KANE	The fuck is this?

KANE	Shit!

KANE	The kid!

MIKA	Dad!

KANE	Fuck!

KANE	Hey, kid.

KANE	Why don't you go see your mom, huh?

KANE	Attaboy.

RHONA	Baby, are you okay? Are you okay?

RHONA	Good.

KANE	It's only ever been about you and me, right?

VLADIK	Go on, get outta here.

VLADIK	Get outta here. Take care of him.

VLADIK	Go! 

KANE	So tell me, buddy... how you see this playing out, huh?

VLADIK	I don't know. What do you think?

KANE	I don't know. 

KANE	Maybe it's time for some of those crying hookers, though.

VLADIK	Maybe it's just a poor man's funeral.

RHONA	Come on. 

DAVID	The money's been deposited.

DAVID	Banco de Mexico, Calle Monte de Herales 602.

DAVID	Lomas de Chapultepec, Box 020232060832.

DAVID	Send me a postcard.

RHONA	David... thank you.

DAVID	Be safe.

RHONA	Like I said... in this business, there is no room for mistakes.

RHONA	Aside from a few bumps in the road, my plan worked perfectly.

RHONA	I kept the money, sold the guns... and I got my son back.

RHONA	Now, it's time to step on the gas... and start a new life.
