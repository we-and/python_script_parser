ZAC	Was it?  I love you.  Don't leave me.  Where are you going?  I'm ready for round two.  I'm a wild boar.	
DANNI	So wild.  What is this?	
GARY	Good morning.  You gotta be tired.	
ANDI	Why do you say that?	
GARY	Well, you got in late last night and you tossed and turned all night.	
ANDI	That's because I wanna talk to you.	
GARY	So serious.	
ANDI	Yes.	
GARY	Okay.	
ANDI	Sit down.	
GARY	No, I'll stand.	
ANDI	Gary, that's…	
GARY	Look, this is about me asking you about the money.  I'm sorry, I was just…	
ANDI	You've been saying that a lot lately.	
GARY	(scoffs) Because I am.	
ANDI	I've been thinking, and I think you should go make nice with her.	
GARY	Wait.  What are you--what are you saying right now?	
ANDI	If you go back home for a month…	
GARY	Andi.	
ANDI	Hear me out.  If you go back home for a month and make nice with her, she'll drop the divorce and I'm off the hook.	
GARY	Are you serious right now?	
ANDI	I don't see any other way.	
GARY	Okay.  So what happens after a month when I wanna come back here?	
ANDI	Well, if she comes back to the firm to--to file for divorce, then I'll tell her I can't represent her.  And then she'll have to go to another lawyer.	
GARY	Oh.  Okay.  So let me get this straight.  Um, I've been saying to you, begging you to be patient with me until I leave.  I leave, and now you want me to go back?	
ANDI	No, I don't want you to, I--look, I have been thinking about this all night and all day.  It's the only way.	
GARY	It's that guy.	
ANDI	Gary, it's…	
GARY	No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.  No, I'm--I'm not upset.  Uh, it's--it's all right.  I understand.  Hell, I was in a marriage, so, um, if you found someone else and you're with them, that'd be fair.	
ANDI	Baby…	
GARY	But it's that guy.	
ANDI	Baby--okay.  Don't be upset with me.  You know me.  You're the only one.	
GARY	Then don't make me go back.	
ANDI	You are asking me to risk everything I've worked hard for, and I won't.	
GARY	I'm not worth it?	
ANDI	Oh, don't do that.	
GARY	Tell your boss you won't do it and take another job.	
ANDI	I've done other jobs.  This is the best job in the city.	
GARY	Then I will help you go into private practice.	
ANDI	I don't want that.	
GARY	Why?  You too proud?	
ANDI	Gary.	
GARY	You feel like I'm going to have all the power.  Is that it?	
ANDI	Power?	
GARY	Yeah.  You feel like if I'm helping you, that makes you weak.  Am I reading this right?	
ANDI	You know what, I don't wanna start my day like this, so let's just talk about this another day.	
GARY	No, you just let me help you go into private practice and I will draw up the contract.	
ANDI	I am not ready for private practice, number one.  And number two, I don't want to.  And number three, your wife is gonna go to the bar and have me disbarred.  I won't be able to practice anywhere.  So no, I don't want your help with private practice.	
GARY	Then you stay home and we have a bunch of kids.	
ANDI	I am not a housewife.  I worked too hard to get here.	
GARY	So you think I'll divorce you?	
ANDI	Can you not make everything about you and make it about me for once?	
GARY	You really want me to go home?	
ANDI	I want you to do what's best in this situation.	
GARY	Do I have time to think about it?	
ANDI	You wanna think about it?	
GARY	Yes.	
ANDI	So you have no thought for me and what's best for me?	
GARY	Just the day.	
ANDI	Your wife wants you served by the end of the day, so no.  You don't have time to think about it.	
GARY	Okay.	
ANDI	What does that mean?	
GARY	I'll leave.  I'll leave.  I'll leave, I'll leave.	
ANDI	Okay.	
GARY	I'm so sorry about this.  You know I appreciate you so much.  And your strength, knowing who you are, knowing, you know, what you want.  It's just, this hurts like hell, but I get it.  I really do.  But wait for me.	
ANDI	What?	
GARY	Promise me you won't see anyone else while I'm doing this.	
ANDI	I'm not thinking about anyone.	
GARY	Promise me.  Promise me.	
ANDI	I promise you, I won't see anyone else.	
GARY	Okay.  I love you so much.	
ANDI	I love you, too.	
GARY	And I just wanna hold you for a little while longer.	
ANDI	No, no, no, no, no.	
GARY	Keep you here and make love to you.	
ANDI	No, I don't (indistinct)	
SINGER	Don't you think it's crazy that you're here?	
SABRINA	Hey, girl.	
KAREN	Hey.	
SABRINA	Sorry about last night.	
KAREN	Oh, it's fine.	
SABRINA	You sure?	
KAREN	Yeah.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Did you talk to Danni?	
KAREN	No, and I ain't gonna talk to her.	
SABRINA	You know that I really think we should…	
KAREN	Sabrina.	
SABRINA	I'm just saying.	
KAREN	Let her talk to Zac.	
SABRINA	Look, you know I'm just trying to help…	
KAREN	I just wanna get this workout in and get to work.  Please, that's it.  Okay?  What's up, Andi?	
ANDI	Hi, girl.	
SABRINA	Oh, you look tired.	
ANDI	Thanks a lot.	
SABRINA	Uh-huh.  Somebody's been keeping you up all night.	
ANDI	Oh, yes.	
SABRINA	Girl, I know the feeling.	
ANDI	Oh.  Is the red panty dropper keeping you up at night?	
SABRINA	Well, update, yellow panty dropper.	
KAREN	What?	
SABRINA	I know.  Don't look at me like that.  I know, I think he's on the down low.  What?  Excuse me?  Y'all better tell me.	
KAREN	Look, Andi thinks it's fine.	
SABRINA	Really?  Like, that he's on the down low?	
ANDI	No.  I just--I don't see anything wrong with the underwear.	
SABRINA	No?	
ANDI	No.	
KAREN	But what about the nails, though?  Because you--did you see…	
ANDI	Karen.	
KAREN	Okay.	
SABRINA	She's right.  I know.	
ANDI	I think they're too perfect.	
SABRINA	That's the same thing (indistinct)	
KAREN	And them eyebrows, too, girl, beat and beyond.	
SABRINA	I know.  I didn't notice that at first.	
KAREN	Are we looking at the same dude?	
SABRINA	Yes.  Yes.  And you know what?  I mentioned it last night when he came over, but he got so mad that he left.	
ANDI	Wait, you told him?	
SABRINA	Yeah.  We're about to, you know, do the do and I was…	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	And I saw his yellow panties.  And I was just so turned off.	
ANDI	And what did he say?	
SABRINA	That that's just the way he was raised, by his dads.  To be open.	
ANDI	Oh.	
SABRINA	So open he was a princess one year for Halloween.	
KAREN	Oh, you mean with a crown and a tiara, all that shit?  Sparkles and shit?	
SABRINA	I know, I know, girl.	
KAREN	Damn.  When you add all that up, it makes you wanna think twice	
SABRINA	Okay, but aren't--aren't we being a little bit close-minded considering the way that he was raised?  Like, what if--what if he was in a tribe somewhere in the middle of the rainforest?	
KAREN	…what you talking about?	
ANDI	Karen.	
KAREN	What? 	
ANDI	I feel you.  Because what if he was born some other place, we will be more open and understanding.	
KAREN	But this […] is from Decatur.	
SABRINA	He's actually from New York.	
KAREN	All the more reason to be suspect.  Them New York dudes is hard as hell, girl, you know that.	
SABRINA	But those are the ones you have to watch out for.	
KAREN	I don't know, girl, I think he's low, like, down low, sweet and low.	
ANDI	Look, Bre, neither of us are in a position to judge you.  So if you like it, we love it.	
KAREN	Speak for yourself.	
SABRINA	I'm not sure if like it.  I mean, I really, really like him.	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	You know?  But I don't like his choices.  And you know what I really don't like?	
KAREN	What's that?	
SABRINA	Are we this damn desperate that we have to date men with yellow panties?	
ANDI	Yes.	
KAREN	Yeah.  So be careful, though.  You gotta be, it's hard out here.	
ANDI	Yeah.  Get used to it.	
JAKE	Hello, everybody.	
KAREN	Speaking of gay, I will break all rules for his fine ass.  Look at that.	
ANDI	He is fine.	
JAKE	Are we ready?  Let's get this done, bitches.  Get them on up.  Let's do that (indistinct) ride it, come on, ride it.	
DANNI	Good morning, stud.

DANNI	I know, what do you wanna name the baby?	
ZAC	No.	
DANNI	No?	
ZAC	No.	
DANNI	We can't name the baby "No."  We can name her "Yes."	
ZAC	That's not funny.	
DANNI	You know, because	
ZAC	That's not funny.	
DANNI	Okay, you're right.  You're right.  You're right.  Because if we name her "Yes", all the guys are gonna think she's easy.

ZAC	Oh, I hate you.  I hate you so much right now.  Where's my underwear?  Where--where's my underwear?	
DANNI	Damn.  Now, that's soon.  I have no idea.  You threw them up.  I have to tell you, though.  No one has ever made love to me like that before.  I mean…	
ZAC	Oh, okay.	
DANNI	I see why you have them go crazy but I get why Karen is…	
ZAC	All right.

MAURICE	Why are you so frustrated?	
CALVIN	(panting) I don't get your girl, man.  She's crazy.	
MAURICE	Well, you're gonna have to stop wearing them underwear.	
CALVIN	(panting) I'm not changing who I am for her, all right?	
MAURICE	Those underwear are real cute.  Almost too cute for me to wear.	
CALVIN	(panting) I just don't like being judged like this.	
MAURICE	Calvin, listen.  Calvin, wait.	
CALVIN	(panting) What?	
MAURICE	Okay, stop it.  You can't--if you want me to talk to you, you better stop doing that.	
CALVIN	(panting) What?  I gotta keep this ass tight, all right?	
MAURICE	Calvin.	
CALVIN	What?	
MAURICE	That sounds very queer.	
CALVIN	Come on, bro.  Don't tell me you're gonna start judging me, too?	
MAURICE	No, no, no, you're just a rare bird.  A big bird.	
CALVIN	Would you stop that?  Just saying.	
MAURICE	Listen, Calvin, this is what you're going to have to do.	
CALVIN	Oh, shit, this'll be good.	
MAURICE	Take her somewhere and […] her brains out.	
CALVIN	She act like she don't want me to do that.	
MAURICE	What do you mean?	
CALVIN	It's like she wants me to do one thing but not the other.	
MAURICE	You have to show her that you are who you say you are.	
CALVIN	I'm not changing who I am.	
MAURICE	I ain't asking you to change.  I'm asking you to […] her.	
CALVIN	(panting) You are so stupid.  Come on, man.  It's your turn.	
MAURICE	Okay.	
CALVIN	Let's go.	
MAURICE	All right.  I want an ass like you.	
CALVIN	All right.	
MAURICE	All yours.	
CALVIN	These ain't too heavy for you, ain't they?	
MAURICE	Oh, no, it's just fine.	
CALVIN	Here you go.  Right.  You got it?	
MAURICE	Uh-hmm.	
CALVIN	Come on, straighten that back.  Okay.  Come on.	
MAURICE	Don't touch me right there.	
CALVIN	Come on.  Let's go.	
MAURICE	Okay.  Hold up.	
CALVIN	Down.  Up.  Come on.	
MAURICE	Uh-hmm.

SABRINA	That was so hard.	
ANDI	Yup.  Whose idea was this again?	
KAREN	This one breathing all heavy and shit.	
ANDI	(laughs)	
SABRINA	I got summer body going. 	
KAREN	Uh, Sabrina?	
SABRINA	What?	
KAREN	Look.	
SABRINA	I can't breathe.	
KAREN	Look, look, look.	
ANDI	Oh, my God.	
SABRINA	What the hell?

SABRINA	We just came out of spin class.	
CALVIN	Oh, you were?	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.	
CALVIN	I know the instructor.  He's a good friend of mine.	
KAREN	Oh, he's a friend of his.	
CALVIN	Yeah.	
KAREN	Oh.  Well.  I have to go to work.  I have to go.	
ANDI	Uh, me too.  I have to leave.  So we should go.	
KAREN	(indistinct) I'm gonna go.	
SABRINA	I'll see you.	
KAREN	Bye, guys.	
ANDI	No, no, you stay.	
KAREN	No, no, no, you stay.  You stay.	
ANDI	Girl, you're off today.	
SABRINA	Hi.	
CALVIN	Hey.  So am I really gonna see you again later?	
SABRINA	I mean, I'm just gonna be a little bit busy.	
MAURICE	No, you're not.	
SABRINA	Yeah, Maurice.  Don't you remember…	
MAURICE	Stop that lying.	
SABRINA	Maurice, don't you remember?  We have…	
MAURICE	Stop the lying.  Listen, she likes you but she thinks you are a little too feminine.	
SABRINA	Stop that.	
MAURICE	Look.  These weights too damn hard for me.  And I'm just gonna tell you.	
CALVIN	Yeah, we've already discussed it.  All right?  So why don't you just back off.  Please?	
SABRINA	Right.  Please.	
MAURICE	Oh, I need a wheelchair anyway, so I'm gonna go to the locker room to recover […]	
SABRINA	He's not right.	
CALVIN	No, he's right about what he said.  All I asked was if I was really gonna see you tonight.	
SABRINA	I mean, Calvin, I do wanna see you.  Do you--do you wanna come over tonight, so you can see me?	
CALVIN	Do you want me to?	
SABRINA	Calvin.	
CALVIN	Look, because I'm not with the bullshit, all right, Sabrina?  Either you're with it or you're not.	
SABRINA	With what?	
CALVIN	With me, the way I am.	
SABRINA	I mean, can we just have dinner and talk about it?	
CALVIN	Nah.	
SABRINA	Wait, what?	
CALVIN	Now, look, you got to go to work and I do, too.	
SABRINA	Calvin, you're really telling me you're not coming?	
CALVIN	I'll think about it.	
SABRINA	Really?  Okay.  Don't think about it too--don't think about it too long.	
KAREN	Girl, did you see him squatting?	
ANDI	I'm not in this.	
KAREN	I know, you saw it, though.  Did you see it?	
ANDI	Unlike you, I'm actually going to work.  Excuse me.	
KAREN	Okay.  Bye.	
ANDI	Nope.	
SABRINA	Karen.	
KAREN	Yes.	
SABRINA	So, what do you think?	
KAREN	Baby, if it quacks like a duck…	
SABRINA	Really?  Come on.	
KAREN	You gonna see him?	
SABRINA	(sighs) I just need to ask him.	
KAREN	But you already did that.	
SABRINA	I know.	
KAREN	Okay.  So, there is nothing left to ask.  You better just make a choice.	
SABRINA	Why is this so hard?	
KAREN	Because you like him.	
SABRINA	Yes, I do.	
KAREN	Tell you what, why don't you ask the instructor?	
SABRINA	Jake?	
KAREN	Yeah.  You know he's gonna have tea.	
SABRINA	You think?	
KAREN	Yes.  Go ahead and ask him.	
SABRINA	He'll get mad if he finds out.	
KAREN	So what?  Just…	
SABRINA	No, I couldn't.  I couldn't.	
KAREN	Girl, you need a stop, just do what you got to do.	
SABRINA	No.  I'm good.  I'm good.	
KAREN	Okay.  Well, then, you just don't wanna know the truth I guess all that is.	
SABRINA	Well, will you do me a favor then?	
KAREN	Yeah, I'll ask him.  It's not a big…	
SABRINA	No, no, no.  Uh-uh.  Not about that.	
KAREN	What?	
SABRINA	Will you talk to Danni?	
KAREN	Oh, hell no.  I'm not talking to her.  I already told you that.	
SABRINA	Come on.	
KAREN	How did we get off your boyfriend and onto Danni?  Can you tell me that?	
SABRINA	Well, he's now my boyfriend.	
KAREN	Whatever he is.	
SABRINA	I'm just thinking you need to talk to Danni.	
KAREN	You know what, I'm just thinking that I need to take a shower.  I'm gonna do that.  Yup.	
SABRINA	Karen.	
KAREN	Bye.	
SABRINA	Karen?	
KAREN	Bye.	
SABRINA	Karen?	
KAREN	No.	
GARY	One more bag.  You sure about this?	
ANDI	I don't see any other way.	
GARY	I'll put everything else in the car if you're sure.	
ANDI	(sighs) I'm not sure about anything, to be honest.	
GARY	Not even how you feel about me?	
ANDI	I know how I feel about you.  I love you.  But it's just the only way I can see us clearing this situation.  It's by doing this.	
GARY	Okay.	
ANDI	Okay.	
GARY	When will I see you?	
ANDI	(chuckles) Work on that and focus on her or else she'll know.  She's smart.	
GARY	Damn.  I can't believe you're making me go back there.	
ANDI	I don't wanna make you do anything.  I just--I want you to make the right choice.	
GARY	So, I'm not supposed to talk to you for a month?	
ANDI	Babe, we both need time to figure this out.	
GARY	Are you sure it's not someone else?	
ANDI	No.	
GARY	If you are, just tell me.  Just let me know.	
ANDI	Okay.  Why do you always think that I'm seeing someone or that someone is waiting in the wings?	
GARY	How could that not be?  I mean, you are an incredible woman.  I'm not sure if I can do my life all over again…once I met you, that would be it.  Game over.	
ANDI	Yeah, well, we are in reality.	
GARY	I know.  I really know.	
SINGER	Your ways (indistinct)	
ANDI	I love you.	
GARY	I love you, too.	
SINGER	But still you came back to take more.  Watch me only with that (indistinct) I've cried these tears a thousand times.  And my heart aches every time I hear your name, you came right in and sweep my heart from underneath.  And my heart aches every time I see your face, keep what's yours but please bring back the rest of me (indistinct)of my life.  You ruined everything inside.	
JAKE	Great job today, girl.	
SABRINA	Thank you.	
JAKE	You coming tomorrow?	
SABRINA	Oh, yes.	
JAKE	Good.  Getting ready for the summer.	
SABRINA	Yeah, founded by you.	
JAKE	Okay.	
SABRINA	Can I ask you something?	
JAKE	Yeah.  Anything.	
SABRINA	How do you know Calvin?	
JAKE	Oh, from here.	
SABRINA	Oh.	
JAKE	You like him?	
SABRINA	Just, you know…	
JAKE	I can introduce you, but I think he's seeing someone.	
SABRINA	Oh, who?	
JAKE	I mean, I don't know who, but some guy who works on his houses, they seem really close.	
SABRINA	Oh, so he is gay?	
JAKE	Uh, yeah.	
SABRINA	Okay.	
JAKE	Try somebody who is not on my team.  Have you met Hines?	
SABRINA	No.	
JAKE	Yeah.  He's the massage therapist.  He's single.  And he's straight.	
SABRINA	I don't know.	
JAKE	Hines.	
HINES	What's up, Jake?	
JAKE	This is Sabrina.  She is a great girl.  You should know each other.  Give her your card.	
HINES	Hi, how are you doing?	
SABRINA	Hi.  Hi.	
HINES	Uh, so, you need a massage?	
SABRINA	Yeah.  Who--who doesn't?	
HINES	(chuckles) Okay.  Well, lucky for you, the first hour is free for my new-time clients.	
SABRINA	Oh, really?	
HINES	Uh-hmm.  Like, here, take my card.  And just give me a call.  I actually got to run, um, but it's a pleasure meeting you.	
SABRINA	Me, too.	
HINES	Thanks, Jake.	
JAKE	You got it.  Told you.  You better work it, girl.  Hmm.  You got to work it.	
FATIMA	Ms. Barnes.  Um, do you make appointments?	
ANDI	What are you talking about?	
FATIMA	That Aaron guy is here again with no appointment.	
ANDI	Oh, damn.	
FATIMA	I mean, I can send him away.	
ANDI	No, no.  Um…	
FATIMA	Well, I don't know how else he's gonna learn unless you do.	
ANDI	(chuckles) You're right, but I will see him.	
FATIMA	Okay.	
ANDI	Oh, and this is the card for the private detective that Ms. Borders hired.	
FATIMA	Yes.	
ANDI	Could you call him and set up a meeting?	
FATIMA	Okay.  And she's called several times today.	
ANDI	What is she saying?	
FATIMA	She just keeps asking where her husband Gary will be served.	
ANDI	Okay.  Tell her that I'm in court and that'll call her by the end of the day.	
FATIMA	Okay.	
ANDI	All right.  Um, send him back.	
FATIMA	Yes.  Um, can I tell you something?	
ANDI	Yeah.	
FATIMA	I really admire you.	
ANDI	What do you mean?	
FATIMA	I mean, look at you, you're the only black woman here and you're killing it.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
FATIMA	I got your back.	
ANDI	(chuckles) Well, thank you.  Girl, he is here again unannounced.	
KAREN	Who?	
ANDI	Aaron.	
KAREN	Girl, I'm done with that.	
ANDI	Yeah, right.	
KAREN	I'm gonna call you when I'm done.  Bye.	
AARON	Thank you.	
FATIMA	You're welcome.	
ANDI	Hmm.  Come on in.	
AARON	Thank you.	
ANDI	Have a seat.  What can I do for you?	
AARON	Well, uh, I mean, go ahead and give me grief for not calling.	
ANDI	What's going on?	
AARON	Uh, is the divorce filed?	
ANDI	Yeah, as of this morning.	
AARON	So I'm divorced?	
ANDI	You're divorced.  If that's all you needed, you could've asked my clerk.	
AARON	True.	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
AARON	You got me.  I did want to talk to you.	
ANDI	I figured.	
AARON	Um, first, I wanna apologize for my behavior last time I was here.  I was a little bit out of line.	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
AARON	Um, but I also wanna talk about Karen.	
ANDI	What about her?	
AARON	Well, she's a nice person, um, but she's a bit of a wild one, so to speak.	
ANDI	And what does that mean?	
AARON	Well, I like her, but she can be abrasive.	
ANDI	Well, why don't you talk to her?	
AARON	I want to.	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
AARON	But I feel like she needs a good friend to kind of make her aware of what she does.	
ANDI	And what is it that she does?	
AARON	Breaks people down with her words.	
ANDI	So, you want me to talk to her for you?	
AARON	No, no, not for me, for her.	
ANDI	That is awfully thoughtful of you.  And I'll do that, but I think you should too.  How about we both talk to her?	
AARON	You think I should?	
ANDI	Yeah, why leave it to me?  Help a sister out.	
AARON	Okay.  Yeah.  I think I will.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
AARON	No, thank you.  And thank you for helping with the divorce.	
ANDI	Oh, you did most of the work.  How is your wife--ex-wife handling it?	
AARON	Honestly, not good.	
ANDI	Hmm.	
AARON	But I guess that's not really my concern.  Uh, I can only control me, right?	
ANDI	Yeah, you're right.	
AARON	Yeah.  Thanks again.	
ANDI	Of course.  Make an appointment next time.	
AARON	(chuckles) I'll--I'll work on that.	
ANDI	Yeah.  (chuckles)	
AARON	Have a good day.  Take care.	
ANDI	Um, yeah.  He wanted me to talk to you.	
KAREN	(through phone) About what?	
ANDI	The same thing.	
KAREN	What?  How I talk to Zac?	
ANDI	Karen.	
KAREN	Am I--look, babe, can you just go down there?  They'll take care of you.  You look good.  Am I that bad?	
ANDI	No, you're not bad.	
KAREN	Y'all make me like I'm the bad one.	
ANDI	(through phone) Don't get upset.	
KAREN	And why would he talk to you about it?	
ANDI	I don't know.  (scoffs)	
KAREN	(through phone) Look, I gotta go.	
ANDI	Wait, are you upset?	
KAREN	I'm about to do a perm.	
ANDI	(through phone) Girl, there ain't nobody in your chair.	
KAREN	I'm about to do a perm so I'ma call you back, okay?  Bye.	
ANDI	She's upset.	
ZAC	Where's my underwear, Danni?	
DANNI	I don't know.  Do you need a ride to work?	
ZAC	How am I gonna go to work naked?	
DANNI	You sure or do…	
ZAC	I'm positive.	
DANNI	Okay.  'Cause that bike-riding down the highway is gonna look real dumb.	
ZAC	Especially if I'm naked.  Where's my underwear?	
DANNI	You know what?  Uh, honestly…	
SABRINA	Hello.  You weren't gonna let me in?	
DANNI	You know what […] I'm taking my key back.  What are you doing here?  I'm on my way to work.	
SABRINA	Girl, you know I know your schedule.  Why are you acting like you're mad at me?  What the hell is going on?	
ZAC	Nothing.	
SABRINA	Where are his clothes, Danni?	
ZAC	I've been asking her that.	
DANNI	He's about to put them on.  He doesn't wanna be late for work.  Come on, baby.	
ZAC	I know this looks bad…	
SABRINA	'Cause it is bad.	
DANNI	No, actually, it was good.  We had sex last night.	
ZAC	Oh, come on, Danni.  Danni, where's my underwear?	
DANNI	Boy, they're over there in the top drawer.	
ZAC	The one with your sex toys in it?	
DANNI	Just move them around.  Tsk.	
ZAC	Everybody's gonna hate me.	
SABRINA	Pretty much.	
ZAC	Excuse me.	
DANNI	I had seen it all already.  What do you want?	
SABRINA	Guess I should've came last night.	
DANNI	He did.  Eh-oh.	
SABRINA	Will you stop it?	
DANNI	No, it was fun.	
SABRINA	Danni, did you sleep with him for real?	
DANNI	Oh, well, you know, you said you know me.  You know, y'all know me so well, right?	
SABRINA	You know you're gonna regret this when you make up with Karen.	
DANNI	To hell with her.	
SABRINA	I hoped you wouldn't have done it.	
DANNI	Well, I can't wait to send her the sex tape.	
SABRINA	What sex tape, Danni?	
DANNI	Oh, the sex tape we made.	
SABRINA	No, you're not.  You're not doing that.	
DANNI	Oh, I'm going to send it.	
SABRINA	Do not do that.  Erase it.	
DANNI	No, I need this fantasy, you know, to relive it and relive it.	
SABRINA	You know this is not right.	
DANNI	You wanna see it?	
SABRINA	No.	
DANNI	Yeah, you do.	
SABRINA	No, I do not.  I just came to check on you because I'm on my way to work.	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	And I clearly see that you're okay.  So I'm just gonna go.	
DANNI	Are you disappointed?	
SABRINA	Very.	
DANNI	Well, now you know what I am, right?  What do you think of me now?	
SABRINA	Danni, that's really not fair.	
DANNI	Oh, yeah, it is.  It really is.	
SABRINA	Hmm, wait a second.  Are you--are you really mad?  Are you mad at me?	
DANNI	Sabrina, I'm not mad at anyone.  No.	
SABRINA	Oh.  Oh, yes, you are.  You really wanna do this?	
DANNI	It's done.	
SABRINA	Okay.	
DANNI	Bye.	
SABRINA	This is wrong.  This is really wrong, Danni.	
DANNI	Bitch.	
FATIMA	Andrea?  There is a Paris Johnson here to see you.	
ANDI	Where is he?	
FATIMA	In the lobby.  Shall I send him in?	
ANDI	Yes, please.	
FATIMA	Okay.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
FATIMA	You're welcome.  This way, Mr. Johnson.	
PARIS	Hi.	
ANDI	Hi.  	
PARIS	I just came to bring you these.	
ANDI	Have a seat.  You bake?	
PARIS	Well, my grandmother does.  They're from her.	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.	
PARIS	And she insisted that I brought them to you right now.	
ANDI	(chuckles) That sounds like her.  The little I know about her.	
PARIS	She's a very stubborn woman.	
ANDI	That I can tell.	
PARIS	My grandma was very lucky that you were here.	
ANDI	Yeah.  How is she?	
PARIS	She's good.  She's home, bitching that I won't let her go to work.	
ANDI	I am happy it's you fighting that fight and not me.	
PARIS	And I'm also supposed to ask you to out.	
ANDI	I can't.	
PARIS	I get it.  That was her idea.	
ANDI	So you didn't wanna ask me out?	
PARIS	Well, no.  I just figured you wouldn't date a guy like me.	
ANDI	Like you?	
PARIS	Yeah.  Construction.  You look like the type that would date the owner of the company instead of the employee.	
ANDI	Don't sell yourself short.	
PARIS	Well, how can I not when you just shut me down?	
ANDI	(chuckles) Don't do me like that.  I'm in a relationship.	
PARIS	I get it.	
ANDI	And why are you not in a relationship?	
PARIS	You already asked me that.	
ANDI	Well, maybe I don't believe your answer.	
PARIS	Well, why does it matter?  Listen, enjoy the cookies and I'll see you around.	
ANDI	Okay.	
PARIS	And thank you again.	
ANDI	Of course.  Irene, Irene.	
FATIMA	Ms. Barns.	
ANDI	What now?	
FATIMA	Leslie Davenport.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
FATIMA	Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	Have a seat.  I'm Andrea Barns.	
LESLIE	Leslie.	
ANDI	Thanks for meeting me.	
LESLIE	Sure.	
ANDI	I have to admit, I thought you were a guy.	
LESLIE	I get that a lot.	
ANDI	So, you represent Ms. Borders?	
LESLIE	Yes.	
ANDI	Have you found anything interesting on her husband?	
LESLIE	Yes.  Very.	
ANDI	Okay.  What is it?	
LESLIE	I think we have a lot to talk about.	
SABRINA	Next on Sistas.	
LESLIE	I'm scheduled to meet with Ms. Borders this evening and you got about 24 hours to figure out what you wanna do.	
KAREN	I have a customer.	
AARON	Not for the next hour or so because I booked you.	
KAREN	I think this is stalking.	
MAURICE	You are to know it's 'cause of your man that I'm walking this way.	
SABRINA	Okay, Maurice.  I'm eating.	
ZAC	I've been sick all day about last night.  I said a lot of things.  I don't know why I said them.  This whole thing is making me crazy.	
FATIMA	Hi, my name is Fatima and I work for Andrea.	
KAREN	Is she okay?	
FATIMA	No.  I could get in a lot of trouble for this.	
KAREN	Is she--is she all right?
