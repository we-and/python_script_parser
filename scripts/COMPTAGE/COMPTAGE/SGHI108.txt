MARS	(Spanish)
 
JULIUS KEMPER	Very often beautiful art is created in very ugly times, and we're entering a very ugly period.

PAPO	You gonna try to deport Lo Musulamno, Lo Mexicano. What, you gonna deport the homeless too? You gonna try to deport me you better have room for my cart on that boat back to the Dominican Republic. I ain't going that easy.

DR. JAMISSON	Oh him? Oh I would love to have several huge sessions with the President. They're gonna be amazing. And I'll even do it for free.

PAPO	Here's my salute you.
 
SHEM/RACH/NO/CLO	Liberty and justice for all.
 
PAPO	Now I ain't going down like no punk. Huhuh. He ain't my President. The bomb, baby. Yeah!

NOLA	Bonjour Greer.

GREER	Bonjour, Mademoiselle Nola.

NOLA	Come on Talley-Ho’.

GREER	What does that mean?

NOLA	It means I need to work on my French. What's up Greer?

GREER	Hey, why did you leave the other night?

NOLA	I mean, you had all your Becky with the Good Hairs there, I decided to dip.

GREER	I know. You’re right. Don't be Mad at me.

NOLA	I’m not Mad at you, Greer.

GREER	Prove it. Let me come over?
 
NOLA	Bonjours, Monsieur Greer. Yo, you look like Boo Boo Da Fool right now. What do you have on?

GREER	Baby, Boo Boo will be your Fool All Day Everyday, 'cause of that smile right there.

NOLA	Nola Darling stays Smiling.

GREER	Oh, Nola Darling speaks in Third Person now?

NOLA	Yeah. It’s called The Racqueletta Effect.

GREER	The Rackalaka-What? Like my Grandma Damita Jo used to say, You sound like you on that Stuff!

NOLA	I’m High but it’s not Kush related. I’m High off the fact that I just Sold one of my Painting for a very nice Piece of Change.

GREER	Stop. Sweet baby! Let’s do Lunch.

NOLA	Nah, I appreciate it, but I’m in work mode. What up with those Jimmy Huggers though?

GREER	Yo! I like that. Um, message to moi... put Jimmy Huggers on the list. Copy That. Okay wait wait wait, when we were at dinner, did you say you wanted me to take a risk? Baby, this is what a risk looks like.
 
NOLA	Okay.

GREER	These were all the rage in Europe in the 70s. My Dad Designed these when he was an Expat in Paris. They are a Political and a fashion Statement declaring that Black Men had not be restricted in any Way, Shape, or Form. Hense, the Free Johnson Slack. Free Johnsons Slack, that sounded cool. Um, message to moi, put Free Johnsons on top that list, copy that. You laugh now, but when these bad boys hit the runway next Fashion Week, I’m gonna be the one laughing all the way to The Bank, baby.


NOLA	Free Johnson Slacks?! Actually that's kind of catchy. I’m not Mad at that one.

GREER	So for real, why did you leave last week?

NOLA	I was visiting a sick friend at the hospital.

GREER	Wow. Is he okay?

NOLA	She ... is. She’s getting better every day.

GREER	See that’s what I love about you, that right there. How you care about people. So anyway, what’s up with lunch?

NOLA	I told you, I’m in grid mode. Besides, I’m not going anywhere with you dressed like that.

GREER	So, who says we have to eat out? Who says we have to be dressed? Yes...Nola!

NOLA	Overstreet!

GREER	Overstreet? What was that?

NOLA	What?

GREER	You said “Overstreet.” What does that mean?

NOLA	It means you are going 120 in a 55 Mile Per Hour Zone. Yeah... You're, you're speeding Greer, It’s Overstreet... Slow Down.

GREER	I’m just so glad you’re in such a good mood. If selling one of your painting makes you like this, I hope you sell the fuck out.

NOLA	Thank you. It just feels good to finally have some Paper, you know. I can pay my Bills, buy some new art supplies, some Canvases, Paint Brushes. Maybe even a Sexy new Dress.

GREER	Yes to The Dress!

NOLA	This has been great but you really do need to bounce.

GREER	I get you got plans with one of them other motherfuckers?
 
NOLA	Do you want me to be mad at you?

GREER	I'll catch you later.

NOLA	Okay.

GREER	Okay.

CHERYL	Are you Fucking this Woman? This Darling? I’m assuming that’s her name. She looks kinda young.

JAMIE	She's Twenty-Seven (27).

CHERYL	Are you Fucking 27 year-old Miss Nola Darling?

JAMIE	You never asked me that before.

CHERYL	I’m assuming that’s a Yes.

JAMIE	Don't assume, it makes an ass out of you and me and I don’t like Trick questions.

CHERYL	Are you Fucking This Young Bum Bitch?! What’s so Fucking Funny?

JAMIE	Whatever, Cheryl.
 
CHERYL	Nola Darling. What kind of name is that? What is she doing with a Fourty year - old man? I hope you know you’re not the only one Fucking this Child. I know a Man is going to be a Man. Especially a Man who grew up in Brownsville.

JAMIE	Fuck does that mean?

CHERYL	It means I fell for a Climber.

JAMIE	Yeah but you put the Ladder out there.

CHERYL	I did. You climbed up my Back to the Penthouse. I made you who you are. I gave you Cache. And I gave you a Son.

JAMIE	No, I gave you a Son. I gave you excitement. Yeah, this New Jack from Brownsville Gave Upscale Jill a Brand New Thrill.

CHERYL	Why are we even still married?

JAMIE	Do you really got to ask that Question?

CHERYL	Did you tell Nola she’s your soulmate? Like your other Soul Mate from Two Years ago? Or the one before that? How many Soul Mates do we get in this one Life we have? And why can’t I have one?

JAMIE	Spontaneity is everything.

NOLA	I know. So good. Okay.

ARLENE	And is it gonna be Cash or charge?

NOLA	Charge, please.

ARLENE	Sure. It's not going through. Yeah.
 
NOLA	Really? Could you try it again?

ARLENE	Sure. Still declined.

NOLA	That's so weird. I just made a large deposit to this debit account yesterday.

ARLENE	Do you have another card?

NOLA	Not one with any money on it.

ARLENE	We have an ATM.

NOLA	Yeah, an ATM is not going to help me today.

ARLENE	Nola, how about you call your bank.

NOLA	Word. Hey Miss Ella.

MISS ELLA	No “Hey Miss Ella” nothing. Sit over there on my stoop.

NOLA	I know, I know, I know I know I know. The Check. Look, I can explain this time …
 
MISS ELLA	Nola, I don’t like Checks that Bounce. Being  a landlord is a Business and you Messin’ with my Business. Please understand, the minute you leave here I could get four times as much rent from these White Folks as what I'm charging you now. Excuse my language, but Nola, you got to get your shit together! You’re a grown ass woman. Now you got two  days. You can hire a moving van, or all your shit will be right out here on the street.


NOLA	Yo, what kind of Fucking Game is this, Jamie?! Why would you put a Stop on That Check?!


JAMIE	Babe, I did not put a Stop on that Check.

NOLA	Do you understand that, that Check was not a Loan, but a Payment for my Work? That Check you wrote to Me was for My Rent, My Utilities, My Food, My Sustenance, and most importantly, My Art! My Art, Jamie! And again... My Rent! Insufficient Funds?! Are you Fucking kidding me?! How am I supposed to pay my Rent? Look, I was barely making it as it is, and you know I'm not fucking moving back in with my parents. I might have to move out of Brooklyn now, maybe even move out of New York! Is that what you want, Mister Jamie Overstreet? Mr.Provider?! Mr. “Nola-I- Got- You?!” I’m so tired of people like you letting me down.

JAMIE	Letting you down?

NOLA	What is this? Am I your Pay- for-Play Call Girl?! Did your Wife have something to do with this?
 
JAMIE	This was on me, alright. I will fix it. Why would you say something like that?


NOLA	Well hear this, Mister Jamie Overstreet... I want my fucking painting back, today! Okay?

A.	S. A. To the motherfucking P.

C.K	I'm glad to have you all on the Fort Greene, historic Fort Greene Brooklyn tour. Now we over here near Cumberland Hospital where Albert King was born, Bernard King was born, Mike Tyson and the GOAT, you hear me the GOAT, Michael Jordan, M.J Forty-five Twenty-three (45 – 23), you know, the GOAT. And over here, we got Nola darling, one of Brooklyn's finest street artist. You know what I'm saying, come check her stuff out.

NOLA	Thanks C.K.

C.K	Sell it!

NOLA	Anybody want to buy some Art? I got that exotic Native Brooklyn shit you can bring back Home.

C.K	True, true.

NOLA	So these prints are two for Fifty (50), or you can buy all of them for Two-Hundred (200).

C.K	Chill yo.
 
NOLA	Hum, no picture of the art, please.

C.K	Support the culture. You not copping? No? We gonna go over there to Fort Greene Projects, I'ma show you where Dana Dane was born.

PAPO	What up, C.K?

NOLA	Everybody...? Okay, thank you.

PAPO	Coming through, coming through.

C.K	Papo, my man!

PAPO	Coming through, coming through. I see you Nola! And I Ain’t Mad At you. How's it going, making some money?

NOLA	Not today, apparently.

PAPO	Not today, huh? Maybe you could use that little radio. It ain't got no speakers, but it's good, you know. I took the speakers out.

NOLA	What year is this from?

PAPO	That? That's like a transistor, transmitter, lie detector, Nineteen-Thirties (1930's) around that, took the speakers out of there too, you know, 'cause I'm working on that new piece.

NOLA	Word?

PAPO	Yeah, nothing but speakers. I'm gonna call it “No one's listening.”
 
NOLA	Hey, Ms. Moss. Can you actually give me a minute today, please?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Raqueletta Moss knows how you feel, Miss Darling. Raqueletta Moss knows that it could be that time, or maybe the Mattress Rodeo put a little bit too much Yee! in your Ha! last night... Or Miss Darling has a case of Hustle- itis. When you are doing way too much to make ends meet.

NOLA	That one.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	I understands, And I offer this free advice ... Miss Darling, you got to Work The Hustle, never let the huslte wok you. Adjust it to your personal temperature. You’ll be ok. You are a Winner, Nola.

NOLA	Thank you. Ah, I needed that today.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	No crying at work!

NOLA	No crying at work.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	So what did y'all do today?

NOLA	Everything.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Everything but no titties and beach ball booty, right?
 
NOLA	Not today. I don’t know. When this week started, I was like Mad Happy and now I am just Mad mad.

MARS	Well let me tell you something that'll cheer you up. Your My Name Isn’t racked up almost Fifty-Thousand (50,000) hits on the 'Gram.

NOLA	Instagram ain't paying my damn Rent.

MARS	Well it can.

NOLA	Yeah, If I’m ass’d out for some bullshit endorsement. The point is, I may have to move or like leave Brooklyn altogether. Tired of rocking Ten Hustles just to survive.

MARS	What’s going on?

NOLA	Some Money I was depending on from one of my Painting I sold, the Check was stopped. It’s just straight Murphy’s Law, everything that could go Wrong has gone Wrong.

MARS	Yeah it don’t help that that Clown-Ass Onyx is trying to deface Your Art. Yeah but you know what the good thing is? That several of the Murals show people crossing out Onyx’s name and Bigging up the Original Artist... you. And they don’t even know it’s you. That's lit.

NOLA	Pretty lit.
 
MARS	You know that's lit.

NOLA	Well that Fool’s Day will come.

MARS	You should really consider Lourdes and the Yoruba Cleansing.

NOLA	You really think that could help me?

MARS	You remember what she said about the Spider?

NOLA	Is that a tat on Onyx's hand?

MARS	Hell yeah, that's a tat.

NOLA	Shit.

MARS	Si.

NOLA	But Lourdes ain't doing those Cleansings for Free, Right?

MARS	Lourdes knows how I Feel about you. She'll let it slide for something as important as this. Trust.

NOLA	You sure know how to Warm a girl's Heart.

MARS	I wish I could Warm a little something else.

NOLA	Do you?
 
MARS	Mmhh. Can I warm it?

NOLA	Maybe.

MARS	Can I warm it?

NOLA	Maybe.

MARS	But can I warm it?

NOLA	Maybe.

MARS	Can I smell it?

NOLA	What? Yeah, and I wouldn’t ask you Guys if I didn't really need it.

SEPTIMA	Ladybug, I wish we could help, but we just paid the Mortgage, the Con- Ed, taxes. So we're just trapped.

STOKELY	I know how hard it is for you to ask for Help. That’s a Gift, Nola. Not a Loan.

NOLA	Well I appreciate your generosity but this a Loan and I am going to pay you back.

STOKELY	Okay Baby Girl. A Loan.
 
NOLA	I forgot to tell you, I am getting a Cleansing today.

STOKELY	I thought you needed that Money to help pay your Rent. But you’re going to get a Spa treatment now?

NOLA	It's not that kind of Cleansing, daddy. It's a Yoruba Cleansing.

STOKELY	That’s not a good look, Nola.

SEPTIMA	You need to stop with that Foolishness, Stokely. Like you’re some Paragon of Virtue now? Need I remind you how many years you paid Tithes to the Coke boys in the Marcy Projects?

STOKELY	You’re right. I have been a Hypocrite. But I Love my Daughter, and I know that a Cleansing is not a good move for her. It was a Santeria Priest who said he was going to put a curse on me more than 30 years ago, when I was at Medgar Evers College. This Dude dressed in all White jumped in front of me in the line. I tapped my Man on the shoulder and asked him what was up? Said this is a line and, you know you just can’t jump in front of me. Dude in the Triple White gear looked at me as if I was Crazy and asked me if I knew who He was. I said yeah, you the Dude who jumped in front of me in the line, and dog, you need to get to the Back of The Line. And the dude in Triple White said to me, said he was going to put a Curse on me. For some reason, out of nowhere, I recited that passage from Psalm 146. And then, I left the Hallway. I never saw that, that Guy again after that.

NOLA	That's your experience, Dad, and you couldn’t change my mind even if you wanted to.

STOKELY	Baby Girl. Don’t I know that.
 
NOLA	Can you dead that Baby-Girl thing Dad, Please.

SEPTIMA	I Love You Stokes, but you are really full of Shit sometimes.

LOURDES	These are tribal marking of a Goddess. You're a Queen, Nola. May the blessings of Oshun be with you. Put the clothes that I tore off of you along with an item that you may still have that ties you to the vision that you told me about. Take that bag, and leave it at the gates of the Greenwoood Cemetery, along with nine pennies to pay the spirit of the night. And Nola, this is very important, when you drop that bag, you never look back. Never look back.

WINNY	Who that?

JAMIE	It’s me fam, Jamie.

WINNY	Sit down Jamie.

JAMIE	Well if it ain’t Nino Brownsville. I’m sick of being your Keeper, Winny.

WINNY	What's that supposed to mean, Jamie?

JAMIE	It means that living in the Past is gonna kill your Ass. It means you were a One-Hit Wonder who never got over it.

WINNY	Oh I forgot, man. It's the fucking Brooklyn Heights Gatsby or some shit. What the fuck happened to Jay Gatz from Brownsville, B?

JAMIE	I paid for all of that. Looks like I'm still paying, this place is still a Cash Cow for you.
 
WINNY	Excuse me? You paid for this shit? I'm the motherfucking Mathematician who solved your 99 problems. Maybe you forgot. Eight fucking years in the bing, Jamie, C-74.

JAMIE	Hey, come on man, listen I appreciate what you did for me fam, but let's keep it real alright? You sat for a something you put me on to do, because you said I was a Juvy, but we both know that was a Long Time Ago in a Bleek Galaxy far, far away.

WINNY	What the fuck do you want, Jamie? My Silent Partner?

JAMIE	I need Ten Stacks. Right now. And then I want out. I mean that Shemekka Shit. You are Sloppy as Fuck with your Business, bro.

WINNY	Yo Jamie B, that fucking Shemekka shit, that's the least of your fucking worries! And you know what the fuck I'm talking about Little Cuz! You got more to lose than me.

JAMIE	You sure about that? All your situations from back in the day. All your Young Guns from Brownsville and for certain situations, There Is No Statute Of Limitations.

WINNY	That' what the fuck I said, Jamie. If I fall, you fucking fall too. Ain’t nobody talking about shit around here, around here Jamie. You know something?

JAMIE	Listen man, I just...

WINNY	You a Motherfucking Young boy. You ain’t the Real Soda. Matter of fact, when you was little you was talking like a fucking little White Boy. I escorted you to the game, Jamie. You ain’t got no fucking flavor. You a fucking Seltzer Water trying to get a fucking Fizz, Jamie.
 
JAMIE	I need those Ten Stacks... Please.

WINNY	That’s more fucking like it, Jamie. Fucking got some shit with you, coming around here with that shit. You know better than to bring that bullshit right here to the Hot-N-Trot, man. Fuck out of here. Fuck you, Jamie.
