NOLA	Peace and Blessings, My Parents decided to spend the Holiday with my Father’s Parents. I couldn’t go because my Boss Miss Raqueletta wouldn’t give me yesterday off, so here I am in Da Republic of Brooklyn, (N.Y.). To Me, Thanksgiving is a Time for appreciating Family, Love and Life. I give Thanks to The Most High for a Great Mom and Dad who definitely let me DO ME and BE ME. They have supported me from the Git-Go being an Artist, to let me express who I am and who I hope to be through my Art. The way I see Me as opposed to how others see Me. However, to Me Thanksgiving is also a Grim Reminder of This Country’s Genocide of Our Native Peoples, the Forced Occupation Slash Takeover Slash Total Bogarting of their LAND. Much like the Gentrifiers who have BUM- RUSHED HOODS All Over This God’s Planet. In any case, Happy Thanksgiving and may you be sharing today amongst your Beloved Friends and Family. (Ashé)!!! Thank You Mars. That’s sweet of you- Cheese Cake from Juniors.

MARS	Speaking of POTUS, Nola, did I ever tell you about the Time I told Barack Obama to run for Office to be The First Black President Of The United States of America?

NOLA	No Mars.

MARS	I thought I did. I wuz’ walkin’ down Fulton Street, by Junior’s and this young Guy comes up to me askin’ me for directions. I looks in his Eyes and it Hit me like a Bolt of Lightnin’ right then and there. I told Barry, that’s what he went by then. I said, Barry My Man, My Brother, you will be The One, The 44th President of these Estados Unidos.

JAMIE	You knew the Year Too?

MARS	I have a Gift.

GREER	Am I alone in feeling it’s Blasphemous to tell Lies at The Thanksgiving Table.

MARS	Who you callin’ a Liar?

GREER	You, sir.

JAMIE	Gentlemen. Gentlemen. It’s Thanksgiving.

MARS	And y’know da messed up part is? As soon as Hussein, that’s Barry’s Middle Name, won his First Term I took Da Dollar Bus to D.C., Went up to the White House to see my Brother and Da Service Secret wouldn’t let me see Barry. Why he play Me like that? Coldblooded. Know what I mean? But he still my man.

JAMIE	I didn’t have that problem. I contributed a Pretty Penny to both of his Presidential Campaigns and had the Honor and Privilege to have Golfed with The Commander in Chief in Martha’s Vineyard on the Farm Neck Golf Course more than once.

NOLA	Let’s try not to be Profane.

MARS	My Bad. My Bad.

GREER	Why did you invite me to this Turkey Fiasco?

NOLA	What do you mean? It’s Thanksgiving.

GREER	I know that.

NOLA	Should I pack a Doggy Bag for you?

MARS	I taste The Vanilla, You know what I mean?

NOLA	Yup, My Mom’s Secret Ingredient. She made The Pies.

MARS	Ya Moms Threw Down.

JAMIE	Nola, what is the purpose of inviting all Three of us?

GREER	What is this all about?

MARS	Da Element in Da Room.

GREER	Elephant.

MARS	First thing we all agreed on All Night.

NOLA	I would like you to know the only reason I’m doin’ this is ‘cuz you Men think you know me. You think you know what I’m about and what not. The Truth is you don’t know. I Mess up like we all do but I never punish myself when I make mistakes. What’s the Point? ‘Cuz Da World is too ready to punish you anyway. And if in the End it helps some other people out that’s a Good Thing too. I consider myself “Abnormal” Who wants to be like everybody else. Not Me. Y’all have called me a “Freak.” I Hate that Word. I don’t believe in it or better yet I don’t believe in One word labels. The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams. That’s a MeShell Ndegeocello Joint.

JAMIE	I, we all appreciate your candor but I don’t now if you answered the questions.

GREER	Why are we all here?

MARS	Word.

NOLA	All of you are here ‘cuz while I never lied about seeing other People. I still felt wrong too. All of you asked me all the time “Who are the other Dudes?” Well now you know. You are that “other Dude.” That answers everybody’s questions?
 
JAMIE	Sort of.

NOLA	What don’t you understand?

GREER	We understand...

MARS	...We just don’t like it.

NOLA	Well, that’s for you to deal with.

GREER	What kind of Lady...

NOLA	...Acts like a Man?

JAMIE	Tasty.

GREER	Sweet.

MARS	I taste The Vanilla, You know what I mean?  (to Greer) Can you pass me the leche?  (to Jamie) Azucar (ad lib)

NOLA	Thank you.

GREER	Cherie, Mon Amour, What are you doing? Your hands are far too gentile for dishwater.

NOLA	No Thanks.

GREER	Avez, S’l Te Plait.

NOLA	Go! Relax.

MARS	I love washin’ Dishes. My first job was as was a Dishwasher.

NOLA	No. Mars, Rule #68. No Guests wash dishes.

MARS	Nola, you got too, too many Rules. Good Luck.

NOLA	I’m surprised you were able to make it.

JAMIE	My Family, we always have an Early Thanksgiving Dinner.

NOLA	What did you say to get away?

JAMIE	During Dessert Cheryl and I got into it and she told me to leave the House. To be honest, I wasn’t planning on being here when I got the invite.

NOLA	Sorry.

JAMIE	I’m here.

NOLA	Yes, you are.

JAMIE	If I’d known there would be other Guest invited... I don’t know.

NOLA	“It’s Complicated.”

JAMIE	I won’t speak on behalf of Greer and Mars but this is highly uncomfortable.

NOLA	And sometimes being uncomfortable can be a good thing, like it forces you to React, Move, Evolve.

JAMIE	Is that what we’re doing?

NOLA	You tell me.

JAMIE	Why do you always answer and Question with a Question?

NOLA	What?

JAMIE	You ain’t right.

NOLA	Whatever.

JAMIE	You still ain’t right. Seriously Tho’, I got a Real Estate Agent looking for an Apartment for you. Your Life, Your Work and Me.

NOLA	Thank you for the kind offer but I can NO DO. I’m a Strong, Independent Black Woman and God Willing I will get to where I need to be fending for myself. Putting in The Work that needs to be done so I can be Financially stable... Come Hell or High Water.

JAMIE	Everybody needs Help.

NOLA	True, and being Blessed with The Catlett Prize is a Big Help.

JAMIE	I’m very Happy for you.

NOLA	Thanks but Who’s to say Cheryl won’t cancel another Check. Jamie, I never want to go through the embarrassment ever again. You Feel Me? Do you?

JAMIE	You Right. You Right. I Feelya. I Feelya and I don’t feel Good ‘bout it also.

NOLA	Come on. We’re being rude to the other guests.

GREER	You said you’re Black and Puerto Rican.

MARS	Afro-Boricua. Black and Puerto Rican.

MARS	Yo My Man, I grew up in BK, New York. There is a a long, long History of Black and Puerto Ricans livin’ in Da same Hoods, Hookin’ Up, Intermarryin’ and Whatnot. No Issues at all. My Sister Lourdes and I are a direct example of that, Carmelo Anthony too. Melo’s from Red Hook, Brooklyn. Da Hook.

RASPBERRY BERET	1,2,
	1,2,3
	Yeah
	I Was Working Part Time
	In a Five And Dime
	My Boss Was Mr. McGee
	He Told Me Several Times
	He Didn’t Like My Kind
	 ‘Cause I Was A Bit Too Leisurely
	Seems That I was Busy Doing
	Something Close To Nothing
	But Different Than The Day Before
	That’s When I Saw Her,
	Ooh, I Saw Her
	She Walked in Through
	The Out Door, Out Door
	She Wore A Raspberry Beret
	That Kind You Find
	In A Second Hand Store
	Raspberry Beret
	And If It Was Warm
	She Wouldn’t Wear Much More
	Raspberry Beret
	I Think I Love Her
	Built Like She Was
	She Had The Nerve To Ask Me
	If I Planned To Do Her Any Harm
	So, Look Here
	I Put Her On The Back Of My Bike
	And We Were Riding
	Down By Old Man Johnson’s Farm
	I Said Now, Overcast Days
	Never Turned Me On
	But Something About The Clouds
	And Her Mixed
	She Wasn’t Too Bright
	But I Could Tell When She Kissed Me
	She Knew How To Get Her Kicks
	She Wore A Raspberry Beret
	The Kind You Find
	In A Second Hand Store
	And If It Was Warm
	She Would Wear Much More
	Raspberry Beret I Think I Love Her
	The Rain Sounds So Cool
	When It Hits The Barn Roof
	And The Horses Wonder
	Who You Are Thunder Downs Out
	What the Lightening Sees
	You Feel Like A Movie Star
	Listen
	They Say the First Time
	Ain’t the Greatest
	But I Tell Ya
	If I Had The Chance
	To Do It All Again
	I Wouldn’t Change A Stoke
	 ‘Cause Baby
	I’m The Most
	With A Girl As Fine As She Was Then
	Raspberry Beret
	The Kind You Find
	 (The Kind You Find)
	The Kind You Find
	 (In A Second Hand Store)
	Oh No No
 	(Raspberry Beret)
	 (And If It Was Warm)
	Where Have All
	The Raspberry Women Gone?
	Yeah (Raspberry Beret)
	I Think, I Think I,
	I Think I Love Her
	 (Raspberry Beret)
	No No No
	No, No, No
	 (The Kind You Find)
	 (In A Second Hand Store)
	 (Raspbetty Beret)
	Tell Me
	Where Have All The
	Raspberry Women Gone?
	 (And If It Was Warm She)
	(Wouldn’t Wear Much More)

ITIS CRAWL	For All of You uninformed Folks. The Definition of Da “ITIS” according To The Urban Dictionary is “The General Feeling of Lethargy (SLEEP) and Well-Being experienced after Eating (Devouring) a Satisfying Meal (THANKSGIVING). This Phenomenon is particularly triggered by Carbohydrates and Meats containing the Amino Acid Tryptophan. Da “ITIS” is a Common African-American Tendency.

NOLA	What A Thanksgiving Night. As you observe I have a “Rashamon Effect” on Da Treacherous Three. My Lovers Jamie, Greer and Mars. They all view me differently but they all want to Possess Me. I will not allow them to Paint me into a Box, To Paint My Life as They see fit. I got to deal with Myself, who I am now and in this Moment in Time and Space. I have to look within Me to understand and FEEL what makes me Happy. If Jamie Overstreet Greer Childs and Mars “Crazy Mutherfucker” Blackmon want to Deal with ME it will, it has to be on my own Terms or it Won’t, It ain’t gonna happen. Can’t Be 1 Hunnit. 10 x 10. That’s why I painted that 3 HEADED MONSTER. That Artwork is about being Open, Shiny and not Shadowy, ‘bout Da Truth and I understand many times that is the Hardest thing to Get To, to Land at a Place where Folks can find Sincerity, Candor and Frankness, amongst Each Other. I feel I demonstrate that first and foremost in my Art. Whatever Y’all Folks think about my Truths... that’s on you. Oh shit, I almost forgot I gotta give a LOVE SHOUT OUT To My Soul Sistuhs Reggie, Raqueletta Moss, Clorinds, Shemekka, Skylar, and her Moms, Opal. Love You Black. Hello, Who IS It?

OPAL	Nola, it’s me.

NOLA 	What are you doing here?

OPAL	Skylar’s father’s in town and she’s spending Thanksgiving with him. I brought a bottle of Champagne. I thought we could share it.

(FINE)
