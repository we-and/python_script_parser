THOMAS	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER	Rajiv had just arrived back from the Great Railway Show. He couldn't wait to show everyone his trophy.

STORYTELLER	'Hi everyone! I'm back!' 

STORYTELLER	But there was no one there.

STORYTELLER	Rajiv looked around the goods yard.

STORYTELLER	Then he looked in the sheds. 'Where has everybody gone?!' <sigh>

STORYTELLER	'I really wanted to show off my trophy...'

STORYTELLER	Then Rajiv saw one of the Railway Workers coming towards him. 'I've just got back...' began Rajiv. But the Railway Worker was in too much of a hurry to listen.

STORYTELLER	'You're needed at the City Centre Station, right away!'. And then he ran away... 

STORYTELLER	'How strange...' said Rajiv, who was beginning to feel a bit sad.

STORYTELLER	So Rajiv puffed to the City Centre Station. 'No one is interested in seeing my Trophy. I was the best decorated engine in the whole of the Great Railway Show... And now they probably just want me to collect some coal.'

STORYTELLER	But when Rajiv was near the City Centre Station he found a man waiting for him.

STORYTELLER	'Are you Rajiv?' 'Yes,' 'The same Rajiv that won the best decorated engine competition at the Great Railway Show?' 'That's me,' 

STORYTELLER	'Then take me to the Station right away please!' Rajiv was very puzzled.

STORYTELLER	Rajiv took the man to the City Centre... But before he got there, he discovered...

STORYTELLER	A huge crowd waiting for him.

STORYTELLER	'Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... The champion engine from the Great Railway Show... The best decorated engine in the world - Rajiiiv!!!!'

STORYTELLER	Everyone started to cheer.

STORYTELLER	Rajiv was very happy!

STORYTELLER	It was the proudest Rajiv had ever been... 

STORYTELLER	'Maybe I'll go back next year and try to win again’

THOMAS	I hope all my friends are having fun journeys, and I hope I see them again soon.
