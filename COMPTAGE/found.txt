(Spotting-List – Lost and Found)




Mr. Thorndyke	Emma! The guests are here. Everyone has been asking about you. Come on, this charity event was your idea, remember?

Emma	Go away! I never want to see another man for as long as I live!

Mr. Thorndyke	What did Hank do now?

Jenny	Hank was last month, Mr. Thorndyke. She’s upset about Evan Richmond.

Mr. Thorndyke	Do I know Evan Richmond?

Jenny	It’s the young man Emma's been seeing for the last three weeks.

Emma	We just broke up over Twitter!

Mr. Thorndyke	What? Why? You’re for it and he’s against it?

Emma	Dad, you are so clueless!

Jenny	I think she means on Twitter. You know, through text messages.

Mr. Thorndyke	What kind of relationship is that?

Emma	One that doesn’t exist anymore!

Mr. Thorndyke	Look, well, sweetie, come on. Whoever this...Evan guy is, he’s an idiot. We all love you. Please, join us. Do whatever you have to do to make her come downstairs. She has got to make an appearance, alright?

Jenny	I’ll try, Mr. Thorndyke.

Mr. Thorndyke	And goats is not enough.

Jenny	Your father’s gone. Can I come in, please?

Mr. Thorndyke	Hey, Stan, you made it. Samantha, thanks for bringing him. This is a good cause. You know, I mean, a healthy body leads to a healthy life. That's what they tell me. And look, genuine yoga goats. I mean, who can resist them?
	Hey folks! The demonstration is about to get under way. But I also wanted to remind you, we're raising funds tonight for the upcoming marathon. "Running With Goats." Yeah, really! I kid you not!

Emma	Jen, why do guys stink?

Jenny	Because most of them don't shower enough?

Emma	How could he say that I’m shallow and not independent?

Jenny	Babe, you're twenty-seven and you're still living in your father's house.

Emma	You’re taking his side?

Jenny	No, I never really liked...Evan or Hank or...

Emma	Gary.

Jenny	Gary, for that matter.

Emma	So you’re saying I've got bad taste in men. Great.

Jenny	You just, you choose style over substance.

Emma	It's my mother's fault.

Jenny	Emma, she's passed away thirteen years ago now.

Emma	Yeah, and if she hadn’t, she could've given me advice on men. I mean, it’s a minefield out there! And every guy I seem to meet is like a grenade. You pull their pins out and they explode!

Jenny	That sums up the opposite sex quite accurately.

Emma	I'm done. I'm going to run away and join the convent.

Jenny	Okay, but before you do, can you go downstairs and greet the guests? Remember, PR means public relations. That only works if you can relate to the public.

Emma	Public? A bunch of overweight blimps pretending to support physical education when their belts can't even support their bellies? No thanks!

Jenny	There are some also very in shape, hot personal trainers and athletes, and some really adorable baby goats. And thanks to you, I’m going to be hoovering up goat hair for, I don't know, days. Maybe weeks.

Emma	Evan was right. My life is pointless.

Jenny	He’s wrong. I may be your dad's PA, but I’m also your best friend.

Emma	Yeah. And what does that say about me?

Jenny	It says you need to stop feeling sorry for yourself, go downstairs, or I'm going to slap you. In your face, and it’s going to hurt.

Emma	Fine. I mean, fine, I'm going to go in five minutes!

Jenny	Okay.

Emma	Just give me a second so I can make myself flawless again.

Mr. Thorndyke	And here she is. Your co-host for this evening, and the love of my life. My daughter, Emma. Now let's get this party really started.

Emma	Five minutes, Dad. What? Come on, these are some wonderful people. I mean, this young man here, I met him at the athletic club. You haven't even seen the goats. You look great. Enjoy yourself!

Nick Milano	Of course. I’ve been to Wimbledon numerous times I just finished up a tournament in Dallas. Won. “40-Love”

Emma	Are you a tennis player?

Nick Milano	That is my racket.

Emma	I’m Emma Thorndyke.

Nick Milano	Oh. Your father invited me here. To give tips on how to stay in shape.

Emma	Oh please, tell me more.

Nick Milano	I’d be happy to.

Jenny	Here we go again.

Emma	So, are you Italian?

Nick Milano	Si.

Emma	Oh, I do.

Nick Milano	My name is Nick Milano. Please, call me Nick. I just finished a tour of the U.S.

Emma	Did you win?

Nick Milano	I rarely lose. But for me, it is not about the outcome. It is the playing of the game that matters. Therein lies the fun, the challenge.

Emma	Oh, I like games.

Nick Milano	I could tell that the moment I saw you. I said to myself, “Now, here’s a woman who could teach me a thing or two.”

Emma	Oh, well. I know very little about tennis.

Nick Milano	Oh, it’s not too difficult. First, there’s your stance. The way a player stands before hitting the ball. You have a closed stance, neutral stance, semi-open stance.

Emma	Okay.

Nick Milano	And open.

Emma	Open works for me.

Nick Milano	Next, your grip is very important.

Emma	Oh.

Nick Milano	There are many techniques here.

Emma	Okay.

Nick Milano	Western Grip, Eastern Grip, Continental grip.

Emma	Let's go for Continental.

Nick Milano	Next, you need to hit the ball on the sweet spot. That’s the center of the racket.

Emma	Oh.

Nick Milano	I always aim for the sweet spot. Then, there’s the stroke when you hit the ball.

Emma	Hard?

Nick Milano	Always hard. It is what makes me a particularly good server.

Emma	Well, if you’re the server, then what does that make me?

Nick Milano	The receiver, of course.

Emma	And how long does that go on for?

Nick Milano	Until love set.

Emma	Oh, I like the sound of that.

Nick Milano	But unfortunately, I have to leave tomorrow back to Rome. The life of a professional sportsman. What do you do, Emma?

Emma	Oh, I keep busy too. Helping my father. Organizing events like this one.

Nick Milano	That’s wonderful.

Emma	No, you're wonderful. Coming here for such a good cause.

Nick Milano	Perhaps...One day you and I can play a round together.

Emma	Oh, I’d love to play around with you, Nick.

Nick Milano	Until then...Game, set, match.

Emma	I’m telling you, Jenny. This is the real thing. Nick is the one.

Jenny	You've just met him.

Emma	Yeah. Haven’t you ever heard of love at first sight?

Jenny	Yeah, with "your check’s in the mail” and “I’ll still respect you in the morning.”

Emma	You’re wrong. You didn't see the way he looked at me. It was a real connection. And he said he's love to see me again. I’m going to surprise him. And show all my stupid exes and my father that I can be my own independent woman. Come on, Jenny. Please, I need your support on this one!

Jenny	Okay, what are you going to tell your father?

Emma	Oh, nothing. I do not want him to know where I am, or what I’m doing. Nick and I are going to be completely self-sufficient.

Jenny	On your father’s credit card.

Emma	No, Jenny. I have my own credit cards.

Jenny	That he gets the statements to. Monthly.

Emma	Right. I'll just bring cash. Ten grand should be enough for a week or so, right?

Jenny	And you...you don’t believe in banks?

Emma	Oh, there’s plenty more in the bank. This is just my mad money.

Jenny	Mad is right. You can't go around with that much cash on you. There are muggers everywhere.

Emma	Good call.

Jenny	Emma, just take one credit card in case of emergencies.

Emma	Okay.

Jenny	I really hope you know what you’re doing.

Emma	I have never been so certain about anything in my life.

Jenny	That’s actually a scary thought. Your dad’s really going to miss you, you know.

Emma	I’ll contact him once Nick and I are happily married. My dad might be rich, Jenny, but he’s lonely. Having all the money in the world without anyone to share it with is just not for me. I need love in my life. I need Nick.

Jenny	I just hope Nick needs you too.

Emma	You know, I think he does. Okay, I can do this. It’s the first day of my new life in one of the most romantic places in the world. I don't mean this place. I mean out there. In Rome. Excuse me, do you speak English?

Man 1	No, but I understand English.

Emma	My luggage is missing, it never got off the plane, and all my things are in it. Can you please help me?

Man 1	Oh, you have to go to the lost and found. The lost and found, over there.
	Lost and found.

Emma	What?

Man 1	Lost and Found, you must go to Lost and Found.

Emma	Ah.

Russell	Just a minute. I’m almost done.

Emma	I want to speak to your supervisor!

Russell	No, you don’t. He’s a jerk.

Emma	I’ll be the judge of that. Where is he?

Russell	I’m the supervisor. What seems to be the problem?

Emma	I’ve been waiting here for over forty minutes.

Russell	I’ve been working here for over four years but you don’t see me complaining.

Emma	My luggage is missing!

Russell	Oh, really? When's the last time you saw it?

Emma	Oh, I don't know, maybe when it was loaded onto your stupid, overcrowded plane that served stale pretzels!

Russell	I hate it when that happens. What's the name?

Emma	Emma Thorndyke.

Russell	Sounds painful.

Emma	Look, you lost my luggage, and I demand you to find it. That is your job, is it not?

Russell	Only on the week days.

Alex	Hello! Hi, Russell. Hello, Miss. Can I be of service?

Emma	I hope so.

Russell	This is Alex, our best employee here. Well, our only employee. This is a small airport.

Emma	Big enough to lose my luggage.

Alex	Can you describe the missing luggage?

Emma	Yes, so it’s a large pink suitcase with flowers and cats all over it.

Russell	Real ones? Customs might have an issue with that.

Emma	Pictures. And don’t judge me. My mother gave me that suitcase when I was twelve. It has great sentimental value.

Alex	I understand. You are American, no?

Emma	I live in California. Flight 232 from LAX. 232...

Alex	Got it. We will locate your suitcase in a day or two.

Emma	Wait, are you kidding? What am I supposed to do until then? All of my clothes and personal belongings are in that bag!

Russell	The airline is very sorry for the inconvenience this is causing you, so we'd like to offer you this.

Emma	What is it?

Russell	Well, this is a little travel package. We have a comb here, a little toothbrush with some toothpaste for those pearly whites. Little thing you know, if you want your beauty sleep, and this wonderful unisex T-shirt!

Emma	No no, that’s it. I want to speak to your superior.

Alex	Everyone’s superior to Russell. Don’t mind him. I will find your suitcase. I promise.

Emma	Fine. But all my money is in that suitcase. The ticket cost me 942 dollars, the bag fee was 50 dollars, I bought some water in the terminal, so I'm broke. I’ve got three dollars to my name, which is Emma, by the way.

Alex	Oh, Alessandro. Alex. Pleased to meet you.

Emma	I'm not! Well, I would be under different circumstances...

Alex	Understood. Do you have credit cards?

Emma	Oh, just the one, but I can only use it in case of an emergency.

Alex	You know, some people might think this situation is an emergency.

Emma	Not me, because you’re going to fix it. You promised.

Alex	Do you have any family members?

Emma	No. No family. It’s just me now. I’m relying on you. My life is in your hands.

Alex	So, let me think one second...Idea! Maybe I know someone who can help you. Temporarily.

Emma	Great! Well then, let’s go. I hate airports.

Russell	This is why I’m not nice to customers. Just saying.

Alex	Shut up, give me the key! The Colosseum. So, first time in Rome?

Emma	Yeah. Do you know a guy called Nick Milano? He’s a famous tennis player.

Alex	I can’t say I do because I don’t. Is he a friend?

Emma	Well, soon to be boyfriend, then my fiancé, and then my husband. I’ve got it all worked out.

Alex	Sounds like it. Does he live nearby?

Emma	Oh, I hope so. I’m here to find him.

Alex	Why don’t you call him?

Emma	Oh, well, I want to surprise him. He doesn’t know I’m here in town. And I don’t actually have his number or know where he is, but that’s okay. As soon as I find my bearings, I’ll begin my mission. Tracking down Nick Milano. So, where do you live, Alex?

Alex	In a small place in town. Very small, but my parents have a nice farm near La Fattorietta. They grow tomatoes and...

Emma	Oh, Roma tomatoes. I eat those.

Alex	No no, Roma tomatoes are actually grown more in the United States, Mexico, and Australia. We have a different kind of tomato, very special.

Emma	Where are we going?

Alex	I have a friend who owns a cafe. There’s a room upstairs.

Emma	Hold up. I’m not shacking with some random Italian guy that I don’t know.
	Unless his name is Nick Milano.

Alex	Don’t worry. My friend is not Italian or a guy. Thanks, honey. So Emma, this is my friend, Diana Jensen. And Diana, this is Emma...

Emma	Thorndyke.

Alex	Yes, exactly. From California.

Diana	Right, it's the young lady that lost her luggage.

Emma	Oh no, I didn’t lose it. They did.

Diana	Oh yeah, I...You know, the same thing actually happened to me ten years ago.

Emma	And you’re still here waiting for it?

Diana	No, they found it. They found it. I just stayed for other reasons and I opened this cafe. So, Alex here tells me that you’re strapped for cash.

Emma	Oh, well, only until they find my suitcase.

Diana	Well, I actually have a spare bedroom above the cafe. You know, food and rent are not for free, So, are you willing to do a little bit of work?

Emma	Work? You mean as in like, work?

Diana	Oh yeah, just the standard definition of work.

Emma	What kind of work?

Diana	You want to guess?

Emma	Oh, this is like a coffee shop, right?

Diana	Yep. Coffee shop. So...cleaning and let's see...serving customers. You are going to get the hand of it. You are.

Emma	Yeah. I mean, I’m an independent woman. So I can do it. Find my suitcase fast!

Alex	Yes, I will let you know as soon as we have located it. I’ve got to go now.
	Thanks for the coffee.

Diana	You're welcome.

Alex	Bye. Emma.

Emma	Oh.

Alex	Good luck.

Diana	Well, why don't I show you to the room and get you all set up.

Emma	All my clothes are in my missing suitcase.

Diana	I figured as much. I think I got you covered. Come on.

Emma	Right.

Mr. Thorndyke	Gone? What do you mean, gone? Where did she go?

Jenny	I don’t know, Mr. Thorndyke. She just said she needed to get away for a while. She wants to become a little bit more self-sufficient.

Mr. Thorndyke	I’m all for that. But to leave without saying goodbye? What the heck? Does she hate me that much?

Jenny	No, Emma loves you. I know she does. She just needs to find herself. I’m sure she's fine. And she’s a lot more resourceful than you think. And I bet, wherever she is, she’s got everything under control.

Emma	I can’t go out like this. I look like a street urchin!

Diana	You look like a girl that works in my cafe which is exactly what you are. So, what part of California did you say you were from?

Emma	I live in L.A.

Diana	Well, why don't you try to get some rest. I will see you downstairs bright and early in the morning. 7 a.m. sharp.

Emma	7...?

Diana	Now pay attention. Now first, there is caffè. Caffè literally does translate to coffee. A caffè is also a shot of espresso. It's served in a tiny, hot cup and customers drink them all day long. Caffè corretto, which is a shot of espresso corrected with a shot of liquor. The most common additions are grappa, sambuca, or Cognac. Cappuccino, which is probably Italy’s most famous coffee. Caffè latte, well, it's basically an American latte. One third espresso, two thirds heated milk, and a little bit of foam. Marrocchino is a shot of espresso, layer of foam, and a sprinkle of cocoa powder in a glass mug that's also been dusted with cocoa powder. Macchiato. Shakerato. Caffè al Giseng. Caffè d'orzo.

Russell	It’s her again.

Alex	How do you know that?

Russell	Because the phone is ringing.

Alex	Hello? Emma! Your suitcase did get on a plane, but it was the wrong plane. We’re thinking Japan. Yes. Once I get confirmation it’s there, I’ll immediately get it on the next plane out to Rome. I promise. Hello? Emma? Hello? Bad connection.

Russell	Sure. I told you not to get involved.

Alex	Russell, this is our job. We are responsible.

Russell	You like her, don’t you?

Alex	You're crazy, I just feel sorry for her. She has no family, she's alone. No money.

Russell	Sounds like your type.

Alex	You know nothing about my type. And she told me she’s in love with another guy.

Russell	Sounds like exactly your type.

Alex	Stupid. You're stupid. And you know that.

Diana	Relax. You're going to do just fine. Okay, look, there's a customer.

Emma	How can I help you?

Customer 1	Shakerato, please. One.

Emma	Does that mean small?

Diana	No, she just wants a cup of iced coffee. Remember, this is not Starbucks.

Emma	Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.

Diana	It's okay. Sorry, she’s new. She’s American.

Customer 1	I see.

Diana	Small.

Customer 2	But this coffee is disgusting!

Diana	What just happened. What did you make him?

Emma	He ordered a caffè corretto, so I made an espresso with a shot of...
	Cognac, sambucca, grappa, and some Irish cream, just like you said.

Diana	Okay, Emma, that was “or,” not “and.”

Emma	Oh. Yeah. Look,

Diana	so my customers they come in here for just a little pick me up, not to become alcoholics.

Emma	Yeah, I’m sorry, Ms. Jensen. But you know, I’ve never had to serve anybody before.

Diana	Yeah, what exactly did you do for money back in America?

Emma	Oh I just got it. And spent it.

Diana	What? Do you have like a sugar daddy or something?

Emma	I had a daddy, but he wasn’t always so sweet.

Diana	Oh. You poor girl... Look, why don't you go in the back and just sweep. Can you do that?

Emma	Yeah, yeah.

Diana	Okay.

Emma	Now?

Diana	Yeah.

Emma	Okay.

Diana	Yeah.

Jenny	Finally! I was starting to get concerned. And... your father’s already worried.

Emma	I know, he’s been calling and leaving messages but I haven’t responded.

Jenny	Okay, but are you okay? And how's Rome?

Emma	I'm surviving. But they've got me working in a coffee shop.

Jenny	What?

Emma	It's a long story.

Jenny	Okay. So can you tell me everything?

Emma	Well, you know what, I actually feel like Cinderella but during the bad part of her story, you know? And like, they make her clean and like...work and stuff. Like, that's me! Honestly. No, I'm not lying! I'm cleaning right now!

Jenny	You'll be okay.

Diana	You know you owe me big time for this favor.

Alex	It’s not working out?

Diana	Look, she’s really sweet, but doesn’t have a clue. Like, I put her in the back, so she could just clean up. Or not.

Alex	I’m really sorry, Diana. But I didn’t know where else to take her. I just felt bad for her.

Diana	I know, honey. Listen, I do too. I think she's actually escaping an abusive relationship back in the States.

Alex	No.

Diana	Yeah. So, I mean, obviously I want to help her but I want to keep my business open too. Come on, she's gotta know somebody else here?

Alex	Yeah, she told me she was looking for a guy.

Diana	Okay.

Alex	Named... Oh God, Nick something... Nick Milano!

Diana	Milano?

Alex	Yes.

Diana	Milano. Why does that sound so familiar?

Alex	He’s a tennis player.

Diana	Yes, I think. I never heard about him.

Alex	But she said she has a plan to marry him. But she might be a little, you know, delusional. You sure do know how to pick them.

Emma	Those glasses were piled up way too high. They almost killed me. You found it, my suitcase.

Alex	Yes, Russell located it in Japan and it was shipped right out.

Emma	Great, will it be here tomorrow?

Alex	Not quite. It’s just making a little detour to Iceland first.

Emma	Iceland?

Alex	Yes. There was a slight communication problem. Italy. Iceland. It’s understandable.

Diana	It happens.

Emma	I’ve gotta get out of here.

Diana	Yes. That is a great idea. Actually, look, I'm about to close up, So, why don’t the two of you go get a little dinner? And I'll go reorganize what you just reorganized.

Emma	Well, as long as you don’t need me anymore, Ms. Jensen.

Diana	I don’t need you. So go, have fun.

Emma	Where should we go?

Diana	Out.

Alex	I know a place.

Emma	Great!

Alex	Bye.

Diana	Bye.
	

Waitress	Coffee?

Emma	No, thank you. I do not want to see another coffee for as long as I live.

Alex	Only the check, please.

Emma	What kind of coffee is that?

Alex	No, I just asked for the check.

Emma	Oh.

Alex	So, I’m still a little bit confused about your Cinderella analogy.

Emma	Right, well, I was starting to freak out, so I called my friend Jenny from back home. She’s also my assistant.

Alex	You have an assistant?

Emma	Oh yeah, sure. I've got assistants, cooks, maids, drivers...You name it.
	I’m like rolling in dough, but not the type Ms. Jensen uses to make her pastries.

Alex	Thank you.

Emma	My money is in my suitcase, but I'll pay you back. I promise.

Alex	I believe you. So, Cinderella...

Emma	Right okay, so I realized I was like her but before she met her Prince or her fairy godmother. Although you could be my fairy godmother now that I think about it.

Alex	Nobody has ever called me that before.

Emma	Well, probably because you’re a guy. No actually, maybe Ms. Jensen is my fairy godmother and you’re like, one of the mice that transforms into the horse. Oh no! No no. You're the dog that becomes the footman. That's you!

Alex	You're too kind.

Emma	Well, all I know is Nick is my Prince and we are going to live happily ever after once I find him.

Alex	Like in a fairy tale?

Emma	Exactly. But first I need to find the glass slipper, Which in this case is my missing luggage!

Alex	But if memory serves correctly, doesn’t the Prince find the slipper and then he goes searching for Cinderella?

Emma	This is a modern version. Cinderella just has to do a little more leg work this time around. Which is fine. I’m up for it. That's okay. I’ve got the legs. See? Whoops.

Alex	Yes, very nice.

Emma	Well, I've gotta be in shape if I want to be marrying Nick Milano, tennis player extraordinaire!

Waitress	Nick Milano?

Emma	Oh, you’ve heard of him?

Waitress	Si. Everybody knows Nicky.

Alex	I don't.

Waitress	You are not a woman.

Emma	So, do you know where I can find him?

Waitress	I believe Nick is out of town for a few days. He went to Spain for the weekend. So like Nick.

Emma	Another match, right?

Waitress	Si. Nicky is always in demand.

Emma	Yeah, see. He’s pro. I told you. I can wait for him to return. What are you doing for the weekend?

Alex	I have to go help my parents at the farm.

Emma	A farm? Like in the country?

Alex	Yes, that’s where they’re usually located.

Emma	Great. Well I might join you.

Alex	No, no. I’m not sure you would have much fun. We are not nearly as well-off as you.

Emma	Oh no, that's fine. I’m all about trying new things these days. Except the bread.

Russell	So, you had dinner with her. Making your moves?

Alex	No. There were no moves made. And what is so astonishing about Emma,
	she has nothing but this sense of entitlement.

Russell	American.

Alex	She’s living in a fantasy world. She thinks she’s rich. I’ve just never met anyone like her.

Russell	Is that good thing or a bad thing?

Alex	All I know is once we get back her suitcase, she won’t be my problem anymore. Hello? That's right. Pink with kitties and flowers. That's great! It arrived in Iceland... and is now on flight 1642, on its way to Istanbul. Instanbul. No! Rome, Italy! It’s supposed to be going to Rome, Italy. You know, big Colosseum. Are you kidding me? It's supposed to be going to Rome! It's not possible. Stop laughing!

Diana	Instanbul? Oh Alex, really, why are you doing this to me? Do you hate me? No, I’m not going to tell her. Because I’m trying my best not to kill her. Yeah. That's all on you. Well, you’re going to have to do it. Good luck with that. Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

Emma	Good morning!

Diana	Well, good morning to you too. Did you sleep well?

Emma	Well, you know, the bed is a little harder than I’m used to and the pillows are a bit fluffy. The blanket could definitely do with a good clean, but I’m not complaining.

Diana	Sure. I mean it sounded like you were, but... I know.

Emma	No, Ms. Jensen, you’ve been so great to me. And you know what? I predict that I will not break one glass today. Although I don't think I'm going to be here for much longer because Alex assured me my suitcase will be here today.

Diana	I got an idea. 	Why don't you take a few hours off, and go find Nick? I’m sure he’d love to see you.

Emma	I know. Likewise. But I heard he’s in Spain this weekend.

Diana	Right. Okay. Here.

Emma	Right.

Diana	You know, when I first came to Rome, it was because of a guy as well. But I wasn't chasing him. I was actually running away from a really bad marriage.

Emma	Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.

Diana	I mean, perhaps I’m getting this wrong, but I kind of feel like maybe you’re running away from something too.

Emma	Well, to be honest, I haven’t had a lot of luck with guys in the past. They think I'm spoiled. I think they're jerks.

Diana	Ninety-nine percent of them are jerks. But, I mean, not all of them. Some of them are actually okay. Like Alex... Most of the time.

Emma	And Nick! You know, me and Nick are going to be so happy together. Like, he's just not like the others, you know? We have such a strong connection. And we've got even more in common now.

Diana	Oh yeah? Why's that?

Emma	Well, get this. So he’s a tennis player, right? So he serves balls for a living? Hello. I’m now serving coffee. That's something, right. We're both servers.

Diana	That is something. That is... something.

Emma	Should I go open the door for business?

Diana	Be my guest.

Emma	I already am. Welcome!

Jenny	You wanted to see me, Mr. Thorndyke?

Mr. Thorndyke	Yeah, Jenny, I just printed out Emma’s cell phone bill. So, according to this, you are the very last person she’s called. Therefore, I assume you tell me what she’s doing in Rome?

Emma	Hi. Right, so we've got the macchiato? The caffè d’orzo, caffè corretto, caffè doppio, cappuccino and... americano? Right, let's start that again. The macchiato? Right. So, you get one of these. Yeah, just pick one.

Diana	Emma, I think I'm going to be serving the coffees from now one.

Emma	Oh okay, should I make new ones?

Diana	No.

Emma	Clean?

Diana	No! How about groceries. We need more groceries. Wanna get them?

Emma	Oh shopping, sure. I’m really good at spending money, Ms. Jensen.

Diana	Great. Okay, here we go.

Emma	Awesome!

Diana	Sorry, she’s new. She’s American.

Employee	No, no. No touching.

Emma	Oh, but how do I buy them? Okay. How much are these?

Employee	Must be weighed.

Emma	Okay.

Employee	Not me. You.

Alex	He means you.

Employee	Yes.

Emma	Oh.

Alex	In Italy, we do it ourselves. Thank you.

Employee	You're welcome.

Alex	I talked with Diana. She said she sent you here.

Emma	Yeah. I mean, this shopping thing is so complicated over here.

Alex	It can’t be that different from the States.

Emma	I don’t know. I’ve never been grocery shopping.

Alex	Then how do you eat?

Emma	With my mouth.

Alex	Right. Oh! You have servants and butlers back at home.

Emma	Exactly.

Alex	Five and six.

Emma	Great!

Alex	Done.

Emma	This working thing takes work.

Alex	I have some news about your luggage.

Emma	It arrived?

Alex	No. But we know exactly where it is.

Emma	Alex, I can’t live like this., I’m a girl. I've got needs. Oh my goodness. Finally. Oh yes!

Alex	You need all this?

Emma	Oh, this is just the bare minimum. Besides, I have to look my best for when Nick returns from his tennis tournament in Spain.

Woman 1	Nick? Nicky Milano?

Emma	Oh, you've heard of him?

Woman 1	Yes. Nicky is the best.

Emma	The best tennis player, you mean.

Woman 1	Yes, he gives great lessons. Is he back?

Emma	Oh, I heard in a few days.

Woman 1	Tell him that Isabella and Sofia are ready for their next session.

Emma	Isn't it nice that Nick is willing to share his knowledge to others?

Alex	Yes. This Nick seems like quite the player.

Emma	That much? Well, I guess the time has come.

Alex	So, this is the emergency?

Emma	Well, obviously. Otherwise, I can’t buy what I need.

Employee	No good.

Emma	Oh no, the card's fine. There's a fifty-thousand dollar limit.

Employee	Rejected.

Emma	What did he say?

Alex	Rejected. English.

Employee	Rejected.

Emma	Oh no, that has to be a mistake. Can you please try one more time? Jenny?

Mr. Thorndyke	No, it's your father. So, how's Europe? Having fun? Any issues with your credit card?

Emma	No. How could you, Dad? How could you?

Mr. Thorndyke	How could I? How could you? Chasing after a doggone tennis player all the way to Italy? I mean, you might as well run off with one of those goats from the fundraiser!

Employee	Who pays?

Alex	Who has to pay? I do. "Rejected."

Emma	You don’t understand. Nick and I are in love!

Mr. Thorndyke	Let me speak to him.

Emma	Well, he’s not here at the moment. He's in Spain.

Mr. Thorndyke	Emma, please. Come back. I’ll handle your plane ticket.

Emma	I do not want your money. I can take care of myself, Dad.

Mr. Thorndyke	Oh yeah? Jenny tells me you’re broke. You lost all your money.

Emma	I'm fine. I’m working now.

Mr. Thorndyke	Working? Doing what?

Emma	Goodbye, Father.

Mr. Thorndyke	She’s never worked a day in her life. This I’ve got to see.

Alex	Emma.

Emma	Aw, Alex. You shouldn’t have.

Alex	I know, but you said you needed these things.

Emma	You're so sweet, Alex. I promise I'll pay you back. Right, once your ship comes in. Well, my suitcase. Yeah.

Alex	Who was on the phone?

Emma	Oh, just a very bad man, but I don’t want to talk about it.

Alex	Did he hurt you?

Emma	Well yeah, you could say that he did. He has no respect for my dreams, my desires. He just thinks I’m a little, foolish girl.

Alex	Sounds like you’re better off without him.

Emma	Yeah. Darn right! But now I’m all alone.

Alex	You're not alone. I’m here and so is Diana. Ah! If you want to tag along, I am still heading up to my parents' farm. Near La Fattorietta.

Emma	Oh yeah, I'd love to come! A peaceful weekend in the country. That’s exactly what I need.

Alex	Great. My parents will be thrilled. They love house guests. I suppose.

Russell	So you paid for her groceries and you’re taking her to see your parents tomorrow.

Alex	I already told you. I don't like her.

Russell	Oh, no. You don’t like this girl at all. Okay okay, whatever you say.

Alex	So, did you find the luggage?

Russell	Yeah and I'll make sure it gets on the right flight here.

Alex	Thank you.

Russell	You don't worry about it, alright? Just have a fun time at the family farm. Everything here is under control.

Alex	I can imagine.

Russell	Alrighty. See you, dude.

Mr. Thorndkye	You done? All fine and dandy? Happy?

Russell	What seems to be the problem?
	
Emma	Okay, so tell me about your parents. I mean, why did they become farmers?

Alex	Well, in Italy, most don’t become farmers. You are kind of born into it. It’s a family generational thing going back to my grandparents and their parents before them.

Emma	You must have grown a lot of tomatoes throughout the centuries.

Alex	I suppose we have.

Emma	And then what led you to the lost and found department? Got sick of the tomatoes?

Alex	No, actually I still love them. It was purely, how do you say this, for financial reasons? The farm hasn’t been going too well lately and I needed to get, you know, another job.

Emma	It sucks to be poor, right?

Alex	You tell me. I wouldn't recommend it.

Emma	But cheer up! I mean, you guys can't be in too bad of shape. I mean, you live in Italy. Look around. Most Americans can’t even afford to visit Europe, let alone live here. I mean, the plane ticket alone.

Roberto	Oh, Alessandro!

Martina	Hi, guys! Hi. Is she your friend who got lost?

Alex	Lost and Found friend, Mom. We met at the Lost and Found.

Emma	I'm Emma.

Martina	Hi, Emma. Martina.

Roberto	Hi. I'm Roberto. Welcome.

Emma	Oh, thank you.

Martina	You are thin as a nail, my dear. Do you not eat?

Emma	Oh, well I could do with some tomatoes.

Martina	You came to the right place! Come here, dear!

Roberto	How beautiful is she!

Alex	Yes, but a bit weird, maybe even a bit crazy.

Roberto	She's American.

Alex	Even so, she's a bit different. She still believes in fairy tales. Always looking on the positive side despite the situation. And Diana believes she had a hard life. Doesn’t have a penny to her name, but won’t let that stop her.

Roberto	She should fit right in.

Alex	Just be nice. Don't believe everything she says.

Roberto	Alex. If you like her, we like her. Tough life.

Martina	Here you are.

Emma	It’s the best tomato sandwich I’ve ever tasted.

Martina	Thank you.

Emma	You know, I used to pick tomatoes in the garden with my mom when I was really young. She loved growing things before she got sick.

Alex	Careful Emma, because my parents will put you to work.

Emma	Oh, I don't mind.

Martina	I knew I liked you the first time I saw you.

Roberto	So, would you like to see how the best tomato paste is made?

Emma	Like it? I insist on it.

Roberto	Okay!

Alex	You can do it. Look at you. Well, tomatoes are our business. We have, of course, San Marzano, Pomodorino Vesuviano, Pisanello, Ciliegino di Pachino, Camone, we have a lot. Costoluto Fiorentino...

Martina	Costoluto Fiorentino is a little bit dry. That's why usually you are using it for salads.

Emma	Oh, okay.

Roberto	Yes, and in the winter, when it’s too cold outside, we keep growing them in a greenhouse.

Alex	You can do it.

Emma	A bit too hot. It's good.

Alex	Good, huh? Never stop. Until tomorrow, never stop.

Emma	It's delicious.

Alex	You know, you can pick some tomatoes while they're still green. It lets them continue to ripen and guarantees fresh ones.

Emma	Yeah, I remember my mom always saying they should be smooth and shiny, right?

Alex	That's right.

Emma	See, I know a thing or two.

Alex	Please? Okay.

Emma	Oh, yeah!

Alex	It should have a earthy, sweet smell.

Emma	Oh it's nice.

Alex	Then you need to squeeze it to test the firmness.

Emma	Oops!

Alex	You have to be a little more gentle next time.

Emma	You should really market these tomatoes.  We do!

Roberto	This is our livelihood.

Emma	No, I know. But I mean really market them, so the whole world knows how delicious they are. Oh, no thank you. I’m not really a fan of the bread over here.

Roberto	Try it with Martina’s homemade tomato spread.

Emma	Okay, if you insist.

Roberto	You know, we send our tomatoes out to all the markets and to wholesalers. In jars, cans, boxes, and as jam!

Emma	This is amazing.

Martina	Balsamic tomato spread. My own secret recipe.

Emma	You know, Diana's café could really use some of this. She’s got bread and pastries, but it's not that good. This would make a huge improvement. And that restaurant that we were at the other night. They could use this stuff too.

Roberto	That’s not a bad idea.

Emma	I could ask Diana if she’s interested. And I bet my father could sell this in the States. He’s really successful at importing and exporting goods. That’s where he made his millions. He just knows what makes money, you know? Well, we both do. He used to call me his little financial genius because I have great taste, especially with things that taste great.

Roberto	Well, we could really use someone like you. You know, it’s been a hard year for us.

Martina	And the weather has been very hot in July and August.

Emma	Oh, you need more greenhouses then, to control the conditions, right?

Alex	That costs money, Emma.

Emma	Yeah well, a good investment is a good investment, that's what I always say.

Alex	I’ve never heard you say that.

Emma	Well, because I only say it when I’m talking in business mode. This is probably not an appropriate dinner conversation, but I'm telling you, you're onto something here.

Roberto	So Emma, are you here, are you in Rome for business?

Emma	No, pleasure. I’m in love. With Nick Milano. He’s a professional tennis player. And we’re going to get married.

Alex	So, any further questions? Cheers!

Roberto	Cheers!
	
Martina	Cheers.

Alex	Goodbye.

Martina	I don’t understand.

Roberto	They are young.

Emma	Well, I had a great time.

Alex	Good.

Emma	Your parents started acting a little strange after dinner though, don't you think?

Alex	Yes. I think they thought that...we were dating.

Emma	You and I?

Alex	Yes. As in "we."

Emma	Oh, that’s...That's silly, right?

Alex	Right.

Emma	Right.

Alex	I'll let you know when your luggage arrives.

Emma	Okay, thank you.

Alex	I'm just doing my job.

Emma	Alex, what’s wrong?

Alex	Nothing.

Emma	Are you mad at me?

Alex	Why should I be mad at you? Well, I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking. Listen, some of us have to live in the real world. We cannot afford to believe in fairy tales as you do.

Emma	What is that supposed to mean?

Alex	I’m just saying sometimes things don’t work out as you planned and the slipper doesn’t fit.

Emma	That's mean.

Alex	Yeah, well. The truth can hurt.

Emma	What do you know? You’re just a...

Alex	A dog? Say it. Or was it a mouse?

Emma	A jerk!

Alex	Okay, Cinderella. Then I better leave you, before my car turns into a pumpkin.

Emma	But it already drives like one!

Diana	What’s this?

Emma	It's Balsamic Tomato spread. Absolutely delicious. Put it on all your bread and pastries.

Diana	Alright, thank you. So, how was your weekend?

Emma	Wonderful. And then horrible. What’s wrong with men?

Diana	That's a really long list. Why don't you ask me what’s right with them.

Emma	I mean, he was so sweet and nice the whole time, and then... Out of nowhere, it was Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

Diana	Alex? That doesn’t sound like him.

Emma	Well, I never want to see him for as long as I live.

Diana	Well, I don’t think you're going to have to. because there is somebody waiting for you in your room. He arrived today.

Emma	No. He found out I was here and tracked me down?

Diana	Pretty much.

Emma	Oh God. How do I look?

Diana	Like you.

Emma	Slipper doesn’t fit, huh? Well I’ll show him how perfect my feet are!

Diana	What?

Emma	Just wish me luck!

Diana	Good luck.

Emma	You found me!

Mr. Thorndyke	Oh, you better believe I did.

Emma	Daddy?

Mr. Thorndyke	Who were you expecting? The fairy godmother?

Russell	You don’t look like a man that's in love.

Alex	How many times do I have to tell you? There is nothing going on between Emma and I! Nothing! Zero! She’s in her world and I’m in mine. If I could just get back her suitcase, she’d be out of my life for good.

Russell	I mean, if that’s what you really want.

Alex	That’s exactly what I want. So, has it arrived?

Russell	Almost.

Alex	It can’t so long to get here from Istanbul.

Russell	Oh look, it went through Uruguay, and now it's going up through Africa, it's going to take a couple of days.

Alex	How is this possible? We have to be dealing with every incompetent baggage handler in existence.

Russell	Pretty much. But hey, it's probably going to get here by the time she has to head back.

Alex	My God. That can’t come soon enough.

Russell	So, tell me about your parents. How did it go there?

Alex	She drives everyone crazy. You think you know where you stand with her and then she’s off in another direction. No sense of reality or other people’s feelings. Nothing!

Russell	For someone who doesn't seem to care, you sure seem to care a lot about her.

Alex	Well, I’m done caring.

Alex	It’s someone else’s turn now.

Russell	Well I guess it’s good that her father showed up looking for her.

Alex	What? Her father? But she said she has no family.

Russell	Oh, she has a father, all right. And a mean one, at that. He came in looking for her this morning and I told him she was at Diana’s cafe.

Alex	Are you sure he was her real dad and not a sugar daddy?

Russell	Oh, I'm sure. His name was Howard Thorndyke. I looked him up this morning after he left the airport. He’s a multi-millionaire.

Alex	Oh God. Mamma mia... Then that fantasy world of hers... It's not a lie.

Mr. Thorndyke	Will you eat something other than the bread and whatever that stuff is.

Emma	I’m not hungry.

Mr. Thorndyke	Come on, Emma. You're acting like a kid.

Emma	Because you’re treating me like one.

Mr. Thorndyke	When we get back to the States, everything will be better.

Emma	Oh no, I’m not going back with you.

Mr. Thorndyke	Don’t you at least want to see Jenny? I mean, She misses you.

Emma	I never want to see that tattletale again.

Mr. Thorndyke	She didn't rat you out. Okay? Let's be clear about that. I handle your cell phone bill, remember? Calls from Europe to America are readily apparent on the statement.

Emma	Fine. I’ll pay for my own cell bill then. I’m a working girl now.

Mr. Thorndyke	Look, I appreciate that you want to stand on your own two feet. It’s actually about time. However, no daughter of mine is going to waste away at a coffee shop. Alright? I did not send you to the best schools for you to work at a menial job.

Emma	Yeah, but when Nick and I get married, then I won’t have to work here anymore. You know, I could start my own business.

Mr. Thorndyke	Oh yeah? Doing what?

Emma	Whatever I want. You know, I discovered this tomato farm just outside the city, and with the right management, it could be huge. I already have ideas on how to help them expand their operations.

Mr. Thorndyke	What in God's green earth do you know about tomatoes?

Emma	A lot, actually. That is a Pomodoro di Pachino. It's probably come from the southeast coast of Sicily. And there's four varieties: Ciliegino, Costoluto, Tondo liscio, and Grappolo.

Mr. Thorndyke	Well, you got the lingo down. Who’s been teaching you about tomatoes?

Emma	Oh, just a guy I know. His parents are farmers. They've actually got this really neat place just near La Fattorietta. It's really lovely.

Mr. Thorndyke	So Nick's folks grow tomatoes?

Emma	No. Alex. Alex’s parents.

Mr. Thorndyke	Who's Alex?

Emma	A guy. A different guy.

Mr. Thorndyke	How many guys are you seeing, Emma? Jenny told me you’re in love with this tennis player.

Emma	Oh, I am and I’m not leaving until I see him!

Mr.Thorndyke	So what's up?

Emma	So I get notifications online for anything concerning Nick Milano, and it says here that he’s back in town. Look, he's going to be at the Sportsman’s Lodge tomorrow.

Diana	You know, that's clear across town.

Emma	Oh great. Well that's where I’ll be then, with Nick and you can't stop me. I'd better go prepare for my big day. Goodnight!

Diana	I'm so sorry that I butted in.

Mr.Thorndyke	No no, it doesn't matter. I mean, once her mind is set, there is no stopping her.

Diana	Yeah, I know. She kind of reminds me of me at that age.

Mr.Thorndyke	I just lost my ability to communicate with her.

Diana	You know, if you just...give her a little bit of time, I think she'll turn around.

Mr.Thorndyke	The food's good!

Diana	Glad you like it.

Mr.Thorndyke	Wish I was hungry.

Diana	She’s already gone. Yeah, she got up bright and early this morning, she jumped in a cab, and she went to go surprise Nick at the Sportsman's Lodge.

Mr.Thorndyke	I suspected as much. Okay. Well, let me get a pastry and I need a cup of the strongest coffee you’ve got.

Diana	Coming right up. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Do you mind if I join you?

Mr.Thorndyke	Well, sure! Please do.

Diana	You know, when I first met Emma, I thought she was actually running away from a bad relationship. I didn't realize that when she said "Daddy," she actually meant her real father.

Mr.Thorndyke	You’ve been very kind to her. And I owe you a debt of gratitude for taking her in, Ms. Jensen.

Diana	Diana. And Emma is... She's really a sweet girl, and she really means well. I could see right away. She has a great heart.

Mr.Thorndyke	She always seems to give it to the worst men.

Diana	Actually, that would be my ex-husband. He wins the worst man award, hands down.

Mr.Thorndyke	You got any kids, Diana?

Diana	No, I managed to avoid that mistake.

Mr.Thorndyke	Not a fan of children?

Diana	Oh no, I love children. It was just my male counterpart. Yeah, it worked out for the best.

Mr.Thorndyke	Well, I got lucky there. I found the most amazing woman. But I lost her too soon. You know, it’s kind of hard raising a daughter by yourself. When Margaret got sick, Emma was only twelve and then she passed...I like to think I've done my best, that I've been a good dad.

Diana	Yeah, I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Thorndyke.

Mr.Thorndyke	Howard.

Diana	Howard.

Mr.Thorndyke	I'm going to need another one of these.

Diana	Coming right up. Thank you.

Nick	My love! You have found me!

Emma	I have missed you so much!

Nick	We should never be apart again. Emma Thorndyke, will you marry me?

Emma	Yes. Yes!

Nick	Yes?

Emma	It’s me. From California.

Nick	Oh, yes. Of course. Esther, right?

Emma	No.

Nick	Elizabeth?

Emma	Emma! Emma Thorndyke.
	
Nick	Right.

Emma	Yoga goats?

Nick	Right, Emma and the goats. Nice to see you again. I was just in the middle of giving some personal lessons to a few of my favorite clients.

Woman 1	Yes. Wait your turn.

Nick	Ladies, please, give me a moment.

	
Emma	But I flew all the way here to see you. I thought you were a professional tennis player. Competed at Wimbledon? But you work in a country club?

Nick	I said I’ve been to Wimbledon. Never said I competed there.

Emma	And why are all your clients women?
	
Nick	They appreciate what I have to offer. You should have told me you were coming to Italy.

Emma	I wanted to surprise you.

Nick	Well, you have. Where are you staying? Perhaps we can get together later for drinks.

Emma	Well, I was hoping to stay with you.

Nick	With me? I...I do not think my wife would permit that.

Emma	You’re married? Oh, but you didn't tell me that.

Nick	I also never told you I wasn’t.

Emma	I mean, you weren’t wearing a wedding ring. You're not wearing one now.

Nick	Well, you know, it’s better for business if I don’t. Women like to create these little fantasies in their minds about the tennis instructor and the student...Would you like me to give you a lesson while you’re in town?

Emma	I've learned enough.

Alex	Thank you, goodbye.

Airline Employee	One pink suitcase for Miss Emma Thorndyke.

Alex	That’s it! It’s here!

Airline Employee	It is. I need you to sign here.

Alex	Finally.

Airline Employee	It would help if you didn't keep changing destinations.

Alex	We always wanted it here. In Rome, Italy.

Airline Employee	Well, we have requests to ship this suitcase to Iceland, Turkey, Uruguay, and then South Africa.

Alex	Requests? And from who?

Airline Employee	One...Russell Russo. Thanks, guys.

Alex	What is he talking about?

Russell	Look, it started like a little practical joke.

Alex	A joke?

Russell	Yeah. First, the airline screwed up and sent it over to Japan. And then I saw you getting involved with her and, you know, finding her a place to live, getting her food...And I thought it would be funny if the bag took a bigger detour.

Alex	You use the word funny?

Russell	I thought it was funny. But then my motivations changed when I saw that you started to have, you know, liking her. You took her to your parents' farm. You took her to dinner, and you guys seemed to like each other. So, you know, think of me as a mischievous cupid. You know? Cupid. Love.

Alex	You've got five seconds. And I'm going to kill you.

Russell	I’m taking my lunch break!

Alex	Russell, open the door! Open the door. I'm not doing anything, look! Russell, open the door! Open the door!

Diana	Did Emma have you try this spread last night? You should. Really, this came from Alex’s tomato farm.

Mr. Thorndyke	Great! Not bad. Zesty, but sweet. Emma may be on to something. We could generate a demand for this back in the U.S. Yeah. Kind of unique.

Diana	Wow, you're back so soon. Did you find Nick?

Emma	I did.

Mr. Thorndyke	And? How'd it go?

Emma	Nick is not who I thought he would be. Things between us are over. You know, I’m mature enough to admit when I'm wrong, and I was wrong. I’m moving on.

Diana	Does that mean you’re going to be leaving us?

Mr. Thorndyke	And coming back with me?

Emma	Oh no, no. I'm going to stay here in Rome, and I'm ready to work. You know, I even learned how to say “Nice to meet you” in Italian. Screw you!

Mr. Thorndyke	Say what?

Emma	Dad, you were right. I mean, I have been acting like a child the whole time. It’s about time I grow up.

Mr. Thorndyke	Great.

Emma	And you know, I can't do that while living with you in California. I have to stand on my own two feet. Starting here and now.

Diana	Well I mean, it doesn’t need to be like, here.

Mr. Thorndyke	It needn’t be right now.

Emma	Well no, yes it does. And you know what, I'm ready to work like everyone else. And I'm determined to be the best coffee maker you’ve ever had, Ms. Jensen.

Diana	Help.

Mr. Thorndyke	Yeah look, Emma. I really appreciate the fresh attitude, and that's a fact that  you...But you don’t need to start your new life waiting on people.

Emma	No, I do. I have to build myself up from the bottom. It’s the only way I can be totally independent.

Mr. Thorndyke	Okay.

Alex	Miss Emily Thorndyke, on behalf of the lost and found department at Roma Airport, I wish to present your missing luggage.

Emma	You can throw it out, I don’t need it anymore.

Alex	What?

Emma	I’m starting fresh. No material things.

Alex	Fine. It’s your bag. Good, do with it what you will. My hands are clean.

Emma	Oh, wait! Wait! Here, take this. Here! Take it.

Mr. Thorndyke	Emma! That’s way too big a tip.

Emma	Dad, just stay out of it, please. I told you I’d pay you back.

Alex	I don’t need your money. I don’t need anything from you.

Emma	Can you...?

Mr. Thorndyke	Yep, what? Okay.

Emma	What is your problem?

Alex	No more problems. I did my duty. You’ve got your suitcase, your money, your father...And I am sure you will connect with your tennis player and live happily ever after.

Emma	Well, Mr. Smart Guy, I’ll have you know that my plans have changed. But even if they hadn't, why does my happiness make you so angry?

Alex	I’m not angry. I’m just disappointed.

Emma	About what?

Alex	I thought you were Cinderella.

Emma	No, I thought I was Cinderella. You thought I was nuts.

Alex	Not nuts. I just believed you were this poor, lost girl. Alone, and in need of assistance. I just tried to help.

Emma	And you did. I just wanted to say thank you.

Alex	I don’t need your charity.

Emma	It’s not charity. It’s reimbursement. For dinner, groceries, gas money.

Alex	I have to go. You have your life and I have mine.

Emma	What is that supposed to mean?

Alex	Emma. Listen to me very carefully. We come from two different worlds. And I just don’t fit into yours.

Mr. Thorndyke	So, was that Alex? Another jerk?

Emma	No, he was great. I blew it. I think I'm ready to go home now.

Mr. Thorndyke	Good. I can get us on a flight first thing tomorrow.

Emma	Okay.

Mr. Thorndyke	Hey, but before we go, I want to discuss this tomato business of yours some more.

Emma	No, forget it. It was just a silly idea.

Mr. Thorndyke	No, no. It wasn't a silly idea. I just tried to spread it. It's got real potential.

Emma	You really think so? You’re not just saying it because it's me?

Mr. Thorndyke	No. You know me, when it comes to investments, I put personal matters aside and this is a good one. My little financial genius.

Emma	Don’t try to cheer me up.

Mr. Thorndyke	It’s a father’s duty.

Diana	Yes?

Roberto	Hey. What’s the long face for? What’s going on?

Alex	So, I decided to quit my job at the airport. I think I’d be more useful here with you full-time. I can get rid of my place in town, save money there and...All that.

Martina	Where is Emma?

Roberto	Yes. Where is Emma?

Alex	I found her suitcase and she’s fending for herself now. It’s over.

Martina	But she liked you, Alex. A lot.

Roberto	Yes, and you liked her. Don’t deny it. We saw you two together.

Alex	I don’t want to talk about Emma anymore. She was not who I thought she was.

Martina	How so?

Alex	I thought she was poor. Turns out she’s rich.

Martina	And you’re going to hold that against her?

Roberto	She didn’t lie to you. Remember, she told us she was wealthy.

Alex	I know, but I didn’t believe her.

Martina	And you're mad because she told you the truth?

Alex	She also said that she felt like Cinderella.

Roberto	So what’s wrong with that, Alex? Most women want to be Cinderella.

Alex	Yes, but Cinderella was poor, beaten down. She wasn’t a wealthy, upper-class citizen.

Martina	Yes, she was. In the beginning, Cinderella was just Ella, the daughter of a very wealthy family. Then her father remarried, but when he died, her stepmother and her sisters took over the estate and turned Ella into Cinderella, to be their servant girl.

Alex	Are you sure the story was like that?

Roberto	Then the fairy godmother comes, grants the wishes she goes to the ball, meets the prince...

Alex	Yes Dad, I know the rest of the story. But I’m no prince!

Martina	You’re a prince as far as we’re concerned.

Roberto	And if she’s smart, she’ll see that too.

Alex	I’m going to bed. Goodnight.

Roberto	And if you’re smart, you’ll make her see it! Goodnight.

Mr. Thorndyke	Yep, we'll get all the details worked out when I’m back in California. Yep. Get contracts drawn up immediately. Yeah, I am looking forward to partnering with you as well, Roberto. Bye! Yeah, have a nice day, sir.

Emma	And make sure to try the tomato spread. It is so delicious.

Mr. Thorndyke	Emma, we've got like ten minutes max if we’re going to make that flight.

Emma	Yeah, yeah. I’m already packed. I just need to make one more marocchino.

Diana	She’s really got the hang of this. Talented girl.

Mr. Thorndyke	Yeah. I’ve always known that.

Diana	I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but I think I’m actually going to miss her.

Mr. Thorndyke	Guess what? I’m going to miss you. Yeah, you’re really the first woman I’ve been able to talk to in a long, long time.

Diana	You know, Howard, I feel the same about you. I mean, you've actually restored my faith in men.

Mr. Thorndyke	Well, that's good. I hope we can get together again sometime soon.

Diana	Well, you know where to find me.

Mr. Thorndyke	I do. And believe me, I'll be back for business. And pleasure.

Diana	I look forward to that.

Mr. Thorndyke	Don't work too hard. Hey! Time's wasting, young lady.

Alex	What are you both smiling about?

Martina	Your father just got off the phone with Mr. Thorndyke.

Roberto	Your girlfriend came through with all of her promises. She talked to her father about our tomatoes and Martina’s spread, and he wants to partner with us! You know, she's willing to make a big investment.

Martina	We're back in business!

Roberto	Yes!

Alex	That’s great but...As I told you, Emma’s not my girlfriend, so...

Roberto	Well, I guess that’s for the best, since she’s leaving Italy at 11:45 on flight 490, with her Father. They’re going back to America.

Alex	And what about Nick Milano? That guy she was in love with.

Martina	I guess he lost that match.

Roberto	Yeah. Her father said that she had fallen for someone, but then he rejected her.

Martina	Who could be so foolish? She's so great. She's so smart, she's so young, she's so pretty, she's...

Alex	I got to go.

Martina	Yes, you do!

Roberto	Go get her, son. Run! Alex, run!

Martina	Good!

Mr. Thorndyke	Thanks, man! Come on.

Alex	Hurry up! I’m running late.

Mr. Thorndyke	Thank you.

Emma	And can you check if Alex Malvesi is working here today?

Woman at Counter	Malvesi...

Emma	I'd like to say goodbye.

Mr. Thorndyke	Sure.

Woman at Counter	He's not here. His name is not listed in the directory either. I believe he no longer works here.

Emma	Oh, okay.

Mr. Thorndyke	Hey, I'm sure I can get us on a later flight...

Emma	No, let's just get on the plane.

Mr. Thorndyke	You got it. Okay. Now, look, with the luggage. Please. Make doubly certain it gets on the right plane. We had an issue coming out. Alright? Good. And is the gate on there? Good.

Woman at Counter	Yup.

Mr. Thorndyke	We go to the lounge? Good?

Woman at Counter	Have a nice trip!

Alex	Come on, move! I’m running late. Emma, please wait for me. What time i it?

Russell	Hello?

Alex	Yeah, Russell! I need two favors from you right now. You owe me. Make it happen!

Russell	Sure, yeah. Go!

Alex	Attention! Attention! Will Miss Emma Thorndyke please make her way to the lost and found desk. There is a lost item that needs immediate identification.

Mr. Thorndyke	What? You've got to be kidding me. What, again?

Alex	A young man has misplaced his heart and believes that Emma Thorndyke is currently in possession of it. We have it on good authority that Miss Thorndyke may have indeed stolen his heart!

Emma	Come on!

Alex	Not that he needs it back. He just wanted to make sure you lost it. I'm at the lost and found. You found my heart. Safe and sound because he... because he loves her.

Emma	You know you could have just called me directly. You've got my number.

Alex	Yes, but where’s the fun in that? I’ve behaved like an idiot. So it takes an idiotic gesture like this to hopefully...set things right.

Emma	Don’t you know being in love means you never have to say you’re an idiot.

Russell	She's got a point.

Alex	I'm really sorry. It took me so long to come to my senses.

Emma	I’m sorry for the way I treated you. You were right. I was caught up in a fairy tale, and I couldn't see that Mr. Right was in front of me the whole time.

Alex	Speaking of fairy tales, there is one last thing. You left this behind when you stayed at my parents' house.

Emma	Did I really?

Alex	No. I actually had Russell grab your suitcase from the plane and pull it out. Thank you.

Emma	Wow, how fitting.

Alex	I was lost until I found you.

Emma	We found each other.

Roberto	I don’t know how to thank you enough, Howard.

Jenny	He's cute.

Alex	My best worst man here, Russell, wanted to meet your friend.

Emma	Oh, this is Jenny. Jenny's in PR.

Jenny	Hello.

Russell	Hello, Jenny. So are all your relationships public or do you do some private ones as well?

Jenny	Well, that depends on the clientele.

Mr. Thorndyke	And anyway, we’re practically family now.

Martina	And perhaps there's going to be a wedding very soon. Or two?

Diana	We’re just taking it one day at a time.

Mr. Thorndyke	Yeah, but...taking a place around the corner from the Ristoretto E Corretto was a pretty big first step.

Diana	No regrets?

Mr. Thorndyke	No. Very sweet.

Jenny	So, what do you do, Russell?

Russell	Oh, I’m like the Wizard of Italy I'll make your dreams come true.

Jenny	Oh, tell me more.

Emma	Oh, I love you, Mr. Malavasi.

Alex	And I love you, Miss Thorndyke. Soon to be Mrs. Thorndyke-Malvesi. Or Malvesi-Thorndyke? Or should I take your last name?

Emma	We’ll figure it out.

Alex	Yes.

EVERYONE	Cheers!
