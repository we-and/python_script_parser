BLAKE	We can’t afford any of these houses.

SARAH	Look, Daddy’s going to help  with the down payment.

BLAKE	He doesn’t even like me.

SARAH	Well, he just doesn’t know you well enough yet.

BLAKE	This is it? It can’t be. 

BLAKE	This is like a palace.

SARAH	I think this is the place.

BLAKE	This is it?

SARAH	Oh, there’s Edna’s car.

SARAH	Okay, Mr. Bad Cop.

SARAH	What’s the plan?

BLAKE	Okay, we’ve seen, what…

BLAKE	six, seven houses already?

SARAH	11.

BLAKE	11. Right. Yeah. Perfect.

BLAKE	Okay. 

SARAH	We go in there stone-faced.

BLAKE	We show zero emotion, okay?

SARAH	Stone-faced.

BLAKE	No matter how much we love this place...

BLAKE	we gotta keep our poker faces, okay? 

BLAKE	 I’ll be bad cop.

EDNA	Hey, you two!

BLAKE	Shut up and take our money.

EDNA	I knew you’d like it.

EDNA	Why don’t you two follow me into the kitchen.

SARAH	 Poker face?

BLAKE	Oh, holy shit, this kitchen!

SARAH	Wow.

BLAKE	 I mean, I want to learn how to make souffles in this kitchen.
 
SARAH	 This coming from a man who can’t even microwave hot dogs in my apartment? 

BLAKE	You’re goddamn right.

SARAH	Impressed.

SARAH	So what’s the catch?

BLAKE	 Holy shit, this backyard! 

SARAH	 Shut up and take our money.

EDNA	It’s one of the largest yards in the area. 

EDNA	Ready for barbeques and summer fun and debauchery. 

BLAKE	Look at this pool. You know what that means.

BLAKE/SARAH	Aquarobics…

BLAKE	…nude.

SARAH	Does every one of your scenarios involve me being naked?

BLAKE	I mean, I don’t know. 

BLAKE	What’s that noise?

EDNA	What?

BLAKE	That loud throbbing.

SARAH	It’s like a…

EDNA	Oh, I don’t hear anything.

BLAKE	Okay.

SARAH	There’s definitely, like, a…

BLAKE	Throbbing baseline.

BLAKE	It’s pretty loud.

EDNA	Oh!

BLAKE	Yeah. Yes.

EDNA	That? Oh, that’s nothing. 

EDNA	That’s absolutely nothing.

EDNA	There’s just someone in the guest house.

BLAKE	Oh. Okay, yeah.

SARAH	Okay.

RANDY	Are you guys here for the party?

SARAH	 Hell, no.

RANDY	Wait, wait, wait. Come back! Come back!

SARAH	- We’ve seen enough. Thank you. Thank you. That’s great.

SARAH	That’s enough.

EDNA	No, guys. Wait, wait, wait.

EDNA	Trust me.

SARAH	No. No.

EDNA	He’ll be out of here in a month. You could use it as rental property.

RANDY	24 hour notice, Edna. 24 hour notice. You know that shit.

EDNA	I texted you, faxed you, DM’d you.

EDNA	 I hit you up on Myspace!

RANDY	 Well, you know I don’t check my social media platforms…

RANDY	or my text messages when I’m fucking on hallucinogenics. 

EDNA	 Oh, but somehow you managed to respond with a dick pic!

RANDY	 Yeah, and you should be thanking me.That was my penis’s good side.

EDNA	 Your penis looked depressed.

RANDY	Well, here it is, guys. This is it. 

RANDY	This is the guest house, okay?

RANDY	It’s a smaller version of the big house…

RANDY	except for it smells like bong water and K-Y.

RANDY	Okay, you seens it, now take off.

SARAH	 I think I’m gonna be sick.

RANDY	Oh, go ‘spatch, ‘spatch!

EDNA	Sarah! 

EDNA	It’s not that bad!

RANDY	You want to smoke some weed, bro?

BLAKE	Oh! No. No, I’m good.

BLAKE	Thank you so much, but…

BLAKE	No, I haven’t smoked anything in a really long time, so…

RANDY	Yeah.

BLAKE 	Great. Okay.

BLAKE	You got so much cool random stuff in here.

RANDY	Yeah, well, I’m a collector of old artifacts.

BLAKE	Oh my God! You have a bomb! 

RANDY	Yeah.

BLAKE	That’s so cool.

RANDY	That’s cool.

RANDY	But what about this right here? This is Tommy Lee’s sex swing.

BLAKE	Right on. Great.

BLAKE	Cool.

RANDY	All right, listen. 

RANDY	Let’s get down to brass tacks, here.

BLAKE	 Okay.

RANDY	What is it? What’s your name? Blake?

BLAKE	Blake, yeah. Yeah.

RANDY	Blake. Yeah. Take a seat.

RANDY	So here’s the deal. Let me just ask you a question. 

RANDY	Are you guys really thinking about buying this place…

RANDY	or are you just passing through?

BLAKE	Well, actually, you know, I think we’re pretty serious about it.

BLAKE	We really…

BLAKE	Okay.

RANDY	 Really? Here. You want it?

BLAKE	No, no, no. That’s not why I was looking at it.

RANDY	It’s Peruvian. Just came in from El Chapo.

BLAKE	Wow. It’s still morning.

RANDY	Yeah.

RANDY	Yeah. It’s pretty great. Listen, if you buy the place…

RANDY	If you buy it, right, I mean, I can stay in the guest house, right? 

RANDY	I’ll pay rent and shit. We’re good, right? Straight?

BLAKE	Well, that sounds awesome. It really does. 

BLAKE	But, you know, we’re thinking, like, if we buy the place…

RANDY	Here.

BLAKE	 No, I’m good. Thank you. 
 
BLAKE	We’re thinking if we buy the place, we’d want access to all of it…

BLAKE	which would include the guest house.

BLAKE	You understand. 

RANDY	Copy. Copy. Gotcha. Gotcha.

RANDY	All right. 

BLAKE	 Well, this was awesome. 

BLAKE	Very nice to meet you, Mr.…?

RANDY	Cockfield. 

RANDY	Randy Cockfield.

BLAKE	bye.

SARAH	Bye. Thank you!

SARAH	Are you fricken’ kidding me?

BLAKE	 I know.

BLAKE	But we have to give him time to move out.

SARAH	I know. Edna told me. I just don’t feel comfortable…

SARAH	allowing some weirdo to live in our guest house for three months.

SARAH	You think we can get him out quicker?

BLAKE	I don’t know.

BLAKE	 I mean, he’s like an entrepreneur-collector guy.

BLAKE	 You know, you saw all of his stuff.

SARAH	 What kind of entrepreneur lives in someone’s guest house?

BLAKE	 A frugal one? 

BLAKE	 I don’t know. I mean, I didn’t sit down and talk with him…

BLAKE	about all of his finances and everything. 

BLAKE	Look, I know that this is weird. I do.

SARAH	You think?

BLAKE	But aren’t you tired?

BLAKE	I’m so tired. I just want to…

BLAKE	I want to just lay down. I want to be home.

BLAKE	And just say we live here now. We’re not going anywhere.

SARAH	I do love that yard.

BLAKE	And the…What about the gazebo?

SARAH	Promise me he’ll be out soon. That guy gives off weird vibes.

BLAKE	I pinky promise.

SARAH	I’m serious, babe.

BLAKE	I’m serious. I promise.

BLAKE	As soon as we get settled in here,I will march right out there…

BLAKE	and I’ll say, “You’ve got to get out of here in three months.”

BLAKE	He’s going to end up…

BLAKE	A week. We can get him out of there in a week.

BLAKE	We’re doing this.

SARAH	We are. We are doing this.

BLAKE	Yeah. This is us. We’re doing this.

SARAH	I mean, I love this photo.

BLAKE	Oh.

BLAKE	 Well, take a look at this.

SARAH	 Later, brah.

BLAKE	Later, brah.

RANDY	Yeah!

BLAKE	Dude, what the fuck?!

BLAKE	Look, if you guys are going to have sex, can you at least close the door?

SUNNY	Close it and join us.

RANDY	Yeah!

BLAKE	No.

RANDY	Join us, Blake!

BLAKE	Look, we need to set a time for you to move out.

BLAKE	It’s delicate.

SARAH	 Blake! Blake, get in here!

BLAKE	Yeah?

SARAH	 Someone’s been in our kitchen.

BLAKE	What?

SARAH	The cupboards are empty…

SARAH	groceries are gone. Even the gluten-free cookies are gone! 

SARAH	 Like, seriously, who the fuck eats those?

BLAKE	 Randy, obviously. The fucking moron.

SARAH	 You moved a lot of boxes today.

BLAKE	 Yeah, I really did, didn’t I? It’s crazy.

SARAH	 So I thought that you deserve to be rewarded, and…

BLAKE	Oh!

SARAH	tonight, I thought we could do…

SARAH	anything that you wanted.

BLAKE	You know, this is a judgement-free zone, right?

SARAH	Yeah.

BLAKE	Remember the other day…

BLAKE	when you were talking to me like a dude?

BLAKE	 Yeah, it kind of… something about it, because it’s…

BLAKE	you’re acting like a dude, but it’s you, but it’s…

BLAKE	you doing that voice or--

SARAH	 Shh, shh, shh. I gotcha.

SARAH	 Fuck me, brah.

BLAKE	 What? 

SARAH	 What? You hard of hearing there, Chief? I said, fuck me, brah.

BLAKE	 Oh, yeah. Yeah, that really works for me. 

SARAH	Oh, fuck me, brah!

BLAKE	Oh, my God!

SARAH	What the fuck?

BLAKE	Sorry.

BLAKE	It looks like he’s  just doing ayahuasca.

SARAH	Ayahuasca? What the hell is that?

RANDY	It’s where you drink a tea from a root and…

RANDY	you get all sick and have a spiritual experience.

RANDY	You’ll be all right, my brothers. Just let it out. 

RANDY	You’re trying to get all the negativity out.

BLAKE	Let’s not let this get in the way.

BLAKE	, bro.

SARAH	 Yeah, brosof.

SARAH	Dude! What the fuck?!

BLAKE	No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

SARAH	Dude, I can’t. Dude!

BLAKE	Wait, wait, wait. I’ll really work. Hold on. Look.

BLAKE	Come on.

SARAH	He’s, like, dying out there.

BLAKE	Well, it’s part of the experience.

SARAH	I can’t. 

RANDY	You got to get all the negativity out.

BLAKE	Don’t just…

RANDY	Get the negativity out!

BLAKE	Fucking Randy.

SARAH	Oh, God. All you need is LOVE

SARAH	Wake up!

BLAKE	Why am I being attacked?

RANDY	Fuck! Oh, shit!

RANDY	Blake! Blake! What are you doing in my room? What are you doing in my room?

BLAKE	Relax. Take it in. 

BLAKE	Take it in.

RANDY	Oh, God.

BLAKE	You’ve got to be out by the end of the day, okay? 

BLAKE	If you need help paying for a hotel or…

BLAKE	fuck, or anything, I’ll help you out, but dude, you crossed a line.

BLAKE	All right? Passing out in front of our house?

BLAKE	Sarah is pissed, and I’m with her on this one.

RANDY	Yeah? Well, you tell Sarah that when it comes to tenants’ rights…

RANDY	in California, it’s always pro-motherfucking-tenant.

RANDY	Guess what I am, bro? Huh?
 
RANDY	I’m your motherfucking tenant!

RANDY	God damn it, you’re beautiful. 

BLAKE	Fuck. Fuck it. I’ve got to get high.

BLAKE	Please.

RANDY	Yes!

BLAKE	Fuck it.

RANDY	It was just a matter of time!

RANDY	Bam!

BLAKE	You know, a few years ago…

BLAKE	we totally would’ve been friends. Like, in college…

BLAKE	I was a full-on wild man. All my friends thought I was a legend.

RANDY	Oh, shit. Well, let’s do some coke, bro.

BLAKE	Huh? Oh. No, no. no.

BLAKE	Just weed’s fine. Weed’s fine.

RANDY	Oh. Copy. Copy. 

RANDY	Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha.

BLAKE	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

BLAKE	But, I do want to get, like, very high.

BLAKE	Not regular high, but, like, really high.

RANDY	How high?

BLAKE	As high as I can possibly get.

BLAKE	I’ll do anything.

RANDY	You’ll do anything?

BLAKE	Yeah, anything.

RANDY	Fucking anything?

RANDY	Anything?

BLAKE	Anything, dude.

RANDY	Come on. Come on. 

RANDY	Let’s go. Let’s go!

BLAKE	I am not fucking doing that.

RANDY	You said you’d do anything.

BLAKE	I’m not doing that.

RANDY	Just repeat after me, okay? It’s very simple. “I’m not gay.”

BLAKE	I’m not gay.

RANDY	I’m not gay.

BLAKE	I’m not gay.

RANDY	So then you’re good to do it.

RANDY	Now suck it. Let’s go.

BLAKE	No, dude, of all the pipes…

BLAKE	you got in this place, why do I got to smoke out of this one?

RANDY	It’s how I sort out my pretenders.

BLAKE	No.

RANDY	Okay? If you can suck on Randy Cockfield’s dick pipe…

RANDY	you’re good with me. Let’s go. Suck it. 

RANDY	You like chicks. I know you have a chick. Just, come on. Come close.

BLAKE	Fine.

RANDY	Come on. Get close.

BLAKE	Okay. Okay.

BLAKE	Delete that shit!

RANDY	No, no, no!

BLAKE	Delete that! Delete that shit!

RANDY	No, no, no.

RANDY	I need more followers, bro.

BLAKE	Dude, I have a job. I have a girlfriend.
 
BLAKE	Delete that shit.

BLAKE	Oh, my God! Whoa!

RANDY	Yeah!

BLAKE	Dude, I’m totally going to sneak in here all the time and smoke that dick!

RANDY	I underestimated you, for real.

BLAKE	Oh, yeah.

BLAKE	Thank you, man. I like hanging out with you, man. It’s very fun.

RANDY	If you want to hang hard, dude…

RANDY	check this shit out. Look. Look. 

BLAKE	Okay.

RANDY	Check out what’s in the box.

BLAKE	Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

BLAKE	So you’re, like, you’re like a drug addict, huh?

RANDY	No. No. Look, I’m a drug connoisseur. 

RANDY	Yeah. Yeah…

BLAKE	Cool.

RANDY	Mixing and matching the drugs is precisely how…

RANDY	you don’t get addicted to the drugs.

BLAKE	Smart.

RANDY	Yeah. You gotta mix and match.

BLAKE	That’s really smart.

RANDY	But there is one drug that I’m missing.

BLAKE	What’s that?

RANDY	Dude, your fucking head is going to spin when you see this shit.

NEWS REPORTER #1	We’re talking about Flakka.

NEWS REPORTER #2	Flakka.

NEWS REPORTER #3	 The drug is called Flakka.

NEWS REPORTER #4	Some are calling it “the insanity drug.”

NEWS REPORTER #5	…the insanity drug. 

NEWS REPORTER #5	It is described as the scariest drug in the world.

NEWS REPORTER #6	Way more powerful than heroin or cocaine…

NEWS REPORTER #6	it is a synthetic drug that will alter your state-of-mind.

NEWS REPORTER #7	…extreme delirium, raising body temperature…

NEWS REPORTER #7	and causing people to literally lose their minds.

BLAKE	Dude, you cannot do the Flakka, man.
RANDY	Why not?

BLAKE	It’s a bad drug!

RANDY	Yeah, fucking bad-ass.

BLAKE	You can’t do that in my house, man. That’s bad.

RANDY	What’s so bad about it? It’s not even fucking in California yet. Relax, dude.

BLAKE	All right, well that’s good. That’s good.

RANDY	Yet.

BLAKE	No.

RANDY	My friend Benny’s this region’s supplier. He’s bringing the shit over.

BLAKE	Dude, no. It’s a no, man. I mean, I don’t want that on my property.

BLAKE	f Sarah found out…

RANDY	Oh, Sarah.

RANDY	You know, fucking Sarah. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, all right?

RANDY	Dude, fuck.

BLAKE	You know what? Hey, fuck you…

BLAKE	Randy, you fucking asshole.

RANDY	You know what? You can’t hang…

RANDY	with me anyways, you little party pussy!

RANDY	You’re a ‘spatch. Get out of my place.

BLAKE	Yeah, I’ll ‘spatch, you fucking pathetic crusty fuck.
 
RANDY	Yeah, you can’t even hang out in my lair, you piece of shit. 

SARAH	Hey, babe? Maybe we can stop by the hardware store and get…

SARAH	some lights for the gazebo?

BLAKE	Yeah, that’d be…

BLAKE	Yeah, that’d be… Great.

SARAH	Did you have the talk with Randy today?

BLAKE	I… Yeah. Yeah. We… more…

BLAKE	Yeah, more or less, we had the talk.

BLAKE	It got… It was serious, and he’s…

BLAKE	he’s now, he’s dedicated to finding a new place, so…

SARAH	 Blake.

BLAKE	Was that… Yeah.

SARAH	Are you okay?

BLAKE	I’m good. Yeah. Yeah.

BLAKE	I’m… Yeah. I’m, like, tired. I’m kind of tired from, like…

BLAKE	I didn’t sleep that great.

SARAH	You’re high.

BLAKE	No, I’m not. You’re… 
SARAH	 You’re totally high.

BLAKE	You… He was smoking…

BLAKE	And I may have breathed some in.

SARAH	Just stop talking.

BLAKE	Okay.

BLAKE	Well, but I do think you should know, there was a cloud.

BLAKE	Like a cloud, and then--

SARAH	Look, Blake, I asked you to go…

SARAH	out there and do one thing, just get rid of the guy…

SARAH	and instead, you get baked with him?

BLAKE	No, I didn’t. I was, like, we were unwinding. 

BLAKE	I was just unwinding. Like, I’ve been stressed.

SARAH	Oh. Oh, you’ve been stressed.

SARAH	You know, you know, I’ve been stressed, too. 

SARAH	You know? Teaching 48 second graders a day isn’t easy.

BLAKE	Yeah. Oh, I know.

SARAH	Do you really?

SARAH	Because while you go off to your skateboarding job every day…

SARAH	and talk about things that nobody over 30 cares about…

SARAH	I’m dealing with angry parents and trying…

SARAH	to figure out how to pay for school supplies with zero budget, and…

SARAH	then I get to come home and deal with this shit. 

SARAH	I have students who are way more mature than you are.

BLAKE	I feel like that’s kind of unfair. I mean, I haven’t, like…

BLAKE	smoked to anything in, like, a long time.

BLAKE	She got you, man. She’s right.

DOUGLAS	What’s happening, sweet pea? 

SARAH	I think Blake’s on drugs. 

SARAH	Again.

DOUGLAS	Good. Then maybe the two of you should take a little break.

DOUGLAS	Or a long break. Or a permanent break.

SARAH	Dad, you’re not helping.

SARAH	I need some dad advice.

SARAH	I love him, but I don’t…

SARAH	I don’t know what to do. 

DOUGLAS	Sweetheart…

DOUGLAS	if you are certain that you love this boy…

DOUGLAS	then just make sure that you have the unwavering devotion…

DOUGLAS	and dedication that your mother and I share.

SARAH	Got it. I’ve got to…I’ve got to go work this out.

DOUGLAS	Do you want to use my hotel room?

SARAH	What?

DOUGLAS	I keep a hotel room.

DOUGLAS	For the last few months, I’ve had a room in town.

DOUGLAS	You’re welcome to… Okay.

DOUGLAS	No. No. No problem.

SARAH	No, that’s, yeah. 

DOUGLAS	Have you heard from Kip?

SARAH	Nope. 

SHREDD	Fire in the fucking hole! Oh, shit!

SHREDD	Dude!

SHREDD	I am not stoked to admit this, dude, but we should tone it down on the turbo.

BLAKE	All right, do you need, like, medical attention or anything?

BLAKE	Are you good?

SHREDD	 Come on, dude.

BLAKE	Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry.

SHREDD	 Just come with me. Let’s talk. Let’s talk.

BLAKE	We just released that promotional video… 

BLAKE	for the skate-wear line, and it’s trending.

BLAKE	We got a shout-out on Kimmel last night. 

BLAKE	All of our social media’skind of blowing up. 

BLAKE	Plus that kid’s mom, she’s not pressing charges anymore.

BLAKE	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

SHREDD	 Nice!

BLAKE	And now you’re exactly seven weeks out…

BLAKE	from being able to skateboard on public property.

SHREDD	Yeah… Hey, dude, you know I’ve enjoyed this time…

SHREDD	to be intimate with my people, right?

BLAKE	Oh, and everyone here loves having you around, Mr. Kapinsky. 

SHREDD	Blakey-Blake, I have one rule. You know this.

SHREDD	I’m not “mister.” I’m damn well not “sir.”

BLAKE	Right.

SHREDD	Who am I?

BLAKE	You’re Shredd.

SHREDD	Yeah. And why?

SHREDD	36 skin grafts!

SHREDD	Zero real teeth, and more fucking metal than you can shake a dick at.

BLAKE	Right.

SHREDD	 Right? And what’s all that from?

BLAKE	Shredding it so fucking hard.

SHREDD	 That’s right, man.

SHREDD	Fucking shredding!

BLAKE	I’ll take that.

BLAKE	Oh! Jesus!

SHREDD	 Fuck!

BLAKE	Oh, yeah.

SHREDD	Why do I have to always hit a fucking stud?

BLAKE	Because you are fucking Shredd, sir.

BLAKE	That’s why. Yeah.

SHREDD	 That’s right, man.

SHREDD	Fucking epic!

BLAKE	Oh, my God! Oh, that

SHREDD	Let’s see some skating around here!

SHREDD	Go! All right! All right.

SARAH	Isn’t the architecture great? I mean…

SARAH	I can see myself getting married in this house.

TAYLOR	Ser-bear, I love you, so I’m going to tell you this as delicately as possible.

TAYLOR	You could do so much better.

SARAH	I love Blake.

SARAH	He’s amazing. I mean, he’s everything

TAYLOR	Listen, whatever you decide…

TAYLOR	know that I’ll always have your back. 

TAYLOR	I just, I always envisioned your life differently, you know, like…

TAYLOR	well, like mine where I have this job where I don’t do a lot of work…

TAYLOR	but I make a lot of money.

SARAH	I know. And I know he’s the one.

TAYLOR	You know? You know? Just like in college…

TAYLOR	when you knew that you didn’t like girls.

SARAH	Seriously?

SARAH	Don’t even right now.

SARAH	If Blake heard you, he would never stop hounding me for a threesome.

TAYLOR	Shit, really? You know I’m totally down for that.

RANDY	Whoa!
RANDY	Oh!

RANDY	Hey, Skippy, what’s up, boy? 

RANDY	Meow. 

RANDY	Jesus. That’s not a fucking cat. 

RANDY	Blake? 

RANDY	What the fuck? 

RANDY	Blake, there’s a…

RANDY	there’s a God damn muskrat on your porch! Help! Blake!

JENNY	Looks like someone’s off the market.

JENNY	I mean, you’re not married yet.

BLAKE	Yeah.

JENNY	Right?

BLAKE	No.

JENNY	So what do you say we have one last office fling?

BLAKE	Holy shit. I don’t…

BLAKE	I don’t think that we can do that.

JENNY	Yeah.

BLAKE	I don’t know if I should.

JENNY	Come on. What happened to fun Blake?

BLAKE	No, he’s right here. I’m still super fun…

BLAKE	I just, you know, I’m serious with Sarah and, you know…

JENNY	You want to shred me?

BLAKE	I shouldn’t.

BLAKE	You don’t… Hey, hey, hey. Let’s just pause this. Take a beat on--

SHREDD	Blakey-Blake! Whoa!

BLAKE	Hey.

BLAKE	No.

SHREDD	 What the fuck are you doing?

BLAKE	I’m not… It’s not what it looks like. 

SHREDD	Come on, there. You’re unbuckled, your fly’s down.

BLAKE	Look, I don’t know how she got the fly down.

BLAKE	That was all that happened. It was a misunderstanding.

SHREDD	Bro man, dude. You have a woman now.

SHREDD	You got me really worried about you.

BLAKE	I appreciate…

SHREDD	I don’t like it!

BLAKE	Got it. Sorry.

BLAKE	Yep.

BLAKE	How was everything? Would you say your spinach was leafy?

SARAH	Look, I’m sorry.I’ve been stressed with work and…

BLAKE	Yeah, no, no. I know. I’m sorry, though, too, obviously. 

BLAKE	I should be more sorry than you. I mean, the Randy situation is horrible…

BLAKE	but none of that really matters.

BLAKE	This is all that matters. You and me.

SARAH	I love you.

BLAKE	I love you too.

BLAKE	I love you.

BLAKE	And I want to marry you. 

BLAKE	I don’t actually have a ring, but I thought I could do that.

BLAKE	I just kind of arrived at this. 

SARAH	Is this a mean, mean joke? 

BLAKE	No. I’m not joking. I’m so serious.

SARAH	You’re, like, for real real?

BLAKE	Yeah. We can do it here in this house.

BLAKE	What better way to christen it?

SARAH	Don’t fuck with me.

BLAKE	I’m not fucking with you.

RANDY	You guys, I just needed a can opener. 

BLAKE	Jesus.

RANDY	No, I need a can opener. 

BLAKE	There is no chance you don’t…

SARAH	We don’t have one. We don’t have one.
 
BLAKE	…have a can opener.

RANDY	Is this a bad time, or…?

BLAKE	This is an extremely bad time.

SARAH	Yeah.

RANDY	Really? Did you drop your contact or something?

BLAKE	No.

BLAKE	It’s more serious than--

RANDY	Oh, shit. I’m sorry. Sorry, sorry.

SARAH	Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

RANDY	Okay. Okay.

SARAH	We’re having a moment.

DOUGLAS	Are you insane?

SARAH	Yes, yes. Skateboard boy. Yes.

DOUGLAS	Listen… Forget what I said!

SARAH	Blake…

DOUGLAS	You absolutely need advice!

SARAH	 I know, Dad. Dad, Dad, Dad.

SARAH	Your advice, it was so helpful. 

DOUGLAS	No, whoa, shush.

OFFICER FORD	 What kind of man smells this good?

BLAKE	 I shower regularly.

OFFICER FORD	What kind of a man smells this good?

BLAKE	 There’s no secret!

RANDY	Follow me on my social media platforms, officer.

OFFICER FORD	 What is it?

RANDY	 @TheRandyCockfield.

OFFICER FORD	Dispatch, I got another asshole coming in.

BLAKE	There’s no way that call went in. There is no way you talk--

OFFICER FORD	Literally and figuratively, I got a asshole coming in.

SERGEANT WINTERS	Be sure to call the front desk if you need anything.

SARAH	Blake, what the hell happened to our backyard?

SARAH	I don’t know where you are, but you’re not here. 

SARAH	I’ve got the girls coming over to try on their dresses…

SARAH	and you know what? I don’t know. 

SARAH	I don’t know if I can go through with this wedding anymore. 

SARAH	I even knocked on Randy’s fucking door.

SARAH	What happened?! What is this?!

SARAH	Somebody put dicks everywhere.

SARAH	Some asshole turned our entire property into a bag of dicks!

SARAH	Blake!

SARAH	Where are you?

SARAH	I don’t even know where he is. 

SARAH	What if he’s, like, dead in a ditch somewhere…

SARAH	or I don’t know, maybe he got scared and just left me.

TAYLOR	I’d call that a good fucking day.

TAYLOR	There’s a shit-ton of dicks in your backyard. 

TAYLOR	I’d say that’s a bad omen.

MICHELLE	There aren’t that many dicks. You can fix this.

MICHELLE	It’s not that bad.

SARAH	It’s a dick-splosion.

MICHELLE	I don’t know. I always liked Blake. 

MICHELLE	He’s like one of those good guys. He’ll be back.

SARAH	Sometimes I feel like I’m pushing him, and maybe this isn’t…

TAYLOR	I’m just going to call it how it is. 

TAYLOR	You need to toss that boy out like a used tampon. 

CARRIE	Ew, what is wrong with you?!

MICHELLE	Jesus, Taylor.

TAYLOR	I’m serious. You could do so much better than him. Blake is a fucking…

BLAKE	Cocksucker crusty dumb motherfucker!

SARAH	Blake?

SARAH	Blake, what… Are you okay?

BLAKE	I’m fine.

SARAH	What do you mean, “fine?” What does “fine” mean? 

SARAH	Where have you been?

BLAKE	 Get out here, you fucking piece of shit!

RANDY	Come out, come out, wherever you are! Warriors! Huh?

BLAKE	You got me fucking arrested!

RANDY	 No, you got you arrested.

SARAH	Arrested?

RANDY	Yes.

BLAKE	I’ll explain in a second.

RANDY	If you think about it, Blake…

RANDY	none of this shit is actually my fault.

BLAKE	What are you talking about, you fucking psycho? 

BLAKE	You burned down my gazebo!

RANDY	 No, no, no.

SARAH	What? Were you…Were you partying with Randy?

RANDY	Yes. He was getting fucking wasted.

BLAKE	 No. No.

BLAKE/RANDY	Shut the fuck up. 

BLAKE	 No, I was not. I was… I was not!

RANDY	Really? Bullshit! Fucking loser. Zero.

BLAKE	He’s lying. That’s not true. I was not.

RANDY	 Oh, really? Oh, was it?

BLAKE	I can honestly say I wasn’t fucking partying with you. Yeah.

RANDY	Oh, you’re fucking done now, dude.

RANDY	Look at that. Huh?

BLAKE	I am the God of cock fire!

RANDY	Who’s that? Who’s that, Blake? Jesus Christ? That’s you.

TAYLOR	Oh, my fucking God.

BLAKE	That’s being shown out of context. Sarah.

RANDY	How is it taken out of content? Tell them.

BLAKE	It’s not like that. I got a little drunk.

MICHELLE	God, Let’s back… Let’s calm…

SARAH	 Just stop! Just stop, just stop talking.

TAYLOR	Done. Done, done, done.

RANDY	Look. 

SARAH	I can’t… I can’t do this!

RANDY	It looks like you have a lot more to worry about than me, motherfucker, huh?

RANDY	Princess Sarah is pissed.

RANDY	Which means you ain’t getting no pussy tonight.

BLAKE	Shut the fuck up, all right? 

RANDY	No fucking pussy.

BLAKE	We just wanted a house!

BLAKE	And we went and looked at 17 houses…

BLAKE	and we found this one, and finally Sarah was happy…

BLAKE	and so was I, and then fucking… you!

RANDY	Well, I guess you’re not my friend.

RANDY	You’re not my friend, you’re not my friend, dude. 

BLAKE	Shut the fuck up!

BLAKE	Oh, my God.

RANDY	 Yeah. Yeah.

OFFICER FORD 	You know what underage drinking…

OFFICER FORD	and assault and battery have in common, Renner?!

RANDY	They’re both illegal. Illegal!

OFFICER FORD	 That’s right! You know what?!

OFFICER FORD	- Hey! Are you okay?

BLAKE	 Oh, my God.

RANDY	No.

OFFICER FORD	 I can’t believe you hit Randy.

BLAKE	He drugged me!

OFFICER FORD 	You know what?Apologize to Randy.

RANDY	Yeah.

OFFICER FORD	 Apologize!

BLAK	I will not apologize.

RANDY	 Tell him to kiss me.

OFFICER FORD 	Yeah, kiss Randy.

OFFICER FORD	Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead!

OFFICER FORD 	What the fuck? You’re going to kiss him?!

BLAKE	I don’t know!

OFFICER FORD	 You’re a piece of shit, man!

RANDY	He was going to kiss me, you piece of shit!

OFFICER FORD 	I can’t believe this.

OFFICER FORD 	I’m back here again with you trust fund kids.

BLAKE	I’m not a trust fund kid.

OFFICER FORD	 Yeah, like you can afford this.

OFFICER FORD	 Just sit there and shut the fuck up!

RANDY	 Thank you.

OFFICER FORD	Oh, my God. I’m so sorry, Randy.

RANDY	My head hurts.

OFFICER FORD	Did he hit you good?

RANDY	Yeah, he punched me under there…

RANDY	and I was on my dating app, Chubby Chasers. 

RANDY	I was looking for some babes, and this fucking--

OFFICER FORD	I’m on Chubby Chaser. 

OFFICER FORD	No. really?

OFFICER FORD	I love big bitches, man!

RANDY	 Oh, my God. 

OFFICER FORD	Have you…Have you met anybody?

BLAKE	Can we go?

OFFICER FORD	 Hey! Hey! 

RANDY	Yeah, yeah, yeah.

OFFICER FORD	Hey! I’m the captain now!

OFFICER FORD	We should watch that. Movie night!
RANDY	 Yeah. 

OFFICER FORD	All right, Randy.

RANDY	Thank you, officer.

BLAKE	This is war.

RANDY	Carl… Take care.

OFFICER FORD	Shut…your…

OFFICER FORD	fucking face, okay?

BLAKE 	Okay. Right. Yeah.

OFFICER FORD	Just sit back and shut up!

OFFICER FORD	I know your type! I fucking hate you!

OFFICER FORD	Damn it! I gotta take this motherfucking… 

OFFICER FORD 	You’re lucky I didn’t get this out.

BLAKE	Yeah.

OFFICER FORD	I’ll beat your ass with this.

SERGEANT WINTERS	Well, here’s your belongings.

SERGEANT WINTERS	I need you to sign right here.

SERGEANT WINTERS	When can we expect to see you again? 

BLAKE	Never again.

SERGEANT WINTERS	Fantastic.

SERGEANT WINTERS	We’ll keep the same room for you.

SERGEANT WINTERS	I’ll get you a good roommate. Really nice. 

BLAKE	Okay, all right. Terrific.

BLAKE	 Look, I’m really sorry about all this dumb shit.

BLAKE	 Lying to you, partying, Randy.

SARAH	 Look, Blake. It’s not about Randy. It’s about you and your behavior. 

SARAH	This really has got to stop.

BLAKE	I know.

OFFICER FORD 	Well, well, well. We meet again, Mr. Renner.

BLAKE	Look, I’m just getting out right now. 

OFFICER FORD	It’s you again.

BLAKE	So if you’ll just let us go…

OFFICER FORD 	I’m actually here to serve you with a restraining order…

OFFICER FORD 	on behalf of one Mr. Randy Cockfield.

SARAH	That’s got to be a mistake.

SARAH	I mean, it’s our house. 

SARAH	We paid for it. We don’t even have a lease with him on it.

OFFICER FORD	Ma’am, I understand that, but this is about Mr. Renner’s assault…

OFFICER FORD	his temper, his anger issues.
BLAK	This has to be a joke. 

OFFICER FORD	It’s no joke here, okay?

OFFICER FORD 	You are no longer allowed to be within 100 feet of Mr. Cockfield.

OFFICER FORD 	You may not contact him verbally or by the internet.

BLAKE	Is that, I mean, is there anything we can do?

OFFICER FORD 	You can contact the city, but the laws for tenants are pretty strict.

BLAKE	He’s not a tenant! He’s a squatter! 

BLAKE	And how am I supposed to keep 100 feet away from him in my own house?

OFFICER FORD 	Good luck. Bye.

SERGEANT WINTERS	Goodbye.

OFFICER FORD	Sergeant.

SERGEANT WINTERS	Goodbye. 

BLAKE	Why is everyone here like this?

SARAH	 Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You’re fucked.

BLAKE	It is so on, you bitch!

RANDY	Blake, I thought you were my friend, but I guess not.

BLAKE	What did you say?

RANDY	I said, you…

RANDY	have skinny, bony bitches.

BLAKE	That’s it. That’s all from me.

BLAKE	I just want to stand and stare tonight!

RANDY	Yeah, well go back inside you little-- 

RANDY	Hey! 

BLAKE	 I interrupted the whole flow!

RANDY	I can’t believe I let you come here and suck my dick pipe!

BLAKE	That dick pipe is a gross exaggeration of what you’re working with, my man.

RANDY	Yeah, what the fuck ever, you little waspy bitch, you know?

RANDY	You stay on your side, and I’ll stay on my side. Warriors!

RANDY	Come out and play, yay.

BLAKE	They’re all my side!

RANDY	Good night.

BLAKE	Good night!

RANDY	Go back to Marin County!

BLAKE	No. I’m kicking him out. This is war.

SARAH	Don’t start this. I can’t handle the stress.

BLAKE	What, let him walk all over us? No fucking way.

SARAH	I’m serious. I don’t like this side of you.

BLAKE	Well, you haven’t seen anything yet. Thank you very much.

SARAH	What are you doing?

RANDY	Why did the power go off? What’s he going do without power?

SARAH	I don’t like this.

BLAKE	Come on. What?

BLAKE	No one says I have to pay for his electricity.

BLAKE	He’s fucked. 

BLAKE	What the fuck is that? Is sounds like a helicopter’s out there.

RANDY	Cutting off the power’s amateur hour, huh?

BLAKE	I fucking hate this guy.

RANDY	I’m too powerful for you, bro. Too motherfucking strong.

RANDY	Look at that shit. 

RANDY	This is my side, that’s your side. You stay over there, little pussy.

RANDY	Whose got some beer, huh?

RANDY	Hey, Benny!

RANDY	Randy can wobble, but he can’t what?

RANDY	He can’t fall down!

BENNY	That’s fantastic, bro.Hey, can I leave?

BLAKE	Now we could have the rehearsal dinner back here. 

BLAKE	I’ll fix up the gazebo and we could have the wedding back here…

BLAKE	all while that fucker’s not around to mess with us. 

SARAH	Oh.

BLAKE	I’m going to have my gravy!

SARAH	I love you!

BLAKE	I love you too! I honestly love you so much!

BLAKE	Oh, yeah, I think that’s the time.

SARAH	Yeah. Okay.

SARAH	So before we dig into dessert…

SARAH	we just wanted to say a big thank you to our amazing wedding party.

BLAKE	All you guys.

SARAH	 All your love and support.

SARAH	Well, the last couple of weeks have been a bit of a journey getting here, but--

BLAKE	It’s been a little rocky, but it’s been good.

SARAH	Yeah.

BLAKE	Yeah.

SARAH	But tonight is really just about celebrating…

SARAH	and making memories, and spreading love. 

ALL	Cheers!

BLAKE	Cheers, you guys. Thank you so much. Cheers, you guys.

BLAKE	Enjoy the cake.

PYRO-PETE	Weddings are the worst. 

PYRO-PETE	I’m sure your wedding’s going to be fine, but I hate weddings.

BLAKE	Yeah.

PYRO-PETE	 I’m going to go to yours, man…

PYRO-PETE	but it’ll be all right.

BLAKE	I appreciate that. I appreciate… 

BLAKE	Mainly it’s her dad. What’s the word? 

BLAKE	Like, he hates me. He hates me a ton.

SARAH	Okay, Blake’s exaggerating. 

SARAH	He doesn’t hate you. He just…

SARAH	He’s not too sure about you.

CARRIE	Oh, come on. Who could hate those sad goat eyes?

KIP WERNER	Yeah, Sarah’s dad isn’t so bad.

KIP WERNER	Loved me, right, Sarah?

SARAH	Kip, he did.

BLAKE	Yeah, he really loves you a ton.

THADIUS BAKER	Good old Douglas, man. 

THADIUS BAKER	He’s crazy. I love that dude.

KIP WERNER 	Remember when he took us to the beach house?

SARAH	Oh, the beach house!

THADIUS	Oh, man.

BLAKE	That sounds awesome.

BLAKE	 That sounds really awesome, the beach house.

KIP WERNER	That was awesome.

BLAKE	I’ve seen pictures, but I’ve never been.

KIP WERNER	 Yeah.

BLAKE	Yeah, the very second he met me…

BLAKE	he called me Kip, then he said, “Never mind…” 

BLAKE	and then he said, “I hate you.”

RANDY	You mother fucking cock.

RANDY	Fucking flakka possum.

SARAH	What the fuck?! What the fuck?!

DOCTOR MITCHELL	Well, that’s the last of the shots. 

DOCTOR MITCHELL	With any luck, you guys will all be fine.

DOCTOR MITCHELL	Except him. He’s not going anywhere.

THADIUS BAKER	Aw, man. This is bullshit.

DOCTOR MITCHELL	It is.

DOCTOR MITCHELL	You know, you did the right thing coming in as fast as you did.

DOCTOR MITCHELL	Rabies is not something to be taken lightly.

DOCTOR MITCHELL	May I ask you a fairly serious question?

SARAH	Oh, of course.

DOCTOR MITCHELL	What the fuck was that thing?

DOCTOR MITCHELL	God damn, you guys got fucked up.

BLAKE	I’m sorry, wait. Did you say we have a “decent chance of being okay…” 

BLAKE	as in it’s not…it’s not a good chance?

DOCTOR MITCHELL	The medicine usually works.

SARAH	What do you mean, “usually?”

SARAH	What if the medicine doesn’t work?

DOCTOR MITCHELL	Well, then you’re fucked. Basically.

BLAKE	Fucking flakka possum.

SARAH	Everybody else got the rabies shots already. 

SARAH	Do you think we should tell them that it may not work?

BLAKE	You mean keep it from them for a little bit?

BLAKE	Oh.

OFFICER FORD	Mr. Renner, what exactly did this to your guests?

BLAKE	Nothing. I have no idea. It could’ve been absolutely anything.

OFFICER FORD	Yeah. Mr. Renner… 

OFFICER FORD	I’d advise you not to take the law into your own hands.

BLAKE	Of course not. Because that would be illegal.

SARAH	Very illegal.

OFFICER FORD	Okay, Bonnie and Clyde. You have a good evening.

SARAH	Will do. Thank you so much for stopping by. 

BLAKE	o good to see you.

OFFICER FORD	 Oh, I hate you both.

SARAH	I think we’ve got to postpone the wedding.

BLAKE	No. What? No, no, no. 

BLAKE	He knows that he went too far with all of this shit. 

BLAKE	Now he’ll lie low. He’ll be too scared to do anything. 

BLAKE	The wedding is still on.

SARAH	I mean…

BLAKE	The wedding is still on. It’s 100% on.

SARAH	Are you sure?

BLAKE	 Yes, I’m sure. I love you.

SARAH	I love you.

SARAH	I think he’s going to die.

BLAKE	I know.

SARAH	Daddy.

DOUGLAS	I will give you $100,000 if we turn around right now.

SARAH	We already talked about this.

DOUGLAS	All right.

BLAKE	Good to see you.

FATHER JEFF	We are gathered here today in the presence of God…

FATHER JEFF	to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.

FATHER JEFF	To bind their hearts as one forever and ever.

FATHER JEFF	And ever. 

FATHER JEFF	Ever.

FATHER JEFF	 To bind their love as one.

KIP WERNER	What’s that, sir?

DOUGLAS	A mint. Do you have a…

DOUGLAS	You don’t have to call me sir.

FATHER JEFF	And what is love?

FATHER JEFF	 Love is kind. Love is patient.

KIP WERNER	I can get you

DOUGLAS	I wish…I wish you would call me dad. 

FATHER JEFF	Walk away. Walk away right now. End this shit.

BLAKE	What?

FATHER JEFF	 End this fucking madness.

BLAKE	What?

FATHER JEFF	You don’t need this.

BLAKE	What?

FATHER JEFF	 Just end this.

SARAH	Dude. Seriously?

FATHER JEFF	The ring.

BLAKE	Oh. Thanks, bud.

FATHER JEFF	Blake!

BLAKE	Jeez…

FATHER JEFF	 Do you take Sar-ee-yah…

BLAKE	Sarah.

SARAH	It’s Sarah.

FATHER JEFF	 Whatever.

FATHER JEFF	 As your life? Wife?

BLAKE	Yes. I do. 

FATHER JEFF	Do you take…

FATHER JEFF	 Blame…

BLAKE	Blake.

FATHER JEFF	Yeah.

SARAH	It’s Blake.

FATHER JEFF	Do you take this guy to be your husband?

SARAH	Yes. I do.

FATHER JEFF	And now by the power vested in this state and this country…

FATHER JEFF	I now pronounce you husband and wife.

FATHER JEFF	You may kiss the bride. Or whatever.

FATHER JEFF	Good luck.

FATHER JEFF	May God have mercy on your souls!

MUD YODEL	Well, man, you finally did it. Proud of you.

BLAKE	Thank you.

MUD YODEL	Took one for the team.

PYRO-PETE	Your life is completely over. ’m so proud of you.

BLAKE	Thank you so much.

PYRO-PETE	You’re welcome.

MUD YODEL	Listen, if there’s ever a chance that you’re…

MUD YODEL	going to get anal, my friend, it’s tonight.

MUD YODEL	What’s up, Mr. M! How’s it going? Looking good, buddy.

MUD YODEL	Jason Statham good.

DOUGLAS	Stop talking. Get out of my airspace.

PYRO-PETE	Let’s go.

MUD YODEL	Unreal.

DOUGLAS	Blake.

BLAKE	Mr. Masters. Or I guess I should say, “Dad.”

DOUGLAS	Oh, you have surprised me.

DOUGLAS	And those who have tried will tell you it is not an easy thing to surprise…

DOUGLAS	Jesus! 

DOUGLAS	Angela, you should know better! Don’t ever sneak up! 

DOUGLAS	Never sneak up on a man! Me, especially! 

BLAKE	Whew.

DOUGLAS	She’s a wonderful woman. I knew her since… she was… 

DOUGLAS	She’s always been that tall, and she makes a great honey baked ham. 

DOUGLAS	Blake. Oh, God. Here’s the deal.

DOUGLAS	No one’s done it. You brought my daughter to the altar.

BLAKE	Yeah. Look, I want you to know, Sarah is my whole world.

BLAKE	All right? I know she’s too good for me.

BLAKE	I do. No, I really do, but her happiness is the most…

BLAKE	important thing in the world to me.

DOUGLAS	Well, that’s one thing we have in common. 

SARAH	Daddy!

DOUGLAS	Yeah? Yes?

SARAH	Blake, we just… We need you for some photos. 

BLAKE	 I’ll be there in a sec.

KIP WERNER	Mr. D!

DOUGLAS	Kip!

DOUGLAS	Ladies and gentlemen… 

DOUGLAS	Would you join me, please, in raising a…

DOUGLAS	glass to my lovely daughter and her new…

DOUGLAS	lovely husband. 

DOUGLAS	Sweet pea… my heart…

DOUGLAS	I wish you the kind of passion that your mother and I…

DOUGLAS	have shared for the last 35 years.

BEVERLY	Stop. 

DOUGLAS	Not a day goes by that I do not look across the room and… 

DOUGLAS	and wonder how… how am I so lucky?

DOUGLAS	Things I’ve done, I’ll tell you, though…

DOUGLAS	it sounds fun, waterboarding. Not a water sport. 

DOUGLAS	But this lady makes everything okay, because she’s so beautiful.

DOUGLAS	So classy. 

DOUGLAS	So attentive, I guess. 

DOUGLAS	Honey. What are you…? Bev, what are you…?

BEVERLY	Raise your glass! 

BEVERLY	You tux is fantastic.

KIP WERNER	Hey, Douglas. What’s Bev been drinking?

KIP WERNER	I’ll have a double.

BEVERLY	Oh!

DOUGLAS	Yeah, and I’ll pour it for you a little bit later.

DOUGLAS	You want to go and lay down?

BEVERLY	He’s cute!

DOUGLAS	Come on. Are you okay?

BEVERLY	I want to go suck your cock. 

DOUGLAS	You want to… what?

BEVERLY	Everybody! I want to suck his cock!

BEVERLY	Raise your glasses, everyone!

BEVERLY	To sucking cock!

SARAH	What the actual fuck?

MUD YODEL	I think your mom’s on molly. That’s what the actual fuck.

PYRO-PETE	That’s really nice. What is this?

MUD YODEL	What the hell’s wrong with you?

PYRO-PETE	It’s soft.

MUD YODEL	Stop. Stop. Get out of here.

ARAH	Blake, all of our guests are acting really weird.

BLAKE	No. They’re just drunk. It’s a wedding.

SARAH	No, no. This is beyond drunk.

BLAKE	Cousin Jimmy! What the fuck!?

SARAH	Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

KIP WERNER	Please! No! Oh, my God! 

CARRIE	Have you seen my friends? 

CARRIE	I am so happy you’re not my dad.

MAN #4	What the fuck is going on?!

SARAH	They’re out of control! The house is ruined, the wedding’s ruined.

BLAKE	He’s here. I know he’s here somewhere.

BLAKE	This has Randy written all over it.

RANDY	Hey, yeah! Whoa!

RANDY	Fuck! Shit. 

RANDY	Oopsies! Oh, man.

RANDY	Holy shit. What the fuck? 

BLAKE	What the fuck did you do, Randy?

RANDY	I gave your party the whole box, brother. 

RANDY	I gave them the whole motherfucking box!

BLAKE	I’m gonna fucking kill you!

RANDY	Oh, shit.

SARAH	 Daddy, I’m so sorry.

DOUGLAS	It’s all right.

DOUGLAS	It’ll be fine. It’s all over now. 

DOUGLAS	Nearly… over. 

DOUGLAS	Go ahead. Look up. 

DOUGLAS	Christ.

RANDY	Man. If that shit was on Pay-Per-View…

RANDY	we’d be fucking millionaires right now, for real.

BLAKE	Shut the fuck up! You never shut the fuck up!

RANDY	I was trying to be your friend, okay?

RANDY	I was being nice to you and being generous, and you were miserable.

BLAKE	Oh, my God! Of course I was miserable, all right? 

BLAKE	That’s what growing up is! You’re just, you’re miserable!

BLAKE	And you look for someone you can try to enjoy the misery with…

BLAKE	and that’s what Sarah is.

BLAKE	Okay? And then I fucked it all up for no reason! 

BLAKE	For you! For fucking around with you! It’s insane!

RANDY	Yeah, well, the Sarah thing will pass, okay? 

RANDY	I’m more concerned about us and our relationship, okay?

RANDY	So what we need to do as a, as a team, bro, as a team--

BLAKE	Do not fucking touch me!

RANDY	We need to move forward.

BLAKE	Don’t touch me!

RANDY	We should move forward--

BLAKE	There is no moving forward!

RANDY	And not look in the rearview mirror.

BLAKE	There’s not a rearview mirror!

RANDY	Yes, there is.

BLAKE	There is not a fucking rearview mirror!

RANDY	What do you mean?

BLAKE	You’re a fucking loser!

RANDY	Let’s cruise.

BLAKE	You’re a loser, dude. All right?

RANDY	You’re fucked, dude. 

BLAKE	You’re 50 years old and you live in a fucking guest house!

RANDY	Whatever. Whatever. Dude.

BLAKE	You are fucking delusional, man. Everything around you turns to shit.

OFFICER FORD	Mr. Renner… Visitor.

OFFICER FORD	Ma’am.

BLAKE	Hey. Are you okay?

SARAH	Just stop. I came to pay your bail.

BLAKE	Okay.

RANDY	What about my bail? Please? 

SARAH	No. I’m not paying your fucking bail.

SARAH	Okay, I came to pay your bail. I paid your bail, and that’s it.

BLAKE	What do you mean? 

SARAH	I mean… 

SARAH	I mean that’s it. You and me. 

SARAH	We’re done. I can’t do this.

BLAKE	Sarah. Listen.

BLAKE	That’s… No, no.
 
SARAH	How many more signs do we need, you know? 

SARAH	If it wasn’t this, it’d be something in one, two, five years from now.

BLAKE	Listen to me. I… that’s not… We can

SARAH	Look, I am listening. I’m finally listening to you.
 
BLAKE	But don’t you love me?

SARAH	Love isn’t the issue here.

BLAKE	Yes, it is. It’s the only issue.

SARAH	Blake, I can’t. Just please, just don’t make this any worse.

OFFICER FORD	Yeah.

BLAKE	Wait.

BLAKE	Just give me another chance.

SARAH	I’m pregnant.

BLAKE	Okay. That’s fine. That’s great. I mean …

BLAKE	now the plan is you get me out of here, and we

SARAH	No! No. The plan is I’m going to stay at my parents’ house…

SARAH	and do not come and try to see me…

SARAH	because my dad said he’s going to kill you…

SARAH	and I really think he means it this time. 

SARAH	I gotta go.

OFFICER FORD	Wow.

RANDY	Wow.

RANDY	She’s pregnant, man. That’s amazing.

BLAKE	 Shut the fuck up.

RANDY	I just think that--

BLAKE	Shut the…You have to shut the fuck up.

RANDY	Gotcha.

OFFICER FORD	 Sad.

BLAKE	Okay.

OFFICER FORD	 Sarge!

OFFICER FORD	Get in here. This is him.

RANDY	What’s up? What’s up? Are you…

OFFICER FORD	This is Cockfield!

RANDY	Yeah.

SERGEANT WINTERS	This is the guy you told me about?

RANDY	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi. Hi. My name is Randy…

RANDY	Randy. Officer…?

SERGEANT WINTERS	No, call me Jim.

RANDY	Oh! Hey. 

RANDY	You told him about me.

OFFICER FORD	Yeah.

TAYLOR	Oh, my God. He is so cute.

SARAH	don’t want to do this on my own.

TAYLOR	You are not on your own.

BLAKE	Hello?

EDNA	 Hey, Blake.

EDNA	It’s Edna from Hindpoken Realty.

SARAH	Hello, Edna.

EDNA	I just need to go over a few things in person…

EDNA	before we put the house back on the market. 

EDNA	Can you meet me at the house Saturday at noon?

BLAKE	Great. Thanks, Edna.

EDNA	I’ll see you Saturday!

SARAH	Okay, see you then.

BLAKE	Jesus.

SARAH	Blake?

BLAKE	Hi. Sarah.

BLAKE	You…You, you look amazing.

SARAH	Blake, I wasn’t expecting…
BLAKE	No, I wasn’t either. 

BLAKE	Edna called me and said I should stop by today. 

SARAH	Yeah, me too.

SARAH	The house looks amazing. You’ve been busy.

BLAKE	No. No, I didn’t…I didn’t do any of this.

SARAH	What? Who did?

RANDY	Truce, truce. Peace, peace. Truce, truce.

BLAKE	Are you fucking kidding me?

RANDY	Look, look, look. 

RANDY	Just give me five minutes of your time. Just five minutes and I’ll be gone.

RANDY	You’ll never see my face again. I promise. Please.

BLAKE	I’ll give you 30 seconds, you fucking asshole.

RANDY	Look, it’s really important to me that a family lives in this house. 

RANDY	Not me, not anyone else, but a family.

RANDY	And I want it to be your family, so you guys, please, just…

RANDY	just don’t put the house on the market just yet. Please.

SARAH	You did this? How?

RANDY	I sold Napoleon’s hat.

BLAKE	A Napoleon hat paid for all this?

RANDY	No.

RANDY	Not a napoleon’s hat, fucking Napoleon’s hat, dude.

SARAH	I don’t understand.

RANDY	No, that stuff in the cardboard boxes…

RANDY	in the back, okay, that was dad’s stuff. It was my inheritance. 

RANDY	I found out it was worth millions. 

RANDY	Dude, I’m a fucking millionaire on top of it. 

RANDY	Slum dude millionaire, bro. It’s fucking weird.

BLAKE	Congrats. That’s awesome. Okay.

RANDY	I’m a fucking millionaire.

BLAKE	Yeah, that’s really cool.

SARAH	That’s great.

RANDY	Listen, and there’s just…

RANDY	Man. There’s just one more thing that I got to tell you guys that… 

RANDY	I’ve been keeping from you guys for quite some time. 

BLAKE	What is it?

RANDY	The main reason why…

RANDY	I didn’t want to get rid of this house and let it go is because this…

RANDY	This is my family’s house. My childhood home. 
RANDY	I actually grew up here my whole life. 

RANDY	When my parents both died, they left it to me.

RANDY	So I just moved into the guest house and…

RANDY	I had no other plan but to stall the sale. 

RANDY	So when you guys came around, I just, I fucking freaked out, man.

BLAKE	Yeah. Yeah, you really did.

RANDY	All right? But I’m ready to let it go…

RANDY	okay, and just give you guys my house to start a family here. 

RANDY	Your family. For reals.

RANDY	You’re my friend, dudes. You guys are my friend, dudes.

RANDY	Please.

RANDY	And I have one other thing that I want to show you guys.

RANDY	Just one other thing.

BLAKE	Is it going to be gross?

RANDY	No, come here.

SARAH	Oh, God.

BLAKE	Oh! Oh, my God.

BLAKE	I don’t even know what to say.

RANDY	Well, this is it, guys. This is where you’re going to…

RANDY	start your new life, in Randy Cockfield’s childhood home.

 RANDY	And Blake… 

RANDY	When you bring Sarah into the field, what are you going to do with her?

RANDY	What are you going to do with her, man?

BLAKE	Don’t. 

RANDY	Come on, say it.

BLAKE	Don’t spoil it.

RANDY	Say it.

RANDY	Give me his cock!

BLAKE	That’s right. Yeah.

RANDY	Is this beautiful or what, guys? I mean, come on.

RANDY	All right, man. 

BLAKE	Thanks, man.

RANDY	Sarah.

SARAH	 Thank you. Yeah.

BLAKE	All right, too long on the hug. Too long.

SARAH	Okay. Thank you. No, no, no.

BLAKE	No.

SARAH	Okay. 

BLAKE	Great. 

BLAKE	And just like that, he’s gone.

SARAH	Here you go

SARAH	ere’s a cracker. Yum.

SARAH	You got little dinosaurs. Look at the little dinosaur. 

SARAH	Do you want to be a dinosaur? Yeah.

BLAKE	Hey. Got an email from Randy. Signed it, “Admiral Cockfield…”

BLAKE	which I actually think works more than Randy.

SARAH	I wonder where he is. 

SARAH	Wait, do I want to know?

BLAKE	Well, he sent a link. Do you want to watch it?

BLAKE	Fuck it. I’m clicking it. Cover him up.

RANDY	Yo, what’s up, Blake and Sarah?

RANDY	I want to let you know that I’m living my life. 

RANDY	It’s Randy Cockfield. I miss you guys. 

RANDY	I bought a boat. I’m sailing the seven seas, dudes! 

OFFICER FORD	Illegal, Renner! Illegal!

REGGIE	Oh, you’re missing out, Blakey.

REGGIE	Ooh, I like this. Ooh, ooh!

RANDY	And look who else is here! It’s our fuzzy buddy.

RANDY	Oh! He misses you, dude! 

RANDY	I’m going to come visit you guys in a couple weeks…

RANDY	so just have the guest house ready for me.

SARAH	Fuck that shit. No, he’s not.

BLAKE	No, he’s not coming here.
