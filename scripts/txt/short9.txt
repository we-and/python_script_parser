THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	You don’t have to like the same things to be friends

THOMAS	The first time Philip met Toby he was really excited! Philip thought Toby was a box cab like him.

THOMAS	...And because he looked like Toby, Philip was sure Toby would be his friend and would love doing all the same things he did.

THOMAS	Philip challenged Toby to a race. But Toby didn't want to race, he didn't like racing. But this made him think Toby didn't like him!

THOMAS	I told Philip that just because Toby didn't like to race, that didn't mean they couldn't be friends.

THOMAS	I told him that Toby liked traveling slowly and quietly through the countryside. Philip thought he might like that too. And he did. Well sort of! (laugh).

THOMAS	That’s why you don’t have to like the same things to be friends!
