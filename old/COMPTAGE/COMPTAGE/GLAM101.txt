(Glammys School Of Fashion vlog - EPS 101)

REBECCA	Hi! My name is Rebecca, and this is my new school. Isn’t it beautiful? To be eligible, you have to have a talent for fashion, creativity, and (ahem) be classy… Although sometimes I can be a little impulsive.. But why not? Am I going to just stay quiet?

VAN_LINDEN	This is the “Super-Sewing-Mega-Size-Unstitch_Robot.” The Rolls Royce of sewing machines and it’s very difficult to use.

REBECCA	(Pfft) It seems super easy to me.

VAN_LINDEN	You think so? 

CRYSTAL	(Giggle)

ELECTRA	(Giggle)

REBECCA	Ehm...I could make a dress..

VAN_LINDEN	Really? Then tell me, when can you do it. And how soon?

REBECCA	For, for… for tomorrow?

CARMEN	But are you sure you can in 12 hours? You aren’t exaggerating? 


REBECCA	While I was working, my friends sent me photos they posted from a party.

FEMALE FRIEND	But what do you need to finish it? Stop working, and come dance!

FEMALE FRIEND_2	Hey! We’re having a lot of fun. Come to the party?

REBECCA	Even though things weren’t going my way... I didn’t lose my cool...

REBECCA	Stop, I’m gonna show you.

REBECCA	In the end, there was no more fabric to sew with ... except for the shower curtain.

CARMEN	Rebecca?

CARMEN	Rebecca? What happened here?

REBECCA	But then I asked myself, “Who would wear a dress made of plastic to walk around in?

REBECCA	And so I threw it out.

VAN_LINDEN	So, your “Dress in under 12 hours,” where might it be?

CRYSTAL	(Giggle)

ELECTRA	(Giggle)

CARMEN	Sorry for the delay. I brought the raincoat, Rebecca.

REBECCA	Wow! My sample dress/dress model was a rain coat. It wasn’t weird. It was beautiful, a bit futuristic, but super funky! Incredible. Van Linden also liked it.

REBECCA	Hard work and friendship saved the day. Well, I have to go. More soon from Vlog School of Fashion!

CARMEN	Ciao!
