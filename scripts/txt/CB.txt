INTERVIEWER	Two minutes?

MCQUEEN	We ready?

INTERVIEWER	Another minute, Mr. McQueen.

INTERVIEWER	Can you talk a little about your time in Arizona?

MCQUEEN	We're rolling?

CAMERA TECH	Sorry, Mr. McQueen.

MCQUEEN	Come on, guys.

INTERVIEWER	Sorry, we're rolling. Just talk a little about choosing Prescott.

MCQUEEN	Arizona is great. Nice people. Real nice. Genuine, you know? Very hospitable. Frontier Days is a real gas.

MCQUEEN	When approaching this story, it was important that we focus on the realism. Realism is very important.

INTERVIEWER	Having recently come off a difficult shoot, it must be nice to now be closer to home, to family.

MCQUEEN	Yeah, well, France was a challenge, we always knew it would be.

INTERVIEWER	I think it's safe to say that at this point in your career your fans know you have a true passion for racing, for what you drive. Talk a little about what drives you.

MCQUEEN	Come again?

INTERVIEWER	What would you say drives you?

MCQUEEN	Damn, Freddie, seeing you out here is like seeing a fish ride a bicycle. What are you doing here?

FREDDIE	We got real issues, Steve.

MCQUEEN	How'd you find me?

FREDDIE	How's that even important right now?

MCQUEEN	It's important to me.

FREDDIE	Who cares? I'm here and we got issues.

MCQUEEN	Stop leaning.

FREDDIE	Leaning?

MCQUEEN	On the car. You're leaning on the car.

FREDDIE	Christ, Steve. Listen to me. We need to talk about France.

MCQUEEN	What about it?

FREDDIE	Word's out. The talk's all over town. It's not good. 

MCQUEEN	Not my problem anymore. I'm done.

FREDDIE	Maybe when your name is Joe Schmoe from Buttonwillow. Not when your name is Steve  fucking McQueen. The Cinema Center reps are not happy,  Steve.

MCQUEEN	So what's the brass tax?

FREDDIE	They want you to do press.

MCQUEEN	No.

FREDDIE	Steve

MCQUEEN	The point was to make a good film. A real film.

FREDDIE	People like a story, Steve. They like characters. You were shooting a two-hour documentary about a car race that nobody in America cares about.

MCQUEEN	We'd a-made eem care.

FREDDIE	The suits thought different.

MCQUEEN	I'm done with it.

FREDDIE	Fine. I'll go back to Rosen with that. But, it's not going to go down well. And it still doesn't change where we are now. We need to do some damage control.

MCQUEN	Damage control?

FREDDIE	Bill called me.

MCQUEEN	Aw, son of a bitch.

FREDDIE	We're your team, Steve. We have to communicate or this doesn't work. Let us do our job. We're not the enemy. It's time to go to work. You need to chose your next project carefully.

MCQUEEN	I'm doing On Any Sunday with Bruce.

FREDDIE	The motorcycle thing? No, that's a vacation. You need a paycheck. I might have some endorsements lined up. Strictly overseas. But our top priority has to be your next acting gig. Something that puts you back on top. Have you thought about what I told you about First Artists?

MCQUEEN	Just join the club, huh?

FREDDIE	It's a good deal.

MCQUEEN	What's Newman doing?

FREDDIE	For First Artists? Pocket Money. You're already attached to the pick of the litter right now. The Getaway, Junior Bonner and that French prison thing. Just pick.

MCQUEEN	Just pick, huh?

FREDDIE	Yeah.

MCQUEEN	Just pick.

FREDDIE	Yes, Steve. Pick. For Christ's sakes, I came all the way out to bumble fuck here to tell you things are bad. You're hemorrhaging money and you burned every goddamn bridge back in France.

MCQUEEN	You know what's really chapping my hide, Freddie? This car.

FREDDIE	Who cares? They come and go with you, Steve.

MCQUEEN	Warner Brothers gave it to me, a gift.

FREDDIE	It's a beauty.

MCQUEEN	Yeah, there's just one problem. What's the problem, Haig?

HAIG	It's not the car.

MCQUEEN	It's not the car.

FREDDIE	What car?

MCQUEEN	The... car.

FREDDIE	Aw, Christ.

MCQUEEN	Look, this a pacifer, an imposter. The car was a GT .

HAIG	 horsepower, foot pounds of torque, a real power plant.

MCQUEEN	Had a -speed manual transmission, too. What else, Haig?

HAIG	Dark Highland green.

MCQUEEN	Dark Highland green.

FREDDIE	Who cares?

MCQUEEN	Are you blind?

HAIG	Listen, this is a '  Boss prototype. It's no GT .

MCQUEEN	It's a fucking automatic. Find me the car, Freddie.

FREDDIE	We don't have time for this, Steve.

HAIG	It's all set, Steve.

MCQUEEN	Thanks, buddy. That's it, you find me the car, I'll pick my next project.

FREDDIE	That's gonna be impossible.

MCQUEEN	I need it, Freddie. Blink if it's a yes. Good. Sundown oughtta do it. You're a standup guy, Freddie. I'll call to check in. A two hour documentary about a car race that nobody in America cares about?

FREDDIE	Their words.

MCQUEEN	You've seen Katzin's cut? Most of John's stuff is out. Too bad.

FREDDIE	Be reasonable, Steve.

MCQUEEN	Freddie, I hired you to be a barracuda. Are you a barracuda?

FREDDIE	I'm a barracuda.

MCQUEEN	Right, find the car. Adios.

FREDDIE	Hey, wait! I took a goddamn cab here!

NEILE	How many is that?

MCQUEEN	See, this is what I'm talking about. You think I want to come home after ten, twelve hours and deal with this?

NEILE	It's a concern. It's about you thinking you can do whatever you want to do. How is that fair? How is that fair to me?

MCQUEEN	You know who you married.

NEILE	Oh, I know. Steve, this place, it's not good for you. It's too small. Just come home.

MCQUEEN	I can't, baby, not after what happened in France, what's been happening. I gotta get over this. I wanna come home, believe me, but I gotta get my head clear.

NEILE	We've both done things.

MCQUEEN	No, you did things. This is about what you did. Have the kids noticed?

NEILE	Chad is fine. I don't think he sees this as much different than you being on location.

MCQUEEN	Terry?

NEILE	She's sharp. She knows something's up, old soul.

NEILE	Have you seen a cut yet?

MCQUEEN	No.

NEILE	Soon maybe?

MCQUEEN	Sure, maybe. Suppose that's up to Bob Rosen.

NEILE	Well, no matter what they do, it's still your movie.

MCQUEEN	Oh, I guarantee whatever they do, it will not be my movie. Those jackals got a grip and started tearing away. Teeth biting right into it. There'll be nothing left but a carcass.

NEILE	You know, I think William Morris is going to be a good fit for you.

MCQUEEN	Yeah, Hilly thinks so.

NEILE	Well, Hilly knows his business. He's always been there for me.

MCQUEEN	This could be big for me, baby.

NEILE	So what is CBS saying about the spinoff?

MCQUEEN	Not sure yet. The producers really seemed to like me.

NEILE	Well, gotta wait it out.

NEILE	Have you been seeing the doctor?

MCQUEEN	Yes.

NEILE	Is there enough food here? I could have Ariel pick up some essentials.

MCQUEEN	I eat out.

NEILE	Just the thought of you here by yourself.

MCQUEEN	I'm a grown-ass man.

NEILE	I know.

MCQUEEN	You got plans later? Figure we could go to Chez Jay.

NEILE	I'm going to have a quiet night, I think.

MCQUEEN	Quiet night, huh?

NEILE	Yes, I'm going to head over to Ann's. Drink some wine. Girl time.

MCQUEEN	Girl time. What happens again at girl time?

NEILE	Just girl stuff, you know, chat, gossip.

MCQUEEN	Gossip.

NEILE	Chit-chat.

MCQUEEN	No, you said gossip.

NEILE	Figure of speech.

MCQUEEN	You talk about me?

NEILE	Sometimes, that's what girls do.

MCQUEEN	No, see, that's what the doctor is for. You tell the doctor something and he doesn't tell anyone else. He's a doctor. It's called confidentiality.

MCQUEEN	Ann, well, Ann, she's just a person. She can flap her gums all over town.

NEILE	She wouldn't do that.

MCQUEEN	Oh, no, not Ann, not dear, old Ann. I want to know what you and Ann talk about.

NEILE	Don't do this.

MCQUEEN	Let's play a game, like a scene study. I'll play Ann, okay, you ight have heard of me. You just... be yourself.

NEILE	I don't want to play.

MCQUEEN	Oh, but you will.

NEILE	Steve.

MCQUEEN	Tell me about him.

DOCTOR X	Tell me about you.

MCQUEEN	Not much to tell.

DOCTOR X	Certainly a man like you

MCQUEEN	A man like me?

DOCTOR X 	A man of your position.

MCQUEEN	My position.

DOCTOR X	Your stature. You're a movie star, Steve. Surely it comes with it's own set of... burdens?

DOCTOR X	This process only works if you talk to me, Steve.

MCQUEEN	Should I lay on the couch or something?

DOCTOR X	If you'd like.

MCQUEEN	Nah, I'm good.

DOCTOR X	All right, let's start from the beginning. Where were you born?

MCQUEEN	Beach Grove, Indiana, raised in Slater, Missouri.

DOCTOR X	Tell me about your parents?

MCQUEEN	Dead.

DOCTOR X	Who were they?

MCQUEEN	William and Julian McQueen.

DOCTOR X	Tell me about them.

MCQUEEN	This is ridiculous. I'm not paying you to sit here and talk about them. This is supposed to be about Neile and me. That's it.

DOCTOR X	Are you uncomfortable talking about your parents?

MCQUEEN	I'm just peachy. There is no other place I'd rather be right now.

DOCTOR X	What would you rather be doing?

DOCTOR X	Talk to me about your acting.

MCQUEEN	It can get a little candy-ass.

DOCTOR X	You must enjoy it, though.

MCQUEEN	I enjoy the bread.

DOCTOR X	How does it feel to be a movie star? The pressure to succeed. No privacy.

MCQUEEN	Look, Doc. I agreed to come here because I'm trying to save my marriage. My melon, I get it, it's twisted. It's just, these questions, I don't know what you're getting at.

DOCTOR X	We're trying to get to all of it, Steve. We start at the foundation.

MCQUEEN	What does my job have to do with it?

DOCTOR X	It's not just a job, Steve. You'd have to agree with that. It's the fame, the drugs, extramarital encounters. I mean, wouldn't you agree, it's not a normal job?

MCQUEEN	You're right, doc. When you're right, you're right. It's not a normal job. It's a fucking gas.

SULA	Well, I guess today is my lucky day. Steve McQueen.

MCQUEEN	Where you headed?

SULA	Steve McQueen.

MCQUEEN	That's me.

SULA	The girls back in Weedpatch would die. Which, actually, would be fine by me.

MCQUEEN	Weedpatch?

SULA	Weedpatch, California. Bakersfield?

MCQUEEN	Yeah.

SULA	Consider it the ass end.

MCQUEEN	You coming or going?

SULA	Oh, I'm going. I'm definitely  going. Weedpatch is no place for a girl like me.

MCQUEEN	A black girl?

SULA	Steve McQueen, a girl with talent.

MCQUEEN	So, what's your angle?

SULA	No angle, I'm a dancer. And when I say dancer, I don't mean Sunday come-to-meetin', cut a rug at the sock hop dancer. I'm a real dancer, Steve McQueen. I'll break your heart.

SULA	So, Steve McQueen, you coming or going?

MCQUEEN	Not important.

SULA	Something brought you out to the middle of nowhere.

MCQUEEN	You talk a lot.

SULA	Now you're starting to sound like my daddy.

MCQUEEN	Take your chances in Los Angeles, huh?

SULA	Oh, no. New York City, Broadway, baby. That's where the action is at.

MCQUEEN	Afraid I'm not going that far.

SULA	Well, that's understood.

MCQUEEN	Well, how far are we going?

SULA	We'll see how I enjoy the ride.

FREDDIE	Then put me on with someone at Warner Brothers who can. I need to find a clear bill of sale between the studio and whoever the fuck they sold the car to! Is it that hard? You know who you're talking to, right, okay. So, if this doesn't happen, I'm going to personally come down there, fire everyone and have 'em burned at the fucking stake!

SULA	Now this, this is a nice machine. You don't see too many of these in my neck of the woods. '?

MCQUEEN	You know your cars.

SULA	I know a lot of things.

MCQUEEN	Ya know, you're a groovy chick. You gotta cool vibe.

SULA	Now, do you talk like that because you want to talk like that or do you talk like that because you think you have to?

MCQUEEN	I'm beginning to see why Weedpatch couldn't hold you.

SULA	Weedpatch. Uncle took me to catch a Greyhound in Bakersfield. Broke down in Alameda. It was either the universe telling me to walk home or it was a challenge. I decided to say fuck you to the universe and keep walking.

MCQUEEN	Nothing does the job better than a good fuck you.

SULA	You're fucking right. I bet you were quite the world shaker back in the day.

MCQUEEN	You're fucking right.

BATISTA	I like Americans. I like American women, I like America money. I like American cars. What I don't like are arrogant Americans.

BATISTA	I see them everyday. We let them in. They act like Havana is a circus, a playground, prancing around like peacocks. They think Cuba is a novelty, a trifle to be chewed up, digested and shit out. Are you one of these, Mr.

MCQUEEN	McQueen, Steve McQueen.

BATISTA	Mr. McQueen. Are you one of these gringos?

MCQUEEN	No.

BATISTA	No. No. So then why do you think that you can come to my country, drink my rum, smoke our dope, fuck our women and then have los cojones to sell contraband on my streets!

BATISTA	Lucky Strike. "Light up a Lucky. It's Lucky Strike. Light up a  Lucky. It's Lucky time." ou know, for this type of indiscretion, it's a fine. A modest fine. One hundred American dollars. But maybe today, maybe today I make an example.

MCQUEEN	How 'bout we pretend it's yesterday.

BATISTA	Do you know who I am, yes?

MCQUEEN	Yes.

BATISTA	Do you know how many people I've killed?
 
BATISTA	Thousands, Mr. McQueen, thousands. Have you ever killed anyone?

BATISTA	No. It's one of the most satisfying things a man can do for himself. You feel so free. Taking that from someone. It's better than cocaine or fucking. To take someone's life, well, that's that's transcendent.

BATISTA	So, tell me, Mr. McQueen, why should I spare you? Because I must say, I'm feeling pretty transcendent right now.

MCQUEEN	I'll tell you why. Because you're a smart man, President Batista. Been the president of Cuba twice.

MCQUEEN	Helped us fight the Krauts and the Japs in the big one. Hell, this run, you just took what's yours. Damn everybody else.

MCQUEEN	Now I live in New York. I read the papers. Luciano. Lansky. They know who the boss man is down here. That's you. Fulgenico Batista. The boss man, right? So, offing me? Well, that gets out? That's bad business. That's a mistake. And if there's one thing that you do not do, it's make mistakes. Am I right?

MCQUEEN	So, Winters Winters, she's standing right here, okay? She's not supposed to move. Audience s going nuts at this point, because I'm over here, my pants are down, there's noth my hands are full! There's nothing I can do, right?

BATISTA	Cheers. To your pants being down.

BATISTA	Did you know, um, I lived in New York.

MCQUEEN	No, no, I didn't.

BATISTA	After my first presidency. I loved that city. Lights, Broadway, the pizza. Things are simpler in America.

MCQUEEN	Then why come back?

BATISTA	You can never underestimate the ceaseless allure of power. Power, it's like a capricious mistress. And when she whispers, you listen.

BATISTA	I'm afraid our time here has come to an end.

MCQUEEN	Oh, come on, Batista, we're just getting started.

BATISTA	You do have cajones, Steven. Why did you do it? Sell the cigarettes.

MCQUEEN	I needed the bread. I'm broke.

BATISTA	Ingenuity is a gift, my friend, and you're gonna need it. Selling contraband on the streets of Havana comes with a fine, a modest fine, one hundred American dollars. And you still owe it.

BATISTA	You still owe it, Mr. McQueen.

BATISTA	One hundred American dollars, Mr. McQueen.

SULA	Mm, really, then how'd you get out?

MCQUEEN	Took the ferry back to Key West.

SULA	Out of jail, sugar. How did you get out of jail?

MCQUEEN	Sold my helmet.

SULA	Your what, now?

MCQUEEN	My motorcycle helmet.

SULA	If that don't beat all.

MCQUEEN	What?

SULA	I guess God smiles on you, Steve McQueen.

MCQUEEN	Hang on. Damn it!

MCQUEEN	Put that in the glove box?

SULA	I surrender.

MCQUEEN	Funny.

MCQUEEN	Hey.

SULA	What?

MCQUEEN	It's a loaded gun. You'll shoot yourself in the foot, or worse, you'll shoot me.

SULA	Then show me how to use that thing.

MCQUEEN	I'll show you how to use it.

MCQUEEN	Feet shoulder-width apart, that's it. Good. You see that notch in the rear site above the hammer there? I want you to line that up, front site at the end of the barrel, okay? That is how you hit what you're aiming for.

MCQUEEN	Now listen, don't pull the trigger, you squeeze.

SULA	Oh my god! Now that's what I'm talking about. How 'bout a strong, black woman with a gun.

MCQUEEN	Okay, all right, give it here.

SULA	That's a lot of power. Why do you even need something like that? Don't you pay people?

SULA	Hey.

DOCTOR X	What happened on August 8, 1969?

DOCTOR X	Steve? What happened on August 8, 1969?

MCQUEEN	I survived.

DOCTOR X	An event like that would effect anyone.

MCQUEEN	Like I said. I'm here. They're not.

DOCTOR X	That's a rather cold position.

MCQUEEN	I took precautions to keep my family safe. That was the only outcome.

DOCTOR X	No guilt? Would you say it intensified your experience in France?

MCQUEEN	I had a goal. Something I had wanted to do for a long time. Something I felt had not been done correctly. Anything that did or did not happen in France was about that goal.

DOCTOR X	How would you characterize  your marriage at the time?

MCQUEEN	None of your goddamn business, that's how.

DOCTOR X	Steve, you said yourself, these sessions are about you and Neile.

MCQUEEN	What is it with you shrinks, huh? You think that just because you read a few books, that makes you some sort of an expert on how my bean works. I'll tell you what, doc. You could spend all damn day walking around in my noggin' and you wouldn't know the first thing about how it works.

DOCTOR X	Would you say you were this aggressive before the Benedict Canyon murders?

MCQUEEN	Yeah, always. Aggressive about my career, my women, my cars. If I want something, I get it. God damn anybody who gets in my way. Ya' understand?

DOCTOR X	So your career is important to  you.

MCQUEEN	Of course.

DOCTOR X	It's just that you mentioned it first, your career.

MCQUEEN	Without my career, there is nothing else. I don't have any rosy misconceptions about life. My folks were poor. I was poor, for too long. The career is money, everything follows the money.

DOCTOR X	Did you feel this way when you got married?

MCQUEEN	Yes.

DOCTOR X	But you were poor when you got married?

MCQUEEN	Yeah.

DOCTOR X	Was your wife?

MCQUEEN	No. What are you getting at?

DOCTOR X	Just what your priorities were. You loved your wife?

MCQUEEN	Yes, I did. I do.

DOCTOR X	You don't need money for that, Steve. Did she provide that security for you?

MCQUEEN	I knew my wife would never let me down. She would always support me. She would never abandon me.

MCQUEEN	Tell me about him.

NEILE	I don't want to do this right now.

MCQUEEN	Do what?

NEILE	Be interrogated. Not by you, you have no right.

MCQUEEN	I have every damn right. I'm your husband.

NEILE	You have no right, not because you're my husband, because you're a hypocrite!

MCQUEEN	Oh, this again?

NEILE	Parading women around all day-

MCQUEEN	What do you want from me?

NEILE	All night.

MCQUEEN	I want to be free. I'm gonna be free.

NEILE	Then be free.

MCQUEEN	Everybody in this country is doing whatever the hell they want. Why not me?

NEILE	You're supposed to be my husband! You swore an oath to
me!

NEILE	And that means something, Steve. Not having affairs and then confessing because you feel bad. Do you know how insulting that is? How embarrassing?

NEILE	You did the worst thing you could ever do to a woman. You diminished me. You made me feel less than. And I have to pretend like everything is fine. Like the dutiful wife of Steve fucking McQueen.

MCQUEEN	This beats Manhattan, huh?

NEILE	I don't know. I'm so fond of the city. I still remember the first day I saw it. It sure was a long way from the Philippines. 

MCQUEEN	Well, everything is a long way from the Philippines.

NEILE	Yeah, well, we'll be back soon anyway.

MCQUEEN	When?

NEILE	The Pat Boone Show, remember?

MCQUEEN	Don't you need a break?

NEILE	You don't take breaks, if you can help it.

MCQUEEN	It's just you're beat.

NEILE	It's a variety show. I can handle it.

MCQUEEN	I'll come with you, then.

NEILE	Honey, I know it's been tough the last few months, with our schedules

NEILE	I got something for you.

MCQUEEN	Well, if you're proposing, we're already married.

NEILE	Open it, silly.

MCQUEEN	Wow.

NEILE	It's St. Christopher, the patron saint of travelers and God knows we've traveled. He'll watch over you when I can't.

MCQUEEN	I love it.

MCQUEEN	Remember that day on th Avenue?

NEILE	You told me I was pretty.

MCQUEEN	You told me I was pretty, too.

NEILE	I certainly did.

MCQUEEN	God, it was like fireworks, baby. I want that moment again.

NEILE	That moment is gone. It's broken. We're broken.

MCQUEEN	Why did you have to do this to me?

MCQUEEN	Look, I picked you up, I thought we could have some fun, you know? You want to see me talk? Go to the movies.

SULA	To tell you the truth, your movies really aren't for me.

MCQUEEN	Is that so?

SULA	Guns, cars, all that macho shit. Real life is one thing. Movies, well, I don't get a thrill from that stuff on the screen. You can come across enough violence and aggression right outside your front door.

SULA	Now the good stuff, the dream stuff? That's why I go to the movies. To feel good.

MCQUEEN	They're not all like that.

SULA	Like what?

MCQUEEN	My movies. They're not all like you said, aggressive.

SULA	Oh, I know.

MCQUEEN	Then pick one.

SULA	Why?

MCQUEEN	I don't know. So, I don't feel like I'm wasting my life.

SULA	Love With the Proper Stranger. The Thomas Crown Affair. Sexy, romantic, an escape from the everyday. That's what I like. That's what I want to give.

MCQUEEN	So, you get to New York and then what?

SULA	How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

MCQUEEN	Okay, if it doesn't happen?

SULA	Was that ever an option for you?

MCQUEEN	Never.

SULA	Well, there you go.

MCQUEEN	It's just, you know, these cities, LA, New York, they chew up gals like you. Chew 'em up and spit 'em out.

SULA	Let 'em try. I'm better off than I was a minute ago. I'm better off every second I'm away from Weedpatch. There's no going back.

MCQUEEN	Every girl in the big city is running away from a place like a Weedpatch.

SULA	Don't you think I know that, Steve McQueen? I know what I'm up against, my skin color, my gender. But, I choose my fate, not anybody else.

MCQUEEN	Look, I'm not trying to make you cross. It's just, life ain't like the movies, kid.

SULA	Don't I know it.

MCQUEEN	You know, I trained with Martha Graham.

SULA	You did not train with Martha Graham.

MCQUEEN	I sure did. At the Neighborhood Playhouse.

SULA	You can dance?

MCQUEEN	Not a lick.

SULA	Why didn't you stick with it?

MCQUEEN	I had my reasons.

SULA	I bet you were pretty good.

MCQUEEN	We'll never know.

SULA	You never wanted to do a musical? I miss the grand MGM musicals.

MCQUEEN	Nobody wants to see me do that.

SULA	Jimmy Cagney did musicals.

MCQUEEN	Believe me, I know, it's just, I missed that period. A few years earlier, maybe, who knows, but

SULA	It didn't hurt, did it?

MCQUEEN	What's that?

SULA	Telling me something. Well, you're Steve McQueen. You do whatever you want.

MCQUEEN	We'll see about that.

SULA	Steve McQueen, song and dance man.

MCQUEEN	People just want to see you do one thing now. They want to see me get the bad guy. They want  to see me win. And there's always some kid waiting to knock you off the top spot. All it takes is one bad choice. I'm not gonna let that happen.

SULA	Well, it could've been a helluva thing.

MCQUEEN	No, I haven't decided yet. I get my end first. That's the deal, remember?

FREDDIE	Get ready to be happy. Using my considerable charm, I was able to twist some arms over at Warner Brothers.

MCQUEEN	I'm listening.

FREDDIE	Turns out Warner Brothers sold the car to a guy named Bob Ross. Worked in the editing department.

MCQUEEN	Good stuff. You got an address?

MCQUEEN	Got it.

FREDDIE	Wait, Steve.

MCQUEEN	I always said you're a stand up guy, Freddie.

FREDDIE	You said you'd pick a movie!

MCQUEEN	When I have the keys in hand, Freddie. Keys in hand.

FREDDIE	Steve, you son of a bitch, just pick

FREDDIE	God son of a bitch.

MCQUEEN	You sure you're gonna be okay out here?

SULA	The bus will be along in a spell. Don't you worry. 

MCQUEEN	It's too bad you're not headed to LA. That city could use more chicks like you.
 
SULA	No. I'm afraid this is the end of the road for us, Steve McQueen.

MCQUEEN	You know, you can just call me Steve.

SULA	There's something about your name that just begs for it to be said together.

MCQUEEN	Hey, I know people in New York. I'll make some calls.

SULA	We both know that's not going to happen.

MCQUEEN	Well, safe travels then.

SULA	I hope you find what you're looking for... Steve.

MCQUEEN	You know, you never told me your name.

SULA	Let's play something else.

SULA	That's my name.

SULA	Steve McQueen.

FREDDIE	It's time to go to work.

FREDDIE	You need to choose your next picture carefully.

HOFFMAN	I didn't think you came here.

MCQUEEN	Surprise.

HOFFMAN	Since you're here, if you'd indulge me, I just thought maybe  I could get some of your thoughts on this.

MCQUEEN	I'm all ears.

HOFFMAN	Now you read the book, right?

MCQUEEN	Yeah, my wife gave it to me.

HOFFMAN	It's justyou're attached to it, I mean, you are attached to it, right?

MCQUEEN	Yeah. What's your question, Dustin?

HOFFMAN	Oh, I'm just intrigued. I'm I'm circling, you know. I think there is a great story to be told here. I think I'm interested.

MCQUEEN	In what part, mine?

HOFFMAN	No, no, Dega... Louis Dega, the counterfeiter. I mean, there's definitely something there. I've been reading books on French  penal colonies, really fascinating stuff. Any idea who they want to direct?

MCQUEEN	I think it's Schaffner.

HOFFMAN	Schaffner... interesting.

HOFFMAN	Well, I'd love to know what you think.

MCQUEEN	About what?

HOFFMAN	About the part.

MCQUEEN	Your part? It's a fine part.	

HOFFMAN	No, your part. If I do this, it can't just be another buddy picture. It needs to go much deeper.

MCQUEEN	I don't know what I got next on my plate, kid. Now whether it's something you want to do is for you to decide. Do it, don't do it, doesn't matter to me. On the first day of shooting, I may see your face, I may even be happy, but right now, I don't give two shits.

HOFFMAN	This is an uncomfortable discourse for you. It's okay, I get it. You're uncomfortable talking about the craft. I thought we were actors.

MCQUEEN	Look, we are two different actors. Me not talking about it, doesn't mean that I don't want to, but it may mean I don't want to talk about it with you.

HOFFMAN	Yes, yes, that's what I'm talking about, this right here. I felt it. Did you feel that? I mean, we could be them, right now, confined, at wit's end. Have you spoken with Trumbo?

MCQUEEN	No.

HOFFMAN	I phoned him. Now he seemed  very open to the idea of working with me on Dega's character,  molding him.

MCQUEEN	Really, you phoned Trumbo?

HOFFMAN	Of course... I got thoughts.

MCQUEEN	You've got thoughts.

HOFFMAN	Yeah, I've got thoughts. I got ideas. Right now, Dega's character is very thin.

MCQUEEN	And you'd like to work with the writer to make him bigger.

HOFFMAN	Make him more fleshed out.

MCQUEEN	Fascinating.

HOFFMAN	Yeah, well, in Cherriere's book, Dega is just a minor character.

MCQUEEN	So you think he should be bigger?

HOFFMAN	Well, I think he should be more...

MCQUEEN	Fleshed out.

HOFFMAN	Fleshed out, exactly.

MCQUEEN	Sounds like you've given this a lot of thought.

HOFFMAN	I have.

MCQUEEN	You haven't signed yet, though.

HOFFMAN	No.

MCQUEEN	Why the cold feet?

HOFFMAN	I'm just weighing my options. Trying to figure out what works best for me.

MCQUEEN	Of course.

HOFFMAN	Yeah. Do you know that I did an entire film in Italian?

MCQUEEN	I did not.

HOFFMAN	That was a challenge, and that's what I'm talking about. Maybe on this film, we do the whole thing in French?

MCQUEEN	Yeah, I don't think the studio would go for that.

HOFFMAN	Well, who cares what the studios think? I mean, what do the tudios really know anyway? I mean, a studio wouldn't know real art if it walked right up to 'em, kicked 'em square in the nuts. Has Freddie talked to you about First Artists? 

MCQUEEN	He is my agent.

HOFFMAN	And are you on board?

MCQUEEN	Not that it's your business, but not yet.

HOFFMAN	Well, it could be my business. It could be our business together. Think about it. A production company completely run by the artists.

MCQUEEN	You know, if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

HOFFMAN	Streisand, Poitier...

MCQUEEN	Newman.

HOFFMAN	Newman, exactly. Why should we be left out in the cold?

MCQUEEN	Who said we would be? There's other ways to get control. I got plenty of juice.

HOFFMAN	That's not what I hear.

MCQUEEN	Be careful what you hear.

HOFFMAN	People talk in this town, Steve. I mean, your racing picture's in trouble. And Solar's deal, it's on the ropes.

MCQUEEN	What is this? You don't need mypermission, not to play Dega,  not to join First Artists. You looking for approval? Because I'm not your daddy. Or maybe you're just looking for a little insurance, is that it?

HOFFMAN	Maybe I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea of being a team  player and if Steve McQueen can be a team player, I guess I could, too.

MCQUEEN	I don't know what to tell you, kid. All my decisions come in due time.

HOFFMAN	This is good. It feels right. I think I want to play Dega.

MCQUEEN	I think you're a good actor. You may even be great, but make no mistake. I don't care if it's Trumbo, Schaffner or anybody else blowing smoke up your ass. That set will be mine. You got that?

DOCTOR X	A lot of the actors I see worry about losing the spotlight.

MCQUEEN	Never been a concern.

DOCTOR X	Until now. Tell me about France. Tell me about Le Mans.

MCQUEEN	They took the film away from  me.

DOCTOR X	Who did?

MCQUEEN	The suits at Cinema Center. The producers, Stulbarg and Bob Rosen.

DOCTOR X	Friends?

MCQUEEN	No, not particularly. I lost them too, though.

DOCTOR X	Misunderstandings?

MCQUEEN	Betrayals. My business partner, Bob. Then it was Stan, my agent. Where were they when I needed them, huh? Nowhere I'll tell ya, so I cut 'em loose.

DOCTOR X	Have you seen it?

MCQUEEN	I did.

DOCTOR X	And?

MCQUEEN	There were problems. We had a lot of guys, good guys looking to crack that story. We had John directing... Sturges. You know him?

DOCTOR X	I know of him.

MCQUEEN	Did three pictures with him and he walked out on me.

DOCTOR X	Walked out on the movie.

MCQUEEN	No, on me.

DOCTOR X	Would you agree that film is a collaborative effort? 

MCQUEEN	No, not on Le Mans. This was my vision. I knew what I wanted.

DOCTOR X	That's not always easily expressed.

MCQUEEN	I don't know how clear I gotta be.

DOCTOR X	Sounds like a stressful situation.

MCQUEEN	And then some, doc.

DOCTOR X	So, I imagine the probable outcome for the film is not good.

MCQUEEN	Nope.

DOCTOR X	As a man that is judged by his peers based on reviews and box office receipts, this must be a bitter pill. Le Mans was your passion project. A convergence of the two things that you've pretty much dedicated your life to.

DOCTOR X	Any accolades or awards would mean affirmation, affirmation of your vision.

MCQUEEN	I got awards, nominations, don't need 'em.

DOCTOR X	An Academy Award?

MCQUEEN	Nominated.

DOCTOR X	Once. You're a box office champion.

MCQUEEN	Right.

DOCTOR X	You have a strong drive to win, Steve, and both rewards and box office receipts constitute the pinnacle of winning in Hollywood. You didn't hope to achieve this with Le Mans?

MCQUEEN	Look, you want every movie to  be a success.

DOCTOR X	Even if Le Mans succeeds at the box office or the Academy Awards, I don't think you're gonna consider it a success.

MCQUEEN	No, I won't.

DOCTOR X	Because it was taken away from you and it's not your film. You sacrificed a lot for this film.

MCQUEEN	More than you know.

DOCTOR X	I want to know. I want you to tell me. That's why we're here. 

MCQUEEN	We're here because Neile asked me to.

DOCTOR X	It was a long shoot, an arduous shoot. Women, drugs fill the down time?

MCQUEEN	They didn't hurt.

DOCTOR X	So, that night

MCQUEEN	I don't want to talk about that night.

DOCTOR X	We've come a long way here today, Steve. I think we need to talk about it.

DOCTOR X	What did you do that night at the Chateau in France? Steve, what did you do that night?

MCQUEEN	I put a gun to my wife's head.

DOCTOR X	Why did you put a gun to your wife's head?

MCQUEEN	Because she told me she had an affair.

DOCTOR X	She already knew of your indiscretions?

MCQUEEN	Yeah, I always confessed.

DOCTOR X	But that only helped you, with your guilt. What else did you do? Steve?

MCQUEEN	I hurt her. I hurt my wife. I keep hurting her.

DOCTOR X	Why would you hurt your wife?

MCQUEEN	I can't stop.

MCQUEEN	Tell me about him.

NEILE	I already have.

MCQUEEN	Tell me again.

NEILE	No.

MCQUEEN	Where did you meet him? Where did you meet him, huh?

NEILE	Stop, don't do this to yourself.

MCQUEEN	Where did you meet him?

NEILE	Steve, stop, please.

MCQUEEN	Where did you meet him?

NEILE	On a plane.

NEILE	On a plane, I already told you.

MCQUEEN	Where did you do it? Where'd you do it?

NEILE	I don't remember.

MCQUEEN	Hm?

NEILE	Steve, stop.

MCQUEEN	Where did you do it?

NEILE	I said stop! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, baby.

MCQUEEN	Where?

NEILE	I'm so sorry. Beverly Hills Hotel.

MCQUEEN	I can't hear you!

NEILE	Beverly Hills Hotel.

MCQUEEN	What room?

NEILE	I don't remember the goddamn room!

MCQUEEN	Who started it?

NEILE	I don't I don't know.

MCQUEEN	Who started it?

NEILE	Maybe me, maybe him, I don't remember.

MCQUEEN	No maybes. Who started it?

NEILE	He did, he said hello. I told him my name.

MCQUEEN	Oh, he knew who you were, baby. Make no mistake.

NEILE	Yes, he knew who I was.

MCQUEEN	He fucked you because of me.

NEILE	He fucked me because of you.

MCQUEEN	Why did you do this, huh?

NEILE	I'm tired, baby. Let's please stop. 

MCQUEEN	This is what you get, whoring around? With another fucking actor! Humiliate me?

NEILE	I'm tired, baby, can we please stop?

MCQUEEN	Did you enjoy it? Did you enjoy it? Was he better than me? Did you enjoy it?

NEILE	Stop it!

MCQUEEN	Huh?

NEILE	Please!

MCQUEEN	Did you enjoy it?

NEILE	Stop it.

MCQUEEN	Huh?

NEILE	Stop! For the last time, yes! Yes, I did!

MCQUEEN	Thanks.

NEILE	I've been thinking about what's next.

MCQUEEN	For you?

NEILE	Yeah, I mean, the Vegas gig is over. Well, I gotta think about what's next. Variety shows are fine, but I don't know. I want to try something new, something different.

MCQUEEN	You know, things are going really good for me right now, so

NEILE	So

MCQUEEN	So, you know, we had a hard year, like you said, being apart, both of us working, it's no way to begin a marriage.

NEILE	Yeah, I know. What do you have in mind?

MCQUEEN	Well, we are married, you know, there's no reason why we shouldn't have a family like everyone else.

NEILE	Family, huh?

MCQUEEN	Yeah.

NEILE	Yeah?

MCQUEEN	Yeah.

NEILE	Yeah? How many kids, exactly, Mr. McQueen?

MCQUEEN	I don't know, let's see now, five, ten, a hundred. As many as we can make, Mrs. McQueen.

NEILE	Oh really?

MCQUEEN	You're gonna see, baby, I'm going all the way to the top. I'm not letting anybody kick me off, not ever.

NEILE	Hm.

MCQUEEN	I'm sorry... I'm so, so sorry.

NEILE	This is going to end one day, baby. That night in France and every night in between is one step closer, because I'll be dead, because you killed me.

MCQUEEN	Oh, no!

MCQUEEN	No, no, no, no.

NEILE	This is going to end one day, baby.

SULA	You're Steve McQueen.

FREDDIE	You hemorrhage your money and you burn every goddamn bridge back in France!

SULA	You can do whatever you want.

NEILE	You diminished me.

MCQUEEN	People just want to see you do one thing now, they want to see me get the bad guy. They want to see me win.

MCQUEEN	And there's always some kid waiting to knock you off the top spot.

DOCTOR X	You're a movie star, Steve. Certainly that comes with it's own set of... burdens.

FREDDIE	Just pick.

NEILE	You swore an oath to me!

MCQUEEN	You know what's really chappin' my hide, Freddie?

DOCTOR X	What happened August 8th, 1969?

MCQUEEN	It's not the car.

NEILE	Because you killed me.

JULIAN	Hard row to hoe.

MCQUEEN	What do you know?

JULIAN	I know what you're thinking.

JULIAN	Always you and the toys. They just got bigger.

MCQUEEN	Yeah, well, I ain't hanging on to this one.

JULIAN	Why not? It's lovely.

MCQUEEN	It's not right.

JULIAN	If it ain't right, you just get rid of it?

MCQUEEN	We still talkin' about cars?

JULIAN	William walked out on me, too, remember?

MCQUEEN	I was a baby. I found him, you know. Long Beach, a God damn stones' throw away.

JULIAN	What did he have to say for himself?

MCQUEEN	Son of a bitch was already dead. I never even saw his face.

JULIAN	Look in the mirror, sweetheart.

MCQUEEN	It was always so easy for you.

JULIAN	You don't say.

MCQUEEN	You could just take off or send me away.

JULIAN	I raised you, boy.

MCQUEEN	Uncle Claude raised me.

JULIAN	I needed to do right by me.

MCQUEEN	And what about me?

JULIAN	It wasn't all bad. There were some good ones. Some.

MCQUEEN	Berri? Where were you when he was using me as his punching bag?

JULIAN	You needed discipline. You acted up.

MCQUEEN	I defended myself.

JULIAN	You think it was easy for me?

MCQUEEN	I'm sure the booze helped.

JULIAN	A single mother? At that time? I was damaged goods and the whole town knew it. And you think you were such a peach. You were wild, boy, wild!

MCQUEEN	I wonder why that was.	

JULIAN	There were some good times.

MCQUEEN	It's a miracle I even survived.

JULIAN	Are you looking for excuses? You have the whole world, the whole world at your fingertips.  You have everything.

MCQUEEN	How do you think I got that, huh? You? I built this. Me. Plain and simple.

JULIAN	So easy to see the road when you're walking on the people that paved the way.

MCQUEEN	At least I'm here for my children.

JULIAN	You're doing a bang up job with that. You need to get straight, son. Your wife don't deserve what she's been given.

MCQUEEN	Pardon me, if my knees don't quake at your wisdom.

JULIAN	It's not about me. You're a grown man. Things are bad, I know.

MCQUEEN	They could be better.

JULIAN	You never let that stop you before.

MCQUEEN	Things get a little more complicated when you're me.

JULIAN	And who are you exactly?

MCQUEEN	I oughtta get goin'.

JULIAN	And where you goin' to, boy?

MCQUEEN	I got some things to sort out.

JULIAN	The things you got ain't easily sorted out. But, if anyone can do it, it's you.

MCQUEEN	Hello, engine.

RODNEY	You a mechanic?

MCQUEEN	I dabble.

RODNEY	You mind not dabbling on a stranger's car?

MCQUEEN	Sorry, kid, I just haven't seen one of these in a while.

RODNEY	Where ya been?

MCQUEEN	Away.

RODNEY	That yours?

MCQUEEN	Sort of.

RODNEY	You been around a lot of Chargers?

MCQUEEN	You could say that.

RODNEY	 torque flight, she's a real power plant.

MCQUEEN	That's a lot of car for a kid like you. You rob banks?

RODNEY	Nah, it's not mine.

MCQUEEN	Your pa's?

RODNEY	Foster dad's. He lets me work on it.

MCQUEEN	He let you drive it?

MCQUEEN	He gave you that though, didn't he? You gotta name, kid?

RODNEY	Rodney.

MCQUEEN	I'm Steve. You know, Rodney, it's not always going to be like this. Boys grow into men. It's the one thing we got going for us. You got a plan?

RODNEY	What kind of plan?

MCQUEEN	You know, for when you get out of here.

RODNEY	I don't know. I like cars.

MCQUEEN	Do what you want to do, but always have a plan.

RODNEY	Did you have a plan?

MCQUEEN	Well, not always.

RODNEY	You seem to be okay now.

MCQUEEN	Well, you'd be surprised.

MCQUEEN	Hey, Rodney, you know this guy?

RODNEY	Yeah, Mr. Ross.

MCQUEEN	Yeah, that's him. Thanks, kid.

RODNEY	Nice meetin' ya, Mr.

BOB ROSS	Holy shit, Steve McQueen?

MCQUEEN	All right, Ross, where is it?

BOB ROSS	I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Mr. McQueen.

MCQUEEN	You're Ross, Robert Ross, right?

BOB ROSS	Yes.

MCQUEEN	You know what I'm talking about. The car?

BOB ROSS	Wh what car?

MCQUEEN	The car, the Mustang GT .

BOB ROSS	Oh, the Mustang, sure.

MCQUEEN	I know Warner Brothers sold it to you. I want it back. I'll give you a fair price, but don't hustle me, Bob.

BOB ROSS	Hustle you, Steve McQueen I sold it. I only kept it about a ear. You know, it was just too much car for me. And with gas prices going up and all. For what it's worth, it was a real honor to drive. You were Frank Bullitt. It's my favorite movie. Can I ask you a question?

MCQUEEN	Fire away.

BOB ROSS	You really do all that driving?

MCQUEEN	What do you do again, Bob?

BOB ROSS	Oh, I'm in the pictures, too.

MCQUEEN	Doing what exactly?

BOB ROSS	I work in the editing department. 

MCQUEEN	Anything I've seen?

BOB ROSS	Probably not. You look a little winded, Mr. McQueen. Can I get you a drink or something? Some cereal, anything?

MCQUEEN	I'm gonna get going now, Bob.

BOB ROSS	Wawait, wait... I can get you the information of the fella I sold it to.

MCQUEEN	That won't be necessary. You take care.

BOB ROSS	Well, uh, bye.

BOB ROSS	Cereal?

IRV	Hey, boy! Hey, boy, you forgot to put away the tool set last  

IRV	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa! Wait a second, wait a second.

MCQUEEN	You see that kid there? Him and me are pals now. Say you understand.

IRV	I understand.

MCQUEEN	If anything happens to him, I'm coming back for you.

IRV	I understand.

MCQUEEN	You got a name?

IRV	Irv. Irving.

MCQUEEN	Put your hand down, Irv. I will come back. Good talk, Irv.

MCQUEEN	He won't be bothering you anymore. And you don't need his damn car, either.

RODNEY	Are you serious?

MCQUEEN	Serious as taxes.

RODNEY	I don't know what to say.

MCQUEEN	You don't have to say a thing, kid. You might want to check  the water pump.

RODNEY	Not a problem. Hey, who are  you?

INTERVIEWER	Do you see yourself making movies forever?

MCQUEEN	We don't get forever, do we?

INTERVIEWER	You know, I mean

MCQUEEN	I know. I tell ya, forever would be a long time. There'll be a day in the future where no one will really care about the films I make. There'll be something new. Somebody new. I think about, sometimes, that if you planted me in the future, I don't think anyone would  notice me. I'd be like a fly on the wall... just me. Anonymous.

INTERVIEWER	That seems hard to believe.

MCQUEEN	Look, I know one day I'll be looking back on the journey. It'll all be in the past. Only  in my memories.

MCQUEEN	There'll be mistakes and triumphs. That's part of the journey. It'll be quite the tale.

INTERVIEWER	Then what?

MCQUEEN	After the movies? Probably just head to Mexico.
