JOSH	In the early 1700s a sailor aboard a British merchant ship wrote

JOSH	the beauty of the ocean’s one of the world’s greatest treasures

JOSH	yet throughout history the men who have sailed her have overlooked it. Blinded by the desire for old gold and glittering gems they embarked on voyages to the end of the earth.

JOSH	and even beyond the boundaries of time.

CAPT.	LYNCHShe’s carrying treasure for sure. FIRE!

SAILOR #2	Capitan

SAILOR #2	They’re on us!

CAPT. LYNCH	On her mates! On her!!

PIRATE	Get in there, get in there now!

SAILOR#2	please please don’t kill me.

HOBBES	Ah Mr.Pistol this one here is going on and on

HOBBES	about the lost treasure of William Kidd

SAILOR#2	Por favor señor pirate we are just scientists. There’s a map. There’s a map. You can take. You can have the map.

PISTOL	where is this map your friend speaks of?

SAILOR#1	He is crazy from the sun.

SAILOR#1	We know of no treasure map.

PISTOL	Really?

SAILOR#1	OH! That map! Hahahah

PISTOL	Now this is the map down the cove. Just south of here.

SAILOR#1	Yes but you’ll never be able to decipher it without our help.

PISTOL	Let every man onboard be spared lest our spoils be tainted by unnecessary bloodshed.

SAILOR#1	Here’s to the Devil’s Wing and her merciful crew.

CAPT.LYNCH	Ah. So Mr.Pistol you spared the crew did ya?

PISTOL	Yes captain. Thought might need them.

CAPT.LYNCH	Oh, you thought but that be a Captain decision wouldn’t you say?

PISTOL	Aye Captain.

CAPT.LYNCH	Its thoughts like that that sealed the fate of your father.

CAPT.LYNCH	I would hate for something like that to happen to you.

CAPT.LYNCH	Easy lad. Easy. You know I had no choice.

CAPT.LYNCH	It was the code

PISTOL	Aye Captain.

LYNCH	You’re a good man, Pistol. Though when the devil comes for my soul I’ll need you there to talk him out of it. Haha!

CAPT.LYNCH	So what’s all this about a treasure map?

PISTOL	Here you are captain.

CAPTAIN LYNCH 	HUH?

PISTOL	Enjoy.

CAPT.LYNCH	Carry on.

HOBBES	whistles

PISTOL	The map get the map!

DAD	Thats it Josh. Forward stretch pull through. Feather. You’re getting great at this bud. HEDGE’s machine beeps

HEDGE	Hey guys I think I got something

JOSH	Nice one Hedge!

CHIP	Hey Josh 

JOSH	Whats up my man.

JOSH	Hey Brig! Hows the blog?

BRIG	ShhhI’m on a deadline.

HEDGE	Hey you know what I’m keeping it. Could be worth something. My Uncle Herm once found a Coca Cola sign that was worth $800.

CHIP	I saw your uncle selling housewares last week.

CHIP	By the way the odds of discovering anything of value with a metal detector on a public beach are very slim.

CHIP	If you add up all the hours that are necessary to find anything worth at least $20 you got about 132.6 hours so you’re basically working for about 60 cents per hour.

HEDGE	Whoa. You haven’t taken into account the

JOSH	The anomaly?

HEDGE	Yea! The anomaly. The unaccounted for unexplained event that occurs and defies all logic and odds.

CHIP	It can happen.

CHIP	But in your case you better stick to your job at the yogurt shop.

HEDGE	You’ll see.

JOSH	Let him dream

BRIG	I can’t believe someone is stealing the cool pirate artifacts from town.

BRIG	I’m going to get to the bottom of this . Who’s with me?

HEDGE	Hey Guys I got something!

HEDGE	Booya!

JOSH	What you got there Huckleberry?

HEDGE	Oh nothing. Just a treasure map!

BRIG	Hedgie baby I will never doubt you again.

JOSH	What do you think Brig?

BRIG	It looks like the real deal to me. Wait this is a map of Pirates Cove!

BRIG	See that’s Devil’s Bay and that’s Adam’s Lighthouse and the Clocktower!

JOSH	Oh you just reminded me. Summer school begins at 1030.

BRIG	Boring!

HEDGE	Cant we just ditch it? I mean its the last day anyway.

JOSH	My Mum paid $100 for that course and I’ll never hear the end of it if I don’t go. So you guys have to come too.

JOSH	Here

JOSH	We’ll stash it in the treehouse and we’ll figure this out after class.

BRIG	Maybe we should tell my dad. I mean what if somebody lost it.

HEDGE	I found it so rightfully its mine.

CHIP	Dude! You cutting us out? I thought we were a team?

HEDGE	Fine. Its all of ours

HEDGE	I don’t want to donate it to some lame museum!

BRIG	Excuse me!

HEDGE	I’m just saying. Lets go.

WOMAN#1	OH MY! Look at this. These are the Lost Colony actors.

WOMAN#1	For heaven’s sake. Have you ever seen anything like this?

WOMAN#2	NO. This is a disgrace.

SHERIFF	Ok, folks break it up. Break it up.

SHERIFF	Look at this

SHERIFF	Wakey, wake!

SHERIFF	You guys are guilty of section 11550

SHERIFF	Which means you had a little too much to drink last night

HOBBES	The ship

PISTOL	On the contrary sir. I barely had a sip last night.

SHERIFF	HAHA. I don’t think so. So why don’t we all get up and take a little stroll down to my station.

SHERIFF	Lets go I got a nice place for you to rest. ok.

SHERIFF	Come on you can walk it off. 

WOMEN	AH OH

SHERIFF	Come on you 2 look worse. Oh, Oh! Man. Lets go.

ADAMS	Where are we? Where’s the ship and the others? 

PISTOL	I do not know. But I dare say its best we play along. The less we say the better.

HEDGE	WOW. A real treasure map.

JOSH	Put that away. You want Byron to see it?

HEDGE	No.

HEDGE	OH crap there he is.

BYRON	Stop right there!

JOSH	Hi Byron Skipping summer school?

BYRON	Taking a home school course called advanced leisure studies. What do you think you’re doing?

CHIP	Walking.

BYRON	Well you’re ruining my view. My picture postcard view of my world with a bunch of losers in it.

HEDGE	YAH! Well how will your view look when I stuff it in that pitcher.

BYRON	WOAH. Was that a threat?

BRIG	Hey Byron

BYRON	Hello Brigette what’s up?

BRIG	oh nothing. Just taking some donations to the orphanage.

BYRON	Interesting. Not. Hey Brig when are you going to lose these fools and come over to right side of the tracks?

BRIG	Just because you’re the son of the mayor doesn’t make you royalty. And what makes you think I’d ever want to hang out with you?

BYRON	Well the answer to that question is known as the universal answer The answer that cuts through clarifies and captures the essence of people’s desires around the world.

BRIG	And what’s that?

BYRON	Money!

BRIG	Money isn’t everything.

BYRON	You’re right. Its the only thing.

BYRON	They’re up to something

BRIG	Jennie Goldstein just posted that my dad arrested a bunch of drunken pirates at the inlet beach. Look!

HEDGE	Probably just actors from the Lost Colony reenactment play.

CHIP	This map makes no sense. Wheres the X?

BRIG	Made sense to someone.

BRIG	Its like a puzzle but we don’t know where to start.

JOSH	I wish my dad were still around he’d know how to figure this out.He was good at this stuff.

HEDGE	Look for the Alpha there’s always an Alpha.

CHIP	A what?

HEDGE 	An alpha.

HEDGE	A starting clue to get you on the right track. Its like from the game Castle of Ghouls. You have to examine the paint strokes to find the secret passageway.

CHIP	Thats a big help.

JOSH	Everyone put your right hand on the skull of truth.

JOSH	Repeat after me.

JOSH	I swear not to tell anyone about the map.

EVERYONE	I swear not to tell anyone about the map.

JOSH	And whatever happens we will all get an equal share of the treasure or whatever we find.

BRIG	And whatever happens we will all get an equal share of treasure or whatever we find.

JOSH	It is done.

CHIP	Ok sounds good to me.

HEDGE	Wait.

HEDGE	What if one of us dies before we split us the treasure?

CHIP	What? Really?

HEDGE	I can’t help it my dad’s a lawyer.

BRIG	Your dad owns a yogurt shop and does bail bonds.

HEDGE	Same thing.

JOSH	Lets go.

BRIG	Hedge

HEDGE	What?

BRIG	On your face

HEDGE	What?

BRIG	Twinkie

MARGE	Just forget I said anything. Like my Momma always told me. You should always think twice before you open your mouth.

HEDGE	Nice

HEDGE	Hey Josh what about you? Earth to Josh!

JOSH	What? What did you say?

HEDGE	I said what are you going to do with your share of the treasure?

JOSH	I think I’ll buy a big sailboat like my dad’s he always wanted to sail around the world it was a dream of he and my mom’s.

HEDGE	Yea that’s cool. I think I’m going to open my own chain of ice cream stores across the country. Not frozen yogurt. The real McCoy.With every flavor you can think of and all kinds of toppings. Hot fudge caramel gummy bears

BRIG	Excuse me? Mr.Wonka?

HEDGE	What?

BRIG	First we have to find the treasure!

HEDGE	Right.

BRIG	COME ON we’ll be late for the meeting.

JOSH	I wonder what’s going on? 

HEDGE	I don’t know but it must be pretty big because my Dad never goes to these things.

CHIP	Same here

MAYOR	OK. Lets get this started.First of all I’d like to commend Father O’Reilly for another successful fundraiser for the orphanage And now about those recent burglaries 

VOICE IN AUDIENCE	Somebody took the anchor right of the front porch of my store

FATHER	And the ship’s bell was stolen from the church’s tower

WOMAN	And the spyglass is missing from Spyglass Point.

MAYOR	Alright. Alright calm down. Sheriff Basnight is on top of this and I am sure the culprits will be apprehended soon.Sheriff?

SHERIFF	We’re working on a few leads.

MAYOR	Now on to the main reason for this meeting. We have after much debate made a decision to make a change. That will boost the local economy exponentially. May we dim the lights please. As you know the treasure hunting theme has lost its lustre. Mainly because nobody has actually found any treasure here. Tourism is at an all time low. Thanks to an agreement with the Beacher family trust that is all going to change.I present to you Beacher’s Dinoworld! We are projecting a revenue increase of over 400% within the first year alone and the sky is the limit.

WOMAN#2	No its ridiculous!

VICTORIA	What about the theater? We put so much time and money into that place?

MAYOR	All the existing businesses will be incorporated into the new theme. Maybe relocated…

VICTORIA	But the town’s hall the Pirate’s Cove. Thats where the pirates really were and its part of our history.

FATHER	Shes right. And I say BOO

VICTORIA	Yea BOO.Boo!

BRIG	Now we really have to find the treasure.

BRIG	According to British historians, William Captain Kidd was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy after returning home from a voyage to the Indian Ocean. Treasure seekers have searched the waters of North Carolina for almost 200 hundred years in the hopes of locating a stash of treasure from his piracy raids up and down the pre colonial coastline. A character he knows who claimed to sail with him described him as a brilliant strategist mathematician and navigator. He was subsequently captured but his treasure was never recovered.

JOSH	Check this out.

JOSH	According to this St. Brendan of Connifair was known as Brendan the Voyager. The patron saint of sailors navigators and whales.

CHIP	Thats cool. But what has that to do with the treasure?

JOSH	Look familiar?

BRIG	Doesn’t that look just like the statue in the town square?

JOSH	Right!

JOSH	The original statue was pointing towards the ocean. This statue is pointing towards the 

ALL KIDS TOGETHER	Church?!

JOSH	Anything?

HEDGE	YEA pretty sure its a church.

CHIP	28 Pews and no clues.

BRIG	All looks pretty standard

JOSH	The Voyager points to where me shanty rings true and fills the air on summers day with dreams of gold that blossom visions from days of old. Shanty means song. Summer’s…day

JOSH	My name was William Kidd as I sailed as I sailed. My name was William Kidd when I sailed My name was William Kidd God’s laws I did forbid so wickedly I did as I sailed.

JOSH	Hey guys!

HOBBES MUMBLING	Aye aye captain

MOUNTJOY	Hobbes oy shake a leg! Silver

HOBBES	Silver? Alright then divvy up!

MOUNTJOY	Divvy it up?

HOBBES	Oh to eat lad! I could eat a tubful of lollies!

HEDGE	On clouded night by Beacon’s light the secret shall be known. Reflected from the flow of night beneath the skull and bones.

HEDGE 	BOOYA!

ADAMS	Aye ya yay! What a cruel fate bra!

MOUNTJOY	At least we left them a ship! Hey?

HOBBES	Its not how it happened.

ADAMS	No?

HOBBES	Oh no. A hundred men sailed the Matador that night. Took 2 cannonballs portside and then they arrived. And the men screaming and screaming for their dear lives footsteps approach

HOBBES	Oh hello Geoffrey.

HOBBES	Did you get the map?


PISTOL 	NO. But I know where it is. We just have to wait for the opportunity to arise.

PISTOL	What in God’s name is this?

BIRDS AND SCORE	SCORE

JOSH	Chip? Whats that for?

CHIP	Treasure you dope!

BRIG	Its obviously the right place.

BRIG	These markings don’t make any sense.

CHIP	I’ve got it. Its a triangulation.

HEDGE	What?

CHIP	Those numbers are degrees. Triangulation uses 2 points and the angles

CHIP	between them to pinpoint THE THIRD.

CHIP	You have to use these geographic markers to determine the exact

CHIP	Spot of the treasure.I think I have an app for that.

BRIG	Cool

JOSH	That ones easy Its right there!

BRIG	So then

BRIG	The second point would be

BRIG	Right on top of that ridge.

JOSH	There aren’t any trees over there.

JOSH	There has to be a stump or roots or something

JOSH	All we have to figure out is where that tree used to be.

JOSH	then we can use the angles to pinpoint the treasure

VICTORIA	Do you like it? I think it might be a little over the top.

PISTOL	You’re beautiful.I mean  its beautiful.I mean you’re beautiful in it. Right

VICTORIA	Oh, Mister Pistol I think you’re blushing.

PISTOL	No. No No. Its just I’ve forgotten my sword. My sword. I’ve forgotten my sword. And now I’m going to retrieve it. That way. Forgive me.

LITTLE PIRATE	Blast ye scoundrels PISTOL With gumption mate!

JOSH	Professor Ratliffe?

PROF	At your service Good evening Gentlemen

JOSH	What are you doing here?

PROF	I’m supposing the very same as yourself. Searching for treasure.

BYRON	Evening Losers!

PROF	Aah Master Beecher. Good of you to join us

BRIG	I knew you had something to do with this. He’s been behind this whole thing!

BYRON	Well aren’t you the smart one! Yes, treasure seeking requires a significant cash Investment

JOSH	We found the treasure

BYRON	So I see.

BYRON	And what a good job you’ve done. I may never have been able to recover it without your help.

JOSH	Its rightfully ours!

PROF	I beg to differ. With all due respect I’ve been in pursuit such treasure through space and time for over 300 hundred years

PROF	While searching for Capt. William Kidds lost treasure

PROF	I come upon a certain Spanish explorer who had a very peculiar mechanism in his possession.

BRIG	Let me guess a time machine?

PROF	A time machine indeed. And together we’d retrieve all of the world’s greatest lost treasure Somehow he’d learned how to manipulate the space time contineum.

SPANISH PIRATE	Sendejo!

PROF	What have you done?

PROF	I simply fell into the time vortex unfortunately some poor soul took my place in the past.

PROF	Alas

PROF	These mutinous gents arrived on the very ship from which I came. With my time machine!

PROF	Hey after him you fool! After him 

SYLVAN	Damn you

PISTOL	Right

JOSH	We found it. And some real pirates showed up with Prof Rattliff and stole it. They kidnapped my friends.

HEDGE	You see Chip

HEDGE	This is the anomaly the unexpected event that happens and defies

HEDGE 	ALL ODDS!

DAD 	HEY!

CHIP	I can’t believe it

JOSH(VO)	I guess everyone has a different idea of what the true treasure of Pirate’s Cove is.

JOSH	Some would say its a stash of ancient gold and jewels

JOSH	Others would argue that true love is the treasure they seek.

JOSH	Or perhaps the mystery of what lies beyond the horizon is what drives them.

JOSH	But to me the greatest treasures the world has to offer are the friends and family who

JOSH	Sail with you on the adventure of life.

HEDGE	I can’t believe we had our hands on all that treasure

HEDGE	and we let it go 

BRIG	What about the time machine?

BRIG	Man that had some interesting possibilities…history

CHIP	Yea, We’ll just wait till they come back.

HEDGE	Wait Chip you are the one person who would know the odds of them coming back are slim and none!
CHIP	What if someone

CHIP	Altered the date coordinates of the time machine?

HEDGE	You didn’t?

CHIP	Yeppers

BRIG	What day did you enter?

CHIP	Next Tuesday.

DAD	What?
