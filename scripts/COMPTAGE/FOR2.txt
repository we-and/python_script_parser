RAIN	Stop, stop!! He's coming!! He's coming!!

MICHELLE	Stop you're making it worse...

MICHELLE	don't tie her down. Stop!!

MICHELLE	(Whispering) The medicine makes her a zombie. 

MICHELLE	(Whispering) Of course she's going to try and wean herself off of it.

JOHN	It doesn’t make any sense.

RAIN	Use your checklist right now.

RAIN	Is this possible? 

RAIN	Yes. Could it exist here?

RAIN	Is anyone else reacting?

JOHN	It's been years and that's the best you can do? 

RAIN	…yes.

JOHN	You're a doctor. 

MICHELLE	Jumping to anger isn’t helping. 

JOHN	I’m sorry, isn’t your fault it's just...

JOHN	she said she was feeling better.

DOCTOR	We see that regularly with skitsophrenia. Patients take their medicine, feel better and think they can go off it. But it can't be cured. 

JOHN	She’s going to be an adult and then what? I'm supposed to lock her in her room for the rest of her life?

MICHELLE	John.

JOHN	What is there...

JOHN	another way? What?

DOCTOR 	Short of admitting her into a…

DOCTOR	psychiatric facility…

JOHN	No...

MICHELLE	Absolutely not!

DOCTOR	Her psychiatrist can try switching her over to an atypical antipsychotic, which may have fewer side effects.

MICHELLE	Hey, baby.

RAIN	Is this happening?

MICHELLE	John...

MICHELLE	she's awake.

JOHN	Hey baby.

JOHN	Hanging in there?

RAIN	Yeah, I'm okay.

NURSE	(Over intercom) Maintenance staff please call...

NURSE ROSA 	Can I get you anything?

NURSE ROSE	Rain?

MICHELLE	Rain...

MICHELLE	Didn't you said you wanted something to sketch with?

RAIN	Uh wait...Could I have a pencil?

NURSE ROSA 	We can’t give...

MICHELLE	Just a soft...

MICHELLE	sketch pencil.

NURSE ROSA 	I'll get you some Crayons?

RAIN	I don't know what to say.

DR. PANGLOSS 	Whatever comes to mind.

DR. PANGLOSS	Nothing?

RAIN	Too much.

DR. PANGLOSS 	Well let’s start with what you remember then.

DR. PANGLOSS	Do you recall anything that triggered it?

RAIN	Um…I..I don’t know. I remember...

RAIN	going upstairs and then...

RAIN	being on the bus.

DR. PANGLOSS  	But you never left your house.

RAIN	I was in the woods, though. There was a man chasing me.

DR. PANGLOSS	Rain, these...

DR. PANGLOSS	episodes get increasingly worse each time you try going off your meds.

RAIN	You just…you don’t understand. I…I get that the medicine can make me...more stable or whatever. But I...it makes me feel like a zombie and I can’t paint if I can’t feel...

RAIN	anything. 

DR. PANGLOSS  	We can try experimenting until we find the right...

RAIN	Experimenting? I’m not…I'm not a lab rat!

DR. PANGLOSS	Not taking it isn’t an option.

DR. PANGLOSS 	One more misstep and the state is going to institutionalize you, Rain.

RAIN	It’s not fair... People see and hear God. No one thinks they’re nuts.

DR. PANGLOSS  	That’s not the same thing.

RAIN	Why not?

RAIN	(Sighs) Is everything okay?

JOHN	Yeah monkey. Everything’s fine.

JOHN	Jack of all trades?

DANI MCCONNELL	(Laughs) Yeah and master of none.

RAIN	Mom what’s wrong?

MICHELLE	It’s been a rough week.

RAIN	I’m sorry.

MICHELLE	No, no, no. It's just…your dad and I handle things differently.

DANI MCCONNELL	Looking forward to having you back in class, Rain.

RAIN	Grandma and grandpa? 

JOHN	Who else?

RAIN	Didn’t work.

JOHN	I’ll let you tell them that. (Sighs) For what it’s worth, they sent me ‘good luck’ balloons when I told them I wanted to open my own restaurant.

RAIN	And look how that ended up. Sold out.

JOHN	Rain?

JOHN	Hey baby, it's gonna be okay.

RAIN	Stop!

JOHN	Hey...

JOHN	Don't worry about all this okay. I'll get if fixed up. 

JOHN	Oh it's okay monkey. It's okay. 

JOHN	Hey why don’t you stay in the guest room until I get it all put back together. 

MICHELLE	This is my fault.

JOHN	You have not lost it brother. You like strawberry-pomegranate? Are you cool with that?

RAIN	Just a normal PBJ’s fine dad. 

JOHN	It's normal. It's just like…spruced up.

RAIN	Dad I'm sure it's fine...

JOHN	Put my magic touch on it. Hey uh...

JOHN	I know you're uh...

MICHELLE	I've missed this.

JOHN	on the way out the door and stuff...

RAIN	Dad...

JOHN	I want you tot know that if you need to chill...

RAIN	Dad!! Dad, Dad!!

JOHN	…when you go to school, you're gonna feel...

JOHN	feel a little bit um...

RAIN	Dad I love you and I understand that you're worried but I'm good. You gotta let me try okay.

JOHN	All right.

RAIN	It’s not like I’m on drugs or anything.

RAIN	Best jelly I’ve ever had.

JOHN	It’s jam, it's made from fruit pulp.

MICHELLE	Have a great day sweetheart.

RAIN	Love you. Bye.

JOHN	Bye I love you.

DANI MCCONNELL	(Sighs) Okay we’ve got a lot to cover if any of you...

DANI MCCONNELL	have a hope in hell of passing your finals.

DANI MCCONNELL	Welcome back Rain. Care to join us? Come on. 

DANI MCCONNELL	So I gotta see more quotes in your essays. I mean you can't just...

DANI MCCONNELL	say “Heathcliff is a psycho.”

DANI MCCONNELL	Uh, well, I mean, ah...

DANI MCCONNELL	well…You can’t just say “Heathcliff is a sadistic ass because he spent his entire life pining after his childhood crush and plotting against the man she ends up marrying.” And I’m not disagreeing with you but back up your claims.

DANI MCCONNELL	Lets get textual.

DANI MCCONNELL	Okay?

DANI MCCONNELL	Got it? Do I see nodding heads? Yeah please, good. 

DANI MCCONNELL	All right let’s get going.

RAIN	Chicken and guacamole.

RAIN	sit with you guys?

ALEXA	Oh no um sorry.

ALEXA’S FRIEND 1	Not for all those personalities.

RAIN	That's not what...

ALEXA	Careful, she might go all Carrie on us.

ALEXA’S FRIEND 1	Whoa.

ALEXA	Yeah, you wouldn’t even believe half the things I've seen.

ALEXA’S FRIEND 2	I heard she tried to kill herself.

ALEXA'S FRIEND 1	She just does it for attention.

CALEB	Hey. I’m Caleb.

CALEB	Wanna pick a card, any card.Is this possible?

CALEB	You know what just…just take...

CALEB	now it's Tarot so it's a little more...

CALEB	difficult. You remember it? 

RAIN	Uh huh.

CALEB	Throw it back in the deck.

CALEB	You really gotta stop talking.

RAIN	I don’t like magic.

CALEB	Well you're in luck because this isn't magic this is skill. All right, tap the top of the deck. Give it a little tap tap. See this is the really interactive part where I just distract you that way you're really impressed when I swap it out and I uh flip over your card...

CALEB	and that's yours. 

CALEB	What it's not yours?

RAIN	Uh huh.

CALEB	Not I'm kidding I know that. I just gave you that one as a gift to you know balance out your...

JOHN	Yeah, no I’ve been wanting to get back into it...

JOHN	it's just…work’s been hectic, and I should probably be around here...

JOHN	Thanks though, thanks for...

JOHN	thinking of me. 

RAIN	Dad...

JOHN	Oh hey. 

JOHN	Oh, it was nothing. It was Phil.

JOHN	He's catering some events this month...

JOHN	and wanted to know if I could help out that's all. 

RAIN	You’re not going to?

JOHN	No I don’t have time.

RAIN	No you should go. You haven't cooked in forever.

JOHN	I cook for you all the time.

RAIN	Mom and I don’t count.

JOHN	You sure?

JOHN	Really?

RAIN	Yes.

JOHN	I don't have to do it.

RAIN	I'll be fine.

MICHELLE	Rain?

MICHELLE	Honey...

MICHELLE	your father’s going to take the door off the hinges if you keep locking it.

RAIN	I know. It’s just habit. Sorry. Did you hear anything?

MICHELLE	Un huh.

MICHELLE	So how was your first day back?

RAIN	Well it was great yeah. Everyone thinks I’m a freak.

MICHELLE	I doubt that. Isn’t it cool to be...

MICHELLE	different nowadays?

RAIN	(Mumbles) It's like the biggest event of the year for them. It’s ridiculous. I mean everyone knows. Even my teachers.

MICHELLE	It will blow over.

MICHELLE	Someone will get a bad hair cut, or ALEXAwill make out with someone’s boyfriend and...

MICHELLE	they’ll forget all about it.

RAIN	No she just won't talk to me anymore. She’s got like cool new friends who love to hear horror stories about hanging out with the crazy girl. 

MICHELLE	Stop calling yourself that. 

RAIN	It’s like I’m social currency.

RAIN	I don’t know I mean I don't care. Gives me more time to paint. I think that’s what I want to study.

MICHELLE	In college?

RAIN	Mm-hmm.

RAIN	You don’t think I’ll get in.

MICHELLE	No I just...

MICHELLE	I didn’t know that’s what you wanted. I think…I think that would be wonderful for you.

MICHELLE	How long is this going to take?

RAIN	Whoa is me.

RAIN	I have a spectacularly talented daughter who's willing to spend hours memorializing me.

MICHELLE	I can actually feel myself aging.

RAIN	Yeah, you're right...

RAIN	a lot of wrinkles. Who knows how long that will take. 

MICHELLE	Hmmm.

MICHELLE	Bring your sweater. 

RAIN	It's 90 degrees outside. I'm already roasting. 

MICHELLE	Mmmm.

MICHELLE	It feels good.

RAIN	Yeah for a sauna.

RAIN	Bye.

COACH	Ready guys…and go.

RAIN	Hey. I’ll walk with you.

ALEXA	No thanks. Wouldn't want to catch your crazy. Hey wait up. 

CALEB	Hey! What are you up to?

RAIN	What are you doing?

CALEB	Cutting class, I guess.

RAIN	Well stop.

CALEB	What, it's just P.E. Letter from the nurses office...

RAIN	I mean stop following me.

CALEB	Whoa. Are you okay?

RAIN	No, I’m not okay. My best friend won’t even talk to me anymore.

CALEB	Why not?

RAIN	I don’t know.

CALEB	There's gotta be some kind of reason.

RAIN	When I said I didn’t know, I mean I kind of know, I just don’t really want to talk about it.

CALEB	Oh.

CALEB	Well you wanna get out of here? I can take you home. Or wherever.

RAIN	Wherever?

CALEB	Yeah.

RAIN	Okay.

RAIN	We’re gonna be pedaling this thing like the Flintstones.

CALEB	Yeah sorry, I’m still restoring it.

RAIN	How long has it been?

CALEB	A... while. 

CALEB	It wasn’t running so I had to rebuild the carburetor...

CALEB	I got new rotors, brake pads changed the starter, rolled and replaced the rack and pinion. 

CALEB	It's been about 6 months. But you know, ran out of money before I got to the body but at least it's running. 

RAIN	For now. 

RAIN	So is that...

RAIN	what you want to do?

CALEB	What?

RAIN	Be a mechanic?

CALEB	No uh…well…Car mechanics and quantum mechanics aren’t closely related. They're more like homonyms. You know a wave versus two wave.

CALEB	That make sense?

RAIN	That's cool.

CALEB	Oh shush…shit. Okay we're…we're gonna have to stop here. 

RAIN	Why?

CALEB	My…my windshield wipers don’t work well.

CALEB	We're gonna be stuck here for a minute.

RAIN	Do you have to do that?

CALEB	What?

RAIN	Just magic. Right now.

CALEB	I already told you it’s not magic. It’s skill. It's…it's a puzzle it's slight of hand. Everything's contingent on sleight of mind.

CALEB	Everything’s an illusion.

VOICE	Rain, Rain...

VOICE	get out while you can!

ANNOUNCER	Back to your weather on 7…(Inaudible)

CALEB	Are you okay?

RAIN	Mm-hmm.

CALEB	Well you’re fidgeting, and your face is flushed, and now your breathing has shortened. So... 

CALEB	what are you afraid of?

RAIN	Nothing you're just talking really fast.

CALEB	Guess I can have that effect on people sometimes. I mean just because I don't like...

CALEB	talking about inconsequential stuff like the weather.

CALEB	Which would be ironic actually. 

RAIN	Hmm?

CALEB	It was the weather? You know…like RAINafraid of rain.

VOICE	Right now. RAINrun! (Laughter)

RAIN	No I…I just want to go home.

CALEB	Right here?

RAIN	Yeah.

CALEB	It's okay.

RAIN	You didn’t have to get my door.

CALEB	I did. The passenger door doesn't open from the inside. So, it's...

CALEB	Sorry for wasting your day.

RAIN	Oh you didn’t waste it.

CALEB	You don’t have to protect my feelings either. 

RAIN	It's actually one of the best days I've had in a really long time. 

CALEB	We didn't do anything.

RAIN	Yeah.

CALEB	Have a nice night.

RAIN	You, too.

RAIN	Look um…something I need to tell you. Don't get freaked out or anything. 

RAIN	I'm like sick. No, I mean not like cancer. Like…in my head. (Sighs)

JOHN	Hey, Rain.

JOHN	Oh hey. Okay. This thing’s gonna go really late, and I got my guys working so...

JOHN	they're gonna handle the cleanup. I will be home as early...

JOHN	as I can I promise. And I have my phone. 

RAIN	Okay. 

JOHN	Where's your phone? Do you have it?

RAIN	Yes. I have my phone. 

JOHN	All right.

MICHELLE	I literally just told you not to lock the door.

MICHELLE	RAINI'm not going to tell you again.

MICHELLE	Where were you?

RAIN	I…I was at the library. I was...

RAIN	I was studying.

MICHELLE	Mhmm.

MICHELLE	What’s his name?

RAIN	Who?

MICHELLE	You forget your father and I were study buddies.  

RAIN	(Chuckles) That's gross.

RAIN	His name is Caleb. 

MICHELLE	That’s a nice name. 

MICHELLE	I’ve got to call your grandparents. You should help your father finish loading up. 

CHILD	Help!

RAIN	It's not real, it's not real…

JOHN	Hey. 

RAIN	Did you hear that?!

MICHELLE	What?

RAIN	There was a girl...a girl next door…a tiny little girl. 

JOHN	Um where?

RAIN	She was screaming for help! Did you hear her?

JOHN	Um…no I didn't hear anything.

MICHELLE	Where did you see her?

RAIN	In the…over there in the window.

JOHN	RAINthere's nobody out here.

RAIN	No, she was there, I swear. She was standing there and then she grabbed her. 

JOHN	Who?

MICHELLE	Ms. McConnell?

RAIN	No I don’t know! I couldn’t see.

MICHELLE	RAINuse your checklist.

JOHN	Is it...

JOHN	possible? No. She doesn’t even have kids.

RAIN	Yeah...

RAIN	I know but that’s the point Dad.

JOHN	This is ridiculous.

MICHELLE	Honey.

JOHN	Alright...

JOHN	why don't you try to go to bed and then we’ll go over there tomorrow and…we'll check it out okay.

JOHN	On or off?

RAIN	On is good.

RAIN	Mom? 

MICHELLE	Yeah?

RAIN	Will you stay with me?

MICHELLE	Of course, baby girl.

JOHN	You having second thoughts?

RAIN	No.

JOHN	You sure?

RAIN	Dad.

DANI MCCONNELL	Oh. Morning. 

JOHN	Morning.

DANI MCCONNELL	Wasn't expecting guests.

JOHN	Yeah can we just talk to you for a sec?

DANI MCCONNELL	Yeah sure. Come on in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Sorry about the mess. Still fixing her up.

JOHN	You should see my place.

DANI MCCONNELL	I’ve seen your yard. (Laughter)

DANI MCCONNELL	So what can I do for you?

JOHN	Okay this might sound a little bit weird, but um Rain…

JOHN	has been hearing these noises and...

JOHN	we just that we would come by to make sure...

JOHN	everything was…everything was good.

DANI MCCONNELL	What kind of noises?

RAIN	A little girl.

DANI MCCONNELL	A little girl?

DANI MCCONNELL	The folks across the street have kids. That’s probably what you heard.

RAIN	She’s lying.

JOHN	(Under his breath) Rain...

RAIN	There's a little…

RAIN	girl in your attic. I saw her. 

DANI MCCONNELL	In my attic?

DANI MCCONNELL	(Chuckles) I have an attic...

DANI MCCONNELL	but there’s no one up there as far as I know. 

DANI MCCONNELL	I’m happy to bring you up there.

JOHN	No, no, no, no...

JOHN	that's…we're good thank you...

RAIN	Yeah...

RAIN	(Talking over John) I want to.

DANI MCCONNELL	Oh. (Laughs)

DANI MCCONNELL	Okay well this does not make me look good. (Laughs)

JOHN	Quite a collection.

DANI MCCONNELL	Yeah. 

DANI MCCONNELL	I have not been up here since Graham passed. 

DANI MCCONNELL	She made each one by hand. Their clothes were much nicer than anything she made us. (Laughs)

DANI MCCONNELL	yeah sure does bring back memories.

DANI MCCONNELL	Oh geez don't…don't... 

DANI MCCONNELL	don't even worry about it. (Laughs)

DANI MCCONNELL	Jeez.

JOHN	Hey um…we’ll get outta your hair. 

JOHN	You good, Rain?

JOHN	Thank you for humoring her. 

DANI MCCONNELL	It's not a problem.

RAIN	Humoring me, dad? What do you think this is a joke!?

JOHN	No, I don't.

RAIN	She’s lying! She's using the almanacs, there's one there from 2018!

JOHN	So what, Rain?

RAIN	She said she hadn’t been up there!

JOHN	Who gives a shit whether she’s been in her own attic or not?

RAIN	What you never believe...

RAIN	me instead of someone you don't even like!!

JOHN	Hold on I get it, I get it, she's wacko...

JOHN	okay. But she sounds a hell of a lot more logical then you do...

RAIN	Can't you just give me the benefit of the doubt. Just one day… (Both arguing at same time) I'm crazy right! I hear things I see shit! 

JOHN	Stop it!! Just stop it for a second!! 

JOHN	Everything is...

JOHN	fine over there! When are you going to get that through your head?!

RAIN	What if that was me up there?

JOHN	Oh God.

JOHN	There's no one up there. There's no one up there. There's no one up there. It's your mind. Your mind is just playing tricks on you. Please stay away from that house okay. 

JOHN	If she files another complaint the state is going to put you in a hospital. 

JOHN	Can you promise me? (Sighs)

RAIN	Okay. 

JOHN	(Under his breath) Come here. Missing girls Florida

DR. PANGLOSS	So how have you been feeling...

DR. PANGLOSS	since you’ve been home?

RAIN	Better than being strapped down and experimented on.

RAIN	I can't sleep even thought I'm taking my medication which I don't really need in the first place. 

DR. PANGLOSS	We’ve been through this before, Rain.

RAIN	It’s not helping...

RAIN	and I just want to feel like myself. 

DR. PANGLOSS 	You realize if you choose to go off your medication...

DR. PANGLOSS	you’re likely to end up in an institution where they’ll force you to stay on it.

RAIN	I’m just so sick of this.

RAIN	I know things are happening, and no one believes me. And then it makes me question whether it’s just in my head, even though I know it’s real.

DR. PANGLOSS	Is there anything in particular that you’re unsure of?

RAIN	Do you think I’m stupid?

DR. PANGLOSS  	Do you think I think you’re stupid?

RAIN	I know they tell you things.

DR. PANGLOSS	Who is ‘they’?

RAIN	They told you about the little girl, right?

DR. PANGLOSS  	What girl?

RAIN	My neighbor is keeping a little girl in her attic.

DR. PANGLOSS	Rain, this is not like your other hallucinations.

DR. PANGLOSS	This is a serious accusation one that will have equally serious consequences...

DR. PANGLOSS	for one of you.

RAIN	I heard her screaming.

DR. PANGLOSS  	Have you run through your questions?

RAIN	Mmm hmm.

DR. PANGLOSS	Did anybody else reacted to her?

RAIN	No, no she’s keeping her hidden.

DR. PANGLOSS	Why would...

DR. PANGLOSS	she do that?

RAIN	I don't know. I…I think...

RAIN	I think she kidnapped her and she's keeping her chained up and she screams for help.

DR. PANGLOSS	Do you think it’s possible that you might be projecting your own fears of feeling confined or restrained?

FEMALE VOICE	Rejecting your own fears so you can find the restrained cause.

RAINON PAINTING	Help me, get me...

RAINON PAINTING	out of here!!

RAINON PAINTING	Get me out of here!! 

RAINON PAINTING	Help me!! 

RAIN	Yeah.

DR. PANGLOSS	What’s that?

RAIN	Yeah... I guess it could be possible.

RAIN	Ow!

JOHN	I'm sorry sweetie you okay?

RAIN	Yeah, it's just a cut. Was worried you were Mom...

RAIN	making her dinner to cheer her up. 

JOHN	That's nice. What's that?

RAIN	It's Ranch.

JOHN	Buttermilk aioli?

JOHN	And I see some pan roasted Levin bread with urban...

JOHN	fused tomatoes puree...

JOHN	and a blend of artisanal cheeses.

RAIN	Dad, she's coming distract her!

MICHELLE	What's going on?

RAIN	Nothing! Nothing Mom! Please... 

RAIN	don't come in!

MICHELLE	Okay. 

MICHELLE	Okay.

CALEB	The singularity is near.

RAIN	Hmmm?

CALEB	We’re all going to merge with artificial intelligence. Not me…but you know...

CALEB	'them, we’. I’ll be fine.

RAIN	How’s that?

CALEB	Just no social media. No cell phone.

RAIN	You don’t have a cell phone?

CALEB	No. Otherwise I would have asked for your number. But I don't. 

STUDENT COUNCIL CANDIDATE 	Donut forget to vote for me!

RAIN	Will do.

CALEB	Nice kid.

RAIN	Where do you even learn about all of that stuff?

CALEB	You know online. You can find out anything if you know what to look for.

CALEB	It's actually pretty hypocritical of me to say...

CALEB	What are you feeling?

RAIN	Let’s go eat outside.

CALEB	Rain?

CALEB	Rain?

RAIN	Shh!

CALEB	What are you doing?

RAIN	They’re going to take me away.

CALEB	Who?

RAIN	The cops! My neighbor she called the cops on me.

CALEB	I think they’re just on patrol.

RAIN	You don’t believe me?

CALEB	I don’t know...I guess.

CALEB	But why would she call the cops?

RAIN	She needs to get rid of me. My neighbor she kidnapped a little girl and she's keeping her in her attic.

CALEB	What? Well have you told the cops?

RAIN	I told you...

RAIN	I can’t. 

CALEB	Why not?

RAIN	They’re on her side!

CALEB	Dude, this is insane.

RAIN	Yeah I know. I know. 

CALEB	Okay you're telling me that your neighbor kidnapped...

CALEB	a little girl and has her chained in her attic right now. And she called the cops on you? Do you realize how that sounds?

RAIN	Yeah.

RAIN	Yeah, I know okay but have you seen the news? I mean look at Dahmer, no one thought that think that could happen, but he had neighbors. But people are...

RAIN	they're demented!

CALEB	Okay...

RAIN	I just need you to trust me.

CALEB	I do. All right I…if this is true then you gotta...

RAIN	It’s true okay. I…I just need proof.

CALEB	All right…well maybe…maybe I can help.

CALEB	Meet me here after school. All right. We'll figure it out. 

ALEXA	Hey. Get in!

FRIENDS	Hey! (Laughter) "Your search returned about 108,500,000 results.”

DR. PANGLOSS	Hi, Rain. It’s Dr. Pangloss here. I am just checking to see if you're going to make it to your appointment today.

CALEB	Hey.

CALEB	Where are you going?

RAIN	I thought you left.

CALEB	I did I had to fill up.

CALEB	Sorry. Here. Get in.

RAIN	What am I…?

RAIN	Sorry. I kind of crushed it.

CALEB	Oh no it's actually for you. I made you a little something.

RAIN	What is it?

CALEB	Open it.

RAIN	Is it magic?

CALEB	No. You don’t like magic.

CALEB	It’s a neuron.

RAIN	Really?

CALEB	Yeah…it's like...

CALEB	It’s kind of nerdy and all, but...I guess I just like your brain.

RAIN	(Chuckles) I love it. Thanks. 

RAIN	That's her place. 

CALEB	It’s nice.

RAIN	She inherited it. Okay how are we going to do this?

CALEB	Uh…just wait I guess and watch. Figure out her schedule. 

RAIN	She works Monday through Friday, from 7 to 4, and has a night class at HCC from 7 to 11. That's going to be our prime time. What? Did you think I was just going to wait for someone else to fix this?

CALEB	We're not breaking into somebody's house!

RAIN	I need to know.

CALEB	Why can't we come back Wednesday when she's at work?

RAIN	Who knows what will happen to her by Wednesday.

RAIN	This is new, it was open before.

CALEB	Well, then lets just go. 

RAIN	We’ve got to find a screwdriver or something.

CALEB	Hey look.

RAIN	So?

CALEB	Maybe she does have a kid.

RAIN	Found one!

CALEB	What the hell Rain?!

RAIN	What?

CALEB	You said she works Monday through Friday...

CALEB	would have been helpful to mention it was at our school. It's not okay. 

CALEB	This is really bad.Is this possible?

RAIN	Walls don’t bleed. Walls don’t bleed. 

RAIN	Walls don’t bleed. (Breathing heavy)

RAIN	Mom.

MICHELLE	I'm sorry I was just...

RAIN	You scared me.

MICHELLE	I didn’t mean to.

MICHELLE	Just wanted to see what you’re seeing.

RAIN	Be careful what you wish for.

MICHELLE	So...

MICHELLE	when am I going to get to meet this Caleb?

RAIN	Probably never.

MICHELLE	Why?

RAIN	It wasn't a lie.

MICHELLE	I didn’t say it was.

RAIN	Yeah, well, I know what you’re thinking.

MICHELLE	What?

RAIN	You want to know if he’s real.

RAIN	Honestly, I don’t know if he is or not.

RAIN	I don’t care. I like spending time with him, even if he’s an illusion.

MICHELLE	It’s not healthy for you, though.

RAIN	How do you know Mom? 

RAIN	You have no idea what it’s like, to have no one to talk to. 

RAIN	I finally have someone to keep me company and he’s not hurting me. Or anyone else. So I don't understand what the problem is. 

MICHELLE	It's just…

MICHELLE	It could be a trigger. And you always have me to talk to. 

RAIN	Yeah, it's just not the same. 

MICHELLE	Why because I'm real?

MICHELLE	I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. 

RAIN	I just...I want to get better, I...

RAIN	really…I do. 

RAIN	Sometimes I'm just afraid to lose it all.

MICHELLE	I know, baby. I know.

RAIN	Hey!

RAIN	(Whispering) Let’s skip class and go back to her place.

CALEB	You’re joking, right?

RAIN	No.

CALEB	RAINI’m not about to break into my teacher's house.

RAIN	Well, you kind of already did.

CALEB	Well I’m not doing it again. (Scoffs) Can’t we just hang out and do something normal?

CALEB	Hey, let's go back to the school. 

CALEB	I have an idea. And this time it doesn't involve anything, you know, illegal. 

RAIN	I've been looking online for two weeks. You're not going to find her. 

CALEB	Well, you are severely underestimating my skills here. How old would you uh, say she was? 

RAIN	3 or 4. 

CALEB	There are so many of them.

RAIN	The world…

RAIN	is full of monsters.

CALEB	Alright, well, we're just gonna have to...

CALEB	start in on Florida. 

RAIN	Okay. 

CALEB	And then just…

CALEB	move out. 

RAIN	No. Slow down. 

CALEB	You can't even search by gender. 

RAIN	Um…okay, try like...

RAIN	Try Georgia or something. 

CALEB	Do any of these look familiar?

RAIN	Wait. Go to that one. 

CALEB	This one? 

RAIN	Yeah. 

RAIN	No. No, it's not her. 

CALEB	How about any of these? 

RAIN	No. I mean like, that kind of...

RAIN	looks like but no, that's not her. 

RAIN	Okay, go back. Try um…try South Carolina. 

RAIN	Keep…

RAIN	going. Scroll, scroll. No...

RAIN	no. No. 

RAIN	Go back. Try Alabama. 

RAIN	I tell you, she had like this really curly hair. 

CALEB	Hmm. 

RAIN	Uh-uh. 

RAIN	Try North Carolina. 

RAIN	Wait. Wait. Go back up. 

RAIN	Uh…

RAIN	Oh my god. 

RAIN	That's her. That-that's the little girl. 

CALEB	Are you sure?

RAIN	Yeah. I'm sure. 

CALEB	Malia Robinson, Missing from Pender County…

CALEB	since February. Believed to be abducted from her home. 

RAIN	Oh my god, this is-this is-you're ama--

RAIN	Oh my god! We need--we...

RAIN	need to call her parents. 

CALEB	Uh, and tell them what? 

RAIN	Tell-- tell that that we found her!

CALEB	Are you sure that's a good idea? 

RAIN	I'm like--I'm like freaking out right now. I need to grab a drink of water. I'll be--I'll be right back. 

RAIN	I'll be right back. Um, find-find her contact information, and I'll-I'll be right back. 

ALEXA	Why are you taking it out on me? I’m not the one who left. Hello? Hello? (under breath) Fuck. 

ALEXA	God.

RAIN	Is everything okay?

ALEXA	My parents. They just won't even speak to each other.  

ALEXA	(crying) I have no way of paying for college. And it's...

ALEXA	just not fair, you know. I don't want to get stuck here. It's not my fault! I-I-I feel like I can't breathe. 

RAIN	Let me help. 

ALEXA	Stop! 

ALEXA	Get away from me!

RAIN	Um, I--

RAIN	I think she’s having a panic attack. 

ALEXA	Just because you’re schizophrenic doesn’t mean the rest of us are messed up too! 

CALEB	Hey. 

RAIN	Hey. 

CALEB	It... doesn't bother me, you know. 

CALEB	I just wish you would've told me what it was. 

RAIN	They’ve diagnosed me with so many things, I don’t really know what to believe anymore. 

RAIN	If you don’t want to be friends after this, I'll understand. 

CALEB	You want to grab something to eat?

CALEB	So... I don’t want to be insensitive or anything, but what's it like? 

RAIN	What do you mean?

CALEB	You know, do you see things? Do you hear things? I don't know. I want to know everything about it, you know. 

RAIN	Okay, that’s a lot.

CALEB	I'm sorry. I'm being rude here. 

RAIN	No, it's fine. (sighs) Number one, I don’t have multiple personalities.

RAIN	A lot of people assume that, but it's completely different.

CALEB	Oh, so it's...

CALEB	just Rain.

RAIN	Well, not exactly. There's…

RAIN	a lot of voices that say the worst things that you could possibly imagine. I mean, or that I could. 

RAIN	I mean, to be honest, it gets kind of scary not really knowing if I can...

RAIN	trust what I see or hear. But, a lot of people, they don't have visual hallucinations, just auditory ones. But I have…both.

RAIN	So…

RAIN	Sorry. I know, it's kind of…weird. 

CALEB	No, it...

CALEB	it’s what makes you, you. You know, I…I'm different. You're different. Why should we have to apologize for that to anyone. 

CALEB	I don't see anyone else apologizing for having...

CALEB	diabetes or tuberculosis, you know? 

CALEB	Look…Rain, it's…it's okay if she's not real. 

CALEB	I'll-I'll see you later. 

RAIN	Yeah. Bye. 

MICHELLE	You're home late. 

RAIN	It’s only 7. Did you do anything today? 

RAIN	Mom, if I can get out and socialize, you can, too. 

MICHELLE	I’m proud of you.

JOHN	Hey, Monkey, I’ve got a surprise for you.

JOHN	Ta-da. What do you think?

RAIN	Yeah. It looks good. 

JOHN	You remember that day?

RAIN	Yeah. You and mom looked so happy.

RAIN	I think I'm going to stay in the other room for now. 

JOHN	Oh, okay. 

LITTLE GIRL	Mommy! 

LITTLE GIRL	Mommy! 

VOICE	Do something. 

RAIN	Mom? Mom, what are you doing in here? What's wrong? Is it something I did? 

RAIN	I’m sorry. I’m sorry I messed up. 

MICHELLE	No, baby. 

MICHELLE	No, it’s not you. It's not you. 

RAIN	I'm trying to be better. I promise. I'm sorry. 

CALEB	It's like taking candy from a baby right, Miss McConnell? Is anyone else reacting? 

VOICE	He's not real. 

VOICE	Rain? Rain! 

VOICE	RAIN(echoing).

CALEB	(whispering) Rain! 

VOICE	He's not real. What were you thinking? 

VOICE	This is stupid. (laughing)

DANI MCCONNELL	Don't forget to turn in your...

DANI MCCONNELL	papers if you haven't done it already. 

CALEB	Rain? Rain. 

RAIN	What are you doing here?

CALEB	You’ve been ignoring me.
RAIN	Yeah. 

CALEB	Yeah, and--I...wasn’t expecting you to admit that. 

RAIN	Yeah, well, I did. And I've been ignoring you because you're not real. 

CALEB	I am real. 

RAIN	You’re in prison. You’re a prism.

CALEB	What? 

RAIN	Okay, number one: is it possible? No. The answer is no. No one like you exists in real life. 

CALEB	What makes you think I’m not real?

RAIN	You're just too…perfect. 

CALEB	O--okay. That’s a first.

RAIN	No. That you're like...

RAIN	perfectly imperfect. I-I really don’t want to keep talking about this with you.

CALEB	Well, that's too...

CALEB	bad because now I'm not going anywhere. I mean, it's bad enough to find friends out here and much less--

RAIN	Stop. 

RAIN	You need to go, whether you're real or not. 

CALEB	I am real. And you're a little different. I don't care about that. I mean, I do--I care about it. I like you. 

CALEB	What was that? 
RAIN	Wait, you heard her? 

CALEB	I mean I heard something.

RAIN	It was Malia!

CALEB	What? It could've been a cat. 

RAIN	No. It wasn't a cat. 

CALEB	Alright, well we should call the police then. 

RAIN	I can't. 

CALEB	Why not? 

RAIN	You just said it...

RAIN	could’ve been a cat, and if I'm wrong, they'll put me away. 

CALEB	Okay, well, what do you want us to do? 

RAIN	We're good. Through here. 

CALEB	Hey. I think I'm gonna get in from the garage. 

JOHN	What's going on? 

DANI MCCONNELL	Enough is enough, John!

JOHN	Dani, what’s-what's going on? 

DANI MCCONNELL	(overlapping) It's one…

DANI MCCONNELL	thing when she’s having issues, but now she’s vandalizing  my home and making accusations that could end my career!

JOHN	Slow down. What? 

JOHN	What is--

DANI MCCONNELL	I’ve worked my ass off for my retirement…

DANI MCCONNELL	I cannot afford to have that jeopardized.

JOHN	What do you want me to do?

DANI MCCONNELL	You know what you need to do.

JOHN	No. I-I really don't. 

DANI MCCONNELL	You need…to take her in to the hospital. 

JOHN	Do…

JOHN	you want me to just lock my kid up and just sweep her under the rug? 

DANI MCCONNELL	You know, I get that you’re in a tough place, but if you’don't take her in, I'm filing charges. 

JOHN	Excuse me. Hold on a minute, Dani seriously. 

DANI MCCONNELL	No. 

DANI MCCONNELL	I'm done. I'm fine. 

JOHN	Excuse me. 

JOHN	Dani? 

DANI MCCONNELL	I'm done!

JOHN	Dani, just--

DANI MCCONNELL	Take the hint. 

JOHN	Please, just…

JOHN	I told you not to go over there. 

JOHN	What were you thinking? 

MICHELLE	John. 

RAIN	She has a giant doll house in her garage. 

JOHN	Yeah. She’s got a hundred dolls in her attic. She's weird. Who the hell cares? 

RAIN	Well, this is all part of her plan. She's gonna trap her in there.

JOHN	Are you listening to yourself? 

RAIN	That's what she...

RAIN	wants. She wants you to think I'm crazy so that she can send me away. 

JOHN	You broke…

JOHN	into somebody's house, Rain! 

RAIN	I didn't break into it. 

RAIN	CALEBbroke the window. 

JOHN	Oh christ...

JOHN	this again. No. She only reported seeing you. 

RAIN	Well, she maybe just didn't see him. But he was there. He heard her scream. 

JOHN	Caleb…

JOHN	doesn’t exist, okay? Seriously you need to stop. 

RAIN	Stop what? If I wasn't sick, you would never even be saying --

JOHN	You are sick!

RAIN	But I’m not my sickness!

JOHN	Yes…

JOHN	you are! 

JOHN	We all are! 

JOHN	You’re going to Westbrook.

MICHELLE	Don’t you dare say that!

RAIN	What? No! 

MICHELLE	I've had enough of this. You're both out of control. 

JOHN	Have you been taking your medicine?

RAIN	Yes. 

JOHN	Have you?

RAIN	It doesn’t matter what I say anyways. You don't believe me. 

JOHN	Come here. Come here. 

RAIN	Stop! 

JOHN	Come here. 

RAIN	Get off! Get your hands off me. 

JOHN	Take your medicine. 

RAIN	I’ve already taken it today.

JOHN	Take another dose.

RAIN	No! 

RAIN	Dad! Stop! What are you--

JOHN	Take it! 

RAIN	Stop! 

RAIN	What? Is this what…

RAIN	you want, Dad, huh? You want me to take them...

RAIN	all? You want me to get out of your hair for good, okay. 

JOHN	Oh my god…I'm sorry.

JOHN	Don't say that. 

JOHN	Don't ever say that again. 

JOHN	I don’t know what else I'm supposed to do. I'm sorry. 

RAIN	Sorry doesn’t make it okay.

CALEB	What are we going to do?

RAIN	Nice of you to show up after your disappearing act.

CALEB	What? You ran, I ran. That...

RAIN	Well, she called the cops. She’s filing charges to have me sent away.

CALEB	What? Where?

RAIN	I’ve gotta go to class. 

CALEB	No. If you leave, then...

CALEB	what's gonna happen to Malia?

RAIN	Oh, you mean the cat next door?

CALEB	So, what's your plan? 

RAIN	We, we can climb up the ladder and break through the windows. 

CALEB	But while she’s home? That’s not gonna do any good. She's just gonna call the cops. Get us arrested. 

RAIN	We have to do something before she kills her. What--

CALEB	What makes you think she’s going to kill her? 

RAIN	She knows that I know! She’s going to kill her and it's all gonna be my fault! And I'm gonna be the one who just didn't even do anything to save her.

CALEB	Rain.

RAIN	I can't.

CALEB	We need to come up with a coherent plan. Panicking is not gonna help. 

CALEB	Let me get you some water. Alright? 

RAIN	Wrong one. 

CALEB	You take all of these?

RAIN	Not exactly. They're constantly changing them out to see what's most effective. I can't sleep on any of them, though. 

CALEB	Studies have found strong links between insomnia and intellect so...

RAIN	I’m sure that’s what it is. Just me being a genius.

RAIN	How can you be playing cards right now? 

CALEB	Helps me when I’m nervous. Here, try it again. Pick one. 

RAIN	No. [beat] You pick one. 

CALEB	Yeah. What’re you going to do with those?

RAIN	Just pick a card. 

MICHELLE	Rain? 

RAIN	Yeah? Mom. Hi. 

MICHELLE	Oh-- I’m sorry. Who is this?

RAIN	Um, this is Caleb. Caleb, this is my mom. Wait-- you can see him? 

MICHELLE	Of course I can see him.

RAIN	I was so nervous. Never mind. 

MICHELLE	Don’t let me interrupt your date. 

RAIN	It’s not a date, mom. We’re just friends. 

MICHELLE	Mm-hmm. 

RAIN	I don't think we should wait. Let's go Wednesday after--

CALEB	You know, actually I-I…I gotta go. 

CALEB	But I'll uh…I'll see you tomorrow...

CALEB	yeah? 

RAIN	Okay. Yeah. 

MICHELLE	Did I ruin your date? 

DANI MCCONNELL	Alright, alright, guys, come on. You're late. Come on in. Take a seat. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Let's get started. 

VOICE	I told you. 

VOICE	I told you. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Rain? 

VOICE	He's not real! 

VOICE	Kill yourself! 

DANI MCCONNELL	Rain. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Whoa. Rain. Rain. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Are you okay?  

DANI MCCONNELL	Rain, can we talk for a moment? 

DANI MCCONNELL	Rain? I think you need to go see the nurse. 

VOICES	You're crazy! You're crazy! 

MICHELLE	Hi. You’ve reached the Burroughs residence. 

RAIN	Hi. I need to talk to Dr. Pangloss. 

RECEPTIONIST	She's up at the hospital, Ms. Burroughs. But I can let her know that you want to speak to her. 

RAIN	Um, no. 

RAIN	I need to see her now. 

RECEPTIONIST	She’s not here.

RAIN	Dr. Pangloss! 

RAIN	Dr. Pangloss!! 

RAIN	Dr. Pangloss!! 

RECEPTIONIST	Rain! 

CHILDISH VOICE	Rain! 

CHILDISH VOICE	Save me! 

VOICE	You're crazy. You're crazy. Get it together. 

RAINREFLECTION	She's not real. She’s going to die and you’re going to be locked up where you belong. They’re better off without you. STOP!! 

RAIN	Shut up! Shut up! 

MICHELLE	RAINhoney? 

MICHELLE	Rain? Rain, sweetheart? 

RAIN	I saw a man with yellow eyes. 

RAIN	He wants to take me as his prize. He cries, and he cries…(sobbing).

RAIN	The sound is so…(crying) 

MICHELLE	No. No…

MICHELLE	Sweetheart. Put it down. Put it down. 

MICHELLE	Okay. Alright. You're okay. You're okay. You're safe. You're safe. You're safe. You're safe. 

MICHELLE	Sweetheart, you're safe. 

RAIN	Let me up. Let me up! 

MICHELLE	No, Rain. Rain! Tonight.

MICHELLE	No. I won't let you. 

RAIN	Won't let me what, mom? 

RAIN	This is your fault in the first place! I wouldn’t be dealing with any of this if you hadn’t made me sick! I hate you.

MICHELLE	Rain, please. Please, if you go over there, they will take you away from us. 

RAIN	I don’t care! What if it was me? I’m not just going to sit here and wait! 

MICHELLE	No, Rain! 

JOHN	Rain! 

RAIN	Mom’s making a big deal out of this!

JOHN	Open the door! 

RAIN	I've got this! 

JOHN	We need to talk. Move away from the window, please.

RAIN	I'm…

RAIN	not gonna jump, Dad. I was just--

MICHELLE	Rain, listen to your dad. 

RAIN	You ruin everything!

JOHN	There's no one there. 

RAIN	Yes, she is. She's right there! 

JOHN	Your mom. She's not here. 

JOHN	She passed away three years ago, baby. 

RAIN	No. That’s not true.

JOHN	It's true. I'm sorry. 

RAIN	Why are you doing this to me? 

JOHN	I'm not doing anything to you. 

JOHN	You need to know the truth.

RAIN	What about at dinner? She was there. We were all there. Was anyone else reacting? Yes, dad. Yes, you were. You were reacting. 

JOHN	Because I was trying...

RAIN	Dad, she's coming. Nothing. Nothing going on here. 

JOHN	Look. 

JOHN	I was just trying to...

RAIN	This whole time? 

RAIN	Mom's coming to dinner. 

JOHN	I didn't know what to do though. When you started seeing her again. 

JOHN	Nothing to see here. 

RAIN	Nothing, mom.  Don’t come in.

JOHN	The coast is clear. 

JOHN	I tried to…

JOHN	remind you that she was gone, but it was really, really hard seeing you relive that loss...

JOHN	over and over and over again. 

RAIN	Yeah, mom. 

JOHN	But after awhile... 

JOHN	your reality with her was...

JOHN	was just so much--it was so much happier…

JOHN	than mine without her.

JOHN	And…I was...

JOHN	I was…I was so afraid. 

JOHN	I was just so terrified that you-that you…

JOHN	that you would want to go...

JOHN	to be with her. 

RAIN	How do I know you’re not lying to me? Huh? 

JOHN	Rain…

RAIN	How do I know you’re not just messing with my head?

JOHN	Why would I do that?

RAIN	Why would you lie to me in the beginning? Why didn't you--you’re just trying to get into my head. 

RAIN	Stop fucking with…

RAIN	my head! 

RAIN	[crying] What are you doing? 

JOHN	I’m calling 9-1-1.

RAIN	No! Stop!! 

JOHN	Rain! Come back! Oh! 

JOHN	Rain! 

DANI MCCONNELL	Malia is already dead.

VOICES	This is your fault. She's lying! Do something!  

VOICE	Mommy. 

RAIN	Malia? 

CHILD'S VOICE	Help.

RAIN	It's okay. I'm here to help you. 

YOUNG RAIN	Save me! 

YOUNG RAIN	Save me! 

RAIN	Stop. 

RAIN	No. No, you're not real. I need to save Malia. 

YOUNG RAIN	There is no Malia! 

YOUNG RAIN	It's always been me. 

VOICE	You should know yourself. 

RAIN	No, no, no, no, no, no. She's real. 

RAIN	No…no…

MICHELLE	You did this. 

RAIN	No, no...

MICHELLE	Look at me. You can't…leave me. 

RAIN	I don’t want to. I’m sorry. I don’t want you to go away.

MICHELLE	I don't have to. 

RAIN	I don’t want to be crazy, mom.

RAIN	Malia. 

MICHELLE	She’s made up, Rain.

RAIN	No, she's not, mom. You are.

DANI MCCONNELL	Hello? Is anybody down there? 

DANI MCCONNELL	Hello? 

DANI MCCONNELL	Oh! Oh...

DANI MCCONNELL	Gosh, Rain. You scared the hell out of me. Oh god. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Oh...

DANI MCCONNELL	Here, let me help you. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Here.

DANI MCCONNELL	Rain, take my hand. It’s right here. 

DANI MCCONNELL	I don't want anything to hurt you. 

DANI MCCONNELL	It's okay. (inaudible) 

DANI MCCONNELL	There's no one there, Rain. There's no little girl here. 

VOICE	Save Malia! 

RAIN	Malia! Malia! Come here, come here! 

DANI MCCONNELL	She's not…

DANI MCCONNELL	real, Rain. You made her up in your head. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Put that down. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Let me help you. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Come on. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Let me help you. 

DANI MCCONNELL	Does your dad know you’re here?

RAIN	I don't-I don’t think so. No.

DANI MCCONNELL	I don’t have to tell him. We can just keep this between us, okay?

RAIN	Why would you do that?

DANI MCCONNELL	Because I know what happens when they institutionalize people, and...

DANI MCCONNELL	I don’t want that happening to you. You have been through so much already. 

RAIN	I just don't know what to believe anymore. 

DANI MCCONNELL	You’ve seen that she’s not real. 
DANI MCCONNELL	There is no little girl. 

DANI MCCONNELL	You can just go on home, and we’ll keep this between us, okay? 

CALEB	Rain? 

RAIN	Caleb, don’t come down here.

DANI MCCONNELL	Who are you talking to, Rain? There’s no one there. 

DANI MCCONNELL	This is your...

DANI MCCONNELL	head. This…

CALEB	Go, Rain! Get her out of here! 

DANI MCCONNELL	Make…

DANI MCCONNELL	a decision, Rain. A...

DANI MCCONNELL	figment of your imagination, or the real thing. 

RAIN	No! No! 

DANI MCCONNELL	Did you think I was going to let you get away with this? I would've let you go. 

DANI MCCONNELL	I didn’t want anyone to die. But you couldn't let things...

DANI MCCONNELL	be. 

CALEB	Get her out of here, Rain! 

JOHN	Rain. 

JOHN	Hey, hey, hey. It's just me. 

JOHN	It's just me. You're safe. 

JOHN	Are you okay? 

RAIN	Dad. 

JOHN	She's real. Come on, come on, come on. 

RAIN	I'm gonna go back inside. Caleb's--

JOHN	No. Stay right here. 

JOHN	I'm so sorry. I’m so sorry. 

RAIN	I need to go back inside. Caleb-Caleb--

JOHN	No, no, no. He's not here. 

JOHN	He's not here. 

PARAMEDIC	Who called EMT? Hey, there. You alright? 

JOHN	He is real. 

SHERIFF	Hey, we got another one over here. 

JOHN	I love you. 

JOHN	I’m so proud of you, Monkey.

RAIN	Hey, it's gonna be okay. They're gonna take good care of you and get you back to your mom and dad, okay?

CALEB	Hi. 

CALEB	Hey, when you said that wasn't a date, what did you uh, what did you mean? 

CALEB	Because it felt kind of, I don't know, date-y to me. 

RAIN	Did it?

CALEB	Yeah. I mean, granted, I don’t have that much experience with that sort of thing, but…

RAIN	You mean like, dates? 

CALEB	Yeah. 

CALEB	Well, maybe we can have some more of them. 

CALEB	When I'm out of this. 

RAIN	We could maybe arrange that. 

CALEB	I'd like that personally. (laughs) 

RAIN	For the first time, I can feel the medicine working. 

RAIN	I can finally tell the difference between what's real and what's not. 

JOHN	But do you still hear the voices and...

RAIN	Yeah. They’re still there, but they’re not as like, “agahhh” (she makes an overwhelming sound). That. 

JOHN	What about mom?

JOHN	Do you still see her?

RAIN	No. 

RAIN	I miss her. 

RAIN	Hey, dad. 

JOHN	Yeah. 

RAIN	I think I'm going to move back into my room. 

JOHN	Oh. Okay. 

JOHN	Sounds like a plan.

MICHELLE	I'm here, baby girl. I love you so, so much. 

RAIN	I love you, too.
