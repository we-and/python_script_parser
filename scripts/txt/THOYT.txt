NIGEL	WELCOME ONCE AGAIN THOMAS FANS! To another wonderful day on Sodor! 
NIGEL	And here to entertain us with his outstanding knowledge of Sodor, is my good friend Stan. 
STAN	Hello, Nigel. 
NIGEL	Now Stan, I’m intrigued to find out what you have in store for us this week. STAN :: 
STAN	Well Nigel I thought we could take a look at some of the special cargo that the engines of Sodor have to carry, in particular live stock. 
NIGEL	(GASP) Do you mean animals Stan?
STAN	Indeed I do Nigel. Sodor has a large variety of animals in its large farming community, as well as lots of animals that live in the wild. 
NIGEL	Well let’s take a look at them all, shall we? 
STAN	Yes, well I think we’ll start with some feathery friends Nigel.  Here we see Thomas collecting some chickens at Farmer McColl’s farm 
NIGEL	Aw! Lovely chickens and their lovely eggs!
NIGEL	It’s that old conundrum Stan! What came first, the chicken or the egg? 
STAN	I have no idea Nigel, but here’s Cranky dropping a crate of chickens. NIGEL	Oh dear, cranky’s fouled that up hasn’t he! 
STAN	Now the engines are often tasked with collecting and delivering Farmer McColl’s prize sheep. 
NIGEL	Delightful creatures Stan, like little fluffy balls of cotton wool. 
STAN	McColl’s farm also has a fine herd of cows which supplies the island with Milk and other dairy products. 
NIGEL	And if I’m not mistaken doesn’t Farmer McColl own a prize Bull? 
STAN	Indeed he does Nigel, the same one that gave Sir Topham Hatt a little fright. 
NIGEL	Oh! My! Look at him go! I don’t think I’ve ever seen Sir Topham Hatt move that fast before. 
STAN	But you know Farmer McColl isn’t the only farmer on Sodor. 
NIGEL	Really? 
STAN	Really. There is also Farmer Trotter who runs a pig farm.
.NIGEL	How aptly named Stan, next you’ll be telling me there’s a fish farmer caller Farmer Pike
STAN	No Nigel there aren’t any Fish farmers 
NIGEL	Or not... 
STAN	But there’s also a large variety of wild animals that inhabit the island. 
STAN	There’s the very rare ‘Great Warbler’. There’s rabbits, some deer, squirrels and ducks. 
NIGEL	And Elephants! 
STAN	Yes...well, maybe in the Animal Park Nigel, but I don’t think you’ll find an elephant in the wild on Sodor. 
NIGEL	Ah-ha-ha-ha, that’s where you are wrong Stan! I’ve heard of many occasions where engines have had a run in with a wild elephant. 
STAN	Yes, but... 
NIGEL	There was that time with Henry and the Elephant that got stuck in the Tunnel 
STAN	I know, but... 
NIGEL	And that time Charlie came face to face with an elephant out on the tracks.
STAN	Yes but they were both elephants that had escaped from the Animal Park and the Circus. They don’t live in the wild Nigel. 
NIGEL	Oh... well how about the dinosuars?! 
STAN	Dinosaurs?! (worried laugh) DINOSAURS! 
NIGEL	Stan?...... Stan?! It’s just a model! How odd...he’s not normally one to overreact..
