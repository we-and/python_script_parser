GARY	I don't have a (indistinct) she's gonna take everything.

SABRINA	Previously on Sistas.

GARY	Maybe if you represented her, you could…

ANDI	The hell are you saying?

SABRINA	I was thinking about buying him something.  What do you think about this?

MAURICE	Uh-uh, he's not gonna like that.  That's for easy access.

GARY	I know how beautiful you are.  It just makes me think how different things could have been if you would have paid attention to me.

ANDI	She hasn't called me today.

KAREN	You want her to call you?

ANDI	I will refer her to another lawyer, but why hasn't she called me?

FATIMA	Mr. Bellamy would like to see you in the conference room and he said to bring your things.

ANDI	Hi.  What's going on?

BELLAMY	Do you wanna tell her?

ANDI	Will someone tell me?

BELLAMY	Well, Ms. Borders is feeling bad about pulling out of her divorce.  She feels embarrassed and humiliated.  She was gonna go to another law firm, but I convinced her she should talk to you first.

ANDI	Well, if Mrs. Borders feels like she should go to a…

BELLAMY	I agree.  She should be represented here.  That's why I told her that you had no judgments at all.

ANDI	Well, sir, I think…

BELLAMY	No judgment.

ANDI	No.

JASMINE	(sniffles)

ANDI	No judgment.  Not regarding the divorce, but the thoughts on going to another attorney is…

BELLAMY	We wouldn't hear of it.  And that's why I told you to bring your things so that you could take Ms. Borders to coffee and let her know that you're completely okay with representing her.

ANDI	Mr. Bellamy…

BELLAMY	Ms. Borders, go on.

JASMINE	Look, I know that you're the best.  You don't have to take my case at all, but please, please take this case, please.

BELLAMY	She'll be glad to.

ANDI	Let's go to my office and talk about it.

JASMINE	Thank you.

ANDI	Would you mind waiting for me there?

JASMINE	No.  No.

ANDI	I just have to talk to my boss.

JASMINE	All right.

BELLAMY	Thanks, Bob and Jack.

BELLAMY	I don't want to hear it.  You're representing her.

SINGER	All my girls hold me down, and them boys mess around, and my love life is a headache, we're going out tonight, because I'm nothing but love.

ANDI	Sir, with all due respect, I'm having an affair…

BELLAMY	Stop right now and look at this.

BELLAMY	That is his net worth.  I don't wanna hear anything from you other than the fact that you're going to represent her.  Because she gets half of that and we get one-third.

ANDI	I can't do it.

BELLAMY	Why not?

ANDI	I have to recuse myself, I can't do it.

BELLAMY	You're looking at this the wrong way.  You have all the goods on him, you have the power, just use it.

ANDI	Sir, if you are suggesting…

BELLAMY	Look, you had an affair with the guy a long time ago.

ANDI	I never said it was a long time ago.

BELLAMY	You never said anything.

ANDI	I won't do it.

BELLAMY	Then you need to walk out of that door with her.

ANDI	(sighs) Sir?

BELLAMY	This is how it will go, Andi.  You already signed her.  You're already in jeopardy of being disbarred.

ANDI	I told you the first day.

BELLAMY	No, you didn't.

ANDI	Sir, are you serious right now?

BELLAMY	I'm not threatening you.  I just want you to do your job.

ANDI	But this is not my job…

BELLAMY	I just want you to do your job and do it now, that's it.  That's all I'm asking, do your job.

JASMINE	Here.  It's yours, anyway.  I mean, this is gonna cost me an arm and a leg, so I might as well start aying now.

ANDI	I think you should keep that.

JASMINE	Please tell me that you're gonna represent me.  Helen swears by you, and I don't even trust anybody else.

ANDI	I know a great lawyer.

JASMINE	I knew it.

ANDI	What?

JASMINE	That you wouldn't do it.  I saw that look on your face when I told you I was going back to him.

ANDI	What look?

JASMINE	The look I gave millions of times when my mother went back to my father.  And I told myself a thousand times that I would never even be heard, and there I was.  He came in and said that he couldn't do this with me.  And he left.  He just walked out.  And my kids were crying, my son, he has autism, and this is the hardest on him.

ANDI	Did he say where he was going?

JASMINE	No.  Just said that it was over and that he couldn't do this anymore.  What the hell happened to counseling, to working things out?  Son of a bitch.

ANDI	I'm so sorry.  I'm sure he has his reasons.  (sighs)

JASMINE	What?  What the hell kind of reasons could someone have for walking out on their family?  What?  Some five-dollar whore who doesn't even have any respect for herself, because she wouldn't be […] I'm sorry.  Hey, I'm--I'm just so mad.  I--I should have known something was up when he came in and in tears.  I thought he was crying over us, but he was crying over her.  His whore must have upset him, I know it.

ANDI	Um…(sighs) do you have any proof?

JASMINE	No, this private detective is lame as hell.

ANDI	Give me his number and I'll see what he has.

JASMINE	Does this mean that you are gonna take on my case?

ANDI	I'll take a look at it.

JASMINE	Thank you.  Here, um, let me, uh, this is his number.

ANDI	Oh, great.  Thank you.

JASMINE	(sighs)

MAURICE	Thank you, sir.  Uh-hmm.

DANNI	Well, hello.  Damn.

MAURICE	Right.


DANNI	I, I just thought you were…

MAURICE	You say something smart.

DANNI	Something smart.

MAURICE	I am a man, you know that, right?

DANNI	What are you talking about?

MAURICE	You were gonna say you thought I was a man.  Just because I'm gay doesn't mean that I'm not a man.

DANNI	What are you talking about?  And why are you so hostile?

MAURICE	Who, me?

DANNI	Yeah, you.  I was just gonna say I thought you're the man I was interested in.

MAURICE	You were not gonna say that.  Why are you here, anyway?

DANNI	None of your business.

MAURICE	You don't have any money in the bank.

DANNI	Okay.  I'm here to see my friend.

MAURICE	Well, your friend is working.

DANNI	Oh, aren't you supposed to be, too?

MAURICE	I can't stand you.

DANNI	You want me.  Go do your damn job, negro.

MAURICE	I'm trying to.  Security.

DANNI	Hold on, hey, hold on, hold on.  You shouldn't keep the money out like that.  Later, later.

SABRINA	I'm sorry, sir.

DANNI	When did you get a poodle for a bodyguard?

MAURICE	I heard that.

DANNI	I wanted you to.  And why is he so hostile?

SABRINA	Girl, you really don't remember what happened at his New Year's party?

DANNI	Why is everybody bringing that party up to me?

SABRINA	Everybody like who?

DANNI	Like him and Zac.  I don't know, baby, she's closed, go to him.

SABRINA		Danni!  I'm sorry, ma'am.

DANNI	I have a very large deposit to make, thank you.  What, she (indistinct) what is--what's wrong with her?

SABRINA	You know I'm at work, right?

DANNI	Okay.  I think Zac came on to me last night.

SABRINA	Danni.

DANNI	What?

SABRINA	Where did you get that?

DANNI	(whispers) I didn't give him none of this, girl.

SABRINA	(whispers) I'm not talking about that.  I'm saying the weed.

DANNI	I gave him the Marley mix.

SABRINA	Oh, girl, I came on to you smoking that.

DANNI	Listen, I'm serious.

SABRINA	Look, I think he was just high, okay?  Don't read too much into it.  And whatever you do, do not tell Karen.

DANNI	Sabrina, I'm telling you he came on to me.

SABRINA	Oh, my God.  I'm telling you, he was high.  Talk to him today, now that he's sober, okay?

DANNI	Okay.  Are you saying he can only be attracted to me if he's high?

SABRINA	That's not what I'm saying, you know that.

DANNI	Then explain.

SABRINA	Look, the truth, the truth just comes out when people are sober.

DANNI	They tell the truth when they're smoking.

SABRINA	Not that […] you give him.  Why, what did he say?

DANNI	Well, first he was pissing me off, just talking about some, "You hide behind your jokes and the sexual stuff."  And then, he said I do it because I'm lonely and vulnerable.

SABRINA	Hmm.  Oh, he used the truth on you.

DANNI	What?

SABRINA	I mean…

DANNI	Oh, so now, he's telling the truth, but when he's coming on to me wasn't?

SABRINA	That's not what I'm trying to say--Danni, just talk to the man.

DANNI	You're yelling in a bank.

SABRINA	Look, find out what the truth is, now that there are no chemicals involved, okay?  Got it?

DANNI	Okay.

SABRINA	Right.  (sighs) Now, can you let me do my job?

DANNI	I need to make a withdrawal.

SABRINA	Girl, you don't even have an account here.  Let's talk about this later over drinks, okay?

DANNI	Okay.

SABRINA	Meet me at Freddy D's at 6:00.

DANNI	Okay.

SABRINA	All right.

DANNI	Fine.  Bye.

SABRINA	Bye.

DANNI	Bring my name, love you.

SABRINA	What?

DANNI	Thanks, girl.  It's on you.

SABRINA	Next.

GARY	(on phone) Okay.  You know what?  I said some things to you last night that was just stupid.  I was drinking.  I would never ask you to risk your career for me.

ANDI	Yeah.  Well, you did.

GARY	(on phone) Babe, I'm so sorry.  I'm just confused.  I know you don't wanna talk to me right now.  I'm sure this is confusing for you, too.  Please call me.  If not…

AUTOMATED VOICE	(on phone) To erase this message…

FATIMA	Ms. Barnes.

ANDI	Yes?

ANDI	Okay.  Does he have an appointment?

FATIMA	No.

ANDI	Okay.  Hold on a second.  I'll see if I can see him.  Thank you.

FATIMA	Uh-hmm.

ANDI	Hey, girl.

KAREN	(on phone) Hey, girl.

ANDI	Did you send an Aaron Harper Carter to see me?

KAREN	That's the guy that I was telling you about.

ANDI	(on phone) Oh.

KAREN	Is he there?

ANDI	(scoffs) Yeah, with no appointment.

KAREN	My gosh, he must be serious.

ANDI	(on phone) Yeah.  Definitely.

KAREN	Well, then…

ANDI	Look, between his wife and Gary's wife, I don't…

KAREN	(on phone) She came?

ANDI	Yes.  She came today.  (on phone) Girl, my boss practically forced me to take her case.

KAREN	Can he do that?

ANDI	He said that I already committed to take the case and it already puts the firm at risk.  So, yeah.  He can.

KAREN	That's messed up.

ANDI	(on phone) I'll tell you about it tonight, okay?

KAREN	Okay.  Oh, you're gonna see him?

ANDI	(on phone) Who?  Aaron?

KAREN	Yeah.

ANDI	Yes.  But I can only tell you what he tells you.

KAREN	Girl, we abiding by the rules now?

ANDI	(on phone) I know we're abiding.  Gonna hang up now.

KAREN	Sorry.

ANDI	Bye-bye.  Yes, could you send him back?

ANDI	Thank you.  I'm Andrea.

AARON	Aaron.  Nice to meet you.  Um, thank you for seeing me.

ANDI	Have a seat.

AARON	Thank you.  (breathes deeply)

ANDI	So, what can I do for you?

AARON	Uh, well, um, my wife is cheating on me, cheated on me apparently more times than I realized.

ANDI	I'm sorry.

AARON	It's fine.  Uh, this is the proof and these are her text messages and here are pictures with her and the guy, this is the--the airport, and on vacation, and, uh, I'll give her the car, and the house, uh, we can share custody of the kids as long as she continues to go to therapy, and I'm prepared to give her 1.8 million and 25 thousand a month.  What?

ANDI	It seems like you have it all worked out?

AARON	I've given this a lot of thought.

ANDI	Well, this is a great start.  But I will need to speak with her counsel.

AARON	No.  No.  She signed it.

ANDI	When?

AARON	This morning.

ANDI	Really?

AARON	Yes, I just need it filed.

ANDI	Does she have an attorney?

AARON	No.

ANDI	Was it notarized?

AARON	No.

ANDI	Well, I think she needs representation.


AARON	Why?

ANDI	She can tell a judge that you made her sign this under duress and that she had no attorney.

AARON	No.  I don't care, she won't contest it, okay?  It's--it's signed, let's just get it filed.

ANDI	(inhales deeply) Okay.  Well, in order to do that, uh, we have to get it notarized.

AARON	Do you have one here?

ANDI	Yes, we do, but I will need her present.

AARON	She can come right over.  Can we get this done?

ANDI	Yes.  But if I may ask, why are you in such a hurry?

AARON	I have one rule, and that's never cheat on me, ever.  I can deal with anything but this one.  So no, there's no going back, I want out and I want out now.

ANDI	Well, in my personal opinion, I feel like…

AARON	I'm sorry, Andrea.  I'm not a man who's unclear on his decisions.  I don't have to think about this.  Shall I bring her in?

ANDI	Okay.

AARON	Okay.  Give me 30 minutes?

ANDI	Okay.

KAREN	Hey, don't leave without paying your bill.  Fine.

KAREN	What he say?

ANDI	Yeah, he wants a divorce today.

KAREN	What?

ANDI	(chuckles) Yes, girl.  A man that knows what he wants.

KAREN	What happened?

ANDI	I'll tell you everything tonight.

KAREN	(on phone) Okay.

ANDI	That I can.

KAREN	(on phone) Girl, stop this bullshit, okay?  Bye.

ANDI	Bye.

ZAC	Hey.

DANNI	Hey.

ZAC	You good?

DANNI	I'm just busy.

ZAC	There ain't nobody here.

DANNI	I still have reports to do.

ZAC	Come on, girl, why you acting like this?  You don't wanna talk about last night?

DANNI	Oh, you wanna talk about last night?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You just have a mouthful of them.

ZAC	It was the weed.

DANNI	Oh, no.  It was just helping you be you.

ZAC	Look, I know…(sighs) I said some things that crossed the line.

DANNI	What did you say?

ZAC	You know.

DANNI	Refresh my memory.

ZAC	(sighs) Come on, Dan, you know what I said.

DANNI	I know what you said, but do you remember what you said?

ZAC	I said you need to stop hiding behind your jokes.

DANNI	Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, uh-hmm.  What else did you say?

ZAC	I also said that I was into you and then I wish you didn't push me off on your friend.

DANNI	Okay.  So you do remember.

ZAC	I do remember.  I don't need no pen to tell you that, either.

DANNI	Then why didn't you?

ZAC	I do--like, we'd be walking around here every day talking about […] everything is about […].

DANNI		What?

ZAC	I'm just saying.

DANNI	So we talking around now, right?

ZAC	I never stopped.

DANNI	If you were interested, then you should have said something.

ZAC	I wasn't interested.

DANNI	You know what, you are confusing the shit out of me, okay?

ZAC	Danni, I wasn't interested in that person you were pretending to be.  Hell, I didn't even get a chance to know you until that night.

DANNI	Well, forget it.

ZAC	Listen, that's who you are.

ZAC	That's who you should be, that's what dudes like me are into.

DANNI	You're with my friend.

ZAC	I'm not with Karen.

DANNI	You once were.

ZAC	(sighs)

DANNI	So, you and me will never have anything more than a cold-ass friendship, okay?

ZAC	I know that.

DANNI	Stop all this talk about me being beautiful, okay?  I already know that, Zac.

ZAC	So then stop watching me when I get out the shower.

DANNI	Oh, I'm gonna do that.

ZAC	Danni.

DANNI	I mean it.  Stop it.

ZAC	You know what, Danni, as long as you keep being this girl right here, we always gonna be friends.  But that girl that I met that night, don't ever let her show up, and we gonna have no problems.

DANNI	Listen, go talk to Karen.  I can't…

ZAC	No, I know.

DANNI	That girl loves you.

ZAC	I messed up, okay?  I meant that, but she ain't calling me or nothing.  So clearly, she don't feel the same way about me as I feel about her.

DANNI	Listen, I know that girl and she loves you.

ZAC	It's too bad.

DANNI	I think you should go and talk to her.

ZAC	Nah, there's no way.  She always talk down to me, always made me feel less than.  She--she was real good at that, but we go through something she don't call or text me, I'm good.

DANNI	I think you should go talk to her.

ZAC	Danni, you and me, we good.  Me and her, done.

DANNI	You should go talk to her.

ZAC	I'm not talking to her, Danni.  Damn.

SABRINA	Hey, girl.

KAREN	Hey.

SABRINA	Sorry I'm a little late.  But you think you can get me in and out before I have to go back to work?

KAREN	What are we doing?

SABRINA	Just a little touch-up.

KAREN	Girl.

SABRINA	Come on.  Just at the back.

KAREN	Okay.  Get in.  I got you.  Sit down.

SABRINA	Thanks.  Thank you.

KAREN	Of course.  I got you.  You know that.

SABRINA	So how are you?

KAREN	I'm good.  What?

SABRINA	Why haven't you called me or talked to me about Zac?

KAREN	(groans) Don't mention him, okay?

SABRINA	Okay.  But do you know where he's staying?

KAREN	What part of don't mention do you not understand?  Do you not want this hair done?

SABRINA	Okay.  Fine.

KAREN	I'm done, okay?  I'm moving on.

SABRINA	Uh-hmm.  Okay.  Girl, I wish I have what you have.

KAREN	What do you mean?

SABRINA	Me and Andi--I got that on and off switch on your heart.

KAREN	It's called protect yourself.

SABRINA	I guess.

KAREN	Don't guess, baby.  We got to do what's best for us.

SABRINA	(sucks teeth) Okay.  I'll drop him.  Did Danni call you?

KAREN	No.  About what?

SABRINA	Well, she said she wanna go out tonight.

KAREN	Oh, no.  I ain't going to that strip club.  No.

SABRINA	She didn't say nothing about no strip club.

KAREN	You know her.

SABRINA	We're overdue for a night out.

KAREN	We just had a night out.

SABRINA	Yeah, but, I mean, like, we can party and dance.  Just us girls.  No strippers.

KAREN	Fine.  What's gotten into you?

SABRINA	What do you mean?

KAREN	You love to stay home.

SABRINA	I know.  I'm just ready to go out.

KAREN	Does it have anything to do with them red panties?

SABRINA	I hate that she showed you those.

KAREN	Well, who was it?

SABRINA	Don't act like you don't know.

KAREN	I don't.  You should just, you know, ask me if…

SABRINA	Karen.

KAREN	Okay.  So he was wearing those?

SABRINA	Yeah.  I just got so turned off when I saw them.

KAREN	Well?

SABRINA	Don't act like she didn't tell you everything.

KAREN	She didn't.

SABRINA	Karen.

KAREN	Okay.  So he wouldn't come up when you pulled him up at all?

SABRINA	Uh-uh.  Does Andi know too?

KAREN	Yeah.

SABRINA	Damn.

KAREN	Girl, it's us, okay?  What'd you think?

SABRINA	I don't know.  You know, I got past the thing with him and the guy in the restaurant, especially after, you know, you told me about…

KAREN	Two dads?

SABRINA	Are you gonna tell me the story or…

KAREN	Okay.  I'm sorry.  Go on.  My bad.

SABRINA	I don't know what I'm gonna do.

KAREN	The only reason you in this mess is 'cause you didn't ask him in the first place.  So just ask him.

SABRINA	I know.

KAREN	Didn't--didn't he say be honest with him?

SABRINA	Yeah.

KAREN	Okay.  So just go out to dinner, invite him over, and ask him.

SABRINA	I don't know if he's gonna like that.

KAREN	Well, go ahead then.  Stay in the dark.  I don't care.

SABRINA	I wanna know but…

KAREN	What?

SABRINA	I just feel so judgmental.

KAREN	Well, then stay in the dark.

SABRINA	I mean, I never saw a man wear something like that.  Have you?

KAREN	(sighs) No.  Maybe he's a freak.

SABRINA		I don't know.

KAREN	Come on, girl.  Let me just do the hair 'cause I ain't got much time with you keep turning around like this.  What's wrong with you?  He do got a pretty ass though.

AARON	(sighs)

FAWN	I asked her to give us six months.

AARON	Who?

FAWN	What have I done?

MAURICE	Girl, look.

CALVIN	Hi, beautiful.

MAURICE	For me?

CALVIN	You wish.

MAURICE	Uh…

CALVIN	Hey.

SABRINA	Hi.

CALVIN	I couldn't wait to see you.

SABRINA	Thank you.

CALVIN	Oh, and, bam, got a deposit.

SABRINA	Okay.  I can process that for you.

CALVIN	Yeah.  Thank you very much.

SABRINA	I love these.

CALVIN	Yeah.  (sighs) You know, I had the greatest time last night.

SABRINA	Hmm.  Did you?

CALVIN	Yeah.

SABRINA	Hmm.

CALVIN	Wait.  You didn't?

SABRINA	Well, no.  I mean, I was just wondering.

CALVIN	What do you mean?

SABRINA	I mean, you did do all the work, so…

CALVIN	Well, because you didn't want to.

SABRINA	That's not true.

CALVIN	I mean, you just laid there while I pulled my pants down and was like, "You do all the work."

SABRINA	Well, not really.  At one point, didn't you feel me pulling you up?

CALVIN	No.

SABRINA	(chuckles) Yeah.  I was--I don't know.  You just kind of stayed on your knees for a long time.

CALVIN	I thought that's what you wanted.

SABRINA	No.  Not just that.

CALVIN	What do you mean?

SABRINA	(sucks teeth) I was just--I don't know.  I just wanted you on--on top of me, you know?

CALVIN	Oh.

SABRINA	Actually, you know what?  Actually…

CALVIN	Oh.

SABRINA	…this is not the place for that conversation, so…


CALVIN	Girl, ain't nobody here.

SABRINA	(chuckles) Well, that thing can read our lips, so…

MAURICE	I sure can.

CALVIN	That's your boy?

SABRINA	Go to your office and finish your audit.

MAURICE	I could do it right here.

SABRINA	Maurice.

MAURICE	I'm doing it right here.

CALVIN	Look, if you wanted me on top of you, you should have just said that?

SABRINA	I was pulling you.

CALVIN	(chuckles) No, you weren't.

SABRINA	Yes, I was.

CALVIN	(groans) Didn't your mama ever tell you to use your words when you talk?  I know my dad's always did.

SABRINA	Well, that's insulting.

CALVIN	Look, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  I just like to express myself.  And, honestly, when I saw you laying there, moaning and squirming, I got turned on.

SABRINA	(chuckles) Well, how was I supposed to know that?

CALVIN	What do you mean?

SABRINA	I couldn't--just couldn't tell if you were excited or not.

CALVIN	(laughs) Really?

SABRINA	Yeah.

CALVIN	Okay.  Excuse me, ma'am.  Is there a bathroom here that I can use?

SABRINA	Bathrooms are for employees only.

CALVIN	Oh.  If those cameras weren't there, I'd show you how turned on I…

SABRINA	(laughs) I am not going to the bathroom.

CALVIN	My car is right outside.

SABRINA	Okay.  Forget I said anything.

CALVIN	I'll be at your house tonight at 11:00.

SABRINA	I'm going out with the girls.

CALVIN	That's cool.  I'll be there waiting.  Oh, and come home tipsy.  I'll take care of the rest.

SABRINA	Have a nice day.

MAURICE	Girl, I love his swag.

SABRINA	Go.  Go work.

MAURICE	We closed.

SINGER	I can't help it, how I feel about you baby.

SINGER	Oh, no.

SINGER	I can't help it, how I feel about you baby.

KAREN	Hey.

ANDI	Hey.

KAREN	I was just about to come over.

ANDI	It's looking good in here, girl.

KAREN	Thanks.  Just got it cleaned up.

ANDI	How's it going?

KAREN	Good.  Just finally making some money, so…

ANDI	Congratulations.  I know this was a dream come true for you.

KAREN	Thank you.  And I could start paying you back.  Yeah.

ANDI	(gasps) Yeah.

KAREN	Yeah.

ANDI	Bitch, give me my money.

KAREN	Slowly.

ANDI	(laughs) Okay.

KAREN	Slowly.

ANDI	Okay.

KAREN	Slowly.  So what happened?

ANDI	I knew that wouldn't take long.

KAREN	Tell me please.  Please.

ANDI	(chuckles) Okay.  I can tell you this because it's public record.  They're divorced.  I filed the papers.

KAREN	Well, good for him.

ANDI	Good for you, you mean.

KAREN	What'd you mean?

ANDI	He is fine as hell.  You didn't tell me that.

KAREN	Andi.

ANDI	All right.

KAREN	Right.

ANDI	But whatever you do, don't cheat on him.

KAREN	When have I ever cheated?

ANDI	(clears throat)

KAREN	That don't count.

ANDI	Well, why doesn't it count?  'Cause you only let him put the tip in?

KAREN	Oh.  Whoa.  Would you stop please?

ANDI	I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.

KAREN	And what do you mean by don't cheat, hmm?

ANDI	This negro got his rules.  And if you break them, he's gone.

KAREN	Hmm.

ANDI	Why can't we be like that?

KAREN	'Cause we're us.

ANDI	Well, I like him.

KAREN	Well, any who, how's Gary and his wife, hmm?

ANDI	I don't wanna think about that.  I just wanna go home, get dressed, and meet you and the girls out.  Uh-huh.

KAREN	You're gonna leave him at the house?

ANDI	I just need a drink.  I wanna drink, and I just wanted time to think about this.  But he did apologize for asking me to represent her.

KAREN	Oh, did you tell him that she came to see you?

ANDI	Oh, no, girl.  I'll save that little tidbit for a face-to-face.

KAREN	Ooh.  Okay.  All right.

ANDI	All right.  So I'll meet you tonight?

KAREN	Yeah.  I'm about to go over there.  I'm almost finished here.  I just got to…

ANDI	Good.  Oh, are you gonna take a shower?

KAREN	Yeah.  I'm gonna head home first.

ANDI	Good, 'cause you smell like perm and weave.

KAREN	That also smells like money, okay?

ANDI	Speaking of money, you still owe me…

KAREN	The door.

ANDI	Okay.  Yup.

KAREN	The same one that you…

ANDI	Yeah.

KAREN	…came in.

ANDI	Got that.

ZAC	Danni.  Danni.  Danni.  Hey.  Hey.  Danni.  Danni.

DANNI	What?  What?

ZAC	Stop acting like that.

DANNI	Then go somewhere.

ZAC	I just came to tell you that you're right.

DANNI	I know.  I'm right about everything.

ZAC	Seriously, slow down.  Why are walking so fast?  Gosh.

DANNI	This slow enough for you?

ZAC	You see this girl right here?

DANNI	Uh-hmm.

ZAC	This?  I really don't like this girl, so keep that up.

DANNI	Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.

ZAC	Just came to tell you that you was right.

DANNI	I know.  And as much as I don't want to, I--I--I can't do that to my girl.  You're not getting none of this, Zac.

ZAC	Danni, can you just be serious for once?

DANNI	What do you want?

ZAC	Karen.

DANNI	What about her?

ZAC	If I see her, all right, I don't know what's gonna happen, so I feel like I should talk to her first to--you know what I'm saying?

DANNI	That's a great idea.  I wonder where it came from?

ZAC	Do you think she would wanna see me or talk to me?

DANNI	Hell if I know.

ZAC	You know what?  I don't even know why I talk to you.  Like, I don't--I don't know.  I don't know.

DANNI	Okay.  Of course, she does, all right?  No.  I don't know.  I can check.

ZAC	No.  No.  I got it.  Trust me.  I don't--just think before you move.  All right.  Now, I'm good, all right?

DANNI	You sure?

ZAC	I'm positive.  I'm good.

DANNI	Okay.

ZAC	All right?

DANNI	Okay.

ZAC	I'll meet you at home.

DANNI	Don't say it like that.

ZAC	Like what?

DANNI	Like, we building a home together.

ZAC	We are.  I pay half the rent.

DANNI	Well, I don't want you to have the wrong impression.  You're not getting half this ass, so…

ZAC	How did we get here again, Danni?

DANNI	You started it.  I don't…

ZAC	I didn't start nothing.

DANNI	Well…

ZAC	Just go.  Go.  Just go.

DANNI	I'll see you on the couch.

SINGER	I'm gonna tell it like it is, so you better tell it like it is, 'cause I'm gonna tell it like it is, so…

KAREN	What the hell are you doing here?

AARON	I texted you.

KAREN	And I didn't reply.

AARON	I know.  I needed to see you.

KAREN	I don't like nobody just showing up at my house.

AARON	I'm sorry.  But I had to tell you this.

KAREN	What?

AARON	Did you talk to your girlfriend?

KAREN	What girlfriend?

AARON	Andrea the lawyer.

KAREN	I talk to her all the time.

AARON	Did she tell you I went to see her?

KAREN	(chuckles) That's attorney-client personal.  She wouldn't tell me that.

AARON	Attorney-client privilege.

KAREN	That's what I said.

AARON	Well, it's not what you said.

KAREN	Okay.  Why are you here?

AARON	I just really need to apologize.

KAREN	Okay.  Apology accepted.

AARON	But you don't even know what I'm apologizing for.

KAREN	It don't matter.

AARON	It does to me.

KAREN	Okay.  You know what?  Do me a favor.  Don't ever come to my house again unless I invite you over.

AARON	Can you give a second to tell you why I felt so strongly that I had to come apologize face to face?

KAREN	Go on.

AARON	My wife told me she came to see you…

KAREN	Uh-hmm.

AARON	…and I was furious.

KAREN	As was I.

AARON	This isn't your concern.

KAREN	Exactly.  That's what I told her.

AARON	And you shouldn't be involved.

KAREN	Again, the correct point.

AARON	So it won't happen again.

KAREN	Okay.  So you said everything you feel you needed to say or…

AARON	Yes.

KAREN	Good.  Now leave.

AARON	Well, do you accept my apology?

KAREN	(sighs) Yes.  Now, I thank you.

AARON	What is it?  Like, why are you acting like this?  You got a man in there?

KAREN	(chuckles) And what if I do?

AARON	Then you just have to say that, okay?

KAREN	You came to my house unexpected and you expect me to be cool with it?  Explaining shit to you?

AARON	You--you're right.  I don't know how to do this.

KAREN	Do what?

AARON	This.  Date.  Like, I've been out of this thing for a long time.
KAREN	Okay.  Well, this popping up is rule 101.  You don't do that.

AARON	I don't know how to go slow.  I don't know how to pace myself or play games.  Forgive me.  Call me if you wanna talk, yeah?

KAREN	Okay.  Bye.

NARRATOR	Next on Sistas.

ZAC	Argh!

DANNI	What the hell is wrong with you?

ZAC	Can I ask you a question?  Why (indistinct)

DANNI	He's smart and--you know, and cute.

ZAC	(groans)

KAREN	How the hell did you know where I live?

FAWN	I saw him here.

KAREN	Okay.  I need you to stop…

FAWN	I saw him kiss you.

KAREN	You need to leave me the hell alone.

ANDI	(indistinct) I need an ambulance at 123 Peach Tree Road.  She's not breathing.  I need you here now.

ZAC	You know what I want?

DANNI	What?

ZAC	What you gave me last night.

DANNI	No.  You (indistinct) you're tripping.

ZAC	I got this.  Damn.

DANNI	What the hell is wrong with you?

ZAC	I can't feel my face.
