Balthazar Kane:	[00:00:30] I want them to feel as if they're really going to die. I want that. Yeah. Yeah. I wanna hear the screams of terror. [00:01:00] That's what they pay for.
Clown:	Yes.
Travis:	I got him, Mr. Kane.
Balthazar Kane:	Why so formal? Young Travis, what did we discuss?
Travis:	Um, Father.
Balthazar Kane:	[00:01:30] Much better my boy, much better. Now, what did you bring me?
Travis:	The gas cans you asked.
Balthazar Kane:	That I asked to be delivered to the vans. Hmm? Mm-mm (negative) Just put them there for now.
Travis:	I'm sorry, Father.
Balthazar Kane:	[00:02:00] It's all right, come here. You look like you lost something. Hmm? Come here. What's that? Hmm. Look at that. That's yours to keep.
Travis:	Thank you.
Balthazar Kane:	Would you like to double your money? [00:02:30] No loss, all gain. Mm-hmm (affirmative). All right, give me the coin, give me your hand, right hand, there we are. Open it. Open.
Travis:	But?
Balthazar Kane:	[00:03:00] But you're empty handed.
Travis:	Yes.
Balthazar Kane:	And what lesson have you just learned? You have just learned that nothing in this life is free. And if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. The key, young Travis, is [00:03:30] knowing where to look.
Travis:	I wanna know.
Balthazar Kane:	You wanna know what?
Travis:	Fireballs, how you do fireballs, the coin too, all of that. Teach me.
Balthazar Kane:	The art of misdirection is the power to direct the audiences' attention in one direction, one direction while making them distracted from the other.
Travis:	Can I try?
Balthazar Kane:	[00:04:00] Yes. Watch the fire. The flame will tell you when you release.
Travis:	Ow.
Balthazar Kane:	Endure the pain. To learn true magic, you must endure the pain. Do you remember my benediction? Magic, sacrifice.
Travis:	I wanna try again.
Balthazar Kane:	All right, go get my kit in the back of the tent. Hurry. (music)
Det. Lemar:	[00:06:00] Miss. Miss. I know you've been through a lot but we need to get your statement.
Tracy:	[00:06:30] Why?
Det. Lemar:	Uh, we just have some questions, a few things we need to clear up.
Tracy:	Fine. It all started with the invites, the golden tickets filled with false promises.
Big Ed:	I'm gonna make you an offer [00:07:00] you can't refuse. 1300 bucks cash, take it or leave it.
Customer:	I mean come on, man, these are Grable. She was box office gold like 12 years running.
Big Ed:	Right, that's why I just offered you 1300 bucks cash, take it or leave it, instead of kissing you on the mouth and feeding you to the fishes. Let me just explain something to you about business. Grable was a huge star, when? 30's and 40's. Which means all of her fans are what? Dead. Which means I'm gonna be holding [00:07:30] onto these until I'm dead, so it's $1300, take it or leave it.
Customer:	I mean these were my grandma's, dude.
Big Ed:	Why don't you give them back to her?
Sammy:	Special delivery.
Big Ed:	Is that you Mr. McFeely?
Sammy:	How's your ticker?
Big Ed:	If I had a heart, it would be fine. That's junk. Has anybody ever told you, you bear a remarkable [00:08:00] resemblance to Sammy Davis, Jr.
Sammy:	I'll talk to you later, freak.
Big Ed:	I'm not a freak. I'm Batman. Nice.
Customer:	All right dude, 1300 bucks.
Big Ed:	Are you still here?
Customer:	Yeah I'm still here, give me the money.
Big Ed:	All right, all right, all right. But I feel inflation [00:08:30] has brought that number down to a thousand dollars.
Customer:	You can't be serious, dude. (laughs) I mean 20 seconds ago, you just said it was 1300 bucks.
Big Ed:	Tick tock.
Customer:	All right man, give me the money.
Big Ed:	You drive a hard bargain.
Customer:	You're a monster.
Big Ed:	[00:09:00] I'm a capitalist, just ahead of the curve.
Customer:	You're a dick.
Big Ed:	I'm Batman.
Balthazar Kane:	Greetings and salutations, my lucky victims. You have been invited to attend a resurrection and rebirth of the greatest show on Earth. Let's get this party started, my little guinea pigs. ( [00:09:30] laughs) Let the games begin!
Big Ed:	Yeah!
Doorman:	Roxie.
Roxie:	Hey man, how's it going?
Doorman:	Very well thanks, I haven't had to, uh, eject any delinquents into orbit.
Roxie:	It's fucking loud in here.
Doorman:	Yeah. These guys are hectic. How's your brother?
Roxie:	He's all right. He's at home with the sitter.
Doorman:	Yeah, [00:10:00] I understand.
Roxie:	Yeah.
Doorman:	Well, enjoy yourself.
Roxie:	All right, catch you later.
Doorman:	Absolutely. (music)
Girlfriend:	This is the third time this week that you missed dinner so that you could go hang out with your friends!
Greg:	[00:10:30] Yeah. And it's the third time you've yelled at me for the same fucking thing every time. Yeah, third time-
Girlfriend:	I don't understand why. Are they more important than me?
Greg:	No, they're not more important than you.
Girlfriend:	Of course, they're not more important than me.
Greg:	I've been here fucking every day this week, and it doesn't fucking matter.
Girlfriend:	No you're not, you have checked out. You don't even ... You're looking at your phone right now! You [00:11:00] do not care about me at all. What are you doing? Where do you think that you're going? Listen to me. Greg? Okay. We're about to be done, if you don't get off. This has got to end. (music)
Billy:	You can run, but you can't hide. Look at you now, son, now I got to pee [00:11:30] on you. Look at you. Quarter million dollars? Balthazar Kane. Somebody's messing with me. Quarter million dollars, oh, I can do this. I can, with my boy Balthazar Kane, yes sir, yes sir, I'm, I'm in. (music)
Tracy:	[00:12:00] We didn't know the evil we were getting ourselves into. We just thought for once we were the lucky ones.
Scott:	[00:12:30] Hey, I'm Scott.
Roxie:	Roxie.
Big Ed:	Oh, are we doing introductions? I'm Eddy England, from Big Ed's Hoarder Heaven, but you little kiddies and you too, can call me Ed, or Eddie, or Stallion. But I'm sure you've heard of my place, right? Collector's Paradise on Third and Main.
Billy:	I, [00:13:00] I know that place. It, it, it's sick.
Big Ed:	Dude, next time you come in you're getting a 3% discount on a purchase of a hundred dollars or more. That goes for any of you.
Carrie:	Carrie, it's a pleasure.
Jake:	Jake.
Greg:	I'm Greg.
Tracy:	Hi guys, I'm Tracy.
Big Ed:	I'm sorry. I just want to know if anybody's interested, I just got in a mint collection of vintage photographs of Grable from the 30's and 40's.
Scott:	Who?
Big Ed:	Grable. She's an actress [00:13:30] from the 30's and 40's. She was the dancer. 
Scott:	I'm a young person dude, so ...
Tracy:	Anyway, hi, I'm Tracy. I take it we all got that creepy golden ticket invitation.
Scott:	Yep.
Big Ed:	Yup.
Carrie:	So are we all secretly related?
Roxie:	Never say never. Why do you ask?
Carrie:	Just wondering how we all won the lotto, sweetheart.
Tracy:	Fuck, I am out.
Big Ed:	I [00:14:00] love it, I love it. I love it, I love it.
Billy:	Hey, [inaudible 00:14:08]
Big Ed:	Love it.
Billy:	It's Kane, right? Kane.
Tracy:	I'm not going.
Male:	Clown. Clown man.
Roxie:	Geez.
Big Ed:	Love it.
Roxie:	Chill out, dude. Oh, God.
Big Ed:	I'm going. I'm going. Mr. Clown.
Male:	Oh, my God.
Jake:	We can't even [00:14:30] see out of this thing, how are we supposed to know where we are?
Roxie:	Quit complaining. It's creepy but kind of sweet. That's the adventure.
Scott:	Yeah, it's all right.
Big Ed:	Oh, my God. These are original posters.
Billy:	I got that one right there.
Big Ed:	Dude, I just met you, I'm sure you don't have an original poster. When you have an original poster you have a different aura.
Billy:	Don't tell [00:15:00] me what I got.
Jake:	Hey did you guys, uh, get a schedule with your invitation, 'cause mine just came with a time and place.
Tracy:	No idea. I know as much as you guys do.
Greg:	Yeah. I'm in the same boat unfortunately.
Tracy:	Yeah.
Balthazar Kane:	Good questions one, good questions all. Welcome, my friends, to the Circus Kane Afterbirth Party Ball. You're here as my very, very special guests. And I have spared no expense for you. [00:15:30] Only the best. Like the phoenix rising from the ashes, this dirty bird arises new. An adventure of horrors are built just for you. Thrill and recoil at my new masterpiece. You'll all be part of my legacy. Alive, or deceased. A reviewer, a blogger, a collector, a scream queen, a gamer, a rocker, and a [00:16:00] blogger and a teen. You make up every aspect of the horror community. I've selected you all for this very, very horrible opportunity. Now spread the word as much as you can. For your audiences will never hear from your worthless mouths again! (laughs) Hello, piggy, piggy, piggy, let's [00:16:30] play.
Big Ed:	Ahh. The classic Kane. It's classic freakin' Kane!
Tracy:	Wait. You've seen this one before?
Big Ed:	Oh, my God. Yes, I've seen this before, you dumb. This guy is like king of the traveling horror show. Oh, please don't tell me that none of you have ever seen his shows before?
Scott:	Nope.
Roxie:	No.
Jake:	Nope.
Carrie:	Um, no. Mm. I mean I've heard him mentioned by a few older shlock horror directors as inspiration when I used to act, but never actually [00:17:00] myself.
Big Ed:	Oh, my God, I thought I recognized you. You're the scream queen. You were in Night Terrors.
Carrie:	Guilty.
Jake:	Yeah, yeah, that is you. I did a review on that movie. Movie sucked, but you're okay I guess.
Big Ed:	No, no, no, no. You were amazing. Ama- Trust me. From the bottom of my heart, you were amazing. Oh, I worship you.
Roxie:	So we were all selected from our fan bases?
Jake:	That's viral marketing at it's finest. He [00:17:30] just wants us post about him. I mean who here doesn't have a shit ton of followers? Raise your hands if you don't.
Scott:	My Instagram's good as fuck.
Jake:	See what I mean?
Big Ed:	No, no. I mean he's right. I mean we're all picked because we're influential in the horror community. Like he just wants to get everybody hyped about his return.
Billy:	I've known about Kane for years. I even have his old comic book, Circus Kane's Lurking Terrors. (laughs)
Big Ed:	God, I love that comic book. Dude, tell me you still have it, is it mint?
Billy:	No. See, what [00:18:00] happened was, um, you know, I was off doing my thing. I mean my Momma she went and sold it, and, uh, you know-
Roxie:	There was that song about him.
Big Ed:	You let your Mom sell your comic book?
Billy:	Hey, don't talk about my mom.
Roxie:	There was that song about him, right? That, that Clown Killers single, Burn in ...
Greg:	Insane. Yes, yes, that's it.
Roxie:	Yeah.
Greg:	Uh, it was college. I don't know. It helped me study.
Big Ed:	Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing here, Einstein? I mean we all have some sort of, you know, reference to Kane, what's your deal?
Scott:	Thank you, medium-sized Ed. Actually, [00:18:30] the reason I'm here is 'cause I'm not scared as shit so I know I'm gonna win. Also, I need the money 'cause I owe some people.
Carrie:	Who doesn't need $250,000?
Big Ed:	You know what? All I care about is getting my poster signed. Once he signs them, they're gonna be worth like a hundred times what I paid for them.
Billy:	Why is that? You plan on killing him?
Big Ed:	No, dude. I'm not the killer, Kane's the killer.
Scott:	Oh, shit. He killed somebody?
Roxie:	For real?
Big Ed:	Yeah.
Greg:	Yeah. I think I read something about him having some pretty bad legal [00:19:00] problems.
Big Ed:	Yeah, if you want to call legal problems burning a man to death, then he had legal problems.
Tracy:	Seriously, what are you talking about? Damn. That's like the song.
Greg:	The burning man, that's right.
Big Ed:	Yeah. You guys know the song, right? Come on. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. This is the ballad of Balthazar Kane who burned to [00:19:30] a crisp now he's gone insane. Killer of love by Valentine's name. Burnt to a jail to live out his shame. Born of the madness due to the pain. Back from the dead to play out his game. Run little children when you hear his name 'cause there's nowhere to hide. Ahh. From the Circus Kane. (laughing)
Roxie:	Wooh. (laughs)
Greg:	That was it.
Roxie:	Oh, my God. That's wonderful.
Tracy:	Wow, that [00:20:00] was wonderful.
Male:	Out now! (music)
Greg:	So this is it?
Tracy:	Yeah. How long was [00:20:30] I out for?
Greg:	I don't know. I was asleep, too.
Tracy:	I think everyone was.
Roxie:	They gassed us.
Greg:	[00:21:00] They what?
Roxie:	I think they gassed us.
Greg:	Don't be ridiculous.
Male:	Move! Stairs, now!
Roxie:	I saw the green gas.
Greg:	Yeah. Lay off the drugs, punk. There must be no one around for miles.
Tracy:	I guess it's all just a part of the experience [00:21:30] huh?
Jake:	Kane couldn't have picked a more perfect place.
Roxie:	It's huge, this place is rad.
Carrie:	Creepy.
Scott:	Talking about the house or the way Big Ed's been looking at you?
Big Ed:	This was totally worth being drugged or gassed or whatever he did to us.
Pale Man:	[00:22:00] Welcome one, welcome all, to the new and improved Circus Kane. Enter, if you dare.
Billy:	Sure thing, Lurch.
Greg:	Into the haunted mansion we go.
Carrie:	I don't like the way this looks.
Jake:	Let's do this.
Roxie:	All [00:22:30] right.
Big Ed:	Are you ready? The circus is about to begin. (laughs)
Scott:	This is gonna be the easiest money I ever made.
Tracy:	What the fuck? Hey, where did they go?
Pale Man:	Good [00:23:00] luck.
Scott:	Look inside to see your fate. Hmm. You think it's a two-way mirror?
Greg:	No, it's too old for that.
Female:	[inaudible 00:23:21] (Screaming) (laughing)
Scott:	That was nothing, guys.
Greg:	[inaudible 00:23:28] what he did.
Scott:	Nothin'.
Billy:	I've seen that [00:23:30] gag a hundred times.
Tracy:	Hey, are you okay?
Big Ed:	Yeah, I'm fine.
Scott:	Yo, can I have one of those?
Big Ed:	You don't want one of these, this is medicine. I've got a bad heart.
Scott:	What, did you do a little too much blow there, Big Ed?
Big Ed:	I just wasn't expecting a jump scare. That's all.
Billy:	Who comes to a haunted house not expecting jump scares?
Big Ed:	I'm here to face my fears. (laughs)
Roxie:	[00:24:00] Shall we? (music)
Male:	Lead the way.
Male:	Yeah.
Roxie:	Yeah.
Male:	After you. (music)
Roxie:	Ooh, that was so scary. They're gonna have [00:24:30] to do way better than that or we're all going home with 250 large, cha-ching. In my bank account.
Carrie:	Hawaii here I come.
Scott:	I bet you Big Ed doesn't make it 20 more minutes.
Big Ed:	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I was just faking my heart condition to psyche you out, OB.
Scott:	Yo, yo, yo. Don't shit your pants and die, old man. (laughs)
Billy:	I'm hungry. When do we eat?
Roxie:	Figures.
Billy:	Uh, I'm a growing [00:25:00] boy.
Roxie:	No, you're not.
Jake:	Now this is getting interesting.
Carrie:	These photos are horrific.
Jake:	I think you mean "awesome."
Roxie:	It's like they're just meat.
Tracy:	Aren't we all?
Billy:	This is gonna look great on my site.
Greg:	Huh, that's interesting, I have cell service. It doesn't exactly fit the whole abandoned haunted house cliché, does it?
Jake:	I'm telling you man, it's all for promotion.
Greg:	You think?
Jake:	Yeah.
Roxie:	Isn't [00:25:30] he full of surprises?
Balthazar Kane:	Hello, my marvelous little martyrs and my little piggies. Let's get this slaughterhouse officially started. But, before we begin, I want to have something to remember you by or should I say, to identify the corpse with. (laughs)  Now, if you'll notice, [00:26:00] in the corners of all the rooms you'll see these red lights. These, my little piggies, are cameras that are there to record every delicious moment of your demise. I'll broadcast these videos to all of your fans and to all of your followers after your journey has ended. So, your descent into madness and hell can be shared with [00:26:30] the world. I would like you to share on social media, to all of your little parasites. It's for all the world to see.
Jake:	I told you guys, you see?
Roxie:	Yeah, yeah. We get it dude, shut up already.
Balthazar Kane:	All the game, who can survive the Circus Kane! And your roles as my disciples of pleasure and pain. If you're too weak and you can't take the heat just ask for mercy [00:27:00] with the words, "Balthazar Kane, you win again!" And you are free to leave ...
Big Ed:	Big Ed never taps out.
Balthazar Kane:	But if you do, you go home empty-handed. But if you make it all the way through, you go home $250,000 richer. Now, [00:27:30] I doubt that any of you will make it all the way through, and I am quite confident in what I have in store for you. This mansion has been in my family for generations, and it contains the vengeful dead of centuries. And all of it is wired from top to bottom with cameras so that you'll never, ever be truly alone. Now, as you travel through [00:28:00] the lost shadows of my home, you may bump into my little friends here and there. But (laughs) let courage be your muse, and explore at your own peril. And I promise you nothing less than the most terrifying night of you're miserable, little lives. Release [00:28:30] your inner monsters inside and let darkness be your guide. (laughs)
Big Ed:	Brr, zoinks. Thelma, I think it's time we look for clues. (laughs)
Roxie:	Do we get a Scooby snack if we find one?
Big Ed:	Rooby roo!
Roxie:	Stupid.
Jake:	Hey, that door just opened.
Roxie:	[00:29:00] Looks like a magic room.
Billy:	Any fool can see that.
Jake:	Come on, guys.
Greg:	What just happened?
Scott:	Let me try.
Jake:	What the fuck? Hey, open the door.
Scott:	It's locked.
Jake:	Come on guys, open the door.
Greg:	We have to get in there.
Jake:	Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no. Open the door. Come on, guys. Open the fucking door.
Billy:	I'm sure he's fine.
Roxie:	Do something. He doesn't sound okay.
Jake:	Hey, open the fucking door! Open the fucking door!
Roxie:	Try harder.
Greg:	We have to get in there.
Jake:	[00:29:30] Fuck. No, no! Open the fucking door!
Billy:	Let me. There you go. You loosened it up for me. Whoa!
Greg:	Oh, Jesus.
Male:	Oh, it's [00:30:00] just ... (music)
Carrie:	What's going on?
Scott:	Oh, this is ... This is a gag, guys. This is nothing.
Billy:	This is Kane. (laughing)
Scott:	See, it's nothing.
Greg:	[00:30:30] He doesn't think it's funny.
Jake:	[inaudible 00:30:56] Help me! [inaudible 00:31:22]
Scott:	Where'd he go?
Billy:	Oh, he's good.
Greg:	Guys, I think we should help him. Is that a real chainsaw?
Billy:	No.
Scott:	Oh, shit.
Greg:	No, that's a real chainsaw. [inaudible 00:31:56] He's actually killing him. He's actually killing him!
Roxie:	That's real!
Greg:	No, no. Jake, Jake!
Clown:	(laughing)
Greg:	All right, [00:32:00] we have to get out of here.
Scott:	Chill.
Greg:	This is not good.
Carrie:	I'm calling the police.
Billy:	No, no. Don't be ridiculous.
Carrie:	That clown just murdered Jake. I'm not going to be next.
Billy:	[00:32:30] Put the phone down. Look, look, we just met this dude, guys. I mean seriously, all Jake would talk about was posting on social media. This is scaring people 101, right? He always have a plan. Sure, this guy they let him cozy up to us for a little bit, right? And then the next thing you know, uh, uh, he, he's, he's over there. They've obscured his view from us a little while while they set up the gag.
Big Ed:	I hate to agree [00:33:00] with anybody in this room, but dude, you are absolutely right. Yeah, dude. I mean listen. I used to see Kane's shows back in the 80's, and I saw this one where he'd take a random audience member and he'd offer him $10,000 to cross this tightrope. And when the guy would get about halfway across the tightrope, he'd shake it, and then the guy would fall off and get impaled by a spike, it was awesome. But I saw the show 10 times, and every time I saw the show, [00:33:30] exact same audience member, exact same fall, exact same spike, and that's right when we had the fire 20 years ago. You know the burning man, we all thought it was just a big freaking Kane joke.
Billy:	I can't believe you guys haven't seen this trick a million times.
Big Ed:	(laughs)
Billy:	Think about it. It's obvious if you think about it. Jake is working with Kane.
Big Ed:	Yup.
Roxie:	I guess you're right, I mean, we are at a haunted house attraction. They are supposed to be scaring us, right?
Big Ed:	Let's just go check out the next room.
Scott:	[00:34:00] It's all right man, come on.
Billy:	Nice try, Spooky the Clown.
Scott:	Yeah.
Billy:	I just saved you guys 250 G's.
Big Ed:	[00:34:30] Both doors are locked.
Greg:	So where do we go now?
Carrie:	Maybe there is a hidden message in the video.
Billy:	Well, it's not like we can see that in here.
Carrie:	That guy filmed it.
Scott:	I have a name, you know?
Big Ed:	Yeah. It's Marky Mark.
Scott:	Hey, man. That's a compliment. He was the voice of a generation.
Carrie:	Can we see the video?
Scott:	Sure.
Balthazar Kane:	Well, hello [00:35:00] my marvelous little martyrs.
Big Ed:	It's looped.
Tracy:	What? What is that supposed to mean?
Big Ed:	It's looped, i- it's a, it's a different voice playing over an old Circus Kane commercial from the 90's.
Greg:	How could you possibly know that?
Big Ed:	Dude, I play these commercials all the time in my shop, Big Ed's Hoarder Heaven on Third and Main. Everything is different except the last line. The last line is the same in the old commercial and the new commercial. Let the darkness [00:35:30] guide you. I think that's a clue.
Carrie:	What does that mean?
Big Ed:	I'll tell you what it means. I have no idea what it means.
Roxie:	You're a genius. Black lights?
Tracy:	Guys, look.
Greg:	Okay. [00:36:00] Nothing. Got something.
Tracy:	Is there anything in there?
Greg:	I'm checking. Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a key.
Tracy:	I'll take that, thank you. [00:36:30] All right guys, let's get out of here.
Billy:	That was easy.
Roxie:	Yeah, because you didn't do anything.
Scott:	Whoa.
Carrie:	What reeks?
Tracy:	Shit, it's locked.
Scott:	[00:37:00] We'll look for some more arrows or something.
Roxie:	God, it looks so real. Even the smell.
Greg:	Ugh.
Roxie:	You don't think ...
Greg:	Oh, it's moving.
Scott:	It's trying to say something.
Balthazar Kane:	My little piggies, you're doing so swell climbing deeper into hell. You will need to find the key to set me free. You are the apple of my [00:37:30] eye. (laughs) Goodbye.
Billy:	This is easy, we just gotta find the key.
Greg:	Well, it's a small room. Let's start looking.
Scott:	Nothing over here so far.
Big Ed:	I found something.
Tracy:	[00:38:00] What makes you say that?
Big Ed:	Th- the bear and an apple. The apple of my eye. Does anybody have a knife?
Scott:	Actually, I got one.
Big Ed:	Wouldn't have expected Marky Mark to be a Boy Scout.
Scott:	Oh, it's 'cause I'm wicked smart Big Ed, wicked fuckin' smart.
Big Ed:	Say hello to your mother for me. There's something in here. Say hello [00:38:30] to my little key. Anybody wanna try it out? It's the key to my heart, don't break it.
Scott:	You would have a little key, Big Ed.
Carrie:	It doesn't work.
Big Ed:	What do you mean it doesn't work?
Carrie:	I mean it's too small, it doesn't fit.
Billy:	She literally just said that.
Big Ed:	I've never had that problem, but we're trying to solve riddles here.
Billy:	You know, for a haunted house attraction, this place has more riddles than it does scares.
Scott:	Wait hold on, let me see that key. [00:39:00] That's 'cause this goes to a padlock.
Carrie:	How did you know that?
Scott:	I used to steal shit, that's why I, I owe people money and I'm here. Dope.
Roxie:	Now what, genius?
Scott:	Well, okay, here goes nothing. Ah, [00:39:30] this, this is not real. It's not.
Tracy:	Mmph.
Female:	Oh, God.
Big Ed:	Oh, yeah!
Scott:	Oh, God.
Roxie:	It stinks.
Scott:	Okay. Hold on, there's something in here.
Roxie:	What is it?
Scott:	I can't find it. Oh, God. Oh, it's just a speaker. Whoa. There's nothing. There's no key or anything.
Tracy:	[00:40:00] It's in the eye.
Scott:	That's really gross.
Big Ed:	Well who wants to try out that theory?
Scott:	Somebody help me out. Come on. Come on. Wanna help me out?
Greg:	Nope.
Roxie:	Seriously, nobody?
Billy:	I'm lactose intolerant.
Greg:	Yeah. Nope.
Roxie:	Fine, I'll do it. All right.
Scott:	I knew I liked you.
Roxie:	Ugh. [00:40:30] Oh, God.
Big Ed:	That's awesome.
Roxie:	Ahh.
Scott:	Oh, there we go. There we go.
Big Ed:	(laughs)
Roxie:	There's the key.
Billy:	Get the key.
Roxie:	Ooh, it's slimy. Come on. Let's get the fuck out [00:41:00] of here.
Male:	This room creeps me out. Oh, God.
Tracy:	What was ahead of us was the worst things anyone could ever imagine. It was the depths of hell and we were going in willingly.
Big Ed:	And we got a demon.
Billy:	[00:41:30] What the hell. That's not cool.
Big Ed:	And two rooms.
Roxie:	More obstacles, 'cause that's not annoying.
Big Ed:	Like for sure. What's a matter? Don't you have an app for that? Bring it on matter. (laughs)
Roxie:	Do you think you're funny? Just wondering 'cause it's sad.
Scott:	That's a good one.
Carrie:	Hey. Don't I know you? Ah. You were in Night [00:42:00] Terror with me. Did you audition for that?
Greg:	It is a ticket booth. Maybe we should take a ticket.
Tracy:	That's a really good idea. Hi. Seven tickets, please. Um ...
Carrie:	[00:42:30] Two.
Greg:	I'm a one.
Billy:	One.
Scott:	Two.
Big Ed:	I'm a two, too.
Tracy:	I'm a one.
Greg:	So I guess we should go to the door that corresponds with our cards?
Carrie:	Yeah. Sounds about right.
Scott:	Hey, um, bro, could I, uh, could I switch with you? I think that, you know, I'd be better in this group so ...
Roxie:	[00:43:00] We're good here. You should probably help out grandpa.
Scott:	Really? Because I'd really like to [crosstalk 00:43:03]
Billy:	Dude, she said no.
Carrie:	Ah. Please help me Obi-Wan, you're our only hope.
Scott:	Wow, that's a really old reference.
Big Ed:	Oh, my God. You people live in caves.
Roxie:	Check out those photos. Look at the clowns. Each one they go down. [00:43:30] I think we're supposed to open the doors at the same time.
Billy:	How did you get that?
Big Ed:	Three, two, one.
Greg:	On one, at the same time.
Carrie:	Knob in hand, good to go.
Greg:	Three, two, one. Oh, God dammit.
Carrie:	Oh, Jesus. It's hot in here.
Scott:	Maybe it's because you're here.
Big Ed:	Thank you.
Billy:	That looks dangerous.
Tracy:	What? Shit. [00:44:00] What the hell are we supposed to do with this?
Roxie:	Check it out. Follow the yellow brick road?
Greg:	I guess.
Scott:	Uh, okay. Had a ... We got stumps, what do we do?
Carrie:	I imagine we have to hop across them.
Scott:	That's ridiculous. Why wouldn't we just walk around them?
Big Ed:	Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Ah!
Scott:	Are you okay?
Big Ed:	Ah! [00:44:30] We can't walk across it. The floor's super-heated. Ah.
Scott:	Fuck, oh, I'll go first.
Greg:	All right, I guess I'm going first.
Roxie:	Would you care to?
Tracy:	That's all you, girl.
Scott:	What's that sound? Oh, fuck!
Big Ed:	[00:45:00] What happened?
Scott:	Oh, oh, God.
Big Ed:	What happened?
Scott:	Th- that fucking thing cut me.
Big Ed:	This is like really dangerous.
Scott:	No fucking shit. It's fucking real.
Big Ed:	I guess $250,000 makes it worth the risk.
Scott:	Yeah. So I guess, uh, I'll time it. Ah, fuck!
Big Ed:	Be careful.
Scott:	[00:45:30] Ah.
Roxie:	Those look really sharp.
Billy:	These are sharp, guys. Be careful.
Greg:	Crawl through.
Roxie:	Let's do this.
Tracy:	Shit.
Carrie:	Don't you think this is a little fucked up to do to people?
Big Ed:	[00:47:00] Be careful. Ah! The walls are heated.
Roxie:	Come on, let's go.
Billy:	Hold [00:48:00] on.
Greg:	Here. Here. Now, give me your jacket. All right, just hold onto this and just slide through, like a penguin.
Billy:	What?
Greg:	Keep your head down. I'm gonna pull you through and you just slide right on through. One, two, three.
Billy:	Ah, stop, stop!
Roxie:	Billy, are you okay?
Billy:	Hell no. I ain't okay, I'm hooked.
Roxie:	Can you go back?
Billy:	No, [00:48:30] I can't move, dammit.
Roxie:	What do we do?
Tracy:	I don't know.
Greg:	We, we pull.
Billy:	No. What?
Tracy:	What?
Greg:	We pull him through.
Billy:	No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Roxie:	Come on. It's probably ... It's not that bad. It's just your shirt mostly.
Billy:	It's not my shirt. It's my skin. How do you know?
Roxie:	Stop being such a pussy.
Billy:	I'm not!
Tracy:	You sure?
Greg:	Do you take your band-aids off fast or slow?
Tracy:	Fast.
Greg:	Me, too.
Billy:	Ahh. Oh, God. Mommy.
Greg:	There you go, big man.
Billy:	[00:49:00] Son of a bitch. You could've killed me.
Roxie:	Easy, easy. You're okay.
Tracy:	Hey, it's not even that bad. And it's over now, okay?
Billy:	Seriously?
Tracy:	[inaudible 00:49:10] right.
Roxie:	Come on. I've had periods with heavier flows.
Billy:	Fine. Let's just get out of here. But you stay away from me. You understand?
Tracy:	Let's just make it out of this alive, okay guys?
Scott:	Come [00:49:30] on, guys. You okay? No! It's [00:50:00] locked.
Carrie:	There's no way out.
Scott:	This. No, okay.
Big Ed:	Look for a mallet.
Scott:	I don't see anything, just a bunch of bears. Should we ... Should we [00:50:30] ask for a hint or ...? I don't see anything. There!
Big Ed:	Yes! Kane, can we have a hint?
Carrie:	Look.
Scott:	It's locked.
Big Ed:	It's a jack in the box. Look for a crank. [00:51:00] They have little cranks. They have little cranks. Crank those. I hear something. Don't stop. Something's happening.
Scott:	Nothing.
Big Ed:	Ahh. Oh.
Scott:	Where'd he go? He's [00:51:30] gone.
Roxie:	This place looks like my grandma's house.
Greg:	So you've inherited her good taste.
Roxie:	Eat a dick.
Tracy:	All right, enough. [00:52:00] Can you guys just put your differences aside so we can work together and figure this out? Come on, look around. Find some clues or something.
Billy:	Look at this.
Roxie:	Seems kind of obvious, right?
Greg:	It's locked. Looks like we need another key.
Tracy:	Well, isn't that [00:52:30] wonderful?
Billy:	Well, it's got to be here, so everybody spread out. I'll start in this pile right here. I'll take this pile.
Roxie:	Fucking hate clowns.
Tracy:	Honestly, who doesn't?
Roxie:	Did [00:53:00] you see that?
Tracy:	See what?
Roxie:	Its fucking eyes moved.
Tracy:	What?
Billy:	What? Ahh. God! Oh, God!
Female:	(screaming) Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Roxie:	What the fuck. It's bite your finger out. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Greg:	[inaudible 00:53:16] He's bleeding.
Billy:	It bit me. It bit me. It bit my finger. I wanna go home. I, [00:53:30] I didn't sign up for this. It's 250 G's, it's not worth this.
Greg:	Kane, let us out. We're done.
Roxie:	Guys, I know it's fucked up, but I think I'm gonna stay.
Greg:	What?
Billy:	What? Are you mental? You see what he did to me? He bit off my finger. You wanna lose some fingers?
Roxie:	No, I don't, [00:54:00] but I'd rather lose a finger than lose my little brother. They're gonna take him away from me if I don't bring in some cash.
Greg:	Then help us find the key. We still need a key to get out of this room.
Tracy:	I've got it. I've got. I've got the key!
Greg:	Here, here.
Tracy:	Here.
Greg:	Must've done something right. Nothing's happening.
Billy:	I wanna get out.
Tracy:	What?
Billy:	[00:54:30] I want to go back to my basement!
Tracy:	Why isn't anything happening?
Greg:	Nothing's happening.
Tracy:	Oh, my God.
Roxie:	It's not working. Come on.
Billy:	Let me out of here!
Roxie:	Come on, come on!
Billy:	Let me out!
Greg:	The words, what did, what did Kane say in the video? The, the words that we have to say if we wanna leave.
Tracy:	Okay. It was, um, Balthazar Kane.
Billy:	Balthazar Kane!
Tracy:	Balthazar Kane.
Billy:	What?
Tracy:	Balthazar Kane, you win again.
Greg:	Balthazar Kane, you win again.
Billy:	Balthazar Kane, you win again. You win again! Ahh!
Roxie:	(screams)
Tracy:	(screams)
Clown:	(laughs)
Greg:	Billy, are you okay? Billy. Billy.
Tracy:	Billy.
Greg:	No, Billy.
Tracy:	Are you okay? [00:55:00] Oh, my God.
Clown:	(laughs)
Roxie:	If he can do it, so can I.
Greg:	Roxie, no! Roxie, wait, no! Roxie, stop! Roxie, stop moving. It's only making it worse. No, Roxie.
Roxie:	(screams)
Greg:	Stay still, stay still. Stay still. Stop. Shit. Roxie, stop. Stop.
Tracy:	Roxie, Roxie!
Greg:	You have to stop.
Roxie:	Ahh. I gotta get out of here.
Greg:	Please. Roxie slow down, please. Stop.
Roxie:	(screams)
Greg:	Roxie, no. Roxie, slow down.
Tracy:	Roxie, please stop! Come back here. You don't have to do this.
Greg:	Roxie, stop! Roxie, stop!
Roxie:	No, I have to get out of here!
Greg:	Roxie, no!
Tracy:	Roxie, Roxie!
Greg:	Roxie, stop. Roxie, slow down.
Tracy:	Roxie, come back!
Greg:	Roxie, stop. Come back here, please.
Tracy:	We have to save her! We have to save her, Roxie!
Greg:	No. No. Roxie, come back here.
Tracy:	You don't have to ... You don't have to do this. I gotta go help her. Roxie? Roxie? Roxie?
Greg:	Tracy, Tracy, Tracy.
Tracy:	Let me go! No.
Greg:	Come [00:55:30] on. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay, shh. Shh.
Valentine:	What gives you [00:57:30] the right, Kane?
Balthazar Kane:	Why, you do, Mr. Valentine. You give me the right. Now, please, go.
Valentine:	I'll leave, sure, after I get what's coming to me.
Balthazar Kane:	What's that, Mr. Valentine? Prison time? Now, I've asked you to leave, politely. Now, leave before [00:58:00] I lose my patience.
Valentine:	That property is mine, old man! And I'm leaving here with it.
Balthazar Kane:	You know, Mr. Valentine, for the strong man in my show, you really are rather quite weak, and quite pathetic. Now, you will leave my tent and you are fired.
Valentine:	No!
Travis:	No. No, Father!
Scott:	We've gotta do something. We gotta get out of here. We're [00:58:30] getting out of here. Hello?
Dispatcher:	911. What's [00:59:00] your emergency?
Scott:	We need an ambulance right away.
Dispatcher:	To what address?
Scott:	I, I, I don't know where I am.
Dispatcher:	We can triangulate where you are, please hold.
Scott:	Okay.
Carrie:	What's going on?
Scott:	They're trying to figure out where we are.
Dispatcher:	We found you. We will send over an ambulance right away.
Scott:	Okay.
Dispatcher:	It will be there in two hours.
Scott:	What? This is an emergency, somebody died! Are you kidding me, [00:59:30] t- two hours?
Dispatcher:	This is the soonest we can get to you. You are very far away from any emergency services.
Scott:	S- send, send somebody, send the police.
Dispatcher:	We will send a squad car as well.
Scott:	Fuck!
Carrie:	What?
Scott:	It's gonna be two hours before anyone can get here.
Carrie:	We find Kane, we find the others, tell them what happened.
Scott:	Kane doesn't give a fuck. Haven't you noticed?
Carrie:	Don't be ridiculous, a person died. That's taking the scare way too far. Let's go.
Scott:	[01:00:00] What are we gonna do with the body?
Carrie:	He's dead, Scott. We can't take him. We have to find Kane and find the others and tell them what happened. We can come back for him later.
Scott:	What about the money?
Carrie:	Fuck the money. We're going home.
Scott:	Come [01:00:30] on, let's go! Time it out. Go! Here, [01:01:00] give me your hand, let's go. We gotta go, come [01:01:30] on. Let's go! Give me your hand!
Carrie:	I can't!
Scott:	Come on.
Carrie:	I can't!
Scott:	You can. You can do it.
Carrie:	Give me your hand!
Scott:	[inaudible 01:01:38] Let's go! Next one, let's go, no breaks! (screams)
Carrie:	I'm sorry.
Scott:	Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on. Time it out. Let's go. Go! Jump again. I got you. Ed just got killed.
Greg:	Everyone else is dead.
Carrie:	Is this some kind of sick joke?
Greg:	A joke?
Tracy:	We're not kidding. They're all really dead.
Greg:	Roxie got ripped to shreds by barbed wire and Billy got a hatchet to the back.
Scott:	Well guess [01:02:00] what? I just called an ambulance. The closest one is two hours away.
Tracy:	Jesus Christ, what the fuck do we do now?
Carrie:	We're all gonna die.
Greg:	We're not gonna die.
Tracy:	No. No, it's okay. It's okay. We just gotta keep it together, okay? I sure as shit know I'm not gonna die at this house, so we just gotta get back to where we came from, start from the beginning and try to find a way out of this, okay? Fuck out.
Scott:	Let's get out of here.
Greg:	All right.
Scott:	Go.
Greg:	Come on.
Carrie:	Let us out!
Scott:	Hold [01:02:30] on, I can pick it.
Greg:	What the hell?
Tracy:	How are you gonna do that?
Scott:	With my pocket knife.
Greg:	You sure?
Scott:	Yeah.
Greg:	Oh, that's gnarly.
Carrie:	There's no use.
Greg:	Well, there's no use just standing around. Help us, come [01:03:00] on.
Tracy:	Hey, was that thing there before?
Carrie:	No. I'm not going in there.
Greg:	Uh, guys, guys.
Tracy:	Oh, yes you are.
Greg:	Go now, go. Go, go, go! (screaming)
Scott:	What [01:03:30] the fuck place is this?
Balthazar Kane:	In order to truly triumph, one must travel to the depths of hell and still come out on the other side.
Carrie:	Oh, fuck that.
Tracy:	[01:04:00] Oh, God.
Greg:	Go. God dammit, Kane.
Clown:	(laughs) (music)
Greg:	[01:04:30] This is not getting us anywhere, guys.
Tracy:	We have to keep pushing forward.
Carrie:	What's that sound?
Scott:	I don't know, but it can't be good.
Tracy:	I think he wants to help us see. Go grab those glow sticks.
Greg:	Oh. [01:05:00] Oh.
Tracy:	Oh, my God!
Greg:	(laughs)
Scott:	What?
Greg:	It's just water. I'm fine. Ahh! No. (screaming)
Tracy:	[01:06:30] Oh! No. No.
Carrie:	Ahh!
Tracy:	[01:07:00] Oh, my God. Oh. 
Clown:	(laughs)
Carrie:	(screaming) No.
Tracy:	(screams) Oh, my God. What the ... No. No.
Scott:	[inaudible 01:07:04] Hello, motherfucker! We gotta keep going. Who the hell is that?
Tracy:	[01:08:00] Kane.
Balthazar Kane:	Balthazar Kane, in the flesh. Or what remains.
Scott:	We're getting out of here, you psycho.
Balthazar Kane:	In due time, boy. In due time. [01:08:30] Such a pity, you two came so far, almost at the end.
Scott:	Why? Why would you do this?
Balthazar Kane:	This magnificent theater of pain [01:09:00] and blood? (laughs)
Tracy:	Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!
Balthazar Kane:	My boy, I am the hunter who eats the flesh of his prey. Calling the herd of mankind. One, two, three. (laughs) [01:09:30] With my teeth and claws.
Scott:	You're insane.
Balthazar Kane:	Insane in the membrane. (laughs) Careful, that's very sharp. (laughs) Now, am I insane or are you just [01:10:00] too weak and pathetic and scared to look into the abyss? To stare into the faces of all of God's monsters on Heaven and Earth that await you in the black hole of eternity? I don't expect you lemmings to understand a lion, [01:10:30] or an ant to comprehend a giant's view of the world.
Scott:	You have no right, those people died.
Balthazar Kane:	(laughs) Yes. They died, horrible, painful, beautiful, sublime deaths. [01:11:00] Baptism of blood for the great horror show that waits for all of us. You see boy, death is the one true God. And I am death's tattered angel. Spreading her cold harsh words, one [01:11:30] soul at a time.
Scott:	What?
Balthazar Kane:	Fear not. Your death, your death will have a place in history, yes. Your pain and suffering, and sacrifice will grant you immortality at my side as a small part of my [01:12:00] horror legacy. My legacy. Balthazar Kane's legacy of horror. (laughs)
Scott:	No, I'm not gonna be a part of your legacy. And if you don't let me out right now, I'm gonna gut you like a fucking fish.
Balthazar Kane:	That's it, boy! Gut me like a fish! ( [01:12:30] laughs) Gotta keep the show and the people entertained till the very fucking end now, don't we? Wouldn't wanna disappoint your fucking horror fans, would we? (laughs) Gut me like a fucking fish. "And at its heels, leashed in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire. Crouch for employment. [01:13:00] But pardon, gentles all." (laughs) "Cry havoc, let slip the dogs of war."
Tracy:	What is that? What is that?
Scott:	[01:13:30] Run, Tracy. Run Tracy, run!
Balthazar Kane:	All right, play time is over. And then there were two. (music) [01:14:00] Where are you, my little piggies? Where could you be?
Scott:	Those crazy fucks are still in here. Tracy, wait!
Balthazar Kane:	(laughs) Fe, [01:14:30] fi, [01:15:00] fo, fum, I smell the blood of my piggies as they run. (laughs)
Scott:	Shh, it's me, it's me, it's me. We need to split up.
Tracy:	Are you insane?
Scott:	It's the only way.
Balthazar Kane:	So very nice of you to [01:15:30] invite me to play hide and seek.
Tracy:	No, Scott, we can't.
Scott:	There's two of us. There's one of him. There's other crazies but we can sneak up on him and then take care of them later. Trust me.
Tracy:	Oh, my God!
Balthazar Kane:	And then, [01:16:00] there were one. (laughing) Tracy my dear, did you know that the human head weighs eight pounds? (laughing) Chop away, boys! ( [01:16:30] laughs)
Tracy:	(screams) No.
Balthazar Kane:	Tracy my dear, where are you going? You're my last little piggy.
Clowns:	(laughing)
Tracy:	Open the door. Open the god damn door, dammit!
Balthazar Kane:	[01:17:00] There she is, my final girl. Such a perfect tableau for a finale. You, my sweetness, you must be so, so very honored.
Tracy:	[01:17:30] What the hell do you want from me?
Balthazar Kane:	What the hell do you want from me? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We already played that part of the show, darling. Th- this is the fourth act, that was the second act. Okay? Le- le- let me refresh your memory. See, I've been playing the monologuing monster, who loves the macabre, all right? Being very politely, very politely answering all of your questions and giving you hints, and allowing you to run all over my house playing [01:18:00] hide and seek, which I do rather enjoy. But now, there is only one little piggy and that's you. And this is where we get down to the, well, my favorite part of the show. The bone, the blood, the gristle and meat.  All right, [01:18:30] let's make this interesting, shall we? Let's add some stakes to our final death match!
Tracy:	Open the door!
Balthazar Kane:	You've heard of the saying, life is pain, haven't you? Well, this is a little game I like to call, pain for life. How do you play that game, Johnny? Let me tell ya right now how you play the game. All right, final girl, come on down, you're our next contestant on pain for your life! In this [01:19:00] chest, what do we have? We have here on the side a little magic button. And what does that magic button do? Well, let me tell you, folks, what the magic button does. It holds the key to all of final girl's dreams, desires, and hopes. And what would they be? Well let me tell you folks what those things are. Those are freedom, the front door, security, and a boring fucking life. (laughs) 
	Isn't it amazing, final girl, how [01:19:30] one's life can come down to one thing? And that one thing is surviving the pain. (screaming) Naughty little piggy. That's it, final girl, I knew you wouldn't disappoint.
Tracy:	No, no, no.
Balthazar Kane:	That was not very nice! Ah! Ah! Piggy, piggy, piggy! (laughs) (screams) Tracy, my final girl. Where are you going?! We're not done yet. This is our denouement. Every show must have a [01:21:00] proper ending.
Policeman:	Are you okay?
Tracy:	What?
Policeman:	Are you okay, Miss? What's your name?
Tracy:	Tracy. We have to get out of here.
Policeman:	Call it in. We have a possible 187 and 245 A.
Tracy:	No, no, no, you don't understand. He's still in there, he's coming.
Policeman:	Please come with me.
Tracy:	No, no. You have to end this. Please, you have to end this.
Balthazar Kane:	Tracy, my love, this has to end.
Policeman:	[01:21:30] Freeze. Get your hands up and get on the ground!
Balthazar Kane:	Freeze. Get your hands behind your head and get on the ground. Do it now! (laughs)
Policeman:	I said freeze!
Balthazar Kane:	Sorry gentlemen, that's not how this fairy tale plays.
Policeman:	Stop!
Balthazar Kane:	No, not at all.
Policeman:	I'm not gonna warn you again. Get your hands up, drop the weapon, get down on the ground or we will fire.
Balthazar Kane:	"Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus-
Policeman:	Stop! Get down now!
Balthazar Kane:	... and we petty men. Walk under his [01:22:00] huge leg and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves."
Policeman:	Drop the weapon now!
Balthazar Kane:	[inaudible 01:22:06]. (laughs)
Policeman:	Don't take another step.
Balthazar Kane:	Magic is sacrifice.
Policeman:	Freeze!
Tracy:	[01:22:30] That man tried to murder me.
Det. Lemar:	Look, I've got a house full of booby traps and dead bodies. And we have no clue how any of this happened.
Tracy:	Fine.
Det. Lemar:	Wait here. That girl's been through hell.
Det. Sanders:	Yes, [01:23:00] she has. Yup. Check this out.
Det. Lemar:	Well, your story checks out. The footage from the house backs up [01:23:30] everything you said so you're free to go.
Tracy:	Thanks.
Det. Lemar:	Hey, I'm sorry.
Tracy:	It's okay. You were just doing your job.
Det. Lemar:	Well, it must at least give you some comfort knowing that monster Kane who tried to kill you and burn your father, Robbie Valentine, all those [01:24:00] years ago. Well, he finally got what he deserved.
Tracy:	That monster.
Det. Lemar:	Good night, Miss Valentine.
Tracy:	Goodnight, officer.
Balthazar Kane:	Endure the pain. To learn true magic, you must endure the pain. Magic, sacrifice. It's [01:24:30] almost done for us, darling. Valhalla waits for the boast of warriors.
Tracy:	Don't worry, Father, you'll be out soon enough.
Balthazar Kane:	[01:25:00] The art of misdirection is the power, to direct the audiences' attention in one direction, while making them distracted from the other. Must go out with a bang.
Tracy:	What if I can't do it? What if I'm not good enough?
Balthazar Kane:	And our reward shall be immortality. You ready? It's [01:25:30] showtime.
Tracy:	Okay. (music)
Balthazar Kane:	Welcome my future corpses, to Circus Kane where you'll see the most amazing freak show ever known to man. The two-headed woman, the dog-faced boy. [01:26:00] Where women are sawed in half, where limbs are ripped and lions will tear the entrails from the infidel. Here at Circus Kane, pain is pleasure and pleasure is pain. And we provide it all, for your entertainment. So come on down and see what it's all about at Circus Kane. (music)
Tracy:	[01:26:30] This Halloween feed your fear. Fear, the hunger of your soul begging to be tested. Be reborn with the new hippodrome of horror, the new Circus Kane. The only experience from the true [01:27:00] undead legend of the macabre. Balthazar Kane went insane and murdered them all for world acclaim. Now, his soul haunts the house of death. Do you dare to go to his valley of the shadow of death? Listen closely, and you'll feel his breath. See you soon. (music)
