JAMIE	I truly believe that there is only One person, only One in this World that is meant to be your Soulmate, your Lifelong Companion. The Joke is rarely do these Two People Hook Up. You just wander about aimlessly, Lost in The Sauce. But y’know God is a Trickster. In Life, God doesn’t give you the People you want, instead he gives you the  People you need.
JAMIE	Nola Darling is that need.

MARS	YO!!! What ‘bout Nola Darlin’? What do you wanna know?
MARS	Dag, it took you long enough to invite me in. 
NOLA	Dag, I don’t just let anybody inhere. Is MARS a nickname?
MARS	Nah, it’s my Gov’ment. My Moms named me MARS cuz’ she said “I’m outta dis Universe.” Dope.
MARS	Bet.
NOLA	It’s not finished.
MARS	Still Dope.
NOLA	My Born Day is May 19th.
MARS	Happy Early Born Day. You got plans yet?
NOLA	Not yet.
MARS	Let me know if you wanna do a Lil’ Sumthin’, Sumthin’.
NOLA 	I will.
MARS	Bet
MARS	Mars, Malcolm X was born on May 19th, too.
MARS	Denzel did Da Damn Thing.
NOLA	And got robbed of that Academy Award.
MARS	Sounds like some Shenanigans, some Subterfuge, some straight up Skullduggery.
 NOLA	Skullduggery? Where you get that word from?
MARS	Mike Tyson.
NOLA	Bless Iron Mike.
NOLA	Back on Track. “D” wuz Too Black.  Too Strong. Al Pacino? C’mon now.
MARS	Don’t Hate on Pacino. Scarface,dat’s my Joint.
NOLA	You know what a Make Up Call is in Basketball?
MARS	Does MARS Blackmon know what a Make Up Call is in Basketball? Is Barry White? Is Al Green? Is James Brown? Is Prince Purple? I know, I know. Do you know? Do you know? Do you know MARS knows BALL.
NOLA	It’s when a Referee blows an obvious call, so the next one is a Make Up Call for the other Team that got Screwed, to even it up, make it seem to be fair.
MARS	Nola, what’s da point?
NOLA	The point is, Denzel’s “Malcolm” lost to Pacino’s “Blind Man” in Scent of a Woman for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role. It was a Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Make Up Call. Pacino got Fucked 4 times. Fucked over for Godfather and Godfather II, Serpico and Fucked Big Time again for Dog Day Afternoon. 
MARS	Damn, Sam.
NOLA	So they give Pacino his long overdue Oscar and then Denzel gets his Make Up Call Oscar for Training Day, which he shoulda Won anyway. So Da Academy still owes D another one.
MARS	Word to Da Mother. You know lot ‘bout Movies, huh?
NOLA	I’m a Cinephile.
