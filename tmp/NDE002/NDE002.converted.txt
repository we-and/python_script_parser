ROGNEDA: 		Where's Vladimir? 

BLUD: 			Vladimir? Vladimir is the grand prince!

VARYAZHKO: 	He's just a halfbreed. The son of a  slavewoman! 

VARYAZHKO: 	People like him shouldn't live!

VARYAZHKO: 	Wait! 

VARYAZHKO: 	Fyodor!

VARYAZHKO: 	Promise you'll protect Irina!

CROWD: 		She's gone!

VARYAZHKO: 	If she's still alive...

FYODOR: 		Look after yourself.

CROWD: 		The prince is generous...

SAMOKHA:		everyone... gone to Kiev. Vladimir promised it will be  like under his father. 

PUTYATA: 		Not everyone can be traitors.. 

SAMOKHA: 		So is it us against them all?

SAMOKHA: 		He's right, they are many.

VARYAZHKO:		If they are many, does it mean they're not traitors?

VARYAZHKO: 	Let's vow with our blood that we'll take revenge on Vladimir.

VARYAZHKO: 	I am dying for the previous life... and only the halfbreed's blood will bring me back. 

FYODOR: 		Lord have mercy on us... 

VARYAZHKO'S CIRCLE: 	I am dying for the previous life... and only the halfbreed's blood  will bring me back. 

CROWD: 		Go on!

SVENELD Voiceover:	Vladimir ended the war. And the people accepted... But they didn't accept Vladimir. To all.  He remained a halfbreed, a stranger to all. To prevail, Vladimi had to become greater than his brother was  for everyone. To prevail, Vladimi had to become greater than his brother was for everyone. And only his father had been greater. This night in the city they were expecting the dead prince to come to him to get revenge.

SVENELD: 		Say who. The dead man is taking revenge On you.

VLADIMIR: 		Hands off!

VLADIMIR: 		You were trying to raise him? With this?

IRINA: 		He is dead.

VLADIMIR: 		You’re lying. You were reading over him?

IRINA: 		Yes. I was reading. And soon he will rise. Don’t you know? All the dead will be resurrected! 

IRINA: 		They will rise and walk.

VLADIMIR: 		Will he rise? Later, yes?

VLADIMIR: 		That means it's not him.

VLADIMIR: 		You needn't fear. I'll raise his son like my own.

VLADIMIR: 		Believe me: 

VLADIMIR: 		I'll be strong like my father.

SVENELD Voiceover:	The old gods couldn't defend Yaropolk.  And  Vladimir threw them  down the hill. He dug up his father's god  to gain his strength. So that everyone saw he was as great a prince  as his father.  But the god of Svyatoslav loved human blood  and that's why it was buried when  the old prince was killed. 

VLADIMIR: 		I'm alive!





MAGIAN'S 		He is hungry. He wants to eat!  

Vladimir: 		I give God the father's brother

MAGIAN'S 		He needs living blood. Living flesh. Answer, are you worthy of him?  Your father's god?

VLADIMIR: 		We'll make this sacrifice!

VLADIMIR: 		Be with me!

FYODOR: 		Let's get out of here.

VLADIMIR: 		My father’s God is the God of fortune and glory. 

VLADIMIR: 		He will protect us all!

VLADIMIR: 		Be with me!

VARYAZHKO: 	We’ll kill the halfbreed. Put Irina on the throne. And we’ll be near.

VARYAZHKO: 	And here are the nomads.

SAMOKHA:		Ah yes

VARYAZHKO: 	I need your Kagan!

VARYAZHKO: 	Kagan!

VARYAZHKO: 	Yaropolk is killed. I have his coffers. 

VARYAZHKO: 	You'll be rich, but in return you'll help me kill the Russian prince!

VARYAZHKO: 	Remember the rotten wall in the Lower City? 

SAMOKHA: 		I remember.

VARYAZHKO: 	Wait there! 

SAMOKHA: 		Uh-huh

CROWD:		Come on, lift it up! I'm tired out...

CROWD: 		Pechenegs!

CROWD: 		Pechenegs!

CROWD: 		Pechenegs!

CROWD: 		What are you waiting for? Hurry!

CROWD:		Faster!  Hurry! the gates are closing!

IRINA: 		No! Don't do it!  

SVENELD: 		Get the people away! You think, you half-wit, there’s another prince  in Kiev?

VARYAZHKO: 	Stop!

SVENELD: 		Want me to give him to you?  Throw him down right now?  He'll ripen in the sun!

VARYAZHKO: 	Get back,

VARYAZHKO: 	get back!

VARYAZHKO: 	Kagan! order them back!

IRINA: 		I beg you, help!

VARYAZHKO: 	I'll tear your arms off!

VLADIMIR: 		Go away!

VARYAZHKO: 	Give me Irina!

VLADIMIR: 		That's enough, stop it. 

VARYAZHKO: 	Let her go and I'll go straight away!

VARYAZHKO: 	And you will save the city! 

VARYAZHKO: 	If you don’t believe me, believe dead Yaropolk!

VARYAZHKO: 	I have his coffers! 

VARYAZHKO: 	I’ll pay them and they’ll go right away into the steppe! 

VARYAZHKO: 	No one else will die.

VARYAZHKO: 	Give me Irina! Vladimir!

VLADIMIR: 		I gave you life! What did you do with it?

VARYAZHKO: 	If you change your mind, you know where to find me!

VARYAZHKO: 	The new prince chose war!

IRINA: 		Let me go, 

IRINA: 		I beg you, let me go! 

IRINA: 		Save me and the city!

ROGNEDA: 		Let her go. 

ROGNEDA: 		Give us hope!

VLADIMIR: 		I’ll protect you, believe me!

ROGNEDA: 		I thought you were warriors,  but you’re traders!

HOVDING: 		You owe us much more!

HOVDING: 		Give them the Berserker!

EINAR:		For your gold, we’ll give you just one warrior! But he’s the best!

SVENELD Voiceover: 	Pechenegs... were raring to go out on raids and Varyazhko gathered the entire steppe population under Kiev's walls. Then Vladimir decided to send

FYODOR: 		God, save and preserve us. 

VLADIMIR: 		Come back alive.

FYODOR: 		You’ll give this to  Ioann, my son.

CROWD: 		Quick, lift it up! Put it out!

CROWD: 		We'll all burn to death. IRINA: -God have mercy!

CROWD: 		Quick, water! Hurry! Pour it on! 

CROWD: 		Quick, we'll burn up. Pour it over!

VLADIMIR: 		My father's god helped us! Thank him you're alive! 

VLADIMIR: 		The Pechenegs haven't left! The warriors stay with me on the wall

THE MAGIAN'S HELPER:	Do you know how to start a fire?

IOANN: 		Of course.. 

THE MAGIAN'S HELPER:	Come and help us?

IOANN: 		My father told me to wait at home. 

THE MAGIAN'S HELPER:	Did you know that gods sent rain?  Now you can save us. I see my father! I see my mother! CROWD: -I see my mother! I see my master! CROWD: -I see my master! He sits  in a garden,  it's fair and green! And he waits for me!

CROWD: 		 I see my father!

CROWD: 		He sits in a garden,   it's fair and green!

IOANN: 		And he waits for me! 

CROWD: 		And he waits for me! And he waits for me!

IOANN: 		Father, I'll save them all!

FYODOR: 		Let's go home.

IOANN: 		Dad, they said  I'd save them all! 

FYODOR: 		You'll save them. Let's go home and come back.

FYODOR:		So?

ROGNEDA: -		The boy's chosen, he'll save us! 

FYODOR: 		Where's your husband Vladimir?

FYODOR: 		Make way!

IOANN: 		Father! Father!

IOANN: 		Father! Father!

FYODOR:		Come here!

FYODOR: 		Make way I said!

IRINA: 		Take care! 

CROWD: 		Bring the swords here and pile them up!

IRINA: 		They're celebrating, you hear? 

IRINA: 		Shouldn't you be with them?

CROWD: 		Hear, they're celebrating already.

VLADIMIR: 		Don't be afraid! They believe my father's strength has returned!

FYODOR: 		Vladimir!

FYODOR: 		Vladimir!

EINAR: 		They'll kill him.

HOVDING: 		No.

HOVDING: 		He's a real fighter. Shall we bet on your knife? EINAR: - I'll give you my knife if he survives.

EINAR: 		Hey!

FYODOR:		Who do you bow to?

FYODOR: 		Those aren’t gods.

FYODOR: 		They will rot tomorrow!

EINAR: 		Cut the pillars! 

ROGNEDA: 		Cut the pillars!

ROGNEDA: 		Cut the pillars! 

EINAR: 		Cut the pillars!

CROWD: 		Fair and green...

FYODOR: 		Vladimir!

LOBAN: 		Prince! 

LOBAN: 		Over there...

 IRINA: 		Go!

CROWD: 		The garden's fair and green!

FYODOR: 		Lord have mercy...

IOANN: 		Father!

FYODOR: 		What?

IOANN: 		Will we die?

FYODOR: 		No.

FYODOR: 		I said,  There's no death! 

FYODOR: 		He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty...I will say of the Lord! He is my refuge and my fortress: my God. In him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler..



ROGNEDA: 		All this is only for your sake! 

VLADIMIR: 		What? Stop! Stop!

FYODOR:		under his wings shalt thou trust:  his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

VLADIMIR: 		Stop!

ROGNEDA:		Back! 

VLADIMIR: 		Fyodor!

FYODOR: 		Come here son! 

VLADIMIR: 		Fyodor!

VLADIMIR: 		Fyodor!

EINAR:		I won!

VLADIMIR: 		What?

VLADIMIR: 		What?

THE MAGIAN'S HELPER:	Unless we give our gods what we love most, how can they know we love them? The sacrifice is made. The gods will save us! He warned you. You don't belong here, like a Viking! You brought woe!

IRINA:			You will meet him for sure! You hear me? You'll meet him! There's no death!

ROGNEDA: 		There is!

ROGNEDA: 		They mustn't see you this way!

IRINA: 		Please let me go!

SVENELD Voiceover: 	The god of our forefathers did not accept our sacrifice. The Pechenegs didn't leave. Everyone saw we couldn't save the city. So Vladimir took the risk  and grabbed Fortune by the throat.   He agreed to meet Varyazhko.

LOBAN: 		Helmets !

IRINA: 		What is that?

IRINA: 		Anna

VLADIMIR: 		What?

IRINA: 		Anna.

IRINA: 		Anna. A Greek name. Not one of yours.

VLADIMIR: 		How did you know it’s Anna?

IRINA: 		Here are the Greek letters. Look: A-

IRINA: 		"N" N", "A"

IRINA: 		What does that mean? 

VLADIMIR: 		A...Anna.

IRINA: 		It means God’s grace! 

IRINA: 		They gave me this name in the convent. 

VLADIMIR: 		What’s God’s grace?

IRINA: 		There’s a woman’s love and there’s love from God. God's grace is a gift of love from God.

VLADIMIR: 		A gift from God!  From which god, you didn’t say?

IRINA: 		There’s only one God! 

IRINA: 		And he loves you! 

IRINA: 		And he can save you. Remember that.

VLADIMIR: 		Take it with you!

VLADIMIR: 		As a keepsake.

VARYAZHKO: 	Lead her away!

VARYAZHKO: 	Vladimir!

VARYAZHKO: 	Don’t let them go.

SVENELD: 		Let's run!

SVENELD: 		Don't stand there!

VLADIMIR: 		This way!

SVENELD: 		Let's jump!

VARYAZHKO: 	Halfbreed!

VARYAZHKO: 	I know you’re here!

VARYAZHKO: 	Did you get scared? 

VARYAZHKO: 	Answer me!

VARYAZHKO: 	The Romans...

VARYAZHKO: 	Stop! 

VARYAZHKO: 	Where you are off to?

KAGAN: 		We don't fight the Romans. 

KAGAN: 		We have an agreement with them.

VARYAZHKO: 	Stop!

VARYAZHKO: 	Where you are off to? You promised. 

VLADIMIR: 		Where's Rogneda? 

LOBAN: 		She's at the sacred ground.

SVENELD: 		What are you thinking of? While the Roman envoys are here the Pechenegs won't stick their heads in, do you hear? The Roman emperor is the strongest.  Take whatever they give but don't trust them. You're always be strange to them, like a  bunch of rabble. 

VLADIMIR: 	My brother came to an agreement with the Romans and the Pechenegs didn't touch him for many years

SVENELD:		 Came to an agreement? They hired your father. And when he disobeyed  they killled him  at the hands of the Pechenegs. 

VLADIMIR: 	We need to stop being afraid. Being afraid of Pecheneg attack. Night will come, day will follow. I need the strength of the Romans.

ANASTASIUS:		These trunks with gifts and the leopard are from the emperor to the Archon. It's Emperor Basil the Porphyrogenitus and his sister Anna with his co-ruler Constantine. 

VLADIMIR: 		Anna - a gift from God.

ANASTASIUS: 	Yes?

VLADIMIR: 		a gift from God!

ANASTASIUS:		The emperor offers you and your warriors glory if you can besiege Korsun. There is rebellion in the empire, the city of Korsun is on the side of the rebels.

VLADIMIR: 		I'll help you but not for gold.

ANASTASIUS:		What does the Archon mean? What does he want?

VLADIMIR: 		God's gift!

ANASTASIUS: 	You said God's gift?

VLADIMIR: 		Anna.

ANASTASIUS:		It's impossible. The Archon cannot receive the noble Anna as a wife. They even refused the German emperor. You must forget about her. The Archon can ask the emperor for anything except Anna. Say, what do you want?






VLADIMIR: 		I want her as my wife.

HOVDING:		You kept your word.  The gold of the Romans is good for fighting morale.  The Vikings are with you. We are going to the wall!

ROGNEDA: 		Will you go with everyone?

VLADIMIR: 		Where to?

ROGNEDA: 		To the sacred ground.  We need to ask the gods for protection from the Pechenegs. The Romans are leaving.

VLADIMIR: 		I've made all my sacrifices.

ROGNEDA:		All of them?

VLADIMIR: 		Get dressed.

ROGNEDA: 	 I would have taken my life too and stayed with you to the end, you know! You’ll have a son.

VLADIMIR: 		What?

ROGNEDA: 		Yes.

VLADIMIR: 		So you wanted to kill us all?

VLADIMIR: 		You’re going back to Polotsk!

ROGNEDA: 		What gift do you need? From which god?

SVENELD Voiceover: 	All night the Pecheneg camp was noisy And someone screamed horribly beyond the wall. Everyone Was preparing for the worst. Yes, the Romans agreed to give Vladimir the emperor’s sister Anna,  Since they knew we couldn’t take the stone city. And trying to take Korsun was madness. But this morning this didn’t matter  And everyone thought only of death, hidden in the fog. Hidden in the fog.

LOBAN: 		Halt! Hey!

SVENELD: 		So how is it going Putyata? 

SVENELD: 		Where are the Pechenegs?

PUTYATA:		The Romans said they formed a union with Vladimir now. And Pechenegs don’t fight Romans.They’re holding Kogan’s son hostage so the Pechenegs keep to the deal.

VLADIMIR: 		Is Irina alive?

PUTYATA:		She’s alive!

PUTYATA:		Varyazhko took her away to Korsun,

VLADIMIR: 		Gather our men. 

LOBAN: 		Get up!

VLADIMIR: 		Send messengers to all the cities, I need God’s Gift!

CROWD: 		What will happen to us now?

VLADIMIR: 		We’re going to take Korsun!

LOBAN:		Make way, make way!

GREEK:		Irina!

GREEK: 		Come here!

GREEK: 		You'll translate.

VLADIMIR: 		I’m Vladimir! 

VLADIMIR: 		I’m a friend of your Emperor!

IRINA: 		I’m Vladimir!  I’m a friend of your Emperor

VLADIMIR: 		I swear by the memory of my father 

VLADIMIR: 		Svyatoslav.

VLADIMIR: 		 I won’t leave here until 

VLADIMIR: 		I take your city!

IRINA: 		I swear I'll take your city!

VLADIMIR: 		But if any one of you will open the gates for me  you or you  or  you! I swear by the memory of my forefathers, I won’t kill anyone!  I won't touch anyone!  Save yourself  and the city!

IRINA: 		Tie the bracelet onto the map so he knows who it's from.

IRINA: 		Hush now, hush, hush

CROWD: 		What's that? 

CROWD: 		Look!

VARYAZHKO: 	Wait,  did you believe him?

VARYAZHKO: 	She told me it all. Well about the hill and about the water pipe to the city.

VARYAZHKO: 	Tell me, does everyone know about it or just you?

ANASTASIUS: 	I myself blessed it.

VARYAZHKO: 	And where is it?

ANASTASIUS: 	On the Soapy Hill.

VARYAZHKO: 	So you drew him the map and sent it? 

IRINA: 		Pateras!

IRINA: 		Come to me.

VARYAZHKO: 	Irina.

VARYAZHKO: 	Everywhere... the same thing happens.

VARYAZHKO: 	Why?! 

VARYAZHKO: 	Why?! 

VARYAZHKO: 	Irina, why?

VARYAZHKO: 	He is a slave! A halfbreed! 

VARYAZHKO: 	He's not a prince! 

ANASTASIUS: 	Why did you tell him?  

IRINA: 		Vladimir will have no mercy on him. 

VARYAZHKO: 	He’ll cut off the pipe and leave the city without water.

VARYAZHKO: 	Have  you been with him? 

VARYAZHKO: 	Answer!

VARYAZHKO: 	Why are you silent? 

IRINA: 		Father, He'll get in. Take my confession. 

IRINA: 		I sinned. You sheltered us and I asked you  to send the arrow, but not for the sake of the city, for him.

VARYAZHKO:		Look at me.  Swear!  When the killer comes here - you will do everything to stop him finding you!  Swear! Swear it, I’ll kill the child.  you will leave the city and won't search for him.Swear it, or I'll kill the child!  Swear it!. 

IRINA: 		No.

VARYAZHKO: 	You have put out the light in my heart.

VLADIMIR:		See, two trees. Where is this pipe? 

LOBAN: 		Well yes, the city is that way. 

SVENELD Voiceover:  	Everyone understood that a long siege would not capture the city.  The warriors started heading home. To stop them, Vladimir ordered their ships to be dragged up the hill. Those who fled by steppe met the Pechenegs.  They stood at our backs.  The water pipe was Vladimir's only hope.

EINAR: 		Be glad, Konung. I came to help you, first of the Vikings. 

VLADIMIR: 		Where are the rest? 

EINAR: 		Asleep! They mixed wine and beer...

EINAR: 		Have you been to Roman cities?

EINAR: 		They say they know how to dig the pipe for water into the ground. Have you heard of this? There are places where the water pipe starts even further from the city than here.

VARYAZHKO: 	Sveneld! is that you?  Whenever I meet you,  you are digging holes.

SVENELD: 		It’s not for myself. I’ll throw your bones in there!

VARYAZHKO: 	Halfbreed! 

VARYAZHKO: 	Look! 

VARYAZHKO: 	This is for you! I barely persuaded the Pechenegs. 

VARYAZHKO: 	They wanted just to slaughter you! 

VARYAZHKO: 	They say you are a fool: a woman told him, and he believed it!

CROWD: 		Have they lured us into an ambush? Looks like it...

VLADIMIR:		What are you standing around for? Drag  over the shields and spears, quickly!

LOBAN: 		Quickly, he said!

SVENELD: 		Your luck is back! 

VLADIMIR: 		The ships!! We'll push down the ships!

SVENELD: 		Let's do it.

VLADIMIR: 		Follow me.

VARYAZHKO: 	Hey, halfbreed! 

VARYAZHKO: 	Where are you rushing off to? 

VARYAZHKO: 	We'll tell the Romans our people put you on the stake!

VLADIMIR: 		Knock away the supports!

VLADIMIR: 		Go that way!

SVENELD: 		We're stuck!

VLADIMIR: 		Push! 

VLADIMIR: 		Push!





SVENELD: 		Where are these ships?

VLADIMIR: 		This way!

VLADIMIR: 		Quick!

HOVDING:		The Vikings always come in time!

HOVDING: 		Einar!

VLADIMIR: 		Come on!

VLADIMIR: 		Come on!

CROWD: 		Come on!

ВЛАДИМИР: 		Давай!

VLADIMIR: 		Come on!

VLADIMIR: 		Stop!

VARYAZHKO: 	Vladimir!

PUTYATA: 		That's enough, brother! Let's go home!

VARYAZHKO: 	Where is my home now?

VARYAZHKO: 	Look, old man! 

VARYAZHKO: 	He was born a slave - and thinks  he’ll save himself like one!

SVENELD: 		So what do you say? Here? If you tell us,  you'll die easily without torment.

VARYAZHKO: 	You ask Anastasius.  

SVENELD: 		Uh-huh

VARYAZHKO: 	He's local. 

SVENELD: 		I will ask.

VARYAZHKO:		And the halfbreed thought Irina told him  the truth.. 

SVENELD: 		She won't tell..

VARYAZHKO: 	You betrayed her!  You gave her to me! You brought her yourself!

VLADIMIR: 		Where is she?

VARYAZHKO: 	She swore by her god that she would never see you again!

VLADIMIR: 		Where is she?

VARYAZHKO: 	And where is your wife? Did you strangle her or throw her out? You came here for a new woman after all! Your brother Yaropolk loved you! And you slaughtered him! They didn’t do it - you did!  Who will avenge it?   Only you are left! They are all dead!  Run after yourself! Take revenge on.. yourself!

VARYAZHKO: 	I see my Master! I see  my Master!

CROWD: 		Prince, I found it! The pipe's here!

VARYAZHKO: 	Go on!

VARYAZHKO: 	Go on! 

VLADIMIR:		You're lying! You don’t see anything. You don’t see anything. 

CROWD: 		What are you waiting for? Break it!

VARYAZHKO: 	Go on!

VLADIMIR: 		It wasn’t me who killed  And I won't kill you! 

CROWD: 		We found it!

CROWD: 		So have you ever seen such a city? Look what a city it is!

VLADIMIR: 		Where is Anastasius?

ANASTASIUS: 	You mustn't come here with weapons.

VLADIMIR: 		Is it yours?

VLADIMIR: 		Where is Irina? 

ANASTASIUS: 	She left.

ANASTASIUS: 	Two days ago.

ANASTASIUS: 	I don't know. 

VLADIMIR: 		You’re lying.

ANASTASIUS: 	You mustn't lie in here.

ANASTASIUS: 	Why do you need her? You're a friend of the Emperor.

ANASTASIUS: 	They'll give you his sister Anna.

VLADIMIR: 		Yes they will.

VLADIMIR: 		Do they go in the water here? 

ANASTASIUS: 	Yes. Here. But first you need to talk. With me. 

VLADIMIR: 		Talk?

ANASTASIUS: 	Tell me everything bad that you can remember.

ANASTASIUS: 	Those are the rules here. If you don’t want to do it now come later. When you’re ready.

VLADIMIR: 		Why later? Let’s do it now. What do I have to say?

ANASTASIUS: 	Whatever you want.

VLADIMIR: 		Bad things?

VLADIMIR:		In my childhood I stole a toy ship from my brother.

ANASTASIUS:		And then?

VLADIMIR: 		Then I killed him.

ANASTASIUS: 	Because of the toy?  Did you kill him yourself?

VLADIMIR: 		Myself.

ANASTASIUS: 	Is that all?

VLADIMIR: 		No. I also took my wife by force.  And her mother watched. And her father watched. Then I killed my wife’s mother. Then I killed her father. 

ANASTASIUS: 	You killed them yourself? 

VLADIMIR: 		Yes myself. I killed many people, one of the best men.. his son, who was this high, died.

ANASTASIUS: 	Wait, do you have any water?


ANASTASIUS: 	Wait! Wait! Is it clean? This is you. At the start of life. This is... you stealing the toy from your brother This... is you killing your brother -This is you killing your wife’s father. Then you killed your wife’s mother. Then that warrior died. Then his son. Now this is you. Know, God loves you. And he can purify you with his fire.

ANASTASIUS: 	Now can you drink it?

VLADIMIR: 		Yes you can. Only it stinks...

SVENELD: 		The emperor - When you’re going into the church - tell me. I’ll be near. All our men will go too.

VLADIMIR: 		Go where? 

SVENELD: 		To the church!

SVENELD: 		We’ll go in, say we want to convert to the new faith after our prince...

SVENELD: 		What?

VLADIMIR: 		I thought I'd be without you.... 

SVENELD: 		How could it be without me?

SVENELD: 		What would I do without you?

SVENELD: 		I would have gone myself. But they won’t let me through. They won't let me up

SVENELD: 		close! 

VLADIMIR: 		Won’t let you through where?

SVENELD: 		To the Emperor. Only you can talk to him.

SVENELD: 		People say he is very nimble.

SVENELD:		If you strike like this, you see, you deflected it, and he'll deflect it! You need to strike like this! The main thing is don't worry! You'll go up to him and smile and say: I love you, -brother, and your God, too'. You just need to strike precisely and that's it, no more Basileus! Got it You'll avenge your father. 

VLADIMIR: 		No.

SVENELD: 		No what?

VLADIMIR: 		I won’t kill any more.

SVENELD: 		You're your father's son.

VLADIMIR: 		There's no death.

VLADIMIR: 		You will rise again!

SVENELD: 		And you believe that?

SVENELD: 		Very well.

SVENELD: 		For me to believe it, I have to see it.

VLADIMIR: 		See what?

SVENELD: 		Let me kill you and you’ll get resurrected and come to see me, then I’ll believe it. Well you say there’s no death and you’ll rise again! 

VLADIMIR: 		Wait!

SVENELD: 		Go on, go on! There’s no death, you say! 

VLADIMIR: 		Stop!

SVENELD:		No death!

SVENELD: 		I believed in you and you betrayed me! You’re a slave, you’ll snuff it like a slave and traitor, you betrayed everyone who followed you. There is death and you know it!

SVENELD: 		I won’t die lying in my bed.

SVENELD: 		You’re right!

SVENELD: 		Die like a warrior!
VLADIMIR: 		No.

VLADIMIR: 		No I won’t take revenge on you! I’ll forget it, trust me. 

SVENELD: 		Who are you trying to fool? people don’t change!

SVENELD: 		Why would they?

SVENELD: 		Come on!

SVENELD: 		Come on then! 

VLADIMIR: 		You need to see it to believe?

SVENELD: 		See what?

VLADIMIR:		I’m ready, go on!

SVENELD: 		Take your sword!

SVENELD: 		Die like a warrior, don’t be a slave!

VLADIMIR: 		I’m a slave of God and no one else.

SVENELD: 		The sound of the sea makes me think of eternity but when I close my eyes I see the forest in winter and the cold and white snow tell me about death. Why didn’t I kill him? He’s become part of me in this life! And I won’t have another one now.

ANASTASIUS: 	Come in!

ANASTASIUS: 	Come in!

ANASTASIUS: 	Don't be shy!

ANASTASIUS: 	Don't be shy!

ANASTASIUS: 	Give your names! The slaves of God are baptised.
