VICTORIA	Tell me the truth.

GAYLE	He didn't do it.

VICTORIA	If you ever lie again, I swear.

HUNTER	I'm gonna keep my friends and my phone so I don't go to prison for murdering you.

DONALD	You don't want to know.

LILLY	Will this be in the press?

DONALD	No.  That's why I didn't call the police.

LILLY	But shouldn't we?

DONALD	No.  This is a matter of national security now.  Hey, I--I will know his every move from the moment he was born until the moment he entered this house in 24-hours.  Okay?

VICTORIA	Eating this late will give you more stretch marks.

GAYLE	Do you ever sleep?

VICTORIA	Yes.  Quite peacefully.  That's why I look so young.  Unlike you with those 50-year-old bags under your eyes.

GAYLE	You really are a mother of the year.

VICTORIA	Uh-hmm.  And you're daughter of the year.

GAYLE	Hmm.  How long before I can get the hell away from you?

VICTORIA	You keep talking to me like that and it will be sooner than you think.

GAYLE	Yeah, right.  Go to hell.

KYLE	Who's on the Chief's detail?

AGENT JERRY	Number 17, sir.

KYLE	All right.  I got it tonight.

AGENT JERRY	Sir, there's no need for that.

KYLE	(chuckles) Thank you, Jerry, but I got it.

AGENT JERRY	Sitting outside of a House is well below your pay grade, sir.

KYLE	It's also the job.

AGENT JERRY	(chuckles) Hmm, you got a thing for her?

KYLE	Are you kidding me right now?

AGENT JERRY	Hell, I do.

KYLE	You son of a bitch.

AGENT JERRY	Lighten up.

KYLE	Be respectful.

AGENT JERRY	When have you ever been respectful?

KYLE	(scoffs) Huh, if they get anything out of him, let me know.

AGENT JERRY	They won't.

KYLE	And how can you be so sure?

AGENT JERRY	Military tatts.  He's a Ranger.

KYLE	Break him.

AGENT JERRY	(sighs) I don't think I can.

KYLE	If you don't, I will.

AGENT JERRY	Sure, blood on your hands.

LILLY	So you'll see him?

DONALD	Maybe.

LILLY	Can I see him?

DONALD	Why would you wanna do that, hmm?

LILLY	How much will you know about him?

DONALD	(clicks tongue) As I said before, his every move.  What is it?

LILLY	I just…

DONALD	I know when you're not telling me something.

LILLY	I just wanna know about his family, does he have one?

DONALD	Oh.

LILLY	Or children?

DONALD	That should not be your concern.

LILLY	Well it is.

DONALD	Okay.  Hey.  You know what, you, you are such a compassionate soul.  You're gonna make a great mother one day.  Hmm.

LILLY	Well, we have to have sex for that to happen.

DONALD	Lilly.  (sighs)

LILLY	I'm sorry, it's--this night is just--you know what, I'm sorry.

BARRY	This is Barry, leave a message.

SHARON	(sighs) Barry, call me.  Hey, how is she?

RICHARD	Yeah, pills put her to sleep.

SHARON	Oh, good.

RICHARD	Do you know how Ruth took her?


SHARON	She said that Ruth and Callie were in the living room playing and then she let in some members of that cult.  And they held her down while Ruth and some of the other members took Callie.

RICHARD	Hmm.  Lord have mercy.

SHARON	Yup.

SHARON	I'll get it.

RICHARD	(sniffles) (sighs) Oh.

SHARON	Hey.

PICKY	How you doing?

SHARON	I'm good.

RICHARD	What the hell do you want?

PICKY	Barry came to see me.  Now he's out of his mind.  Now, I gave him a bad address for the Rakus, but it's just a matter of time until he finds 'em.  So, you might wanna go after him.

RICHARD	Where is he?

PICKY	I sent him over there by Rocky.  But he might be gone by now.

RICHARD	All right.

PICKY	And preach.

RICHARD	(sighs) What?

PICKY	He got a gun.

RICHARD	How the hell did he get a gun?

PICKY	He took it off from one of my boys.

RICHARD	Don't you mean your damn gang?

PICKY	I am just telling you, man.

RICHARD	Hey, stay with her.

SHARON	Hey.  What--wait, where are you going?

RICHARD	I'm gonna go find Barry.

SHARON	Oh, uh, wait, I tried tracking his phone, but it says it's at the White House.

RICHARD	Yeah.

SHARON	Why would he be there?

RICHARD	He forgot it.

SHARON	Okay.  Well, when you find him can you call me please?

RICHARD	Yeah, yeah.  Just take care of my wife.

SHARON	I will.  What's going on today? (sighs)

LILLY	(gasps) You scared the hell out of me.

KYLE	I'm sorry, ma'am.  I was just keeping watch.

LILLY	Where did they take him?

KYLE	Ma'am?

LILLY	Tell me.

KYLE	I'm sorry ma'am, that's top secret.

LILLY	So DC police will know this?

KYLE	No, ma'am.

LILLY	Is he okay?

KYLE	I'm not sure ma'am.

LILLY	Is he talking?

KYLE	Ma'am, I'm not sure.

LILLY	Okay.

KYLE	But if there's something that you need to say, I can listen.

LILLY	What do you mean?

KYLE	About tonight.

LILLY	I don't know what you mean.

KYLE	Is your husband asleep ma'am?

LILLY	I don't know.

KYLE	Well, you do know that we're trained in this.

LILLY	Yes.

KYLE	And nothing about this adds up with all due respect.

LILLY	Well, he came in here.

KYLE	Ma'am, I'm on your side.

LILLY	You work for my husband.

KYLE	I work for the good of the country.  Now if he happens to be okay and he starts to speaks, is there something that I should know?

LILLY	I don't know what you mean.

KYLE	Are you sure about that ma'am?

LILLY	I don't like your line of questioning.

KYLE	Yes, ma'am.  (sniffs) I'm sorry.

LILLY	Good night.

KYLE	Sleep tight ma'am.

PRISCILLA	Yes?

GAYLE	Where the hell did you come from?

PRISCILLA	You called ma'am.

GAYLE	No, I didn't.

PRISCILLA	Sorry.

GAYLE	How the hell do I get a secure line in this place?

PRISCILLA	Ma'am?

GAYLE	Are you deaf, or something, or just a stupid maid?

PRISCILLA	I'm neither.

GAYLE	Okay.  Then answer me.

PRISCILLA	What is your question ma'am?

GAYLE	You know, I can have you fired.

PRISCILLA	Okay.

GAYLE	Yeah.  And then what are you gonna do?  Go back on welfare?

PRISCILLA	Well if there's nothing else.

GAYLE	I want breakfast.  Where's the chef?

PRISCILLA	I am the chef.

GAYLE	Well, then cook.

PRISCILLA	Would you like it served here or in the dining room?

GAYLE	Do I look like I care?  Cook.

PRISCILLA	Yes, ma'am.

GAYLE	(sighs) God.  This is bullshit, I need a private line.

PRISCILLA	You can talk to Secret Service and they can…

GAYLE	Shut up, I didn't ask you.  (sighs) You know, I hope I don't get as fat as you have from your cooking.  You don't talk girl?  What's your name?

PRISCILLA	Priscilla Owen ma'am.

GAYLE	(scoffs) That's a stupid name.  Move.

JEAN	Sorry, I was getting dressed.

PRISCILLA	She wants breakfast.

JEAN	Are you okay?

PRISCILLA	I'm going to poison that stupid little bitch.

JEAN	What?

HUNTER	Oh.  (groans) Wow.

DENISE	How are you feeling?

DENISE	Then I did my job.

HUNTER	Yeah.  Yeah.

DENISE	Okay.  When will I see you again?

HUNTER	I'll call you.

DENISE	You better call me.

HUNTER	(chuckles) I will.

DENISE	And thank you for letting me visit this place, I mean, it's insane.

HUNTER	You're insane.

DENISE	You like this, don't you daddy?

HUNTER	I like it all.  Max.

MAX	Yes sir?

HUNTER	Make sure she gets home safe, all right?

MAX	Yes, sir.  Follow this gentleman, ma'am.

DENISE	Thank you.  He's cute Hunter.

HUNTER	No, no, no.  You only got eyes for me.

DENISE	I hear you.

HUNTER	Good night.

DENISE	Uh-hmm.

HUNTER	Ow.  That's gonna leave a mark.  Thank you Max.  I can always depend on you.

MAX	Your wife came down sir.

HUNTER	And?

MAX	Well, she wanted to get in.

HUNTER	Okay.

MAX	I didn't let her though so we're all clear.

HUNTER	I hope you knocked on her ass.

MAX	Well, it got physical sir and I think she's very upset.

HUNTER	(laughs) No, no, no, you don't understand.  My wife loves to be hit and slapped.  It turns her on.  It takes some getting used to.  In fact maybe you could take her off my hands.

MAX	No, sir.	

HUNTER	Come on, she's not that bad.

MAX	I'm just here to do my job sir.

HUNTER	Yeah.  But if you let her give you a blowjob, it would really help me out.  You think I'm kidding?

MAX	I hope so, sir.

HUNTER	You know, Denise has a twin sister, maybe you should meet her.  No, no, yeah.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Hey just make sure Denise is not on the visitor's list.

MAX	No, sir.  We took care of it.

HUNTER	(sighs) Thanks Max.  I can always depend on you.

MAX	You always will sir.

HUNTER	Oh.  I need a shower.  She does this thing with her--never mind.  Oh.

HUNTER	Oh, you're up.  (sighs)

VICTORIA	I'm sure your goons told you.

HUNTER	(clicks tongue) Yeah.

VICTORIA	So who's this one?

HUNTER	Go to bed.

VICTORIA	I asked you a question.

HUNTER	And I said go to bed.  (groaning) Bitch.

VICTORIA	Something wrong dear?

HUNTER	Oh, God.

VICTORIA	The next time one of your goons tries to keep me out of the Oval, it'll be his last.

HUNTER	Threats.  Threats.  Threats.

VICTORIA	Well, you know me.

HUNTER	Yeah, I do.

VICTORIA	I know who she is.

HUNTER	Yeah.  So?

VICTORIA	I think I'll pay her a visit.

HUNTER	Yeah, no.  No.  All those, uh, ghetto trips you used to make, those are down.

VICTORIA	You think so?

HUNTER	I know so and you have 24-hour Secret Service detail.

VICTORIA	I hope you need stitches.

HUNTER	Max is an expert, thanks to you.

DONALD	I thought I heard you talking to someone.

LILLY	Yeah.

DONALD	Who?

LILLY	Kyle.

DONALD	Kyle?

LILLY	Yeah.  He's out front.

DONALD	He's not supposed to be here.

LILLY	Well, he is.

DONALD	Well, what were you talking about?

LILLY	Um, he wanted to make sure if we're okay.

DONALD	No, he's not supposed to be here.

LILLY	Honey, I need you here.

DONALD	I'll be right back.

LILLY	Don't.

DONALD	What are you doing here, huh?

KYLE	Keeping watch sir.

DONALD	Where is Donovan?

KYLE	I relieved him sir.

DONALD	Why?

KYLE	I wanna be here.

DONALD	I want Donovan here.

KYLE	I got you covered sir.

DONALD	You can leave.

KYLE	Oh, well, I'm sorry sir but I can't do that.

DONALD	I don't need you to keep watch.

KYLE	You are my priority, sir.

DONALD	Do you know that I'm your superior?

KYLE	Yes, sir, I do.  That's why I'm here.

DONALD	I can make this really uncomfortable for you.

KYLE	We don't want that, sir.

DONALD	So you really got to do this?

KYLE	Sir, you just had a very traumatic…

DONALD	No.  We are--we are fine.

KYLE	Sir…

DONALD	No.  No.  Cut the "sir" shit.


KYLE	Well, I thought that's what you wanted, sir.

DONALD	You're really doing this?

KYLE	You are a high priority, sir.

DONALD	Kyle.  (sighs)

KYLE	Being here gives me comfort.  Please, please just allow me to look after you and your wife, sir.

DONALD	Outside, Kyle.

KYLE	Yes, sir.

JEAN	I'm sorry, sir.

JASON	You guys, get so nervous when you see us.

JEAN	I'm sorry.  We pride ourselves on invisible service.

JASON	What's that mean?

JEAN	Just that the cleaning, it should look like magic, not that you see us, so, excuse me.

JASON	How did you get this job?

JEAN	Most of the people here are generational so we all have a pack.

JASON	I'm sorry?

JEAN	There's never really ad for these types of jobs they are word of mouth.

JEAN	So my aunt worked here, and she helped me get the job.

JASON	Oh, okay.  Can you sit and talk?

JEAN	I'm sorry, sir, that's not allowed.

JASON	Where do you all live?

JEAN	There are staff quarters, sir.

JASON	Whoa, can you show me?

JEAN	Is there something that you need because I can gladly get it.

JASON	I just wanna see where you live.

JEAN	Okay.  Well, if you don't mind I--just let me check with the lead usher and I'm…

JASON	No.  No.  You asked if I wanted anything.

JEAN	Let me check, please, sir.

JASON	Okay.

NANCY	Are they back yet?

SHARON	No.  I thought you were asleep.

NANCY	I can't.

SHARON	I know.

NANCY	I'm sorry that he said those things to you.

SHARON	It's all right.

NANCY	He didn't mean it.

SHARON	Don't you always say that "What's in the heart speaks."

NANCY	(scoffs) That's the Bible.


SHARON	He meant it.

NANCY	No.

SHARON	He did.

NANCY	He was just upset.

SHARON	He said that to me before.

NANCY	What?

SHARON	That I'm not much of a mother to her.

NANCY	Oh, honey, you are.  You're great with her.

SHARON	She doesn't even like me.

NANCY	All kids they wanna see their parents together.

SHARON	Yeah.  Well, I just don't understand that he hooked with her in the first place.  That bitch.

NANCY	Well, she wasn't always that way.  They knew each other since they were little, we loved her.  We didn't know all the things that happened in that house when she grew up.  Her father he was--well, I can't even say it.  And I used to wonder why she never wanted to go home.

SHARON	I understand all that but that don't make it okay for her to take that baby.

NANCY	Everybody comes to a place from somewhere.

BARRY	(sighs) (sniffles) (sobbing)

RICHARD	I remember--I remember when your mama told me she was pregnant.  We were so happy.  When I found out it was boy, oh God, my heart went to pieces, in the most manly way, you know?  One look at you and I knew my life had changed.  I never knew that kind of love.  Then you grew up, you became so smart and just a--just a good kid, you never gave us any trouble.  But then you met Ruth and you had a baby of your own.  I know that anger because--I know that--that kind of love that makes you wanna kill to protect.  But you got to hear me, son, with all that's in me.  You can't do this.

SHARON	(sniffles) I'm gonna give him all of the time that he needs to get through this.  But I'm gotta tell you, I'm tired.  I'm tired of sitting around here, trying to be quiet, so that I don't upset him.

NANCY	Yeah.  Just…

SHARON	I can't do this.  I can't.

NANCY	Just give him time.

SHARON	I'm trying.  I'm really trying.  Oh God, what time is it?  (sighs)

NANCY	Oh, 6:30 AM.

SHARON	(sniffles) My God, where are they?

BARRY	I want my daughter.

RICHARD	And we're gonna get her.  Let's just--just give me the gun.

BARRY	I don't have a gun.

RICHARD	Oh, so we're lying to each other now?

BARRY	I wanna kill him.

RICHARD	Who?

BARRY	Whoever they call The Highest.  I wanna kill him.

RICHARD	Oh, no, no, son, if you--not, you're not gonna do that.

BARRY	Why not?
