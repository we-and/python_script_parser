("#CHANGEGONCOME (Gentrification)")
(Episode #109)

 

 
NOLA	Goooood mmmmorning. Almond Milk. Took six years and seven months to arrive at my Corner Bodega. Sure, it costs more than a Kidney BUT my Lactose intolerant Ass doesn’t have to trek across to Brooklyn Heights anymore for Almond Milk or Kombucha or Kale! Mmm! Exotic Produce! One of the many advents of Fort Greene’s Newer Residents or ‘Newbies’ as Stokely likes to say. But with Fresh Produce comes Increased Rents and Renovations. And for what? I used to play Dollies with Carmen Baxter when her Family still live next door. Wasn’t nothing wrong with that House. Still. The Baxters took a payout, moved down South to ATL and now someone sees fit to rattling my walls. Maybe renovations are a Newbie’s way of making Fort Greene feel more Theirs when The Fort is all of Ours. Hey, I get it. Change is necessary. Sometimes even Good but what if you’re not ready for Change? What then? Do you just get Steam-Rolled, Bull-Dozed and Bo- Garted? Most of the people I grew up with moved away after College. And who can blame ‘em? You go away to get a Degree, to Come home and pay Three times the Rent?

DR. JAMISON	Yet you’ve vigilantly remained.

NOLA	Brooklyn’s Home. I’m not leaving. No matter how much it changes or how Broke I get.

DR. JAMISON	Mm. Being Broke. That Ain’t No Joke. What I mean to say is, you’ve had a lot on your shoulders; financial struggles, your friend Shemekka...

NOLA	She’s a lot better.

DR. JAMISON	Good. But what about you? You got that tough Review.

NOLA	 I’m...Okay. Okay. Fine. But it’s not just the Review. My Art Life is in struggle mode. I’m creating work all the time. But I keep wondering if I’m ever gonna make it as an Artist or if I’ll end up like Papo, the Neighborhood Bum who was a Damn Good Artist in High School but who just couldn’t survive all the change.

 
DR. JAMISON	That’s an understandable fear. Would you feel more secure if you didn’t have to juggle your Art Aspirations and your Relationships?

NOLA	You say that like they’re a distraction.

DR. JAMISON	Well can you focus with Three Boyfriends?

NOLA	They’re not my Boyfriends.

DR. JAMISON	I’m sorry. Lovers. And Opal. That’s four. That’s gotta be challenging.

NOLA	I may have slipped up a Time or Two. Called one by the other’s name but I don’t confuse their Energy.

DR. JAMISON	Okay. But is their Energy feeding your voice as an Artist?

NOLA	Well. They each bring something different out of me.

DR. JAMISON	Tell me about that.

NOLA	With Mars I laugh ‘til my Sides hurt. We just have Fun, ya know? He makes me feel like a Kid again.

DR. JAMISON	And Greer?

NOLA	Greer’s spontaneous and surprisingly Cultured. Nothing’s ever the same with him. Certainly not the Sex.

DR. JAMISON	And Jamie?

NOLA	It’s so complicated....

DR. JAMISON	Of course. The estranged Wife.

NOLA	It was convenient at first. Him taking my Broke Ass to Expensive Dinners? Buying my Art when no one else would? But it’s shifted. I care about him and he cares about me, like no one ever has.

DR. JAMISON	Not even your Parents?

NOLA	Jamie’s Grown. I love that Energy. He’s a nurturing Parent. It’s the same with Opal. She’s the kind of Woman I aspire to be.

DR. JAMISON	You’ll get there, in your own time. Well. It sounds like all together your Lovers make the Perfect Mate.

NOLA	But you don’t think that’s Smart.

DR. JAMISON	I didn’t say that.

NOLA 	’ve got it under wraps Dr. Jamison. For one, Opal’s not a problem. I don’t see anyone more than Twice a Week. No Two Lovers in one day. No Sex without a Condom. And no Sex if it ain’t in my Lovin’ Bed.

DR. JAMISON	You’ve got a lot of rules there.

NOLA	I gotta have some kind of control.

DR. JAMISON	Or what? Let’s go back to your Art Opening.

NOLA	Do we have to? That was weeks ago.

DR. JAMISON	I know. And I know it was tough but I think it’s a great opportunity to examine your ability to maintain control.

NOLA	Or lack of ability. I nearly bust that White Boy’s Ass.

DR. JAMISON	Understandable. But, Him aside, how did it feel with all of your Lovers in one Space?

NOLA	Frantic. Crazy. Like I had to put out a lot of Fires.

DR. JAMISON	What would have happened if you just let the Fires burn?

NOLA	What? I couldn’t.

DR. JAMISON	But it was your Night. And instead of being present for your Art...

NOLA	...I chose to put out the Fires. Shit.

DR. JAMISON	Don’t beat up on yourself. Nola. You are a Vibrant and Beautiful Young Female Artist. You should be enjoying your Life.

NOLA	Yeah but isn’t it time to grow up Responsibilities and Shit? Saturn Return is a time for decisions that could effect my Future, who I end up with but I’m putting out Fires!

DR. JAMISON	I don’t want you to feel pressured to choose but the Reality is each Lover will likely want more of your Time and your heart. What will you have left for yourself? For your Art? Can I make a suggestion? Opal, was always transparent with you. Maybe it’s time to take a page from her Book. Maybe full disclosure will lift the burden you’re carrying and steer you clear of turning your male Lovers into a Three-Headed Monster.

NOLA	A Three-Headed Monster....

BIANCA TATE	C’mon sweetie. Ready for your walk...? TO finish up, I appreciate everyone coming out tonight. We’re going to wrap this up. I know you have other thing you need to do. So I’ll reach out to the Community Board with ideas for what should replace that Strip Club.

STOKLEY	The Hot-N-Trot is Burlesque! There’s a difference! So I heard.

BIANCA TATE	Okay. One final Order of Business. As you may know, some Heartless Thug has been defacing our Homes and Businesses with a Large Green

STOKLEY	For Gentrification. Don’t forget that part!

MAX	Graffiti has been here before us. It’ll be here after we’re gone!

BIANCA TATE	Mr. Max. Are you suggesting we accept the defacement of our Brownstones?

MAX	No I just think there are Bigger Fish to Fry. Like why have they kicked the Black and Brown Men out The Park simply for playing Soccer?!

BIANCA TATE	There were noise complaints...but we’re talking Vandalism. And it’s clear who the culprit is! Papo.

PAPO	Nah, you got the wrong Dominican.

NOLA	Papo? Naw.

BIANCA TATE	Oh Yes.

SEPTIMA	Let’s leave the Man alone.

BIANCA TATE	I’m sorry but he clearly has an agenda to scare the Newer Neighbors in Fort Greene!

RACHEL	Papo’s Cool. He helped me move in Two Years back. I gave him a few bucks for helping.

BIANCA TATE	See. He’s a Hustler!

RACHEL	He’s an Artist! Have you seen his Work?

BIANCA TATE	 No but I’ve smelled the Mess he’s left after going through my Garbage to make ‘Art’!

SHELLY	He does leave quite a Mess.

DOUG	We paid a lot to have our vestibule renovated and to see it covered in trash...

PAPO	Oh The Terror! The Trashy Mess! Children starving The World over. Patriarchy staining Young Minds and Vaginas! The FBI classifies Black Lives Matter as a Hate Group. But what to do about Papo’s trashy mess!

RACHEL	Black Lives Matter.

BIANCA TATE	White Lives ... I mean All Lives Matter. Mock us if you will. The Trash Attracts Rats! And Rats are a Health Hazard! Am I right?! Hello?

STOKLEY	Look, Papo is a part of this Community, okay?

MAX	He’s the Mayor of the Block!

BIANCA TATE	He’s not MY Mayor. I did NOT Vote for Papo! The Man is a Mental Case!

NOLA	You’re right, Bianca Tate! You’re right Bianca Tate, Papo has some Mental Issues. He’s seen all kinds of horrible things in Afghanistan defending The Red, White and Blue for everybody in this room, In Bk. In The US of A!

BIANCA TATE	Okay. OKAY! Calm down everyone. I hear you Nola. I respect anyone who serves. But the Man is a Vagrant.

MAX	Papo is a Human Being! I bet you treat your overpriced Dog better.

PAPO	Woof! Woof!

BIANCA TATE	I resent that! My Miss. Jiggles is a Service Dog, Thank You!

STOKLEY	It’s Newbies like you who stopped that Shelter from being built on Park Ave! Maybe if ya hadn’t, Papo’d have a place to go!

BIANCA TATE	Okay so I don’t want to live next to Homeless People. So I care about the value of my Brownstone! That makes me, The Bad Guy!?

MAX	Pretty much!

PAPO	I’m not homeless. I’m transitioning.

SEPTIMA	Stop it! Would you look at yourselves!? We’re to set the example for the young Folk in this Community. I, for one, did not come here to gang up on Miss Tate.

BIANCA TATE	Thank you.

SEPTIMA	Sure her Designer Panties are Tightly bound! But our differences are what makes Fort Greene great. Look. New Folks gonna come. Old Heads gonna stay! But we gotta find a way to make this work. We should have a Pot Luck and use the day to get to know each other better. Am I right?

STOKLEY	Can I ask a question?

BIANCA TATE	The floor is all yours

STOKLEY	This is the last thing I’m gonna say: ÒTo be or not to be, That’s the motherfuckin’ quesiton.Ó

NOLA	Romare Bearden is The Collagist of our time. A Black Man. In his picture ‘Young Students’, he creates a Street Scene. Today, we’re going to create Collages that express what our Neighborhoods look and feel like.

KERVON	But what if I can’t find no Pics of Big Bootied Girls?

NOLA	Ignore him! Guys, don’t think too much about it. If an Image jumps out, cut it out and put it aside, okay? Let’s get to it. Guys keep it down, okay? Reggie are you on your Phone?

REGGIE	But Ms. Darling...

NOLA	... You know Phones aren’t allowed in class...

REGGIE	...But, it’s you, Ms. Darling!

NOLA	What?

HASSAN	Word. That’s you aight!

NOLA	Shit.

KIDS	Oooooh.

REGGIE	Shut up. Can’t y’all see Miss Darling shook?!

KERVON	So you Famous now, Ms. Darling?

HASSAN	Ms. Darling, How many likes you got?

REGGIE	Like 2000!

NOLA	Really, Clo? Really?!

CLORINDA	I’m sorry, Tat. Give us a second? Is there a problem? I’ve known Nola Darling for quite some time but once I saw her powerful Campaign for My Name Isn’t, I knew this Street Artist would be the Art World’s next Force of Nature. You’re welcome?

NOLA	I didn’t want this out.

CLORINDA	No? Well that Post alone got over 50,000 views. Do you know how many times I’ve seen the My Name Isn’t Hashtag?

NOLA	That’s not the point.

CLORINDA	I’m sorry. What is the point?

NOLA	It’s not what I...who told you?

CLORINDA	Who else? Mars. He was concerned about how Broke you’ve been. And I’m trying to understand why you’re so upset right now.

NOLA	‘Street Artist’?

CLORINDA	Did I lie?

NOLA	It’s One Series of Fuckin’ Work. It came out of my Assault. I’m more than that!

CLORINDA	And who would know this? Aside from me and your Parents and the Folks who came to the Group show? You’re a Real Talent, Nola! IT’S TIME TO SHINE!

NOLA	Not like this.

CLORINDA	Well how then? Like it or not, adversity serves you. Brings out your best and THIS is your best Work yet! I don’t know why you kept it from me for so long. It’s Bold. Fierce! Unapologetically Feminist and Fearlessly Anti-Mysoganist! This is should’ve been in The Group Show!

NOLA	That’s not for you to decide.

CLORINDA	Well thanks to that Post, people are interested, my Friend. Several inquiries were made in the last hour alone. One is a Celebrity Client whose identity I can’t yet reveal. Let’s just say his name rhymes with SHMEnny SHMABitZ! Okay?! You don’t look happy.

NOLA	I’m not.

CLORINDA	I just helped launch your Career in a Big Way. Any other Artist would kill for that kind of exposure but all you’re giving me is attitude!

NOLA	Because you never asked me!


CLORINDA	Like you did with Mars?


NOLA	What? You keep bringing that up. What, you wanna fucking share?

CLORINDA	Forget it, I did this because I knew it was the Boost you needed.

NOLA	You don’t know everything, Ms. Bradford.

CLORINDA	No but I know more than you about how this Art World works, Ms. Darling.
 
NOLA	Word. Do you know more than me? Do you know that I’m about to walk the Fuck away from The New Medina Art Gallery right now?

CLORINDA	Nola... Really?! So you just want to hide! Like some scared Little Girl?!

NOLA	(to Tatyana) Good luck with that.

CUSTOMER	Mars, Do you customize skateboards here at Joey Chainz.

MARS	Do we customize skateboards? Is Mars Blackmon Puerto Rican? Of course We customize. For a mere Hunnit more, We put whatever you want on there: Eat a Bag! Kick, Push! My Lambo In Da Shop. I Like Big Booty Girls.

CUSTOMER	I do like Big Booty Girls.

NOLA	Why? Are you gonna RESCUE me again?

MARS	What’s up, Ma? I get off in a few..

Illumination to better see themselves? I don’t know. You’ve been so supportive. You’ve taught me that People really can give from a genuine place. But what I need most now is understanding. If I’m going to make it, I need to know that the Greatest Lift is one I can give to myself. I have to Trust that the Universe send Signals that I’m on the right Path. God is Great. I got The Grant. I Got The Great. Something is happening Jamie. If I’m being H onest, there IS someone else......Me.
