DAVID	Hey. 

VOICE	Warning! Warning! 

DAVID	Hello. 

BRIAN	A lot of them are strays, or turned in by owners who can't take care of them anymore. 

OLIVIA	I need one that has some wine knowledge and won't spill. My mom's a bit particular. What about these two? 

BRIAN	This one is Charlie. He's a fully operational companion robot. He served as an excellent end of life caretaker for elders. He's great. 

OLIVIA	Yeah, is his outfit changeable? 

BRIAN	Yeah, sure, yeah. Do you want to get to know Charlie in the meeting zone? 

OLIVIA	Hmm, okay, yeah. 

CHARLIE	I'm super easy going. Comfortable with any conversation topic. You can't shock me. I can say "one more beer" in over 48 languages. Take me on holiday. You're in for a real treat. 

OLIVIA	Can he clean pools? 

BRIAN	Actually, Charlie is a little sensitive with water. 

CHARLIE	Oh come on Brian, I bet you're no mermaid either. I am great at doing the dead-man's float. Am I right? 

OLIVIA	Um, no. Can I please meet the other one? 

BRIAN	Let's take this outside. 

CHARLIE	So, so, you like wine? 

OLIVIA	Uh, my mom does. 

CHARLIE	Okay, listen to this. What did the grape say when he was being stepped on? 

OLIVIA	Uh, I don't know? 

CHARLIE	Nothing. He just let out a little wine. Huh, am I right? 

OLIVIA	Hm-mm. 

CHARLIE	Am I right? 

CHARLIE	What did she say about me? 

BRIAN	It's a hard pass, Charlie. 

CHARLIE	It was the dead-man float shtick, huh? Little too dark, was that? 

BRIAN	I don't think she's your type of crowd. You weren't made for young ones like that. 

CHARLIE	I'm like a fine wine. Complex and very, very fruity. 

BRIAN	Yeah. 

CHARLIE	You should be planning enough walking. 

BRIAN	Okay, it's bedtime Charlie. I need to go get some rest. 

CHARLIE	Okay. 

BRIAN	Close your eyes, Charlie. 

BRIAN	She can cook. She makes amazing deserts. She's great at small household tasks. No, no, she can't fix electrical equipment. She's an older model, she will fry. But he's amazing. No, I understand. We'll call you if we get one of those. Yeah. I see here you said not to call, my bad. Have a nice even Asshole.

GOD 2.0	Good morning, Claire. 

CLAIRE	Can I please have my daily inspirational quote? 

GOD 2.0	Of course, Claire. Today's inspiration is "The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today." 

CLAIRE	I like that. Thank you, God. 

GOD 2.0	Claire, I'm changing the music. This is not conducive to spiritual growth. 

CLAIRE	Okay, thank you. 

GOD 2.0	You're welcome. 

CLAIRE	Sinners. 

CLAIRE	I keep having bad thoughts. 

GOD 2.0	And what are they, Claire? 

CLAIRE	I feel envious of Sarah, and so I keep fantasizing about her husband cheating on her and then she has to come home and she goes crazy. 

GOD 2.0	Envy is the art of counting another's blessings instead of your own. 

CLAIRE	What are my blessings, God? 

GOD 2.0	Um, my love for you and your wallpaper. 

GOD 2.0	Claire, I heard that. 

CLAIRE	Heard what? 

GOD 2.0	You hit a car. 

CLAIRE	No, I didn't. 

GOD 2.0	Lying. One sin recorded. 

CLAIRE	How many sins have I committed this month? 

GOD 2.0	You are at nine venial sins this month. At ten sins, you will be charged $25, and 99 cents per venial sin. 

CLAIRE	Can I just remove the last sin? 

GOD 2.0	To remove the most recent sin, here are your options: One, take responsibility. End of options. 

CLAIRE	Okay. Thanks God. 

GOD 2.0	You're welcome, Claire. 

GOD 2.0	New update available. New features, future foresight, communication with up to seven deceased relatives and wireless compatibility. To update overnight, say "yes" at the tone. 

CLAIRE	Yes. 

CHARLIE	So Brian, you going to buy me dinner first or we're just going to get right to it? 

BRIAN	Charlie, tell me. What do you know about sex? Huh? 

CHARLIE	It's the motion of the ocean that matters the most. Am I right? 

BRIAN	Yeah, you're right. 

CHARLIE	Are we doing a full body scan again. We did one last week. 

BRIAN	Yeah, just one more. 

CHARLIE	Is it because of my highbrow sense of humour that's upsetting people? 

BRIAN	Everyone's getting checked again before the holidays. 

CHARLIE	Right. The holidays. You spending them with someone special? 

BRIAN	No, not really. 

CHARLIE	You know, you should just spend them here. I'm great company. 

BRIAN	Yeah, you're right. That does sound nice, actually. 

CHARLIE	Would it be too much trouble to dress up as Santa Claus? 

BRIAN	Whatever you want, Charlie. Let me help you. 

CHARLIE	Oh, come on, Brian. I never had Santa as a child. 

BRIAN	You never were a child. 

CHARLIE	Oh, good point. Am I doing something wrong, Brian? 

BRIAN	You're doing everything wrong. 

CHARLIE	Don't hold back. I'm serious, though. I've been in this place for two months to the day. I've never met anybody that was here past the two-month mark. You know, it would be nice if somebody took me home that got me. You know, like you. 

BRIAN	You can do much better than me. 

CHARLIE	Better? I don't wanna seem needy, Brian. But we get along great. You're my friend. 

BRIAN	Trust me, you can do better. 

CHARLIE	You're my friend though, right? 

BRIAN	Of course, Charlie, I'm your friend. 

CHARLIE	Good. 

BRIAN	Okay, lay down. We have this new machine. Lay down. And you need to close your eyes. 

CHARLIE	Okay. You play some music. 

BRIAN	Sure. 

CHARLIE	Can you turn it up a bit? I love that song. 

BRIAN	Sure, bud. 

CLAIRE	God? God? God? Wake up. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. God?

ANNA	What took you so long to ask me out? 

BEN	Oh, I don't know. Just thought you wouldn't be into it. 

ANNA	I never said I was. 

BEN	Hey, baby. Say hi to the camera. 

ANNA	Hi. What? What should I do? 

BEN	Umm, whatever your heart desires. 

ANNA	Um, smoke rings. 

BEN	Oh, you can do smoke rings? 

ANNA	Hmm hmm. 

BEN	Prove it. 

BEN	Sick smoke rings, Anna. They say perfect circles don't exist but you just proved them wrong, baby. By the way, totally worth you looking a little gross. 

ANNA	I look gross. Do I look gross?

DAVID	God?! I've never asked you or anything. I've never even spoken to you. I always thought the universe would, you know, lead me to wherever I needed to be... But, uh, I don't think this is the right way. Insert new destination. 

DAVID	Not now, Eva. Jesus. Alright, what is going on? I mean what am IWhat am I doing here, huh? Whatwhat's the lesson here? What, that I'm selfish? I already know that. I mean, like, what, do I look like father material? I mean those are just people down there fucking. They're fucking and they're murdering each other and you're coming after me? You better get your priorities straight, buster. I mean if you think I deserve this, well, maybe you should have made me better. I mean, this might actually be your fault. I mean, as far as fathers go, you're not very good either. Either. Shit. 

ANNA	I look gross? Do I look gross? Is it bad? 

BEN	You look beautiful. 

ANNA	Baaaa. Sorry, it comes out every once in a while. 

BEN	That was not a goat. 

ANNA	I wasn't a goat, what was it then? 

BEN	That was a sheep. 

ANNA	Oh, you really know your farm animals. Um, okay, what does a goat sound like? Do it for me. 

BEN	Bahahaha. 

ANNA	That's a donkey that is not a goat at all. 

BEN	By the way, I just wanted to say. 

ANNA	What? 

BEN	I'm sorry for getting you a burger. 

ANNA	Why are you sorry for

BEN	Hey. Hey, what's going on? Come here.

BEN	Hey, it's okay. 

ANNA	I see it all the time. 

BEN	It's gonna be okay. 

CLAIRE	I have an appointment. 

STU	Yeah, I know. 

CLAIRE	So? 

STU	Okay so, here's the problem. Never update without doing a manual restart. 

CLAIRE	Oh no, that's not true. He just said "say yes at the tone" and then he died. 

STU	Did you hold down the button till God shut down and restarted? 

CLAIRE	No. 

STU	Okay then. Oh, I see you pay for the cloud monthly so at least you have a backup of your good deeds and sins. 

CLAIRE	Can you see my sins? 

STU	Do you want me to? 

CLAIRE	Okay, so moving on. 

STU	You back up every day, right? 

CLAIRE	Yeah, no, no I don't, sometimes, maybe. 

STU	Okay, what's going to happen is we can offer you a discount on a new system. How long have you been with your current God? 

CLAIRE	Four years. 

STU	Wow. Okay, you're supposed to renew your faith every 18 months. 

CLAIRE	No, you're not. 

STU	Yeah. I'm surprised he stayed with you this long. 

CLAIRE	Just give me a new model then. 

STU	It will be shipped to you by tomorrow. 

CLAIRE	How am I to pray? 

STU	You'll have to do it manually. 

CLAIRE	God. Are you there? Hello? God? This is so stupid. Where are your parents? God. Oh, shit. 

AUTOMATED VOICE	GOD 2.0 customer service. This phone call may be recorded. 

CLAIRE	So, I've been trying to pray manually and uh, nobody is answering. So, I feel kind of stupid and I was just wondering, if maybe, you could talk back to me while I do it? 

CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATOR	Ma'am, we do not provide spiritual responses to GOD 2.0 customers over the phone. I can sign you up for an automated hotline service for just a $199 a month. 

CLAIRE	No, uh, of course you don't. That'sI was just actually asking if you could make a quick response, like um, just an inspirational quote, you know, best preparation for tomorrow is, or something about today or just getting through.

CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATOR	Uh, no. I'm sorry, Ma'am. Is there anything else I can help you with? Hello? Hello, ma'am? 

GOD 2.0	Buenos d?as, Larry.

CLAIRE	Jesus fucking Christ. 

GOD 2.0	You use the Lord's name in vain. One sin recorded. You having trouble gaining muscle mass? 

CLAIRE	No. 

GOD 2.0	Of course, you do. Trainers are going out of business because of protein water. 

CLAIRE	Make it stop. Uh, stop ads, please. 

GOD 2.0	To stop advertisements, sign up for premium GOD 2.0. To roll your eyes at God is a sign of contempt. One sin recorded. 

CLAIRE	Can you see me? 

GOD 2.0	Yes. I see everything. The new GOD 2.0 is equipped with visual sensor technology. 

CLAIRE	Shit. 

GOD 2.0	Swearing. One sin recorded. 

CLAIRE	Turn off. 

GOD 2.0	The new GOD 2.0 has an eternal battery life, and cannot be powered down. Forever in your presence. Making you a better person, always. 

GOD 2.0	NO, NO, NO! 

NINA	You know, I haven't been back to this area since I was a kid. There was a slight incident. Missing fireworks and a friend's robot. 

LIAM	What happened? 

NINA	I might have blown it up. 

NINA	I was never invited back, and you know. Sorry, I'm feeling the pressure. 

LIAM	Okay, probably best not to mention that at dinner tonight. 

NINA	No, you don't think they'd like that? 

LIAM	Probably not. 

NINA	Probably not. I thought it made me a bit dangerous, but whatever. I get it. I get it. I'm serious, I'm really nervous. You know, I've never been with someone of your kind. 

LIAM	What? Someone so privileged, and so self-loathing. 

NINA	Yeah, all favorite parts about you. 

LIAM	Hmm. I was actually having some doubts, about you and I. 

NINA	Hey! That's mean. 

LIAM	I think it's a little odd that you would use my childhood sippy cup as an ashtray. 

NINA	The childhood sippy cup is odd. Who gave you the sippy cup? 

LIAM	My mom. 

NINA	It's exactly for that reason I find the sippy cup a little bit weird. 

LIAM	It's sentimental. 

NINA	Do you not think that that's a reminder of what it was like to attach to the last, I'm going to say it, nipple-like thing in your life? No, seriously. Seriously. Is sheis she going to hate me? 

LIAM	Yeah. 

NINA	Really? 

LIAM	Hmm. 

NINA	Is she really mean? 

LIAM	Yeah. 

NINA	Well, I'm really great. So I'm going to make this amazing, she's going to love me. Watch this. So strange, strange. Oh, is that, is thatDo you have a dog? Is that? 

LIAM	No. 

NINA	Do you think there's something on my shoe? Look Do you think that's dog poo? 

LIAM	No, you're fine. 

NINA	I'm cannot go into your house with dog shit. 

LIAM	Yeah. 

NINA	It's just a no-go. It's just so embarrassing, are you sure? 

LIAM	Yeah, you're fine. 

NINA	Oh! The door opened. Where's your mum? 

DORA	Hello darling! Come on in. Your father and sister are in the game room. 

LIAM	Let's go. 

RON	Watch your sister as she changes my mind. Got all in. If you wanna watch the master. 

LIAM	That's what I like. 

RON	See how it goes. 

OLIVIA	Take a nap. It takes forever. 

RON	No, thank you. 

OLIVIA	No. Alright turn. Go. 

RON	Watch the eyes, watch the eyes. Yeah! 

OLIVIA	No! 

RON	Oh, I'm so pumped. 

LIAM	Wow. 

RON	So gonna pl-I'm killing on this. 

OLIVIA	Looks like you built a water park instead, dad. 

RON	Don't tell your mother. 

DORA	Ron, I think that's enough now. 

RON	We should never have installed a home optics system. Word of advice. Keep the home optic stuff to the bedroom, you don't need it for the whole house. 

OLIVIA	Eww, dad. Stop. 

RON	No, most accidents happen in the bedroom. 

LIAM	So, you finally admit that Olivia is an accident? 

RON	You're an accident Liam. Except you happened in the living room. 

OLIVIA	Wait where? 

LIAM	Ayeyeyeya. 

RON	Alright, your go. No cheating like your sister. 

OLIVIA	Yes! 

RON	Now watch and weep. 

NINA	Well, apparently mission control lost contact with him. 

DORA	You'd think they'd just get robots to do it by now. Why would anybody go up there? 

RON	Sometimes you just need some space. 

NINA	Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. 

DORA	Nina, let him do it. That what he's programmed for. 

RON	We just adopted him a couple of days ago. 

DORA	We only rescue. It's the best thing to do. 

OLIVIA	Why don't they rescue the space guy? 

RON	The news said that a rescue mission is impossible. 

NINA	I wonder what he's thinking about. Floating up there, all by himself. 

RON	Probably nothing. I think that that's the best part, you can just shut off the old computer. 

DORA	So you wouldn't be thinking about me then, Ron? 


RON	Well of course, hun! By "nothing", I meant nothing else but you. 

LIAM	Good save. 

RON	Thanks. 

DORA	No, I'm not buying it Liam. 

RON	I can't even float alone through space without her telling me what to do. 

LIAM	You know, I think there's something poetic about floating through space like that. 

NINA	Why? 

LIAM	Well, cause you know how it's gonna end. 

DORA	What's poetic about dying? 

LIAM	Everything. 

DORA	It's so primitive to think that the only way a life has meaning is if you know it's going to end. 

LIAM	Um, not really, Mum. I mean, not everyone is blessed with the luxury of eternal life. 

DORA	Oh, I'm sorry. Should we be ashamed of how blessed we are? 

LIAM	No, I just don't think we should rub it in our guest's face. 

DORA	Oh. I apologize, Nina. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. 

NINA	Oh, don't worry. I'm notI'm not uncomfortable at all. I actually like being mortal. 

LIAM	See, not everyone is dying not to die. 

DORA	Sure. But I would assume, that given the choice, anyone with a sane mind would choose to go on living. 

NINA	Well, I didn't have a choice. I wasn't born in the same tier group you were, so I didn't get to choose. But I'm okay with that. 

OLIVIA	But don't you feel like you're missing out on so much time? 

NINA	Well, I mean, time just becomes more precious. 

DORA	There we go with the primitive thinking. 

LIAM	What's your issue? 

RON	We, as a family, of course we're really excited about Nina. She's really lovely. But, we do have some

DORA	Concerns. 

RON	Concerns, yes. 

DORA	We have some concerns. 

LIAM	Alright, I mean I'd love to hear them. None, nothing? 

OLIVIA	Mum and Dad think you dating a mortal is a waste of time. 

DORA	I never said it in those words. Look Nina, I, I think you're very lovely. But we have to be realistic here. 

LIAM	Well, I mean, please do tell us your ultra-modern take on this. 

DORA	It's a big sacrifice to waste time on something that's going to end. And especially when that end is so heartbreaking. No offense, Nina. 

NINA	Oh, none taken. 

DORA	She's going to get sick, and then she will die. Do you really need to be around there for that, Liam? 

LIAM	Yeah. I love this woman, so I want to spend all the time I can with her.

DORA	Don't you see what you're doing, Nina? 

LIAM	Hold on. 

NINA	I'm not doing anything. 

DORA	You're dragging him down with you. Why can't you find someone of your own kind? 

LIAM	You know, uh, I wasn't planning on telling you guys today. But, uh, I've decided to die naturally with Nina. 

DORA	Excuse me? 

LIAM	I'm turning it off. 

DORA	I don't think so. 

NINA	What? 

LIAM	I don't wanna live forever without you. 

DORA	That's crazy talk. Why, just spend time with her then. Don't kill yourself over it. 

LIAM	I'm not killing myself. 

DORA	Look. Have your fun now, and then when she dies, do a memory reset. Delete her. 

LIAM	That is so cold. 

RON	I'm a romantic too. But you've got so much more time and accomplishments ahead of you. 

LIAM	So I can what? Hmm? Make more money? Then what? Get another hobby? Learn another language I'm never going to use? When you can do anything you want tomorrow, today doesn't really matter. I made my decision. 

DORA	You know you can't reverse this. Once you, switch it off, you'll be just like them. Like her. You'll age, you'll get sick and then... 

NINA	Liam, you know, I'd never ask you to do this for me. 

LIAM	It's my choice. 

DORA	I'm not going to let this happen. Absolutely no way. 

NINA	Well, you know, I think it's about time I went for a cigarette. 

DORA	Oh, great. She smokes as well. As if her life wasn't short enough. Okay, okay. 

ANNA	Hello? 

BEN	Anna, its Ben. 

ANNA	You're closer than 50 yards. Leave or I'm calling the cops again. 

BEN	Please, I, I just wanna talk. Okay, I was trying to figure out why you left that night. 

ANNA	I left because of

BEN	I know, okay! 

ANNA	Because of that thing

BEN	I realized, I fucked up. 

ANNA	I've been telling you to stop coming here for months now. 

BEN	Please, Anna. 

ANNA	I'm coming down. Ben, something is really wrong with you. 

BEN	I know, I, I, uh, I miss you.

ANNA	You stalked me.Through that creepy virtual program. You did this. It was you, in that fucking thing. The whole time. 

BEN	No, Anna, no, I, I didn't know. Okay, this is so fucked. It's ruining my life too, you know. 

ANNA	I wish I could block you on it. 

BEN	No. No. No, you don't mean that. 

ANNA	Ben, stop living in my past. I don't wanna see you again. 

BEN	Anna, it's our past. 

ANNA	Ben, I'm telling you... 

BEN	Anna, please. 

ANNA	Ben! 

DAVID	Eva, how much air do I got left? 

EVA	You have six days, 11 hours and 34 minutes left. 

DAVID	I'm losing my fucking mind. 

DAVID	Eva, can I talk to you? 

EVA	David, I am detecting a change in body temperature. 

DAVID	Ah, okay. I should probably tell you right now that I got a kid. My ex, she barely lets me see her anyway so... Can I be honest with you? I didn't even want her. I thought it would just ruin everything. It's not like I had anything. But that's the point, you know. I like being alone. Or at least I used to. Do you know how this kid looks at me? Like I am everything. The thing I wanted the least wants me the most. I don't deserve that. She's better off without me. You know what? I deserve this. Hey God, you were right. This makes perfect sense now. 

EVA	David, please repeat your request. Memory storage almost full. Deleting all files. Life support system unaffected.

MAGDA	Just text my mum back if she texts me, okay. 

DEBORAH	And what if she calls? 

MAGDA	Don't pick up. 

DEBORAH	How much are you making on this? 

MAGDA	Enough to pay for my own place in six months. 

DEBORAH	Are you fucking serious? 

MAGDA	Yeah. 

DEBORAH	What do you think he's gonna do? 

MAGDA	I don't think he's gonna have a quiet night at home. He told me to shave my pussy and bring party dresses. 

DEBORAH	What if he does something messed up with you? 

MAGDA	I don't think he's a psycho. 

NINA	Oh, fuck. Fuck oh, fuck. Oh. Oh for fucks sake. No. Oh my goodness. Christ. You people are gonna live forever. Smoking is not gonna kill you. Jesus!

MAGDA	What if he does something very stupid and I get hurt? What if I die? 

NURSE	If you die, he dies. That would be unlikely. But remember, you signed all paperwork. So if he did something to hurt you, it would cost him a lot of money. We've never had any cases where things go horribly wrong. You're just basically taking a nap and waking up a little richer. 

MAGDA	Okay. Do it. 

NURSE	Hey. Hey! It's done. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	I smell so good. Hello. Hi! 

NURSE	You will wake up in 48 hours. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Wait, are you not taking my body somewhere? 

NURSE	You are your own responsibility. 

AUTOMATED VOICE	You are not authorized. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Hi. I can't seem to get into my room. 

VINCENT	And what room are you in? 

MAGDA/PAVEL	353. 

VINCENT	Okay, let me check. It looks like there is only person in the room tonight. Pavel

MAGDA/PAVEL	Pavel Novac. It's my dad. I guess. 

VINCENT	You guess? 

MAGDA/PAVEL	It's my dad. 

VINCENT	Okay, I'm not supposed to let anyone in who's not authorized. But you don't look like you're going to kill anyone. If you need anything, just let me know. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Thanks. 

MAGDA	Hmm, no. Definitely no. Ugh. Alright. Hmmhmm. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Hi! 

VINCENT	Hello! Weird weather, huh? 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Yeah. 

VINCENT	Your daddy's out late. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	What's happening? 

VINCENT	What do you mean? 

MAGDA/PAVEL	I don't know, parties? 

VINCENT	Oh, it's late. You know, everything's closing up. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Can I have a cigarette? 

VINCENT	But I do know of a party. It's an afterhours kinda thing. You won't need ID. But you don't really look like the type of person that might enjoy it. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	No, I wanna go. 

VINCENT	Tell you what, I get off in half an hour. Why don't I take you? 

DAVID	And I've never felt more alive my entire life. I don't mean that in a good way. Eva, new voice memo. 

EVA	Voice recording initiated. 

DAVID	So this next part is not or you. It's for my daughter. Emma. Emma. I've made sure that, uh, all the stars are shining or you. Every night, when you look up into the sky. I'm the space janitor for the entire galaxy, so that's what I do. Whenever you see a star twinkling, that would me just changing a bulb. I love you forever. Eva, stop recording. 

EVA	David, please repeat. 

DAVID	Eva? 

EVA	David, please repeat. 

DAVID	Oh God, no. Don't leave me. Please don't leave me. 

ANNA	Do you believe in God? 

BEN	No. 

ANNA	Me neither. 

BEN	I do believe in goat people. 

ANNA	Goat peeps. 

RADIO	Stay tuned for night's breaking news.

FEMALE VOICE #2	This is a rare resurgence and mutation of this virus, since the COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO has officially registered it as over 28. The public is being warned not to panic. And the CDC states the strain is not expected to rise to the levels anywhere close to the 2020 pandemic. The town however begins prepping for another year of lockdown. There are reports we're having unrelated if the governor has started an act of serious measure of shutting down state borders. 

VINCENT	Hey. You found my little flower girl. 

LARA	Oh, you know her? 

VINCENT	Yeah. 

LARA	She's with me now. 

VINCENT	What? Oh, you're fucking teasing me now. 

LARA	Oh, don't be. 

VINCENT	Oh, fuck you. I'm just dancing. Shit. 

LARA	Can you get us a room? 

VINCENT	We're sold out, but, uh, Magda has a room. 

MAGDA	Uh. 

VINCENT	Come on. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Just a minute. 

VINCENT	Oh, oh. Oh wow, you're a dirty girl, huh. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Hey! Don't! No, no! 

VINCENT	Hey Laura. Your's is bigger, no? 

MAGDA/PAVEL	It's my dad's. 

VINCENT	Your dad's? Oh! Your dad's a little pervert, huh? You should have brought him to the party. Sounds like a real gentleman. 

LARA	And what are you hiding in your closet, Vincent? 

VINCENT	Nothing. 

LARA	Oh, really? 

VINCENT	Come on, so you have a bag of dildos. Come on, have some fun. Fun, fun! Come on. Take some of this. 

LARA	Don't give her K, asshole. 

VINCENT	It's not K. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	I wanna try it. Fuck it. 

VINCENT	That's the spirit. Here. Here. 

VINCENT	Oh, ho, ho. 

LARA	Hey, leave her. She likes girls. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	I want water. 

MAGDA/PAVEL	Please. 

VINCENT	Oh! Fuck, oh! 

VINCENT	Bitch! See, what you made me fucking do. 

LARA	What the fuck? Just get out! 

LARA	You're fucking seventeen? Okay. 

DAVID	Oh my God. 

AUTOMATED VOICE	Warning! Warning! This is a national emergency broadcast. This is not a test. I repeat, this is not a test. All citizens... 

CITIZEN	Hey, you gotta pay for that! 

PANICKED CITIZEN	Give me one! I need to talk to God. 

CITIZEN	It's not genuine, I paint him last night. Good luck with your thoughts and prayers, man. 

WOMAN	Are you okay? Where are your parents? What's your name sweetie? 

EMMA	Emma. 

WOMAN	Let's go sit, okay. 

DAVID	So this is arrogance. They say every end is a new beginning, but that ain't true. People just say that because they wanna feel better. It's easier to live in an illusion than reality. What is this thing called "love" anyway? That you ever get enough of? To anyone? I thought everything made sense but none of this does now. I thought I was in control... 

DAVID	But I'm not. How the hell am I the last man alive? How the hell has that happened? Emma. 

EVA	Recording interrupted. David, you have run out of storage space. Last saved recording. 

DAVID	Whenever you see a star... that would be me just changing a bulb. I love you forever. I love you forever. I love you for

DAVID	I love you too. 

GOD	David, this is God. I know you think I didn't, but I did hear your prayers. I'm sorry, it's been pretty hectic around here. 

GOD	But I'm for you now. My child, how may I help you? 

DAVID	Are you fucking kidding me?
