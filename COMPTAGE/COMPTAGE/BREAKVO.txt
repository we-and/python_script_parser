KAREN			What we wanna know is where we can stay.

OPHELIA	It looks like we’re gonna be roommates.

LISA	Really…

JAMES	We’re free to do what we want, when we want to, with who we want.

OPHELIA	You’re an incredible asshole.

FREDDY	I fuckin’ love college.

KAREN	Is this guy for real?

OPHELIA	Aw, yeah.

JAMES	Who’s your daddy?

BLOND	Brian Talbert.  Why?

LISA	I just want a good education.

JOSE	Whatta ya talkin’ about?

FREDDY	Testing…  Is this thing on?  Oh.  (light laugh)  … Alright.  Scene One.  The Trials (??) of Zorro.  And, action…

BRIDGET	Oh.  Can you believe the heat?

FREDDY	(British accent)  Oh my dear.  It’s only going to get… hotter.

BRIDGET	Mm.  Say that again.  Hot… and wet.

FREDDY	(laughing)

BRIDGET	Jesus Christ, Freddy, we’ve done this scene, like, five hundred times.  Are you able to do this, or not?!

FREDDY	Yes, yes.  We’re gonna do it, okay, just well, we’ll just keep on going…

BRIDGET	God…

FREDDY	We’ll fix it in editing.  Fixing it in editing.

BRIDGET	Yeah.  Fixing it in editing.  And fine…

FREDDY	And where were we?  Where were we?

BRIDGET	Jesus.  Fuck.

FREDDY	Okay.

BRIDGET	Here.  Okay…  Okay.  Okay.

FREDDY	(light laugh)

BRIDGET	Hot… and wet.  (kiss sounds 0 continuous)  (might moaning)

FREDDY	Oh, my secret identity.

BRIDGET	Shh…

BRIDGET	(moaning, oh’s, etc. – continuous)

FREDDY	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

BRIDGET	(moaning)  What the hell, Freddy?

FREDDY	It’s never happened to me before.  I’m sorry, it’s just, ya know, the whole pay load leaving the plane, before it’s off the ground.

BRIDGET	Mm, mm, mm, mm.

FREDDY	The ship leavin’ the dock before the anchor’s polled?

BRIDGET	Yeah, Freddy, why don’t you just say it.  You ejaculated before your penis entered my body.  Jesus Christ, well I guess there’s not gonna be a Take Two, then, huh?

FREDDY	… Sorry.

JAMES	(phone V.O.)  You have reached James’s cell phone.  I’m definitely preoccupied.  Please leave a message at the beep.

OPHELIA	Listen, James, about that, that threesome thing…

GIRL	(moaning, oh god’s, oh fuck it’s, etc. – continuous)

OPHELIA	You’re a free man.  You can do whatever it is that makes you happy…  But, just not with me.

GIRL	(moaning, oh yeah’s, oh god’s, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(‘fuck’ talk, moaning – continuous)

OPHELIA	We’re friends, with all the benefits…  and then some.  (very light laugh)

GIRL	(moaning, oh yeah’s, fuck’s, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

OPHELIA	There has to be limits…  James, call me back…

JAMES	So, can I ask you a question?

GIRL	Huh?

JAMES	Do you, gotta twin?  Mm?  (very light laugh)  A hot friend?  …  Maybe a slightly damaged roommate, who’s open to experimenting?

GIRL	Mm…

OPHELIA	You cock-sucker!

GIRL	(French accent)  Who, me?

OPHELIA	No, him.  I was speaking figuratively.   

GIRL	I see the movie Figurate (??? can’t understand ** maybe a Star Wars movie) Of The Force.  And bang, bang.  You know… ?

LISA	Oh, hey, girl.

JAMES	(voice raised)  Oh.  Wait up!  I can explain.

LISA	She’s in the kitchen.

JAMES	Thank you…  Okay, great.

JAMES	Ah, it wasn’t what it looked like.

OPHELIA	Well, it looked a lot like you getting head, from some bimbo who should know better.

JAMES	Okay, I guess it was what it looked like, but I don’t know why you’re so upset.  I mean, you dumped me.  Remember?

OPHELIA	You’re an incredible asshole.

JAMES	Okay, well, well, I’ll take that as a compliment.

OPHELIA	It isn’t.

JAMES	(breath sound)  …  Baby…

OPHELIA	What?

JAMES	… I got nothing.  Look, okay, okay, okay.  Look, I care about you, okay?  I don’t wanna hurt you.  I love… being fucked, but…  look, bestest friends with benefits?  ‘Kay, please?

OPHELIA	(half crying)  You just don’t get it, do you?

JAMES	We were broken up.  What, what, what’s the fuckin’ big deal?  Ah, hey!

LISA	Ah…

JAMES	Oh, Ophelia!

JAMES	Ophelia!  …  Ah, you don’t have to dress up for me…  I’m not mad at you or anything.

OPHELIA	Oh, believe me, it’s not for you.

JAMES	Oh, oh, oh, yeah, I forgot, that’s right, you like to dress up for yourself, huh?  You still got that sexy little nurses uniform or what?

OPHELIA	Ya know what, James?  You’re not the only one who can mess around.  I’ve got my share of offers, believe me.

JAMES	Oh, really?  Yeah, like who?

OPHELIA	You remember Carl. That really cute freshman?  He asked me out on a date.

JAMES	I think we both know that, that guy’s camper’s in a row of pink tents.  Okay?

OPHELIA	Alright.  Gary.  He gave me his number.

JAMES	Oh, was it three inches?

OPHELIA	Jeb.

JAMES	Oh.  (light laugh)  … Oh.

OPHELIA	(softly)  Oh…

JAMES	Really?  Wow!  (softly)  Wow.  Jeb asked you out, huh?  … My old frat buddy had the balls to ask you out, huh?

OPHELIA	Sure did.  And now, it looks like I’ll be making a move on his balls.

JEB	Let me guess.  You’re feeling guilty about James.

OPHELIA	No.  No, not at all…  Maybe just a bit…  

OPHELIA	I mean, he’s a boy.  He fucks other girls and I put it down to immaturity.

JEB	That sounds about right…

OPHELIA	Aren’t you supposed to be trying to get me to fuck you?

JEB	Sure, but James’s is a hell of a guy.

OPHELIA	Mm.  My body’s ready to fuck you.

JEB	Uh huh.

OPHELIA	But my heart… well…

JEB	Full love for James.  I can see it.

OPHELIA	Well, love is a strong word…  Mm, keep doing that.

JEB	Mm.

OPHELIA	Let’s not talk about James, anymore.

JEB	Okay.

OPHELIA	Don’t talk about anything.

JEB	Talk is over-rated.

OPHELIA	Mm…

JAMES	(frustration sound)

OPHELIA	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	Jeb, huh?  Jeb?  How could you?

OPHELIA	Have you seen that guy?

JAMES	Oh, c’mon.  That’s not the point.  Okay, it’s the, the whole meanness, lack of…  ooh, your…

OPHELIA	Emotions?

JAMES	Yes, ya, um, exactly.

OPHELIA	Oh, so you’re in love with the exchange student? … You guys, did you share a real, deep, spiritual connection?  You know, even though you could only communicate with hand signals?

JAMES	Okay, okay, okay.  Stop tryin’ to change the subject, okay?  I don’t give a fuck about that girl, okay?  The sex didn’t even feel good.  Really.

OPHELIA	Aw, poor you.  What was wrong, she didn’t swallow?

JAMES	Hey!  It didn’t feel good because it wasn’t you, baby…

OPHELIA	I can hate you…

OPHELIA	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, oh yeah’s, etc. – continuous)

LISA	Mm.  Jose.  Mm, just the way I like it.  You’re amazing.

JOSE	So, what’s up?

LISA	I have to find my video camera.  I did an interview with Professor Lasky and it’s airing tonight.  If I don’t find it, then…

JOSE	Ah, I think, I think I saw it in Freddy’s room.  You should look there.

OPHELIA	And stay out, you pig!

JAMES	Hey, guys.  Ooh.  You’re gonna eat that?  Thank you.

LISA	No…

JOSE	What the fuck, dude?  That’s her plate.

JAMES	(mouth full)  Mm.  You’re gonna make someone a hell of a wife, one day…

LISA	(softly)  Bingo.  (breath sound)

OPHELIA	… Sorry.  (sigh sound)  I thought it was the pig…

KAREN	What happened?

OPHELIA	I’m becoming a lesbian.

KAREN	A homicidal lesbian?

OPHELIA	Yeah, sure.  I like the sound of that…  If you’ve got a cock, you’re dead.

KAREN	Mm.  A radical manifesto, but hey, you’ve got my vote.  Sometimes.  It depends on who the cock is attached to and how he uses it and whether…

OPHELIA	You know what, forget it!  Why should I go to jail for that pig?!

KAREN	I assume we’re talking about James?

OPHELIA	… The pig thinks it’s a biological necessity to have a threesome.  He says it doubles the chances of survival for the human race.  It’s his dirty Darwinian theory.  (sigh sounds)  He gave me this, as a present.  Can you believe that?  The day he gave me a picture of himself, god, I shoulda know what an egotistical asshole he is…  Wow.  I feel better.

FREDDY	(sighs)  You let me down, big time.

OPHELIA	What else of his stuff’s in here?

KAREN	There…

OPHELIA	Ha.  You’ll be needing these, pig!

FREDDY	What the…?

OPHELIA	Oh.  And you’ll be needing some condoms.

FREDDY	Oh god.  (laughing)  Ready, Freddy.

KAREN	Hey, take it easy.

OPHELIA	And a little Barry White for your threesome.

KAREN	Oh, wait…  Ophelia, that was your stereo.

OPHELIA	Shit…

KAREN	I know I haven’t been here very long, but…

OPHELIA	I know.  You’re going to tell me that the pig and I are clearly not meant to be together.  I mean, clearly, all we do is make each other unhappy.  We should just break-up and be done.

KAREN	No, actually, just the opposite.  I’ve never seen two people who love each other so much and I’ve had many, many, many boyfriends, but none that I’ve ever cared enough about to fight with, or even be angry with.  If they pissed me off, I always had someone on speed dial.

OPEHLIA	So what am I supposed to do?

KAREN	Well, did you ever think about giving him what he wants?  …

JAMES	I’m condemned to my final meal, right?  … Thank you.

JOSE	So, what happened this time?

JAMES	Chicks.  That’s what happened.  Chicks!  Ya can’t live with them.  Ya just, ya just can’t live with ‘em.  That’s all.

JOSE	Well, you two sounded like you were getting on pretty well.  Yeah.  For seven straight hours.

JAMES	(sigh)  Listen to me, son, listen to me…  Ya know what this is>  … Yeah, take a look.  Yeah, it’s her anniversary gift to me.  (laughs)

JOSE	It’s… lovely.

JAMES	Yeah.  It’s a fucking bear trap is what it is…  Could be useful, though.  Yeah.  Useful…  Useful, still a fuckin’ bear trap.

JOSE	What’re you talkin’ about, man?

JAMES	Listen to me.  Pussy, is nature’s bear trap.  ‘Kay?  We’re out, lookin’ for a quick snack and then SNAP!  We stick in our paw, she’s got ya…

JOSE	That sounds painful.

JAMES	Two words for ya.  Nut cunt.  (Not sure about that, can’t understand)

JOSE	Well, if it’s really that bad, and knowing Ophelia, I highly doubt it,. (clears throat)  you’re doin’ the right thing.  Break up with her, once and for all.

JAMES	Dude, you’re like, you’re like a fucking genius.  Dude, I mean it, like, ah, like a lot, Stephen Hawking, ah, without the motorized wheel chair, but, yeah…  I’m gonna rip my paw, out of that pussy trap.

JAMES	(drunk sounding)  Ya got some explainin’ to do.  Ophelia!

OPHELIA	I’ve been a bad girl.  I think, I need to be punished.

JAMES	(sigh/breath sound)  You’re right…  I’m callin’ the cops.

OPHELIA	Isn’t there anythin’ I can do to get you to drop the charges?  …

JAMES	The law, is the law.  Better men than I wrote the Constitution, okay?

OPHELIA	Mm.  There are no better men than you.

JAMES	(very light laugh)  Oh, god, yeah, that’s the spot.  No!  No!  No!

OPHELIA	Whatta ya want, me to scratch it?

JAMES	No.

OPHELIA	I can if you want me to.

JAMES	No.  Listen to me.  I came here, for one reason, and one reason only.

OPHELIA	I know.

JAMES	You do…  Okay, okay, okay.  Okay, two reasons.  Two reasons…  First… god damn, you’re a sexy bitch.  Just a second.  Jose said, your pussy’s a bear trap and I should bite my own hand off to get away.  Okay?  There, I said it.

OPHELIA	He said what?

JAMES	Look.  The dude is like, fucking Stephen Hawing, okay, only more misogynistic.  

OPHELIA	Well, what did you say?

JAMES	(small clears throat)

OPEHLIA	Ya know what, James, if you wanna get away, you can go, any time.

JAMES	Fuck, you!

OPHELIA	Fuck you and the horse you road in on!

JAMES	(breath sounds)  (whisper)  Oh, god…  Ah…

OPHELIA	This is the last time.	

JAMES	Absolutely…  Ah…

OPHELIA	So, I’ve been doin’ some research.

JAMES	Oh, yeah, I bet you have.

OPHELIA	(very light laugh)  It turns out that, it actually is a biological necessity to have a threesome.

JAMES	Really?

OPHELIA	Mm.  In fact, mountain gorillas in Borneo do it all the time.

JAMES	Was I right?  Or was I right?

OPHELIA	More right than you think.

JAMES	Mm.  Mm.  Whatta ya mean?  … Mm…

BRIDGET	No cameras, right?

JAMES	Um…  Really?  Ah, okay…  Uh…  I, are you sure about the no camera thing?  It, it, it’s…

GIRLS	(moaning, yeah’s, etc. continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, god’s, etc. – continuous)

LISA	What time is it?

KAREN	Lisa, it’s 16 seconds since the last time you asked me.  And you have to invite your entire class?

LISA	This interview’s a big deal, ya know?  This broadcast class is tougher than it looks.

JOSE	Hey, hey.  It’s gonna be alright.

LISA	…  You’re amazing, Jose.  You’re so supportive and understanding…  If only I could find a boyfriend like you…  What time is it? …

KAREN	Freddy!  (laughs)  You look like you just went 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.  (laughs)  Oh…

JOSE	Yeah, you smell like he pissed on you, afterwards.

FREDDY	Man, it’s a conspiracy.  You’re all out to get me.

LISA	We’re not out to get you, Freddy.  We’d never do anything to hurt you.

FREDDY	Oh yeah?  Well, what’re we watching?  Who are all these people, man?

KAREN	This is Lisa’s journalism class and her interview is on TV, tonight.

FREDDY	On TV.  Whoop-tee-doo.  Wow…

KAREN	Shh.  This is important, Freddy.

LISA	It’s on!  It’s on! …  It’s on!

FREDDY	(video voice)  Testing, testing.  Is thing on?  Okay.  Alright…  Yeah.  Alright.  Scene one.  The Trials (??) of Zorro.  And, action!

BRIDGET	(video voice)  Oh.  Can you believe this heat?

FREDDY	Uh, oh…  (ON VIDEO – British voice)  My dear, it’s only going to get hotter…  (reg. voice)  Make it stop!

ALL	No… (etc.)

BRIDGET	(video voice)  Hot…

LISA	This is being broadcast from the main office.

FREDDY	This is being broadcast?

LISA	On campus TV.

FREDDY	(on video)  (laughing)

BRIDGET	(video voice)  Jesus Christ.  Freddy, we’ve done this, like, five hundred times.

ALL	(laughing)

FREDDY	Which way’s the main office?

OPHELIA	A foursome?!  Get the hell out, you pig!

JAMES	Ophelia, what are you doing?  C’mon, I thought we were going to study, tonight.

OPHELIA	I thought you were joking.  Anyway, you can’t study without a little break, right?

JAMES	(very light laugh)  Yeah.  Look, look, okay, look.  I need to pass all of my classes this semester, or else I don’t graduate.  And I’m out.  I’m done.  And… and that means I have to.  I have to pass.

OPHELIA	Don’t say the “D” word.

JAMES	I thought you were mad at me.  Does the word ‘pig’ come to mind?

OPHELIA	Look, I’m bored and I’m horny.  Now, ya gonna let me do this?  …

JAMES	(bite sound)  Oh god.  That, was not feeling good, right there.  Okay…

OPHELIA	I’m gonna get the hang of this, now.

JAMES	Ouch.

BOTH	(very light laugh)

JAMES	Okay, it’s not that I’m not deeply appreciative of your efforts, but…  What the hell are you doing?

OPHELIA	Studying.

JAMES	Oh, studying to, to be a stripper?

OPHELIA	(light laugh)

JAMES	‘Cause, you know, they’ve got exams for that…

OPHELIA	Oh, let me dance for you something.

JAMES	Oh, that’s what that is…

JAMES	Ophelia.  These aren’t all downloads, ya know.  I put out some bucks for some of these…

OPHELIA	I’m…

JAMES	Careful.

OPHELIA	I’m fine, by the way.

JAMES	Oh.  I’m sorry.  That was, that was nothing.  (light laughing)

OPHELIA	I thought it would be easy.

JAMES	Easy?  No, it’s, ah, it’s an art, form.  Have you even been to a strip club?  … No.  Ya know, these, these girls there, they’re… artists.

OPHELIA	You’re right.  I’ve never been.  Maybe I should go.  Bone up.

JAMES	Well, yeah…  Speaking of, boning up…

OPHELIA	(breath sounds, moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	moaning, etc. – continuous)

IN CAR

SUSAN	Jose, please make it stop.  I’ve never been car sick, before.

JOSE	Well, she’s a little temperamental.  (** ??car sound so loud, can’t hear dialog) … 

JOSE 	Sorry, I’m getting a new car…  as soon as I win the lottery.

SUSAN	I have a face, ya know.

JOSE	I’m so sorry.

SUSAN	Don’t just keep apologizing, just, just know that I had a really good time, tonight, and we had a good date.

JOSE	Not comin’ in, huh?  …

SUSAN	Mm…  Jose, I said no…  No tongues.  We have to get to know each other, really know each other.

JOSE	Not that I don’t totally, absolutely, completely agree, but, how long does this process usually take?  Ballpark?

SUSAN	Before I give myself to a man, I have to really, really know him.  And he has to know me…  That’s what makes it so great, that emotional connection.  That’s what sex is all about…  So, talk to you, soon?  You’ll call me?

JOSE	Yeah.  Definitely…

FREDDY	Ah, ah…  Yeah…

BRIDGET	(moaning, etc. – ** continuous throughout scene) 

FREDDY	(light moaning)  Oh!  Oh!  Dude!  That’s just nasty, man.  What?  Now see, if you were bigger than a 10 year old, I’d be missin’ the come shot.  No.  You better go sit over there ‘til it goes down.  Now, you got sit over there ‘til it goes down.  Damn!  Still not getting’ any, huh?

JOSE	Susan needs an emotional connection.

FREDDY	Lesbian.

JOSE	She’s not a lesbian.  She’s a good girl, ya know?  She’s got morals.  Standards.

FREDDY	Lesbian.  I got it.  Okay?  …

JOSE	I really like this girl.  Everything else about her is just great, perfect.  She’s clever, smart, she’s funny.

FREDDY	Uh huh.

JOSE	She’s beautiful.  Way outta your league.  Sexy.  I’m not trashing her…  great walk.  Figure.  Great smile.

FREDDY	Yeah.

JOSE	Perfect girl.

FREDDY	Except she’s from the Isle of Lesbo.  She’s pumping donuts.  She’s a fully certified muff diaper.

JOSE	You don’t know.

FREDDY	So enlighten her to the way of the cock.

KAREN	(moaning, oh god’s, god, etc. – continuous)	… That was an A plus.

JEB	Yeah.

BRIDGET	(moaning, etc. - **continuous throughout scene)

JOSE	Wow.  My balls are the size of a melon.

FREDDY	Thanks for the image.

LISA	Hey.  So, how was your big date?

FREDDY	She gave Jose melon balls.

LISA	Oh, cool, I love melon balls.

FREDDY	Really?  Pop a couple of Jose’s melon balls in your mouth.  Do you both a world of good.

LISA	Melons are actually one of the most nutritious fruits.

FREDDY	Hey, they’re good for facials, too.

JAMES	Ooh.  Alright, kids…  Field trip!

LISA	Where’re we goin?

JAMES	To explore the psychology of human sexuality from the economic and social standpoints.  (very light laugh)

LISA	Mm.  That sounds super interesting.

FREDDY	Sounds like a snooze fest, man.

JOSE	Sounds like a strip club.

JAMES	Bingo!  Prize for my man, Jose.

LISA	Um, I don’t mean to be ungrateful, but, does Ophelia know about this?  I have a feeling she won’t approve.

JOSE	Yeah.

JAMES	Do you think I want to go to one of those houses of debauchery?

LISA	I don’t know.

JAMES	This is for Ophelia, okay?

LISA	Oh.

JAMES	For her thesis.

LISA	Oh!

JAMES	Yes.

JOSE	Isn’t she studying mountain gorillas in Borneo?

JAMES	Have you ever been to the Pink Taco? … Didn’t think so.  Those girls are wild animals.  Trust me…

FREDDY	I’m in.

JAMES	Alright.  All I need is permission slips from your parents.

FREDDY	I’m forgin’ that shit.

JAMES	Alright.  That’ll do.  And 100 bucks in ones.

FREDDY	Done.  (light laugh)

JAMES	Yeah.

JOSE	You don’t have to go.

LISA	Oh, I don’t wanna let Ophelia down.

JOSE	Anything for a friend.

LISA	You never know.  I might learn a thing or two along the way.

JOSE	(very light laugh)

KAREN	Freddy, get out!!

FREDDY	Oh, girl, you know how much I’d pay to see you without a towel?

KAREN	Not enough money on god’s green earth.

FREDDY	50 bucks.

KAREN	Piss off, Freddy.

FREDDY	I’ll go to 100, but you gotta let me take a couple of pixs.  God…

LISA	Get out!

FREDDY	(light laugh)  (softly)  What?

JEB	Take a picture.  It’ll last longer.

FREDDY	What is that freak doing here?

KAREN	Fixing my plumbing.  Now, get out.

FREDDY	Wait a minute.  I come in peace.

KAREN	You come in 10 seconds.

FREDDY	Ya see, that, that’s not fair.

KAREN	Isn’t that what she said?

FREDDY	Hey!,,,  Man…

JEB	You got plumbing needs, you call me when you get one.

KAREN	(softly)  Okay.

FREDDY	And I ain’t no punk.

KAREN	Okay, Freddy, I’ll bite.  Now what is it that’s so important?

FREDDY	Forget it.  It’s nothin’.

KAREN	Aw, c’mon, Freddy.  Please.  For me, tell me.

FREDDY	Maybe for a hundred.

KAREN	Fine…  Here.  Now, what is it?

FREDDY	We’re goin’ on a field trip.

KAREN	Where?

FREDDY	You got change?

JOSE	Great.

JAMES	Alright, pay attention.  There’s gonna be a test, afterwards.

OPHELIA	I’m lookin’ forward to it.

JAMES	Mm, good.

BLOND	How ‘bout a private dance?

FREDDY	Fuck, yeah…

LISA	Wow.

JOSE	She’d really make a great fireman.

FREDDY	Yeah…  You’re so fine.  (light laugh)  …  Ooh, yeah…

BLOND	(moan)  …  Hey!  No touching, lover boy.  

OPHELIA	Excuse me.  From an anthropological standpoint, would you say the naked form is being exploited or exalted?  

GIRL	What?

ANNOUNCER	Let’s here it for Enigma.

KAREN	What kind of name is Enigma?

JOSE	Mom, Dad, I want ya to meet, Enigma.  We’re getting married.

KAREN	(laughs)

LISA	She looks like an Enigma.

JOSE	I gotta go call Susan.

KAREN	What?

LISA	Huh?

KAREN	Looking at Enigma makes you think about calling your girlfriend?  I’ll never understand how a guy’s mind works…

KAREN/LISA	Oh!!

KAREN	Now it makes sense.

SUSAN	(phone V.O.)  Hi, you’ve reached Susan’s phone.  Leave a message and I’ll get back to you.

JOSE	Hey, ah, Susan, it’s me, Jose…

OPHELIA	That’s her?  That’s Susan?  The frigid girlfriend?

KAREN	It’s always the quiet ones.

JOSE	Just wanted you to know that, that I’m cool with waiting.  I wanna wait.  I, I, I think waiting is awesome.  (very light laugh)  …  So, um…  I’ll be waiting…  Ah, I love you.

JAMES	That lucky fucker!

LISA	Whatta we gonna do?  How’s Jose gonna feel?  …  Jose!  I missed you.

JOSE	What?  Ah, I missed you, too.

LISA	(light laugh)  How ‘bout them fighting Eagles?

JOSE	What?

LISA	The fighting Eagles.  (very light laugh)  … Mm, mm, mm…

BLOND	Thanks…  lover boy.

LISA	Mm, mm…  mm.  Okay.  I think it’s time to go.

JOSE	What about my melon balls?

LISA	Oh, I’m sorry.  I’m not that hungry.  C’mon…

OPHELIA	Karen, we gotta go.  C’mon…


JAMES	He got her.  I want her…

OPHELIA	C’mon.  C’mon…

FREDDY	(light moan)  Mm…  Ahh…

KAREN	How did I know I’d find you bound and gagged on the stripper’s floor?

FREDDY	Mm.  How?

KAREN	C’mon.  The other’s are waiting.

FREDDY	No.  I came here for a lap dance.  I ain’t leavin’ ‘til I get full satisfaction.

KAREN	Yeah?  Well, that’s not gonna happen.

FREDDY	100 bucks…

JOSE	Freddy!  Freddy, where you at?

SUSAN	(phone V.O.)  Hey, Jose, it’s me, Susan.

JOSE	Oh, hey…  How’s it goin’?

SUSAN	(phone V.O.)  I got your message and… I cried.

JOSE	I, I’m sorry.

SUSAN	(phone V.O.)  Stop apologizing.  I cried because it was so sensitive and so beautiful.  The wait’s over.  Tonight’s the night, Jose.  I feel it, now.  The connection.  I’m coming over.

JOSE	Okay.  See ya.

JAMES	Hey!  Dude!

SUSAN	I think you’ll find I’m worth the wait.

JOSE	You’re… you’re…

SUSAN	Coming?

JOSE	Enigma?

KAREN	Shit, they left…  I’m gonna need that hundred.

FREDDY	Yeah.  (clears throat)  About that.

JOSE	Why didn’t you tell me?

SUSAN	Great.  Yeah.  That’s a good way to start a relationship.

JOSE	Well, and, and, you think it’s better to start off with a lie?

SUSAN	I didn’t lie.  I just didn’t tell you the whole truth.

JOSE	Why?

SUSAN	I didn’t, because what I do for money isn’t me.  I have rent to pay, bills, tuition and I don’t have a rich family to fall back onto.

JOSE	Neither do I, but I keep my clothes on.  Most of the time.

SUSAN	At work, my relationship with guys lasts as long as the next song.  And with you, I wanted more.  I wanted our relationship to have respect and friendship, maybe love.  Um, not just a quick fumble in a dark room.  I’m gonna go…

JOSE	Don’t…  Please.  I didn’t mean to sound harsh.  I wasn’t judging you.

SUSAN	I know you weren’t, Jose.

JOSE	So, if we, if we do this, see each other… will you continue dancing?

SUSAN	As long as I have bills to pay.  You can handle it?  …

JOSE	I’ve got the biggest melon balls.

SUSAN	I wanna taste that fruit…

SUSAN	(breath sounds, moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	Hi…

OPHELIA	Ah, oh, you better not be thinking what I think you’re thinking.

OPHELIA	Ah…  James, I gotta get this paper done…

JAMES	Yeah, that’s right.  Come here.  (softly)  Put this down…  You don’t say a word.  And only I can touch you.

OPHELIA	(breath sounds, moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

JOSE	If I had dollar bills, I’d be throwin ‘em.

SUSAN	If you had 100 dollar bills, you’d be throwing ‘em.

JOSE	If I did.  Yeah.

SUSAN	(moaning, etc. – continuous)  …  I’m gonna miss this.

JOSE	What?  Why?

SUSAN	Couldn’t tell you before…  not before…

JOSE	Before what?

SUSAN	(sigh)  I’ve been dreading this moment.

JOSE	Susan.  What are you talking about?

SUSAN	Sorry, Jose, but I’m broke, and I have to quit school and hot the pole, full time.

JOSE	No.  C’mon.  But that’s such a waste.  There must be… another…

SUSAN	There is…  I can transfer, home.

JOSE	Okay.  Home is close, right?

SUSAN	Anchorage.  

JOSE	Alaska?  … Do they even have a university in Alaska?  I thought it was all snowy and iglooie and shit.

SUSAN	They have a good school there.  They even have toilets and heat.  And it’s the best I can afford and I can even stay in my parents igloo.

JOSE	But, how ‘bout your strippin’ career?  You can’t just abandon it now.  I mean, you’re reaching your peak.

SUSAN	I want a degree, Jose.  I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in a G string.

JOSE	(sighs)  …

GUY	You should come and hang out at the Airplane Hanger (??)

OPHELIA	With women at the bar?  (???)

GUY	Yeah.  (can’t hear dialog over noise)

JAMES	We party like this all the time.

BLOND	Nice.

JAMES	Yeah, so, ya know, crazy shit happens.  People just randomly show up.  Ya never know.

OPHELIA	(laughing)

JAMES	Are those real?

BLOND	Yeah.  Yeah, they’re real diamonds…

BLOND	Hey!

JAMES	My bad.  Ya know, memory muscle spasm.  I got, I got some shrapnel of metal…

BLOND	Oh, James.  C’mere…

JAMES	You, sex, now.

JAMES	Now listen.  I want to be as loud as possible.  You understand?

BLOND	What’s going on?

OPHELIA	I’m gonna make you scream.

JAMES	Oh, yeah, I’ll take it off, baby.

BLOND	Take it off.

JAMES	Oh, yes, take it off.

BLOND	Oh, yeah…

JAMES	Take it off.

BLOND	Ooh…

JAMES	(moaning, etc.)

OPHELIA	No, really, you have to scream.

BLOND	(moaning, oh yeah’s, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, oh yeah’s, etc. – continuous)

OPHELIA	Oh yeah…  (moaning, etc. – continuous)

BLOND	(ooh’s, yeah’s, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, yeah’s, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	Okay.  Who’s your daddy?  Who’s your daddy?

BLOND	Brian Talbert.  Why?

OPHELIA	I never had a real orgasm, before.

BLOND	(moaning, yeah’s, oh god’s, etc. – continuous)

OPHELIA	(moaning, oh yeah’s, etc.)

OPHELIA	Oh, god, oh god, oh god.  Ahh…

BLOND	Ooh, baby.  Oh yeah.  Oh, it’s so good…  Oh, yeah.  Ooh…

GUY	Oh, baby, oh…  Oh, just like that.  Yes…  Oh…

BLOND	(continuous moaning, etc.)

GUY	Oh yeah, right there.  Aw, shit.

BLOND	Oh, yeah…

OPHELIA	(light laugh)  So, was it as good for you as it was for me?

JAMES	Clearly, I’m better in bed when I’m not actually in bed.

LISA	Hey.  You missed most of the party.

JOSE	I’m not really in the mood.  Susan pretty much dumped me, for geographical reasons…  She’s transferring to Alaska.  Studying penguins or something.

KAREN	Whoo!!  (laughing)  Hey, guys.  Oh.  Jose, what’s wrong?

LISA	His girlfriend dumped him.

KAREN	(hiccup sound)  Drink.  It’s the solution to all of your problems.

JOSE	Ah, I’ve never tried that before…

LISA	I never have, either.

KAREN	Ew.  Enough, already.  I drank so much I can barely feel my legs.

LISA	Nobody’s making you drink it.

KAREN	But you keep saying, I never.

JOSE	So?

KAREN	It’s a game, you guys.  Every time you say ‘I’ve never tried that,’ and I have, I have to take a shot.

LISA	(very light laugh)

JOSE	Mm.

LISA	I never played anything like that, before…

KAREN	Mm.  Okay…  Gather everybody up.  We’re gonna find out some really dirty secrets about everybody.  (laughing)  Okay?  I love games!  Whoo!!  …  There ya go.

FREDDY	Ah, yes.  Dude, Jose.  C’mon, man.  There’s like 15 thousand girls on this campus, man.  Okay, say half of them are already boning some dude, 10% are peppermint patties and that leaves about a shit load to bone.  (light laugh)

KAREN	Oh, and they say that romance is dead.  Great math, though, genius.  Anyway, the game is called ‘I Never.’  Is everyone in?

OPHELIA	I’m in.

KAREN	Okay.

JAMES	Yeah.

KAREN	Okay, so let’s start with something easy.  Lisa, ya wanna start?

LISA	Um, well…  I’ve never had sex.

JAMES	That’s an easy one…

KAREN	Lisa, you’re only supposed to drink it if you have done it.

LISA	Does, oral sex count?

FREDDY	Not according to our former president.

ALL	(light laugh)

OPHELIA	Hold on.  I thought you were saving yourself for Mister Right.  What happened?

LISA	It was an accident.

KAREN	What?  How do you accidentally blow a guy?

LISA	You guys, it was a matter of life or death.  It happened when I had Bible Camp.  It was late and I was ready to go to sleep when Peter came into the tent.

LISA	Hey, Peter…  (V.O.)  It was a boy I knew since kindergarten.  We grew up together.

PETER	So, ah, I, I thought we could, ah, read a few passages before bedtime.

LISA	Okay.	

PETER	It just sounds fine, don’t ya think.

LISA	Of course, Peter.  Whatta ya want to study?

PETER	What, what about the Cardinal Sins?

LISA	Okay.

PETER	Okay…  Oh, oh, one second.  I have to tinkle before we begin.

LISA	Okay…  (V.O.)  We were practically brother and sister.

FREDDY	So you blew your brother.  (laughs)

KAREN	(laughing)  Ew…

PETER	Ooh, ooh, ooh…

LISA	Peter?!

PETER	Ooh… Please don’t…  (crying sounds – continuous)

LISA	What happened?

PETER	(crying)  I got bit by a badger.  Wait.  Quick, ya gotta suck the badger’s poison out.  Please… Please…

LISA	(upset sounding)  What?  How?!  Oh my god!  Okay… (screams)

PETER	(crying sounds)

LISA	Apparently, a badger had bitten him on god’s special organ.

LISA	And I sucked, until all the poison shot out at once.

ALL	(light laughing)

PETER	(light moaning)

OPHELIA	You do know badgers aren’t poisonous.

LISA	Hindsight is 20/20.

FREDDY	I feel so dirty.

JOSE	You’re a hero.

LISA	I saved 14 other boys that night.

FREDDY	Damn, girl.

ALL	(wow’s, okay’s, aw’s, etc.)

KAREN	You’re kidding, right?

LISA	(laughing)  Gotcha, girl.

KAREN	Okay, okay, moving on.  My turn.  Mm, I’ve never had a threesome…

JAMES	My man, Freddy.

FREDDY	(laughs)

KAREN	Ew…  Are you kidding me?  You trying to tell me you just screwed two girls at the same time?

FREDDY	Hey, hey, it was prom night, Susie, Marie and little old me, playin’ lucky Pierre.  Hey, yeah, my dad sprung for a hotel room, ya know.  Told me to dominate the line of scrimmage.  What he really meant, was bone a couple of chicks.

KAREN	Ew…

FREDDY	(very light laugh)

GIRLS	(light laughing)

SUSIE	Oh, it’s so hot in here, isn’t it?

MARIE	C’mon, I’ll help you.

SUSIE	You like what you see?

FREDDY	Ya.  (laughing)  Oh, yeah.

MARIE	Are you ready?

FREDDY	Yeah, think so.

SUSIE	Are you sure?  …

KAREN	Ew…  Alright.  Then, I’ve never had a foursome.  

FREDDY	(laughs)

JAMES	No.  You, you dog!

KAREN	Ah, please, you’re tryin’ to tell me you’ve been with three girls at the same time?

FREDDY	Yeah.  Helen missed the limo, so she had to take a cab.  (light laugh)

HELEN	Hi.,  Sorry I’m late.

FREDDY	Well, we started without you.

HELEN	Just leave some for me…

HELEN	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

KAREN	You slut.

FREDDY	I’m not proud, I mean, well, I kinda am.  (laughing)  Fuck it, I’m proud.  (laughing – continuous)

JAMES	I like that.

JOSE	That’s pretty awesome, man.

KAREN	You’re lying.

FREDDY	Oh, you don’t believe me.  Alright, call up the Jamison Hotel, ask ‘em what happened in Room 508 that night.

KAREN	And you think your sexual conquest was sooo incredible that they’re still gonna remember after all this time.

FREDDY	Oh, they’ll never forget it.  Believe me.  (laughs)

GIRLS	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

KAREN	Okay, well, even if it was true, why would anyone else know in the hotel?

FREDDY	We were on the 5th floor… and, we landed on the 4th.  (laughs)

GIRLS	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

OPHELIA	Holy shit.

FREDDY	(laughing)  Yeah, room 408.

LISA	Was everyone okay?

FREDDY	Ah, a little shaken up, but that didn’t stop us.

JOSE	But, what happened to the people in 408?

FREDDY	That’s when it became a five-some, a six-some…

ALL	(light laugh, wow’s, etc.)

KAREN	Ew, you’re so disgusting.

FREDDY	Hey, hey, hey, we can build on that.

OPHELIA	Well, there’s no topping that story…

KAREN	Ew…

FREDDY	Okay, fine, I made it up.

OPHELIA	All of it?

FREDDY	(laughing)  It was really room 812.

ALL	(laughing)

FREDDY	I’m just fuckin’ with you.

KAREN	Trust me, that will never happen.

FREDDY	Okay.  Wait ‘til I tell you about the 32-some at the swim meet.  It’s a mind-scrambler.

KAREN	(whisper)  Oh…

OPHELIA	I wanna hear from James.

LISA	Yeah.

JAMES	Oh, forget it.

KAREN	C’mon, James.

JAMES	Naw, I got nothin’.

OPHELIA	Oh, sure you do.  C’mon, surprise us.

JAMES	Er, I guess that, I’ve never…  I’ve never been in love…

LISA	(soft clears throat)

OPHELIA	…  I’ve got to, um…

JOSE	Dude, that’s harsh.

FREDDY	Yeah, dude, man, I’m, I’m fucked up and even I know that wasn’t cool, man.

JAMES	Mm…

KAREN	James, what the hell is your problem?  You know you guys are perfect when you’re not fighting.

JAMES	No.  I came this close, this close to falling in love.

JAMES	Honey, I’m home.  (V.O.)  It was a year ago, or something.  Details are kinda fuzzy.  She prepared this whole anniversary thing for us and of course, I started celebrating early.  Big guy…  Come to daddy…  Hey, baby.  Man, you look, you look cold, very cold.  Here, bundle up.  (light laugh)

OPHELIA	(very light laugh)  I got a surprise for you.

JAMES	Wait.  Don’t tell me.  Let me guess.  Darth Vader is your real father.  I called it.  I knew it, ‘cause of your Star War’s theme.  That’s what did it.  That’s what gave it away.

OPHELIA	Close, but no cigar.

JAMES	Okay, let me think…

OPHELIA	I’ll give you a clue.

JAMES	Okay.

OPHELIA	It’s between my legs.

JAMES	No, wait.  Fuck no.  Please tell me you’re not a dude.  Please.  Why does this keep happening to me?

OPHELIA	Will you just look?

JAMES	(sigh sound)  Okay, I’ll look, but if I see ‘wein’ I’m gonna hurl.  Okay?  It’s inevitable…  Oh, yeah…  Oh, what… what is this?  Oh my god, baby.  (names French champagne??)  Blanc de Blanc’s.  I mean, this is, this is priceless.  (V.O.)  That was it.  It was the moment.

JAMES	We gotta have this right now…  Okay.

BOTH	(light laugh)

JAMES	Um… mm… (burps)  Yeah, that’s the stuff.

OPHELIA	(light laughing)

JAMES	Okay, well, I, got a little surprise for you.

OPHELIA	Mm.

JAMES	Let me see, it’s here…  Ah, no, it’s not that.  See this?

OPHELIA	Ah, baby, that’s sweet, but I stopped taking money for sex weeks ago.

JAMES	Joking…  This…  My grandmother’s… She was married 72 years…  She gave it to me on her death bed…  Okay, alright, I’m joking.  She thought I was Lee Majors and I was going to marry her to get her out of the home.  Still, it’s yours, now…  Yeah.  It’s doesn’t fit, I know.  Grandma was quite a half-lump, sausage fingers, but don’t worry, we’ll get it sized to fit you.  Okay, baby?  …

OPHELIA	(breath sounds, moaning, oh god’s, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

KAREN	That was so beautiful.  What went wrong?

JAMES	Mm…  I woke up…  (V.O.)  She’d gone…  Left the ring.  I came this close to falling in love.  Guess I dodged that bullet.	

KAREN	(whisper)  There ya go…

JAMES	Um…  Allergies.  Is there a cat in here or something?  Fuckin’ …  Oh, shit, I gotta meeting scheduled.  I’m gonna be, fucking late, now and great and fucking thing…

LISA	Ophelia.  Are you okay?  …  It’s just, you don’t smoke.

OPHELIA	(very sad)  Thought I’d try something new…  (coughs)  (sniffle sounds)  (coughs)

LISA	You wanna talk about it?

OPHELIA	First Columbus discovers tobacco, 1492…

LISA	James, you want to talk about what happened with James?

OPHELIA	(sniffling)  I came this close, this close to being in love.  And I blew it.

OPHELIA	I had everything planned out.  I was going to tell him how I felt.  I was going to show him how I felt…	(weepy)  And in my heart, just like James always does, he beat me to it.  He pulled out his grandmother’s ring…  (sighs)

LISA	He asked you to marry him?

OPHELIA	He was drunk.  Sounded more like pulling Mary’s teeth.

LISA	What did you say?

OPHELIA	I didn’t.  I panicked.  I grabbed him.  I kissed him, I shagged his brains out.

LISA	You didn’t say ‘yes?’

OPHELIA	(soft weeping)  (sigh)  I’ve known James since he was 16.  I’ve loved him since that very first day…  But he’s still that same kid I met all those years ago.

OPHELIA	And I’m not.  I thought the older we get, the, the more the gap will widen.  I’ll wanna have kids.  He’ll wanna get drunk and party.  I’ll wanna think about retirement plans and he’ll be planning some new line of Co-Ed’s Gone Crazy DVD’s…  So I left	…  I sat there for maybe an hour, maybe a day…

OPHELIA	I don’t know, but eventually, I got to thinking, I don’t care.  I don’t care that he’s a man in a child’s body. (*** maybe that should have been a child in a man’s body) I don’t care that he’s never done the right thing his whole life.  I don’t care that he doesn’t look after himself.  I love him.  I love him because of all those things.

OPHELIA	I went straight back home.  I didn’t want to spend another minute without him…  but it was too late.  I blew it.

LISA	Do you know what happened?  How you were feeling?

OPHELIA	I tried, but…  he wouldn’t even acknowledge that he’d given me the ring.  He said he pawned it for beer money.  (sighs)  (crying)  I never meant to hurt him…  (continuous to cry)
