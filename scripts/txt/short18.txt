THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching..? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Diesel isn't always very kind to the other engines. He likes everyone to think he's rough and tough! Especially his friends 'Arry and Burt.

THE EARL OF SODOR	But underneath, Diesel can be just as much a softie as any of us. Especially when it comes to baby animals.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	What kind of baby animals did Diesel find? Was it ducklings? Was it kittens? Or was it lambs?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Diesel found some fluffy ducklings! Duckling is the name for a baby duck.

THE EARL OF SODOR	And it looks like it's not just Diesel who has a soft spot for these little ducklings!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray! That was fun. Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Today Mike has found a cow in the middle of the track! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Mike doesn't want to keep his passengers waiting. But I don't think this cow wants to move, no matter how hard Mike blows his whistle! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh dear! And now it looks like Mike has lost something!

THE EARL OF SODOR	What did Mike lose? Was it his wheel? Was it his driver? Or was it his whistle cap?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Mike lost his whistle cap.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Never mind, Mike. It looks like your passengers are going to whistle for you!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oohh whoo! That's done the trick. Splendid whistling, everybody!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh, jolly well done for playing! I look forward to seeing you again next time. Goodbye!
