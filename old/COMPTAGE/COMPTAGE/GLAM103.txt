CARMEN	Hi, I'm Carmen. Everything is beautiful and new to me here! I came here to study from a faraway town (inhales) and the only thing I brought with me is Cami...he's my greatest love...(off) no, (exhales) (chuckling) not him! Him!

VAN LINDEN	(off) Very well...now, can anybody tell me the specifics of a sheath dress?

CARMEN	(whispering) Cami!.. Cami!.. (off) Go!.. Get out of here!

VAN LINDEN	Carmen?

CARMEN	(dragging it out) Nnnooo.. (exhales)

CARMEN	(off) I had to do something about Cami. He didn't want to stay in my room.

AMBRA	(screams)

CARMEN	And I couldn't bring him to class either...I had to hide him somewhere.. But where? (whining)Where?

CARMEN	(chuckles) (inhales) No, no, no. Don't tickle me. No, stop it! I beg you. Behave now. Stop it!.. (laughs).. Please help me now, Rebecca.. I don't know where I can possibly hide Cami.

REBECCA	(laughs)

REBECCA	Well, the best hiding place.. (inhales) (off) is in plain sight of everyone.

REBECCA	Cami!

CARMEN	Cami!

CARMEN	Here...these sweets are for you to forgive me!

REBECCA	Oh, but you shouldn't have (inhales) I know he's a glutton! Hey! Watch where you're going with that skateboard!

DAVID	Sorry, Rebecca!.. Catch up with you later!

REBECCA	(sighing) Ah, David...

CARMEN	Yes but look at this mess! (dragging it out)Ah! ..I see you really enjoy donuts...(off) Of Course! I'll turn you into my key-ring mascot! I was raised by my grandma alone so I know how to take care of myself...You need to be clever , that's what she use to tell me all the time!

AMBRA	(gasps) Oh, what a lovely keychain, I want one as cute as this too! Can you make it for me?

CARMEN	So now I'm finishing those keychains for my girlfriends...and Cami is doing some modeling for me! Bye from the High School of Fashion V-Log!
