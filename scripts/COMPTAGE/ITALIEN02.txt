??	"There is nothing emptier than an empty stadium", said the Argentine writer, Eduardo Galeano.

??	According to him, the bleachers and field have a memory.

??	The football chants of the fans, the joyous shouting for a victory, crying for a defeat.

??	Galeano says that the stadiums speak to who listens to them.

??	Go! Go!

??	Go!

??	Don't let him pass, Berna!

??	There's this possibility.

??	Advance there, there or there!

??	The ball must reach the centre-forward.

??	He must do what he did before.

??	Without looking he must know that his companion in behind him.

??	Great! Here he is. Bravo! Bravo, Manuel.

??	Only two days left till the inauguration game of the European Championship between Italy and Turkey.

??	This jersey weighs a bit more than the others.

??	It's as if we're all fans of this team.

??	So you have a greater responsibility.

??	We'll keep on telling you about the trip that brought the national Azzurri team all this way.

??	The sensation, the perception is that something magic is being re-created.

??	For ten months we followed the team along an itinerary made up of many victories.

??	But also of difficult moments, of accidents, selection of the group.

??	What is nice about this team is that everyone can do a good job, everyone can do a bad one, everyone can score a goal.
??	Being a homogenous group means multiplying forces.

??	Under the guide of Roberto Mancini

??	Italy's football has grown.

??	It is once again one of the ten strongest national teams worldwide.

??	Now it can't wait to face the trial and challenge the other great teams of European football.

??	The last three in the middle!

??	I thought he was a good coach.

??	Today I've changed my mind.

??	He is a great coach.

??	I believe it is right to give it all you've got to bring back Italy to the top of the world.

??	Go!

??	We are about to tell you about the Azzurro dream.

??	Every coach knows the time comes when he is alone with himself.

??	It's the moment when he must choose the men that will lead to victory.

??	I have been touring the world for   years, and I know what people think of Italy as a team.

??	I hope that Italy can surprise everyone.

??	Let's hope that Mancini is successful in this enterprise.

??	If he isn't, we must be grateful to him anyway for having tried.

??	Coach?

??	Yes.

??	I made out a good copy of the list that I will re-read, if you agree.

??	So once I have your ok,

??	I'll check with the club and boys and we'll make it official in a couple of hours, if it's ok with you.

??	Perfect.

??	So...

??	Goalkeepers:

??	Cragno, Donnarumma, Meret and Sirigu.

??	Defenders:

??	Acerbi, Biraghi, Bonucci, Chiellini,

??	Di Lorenzo, Emerson,

??	Ferrari, Florenzi, Lazzari,

??	Mancini, Spinazzola and Toloi.

??	Ok, perfect. Thank you.

??	Take a look at it.

??	They should be , but wait for the ok before going.

??	I'm going. We'll catch up.

??	Ok. See you later. Have a good day.

??	On March st the team meets in Coverciano on a beautiful sunny day.

??	The players are busy with a tiresome and committing Italian championship.

??	Some of them are fighting for first place, others to avoid retreating.

??	But as of today, it is only "Azzurro".

??	The European Championship is getting close but another challenge, just as important, must be faced.

??	The first three games of the elimination group for qualification in the World Championship of  in Qatar.

??	Good morning to everyone.

??	I am glad to see you all again after many months.

??	I called in many players.

??	Unfortunately, because of the problems we're aware of, we can't know who comes.

??	There are accidents, COVID, and therefore...

??	I hope to give a chance to everyone to play.

??	It's what I'll try to do in three games, also because we don't have much time to train.

??	Training will be only based on recuperation, and  or  things that for us are fundamental.

??	We must remember that we're starting the qualifications for the World Cup where we can't absolutely afford making mistakes.

??	You know that from experience.

??	One false move and it becomes difficult.

??	We must always have the same mentality against whoever we're playing.

??	This is our mentality.

??	We play to attack and win from the first minute to the th one.

??	Let's hope that they are ten beautiful and important days as usual.

??	My compliments and good luck to all you boys.

??	I greet everyone on the part of the federation.

??	Welcome back to all those who have already been here, and welcome to the newcomers.

??	I follow you on socials and see that many of you are like me.


??	Very impassioned with mantras.

??	So I wanted to begin with a mantra that I like very much.

??	I was thinking of something else.

??	My gosh!

??	"A hundred, thousand kilometre trip begins with a single step."

??	I courted Gianluca Vialli for a long time.

??	Everyone knows. Many know it.

??	He is a young man with extraordinary human qualities.

??	In that historical moment

??	I wanted to give a quality leap even in the relationship with the boys, an important testimony.

??	It seemed like the best way to give even more energy.

??	We've been doing the same thing lately with the addition of another great football player.

??	I am talking about Daniele De Rossi.

??	And therefore, let me introduce the new member of the staff,

??	Daniele De Rossi to whom we give a welcoming applause.

??	Very quickly. You all know him.

??	He is a legend. One of those immortal men who did a lot for this jersey.

??	I think he was a great leader, but is here also to learn with great humility.

??	It's my first day here.

??	I don't know what I can bring but I greatly wish to give a hand.

??	If being useful means putting cones on the ground, carrying jackets and picking up balls, since I am at the beginning of this road, and am in a magic place with professionals who have been doing these jobs at very high levels for twenty years... that is fine.

??	I am not finicky.

??	It's not a problem for me.

??	Daniele De Rossi is a born leader.

??	He brings to Coverciano all his experience of world champion.

??	With the upcoming European Championship he can help the young ones of the team to face the tension on the eve, after having experienced that dramatic

??	World Championship of , marked by the Calciopoli scandal.

??	On March st we played a game in Florence, a friendly match against Germany.

??	There, too, we played a great game because after a half hour we were winning  to . It ended with  to .

??	There was a lot of self-esteem, a great conviction of being strong.

??	Then the mess took place!

??	Football, phone interceptions, the CONI president on the Tg tv news...

??	Even the District Attorney Office of

??	Rome investigates on phone interceptions that make the football world tremble.

??	It is evaluating the contents of phone interceptions...

??	The name of Moggi,

??	Pairetto and Giraudo appear.

??	The scandal exploded in May of , and dealt only with sports executives and referees.

??	No player was involved.

??	But Marcello Lippi's national team that was preparing for the World Cup, was none-the-less hit by controversy.

??	It is irritating to be searched at home.

??	What else must I make clear?

??	The relationship with my son?

??	Italian football is playing two committing matches.

??	There is one on the field and one outside the field.

??	You'll see that this team will not collapse and will do a great performance.

??	Calciopoli was present, so it wasn't easy.

??	Everyone said,

??	"The national team will go to Germany and after  matches will return home.

??	That is for sure."

??	But that's not how it went.

??	I remember that pre-World Championship.

??	I left like a boy going on vacation at summer camp, on vacation with friends for the first time.

??	I was so happy, almost unaware of the responsibility I had along with my companions.

??	Once we got here, the atmosphere was quite heavy.

??	I told myself to keep calm and only think of what I was born to do.

??	Meaning, be a goal-keeper and enjoy these commitments at the most.

??	The rest would work out by itself.

??	I shouldn't waste time with it.

??	It's not easy. You must have the strength to dominate yourself, and it's not easy.

??	I can assure you of that.

??	The greatness of Lippi, and the greatness of the whole team was that it managed to have things go a certain way, by isolating themselves from everything that was happening in Italy.

??	Every July th I send a message to Marcello.

??	I thank him because it doesn't happen often for a journalist to tell about the victory of a World Championship.

??	It is something extraordinary.

??	I found myself deciding for the penalty kick players before Italy-France.

??	I chose the first four and was missing the fifth.

??	I looked around and told Grosso to do it.

??	He said, "Me?"

??	They are those intuitions that come up in certain moments.

??	I told him he was the last second man.

??	He was responsible for the penalty kick with Australia at the th minute, and scored against Germany at the th minute, the th minute...

??	Today you'll have to do the last penalty kick. You are the last second man.

??	So he answered "ok".

??	And it's goal! It's over!

??	Its over!

??	It's over!

??	The sky is azure over Berlin!

??	Lippi's national team silenced everyone by winning the World Championship.

??	The same had happened in .

??	Even that time, Bearzot's national team went to Spain under the weight of a scandal and was a target of the press.

??	An incredible situation involving clandestine football bets.


??	Eleven players, nine in the A League and two in the B League and a president of a club, were arrested at the end of the matches during this Championship day.

??	There are subpoenas for

??	Garlaschelli and Viola of the Lazio team, and Paolo Rossi of the Perugia team.

??	They have to appear on Tuesday at the Rome Judiciary Police Nucleus.

??	Bearzot arrived at the World Championship with part of the press that disliked him. The first press silence in history of a football team, was that of Bearzot's national team, that with a bit of sadism, sent Zoff to talk.

??	Zoff had also been a coach for the national team.

??	I don't mean to take anything away from

??	Dino, but it was tough to get him to speak.

??	The critics were all against Bearzot because he had left at home the top scorer of the last  championships.

??	Meaning Roberto Pruzzo.

??	Bearzot brings his centre-forward.

??	He brings Paolo Rossi.

??	Cabrini is ahead.

??	Rossi! Goal!

??	Rossi!

??	Italy is leading. Rossi!

??	Fifth minute. Italy  Brazil .

??	We were at the sea. I was watching the game with my cousins at my uncle's home.

??	We were all on the ground...

??	There was just one television.

??	I remember that right after the game we went to the little football field.

??	The goal posts were two stones.

??	A big one was the post, the other was the other post.

??	We began to play.

??	I remember everyone wanting to be

??	Paolo Rossi in that game.

??	He had become our idol.

??	Paolo Rossi, top scorer, world champion.

??	What else could you want?

??	I'd say nothing more. A victory like the one tonight was something extraordinary and beautiful. Unrepeatable.

??	An incredible joy for the assertion of these boys, the victory of a truly united group.

??	That team found itself playing against Maradona's Argentina,

??	Zico's Brazil, Socrates...

??	Amazingly strong formations.

??	Only one went through.

??	You had to come in first.

??	That team made it, and won the unrepeatable World Championship because we really defeated everyone.

??	We defeated Argentina,

??	Brazil, Germany...

??	From that point of view it was an extraordinary World Championship.

??	Marco Tardelli told that on the eve of the matches, to charge up, the  team sang a song that was always the same one.

??	Now we'll begin to warm up a bit and then form three teams. Two come over there and we'll do some work.

??	If you feel good, you can easily do it.

??	If you need to recuperate, you'll recuperate calmly and in all tranquillity. Ok?

??	Keep up the good work.

??	We'll begin like this.

??	You will be -like Ireland.

??	Vincenzo will be striker.

??	He'll be on the left side.

??	Manuel, Rafael... Like this...

??	Three mid-fielders and  strikers.

??	Ok?

??	Without looking, change.

??	When the ball reaches Vera or Emerson, the closest player is ready to do one-two, ok?

??	Let's place Marco in this space, too.

??	Lorenzo goes behind a bit, ok?

??	Go!

??	Alright! Alright!

??	Closer, back in your positions.

??	Great!

??	Go, Ciro! On the goalkeeper, Ciro.

??	Go!

??	Excellent!

??	Kick!

??	Ok, boys. Thanks. Alright, alright.

??	Coverciano is a place where the national team is sheltered from everything on the eve of important competitions.

??	They are moments in which one word too many can trigger controversy.

??	Coverciano, a name that on the pages of dailies is repeated periodically.

??	At times we can say with the same frequency as names of countries or of the most important people of the world.

??	Football fans know the reason.

??	Here, in fact, at the feet of the Florentine hills, five years ago a great sports centre was created.

??	Our most famous football champions gather here before an international match.

??	When the national team is playing, everything is amplified.

??	Imagine that when there's the national team, the Italian championship stops.

??	The attention of the fans, of the press, of the media, just as today with socials, is concentrated on only one team.

??	And on only one activity.

??	Therefore,  hours a day we are at the centre of discussion of public opinion.

??	I was told that in the past journalists who came to Coverciano even rummaged in the trash cans looking for notes on formations...

??	Obviously, we must be careful of everything and make sure that all goes well.

??	Because each single episode can become reason for criticism.


??	I am probably not the person best suited to suggest the method in handling relations with the press.

??	I always had reactions of a certain type to stupid questions or attitudes that weren't very serious.

??	And I always had whoever asked a non intelligent question, notice this.

??	Don't put different words in my mouth.

??	Otherwise...

??	You know what I'll do?

??	I won't come speak for  months.

??	You see how you are?

??	You see how you are?

??	You must let us ask a question, too.

??	Don't put words in my mouth that I didn't say!

??	The relation with the press is one of respect because it... Aside from the fact that I know them all by now...

??	They do their best in doing their job.

??	If I can, I try to give them a hand.

??	I therefore hope, that the respect is mutual.

??	Mancini has always been... as a player and as a coach, rather fiery.

??	He said what he had to say.

??	Very intelligent, but from that point of view, not very diplomatic.

??	He began yelling at me until he finally hollered...

??	I am proud of being that if he is a man.

??	But people like him can't be in the football world if they don't ever improve.

??	And yet in the national team a man arrived who fit the role perfectly.

??	Mancini truly measures his words.

??	He even says interesting things and does it always... looking at the sound's decibels.

??	One tone below.

??	It's not that a person changes.

??	Totally. He can improve, but...


??	When a person is younger, maybe he gets upset over everything, and therefore, it isn't even right.

??	This doesn't happen now.

??	To the pressure of the media, there is also the pressure of socials.

??	An arena without rules where players are at the centre of any sort of attention.

??	I have always tried to avoid finding out unpleasant things, or things that were too positive.

??	I have always looked for an equilibrium.

??	Neutral news dealing with me.

??	News that is too exciting or news that is degrading was something I tried to avoid reading.

??	I am a person who pays a lot of attention to this.

??	Because I am also self-critical and hurt my own self enough when I analyse the matches.

??	I won't hide that reading the report cards the following day is a moment of thought.

??	I don't read the report cards in the paper.

??	Our job is...

??	There are many impassioned people...

??	Sometimes we experience difficult moments, but the things they write and judge,

??	I prefer not reading.

??	I only read the things that give me the energy to continue.

??	I've learned to give the right equilibrium to all the voices surrounding me.

??	Because I was taken to the stars when I wasn't ready, and this hurt me.

??	Now I am more aware of what I am without giving too much importance to what they say about me.
??	The relationship of the players of the national team with the press, but in general, of football players with the press, isn't easy.

??	And it gets worse each year.

??	Because now people have socials and can convey their thoughts through socials.

??	Once for having eaten a pizza in Venice in St. Mark's Square they wrote all kinds of things about me.

??	And I was wearing a tuxedo.

??	At first it was tough because every day you were judged for things that people knew nothing about.

??	I like being judged for what I do in the field.

??	In my private life,

??	I'm the one who must be happy.

??	I make my choices,

??	I decide what to do every day.

??	I have people who help me in this.

??	I like it, but I'm not very social.

??	I activated this account in December because there were  fake pages in the name Daniele De Rossi.

??	All pages that spoke in my name.

??	Fortunately, I don't look at socials because I have someone who takes care of them and I don't open them.

??	So much the better!

??	I don't have Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter.

??	I don't have everything that exists now.

??	I honestly couldn't care less of having socials because for me sharing is something different.

??	I once met a person on the street.

??	I remembered the face because he was a person who always came outside the sports centres.

??	He complimented me a lot.

??	A fan, right?

??	Then one day I recognized him on socials.

??	He always wrote bad things about me.

??	Once... I swear. I remember it as if it were now.

??	A clicked on a boy's comment that always said, "I hope you die"... or something of the kind.

??	He was a ten year old boy!
??	He must have been ten or twelve.

??	I swear, not much more.

??	There you understand that two parallel worlds exist.

??	A person is brave behind a keyboard, but when they look into your face and into your eyes they lose their courage.

??	How can a  year old boy ruin my day because he writes "die", "break a leg", "I hope you'll end up in a wheelchair"...

??	I hope that after writing these things you feel better, but as far as I'm concerned,

??	I could care less.

??	In the sense that I am cantered.

??	At Coverciano the Azzurri divide their time between field and lecture all where they study the teams they will face in the elimination group for the World Championship.

??	During our retreats, we watch everything we can concerning the adversaries we will play with.

??	From that, we get ideas, our principles, and develop them on the field.

??	We check some recent results of northern Ireland.

??	It's th in the FIFA Ranking, th in the  European federations.

??	Characteristics of the team.

??	This verticality in searching the forward.

??	This is one of their typical moves.

??	Ball to the forward, bounce off the inside forward, and then develop on the sides where the fifth will come running in.

??	This is what will happen often.

??	Maybe the two strikers are more central in closing...

??	We have the chance of guiding the two right and left defenders.

??	Guiding the ball quickly.

??	Arriving quickly and trying to score a goal.

??	What we said this morning.

??	There will be many situations like this.

??	The fifths are always fairly tight, too.

??	If two of our side men stay on the line, they're almost always free.

??	Andrea.

??	Yes.

??	Listen, since there are beef hamburgers today,

??	I wanted to know how the boys want their meat.

??	The hamburger meat.

??	Three well done, very well done.

??	Yes.

??	Two or three rare, and the rest...

??	Perfect!

??	Very good.

??	Thank you!

??	Perfect.

??	I put very little salt.

??	Good.

??	In two minutes, the others.

??	Medium rare and well done.

??	Thanks.

??	Then give me whole wheat bread for the coach, a little toasted with a drop of oil.

??	Thanks!

??	How should the meat be?

??	Rare.

??	The first day of retreat ends with the usual ritual.

??	The new arrivals must sing.

??	Today there is an exceptional debutant.

??	Hi everyone. I am Daniele De Rossi and I come from Rome.

??	I am  years old... and I'll sing "Lella", a Roman song.

??	Romans, please help me!

??	FROM : A.M. to NOON

??	MD 2 swabs (USUAL PLACE)

??	4:30 P.M. TRAINING

??	12:30P.M. MEETING

??	1:00 P.M. LUNCH. : P.M. LOCKER ROOM

??	4:30 P.M. TRAINING

??	After training want to play a little game?

??	You'll play a game after?

??	After training and tactics, there's the game.

??	Are you playing?

??	Yes.

??	Mancini's boys haven't played together for four months, and the coach has only four days to prepare three very delicate matches from which he will select the  players he'll take to the European Championship.

??	The moment of difficult choices is approaching.

??	As for tomorrow, I will already tell you that we must make a decision.

??	There will be a group of players who will train in the afternoon.

??	Those who are not on the list.

??	A great disappointment, but unfortunately, some tomorrow will train in Collecchio, right?

??	With the others we'll do finishing touches at Tardini. Ok?

??	This is today's program, and tomorrow's.

??	Ok! Shall we play?

??	They begin here.

??	Then they'll back up as Ireland does.

??	Ok?

??	Then when they are here, they begin to come and... play well!

??	We need everyone in construction until we are over there.

??	Ok? Go!

??	Come on!

??	Did you film who did it?

??	Yes!

??	-The photos that were missing to close it.

??	-Thank you.

??	Go!

??	Have a good day.

??	Thanks a million.

??	Is the package in its place?

??	Yes.

??	Packages and flags in the black bag.

??	At Coverciano the lights are turned off.

??	The national team transfers to Parma for the first of the three games for qualification in the World Championship.

??	When we are together...

??	We must always remember among ourselves that it is an honour to wear the Azzurra jersey.

??	And you must do it without ever forgetting who wore it before you.

??	This will allow us to honour at best the memory of.... of players like Anastasi,

??	Pierino Prati, Mariolino Corso,

??	Mauro Bellugi and like Paolo Rossi.

??	I am part of a generation...

??	Many of you are my age.

??	These were important players.

??	I saw them play and they were idols.

??	The fact that they're no longer here it's as if they took away a little piece of me, in particular, Paolo Rossi who for me was an idol first, then a team companion because we did the 

??	World Championship together.

??	Then he was an adventure companion on television.

??	He was a great friend, an older brother, one of the most beautiful people

??	I have ever met.

??	Before the beginning of the game, there will be a memory of former Azzurri players who have passed away in the past few months.

??	The idea was that of remembering these champions.

??	We did it through the section of the Club Italia, the section of Legends.

??	Gabriele Gravina

??	President FIGC

??	Legends represent memory.

??	They were extraordinary men and it's wonderful to show that we cannot forget them. Who doesn't have a memory, doesn't grow.

??	Azzurri forever!

??	Florenzi, here he is! Berardi arrives inside the penalty kick area!

??	Berardi! Italy is in the lead, a great goal by Domenico Berardi, the third one in a row wearing the Azzurri jersey!

??	Florenzi's great kick that this time reaches his companion!

??	Italy counterattacks.

??	Immobile, one against one, accelerates, tries with the left foot, and Immobile scores!

??	The ball surprises on the first post.

??	With his left foot! Immobile!

??	For Leonardo Bonucci, one of the senators of this team, the game with Ireland is the th match on the national team.

??	In front of him, among the players in activity, there are only the Juve companions,

??	Giorgio Chiellini with  times present and Gigi Buffon who leads the ranking with  matches played.

??	Thank you, coach. , darn it!

??	In A League...

??	It's the th with me!

??	Olè!

??	Four minutes late!  less times present!

??	Now you must pay wine for everyone!

??	You'll find the paid fine in the hotel.

??	No, that isn't a fine!

??	The mentality, the courage, the altruism, the determination, the drive and the continuity.

??	The continuity and drive, personally impressed me very much.

??	Nine national championships won with Juve,

??	World and European Championships...

??	Being at such a level for such a long time is a sign of great value.

??	We were talking with Giorgio, that since , we've seen a lot.

??	But every time I come here with great enthusiasm, with the desire to be here with what I believe is the most "team" of all the national teams I've been on.

??	We are at the beginning of a long road, but... with these values, we can get very far. My compliments to everyone.

??	It isn't easy to perform the role of the senators on the national team.

??	It means not only being a guide to the younger players, but also transmitting the values of a team that has a great history behind it.

??	Each person on the staff... the secretary, the doctor, the nutritionist, for every matter that we want to hear the team's opinion, we listen to the senators.

??	Talking to them is talking to the group.

??	My role outside the field is beginning to be a different role.

??	Important in some ways, because there is much talk of the team's rebirth, with many young players, many philosophies, many changes.

??	A young man who arrives on the team has an out-of-the-ordinary enthusiasm.

??	But he doesn't know what he's up against because often this jersey weighs more than the others.

??	Once, during training, there was a player who didn't train as he should have.

??	I didn't make a scene.

??	I approached him and said,

??	"You have two minutes to stop what you are doing and train as you should, or I will grab you by your jersey and drag you outside."

??	Not even the coach intervened. Just a few words and few details were enough.

??	I arrived here when I was  years old.

??	They considered me a little mascot.

??	I always laughed.

??	I sat near Montolivo,

??	Pirlo, Gilardino...

??	I always remained on the right side of the table.

??	Now, instead, they left because they have finished, so I'm on the side of the elders.

??	Another victory arrived with northern Ireland, but Mr. Mancini wanted more goals.

??	There's something else regarding the regulations which I didn't know. I thought that the game results mattered but instead the difference of goals is what matters.

??	We are even with Switzerland, for example. We defeat them twice but they score more goals than us.

??	They pass!

??	You must remember that.

??	So it's one more reason not to stop at the start of the second half.

??	Watch out for this guy turning the ball.

??	I am kidding.

??	Now I'm playing seriously.

??	Icy wind that comes from the mountains.

??	It hasn't snowed in Sofia for  days, but there is snow and ice alongside the field.

??	Bulgaria-Italy begins. Second day of the C Group in the qualification games for the next World Championship in  in Qatar.

??	Insigne, in depth for Belotti...

??	Penalty kick for Italy!

??	A foul damaging Belotti.

??	The penalty kick arrives for the Azzurri.

??	Belotti! Italy is leading!

??	When Spinazzola comes here, leave him one against one.

??	Only for one two, because he'll leave and arrive here.

??	He must put a fast ball here or behind has he did earlier.

??	Ok? You must be patient and have them turn.

??	And we'll score another goal. Ok?

??	Verratti passes Insigne, Verratti waits for Insigne's movement.

??	A heel kick, Insigne stops.

??	Locatelli, there's room for the right!

??	Locatelli's great goal!   for Italy.

??	In Sofia Italy scores another  goals without receiving any.

??	And it takes home the fifth consecutive victory among friendly matches and official games.

??	We must recuperate energy now to face the third game in seven days.

??	You know very well that recuperating is very important.

??	Also in view of the European Championship, it's wiser to activate the muscles with the bike instead of running.

??	I know that many are used to running.

??	Running is a succession of leaps, so every time you run, one leg receives your weight plus the fall.

??	Therefore, in theory, it's an extra weight on the training weight.

??	The second thing we will introduce more and more is posture.


??	What is the best way to lengthen this muscle?

??	Gradually, with your legs on the wall.

??	The muscle, in minutes for each exercise, relaxes.

??	The third very important aspect in recuperating is the work in water.

??	At  I went to Milan.

??	From Viterbo to Milan.

??	What was the impact like?

??	The first months were tough, because I didn't play.

??	Was there ever a moment when you said,

??	"Why did I get into this?"

??	You could've stayed close to home, or was there the dream...

??	No. My objective was there, even in difficulty.

??	Even when they said to me,

??	"You won't get anywhere", "you won't play, you won't"...

??	I put everything aside and left.

??	Answer these two questions.

??	After a difficult game, when do you feel more tired?

??	Two days later.

??	Ok.

??	Without a doubt.

??	When do you feel tired?

??	One or two days later?

??	Two days later.

??	Second question.

??	How much does the trip influence you?

??	Very much.

??	The time in which we recuperate the most is from  a.m. to  p.m.

??	It's the best time for the body's bio-rhythm.

??	We try to adapt recuperation on the basis of this data.

??	Up until now you are all tired after  hours.

??	The perception is that the following day you do less and do more the next one.

??	But I want to adapt it to your real needs.

??	When I play away from home, the following day I'm devastated.

??	The rd and last game of the group will be played at Vilnius against Lithuania in a small, windy stadium, with a synthetic grass field on which the ball bounces quickly and it's difficult to control it.

??	Mancini lines up many young boys and another debutant of his management, the Italo-Brazilian Tolòi.

??	Ball in the middle, Locatelli.

??	Sensi's support arrives.

??	Ball on the left foot... Sensi!

??	Italy is in the lead!

??	Sensi brings the Azzurri ahead of Lithuania! Fundamental goal to unblock a game that seemed complicated.

??	Italy suffers, makes many mistakes, but wins again.

??	Our goleador, Ciro Immobile, is the game man, in the good and bad.

??	He makes many mistakes but scores a penalty kick goal at the last minute.

??	Immobile scores! for Italy!

??	We had said it. There is time for Ciro

??	Immobile to make amends for the mistakes and he does so the last instant with the penalty kick.

??	Instead of celebrating he leaves cursing at himself.

??	That gesture portrays the spirit of the team that Mancini formed.

??	A group that is never satisfied.

??	It wants to win, play and have fun.

??	After the game with Lithuania, the players return to their own clubs until the end of the championship.

??	And Mancini is alone with his thoughts.

??	The moment for choosing has come for him.

??	From September until today, he called over  players, giving everyone the opportunity and a hope.

??	But now his assignment is that of selecting the  who will participate in the great
??	European adventure.

??	Mancini knows that it won't be easy to decide, but he must do it.

??	And must do it in solitude.

??	IN THE NEXT EPISODE

??	The game with Lithuania closes an extraordinary cycle for Mancini's Italy.

??	We are a strong team with a strong will, and we have a coach who gave us great self-confidence.  games in a row without ever losing.  goals scored and only  received.

??	Undefeated goalkeepers in  consecutive games away from home.

??	It is our duty to try until the end.

??	They are just numbers, good for statistics, but they tell us that Italy can play on the same level as everyone.

??	We have come to a point in which we can face any selection.

??	France, Germany, Spain, England and the other great teams of Europe are waiting for us.

??	We're almost there.
