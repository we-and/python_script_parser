(MY BOSS’ WEDDING)


PREACHER	Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the coming together of Anne and Jeffrey.
NICOLE	Sorry. Miss Price?
KIM 	Hey, Nicole, sorry to bother you on the weekend.
NICOLE 	No problem.
KIM 	I was wondering if you could come in early Monday. I want to go over the Metro Media file.
NICOLE 	I would love to! I have some great ideas I've been thinking--
KIM 	Why are you breathing so heavily?
NICOLE 	It's just, ah... Jogging.
KIM 	I don't know how you find the time.
NICOLE 	I have some great ideas on the Metro Media file. I would love to tell you.
KIM 	Wait... Why are you whispering?
NICOLE 	There's a wedding going on in the park right now and I'm pretty sure they're about to get to that part where they ask, "Speak now, or forever hold your peace."
KIM 	A wedding in a park? Oh! How romantic.
NICOLE 	Sure.
KIM 	Come on. It must be beautiful.
NICOLE  	It's, uh, cute. Let me get somewhere I can talk. I really, really, really want to tell you about-- I! Am! So! Sorry!
KIM 	Nicole, is everything okay?
NICOLE  	Miss Price, I gotta run. Congratulations.
PREACHER	I don't think that counts.
NICOLE 	Good morning! Oh, I can't talk. There's work to be done.
MAGGIE	But it's the weekend.
NICOLE	Mm Good morning.
MONICA	Good morning.
NICOLE	Here it is!
MONICA	Here's what?
NICOLE 	The file that is going to get me the junior-executive promotion.
MONICA	You always say that. You've been trying to get noticed ever since you started here. What's so special about it this time?
NICOLE	Well, Kim called me over the weekend wanting me to come in early this morning to give her my ideas for Metro Media. She's trying to land their contract and, uh, she has a big meeting with them -- today!
MONICA	Okay...
NICOLE	Well, I worked on it all weekend and here it is, so... what do you think?
MONICA	I think it's thick.
NICOLE	Well, yeah. I wanted to be thorough. I mean, this is a really important contract, so I figured if I just--
MONICA	Did Kim ask you to do... all that?
NICOLE	(scoffs) Well, no. But I took initiative!
MONICA	Initiative?
NICOLE	Yeah-huh.
MONICA	You want to know what another saying for initiative is? Jumping to conclusions. Take my advice: don't do anything unless someone tells you to.
NICOLE	(scoffs)
MONICA	Even then, wait 'til they ask a second time. For men, it's three. Trust me. You'll be happier. There's Kim now. Good luck!
NICOLE	Okay.
KIM	Morning, everyone.
NICOLE	Good morning, Miss Price.
KIM	No, Nicole, it is not a good morning. It is a great morning.
NICOLE	Ooh! You seem happy.
KIM	After the weekend I've had...
NICOLE	Well, while I have you here, I wanted to talk to you about--
KIM	Do you know that stage of love when everything is just so... amazing?
NICOLE	Sure.
KIM	You feel like you're just floating across the floor.
NICOLE	Yeah. It's, ah... magical.
KIM	It is magical.
NICOLE	Yes, I agree but I wanted talk to you...
KIM	Oh, you can take that fake smile off your face.
NICOLE	(scoffs) Fake smile?
KIM	Nicole, I have no idea why somebody so young and so beautiful can be so... Bah, humbug! about everything romance.
NICOLE	(laughs)
KIM	So... the schedule?
NICOLE	Yeah. (clears throat) You have your lunch with Metro Media today and I have some ideas for the pitch that I--
KIM	You can cancel that meeting. I landed the contract.
NICOLE	Uh... You landed it?
KIM	Yeah. I mean, yesterday, after our call, I decided why not just take the executives out to dinner?
NICOLE	And?
KIM	And somewhere between the wine and the karaoke, I signed them to a three-year deal.
NICOLE	Wow... Congratulations!
KIM	Thank you. So, all of this, much appreciated but not really needed.
NICOLE	Oh! I just wanted to show you what I could do if I was given the opportunity.
KIM	Aw, Nicole. I mean, being a workaholic is so early 2000s. Trust me -- I was there. Nowadays, it's all about relationships and... team spirit.
NICOLE	Huh. Well, I'm not a workaholic. I'm just highly organized.
KIM	Well, when was the last time you organized your way into a romantic rendezvous?
NICOLE	Huh.
MONICA	Soooo?
NICOLE	Don't! Just... Don't. (sighs)
MICHAEL	One of a kind I see you smile and I'm all right You ease my mind Long as you're near me I'll be fine Instead my chest about to burst It's what you do to me One thing I'm sure--
NICOLE	Excuse me?
MICHAEL	For you there are no words...
NICOLE	Excuse me?
MICHAEL	Yes? Pretty girl reading the book.
NICOLE	Thank you. Hi.
MICHAEL	Do you have a request?
NICOLE	No. Well... Yes, actually...
MICHAEL	What do you want to hear?
NICOLE	(sighs) This is the second time you've played that song. Is there something else you can play? Anything else?
MICHAEL	I think I was doing a pretty good job at it.
NICOLE	No, you are. That's the problem.
LADY	I like that song.
MICHAEL	Thank you.
NICOLE	I have 22 minutes left on my lunch break. Is there another song you could play?
MICHAEL	I can-I can play you something else.
LADY	What's wrong with that song?
NICOLE	It was mine and my boyfriend's song, but we broke up, okay?
MICHAEL	Aw. You recently broke up with your boyfriend. I'm sorry.
NICOLE	Well, it-- It wasn't that recent, actually.
LADY	How long?
NICOLE	(smacks lips) Like a year ago.
LADY	What?
MICHAEL	Yeah, sorry. I couldn't hear you, either.
NICOLE	We broke up a little over a year ago, okay?
LADY	Lady, get over it.
NICOLE	(sighs) You know what?
MICHAEL	Oh! Okay.
NICOLE	Problem solved. (sighs) Knock yourself out.
MICHAEL	This is dedicated to you.
MICHAEL	You're one of a kind I see you smile and I'm all right You ease my mind As long as you're near me I'll be fine Instead my chest about to burst
NICOLE	Hey!
MAGGIE	Hey. There's left-over pizza if you want.
NICOLE	Ooh! You look nice.
MAGGIE	Thanks. I got a date.
NICOLE	Ooh. With who?
MAGGIE	Mark.
NICOLE	Mm. The guy with the nose ring?
MAGGIE	Don't judge! He's nice.
NICOLE	Sure.
MAGGIE	Okay, on the rare occasions you go on a date, I don't judge.
NICOLE	A: me going out on a date is not as rare as people make it out to be.
MAGGIE	Yes, it is.
NICOLE	And B... Okay, there is no B. You're right. I shouldn't judge.
MAGGIE	Do you want me to see if maybe he has a friend he can bring? Double date?
NICOLE	(scoffs; laughs) No. Look at me, I got pizza. I'm good. I'm good. What's going on? Hey! What's going on?
MONICA	Kim has an announcement.
NICOLE	Do you think it's about the promotion?
MONICA	Don't know. Could be. You got here just in time.
NICOLE	(exhales loudly)
KIM	Everybody... I have a big announcement. You have all met my boyfriend, Bradley. Well, Bradley is not my boyfriend anymore.
NICOLE	What?
KIM	He's my fiancé! (laughs)
NICOLE	Oh! Congratulations! Everybody! Whoo!
KIM	Thank you! Okay, everybody, back to work.
NICOLE	(sighs)
KIM	Oh, ah, Nicole?
NICOLE	Yeah?
KIM	Can Bradley and I have a moment of your time?
NICOLE	Yeah, yeah. Oh! Sorry. My goodness. (laughs) It's a safety hazard. I'm going to put a sign up later or maybe I'll just get rid of it altogether. Sorry about that! Wow! Congratulations, you guys. This is really... exciting!
NICOLE	Thank you, Nicole.
BRADLEY	Thank you. You know Bradley and I have busy schedules.
KIM	Whoo! Don't I know it. And because of those schedules and some upcoming travel in the next couple of months, we need to pull off this wedding fast.
NICOLE	How fast?
KIM & BRADLEY	Two weeks.
NICOLE	Yikes! Well, that sure is fast. (chuckles) I'll be sure to respond to my invite A-S-A-P. (laughs)
KIM	Um...
NICOLE	Oh! My gosh. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to assume that I was invited, I was just... trying to be funny and... Oh, gosh.
KIM	Oh, no! Of course you're invited.
NICOLE	Yeah?
BRADLEY	Actually, you're more than invited.
NICOLE	More?
BRADLEY	More.
KIM	What my fiancé is trying to say is that we're going to need some help planning this wedding if we're going to pull it off on time. And you are the most organized person I've ever worked with.
BRADLEY	(sucks teeth)
KIM	So... we were hoping that you would be... our wedding planner.
NICOLE	Oh!
BRADLEY	Listen, Kimmy tells me you're not the biggest fan of romance.
NICOLE	Everybody keeps saying that! (clearing throat) But I like romance. I do. Romance just doesn't seem to like me very much. (chuckles)
BRADLEY	Well, that's why I've asked my nephew to help out.
NICOLE	I work better alone.
BRADLEY	Think of him as your assistant?
NICOLE	Mm. I still work better alone.
KIM	Oh, but I've met Bradley's nephew several times. Really sweet kid. Hopeless romantic.
BRADLEY	Everybody in the family calls him Mr. Romance.
NICOLE	Okay...
BRADLEY	I shouldn't be saying this, but, uh, he's my favourite nephew.
NICOLE	Ah! Ooh!
BRADLEY	(laughs) He's a bit of a black sheep in a family, uh, full of type-A businesspeople. But he's super sweet.
KIM	And easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean.
BRADLEY	Runs in the family.
KIM	Oh!
BRADLEY	(chuckles)
NICOLE	Ohhh. Oh! I have so much work to do, maybe... your nephew could handle this on his own?
BRADLEY	(sucks in breath) Michael? Sweet kid, just not the most reliable, if you know what I mean?
NICOLE	Oh.
KIM	We were thinking that the two of you would make a great team. Yup, he'll bring the romance and you can bring the focus and organization.
NICOLE	Mm.
BRADLEY	Kind of give this wedding planning the old one-two punch.
NICOLE	Uh! (laughter; gasp) I think this is a horrible idea.
BRADLEY	What?
KIM	Nicole! I mean, you know I love your unbridled honesty, but I was hoping that you'd be a little bit more...
NICOLE	I'm kidding!
BRADLEY	Gahhhh!
NICOLE	Oh!
KIM	(laughs)
NICOLE	I would love to plan your wedding!
BRADLEY	See? I told you she'd say yes.
KIM	Ah, perfect! Bradley has organized for you two to meet this morning.
BRADLEY	Should be here any minute.
NICOLE	This morning?
KIM	Nicole, you have to plan a wedding in two weeks. You have no time to waste.
NICOLE	Of course. What in the world?
BRADLEY	There he is now.
NICOLE	That's your nephew?
BRADLEY	Yeah.
KIM	Didn't I tell you he's easy on the eyes.
BRADLEY	Michael! Come on over here. Hey! You brought dogs!
MICHAEL	Hey, Uncle Brad!
BRADLEY	Hi!
MICHAEL	Kim.
KIM	Michael, this is Nicole. The woman I was telling you about.
MICHAEL	You're the woman from the park.
NICOLE	And you have dogs. Lots of dogs.
MICHAEL	I have a dog-walking business.
NICOLE	Oh!
MICHAEL	Wait, you're not allergic, are you?
NICOLE	No. No, no. I'm just not the biggest fan of dogs. Ooh.
KIM	Do you two know each other?
NICOLE	No.
MICHAEL	Yeah.
NICOLE	(chuckles) We met in the park yesterday. He was playing the guitar and…
KIM	Hm.
BRADLEY	Huh.
NICOLE	This is going to be a lot of fun.
MICHAEL	Why don't we take 'em for a walk? It'll distract 'em. Come on, guys.
NICOLE	Now? I... (gasps) I have a lot of work to do.
KIM	Oh! Go for a walk. It'll give you guys a chance to get to know each other. And, Nicole, Bradley and I want this wedding to be-- fabulous!
NICOLE	I'll get right on that, Ms. Price.
KIM	Please... Call me Kim.
NICOLE	Okay... Kim.
BRADLEY	Thanks, Nicole.
NICOLE	Oh!
BRADLEY	What?
NICOLE	Going to get a sign for that. Ohh.
MICHAEL	You all right there?
NICOLE	Hey, cuties!
MICHAEL	Let's do it. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. She's good. She's good.
BRADLEY	(sigh)
MICHAEL	So you don't like dogs?
NICOLE	Uh, it's kind of a long story and we have a ton of work to do.
MICHAEL	Yeah, we're planning a wedding.
NICOLE	Yes, it's all very exciting.
MICHAEL	I know, right?
NICOLE	I was being sarcastic.
MICHAEL	You know, Kim and Bradley warned me about you.
NICOLE	Warned you? What did they say?
MICHAEL	I'd rather not say.
NICOLE	Well, I'd rather not be walking half a dozen dogs and planning my boss's wedding, so...
MICHAEL	They said you might be a little apprehensive.
NICOLE	Oh! Well, that's true.
MICHAEL	All right, what have you got here? Hey! How to plan a wedding in ten easy steps. Step one, schedule, schedule, schedule.
NICOLE	See? Now that is really great advice.
MICHAEL	I bet you think so! Kim and Bradley told me about you and your schedules.
NICOLE	Well, that's why they asked me to help organize their wedding.
MICHAEL	And the fact that you're reading articles like this is why they asked me to help. We're going to make an amazing team.
NICOLE	Amazing. Yeah... That's the first word that popped into my head. (giggles)
MICHAEL	So, sarcasm is your default?
NICOLE	(sighs) Sorry. It's just... I have so much work to do and there's this promotion coming up that I really, really, really want.
MICHAEL	A-ha! There it is.
NICOLE	What?
MICHAEL	Kim is your boss, so if you do a great job at her wedding, it'll go a long way in having her in your corner come promotion time. Am I right?
NICOLE	(sighs)
MICHAEL	Thought so. Okay, so you handle the scheduling and planning. I'll take care of the romance, okay?
NICOLE	You know, that's what Kim and Bradley said. They called it... "the old one-two punch."
MICHAEL	(laughs) What was all of that?
NICOLE	Uh, punches.
MICHAEL	Uh-huh.
NICOLE	You know, the old one-two punch.
MICHAEL	You've never thrown a punch before, have you?
NICOLE	(laughs) I've never had to.
MICHAEL	Okay. Well, uh, leave the romance -- and the punching to me. Teamwork. Come on. Come on, Lona. Come on, Lona. Come on. Come on, guys.
NICOLE	Teamwork. So, we're walking these dogs and then he's all, like, "So I guess sarcasm is your baseline"?
MONICA	So, he's a fast judge of character is what you're saying.
NICOLE	Ha-ha-ha. But don't you think you should know someone better before you say something like that?
MONICA	Once he gets to know you, he'll love you, just like we all do.
NICOLE	(laughs) Great. O-M-G! Look at this dress. Uh... it's a beautiful dress.
MONICA	I love wedding magazines. So, what's the next steps?
NICOLE	Um, we're going to go check some wedding venues tomorrow.
MONICA	You're so lucky.
KIM	Back from the walk so soon?
NICOLE	Yeah. Uh, Michael had to get the dogs back.
KIM	Isn't he great?
NICOLE	Sure is!
MONICA	That's what Nicole was saying.
KIM	Really? 'Cause usually when Nicole says something nice about a guy, she's being sarcastic.
NICOLE	Ha!
KIM	What's wrong with my soon-to-be nephew? Does he prefer Google Docs over Excel?
NICOLE	(laughs) Um, no. We're just two very different people, but I think we'll make a good team.
KIM	I'm sure you will. And didn't I tell you? He's easy on the eyes. Oh. Those flowers? Hideous.
NICOLE	(gasps) Burn it.
MAGGIE	Hey.
NICOLE	Hey. Good morning.
MAGGIE	These dresses are gorgeous! You're so lucky.
NICOLE	(sighs) That's what people keep telling me.
MAGGIE	Oh, come on. Even you can't find a way to hate this.
NICOLE	And, yet, I have found so many ways. You should see this guy, Michael. He's playing guitar one day and walking dogs the next. I mean, (laughs) who lives like that?
MAGGIE	So why did you say yes?
NICOLE	Because I had no choice. Rule number one -- you never say no to your boss. Especially when you want a promotion.
MAGGIE	Well, it's better than sitting in an office all day.
NICOLE	What? Checking out wedding venues with some cute guy. (inhales)
MAGGIE	Wait, this Michael guy is cute? You never mentioned that before. Hm. I see what's going on here.
NICOLE	What?
MAGGIE	Maybe you like him?
NICOLE	Like him? I barely know him and what I do know is more annoying than anything else.
MAGGIE	Okay. You go hang out with the cute boy all day and act annoyed by it.
NICOLE	Trust me! I would take my schedules and my spreadsheets any day.
MAGGIE	Look at this photo! These two are so in love.
NICOLE	Those are two models who are paid to look that way.
MAGGIE	Well, these two are definitely in love.
JANETTE	(laughs) Michael! You are so funny!
MICHAEL	(laughs)
JANETTE	Are you a comedian?
MICHAEL	Uh, no. Um... I'm a musician.
JANETTE	Oh, that's pretty good, too.
MICHAEL	Some of my music is funny. Unintentionally.
JANETTE	Oh! Funny guy.
NICOLE	Hey!
MICHAEL	Hey! Uh, Janette, this is Nicole, the woman I told you about.
JANETTE	I'm Janette, the assistant wedding coordinator.
NICOLE	Nice to meet you.
JANETTE	Mm-hm. Let's get started, shall we? Follow me.
NICOLE	She seems, uh... friendly.
MICHAEL	She was super nice until you got here.
NICOLE	I noticed that. Did you say something about me to her?
MICHAEL	Nothing bad.
NICOLE	What did you tell her.
MICHAEL	That you were a smart, funny executive with a bright future ahead of you.
NICOLE	Huh. What did you really tell her?
MICHAEL	That you're an over-organized, anti-romance wedding hater.
NICOLE	Oh! I am not an over-organized, anti-romance...
MICHAEL	Wedding hater.
NICOLE	Well, over-organized, okay. But I take that as a compliment. I most certainly am not anti-romance, nor do I hate weddings. (laughs)
JANETTE	Sorry about that. The Davidsons? They are getting married here in a few weeks. Such a cute couple.
MICHAEL	So cute.
JANETTE	Ah.
NICOLE	Blah.
JANETTE	Pardon?
NICOLE	I said, "Yeah. Super cute!"
JANETTE	Moving along.
MICHAEL	Hey, I'm trying to get Janette on our side. Getting a venue like this on such short notice is a big ask.
NICOLE	I know. I'm sorry! I just... Just do your thing.
MICHAEL	Okay. Oh, Janette! Um, this place looks very familiar. Was it featured in Wedding Quarterly's Top Ten Venues List?
JANETTE	Yes! Oh, my gosh. I am so impressed that you noticed. Isn't he amazing?
NICOLE	Very amazing.
JANETTE	You are a very lucky girl.
MICHAEL	No, we're not--
NICOLE	Oh, you-- No, we're not together.
JANETTE	Sorry, I just assumed she was your girlfriend.
MICHAEL	Nope. No girlfriend.
JANETTE	Single? Interesting. Hm. Me too. (chuckles)
MICHAEL	Huh.
NICOLE	Ah, um, Janette would you mind showing us where we'll be having the reception?
JANETTE	Sure. Follow me.
NICOLE	Ah...
JANETTE	And the D-J booth usually goes up right there, leaving seating for up to 100 people.
NICOLE	Hm.
MICHAEL	This is stunning, Janette.
NICOLE	Oh, yes. It's very... romantic, Janette.
JANETTE	I actually have another showing but I will leave you guys some information. It has the pricing and everything else you could need.
MICHAEL	Great. Thank you.
JANETTE	And Michael?
MICHAEL	Yes?
JANETTE	This is my cell number... Just in case.
MICHAEL	(chuckles)
NICOLE	Just in case... what?
MICHAEL	I don't know. Ah, pretty girls just give me their numbers sometimes. I have no idea why.
NICOLE	(laughs) Maybe I should hang on to it, you know? If anybody's going to call with questions, it'll probably be me.
MICHAEL	I have a surprise for you.
NICOLE	Ooh! I guess nobody told you?
MICHAEL	Told me what?
NICOLE	I hate surprises.
MICHAEL	I have a theory that people who say they hate surprises actually really love them.
NICOLE	Nope. I hate surprises. It's on my list, along with, "going with the flow", "trusting in the universe" and overall general spontaneity.
MICHAEL	Okay. Do you, at least, like sandwiches?
NICOLE	Huh?
MICHAEL	All right. Don't hate me.
NICOLE	Oh, I don't like the sound of this.
MICHAEL	I may have just switched your schedule around a little bit.
NICOLE	You did what?
MICHAEL	There is this, ah, place around the corner that makes the most amazing sandwiches.
NICOLE	And?
MICHAEL	And I called the other venues that we're going to see today, and I just moved things around a little bit so that we would have time to grab some lunch.
NICOLE	You changed "my" schedule?
MICHAEL	It's going to be worth it. Trust me.
NICOLE	Mm-mm. This is a really Good sandwich.
MICHAEL	My dad always said the way to a woman's heart was through her stomach.
NICOLE	You could take Janette here on your first date.
MICHAEL	Yeah. I don't think that's going to happen.
NICOLE	She not your type?
MICHAEL	This might sound cliché, but I may be getting back together with my ex, Julie.
NICOLE	Why?
MICHAEL	She reached out. We started talking. Obviously, there were problems with the relationship, but it was also really amazing sometimes, too. And love is always worth fighting for. Also something my dad taught me.
NICOLE	Sounds like you're pretty close to your family.
MICHAEL	So, the other day, when we met, and I was playing that song...
NICOLE	Did I overreact?
MICHAEL	No, no. I-I get it. That song reminded you of a bad break-up.
NICOLE	I should've just put in my headphones.
MICHAEL	If you had requested something, what would it have been? I'm curious. Like, what kind of music do you listen to?
NICOLE	Really obscure stuff. Honestly.
MICHAEL	Like?
NICOLE	Well, a few years ago, I got really into this band out of Portland called Roadside Rescue.
MICHAEL	Hm.
NICOLE	I haven't listened to them, you know, in a few years. So, how do you get roped into planning your uncle's wedding?
MICHAEL	Why are you changing the subject? You don't want people to know too much about Nicole Waters?
NICOLE	Seriously, you must have other things to do? Work?
MICHAEL	I am taking a little break from work right now. I'm just playing the odd gig, walking dogs here and there.
NICOLE	And?
MICHAEL	And Bradley is the only uncle that I really like.
NICOLE	Oh. He said you were a bit of a black sheep in the family?
MICHAEL	Bradley's always been there for me. So, I want to make sure that this is really special for him and Kim.
NICOLE	Hm.
MICHAEL	Plus, I want to make a good impression on Kim. I mean, she's going to be family now.
NICOLE	(laughs)
MICHAEL	And I thought this would be really fun.
NICOLE	Fun? Planning a wedding is never fun.
MICHAEL	No, planning your own wedding is never fun.
NICOLE	Why do you know so much about wedding planning?
MICHAEL	Four sisters, no brothers, all married.
NICOLE	Oh. Um... Please.
MICHAEL	There's lots. (laughing) We could-- Here. I'll take this one.
NICOLE	(laughs)
MICHAEL	Uh, so how did you get roped into planning a wedding? For your boss?
NICOLE	Your soon-to-be aunt is great. Honestly. But I've been working for her for a while now and we just haven't found a way to...
MICHAEL	Gel?
NICOLE	Yes! Gel. Exactly.
MICHAEL	So you think planning her wedding might help?
NICOLE	Well, for the first time ever she insisted I call her Kim. So, I guess that's a start?
MICHAEL	I've only known you a small amount of time, but.. it's pretty obvious that you're a smart, focused woman who probably has good ideas. So, you'll be fine.
NICOLE	Thanks.
MICHAEL	You just need to learn how to go with the flow. You know? Trust the universe.
NICOLE	(laughs) Ha, ha, ha.
MICHAEL	We should probably get going. Ah, there might be traffic and I would hate for us to be late.
NICOLE	Look at you! Making time for traffic, planning out schedules. Maybe I'm rubbing off on you. Oh!
MICHAEL	Why don't you grab that and I will go take care of the bill.
NICOLE	Hello?
KIM	I am just calling to see how you and Michael are doing.
NICOLE	Things are going well. Um, we're on our way to Crystal Banquet Hall.
KIM	Oh, that's my favourite venue. Thank you so much, Nicole. This means a lot to me.
NICOLE	Of course, Ms. Price.
KIM	I told you. It's Kim.
NICOLE	It's my pleasure, Kim. Oh! Ah, hold on. I am just getting a text message from my contact over at Crystal Banquet Hall.
KIM	Oh, what are they saying?
NICOLE	No, no, no, no, no, no.
KIM	What is it?
NICOLE	Oh, Kim. I'm sorry but they just gave their last slot to someone else.
KIM	What happened?
NICOLE	I am sorry. I promise we will find you something that is just as good!
KIM	We'll talk about it in the morning.
MICHAEL	So, ready to check out venue number two?
NICOLE	Um... Who did you talk to over at Crystal Banquet Hall?
MICHAEL	Who did I talk to?
NICOLE	Yeah. When you changed the time of our meeting, who did you confirm it with?
MICHAEL	Oh, no one. When I called it went to voice mail, so I just left a message.
NICOLE	Oh.
MICHAEL	What. What's wrong?
NICOLE	Well, Michael, there was a very slim chance that they were going to be able to slip us in and someone else has just booked our date.
MICHAEL	Sorry, I thought...
NICOLE	Knew we should've stuck to my schedule!
MICHAEL	Well, look, there's a bunch of other places that we're supposed to look at. Why don't we--
NICOLE	This was Kim's number one choice.
MICHAEL	Wh-what are you doing?
NICOLE	None of these other places will do. So, I'm going to make a new list. I'm going to find us something even better.
MICHAEL	I'm sorry.
NICOLE	But you can still go do the rest of the tours. Maybe, um, find us a back-up. I'm going to find a way to fix this.
MICHAEL	I was really just trying to help. I didn't--
NICOLE	Ah, I told them I work better on my own.
MICHAEL	Wow. Okay.
NICOLE	Hi. Is this Summer Ranch and Events? I, uh, could I please check your schedule? Yes, I'll hold.
NICOLE	(sighs)
MAGGIE	Hey!
NICOLE	Hey!
MAGGIE	So, how did it go?
NICOLE	I never want to see another banquet hall or photo garden again.
MAGGIE	Oof. Wow! These are beautiful.
NICOLE	Yeah. The venues were beautiful. Quick sidenote -- expensive as heck.
MAGGIE	I can imagine.
NICOLE	Oh, you don't have to imagine. The prices are right there on the back pages.
MAGGIE	Yikes. Well, at least you had the nephew to help you out.
NICOLE	Yeah... That didn't exactly work out. (laughs) He changed my schedule and we lost Kim's favourite venue.
MAGGIE	Why did he change your schedule? Had you made a mistake?
NICOLE	Seriously? Me? Mistake?
MAGGIE	Right.
NICOLE	He wanted to go to a sandwich shop!
MAGGIE	A sandwich shop?
NICOLE	In all fairness to him, it was an awesome sandwich and... it was kind of nice getting to know him. He actually seems like a good guy.
MAGGIE	That sounds promising.
NICOLE	Nope. Not promising.
MAGGIE	What did you do?
NICOLE	What I always do.
MAGGIE	You pushed him away and told him you work better on your own?
NICOLE	Bingo!
MAGGIE	Nicole!
NICOLE	What? I do work better on my own. But, ugh... I feel kind of bad about how I treated Michael.
MAGGIE	Well, can you fix it?
NICOLE	The Michael situation or the Kim situation?
MAGGIE	Both?
NICOLE	(laughs) I'd better. There is a lot riding on this. I can't let Kim down and I don't want to mess up this wedding. Uh! And now I have to go into work tomorrow and tell Kim why she can't have her favourite wedding venue.
MAGGIE	I'm sure she'll understand.
NICOLE	Yeah. Kim will understand.
KIM	I don't understand.
NICOLE	There was a mix-up with one of my schedules.
KIM	A mix-up? With one of your schedules? I don't believe it.
NICOLE	Unfortunately, it's true.
KIM	Oh, we loved that place.
NICOLE	So did Michael and I.
KIM	Wait... Did Michael mess things up?
NICOLE	Michael?
KIM	Yeah. I mean, the Nicole I know doesn't make mistakes but Michael, on the other hand, well...
NICOLE	Um... Actually... No. It wasn't Michael. It was me. I made a mistake.
KIM	Sure. Okay, well, no more mistakes. I need you two to go pull a few wedding dress options for me.
NICOLE	Wedding dress options?
KIM	Yeah. I mean, if I go myself, I will be there for days. So I just need you to weed out the ugly ones.
NICOLE	Okay.
KIM	I'm thinking... trumpet fit and flare. What do you think?
NICOLE	Uhhhh... Trumpet fitted and...?
KIM	Trumpet fit and flare. Michael will know what I'm talking about.
NICOLE	Trumpet fit and flare.
KIM	Peter! It is so nice to see you. Nicole, you know our CEO, Mr. Banks.
NICOLE	Oh! Uh, only by name, sir, but it's very nice to meet you.
MR. BANKS	Ah, yes. The young lady helping out with wedding plans.
NICOLE	That's me! That's me, sir.
MR. BANKS	I think it's great that you're helping Kim out. And planning a wedding in two weeks? I tell you, if you pull this off--
NICOLE	When I pull this off, sir.
MR. BANKS	When you pull this off... I'll be very impressed.
NICOLE	Well, on that note, I have a date. With some wedding dresses.
MR. BANKS	You know, the dress is the most important part.
NICOLE	Mm-hm. Mm-hm. (sighs) Very nice to meet you, sir. Bye-bye.
NICOLE	Please pick up. Please pick up. Please pick up!
MICHAEL	Hello?
NICOLE	Michael! Thank goodness you picked up. It's Nicole.
MICHAEL	Who?
NICOLE	Nicole. Kim's assistant. We're planning a wedding together?
MICHAEL	That's funny. I was planning a wedding with someone named Nicole but we parted ways yesterday because she works better on her own.
NICOLE	About that... (sighs) I'm sorry. I was way too... intense.
MICHAEL	It's okay. I get it. Doing a good job is important to you.
NICOLE	(heavy breath) You have no idea. Are you free right now? Can we meet up?
MICHAEL	Yeah, I'm just at a coffee shop. I can send you the address.
NICOLE	Great.
MICHAEL	But you might have to wait until I finish a set, though.
NICOLE	A what?
MICHAEL	I lose track of where you start And where I end Gotta confess I'd take time with you
NICOLE	Can I sit anywhere?
MICHAEL	Over all of my friends They think they know best, but no What do they know about love? Everyone's got an opinion about us But my love, my love Might be broke But it's broken just right Our love, our love This is what it's supposed to look like Yeah-ah-ah-ah. Hey.
NICOLE	Whoo!
MICHAEL	Thank you. That was an obscure band out of Portland that I just learned about from a friend called Roadside Rescue.
NICOLE	That's me! I'm the friend. You remembered!
MICHAEL	I was curious what kind of music you listen to so I looked them up.
NICOLE	They're good, right?
MICHAEL	Yeah.
NICOLE	And you? I mean… You did an amazing job with their song.
MICHAEL	Well, thank you.
NICOLE	I can't believe you remembered.
MICHAEL	Just think of it as my way to apologize for messing up your schedule.
NICOLE	(sighs) You were just trying to do something nice and... There was no way for you to know that we'd lose the venue.
CHARLIE	Michael.
MICHAEL	Charlie. So, what did you think?
CHARLIE	Very okay-ish.
NICOLE	Okay? (laughs) Are you kidding? That was amazing! A place like this should be lucky to have him.
MICHAEL	Nicole, I would like you to meet Charlie.
NICOLE	Hm.
MICHAEL	as in Charlie's Coffee Shop. Also known as the guy who hires me.
CHARLIE	Least I used to.
NICOLE	Oh. My. Gosh. I am so sorry! I didn't know.
CHARLIE	Just pulling your leg, young lady.
MICHAEL	Charlie and I go back a long time.
CHARLIE	Yeah. Longer than I care to admit. Just messing with each other.
NICOLE	Oh... Oh, my goodness! Wow. I, uh, I really thought I might have got you in trouble.
WAITRESS	Hey, Mike.
MICHAEL	Hey!
WAITRESS	What can I get you guys?
CHARLIE	Get him anything he wants, on the house.
MICHAEL	Hm.
CHARLIE	She pays double.
NICOLE	(laughs) He's just messing around, right?
MICHAEL	You know, I-I can never really tell with that guy.
NICOLE	Hm.
MICHAEL	I will have a black coffee, please. You?
NICOLE	Sure. The same. Thank you.
MICHAEL	Look at you! Making friends everywhere you go.
NICOLE	Oh, I didn't mean to.
MICHAEL	(laughs) Do you think he's really mad? Meh. 50-50.
NICOLE	Oh.
MICHAEL	Charlie's fine. What is up with you?
NICOLE	Okay. Listen... I really need your help with this wedding.
MICHAEL	Oh... Kay.
NICOLE	You know so much more about this stuff than I do. I mean, heck! I think you know more about this stuff than most people.
MICHAEL	Guilty.
NICOLE	I mean, there's the-the wedding venue, the wedding cake, caterers, music, flowers!
MICHAEL	Reception, first dance, menu, invitations, photographer, videographer--
NICOLE	Okay, I get it. There is a boatload of stuff that we have to do.
MICHAEL	Wait -- we?
NICOLE	Look, I can organize the heck out of anything. But... I really need this wedding to be something special.
MICHAEL	And that's where I come in. You see, I bring the magic.
NICOLE	Well, I said special but if you need to use the term magic, then knock yourself out.
MICHAEL	Honestly, we're going to need a little bit more than just magic to pull this off. We're going to need a miracle.
NICOLE	We?
MICHAEL	Okay, yes. I will help you plan this wedding.
NICOLE	Great! Okay, here's what I have for a plan of attack.
MICHAEL	Ahhh. You made-- You made charts? Graphs?
NICOLE	Yeah, I made charts and graphs and schedules! Doesn't everybody?
MICHAEL	No. Hey! Thank you.
WAITRESS	On the house.
NICOLE	Oooh.
MICHAEL	It's your lucky day.
NICOLE	(sighs) We are going to need it.
MICHAEL	Yes, we are. Here's to a wedding miracle.
NICOLE	To a miracle wedding.
MICHAEL	That's hot. So, decided to start with something easy, huh?
NICOLE	Kim just wanted us to pull a few dresses for her.
VICKY	Hello. I'm Vicky.
NICOLE	Hi. I'm Nicole. We spoke on the phone earlier.
VICKY	Yes! Pulling a few designs for your boss.
NICOLE	Yeah. And this is Michael.
MICHAEL	Hi.
NICOLE	He's here to help.
VICKY	Excellent. Well, uh, before we get started, do you have any idea of what your boss is looking for?
NICOLE	Something pretty.
VICKY	Something pretty?
NICOLE	Yeah. With one of those long things at the back, you know?
VICKY	A train?
NICOLE	Yes, that's it. A train.
VICKY	The bride wants a train.
NICOLE	Yeah. Maybe. A really, really long one. Oh, and can you do pockets?
VICKY	So, your boss wants something pretty with a long train and pockets?
NICOLE	Yeah. I mean, that sounds like a pretty good place to start.
VICKY	And for the silhouette?
NICOLE	The silhouette?
VICKY	Well, what's her body type.
NICOLE	(sigh) Kim's body type…
MICHAEL	Voluptuous?
NICOLE	Voluptuous. Yes! That's the word.
VICKY	So, no A-lines. Perhaps an empire?
NICOLE	Uh-huh.
MICHAEL	(sigh) You're doing a great job, but do you mind if I take over from here?
NICOLE	Please.
MICHAEL	Yes, the bride is a bit voluptuous, so an empire would be great. Or maybe a trumpet fit and flare.
NICOLE	Oh, yes! The trumpet thing! (sigh) She mentioned that.
MICHAEL	Great. So, we'll start with a trumpet fit and flare... I'm thinking scoop neck, sleeveless?
VICKY	Fabric?
MICHAEL	Jersey. Or chiffon.
VICKY	You really know your dresses. Let me guess -- three older sisters?
MICHAEL	Four.
VICKY	I think we may have something. Have a seat and I'll be right back.
MICHAEL	Oh, and, uh, let's hold off on the pockets, for now.
NICOLE	(tsks) Ah! Fine. I like pockets.
LINDA	I'm giving it all away tonight. I know when it's hard to find The words I need to write I know that trust is hard to find Just let me know  How I could ease your troubled mind Look in my eyes You think you try a spark Giving all your love to me All I know is how it goes How I could change this melody To fit your clothes It might take a while Hang on I don't want the extra mile If it's a test Are you  impressed? Can you open up your heart and renew
NICOLE	So... This is a ball gown. Whereas this one is a trumpet.
VICKY	And you can see how this one is fitted all the way down and then flares out around the knee.
NICOLE	Ah! Hence "fit and flare".
VICKY	Oh! Look at you picking up the lingo.
NICOLE	(laughter)
VICKY	Try it on! I'll show you.
NICOLE	Oh, no. That's... That's not necessary.
VICKY	It'd be good for you to see what these dresses look like on people.
NICOLE	Really?
VICKY	It might help you to pick a better dress for your boss. They say the dress is the most important part of the wedding.
NICOLE	Okay. Yeah, I'll try some on. Quickly.
MICHAEL	Julie, I'm sorry! Something came up, okay? Yes, it was last minute. I'm really sorry that you feel that way.
NICOLE	Vicky? Vicky. I can't seem to do up this strap.
MICHAEL	Here, I-- I can help you with that.
NICOLE	I, uh, thought you were on the phone.
MICHAEL	I was. (exhales) You look stunning.
NICOLE	Oh! Well, it is a very pretty dress, and I can see why most women like these things.
MICHAEL	The dress is okay, but... You? You make it sing.
VICKY	How are we making out in here?
NICOLE	We're not making out.
MICHAEL	(laughs)
VICKY	I meant with the dress.
NICOLE	Oh! (laughs) Um...?
MICHAEL	She looks beautiful.
NICOLE	(laughs) Whew! (laughs) Yep. Yeah, okay. So, we have two trumpet fit and flares and a more traditional empire, one of which she will probably take.
MICHAEL	Probably.
NICOLE	And... just in case she doesn't, we have a ball gown and a mini dress because, well, it's Kim.
VICKY	You guys have done a really good job. We'll put those aside for your boss and when she's ready, she can come by.
NICOLE	Thanks, Vicky.
MICHAEL	Okay! So, what's next on our schedule?
NICOLE	Oh! Our day is packed. We should probably get moving.
MICHAEL	Can you take care of the details here? I need to make a quick phone call. I'll meet you by the car?
NICOLE	Yeah. (sighs) Thanks again, Vicky. Um, I was wanting to ask: do you ever do sales?
VICKY	No.
NICOLE	Hm. It's a good thing Kim's rich! (laughs)
MICHAEL	I lose track of where you start and where I end
NICOLE	Yep.
MICHAEL	What do they know about love? Everyone's got an opinion about us What do you want to do? But our love Our love Might be broke But it's broken just by And our love Our love This is what it's supposed to look like Mm, mm, mm, mm. Sure you don't want one?
NICOLE	I'll try one little--
MICHAEL	Ah-ha. She's back.
NICOLE	One little bite.
MICHAEL	But would Kim like it?
NICOLE	I don't get it!
NICOLE	Hm. (sighing) I think this is the one. I think this is the one.
MICHAEL	This is the one. We have to book this place. I can't believe it's still available!
NICOLE	We need to book this. We need to book this.
MICHAEL	Okay. Keep your cool. We gotta negotiate a good price.
NICOLE	Okay.
CRISSIE	So, what do you two think?
MICHAEL	Meh.
NICOLE	Meh.
MICHAEL	I mean, it's kinda nice. I guess.
NICOLE	It could be, ah... Nicer. Or bigger.
MICHAEL	Right. Yeah, I don't know that this is going to really work.
NICOLE	Maybe if the price was good?
CRISSIE	Here's the price list.
MICHAEL	Ooh! Wow! Okay.
NICOLE	Yeah, we're going to need a little wiggle room if we're going to take it.
CRISSIE	I have two other parties interested in the space and they're looking at it this afternoon.
NICOLE & MICHAEL	We'll take it!
MICHAEL	Well, we did it. We got ourselves a venue.
NICOLE	(sighs) One thing down. 927 more to go.
MICHAEL	Come on! Even you've got to be excited about this!
NICOLE	Trust me, I couldn't be happier. If I'd made one more mistake, think Kim might have fired me.
MICHAEL	You told Kim it was your fault we lost the first venue?
NICOLE	Yeah.
MICHAEL	Why? It was my mistake.
NICOLE	Look, she might be my boss, but you're going to be family. You don't want to start off on the wrong foot, right?
MICHAEL	Thanks.
NICOLE	I may not be the "free spirit" you are but I can still be pretty cool.
MICHAEL	So I'm starting to see.
NICOLE	So, why are you this... "free spirit"?
MICHAEL	Free spirit?
NICOLE	I was being polite.
MICHAEL	(laughs) Thank you. Were your parents hippies?
NICOLE	Ah!
MICHAEL	I knew it!
NICOLE	No, the opposite actually. Corporate types. My whole family is. Like your Uncle Bradley? Hm. So you were the black sheep from birth?
MICHAEL	No, I was a suit-and-tie guy, too.
NICOLE	(scoffs) What happened?
MICHAEL	Well, uh, when I was in college my dad got really sick... Passed away.
NICOLE	Michael, I'm sorry. I didn't--
MICHAEL	It's okay. It was a long time ago. But it made me realize that life is short, you know? Can turn on a dime.
NICOLE	It's true.
MICHAEL	My entire family is CEO types, big-shot lawyers. Every time we have a family vacation it always turns into this competition about who's driving the more expensive car or who bought a vacation house where.
NICOLE	I can see how that would be annoying.
MICHAEL	But, as a kid, that's all I wanted. Suit, tie, briefcase.
NICOLE	And then your father passes away.
MICHAEL	And I realized that no matter how much money you make or however hard you work, it can all end in a second. So, why not have fun instead?
NICOLE	(laughs) So, you started to look at things a little differently.
MICHAEL	Yeah. I picked up the guitar, started singing in public. Just doing all of the things that I always wanted to do but I was too scared to.
NICOLE	Well, you, uh, got pretty good at the singing part, too.
MICHAEL	Well, thank you. I want my life to be more about experiences than money.
NICOLE	So, is this where the idea of "Mr. Romance" came to be?
MICHAEL	No, uh, I've been a hopeless romantic since junior high.
NICOLE	Ah.
MICHAEL	You know, deep down, I think everybody is a romantic.
NICOLE	(laughs)
MICHAEL	Yeah, present company included.
NICOLE	Really?
MICHAEL	Really. Sometimes you just have to dig a little deeper.
NICOLE	Oh! Bradley!
BRADLEY	Hi! Nicky. Hey, great job on the wedding venue. Kim and I love it.
NICOLE	Thanks. I'm happy to help.
BRADLEY	Is she around?
NICOLE	Uh...
KIM	If by "she" you mean your future wife, then "she" is right here.
BRADLEY	Pumpkin.
KIM	Sugar bear. Mwah.
BRADLEY	(laughs)
KIM	Ah, Nicole, you know that Bradley and I have been so impressed with everything you've been able to accomplish.
BRADLEY	Especially on such short notice.
NICOLE	I feel like there's a "but" coming.
BRADLEY	No, we're really happy with everything so far.
NICOLE	Oh.
KIM	But...
NICOLE	Ah.
KIM	We would love to add one thing to your plate.
NICOLE	Oh! Okay.
BRADLEY	See, I told you she'd be fine.
KIM	Bradley and I would like you and Michael to plan a small little engagement party.
NICOLE	An engagement party?
KIM	Yeah.
BRADLEY	Yeah. Nothing crazy, just a few dozen family members.
NICOLE	Uh-huh.
KIM	Yeah, Bradley and I were hoping to get away without doing one, but a lot of family have been asking to meet before the big day.
NICOLE	Yeah.
BRADLEY	Again, nothing crazy. Maybe a private room at a really nice restaurant?
NICOLE	Okay.
KIM	Just close family and maybe a few (clears throat) executives from this firm?
NICOLE	Executives from this firm?
BRADLEY	Obviously, you and Michael would be invited, too, and I think you two should bring dates.
NICOLE	Oh.
KIM	Oh, Sugar Bear. Nicole doesn't do the dating scene.
NICOLE	Hm.
BRADLEY	Neither does Michael.
NICOLE	Really?
KIM	But he's so cute!
BRADLEY	Yeah, he's all about romance, but when it comes down to actually asking a woman out, he's, uh... No-such-luck.
NICOLE	Huh.
KIM	So, Nicole, do you think that this is something that you and Michael can pull off?
NICOLE	Oh! An engagement party? Ha-ha. That's no problem.
KIM	Great.
BRADLEY	Bam. Bam. Whoosh.
NICOLE	Bam?
MICHAEL	An engagement party? That's crazy.
NICOLE	 I know, but they really want it and I can't let Kim down.
MICHAEL	I know a few restaurants I can reach out to. Leave it to me.
NICOLE	Great. Michael, I would not be able to pull this off without you. I... I owe you one.
MICHAEL	Well, actually, I was about to give you a call.
NICOLE	Yeah. What's up?
MICHAEL	I need a favour.
NICOLE	Oh. Sure. Anything.
MICHAEL	You're not going to like it.
NICOLE	Come on. Come on. Yes. Yes. Come on. No! Don't eat that. All right, let's go this way. Come on.
MICHAEL	(laughs)
NICOLE	Come on, Corgi.
MICHAEL	Now, this is a sight to see. I feel like I should take a picture.
NICOLE	Don't you dare.
MICHAEL	I thought you didn't like dogs?
NICOLE	I'm warming up to them. I think, uh... I think Thorgi likes me.
MICHAEL	Thorgi is a good judge of character. I really appreciate this. Thank you.
NICOLE	You owe me big time.
MICHAEL	I just had a meeting with a club owner. They want to hire me to play two nights a week.
NICOLE	Oh, my gosh! That's amazing! Congratulations.
MICHAEL	Thank you. There's record executives in there all the time. Like, this could turn into something really big for me.
NICOLE	I'm so happy for you! (clearing throat)
MICHAEL	Oh, we're doing that?
NICOLE	(laughs)
MICHAEL	Okay, well, I couldn't have done it without you.
NICOLE	Well, I wouldn't be pulling off this wedding stuff if it wasn't for you, so we're even.
MICHAEL	Still, I know you don't love dogs, so I feel like, maybe, I owe you dinner or something?
NICOLE	Dinner like a... Like a date? But I-- I thought you and your ex were...?
MICHAEL	We tried. It's not going to happen.
NICOLE	How could it not work out? You are such an amazing guy.
MICHAEL	(laughs) Thank you. But I could say the same for you.
NICOLE	What do you mean?
MICHAEL	Well, we've been working together on this wedding for a while now and, I don't know, from my perspective, you are... you're smart, you're funny, you're beautiful, you're passionate about your work.
NICOLE	Guilty as charged.
MICHAEL	So... What's the deal with you not having a boyfriend?
NICOLE	I don't know.
MICHAEL	I mean, other than you're dislike of dogs, I can't see anything wrong with you.
NICOLE	I wasn't always Miss Grumpy Pants about romance. I just thought my last boyfriend was "the one", you know?
MICHAEL	I know the feeling, sure.
NICOLE	But when I'd ask him about our future together, he'd... always say he wasn't ready to get married, and...
MICHAEL	And?
NICOLE	Well, the break-up crushed me. I'd always pictured us getting married, buying a house, having kids. You know, the whole nine yards.
MICHAEL	Okay, but, I mean, everybody has bad break-ups. It's no reason to turn your back on love.
NICOLE	Well… Like a month after we broke up, I saw that he was engaged to his ex.
MICHAEL	Ah.
NICOLE	So, it wasn't that he didn't want to get married. It's just that he didn't want to get married to me.
MICHAEL	I'm sorry. Wow. So, I guess planning a wedding wasn't exactly on the top of your to-do list?
NICOLE	No, it wasn't. (laughs)
MICHAEL	There it is.
NICOLE	What?
MICHAEL	Your laugh. I love it when I make you laugh.
NICOLE	Um... So, Kim and Bradley's engagement party?
MICHAEL	Yes, the engagement party. Uh, so -- come on, guys -- I called... I called a couple of places. What I found out is that there are a million people trying to get space right now, but we have a good shot...
NICOLE	Oh, yeah?
MICHAEL	'Cause Kim has a lot of money.
NICOLE	(laughs)
MICHAEL	And they like money.
NICOLE	They do. They do.
MICHAEL	That's generally the way it works. Yeah, so, we'll see. Money makes the world go 'round, right?
MAGGIE	Hey!
NICOLE	Hey!
MAGGIE	How's the wedding stuff going?
NICOLE	Good. We found a venue, we locked down a bunch of vendors -- cake, flowers, DJ. And I even walked Michael's dogs for him.
MAGGIE	But you hate dogs?
NICOLE	I know, but he needed a favour.
MAGGIE	So, team Nicole and Michael seems to be working out?
NICOLE	Oh, I could not have done this without Michael.
MAGGIE	What was that?
NICOLE	What?
MAGGIE	You just smiled and tucked your hair behind your ear when you said Michael. You only do that when you like people. You like Michael?
NICOLE	What? No! No, I don't. Don't be weird.
MAGGIE	Me weird? You're weird.
NICOLE	You're having marshmallows for dinner.
MAGGIE	Okay, don't change the subject. Do you like Michael? No, we're just... Wedding planning buddies. (clears throat)
MAGGIE	Huh.
NICOLE	Huh, what?
MAGGIE	Nothing. Just curious. You said "buddies", not "friends".
NICOLE	So?
MAGGIE	Well, most people would have said "friends", not "buddies".
NICOLE	Oh, eat your marshmallows!
MAGGIE	I'm just wondering if you're not trying to friend-zone this guy.
NICOLE	Well, what's wrong with having male friends?
MAGGIE	Nothing. So long as it doesn't prevent you from finding a boyfriend.
NICOLE	Michael's just a really nice guy.
MAGGIE	You just did it again!
NICOLE	Oh! So?
MAGGIE	(inhales) But wait, I thought he was trying to get back together with his ex?
NICOLE	Hm. Yes, yes, yes. That did not work out.
MAGGIE	You like him.
NICOLE	(scoffs) Ah! (sigh) There you are. What are you doing? People are starting to get here.
MICHAEL	Um... Just, um...
NICOLE	Whoa! Why do you look so nervous?
MICHAEL	I'm fine.
NICOLE	Wait, is there-- Is there a problem I should know about?
MICHAEL	No, I'm good. I'm good.
NICOLE	(gasps) Did we forget to order dessert?
MICHAEL	No. Dessert is here.
NICOLE	So, what's up?
MICHAEL	(sighs) It's just... My family...
NICOLE	Well, they should be arriving any minute.
MICHAEL	That's the problem! I don't do well with family get-togethers. At least, not when it's my own family.
NICOLE	I know family can be difficult.
MICHAEL	They're just, they're so successful. And I'm...
NICOLE	Amazing. Listen, I've had to spend a lot of time with you these last few days and you are... a really amazing guy.
MICHAEL	You hated me the first time that we met.
NICOLE	Oh, first impressions don't count.
MICHAEL	Really?
NICOLE	Well, maybe most of them do, but not this one.
MICHAEL	(chuckles)
NICOLE	Seriously, do you not see what a great person you are?
MICHAEL	Yeah. You know, you're right.
NICOLE	Hm.
MICHAEL	Besides, they're all on their third marriage, anyway, so what do they know, right?
NICOLE	Well, I know that you are the guy who helped me pick out a wedding dress the day after I yelled at him.
MICHAEL	True.
NICOLE	The dress, the cake, the flowers... All the things that people are going to really love, I mean, that's all you. You really helped me. And Kim, by the way, through all of this. (inhales shakily)
MICHAEL	Thank you.
NICOLE	So, let's get out there and give them the old -- whap-ah! -- one, two punch.
MICHAEL	Ha! Okay.
NICOLE	Go!
MICHAEL	All right. Thank you.
NICOLE	I'm going to go.
MICHAEL	I will be right behind you.
NICOLE	Ooh!
MICHAEL	Look out.
NICOLE	Oh! That-a-way!
MICHAEL	(deep exhale)
NICOLE	Hi. (sigh) You are doing a horrible job at trying to hide.
MICHAEL	Maybe if I go hide in the bathroom?
NICOLE	They'll find you.
MICHAEL	I meant the bathroom in my apartment.
NICOLE	(laughs) See, just go take that wit and humour and go talk to somebody. Nope. Uhh! Well, I've talked to a bunch of your family and they seem nice.
TREVOR	Hey, Mikey! How the heck are you?
MICHAEL	Uncle Trevor. I'm good. This is Nicole. Nicole, this is Bradley's brother, Trevor.
NICOLE	It is so nice to meet you.
TREVOR	She your girlfriend?
MICHAEL	No, we're just friends.
NICOLE	(laughs)
TREVOR	And work? You're still playing guitar in subway stations for pocket change? (laughs)
MICHAEL	I also get free coffee when I work at coffee shops.
NICOLE	(laughing)
TREVOR	Why don't you just come and work for me?
MICHAEL	I already have a job.
NICOLE	He is, actually, an amazing musician. You know, he just booked a gig-
MICHAEL	It's okay, Nicole.
TREVOR	What time is it? Oh! Here... Let's have a look at my really expensive watch. Will you look at that? It's time for someone to grow up.
NICOLE	Hey, I will tell you something, sir-
MICHAEL	Nicole, it is okay.
TREVOR	I'm going to say hi to your cousins. The wife and I bought a cottage this summer and, uh, I'm going to go tell them about it.
NICOLE	Hm. So, you're Uncle Trevor's a jerk.
MICHAEL	Thank you for trying to stick up for me but it's just not worth it. Trust me.
NICOLE	Let's mingle.
MICHAEL	You know, I think I'm going to go get some fresh air.
KIM	Nicole. You remember Mr. Banks.
NICOLE	Yes. Mr. Banks, it's so good to see you again.
MR. BANKS	You as well, Nicole. Kim tells me things are coming along swimmingly.
NICOLE	Oh. Yes, sir.
KIM	Nonsense. Nicole here is being humble. Bradley and I wouldn't be able to put any of this together without her help.
MR. BANKS	Very impressive. You know, we have a promotion coming up soon. We always want to add new people to our team.
NICOLE	Well, I mean... I would love an opportunity to prove myself, Mr. Banks.
KIM	Well, maybe we should all sit down some time and discuss it?
MR. BANKS	Sounds good.
NICOLE	Sounds Good.
KIM	Let me introduce you to some of my future in-laws.
NICOLE	Thank you. (squeals)
BRADLEY	Don't be silly. We'll still be able see each other. Of course. Just not as much. Honey Bunny, you are the most important woman in the world to me. Hey, I told you -- it's a different kind of love with Kim. It's true. I will always love you. It'll just be a few weeks until things settle and then we can plan our next secret adventure. Anywhere you want to meet, Honey Bunny. Of course. I promise. I love you.
NICOLE	Okay. Yes. Can't talk now, Trevor! Michael!
MICHAEL	Hey, there you are. I was looking for you.
NICOLE	Michael, I need to talk to you.
MICHAEL	Can it wait until tomorrow? I gotta drive a couple people home.
NICOLE	No, I need to talk to you now.
MICHAEL	What's up?
KIM	Hey, you two. I just wanted to thank you again for a lovely evening.
MICHAEL	It was our pleasure.
NICOLE	Yeah. Happy to help.
KIM	Michael, I think I'm going to fit in so well with your family.
MICHAEL	(laughs) They all love you.
KIM	Are you leaving?
MICHAEL	Yeah, I have to drive a couple people home.
KIM	Oh, but you're staying?
NICOLE	Yeah. Yeah.
KIM	Great.
MICHAEL	Oh, there was something you wanted to talk to me about?
NICOLE	Nope. Uh, nothing important. We can talk about it tomorrow.
MICHAEL	Okay. Are you sure? It seemed pretty important.
KIM	Is everything okay?
NICOLE	Yeah. Everything is great. Uh, it's just one little, teensy, weensy, little... detail.
MICHAEL	Okay, great. So give me a call tomorrow, all right?
NICOLE	Yeah.
KIM	Thank you.
MICHAEL	Congrats, Kim.
KIM	And there is my handsome fiancé.
BRADLEY	Ladies.
KIM	Mm. Isn't he amazing?
NICOLE	Yeah. Amazing!
MICHAEL	Are you sure?
NICOLE	Yes!
MICHAEL	Are you absolutely sure?
NICOLE	Yes!
MICHAEL	Are you positive, 'cause--
NICOLE	No. Well, yes! I know what I heard. Last night your uncle told another woman that he loved her.
MICHAEL	But you didn't see this woman?
NICOLE	Well, he was on the phone. But I heard him call her "Honey Bunny." And they talked about secret meetings.
NICOLE & MICHAEL	(sighing)
MICHAEL	Come on, Bradley. The one uncle I actually looked up to.
NICOLE	And everybody asks me why I'm so cynical about love. I mean, huh!
MICHAEL	This is horrible. I will talk to Bradley. You need to tell Kim.
NICOLE	I know. But...
MICHAEL	What?
NICOLE	But she is so happy. And our boss, Mr. Banks? He seems to be really impressed with all the work I've been-- we've been doing, putting this wedding together so quickly.
MICHAEL	So?
NICOLE	Well, he alluded to the idea that I might be up for a promotion. And if I tell Kim now that her fiancé is cheating on her, I mean... (laughs) That'll ruin everything.
MICHAEL	Bradley cheating on Kim is ruining everything. This isn't on you. You're going to put off telling your friend--
NICOLE	My boss.
MICHAEL	You're not going to tell her because you think it might jeopardise your chances at a promotion? Nicole. Okay. I will tell Kim. She's my family, after all.
NICOLE	Wait, Michael... It'll just be worse coming from you. I'm the one that overheard the call. I should be the one to tell her. Promise me you won't talk to your uncle?
MICHAEL	Sure. Whatever.
NICOLE	Just give me a few days and I will figure everything out.
MICHAEL	Look, I get that you're this super-cynical person when it comes to romance and marriage. And maybe the idea of someone cheating on their fiancé days before their wedding is a reason to justify continuing to feel that way.
NICOLE	Michael.
MICHAEL	But for the rest of us, this is important. Marriage, romance. Love? These things do exist, Nicole, whether you want to believe in them or not.
NICOLE	Or maybe I was right to be skeptical all these years. Maybe we live in a world where "true love" just doesn't exist?
MICHAEL	People fall in love, Nicole.
NICOLE	Yeah, well, prove it. (sighs)
MICHAEL	Up until five minutes ago I thought I was falling in love with you.
NICOLE	Michael, I... I am going to fix this. I will tell her. I promise. Just give me a few days.
MICHAEL	Cool. I'll hold off on talking to Bradley until you tell Kim. I really hope you make the right decision, Nicole.
NICOLE	(deep sigh)
MAGGIE	He said he was in love with you?
NICOLE	He said he was falling in love with me, but he hadn't fallen.
MAGGIE	And now?
NICOLE	He's not picking up his phone or answering his texts.
MAGGIE	So what are you going to do?
NICOLE	I mean, he's right. I need to tell Kim. But she's so... happy. And then there's this promotion and... I just need some time to work something out. Maybe Kim will figure out that Bradley's cheating on her own?
MAGGIE	Nicole...
NICOLE	I'll figure it out. I always do.
MAGGIE	And Michael?
NICOLE	Well, apparently, he's not my biggest fan right now. But there's only a few things left to take care of before the wedding and... I'll handle them on my own.
MAGGIE	This thing with you and Michael stopped being about wedding planning a long time ago. He said he was falling in love with you?
NICOLE	Yeah. Well, it doesn't really matter anymore, does it?
MAGGIE	Unless... you were falling for him, too.
NICOLE	(heavy breathing) (clears throat) Kim? Hi, Mr. Banks. Kim... (sighs) Can I talk to You about something, privately, for a moment? Maybe in your office?
KIM	Perfect timing, Nicole, because there is something that I would like to talk to you about, as well.
NICOLE	Okay. Look, the thing is I--
KIM	You got the promotion!
MR. BANKS	Congratulations.
NICOLE	(gasps)
KIM	You earned this, Nicole. Your attention to detail, your meticulous planning, your teamwork. You have done so much for this company. And, on a personal note, you've done so much for Bradley and I. This wedding is going to be the best day of my life. And I owe it all to you. Thank you. (emotional sigh)
NICOLE	I, um... I don't know what to say.
KIM	(sighs) I am so happy right now. (inhales; laughs) I'm sorry. What-what is it that you wanted to talk to me about?
NICOLE	Um... (exhales) It can wait.
KIM	(contented sigh)
NICOLE	(squealing)
MICHAEL	Congratulations.
NICOLE	Michael.
MICHAEL	I hear you got a promotion.
NICOLE	Michael, I--
MICHAEL	It's okay. I get it.
NICOLE	I really wanted to tell Kim. But I kept putting it off and putting it off and -- uh! She is so happy.
MICHAEL	Huh.
NICOLE	And now, here we are. What do I do?
MICHAEL	On the day she's getting married?
NICOLE	Exactly.
MICHAEL	To a man who's cheating on her.
NICOLE	Sh-sh-sh! Sh-sh-sh-sh! Someone could hear you.
MICHAEL	So long as Kim doesn't, you'll still get your promotion.
NICOLE	Uh! Michael... I get that you think I'm this horrible person.
MICHAEL	That's just it. I-- I know you're an amazing person. You're one of the most amazing people I have ever met. That's the problem.
NICOLE	The problem?
MICHAEL	If you had just been a jerk this whole time and not this smart, funny, incredible woman, this wouldn't be so hard.
NICOLE	What wouldn't be so hard?
MICHAEL	Seeing a really good person make a really bad decision. Look, I'm sorry that the-- the romance gods haven't been kinder to Nicole Waters. I really am. But I started to think maybe there was a good reason for it.
NICOLE	Wait. You think I've spent all these years having bad luck at love for a good reason? What reason would that be?
MICHAEL	So you'd still be single by the time we got a chance to meet in the park that day. I'm going to go check on the reception area. Everything here looks to be about as good as it can be.
NICOLE	(sighs)
MARVIN	You look beautiful.
NICOLE	Kim! You look amazing.
KIM	Thank you. Nicole, this place is beautiful. You and Michael did such a great job finding it.
NICOLE	(deep sigh) You deserve it.
KIM	Do you remember my parents, Kathleen and Marvin?
NICOLE	Of course I do. It's nice to see you both again.
KIM	So, how's the wedding area looking?
NICOLE	They're just putting the finishing touches on it now.
KIM	And the officiant?
NICOLE	I spoke to him a few minutes ago. He should be here any moment.
KIM	And what about the reception area?
NICOLE	The tent went up last night and they're just setting up the tables and place settings.
KIM	Oh! And what about--
KATHLEEN	Kim, darling, this young lady has everything under control.
KIM	You're right, Mom. Nicole, thank you so much for everything you've done. And she will make sure nothing bad happens to you today.
NICOLE	Your mom's right. (laughs) Today is going to be perfect.
KIM	(squeals)
NICOLE	(deep sigh)
MARVIN	When Kim's mother and I got married, we had the service in my parent's backyard.
NICOLE	(laughs)
MARVIN	My mother and aunts did all the decorations. My father grilled steaks for the adults and hotdogs for the kids.
NICOLE	That sounds amazing.
MARVIN	Mm, it wasn't much but... here we are, almost 45 years later -- still head over heels in love.
NICOLE	Really?
MARVIN	Yeah. Kim hasn't been that lucky yet, but let's hope she finds it with Bradley.
KATHLEEN	Nicole, darling, that dress is so beautiful, and I know you helped pick it out.
NICOLE	I had some help, actually.
KATHLEEN	Marvin, is she not the most beautiful bride you have ever seen in your life?
MARVIN	You mean the second most beautiful bride.
KATHLEEN	Aww...
NICOLE	Actually, could I have a moment with Kim? Alone?
KATHLEEN	Everything's okay, right?
NICOLE	Yes, I just have something very important that I need to tell her.
KATHLEEN	Sure, dear. Come on, hon, we're going to make sure Bradley arrived.
NICOLE	(deep sigh)
REBECCA	Hey.
MICHAEL	Rebecca, it's good to see you. It's been a long time.
REBECCA	Baby Bear, let's go!
MICHAEL	Hey, Sam! Long time, no see!
SAMANTHA	Hi.
REBECCA	Oh, Sam, it's time to put away the tablet.
MICHAEL	That is a very cool dress you got there, Sam.
REBECCA	What do you say?
SAMANTHA	Thank you.
MICHAEL	You're welcome.
BRADLEY	(contented sigh) Michael!
MICHAEL	Bradley.
BRADLEY	Honey Bunny, where's your purse?
SAMANTHA	I don't know.
MICHAEL	What di-what did you say?
BRADLEY	Samantha is supposed to have a purse that matches her mom's.
REBECCA	Oh, we look so adorable next to each other.
MICHAEL	Uh, what did you just call her?
BRADLEY	Honey Bunny. Just a nickname.
MICHAEL	Do you always call her that?
BRADLEY	There's my future in-laws.
KATHLEEN/MARVIN	Bradley./How are you?
BRADLEY	Good. How are you guys?
KATHLEEN	You holding up?
MICHAEL	Mr. and Mrs. Price, have you seen Nicole anywhere?
MARVIN	Yeah, she's with Kim in the bride's dressing area. She said she had something to tell her and it seemed serious.
MICHAEL	Okay. Thanks. Excuse me.
KATHLEEN	Is everything okay?
BRADLEY	I don't know. But this is beautiful, isn't it?
KATHLEEN	I know.
MARVIN	Must have cost a pretty penny?
BRADLEY	Yeah. Well, it's coming out of your pocket.
MICHAEL	Nicole, Nicole, wait-wait-wait! You told her?
KIM	You mean did she tell me that your uncle is a jerk?
MICHAEL	That's just the thing! He's not.
NICOLE	Michael, it's all right. I told Kim everything because you were right. I have to do the right thing, no matter what.
MICHAEL	(sigh) I was wrong.
NICOLE	How so?
BRADLEY	Michael, is, uh, everything all right?
KIM	No, everything's not okay, you cheater!
MICHAEL	(sigh)
BRADLEY	Cheater?
REBECCA	Hey! Is everyone okay?
KIM	Rebecca?
MICHAEL	Nicole, uh, this is Bradley's first wife, Rebecca.
NICOLE	Hi.
REBECCA	Oh, Kim! You look beautiful.
KIM	Oh. Not that it matters right now, but thank you.
BRADLEY	What's going on here.
MICHAEL	Rebecca and Bradley have a daughter, Samantha.
NICOLE	Uh-huh.
MICHAEL	Uncle Bradley, what is your nickname for Sam?
BRADLEY	My nickname for her?
MICHAEL	Please, it's important
BRADLEY	Honey Bunny. I call her Honey Bunny.
NICOLE	Honey Bunny?
MICHAEL	Yes.
KIM	So?
BRADLEY	Uh, yeah, so what?
NICOLE	Oh, no.
KIM	Okay, somebody better tell me what's going on right now!
NICOLE	Kim... Kim, when I overheard Bradley talking to another woman the other night, he called her Honey Bunny.
KIM	Oh.
BRADLEY	Uh, I don't understand what's going on.
MICHAEL	The other night at dinner, Nicole overheard you on the phone telling another woman that you loved her.
NICOLE	I thought that you were cheating on Kim.
BRADLEY	Cheating?
KIM	Cheating.
NICOLE	But now I realize you-- You were just talking to your daughter. Honey Bunny was your daughter. There is no other woman.
BRADLEY	Of course I was talking to my daughter. Pumpkin, I am head over heels in love with you and only you. I love you more than any woman that I've ever loved before. Ooh. No offence.
REBECCA	None taken.
BRADLEY	Yeah.
REBECCA	Oh! I'm just going to go.
BRADLEY	Oop! I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
KIM	Oh, Bradley.
BRADLEY	I love you.
KIM	And I love you, too.
BRADLEY	What do you say we go get married?
KIM	I think that is the best idea I've heard all day.
BRADLEY	(chuckles)
MICHAEL	(sighs) I can't believe you did it; you actually told her.
NICOLE	And look at the mess I made. Really should've kept my big mouth shut, huh?
MICHAEL	Well, I don't think anybody expected you to do that.
NICOLE	(sighs)
MICHAEL	Hey, I'm proud of you.
NICOLE	I'm sorry if I let you down, Michael. I should have told Kim earlier, even if it was a big mistake.
MICHAEL	It's okay.
NICOLE	No, it's not. I may have a bad track record when it comes to true love, but I-I shouldn't let that change my principles.
MICHAEL	Everything turned out okay.
NICOLE	I just want you to know that I am better than that.
MICHAEL	Nicole, over the last two weeks I think I've gotten to know the real you.
NICOLE	The other day when we had that fight, you said something.
MICHAEL	I said something? What did I say?
NICOLE	You sorta said... that you were... kinda falling in love with me.
MICHAEL	I did.
NICOLE	Well, I want you to know... that I am kinda sorta... falling in love with you, too.
MICHAEL	Sorry, I didn't quite catch--
NICOLE	I feel like you heard me. I said that I was falling in love with you.
KIM	(clears throat) I, uh, I forgot my flowers. I'm just gonna--
MICHAEL	Okay.
KIM	I'm sorry.
MICHAEL	(chuckles)
KIM	Okay. Ah... I knew you two would fall for each other. (clicks tongue)
NICOLE	Ooh... That's not what was happening.
MICHAEL	We were just talking about music for your thing, uh...
NICOLE	Music.
MICHAEL	For your--
KIM	Right.
NICOLE	Ooh! Come on, let's get out there.
MICHAEL	Or we could just skip it? I mean, you've seen one wedding, you've seen 'em all, right?
NICOLE	We spent the last two weeks working our butts off trying to pull this wedding together.
MICHAEL	But I know a place around the corner that makes the best sandwiches.
NICOLE	I love that about you.
MICHAEL	(laughs)
NICOLE	Whoo-hoo!
NICOLE	There you have it. Who would've thought that I, one, Nicole Waters, forever unlucky in love, would find my soulmate while planning my boss's wedding?
