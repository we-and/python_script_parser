THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	Helping others... 

THOMAS	When Emily broke down she needed big, strong Caitlin's help to get to the Steamworks.

THOMAS	Emily was impressed with how fast and streamlined Caitlin was and thought that Caitlin was the Best Engine Ever!

THOMAS 	But later that day, it was Caitlin that needed help. 

THOMAS 	Her brakes had failed and she was racing down the hill out of control!

THOMAS 	Luckily, Emily was there to rescue her. She used her brakes to bring Caitlin safely to a stop. 

THOMAS 	Then it was Emily's turn to take Caitlin to the Steamworks. 

THOMAS 	And this time it was Caitlin who thought that Emily was the Best Engine Ever. 

THOMAS  	So, when you help others, you're not just doing something nice for them... It makes you feel good too!

THOMAS	That's why helping others is a great thing to do!
