INTERTITLE	England 1937

CHARLES	Come on, you blithering idiot.

CHARLES	There's only 26 letters in the damned alphabet.

CHARLES	All you've got to do is put them in the right bloody order.

CHARLES	Write something.

CHARLES	Anything.

NARRATIVE TITLE	CHARLES CONDOMINE CRIME FICTION AWARD FOR SERVICES TO LITERATURE

NARRATIVE TITLE	HELP

CHARLES	Right. Music.

RUTH	Charles.

CHARLES	Think.

RUTH	Charles?

RUTH	Darling?

RUTH	Charles? They can hear you in Timbuktu!

RUTH	Much obliged.

RUTH	If you insist on living like a nocturnal animal,

RUTH	at least be civil enough to hide your tracks.

RUTH	Morning, Edith.

EDITH	Good morning, ma'am.

RUTH	He's finally gone through with it.

EDITH	Oh, yes. Scandalous, isn't it?

RUTH	On the contrary,

RUTH	I think giving up the throne for love is awfully romantic.

RUTH	I'll have a grilled grapefruit and a strong coffee, please.

EDITH	Mr Condomine's asked for his eggs to be brought over to his study again.

RUTH	Well, given his mood, I hope they're being served sunny side up.

EDNA	Here we go. Two soft-boiled eggs.

EDNA	For William Shakespeare.

EDNA	And what does Her Majesty want this morning?

EDITH	She's sticking to the Hollywood diet.

EDNA	Hollywood diet.

EDNA	It'll take a lot more than an exotic fruit to turn her into Greta Garbo.

EDNA	And don't dilly-dally in the garden, Edith.

EDNA	He'll only send it back if the toast is cold.

CHARLES	I'm not a bad man.

CHARLES	I mean, yes, I like to flirt a bit.

CHARLES	And the occasional flutter.

EDITH	Excuse me, sir. Your breakfast.

CHARLES	Edith.

EDITH	Yes, sir?

CHARLES	Would you remind Edna that the word 'toast'

CHARLES	is derived from the Latin 'tostare',

CHARLES	meaning 'to scorch' or 'to roast'?

CHARLES	Whereas this...

CHARLES	is a cold, hard piece of bread.

EDITH	Apologies, sir.

EDITH	Do you need anything else?

CHARLES	Divine intervention.

RUTH	It's wonderfully patriotic, Harold.

RUTH	You've really excelled yourself.

RUTH	And I'm certain the judges will agree.

CHARLES	How was it so easy for you,

CHARLES	my Manhattan muse?

RUTH	Charles.

RUTH	You really should be praying to Cadmus and not decapitating him.

CHARLES	I'm sorry.

RUTH	You've been commissioned to write a 90-page screenplay,

RUTH	not War and Peace.

CHARLES	I'm at my wits' end.

RUTH	I just don't understand how it could be so problematic

RUTH	to adapt a story that you've already written.

RUTH	I'm sorry, Charles.

RUTH	I just don't know how long I can go on like this,

RUTH	with you stuck in an imaginary world and me alone in the real one.

RUTH	I miss you.

RUTH	I miss us.

CHARLES	So do I.

CHARLES	Look at that.

CHARLES	Just found it amongst some papers.

RUTH	It's sweet of you to try and spare my feelings.

RUTH	And a little naive.

CHARLES	Why?

RUTH	Because you imagine that I mind you thinking of Elvira.

CHARLES	Well, don't you?

RUTH	No. I'm not in the least bit jealous of her.

RUTH	I just wonder if I died,

RUTH	whether you'd continue to look at photographs of me.

CHARLES	Darling.

CHARLES	You're not the dying type.

RUTH	He's simply incorrigible, Violet.

RUTH	I found him mooning over pictures of Elvira yesterday.

MRS BRADMAN	Elvira?

RUTH	He's been shirking work and pining for the ex-wife.

RUTH	Game, set and match.

MRS BRADMAN	There's really nothing to feel insecure about.

MRS BRADMAN	Elvira may have been very attractive, but the poor woman's gone.

RUTH	As has the spark in our relationship.

MRS BRADMAN	Charles is a man.

MRS BRADMAN	You can't expect him to juggle more than one thing at a time.

MRS BRADMAN	My advice: leave him to worry about the words

MRS BRADMAN	and find someone else to shake your sheets.

MRS BRADMAN	Come on, don't be a prude.


MRS BRADMAN	One must be practical for a marriage to run the course.

TENNIS COACH	Do you remember what you learned in our last lesson, Mrs Bradman?

MRS BRADMAN	Strong, firm grip. How could I forget?

DR BRADMAN	So, what seems to be the trouble, old chap?

CHARLES	Things don't seem to be flowing as they used to.

DR BRADMAN	Name me a wordsmith who hasn't wrestled

DR BRADMAN	with a bout of writer's block once in a while.

CHARLES	The truth is, it's not just the words that have dried up.

CHARLES	Big Ben's stopped chiming.

CHARLES	Mr Peasbody's got stage fright.

DR BRADMAN	You poor fellow.

CHARLES	It's like playing billiards with a rope.

DR BRADMAN	Try a couple of these. Should put some fuel back in your tank.

CHARLES	What are they?

DR BRADMAN	Benzedrine sulphate.

DR BRADMAN	Amphetamine.

DR BRADMAN	Enhances cheerfulness, alertness,

DR BRADMAN	and, as Violet will testify, does wonders for your libido.

CHARLES	Sounds too good to be true. Is it habit forming?

DR BRADMAN	No, not at all. Been using them for years.

RUTH	Slow down. Charles, you'll give us both a coronary.

CHARLES	I've never felt more alive.

RUTH	Why? What's happened?

CHARLES	I decided to take your advice and look on the positives.

CHARLES	Surely it's better to be up than down.

RUTH	I just don't want you to exhaust yourself

RUTH	before the medium show at the theatre tonight.

CHARLES	Nobody in their right mind would waste a perfectly pleasant evening

CHARLES	pretending to be fascinated by someone

CHARLES	holding a one-way conversation.

NARRATIVE TITLE	MADAME ARCATI WORLD RENOWNED MEDIUM

ANNOUNCER	Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.

ANNOUNCER	This evening's performance will commence in two minutes.

MRS BRADMAN	Isn't that your cook?

MRS BRADMAN	And your maid?

RUTH	Oh, yes.

RUTH	So it is. Poor Edith.

RUTH	She's been very taken with this sort of thing since she lost her brother

RUTH	fighting the fascists in Spain.

DR BRADMAN	Primitive superstition can be very persuasive,

DR BRADMAN	especially with the emotionally susceptible.

MANDEEP SINGH	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an evening

MANDEEP SINGH	that will change your perceptions of the world we inhabit,

MANDEEP SINGH	that will answer irrefutably

MANDEEP SINGH	the question that has confounded mankind

MANDEEP SINGH	since the dawn of time;

MANDEEP SINGH	Is there life after death?

CHARLES	No.

RUTH	There she is.

MADAME ARCATI	From the Great Pyramid of Cholula in the west

MADAME ARCATI	to Mount Taishan in the east,

MADAME ARCATI	from Whanganui-a-Tara in the south

MADAME ARCATI	to Uppsala in the north,

MADAME ARCATI	I have travelled the globe,

MADAME ARCATI	communing with gurus, swamis and shaman.

MADAME ARCATI	These wise sages have guided me to a deeper dimension

MADAME ARCATI	where finally I experienced an epiphany

MADAME ARCATI	and broke through to the other side.

MADAME ARCATI	I am certain that everyone here

MADAME ARCATI	has sensed the spirits of their departed loved ones,

MADAME ARCATI	and I am certain we all wish we could communicate with them again

MADAME ARCATI	to say the things we never got to say.

CHARLES	I've got it.

MADAME ARCATI	Tonight...

CHARLES	Sorry.

MADAME ARCATI	...I will use the precious mystical gift

MADAME ARCATI	to make that possible.

MANDEEP SINGH	Bugger!

MAN	Madame Arcati.

EDNA	It's a conjuring trick. I told you. She's a fraud.

MADAME ARCATI	That's an outrageous accusation.

MADAME ARCATI	I merely lost contact.

DR BRADMAN	Charles was right, it was all a put-up job.

DR BRADMAN	Where'd he go?

MANDEEP SINGH	Please, please.

MANDEEP SINGH	Madame Arcati has just been through a very traumatic experience.

MANDEEP SINGH	Please just... Please.

MANDEEP SINGH	Look, I would ask you to respect her privacy at this difficult time.

MANDEEP SINGH	Oh, my giddy aunt!

MADAME ARCATI	I've told you, Mandeep, I don't want to see a living soul.

CHARLES	My name is Charles Condomine. I'm an award-winning writer.

MADAME ARCATI	And especially not the gutter press.

CHARLES	I'm not a reporter. I write crime novels, and screenplays.

MADAME ARCATI	Well, I can't abide fiction or fantasy.

CHARLES	Madame Arcati?

CHARLES	I'm not here to question your integrity.

CHARLES	Faking an exotic accent doesn't mean your gift isn't real.

CHARLES	I fully understand that, like me,

CHARLES	you occasionally have to employ a certain artistic licence

CHARLES	to entertain the masses.

MADAME ARCATI	They expect me to deliver a spectacle,

MADAME ARCATI	a transcendental miracle, night after night.

CHARLES	Of course. There's no need to justify yourself.

CHARLES	I'm a believer.

CHARLES	I'm simply here to invite you to conduct a private seance at my home.

MADAME ARCATI	I'm not a travelling banjo player, Mr Condomine.

MADAME ARCATI	I don't do requests.

CHARLES	Well, there might be some influential guests attending.

CHARLES	Could be the perfect opportunity to fend off any bad publicity

CHARLES	from tonight's unfortunate events.

MADAME ARCATI	When were you wishing this to take place?

CHARLES	As soon as possible.

MADAME ARCATI	Then I suggest this Thursday, midsummer night, the solstice.

MADAME ARCATI	The sacred turning point of the seasons.

CHARLES	Perfect.

CHARLES	I told her how profoundly interested I was

CHARLES	in anything to do with the occult, and she blossomed like a rose.

RUTH	Well, hosting an evening with a professional charlatan

RUTH	sounds like an absolute scream.

CHARLES	Doesn't it?

RUTH	But will it get you closer to finishing your screenplay?

CHARLES	Well, I need the old girl to show me a few tricks of the trade.

CHARLES	That's what's gonna make my new hero truly unique.

RUTH	What's so unique about him?

CHARLES	He's dead.

RUTH	Dead?

CHARLES	As a doornail.

CHARLES	He's the victim of a vicious unsolved murder

CHARLES	and communicates with the living through a medium

CHARLES	who helps bring people back from beyond the grave.

RUTH	Maybe she can resurrect your career at the same time.

RUTH	Daddy's on the warpath.

RUTH	He's threatened to find another writer if you don't deliver soon.

MADAME ARCATI	Is anybody there?

MADAME ARCATI	Is anybody there?

MADAME ARCATI	One rap for yes, two raps for no.

MADAME ARCATI	Is that you, Maia?

RUTH	Who's Maia?

MADAME ARCATI	My spirit guide. She was Tutankhamun's wet nurse.

DR BRADMAN	I do hope she's not still lactating.

MADAME ARCATI	I would ask you not to be flippant, Dr Bradman.

MADAME ARCATI	She may be in Shamballa, but the woman still has feelings.

DR BRADMAN	Please forgive me, Madame Arcati. I didn't mean to cause offence.

MADAME ARCATI	Now we're getting somewhere.

MADAME ARCATI	Is it me you wish to speak to?

MADAME ARCATI	Is it Dr Bradman? Or perhaps one of his less fortunate patients?

MADAME ARCATI	Mrs Bradman?

MADAME ARCATI	Mrs Condomine?

MADAME ARCATI	Behave yourself, Maia.

MADAME ARCATI	Mr Condomine?

MADAME ARCATI	It appears that someone wishes to speak to you, Mr Condomine.

MADAME ARCATI	Do you know anyone who has recently passed over to the other side?

CHARLES	Only my old literary agent, but it's unlikely he'd make contact.

CHARLES	He died owing me a fortune in royalties.

MADAME ARCATI	Are you Mr Condomine's literary agent?

MADAME ARCATI	No. I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

MADAME ARCATI	Is there anyone on the other side you think of often?

MADAME ARCATI	Oh, well, there's nothing for it. I shall have to go into a trance.

MADAME ARCATI	This is the moment I hate.

RUTH	Are you nervous, or...?

MADAME ARCATI	When I was a child, I used to be sick.

MADAME ARCATI	Now, let's see. What have we here?

MADAME ARCATI	Brahms. No, that's too dark and depressing.

MADAME ARCATI	Rachmaninoff. No, too florid.

MADAME ARCATI	This is better. Always.

CHARLES	Does it have to be that song?

MADAME ARCATI	Well, Maia likes a tune she can hum along to.

MADAME ARCATI	Always.

CHARLES	Crikey.

CHARLES	What the devil's going on?

DR BRADMAN	Must be a power cut.

RUTH	Madame Arcati? Madame Arcati, can you hear me?

MRS BRADMAN	Is she breathing?

RUTH	She's having some sort of fit.

RUTH	Please, do something, Dr Bradman.

RUTH	Thank goodness.

MADAME ARCATI	What happened?

CHARLES	Apart from the French windows blowing open, nothing supernatural.

MADAME ARCATI	Something substantial took place.


MADAME ARCATI	I can feel it in my base chakra.

DR BRADMAN	Probably trapped wind.

MADAME ARCATI	No poltergeists, at any rate.

MADAME ARCATI	Any apparitions?

RUTH	Not that we saw.

MADAME ARCATI	What about ectoplasm?

MRS BRADMAN	I'm not quite sure what that is.

MADAME ARCATI	A supernatural viscous substance

MADAME ARCATI	that exudes from the body of one in a spiritualistic trance

MADAME ARCATI	and forms the material for the manifestation of spirits.

MRS BRADMAN	No, I definitely would have remembered that.

MADAME ARCATI	Well, I suppose I should get going before the storm rolls in.

RUTH	Would you care for some refreshments before you return to your hotel?

MADAME ARCATI	No, thank you, Mrs Condomine. I like to travel light.

DR BRADMAN	Congratulations, Madame Arcati. It was a thrilling evening.

MADAME ARCATI	I'm well aware of the irony in your voice, Dr Bradman.

MADAME ARCATI	May I be so bold as to remind you 

MADAME ARCATI	that modern medicine is a recent phenomena

MADAME ARCATI	and that physicians have found value

MADAME ARCATI	in scientifically inexplicable practices

MADAME ARCATI	since the beginning of civilisation.

DR BRADMAN	Quite so.

MADAME ARCATI	Well, good night, everyone.

MADAME ARCATI	I'm sorry so little eventuated.

MADAME ARCATI	Probably something to do with the cosmic flux.

CHARLES	Thank you so much for agreeing to do this, Madame Arcati.

CHARLES	It's been an education on so many levels.

CHARLES	She might hear us.

RUTH	I can't. Really, I can't.

NARRATIVE TITLE	THE WOLDEN ACRE HOTEL

NARRATIVE TITLE	TALISMANS AND AMULETS

MADAME ARCATI	I can't quite put my finger on it, Donald.

MADAME ARCATI	I've never experienced anything like it in my life.

MADAME ARCATI	It genuinely felt as if something tremendous had happened.

MADAME ARCATI	Oh, well, maybe next time.

MADAME ARCATI	Good night, my love.

RUTH	Did you get everything you need for your screenplay?

CHARLES	Everything and more.

RUTH	You're not thinking of turning in for the night, are you?

CHARLES	What?

RUTH	Wouldn't it be prudent to get down the ideas whilst they're still fresh?

CHARLES	Yes, no, absolutely. I shall fix myself a drink and dig in.

RUTH	Carpe diem, darling.

CHARLES	Carpe diem.

NARRATIVE TITLE	MODERN WOMAN

CHARLES	Jesus Christ.

ELVIRA	Charles?

ELVIRA	What on earth have you done?

ELVIRA	The room looks like a giant peach melba.

ELVIRA	And where's my Italian chandelier gone?

CHARLES	What?

CHARLES	Oh, God.

ELVIRA	Hello.

ELVIRA	Please tell me you haven't ruined the rest of the house.

CHARLES	No.

ELVIRA	My Moroccan mosaics.

ELVIRA	Charles.

ELVIRA	One weekend away

ELVIRA	and the whole place has had the life and soul sucked out of it.

CHARLES	This can't be happening. I must be hallucinating.

ELVIRA	Well, judging from the decor,

ELVIRA	I would say that's the understatement of the century.

ELVIRA	I should have known this wasn't down to you.

ELVIRA	Who is she?

CHARLES	It's not what you think.

ELVIRA	Please do not humiliate either one of us any further.

ELVIRA	If you've got something to tell me, be a man and spit it out.

CHARLES	Elvira… You're dead.

ELVIRA	How dare you.

ELVIRA	The last thing I remember

ELVIRA	is competing in the South Downs point-to-point.

CHARLES	That's right, and the conditions were treacherous,

CHARLES	and, as with most things, you refused to listen to reason.

ELVIRA	I couldn't miss the most prestigious meet of the season, Charles.

CHARLES	You paid the ultimate price for your folly and fell at the final fence,

CHARLES	instantly breaking your neck.

CHARLES	The whole episode was very distressing for everyone involved.

ELVIRA	Well, presumably not as distressing as it was for me.

CHARLES	They did rename the jump in your honour.

ELVIRA	How thoughtful.

ELVIRA	I don't understand. If I'm dead, then how and why am I here?

CHARLES	I have absolutely no idea.

CHARLES	Maybe you're a ghost?

ELVIRA	What? No!

CHARLES	Please, don't get hysterical.

RUTH	Hysterical?

RUTH	Concerned more like.

RUTH	Procrastination is the thief of time, Charles, and yours is running out.

ELVIRA	Who's she?

CHARLES	My wife, Ruth.

RUTH	Yes? Are you alright?

ELVIRA	I'm your wife.

CHARLES	Not any more.

RUTH	Why? What's the matter?

CHARLES	Ruth, I'm not speaking to you.

CHARLES	I'm talking to Elvira.

RUTH	Elvira?

CHARLES	Yeah, surely you can see her.

CHARLES	She's standing right next to you.

RUTH	Charles, what are you playing at?

RUTH	Elvira's dead.

ELVIRA	Why does everyone have to keep saying that?

CHARLES	Elvira, darling, this is Ruth. Ruth, darling, this is Elvira.

RUTH	Are you drunk?

CHARLES	Ruth, Elvira is here with us in the room.

CHARLES	Madame Arcati must have summoned her up during the seance.

RUTH	Madame Arcati's a fraud. You said so yourself.
 
RUTH	I'm going to bed, and I suggest that you retire too.

ELVIRA	Finally some time to ourselves so we can get reacquainted.

CHARLES	That's a thoroughly immoral suggestion.

RUTH	I wasn't for a moment insinuating we share a bed.

CHARLES	No...

RUTH	I've come to terms with your recent inability

RUTH	to perform in that department.

ELVIRA	I can't imagine you ever did with that sourpuss.

CHARLES	Be quiet. You're behaving like a guttersnipe.

RUTH	It is your behaviour, Charles, that is unpardonable.

RUTH	Good night.

ELVIRA	Hooray.

ELVIRA	What a frightful woman.

ELVIRA	I can only assume it was a marriage of convenience?

CHARLES	I've gone mad. That's what it is.

CHARLES	Stark raving mad.

RUTH	It will ruin your life if you allow it to get hold of you.

CHARLES	Once and for all, Ruth, last night had nothing to do with alcohol.

CHARLES	I wasn't in the least drunk.

CHARLES	Something very peculiar happened to me.

CHARLES	A one-off psychic delusion, likely brought on by work pressure.

RUTH	A deadline doesn't explain why

RUTH	when I calmly suggested that you should return to bed,

RUTH	you said with the most disgusting leer

RUTH	that it was an immoral suggestion.

CHARLES	I thought I was talking to Elvira.

RUTH	Well, if you were, I can only say

RUTH	it conjures up a fragrant picture of your first marriage.

CHARLES	My first marriage was perfectly charming.

CHARLES	And it's in the worst possible taste for you to sneer at it.

RUTH	I'm not nearly so interested in your first marriage as you think I am.

RUTH	In fact, it's your second marriage that's absorbing me at the moment.

RUTH	It's headed for the rocks.

DR BRADMAN	Well, it's 155 over 99. It is quite high.

CHARLES	I'm not surprised, given the intensity of the hallucination.

CHARLES	I genuinely believed Elvira was in the room talking to me.

CHARLES	She was as real as you or I.

DR BRADMAN	Probably best you stop taking the tablets, old chap.

CHARLES	Darling.

CHARLES	I hate to see you so upset.

CHARLES	Please accept my heartfelt apology

CHARLES	for anything untoward I might have said last night.

CHARLES	Or this morning.

RUTH	Apology accepted.

RUTH	Let's never mention it again.

RUTH	How are you feeling?

CHARLES	I believe Dr Bradman might have solved the riddle.

RUTH	Well, thank goodness.

CHARLES	Now, let's go and see your father.

CHARLES	I want to check he likes my new idea before committing it to the page.

CHARLES	I do not want to be late.

NARRATIVE TITLE	THE RANK ORGANISATION PINEWOOD STUDIOS

RUTH	Charles?

CHARLES	And so, you see, Henry,it's only through the medium

CHARLES	that the killer can be brought to justice,

CHARLES	based on new evidence that he gathers from beyond the grave.

HENRY	I like the premise, Charles,

HENRY	but not enough to waitanother six months to see a script.

RUTH	Charles will deliver in a few weeks,Daddy. You have my word.

CHARLES	And mine.

HITCHCOCK	Cut!

HENRY	Right, come on,let's go and watch the next scene.

HENRY	I think Hitch will bethe perfect director for our film.

HENRY	Just don't get under his feet.

HENRY	Come on, darling.

HENRY	Googie, darling, how lovelyto see you. Charles Condomine.

GOOGIE WITHERS	I'm a big fan of your books,Mr Condomine.

GOOGIE WITHERS	When can we expect Detective Flowersto crack his next case?

RUTH	Charles has actually made the leap into screenwriting.

RUTH	With Daddy's help.

GOOGIE WITHERS	How exciting.

GOOGIE WITHERS	I'd die to play one of your strong-willed female characters.

GOOGIE WITHERS	Where do you drawyour inspiration from?

RUTH	Where do you think?

GOOGIE WITHERS	How romantic, to marry your muse.

ELVIRA	Not so romantic to replace her.

ELVIRA	Why don't you tell her the truth, Charles.

ELVIRA	That you're an astral bigamist?

CHARLES	Be quiet. Stop behaving like a harlot.

GOOGIE WITHERS	I beg your pardon?

ELVIRA	Admit it, Charles. All of your female characters are based on me.

CHARLES	You always were vain and self-obsessed.

HENRY	How dare you speak to my leading lady like that?

CHARLES	No.

RUTH	Get a grip, Charles. What on earth is going on?

CHARLES	Elvira is here.

CHARLES	I can see her.

CHARLES	She's right there.

RUTH	I insist you go home immediately and lie down.

CHARLES	I have no desire to go to bed in the middle of the afternoon.

ELVIRA	My, how things have changed.

ELVIRA	I remember a time when we could barely drag ourselves

ELVIRA	out of our double divan.

CHARLES	Stop being indecent. Get out of my sight.

HENRY	How dare you speak to my daughter like that!

CHARLES	No, I wasn't speaking to her.

HENRY	Get off my set.

ELVIRA	You're in trouble now.

CHARLES	Don't be so infantile.

HENRY	I'll give you infantile.

RUTH	Does it hurt?

CHARLES	Only if I breathe.

RUTH	Let me see it, darling.

RUTH	What about now?

CHARLES	Oh, God!

RUTH	I suggest you take yourself to your study.

RUTH	The only way my father will forgive you

RUTH	is if you deliver an Oscar-worthy script.

CHARLES	How am I supposed to write in this state?

RUTH	Well, you'd better try.

RUTH	Either start typing and prove you're not barking mad

RUTH	or I'll be forced to call Dr Bradman

RUTH	and have you referredto a nerve specialist.

CHARLES	Ruth, I'm not in the least neurotic

CHARLES	and never have been.

RUTH	Well, psycho-analyst, then. 

CHARLES	I refuse to endure months of expensive humiliation

CHARLES	only to be told at the end of it

CHARLES	that at the age of four I was in love with my rocking horse.

RUTH	Don't take that flippant tone with me, Charles Condomine.

RUTH	I'm not the one who's started seeing things.

CHARLES	So you do believe me, then?

RUTH	Of course I don't.

RUTH	There's no such thingas ghosts or ghouls.

MADAME ARCATI	I call upon Donald Keeling,

MADAME ARCATI	Second Lieutenant

MADAME ARCATI	in the 92nd Regiment of Gordon Highlanders,

MADAME ARCATI	who died on February the 27th, 1881,

MADAME ARCATI	at the Battle of Mujuba Hill.

MADAME ARCATI	Come forth and make yourself known to me, 

MADAME ARCATI	Cecily, your ever devoted wife.

MADAME ARCATI	Donald.

MADAME ARCATI	Is that you?

HOTEL EMPLOYEE	It's housekeeping. Do you need fresh towels?

CHARLES	What are you doing here?

ELVIRA	Despite removing every trace of me, this is still my home.

ELVIRA	Besides, I have no idea how to get back even if I wanted to.

CHARLES	Are you saying you're staying indefinitely?

ELVIRA	Why? Would you hate it so much if I did?

ELVIRA	Honestly, Charles, I really am a little hurt.

ELVIRA	You're the only one who could have called me back.

CHARLES	I most emphatically did not send for you, Elvira.

CHARLES	Ruth and I are about to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary together.

ELVIRA	Five? What is that, leather?

CHARLES	Wood.

ELVIRA	Watch out for the splinters.

EDITH	Mrs Condomine.

RUTH	I'll call Dr Bradman, see if he'll accompany us to the sanatorium.

CHARLES	Ruth, please, listen to me. I haven't gone mad.

CHARLES	The ghost of my first wife, Elvira, has crossed over from the other side

CHARLES	and is here in the room with us right now.

RUTH	Yes, dear, I know, I see her perfectly well,

RUTH	along with the zebras and chimpanzees hiding under the piano.

CHARLES	Ruth, I have always looked upon you

CHARLES	as a woman of perception and understanding. 

RUTH	I am, but if you say you're not drinking,

RUTH	there must be something pressing on your brain.

CHARLES	Elvira, do something to reveal that you really are here, please.

CHARLES	She's going to have me committed.

ELVIRA	Do you remember when we first heard our song, Charles?

ELVIRA SINGS:	I'll be loving you Always

CHARLES	See? What did I tell you?

RUTH	It's a cruel trick, Charles,

RUTH	using some sort of autosuggestion or hypnotism to scare me.

CHARLES	It isn't. I swear it isn't. Darling.

CHARLES	Darling. Elvira, do something else,for God's sake.

ELVIRA	Anything to oblige.

CHARLES	Look.

RUTH	Lord.

ELVIRA	Adios, interloper.

ELVIRA	Oops.

NARRATIVE TITLE	FRAUDULENT MEDIUM EXPOSED

MAN	I'm afraid we need the room back.

MADAME ARCATI	I told you, I'll be packed and ready to go within an hour.

RUTH	Thank God I caught you.

RUTH	You are my only hope. Something terrible has taken place.

MADAME ARCATI	You've heard strange noises in the night?

MADAME ARCATI	Boards creaking? Doors slamming?

MADAME ARCATI	A subdued moaning in the passages?

RUTH	No, none of those.

RUTH	But it appears that after the seance, 

RUTH	my husband's first wife, Elvira,

RUTH	who died seven years ago, is back among us.

MADAME ARCATI	At last.

MADAME ARCATI	A genuine materialisation.

MADAME ARCATI	I knew something stupendous had happened to me that night.

MADAME ARCATI	I felt it in my spinal cortex.

MADAME ARCATI	After all these years of spiritual devotion,

MADAME ARCATI	I've finally been rewarded.

RUTH	I appreciate the pride in your achievement,

RUTH	but I would like to point out

RUTH	it's making my position in my home untenable,

RUTH	and I hold you entirely responsible.

MADAME ARCATI	Forgive me, Mrs Condomine. I'm being abominably selfish.

MADAME ARCATI	Just to let me get this clear in my mind,

MADAME ARCATI	you yourself have not seen this manifestation?

RUTH	No, but Charles claims he can see and talk to her.

MADAME ARCATI	If the emotional connection is strong, that is sometimes possible.

RUTH	What?

MADAME ARCATI	It can sometimes develop into a level ten,

MADAME ARCATI	something I've never even dared dream of.

MADAME ARCATI	Can he, by any chance, touch her?

RUTH	I sincerely hope not.

RUTH	Why? Can that happen?
 
MADAME ARCATI	If the returning spirit feels welcome,

MADAME ARCATI	it can gradually become physically substantial.

CHARLES	Thank you, Mrs Bradman. Well, please do let me know if you hear from her.

CHARLES	She's not there either.

ELVIRA	I remember when you couldn't wait to spend an afternoon alone with me.

CHARLES	Please refrain from playing with my affections.

CHARLES	I feel strange enough.

ELVIRA	So you do still find me attractive?

CHARLES	Elvira, please.

CHARLES	This isn't appropriate.

ELVIRA	Look into my eyes

ELVIRA	and tell me you don't love me anymore.

CHARLES	I shall always love the memory of you.

ELVIRA	Memories are about the past, Charles,

ELVIRA	but I'm here, and this is the present.

ELVIRA	Why don't we take the boat out like we used to and get some air?

CHARLES	I can't. I'm on a deadline.

ELVIRA	What are you writing? Cheques?

CHARLES	I'll have you know, I've been commissioned

CHARLES	to adapt my first novel for the screen.

ELVIRA	Your first novel?

CHARLES	I nearly wore my fingers to the bone committing this story to the page.

ELVIRA	Let's face it, darling, it's not a coincidence 

ELVIRA	that you haven't published a word since my demise.

CHARLES	I won't deny, you did have a certain flair for plot.

CHARLES	And character.

ELVIRA	And...?

CHARLES	And dialogue.

ELVIRA	Right.

ELVIRA	The biggest problem you have is the twist into the third act.

ELVIRA	It isn't dramatic enough,

ELVIRA	which is why you don't have a satisfying climax.

CHARLES	Tell me something I don't know.

ELVIRA	Wouldn't it be smarter to flip the whole thing on its head

ELVIRA	and reveal the husband as the killer?

CHARLES	That's good.

ELVIRA	Or what would be more interesting is if it's the wife who set him up.

CHARLES	Why would the wife send her husband to the gallows?

ELVIRA	It's obvious, darling.

ELVIRA	Susan Rutherford becomes the prime suspect

ELVIRA	when her alibi fails to materialise,

ELVIRA	and we naturally assume

ELVIRA	that she's trying to protect the reputation of the foreign secretary

ELVIRA	whose aspirations of becoming the prime minister

ELVIRA	would be severely compromised if it was revealed

ELVIRA	that he was having an affair.

ELVIRA	But, in reality, nothing could be further from the truth,

ELVIRA	which is what we learn from the victim himself,

ELVIRA	and it's only through the medium that they can work it out.

CHARLES	Work what out?

ELVIRA	That she's pregnant with the dead foreign secretary's child.

CHARLES	That's good.

CHARLES	Well, even I didn't see that one coming.

ELVIRA	Of course you didn't, darling. You're just the writer.

MADAME ARCATI	I'm afraid, Mrs Condomine, that the time has come

MADAME ARCATI	for me to admit quite frankly

MADAME ARCATI	I haven't the foggiest idea how to send her back.

MADAME ARCATI	I had my own personal reasons

MADAME ARCATI	for wishing to communicate with the departed,

MADAME ARCATI	but I never for a moment considered the possibility

MADAME ARCATI	of having to send someone back.

RUTH	Well, I suggest that you find a way.

RUTH	I refuse to share my husband with anyone,

RUTH	especially his dead ex-wife.

MADAME ARCATI	Well, if I had thought for a moment that your husband wished

MADAME ARCATI	to get in touch with the spirit of his dead ex-wife,

MADAME ARCATI	I would, of course, have consulted you first.

MADAME ARCATI	After all, noblesse oblige.

RUTH	He had no intention of getting in touch with her, I can assure you.

RUTH	The whole thing was planned in order for him to get material

RUTH	for his new project.

MADAME ARCATI	Am I to understand I was invited in the spirit of mockery?

RUTH	He merely wanted to make some notes of the tricks of the trade.

MADAME ARCATI	Tricks of the trade? I've never been so insulted in my life.

RUTH	I'm sorry if that all came out wrong.

RUTH	I'm rather overwrought with the whole affair.

RUTH	Please, I implore you to help us.

MADAME ARCATI	I will go to the Spiritual Alliance on my way back to Sussex

MADAME ARCATI	and ask them for guidance.

RUTH	Sussex? You can't abandon us in our hour of need.

MADAME ARCATI	Well, due to my recent circumstances, I can no longer afford to stay here,

MADAME ARCATI	but you can contact me.

RUTH	I can cover your hotel bill, and any expenses,

RUTH	till this terrifying ordeal has been resolved.

ELVIRA	Susan Rutherford leans over the foreign secretary.

CHARLES	Don't stop.

ELVIRA	The Soviet Union can wait.'

ELVIRA	Says the foreign secretary. He turns and looks at Susan longingly.

ELVIRA	'This can't,' he whispers urgently.

ELVIRA	And then he starts to slowly

ELVIRA	unbutton her silk blouse,

ELVIRA	as they start to passionately kiss.

ELVIRA	I'm tired, and I'm thirsty,

ELVIRA	and I want go to into town and drink Negronis like we used to.

CHARLES	But it's getting late.

ELVIRA	You really have got a little too comfortable

ELVIRA	in your slippers, Charles.

NARRATIVE TITLE	SAVOY

CHARLES	What do you want, Elvira?

ELVIRA	Want? I don't know what you mean.

CHARLES	I remember whenever you were overwhelmingly demure,

CHARLES	it usually meant that you wanted something.

ELVIRA	It's horrid of you to be so suspicious.

ELVIRA	All I want is to be alone with you.

CHARLES	I can't deny, I do feel rather peculiar seeing you again.

ELVIRA	I've missed you more than life itself.

CHARLES	I've missed you too.

CHARLES	My American dream.

CHARLES	I was utterly heartbroken after the accident.

CHARLES	Truth is, I don't believe I ever really got over losing you.

ELVIRA	Do you love Ruth?

CHARLES	Of course I do.

ELVIRA	As much as you loved me?

CHARLES	Don't be silly.

CHARLES	It's entirely different.

ELVIRA	I'm so glad.

ELVIRA	Nothing could have ever been quite the same, could it?

ELVIRA	Let's go to Soho.

ELVIRA	Swap those slippers for some dancing shoes?

CHARLES	Slow down!

CHARLES	I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh, God…

RUTH	Charles!

ELVIRA	I love being back behind the wheel of a car.

CHARLES	Can't say the feeling's mutual.

RUTH	Charles, where on earth have you been? I've been worried sick.

ELVIRA	It’s too bad it's not terminal.

CHARLES	I wanted to clear my head, so I took a long drive.

RUTH	In the passenger seat?

CHARLES	Look, let's not quarrel when we should be celebrating.

CHARLES	I finished the first act of my screenplay, and it's rather good.

ELVIRA	My screenplay, more like.

RUTH	How did you manage that in a day?

CHARLES	Elvira helped me.

RUTH	Do you mean to tell me

RUTH	that not only has she bullied her way back over the threshold,

RUTH	she's trying to work with you now as well?

ELVIRA	What do you mean, trying? I've written 15 books in your name.

CHARLES	Elvira, this is neither the time nor the place.

RUTH	This is intolerable.

RUTH	Elvira, now, you listen to me.

CHARLES	Darling...

RUTH	I... Yes?

CHARLES	She's over there.

RUTH	Right.

RUTH	Now, listen here, Elvira.

RUTH	I've been to see Madame Arcati and she's going to send you back

RUTH	to wherever it is she regrettably dragged you from.

ELVIRA	Charles?

CHARLES	Don't.

CHARLES	Darling, please don't be upset.

RUTH	Upset? You've just spent the night with your ex-wife.

RUTH	How do you expect me to feel?

CHARLES	Ecstatic.

CHARLES	Our dream of going to Hollywood is finally within our grasp.

CHARLES	As soon as I deliver this screenplay, we'll be crossing the Atlantic

CHARLES	quicker than you can say Sunset Boulevard.

CHARLES	Think of the glitz.

CHARLES	The glamour.

CHARLES	The good times we're gonna share.

CHARLES	You won't be reading about other people's lives any more.

CHARLES	They'll be reading about ours.

RUTH	And you can't do it without her?

CHARLES	Of course I can.

CHARLES	It'll just be a lot quicker this way.

CHARLES	There's really no need for you to be jealous.

CHARLES	You're the one I love.

CHARLES	Forgive me that I don't tell you enough.

CHARLES	Now that the words are flowing, I feel unblocked in other areas too.

RUTH	Promise me you can't touch her.

CHARLES	Darling, she's a ghost.

CHARLES	And, besides, the only woman I want to touch is you.

ELVIRA	Listen here, lady.

ELVIRA	You may have summoned me into this world,

ELVIRA	but there is no way I'm going to let you send me back again.

ELVIRA	I'm here to stay. Is that clear?

ELVIRA	How dare you ignore me, you meddling old crone.

ELVIRA	Either you leave me in peace to live my life,

ELVIRA	or I'll haunt you until the day you die.

MADAME ARCATI	The Tower.

MADAME ARCATI	Symbol of chaos,

MADAME ARCATI	destruction and devastation.

ELVIRA	Wakey-wakey. Rise and shine.

ELVIRA	What was I, Charles? The warm-up act?

ELVIRA	If I was you, I'd keep it there.

EDITH	Good afternoon, ma'am.

RUTH	I'm going to have to correct you, Edith.

RUTH	It's not a good afternoon. It's a glorious one.

EDITH	Shall I prepare lunch?

RUTH	Yes, please. You read my mind.

RUTH	I'm absolutely famished. I'll have a cheese and pickle platter.

RUTH	With extra pickle.

EDITH	Yes, ma'am.

RUTH	What happened to your leg?

EDITH	I slipped down the staircase.

RUTH	You really must refrain from doing everything at the double.

RUTH	You're not in the navy, you know.

EDITH	I wasn't hurrying, ma'am.

EDITH	There was axle grease smeared all over the top step.

HENRY	Yes, her agent loves the pitch,

HENRY	thinks it would be a perfect vehicle for her.

CHARLES	Seriously? Greta Garbo?

HENRY	Yes.

CHARLES	Mata Hari speaking my words would be a dream come true.

HENRY	Charles, are you still on track?

CHARLES	Yes, absolutely still on track.

CHARLES	I'll send the next ream of pages over as soon I reach the second act turn. HENRY - Don't let me down.

CHARLES	Thank you, Henry.

CHARLES	And I appreciate your continued patience and belief.

HENRY	Splendid.

CHARLES	Goodbye.

CHARLES	Elvira, what are you doing?

ELVIRA	Greta Garbo speaking my words?

CHARLES	Darling, what am I supposed say? That I've got a ghost writer?

CHARLES	Stop it. Elvira, that's one of our wedding gifts.

ELVIRA	Not ours, Charles. Hers.

ELVIRA	You care more about breaking china than you do about breaking my heart.

CHARLES	Elvira, I was unwaveringly loyal and faithful to you

CHARLES	in all our years of marriage.

CHARLES	What was I supposed to do after you died?

CHARLES	Become a recluse and wear a black armband for the rest of my life?

EDITH	Ma'am, the garden judges are here.

RUTH	Thank you, Edith.

RUTH	We've been sabotaged.

NARRATIVE TITLE	THE LONDON SPIRITUAL ALLIANCE 

HARRY PRICE	That is an outrageous suggestion.

HARRY PRICE	As the national director of the Spiritual Alliance,

HARRY PRICE	my job is to protect the reputation of genuine psychic practitioners,

HARRY	not undermine them.

CALLER	I see.

HARRY PRICE	And I vow, along with my friend Harry Houdini,

HARRY PRICE	to investigate and expose

HARRY PRICE	every fraudulent spiritualist operating in this country.

CALLER	Very good, sir.

HARRY PRICE	Come in.

MARGOT	Madame Arcati here to see you, sir.

CALLER	Thank you very much for your time.

HARRY	Yes. Thank you.

HARRY PRICE	Always a pleasure to talk to the press.

CALLER	Goodbye, sir.

HARRY PRICE	Well, you've got a cheek, showing your face while you're suspended.

MADAME ARCATI	I'm sorry to turn up unannounced, but I urgently need your guidance.

MADAME ARCATI	I have pulled off a level-ten manifestation.

HARRY PRICE	And was this before or after

HARRY PRICE	you conned 800 people into paying to see you levitate?

MADAME ARCATI	No, really, you must believe me, Harry.

MADAME ARCATI	And it is possible this presence has a physical form.

HARRY PRICE	Margot, where are the scissors?

MARGOT	Drawer.

HARRY PRICE	So you're telling me that the first level-ten manifestation

HARRY PRICE	reported in over three centuries

HARRY PRICE	was the result of an ordinary common-or-garden seance.

MADAME ARCATI	Yes, that is correct.

HARRY PRICE	What did you use as a guide?

MADAME ARCATI	This. The Art of the Seance.

MADAME ARCATI	Can you help me?

HARRY	Yes, Madame Arcati, I think I can.

HARRY PRICE	Do you have your membership card?

MADAME ARCATI	Membership card...

MADAME ARCATI	Yes.

HARRY PRICE	I'm going to start by terminating your membership

HARRY PRICE	with immediate effect.

HARRY PRICE	This is no place for fantasists or frauds.

HARRY PRICE	Margot.

HARRY PRICE	Madame Arcati's leaving now.

MARGOT	Meet me in Temple Square in an hour.

MARGOT	Chapter four, page nine, paragraph six.

MADAME ARCATI	A banishing spell. Oh, Margot, thank you.

MARGOT	We don't have long.

MARGOT	I need to replace it in the safe before Mr Price returns from lunch.

MADAME ARCATI	It's recorded in ancient Druidic text.

MARGOT	I'm a little rusty, but I'll do my best.

MADAME ARCATI	Wait.

MARGOT	Take Ceridwen's brew of Devil's Claw.

MADAME ARCATI	Devil's Claw.

MARGOT	Poisoned root of Aconite.

MADAME ARCATI	Oh, yes.

MARGOT	Elixir of Vervain flowers.

MADAME ARCATI	Yes, of course, that's the enchanter's plant.

MARGOT	The sacrificial offering is at its strongest with a waning moon.

MADAME ARCATI	A waning moon.

MARGOT	Sprinkle black salt on a stone altar.

MADAME ARCATI	Salt.

MARGOT	Then lay the freshly torn bladder of a carnivore.

MADAME ARCATI	The bladder?

MARGOT	Oh, no.

MARGOT	Freshly torn bladderwort

MARGOT	of the carnivorous aquatic Utricularia plant family.

MADAME ARCATI	Thank heaven.

MADAME ARCATI	I thought for a minute I was going to have to get my hands dirty.

MARGOT	Good luck.

MRS BRADMAN	Will you excuse me?

MRS BRADMAN	What about Clark Gable? He'd make a dashing Detective Frank Flowers.

HENRY	Good actor, terrible breath.

HENRY	Very tricky for the leading ladies. I was thinking Cary Grant.

MRS BRADMAN	Now we're talking.

MRS BRADMAN	I look forward to making his acquaintance at the premiere.

HENRY	I'm afraid you're getting ahead of yourself there, Mrs Bradman.

HENRY	Even I can't make a film without a script.

HENRY	Be rather like trying to perform surgery without a patient.

DR BRADMAN	The typewriter can be a cruel and demanding mistress.

HENRY	Yes, well, let's hope that's the only affair Charles is having.

RUTH	Hello, Daddy.

CHARLES	Time for a speech.

CHARLES	Ladies and gentlemen.

CHARLES	As a writer, people are always expecting me

CHARLES	to come up with lots of words.

CHARLES	Well, today I'm sure you'll all be relieved to hear

CHARLES	that I'm going to keep things short and sweet, 

CHARLES	just like my wife.

CHARLES	If I were to create a character as beautiful, as poised,

CHARLES	as perfect as Ruth,

CHARLES	my fans would accuse me of straying into fantasy.

CHARLES	But thankfully we are all here today to celebrate the fact

CHARLES	that Ruth is my reality and has been for five fabulous years.

CHARLES	So, let us be upstanding, upstandingly,

CHARLES	and raise our glasses to true love.

ALL	True love.

RUTH	True love.

CHARLES	True love.

ELVIRA	Never dies.

REVEREND GREEN	Lord Almighty.

CHARLES	Ruth, what on earth are you doing?

RUTH	Cooling off. All that dancing got me hot and sticky!

CHARLES	Everybody's looking.

MRS BRADMAN	I didn't know it was going to be one of those parties.

HENRY	You're as wet as an otter's pocket. What happened to your dress?

RUTH	What happened to yours, Daddy?

RUTH	Everybody!

CHARLES	Yes, that's lovely, darling.

CHARLES	I'm not surethe fish are enjoying this.

CHARLES	Why don't you come upstairs and have a little lie-down?

RUTH	Only if you're going to join me.

RUTH	Make love to me like it was the first time.

RUTH	Does Mr Peasbody want to come out and play?

ELVIRA	Well, I'm not surprised she doesn't like to do it with the lights on.

CHARLES	Don't be so vulgar, Elvira.

RUTH	She's in here?

RUTH	Now, you listen to me, you low-rent hussy.

RUTH	This is my party, my bedroom, my house,

RUTH	and Charles is my husband.

RUTH	What did she say?

CHARLES	She apologised unreservedly and has taken herself back downstairs.

ELVIRA	You should have been an actor, Charles. You really are rather good.

RUTH	I'm sorry, Charles. I'm just... I'm not in the mood any more.

ELVIRA	I am.

RUTH	Morning, darling.

RUTH	You look shattered.

CHARLES	Yes, had a bit of a restless night.

RUTH	Yes, I thought you were thrashing around a bit.

CHARLES	I had Edna prepare Norfolk kippers, your favourite.

RUTH	That's very sweet. I could do with something hearty.

RUTH	I fear I rather overdid it on the bubbles yesterday.

RUTH	The party went by in a bit of a blur.

RUTH	What are you stuck on?

CHARLES	22 down. Greek god of retribution.

CHARLES	Seven letters. Third letter M, seventh letter S.

RUTH	Nemesis.

RUTH	What on earth has happened?

EDITH	She said the place is cursed.

EDNA	Not safe! Not safe at all!

RUTH	Edna?

RUTH	You can't leave us!

EDNA	You can keep your job.

EDNA	I'm getting out of here. Go away!

EDNA	I'm having nothing to do with you. Go away!
RUTH	Stay Edna. Please.

EDNA	You can stick your bleeding job up your bum!

MADAME ARCATI	There you are.

MADAME ARCATI	There you are.

MADAME ARCATI	Now, to work.

MADAME ARCATI	Yes.

MADAME ARCATI	Where are you?

ELVIRA	Detective, I don't see how you can blame a girl

ELVIRA	for falling in love with the right guy for the wrong reasons.

ELVIRA	But what about that poor sap of a husband of yours?

ELVIRA	Guys like him are a dime a dozen.

ELVIRA	What was he, the right guy in the wrong place at the wrong time?

ELVIRA	Detective, just being close to you,

ELVIRA	I feel as if I am completely naked.

ELVIRA	How do you always manage to see right through me?

ELVIRA	I see things just the way they are.

ELVIRA	The rest of the world needs bifocals.

CHARLES	I'm not sure about that last line. It feels too florid.

CHARLES	Need something simple and to the point, like...

CHARLES	'That's my job, sweetie. I just do it.'

ELVIRA	Whatever you prefer. It's your name on the script.

CHARLES	And fade to black.

CHARLES	Well, dare I say, I think the film's gonna be even better than the book.

CHARLES	And we finished ahead of the deadline.

CHARLES	Just wait till I tell Ruth.

ELVIRA	Let's not tell her just yet.

RUTH	For heaven's sake.

RUTH	Fiddlesticks.

RUTH	Damn and blast.

CHARLES	You alright, darling?

RUTH	Knowing you're working your fingers to the bone

RUTH	makes it easier for me to endure a few blisters and burns.

CHARLES	Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls, my dear.

RUTH	I've nothing to serve for lunch, I'm afraid.

CHARLES	Please don't worry about it. I'm not in the least hungry.

RUTH	Dare I ask how it's going over there?

CHARLES	The finishing line is almost in sight.

RUTH	Thank goodness.

RUTH	I don't like you alone with her one iota,

RUTH	but if it means you're going to be able to deliver the damn script,

RUTH	then I can just about tolerate it.

CHARLES	You and I do make a good team, darling.

RUTH	I'd like us to move our beds back together.

RUTH	Permanently.

RUTH	I think if we're going to be separated during the days,

RUTH	the least we could do is spend our nights together as man and wife.

CHARLES	I should like nothing more.

CHARLES	I'm going to take a walk, try to clear my head.

ELVIRA	Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek along here,

ELVIRA	and your reward when you found me?

ELVIRA	Look. Isn't he handsome?

CHARLES	He's magnificent.

ELVIRA	He can sense me.

ELVIRA	How wonderful not to be frightened of the unknown.

ELVIRA	You're not frightened, are you, Charles?

CHARLES	Of what?

ELVIRA	Falling back in love.

CHARLES	How is that possible when we're existing on two different planes?

CHARLES	I'm alive and you're...

ELVIRA	Don't.

ELVIRA	Don't say it.

CHARLES	I'm so sorry, Elvira. There's no easy way to say this.

CHARLES	But I'm struggling to see a future in us.

ELVIRA	You know, Charles, when you give someone an eternity ring,

ELVIRA	it's supposed to be a love that lasts forever.

ELVIRA	Charles?

RUTH	Charles, watch out!

ELVIRA	Damn.

RUTH	She's dangerous, Charles.

RUTH	Edna was almost scalped.

RUTH	It's blindingly obvious that Elvira came here

RUTH	for one purpose and one purpose only.

RUTH	She came here to have you to herself, forever.

CHARLES	How?

RUTH	By killing you off, of course.

CHARLES	That's absurd.

RUTH	Do you really think the cabinet climbed up onto the roof

RUTH	and jumped off of its own accord?

CHARLES	Elvira may be prone to temper tantrums, but she still loves me.

CHARLES	She'd never wish me any harm.

RUTH	If you were dead, it would be her final triumph over me.

RUTH	She'd have you all to herself on her beastly astral plane

RUTH	and I'd be left high and dry.

RUTH	She's probably planning some sort of spiritual remarriage.

CHARLES	What are we gonna do?

RUTH	Yes, the guest's name is Madame Arcati, room 14.

MAN	One moment.

MAN	I'm sorry, but she left yesterday.

RUTH	I see. Did she leave any messages?

MAN	I'm afraid not.

RUTH	Thank you.

RUTH	She checked out yesterday.

CHARLES	Well, there's nothing for it. I shall have to get myself arrested.

CHARLES	Spend the night locked up in the cells.

RUTH	No. We just have to create our own safe place for the night.

CHARLES	Right.

MADAME ARCATI	Now, gently does it.

MADAME ARCATI	Precious.

MADAME ARCATI	Herba veneris.

MADAME ARCATI	Nature's divine protector.

CHARLES	What are you doing with that?

CHARLES	I've just removed all the heavy and sharp objects for a reason.

RUTH	I thought you could keep going with your script

RUTH	while we're holed up in here.

CHARLES	I've already finished it.

RUTH	Well, I thought you said you were struggling.

CHARLES	On reflection, I think I was overthinking the whole thing.

CHARLES	I'll give the manuscript a quick read 

CHARLES	and drive it over to the studio first thing in the morning.

RUTH	Oh, Charles, what wonderful news.

RUTH	Daddy's gonna be over the moon.

RUTH	As am I.

CHARLES	Thank you, darling.


RUTH	Now we can both focus on banishing Elvira into oblivion

RUTH	once and for all.

CHARLES	Not a moment too soon. Two's company.

CHARLES	Three's a nightmare.

MADAME ARCATI	Nearly there.

MADAME ARCATI	Vervain and dill hinder witches from their will.

RUTH	Charles.

RUTH	Charles.

RUTH	Hello?

MADAME ARCATI	 Mrs Condomine, I have news.

MADAME ARCATI	Doors are opening and change is in the air.

RUTH	This is no time for riddles, Madame Arcati.

RUTH	We've been urgently trying to contact you.

RUTH	Charles's life is in grave danger. Elvira is trying to murder him.

MADAME ARCATI	I feared she might become a malevolent spirit.

RUTH	That's putting it mildly. Where are you?

MADAME ARCATI	In Sussex. I've gathered everything together and now I'm ready.

RUTH	For what?

MADAME ARCATI	Well, to send her back, of course.

RUTH	Stay put, Madame Arcati. I'll come and collect you.

EDITH	The telephone woke me. Apologies if I scared you.

RUTH	When Mr Condomine wakes up,

RUTH	tell him I've gone to fetch Madame Arcati and I shall be back before lunch.

EDITH	Madame Arcati... before...

CHARLES	Don't hurt me, I beg you.

EDITH	Are you alright in there, Mr Condomine?

CHARLES	I've never stopped loving you.

EDITH	I don't know what to say, sir.

ELVIRA	You have a funny way of showing it, Charles.

CHARLES	I was gonna put your name on the manuscript

CHARLES	before I delivered it this morning, I promise.

EDITH	That won't be necessary, sir.

ELVIRA	I'm a woman, Charles.

ELVIRA	We're used to not getting the credit we deserve.

CHARLES	No, I insist. I'll get changed and leave straightaway.

EDITH	Mrs Condomine left in the car a while ago.

EDITH	She said she would be back by lunchtime.

CHARLES	Elvira, what have you done?

ELVIRA	Oops.

MADAME ARCATI	Mr Condomine, I would just like to say that I reproach myself bitterly.

CHARLES	You are not to blame, Madame Arcati.

CHARLES	The fault lies squarely on my shoulders.

CHARLES	It was my ambition and ego that dragged us into this unbearable mess,

CHARLES	and that's something I shall have to live with for the rest of my life.

MADAME ARCATI	The last time I spoke with Mrs Condomine, your life was in danger.

MADAME ARCATI	I urge you to come and see me at your earliest possible convenience.

MADAME ARCATI	Here is my card. I'll be waiting.

CHARLES	You're not going to stayfor refreshments?

MADAME ARCATI	Please, don't think me rude,

MADAME ARCATI	but I prefer to contemplate the passing of a spirit

MADAME ARCATI	in my own private way.

MADAME ARCATI	My sincerest condolences, Mr Condomine.

ELVIRA	Shouldn't that be congratulations?

CHARLES	What the hell are you doing here? Have you no shame?

ELVIRA	It was an accident, Charles. I was trying to kill you.

CHARLES	How can you be so heartless?

ELVIRA	Death does that to you.

ELVIRA	You know, you can always tell how well regarded someone is

ELVIRA	by the attendance at their funeral.

CHARLES	What's that supposed to mean?

ELVIRA	Bit of a poor turnout today if you ask me.

ELVIRA	I barely counted 40 people.

CHARLES	That does it.

CHARLES	Come here!

ELVIRA	Just like old times, Charles! With you chasing me round the garden!

CHARLES	Only today there's going to be a different outcome!

MRS BRADMAN	Will you excuse me?

MRS BRADMAN	I'm sorry for your loss, Mr Mackintosh.

MRS BRADMAN	Ruth was a fine woman, and a good friend.

MRS BRADMAN	I'm going to miss her deeply.

HENRY	Thank you, Mrs Bradman.

HENRY	I know she was fond of you too.

HENRY	I can't quite believe she's gone.

MRS BRADMAN	My mother always said that time is a physician that heals every grief.

ELVIRA	You never were much of an opponent on the croquet lawn, Charles.

CHARLES	You repulse me.

CHARLES	I'm going to kill you.

ELVIRA	Don't be an imbecile. I'm already dead.

HENRY	You'd better fetch your medicinal bag before someone else gets killed.

EDITH	Edna was right. This place is cursed.

CHARLES	I can't bear to see you ever again.

ELVIRA	The feeling's mutual, Charles.

ELVIRA	With age and disappointment, you've become a pompous ass.

DR BRADMAN	Charles.

DR BRADMAN	Everything's gonna be splendid.

CHARLES	Not while she's here, it won't.

DR BRADMAN	Not while who's here?

CHARLES	Elvira!

CHARLES	Where am I?

ELVIRA	In the loony bin.

CHARLES	What?

ELVIRA	There's no point in struggling, Charles.

ELVIRA	The more you thrash around, the longer they'll keep you in.

CHARLES	Why am I here?

ELVIRA	You've been sectioned under the Mental Treatment Act

ELVIRA	and held under mandatory observation for the next 28 days.

CHARLES	I hope you rot in hell.

ELVIRA	It's not wise to be bad-tempered with the only person who can help you.

CHARLES	I'd rather eat my own tongue than ask you for help.

ELVIRA	You might just get to do that.

ELVIRA	Dr McEwan is planning on taking you down the corridor in 15 minutes

ELVIRA	for electric shock treatment.

CHARLES	What?

CHARLES	No! No, come back. Wait.

ELVIRA	Of course, there's usually a way around these things.

CHARLES	What do you want from me?

ELVIRA	I know you're never going to forgive me, Charles,

ELVIRA	and being stuck in purgatory with you grieving over another woman

ELVIRA	is a fate worse than death.

CHARLES	I couldn't agree more.

ELVIRA	Which is why I want a divorce.

CHARLES	With pleasure.

CHARLES	And I know just the person who can execute that.

ELVIRA	Good.

NARRATIVE TITLE	AMBULANCE

CHARLES	Move over. No way I'm putting my life in your hands again.

ELVIRA	Don't flatter yourself, Charles.

ELVIRA	When I think of what might have happened if I'd succeeded

ELVIRA	in getting you to the other side, it makes me shudder.

ELVIRA	Nothing but bickering and squabbling for eternity.

ELVIRA	Drive.

CHARLES	Looking back on our married years, I can see now with horrid clarity

CHARLES	they were nothing but a mockery.

CHARLES	You were feckless, irresponsible,morally unstable.

CHARLES	I think I realised that before we left Budleigh Salterton.

ELVIRA	Nobody but a monumental bore

ELVIRA	would have thought of going to Budleigh Salterton for a honeymoon.

CHARLES	What's the matter with Budleigh Salterton?

ELVIRA	Seven hours a day on a damp golf course

ELVIRA	and a three-piece orchestra playing Merrie England.

CHARLES	I'm surprised you didn't complain at the time.

CHARLES	I remember you being quite good at that.

ELVIRA	I did complain. But you wouldn't listen.

ELVIRA	That's why I took a romantic stroll on the moors

ELVIRA	with Captain Bracegirdle.

CHARLES	What a blind fool I was.

CHARLES	Did he make love to you?

ELVIRA	Only very discreetly.

MADAME ARCATI	Mr Condomine. I'm so relieved you've arrived safely.

MADAME ARCATI	Follow me.

MADAME ARCATI	Tonight the moon is full and we must harness its power.

CHARLES	We're both ready to perform the banishment ceremony immediately.

MADAME ARCATI	She's here?

ELVIRA	Yes.

MADAME ARCATI	Are you sure she's amenable to the process?

CHARLES AND ELVIRA	Yes.


MADAME ARCATI	With this magic smoke I invoke the spirit of moon fire,

MADAME ARCATI	dancer of time,

MADAME ARCATI	mistress of endings and beginnings.

MADAME ARCATI	Return our sacred sister to her rightful sphere.

MADAME ARCATI	Still here?

CHARLES	Yes.

MADAME ARCATI	To you, the spirit of earth.

MADAME ARCATI	To you, the element of air.

MADAME ARCATI	To you, the force of water.

MADAME ARCATI	To you, the power of fire.

MADAME ARCATI	And the gift of enchanters' dew.

MADAME ARCATI	She still here?

ELVIRA	Yes.

CHARLES	Yes.

MADAME ARCATI	Ghostly spectre, ghoul and fiend,

MADAME ARCATI	never more be thou convened.

MADAME ARCATI	Wolfsbane and holy rite

MADAME ARCATI	banish thee into the night.

MADAME ARCATI	Bladderwort.

MADAME ARCATI	Yes. Now, yes.

MADAME ARCATI	And bladderwort.

CHARLES	Ruth.

MADAME ARCATI	Ruth?

CHARLES	Darling, I'm so happy to see you again.

MADAME ARCATI	Blast. How could I have been such a duffer?

MADAME ARCATI	Something must have gone hideously wrong.

CHARLES	Yes, not for the first time.

RUTH	You hussy.

CHARLES	Darling.

ELVIRA	Save yourself the effort.

ELVIRA	I'm already dead, and, more to the point, so are you.

ELVIRA	You popped your clogs last Tuesday.

CHARLES	Don't be so insensitive.

CHARLES	Darling, are you in any pain?

RUTH	Charles, what happened to me?

CHARLES	There was a car accident.

ELVIRA	Which, I have to admit, I had a hand in.

ELVIRA	I'm sorry, Ruth.

RUTH	I'm afraid sorry doesn't quite cut it.

ELVIRA	Well, even so, in the spirit of complete openness,


ELVIRA	I'd also like to apologise for conducting an affair with Charles

ELVIRA	right under your nose.

ELVIRA	Well, technically, we are still married, so...

CHARLES	Stop it, Elvira. Ruth has been through quite enough.

MADAME ARCATI	What are they saying, Mr Condomine?

CHARLES	Not now, Madame Arcati.

CHARLES	Things are becoming quite strained.

MADAME ARCATI	You know, I should have squeezed malum citrea at the crucial point.

MADAME ARCATI	That's lemon juice.

ELVIRA	The only reason he was able

ELVIRA	to get through that screenplay in five days flat

ELVIRA	is because I wrote it.

CHARLES	Yes...

RUTH	Charles, is that true?

CHARLES	Not exactly.

ELVIRA	And Charles didn't want to tell you we'd finished

ELVIRA	because he wanted to spend more time alone with me.

RUTH	Charles.

CHARLES	Let's not fight, darling.

ELVIRA	Which darling are you referring to?

RUTH	But after everything I put up with, how could you do that to me?

CHARLES	It's not that straightforward, darlings.

RUTH	I mean, really, Charles, you never loved Elvira or me.

RUTH	The only person that you loved is yourself.

ELVIRA	Finally, something we do agree on.

RUTH	If you wrote the script, did he write any of those books?

ELVIRA	No, not a word.

RUTH	He took all the glory?

MADAME ARCATI	Aren't you staying for the second act?

CHARLES	I think it's best I leave.

MADAME ARCATI	Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

CHARLES	Try two of them.

CHARLES	Good luck with the lemons.

ELVIRA	Where did he go?

RUTH	He can run...

ELVIRA	But he can't hide.

MADAME ARCATI	Ghostly spectre, ghoul or fiend,

MADAME ARCATI	never more be thou convened.

MADAME ARCATI	Bladderwort, wolfsbane and holy rite,

MADAME ARCATI	banish thee into the night.

MADAME ARCATI	Donald?

HEDDA HOPPER	Mr Condomine. Hedda Hopper, Los Angeles Times.

CHARLES	Hello.

HEDDA HOPPER	How does it feel to be the talk of the town?

CHARLES	That's awfully sweet of you,

CHARLES	but I'm not sure anybody's really interested in the lowly writer.

HEDDA HOPPER	I have a hunch that my 35 million readers

HEDDA HOPPER	will be enthralled by the story of a serial plagiarist.

HENRY	Plagiarist?

CHARLES	I know you revel in gossip and scandal, Miss Hopper,

CHARLES	but that's a completely outrageous and unfounded accusation.

HEDDA HOPPER	There is nothing unfounded about the writ that Señor Morales is serving.

HEDDA HOPPER	Would you care to comment on the fact

HEDDA HOPPER	that your 15 Detective Frank Flowers whodunnits

HEDDA HOPPER	are based word for word

HEDDA HOPPER	on the Inspector Francisco Flores crime novels

HEDDA HOPPER	which are bestsellers across all of Mexico?

HEDDA HOPPER	Say cheese, Mr Condomine.

CHARLES	You.

ELVIRA	Don't look so shocked, Charles.

ELVIRA	You and I both know there's no such thing as an original story.

CHARLES	How could you?

CECIL B DEMILLE	Can't you just be quiet?

CECIL B DEMILLE	I'm trying to make a picture here.

CHARLES	You scheming little witch.

HEDDA HOPPER	So much for the famous British charm.

ELVIRA SINGS	I'll be loving you Always

ELVIRA	With a love that's true...

CHARLES	Stop it.

ELVIRA	Always...

CHARLES	Don't.

CHARLES	Stop it! No.

ELVIRA	Your first novel?

ELVIRA	Greta Garbo speaking my words?

CHARLES	Stop it.

ELVIRA	You and I both know there's no such thing as an original story.

RUTH	Promise you can't touch her.

ELVIRA	I'm a woman, Charles. We're used to not getting the credit we deserve.

RUTH	The only person that you love is yourself.

CHARLES	What the hell do you think you're doing? You could have killed me.

RUTH	I just did.

RUTH	Nobody will ever forget you, Charles.

ELVIRA	They'll remember what a fraud you were. Always.

RUTH	Farewell, Mr Peasbody!
