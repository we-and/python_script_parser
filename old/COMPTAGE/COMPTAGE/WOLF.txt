??	You're a loser, it's just a fact.

??	But what if  I told you

??	that I could help you change all of that.

??	I'm a winner but then you probably already know that.

??	I'm also a  connoisseur and a curator

??	of the best life  has to offer.

??	Everything that you'll never get to experience until now.

??	Leveraging my excellent palette and dark star technology,

??	we have strategically  created Chicken Milk Beer,

??	so that everyone can have  a little taste of my success.

??	So go on, slam a--

??	(mic feedback)

??	Fucking, fuck!

??	Cut!

??	(buzzer beeps)

??	(whack)

??	Our existence hinges on the next  hours.

??	One more thing, let's kill the fucking sound, hmm?

??	Now, where are  we with the prototype?

??	See for yourself.

??	(buzzing, whirring)

??	(chuckles)

??	I like it.

??	It's sort of cute.

??	So, we're on  track for the test?

??	Broadcast  window secured.


??	(bang)

??	(gaging)

??	(muffled breaths)

??	So, where in the good goddamn is my alpha subject?

??	(sirens)

??	Woah!

??	If we don't make this delivery in five minutes, we are dead!

??	Dead!  You hear me!?

??	(sirens)

??	(gunshot)

??	Fucking hell!

??	(tires screech)

??	Come on,  hold it down!

??	(gunshots)

??	(screams)

??	Hold it down!

??	Merry Christmas!

??	(gunshots)

??	(car swerving)

??	(gunshots)

??	I'm gonna  blow you up!

??	(boom)

??	(fire crackling, sirens)

??	Woo!

??	Nice!

??	(honking)

??	Woo!

??	(bang)

??	What's all  the noise, boys?

??	What was that?

??	Check it out.

??	(bang)

??	(wind whipping)

??	(screaming)

??	So chief, think we'll see any action tonight?

??	Oh, Scott I was an eager rookie once too.

??	You need to  learn in this job,

??	it's not about  looking for action,

??	it's about  preventing it.

??	You should be  writing that down.

??	Oh, uhh I was keeping  my notebook in my holster

??	but then I need  that for my gun.

??	I lost it so, you know how that goes.

??	It's uhh,  it's fine.

??	(banging on roof)

??	Boys?

??	You gotta give  me an update, boys!

??	(crash)

??	(screaming)

??	(grunting)

??	Are you  grasping my lessons?

??	I think I'm getting a grip of it.

??	(growling)

??	What the  fuck is happening?

??	(werewolf growling)

??	Because you need to  keep your eye on the prize.

??	(werewolf snarling)

??	No!

??	Got it, chief!

??	Eye, prize--

??	And everything else that you say, chief.

??	(growling)

??	Wipers aren't working.

??	(growling)

??	Looks like I brought  a knife to a wolf fight.

??	(growls)

??	(screaming)

??	(flesh tearing)

??	The only way to get a leg up in this job is to be vigilant.

??	Cool,  like the Wolfcop?

??	That thing is not the law, it is a perverse myth.

??	You have a better chance of seeing Santa Claus.

??	(coffee spills)

??	(screaming)

??	(gunshots)

??	(screaming)

??	Don't even!

??	(crash)

??	(sirens)

??	No!

??	No!  My fucking Wolfcop!

??	Suspect heading towards station, prepare intercept.

??	(sirens)

??	You dead back there?

??	Oh shit!

??	(growling)

??	(sirens)

??	Hands where  I can see em'!

??	(gun cocks)

??	Go.

??	(door opens)

??	Rookie, we clear?

??	Check em' out chief, perps' already bagged.

??	Dammit Daisy,  that is evidence.

??	(chuckles)

??	Tina: Oh god.

??	(gaging)

??	(gunshot fires)

??	(Werewolf howls)

??	There's an animal,  something big!

??	I swear I put a round in it.

??	It's probably just a raccoon, fat off town trash.

??	Well okay, Columbo.

??	Can the  detective work.

??	Grab the tape,  set up a  metre perimeter

??	before the lookie-loo's start showing up.

??	Okay.

??	Yeah okay,  sorry Chief, yeah.

??	Oh, fuck sake!

??	Some one  stole our donuts.

??	You're in charge until I get back.

??	(heavy metal playing)

??	I can  put up with a lot,

??	but stealing donuts that's a new low.

??	You can't  keep doing this Lou.

??	You promised me  you would stay locked up.

??	Do you have any idea the shit storm you caused last night?

??	The new Recruits?

??	Suspicious.

??	And you know  what they're calling you?

??	Fucking WolfCop.

??	Where's your car?

??	(imitates an explosion)

??	Your pants?

??	Rookie's a good shot,  I'll give'r that.

??	(laughing)

??	(growling)

??	(snarling)

??	What if a bystander got hit, hmm?

??	What the hell were you thinking?

??	Shifters.

??	Okay, until we know  who we can trust,

??	this becomes  our new home base.

??	I will see you bright and early on duty with donuts.

??	And put on  some fucking pants.

??	Poke an eye out  with that thing.

??	Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant 

??	Oh come ye 

??	DJ Dan: Brrr! It's cold out there in Woodhaven.

??	It's cold like a--

??	DJ Bob:  My wife's heart.

??	(laughing)

??	DJ Bob: She doesn't--

??	(horn honks)

??	--me anymore.

??	DJ Dan: What?

??	DJ Bob: Never mind.

??	DJ Dan: Uh, okay. This is BAD Radio, I'm Dan and he's--

??	DJ Bob: Bob!

??	DJ Dan: Well it must  be a Christmas miracle,

??	because filthy rich billionaire Sydney Swallows

??	is reopening the old brewery.

??	DJ Bob: A welcome change to Woodhavens not just consuming

??	mass quantities of booze,  but now making it.

??	(men laughing)

??	Rumour has it  Interim-Mayor Bubba Rich

??	made a pretty penny off that deal.

??	DJ Dan: Hey and if that's not enough to be thankful for,

??	"Santa Swallows" is also retrofitting the brewery

??	into a sleek  new hockey arena!

??	DJ Bob:  What's the name?

??	We're the Woodhaven Darkstars will play their first home game

??	this Christmas Eve.

??	The game is free,  so get there early!

??	DJ Dan:  Oh and always,

??	this BAD radio update is brought to you by--

??	Both: Liquor Donuts!

??	What more  could you ask for?

??	I'm still trying  to get that image

??	of your dick  out of my head.

??	Look at this!

??	People are  gonna see this!

??	Oh god.

??	Okay, try now.

??	Tina!

??	I'm coming!

??	(engine stalls)

??	Fuck!

??	Stubborn piece of shit!

??	Alright, again!

??	(engine starts)


??	Yeah!

??	Yes, good job, Lou.

??	Took long enough.

??	Come here.

??	Repeat it back to me.

??	Dump the bodies at the morgue.

??	Dump the  present at HQ.

??	Torch the van.

??	And?

??	Don't stop for a beer.

??	No, I mean it, not even a quick chug-a-roo.

??	Alright, I got it.

??	I'm serious, I'm keeping you locked up tonight.

??	No more  "lone wolf" crap.

??	You've got to  be kidding me.

??	What are you staring at it for, man?

??	Don't be shy,  give it a try.

??	Just pop it and just, glug, glug, glug!

??	I'm on-I'm on duty.

??	Well--

??	Hey, everything under control, rookie?

??	Uhh, yes, Chief.

??	Interim-Mayor Rich  is just showing off

??	what the new brewery is cooking up.

??	I don't know if I was technically showing off

??	but yeah,  I was just sharing.

??	I thought.

??	"Slamma' Cold Cock!"

??	That's my way  of saying hi.

??	What do you think?

??	It's a slogan, man, for the beer!

??	Try it!  It's amazing!

??	Go ahead, go ahead!

??	Chicken Milk, right?

??	Yeah, that's catchy

??	but I don't think you came here to pitch me, Bubba.

??	No.

??	Wha--  Bubba?

??	I don't think we're on a first name familiarity here at all.

??	She, maybe could call me Bubba, you could call me Mayor Rich.

??	Still pitching.

??	Yes, I'm still pitching  because reopening the plant

??	is key to the revitalization of Woodhaven.

??	Let me tell you  something young lady,

??	considering what it took to convince Sydney Swallows

??	and all the  Darkstar shareholders--

??	(engine stalls)

??	We don't need any unnecessary tension, do we?

??	Thanks for the advice

??	but I think we have  things under control.

??	Woodhaven P.D.  is all about discretion.


??	Hmm.

??	(crash)

??	(engine screeches)

??	Yeah, you've got everything under control.

??	How many people  have died in the last,

??	oh I don't know,  ten minutes?

??	People dropping,  like it's cra--

??	They're dropping  left and right.

??	I'm hearing it's a giant fucking WolfCop.

??	Are you hearing that?

??	Thanks, tips.

??	You know you might wanna try that it'll take the edges off.

??	I'm more of a black coffee gal, Bubba.

??	Well, I'm a black gal guy.

??	(can opens)

??	I'm gonna ask you one very important question, Tina,

??	and then  I'm gonna leave.

??	Hopefully you'll  answer me and if not,

??	it'll just dramatically hang in the air.

??	Ready?

??	How come you never see this WolfCop and this Lou Grou

??	in the same place at the same time?

??	Uhh--

??	A WolfCop?

??	Goddammit that  sounds metal.

??	(guitar rift plays)

??	Rookie.

??	Tina.

??	Yeah, I cracked  that package.

??	I don't know, some kind of lizard goo.

??	I don't know,

??	this is where Willie  would've been really helpful.

??	Okay, bye.

??	(screaming)

??	Well, that fuckin' hurt, you dick!

??	Willie?

??	Hi Lou.

??	Hey man, before we, you know, hug it out and all that shit,

??	I gotta know one thing, any of this goo yours?

??	On TV: (bell dings)

??	(alarm sounds)

??	Man: Shoplifter!

??	(grunting)

??	Woman: Help!

??	Cheers, man!

??	Nothing like a  fucking Dale ail.

??	So, how much  do you remember?

??	I remember like, I don't fucking--

??	Bits and  Bobs, man, like--

??	There was like this beautiful big, fucking bright light.

??	(grunts)

??	Which I think was a distraction because behind me

??	there was like a  huge bulbous, smooth shaft--

??	(drilling)

??	Fellas!  What is this?

??	--that penetrated me.

??	(screaming)

??	With--

??	Oh, that's kinda nice.

??	And there were some weird fucking weird

??	reptilioids dudes, man.

??	(screaming)

??	They umm, they fucking violated me, Lou.

??	What do know about Shapeshifters?

??	Well, if we're just gonna gloss over what I just said

??	about the fucking  huge bulbous shafts

??	and, no means yes  in their land.

??	I don't know, man, shifters are my fucking sisters bag.

??	I'm more about  like fucking drones

??	and chem-trails  and sasquatch.

??	Hey!

??	Did you ever find that fucking Sasquatch, man?

??	You know,  I was this close, Lou!

??	Willie! Focus.

??	Shifters.

??	Okay, shit, uhh--

??	So, well,  basic theory is:

??	they're trying  to control the world

??	by assuming the identities of fucking regular folks, man,

??	I mean--

??	Holy fuck, Lou!

??	Did one of them take my place, man?

??	How much did I miss?

??	Oh, do I still own the fucking gun shop?

??	Am I still the coolest motherfucker in Woodhaven?

??	Does Tina Walsh  still love me?

??	Lou, how long  was I gone for?

??	A few months,  I wouldn't sweat it.

??	Don't swea--

??	Well, easy for you  to say, man.

??	You weren't fucked right in your identity.

??	Leveraging my excellent palette and dark star technology,

??	we have strategically  created Chicken Milk Beer,

??	so that everyone can have  a little taste of my success.

??	So, slam a cold cock and unleash a better you.

??	(stomach rumbles)

??	Oh.

??	Hey Lou, umm--

??	(belches)

??	(stomach rumbles,  groaning)

??	Is it getting  hot in here, man?

??	No, not really.

??	You got a  little boys room?

??	(farts)

??	Hey.

??	(snapping fingers)

??	Down the hall.

??	(farting)

??	Oh shit.

??	(dialtone)

??	Yeah, Tina?

??	You're never gonna believe what I found in that crate?

??	Willie: Umm, Lou?

??	Yeah, is  everything okay?

??	Well, uhh, is there any chance you feel like going on a

??	gitch run bend?

??	Tina:  Hey, is that Willie?

??	Don't hang up.

??	(electric spark)

??	What's this?

??	Insurance.

??	Frank will preoccupy the police so there isn't a repeat

??	of lasts nights debacle.

??	(electric spark)

??	You named him Frank?

??	Smells like old people.

??	(electric jolt)

??	Really smells.

??	(robotic whirring)

??	Man over PA: Happy Christmas!

??	Merry Hanukkah!

??	Joyous Kwanza!

??	Carl.

??	You got the rights for this stuff?

??	Oh yeah.

??	WolfCop is an official mascot!

??	We share profits.

??	(cha-ching)

??	Yeah, okay.

??	Man over PA: Today's special: Dale's six packs.

??	Now $..

??	Enter now to be first to taste Chicken Milk stout.

??	So delicious,  so creamy and delicious.

??	Shut your face  the T.V. news is on!

??	Reporter: It sat  dormant for decades,

??	but now the old Woodhaven Brewery is days from reopening,

??	thanks to visionary business maverick

??	and best-selling author Sydney Swallows.

??	Mr. Swallows, given your business interests

??	all around the world, why Woodhaven?

??	Well Sandy,  as an entrepreneur,

??	I'm always looking to  maximize my investments.

??	I like to win.

??	Now Woodhaven's depressed economy and cheap labour force

??	made it a  natural fit for Darkstar

??	and besides if there's one thing that Woodhaven knows,

??	it's cheap ass beer.

??	Hell yeah!

??	Fucking sheep.

??	You can thank your lucky "Darkstars"

??	because Chicken Milk  is about to save your--

??	Thank you,  Mr. Swallows.

??	(laughing)

??	Thank you.

??	So, where  are you from?

??	Here in Woodhaven.

??	(nervous giggle)

??	Director:  C-cut the piece.

??	Swallows.

??	(news theme plays)

??	Hey,  what time is it?

??	It's almost ten-o-clock.

??	Oh, shit.

??	Anncr: Okay,  that's unexpected!

??	Well, as for the weekend,  uhh it's gonna be a beautiful--

??	(robotic whirring)

??	(faux french accent)

??	Bonjour, and  welcome to Club--

??	Fuck!

??	(squeaking)

??	(moaning)

??	Lou?

??	Lou?

??	Cutting it close.

??	Seen Will, yet?

??	How do we know it's really Willie?

??	(sigh)

??	Really Willie?

??	Mind your  fucking peepers!

??	(farting)

??	Oh, this isn't a shit,  this is not a shit!

??	(quick breaths)

??	(groaning)

??	It's in me, man!

??	You will not lose to a shit!

??	(high pitched squealing)

??	(groaning in pain)

??	(cheering)

??	Give the girls a hand!

??	You piece of shit!

??	(screeching)

??	(screaming in pain)

??	(girls screaming)

??	(roaring)

??	(screaming)

??	(growling)

??	(screaming)

??	(growling)

??	How big are you?

??	(crickets chirring)

??	(bangs on door)

??	Lou, you good?

??	(roars)

??	No bullshit tonight, howl if you need me.

??	I'm afraid I have some bad news for you, Ken.

??	You have cancer.

??	(laughing)

??	You also have aids.

??	(laughter continues)

??	Wakey wakey,  pickle kisser!

??	Who the fuck  said that, man!

??	You with me,  nutsack?

??	(high pitched scream)

??	Quit the  drama, Nancy.

??	This can't be  fucking real.

??	You are not real.

??	Get-out-of-my-belly!

??	I really don't have time for this.

??	(muffled talking)

??	I'm tripping balls!

??	Lou!

??	Willie: Lou!

??	(distorted voice  on walkie)

??	Go for Chief,  what's up?

??	(high pitched  distorted voice)

??	Details?

??	(high pitched distorted voice continues)

??	Okay, copy that.

??	Keep me posted.

??	Good work.

??	(high pitched distorted voice continues)

??	Maybe.

??	Willie: Uhh,  Lou Grou, Lou!

??	Do you have  any fucking duct tape

??	or a hammer or like  ad-fucking-vice or something--

??	Tina, woah!

??	It's Chief Walsh and don't you take a goddamn step, Higgins.

??	Chief Walsh, I always knew you could do it.

??	You are  a fucking vision.

??	Well, being the peoples chief does agree with me.

??	Oh, it agrees with me too,  come over here you--

??	Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

??	How do I know  it's really you?

??	The last time I saw you,  you were a shifter.

??	Simple solution, are you feeling the same or similar butterflies

??	to what you felt  the last time you saw me?

??	When I saw you  I shot you dead.

??	I recommend you be  as honest as possible.

??	Honesty?

??	Umm, okay well I gotta show you something rather personal.

??	I always pictured  this going down

??	a little bit differently but umm--

??	No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

??	You need to  fucking see this!

??	(zipper unzipping)

??	Voila!

??	Hi sweet tits!

??	Fuck me.

??	Would you say  that this is a bad thing?

??	It's not good.

??	In terms of us, is it uhh, fucking game-changer.

??	Are you insane?

??	Hey, why don't you give one eye a kiss.

??	Hey!

??	(slaps)

??	Owh!

??	Uhh, so, umm what would you suggest we do?

??	(howls)

??	I got a  bad feeling about this.

??	Probably cause you're drinking that rooster juice beer.

??	It's not beer,  it's stout.

??	Whatever.

??	I don't wanna die, not on my birthday.

??	(echoed scream)

??	Fallback,  need backup ASAP.


??	(beeping)

??	(mechanical whirring)

??	Freeze!

??	(gunshots)

??	(Scott screaming)

??	Scott!

??	I can get it off,  one shot.

??	I bet you can.

??	That's what he said.

??	(high pitched distorted voice over walkie)

??	Go, what's  your location.

??	We're at  Club Phoque!

??	Officer Scott's still  in the building and--

??	(high pitched distorted voice over walkie)

??	Hang tight, rookie.

??	(distorted voice  over walkie)

??	Back up, ASAP!

??	I love an ass  in uniform.

??	Hey!

??	You respect the fucking lady,  I will stuff you in my asshole

??	and choke you  out with my anus.

??	Owh!  You little fucker.

??	Owh!  You little fuck!

??	Jesus!

??	Hey, hey!  What about Lou?!

??	(Lou growls)

??	(zipper zips up)

??	Lou, you're a Wolf.

??	Cop.

??	I get that,

??	I think you're missing  the bigger issue here though.

??	the fucking wolf part man!

??	(laughing)

??	Daisy!

??	I never  should've left him.

??	Shit!

??	Lou, woah, Lou! 

??	Stand down!

??	Rookie, gun!

??	Alright, set up  a perimeter, you stay here!

??	Listen to me, team work, okay?

??	On my mark! One, two--

??	(roars)

??	Fucking hell, Lou.

??	As your commanding officer I order you to stand down.

??	(growling)

??	(gun cocks)

??	(shots fire, metal clanks)

??	(gun cocks)

??	(supernatural whirring)

??	(growling)

??	(crash)

??	(growling)

??	(crash)

??	(roaring)

??	(metal clanks)

??	(low growl)

??	(shots firing)

??	Hey asshole!

??	Come on,  come on, come on!

??	Come on!

??	Get in there!

??	Are you okay?

??	We're alive.

??	Come here, Lou.

??	Get him out of here, now!

??	Mutant: Let me see the ladies,  I smell them.

??	Please ignore me, I'm not myself.

??	Don't worry,  I got Lou.

??	(heavy breaths)

??	(Echoing)  Morning sunshine.

??	You gave us quite a scare.

??	Lou Garou,  you were such an animal.

??	You thirsty?

??	Get over here!

??	Lou, what's wrong?

??	Wake up!

??	(grunting)

??	Hang in there, buddy.

??	Lou, Willie's got a plan to make you better.

??	I just hope  she lets us in.

??	The only  body left intact.

??	Gonna be  a busy night.

??	You ever seen anything like this before?

??	No, never.

??	Let me know when  you've got him cracked open.

??	Willie: I can't believe I'm back in the vag'.

??	Hey Lou, there's your Dad.

??	(banging on door)

??	Namaste, sister.

??	Oh, he's barely a fucking cop and he's my friend

??	and he's  the best guy around!

??	Open up,  you owe me!

??	Watch your  sassy mouth!

??	Lou, come on, man.

??	Space alien  impregnates a woman.

??	Is that what you are man, you little fucker?

??	Okay.

??	(sigh)

??	It's a  miracle he's alive.

??	Well, Lou Garou is the strongest and bravest man that I know.

??	(sniffing)

??	What are you doing?

??	Oh my god!

??	He's a Lycan!

??	And a werewolf,  not the point.

??	Can you please fix him!?

??	Hey, that occult book, mom left that to me.

??	You can use it now to save Lou but it's my book.

??	(machine whirring)

??	Woo, shit!

??	Any trouble  recovering him?

??	(beeping sounds)

??	A lycan lawman?

??	Tell me Frank  finished him off?

??	We're less than  hours from our big coming out.

??	If that thing rears it's hairy head one more time,

??	I want it  on my mantel.

??	(electric spark)

??	(laughing)

??	Wait so,  this is your plan,

??	you're gonna save Lou  with a dusty piece of shit?

??	(tapping)

??	Kat, come on.

??	Hey, you sure  that's a-that's a good idea.

??	I mean, I do know that  he can't fucking afford it.

??	(inhaling)

??	(groaning)

??	You wouldn't happen to have a beer handy, would ya?

??	Oh, thank god!

??	Are you an angel?

??	What?

??	I'm Kat.

??	Oh, what'd you give me?

??	The Moon!

??	A piece of it anyway, acquired during the Apollo missions.

??	Easy now.

??	Just like  any great remedy,

??	it has the huge  potential to be abused.

??	Lou, you look fucking amazing, man.

??	That moon rock works fucking fast.

??	That robo-freak really did a number on me.

??	You need to heal.

??	I need to get  back to Woodhaven.

??	Lou, you're not  better, man,

??	you're on some high-octane  lunar fucking cocaine.

??	Five minutes ago you looked like a bag of smashed assholes.

??	I feel way  better, I'm okay.

??	Then how is it  that a little kitty

??	can pin down  a big bad wolf?

??	Okay, getting weird.

??	Keep your distance,  come on now.

??	Rest.

??	Get your  strength back.

??	So happy  you're better.

??	You really  came through,

??	you saved the day, okay and I miss this, man!

??	Like you and I battling the big bad occult world.

??	Me too.

??	Well, then come back with us, back home!

??	I can't go back to Woodhaven, it's not-It's not safe.

??	Dude, we have  a fucking WolfCop.

??	If Lou were smart, he would get in his car and disappear.

??	Well,  Lou ain't like you.

??	And he's not smart.

??	Chief.

??	Can we talk?

??	About Scott?

??	Look, as someone who has seen a lot of death and frankly,

??	mostly by my own hand,  I can assure you

??	it does get better, okay?

??	And sometimes  it's even fun, good talk.

??	I can't believe people  really think that Chicken Milk

??	is gonna  "transform" Woodhaven.

??	(scoffs in disbelief)

??	What is it chief?

??	You're a genius.

??	Suit up,  we're going on a fieldtrip.

??	We're in the cutter  smoking bud into the water for the first time  this year  

??	I'm going swimming  with the women and it's just like  a commercial for beer 

??	I woke up, I didn't know where  I was and then all of the sudden

??	I see  fucking Lou Garou.

??	He punched me right in the fucking face.

??	(laughing)

??	What?

??	Next round's on me.

??	Okay.

??	So, what's her story?

??	You mean besides the fact that she's off limits to you

??	and anyone  else in here?

??	We were tight  growing up, I mean super tight.

??	She basically raised me,  which is weird because you know,

??	she's my  younger sister.

??	Down the drain,  flush it 

??	Flush it 

??	Yeah but then  a few years ago, man,

??	she changed like  fucking out of nowhere.

??	You know, sealed herself  off I didn't see her,

??	it's like I was lost and Bambi in the woods.

??	It was really tough.

??	Why?

??	Mutant: 'Cause  he wants to fuck her.

??	You say something?

??	I'm pretty  fucking tuckered.

??	Mutant:  Get all up in that ass!

??	Well, I'm hungry?

??	Where's the fucking menu,  I could eat for two.

??	(slap)

??	(crash)

??	Is that my sister?

??	To recovery.

??	And abstinence and respecting people's siblings.

??	Mutant:  Give me my drink!

??	You okay?

??	Uhhhh, yeah.

??	No, I mean, I'm not feeling right exactly.

??	Mutant:  Let me out of here.

??	(Willie making noises over mutant)

??	Yeah,  I'm gonna go tuck in.

??	Bye.

??	Does he seem a bit off to you?

??	(wind whipping)

??	The rink thermostat has been dialed in.

??	The embryos  have stabilized.

??	Everything is  coming together.

??	Well then, we should really thank that Hairy Lycan fuck!

??	If he hadn't dwindled  our numbers so much,

??	we wouldn't have pushed  for this "final solution".

??	Excellent.

??	No bogarting the devil's lettuce, brother.

??	(inhaling)

??	Okay, man.

??	Easy, T-rex arms, I got you, man.

??	(coughing wildly)

??	(imitating a Jamaican accent) Everything is Irie.

??	(door bangs open)

??	Shit!  What the fuck?

??	What the fuck  are they doing?

??	Motherfuckers!

??	Fucking Lou Garou's about to use his fucking freedom stick

??	on my sister.

??	Mutant: Bang, band chicken shrimp.

??	No more  weed for you.

??	Is that moon dust?

??	I thought you said--

??	This isn't for you.

??	(sniffing)

??	(moaning)

??	Hey, you starting  without me?

??	(moaning)

??	(deep grunting)

??	(purring)

??	(screaming)

??	Motherfucker!

??	(panting)

??	Wow!

??	(purring)

??	(moaning)

??	(bed squeaking)

??	(purring)

??	(grunting)

??	(slimy sounds)

??	(moaning)

??	I still hear em'!

??	I can't listen to this shit, man.

??	You're a loser, it's just a fact.

??	Take that!

??	I could help you change, all of that.

??	I'm a winner.

??	Hey, you  like that, man?

??	Okay, lil' dude!

??	That's your jam?

??	Leveraging my excellent palate and Darkstar technology,

??	we strategically--

??	You feeling  okay, man?

??	Hmm?

??	(mutant grunting)

??	(Willie groans  in pain)

??	So, slam  a cold cock.

??	(screams)

??	Unleash a better you.

??	(screaming)

??	(air hisses)

??	Wow!

??	This is impressive.

??	This is why  rinks cost so much

??	because they're always putting stuff like this

??	underneath and then they work  it into the price of the ticket.

??	Whole thing reminds me of this porno I invested in once called

??	"The Cunt for Red October."

??	It didn't go  over very well

??	cause people  don't like that word.

??	October.

??	The nicest part about it, it's a hockey rink.

??	And there is nothing I like more in this world than hockey.

??	Well, except maybe fat stacks of coloured cash.

??	Well then, here's to  a fruitful partnership.

??	Mmm, look at  all that money.

??	Thank you!

??	Now this, this is worth leaving my Zumba class early for.

??	(can opens)

??	Mmm.

??	I'm gonna slam  a cold cock.

??	(slurping)

??	Oh.

??	(slurping)

??	Woah.

??	Crisp.

??	Oh, you really like your beer, don't you?

??	Feels good,  really feels good,

??	so you guys ready for  the puck drop or what?

??	Almost, we still have to test our PA system.

??	You're here just in time.

??	(whirring)

??	(Bubba's stomach  rumbles).

??	(farting)

??	You heard that, right?

??	(loud fart)

??	Oh!

??	Why do I--

??	(farting, groaning)

??	You son  of a bitch, Syd!

??	(groaning in pain)

??	(childlike laughter)

??	What the fuck!?

??	(mutant screeching)

??	It's glorious!

??	(screeching)

??	Get it off!

??	Son of a bitch!

??	(screaming)

??	(mutant chattering)

??	Come on, come on.

??	(mutant chatters)

??	Did he shit himself?


??	Daisy!

??	(alarm sounds)

??	(groans)

??	So, that happened.

??	Yeah,  does Willie know?

??	Well, we were  pretty loud.

??	No, I mean  about you being--

??	Fucking with you.

??	I wanted to tell him, but he wasn't himself.

??	Even now I feel like he's hiding something--

??	(banging on door)

??	Willie: Hey fucking, Turner and Hooch, stop fucking please!

??	Coming William.

??	Shit just got real!

??	Come out, come out wherever you are little buddy!

??	Just be a man, I got more of that fucking weed.

??	You guys keep  your eyes fucking peeled.

??	He's fast and  he's fucking bulbous.

??	Who?

??	Bad Willie.

??	(hissing)

??	That's a shifter hiss!

??	What're you--

??	No way he's a fucking shifter but he's smaller,

??	nastier and I think he's my son.

??	(chatter sounds)

??	(squealing)

??	(screaming)

??	Fucking Karma!

??	(screaming)

??	(mutant chatters)

??	(pots and pans clang)

??	(chattering)

??	Move.

??	That was the worst fucking four hours of my life.

??	You were so loud,

??	you didn't even fucking  hear me fucking crown!

??	Lou:  Oh god damn!

??	I just  gave birth to that.

??	(mutant chatters)

??	Shoot this fucker.

??	(chatters)

??	Nope, he's  my dude, I can't.

??	(gunshot fires)

??	(squeals)

??	Ouu!

??	(groans)

??	(heavy breathing)

??	What like, you two don't have secrets?

??	This is bad.

??	Earth's atmosphere prevents Shifters from reproducing,

??	but if they've found a way  to impregnate humans--

??	We're fucked.

??	(cellphone rings)

??	Hello?

??	Woah, woah, woah, slow down.

??	Don't do anything, we're on our way.

??	DJ Bob: Hey Dan  we're tick, tick, tickin' down

??	to the big game between the Woodhaven Darkstars

??	and those rotten Regina Potashers!

??	DJ Dan: Ouh!  I can't wait!

??	And between that, and  the throwing of the switch

??	on the new brewery, folks are calling Swallows

??	the saviour  of Woodhaven,

??	while others fear we may be putting too many eggs

??	in that old Chicken Milk basket.

??	DJ Bob: Oh boy!

??	Don't forget to stock up on game gitch.

??	The first hundred through  the door get a free

??	skate sharpening compliments of--

??	DJ Bob & Dan:  Liquor Donuts!

??	Thank god.

??	Oh, you guys.

??	We're good.

??	Oh.

??	Tina.

??	Okay.

??	Lou, how are you?

??	Oh, he's pretty  good considering,

??	he just laid the fucking good wood into my sister.

??	What?

??	In case you cared.

??	I don't care.

??	I don't care about that.

??	(clicks tongue)

??	I don't care.

??	Uh-huh.

??	You are so fucking cute and the woman of my fucking dreams.

??	Hey Walter,  we got a fucking Desert Eagle.

??	Gimmie it! Gimmie it!

??	No, just--

??	Okay listen,  Swallows has Daisy.

??	We need to move.

??	Puck drops in .

??	Take that.

??	This thing's heavy.

??	Well, you'll  thank me later.

??	So what's  the plan, Chief?

??	This is one  of those times

??	I actually wish  we had a full moon.

??	Well, you are in luck the love of my life.

??	I happen to have a full fucking moon rock!

??	(chuckles)

??	Who wants  to party?

??	When you're waiting for something 

??	And it's  wasting your time 

??	With all the sensations that fill my mind 

??	When there's nothing to hide 

??	Announcer:  Ladies and gentlemen,

??	welcome to the first of many home games here at

??	the new  Darkstar Arena!

??	(crowd cheers)

??	I'm your maestro for the evening, Organo!

??	Organo: Now put your hands together for the visiting team,

??	The Regina Potashers!

??	(crowd boos)

??	(crowd hooting)

??	Organo: Yeah take that gitch Regina, that's what you want!

??	That's what you deserve!

??	I'm on the pond.

??	How we doin'?

??	(muffled distorted voice on walkie)

??	Nothing so far.

??	(high pitched distorted voice on walkie)

??	(generator  powering down)

??	Ladies and Gentlemen,  the man of the hour

??	and my close friend personal friend Sydney Swallows.

??	(crowd cheers)

??	Welcome.

??	You are all very fortunate to be here tonight.

??	Count your blessings.

??	(crowd cheers)

??	"Why invest  in Loserville?"

??	People keep asking me.

??	Because undervalued  real estate

??	and cheap labour  can only go so far,

??	in the end I had  to go with my gut

??	and trust that we could transform this shithole

??	into something  far superior.

??	You are all very, very blessed to be apart of it.

??	So,  stand with me!

??	And raise a toast.

??	I officially declare the Darkstar plant open!

??	(cheering)

??	(fireworks boom)

??	As if you didn't have enough to thank me for, allow me to

??	introduce you to your new  home team the Darkstars!

??	(cheering)

??	(mechanic whirring)

??	This flock is fucked.

??	Ladies and gentlemen,

??	please remain standing  for our national anthem.

??	(whirring)

??	(Oh Canada plays on a synthesizer)

??	Oh Canada 

??	Our home  and native land 

??	True patriot love in all thy sons command 

??	(crowds stomach grumbles,  crowd groaning)

??	With glowing hearts-- 

??	(crowds stomach grumbles, crowd groaning)

??	(whirring)

??	From far-- 

??	I've got some  repairs to do.

??	There's no zamboni here, darling.

??	What's that?

??	(grunting)

??	(buzzing)

??	Willie!

??	(Canadian anthem continues playing)

??	(crowd throwing up)

??	The Darkstars, I don't think they're human.

??	(sticks bang)

??	(crowd throwing up)

??	Oh Canada 

??	Yes!

??	  Time to die,  time to die 

??	(grumbling,  squishing sounds)

??	Rise my children!

??	(squishing sounds)

??	(squealing)

??	There's heavy action in the sound booth.

??	I'm gonna go check it out.

??	(distorted muffled voice on walkie)

??	Coming to you.

??	We fuckin' doing this?

??	We were doing this, man, but that's two minutes

??	for your face, five minutes  for that fucking breath!

??	Go!

??	(crowd hollering)

??	(growls)

??	(man screaming)

??	Oh my god, Willie!

??	(slashing)

??	Thank you.

??	God speed.

??	Organo: In place--

??	(chattering)

??	Music's over, Jack.

??	It's Organo.

??	What?

??	Your name's  fucking Organo?

??	You play the Organ, that's super fucking weird.

??	Why the fuck aren't you wearing pants!?

??	(gun clicks)

??	I recognize you.

??	I'm the one  who probed you.

??	It's time to die, you strange animal.

??	(Wolfcop snarling)

??	That's it!

??	Yes!

??	(gunshot fires)

??	(sizzling)

??	(deep chuckle)

??	What the fuck!?

??	(cheering)

??	Beat it.

??	Big fucking Wolfcop!

??	(snarling)

??	Well, well, well, if it isn't Mr. Harry Ball Sac himself.

??	You're a little late to the fucking party!

??	(screaming,  mutants chatter)

??	(whirring)

??	(mic feedback)

??	Check! Check! Check!

??	Origamo has left the fucking building!

??	This is your  DJ Willie Higgins.

??	Who the  hell is that?

??	I'd ask that your proceed in a calm and orderly fashion

??	to your nearest fucking exit.

??	Here is a little diddy to help you along.

??	Everyone out of here now!

??	(gunshot fires)

??	(crowd screams)

??	Shit.

??	Bring it on, beast man!

??	He's no fool 

??	Breaking every  single rule 

??	(gunshots fire)

??	(growling)

??	(slicing)

??	Ouu!

??	Fuck!

??	Willie: Fucking human  shish kebob, Lou!

??	(kissing sounds)

??	Well played, man!

??	(squirting)

??	Stronger than the eye of the tiger 

??	Kill her.

??	And he won't stop 

??	On our ice, we have a moron challenging fucking Wolfcop!

??	(cheerleaders holler)

??	He's a Wolfcop,  Wolfcop

??	(squishing sounds, flesh tearing)

??	Oh fuck!

??	(deep laughter)

??	Hmm.

??	Dude, you're playing skins for life, man!

??	I will not lose to a motherfucking Werewolf!

??	(snarling)

??	Get him!

??	(gunshots fire)

??	I need some  help down here!

??	(music stops)

??	Where are you?

??	Your right!  To the right!

??	Tina!

??	Sneaky bitch!

??	Hands off her!

??	I'm coming.

??	(bang, grunt)

??	(knuckles cracking)

??	Oh god, okay,  you know what?

??	Yes!

??	I'm ready for this. Mhmm.

??	Oh god, okay!

??	I am  highly trained, so.

??	(grunts)

??	Okay.

??	(grunting,  heavy breathing)

??	You are  fucking ridiculous!

??	Back off  my woman, bro!

??	(gunshot fires)

??	What the  hell was that?

??	Me saving you!

??	Also, that was  a woman.

??	Yeah, okay.

??	(clapping)

??	And we have a winner.

??	A notre Gagnon!

??	But unfortunately  for you,

??	you haven't read  my latest bestseller.

??	"Anticipate every outcome."

??	Wait for it!

??	(hockey organ tune)

??	Ta-da!

??	Get him boys!

??	Let's go!

??	Sayonara sucker!

??	He's playing  the coop.

??	Lou needs help!

??	Okay, you go get him, I'll get the wolfman!

??	Okay.

??	Hey, you're  a good man Higgins.

??	Okay so, this is happening right now?

??	Hey, you know,  I gotta go.

??	(muffled talking)

??	(cheerleaders hollering)

??	Oh, yeah!

??	Excuse me, can I borrow your sythe, brother?

??	Cheers!

??	(banging)

??	(cheerleaders hollering)

??	(growling)

??	(cheerleaders hollering)

??	(growls)

??	(slime sounds)

??	Come here boy, get your medicine.

??	(sniffing)

??	Take her down, man.

??	Oh, shit,  that's a lot.

??	(growls, cheerleaders holler)

??	(slicing)

??	(cheering)

??	(Zamboni honks)

??	It's that dude!

??	Forget it.

??	Come on.

??	Freeze.

??	(gunshot fires)

??	Oh shit!

??	Oh, good shooting, Tex!

??	On the ground and spread'em.

??	I don't think so.

??	(gunshots fire)

??	(howling)

??	Listen you little A-Cup Duo, look around, hmm?

??	(beeping)

??	The sooner  I go out that door,

??	the sooner you can go help your friends.

??	Or you can shoot me now and we all die right here.

??	(heavy breaths)

??	Merry Christmas, bitches.

??	Chief?

??	Do you think  he's bluffing?

??	Ask me in a minute.

??	Come on!

??	(growling)

??	Lou!

??	(growls)

??	No fucking way!

??	Kat?

??	Lou, you don't look good buddy.

??	Hang in there partner, I got some medicine.

??	Fuck, we're almost out of the moondust.

??	Call a vet, --!

??	Call your fucking dealer, answer me!

??	Meow!

??	Okay Lou, Lou!

??	What do you need?

??	What helps you?

??	Donuts, donuts, booze, booze, booze, booze!

??	Pass me the hooch.

??	Got a little bit left, make you a Higgins fucking smoothie.

??	Down the hatch!

??	You know what you're drinking Lou?

??	The moonshine, baby!

??	(grunts)

??	(howls)

??	(howling)

??	I'm glad  you're better, man,

??	but I still don't  approve of this shit.

??	Hi bitch,  wake up time.

??	(stomping)

??	(grunting)

??	The horror.

??	The paper work.

??	(laughing)

??	Hey uhh, sorry to  break up the party

??	but we have about  twenty seconds to get out.

??	Why?

??	Cause this shit's about to blow, come on!

??	Lou Garou.

??	Come on, Lou!

??	Go, go, go!

??	(explosion)

??	I guess  he wasn't bluffing.

??	Like I said, you'll thank me later.

??	(fire crackling)

??	Willie: Good thing we got those season tickets, huh Lou?
??	(chuckles)

??	See?

??	This is why  we can't have nice things.

??	So happy you decided to stay, sis.

??	Me too.

??	Let's take this to  the bar, Daisy's buying.

??	Why me?

??	Cause you  got kidnapped.

??	Rookie move.

??	Lou: Don't worry, kid,  I'll take you under my wing.

??	Oh, now  I'm really worried.

??	Willie: Shot gun!

??	Don't worry, there's some kitty litter back there.

??	Never know  what you'll find 

??	Don't understand your kind round' here 

??	(sirens)

??	Watching your moves they look so radical 

??	Hearing your words they sound fanatical 

??	Something inside reveals you're magical 

??	Oh, oh 

??	How can I get enough, you're a strange animal 

??	That's what I know 

??	But you're a strange animal, I gotta follow 

??	Woah-oh 

??	They've been trying to stick a light in your system 

??	Analyzing the defenses you hold 

??	Trying to open wide (trying to open wide) 

??	Hoping to step inside your soul 

??	Oh 

??	But everything here is unfamiliar 

??	Nothing they've seen remotely similar 

??	How can it be you're so peculiar, oh, oh 

??	How can  I get enough? 

??	You're a strange animal, that's what I know 

??	But you're a strange animal, I gotta follow 

??	Woah-oh-oh 

??	I gotta follow 

??	I gotta follow 

??	Woah-oh-oh 

??	It's important that  you avoid stress

??	and sudden facial movements, your sutures need time to heal.

??	Understood sister,  no smiling.

??	Well, the next bus should be here shortly.

??	How do I look?

??	Very--

??	Handsome.

??	A new man.

??	Can you even tell I had work done?

??	--May I help you cross?

??	(gulps)

??	You've already done  too much.

??	I think it's time for me to face the world as a new man.

??	(car accelerates)

??	(splattering)

??	(howling, screaming)
