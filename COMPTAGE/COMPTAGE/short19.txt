THE EARL OF SODOR	Well hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching.? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Henry is very excited because he's getting a nice new coat of paint! You do look very smart, Henry. In fact, I'd say you're glowing! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho

THE EARL OF SODOR	...But not everyone likes Henry's new look. In fact James doesn't seem pleased to see Henry at all!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	What colour was Henry's new paint? Was it blue? Was it yellow? Or was it green?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Henry's new paint was luminous green! It glowed in the dark and gave James a bit of a fright. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Never mind. Victor will have Henry repainted to the right colour green in no time!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray! That was fun. Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hugo is an extremely fast engine. To travel this fast he uses a special type of propeller to push him along the tracks.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Be careful, Hugo. You don't want all your passengers to blow away!

THE EARL OF SODOR	What pushes Hugo along the tracks? Is it a propeller? Is it an oar? Or is a rocket?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hugo has a propeller at the rear of his railcar. The propeller spins like a big fan and the air pushes him along the tracks.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Whoosh...!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh, jolly well done for playing! I look forward to seeing you again next time. Goodbye!
