(ALL WORDS MATTER)"
(Episode #105 Theme: STAKES IS)


NOLA	Can I be honest? When Opal cut me off...it hurt like a Motherfucker. I thought we had a connection. Well I lit up a Joint, finished some Work for the Diastopian Show and decided to end my “Man-Cleanse.” Admittedly, I'm still learning the meaning of Commitment and what it means to Trust someone. Even if that someone is Me and learning how to Trust my Intuition and not just my Impulses. I’m a Work in Progress. Your girl is back in the Saddle though. I know, I'm bugging, but I wouldn't say it like that. I would say it in a way the empowers me. Instead of saying, I was bugging, I'd say I'm Multi-Tasking. Excellent work, everybody. It seems you really dug deep to depict the images of your lives with these Album Covers.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Very interesting work, Class. Very... provocative. Yes?

HASSAN	What’s that mean, Ms. Moss? Provocative?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Provocative...in the way that I was using the term Hassan, means just what I said. The Work the Class has done is interesting.


KERVON	Yeah Hass...provocative like interesting, like that time when your Mom’s Big-Ass Titties fell outta dat Low Cut Top, when She was chasin’ your Ass down da Street last summer.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Alight Kervon. Class!

HASSAN	No, Kervon, it’s provocative like interesting like your Mom. Y’Know She Got One Leg With a Kickstand rocking one Jordan twelve!

KERVON	Nice one.

HASSAN	Just Jokes My Nigga, just Jokes.

NOLA	No, it's not just Jokes. You guys were playing The Dozens anyone know what that means? Playing the dozen was a term derived from African enslavement when anyone with a physical disability was sold in a group of twelve. And they often got those disabilities at the violent hands of their slaves owners. So it's never just jokes.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	It’s a very good point Ms. Darling. But right now, we need you to Pull Focus. We are here to Work.

NOLA	Reggie. This piece is... Well it’s provocative, in the best sense of the Word. The strongest sense of the Word.

REGGIE	Thank you.

NOLA	Wouldn’t you agree, Ms. Moss?


RAQUELETTA MOSS	Ms. Darling this is your Class. I am not here to impose my Views. I am just here to observe...but yes, Reggie’s work is very powerful. Alright, that's the bell. Walk, don’t run Ladies and Gentlemen.

NOLA	See you next week, everybody.

HARRIET T. STUD	See you next week, Ms. Darling.

REGGIE	You really think my work is Dope like that?

NOLA	Absolutely.

REGGIE	Cool. See you next week Miss Darling and Miss Moss.

NOLA	See you next week, thank you for your focus.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Alright. Ms. Darling, I want to commend you on your Work with the Students. You seemed to have developed a real rapport with them. However, I would like for you to stop by my Office so we can discuss a few things. Say tomorrow afternoon, Ms. Darling? Three- Thirty? Ms. Darling, Three-Thirty?

NOLA	Sure, Three-Thirty, no problem, got it. Okay, sorry, I got to run.


NOLA	Yo! Yo, yo, Mars!!


JAMIE	Mars? Damn, I’ve been told I take Ladies to the Moon! Must be my Interplanetary Tongue Game.

NOLA	Yeah. Yeah Jamie. Your Tongue Game sent me Flyin’ to Mars. It was like Stanley Kubrick 2001 a Space Odyssey good.

JAMIE	You know, Even without the Wood...I knew I could. So you forgive me now?

NOLA	But for real though. What was that? Like why am I crying. That was some Transcendental like... I don’t even know what to call it. Shit.

JAMIE	You know, it’s moments like this let's me know that I want to be with you All The Time.

NOLA	Well I am Honored but Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered.

JAMIE	So you’re saying I’m the one. The Only One?

NOLA	No. I’m still going to see other People.

JAMIE	What Nola gets Nola doesn’t want.

NOLA	You sound like Stokely.

JAMIE	One of the Dudes you’re seeing?

NOLA	Stokely is my Dad.

JAMIE	Your Dad? Is this some Oedipal Shit going on?

NOLA	I think you mean Electra. And, I hope that’s not why I want to see you, Jamie.

JAMIE	So your Father lets you call him by his First name?

NOLA	Not really. But musicians are Free Spirits, or at least they’re supposed to be. But enough about him. Who are you Mr. Overstreet?

JAMIE	Who am I? I’m the Man that wants to Wake Up with you when the Sun kisses the side of your Face in the morning and the Man that wants to Lay Down with you when the Moon softens the furrow of your Brow when you close your Eyes to Sleep at Night.

NOLA	Well I am a Woman who needs to sell some Damn Paintings.

JAMIE	Slow but Steady Wins The Race...

NOLA	No, I need to win the Race now, okay? I need that Red Dot “Sold” sticker, that Blood on the Walls under my Work. A Hundred Stacks piling northward.

JAMIE	I feel you and I’ll buy some more of your Art Work.

NOLA	I am not looking for a Handout, Jamie.

JAMIE	It’s not a Handout if I Love your Work. What's going on, talk to me.

NOLA	It’s my Gig as a Teaching Artist at Harriet Tubman Middle School in Crown Heights. Kids that have been labeled “At Risk.” I mean, I have even had to go into my own Pocket to get Supplies for my Students...

ARLENE	Hey Nola, How you doing?

NOLA	Good, How you doin’ today Arlene?


JAMIE	Horrible. But I like your Commitment.

NOLA	Thanks....And in all honesty, Harriet Tubman Elementary is seriously underfunded by the Department Of Ed. Because Art is just not a priority for these black and brown Kids at Tubman. And why do we think that is? Take a guess.

REGGIE	Thank you, Miss Darling.

NOLA	You got it. Thing is, there's this project that I assigned to my Students: I wanted them to recreate Album Covers that they thought depicted their Life Stories.
JAMIE	Ok. I like that.

NOLA	One that stood out to me though, was by this young Girl, named Reggie. She recreated Lil Kim’s Hard Core promo poster and put herself in the same provocative pose. She is a gifted Artist but she is only 12-Years-Old.

JAMIE	Life is severe in The Hood.

NOLA	Yeah I guess.

JAMIE	It only takes one great teacher to impact a life. Reggie is a very lucky girl.

NOLA	Really?

JAMIE	What?

NOLA	That little routine again?

JAMIE	What? You know I don’t smoke Cheeba. I mean, yes... I will let you give me a Shotgun.

NOLA	It's the same damn thing, Jamie.

JAMIE	No, it's not.

NOLA	Yes it is. And why you keep calling Weed Cheeba? It’s Kush. Trees.

JAMIE	I Love your Passion for Life.

NOLA	You say that like a Man who has been deprived of it.

JAMIE	I plead the Fifth, your Honor.

JAMIE	You know I stopped Smokin’ Weed for the last twenty years? I grew up in Howard Projects. Brownsville.

NOLA	I didn’t know that.

JAMIE	They used to call my... They used to call my building Little Beirut... A fucking war zone. Yeah, Fifteen-Seventy-Two (1572) East New York Ave. Dudes be getting Murked everyday for drugs, money. Over Real Estate they didn't even own, you know, stupid Shit. And I had to Fight everyday because, you know, Dudes be testing me. I won those Fights and I won their Respect. I'm Sorry Babe. Sometimes I feel like a walking Time-Bomb of Un-Detonated memories.

NOLA	What does that mean?

JAMIE	It means my Son Virgil goes to one of the best Prep Schools in the Country. Heights Prep in Brooklyn Heights. I mean teachers there, they don't have to come Out-of-Pocket because they lack the supplies. I just wanted to say that I empathize with you and your kids because I grew up in that world and I don't want my son to be a part of that. And I believe Virgil understands that, too. He is an amazing Student, you know. Straight As across the board. 'Cause his Mom and I are paying Big Bucks to ensure his place at the Top.


JUDITH	Hey, are you still up for Lunch with me and Kirk at Walter’s? It's my treat...

CHERYL	No Judith. Not today. I'm sorry Kirk.

KIRK	I'm sorry too.

JUDITH	Sorry, Cheryl.

JAMIE	I mean, I don't mean to brag but that boy, he's going to do Big Things in Life. He is a Natural Born Leader. All the Kids look up to him in Heights Prep: The White Kids, Hispanic, Asian too... even the older Students. My son Virgil, he is a Winner.

NOLA	You want to get that?

JAMIE	Nah, it’s probably Phil and Don at The Firm, wondering how long is my extended Lunch. Just trying to break my balls, they’ll be fine. I want to see you again, soon.

NOLA	I think you should check it.

JAMIE	I think you're trying to get rid of me.

NOLA	Never!

JAMIE	Shit.

NOLA	What’s wrong?

JAMIE	I have a Family Emergency I got to deal with right now.

NOLA	Oh, okay. Text me later if you can.

JAMIE	Shit.

NOLA	Oh shit, I got to go too.

MAN	Yeah, what's your name?


SHEMEKKA	Hum, Shemekka. I have an appointment with Lady Maye.

MAN	Okay, get to it.

LADY MAYE	I'm Lady Maye.

SHEMEKKA	Hi.

LADY MAYE	You got the Money? Here, count this. You can put your jacket and purse there.

MAN	All here. I'll wait outside.

LADY MAYE	Pants off. Lie down. Hold your hand up.

SHEMEKKA	What's that?

LADY MAYE	Hydrocodone. Help it go down smooth.

SHEMEKKA	Ooh! That's cold!

LADY MAYE	It's just alcohol.

SHEMEKKA	Is this gonna hurt?

LADY MAYE	No, you won’t feel a thing. Wake up the hole damn neighborhood.

SHEMMEKA	You told me that this wasn't gonna hurt.

LADY MAYE	Pretty hurts. Just relax. You scream like a little bitch.


CHERYL	The Sins of The Hood visited to the next Generation, Jamie.

JAMIE	What the Hell is that supposed to mean, What are you trying to say, Cheryl?

CHERYL	I’m saying this is your Fault. This is your Hood Rat Genes coming out in my Virgil.

JAMIE	Ah, here we go again. This is your, this is your Default Position Cheryl... Things go Wrong you blame Jamie. Right?

CHERYL	I don’t like what’s happening to my Virgil. So yes, that’s how I Feel.

JAMIE	You’re Virgil? He’s my son too. You know, that’s the problem, you’re always coddling him. Trying to make him into a Mama’s Boy! Always sending him away to Sag Harbor to spend the hole Summer. Well I mean, me and your Pops we be Cool, we’re post up, but your Mom who Low-Key Hates My Guts.

CHERYL	Stop talking so Ghetto: “Low Key This, Post Up That.” You’re not in Projects anymore, so stop Talking so ignorant. You are a most articulate Man. I hate it when you slip back in to Rachet-Speak. You know why? Because I don’t want my Virgil talking like that. I don’t want him to struggle like you did.

JAMIE	Hey! Don’t get it Twisted. I was Born into the Struggle. So was our son.

CHERYL	Just because you don't like to hear it coming out of my mouth, doesn't mean it's not true.

JAMIE	You don't look for solutions, just problems.

CHERYL	We need to find a solution. Virgil's trying to be something he's not. He's acting all hood, trying to get his Brownsville on, imitating you.

JAMIE	The boy doesn't know who he is, it's because you're raising him like race doesn't matter. Okay, he might be light skinned like you but the boy's black.

CHERYL	Are you telling me I don't know how to raise my black son? Virgil can see you're half way out the door.

JAMIE	Cheryl, you pushed me out. You got me sleeping in the fucking basement.

CHERYL	Because you're fucking other women!

JAMIE	We fell out, okay. We can't hide it.

CHERYL	How do you think our son is taking it? By putting on a modern age menstrual show. I've been doing everything I can to figure out how to be separated and still live under the same roof. But it's taking it's tole on Virgil. We at least have to be a united front, for him.

JAMIE	Cheryl, I'm here, aren't I? I'm here.

CHERYL	This video is Virgil crying out for our attention.

JAMIE	Yeah, well you best believe I'ma talk to him.

CHERYL	What is that? One of your new Colognes? I don’t like it.

JAMIE	It’s called Ocean Wave.

CHERYL	The Hell is that supposed to mean? Are you trying to be Cryptic?

JAMIE	If I was, would you even care? We’re going to be late.

CHERYL	Did any other Parents complain about the outrageousness of this Music Video?

GORDON	The other Parents never called me. You and your Husband are the only ones to take issue with this.

JAMIE	You know, I almost think that you don’t understand the gravity of this situation Mr. Howard. My Wife and I aren't paying this Elite School Forty-Five Thousand dollars ($45,000) a year to see our Son degrade himself using the word Nigger and to see other White and non Black Students use an Incendiary and Dangerous Epithet so freely.

GORDON	It was an assignment --

JAMIE	An assignment?

GORDON	Virgil and his Classmates were given a Class assignment to create something that would go Viral and their Music Video did just that! Their ni… “N-word for Luv” Music Video has racked up over than five-hundred thousand (500 000) YouTube views.

JAMIE	You know, I wonder if the other parents would have felt it was an Issue if this Song was entitled Kikes For Love? Or Chinks for Love? Or Micks For Love? Or Spics For Love? Pollocks for Love? Spaghetti benders for love. Red Skins for love? Or even Faggots For Love? Would they pivot on their opinion on just how vile this Song is?

CHERYL	Mr. Howard, I was just thinking. I have a former classmate of mine from Yale Lawschool, class of Two-Thousand-Two (2002)... and she is White, by the way... who is an esteemed Columnist for the New York Times. I wonder how she would frame this Story about Heights Prep’s subtle endorsement of White and Non- African American Students liberal use of the... Not even going to use the politically correct term “N” word, let's just call it what it is, the word Nigger, for a School project?


GORDON	Mr. and Mrs. Overstreet, you are absolutely, One-Hundred (100) percent right. I fell Asleep at The Wheel in my duties, here and I can only offer my own apology and an apology on behalf of Heights Prep. I will have the Nigger for love music video deleted immediately from YouTube and this kind of insensitivity will never happen again on my watch. You have my word. Oh, by the way, hum... My late father marched side by side with Dr. King in Selma, Alabama. Hashtag Black lives matter.

CHERYL	Thank you very much.

GORDON	Thank you.


RAQUELETTA MOSS	What are you doing here, Ms. Darling?

NOLA	What do you mean? You told me you wanted to meet with me at Three-thirty (3:30). It's 3:30, right? Oh, as a matter of fact, I am Ten Minutes early.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	You are 24 hours and Ten Minutes early, Ms. Darling. Our Meeting is not until tomorrow afternoon at 3:30.

NOLA	Can I have a seat, please?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Please be my guest.

NOLA	Thanks

RAQUELETTA MOSS	I know how it is when somebody got you Sprung. Trust me. But that ain’t none of my B.I.

NOLA	All due respect Ms. Moss, you’re right. That is none of your Business.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	I agree. But you know what is my B.I.? These Students and their personal welfare. That’s Raqueletta Moss’s B.I. I care about them.

NOLA	Are you saying I don’t care? Because I do. I care about these Students more than you know.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Ms. Darling, on the contrary. Raqueletta Moss knows that you care. Raqueletta Moss  admires your work and your Love for the Children. But you don’t know the level of Trauma... the level of Sexual Trauma some of these Students have experienced. But I... Excuse me... Raqueletta Moss knows that kind of Trauma. And Raqueletta Moss believes, despite your noble intentions, Miss Darling, that using Art to confront Personal Dysfunction is a Self-Fulfilling Defect. A Broken Record that never stops skipping. Do you mind if Raqueletta Moss shares something personal with you?

NOLA	Okay.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Raqueletta Moss comes from that same environment that Reggie was born into. Raqueletta Moss was one of those Chicken Heads Clucking, in the Back Rooms Fucking Grown-Ass Crack Monster Men, when she was just 13 years old. Raqueletta Moss is The Product of a cracked-out Single Mom who Pimped her overdeveloped Daughter in Dark Project Hallways. Raqueletta Moss was shuffled like a deck of Marked Cards in the Foster Care System. Raqueletta Moss Thanks GOD Everyday that she was adopted from a group home by Albert and Tina Lewis, who lived in Canarsie and put Raqueletta Moss on the Straight and Narrow. After graduating with her Masters in Education from L.I.U. on the corner of Dekalb and Flatbush across from Junior’s, Raqueletta Moss vowed to help Kids succeed with Love, Compassion and Discipline. Raqueletta Moss would like to  help Ms. Darling deepen her empathy for Students like Reggie, and realize that Emotional Scars are like Still Waters but they run Deeper Than Deep. Do you understand what Raqueletta Moss is... sorry. Do you understand what I am trying to say to you, Ms. Darling?

NOLA	I think I do. Quick question, do you often refer to yourself in the Third Person?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	We all have our ways of coping, Ms. Darling. Have a Good Afternoon.

VIRGIL	Did you and Mom really have to come to the School, Dad?

JAMIE	Son, the World is on Fire right now and that word you were using so carelessly--that word Nigger--it’s the Gasoline Igniting The Flames. There is nothing Cool about using that word, especially a young Black Man using it so freely around Young White Kids who have no Historical reference.


VIRGIL	Everyone calls each other Nigga at Heights Prep, whatever Race you are... It’s not a Big thing.

JAMIE	...But you don’t. I’ve taught you that word is not something to play with.

VIRGIL	We say it because We are Cool with each other. It’s all Love between us. My Generation is different.

JAMIE	...Different like that White boy Dylan StormRoof who, in Charleston, walked into Emmanuel AME Church and Murdered Nine Innocent People? Different like him? 'Cause he used that word, too. You’re too smart for this. I mean you are so talented with your Music... whose idea was this Video?

VIRGIL	It was just a Cool thing to do. I got Mad Views. I was recognizably Black for a change.

JAMIE	You are Black, Virgil. You don’t have to act no kind of way to prove it.

VIRGIL	I know, but my friends don’t.

JAMIE	Are your friends all that's important to you right now? 'Cause there’s something more important. These White and Asian kids at your school, are they down for you as you are for them?

VIRGIL	What do you care? You’re getting divorced and leaving, right?

JAMIE	Wait, hold up. Slow Ya Roll. Mind how you talking to me. I will never abandon you, Virgil. Never. You understand me? Do you understand me?

VIRGIL	I understand.

JAMIE	What’s happening between me and your Mom has nothing to do with you. Know that.

VIRGIL	You walk around the House like a Ghost. We don’t even play Madden anymore.

JAMIE	That’s because you kept whoopping my Butt at NBA2K.

VIRGIL	aYou told me I had to be 10 times better...

JAMIE	...Than your White friends, yeah, but you got to take it easy on your old man. I got arthritis.

VIRGIL	Dad?

JAMIE	Yeah?

VIRGIL	I don’t fit in at Heights Prep. I mean I do, but I don’t. You and Mom should have just sent me to Public School instead.

JAMIE	When I was at Private School, I felt like I didn’t belonged either. It was the same thing going home every day from School to the Projects. So I understand your Double Consciousness, living between both Worlds. But that’s what it’s like being Black in America today.

VIRGIL	Today? Dad, it’s always been like that.

JAMIE	That's why you don’t do what they do. You find Folks who do what you do. Alright?

VIRGIL	Alright.

JAMIE	You remember, I Love you sun. S-U-N, 'cause you shine like one.

VIRGIL	That’s Extra Cheesy, but thanks. I Love you too.

JAMIE	Cheesy, huh?

VIRGIL	Yeah.

JAMIE	Come on, let's go for a walk down by the promenade.

VIRGIL	Alright.


REGGIE	²Wow. Oh, look at this one.

NOLA	I love this, these brush strokes.

REGGIE	Oh, those are so nice. I like the dots of paint over here. This one's so cool, I love this one. Oh man, this is even better. This Work it's so Dope. I Love it.

NOLA	You have real Talent, Reggie. I mean it, you have this ability to take your Inner Voice and blast it on speaker phone through your Images and your Art. You know, the Terminology of the words Bitch, Slut, Hoe... as Cool as it may seem that you can re-purpose them to empower you, it doesn’t actually increase your Currency in the World. In fact, if you’re not careful, it can...

REGGIE	I already know what you’re going to say, alright? It can cheapen my own personal value. That’s if I let it. Don’t you know that I know that girls like Nicki Minaj, and Amber Rose are playing a Role? I’m not Stupid. Men call them Sluts, Ho’s, every Dirty thing you can name, yet Nicki and Amber have damn near 75 million Followers on Instagram combined. Being a Ho can be a Great Business.

NOLA	Do you understand what you are saying?

REGGIE	Yeah I understand what I am saying. This is America. That’s what works for them. That's not what works for me, though. Thank you Miss Darling for the books. See you in class next week.

NOLA	Okay.


SHEMEKKA	Hola Nola. How you (za)?

NOLA	You know, staying Black, Staying Alive.

SHEMEKKA	Hey honey, why don’t you go to bed.

NADIA	Alright mommy.

SHEMEKKA	Okay. Gonna be right over there to tuck you in.


NADIA	Don’t take long mommy.


SHEMEKKA	I wont, just gonna finish talking to God Mommy Nola.

NADIA	Hurry up, mommy.

NOLA	Oh my goodness. That's your butt, now?


SHEMEKKA	Evidently. She's been screaming to get out.

NOLA	I don’t even know what to say.

SHEMEKKA	Say Congratulations.

NOLA	Congratulations. What does Nadia think?

SHEMEKKA	She thinks that it' s pretty like Niki.

NOLA	Thank you Mr. Overstreet. Wow!

ELLA	Nola! I slid your mail under the door.

NOLA	Thank you Miss Ella. Con Ed got no love for starving artists. They will cut your shit off. Fuck.


RAQUELETTA MOSS	Dear Ms. Nola Darling. Sister, I want to give you a chance, as I Feel You have a real purpose. Let’s work together to Serve these Students. As my Personal Role Model, The First African-American Woman elected to Congress and the First African-American Woman to run for President of The United States of America, the Late Great Shirley Chisholm from B.K once said, “Service is the Rent you pay for room on this Earth.”


NOLA	Raqueletta Moss speaks in the third person, because she survived her own personal Holocaust by stepping out of her Body and saying, “I am not here, I am not here. You can not hurt me, because Raqueletta Moss is not here.”


RAQUELETTA MOSS	To quote one of Brooklyn’s Finest, The Late Notorious B.I.G, “And if you don't know, now you know.” Don’t let me down, my Sister. Sincerely, Ms. Raqueletta Moss.”
