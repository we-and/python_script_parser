Radio	It's a beautiful day out there, hope you are enjoying the weather. But I have bad news from our KCDF weather center. They're telling me there's a major storm front on the way, but I'm sure it's gonna pass and soon we'll be back to our beautiful California weather. 

Radio	As temperatures continue to spike downwards, federal agencies have yetto release official fatality data in connection with the weather changes. Mandatory evacuation measures have been implemented

Helen	There's still no answer.

Mark	I'm sure Brie is fine.

Helen	Mark, we haven't heard from her in two days.

Mark	She'll be okay. Brie's smart. Sometimes I think she's smarter than her parents. Okay, well, maybe not smarter than you.

Helen	Yeah, right.

Helen	Oh! Faster, Mark!

Mark	Yeah.

Helen	Faster! Mark!

Mark	Hang on!

Helen	Look out! Over there!

Mark	Hold on! Piece of cake.

Brie	What?

Tyler	Nothing. All good.

Brie	GPS is down. Storm tracker's down.

Tyler	Well, good news.  Storm's still here. No need to track it.

Brie	Just keep driving.  Oh, we're in the middle of a whiteout. Let me try and see if I can get more of a signal.

Tyler	Brie! Whoa!

Brie	Sorry.

Tyler	What are you doing?

Brie	We only have a few more hours to get to my parents! We need to give them this data! There's no one else in the storm that's gonna help us! They're all

Tyler	More safe in a bunker underground?

Brie	I mean, it's gotta. Just you and me. We're gonna save the world.

Tyler	Yay. We get to fight a huge storm.

Brie	Oh, no, look!

Tyler	Are you all right?

Brie	Yeah. Can you reverse the car?

Tyler	All right. No.

Brie	It's collapsing! What'll we do?

Tyler	Open the door! Slowly!

Brie	It's not working! I'll try the window!

Tyler	Go! Go! Take the phone, here. I'm coming!

Brie	What is it? Come on!

Tyler	My foot, it's...I'm stuck!

Brie	Get a knife from the console! Come on!

Tyler	I got it!

Brie	Come on! Come on! You got this. Come on, this way.

Tyler	Are you sure we're going in the right direction?

Brie	Yeah. Only a few more miles. We've got be be closer. I just need to find reception.

Tyler	I don't think we need that phone to know a storm is coming.

Brie	We'll be inside soon. In the meantime, we just need to figure out the storm information as soon as possible so we can...

Tyler	So we can what? Beat this thing? Fine. I mean, the entire world is on lockdown. But you and I, we're gonna solve this problem with a smartphone from Wal-Mart.

Brie	Hey, I didn't ask you to come with me.

Tyler	I know. I'm sorry. It's just freaking me out, the storm, the whiteout, all of it. People are dying, the world is dying. It's a lot.

Brie	I know.

Tyler	You promise to save the world?

Brie	I promise. It's from Best Buy.

Tyler	What?

Brie	I bought the phone from Best Buy.

Tyler	I hope the warranty is still good. What are you doing?

Brie	Here. I am trying to find a signal. There's a break in the mountains here!

Tyler	How can you tell?

Tyler	This isn't a wolf's natural habitat. Migration patterns must be changing. Well, I gotta put y environmental science degree to some good use, huh?

Brie	I knew I brought you along here for a good reason.

Tyler	It wasn't just the witty banter and charming personality?

Brie	No. 

Tyler	We gotta go. Come on.

Brie	Hey! Hey! Hello!

Tyler	Hey, down here!

Brie	Down here! Hello? Damn it!

Tyler	We gotta go. We gotta go. What?

Brie	This isn't a field.

Tyler	It's a lake. Do you think it's frozen solid?

Brie	Seems to be. It's still our best direct route. Let's just take it slow.

Tyler	Okay. What is that?

Brie	Tyler?

Tyler	Oh...

Brie	What is it?

Tyler	Come on.

Brie	Ah!

Tyler	Oh! Are you okay?

Brie	Yeah.

Tyler	Maybe we can take a quick break.

Brie	No, no. We need to get inside. Look, I know we're building up a sweat, but the temperature's dropping as it gets darker. It's dropping fast.

Brie	Wait. Did you hear that?

Tyler	Yeah.

Brie	They're all around us. Do we run?

Tyler	No, no, no. Move slow. If we run, they'll chase us.

Brie	Okay. There! We need to get there! Come on!

Tyler	I'm just gonna go check over here. Brie! I think I found a way inside. It looks like a camp, or a school.

Brie	Okay, I'm going to try my folks again and let them know where we are.

Helen	Hello? Brie?

Brie	Mom? Dad? Can you guys hear me?

Helen	Hello, Brie! Honey, we're here!

Brie	Mom! Dad?

Mark	We can hear you, Brie! We can hear you, sweetheart!

Brie	I've been trying to get hold of you. But even with the satellite phone, the storm has been keeping me from getting a signal.

Helen	Tell us where you are, honey. Are you close?

Brie	Tyler and I were coming back from our trip. But the car got stuck and they closed the roads. It's okay. We found shelter at this community college.

Helen	Community college?

Brie	Listen. I don't have much time. I think I might lose connection to the satellite. But I think I've perfected the remote sensor prototype from your research notes.

Helen	But that schematic was months off.

Brie	But I think I should be able to gather the weather patterns and calculate the algorithms faster than anything else I've been able to come up with. But in order to take the readings, I need to take them somewhere where I can access the satellite while still avoiding interference from the storms.

Mark	Then we're coming to get you.

Brie	But, Dad

Mark	What's the college, Brie? What's the name of the college?

Brie	It's Red Community lege.

Helen	Brie? Can you repeat that? We couldn't make it out.

Brie	Red Community College.

Helen	Brie?

Brie	Dad? Dad? Are you there? Mom? Dad? 

Helen	Brie!

Brie	Careful. I've been hearing dangerous things other than the storms.

Helen	Brie! Brie!

Brie	Hello? Dad? Dad? Are you there?

Mark	It's okay, it's okay. We're gonna find her, I promise.

Brie	Hello? Dad? Damn it!

Mark	Larry?

Larry	Yeah?

Mark	Oh, there you are.

Larry	Hey, Mark.

Mark	Hey, good to see you.

Larry	Yeah, you too.

Mark	Love the décor.

Larry	Yeah. I call it arctic doomsday chic with a hint of lavender. Hey, Helen.

Helen	Hi, Larry.

Larry	Hi.

Helen	It's not looking so good, is it?

Larry	No. We lost the generators about an hour ago. And, even worse, we're down about three degrees across the board.

Helen	Three overnight?

Mark	Larry, where are those maps?

Larry	Maps? Like paper maps?

Mark	With GPS and cell towers down, we gotta go back to the basics.

Larry	I don't know. They're somewhere over there. 

Mark	Yeah.

Larry	Yeah, look. I think we've reached the point of no return.

Helen	The final cold snaps coming in, these storms are only gonna get worse.

Larry	Yeah.

Helen	What are you gonna do?

Larry	I'm all packed. I'm heading to the air force base. I'm hoping that my family's there. More importantly, the military has set up a communications array. We've been talking to scientists all over the world. But the problem is we don't have enough data. We just don't understand these storms!  We can't figure out

Mark	Found them!

Larry	What are you doing?

Mark	Brie is trapped with her boyfriend, Tyler. We have to get them.

Larry	Okay. Where are they?

Helen	At a community college. 

Larry	Which community college?

Mark	Red...

Larry	Red Community College?

Helen	It can't be far from where they were going on their trip.

Mark	How many colleges can have the word Red in the name?

Helen	Here! Here! Redwoods Community College! That has to be it!

Mark	Mm-hmm. Okay, see that main road right there? We can take that and, even if it gets rough, we'll make it with the truck.

Larry	Then what are you gonna do?

Mark	We'll meet you at the air force base, but we have to get them.

Larry	All right. You guys give 'em hell, okay?

Helen	We'll see you soon... somehow.

Larry	Yeah. You save those kids. Hey, by the way, you know what? You should take whatever you want from the lab, anything that you think is gonna help you.

Mark	Okay, Larry. Thanks. See you later. All right. See what you can find in here. And I'm gonna take a look around and see what else we can get.

Helen	You mean steal?

Mark	It's not stealing. I'm the boss.

Helen	Okay, boss. Okay, this'll help.

Mark	How's this for prepared?

Badger	TAC, Badger. How do you hear me?

TAC	Badger, TAC, your signal is weak but readable. I say again, your signal is weak but readable.

Badger	Copy. Probably the storm. Descending to . We have visual on what looks to be recent movement on the ground. Require permission to investigate for survivors.

TAC	 Stand by Badger, that is a negative.  You are to return to base due to inclement weather. I say again, you are to return to base due to inclement weather.

Badger	TAC, we have confirmed visual on what appears to be  survivors. Acknowledge, we have confirmed visual on survivors. Request permission to check low at Tango .

TAC	 Roger, Badger, I say again, negative. Return to base. Immediate execute, return to base.

Badger	Unable, TAC. Unable. Out.  Badger, what's our play?

Badger	I'm going on, the rest of you are free to head back. We're with you, sir.

Badger	All right, men, let's go.

Brie	Excuse me, sir?

Teacher	You're too late. Goodbye.

Larry	No. No!

Brie	Sorry if my hands are cold.

Tyler	Cold hands, warm heart.

Brie	Yuck. Would you like some wine with some of that cheese?

Tyler	How's it looking out there?

Brie	Well, the teacher left.

Tyler	Left? What do you mean, left?

Brie	Tyler, he just walked out.

Tyler	Uh, yeah. Things aren't great. We're almost out of supplies. It's just about all gone. There's only enough food to last us a few more days.

Brie	The others need to know.

Tyler	Brie, these kids got left here, trapped. We have no idea what to do.

Brie	Kids? They're like two years younger than us.

Tyler	And if we hadn't shown up, who knows what kind of shape they'd be in? Did you get hold of your parents? 

Brie	Yeah, but I could barely hear them over the cloud cover. They said that they were on their way to help us.

Tyler	Your dad won't let anything get in the way of saving his daughter. I'm sorry our trip got cut short. I was having a great time.

Brie	Me too. But, Tyler, we need to help these kids. 

Tyler	Oh, kids? They're kids now?

Brie	Tyler...we need to help them.

Tyler	Brie, everyone out there is on the edge right now. If we tell them that we're about out of supplies... Some of them are liable to go off the deep end.

Brie	Then we'll tell them help is on the way. 

Brie	My parents should be here soon. Hopefully, they can get the van running and we'll be out of here soon.  Look, I know it sucks and I know you're all scared. So am I. But what we have to do now is... 

Roger	Uh, excuse me? I don't remember anyone electing you as spokesman or leader or whatever the hell it is you think you are now!

Aliyah	Roger, don't.

Roger	Besides... You don't even go to school here.

Brie	No one elected anyone to do anything. Tyler and I are just trying to...

Roger	We have a van out there. we just need to get it running.

Tyler	That's enough.

Brie	Tyler... I got this. So, Roger, right? Am I pronouncing that right, Roger? So what's your plan?

Roger	Hey, you're the one who appointed yourself.  You tell me...

Brie	No, go on. You're in charge now.  So do you have the mechanical ability to get the van running?

Roger	That's not what I'm talking about. What... 

Brie	And once you get it running, do you know how to clear the roads and figure out what to do next and where to go?

Roger	Okay

Tyler	Yeah, we feel it.

Roger	What's happening?

Brie	I don't know, but I don't think it's gonna be anything good.

Aliyah	Guys?

Tyler	Is it an earthquake?

Brie	Not an earthquake!

Aliyah	Hey, guys!What's happening?

Tyler	Oh, everyone inside now! Get down! Get down!

Aliyah	What? What's happening?

Tyler	Everyone get down and take cover!

Aliyah	Guys, what's happening? Ah!

Tyler	Get down!

Brie	Aliyah!

Tyler	Aliyah! Take my hand!

Brie	Aliyah!

Tyler	Take it.

Tyler	I think it's stopping.

Brie	Aliyah, Aliyah, are you okay?

Tyler	Aliyah, I think it's over, I think it's over now.

Brie	You're okay. Roger!

Tyler	Help! Pull her out! Pull her out!

Aliyah	Oh! Ah!

Radio	Reports have been coming in from London, England and Paris, France. Communications have been spotty. We know these storms are hitting worldwide. We have reports from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Destruction on a scale we have never seen before. All modes of public transportation are closed after countless trains have derailed. I'll stay on the air as long as possible. But for right now all I can tell you is find shelter and stay indoors. And may God help us all.

Helen	We're staying ahead of the worst of it pretty well. Should have a gap of a couple of hours before it hits us.

Mark	Yeah. We should be at the college within an hour if conditions stay the same.

Helen	Hey! Hey, look at this!

Mark	I'm kind of driving.

Helen	Right. Sorry. Listen then. There's a strange anomaly not too far from here.

Mark	Anomaly?

Helen	Yeah. It doesn't seem to be affected by the storms.

Mark	Are you sure it's not a malfunction or the satellite being affected by the weather?

Helen	It might be, but if it's not... Mark! Slow down!

Tyler	Hello! Anyone in there? 

Woman	Yes! Thank God! Please help us! We can't get out!

Mark	Okay, hold tight! We're gonna try to pull you out!

Aliyah	Oh!

Brie	Sorry.

Aliyah	It's okay, okay. Thank you.

Brie	You're gonna be fine, okay? You'll be back to class in no time.

Aliyah	You know, I think school might be canceled for a little bit.

Brie	So how long have you been going to school here?

Aliyah	Two years. I get my certificate in administrative support in the fall.

Brie	Nice!

Aliyah	Thanks. It's just a secretarial degree. Do you go to school?

Brie	Graduated, but I go back to grad school soon. How did that feel?

Aliyah	It's okay. Can I take it down?

Brie	Damn.

Tyler	Yeah. These doors have seen better days.

Brie	Well, let's try and get them open.

Roger	You sure about that?

Brie	We still need to get out of here. All right. Give me a boost.

Tyler	Yeah?

Tyler	What do you see?

Brie	Nothing. We're completely trapped.

Roger	God! Are you kidding me? We're trapped in here?

Brie	Well, that's not our only problem.

Roger	What is, then?

Brie	When help arrives, how do they know how to get us?

Roger	How can you stay so calm?

Brie	Well, I was raised by a couple of scientists. I was raised to think analytically and assess situations before panicking. But, yeah, we do need to hurry.

Tyler	Well, my parents only taught me how to change my oil.

Brie	Well, that's handy too.

Roger	God...

Brie	Look, let's not panic just yet. Maybe let's split up. You know, find any other exits and windows and see if there's another way out.

Roger	And if there isn't?

Mark	You able to put it in neutral?

Woman	Hang on! Okay, got it!

Mark	Okay! Hold on! We're gonna try to pull you out!

Boy	Mommy, I'm scared.

Woman	It's okay, baby.

Helen	Sure this is gonna work?

Mark	It'll work, it'll work. Start it up. Give it everything it's got.

Helen	Come on, come on!

Mark	Keep going. All the way down. Floor it. Keep going. Don't stop. It's working! Yes. Come on! Come on! Good job. Good job.

Woman	You two saved our lives. Thank you so much!

Mark	Where are you headed?

Woman	Mathers Air Force Base. The bunkers are there. Is that where you guys are headed? 

Mark	No. We gotta find our daughter.  She's at Redwoods Community College.

Woman	Oh. That's only a few miles down the mountain,  the first building at the entrance.

Mark	Well, we both better get a move on if we want to reach our destinations before the storm hits.

Woman	Okay. Are you sure you don't wanna go to the bunkers? You guys gotta get to safety before it gets too crazy to be out here.

Helen	Yeah, we're sure. We gotta get going. I mean, get your son to safety.

Mark	Watch those icy patches, okay? There's still time to drive safely, but you need to leave right now.

Woman	We will. Thank you so much. What do you say, baby?

Boy	Thank you.

Mark	You're welcome, buddy. Take care of your mom.

Woman	Be safe.

Helen	Let's get going.

Brie	Where do we find that? Do they have a gym here?

Tyler	Do I look like I go to school here?

Brie	Well, maybe in the teacher's lounge or...

Tyler	I doubt we'll find one in the teacher's lounge. I've lost ground visual. Descending to three thousand. Copy. Descending to three thousand.

Snoopy	Badger, I'm picking up intermittent heat signals on infrared.

Badger	Copy, Snoopy. Let's move in for a closer look. Could be survivors. Descending to two thousand. Looks like we've got some heavy cloud cover. Snoopy, I've got multiple bogies on my .

Snoopy	Badger, do you have visual?

Badger	Negative, Snoopy. Check your high low, everyone. Anyone have a visual? I've got bogeys on my screen as well.

Larry	Hey! Shouldn't we have visual? Clouds aren't that thick. Doesn't make any sense. Stay on course,  it's gotta be the storm screwing with our instruments.

Snoopy	I can't see crap in this. If our instruments are giving false echoes, we need to abort, Badger.

Badger	Roger that. Wait, what's that? Badger! Badger is down. I say again, Badger is down. TAC! Mayday, mayday, mayday!

Snoopy	This is Snoopy. We have lost Badger. Request

Brie	So now we're really sealed off from everything. This ice has got to be at least six feet thick.

Aliyah	Maybe we can build a fire and burn our way through. We have scraps. We can use those as kindling?
 
Tyler	I doubt we can make a fire thick enough to break through this ice. Then it will take, what,  hours?
 Brie	And we don't have anywhere near that kind of time.

Aliyah	There's gotta be something in here we can useto dig our way out.

Tyler	We haven't searched everywhere in the building. Still some time left. Take a break and come up with a plan.

Roger	You don't get it!

Tyler	Dude, what is your deal?

Brie	Calm down!

Roger	We don't have any time at all. Who knows when another avalanche may come right on top of us, maybe even a bigger one!

Tyler	That's enough.

Roger	We need to do something now!

Brie	What is that?

Tyler	Where'd you get that from?

Roger	I found this in the janitor's closet along with some tanks of propane. Stack them up against the doors and use this to set them off!

Tyler	You have been watching way too many shark movies.

Roger	We blow it up so you can get the van running. If not, we start walkingto find help.

Brie	I know it looks pretty bad. But I don't think it's a good idea to blow up our only shelter from the inside!

Roger	Look, I just can't be in here anymore.

Brie	Look, the avalanche hasn't buried the roof yet. We still have that beacon up there.

Roger	Stupid beacon!

Brie	Yeah, stupid beacon, but it's big enough to be seen from miles off. And we were saving it for last resort.

Roger	So how long are we gonna wait?

Brie	Look, all I'm asking for is two hours. I'll go up to the roof, light the beacon and, if no one comes within two hours, then fine. Explode away.

Tyler	Brie, are you sure about this?

Brie	Of course, I'm not sure, but I think we're running out of options. Do you have any ideas? Two hours?

Roger	Two hours.

Brie	Tyler, help me with the beacon.

Tyler	You got it.

Mark	It's picking up out there. We still doing good?

Helen	I'd say we got about an minute buffer. But, Mark, the anomaly isn't going away. I don't think it's a glitch. I think it might be real.

Mark	Where is it?

Helen	Just a few miles east of the school.

Mark	Damn it! We got a flat tire. I'm gonna go take a look. I'll make this quick.

Helen	Mark? Mark! Mark, hurry up!

Tyler	All right.

Brie	Okay, hit it with the lighter fluid. There you go.

Tyler	I hope it works.

Brie	Me too, but I don't want to have to let Roger blow up the building.

Tyler	It's actually kind of romantic. I was gonna wait until we got to the cabin, but this seems like a better time than ever. Brie Jacobs, will you marry me?

Brie	Absolutely!

Helen	That has to be it! The plateau!

Mark	Hands on the wheel! I don't get it. Why would a plateau not be affected by the storm?

Helen	It must interrupt the flow of the weather. The shape and the altitude create a pocket where the storms just go around and over it, thus leaving the area protected from the elements. It's like, um... It's like a concrete post in a river. It just diverts the current around it.

Mark	And over it?

Helen	Do you want to argue with what we're seeing? Whoa! Oh, I wasn't ready for that one.

Mark	It's getting insane out here even more than before, I mean. I got more bad news for you.

Helen	What? We're losing ground?

Mark	I don't think we're losing ground. I think the storm is picking up speed.

Helen	I think if we can just get Brie's device to that plateau, we can get the data that we need to send back to Larry and the military to learn how to deal with these storms!

Mark	The world's never gonna be the same. We can't stop this.

Helen	No, but with that data, we can learn to adapt as a species. Just wish we had any idea where we are right now, how close we are to the college! It's just white out!

Mark	We should be here.  I don't understand. If I just had a landmark, something would help!  Anything, rock slides or...  look out there in the distance.

Helen	Is that the school?

Mark	Good job, Brie.

Brie	Here. Drink something.

Aliyah	Thank you.

Brie	Stop looking at the time. I know I'm on the clock.  How are you doing?

Aliyah	I've been better.

Brie	We're gonna get out of here soon.

Tyler	We turned the place upside down. Couldn't find anything that would make a difference. No knives, nothing we can pry loose and use a makeshift pickax. Roger, I don't suppose you'd be willing to give us an extension?

Roger	Sorry, guys. We made a deal. I expect to be taking care of some ice pretty soon enough.  Just all at once.

Tyler	You just wanna use that gun, huh?

Roger	I'm just excited to get outta here one way or another.

Brie	Did you guys hear that?

Roger	I didn't hear anything.

Brie	It's getting cold. Let's bunker down and conserve some heat before my mom and dad get here.

Helen	This is insane.

Mark	Just keep your eyes peeled for a way in.

Helen	Stop! Stop! Stop! I see something. It's small, but I think I can fit.

Mark	Good eye!

Helen	Yeah.

Mark	Most importantly, take one of these.

Helen	If she's in there...

Mark	If she's in there, you'll find her and you'll find a safe way out. Just focus on that. We don't have much time.  Try to use the hammer to break up some of the blockages, okay? And hurry up. We don't have a lot of time. I love you.

Helen	I love you.

Brie	Mom? Dad? It has to be them!

Helen	Oh!

Helen	I'm in. I'm in.

Mark	That's great, honey. Okay, radio me as soon as you find anything, get back out here as soon as you can.

Helen	Nice doggie...

Helen	Scientist one, wolf nothing.

Tyler	No.

Brie	It's okay.

Helen	Anyone want a ride?

Brie	Mom!

Helen	Oh, thank God! I knew you'd be okay when I saw that signal fire.

Tyler	No one would have thought of that but Brie. Am I wrong, Mrs. Jacobs?

Helen	Tyler, I think you definitely have to call me Helen. Oh, okay. So maybe you should start me calling me Mom from now on.

Helen	Okay. Hey, I found everyone! Brie and Tyler are here with some others.

Mark	That's great. We might have another problem!

Helen	What do you mean, the crack is gone?
 
Mark	The rubble shifted, sealing it off! You're gonna have to find another way out before this storm hits.

Helen	Any ideas?

Brie	Maybe. Dad? Hello? Are you there?

Mark	I'm here, sweetie! You okay?

Brie	I'm fine, Dad. It's good to hear your voice.

Mark	You too. Everything going okay in there? You guys need to hustle your way out here. This storm is gonna be bad news for everyone.

Brie	We're working on it. Should just be a few more minutes. 

Mark	Shake a leg, hon.

Brie	Hey, Dad, what side of the wall are you on?

Mark	East. Why?

Brie	Just making sure you're clear of the blast radius. It shouldn't be an issue.

Mark	Blast radius? Brie...?
 
Brie	No, we've got it all under control. It's fine...I think. Brie out.

Mark	Brie? Hello? Brie? Have kids, they said. It'll be fun and fulfilling, they said.

Roger	You sure about this?

Tyler	Don't back down now, man. You got this.

Roger	A lot that can go wrong here if it blows in the wrong direction.

Tyler	Yeah, but we're kind of out of options. You got this one.

Roger	This is crazy. This is crazy.

Tyler	Get down. Get down. Here we go.

Roger	It worked!

Brie	Dad, we're heading out!

Mark	I'm on my way!

Tyler	Van's ready. How's your leg?

Aliyah	It hurts, but it's okay. I can make it.

Tyler	All right.

Aliyah	Oh, guys, we're gonna go home!

Mark	Hey, Brie? What do you say we go to college here next year?

Brie	Yeah, I'm really excited for grad school.

Roger	Hey, thanks for saving us.

Mark	It wasn't me. It was Tyler.

Tyler	Yeah, you guys are all set? Van just had a loose battery wire. I told you my parents taught me a little something about cars. I'm, uh, gonna make sure we didn't leave anything.

Roger	I think my gunplay days are over. The van's all loaded up? Routed to Mathers Air Force Base, right?

Helen	We're not, actually.

Roger	That's the only place that's safe. That's where we we're supposed to go when the roads are clear.

Helen	We need to take care of something.

Mark	You get yourself to Mathers Air Force Base. They'll take care of you.

Roger	Right. Good luck.

Mark	You too.

Brie	I'm gonna go help Tyler.

Helen	You saw? I thought you liked him.

Mark	I like him. I just don't want him to know I like him.

Mark	Oh, our little girl...
 
Helen	Oh, he's a good guy. She'll be happy, okay? Don't worry.

Larry	Get up. Come on, come on!

Larry	Now we're talking. All right, how hard can this be? Uh, air speed, altitude, fuel...fuel, right. Okay. Ignition. It worked! Air Force Base, here we come!

Tyler	An anomaly?

Brie	It makes total sense! The wind patterns are being diverted, creating an area safe from the weather.

Helen	Mm-Hmm. Yeah. It's like an oasis. The plateau's protected because of its position like the way air flows over an airplane wing.

Tyler	I'm not sure I understand.

Mark	You better get used to it, Tyler,  if you're gonna marry into a family of scientists. And congrats, by the way, but we're gonna have to celebrate later.

Helen	The plateau is not too far.

Brie	I can get the readingsand take them back to the scientific community.  Dad, can we get there?

Mark	Depends on the storm system. How bad is it?

Helen	As bad as it gets, but we're right on the edge of it, though. So we can stay in front of it if you can drive like hell.

Mark	I'll do my best.

Tyler	Mr. Jacobs? I mean...Dad? Mark. Just let me know if you need me to drive or...

Helen	Whoa! Engine trouble now?

Mark	I don't think it's engine trouble.  I think it's...

Brie	Oh, no! Look!

Helen	There! A side road down the hill!

Mark	I see it! Hold on! Hold on!

Brie	Mom?

Helen	It's okay.

Helen	Mark!

Mark	Hold on, guys!

Helen	Faster, Mark! Faster!
 
Mark	Okay. Okay.

Larry	Ah! Ah! Uh-oh. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

Brie	Looks like there are more storms on the way and they're growing.

Helen	The plateau won't stay protected.  Eventually, the storms will be too powerful if we don't get the data before that happens.

Mark	This truck isn't gonna make it. I don't care how good Tyler is with cars.

Tyler	What'll we do?

Mark	I have an idea.

Tyler	Oh, I know that sound. When's the last time you gave this thing some oil?

Mark	I think the transmission's blown, and not a minute too soon. There's the outpost. They decommissioned it before I took over. so I have no idea what's in there. Minimal power for automated experiments and data, but my key card should be able to get us in.

Helen	Well, it's better than nothing and we can come up with a plan.

Helen	Whoa, whoa! Explain to me what you think you're doing.

Mark	Look, if we don't go out there, they're gonna come in. Maybe we can reason with them.

Helen	Reason with them?

Mark	We don't have anything they want, but be ready.

Brie	Didn't take long for mankind to fall apart. Howdy.

Mark	Howdy.

Walter	Looks like you ran into a little bit of car trouble. Unfortunately, the local auto shop is closed for the season. Y'all should have stayed indoors today. There's some mighty ferocious weather coming.

Helen	Yeah, we were just passing through.  The car's busted.  Do you know where we could borrow a car?

Walter	Borrow?  Well, even if I did, I'm notreally much of a borrowing type. What's in the bag?

Brie	Nothing that should interest you.

Walter	Oh, you'd be surprised what interests me: stamps, English literature.  What's in your bag?

Mark	We don't have time for this! There's a storm coming, a massive one!

Walter	You are correct.

Mark	Look, I'm a scientist. We need to get to shelter!

Walter	I. Don't. Care. We're gonna take what we want, everything we want. And that'll be that. First, I'll be taking that gun I saw peeking out from under your coat. Now. Get the bag.

Tyler	Not. A. Chance. Run! Run!

Mark	Come on! Come on! Here's the door! You have to jump, honey! Come on! Yes, please! You have to jump!

Tyler	I'll catch you! We got this! Throw me the bag! Throw me the bag! Throw me the bag first! Come on!

Mark	Let's go!

Walter	Ah!

Brie	Tyler! No!
 
Helen	Sorry, but we have to go! We have to go.

Mark	Got it!

Mark	You doing okay?

Helen	I can't believe how close we came. The plateau, I could see it. It can't be less than five miles away. May as well be a thousand.

Mark	It's not over yet. We're still together, right?

Helen	We have a window, Mark. Can you believe it? In about five minutes, we could get out of here and be halfway to the plateau. But according to these readings, after that the storms are so strong that they could last for months. We're done. Mankind. Brie, me, you.

Mark	We're gonna figure something out.

Helen	Yeah, and even if we do, then what? We learn to live with these storms? What kind of life is that for us? For Brie? When the world's populated by people like those guys?

Mark	It's a life. That's what's important, right? We stay alive and we collect as much data as we can. And that might allow us the possibility to create the technology to divert these storm patterns, maybe even control and stop them. Who knows what mankind is gonna come up with? But you need to believe, Helen. You need to believe.

Helen	I love you.

Mark	I love you.

Helen	Hi, honey, how are you doing?

Mark	Hi, sweetheart.

Helen	We're so sorry. We're all gonna miss Tyler very much.

Mark	We know how much you loved him. I'm so sorry.

Helen	You missed one of your dad's motivational speeches.

Brie	Oh, did I?

Helen	Yeah. It was a pretty good one.

Mark	Motivational speeches always remind me of ur board members, Andrew Capello. Holy crap! Andrew Capello!

Brie	Dad!

Mark	Larry told me that Andrew parks his SUV up here! I don't know if he's trying to hide it from his wife or it's a tax thing. But I know he parks it in the storage building. There's got to be keys here somewhere!Got 'em!

Helen	That's not the storm.

Mark	Get ready to run for the car.

Brie	You killed him!

Helen	He'll get his.

Walter	You!

Helen	Brie, come on! It's the opening between the storms. It's not gonna last. We have to go.

Helen	Hmm.

Brie	Wait! What about Dad?

Helen	You should know your mother better than that, all right?  Get it started. We will be right out!

Mark	You need to stop this and just let us go, please! There are bigger things at stake! There are lives at stake!

Walter	Yack, yack, yack.

Helen	Hey! Nobody messes with my family! I found the back door. Come on.

Mark	Yeah.

Brie	Anybody need a ride?

Larry	Mathers Air Force Base, come in! Mathers Air Force Base!This is... me. Where are you? Mathers Air Force Base! Please come in! Mathers Air Force Base! Please reply! Unidentified aircraft, this is Mathers Air Force Base. Do you copy?

Larry	Hi! Hi! I mean, copy! Copy! Yeah! I'm trying to get to you. Where are you? Unidentified aircraft, we're gonna help you out. Do you copy? 
Larry	Copy that! Um, I might have a problem. My wings are freezing over. Mathers is straight ahead. Just keep your wings level and you should see the airfield any moment. Land on Runway Number Six.

Larry	I unders...Copy, copy. I understand. I can see the field. Think I can make it. Negative, aircraft! Wrong runway! Six! Runway six! Six!

Larry	Whoa! That wasn't so hard. Who needs a pilot's license?

Helen	Oh, the storm's right on top of us.

Brie	Everybody, hang on! I can do this. I can do this. I got this!

Helen	You're doing good, baby.

Brie	I got this! Come on!

Mark	Hold on.

Brie	I got this. I got this!

Mark	Keep going!

Brie	I can do this! I can do this! I can do this. I can do this, I can do this.

Mark	Good driving, Brie.

Brie	Thanks, Dad. Here goes nothing. Something's wrong. Needs more powerto push through!

Helen	May I see that?

Brie	Here. Mom, what are you doing?

Helen	If I wire this in series with my tracker, it should give us enough power, right? Okay.  All set. Try it now.

Brie	It's working! It's gathering the data any minute now... It's analyzing the systems! It worked!

Helen	I knew it would!

Mark	You did it, sweetie!

Brie	Transmitting!

Larry	They did it. They did it! Guys! Guys, they did it!

Brie	Look, even more safe zones are showing up!

Mark	The world will never be the same.

Helen	No, but we'll adapt. Society will have to change.

Brie	And we have hope.

Helen	Always.
