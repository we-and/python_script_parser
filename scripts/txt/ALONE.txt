(ALONE)
 

AIDAN	This is Aidan. It's day forty- two. I'm sorry. I tried. Hello? Hello?! Mmm, come to papa.

DISPATCHER	This message is being transmitted at the request of the Office of Civil Defense. This is an emergency broadcast. This isn't a test.
 
AIDAN	Jesus. Oh my God. Jeez.
 
LITTLE GIRL	Help me!

AIDAN	Hey! Hey, sweatheart! it's okay. I'm going to come get… Somebody's gonna come get… Whoa! No! Whoa! Hey! Hey! What's…

BRANDON	It's okay… No, no. Hey, hey, hey. I'm your neighbor!

AIDAN	Get…get out of my apartment!

BRANDON	I'm your neighbor! You know my face! Okay? You've seen me before. You know me! I live next door. I'm Brandon. Please… Please…

AIDAN	What are you doing in here?

BRANDON	The door was unlocked.

AIDAN	Yeah, why are you in my apartment? What…

BRANDON	Something's happening...

AIDAN	Yeah, no shit! Why are you in here?!
 
BRANDON	Are you alone?

AIDAN	Just what is going on?

BRANDON	My roommate attacked me. And I've known his since the fifth grade. Oh god! Oww!

NEWSCASTER	Major cities in complete chaos! Infected people are extremely dangerous! We're seeing bleeding from the eyes, screaming. We're also seeing cannibalism. The virus is being transmitted through the blood, primarily through bites and scratches. The amount of…

DISPATCHER	The following message is being transmitted at the request of the Office of Civil Defense.

BRANDON	I’m not that. I'm fine. I'm okay. Don't make me go out there. No!

AIDAN	I'm sorry.

BRANDON	I'll die!

AIDAN	I can't help you here. You have to leave. Dude!
 
BRANDON	No! No!

AIDAN	Get the hell out! Get out! Oh god. Go. Go!

REPORTER	We're starting to see some instances of groups of people…well, groups of people fighting back. We do not encourage this. Certainly, if you are attacked, you should defend yourself. But what we have seen so far, the best way to survive, to avoid infection, to avoid being a part of spreading the infection, is to just completely avoid contact. Find a place and stay there. Hopefully it won't have to be for too long.

OPERATOR	We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and...
 
AIDAN	What? What's happening?

DAD	I love that they put this guy in the lead-off spot. I mean, he hits everything. Look at him. They can't get the ball past him. On top of that, he hits for power. This is great.

NEWSCASTER TWO	So, in the absence of a biological imperative, we learned that there could be a psychological driver that makes infected people only willing to eat what's alive and not infected?

PSYCHOTHERAPIST	There are chemical changes happening that are impacting brain function significantly. Observation would tell you that rage and shame are both at work in a very big way.

OPERATOR	The wireless customer you're calling is not available... The wireless customer you're calling is not available…

REPORTER 3	So, if you're thinking about rationing food, that's smart. But you also need to be thinking about your water. We've still got running water here for now, but we're starting to hear from other major matropolitan areas that they are losing access. And a human being can survuve up to three weeks without food, but water is more like three days.

AIDAN	Hi. This is my first log, I  guess. I think it's recording. My name is Aidan. And it's been seven days since this started. The news is calling it a global pandamic. I've been alone since day one. Which is weird because I've never been by myself more than a day in my entire life. And I can't leave. And the phones are… Can you hear that? It's constant. All the time. And… And I'm… I'm trying to…
 
DR. JAIN	Now, there are two things going wrong in an infected brain. The first is that the reptilian brain becomes hyper- sensitive, particularly in the areas that control anger and aggression… Triggered, as we have seen, by contact with the uninfected living things. That when the reptilian brain is engaged, it supresses the natural activity of the frontal cortex. Not enough to affect action, but enough to…

INTERVIEWER	To scream.

DR. JAIN	Yes, and cause involuntary movements. Although involuntary movements is a misnomer. The twitching is the last movements that an infected…
 
MAN	You're crazy!

INTERVIEWER		So you're saying that they know what they're doing?

DR. JAIN	On some basic level, yes. And they're almost screaming at themselves to stop. But they can't.

AIDAN	Hey, this is Aidan. This is my 16th video log, I think. I've made one every day since… I've made one almost every day since the first one. I'm slowly running out of… like everything. I mean, I know at some point I'm going to have to go out there. But...The news has stopped sending people out to shoot anything new. So, they keep playing the same clips over and over, and keep saying the same things. And it's weird how they try to stay calm and act calm like nothing's happening. But… You can tell that something is. I still watch it though because I… I  dunno, maybe I'll see my family on it. I know it's stupid. What are the odds, right? I read this thing a long time ago about sensory deprivation. They put people in these sensory deprivation chambers. No sound, no sight, nothing. And then after a little while, you…you kind- of…you start to hallucinate. Completely sane people would start to see things. Just to see something. Kind-of like an input for the brain. And I think that I've started to… Like out of my periphery, I…I dunno… I think that there'll be like a… That's real.
 
JESSICA	No.
 
AIDAN	What is happening to me? It's like I… No, I do know what is happening. It's not a mystery. I'm losing my mind. I keep… I keep thinking about these stories, where…A guy crawls miles in the snow on two broken legs just to get to safety. And I can't even open my front door. It's a hell of a thing to find out that you're a coward, to like, to like know that, you know? Well, I begin starving in three days. What the… Did you hear…
	
OPERATOR	All circuits are currently busy. Please try again later.
 
MOM	Aidan. Honey, are you there? It's mom. Your dad and I are really worried about you. I hope you're at home. Your sister got out of town before the roads got blocked.

DAD	Go to your sister.

MOM	She's heading to our cabin.
 
DAD	Be safe.

MOM	We couldn't get out of here fast enough. Please try to get ahold of her. She isn't answering our calls. I don’t know if the phones are down or what. Please do everything you can to get in touch with her. And honey, don't worry.
 
AIDAN	No…

MOM	We're here locked in with everyone at the office. We're okay.
 
DAD	I wish we were all together.

MOM	Listen to me, honey. Do not go outside, and keep the doors locked. There's somebody outside the door. Get out of here.

DAD	Mary. Stay under the desk.

MOM	What's happening?

DAD	I'll be right back. Stay here.

WOMAN	Please don't! That's my daughter! Please don’t!

MOM	Tom. Tom.

WOMAN	Please. Stop. Please. Stop.

BRANDON	I'm okay! (whispers) I'm okay!
 
SCREAMER	Help me! Come here. Come here. Come here.

AIDAN	This is Aidan. It's day forty-two. I'm sorry. Shoot. This is my last video blog. My battery's about to die, and I don't have any way of charging it now. So… I met a girl today. Well, met might be a strong word because... I'm almost certain that she was real, though. And she might be alone, too, and need water or food or help somehow. And I could help her, I think. So tomorrow I'm going to try. I'm sure she was real. She has to be. And, oh yeah, oh, there goes my battery. Hi. Oh my God, you look like a psychopath. Aidan. No, no, no, no, no. What… No. Eva. Hi. Yeah? Yeah, me too. Shoot. This sucks. (whispers) You're the first…' person... Where did you put it? Come on, Aidan. Stupid. Right, she can see you. Stop talking to yourself. (whispers) Shit. Shitload. Oh my gosh. I can't believe this is working. She's joke...(laughs) She's joke… I know. No, no, no, no, no. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Bye, Eva. Eva. That's not good. Umm… (whispers) Please work.
 
SCREAMER	Stop!

AIDAN	No! Hey! No! No! Here! Yeah. Here! Here! Here! Here! Here! Yeah! Shit.

SCREAMER	Stop!

AIDAN	Shit. Hey! Hey! Hey! No! No! Look! Hey! Right here! Right here! Right here! Hey! Right here! Right here!

SCREAMER	Stop!
 
AIDAN	Get inside! No! Hey! Come on.
 
SCREAMER	Stop it!
 
AIDAN	I don't know what to do, okay? Tell me what I should do. If I stay here, I die. You know that. Okay, so, then what? You can't get to her through the hallways. No hallways. Get closer to her. But what the hell is closer? Every door is locked in the hallways. Maybe I could... Oh, that's it. I hate this. Oh yeah, this stuff never goes bad. Oh, yeah. (whispers) Of course. He's a rock climber. (whispers) God. Yes, yes, yes. (whispers) Something, something, anything. (whispers) There's got to be something. There's got to be something in here. Come on. Oh, oh. Whoa. Sh… Badass.
			
SCREAMER	No! No!
 
AIDAN	Get off me!
 
WOMAN SCREAMER	Help me. Help me. Help me. Help...

AIDAN	You've got to be kidding me. This just doesn't get any easier!

SCREAMER	Keep away! Keep away!
 
AIDAN	(heavy breathing) Thank you. (whispers) Okay. Hello. Wait, how am I going to get it to her? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay, all right. Okay, okay. You're a fucking ninja. You're a fucking ninja. You are a ninja. Yes.
 
EVA	Hello? Uh, Aidan? Hello?

AIDAN	Eva. Hey. It's… Oh wait.

EVA	Aidan? Are you there?

AIDAN	Yeah. Hey. Eva, hi. It's Aidan. Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me?

EVA	(whispers) Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you.

AIDAN	Hey. Hi. Hello.

EVA	Hi. I can't believe you did this.

AIDAN	(laughs) Sorry. Umm, it's been a while. Uh, how are you?

EVA	(laughs) I'm fantastic now. How are you?

AIDAN	I'm great. It's really nice to hear your voice, Eva.

EVA	It is so nice to hear your voice, too.

AIDAN	Oh, Eva, before I forget… Is that pounding still happening on your wall because I was thinking…

EVA	Uh, hey, Aidan?

AIDAN	Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

EVA	Sorry, I just haven't talked to anyone in a really really really long time.
 
AIDAN	Yeah, me neither.

EVA	Do you think we could maybe just… I mean, I know we're going to have to deal with all of it soon, but maybe… For a few minutes, we could maybe just talk about something else? So, you surf, right?
 
AIDAN	Uh, yes, I surf. Yeah.
 
EVA	You have a girlfriend, right? I feel like I've seen…
 
AIDAN	Uh, that wasn't my girlfriend. Uh, what about you? Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend?

EVA	No. I mean, I was engaged a couple years ago. But no, not since then. Have you ever been in love?

AIDAN	I was in love once. Yeah, in fifth grade. Jenny Caldwell. She was adorable, and she held my hand. And then I cried. And I threw up. It was the most romantic love story of this generation. (laughs) I see that you like to draw. Do you…do you like to draw?

EVA	Yeah, I love to draw. (laughs) You've been a subject of mine once or twice.

AIDAN	You've drawn me before?

EVA	It sounds a lot weirder than it actually is.

AIDAN	I feel so violated.

EVA	Just, I mean, I don't have very much to look at lately. So, sorry. I saw what you did last night. It was… so brave. And courageous. And I can't thank you enough.				
	
AIDAN	Thank you, Eva.
				
EVA	Talk later?
				
AIDAN	Yeah, talk later. Always wanted to be in one of these. It's like the movies. Ugh, it really smells in here. Shit, shit. He's dead. He's really dead. He's dead. (whispers) Okay. (whispers) Come on, please. Oh my… Whoa. No way. Twinkies. Oh, be good to me. Mmm, mmm. Oh my God. I got to tell Eva. Oh my God. She'd freak out. Hey, Eva?

EVA	Aidan?
 
AIDAN	Eva, you're not going to believe what I just found.

EVA	Where have you been?

AIDAN	I went to look for food.

EVA	What?

AIDAN	Eva, look. I found something.

EVA	What were you thinking?

AIDAN	Are we… Are we fighting?
  
EVA	Yes, Aidan. Because you just left.

AIDAN	I don't really know why you're mad.
 
EVA	You didn't tell me. We didn't talk about. I've been trying you for the last twenty minutes getting no answer, thinking you were dead. You're scared of being alone? Well so am I.

AIDAN	I'm so sorry, Eva.

EVA	We do things together now, okay? You don't withhold the fact that you're completely out of food. We talk about it, and we find a way to fix it together.

AIDAN	It's kinda nice to not be the only co-dependent one in this relationship, you know?

EVA	Shut up. Where are you?

AIDAN	Uh, next door, I think.

EVA	Is it safe?

AIDAN	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, there's nobody here. I came through the crawl space above my bathroom, and there's nothing alive up there. So…

EVA	And you found food?

AIDAN	Eva, you will not believe. We could…we could wait this thing out. I mean, these things are gonna starve, you know? And then I could go find my sister. We could find your family. And, and, we could get out of here. And there's got to be other people like us. You know, that…that survived. We can find some place safe, you know? Eva?

EVA	I don't know how much longer I can wait.

AIDAN	Are they at your wall again? Damnit.

EVA	Four, five times a day now.

AIDAN	The news said they repeat patterns when they get

EVA	I made a rope, like yours.

AIDAN	You what?

EVA	Out of bed sheets. Do you think if I climbed down on my side, I could get back up on yours?
 
AIDAN	Uh, yeah, maybe.

EVA	Or maybe the hallways?

AIDAN	No, no, no. No hallways, Eva. No hallways. The…the rope was a good idea, okay? I'll come to you.

EVA	No, no. It's too much for you to risk.

AIDAN	I'm not gonna leave you there alone.

EVA	Aidan, no, please. Are you sure it's safe for you to be talking in there?

AIDAN	Yeah, yeah. The fridge is pushed up against the door and everything.

EVA	Wait. What?

AIDAN	What?

EVA	Did you move the refrigerator?

AIDAN	No.

EVA	Well, so what's in there? How could the refrigerator be up against the door? Aidan? Aidan?

AIDAN	I'm here.

EVA	You have to get out of there.

AIDAN	I can't, Eva. I have to go back for the food and the backpack.

EVA	No, no, no. Listen to me. It's not safe. It's not safe. You have to get out.

AIDAN	No, no. Eva, I can't. We'll starve. I have to go back. I have to turn down my walkie, okay, so it doesn't make any noise. Eva, if anything happens to you, throw a wine bottle or something into the courtyard, and I'll hear it break, and I'll come for you. Eva?

EVA	Please come back to me. Please be safe.

AIDAN	I will. What the hell? You're not screaming.

EDWARD	You're not either, but you got blood there.

AIDAN	Oh, I cut myself on something. It's a pretty cool spear you got there.

EDWARD	I made it.
 
AIDAN	Really? You can't just pick one of those up at the convenience store? I'm not sick, okay? If I were, I'd be begging for you to take my life. I've seen what it does.

EDWARD	I apologize for threatening you with this. If I ever did have any manners, I guess they're pretty well gone now.

AIDAN	Yeah. I did come try to take your food, though.

EDWARD	It's not my food. I came through the wall a couple of weeks ago. We're both looters.

AIDAN	Okay. Are you alone?

EDWARD	Huh? Yeah. I'm…yeah. You?

AIDAN	Yeah.

EDWARD	Who were you talking to earlier?

AIDAN	What?

EDWARD	I heard you talking…earlier.

AIDAN	Oh, that was…me. I…I talk to myself sometimes now.

EDWARD	I do it all the time. But I'm old. Old people do that.

AIDAN	So I guess whoever lived here was out of the apartment when it started.

EDWARD	You didn't know him?

AIDAN	No, did you?

EDWARD	Well, sort-of. I mean, he was my neighbor. But he wasn’t out. He killed himself in the bathroom back there. Did you open those?

AIDAN	What?

EDWARD	The curtains.

AIDAN	Yeah. To let the light in. He killed himself?

EDWARD	Don't do that, okay?

AIDAN	Okay.

EDWARD	Yeah. Cut his wrists in the bathtub. It must've been in the early days, given how much food was left when I came through the wall.
 
AIDAN	Where's the body?

EDWARD	I wrapped it in a blanket, taped it up, and dragged it into the hall. Is that the only bag you brought?

AIDAN	Yeah.

EDWARD	Wait. I'll bring you another one. You looked like you were hungry.

AIDAN	Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely.	

EDWARD	Chew it. Eat it slowly.

AIDAN	Right. Wow. Thank you. This is…this is really good.

EDWARD	Thank you. I cure it myself. Always have done.
 
AIDAN	Oh wow.

EDWARD	Did you live with anybody before this?
 
AIDAN	What?

EDWARD	Eat slowly. Chew it. Chew it.

AIDAN	Sorry.

EDWARD	You know, I mean, roommate? Girlfriend?

AIDAN	No. No, it was just me.

EDWARD	You've been alone the whole time? I mean I'm only saying that just because if there were someone, we should make sure that they get something to eat. Have you killed anybody yet? Oh, I shouldn't ask you that. I'm sorry. I really shouldn't.

AIDAN	No, no, really, it's okay. I have. But there's…there's one that I didn't kill. And…he's the one I think about still.

EDWARD	Why would you kill someone if you don't absolutely have to?

AIDAN	Hey, did you watch the news before the power went out? It said that these people know what they're doing. Can you imagine that? I'd want somebody to kill me too.

EDWARD	Maybe they'll find a cure.

AIDAN	Shit. We've been looking for a cure to cancer for over a hundred years. And that was before the world went to shit, so…
 
EDWARD	I should let you eat.

AIDAN	Oh, I'm sorry. That…that wasn't helpful at all. You've been so kind. I… Have you had to?

EDWARD	Had to what?

AIDAN	Kill one.

EDWARD	Me? No. No, never.

AIDAN	That's good. Hey, you sure that you're okay with all of this?

EDWARD	There's got to be enough here for us for a month. And we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

AIDAN	Yeah, and I do think that if we hold out as long as possible, they'll all eventually starve and die.

EDWARD	You're probably right actually, given the limited supply of what those cannibals eat.

AIDAN	If I grab something you want me to leave, let me know.

EDWARD	Yeah.


AIDAN	Do you think he had a wife?

EDWARD	What?

AIDAN	The guy who lived here.

EDWARD	Jonathan. His name was Jonathan.

AIDAN	Yeah, sorry.

EDWARD	Wife, no, I don't think so. There were no womens clothes here.

AIDAN	Yeah, I was just thinking that it might be a reason to…give up.

EDWARD	I mean, if your partner got sick with this, yeah I guess for some people it might be. Maybe. Oh, that's mine. Have you lost anybody to this?

AIDAN	My parents.

EDWARD	I'm sorry.

AIDAN	And my sister, I think. I don't know. But that's it, really. They're the only three people in the world that I gave a shit about and gave a shit about me, so…

EDWARD	Well your sister, I mean she might be alive.

AIDAN	It's actually worse not knowing. You know, wondering if I should be out there trying to find her. I mean, I think it's worse.
 
EDWARD	I don't know whether I agree with you there.

AIDAN	Yeah, I'm sorry.

EDWARD	Think about it for a minute. Imagine you've been with someone for most of your life, and it's been a long life. So whoever you each became, you became together. And together was really the only way you knew yourself. Imagine that you had problems like everybody has problems. But whenever you looked at her, you knew exactly who was looking back. And you knew exactly what she felt for you and what you felt for her. No matter what else was going on around you, you knew. You knew. You knew that at the core, it was unchangeable. And then...she became sick. Or whatever that is that's going on out there. She didn't look at you with love anymore. She looked at you with hate. Just the sight of you filled her with hatred. Imagine what that must be like. I think that'd be worse.

AIDAN	Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm talking about. I…

EDWARD	(laughs) Come on. Don't be silly. I'm just an old man having fun. I'm wiling away the time. Debating with a young man. Making up stuff just for argument's sake.

AIDAN	Okay.

EDWARD	I shouldn't be having fun. Not at this time. You're a young man, and your future has been ruined by this. It's not fun. And I feel sad for you. I do. I feel very sorry. There's some booze at the top shelf up there. Go grab some for yourself.

AIDAN	Yeah. (whispers) Oh wow. (whispers) Oh wow.

WIFE	Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.

EDWARD	You've come to. Took your time about it. I hope I didn't hurt you.

AIDAN	What's going on?

EDWARD	Please keep your voice down for God's sake.

WIFE	Help me!

EDWARD	Lucy! Stop! I'm so sorry. I…I really am. This was supposed to have been finished already. But…you were unconscious and she wouldn't.

AIDAN	She wouldn't what? She wouldn't what?

WIFE	Kill me!

EDWARD	Lucy, stop! I…I don't know your name.

AIDAN	Aidan.

EDWARD	Aidan. I'm Edward.
 
AIDAN	Please! You can't.

EDWARD	It's important you keep your voice quiet. It arouses her when she hears you.

AIDAN	No! Oh God!

WIFE	Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

EDWARD	Lucy, please.

WIFE	Kill me. Oh God. Kill me!

EDWARD	I've never hurt anyone in my life. Never. This isn't who I am. But what else can I do? I love her. You take care of the person you love. You cant' take care of everybody, not in times like this. But you take care of your family. How can that be wrong?

AIDAN	If you kill me, she won't eat.
 

EDWARD	I know that. So…what we're gonna do is you're gonna take these pain pills. As many as you want. And then when they take effect, I'm going to make a little cut in your femoral artery. Then you'll bleed. And when you've bled enough until you're too weak to resist, I'll bind your feet and move you closer to her. You won't feeling anything by then. Nothing.

WIFE	Kill me!

AIDAN	How long has she been like this?

EDWARD	Since the beginning.

AIDAN	You've done this before! Just like with your neighbor!

EDWARD	No. He was already dead. She wouldn't touch him. No, you're…you're the first human person. My…my two dogs. She had my two dogs.

AIDAN	This is crazy!

EDWARD	My beautiful loving loyal dogs. She didn’t understand it waas them. God, she would be so disappointed in me.

AIDAN	The only part of her that's your wife is telling you what she wants.

EDWARD	She doesn't know what she wants!

AIDAN	She's begging you to die!

EDWARD	She's sick. And there…there may be a cure.

AIDAN	And then what? She's…she's never going to forgive herself for eating people!

EDWARD	Anyone who survives this will have to be forgiven unforgivable things.

AIDAN	You can't. You can't, man.

EDWARD	I have to. I don’t have a choice.

AIDAN	No, please!

EDWARD	No, you please!

AIDAN	I don't…

WIFE	Kill me.

AIDAN	She's in pain.

EDWARD	She's in pain? I'm in pain. Jesus God! She was a teacher. Did you know that? I don’t think I told you that.
 

EVA	Aidan!

EDWARD	Jesus Christ!

AIDAN	No! No, no, no, no, no! No!

EDWARD	You're with someone! You're with someone! Oh no!

AIDAN	Eva?

EVA	Aidan. Listen to me. They're inside. They're in my house.

AIDAN	I'm coming to get you. Come on!

EVA	They're in my room.

AIDAN	I'm coming to get you.

SCREAMER	Get away. Get away. Get away!

EVA	Aidan?!

AIDAN	I'm coming!

EVA	No! Get off! Aidan! Hurry! Get him off!
 
AIDAN	Get off of me! Eva? You have to climb down to me. You can do it! Just look at me! Look at me!

EVA	Aidan, I…

AIDAN	Eva, you have to! You have to! Okay? Just climb down! You can do it! Yeah. I got you! I got you! Just like that. Hi.
	
EVA	Hi.
	
AIDAN	We should probably… Go. Ready?
 
EVA	Yeah.

AIDAN	Eva! I got you!

SCREAMER	Kill me.

EVA	Aidan. Aidan.

AIDAN	I got it. I got it. I got it.
 
SCREAMER	Kill me.

AIDAN	Forget it. We'll leave him. Come on. Come on.

SCREAMER	Kill me.

AIDAN	Okay, all right, we're here. We're gonna get out, make a right, go around the corner, and then straight into 4327.
EVA	4327.

AIDAN	Okay?

EVA	Okay.

AIDANR	eady?

EVA	Yeah.

AIDAN	Eva!
 
EVA	Aidan!? Aidan, watch out!

AIDAN	No! Are you okay?!

EVA	I'm okay.


AIDAN	Did he get you?

EVA	No. No.

AIDAN	No? Okay.

EVA	I'm good.

AIDAN	Okay. All right. Go! Go! Go! Go!
 
EVA	Aidan! Aidan. Aidan.
 
AIDAN	Damn it! I'm sick of this! Oh, hey! Wait, don't touch me! Stop. Stay back. Here. Eva, take this.
 
EVA	No.

AIDAN	Hold me off. Just, you have to hold me off, please. you have to hold me off, please.

 EVA	(cries) No. Please don't make me do this. No. I can't.
 
AIDAN	Eva, I don't know how much time we have.

EVA	Aidan, please.

AIDAN	If it's bad… Eva, you have to hold it up! Hold it up!

EVA	(cries) Please don't make me do this! Please! I'm begging you, Aidan. Don’t. Stop! No! Aidan! Stop! Aidan, please don't! Please don't do this! Please don't do this. Please. Aidan. Aidan, no. Please. Please get down. Aidan, I can't do this without you. Please. Don't do this. Please. Please.

AIDAN	Eva, you're going to be okay.

EVA	(cries) No, I'm not. I'm not.

AIDAN	Go to the attic in my bathroom and take it to my neighbor's apartment. They have food. It'l last you the rest of the month. You'll wait it out.
 
EVA	(cries) I'm not going to make it if you're not here. Please don't go. Please.

AIDAN	Eva, you saved my life. And I love you.

EVA	Oh my God. Oh my God.

AIDAN	Cool.

EVA	(laughs) I hate you.

AIDAN	(laughs) I'm sorry. Eva, we can beat this. We're stronger together.

EVA	Okay.
