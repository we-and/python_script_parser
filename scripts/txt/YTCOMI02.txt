STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends, Really Useful around the World!

STORYTELLER	Thomas goes to New York.
STORYTELLER	Thomas was delivering some rolling stock to the Brooklyn Docks.
STORYTELLER	He was very excited. “New York!” said Thomas. “What a wonderful place! I can’t wait to see it.” The rails drop down into a tunnel......and Thomas is plunged into darkness.
STORYTELLER	And that’s when everything went dark!
STORYTELLER	“Fizzling fireboxes,” said Thomas “Who turned out the lights?”

STORYTELLER	There were stations in the tunnel – and that’s when Thomas realised he must be under the city!

STORYTELLER	“This is amazing!” said Thomas.

STORYTELLER	“But... there’s not much to see down here!”

STORYTELLER	Which was when the track started to go up and Thomas saw some light at the end of the tunnel!
STORYTELLER	“Oh, wooow!” said Thomas. “So this is New York!”

STORYTELLER	“I’ve never seen so many people!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas had never seen such tall buildings either. We see Thomas is rolling slowly to a halt...

STORYTELLER	And then there was trouble!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was lifted up and up and up and up!
STORYTELLER	And up and up and up!
STORYTELLER	“Cinders and ashes!” said Thomas. “No,” said one of the Building Workers, showing Thomas his sandwich. “Pastrami on rye.”

STORYTELLER	The Builders laughed. They had never seen anything quite like Thomas the number one blue engine...

STORYTELLER	...and Thomas had never seen anything like New York City!

STORYTELLER	“Now that’s what I call a view!” said Thomas.
