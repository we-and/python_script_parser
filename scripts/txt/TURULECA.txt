isabel	perhaps she doesn’t feel at home here?

mister cocoricó	in that case, the only thing to do is exchange her…

isabel	would you take turuleca back?

turuleca	(gestos)(08:21)

mister cocoricó	hens are like that: sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t.

turuleca	(7:52)(gestos)(08:09)

mister cocoricó	we've known each other a long time... i think this "special" hen i sold you. might not believe at your expectations what i hear, has fallen short on your egg-laying. so, in exchange for that useless thing, plus a very slight extra charge, this wonderful laying hen is all yours.

matthew	(gs).

antonio	alistair, i'm pretty sure when we get to the big city... we're going to be a runaway hit. then maybe start a world tour, and that way have enough money to pay back what i owe you.

alistair troubles	dream on, antonio. you’ll never make it to the big city.

turuleca	(g) wa… what’s?

alistair troubles	your time is up, tomorrow you'll have to start paying back your debt. if you default by even one day, the circus will be mine.

antonio	(gs)/ you tall me you wanted to help me to save my circus./ (gs)

alistair troubles	your circus? that's your problem, antonio. your memory’s getting rusty. no one comes to see you, not even in these two-bit towns, but still you’re daydreaming about a world tour. stop wasting your time and start packing your bags.

turuleca	yes, i said something.

matthew	(gs) no! no! no way. it’s impossible. or is it? come on, talk. say something.

turuleca	i don't know what to say.

matthew	ah, ha, ha! this is...insane...! you know animals can’t talk, don't you?

turuleca	you're an animal and you can talk, right?

matthew	you're amazing. i have to tell lucy, my dad...! everybody!  lucy! lucy!

turuleca	wait up! can you take me to the big city?

matthew	i don't think we're going. my dad's about to lose the circus.


turuleca	then how am i gonna find isabel?

matthew	is isabel another talking hen?

turuleca	no, she's like you, well, a little older....

matthew	i wish everything could be different too, but folks aren't interested in the circus anymore.

turuleca	if more people went, could you save it?  may be is crazy i don´t know,  never mind.

matthew	come on, say it!

turuleca	what if i performed at the circus...?

matthew	wow, that would be great!

turuleca	really?

matthew	no, no, but we can't. our circus doesn't use animals, that's inhumane. they can't say whether they want to be part of the show or not.

turuleca	that's true. but i sure can. i want to join the circus and that's good for both of us, right?

matthew	perfect! i've got it...! imagine: enter the magician, music, mystery… he pulls you out of a hat, then he hypnotizes you. and you start talking. tah-dah!

turuleca	no! that would make me feel, really embarrassed. (sing)

matthew	no? what about if you… uh, hey, you have any ideas?/ what are you doing?

lucy	bravo! bravo! this is going to be the best act of all time! (gs)/ turuleca(ríe)

matthew	this is lucy, my best friend / she's gonna be our new star!

lucy	turuleca!

antonio	kiddo, if i don't pay him back, mr. troubley is going to keep the circus. this isn't the time for you to be thinking up new numbers. it's crazy!

matthew	dad, it's different, something never seen before.

antonio	no matter how original it might be, i don't think anything can save the circus. 

matthew	don't we have another chance?

antonio	only a miracle can save us.

lucy	matty has found that miracle.../ (g)

matthew	(g) come on turu, talk please. ...

alistair troubles	out of my way, stupid bird!

turuleca	(g)

alistair troubles 	3, 6, 10. you sold 15 tickets. that's for the first show, not bad. for the second, they haven't sold a single ticket. from what i can see, nobody's waiting in line to buy more. isn't that right, rudy?

rudy	nobody.

lucía	(g)

alistair troubles	i've been of dreaming of this moment since the day your father kicked me out of the circus. it's all a matter of being patient, and at last that day has arrived.

antonio	i'm not going to let him./ (g)

matthew	(29:13)(g)/ dad, give me a chance, please.

antonio	kiddo, you're the circus musician and you're really good, but you've never performed alone.

matthew	there's always a first time.

antonio	have you really drilled it?/ (g)

matthew	more or less. but don't worry, in two hours i can have the dj mixing desk up and running.

lucy	we could start with the trapeze act, that would give him more time, right?

antonio	(g)/ no! no way!

matthew	(g) /you have to trust me!

antonio	i trust you, but i'm (still) not going to buy into your fantasies.

matthew	it's no fantasy! you have to believe me.../ (g).

antonio	is she part of your act? a chicken? the audience is going to laugh at you. besides, this circus doesn't use animals.

lucy	antonio, it's not just any animal. she can... come on matty, you tell him.

turuleca	i can explain....

antonio	huh?! what... what's going on? you've got something hidden here? that's a good trick. huh? it's...a real hen.ah, ha, ha. all right! matty go prepare the mixing desk. lucy, tell your parents the icarus family is on first! and i, i have to figure out how to introduce her. come on, times-a-wasting!

alistair troubles	the only real thing of value in this circus is you. glory awaits you with me, my dear, turuleca.

turuleca	finally, he said it right!

matthew	turu, this isn't the time.

antonio	i... i don't know how to begin to apologize, but in a desperate effort to save the circus, i've made bad decisions. everyone is free to do as they wish./ (g)

everyone	bravo! bravo! ha, ha, ha!!

alistair troubles	(g) pardon the interruption, but just so you know, i'm going to give the order to take down the big top, and i'll do it with everyone inside if i have to.

turuleca	finding isabel.

matthew	perfect, starting today our lives are gonna change forever. success, fame...

turuleca	the big city...

matthew	then paris, madrid, london, new york. the world at our feet!

lucy	imagine that, turuleca. everyone will be dying to see you, shouting your name.

turuleca	i love it! what will isabel say when she finds out?	

lucy	she'll be delighted...

matthew	... and proud of you.

turuleca	i hope so... and vincent… what will he think?

lucy	and vincent is your...?

turuleca	yes, and no. i dunno. i think so…

matthew	is he a rooster?

everyone	laugh

alistair troubles	welcome to the greatest circus of all time! the grand troubley circus!

rudy	and rudy the great! oops my bad, mr. troubley.

alistair troubles	it’s pretty, don't you think, rudy?

rudy	yes, boss.

alistair troubles	i already own the world's largest zoo, 23 theatres, 48 cinemas and 3 tv channels.

rudy	(gs)/ ...and a dog wash. (gs)

alistair troubles	exactly. but nothing matters more than destroying the daedalus circus, and transforming it into the grand troubley circus. 

rudy	uhhh, this.

alistair triubles	and you know why?

rudy	ah! no. why? (g)

alistair troubles	i was a great contortionist, i could do amazing things. however, the clueless audience kept cheering and cheering for antonio, he and his hack routine of balancing himself on 50 chairs.

rudy	fifty chairs!

alistair troubles	until one day he suffered an unfortunate accident, and that put an end to his career. and while there was never any proof, his father kicked me out of the circus.

rudy	poor guy, you hadn't done anything and...

alistair troubles	rudy!

rudy	oh, yeah, of course, of course.

alistair troubles	the time has come to change our strategy. we have to prevent them from reaching the big city. that's why we're going after that pesky hen. without her, the daedalus circus is done for. turuleca is worth more than everything i own combined.

rudy	there's nothing easier than stealing a hen...

turuleca	(laugh)

matthew	dad, we didn't even try.

antonio	i can't right now.

matthew	but i gave her my word.

antonio	all that matters right now is the premiere.

matthew	turu needs us to find isabel. she's come through with her end of the deal.	

antonio	ouch! son, without turuleca the daedalus circus is doomed to failure! she's not going anyware, understand?

matthew	but what's the problem? turuleca can find isabel and keep performing.

antonio	and if that doesn't happen and she ends up back on the farm? say goodbye to our circus, say goodbye to our dreams. and are you willing to give up turu?

matthew	eh… turu... do you understand me?

turuleca	i can talk like you, but i can't understand you...

matthew	you're not happy here...

turuleca	i didn't say that. (ungry)

matthew	you're a circus star. you don't belong to isabel anymore.

turuleca	i don't belong to anybody! why do humans go around thinking they own everything? don't worry, i can take care of myself.(less ungry)

antonio	matty, come on, we have to write a press release for the tv. ha, ha!! they want to meet our dj boy!

turuleca	(11:54+)(gs)(12:19) wow!/ (gs)(12:52)

matthew	(13:52) lucy, lucy, come over here, come...

irina	yeah, of course, just like we've rehearsed.

lucy	go ahead, i'll catch up in a second.... 

irina	don't take long, we have to change before the dress rehearsal.

lucy	okay, mom, give me two seconds.../ what's up?

matthew	turuleca's gone....

lucy	what?

matthew	have you seen her?

lucy	no, do you think she left?

matthew	where to? that's impossible... look! what's she doing up there? let's go. 

lucy	no, mati, mabye they something's wrong with her.

matthew	i know, and i feel responsible.

lucy	i tihnk you should go.

matthew	tell my dad, that turu isn't feeling well, and that it's better if she doesn't rehearse. that way she can rest before the show.

lucy	but matty....


matthew	please, i don't want him to worry.  everything will be fine. 

lucy	matty! heights don't scare me.

matthew	thank you./ (gs) heights don't scare me. heights don't scare me!/ (gs) turu! what are you doing up here?!

turuleca	looking for isabel.

matthew	that's crazy, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

turuleca	... no kidding, the city is enormes... i'm never going to find isabel. she loved me when i was a simple hen, when nobody else wanted me. but everything's changed. now i know who i am, and i'll sing when i feel like it, not just 'cos they clap. i'll lay eggs if i want, and if i don't, well, who cares? that's all sound great, right? but, now more than ever, i need to see her, and i don't think that's gonna happen.

matthew	you changed my life, too. i'll always be grateful to you.  i... i love you very much....

turuleca	so do i, and that makes me very happy...

matthew	i once met a kid who was very sad. every day he used to sit discouraged at the edge of a stream, believing there was no way out to his problems. but suddenly something unexpected happened. along came a hen who knew how talk and sing.... come. (gs)


turuleca	okay. (g)

rudy	hey boss, look. something strange is going on!

alistair troubles	(gs)

turuleca	it's the same ambulance that took isabel away.

matthew	(gs)/ (g) turu, there's lots like them, maybe it's not it.

turuleca	you're right....

matthew	but what if it is?

turuleca	what about the premiere?

matthew	this is your chance. that's why you've come here.

turuleca	yes, i know… but i don’t think there's anyway i can reach it...

matthew	look!

turuleca	good idea!
