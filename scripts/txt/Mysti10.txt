ISSIE	I saw someone, run off, and they looked like the horse rustler.

NATASHA	Where are they, this, herd?

NATASHA	Julia, she told us the bore hole was going to be the new water source and then lied to us, and so did you. Hexronn is going to destroy Kauri Point, and you’re one of the bad guys.

SAM	That’s what I’m talking about.

NATASHA	That’s why I like him, because he’s cute.

ISSIE	Yeah, he is.

JULIA	Children will go off the rails when a parent dies.

AMANDA	How does she…

 MITCH	You alright love, you want a hand?

AMANDA	No, I’m just imagining this is Julia’s head.

ISSIE	Brutal.

AMANDA	Yeah well, if she thinks I’m working for that company again, I’m done.

MITCH	Really? Quitting.

ISSIE	Wow mum, that’s really cool.

AMANDA	Yeah, well, I am cool, I’m cool as a…

ISSIE	Don’t push it.

MITCH	Ok, this is how it’s gonna go down.

AMANDA	What?

MITCH	You go in there, you quit, and accidentally drop your pass by the bins where I’ll be secreted.

ISSIE	In the bin?

MITCH	Possibly. Then I’ll go in, have a look round.

AMANDA	What?

MITCH	Find their files on land ownership and I’ll slip out before they cancel your security clearance.

AMANDA	I don’t work at the Pentagon.

ISSIE	I want to come.

MITCH	Not a bad idea, you could create a diversion, buy me some time.

AMANDA	Stop it. Nobody is breaking in anywhere, ok. There is a better, and more importantly legal way to do this.

MITCH	Sue them.

AMANDA	No, put in a property sales information request, should be in the public domain, they have to give it to you.

MITCH	Or, we could…

AMANDA	No. Promise me you won’t go rogue. Both of you.

ISSIE	Fine.

MITCH	Fine.

ISSIE	But, Gran’s way is much more fun.

ISSIE	S’up Neesh.

ANISHA	Hey, um, what happened to the campaign website, it’s gone.

ISSIE	Yeah, they took it down.

ANISHA	What? But they can’t. That sucks. I’m sorry but Hexronn are totally dodge.

ISSIE	Yeah, and you haven’t seen the boss lady they sent over either. Do you remember Angelina Jolie in that movie where she was super evil and had horns?

ANISHA	Yikes. Also. You didn’t tell me about Dan.

ISSIE	I did.

ANISHA	Yeah, but you didn’t tell me how cute he was.

ISSIE	He’s a friend.

ANISHA	Yeah, a really fit friend. You should totally ask him out.

ISSIE	What? No.

ANISHA	Yes.

ISSIE	No.

ANISHA	Yes.

ISSIE	No. Ok, I’ve got to go now, bye.

ANISHA	Alright, bye.

SAM	Mate.

COFFEE PATRON	How you going mate, good to see ya.

NATASHA	Hello?

NATASHA	Ok.

NATASHA	Is it done? Is what done?

SAM	Got you a muffin, just careful of the crumbs. You’re gonna have to talk to me one day you know?

NATASHA	I didn’t want anything.

SAM	Well I thought you might get hungry and there’s nothing at the office.

NATASHA	I’m not going to the office, I need to go to the stables.

SAM	Look, I’ll take you there later, but I don’t want you there all day, hanging out with that lot.

NATASHA	What? and so Aramis just has to wait to be fed?

SAM	Can’t Tom do it? Isn’t that what we pay him for?

NATASHA	No, he’s my horse, I have to look after him.

SAM	Fine. But I’m moving him as soon as we find another stable.

NATASHA	Whatever.

SAM	And I want you straight home when you’re done.

NATASHA	Sorry.

DAN	Hey, are you alright?

ISSIE	Me? Yeah.

ISSIE	Ah, so did Stella have any luck getting the website back up?

DAN	Nah, they’ve blocked everything.

ISSIE	That gives me the chills, the things that they get away with.

CALEB	Have you seen her?

DAN	Who?

CALEB	Caroline. She just, left, without me, cycled off.

ISSIE	Oh.

DAN	Sorry.

ISSIE	So you and Caroline are still arguing?

CALEB	She’s upset that I came out to you and not to her.

ISSIE	Oh, I feel bad.

CALEB	No, it’s my secret, I’ll tell who I want.

ISSIE	Yeah I guess.

CALEB	But she’s not even speaking to me, it’s weird.

DAN	Tom’s on the war path. Apparently Gally’s bandages are all over the floor…

CALEB	I know. I just got here.

DAN	Don’t shoot the messenger. It’s weird, Caroline coming in without Caleb, they’re usually joined at the hip.

ISSIE	Yep.

DAN	No, really they were, medically.

ISSIE	Were they?

DAN	No. Oh, you are so easy to wind up.

ISSIE	Yeah, my friend Anisha says that.

DAN	Oh, Anisha, she was cool.

ISSIE	Yep, everyone loves Anisha. You know, you should be flattered. She thinks you’re cute.

DAN	Yeah? She’s got a point.

ISSIE	Ah, pleased of yourself much?

DAN	Well I am very appealing to horses, so.

ISSIE	Yeah, well, horses like me too, so what does that say?

DAN	I don’t know, maybe you are as well.

ISSIE	What? Cute?

DAN	Oh, no.

ISSIE	You just called me cute?

DAN	No I didn’t.

ISSIE	Yes you did.

DAN	Fine. Maybe you are.

ISSIE	Oh.

DAN	Usually you say it back.

ISSIE	Ok, fine, you are also, attractive, to horses.

CAROLINE	Hamish could come home with the Heartland Shield. He must be so psyched.

STELLA	Yeah, he’s wearing his lucky hair mousse.

CAROLINE	What’s going on?

DAN & ISSIE	Nothing.

ISSIE	So, it’s the rugby finals aye. Go West Valley.

DAN	It’s from Natasha.

CALEB	Guys, I just got this text from Natasha. Really cryptic.

ISSIE	To meet here? Yeah, we all did.

STELLA	I think she’s got something on Hexronn.

ISSIE	Maybe more Julia lies.

DAN	Maybe. My mum thinks we’re just twisting stuff and Hexronn’s all fine.

CAROLINE	Yeah, our mum and dad think we’re obsessed, like we’ve got some sort of group hysteria.

CALEB	Which is frankly, insulting.

NATASHA	Hey, look at this.

STELLA	What is it?

NATASHA	It’s a text my dad sent to someone called A.

ISSIE	What, you went through your dad’s phone?

NATASHA	Yeah, he was acting really weird, he’s obviously up to something.

ISSIE	Where is that?

DAN	In the bush, basically in the middle of nowhere.

CAROLINE	Why would he send it.

NATASHA	I don’t know, but I think it’s got something to do with that.

CALEB	Is it done?

NATASHA	Really sus right? Maybe a Hexronn cover up?

ISSIE	This could be the proof we need. We should go.

CALEB	What? Go out to the pin drop?

STELLA	Guys, I’m out, mum will be here in a minute. I’ve got to go watch Hamish play the finals.

CAROLINE	Yeah, wish him luck, I’ll see you there later.

STELLA	Ok, be careful, yeah.

TOM	Oi, you lot, this is not a youth club, this is a stables, horses, remember them? Get out of here.

NATASHA	Someone’s Mr Grumpy.

TOM	And what exactly are you two doing?

ISSIE	Natasha’s just really upset at the moment.

NATASHA	Oh, that’s true, I’m feeling really fragile today.

TOM	Ok, yeah good, good, good, good, well you, you, you just do that.

NATASHA	That was fun.

SAM	Hey. I’m glad you’re here.

AMANDA	I’ve just come to get my stuff, I can’t work for this company anymore.

SAM	Oh hey, no, come on. You don’t need to do this. Look, it was a mistake, I shouldn’t have said anything to Julia about Issie, but this, come on, it doesn’t mean you need to quit.

AMANDA	I can’t trust you, Sam, if everything I say is going to be broadcast to the entire town. She’s a child, for heaven’s sake.

SAM	Just, give me a chance to explain.

AMANDA	And say what?

SAM	That, I. What about us?

NATASHA	Hey, you know that night during the storm, thanks for that.

ISSIE	It’s ok.

NATASHA	Um, I just wanted to check that you hadn’t said anything to anyone?

ISSIE	No. Of course not.

NATASHA	Can I ask you a question?

ISSIE	Sure.

NATASHA	Do you like Dan?

ISSIE	What? No.

NATASHA	‘cause, you know, um, when we were in the tractor shed, you said you thought he was cute.

ISSIE	Did I?

NATASHA	Well, I mean you agreed.

ISSIE	No, no, I just said that ‘cause you did.

NATASHA	Ok, cool, ‘cause I mean, that would be weird, if you two got together.

ISSIE	Yeah.

NATASHA	See you out there.

NATASHA	Oh, sorry.

DAN	You got kai. Good one London.

ISSIE	Yeah

DAN	Hey, so um, maybe we could hang out, but, after the stables some time? Only if you wanted.

ISSIE	Oh, yeah. 

DAN	Sweet.

ISSIE	We should all do that, all of us.

DAN	Ok. I was meaning, maybe you and I…

ISSIE	I know, but I think it would be fun, if all of us…

DAN	Right. Yeah. Ok. I’ll see you out there, better check out that pin drop.

ISSIE	This isn’t what I was expecting.

CALEB	What were you expecting?

ISSIE	I dunno. Another borehole. Not a caravan.

CAROLINE	Let’s hide our bikes here and have a look around.

NATASHA	I hope there’s a bathroom in there.

DAN	Go wild.

NATASHA	Thanks.

CAROLINE	Come on.

CAROLINE	Can’t hear any movement.

ISSIE	Hello?

DAN	Guys, should we be doing this?

CALEB	Now remember, nobody touch anything. We can’t leave any trace.

NATASHA	What? Well I’m not gonna go outside.

ISSIE	Oh, ah, try hellhound, nut with one’s as l’s a zero instead of an o.

CALEB	I’m in. You’re a genius.

ISSIE	I’m not a genius, this person’s just an idiot.

CAROLINE	Yuck, who lives here.

DAN	Someone with nail fungus.

NATASHA	And no idea how to make a bed.

DAN	I reckon he’s a bit of a loner.

CAROLINE	Yeah, doesn’t look after himself, I’m thinking low self-esteem. He’s a tortured soul.

ISSIE	Oh, and a big fan of rom coms.

NATASHA	Ok, that’s a curve ball.

CALEB	It’s Adam Carter.

NATASHA	Adam Carter, like our old farrier?

ISSIE	A farrier?

NATASHA	Someone who shoes horses.

CAROLINE	Adam was so shady.

NATASHA	He broke in one night and stole some equipment. Tom fired him.

DAN	Why do you think it’s Adam Carter?

CALEB	I found a bank transfer. Look.

NATASHA	It’s from my dad.

DAN	Oh, he’s back.

ISSIE	That’s the guy that tried to take Blaze. The horse rustler.

CAROLINE	It’s Adam Carter.

CALEB	Why are we still talking, let’s go.

DAN	This way.

ADAM	Hades. Enough.

DAN	In here.

ADAM	Hades get, get over here now. Oi.

ISSIE	It’s them, the kauri point herd. I don’t believe it.

CAROLINE	No way.

ADAM	Stupid mutt, get over it…

ADAM	It’s just the horse’s you idiot.

ISSIE	Hey. We’ve been looking for you all for such a long time. I’m gonna take you home, to Blaze.

AMANDA	I’ve done it. I’ve quit.

MITCH	Good on you love. Let’s get you a cappuccino.

AMANDA	What? Where did this come from?

MITCH	Oh, I’ve had it for ages.

AMANDA	Why didn’t you say so?

MITCH	Oh, actually I’d forgotten all about it. Until the other day. And then you were being annoying. Well you were.

AMANDA	Great, well, this is a light read.

ISSIE	Where’s Issie, she should be back by now.

CAROLINE	It’s still there. I can’t believe the match is about to start.

CALEB	Well, there’s always next year.

CAROLINE	Yeah, thanks.

ISSIE	Wait, so A in your dad’s phone is Adam Carter?

DAN	Did you know he was talking to Adam?

NATASHA	Of course not.

CALEB	There must be some explanation.

NATASHA	Yeah, there is. My dad’s a liar and a horse thief. Why would he do this? I guess your dad wouldn’t know anything?

DAN	We’re not talking. He’s pretty rarked up about the whole meeting. Apparently, I’m gonna get him sacked.

NATASHA	Dad’s aye?

DAN	Yeah.

ISSIE	So that’s why Adam was chasing Blaze that first time I saw her. Because he was after the whole herd. He’s gonna come back for her. Isn’t he?

CALEB	That would make sense.

ISSIE	No, we can’t let him do that.

NATASHA	A text, guys. A text. I’ve got reception.

DAN	Text Tom.

CAROLINE	Tell him we’re about to be murdered by Adam Carter.

ISSIE	Yeah, and tell him about the herd.

CALEB	Tell him I was against this from the start.

NATASHA	Ok, ok. It’s sending.

DAN	Did it go through?

NATASHA	No, the thing’s going round, it’s downloading, I’m downloading something.

CAROLINE	You know you’ve only got one per cent?

NATASHA	I know. I just…

CALEB	Stop it, you’re wasting battery.

NATASHA	I know, I can’t.

CAROLINE	I think your phone just died.

NATASHA	Sorry.

ISSIE	Anyone else got any bars?

DAN	No.

CAROLINE	Nothing.

CALEB	Na.

ISSIE	You guys have some serious reception problems in this country.

CALEB	I want to know what she was gonna do with her finger.

SAM	Natasha.

TOM	She’s not here, probably out with the kids.

SAM	Ah, but I told her to… I’ll wait.

TOM	Suit yourself.

SAM	Just to let you know, I’ll be removing Aramis soon.

TOM	Right, ‘cause that will solve everything.

SAM	Excuse me?

TOM	Kids have found you out. And you can’t handle it.

SAM	Now, I’m helping the community Tom, so why don’t you just go play with your ponies.

TOM	Don’t you come in my stables and tell me what…

AMANDA	Oh, um, I didn’t know…

SAM	Amanda, hi.

AMANDA	Is Issie about?

TOM	Ah, no, all the kids are out.

AMANDA	Mmm, I was just gonna give her a lift.

SAM	Oh, look, I can run her back. I’ve got to wait for Natasha anyway.

AMANDA	No. It’s fine. I can wait.

NATASHA	…what, where do you think your cheekbone is.

DAN	It’s there.

NATASHA	What do you think holds up your face?

DAN	Your jaw.

NATASHA	Your cheekbone’s here.

DAN	Oh.

CAROLINE	Guys, the dog’s still out there, it’s getting late, how long have we been here?

CALEB	Hours.

DAN	The olds are gonna go nuts.

ISSIE	Yeah, and I promised I wouldn’t go rogue today. My mum is gonna kill me.

NATASHA	If the dog doesn’t eat us first.

MIRIAMA	Things aren’t great with Jake and Dan and me at the moment. But I thought he’d at least come home for dinner.

CORRINE	Yeah Ken’s said there’s no sign of the twins at home either.

AMANDA	It’s just so strange that no one’s heard from them.

SAM	Let’s just sit tight, I’ll get us a cup of tea. Perhaps you could wash up some mugs Tom?

AMANDA	I’ll give you a hand.

CORRINE	Yeah, let’s give them a bit longer. They’ll be back.

TOM	She’ll be ok. She’s a good kid, they all are.

CAROLINE	So Issie, why you?

ISSIE	What?

CAROLINE	Why did Mystic, of the Kauri Point herd, choose you… when you’re from Sailor’s Bush.

ISSIE	Shepherd’s Bush.

CAROLINE	You’re like the only one of us who can’t ride. That makes zero sense.

ISSIE	No I know, it made zero sense to me for a while. Ok this is weird, remember I told you about the shipwreck. The one that Mystic was on?

CAROLINE	Yeah.

ISSIE	Well there was a girl there, and she was the only one that survived.

NATASHA	Really?

ISSIE	Yeah, and she’s in my visions, she’s wearing a ring. This one.

NATASHA	Wait. So the girl in your visions is wearing that actual ring?

ISSIE	Mmm hmm.

DAN	Where did you get it?

ISSIE	I found it in my Gran’s attic, apparently it’s my great, great, great, great, great, grandmothers.

CAROLINE	No way.

ISSIE	Caleb, your head exploded yet?

CALEB	Thanks, but no, I’m fine, I’m willing to concede there are one or two things that are as yet, unexplained by science.

DAN	I guess that explains your connection with Blaze. I’m going to check on the dog.

DAN	I can’t see anything.

CAROLINE	Maybe it’s gone round the side.

CALEB	You like him, don’t you?

ISSIE	What? No.

CALEB	Issie.

ISSIE	Yeah. I guess. Please don’t say anything though.

CALEB	You think I can’t keep a secret?

NATASHA	Guys, we can make a break for it, it’s gone.

ISSIE	Ok, it’s time to get you out.

ISSIE	Let’s get the main doors open.

NATASHA	Let’s try the side door.

DAN	We’ll never get them through.

NATASHA	Oh no, it’s too late.

ADAM	Hades. What is it? Who’s there?

CALEB	Quick, he’s in the barn.

DAN	We need to go, now.

ISSIE	But what about the herd?

NATASHA	We’ll come back for them.

CALEB	Adam’s gonna be out of there any second. We can’t outrun his truck.

ADAM	There’s no one here, what’s wrong with you.

CAROLINE	Issie where are you going?

ADAM	Let me out.

ISSIE	We have to go back.

NATASHA	What?

CALEB	Adam.

ISSIE	I know, but.

DAN	Come on, we’ve got to go.

ISSIE	Ok, fine. Let’s go.

CORRINE	You ever think of riding again Tom?

TOM	No. Not since, it’s more about the horses for me these days, rehabilitation.

SAM	You lost your nerve aye Tom?

AMANDA	Look, I’m sorry, it’s getting late, I’m starting to…

AMANDA	Is that Natasha?

SAM	No, it’s work. Sorry guys, I’ll just be a sec.

MIRIAMA	Where are they?

SAM	What do you mean they were there? Did you follow them? Where are they now? Well just get back to the barn. Yeah, I’ve already sorted this once, so just fix it.

NATASHA	Don’t beat yourself up, Adam would have caught us.

ISSIE	But Mystic wanted me to save them and I just, left.

CALEB	You had no choice.

ISSIE	I made a mistake.

CAROLINE	Mystic’s with them. We’ll tell Tom and head straight back now.

CALEB	Oh no, mum’s car is here.

KIDS	And mine.

NATASHA	Dad.

CAROLINE	Let’s just tell them what happened, they’ll understand.

TOM	We’ll start the search here.

SAM	Come on, let’s just give them a bit longer.

CORRINE	I’m not just gonna sit and wait.

MIRIAMA	Me neither.

SAM	Ok, I’m happy to drive everyone around. I can get five of us in the jeep.

AMANDA	That doesn’t make any sense.

TOM	Let’s split up, cover more ground.

SAM	It’s gonna be dark soon, so you want Amanda to drive around in a place she doesn’t know on her own?

AMANDA	Yeah, I don’t need your protection thanks.

AMANDA	Issie, where haveyou been.

CORRINE	You two are in big trouble.

ISSIE	Ok, before you go off on one. We found the Kauri Point herd.

DAN	Adam Carter has them.

TOM	Adam?

CAROLINE	We saved them, nearly.

MIRIAMA	Daniel, where have you been? Actually, I don’t want to know, come on, let’s go.

DAN	Mum, the herd.

MIRIAMA	Not those horses again.

SAM	You had me so worried.

TOM	What do you mean, Adam Carter?

CAROLINE	He has them, in the barn.

ISSIE	You have to come with us, we have to rescue them.

CORRINE	What barn, where?

NATASHA	Ask my dad. He knows.

SAM	What do you mean?

NATASHA	That secret pin drop you sent Adam.

SAM	Secret pin drop?

NATASHA	Give me your phone.

NATASHA	How do you explain this, dad?

SAM	Yeah, alright. Look, the land and the barn on it were brought by Hexronn, which is why I have the location, and it had to be cleared, which is why I hired Adam, but I don’t know anything about horses.

NATASHA	But you.

SAM	But, if you’ve sound some that you think are in trouble, then, yeah we should check it out, tomorrow.

ISSIE	No, now, we can’t wait.

SAM	It’s getting late.

CORINNE	And it’ll be dark, let’s not indulge this.

MIRIAMA	Yeah, these kids need to get home.

ISSIE	Mum, I’m sorry I went a bit rogue today. Please.

TOM	I’ll go with you Issie.

AMANDA	Ok, me too.

ISSIE	Oh, thanks mum.

DAN	Mum, I swear to you that they’re there.

MIRIAMA	Sounds like tired minds exaggerating to me, but fine, let’s get on with this.

CAROLINE	So mum, what was the…

CORINNE	We won, -. Still cross, Caroline.

ISSIE	Where are they?
