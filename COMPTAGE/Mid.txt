PETER	I once heard an old proverb about huntin'. Goes like this

PETER	Lions are born knowing they're predators.

PETER	Antelopes understand that they are prey.

PETER	Humans are the only creatures on Earth given a choice.

PETER	I don't know who said that, but I'm pretty sure they never imagined a place like Pensacola.

REPORTER	This morning, a 5,000-dollar reward is being offered by the family of Lucy Baylor, a 16-year-old Pensacola girl who disappeared last week. 
SALESMAN	(sighs)

REPORTER	Investigators for the county sheriff's department said in a press conference Tuesday morning that there are people they'd like to talk to about the disappearance,

REPORTER	but said they are not necessarily suspects.

SALESMAN	(sighs)

SALESMAN	Holy Christ.

SALESMAN	(suffocating wheeze)

POLICE OFFICER	Victim is a Caucasian female,

POLICE OFFICER	approximately 20 years old, (indistinct) trauma due to…

POLICE	(police siren wailing) (indistinct chattering over comms) (car door closes)

YARBROUGH	I didn't know they called y'all already.

BYRON	No. I was just a bit east of here. Thought I'd have a look.

YARBROUGH	Be my guest. 

YARBROUGH	Yeah, it looks like he dragged her from the road.

BYRON	No. She was killed at a primary location and dumped here last night. 

YARBROUGH	How the hell can you reckon that from here?

BYRON	You got an ID? 

YARBROUGH	Yeah. Sarah Kellogg. Twenty-six.

YARBROUGH	Couple of possessions. Couple of solicitations. Last known is Tallahassee. Can't find a Missing report.

BYRON	How's your wife? 

YARBROUGH	Pain in the ass, as usual.

BYRON	Get high-resolution pictures of those bite marks before the heat hits triple digits. 

YARBROUGH	Yeah.

YARBROUGH	You still owe me a beer. 

BYRON	Yeah, I know.

REBECCA	Don't fuck with me tonight, Karl. Fuck you.

KARL	I'm just doin' my job. That's it. 

REBECCA	Okay, well, why don't we switch places?

REBECCA	How about you come in here and shake your ass,

REBECCA	and I'll sit in the car and eat fucking burritos all night.

KARL	I think your guy's here.

REBECCA	 Copy that, Karl.

CALVIN	Knock, knock.

CALVIN	Oh, you've got to be the stupidest bitch in Pensacola. 

CALVIN	You remember me?

REBECCA	I see a lotta people, baby. 

CALVIN	(locks door) Not like me, you don't.

CALVIN	And you're sexy as fuck. Don't worry, I sent your goofy-ass little date packin',

CALVIN	so I don't think we'll be disturbed.

CALVIN	I caught you…

CALVIN	(over comms) back in Loxley, didn't I?

CALVIN	Which makes this second offense punishable, doesn't it?

KARL	Shit!

KARL	This is not our target.

CALVIN	Well, this is my beautiful universe…

CALVIN	(over comms) and every fucking thing in it…

CALVIN	belongs to me. Just like Earth…

CALVIN	(over comms) to God. 

KARL	What? 

CALVIN	So that means all you working bitches

CALVIN	belong to me too. Do you understand what I'm saying?

KARL	Fuck this! I'm comin' in. 

REBECCA	(into earpiece) No.

CALVIN	(laughs)

CALVIN	Okay.

CALVIN	So you're one of those bitches, huh?

CALVIN	Can't hear unless bleeding. Well.

KARL	I'm comin' in. This is not our target. 

REBECCA	(into earpiece) Just give me two minutes.

CALVIN	For what? You gonna do your makeup? Hm?

CALVIN	Cause what's gonna happen…

CALVIN	doesn't have shit to do with lookin' pretty.

CALVIN	Now, lift up that skirt and bend.

REBECCA	No.

CALVIN	Okay.

REBECCA	(groans)

CALVIN	Look what I got. 

REBECCA	(groans)

CALVIN	Now, I could put you in the dumpster

KARL	Goddammit.

REBECCA	Oh, girl. 

KARL	You promised me!

REBECCA	What the fuck did you want me to do, Karl?

REBECCA	He was beating the shit out of me. 

CALVIN	Aw. 

KARL	This is gonna be bad.

REBECCA	(sighs) Karl.

KARL	Let's get the fuck out of here.

REBECCA	Okay, let's go. 

CALVIN	(grunting) Oh, fuck.

MAN	Who among us 

PETER	That's my daughter. Bethany.

PETER	Headin' home to see her now. You want to stay with us tonight?

PETER	My daughter would love you. 

TRACEY LEE	Yes. Please.

PETER	Well, it's settled then.
 
LT. GILBRIGHT	I understand this is emotional for you, Byron. 

BYRON	It's not about emotion. 

LT. GILBRIGHT	Let's see. 

LT. GILBRIGHT	We all got our nuts kicked in over this shit. 

LT. GILBRIGHT	And truth is, you're still young,

LT. GILBRIGHT	and you're too good a lawman to get wrapped around the axle over just one case.

BYRON	Oh, excuse me. Seven unsolved murders is more than one case, sir. 

LT. GILBRIGHT	You know we can't confirm those connections.

BYRON	Listen, this Sarah Kellogg scene,

BYRON	it matches, sir. The bite marks, the positioning, the profile, everything. 

LT. GILBRIGHT	Let me bottom-line this, Byron.

LT. GILBRIGHT	You can't reopen this.

BYRON	Excuse me?

LT. GILBRIGHT	You've been moved to something else.

BYRON	When? 

LT. GILBRIGHT	Right now.

BYRON	Okay. Let's-let's engage the FBI. Multi-jurisdictional capital offender. 
LT. GILBRIGHT	You're joking, right?

LT. GILBRIGHT	You gotta move on.

LT. GILBRIGHT	We don't have a choice. 

BYRON	All right. You know, nobody's ever stood up for those girls.

BYRON	And I just can't seem to reconcile that no more.

KARL	Headquarters is frustrating. 

REBECCA	But he's fucking lucky to be alive. 

KARL	He pulled the plug on us.

KARL	Operation Safe Highway

KARL	is moving out of Florida.

REBECCA	When? 

KARL	Now.

KARL	On to Interstate 5 in the beautiful Northwest. 

REBECCA	No. You go to Headquarters

REBECCA	and you tell them to fuck off.

KARL	It's not your operation. 

REBECCA	The minute I got made bait and trap,

REBECCA	it became my operation. You fucking know that.

KARL	There's nothing I can do about it.

REBECCA	Okay, look, Karl. Last night's fuck-up was on me, okay? I fucked up. I'm sorry.

REBECCA	I have communication with over a dozen active offenders who are chasing down these girls.

REBECCA	My biggest target is lined up for tonight.

KARL	I'm tired of having this conversation.

REBECCA	I'm doing that fucking sting tonight.

KARL	Bullshit! 

REBECCA	Watch me.

REPORTER	 The sheriff's department is working closely with state law enforcement to determine if there's a connection between this case and a string of similar abduction cases

REPORTER	 that have occurred along the I-10 corridor

REPORTER	 in recent months. A spokesperson for the county said that they cannot comment

REPORTER	 as this is an ongoing investigation.

REPORTER	 They were asking anyone with information to come forward.

MS. KELLOGG	Help you?

BYRON	Good afternoon, ma'am. My name is Byron Crawford. 

MS. KELLOGG	You're here to purchase the property, Mr. Crawford?

MS. KELLOGG	Well, it ain't for sale. 

BYRON	No, ma'am.

BYRON	I'm with the Florida state police. And may I ask if you're related to Sarah Kellogg?

MS. KELLOGG	Some prick cop called askin' some downright rude questions. Said they found her outside Pensacola. 
BYRON	I apologize, ma'am.

BYRON	It shouldn't have happened that way. I'm truly sorry for your loss.

MS. KELLOGG	You drove all the way down here just to tell me my daughter been killed? 

BYRON	Yes, ma'am.

BYRON	That's how it should be. I'm sorry you heard other ways. 

MS. KELLOGG	You might as well come

MS. KELLOGG	and sit for a while.

MS. KELLOGG	This the part where you tell me you ain't gonna rest

MS. KELLOGG	until you catch the son of a bitch that killed Sarah? 

BYRON	Uh, no, ma'am.

BYRON	Anybody telling you that is telling you a lie. Odds are against us in a big way.

MS. KELLOGG	Well, don't beat around the bush or nothing, Mr. Crawford. (chuckles) Shit!

MS. KELLOGG	I guess I appreciate the honesty. 

BYRON	Maybe I will take you up on that drink after all.

MS. KELLOGG	Good move. Some days it's best to be drinkin'.

BYRON	Yeah. 

MS. KELLOGG	You from the panhandle, Mr. Crawford?

BYRON	No, not far. Up in Marianna.

MS. KELLOGG	Oh.

BYRON	(sighs)
BYRON	Y'all always been around Tallahassee?

MS. KELLOGG	Tallahassee? Shit, family's been in this house damn near a hundred years. 

MS. KELLOGG	That's me and my twin sister, Caroline.

MS. KELLOGG	I still remember getting that picture taken.

MS. KELLOGG	My mother could not stop fussing with those damn dresses.

MS. KELLOGG	Ma died that summer. Colltier factory fire in Thomasville. 

BYRON	Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. 

MS. KELLOGG	My father was wounded in Korea.

MS. KELLOGG	After my mother died, it was like a switch flipped in his mind. He would drink. Started in the mornin' and be talking to himself by the time we got home from school. 

MS. KELLOGG	Scared the hell out of me. We'd run and hide in the switchgrass. 

MS. KELLOGG	We'd play for hours. It'd get dark.

MS. KELLOGG	We'd never notice. 

MS. KELLOGG	Until he'd come out for us.

MS. KELLOGG	Angry like a crazed dog.

MS. KELLOGG	I can still hear his voice. Sometimes he caught us.

MS. KELLOGG	Sometimes he didn't. We'd just wait. Just have to wait. "Til the clock strikes midnight," Caroline would say.

MS. KELLOGG	"Just like Cinderella."

MS. KELLOGG	Can I get you a beer instead?

BYRON	No, ma'am, um… I'm fine.

MS. KELLOGG	Sarah reminded me so much of Caroline. Both always lookin' to escape.

MS. KELLOGG	And shitty taste in men. 

BYRON	Sarah have a steady boyfriend?

MS. KELLOGG	Hell, I wouldn't even know. She'd been gone

MS. KELLOGG	damn near a year.

BYRON	Well… I'm gonna get out of here.

BYRON	But, um… if you need anything,

BYRON	just give me a call.

MS. KELLOGG	How'd she die? 

BYRON	Excuse me? 

MS. KELLOGG	You know.

MS. KELLOGG	How was Sarah killed?

MS. KELLOGG	Well, then, can I ask you a favor, Mr. Crawford? If by the grace of God… someone happens to catch this… devil that killed my baby girl,

MS. KELLOGG	will you come back and knock on this door? 

BYRON	Good evening, ma'am.

SUZANNA	Who is that?

SUZANNA	(chuckles) Hi, babe.

BABY	(cooing)

BYRON	(soft growling) Aw. Lord, I am so blessed. 

SUZANNA	Mwah. (chuckles)

SUZANNA	Is that Daddy? How was your day? 

BYRON	Um, you don't wanna know.

SUZANNA	(sighs deeply) 

BYRON	I got two phone calls this morning.

BYRON	The first was a missing person's report.

BYRON	Sixteen-year-old girl vanished from a truck stop outside Pensacola last night.

BYRON	And before that, a concrete salesman

BYRON	found a dead body off I-10 by the state line.

SUZANNA	Was it her?

BYRON	Nope. Just some prostitute from East Tallahassee.

BYRON	This job just…

SUZANNA	(crying) 

BYRON	I used to feel God's presence, but now… I don't know.

SUZANNA	You've got His love in your heart. You know that.

SUZANNA	And that's why these girls need someone like you.

SUZANNA	I have faith in you. 

BYRON	Mm.


BETHANY	Is it burning, Mommy?

KAREN	No, honey. It's just steam from the hot water.

BETHANY	It's called Watership Down.

KAREN	Meatloaf. Corn. 

PETER	That's my favorite. 

KAREN	(chuckles)

KARL	This is gonna be bad. 

REBECCA	Feel free to leave anytime.

REBECCA	Nobody's forcing you to stay. 

KARL	We could lose our badges. 

REBECCA	We're not going to lose our badges, Karl. I've been working this guy since Loxley.

KARL	Call the locals.

REBECCA	Nobody gives a fuck about these girls, you know that. If nobody's looking for you,

REBECCA	then you're not really missing.

KARL	I don't want you to get hurt.

REBECCA	Okay.

KARL	I mean it. 

REBECCA	Okay, fine. This will be the last one, okay? 

KARL	Okay.

KARL	And then we'll pack up and we'll go to rainy-ass Seattle.

KARL	I'm not going.

REBECCA	What? 

KARL	Kirsten's gonna divorce me.

REBECCA	Bullshit.

KARL	She hired a fucking attorney.

REBECCA	Karl, I didn't know. I'm sorry. 

REBECCA	Fuck it. He's a no-show. Let's get out of here.

KAREN	Pete, we were gonna do that bookshelf. 

PETER	I know, baby, but there's just so many jobs right now

PETER	and not enough drivers.

KAREN	You know, we're out here in the middle of nowhere with two neighbors we barely know.

PETER	Well, this is why we got full bellies right now, ain't it? 

KAREN	Just seems to be happening an awful lot lately.

PETER	You wanted me off the road. Manager has to be available, honey.

KAREN	I just get a bit lonely out here sometimes.

PETER	Mm-hm.

KAREN	And I can't help but miss you, Pete. 

PETER	Mm.

PETER	I'll wake you up when I get home, all right?

KAREN	Promise? 

PETER	Mm-hm.

PETER	I'll quit if you want. 

KAREN	(chuckles) 

PETER	I will. 

KAREN	No, you wouldn't. 

PETER	Hell yeah, I'll quit right now. You want me to quit?

KAREN	No, don't do that. 

PETER	(chuckles) All right.

PETER	I love you, baby.

TRACEY LEE	(crying shakily) (footsteps) (door opens and closes) (car doors close)

OFFICER GARY	This is a restricted area. Boss ordered a lockdown.

REBECCA	Who's in charge over here?

OFFICER GARY	It's Detective Yarbrough.

REBECCA	Thank you. 

OFFICER GARY	Hey, you gotta sign the security log. Come on. I 

KARL	Don't take it personally, kid.

OFFICER GARY	Shit…

YARBROUGH	Whoa, whoa. Did I miss a jurisdiction reassignment, my friend?

BYRON	Nope. Just having a look. 

YARBROUGH	Oh, why do I get the feeling that you ain't being honest with me, Crawford? And that's no bueno at my crime scene.

BYRON	I'm being honest with you. I'm just out here 

REBECCA	Excuse me. Are you in charge here?

YARBROUGH	Hey, get these bozos out of here.

KARL	Hey, buddy.

KARL	We're the FBI.

YARBROUGH	Well, nice to meet y'all, but what the hell do you want at my crime scene? 

REBECCA	We target assholes who hunt underage,

REBECCA	potentially trafficked girls.

YARBROUGH	Okay, well, listen, I appreciate the efforts

YARBROUGH	that you're makin' in our little part of the world,

YARBROUGH	but why are we talking here?

REBECCA	We had set up a low-visibility prostitution sting here last night.

YARBROUGH	Well, the sheriff's office never mentioned anything to me.

KARL	It's not a perfect science. 

YARBROUGH	Well, obviously not, all right,

YARBROUGH	because I got a 20-year-old girl with her skull cracked in six places.

BYRON	This target last night. Do you have a name? 

YARBROUGH	Okay. No, no, no, this has gone far enough, all right? Protocol dictates that my lieutenant

YARBROUGH	talks to y'all's superior. Okay?

YARBROUGH	So quit while you're ahead, sweetheart.

YARBROUGH	(sighs)

REBECCA	I killed that girl.

KARL	I hope you're kidding.

REBECCA	No, I mean that. That should have been me. I'm supposed to be protecting these girls. 
KARL	Bullshit.

KARL	You could have died last night.

BYRON	Hi. My name is Byron Crawford,

BYRON	and I'm an agent with the FDLE.

BYRON	You said this target had no-showed a scheduled meeting before. Uh, when was that? 

KARL	Few nights ago.

KARL	The Oasis motel. 

BYRON	(sighs) 

KARL	Pensacola. 

BYRON	I was afraid of that. A young woman reported that her 16-year-old sister

BYRON	went missing Thursday night outside the Oasis.

BYRON	I'd love to hear anything else you got on this guy.

BYRON	If you remember anything else from that night or or, uh, get any additional info on the suspect,

BYRON	you know, give me a shout.

WOMAN	Today, we have a new invention.

WOMAN	What's your name today? 

MAN	That's right. We're going to a farm.

CHASITY	(groans)

PETER	(breathes heavily)

BETHANY	(chuckles)

PETER	Hi, baby. 

BETHANY	Working on the bookshelf? Mom will be so happy. 

PETER	Here, let me help you.

PETER	I love you, baby. 

BETHANY	I love you too, Daddy. 

PETER	I love you so much. Come on, let's go play. 

BETHANY	Mm-hm. 

PETER	All right. 

KARL	I think I saw that girl 

KARL	(voice-over) at the Oasis. (car beeping)

KARL	(voice-over) She was walking through the service center like a zombie. 

REBECCA	 How about you come in here and shake your ass, and I'll sit in the car and eat fucking burritos all night. 

KARL	(voice-over) I didn't think too much of it.

KARL	And then that assault came in.

KARL	Christ.

REBECCA	Well…

REBECCA	we'll get him tomorrow. 

PETER	Get up.

PETER	Wash your arms and legs off with the sponge.

TRACEY LEE	(shaking, crying) 

PETER	Do it…

PETER	(shouts) now!

TRACEY LEE	(sobbing) I can't see. I can't see.

PETER	It's right here, sweetheart. Here we go. Here we go. Come here. Okay.

TRACEY LEE	(shaking)

PETER	Is that better?

PETER	Use the sponge. Here. 

TRACEY LEE	(shaking)

BYRON	Hello.

REBECCA	Hey.

CHUCK	What can I get you, man? 

BYRON	I'll have what she's having, thanks.

BYRON	First time the FBI voluntarily showed up around this stretch, huh?

REBECCA	Doesn't seem to be a shortage of crime, does there?

BYRON	Well, I appreciate you reaching out.

BYRON	Let me give ya some background.

BYRON	Couple years ago, I got assigned two Jane Doe cases. Both drug-friendly truck stop prostitutes,

BYRON	(voice-over) both dumped off the I-10, (camera shutter clicks)

BYRON	(voice-over) both strangled,

BYRON	(voice-over) assaulted, bitten,

BYRON	and bodies suggestively staged in view from the highway.

BYRON	Now, nobody wanted to touch it. Just just an impossible to get around.

BYRON	And then another body turned up. (camera shutter clicks) 

BYRON	(voice-over) And then another.

BYRON	(voice-over) Until we had six

BYRON	and a bona fide serial killer.

REBECCA	Who worked that for the Bureau?

BYRON	(smirks) A whip-smart analyst with the State Bureau

BYRON	built a profile. FBI gave it to a behavioral specialist to confirm what we knew.

BYRON	White… 

REBECCA	Mm. 

BYRON	…male, truck driver, mid-30s, but nothing ground-breaking.

BYRON	Some people, they just think that the girls, ya know,

BYRON	they're hookers and druggies that… they got what they had comin.'

REBECCA	What do you believe?

BYRON	Hard luck in life don't make you any less of a human. Everybody needs a chance to get… back on their feet.

BYRON	A few days ago, a body was discovered

BYRON	up by the state line,

BYRON	(voice-over) same M.O. to a T.

BYRON	(voice-over) And then last night at the motel. 

BYRON	It it was still him, but it was just rushed and improvised…

REBECCA	Why the break in routine? 

BYRON	Honestly…

BYRON	I kind of think he was looking for you. But my question is, why?

REBECCA	We started communicating a few weeks ago through our online ad.

REBECCA	(voice-over) Decided to meet up at a motel in Loxley. 

REBECCA	Some locals jumped prematurely, started making arrests. I didn't blow my cover.

REBECCA	After a little more e-flirting, we decided to meet up at the Oasis a few nights ago and some low-level pimp spooked him off.

REBECCA	He stayed on me though. 

REBECCA	We were supposed to meet at the Mustang last night.

BYRON	He'll be long gone by now.

REBECCA	I can set him up again.

BYRON	That's too dangerous. That'll never get authorization. 

REBECCA	You just said that you think he's looking for me.

REBECCA	He's gonna wanna try again.

REBECCA	Do you think the girl that disappeared from the Oasis

REBECCA	is still alive? 

BYRON	I don't know. Maybe.

REBECCA	Okay then, who reported her missing? 

BYRON	I got a call from her sister, Heather Walls. 

REBECCA	Heather? 

HEATHER	Hm. 

REBECCA	I'm the one that called.

HEATHER	Are you a cop? 

REBECCA	I'm just here to help. You brought her here? 

HEATHER	I didn't have a choice.

HEATHER	I borrowed some money from people that I thought was my friends. And boom. Next thing you know, I'm here. You know, I was told I gotta pay it off, you know.

HEATHER	It's not totally bad all the time, but it's not for no 16-year-old. That's what I told him. Said she's off limits. That shit didn't last long.

REBECCA	Who?

HEATHER	Skinny fuck who runs this place. Calvin. 

REBECCA	Thursday… the last night that you saw your sister?

HEATHER	Yeah. Calvin got us girls fucked up on somethin' nasty

HEATHER	and had all these guys come over. 

WALTON	Shut the fucking door, bitch. 

HEATHER	Said it was a group thing. All I remember is telling Tracey to get the fuck outta here. 

HEATHER	(echoing) Tracey, get out of here. 

HEATHER	So she left, and never come back. 

REBECCA	Where does Calvin stay? 

HEATHER	The room at the far end,

HEATHER	since the accident. Got busted up in a car crash.

HEATHER	It's kinda funny. 

REBECCA	Hah.

HEATHER	Will you find her for me? 

REBECCA	Yeah. I'm just gonna go and have a chat with Calvin.

TRACEY LEE	(crying)

TRACEY LEE	You-you-you said that

TRACEY LEE	if I'm quiet, that if I'm good, that you'd let me go. 

PETER	Okay, girl. Hey, you bein' a good girl now? Oh, sweetheart… you got nowhere to go.

PETER	You're better off here with me. 

TRACEY LEE	(weeping) How can you do this? (sniffles) Youyou have a daughter.

TRACEY LEE	I know you do. I-I've heard her voice. 

TRACEY LEE	Hey! Don't you talk about my daughter!

TRACEY LEE	(groans)

PETER	Don't talk about my daughter.

PETER	She was sent to this earth to absolve me of my sins and bless me with a greater understanding of eternal holy love. 

TRACEY LEE	(crying)

PETER	Let it out. 

TRACEY LEE	(crying) 

PETER	I know. I know. Just let it out. Let it out. It's all right. 

TRACEY LEE	(crying) 

PETER	Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

TRACEY LEE	(muffled crying) 

PETER	That's right.

PETER	I would never do this to my daughter.

TRACEY LEE	(crying, shaking)

CALVIN	What?

REBECCA	(country twang) Um, Stacy, she told me to come see you like 'bout a job or somethin'?

CALVIN	Who the fuck is Stacy?

CALVIN	(grunts)

REBECCA	You gotta be the stupidest motherfucker

REBECCA	in all of Pensacola.

REBECCA	I thought you'd be long gone by now.

CALVIN	What the fuck, lady? 

REBECCA	I'm only gonna ask you this one fucking time.

REBECCA	Who did you send away Thursday night?

CALVIN	What?

REBECCA	You said you sent my date packin' Thursday. Who was he?

CALVIN	The fuck if I know. I was high, man.

REBECCA	How many girls' lives could I save right now? 

CALVIN	All right. He was a truck driver who's been around a couple of times. That's all I know.

CALVIN	All right, I-I went up to him, asked him what the fuck was up and he pulled off quick.

CALVIN	Big Dallas told me he had some new girl in 106, so I went up who it was. And you know what the fuck happened. 

REBECCA	What's he look like?

CALVIN	A white truck driver. 

REBECCA	Who does he drive for?

CALVIN	How the fuck should I know? 

REBECCA	Fucking think, you tweaker.

CALVIN	Okay. I-I had someone point him out. He he tried to cuff one of my girls.

CALVIN	That's it. Lightnin' bolt. He had a lightnin' bolt on his truck. It's a pickup.

REBECCA	If you're not gone in three days, I'm gonna kill you.

CALVIN	My daddy never beat my mama, all right?

REBECCA	What? 

CALVIN	You said I used to watch my daddy throw my mama

CALVIN	around the trailer and shit. Only thing I ever saw my dad do is put a 12-gauge to his head and blow his brains out in the bathtub. I was eight.

REBECCA	My mom sat in the station wagon in our garage until the gas ran out.

REBECCA	We all got excuses, Calvin. ("Worship" performed by Homie Chris playing) 

SONG	She say her body is a temple 

REBECCA	Three days.

SONG	Now I'mma break it down real simple 

SONG	If you go inside she controlling your mental Damn it's intense

SONG	Flip my world upside down ("Our Love" performed by Kyle Lalone playing) 

SONG	Our love ain't what it used to be… 

REBECCA	Man. So is this is the nicest place you could find for a going-away meal? 

WAITRESS	There you go.

WAITRESS	How about you, ma'am? 

KARL	Thank you. 

REBECCA	I'm good. Thank you.

KARL	Looks like you're feeling better.

REBECCA	Not as good as you. You look like a giddy fucking schoolgirl.

KARL	(chuckles)

REBECCA	Last couple of days have, uh, stirred up some shit for me, though, I'll be honest.

REBECCA	And, um, (clears throat)

REBECCA	when I was a freshman, I got myself into a bad situation. And I'll spare you all the gory details, but basically it involved an upperclassman, too much booze, and some internal bleeding.

REBECCA	My best friend got worried, and she told her mom,

REBECCA	and her mom told my dad, and then it became a family issue.

KARL	He was a cop, right? 

REBECCA	Mm-hm. He went after that kid and his whole family.

REBECCA	He lost his job.

REBECCA	And, uh, that's when my parents got divorced.

KARL	I had no idea. 

REBECCA	Well, maybe if you asked somebody about their life

REBECCA	every once in a while, you'd know this shit. 

KARL	(laughing)

KARL	Fair enough. 

REBECCA	He and I actually

REBECCA	started taking Taekwondo classes together after school.

REBECCA	Winning tournaments gave me something to talk to him about

REBECCA	and something to share and… uh, gave me a way to make him happy.

KARL	I think you should leave too.

REBECCA	We are leaving. 

KARL	Leave the operation. Get reassigned. Let me help you.

KARL	I know this shit bothers you.

REBECCA	Oh, you do? You listen to my sad story for two fucking minutes, and all of a sudden, you think you should tell me what I should be doing?

REBECCA	Fuck that. I-I like doing this shit.

REBECCA	I like having the opportunity to blast these motherfuckers. I know why you're fucking leaving.

KARL	What the fuck are you talking about? 

REBECCA	You're leaving because you're weak,

REBECCA	but don't project that shit onto me.

KARL	You wanna know the truth?

KARL	You're fuckin' toxic.

KARL	If I stay,

KARL	you're gonna get me killed.

KARL	Good luck in Seattle.

BYRON	These are going to work like shit in there.

REBECCA	Yeah, he told me he's going to be wearing a plaid shirt and some jeans.

REBECCA	I'm supposed to meet him at the bar at ten.

BYRON	I don't like this.

BYRON	This is an uncontrollable environment. 

REBECCA	Yeah, but we don't need control.

REBECCA	All we need is, you know, a fingerprint on a beer bottle, a cigarette butt, a strand of hair.

BYRON	The Handlebar is one of the wildest spots in the panhandle.

REBECCA	Okay, just don't blow your cover if some guy grabs my ass.

BYRON	Huh.

BYRON	I'm in position. No sign at the bar.

BYRON	(into earpiece) Listen, we don't want any fucked-up shit.

DRUNK BIKER	Hey baby. Wanna free mustache ride?

BYRON	(into earpiece) Oh, you do.

REBECCA	Mm. 

DRUNK BIKER	(groans)

BYRON	No, you took the wind out of that motherfucker out there.

BYRON	I told you to behave. 

BARTENDER	This is on me.

BARTENDER	We're always looking for a new bouncer.

BYRON	I think I got a possible hit.

BYRON	(indistinct) wearing flannel. He is right across

BYRON	the bar from you.

BYRON	Oh, shit. I think he made me.

BYRON	I'm gonna go after him. All right.

BYRON	All right, he's moving. Hold your position.

BYRON	Hey! Hey, wait up.

BYRON	Hey, wait up! I want to talk to you a sec.

PETER	Can I get a beer, please? Thank you.

BARTENDER	Last one for you, buddy. 

DRUNK MAN	Whoo!

DRUNK MAN	Yeah. 

CROWD	(cheering and applause)

PETER	It's the best live music in north county to me, but the patrons leave a lot to be desired.

BYRON	I said, wait up. I wanna talk to you.

SUSPECT	Bro, what the fuck is (grunts) 

BYRON	State police. Don't move.

PETER	You sure do look familiar. Have we met?

REBECCA	I'm just passing through. 

PETER	All right. Are you sure?

PETER	Cause I'd never forget such a pretty face. Cheers.

SUSPECT	I didn't do nothin', man. Why you chasin' me? 

BYRON	Why are you runnin'?

SUSPECT	It ain't mine, man.

SUSPECT	Just holdin' it for my cousin.

SUSPECT	Just a drop, man. 

BYRON	What?

BYRON	Get the hell out of here, all right?

BYRON	Suspect not the target.

BYRON	Cover could be blown. Repeat. Cover could be blown. Lombardo, 

BYRON	do you copy?

PETER	Now, they got this funny little motel down in Loxley…

PETER	off the I-10.

PETER	It's called the Loxley Piper Inn. Quite the eccentric place, do you know I'm saying? 

REBECCA	Excuse me.

REBECCA	Where's your closest bathroom? (echoing)

BYRON	Lombardo! Lombardo!

BYRON	Lombardo! 

PETER	Your best bet to avoid a line is right there. 

PETER	I'll keep your seat warm for you.

BYRON	Excuse me. Hey, police.

BYRON	Step aside. Excuse me, police. 

WOMAN	Come on.

BYRON	Look out. Watch it.

REBECCA	Crawford, I made contact with target.

BOUNCER	Yo, asshole, what do you think you're doing?

BOUNCER	All right, let him in.

REBECCA	(breathing deep)

PETER	Just hang on to my (echoing) arm.

BYRON	Lombardo, answer me! Lombardo, do you copy? 

BYRON	Hey, hey. Hey, you see that woman with the long black jacket? Dark-dark-dark brown hair.

BYRON	Did you see her? 

BEAU	Hey, every five minutes. 

BYRON	Shit! Fuckin' A.

BEAU	Yo. 

BYRON	What? 

BEAU	Actually, I saw her. She was all fucked up. She could hardly walk. She left with some dude.

BYRON	With who? 

BEAU	Her brother. I don't know.

BYRON	She don't have a fucking brother. She ain't fucking leave with her fucking brother! (indistinct). 

BEAU	Hey, hey!

BYRON	God damn you! (echoing) Fuck!

BYRON	(panting) 

REBECCA	(over answering machine) Hi. 

BYRON	Lombardo? 

REBECCA	(over answering machine) This is Lombardo. I'm sorry I can't get to the phone right now, but leave a message.

SUZANNA	Byron. 

BYRON	Oh, hey, honey.

SUZANNA	Baby, are you comin' home? Our baby's so fussy. 

BYRON	Oh, she's got a fever, huh? All right, well 

SUZANNA	Yes, I need you. Please. 

BYRON	I'm working late tonight, but I'mI'm gonna come by the house, all right? 

SUZANNA	Really, baby? Why? 

BYRON	I'm gonna see you soon. I'm gonna pick up a few things, all right? 

SUZANNA	Okay. 

BYRON	All right. I love you. 

SUZANNA	I love you. Bye. 

SONG	Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power? Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

SONG	Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour? 

PETER	(humming)

SONG	Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb? Are you washed in the blood?

PETER	(echoing) Well, look who's waking up. 

REBECCA	(grunting) 

PETER	Not quite time yet, though.

REBECCA	(grunting, muffled cry)

SONG	Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin 

REBECCA	(groaning) 

SONG	And be washed in the blood of the Lamb

SONG	There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean 

SONG	Oh, be washed in the blood of the Lamb!

SUZANNA	I'm not goin' through this again, Byron James. 

SUZANNA	We agreed that when I got pregnant that this family would come first.

SUZANNA	We we agreed that that little girl would come first. I don't mind bein' here

SUZANNA	all day caring for your sick baby

SUZANNA	because I know that you're going to walk through that door every night.

SUZANNA	But you gotta promise me to always walk through that door.

SUZANNA	You gotta promise me that you won't leave Bella and me alone, baby. 

BYRON	Hey, hey, baby, baby, baby. Hey, I promise, okay? I promise. I'll be back, okay? 

SUZANNA	(sniffles)

BYRON	But you need to trust me right now. And I need to go. I need to do my job.

BYRON	I'll be back, all right? That's how we do it, me and you.

TRUCK DRIVER	(laughs)

CUSTOMER	Hey, you ever heard of (indistinct)? 

FRED	Enjoy. 

CUSTOMER	Take care. 

BYRON	(panting) Hey, Fred.

FRED	Byron, what brings you out this way? 

BYRON	A bit of time-sensitive business.

FRED	Mm-hm.

FRED	What can I do to help?

BYRON	I need to see your video of that altercation Thursday night from outside your overnight lot. 

FRED	I gave that to the police very next morning.

FRED	Can't one of them local yokels help you out? 

BYRON	I don't need to see

BYRON	the Mohawk's cameras, Fred. I need to see your cameras. 

FRED	(laughs) Byron, I don't know what you're talking about.

FRED	I only got one set of cameras here.

BYRON	How long we known each other for, Fred? 

FRED	Since high school, I reckon.

BYRON	And during that time, I've looked the other way on all types of bullshit that's come crawling out of this godforsaken cesspool under your watch, Fred.

BYRON	And I never said a goddamn thing or asked for anything in return, okay? Now that's mostly because I never liked you and this whole operation makes my skin crawl.

BYRON	But I'm coming to you now. And I am asking you personally for a favor. Now it's fair to assume I'd owe you one.

FRED	(into intercom) Mills, can you hold down the gas station?

MILLS	Sure, no problem. 

FRED	Follow me.

FRED	Okay, okay, right here. Okay, this fat guy gets a little handsy with that hooker.

FRED	And then boom. This guy blasts him from behind. 

BYRON	Wait, wait. Stop it there.

BYRON	Who's that? 

FRED	The hell if I know. 

BYRON	Wh-where do they go? Where does he take her?

FRED	I don't know. It's kind of weird. They just disappeared.

BYRON	No, no, no, wait…

BYRON	wait, wait. Stop it. There. That truck on your record, uh, what freight company is that?

FRED	It looks like Southern Harbor. Yep, that's their flag.

BYRON	Whoo. Thank you, Fred. All right.

REBECCA	(breathing deeply) (grunting, panting)

REBECCA	(groaning)

REBECCA	(breathing rapidly)

REBECCA	Fuck.

REBECCA	(grunting) 

REBECCA	(groaning)

REBECCA	(panting) Shit.

REBECCA	Fucking pervert.

BYRON	Hello? 

CLAUDIA	Can I help you? 

BYRON	I'm not sure. My name is Byron Crawford, and I'm with the FDLE.

BYRON	I'm trying to locate a Southern Harbor driver who

CLAUDIA	That will be our customer service department on the other side of the dock.

BYRON	I was just hopin' you got logs from last week,

BYRON	and see who might have passed through the Mohawk on I-10 last Thursday evening. You know, I know they got that weigh station 

CLAUDIA	Let me stop you right there, Mr. Crawford.

CLAUDIA	I know what you're doin'.

CLAUDIA	So, I suggest you get a court order, and I might be able to help. 

BYRON	But, ma'am.

CLAUDIA	I can appreciate

CLAUDIA	the thankless and difficult nature of your job, Mr. Crawford, but I will not get stuck explaining to my boss

CLAUDIA	how this information was obtained

CLAUDIA	outside the letter of the law.

BYRON	I completely understand, ma'am. I-I appreciate you explaining your predicament.

CLAUDIA	I appreciate you understanding.

BYRON	You know, my predicament is that seven times in the past 26 months,

BYRON	I've sat down with family members to deliver them the news that their daughters, granddaughters, nieces,

BYRON	sisters, wives, and mothers

BYRON	have been brutally murdered and dumped like garbage along Interstate 10.

BYRON	I-I can't drive out to another family and deliver that news again. (sniffles)

BYRON	He hurts women, ma'am. He hurts girls.

BYRON	And he's hurting some… right now.

CLAUDIA	Just give me a minute, Mr. Crawford, okay?

PETER	Not your fragrance.

PETER	That color sure does look good on you, though. (inhales deep) Hm. You're a smart one, huh?

PETER	That's okay. I kinda like the smart ones.

BYRON	Shit.

BYRON	(sighs deeply)

PETER	You like that dress? It belonged to a friend of mine a few years ago.

PETER	She sold the most beautiful flowers from this little roadside stand. 

PATRICIA	Flowers, sir?

PETER	Man. She was so pretty. 

REBECCA	(sobbing)

PETER	She made me this little cute bouquet 

PETER	to give to my wife.

PETER	I kept the dress for myself.

PETER	But you can have it. 

REBECCA	(panting) 

PETER	I want you to have it.

PETER	That's all right.

PETER	That's all right. Ssshhh. Get some sleep. You're gonna need it.

BYRON	Aw, shit. 

CLAUDIA	Hey, any luck?

BYRON	No. I couldn't find one driver that logged on to that stretch of the I-10 after 10:00 a.m. last Thursday.

BYRON	Are you sure this is everybody that drove on Thursday? 

CLAUDIA	Yeah.

BYRON	I truly appreciate your willingness to help.

BYRON	Have a good night. 

CLAUDIA	You too. 

BYRON	Hey, babe. 

SUZANNA	Byron? 

BYRON	How you doin'? 

SUZANNA	I need you here.

SUZANNA	You promised our baby. 

BYRON	She's still not feeling better, huh? 

SUZANNA	No, she's not. 

BYRON	Urgent care should be open soon. 

SUZANNA	I need you here. 

BYRON	All right. 

SUZANNA	I love you. 

BYRON	I'll be home soon. I love you. 

SUZANNA	Please take care of yourself, all right? 

BYRON	What if a driver calls in sick? The load just doesn't sit, right? 

CLAUDIA	Of course not. Another driver picks it up

CLAUDIA	or we have a temp driver. 

BYRON	But it would show up on that list? 

CLAUDIA	Yeah, or they wouldn't get paid.

CLAUDIA	You know, but sometimes, supervisors, if they've previously been drivers before,

CLAUDIA	they'll step in and run the load.

BYRON	But they would show up on that log. 

CLAUDIA	No. Managers are salaried, so they don't have to submit a timesheet log. 

CLAUDIA	(gasps) Well, how do you like that?

BYRON	What? 

CLAUDIA	One of our drivers has been

CLAUDIA	out on medical leave. A temp has run their load for the past two weeks, but not Thursday.

CLAUDIA	A manager signed for the load. 

BYRON	Who?

CLAUDIA	Peter Hillborough.

BETHANY	Hi, Daddy!

BETHANY	Cutting up some wood before dinner? 

PETER	Hey there, buttercup. What ya doin' down here? 

BETHANY	I want to help with the work.

PETER	Oh…oh, I appreciate that, honey. Look, you know the equipment in the shed is very, very dangerous.

BETHANY	I know. I know. 

PETER	All right. I just wouldn't want one of those saws to cut your little arm off. 

BETHANY	(chuckles)

PETER	All right. Come on, let's go. Dinner's gonna be ready soon. 

BETHANY	Mm-hm.

REBECCA	(breathing loud) Hello? Is somebody there?

REBECCA	Tracey? Tracey, are you in here?

REBECCA	Fuck. Tracey, please tell me that you're in here.

REBECCA	I talked to Heather. (lighter clicks)

REBECCA	She misses you so much.

REBECCA	She wants you to come back really bad.

REBECCA	Tracey? 

TRACEY LEE	You saw my sister?

REBECCA	Yes. You see, babe, you are…

REBECCA	Are you okay? Are you hurt? 

TRACEY LEE	I don't know. (sobbing) My hand and my stomach hurt so bad. He puts a needle in me every night, and then I can't move. 

REBECCA	Tracey. I need you to listen to me very carefully, okay?

REBECCA	I need you to do absolutely everything that you can to get out right now.

TRACEY LEE	I can't. I can't. He locked me in here. 

REBECCA	There has to be a way out.

REBECCA	This is life and death.

TRACEY LEE	I can't.

REBECCA	He's gonna kill you tonight. Then he's gonna put me in that fucking thing. So I need you to do this, okay? I need you to do it for Heather

REBECCA	cause she loves you. I know you're tired, but you're so strong and you're going to do this… because Heather needs you to. Okay? 

TRACEY LEE	(sniffles) Okay.

TRACEY LEE	(grunts)

BETHANY	Next Saturday? You promise?

PETER	I promise.

PETER	Zoo, Willy T's, and the Creamery. It's a date. 

BETHANY	It's a date.

PETER	Okay. 

TRACEY LEE	(panting, groaning)

PETER	It's time for you to get some sleep, and I'm gonna go to work.

PETER	Mwah. 

TRACEY LEE	Ah! (breathing heavily)

TRACEY LEE	(groaning loud) 

BETHANY	I love you, Daddy.

PETER	I love you too, baby.

TRACEY LEE	(groaning)

PETER	See you in my dreams.

BETHANY	All right.

PETER	Get out of those clothes. Put your PJs on for once. 

BETHANY	(giggles)

BETHANY	Somebody's outside. Running through the field. (tense music)

BYRON	Lucky for them, huh?

KARL	You are the toughest son of a bitch

KARL	I've ever known.

SONG	When your world is lost and you're on your own   And the summer's gone away  

SONG	 If the lights go out 

SONG	 And the sun should fall

SONG	And there's nowhere left to stay

SONG	If you're calling out 'cause your hope is lost

SONG	And you're fallin' on the way

SONG	Maybe heaven

SONG	Is callin' you home

SONG	Maybe heaven

SONG	Is callin' you home
