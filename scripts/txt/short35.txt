THOMAS	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER	Ivan and Frieda were on their way home from the Great Race.

STORYTELLER	And wherever they went, people were always very excited about seeing Ivan. 'Hooray! It's Ivan!' They cheered. 'Ivan the super shunter!'  

STORYTELLER	But this made Frieda very grumpy. She wanted them to be excited because she was there. 

STORYTELLER	'Ivan can shunt... but he's not as strong or as fast as me!' Said Frieda.

STORYTELLER	'So Ivan, how did you do at the Great Railway Show?' said one man. 'Did you win the shunting competition?' said another.

STORYTELLER	This made Frieda so grumpy, she puffed away.

STORYTELLER	'Don't worry,' said Ivan. 'I'm sure everyone is just as happy to see you!' 'They will be!' Snapped Frieda. 'Especially when we get to my home in Germany!'

STORYTELLER 	But even when they got to Germany, it was Ivan who got all the cheers.

STORYTELLER	'Hello everyone!' Said Ivan. 'So nice to meet you!' This made Frieda very unhappy.

STORYTELLER	'I don't understand,' said Frieda. 'Why is everyone so happy to see you, but not me!' 'I think maybe it's cos I smile,' said Ivan. 'But I smile!' said Frieda. 'Ummmm... Not so much...' said Ivan.

STORYTELLER	So the next morning Ivan decided to teach Frieda how to give her best smile. 

STORYTELLER	'Bigger smile!' Said Ivan. 'And be cheerful too!'

STORYTELLER	'I think maybe you need to practice...' said Ivan.

STORYTELLER	Frieda practiced smiling and being cheerful as they puffed through the German countryside. And when they arrived in the next town...

STORYTELLER	Everyone was happy to see Ivan...

STORYTELLER	AND Frieda! 'You know what?' Said Frieda. 'I'm going to try to be cheerful all the time!'

STORYTELLER	'Da! Good!' Said Ivan. 'A happy engine is a useful engine!'

THOMAS	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
