AMBASSADOR	I am confident my daughter will appreciate some female company.

NIRA	How come there are so many cars with us today? 

ALI	To make sure you and your mommy remain super safe.

NIRA	Can I have another piece of candy?

ALI	Give me your radio.

ALI	We may have a situation. Movement in woods 3 o’clock.

LAUGHLIN	All clear. 

LAUGHLIN	No need to worry Sergeant.

LAUGHLIN	Oh shit.

LAUGHLIN	Johnson. Take the lead. 

LAUGHLIN	Go. Go. Go.

NIRA	AMBASSADOR Is Nira alright?

LAUGHLIN	Dove status?

SECURITY OFFICER	Secure.

NIRA	Ali....	

ALI	Nothing is going to happen to you.

AMBASSADOR	How is my daughter!?

AMBASSADOR 	Ali....

ALI	She’s secure....

ALI	Stay down!!! Open the shotgun side of your rear door.

ALI	Open your door!!! Keep your head down.

ALI	Climb in. Now!

ALI	Stop. I want to get out.

ALI	PULL OVER!

CABBIE	Something is wrong?

ALI	PULL OVER. NOW!!!

SALES LADY	Hello! I hope you don’t mind me saying, but you have beautiful cheekbones.

SALES LADY	But you’re not highlighting them properly. Sit down.

SALES LADY	I’m sure you’ve heard about this new tinted moisturizer. It’s oilfree so it prevents shine. Don’t you just hate it when your face is too shiny?

ALI	Excuse me.

PHIL	This will just take a second. I’m in a hurry.

ALI	We’ve been...

ALARMED SHOPPER	Security!!

ALI	Sorry. I’m-- Sorry.

GUARD	Gorski, Alexandra.

ALI	Uncle Pat?

ALI	How did you...?

PAT	Friends in high places. 

PAT	Mac - the Desk Sergeant - is an old friend. We were in the same unit. He saw your file, knew all about you from stories I’d told. He made a call. 

ALI	Those must have been some stories. I can catch the A train from here.

PAT	Can I buy you a drink?

UNCLE PAT	When’d you get out?

ALI	A while ago. 

UNCLE PAT	And then?

ALI	Traveled around a bit.

PAT	When’d you get back?

ALI	To New York? About a week. 

PAT	You have a place to stay?

PAT	What about a job?

ALI	There wasn’t exactly a parade welcoming me home.

UNCLE PAT	We missed you at the funeral.

ALI	They wouldn’t let me go.

UNCLE PAT	For your sister?

ALI	Non sibi sed patriae. Not Self, but Country - and all that. 

UNCLE PAT	That’s Navy, not us.

ALI	Seemed to make sense at the time. 

UNCLE PAT	The kids would benefit from having a woman around. Any interest in seeing them? Jon?

PAT	There’s an opening at the apartment building where I work. Not much but it’s something. 

PAT	They’re doing major renovations, so if you get the job hardly anyone’ll be there. Not quite as exciting as where you’ve been.

ALI	That sounds just fine.

ALI	I should get going.

PAT	You know when we fought in Vietnam we saw things... After the war the only people who really understood what we went through were other soldiers. There are groups you could talk to...

ALI	No worries. I’m fine. I’ll check out this job. 

ALI	I owe you a couple a Mets tickets.

PAT	Not til they have a team worth watching. 

ALI	Where do I find Borz Blasevic?

PAT	In the locker room. Take the service elevator to the basement. Turn left through the fire doors. You’ll see it. Don’t tell him we’re related. He’ll go easier on you.

ALI	Hey Uncle Pat... Thanks.

BORZ	You Gorski?

ALI	Yes, sir.

BORZ	Pat told me you were coming. He’s quite the personality don’t you think?

ALI	I do, sir.

BORZ	Cut the “sir” crap. We’ve got enough kissing up to do here. We don’t need to do it to each other.

BORZ	Thing I like about Stravinsky is he’s so - unexpected.

ALI	Feel the same way about Dylan.

BORZ	Thomas?

ALI	Bob.

BORZ	We’ll use the next two days to get you acclimated then you can take the Easter weekend off. Everyone’ll be out of the building so you won’t miss much. When you start on Monday it’ll be more baby-sitting the Carrington while it gets a face lift. Think you can handle that?

ALI	I’ll do my best, sir.

FATHER	Hey!  I may be old fashioned but a woman doorman?! 

BORZ	We’re trying to modernize our image at the Carrington, Sir.

ALI	Here. Let me help you with those.

MRS. HERSCH	I’ve got them.

ALI	I insist.

MRS. HERSCH	Thank you, dear. You must stop by tomorrow for some pumpkin pie. It’s my husband’s favorite recipe.

ALI	You’re not moving during the remodeling?

MRS. HERSCH	Oh no. Borz was kind enough to arrange an exception for us.

ALI	But they’ll be reinforcing the entire building. Won’t the noise alone bother you?

MRS. HERSCH	I’ve been living in New York for over 30 years. What’s a little more noise going to do? 

MRS. HERSCH	Poor Bernhard had a stroke seven years ago and moving’s just too hard. You know how old fogies feel about change. 

ALI	Old fogies? You’re not so old...

MRS. HERSCH	You’re kind. A liar - but kind nevertheless. 

MRS. HERSCH	That was a great help, dear. Your sister never stopped talking about you. Now I know why.

ALI	My sister?! How do you know my sister?

MRS. HERSCH	You’re Ali right? Your sister and family lived in the building. Her husband and kids still do. 

ALI	Where is he?

MRS. HERSCH	10C. Lovely family, but tragic what they’ve lived through.

MRS. HERSCH	Have a happy Easter.

ALI	Why didn’t you tell me?

PAT	I was going to. I thought being close to family might --

JON	Max! Get the door!

MAX	I’m busy! 

JON	Max! I swear to God, I’m going to throw that game out the window!

MAX	What.

ALI	Is your father home?

MAX	It’s for you!

JON	Ali...

ALI	What the hell’s going on?

JON	You tell me. You’re working here?!

ALI	You’re not behind this? (he’s clueless) Then who is?

JON	Uncle Pat?

JON	Do you want to come in?

ALI	No.

JON	He told me you were back and in a jam. I’m sure he just wanted to help. 

ALI	No one asked him for it.

JON	Believe me, I had no idea you were going to end up here...

LILY	Jasper! Damnit!

JON	Lily... language.

LILY	We have to find him! 

JON	I’ve got to get this. It’s my publisher in London. We’ve been missing all morning. Can we talk later?

ALI	Do you need help? 

LILY	Jasper could be anywhere by now. We need Max.

LILY	No one knows The Carrington like Max. He’ll help us.

MAX	o away!

MAX	Lily, what the hell!

LILY	It stinks in here.

MAX	Get out!

LILY	Jasper escaped again. We need your help.

MAX	I don’t have time to look for your stupid cat.

LILY	If you don’t help us I’m going to tell dad you’re smoking marijuana again.

MAX	There are 63 apartments on ten floors - and all of ’em are open for the contractor. This is going to take forever.

LILY	Max collected all the blue prints for the Carrington when he was a boy scout.

MAX	Zip it, Lily.

ALI	Max a boy scout? I can see that.

LILY	Jasper!

ALI	Where’d your brother go?

LILY	Max?

LILY	Butt brain!

ALI	Where’d you come from?

MAX	Secret door. The building is full of them. 

MAX	The servants used them to get from room to room. 

LILY	What’s your name, anyhow?

ALI	Ali.

LILY	Aunt Ali? us all about you.

ALI	She did?

ALI	So how do we find Jasper?

MAX	Jasper? Not in the mail room. Earth to Jasper...Jasper?

LILY	That’s him. He’s in the basement

LILY	Jasper!

ALI	What’s that?

MAX	There were building a subway tunnel under The Carrington. They ran out of money in the 40’s. 

LILY	That’s Jasper!

ALI	Give me your phone.

LILY	What do we do?

LILY	I didn’t think we’d ever see Jasper again, but then Aunt Ali dropped into the hole like Spiderman and saved him!

JON	Your Aunt was always filled with surprises. Go in and get started on your mommy’s mint sauce, I’ll join you in a minute.

LILY	Will you come for Easter dinner tomorrow. I’m cooking it.

ALI	I’d like that Lily but...

JON	You’ve got to eat. It’ll give us a chance to... reconnect.

ALI	I don’t want to re...

JON	I’m taking the kids back to the UK on Monday during construction. You’ll have the building to 
	yourself without us. Only reason we 	stayed this long was Lily wanted to make an Easter dinner like her mother did. Kate passed a couple of years ago. 

ALI	I know... We hadn’t been in touch... I didn’t know what to say... 

ALI	Is Uncle Pat coming?

JON	He doesn’t like the fuss of the holidays. He prefers a little Irish whiskey and watching the ballgame at home. It’s an annual ritual. 	

LILY	Please, Ali. Come. Ali considers the offer...

BORZ	Pat, your shift was over an hour ago. Don’t you have an Easter feast waiting for you somewhere?  

PAT	I told Mrs. Hersch I’d fix her microwave before I left.

BORZ	I’m sure she’ll understand. It’s a holiday. Get outta here.

PAT	I don’t want to disappoint her.

BORZ	That’s thoughtful, Pat. You want some coffee?

PAT	Sure.

BORZ	I told you you should take the holiday off.

ALI	I was invited to dinner by the Stantons.

BORZ	You work fast.

ALI	Sheer force of my personality.

BORZ	Really. 

ALI	They’re expecting me.

BORZ	You guys going out?

ALI	Not quite. Home cooked meal. Trust me. I’d welcome any excuse to duck out of this but I promised, so...  

ALI	You want me to bring you some pie? It’s fresh from the deli.

BORZ	Thanks. No. I’m watching my figure.

DUBOIS	Shall we begin? Borz locks the door as the Mercenaries split in different directions.

MARTINEZ	Back doors secure.

PEE-WEE	Jammer’s set. Good to go.

LEO	Phone lines and fire alarm disabled. Let’s rock and roll!

ALI 	What’s this?

LILY	Something I made for you.

ALI	Oh Lily... This is beautiful. How did you draw this? It looks just like me.

LILY	I used the picture of you and Daddy.

ALI	Where’d you find this?!

LILY	It was in Daddy’s memory book. Don’t you like it?

ALI	No no, I do. This is - just great, Lily. Thanks. 

ALI	I’m going to put this up here so we can all enjoy it. Where’s your father?

LILY	He’s busy. 

MAX	He’s always busy.

ALI	Do you know what water wings are?

LILY	Daddy made me wear them when I learned to swim.

ALI	You know the lake in   near your daddy’s home? Well, your grandma made him wear water wings whenever he went out to play in case he fell in. It’s true. I saw a photo of your daddy wearing them. So whenever you get mad at your daddy just imagine him wearing water wings.

JON	Sorry, but I had that deadline. Finally got my publishers off my back. What are you doing? Help your sister. 

JON	Did I miss anything?

ALI	Nope.

MRS. HERSCH	That must be Pat to fix the microwave.

MRS. HERSCH	Borz! Happy Easter! What can I do for you?

BORZ	You have a visitor.

MRS. HERSCH	I wasn’t expecting one.

BORZ	It’s an old friend of your husband.


MRS. HERSCH	A friend of Bernhard’s?

DUBOIS	Good evening. My name is Victor Dubois. I happened to be in town briefly for the holiday and wanted to stop by. I hope this isn’t too much of an inconvenience.

MRS. HERSCH	Of course not. Come in, come in... Can I get you anything? Some tea? We have plenty of food.

DUBOIS	Some tea would be delightful. Thank you.

MRS. HERSCH	Borz?

DUBOIS 	Ah, my old friend, you have no idea how happy I am to see you again.

MRS. HERSCH 	Bernhard hardly says a word since the stroke. The doctors say it triggered “akinetic mutism” - whatever that is. Such a shame. How do you know my husband, Mr. Dubois?

DUBOIS	We worked together in Berlin over thirty years ago.

MRS. HERSCH	My Bernhard? That can’t be.

DUBOIS	He went by the name of Erik Dreschler then.

MRS. HERSCH	Oh dear, I think you have the wrong person.

DUBOIS	I’m afraid not.

DUBOIS	You know why I’m here, Erik. Where are they? Make this easy on yourself and tell me.

MRS. HERSCH	Mr. Dubois, my husband doesn’t speak French. He’s never even been to Europe.

MRS. HERSCH	Borz. What is this about?

BORZ	Please sit down, Mrs. Hersch. It seems there’s a lot you don’t know about your husband.

JON	So what was it like over there?

ALI	Great.

MAX	Did you kill anyone?

JON	Max! Don’t be an imbecile. That’s totally out of line. ALI It’s okay. Yes. I did.

MAX	Cool.

ALI	Any more wine?

JON	I’ll open another bottle.

MAX	Water wings.

JON	What?

MAX	Nothing.

LILY	I just wish everything could go back to the way 

ALI	How long do we put the green beans in for?

LILY	Fifteen minutes. 

DUBOIS	Dreschler. I know everything.

DUBOIS	Between 1995 and 2005 you sold four paintings. You made the shipments  right here from The Carrington. Where are the rest? I know they’re here.

MRS. HERSCH	I told you. We don’t know anything. You’ve made a mistake.

BORZ	Would you like some help. 

DUBOIS	Not yet. Tell me where the paintings are and I promise I will not harm you and your wife. 

BORZ	How about now?

DUBOIS	Refresh his memory.

MRS. HERSCH	Bernhard! My god!

BORZ	He’s a tough old guy.

MRS. HERSCH	He’s had a stroke! He can’t feel a thing on that side of his body. 

DUBOIS	Try the other side.

BORZ	That’s better.

MR. HERSCH	Dubois.

DUBOIS	Welcome back, Herr Dreschler. Remember Koko? Where are my paintings?

MR. HERSCH	In the wall.

DUBOIS	En francais!

MR. HERSCH 	In the wall.

DUBOIS	I knew you’d never let them far from your sight. Trust was never part of your vocabulary. Which wall? Point to it.

MR. HERSCH	I... I don’t remember.

BORZ	Gentlemen. Please join us.

BORZ	What’s this bring to mind?

DUBOIS	Wagner. “Ride of the Valkyries”.

BORZ	Wrong. Duvall. APOCALYPSE NOW.

LILY	The sauce tastes really...

LILY	The mint sauce...

JON	It’s okay. We can make due without.

LILY	We can’t have Easter dinner without mint sauce. That was mommy’s favorite!

JON	Max! Are you stoned?

MAX	You get sloshed. I get stoned. What’s the big deal?

JON	One’s legal. One isn’t. Go to your room.

MAX	She spills mint sauce on me and I’m the one who’s sent to my room?! If mom was here--

JON	Mom is not here. I’m here. And you’re just going to have to get used to that.

MAX	Of course she’s not here! Thanks to you!

JON	Max, go to your room. Now!

MAX	Why couldn’t you have been the one that died.

JON	I’m sorry you had to witness that.  

ALI	I’ve seen worse.

ALI	You know what -- the Hersches are here. I can go borrow some mint sauce from them. 

LILY	But it won’t have pine nuts.

ALI	I bet I can find some of those too.

JON	Ali, can we speak for a moment?

JON	Sweetheart, why don’t you get a sponge and towel from the kitchen. I’ll help you clean up in a moment.

JON	I can’t tell you what it means to the kids for you to be here. 

ALI	They have a heckuva way of showing it.

JON	You should see them on a bad day.

JON	I’m sorry, Ali. I mean I feel blessed with my kids and the time I had with Kate but...

JON	...your sister was not the easiest person. 

ALI	You married her.

JON	You’re right. The truth is... Max caught us by surprise. It was the right thing to do. Or so I thought.

JON	We went through a rough patch. I turned to you. I was wrong to do so. But you don’t know what you meant to me.

ALI	Please...

JON	No. I’ve thought about this for years. Hear me out. Please.

JON	You saw me as the man I wanted to be. You made me feel... You made me feel. Then I wake up one morning and you’re gone. What am I supposed to think? 

ALI	I went off to serve my country.

JON	Come on. That’s a rationalization if I ever heard one.

ALI	Always the intellect. 

JON	You disappeared. How do you think your sister felt? We were both lost. Ironically, that’s what brought us back together.

ALI	I think you just wanted a warm body.

JON	What’s that supposed to mean?

ALI	You were in pain. I get it. But I wasn’t going to be the one to break up my sister’s marriage... How do you think I felt? 

JON	So you sign up as a lifer in the Marines? It’s almost a cliche.

ALI	When you’re 20 life is a cliche... What do you want from me?

JON	Ali - I never meant to hurt you...

ALI	Truth is... I don’t really care. 

JON	But I do.

ALI 	I’ve gotta get Lily’s mint sauce.

PEE-WEE	Empty.

BORZ	Tell us where they are!

MR. HERSCH	I don’t... I thought... 

MRS. HERSCH	We have no idea what you’re looking for! Please! We’ve been in this apartment for seven years and if there was something here, I would know about it!

DUBOIS	You’ve been living here for seven years?!  My records indicate you’ve lived at The Carrington for close to thirty.

MRS. HERSCH	We used to live upstairs. After Bernhard had his stroke, we wanted something on the ground level so we moved down here. Dubois smiles.

DUBOIS	There you have it. And which apartment did you used to live in?


MRS. HERSCH	10C.

DUBOIS	Thank you Mrs. Hersch for your cooperation.

BORZ	10C is occupied.

DUBOIS	Occupied?!

BORZ	They delayed their move until Monday. It’s just a professor and two kids--

DUBOIS	You informed me the building would be empty except for the Hersches!

BORZ	They’re ten floors up. I didn’t think --

DUBOIS	That’s right.

DUBOIS	You... didn’t... think. 

DUBOIS	Do so now. Figure out what to do with them.

MRS. HERSCH	Even that hoodlum sees you for the vain, base brute you are. 

ALI	 Mrs. Hersch? 

ALI	Borz?

BORZ	I’ll handle this. You go. 

BORZ	Hello?

ALI 	Borz! Call the police! The Hersches are dead! 

BORZ	Hello? 

ALI	Borz!

BORZ	Can’t hear you. Come to the lobby.

LILY	Ali!

JON	What the 

DUBOIS	Good evening. My name is Victor Dubois. Sorry for the unannounced arrival. Please have a seat. 

DUBOIS	I promise our visit will be as brief as humanly possible.

JON	Lily, come over here.

LILY	Who are they?

JON	It’s okay, sweetie. We do what they say and everything will be fine.

BORZ	What’s going on?

ALI	The Hersches are dead! Someone killed them. Call the cops. 

MARTINEZ	Try here.

JON	What are you doing!?

MARTINEZ	Shut up!

DUBOIS	No need to hide your phone. You will find there is no service.

DUBOIS	Quite the collection you have here.

DUBOIS	A fan of European history, are you?

JON	I teach it at Columbia.

DUBOIS	A professor? 

DUBOIS	Goya. One of Los Caprichos. Very good taste Mr. Stanton.

JON	You know your art. 

DUBOIS	I admire how an artist can dip his brush into his soul and capture his times in pictures

JON	It appears Goya captured our times as well. The picture’s called, “The sleep of Reason produces monsters.”

JON	Borz. What is this about?

BORZ	Pee-Wee, get over here.

PEE-WEE	What’s up, boss?

BORZ	There’s a girl trapped in the elevator on the 8th floor. Take care of her.

PEE-WEE	Sounds like fun.

DUBOIS	Everything okay?

BORZ	Super.

BORZ	Where’s the boy? 

JON	He’s with his Aunt for Easter. In the Hamptons.

DUBOIS	What is the boy’s name?

BORZ	Max.

DUBOIS	I find it interesting that you would set a place for him here at the table.

BORZ	Hammer, find him.

PEE-WEE	Come on out. Let’s play.

ALI	Who are you? What do you want?

PEE-WEE	Hey, girl. That was pretty wicked. I like “wicked”. What’s your sign?

PEE-WEE	I’m an Aries. 

PEE-WEE	You seem like a Pisces - mysterious but sexy. I think we could really get it on. I hope you’re not a Virgo. 

PEE-WEE	I once dated a Virgo... She had the worst taste in movies. That was a disaster.

ALI	I’m a Scorpio. It’d never work out.

ALI	What’s going on? Do you have a clue?

ALI	Max. I’m sorry you had to see that. But I need you to focus. Tell me what you know.

MAX	You killed him...  

ALI	All that matters now is if there’s more where he came from and how we can stop them.  

MAX	A bunch of guys with guns broke into our apartment. They got my dad and sister. 

ALI	How many guys?

MAX	Four... maybe five? Borz is with them. 

ALI	I gathered that.

MAX	And some French guy. I think he’s their leader... This is so twisted. 

ALI	Focus,  Max. You know your way around this place. I don’t. I need you. Your family needs you. 

ALI	What would these guys want in your apartment?

MAX	I have no idea. But they’re looking for SOMEthing. 

BORZ	Pee-Wee. Come in, Pee-Wee.

JON	Please tell me what you want. I’ll give you anything if you just leave us alone.

DUBOIS	I appreciate your kind offer, but in this instance I don’t believe you can be of assistance.

HAMMER	The kid’s not here.

BORZ	Pee-Wee!

DUBOIS	What is going on?

BORZ	Pee-Wee isn’t answering. Take Hammer and check it out.

DUBOIS	Perhaps it’s just a problem with Pee-Wee’s radio.

BORZ	As you taught me, it’s best to cover every scenario. Turn the elevators back on in the lobby so we can use them.

DUBOIS	And what scenario am I missing?

BORZ	There’s a doorman in the building. It’s just some girl - nothing to worry about. 

DUBOIS	Why am I only hearing about this now?

BORZ	I have it under control.

DUBOIS	We need those men in here. This was supposed to be a two hour operation. In and out.

BORZ	The construction workers don’t arrive until 8AM. We have time.

ALI	We’ve got to get out of the building and get help. Do you understand?

MAX	The elevators are jammed. 

ALI	I know. Talk to me about the stairs.

ALI	Hide.

HAMMER 	I’m telling ya this shit is messed up. Did you see Borz cutting that old man’s leg? He was enjoying that shit.

HAMMER	I don’t know if this job is worth it. How much you getting paid? 25?

HAMMER	 Borz? Come in.

BORZ	Yeah. 

HAMMER	We found Pee-Wee.

HAMMER	He’s dead. 

LEO	He’s wrapped up like a fucking Easter bunny!

BORZ	Faen! 

BORZ	You got to be fucking kidding me...

DUBOIS	This is how you have things under control?

BORZ	Find her and kill her.

MAX	This way!

ALI	I’m okay. 

ALI	Where now?

ALI	Max?

MAX	There’s a room behind one of these walls. Pat told me. He called it “a hidden sanctuary.”  At least, I think it was this apartment...

ALI	Max...

MAX	Hidden sanctuary...

ALI	Not the sanctuary I was expecting...

Ali	You know Morse. 

MAX	Like Lily said. I was a scout. Once.

ALI	What is this place?

MAX	A speakeasy during prohibition. The residents would meet here in secret to get wasted. 

ALI	Not on my watch.

MAX	You’re not my mom.

ALI	Exactly. I’m your worst nightmare. I need you present. All of you. Help me out with this. Just hold it here.

HAMMER	We lost them.

BORZ	What do you mean lost them? Who’s them?

HAMMER	She’s got the Stanton kid with her. And she’s armed.

BORZ	Keep looking.

DUBOIS	How’d she get into the building? The doors were locked.

BORZ	I let her in. She was having dinner with the Stantons here. I figured...

DUBOIS 	...that she was on the 10th floor. I know. You idiot. So she was having dinner here? What light can you shed on our mysterious young lady?

JON	Nothing. I just met her.

DUBOIS	You invited a stranger to share Easter dinner? She must be very beautiful.

JON	She helped my children save Jasper our cat. She was new here. It was the least we could do.

DUBOIS	Who is this doorwoman?

BORZ	She’s new.

DUBOIS	You happen to know her name?

BORZ	Ali... Something Polish... Ali Gorski.

DUBOIS	She’s popular. “Gunnery Sergeant Alexandra Gorski of the Marine Security Guard Brigade received the Silver Star for her actions on October 15, 2019 during a terrorist ambush on the Ambassador’s convoy in Bucharest, Romania. Gorski is only the third female soldier to receive the award for exceptional valor since WWII.” 

BORZ	The doorman?

DUBOIS	What’s a decorated soldier doing here as a doorman? 

MAX	Why didn’t you talk to my mom?

ALI	Life happens.

MAX	What about my dad? You guys’ve clearly known each other for a while.

ALI	Last time I saw him he acted like an ass. 

MAX	He still does.

ALI	Hey! 

ALI	I can call your father an ass. You can’t.

MAX	You didn’t speak to my folks all these years because they did something you didn’t like?

ALI	Pretty much. But I was young and stupid... Sound familiar?

ALI	Your dad and I had a thing once.

MAX	No way!

ALI	Way. But like I said, I was young and stupid.

MAX	You fuckin’ gotta be kiddin’ me.

ALI	Max! But your mom was the better match. Your dad evidently agreed. 

MAX	My dad’s a pussy. 

ALI	He’s not a pussy.

MAX	You don’t know anything about him. How could you. You haven’t been around. He’s a fucking coward.

ALI	A dad raising two kids on his own doesn’t sound like a coward to me.

MAX	My mom and dad were driving back from the theater... I was on the phone with my mom when the car slid off the road into the lake. Mom was caught inside. Dad made it out, she didn’t. 

ALI	I’m sure he tried--

MAX	I was on the phone with her for a full minute as the car filled with water. What was he doing all that time? He should have done more.

ALI	Don’t you think if he could have done anything to save her he would have?

MAX	He didn’t try hard enough!

ALI	It’s nothing to be ashamed of. I’ve seen a lot of tough guys cry. 

MAX	I’m not my father.

ALI	Max, what the hell...

LEO	Did you see that?

ALI	Are you out of your fucking mind? Those guys want to kill us AND your family. 

ALI	I don’t care what you think of your dad. Think about your sister. 

ALI	I’m going to get help. Either you work with me and do exactly what I tell you or I go off and do it on my own. Understand? 

MAX	Check this out?

ALI	A dumbwaiter?

MAX	That’s how they got the liquor up here without anyone noticing.

MAX	It’s our way outta here. Let’s go.

MAX	What?

ALI	I’m not good in tight spaces.

MAX	Do you have a better idea?

ALI	Get in.

MARTINEZ	There’s six more rooms. If we have to tear down every wall we’ll be here til Christmas. 

BORZ	What now, M. Dubois?

DUBOIS	You’re the one who “thought through every detail”. But we’ve already seen thinking is an unfair burden to impose on you.

BORZ	The boy here knows every corner of this building. The handyman used to give him blue prints of the place.

JON	That was years ago.

BORZ	Where are they?

LILY	Max had a secret hiding place in his room.

BORZ	Where?

LILY	He never told me. It’s a secret.

DUBOIS	It’s here. It has to be...

DUBOIS	You have amassed quite a library over the years.

JON	The books I’ve collected have been an important part of my work.

DUBOIS	With a distinct bent toward British history.

JON 	You can take the boy out of England but you can’t take England out of the boy.

DUBOIS	You must have spent a small fortune to build shelves capable of storing your collection.

JON	The former tenants built the library. That was the main reason we bought this place.

JON	What the hell...

DUBOIS	I never knew Dreschler to be a big reader.

JON	Dreschler?

DUBOIS	Your Mr. Hersch.

DUBOIS	There.

DUBOIS	Borz! 

JON	I had no idea...

DUBOIS	Get the tools.

MARTINEZ	Customized Mosler from the early 80’s. Four rotary combination locks... This isn’t going to be easy. 

DUBOIS	How long?

MARTINEZ	A good safe cracker could get you inside in five hours. I’ll do it in two.

MAX	Ali.

ALI	Don’t worry.

MAX	Are you all right?

HAMMER	D’you hear that? Where’s that coming from?

LEO	Over there.

MAX	Maybe this wasn’t a good idea.

ALI	Yes it was. Hold on!

LEO	They’re in here.

JON	I opened a ‘92 vintage bottle of wine for the holiday. Would you like a glass? 

BORZ	Shut up Stanton.

DUBOIS	That would be splendid.

ALI	Wait here.

MAX	What is it? 

ALI	It’s not like your video games, is it?

ALI	Turn around.

ALI	Turn!

DUBOIS	A Bordeaux.

JON	Impressive. It was a gift. I’m not much of a connoisseur myself. Would you like some? 

BORZ	Sit down and shut up.

JON	I take that as a “no”.

JON	Hold this for a minute.

JON	Do you mind if I ask how long ago you met Mr. Hersch?

DUBOIS	Why do you ask?

JON	Habit. Probably too many years in research libraries. My wife used to say I asked too many questions. 

DUBOIS	Over thirty years.

BORZ	I don’t think you should...

JON	A Frenchman and a German. Interesting.	

DUBOIS	Why?	

JON	Historically speaking they haven’t always gotten along?

DUBOIS	We had common business interests.

JON	And where did you meet Borz? He doesn’t strike me as someone who’d  move in your circles. Let me guess. Prison.

DUBOIS	You have done a splendid job of deduction, Mr. Stanton. Borz and I did meet in prison. 

MAX	They locked us in? That’s illegal.

MAX	My bad. Too much weed.

MAX	The phone is dead.

ALI	You know where the main panel is? 

MAX	Control room. This way.

ALI	Forget about getting the phones to work. 

MAX	What about the fire alarm?

ALI	Good thinking, Max.

MARTINEZ	Give me a hand.

JON	May I ask what you’re looking for? Perhaps I can help.

DUBOIS	Your wife is right. You ask too many questions. Where is she by the way?

JON	Dead.

DUBOIS	Desole. What have you learned is my passion?

JON	Art.

DUBOIS	And how long ago did I meet your Mr. Hersch?

JONO	ver thirty years.

DUBOIS	Right. In East Germany to be precise. And you, the learned scholar, can you tell me what were the most prominent events there at that time?

JON	The last days of the German Democratic Republic. The fall of East Berlin. The wall coming down. 

DUBOIS	Bravo! Our Mr. Hersch - Dreschler was in charge of the Koko program, requisitioning the most valuable assets of his East German citizens.  

JON	And you were brought in to fence them.

DUBOIS	I was there to help. We had to turn the art into hard currency.

JON	To finance a bankrupt government. 

DUBOIS	I was saving those works so the rest of the world could enjoy them. If it weren’t for my efforts they could have been lost forever behind an iron curtain.

JON	You delude yourself.

DUBOIS	I came to take what is mine, professor. I paid for it with the best years of my life--

BORZ	Hey! What are you doing?!

BORZ	What should we do?

DUBOIS	Delete it.

JON	Let her

BORZ	What?!

DUBOIS	DUBOIS Delete it!

JON	Don’t touch my child.

BORZ	You talk too much.

DUBOIS	What is that?

BORZ	Fire alarm.

DUBOIS	I know it’s the fire alarm, you idiot! I specifically instructed you to disable it.

BORZ	I’ll handle it.

JON	Lily...

JON	Lily, listen to me. I want you to shut your eyes, okay?

JON	What’s your favorite place in the world?

LILY	I don’t know.

JON	Of course you do. Close your eyes. What about Central Park at Christmas? Imagine you’re there. What do you see?

LILY	Horse and buggies in the snow. And Christmas lights. 

JON	That’s right. And what do you smell?

LILY	Warm chestnuts. Hotdogs.

JON	Good. Now I want you to keep on thinking about your favorite places, okay? Because when this is all over, I’m going to take you to all of them, okay?

MAX	Ali...

BORZ	Guns on the floor. Slow.

BORZ	One word and I shoot you. Understand?

FIRE CHIEF	Open up!

BORZ	I’m so sorry. False alarm.

FIRE CHIEF	False alarm?

BORZ	Yeah. All’s good. One of the contractors must’ve crossed wires or something.

FIRE CHIEF	Why were the doors locked? That’s illegal. 

BORZ	There’s no one else in the building cause of the remodel except for a couple construction guys. The building’s closed to the public. We’re using the service doors. 

OFFICER OLSEN	What’d I miss?

FIRE CHIEF	You sure everything is fine?

BORZ	Of course. No smoke, no fire. You see. False alarm.

FIRE CHIEF	ity regulations say we gotta check it out anyway. Do a floor sweep.

BORZ	Ten floors, help yourself...

FIREMAN	Easter dinner’s getting cold at the station.

FIRE CHIEF	Regulations are regulations.

OFFICER OLSEN	C’mon Chief. Give your guys a break. We can bend the rules a little. Clearly nothin’s wrong here.

FIRE CHIEF	Alright. Just make sure the contractors don’t mess with the fire alarm system. 

OFFICER OLSEN	Another false alarm and you’ll get fined.

BORZ	Of course, Chief. Sorry about that.

OFFICER OLSEN	Party’s over.

BORZ	Nice try, Ali.

BORZ	You’ve aroused my curiosity. Why would a decorated officer hole up here as a doorman?

ALI	To meet interesting people - like you.

BORZ	I had a friend that came home damaged after the war. Are you damaged Sergeant?

ALI	Not as much as you.

BORZ	Get them!

HAMMER	I can’t see!

ALI	No matter what happens, run and find a way out. Got it?

ALI	For protection. You’re man enough to handle it.

LEO	There!

BORZ	Go!

BORZ	Fucking fitte...

BORZ	Find the boy. I’m gonna kill that kuja.

MAX	Shit.

MAX	Come on!

DUBOIS	What happened to the woman?

BORZ	On her way to hell.

DUBOIS	Let’s find a better way for her to die.

MAX Officer!

OFFICER OLSEN	What is it? You okay?

MAX	There are terrorists in The Carrington. You’ve got to call the police. SWAT. Everybody!

OFFICER OLSEN	Hold on, hold on. Terrorists? In The Carrington?

MAX	My dad. My sister - they’ve been kidnapped.

OFFICER OLSEN	Kidnapped?!

OFFICER OLSEN	This is 105-Charlie. I got a 10-10 here at 85 and Central Park West.

OFFICER OLSEN	There’s a kid here who claims The Carrington has been taken over by terrorists.

OFFICER OLSEN	What’s your name?

MAX	 Max Stanton.

OFFICER OLSEN	 Max Stanton. They want to speak with you. 

MAX	Hello?

BORZ	Hello, Max. We miss you up here.

OFFICER OLSEN	Let’s go, kid.

MAX	Stay back.

OFFICER OLSEN	Alright. Easy.

OFFICER OLSEN	How ‘bout you give me that gun, kid?

MAX	I’ll shoot you, cocksucker.

OFFICER OLSEN	You going to spray my brains all over the concrete? Is that the idea? 

OFFICER OLSEN	Move it.

DUBOIS	Ms. Gorski? 

DUBOIS	Ms. Gorski, can you hear me?

ALI	Whoever you are and whatever you’re  up to, you should walk away. Now. Someone’s bringing the police to take you down. If they don’t I will.

DUBOIS	Things don’t always work out as we might wish. You, of all people should understand that, Sergeant Gorski.

DUBOIS 	Oh, by the way, I have someone here who wants to say hello.

MAX	Ali?

ALI	Max...	

MAX 	I’m sorry, Ali.

DUBOIS	The internet is a marvelous invention, n’est ce pas? 

DUBOIS	I was fascinated to read about what happened while you were in the service at the embassy. 

DUBOIS 	Unless you want more innocent blood on your hands, be here in fifteen minutes, unarmed and surrender. It’s over.


JON	You all right?

JON	Is Ali?

MAX	She’ll get us outta here, even if you can’t.

BORZ	Shut up.

DUBOIS	Why did you stop?

MARTINEZ	No water.

BORZ	What?!

BORZ	Try the bathroom.

LEO	No water in the bathroom either!

BORZ	It’s that bitch in the basement. 

DUBOIS	We have no time for this! Keep drilling.

MARTINEZ	Drill bit will break. We need the water to keep it cooled.

DUBOIS	Keep drilling! That’s an order!

DUBOIS	Where are you going? You created this mess. You fix it. 

MARTINEZ	I warned you.

DUBOIS	Merde!

DUBOIS	And turn on the water!

BORZ	Leo, what’s going on?...Take care of the water first. Do you copy?

ALI	You hurt my family. 

BORZ	Leo? What’s taking so long? 

MARTINEZ	We’re so close. I’m on the last lock.

BORZ	Leo!

ALI 	He’s dead. And you’re next.

DUBOIS	It seems your friend is more effective than you gave her credit.  

BORZ	I hear your put downs. I don’t hear your solutions.

DUBOIS	Try this one.

DUBOIS	From someone such as myself who appreciates fine art I can say your daughter has real talent. There is a stunning likeness in her drawing to this photo.

DUBOIS	If you just met Sergeant Gorski, why is there a photo of you together when you were younger?

DUBOIS	I noted your daughter’s signature and her reference to her “Aunt Ali”. I assume you are related to the war hero killing all my men. 

LILY	Aunt Ali is smarter and stronger than all of you. She saved Jasper. Dubois gets the confirmation he sought, smiles. Lily notes her father’s and brother’s concern.

LILY	Did I say something wrong?

DUBOIS	No. Quite to the contrary. You said something right. 

DUBOIS	It appears you have been withholding important information from us. I understand that kind of duplicity can get you discharged from the military. Isn’t that true, “Aunt Ali”.

ALI	It’s Gunnery Sergeant Gorski.  I want you to let them go or I will...

DUBOIS	What you will do is turn the water back on then deliver your weapons to Borz or we will kill your family.

ALI	That won’t be possible.

ALI	What’d you do?!!

DUBOIS 	For every ten minutes that pass without water a member of your family will lose a limb. Now TURN ON THE WATER. 

DUBOIS	Bring me the boy.

ALI	Listen. The main water valve has been destroyed, but I have a plan.

DUBOIS	Welcome, Sergeant. I am Victor Dubois. I accept your total surrender.

ALI	Now let them go.

DUBOIS	I believe there remains an  outstanding matter - the water. 

ALI	Here’s the deal. Once I get your water I’ll radio you to confirm you’ve let my family go. If you don’t, I’ll take you to hell.

DUBOIS	I’m impressed someone in your position negotiates from an illusion of strength.

DUBOIS	I believe we have already established our terms. Now, the water. 

MARTINEZ	Almost there...Dubois’ radio crackles to life. 

ALI	I kept my end of the bargain. Your turn.

DUBOIS	Be careful with them!

JON	Is that what you were after?

DUBOIS	Nothing is as it appears, Mr. Stanton.

JON	It’s a Caravaggio. The Adoration of the Shepherds...

JON	Do you have any idea how much those paintings are worth?

BORZ	How much?

DUBOIS	Borz! Time is of the essence.

JON	60 to 80 million.

BORZ	All these paintings are worth 80 million?

JON	No. Each one.

JON	Let us go. You made a deal.

DUBOIS	Deals are made to be broken.

BORZ	You said they were worth five max

DUBOIS	We have an agreement. Set fee for services rendered. End of discussion.

BORZ	I don’t think so.

DUBOIS	We don’t have time for this. 

BORZ	You’re right...	Shoot the old man.

DUBOIS	Do either of you have any idea how to move fine art? Shoot him. I’ll triple your end.

DUBOIS	Decide. NOW. Twenty-five percent for the two of us, fifty for you. Or we can all go down together.

DUBOIS	Is a bit more money really worth your life?

BORZ	You tell me.

DUBOIS	You’re really coming into your own, you know that?

BORZ	I had a good teacher.

DUBOIS	Okay! Deal.

BORZ	Guess now it’s fifty fifty.

DUBOIS	Shall we?!

JON MAX!

BORZ	This... is the difference between you and me.

JON	You’re not taking my son. 

MAX	Dad!

BORZ 	You should’ve taken the day off

LILY	Daddy, daddy!

ALI	I underestimated you...

JON	And I you.

ALI	Your daddy will be all right. But you need to be his water wings now. Understand? Just press it here, okay?

ALI	You okay? Help Lily with your dad. Okay?

MAX	Get ‘em.

MAX	I’m fine. Get them!

ALI	Call an ambulance.

BORZ	Oh my God! Don’t shoot! I’m the doorman!

BORZ	A woman went crazy. She took a family upstairs hostage... She’s got a gun!

POLICE 	Alpha team, spread out! Seal the street! Building’s surrounded. Plan B.

POLICE OFFICER	Drop your weapon! 

ALI	My brother-in-law’s wounded on the 10th floor. He needs a medic.

POLICE OFFICER	Drop it NOW!

ALI	It’s not-- It’s not me. It’s Borz! The doorman. They have a kid with them-- 

POLICE	Drop it now or we’ll shoot!

DUBOIS	It is gratifying to see how much you’ve grown, Borz. I’ve always said art is what brings out man’s higher nature.

DUBOIS	Merde.

BORZ	Not always.

DUBOIS	You were always a slow learner.

ALI	BORZ!!	whirls around, sees... Ali, standing on the other side of the tunnel.

BORZ	You’re persistent, Sergeant. I’ll give you that.

ALI	We gotta kiss up enough around here. We don’t have to do it with each other...

BORZ	Let’s finish this.

BORZ	Are you insane?!

BORZ	FEAN

BORZ	I knew you were sick... I didn’t know how bad...

ALI	You should’ve taken the day off...

MAX	I didn’t think I’d see you. 

ALI	You didn’t think you’d get rid of me that easily, did you? 

ALI	How is he?

MAX	He’s all right. I’m sorry Ali. This is my fault. I couldn’t do it.

ALI	Do what?

MAX	Use the gun. I wasn’t the man you wanted me to be.

ALI	I like the man you are. 

ALI	I brought you something.

LILY MINT	sauce.

ALI	With pine nuts.

JON	What about the lamb?

ALI	I knew I forgot something.

ALI	How you feeling?

JON	I’ll manage. In a couple of weeks I’ll be back to my normal boring self.

ALI	I’m sure it’ll be good to get home?

DRIVER	Sir. We should go.

JON	What are you going to do?

ALI	I won’t be working as a doorman.

JON	We’ll be back after they finish the renovations. Maybe you could join us for dinner then afterall if you’re interested. I know they’d love it if you did.

ALI	And you?

JON	C’mon sport. We should go.

MAX	I’m one of those tough guys who can cry.

ALI	Yes you are.
