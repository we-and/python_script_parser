THOMAS	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS 	…I made some really good friends…


THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER	Shane and Yong Bao had a very long way to go to get back to their homes. They travelled across India together and soon they were in the Himalayan mountains.

STORYTELLER	The weather got colder and colder. Then, it started to snow.

STORYTELLER	'What's all this cold stuff falling from the sky?' 'It's just snow,' said Yong Bao. 'Sometimes this happens when it gets very cold!' 'Bonza!' 'I like it!' 'It does look very pretty, but you have to be very careful in the snow, it can make the tracks very slippery!'

STORYTELLER	Yong Bao was right, the snow did make the tracks very slippery. But Shane liked it... 'I reckon all this slippy stuff makes riding the rails just like surfing,' said Shane as he slid around a corner. 

STORYTELLER	'Maybe it does!' 'But engines don't surf!' 'You're right there, Mate, But I've always wanted to give it a go!'

STORYTELLER	'Cowabunga!' 'Woo hoo!' He laughed as he whizzed around the next. 'Slow down! Remember the snow can be dangerous as well as fun!'

STORYTELLER	Then Shane reached the top of a very tall hill. 'This is going to be the best surf yet!' 

STORYTELLER	'No Shane! This is too tall and too steep!' But it was too late...

STORYTELLER	'Wahay! Look at me! I'm surfing!'

STORYTELLER	Shane went faster and faster. He went so fast he started to get a little scared. But when he put his brakes on...

STORYTELLER	He just kept going... 'Heeellllppp!' 

STORYTELLER	Yong Bao puffed bravely down the hill trying to rescue his friend. Then there was trouble...

STORYTELLER	Shane crashed straight into a snowdrift. 'Awwww... Wipeout...' 

STORYTELLER	Then Yong Bao helped Shane out of the snowdrift...Shane pulls up next to Yong Bao. Shane has a frosting of snow on him.

STORYTELLER	'Thanks mate! You were right, snow can be dangerous as well as fun!' 'Don't worry, I'll teach you to puff safely through the snow!'

STORYTELLER	'The first lesson is go slow and steady,' So Yong Bao lead the way through the mountains, teaching Shane all about puffing through the snow.

THOMAS	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
