MICHAEL	Heb je het koud?

ALISON	Het gaat wel.

SYLVIA	Ik moet plassen. Stopt ge?

ALISON	Ik vind het echt kei lief dat je mee bent gekomen.

MICHAEL	Alles voor u, hè. Wel echt alleen maar voor u.

ALISON	Ga je mij subiet nog graag zien? Ik bedoel zonder...

MICHAEL	Zonder die twee? Ja, tuurlijk.

ALISON	Echt?

MICHAEL	Maar zeker, poepie. Gij zijt toch veel meer dan die twee tetten alleen.

ALISON	En gij zijt meer dan uw buikske alleen.

MICHAEL	Zeg. Zal het gaan?

SYLVIA	Allez, we zijn weg.

ALISON	Suikerdipje?

MICHAEL	Ja. Ah. Keigoed. Dank u.

ALISON	Wat was da?

MICHAEL	Kweenie. Heb ik iets geraakt?

ALISON	Wat is da? Oh nee.

SYLVIA	Oh my god.

OLD BEARDED MAN	Pssjt!

ALISON	(sighs)

BEARDED YOUNG MAN	(speaks East-European)

ALISON	Ik ga content zijn als 't gedaan is met die dwaze blikken.

SYLVIA	Gij zou moeten content zijn met wat de natuur u gegeven heeft, Alison.

ALISON	Da moet gij just zeggen.

SYLVIA	Ja da moet kik just zeggen. En frons ni zo want ge krijgt daar rimpels van.

MICHAEL	Probeer eens.

SYLVIA	Ge weet ze echt wel te kiezen he.

MICHAEL	Het zag er op de website wel properder uit.

ALISON	't Is misschien daarom dathet zo goedkoop is he.

JANJA	Welcome at Klinika Krawczyk.

SYLVIA	Hi, I am Sylvia.

JANJA	Yes, of course, Sylvia. So nice to meet you. Please... Daniel, I would like you to show rooms to everyone for liposculpture. Come with me, darling.

JANJA	Doctor Krawczyk is very brilliant surgeon. He is developing a brand new rejuvenation treatment, based on experimental skin cell technology. This lady just had chemical peeling to make skin look young again.

SYLVIA	I saw the result on the website. Amazing!

OKSANA	I am sorry for staring, but you have beautiful body.

ALISON	Thank you.

OKSANA	Did doctor Krawczyk do them?

ALISON	No, no, they're mine.

MICHAEL	They seem a bit young for plastic surgery.

JANJA	Teen pregnancies. We give them free abortion.

ALISON	Oh, that's really nice. He poepie?

ALISON	Oh, that's really nice.

JANJA	So, you will only have grin lift?

SYLVIA	No, I have also tummy-tuck, anal bleaching, Brazilian lift and eyelids.

ALISON	Poepie? Poepie, ça va?

JANJA	Is he alright? He looks like he seen ghost.

SYLVIA	He was supposed to become a doctor.

SYLVIA	He dropped out of medical school because he's afraid of blood.

JANJA	Afraid of blood? Seriously?

ALISON	It's a condition. A lot of people have it. It's called hemophobia.

JANJA	Oh.

DR K	Is your song, no?

WILLIAM	It's been a while.

DR K	You're recovering well. Very good. So... You are scheduled for next treatment liposuction on... Alfred Schultz? You are William Maier, no?

WILLIAM	Yes, it's a privacy thing, okay?

DR K	So, nobody to know you are here? I understand. Not good for image of a famous person, huh? Don't worry. Nobody will ever know you are here, mister Schultz.

OKSANA	There's nothing wrong with being gay. Some of my best friends are gay.

MICHAEL	No, hemophobia, not homophobia.

JANJA	Doctor, I like you to meet lovely new guests.

SYLVIA	It's an honour to meet you, doctor Krawczyk.

DR K	Beautiful ladies! I will make you even more beautiful!

JANJA	Yes, yes. This is miss Oksana. She's here for tattoo removal.

DR K	May I?

DR K	I would suggest G cup.

ALISON	No, no, I want them smallerhè, not bigger.

DR K	Ah yes, of course.

ALISON	I thought a B?

SYLVIA	Ge weet wat ik daar van denk he, Ally. Ge zijt zot..

ALISON	B is a good size, no? Toch?

MICHAEL	Ja tuurlijk, ik zie u graag gelijk da ge zijt, poepie.

DR K	If you want, we can do it.

ALISON	Yes, I want a B. Definitely a B.

DR K	Okay, a B. No problem, B.

ALISON	Ik ben gestopt, alweer.

MICHAE	Nerveus?

ALISON	B is toch een goe formaat, ni?

MICHAEL	Zeker. Absoluut.

MICHAEL	But I think that G cup is better, no? And I make you even more beautiful.

ALISON	Of B en een half. Zou dat ook kunnen?

MICHAEL	Euhm...

ALISON	(sighs)

MICHAEL	Alison... Ik zou graag...

ALISON	Afscheid nemen van de tweeling?

MICHAEL	Euhm... ja.

DANIEL	Cigarette?

MICHAEL	No, thank you.

DANIEL	That's a smart boy. Are you having surgery today?

MICHAEL	Me? No, no.

DANIEL	I thought... sorry.

ALISON	No, we're here for me.

DANIEL	For you?

ALISON	Yeah, I'm having a breast reduction.

DANIEL	Really? Pity. You've got a body to die for. Why mess with God's work?

ALISON	Everybody says that, but... I mean I have back problems, I can't run for the bus...

DANIEL	If you were my girlfriend, I'd buy you a car.

MICHAEL	We have a car.

DANIEL	Oh yeah, I've seen it. Old timer, right?

ALISON	So, you work in the hospital?

MICHAEL	Does it have a good reputation?

DANIEL	He's more nervous than you are.

MICHAEL	No, it's just that I mean...

DANIEL	It's good men can't have babies. Humanity would go extinct.

ALISON	Yes, that's true.

ALISON	Da is om te lachen, hè poepie.

DANIEL	Poepie?

NURSE	This is for disinfection incision area.

SYLVIA	Yes I know, honey.

NURSE 2	Alison Jacobs?

MICHAEL	Yes.

NURSE 2	We will call you in one minute.

MICHAEL	Excuse me, don't you have to check her blood type?

NURSE 2	That's not my job, sir.

MICHAEL	Doctor, do you know her blood type at all?

NURSE 3	Mister, please, you wait outside, yes?

MICHAEL	Isn't it prohibited to drink coffee in an OR?

NURSE 3	Doctor Leniç he knows what he's doing, he's a real professional.

MICHAEL	According to EU regulations, it's really not...

ALISON	Sit down please.

MICHAEL	Poepie, zij nu 's rustig.

ALISON	Ja, maar allez...

JANJA	Can I get you something?

MICHAEL	I'm fine. Can't she just answera simple question...

NURSE 3	But you have too many questions, yes? All information on website.

MICHAEL	I have checked the website but it said nothing about what type of anaesthesia or what happens to glandular tissues...

NURSE 3	Are you a doctor?

MICHAEL	No, but I've studied... ...to be one, okay?

ALISON	For a year.

MICHAEL	Is da nu zo belangrijk?

ALISON	Da is toch zo?

DANIEL	I can give you a tour of the building, it's better than waiting and getting nervous.

JANJA	That's a good idea. It's important that your girlfriend is relaxed before surgery.

ALISON	't Is goe, echt waar. Ga maar mee, anders zit ge hier toch maar te stressen.

MICHAEL	Zeker?

ALISON	Ja.

DANIEL	Come.

DANIEL	Did you know that in China they already performed plastic surgery 2,000 years...

MICHAEL	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I went to med school.

DANIEL	Oh yeah, for five minutes, no? But don't worry, here the doctors did finish their studies.

DANIEL	Travel agent. I've been working in this country for a year now, but...You know the best part of my job? The girls. After the treatment they are  always, you know...(scoffs) Ecstatic. They feel all yummy and sexy and they want affirmation.

DANIEL 	That's where I come in. Easy pussy.

ALISON	(sighs)

DANIEL	(cont'd) You know those abortions they do here? They use the fetuses for stem cell treatment.

MICHAEL	This experimental stem cell stuff... None of that has been proven to work, has it?

DANIEL	Come on, man. It's all about money. Come.

ALISON	Excuse me? I thought doctor Krawczyk was doing the operation.

NURSE 3	No problem at all.

ALISON	You know, I want a B cup, hè?

YONAH	(hums afirmatively) Mhm.

ALISON	Okay.

MICHAEL	Are we allowed to be here?

DANIEL	(sighs)

MICHAEL	I promised Alison I would be there when she wakes up, so...

ALISON	What? You almost killed 
my...

YONAH	You really think there is treatment for this?

DR. K	Okay, okay.

YONAH	Here.

DR. K	Yonah, let's try complera. But use a saline.

YONAH	Complera intravenously?

DR. K	We have no time to play safe. We need intravenous injection.

DR. K	Yonah, please make a new protein base, this one is off.

YONAH	It's no use.

MICHAEL	I'll do it.

DR. K	Have to save woman and everyone else.

YONAH	She is lost.

DR. K	Yonah, I am your boss. You are in my country, you work in my hospital. Listen to me!

YONAH	First, I want explanation. Is virus created in special youth treatment programme? You were secretly treating people here. They did not know?

DR. K	Okay, okay. Patient Zero, she was also in programme, but she was contained. I don't know how she could get out. Somehow, I just wanted to make people happy. That's why we did this enzyme experiment, to stop ageing. To make the world look more beautiful.

JANJA	Better he dies like man, not like animal.

YONAH	What have you done?

JANJA	He was infected, and much stronger than woman.We could not longer take any risks or we would all die.

ALISON	But he was the only one who could find a cure.

MICHAEL	Maybe we can, Yonah. What if we mix the complera with the rilpivirine?

ALISON	Mama. Mama.

YONAH	Get me diarylprimidine.

MICHAEL	Okay.

YONAH	The syringe.

MICHAEL	Yeah. Here.

YONAH	Hold head.

MICHAEL	Okay.

YONAH	Rak bitanga Titsjka, quick, I need amputation before virus spreads. Chop it off!

DANIEL	Ready?

YONAH	Do it! Son of bitch.

DANIEL	Oh shit.

YONAH	Be quick! Hurry! Please.

JANJA	Take it easy.

YONAH	No time, virus will reach my brain.

YONAH	That's how you do it. Haha. Oh god. Please. Stop it. Turn it off. Fuck. Oh God.

ALISON	O nee!

DANIEL	She's getting loose.

JANJA	Please, put this woman out of misery.

YONAH	Michael... kill her now!

JANJA	Do it.

DANIEL	What are you waiting for?

YONAH	Michael, kill her now!

MICHAEL	Okay.

JANJA	Do it!

DANIEL	Come on, do it!

MICHAEL	Oh shit.

JANJA	Oh, pitchka.

JANJA	Do you mind?

DANIEL	Oh yeah...You completely forgot I understand a bit of your monkey language.I heard what doctor Crapshit said just before you killed him. I know that the anonymous patients' programme was your idea. You are responsible for this shit.

JANJA	So... Is this what you want?

DANIEL	I prefer my pussy a bit younger.
