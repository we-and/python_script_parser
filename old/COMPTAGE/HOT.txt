(HOT CHOCOLATE HOLIDAY)





NIKKI	Two hot chocolates and a scone sandwich. You got it.

COLETTE	Fresh scones.

NIKKI	Great timing.

COLETTE	Hi Mallory!

MALLORY	Hi Colette.

NIKKI	Hot chocolate and a scone?

MALLORY	Perfect. Extra whipped cream on top, please.

COLETTE	Of course. Here you go.

MALLORY	You're the best.

COLETTE	See you tomorrow! Uh, thanks, Mom. I'll take over.

SANDRA	What'd I do wrong?

COLETTE	Nothing.

SANDRA	So particular.

COLETTE	It has to be done—

SANDRA	Just right. Colette, just use the liquid vanilla stuff.

COLETTE	That's not how Grandma Thea did it.

SANDRA	"Always fresh." (edge of bitterness) So hard to please.

COLETTE	She appreciated fresh ingredients.

SANDRA	I don't see you milking a cow for that hot chocolate.

COLETTE	(ignoring her teasing) Don't forget to pack up the whipped cream, Mom.

SANDRA	I'm waiting till we're ready to leave.

COLETTE	Just a few more minutes.

SANDRA	Are you still planning on selling this recipe to grocery stores?

COLETTE	Not selling the recipe, but the drink; Frank Banner and his company think it could go national.

SANDRA	How will it be fresh when it's being trucked across the country?

COLETTE	Dry mix. I'm working on it. You don't think Grandma Thea would mind, do you?
 
SANDRA	She'd be fine with whatever you decide.

COLETTE	Test it.

SANDRA	Mmmmm.

COLETTE	Just like Grandma's?

SANDRA	Just.

COLETTE	Good.

NIKKI	You better get going. The Christmas Kickoff starts at 6.

COLETTE	Yes. You're okay here?

NIKKI	It's all under control. Have fun!

COLETTE	Thanks! Whipped cream.

SANDRA	Oh, right.
 
COLETTE	Happy holidays! Enjoy the hot chocolate.

SANDRA	I can run things here, you know. You should go take a look at the booths. Buy something.

COLETTE	I don't need anything.

SANDRA	You sure? Not even one of those cute ornaments over there?

COLETTE	Nope. (beat) Do you need one of those?

SANDRA	Hmmm. I need a tree first. I haven't been able to get one yet this year.

COLETTE	I can go with you to pick one up.

SANDRA	How about tomorrow?
 
COLETTE	Can we make it during the week instead? 
 
SANDRA	That's fine.
 

COLETTE	Can I get something ready for you?

MARCUS	Oh. Sure. Ah, just a coffee, please.

COLETTE	You bet.

MARCUS	(thinking aloud) Colette's Coffee... do you have that cafe over on Holly street?

COLETTE	Yeah, that's mine.

MARCUS	Oh! Oh great. I'm opening right next door. I'm Marcus, by the way.

COLETTE	The one that's been under construction?

MARCUS	(nods) We open Monday.

COLETTE	That's great. What type of business?
 
MARCUS	Dessert shop.

COLETTE	Oh, yum. Well, it'll be good to have a new neighbor.

MARCUS	Thanks. I'm excited to finally get it all up and running.

COLETTE	Here's that coffee. On the house.

MARCUS	Really? Are you sure?

COLETTE	Of course. For my new neighbor.

MARCUS	Thank you. Well, Merry Christmas.

COLETTE	Merry Christmas.

SANDRA	(teasing) Merry Christmas indeed.

COLETTE	Mom, that's for customers.

SANDRA	I'm free labor here.
 
COLETTE	You're drinking more than you're selling.

SANDRA	All right then. Why don't you let me man the booth, and you go skeedaddle?

COLETTE	But---

SANDRA	Nope. Take a break. Go check out that ornament or something.

COLETTE	Before you give it to customers, add a sprinkle of the cocoa—

SANDRA	Honey, I watched my mother make this stuff more than you did. Now go.

COLETTE	Thanks, Merry Christmas.

MARCUS 	A gift or is that for you?

COLETTE	Oh! A gift. (gesturing towards her booth) My mother was hinting that she wanted one.

MARCUS	Nice choice. Are you waiting for the hay ride?

COLETTE	Oh, no.

MARCUS	Well, come on. My treat as a thanks for the coffee.

COLETTE	Oh, I don't know.

MARCUS	Do horses make you nervous?

COLETTE	Hay makes me sneeze.

MARCUS	Really? Even the dried out stuff?

COLETTE	I... don't know, actually.

MARCUS	Want to risk it?

COLETTE	Sure. Why not.

MARCUS	So how long have you had your cafe?

COLETTE	The last few years--five years, I think?

MARCUS	Wow. Impressive. How'd you get started?
 
COLETTE	I'd sell to people on campus in college. I started out with a little shack, kind of like the booth back there, but that was it.

MARCUS	Quite the entrepreneur.

COLETTE	After the shack, I got a tiny shop that was more like a kiosk with a sink. But it grew and grew and here I am. How about you?

MARCUS	I actually was more of a cook. Pastry chef and what not. I came up through the ranks working at different bakeries and restaurants. But I wanted to have my own place and sell my creations.

COLETTE	So you did.

MARCUS	It's taken awhile. Lots of things to arrange and money to save, but I'm optimistic.

COLETTE	Why pastries?

MARCUS	I have a killer sweet tooth. No, well, I do, but ... I grew up appreciating homemade desserts. A buddy of mine and I joked a lot about going into business together. This was a perfect combination of dessert and business.
COLETTE	Well, congratulations.
 
MARCUS	Thanks.

COLETTE	Thank you. It was nice to get to know you.

MARCUS	Thanks for coming. And I look forward to being...

COLETTE	Neighbors?

MARCUS	Exactly.

COLETTE	See you around.

NIKKI	At it again?

COLETTE	I can't seem to get a dry version of the recipe to work.

NIKKI	Because it's never as good.

COLETTE	Not as good yet. I'll figure it out. Maybe a different creamer would work.

NIKKI	Frank Banner is here.

COLETTE	Send him on back.

FRANK BANNER	Hi there, Colette.

COLETTE	Hey Frank. I'm just fine-tuning the recipe.

FRANK BANNER	Good. Want me to test it?

COLETTE	Ah, not yet.

FRANK BANNER	I have news. Three national grocery chains are interested. I can line up promotions to go with it, demos, sampling. From there I think the product will speak for itself.

COLETTE	But it's not ready yet, and I'm still looking over the contract—

FRANK BANNER	I know, I know. Just want you to realize the interest level we already have.

COLETTE	Great.

MARCUS	Here you go. How many forks?

DESSERT CUSTOMER	Just one.

STEVEN	We'll have the hot chocolate and a peanut butter cookie.

JONATHAN	You got it.

MARCUS	Jonathan, it's on the house. This is Steven--

JONATHAN	The money guy?

MARCUS	My friend and business partner, and his wife Angie.

STEVEN	I was prepared to pay.

MARCUS	Kind of like the money going from one hand to the other.

ANGIE	Business looks good.

MARCUS	Thanks. There's not a line of customers out the door—

STEVEN	Yet.

MARCUS	--But we've had a steady stream of people coming and going.

JONATHAN	Here's your order.

ANGIE	Thanks.

STEVEN	Mmmm. I love this stuff.

ANGIE	Save some for me. Oh, Marcus, the chocolate marshmallow pie--I want one for Christmas dinner. Can I order one?

MARCUS	Yeah, I've actually had a few preorders today already. People are planning ahead.

STEVEN	Good.

ANGIE	Add me to the list.

STEVEN	We better run.

MARCUS	Have fun at work.
 
ANGIE	You too!

STEVEN	Keep that money coming in.

MARCUS	Hey Colette.

COLETTE	Marcus. How's the first day going?

MARCUS	Pretty well. What do you think?

COLETTE	I like it.

MARCUS	aWhat can I get you?

COLETTE	What's good?

MARCUS	Everything. Of course I'd say that.

COLETTE	What's your favorite then?
 
MARCUS	The Decadent Brownie. Oh, and the hot chocolate.

COLETTE	Really?

MARCUS	It's the best. Not just because that's the name of it. I mean it. Don't believe me?

COLETTE	No.

MARCUS	Then you have to try it.

COLETTE	(humoring him) Sure, why not.

MARCUS	(to Jonathan) Brownie and hot chocolate, please, Jonathan.

COLETTE	Thanks.

MARCUS	See you later?

COLETTE	Come by the cafe anytime. Mom?!

SANDRA	What's the big hurry?

COLETTE	Try this.

SANDRA	All right. It's fine. Just like it always is.

COLETTE	This isn't mine. Someone has copied my recipe and is selling it as their own!

SANDRA	Who would do that?

COLETTE	That man from the Christmas kickoff! The new shop owner right next to me? He calls it the "Best Hot Chocolate Ever" on his menu.

SANDRA	There must be something different.
 
COLETTE	Nope--the same, right?

SANDRA	Hmmm.

COLETTE	What if he stole it?

SANDRA	He seemed too nice for that.

COLETTE	We just met him.

SANDRA	Honey, before you make accusations, talk to the man first.

NIKKI	Are you sure it's the same?

COLETTE	Yes. Can't you taste the vanilla? It's fresh! And the cayenne pepper?

NIKKI	Things taste different when they are cold.

COLETTE	You're right. We need a fresh cup.

NIKKI	What, now?

COLETTE	Yes. I want to try a second batch. You know, see how it tastes today. And you can't go because....I don't want him to see me.

NIKKI	Right.

COLETTE	Just go. Casually ask what's in it, see if you notice anything like mine that they do. Leave your apron! And don't tell him you work here. Just be anonymous.

NIKKI	(deadpan) Should I wear dark sunglasses and a hat to hide who I am?

COLETTE	Do you have a hat? Just go. But play it cool. Got it?

JONATHAN	What can I get you?

NIKKI	Uh, your hot chocolate.

JONATHAN	Anything else?
 
NIKKI	Oh. Uh, no.

JONATHAN	Here you go.

NIKKI	Thanks. Oh--So, best hot chocolate, huh?

JONATHAN	Uh yeah.

NIKKI	Must be pretty special.

JONATHAN	I guess.

NIKKI	So....why is it special?

JONATHAN	What do you mean?

NIKKI	I mean, what makes it taste so good?

JONATHAN	Milk and chocolate, I guess.

NIKKI	So you use chocolate?

JONATHAN	Kind of a key ingredient.

NIKKI	Gotcha. Any other? Ingredients? That was horrifying.

COLETTE	So? What'd you learn? What's in it?

NIKKI	All I got was milk, and chocolate.

COLETTE	Well, yeah. But what type of chocolate? Is it the type we use? Did he mention fresh vanilla?

NIKKI	No. He had other customers coming in, and I made a fool of myself enough that even he was uncomfortable.

COLETTE	But there had to be something you figured out.

NIKKI	Yes, I learned that culinary espionage is not for me.

COLETTE	Wait. Grab two empty cups. Don't look. 
 
NIKKI	What--

COLETTE	Close your eyes.

NIKKI	This is the most bizarre day ever....

COLETTE	Okay. Open.

NIKKI	Let me guess. You want me to try each one.

COLETTE	Yes, I do.

NIKKI	Tastes great.

COLETTE	And this one?

NIKKI	Also great....

COLETTE	Which one's mine?

NIKKI	I...I can't tell.

COLETTE	See? It's definitely the same.

JONATHAN	Another Christmas order.

MARCUS	Thanks. I'm going to grab some lunch real quick. You okay here?

JONATHAN	Yeah.

MARCUS	All right. I'll be back soon.

COLETTE	Uh, excuse me! Marcus!

MARCUS	Hey, Colette. You all right? Is something wrong with the hot chocolate?

COLETTE	Yes. It tastes just like my recipe.

MARCUS	Come again?

COLETTE	This has to be the same recipe as mine, which I use for my hot chocolate at my cafe.

MARCUS	Well, I'm sure it's not the same. Mine is a proprietary recipe.

COLETTE	Is it? (beat) Did you purposely seek me out at the Christmas Kickoff?

MARCUS	What? Why would I?

COLETTE	To try to reverse engineer it or something.

MARCUS	Hang on. First off, I bought coffee from you that night. Second, there are a lot of ways to make hot chocolate. I doubt it's the same.

COLETTE	It's identical.

MARCUS	How do you know?

COLETTE	I tasted it! Come to my cafe and we'll compare, side by side.

MARCUS	Why don't you just tell me what's in your recipe?

COLETTE	No way. You'd love that. Me spilling my secret recipe?

MARCUS	Then how am I supposed to know?

COLETTE	You tell me what's in your recipe.

MARCUS	Well, I can't do that either. Seriously, let's think this through. Why would I--or anyone, for that matter--try to imitate your hot chocolate recipe?

COLETTE	Because it's that good, and I'm your competition. Maybe you realized my cafe was going to make things harder for your little dessert shop.

MARCUS	I could have opened my shop at a dozen other places but I picked that spot because I thought it'd complement the businesses around it.

COLETTE	Oh, I'm sure. You have to stop serving your hot chocolate. You're encroaching on my business.

MARCUS	No way. It's a free marketplace, and my customers come for delicious sweets. Besides, how do I know you're not making this all up to steal my customers?

COLETTE	That's ridiculous.

MARCUS	This whole thing is ridiculous, I'll give you that. Look, I promise I'm not stealing your hot chocolate or your customers—

COLETTE	Hi Mallory--Is that....

MALLORY	It's just dessert.
 
COLETTE	And?

MALLORY	(defeated) Hot chocolate.

COLETTE	See?!

MARCUS	It's not my fault if customers like my recipe better than yours.

COLETTE	There.

MARCUS	"Home of the Original Heavenly Hot Chocolate. Don't be fooled by copycats." (under his breath) Of all the things....

STEVEN	She what?

MARCUS	Colette's under the delusion that I stole her hot chocolate recipe. Or that I'm copying it somehow.

STEVEN	You've been making that hot chocolate for years. Even back in college. A little bigger. Don't tell Angie.

MARCUS	That's what kept you going when you had your all-nighters for papers.

STEVEN	The one bright spot for procrastination. Why does she think it's the same?

MARCUS	She swears it tastes "identical."

STEVEN	It's hot chocolate; no offense, but how many variations are there?

MARCUS	That's what I said.

STEVEN	Have you tasted her version?
 
MARCUS	No. I'm not sure I want to. She seemed really great when we first met, but now, I think it's better to keep my distance and not feed her paranoia.
 
STEVEN	Hmmm. Maybe we should have opened up the shop at that other location across town.

MARCUS	Too late. You always worry about your neighbors when you move somewhere new but with business? I didn't realize those neighbors could be worse.

STEVEN	Do you think she'll pursue it? Make things difficult for the shop?

MARCUS	I hope not.

STEVEN	Food businesses are hard enough as it is. Remember the statistics about how many fail—

MARCUS	Don't remind me. We'll be okay. She just needs to wake up and realize a little competition is not the end of the world.

COLETTE	The end of the world has come.

SANDRA	No one told me.

COLETTE	My hot chocolate sales are down.

SANDRA	Since when?

COLETTE	Since that copy-cat Marcus opened his shop.

SANDRA	He just opened this week.

COLETTE	It's 20% less than last year's sales this same week.

SANDRA	We had a big cold front about this time last year. So far, it hasn't been too cold.

COLETTE	It's down 15% from just last week before he opened his store.

SANDRA	Your cafe's success doesn't hingeN only on your hot chocolate. I wouldn't panic yet. I'd like a full tree this year. I did the skinny tall tree last year, and it ended up looking emaciated.

COLETTE	I thought it was nice.

SANDRA	Not with my decorations.

COLETTE	How tall?

SANDRA	Hmmm. Less than 6 feet. I'm tired of standing on ladders to decorate.

COLETTE	How about this one?

SANDRA	Hmmm. Maybe. What about for you? You need one.

COLETTE	I have my artificial tree.

SANDRA	Fake. Call it what it is.

COLETTE	Grandma Thea always said it was sensible.

SANDRA	Christmas isn't about reason or sensible. It's about love and celebrating. Splurge a little.

COLETTE	I'm fine. I like my tree as it is.

SANDRA	It's still boxed up, isn't it?

COLETTE	I'll get to it soon. My other sales are down. All since he opened.

SANDRA	Are you sure?

COLETTE	Take a look.

SANDRA	Barely. It's probably a fluke. Your grandma's recipe will bring people back. Maybe customers are swayed to try out that place. But it doesn't mean they'll stick with it.

COLETTE	Yeah. Yeah, you're right. (beat) But the hot chocolate is the same. What if they don't come back to my cafe?

SANDRA	Are you upset about the sales, or that the recipe is so close to Grandma Thea's? Everything will be all right.	If nothing else, Grandma Thea will haunt any wayward customers to come back to you. Stubborn as she was....

COLETTE	Oh! Frank!

FRANK BANNER	Colette. Everything all right?

COLETTE	Yep. Yes. You're...

FRANK BANNER	Yeah. Wanted to try it out myself and see what all the fuss is about.

COLETTE	Oh.

FRANK BANNER	It does taste just like yours.

COLETTE	I know. I don't know how.

FRANK BANNER	Well, last thing the grocery chains are going to want are two products selling the same thing.

COLETTE	I don't think he's selling his in stores. And besides, we're first, right?

FRANK BANNER	Right. Unless he comes around and claims you stole his recipe.

COLETTE	I did not! He—

FRANK BANNER	I'm just saying, last thing you -- or I -- want is a lawsuit or something to make this fail before we even get started.

COLETTE	Well, no need to worry. It's my recipe.

FRANK BANNER	All right. Although, I need that contract back. And how's the dry recipe coming?

COLETTE	Uh, good. I need to work on it more. I've been--Distracted.

FRANK BANNER	As is, we're too late to get it in stores for Christmas. But it'd be a shame to miss the rest of winter. I'm a deadline person. How about we aim to have everything ready, contract and recipe, by next week?

COLETTE	How about two weeks? With Christmas rush and all, the store's been busy. It picks up.

FRANK BANNER	Two weeks then. Oh, one more thing. You ought to figure out what your competition is up to. Just in case.

COLETTE	Here you go.

SIMON	Thanks. Have a good day.

COLETTE	Do you have your phone on you?

SIMON	Yes....Oh no. Nikki warned me—

COLETTE	It'll be easy.

SIMON	She said you said that to her.

COLETTE	You don't even have to say anything other than "One hot chocolate to go."

MARCUS	Hi. What would you like?

SIMON	Uh, one hot chocolate. To go.

MARCUS	Sure. Your order's ready, Colette.

SIMON	Uhhhh, I...

MARCUS	Tell her I'll give her a whole gallon of my hot chocolate if she comes over and gets it herself.

SIMON	Uh, okay. I mean, that's not necessary. Thanks.

COLETTE	He's so arrogant.
 
SIMON	At least he didn't throw me out.

COLETTE	You can't even see what he's doing in this.

SIMON	He serves it from a batch like we do. You can't expect him to make every cup from scratch. Well, I should get back to getting everything ready for the Christmas Kickoff booth.

COLETTE	All right. Wait, I thought Nikki was running it this weekend.

SIMON	We tossed a coin. I lost. Here.

COLETTE	No, I don't want it.

SIMON	Wow. This really does taste like—

COLETTE	I know!

MARCUS	Hi.

COLETTE	Hi.

MARCUS	How was your day?

COLETTE	(Challenging) Fine. Sales were great.

MARCUS	That's great. Ah, look, I know you feel ... threatened about my shop—

COLETTE	I do not!

MARCUS	Well, uneasy then.

COLETTE	I'm not uneasy.

MARCUS	Unhappy? Anyway, there's more to both our places than hot chocolate. And I wanted you to see that. So--There are a few things to try, in case you didn't like the brownie the other day.

COLETTE	Thanks.

MARCUS	Sure. (beat) I recommend milk with those. I mean, you know--you'll be fine whatever you choose.

COLETTE	Okay then.

MARCUS	Okay. Uh, good night.

COLETTE	Night. 3 scoops.... too watery in 6 oz. What am I missing? Maybe a different type of cocoa powder? (talking at the pastries) Sure, you look nice but I bet you're rotten on the inside. Oh, wow. (mutters) How dare he. (to the tree) Hmmmm. This might be your last year. Come on...Maybe. Okay, I'm calling it. Hmmm.

MARCUS	Excuse me. Do you work here?

COLETTE	What? No, I--

MARCUS	Oh.

COLETTE	You.

MARCUS	Yeah.

COLETTE	I was trying to get a better look at this tree.

MARCUS	Oh. It's nice.

COLETTE	Were you -- did you want to get this one?

MARCUS	Oh. Ah, no. I was going for--this one instead.

COLETTE	Nice.

MARCUS	Yeah.

COLETTE	This is for my house.

MARCUS	Oh. Mine too. Ah, excuse me!

COLETTE	Could I get some help?

TREE FARM EMPLOYEE	Sure thing. Which tree did you two decide on?

COLETTE	This one.

TREE FARM EMPLOYEE	So two trees?

COLETTE	Oh, just one for me. We're not—

MARCUS	--Together.

TREE FARM EMPLOYEE	I'll get these ready to go then.

MARCUS	Did you like the pastries?

COLETTE	What? Oh, yeah. (beat) They were good.

MARCUS	I'm glad.

COLETTE	(belatedly) Thanks, for ....

MARCUS	How was the hot chocolate?

COLETTE	Oh you had to bring that up?

MARCUS	I'm just asking. Why are you avoiding it?

COLETTE	I am not.

MARCUS	And now denial.

COLETTE	I am not the one who stole a secret hot chocolate recipe.

MARCUS	No, you're just the one who sent in spies to record my method.

COLETTE	I was trying to prove you use the same method I do, which would mean you stole it.

MARCUS	I did not, and we've been over this.

COLETTE	It's my recipe! My livelihood!

MARCUS	You're a coffee shop.

COLETTE	Cafe.

MARCUS	You're telling me more people buy the hot chocolate than your coffee? Something's wrong with the coffee then.

COLETTE	I have plans for my hot chocolate, and your copy-catting is jeopardizing that.

MARCUS	What plans?

COLETTE	(hesitates) I'm not telling you.

MARCUS	You know, this secretiveness between us hasn't worked so well. So, in the spirit of ... Christmas, why don't you tell me something?

COLETTE	Fine. I'm selling my amazing hot chocolate nation-wide.

MARCUS	How?

COLETTE	I'm working with a company that will take it to grocery stores.

MARCUS	Ah. So you're thinking me and my supposed identical recipe means I am trying to take your grocery store plans too.

COLETTE	Yes. And it is identical.

MARCUS	Still don't believe you on that.

COLETTE	Then you should try my hot chocolate.

MARCUS	You know, I should. At least I could pay you back for all the ones you bought from me.

COLETTE	Ugh! You are so—

MARCUS	Why are you selling it?
 
COLETTE	What?

MARCUS	Your hot chocolate recipe. Why sell it?

COLETTE	I'm not. I mean, it's just a do-it- yourself at home version.

MARCUS	Huh. Okay.

COLETTE	What?

MARCUS	I'd never sell mine.

COLETTE	So?

MARCUS	Just saying.

COLETTE	I'm taking my business to the next level.

MARCUS	All right. That's your decision. (beat) Look, how about this? I promise I won't get in the way of your grand plans.

COLETTE	What about my store?

MARCUS	What about it?

COLETTE	You're selling your hot chocolate, same as me.

MARCUS	I think people coming to my shop are looking for dessert first. Maybe we should give it a little time and see how things go. But we let the customers come and go, without trying to badmouth each other.

COLETTE	That sounds reasonable.

MARCUS	And no more spying.

COLETTE	Fine.

MARCUS	Good. So, truce?

COLETTE	Truce.

MARCUS	Uhh...Come in!

STEVEN	Hello?

MARCUS	Over here.

STEVEN	Need a hand?

MARCUS	Yeah, can you fix the holder? Or hold the tree.

STEVEN	You got it. How were things at the shop today?

MARCUS	Good. I passed 100 pie preorders for Christmas today. Isn't that nuts?

STEVEN	Wow. I didn't expect that many so quickly. How's that?

MARCUS	Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Thanks.

STEVEN	Can you handle making that many pies at once?

MARCUS	Yeah. You'll be helping, won't you?

STEVEN	Ha!

MARCUS	We'll see how desperate I get. At least your garage doesn't have the "holiday rush."

STEVEN	And how's, you know, It's-My-Hot- Chocolate Lady?

MARCUS	Better. I ran into her tonight actually. I think...(smiles) We made progress.

STEVEN	Progress, huh? Is she growing on you?

MARCUS	No. Not that it matters. We have a truce, that's all.

STEVEN	Okay. Good, then.

MARCUS	Yeah. Now we can focus on making Sweet Pastries really take off.

NIKKI	Is that the contract from Frank?

COLETTE	Yeah.

NIKKI	Everything as expected in it?

COLETTE	Yeah, it is. (beat) Do you think I'm doing the right thing if I go forward with it?

NIKKI	It depends on what you want. (beat) Have you thought that maybe putting the mix out there will hurt the store?

COLETTE	You think it will?

NIKKI	It could. But Colette's Cafe is home of the original, so maybe it becomes a must-have if people are nearby.

COLETTE	Marcus said that he'd never sell his.

NIKKI	You're talking to him now?

COLETTE	Kind of.

NIKKI	And?

COLETTE	He's... maybe he's not so bad. And maybe I could have given him the benefit of the doubt. But that's not the point.

NIKKI	It's an improvement. So what does it matter what he says?

COLETTE	Do you think he's right?

NIKKI	I don't know his reasons. (carefully worded) You have to do what you think is best, and right. Hopefully they're the same thing. (beat) How's the dry mix coming?

COLETTE	Not well.

NIKKI	Well, maybe put off signing till you have something worthy to sell.

COLETTE	Good point.

NIKKI	Now what movie are we watching?

COLETTE	You pick.

MARCUS	Hello? What? No. Oh no no no.

FIREMAN	Sir, you can't go in there.

MARCUS	I'm the owner.

FIREMAN	I'm sorry. Just stay out here until we make sure it's safe. All right?

MARCUS	Okay.

NIKKI	Was there a fire?

COLETTE	I think so. Go check on the cafe.

NIKKI	Okay.

COLETTE	Marcus?        

MARCUS	Oh. Hey.

COLETTE	Marcus, I'm so sorry. Any idea what caused this?

MARCUS	They're not sure yet but it came from the kitchen. I didn't leave anything on though.

COLETTE	I'm sure you're right.

MARCUS	Did your shop get damaged? I'm sorry, I didn't even think of that.

COLETTE	Don't worry about that.

MARCUS	So you're fine?

COLETTE	I think so. Nikki's checking, but I... I wanted to see about you.

MARCUS	Well, at least you won't have competition for awhile.

STEVEN	No, everything was in place. I saw to it myself--You're kidding. And after that? (beat) Look, see what you can do. Just, please, ask again. (beat) Right. Bye. You look as horrible as I feel.

MARCUS	The fire chief came by.

STEVEN	(bracing himself) And?

MARCUS	The fire didn't spread beyond our walls. He thinks the structure is sound but the whole inside has to be redone. I set up an appointment with our contractor to go over repairs.

STEVEN	Any idea on the cause?

MARCUS	Might have been an oven. But I don't bake anything in the evenings. There's no way I left anything on. (beat) What was that about?

STEVEN	(hesitates) The insurance company is saying our policy wasn't active.

MARCUS	What?

STEVEN	I know.

MARCUS	We paid those premiums—

STEVEN	During the construction of the inside, yes, but I guess, somehow, it didn't get flipped over once we were functional and... I missed it too.

MARCUS	So to fix everything, we have to—

STEVEN	Out of our pockets. (beat) Angie and I already have everything put into the garage and into Sweet Pastries—

MARCUS	I know.

STEVEN	I wish I had better news.

MARCUS	This isn't a day for that.

CONTRACTOR	Heartbreaking, isn't it? We just had this all done.

MARCUS	Tell me about it.

CONTRACTOR	Well, it's all fixable. That's the good news.

MARCUS	What's the bad?

CONTRACTOR	Cost and schedule. How soon are you wanting to have it repaired?

MARCUS	(in jest) Tomorrow?

CONTRACTOR	Winter gets busier than you'd think. Everyone decides to remodel. I'm booked for the next two months.

MARCUS	Any chance you know someone who can help get things moving, with an open schedule?

CONTRACTOR	No one I'd hire. But you can do a lot yourself if you want.

MARCUS	I can?

CONTRACTOR	It'd save on cost too. You just have to do things right, of course, but I can fit into my schedule checking up on the work, overseeing it here and there.

MARCUS	That'd help. Can you send me a bid for everything?

CONTRACTOR	With you doing some of the work or without?

MARCUS	Both, if you don't mind.

CONTRACTOR	You got it. I'll send it tonight.

MARCUS	Thanks.

SANDRA	How's that business next to yours, with the fire?
 
COLETTE	Not great. Marcus is... he's crushed. (beat) What should I do?

SANDRA	What do you mean? It's not your shop.

COLETTE	Yeah but.... I've been so mean to him. I feel ... guilty.

SANDRA	It's not like you damaged his shop. (beat) Did you?

COLETTE	(glares) Of course not. (beat) He said something about me not having to worry about the competition anymore.

SANDRA	Oh, now that's uncalled for.

COLETTE	He wasn't being cruel about it, but...I don't want to succeed because of someone else's tragedy.

SANDRA	Well, even if you could do something, what would really help?

COLETTE	Hungry?

MARCUS	Oh. What are you doing here?

COLETTE	I thought you might need a break.

MARCUS	I haven't even started.

COLETTE	Let me. Here. Eat up.

MARCUS	Thanks.

COLETTE	How long until everything can be repaired?

MARCUS	I'm trying to figure that out. The harder thing is ... well, it's going to be pricey to fix.

COLETTE	Really? Why's that?

MARCUS	A snafu with the insurance. We're going to have to fix everything, or...

COLETTE	Or what?

MARCUS	Or ... maybe this wasn't meant to be.

COLETTE	You'd close down? You can't do that.

MARCUS	It's not like I want to. But would you really be disappointed if I did?

COLETTE	I suppose I deserved that. (beat) You know what might help keep you in business?

MARCUS	Besides fixing this shop?

COLETTE	Sell your pastries at the Christmas Kickoff.

MARCUS	Didn't that already happen?

COLETTE	Yes, but it continues every weekend till Christmas. Set up a booth and sell your desserts.

MARCUS	Except I don't have my kitchen working.

COLETTE	What about your home?

MARCUS	Hmmm. That could work. (thinking) I could also sell more pie preorders for Christmas.

COLETTE	See?

MARCUS	All right. Thanks.

COLETTE	And for the record, yes. I would be disappointed if you shut down.

MARCUS	Why?

COLETTE	We wouldn't see whose hot chocolate sells better.

MARCUS	Wow. This does taste like mine.

COLETTE	You mean your recipe tastes like mine. I hope your recipe isn't damaged with all this.

MARCUS	No, it's in my safe.

COLETTE	You keep your recipes in a safe? Mine are at home, and in my memory, of course.

MARCUS	I promised I'd keep the recipe under lock and key, so no choice.

COLETTE	Promised who?

MARCUS	The woman who gave me the recipe.

COLETTE	So it's not yours?

MARCUS	No, it's completely Thea's.

COLETTE	Did you say 'Thea'?

MARCUS	Yes.... Thea Redmond? How do you know her name?

COLETTE	She's my grandmother.

MARCUS	I was 8 years old when I met Thea. She was our next-door neighbor. My mom died when I was younger and my dad did his best to take care of me and provide but it was a lot to juggle. Thea noticed. She'd keep me out of trouble after I got home from school. I had to get my homework done first, of course; she was firm about that. But then she'd teach me to cook. And she'd always have her hot chocolate ready. It didn't matter even when it was warm outside; I loved it.

COLETTE	We lived far away from her when I was that age. I never knew ...

MARCUS	I was just the neighbor boy.

COLETTE	You had to have been more than that.

MARCUS	I don't know. But she....(beat) I didn't mind my dad being busy because Thea was there. I wonder if he knew how much she did for us. So she taught you the recipe? No, not at first. I could tell it was special to her. She just had the hot chocolate ready when I'd come over. But one year, after I turned 11 I think, my dad got a new job. We had to move. It was just before Christmas time. (beat) I was pretty upset about it. Thea asked what I wanted for Christmas since she wouldn't see me.

COLETTE	What did you say?

MARCUS	I asked her to teach me how to make it, so I could always remember her, and make it for myself wherever we moved to.

COLETTE	I ... I had no idea. She guarded that recipe so much. I always assumed I was the only one who knew it.

MARCUS	Sorry. It probably seems out of place that I have it too.

COLETTE	No. (beat) No, it's fine. How could Grandma Thea give the recipe to someone else? And this was years before she gave it to me!
 
SANDRA	I gave up trying to understand her. I certainly never pegged her for taking in some stranger's boy.

COLETTE	She never told you about this?

SANDRA	What's the boy's name?

COLETTE	Marcus. And he's grown now, of course.

SANDRA	No, I don't recognize it. She did whatever crossed her mind, but it's very out of character for her. Way too....

COLETTE	What?

SANDRA	Charitable.

COLETTE	She was so strict when she taught me how to make the hot chocolate.

SANDRA	Just then?

COLETTE	I was about to go to college. Over and over again we made it, with her critiquing how I did it, the order of ingredients, getting the temperatures just right, not scalding the milk or the melted chocolate.

SANDRA	That's how she was.

COLETTE	It did make me cherish it though. (grins) Out of fear of getting it wrong at first but... now it's her legacy. (beat) I thought I was the only one to carry it on.

MARCUS	The contractor sent us a bid with and without us doing whatever labor possible.

STEVEN	Yeah, we're going to have to do some of the work ourselves for sure.

MARCUS	Both money and time-wise, we can't afford to wait for them to get to us.

STEVEN	The more time we're closed, the less money we make.

MARCUS	It's bad enough being closed during the holidays--worst timing ever. (beat) I know how to do some of the sheetrock stuff.

STEVEN	Sheetrock "stuff"?

MARCUS	A little. And clearing out the rest of the debris and damaged things, that can't be too hard.

STEVEN	I have to keep the garage open but I can close early if it's a slow day.

MARCUS	Good.

STEVEN	You should get your employee to help. Jonathan?

MARCUS	He already quit.

STEVEN	What?

MARCUS	Well, not like he's experienced with renovation and construction anyway. I think he's already got another job.

STEVEN	Kids these days....

MARCUS	I just don't know how we're going to pay for the rest though. I mean, I can pull together some money for the supplies for the work we'd do, but we'll still have to pay the contractor and his subs for work we can't do ourselves.

STEVEN	The first time around was expensive enough. (beat) Let's do what we can and get the first steps started. I have a little to cover that.

MARCUS	Okay. But the rest?

STEVEN	We're going to need a loan.

MARCUS	We already have the one loan for opening the store. Do you think we can get another one?

STEVEN	It's worth a shot. How else do we get Sweet Pastries on its feet again?

MARCUS	Okay.

STEVEN	I'll work on the loan then.

MARCUS	I'll get going on fixing the shop, and--oh, the Christmas pie preorders. Colette actually had a great idea for how to sell more even with the shop closed for repairs.

STEVEN	Great. Where are you going to make the pies though?

MARCUS	My house.

STEVEN	I guess that'll work. Let's get going.

COLETTE	Have a good day.

SIMON	Is he okay over there?

COLETTE	Maybe I should check.

STEVEN	I turned in the application for the second loan.

MARCUS	Good. Fingers crossed. How long will it take?

STEVEN	Normally a couple of weeks, they said.

COLETTE	Everything okay over here?

MARCUS	As well as it can be. Colette, this is Steven and Angie.

COLETTE	Hi.

STEVEN	The paranoid hot chocolate lady?

ANGIE	Steven!

COLETTE	Guilty.

ANGIE	Nice to meet you.

COLETTE	Do they know what they're doing?

MARCUS	Yeah. You know, it's just a little demolition.

COLETTE	I could tell. We can all hear it next door.
 
MARCUS	Sorry.

COLETTE	I just wanted to make sure you're, you know, safe.

MARCUS	Not hitting Steven's hand with a hammer?

COLETTE	Yeah, like that. There's so much to do.

STEVEN	Tell me about it.

COLETTE	Do you need help?

STEVEN/ANGIE	Yes--


MARCUS	No, we've got it. I'm sure you are plenty busy yourself.

COLETTE	I'll be right back. How are you doing? Got it handled?

SIMON	Yeah.

COLETTE	Good. Call Nikki--ask her to come prep everything for the Kickoff. I'll come get it all at 5 o'clock.

SIMON	Okay... What are you doing in the meantime?

COLETTE	Helping.

MARCUS	Yeah, we have someone coming to fix that and the rest of the electrical.

COLETTE	It's almost time for the Christmas Kickoff to start for the weekend. Did you get a booth?

MARCUS	Oh! Yes. I was up last night baking everything.

COLETTE	I have to grab my things for it. Meet you there?

MARCUS	Sure.

COLETTE	See you later, Angie, Steven.

ANGIE	Bye! Thanks for you help!

STEVEN	See ya! I'll finish up here. You go ahead.

MARCUS	Thanks.

STEVEN	Have fun!

MARCUS	I want you to notice I only have my desserts and pie preorders here. No hot chocolate.

COLETTE	You didn't have to leave out the hot chocolate.
 
MARCUS	And you didn't have to help me today.

COLETTE	I wanted to. Besides, it's Christmas, and...(beat) And Grandma Thea would want me to as well.

PIE CUSTOMER	Hi--Sweet Pastries, right? I tried to go by your store but it's closed up.

MARCUS	Yeah, we had a fire.

PIE CUSTOMER	Oh, how horrible!

MARCUS	Yeah.

PIE CUSTOMER	Um, well, I ordered some pies for Christmas.	Will I still be able to get those?

MARCUS	Ah, I will have them ready, as planned.

PIE CUSTOMER	Oh good. Where do I go then to pick them up?

MARCUS	Uh, I....

COLETTE	You can pick them up just next door to Sweet Pastries, at Colette's Cafe.

PIE CUSTOMER	Oh okay. Anytime on December 23rd?

MARCUS	Yes. We'll have it ready.

PIE CUSTOMER	Good. Thank you! And Merry Christmas!

MARCUS	Merry Christmas. (to Colette) Thanks.

COLETTE	It makes sense. Don't worry about it.

MARCUS	Are you sure? I might take over your shop that day.

COLETTE	It's just one day.

HOT CHOCOLATE CUSTOMER	2 Hot Chocolates please.

COLETTE	Sure. It'll just be a minute.

MARCUS	How's the sale of your recipe, or you know, the hot chocolate going?

COLETTE	Oh, that.

MARCUS	Changed your mind?

COLETTE	(defensive) No.(relents) But I'm having trouble coming up with a traditional dry version for consumers.

MARCUS	Dry version? Traditional? (laughs) There's nothing traditional about Thea's hot chocolate.

COLETTE	I know. It's hard to replicate in an easy form.

MARCUS	That's your problem then. You're thinking about it wrong.

COLETTE	What do you mean? (to the Hot Chocolate Customer) Here you go.

MARCUS	Thea's recipe is gourmet. What we make in our shops isn't ordinary. You can't make it like everyone else does at a grocery store.

COLETTE	But then how?

MARCUS	Maybe you should do a liquid version.

COLETTE	But people are used to—

MARCUS	Yeah, yeah, but that's the whole point. This is special; so make it special. A gourmet drink. Stick it in the refrigerated section. Reheat and enjoy.

COLETTE	Hmmm. Limited shelf life. Transporting it would be harder, or at least have to happen faster.... but.... it could work. Better than anything I've come up with. Great idea.

NIKKI	Number 98!

FRANK BANNER	Excuse me.

NIKKI	Sorry to keep you waiting. Oh. Mr. Banner.

FRANK BANNER	Is Colette in?

NIKKI	No. She's been out today.

FRANK BANNER	Hmmm. Tell her I've been waiting to hear from her. Deadline's almost up.

NIKKI	I will pass that on.

SANDRA	So then you'll sell this just like you make it at the cafe?

COLETTE	Yes. I'm not sure how to make it keep longer though.

SANDRA	Preservatives.

COLETTE	Grandma wouldn't like that.

SANDRA	You're going to have to compromise on something. At least this should taste a lot better than the dry stuff you were mixing up.

COLETTE	It better.

SANDRA	What are you doing?

COLETTE	Testing which method of reheating works best.

SANDRA	Hmmm. Everyone uses the microwave.

COLETTE	That may be, but I want to compare so I can recommend which way on the packaging.

SANDRA	Look at you, being all gourmet.

COLETTE	That's the idea. Here you go. And this one too.

SANDRA	Both good.

COLETTE	Any difference?

SANDRA	The temperature.

COLETTE	I wonder if I should tell people the right temperature to heat it to.

SANDRA	No one is going to check it with a thermometer. People just want a quick cup of hot chocolate.

COLETTE	Quick and yummy.

SANDRA	That too. How's that boy Grandma helped out?

COLETTE	Marcus? He's ... well, it could be better.

SANDRA	Hmmm. Shame about his store.

COLETTE	Yeah.

SANDRA	Is he a good sort of person?

COLETTE	I think so. Why?

SANDRA	Just curious. (lightly) With my mother's influence, you can't be sure how he turned out.

COLETTE	She wasn't always difficult.

SANDRA	No. But those are the memories that stick out.

COLETTE	Maybe you should try to remember the good. There are probably more memories like that, if you let yourself think about it.

NIKKI	Good morning!

COLETTE	Hey Nikki. How was your evening?

NIKKI	Fine. I picked out my own presents for Christmas.

COLETTE	Is this for your parents to give you?

NIKKI	Yes. They say I'm too picky so this way they don't have to worry if I don't like anything. Hey, Frank Banner came by again yesterday.

COLETTE	What'd he say?
 
NIKKI	He was checking up on you.

COLETTE	Well, I may have a solution for the store bought version.

NIKKI	Good. (beat) You know, it's been busy here.

COLETTE	Sorry, I know.

NIKKI	I'm just saying... maybe you're taking on too much.

STEVEN	Sign here too. And here.

MARCUS	I thought we already did everything.

STEVEN	They wanted us to fill these out as well. And that should be all. Yep. I'll take this back to them.

MARCUS	Okay. Let's hope this goes through.
 
STEVEN	Yeah. See you later. Hey Colette.

COLETTE	Hi Steven. How's it coming?

MARCUS	The electrical is underway. Then we can do the sheetrock. Steven's nervous though. A lot depends if we can get a second loan.

COLETTE	Sorry.

MARCUS	I wonder what Thea would say about all this.

COLETTE	Which part?

MARCUS	What to do in my situation.

COLETTE	Hmmm. I remember little one-line pearls of wisdom she'd say. Like, to get me not to go overboard with candy when I was little—

MARCUS	"A small bite won't bite you back with a tummy ache."

COLETTE	Yes!

MARCUS	Or she'd say "cleaning up a little each day keeps the tears--"
 
COLETTE	"--At bay." I sometimes wonder how much my mother fought her about cleaning her room.

MARCUS	Often enough that Thea came up with a saying for it. So what would she say to me now?

COLETTE	She'd say... "the solution will appear if your determination doesn't disappear."

MARCUS	Did she ever say that?

COLETTE	(laughs) No, I just made that up. But it sounds like her.

MARCUS	It does. (beat) Maybe you're right though.

COLETTE	What are you thinking?

MARCUS	That... I may not have it all figured out, but I can take it a step at a time. For example, let the electrical work keep going while I move forward with making the Christmas preordered pies. After that hurdle, maybe we'll be prepared for the next challenge.

COLETTE	Exactly.

MARCUS	Everything okay?
 
COLETTE	My mom. She's reminding me about dinner. (beat) Why don't you come?

MARCUS	Oh, I couldn't—

COLETTE	I think she'd love to meet you, with you knowing my grandma.

MARCUS	Yeah? Okay. What time?

SANDRA	Hello!

COLETTE	Mom, this is Marcus.

MARCUS	Nice to meet you. This is for you.

SANDRA	Oh thank you. So you're the one.

MARCUS	I guess so. Hmmmm. (smiles)

SANDRA	Come on in. There's more if you'd like.

MARCUS	Oh no. I'm getting full.
 
SANDRA	This was one of my mother's recipes. One of my favorites that I craved.

MARCUS	I can tell fine cooking runs in the family.

SANDRA	Well, thank you. I've heard you make amazing desserts.

MARCUS	You did?

SANDRA	I can't vouch for it myself since Colette ate the whole box of—

COLETTE	I did not. Not all at once, anyway.

MARCUS	(to Sandra) I'll bring you a whole box of choices just for you.

SANDRA	Thank you.

COLETTE	You have a lot to bake for those Christmas orders.	Are you really going to make them all at your house?

MARCUS	I'm gonna try.

COLETTE	But then you have to bring them to my cafe for people to pick up.

MARCUS	Yeah, but that's not too hard.

SANDRA	Why not make everything at the cafe?

MARCUS	Oh, I couldn't. It's a lot of pies.

COLETTE	The kitchen can handle it.

MARCUS	Are you serious?

COLETTE	Yes.

MARCUS	That would be... amazing.

COLETTE	When do you want to start?

MARCUS	Tomorrow night, after the cafe closes?

COLETTE	You got it. I'll get Nikki and Simon to help us too.

MARCUS	Thanks, that'd be....(beat, sincerely) Thank you.

COLETTE	Mom, the oven--can I turn it off now?

SANDRA	Yes, please. Just take out the pan too. Now, Marcus. I have to know. Was my mother a stickler for rules with you too? Doing things her way or not at all?

MARCUS	Yes.

SANDRA	And you survived. Good for you.

MARCUS	She wasn't harsh though. Whatever she taught me was to help me be better.

SANDRA	Ugh. I can hear her saying that. She brainwashed you.

MARCUS	Maybe. But I needed someone to show me I could be better.

SANDRA	I wonder what made her decide to look after you.

MARCUS	I've wondered that myself every now and then. Maybe she saw a bored boy who needed some attention.

SANDRA	Could be. I told Colette it was so unlike her.

MARCUS	I wouldn't know that. It didn't stop her though. Maybe she saw that she could make a difference.

SANDRA	(beat) Perhaps. It sounds like there was a side of her that I didn't see.

MARCUS	Your mother was a great woman.

SANDRA	Maybe she was. Greater than I give her credit for. Well. Dessert should be cool enough.

MARCUS	(to Colette) Was it something I said?

COLETTE	I think so. It's a good thing though.

MARCUS	When did Thea pass away?

COLETTE	Six years ago. Christmas time, actually.

MARCUS	I wish I had reached out to her. Part of me figured, what are the odds I'd ever see her again? I was just a kid and it's been so long since then.

COLETTE	Yeah.

MARCUS	I kind of think she'd be laughing at us, what with us running into each other, and the whole hot chocolate thing.

COLETTE	Me too. Although, to be honest, I'd be afraid she'd somehow favor you to succeed over me.

MARCUS	No, I don't think she would. Who knows--maybe she regretted giving me the recipe.

COLETTE	Regret and Grandma Thea don't go together. That's one thing I admired about her. Whatever she decided to do, she owned it. No regrets. (beat) I bet she knows everything is all right.

MARCUS	I hope so.

COLETTE	She'd be happy. (beat) The recipe's in good hands.

MARCUS	(softly) Yes, it is.

SANDRA	All right now. It's no fine pastry but here's a little dessert to finish us off.
 
ANGIE	That's going to be a lot of pies to make.

MARCUS	We can do it. The three of us, plus Colette and her two employees--that's a lot of extra hands.

ANGIE	Compared to just you baking pies all night, yes.

STEVEN	It sure is nice of Colette to offer to help.

MARCUS	I can hear your tone.

STEVEN	Good, because I wasn't hiding it.

MARCUS	Yes, it is nice of her. And I appreciate it.

STEVEN	I'm thinking she wouldn't offer if, you know...

MARCUS	What?

ANGIE	If she didn't like you.

MARCUS	This is just like college, with that girl down the hall that you teased me about.

STEVEN	Kind of, but the difference is you have a shot with Colette.

ANGIE	Go easy on him.

MARCUS	Oh come on.
 
STEVEN	What? Just saying.

MARCUS	Yes, but when you say things like that, you jinx it for me. So--shush.

STEVEN	So that means you are interested in her?

MARCUS	What did I just say?

COLETTE	(under her breath, talking to herself) Measuring cups, whisks....Hey!

MARCUS	Hi. You sure you have space for all this?

NIKKI	No.

COLETTE	Yes. I can make it fit.

SIMON	Colette, Frank Banner is here asking for you again.
 
COLETTE	Nikki, can you--
 
NIKKI	I'll get everything organized.

FRANK BANNER	Colette. I need to get this process going--are we moving forward or not?

COLETTE	Sorry. I have made progress. I decided to do a liquid version of the hot chocolate.

FRANK BANNER	That's going to be more pricey. And it changes the placement in the grocery stores. But I can work on it. You have that signed contract?

COLETTE	No, not with me. Tomorrow, all right?

FRANK BANNER	I'll hold you to that.

COLETTE	Great. Thanks!

FRANK BANNER	Oh Colette--

COLETTE	Anyone need an apron?

STEVEN	I'm warning you all now, the cooking thing is all Marcus--not me.

MARCUS	You can follow instructions.

ANGIE	Use small words though.

MARCUS	Thank you all for being willing to help.

COLETTE	Put us to work.

MARCUS	All right. The fridge is filled with all the ingredients you'll need, plus what's out here on the counters. Let me know if you have questions, but I'll circle around and make sure things are looking right.

NIKKI	Is sampling prohibited? Marcus is a good guy.

COLETTE	Yeah, he is.

NIKKI	So what's going on between you?

COLETTE	Nothing. Why? I thought you said I was taking on too much as it was.

NIKKI	Yeah, but my concern was Frank Banner, not Marcus.

COLETTE	Oh. You don't like this deal with Frank, do you?

NIKKI	It's not my call.

COLETTE	But if it were?

NIKKI	(beat) Why have you been stalling to give him the contract? But, like I said, it's not my decision.

COLETTE	So ... what do you think of Marcus?

NIKKI	Marcus? I can tell you two have a bond.

COLETTE	That's just because of my grandma. It's a common ground between us.

NIKKI	Nothing more?

COLETTE	Maybe a little more than that.

MARCUS	Order 230?

STEVEN	Uh, Chocolate Marshmallow Silk and the Pumpkin one.

MARCUS	Pumpkin vanilla custard.

STEVEN	We just pulled an all-nighter making pies. Give me a break.

MARCUS	Merry Christmas. Hi, what's your order number?

PIE CUSTOMER	183.

STEVEN	Apple cream.

PIE CUSTOMER	Thank you!

MARCUS	Merry Christmas.

STEVEN	Ah, hang on. Marcus, take over. Hello?

MARCUS	Uh, okay.

STEVEN	(on the phone) But we filled out the...I understand. Is there any way to reconsider? What else would help? (beat) I... okay. (defeated) Merry Christmas.

MARCUS	What?

STEVEN	The bank turned down the second loan.

MARCUS	Hi. Order number?

NIKKI	Is Frank coming by today?

COLETTE	Oh. Um, probably. I'm just reading over this one more... time....No. (beat) Frank's not coming. Frank. It's Colette. (beat) Listen, I've given it a lot of thought, and... I don't think this is going to work out. Good turnout, huh?

MARCUS	Yeah. Thanks for letting me use the cafe, and for all your help.

COLETTE	Sure. Is everything all right?

MARCUS	The bank denied the second loan. (beat) Steven is freaking out.

COLETTE	No. You're joking.

MARCUS	I wish. Um, I need to check on the electrician next door.

COLETTE	Leave this all here. I'll put everything back.

MARCUS	You sure? Thanks. If someone comes for these....

COLETTE	I'll take care of it.

MARCUS	Thanks. Hopefully we figure this out and you can come finish the rest someday.

ELECTRICIAN	Good luck.

MARCUS	Yeah.

FRANK BANNER	Excuse me. I'm looking for Marcus?

MARCUS	That's me.

FRANK BANNER	I understand you have a pretty popular hot chocolate recipe. I'd be interested in taking it nationwide.
 
NIKKI	What if he's selling the recipe to Frank?

COLETTE	We don't know that's what Frank was talking to him about.

NIKKI	Come on, Colette. What else could it be? If he's selling it, are you going to let him? It's not right.

COLETTE	It's... It's not for me to decide for him.

NIKKI	What?

COLETTE	Grandma Thea gave it to him, and to me. He has just as much right to sell it as I do.

NIKKI	You didn't sell it.

COLETTE	I know. But I won't hinder him like I did before.

NIKKI	But--

COLETTE	If that recipe could save his shop, could I really live with myself trying to stop that?

MALLORY	Hi Colette.

COLETTE	Mallory. Good to see you.

MALLORY	You too. So do you know what's going to happen next door?

COLETTE	I... I don't. Sorry.

MALLORY	I hope it opens up again. I loved their pies. (whispers conspiratorial) But your hot chocolate was better.

COLETTE	Thanks. Merry Christmas.

MALLORY	You too.

MARCUS	Hi.

COLETTE	Hi. How's Steven?

MARCUS	He's coping.

COLETTE	And you?

MARCUS	I'm... figuring some things out.

COLETTE	Like what?

MARCUS	How to recoup whatever we can. But it's going to be fine.

COLETTE	Did... did Frank Banner reach out to you then?

MARCUS	Yeah, he did. (beat) I was surprised you decided not to sell.

COLETTE	It... it wasn't the right decision, for me.

MARCUS	Me neither.

COLETTE	Really?

MARCUS	Now you're surprised?

COLETTE	I guess not, but ... you could have. I mean, you have as much claim to it as me.
 
MARCUS	No. The only one who really did was Thea.

COLETTE	Did you feel that way all along?

MARCUS	Yeah.

COLETTE	Why didn't you say something to me?

MARCUS	She's your grandmother, not mine. Which reminds me....Merry Christmas.

COLETTE	What--you didn't have to--Grandma...

MARCUS	It's a great way to remember her, isn't it?

COLETTE	Yes, it is. Thank you.

MARCUS	Merry Christmas, Colette.

COLETTE	Merry Christmas.
 

LAST MINUTE CUSTOMER	Is there any pie left?

SIMON	Sorry, that was just a temporary thing.

LAST MINUTE CUSTOMER	Oh, too bad.

STEVEN	The whole situation is out of our hands. We just can't do it.

LANDLORD	But your lease isn't even close to being up. We agreed on a year to start.

STEVEN	I know. Believe me, I wish circumstances were different.

LANDLORD	There's also a lot of damage. You expect me to eat the cost?

STEVEN	Let's look it over and find a solution. We've cleared out the damage and started rewiring. Who knows? Your next tenant might want to start fresh anyway.

COLETTE	Steven! Wait up. They have a lot to fix, but the important thing is it is fixable.

SANDRA	How would you do it?

COLETTE	This is the easiest solution.

NIKKI	Can you do that?

COLETTE	Why not?

SANDRA	What about the cafe?

COLETTE	It won't affect the shop.

NIKKI	You sure?

COLETTE	Even if it does, it'll be worth it in the long run.

NIKKI	I like it.

COLETTE	Yeah?

SANDRA	Grandma would too.

COLETTE	What do you think? Can we do it?

STEVEN	Yeah, I don't see why not. I ran it by the Contractor--it's reinforced. It will hold.

COLETTE	Great.

STEVEN	You really want to do this?

COLETTE	I do. But only if you think it makes sense, for both of you.

STEVEN	It does.

ANGIE	How soon are you wanting to do this?

SANDRA	You do realize it's Christmas Eve.

COLETTE	Yeah!

SANDRA	And the ham is warm and ready?

COLETTE	Be right there!

MARCUS	Merry Christmas, Thea. The door bell rings. Marcus goes to answer. It's Steven. Hey!

STEVEN	Merry Christmas!

MARCUS	Thanks, you too.

STEVEN	What are you doing to celebrate today?

MARCUS	Uh....

STEVEN	I was afraid of that. Come over to the house with me and Angie.

MARCUS	No, I couldn't do that.

STEVEN	Why not?

MARCUS	(trying to find a reason) I... I'm fine here. I'm opening presents.

STEVEN	Alone?

MARCUS	You're here, aren't you?

STEVEN	Open mine then. You should at least come over for dinner.

MARCUS	No, that's okay.

STEVEN	Come on. Angie's making that stuffing you like.

MARCUS	Don't tempt me.

STEVEN	Not bad, huh?

MARCUS	Nice, Steven. Nice.

STEVEN	You sure you're okay?

MARCUS	Yeah.

STEVEN	Dinner's at 5 if you change your mind.

MARCUS	Okay. Thanks.

STEVEN	See you.

MARCUS	What are you doing?!

COLETTE	Oh! Hi!

MARCUS	What are you doing?

COLETTE	Tearing down the wall. I ran into Steven and the landlord. They seem excited. This was supposed to be a Christmas surprise for you though.

MARCUS	I'm very much surprised. There's giant hole in the wall. Why is there a hole in the wall?

COLETTE	I'm taking on a new partner. Two, actually. We're combining Sweet! Pastries and Colette's Cafe. I've wanted Colette's Cafe to grow and change for awhile. But this, well, one might call it expanding, adding desserts and making this a hangout for more than the coffee and sandwich crowd. What do you think?

MARCUS	Expanding?

COLETTE	If you're okay with it.	There will be some "pardon our dust" signs in here for awhile, but the cafe can still run while the work is being finished. With the wall gone, it'll open up the space for more seating and the dessert cases. I kind of want to have a whole hot chocolate bar area too, but I especially wanted your input on that too.

MARCUS	Sweet Pastries... here?

COLETTE	Yeah. Steven signed off on it. I'm just waiting for the other half of Sweet! Pastries to agree.

MARCUS	You're serious.

COLETTE	Seems like it. There's a lot of work to do, but we can do most of it ourselves, just like you planned before.

MARCUS	You're... you're doing this for... for me?

COLETTE	(beat) For us.

MARCUS	Why?

COLETTE	Because ... it makes sense. The whole situation with me trying to sell the hot chocolate--I was itching to do something more. But it wasn't the right thing. And then you came along. It's like... it's like it was meant to be. Not at first of course. But I've seen what Grandma must have seen. Someone special. (beat) And thinking about coming here each day without you nearby seemed ... bleak.

MARCUS	I know what you mean.	

COLETTE	You do?	
 
MARCUS	When we first met, I felt there was something about you that I wanted in my life. Even later, I ... I liked you.	

COLETTE	You mean when I was rotten to you?	

MARCUS	(laughs) It wasn't that bad.
	
COLETTE	I'm glad I didn't scare you away. That would be my biggest regret.	

MARCUS	Why's that?
	
COLETTE	Because I'm pretty sure I love you. So....What do you think?

MARCUS	What do we call it?	 

COLETTE	Well, we have Colettes Cafe, sweet ! Pastries, and Thea's hot chocolate. 

MARCUS	How about Thea's? 

COLETTE	Thea's. It's perfect. Merry Christmas.

MARCUS	Merry Christmas.
