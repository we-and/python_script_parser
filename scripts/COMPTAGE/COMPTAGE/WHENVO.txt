KAREN	What we wanna know is where we can stay.  

OPHELIA	It looks like we’re all gonna be roommates.

LISA	Really…

JAMES	We’re free to do what we want, when we want to, with who we want.

OPHELIA	You’re an incredible asshole.

FREDDY	I fuckin’ love college.

KAREN	Is this guy for real?

OPHELIA	Aw, yeah.

JAMES	Who’s your daddy?

BLOND	Brian Talbert.  Why?

LISA	I just want a good education.

JOSE	Whatta ya talkin’ about?

LISA	Hey, you.

JOSE	Hey.

LISA	Hi.

JOSE	What, what’re we doing out here, again?

LISA	We’re makin’ too much noise in the house.

JOSE	We?  You’re doin’ all the screaming.

LISA	And you opened up my eyes and, my legs…  (laughing)  And now, I can’t get enough of what you have to give me.

JOSE	I can’t keep this up, Lisa.

LISA	I beg to differ.

JOSE	If this was a game, I’m coming cross the bar (??) at this point.

LISA	It’s okay, keep coming cross the bar (??)…  (light laughing, light moaning, etc. – continuous)

JOSE	(too soft to hear???)

LISA	Fuck me.  (moaning, etc. – continuous)  (light laughing)  That was good.  (light laugh)  Ah, yeah…

FREDDY	Alright.  Get over it, already.  Stop thinkin’ about what happened.

KAREN	(echo voice)  I can’t believe it’s happening.  Oh my god.  Ah, it’s happening…  (surprised sound!)

FREDDY	(echo voice)  It’s happened…  (V,O,)  No big deal.  Happens to everyone.

KAREN	That’s not strictly true.

FREDDY	Not cool.  Get outta my head.

PROFESSOR	Now, as we were discussing last week, when the pressure was on, the analysts couldn’t get it up.

KAREN	Experts believe that erectile dysfunction affects between 10 to 15 million American.

PROFESSOR	Now, the market was flaccid and there was nothing anybody could do to get it to rise…

KAREN	Apparently, psychological factors are responsible for 20% of all impotent cases…

PROFESSOR	Mr. Silver…

FREDDY	Present.

PROFESSOR	Is there a problem you’d like to discuss with the rest of the class? …

FREDDY	There’s nothing wrong with my schlong, god damn it!

CLASS	(laughing)

PROFESSOR	Okay, okay.  Settle.  Settle.  I think this is a matter we should discuss with the Dean, don’t you, Mr. Silver?

CLASS	(lighter laughing

KAREN	Playing hide and seek, again?

OPHELIA	(very light laugh)  Kind of.  James was sent a package from Hills Brother’s Jewelers.

KAREN	The wedding ring place?  You don’t thing that… ?

OPHELIA	I don’t know what to think, but I know I’m going to find out…  If I were a wedding ring, where would I be?  …  Where are you hiding it, you little bugger…?  Ah, what the hell?

JAMES	Ah, you naughty girl…  Starting without me?

OPHELIA	I was just looking for your package.

JAMES	Oh, baby, you found it…

LISA	(light laughing)

JOSE	Mm, Lisa.

LISA	Um, mm?

JOSE	The whole campus heard us doin’ it.

LISA	So, it’s just sex.  Everybody’s doing it.  (light laugh)

JOSE	Yeah, but, not, not in the middle of Fraternity Row.

LISA	Mm, okay, fuck ‘em, if they can’t take a joke.

JOSE	Yeah, I have a terrible feeling that you just might…

LISA	I’m sorry, Jose.  I’ll make it up to you.  I heard you were bitten by a badger.

JOSE	Huh.  Lisa!

LISA	(light laughing)  What? …

JOSE	It’s for you.

LISA	… Cool.

JOSE	Oh, c’mon.  What… is it?

LISA	Mm…  I love letters.

JOSE	So?

LISA	…  Oh, it’s from Peter.

JOSE	And, he is…?

LISA	Um, my fiancée…

JOSE	Wha, what? …

JOSE	He’s your fiancée?

LISA	We lived on the same street, went to the same school, attended the same bible study.  We were inseparable.  

JOSE	So, he’s your true love.

LISA	Whatta you think?

JOSE	But, he was the one you were saving yourself for.

LISA	And you’re the one I gave myself to.  He gave me a promise ring when we were 13.  (breath sounds)  Where the hell is it?

JOSE	Why’re you so worried about it?  You already broke that promise 3 times today, and counting.

LISA	Oh, no, no, no, no.  He can’t find out about us, about what we’ve been doing.

JOSE	What?  … Why?

LISA	My father already looks at Peter as a son.  Hell, he’s more family then I am…  If I break Peter’s heart, he’ll disown me.

JOSE	I see.

LISA	Jose, it’s just for one day…  You’re not mad, are you?

JOSE	(softly)  No.  You do what you have to do.

LISA	Jose…  (V.O.)  Alright, where’d I have it last?

LISA	(breath sounds, moaning, etc. – continuous)  (V.O.)  I had it when we were screwing in the kitchen.  (moaning, etc. – continuous)

LISA	Ah, oh…

JAMES	Who’s been a bad girl?

OPHELIA	Uh, Condelezza Rice?

JAMES	(light laugh)  Yeah… and…?	

OPHELIA	Um, Miss Piggy?

JAMES	Oh, yes.  And…?

OPHELIA	Me.  I’ve been a bad, bad girl, and I deserve punishment.

JAMES	Ah…

LISA	(breathless)  James!  I need your help.

JAMES	Hello!  Can this wait?

LISA	It’s an emergency.  My fiancée’s on his way.

OPHELIA	You’re engaged?!

LISA	Yeah.  Long story.

JAMES	Okay.  Keep talking.  I’m listening.

LISA	Okay.  I lost my ‘true love waits’ promise ring.

JAMES	And your virginity.

LISA	(talking fast)  I think I know where I lost the ring.  If you can just stall him, while I’ll go get it.  Please…

OPHELIA	He’s all yours.

LISA	(sighs)  Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

JAMES	Okay, okay, one question.  Am I going to get a happy ending?

LISA	Yeah!

KAREN	How long does it take to work?  … Really.  That quick, huh?  … How many pills should I give him?  …  Half a pill? …  And it’ll dissolve in a sandwich?  Great.  Thanks, Doc.  I owe you one…  Oh!

OPHELIA	Oh!

KAREN	Ah, sorry.  My bad.  Ah…

OPHELIA	It’s okay.

KAREN	Let me help you with that.

OPHELIA	Ah…

KAREN	Let’s throw it in the wash…  Actually, I should probably thow mine in the wash, too.  Ah…  I’m so sorry.

OPHELIA	It’s alright.  It’s okay…

OPHELIA	What’s wrong with him?  …  Ah, poor boy.

KAREN	I’m working on it…

PETER	Lisa?  Lisa…  Lisa…

KAREN	Can I help you with something?

PETER	Um, I, is, is there, um, have you…?

KAREN	Whatever you’re selling, I’m not buying.

PETER	Um, no, Lisa, um, Lisa Wilcox?  I, I’m Peter, her fiancée.

KAREN	Fuck me.

PETER	Well, I’m not sure that’s strictly appropriate, judging from the nature of our relationship, but, ah…

KAREN	Lisa…  You got some ‘xlainin’ to do.

JAMES	Damn girl.  Whoo.  Hey, what’s goin’ on, Paul?

PETER	Peter.

JAMES	Peter, Paul, it’s all good.  Listen, Lisa’s up there lookin’ for the key to her chastity belt, so, ah, she asked me to, ah, show ya around.  Let’s go.

FREDDY	Okay.  You can do this.  You can do this!  Ah…  What’s the matter with my god damn schlong.  (frustrated breaths)  … Oh…  Okay, wanna play hard ball?  (laughs)  Daddy’ll play hardball.  Oh!  (laughs)  Oh…  (scream out!)  (crying sounds)

KAREN	Honey, it’ll be okay…  I made you a sandwich.

FREDDY	Whatta these blue bits?

KAREN	Just eat it.

OPHELIA	Something to wash down that sandwich…

JAMES	Yeah, so this is the backyard.  Nice, huh?  Pretty pink roses, don’t ya think?

PETER	Nice rose, yeah.

JAMES	And this, my friend, is the ‘ask it’ ball court.

PETER	You mean basket ball.

JAMES	Oh no.  I mean ‘ask it’ ball…  Check it out…

PETER	No, no, you can’t…

JAMES	…Oh yes, you can.

PETER	How’s that even…?

JAMES	It’s possible.

PETER	Is that legal?

JAMES	In some states…

JAMES	(sad breath sounds)  Harrison Jennings’s old room…  Founder of the Omegas.  I took it over.  Kind of a legacy.

PETER	It’s charming.

JAMES	Guy’s scored more pussy than an animal shelter.  (sad breath sounds)

PETER	It’s okay.

JAMES	(weepy)  Ya know, I miss him…  so much.  (light fake crying, blowing nose)  Okay.  Let’s go.

LISA	I know I lost it here…  Or maybe it was over here…

LISA	Peter’s here!

PETER	Uh, listen, uh, I don’t mean to sound ungrateful or anything, but, I’m only here for one day and I really need to see Lisa.

JAMES	Look, man, I don’t think I should be alone, now.  Okay?

PETER	Were you, ah, and Harrison Jennings close?

JAMES	…  (whispers)  Like that.

PETER	Well, when, when, when did he graduate?

JAMES	… ’74…  C’mon…

FREDDY	(mouth full sound)  What the fuck are you doing?

KAREN	I’m checking your vital signs.  Now, shut up before I take that where the sun don’t shine…  Any minute, now…  Any minute now…

FREDDY	Sorry, Karen.  I appreciate the effort, but, it’s dead down there.

KAREN	The doctor said it would only take 30 minutes, but it’s already been over an hour.

FREDDY	What would take 30 minutes?

KAREN	There’s more to a relationship than just sex…  Where’re you going?

FREDDY	I have, I have to see the Dean.

KAREN	Freddy!

JAMES	Go, girls!

PETER	I really need to get going.

JAMES	No, Harrison, since Harrison left me, it’s like…  there’s a hole inside of me…  Will you fill my hole?  Ah…

PETER	(muffled voice)  I, I’m sorry, but, Lisa’s waiting and…

LISA	(struggle sounds)

PETER	For the love of god, will get off of me!

LISA	Ahh!!  …

PETER	Lisa…

JAMES	Lisa?  …

FREDDY	(softly)  God…  (light laughing… sighs)

GIRL	Yes, Sir…  Sure thing…  Dean Loward will see you now…

FREDDY	Ah… okay…

DEAN	Who said you could sit down?  …  Whatta ya doing with my fern?  Put it down this instant…  Stand up straight…  Anymore shenanigans out of you, young man and I can promise you, the punishment will be quite, quite stiff…  Professor Lasky tells me you keep talking about your penis…  It’s a written warning.  Sign it…  You are one sick, son of a bitch!

LISA	I’m sorry, Peter.  I never meant to just you.

PETER	I know, it, it’s just, well, I wasn’t really expecting this.

LISA	For what it’s worth, I still believe true love waits.

PETER	And that’s why you gave away your precious flower?

LISA	To my true love.  (sigh)  (desperate sounding)  We were 13, Peter, what the hell did we know about true love?

PETER	Lisa…

LISA	And these promise rings were worn for appearances and for us.  I mean, I love you, but…

PETER	Lisa…

LISA	… I mean, I love you, but I don’t know if I really love you, you know…

PETER	Lisa…  Listen.  I came down here to end the relationship, too.

LISA	You found true love, too?

PETER	… His name’s Kevin…

LISA	Huh?

FREDDY	Yes!  (laughing – continuous)  Oh, I love you…  I love you!

OPHELIA	I slipped him half of James’s Viagra stash.	

KAREN	You’re kidding?  …  With the pills I gave him, he should be hard from now until Kingdom come.

OPHELIA	I gotta find this package…

KAREN	I feel like I’ve spent all day worrying about packages.

OPHELIA	Maybe he bought back his grandmother’s ring…  Maybe he’s finally ready to grow up…

JAMES	I’m ready to rock out with my cock out…

FREDDY	Karen!  Thank you!  (laughing)

FREDDY	Karen.

KAREN	(surprised sound!)  The Viagra worked.

FREDDY	I didn’t take any Viagra.

KAREN	Whoo.  You kinda did.  I slipped you a dose.  And, and so did Ophelia.

FREDDY	Fuck it, it words.

KAREN	Uh huh.

FREDDY	(laughs)  Mm…

KAREN	Mm.  (laughs)  I have an idea.  I saw some of your porno.

FREDDY	You’ve been watchin’ my stash?

KAREN	Uh huh.

FREDDY	Baby, I’m in love.

KAREN	Mm. 

FREDDY	Mm…

KAREN	…  Oh my…  Oh my god…  Are you okay?

FREDDY	I think it’s broken…

JOSE	So…  The Impressionist’s Period was a time of…  I can’t do this.  I’m not good at speaking in front of people.

LISA	It’s just me, Jose.

JOSE	Yeah, look how badly I’m doing.  Tomorrow’s goin’ be in front of a panel of professors.

LISA	Well, you know what they say, when you’re scared to speak in public, just picture the audience in their underwear.

JOSE	(very light laugh)  I don’t really wanna picture Professor Lasky in his underwear.  Thanks.

LISA	(very light laugh)  Yeah…  Would this help?  …

JOSE	I’m still nervous…  Better, but, ah, there’s still a few jitters…  Ah, ah, radical center of time.  Early Impressionism began, the rules of modernistic paining.  They began by giving colors, freely brushed, primo zero line (??) drawing inspiration from, the work of great painters, such as Eugene Delecroi…

LISA	Ah, you’re making me so hot…

JOSE	Although, the rise of Impressionism in France happened, at a time when a number of… a time when a number of other…  (voice trails off)

LISA	Great speech.  And now, for your ovation.

FREDDY	Oh, girl, I gotta tell the team about this.  Oh.  Oh…  Oh girl, you were, that’s the spot.  Oh, that’s the…  Oh, man, call home.  What’s a…  Ah…

KAREN	Freddy!  How much longer do I have to do this for?

FREDDY	Until the penis your broke gets better.

KAREN	Get over it already.  It was an accident.

FREDDY	Ah, ah, (light laughing)  you wanna get it right between the toes.  Between the toes.  Yeah, right there, right there…

KAREN	I’ll get it.

FREDDY	Oh… oh…

OPHELIA	… You hear the doorbell ring?

WOMAN	(background TV voice)  … a little too nice, actually…

JAMES	It’s your turn.

OPHELIA	Like hell it is.  I got the last ‘ring.’

WOMAN	(background TV voice)  … Justin, look at that…

JAMES	Didn’t it ring ‘til 12?  (?? – hard to hear)

OPHELIA	Well, maybe they’ll ‘ring’ back.  Give us a ‘ring’ back.  Give me my ring back.

WOMAN	(background TV voice)  I think maybe he’s afraid…

FREDDY	Hey, hey, after you finish the toe job, don’t think I haven’t plans for you.

KAREN	Please don’t make me do it, again.  I almost lost a ping-pong ball last time.

WOMAN	(background TV voice)  I want you to watch this first…

WOMAN	(background TV voice)  I think it’s more important…

KAREN	Guillermo?  What’re you doing here?

GUILLERMO	(something in Spanish… phonetically… )  Estamos se as porno Grande… (???)

OPHELIA	Karen, you know this guy?

KAREN	Yeah.

FREDDY	Why’s your gardener here?

KAREN	You think just ‘cause he’s Mexican he must be a gardener?

FREDDY	Then who is he?

KAREN	My husband…

JAMES	Oh!  This is going to be better than my soaps.

FREDDY	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  You’re married to this guy?

KAREN	If you saw him in bed, you’d be married to him, too.

FREDDY	(softly)  Oh…

KAREN	Mom!

STEP-MOM	Karen!  I, I thought that you were headed, to, ah…

KAREN	Actually, my step-mother…  who I never really liked, but still…

FREDDY	So one look and you thought I gotta gimme some of that.

KAREN	No, that’s not how it went down.

FREDDY	So how did it go down?

KAREN	Actually, it went down like this…

KAREN	Mom!

STEP-MOM	Karen.  I thought that you went down…

DAD	Mildred, have you seen the… gardener?!  (angry sounds)

FREDDY	So he is your gardener.	

KAREN	Needless to say, my dad was less than thrilled.

STEP-MOM	Stop it!  Guillermo, run!!

KAREN	Yeah, it wasn’t pretty.  Guillermo got away, but my dad’s not one to give up and he’s been known to fight dirty.

KAREN	He called the INS on Guillermo and tried to get him deported, so…

OPHELIA	You married him?  …

JAMES	Yeah, that’s what you do when you feel bad for someone.

FREDDY	well, shit, Karen, I failed my mid-terms.  Ya wanna have my baby?

JAMES	(light laugh)

KAREN	Freddy, that would actually require you to be able to fuck me.

JAMES	Oh…

GUILLERMO	(softly – in Spanish??)

KAREN	Guillermo, calm down.  What happened?

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish??)

KAREN	English!  I can’t understand you.

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish…  something…) Nuevo en Mexico.  (??)

KAREN	Ah!!  Jose!  Jose!!

JOSE	Yeah.  Where’s the fire?

KAREN	What’s he saying?

FREDDY	He’s your husband.

JOSE	Well, how am I supposed to know?  …  Oh, because I’m Mexican, I’m supposed to know Spanish?

KAREN	Well, yeah.

JOSE	I was born in Long Beach.  I’ve never been to Mexico in my life.

KAREN	Ah… (frustrated)  Okay.  Slow down.

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish… ) Trouble.  Trouble.  INS, bein aqui (??)  Ah, ah, deported, en no mas. (??) Ah, ah…

KAREN	Okay.  I got ‘trouble.’

OPHELIA	I’m pretty sure I heard ‘deported.’

JAMES	Uh huh…

GUILLERMO	Si…

FREDDY	And INS.  What does that mean?

KAREN	That means we’re in a world of shit.

GUILLERMO	Si…  World of shit.

FREDDY	Oh, now he speaks English.

JAMES	Ah, convenient.

KAREN	Are they investigating us?!

GUILLERMO	Si.

KAREN	And they’re coming here, aqui?

GUILLERMO	Si.  Tomorrow.

KAREN	Oh my god, if INS comes and they find out our marriage is a fake, he’s gonna get deported and I’m gonna get arrested.

JAMES	Ah!  Dun, dun, dun…

KAREN	Guillermo, ah, uno yearo us marriedo?  … Yeah, I have all the paper work to prove it, but, ah, we’ve never lived together and no joint bank accounts, no pictures together, so as our lawyer, I’m asking you what are our chances?

FREDDY	Did you screw the pooch?

GUILLERMO	No.  No sexo with Miss Hargrieves.

FREDDY	Whatta ‘bout the honeymoon?

GUILLERMO	No honeymoon.

KAREN	Freddy, we’ve never had sex! …

KAREN	… Annulled?  Whatta ya mean, annulled?  … You’re telling me that our marriage isn’t valid unless we’ve consummated it?  …  Oh shit.  Shit, yo guys, INS is here.

FREDDY	Man, the man has never looked so good.

KAREN	Stay calm?!  You stay calm!  (weepy)  She’s coming to arrest us.

GUILLERMO	Karen.  No ciento?  It, it’s okay.  I go.

KAREN	There’s only one way outta this…

GUILLERMO	Si?

FREDDY	Wait, you’re not thinkin’ what I think you’re thinkin’?

KAREN	We consummate the marriage.

FREDDY	No!  Over my dead body?  No.

KAREN	Not for real, Reddy.  We fake it.  INS lady comes in and sees us in bed, faking it, and then everything’s cool.

FREDDY	Fake.

KAREN	100%.  Bogus.  Not real at all…

FREDDY	Promise you won’t enjoy it.

KAREN	… I’ll try not to…  Ah.  Okay, I’ll hate every second of it.

FREDDY	Okay…  Fako, pretendo, no sexo.  

KAREN	I promise we won’t do anything you couldn’t do.

FREDDY	See, one more joke about that, I’m outta here.

KAREN	Okay, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  I’ll make it up to you when your penis mends, okay?

GUILLERMO	Your penis is broken?  …

KAREN	Okay, so…  guess we should, get this over with…

INS LADY	INS.  Is there a Karen Hargrieves here?

FREDDY	Karen?  Ah, Karen, ah, let me think, is there a Karen, here?

INS LADY	It’s kinda a yes or no question.

FREDDY	(laughing)  Wow, that’s funny.  You’re funny.  I didn’t think you government suits had a sense of humor, but, ah, ya know, I, wow (laughs), you’re just a regular laugh riot.  (laughs)

INS LADY	Well, I appreciate your critique of my stand-up skills.  I must warn you that it’s a federal offense to lie to an official on government business.

FREDDY	Karen, you say?

INS LADY	Karen Hargrieves.

FREDDY	Oh.  Well, she’s here, yeah.  Ah, upstairs with her husband.  Consummating (coughs) I mean, having sex…  ah… oh, ah… like rabbits (clears throat)  Ah…  Crazy kids, ya know.  (laughs)

PROFESSOR	Okay…  Mr. Ibarra.  You’re up.  Show us what you’ve got…

JOSE	I, I lost my voice.  (clears throat)

PROFESSOR	Your voice is fine.  C’mon.  Knock our socks off…

JOSE	…  (clears throat)  So, like, paintings and shit…

PROFESSOR	Mr. Ibarra, I assume you’re going somewhere with this?

JOSE	So, ah pretty pictures…

JOSE	Post impressionism developed in the 1880’s….  Several artists… began to develop different precepts, for the use of… color, pattern… form and line…

JOSE	Impressionists took advantage, of the mid century introduction of (can’t understand with loud music???… ABOUT MAKING PAINT	, I think) which allowed artists to work more spontaneously…  Previously, painters made their own paint, by grinding… rubbing and…

PROFESSOR	Mr. Ibarra?  Keep going.

LISA	(moaning, etc. –continuous)

JOSE	So that’s why impressionism has such it’s own style and continues to inspire, ah, oh, god…  Oh god…  Oh god…  movement, today.

PROFESSOR	Well, ah, it’s nice to see that you have such enthusiasm for the subject.

JOSE	You have no idea.  I need to go…

LISA	(sigh sound)

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish ??)

KAREN	What was that?

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish ??)

KAREN	Okay.  Remember, this is fake sex, not real, okay?  Fako, pretendo.  Okay?  Let’s make this look good.

GUILLERMO	Si…

FREDDY 	So (light laugh), they’ll be banging away, anytime, now.

INS LADY	How long have you known Miss Hargrieves?

FREDDY	Since school started, a few months.  (light laugh)

INS LADY	Have you met her husband?

FREDDY	Oh, yeah, go way back.  Elmo’s the man.

INS LADY	Guillermo.

FREDDY	Yeah, that’s the dude.  We’re buddies.  Amigos.  Doritos.  (light laugh)  Ah, also, do they let you carry a gun?

INS LADY	We’re not at liberty to say whether or not we carry firearms.

FREDDY	We (something ??)  packin’ heat.  Oh…  So, ah, well, ya ever give a cavity search?

INS LADY	Do you have something to hide, Mr. Silver?

FREDDY	No, but you’re supposed to be real gentle.

INS LADY	You have an unhealthy interest in what it is I do.

FREDDY	I do?  (very light laugh)  I really do.  I always wanted to become an IBS agent.

INS LADY	INS.  IBS is Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

FREDDY	Oh, right up my ally, so to speak…  Oh, ya know, I think actually Karen is over here in the basement.  She spends a lot of her time down here, ya know, allergic to the sun.  Keeps spiders.  Weird chick…  (sigh sound)

JAMES	You better have a ridiculously over-sized check waiting for me.

STEP-MOM	Nobody told me it was a toga party.

JAMES	Ah, yeah, um…  Listen, whatever you’re selling, I’m buying.

STEP-MOM	Darlin’, you can’t afford me.

JAMES	If you’re trying to seduce me, it’s working.  Keep it coming.

STEP-MOM	Mm…

OPHELIA	I’ll sign for it.  I’ll sign…  Sorry.

JAMES	Sign for what?  We’re still negotiating.

OPHELIA	Oh, I thought you were someone else.

STEP-MOM	Darlin’, I am someone else.

JAMES	Okay.  I give up.  Who the fuck are you?

STEP-MOM	I’m here to see Karen…  Darling, it’s step-mommy dearest.

KAREN	(moaning)  Oh yeah.  Oh fuck.

GUILLERMO	Karen, we no do this.

KAREN	We have to, it’s our only chance.  If they catch you here before we consummate our marriage, you’ll be on the next plane back home.

GUILLERMO	It’s not right, no?  …

KAREN	Ahh…  There has to be something else we can do about this.

GUILLERMO	(something in Spanish ??, then…)  But it’s over.

STEP-MOM	Karen, how could you?

KAREN	Mom?  What are you doing here?

STEP-MOM	Can’t a concerned step-mother check up on her step-daughter?

KAREN	Yah, a concerned step-parent could, but you haven’t got a concerned bone in your body…  I can see there is one bone that you do want in your body…

INS LADY	No more games, Mr. Silver.  I have a job to do and I intend to do it.

FREDDY	See (light laugh), rabbits, I’m tellin’ ya.

INS LADY	People have tried to trick us before.  I can always tell if what I’m seeing is real.

INS LADY	Ah, Miss Hargrieves?  … Mm, sorry to bother you…

INS LADY	Alright.  I’m satisfied.

FREDDY	It looks like you’re not the only one.

INS LADY	What?

FREDDY	Nothing…
STEP-MOM	Does anyone have a cigarette?

GUILLERMO	It’s over now, yes?

OPHELIA	Why don’t we rent a movie?

JAMES	If it will shut you up for 2 minutes, anything.

OPHELIA	What about Lord Of The Ring?

JAMES	Naw, those little people scare me, for some reason.

OPHELIA	Aw, alright, what about The Ring?

JAMES	Ah, are you trying to get at something, here?

OPHELIA	What do you think?

JAMES	I think you know where I stand…  on big budget remakes of Japanese horror films…

OPHELIA	What about The Ring, Two?

KAREN	(sigh sound)  Well…  I guess this is good-bye.

GUILLERMO	Thank you.

KAREN	You were an awesome fake husband…

GUILLERMO	Adios, Karen…

STEP-MOM	Yoo hoo.  Hey, Sugar, do you need a ride, ‘cause I know I do…

FREDDY	Oh!  What happened to, ah, fako pretendo?

KAREN	Freddy, it’s not what you think.  

FREDDY	Oh, I heard enough, believe me.

KAREN	I didn’t do anything.

FREDDY	Another chap in my girl’s crotch, yeah, nice going.

KAREN	Ah, Freddy, I did not make love to Guillermo.

FREDDY	I know you didn’t make love to him.  You, you, you two fucked like rabbits, ya banged like a barn door in the wind.  You fucked his brains out.

KAREN	If you don’t believe me, then, then fine.  Think what you want.  Ya know what?  I did fuck him, Freddy, and he was the best lay of my life…  I’m sorry, Freddy.  I didn’t wanna get you involved in all this.  I never wanted to hurt you.

FREDDY	Ah, I’m not hurt.  You didn’t hurt me.

KAREN	You look hurt.

FREDDY	‘Cause I won’t shit right for a week…

KAREN	What?

FREDDY	I, I kept pushin’ about that cavity search thing.  I pushed to far…  if you know what I mean.

KAREN	(very light laugh)  Well…  how’s the most important organ?

FREDDY	My heart?

KAREN	Ah, no, I meant your penis, but…

FREDDY	Ah, both broken…

JOSE	So, you broke up, just because Karen had sex with her husband, who you knew nothin’ about, while you tried to cover for her and ended up with an INS agent’s hand up your ass?

FREDDY	Pretty much sums it up, yeah.

JOSE	Man, that’s rough.

FREDDY	Tell me about it.  No lube.  Nothing.

JOSE	I meant breaking up with the girl of your dreams.  But damn.  No lube?

FREDDY	Excuse me.  Could you help me find my puppy?  … Last time I saw him, he was in my pants…  Can I, can I buy you dinner, or do ya just want the money?  …  Have sex with me!

JOSE	(softly)  You’re a jack-ass, man.

JOHN	What’s up, sexy lady?

FREDDY	(very light laugh)

GIRL	How ‘bout a shower?  You can do my back.

JOHN	(very light laugh)  (SNORT)  Ah, I’ll do your back and your front.  (light laugh)

FREDDY	What does John Silverman have that I don’t?

LISA	Hey, have you seen Jose?  I had plans for him, tonight.

OPHELIA	No, nobody out there.  The minute somebody comes up, I’ll be ready.

LISA	Ready for what?  What’s… gonna happen?

OPHELIA	Streak week.

LISA	Oh, that’s right.  It starts tonight.  I heard the boys talkin’ about it.

OPHELIA	Same time every year.  I’m waitin’ to see some action.

LISA	Can I ask why?

OPHELIA	It’s for my thesis.  Social rituals of the silver-back gorilla.

LISA	Oh, the boys are substituting for the gorillas, I assume.

OPHELA	Gorillas pick fleas off of one another.  They swing from trees…  

LISA	(laughing – continuous)

OPHELIA	… They sling poop.  Frat boys aren’t quite so civilized…  It’s just until my grant comes through.  I’ll be in Borneo with the real thing.

LISA	I hate to break it to you, but I heard Dean Loward’s got everyone too scared to risk it…  He said if anyone streaks, it’s an automatic expulsion.

OPHELIA	Little killjoy.

LISA	Yeah, ya have to have real balls to go out there, tonight…

OPHELIA	Not necessarily…

LISA	Oh, no…  Oh, you’re looking in the wrong direction, missy.  I’m not doing it.

OPHELIA	Oh, c’mon.  Someone needs to break the ice.  The minute the first person streaks, everyone will be doing it.

LISA	No way!  I may be crazy, but I’m not insane.  What if campus security’s out there?  You know, waiting to pounce?

OPHELIA	But if I don’t get the data I need, I won’t finish my thesis.  I lose my chance at the grant…

LISA	I’m not doing it…  At lease, not on my own… (laughs)

GIRL	(laughing)

FREDDY	Okay.  He’s not rich, he’s not famous.  He’s not related to anyone who’s anyone, so what the fuck’s his secret?

GIRL	(light moaning – continuous)

JOHN	(laughing)

JOSE	I gotta get back.  Lisa had plans for me, tonight.

FREDDY	Dude, what’s more important than finding out why Silverman’s getting more ass than I am?

GIRL	(laughing, etc..)
JOSE	Love, commitment, partnership.

FREDDY	Jesus Christ, she keeps your balls in her handbag, doesn’t she?

JOSE	No, I got this vision thing.

GIRL	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

JOSE	Okay.  They’re done.  Let’s go…

JOHN	Oh, oh, great.  Oh, gravy.  Ah, ah…

GIRL	(moaning, etc. – continuous over dialog)

JOSE	‘Kay, dude, now.  Seriously, Lisa’s waiting for me.

FREDDY	A couple more minutes.  How much trouble could you get in?  …

GIRL	Is that it?

JOHN	Oh, sweetie.  I’m just getting started.

BOTH	(light laughing, moaning, etc. – continuous)

GIRL	Oh (???)

JOSE	(sort of a squeal)  What?

LISA/OPHELIA	(out of breath sounds)

OPHELIA	Ready?

LISA	Oh, I was born ready.  Okay, maybe not born ready, but, I’m ready now…  I think.  (screams/laughing)  I can’t believe I’m doing this!  I’m streaking!  (continuous screaming!!)

OPHELIA;	Oh, yeah!

STUDENTS	(cheering, etc.!!)

OPHELIA	(laughing)

LISA	Oh my god!  Okay, ya wanna go?!

OPHELIA	(laughing)  We need our coats back.

LISA	Oh, yeah!  (laughing)

OPHELIA	Ready?  ,,, Let’s go!!  (laughing)

LISA	(screaming)

STUDENTS	(cheering, etc.!!)

LISA	Oh!  I can’t believe we just did that.  (laughing)  Security!  Whatta we gonna do?!

OPHELIA	Run!!

LISA	(screaming!!)

JOHN	(light laugh)

GIRL	(giggles)

JOSE	Dude, what the hell are we doing?

FREDDY	Research…  Keep up.

LISA	Where’re we going?

OPHELIA	C’mon.  In there.

LISA	Locked…  Damn it.

OPHELIA/LISA	(light laughing)

LISA	I can’t believe the only office that’s open is the Dean’s office.

OPHELIA	Shh…

MAN	C’mon, they went this way…

LISA	(whisper)  Oh my god.

OPHELIA	I think he’s gone.

LISA	Holy shit, that was close.  (laughing)

OPHELIA	(laughing)  I know.

LISA	(breathless)  Ya know, I feel kinda…

OPHELIA	Alive?

LISA	No.

OPHELIA	(whisper)  What?

LISA	(whisper)  I feel kinda horny…

OPHELIA	Um, what’re we doing?

KISA	(light laughing)  Whatever we want.

BOTH	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

IN HALLWAY

GIRL	(moaning, etc.)

FREDDY	6 hours.  6 fucking hours…  How does he do that?

JOHN	Okay, so… okay!  So, I’ll see you when I see you.

GIRL	Can I call you?

JOHN	(high voice)  Ah, oh… yes…

JOSE	I wasn’t watching the (can’t understand??)  …

OPHELIA/LISA	(laughing – continuous)

LISA	I can’t believe we just did that.

OPHELIA	What happened in the Dean’s office, stays in the Dean’s office, right?

LISA	Agreed…  Just between you and me.

OPHELIA	Absolutely.

BOTH	(light laughing)

JAMES	Oh…

OPHELIA	Lisa and I made out.

JAMES	I’m sorry, what?

OPHELIA	We streaked…  Last night, Lisa and I, we ended up hiding out in the Dean’s office, of all places, and one thing led to another and we made out!

JAMES	Oh my god!  Are you serious?  So, like, you and Lisa, like ‘ehhh?’  Oh my god, that’s fucking epic!  So, that would totally explain the cat ate the canary look on your face.

OPHELIA	(light laugh)  Well, I did get me some pussy, that’s for sure.

JAMES	Oh, god.  (deep breath sigh)

OPHELIA	You’re up early.

JAMES	Oh, yeah, I’m, I’m up, alright.  Oh my god, I would love to see that tape.

OPHELIA	What?  What tape?

JAMES	The Dean’s office.  He has a security camera.

OPHELIA	You’re kidding, right?  Tell me you’re kidding.

JAMES	No, Ophelia.  That’s how he knew it was me, who had sex with his chair.  Remember?

OPHELIA	I’m so fucked.

JOHN	And a hammer of four  (???)  What is the meaning of this?

KAREN	Are you ready for me?

JOHN	(nerdy laugh)

JOSE	Dude, can we go home?  Lisa’s gonna kill me as it is…

OPHELIA	So where does he keep the tapes?

JAMES	Jeez, I don’t know.  Let me look at my map of Dean Loward’s secret hiding places.

OPHELIA	Not funny, James.  Help me look.

JAMES	Um…  okay, I’m gonna go in there…  Okay, if I was a tape with 2 hot chicks on it, where would I be?  …

DEAN	(can’t understand/hear)

NANCY	… my own father?

DEAN	Not now Nancy Regan…  Hey…  Tyler!!!

FREDDY	Higher.  Higher.  Oh my god, higher.  (struggle sounds)

FREDDY	Karen?

KAREN	… Freddy, what the hell?

FREDDY	Oh, god…

DEAN	I oughta sign your expulsion papers right now.

JAMES	Oh, c’mon.  You’d kick an emotionally scarred student outta college, just because he saw the Dean doin’ something to someone and that someone bein’ unable to walk for a week?

DEAN	Enough of that!  I thought we had a deal.

JAMES	Now.  Who’s this naughty little minx?

DEAN	You stay away from my daughter, you hear me?

JAMES	My, my.  The love child of that special someone who stole your heart, and your wallet.

DEAN	Get out!

JAMES	Me and your pops, we go way back.

NANCY	He’s told me all about you.  He has an ulcer named after you.

JAMES	No.  You, that (very light laugh), that is so sweet.  No.

DEAN	Yes…  Hold on…  Alright, the both of you, out of my office.  I gotta take this.  Nancy, you wait right outside that door.

JAMES	Ya know, ya know, I could baby-sit her for you.  5 dollars an hour sound reasonable?  (very light laugh)  Ah…

DEAN	Keep your filthy paws away from her…  Get out!  …

OPHELIA	Ah, am I bad?  Ah, I thought this was my dorm room.  I must lay off the booze.

LACEY	Um.  Seems like you’ve made that mistake before…

OPHELIA	I don’t know what to say…  except, the camera really does add 10 pounds.

LACEY	Ah, I think you look great.

OPHELIA	Thanks, I think.  You’re not gonna tell the Dean about this, right?

LACEY	No.  Now why would I do that?

OPHELIA	thanks.  I…  Oh, you won’t?

LACEY	Oh, I think I’ll take that one, now.

NANCY	So, are you as bad as my dad says you are?

JAMES	(light laugh)  Well, I don’t know.  How bad do you think I am?

NANCY	Well, if I told you, I might be awfully disappointed.

JAMES	(very light laugh)  Well, you wouldn’t be the first.

NANCY	Mm, mm.

JAMES	Whoa, whoa, Nancy Reagan.  What are you doing?

NANCY	I’m tryin’ to get me a piece of that bad boy ass.  (very light laugh)

JAMES	Oh, no…

KAREN	Where do you get off following me?

FREDDY	I wasn’t following you.  I was following him.

JOHN	It happens.  Jealousy’s a bitch.

FREDDY	You little prick.

JOHN	Actually, it’s point 2, 2 meters metric.

FREDDY	I can’t believe this.  First your fake Mexican husband and now, now this chess club bitch.

JOHN	Chess club is an awesome place to score…

KAREN	Hey, would you just listen to me?  I did not have sex with Guillermo!  I’m not going to have sex with John Silverman.

FREDDY	You didn’t?  You’re not?

JOHN	You’re not?

KAREN	No.  It was my step-monster.  She dropped by to check up on me and her and Guillermo, they have history, so when she saw him she jumped his bones.  I swear.  Hand over heart.

FREDDY	Well, what about this dweeb?  Why are you here at 7 in the morning?

KAREN	John is helping you with your little problem.

FREDDY	She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.  My problem’s as big as a baby’s arm.

KAREN	I bought you a vile of John’s love juice.

JOHN	Potassium bioexnate hydroxide.  One hit of this and your (** phonetic fake scientific words???)  cupric avranosa will keep your irresistible as a plasines dyiay…  You’ll fuck like rabbits.

JOSE	So that’s your secret?  That’s why you have so many girls?

JOHN	Ha.  Actually, I get a lot of pussy, because I have an abnormally large wang.

KAREN	He’s right.  They don’t call him Long John Silverman for nothing.

JOSE	C’mon.  Like size matters that much…  Okay, then.

JOHN	Enough said.

OPHELIA	(very light nervous laugh)  Ah, look, Lacey.  I, I think you’re a very sweet girl and everything, but that’s not the same thing…

LACEY	Um, doesn’t have to be.

JAMES	Um, hey, what, what are you doing?  What?  …  Nancy Reagan, I don’t think it’s a good idea.

OPHELIA	Ah!

JAMES	What?

NANCY	Lacey?

JAMES	Ophelia!

OPHELIA	This isn’t what it looks like.

JAMES	Oh…  neither, neither is this.  We were just out there and she attacked me.

LACEY	Yeah, she likes to do that.

NANCY	Mm.  You’re no angel, either…

GIRLS	(moaning, yeah’s, etc. – continuous)

LACEY	Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck…

GIRLS	(moaning, yes’s, fuck’s, etc. – continuous)

FREDDY	What if it’s poisoness?

KAREN	What if it’s not?

FREDDY	What if it doesn’t work?

KAREN	What if it does work? …

FREDDY	I don’t think I’m gonna need this, anymore…

KAREN	(moaning, etc. – continuous)  …  Mm, John Silverman’s got nothing on you…

OPHELIA	This is it.  It all comes down to this, the final interview.  Don’t blow it, now.

DEAN	And what makes you think you deserve this grant?!

OPHELIA	I, um…

PROFESSOR	And what makes you think that traveling to Borneo is good for your research?!

OPHELIA	Well, I guess (clears throat)… (V.O.) Keep calm.  You can do this…  Fuck!!  It’s a dream.  You’re dreaming.  This isn’t real.

OPHELIA	Might as well make the best of it…

OPHELIA	Right on cue.

GORILLAS	(gorilla sounds)

OPHELIA	This is what I’m talkin’ about.  This is my kinda interview…  Fuck the grant…

OPHELIA	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(yeah’s, breath sounds, moaning, etc. – continuous)

DEAN	Miss (??? last name ??)  Ophelia!  …  Ophelia!

PROFESSOR/DEAN	Wake up!!	

OPHELIA	Ah…  I’m so sorry.  I’ve been so worried about this interview, I haven’t slept in days.

DEAN	So you think you can nap between questions?

OPHELIA	I guess I didn’t get the grant.

DEAN	Let me show you the door…

OPHELIA	Oh!!

JAMES	Whoa…  What happened?

OPHELIA	Why’d you smack Professor Lasky in front of the Dean?

JAMES	(light laughing)  Okay.  Well, I’m glad you added the ‘in front of the Dean,’ bit, ‘cause nothing’s keeping me from getting’ that Lasky’s ass when Loward’s not lookin’.  I get, ya know, all moist down there just thinkin’ about the moment his dentures pop out.  What a sex fiend.  Mm… mm…

OPHELIA	I gotta go.  My grant interview’s in 10 minutes.

JAMES	Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, give me 9 and I’ll relax you.

OPHELIA	Does that include 7 minutes of apologizing, saying it’s never happened to you, before?

JAMES	In a minute and a half of foreplay.

OPHELIA	I’ve gotta go.

JAMES	(sigh)  Please don’t get it.

JOSE	(loud breath sound)

OPHELIA	(very light laugh)  Save something for the party, tonight.

LISA	Are you ready for round 12?

JOSE	Lisa, I don’t know if I can.

LISA	At the end of the semester, we’re not gonna see each other for 6 weeks.  Ahh…  I gotta stock up, now.  C’mon…

LISA	Ah, I’m gonna miss your lips…  I’m gonna miss your hands…  Mm and I’m gonna miss fucking your brains out.

JOSE	Ah, ah, I don’t have anymore brains left.

LISA	(light laugh)

LISA	(moaning, light laughing, etc. – continuous)  … Jose…  (continuous moaning)

KAREN	You sure you don’t want me to try and reclaim some of your porn stash from Lisa?

FREDDY	I’m a reformed character.

KAREN	Weeks on the boat with the guys, no way to relieve the tension.  You sure you’re gonna make it?

FREDDY	I can do it.  I think I can do it.

KAREN	That’s what I thought…  I got ya something!

FREDDY	Oh.  (laughs)…  (laughs)  Oh, yes.

KAREN	So, do I win girlfriend of the year award, or what?

FREDDY	Why don’t you come with?  Ya know, to ease my burden?

KAREN	Ya know I can’t.  The parental units are coming to pick me up, after the party, tonight.  And my step-monster got the whole summer planned in the Hamptons.

FREDDY	Fuck her.

KAREN	Everyone else has.

FREDDY	I’ll let you hold my pole…  I meant my fishing pole, but, while you’re down there.

KAREN	(very light laugh)

JAMES	Hey, James Tyler…  Cool.  Yeah, is it ready? …  Alright, I need it for tonight…  Good.  Alright, I’m on my way…

SUSAN	Think you’ll find it worth the wait…

JAMES	C’mon…  Pick up.  Pick up…  Pick up, pick up, pick up!

OPHELIA	(phone V.O.)  Hi, you’ve reached Ophelia’s phone.  Leave me a message…

JAMES	Hi, it’s me, again.  For the 25th time.  Where the hell are you?  The meeting’s been over for hours…

SUSAN	Hey, there.  It’s been a while.  How’re you been?

JAMES	Great.

SUSAN	How’s Ophelia?

JAMES	Good.

SUSAN	(** she talks very fast and music/noise – hard to understand)  So, Jose must have missed me, huh?  He sent me a ticket to come and see him… Okay, well, it’s been an emotional catching up and all, but I’m gonna get going and let you stare off in the distance, some more.

JAMES	Thanks…  Get your fine ass back here.  I got somethin’ to show you.  Before you think it, it’s not just my cock…

GIRL	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

OPHELIA	(light crying) …

LISA	To our first term.

KAREN	I’ll drink to that.  (light laugh) …

BOTH	(oh’s)

LISA	Wow.

KAREN	(light laugh)  When we all moved in, I never thought I’d end up in love with that fat head.  (light laugh)

LISA	Mm…

KAREN	Lisa.  Slow down.  (laughs)

LISA	Mm…  You said ‘I never…’

KAREN	The game is called, ‘I never.’  Is everyone in?

LISA	Um, well, I’ve never had sex.

JAMES	That’s an easy one.

FREDDY	(light laugh)

LISA	(laughing)  Oh my god.

LISA	Badger poison…  What the hell was I thinking?

JAMES	Okay.  The next person that walks into this room, better be Ophelia.

JAMES	… Fuck stick!

DAD	Excuse me, young man, what did you just call me?

STEP-MOM	(laughs)  I think he called you a fuck stick.

DAD	Find Karen.  We’re leaving.

STEP-MOM	(imitating)  Find Karen.  We’re leaving.

DAD	You’re drunk.

STEP-MOM	(laughs)  And you’re ugly, but tomorrow I’ll be sober.

DAD	Right.  Not for long.

STEP-MOM	(light laugh)

JOSE	… Hang on.  Give me a minute…  I got an idea…  I little trip, down memory lane.

JOSE	Come in…  For old time’s sake…  I’ll never forget that night.  You were so beautiful…  So sexy…  (too low, music too loud???)  … Are you gonna think of me everyday at Bible Camp?  …  Oh, Lisa…

SUSAN	Lisa?

JOSE	Susan?

SUSAN	What’s going on and who’s Lisa?

JOSE	What, what are you doing here?

SUSAN	Well, I don’t know the technical term, but I think it’s page 73 of the Kama Sutra.  

JOSE	But I thought you were in Alaska.

SUSAN	I was, until you sent me the plane ticket.

JOSE	I did?

LISA	Has little Jose recovered?

JOSE	Ah, give me a minute!  Please, hide, hide under the bed.  Hide under the bed, please!

SUSAN	Are you fucking with me?  What’s going on?

JOSE	I was, but it was an accident.  Please, I’m begging you.  Hide under the bed.

SUSAN	Why did you have me come here if you have a girlfriend?

JOSE	I didn’t.  Someone’s fuckin with me.  Please.

SUSAN	Yeah.  I was, but…

LISA	We only have another 457 minutes left before we have to leave.  I wanna spend every one of them in your arms.  (light laughing)  …  And here you come…

CHIP	(drunk sounding)  No hard feelings.  No hard feelings…

FREDDY	Man, I know what you heard, man, but there’s nothing wrong with my junk.

CHIP/ROBBIE	(light laughing)

ROBBIE	He’s offering you his little olive branch.

CHIP	Yeah.

FREDDY	Hey, I got my own olive branch, alright, and it ain’t so little.

ROBBIE	Whatever.

CHIP	An Alpha Beta man takes what he wants.  There’s no pussy-footing around.

FREDDY	Hey, he’s got the ‘no pussy’ part right.

ROBBIE	(very light laugh)  You haven’t seen the Chipster in action.

FREDDY	No, I saw Karen’s dog use his balls as a chew toy.

CHIP	Not cool.

ROBBIE	No.  Chips a palace ‘cause he’s an Alpha Beta man.  (not sure about that???)

FREDDY	Is that right?

ROBBIE	That’s absolutely right.

CHIP	Next girl through that door, I swear on my life, I will tap that ass.

FREDDY	(laughs)  I can’t wait to see that one…  Miss Hargrieves, looking for Guillermo?

KAREN	Get your sick balls…

DAD	Baby, what is the meaning of this?

KAREN	Whoops.

DAD	Sick balls?

KAREN	I taught him that, for protection, for watching an innocent girl away from home for the first time.

DAD	That’s my little girl.

KAREN	Do we have to go, now?

DAD	The jet’s waiting.

KAREN	(sighs)  There’s someone I have to say good-bye to.

DAD	Ah, time is money.

KAREN	There are more important things…

DAD	Like what?

LISA	Help me out, Jose.

JOSE	I’m outta gas.

SUSAN	Ow!!  …

JOSE	(high pitched voice)  Ow! …

SUSAN	I can explain.

JOSE	It, it, it was an accident…

LISA	You made it.

SUSAN	I hate to say it, but I think someone’s fucking with us.

LISA	I am…  At least, I hope to.  … I sent the tickets.

JOSE	You did… But why?

LISA	Because for the next 6 weeks, my sex life’s going into hibernation.  I wanna go with a bang…  A big bang.  Whatta ya say?

JOSE	Okay.

DAD	What kinda school is this, anyway?

KAREN	…  Dad, wait.

CHIP	So, ah (clears throat)  you come here, often?

STEP-MOM	You ever been in love, Chip?

CHIP	(drunk sounding)  Yeah, um, I love my parents.  Oh, I mean, I mean (light laugh), I mean, not that I have sex with my parents.  But, I, I would have sex with someone as old as my parents, I mean, when you really think about it, they’re at their sexual peak.  Um, I don’t wanna think about that.

STEP-MOM	You ever been in love with a woman you couldn’t have?

CHIP	(clears throat)  I mean, sure, lots of times.  I mean, I mean, who hasn’t, right?

STEP-MOM	The heart wants what the heart wants.

CHIP	(clears throat)  Um, I’m a virgin.

STEP-MOM	Mm, and I’m drunk.  And in the morning, I will be sober and you will be a stud.

Karen	Freddy?  There’s someone I want you to meet.

ROBBIE	Ya gotta hear this.

KAREN	This is important…  Freddy, I’d like you to meet my father.  Daddy, this is Freddy.

FREDDY	Pleasure to meet you, Sir.  (very light laugh)

DAD	I’m spending $2000 an hour to keep a jet on stand-by while you drag me up here to meet this clown?

KAREN	This clown is my boyfriend…  And, the jet doesn’t have to wait anymore, because I’m not going.

DAD	What?

KAREN	He wants me to hold his pole.

FREDDY	Oh!  Fishing pole.

KAREN	I’m staying here with him.

ROBBIE	He’s gonna bang that “MILTF.”

DAD	What the hell is a “MILTF?”

FREDDY	“A mother I’d like to fuck.”!

DAD	whoa!

KAREN	Dad…

KAREN	Dad, don’t.

CHIP	Who do you think you are?

STEP-MOM	Yeah, who do you think you are?

KAREN	Mom?!

DAD	Killer…

CHIP	Whoa, whoa…

DAD	Sick, balls!

CHIP	Whoa, whoa, no!!

CHIP	(screaming)  Okay… okay…

OPHELIA	I never thought I’d see James Tyler sitting out a party…

JAMES	Where have you been?

OPHELIA	Needed some time to think.

JAMES	Okay, so, how’d it go?

JAMES	The interview?

OPHELIA	It was a disaster.

JAMES	Baby…  Oh, baby, they’ll be other grants.  Okay?  Other research trips.

OPHELIA	No, there won’t.

JAMES	Look, I got something to show you.  Okay?  Before you think it, it’s not just a…

OPHELIA	I have something, I have something to show you, too.

JAMES	Okay…  What’s this?

OPHELIA	It’s my itinerary.  I got the grant…  I’m leaving tonight.

JAMES	…  That’s great…  That’s great…  I’m happy for you…  You deserve it.

OPHELIA	Be careful what you wish for.  Isn’t that what they say?  … This is everything I ever wanted, but, now I don’t know.  The thought of leaving you…  But maybe I should just ell them…

JAMES	No.  C’mon, are you crazy?  You have to go.  You’ve worked too hard to give it up.

OPHELIA	I know, but…

JAMES	Ahh…  I’m so proud of you…

OPHELIA	So, what did you want to show me?

JAMES	Oh, it’s nothing.  Forget it.  (clears throat)  Look, there’s (clears throat) there’s this dare-diving contest that I’m judging, so, gotta go…  (sighs)

NANCY	Hey…  I wanted to, um, ask you a favor.

JAMES	Nancy Reagan…  I’m not really into…

NANCY	Are you okay?

JAMES	(deep sigh)  No.  Far from okay…  Ah…  (shake head sound)  Whaa…  (blows out air)  Whatta ya want?

NANCY	Well, I kinda wanted to ask you a favor, more from my father, really.  Ya see, I wanted to see if there was any way that I could get that tape, you know, the one with the thing with… the thing?  (very light laugh)

JAMES	Your father, the Dean, has got my expulsion papers signed and ready to go.  Without that tape…  I’m so outta here…

NANCY	Well, are you sure there isn’t anything I could do to get it?

NANCY	She’s leaving?

JAMES	Without any regrets.
NANCY	Now, whatta I have to do to earn that tape?

JAMES	You already have…  Here…

NANCY	That’s all you wanted, for her to leave?

JAMES	She was already leaving.  Just didn’t want her lookin’ back all the time.  (breath sound)

DRIVER	Tough sayin’ good-bye, huh?

OPHELIA	No, he made it easy…

KAREN	Ya headin’ out on us?

OPHELIA	Thought it would be better, no teary eyed good-byes.

LISA	Yeah. That’s not gonna happen.

FREDDY	Whatta ‘bout James?  Shouldn’t he be here?

OPHELIA	No.  He’s made his choice.  I’ve made mine.

JOSE	Take care, huh?

OPHELIA	You too.

KAREN	Send us pictures, okay?  Come back to visit us.

FREDDY	Hey, yo better send me some pictures of some girls.  (light laugh)

OPHELIA	Okay.  Bye, Freddy.  I’ll write…

KAREN	I love you.

FREDDY	Bye…  I wanna meet some girls, hey…
