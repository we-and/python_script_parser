ELAHE VO		It's night.

ELAHE	VO		Everyone, close your eyes.

ELAHE VO		Mafia…open your eyes. Mafia…kill someone. Mafia…close your eyes. Doctor…open your eyes. Doctor…save someone.

ELAHE	VO		Doctor…close your eyes.

ELAHE	VO		It's morning. Wake up. Last night, the Mafia killed someone.

ELAHE	VO		The Doctor didn't guess correctly. And who was killed… Sara.

SARA	VO		Aww! Come on, Doctor!

BABAK	VO		Bye.

ALL	VO		[laughing]

ELAHE	VO		Let's take a vote. Who says, Babak?

BABAK	VO		Look at her. She's delighted. Okay.

ELAHE VO		Who thinks, it's Mohsen?

NEDA	VO		You're making a mistake. Raise your hand.

FARHAD VO		No.

NEDA	VO		You'll see.

ELAHE	VO		Who thinks, it's Farhad? Who thinks, it's Neda?

NEDA	VO		Come on.

ELAHE	VO		Neda, defend yourself.

NEDA VO		You're making a mistake. One of you guys is a citizen. You're making me out to be the Mafia. You're letting them win.

ELAHE	VO		Anyone buy that?

NEDA	VO		Thank you very much.

ELAHE	VO		Sorry Neda. You've been condemned to death. Your last words.

NEDA VO		My last words?

ELAHE	VO		Yeah.

NEDA	VO		Babak, look after our baby? I lost the game.

BABAK VO		It's just a game, sweetheart. Don't worry about Shabnam. I'll find her a sweet mommy.

NEDA	VO		My ghost will find you and pluck your eyes out.

BABAK	VO		You're giving me goosebumps.

NEDA	VO		Not funny.

ELAHE	VO		The Mafia is the winner. Neda and Sara were both citizens.

FARHAD VO		No!

ELAHE VO		Yes.

NEDA	VO		See, I told you.

FARHAD VO		But you two are so good at lying. It's hard to believe a word you say.

SARA VO		Who was it then?

NEDA	VO		Obviously it was, Babak.

ELAHE	VO		Babak and Mohsen.

SARA VO		I told Farhad but he's too stubborn.

FARHAD VO		Come on. Let's get some shots. Forget this. Where did you put it?

BABAK	VO		It's in the freezer. Neda, check on Shabnam. Make sure she's not up.

NEDA	VO		She's asleep. The monitor is in my pocket.

MOHSEN VO		I guess I'll get the barbecue ready.

BABAK	VO		I know this brand. It doesn't sit well.

FARHAD VO		You'll be fine, give it up.

BABAK	VO		Makes me throw up. Where are your glasses?

FARHAD VO		Ladies. Who's up for a shot?

NEDA VO		I'm breastfeeding.

FARHAD VO		It's good for you. It'll keep the baby asleep all night.

ELAHE	VO		He's crazy.

FARHAD VO		Want one?

SARA VO		I'll take one.

FARHAD VO		Anyone else?

ELAHE	VO		You know Mohsen and I don't drink.

FARHAD VO		You guys are party poopers. So it's you, me and a little for Sara.

NEDA VO		Don't go overboard and get drunk.

FARHAD VO		Don't be like that.

BABAK	VO		Just a couple shots for my toothache.

NEDA VO		I'm serious. I don't want to deal with it. Just take it easy.

SARA VO		We need someone to take care of you!

FARHAD VO		Where are the kids sleeping?

BABAK	VO		They're in the room with Shabnam.

KIDS			[laugh and chatter]

SHABNAM		[gurgling with delight]

BABAK VO		Guys. Come on out. What are you doing? Come on, she's awake. Don't wake her up. Let her sleep.

FARHAD VO		Is she awake?

SHABNAM		[cooing]

BABAK			[shushing the baby]

BABAK VO		Sweetheart. My pretty girl. Sleep. Sleep my love. What is it? What happened? Why are you looking at me like that? Sleep. Sleep, sweetheart.

NEDA VO		Maryam. Open your eyes. Look at me, call me. It's daytime. The sun is out…

ELAHE VO		Maryam. Open your eyes. [singing] Look at me, call me. It's daytime. The sun is out…

NEDA VO		We have to learn this before we can teach you.

ELAHE			You have to learn it. Yes. We have to learn it.

NEDA VO		Do these.

SARA			Thanks.

NEDA VO		Welcome.

SARA VO		Like this?

ELAHE VO		No. Put it through the middle.

NEDA VO		You've never done this before?

SARA VO		Like this.

NEDA VO		Yes, that's better.

SARA VO		I'm learning a little bit.

NEDA VO		Well done.

SARA			You know, last week, For the first time, I made gormeh sabzee.

NEDA			Oh!

SARA			And Farhad was very impressed.

NEDA VO		Bravo.

ELAHE			Very nice.

SARA VO		Thanks.

ELAHE VO		Have you guys decided on a second baby?
SARA VO		One is enough.

ELAHE VO		When Barbod grows a little, I'll have my second.

SARA VO		That's a handful.

ELAHE VO 		An only child becomes spoiled.

ELAHE: [in Farsi]	I don't want him to be alone. It's not fair.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	I wouldn't mind another one. But it's really hard. Just one has been a struggle.

SARA: [in Farsi]	Shabnam's a good baby.

SARA: [in English}	What would you do if you had a boy?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Shabnam is a quiet child. We're the ones who are on edge.

ELAHE: [in Farsi]	It was good you waited before you had her.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Why?

ELAHE: [in Farsi]	You were alone in Iran while Babak was here. It would have been difficult.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	That's true. Yes?

SARA: [in Farsi]	Can I get a skewer?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Yes, dear. Oh! Oh! Oh!

ELAHE: [in Farsi]	What is it?

SARA: 			[gasps]

NEDA: [in Farsi]	I just got it today.

SARA: [in English]	Look at you!

ELAHE: [in Farsi]	I didn't know you got a tattoo.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	I wanted the swelling to go down first.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Do you like it?

SARA: [in Farsi]	Yes.

SARA: [in Farsi]	Does Babak like it?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	The other half is on his arm.

ELAHE: [in Farsi]	How fancy.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	I know. I wanted one like yours.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	When we both decided to get it, I put it here.

ELAHE: [in Farsi]	What is it?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	I really don't know. It was in the tattoo artist's book.

ELAHE: [in Farsi]	You don't know? You're special.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Well, it's very unique.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	[grunts in pain]

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	What is it?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	[grunts] This toothache's been killing me all night.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	I could have brought you something from the hospital.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	It came on so suddenly.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Have you quit?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Sort of. Neda's sensitive to it. She's asthmatic. I don't smoke in the house.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Neda okay? Is she settled?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	We got into it again. She's homesick. She's trying to like it here, for Shabnam's sake.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Are you two happy?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	She's happy, and I'm happy.

FARHAD: [in English]	That's good.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	You're hardly around these days, Doctor.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Since I was transferred to emergency… …my job has become difficult.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	How hard could it be? You stick people with needles.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	What do you know?

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Ever been in a situation… …where someone is brought to the ER under your watch. As hard as you try to save them… …there is no way. This morning, a young girl came in at 3:00 a.m. She was my last patient.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Did you know her?

FARHAD: 		[starts to speak]

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Babak…

BABAK: 		[coughing from smoke]

NEDA: [in Farsi]	You two are at it again? Mohsen says dinner is ready.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Okay. Come on. Let's go have dinner. Guys, it's freezing. Don't come out.

MOHSEN: [in Farsi]	Spend the night.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I know, but it's better we get back.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Thanks for everything.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Mohsen, thank you. We had a great time.

MOHSEN: [in Farsi]	My pleasure.

BABAK: [in English]	Sara, continue Farsi. You're so good.

SARA: [in Farsi]	Thank you so much.

MOHSEN: [in Farsi]	Bye, Elahe.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Take this too, thank you.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	You okay?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Yeah.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	I'll get it for you.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	You didn't finish your story.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	It's nothing, nevermind.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I told you a hundred times. Say it all, or don't mention it at all.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	I wanted to say something but didn't want it to ruin our night.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Talk later.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Take care of yourself. We'll talk later.

NEDA:			Farhad, it's been our pleasure.

FARHAD:		Likewise. It was a great evening.

NEDA:			Good night dear, thank you. I'll drive.

BABAK:		Why?

NEDA:			You want to drive like this?

BABAK:		Why not?

NEDA:			Because you're drunk. Give it to me.

BABAK:		Better than having a suspended license. Get in.

NEDA:			Don't start, Babak.

BABAK:		Come on, the baby is going to wake up. [car engine revving]

NEDA: [in Farsi]	What was Farhad talking about?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What's your deal with Farhad?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	You're both the same.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	You know how he is. He didn't look well. I asked, but he said nothing.

BABAK: [into phone]	Hello, Mohsen. Yes, brother? Forget it. Nothing I can do now. No, I'll get it when I see you. Okay. Thanks, it was a fun night. Bye.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	What did he say?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I left my phone charger.


NEDA: [in Farsi]	Good you don't leave yourself behind. Let's head back and sleep there.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I said we wouldn't stay. I won't go back. I want to sleep in my own bed.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Are you paying attention?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What is it doing? It's going crazy. It says to turn right.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Go straight.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Wait, let's see where it's saying to go.

SHABNAM:		[begins to cry]

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Be careful!

SHABNAM:		[crying]

NEDA: [in Farsi]	You woke the baby.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Move your hand, I want to go backwards.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	What for? You can't…

BABAK: [in Farsi]	There's no U-turn ahead.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	You can't reverse. Go straight.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Stop talking.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Oh, god.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	It's acting crazy.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Keep your eyes on the road. There's something on the road. Be careful! You ran it over.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What are you talking about?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Just look where you're going! Don't drink if you can't handle it. You know how to ruin the night.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	You nag too much.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Why are you sitting? Go check.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What? Go check what?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Go see what you did.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What have I done? It's just a cat, so what? Why is everything such an issue?

SHABNAM:		[fussing and crying]

NEDA:			[shushing the baby] What happened?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Nothing.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	What do you mean, 'nothing'?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Nothing happened.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	What was that sound, then?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Take a look for yourself if you don't believe me.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Give me Shabnam's bag. Hi, baby. Sweetheart. Throw this in the trash.

BABAK:		[coughs, dry heaves]

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Come on. Please let me drive.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Will you stop? What difference does it make?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	We should go back to Mohsen's house.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I said we're not going back, so why should I go back?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	You're so stubborn. You won't let me drive… you won't go back. I don't want you to drive. You're not well.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What's wrong with me?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	You don't pay attention.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	If you have it all figured out, why did you lose your license to the police? What does that have to do with it? I didn't have my insurance. Let go of getting behind the wheel. 'My license wasn't with me.' Just leave it. You tell me, what we should do? Tell me…

NEDA: [in Farsi]	You reject everything I say.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	You tell us what to do, my love.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	I don't know. Let's go to a hotel.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	For a half hour drive?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Half an hour ago you said, 'half an hour.' We've been driving around in circles for two hours. Think of the poor baby. Where are you going?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	You said go to a hotel. So let's go. What can I do?

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Do whatever you want.

INSERT			HOTEL NORMANDIE

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Is this it?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Yes.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Don't you want to go to a more crowded one?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	This was the closest one. It doesn't make a difference.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Give me my sweatshirt. In the back.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Wait. Let's go together.

NEDA: [in Farsi]	Bring Shabnam's bag.

BABAK: [in English]	Hey! Stay back! What are you doing?

Las Vegas in the Hotel Bellagio… I was here last week when that…that little African American boy was shot…and killed. And the Ghost fire… …where the warehouse… burned 40 people to death, in front of my eyes. Oh yes, I've seen a lot of death. All sorts of it. But the worst… …the worst… …is the death of a child. That is very painful. Sometimes there's just no way out. Hmm. You know, it's like…it's like quicksand…the more you struggle… …the deeper you get in. Oh… I'm terribly sorry if my words disturbed you. Have a peaceful night.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I didn't take this picture of Shabnam.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	You think I'm an idiot? I wouldn't forget taking a picture of Shabnam with my flash.

BABAK: [in English]	I don't know. Okay… the first time, I was in the lobby. A woman came. When I went back…she was gone.

OFFICER		I don't understand.

BABAK: [in English]	I mean… There was someone in the lobby, but… …they… …they disappeared.

OFFICER		They vanished?

BABAK: [in English]	I don't know…maybe. And second time… There was a woman in our room right there.

OFFICER		The same one that vanished?

BABAK: [in English]	I didn't see her…the second time. There was a woman in our room right there.

OFFICER		The same one that vanished?

BABAK: [in English]	I didn’t see her…the second time.

OFFICER		Can you confirm this?

NEDA: [in English]	I’m not…sure.

OFFICER 		Are you sure you weren’t imagining this?

BABAK: [in English]	No, it happened twice.

OFFICER 		Are you taking anything?

BABAK: [in English]	Like what?

OFFICER 		Just answer the question! Yes or no?

BABAK: [in English]	Of course not, I… …I don’t do drugs.

OFFICER 		What’s the smell on your breath?

BABAK: [in English]	It’s just my…mouthwash. It has alcohol in it, you know? I have a…toothache.

OFFICER 		Is there something that you’re not telling me?

BABAK: [in English]	No. Ask my wife. Someone was making noise… on the roof. Someone’s been… knocking on the door.

OFFICER 		Did you see them?

BABAK: [in English]	No, there was no one there.

OFFICER 		Look, it’s five in the morning… and you want me to find somebody knocking on your door… who ran away…in a hotel?

BABAK: [in English]	They didn’t run away.

OFFICER 		They vanished too?

BABAK: [in English]	You came all this way to make fun of me?

OFFICER 		No. I’m not making fun of you, you’re the one that’s fooling me…I’m done.

NEDA: [in English]	Please…sir …it's…long night. Babak, stay calm. Don’t get mad.

BABAK: [in English]	Okay, I’m sorry. My wife is right. Before you came, we heard a child calling his mother from the bedroom.

OFFICER 		Yeah? She…she…she heard it.

NEDA: [in English]	Yes. True.

OFFICER 		So, what about the child?

BABAK: [in English]	The child wasn’t there.

OFFICER 		Let me get this straight…just like all the others… May I?

NEDA: [in English]	Sure.

SHABNAM:		[cooing]

NEDA:			[softly] Yes, my love. Sweetheart.

OFFICER 		So this is your only child?

NEDA: [in English]	Yes.

OFFICER		I thought you had another…

NEDA: [in English]	What do you mean?

OFFICER 	You said a child called out to you… …but I can see that your daughter is…just a baby.

NEDA: [in English]		No, he didn’t call me…he just said ‘mommy’.
BABAK: [in English]		Excuse me sir. It seems you didn’t understand exactly.

OFFICER 	No, I understood completely. You said you heard sounds. You said you saw people disturbing you. But they’re not here now. This isn’t a police matter. You guys need to find yourself a ghost hunter.

NEDA: [in English]		Ghost?

OFFICER 			Yeah… If he can catch it… and doesn’t scam you.

BABAK: [in English]		Are you messing with us?

OFFICER 	No. I’m not kidding. We deal in facts…things we can see. Not hallucinations.

BABAK: [in English]	But I’m telling the truth.

OFFICER		Your baby’s beautiful. May I hold her?

NEDA: [in English]	Yes. Come, my love.

OFFICER		Thank you. Oh… she’s adorable.

NEDA: [in English]	Yes.

OFFICER		Yeah. Take care of her.

NEDA: [in English]	Uh… do you have children?

OFFICER		I did…a daughter.

NEDA: [in English]	Why…why…why do you mean ‘did’?

OFFICER		She was run over by a car.

NEDA: [in English]	I’m sorry.

SHABNAM:		[babbling]

OFFICER		Who’s that?

BABAK: [in English]	I don’t know…

OFFICER		It’s probably my partner. Let him in.

SHABNAM:		[crying]
NEDA: [in Farsi]	Wasn’t he just here?

BABAK			Neda!

NEDA			Babak? What happened? What…

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What do you want me to do?

NEDA: [in Farsi] 	I don't know, call someone.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Who?

NEDA: [in Farsi] 	I don't know… Farhad… Mohsen.

SHABNAM:		[whimpering]

NEDA:			[shushing the baby]

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Hello… Hello, Farhad. Hello, Farhad, how are you? Farhad, sorry. I know it’s 5:00 a.m. We came to a hotel… Hello… Hello… Farhad! Damn it!

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Babak…
BABAK: [in Farsi]	Farhad, we need help.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Babak…

BABAK: [in Farsi] 	Hello… do you hear me?

FARHAD: [in Farsi] 	It didn't ring… and you didn't answer Neda's phone.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I don’t know where my phone is. Maybe I left it in the car. I think Neda’s phone is in the car. Listen to me.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	What’s wrong with you?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	We came to this hotel, but something’s happening to us. We can’t figure it out.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Hotel? What are you doing in a hotel?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I don’t have time to explain. We needed to spend the night somewhere. We ran out of gas… it doesn’t matter. Get here as soon as you can.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Now?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Yes. Now.

FARHAD: [in Farsi] 	Why?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	There are people doing things… harassing us… I don’t know… I…

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Who? Are you okay?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	I don’t know. They’re stalking us. I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know what’s happening. Please get over here. Stop asking so many questions.

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	Did you call the police? What about the receptionist?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Yes, we did. No one is doing a damn thing! Please come, Farhad. Come!

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	You said calling the police was useless? Now you’re calling me. For what? What do you want me to do?

NEDA: [in Farsi] 	What’s he saying?

FARHAD: [in Farsi] 	Let me tell you something…put both of your minds at ease. Stop looking. There's no way out for you two.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What’re you saying, Farhad? Are you high? What are you talking about?

FARHAD: [in Farsi]	There’s no way out. There’s no way out. There’s no way out. There’s no way out.

NEDA: [in Farsi] 	Babak, could it be because of these?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Because of what?

NEDA: [in Farsi] 	These tattoos.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Are you out of your mind? Don’t talk nonsense.

NEDA: [in Farsi] 	I don’t know, maybe it’s some kind of a curse.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What’s that got to do with it? Please don’t start with any of your nonsense. What time is it? What time is it? What time is it?

NEDA: [in Farsi] 	Five years ago… when you came here… …I realized I was pregnant. I hadn’t heard from you for a while. You were supposed to return… …but you didn’t. I didn’t want to have a child without a father. I had an abortion.

BABAK: [in Farsi]	Why didn’t you tell me?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	What… what are you talking about?

NEDA: [in Farsi] 	The man at the door… said, if they hear the truth, it’ll be morning. As soon as I told the truth, the power came on. What are you hiding from me?

BABAK: [in Farsi]	This damned door’s lock is busted. We just have to get out of here. That’s all. Stay here until I return. Don’t go anywhere.
