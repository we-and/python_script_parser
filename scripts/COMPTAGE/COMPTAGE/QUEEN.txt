(QUEEN SUGAR)

(Episode #U13.13651)

(“Pleasure Is Black”)

						
					
VIOLET	Last season on Queen Sugar. I choose love. I choose you.	
								
NOVA		Everyone’s tellin’ me, write your own story, speak your truth.
						
SIERRA	Does your family know?
						
NOVA	No.	
								
VIOLET	I thought you said you had a gift for me.	
								
HOLLYWOOD		The only name on the deed to this building is yours.	
								
RALPH ANGEL	You know what prison is?	
					
BLUE	Where bad people go.	
					
RALPH ANGEL	I regret the things I done and I ain't never gonna do them again.	
								
SAM LANDRY	You made a deal with a woman who would stab her own brother in his back.
						
CHARLEY		The devil I know, the devil I don't, I'll conquer 'em all.	
								
NOVA		I'm an American and my family is an American family, and like all American families, we want the dream. Homes. Land. Space. Love. Being an American means we are	 beautiful. But also means we have a secret. That ugliness is also within us. I	 believe it is our secrets that are killing us. So in my book Blessing and Blood, I'm offering my truth as a sacrifice. An example of how we can	 all be free. And I hope that all who believe our	 lives depend on being better, truth tellers, will go on this journey with me.	
						
PEOPLE IN ROOM	 (continues under following dialogue)	
							
ROXANNE FRASIER	Excellent. How did that feel?	
			
NOVA	Uh, fine. I guess. Um, did I do okay?	
			
ROXANNE FRASIER	I could see your nerves a little. But that’s why	we do this. Maybe we should grab some lunch,	 talk over a few things?	
			
NOVA	Mm-hmm.	
			
ROXANNE FRASIER	Okay.	
						
PEOPLE IN CAFE	 (continues throughout following scene)	
			
DEBORAH	This will push your book	 over the top.	
			
NOVA	That’s amazing, Deborah.	
			
DEBORAH	Are you excited?	
			
NOVA	No! No, no, no, I- I’m very excited. Um, TV is... I’m just thankful.	
						
DEBORAH	As are we. Congratulations.	
			
NOVA	We'll-We'll talk soon.	
			
DEBORAH	And I'll keep you posted.	
			
NOVA	Okay.	
			
DEBORAH	Stay tuned.	
			
NOVA	Bye.	
							
ROXANNE FRASIER	Another good news phone call?	
			
NOVA	My editor just told me that I’m getting a New York Times book review. It comes out in a few (chuckling) days.	
			
ROXANNE FRASIER	That is not surprising at all. Nova, I truly believe you’ve written the next great American novel.	
			
NOVA	Except it's a memoir.	
			
ROXANNE FRASIER	Yeah, it didn’t stop Dave Eggers from becoming a superstar. That’s what we want, right?	
			
NOVA	Yes. It’s important folk know that I didn’t write this to gossip rag my famous sister. Or kick my	 brother when he’s just getting on his feet.	
			
ROXANNE FRASIER	So, let’s address the elephant in the room. You’ll need to be prepared for those who’ll say that kicking your family is what you’re doing.	
			
NOVA	Yes. Including maybe my own family.	
			
ROXANNE FRASIER	Wait. They know about the book, don’t they?	
			
NOVA	They know it's coming. But they don't know what's in it. Exactly.	
			
CHARLEY	It's official. You're spoiling me.	
			
ROMERO	Good That means my plan is working.	
			
CHARLEY	Well, your plans feel heavenly. Mm. But I'm warning you, I could get used to this. I	 can't believe I let you whisk me away like this. The real world awaits.				
ROMERO	The real world.	
			
CHARLEY	Mm. Harvest waits for no one. Not even me. And Micah's coming home soon. So...	
			
ROMERO	Yeah. The real world does await, but not yet.	
			
MASSEUSE	You're all done, sir.	
			
ROMERO	Thanks.	
			
MASSEUSE	Enjoy your day. We'll be right outside.	
					
SUBTITLE ROMERO	No more talk of the outside world. It's just us now.	
						
SUBTITLE CHARLEY	You are a kind man. Loving...	
			
SUBTITLE ROMERO	and very patient.	
			
ROMERO	Mi amor.	 I'll wait for you, for us, for as long as it takes.	
			
CHARLEY	Gracias.	
			
ROMERO	Your Spanish is good.	
			
CHARLEY	Yeah.  A lot of things are getting good.	
			
VIOLET	Oh, those look good. Oh, I'm gonna get me a mess of these mirlitons.	
						
HOLLYWOOD	What you gonna do with them ugly things? It looks like a pear that couldn't make up its mind.	
			
VIOLET	Don't judge a book by its cover. They're gonna be delicious. I'm gonna stuff 'em with shrimp,	 and bake 'em, and serve 'em as a special menu item in my diner.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Oh, your diner.	
			
VIOLET	Hmm.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	I love the sound of that. Now you know I'm all	 for your experiment, but these folks don't want	 nothing but some delicious pie and a burger.	
			
VIOLET	Yeah. Well, they're getting more than that. They're coming to Vi's, they're gonna have to	 keep up with me. As I am a world traveler with fancy tastes now.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Yes, you are.	
			
VIOLET	Mm-hmm. And, and an ever-expanding palette. And the next trip... Australia.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	I don't know about all that. No, man. Do you know how long that damn flight is? We're better	 just going to the moon. No, Thailand was good enough for me.	
						
VIOLET	Well, that food was on point, that's for sure. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh, maybe I should do a Thai night.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Maybe we can do a thigh night.	
						
VIOLET	All right. Thank you for a dream honeymoon, baby.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	No, thank you. But you know your dream just now starting, right?	
			
VIOLET	Goodbye, High Yellow. Hello, Vi's Prized Pies and diner.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	And Diner, huh? Yeah. Oh, it's gonna be good. So, you know, everybody coming.  Cardale, Prosper...	
			
VIOLET	Remy gonna make it back in time?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Nah, man. Remy's still moving his folks down to Houston. But you know who else	 coming? Boogie's cousin Junior and he gonna sing.	
			
VIOLET	Hmm. I never met nobody called Cousin Junior that could sing.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Nah, I didn't say sing. I said sang. You gonna see. Oh, I'll never do nothing bootleg.	
			
VIOLET	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know what the best part of all this is? That I get to do my dream in home.	
			
MALE SHOPKEEPER	That'll be twenty dollars.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Yeah, it's gonna be a good thing, brother.	
						
VIOLET	Mm-hmm.	
			
IGNACIO/BENNY	(walla)

BENNY	Yeah. I’m watching Mr. Ignacio here. Learning. Taking notes.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Have fun. Roll out, fellas.	
			
PROSPER	The postman dropped this off while I was by the house. It looked important.				
RALPH ANGEL	Thank you for your time and everything, Mr. Prosper.	
			
PROSPER	Yeah, you don't need me looking over	 you. You harvest eight hundred acres, you're doing just fine. Everything okay?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	State’s been backed up a few months. I think this might be it. (reading) "Ralph Angel	 Bordelon, on behalf of the State of Louisiana and the Border Probation and Parole, this letter serves you as your official notice. The parole	 period for Ralph Angel Bordelon concluded on	May thirteenth of this year. No further	 obligations in connection with the below listed conviction are due to the State of Louisiana."	
						
PROSPER	Look at that. The sun ain't shining on you today. That's your daddy. Yeah. Looking at you pleased	 and proud.	
			
GUESTS AT PARTY	(continues throughout	 following scene)

VIOLET	All right, at the insistence of my husband, I am gonna say just a few words. But words don't	 capture this moment for me. I just wanna say thank y’all for being here and I wanna say thank you to my ancestors for being everywhere. And...	
						
RALPH ANGEL	I got you. Congratulations.	
			
VIOLET	Thank you, baby. And I just want to say welcome to Vi's Prized Pies and Diner! Whoo!	
				
CHARLEY	We ready for round two?

VIOLET	Hey, baby. Uh, let's get them some of our specially made mini pies.	
			
LITTLE GIRL	Can I have this? Mm-hmm, that's it.	
						
CHARLEY	Really, gentlemen? The only prize we have is more pie.	
			
MALE CONTESTANT	Mm-hmm. More pie?	
			
CHARLEY	Yep. Really? It's Vi's Prized Pies and Diner.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Looks like you don't need the money.	
						
NOVA	I got one banana cream deluxe and three fresh lemon strawberries right here.	
			
CHARLEY	Good to see you, Councilwoman Barrera. Thanks for coming.	
			
ISABEL BARRERA	Please. Just Isabel. No re-election campaigning today. I just came by to celebrate Vi. Violet looks amazing and so happy.	
						
KEVIN	Oh, hey.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Wow! What you say, Kev?	
			
TOINE	Hey.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Ah! What you say, Toine?	
			
TOINE	What's going on, boy? Good to see you, too, man.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Thanks for coming by.	
			
TOINE	Yeah, man, of course.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Man.	
			
TOINE	Yeah.	
			
KEVIN	Give me some, give me some, yeah!	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Ah. Come on,	
			
KEVIN	All right.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	How you been?	
			
KEVIN	I'm good, man. I'm good.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	All right. Thank you for coming.	
			
KEVIN	Yeah, nice. This is good.	
			
TOINE	No problem, man.	
			
KEVIN	It's a nice turnout, man.	
			
TOINE	Yeah.	
			
CHARLEY	Two presents for Violet? Generous.	
			
ISABEL BARRERA	One's from me, the other is from Frances Boudreaux. She sends Violet her best.	
			
CHARLEY	Mm-hmm. You and Frances are friends?	
			
ISABEL BARRERA	Landry Enterprises made a sizable donation to my re-election. I thought you knew about that. You are still a partner?	
			
CHARLEY	I don't own enough shares to attend board meetings. I get the minutes and an occasional check. That's it.	
			
TOINE	Kevin asked me to talk to you about setting up a re-entry program.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I already got a worker. Benny. I don't see how I can need much more help.				
TOINE	Now look, you got a farm and it’s harvest time. It needs working. It may as well be someone you	 know need a second chance.	
							
FEM. GUEST AT PARTY	I thought about that.	
			
ISABEL BARRERA	Frances has certainly been very generous as of late.	
			
CHARLEY	Hmm.	
			
ISABEL BARRERA	She even paid for my new consultant.	
			
CHARLEY	Really?	
			
ISABEL BARRERA	But, you know, we do what we need to do to in order to get the job done.				
CHARLEY	Hmm.	
			
ISABEL BARRERA	In the end, as long as it benefits St. Jo's, that's all I care about. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going	 to go give Violet my love.	
			
CHARLEY	Yeah.	
			
TOINE	Hey, maybe this is the way you pay your pops	back for not giving up on you? I'm telling you	 it'll make you feel right inside.	
			
BLUE	Mom!	
						
DARLA	Hey! How's Blue's corner going?	
			
BLUE	Done. Sold out like... that!	
			
DARLA	It's always nice when things work out like that. You got your overnight bag?	
BLUE	It's in Aunt Vi's office. I'll be right back.	
						
RALPH ANGEL	Don't run, Blue. Slow down.	
			
VIOLET	So, when's this Cousin Junior gonna get here?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Soon. Oh, there comes Darla.	
			
DARLA	Congratulations, Ms. Violet.	
			
VIOLET	Oh, thank you. Well, there's plenty food if you want to make yourself a plate before you go.	
			
DARLA	I would like that. Thank you.	
						
HOLLYWOOD	Bring it down, Vi.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Come on.	
			
VIOLET	Hey, baby.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Come on, Aunt Vi. You ain't have to do it like that.	
			
VIOLET	What? I didn't do nothing to that child. I said hi. Took her gift and offered her a plate. What else	 you want?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	She trying. We doing all right trying to raise Blue together. Good, even.				
VIOLET	Well, y'all need to raise your standards. 'Cause passing Blue between you like a plate of day-old	 bread every weekend ain't gonna win you no parenting awards.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Day-old bread?	
			
VIOLET	Love you though. Come, come over here, baby.	
						
DARLA	I, um, I need a little favor. Do you, uh, do you think	 that you could take Blue on one of my days next week?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Everything all right?	
			
DARLA	Oh, yeah, it's just, um, just something I need to do.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Why're you being all vague, Darla?	
			
DARLA	It's personal.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Personal? What kind of personal something gonna keep you from Blue?				
DARLA	I have a date, Ralph Angel.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Date? I mean, I mean you got the right and all. Just didn't know it was happening	 like that, but... I could, uh, I could get him in the morning?	
						
BLUE	I'm ready, Mom!	
			
DARLA	Yay! Give your dad a hug.	
						
RALPH ANGEL	I'mma see you, boy.	
			
BLUE	Love you.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Be good.	
			
BLUE	I will.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Love you, too.	
			
BLUE	Bye.	
			
DARLA	How was your day?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Vi! Vi!	
			
VIOLET	What? Who's here?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Boogie's cousin Junior.	
			
VIOLET	Really? Now? What's he gonna sing?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	I just told him to go for it. Improvise. Come on.	
						
COUSIN JUNIOR	I'd like to dedicate this Violet Bordelon. I've heard this is one of your favorite songs. (singing) « Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me	I was once was lost, but now am found T'was blind but now I see »
						
VIOLET	Whoo-hoo! Wow! Guess he really can sang!	
						
HOLLYWOOD	Congratulations, baby.	 Thank you. Go Junior! Go Junior! Go Junior! Come on here, playboy. Come on, pretty boy. Yeah, come on now.	
					
NOVA	Here you go.	
			
PARTHENA	God bless you, Nova! My sister lives in New York. Says she saw a big sign about Nova's	 book coming out in about two weeks.	
			
PROSPER	How come you ain't tell nobody?	
			
PARTHENA	Walking 'round here serving pies like you need a job. This the last time we'll see her serving anybody.	
			
NOVA	Now St. Jo's my home. Always will be. Y'all know that.	
			
PROSPER	Yeah, but it's exciting though having all this happening for you?	
			
NOVA	I'm excited about my book tour. It's s-small. Just a few cities in the south. But--	
			
PROSPER	No, no, no buts. Don't apologize for success. Life is short, enjoy all of it. You hear me?	
			
NOVA	Sir.	
			
PARTHENA	So, what's the book about? Can we get a little preview? Maybe a little taste?	
			
NOVA	You'll just have to buy yourself a copy.	
						
PROSPER	Mm-hmm.	
							
NOVA	Hey, 'Wood? Vi wants some more Dutch apples. You know where I could find them?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	So, when do we get to read your book? Nova, you ain't never been shy about nothing	 you ever did. But you ain't even gonna tell me	 about a book coming out? I gotta hear it from other folks? Something ain't right about that book.	
			
NOVA	Hollywood...	
			
HOLLYWOOD	What did you put in the book? How you think it's gonna make your aunty feel when she find out?	
			
NOVA	It's been harder to talk about than I thought it	 would. But I will.	
			
VIOLET	Thank you, fellas.	
						
HOLLYWOOD	Yeah, well, I took a vow. And what I meant is more important than what I said. And what I	 meant is to make that woman as happy as I possibly can. Come hell or high water.	
			
NOVA	I respect that.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Yeah? 'Cause if you're even writing about twenty-five percent of the family secrets that I	 know, then we need to be prepared. You owe us at least that. In the pot right here.	
			
YOUNG NOVA	You ain't gonna tag me, Charley. Better get after lil' Ralph Angel.	
			
YOUNG CHARLEY	Nova, be for real. He's too easy to catch.	
			
YOUNG RALPH ANGEL	Am not. I can tag y'all too. Just play fair.	
			
YOUNG NOVA	I always play fair.	
			
YOUNG CHARLEY	Really, Nova?	
			
TRUDY	Nova, Charley, Ralph Angel! Dinner's ready.	
			
YOUNG NOVA	Yes, Momma. Coming.	 Play time's over. Come on. Race you to the front porch!	
						
ROMERO	Did you like it?	
			
CHARLEY	Stop fishing for compliments. You know I did.	
			
ROMERO	I'm not. I'm just saying I could use less pimento next time.	
			
CHARLEY	Oh, less pimento.	
			
ROMERO	Yeah.	
			
CHARLEY	Makes all the difference?	
						
ROMERO	Look, I don't want to assume anything. We had a great time over this summer, but, um, Micah's coming home tomorrow and...	
			
CHARLEY	And what? Our summer romance is over?	
			
ROMERO	Stop. I-It's... I-I just know it's a, a big deal to introduce me to him is all.				
CHARLEY	See, that's what I love about you.	
			
ROMERO	Love?	
			
CHARLEY	What I appreciate about you is how thoughtful you are. But honestly, I, I'm not even thinking	 about next steps. I'm just living for the moment.	
			
ROMERO	Is this new for you?	
			
CHARLEY	But that doesn't mean I want it to stop. This. Us.	
			
ROMERO	Neither do I.	
			
CHARLEY	I have harvest.	
			
ROMERO	And then the, uh, dinner event.	
			
CHARLEY	Mm-hmm.	
			
ROMERO	What's it called again?	
			
CHARLEY	"The Boss Women of NOLA." What?	
			
ROMERO	I think it sounds kind of hot.	
			
CHARLEY	Woman in charge?	
			
ROMERO	Yeah.	
			
CHARLEY	Well, get to work.	
						
RALPH ANGEL	Come on, come on. I like that little flair.	
			
LITTLE BOY	Whoa! I got it!	
			
BLUE	I can catch it on the run, Pops.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I know you can catch it. All right. You a big boy now?	
			
BLUE	Yeah.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	All right, go far. Go long now. Come on, Blue. Go far. That's a perfect throw.				
JOIE	I got it!	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Oh.	
			
BLUE	That was for me to catch.	
			
JOIE	You weren't gonna get it, butter fingers. So, finders keepers.	
			
BLUE	You better give me back my ball.	
			
JOIE	Take it.	
			
DEESHA	Joie, give that nice boy back his ball.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	It's all good. It's all good.	
			
JOIE	Wanna play "fight?"	
			
BLUE	Uh, how about we just, uh, go use the bouncy	 house instead.	
			
JOIE	Okay.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Hey, be good, Blue. And be nice. I mean it.	
			
DEESHA	Joie can be without boundaries sometimes.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	It's cool. Honestly. Blue's kind of easy.	
			
DEESHA	Blue?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah. Blue.	
			
DEESHA	That's a wonderful name. Strong. Creative. Full of feeling.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I like it. It's kind of beautiful, huh?	
			
DEESHA	Yeah.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Just like him.	
			
DEESHA	'Course, um, half the girls Joie plays with think she's too tough. She's a one-play-date-and-out kind of girl.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah, well, my boy plays with dolls. So... I get it.	
			
DEESHA	It's cool you're good with that.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	It's a toy. Kids play with toys.	
			
DEESHA	I'm Deesha. Brown-Sonnier. Grew up not too far from here. St. Thomas.				
RALPH ANGEL	St. Thomas.	
			
DEESHA	Mm-hmm.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	All right. I'm Ralph Angel. Bordelon.	
			
CHARLEY	What? The Johnsons are three hours late for their mill time? No. No. Get them on the phone.	 They can't back us up like that.	
			
MALE MILL EMPLOYEE	Yes, ma'am.
			
CHARLEY	Nova? Everything okay?	
			
NOVA	Yes. I know you're busy with Harvest. But I thought maybe we could grab a bite together. Later?	
			
CHARLEY	Oh! Uh, well, I would love to but I'm, I'm going to a women-in-business panel tonight. NOLA.
				
NOVA	Well, I can go with you.	
			
CHARLEY	No, it's not that big of a deal. I'm barely gonna get there myself. What's going on?
				
NOVA	Well, m-my book will be	 out soon. And...
				
CHARLEY	Oh! Oh, wh-why didn't you say anything? I-I thought it was coming out in a few months. Congratulations! Yeah. Oh!

RALPH ANGEL	You should be proud of it. You know what?	
			
BLUE	What?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I wanna show you something that I'm proud of, too. Came in the mail for me the other day.	 It's a letter from the government saying your daddy ain't on parole no more.	
			
BLUE	What's "parole" mean?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	It's another one of them "P" words we been talking about. Penal system. Parole. Prison. Police.	
			
BLUE	When you had your big "time out"?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	'Cause of some things I did a long time ago. Yeah. You know how Mr. Jarvis be checking on	 me sometimes? See if I'm doing good? That's parole. Out of prison but going back real quick. This letter says I'm done with all that.

BLUE	Good job, Pop.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Thanks, buddy.	
						
FEMALE HOST	As the first	 black woman to own a sugar mill in Louisiana she has had to blaze her own path.	 It gives me great pleasure to present Ms.	Charley Bordelon with our Two Thousand and	Nineteen Groundbreaker of the Year Award. Please everyone give a big NOLA congratulations to Charley Bordelon.	
						
WOMAN AUDIENCE#1	Whoo!	
			
CHARLEY	Thank you. Wow!	 Um, thank you for this honor. Uh, to begin with, I would say we as women, we	 have to stick together. No matter what. Even when it's not easy, we have to show each other grace and push each other--				
FEMALE REPORTER	Excuse me. Excuse me. Mrs. Bordelon-West?	
			
CHARLEY	Yes. And it's simply Bordelon now.	
			
FEMALE REPORTER	Apologies. I'm a reporter with the New Orleans Daily News and I have some questions--	
			
CHARLEY	Perhaps we can	 do this at another--	
			
FEMALE REPORTER	Would you say you're generally supportive of all women?	
			
CHARLEY	Excuse me? Of- Of course I am.	
			
FEMALE REPORTER	I've read an advanced copy of your sister's memoir, Blessing and Blood by Nova Bordelon.	 And in it, she reveals some disturbing truths about your role both during and especially after your ex-husband Davis West's sex scandal.	
				
CHARLEY	I don't know what you're	 talking about.	
			
FEMALE REPORTER	Okay, I'll be more specific. The book details the threatening actions you took towards Melina	 Galoudian, the woman who accused Davis of	 orchestrating her assault by several members of the L.A. Gladiators. The book alleges you made	 a payment of several million dollars to keep her quiet.	
			
CHARLEY	Anyone can allege anything.	
			
FEMALE REPORTER	So, now your only sister is just "anyone"? Nova Bordelon calls you and I quote (reading) "a	 tragic example of the American woman's unwitting but still complicit role in perpetuating gender inequality and rape culture as the price of	 full participation in patriarchal capitalism."	
			
WOMAN  AUDIENCE#4	Oh, my God!	
			
CHARLEY	I have no comment about that. Now as I was saying...	
			
FEMALE REPORTER	Do you feel you mishandled the Melina Galoudian incident?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Charley?	
			
CHARLEY	Rah. We need to talk.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	You all right? It's early.	
			
CHARLEY	Yeah. Yeah, I've	 been up all night. Did Nova give you her manuscript yet?				
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah. I got it. Why?	
			
CHARLEY	Do not read it 	Not yet. Let me talk to you about it before you do. Okay? Promise me, Rah. Charley, I don't know... Promise me, Ralph Angel!	
			
RALPH ANGEL	All right, I'mma wait for you.	
			
CHARLEY	I'm on my way. Uh, I'll be there soon.	
						
OLIVIA	Please leave a message after the tone.	
				
CHARLEY	Hi, Olivia. It's Charley.	 Call me back as soon as possible. It's urgent. I need you to draw up some	 papers regarding my sister's memoir. An immediate cease and desist. Um, just call me back, please.	
			
VIOLET	Daddy, could you bring me the new ? They're right there on the desk.	
			
NOVA	America's curse is its thin sense of freedom that demands we all pretend to be free. We lie. This	 is what we do. In Blessing and Blood, the lies I have lived are laid bare. The lies and shame that have shackled my family are dragged into the	 light of truth because what is real can heal. We see this clearly in the life of my Aunt Violet, a strong black woman, who lived much of her life as anything but that.	
			
NOVA	Blessing and Blood is a declaration of independence from the shame that binds us,	 cripples us, suffocates us. I break my family's inbred silence around country's naughty questions of ownership by asking the question we dare not speak. Does the existence of my sister's bribes endorse traditional notions of	  women as property? Does the circumstance of my nephew's conception and birth make my brother, Ralph Angel, less of a father? Less of a	 man? Is America's sense of virility really no more than that of my brother's? A twenty- something ego so fragile that we as a family have until now maintained a lie that his beloved child came from his loins. Daddy, I know you’re having a great, unending day up there. I pray it’s full of sunshine, peace, and joy beyond all	 understanding. I’m afraid, Daddy. Everyone is	 not going to understand what I’m doing. But I’m offering up my work hoping it	 will help us to see better. To be better.	 Because I grew up with too many secrets. You did, too. And it’s time we were all set as free as you wanted to be. So, please give me the strength to see this through.
