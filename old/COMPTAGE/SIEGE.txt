BLAIR	Now, that's an awful lot of noise coming out of there. 

SID	Hey, well it's big night for the kid. And he got the girl he wanted. 

BLAIR	Oh, yeah? 

SID	Yeah. 

BLAIR	After we got rid of her pa. 

SID	Yeah. 

BLAIR	We can't have the kid go to jail for killing a floozy. 

SID	Hmm. 

BLAIR	She was worthless anyway. And how about the pathetic sheriff that came along with her. 

SID	Yeah, and you know what pa? I could have taken him face on. 

BLAIR	Well, what would've happened then? Oh, he weren't good at math, so you know, he wouldn't had a bride then, would he? 

SID	Well, he sure got her now. And youyou know, you've been taking care of that kid since the day he was born. 
SID	Now that he's got a real woman he ain't got a clue what to do with her, so I'm thinking maybe... ...you know, maybe I should give him some pointers. 

BLAIR	Oh, I got a brother gonna outshine another brother, are you kidding me? Get the ruler out. 

SID	I should. 

BLAIR	Sure, we got a ruler in the bedroom. 

SID	Ruling brother. I'm suring my shoes there every night. 

JODY	Hello. 

BLAIR	Well, speak of him, here he is. Through a doorway, won't ya? A brother, a bit lit up. 

SID	Oh, no, look at you! 

JODY	Gentlemen. 

JOCELYN	Dear God, please help me. Come on, come on. 

JODY	Say, I'm looking for a woman, about yay tall, blonde, white dress, prettiest damn thing you ever seen in your life. 

SID	You already lost your wife. 

BLAIR	Where do you think she is right now? 

JODY	What? 

BLAIR	She's doing something youyou have never had nor will have except her. Getting prettied up for you. For you. Look at that pathetic face. She getting prettied up, that guy is kissing wood. 

JODY	Oh, Jocelyn. 

JODY	Oh, Jocelyn, my lady. 

BLAIR	She'll never touch your lips, son. She'll never touch your lips. 

SID	Silly drunk. Cheers to that. 

BLAIR	To Callahan boy, congratulations. 

JODY	Alright, drink, pa. 

SID	Let's get you some coffee. 

RED	Woah! Woah! Well, howdy, pilgrim. You play that thing? 

BILLY	Sure do. 

RED	Where are you headin'? 

BILLY	Meeting a friend up at the next station. 

RED	Rhyker's Station? Well, that's where I'm headed. Red Linstrom. 

BILLY	Billy Tyson. 

RED	Billy, good to meet you. Why don't you tie your pony up to the wagon and come on board! I could use the company. 

BILLY	Alright, then. 

RED	Where you from? 

BILLY	West Texas. 

RED	I saw you down in Mesilla. Uh, you were gambling with some Mexican kids, letting 'em win. I'm from Tennessee, myself. You're riding the grub line? 

BILLY	Sometimes. 

RED	Yeah, I used to do that when I was your age. Then they pinned a badge on me. I was that way for a couple of years, a young lady hog-tied me. I started a freight line, had to feed the wife and the kids. What about you, got a girl? 

BILLY	Nope. 

RED	Don't want to settle down? 

BILLY	Mm-mm. 

RED	Don't like responsibility? 

BILLY	Nope. 

RED	Yeah, I had a couple kids like you. Always having fun. 

RED	So what are you doing at Rhyker's? 

BILLY	Just meeting a friend at the next relay station. 

RED	Well, it's good to have you aboard. 

JOCELYN	Help! Please stop. Hel

RED	Woah, woah! 

JOCELYN	Help me! 

RED	That looks like Miss Miller and Sid Callahan. 

SID	Jocelyn! Oh, sweetheart! 

SID	We missed your reception. It's time to come home. 

JOCELYN	Help me! 

SID	My brother's waiting for this

BILLY	Let her go. 

JOCELYN	Help! Help me! 

SID	Well, back off, son. This here is my brother's wife. 

SID	Oh damn, she bit my hand! 

BILLY	I said, let her go. 

SID	Listen sonny, she's coming back with me, alright? 

TWIGS	Let this go, Sid. 

SID	Excuse me? 

TWIGS	That there is Billy Tyson. 

SID	Billy Tyson? Never heard of him. 

TWIGS	He'll take you down. 

SID	Oh, is that right? 

BILLY	Get on your horse and get out of here. 

SID	Well, I suggest you slap leather and get the hell out of my way. 

RED	Sid, you're more gurgling guts. Now leak out of the landscape. 

SID	Old man, you just mind your own business. Backing off, sonny, or what? 

BILLY	No, you are. 

SID	Damn! 

BILLY	Now you can die. Or we can talk about West Texas and the Bonneville Ranch. 

SID	This ain't over. Mm-mm, not by a longshot. And I'll be seeing you, sweetheart. 

SID	Find my pa. 

SID	He's back at the ranch. 

SID	Go. 

BILLY	You okay? 

JOCELYN	Yeah. 

BILLY	You okay. Ma'am, you're okay. Easy now. 

BILLY	You're riding a dangerous trail. 

TWIGS	So are you. And I got no answers. But that lady is Jody Callahan's wife and he's putting together his own posse. 

RED	I've got you, you're gonna be okay. 

TWIGS	You know, Sid's never been treated before. 

BILLY	Seemed like it was about time. 

RED	Let's get her in the wagon. I got some blankets at the back. It's gonna be dark soon, so we can set up camp in that canyon over there, it's got a spring. 

RED	I'll get her some water. 

BILLY	I'll get her some food. 

RED	We'll be at Rhyker's, tomorrow. Here. Callahans will be here in a couple of days. Go easy on the water. Here, get some rest. Don't worry about a thing, you'll be okay. 

TWIGS	Thought old man Callahan's with you? 

WILEY	Nah, he left couple of hours ago to check on Jody, back at the ranch. Where's Sid? 

TWIGS	Went back home, change his clothes. 

WILEY	What the devil happened out there? 

TWIGS	Some kid stepped in, Billy Tyson. 

WILEY	Ain't never heard of him. Sid take him down? 

TWIGS	Hmm, there was a standoff for a bit until Sid put his fist in that girl's face. 

WILEY	You know, Sid got a temper, ain't he? 

TWIGS	Yeah, yeah. But I'll tell ya, you ever seen a rattlesnake sunning itself, real peaceful like and then throw a rock at it? 

WILEY	Hmm, yeah. 

TWIGS	That's Billy Tyson. 

WILEY	Hmm, hmm, get on with it then. 

TWIGS	You know, it got hot. 

TWIGS	Sid went for his gun first, Billy was faster. Hell, Sid, barely has his Colt halfway out the holster before he was staring back at Billy's. 

WILEY	Yeah. 

TWIGS	Kid could have shot him dead, right there. But he waited, made him sweat. And then cool Sid shit his pants. 

WILEY	Where were you when all of this was going on? 

TWIGS	I was staring down that old man's rifle barrel. Yeah, I figured they went to that relay station over on Wild Horse Flats, Rhyker's. 

WILEY	Well, we got Hardy hanging out there. You keep a watch out for. 

TWIGS	Yeah, yeah. We'd best get back to the ranch and give our report. 'Cause Callahan is gonna wanna call the shots. But I don't think he's gonna want any trouble there at Rhyker's. 

WILEY	Let's go see the old man, then. 

TWIGS	Let's go. 

RED	Woah! You know, that was a pretty amazing thing you did putting your life on the line for that woman. Now we're goin' to Rhyker's... ...you're gonna meet your friend there? 

BILLY	He's not gonna be there. 

RED	Still coming with us? Okay. 

RED	Let's go take care of her. 

RED	Hey sunshine! Time to get up. 

RED	I think you need a drink, I know I do. Here. Okay, that's enough! You're gonna founder. How long have you been out here? 

JOCELYN	Almost a week. My horse threw me and ran off, two days ago. Left me without food and water. 

RED	Well, that's pretty rough. Where are you going? 

JOCELYN	I have an uncle at St. Louis. 

RED	Oh, we'll get you a stage at Rhyker's. 

JOCELYN	Can I pay when I get to St. Louis? 

RED	You don't have to worry about that. I got a load of goods here for Rhyker's, I'll get you something to wear. Here, come on down. I hope this fits, I know it's gonna look good on you. 

JOCELYN	Thank you. 

RED	Why don't you go over there somewhere and and get dressed. Billy and I will get the camp set up. 

RED	Now that's the girl I remember! Your daddy, he was a sheriff at Three Wells. You used to hang around the office. Here, have some coffee. It might be cold, but itit will be whip. 

JOCELYN	Thank you. 

RED	So you married a Callahan, eh? They're a pretty rough bunch. I heard they came up from Texas in a hurry. 

JOCELYN	Jody said they had some problems with the rangers over their brand. So they ended up selling their ranch and moving up here with their herd. Jody's a lot younger than his brothers, so they give him anything he wants. Guess that includes me. 

RED	I heard there were seven brothers. 

JOCELYN	There were. Three of them died in the war and two were shot down in Texas after the war. Squatters, Jody said. 

BILLY	West Texas? 

JOCELYN	I don't know. My mother died a few years ago. And then a couple of months back my father was shot down in the middle of the night. I was so lonely, and Jody was so sweet. A week ago we got married at the church. The reception was that night at Callahan's ranch. Everyone was drinking too much. 

SID	Oh, no. 

BLAIR	Well, speak of him, here he is. 

JODY	Gentlemen! 

SID	He needs pointers, I'm telling you. 

BLAIR	We'll drink to that, join the club. 

JOCELYN	My dress was so hot, and I was so tired, and it was loud and crowded, and I couldn't breathe. I stepped outside alone for a breath of fresh air. 

BLAIR	Don't y'all think it's noisy in there? 

SID	Yeah. 

JOCELYN	I could hear the voices but they couldn't see me. 

SID	Yeah, well it's big night for the kid. And he got the girl he wanted. 

BLAIR	After we got rid of her pa. 

JOCELYN	It was Sid and Mr. Callahan... ...talking about how my father was killed, so Jody could marry me. Something about stopping him from arresting Jody from murder. 

BLAIR	Can't have the kid go to jail for killing a floozy though, can you? 

JOCELYN	A floozy, they said. 

BLAIR	She was pathetic, that girl. 

JOCELYN	I stayed out of sight and was too afraid to go back inside. 

RED	You can have them arrested and hanged. 

JOCELYN	I think they said it was Sid who shot my father, but no one will believe me. It's my word against the Callahan's and they'll just deny everything, but it's the truth, I know it! I took a saddled horse with a canteen and bedroll, and I just rode away. 

RED	Where would you go? 

JOCELYN	North, to the stage road, but I got lost somewhere in the hills. Ended up on foot with no food or water. 

RED	I'm sure they know we're heading to Rhyker's. 

JOCELYN	Now I've got the two of you in trouble. 

RED	Don't worry. We'll be safe at Rhyker's. He's a good man, a tough man. And his wife is a Mescalero Apache, she's tough. She won't let anything happen to you. 

JOCELYN	Thank you. 

JOCELYN	And thank you for my dress. It'll always be my favourite. You were the brave one. 

RED	He's a kid, they're not too smart. 

JOCELYN	Is he blaming me for what happened? 

RED	Not at all. He's got his own misery, whatever it is. 

JOCELYN	He wanted to kill Sid so bad, his hand was turning white. 

RED	When Sid hit you in the face, that was just too much for Billy. 

JOCELYN	It was more than that. He looked like left-handed guy. I'm grateful, all the same. 

RED	Well, you're never going back to Callahan's. You're with us now. 

JOE	Honey, we got a stage coming! 

HAL	Hold! 

POTTS	This is an outrage! 

ELOISE	You were for sure in the lead, when they were handing out tongues, Mr. Potts. 

JOE	Ma'am. 

HAL	Hey, Joe, we've got a real problem.A real problem. 

JOE	How's that? 

HAL	Well, we were going down that ol' holy grade. I hit some rocks and broke that rear axle support, tore up the undercarriage. I mean, we're not gonna make it to the next stop. We're gonna have to fix it, now. 

POTTS	Well, then maybe he shouldn't have been going so fast. 

HAL	Well, Mr. Potts, if I wasn't such a good hand with my lines, we'd be at the bottom of that mountain, in a heap. That fresh team from the last station coulda hardly hold 'em back. 

JOE	Looks like we're gonna have to put you folks up for a while. You'll get your luggage soon as we get it down. 

POTTS	And I suppose you expect us to carry them? 

JOE	Yeah. 

POTTS	This could never happen in Boston. 

HAL	Joe, this is gonna take a couple of more days. 

JOE	Well, northbound ain't due for another week, give Chauncy some time to work on it, yeah Chauncy? 

CHAUNCY	Yes sir, boss. 

JOE	Alright. 

POTTS	What's that squaw doing here? 

JOE	Oh, that's my wife, Nellie. She's the cook, so you better watch your mouth. Unless of course, you wanna end up with a real belly ache. 

POTTS	And I'm expecting he is going to carry our luggage for us. 

JOE	No, he's a customer just like you. We'll get your luggage, sir, go on inside. 

JOE	(Indistinct speech) 

RED	Ho! Ho! 

RED	Hey Joe! 

JOE	Hey! 

RED	This is Miss Miller. 

JOE	Ma'am. 

RED	That the southbound stage? 

JOE	Yeah, it's busted. You got my goods? 

RED	Yes, sir. 

JOE	Chauncy will help me unload. You bring my apples? 

RED	Yes, sir, I did. 

JOE	Alright! Don't worry about the wagon, he'll take care of your team. That is if you're staying a while? 

RED	Oh, we're staying. When's the northbound due? 

JOE	Oh, about a week. They cut back on their runs, even though I told them the Mescaleros never come out this far. 

RED	Would you help her down? 

JOE	Sure, ma'am. There ya go. 

RED	And that's my friend, Billy Tyson. 

JOE	Howdy! You hungry? 

RED	They are. 

JOE	Well, let's get on in there and get a meal. 

CHAUNCY	Let me take your horse, son, I'll put him away. 

BILLY	Thank you. 

RED	Alright, that's right. 

RED	Who's that? 

JOE	Customer, name's Hardy. He's waiting on some friends. 

RED	Figures. Don't turn your back on him. 

JOE	You know something I don't? 

RED	I'll tell you later. Right now, she needs some freshenin' up. 

JOE	You got any luggage, ma'am? 

JOCELYN	No, sir. 

JOE	Alright, let's get you on inside. There you are. 

JOCELYN	Thank you. 

JOE	Who's that pretty young thing in there? 

RED	We picked her up a while ago. Sid Callahan was trying to grab her, the kid stepped in and made him cow down. 

JOE	You're telling me that kid is faster than Sid Callahan? 

RED	Hands down. The way I look at, Sid had to run home and change his clothes. But I gotta get rid of that girl. I'm gonna take her north in my wagon. 

JOE	They'll just track you down. And you'd be all by your lonesome. You'd be safer here, Red. What about the kid? 

RED	He ain't afraid of nothing. Except that girl. As for the Callahans, he's got a heat in him that's gonna boil over. 

JOE	How much time we got? I saw that Hardy ride off. 

RED	No, he don't matter. They already know where she is. 

JOE	Alright, let's get some grub. Come on in. 

CHAUNCY	Think we got this almost ready. 

CHAUNCY	Okay. You ready to put these on? 

HAL	Here we go. 

CHAUNCY	Okay. Alright. I wish, I drank more coffee, this morning. 

HAL	Well, that Nellie, she sure is a good cook. 

JOCELYN	I thought they could keep me safe, providedThank you, Miss Nellie. 

ELOISE	Thank you. 

JOCELYN	And then when I heard Sid and Mr. Callahan talking that night... 

NELLIE	Let's see if your boys will eat. 

JOE	Sure. You boys hungry? 

CHAUNCY	Hey boys, there's a rider coming. 

TWIGS	I've been sent to make a way for Jody to see his wife. 

RED	What for? 

TWIGS	He wants her back. 

RED	Well, she believes the Callahans murdered her father. Why the hell would she wanna see him? 

TWIGS	Well, he figures she owes him an explanation. He had no idea why she left, what she knows. 

RED	Alright. We'll bring her on the porch, but Billy and I will be with her and that's all. 

BILLY	No one's gonna touch her, not ever. 

TWIGS	Billy, you gotta know. The Callahans are planning to hang you for shaming Sid. 

BILLY	Figured as much. 

TWIGS	Alright. 

JOE	Friend of yours? 

BILLY	He's the only gun I could ever turn my back on. 

RED	Sounds like you don't trust anyone. 

BILLY	No, sir. 

RED	Alright, let's load up. 

ELOISE	Honey, honey. Why don't you go outside, get some fresh air and take a walk, it'll help. 

POTTS	What's going on? 

JOE	Nothing you need to worry about. 

POTTS	Well, if there's gonna be trouble, then something that we

JOE	You'll be on the southbound stage this afternoon, so mind your business and eat your meal. 

POTTS	Don't talk down to me, mister. I own half of Boston. 

JOE	Then maybe you ought to go back there. 

POTTS	I don't like your attitude. 

JOE	I'm just saying, if you don't like it out West, go home. 

POTTS	I'm gonna report you to the company. 

JOE	Be my guest. 

POTTS	There's something's going on. 

ELOISE	Well, whatever it is, you're not helping one bit. 

POTTS	You. Who are you to judge a man like me? You're a woman. 

JODY	Where's my pa and brother? 

WILEY	They'll be along tomorrow. How many men they got over there, Hardy? 

TWIGS	Uh, this old man works there, Rhyker and his Apache wife. The freighter, two passengers, Billy and the girl. And the stage coach driver. But it's pretty wide open all around there. 

HARDY	Twigs is right. The only cover is the high ground behind the house, there's a shed. I think we can get some men in the gullies around the place as well. 

TWIGS	There's a spring one canyon over. We can camp there tonight, get a little closer look in the morning. I say we camp three men at the South, three to the North, you and the rest come with us. 

JODY	Yeah. Okay, now it's pretty wide open, you can find a spot, right? Keep 'em from leaving. 

WILEY	Yeah. We'll figure out a plan. 

HARDY	Wiley, let's go. 

JODY	I wore my best new hat for her. 

TWIGS	Oh, well she ran out on you. 

JODY	Yeah, it's all that talk she heard. 

TWIGS	Yeah, all true, but don't forget, you were the one who beat up that floozy down at Mimi's, left her dead. 

JODY	She laughed at me. 

TWIGS	Yeah, I know. She also lived long enough to tell the sheriff and that's why Sid bushwhacked him. And your blushing bride knows all about it. 

JOE	Now what she does is, she cuts the apples real thin. And then she takes 'em and soaks em' in whiskey. That's the secret. 

BILLY	That sounds pretty good. 

JOE	Yeah. You're gonna have some pie. You're gonna love it. It's delicious. One of the reasons why

BILLY	We got company, boys. 

JOE	Yeah. 

JODY	Honey! Woah, woah. Honey, you in there? Honey, oh, my God! 

JOE	Yeah, that's far enough. You stay right there. 

JODY	No, look, II don'tI don't want no trouble, alright? 

JOE	Alright, alright. 

JODY	Alright. I just wanna talk to my wife. I got a right. Honey

JODY	Honey, what in the world did you run off in the middle of the night for? 

JOCELYN	You know what you did. 

RED	She heard your brother say that you killed a woman. 

JODY	What? 

RED	And her father was going to arrest you and they had him shot down. 

JODY	But therethere ain't no truth to any of it. That's that why you run off? Over a bunch of damn tall tales? Oh, come on, honey. Justjust come with me. 

JOCELYN	I'm not coming with you. 

RED	She's gonna have the marriage annulled. 

JODY	Oh, is that what you want? What just likejust like that. No! Let me tell you something right now, you don't come with me right now, a whole lot of innocent folks are gonna die. 

RED	Meaning? 

JODY	You know who I am? My pa and brother could have around 30 men around this station by morning! 

RED	We'll be here. 

JODY	You wanna die in this rat trap! All for keeping a man from his wife! That's my wife! You can save a whole lotta lives if you come with me right now. 

JOCELYN	I'm not coming with you. 

JODY	I'mma get you back, either way. You're mine! Tyson boy. You ain't nothing. You're a slug. You got lucky with old Sid. We'll see how you come out in the mornin'. We string you up. Unless y'all wanna turn tail. 

RED	We'll be here. 

JODY	Shit. It's on you, honey. It's on you! 

TWIGS	He means it, Billy. 

BILLY	Well, they don't have a lot of cover. 

RED	No, there's a gully back there. Then those mountains go straight up. 

BILLY	We'd better be prepared. 

JOE	What are you thinking? 

BILLY	I'm thinking we could use a drink. 

JOE	Me too, let's go. 

CHAUNCY	Remember to watch the crossing at Cibecue Creek 

JOE	Chauncy, is that the last one? Last one? 

CHAUNCY	That's the last one. 

JOE	Alright. Sir. Ma'am, see you. 

HAL	Giddy, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah! 

JOE	Good riddance. 

BILLY	You got any dynamite? 

JOE	Yeah, buried behind the barn, but they were already sweating, so they could be real dangerous. You know dynamite? 

BILLY	What's there to know? 

RED	When it's wet, it's nitro. 

JOE	Well, if it's wet, Red, we won't touch it. 

BILLY	I seen it done. 

JOE	Alright, let's go see about it. 

JOCELYN	Where are they going? 

RED	Off to get some dynamite. 

JOCELYN	They could get hurt. 

RED	Here, come on let's sit down. Rest a bit. You really like Billy, don't you? 

JOCELYN	He looked like he was gonna kill Sid and was upset he didn't. Why is he like that? 

RED	Before I got hitched, I was a lawman for a long time. I saw a lot of men with a lot of more than you could share. Billy is just like that. This is a rough country, builds hard men. You don't have to worry at all about Billy. 

HAL	Ho! 

HARDY	Put your weapons down! 

HAL	Who the hell do you think you are? You can't stop the US mail. 

JODY	Well, let me tell you something, Mr. Mailman. Until someone delivers me my lawful wedded bride, nobody's getting in or out. 

HAL	Your wife is back at the station. We have no business with you, stand aside! 

POTTS	I know my rights. Let us pass! 

HARDY	Get back inside! 

ELOISE	Let us go! We're not hurting anyone. 

JODY	Now, gentlemen. Ma'am. The Callahan boys always get what's ours. Now whether or not you wanna be bleedin' out in the dirt here. Well, I guess that's up to you. 

HAL	We're going through! 

HAL	You shot him, you son of a bitch! 

JODY	Turn around. 

HAL	Hiya! 

HARDY	Now head directly back to the Rhyker. 

BILLY	You ever blown anything with these before? 

JOE	Once. What are they doing? 

BILLY	Well, that's not good. 

HAL	Ho! 

JOE	What happened? 

HAL	That Jody Callahan and that customer of yours, they ambushed us, looking for that girl. In fact, they're not gonna let anybody leave until they get the girl back. 

POTTS	I say, give her to 'em. 

ELOISE	We're not gonna give her to them. 

JOE	Yeahno, we're not, I'm sorry about this, ma'am. Why don't you go on inside, Nellie will fix you something up nice. Sorry. 

BILLY	This is not good. 

RED	I don't know, you think they'll hit us all at once? 

BILLY	Not right off. They'll probably cause enough trouble to bring her out, but I don't think they'll do anymore killing. Too many witnesses. 

RED	Well, I hope your plan works. Let's go. 

JODY	Alright, listen up. Now as soon as my pa and the men get here... Well, wewe know what most of them likely to do. Except... What about Tyson? 

HARDY	What do you think, Twigs? 

TWIGS	Well, I don't know much. He never seems to work for anyone. But he's the fastest gunner, I ever seen. You go face on, he'll take you down. 

JODY	He let Sid walk away. 

TWIGS	Maybe he had his reasons. But ain't nobody gonna beat him to the draw. 

HARDY	Then we'll take him out anyway we can. 

JODY	How's that getting my wife back? 

HARDY	We're counting on the passengers to throw her out. Don't worry, kid. You'll have your wedding night and your honeymoon. 

JOE	I don't like this, Red. It's bad for business. 

RED	You better tell Chauncy to be careful. They'd love to find a hostage. 

JOE	Yeah, I already told him. 

RED	And those passengers, they're gonna be trouble. 

JOE	Ahan, I know. 

RED	We should always look at that draw, they might come down there. 

BILLY	Maybe they're arranging to get to the fence line? 

RED	Let's go in for some coffee. We better fortify this place. We can build some cover up front or up the windows. 

JOCELYN	Do y'all like Boston? 

POTTS	It's quite lovely. Keep your eyes on your own cards, please. 

ELOISE	Mr. Potts, you could be more of a gentlemen. 

POTTS	We don't have all night. 

ELOISE	Don't rush me, Mr. Potts. Two pair, kings over eights. 

POTTS	Straight flush. 

JOCELYN	I fold. 

POTTS	Of course you do. 

JOCELYN	Will y'all excuse me? 

ELOISE	Of course, honey, you go right ahead. 

JOCELYN	If people are killed, it'll be my fault. My own father was killed by Jody's family. I still feel so much guilt. 

BILLY	Your father was killed, because Jody killed a woman and your pa was gonna arrest him for it. 

JOCELYN	I still feel awful. 

BILLY	Nothing's your fault. Except being too pretty for your own good. 

BILLY	You know, you ought to go back inside. They could probably get their hands on you out here. 

JOCELYN	Not with you here. 

BILLY	Well, I'm just one man. 

JOCELYN	More like 20. 

BILLY	Mr. Linstrom said your pa was a good sheriff. 

JOCELYN	Yeah, he was, didn't like Jody much. 

BILLY	But you did? 

JOCELYN	When my father died, II was so alone and... But you're here, now. I better go inside before I say something foolish. 

BILLY	And before I forget you're a married woman? 

JOCELYN	I'm not married. Not like that. He never... You know what I mean. 

RED	Billy. You gotta a lot of learning to do when it comes to women. 

JOE	Are you almost done there, Chauncy? 

CHAUNCY	Yes, sir. 

JOE	Alright, follow me. Tell you what, after you feed the stock, leave the gate open, there's plenty of graze and feed out there. 

CHAUNCY	Well, if we do, they'll just kinda drift away and disappear. 

JOE	Yeah, but I don't I don't figure they'll go further than the creek. That way, we won't lose you so easy. 

CHAUNCY	Lose me? I feel like an old fence post, I'm kind of permanent around here. 

JOE	Let's hope so. 

BILLY	You oughta get some breakfast. 

RED	I was just figuring why we're here. You know, like knights of old and chivalry. 

BILLY	Chivalry? 

RED	Doing the right thing, protecting women. 

BILLY	And getting killed. 

RED	You scared? 

BILLY	No, sir, you're here. 

RED	Hope she has some bacon on. 

ELOISE	Thank you. 

JOCELYN	Thanks, Miss Nellie. 

POTTS	This is incredible. And no one seems to be worried. And that squaw over there, seems like she's ready to knife us. 

ELOISE	No. No, Mr. Potts, it's you she's watching all the time. I think she's admiring your hair. Make a great scalp to go over her stove. 

ELOISE	Why are you even here? I mean, if you hate it so much, why are you even

POTTS	Listen, I've told you, I'm my own salesman. Own my own clothing company. Make good money at it. Looking to expand. I'm looking for opportunity. 

ELOISE	Well, I'm selling some beef cattle. You interested? 

POTTS	Not a chance. Besides, I don't work with ranchers or farmers. 

ELOISE	You have a wife? Kids back home, Mr. Potts? 

POTTS	Absolutely not. Wives spend too much money. And they're always wanting something. Besides when you're gone, they spend every last penny you worked hard to get. Nope, no wife, no kids. How about you? 

ELOISE	Yeah, we do. Four boys and a girl. 

POTTS	Well, ain't you a peach. 

JOCELYN	That Mr. Potts would sell me off if he could. 

NELLIE	Don't worry. Anyone talks bad to you, I'll put salt in their pie. 

JOCELYN	You're really very nice. 

NELLIE	Only to people I like. 

JOCELYN	How long have you been married? 

NELLIE	Um, five years. Uh, and no children. A lot of men wanted me. I did not like them. 

JOCELYN	How did you end up with Mr. Rhyker? 

NELLIE	Joe was trading with my brother. When he saw me, he wanted me. So Joe brought horses. My brother said not enough. It went on for a long time. My brother was just playing with Joe. Finally, he said yes. 

JOCELYN	You speak so well. Did you go to school? 


NELLIE	No, Joe taught me. And how to do numbers and to read. But we have no children. Joe wants children, but he doesn't think it can happen. 

JOCELYN	He might be surprised. 

NELLIE	I think he will be. 

JOCELYN	When are you gonna tell him? 

NELLIE	Soon. 

JOCELYN	Congratulations! That's so exciting! You're gonna be a great mother. 

NELLIE	Thank you. 

CHAUNCY	Hal, couple of horses came off the hitch rack and they're looking for new grass. 

HAL	Oh, crimini! 

BILLY	I got a bad feeling. 

RED	Uh, they're not here yet. They'll wait for nightfall and come down that hill. We just don't have enough men to cover that gully. What's Mintz doing? 

CHAUNCY	A couple of horses got loose and he went to gather 'em up. 

HARDY	Take the shot, Wiley. 

RED	Mintz, get back here, now! 

HARDY	Damnit, what the hell was that? 

WILEY	Warning shot. 

RED	Hurry up! 

HAL	They're shooting, can't cover! 

HARDY	That's a warning shot. Let's go! 

RED	Poor Mintz, he was a family man. We can't let this go on. 

JODY	The hell is going on? 

HARDY	Wiley's getting soft or can't see for nothing. 

JODY	Jesus Christ. 

HARDY	And you know who you can count on to finish this. 

JODY	I justI don'tI don't feel right about this. Like what arewhat are we waiting for? 

HARDY	Your pa sent word, we was to wait for him and your brother. 

JODY	Yeah. 

HARDY	We'll get her back, Jody and then we're gonna hang that little bastard. 

BILLY	I think now is the time. 

JOE	Yeah, just lay down a barrage. Hit the stick near that cavern on the ridge. 

JODY	What kind of man keeps another man from hishis woman? 

HARDY	Yeah, you definitely got some unfinished business

JODY	Yeah. 

HARDY	But we have to talk about this later. 

JODY	Jocelyn! 

HARDY	Catch, Dylan, go after him. Now! 

JODY	Jocelyn! 

ELOISE	What was that? 

JODY	I think I'm concussed. 

BLAIR	Christ! 

JODY	Pa! 

BLAIR	What are y'all doing in here? Go on out there. Go up on the ridge. They took over all the ridge, come on! 

MAN 1	Come on. 

BLAIR	You don't hide in a house for Christ's sake, we're in a war! 

BLAIR	Grab that for me, won't you? 

SID	Sure thing. 

BLAIR	Well, that's enough of that stuff. Good thing you got a hard head. Are you alright, kid? 

JODY	Yeah, I'll be fine. 

BLAIR	You're not hurt? Oh, man. We gotta find a way to turn this around and get the advantage here. 

JODY	That's right. 

SID	Yeah. 

BLAIR	But we gotta turn it around, so it's fair for us. 

JODY	That's right. 

BLAIR	And they lose. 

JODY	Yeah. 

BLAIR	That's big artillery they're usin' 

SID	I've got an idea, pa. How about we send Twig to make a deal? 

BLAIR	That's a good Idea. 

TWIGS	I could end up a hostage. 

BLAIR	Please, don't whine about every goddamn thing. You're brave, you're smart! You'll work your way out of it. Go get it done, son. 

JOE	Get down! 

POTTS	What's going on? 

JOE	If you're not gonna fight, then just stay quiet and get down. You can watch the back window, at least. 

POTTS	Whatwhat happened? 

JOE	The driver tried to get away on horse, but they shot him. So we blew up some dynamite up on that ridge. 

POTTS	Well, did you kill 'em? 

JOE	Not likely. 

POTTS	Well, they're gonna wanna kill all of you. They don't want no witnesses. 

JOE	They're after the girl, Potts. So just sit down and shut up. 

POTTS	Well, all I've got is this derringer. 

JOE	You know what? Come nightfall, you can sneak out on foot. 

ELOISE	Sneak? 

ELOISE	You give me something to shoot with. 

JOE	You know how to shoot? 

ELOISE	My Grandpa Ines and my uncle often taught me how to take care of myself. You give me that gun. 

JOE	Here you go. 

POTTS	I don't wanna be a target. It's up to you guys to do all the fighting. 

ELOISE	I'll cover the back. 

JOE	Alright. Don't you worry about him, little girl. It's them out there got to be worried if we turn him loose. Just stay down. 

TWIGS	Billy. They'll give you one more chance. 

JOE	Yeah? They wanna get blasted some more? 

TWIGS	You send that girl out and come along, so they can hang you or they're gonna shoot this place full of holes. 

BILLY	How many are out there? 

TWIGS	Well, we got men to the north, blocking the road another group to the south. 

TWIGS	Callahans, Hardy, and six more guns. 

BILLY	How about that buffalo hunter? 

TWIGS	Wiley, he's out, back behind the station, but I don't know how long he's gonna hold out. 

TWIGS	He's got a big appetite. 

RED	Why are you here? 

TWIGS	Well, I wasn't sure... ...until now. 

BILLY	You coming over? 

TWIGS	Yep. 

BILLY	You know, you'll be the first one they hang. 

RED	Why should we trust you? 

TWIGS	Me and Billy, we go way back. And we got plans. 

RED	What do you think, Billy? 

BILLY	We go way back. 

RED	What now? 

TWIGS	Sure could use a decent cup of coffee. 

RED	Well, if Billy can trust you, you're alright with me. 

BILLY	I'd like to have a word with Twigs. 

BILLY	I reckon we oughta make this look good. 

TWIGS	Then you better take me prisoner. Noticed, Sid didn't flinch when you barbed brought up the Bonneville ranch, but he'll start thinking about it sooner or later. BILLY	We know they done it. 

BLAIR	What in the hell. What is Twigs up to? What's he doing? 

SID	He's trying to make the peace, pa. 

BLAIR	He knows we want the girl, right? 

SID	And Billy Tyson. 

BLAIR	And Billy Tyson! 

JODY	You know, if he don't come out soon though... 

SID	Is he still talking? 

JODY	Damn it! I want my wife! 

SID	Yeah, we know. Just relax. 

BLAIR	Question is, does she want you? 

JODY	She's just scared, that's all. 

TWIGS	All those raids, they had their faces covered, but there was a dead horse with a Callahan brand and the rifle with the same brand on the stock. 

BILLY	When you wrote for me to meet you here, I was hoping you might've found out who done it. 


TWIGS	I was with him long enough, but didn't learn anything for sure. But the smell is there. 

TWIGS	I hear Rhyker's wife is a damn good cook. Is she gonna feed me or knife me? 

BILLY	Don't be in such a hurry now. Come on, let's go in. I'll speak out for ya. He's okay. 

SID	Yeah, Twigs sure went easy. 

BLAIR	Maybe he's in there still talking. 

BLAIR	Bet the passengers are gonna have something to say about that, I'll tell you that. 

SID	Hmm. And maybe they'll send Twigs out with the girl. 

JODY	You know, maybe I oughta just go back in there and give it another try. 

BLAIR	No, son, it's too late for that. 

JODY	No, look. I sweet-talked her once before. 

BLAIR	It's too late for that! Hear me. 

SID	Yeah, we may have to hit 'em with everything we got. 

JODY	Now, come on now, I don't' want my wife getting hurt. 

BLAIR	She's not gonna. You can't go down there! You can't go down there! 

BLAIR	I'll tell you one thing I don't get about this whole thing, Billy Tyson. How is he in the mix in the first place? 

SID	Well, the girl bit me. 

BLAIR	Yeah. 

SID	She drew blood, so I hit her. 

BLAIR	She bit you? That was it? 

SID	Well, he also brought up West Texas. 

BLAIR	You were young, but we hit about 12 places in West Texas. But none of 'em was Tyson. 

SID	He brought up Bonneville Ranch. 

BLAIR	Yeah. I lost two brothers there to shotguns, they put up a fight, squatters. They really put up a fight. When we left there, there was no one left and we burned the place to the ground. So how the hell could Billy Tyson know anything about that? 

SID	I don't know, pa, maybe he's kin or something. 

BLAIR	Well, kin don't matter. He's got no proof. 

SID	No, he doesn't, but I don't think he needs it. 

POTTS	What is going on here? 

BILLY	Twigs is a friend. 

POTTS	And what about when your back is turned? If he's a friend of yours, we sure as hell can't trust you. 

NELLIE	Mr. Potts. 

POTTS	What? 

NELLIE	I suggest you take a seat and stop being such a Such a Yankee carpetbagger. 

POTTS	I'm just trying to stay alive, I suggest all of you do the same. 

CHAUNCY	Well, any friend of Billy's is a friend of mine. 

BILLY	Thank you, Chauncy. Do you mind taking a watch? 

WILEY	(Speaking Mescalero- Chiricahua) 

NELLIE	I speak American, old man. 

WILEY	Old man, is it? 

WILEY	I could smell that beef steak cooking a mile away. How you doing, Twigs? 

TWIGS	Which side are you on now, Wiley? 

BILLY	You know him? 

TWIGS	Yeah, he's okay. 

WILEY	I'm on her side. With her beef steak. 

TWIGS	Got a feeling you might be showin' up here sooner or later. 

WILEY	Well, I got hungry! 

TWIGS	This here is Billy Tyson. 

WILEY	Good to meet ya, son. 

BILLY	Anymore out there? 

JOE	Who's this? 

BILLY	This is Wiley. Twigs says he's okay. 

WILEY	I saw about six of 'em sneaking into your barn. But other than that, no. Alright. I'm Jed Wiley. 

POTTS	This is incredible. 

WILEY	Huh. Hello, ladies. I've seen your tracks out there quite a bit. 

JOCELYN	But you didn't tell 'em? 

JOE	You sure are trusting, Billy. 

BILLY	Well, anything Twigs says, I trust it with my life. 

JOE	And why is that? 

BILLY	He's my cousin. Keep that in your hat for now. 

TWIGS	I figure, they must've pulled in some more guns. Probably 10 hard cases over there with the Callahans and Hardy. But I know how we can lower the odds. 

JOE	And how is that? 

TWIGS	Me and Billy, we clean out that barn. 

BILLY	There's not a lot of cover out there. 

TWIGS	We have to move fast. We could take Wiley with us, but he might slow us down. 

WILEY	Well, that might be so... ...I bet I got a bullet to outrace all of ya. 

ELOISE	Listen, men, whatever you're planning, I'm in. 

JOE	Ms. Perimeter, you could get hurt! 

ELOISE	I'm a better shot than you think I am. 

JOE	Alright, ma'am. 

RED	We got it covered. But Potts here has to fight. Now we got Wiley, Rhyker, me, Chauncy. And this fine sharp-shootin' lady. And Jocelyn, well, her daddy was a sheriff. I figure she knows how to handle a gun. 

JOE	So does Nellie. 

RED	Good. Now let's to work. 

BLAIR	Twigs turned on us. 

HARDY	Yeah, and Wiley, too. I saw him go in that back window and there weren't any shots fired. 

BLAIR	Well, it don't matter. He's just an old turd, he lost it a long time ago. He's no matter. 

HARDY	Now what do we do? 

BLAIR	Take a couple of men, take 'em up there on the road and put 'em where Wiley was. And when at sunup, we're gonna give 'em everything we have. 

HARDY	Look, we don't know where the rest of that dynamite is. 

BLAIR	Well, it doesn't matter! They can't see it in the night time. And we're gonna hit 'em before daylight! 

JODY	Alright, now I've been patient, but pa, I don't want my wife getting hurt. 

BLAIR	Shut up! This is not the time to bring that up here. She's responsible for this whole goddamn mess. 

JODY	Well, I want her cute like I married her, not all mangled up like you fixing to do. 

BLAIR	It ain't about your wedding. It's about us not dying in a clan fight. 

JOE	Come on, boys, I dug this tunnel, it'll get you to the barn! 

JOE	Alright, here you go. It's a long way, boys, but you'll get there. 

JOCELYN	Billy. Please, be careful. 

TWIGS	You scare him half to death. 

JOCELYN	I hope I get to know him better. 

TWIGS	Someday. 

TWIGS	He didn't tell us it was a crawl space. 

BILLY	Well, at least he was kind enough to leave us some lanterns down here. 

BILLY	I think I see the end. We should probably kill the light. 

TWIGS	They're all around us. Just take as many as we can and get the hell outta here. 

BILLY	Well, better we do it. 

TWIGS	After you, Billy boy. 

JOE	Anything? 

ELOISE	Nothing. 

JOE	Jocelyn, you see anything? 

POTTS	Wait, hold on! What if it's not them? 

JOE	Right. 

JOE	Didn't think we'd see you two again. 

JOE	Well, welcome back. You alright? 

TWIGS	Well, now that was something. 

JOE	You should've seen her. She got real concerned, tryna go after you in the hole. Wiley had to pick her up, carry her out. She was screaming like a stuck pig. She's sweet on you. 

TWIGS	Well, we got five down. Still got all the Callahans, Hardy, probably six more guns over there. 

JOE	Well, what now? 

TWIGS	What do you think, Billy? 

JOE	Well, we've still got two more sticks of dynamite out there on the ridge and a Southern sniper in here. 

BILLY	It'd be a waste to use 'em now. 

JOE  	Alright. Let's hunker down until they come back. Nellie's got some hot coffee. You want some apple pie? Come on. 

HARDY	They hit us hard. The ones who weren't killed ran away. 

SID	So they're all gone? 

BLAIR	What? 

BLAIR	Just like that? 

HARDY	They got lucky, that's all. 

SID	So wait, wait, you're telling me we got nobody out there right now. 

HARDY	No, sir. 

BLAIR	Well, it doesn't matter 'cause in the morning, we're gonna hit 'em with a barrage that's gonna wipe that place out, every window, and a front bay, and everything else. Kill every goddamn one of 'em! 

JODY	Can't you just call some more men, they were just a bunch of clowns, anyway. 

BLAIR  	You don't have time for more men! We're here, because of one reason. We're all risking our lives in a clan war for your almost-bride. Get those guys back. Pay 'em double if you have to. Get a gun and kill someone. 

HARDY	Yes, sir. 

ELOISE	Mr. Potts, are you in? 

POTTS	Um, sorry. 

JOE	Billy, you and Twigs should get some rest. I'll take first watch. 

TWIGS	They'll hit us hard at daybreak. 

JOE	Alright, Chauncy, it's time. 

CHAUNCY	Alright. 

JOE	Let's go. 

NELLIE	Wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up. There's danger, come. 

ELOISE	Let's go. 

NELLIE	Go, go, go, go. 

TWIGS	Hey, Rhyker take over, gotta reload. 

JODY	Careful, don't hit her. 

BLAIR	Oh, for God's sake, shut up! 

JODY	Do you see her? 

SID	I don't see her. 

JODY	What you shooting at? 

BLAIR	Shut up! 

JODY	Dammit, Sid, don't you hit my wife! 

SID	Shut up, man. 

BLAIR	She's laying on the floor. 

JODY	You see her hit the floor, right? 

BLAIR	Nah, nah, she's standing up, she's got five bullet holes in her head. 

JODY	What? No! Don't you hit her! 

BILLY	You see those cans shining? 

ELOISE	Yeah. 

BILLY	That's where we hid the dynamite. Shoot for 'em. 

ELOISE	Yeah, I see it. 

SID	Son of a

SID	Jody, Jody! Jody! Ah, shit! Jody! Jody, pa! Jody ain't breathing! Jody! Jody! 

SID	Pa, are you alright? 

SID	You alright? 

BLAIR	Go kill every goddamn one of 'em! 

SID	Alright, alright, I will. 

BLAIR	Leave no one alive! 

TWIGS	You don't look too good, Blair. 

BILLY	Right after the war, you were raiding all the small ranches, outside West Texas. 

BLAIR	We needed the grass. 

BILLY	One of 'em was the Bonneville Ranch. You killed my pa and his ranch hands. 

BLAIR	So what? 

BILLY	You pistol-whipped a boy, threw him in a well. 

BLAIR	Yeah? 

BILLY	But I wasn't dead. Twigs here, came and pulled me up out of the well. 

BLAIR	That was you? 

BILLY	Then you dragged my mother behind the house. 

BLAIR	That was Hardy! That was Hardy! You're gonna shoot at a dead man? That was Hardy! 

BILLY	Where is he? 

BLAIR	Oh, wherever he is, he's running away, trust me. 

JOE	So I was theI was leading 'em and I shot. And he went down, tumbled like a steer. He went down like a steer. 

ELOISE	Bye. 

RED	You take care, young lady. 

JOE	Ma'am. 

ELOISE	You were wonderful. 

JOE	You, too. 

WILEY	Ma'am, such a pleasure. 

ELOISE	Bye, bye. 

RED	Alright, stage is leaving, boys. 

ELOISE	I'll miss you. 

CHAUNCY	Hiya, hiya! 

TWIGS	And it's done. Nothing's changed. Nothing at all. 

JOE	Sure, it has. Nellie's got some hot apple pie. Who wants in? 

TWIGS	Is that what it's comes to? Apple pie? 

RED	It's about it, son. It's all about hot apple pie. 

WILEY	And I can already taste it, gentlemen. 

RED	Wiley gets there first, there won't be any left for us. 

JOE	Don't worry, Nellie always hides a piece for me. Best wife a man ever had. 

RED	And every man should think that.That's why my wife is the best, she sent the apples. 

JOE	That she did, oh Red. 

TWIGS	Well, it's all over, Billy. Oregon's waiting for us. 

JOE	Well, now we can have some peace and quiet. 

NELLIE	Not for long. 

JOE	No, Nellie. It's over and done. Back to the same old routine. 

NELLIE	Not anymore, you're going to be a daddy. 

JOE	What? 

NELLIE	I said, you're going to be a daddy. 

JOE	What? 

NELLIE	Before snow falls. 

JOE	Ooh, what? Boys, I'm gonna be a daddy! 

JOE	Come on. Billy, Billy, I made a baby! 

JOE	Wooh! Everybody! 

BILLY	You can get on back inside, now. 

JOCELYN	I will not. What's next for you, Billy? 

BILLY	Oregon. Twigs and I are getting a spot. 

JOCELYN	Is that his real name? 

BILLY	No, it's Jess Bonneville. 

JOCELYN	And yours? 

BILLY	Billy Tyson Bonneville. 

JOCELYN	Jocelyn Bonneville, I like it. 

BILLY	Woah, woah. II didn't ask you. You can't just

JOCELYN	You save a girl's life, you have to marry her. 

BILLY	Now, youyou get back on in there. 

JOCELYN	Never.
