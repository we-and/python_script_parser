MADISON:		Hey, I'm almost there. 

BRYCE (OS): 		(On the phone) Great, drive safe. 

MADISON:		I don't know about this, Bryce. 

BRYCE (OS): 		(On the phone) You'll be great, don't worry. 

MADISON:		Uh-huh. 

BRYCE:			Ready? 

BRYCE:			Okay, here we go. 

JEFF:		It's-- I don't know.  It says it's connected.  Why aren't we meeting in person? 

MR. HYDE:		Bryce insisted. 

BRYCE (OS/ON): 	(On video call) You guys got it figured out on your end yet?  Jeff, great to see you.  Hey, sorry, I had to mix up plans like this, but we got called into another meeting, you understand? 

MR. HYDE:		Bryce, listen.  This is a tent-pole summer release.  We need a household name actor to carry it. 

BRYCE (OS/ON): 	(On video call) Mr. Hyde, I get it.  You think you need what?  Reece uh, or-- or-- or uh, Scarlet.  No, Madison Belle was born to play this role. 

LITTLE GIRL:		Oh, my gosh, it's Madison Belle! 

BRYCE (OS/ON):	Look, I hate to cut this short, guys.  We really do have to run.  Tryin' to convince Madison  to star in a film in another studio  and I gotta be honest,  they're really rollin' out the red carpet for her today. 

MR. HYDE:		Okay.  Uh, Bryce, just give us the weekend. 

BRYCE:			Nice! Excellent, guys.  That was perfect.  Good job. 

LITTLE KID: 		High five. 

BRYCE:			Great job.  Thank you so much. 

BRYCE:			Yes.  Good job. 

MADISON:		Uh, okay.  Um, I have to take this. 

BRYCE:			Okay, uh, don't forget to have Sarah validate you. 

MADISON:		Yep. Hey, what's up? 

LARRY:			Madison Belle? 

BRYCE (OS):		Yeah. 

LARRY:			You take her to dinner and a breakfast yet? 

BRYCE (OS):		Golden rule. 

LARRY:			Oh, meant to be broken. 

BRYCE:			No, it's not. 

LARRY:			You should make her your plus one tonight. 

BRYCE (OS):		Okay, look, Larry-- 

MADISON:		No, you said next spot. 

BRYCE (OS):		(Overlapping speech) To have this discussion.  I have rules for a reason.  And you of all people know  that mixing business and pleasure just doesn't work in the long run. 

SARAH:		Here's your suit, and your tickets for the premiere tonight,  and the after-party's at the SoHo House rooftop. 

LARRY:			There's nothing wrong with having a little work-related romance. 

MADISON:		It's been three weeks.  It's been three weeks, Zane.  Uh-- 

BRYCE:			Thank you. 

MADISON (OS/ON):	Canceling, again?  I have to rearrange my entire schedule for you,  again.  Yeah, again.  Yep. 

BRYCE:			No, stay seated. 

MADISON:		Yep, we're done. 

BRYCE:			No. 

MADISON:		We're absolutely-- mm. 

LARRY:		Madison.  Madison, uh, Larry Berger.  It is a pleasure.  A big fan of your work. 

MADISON:		Um, thank you.  Uh, can I get a-- can I get validation, please? 

SARAH:		You are smart, you are beautiful,  and gosh darn it, people like you. 

MADISON:		Bye, Bryce. 

BRYCE:			What are you doin'?  You don't even work on this floor. 

LARRY (OS/ON):	Alrighty.  To my wife and my girlfriends, may they never meet. 

BRYCE:			Larry, to takin' it too far. 

BRYCE:			Hey! 

DAVID: 		Oowie!  You lookin' suave in that tux, buddy. 

BRYCE (OS/ON):	Oh, thank you, thank you.  Uh, so sorry I couldn't make it.  Uh, got a movie premiere tonight. 

DAVID:			Oh, yeah, yeah. 

CHARLOTTE:		Oh my goodness, is that Bryce Dixon? It is!  And lookin' all LA fancy, hmm. 

BRYCE:			Wow.  Charlotte Ray. 

CHARLOTTE:		It's Charlotte Lott for about 12 years now  and you can say "hello" to Elizabeth and Margaret.  They got new last names, too.  Well, let me get a good look at you.  Oh, no glasses-- 

BRYCE:			Uh. 

CHARLOTTE: 		Or silly hair. 

BRYCE:			Right, yeah, well, uh-- 

CHARLOTTE:		My, aren't you fit? I am, too, of course.  We ladies get plenty of exercise.  Always runnin' after the kids. 

BRYCE:			Yeah. 

CHARLOTTE:		I'm sure your wife does the same. 

DAVID:			Bryce ain't married.  He's single. You know, it's like. 
CHARLOTTE:		Still livin' that bachelor life out there in California? 

BRYCE:			Well, you know. 

CHARLOTTE:		33, not married, no kids. 

CHARLOTTE:		Well, don't you worry, Bryce.  I'll get you a nice Alabama girl when you're out here. 

BRYCE:			You know, that's really not necessary. 

CHARLOTTE:		Oh, looks like Bryce is havin' trouble  in the romance department. 

MARGARET:		Poor dear. 

ELIZABETH:		Bless his heart. 

BRYCE:		Well, uh, you know, if you must know  I'm actually seein' somebody, so-- 

DAVID (OS): 		(On video call) Ooh!  Dixie, you keepin' secrets from me? 

BRYCE:			Well, uh, I really-- 

CHARLOTTE:		Oh, David, silly!  Uh, it's probably a big secret. 

BRYCE:			You get it.  You know me. 

CHARLOTTE:		He doesn't want the paparazzi followin' him around.  She's a movie star, right? 

BRYCE:			Uh--  I knew it! 

DAVID (ON/OS):	Who is it? Who is it? 

BRYCE:			Uh, who, oh--  You know, I really-- I shouldn't say. 

CHARLOTTE:		Oh, come on, Bryce.  You can tell us, we won't tell anyone. 

BRYCE:			Her-- uh, uh, her name is-- Madison. 

MARGARET:		Who? 

MARGARET:		Madison Belle! 

BRYCE:			I've already said too much.  Uh, I-- I-- 

CHARLOTTE:		Is she flyin' in with you tomorrow? 

DAVID:			Of course, she'll be here tomorrow. 

BRYCE:			With-- with-- on the trip?  I-- I don't-- 

CHARLOTTE 		I'm so excited.  I'm gonna tell everyone. 

BRYCE:			Okay-- 

MARGARET:		A real famous person in our little town. 

ELIZABETH:		Oh, except for you and your husband,  the mayor, of course. 

CHARLOTTE:		Oh, yes. 

BRYCE:			Yeah. 

CHARLOTTE:		Well, bye. 

DAVID:			Bye, buddy. 

BRYCE:		Yep, see you guys tomorrow.  Okay.  Madison.  Really that was-- was smooth. 

LARRY:			Another round? 

BRYCE:			Ha-ha! 

BRYCE:			Oh God. 

BRYCE (Reading):	"Join us as we welcome successful Hollywood agent Bryce Dixon  and his surprise famous girlfriend." 

BRYCE:			Okay.  Wait, did I just like that post?  No. No, no, no, no, uh--  Okay. 

BRYCE:			Alright. 

BRYCE (Reading):	"New theme!  Hollywood stars fell in Alabama. Dress up as your favorite movie star and have the time of your life." 

BRYCE:		Hmm. Oh, a prize is voted for uh, best couple's costume. You gotta be kidding me. You know what? Nobody reads these things anyways. 

BRYCE:			There weren't even that many people  in my graduating class! 

BRYCE:			Oh, come on! 
BRYCE:		It's not a big deal.  It is not a big deal.  This is silly, because you can just  um, not go.  You can just not go.  Yeah. Just-- you know, just say it's a--  A uh, work emergency.  Perfect. Yeah. I mean sure you know, some of my friends will be bummed,  but you know, I haven't seen--  I haven't seen you know, most of these guys in 15 years anyways. 

BRYCE:		I mean look, it's not like the whole town cares whether I go to some silly high school reunion. 

WOMAN 2 (OS): 	I'm here with Mayor Winton Lott, the person who brought palm trees to Main Street. He has some big news to share with us about the Willow Valley High School's 15-year reunion. 

WINTON:		Well, after learnin' our very own Bryce Dixon is comin' home from Hollywood with a movie star, I was thrilled. There's no better way to involve the town  than with a Main Street contest.  So we're inviting folks  to decorate their storefront windows as their favorite Hollywood movie. 

WOMAN #2:		What's the prize? 

WINTON:		$5,000. 

WOMAN #2:		Wow! 

WINTON:		Yep, and who knows?  Bryce Dixon might even put you in a movie. Hey, mom.  (Banging) 

BRYCE:		What? It is-- it's still early enough, there's time, she could still catch the flight. Uh, I'll just call her. I mean what's the harm in asking? I'll just call her and-- and ask. No, no, what are you doing? You-- Come on, look. You're not -- you're notin high school, okay? You-- you're not asking a girl to prom. You're calling a client, askin' a favor. Callin' a client, askin' a favor. Come on. (Phone ringing) 

MADISON (OS):	Hello, Bryce. 

BRYCE:			Uh, hey, Madison. Uh, morning.  Sorry, did I-- did I wake you? 

MADISON (OS):	Studio call yet? 

BRYCE:			Uh, no. No, not yet, we're still waiting, but uh, why are we whispering? 

MADISON:		I'm in my yoga boxing class. 

BRYCE:			Is that a thing? 

MADISON:		It's a thing.  Uh, why are you calling? 

BRYCE:		Uh, well, I um, I got you a-- a-- a-- a gig, a role,  another-- another role.  Um, you know, su-- super easy.  Uh, just a couple of days max. 

MADISON:		You know, I like more details about my roles.  More time to think it over. 

BRYCE (OS/ON): 	Yeah, yeah, of course, of course, I know,  but unfortunately with this one, we just don't have enough time. but um, don't worry about it.  Just you know, a couple of days uh, you know, some appearances, a-- a dance, all the barbecue you want. 

MADISON:		Oh, what kinda role is this? 

BRYCE:			Well, it is uh, actually more like a reunion. 

MADISON:		What? 

BRYCE:		Look, it is uh, it is just something to distract you while we wait for the big news. Alright? 

BRYCE:			Strictly work related, trust me. 

MADISON:		I trust you. 

MADISON:		You're my agent.  Two years ago, I was waiting tables  I didn't know how I was gonna pay rent. 

BRYCE:			Mmhmm, and soon you will be shopping  for a house in Hollywood. 

MADISON:		Yeah, all thanks to you. 

BRYCE (OS/ON): 	Okay, well, the gig is out of town, so pack a bag and uh, I will send a car to pick you up and take you to LAX in 30 minutes. 

MADISON:		Are you serious?  You never said it was out of town. 

BRYCE:			I just did. Huh, alright.  I'll see you at the airport. 

MADISON:		I can't.  I gotta take a shower, I gotta get food packed,  get a manicure. 

BRYCE:			Uh, Madison, still there? 

MADISON:		Bryce, I-- I'm sorry. 

BRYCE:			Okay. Um, yeah, yeah.  Uh, well, I-- I am sure that they will forgive me. 

MADISON:		Bryce?  Did you hang up on me? 

BRYCE:			Look, uh-- 

BRYCE:		Madison, I-- I wouldn't be asking  if I didn't really need this favor. Please. 

MADISON (OS):	You know what? Fine.  I need to get out town anyway. 

BRYCE:		Okay, okay.  Uh, great, I will be sending an Uber your way in 30 minutes. 

MADISON:		I need an hour.  And can you please tell me where we're going? 

BRYCE:			Alabama. 

MADISON:		Do I need to bring my passport? 

SARAH (OS):		You and Madison should be landing in Alabama by now.  I went ahead and confirmed all of your reservations for the reunion and as always, I went with the best available option. Have fun. 

BRYCE:			Okay, we are lookin' for-- it's D-12. 

MADISON:		Okay. 

BRYCE:			D-12. 

BRYCE:			Really? 

BRYCE:			This is the best available. 

MADISON:		Yes. Yes, it is. 

MADISON:		Come on.  I'm callin' her "Big Red". 

BRYCE:			Real tight. 

MADISON:		Do you like football? 

BRYCE:		Oh, that's part of the Holy Trinity down here.  Yep, it is uh, God, country, and football, and uh, not necessarily in that order.  Alright, drive will be about an hour. 

MADISON 		Okay, I'm now up to speed on classic Alabama music and your reunion Facebook page. I need to know all about your high school friends.  Mark and Ellie Rowan married right after high school.  Two kids.  He works in real estate.  Rick and Rachel Kemnade, two kids. Uh, whoa, she is really pretty. And David Brooks.  Divorced, serial entrepreneur.  Sounds interesting. It's kinda menacing.  Can't tell.  Huh, he does have kind eyes, though. 

BRYCE:		Yeah, he's uh, he's just an all-around great guy.  You know, all of my friends from out here, he's the only one who's made it out to see me in LA. But that was uh, but that was years ago, now. 

MADISON 		And uh--  I am assuming from the comments, you're Dixie. 

BRYCE:			Yep, Dixie. That's uh, that's what they called me growin' up. 

MADISON:		Hmm. Well, Dixie, nice to meet you.  I'm Madison. 

BRYCE:			Oh, hey.  Hey, Sarah. 

SARAH (OS):		You're alive and well in Alabama? 

BRYCE:			We are indeed. Did the studio call yet? 

SARAH:		Not yet, but you know, I'd patch that call through ASAP, boss. 

MADISON:		Sarah is a consummate professional.  She is the best at validating. 

SARAH:		Hey, Madison, you're the best and don't let anyone tell you differently. 

BRYCE:			Alright, thanks, Sarah. 

MADISON:		Don't laugh, but don't you think Sarah and I could be good friends? 

MADISON:		You keep things professional with everyone? 

BRYCE:			Guess so, yeah. 

MADISON:		And if these people here are your friends,  why didn't you just tell 'em the truth that we're not dating? 

BRYCE:			You haven't spent too much time in the Deep South, have you? 

MADISON:		No. 

BRYCE:		Yeah, well, things are a-- they're a little different here.  When I told some of the people I went to high school with that I was single, they--  I don't know, I-- you know?  It's like I-- I could feel their-- 

MADISON:		Pity? 

BRYCE:		Somethin' like that. Do you want that? Do you want a wife, kids, dog, the whole shebang? 

BRYCE:		Sure, yeah.  You know, some day with the right person, but right now, I am uh, just a little bit preoccupied getting my clients in hit movies. 

MADISON:		Yeah. 

MADISON:		It's hard to spend quality time with someone when you're never in the same city for more than 48 hours. 

BRYCE:			This a specific someone? 

MADISON:		Zane. 

BRYCE:			Oh, right. 

MADISON:		It was on again, off again. 

BRYCE:			It-- it was or-- 

MADISON (OS):	Yeah, it was-- it was. 

BRYCE:			Got it. 

MADISON:		His tourin' schedule is his biggest priority and I'm just tired of playin' second fiddle. 

BRYCE:		Well, you know what? I've found that personal lives, they're really quite overrated, you know? I mean who even needs 'em? 

MADISON:		Yeah. Easier to stretch the truth a bit. Say I'm your girlfriend. 

BRYCE:		Hey, look, first of all, you are a girl, okay, right?  And I would like to think that we're friends, so I don't think that's much of a-- 

MADISON 		Oh, wait, we're friends? 

BRYCE:			A lie, actually. 

MADISON:		Oh, my-- oh, I thought I was a client. 

BRYCE:			Okay. 

MADISON:		And word on the street is you never mix business with pleasure. 
BRYCE:		I do not, okay, which is why we are treating this as a role for you, remember? With travel, lodging, and all your meals included. That's a pretty good deal. 

MADISON:		And you men-- you mentioned a dance, too, right? 

BRYCE:			Mmhmm, yes, yes, you uh, well, you promised me a dance. 

MADISON:		Oh, well, I just never seen you as a dancer. 

BRYCE:			No, I'm full of surprises. 

MADISON:		Hmm, yeah, apparently. So how long have we been dating for? And it needs to be less than a year. 

BRYCE:		Um, I don't know. Uh, why don't we just say for a while? I don't know, something like-- 

MADISON:		No. 

BRYCE:			What, what? 

MADISON:		I'm so sorry. Just no one's gonna believe you if you say it like a question. 

BRYCE:			Well, I'm not. 

MADISON:		But okay, okay, so we've been dating a while, you're taking me to your reunion. 

BRYCE:			Mmhmm. 

MADISON:		Some people might see a ring in your future. 

BRYCE:		Look, one day, I actually think that I will make a pretty darn good husband, but uh, how about this weekend, just trying to be a perfect gentleman. 

MADISON:		And I would expect nothing less, but from time to time, to create a believable illusion, you're gonna have to put your arm around me. 

BRYCE:			Well, if that's okay with you, ma'am? 

MADISON:		Hmm. And Dixie. 

BRYCE:			Mmhmm. 

MADISON:		Will I be required to kiss you? 

BRYCE:			No. No, no, absolutely not. 

MADISON:		So I don't need to have my agent negotiate for my money in case there's a nude scene. 

BRYCE:			Look, you-- 

MADISON:		Calm down! Relax! It's gonna be fun, we're gonna have a fun weekend. 

BRYCE:			I hope so. 

BRYCE:			Alrighty, here we are. Good old Willow Valley. 

MADISON:		This place is amazing. You haven't been back to even visit your parents? 

BRYCE:			Uh, no. I, um-- 

MADISON:		I don't think I've ever seen you at a loss for words. 

MADISON:		I kinda love it. 

BRYCE:			We're almost there. 

BRYCE:			Mrs. Miller? 

AGNES:		Oh, Bryce Dixon, give me a hug! And you can call me "Agnes" now.  Oh! 

BRYCE:		Uh, Mrs. Miller, here-- sorry, Agnes uh, was my high school English teacher. 

MADISON:		Oh. 

AGNES:		So, you're his girlfriend Madison? Small town and you two are the talk of it. 

MADISON:		Well, it's very nice to meet you. 

AGNES:		I always knew you'd be successful,  but a Hollywood producer, well, that just tickles me pink! 

BRYCE:			Uh, actually, I-- I'm an agent. 

AGNES:		Well, either way you make movies, don't you? and I've got your next project right here.  My script. 

BRYCE:			Oh, for me?  Great, thank you. 

AGNES:		Now, your assignment, young man, is to read it and give me notes. 

BRYCE:			Okay. 

AGNES:		Um, let me get your room key. You're at the end of the hall on the top floor. 

BRYCE:			Great. 

AGNES:		As requested, I put you in the best available. Just the thing for you two lovers. 

BRYCE:			Uh-huh, thank you so much. 

MADISON:		Thank you. 

BRYCE:			Uh, I'm pretty sure we can find our own way. 

AGNES:		Oh, good to see you, always. 

BRYCE:			Uh, thank you so much. Great to see you, Miss Agnes. 

AGNES:		Please. 

BRYCE:			Alrighty, can you grab the key? Actually, you want some light reading? 

MADISON:		This. 

BRYCE:			Uh, this is us. Phew. 

MADISON:		Wow! 

BRYCE:		Oh, come on. Uh, they put us up in the honeymoon suite clearly decorated by the Home Shopping Network. 

MADISON:		Does the bed vibrate? 

BRYCE:			I certainly hope not. 

MADISON:		You know, I for sure thought it was gonna be a water bed, but um-- 

BRYCE:			Well, in any case um, obviously, I'll be staying over here. 

BRYCE:		Perfect fit. Uh, but you know what?  There's no time for a nap. We're meeting the gang in 30. 

MADISON:		Got you. 

BRYCE (OS):		Okay. 

MADISON (OS):	Zane, you've gotta stop. No, I will not meet you in New York. 

MADISON (OS):	I um, made new plans for the weekend. I mean it, Zane, we're through. So Dixie, was this your plan all along? 

BRYCE:			Um, I'm sorry uh, my plan? 

MADISON:		To lure me to Alabama and impress me with your fancy truck, and fancy suite, and sweep me off my feet? 

BRYCE:		Uh--  What? You're joking. Yeah, that's-- that's-- that's very funny.  Is that a "no" then to honeymooning at the Willow Valley Inn, 'cause-- Look, my high school buddies, they're uh-- Uh, I apologize in advance. Please, just humor them. 

MADISON (OS):	You don't know me very well, do you? 

BRYCE:		You know, I uh, might have been misinformed about the attire for this evening. 

MADISON:		You can never be overdressed or overeducated, right? 

BRYCE:			Man, I spent many a drunken night right here back in high school. 

DAVID:			Funny, I remember spending last night here. 

BRYCE:			Hey, hey, hey! 

DAVID:			Oh, welcome home, Dixie. 

BRYCE:			Alright, David, this is Madison. 

DAVID:		The glamorous Madison Belle from all my favorite movies. Damn!  I said I wasn't gonna gush. 

BRYCE:			Mmhmm. 

DAVID:			Pardon my language. 

BRYCE:			And Madison, this is my old pal David who helped me-- 

MADISON:		Helped you build that tree house when you were 12-- 

BRYCE:			Uh-huh. 

MADISON:		And saved you more times than you could count in high school. 

DAVID:		You heard about me. Can y'all move back here, so we can all be besties? 

BRYCE:			Alright, how about uh, all the drinks on me tonight? 

DAVID:			Thanks, hot shot. 

BRYCE:			Pleasure. 

MADISON:		Actually, David, how about the best of three darts say buys first round? 

DAVID:			Alright. Alright, here we go. 

RICK:			Who let the riffraff in? 

BRYCE:		Rick! Mark! It's good to see you guys. Alright, alright. Ooh! When you both become such big huggers? 

RICK:			You both? Don't you mean y'all? 

BRYCE:			Y'all. 

BRYCE:			Oh man, Rick, you look-- 

RICK:			Older. 

MARK:			Yeah, man, it's been way too long. 

RICK:			Yes, please, tell us everything. 

BRYCE:			Oh, now, there's really just uh, nothin' to tell. 

RICK:			I'll be damned.  Bryce Dixon bein' modest. Thank God. 

DAVID:			Bull's-eye wins. 

MADISON:		Hmm, okay. 

DAVID:			You and Bryce Dixon, y'all seriously datin'? 
MADISON:		Did he say something? 

DAVID:			Only that he's proposing to you this weekend. 

DAVID:			Works every time. 

MADISON:		You're a cheater! 

DAVID:			Yeah. 

MADISON:		Okay. Fine. 

DAVID:			Ringer. 

MADISON:		Hmm. 

DAVID:			Two beers for her. On me. How did you do-- 

BRYCE:		Yep. Guys, I'm happy. I'm truly happy. I-- I really-- I love my life. It couldn't be better. 

RICK:			You have everything you want? 

MARK:			What's your secret, man? 

BRYCE:			Come on, keep your eyes on the prize, Madison. 

RICK:			What the hell does that mean? 

MARK:			I think that means he likes her. 

BRYCE:			Drinkin' or what? Go. 

RICK:			I'm halfway down. 

BRYCE:			Good to see you guys. 

DAVID:			Oh! 

MADISON:	 	Ooh. 

DAVID:			Beat by a lady! 

DAVID:			Well, a woman anyway. 

DAVID:			Can you help me surprise Dixie? 

MADISON:		Bryce! When you order a beer, you get a whole bucket. 

DAVID:			And the bucket's gonna have to wait. We're up next at cornhole. 

BRYCE:			Oh. 

MADISON:		Ooh, I love corn. 

DAVID:			Oh, I love women. Madison's on my team. 

MADISON:		Wooh! 

MADISON:		Wooh! 

MARK (OS):		He's just at the college and he's managin' the home section over in the garden lot, right? 

MADISON:		Okay. 

MARK:		And he decides to take a few marijuana seeds, put 'em in some of the planters. And he's watered 'em real diligently. And after a few weeks, they're really shootin' up. 

DAVID:			That's why it's called "weed". 

RICK:			So he puts a sign next to 'em that says "natural aromatherapy plants". 

MADISON:		What? 

BRYCE:			Son of a-- 

DAVID:			And then they fired me over it. 

RICK:			So David got to collect some unemployment. 

MADISON:		Well, in LA we call it "fun employment". 

DAVID:			Hey, I like that. Oh. 

BRYCE:			I better knock you off the board. 

MADISON (OS):	Come on, boys. 

MADISON (OS):	Squish. 

BRYCE:			That's how you do it. 

DAVID:			Alright, alright, Dixie. 

BRYCE:			Come on. 

DAVID:			Alright, Dixie. Watch this, Dixie. Watch this now. Watch it. 

BRYCE:			I'm watchin'. 

DAVID:			Watch it. 

BRYCE:			What I'm about to watch?  Hey! 

MARK (OS):		Oh, what is-- 

MADISON:		Oh, great goin'! 

BRYCE:			What is-- 

DAVID:			Oh! 

RICK:			Doof. 

DAVID:			Roll-- 

BRYCE:			That's the best uh-- 

MADISON (OS):	Yeah, it did. 

BRYCE:			Alright. 

DAVID:			Oh, tie, baby. 

RICK:			Tie, baby. 

MADISON (OS):	Redemption. 

DAVID:			Wooh! 

MARK:			Arc it. 

MADISON:		Okay. 

BRYCE:			Nice. 

MADISON:		Beginner's luck. 

MARK:			Come on, we got this. 

BRYCE:			Okay, we're on the board. 

MADISON:		So you work for Kevin, the ham? 

MARK:		Yeah. Kevin Weathers is my boss. And no, he ain't changed a bit. And yeah, I find it ironic that I work for the same jackass that made my life miserable all through high school. 

MADISON:		Hmm. 

BRYCE:		You remember when uh, when Kevin used to put the ham on your shoulder when you weren't lookin'? 

DAVID:			Oh, like every day of middle and high school. 

BRYCE:			Yeah. 

DAVID (OS):		Oh, my God. 

RICK:			Oh. 

BRYCE (OS):		You're strong. 

MADISON:		Better luck next time. 

BRYCE (OS):		On the board. 

MADISON (OS):	Wooh! 

DAVID:			Ooh! 

BRYCE:			Alright, finish it up. Come on, now. 

RICK (OS):		Ooh, there it, there it is, there it is. 

DAVID:			Oh. 

BRYCE:			Ooh. Oh, alright. 

DAVID (OS):		That was good. What's up? 

RICK:			Madison and David can win it right now with a miracle toss. 

MADISON:		Now, I'm nervous. Okay. 

RICK (OS):		No pressure. 

MADISON:		No pressure, yeah, hmm. 

BRYCE:			Come on. Come on. Beginner's luck. 

DAVID:			Mark's flyin' and Bryce is buyin'. 

BRYCE:			Alright. Round's on me. Good game. 

DAVID:			There we go. There we go. 

BRYCE (OS):		Yeah, yeah, drinks on me.  Y'all, let's go. 

MADISON:		Yeah, it is. 

WINTON:		Wooh! How is Willow Valley? Yes! It's good to see you, guys. How you doin'? Huh. How's it goin', Samantha? How are the family? How are the kids? Doin' good? Always good to see, imp. Auburn. Oh my goodness. I knew it, Rachel. Oh yes, it's you. 

MADISON:		Okay, that's a step in the right direction. Few more beers and I might actually get to see the real you. 

BRYCE:			Oh, okay, is someone havin' a good time? 

MADISON:		Yeah. 

MADISON:		Well, I was promised all the barbecue I want.  Yeah. 

BRYCE:			Well, I hope you like ribs. 

MARK (OS):		Alright, and fries. 

MADISON:		Okay. 

DAVID:			Now, Madison, if you are secretly a barbecue-eating champion,  				I swear I'm yours forever. Forever. 

BRYCE:			Watch it. 

DAVID:			Forever. 

BRYCE:			Oh, you got some right there. 

MADISON:		Oh, do I? 

BRYCE:			Yeah. 
WINTON (OS):		Look who it is? All the way from California. Bryce Dixon. 

BRYCE:			Winton. 

WINTON:		Uh, it's Mayor Lott. 

KEVIN:			Mayor. 

WINTON (OS):		And this must be the lovely Madison Belle. 

MADISON (OS):	Hmm, mm. 

MARK:			Hey, Kevin. 

WINTON:		Welcome to uh, my LA, Lower Alabama. Our town sure is excited 	to have you here. 

MADISON:		Nope. 

WINTON:		Ah. 

MADISON:		Nope. 

WINTON:		I'll take that. 

DAVID:		Now, Winton here, he is the best third-string quarterback at Alabama I've ever seen in my life. 

WINTON:		Bryce, can you get David here write jokes on The Tonight Show? 

BRYCE:			Hmm. 

WINTON:		Hmm. 

BRYCE:			Possibly. 

WINTON:		Mm. Well, I gotta get movin' on. Lots of hands to shake, elbows to bump. Great things are happenin' here in Willow Valley. 

BRYCE:			Great things. 

MADISON (OS):	What is this? 

KEVIN:			Just a little joke between buddies. 

MARK:			Yeah, funny one, Kevin. 

BRYCE:		Okay. Alright, guys, seriously, why do you let them get away with stuff like that? 

RICK:		A lot's changed in the last 15 years. You get to stroll in here for a weekend, we gotta do business with these guys every day. 

DAVID:			Mmhmm. 

BRYCE:		Alright, but answer me this one. How in the world did Winton Lott become the mayor? 

RICK:		Well, you see, Dixie, we got these uh, days down here in the South  where we all get together every few years and we do this little thing	called "vote". 

BRYCE:			Oh yeah? 

RICK:			Mmhmm. 

MADISON:		I gotta pee. 

BRYCE:		Come on, I'll show you where it is. Alright, gents, you wouldn't uh, mind excusin' us for just a minute. We'll go freshen up and get back. 

DAVID:			Make good choices. 

MADISON:		Oh, this has been the most fun like-- 

BRYCE:			Are you drunk? 

MADISON:		Um, maybe. 

MADISON:		But drunk or sober, I really love your friends. 

BRYCE:			Yeah. 

MADISON:		Yeah.  Rick needs to loosen up a little bit, though. 

BRYCE:			Old history. 

MADISON:		Well, maybe you'll have to tell me sometime. Boop. 

BRYCE:			Okay. 

BRYCE:			Alright. 

BRYCE:			Oh! 

CHARLOTTE:		Prettyin' up? 

BRYCE:			Uh, yeah, well, you know, all this doesn't just happen on its own. 

CHARLOTTE:		Seems LA agrees with you. You're even more fit in the flesh. 

BRYCE:		Well, you, Charlotte, are lookin' quite fit yourself. What? Have you been doin' some gardenin'? 

CHARLOTTE:		I've been meanin' to ask you somethin'. 

CHARLOTTE:		You wanna kiss me. 

BRYCE:			Well, that's not a question. 

CHARLOTTE:		I didn't think it was either. 

BRYCE:		Wait, wait, wait.  Charlotte, you uh, you're-- you're married.  It'll be our little secret. 

CHARLOTTE:		Do I kiss better than her? 

BRYCE:			Better than who? 

WINTON:		Would you do me the honors? 

MADISON:		Okay.  Oh. 

WINTON:		Ooh! Don't worry. I never fall. We'll see you tomorrow at our friendly football game? It's one of the uh, many tourist attractions that I brought to this town.  So a favor to ask of you. As our celebrity guest, would you help judge our main street window contest? 

MADISON:		Well, I can't refuse the mayor and the local football hero. Ooh! 

BRYCE:			Rachel? 

RACHEL:		Oh, my gosh, hey! Oh, it's been a while. 

BRYCE:			Had fun watching your exclusive social media. 

RACHEL:		Yeah, yours, too. 

DAVID:			Less talkin', more dancin'. 

RACHEL:		Okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 

BRYCE:			Why don't we get on in there and show 'em how it's done, huh? 

RACHEL:		Let's do this. 

MADISON:		I saw you in the parking lot. 

BRYCE:			Okay, Charlotte kissed me. 

MADISON:		Oh, the mayor's wife. You kissed back. 

BRYCE:			What?  It's not like that. 

MADISON:		Then tell me moral history I wouldn't understand. 

BRYCE:			Honestly, yeah.  Hey. 

TAYLOR (Singing):	? What you've done to me ? 

BRYCE:		Look, it was just a kiss.  ? Look me in the eyes ? ? With the sad, sad look ? Come on. 

TAYLOR (Singing):	? That you wear so well ?  ? When you see my face ? ? Hope it gives you hell ? ? Hope it gives you hell ? 

MADISON:		Whoops. 

MADISON:		Hope it didn't hurt much. I didn't come here to be embarrassed, Bryce.

DAVID (OS):		Alrighty, friends, it's time to go. Who's designated drivin'? 

MADISON:		Uh, I'm gonna call it a night actually. I'm gonna catch an Uber. 

RICK:			Heck no. We got the babysitter for two more hours. 

RACHEL:		Yeah, that's right. When the kids are away, the adults will play. 

MADISON:		Where are we going? 

DAVID:			And turn that off, we don't get caught. 

RACHEL:		I am not spraining an ankle. 

BRYCE:			We used to sneak into the school at night and swim in the pool. 

RACHEL:		Yeah, it was fun. 

DAVID:			It still is. 

BRYCE:		You know what? No, just uh, leave it to the expert. Pay attention. The trick is push, hold, lift, partly turn, and--  Huh? 

RICK (OS):		Hey. 

BRYCE:			What would you guys do without me? 

RICK:			Go back to the bar. 

BRYCE:			Get inside. Go, go, go, go. 

DAVID (OS):		Awesome! 

RICK:			At least, he wore boxers this time. 

DAVID (OS):		Wooh! 

MADISON:		Did they catch us? 

RACHEL:		No, honey, but could you please get your butt in the pool before all the blood rushes from my husband's head. 

MARK:			Wooh! 

DAVID:			Ooh! Wooh! 

RICK:			What? 

RACHEL:		We're goin' to the gym, starting Monday. 

DAVID (OS):		Woo-hoo! 

RICK (OS):		Heads up! 

MARK (OS):		Forget how much you loved Willow Valley? 

DAVID:		Man, this is heaven. This town has everything you want or need  except for a cold beer right about now. 

RACHEL:		Hey, Mark, when does Ellie get here? 

MARK:			Oh, I got a text.  She's workin' early tomorrow, so she can't make it. 

RACHEL:		Okay. 

RACHEL:		Love you, honey. 

DAVID (OS):		Alright, alright, I surrender, I surrender! 

MADISON:		Fine, fine. But only if you give me dirt on Bryce. 

BRYCE:			Oh. 

DAVID (OS):		You mean Dixie? Okay, Dixie was a run-of-the-mill super dork with a little bit of troublemaker mixed in. Mmhmm. 

RACHEL:		Yep, he was the chess club president. 

MARK:			Master debater, um-- 

DAVID:			One time, Dixie got us to fill this entire school with crickets. 

MADISON:		No, poor little guys. What-- No, it was genius. Yeah, we uh, we actually let 'em in through the air vents very gently. 

MARK:		Chirpin' was so loud that we couldn't even hear the teacher, so they had to cancel school for two days. 

DAVID:			Mmhmm. 

RACHEL:		Yeah. Yeah, and he was one of the good guys. 

BRYCE (OS):		Okay, thank you all, so very much, for telling her all that. At least, you didn't tell her I was into magic. 

DAVID (OS):		Or the drama club. 

RICK:			Uh, not that there's anything wrong with actin', I-- 

MADISON (OS):	Mmhmm, yeah. Uh, anyway, this is such great material and everything, but I need blackmail material. 

ALL: 			Oh! 

RICK:		Oh, well, Bryce always got away unscathed while the rest of us took the fall. 

MADISON:		Hmm, and ex-girlfriends? 

RACHEL:		Oh, we've been on a date or two. 

MADISON (OS):	Hmm? 
BRYCE:		Technically, about six and a prom, but who's counting? I was his first kiss. 

MADISON:		Oh, please, tell me that story. Please. 

RACHEL:		Well, Bryce was too scared to make a move, so after three dates, I kissed him. 

BRYCE (OS):		Hmm. 

RACHEL:		His eyes shot wide open and he froze. 

BRYCE:			I meant to do that, though. 

RACHEL:		It was cute! 

DAVID:			It all ended on account of his little Dixie cup. 

BRYCE:			Funny, what? 

RACHEL:		It was very innocent. And then after graduation, he moved away to California. 

BRYCE:			Yeah, and uh, never looked back. 

MADISON:		Well, Rachel, I'm so glad that high-school Bryce had fantastic taste. I would have thought he dated Charlotte. 

RACHEL (OS):		Oh. 

RACHEL:		No. 

DAVID:			You're good. That's rich, that's good. That's pretty good. 

BRYCE:			You, guys. 

MADISON:		Oh, it seems that Bryce has forgotten where he's from. 

BRYCE:			I-- 

RICK:			Ooh, mama. 

RACHEL:		Stop it. 

DAVID (OS):		Alright, love birds, I'm sensin' a little tension here. 

BRYCE:			Huh, did somebody say uh-- "Little"? 
DAVID:		Ooh, is that supposed be a joke about me, that's funny. Behave. I wanna see you two kiss and make up. Cheers. Wrong answer, Romeo. Kiss. Oh, pop that tick.  Kiss for real. 

RACHEL (OS):		Before David suggests a game of spin the bottle, night, y'all.  Get home safe. 

MADISON (OS):	Bryce, we need to make one stop on the way back to the inn. 

BRYCE (OS):		Well, as requested here it is, the house that I grew up in. 

MADISON:		I like it. Was it really that bad growin' up here? 

BRYCE:			Uh, no. It just wasn't me. 

MADISON:		You seem to get along just fine here. 

MADISON:		Do tire swings and tipsy people go together? 

BRYCE:			Well, usually uh, those two things are quite the recipe for disaster, so-- 

BRYCE:			Why don't we go ahead and play it safe? I'll show you the backyard. 

MADISON:		This is playing it safe? 

BRYCE:		Technically, if we get caught for breaking and entering,  we do know the mayor. Oh, come on. 

MADISON:		What was that? 

BRYCE (OS):		Huh? 

BRYCE:			Uh, I'll check it out. Hmm. 

MADISON:		In horror movies, this never ends well. 

BRYCE:			Oh, my God, Bear! 

MADISON:		A bear? 

BRYCE (OS):		No, uh, come here, buddy. Oh. So growin' up didn't have a dog, but did have a pet tortoise. Bear Bryant, meet Madison. 

MADISON (OS):	Hi. 

BRYCE:			Yeah, I named him after the legendary Alabama football coach. 

MADISON:		Oh, my gosh. Hi. 

BRYCE:		Yeah, and I gave him to uh, David when I went to college.  He won't bite you. Man, I spent a lot of time right here growin' up. 

MADISON:		I can't believe you haven't been back in so long. 

BRYCE:			Well, I didn't have a reason to. 

MADISON:		You haven't been back to visit your parents? Where are they? 

BRYCE:			Where are yours? 

MADISON:		Portland. 

BRYCE:			Maine or Oregon? 

MADISON:		Oregon. 

BRYCE:			Siblings? 

MADISON:		An older sister. 

BRYCE:			Hmm, it's interesting. 

MADISON:		You? 

BRYCE:			Only child. 

MADISON:		Hmm, that's interesting. And your parents? 

BRYCE:			Uh, well, they're d-- 

MADISON:		Oh my God, I am so sorry. I had no idea. 

BRYCE:			Oh, no uh, no, uh, divorced. 

BRYCE:		Yeah, thank God. Um, well, that they're-- you know what I mean? Yeah uh, they split about a month after I went to college. It got pretty messy. Dad went to Virginia and mom moved to Florida. Look, Madison, I-- I wish that I didn't-- 

MADISON:		I know. 

BRYCE:			Uh.  Shall we?  Well, that's too bad we can't go inside. 

MADISON:		David says, "Surprise". 
BRYCE:			David. 

MADISON:		Hmm. 

BRYCE:		Hmm. Well, it uh, definitely looks a little different. But it still feels like home. (Sighing) No way. Wow. (Bryce sighing) (Bryce chuckling) BRYCE: Wow. (???) 

MADISON:		So, where's your old room? 

BRYCE:			Alright, here it is. 

MADISON:		I guess nothing's changed. 

BRYCE:			Funny. Not funny. 

MADISON:		Thanks for bringing me here. 

BRYCE:			Well, uh, I know it's not exactly  the uh, Hotel Bel Air, but uh-- 

MADISON:		No, no, no. I meant to your reunion. 

BRYCE:			I'm happy you're here, too. 

MADISON:		Look, about earlier-- 

BRYCE:			No, I'm sorry, I-- I-- 

MADISON:		No, no I--  When I saw you kiss Charlotte or her kissing you or whatever, it hurt-- For no reason. And I know we're just pretending  and I know you never date your clients, but-- but still... ...being here with you, I like it. I like your friends. I like seein' you with your friends--  Am I babbling? 

BRYCE:			A little bit. 

MADISON:		Huh. 

BRYCE:			I-- I meant to do that. Yeah. Wait, we-- we shou-- shouldn't-- 

MADISON:		No. Rules are meant to be broken. 

DAVID (OS):		Cock-a-doodle-doo! 

MADISON:		Oh, sh-- 		

BRYCE (OS):		David, what are you doing, buddy? 
DAVID:		I got you coffee and doughnuts. And I reserved a VIP table at the diner for breakfast. 

MADISON:		Aren't the doughnuts breakfast? 

DAVID:			Honey, those are just appetizers. Welcome to the South. Road time. 

MADISON:		I heart him so much. 

BRYCE:			Yeah, he's the best guy I know. 

MADISON:		You're the best guy I know. 

BRYCE:			You're sweet. 

MADISON (OS):	Mm, good trouble. 

BRYCE:			I think you might actually need a new agent. Wait, um-- 

MADISON:		I don't know. It's gonna be hard to replace my current one. 

MADISON:		Since apparently, he never stops working. 

BRYCE:			Mmhmm. Well, you're up off early. 

SARAH:		Aw, isn't that cute? You've been in Bama one night and you've already got an accent.  Awful early, I do declare. 

BRYCE:			Okay, Sarah, just uh, tell me that the deal is done. 

SARAH (OS): 		Not yet, but I did follow up with the studio, but that's not why I'm calling. Just don't shoot the messenger. 

BRYCE:			What? 
`
SARAH (OS): 		TMZ spotted Madison. and you. I've already called PR and they're			handling damage control. 

BRYCE:			Okay, uh, great. Just-- Keep me updated. 

SARAH (OS/ON): 	Will now be a bad time to talk to you about my promotion to agent?			Perhaps tomorrow. 

DAVID (OS):		This is my favorite place in town, right here. 

MARK:		Sorry, I'm late. Kids might be catchin' a bug, so Ellie's at home takin' care of 'em. 
MADISON:		Hmm, I hope they get better soon. Right, Bryce? 

BRYCE:			Uh, yeah, uh, real soon. Sorry about that. 

DAVID (OS):		Alright, fried chicken, fried shrimp, fried catfish, French fries, fried cornbread, fried pickles. 

MADISON:		Is the water fried, too? 

MADISON:		What is happening? 

DAVID:			Come on, Bryce. That was comedy gold! 

BRYCE:		Look at this. Madison Belle caught getting cozy with a mystery man  outside a barbecue joint down South. 

MADISON:		It's fine, Bryce. It's just some photos of me dancing  and havin' a good time, which is not a crime. 

RACHEL:		I mean God forbid, someone has fun with their friends, right?  Right. 

BRYCE:			Yeah, except they're also leaking more photos. See? 

DAVID:			Oh, they got my good side! 

BRYCE:		Okay. Look, I just don't want anything to affect the studio's decision, alright?  That's all. 

WAITRESS:		Here you go, honeys. 

BRYCE:			Uh-- 

MADISON:		Thank you. 

BRYCE:			Oh, and can I give you this? 

DAVID:			Just top the whole thing off with hot sauce and you're good to go. 

BRYCE:			Yeah, to the hospital. 

MADISON:		Well, I will try anything once. 

BRYCE:			Oh, I got it. 

RICK (OS):		Say "thank you", Parker. 

PARKER:		Thank you, Parker. 
RICK (OS):		Thanks, Bryce. 

BRYCE:			No problem. Alright. Thank you. 

WAITRESS:		And instead of a tip for me, I have a tip for you. My daughter Kelly would be perfect for your next movie. She's a natural. 

BRYCE:			Honestly, I don't think I've been this full in like-- 

MADISON		15 years.

BRYCE			15 years. Did you just copy me? 

AGNES (OS):		Oh, Bryce! Oh, Bryce, you finished my script yet? 

BRYCE:			Um-- 

AGNES:		I'm not gettin' any younger. 

BRYCE:			Mrs. Miller uh, Agnes, funny seeing you here. 

AGNES:		Oh, visiting my son. The dentist. Now, when can I expect your comments? 

MADISON:		Agnes, we will see you at the inn.  We are actually headed to a football game and Bryce is playing. 

BRYCE:			Uh, yep. 

MADISON:		Yeah. 

BRYCE:		Uh, bye. Thank you for that.  Ah, fun fact. Here is where I had my first date.  Yeah. 

MADISON:		Aww. 

BRYCE (OS):		Yeah, Emily Becker, fifth grade, we shared a milkshake and French fries. I thought she was the coolest girl, because she had seen Batman & Robin three times. 

MADISON:		Who doesn't love Christian Bale? 

BRYCE:			Uh-- 

BRYCE:			Actually, it was uh, George Clooney. 

MADISON:		And Clooney was Batman? 
BRYCE:			Yes.  Yes, he was. Hi. 

MAN #4 (OS):		Hey. 

BRYCE:			A couple of lollies. 

MADISON:		Yeah. 

BRYCE:			Two of these, cool. Here uh, keep the change. 

MAN #4:		Thanks a lot. 

BRYCE:			Thank you. 

MAN #4:		Take care. 

BRYCE:			Red? Blue? 

MADISON:		Thank you. 

BRYCE:			This place, I mean seriously, the same as it's been. 

MADISON:		When was the last time you've been here? 

BRYCE:			That's 15-- 15 years. Okay. When was your first date? 

MADISON:		12th grade. 

BRYCE:			What? 

MADISON:		I was a late bloomer! 

BRYCE:			12th grade. 

MADISON:		Had a overprotective father. Okay? 	

BRYCE:			Oh. 

MADISON:		Gosh. 

BRYCE:			Lolly? 

MADISON:		Thank you. 

BRYCE:			Now, you feel better. 

MADISON:		Hmm. He's never liked anyone I've dated, but I have a feeling he might like my mystery man. 

BRYCE:			Look at that. Oh, I found a hat. 

MADISON:		I found a cane. 

BRYCE:			Ready? 

MADISON:		Whoa! 

BRYCE:			And-- Ta-daa! 

MADISON:		You got the moustache. 

BRYCE:			I'll direct to the actress. Do that, ready? I got it. 

MADISON:		Yeah. Cool, okay. And-- 

BRYCE:		Ready? Do a dance, Charlie Chaplin it up. That was actually pretty good! That's not bad. 

MADISON:		Oh. 

MADISON:		Oh! 

BRYCE:			Great store front, guys. 

BRYCE (OS):		Wow. 

MADISON:		Creative. Think we got a winner. 

BRYCE:		I would say this one is perfect. Definitely has my vote. Hey, speakin' of perfect, this weekend really has been... 

MADISON:		Perfect. 

ZANE (OS):		Madison! Maddy, hey! Ta-da! 

MADISON:		What are you doing here? 

ZANE:		I charted a jet this morning just to see you. Look, we need to talk.  Did you get my text? 

BRYCE:			Oh, hey, Bryce Dixon, good to meet you. 

ZANE:			Oh, hello. You a fan? 

BRYCE:			Uh, not exactly, but unfortunately, we actually are running late-- 

ZANE:			Mmhmm. 

BRYCE:			To a flag football game, so-- 

ZANE:	Oh, football! Okay, I love football. Yeah, sure, count me in.  This is nice. Hmm? Belle-Belle, can you believe it's been three months?  Yeah, they just keep adding shows to my tour. Popularity is a double-edged sword. 

BRYCE:		You know what, driver? It is just down the road on the right.  If you wouldn't mind uh, step on it, please. 

ZANE:		What are you doing in rural Alabama? I wasn't expecting all the paved roads. 

MADISON:		I'm here with Bryce. 

ZANE:			As in with or with with? 

MADISON (OS):	With with. 

ZANE:		Belle-Belle, you're my girl. What? No, we don't live in the same city. We're-- we're both fortune's fools, but did that stop Romeo and Juliet? 

MADISON:		Well, Zane, it should have. 

ZANE:		No, they happily died in each other's arms and that's what I want for you and me, you know? So how long have you been with my Belle-Belle, hmm? 

BRYCE:			Um, how-- uh, for a while? 

MADISON:		Mmhmm. 

BRYCE:			Yeah, for uh, for a while. 

MADISON:		Yep. 

ZANE:			A while. 

MADISON:		Mmhmm. 

ZANE:			What a while. 

BRYCE:			Yeah. 

ZANE:		Okay, cool. Well, that settles it then. Madison, I'm gonna woo you back. 

BRYCE:			Great. Right up here would be great. 

WINTON:		Don't worry, every storm runs out of rain. It'll clear up. 

ZANE:			Wooh, yeah! Play some football.  Hmm, hello. 

WOMAN #4:		Zane Thomas! 

ZANE:			The one and only. You caught me. 

MARK:			Oh, man, I love all your music. 

ZANE:			Uh, yeah, doesn't everyone? 

WINTON (OS):		Wooh! Dude, are you playin' football with us? 

ZANE:			Well, I never pass up an opportunity-- 

WINTON:		Yes! 

ZANE:			To uh, shine for my Madison. Football. 

WINTON:		Nice. 

ZANE:			Yeah. 

BRYCE:			Alright, let's play. 

DAVID (OS):		Let's go. Now, Maddy, to the untrained eye, this may look like a simple 5 on 5 alumni football game. 

RACHEL (OS/ON):	Yeah, but it's an annual tradition. The rivalry actually goes way back. 

MADISON:		Wooh! 

MADISON:		Yah, wooh! 

DAVID:		I wouldn't get your hopes. Winton's team has never lost this game.  Like never ever. 

MADISON:		Go, Bryce! You can do it! 

WINTON:		Hut. 

RICK:			Go, buddy! 

KEVIN:			Oh! 

MARK:			Come back! 

WINTON:		Wooh! Another time, baby. Wooh, give it to me! Wooh. Yeah. Woo-hoo! Wooh! 16-2, baby. Wooh! 

DAVID (OS):		One minute left and if they score, they can win this. 

BRYCE:			Alright, let's go, hut-hut. 

RACHEL:		Go, Bryce! 

WINTON:		Ready? 

CROWD (OS) 		Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, 

WINTON:		Go. Come on, Zane, help me get it, come on. Get up, get up.  Get up, get up. Get up, get up. 

DAVID:			That's gotta hurt. 

REFEREE:		Once more! 

KEVIN:			Wooh! 

WINTON:		Keep your lips off my wife. Wooh! It's flag football, flag. 

MARK:			You okay, man? 

BRYCE:			Never better. 

MADISON:		Why is he not getting up? 

BRYCE:			Let me just have my spleen back in, I'll be good to go. 

RICK:			There's no U in quit. 

BRYCE:			Yeah, there definitely is. 

ZANE:		How many fingers am I holding up? Yeah, you're definitely sidelined agent man. Medic! 

MARK:			We cannot forfeit. 

MADISON (OS):	Hey, put me in, coach. 

ZANE:			Hey now, don't be too quick to judge, I've seen her in action. 

RICK:			Well, she did drink David under the table. 

KEVIN:			Don't worry. We won't hurt you, sweetheart. 

MADISON:		Funny, I was gonna say the same thing to you. 

BRYCE:			Have fun. 

RICK:			Alright, let's go. 

ZANE (OS):		Let's do this! Football. 

RICK (OS):		Let's go. 

WINTON:		Let's, go boys. Out there watch 'for slayer right here.  Let's go.  3, 2, 1.  Get down-- down there. Get Bryce's friends on 2. On 2, hut! 

ZANE (OS):		One Alabama, two Alabama, three Alabama! 

WINTON:		I love your PJs. 

MADISON (OS):	Yo, come on, Zane. Wooh! 

DAVID (OS):		You see it? 

ZANE:			Oh, my God! That was amazing. 

BRYCE:			What the-- 

ZANE:			What? 

RICK:			Hey, hey, my football! 

BRYCE:			I need some good news. 

SARAH:		We got it. 

BRYCE:			We got it? 

SARAH:		Yes, Madison's the leading lady. It took some coaxing, but Jeff's assistant let it slip. 

BRYCE:			Uh, paperwork? 

SARAH:		Will be emailed to you by tomorrow.  So I'm assuming I'll be an agent by Monday. Now, go enjoy your dance. 

BRYCE:			Alright, good work. We need to talk. 

MADISON:		The dance is in a couple hours, y'all, so hurry home and don't be late! 

WOMAN #4:		Oh. 

ZANE:			Hello. 

WOMAN #4:		Hi. 

BRYCE:			Uh, congratulations, studio called. You got the lead role. 

MADISON:		Wait, what? Oh my God, that's amazing.  You're amazing. 

BRYCE:			Madison. I don't know how to say this. I-- I'm having a whole bunch 			of mixed emotions. 

BRYCE:		Uh, uh, no, no, I-- We should never have-- I made a mistake, okay?  This is why agents don't date their clients. 

MADISON:		What are you talking about? This weekend's been perfect and we have-- 

BRYCE:			I just saw you kiss Zane. 

MADISON:		Okay, he kissed me. And did you see me push him away? 

BRYCE:			I mean the guy flew out here just to woo you. 

MADISON:		You're overthinking this. 

BRYCE:			Am I? 

MADISON:		Yeah, because this is exactly what happened with you and Charlotte,			except I didn't kiss back. 

BRYCE:		You know what? He's-- he's a famous musician and you're about to be a household-name actor. You guys-- you make sense. 

MADISON:		Do I get any say in this? We should be celebrating, Bryce. 

BRYCE:			I'll have Rachel or David drive you back to the hotel. 

MADISON:		Bryce! 

AGNES (OS):		Bryce. 

BRYCE:			Hi, Agnes, and-- and before you ask, I-- I have not read your script yet. 

AGNES:		Oh, an English teacher always knows when a student hasn't finished reading their assignment, but I forgive you. Jay Gatsby.  Good one, Bryce, very literary. 

BRYCE:			Yeah. 

AGNES:		Have fun tonight. You look like you could use it. 

BRYCE:			Thank you, Mrs. Miller. 

DAVID (OS):		Hey. 

MARK:			Hollywood's in the house, y'all. 

DAVID (OS/ON):	Keep it down. Now that I'm famous on TMZ, I'll be not wantin' the Pavarotti showin' up here, too. 

RACHEL:		It's paparazzi. 

DAVID:			I've heard it both ways. 

BRYCE:		Well, you guys certainly look dressed, you know ready for tonight's festivities. 

DAVID:			You don't look bad yourself for a guy who got dressed in his truck. 

BRYCE:			Thank you. 

MARK:			Let's just all stay out of trouble. 

DAVID (OS/ON):	Oh, relax. We can't be sent to the principal's office anymore. 

RICK:			Jail.  It's called "jail" now, David. 

BRYCE:			Not get in trouble, right.  Whoa! 

WINTON:		Relax, Dixon. I just wanted to thank you and Madison uh, who is surprisingly good at football. 

BRYCE (OS):		Yeah. 

WINTON:		Look, if y'all put Willow Valley on the map, tourists would be floodin' in  and that's gonna do wonders for all the businesses locally. 

BRYCE:			No, Winton, it is uh, my pleasure. 

WINTON:		Oh, you know, I'd like to thank Madison, personally. And Zane. Is uh, he comin' tonight, 'cause you know, I need a selfie.  We opened up the dance, so the entire community can partake in this special evening. 

BRYCE:			Of course. 

WINTON:		Well, uh, I gotta go. Duty calls.  Let me be the first to welcome everybody to the 15-year high school reunion. Wooh! Yes, it's gonna be an excitin' night, so dance it up. Tie one on and go Eagles! 

RICK:			Hell yeah, go Eagles! 

BRYCE:		Alright, I'm gonna go to the bar. Can I get anybody anything?  Since my client is here, I can-- 

RACHEL:		Client? 

BRYCE:			I could expense the whole weekend. 

RACHEL:		Okay. 

DAVID:			Really? Then make mine a triple. 

BRYCE (OS):		You got it. 

MAN #6 (OS):		Oh my God! Zane Thomas! 

MAN #7:		Hi, Zane. 

ZANE (Overlapping):	Thank you, thank you. 

MAN #7:		Oh my God. 

WINTON:		Glad you made it. 

ZANE:			Phew! Yeah, well, you know, I made it for love. 

WINTON:		True. That's uh-- that's great. 

ZANE:			Listen, I gotta catch a jet back to New York in about an hour, but-- 

WINTON:		Yeah. 

ZANE:			...you think you could do me a little favor beforehand? 

WINTON:		I got you. 

ZANE:			Thank you, mate. 

WINTON:		Phew. 

BRYCE:			Excuse me. 

DAVID (OS):		Go get her, Dixie. 

BRYCE:			Wasn't sure you were gonna make it. Here. 

MADISON:		I promised you a dance. 

BRYCE (OS):		Yeah, yeah. Yes, you did. 

MADISON:		Here's to promises, making and keeping them. 

BRYCE:			And to apologies. 

BRYCE:			To makin' them and accepting them. Oh yeah. What? 

MADISON:		Wait. Wait, wait, that's-- that's not a joke? 

RACHEL:		Oh no, he wasn't kidding around. 

MADISON:		You meant to look like that? 

BRYCE (OS):		Wow, rude. First of all, not that bad, okay? And secondly, not all of us have uh, you know, personal shoppers and stylists. 

MADISON:		Oh, yet no one else looks like that. 

BRYCE:			You know what? Uh, Rachel didn't seem to mind. 

RACHEL:		Well, clearly, I thought it was what's on the inside  that counts. 

BRYCE:			Okay, uh, that's not me anymore, so thanks. 

MADISON:		Well, you take the boy out of Bama, you can't take the Bama out of the boy. 

BRYCE:			Bama, is it? 

MADISON:		Hmm, hmm. Hmm. Can we do something about this? 

DAVID:			Ugh. 

MARK:		There's one thing I've learned is that people really only change on the outside. 

CHARLOTTE (OS):	Well, I do declare. 

BRYCE:			Ugh, Charlotte, great. 

CHARLOTTE:		Here's the famous couple I saw on the news. 

RACHEL:		We used to call them "Charlotte and the MNEs." 

CHARLOTTE:		I wonder who tipped the reporters up. 

MADISON:		Yeah, I wonder. 

CHARLOTTE:		Oh, bless your heart. You really are precious, aren't you? And Bryce, I meant to ask how are your ribs.  Still tender from the tackle? 

BRYCE:			Doing just fine. 

CHARLOTTE:		Felt good.  Guess I shouldn't let our little secret slip out to Winton. 

BRYCE:			Yeah, great. I'm so sorry about that. 

WINTON:		Oh! Ah! I love my city and my people. Wow! God, you guys are great. What a fantastic night. I hope you'll have a time of y'all's lives, right?  Before we announce the winner of tonight's contest uh, my main man Zane asked to say a few words.  So let's hear it for Zane Thomas!  Yes! Come on, Zane, go! Wooh! 

WINTON:		Oh. 

ZANE:		Good night, everyone. This guy. Thank you. Thank you so much.  And thank you, you're doin' a great job, honey. I'm honored to be here with you all tonight  celebrating a-- the uh--  A-- a-- a passage of time. 

ZANE:		That's right folks, 'cause you are all like a fine, fine wine and I think it's time to get this party uncorked. what do you say? Are you ready to have your minds blown, huh? I'm ready to blow your mind!  But before we get into it, I'd just like to uh, invite up on stage someone very dear to me. She is the yin to my yang, the Yoko to my Ono. Would you please help me ring in this reunion for none other than Miss Madison Belle, everyone! 

MADISON:		What is he doing? 

ZANE:		I said, "Miss Madison Belle". Yeah. She's a little shy, folks. Come on, let's help her out. Madison, Madison, Madison. 

CROWD (OS): 		Madison, Madison, Madison. 

ZANE:			Yeah, come on. 

MADISON:		Yeah, fine. 

CROWD (OS): 		Madison, Madison, Madison, Madison, Madison. 

ZANE (OS):		Good on you, Madison. 

MADISON:		What are you doin'? 

ZANE:		Good job for bein' a good sport. She's a good sport. Yeah, just go with it, it's gonna be fun. Grab a guitar.  Now, most of you would recognize Madison from her TV shows and her movies, but-- But she's also a bit of a songbird, too. Now, I have to admit I have heard a few of these Alabama stereotypes. 

CROWD (OS):		Ooh! 

ZANE:		Oh, okay, sorry. But what I have found in my short time here has surprised me. I wanna ask you a question, though. If you take away the enchanting Main Street, and historic buildings and clear lakes, do you know what you'd have left? 

MEMBER 1 (OS):	Mississippi! 

ZANE:			Jokester. No, love. You'd still have love. 

RICK:			You look like you could really use a drink, Dixie. 

BRYCE:		Yeah, you know what, um--  I think I'd get on the rocks. Thanks, man. Rachel, may I have this dance? 

RACHEL:		Of course. 

BRYCE:			This is just like prom. 

RACHEL:		Yeah, but someone's learned a few new dance moves. 

BRYCE:			Hmm, what a joke. 

MADISON (Singing):	? Mm, I can't forget the glamor ? ? Your eyes held a tender light ?  ? So is everything okay with Madison?  ? And stars fell on Alabama ? ? Last night ? 

ZANE:			Hoo-hoo! 

BRYCE:			Is everything okay with you and Rick? 

RACHEL:		He makes me happy. 

BRYCE:			Honestly, I'm really happy about you. 

RACHEL:		Thank you. 

BRYCE:			How did you know that he was the one? 

RACHEL:		I felt it in my heart. 

BRYCE:			In your heart? 

RACHEL:		Yeah. How is it that you still haven't learnt to listen? 

ZANE (Singing):	? Last night ?  One more time, boys. 

RACHEL:		Your heart knows things that your mind can't explain.  Madison is something special. 

RICK:			Dixie, I do believe that beautiful lady you're dancing with is my wife. 

BRYCE:			Thank you. Thank you for the dance. 

RICK:			Hey. 

RACHEL: 		Hey. 

RICK:			I almost traded you in for a Pink Lady. 

RACHEL:		How dare you? 

RICK:			Yep. 

RACHEL:		You would never. 

RICK:			I almost did it. I almost did it. 
RACHEL:		I don't believe you. 

ZANE(Singing):	? We lived our little drama ? ? We kissed in a field of white ? ? And stars fell on Alabama ? ? Tonight ? 

MADISON		? We lived our little drama ? ? We kissed in a field of white ? ? And stars fell on Alabama ? ? Tonight ? 

ZANE:			Yeah. Wooh, yeah! Madison, everyone. 

WINTON:		Ladies and gentlemen, it is that time of the evening to present our award for tonight. So I would like to welcome up my lovely wife Charlotte. 

CHARLOTTE:		Thank you, honey, Mr. Mayor. As your former homecoming queen and head cheerleader, I have the distinct pleasure of announcing the best Main Street movie display. The winner is-- 

ZANE:		Sorry, before you announce the winner of whatever you're doing, there's something that I need to say or rather to ask. Now, let's not kid ourselves, folks. I'm not here for the arts and crafts. I'm here for Miss-- for Miss Madison belle. That's right. 

CROWD MEMBER 2:	One more song. 

CROWD (OS): 		One more song. One more song. 

ZANE (Overlapping):	No, no, no, no, no. I don't want Madison to sing another song. I want her here by my side. Now, most of you probably know this from the grocery store rags, but Madison and I,  we used to be a bit of a thing. And I think you can all agree we've made some sweet, sweet music for y'all tonight, huh? 

RICK:			Hey! 

ZANE:			I never want that to end. So, Madison-- 

MADISON (OS):	Zane. 

ZANE:			Would you do me the honor? 

BRYCE:			Madison, wait! 

ZANE:			That didn't go as planned, did it? Uh, well. 

BRYCE:			Hey, guys, guys, so where did Madison go? 

RICK:		Oh, I knew it today is the day. Can't slip out of this one unscathed, Dixie. Tell us the truth. 

BRYCE:			Alright, look, I-- I-- 

MARK:			Wait, I gotta say something first. 

DAVID:		Good Lord, please don't tell me you were the one puttin' ham on your shoulder all these years. 

BRYCE:			Come on, guys. 

MARK (OS):		Ellie and I are separated. A few months now. I thought we could work through it, but we can't. 

BRYCE:			I'm sorry, buddy. 

DAVID:			You know, I've been through that. Why didn't you tell me? 

MARK:			Honestly? I felt like a failure. I mean if I can't make my marriage work, 			I couldn't be good at anything. 

RICK:			Mark, come on. 

MARK (OS/ON):	Uh, then I realized that I-- I'd given it my all, but in the end, Ellie and I just aren't right for each other. We're gonna keep it civil for the kids. Make sure that they know that their parents love them more than anything-- 

BRYCE:		Hey, you are a good man, Mark. All of you are. And uh, well, I think that now I need to go try and be a good man, too. Um, hi. Yeah uh, it's been a pretty interesting evening. And I'm sure that you guys have uh,  quite a few questions like-- 

KEVIN:			Why did Zane Thomas propose to your girlfriend? 

BRYCE:		Yeah, exactly. Like-- like that. Um... ...well, unfortunately the answer to that one is uh, is-- is pretty simple. I lied. Yeah, and-- and um, I owe all you guys a big apology and-- And Madison, too, for draggin' her into this. Look, I-- I-- I only came out here to impress everyone. I mean I'm livin' the LA dream! Yeah, exactly. You know, but I-- I've realized that what's the most important is the people around you. You know, your friends and-- and your family. In my whole life, I-- I-- I've just focused on my career. You know, I wasn't gonna let anything derail my success,  you know? Eyes on the prize. But a um, you know, a--a wise friend recently told me that when you meet the right person, your heart will let you know. And there isn't anything that you wouldn't sacrificefor them. And these past few days have taught me that that's exactly how I feel about Madison. So, Madison-- 

BRYCE:		Wherever you are um, I just wanted to say... ...I'm honored... that you came down here with me, and I have loved every moment that we've spent together, and I'm sorry to you and uh... ...to everyone. Well, well uh, no uh, not to Zane.  You know, g--  Growin' up I-- I-- I just-- I dreamt of living in California and I couldn't wait to get out of here.  But I really--  I really should have paid attention to the lessons that my Alabama family  had to teach me. Like to be a good husband, and father, and to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, and just the golden rule, to treat others the way that you want to be treated. Kevin, you're a grown-ass man, alright? Enough with the ham. And by the way, Winton. You really are a good mayor. Great things really are happening here in Willow Valley. I mean that laughter and-- and--and-- and the loyalty, I-- I've seen this weekend-- I just realized that that's far more valuable than heck both my Ferraris and frankly anything that money can buy. 

WINTON:		Hmm. 

CHARLOTTE:		He has two Ferraris. 

BRYCE:		This weekend, I-- I saw the real true Willow Valley for the first time. And-- and look, guys, I just-- I just hope that-- You know, one day you can forgive me. 

DAVID (OS):		Dixie, we forgive you. Set the record straight. Are you and Madison dating? 

MADISON:		Yes. We are. 

BRYCE:			For two days. 

AGNES (OS/ON):	Well, this has been touchin' and all, but I'm still waitin' to hear who won the Main Street decorating contest? 

MADISON:		Uh, and the winner is... 

BRYCE 			...Casablanca! 

MADISON:		...Casablanca! Now, Bryce, kiss me.  Kiss me as if it were the last time. 

BRYCE:			You know uh, you really are gonna need to get a new agent now. 

MADISON:		Yeah, anyone except Larry. 

BRYCE:			I have just the person.
