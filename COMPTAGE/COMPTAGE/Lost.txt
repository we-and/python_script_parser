(LOST & FOUND)



ANDY	Most people can hold their breath for about 30 seconds. I can hold mine for 99.

ANNOUNCER	And Andy Walton takes an early lead against the lane number two swimmer, Clayton Stone.


ANDY	See, 99 seconds is exactly how long I needed to win the district championship in the 200 meter freestyle, with Claire Broman, the girl of my dreams, in the stands.

ANNOUNCER	It's Andy Walton and Clayton Stone neck and neck through today.

MAN	Yeah, Clayton!

MARK	Come on, Andy, come on. 


ANNOUNCER	Ladies and gentlemen, Walton and Stone are just one stroke apart as we near the end of the 200 meters. 

ANDY	I was on the brink of a college scholarship and a whole new life.

ANNOUNCER	Clayton Stone seizes the championship by one stroke from Andy Walton!

ANDY	But in 99 seconds, all my dreams came to a crashing end. Things pretty much went straight downhill after that.  Hey, sorry I'm late.

CLAIRE	Hey, sucks about the race. 

RYAN	Okay, loser, whatever. You're gonna hook us up, right?

ANDY	Party at your place after, right?

RYAN	Sure.

ANDY	Okay. Meet me outside in 60 seconds. That was awesome. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Change of plans.

GROCERY S. MANAGER	That kid right there in the hat.

RYAN	Let's go, let's go, come on, get in!

ANDY	Hey!

CLAIRE	Don't be an ass, Ryan! Open the door!

GIRL	Go, go, go, let's go!

RYAN	Hey, thanks for the score, loser!

ANDY	Truth be told, this wasn't the first time I'd gotten busted. It was the third this month. Ah, man, I was in for it.

JIM	You okay?

SALLY	Yeah. The store's not pressing charges, provided it never happens again.

JIM	I can guarantee that. You jeopardize your mom's job, not to mention getting me pulled off the line, which you well know this family cannot afford right now.  You need to learn your place, Andy.

ANDY	I don't have a place. 

JIM	It's time.

SALLY	What? No. After this?

JIM	Maybe Mark can go too. I don't know. 

SALLY	No, it's out of the question.

ANDY	What's out of the question?

JIM	You're gonna go see your Uncle Trent.

SALLY	Jim, you can't just make this call.

ANDY	Who is Uncle Trent?

JIM	Trent, pick up. I know you're there. Come on, man, we need to talk. It's about Andy. 

ANDY	What's this? Huh. "To my son, Jim." What?

MARK	What are you doing with my backpack? It's got all my tools in perfect order. 

ANDY	Not anymore. Go back to bed.

MARK	Where are you going?

ANDY	They think that they can send me to stay with someone that I've never even met. I mean, do you even know who this guy is? Have you seen any pictures of this Uncle Trent? It doesn't make any sense. Screw that. I can hitchhike a hundred miles before they even notice. Be good.


   
MARK	No, Andy, you can't.

ANDY	Mark, quiet, okay?

MARK	No. I'm tougher than I look. I'll yell.

ANDY	Don't yell, don't yell.

MARK	Mom! Dad! Andy's running away!

SALLY	Andy! Stay right there! I'm coming down.

ANDY	Thanks.

MARK	You're welcome.

ANDY	So there I was, leaving a town and a school that didn't want me and a family that didn't seem to want me either.

ANDY	Little did I know the biggest race of my life was just around the corner.

SALLY	Is that him?

JIM	Yep, sure is.

TRENT	Brought you some fish.

MARK	Can I hold it?

TRENT	Yeah, well, it's heavy.

MARK	Disgusting!

TRENT	Hello, Andy.

ANDY	Hello, Uncle Whoever-You-Are.

TRENT	Trent. Your Uncle Trent.

SALLY	Do you think you can manage both boys for the weekend?

TRENT	Okay.

MARK	Yes!

ANDY	What? No! There is no way!

SALLY	Mark has a serious ear condition. He needs to avoid water at all costs.

TRENT	So he can't swim at all?

SALLY	No.

ANDY	It is bad enough I gotta be trapped on this island. You're gonna stick me with Mark too?

JIM	Hey, come on.

ANDY	What?

JIM	Listen to me. I know you're pissed at me. I want you to take care of yourself and make sure you watch over Mark, okay?

SALLY	Promise me you will wear this all day, every day, and never, ever take it off.

TRENT	You know this is a mistake.

MARK	Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! I love you!

TRENT	Okay, jump out and tie us off, will you? Okay, boys... there's only one rule on this island. That is any time you go anywhere near the water, wear a vest. When the currents are bad, you'll feel like you're being flushed down the toilet.

MARK	Walton Island? Is that us?

TRENT	Once upon a time.

ANDY	Why are they taking it down?

TRENT	Hey! What are you doing? We got two months.

MARK	So they're changing the name of our island?

ANDY	You can do that?

TRENT	Pay off the right people, you can do anything. Come on, let's take a picture. Keep it up.

ANDY	That's the way we should've come. Who is that?

TRENT	Smile.

MARK	Wicked! Is there a town?

TRENT	Yep, about a mile away.

ANDY	Hey, what's that over there on the west side?

TRENT	Nothing.

ANDY	What do you mean, nothing? You've lived on this island your whole life. You don't know what that is?

TRENT	I just told you what it is. It's nothing. Stash your gear, and when I get back, I wanna show you how to wrap some fish guts. Twenty.

MARK	Is this bad?

TRENT	Yeah.

ANDY	I'm all in. Flush.

TRENT	Not good enough.

MARK	Oh, busted.

ANDY	Unbelievable.

TRENT	I'll show you how to make one, if you want. You write a little note, shove it in there with the ship, and you launch it out to sea.

ANDY	Let me get this straight. You just write these little letters, build these little ships and throw 'em all away?

TRENT	Gotta do something with these bottles, don't I?

ANDY	So enlighten me, Trent, since this whole island is named after us, we probably weren't always broke like we are now.

TRENT	Bingo. You win. We were rich.

ANDY	You're gonna have to elaborate 'cause I only know what it's like to grow up poor. I mean, you and my dad were just, I don't know, go out to restaurants and eat every night sort of rich? Like what?

TRENT	No, no, not like that. Dynasty rich. The kind of wealth that generations and generations of families could live off of. This was our island.

ANDY	So what happened?

TRENT	Time for bed.

ANDY	Come on, what happened?

TRENT	I don't know. No one knows. They found my father's boat drifting and, uh... I never saw him again.

ANDY	You're saying that we, the Walton family, we used to have millions, and now it's gone? And you, you've never even bothered to look for it.

TRENT	Yeah, I did. Of course I did.

ANDY	Well, then where's the money?

TRENT	It's here. Somewhere. I don't know. Had to let it go.

ANDY	Are you serious?

TRENT	Yeah. And you gotta let it go, kid.

MARK	Don't worry. He'll be back, eventually.

TRENT	Ever see a compass lock?

MARK	Have I ever? Watch and learn. So was Grandpa really a millionaire?

TRENT	He was a lot more than that. He was a code breaker during World War II. He loved his secrets. Made the most amazing treasure hunts for us on our birthday. I remember the last big hunt. We actually got to use a real decoder from the war. The last hunt, it took us three days to find our presents. Three whole days.

MARK	Done.

ANDY	Stupid uncle. Stupid!

MAN	Move, and I put a hole in you.

ANDY	Look, I'm sorry.

MAN	I said don't move! On your knees. And put your hands were I can see 'em. What's your name, boy?

ANDY	Look, just chill, all right?

MAN	Name!

ANDY	I'm Andrew Walton. I'm Trent Walton's nephew. The guy who owns the tackle shop!

MAN	I know who he is, and now I know who you are. You ain't the first Walton to go after your granddaddy's treasure. But I catch you again, I'll make sure you're the last.

ANDY	Yeah, whatever, man.

MARK	Have a nice nature walk?

ANDY	It's here. He just didn't know where to look for it.

MARK	Probably because he never found Grandpa's treasure map.

ANDY	What'd you say?

MARK	Uncle Trent told me all about it while you were gone.

ANDY	Why are you wearing your life preserver?

MARK	'Cause Mom told me to. Plus it's cozy.

ANDY	What exactly did Trent tell you, Mark?

MARK	Just that Grandpa liked secrets. He would make Dad and Uncle Trent go on treasure hunts to find their presents.

ANDY	It's all starting to make sense. He wanted them to go on one last hunt together.

MARK	So we're going on the hunt instead?

ANDY	Not we. Me.

MARK	Ah, come on. Every Don Quixote needs a Sancho Panza.

ANDY	You are such a nerd.

MARK	Uncle Trent says it's as good as gone anyways.

ANDY	Uncle Trent had his chance, okay? But it is my turn now, and I'm not gonna be poor for the rest of my life. The old man's fortune is real. It's on this island and I'm gonna find it. "To my son, Jim. Unfair and unkind that soon we must part, but beginnings are endings, and endings are beginnings. Be ready, for at these crossroads, I await discovery. Seek your reward where the gift of time awaits." Gift of time? The gift of time.

TRENT	What are you doing?

ANDY	You scared me.

TRENT	It's late, man, go to bed. We got a big day tomorrow.

ANDY	Ugh. Oh, that's disgusting. You're disgusting.

MARK	You're disgusting.

ANDY	You're disgusting. Hello. Maybe this island's not so bad after all. Turn around, turn around. Just gotta set up a little accidental meet and greet. A little "Hey, how are you?"

MARK	Why don't you just go talk to her?

ANDY	Look, you don't even like women, okay? You probably never will, so...

MARK	I like women.

ANDY	Yeah?

MARK	I just don't see what the big deal is. Just ask her to get ice cream or something. Ice cream? Are you—Everybody loves ice cream.

ANDY	Okay, if you need to know something, you need to know that chicks don't like ice cream.

MARK	Hey!

ANDY	Claire?

CLAIRE	So what are you doing here?

ANDY	Oh, uh, yeah, easy. I got busted, so my parents sent me to stay with my uncle. I mean, do you remember? I stole beer for your boyfriend, and you let me with a security guard's knee in my back. It was awesome.

MARK	We just got here yesterday. Do you know the island pretty good?

CLAIRE	Yeah, well, my dad has a house out here, so I'm kinda stuck here all summer. You looking for something?

MARK	Hidden treasure.

CLAIRE	Hidden what?

ANDY	Treasures, you know. Cool, cool spots on the island.

CLAIRE	Well, there's a general store in town. Pretty good ice cream.

ANDY	Yeah, yeah, I love-- I love ice cream. I can eat ice cream all day.

CLAIRE	All right, see you boys later.

ANDY	Okay.

MARK	"I love ice cream. I could eat ice cream all day."

ANDY	Hidden treasure, lost fortune, where to begin? All I had was a rusty pocket watch and Mark. We decided to kill two birds with one stone. Get a little ice cream and explore Walton Island. The whole place looked like it was going under. Guess we weren't the only ones who'd lost everything.

ANDY	Are you stalking me?

CLAIRE	It's an island. Don't flatter yourself.

ESTHER	Made up your mind yet?

CLAIRE	Mint chip, please. Double scoop.

ESTHER	You boys are Waltons, ain't you? Got your grandfather's eyes.

ANDY	You knew him?

ESTHER	Everyone knew him, hon. If he was with us, we could stay in peace. Instead, we have to start over.

CLAIRE	How much for the ice cream?

ESTHER	That's $10,000. But don't worry, Miss Broman. Your father can afford it.

ANDY	Actually, I'm buying.

ESTHER	In that case, it's on the house.

CLAIRE	Thanks.

ANDY	What are you getting?

BROMAN	Hello, Trent. I hear you found yourself some cheap labor.

TRENT	I got to the end of summer. What are you doing here?

BROMAN	Yes, well, that was the old deal. This one has a 10% bonus if you move out by the end of the month.

TRENT	How 'bout you go to hell?

BROMAN	Oh, Trent, Trent, Trent. When are you going to learn? There's no future in this bait and tackle shop. In a year, this island will be the premier tourist spot for miles around. Tell you what. I'm willing to sweeten the deal. We're planning on building a gift store here, and I'm willing to let you run it for, say, 5% of net profit? Heck, you could sell quite a lot of your ships in a bottle.

TRENT	I think I can make this better.

BROMAN	Oh?

TRENT	This is my father's island. Walton Island.

BROMAN	Not for long.

ANDY	My plan was evolving. Find the treasure, save the island. Save the island, get the girl. All those things were looking really good and totally, completely impossible. How was I ever gonna get a girl like that?!

MARK	Hey, what are those?

CLAIRE	That's the West Forest. Your uncle hasn't told you much, has he? Those crosses are for the nine people who vanished there.

ANDY	What? Come on.

CLAIRE	Yeah.

MARK	Are they buried there?

CLAIRE	No. They were never found. People have seen some strange things here. Ghosts.

ANDY	A haunted forest? Oh, cool. Finally something fun to do.

CLAIRE	No! No way! Mark, come on, stop!

ANDY	Oh, come on, Claire. They're just ghost stories.

CLAIRE	There's nine stakes in the ground for a reason. I'm not trying to be ten. You better get him out of there.

ANDY	Mark. Mark! Mark, come on, man. Where are you? Mark!

MARK	Andy! Andy, help!

ANDY	Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark, where are you? Oh, dude. Dude! Don't do that.

MARK	Where's your girlfriend?

ANDY	She's not my girlfriend. Come on, let's go.

MARK	You know, if I was burying a treasure, this is where I'd put it.

ANDY	No, it's gotta have something to do with time, like a watch or a clock, maybe.

MARK	You don't bury treasure in a clock.

ANDY	No, numb nuts. It's a metaphor. Ohh!

MARK	Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy, are you okay?

ANDY	Yeah. I think so. Oh, God! Oh, God!

MARK	Andy, what do you want me to do?

ANDY	Go get Trent! Go get Uncle Trent. Hurry!

MARK	Okay, okay.

ANDY	Come on, Mark, where are you? Come on. "Spooky", she said. "Don't go in there," she said.

TRENT	Andy? Andy, where are you?

ANDY	Uncle Trent? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, I'm down here!

TRENT	I got ya. All right, all right, hold on, I'm coming.

ANDY	Ah, thank God, thank God.

TRENT	You wanna tell me why you went into the West Forest?

ANDY	Ask Mark. He's the one who went in.

MARK	Ask Andy. He's the one who thinks he can find Grandpa's treasure. And Claire thinks there's ghosts.

TRENT	How old are you? Ghosts? You haven't listened to a thing I said since you been here, have you? Have you? You think I just talk to hear myself speak? I told you not to go into the forest. There's nothing in there, and there is nothing. There's not treasure.There's not ghosts. Don't go in. Am I clear? I'm not gonna say this again.

MARK	If you want Claire to like you back, maybe you should grow one of your claws bigger.

ANDY	Dude! Wait, what?

MARK	Well that's what these guys do. You see, the boy lobster grows one claw bigger than the other, not even to hunt or anything. It's really just to impress the girl lobster. It's true.

ANDY	You know the most random crap, you know that?

MARK	It's not crap. You're just jealous 'cause you don't—

ANDY	Hey! Mark, it's okay.

MARK	Andy!

BROMAN	Once they get ahold of you like that, they never let go. Here, let's have a look. Oh, you'll survive. Rinse that with cold water and put a compress on it. You'll be fine.

ANDY	Thank you. I didn't know what to do.

BROMAN	Well, next time you will. There are two kinds of creatures in this world: the ones that pick a fight, and the ones that finish it. This one picked wrong. John Broman. Andrew Walton. Oh, are you any relation to Richard Walton? Yeah, yeah, he was my grandfather. You knew him? No, no, I wish I had. I'm a great admirer of his. That's why I bought his house. Oh, you, uh, you didn't know?

ANDY	No.

BROMAN	Hmm. I tell you what. Why don't you bring the rest of these over, and I'll have my chef cook us a nice dinner tonight. We'll give you a tour. What do you say?

ANDY	Sure.

BROMAN	You're a finisher, aren't you, Andrew?

ANDY	I think so.

BROMAN	Don't think so. Know so. I never pick wrong. So, uh, shall we say about eight?

ANDY	Yeah.

TRENT	Hey. You sure that's her style?

ANDY	Her dad invited me out tonight, so...

TRENT	Look, I've known John Broman a long time, and he's a snake.

ANDY	Look, I got my reasons for going.

TRENT	I bet you do. Hey. Good luck, kid.

ANDY	Thanks. Luck? Yeah. Never had much of that. But what I did have was a bag full of lobsters, and I was gonna use it to get some answers. If this Broman guy, that everybody hates, lives my grandfather's house, and he's interested in me? No way that's a coincidence. If there were answers, they were here. They just had to be.

BROMAN	Looking for something?

ANDY	I-- I was just admiring your clock.

BROMAN	Mm.

ANDY	I brought lobster.

BROMAN	Oh, splendid. Mildred!

MILDRED	Yes, sir.

BROMAN	Have the chef prepare these for us, will you, please?

MILDRED	Right away.

ANDY	When you said you were living in my grandfather's house, I just thought it was a normal house. This is beautiful.

BROMAN	Yes, yes, we're very fond of it. It's like a home away from home. Right this way.

ANDY	Okay.

BROMAN	So how are you enjoying your time on the island so far? Have you had a chance to do any exploring?

ANDY	Ah, you know, a little.

BROMAN	I presume you've heard of your grandfather's lost fortune.

ANDY	No, I haven't.

BROMAN	Really? My dear boy, it's legendary. You mean to tell me your parents never told you about it?

ANDY	Mm-mm.

BROMAN	Hmm. There was once a pirate named William Kidd back in the 17th century, and apparently before he died, Kidd buried almost $10 million in gold somewhere in Long Island. Your grandfather's hidden treasure is estimated to be twice that. Being Richard Walton's grandson, seems to me that you're the natural heir. Unfortunately, I'm completely preoccupied with developing this island, or else I'd look for it myself. I'll tell you what. If you discover anything on my island, it's all yours. It would appear you have a treasure hunt ahead of you. Hello? Yes, hold on. I'm so sorry. I have to take this call. It's rather private.

ANDY	Oh, yeah, sure.

CLAIRE	Glad to see you made it out of the forest alive.

ANDY	Oh, you know what? Here. Got you something. So you don't have to put up with that ice cream lady's attitude next time you need a fix.

CLAIRE	Thanks.

ANDY	So my dad and Trent grew up here. Crazy.

CLAIRE	I can't believe they're tearing it down.

ANDY	What?

CLAIRE		18th fairway is going right through here. That's your grandfather right there. Breaks my heart. I love this house. Hey, before they tear it down, I have something to show you. This is my favorite room in the house.

ANDY	Do you play? "Authentic World War II Cipher Decoder used by U.S. Navy Intelligence."

CLAIRE	My dad's prize possession. Basically useless though. Try opening it. Yeah, the only way is with a key. Your grandfather's design. Hardly see my dad all year, and then he forces me to come to this island every summer just so he can sit in his office and ignore me.

ANDY	Your parents, I mean, did they...

CLAIRE	When they split?

ANDY	Mm.

CLAIRE	Long time ago. My mom got remarried, new stepkids, new life.

ANDY	Yeah, I get it. Sometimes it's lonely when it feels like—

CLAIRE	Nothing fits?

ANDY	At least you don't have parents breathing down your neck. And plus, you're rich. I would trade you in a second.

CLAIRE	Uh, no, be careful what you wish for. You know, no disrespect or anything, but don't front like you have it rough, okay? You have money. You can pretty much fit anywhere. Your family was wealthy once too. That house? It all could've been yours until Trent lost it to my dad in a card game.

ANDY	That's impossible.

MARK	I'm having the best time ever. I'm learning how to catch lobster, play poker. Please, can I stay, Dad? I'll do anything. Please?

JIM	Okay, hey. Okay, buddy, you can stay. Sounds like you're having fun. No more poker! Promise. Put Uncle Trent on the phone.

MARK	Yes! Thank you! Love you, Dad, bye!

TRENT	Yeah?

JIM	Did you do it yet?

TRENT	I'm working on it.

JIM	How about you stop working on it, Trent, and you actually do it? That was the deal.

TRENT	No, that was your deal, not mine.

JIM	You didn't agree to anything. How 'bout just once you don't have to agree and negotiate? You just take responsibility for something. That would be such a miracle in my little life, Trent, if you just took responsibility for something other than wiping your own butt. I've been taking after you your whole life. It must be nice to just sort of like play footsie with the wind. What are you teaching 'em poker for anyway, hmm? No more gambling.

MARK	What's wrong?

TRENT	Nothing. Everything's peachy.

JIM	That was super funny, Trent.

ANDY	I probably should've left well enough alone and kept on riding, but time wasn't on my side, and I needed answers. These guys were either guarding something or looking for something. Either way, I wasn't alone.

MAN	Hey! Stop!

ANDY	This wasn't just a treasure hunt anymore. This was a race. It was time to get serious. Where's Uncle Trent? A second gold pocket watch?Maybe my luck was changing after all. "To my son, Trent. Here I am revealed after the day is done and the burning sun sets. Yesterday and tomorrow destined to be your guide, ever and always the constant of constants."

TRENT	Hey. What are you doing? It's all I have left of my father.

ANDY	Look, Trent, there are people in the West Forest. Okay, we need to do something.

TRENT	You went back in that forest?

ANDY	One of them took a shot at me. They're looking for something, Trent.

TRENT	You go back in that forest again, consider yourself locked in your room the rest of the sum—

ANDY	Are you not listening to me? They're gonna tear our family home to the ground! And we still got time, but we are running out.

TRENT	Enough! It is over. I had told you that already. Stop! You know what? Go to your room.

ANDY	Go to my room. Who do you think you are, my father? Or just some guy who sucks at playing cards? So it's true.

TRENT	Don't go there, kid.

ANDY	Try me.

TRENT	Yeah? You know what happens when, um, you don't pay your property taxes? Hmm? The government seizes everything. And my father, your grandfather, in his infinite genius, decided to stash his money, but he forgot to tell anyone where it was, so eventually all we had left on this whole island was that house. And they were coming for that. That was just a matter of time. So yes... I walked into that poker game with Broman because it was my last and only play. And I lost. I lost everything. Do you know why you're here? This.

ANDY	What is this? What is this? Do you think I ditched my life to build a ship in a bottle with some deadbeat, broke down alcoholic uncle that I have never met?

TRENT	Would you listen to me for one sec—

ANDY	Okay, you know what? Fine, let's do this. Do we just write some little fortune cookie note and toss it in the ocean, or is that just your excuse... to empty another bottle? Go away! Get in, get in. Close the door.

MARK	He told you not to touch that.

ANDY	No, this is Dad's. I stole it before we left.

MARK	My God, you're gonna get into so much trouble.

ANDY	What do you think I'm in now, Mark?

MARK	It looks exactly like the other one.

ANDY	Yeah, I know. The inscriptions and everything.

MARK	"To my son, Jim.  Unfair and unkind that soon we must part. But beginnings are endings, and endings are beginnings. Be ready, for at these crossroads, I await discovery. Seek your reward where the gift of time awaits."

ANDY	Where do endings and beginnings meet?

MARK	Midnight! The beginning of a new day meets the ending of the last. What did the other pocket watch say?

ANDY	Something, um... about a guide after sunset, like a sunset guide.

MARK	That's easy. There's only one constant guide after sunset.

ANDY	So what is it?

MARK	I know something you don't.

ANDY	Come on, tell me, you little twerp.

MARK	No, you said you were going on this hunt, not me. You're Don Quixote, and you don't need a Sancho Panza.

ANDY	Okay, w-w-wait, wait, wait, wait. We're going on the hunt together.

MARK	Promise?

ANDY	Would I lie to you... Sancho?

MARK	The North Star! The only thing in the night sky that never, ever moves.

ANDY	Holy ship in a bottle, I think you're right. Okay, let's go.

MARK	Okay.

ANDY	You're sure that's the North Star, right?

MARK	Yeah, that's it.

ANDY	Okay.

MARK	But what do we do now?

ANDY	I don't know. I guess we wait. And it's... midnight.

MARK	Maybe your watch is a little fast. Andy, what's past the stars?

ANDY	Past the stars? I don't know, Mark. I have a hard enough time figuring out life down here. Hey, hey, wake up. We gotta get back.

MARK	I don't see why you're so mad.

ANDY	Well, obviously one of us was wrong, and I'm pretty sure midnight was right, so...

MARK	The North Star was right too. Maybe we were just in the wrong place.

ANDY	Unless it has nothing to do with the North Star, and I'm just wasting my time with you, Sancho.

BROMAN	I just need three more days. Yes, I tried the tactical approach, but there are always more... convincing measures. He'll leave, and they'll all follow. Trust me. We can break ground by the end of the month.

CLAIRE	Wanna play some cards?

BROMAN	Hold on one second. Not now, darling. I'm right in the middle of something. We will be on time and on schedule.

ANDY	Secrets, lies, and dead ends. Even the stars were against me. We were getting back pretty late, but as long as Trent wasn't an early riser, we'd be in the clear. No such luck.

TRENT	Well, thank God.

ANDY	What the heck?

TRENT	You really think that you could stay out all night without saying anything? You too.

MARK	Me?

CLAIRE	Sucks about your ride. For what it's worth, I'd take a bike over an Escalade any day. Look, I just came by to say that... I'm sorry. I thought you knew about the poker game.

ANDY	Wanna come out with Mark and I tonight? Bonfire on the beach, sing Kumbaya. I got something for you.

CLAIRE	So what do you got for me?

ANDY	Ah. Close your eyes.

CLAIRE	Okay.

ANDY	Okay. I saw youn checking this out earlier.

CLAIRE	Maybe we can make a trade. I saw you checking this out before.

ANDY	I mean, no offense. I thank you, but I just-- I will never wear that.

MARK	I'll take it.

CLAIRE	Yeah? Hey, Mark, you see that lighthouse over there? You know your grandfather built that too, right? You should go check it out.

ANDY	Yeah, Mark, you should go check it out.

MARK	No way! I've only had one s'more. Ugh, fine.

ANDY	Have fun. So you and, uh, Ryan, are you guys...

CLAIRE	Forget Ryan. I don't like you like him. I like you like you.

MARK	Yes! Andy! You won't believe it! I... Wait, were you two—

ANDY	Nothing. We're nothing.

MARK	You were! You were sitting in a tree!

ANDY	What did you figure out, Mark? Better be good.

MARK	The answer to the clue. It's been here the whole time. Right in front of us.

ANDY	Okay, so what is a Polaris?

MARK	Polaris, the brightest star in the night sky, the North Star.

ANDY	On the north tip of the island. Dude, this is the first time I'm actually stoked that you're a Boy Scout.

CLAIRE	Let me get this straight. You think your grandfather's lost fortune is in a lighthouse?

ANDY	There's only one way to find out.

CLAIRE	Andy, come on! I wanna go.

MARK	Hey, Andy, there's something else down here.

CLAIRE	What is this place?

MARK	This must be the map room.

ANDY	Come on, Grandpa, where is it?

CLAIRE	Isn't X supposed to mark the spot?

ANDY	No. But XII does. Here, shine a light. Polaris at midnight. "Exceptional work, my sons. Rest not. You now hold every clue." What?

MARK	Great. Grandpa was crazy.

ANDY	If only we had the other pocket watch. Dude! You little ninja.

MARK	Guys, look! Check this out!

ANDY, MARK, CLAIRE	"Use birthday decoder."

ANDY	The World War II decoder at your house. We have to get it.

CLAIRE	No, no, my dad would kill you if he caught you even breathing on it.

MARK	Plus, it's really far. Uncle Trent locked our bikes, remember?

RIDGEWICK	Got enough cash for all your little minions running around here. You think we're stupid?

BROMAN	Look, you're not the only ones with your ass in a sling. I have developers flying in from China in 72 hours. If I can't deliver on my share, I'm out of a deal. Out. Do you understand what that means, hmm?

FLEMUS	You're trying to squeeze a few more nickels for yourself.

CLAIRE	Stay here. I'll get the key.

ANDY	No, no, no, wait till they leave.

CLAIRE	Trust me. Don't worry. Hi, Daddy. Everything all right?

BROMAN	Yes. Just doing business, sweetheart. Do you need me for something?

CLAIRE	I'm just gonna get the cards, play some solitaire and then go to bed.

BROMAN	All right, look, I'm asking you to wait a little while longer, all right? We're getting close.

CLAIRE	Night, Daddy.

BROMAN	Good night, sweetheart.

CLAIRE	I'll be there in a minute. Just go.

ANDY	No, no, we'll wait for you.

BROMAN	We'll all be winners.

ANDY	Here, here. Mark, read me that message quick.

MARK	Okay. "N-D-D-F-space-I."

BROMAN	Look, as I've already told you, there's a fortune to be made with this island, and it starts with finding out where the old man has buried his money. It's my buy-in. Without it, I have to stand on the sidelines and watch, so I suggest you get back out there and find it.

MARK	"C-O-B-E-B." Someone's coming.

ANDY	Uh, go, go, go, go, go!

MARK	Dude, come on! Don't! What are you doing?

CLAIRE	Dad. What are you doing? You took my key, didn't you? They're here, aren't they? Oh, my God.

BROMAN	Claire!

ANDY	Come on. Pass me the flashlight. Hey, this must be Grandpa's secret passageway.

MARK	I hope we don't find any dead things back here. Hey, what's that?

ANDY	Whoa.

MARK	You think we're supposed to take it?

ANDY	I guess. Let's go. Hey, this way. Ohh!

CLAIRE	My dad's on to you. You guys need to get out of here now.

ANDY	Okay, come on. Okay, let's take a look at that message.

ANDY, MARK	"One final step to discover real treasure that will never run dry. Be warned. What lies beneath is the root of all evil. Look under the West Forest roses."

ANDY	Mark, we can't just wander into that forest again. It's time to gear up, okay? Walkie-talkies.

MARK	Check.

ANDY	Lantern?

MARK	Check.

BROMAN	I'm asking you to wait a little while longer. Once this deal goes through, we'll all be rich.

RIDGEWICK	Enough talk. Open the safe.

BROMAN	Don't be foolhardy, Ridgewick.

RIDGEWICK	You know I know how to use this. Years of practice out in that forest, killing for you. Open it!

BROMAN	All right, all right. You want your money? Here it is. Don't ever threaten me again. Get him out of here. He's bleeding on my rug.

ANDY	Go get the stuff. Go, go, go. Um, I'm sorry I borrowed your truck, but it's back, so... I mean, you can hate me all you want.

TRENT	I don't hate you, kid. You're just like me. Wanna know why your dad doesn't talk to me? This is way before I had lost the house. When I was about your age, I stole a bunch of money from my dad, and I went to see the world. I wanted to have some fun. Prodigal son, the romanticism, that BS. The truth was, I was... selfish, stupid. Then one night I called home, and, uh, he said Dad's gone. Then when I got here, things, uh... were never the same.

ANDY	Well, I'm sure you did what you could.

TRENT	No. No, I did not. Because my brother needed me, and I wasn't there. I was searching for all the wrong things. When you do that, when your questions are all wrong, you're just gonna miss what it's all about.

ANDY	What's it all about?

TRENT	The treasure that never runs dry. I had my shot, and I blew it. Don't.

ANDY	"Backstroke Champion, Trent Walton". "Dear Andy, I'm sorry I can't be the father you deserve." "You never should have come. Forget about me." "Dear Andy, if only I could find the words, or find the strength to reach out to you, but I keep telling myself that we will meet again someday. Love Always, Dad." What is this?

TRENT	Andy, open up,

MARK	Andy, let me in!

TRENT	Open up! Hey!

MARK	Andy! Andy, don't leave me! Andy, take me with you! Andy!

TRENT	Jim, you need to get out here. Andy's gone.

ANDY	West Forest compass roses. Two keys. Yeah. No, no, no, no! No! No! No! Hey! Hey! Hey! Anybody! Mark? Mark, do you read me? Come in. Mark, it's Andy. Are you there? Does anybody read me? Can anybody read me? Help!

CLAIRE	Trent! Trent.

TRENT	Claire, what are you doing?

JIM	Four days and you lost 'em already, on an island? How'd you manage that, Trent, hmm? Trent, you wanna explain to me how this happens? He's a 17-year-old kid. You had one thing to do, look after him.

TRENT	Hey, spare me the parenting advice.

JIM	Parent? No, no, you lost the right to use that word when you dropped him on my lap 15 years ago.

TRENT	No, no.

JIM	I was his father, not you! I picked up the pieces. I was there!

TRENT	Pour it on, pour it on, pour it on.

JIM	You feel sorry for yourself now? Why don't you grow up? You had the chance. You didn't want to do that.

TRENT	You brought him here! You brought him here, not me! He was not supposed to know about me.

SALLY	Enough!

TRENT	None!

SALLY	Enough! Trent, you know the island. Where could he have gone?

CLAIRE	I know. They're not just watches. They're riddles. Your father left you both a message.

JIM	I never knew there were two.

CLAIRE	The answers lead to your father's fortune. That's where they went.

JIM	What do you mean, that's where they went?

TRENT	Claire. Where are they?

CLAIRE	They went to the West Forest.

TRENT	He took my truck. We'll need to get there by boat.

ANDY	If anybody's listening... this is Andrew Walton, son of Trent Walton, brother to no one. And now I'm here... underground where nobody can find me. I made it all this way... for a dead end. A dead end.

MARK	Andy, come in. What's your 10-9?

ANDY	Mark? Mark, is that you? Mark! Mark! That's you!

MARK	Andy, where the heck are you?

ANDY	I'm underneath you. I'm underneath you. Do you see the remote that we stole from Broman's? Do you see it?

MARK	The black flashy thing?

ANDY	Yes! Yes! Okay, push the button. Mark! Mark?

MARK	Andy!

ANDY	Mark! You came for me.

MARK	Why did you leave without me?

ANDY	I found out why I've never heard of Uncle Trent.

MARK	I saw the bottles. Hey, hey. So what? No matter what Trent wrote, we'll always be brothers. Now come on, brother, let's see what's down there.

ANDY	No. Mark, Mark, it's a dead end. Mark! You know my favorite time I remember being your brother? The time we went on this crazy treasure hunt that led us to a cave holding millions. Till we got stuck 'cause we were missing a key.

MARK	Well, that's not how I remember it.

ANDY	Well, only one way to find out. Okay, ready? Three, two, one.

MARK	Whoa.

ANDY	Organ pipes? It's just for spooks.

MARK	But why?

ANDY	That's why. It's a mine, Mark. It's a gold mine. That is what he meant when he said, "a treasure that would never run dry."

MARK	Look! There's a way out! If the fall didn't kill you...

ANDY	Those currents would certainly do the rest. Come on.

MARK	Whoa. This is a nice one.

ANDY	"Broman." "Broman." Broman. He found out there was gold on this island. "Trent and Jim." "Boys, if you're reading this, you're together again, and you've discovered the real treasure that will never run dry: love. Take care of each other. Dad. P.S. You're rich."

BROMAN	Nice job, boys, but I believe your work here is done. Step aside. You have to appreciate the irony. Richard Walton's grandsons lead me to the treasure I could never find, and now I'm going to use it to sweep his family aside for good.

ANDY	What is your deal? What is your vendetta against my family?

BROMAN	Your grandfather cheated me. I processed all of his gold and never once did he cut me into the deal. I made him rich, and he gave me nothing.

ANDY	He didn't just disappear, did he? You certified all the gold that he brought in, so you followed him out one night, probably foggy, nobody around, and you made sure that nobody ever found his body.

BROMAN	Well, that's an outrageous accusation and one that will never hold up in court. What have you done? "Riches you may possess, but only the hand of a Walton shall grant release." What does that mean? What does it mean? Tell me! What's this, hmm? Is this the key getting us out of here?

ANDY	You know what the funny thing is? Only one of us knows how to use that thing. The other doesn't have a clue.

BROMAN	Enough. I'm not asking you to open it. I'm telling you.

ANDY	No, Broman. I'm telling you. You have screwed over my family for three generations. Now your run ends here. It ends with us.

BROMAN	That's very brave, taking a stand. Unfortunately, that's not how you negotiate. This is how you negotiate.

ANDY	You can't shoot me.

BROMAN	Oh?

ANDY	You need the hand of a Walton.

BROMAN	True. But I only need one.

ANDY	Mark! You picked wrong.

BROMAN	Oh, God!

JIM	Trent, there's something in the water! There! There! You see it? Something there?

MARK	Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy, help!

JIM	There!

MARK	Help me! Help!

JIM	You gotta slow down!

MARK	Help me! He went down! He went under!

TRENT	Take the wheel. Take the wheel! We're not gonna be able to swim to the surface, so you're gonna have to pull us up.

ANDY	Come on, come on! Come on! Come on! Wake up! Wake up! Come on! Come on! Come on! Who do you think you are, my father? Come on, wake up!

TRENT	I was searching for all the wrong things. When you do that, you're just gonna miss what it's all about. I had my shot, and I blew it. I wish I was better with words. I was just so messed up when your mom got sick. I was lost. Just, uh... And then Jim and Sally stepped in, thankfully. I figured you were better off if I was dead. And I was. And then you came.

ANDY	I guess I don't understand. Um, why go through the trouble of writing all those letters and never send 'em?

TRENT	I guess I thought that if I wrote 'em and sent 'em out, somehow you'd feel me. The idea of it anyway.

ANDY	I'm not an idea. I'm right here. So if you wanna love me, then love me.

TRENT	Okay.

ANDY	That day it was finally clear to me, that my grandfather had put together the final treasure hunt..., just to bring his sons back together again, to see the Waltons side by side, sharing the treasure that never runs dry.
