Surprise!@9@8@8@8@8
Oh my God, you're huge.@23@22@21@18@17
No traffic.@11@10@10@9@9
And I crushed the final.@24@23@23@19@19
@0@0@0@0@0
No such luck.@13@12@12@10@10
My mom was the math genius.@27@26@26@21@21
Look at you.@12@11@11@9@9
Wow. Bag packed.@16@14@14@12@12
House looks great.@18@17@17@15@15
You've been busy.@17@16@15@14@13
Where is Miranda?@17@16@16@14@14
Yes.@4@3@3@3@3
Thank you, thank you.@21@20@20@17@17
You sure you're okay?@21@20@19@17@16
Seriously, I am here to help.@29@28@28@23@23
Mm. Yum.@8@6@6@5@5
True.@5@4@4@4@4
That's definitely in the genes.@31@30@29@26@25
He has that because of you.@27@26@26@21@21
Really? You think he's funny?@29@27@26@23@22
No wonder he loves you.@23@22@22@18@18
Whatever you say.@17@16@16@14@14
Oh. I got this for Anthony. Isn't he cute?@42@39@38@31@30
And I got this@14@14@14@11@11
from my friend who's a psych major.@35@34@33@28@27
I think it might help. Dad said Miranda's@41@40@39@33@32
still not doing well.@21@20@20@17@17
Good.@5@4@4@4@4
They should be home soon, right?@32@31@31@26@26
Oh.@3@2@2@2@2
What is it? What's wrong?@25@23@22@19@18
No.@3@2@2@2@2
I'll go.@8@7@6@6@5
Yes, it makes the most sense.@29@28@28@23@23
You should stay here and wait for Miranda to come home.@55@54@54@44@44
I'll follow you.@16@15@14@13@12
I will.@7@6@6@5@5
We'll find her.@15@14@13@12@11
I haven't seen him in months.@29@28@27@23@22
I've been away at school.@25@24@23@20@19
He was so happy with Jenny and the baby.@40@39@39@31@31
Still no word on Miranda?@25@24@24@20@20
Morning?@8@7@7@7@7
That's too late.@16@15@14@13@12
I have to do something. I can't just sit here.@46@44@43@35@34
I can get volunteers through social media.@42@41@41@35@35
Wait, what?@11@10@10@9@9
Where's the sheriff? Why isn't he here?@39@37@35@31@29
Who's in charge?@16@15@14@13@12
But you're not.@15@14@13@12@11
My dad is dead, and my sister is missing.@41@40@40@32@32
What are you doing about it?@28@27@27@22@22
No, you don't.@14@13@12@11@10
Jesus.@6@5@5@5@5
You called the others, right?@29@28@28@24@24
I know, but I just can't sit here anymore@41@41@40@33@32
doing nothing.@14@13@13@12@12
The deputies aren't telling me anything@39@39@38@34@33
and I don't even think they know what they're doing.@52@51@49@42@40
I know it's dangerous, you don't have to do it.@47@46@44@37@35
Okay. Thank you.@16@14@14@12@12
I'll see you in an hour at the rest stop.@41@40@39@31@30
And keep it quiet.@18@17@17@14@14
Watch your step.@16@15@15@13@13
Can we hurry up, please?@24@23@23@19@19
 Yeah, I do. He's old.@21@19@18@15@14
We should branch out.@21@20@20@17@17
Guys! Come here.@16@14@14@12@12
That's Miranda's.@17@16@14@15@13
Positive.@9@8@8@8@8
Does that mean you found her?@29@28@28@23@23
Is there something we can do?@29@28@28@23@23
Can we go with you@18@18@18@14@14
and organize the volunteer search party there?@46@45@45@39@39
Please?@7@6@6@6@6
Understood.@11@10@10@10@10
We wanna help look for Miranda.@31@30@30@25@25
Miranda!@8@7@7@7@7
Thank God. Thank God.@21@19@19@16@16
Oh my God.@10@9@9@7@7
I can't get through. It keeps going straight to voicemail.@58@56@55@47@46
Hello?@6@5@5@5@5
I'll make you a sandwich.@25@24@23@20@19
Oh, my God.@11@10@10@8@8
Let's go.@9@8@7@7@6
The bag. The bag.@17@15@15@12@12
Breathe, Mom. Breathe.@22@20@20@18@18
Oh, my girls.@13@12@12@10@10
He's coming.@12@11@10@10@9
Yeah, we have to go.@20@19@19@15@15
