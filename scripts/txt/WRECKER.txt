EMILY	I was visiting my sister in Sacramento for a few days, what else?

LESLIE	Did you get that? 

LESLIE	I know, I cannot believe she's actually going through with this either, it’s like we have the old Emily back.

LESLIE	Uhh we’ve got like two bags of weed, some tequila, some rum, some gin, and two cases of beer.

LESLIE	Who cares? Pay-back's a bitch.

EMILY	We’re still alive okay?

EMILY	We’re still alive.

WAITRESS	I walk like that after a night of heavy pounding. 

EMILY	Yeah we’re just in a little discomfort, that’s all. 

EMILY	Nothing a few pain killers can’t cure.

WAITRESS	Oh I know all about discomfort sweetie. You try working this joint with these god awful corns I got growing on my toes.

WAITRESS	Take your order?

LESLIE	Please bring two coffees.

WAITRESS	Two it is I will come back for your orders, and a fork you can eat with.

EMILY	Thank you

EMILY	He’s back.

LESLIE	What??

EMILY	No, no don’t… I just said he’s back. His trucks parked out there in the lot.

LESLIE	But he fucking left. We saw him - we saw him leave. Why would he come back for us? What does he want from us?

EMILY	I’ve got no idea just - just be quiet while I try and figure out who it is.

LESLIE	OK I’m not sure but there are two possibilities.

EMILY	There’s two possibilities!? Fuck we shouldn’t even be hear I want to get back on the road.

WAITRESS	Save it sweetie, ain’t no reception ‘round here.

LESLIE	Yeah I know that. Do you have a house phone maybe that we could use?

WAITRESS	Well you could but it ain't workin'.

LESLIE	Of course it’s not working ‘cause nothing works in this shit hole

WAITRESS	Excuse me?

LESLIE	Can I get the soup? That cup or bowl?

WAITRESS	Neither. Sold out.

EMILY	You know what we will just have two cheeseburgers. How does that sound Leslie?

WAITRESS	Two cheeseburgers. Anything else?

EMILY	No. That'll be all, thank you.

WAITRESS	Oh, by the way, just a little further on up the road, there's a rest stop, by the summit. You might get some reception there. 

EMILY	We’ll try there, thank you.

EMILY	You need to tone it down a notch.

EMILY	Look it’s almost noon. 

EMILY	This is probably the only diner around for miles. 

EMILY	Probably comes here all the time to eat. Maybe he was just going too fast down the hill - he had to slow down and turn around and… that’s all?

EMILY	That’s all.

LESLIE	I think we should leave.

LESLIE	That way if he follows us we know his true intentions

EMILY	And then what? We’re right back to where we started.

EMILY	Look it’s fine the mustang its powerful enough, no problems there but there is no way I’m going to continue driving the speeds we’re going. It’s way to fuckin dangerous.

LESLIE	Okay, we talk to him then.

EMILY	To who Leslie which one?

EMILY	Look let’s just sit here, be patient. We’ll figure it out soon enough.

EMILY	Thanks.

EMILY	Oh my god he’s leaving, he’s leaving.
