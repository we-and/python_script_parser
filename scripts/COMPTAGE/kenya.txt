LAUREN	We did those. Boring. We wanted an adventure. 

JACK	We? 

LAUREN	Me. The kids. You. It's good all around. 

JACK	Yeah. It'll be fun. I just don't like the fact that this family's become a democracy all of a sudden. 

LAUREN	It was a velvet coup, honey. 

JACK	Hah. 

LAUREN	You never noticed. 

LAUREN	Whoa, heaven, Jack. I've landed in heaven. Thank you.

STAFF MEMBER 2	Bye-bye.

NOAH	How can they not have

NOAH	a paved road from the airport? 

JACK	It's a developing nation. I guess they don't have

JACK	the money for that kind of thing. 

JACK	Oh, my gosh. Look, look, look, look. 

LAUREN	Wow. Wow. Wow. Look at that.

ZOE	Oh, my gosh. 

LAUREN	Aw. 

ZOE	Oh, my God. They're real.

LAUREN	Jack. (chuckles)

BILLY	Ooh. 

ZOE	Ugh. Oh my God, wait.

ZOE	Are we all sharing?

ZOE	I thought we get our own rooms. 

NOAH	You think I'm happy about it? 

BILLY	This is not cool. 

ZOE	Fucking Jack. He doesn't even get us our own rooms. 

NOAH	Stop calling him Jack. Why don't you call him Dad anymore? It's weird.

NOAH	Well, you guys can fight over the car. 

ZOE	No, no, no.

NOAH	I'm not sleeping over there.

LAUREN	When I was a little girl, I had this book about Africa, and this mountain was on the cover of it. And I used to stare at it for hours just wishing I was there. And now I'm finally here. I just can't believe it.

JACK	(breathes deeply) Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I've been…

LAUREN	An asshole?

JACK	I was gonna say distant. But asshole works, yeah. 

LAUREN	Sorry, Jack. I know  I can tell you've got a lot on your mind.

LAUREN	You know, you could share.

JACK	I just want the last family vacation before Zoe goes off to college to be special. 

LAUREN	If she goes off to college. You heard her, Jack. 

JACK	She's gonna go to college. Who drops out of MIT to work in a vegan coffee shop, for crying out loud? Is she gonna throw her life away? 

LAUREN	Well, I spent seven years in medical school and haven't worked in 15. She wants to find herself. 

JACK	She can find herself after college. You know, you know what it is?

JACK	It's that boyfriend of hers.

JACK	That's who's doing this.

JACK	I mean, why is he even here, huh? 

LAUREN	(scoffs) You want Zoe, you get Billy.

LAUREN	That's young love.

JACK	Yeah, he's not that young. 

LAUREN	Same age difference as we were.

JACK	Yeah. But you didn't make me cut all my hair off.

JACK	Quit college.

LAUREN	You never had long hair.

LAUREN	Look, he's a nice kid. He really likes Zoe. I like him.

JACK	Yeah.

JACK	You don't have to pay for him. 

LAUREN	Gosh, can you just relax, Jack? Relax. 

JACK	(sighing deep) 

JACK	Shoot.

JACK	I stink. I'm gonna have a shower.

BILLY	Lots of frogs. 

NOAH	Oh, remember that little frog I had? Ice Cream? 

ZOE	Oh, yeah. Whatever happened to him? 

NOAH	I put him in my pocket and he died.

ZOE	Jesus, Noah. 

NOAH	I didn't mean to.

BILLY	Oh, little guy.

BILLY	I found you.

ZOE	Oh, my God. Oh… 

BILLY	Do you know what this is? 

NOAH	Grass? 

BILLY	No, my friend. Not grass.

BILLY	This… is salvia.

ZOE	Salvia.

BILLY	Also known as Lady Sally. Used by many for its analgesic and antispasmodic properties. But most importantly, it gets you high as fuck. 

NOAH	I'm sure it's just a shrub.

BILLY	Guess we'll find out in, what?

BILLY	Twenty minutes? 

NOAH	Zo! 


ZOE	What? 

NOAH	We're like a 100 miles from a hospital.

ZOE	Oh, my God. You sound like Jack. Ugh. 

NOAH	You know, that actually makes him really upset when you call him that.

ZOE	He can take it. It's fine.

BILLY	Come on, Zoe. 

NOAH	I'm actually going to do a workout with Dad before dinner, doing like an African circuit thing… 

ZOE AND BILLY	(laughing) 

NOAH	Okay.

LAUREN	You've been fired? 

JACK	You looked… you looked at my phone? That's an invasion of my  

LAUREN	Don't you dare, Jack. 

JACK	Give me my phone. Give me my phone. Give me my  

LAUREN	What happened? 

JACK	Nothing. I wasn't fired. It was… it's administrative leave  It is nothing. 

LAUREN	Jack! Stop it! 

JACK	Nothing happened. Okay? 

LAUREN	What happened? 

JACK	Nothing. I just  there was a small problem with the Dakota pipeline and it… it's standard protocol to put the project manager on administrative leave while they clean it up.

LAUREN	Clean it up? What? Was there a spill?

JACK	A little bit. It was handled. I mean, maybe a little late. 

LAUREN	Ho  how bad was it? Why didn't you tell me? 

JACK	I did I didn't tell you because I wanted you to enjoy this vacation, okay? God knows it costs enough. 

LAUREN	Wait… do we have to worry about money now? I 

JACK	Things could get a little tight and we might need to tighten our belts a little after this. Yeah.

LAUREN	Are you going to be fired? 

JACK	No, I'm not going to be fired. Okay? No, it's not like that. I…

JACK	I don't think so. I'll go back as soon as they sort it out. Can I please have my phone?

ZOE	(chuckling)

NOAH	(sighing)

NOAH	Fine?

JACK	He's not distracting you, is he?

NOAH	No, he's not distracting me. 

JACK	All right. It's just, you know, it's… something that your coach said. 

NOAH	What? 

JACK	He was just checking if you were okay. I mean, what with all the doctor's appointments that you've been going to over the last few weeks. The ones that conveniently fall between the hours
JACK	of 6 and 8 p.m., right in the middle of practice. I mean, from where I'm standing, this thing is distracting you. 

NOAH	No. Sam is not a thing. 

JACK	You know what I'm saying.

NOAH	Yes, I do know what you're saying.

NOAH	You wish that Sam was my girlfriend.

NOAH	But he's not. He's my boy 

JACK	That's not

BILLY	Well, they're scavengers, bro. Nature's trash cans, right? 

LUCAS	That's true, Billy.

LUCAS	But when alone is just harmless. But if they're in a group, they're very dangerous. They can even kill a lion.

LAUREN	Okay. 

LUCAS	If found alone, this can do the magic.

LUCAS	It's all you need, really.

LUCAS	That's okay. Just go back to having fun.

ZOE	Oh, wow. Such a good driver. 

BILLY	Way to go, Noah. 

ZOE	Such a good driver.

ZOE	(laughs) 

BILLY	(whooping) 

LAUREN	Yeah, there we go.

BILLY	(whooping)

BILLY	Now we're gonna see some wildlife. 

NOAH	We don't want any more zebra. Okay? 

ZOE	Yeah.

LAUREN	Are we bored with zebra? Gosh, I can't believe

LAUREN	Yeah. Whoever thought we'd be bored by a zebra. 

JACK	Bored by zebras. Bored by zebras, that's right. 

LAUREN	Bored by zebras. Right? 

JACK	That is amazing. Billy, Zoe, not again. 

LAUREN AND NOAH	Oh, my!

ZOE	What the fuck, Noah!

LAUREN	Oh my… gosh.

LAUREN	My gosh! Oh, my…

ZOE	Oh, wow. 

JACK	Got you a rhino, baby. 

LAUREN	Oh, yes, you did, baby. This is incredible.

LAUREN	Wow. It's gorgeous. 

JACK	Wow! 

LAUREN	Hey guys, can we get a little closer? Just a little bit. 

NOAH	Can I? 

LAUREN	Please. 

JACK	Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Just put some nice

LAUREN	Oh, wow. This is unbelievable. Just a little, ah! Giant animal with a spike on its face.

BILLY	What could possibly go wrong? 

NOAH	Mom, are you getting the picture?

LAUREN	I mean, never in my wildest dreams. Are you seeing (gasps)

LAUREN	Oh, wow.

LAUREN	Oh, wow.

LAUREN	Zoe, look at this. Is this

LAUREN	is that a baby? Look, is that a baby? 

ZOE	Oh, my God. That is so cute.

LAUREN	Hi! Look at the baby. 

BILLY	Wait, we shouldn't be getting

BILLY	between them. Right? 

JACK	Yeah, I can't believe

JACK	I'm saying this, but I agree with you, Billy. Back, back it up just a bit. 

NOAH	Wait, I'm not

NOAH	Wait, I'm not good at reversing. 

JACK	Lauren, Lauren. Would you get down, honey?

NOAH	Is that in reverse? 

JACK	That's in reverse. There you go. There you go.

ZOE	Oh, my God. Noah, back it up.

ZOE	Noah, back it up!

JACK	It's okay. 

NOAH	I'm sorry. Sorry, okay?

ZOE	Oh, my gosh. Stop it. Noah!

NOAH	I'm not good at reversing, I'm sorry. 

JACK	Slowly. There you go. 

LAUREN	Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

NOAH	Oh, my God! Dad. 

JACK	No, you're okay. 

AL	(screaming) (tires screech) 

ALL	(screaming)

LAUREN	Drive! Jack, drive.

JACK	Oh, oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. It's okay. It's okay.

JACK	She's done. She's done. She's not done. She's not done.

LAUREN	Jack! 

BILLY	She gone?

JACK	Shh… shh…

LAUREN	Everybody okay? Noah. Zoe.

ZOE	Oh, fuck! 

NOAH	She's gone.

NOAH	She's gone. She's gone. She's gone.

NOAH	Are you okay?

NOAH	She's gone. She's gone. She's gone.

LAUREN	She's gone, Jack. 

JACK	(groaning)

LAUREN	You got you got tagged. 

JACK	(grunting) Did it hit the femoral?

LAUREN	Ah, no. It did not hit the femoral. If it did, you'd be dead by now. But you know what? You're bleeding badly.

JACK	That's okay. Is everyone okay? 

LAUREN	I'll be right there, Zoe. You hang in there.

BILLY	Okay, okay. 

NOAH	Zoe? 

BILLY	(grunting)

ZOE	Yeah, yeah. Just stop touching it. 

JACK	Honey, are you okay, baby?

JACK	(grunting) 

LAUREN	Okay. Put all your weight on that.

JACK	Okay. That's great. 

LAUREN	All right. Okay.

ZOE	My head 

NOAH	Are you okay?

JACK	Noah? Are you okay, buddy? 

LAUREN	There's so much blood.


NOAH	I'm all right, Dad. 

LAUREN	So much blood. 

JACK	I think I think it's bad. 

ZOE	Mom… Mom… (crying)

NOAH	Mom, what's happening? 

LAUREN	Are you all right, Noah?

LAUREN	Are you okay? Okay. All right. Okay, Zoe, here I come. 

ZOE	Mom, it's broken. 

LAUREN	It might not be broken. 

ZOE	It is broken. I know it's broken. 

LAUREN	Let me see. Let me see.

NOAH	Dad, what happened? 

ZOE	fucking thing off me! 

LAUREN	Okay. All right. 

ZOE	Is it broken?

LAUREN	Remember what happened when you fell off your bike? 

ZOE	Yeah. I remember how much it hurt.

LAUREN	Okay, I remember how brave you were. 

ZOE	No. I wasn't brave.

ZOE	I'm not, Mom. What! Billy 

LAUREN	Brace it from behind. There we go.

LAUREN	(grunting) 

ZOE	Oh, fuck!

ZOE	(cries)

JACK	(grunting) 

LAUREN	I'm fine. I'm fine. Jack? 

JACK	Ah, yeah, yeah. 

LAUREN	Okay. 

JACK	Thank you. Okay. 

LAUREN	Baby, I would have done the same.

JACK	That's okay. It's okay. You guys all right? 

LAUREN	Are you okay, Zoe?

NOAH	If I would've if I would've just backed up… faster. 

ZOE	Been able to drive faster? 

JACK	It's done now. It's done, all right? 

LAUREN	Zoe, lay off. 

BILLY	Ah, jeez. 

JACK	Well, let's, uh, let's see if we can right this thing. See if it still drives.

ZOE	What? How are we gonna do that? 

LAUREN	Yeah. How are we gonna do that, Jack? 

JACK	We're gonna act like a family. All right. We're gonna work together. 

BILLY	(sighs) Yeah, we got to try, man. 

JACK	Right. All right, let's get some legs and arms on each corner. 

NOAH	Dad, this thing's not gonna move. 

BILLY	(indistinct). On three, right? 

JACK	Yep. 

ALL	One, two, three. 

JACK	(grunting) 

LAUREN	Well, we tried. 

NOAH	Let me just get my phone. Where's my phone? We can call for help. 

JACK	Come on. 

NOAH	Ah! I don't have any signal. 

LAUREN	Hey, guys, stay close. Don't go too far, okay? Noah? 

ZOE	Yeah. I don't (indistinct). 

LAUREN	Well, I mean, let's stay close to each other and the van. 

NOAH	Does anybody have a signal? 

BILLY	Here you go, Mr. H. 

JACK	(sighing) Thanks, Billy. It's gonna cost a fortune. 

LAUREN	The important thing is everybody's alive, okay? Insurance will cover it.

LAUREN	Te tell me you got insurance. You got insurance? 

JACK	I got insurance. Yeah. 

LAUREN	Great. 

JACK	Fully comp was expensive.

LAUREN	What what… what are we gonna do? We've got no car, no signal.

LAUREN	What are we gonna do? 

JACK	I… don't know. Do you?

LAUREN	No. No. I don't.

JACK	Then how about… how about a little equality?

JACK	Because I'm no more equipped to deal with any of this than any of you.

JACK	Besides, someone will find us. Someone will realize that we haven't checked back into the lodge. 

ZOE	No, they won't.

ZOE	You drove through the gate without registering. Do you remember?

ZOE	No one knows that we're here. 

NOAH	Okay, so we go back out onto one of the main roads and get some help.

NOAH	I mean, there were cars that were passing by. 

LAUREN	We can't go walking through the bush. That's crazy. 

ZOE	Aren't you supposed to wait

ZOE	by where the accident happened? 

BILLY	That's right.

ZOE	That's what they teach you. Wait, and then someone comes. 

BILLY	On a closed back road?

NOAH	Yeah, exactly. How is anyone gonna find us here?

BILLY	We start a fire. 

ZOE	That's a good idea.

NOAH	Billy, can you start a fire? 

BILLY	I saw it on TV.

BILLY	Naked and Afraid. You know, they do it all the time. Rub sticks together. 

ZOE	Yeah, you can start a fire. Just take the battery wires from the sparkplug and make a short circuit.

ZOE	Total fuck. 

NOAH	How are you gonna do that?

ZOE	Yeah, I know, the current hasn't stopped because the terminal's fucked. 

JACK	You know, that's not as dumb as it sounds, sweetheart.

ZOE	Oh, I'm sorry. Did it sound dumb? 

LAUREN	(puking)

JACK	Geez, babe.

ZOE	Oh, my God, Mom? 

JACK	Honey?

BILLY	You all right? 

LAUREN	I'm fine. I'm just a little… a little anxious. Ah.

BILLY	You're shaking, Mrs. H. Are you cold? 

ZOE	She's not cold. It's 500 fucking degrees. 

JACK	Are you cold? 

LAUREN	No, I, uh… could someone get my insulin?

JACK	Okay.

ZOE	Noah. 

JACK	It's in her bag, Noah. 

NOAH	Okay. 

JACK	(indistinct).

NOAH	Where is it? 

JACK	(grunting) It's in her little bag. Her little purse that she wore. That's it. That's it, bud.

JACK	It's a black… it's a black purse. 

LAUREN	I'm fine.

JACK	There you go, bud. There you go. There you go. You're kidding me.

LAUREN	No. I'll be fine. My glucose levels are high so I'll feel a little rough, but I'll be… maybe a little water. Thanks, Billy.

BILLY	No water. 

LAUREN	What? 

JACK	We brought water. 

BILLY	The glass bottles broke. 

JACK	Oh, my gosh.

NOAH	Oh, that's that's great. Save the planet.

ZOE	Shut up. 

BILLY	Come on, dude. 

LAUREN	Guys, please stop. Not now. 

JACK	Okay. Okay.

LAUREN	We've got some time. About a half a day. 

BILLY	Are you all right? 

ZOE	(crying) Diabetic ketoacidosis. 

BILLY	What does that mean?

ZOE	It means in about eight hours, she's gonna be in a coma.

ZOE	And then… 

BILLY	(whispers) Oh, gez.

JACK	Hey, hey, there's something over there. 

BILLY	What did the guy at the lodge say?

BILLY	One is not a problem, right? 

JACK	Right. Right.

BILLY	Okay. I got this. 

ZOE	Billy. (whispering) Billy.

LAUREN	Don't. 

BILLY	Go on. Go on.

BILLY	Hey, fuck right off, you mangy half dog. 

BILLY	(laughs)

BILLY	I didn't think that would actually work. You gotta get primal! 

JACK	Guys, guys, guys.

NOAH	Billy. 

JACK	Hey, Billy.

ZOE	Oh, shit. Billy. 

JACK	Get in the van. Get in the van.

BILLY	Oh, shit. 

JACK	Get in the van. Get in.

JACK	Get in the van. Guys, get in the van. Come here. Get in. Come on. Get in. 

LAUREN	Billy, get in.

NOAH	What are we gonna do? 

LAUREN	Just keep still and be quiet. 

ZOE	Billy.

JACK	(groans) (panting)

JACK	I think they're gone. We're gonna be okay.

JACK	(sighs) Hey. Are you okay? 

LAUREN	Yeah. It's just hot.

NOAH	Dad.

NOAH	Does the AC work? 

JACK	Well…

JACK	Nope. No, it still doesn't work. 

LAUREN	It's still not working.

JACK	Still not working. 

ZOE	Mom, you got to get in the shade. 

BILLY	Oh, wait. We can make a sunshade

BILLY	out of this blanket. Give me a hand, Noah.

JACK	Take it through here and trap it in that window.

ZOE	What are you doing, Mom? 

LAUREN	I'm making you a sling. We need to keep your arm still.

LAUREN	Billy, can you please wrap it up in this?

ZOE	You guys know we can't stay here, though, right? Like the hyenas are gonna come back.

JACK	I think we should wait. I mean, you said so yourself.

ZOE	Yeah, but that was BH. 

BILLY	Before hyena.

JACK	Someone will come after us. 

NOAH	Is there any water left in those bottles? Is there any at all? 

JACK	There's tourists all over this place. 

LAUREN	This… This place is the size of

ZOE	Yeah. New York.

ZOE	We know, Mom.

JACK	Hey, we're gonna stay put.

JACK	That's my decision. That's final. Okay?

ZOE	Oh, you made that decision?

ZOE	So, we have no say in that?

JACK	That's right.

NOAH	(coughs) 

ZOE	(whispers) My God. You're such a dick.

LAUREN	Zoe, stop. 

JACK	What what did you say, young lady?

ZOE	That you're a dick.

LAUREN	Oh, Zoe. 

JACK	Oh.

JACK	Okay, well, well, uh, you're right. I am. So, let's see those, um, those festival tickets? Canceled. They're trash.

JACK	And your phone payment? That's gone. Uh, your allowance? See you later.

LAUREN	How is this helping?

JACK	It's not, but I'm a dick! Remember? That's how dicks act, right? 

ZOE	Mm-hm.

JACK	Yeah. Okay, well.

ZOE	Guess what? The joke's on you, Jack.

ZOE	I don't need festival tickets if we're all fucking dead.

LAUREN	Zoe! 

JACK	Don't call me Jack!

JACK	Goddammit, Zoe! 

NOAH	Be quiet. 

LAUREN	Zoe, nobody's dying. 

JACK	I'm your father.

ZOE	Technically, you're not.

JACK	Jesus, Zoe.

NOAH	Can you guys not argue right now? Can you just save it for later, please?

JACK	I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry, Zoe.

ZOE	Sorry, too. 

LAUREN	There's no signal.

JACK	Not here, but…

JACK	Maybe back there. There was higher ground back there. If there's a signal anywhere,

JACK	that's where it's gonna be.

LAUREN	What are you doing? 

JACK	I am gonna make a call. 

LAUREN	You can't go anywhere, Jack. 

JACK	You need your insulin.

LAUREN	My glucose levels are high.

LAUREN	That's it.

JACK	What about in an hour… or two, huh? 

ZOE	Jack, I don't think you can make it up that hill.

JACK	I'll crawl if I have to. 

LAUREN	Then I'll go with you. 

JACK	That's crazy. 

LAUREN	No crazier than you. 

NOAH	I'll go.

LAUREN	Noah… 

NOAH	I'll go. I'm-I'm faster than anyone else here.

BILLY	(scoffs) Rude. 

LAUREN	No. 

NOAH	Why? 

LAUREN	Because no.

NOAH	Why? You don't think I can make it? 

JACK	It's not that. It's just…

JACK	It's not safe. 

BILLY	I'll go with him. Keep your little superstar out of trouble.

BILLY	Two sets of eyes and all that. 

NOAH	That's fine with me.

ZOE	Wait, no. What if the hyenas come back?

BILLY	Then you just use your angry voice with them.

NOAH	Or just use your normal voice. Same thing.

ZOE	You're a brat.

JACK	You wanna take this in case your signal is different? 

LAUREN	Please. Please be safe.

BILLY	Thanks, Missus H.

JACK	Careful.

NOAH	Geez. 

NOAH	Oh, shit. 

NOAH	What the hell was that? 

BILLY	Are you scared? 

NOAH	Oh, hell yeah. But anything's better than staying in the van

NOAH	with everyone arguing.

NOAH	What are you doing? 

BILLY	Never trust trees, bud.

BILLY	They play tricks on you.

NOAH	You smoke too much weed.

BILLY	(scoffs) You don't smoke enough. It might help you chill. 

NOAH	Hell no, dude. They drug test at school.

BILLY	(grunts) Well, be a good way to get you off the team.

BILLY	I know you want to. 

NOAH	No, I don't. It'd crush Dad.

BILLY	You shouldn't be doing it just for him anyway. 

NOAH	Come out as gay and get kicked off the team?

NOAH	No, I think it's one or the other. 

BILLY	Yeah. Zoe said he was upset. 

NOAH	He's not upset. He's just… I don't know. He's confused. You know? I mean, he doesn't get it. 

BILLY	Who even gives a shit anyway.

NOAH	I don't know. He's thinks it's gonna ruin my career. I'm not gonna get a scholarship. Even if I do, I'll get crucified for being gay. 

BILLY	A little too keen on the wrong type of balls. 

NOAH	Jesus, Billy. 

BILLY	What? It it was funny.

BILLY	I can think of worse places to die.

NOAH	Hey, nobody's gonna die. Nobody's gonna die. Okay? 

BILLY	Well, actually, everyone is.

NOAH	Anyone ever told you you're kind of a dick? 

BILLY	(chuckles) Yeah, your sister may have mentioned it once or twice. And your dad. But he's a dick, too. So, we cancel each other out. 

NOAH	He's not a dick.

NOAH	He's not always a dick, okay? He's 

BILLY	Oh. Come on, dude.

BILLY	All white men in suits are fucking everything up for us. They're fucking this up for us, man.

BILLY	You down with that? 

NOAH	No, but I mean, it's not just him, right? I mean, we all do it.

NOAH	It's always someone else's responsibility.

NOAH	We we did a project about mining cobalt in the Congo for cell phone batteries. You know how much… violence there is? Corruption. Child labor. All for this.

NOAH	Oil is nothing, man. We're all greedy. No one really cares.

BILLY	Fuck, Noah. You're making it quite difficult for me to maintain my essentially positive attitude.

NOAH	Wait a minute.

NOAH	Dude. Do you see that?

NOAH	Do you see that? Right there?

NOAH	It could be like a, like a lodge or like a ranger station.

NOAH	Give me give me the binoculars.

BILLY	I thought you had them.

NOAH	How much of that grass you been eatin'?

BILLY	Not enough.

NOAH	I think we can make it.

NOAH	What do you think? 

BILLY	I don't know, man. That is a long 

BILLY	(screams and grunts)

NOAH	Oh, my God!

BILLY	(screams) Fuck off me. 

NOAH	Billy!

BILLY	Fuck off!

BILLY	Oh, my God. 

NOAH	Oh, my God. Oh, shit. 

BILLY	(screaming) Oh, my God. 

BILLY	(screaming) 

NOAH	(yells) Okay. 

NOAH	Billy? Billy? Oh, my God. 

NOAH	(yells) Billy?

NOAH	(panting) Shit.  (groans) Oh, man. 

NOAH	Turn around. Okay. Okay. Oh. Fuck shit. Okay. Oh, oh.

NOAH	Oh, yes. Okay. Yes, Billy. Yes. Okay.

LAUREN	(moaning) Hm-mm.

ZOE	Mom? 

LAUREN	Yeah. 

ZOE	How are you feeling? 

LAUREN	I'm fine.

LAUREN	Maybe just a little water?

ZOE	There is no water, Mom. Remember?

LAUREN	Yeah.

JACK	Geez.

ZOE	Did you guys get a signal? 

JACK	Noah. 

ZOE	Where's Billy?

NOAH	Something got him.

NOAH	Something got him. 

JACK	What?! 

ZOE	What?

NOAH	A big cat. It was a big fucking cat.

ZOE	Wait, wait. You just left him?

NOAH	I couldn't do anything. It just ripped his neck out.

NOAH	Just ripped it clean out.

ZOE	Oh, my God. 

LAUREN	Zoe. Zoe.

LAUREN	Jack, get Zoe. 

JACK	Yeah. I got her. I got her. Zoe! 

NOAH	(coughing)

LAUREN	Are you okay? 

JACK	Zoe, sweetheart. Zoe, wait. Damn it, Zoe.

JACK	It's not safe.

JACK	Dammit! Zoe!

JACK	(groans) Zoe. Zoe. Oh, God. Zoe, baby. 

ZOE	(cries)

ZOE	I don't know which way to go. 

JACK	Baby. I'm so sorry.

JACK	Hey, I'm sorry. It is gonna be all right. Okay? 

ZOE	I need to get to Billy.

JACK	We can't because it's not safe, okay? Come here. You heard what your brother said. Right?

ZOE	He's not my brother, and you're not my fucking dad. 

JACK	Hey, he is your brother.

ZOE	No, he's not. 

JACK	And I am your dad. And I have been for 16 years. And that is not going to change because you're pissed off at me at the moment, all right? Now something took Billy. Hey, and there's nothing that we can do about it. And we need to get out of here.

ZOE	My dad is dead.

ZOE	And now Billy is dead.

ZOE	And now Mom is dying, too. 

JACK	Your mom's not gonna die. Your mom is not gonna die. And we're gonna make it out of this

JACK	and she's gonna be fine. I promise. I promise. 

ZOE	She's not. She's not.

JACK	Okay. Come here. Come here. Come here. 

ZOE	No, no, no, no. 

JACK	Stop. Stop. Stop. 

ZOE	(crying) Billy. I need Billy.

JACK	He's gone, baby. He's gone. Okay?

ZOE	(crying) I need Billy. Please get me Billy back.

BILLY	(groans) 

BILLY	(groans)

JACK	Zoe. (hyenas laughing) Zoe. 

ZOE	What? 

JACK	Just, um…. 

JACK	You wait right here. 

ZOE	What? Fuck that.

ZOE AND JACK	Hey! 

ZOE	Hey!

JACK	Get out of here. Go on.

JACK	All right. They're gone. Are you okay? 

LAUREN	They will be back.

LAUREN	Jack, get in.

ZOE	(groans)

JACK	(groans)

LAUREN	They'll be back… 

LAUREN	with more.

BILLY	(breathing deeply) 

BILLY	(grunts)

BILLY	(grunts) 

JACK	Guys, we…we gotta get out of here.

ZOE	Where are we gonna go?

NOAH	Dad, I think I saw a camp from the top of the hill.

JACK	Okay, how far? 

NOAH	I don't know. Um, um, two miles…

NOAH	that way. I-I think it's north.

JACK	Hey, Lauren, can you walk?

LAUREN	You bet I can. 

JACK	Come on. Let's go.

JACK	Come on. Watch your head, baby. Come on.

NOAH	Dad. 

JACK	Thanks, bud. Hey, grab your mom's purse. Okay?

ZOE	So we're… we're gonna walk.

JACK	Yeah, I think we should. It's not just my decision. We all need to agree on this.

LAUREN	What choice do we have?

JACK	All right, then. Let's do this. 

LAUREN	All right.

BILLY	(shaking with sobs)

BILLY	(grunting)

BILLY	Okay. Okay.


BILLY	(breathes heavily)

BILLY	(grunting)

BILLY	(vomits)

JACK	Hey, hey, bud. Bud, we gotta stay on the main road. 

NOAH	It's this way. 

JACK	Yeah, but I think

JACK	if we stay on the main road, we have a better chance of someone driving by and finding us. 

NOAH	Dad, it's in this direction. 

LAUREN	Anyone driving by? We're on a closed road, Jack. 

JACK	Look, Noah.

JACK	I know that, honey, I remember that. 

LAUREN	Okay, I think we should follow Noah's lead. 

JACK	All right, fine. Let's just follow Noah's lead because my ideas are shit today, aren't they? Hey, bud.

JACK	Noah, it's just kind of important. Okay. Are you sure it's that way? 

NOAH	Yeah. II think so. Yes.

JACK	You think so or you know so, because this is a matter of life and death. 

ZOE	Don't bully him.

JACK	I'm not bullying him, Zoe. 

ZOE	You always do this. It's why he's so nervous all the time.

NOAH	I'm not nervous all the time.

JACK	You think I bully you?

NOAH	Yeah, sometimes. That's just your way, right?

JACK	(scoffs) 

NOAH	That's just how you are, right? 

JACK	What do you mean, how I am?

LAUREN	(whispers) Jack. 

JACK	You used to be able to handle my shit, bud. 

LAUREN	(sighs deeply) 

NOAH	Yes, Dad. I used to be able to handle your shit

NOAH	and I can still handle your shit. But it's this way. I saw it from the hill.

JACK	I'm sorry. It's just kind of important. Because if we go in there and it's wrong, we might never come out again.

NOAH	Yes, Dad. I understand that. I'm not a child. It is this way.

JACK	Okay then, I believe you. Let's go, bud. Let's go. 

ZOE	Let's hope he's right, Jack.

BILLY	Huh. Oh, thank you, divine goddess, (exhales) and also fuck you for doing this to me.

BILLY	Ha.

BILLY	Hey guys. Hey… Guys? (panting) What's going on?

JACK	Keep moving, okay? 

ZOE	Wait, wait, wait. No, we're going in circles.


ZOE	We already passed this tree, Jack. 

JACK	Baby, we have passed thousands of trees. How do you know we've passed this one before? 

ZOE	I recognize its face.

JACK	Its face?

NOAH	Never trust trees. They play tricks.

ZOE	What?

NOAH	Just something I heard.

JACK	Okay. Let's go.

ZOE	Can you listen to me for two seconds? I'm not a complete moron. We've been here before. 

JACK	Baby, no, we haven't. We have been walking in a straight line. 

ZOE	You know, you and I have the exact same amount of experience being lost in Africa.

ZOE	You do know that, right? 

JACK	Why do you always do this?

ZOE	Do what? 

JACK	Argue.

ZOE	Because not everybody who isn't you is as stupid as you think that they are.

JACK	That's very clever. 

LAUREN	Wait, she's right.

LAUREN	We were here 30 minutes ago.

JACK	No. No, we weren't. We, uh, come on.

JACK	Come on, baby. 

ZOE	You're an idiot. You're an idiot.

NOAH	Zoe? 

ZOE	What? 

NOAH	Don't talk to Dad like that. 

ZOE	You mean, your dad.

NOAH	No, I mean, our dad, Zoe. Come on. You're 18, not eight. Let's go.

NOAH	Come on.

ZOE	Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

JACK	(grunts) 

ZOE	Holy shit. 

NOAH	Oh, my God.

NOAH	What happened to its face?

LAUREN	Poachers took its horn.

ZOE	Oh, God. She had a baby.

JACK	This…

JACK	This is the rhino that… Wow, that is poetic justice, huh. 

ZOE	What the fuck? 

JACK	What!

ZOE	What the fuck 

JACK	That thing caused all of this. 

LAUREN TO JACK	She was just protecting her baby, Jack. We have to help it. 

JACK	How? We can't help that. We need to help you first. 

LAUREN	I'm not leaving it. 

JACK	We will come back. We will come back and make sure that baby's okay. I swear.

JACK	Come on. I promise.

LAUREN	I'm not leaving it, Jack. 

JACK	I swear. I swear.

JACK	We'll come back. Hm? I swear.

JACK	Come on. Come on.

NOAH	Mom? Mom? 

JACK	Hey, babe. Hey, baby. Grab her scarf. 

LAUREN	(vomiting)

LAUREN	Guys, I'm fine. I'm, it's, uh

JACK	Are you sure? 

LAUREN	I'm just dehydrated.

LAUREN	Let's keep moving forward, guys. Come on. 

JACK	She'll be okay. She'll be okay. 

MAN	There's nobody around. Shout. Shout. (indistinct). Can you say "Hello." Shout loudly. 

MAN	Hello? Anybody's there? 

MAN	Hello? Check it. Check it. 

MAN	Hello?

MAN	Aaah!!

LAUREN	Are you okay? 

JACK	I'm okay.

ZOE	Really?

LAUREN	Really? 

ZOE	A river. Didn't you see a river from the hill? 

NOAH	No. Sorry.

JACK	(unzips zipper) 

ZOE	Hey, Mom. 

LAUREN	Huh?

ZOE	Hey, are you okay? 

LAUREN	Yeah. I'm fine. 

ZOE	Are you sure? 

LAUREN	Mm.

JACK	All right. (exhales) Okay, well… we could be here. 

ZOE	Yeah, or here. 

NOAH	Or here. 

JACK	So we could be anywhere.

NOAH	Yes, but if we're here

ZOE	Yeah, or here.

NOAH	then these could be the buildings I saw. 

ZOE	Okay, that makes sense, right?

JACK	Why don't you figure that out?

NOAH	Zoe.

JACK	(grunting) Oh, shit.

LAUREN	You shouldn't be walking on that. 

JACK	(chuckles) What are you, a doctor? 

LAUREN	It's funny.

LAUREN	They teach you in medical school that… dying isn't nearly as painful as it looks from the outside. It's bunch of bullshit. This sucks.
JACK	You know we're gonna have to cross that river, right, baby?

JACK	(inhales and exhales deeply) I think you can do that. 

LAUREN	I think I can do that.

LAUREN	But I can't feel any of my limbs. 

JACK	(chuckles) 

LAUREN	(chuckles) 

JACK	Come on.

NOAH	You think we can drink it? 

ZOE	Sure. If you want to shit out maggots the rest of your life. 

NOAH	I'll take those odds right now. 

ZOE	(chuckles) 

JACK	Zoe, come here.

JACK	Noah, come here.

JACK	Okay. (panting) We've gotta cross the river. Now, I think we can wade to the sandbank there. And then swim the short distance to the other side.
ZOE	We're gonna swim an African river? Fuck that. There are crocodiles.

NOAH	Hyenas. Have they been tracking us?

NOAH	What are we gonna do? 

JACK	Okay.

JACK	Let's follow the edge of the river. Don't get too close to it. Okay? 

ZOE	Shit.


ZOE	Okay. Stay low. Come on.

JACK	There you go, baby. 

NOAH	Are you okay, Dad? 

JACK	Yeah, I'm okay. (grunts) There you go, baby

ZOE	Okay, we're good. Let's go. Let's go. 

JACK	I'm fine. I'm fine.

JACK	(grunts) 

ZOE	Let me help. 
JACK	No. It's okay, baby. I got it. 

ZOE	Dad…

ZOE	let me help. I've got this.

ZOE	Let me help. Okay. Okay? 

JACK	Yeah.

ZOE	I'm fine. Right here. Okay. Come on, Mom. Okay. 

NOAH	I got her. 

ZOE	Oh, my God. I got it.

NOAH	Get down. 

ZOE	Okay. 

NOAH	Whoa.

ZOE	I got it.

ZOE	Shit. 

NOAH	Are you okay? 

ZOE	Yeah.

NOAH	Zoe, Zoe, Zoe, go first.

NOAH	Dad, they're coming. 

JACK	I know, I know. I see it. 

ZOE	I got it. I got it. 

NOAH	Shit.

JACK	Oh my God. Come here.

NOAH	What do we do?

JACK	Shh.

ALL	Hey! Hey! 

ZOE	Down here. Over here.

JACK	Down here.

JACK	Oh, my God. My god, I can't tell you how happy I am to see you.

MITCH	Oil man. 

JACK	Hah. 

MITCH	What the hell are you doing out here? 

MAN 1	Stay right there. I'm I'm getting some help.

MAN 1	Help! Help! Come fast.

MAN 1	There's a man in the car. Come, come. He's hurt.

MAN 1	We found him outside in the van.

MAN 1	We found him in the forest. Blood everywhere. 

LUCAS	(into comms) 

MAN 1	We must get him help quicks.

MAN 1	Slowly. Be careful. I'll hold him.

BILLY	I think it was somewhere around here. I don't know, we went off road. I wasn't paying attention.

LUCAS	That's impossible. I mean, all the vehicles in the park are accounted for.

BILLY	No, we drove through without paying and never checked in. 

DOCTOR	Okay. We need to move him out.

WOMAN	Get everybody ready. We're going out.

MAN 1	(panting) 

MITCH	We have new friends, Charlie.

MITCH	Here we go. Charlie's got you.

MITCH	There you go.

MITCH	Hey, uh, Charlie, is camp ready for guests? 

CHARLIE	Yeah, we're good, boss. 

MITCH	Okay. Code Jenny. Code Jenny, let's go. 

JACK	Thank you so much. 

MITCH	Yeah, it's not a problem. You guys will be fine. What were you doing out there? 

JACK	You have no idea what we've been through. 

MITCH	It's fine. You're all okay. Put him…put him by the fire. 

JACK	(groans) 

MITCH	By the fire. You guys will be fine now. 

MITCH	There we go. 

JACK	(grunts) Thank you. 

MAN 2	(speaking in foreign language) 

JACK	Baby. (indistinct). 

MITCH	What is going on with her? 

JACK	She's diabetic. She needs insulin. 

MITCH	Insulin? We don't have insulin.

MITCH	The nearest medical center is two hours away.

JACK	Can you call for help? She's dying.

MITCH	How long does she have? 

JACK	Not long. Please call someone.

JACK	Call anyone. 

MITCH	Got the sat phone.

JACK	Thank you. 

MITCH	See if we can get a signal. 

JACK	Thank you.

MITCH	It's okay. Getting a signal here.

MITCH	I'm trying to get a signal.

MITCH	These things are always supposed to have a signal.

MITCH	Come on. Why is there no signal?

MITCH	This is crazy. Sat phones are always supposed to give you a signal here.

MITCH	Hold on.

CHARLIE	I wish you hadn't seen that.

JACK	Seen what?

JACK	Zoe, what's going on?

ZOE	They're poachers, Dad. 

JACK	What? 

ZOE	They're poachers. 

MITCH	No, no, no. Ssshhh. No, no, no.

MITCH	We do not like to use… the P-word.

MITCH	It's like I said back at the airport, when we first met. We help indigenous people make the best use of their resources.
ZOE	By butchering wildlife? 

JACK	Right now…II don't care what you do.

NOAH	Dad, they killed that

JACK	Stop, Noah. No, no, stop. Okay? It's none of our business. We…we just need your help.

ZOE	Oh my God, they aren't gonna help us. Who are you?

MITCH	No.

CHARLIE	(speaks foreign language)

MITCH	Tie them up.

JACK	(grunts)

JACK	(sighs)

ZOE	Hey, asshole.

ZOE	Yeah, you. 

MITCH	(laughs) 

ZOE	You know how many rhino are left?

CHARLIE	Enough to make them valuable?

MITCH	Valuable enough for these men to earn more in one night than they would the whole year.

MITCH	Enough to feed their families.

ZOE	You're disgusting.

MITCH	(speaking in foreign language)

MITCH	Do you think their children should starve?

ZOE	No, I don't think their children should starve.

MITCH	Well, so then we… we agree.

MITCH	That they have the right to benefit from their own land.

MITCH	From their own heritage.

MITCH	What gives you the right? Some privileged, ignorant, white 

ZOE	(spits) Fuck off. 

MITCH	(speaks foreign language)

ZOE	Fuck off. 

MITCH	(speaks foreign language) to dictate anything these people do.

ZOE	Dad? 

JACK	I'm sure that you're making a healthy profit

JACK	out of them. 

ZOE	Fuck off.

CHARLIE	Let's just call capitalism, my friend.

CHARLIE	Youyou work in the oil business, right?

MITCH	Charlie's right. Charlie is absolutely right.

MITCH	Oil man, you're not allowed to get all holier than thou with us.

MITCH	I mean, whatwhat is the worst that we do?

CHARLIE	Yeah. 

MITCH	A few less rhinos in the world.

MITCH	Maybe an elephant?

MITCH	A pangolin. You know how much this is worth?

MITCH	It's worth more than its weight in gold.

MITCH	(sighs) And we're nothing compared to you.

MITCH	Don't even compare.

MITCH	We're amateurs.

MITCH	You're planet killers.

MITCH	I gotta admit, that's pretty impressive.

NOAH	What do you… what are you gonna do to us? 

MITCH	Well, the end of your story… is easy.

MITCH	Obviously, Mom's about to die. So that's easy.

MITCH	As for the rest of you, we are going to move out.

MITCH	We usually let the hyenas clean up after us, though they prefer their animals injured, so might let my men go to work on you for a little bit.
MITCH	Though it looks like… Dad is already a little injured there.

JACK	(grunting) Stop, please.

NOAH	No. Stop! Stop.

JACK	(groans)

NOAH	Stop it!

JACK	(groans)

MITCH	The rest is easy.

MITCH	Arrogant American family comes to Africa.

MITCH	Africa embraces arrogant American family.

MITCH	Gentlemen, sorry to keep you waiting.

MITCH	Sorry about that. Great to see you again. Jin. Always a pleasure. Thanks for coming out.

MITCH	Sorry about the whole blindfold and

NOAH	She's gonna die.

ZOE	Don't say that. 

NOAH	She is.

JACK	No, she is, if we don't get out of here.

NOAH	What's gonna happen to us? 

ZOE	You heard him.

ZOE	They're gonna kill us. 

JACK	No, no, they're not. They're not. They're just

ZOE	Oh my God. Of course, they fucking are. Jesus, Dad. 

JACK	I was just…

JACK	I'm just trying to stay positive. Okay?

NOAH	Why don't you just tell us something truthful?

JACK	I'm sorry. That's the truth. 

ZOE	No, Dad. You don't…

ZOE	Forget it. You don't have to do that now. 

JACK	It's okay. 

ZOE	Please. I 

JACK	No, no. Now is the now is the perfect time.

ZOE	No. 

JACK	We might not have any time left.

ZOE	(sobs)

JACK	(sighs) I'm sorry I haven't been a very good father.

JACK	I'm sorry that I couldn't see what was important until everything was falling apart around me.

JACK	It's okay. It's okay.

JACK	I love your mother. And I love you both so much.

JACK	And I know, I know I didn't say that enough. And Noah…

JACK	I just wanted you to be happy, bud.

JACK	Yeah. 

ZOE	(cries) 

JACK	You are who you are, so fucking what to everything else, right?

JACK	Hey…

JACK	I'm so proud of you. And I love you so much. Zoe, I love you too.

JACK	I've loved you from the moment I met you and your mother. 

ZOE	(cries)

JACK	You're my daughter, and I'm your father. Even…even if you say I'm not. You'll still be my daughter, okay?

ZOE	(indistinct mutter) 

JACK	Yeah. I'm so proud of you. And I only push college because… because you are so damn smart.

JACK	And I can see the woman, the beautiful woman that you are becoming.

JACK	And the world needs people like that. Great people who change things for the better. Not people like me, huh.
JACK	Money and selfishness. It's nothing. The world is not about stuff. It is about family. It is about this.

JACK	And I am…

JACK	I am proud of you both

JACK	because you are nothing like me.

JACK	And I fucked things up

JACK	pretty badly but not…

JACK	not this time.

MITCH	I was thinking…

NOAH	(groans) 

JACK	You got it?

NOAH	Yeah.

NOAH	Yeah.

JACK	Get your sister. Get your sister.

JACK	Okay, guys, look at me. 

ZOE	Okay.

JACK	You see that jeep over there?

JACK	Right over there? 

NOAH	Yeah. 

JACK	Yeah, good. Noah, I need you to be strong

JACK	and I mean properly strong, okay. You've gotta carry your mother.

JACK	Zoe, you gotta drive that jeep, baby. 

ZOE	No. Whywhy can't you drive?

JACK	Somebody needs to distract them. That's me. Now, listen. 

NOAH	Dad. 

JACK	Listen, listen. Look. Listen, I love you both… very much.

JACK	You are my everything. You'll know. 

NOAH	(cries) 

JACK	You'll know.

MITCH	Do we have a deal?

JACK	(grunting)

JACK	(grunting)

POACHER 1	Look over there. He's getting away.

POACHER 1	Stop him.

POACHER 2	I've got him, boss; I've got him.

JACK	You gotta be kidding me.

JACK	You gotta be kidding me.

MITCH	Hey. (speaks foreign language)

MITCH	Thank you. (speaking in foreign language) (laughs) Look at this, Charlie.

MITCH	We're going oil-man huntin'.

MITCH	Your father's dead.

JACK	(grunts) 

MITCH	(speaking in foreign language)

MITCH	Charlie. You're with me.

ZOE	You know, we're gonna go to those jeeps, okay? All right. Okay.

MITCH	Keep the light on him.

MITCH	Where are you going, oil man?

MITCH	Come here.

MITCH	He cannot still be alive.

MITCH	He cannot be still alive. 

JACK	(panting)

MITCH	Oil man, I gotta apologize to you.

MITCH	(breathes heavily) I'm normally way more accurate.

MITCH	Oh yeah. I winged him good. 

JACK	(grunting)

MITCH	Sorry about that.

MITCH	It's gonna leave a mark there. You know, (panting) Charlie and me…

MITCH	we've hunted pretty much everything. You're our first human.

CHARLIE	First human. 

MITCH	It's a shame we can't keep his head. 

JACK	My family.
