Patricia	He’s almost done.You’re doing just fine.			
Woman	Thanks. It’s not so bad.			
Dr. Guy	Well. One last push. You ready?			
Woman	I think so, Dr. Guy			
Dr. Guy	Well, alright.			
Patricia	Doctor?			
Dr. Guy	Yes, Patty?			
Patricia	I think there’s a little more.			
Dr. Guy	Where Well, I guess there was. That should be it.			
Woman	Thank you so much, Dr. Guy. I feel like a whole new person.			
Dr. Guy	It was my pleasure. I insist.			
Tammie	What happened?			
Patricia	Nothing.			
Tammie	You sure you don’t want to talk about it?			
Patricia	Guy’s just being really difficult this morning.			
Tammie	Probably nervous today.			
Patricia	But why?			
Tammie	The patent examiners are coming.			
Patricia	No. They’re not coming today.			
Tammie	He didn’t tell you?			
Sherman	Hello? I believe it’s my turn to be seen now.			
Tammie	Sir.			
Sherman	You just called my name. Sherman. Eugene Sherman?			
Tammie	No, sir. Go sit down.			
Sherman	Well don’t call my name if you’re not ready.			
Tammie	He's been doing that all day.			
Patricia	What’s going on?			
Tammie	The patent examiners are coming back.			
Patricia	No.			
Tammie	Why is that a problem?			
Patricia	Because last time didn’t go so well. If they are coming, I am done here.			
Tammie	Well, they’re definitely coming soon… What happened last time?			
Patricia	This happened. His machine is dangerous.			
Tammie	He says it’s ready now.			
Patricia	He said that before… Okay let’s just get my last day over with.			
Tammie	Yes ma’am.			
Patricia	Thank you.			
Tammie	Now seeing Carol			
Sherman	Uh are you sure you don’t want to see Mr. Sherman? I thought I heard another name. Maybe there’s a mix up.			
Carol	I’m Carol.			
Patricia	Carol, please follow me. Please have a seat, sir. Won’t take long. How are you doing?			
Carol	I’m doing okay thank you very much… Weather’s a bit cold but, I can’t complain.			
Patricia	Thanks for coming in today. We’ll get you fixed right up.			
Carol	Thanks so much.			
Patricia	After you.			
Carol	Thanks.			
Patricia	Please have a seat. I’ll need to do a routine check up before we get started.			
Carol	Okay			
Patricia	Tammie said you’ve got a small spot on your neck?			
Carol	Yes ma’am, I do.			
Patricia	Let’s have a look at it.			
Carol	I think my boyfriend might have left me because of that.			
Patricia	Oh no. Then this boy wasn’t worth it. You’re beautiful inside and out. It’s a sebaceous cyst.			
Carol	Oh no.			
Patricia	No, no. It’s non cancerous. So you’ll be just fine… And Dr. Guy’s a specialist for this so you’re in good hands… Would you like a gown?			
Carol	Yes please.			
Patricia	Let me brief him quickly and I’ll be right back.			
Carol	Sounds just fine.			
Patricia	I’ll be right back.			
Dr. Guy	The laser creates a clean incision on the area. I’ve tested it on numerous test subjects.			
Preston	Like rats?			
Dr. Guy	No! Human tissue son.			
Preston	Right. Of course.			
Dr. Guy	You think you might do it for me today?			
Preston	I mean…yeah sure.			
Dr. Guy	I might even hire you full time.			
Preston	Oh gosh that would be great. I could really use the extra money right now.			
Dr. Guy	Let's not talk about that just yet.  You can’t put a price tag on experience.			
Patricia	We need to talk.			
Dr. Guy	Okay.			
Patricia	Alone… Preston, could you give us a minute?			
Preston	Yeah, sure.			
Patricia	How could you?			
Dr. Guy	What?			
Patricia	You know.			
Dr. Guy	Okay relax, Patty. It’s gonna work this time.			
Patricia	I told you if you ever used this machine again, I quit.			
Dr. Guy	Well if you feel that way we’ll do fine without you. The intern’s working out just fine.			
Patricia	I mean it.			
Dr. Guy	Look I’m sure someone’s gonna come along and take you. Just remember to find that paperwork. You’re gonna need it.			
Patricia	I can’t believe you.			
Dr. Guy	Well you might want to start… Seat our next patient, Patty. This is a good one. Nice and juicy. Can you feel that?			
Carol	Barely… I think Patricia said it was a bodacious cyst. Is that true? I just want to make sure it’s not cancerous.			
Dr. Guy	Sebaceous cyst. I’m sorry she told you the wrong name. Look it’s nothing to worry about. We’ll get this out sooner than later, okay?			
Carol	Okay.			
Dr. Guy	Did she tell you that today is her last day?			
Carol	No she didn’t. I’m really sorry to hear that.			
Dr. Guy	We are too. We are too. Can you feel that?… How was that?			
Carol	Not too bad.			
Dr. Guy	Well, Carol on a scale of one to ten how would you rate it for pain?			
Carol	Probably a four.			
Dr. Guy	Four? I’m afraid that’s high for this type of procedure. I’m afraid it’s going to get a lot more painful if that’s the way it feels now.			
Carol	It is?			
Dr. Guy	Carol? I’d like to offer you an exclusive. That I do for certain patients with this type of pain tolerance.			
Carol	Okay.			
Dr. Guy	I’ve invented a machine that virtually performs this operation pain free. And it removes the cyst just like that… I call it, the Get Gone.			
Carol	Oh thank you so very much, Dr. Guy but I’d really I’m think I’m gonna-			
Dr. Guy	Well I insist that you think about this. because it’s much healthier for you and if you’re worried about a little scarring I’ve got a special cream for that			
Carol	Oh, I appreciate the offer but-			
Dr. Guy	We’ll even offer half price.			
Carol	Thank you so much that is very generous.			
Dr. Guy	I’ll slice the fees even more.			
Carol	This is starting to feel uncomfortable.			
Dr. Guy	Well what if-			
Patricia	She said no!			
Dr. Guy	Okay. Let’s just do it the old fashioned way. The more expensive way. The less efficient way. The less practical way. And the much more painful way. Now, let’s get started. Well how was that?			
Carol	I think you just caught me by surprise a little bit.			
Dr. Guy	You wanna use the Get Gone?			
Carol	Oh no I			
Dr. Guy	Wow. There was a little more in there than I thought. Okay go get Clarence to clean this mess up. Thank you very much Patty. Hey Carol. Today’s Patty’s last day. Can you believe that?			
Carol	Yeah. You already told me.			
Dr. Guy	Clarence!			
Clarence	Sorry. This danged bucket.			
Dr. Guy	For the love of God, can’t you see I’m operating? Every time with this danged guy.			
Dr. Guy	We’re all excited because Peter here’s our new intern.			
Preston	Preston.			
Dr. Guy	He’s gonna take Patty’s place.  We are so excited because he’s gonna pop some life into this area. Aren’t you boy?			
Preston	Yeah, sure.			
Dr. Guy	Patty, let’s let Preston do the stitches today. I know it’s his first time but you’re okay with that aren’t you, Carol?			
Carol	Um… I-			
Dr. Guy	Well you wouldn’t have to use stitches if you used the Get Gone.			
Carol	But…But-			
Dr. Guy	Oh I like that one too. Patty, the patent examiners are supposed to be here any minute. Carol was supposed to be our test subject but that didn’t happen so I was wondering if you guys would.			
Patricia	No!			
Dr. Guy	No what?			
Patricia	If you think I’m letting you-			
Dr. Guy	I figured you’d back out. Good thing we got trusty Peyton.			
Patricia/Preston	Preston.			
Dr. Guy	Well what about you boy? You got anything against saving people’s lives 			
Preston	I mean… I don’t… I don’t..			
Dr. Guy	You can do it.			
Preston	I don't 			
Dr. Guy	You can do it.			
Preston	I won’t let you down Dr. Guy.			
Dr. Guy	That’s what I like to hear… Patty go out and welcome our guests to the front. … Let’s find us a growth.			
Tammie	You okay?			
Patricia	Well it looks like today’s my last day here.			
Tammie	At least one of us is getting out of here alive.			
Patricia	I’ve got a bad feeling about this.			
Tammie	What are you saying?			
Patricia	He's different.			
Tammie	Like losing his mind?… He lost that a long time ago.			
Patricia	True.			
Sherman	Me?			
Patricia	No.			
Sherman	Dang.			
Dr. Guy	That looks a little small.			
Preston	I thought it was acne.			
Dr. Guy	You got any other spots I don’t know about?			
Preston	None that I’m aware of.			
Dr. Guy	I’m gonna put some treatment on this to make absolutely sure we get the full potential of the Get Gone.			
Preston	What do you mean?			
Dr. Guy	I'm gonna grow this so that it gets bigger. Small price to pay to get you down in the history books.			
Preston 	I just want to keep my job, sir.			
Dr. Guy	Well keep it up and you might not have to worry about working again. Heck you might even get paid if you’re lucky.			
Preston	Ow!			
Della	I don't think that you listen.			
Al	Well this whole thing is wrong.			
Della	You are wrong…Oh hello Patricia. It is so nice to see you again.			
Patricia	Della… Al. Thanks for coming in today.			
Bill	Bill. Pleased to meet you Mrs. Patricia.			
Patricia	Oh it’s just Miss. Pleasure to meet you too.			
Al	Let's just get this thing started. And over with.			
Patricia	Shall we?			
Sherman	Me.			
Patricia	Right this way.			
Della	So, what is different about his machine this time?			
Patricia	He’s making changes all the time.			
Al	Does it work? Last time it was a disaster.			
Bill	I'm sure he’s made improvements. 			
Della	Well I hope so because this is his last chance.			
Bill	Patricia, can you explain the device?			
Patricia	The machine is supposed to make skin removal operations less painful, more efficient, and affordable.			
Bill	Well that’s it. That could cut down the use of metal tools and certain infections. I mean it would dramatically raise the health scores up for all general practices.			
Patricia	That's the idea.			
Dr. Guy	Oh my gosh. It’s so good to see you again. Thank you all so much for coming. It means the world to me from the bottom of my heart… But I do have some terrible news. It’s Patty's last day.			
Al	My condolences to Patricia. But we need to get this thing moving. We need to get out of here.			
Dr. Guy	I thought we had all morning.			
Al	No, no. We talked abut this.			
Della	We did.			
Al	More than twice. One hour and we are out.			
Della	Out the door.			
Dr. Guy	I was just gonna say-			
Al	This is not going to be an all dayer like last time.			
Della	Not like last time.			
Al	The clock starts now.			
Dr. Guy	Okay. Well this new version of the Get Gone works so well that our trusty intern here, Presto, has volunteered to be our patient today. He’ll be explaining the machine. Presto…. Presto, just read it.			
Preston	This unit comes provided with ultraviolet lidoscope tube and interstellar processor, a warp cabobulator			
Della	A warped what?			
Dr. Guy	Cabobulator.			
Preston	And a thermite compactor.			
Dr. Guy	If you want to follow along a little bit more, just read this. Great information.			
Preston	This unit comes with a patented quasar incapascillator…This… I’m gonna do it again. This new unit features a patented-			
Al	It's not patented yet.			
Dr. Guy	Look this… Get Gone. Patented vulcanized hyper vacuum.			
Della	Not patented!			
Dr. Guy	That sucks the infected area down the glide tube into the patented anti nuclear sac.			
Della/Al	It’s not patented!			
Dr. Guy	Pending…I gotta work on this machine. Patty, just read this.			
Patricia	Why get upset when you can got a Get Gone. When you got a cyst as big as a fist. Get Gone. When you’ve got a growth your grown to loath, Get Gone.			
Dr. Guy	That was amazing. Thank you so much Patty. She really wanted to do it.			
Patricia	No I didn’t.			
Dr. Guy	This is the area we’ll be working on today.			
Al	That thing’s a lot smaller than last time.			
Della	Much smaller.			
Dr. Guy 	I’m not getting a patent on the cyst.			
Della	We want to see it work on something larger. You could remove that with tweezers… This isn’t life threatening.			
Dr. Guy	Let’s talk about the machine. Let’s talk about the damned machine!			
Patricia	Doctor you might want to give it a second before you-			
Della	What's happening?			
Dr. Guy	Must have held the buttons down too long.			
Al	No your machine went kaput on its own. It’s a failure again, doc. Listen, we’re out of here. I don’t have time for this. And I don’t want to get any more of your sob story letters. We’re done.			
Dr. Guy	The power converter needs a new nuclear fuse. And we still have… 45 minutes.			
Al	We are out of here.			
Dr. Guy	You’re wasting time now.			
Della	We really need to go.			
Dr. Guy	I pay my damned taxes and I’m gonna get my 45 minutes. Patty. Take them next door to the diner….Let’s go. Let’s go! Let’s go.			
Patricia	Sorry about that.			
Al	Well I’m not gonna say no to a free lunch.	 I remember this place from last time. Guess this trip won’t be a total bust.			
Della	The sausage is great.			
Al	Biscuits and gravy. That’s what I’m doing.			
Bill	I wonder if they have grits.			
Al	Gross.			
Bill	I’ve never tried grits before.			
Al	Consider yourself lucky.			
Patricia	I’ll have grits with you, Bill.			
Al	Of course you will.			
Waiter	What can I get for you guys?			
Patricia	We're sort of in a rush. We need one order of B and G’s, fruit, two orders of grits, sausage, and two eggs sunny side up, and four coffees. Thank you.			
Waiter	Wow. Aren’t you special.			
Patricia	Sorry that Dr. Guy’s being a little bit cranky today, but I think he’s just nervous.			
Al	It’s your last day, isn’t it?			
Patricia	Yes. It is.			
Della	Bet you’re happy.			
Bill	So what are you going to do now?			
Patricia	I might start selling my own jewelry.			
Bill	You make jewelry? I’d love see something you’ve designed.			
Patricia	Dr. Guy is wearing a copper bracelet around his wrist. I made it for him.			
Bill	I'll check it out.			
Della	So you’re getting out of the health field.			
Patricia	Well I might go back some day. Sometimes a change of scenery does wonders.			
Bill	I think that’s really smart.			
Patricia	Thank you, Bill.			
Al	So, Patricia Is there anything you want to tell us before we go back over. I mean Guy’s been throwing himself into his machine for years. Frankly I’ve never seen a need for it.			
Della	Never seen a need for it. Especially after what happened to you last time.			
Al	Yeah. How’s your arm?			
Patricia	Couldn’t be better, thanks.			
Bill	Wait. What happened? Well if you don’t mind me asking.			
Al	Maybe we shouldn’t bring it up.			
Patricia	No. It’s fine really. Last time Dr. Guy got a little too excited during the test and he turned the power up too high. Luckily the machine turned off after a few moments.			
Della	Did that laser incision leave any scarring?			
Patricia	No. Not at all. Oh did I tell you that Dr. Guy began working on an ointment that will rejuvenates damaged cells?			
Al	Rejuvenating damaged cells? Are we going to get a chance to see that today?			
Patricia	No. That’s definitely not ready yet.			
Dr. Guy	They wanted it bigger. They wanted it bigger.			
Preston	Dr. Guy?  What are you doing?			
Dr. Guy	I’m getting my damned patent.			
Al	That was delicious.  Shall we?			
Della	We don’t have much time left.			
Patricia	Oh don’t worry about the check. It’s on Dr. Guy.			
Bill	You sure? Thank you.			
Della	You know Patricia, since this is your last day and all I think it’s safe for me to say I always thought Dr. Guy was a little crazy. I mean what kind of guy obsesses over a machine like that?			
Al	We see a lot of machines in our line don’t we, Del. We see a lot of machines. Mostly food related. That’s the kind I like  I’ll tell you what. This thing is-			
Della	Bizarre.			
Al	Bizarre. Never seen anything like it.			
Della	Weirdest thing I ever seen.			
Patricia	Well you know what they say. It takes a crazy person to-			
Bill	Change the world.			
Della	Who the hell says that?			
Sherman	Well I’ve been here for an eternity.			
Tammie	Your appointment is for 2 o’clock. It’s 12:20. That’s not even early. That’s just dumb.			
Sherman	I need this thing off me or else I’m gonna walk out of here now. Thank goodness. Ready?			
Patricia	No. Preston?… Are you okay?… Something wrong?			
Dr. Guy	That's how I feel. Now where’s my lunch?			
Patricia	What?			
Dr. Guy	My stomach’s so danged empty. Where is it?			
Patricia	I didn’t know-			
Dr. Guy	Get on with it. What?			
Patricia	I didn’t know you wanted me to-			
Dr. Guy	Didn’t know? You didn’t know did you? You didn’t know. Don’t worry. I’ll be just fine. Last day. Gonna miss you so much…. Well, well, well I hope you all had a nice lunch cause you know what? I didn’t get one. But today is the day that you’re gonna come here and see what you’ve all been waiting for. Patty, please show our guests to their seats. Patty, get to it.			
Al	You got five minutes and we are out of here.			
Della	Out the door.			
Dr. Guy	Well great! Great! Are you okay with that? Five minutes… Is it big enough now?			
Preston	What is it?… What.  What is it?			
Dr. Guy	Patty. Do the blessing. Do the blessing Patty.			
Patricia	Okay.			
Dr. Guy	Do the blessing Do the song note blessing. Quickly!… Quiet. Quiet. Stop it! As you can see, the laser is working.			
Al	Pugsley. How does it feel?			
Preston	It hurts.			
Dr. Guy	Great. I’m going to turn it up to three.			
Al	You have one minute left, Guy.			
Della	Turn it off! turn that thing off.			
Bill	Doctor!			
Patricia	It’s stuck to the skin. Turn it off!			
Della	Do something! Do Something!			
Patricia	Oh my God!			
Al	Time’s up, Guy. We’re out of here. This time I’m shutting you down for good.			
Patricia	What have you done? You knew it wasn’t ready.			
Dr. Guy	I'm getting that patent.			
Sherman	That’s it. I’m outta here. Adios			
Tammie	Eww.			
Sherman	Ha ha. Ha ha. It’s gone… Gone.			
Patricia	Is this on the doors too?			
Dr. Guy	I just. Just hold on, Patty.			
Patricia	But why?			
Dr. Guy	Just..Just..I did a little lockdown procedure. That’s all.			
Patricia	With a way out?			
Dr. Guy	Just relax Patty.			
Patricia	When the clock hits five, I’m out!			
Della	Hey! Hey, I need some help here. Somebody help me. Come on give me some help. Look it’s not doing anything. It’s just kind of sitting there. This is a doctor’s office right? This is your specialty. Right. Come on. Help me. I’ll do anything. Your patent.			
Dr. Guy	The patent.			
Della	Yes I’ll give you your damned patent. Help me. Come on…. Somebody help me.			
Patricia	Clarence, where did you get that?			
Clarence	Sorry. It’s always good to be ready.			
Tammie	Are all the doors and windows locked down?			
Patricia	It looks like it.			
Clarence	We're not breaking through that metal. It’s made for a nuclear fallout shelter.			
Tammie	He didn't build an exit?			
Patricia	I don’t know.			
Tammie	Are you kidding me?			
Clarence	What about the monster lady? You want me to shoot her?			
Patricia	No. We just need to get that cyst off her. It’s just a cyst. I think. I hope… Let’s go.			
Patricia	Put that down.			
Dr. Guy	I need y’alls help.			
Clarence	I'm not going in there.			
Patricia	We have to save her.			
Clarence	No I ain’t going.			
Patricia	I’m going in.			
Dr. Guy	I need y’alls help			
Clarence	We’re going in there?			
Dr. Guy 	Come on.			
Clarence	Oh, whoa whoa whoa.			
Dr. Guy	The Get Gone is ready. It’s the only way.			
Della	I'll do anything. I’ll give you your patent. Please. Just get that thing off of me.			
Tammie	Can't we just cut it off?			
Dr. Guy	Oh God that is so stupid. Where did you come up with that idea? That’s why I’m the doctor and you’re the receptionist.			
Patricia	Really? You want to laser it off?			
Dr. Guy	Exactly.			
Della	No please Guy don’t do that. Please. Am I dead?			
Patricia	Clarence. That’s not going to-			
Della	Is it dead?			
Dr. Guy	Are you gonna clean that up?			
Tammie	We’re screwed.			
Dr. Guy	Yeah. She hasn’t even given us the patent yet… Let’s get that thing off.			
Patricia	Just be careful this time.			
Dr. Guy	Vacuum off. Laser on. Let’s blast this thing.			
Della	Oh thank God.			
Dr. Guy	It worked. It worked.			
Tammie	It worked. It worked.			
Della	Oh doctor Guy. As soon as I get out of here I am going to sign that patent paperwork.			
Dr. Guy	You mean it?			
Della	As I live and breathe.			
Dr. Guy	It worked.			
Patricia	Shut your stupid mouth. People are dead right now. This is no time to think about your patent.			
Dr. Guy	Just trying to be positive.			
Patricia	I think you made it angry. We need to trap it and come up with a plan.			
Clarence	Yeah. Yeah.			
Tammie	Did you get her?			
Clarence	Yeah, I locked her in the closet.			
Tammie	Good work Clarence.			
Clarence	Not sure I should have put her in there but it’s alright. It’s alright.			
Dr. Guy	Is there a problem?			
Clarence	No, no. No problem.			
Tammie	Let's just get out of here.			
Patricia	Is there an exit?			
Dr. Guy	Not exactly.			
Tammie	What does that mean?			
Patricia	It means no.			
Tammie	You got any dynamite, or anything else in here that we don’t know about that might actually help?			
Patricia	The laser might be able to melt the door.			
Dr. Guy	It's not big enough.			
Patricia	Couldn’t we amplify it?			
Tammie	What the hell? What the hell?			
Patricia	What is this noise?			
Clarence	I have a confession. I may have been stashing some sharp metallic utensils in that closet.			
Tammie	Stashing?			
Clarence	Amassing might be a better word.			
Dr. Guy	That's why I’ve been having to buy scalpels every week.			
Clarence	Well yeah. I’m a sculptor. You know how expensive metal supplies are.			
Dr. Guy	You're fired.			
Clarence	Patricia was leaving. I was gonna quit anyways.			
Patricia	Where’s Clarence?			
Dr. Guy	Probably just sculpting.			
Tammie	What's happening?			
Dr. Guy	Now you all just calm down. It’ll be fine.			
Patricia	I think it’s gone.			
Tammie	You sure?			
Bill	Hello?			
Tammie	Someone’s out there.			
Dr. Guy	Who?			
Bill	What happened?			
Patricia	Bill?!			
Bill	Patricia. Patricia is that you?			
Patricia	What are you doing?			
Dr. Guy	You’re not going out there.			
Bill	I can't see.			
Patricia	Let me go. I’m not going to let him die.			
Dr. Guy	He's already dead. It’s the cyst monster acting like Bill.			
Patricia	Bill. Bill… Okay fine. You’re the worst doctor ever.			
Dr. Guy	You’re the worst nurse ever.			
Patricia	This is the worst job I ever had.			
Dr. Guy	Well good luck getting a referral from me.	 You’re not leaving me. I love you!			
Patricia	I hate you!			
Tammie	Damn.			
Bill	Patricia? Patricia are you in there?			
Tammie	Hell. I’ll do it. I’m going to get you.	 If you all wouldn’t have been fighting we probably could have saved him.			
Dr. Guy	It's her fault.			
Tammie	What are we gonna do now?			
Patricia	We’re going to kill that thing.			
Tammie	We stay in this room any longer and you all are going to kill each other.			
Dr. Guy	Probably.			
Tammie	How bout we go out front. As far away from that thing as possible.			
Dr. Guy	I already told her I love her. I’m not going out there.			
Patricia	Oh stop it.			
Tammie	Shut up. I’m tired of hearing your mouth.			
Patricia	So you’re sure that there’s no way to reverse the lockdown.			
Dr. Guy	Only in case of emergencies.			
Patricia	What?			
Dr. Guy	Fine. There’s a breaker in the basement with a reversal switch but I’m not going down there. The doors don’t work and I don’t know what else is down there.			
Patricia	Wait. So if I pull that switch we can get out of here?			
Dr. Guy	Of course. I’m not an idiot.			
Patricia	Alright. I’ll go down and after I hit that switch I’ll come back so Tammie, please find a way to distract the cyst for our exit.			
Dr. Guy	Got it. Patty, if you need my help.			
Patricia	Oh my God.			
Tammie	You should go check on her.			
Dr. Guy	She’ll be fine.			
Tammie	If you really love her you should go.			
Dr. Guy	Only said that to win the fight.			
Tammie	Look. You can’t lie to me. I know what’s going on. You’re mad at her for leaving and this is just payback.			
Dr. Guy	That's preposterous.			
Patricia	Tammie! 			
Dr. Guy	Go away.			
Tammie	You got a plan?			
Dr. Guy	Not yet.			
Tammie	You’re hurt aren’t you? Maybe it just wants to be wanted. Or loved.			
Dr. Guy	What?			
Tammie	Come here, Cyst. I know how you feel. All those things, you just want some lovin’ and no one wants you clinging on. I’m clingy too. It just means we care a little bit more than others.			
Dr. Guy	Tammie. No that’s a bad idea. No Tammie, No.			
Tammie	It's okay. He’s not going to hurt me. I can see it in his eye, You're not what they think you are.  Come here baby. See. It’s working	A little closer.			
Dr. Guy	Tammie! No! No. Fuckin’ No.			
Patricia	Let me go. Let me go.			
Dr. Guy	The Get One is ready. Let’s use it.			
Patricia	But we have to find a way to amplify the laser and destroy the cyst.			
Dr. Guy	Well all the tools are inside it.			
Patricia	What about you exam mirror.			
Dr. Guy	It’s over there in the cabinet			
Patricia	When the laser hits it, it will magnify the beam			
Dr. Guy	That could work.			
Patricia	Yes. It must work.			
Dr. Guy	Patty? Have you always hated me?			
Patricia	No. It just took me so long to find out who you really are. It's coming.			
Dr. Guy	One of us will have to be in here with it.			
Patricia	But we can work this out. I’m sure we can.	 Open the door. Open the god damned door.			
Dr. Guy	Last day. Gonna miss you so much.			
Patricia	No. No please.			
Dr. Guy	Looks like you’re gonna be out of here by five after all.			
Patricia	 Give that back. I insist! Get gone.
