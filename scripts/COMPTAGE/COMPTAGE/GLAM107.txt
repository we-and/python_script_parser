ELECTRA	I’m Crystal’s twin. I’m strong and determined like her, I have just one little weakness.. let’s say that I am slightly superstitious. In particular I’m terrified of the color purple. Brrr!

MANCUSO	...and so, each of you should exercise on a different colored velvet...there: I’ve brought them for you from one of my trips. Electra, this is for you...

ELECTRA	Purple? Oh nooo!

ELECTRA	But yeah, go on, nothing will happen! (Reactions)… Oh dear...

REBECCA	Do you want a hand, Electra?

ELECTRA	Good luck or bad luck, we need to take the bull by the horns and convince her. Oh, the bull...in my case.

REBECCA	Can I have a hug?.. In that case, it’s really serious.. What’s happening?

ELECTRA	It’s all the purple’s fault! Help meeee please!

REBECCA	Please...go, go....seriously! Don’t be superstitious!

ELECTRA	Fantastic! So you don’t believe it!

REBECCA	Not at all!

ELECTRA	It’s a done deal! Let’s swap the fabrics that Mancuso gave us! Purple doesn’t make you scared, does it? So look, I’ll give you loads!

REBECCA	Uh,...but I...really...

ELECTRA	So you see: you are superstitious as well!

REBECCA	No...no..give it to me! I’ll make a super luxurious dress from it...

ELECTRA	Great...bye!

REBECCA	But such a hurry... Oof!

REBECCA	Noooo don’t do... it

ELECTRA	(Laugh) You need to know how to save yourself...because success is also a matter of luck! So the way will be free and strai....ight
