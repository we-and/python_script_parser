THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...How being little doesn't mean you can't do big things. 

THOMAS	When Skiff heard there was a bad storm coming he wanted to do his part and make sure everyone was safe.

THOMAS	But Duck told him only big engines could help in the storm. 

THOMAS	Joe had anchored Skiff on the harbour front. But the wind was so strong it blew Skiff’s sail loose. Then his anchor rope snapped!

THOMAS	The wind pushed Skiff down the track and onto a fallen tree. Skiff was trapped!

THOMAS	Then there was more trouble! Skiff saw Duck and Oliver coming down the tracks. He needed to warn them about the tree or there would be a terrible accident!

THOMAS	Skiff didn't give up and managed to pull his sail free. Duck and Oliver saw him and stopped just in time. Skiff had saved them!

THOMAS	So remember, just because you're small doesn't mean you can't do big things.
