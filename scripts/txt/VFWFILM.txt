BOZ	Clear these hypers out of here.

WALTER	These are shitty cigarettes, you know that?

WALTER	You got shitty cigarettes.

WALTER	How come you don't got no organic 2100's or something?

FRED	I'll get right on it, Walter.

WALTER	Hm... hmm.

WALTER	All right, gentlemen, gather around the campfire,

WALTER	because it's story time.

WALTER	The year... 1969.

WALTER	We're overseas, and this is when Fred was,

WALTER	you know, not this, exactly.

WALTER	I got a weekend of R&R at some shitty fuel depot.

WALTER	And I'm drunk as a payday skunk and I see this guy comin', okay?

WALTER	And I hate the son of bitch,

WALTER	because he used to pitch for the Rockets,

WALTER	which was two towns over,

WALTER	and he beaned me in the skull with a fast ball senior year.

WALTER	Boom!

WALTER	I go down, okay?

WALTER	And then, and then...

WALTER	So I'm gonna take this guy apart.

WALTER	And then...

ABE	You know where you are, kid?

ABE	You're in the VFW post.

ABE	You want to check his ID, man?

ABE	Maybe his situation is still AWOL.

ABE	Come on, check it, check it, man.

ABE	Yeah, be sure.

FRED	All right, Abe.

FRED	Uh-huh.

FRED	What are you drinking?

SHAWN	Beer, please.

WALTER	You're leading the parade?

SHAWN	A-huh. No.

SHAWN	A buddy of mine told me,

SHAWN	you wear your uniform on the plane,

SHAWN	they'll bump you up to first class.

SHAWN	Didn't happen.

FRED	Hey, Walter, this will shut you up.

FRED	Man just got home.

WALTER	Yes! Yes sir!

DOUG	Don't think about reaching for your wallet.

DOUG	Nobody pays first day back.

DOUG	Fred, gentlemen's preference all around.

LOU	I'll contribute to the cause.

LOU	But not

ABE	Hey, sit down. Come on.

LOU	From that paint thinner shelf, up there.

WALTER	I was just getting to the good part, guys.

THOMAS	Yeah, you must have been taking a scenic route.

WALTER	Oh my... hey, new fella?

SHAWN	SHAWN.

WALTER	Shane?

SHAWN	SHAWN.

WALTER	Whatever.

WALTER	I don't even know you,

WALTER	but I know you're going to fuckin' love this.

WALTER	I knocked this motherfucker out, ice cold on the ground.

WALTER	And I'm looking down at him, and I go, "Oh shit."

WALTER	Because I just realized he is a fuckin' staff sergeant.

WALTER	He's got like seven ranks on me.

WALTER	I'm, I-I I'm 19 years old. I'm shittin' myself.

WALTER	Oh fuck, I am court marshaled. I am so dead.

WALTER	And what's the first words out of your mouth?

WALTER	Fred, remember what you said? First words.

FRED	I said ah, "Soldier, you like American poontangs?"

LOU	Yes.

WALTER	That's what, that's what he said.

WALTER	I thought I knocked some marbles loose.

WALTER	But no, he's got tickets in his pocket

WALTER	for that night's USO show

WALTER	where Miss 1963 is shaking her mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

LOU	Oh, it was glorious.

WALTER	It was.

WALTER	Freddy says he's taken so much high heat from the Vietcong

WALTER	that that little red, white, and blue right hook,

WALTER	that felt like home.

WALTER	He makes a couple of phone calls,

WALTER	and the first thing I know, I'm transferred into his unit.

WALTER	And me and Lou over here, and Fred,

WALTER	we finished out our tours.

WALTER	And we all come home together

WALTER	and we we fired around in town.

WALTER	We're painting houses and shit.

WALTER	And then one day, we say, "Fuck it."

WALTER	And then we take the first plane back into the shit, you know?

WALTER	But that was, but that was enough for me,

WALTER	but-but Fred, holy cripes, he's, he keeps going.

WALTER	He goes like five tours of duty, right?

FRED	That's enough, Walter, alright, alright.

WALTER	Because you should have seen this bastard over there.

WALTER	Alive, I fuckin' tell you.

FRED	Wow, wow, wow, hey!

FRED	Hey, hey, let it go, huh?

WALTER	I'm just getting to the big twist here, okay?

WALTER	Here comes the purple-nurple.

WALTER	Miss 1963, Fred, you ever wonder what happened to that girl?

WALTER	She got married. She had a couple of kids,

WALTER	and one of them followed in Mama's career path.

FRED	Hmm.

WALTER	And that is why I'm going to ask you

WALTER	the same delicately phrased question

WALTER	that you asked me all those years ago.

WALTER	Do you like American poontang?

FRED	Give me this.

WALTER	Because Miss 1963 had a kid

WALTER	that's name is Crystal now,

WALTER	and she's dancing on the pole tonight at midnight

WALTER	at the Déjà Vu over on Lincoln.

FRED	Ah, come

WALTER	And we're all going. We're all going.

WALTER	And you can't say no, 'cause this is a celebration.

WALTER	And we're not celebrating in this shithole.

FRED	Watering hole.

WALTER	The shitty watering hole.

WALTER	And you, my young friend,

WALTER	you are going to get a hero's homecomin',

WALTER	that's how, all right?

WALTER	I'm serious. So, get your shit together.

WALTER	We leave at 2300 hours, or whenever I finish urinating.

WALTER	Whichever comes first.

ABE	No, no, no, no, no.

LOU	Yeah.

ABE	No, no. No.

LOU	That's it.	

ABE	She got no pussy hairs.

FRED	Pardon?

ABE	I like pussy hairs.

ABE	What gives her the right to cut off her pussy hairs?

FRED	It's her pussy.

THOMAS	I don't understand how they get it so smooth.

THOMAS	Like a goddamn ice luge.

SHAWN	Lasers.

THOMAS	Laser of course, they're getting those lasers.

ABE	They're gettin' those...

DOUG	Eureka! Blasting cunt hairs in outer space.

DOUG	Pew, pew.

ABE	You don't get it, back in the day,

ABE	I used to buy toothpicks by the gross, just in case.

ABE	You know what I'm saying?

FRED	Whoa, whoa.

ABE	Now wait a minute?

FRED	Wow.

THOMAS	Am I having a stroke?

MAN 1	He says we need to move; we need to move.

MAN 1	Is everything else ready?

MAN 2	Yeah, everything else is ready to go. Giddy up.

FRED	Goddammit.

FRED	I'm afraid that's all she'll roll, boys.

FRED	Party's over, time to call it a day.

LOU	Fred, I've been telling you about this guy.

LOU	This guy, Eddy Harris,

LOU	he's the best electrician in town,

LOU	he can rewire this whole goddamn dump.

FRED	Uh-huh.

LOU	I mean, he'll have it humming.

FRED	Oh, yeah? Wouldn't it ?

LOU	He might even be able to serve beer when it's cold.

FRED	Lou, if he's anything like the plumber

FRED	you sent over last time, keep his number.

BOZ	Don't say a fucking word.

GUTTER	What did you do?

BOZ	Listen up.

BOZ	A filthy, filthy little reptile...

BOZ	You all know her as Lizard,

BOZ	has stolen your fix.

BOZ	Hype all you want.

BOZ	Enough to liquefy your fuckin' tonsils

BOZ	to whoever brings me the girl.

GUTTER	Lizard's sister? What purpose did that serve?

BOZ	She won't get away. The hypers will retrieve her.

GUTTER	Half of them can barely walk.

BOZ	Don't underestimate 'em, Gutter.

BOZ	You see, an army of brain-dead animals

BOZ	is still an army.

WALTER	Freddy, this'll cheer you up.

WALTER	She's still dancin' tonight.

FRED	Agh!

FRED	Hey Lou, it's gonna be all right.

FRED	The smaller force acts while the larger force regroups.

WALTER	Yeah.

WALTER	Fuck. Yeah, come on.

WALTER	Yeah.

LOU	Come on.

WALTER	Fred, Fred, listen, you and me both know,

WALTER	this ain't the only option.

WALTER	We could push Miss Teen USA right back out the front door

WALTER	the way she came in.

FRED	Is that the man you want to be, Walter?

WALTER	No.

WALTER	Christ, look, I got your six.

WALTER	Get to your truck,

WALTER	and get your ass to the police station, riki-tiki.

FRED	Hey, you said some little while ago,

WALTER	Oh, geez.

WALTER	Whoo! Oh, my god.

FRED	You got a piece?

SHAWN	I do.

WALTER	You're good with it.

SHAWN	They sent me to the ranger regiment, sir.

SHAWN	Some of the guys took to calling me 'Dead Eye'.

WALTER	That is a clever moniker.

FRED	Well, whoo, Dead Eye.

FRED	I'm glad you're in the mood for a beer tonight.

SHAWN	It makes one of us.

WALTER	Now what?

FRED	Now the girl talks.

LOU	Two hours, and nothing.

LOU	Don't you think the Police would have heard something?

WALTER	What, in this neighborhood?

WALTER	The gunshots are like crickets. It's like background noise.

WALTER	The cavalry ain't coming, Lou.

FRED	It's Q&A time, kid.

FRED	Sit.

FRED	What's your name?

LIZARD	Elizabeth, call me Lizard.

FRED	Well, my name is Fred.

FRED	Now see, the problem is that me and my old friends

FRED	are probably going to die tonight

FRED	unless you help us out

FRED	to understand what's happening here.

FRED	A couple of minutes ago, some woman tried to kill me

FRED	in the parking lot.

FRED	But what really pissed me off, is that bitch trashed my truck

FRED	and Lizard, I really, really love my truck.

FRED	Yeah. She also said to me, "Give it back."

FRED	What's that supposed to mean?

FRED	She didn't say, "Give her back," or "Give Lizard back."

FRED	No, no. She said, "Give it back."

FRED	So what is it?

FRED	Huh?

FRED	Hard case.

FRED	When she came in, anybody see,

FRED	was she carrying something with her?

SHAWN	Not that I saw.

ABE	No, I didn't see shit, man.

ABE	I was too busy focusing on this jerk

ABE	trying to cut off Doug's arm.

LOU	Why don't you quit this true grit bullshit?

LOU	You just throw her out the door.

LOU	I mean, maybe you got this merciful stuff still in you,

LOU	but I don't have it in my body anymore. Now you

LIZARD	Ah!

SHAWN	Hey, woah.

LOU	You speak, honey,

LOU	or I'm going to lace right into you hard.

FRED	You're not going to lace into anybody.

FRED	This is my joint, all right?

LOU	Neither are you, man.

LOU	Oh! Fuck! Shit.

FRED	All right. All right. It's nothin'.

FRED	All right? Sorry. Go on, clean yourself up.

FRED	Your own fault.

FRED	It's his own fault.

WALTER	Yeah.

BOZ	Give me some good news.

GUTTER	Eliminated one man. Couldn't get inside.

BOZ	Where's Roadie?

TANK	He's dead. Bartender shot him.

LOU	Ah!

LOU	Eugh!

LOU	Agh.

LOU	Yeah, that's when you used to be fun, Fred.

LOU	Shit.

LOU	Well...

LOU	Hey, Little Miss Bo Peep here,

LOU	she's been playing hide and seek with us.

FRED	What?

WALTER	Ho-ho-ho-oh. Geez, god.

FRED	Just how much is this?

WALTER	That is a whole fuckin' lot, that's what that is.

SHAWN	It's enough to kill the kid over.

FRED	Hey, did you steal this?

LIZARD	Boz killed my sister, all right?

LIZARD	This though, it's all he's got his whole fuckin' life.

LOU	Well, there it is. We just give this back,

LOU	and-and the nightmare ends.

LOU	And now we can go to the titty bar,

LOU	where we're supposed to be.

LIZARD	It doesn't work like that, all right?

LIZARD	That guy over there with the exploded fucking head,

LIZARD	that's Roadie.

LIZARD	Boz's little brother.

BOZ	V-F-W.

BOZ	What the fuck is that?

GUTTER	Veterans of foreign wars.

BOZ	Soldiers? Good.

BOZ	Soldiers are good at dying.

LIZARD	You guys murdered his little brother.

LIZARD	Now Boz won't stop until

FRED	Killed every one of us, right?

LIZARD	Yeah, and your kids and your grandkids

LIZARD	and your great grandkids.

LIZARD	Jesus Christ, how fuckin' old are you guys?

ABE	Screw you, bitch.

WALTER	Ah, pump the brakes on the old guy stuff, all right?

WALTER	And I don't know about this murder,

WALTER	could be manslaughter, he came in with a big damn axe.

FRED	Jesus Christ, Walter, what the hell is the difference?

LOU	Well, I feel like I'm in the twilight zone, okay?

LOU	Because this little girl here, this little child,

LOU	she is dictating to us what's gonna go down.

LOU	You know, maybe your sister, maybe that little junkie

LOU	deserved to fuckin' get it.

LIZARD	Shut your fuckin' mouth.

FRED	Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

FRED	Knock it off.

FRED	Hey! This is my post, my rules. You don't like it?

FRED	Then walk the hell out of here, huh?

LOU	Yeah, let's put her outside the front door.

FRED	Crying out loud, shut up, Lou.

FRED	Hey, here.

FRED	You were a soldier. You were a good soldier.

FRED	So were we all, weren't we?

FRED	So, let's act like it.

FRED	We set a perimeter.

FRED	We make our state.

WALTER	Remember the Alamo.

ABE	Yeah, but they all died at the Alamo.

WALTER	Yeah.

DOUG	Dumb shit.

FRED	All right, I got nine rounds for the 12-gauge.

FRED	Ranger?

SHAWN	I got three left in the .45.

WALTER	You got a big damn fire axe,

WALTER	and Doug can attest to the effect that this had had.

FRED	So, what do you think, kid?

LIZARD	It's not enough.

FRED	Better get to work.

FRED	Hey, how are you with this?

DOUG	No, I got this. I got this.

FRED	You sure?

DOUG	Tell him to give me a trigger finger.

WALTER	Eh.

LOU	Be good to me, Gordie.

WALTER	Whoo-hoo.

LOU	Ooh boy, right up his ass.

WALTER	Here we go.

WALTER	This little piggy went to work.

WALTER	I don't want to tell you where that's one going to go.

WALTER	Here we go. A little more, a little more. A little more.

LOU	Egh.

FRED	See, the trick is to get the snap and the flick

FRED	all in one very cool, very fluid motion.

FRED	I used to be good at it,

FRED	but my fingers are gettin' kind of stiff.

LIZARD	This place is kind of gross.

FRED	This place, our VFW post 2494.

LIZARD	What's that mean?

FRED	It means it's a home, at least for me, it is,

FRED	and for the rest of these bums.

FRED	See, when we got back from 'Nam, we just kind of gravitated.

FRED	Just, you know, washed up here like some kind of a tide.

FRED	There used to be more of us.

FRED	There used to be a lot more of us, but...

LIZARD	What was it like over there?

FRED	'Nam?

LIZARD	Yeah.

FRED	I remember the mud.

FRED	I remember crawlin' in the mud.

FRED	A lot of men dyin' in the mud.

FRED	I hated the fucking mud.

FRED	Now Abe, you know, he's, ow, he's the,

FRED	you know, he's the old sourpuss

FRED	with all the charm of a claw hammer.

FRED	He wasn't in 'Nam.

FRED	No, he's Korea. Different war, same shit.

LIZARD	Same mud?

FRED	Yeah.

FRED	Same mud, 'cept his was frozen.

FRED	Yeah, and old ranger Rick, you know, SHAWN?

FRED	He just got back from the desert.

FRED	No mud over there, just a whole shitload of sand.

FRED	Don't matter where you fought, you make it back.

FRED	You got a home, right here.

SHAWN	You ready?

ABE	Don't get killed by those antlers.

SHAWN	Don't poke your eyeballs out.

ABE	Yeah, no problem. No problem.

WALTER	All right. Don't kill 'em all at once now.

LOU	Fuck it. Now I'm not going to leave

LOU	any of them for you.

WALTER	I like the sound of that, Gordie.

WALTER	Hey here, I got something for you.

LOU	Ooh.

WALTER	You know, I think we're going to be fine,

WALTER	as long as they come at us on skates.

FRED	Well, imagine we're going to have some company

FRED	any time now, so why don't you get yourself behind the bar

FRED	and look out for Doug.

LIZARD	No, no, no. I can, I can help.

FRED	No doubt.

FRED	You'll be helping by looking after Doug.

FRED	And, if shit goes sideways

LIZARD	I'll kill 'em.

FRED	I knew you were a hard case.

FRED	Come on, motherfucker.

LOU	Ah, let them come. Here they come.

DOUG	I got to help.

LIZARD	Relax. Relax.

DOUG	They're my friends.

LIZARD	They're going to be all right.

LIZARD	You're good. Just relax.

FRED	Ah, shit. Ah, shit.

WALTER	Get the grenades.

LOU	Yeah, I got them.

WALTER	You gotta get it out.

DOUG	Light it for me?

LIZARD	No, it's not good for you.

DOUG	Oh come on, you're fuckin' kidding me, kid?

DOUG	It's medical.

DOUG	Are we winning?

LIZARD	Yeah.

LIZARD	Your friends are kickin' ass.

WALTER	Come on, Lou!

LOU	Jesus Christ!

WALTER	Sorry, Gordie.

FRE	Ah! [in rasping voice] A little help here.

LOU	Yeah. Fuckin' hippie.

ABE	Here, you dropped this.

SHAWN	Abe!

SHAWN	Oh whoa, I got you. I got you.

ABE	I got you? You're my fuckin' savior now?

FRED	Ah, shit. Phew!

LOU	Now I got blood and pickled pork shit on my jacket.

FRED	Well, you look good.

LOU	Thanks.

WALTER	Hey, you're gonna have to walk it off.

ABE	Yeah, yeah. Fuck you, man.

SHAWN	Have a seat right there.

FRED	Everybody in one piece?

WALTER	Well, let me check, yeah.

ABE	Ah, you motherfucker. Fuck you.

WALTER	Oh sh

SHAWN	Come on.

FRED	Ah, oh God.

SHAWN	Are you all right?

FRED	Hey, good jo

FRED	oh, good job.

FRED	I tell you, that son of a bitch stole my chest.

WALTER	Any more of these prehistoric creatures

WALTER	coming through that door?

FRED	Get those doors barricaded.

FRED	Let's use those bodies as sand barriers,

FRED	all right?

SHAWN	Yes, sir. Come on.

GUTTER	He's taking too long.

BOZ	Him and the men must have killed Tank.

BOZ	Fuck.

GUTTER	Sun's up soon.

GUTTER	If you don't get inside, it's over.

BOZ	Load up.

BOZ	Heavy stuff. Hard stuff.

BOZ	I'm tired of fuckin' playin' games.

FRED	Thanks for saving my life, Elizabeth.

LIZARD	I started this.

FRED	Let's finish it.

FRED	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

FRED	Hey, you. You only winged them.

FRED	Are you losing your touch?

DOUG	Don't-don't make, don't make me laugh,

DOUG	it hurts too much. [choking on blood]

DOUG	Oh! I think it's time to call this game. [coughs]

FRED	No way, Doug.

DOUG	One more for the road.

FRED	I give you one more, but it's not for the road,

FRED	it's for my birthday.

FRED	Remember, it's my birthday, huh?

DOUG	No, listen, I'm on my last.

DOUG	You got to listen to me now, sir, happy birthday.

FRED	Thanks, man.

FRED	You'll be alright.

ABE	Hey, kid.

ABE	You know what I said, uh, when you first came in?

SHAWN	Yeah.

ABE	Anyway, when you get to be my age,

ABE	people don't really give a shit what you say.

SHAWN	I'll just be ready

SHAWN	for the chance to get to your age, old man.

ABE	Right.

WALTER	Lou?

LOU	Yeah.

WALTER	You know that bag she brought in here full of shit?

LOU	Yeah.

WALTER	What if you had all of that in cash?

WALTER	Cash? Cold hard cash? What would you do with that?

LOU	You know what I'd do?

WALTER	Hmm.

LOU	With all those funds from that garbage?

WALTER	Yeah.

LOU	I'd buy each one of us a really nice casket.

LOU	Gold trim. Extra cushion. Tempur-Pedic foam.

WALTER	Ah-huh.

LOU	Yeah, the best money could buy

LOU	so that we'd all be cozy,

LOU	like two little bears in a glen after we die.

WALTER	You know what?

WALTER	Your foxhole chit chat needs work.

WALTER	Jesus. Fuck.

WALTER	Lou's sliding off the deep end.

WALTER	He's going to be section eight any minute now.

SHAWN	We gotta wall them?

FRED	No. No, no. That ain't the way.

FRED	Look those fuckers, they got to be hurting too.

FRED	I'm going to go out there.

FRED	I'm going to make a run for it.

SHAWN	Fred

FRED	I'm going to make a lot of noise.

SHAWN	I don't know.

FRED	I will draw them off

FRED	and you get Doug to my truck and you get him the hell

FRED	out of here, you understand me?

WALTER	Fred, you ain't going to

WALTER	make it two blocks without them being all over you.

FRED	Yeah, well, Walter, you tell me,

FRED	you got a better idea?

WALTER	Well, you can't run.

FRED	You got a better idea?

FRED	Dougie's dying on the bar,

FRED	you think I'm going let him just bleed out there?

FRED	That ain't going to happen.

LIZARD	Fred! Fred!

WALTER	Oh, shit.

FRED	Fuck sakes.

LIZARD	Fred!

LIZARD	You piece of shit. What the fuck

LIZARD	you think you're doing?

LOU	All right.

FRED	What's going on?

LOU	I can negotiate us out of this mess.

FRED	No.

LOU	I can.

LOU	I can do what you can't do.

LOU	Just-just have a little faith in me, okay?

FRED	Lou...

LOU	Just this once.

FRED	Lou, you... that bag is the only thing

FRED	that's keeping us alive, right?

FRED	You give that up, they'll torch this place like a matchbox.

FRED	Where the hell are you going, man?

LOU	I'll be back.

LOU	After all, we got a birthday to celebrate.

FRED	Lou! Lou, wait!

LIZARD	He's out of his fuckin' mind.

SHAWN	He's a used car salesman.

ABE	Yeah, he's got that goddamn pussy party on his brain.

LOU	And let's make a deal. Let's close a deal.

LOU	I mean, how can I get you in this car today, huh?

LOU	Sure.

LOU	Yeah, I'm-I'm not armed.

LOU	Take that conversation, man to man.

BOZ	So, what's your offer?

LOU	Easy exchange.

LOU	We'll give you back your, you know, your drugs.

LOU	You can go on your way and-and we'll go on ours.

BOZ	Intriguing.

BOZ	Ultimately unacceptable, but intriguing.

BOZ	There's only one satisfactory solution,

BOZ	and that is we get our product back

BOZ	and each of you die.

LOU	How-how about meeting me halfway?

LOU	I mean, negotiate with me. This is what I do.

LOU	You-you know Lou's Used?

LOU	Maybe you've seen some of my ads on TV?

LOU	There's a little blonde girl saying, "Want something,

LOU	you need something new? Call Lou."

LOU	I'm Lou.

LOU	That's me.

BOZ	I'm not familiar.

LOU	Mind if we talk honestly for a second?

LOU	Fred inside there is, he's kind of lost it.

LOU	I mean, he thinks he's still the platoon commander

LOU	back in the fuckin' jungles, you know?

BOZ	Ah... so he's in charge?

LOU	Well, not really.

LOU	I mean, yeah, he's kind of in charge there,

LOU	but I-I mean, I carry a lot of weight too, you know?

LOU	But I'm here talking to you.

LOU	I'm-I'm

BOZ	Shh, shh. Shh, shh.

BOZ	There's no negotiating.

BOZ	However, you may yet prove useful.

BOZ	Fred, your friend likes to talk.

BOZ	And you? Will you now talk?

BOZ	Send out the girl and the bag, and I send him back.

WALTER	Fred, what's up?

FRED	Give me the bag.

LIZARD	Don't give up now.

FRED	Look

LIZARD	Come on.

FRED	I'm sorry.

FRED	I don't know what to do.

FRED	We're done.

LIZARD	You had ways out.

LIZARD	You did.

LIZARD	But you chose to fight.

LIZARD	You asked for this fight.

LIZARD	And your friends, they followed you,

LIZARD	because they believed in you.

LIZARD	And now, now you're just a pussy.

FRED	Some mouth you got on you, you know that?

FRED	Did you get that from your dead sister too, huh?

LIZARD	You want to drink yourself to death,

LIZARD	go right a-fuckin'-head.

BOZS	All right, fire it up.

SHAWN	We move without him.

SHAWN	I don't like it any more than you do,

SHAWN	but getting home is the priority.

WALTER	We? Who put you in charge?

ABE	You don't have a better idea, Walter,

ABE	shut the fuck up.

LIZARD	Hey, assholes, you're not helping anything.

WALTER	Maybe you got an idea?

WALTER	'Cause we can sure as hell use a light bulb moment

WALTER	right about now, lady.

WALTEr	It's for you that we're doing all of this.

LIZARD	Hey, I never asked for your goddamn help, gramps.

WALTER	You didn't have to.

WALTER	That's the point.

WALTER	The second you walked through that door,

WALTER	we were duty-bound to help you.

BOZS	Quit fuckin' around, .

WALTER	Because you never get that

WALTER	through your thick fuckin' skull.

BOZS	Move, move, move.

WALTER	I should be in a titty bar right now.

WALTER	You know, great big silicon melons right in my fuckin' face.

LIZARD	Yeah, sorry to ruin your big fuckin' evening.

WALTER	Well, sorry don't feed the bulldog, boy.


SHAWN	Hey ladies, I hate to interrupt

SHAWN	your party plan assessment right now,

FRED	Ah, shut up, all of you!

FRED	Let's go.

ABE	Right now?

BOZ	Oh, is that you, Mr. Fred?

BOZ	Pleased to make your acquaintance.

BOZ	I know hindsight's 20/20, but

BOZ	you should have dealt, Fred.

BOZ	You know, inside that little hole,

BOZ	I can see just a small bit of you,

BOZ	but I know what's in there.

BOZ	You regretting every single decision you've made today.

FRED	You got it all wrong, son.

FRED	I don't regret a thing.

FRED	I lost my friends. Well, it's not right.

FRED	You took my friends,

FRED	but I guess they knew what they signed up for now.

FRED	I don't regret a goddamn thing.

FRED	Matter of fact, right about now, I'm feeling real eager.

FRED	So, whatever you're gonna do,

FRED	quit flapping your gums and do it.

FRED	But when you come, boy, you come sharp...

FRED	because you make a mistake...

FRED	I'mma cut your heart out.

SHAWN	Fred, that lamp's propane.

WALTER	We better hunker down, don't you think?

FRED	Yeah. Hey, Dead Eye, you know how to waltz?

SHAWN	Waltz?

FRED	Because I'm going to need you to follow my lead.

WALTER	He's back.

ABE	This ain't gonna be enough.

ABE	I got something for you.

BOZ	Hello, Fred.

BOZ	But perhaps now we can finally be civil.

FRED	You killed three of my friends.

FRED	That's not civil.

BOZ	No, that was just a misunderstanding.

BOZ	You're all, or were, soldiers, right?

BOZ	This whole place was built on murder.

FRED	No.

BOZ	Well, I suppose murder is subjective.

FRED	Not really.

BOZ	You enjoy it, don't you?

BOZ	The killing.

FRED	Well, I got to admit, I did get kind of a charge

FRED	outta blowing your brother's fuckin' head off.
