CAROLINA	With your agency on the line.

ARTHUR	No, with your job on the line. 

CAROLINA	Excalibur will be mine.

ARTHUR	I don’t think so.

RAFAEL	We got the Picture.

ARTHUR	Can I see it?

MAX	Genius!

ADELE	It’s beautiful.

MAX	I told you he was good, huh? I told you.

ADELE	It’s great.

ARTHUR	It’s perfect, we have the picture.

CAROLINA	Arthur did it. What do you think?

PIETRO		The thing is that I even like it, because she’s got natural beauty, isn’t it exactly what they wanted?

LILI	 This is what we’re looking for, a natural beauty. 

PIETRO	 Well, then I guess we all agree on that, don’t we, Carol?

CAROLINA	Of course.

LILI	Settled.

CAROLINA	The bet is already won, this girl won’t even pass on the first round, my dear.

ARTHUR	Only if you sabotage me.

CAROLINA	Ah.

ARTHUR		And you know very well that there’s a clause in the countract, that you give me the victory if you do this.
 
CAROLINA	Ah.

ARTHUR	(Reac)
 
CAROLINA	Oh, you are really hot.

ARTHUR	Is it just me or is smoke coming out of you?

CAROLINA	(groan)

ARTHUR	Hm?

CAROLINA	(reac – yell)

ARTHUR	Ah, fire!

CAROLINA	Fire! Fire!

ARTHUR	Come on, come on, get out

CAROLINA	Ah.

ARTHUR	Come here.

CAROLINA	Fire, it’s on fire...

ARTHUR	(reac) Get out of there, get out

CAROLINA	Water.

ARTHUR	Get out. Where is there water?

CAROLINA	In the bathroom, Arthur.

ARTHUR	Here.
	
CAROLINA	For the love of God, ah (reac)

ARTHUR	Get out, get out!

CAROLINA	Come, let’s go, Arthur. 

ARTHUR	Getting water here. 

CAROLINA	Arthur, hurry up.

ARTHUR	Hold on, hold on.

CAROLINA	(reac) But you...

ARTHUR	Get out, get out!

CAROLINA	Go, ah, get it, water

ARTHUR	(Reac)

CAROLINA	I can’t believe this is happening. What is this? (reac)

ARTHUR	Come here, let’s take this mattress out of here.

CAROLINA	No, no, no, no, don’t touch the mattress

ARTHUR	Let’s go?

CAROLINA	(reac)

ARTHUR	Let’s go?

CAROLINA	Later I, I’ll ask the doorman to help me, leave it.

ARTHUR		No, there could be an ember in here, the fire could start again, come on, let’s go.

CAROLINA	No.

ARTHUR	Let’s go.

CAROLINA		Arthur, leave it, leave it like this. It’s not necessary (Reac)

ARTHUR	What is this?

CAROLINA	What? I don’t know.

ARTHUR	Some candles here, they look like...melted candy.

CAROLINA		candy? (reac) My, my nephews, my nephews were here in the afternoon, those pests must have been here with Dorinha. It coul donly have been them. Let me see (reac)

ARTHUR	These candles have been lit since when?

CAROLINA	This is a citronella candle, they stay lit all day.

ARTHUR	We have to talk to Dorinha, right?

CAROLINA	(reac)

ARTHUR	This joke has gone too far.

CAROLINA	(reac)

ARTHUR	Hasn’t it?

CAROLINA	Absolutely.

ARTHUR	Yeah

CAROLINA		It’s absolutely gone too far. You cal leave me here with Dorinha I’ll deal with it. Ah, my nephews, unbelievable, are you seeing this?

ARTHUR	It’s ok, calm down, it’s over.

CAROLINA	Why are they so unbarable?

ARTHUR	It’s over.

CAROLINA	(reac)

CAROLINA	Come.

ARTHUR		Are you sure you don’t want to go to my house? This way we can...

CAROLINA	I’m sure.

ARTHUR	...we can pick up where we left off....

CAROLINA	(reac)

ARTHUR	Hm?

CAROLINA	I’m not in the mood, Arthur.

ARTHUR	(Reac)

CAROLINA		I’m shaken, I’m ashamed. This joke, this prank has been a literal bath of cold water for me, I can’t, I’m sorry.

ARTHUR		No, but in any way you won’t be able to sleep here, right?

CAROLINA		Of course I will, I’ll sleep in the other room, I take care of myself. Go, goodnight.

ARTHUR	Okay then. (kiss) Good night.

CAROLINA	Goodnight Arthur, go, go, go, go, go

ARTHUR	Ah, okay.

CAROLINA	(Raec)

ARTHUR	(reac) Goodnight Carolina, and what a night, huh?

CAROLINA		Ah, Dorinha, what an embarrasment you’ve put on me. 

DORINHA		Huh? The bed caught on fire while....I don’t believe it Carolina! (laugh) I even got nervous here, hold up, no, because an image like this we only see in rated R movies, right? (laugh) I can’t believe it, Carol.

MARIA	Bye mom.

JOÃO	Bye mom.

DORINHA		Hold on, just a minute, Carolina. Hey, hey, hey, what joke is this, going to school with these clothes, Maria? Go back and change.

JOÃO	I told you, dude, you’re ridiculous.

MARIA	Hey, kid, you’re the ridiculous one.

JOÃO	(reac)

MARIA		I’m completely powerful, just like those girls from the cover of the magazine from Aunt Carol.

JOÃO	In your dreams

MARIA	(kiss) Jerk

DORINHA		Guys, why do kids like to dress up like adults so much, huh? Maria, go and change your clothing right now, because Vam is waiting for you downstairs, you’re going to be late for school.

MARIA	Ah, ok.

DORINHA	Ah, Hi, Carolina.

MARIA	(grumbles)

DORINHA		Ah ok, now you’re going to complain, complain, complain. That’s the price I pay for helping you, no? You’re going to want me to pay the burned mattress also?

CAROLINA		My spring mattress, very expensive, my sheets, Egyptian cotton sheets, fifteen hundred thread count, do you know what that is?

DORINHA		Okay, Carolina, go ahead and rub it all in, understand? Scrub it in, because you know what? I don’t have sheets of eighthundred ninety (stutters) millions thread counts (reac)

CAROLINA		Listen up, don’t provoke me, woman. I had to send Arthur home, being filled with embarrasement. What if Arthur discovers what those candles are for, huh?

DORINHA		Ah no, but if you guys already, ahhh...Maybe it was even the candles that gave you a little help, hey? Who knows if it was with this fire that I’ve become an auntie, hah?


ZÉ PEDRO	So it’s today that you’re presenting the project, isn’t it?

FABINHO	It is.

ZÉ PEDRO	Nervous, Fabinho?

FABINHO	Very. (reac) My companie’s family is the one that’s polluting the Tamandua River. It’s been many years that I’ve wanted to do something about it, so, you can only imagine.

ZÉ PEDRO	It’s a noble gesture, isn’t it? But impressing your father is important for you also, isn’t it?

GERMANO	Good morning, Ze Pedro.

ZÉ PEDRO	Good morning

GERMANO	Good morning miss Mires, Hey..

MIRTES	Good morning.

GERMANO	What miracle is this, you here so early? I left the house, I thought you were still sleeping.

FABINHO	Once again you were fooled.

GERMANO	You could have carpooled with me. This here in your hands, is that the project?

FABINHO	It is.

GERMANO	You could have given it to me, too, I could have read it in the car, on the way.

FABINHO	I’m not here as your son, and I prefer that you read this with attention and not stopped in traffic. Is that ok?

GERMANO	I hope it doesn’t waste my time.

MAX		Candles, candy under the bed...Here, I threw it on the web, it came up with the recepie, here, look.

ARTHUR		Let me see, let me see, let me see. Carol is doing voodoo to get pregnant, really, she must be desperate, right?

MAX		There are people that believe in this, don’t assume the faith of others, ok? And this isn’t voodoo, this is sympathy to get pregnant.

ARTHUR	Get pregnant or have a barbeque?

MAX		My dear, it’s not my specialy, but that woman is not a toy, she wants your agency and she wants to have a son of yours, and the way things are going, she’s going to get both of those.

ARTHUR		She’s not going to get one thing or another, trust me, Max.

MAX	Ah, when I look at your blue eyes....

ARTHUR	(reac)

MAX		So calm, I feel the trust, but when I remember Carol, love, a traitor, I shiver! Prudence, condoms, and chicken soup don’t do anyone harm, ok?

FABINHO	Did you ask for me, dad?

GERMANO		Come in, sit down. You surprised me, the project is well supported, I can see that you took it seriously, I didn’t see any holes, not even in the budget.

FABINHO	I had help from my friends, so...

GERMANO		But I admit to you that I was inclined to not accept this proposal.

FABINHO	Why?

GERMANO		Because the cost is too high, you know? But reading this, I came up with the brilliant idea of transforming this enviromental project into a social project, too, using the people that live around the Tamandua River, the low income people, to participate as well, this would be sensational, this is marvelous, this would add a lot of value to our brand, this proves that Bastille, it cares about nature and the enviroment, and it also has social responsiblity.

FABINHO	I’m glad you liked it, but this idea wasn’t mine.

GERMANO	Don’t be modest.

FABINHO	No, I’m serious, it was Jonatas’,

GERMANO	Who?

FABINHO		Jonatas, that friend of mine that went to the house the other day.

GERMANO	The one that looks like a beggar?

FABINHO		Yes, I knew that you’d think that. That beggar went to the house to ask for a job and he presented this idea.

GERMANO		Impressive! Well then, the project is approved, and you can put it into action on Monday, got it?

FABINHO	Got it.

GERMANO		Congratulations, you’re now the new director of special projects for Bastille.

ELIZA	What’s all this noise, Jonatas?

JONATAS		I’m fixing up a few chairs here. I don’t know, I want to change up our house a bit. I’m thinking of making a living room, put these two together and you make a sofa (laugh)

ELIZA		Hm. I want to call my mom, I miss her, is there a way you can stop?

JONATAS		Redhead, learn one thing. You don’t ask for anything, you just tell me.

ELIZA	Hello, hi mom, can you talk?

GILDA		Yes, I can sweetie, Dino is in the office. What number is this? Do you have a new cell phone? Tell me, how are things? Is everything good with you? And at Doctor Jivago, that’s the name of your boss, isn’t it?

ELIZA (off)	I have some good news to share with you.

ELIZA	It’s not all figured out yet, but I think I got a job that’s going to offer me more money, and then I’m going to be able to bring you and my brothers here faster.

GILDA		Ah, sweetie, sweetie, I’m so happy for you, my love, but what am I going to do over in Rio de Janeiro, Eliza? Tell me, I, I can’t, I,

DINO	Are you saying that you’re in Rio de Janeiro...

DINO (off)	You mischevious girl?

ELIZA	(Reac)

DINO		Tell me where you are, you disgrace, so I can tell the delegate Pecanha to go get you.

GILDA	Give me that phone, Dino.

DINO (off)	Shut up woman, shut up!

GILDA (off)	Ah!

ELIZA		Send him, send the police after me, send them, I’ll tell them everything you did to me. I’ll tell them that you grabbed me, that I was only defending myself, you piece of trash.

DINO	Liar!

GILDA	(read)

DINO	I never touched a hair on you

GILDA	Dino.


ELIZA	Because I didn’t let you.

DINO		You robbed the register and tried to kill me, that’s what the police over here knows and they’re going to get you!

ELIZA		Oh, bastard. My mom knows what happened, try to send the police after me and see what happens when she tells the truth (reac). You’ve been after me ever since I stopped being a child, Dino.

GILDA	Give me that, Dino, give it...

DINO		Ah, okay, full of morals now, right? OK, you think so highly of yourself, right? So come back, try coming back to Campo Claro and let’s see who’ll be imprisoned.

ELIZA		I’m never coming back, ok? I’m going to get a lot of money and I’m going to find a way to bring my mom and my brother here.

ELIZA (off)	I’m going to get a decent place...

ELIZA		For my family to live in, just us four, far from you, you bastard! You’re going to die alone, Dino.

DINO		The one that’s going to suffer is you, you disgrace.

GILDA	That’s enough!

DINO	(reac)

GILDA	That’s enough, Dino.

DINO	Do you know what she said to me, Gilda?

GILDA	That’s enough.

DINO		Do you know what she said? She said she’d turn me into the police and you’re going to be by her side. Is that what you told her, Gilda?

GILDA		No, no, I told her that I’d stand by my husband, the father of my children, and I’m here! But listen closely to what I’m going to tell you Dino, if you leave out that door and go after Eliza, you’ll go out one door and I’ll go out the other, and I’ll take my kdis with me!

DINO	Have you gone crazy, woman?

GILDA		(reac) Ah! You’re my man, Dino, and I want to preserve our family, but this obsession of yours over Eliza is going to end up ruining everything that we’ve acheived! Forget her and look at the woman that’s here by your side, that’s always been here. (reac)

DINO		Ok, woman, forget Eliza, that’ll stay in Rio de Janeiro, that’ll lose herself in that giant city and that’ll never show up here, huh?

GILDA	(cry)

DINO	Well, I’m going to work as that’s what I do best.

GILDA	(cry)


ELIZA		Disgraceful! (cry) I hope, I hope that Arthur is telling the truth, Jonatas. It’s my only chance. It doesn’t help, it doesn’t help thinking that my life is going to get better selling flower (reac) I need real money. Handouts aren’t going to bring my family back here, no. (reac – cry)

FABINHO	Leila, he approved it!

LEILA	What?

FABINHO	We got it.

LEILA	What did we get?

FABINHO	My dad approved the project!

LEILA	You’re going to depolutte the river?

FABINHO	I’m serious.

LEILA	I can’t believe it

FABINHO	I’m so happy that (kiss – laugh)

LEILA	I knew you were going to get it.

FABINHO	Me, no, us, right?

LEILA	Us.

FABINHO		And if it wasn’t for that idea of Jonatas’, wow, ah, I owe him so much.

LEILA	So much.

FABINHO	Hey Jamaica.

LEILA	Whoa!

FABINHO	Come over here, crazy

JAMAICA	What’s up?

FABINHO		My dad approved the project, brother, he’s going to finance it

JAMAICA	Whoa dude!

FABINHO	It’s going to be depolutted.

JAMAICA	Victory! (laugh)

LEILA	We’re going to depolutte the river, Jamaica.

JAMAICA	We have to celebrate, we have to celebrate...

FABINHO	I’m already celebrating (laugh)

JAMAICA	Hum (laugh)

FABINHO	(laugh)

JAMAICA	Ah (laugh)

FABINHO	Oh, no...

MARCÃO		Look at this, the revolutionaries. Have you already overtaken the system from the inside? 

FABINHO	Actually we have, buddy

MARCÃO		How, working with your daddy? He already gave you the car of the year?

FABINHO		(laugh) Listen up, you fool, before you see it in the papers, I’m going to tell you that for me it doesn’t matter if it was an infultration, a demonstration.... what matters is that Tamandua River is going to be depolutted, my friend. And this...

LEILA	(laugh)

FABINHO	...is a great victory. 

MARCÃO		To me you’ve sold your soul to the devil. Stay awake, ok? The devil gives us what we want, but it costs us greatly.

LEILA	Hm, what a cookie cutter phrase, huh, Marcão?

FABINHO	He’s stuck, he’s listening to nonsense.

LEILA	You’ve been better before at this.

FABINHO	(laugh)

MARCÃO	You’ve also been much better.

LEILA	The devil himself...

JAMAICA		Hello, hey. Hey, hey. What’s this guys? Let’s forget this bottom feeder yeah?

FABINHO	This...

LEILA	Leave him.

JAMAICA	Speaking of the devil, let’s celebrate

FABINHO	Let’s go!

JAMAICA	...because we deserve it.

FABINHO	We deserve it, let’s go, huh!

JONATAS		Have you dried your tears? Already changed your clothes? So then, let’s inagurate our new sofa! (laugh) Come, madam.

ELIZA		Ah, madam is your mother. Well, not your mom, because I like Mrs Rosangela. So, not madam ok... Ah, I don’t know, you understood, right?

JONATAS	(laugh) If you’re playing it’s because you’re better.

ELIZA		(laugh) Clown. Only you can make me smile today. (reac)

JONATAS	May I sit next to you, madam?

ELIZA	Hey!

JONATAS	(laugh)

ELIZA	You’re asking for it, aren’t you?

JONATAS	Move over then, go.

ELIZA	Hum, madam.

JONATAS	(laugh)

ELIZA	I can’t believe this, (reac) the dress tore.

JONATAS	It’s okay, I’ll fix it.

ELIZA	How are you going to fix this hole here, Jonatas? It’s going to look horrible. Ah, I can’t believe it, this stupid sofa, that’s not even a sofa, right?

JONATAS		Hey, hey, my bad, I must have left a loose nail around here, that’s it.

ELIZA		Oh, my God, and what if they don’t let me in the party? Even worse, if they expel me from the contest.

JONATAS		Calm down, that playboy must have a dozen more dresses to give you.

ELIZA	And If he doesn’t, Jonatas? I can’t lose this chance.

JONATAS		You’re not going to lose anything, you’re going to get real money, and then you won’t need handouts, unlike me, and you’re going to be able to bring your family here to live you four by yourselves. Isn’t that what you said?

ELIZA	Yes, that’s what I said, but that’s not what I meant. 

JONATAS		I think you were very clear, I’m not part of your dream.

ELIZA	Of course you are, Jonatas. You’re my only friend. 

JONATAS	(reac) Friend?

ELIZA		Yes, friend. And on Friday, at the party, when they announce me at the contest, it’s you that I want by my side.

JONATAS		If this story is really true, but I’ve already noticed that for you it is, right?

ELIZA		I’m sorry if I hurt you, ok? I’m serious, I didn’t mean to, without you I wouldn’t even be here today. I owe you everything and I’ll never forget it.

JONATAS	You don’t owe me anything.

ELIZA		(read) Stop, I already asked forgiveness. Stop with this, stop being sad. Wherever I go you’ll also go, deal? Friday we’re going to disvoer together what’ll become of my life. Of our life.

JONATAS	I’m wondering if I even want Friday to come.

CASSANDRA		Ah! (yelling) I can’t even believe that today is Friday. Wow, this week was slow, who knows, seven days.

DEBORA	I can’t believe that she’s not making a joke. 

HUGO		Stop being so impotent, sweetie, look how happy she is.

CASSANDRA	(laugh)

HUGO	When she’s like this the entire house is happier.

DEBORA	(ironic laugh)

CASSANDRA	Oh, hold on, hold on. (yell)

KATIA E LURDINHA	(reac- celebration)

CASSANDRA	(laugh)

KATIA	We’re going to make you even more beautiful (kiss)

CASSANDRA	Ah, you won’t be able to, you know?

LURDINHA		Did you already choose your costume? You have to attract attention, right?

CASSANDRA	I always do this, right my dear?

DEBORA	Even if it’s not always in the best way.

CASSANDRA		Did you hear that? Did you? Oh, that was the toilet flushing.

KATIA	(laugh)

CASSANDRA		Guys, where’s Adele? My stylist, where is she? For the love of God, my stylist, Adel. Hi dear, where are you? At the agency? What do you mean, Adele? I can’t believ eit, I can’t believe it, you’re going to stay there to take care of the, the beggar? Adele, I’m shocked!

ADELE		In the first place, she’s not a beggar, she’s a florist. And secondly, Arthur is the one that pays my bills, and she didn’t give me permission. My dear, we’ll meet at the press conference, ok? She just arrived, I have to hang up.

CASSANDRA		She hung up on me! Oh no (negative reaction) mark my words, everyone is here as a witness, the day I win this contest, I’m going to fire this girl.

HUGO		What’s up with this, sweetie? Adele is your childhood best friend.

DEBORA		Stop being ungrateful, she’s the one that got you in the contest.

CASSANDRA		Ok, fire may have been a bit strong, but the day that she gets a salary, I’m deducting this day from it.

LURDINHA		My dear, don’t get so tense, or else your skin is going to be terrible

KATIA		Exactly, listen up, focus on us, let us do our magic on you, understood? You’re going to shine, baby.

ARTHUR	Finally, my florist is here.

ELIZA	Well, I thought I wa your model.

ARTHUR		Yeah, yeah, from florist to model, we’re going to use that in the press today.

ELIZA	Hm.

ARTHUR		Journalists love those who come from the bottom. Write that down, Max, so that we don’t forget it.

MAX	Written clearly.

ELIZA		Arthur, just one problem, I accidentally ripped the dress that you gave me and I don’t think it’s mendable.

ARTHUR		No, there’s no problem, don’t worry about that, there’s plenty of other options here.

ELIZA	(reac)

ARTHUR	Pode jogar aquele no lixo. 
	You can throw that one in the trash.

ELIZA	(laugh)

JONATAS	Told you.

ELIZA	(reac) Ah.

ARTHUR	Well, to start, how about a nice shower?

ELIZA	Arthur, I already took a shower.

MAX	When? Where, in the  public fountain?

ELIZA	No, at your mother’s house, annoying.	

MAX		If it was at my mom’s house, you’d be scented and clean.

ELIZA		Look, you scented and clean, if you provoke me one more time, I’m going to leave, ok?

ARTHUR		Hey Max, stay quiet. Please forgive me, forgive me. He really talks too much.

ELIZA	Yes.

ARTHUR		I just said a shower for you to get to relax, we’re going to have a busy day, a strong, hot shower.

ELIZA	Hm.

JONATAS	Take advantage of it, go, take antoher.

ADELE	Let’s go, Eliza.

ARTHUR	Come on, come on.

ADELE	Let’s get beautiful for the conference, come.

ARTHUR	Go.

ADELE	Come girl, Come on girl.

ARTHUR	(reac)

ADELE	You’ve got to impress today, ok? Get marvelous.

JONATAS	So, can I use the shower after?

ARTHUR		Since I’m going to have to take you along, at least you’ll go clean, right?

JONATAS	What did you say, playboy?

ARTHUR	Did I say clean?

JONATAS	You did.

ARTHUR		No, I meant to say elegant. By the way, you have to see the wonderful suit that Max got you. You’re going to love it. Max, he’s all yours.

JONATAS		Hold on, hold on, hold on, he’s going take care of me?

MAX	I’m going to take care of him?

JONATAS		There’s no need, I know how to dress myself. Hand me that suit, come on. Where do I go?

MAX	Over there.

JONATAS	Over there.

CASSANDRA	Meow! Look at how sexy I look, amazing, ah.

KTIA E LURDINHA	(laugh)

KATIA	Meow? You got it, sexy.

LURDINHA	(applause)

KATIA	High five, our masterpiece.

LURDINHA	Success!

KATIA	(reac)

LURDINHA E KATIA	(laugh)

HUGO	Sweetie, isn’t this skirt too short?

CASSANDRA		Oh daddy, don’t start ok? Less is more, that’s my motto.

DEBORA		Hey, forget that mirror and look at how great our dad looks.

HUGO	(laugh)

CASSANDRA		Oooo, I hadn’t seen you yet, Prince of the Fatima Neighborhood. This suit is new, isnt’ it?

HUGO	Ah, it’s rented.

DEBORA	(laugh)

HUGO	This time I’m not going dressed poorly.	

DEBORA	No.

CASSANDRA	Ah, you’re looking to impress Carol...

DEBORA	Yeah! (reac)

CASSANDRA	Aren’t you? (laugh(

DEBORA	(laugh)

CASSANDRA		Did I tell you already? This one, ladies, got Carolina Castilho, from Total Dreamer.

DEBORA	Hm.

HUGO	(reac)

KATIA	Yes, you told us.

LURDINHA	Elegant like this, I’d also go after him.

HUGO	Huh?

CASSANDRA	What did you say?

LURDINHA		Oh (laugh). I’ve said too much, right? Forget it. (laugh)

DEBORA	Hm.

CASSANDRA	Guys

LURDINHA	(laugh)

CASSANDRA		...Guys, focus. Focus here, focus on me, ok? In this case my father is the supporting actor, and I’m the main star.

KATIA	Come on, let’s finish this hair.

CASSANDRA	Make it shine.

KATIA	It’s beautiful.

LURDINHA	It’s amazing.

CASSANDRA	I can’t go unnoticed, for God’s sake.

KATIA	Right!

ARTHUR		Uhum. Hold on a second I’ll call you right back, ok? Now you’re really looking like an Excalibur model.

ELIZA		Ah, but this thing here is squeezing me. Adele, my underwear is going up my butt.

ADELE	That’s part of it.

ELIZA		These shoes I have to take off because I don’t know how to walk with this. I know I’ll fall and mess everything up.

ARTHUR	Silence is a fantasy, isn’t it?

ELIZA	Where is Jonatas, huh?

MAX		He wanted to get dressed by himself. Guys, what creature is this?

ARTHUR	Hey Max, are you sure you chose the right size?

MAX		You’re the one that passed me the measurements. You did this on purpose, didn’t you, demon?

ADELE		No, I’m sorry, but the one that looks like a demon is you. (laugh)

MAX	(laugh)

ADELE	Ah, sorry.

MAX E ADELE	(talking)

JONATAS	Are you enjoying yourselves?

MAX	Oh, very. (laugh)

JONATAS	That’s great, that’s great.

MAX	You’re marevelous.

JONATAS	(ironic laugh)

MAX E ADELE	(talking)

ELIZA	It’s just that you look like a scarecrow.

MAX E ADELE	(talking)
	
JONATAS	What’s going on Eliza, even you?

ELIZA	Oh, it was my bad, it’s just that it’s funny, isn’t it?

MAX	Look, boys.

JONATAS	You know what?

MAX	(laugh) Yeah, it looks very good.

JONATAS		Take these clothes and shove it. I’m not going to any party anymore either.

JONATAS	You can keep this crap.

ARTHUR	What a shame.

MAX	Hey, you forget to take off the pants.

JONATAS		Hey, I didn’t forget, no, I didn’t forget it, I’m going to go get my own, and then I’ll return yours, that are ridiculous.

ELIZA	Jonatas (reac) if you don’t go, I also won’t go.

ARTHUR		You have to go, today is the presentation of the participants of the contest, it’s part of the job.

ELIZA		I know, I just want my friend by my side. Hey, where I go you’ll also go, remember?

MAX	Did you guys arrange this? Just for me to know.

ELIZA	We did, so what? Go, please.

JONATAS		Okay, Okay, I’ll go. But I’m going in my clothes and not in a scarecrow’s costume.

ARTHUR	Ah, fine by me.

MAX		And if they stop him at the door? The invite said formal attire.

ARTHUR	His bad luck, I did my part. (reac)

GERMANO	Lili. You were right, Fabinho did it.

LILI	Ah, (laugh – reac) I always believed in my son.

GERMANO		Well, I didn’t. But in a way I think this served as a push, isn’t it? For our son to grow.

LILI	Ah, Germano, how great it is to hear you say this.

AMBOS	(laugh)

GERMANO	(laugh)

LILI	Ah.

GERMANO	What?

LILI	Our son.

GERMANO	Hm.
	
LILI	(reac)
	
GERMANO	It’s great

LILI	(laugh)

GERMANO		Now that our son is moving forward, what do you think about us doing more about our marriage now?

CAROLINA	Pietro

PIETRO	Hi, love.

CAROLINA	The decor is beautiful.

PIETRO	(reac – kiss)

CAROLINA	As always. And this lighting turned out wonderful.

PIETRO	(laugh)

CAROLINA	This buffet is divine, I love it.
	
PIETRO	It is.

CAROLINA	Very good.

PIETRO		I’m going to receive this as a thank you for my dedication and competence. (kiss)

CAROLINA	Of course.

PIETRO	(laugh)

CAROLINA		Where is that messy assistant of mine? And the damn photographer, that was supposed to already be here taking pictures of things, where are they?

PIETRO		Well, Maria Luiza went to get Rafael with his car, they should be arriving.

CAROLINA		Ah, and since when is my assistant the personal driver of the photographer, Pietro?

PIETRO		Well yes, I didn’t understand that either, but, in the end I only scheduled them at seven thirty, love.

CAROLINA	(reac)

PIETRO		You’re the one that arrived early. You’re nervous, aren’t you?

CAROLINA		(reac) Extremely nervous. Nothing can go wrong today, Pietro. The press will be heavy here.

PIETRO	Relax, don’t worry.

CAROLINA	(reac)

PIETRO	(laugh)

CAROLINA	I am calm.

CHARLES	Anything else, Rafa?

RAFAEL		Huh? I don’t think so. Charles, let’s go because Lu must be arriving, ok?

CHARLES	Let’s go. Oh, Lu? The Lu from the nightclub?

RAFAEL	Uhum.
	
CHARLES	Wow, you are getting it, arent’y you, Rafa?	

RAFAEL	No, no, of course not.

CHARLES	No?

RAFAEL		No, the other day, for example, she came here, we didn’t even sleep together. 

CHARLES	Ah. 
	Ah.

RAFAEL	I think we entered into the friendzone.

CHARLES	Are you sure, dude?

RAFAEL		I’m telling you, man, I can’t give her what she wnts, I think that, I don’t know, she must have settled with this. And it’s better like this, right, because we work together, besides, we’re not short on women.

CHARLES	Oh, at the model’s party then...

RAFAEL	Hm? But only after work, right?

CHARLES	Uhum.

RAFAEL	Now let’s get going.
	
CHARLES	Let’s go.

RAFAEL		Let’s go because Lu must be downstairs and I don’t want to show up late.

CHARLES	No.
	
RAFAEL	I want to start off on the right foot.

CHARLES	Let’s go.

RAFAEL	I got it, excitement.

CHARLES	Ah.

LU	Hey.

RAFAEL	Hey, Lu.

LU	Hey, what’s up guys?

RAFAEL	What’s up?

LU	Everything ready?

RAFAEL	Ready. Let’s go.

CHARLES	Everthing’s ready.

LU	I parked downstairs, let’s go?

CHARLES	Of course.

LU	I just want a cup of water.

CHARLES		Of course, give me your car keys and I’ll start putting things the equipment in the trunk, ok?

LU	That’s fine.

CHARLES	Sounds good, dude.

RAFAEL	Thank you, Charles

CHARLES	It’s nothing.

RAFAEL	Water, right?

LU	Uhum.

RAFAEL		Lu, listen, thank you so much for picking us up here, ok?

LU		Don’t mention it. Um, I brought you chocolate, to celebrate our first job together and, I don’t know, to brighten up your night.

RAFAEL	Actually I’m diabetic (reac)

LU	Oh, I’m sorry. How embarrasing (reac)

RAFAEL		I’m just kidding, here, give me a piece. I’m not diabetic at all. (laughing)

LU	Liar.

RAFAEL	A game.

LU	(laugh)

RAFAEL	(laugh)

LU	How ridiculous!

RAFAEL	Not at all. Give me a piece

LU	(laugh)

RAFAEL	(risos)
	(laugh)

LU	Hold on, stop.

RAFAEL	Relax, do you want a piece of chocolate?

LU	I can’t.

RAFAEL	You really don’t want it?

LU	No!

RAFAEL	Okay then.

LU	I’m on a diet. (reac) I’m not joking.

RAFAEL		(reac) Lu, I have to ask you something, do you think that the Bastille owners will be there today?

LU		Of course, they’re the sponsers, aren’t they? Is that a problem?

RAFAEL		No, no. No, I just meant, I hope it’s not, because I haven’t seen them since the funeral.

LU	Oh. Do you regret getting this job?

RAFAEL		No, no, no, of course not. Ah, everything is going to go well, I have to get into this market, right? And this job was the best opportunity I’ve had since I arrived in Brazil, everything’s going to be alright thanks to you. Thank you, Lu.

LU	(laugh)


CASSANDRA		Hi, how are you? Everything’s great. Look, dad, didn’t I tell you that it’s best for us to arrive early? Carolina Castilho alone!

HUGO	My God, it’s her. Let’s go talk to Carolina.

CASSANDRA		Let’s go, come, come. Hi, Hi, how are you? Everything’s great.

HUGO	Carol.

CAROLINA	Oh no. Pietro.

CASSANDRA		Carolina, hi. (laugh) Remember me? My dad, your first boyfriend?

CAROLINA	(Reac)

CASSANDRA		Wow, I was so happy when I was selected for your contest.

CAROLINA	I knew I remembered you from somwhere.

CASSANDRA	(laugh)

CAROLINA	But wasn’t your hair a different color?

CASSANDRA		It was, well, I’ve already been a brunette, redhead, blonde, everything but Japanese, right?

CAROLINA	(laugh)

CASSANDRA	Now I’m like this, more natural. It’s, natural beauty.

CAROLINA	(laugh)

HUGO	You’re more beautiful than ever, Carolina.

CAROLINA		Ah, thank you. Well, please, make yourselves comfortable, I have to go solve some problems, excuse me.

HUGO		No, no, no, stay. I’m so much more comfortable when you’re around.

CASSANDRA	Comfortable or cozy, daddy?

HUGO	What was that, sweetie? (reac)

CASSANDRA	Sorry.

CAROLINA		Hey, hey Pietro, I have to take care of the press kits, I’ll, I’ll be right back.

PIETRO	Of course

CAROLINA	(stutters)

PIETRO	Of course.

CAROLINA	Excuse me.

HUGO	Carol.

CASSANDRA	(laugh)

HUGO	(reac)

CAROLINA	Yeah...

CASSANDRA	(laugh)

PIETRO		Yeah, oh Lord, what did they do with your face, my dear?

CASSANDRA		Ah, my friends did my makeup, and this volume here is to give me the kind of Gisele look. 

PIETRO		Got it. Quick to the dressing room to take this all off.

CASSANDRA	Ah, but I planned out this look....

PIETRO	Believe me, it’s for your own good.

CASSANDRA	Hm?

HUGO	And me?

PIETRO	Enjoy the buffer, but drink in moderation, sil vous plait (please in french)


MULHER 1		The invite said formal attire, this man is wearing jeans and tennis shoes. I can’t allow this.

ELIZA	No, but Jonatas is with me, he’s my friend.

MULHER 1	Unfortunately there’s no way.

ELIZA	Arthur, Arthur, help please? Do something.

ARTHUR		Hey, I did, I arranged a suit for him, and this stubborn man didn’t want to use it, and he was still offended.

JONATAS	Well, of course, those clothes were ridiculous.

MAX		With those ridiculous clothes you’d get in, idiot, now you deal with it.

ELIZA	Hey, and what do I do now?

JONATAS		Go in, right? Anyway I have nothing to do with this place anyway.

ELIZA	Ah, but are you leaving?

JONATAS		If you really want it, I can stay outside here waiting for you.

ELIZA		(reac) So stay, I don’t know what’s going to happen inside, right?

JONATAS		I know, everyone is going to realize that you’re the most incredible girl in the world.

ELIZA		Silly. I’m serious, I’m nervous, I don’t know, this dress, these shoes, I’m not myself, and it’s bothering me. Without you by my side, I think that...

JONATAS		You’re going to regret it! I’m going to stay outside waiting for you, and you’ll tell me how it went, how these guys drooled when they saw you.

ARTHUR	Eliza, we’ve got a schedule, ok? Let’s go.

ELIZA	Promise me you’ll stay?

JONATAS	I promise. Take advantage and bring me a snack?

MAX	Ah, finally. Come, my dear, come. My angel, come.

ARTHUR	Let’s go.

MAX	Come.

CAROLINA		Rafael, do your best, ok? If you do well at your job tonight, I can get you started off right in this market. Now if you don’t do your best, hm, then you’re out. You won’t even be able to take tourist pictures at Largo do Machado. 

RAFAEL	(Reac)

CAROLINA	(laugh)

RAFAEL	Okay, okay, you don’t have to threaten me, okay?

CAROLINA	If there’s no threat there’s no pressure.

RAFAEL		Yeah, one thing, the people from Bastille get here at what time?

CAROLINA	Any minute now, why?

RAFAEL	Well, you’ll want me to take their pictures as well?	

CAROLINA	Obviously yes.

RAFAEL	Okay.

CAROLINA	Arthur, so good that you came. (kiss – laugh)

 ARTHUR	“You can come in hot, because I’m on fire.” (laugh)

CAROLINA	Ah, for the love of God...

ARTHUR	(laugh)

CAROLINA		...I had already forgotten about this, what a disgrace you are.

ARTHUR	I’m never going to forget this for my entire life.

CAROLINA	(laugh)

ARTHUR	But I want to show you something.

CAROLINA	Hm?

ARTHUR		This is the winner of your contest, the future Total Dreamer Girl!

CAROLINA	(laugh) But this is that beggar.

ELIZA	The beggar has a name, okay cougar? It’s Eliza.

CAROLINA	What did you call me, girl?

ELIZA	A cougar. Didn’t you call me a beggar?

ARTHUR	Uh, uh Eliza...

CAROLINA	(Reac)

ARTHUR		Carolina is the editorial director of the magazine that’s promoting this contest. 

ELIZA		She can be whoever, Arthur, but she has to speak correctly with me. I never did anything to her. Rude.

CAROLINA		Look! (laugh) Ah, I’m already seeing it all, the judges are going to love your model, every time she opens that beautiful dirty mouth.

ELIZA	(Reac)

ARTHUR		You remember what we agreed on? Just smile for now.

ELIZA	I’m not seeing any reason to smile for now.

ARTHUR	Calm down.

CAROLINA		Ah, but I am, I am starting to enjoy myself now. (laugh)

ELIZA	Oh yeah? And can I know why?

CAROLINA	Well..

ARTHUR	Mac, take Eliza to the dressing rooms?

CAROLINA	(laugh)

ARTHUR		Right? I think it’s time for her to meet the other contestants. 

MAX	Uhum. Come with me. 

ELIZA	Let go of me!

MAX	And don’t complain, for once.

ELIZA	I can walk by myself. 

CAROLINA	Uh!

MAX	Come with me love.

ELIZA	No, no.

MAX	(grumble)

CAROLINA		(laugh) Ah, Arthur, do you really think that your beggar candidate is going to pass the first elimination?

ARTHUR		If I didn’t think so, I wouldn’t have bet on it. It’s all under control.

CAROLINA	Uhum. I’ve already won.

ARTHUR	(laugh)

MAX	Hello ladies

MENINAS	Hi..

MAX	Hello

MENINAS	Hi, hi

MAX	This is Eliza, Excalibur’s candidate.	

CASSANDRA		Is that you? Whoa, you’re all dolled up, right, beggar? What’s this?

ELIZA	Try calling me a beggar one more time...

MAX	Calm down, calm down, calm down...

ELIZA	...and see what happens, girl. 

MAX	...calm down

CASSANDRA	Hey!

ELIZA	I’m here right!

CASSANDRA	Peace and love, ok? It was just a compliment.

ELIZA	Ha.

CASSANDRA		Now if you keep things all smooth like this, girl, I think you could even get second place, could you imagine? 

ELIZA	(reac)

CASSANDRA		Eliza, cha cha cha! (laugh) Crazy, she’s totally crazy.

MAX	Dear...

ELIZA	Ah, it’s tight.

MAX	...Be careful to not wrinkle this dress, ok?

ELIZA		Ah, it’s already wrinkled. Did you want me to go the whole night in these heels? Not possible, ok?

MAX	It really is not possible.

ELIZA	(reac)

MAX	Ah, my boss definetly lost this bet, and me my job.

JONATAS		Good evening, madam. Go on through, keep going, oh. Don’t worry, I’ll be here all night, ok? No one will touch your car, I’ll take care of it. (laugh)

SEGURANÇA	Hey kid, you’re provoking me, aren’t you?

JONATAS		Hey, what’s your problem, old man? Dude, you’ve already banned me from the party, you’re not going to let me make a little change here huh?

SEGURANÇA		No. This event is high class, there’s valet to park the cars. Don’t get in the way, please. Good evening.

LORENA	Good evening. Thank you.

SEGURANÇA	You’re welcome.

JONATAS	Ah, ah, what a drag.

MAX	Fecha a boca porque você "tá" (está) babando. 
	Close your mouth because you’re drooling.

LU	Hum, você precisava ver como ele ficou todo feliz com o chocolatinho que eu levei "pra" (para) ele. (riso)
	Hm, you had to see how happy he was with the chocolate that I brought him. (laugh)

MAX	You gave Rafael chocolate?

LU		Of course, it’s part of my Save Rafael project. Ah, Mac, I’m sure that I’m going to be able to cure him from this hard shell of pain and suffering, because of his ex’s death, and then I’m going to have a chance.

MAX		Got it, you’re the sweet person, that’s going to  heal the tormented bad boy and he’s going to fall in love with you!

LU	Hm?

MAX	(reac)

LU	(laugh) The end!

MAX	How great.

LU	Happy ending.

AMBOS	(laugh)

LU	It’s just hard to be the friend, you know?

MAX	I imagine so.

LU		Because he’s so sweet. But I’m holding on, I’m holding on.

MAX		Yeah, love, how can I say this in a way that won’t provoke tears in public? This is the most ridiculous thing that I’ve eve rheard in my life. This won’t work even in a D rated film. (kiss) I love you! Fabson, can I talk to you?

LU	(Reac)

FABINHO		Mom? Hey, I didn’t think I’d see you here. Isn’t today the Total Dreamer Girl event?

LILI	I wasn’t able to go. Germano just left.

FABINHO	Hold on, isn’t this contest an homage to Sofia?

LILI		Today they’re going to introduce the girls. None of them are Sofia.

FABINHO		(reac) Mom, I know that everything for you is a reminder of the death of my sister, but sometimes it seems like that’s all you want to see, mom, that the only thing you kept of Sofia was her death, and Sofia was the opposite of that, wasn’t she? She was life, happiness, and she would want to see you doing well, especially at a party for the contest that you came up with.

LEILA	If you want, we can go with you, right?

FABINHO	Of course. Mom. I’ll be by your side, always.

LILI	Thank you son.

FABINHO	Hm?

LILI		But I think that you two came here to be alone (laugh)

LEILA	(laugh)

FABINHO	(laugh)

LILI	I’m not going to get in the way anymore (laugh)

FABINHO	(laugh) Go, mom.

LILI	(kiss)

FABINHO	(kiss)

HUGO	Ah, Carolina.

CAROLINA		Are you enjoying yourself? You’ve got to see the level of the candidates...

HUGO	Carol...

CAROLINA	It’s not a lot of...

HUGO	...Is there any way we can talk for a bit?

CAROLINA	Oh, no.

HUGO	What’s wrong?

CAROLINA		Excuse me for just a moment. Ah, I’ll talk to you in a second. Pietro, for the love of God.

HUGO	Carol, don’t do this to me.

CAROLINA	Raul, I’ll talk to you, just give me a minute.

HUGO	It’s Hugo, Hugo, right? Hugo.

CAROLINA	Of course Lorena Domingos came.

PIETRO’	(reac)

CAROLINA		For the love of God, everything has to be perfect, ok? This snake loves a scandal to put in her stupid online tabloids.

PIETRO		Even more if the scandals are about you, right? The way that you two adore each other.

CAROLINA	(reac)

PIETRO		You went to destroy the woman, didn’t you, my dear? Now you handle it.

CAROLINA	Take care of it, Pietro.

PIETRO	Ok.

LORENA	Carol, my lovely.

PIETRO	Ah.

LORENA	Pietro.

PIETRO	Lo.

LORENA	How’s everything?

CAROLINA	Ah.

PIETRO	Excellent.

LORENA		I questioned coming. But wow, your event is such a success, huh?

PIETRO	(laugh)

CAROLINA	Right, and it’s barely begun.

PIETRO	That’s right.

LORENA		That’s right, this edition of the magazine is incredible! You saved money on the model announcement, right?

TODOS	(laugh)

PIETRO	Right.

RAFAEL	Excuse me.

CAROLINA	Yes, right.

RAFAEL	Excuse me, how are you?

CAROLINA	Ah.

RAFAEL	May I take a picture of you?

CAROLINA	You may.

LORENA	Oh, you so hired this photographer after all?

RAFAEL	Yes, and she’s not going to regret it.

LORENA	(reac)

CAROLINA	Yes, I hope so.

RAFAEL	Excellent, thank you.

CAROLINA	(laugh)

LORENA	You love mixing business with pleasure, right Carol?

CAROLINA		(laugh) Don’t you? To you aren’t work and pleasure synonyms? 

LORENA	(reac)

CAROLINA	(laugh)

PIETRO	(laugh)

LU	Rafa.

RAFAEL	Hm?

LU		Rafa, Pietro said that he’s just waiting for the Bastille people to get here to start the press conference.

RAFAEL	Ok.

LU	Just a minute. Hey Pietro...

RAFAEL		Charles, Charles, Charles. I might need you to cover me, ok?

CHARLES	Ok, but I’m not a photographer.

RAFAEL		No, no, no, I’m not talking about this, I’m talking about standing in front of me, literally, covering me, ok? I don’t know how Sofia’s family is going to react when they see me here, ok?

CAROLINA		Arthur, Arthur, for the love of God, save me from this crazy, that still thinks that he’s the love of my life! (reac)

ARTHUR		This is your little boyfriend Raul? I remember him well, the punch that this peasant gave me.

CAROLINA		Look at his face, he looks like a psychopath, look at him, look at him. Hm.

ARTHUR	Okay, but what do you want me to do?

CAROLINA		I want you to help me. I can already tell that he’s going to come after me the entire night. I’m scared to do something rude and he... 

ARTHUR	(reac)

CAROLINA		...explodes, creates a confusion, ruins my event, just like he did the last time.

ARTHUR	Yes, this is always a possibility, isn’t it?

CAROLINA		(reac) I know, I’m going to go outside to wait Germano, if he comes, you throw a drink on him, throw a tray, pillar, or whatever it is.

ARTHUR	Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.

CAROLINA	HI. Oh....

HUGO	Hey, Carol...

CAROLINA	I’m coming

ARTHUR	Hey ther, Raul, what’s up, what’s up?

CAROLINA	I’ll be right back.

ARTHUR	What’s up?

HUGO	My name is Hugo.

ARTHUR	How are you? Listen, Hugo. I remember you.

HUGO	I also remember you.

ARTHUR	Not holding any grudges, right 

HUGO	No way.

ARTHUR	Ah, come in for a hug.

HUGO	Okay.

GERMANO		Carolina waiting for me at the entrace! What an honor.

CAROLINA		Of course. Without you and Lili, this event wouldn’t exist. Speaking of which, where is she?

GERMANO		She didn’t come. When I think that she’s going to get better, the depression comes back. I give up, I’m not a psychologist, I’m just a husband.

CAROLINA	I’m very sorry.

GERMANO		Me too. But my life didn’t stop, and when I see a beautiful woman like you, waiting for me at the entrance, it gives me the even greater will to live.

CAROLINA	 I think it’s best for us to go in, let’s go?

CAROLINA	Doctor Germano, let’s go. (Reac) Is everything ok?

GERMANO		Everything is great. Just before we go into the party, I want to make it very clear that you’re not going to run away from me tonight.

CAROLINA		Germano, Germano. This is a public event, ok? It’s full of journalists here, please, I have no idea what you’re going to do to me.

GERMANO	I’m not going to do it alone. 

CAROLINA	(laugh) There, now your tie is in the right place, you can go freely into the event. (laugh) Lili.

GERMANO	Hi my love.

CAROLINA	So you decided to show up?

LILI	Surprised, Carolina?

AMABAS	(laugh)

LILI	And you, Germano?

GERMANO	Of course, of course I am.

LILI	Did I come at the wrong time?

CAROLINA		Quite the opposite, you arrived at the best time. Excuse me. Pietro, Pietro.

PIETRO	Hi, love.

CAROLINA	Get the photographer, please?

PIETRO	Of course. Ah, they’re here. (laugh)

CAROLINA		They’re here. Now we can go in. I want to take a picture with you, through here, come.

PIETRO	Ready?

CAROLINA	Pietro.

RAFAEL	Yes.

PIETRO		Excuse me, excuse me, come here young man, this picture is extremely important.

CAROLINA	Come, come here...

PIETRO	Come, come.

CAROLINA	...This is a great spot.

PIETRO	Come, come

CAROLINA	We have to get this moment together.

PIETRO	Ready.

CAROLINA	Let’s go.

PIETRO	(laugh)

LILI	Rafael!

GERMANO	What is my daughter’s assasin doing here?

ELIZA		If you all want to know so badly, yes, I’ve slept on the streets, and I’m not ashamed of that at all. And madam, I hope you’ll know that no one lives on the streets because they want to, I had to. And a beggar? I’m not a beggar, I always worked, I never asked for donations. I sell flowers downtown, that’s how Arthur found me.

GERMANO		Fabinho has never had to do anything with his life, understand? And I don’t think this is good for anyone. Look at me, look at me, I started from the bottom, look at you.

JONATAS		For you everything’s good, president of Bastille, now for me? I sell candy in the streets.

GERMANO		Sold. You’re going to find me on Monday, and you’re going to work for me.
	
PIETRO		At this moment, the ex romance is the sensation of the night.

CAROLINA	But everything can change, hum?

PIETRO	You’re not going to do anything, right?

CAROLINA		Don’t worry, I won’t do anything, she’s the one that’s going to meddle, it’s just a question of time.
