bobby	this is my hometown, fruit peel mountain. we are hedgehogs who love fruit. every fall,  we go to the peak to pick ripened fruit. and the mega fruit that everyone wants! does being an early bird help? no. the trail is dangerous and difficult. i can know what they’re going to do without even opening my eyes. using ropes, building hedgehog pyramids, whitewater rafting, and... what do you call that move? it’s all the same every year. no one has ever made it it’s always going t bobby o be a failure, a failure! a failure!
bobby	even when i sleep in, i can still find the mega fruit before any of you!  here comes bobby! bobby “woooooooooo hoooooooooo” hi. hey you two!  did you just leave,or are you waiting for me? wow, how did you do that?  i mean, how could you be this slow! Bobby you’ve been sawing that forever need my help?
big hedgehog	you could really help if you don’t move and don’t touch anything!
bobby	ok just kidding. but can you try a little harder like me?
the masses	come on, or the mega fruit is going to be bobby’s again!
the masses	there! it’s so tall!
bobby	that’s too much work!  it looks like too much work! gotta go. excuse me.
bobby	mega fruit, here i come! it’s too small, you can have it. i know you only belong to the best, and that’s me! i’m bobby!
mounthedgehog a	ay, it’s bobby again this year! mounthedgehog  b	stop complaining.  we should pick up the rest.
mounthedgehog a	looks like he’s getting even faster.
mounthedgehog  b	i heard he learned a move called “spike in the sky.”
mounthedgehog c	“spike in the sky?” i heard that’s impossible!
mounthedgehog b	has anyone ever seen it?
mounthedgehog a	no
mounthedgehog c	wait, there’s a big one! give it to me! cover the fruit!
mounthedgehog a	bobby, bobby,watch out!
bobby	stop! the mega fruit is mine!
tietui	yours? no one ever dared to take fruit from me.
bobby	that’s because you’ve never met me. have you ever looked at yourself in a mirror? you’re ugly. you don’t even deserve mega fruit.
tietui	buddy, you have a few spikes but you’re still a weak little hedgehog. come on, be smart and give me the mega fruit. don’t make me take it from you.
bobby	nice bracelet... but it went out of style a long time ago! okay, okay sorry you’re not cool. but maybe i’ll let you lick the mega fruit.
bobby	block! kick! back kick! bite! smash! smash! smash! smash! and smack!
hui	great, you finally woke up! he’s waking up!  see? i told you he’s going to wake up! this is great.
bobby	where am i?
hui	you must be exhausted. but here, let me give you a tour. don’t worry they’ll like you just like i do.
the pigeons	where did this strange guy come from?  he looks creepy. -it really takes all kinds to make a world...better watch out for the baby birds...
little pigeon	are you a visiting bird? you look different.
bobby	hi who am i?
hui	cool! the arms and legs are fine. cool! the eyes are fine. well... the brain? the brain... is fine... looks like you have completely recovered! but you lost all of your feathers... unfortunately.
bobby	i got injured?
hui	yes, you fell off the bridge into the mud. i pulled you out, cleaned you up, fed you... you were like my baby...
bobby	wait, what did you feed me?
hui	 so the first thing we need to do, is to find out what to call you. you’ll be… little baby. look, this is the kind of train you fell off. right above our heads... whoosh! that’s how you fell off.
bobby	so where did i come from?
hui	what? you’ve lost your memory? hold on. yes, right here. the poem says “the less you remember, the less troubles you have. dummies have the least troubles.”
bobby	so, you’re a poet?
hui	i’m the most awesome poet in the entire universe! if anyone has any problem with you, tell them you’re with me! grey
hui	 very quietly i leave,as i get full, i come back.  meat with veggies, to thee i eat. to be or not to be to eat or not to eat because i love to eat,  i put on weight.
hui	when will the moon be clear and bright?
bobby	why?!
hui	look up and you’ll find out.
bobby	why? why am i spiky all over, and why don’t i have wings, or feathers. why can’t i fly...
hui	because... your wings got injured...
bobby	so... are we the same? i’m supposed to be flying, right?
hui	 but you hurt your wings.
bobby	but still, i can fly, right?
the pigeons	is he out of his mind? did his girlfriend just dump him? how did this happen?
hui	over here! i found you friends to play with.
bobby	thanks! but i’m different from all these spiky things. see? you are definitely a bird!
the pigeons	he doesn’t even have feathers... who knows? he can’t be one of us...  he must be some weird animal...right! a weirdo...hui he is a bird! a bird!
the pigeons	now it makes 2 of them
bobby	thank you for saving my life, grey. i think i’d better go. hui go? i’d be left out again. who else will listen to my poems? i thought we were going to see lilac blossoms together.
bobby	but  i’m the only one here who can’t fly. without wings,i can’t stay... sigh. hui bobby. wait, bobby, hold on. you should leave all your unhappiness behind, and be yourself again. like a bird!
hui	look at my flying baby. he can fly now. i have the exact poem for this great moment.
bobby	do i really get to fly again?
hui	of course, what are you waiting for?  take off!life is tough but i’m tougher, and this hard world can’t break you apart!
bobby	i’m a genius! i’m flying! i can fly now!
hui	i told you, you can fly! because you are a bird!
bobby 	look at that red fruit! it looks familiar. grey, can we pick it?
hui	sure! you’re a bird,  a free bird. you can go wherever you want!
bobby	grey! grey!
hui	i’m here, are you okay?
hui	what is this place? it’s okay, don’t worry. i’m here for you!
turkey	let us out!
the birds	let us out!
radio	the virus has been spreading. health departments say the source of the infection is most likely animals. residents should be careful and avoid any interactions. they are all very dangerous at this time...
the birds	let us out!
hui	new flavor? i’ve never tried this. everyone calm down. maybe they’re taking us on a vacation, maybe there are lilac blossoms there. this tastes good. i’m here, baby. let me out first.
turkey	let us out first!
bobby	one at a time!
hui	what’s going on?
ming	stop! pull over! what kind of animal is it this time?
petboss	you again! are you looking for trouble?
bobby	look! there’s an opening there!
hui	where?
petboss	ok
bird	thank you, thank you, thank you. we’re finally free,
tietui	you again? are you taking it from me again?
bobby	what? taking what from you?
hui	you know this monster? you... you can’t hurt him!
bobby	who are you? you can’t mess with us birds!
tietui	you? birds? did you lose your mind?
bobby	grey, what’s going on?
hui	just ignore him, baby.
tietui	baby? stop playing dumb! you stupid hedgehog!
bobby	stupid hedgehog?!
tietui	you’re not gonna last long. this is human territory. your nightmare has just started!
hui	baby! follow me!
hui	why is it so dark in here? this doesn’t look right!
bobby	did he call me a stupid hedgehog?
hui	i don’t see lilac blossoms in here!
bobby	this can’t be right. what exactly am i?
hui	i don’t think we’re welcome here.
bobby	 have you seen any stupid hedgehogs before?
hui	there really is a lilac blossom here! it’s sparkling!
bobby	why is it this dark?
hui	don’t worry, the dark night gave me black eyes, but i use them to seek a love so bright! what do you think? who locked up your warm, hearts, and put a cold, heavy lock on them?
bobby	so we need a locksmith. i got it, i’ll let everyone out!
petcat	why would i want out? there’s no high-end cat food out there, not even fish bones.
petdog	that’s right. in here, i’ll eventually find an owner who would love me very much. and i wouldn’t have to worry for the rest of my life.
knooby	i’ll stay right here in the cage. it’s the safest place! how dare you yell at me! ha ha! you can’t catch me!
the beauty cat	going out is like committing suicide. the whole city is under attack by some virus. it’s only safe in here, as a pet. 
hui	the city? 
bobby	what’s that?
hui	baaby
bobby	yes that’s the fruit, that’s the fruit that always pops into my mind! let’s go! let’s go pick it!
hui	where? pick it? no, no, i’m still working on my poems!
bobby	you promised you’ll go fruit picking with me!
hui	did i? ehh... okay. but there are beautiful lilac blossoms here! ehh... okay. but there are so many welcoming fans! look, there are also yummy city food! okay, okay!  i promised i’ll get you covered!
bobby	you guys really don’t want to come out? alright. bye!
hui	bye! bye! barbecue flavor so crispy!
bobby	hurry! grey!  run! grey!look up! there’s a hole!
hui	i need to loose some weight!
bobby	grey?!
hui	i’m here. my baby.
heimei	nice to meet you. my name is blackie.
hui	hi yeah, right. baby! baby!
heimei	run!
bobby	grey is that you?	
bobby	a red fruit, i saw it.
customer	virus!  put on your masks, hurry!
bobby	hi everyone! grey? grey, where are you? grey. grey
bobby	grey! run!
tietui	shh...be quiet if you want to live.
bobby	it’s you again?
tietui	get lost. i don’t have time for you, you stupid hedgehog!
bobby	you called me stupid hedgehog again. have we met before?who am i?  where do i come from? please tell me. please tell me who i am.
tietui	why do you care? the most important thing is to survive!
bobby	you have to tell me right now!
tietui	let go of me! don’t mess with me!
bobby	who am i? where did i come from? what’s my name? you have to tell me!
tietui	since you are literally dying to know that, maybe i should help. you’re a hedgehog, you’re from fruit peel mountain, your name is bobby!
bobby	bobby.
bobby	what, what do you want? stay away! let me go! i have fruit to pick! don’t touch me! don’t touch my arm. i’m telling you, you don’t want to have mess with me. nobody wants that... no one touches my belly, stop! i said stop! what do you want... did you just put something inside of me?
ming	you look healthy.
ming	i know you don’t understand me but don’t be afraid. here, help yourself. relax. there’s nothing to be afraid of. okay little buddy, take a nap. tomorrow we’ll find you a new home, no more living on the streets or starving. but you do need to remember to get your shots, so people don’t think you guys are spreading the virus.
thinkman	i can promise you here. as soon as the time is right, we’ll do it.
scientist	please don’t push it. i think we can hear back from the authorities in 2 or 3 days.
thinkman	sometimes you need to follow your gut. i have a feeling about this case. and i’m the expert here.
scientist	but... -i... -okay,
thinkman	i have something more important going on. that’s it for today. come in!
ming	hi, dr. thinkman.
thinkman	hi xiao ming. just leave it there. 
ming	dr. thinkman, i just finished putting gps locators on all the animals.from now on we can easily track them with this device here.
thinkman	how does it work?
ming	amazing! the real time location’s margin of error can be as small as only 1 inch.
thinkman	great job. i knew you could do it.
ming	thanks. this is exactly what i want to do. by the way, when will our shelter be ready? since we can locate all the animals now, maybe we can move them in sooner.
thinkman	don’t worry. as the biggest animal lover around, i won’t let people down. let’s go for it!
thinkman	launch the “apollo plan”.
ac	yes, doctor!
acteam1	wait, what’s the plan again?
acteam2	can’t remember...
acteam1	dr. thinkman, this “polo plan”... is the “hunt and kill” plan, right?
ming	hunt and kill? why?
thinkman	xiao ming, you can leave your papers here and go now. i’ll take care of the shelter. you’re not going to use it for hunting and killing animals, are you?
ming	i’m sorry,	but i can’t let you have it now.
thinkman	the truth is... there is no animal shelter. as long as your new device can locate animals, that’s all i need. you should understand,those animals spread diseases. removing them will help humans stay healthy! get this dirty thing out of here.
ac	yes, doctor!
ming	run! run!
ac	“polo plan” launched.
thinkman	don’t worry,  we’ll use this guy to test the location device.
acteam1	here! take him! 
acteam1	go! go!upstairs, upstairs!
acteam2	yes, captain! 
acteam1	he’s up there. open the door! hurry! over there! you, this way! this way! all the way up!
bobby	i thought you were a big piece of fruit. didn’t realize you were this kind of fruit!
ac team	there he is. over there. keep going.
bobby	that’s it! right there!  i’m coming over. i’m coming. wish grey was here.
hui	here i am!  here! i! am!
bobby	grey! are you okay?
hui	yes. as long as you are here with me.
bobby	grey, i know everything now. i’m not a bird. i found someone the same species as me, a hedgehog! i’m a hedgehog too!
hui	 what hedgehog?
bobby	yes!  hedgehog! i even have a name. my name is bobby!
heimei	we have to run now, save the hugs for later!
hui	let’s go!
heimei	rock star! where are we going now?
bobby	rock star?
heimei	look! you were on the big screen and it went viral! that’s why grey came over so fast. he didn’t even eat lunch.
the crow	man, that bird can fly.
hui	i’ll try my best to protect you, baby.
heimei	his name is bobby!
bobby	it’s okay. i can be baby too.
the crow	that’s so sweet.  -are they...?
hui	where are we going?  you said you found some other animals?
bobby	there! to the forest!
heimei	great! that’s our neighborhood! let’s go!
heimei	please don’t start reading poems. just keep flying.
hui	why... are... we... still... not there?
bobby	it’s right down there!
heimei	grey, are you okay?
hui	i won’t let you go again!
heimei	okay, i don’t want to be a third wheel here. we’ll talk soon, cutie!
bobby	grey, you sure you are okay? 
hui	can they still hear us?
bobby	no, can’t even see them anymore.
hui	good, then i’m not okay.
tietui	you’re still alive?
hui	step, step, step, step, step! keep going, keep going. great,  you dodged it.
hui	bobby! baby.
hui	you were awesome!
bobby	so were you!
hui	how did you hear about this place? are there any other hedgehogs here? what do they look like?
bobby	it’s a long story.
hui	lots of adventure. look over here, such a big forest.
bobby	let’s go!
hui	that chimney was too narrow. i thought i was gonna die there, but fortunately i’ve been staying fit.  so i finally made it to the roof, but the gangster woman was right there.
bobby	the root.go! over there!
hui	you are not listening i don’t know, it feels like that blackie girl was kind of hitting on me…
bobby	where is it?
hui	not gonna happen, she’s not my type.
hui	look, lilac blossoms.
bobby	look! it’s that tree!
hui	wait for me!
bobby	grey! we found it! it’s here!
bobby	it’s here! for sure!  i know this tree!
hui	where? where are we?
bobby	it’s fruit peel mountain!
hui	where’s the mountain?
hui	so there are three caves?  one for food storage,one for... other food storage.
bobby	should be this one. listen, it’s the wind.
bobby  	let’s go.
hui	we have to go through the chimney again? it’s too dark.
hui	the dark night gave me black eyes, but i...-shhh...
hui	but i use it... to find... baby! don’t, don’t tickle me with your spikes, it’s ticklish, not here, so ticklish, baby.
hui    	baby.
bobby	i thought poets were good at giving out names. 
bobby	hi! i’m back! why is it only you two? look! grey. it’s here. so many hedgehogs! hi everyone!
hui 	i’m back!

bobby	hey, bobby. 
hui	it looks like they don’t know you. hey! all of you with spikes, i’m grey. this is my friend bobby. he’s one of you guys. your gang. do you know him? have you seen him before?
hui  	this grandpa...  
warrior	this is our chief. 
hui	mr. chief? hi! mr. chief, cheer up.  give us a smile. he had such a hard time looking for you!
bobby	everything looks so familiar here. and i remember there was this pretty... huh?
hui	kids, you must be hungry.
quill	take your spikes back. i said no spikes!
hui	mr. chief, aren’t they all hedgehogs?
hui	how... 
quill	and you!
quill	take your spikes back.
rose	you said you are one of us. why don’t you do it?
bobby	but...why? i only use my spikes to carry fruit.
quill	so you could hurt your friends.
quill	they could get hurt!
bobby	but what if the predators come? we need the spikes to fight back! -you’ll just make them angry by doing that.
quill	it’ll make things worse - we want to keep hedgehog valley safe!
bobby	hedgehog valley? isn’t it fruit peel mountain here?
warrior	of course it’s hedgehog valley. and we’ve never met you before.
hui	what? it’s not fruit peel mountain? i told you, there are no mountains here.
quill	you just said it looks familiar to you here. have you ever been here? where?
bobby	 at, at the human’s place.
warrior	he’s from the humans!
hui	don’t worry.  he was chased by the humans, and i saved him! i picked him up, and kept flying.
warrior	you have to get out of here right now!
bobby	but we’re all hedgehogs, right?
hui	and we don’t have anywhere else to go.
warrior	his spikes are too obvious. he’s going to bring us trouble.
rose	but he’s one of us,  and homeless.
quill	here we have this rule, no spikes.  just let down along your body, like soft feathers.
quill	can you do that?
hui	feathers?
hui	that’s easy.
bobby	why?
quill	because we want to survive!
bobby	you still can survive quite well with the spikes up!
quill	so here’s another rule for youno more questions! if you can follow the rules, promise us you will never put your spikes up, then we can let you stay.
warrior	but.
hui	okay, okay, okay!
hui	you don’t worry about that, chief! don’t you want to stay?
bobby	i guess so.
quill	good!  hedgehog warrior, give them some food and something to do.
hui	ahh...
heimei	here.
hui	i don’t want to eat bugs!
heimei	how can you grow bigger if you don’t eat bugs?
bobby	you said we are going to see lilac blossoms together. love. what... i’m picking it, i’m picking it right now. it’s you... i don’t need this.
rose	we are not underground here.   it’s not safe.
bobby	it’s fine
rose	okay. i’m here to apologize.
bobby	no, no, for what?
rose	you must think our rules here are weird.
bobby	honestly, a little.
rose	the chief is a real hero. but he has his own problems.
bobby	i understand. everyone has problems.
rose	really?
bobby	of course. like me, as a hedgehog, i have to live with a bird.
hui	you just heard you were a hedgehog. youre selling me out just to get girls!
heimei	have some more.
hui	i want some vegetables!
bobby	bear with him. he’s just joking.
rose	okay. thanks for understanding! i have to go now.
bobby	 okay. my name is bobby, what’s your name?
rose	i’m ... rose?
bobby	rose?
rose	i have to go.
bobby	wait!
rose	what?
bobby	nothing.  my job today is picking up fruits to make food.but you know, i’m new here, and not very familiar with this area. so…
rose	you want me to show you around?
bobby	yes! let’s go
rose	really? you were in the clouds?
bobby	i didn’t see that coming. but it was such an emergency. i had to do it.
rose	how did you do that?
bobby	with my spikes!
rose	let’s go over there, there’s more sweet fruit.
rose	i guess it’s not our lucky day today. no ripe fruits on the ground. maybe next time…
bobby	no next time when i’m here.
rose	but...
rose	chief said.
bobby	i know.
bobby	i just want to get more fruit.
rose	that’s awesome! i mean... no one can do that here!
bobby	i’m here. don’t be afraid.
bobby	it’s so beautiful here. just like my hometown.
rose	you mean fruit peel mountain?
bobby	yes.i thought this was my hometown,  but...
rose	but... sorry for letting you down.
bobby	there’s a tree like this in my hometown too, with fruits on every branch. he one on top...
rose	is the biggest, and most delicious one! but it’s up way too high, we have to wait for it to ripen, and fall to the ground.
bobby	do you want it? like right now.
rose	right now?
bobby	yes, right now! close your eyes.
rose	what?
bobby	trust me. okay, open your eyes!  i remember now! i remember everything now!
bobby	chief.  
rose	i’m sorry,
rose	i fell and hurt myself.
quill	you, come over here!
rose	we were trying to get more fruit, we found enough food to last us for a month.
quill	enough! i said this before, i won’t banish any hedgehogs unless they break the rules!
bobby	chief,there’s been a misunderstanding here.  i’m just trying to work more productively.
warrior	liar! you were trying to show off and impress her!
bobby	i didn’t lie to her!
warrior	but you lied to the chief. you promised you’ll obey the rules, and put your spikes down. you’re a liar!
bobby	i’m not!
hui	what? what’s going on? calm down, let’s talk about it. mr. chief, you know he hurt his head before, sometimes he...you know what i mean.
bobby	my head is fine! i’m a hedgehog, my name is bobby. i was born with spikes, and i’m proud of them!
rose	not now, bobby.
bobby	i didn’t mean to offend you. and i would never want to start any trouble. i used my spikes to carry more fruit.
bobby 	is there anything wrong with that?  
rose	you’d better stop…
bobby	but what about you? you are hedgehogs too. why are you wasting your greatest gift? spikes make life way easier, am i right?
rose	don’t bring up “easier life”.
quill	you have to go now, bobby.
rose	but he...
quill	just leave, right now! and never come back.
rose	dad!
bobby/hui	dad?! dad?!
hui	makes sense now. that just makes all this easier. mr. chief, come on, listen to me. he was just being silly, maybe... he’s low in calcium, and he needs vitamins. come on, like vitamin abcdegf... helps to clear his mind, also helps his craving for food.
quill	bobby, we are different. you’d better go. this is not the right place for you and your confidence.
quill	let’s go.
bobby	mr. chief, do you really want your daughter, and other hedgehogs, to live in the dark underground forever? if they could learn how to use their spikes, all of them would be much better off!
quill	hedgehog warrior, make sure they leave before dawn.
warrior	got it.
hui	so they are leaving...no, please don’t,  mr. chief, listen to me. hold on. wait for me. wait for me. wait.
hui	my babies, be good. i’ll come back to see you. okay. even if i can’t, you need to be good, and grow up.
hui?rose	don’t eat too much, because loosing weight is very painful.  -bobby!
hui	big guy, do you know what you look like standing between them? a wheel. a third wheel.
bobby	rose, come with me. i will give you a better life.
rose	but... my dad, and hedgehog valley.
warrior	none of us will violate the chief’s orders. you have to leave immediately.
hui	you’ve been zoning out the whole morning. could you please come over and help? that’s really delicious.
bobby	give it back! give it back to me!
hui	okay, okay, here you are! if you knew this would happen, you should not have done it in the first place.
bobby	rose was willing to come with me.
hui	was she? i didn’t hear that.
bobby	i’m going back!
hui	you figured it out? that’s right, why push yourself so hard. is it really that difficult to follow the rules?
bobby	no, i’m going to pick her up!
hui	what? like...kidnap her?
bobby	i’m taking her with me, to somewhere far away.
hui 	i think you should drop it. you can’t do anything now!
bobby	what do you mean?
hui	think about it, you made it pretty clear, it’s you against the chief and the whole hedgehog valley. they’ve been living that way for so long, why would they change that for you?
bobby	i don’t need them to change for me. i just want rose to understand. rose understands me!
hui	it’s hard to tell. if she wanted to go with you, she would have done it already.
bobby	are we still friends?
hui	we are, and that’s why i’m trying to stop you. if you really want to be with rose, why did you break the rules? why did you act so different? why didn’t you accept their rules? why show off your... you know what i mean?
bobby	i’m not showing off. i’m a hedgehog. i was born with my spikes. and hedgehogs should make use of their spikes!
hui	see, this is just like the chief said, the sharpness of your wit hurts people. but does that really makes you better than anyone else?
bobby	at least i’m not like some bird, with perfectly fine wings, but afraid to fly higher.
hui	whatever, you can make fun of me, and not care about my feelings.but have you ever thought about  a father’s feelings when he loses his daughter?
bobby	i don’t care!i have the right to pursue a better life.   i did nothing wrong.
hui	you’re being very selfish. you only think about yourself!
bobby	that’s it! i don’t want to hear you lecturing me anymore. i did nothing wrong!  stop talking to me like i’m some stupid bird. “baby” this, “baby that,” you really think you were protecting me? you’re nothing but a gluttonous, stupid bird who can barely fly!
hui	i hope you don’t stab yourself with your own spikes some day.
tietui	you! are you playing dumb again? you can’t get away with it this time! you owe me this!
bobby	give it back!
tietui	i called it first!
bobby	how dare you! how dare you! how dare you take it from me! you think i’ll let you?
bobby?tietui	you think so? stop... please.
tietui	stop... please. stop please. you think i just like taking things from people? it’s them! it’s all their fault! i had a home, i had a family, friends, more food than we needed, and a happy life. those humans took my home, my family. put a leash of shame on me, and left me on the street...i have no where to go. smuggling is the only way to survive. they took all i had. so i have to take what other people have. i have to feed myself, i don’t want to die on the streets in shame!
bobby	that’s how you chose the shameful life?
tietui	i didn’t get to choose anything. i just want to survive.
bobby	hope this helps.
bobby	watch out! hide!
tietui	here they come again. they’ve been stalking me all day. everywhere i go, they follow.
bobby	right.by the way,  is that thing still in your belly?
tietui	why do you ask?
bobby	that’s how they find you!
tietui 	what?
bobby	throw it up! we don’t have enough time! don’t come inside!
tietui	we can hide inside!
bobby	not before you throw that up! i’ll go distract them. you keep trying! remember, don’t come inside!
tietui	are you crazy? hey! are you okay?
bobby	still alive. no, you can’t come in...
tietui	whatever. i have to survive!
thinkman	everybody spread out, seal this area and search it carefully.
acteam1	but, dr. thinkman, it’s getting dark.
thinkman	everyone find your spot. and we’ll do it right at first light.
acteam	yes, sir! yes, sir!
hui	forgive you, forgive you not. forgive you, forgive you not.  forgive you,  forgive you not.
hui	sorry, i’m about to leave.
rose	where’s bobby? did you have a fight?
hui	we... you know, men always need space...
rose/hui	bobby! bobby!
hui	bobby! monster? let him go!
bobby?hui	don’t...let him go now!
bobby	don’t...
rose	bobby! are you okay?
bobby	i’m fine, don’t worry. monster saved me.
tietui	the humans did it! this guy almost died trying to save you!
rose	thank you, bobby!
bobby	we need to let the chief know. humans can get in here any second!
rose	okay, let’s go.
bobby	grey, didn’t you say you’ll take care of me forever?
hui	i don’t know. i’m just a stupid bird.
bobby	so it won’t be a problem for you  to take care of this stupid hedgehog. i’m sorry. i was wrong.
hui	baby, did you get hurt? is it painful? where did you get hurt? is it painful here?here?  what about here? oh my poor little baby!
quill	you finally brought us trouble.
rose	dad, you misunderstood him. bobby was just trying to protect hedgehog valley!
warrior	so we should thank him, huh?
quill	my biggest concern just came true. humans found us.
bobby	so let’s fight back!
warrior	fight back? how?
bobby	just fight. that’s the only option we have. chief, i used to be selfish. i even tried to take rose away from you. but i was wrong. now, no matter what happens, i just want her to stay with you, so you can protect her, and the people she wants to protect.
hui	baby... my baby...
rose	dad!
quill	then...let’s wait until you get better.
hui	you grow up so fast! what did you eat? can i take a bite... please.
rose	dad, are you going to keep quiet forever? also keep your daughter and our squad here in the dark?
quill	i just want to keep you safe!
rose	but you used to be a hero, dad. not like this. you were not afraid of anything, you never backed off,  and you were always on the front lines, leading others to fight with you.
quill	and that’s how i made that huge mistake, and lost your mom!
rose	no! mom’s death is not your fault! it was never your fault. you were just trying to give her a better life.
quill	but i feel guilty. i shouldn’t have been that aggressive and cocky. i can’t afford to take risks anymore. i can’t put you in danger!
rose	dad, our enemies are on their way here. it’s time to show them our spikes! don’t you think so?
quill	it was such a mistake to keep that guy.
rose	it’s not about bobby! if you can’t let it go, you are going to be the one who leads the hedgehogs to disaster.
quill	stop!
rose	i’m sorry, dad. but i believe mom would see this the same way.
quill	go get some rest.
hui	hey, i heard rose say the chief has saved this medicine for many years… you are fully recovered.
quill	hedgehog warrior, take everyone to a safe place! we’re in danger!
warrior	this way, this way!
rose	dad!
warrior	chief!
bobby	warrior!  over here! go! keep moving! rose, watch out!
quill	you go first!
acteam1	stop barking! when all the animals get here, dr. thinkman will give you a beautiful funeral. okay, turn off the hose. now,  blanket search the area!
acteam	yes! where’s the blanket you were talking about?
bobby	thank you, chief. you saved our lives.
quill	no, thank you.you gave rose her hero dad back!  but we are still weak and visible on the ground. it’s going to be difficult.
bobby	no, chief, we have a chance to save this place. we were born with spiky weapons. just perk them up, and we are not afraid of anything! come on, use your spikes. yes, lift them them up. come on,you can do it too!  up with your spikes! let’s fight! we’re all united!
quill	great!
bobby	look over there!
hui	air force, at your service!
hornet	shadow squad, at your service.
frog	communication squad, at your service.
tietui	cavalry, at your service! fight!
turtle	wait for us! heavy infantry, at your service!

acteam1	yes, sir!
tietui	here comes the big boss!
bobby	ready, attack! grey
hui	fight! blackie! watch me? they said get yourself a curvy girlfriend, it’ll be great.
heimei	exactly. look how skinny you are. it’s never good to be a vegetarian. 
bobby	hit them harder this time!
hui	barbecue flavor! and it’s crispy! this is going to be a legendary battle. i’ll write an epic poem about it!
quill	hit them in their weak points!
acteam1	germs! virus! i... i... i can’t breath! oh my god! the virus, the virus...
bobby	you see this, chief? when we raise our spikes, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
hui	move! what are you doing! are you all frozen?
quill	this is our home. and we’re staying here.
bobby	there must be some way.
ming	wait, hold on. stop! stop! the virus never come from them, these animals are innocent! i can prove it!
thinkman	prove it? what a waste of time. removing them is the best way!
ming	no! they also have lives, just like us!
thinkman	hahaha... no need to pity them.survival of the fittest.  this is how evolution works.
ming	nothing happening here is about survival of the fittest. you’re just killing these innocent animals!
thinkman	how naive. you’re just a joke here.  remove him! you’re asking for death. keep going! keep going! ignore the animals, run them over!
bobby	chief,  we have to attack first this time.
quill	okay. focus and crush them!
bobby	rose! calm down! i’m coming!
the masses	bobby.  -bobby. that way. watch out.  -watch out.
hui	baby. watch out...move!
thinkman	farewell,  you filthy little thing.
bobby	i was born with spikes. i’m bobby. i’ll use my spikes to protect you, because you are my friends and the people i love.
hui	look! he’s over there!
quill	is he using the legendary “spike in the sky”?
rose	what is that?
quill	it’s a move where you put all   of your strength on the spike on top your head. no,it’s too dangerous. we should stop him. are you crazy, bobby?  you could die!
rose	bobby, don’t. there must be another way. please don’t!
bobby	i have to protect rose and the people she wants to protect, no matter what.
the masses	bobby!
rose	bobby! bobby! wake up... bobby! wake up... bobby! bobby!
quill	kid, your spike.
bobby	chief, i honored my promise.
rose	dad, do you regret doing this?
quill	no, hedgehog valley finally gets over the dark memeories.
bobby	but hedgehog valley is gone!
quill	as long as it stays in our hearts, we can build a better one!
ming	actually, i just want to say, there’s a lot of misunderstanding about these animals. we did full exams on them, and it turns out they are not the source of the virus. it’s the truth! hope more people can help protect them.
reporter	we’re live from the old stadium that has been abandoned for more than 20 years. about the connection between disease and the animals, let’s hear what the scientists say.
the scientist	according to lots of experiments and research, we figured out that this epidemic disease had nothing to do with the animals. please stop hurting them.  we have also developed medication that can cure the disease.  we are going to have a healthy city in no time...
hui	very quietly i take my leave.
tietui	hey, how could you leave her.
hui	you don’t understand. love needs space. space, space. lilac blossoms! bobby! bobby! lilac blossoms! look!
quill	although i’m going to miss you a lot. i can tell how much you love him. you can go with him! about rose being with you, i’m feeling very proud of it. but...you always have to  let me know where my daughter is.
bobby	rose, wanna go with me?
rose	yes, i do!
