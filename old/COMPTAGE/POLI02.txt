polly	there's always a way! 

lila	what do you have up your sleeve?

lila	whoo hoo!  

shani 	sewer grate!

polly	oh! i know a short cut! 

lila	look! look! there’s the ship!  

griselle	come, gwen. we need to get set up for tonight's event. 

gwen	yeah! i can't wait for the concert!  

griselle	and tell me why...

gwen	because melody is a great performer who puts on a cool show?

griselle	no! because tonight's the night we complete my collection and the beginning of my rule! 

first mate	the time is seven o'clock precisely. raise the anchors!

shani	the ship's leaving!

lila	goodbye, hopes! goodbye, dreams! 

polly	i promised i'd get us to that concert, so i'll get us to that concert! 

grandma	i haven't had that much fun since i was a kid! 

polly	let’s go! 

shani	wait for me. 

polly 	come on, shani!

polly	okay, let's go -  

grandma	you’ve already shrunk four bodies, polly. be careful about over extending the powers of the locket.  

polly	right. okay, okay, then let’s do this one at a time. 

griselle	as the sponsor of this event, i must inspect the stage. alone. 

first mate	yes, ms. grande. 

griselle	gwen! what are you doing? get back here!

gwen	uh, but you said "alone."

griselle	ugh, just prep the device! 

griselle	perfect!

grandma	enjoy your concert, girls. 

polly	where are you going, grandma?

grandma	i'm not much for modern music, but i hear this ship has a scandinavian sea-salt spa!

first mate	follow me!

shani	we’d better hurry so we can get closer to the stage!

polly	or how about a backstage pass? 

lila	best seats ever! 

polly	i can't wait until the concert starts! 

fans	melody! melody! melody! 

polly	where could melody be? 

gwen	the paper eagle has landed.  mission accomplishow!

polly	go big!

polly	"polly pocket. get to melody's dressing room or melody gets it. come alone." 

lila	the first mate!

shani	hide!

first mate	the audience is about to revolt!  unless someone gets on stage soon, we'll have a riot on our hands! i will turn this ship around and go straight to port before i let a riot happen on my ship! 

lila	back to port? the concert's ruined!

polly	unless someone goes on stage. shani, you gotta sing! 

shani	me? but what about you? what about that note? 

polly	it says "alone" and we can't risk anything happening to melody. when she's safe, she has a concert to performand you have to save that concert for her! 

shani	why can't lila sing?

lila	um, my singing voice sounds like a spoon going down a garbage disposal. i stick to my strengths. 

polly	lila, can you get shani ready to perform? 

lila	now that's my number one strength.
shani	but there are, real people out there! i can't perform like melodyi'm just a kid. 

polly	you've got what it takes to save the show! 

polly	and i better be the kid who's got what it takes to help melody. 

lila	that dress is all the rage! you are so ready for the stage!

shani	maybe physically, but not mentally! 

fans	who's that? / where's melody? / somebody hurry up and sing! 

polly	melody? 

polly	melody!?

melody	oh, no, be careful! it’s a

gwen 	trap!

polly	huh? gwen, what're you

griselle	gotchya!

polly	oh boy… 

polly	melody, are you okay? 

melody	ya, i’m okay. 

polly	i’m going to get you out of here, but can you keep a secret? it’s going to be awesome... and a little weird. 

melody	don’t worry, your secret is safe with me. 

polly	okay, here we go. pocket time!

melody	that was so cool!

griselle	stop, you pint-sized pipsqueaks! 

polly	what did i say? weird right? now let’s go!

polly	under here. 

fans	where’s melody?

polly	okay, there has to be another way out--

melody	polly! 

polly	put me down, you oversized oaf!

griselle	you mean upside down?

polly	no

griselle	ooooh, the power! goodbye chaos, hello control.  time to finally shrink all the citizens of littleton. ow!

polly	c'mon! run! 

gwen	oh, gigi! 

griselle	gwen, can it! seriously, can it! 

griselle	ha!  the little brats can’t bother us anymore. 

gwen	buh-bye, polly! 

lila	shani! pretend that all the people in the audience are, um, orcs from outer space and you are captain rocco from your favorite two-parter of y-girls.  you need to sing to calm the savage beasts. 


shani	orcs from outer space? that doesn't make any sense...but if captain rocco had to do it, i guess i can try! 

lila	ladies and gentleman. boys and girls. prepare to be amazed by the vocal stylings of… shani! of course fully fashioned by, none other than yours truly. with special effects by – polly pocket! (to shani) let it rip, girl.    

teenyboppers	not bad! / cool! / wow. 

polly	hi-ya! this stinks! the only difference i made with the locket was letting it get into the wrong hands that grandma warned me about.

melody	do you hear that? 

melody	hey, that's my song! 

polly	shani's doing it. she's singing in front of all those people.

polly	we are stronger together. if she can do it, we can do it too. 

melody	looks like we got a girl with a plan. 

polly	c'mon! 

griselle	gwen, the broom! 

griselle	the door! put the broom in the door! 

gwen	right! goodbye dust on the door! 

griselle 	off with you child!

gwen	what should i do with lila?

lila	hands off the cashmere, gwen! 

griselle	on the floor with the rest of them. 

griselle	what a great-looking group! of course i picked the best to start my miniature citizen collection! 

fans	what is going on? / what's she talking about? / i am so confused

griselle	oh, i’ve been waiting a long time for this. 

griselle	come, gwen! the heir to my kingdom must watch from the safety zone. there’s going to be a lot of power pumping through that machine.  

gwen	uhh… but gigi, i thought you had to touch people to shrink them?

griselle	not with the help of my invention. pocket time! 

griselle	yes…yes!! yeeeessssss!!!! 

lila/shani	she has the locket! / get it!  

gwen	i'll stop them! 

griselle	no, no, no no. let them be the first! 

lila	what? how?

shani	she must have devised a way to channel its power, but polly’s secret.   

lila	hey, everyone! how ‘bout those special effects? 

teenyboppers	am i small? / how'd the room get so big? / it must be melody's signature special effects!/ this is so cool! 


griselle	my people! my tiny people! the power is all mine! miiine!

griselle	overloaded, but its work is done! now that i’ve got you down to size, welcome to your new home.  

teenyboppers	whoa!/ whoa! 

griselle	grandeville: a perfect town where you'll live your perfect lives and i'll be the perfect ruler! 

melody	when you said this was going to be weird, you weren’t kidding, but nice flying polly! whooo hooo! 

griselle	and now my perfect town will remain perfectly orderly, controlled and dust free!

polly	what? it can’t be. griselle somehow unleashed the powers of the pocket locket on everyone at your concert.  

melody	what do we do? 

polly	let’s get this concert started. but, griselle is not invited. 

teenyboppers	look it’s melody/ (cheers)/ she’s amazing/ 

polly 	melody! 

melody 	i got your back. 

griselle	what?! 

melody	okay, what now, polly? 

gwen  	we can go fix it, gigi!

griselle	no! we have to stay out of the shrink zone. we can't rule grandeville if we're miniature too.

melody	hey, my awesome fans! my friend polly and i have a new interactive song for you.

polly	let’s go melody fans! get up here! 

griselle	don't listen to her! she's small and insignificant! go to your new home, little ones! 

melody	everybody follow us!

polly	tiny power! 

teenyboppers	tiny power! 

griselle	uh oh! get the broom, we’ll sweep them up! 

lila	fashion tipalways have emergency ribbon nearby!

polly	everybody, tie her up! 

gwen	i don't think they're going to let us collect them! 

griselle	get your little hands away from me! 

first mate	what is going on here? 

polly	oh no. the locket! 

polly	griselle’s machine is broken. it’ll take forever to reverse this with just the locket.  

polly	i have to channel the power myself.  

first mate	nothing happens on my ship that i don't know about! let me in! 

polly	that's not the kind of guy who'll let our secret stay a secret. melody, can you get the fans to the floor?

melody	no problem!

shani	let’s do this!

melody	who’s ready to dance?

lila	careful.

melody	no polly, it’s too much! 

polly	get ready everyone.  

polly	go big! 

teenyboppers	whoa. 

first mate	what is the meaning of this!?

shani	polly!

lila	are you okay?

polly	that was... so cool! 

first mate	what is going on here, miss melody?

melody	that woman is the reason i was late! she was trying to make a mockery of your ship!

first mate	how dare anyone try to make a mockery of my ship on my watch! 

first mate	to the brig with you! i always wanted to say that! 

griselle	you'll never take meoof!

grandma	oh dear! did i do that? 

melody	weren't those special effects incredible!? 

teenyboppers	best special effects ever! / i really felt tiny! / yay!

melody	it was all thanks to my friend and special effects tech – polly pocket! come on out here polly and let’s get this concert started! 

melody	okay, i love your outfit! think i could borrow it? 

lila	you. wear. my design? 

grandma	a lot can happen during a scandinavian sea-salt soak. 

first mate	you can say that again! 

polly	do you have to go?

grandma	ohh, i can't be on vacation forever!

polly	thanks for showing me how to use it. i had a lot of fun.

grandma	and helped a lot of people. 

grandma	polly, the locket has chosen you. 

polly	me? but i thought it was for grown-ups. 

grandma	until now. you may be the smallest locket bearer, but your capacity to channel its power is greater than i’ve ever known. the world's never seen what someone so young can do with the pocket power, and, i for one, can't wait! but i have one request...

grandma	i never thought i'd have the chance to fly my plane again. thank you, polly, for fixing the locket. ready?

polly	ready. but i made a little tweak to the locket’s inscription. hope you like it.

grandma	like it? i love it! 

polly	tiny power!

polly	i'll miss you, grandma!


grandma	i'll be back to visit soon. 

lila	polly? where are you? 

shani	i really hope that was an acorn and not polly! 

polly	go, big! 

shani	thank goodness! 

lila	jumping denim jumpers! dylan joel is filming a movie in littleton!

polly	let's get pocketing!
