JENNY        Oh, whoa. He's kicking like crazy.
EDDIE        He wants out.
EDDIE        Oh! Yeah. 
JENNY        Hey.
EDDIE        What are you doing?
JENNY        They're bad for you.
EDDIE        They're tasty.
JENNY        Hand me the cooler.
JENNY        Oh, Eddie.
EDDIE        Open it.
JENNY        Oh.
JENNY        I love it.
JENNY        After my divorce,
JENNY        I never thought I'd feel complete again.
JENNY        I love our family.
EDDIE        We're gonna have one kid in college
EDDIE        and one in diapers.
JENNY        Mm.
JENNY        Oh shit, what time is it?
EDDIE        What time is Em getting in town?
JENNY        Around three.
JENNY        She's leaving right after her final.
JENNY        You better go if you wanna be back when she gets here.
EDDIE        Okay.
JENNY        Miranda, sandwich is ready.
JENNY        Miranda?
JENNY        Miranda?
EDDIE        I'm heading out.
JENNY        Look.
EDDIE        Oh.
JENNY        It's so high.
EDDIE        She'll be okay.
EDDIE        She's climbed that tree a thousand times.
JENNY        When will it stop?
JENNY        I don't know what to do anymore.
JENNY        I don't know how to help her.
EDDIE        She'll come around.
JENNY        But she hasn't.
JENNY        It's been almost a year now.
EDDIE        The doc said she needed time.
JENNY        I was too young when I had her.
EDDIE        Hey. You're a wonderful mother,
EDDIE        and you're gonna be a great mother to our son too.
JENNY        Can you take her with you?
EDDIE        Oh.
JENNY        Talk to her.
JENNY        Hey. Maybe you can get through to her.
EDDIE        Okay.
JENNY        Thank you.
EDDIE        Sorry.
JENNY        Okay.
JENNY        Call me in case you need anything.
EDDIE        Yeah.
JENNY        You okay?
MIRANDA         No.
JENNY        Look what I found in the laundry.
JENNY        Don't forget to take this at two.
JENNY        Emily will be here by the time you get home.
EDDIE        Maybe you and Em can bake some cupcakes?
JENNY        Okay. Go, go.
EDDIE        So this place we're going to,
EDDIE        to pick up the bassinet.
EDDIE        It's been in the same family for three generations.
EDDIE        They carve everything by hand.
MIRANDA        Cool.
EDDIE        Sometimes they do demonstrations in the shop.
EDDIE        Maybe we could stick around and watch.
MIRANDA        Yeah, maybe.
EDDIE        Only thing I can carve is a turkey.
MIRANDA        Why do you think I'm a vegetarian?
MIRANDA        [both chuckle]
MIRANDA        Hey, can we stop for a second?
EDDIE        Sure. Everything okay?
MIRANDA        I have to go to the bathroom.
EDDIE        Okay.
WADE        Nice to get away, huh?
EDDIE        Out in the woods?
WADE        Yeah. Remote.
EDDIE        Yeah, well--
EDDIE        have a good one.
EMILY        Surprise!
JENNY        Hi, Emily! So good to see you.
EMILY        Oh my God, you're huge.
JENNY        You're early.
EMILY        No traffic.
EMILY        And I crushed the final.
JENNY        Of course you did.
EMILY        
JENNY        Let's hope it's in the genes.
EMILY        No such luck.
EMILY        My mom was the math genius.
JENNY        Too bad.
EMILY        Look at you.
JENNY        I know.
JENNY        Three more weeks,
JENNY        but I'm ready now.
EMILY        Wow. Bag packed.
EMILY        House looks great.
EMILY        You've been busy.
JENNY        You could say that.
JENNY        Miranda helped... a little. 
EMILY        Where is Miranda?
JENNY        She went with your dad.
JENNY        Are you hungry?
EMILY        Yes.
JENNY        Well, let's get you
JENNY        something to eat then.
EMILY        Thank you, thank you.
EDDIE        I know things haven't been easy on you or your mom.
EDDIE        She was alone for a long time
EDDIE        after the divorce before-- before she met me.
EDDIE        You know your mother loves you.
EDDIE        And Emily and I love you too.
EDDIE        We just...
EDDIE        we all just want you to be happy.
EDDIE        We saw you in the tree this morning.
EDDIE        Maybe you shouldn't go so high.
EDDIE        Oh, I'm sorry.
EDDIE        It's just sometimes your mom gets scared.
MIRANDA        It's-- it's not that.
EDDIE        Oh. Miranda, sweetheart.
EDDIE        You know you can talk to me about anything.
EDDIE        I wanna help you. So does your mom.
EDDIE        We all do.
EDDIE        It's just... when you get in that tree, it's--
EDDIE        it's dangerous, it's high.
EDDIE        I know... well, I don't know, but I just--
EDDIE        Yeah.
WADE        Remote, huh?
EDDIE        Oh, yeah, sure.
EDDIE        Go ahead.
EDDIE        We're in the middle of something.
WADE        Everything okay in there?
WADE        He bothering you?
MIRANDA        Fuck off.
EDDIE        Yeah, we're fine.
EDDIE        Jesus, Miranda.
MIRANDA        He's being weird.
MIRANDA        What is he--?
EDDIE        What? What do you want?
MIRANDA        Eddie!
MIRANDA        Why is he following, Eddie?
EDDIE        Oh, my God.
MIRANDA        Oh, no! Oh my God.
EDDIE        What do we do?
MIRANDA        Eddie!
MIRANDA        Eddie?
MIRANDA        Oh. Oh my God, Eddie.
MIRANDA        Oh my God, we gotta go.
MIRANDA        Please.
EDDIE        It's okay. Listen to me.
EDDIE        Listen to me.
EDDIE        You have to tell the girls.
EDDIE        You have to tell your-- your mother I love her.
EDDIE        Run. Run!
MIRANDA        No, no, no.
EDDIE        Run!
WADE        Boy, you're a real mess.
EDDIE        What's wrong with you?
WADE        Look at that.
WADE        Brought a knife to a gunfight, didn't even use it.
WADE        Mm.
WADE        Spicy.
WADE        What's your code?
WADE        So peaceful here, isn't it?
WADE        Remote.
WADE        Thank you.
WADE        Aw.
WADE        That's a good one.
EMILY        You sure you're okay?
JENNY        Positive.
JENNY        My hormones are all over the place.
EMILY        Seriously, I am here to help.
JENNY        Thank you.
EMILY        Mm. Yum.
JENNY        You have your dad's sweet tooth.
EMILY        True.
EMILY        That's definitely in the genes.
JENNY        And sunny disposition.
EMILY        He has that because of you.
JENNY        He makes me laugh.
EMILY        Really? You think he's funny?
EMILY        No wonder he loves you.
JENNY        Come on, he's funny.
JENNY        I think he's funny.
EMILY        Whatever you say.
EMILY        Oh. I got this for Anthony. Isn't he cute?
JENNY        He's adorable.
EMILY        And I got this
EMILY        from my friend who's a psych major.
EMILY        I think it might help. Dad said Miranda's
EMILY        still not doing well.
JENNY        Oh! Thank you.
JENNY        But you don't have to worry about it.
JENNY        We're taking care of it. She'll be fine.
EMILY        Good.
EMILY        They should be home soon, right?
JENNY        Yeah, they should.
JENNY        Oh. It's your dad.
EMILY        Oh.
WADE        Jenny.
WADE        God damn.
WADE        You're a lucky man.
WADE        Were.
WADE        Jesus Christ.
WADE        Come on.
SALLY        When I first saw the gun,
SALLY        I thought he was gonna shoot the dog...
SALLY        But then he just started shooting... people.
SALLY        Can I go?
SALLY        I really don't wanna be here anymore.
DEP. MORGAN        Just one moment.
DEP. MORGAN        Dwyer?
DEP. MORGAN        Hey, Dwyer?
DEP. MORGAN        Did you get a hold of the composite lady?
DEP. DWYER        What's that?
DEP. MORGAN        The composite lady.
DEP. MORGAN        Did you get a hold of her?
DEP. DWYER        Yeah, uh-- she said she could be at the station in 20 minutes.
DEP. MORGAN        All right.
SALLY        Can I go?
DEP. MORGAN        We need you to stay and help with the facial composite,
DEP. MORGAN        if that's okay.
SALLY        He looked right at me.
DEP. MORGAN        Did he say anything?
SALLY        No.
DEP. MORGAN        Nothing at all?
SALLY        "Does it matter?"
DEP. MORGAN        Well, yes, ma'am. I mean, it could help--
SALLY        No, that's what he said.
SALLY        That guy... he asked, "Why are you doing this?"
SALLY        And the man just said, "Does it matter?"
WADE        Need help?
DEP. MORGAN        "Focus your efforts
DEP. MORGAN        "on the list of duties presented in this document.
DEP. MORGAN        "Secure additional patrol units at the crime scene."
DEP. MORGAN        Not necessary.
DEP. MORGAN        "Submit updated brief to the sheriff."
DEP. MORGAN        Yeah, no can do.
DEP. MORGAN        "Run all DNA evidence through CODIS."
DEP. MORGAN        CODIS, right.
DEP. MORGAN        "If all you can do is to secure the crime scene,
DEP. MORGAN        make sure to do so."
DEP. MORGAN        Yeah, no shit.
DEP. DWYER        Hey, Morgan.
DEP. DWYER        Is there any word on that new sheriff yet?
DEP. MORGAN        No.
DEP. DWYER        Dang it.
DEP. DWYER        That's just taking forever.
DEP. MORGAN        Yeah. Recall, red tape.
DEP. DWYER        Okay. Uh-- So, we ran the prints.
DEP. MORGAN        And?
DEP. DWYER        There's not a match.
DEP. MORGAN        Shit.
DEP. DWYER        Yeah.
DEP. MORGAN        Why didn't he kill--
DEP. MORGAN        what's her name?
DEP. DWYER        Sally. That's Sally.
DEP. MORGAN        Sally. Why-- why leave a witness?
DEP. DWYER        Uh-- Maybe he thought she was cute.
DEP. MORGAN        The old man?
DEP. DWYER        Maybe it's like a-- like a control thing.
DEP. DWYER        You know how some guys get off on that?
DEP. MORGAN        Jesus.

JENNY        Emily!
JENNY        Oh, shit!
EMILY        What is it? What's wrong?
JENNY        I don't know.
JENNY        It's Miranda.
FORENSICS OFFICER        Prints from the motorcycle and inside the car
FORENSICS OFFICER        are a match to the prints from the gas pump handle
FORENSICS OFFICER        at the mini-mart crime scene.
FORENSICS OFFICER        But they don't belong to Michael Watkins
FORENSICS OFFICER        or anyone in IAFIS.
DEP. MORGAN        And CODIS?
FORENSICS OFFICER        No match.
DEP. MORGAN        All right.
DEP. MORGAN        Call me when ballistics has something.
FORENSICS OFFICER        Okay, will do.
DEP. DWYER        I'm so sorry.
DEP. DWYER        Uh-- I know that this isn't easy for you.
DEP. DWYER        Well...
DEP. DWYER        does this man look familiar to you?
JENNY        No.
DEP. DWYER        Are you sure?
DEP. DWYER        Can you give it a closer look there?
JENNY        Did he kill my husband?
DEP. DWYER        Uh-- We don't-- we don't know that yet, ma'am,
DEP. DWYER        but um-- you don't-- recognize him? You don't--
JENNY        I've never seen him before.
EMILY        No.
DEP. DWYER        We also need someone to help identify the body.
DEP. DWYER        I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
EMILY        I'll go.
JENNY        No, no.
EMILY        Yes, it makes the most sense.
EMILY        You should stay here and wait for Miranda to come home.
DEP. DWYER        Okay. Well, here's a--
DEP. DWYER        here's the direct line to the sheriff's office,
DEP. DWYER        and I also wrote down the uh-- number to a trauma center,
DEP. DWYER        just-- just in case you need someone to talk to.
JENNY        Thank you.
EMILY        I'll follow you.
JENNY        Call me when you get there.
EMILY        I will.
EMILY        We'll find her.
DEP. DWYER        Sorry. Uh...
DEP. DWYER        I'm sorry, I know that that was rough.
EMILY        I haven't seen him in months.
EMILY        I've been away at school.
EMILY        He was so happy with Jenny and the baby.
EMILY        Still no word on Miranda?
DEP. DWYER        Uh-- Well, uh-- right now, the--
DEP. DWYER        the Rangers are still out there looking for her.
DEP. DWYER        And we're organizing a volunteer search party in the morning.
EMILY        Morning?
EMILY        That's too late.
DEP. DWYER        Yeah-- Yeah. Uh--
DEP. DWYER        It's not safe to go
DEP. DWYER        into the woods until we find him.
EMILY        I have to do something. I can't just sit here.
EMILY        I can get volunteers through social media.
DEP. DWYER        Okay, that's great,
DEP. DWYER        except we're not allowed to involve civilians
DEP. DWYER        until the sheriff gets here.
EMILY        Wait, what?
EMILY        Where's the sheriff? Why isn't he here?
EMILY        Who's in charge?
DEP. DWYER        Right now, um-- Deputy Morgan is in charge,
DEP. DWYER        and I can assure you that-- that he and-- and me,
DEP. DWYER        that we are doing everything possible to find your sister.
EMILY        But you're not.
EMILY        My dad is dead, and my sister is missing.
EMILY        What are you doing about it?
DEP. DWYER        I understand that this is upsetting.
EMILY        No, you don't.
EMILY        Jesus.
JENNY        I knew. I felt it.
JENNY        Are you okay?
JENNY        Hey, Em... we're gonna get through this.
JENNY        Together.
JENNY        I love you.
JENNY        Oh...
JENNY        Oh, God.
WADE        Oh.
WADE        It's delicious. Thank you, hon.
WADE        Really?
WADE        Nance.
WADE        Excuse me.
WADE        Oh.
JENNY        Are you there?
WADE        Hi, Cupcake.
JENNY        Oh.
WADE        Hi, Cupcake.
WADE        You better stop calling. Eddie might get jealous.
WADE        I can do this all night.
JENNY        Please don't hang up.
JENNY        Please, don't hang up. I just... I just...
JENNY        I just wanted to tell you
JENNY        the police are getting a search party together.
JENNY        They're coming for you.
JENNY        So... so, if you leave now,
JENNY        you can make it out before they find you.
JENNY        Please.
JENNY        She's been through so much. She's just a little girl.
MIRANDA         Mom?
JENNY        Hello?
JENNY        Are you there?
JENNY        Look. Look, I'll stop begging.
JENNY        I-- I just want my daughter back.
JENNY        Please. Tell me what to do.
JENNY        I'll do anything.
JENNY        Are you there?
JENNY        What happened to your cheek?
JENNY        It looks painful.
JENNY        Did it hurt?
WADE        It's fine.
JENNY        Look, it looks like
JENNY        you've been through a lot.
JENNY        I'm sure
JENNY        you don't want to hurt a child.
JENNY        You still have time to leave.
JENNY         Are you there?
JENNY        She was a preemie, you know.
JENNY        Miranda. My daughter.
JENNY        She's having a difficult time... in her life.
JENNY        She lost her real dad a year ago and now--
JENNY        And now you've taken my husband.
JENNY        Please don't take my child.
JENNY         She's just a kid.
JENNY        All alone in the dark.
JENNY        Oh God.
WADE        She's not alone.
JENNY        No.
JENNY        No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
WADE        What the--?
WADE        No, no, no, no. No.
WADE        Fuck.
WADE        Fuck.
MIRANDA        Yes! Fucking A!
JENNY        Hey, I'm here, I'm here.
WADE        Nice fucking trick.
JENNY        No, no, wait, wait, wait.
JENNY        I didn't do anything.
WADE        Doesn't matter. You're all the same.
WADE        Fucking deceptive, manipulative fucking cunts.
JENNY        What are you talking about? Where's Miranda?
WADE        She's not as smart as she thinks she is.
JENNY        Please let her go.
JENNY        You're a grown man. She's just a little girl.
WADE        Well, she's about to be a dead little girl.
JENNY        Oh no, no.
JENNY        Don't touch her! Don't you fucking touch her!
JENNY        I swear to God, I'll kill you!
JENNY        I'll fucking kill you!
JENNY        If you lay a hand on her, I will hunt you down
JENNY        and rip your head off!
JENNY        No, no, no.
JENNY        Fuck. You're a fucker.
JENNY        Oh please.
JENNY        Please God, don't let him hurt her.
JENNY        Five, five...
JENNY        Hello?
JENNY        This is Jenny, Miranda's mom.
JENNY        I talked to him.
JENNY        I talked to the guy who's hunting my daughter.
DEP. MORGAN        Ma'am. Ma'am.
JENNY        The man in the composite.
DEP. MORGAN        Ma'am, slow down.
JENNY        He has Eddie's phone.
JENNY        You have to find her.
JENNY        You have to find her now or he's gonna kill her.
DEP. MORGAN        We know about Eddie's phone.
DEP. MORGAN        Wait, you-- you spoke to him?
JENNY        You-- you know about the phone?
JENNY        Why didn't you tell me?
DEP. MORGAN        How do you know he's the guy in the composite?
JENNY        Because I mentioned the cut on his face!
JENNY        You have to get out there and get her now!
JENNY        He's going to kill her, he's insane.
DEP. MORGAN        Listen to me, Jenny.
DEP. MORGAN        We're tracking both the suspect and Miranda. Okay?
DEP. MORGAN        It doesn't matter what they do.
DEP. MORGAN        Even if they turn their phones off
DEP. MORGAN        or if the battery dies, we can track them.
DEP. MORGAN        We have this under control.
DEP. MORGAN        Don't worry, the Rangers will find her.
DEP. MORGAN        Please do not engage the suspect.
JENNY         Just find her.
DEP. MORGAN        We will.
DEP. MORGAN        Pfft! Fuck!
JENNY        Miranda?
MIRANDA         Mom?
JENNY        Oh, thank God. Are you okay?
MIRANDA         I'm okay. Eddie's--
JENNY        I know.
MIRANDA         It all happened so fast.
MIRANDA         I didn't know what to do.
MIRANDA         He told me to run. I didn't want to,
MIRANDA         but he kept telling me to go.
MIRANDA         I'm so sorry, Mom.
JENNY        No, no, baby.
JENNY        No, no, no. It's not your fault.
JENNY        Hey. Listen to me.
JENNY        The Rangers are looking for you now.
JENNY        They're tracking your phone.
MIRANDA         My battery is dying.
JENNY        It's okay. They can still track you.
JENNY        Keep it with you.
JENNY        I love you so much.
JENNY        I love you so--
MIRANDA         Mom?
MIRANDA        Mom?
MIRANDA        I love you too.
DEP. DWYER        The cell towers place him within this range.
DEP. DWYER        And they're pretty sure Miranda is over here.
DEP. MORGAN        Sullivan. You copy?
RANGER SULLIVAN        Copy.
DEP. MORGAN        They're on the south end of Coyote Ridge. You in range?
RANGER SULLIVAN        Yeah. I'm heading there right now.
DEP. MORGAN        Affirmative. Stay alert. He's armed and dangerous.
RANGER SULLIVAN        Yes, sir. Copy that.
TODD        Shhh!
TODD        It's okay. It's me.
MIRANDA        Oh my God. You're alive.
TODD        I thought you were dead.
MIRANDA        You're hurt?
TODD        I'm okay. Come on.
TODD        We need to keep moving.
WADE        Survival,
WADE        the act or fact of living
WADE        or continuing longer than another person or thing.
WADE        That's the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition.
WADE        So basically, I don't have to run faster
WADE        than the man-eating tiger,
WADE        I just have to run faster than you.
EMILY        You called the others, right?
EMILY        I know, but I just can't sit here anymore
EMILY        doing nothing.
EMILY        The deputies aren't telling me anything
EMILY        and I don't even think they know what they're doing.
EMILY        I know it's dangerous, you don't have to do it.
EMILY        Okay. Thank you.
EMILY        I'll see you in an hour at the rest stop.
EMILY        And keep it quiet.
TODD        This looks safe down here.
MIRANDA        Are you sure?
TODD        It'll do for now.
MIRANDA        Are you okay?
TODD        Where did you get that?
MIRANDA        I took it from that man.
TODD        That's my mom's.
MIRANDA        I'm sorry, I didn't think.
MIRANDA        I was just gonna get it to use the flashlight.
MIRANDA        I haven't been using it, I was afraid he'd see the light.
TODD        We took this last year.
TODD        Come on.
TODD        This looks good here.
TODD        What's your name?
MIRANDA        Miranda.
TODD        Todd. 
TODD        How bad is it?
TODD        When that man started shooting, I just ran.
TODD        I ran for a while before I realized I was shot.
MIRANDA        It's still bleeding.
TODD        Why is he after you?
MIRANDA        I don't know. He...
MIRANDA        followed us from a rest stop and just started shooting.
MIRANDA        He killed my stepdad, and I just ran.
TODD        I tried to go back...
TODD        to my parents.
TODD        But he was still there.
MIRANDA        There's nothing you could've done.
MIRANDA        You're lucky you got away.
MIRANDA        It's okay. I'm not hungry.
TODD        You have the hotspot.
TODD        Do you still have your phone?
MIRANDA        I-- I called 911 and my mom.
MIRANDA        She said people are looking for me.
TODD        Thank God.
MIRANDA        But he's still out there.
MIRANDA        What do you think we should do?
TODD        I...
TODD        I think we should rest here for a while.
TODD        Is that his jacket?
MIRANDA        Yeah, I took it from him too.
TODD        Dang.
MIRANDA        Sorry, I always shake like that.
TODD        It's okay.
MIRANDA        Yeah.
TODD        I'm pretty sure there's a Ranger station somewhere nearby.
TODD        We camp here a lot.
MIRANDA        How close is it?
MIRANDA        Maybe we should make a run for it.
TODD        No, it's too dark.
TODD        I don't know which direction to go.
TODD        Let's wait 'til sunrise. I think we're safe in here.
MIRANDA        I've never been camping before.
MIRANDA        Are you okay?
MIRANDA        Here, I have meds. Do you want some?
TODD        Why do you have meds?
MIRANDA        I'm just supposed to take these every day, but I don't.
TODD        Why do you need them?
MIRANDA        Sometimes I have panic attacks.
TODD        You're pretty calm, considering.
TODD        Did you take one?
MIRANDA        I haven't taken them in weeks.
TODD        Then why have them?
MIRANDA        Doctor says they'll help.
TODD        Help what?
TODD        If you're not panicking now...
TODD        That's a lot of pills.
TODD        Why are you keeping them?
MIRANDA        A year ago, my father killed himself.
TODD        Jesus.
MIRANDA        And I was the one who found him.
TODD        My God.
MIRANDA        They tried all different kinds of drugs.
MIRANDA        They all make me feel like shit.
TODD        You don't need any of those.
TODD        There's nothing wrong with you.
TODD        You lost your dad.
TODD        It hurts.
MIRANDA        Please. It might help with the pain.
TODD        I'm glad we're in this together.
MIRANDA        Me too.
MIRANDA        Here.
DAVIS        It's fucking freezing out here.
CARLEIGH        Parker, I kinda have to pee.
EMILY        Watch your step.
PARKER        You okay?
DAVIS        Yeah.
DAVIS        You guys really think he could still be out here?
PARKER        I don't know.
BEN        Come on, guys.
BEN TO DAVIS        You okay?
DAVIS        Yeah.
EMILY        Can we hurry up, please?
CARLEIGH        Sorry.
BEN        Davis' trippin' on some crack.
CARLEIGH        Do we even know what this guy looks like?
EMILY         Yeah, I do. He's old.
CARLEIGH        I'm hoping we're not gonna see him.
BEN        Is that bone?
DAVIS        Oh fuck.
CARLEIGH        What does it look like, Ben?
PARKER        Can you just keep walking?
BEN        It looks like a bone.
DAVIS        Shut the fuck up.
EMILY        We should branch out.
BEN        Uh-- No, we should definitely stay together.
CARLEIGH        What's she saying? Okay.
PARKER TO ALL        What's that?
DAVIS        It's nothing. Just bugs. Come on.
BEN        Do you know Miranda?
PARKER        Are you sure?
DAVIS        Yes.
CARLEIGH        Met her once.
CARLEIGH        She's different.
CARLEIGH        Jesus! Put that away. What if it was Miranda?
BEN        What if it was... that guy?
CARLEIGH        Well, it wasn't.
CARLEIGH        We've been out here a while.
CARLEIGH        We're not gonna find anything.
CARLEIGH        This is kind of nuts.
CARLEIGH        Wait, where did you get that anyway?
BEN        I took it from my dad's closet.
CARLEIGH        Okay, come on.
EMILY        Guys! Come here.
EMILY        That's Miranda's.
PARKER        Oh, my God.
CARLEIGH        I can't believe we found something.
BEN        Are you sure it's hers?
EMILY        Positive.
BEN        What's that smell?
DEP. MORGAN        Sector One. Anything to report?
CMDR. SECTOR 1        Nothing yet. Slow going.
DEP. MORGAN        Slow and cautious. Perp is still at large.
CMDR. SECTOR 1        Copy.
DEP. MORGAN        Sector Two. You see anything?
CMDR. SECTOR 2        Bear shit and a dead possum.
DEP. MORGAN        Stay focused.
CMDR. SECTOR 2        Copy.
DEP. MORGAN        Thanks. Still nothing.
DEP. DWYER        I guess that could be good news.
RANGER STEVENS        Deputy Morgan? Do you copy?
DEP. MORGAN        Copy.
RANGER STEVENS        We have a situation here.
RANGER STEVENS        Two dead males. Gunshot.
DEP. MORGAN        Either one look like our suspect?
RANGER STEVENS        Negative. Looks like hunters.
DEP. MORGAN        All right.
DEP. MORGAN        Have two men secure the area.
DEP. MORGAN        Rest of you continue your search.
RANGER STEVENS        Copy that.
DEP. MORGAN        Jesus. Two more? Fuck!
OFFICER MONROE        Guys.
OFFICER MONROE        You need to see this.
WADE        That's what I mean by strategic default.
WADE        Say the value of your house
WADE        drops below what you owe on the mortgage.
WADE        What do you do?
WADE        What do you do?
WADE        You stop making payments.
WADE        Now it's not your problem. It's the bank's problem.
WADE        And fuck the bank.
WADE        So, if your business is going under, you just--
WADE        tuck your tail between your legs?
WADE        Close up shop? No.
WADE        No.
WADE        You take as much unsecured debt as you can,
WADE        in the name of the business, of course.
WADE        You cut expenses to the bone.
WADE        You leverage that cash to open a new business.
WADE        By the time the bank figures out
JENNY        Hello?
WADE        your old business is dead, you're on to your next target.
WADE        The key is to stay in the game.
WADE        Keep moving before anybody can figure out
WADE        what you're doing.
WADE        You keep moving forward like a shark. Right?
WADE        You're either predator or you're prey.
WADE        Survival of the fittest.
WADE        A simple concept,
WADE        but it's not as easy as it sounds.
WADE        You gotta take risks.
STUDENT        Yeah. Those who can't do, teach.
WADE        Why do I waste my time?
WADE        You know what, cut the camera.
WADE        Everybody get out.
WADE        What? I'm letting you go early, okay?
WADE        You're welcome.
WADE        Go. Everybody get the hell out of my classroom.
WADE        Robert.
WADE        Make sure and post the lecture today.
WADE        Don't fuck it up like last time.
WADE        And cancel my office hours. I'm going home.
LOUISE TO WADE        For Christ's sake,

JENNY        Miranda...
WADE        Hi, Cupcake.
JENNY        No! 
JENNY        What are you doing here?
JENNY        Where's my daughter? Where is she?
WADE        Calm down, Jenny.
JENNY        Why are you here?
WADE        I want you to kill me.
JENNY        What?
JENNY        You're psychotic. Where's my daughter?
JENNY        Tell me where she is.
WADE        Maybe I am. Maybe I am.
JENNY        What have you done with her? What have you done with her?
WADE        Take the fucking gun and shoot me.
WADE        Please.
WADE        Here, take the gun.
WADE        Stop asking the same question over and over, Jenny.
WADE        Here I am. Do it!
JENNY        You killed Eddie.
WADE        I did.
JENNY        You killed my husband.
JENNY        Where is my daughter? Where is she?
WADE        She's dead, Jenny! I fucking killed her!
WADE        Don't you get that?
WADE        Come on! Come on. Come here. Come here.
WADE        Come here. You can do it.
WADE        We'll do it together, okay? Come on.
WADE        I know you can do it.
WADE        You have to rack the gun, dummy.
JENNY        I can't answer the phone right now.
JENNY        You know what to do.
MEDIC        Other than mild dehydration
MEDIC        and a few scrapes and bruises, she's fine.
DEP. DWYER        Thanks.
EMILY        I can't get through. It keeps going straight to voicemail.
DEP. DWYER        Uh-- We still need her to get checked out
DEP. DWYER        by a doctor at the hospital,
DEP. DWYER        but other than that, she's in good shape.
MIRANDA        Here it is. This is where Todd is.
MIRANDA        It's almost straight in from here.
MIRANDA        I left a backpack to mark the spot.
MIRANDA        It was his mom's.
DEP. DWYER        Hey. Well, hey. Uh-- don't worry.
DEP. DWYER        We'll find him.
DEP. DWYER        The last time you saw Wade Bennett was--
DEP. DWYER        it was-- was in this area.
MIRANDA        So, that's his name.
MIRANDA        Yeah, that's it. And he was pissed.
EMILY        Hello?
WADE        Hi, Emily Cooper?
WADE        My name is Randy. I'm a nurse here
WADE        at the maternity ward,
WADE        and uh-- your mom, or your stepmom, I guess,
WADE        Jenny, is here with us.
WADE        She's very concerned about Miranda.
WADE        Can you tell me about her?
WADE        Uh-huh. Oh, that's great news.
WADE        She'll be very relieved.
WADE        Yeah. Yes, she is in labor,
WADE        but I'm sure it's still several hours away.
WADE        She would love it if you could do her a big favor
WADE        and stop by the house
WADE        to pick up her overnight bag that she left behind.
WADE        Yes. Yes, very exciting.
WADE        Little brother's on the way. Okay, bye-bye.
WADE        Our lucky day. They're on the way.
MIRANDA        I'm just so hungry.
EMILY        I'll make you a sandwich.
MIRANDA         Mom?
JENNY        Miranda?
WADE        Welcome.
MIRANDA        Get away from her!
JENNY        No, no, no, no, no. It's okay.
WADE        Hey, hey, hey.
JENNY        It's okay. It's okay.
EMILY        Oh my God.
WADE        Have a seat.
WADE        Wait.
WADE        Take it off.


WADE        Miranda, you're here next to me.
WADE        Hello, Emily Cooper. Nice to meet you in person.
WADE        We spoke on the phone.
WADE        Thanks for bringing Miranda home.
WADE        Have a seat.
WADE        This is nice.
WADE        Let's hold hands.
WADE        Bow your heads.
WADE        Close your eyes.
WADE        Dear Lord,
WADE        thank you for your random acts of betrayal,
WADE        adultery, wrath,
WADE        and violence,
WADE        for destroying families
WADE        and lives,
WADE        leaving nothing but death
WADE        and destruction in your wake.
WADE        Thank you for the rage and the thrill of the chase.
WADE        And thank you for these three beautiful women...
WADE        and for the glorious day ahead.
WADE        Amen.
WADE        Okay, the hand-holding is over now.
WADE        Let go.
WADE        Let's get started, shall we?
WADE        Sometimes when my wife was in the mood,
WADE        she enjoyed...
WADE        sharing a bottle of bubbly.
WADE        Ah. My wife.
WADE        So beautiful.
JENNY        Where is she now?
WADE        Now?
WADE        She's at home.
WADE        Where I left her.
WADE        In bed.
WADE        Dead.
MIRANDA        Did she do that to your face?
WADE        You like it?
WADE        God, you look so much like her.
MIRANDA        Is that why you chose me?
MIRANDA        Is that why you killed my stepdad
MIRANDA        and followed me through the woods?
MIRANDA        Because I look like your dead wife?
JENNY        Miranda.
MIRANDA         No, Mom.
MIRANDA        You're pathetic.
MIRANDA        You're nothing.
MIRANDA        Eddie and Todd and even my dad,
MIRANDA        who was out of his mind, were better men than you.
MIRANDA        You're a worthless piece of shit,
MIRANDA        and I look like your dead wife?
MIRANDA        But I'm not dead. I'm alive!
MIRANDA        Ah! Emily! Help me! Help me!
JENNY        Run!
MIRANDA         Mom! No, no!
MIRANDA        Get off!
MIRANDA        Stop!MIRANDA        
JENNY        Stop!
WADE        You're a quick learner, Cupcake.
WADE        It doesn't matter.
JENNY        Oh, my baby.
MIRANDA         Mom.
JENNY        Oh, no. No, no, no.
JENNY        I love you so much.
JENNY        I love you.
MIRANDA         I love you.
MIRANDA         I fixed it.
JENNY        Thank you.
MIRANDA         Eddie... Dad...
MIRANDA         The last thing he said was...
MIRANDA         "Tell your mother I love her."
MIRANDA         I'm so sorry, Mom.
JENNY        No, no, no, no, no.
JENNY        I'm sorry you had to go through that.
JENNY        I'm so sorry.
JENNY        Hey.
JENNY AND EMILY        Oh, my girls.
MIRANDA         What?
JENNY        My water broke.

JENNY        Come on. Come on.
