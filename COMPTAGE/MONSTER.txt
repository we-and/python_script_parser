GAVIN	This is a scary story?

DYLAN	Nooooo

ALEX	I don’t know, the dialogue seems pretty scary.

DYLAN	Pshhhh. Shall I continue?

ALEX	Let’s do this, bro!

DYLAN	Where was I? Oh, yeah Donny had never seen a bear, so he asked Bobby to go see it with him. Elizabeth did not think this was a good idea.

ELIZABETH	Donny Phillips, I do not think that is a good idea.

ALEX	Donny Phillips, as in our science teacher Mr. Donald Phillips?

DYLAN	Yeah, But he was way younger then.


ELIZABETH	Donny Phillips, I do not think that is a good idea.

DYLAN	Alright, now, stop Interrupting, I want to to finish this story. Now, where was I? Donny said, “We’ll be fine. Ain’t nothing out there that can scare us!”

ELIZABETH	Famous last words.

DONNY	Do you see anything Yet?

BOBBY	No, you?

DONNY	Nah.

ELIZABETH	Bobby? Donny? I don’t see your lights. Where are you?

DYLAN	And that is the legend of Foggy River.

ALEX	Lame.

DYLAN	Whatever.

GAVIN	Did the monster get them?

DYLAN	What? No, they got away. But, Mr. Phillips Swore it was real. But, after a while the other two said it was fake. So, Mr. Phillips became a local joke. That’s why he became a science Teacher.

GAVIN	So, the monster wasn’t Real?
 
ALEX	No..

DYLAN	I wouldn’t say that. I still believe he roams the woods. (beat) Like the ones behind your HOUSE! MWAHAHAHAH

GORDON	Whoa, whoa, whoa Slow down.

ALEX	Gordon Peters.

GORDON	That’s me. Did I just catch you running in the halls?

ALEX	I wasn’t running…

GORDON	Looked like running to me. And there’s a no running policy here at Murphy High.

ALEX	But, I wasn’t running.

GORDON	Looks like I’m gonna have to give you a demerit slip.

ALEX	You’re kidding, right?

GORDON	Do I look like a comedian?

ALEX	No. Just like someone who likes to give me a hard time for no reason.

GORDON	Are you talking back? Disrespecting the head hall monitor, running in the halls. Late to class. Looks like you’re gonna have fun in detention.

ALEX	WHAT? Can you even do that?

GORDON	Yup, I’m the head hall monitor, I could do anything I want.

ALEX	Like posting pictures of me sleeping.
 
GORDON	Maybe you shouldn't sleep in class. Have fun. Speedy McSpeederson.
 
ALEX	Thanks. (beat) Detention? Ah man.

MR. PHILLIPS	Why am I not surprised?

ALEX	Hello, Mr. Phillips.
 
MR. PHILLIPS	Have a seat.

DYLAN	Oh. So you come to keep me company?

ALEX	 No.
 
DYLAN	What is she doing here? She’s like the perfect student. How could she get in trouble?

ALEX	I don’t know.

DYLAN	Hey, you! Are you supposed to be in here? Hey…. Bookworm.Why do you have detention? She’s a quiet one, huh?

MR. PHILLIPS	That is correct Mr. Renner. Perhaps you should follow her Example.

DYLAN	Sorry, Mr. Phillips Won’t happen again.

GORDON	Hello Mr. Phillips.

MR. PHILLIPS	Ahhhh. Thank goodness you’re here, Gordon. Thank goodness you’re here. Ahhh Students, Gordon will be watching you for the rest of your detention period, I have an appointment which I must keep. I’m sure you will show him the same respect you show me.

DYLAN	Of course we will Mr. Phillips.

GORDON	Don’t even think about trying anything.

ALEX	What’re you doing?

DYLAN	Trust me.

GORDON	What’re you doing? Are you eating?

DYLAN	Yeah. (beat) You want some?

GORDON	Don’t mind if I do.

DYLAN	C’mon!

GORDON	What?

DYLAN	Watch this. You OK there?

GORDON	Don’t move. I’ll be right back.

DYLAN	That was epic!

ALEX	What was that?

DYLAN	I gave him a bag of sugar Free gummy bears.

ALEX	Why??

DYLAN	Cuz, everybody loves Gummy Bears. (beat) And because I read on the online reviews that it causes crazy gas!

ALEX	So, you’re planning on Being here tomorrow, too.

DYLAN	What’re you in here for?

ALEX	Gordon gave me detention.

DYLAN	What? Why?

ALEX	Cuz, he doesn’t like me.

DYLAN	He doesn’t like anyone.

ALEX	He also posted a picture of me sleeping in class today.

DYLAN	What are you doing sleeping in class?

ALEX	Ahh, my little brother kept me up all week.

DYLAN	Why?

ALEX	Cuz, He thinks there’s a monster in the house because of your stupid story.

DYLAN	That’s awesome!

ALEX	No, it’s not Awesome! He thinks there’s a monster running around the house.

PHOENIX	Odds are he’s just hearing the air conditioner going on. Or squeaky door. Or a branch hitting the window, perhaps.

DYLAN	Who asked you?

PHOENIX	No one, but it’s all very logical. Younger kids let their imagination Run their thoughts Instead of being rational. Allowing them to believe That something quite normal is really a very large beast with razor sharp Teeth wanting to eat them.

ALEX	I thought you said she was the quiet one.


PHOENIX	Maybe if you showed him that his “monster” was just random noises in the wall he wouldn’t be scared anymore.

ALEX	Doubt it. Like you said he’s got quite an imagination.

PHOENIX	Then use his imagination to show him that the monster isn’t real.

ALEX	Do you mean like Pretend to be imaginary monster fighters to fight his Monster?

DYLAN	Dude. That’s the most amazing idea I’ve ever heard.

ALEX	It is?

DYLAN	Yeah. We put together a bunch of costumes and gadgets to make it look like we

DYLAN	fight his monster but really we’re taking care of all the noisey stuff in his room so he’ll never think that there’s a monster again! What’dya think?

ALEX	Sounds crazy enough to work.

DYLAN	What about you, Uhhh Uhhhhhhhhhhhh Uhhhhhhhhhhh Uhhhhhhhhhh

PHOENIX	Phoenix.

DYLAN	That’s right.

PHOENIX	We’re in classes together

DYLAN	I know, I just forgot for a moment.

PHOENIX	You cheat off my tests.

DYLAN	Well, I don’t look at your name when I look at your paper I already know my own name. (beat) So, Phoenix Do you like my idea or not?


PHOENIX	Actually, I think you guys are onto something

ALEX	Really?

DYLAN	Of course we are.

PHOENIX	Can I help?

DYLAN	You? What can you do?

PHOENIX	I can help you to scientifically decipher the real cause of his delusions are.

DYLAN	HUH?

PHOENIX	And, I can build your gadgets.

ALEX	You make gadgets?

PHOENIX	Yeah.

DYLAN	Like what?

PHOENIX	Like this.

DYLAN	WHAT IS THAT!

PHOENIX	The thing that got me in here. Technically, It’s a battery Source that I made for science Class, but it acts more like a taser. And accidently Tased Mr. Bowmont.

DYLAN	No way!

ALEX	Ahhhh.

PHOENIX	Don’t touch it!

DYLAN	What does this do? 

PHOENIX	I told him.

ALEX	Someone’s coming Help me get him up.

GORDON	What’s his problem?

PHOENIX	Too many Gummy Bears?

DYLAN	What happened?

PHOENIX	You touched my taser when I told you not too.

DYLAN	So, are we doing the thing?

ALEX	Oh, ah, sure.

DYLAN	Awesome. Now all we need are some cool costumes, some Fancy looking equipment and a cat.

PHOENIX	A cat?

DYLAN	Yeah, after we beat the monster. We show your brother that we have him in a bag. If we have cat in the bag It’ll be moving and stuff.

PHOENIX	I am not putting a cat in a bag.

DYLAN	Fine, then you think of a way to make it look like we’ve

PHOENIX	I have an idea. What d’ya think?

ALEX	Cool!

PHOENIX	We put In the bag It moves around and your brother Thinks there’s the Monster in it.

DYLAN	This might be the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen. (beat) Why do you have it?

PHOENIX	Well, my dad makes all the props for the haunted houses around town. You can check it out.

DYLAN	Whoa...that is so cool...Whoa… your dad’s awesome!

PHOENIX	Yeah, he is pretty Great.

DYLAN	What happened to you?

ALEX	DYLAN!

DYLAN	Whoa. Check this out. HE HE HE HE HE HEEE

PHOENIX	Childish.

DYLAN	What about this?

ALEX	Ha ha.Now stop messing around and help me look for stuff that makes us look like monster hunters.

DYLAN	WE. LOOK. AWESOME.

PHOENIX	Yes we do.

DYLAN	Guys, say hello to The Monster Busters.

ALEX	The what?

DYLAN	The Monster Busters.

ALEX	Like Ghostbusters?

DYLAN	Yeah.

ALEX	I was thinking something more like The Monsterminators.

DYLAN	The what?

ALEX	The Monsterminators? Cuz we’re like monster exterminators. I took the two and put them together.


PHOENIX	Exterminator sounds a little violent.

ALEX	OK, UM… I got it! (beat) The Monster Squad.

DYLAN	That’s already been taken.

ALEX	Are you sure?

DYLAN	Yeah, my dad owns it on blu ray. (beat) He watches it all the time.

ALEX	Well, I, I…. I still vote on the Monster Squad anyway. Who’s with me?

PHOENIX	The Monster Squad sounds like we’re a squad of monsters. We’re not monsters.

ALEX	How about the creature Fighters?

SEAN	I am so sorry Mr. Phillips. He is normally a good boy.
 
KATY	We don’t know what came over him.

MR. PHILLIPS	I understand what came over them. They’re houligans. It’s you I don’t 	understand, Ashley. I cannot believe you had a party at our house while we were gone. I put my trust in you and you broke that trust.

ALEX	Mr. Phillips, it wasn’t a party. Ashley had nothing to do with this. We came over here to help Sophie.

SOPHIE	There was a monster daddy.

MR. PHILLIPS	I thought I told you to leave her alone. Now because of you she believes there are Monsters.

SOPHIE	There are monsters.

MR. PHILLIPS	Sophie, sweetie, I think it’s time for you to go to bed. Daddy’ll be up and read you some stories.

DYLAN	She’s telling you the truth. Mr. Phillips.
 
PHOENIX	It’s true. I don’t know how but it is.

MR. PHILLIPS	I don’t have time for this.

DYLAN	Tell ‘em Alex.

ALEX	Tell ‘em what? That a monster only You saw drug me around the house?

DYLAN	You don’t believe us?

ALEX	What am I supposed to believe? That a monster did all this?

ALEX	Look, all I know is because of you two Ashley’s in trouble.

DYLAN	Because of us?

ALEX	You guys have let this Monster Busting thing go to your head. (beat) I should’ve never went along with this.

DYLAN	What’re you saying?

ALEX	I’m saying I’m done with the Monster Busters.

SEAN	Come on Alex.

MR. PHILLIPS	Hey, hey

MR. PHILLIPS	Hey hey You can expect a bill once I assess the damages.

SEAN	Got it.

MR. PHILLIPS	And if I hear any of these kids doing this Monster Busting thing again, I may sue.

SEAN	I bet you will. I really don’t like That guy.

KATY	Calm down. His behavior Is

KATY	understandable.

SEAN	I still don’t like him. And now, I have to ground you.

ALEX	I didn’t do anything. It was those two.

SEAN	Well then maybe you should spend a little less time with them.

ALEX	Not a problem.

GAVIN	So you’re not a Monster Buster anymore?

ALEX	Gavin, monsters don’t Exist. They’re just the overactive imaginations of kids that need to grow up.

KATY	ALEX! You know not to talk to your brother like that.

SEAN	What has gotten in to you?

ALEX	They have.

MR. PHILLIPS	And as for you two. I’m gonna call your parents. What in the world. Ahhh, aaaahhh. Yucky. Lord almighty. Class! Class. I’m sure many of you like me will be spending time at the Foggy Creek Fair. Before you do study chapter seventeen.Enjoy. Mr. Parker.

 ALEX	Yeah, yeah. I know what you’re gonna say and I’m really sorry. But, I have to go.

DYLAN	You dropped that the other night.

ALEX	Guys, I told you, I don’t want to do this anymore.

DYLAN	And when you tossed It on the ground and threw us under the bus we read you loud and clear.

ALEX	Then why are you here?

PHOENIX	Cuz

PHOENIX	We need your help.

ALEX	Help with what?

PHOENIX	to catch this monster.

ALEX	You’ve gotta be kidding me right now.

PHOENIX	No. This is serious.

DYLAN	I haven’t been able to sleep since that night.

PHOENIX	Me neither.

ALEX	That’s because you two are victims of over active Imaginations. (beat) Maybe you should Call The Monster Busters

PHOENIX	So, you’re saying you’re not going to help us?

ALEX	I can’t.

DYLAN	C’mon Let’s go.

PHOENIX	I know that you think we’re crazy. But, we know what we saw. And we’re your friends You’re supposed to have our backs, remember? 
 
KATY	Everything OK?

ALEX	Yeah.

KATY	Still fighting with your Friends?

SEAN	They’re not my friends.

 KATY	Then how come you’re still thinking about them?

ALEX	How did you know that?

KATY	Call it a mother’s intuition. (beat) You know, why don’t you take Gavin and go meet up with them?

ALEX	Because they’re delusional. They think monsters are real. That’s crazy.

KATY	Do you remember, when you were little you were convinced you had an Imaginary friend named Billy? You wouldn’t go anywhere without him. (beat) We used to hold the door open for him, make him an imaginary plate of food.

ALEX	Yeah. (beat) Billy.

KATY	And every time you made a mess, Or broke something, You would blame Billy.

ALEX	I was a weird kid.

KATY	Yeah, but we went along with it, even though we knew he wasn’t real.

ALEX	Why?

KATY	Cuz, we loved you. And we knew eventually you’d grow out of it. And, you know what? We actually kind of missed watching you interact with him.

ALEX	So, you’re saying I should be glad my friends are out of their minds?

KATY	I’m saying they’re your friends and you should stand by them no matter how quirky they are. (beat) They’d do the same for you Wouldn’t they?

ALEX	Yeah. You’re right.

KATY	Then go, bust some monsters.

SEAN	But please, this time stay out of Mr. Phillips way.

ALEX	I’ll try. (beat) Thanks guys.
 
KATY	Hey. Aren’t you forgetting something?
 
ALEX	Oh, yeah. (beat) I love you guys.
 
SEAN	Love you, too

KATY	Love you.

DYLAN	WOW. I didn’t realize how much of the neighborhood you could see from up here.

PHOENIX	I hate heights. Why would you think I would like this?

DYLAN	I didn’t. I just told you, you would.

PHOENIX	Great.

DYLAN	Here. Take these and start looking for our monster.

ALEX	Someone call for a monster buster?

PHOENIX	Alex?

DYLAN	ALEX! I mean, what’re you doing here? Abandoner. And anything you’re about to say, isn’t gonna help.

ALEX	OK. I’m gonna try anyway. (beat) Phoenix I’ve thought about what you’ve said, and you’re right. We’re and we’re supposed to Have each others backs no matter what. Even though I may have my doubts about this Monster, I should help you guys. Cuz you’re my friends. I’m sorry, I forgot about that.

DYLAN	I forgive you, I miss you so much.

ALEX	OK, OK, I’m here now.

GAVIN	Me too.

DYLAN	Hey, Gavin. What’s up Buddy?

GAVIN	I’m here to help.

DYLAN	Oh. Cool. But aren’t you scared of monsters?

GAVIN	I’m a junior Monster Buster, I can’t be scared of monsters.

DYLAN	So, what’s the plan?

PHOENIX	I’m glad you asked. Based on our recent encounter, I thought it would be smart to up our tech. To take care of a beast of his size. Based on the pupils and sensitivity to light, I made us these.

ALEX	OHHHHH, OK OK

PHOENIX	Ultra LED lights. They’re super bright and use very little battery.

ALEX	I got it. Please turn them off.

PHOENIX	Right.They attach to this body armor I made.

DYLAN	Nice.

PHOENIX	Next we have the net Blaster. It uses CO2 canisters to shoot a large net to capture anything.

DYLAN	Ooo. Dibs.

PHOENIX	You have to reload itafter each shot. So make each shot count.

DYLAN	One shot is all I need.

PHOENIX	After that, we have the always reliable Nut Buster.

ALEX	I vote you carry that one.

PHOENIX	And finally, I made a souped up version of my taser. guaranteed to incapacitate whoever and whatever gets in it’s way. (beat) Guess this one is for you.

DYLAN	Oh, and don’t forget The old bag of fireworks. And the Big Bertha! Oh, I have another Surprise. I made this.

PHOENIX	What is that?

DYLAN	It’s a grappling hook. It shoots zipline and a tether.

ALEX	Do you really think you need one of those?

DYLAN	We absolutely do!

ALEX	Alright. So, we have the tech to take down this monster, what’s the rest of your plan?

DYLAN	We stand up here and watch until we find our monster.

ALEX	That’s it?

PHOENIX	That’s it.

ALEX	You didn’t create some kind of monster tracking device thingy?

PHOENIX	No, I was a bit busy working on everything Else.

DYLAN	Just relax and keep an eye Out. This is taking forever. What time is it?

ALEX	Don’t you have your phone?

DYLAN	No, I lost it.

ALEX	That’s not good.

DYLAN	I threw it at the monster and he ate it.

ALEX	The monster ate Your phone?

DYLAN	Yup.

ALEX	That’s awesome.

PHOENIX	It is?

ALEX	Yeah. All we have to do Is use Find My Phone to track his phone. And, if the monster ate it it’ll tell us 	Exactly where it is.

DYLAN	You’re a genius. Phoenix, gimme your Phone.

PHOENIX 	I love how I can invent all these gadgets and all Alex has to do is  is mention an app and he gets the title Genius.


DYLAN	I got it! (beat) According to this he’s only 1 mile away. Let’s go! DYLAN GERONIMOOOOOOOOO THIS IS AWESOME WHOOOOO That was awesome. I’m going to send the Tether back around to you Guys….

PHOENIX	Don’t bother.

DYLAN	How did you guys	get down here so fast?


ALEX	We used the ladder.

DYLAN	I bet that isn’t as cool as what I did.

ALEX	I bet it wasn’t.(beat) Alright, let’s go.

DYLAN	Guys, wait up, I think I tweeked my ankle. SHHHH Can you please Be quiet?

PHOENIX	You’re the one who stepped on something.

DYLAN	I know that. Just be quiet.

PHOENIX	How close are we?

PHOENIX	See how the algae creates a glow? This must be why his eyes are so sensitive. (beat) I could spend days here looking at all the flora.

DYLAN	Sounds super exciting.

ALEX	Well, Mr. Monster. It looks like our work here is done. (beat) Sorry for the whole misunderstanding thing. I guess we shouldn’t assume all Monsters are bad.

PHOENIX	I don’t know where We could have gotten idea from.

DYLAN	But, what? How was I Supposed to know?

ALEX	Do you forgive us? Ahhh, I think that’s a yes.

PHOENIX	If you don’t mind, I’m not gonna hug, so, how about a fist bump? 

DYLAN	Don’t leave me hangin’ AHHHH. That was the worst pain, ever.

ALEX	Hey, monster. The next time you have to visit the surface…. You’ll always be part of The Monster Busters.

ASHLEY	Hey…

ALEX	Yeah.
 
ASHLEY	Did you call me your girlfriend earlier?

ALEX	What? I don’t know. Maybe.

ASHLEY	That’s what i thought.

ALEX	I­ I was caught up in the moment! Besides, the monster’s not going to understand platonic friend that is a girl.

ASHLEY	You’re ridiculous.

ALEX	Hey, um Would you like to hang out with me, sometime?

ASHLEY	I thought you’d never ask.

PHOENIX	I am not kissing you, so don’t even think about it.

DYLAN	But, I...I wasn’t.

PHOENIX	Yes you were. I saw it in your pathetic little face.

MR. PHILLIPS	Tahiti.

ASHLEY	What are we gonna do with Mr. Phillips?

ALEX	Help me carry him home, I guess.  Alright. Time to go face Mr. Phillips.

PHOENIX	I told you, you shouldn’t have left him in his front lawn!

DYLAN	Hey. The man was getting heavy. Besides, after the hit he took I bet he doesn’t remember a Thing.

ALEX	Let’s hope so.

DYLAN	If he gives you any hassle just give him a bag of sugar free gummy bears.

ALEX	Sounds good.

PHOENIX	Good luck.

ALEX	Thanks guys.

ASHLEY	Hey. (beat) You’ll be fine.

MR. PHILLIPS	Turn this is in by the end of class.

ALEX	The science test? But I thought you hated me?

MR. PHILLIPS	Hate is such a strong word, Mr. Parker.I feel that perhaps I’ve been a bit too hard on you. And for that I am truly sorry.

ALEX	Why a sudden change?

MR. PHILLIPS	Well, I woke up in my yard, after a very odd dream of you kids in a cave In Tahiti. And I went inside and I decided to look at the security camera footage from the other night.

ALEX	You saw?

MR. PHILLIPS	I saw. (beat) It was nice to know One. I wasn’t so crazy All those years ago. And two. There are kids like you out there who can protect us. Go Monster Busters
 
GORDON	Hey kid. You running In the halls?
