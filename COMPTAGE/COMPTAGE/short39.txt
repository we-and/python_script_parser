 (NEAR AND FAR YONG BAO)

THOMAS	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER	Yong Bao was puffing through the Swiss Alps on his way back to China. 

STORYTELLER	He had to go through lots of tunnels...

STORYTELLER	And over lots of bridges.

STORYTELLER	He loved all the sights and all the sounds. Especially the sounds of the mountain goats.

STORYTELLER	But as he arrived at a beautiful Alpine Station, he found some confusion and delay.

STORYTELLER	'What's the matter?' Asked Yong Bao. 'None of the engines will go through the tunnel,' said the Station Master. 'So my passengers can't get home!' 'There's a monster in the tunnel!' said one of the little engines.  'And he's making scary noises!' Said the other.        

STORYTELLER	Yong Bao knew that he had to go through the tunnel to get home. 'Why don't I go and have a look?' He said. And he put his lights on.

STORYTELLER 	Yong Bao puffed slowly into the tunnel. He could hear a very strange noise. 

STORYTELLER	'That does sound very scary, maybe there is a monster in here’. But he puffed bravely on. 

STORYTELLER	Yong Bao saw strange shapes and shadows. 

STORYTELLER	And the further in he went. The louder the noise became.

STORYTELLER	'I know that noise.’

STORYTELLER	And at last, he could see what was making the noise... 

STORYTELLER	It was a mountain goat! The goat was very pleased to see Yong Bao. Follow my lights Mr Goat.' Yong Bao puffed slowly back through the tunnel. The goat followed him until they reached daylight.

STORYTELLER	'Here's your monster!' Chuckled Yong Bao. The engines were very surprised to see a Mountain Goat clopping out of the tunnel.

STORYTELLER	Everyone was very happy that it wasn't a monster... And they all gave Yong Bao a great big cheer.

STORYTELLER	'Thank you Yong Bao,' said the little engine. 'Now we can all go through the tunnel!'  'And we can all go home!' Said the passengers.

STORYTELLER	So Yong Bao led the way through the tunnel.... 

STORYTELLER	...and continued on his way to China.

THOMAS	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
