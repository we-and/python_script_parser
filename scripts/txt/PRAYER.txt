DR. KHAN	Really the sign of a good muslim

MOTWANI	Help me file a civil suit against Carbide, Rashid

MOTWANI	Biggest mosque in Asia.

MOTWANI	Bhopal is the world

MOTWANI	Hindus, muslims, christians, all - swindling each other in perfect harmony

MOTWANI	So the plant is moving to Manila?

EVA	Excuse me?

MOTWANI	Carbide. Your people are moving?

EVA	My people?

MOTWANI	You're here with Carbide, yeah?

EVA	What are you talking about?

MOTWANI	Okay, achcha hain. What are you doing here?

EVA	Interviewing Napolean

MOTWANI	Are you a relative?
EVA	Journalist

MOTWANI	Stop, stop. We'll wait for you, okay?

EVA	Le interview

NAPOLEON	You are American

EVA	Ma grand mère elle etait francaise

NAPOLEON	Mon cousin

NAPOLEON	Come in

NAPOLEON	This piece of land will be forever France

EVA	So how did the Bourbon family end up in Bhopal?

NAPOLEON	Five hundred years ago, many Europeans roamed India looking to make a fortune

NAPOLEON	Jean-Philippe Bourbon, my forefather was one of them.

NAPOLEON	I even dream in French!

MOTWANI	Five hundred years in Bhopal, and you are about as French as my brown arse.

MOTWANI	Watch out, all the citizens in the chowk are building your guillotine

NAPOLEON	Bloody communists. Never stop. Madamoiselle … I do apologise.

EVA	Will your branch of the family ever return to France?

NAPOLEON	And leave Bhopal? With barbarians at the gate?

MOTWANI	Why were you interviewing that bourgeois bastard?

EVA	Why are you following me?

MOTWANI	I'm also a journalist

MOTWANI	See. What kind of things do you write?

EVA	Lifestyle

MOTWANI	You want to write a real story?

EVA	No, my job is done

MOTWANI	What kind of a journalist are you? A job is never done

MOTWANI	Real Bhopal, real life

MOTWANI	Her husband was murdered by Carbide

EVA	That's sad. Can we go now?

MOTWANI	Train station

EVA	So what happened to him?

MOTWANI	You don't want to know.

MOTWANI	It's not lifestyle, it's life

EVA	Come on

MOTWANI	Union Carbide stores 40 tonnes of poision in the heart of Bhopal

MOTWANI	It leaks out every night

MOTWANI	That widow's husband was killed with one drop of it

EVA	Did you know him?

MOTWANI	He was my best friend

EVA	The name's Eva

MOTWANI	Wait here

MOTWANI	Welcome to the Voice of Bhopal

MOTWANI	My little empire

MOTWANI	Not exactly a multi-national but I do have total control. See

EVA	You get to pick your headlines and your enemies

MOTWANI	Enemies are like my headlines. Big, relevant and rude

EVA	So why did they choose Bhopal?

MOTWANI	Middle of nowhere and middle of everywhere

MOTWANI	Bhopal is at the heart of India

MOTWANI	Cheap government land, subsidised water and electricity, railway connections

MOTWANI	Simple logistics

EVA	So what do you want from me?

MOTWANI	I want an interview

MOTWANI	Anderson, the chairman of Carbide, is coming for his free lunch with local politicians

MOTWANI	Jobs means votes

MOTWANI	They're all milking this cash cow together

ANDERSON	No, thank you

SHANE	He's hard headed enough

ANDERSON	Everything seems smaller, more dense

TED	They've been building up without planning

SHANE	Yeah, we're building alright. Ted

ANDERSON	At least keep the sun of their heads

ANDERSON	How long have those been there, son?

GUPTA	Made six weeks ago, sir

ANDERSON	Why aren't they sold?

GUPTA	The monsoon is harder to predict these days, sir

GUPTA	Farmers are feeding their families with money they're supposed to be buying seeds and pesticides with

ANDERSON	In plain English, please

TED	The crops failed. It’s a drought

ANDERSON	Now, this looks familiar
ANDERSON	These old workhorses still going strong?

GUPTA	Yes, sir

ANDERSON	Good old American engineering

GUPTA	Yes. Welcome, sir. As you can see, we've made some changes to the control room

ANDERSON	Ya, I can see that

ANDERSON	You still doing three shifts?

GUPTA	No sir, actually, we're working with two shifts

ANDERSON	And that works for you?

GUPTA	Our safety officer, excuse me, will handle all your questions

ANDERSON	What's your name, son?

DILIP	Dilip

ANDERSON	Dilip, I'm Warren

ANDERSON	May I ask you a question, please?

ANDERSON	What is the maximum pressure for this valve?

ANDERSON	No, no. Please, let him do it

DILIP	Saab, mera kaam ispe nazar rakhna hain

CHOUDHURY	Sir, we follow a verbal protocol in Hindi

ROY	Actually he's very new, sir

ROY	High turnover so we are training them on the job, sir

ANDERSON	Is that a good safety precaution, Mr. Roy?

ROY	Well, sir, we are striving very hard to get results for our company with limited resources, sir

ANDERSON	I'm sorry, son. What's your name again?

ANDERSON	Please come with me

ANDERSON	How much MIC do we keep in here?

GUPTA	The quantity varies -

ANDERSON	For God's sake! Look at this leaky valve!

ANDERSON	How would you fix that leaky valve?

ROY	You can't smoke in here, please, take it off. Take it off! You can't smoke in here.

ANDERSON	Let me have that, please.

ANDERSON	My other collar is blue , Ted

ANDERSON	Dilip, don't pay any attention to that clown who laughed

ANDERSON	People laughed at me when I decided to build a plant here

ANDERSON	That's got it

ANDERSON	You know my father was a plumber

ANDERSON	See of you work hard enough you can achieve anything

ANDERSON	Hello, everyone!

ANDERSON	May I have your attention please

ANDERSON	Everyone please come out. Yes!

ANDERSON	Can you hear me back there?

ANDERSON	Alright. Sorry to interrupt

ANDERSON	My name is Warren Anderson

ANDERSON	I'm the chairman but first and foremost I'm a Carbider

ANDERSON	And as such I'm not going to bullshit you. We're going through a very hard time

ANDERSON	And we have limited resources

ANDERSON	But you know, when I came here ten years ago no one believed...

ANDERSON	… that we could build this factory here and we did it

ANDERSON	Now we're here to stay

ANDERSON	Together we can survive this drought

ANDERSON	Remember we're not just Carbide, we are Union Carbide

ANDERSON	United in our efforts to build a better future for everyone

ANDERSON	We have limited resources, true

ANDERSON	But we also have our minds and our hearts and our hands

ANDERSON	So gentlemen, let's use them!

ANDERSON	I thank you and God bless you all.

ANDERSON	I'll be here a few more days so look busy!

ANDERSON	Keep up the good work, Dilip.

DILIP	Kya kahan inhone?

ROY	Baarish ke liye prarthna karo, upne bhagwan se.

TED	Quite a performance, sir

ANDERSON	Thank you, Ted. You can't smoke in here

ANDERSON	Please go on, Mr. Gupta

GUPTA	I was saying that the three tanks need constant repair

ANDERSON	Which halts production, right?

GUPTA	Correct, sir

ANDERSON	Could you please explain it once again on the chart in detail the specific nature of the solution

GUPTA	Very good, sir. Simple solution

GUPTA	Insert a bypass line...

GUPTA	... a jumper line

GUPTA	Production continues regardless of repairs

GUPTA	Mass production

TED	That's a fundamental structural change. Danbury won't approve that

CHOUDHURY	The Chief Miniter is returning your call

ANDERSON	Hello, Mr. Shukla. Thank you so much for returning my call

ANDERSON	You know some of us have to work for a living

ANDERSON	Listen, my friend... confidentially...

ANDERSON	... we may need to implement some fundamental structural changes here, otherwise e may be facing closure

ANDERSON	Yes, I'm afraid it would mean the loss of great many jobs

ANDERSON	Alright, then

ANDERSON	Could you join us for supper this night?

ANDERSON	How about drinks?

ANDERSON	You can promise your lovely wife that I'll have you home by ten

ANDERSON	Meanwhile, I'd like to send the details over straight away.

ANDERSON	You know, since we'll need a confirmation as soon as possible

ANDERSON	Alright, thank you, sir

ANDERSON	I look forward to seeing you this night as well

TED	This could have serious implications, sir

ANDERSON	I'm willing to take that risk

ANDERSON	Shane, what's going on out there?

SHANE	We have some people out front

ANDERSON	You mean a demonstration

ANDERSON	So much for public relations

PLACARD 1	Who killed Rakesh?

EVA	What are they saying?

MOTWANI	Eva, they are protesting against my friend's death

PLACARD 2	Carbide out!

MOTWANI	Get them on the record

EVA	He's coming

ANDERSON	Shane, make sure the labour minister gets those designs today.

SHANE	Alright, sir. Not a problem

EVA	You call yourself a journalist? Excuse me.

ANDERSON	Stop the car

ANDERSON	You alright, miss?

EVA	Yeah. Eva Caulfield, Associated Press.

EVA	Is Carbide in trouble?

ANDERSON	You're an American

ANDERSON	Get in the car

ANDERSON	Shane, get up front, will you? We have a guest

SHANE	Can you move back here, please?

ANDERSON	Go, go, go!

MOTWANI	She works for me!

ANDERSON	You know, kid, there are easier ways to get an interveiw

ANDERSON	Okay, Miss Caufield, fire when ready

EVA	One drop of your stuff killed her husband

EVA	What exactly are you making here?

ANDERSON	MIC

EVA	Poison.

ANDERSON	How would you kill bugs?

EVA	Well, it's contained here in 40 tonne tanks...

EVA	... yet in America it's stored in small bottles. Why?

ANDERSON	We have pretty complicated regulations in the States

ANDERSON	Things are easier here, but no less safe

EVA	So you get to stash huge amount of poison in the middle of a small town?

ANDERSON	There was no town when we started We were way out in the boonies. Bhopal moved to us

EVA	And now it's a sitting time bomb

ANDERSON	Union Carbide helped build the first atomic bomb which saved millions of lives in 1945...

ANDERSON	... and we're proud of that. But we're not in the business of building time bombs

EVA	You're pretty rational about killing

ANDERSON	I deeply regret this incident

ANDERSON	But would you like to know what the biggest widow maker is in India?

ANDERSON	Malaria

ANDERSON	Carbide is helping to save lives here and just for the record, miss...

ANDERSON	... we set the highest safety standards in the industry...

ANDERSON	... and they weren't followed in this case

EVA	Isn't it your job to ensure they are?

ANDERSON	On paper, yes, but in reality it's a local issue.

EVA	What does that mean?

ANDERSON	It means that Union Carbide does not run Bhopal... ... Bhopal is run by Carbide India limited

EVA	You're the Carbide CEO, so what are you doing here?

ANDERSON	I came out of a moral obligation, frankly.

EVA	With your accountant.

TED	Who did you say you work for?

SHANE	You're working with this guy?

SHANE	He runs that rag

EVA	What? Unless I'm AP, I don't get the truth.

ANDERSON	Have I lied to you?

EVA	How do I know?

EVA	All I see is a politician passing the buck

ANDERSON	I invited you in as a pretty straight forward guy. The least you could do...

ANDERSON	... is try to ask some intelligent questions. You might even get a better story

EVA	Your factory is choking this town

ANDERSON	It stinks, okay. We're not making perfume here

ANDERSON	But this factory feeds this town

EVA	You're the boss

EVA	Why don't you stop relegating responsibilty to these locals

ANDERSON	These locals are our people. Please don't patronise them, miss

EVA	Yeah. Your people, your rules in their country

EVA	You know I was wrong about you

EVA	You're worse than a politician

EVA	You're beyond accountability

ANDERSON	You're still wrong about me, miss. I'm just a hard working yank trying to make weed killer

EVA	And I'm just a student journalist working my way up

ANDERSON	You're not with AP?

ANDERSON	Who are you with, miss?

EVA	Paris Match

ANDERSON	So much for truth

ANDERSON	Can we drop you some place?

EVA	Yeah, right here

ANDERSON	Driver, stop the car, please

ANDERSON	Hey, miss, wait up

ANDERSON	You know we all want a better world but somebosy has to break ground to build it

ANDERSON	No hard feelings

MOTWANI	Bastards throw you out?

EVA	I asked all the questions. Are you telling the truth?

MOTWANI	Hundred and ten per cent

MOTWANI	I didn't know you worked for Associated Press

EVA	I lied, okay?

MOTWANI	You're becoming a proper journalist

SHANE	You're still running this town for -

LALIT	Forget it, Shane, it's not going to happen.

LALIT	These structural changes will -

SHANE	... increase productivity and safeguard jobs.

LALIT	Sit down, my friend.

LALIT	Shane this is question time

LALIT	Carbide ka file dena

LALIT	Give me some answers

LALIT	I have to fight those hooligans

SHANE	This is a Special Operations Report. This is like a school report...

SHANE	... they're always rough

SHANE	- How did you get a hold of this

LALIT	- I didn't

LALIT	The opposition gave it to me in the morning

SHANE	The opposition?

LALIT	And now they are proposing to shut down the Carbide

SHANE	On what grounds, Lalit?

SHANE	How many times have we been through this? What’s new?

LALIT	Things have changed now.

LALIT	Those slums are legal...

LALIT	... they have votes and they have right to breathe

SHANE	Yeah, and work

SHANE	Which is what you've got to explain to these people. Let them know what's good for them sometimes

LALIT	It's a number game, Shane

LALIT	This is India, we’re also a democracy

SHANE	But in ten years, you're going to move the plant again because they going to come to us

LALIT	You're going to bribe m

SHANE	No, no. These are the fundamentals...

SHANE	... and a little grease for the cogs of democracy

LALIT	Okay, dear. Session is starting

LALIT	I need to account to my house. You get yours in order

SHANE	Scouts honor. But tell your house this -

SHANE	Carbide is not a stone that can be simply uprooted and moved else where. It’s not that easy.

SHANE	How is that for an answer?

LALIT	You are a charmer, Shane

LALIT	And an American too

LALIT	And you smile a lot

LALIT	It's confusing

LALIT	People seem to like it

LALIT	That is problem with you Americans

LALIT	You thing being liked is the same as being understood

SHANE	Understood, understood

SHANE	And make sure that document get to the higher office, okay?

SHANE	'Cause Mr. Anderson is only here a couple of days

SHANE	Thank you!

SHANE	Sir, this could have been sabotage, arson, anything. Sikh. I mean India…

SHANE	Indira Gandhi's been assassinated, their… it's power play right now

ANDERSON	It's a third world country. They're always messy


ANDERSON	Thank God we've maintained a strong relationship with the local government

ANDERSON	So our assets are protected

SHANE	Sir, it's a different game now

SHANE	We've got additional influences

ANDERSON	I'm so sorry you can't stay for supper

CHIEF MINISTER	I have scheduled trunk call from Delhi

CHIEF MINISTER	Elections, you know?

ANDERSON	Yes, of course

ANDERSON	I hope you know that you have our full support

CHIEF MINISTER	Thank you. I'll have to run it past my staff

CHIEF MINISTER	But I don't see any problem

ANDERSON	I'm glad to hear that and kindly remember me to your lovely wife

CHIEF MINISTER	Thank you very much. Nice meeting you

ANDERSON	You too, sir

ANDERSON	Smell that?

ANDERSON	Sandalwood

TED	I'm a little surprised, sir

ANDERSON	He and I go way back. It's about jobs, Ted

TED	In the middle of nowhere

TED	Making pesticides these people can't afford

ANDERSON	We came here to help build better farmers, Ted

TED	Why India?

ANDERSON	It was personal decision, really

ANDERSON	You have to go back to the sixties when India lost a war with China

ANDERSON	and crawled into bed wth the Soviet Union which made LBJ very nervous

ANDERSON	Starving Mother India bit Uncle Sam's hand, the very hand that helped stop a major famine

ANDERSON	In response, Uncle Sam said, "You want our weed? Dance to our beat"...

ANDERSON	... in the form of a new trade agreement

TED	PL 480?

ANDERSON	The very one

ANDERSON	In reply to that, India started her green revolution with hybrid seeds and fertilisers and pesticides

ANDERSON	All designed to help Indian farmers feed her own hungry millions

TED	No, thank you. PL 480

ANDERSON	India was open for business and I wanted Carbide at the heart of the revolution

ANDERSON	Plus for me personally, it was an opportunity to blend business with social responsibilty

TED	An idealist and a chairman

TED	That's a tough market to corner

ANDERSON	Yes, it is Edward

ANDERSON	And I did corner it...

ANDERSON	... and I gave something back

ANDERSON	And now I'm going inside for supper

SHANE	Sorry, guys. I was with the Labour Minister

SHANE	- Everything is fine

ANDERSON	- There you are, Shane

ANDERSON	Sit down. Tell us about Manila

SHANE	Nothing to tell. It's dull and I don't like it

ANDERSON	I'm sorry to hear that.

ANDERSON	We need you there, kid. You know we're expanding

TED	Been shopping?

SHANE	That's a gift from an employee

TED	Everything in life has a price

SHANE	That's why I went down to pay our respects to the dead man's family

TED	Of course, life is priceless

TED	How much did they expect?

ANDERSON	Do we know?

SHANE	I didn't ask. They don't

TED	Look, we're all upset about it

TED	I'm not the devil, playing his advocate

SHANE	And I'm not an accountant's advocate

SHANE	So why don't you put a price on his head or is this one of your jokes?

TED	How much extra allowance are you getting for being in Manila.

SHANE	Fifty bucks. Why?

TED	Why fifty bucks?

SHANE	It's Manila

TED	Exactly

TED	You have a very small, shall we say one in ten thousand risk of dying of an exotic diesease

TED	And you've accepted fifty bucks to take that risk

TED	Multiply fifty with ten thousand - half a million

TED	That's the price of your life

TED	- You've said it yourself

ANDERSON	- Couldn't we get him any cheaper, Ted?

SHANE	What's your point?

TED	We accept money for taking risks

TED	We pay in order to avoid them

TED	You drive a Volvo?

SHANE	No, I'm not an accountant

TED	Compensation was included in the salary. Tell the family he knew the risks

SHANE	Okay. Why don't you drive there in your Volvo and tell them yourself

TED	That's your job

TED	I'm just an accountant

SHANE	Okay, I'm sorry guys. I thought we had a corporate responsibilty to our employees. Am I wrong?

TED	No, you're quite right, Shane

TED	Our other employers -

TED	Manila, Zurich, Danbury, are subsidising Bhopal

TED	Yes, we have a responsibilty. Global

TED	Mr Anderson, we're plugging the money leak with the good will of our shareholders

TED	How long do you expect them to hold it?

ANDERSON	Gentlemen... this is the question.

ANDERSON	Red...

ANDERSON	... or white?

SHANE	I don't care, white.

TED	Red.

ANDERSON	We'll have both, thank you.

TED	Hello? Danbury?

MARK	Carbide Accounts

TED	Mark? Hello

MARK	Yeah, yeah, I'm here

TED	Oh, yeah. It's me

TED	Look...

TED	I need an excuse to shut down this plant

TED	It isn't making any money and frankly

TED	Anderson has gone all Jimmy Carter over this

MARK	Well, look. There's a million and one technical reasons you can use to shut it down

MARK	Just pull our Special Operations Report.  It's all laid out.

TED	All right...

TED	I'll look for it

TED	Mark? Thank you very much

MARK	See you when you're back

ANDERSON	Hello

ANDERSON	Where did you come from?

ANDERSON	Are you my guardian angel?

ANDERSON	What's your name?

ANDERSON	You can't speak?

ANDERSON	You don't understand.

CARBIDER	Sorry, saheb.

ANDERSON	Nah, it's okay. I'm not sleeping anyhow

CARBIDER	No, sleep, saheb

ANDERSON	I've a lot on my mind

ANDERSON	Tell me something

ANDERSON	You like Carbide?

CARBIDER	Yes, saheb.

ANDERSON	Carbide good to you?

ANDERSON	You think Carbide should stay here in Bhopal?

ANDERSON	Some don't agree

ANDERSON	Including my stockholders

ANDERSON	Some even think we’re dangerous

ANDERSON	We're pushing capacity. Which is…

ANDERSON	... saying a lot

ANDERSON	We're not making any money anyway so the question is...

ANDERSON	...  should I or should I not shut down the plant?

CARBIDER	Yes, saheb

ANDERSON	What's his name?

CARBIDER	Good boy, saheb

ANDERSON	How old is he?

ANDERSON	Good boy, I live very very far away...

ANDERSON	... and I need someone to look after the shop while I'm gone

ANDERSON	Do you think you could do that?

ANDERSON	When I come back, if you've done a good job, I'll make you the new boss

ANDERSON	You wanna be boss?

CARBIDER	Boss. Very good, saheb

ANDERSON	I'm in good hands now

ANDERSON	I can sleep tonight

ANDERSON	Thank you, gentlemen

ANDERSON	Good night
