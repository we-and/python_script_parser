JUNE	Hey crime fans.

JUNE	It's time for everyone's favorite podcast.

JUNE	"How I Met Your Murderer" with Mack Meyer.

MACK	Well, hello, dear listener.

MACK	Our story begins on that most fateful of nights

MACK	in a young person's life.

MACK	Prom night.

MACK	For some, prom is the best night of their lives.

MACK	But the idyllic fantasy is not so for everyone.

LILY	How could you?!

MACK	One night can seem perfect, frozen in time.

MACK	But is it real,

MACK	or is that just the story that we tell?

MACK	We think we may know someone,

MACK	but looks can be deceiving.

LILY	Just leave me alone!

MACK	The brutal truth is,

MACK	that everything,

LILY	Please, let me go!

MACK	Love, youth, infatuation?

MACK	Everything ends.

MACK	You know, getting in the water helps.

ANDIE	But I keep bumping into people.

ANDIE	I can't swim in a straight line.

MACK	You know, keep your head straight

MACK	then put your pinkies 11 and one.

MACK	I promise, that'll help.

ANDIE	Thanks!

ANDIE	I am such a big fan of the podcast.

ANDIE	I love this week's episode on the night stalker.

ANDIE	I listen to it before bed

ANDIE	which is not the best idea, but

ANDIE	you have such a soothing voice.

MACK	Thank you.

MACK	Mmm.

ANDIE	Gross?
MACK	So it must be good for me.

MACK	You know, I think you're the only real friend I've made

MACK	since I've moved here.

ANDIE	Trust takes time, my mom says.

ANDIE	I know school's not easy

ANDIE	when you're the weird murder mystery girl.

MACK	I am that girl!

MACK	Must be why we're friends.

MACK	I still have no idea how I ended up

MACK	with the captain of the football team.

MACK	How does that compute?

ANDIE	Oh, right.

ANDIE	Didn't he go here?

ANDIE	I think my parents know him.

MACK	He did.

MACK	He was even prom king.

ANDIE	Can I come by your studio sometime?

MACK	You better.

ANDIE	It's a date.

MACK	I gotta run.

MACK	Don't stay up all night listening to crime podcasts.

ANDIE	I definitely wanna be there for your episode

ANDIE	on the Blue Ribbon Killer.

MACK	The what?

MACK	According to Andie, the Blue Ribbon Killer

MACK	drowned three women in one summer.

MACK	It all started the summer after Henry finished high school.

JUNE	Foul play?

MACK	And unsolved.

JUNE	How did we not know about this?

JUNE	Okay, this is the best thing about you moving here.

JUNE	Besides the super cush digs.

MACK	Pretty great, right?

JUNE	For a house you inherited from your mother-in-law,

JUNE	it's pretty incredible.

MACK	I wish I got to know her better.

JUNE	Yeah.

MACK	And of course the best reason for the move

MACK	is more time with Henry.

JUNE	How could I forget?

JUNE	No, but seriously, I'm thinking multi part series.

JUNE	Or your first book.

MACK	Are you?

JUNE	Mhmm.

MACK	Tape first, then talk.

MACK	And even though his crimes took place

MACK	over the span of 13 years,

MACK	it would be more than 32 years later

MACK	before he was finally charged.

MACK	And that, dear listener, is our episode

MACK	on the Golden State Killer.

MACK	Remember, stay safe and keep your eyes and ears peeled.

MACK	Lest we forget, Liz Kloepfer,

MACK	Ted Bundy's ex-girlfriend.

MACK	Despite all the signs, she ignored her intuition

MACK	and didn't see what was right in front of her.

MACK	Look how that ended up.

MACK	Women, we are smarter than this.

MACK	So, for any of you murderers listening,

MACK	this is your warning.

MACK	We are onto you.

MACK	Please share your thoughts with me on social media

MACK	 and more importantly, you can share them with me

MACK	in person at our upcoming live taping.

MACK	As always, I'm Mack Meyer.

MACK	June Kim is our fearless producer,

MACK	and we're signing off.

MACK	Au revoir.

JUNE	Oh, wait, wait.

MACK	What, too uppy?

MACK	Before we go, I wanna let you all know

MACK	 how much I've been enjoying Pauletto Protein Powder

MACK	after my workouts.

MACK	 Serves up the protein and electrolytes you need,

MACK	 taste like my husband's gym shorts in a blender.

MACK	It tastes great.

MACK	 Make sure to use the code "murderer protein"

MACK	for a 15% discount at checkout.

MACK	As always, thanks for listening

MACK	to "How I Met You Murderer".

MACK	Au revoir, and watch your back.

JUNE	And how exactly would you know

JUNE	What Henry's shorts taste like?

MACK	Vivid imagination.

MACK	So, first recording in the new Clarksville digs.

JUNE	Yeah, how did it feel?

MACK	You know, lacks the energy of the city.

JUNE	Mhmm.

MACK	But, beats sharing a studio

MACK	with that Lego rubbing ASMR guy. 

JUNE	Oh wait, I forgot to mention.

JUNE	Did you see the comment board yesterday?

MACK	No, what's up?

JUNE	Someone claiming to be related

JUNE	to a victim of the Lover's Lane psycho

JUNE	is miffed about what you said.

MACK	What did I say?

JUNE	After seeing a picture of Neil Kincaid,

JUNE	 I can see why he was chosen by the killer.

JUNE	Exquisite bone structure.

MACK	It was a compliment!

MACK	And he does have exquisite bone structure.

JUNE	That's fine, I'll delete it.

JUNE	We had over 400,000 downloads last month

JUNE	 so your words are bound to ruffle some feathers.

MACK	No, leave it.

MACK	Everyone's entitled to their opinion.
JUNE	Someday your tombstone's gonna read

JUNE	"Was always nice to psychos."

MACK	One can only hope.

JUNE	Okay, lets dig deep on this Blue Ribbon thing.

JUNE	Victim profiles, MOs.

JUNE	Research and Pad Thai.

MACK	Oooh.

JUNE	Yum.

MACK	I don't know.

MACK	You know we're halfway through the Bundy segment

MACK	for the live taping.

MACK	And I came here to focus on my marriage,

MACK	not get wrapped up in another story.

MACK	Blue Ribbon's not going anywhere.

MACK	this afternoon, we find out.

MACK	About the in vitro?

JUNE	Yes, I'm so sorry I forgot.

JUNE	Look, don't worry about it.

JUNE	You got this one, babe.

MACK	We're both ready for some good news.

DOCTOR THOMPSON	This doesn't mean all hope is lost.

DOCTOR THOMPSON	We do have other options to consider.

HENRY	How is it possible nothing is taking?

HENRY	We're doing everything you told us to.

HENRY	 We're not eating processed foods, we're exercising,

HENRY	we're not drinking.

DOCTOR THOMPSON	Not everyone takes on the first,

DOCTOR THOMPSON	or even the second time.

DOCTOR THOMPSON	We have to continue trying.

HENRY	I'm sorry, I have to take this.

HENRY	Evelyn, has the deposition been approved?

MACK	I'm sorry about him.

MACK	It's a very important case.

MACK	Please continue.

DOCTOR THOMPSON	I was just saying, not everyone takes on the first

DOCTOR THOMPSON	or even the second time.
DOCTOR THOMPSON	But that should not discourage you

DOCTOR THOMPSON	from continuing this process.

DOCTOR THOMPSON	 I know how passionate the two of you are

DOCTOR THOMPSON	and you're very much involved.

HENRY	Just a talking show.

HENRY	Hey, I gotta go, okay?

HENRY	I'll call you back.

HENRY	Mack!

HENRY	Mackenzie!

HENRY	Mackenzie!

MACK	Do you know how humiliating that was?

HENRY	Mack, this is my first chance to sit lead chair

HENRY	with the partners.

HENRY	You know what this means to me.

MACK	Are you even disappointed that the in vitro didn't work?

HENRY	Of course I'm upset.

HENRY	How can you say that?

HENRY	I want us to have the life that we've always wanted.

MACK	How could we have the life that we've always wanted

MACK	when you're never here?

HENRY	If I drive back from the city every night,

HENRY	it's barely three hours of sleep.

HENRY	We're in the middle of a trial, Mack.

HENRY	Ugh.

MACK	Your work wife's calling again.

HENRY	Yeah, you're really going after Evelyn now?	

MACK	Well you only talk about her

MACK	every five minutes.

HENRY	Yeah we only work together.

MACK	Yeah, that hasn't stopped you before.

HENRY	I was a different person back then.

HENRY	I screwed up, okay?

HENRY	I promise

MACK	It's not gonna happen again?

MACK	Yeah, you keep mentioning that.

HENRY	How many times do I have to tell you

HENRY	I'm not sleeping with Evelyn?!

MACK	Jesus, Henry.

MACK	I'll walk.

MACK	And delete.

MACK	Well, hello again.

MACK	"You have no idea what it's like

MACK	to be the family member of a victim?

MACK	How can you be so cruel and insensitive?

MACK	You read straight from the internet

MACK	and your catch phrase is dumb."

MACK	My catch phrase is not dumb.

MACK	Au revoir and watch your back.

MACK	Ah! (cup shattering)

MACK	Oh!

OLIVER	(laughing) I didn't mean to scare you.

MACK	No, not at all.

MACK	Thank you for your help.

OLIVER	I'm sorry, but do I know you?

MACK	I don't think so.

MACK	I just moved into town.

OLIVER	No, I definitely have seen you before.

MACK	Do you happen to have an affinity

MACK	for true crime podcasts?

MACK	I do one called "How I Met Your Murderer".

OLIVER	I love that podcast!

OLIVER	But wait, I...

OLIVER	I've seen you taking out the trash.

OLIVER	I live across the street, I'm Oliver.

MACK	Mack.

OLIVER	I had no idea I was living

OLIVER	next to a real famous person, Mack.

MACK	Podcast famous, barely counts.
 
MACK	What do you do?

OLIVER	I'm actually a police officer

OLIVER	and amateur photographer.

MACK	What do you photograph?

OLIVER	I specialize in portraits, here.

OLIVER	If you do it right,

OLIVER	you can capture a glimpse of someone,

OLIVER	their true selves, and save it.

OLIVER	Forever.

MACK	Well these are terrific.

OLIVER	Thank you.

OLIVER	If you ever needed anything for your site

OLIVER	or promo stuff, it'd be my treat.

MACK	Thank you.

OLIVER	I'd love to get my work out there.

HENRY	Mack.

OLIVER	Henry.

HENRY	Oliver.

MACK	Wait, do you two know each other?

OLIVER	Henry and I went to high school together.

HENRY	Yeah, it's been a long time.

OLIVER	I was so sorry to hear about your mother's passing.

OLIVER	She was a lovely woman.

HENRY	Thank you.

HENRY	She always spoke highly of you.

MACK	We should have you over for dinner

MACK	so you two can properly catch up.

OLIVER	Yeah.

OLIVER	I'll leave you to it.

OLIVER	Nice seeing you, by the way.

OLIVER	And I'll see you on trash day.

HENRY	Mack.

HENRY	Mack.

HENRY	Listen, Mack.

HENRY	I'm sorry.

HENRY	Look, what I did back there,

HENRY	I should not have left you in there.

MACK	I needed you.

HENRY	This case has been a big distraction.
HENRY	I know that's not fair to you.

HENRY	You're my world, Mack.

HENRY	I wanna build a future and a family

HENRY	here with you.

MACK	I want all those things too.

MACK	I love you, you know that?

HENRY	I love you too.

HENRY	Oliver?

HENRY	I barely know the guy.

MACK	Didn't you grow up across the street from each other?

HENRY	We took swim lessons when we were kids

HENRY	but he was better friends with my mom

HENRY	than he was with me.

MACK	Hmm, he seems nice.

MACK	Kind of funny even.

HENRY	Maybe we were friends for a bit.

HENRY	After his parents split he got weird.

HENRY	I barely ever saw him.

HENRY	He was always by himself.

MACK	I'm thinking of asking Oliver to help with the podcast.

HENRY	What could Oliver possibly have to offer?

MACK	A lot, actually.

MACK	I mean, I need a police officer's perspective.

HENRY	On what?

MACK	The Blue Ribbon Killer.

MACK	How come you never mentioned the murders?

HENRY	Ah, dammit!

MACK	Are you okay?

HENRY	Yeah.

HENRY	I'm fine.

MACK	What do you remember about that time?

HENRY	Nothing.

HENRY	I was away at college.

MACK	See, all the more reason to ask Oliver.

MACK	He might have access to case files.

HENRY	Mack, I don't want you digging into this.

MACK	Why not?

HENRY	Because, I mean, it was a social trauma.

HENRY	I'm sure those people want to forget.

MACK	But what if I can help?

MACK	Oh, I know.

MACK	You're jealous.

HENRY	What?

MACK	Mhmm.

HENRY	Okay.

HENRY	I am not jealous of Oliver Turner.

HENRY	You know, maybe instead of turning over all the rocks,

HENRY	maybe you just wanna let it be.

MACK	Ooh, Henry, you do realize

MACK	you've made it sound even more appealing.

MACK	I love you.

MACK	You better always be here.

HENRY	Ooh.

HENRY	I like this bossy Mackenzie.

HENRY	Do you?

HENRY	I'll be back tomorrow.

MACK	Have a good day at work.

HENRY	All right, love you.

MACK	Love you.

MACK	Bye.

HENRY	Bye.

SONG	Should I hang it up ?

SONG	Can't decide, I'm going back and forth?

SONG	I've been swinging like a pendulum ?

SONG	For you ?

SONG	I've been swinging like a pendulum ?

SONG	For you ?

SONG	I'll go to bed and wake up broken hearted ?

SONG	Just one more turn and I'm back where I started ?

SONG	I've been swinging like a pendulum ?

MACK	What the?

MACK	Who is this guy?

MACK	DejaVu49, take a look at the person

MACK	you're married to?

MACK	I mean, are they implying that I am married

MACK	to a serial killer?

JUNE	I mean, I wish Henry was that interesting.

JUNE	No offense.

MACK	It's probably nothing.

MACK	Ooh, oh.

JUNE	Fertility drugs still make you dizzy?

MACK	Third time's the charm.

MACK	Oh, and I have news.

MACK	I am officially doing a deep dive

MACK	into the Blue Ribbon Killer.

JUNE	That's my girl!

MACK	It's too good to pass up.

MACK	Okay, here are the details.

MACK	The victims were all female, brunette,

MACK	18 to 23, all found missing jewelry, and wearing,

JUNE	Blue ribbons?

MACK	Exactly.

MACK	Oh, you know Henry's mom was a hoarder.

MACK	You know maybe I can dig through her newspapers

MACK	before tossing them.

MACK	There might be some information.

JUNE	Oh shoot, I gotta go.

JUNE	Big date tonight.

MACK	Have fun.

MACK	And be careful.

JUNE	Feel free to check my location later

JUNE	just in case, you know,

JUNE	it's in a ditch or something.

MACK	That's comforting.

MACK	Bye.

MACK	Hello?

MACK	Henry?
MACK	What?

OLIVER	I was outside, I heard a scream.

OLIVER	Is everything okay?

MACK	Someone threw something through the upstairs window.

OLIVER	Stay here.

OLIVER	Whoever it was must have ran off.

OLIVER	I'll call it in.

MACK	Prom queen killer?

MACK	What is that supposed to mean?

OLIVER	Come on.

OLIVER	We can wait at my house.

MACK	Thanks for talking to the officers.

OLIVER	Of course.

OLIVER	It's kind of what I do.

MACK	Also, swim champion.

MACK	Very impressive, Officer Turner.

OLIVER	Yeah, I mean it's not running down the field

OLIVER	with a thundering crowd, but I like it.

OLIVER	It's where I feel at peace.

MACK	Me too.

MACK	So, you went to high school with Henry.

MACK	Did you know Lily Brooks?

OLIVER	The town's greatest tragedy.

MACK	What happened?

OLIVER	Henry didn't tell you?

OLIVER	She had an accident on prom night.

OLIVER	Drowned in the high school pool.

MACK	Oh my god.

MACK	I do laps there.

OLIVER	Yeah, me too.

MACK	The Prom Queen Killer.

MACK	Do people think Henry killed her?

OLIVER	No.

OLIVER	Sorry, I feel weird talking about it with you.

OLIVER	Maybe Henry should explain.

MACK	Henry's not really the sharing type.

OLIVER	I mean, people had their theories,

OLIVER	and yes, there was a time when Henry

OLIVER	was the prime suspect, but in the end,

OLIVER	it was ruled an accident.

MACK	But obviously some people think it was Him

MACK	and now we're back and,

OLIVER	Maybe it's hard for people to accept.

OLIVER	Listen, me and Henry ran in completely different crowds

OLIVER	but I never thought he was capable of,

OLIVER	Henry!

HENRY	Hey.

HENRY	Are you okay?

HENRY	Are you hurt?

MACK	I'm fine.

MACK	The police, Oliver,

MACK	I think it was a one off prank.

MACK	Thank, man.

MACK	I'm glad you were there.

OLIVER	Of course.

OLIVER	If you guys need anything, just let me know.

HENRY	Come on, let's get you home.

HENRY	What are you doing?

MACK	How come you never told me about Lily Brooks

MACK	in the five years we've been together?

HENRY	When is a good time to bring up

HENRY	your dead high school girlfriend?

HENRY	Where did you find this?

MACK	Henry.

MACK	This is a major detail of your life

MACK	that you neglected to share!

MACK	Come on, you can talk to me.

HENRY	She disappeared during prom.

HENRY	Hit her head and drowned in the pool.

HENRY	End of story.

MACK	And yet the town thinks that-

HENRY	People are cruel, Mack.

HENRY	God.

HENRY	You know, I thought I had stayed away long enough

HENRY	for people to move past it, but...

HENRY	Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

HENRY	It's not something I particularly like rehashing.

MACK	You wanna talk about it?

HENRY	There's nothing to talk about.

HENRY	It was a tragic accident.

HENRY	Come to bed.

MACK	I'll be up in a sec.

MACK	Good morning, Andie.

MACK	Andie?

ANDIE	My mom doesn't want me talking to you anymore.

ANDIE	I can talk when she's gone.

ANDIE	Sorry about earlier.

MACK	What's going on?

ANDIE	My parents can be really strict

ANDIE	and they said something about your husband.

MACK	I see.

ANDIE	I still wanna be friends, but

ANDIE	I don't wanna lie to my mom.

MACK	It's all right, Andie.

MACK	You have nothing to be sorry for.

MACK	Now go work on that backstroke.

ANDIE	See ya.

MACK	See ya.

MACK	I found a ton of stuff on the Blue Ribbon Killer

MACK	from back then.

MACK	Check this out.

MACK	Victim one, Cecilia Harkins, 19.

MACK	Two, Angelica Masters, 17.

JUNE	She was even on the swim team.

MACK	And third, Brianna Park.

MACK	Weird.

MACK	Have you seen that photo of us?
MACK	I swear I put it up.

JUNE	So Henry might have killed his high school sweetheart?

MACK	No.

MACK	No, that was an accident.

MACK	Henry obviously had nothing to do with it.

MACK	Wait.

JUNE	Please and thank you?

MACK	Wait, wait, look at this.

MACK	Brunette,

MACK	young,

MACK	drowning.

MACK	What if Lily Brooks was the first victim

MACK	of the Blue Ribbon Killer?

JUNE	Mack, are you feeling okay?

MACK	Exactly.

MACK	I feel it.

MACK	Lily fits the profile and the method.

MACK	This was an outside killer.

MACK	Henry had nothing to do with it.

JUNE	Okay, Mack, all these murders happened months later

JUNE	and all in close succession.

MACK	The first doesn't always fit the pattern

MACK	because it creates the pattern.

MACK	June, my spidey sense is tingling off the charts.

MACK	If we can prove that Lily's death

MACK	was connected to this serial killer,

MACK	we can clear Henry's name.

JUNE	Not to mention bring some much needed closure

JUNE	to these poor people?

MACK	Yes, of course that.

MACK	Come on.

MACK	We need to go see my neighbor.

JUNE	Is he cute?

JUNE	Who is this?

MACK	He went to high school with Henry

MACK	and he's a cop.

OLIVER	Well, hello.

JUNE	Well hello to you too.

MACK	Oliver, this is my podcast producer June.	

JUNE	Oh, the pleasure's all mine.

MACK	We might have a lead on the Blue Ribbon Killer.

OLIVER	Oh?

MACK	Is it possible that Lily Brooks was connected

MACK	to the Blue Ribbon Killer?

OLIVER	Interesting theory.

OLIVER	Let me ask around the precinct,

OLIVER	see what I can find out.

MACK	Thank you.

MACK	We're also looking into Lily,

MACK	if you remember anything.

OLIVER	I only knew her from a distance, but

OLIVER	her cousin Chelsea Brooks still lives in town.

OLIVER	They were pretty close.

MACK	Perfect, thanks.

JUNE	Yup, we can't thank you enough, Officer.

JUNE	And you should come to our live taping.

OLIVER	I would love to.

JUNE	Great.

JUNE	If you give me your info I can email you a ticket.

MACK	Great.

JUNE	Great.

OLIVER	See you then.

JUNE	Bye.

MACK	Why would you do that?

MACK	Did you move my hormones?

HENRY	Nope.

MACK	Oliver and June are coming

MACK	to my birthday dinner together.

MACK	You do realize that my birthday dinner's

MACK	on Friday, right?

MACK	I had a breakthrough today.

MACK	On the piece I'm doing on the Blue Ribbon Killer?

HENRY	What?

MACK	The Blue Ribbon Killer.

MACK	Might even make it a feature for the live taping.	

HENRY	No, you're not.

MACK	Henry, if Lily is related to this

MACK	then I can clear your name.

HENRY	Please?

MACK	But don't you think it's strange that all of these women

MACK	were drowned and

HENRY	Maybe you should

HENRY	take a break from the podcast.

MACK	Excuse me?

HENRY	Your wild ideas aren't gonna bring anyone

HENRY	back from the dead.

HENRY	It's just for cheap entertainment.

HENRY	Look.

HENRY	I have a big day tomorrow.

HENRY	Please, can we just get some sleep?

MACK	Cheap entertainment.

MACK	Tell that to Michelle McNamara.

MACK	Thanks so much for catching that serial Killer

MACK	no one else could find.

MACK	Mmm, gotcha.

MACK	Thanks for meeting us, Chelsea.

JUNE	Can we record this?

CHELSEA	Fine.

CHELSEA	Can't believe I'm sitting across

CHELSEA	from the woman that married Henry Meyer.	

MACK	Thanks for your help.

MACK	We really wanted to make sure

MACK	that all of Lily's story gets told.

CHELSEA	Well be sure to include the part

CHELSEA	where your husband broke her heart.

CHELSEA	Prom night, she told me she was gonna end it.

CHELSEA	Now I know what she meant.

MACK	What do you mean?

CHELSEA	The truth needs to come out.

CHELSEA	That is the only reason I'm talking to you.

CHELSEA	Henry killed her.

CHELSEA	Lily committed suicide because of him.

JUNE	Suicide?

JUNE	But the newspapers

CHELSEA	Were wrong.

CHELSEA	Her parents didn't want anyone knowing

CHELSEA	that she was on antidepressants for months.

CHELSEA	Maybe because her hotshot boyfriend

CHELSEA	couldn't stay faithful to her.

CHELSEA	Prom night, she took a handful of pills

CHELSEA	and went for a swim.

MACK	So much for my intuition.

JUNE	Do you think Henry knows it was a suicide?

MACK	It's probably why he doesn't want to talk about it.

MACK	He's changed, okay?

JUNE	I didn't say anything.

MACK	Sorry.

MACK	Don't worry about it.

MACK	Well maybe Henry's right.

MACK	I should take a break from all this.

JUNE	Um, no.

JUNE	Downloads are up 15k this week

JUNE	and the live taping is sold out.

JUNE	Look, we need to give the people what they want.

JUNE	And what they want is you and murder.

JUNE	Beautiful.

MACK	Ow.

MACK	Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

MACK	Man.

MACK	Ah, ow.

SONG	I waited for you in the passenger seat ?

SONG	There's only so far I can ride in your dreams ?

SONG	While you were chasing everything else but me ?

SONG	I'm starting to break ?

SONG	Out from your brain ?

SONG	See I finally opened up my eyes ?

SONG	And saw me coming back to life ?

HENRY	Hey, this is Henry Meyer.

HENRY	Leave me a message.

MACK	Hey, just checking in.

MACK	Hope the case is going well.

MACK	I love you.

MACK	Hey guys, I'm here in gorgeous Clarksville.

MACK	I just wanted to do a little teaser

MACK	for the upcoming live taping.

MACK	Now I am in the midst of a deep dive

MACK	into the Blue Ribbon Killer.

MACK	The victims were all young women and all drowned.

MACK	Do you guys ever just have a day

MACK	where you feel a little crazy?

MACK	Like the truth should be one thing

MACK	but instead it's something completely different?

MACK	Really needed this love right now, guys.

MACK	Thank you, super excited to see all of you

MACK	at the live taping.

MACK	Well, a happy birthday to me.

HENRY	Boo!

MACK	Oh my god!

HENRY	Happy birthday.

HENRY	Oh, what, you thought I forgot?

MACK	Maybe.

HENRY	Happy birthday.

HENRY	Make a wish.

HENRY	Oh.

SONG	Do you think about me ?

SONG	When it's dark outside ?

SONG	Me when there's no upside ?

SONG	No prince or shining knight ?

LADIES	Cheese!

JUNE	So Oliver, how long have you been a cop?

OLIVER	I joined the force about eight years ago.

OLIVER	My father was a police officer

OLIVER	and his father and his father and his father. 

HENRY	Quite the alpha.

HENRY	I never knew.

OLIVER	If I can intervene in a crisis or right a wrong,

OLIVER	there's no higher calling.

OLIVER	But I don't serve in Clarksville.

OLIVER	My father's jurisdiction isn't far.

OLIVER	I mostly lived there after my parents split.

MACK	Hmm, it must have been hard.

MACK	My parents broke up when I was eight.

OLIVER	So June, how long have you been working

OLIVER	as a producer?

JUNE	I was actually in publishing full time

JUNE	until last year.

JUNE	And then the show started taking off.

MACK	June's creative direction

MACK	really made the show what it was.

JUNE	Oh, stop.

JUNE	I couldn't get this one to write her bestselling trilogy

JUNE	so this was the next best thing.

MACK	Well, why make anything up when

MACK	the real thing is better than the story?

OLIVER	Oh, let me help you with that.

MACK	Oh, no, no, no, we got it, sit.

OLIVER	Do you like to travel?

JUNE	Oh my god, I love it.

JUNE	Last year I went to Johannesburg, Austria,

JUNE	Costa Rica and Vietnam.

OLIVER	Wow.

OLIVER	The furthest I've been is across the border.

JUNE	It's not for everyone.

JUNE	I just get kind of antsy when I stay in one place

JUNE	for too long.

JUNE	You know what I mean?

OLIVER	I like it here.

OLIVER	Nice people, great place to raise a family.

JUNE	Oh, kids are definitely not in the cards for me.

JUNE	Zero maternal vibe.

OLIVER	I was thinking of getting a dog.

JUNE	I'm allergic.

JUNE	Mack, I was definitely thinking of a couple

JUNE	different ideas for our new,

HENRY	Hey.

HENRY	Never really thanked you for looking out for my mom and

HENRY	I know it meant a lot to her.

OLIVER	It was my pleasure.

OLIVER	She was a wonderful woman.

OLIVER	She was really proud of you.

OLIVER	I love what you've done with the place.

HENRY	Yeah.

HENRY	Yeah, I love this house.

HENRY	Pulled me back.

HENRY	I can't take the credit.

HENRY	It's all Mack.

MACK	Yes, thank you very much.

MACK	And, found a couple of gems.

JUNE	Oh my god, Mack, those are gorgeous.

JUNE	Are those from Henry?

MACK	Well, Henry gave me a great surprise this morning

MACK	but these are from Henry's mother.

JUNE	Aw, those are so cute.

JUNE	I mean it, you

HENRY	Take 'em off.

MACK	What, I...

HENRY	Mack, take 'em off, now!

MACK	You really embarrassed me tonight.

HENRY	I'm sorry.

HENRY	I just think don't think

HENRY	you should have put those earrings on.

MACK	They're not your mother's.

MACK	Whose are they?

MACK	Oh my god, are these Evelyn's?

HENRY	How many times do I have to tell you

HENRY	I am not sleeping with Evelyn?

MACK	Get out!

MACK	I don't even wanna be near you right now.

HENRY	Ah, you, I can explain.

HENRY	Just, I need time!

MACK	What does that even mean?

HENRY	Grr!

HENRY	Please, can we please stop?

HENRY	I have to be at court first thing.

MACK	You're unbelievable.

HENRY	You know, I'll sleep on the couch.

HENRY	Ugh.

MACK	What?

MACK	Hey.

MACK	Thanks again for coming the other night.

OLIVER	Sure.

OLIVER	It was fun.

MACK	Yeah.

MACK	So.

MACK	Where do you go so late at night?

OLIVER	How long have you been waiting to ask me that?

OLIVER	Get in, I'll show you.

MACK	Really?

OLIVER	Yeah.

SONG	Come with me ?

SONG	Let us go to a place they couldn't find yet ?

SONG	No one really mind it ?

MACK	You have the keys to the school?

OLIVER	Perks of being an officer of the law.

MACK	Wow.

OLIVER	I get permission to come up here

OLIVER	whenever I want.

OLIVER	Usually after a late swim,

OLIVER	this is my place to get away.

MACK	From what?

HENRY	All the noise.

HENRY	It's peaceful.

HENRY	Hang on.

MACK	Oh.

MACK	Oh, I can't.

OLIVER	Come on.

MACK	Well, Henry and I, we're trying to,

MACK	you know what, maybe just a splash.

OLIVER	Yeah?

MACK	Oh, oh that's enough.

MACK	Oh, it smells so good.

MACK	So, how are things going with June?

OLIVER	She's a great person

OLIVER	but she's not the one.

MACK	The one?

MACK	I didn't know you were such a romantic.

MACK	You really believe in that?

OLIVER	Of course.

OLIVER	None of us are perfect, let's be honest,

OLIVER	but there's someone out there that's perfect for us.

OLIVER	I bet you spent a lot of time alone as a kid

OLIVER	wondering if any of it was real.

OLIVER	It can be, Mack.

MACK	What is real anyway?

OLIVER	Trouble on the Meyer household?

MACK	This move.

MACK	It hasn't been easy.

MACK	But it's nice to have an outside ear.

MACK	Thank you for listening.

OLIVER	Anytime.

MACK	So, any leads on the broken window?

OLIVER	We think it could possibly be linked

OLIVER	to those messages that you're getting online.

OLIVER	Or just some kid.

MACK	Henry's not very popular around here.

OLIVER	Mack.

OLIVER	I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you.

OLIVER	If you need anything, you just let me know.

MACK	The first victim for a serial killer sets the pattern.

MACK	Often triggered by a very specific event,

MACK	a crime of passion.

MACK	When Dennis Rader, the BTK Strangler

MACK	resurfaced after more than a decade,

MACK	he followed the same pattern

MACK	which eventually led to his arrest.

MACK	Later crimes may be precise and Calculating

MACK	but always linked to the same passion

MACK	that started it all.

MACK	Like a first love?

MACK	Huh.

CHELSEA	Hi, Miss Brook

CHELSEA	Great, now the wife

MACK	I'm sorry?

CHELSEA	Henry?

CHELSEA	He just left.

MACK	What did he want?

CHELSEA	For me to stay away from you.

CHELSEA	Like I owe Henry Meyer a damn thing.

CHELSEA	But men just want what they want

CHELSEA	when they want it, right?

MACK	I better.

MACK	Oh, right.

MACK	I wanted to ask,

MACK	did Lily have any other boyfriends or suitors?

CHELSEA	Just Henry.

CHELSEA	But after you came by

CHELSEA	I did pull everything I had from back then.

CHELSEA	You're welcome to take a look for yourself.

CHELSEA	Maybe you coming here actually did help.

CHELSEA	And she can finally find some peace.

CHELSEA	You really remind me so much of her.

CHELSEA	That's from Henry.

MACK	"Lily, every time I read this I think of you.

MACK	Hither, hither, love."

MACK	Huh, that's not Henry's handwriting. What are these?

CHELSEA	Lily's favorite earrings.

CHELSEA	A gift from Henry, I think.

CHELSEA	She never took 'em off.

CHELSEA	That was one thing that always struck me as odd.

CHELSEA	She wasn't wearing them when they found her.

MACK	What, oh.

CHELSEA	Careful, please.

MACK	Do you mind if I take a picture of this?

CHELSEA	Be my guest.

MACK	Thank you so much.

MACK	I have to go.

CHELSEA	Argh!

CHELSEA	Ugh.

HENRY	What are you doing?

MACK	Henry.

MACK	What are you doing back?

HENRY	Came home early.

HENRY	Surprise.

HENRY	Listen.

HENRY	Now we can finally talk.

MACK	Where were you?

MACK	Just now?

HENRY	Nowhere.

HENRY	Mack, what's going on?

HENRY	What's in your hand?

HENRY	Mack, what is in your hand?

MACK	Why do you have Lily's earrings?

MACK	You were there when she died,

MACK	weren't you?

HENRY	How did you get

MACK	Did you kill Lily?

HENRY	Mack, do you hear yourself?!

HENRY	God, I mean your head,

HENRY	you go to these crazy dark places!

HENRY	I mean, like, how could you think that-

MACK	Why do you have these?

HENRY	You wanna talk about Lily?

HENRY	Fine!

HENRY	You know, I gave her those

HENRY	when we were together.

HENRY	And she gave them back the night of prom

HENRY	when she broke up with me.

MACK	And you kept them with you this whole

MACK	time?

HENRY	Yes!

HENRY	Because I feel responsible.

HENRY	You know, I don't like to talk about Lily, because,

HENRY	I was awful.

HENRY	Look what happened.

HENRY	You know, when she died,

HENRY	I hated myself!

HENRY	I went off to college.

HENRY	I even abandoned my mom because of it.

HENRY	But I don't wanna live like this.

HENRY	I want to start fresh with you.

MACK	How am I just learning all these major things

MACK	about your life?

MACK	I feel like I hardly know you.

HENRY	And then I do the exact same thing to you

HENRY	that I did to her.

MACK	Henry.

HENRY	I'm not the perfect husband, Mack.

HENRY	But I love you with all my heart.

HENRY	I just don't wanna lose you. (sobbing)

MACK	Good luck with the case.

HENRY	Thanks.

HENRY	See you in a couple days.

MACK	Ted Bundy's girlfriend.

MACK	What was she supposed to do?

MACK	I mean, he works late, and maybe

MACK	she discovered some weird things about him.

MACK	You know, but aren't we all a little weird?

MACK	I mean there's the car, the name,

MACK	and then the police sketch.

MACK	I mean now, there is real proof.

MACK	I mean she tells herself it's nothing

MACK	but you know, we see what we wanna see.

MACK	Before then it's just like, sure

MACK	maybe there's just some weird dead high school girlfriend

MACK	that you've never heard of

JUNE	Mack.

MACK	What?

JUNE	That last part didn't happen.

MACK	What do you mean?

JUNE	The dead ex-girlfriend part?

JUNE	That's Henry.

MACK	Sorry.

MACK	Let's just pick it up right before then.

JUNE	You know what, let's take a break.

MACK	Sorry.

MACK	I haven't been sleeping lately.

JUNE	Well you better rest up for the live taping.

MACK	Oh, right.

JUNE	Did you forget?

MACK	Remember those earrings I was wearing on my birthday?

JUNE	Henry's mother's?

MACK	Not exactly.

JUNE	Dude, what the

MACK	I know.

JUNE	Wasn't this the night Lily died?

MACK	He had an explanation, but

MACK	I know I caught him in a lie.

MACK	You know, for a moment, I thought

MACK	Henry could actually be...

JUNE	What?

MACK	The Blue Ribbon Killer.

JUNE	Mack, that is insane.

MACK	June.

MACK	What have we learned from the stories?

MACK	I mean, serial killers are charming.

MACK	They seem like good guys.

MACK	Think about it.

MACK	Lily threatens to break up with him.

MACK	Then he kills her in a crime of passion.

MACK	Then he goes on a rampage.

MACK	I mean the details of the murders

MACK	are the same as Lily's death.

MACK	I mean what if coming back here triggers him

MACK	and then it starts again?

MACK	Then I'm just the dumb wife

MACK	who didn't see it coming!

JUNE	Calm down.

JUNE	You are just overwhelmed

JUNE	with the move, the in vitro.

JUNE	And you have an internet stalker, for Christ sakes.

JUNE	But Henry did not kill Lily,

JUNE	and he most certainly is not

JUNE	the Blue Ribbon Killer, you just,

MACK	I just what?

JUNE	You just don't trust your husband.

JUNE	And you're twisting it into this,

JUNE	this impossible fantasy so you don't have to deal

JUNE	with what's really going on.

MACK	I'm just trying to be honest.

JUNE	Be honest with yourself!

JUNE	Did you really forgive Henry for sleeping with that girl?

MACK	What does that have to do with it?

JUNE	You guys moved back here

JUNE	to play happy family in the perfect house

JUNE	when you have rotten beams

JUNE	all up in your foundation.

JUNE	And while your work happens to be

JUNE	both of our meal tickets,

JUNE	you hide behind it just as much as you accuse Henry

JUNE	of hiding behind his.

JUNE	Try facing your problems instead of just

JUNE	covering them up with a baby!

JUNE	Sorry.

JUNE	That was,

JUNE	a little more brutal than

JUNE	brutal honesty required.

MACK	No, you're right.

MACK	I'm sorry.

MACK	I've been really self-absorbed lately.

JUNE	Don't worry.

JUNE	Tonight's gonna be great.

MACK	You sure about that?

JUNE	Buck up, cowgirl.

JUNE	Your public awaits.

MACK & JUNE	Au revoir, and watch your back.

WOMAN	Hi.

JUNE	Oh my god, I love your shirt.

GIRL	Thank you.

GIRL	I love "How I Met Your Murderer".

GIRL	My question is, how did you come up

GIRL	with your tagline?

MACK	Oh.

MACK	You know I just thought that au revoir

MACK	was just the coolest,

MACK	most crushing way to say goodbye.

MACK	You know, it has that certain je ne sais quoi.

MACK	And watch your back, well, it's just good advice.

GIRL	Is it true you're working on a story

GIRL	about the Blue Ribbon Killer?

MACK	Maybe.

GIRL	Oh, thank you!

KEVIN	My name's Kevin.

MACK	Hi, Kevin.

KEVIN	Hi, I love your work.

KEVIN	You spend so much time thinking

KEVIN	and discussing murders.

KEVIN	Are you able to sleep at night

KEVIN	or are you just up 24/7?

MACK	Oh, you know I try to focus on what's real.

MACK	You can't just let your mind

MACK	spiral out of control now, can you?

KEVIN	So when is your book coming out?

KEVIN	I would buy copies for my whole family.

MACK	Oh.

MACK	Yeah, well we've talked about a book.

MACK	I think maybe I'll get something in the work.

MACK	Too many happening.

JUNE	Thank you, Kevin.

KEVIN	Thanks so much.

MACK	Goodbye.

KEVIN	Thank you.

MACK	Bye.

JUNE	Thanks, Kevin.

REBECCA	Hi.

REBECCA	My name is Rebecca.

MACK	Hi, Rebecca.

REBECCA	I'm from Burlington.

REBECCA	I just wanted to say as a member of

REBECCA	this community my whole life

REBECCA	that I speak for myself and others

REBECCA	when I say that we don't appreciate you

REBECCA	prancing into our town

REBECCA	and making a mockery out of our tragic history.

REBECCA	Many of us are friends of,

REBECCA	or related to the victims

REBECCA	that you're using as entertainment.

MACK	Rebecca,

MACK	it was never my intention

REBECCA	You should be

REBECCA	ashamed of yourself.

JUNE	Okay, thank you so much for coming.

JUNE	That's all the time we have.

JUNE	Thank you so much.

OLIVER	That was

OLIVER	great

MACK	A total disaster?

OLIVER	No!

OLIVER	The fans love you.

OLIVER	Well, most of them.

OLIVER	Henry couldn't make it?

MACK	He's busy, you know.

TROY	Mack Meyer?

MACK	Yeah, that's me.

OLIVER	See?

OLIVER	Here, here, I'll put this in the car.

TROY	Thank you.

TROY	I'm Troy Kincaid.

MACK	Hey Troy, thanks for coming tonight.

TROY	You don't even recognize my name, do you?

MACK	Oh, I'm sorry, I don't.

MACK	Should I?

TROY	Neil Kincaid was my little brother.

TROY	He was a victim of a madman!

TROY	You just keep drudging it up.
TROY	Why can't you let him rest in peace?

MACK	Wait, you sent me those messages?

TROY	And the way you talked about him on your show?

MACK	Troy.

TROY	It's just cruel!

TROY	I read about you too, Mack Meyer.

TROY	Married to the Prom Queen Killer!

MACK	Troy, I am so sorry about your brother

MACK	but I can't change

OLIVER	Drop the knife.

OLIVER	Drop the knife, buddy.

OLIVER	Drop the knife and stay calm.

OLIVER	No one has to get hurt.

MACK	Oh my god!

MACK	No!

MACK	Oliver!

MACK	Stop!

OLIVER	Mack?

OLIVER	Stop!

MACK	Oliver!

MACK	Are you okay?

MACK	Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

OLIVER	No.

OLIVER	It's just a graze.

MACK	Oliver, if you hadn't been there.

OLIVER	But I was.
 
OLIVER	I told you, I won't let anything bad happen to you.

OLIVER	Hey.

OLIVER	You're gonna be okay.

MACK	I should be saying that to you.

MACK	We need to get you to a first aid kit.

OLIVER	Got one in my house.

OLIVER	Sure you're okay?

MACK	What?

MACK	Yeah, not a scratch.

OLIVER	You know what I mean.

SONG	Oh what's your soul sayin ?

SONG	Oh ?

SONG	Is your world changing ?

SONG	Oh ?

SONG	What's your soul sayin ?

SONG	Oh ?

OLIVER	Leaving?

MACK	Yeah.

MACK	Just a lot to do today.

OLIVER	Don't do that, don't pull away.

OLIVER	I'm right here.

MACK	Oliver.

MACK	I just need some time to think.

OLIVER	He's cheating on you.

MACK	Excuse me?

OLIVER	I followed Henry the other day.

OLIVER	He was with a blonde.

OLIVER	Think he called her Evelyn.

OLIVER	They were at a hotel.

MACK	I need to go.

OLIVER	Don't you believe me?

MACK	I don't know what to believe, Oliver.

MACK	I just need to go.

JUNE	Sorry, sorry about that.

JUNE	What were you saying?

HARVEY	Oh.

HARVEY	I was talking about how I'm fermenting my own pickles.

HARVEY	In a salt water and lactic acid brine.

HARVEY	But the part you really have to look out for though

HARVEY	is the CO2.

HARVEY	The whole thing could go boom!

JUNE	I'm sorry, can you excuse me for a moment?

HARVEY	Yeah, sure, yeah.

HARVEY	When you get back I'll talk to you about pickled succotash.

JUNE	Great!

HARVEY	You're gonna wanna hear it.

MACK	Oh no.

MACK	Cecilia Harkins.

MACK	Angelica Masters.

MACK	Brianna Park.

MACK	Dammit.

MACK	Come on, come on.

JUNE	Hey, it's June, you missed me.

OLIVER	Hey, you.

MACK	Where are you?

OLIVER	At the school, just went for a swim.

OLIVER	What's wrong?

OLIVER	Are you okay?

MACK	No.

MACK	I found something.

MACK	It's Henry, and I,

OLIVER	Come to the school, Mack.

OLIVER	Everything's gonna be okay.

MACK	Oh my god, Henry!

MACK	What are you doing here?

HENRY	I lied to you.

HENRY	 And I came back because this has to come out.

JUNE	Hey!

JUNE	I called the cops.

JUNE	I know where you work now, buddy, they're on the way.

TROY	Whoah, take it easy!

TROY	Oh, I recognize you from the other day.

JUNE	Yeah.

MAN	Look, you don't understand.

HENRY	I've been going back to the beginning.

MACK	I have to go, June's

HENRY	No!

HENRY	We can't run from this anymore.

HENRY	What is that?

MACK	I know what you did, Henry.

HENRY	Mack, listen to me.

MACK	Oh, phone, shoot!

HENRY	Mack!

HENRY	Mack!

HENRY	Mack, Mack!

HENRY	What are you doing?!

HENRY	oh my god, Oliver!

OLIVER	It's okay.

OLIVER	It's okay, I'm here.

JUNE	That guy you cut up, he's a police officer

JUNE	and that's a felony.

MAN	That guy?

MAN	He's not a cop.

JUNE	Save it for the judge.

MIKE	No, hey.

MIKE	Seriously.

MIKE	That guy paid me to attack that lady

MIKE	so he can jump in and save the day.

JUNE	You're not Troy Kincaid?

MIKE	Mike.

MIKE	Listen, your friend was never in any danger.

MIKE	I swear.

MIKE	It was all rehearsed.

MIKE	But if I were you,

MIKE	I would tell her to stay away from that guy.

MIKE	He's a weirdo,

MIKE	like there's seriously something wrong with him.

JUNE	Oh no.

MACK	It's Henry.

MACK	He killed Lily and all of those other women.

MACK	God, and how could I have been so stupid?

OLIVER	It's okay.

OLIVER	Hey this is Officer Turner.

OLIVER	We have a 1091 in progress.

OLIVER	Henry Meyer.

OLIVER	I'm at the high school.

OLIVER	Copy.

OLIVER	Okay, okay, squad cars are headed here and to your house.

OLIVER	It'll be okay, okay?

MACK	Mhmm.

OLIVER	I hate to say it,

OLIVER	you're right.

OLIVER	Henry's a plague to the women in his life.

OLIVER	Hey, breathe, you're safe now.

OLIVER	Does he know you're here?

MACK	No.

MACK	Wait, yes.

MACK	My cellphone.

MACK	I told June that I was coming here.

OLIVER	Stay here, okay?

OLIVER	Don't move.

MACK	What?

MAN	Is everything okay,

JUNE	No.

MAN	Clarksville Police Department.

JUNE	Hi, I need to talk to Officer Oliver Turner,

JUNE	it's an emergency.

Cop On Phone	Turner.

Cop On Phone	Do you know what department he works in?

JUNE	No, sorry.

JUNE	Wait, actually he's based in a different jurisdiction

JUNE	not far away.

Cop On Phone	We have records of the entire state

Cop On Phone	but there's no one by that name.

Cop On Phone	Would you like us to check the,

JUNE	Oh my god, Mack.

JUNE	Pick up, pick up.

MACK	Hey, it's Mack.

MACK	Leave me a message.

JUNE	Sorry, I have to go.

MACK	Hither, hither, love?

CHELSEA	That's from Henry.

CHELSEA	It doesn't look like his handwriting.

OLIVER	It's fine, I took care of him.

OLIVER	You're shaking.

MACK	What do you mean you took care of him, Oliver?

OLIVER	Henry's not a good person, Mack.

OLIVER	You're better off now.

OLIVER	You remind me so much of her.

MACK	Who?

OLIVER	Lily.

MACK	Oliver.

MACK	What did you do to Lily?

OLIVER	The curse of Henry Meyer! 

OLIVER	Even the most perfect girl,

OLIVER	a bad man can make ugly and cruel.

OLIVER	I just couldn't let that happen.

MACK	What about the others?

MACK	Cecilia, Angelica?

OLIVER	Brianna Park?

OLIVER	Why do so many men think

OLIVER	they can get away with whatever they want, Mack?

OLIVER	With no consequences?

OLIVER	And you're better off now, Mack.

OLIVER	Trust me.

OLIVER	He won't hurt

OLIVER	Mack!

OLIVER	You know we belong together, Mack!

OLIVER	I know you felt it last night!

OLIVER	Don't pretend it's not true.

MACK	No, no!

MACK	No, no, no, help, help!

LILY	How could you?!

LILY	It's over.

LILY	Just go, Henry.

LILY	Please, just go.

OLIVER	Lily.

LILY	Oliver?

OLIVER	You're too good for him.

OLIVER	This is our chance!

OLIVER	I know you felt it, Lily.

OLIVER	Don't pretend it's not true.

OLIVER	You loved that lying cheater

OLIVER	and you won't even give me a chance?!

LILY	Oliver, please, just stop!

LILY	Please!

LILY	Let me go!

OLIVER	Hello there.

OLIVER	You feeling okay?

OLIVER	They say it can cause some dehydration.

OLIVER	Lucky you, there's plenty of water.

MACK	Oliver, where am I?

MACK	Oliver!

OLIVER	Shh!

OLIVER	I'm sorry about this.

OLIVER	I have a surprise for you.

MACK	Oliver, wait!

MACK	Tell me your story.

MACK	About the girls.

OLIVER	Why drudge up the past?

MACK	This is what I do.

MACK	Please.

OLIVER	Remember the rooftop?
 
MACK	You talked about the one.

OLIVER	He's got good taste, I'll give him that.

OLIVER	These stupid girls cling on bad men.

OLIVER	By the time I got there, they were,

OLIVER	they were ruined.

MACK	So what, you killed them and framed Henry?

OLIVER	Oh, come on, Mack!

OLIVER	Don't pretend he's not guilty.

OLIVER	You saw it.

OLIVER	All you needed was a little nudge.

OLIVER	We see what we wanna see.

OLIVER	Isn't that right, Mack?

OLIVER	And now, for that surprise.

OLIVER	Here comes justice!

MACK	Henry!

OLIVER	Not such a big man now, are we?

OLIVER	How does it feel

OLIVER	knowing I can take anything from you?

MACK	Oliver, what are you doing?

OLIVER	Henry here's not worth you.

OLIVER	Or Lily, or any of them!

OLIVER	How does it feel, huh?

OLIVER	How does it feel

OLIVER	knowing everything you have I can have?

OLIVER	I could kill her right in front of you

OLIVER	if I wanted.

MACK	No.

MACK	Oliver, get away from me.

OLIVER	You didn't tell me to get away last night.

OLIVER	You hear that, big guy, huh?

OLIVER	She chose me. (laughing)

OLIVER	Come here, baby, mmmm.

OLIVER	We're only moments away from our happy ending, Lily.

MACK	That's not my name.

OLIVER	Shut up!

OLIVER	Shut up!

OLIVER	You don't even know what's good for you.

OLIVER	And you, this is long overdue!

OLIVER	Soon you're gonna thank me.

MACK	Oliver!

MACK	Get away from him.

OLIVER	Shut up!

OLIVER	Get back here, come here, come here!

OLIVER	Come here!

OLIVER	Got you!

MACK	Au revoir.

JUNE	Mack!

JUNE	Are you okay?

JUNE	I was so worried.

HENRY	Mack!

MACK	Henry.

MACK	I'm so glad you're okay.

HENRY	I know.

HENRY	I'm sorry.

HENRY	I'm so sorry.

JUNE	I think they need to get him in the ambulance.

HENRY	I love you.

MACK	I'm gonna need a lot of therapy

MACK	after this, aren't I?

JUNE	I'd say highly likely.

JUNE	Did you really meet a murderer?

JUNE	You know, that's just the name of the podcast, right?

JUNE	It's a joke, like

JUNE	you're not supposed to meet.

MACK	June, please.

MACK	In the end, the Blue Ribbon Killer

MACK	was revealed to be Oliver Turner.

MACK	A dark, twisted man who let his hate

MACK	and delusions consume him.

MACK	"He seemed so normal" is the common refrain.

MACK	But is that real

MACK	or is it just a blue ribbon?

MACK	The people who come into your life can change you.

MACK	But I think I speak for all of us when I say

MACK	I think this is one murderer

MACK	we wish we'd never met.

MACK	I really can't thank all of you enough

MACK	for your support.

MACK	This podcast saved me, literally.

MACK	And I guess, while the story is sensational,

MACK	what matters most are the people around you.

MACK	Do me a favor, hold them close

MACK	and don't let a little thing like murder

MACK	get between you.

MACK	As always, thanks for listening

MACK	to "How I Met Your Murderer".

MACK	I'm Mack Meyer, June Kim's our fearless producer.

MACK	 And a big thanks to our guest Henry Meyer

MACK	and resident Blue Ribbon Killer expert Andie McDougall.

MACK	And with that,

EVERYONE	Au revoir, and watch your back.

ANDIE	That was so cool!

HENRY	Maybe the best one yet?

MACK	You might be a little biased, superstar.

HENRY	This is my good side, get me from here.

JUNE	Well, I have got a long drive back to the city and,

JUNE	ooh, chocolate chip oatmeal raisin

JUNE	is gonna keep me company.

ANDIE	Thanks Mack.

ANDIE	Oh, and my mom wanted me to give you this.

ANDIE	I think her and the rest of the town

ANDIE	feel bad for being so mean to you guys.

HENRY	Oh, water under the bridge.

MACK	I'm just glad we get to be friends.

JUNE	Come on, kid, I'll drop you off.

MACK	June, were you just being maternal?

JUNE	What has this town done to me?

HENRY	I mean it was a great episode.

MACK	Quadrupled our listener base,

MACK	booked a national tour.

MACK	All it took was a run-in with a real live serial killer.

HENRY	Well, I mean they say relationships can get rough.

MACK	Really, that's what other couples have to deal with?

HENRY	In that case, consider us superheroes.

HENRY	But that means, I promise not to hide things

HENRY	and try to fix everything myself.

HENRY	Mack, look.

HENRY	If we have problems, Mack,

HENRY	we solve them together.

MACK	Deal.

MACK	And from now on, I'm gonna try making up the murders

MACK	instead of living 'em.

HENRY	What, you're gonna,

MACK	Try writing a book.

HENRY	And it's gonna be great.

HENRY	And maybe a good time to try IVF again?

MACK	Well, you know, I was thinking the same thing.

HENRY	Oh!

MACK	In the meantime,

MACK	maybe we could try doing it the old fashioned way?

HENRY	Yes, please.

MACK	I love you.

MACK	A lot.

HENRY	I love you too.
