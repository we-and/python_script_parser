MRS. BIRGERSON	Oh, my sweet child.

RUTH			I think I fell.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Be glad I came by, otherwise you would've been here for a long time.

MRS. BIRGERSON	When are you due?

RUTH			In two or three weeks.

MRS. BIRGERSON	That soon? You shouldn't be running around in the middle of the night, then.

RUTH			The choir needs more altos.

MRS. BIRGERSON	They also need new tenors, I heard, but I haven't signed up yet.

MRS. BIRGERSON	I'll take you home, nice and easy, and then we'll call Dr. Levin.

RUTH			That's not necessary, I think. Everything's fine.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Can you walk on your own?

RUTH			Yes.

MRS. BIRGERSON	My sweet child.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Arctander! Arctander!

MRS. BIRGERSON	Arctander, come here!

MR. BIRGERSON	Arctander!

MRS. BIRGERSON	Arctander!

GUSTAV		What has happened?

MRS. BIRGERSON	She fell on the mountainside..

GUSTAV		I'll take it from here. I'll take her.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Let's hope the doctor will be here soon.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Can you call and see if the telephone center has gotten hold of him?

MRS. BIRGERSON 	That's fine. Go. Go now.

MRS. BIRGERSON	There, there...

RUTH			I do so love Jesus.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Don't talk.

RUTH		I've been thinking of Him all evening. Do you think He will help me?

RUTH			He has to help me!

MRS. BIRGERSON	Easy now.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Take deep breaths.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Is Dr. Levin on his way?

GUSTAV		Yes.

MRS. BIRGERSON	You better call the telephone center again and ask when he will be here.

GUSTAV		You don't think we're about to lose her? That must not happen.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Go down and call.

GUSTAV		I can't lose her.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Of course not. Relax.

GUSTAV		You have to promise to do everything you can.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Please hurry!

MRS. BIRGERSON	There's a lot of blood.

FRU BIRGERSON	Godt, kom så. Alt, hvad du kan. Alt, hvad du kan.

MRS. BIRGERSON	That's good. As hard as you can, as hard as you can!

MRS. BIRGERSON	Ruth. Come on. Come on, Ruth. Come on. Yes, that's good.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Yes, that's good. More.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Pull yourself together! 

DR. LEVIN		It's just that I've never seen anything like this before.

MRS. BIRGERSON	No, but once in a while it happens.

MRS. BIRGERSON	We have to stop the bleeding. Careful.

MRS. BIRGERSON	We've lost her.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Abraham. We've lost her.

DR. LEVIN		No!

MRS. BIRGERSON	Abraham!

MRS. BIRGERSON	There, there...

DR. LEVIN		I'm sorry. I really did all I could.

DR. LEVIN		I'm so sorry.

DR. LEVIN		But your child is alive.

DR. LEVIN		I can understand that you're upset, but...

GUSTAV		Is it... alive?

GUSTAV		I mean, will it survive?

DR. LEVIN		Yes. It's... premature, but the vital signs are normal.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Just wait a few days, she will shed it.

GUSTAV		Take it away. That's not a child.

GUSTAV		It's a lynx.

MRS. BIRGERSON	My dear Gustav, I assure you...

GUSTAV		Take it away, I say.

GUSTAV		Monster.

GUSTAV		And I'm not your "dear Gustav". Or for anyone else around here.

DR. LEVIN		Do you need anything?

DR. LEVIN		Something to eat? A beer, perhaps?

GUSTAV		No.

DR. LEVIN		Is there anyone I should call? A friend? A relative?

GUSTAV		No.

GUSTAV		I don't have any family... that's still alive.

GUSTAV		They all die.

GUSTAV		It's just me now.

DR. LEVIN		When it comes to your newborn daughter,-

DR. LEVIN		the Birgersons have offered to care for your baby daughter, the first few days-

DR. LEVIN		if you like.

GUSTAV		Okay...

DR. LEVIN		So she's fed and cared for.

GUSTAV		Yes.

DR. LEVIN		Until you've...

DR. LEVIN		had time to deal with the practical side of things.

GUSTAV		Can you turn off the light on your way out?

GUSTAV		Let me help you, Miss.

RUTH			You don't have to salute me.

RUTH			Ruth Johansen, the new music educator.

GUSTAV		Stationmaster Arctander.

RUTH			A pleasure.

THE PRIEST		What are you going to name the child?

MRS. BIRGERSON	Gustav?

THE PRIEST		What are you going to name the child?

GUSTAV		I...don't know.

THE PRIEST		You don't know?

GUSTAV		No. You see, I...

GUSTAV		I've got so many other things to think about now.

THE PRIEST		Gustav, I really do need a name.

GUSTAV		Yes, I understand.

GUSTAV		Of course.

THE PRIEST		What about Ruth, after her mother?

GUSTAV		No, never!

GUSTAV		That won't work. It's too much.

DR. LEVIN		What about Eva?

MR. BIRGERSON	Abraham!

DR. LEVIN		It's true that it's a biblical name, the name of everybody's foremother.

DR. LEVIN		But if science is correct, everybody's foremother was,-

DR. LEVIN		several thousand years ago, not unlike this child.

THE PRIEST		Eva did not look like a monkey.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Excuse me, what are you saying?

MR. BIRGERSON	What, indeed?

GUSTAV		Eva?

GUSTAV		Eve might not be such a bad name.

GUSTAV		Eva.

THE PRIEST		Well, it is a good name, after all.

THE PRIEST		Eva...

THE PRIEST		I baptise thee in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

GUSTAV		We must hurry. They've come for Ruth.

CHURCHGOER		There's something strange about that baby, they say.

JAHNN			Swammerdamm. So, what do you make of it?

SWAMMERDAMM		Make of what?

JAHNN		Program with watermarked paper, banners and guards and... It's just odd.

SWAMMERDAMM		I suppose it's his way of showing it. His grief.

JAHNN		Maybe so. The stationmaster's grief. Do you really think so?

SWAMMERDAMM		We all have our way of coping.

JAHNN			Shall I tell you what I think? I'll tell you.

JAHNN			I think that this isn't a funeral, but a diversion.

JAHNN			That's what it is.

MRS. BIRGERSON	You're such a pretty little girl. You're such a pretty, pretty, little girl.

MRS. BIRGERSON	You are. Yes, you are.

MR. BIRGERSON	Good evening.

DR. LEVIN		Well...

MR. BIRGERSON	Well, Mrs. Birgerson asked me to tell you that your daughter is tucked up in a basket...

MR. BIRGERSON	...in our bedroom.

MR. BIRGERSON	Gustav... She's becoming attached to the child.

DR. LEVIN		Yes, and Mrs. Birgerson isn't getting any younger, so...

GUSTAV		Has it fallen out?

GUSTAV		Is there really nothing you can do?

DR. LEVIN		Unfortunately not. It's most unusual. We just have to hope that it falls off.

MR. BIRGERSON	Dr. Levin has found a wet-nurse.

DR. LEVIN		The girl is only 17 years old and is in quite a difficult situation.

DR. LEVIN		Her child died only three days old.

DR. LEVIN		The father of the child is not known, and her parents want nothing to do with her.

DR. LEVIN		They're Free Church, you see. She desperately needs this position.

HANNAH		It's so lovely here.

HANNAH		I've never had my own room before.

GUSTAV		Okay...

HANNAH		At home there're so many of us. There's not really enough space for it.

GUSTAV		If you need anything, you'll find me downstairs.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Good morning.

HANNAH		Hi.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Yes, this is little Eve.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Take good care of her.

MRS. BIRGERSON	I'll see you soon.

HANNAH		Yes?

SWAMMERDAMM		Yes... Uh...

SWAMMERDAMM		I... I was looking for the stationmaster. I just wanted to...

HANNAH		He's doing a line inspection, or something.

HANNAH		Do you want me to give him a message?

SWAMMERDAMM		No, that's fine.

SWAMMERDAMM		Uh... Cantor Swammerdamm.

SWAMMERDAMM		I'll come back another day.

JAHNN			Swammerdamm? You look flustered.

SWAMMERDAMM		Flustered?

JAHNN			You've been at the stationmaster's place, haven't you?

SWAMMERDAMM		Yes, I...

JAHNN		What has made you so flustered? You're not usually this jittery.

JAHNN			Has all the piano playing made you delicate?

SWAMMERDAMM		No, of course not.

JAHNN			What is it, Swammerdamm?

SWAMMERDAMM		You have no idea what I've just seen.

SWAMMERDAMM		I knocked on the stationmaster's door.

SWAMMERDAMM		... it, it, it ... Yes, it was a human child.

JAHNN			So it's true what people say?

JAHNN			She didn't have eyes like a snake, did she?

SWAMMERDAMM		Like a snake? No.

JAHNN			No fangs?

SWAMMERDAMM		No, no, no. Are you crazy?

JAHNN			I think Tidende has to write a few lines about this.

SWAMMERDAMM		What? No.

SWAMMERDAMM		No, no, I told you this in confidence. You can't write it in the newspaper.

JAHNN			Have a good evening, cantor.

SWAMMERDAMM		I'm begging you.

JAHNN			Have a good evening.

SWAMMERDAMM		I'm begging you as a friend.

JAHNN			After serious consideration, the editorial staff-

JAHNN		has found it necessary to put a damper on the speculations that have arisen recently.

INSERT		A STRANGE NATURAL EVENT

JAHNN			Gossip and rumors are, as we all know, a nuisance,-

JAHNN		and our newspaper is, like all serious journalistic organs,in opposition to that kind of unvirtuous activities.

JAHNN		However, occasionally certain private incidents might occur- that are of such a special nature- that the gossip itself calls for dutiful journalistic attention.

WOMAN 1		Have you seen it?

WOMAN 2		Like an animal?

WOMAN 3		Yes, full of hair on the body.

GUSTAV		The door must not be opened when you have the baby in your hands!

HANNAH		I'm sorry, stationmaster.

GUSTAV		I'm a civil servant of the Norwegian National Railways company and do not want any kind of menagerie here!

GUSTAV		She is not to go closer to the window than this! 

GUSTAV		Is that understood?

HANNAH		I understand.

GUSTAV		Furthermore, I do not under any circumstance want to see her downstairs in my office, in the telegraph office, or anywhere in the station building.

GUSTAV		And not on the platform either. Is that understood?

GUSTAV		They'll probably leave when they realize there's nothing to see.

GUSTAV		Have you noticed if anything has fallen out? On the pillow or other places?

HANNAH		No.

GUSTAV		Okay...

HANNAH		Mr. Stationmaster. It's not my place to say...

HANNAH		I mean, I've no right to suggest this, not at all, but...

GUSTAV		Continue.

HANNAH		Well, I was thinking about Eva.

HANNAH		I think it's a shame that she doesn't get any fresh air.

HANNAH		She's turning very pale.

HANNAH		She's not eating much, and she doesn't sleep well. And she's whimpering a lot.

HANNAH		So I was thinking that if I could take a stroll with her  down on Main Street or up to Fredheim each day.

GUSTAV		I'll think about it, Hannah. Good night.

GUSTAV		I've drawn a little map. This is the route you can take.

GUSTAV		The platform is empty of people at 10.15 AM. Then you can roll her to the end of the platform.

GUSTAV		From there you can go over the railway crossing to this empty lot.

GUSTAV		There you'll find a small path, partially covered by a board, that leads to this engine shed.

GUSTAV		By the engine shed there's a sunny wall with a small bench. You can sit there awhile.

GUSTAV		If no one comes, of course.

GUSTAV		If you want to be outside for an hour, until after 11.15 AM, you can walk the same way back.

GUSTAV		But if you want to be outside for a shorter while, you have to walk around the whole town.

GUSTAV		Then there'll be no time to stop for anything.

GUSTAV		Anything other than this is strictly forbidden.

HANNAH		She laughed today.

HANNAH		Don't you want to hold her a little bit?

GUSTAV		No, it's better if you take care of that.

GUSTAV		It's too late today, but tomorrow...

GUSTAV		Does Hannah have a watch?

DR. LEVIN		Gustav! A letter! From the Board of Health.

GUSTAV		Oh, so they know about this in the capital as well?

DR. LEVIN		Yes. I simply had to report it.

DR. LEVIN		Otherwise I'd be in trouble myself. Read it! Read it.

GUSTAV		"This is such a rare condition that only a handful of known cases... in the last 400 years..."

GUSTAV		"Your letter has therefore excited a great deal of interest..."

GUSTAV 		They're coming here!

DR. LEVIN		Yes, they are.

DR. LEVIN		Dr. Stroem?

DR. STROEM		Yes.

DR. LEVIN		Dr. Levin.

DR. STROEM		I'd like my baggage brought down.

GUSTAV		Stationmaster Arctander. I am the child's father. It's this way.

DR. STROEM		Fantastic. Incredible!

HANNAH		She's smiling and making the same sounds as other children.

HANNAH		As far as I know.

DR. LEVIN		Have you seen this before?

DR. STROEM		No, never. Never. It's unique.

DR. STROEM		I've seen cases where it has been found on certain parts of the body.

GUSTAV		What is wrong with her?

DR. STROEM		There's nothing wrong. Nothing.

DR. STROEM		All of us have hair follicles on our bodies, Arctander.

DR. STROEM		Before the seventh month in the development of the fetus, the hair follicles all over the body,- and all of them at once, produce a significant hair growth.

DR. STROEM		As if the organism is making sure they're all in working order.

DR. STROEM		Then... in the seventh month, the fetus sheds them all.

DR. STROEM		But your little girl, on the other hand, has... The hairs have just kept on...

DR. STROEM		...growing and growing and growing.

GUSTAV		I see. So she has simply just kept them?

DR. STROEM		Yes, indeed. Yes.

GUSTAV		But what can we do to make them disappear faster?

DR. STROEM		We can't do anything.

DR. STROEM		But you must not... You must not shave her.

DR. STROEM		The hairs will grow back, and eventually they'll become beard stubble.

DR. STROEM		We have to maintain the connection, Arctander.

DR. STROEM		And if you... Levin, was it?

DR. LEVIN		Yes.

DR. STROEM		If you can provide ongoing reports?

DR. STROEM	 	And I need the camera.
	
GUSTAV		But all those hairs, when do they disappear?

DR. STROEM		They'll never disappear.

DR. STROEM		What a rarity. A curiosity.

DR. STROEM		Yes. I'll take a picture, if you don't mind.

EVA			I know that I don't look like you.

EVA			Neither the eyes or anything else.

EVA		When I look at myself in the mirror, I see something that doesn't look like anything.

EVA			I know it very well.

EVA			Other people have faces, but I don't.

GUSTAV		Eva, maybe we should let the picture hang where it's supposed to?

GUSTAV		It's not a good picture.

GUSTAV		She didn't really look like that.

HILD			Look! Look!

EVA			No! No, no!

EVA			No!

GUSTAV		Look at me! Now you have to sit in here until you decide to do what I say.

EVA			No!

GUSTAV		Go inside!

EVA			8 + 8 + 8 = 24

EVA			5 x 5 = 25

EVA			6 ÷ 6 = 1

EVA			1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

GUSTAV		Wow, look at that! It'll be the prettiest tree we've ever had.

HANNAH		It reminds me of the Christmas tree parties in Fredheim when I was a kid.

EVA			What's a Christmas tree party?

HANNAH		Don't you know that?

EVA			A party for the Christmas tree, perhaps?

HANNAH		The Christmas tree party was the greatest day of the whole year. Even greater than Christmas Eve.

HANNAH		It was in January. We were saying goodbye to the tree, sort of.

HANNAH		It was three times as big as this. And it was so beautifully decorated.

EVA			Did it have baubles?

HANNAH		Gold baubles.

EVA			Real gold?

GUSTAV		Maybe we should get the decorating done instead?

HANNAH		And I was wearing my most beautiful dress. It was red all over, with blue velvet ribbons.

HANNAH		And my mom had put silver buckles on my shoes. They sparkled just like the tree.

EVA			Did you look like a princess?

HANNAH		I do believe I did. I was so lovely.

HANNAH		And then we danced around the Christmas tree, and afterwards the magician came.

HANNAH		That was what everybody was looking most forward to.

GUSTAV		Hannah.

HANNAH		He made flowers appear out of thin air. And feathers and...

GUSTAV		Hannah!

GUSTAV		Isn't there something missing up there?

GUSTAV		Eva?

GUSTAV		I'll be back in a little while.

EVA			Okay.
GUSTAV		In forty minutes at the most.

EVA			At night I dream of you.

EVA			Sometimes. Not often.

EVA			You're more beautiful than in the picture.

EVA			And your eyes are so brown.

EVA			Your voice is soft and warm.

EVA			You're smiling and saying things to me.

EVA			Things I don't remember when I wake up.

EVA			Yet I love those dreams.

EVA			Once I dreamt that you had hair in your face.

EVA			And that I didn't.

EVA			But when I woke up, everything was the same as before.

EVA			I wish that it wasn't like that.

EVA			How long is Hannah staying with her family?

GUSTAV		Hannah? Until the third day of Christmas.

GUSTAV		Aren't you excited about opening your Christmas gifts later?

EVA			Can't we please go to the Christmas tree party, dad?

GUSTAV		No. Those things are not for us.

EVA			But Hannah said that it was for everybody.

GUSTAV		"Hannah"! "Hannah said..."

GUSTAV		She's putting a lot of ideas into your head.

GUSTAV		Eva...

GUSTAV		...I've told you how people can behave.

EVA			Yes. Never mind.

GUSTAV		Good night.

EVA			Good night.

EVA			Did you have a Christmas tree before I was born?

GUSTAV		Of course we did. You know that.

GUSTAV		It was your mother who made the angels, the stars and all the other things that are hanging on the tree.

EVA		Did she think about me, do you think? When she made the decorations?

GUSTAV		About you?

GUSTAV		No, I don't think she did that.

GUSTAV		No, I need a shoe that's more closed off.

GUSTAV		I mean, something like that.

GUSTAV		Yes.

EVA			Thank you so much!

GUSTAV		Say thank you to Hannah, too.

EVA			Thank you.

HANNAH		You can borrow this for the evening.

HANNAH		I wore it when I was a little girl.

GUSTAV		Are you ready?

HANNAH		You look like a princess.

HANNAH		Look how it glitters, Eva.

ARVID			Is it hot?

ARVID			That's what I thought.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Hi! Hi.

MRS. BIRGERSON	You look so pretty.

MRS. BIRGERSON	And you've got new boots.

EVA			Dad bought the silver buckles.

MRS. BIRGERSON	And what a pretty dress you're wearing. Now you'll have some cake.

EVA			Yes.

MAGICIAN		Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls!

MAGICIAN		Welcome to this little moment of magic, sorcery and miracles.

MAGICIAN		Are you prepared to see things that you until now have never seen before?

CHILDREN 		Yes!

MAGICIAN		Let us see if our invisible hen-

MAGICIAN		can lay some eggs for us.

CHILDREN 		Me! Me! Me! Pick me! ....

MAGICIAN		Can you say "cluck, cluck" into the bag?

ARVID			Cluck, cluck.

MAGICIAN		How about you, dear? Good God!

MAGICIAN		That is...that is quite a wonderful Yule goat mask you're wearing, my dear.

BOY			That's no mask. That's how she looks!

MAGICIAN		Oh, I see. Then it's the Yule goat itself, I suppose.

MAGICIAN		Can the Yule goat talk?

EVA			Cluck, cluck.

GUEST 		Good doggie!

EVA			That's not an egg. It's a stone!

GUSTAV		What did I tell you? We're leaving.

GUSTAV		What's wrong? What is it?

GUSTAV		Stop! What are you doing? That's no way to behave!

EVA			Can you draw me, dad?

EVA			You're so good.

GUSTAV		Thank you.

EVA			Please.

GUSTAV		Some other time. What are you doing?

EVA			Tomorrow?

HANNAH		Come.

SPARKY		Well, hello there.

HANNAH		There's someone here who wants to give you something.

SPARKY		Oh yeah? Wow, that's nice. Thank you very much.

EVA			You're welcome.

EVA			Why do they call you Sparky?

SPARKY		Probably because they think my hair looks like sparks. Whoops, look at this.

HANNAH		We have to let Sparky get back to work, Eva.

SPARKY		No, no, no. Come here. It's starting to get exciting. Come on.

SPARKY		Come here and take a look. It's Karolius who's writing.

SPARKY		Should I answer him and say that I've got a visit from two young and pretty ladies?

SPARKY		"You're bragging as always. I'm sure it's just some old hens."

SPARKY		Wasn't that rude? Shall we write back to him?		

SPARKY		Come on, you can join me. There we go.

SPARKY		What should we say? That he's an old fox? Should we do that?

SPARKY		Now we're writing that.

SPARKY		Do you know the letters?

SPARKY		Look. We'll take this. And then you see... We call the spots "dits".

SPARKY		And we call the lines "dahs".

SPARKY		It's just short and long thrusts. Dit and dah. Dit and dah.

HANNAH		Down. Down. Duck down, Eva.	Hurry up, hide!

HANNAH		Hurry and hide!

SPARKY		Yes. Hi.

EVA		The Pacific Ocean. It connects with the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait.

EVA			The size...is described 100 years...

HANNAH		Hm...

HANNAH		There's a letter for you.

EVA			For me?

HANNAH		I believe so, yes.

EVA		"Dear Eva, you did so good the other day that I thought you would enjoy this."

EVA		"Sincerely yours, your friend Sparky."

HANNAH		Look.

HANNAH		It's the whole Morse alphabet.

EVA			It says "your friend Sparky".

MRS. BIRGERSON	The revolution had to happen.

MRS. BIRGERSON	The Russian people have...have lived like animals. They have starved for hundreds of years.

GUSTAV		But my sweet Elsa! Is that any way to take responsibility?

GUSTAV		To topple the social organization, take the law into your own hands and kill your opponents?

GUSTAV		It only creates total chaos.

GUSTAV		I've heard that the trains are not even running down there. There's not a single train that's on schedule.

MRS. BIRGERSON	"On schedule," Gustav?

MRS. BIRGERSON	The Russian people have been a patriotic myth, but now they've risen and become a terrifying reality.

MRS. BIRGERSON	And Trotsky predicted this.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Trotsky is the man for the future. Mark my words. Trotsky is the man for the future.

GUSTAV		Well, I never...

GUSTAV		Well, I never...

EVA			I want to be a telegraph operator.

GUSTAV		What did you say?

EVA			A lot of women are telegraph operators. Sparky said so.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Yes, why not, Gustav?

MRS. BIRGERSON	Thank you. See you later.

GUSTAV		The pleasure is mine.

GUSTAV		You've been down in the telegraph office without my permission! Don't ever go down there again, you hear?!

HANNAH		She needs to meet people.

GUSTAV		I'll be the judge of that, not you.

HANNAH		She can't be alone all the time! It's not healthy!

GUSTAV		She's not lonely. She has us.

HANNAH		But she's a child, Arctander.

HANNAH		She needs to be with children her own age.

HANNAH		Can't you please let her attend school?

GUSTAV		Have you already forgotten what happened at the Christmas party? Huh?

GUSTAV		Do you think we should continue to expose ourselves to such things?

GUSTAV		That's all for today, Hannah.

RUTH			Gustav, can you give me my comb?

EVA			Are you going to draw afterwards, dad?

GUSTAV		Mmm. Maybe so.

EVA			What are you going to draw?

GUSTAV		It's a new train model that I'm trying to get the hang of.

GUSTAV		An ore train.

EVA			Where's Hannah?

GUSTAV		I don't know.

EVA			When is she coming back?

GUSTAV		I don't know.

EVA			Who's going to take care of me if Hannah isn't doing it?

GUSTAV		I don't know! Will you stop asking questions all the time?

GUSTAV		What are you doing?

EVA		I thought I could go get Hannah if I didn't have any hair.

GUSTAV		What is this foolishness?! Do you want a beard all over your body?!

GUSTAV		And this... Don't touch this. It's mine. Do you understand? Do you understand?!

GUSTAV		Wipe it off now.

GUSTAV		Foolishness.

GUSTAV		Okay, I'll...I'll get straight to the point.

GUSTAV		Hannah is very much missed at home.

GUSTAV		I would like to listen to the demands Hannah has to return.

EVA			Is it mine?

SPARKY		Yes.

SPARKY		It's connected to the telegraph downstairs. That way, you and I can talk to each other.

SPARKY		Should we try it now? Do you want to? You sit here, and I'll run downstairs.

GUSTAV		Well, I never...

GUSTAV		Welcome back.

SPARKY		Sparky to Eva. Pay attention to the 2.30 PM train. There's a real Negro on board!

SPARKY		And on the 3.45 PM train, there's a merry-go-round!

EVA			Eva calling Sparky.

EVA		Is it legal that Dr. Levin and dad decide that I will never attend school?

DR. LEVIN		But my dear Hannah, I can't go against Arctander's decision.

DR. LEVIN		He's the father of the child. And I have to say that I agree with him.

HANNAH		But she needs to learn things at the same rate as other children, together with other children.

HANNAH		The school board...

DR. LEVIN		I'll deal with the school board.

DR. LEVIN		A physician's word is law, you know.

HANNAH		It must be lovely to be in that position, of course.

HANNAH		Well, what do I know...

HANNAH		But since I now live at a railway station,-

HANNAH		I've noticed that they distribute letters regarding legislation there.

HANNAH		To the county magistrate and vicar.

DR. LEVIN		You shouldn't get too involved in this.

HANNAH		Well, I don't know. I've only completed elementary school.

HANNAH		I was just thinking that when I was a kid and someone was forced to stay at home, the magistrate came calling.

HANNAH		So I was just wondering what Arctander and the doctor would've done then?

HANNAH		We're off to school.

EVA		Do you think the other children have learned a lot about Mesopotamian history?

GUSTAV		Mmm. Perhaps.

HANNAH		Come.

MISS HADELAND	Okay, today we are going to learn the letter "i".

MISS HADELAND	Does anybody know a word that starts with "i"? Yes?

BOY IN CLASS	"Ice".

MISS HADELAND	"Ice". Good.

GIRL 1		Take her knapsack.

BOY 1			Flea trap!

BOY 2			Get her!

GIRL 2		Tear out her hair!

BOY 3			Tear out her hair!

CHILDREN		Yes!

GUSTAV		How did it go at school today?

EVA			It went well.

EVA			Very well.
	
MISS HADELAND	Kjersti Borgli?

KJERSTI		Here.

MISS HADELAND	Kristine Gulbrandsen?

GUSTAV		You're late.

EVA			Yes.

GUSTAV		Speaking of which, I got a letter from miss Hadeland.

GUSTAV		She says you've been away from school a lot lately.

GUSTAV		She was worried about your absence, and so am I.

GUSTAV		Is it possible to get an explanation?

EVA			Miss Hadeland, maybe?

GUSTAV		There has also come an inquiry from professor Stroem-

GUSTAV		regarding a dermatology conference in Copenhagen next month.

GUSTAV		There will be doctors and scientists from all over the world there, and we're invited to participate.

EVA			Are we going?

GUSTAV		Yes. Maybe it's not such a bad idea to get away from here for a little while.

EVA			Maybe they'll invent a cure for me.

MRS. BIRGERSON	Have a really nice trip. Take care of yourself.

MR. BIRGERSON	Have a nice trip, Eva.

EVA			Thank you.

SPARKY		Have a nice trip.

HANNAH		A little something for your journey.

EVA			Did you get a new pocket watch, dad?

GUSTAV		Well, I don't know if it's that new. A little bit, perhaps.

EVA			It's so beautiful.

GUSTAV		Well, we have to look our best when we're going on a long trip. What do you say?

GUSTAV		I thought we might eat dinner in the dining car tonight.

EVA		But Ha...Hannah packed a basket with food. We don't have to go be where there are other people.

GUSTAV		I think we've eaten enough of Hannah's food, huh?

GUSTAV		Come, let's go!

HEAD WAITER		Good evening.

GUSTAV		Good evening. Arctander is my name.

GUSTAV		Hello?

HEAD WAITER		Yes.

GUSTAV		We've made a reservation.

HEAD WAITER		Of course.

HEAD WAITER		Yes, uh... Arctander. That's right. This way.

HEAD WAITER		The menu.

GUSTAV		Thank you very much.

GUSTAV		What is there to consider? We're having the best. Head waiter!

GUSTAV		Let's see... We'll start with two orders of the soup of the day. And then the roast. That should be it for now.

GUSTAV		But this is just to get started. So don't wander off.

HEAD WAITER		Thank you.

GUSTAV		Also, a glass of apple cider for my daughter...

GUSTAV		...and half a bottle of Bordeaux for me.

HEAD WAITER		Thank you.

EVA			Don't mind them.

GUSTAV		Well then, so we wound up on a trip together, you and I.

GUSTAV		A really long trip, abroad.

GUSTAV		Miss and Mister stationmaster Arctander.

EVA			Cheers.

GUSTAV		Have I told you that I've already been to Copenhagen once?

EVA			No.

GUSTAV		Then too I was in the company of a young lady.

GUSTAV		This was a long time before I met your mother, so...

GUSTAV		She and I strolled along the most beautiful promenade I've ever seen.

GUSTAV		And I would like to do that one more time.

EVA		Maybe I sense something I yet do not know. That long trips have such an effect on human beings.

EVA			The minute trains or ships are in motion,-

EVA			it's as if life as they know it lets go of them.

EVA			And they are filled with life as it ought to be.

EVA		They turn for a moment into the person they should've been.

EVA			The one they could've been.

EVA			They are free-

EVA		and will gladly order another bottle of Bordeaux, in addition to a wonderful bowl of ice cream for their daughter.

JOURNALIST 1	Miss Arctander.

JOURNALIST 2	Look this way.

JOURNALIST 3	Miss Arctander, is it possible to get a short interview after the convention?

DR. STROEM		It's only two nights.

JOURNALIST 2	Excuse me, Miss Arctander. This way. Look. Look this way.

FJOURNALIST 1	Miss Arctander, how long are you staying in this country?

EVA			I'm sure it will go well, dad.

GUSTAV		Take good care of her!

JOURNALIST 3	Is there any hope for a cure? Mr. Stroem.

JOURNALIST 3	Professor Stroem, is there any hope for a cure for Miss Arctander?

JOURNALIST 2	Miss Arctander? Can you look this way?

JOURNALIST 3	Miss Arctander, look my way once more. Thank you. I want to take a picture.

JOURNALIST 2	Thank you. That's good.

FJOURNALIST 2	Is it possible to get an interview after the convention?

JOURNALIST 4	Excuse me, Miss Arctander, can we take another picture?

ANDREJ		Good evening, young lady.

ANDREJ		I assume we're delegates at the same convention.

ANDREJ		Andrej Bor, at your service.

ANDREJ		But you may call me Andreas if you like.

EVA			Eva Arctander.

ANDREJ		Now that we're acquainted... would you like to join me, Miss Eve?

ANDREJ		So we can have a little chat.

ANDREJ		You are of course this convention's absolute highlight.

ANDREJ		You'll have to excuse me if I startled you.

ANDREJ		I'm often awake at night because my skin hurts

ANDREJ		My misfortune. 

ANDREJ		Are you in pain, Miss Highlight?

EVA			No, it's not painful.

ANDREJ		Lucky for you.

ANDREJ		You've met professor Joachim, I presume?

EVA			Uh... Is he a doctor?

ANDREJ		That is funny.

ANDREJ		Nein, nein, he is director of a travelling troupe.

ANDREJ		He's got a whole menagerie of people of our kind.

ANDREJ		Lilliput humans and Siamese twins, fat ladies and strong men.

ANDREJ		A man with two heads, and a lizard man.

ANDREJ		That's me.

ANDREJ		His troupe is very successful. It's famous in all of Europe.

ANDREJ		Perhaps you think you are lonely?

ANDREJ		Because no one else is like you.

ANDREJ		In a troupe like professor Joachim's, you will never be lonely.

ANDREJ		Because there will always be so many others that are in a similar situation as yours.

ANDREJ		You will feel quite normal.

ANDREJ		And you might find happiness, for I will say this to you... Cheers.

ANDREJ		Among us peculiar people, there are a lot of happy marriages.

ANDREJ		You are quite, quite hideous. You will never be cured.

ANDREJ		And you will never win the heart of a normal man.

ANDREJ		No man that can give you what you dream of.

ANDREJ		Not out there in their world.

ANDREJ		But in our world, you can experience happiness.

ANDREJ		You can be desired and loved.

ANDREJ		And you could desire and love in return.

ANDREJ		You can't ask more of life than the essential preconditions allow.

ANDREJ		That's a lesson that most people learn too late.

ANDREJ		But we learn it early.

ANDREJ		Let's drink to that.

ANDREJ		I'm sorry...

DR. STROEM		You're freezing, my dear.

DR. STROEM		Isn't that right?

DR. STROEM		Now you will get a good night's sleep. Won't you?

DR. STROEM		And then tomorrow morning, you'll have a nice breakfast, yes?

DR. STROEM		And only because an ambiguity of the gender or other distorting or pathological physical traits are seen at the same time.

DR. STROEM		Okay...

DR. STROEM		You feel much better now, don't you?

GUSTAV		I got the message. What has happened? It's not serious, is it?

DR. STROEM		No, no, she fainted, that's all. But she's much better now.

DR. STROEM		It may have been the long train journey and strange surroundings.

DR. STROEM		But we're about to start again soon, aren't we?

EVA			I'm so tired.

DR. STROEM		Yes, but everything has gone according to schedule. 				That might be the reason she's tired.

GUSTAV		Come with me.

GUSTAV		We're putting a stop to this right now. 

DR. STROEM		But why? It will be a great pity for the conference if we can't continue.

GUSTAV		What happened at the hospital, Eva?

EVA			Nothing.

HANNAH		Hi! How was your trip?

SPARKY		Hi, Eva.

KNUDZON		There is something odd about the entries in these books, Arctander.

KNUDZON		What do you have to say about it?

GUSTAV		What could it be ..?

GUSTAV		Oh, well...

GUSTAV		Just give me some time, Knudzon, and I'll find a solution to this.

KNUDZON		Okay, you have until August. But then I have to report this.

KNUDZON		After all, they want to hold someone responsible for this.

MISS HADELAND	Kristian Guttormsen?

KRISTIAN		Present.

MISS HADELAND	Arvid Hansen?

MISS HADELAND	Arvid Hansen?

ARVID			So this is where you disappear to?

ARVID			Shouldn't I have come here?

EVA			No.

ARVID			Oh, well...

ARVID			A drop of coffee is going to taste good now.

EVA			I don't drink coffee.

ARVID			I've been drinking coffee all my life.

EVA			My dad says it's not good for children.

ARVID			You're not a child.

ARVID			It's best with plenty of sugar candy.

ARVID			Good?

EVA			Very.

ARVID			Do you go swimming here?

EVA			It's too cold.

ARVID			Come on in! It's hardly cold at all.

ARVID			You might've told me that you couldn't swim.

EVA			I thought I could now.

ARVID			You're funny...

ARVID			But in a nice way.

GUSTAV		As you probably know, the auditors are here because some money has disappeared.

GUSTAV		But we can surely come to an amicable arrangement.

SPARKY		You mean... Are you putting the blame on me?

GUSTAV		I would like to come to an amicable arrangement, yes.

GUSTAV		Melvig! Melvig, Melvig. Sit down.

GUSTAV		I know you're fond of Eve.

GUSTAV		She needs her home.

GUSTAV		Where else would she live? At least she can telegraph here.

SPARKY		Eva doesn't want to be a telegraph operator anymore.

SPARKY		She wants to study mathematics. To do that, she needs to go to the capital.

SPARKY		She's much too gifted to sit in the telegraph office.

GUSTAV		A university education with an exam is something I could never pay for.

GUSTAV		Besides, I doubt any university would accept her.

GUSTAV		And where would she live?

GUSTAV		Melvig...

GUSTAV		...she needs her home.

GUSTAV		For Eva's sake.

ARVID			I just don't get it.

EVA		Look... If the diameter of a circle is 1, the circumference is 3.14.

ARVID			Always?

EVA			Always.

EVA			In America they tried to pass a law to round Pi up to 4.

EVA		Then, no bridge would remain standing. Luckily there was a professor present.

EVA			You're so smooth.

ARVID			I think you're pretty.

ARVID			Can I skive off with you again some other time?

ARVID			Can I?

EVA			Arvid. Bye-bye.

DR. LEVIN		You're exhausted, Gustav. Nothing serious, but you need to rest.

DR. LEVIN		I'm going to write a referral to a health resort that has shown good results.

DR. LEVIN		Eva can also come.

EVA			To a health resort?

EVA			What did Knudzon talk about before we left, dad?

EVA			He seemed so serious.

GUSTAV		No, no, it was nothing.

GUSTAV		Knudzon and I have been friends a long time. If there's a problem, we sort it out between us.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	I didn't mean to disturb you, but I don't have anything to do all day while my husband gets his treatments.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	So I come down here to paint autogamy flowers.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	By the way, it's proper for the younger to introduce herself to the older first.

EVA			Eva Arctander.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	My name is also Eva. Eva Grjothornet.

EVA			I think you're pretty.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	Do you really think I'm pretty?

EVA			You're the prettiest.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	It's no picnic to stay pretty.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	In the autumn, it is I who go to health resorts.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	These days I go to Dr. Lebedew Kumatsch for his snail-bath treatment.

EVA			Snail treatment?

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	This Bulgarian doctor has discovered-

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	that the Anatolian fig leaf snail produces a secretion that is very vitalizing for the skin and dermis. The treatment consists of the patient being undressed and then rubbed with a balsam consisting of ground leaves and bark, crating a thin, even layer. The snails eat by means of a tongue located beneath their tube feet. And the tongue is full of small, sharp teeth that remove dead skin cells and blemishes. After a little while, they start to produce their vitalizing secretion again and again. I have of course tried a number of other treatments. From bathing in lamb's blood to the usual electric baths and ionization chambers. I've even bathed in whale secretion. That...was no fun.

EVA			Do you think I could ever get an ordinary man?

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	But you have a boyfriend. Don't you?

EVA			He's beautiful... like you.

EVA		I think I ought to have a conversation going when I'm with him but when I told him that Norway's first female doctor went to Paris to meet Einstein and Marie Curie, he wasn't very interested. If only I had been as pretty as you.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	You believe when you're young, as I did, that beauty is life itself.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	It's the goal and meaning of everything. Everything strives for it, everything seeks it.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	But what is beauty really?

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	Now it's slowly disappearing, even for me.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	In spite of snails and treatments.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	So you should not be sad, but observant.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	For you have a quite different and much freer starting point.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	Promise me that you'll use it wisely.

EVA			My dad's been called home ahead of time.

EVA		There seems to be a serious matter at home at the station.

EVA			So we're leaving shortly.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	It's been lovely to get to know you.

EVA			Likewise.

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	You have a long journey ahead of you.

EVA			Do you think so?

MRS. GRJOTHORNET	Little friend. Bon voyage!

EVA			Sparky! Arvid has...

EVA			Dad!

EVA			Hannah! Where's Sparky?

EVA			Hannah!

EVA			Are you leaving, Sparky? Wait!

EVA			You have to stop this! You can't let him leave!

GUSTAV		Can you pass the salt, please?

EVA		Sparky's standing outside on the platform waiting for the train!

EVA			You can't pin the blame on him!

GUSTAV		I'm not pinning the blame on him. He chose to leave.

EVA			And why did he resign voluntarily?

GUSTAV		Don't take that tone, young lady. Please.

GUSTAV		The auditors did an internal audit.

GUSTAV		Various sums of the government's money have disappeared, as you probably know. Can you pass the salt, Hannah?

EVA			-And?

GUSTAV		And?

GUSTAV		He laid his cards on the table, and then he took the blame.

GUSTAV		Knudzon and I have put in a good word for him, so the case was settled in a good way.

EVA			But he loses his job.

GUSTAV		He loses his job, yes.

GUSTAV		But that was part of our agreement.

GUSTAV		That way, we avoided to go to trial with this. That would've been terribly sad.

EVA			For you and the station.

GUSTAV		For everyone. And especially for you.

GUSTAV		Eva.

GUSTAV		I realize this isn't easy for you.

GUSTAV		He was a good friend, and you liked him a lot. And he was kind to you. I know that.

GUSTAV		But you have to try to...

EVA			Try to do what?

GUSTAV		Well, you have to try to look at it in a philosophical manner.

EVA			Philosophical? That's a great idea.

GUSTAV		Don't take that tone with me, as I said before.

GUSTAV		Irony doesn't help.

GUSTAV		These things happen in life.	 Such is life sometimes, Eva.

GUSTAV		Okay, then... Let's not talk about this anymore.

EVA			What are we going to talk about, then?

GUSTAV 		Well, I don't know!

EVA			You can't do this!

GUSTAV		Thank you, Hannah. I'm done.

EVA			Sparky!

EVA			Sparky!

GUSTAV		Eva?

GUSTAV		Eva, don't you want to come over here and take a look?

EVA			I'm reading.

GUSTAV		Listen... It's someone's birthday soon.

GUSTAV		Maybe you need some new clothes.

EVA			That might be.

GUSTAV		What do you want, then?

EVA			A crystal goniometer.

GUSTAV		I see... So what is that used for?

EVA			It's rather hard to explain.

EVA		Simply put, you can say that it's used to determine the reciprocal relationships between angles in a crystal.

EVA		And with that establish which crystal order it belongs to.

EVA			Otherwise they can't be determined.

GUSTAV		Wow!

GUSTAV		You really are one of a kind, Eva.

EVA			Fine, then!

GUSTAV		A crystal...

EVA			..goniometer.

GUSTAV		Goniometer? Crystal goniometer?

GUSTAV		Do you have any crystals to measure, then?

EVA			Sparky... Do you remember him?

GUSTAV		Yes.

EVA		Sparky and I were supposed to go up to the molybdenum mine and look for more.

EVA			That was the plan, at least.

GUSTAV		Yes, indeed. I understand.

EVA		And on my birthday, I don't want to go to the graveyard like usual.

GUSTAV		Okay... But we've always done that.

EVA		It's a waste of time. I'd much rather go see a show at Fredheim.

EVA			They have some sort of variety show there.

GUSTAV		This is going to be really exciting. Variety show, you said?

GUSTAV		Oh, well. As long as it's not that Ibsen chap. He's so tiresome.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Ladies and gentlemen!

JOHANNES JOACHIM	We're proud today to introduce the most spectacular-

JOHANNES JOACHIM	and most diverse image of human life.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	I bring you the twin girls from the moors of Ireland.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Two minds in one body. Doomed to live together until they die.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	The Lilliput lady, Nicoline Featherly.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Ladies and gentlemen, the tallest man in Europe!

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Hated and celebrated throughout the world, your own Samson Grimsen from Telemark!

JOHANNES JOACHIM	And you're the first audience ever to have the privilege of learning that only the other day-

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Miss Featherly and Mr. Grimsen were engaged! They're now about to marry in Stockholm!

JOHANNES JOACHIM	In the jungles of Borneo, there still exist undiscovered peoples and tribes.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Truly, truly mankind in all its forms is unutterably multiparous.

SPECTATOR		Is that an ape?

MAN IN AUDIENCE	We've got one of those ourselves.

GUSTAV		How dare you? How dare you come to my home?

GUSTAV		Never. Not under any circumstance.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	But was what you witnessed last night, really any more ghastly than many other things?

JOHANNES JOACHIM	A medical theater, like that one in Copenhagen.

GUSTAV		Distasteful. That's what it was.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	But people were enjoying themselves, Mr. Arctander. That's what people want.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Your daughter could get to see Berlin, London, Rome, America... She could become very rich.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	And you also could experience a certain financial independence.

GUSTAV		What do you think her dear departed mother would say?

GUSTAV		Or what people around here would say if I agree to such a thing?

GUSTAV		The answer is no.

GUSTAV		Please go now.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Could I at least ask you to give it some thought?

JOHANNES JOACHIM	We're not leaving until this afternoon.

JOHANNES JOACHIM	May I welcome you to our show?

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Well, that's a pleasure. Come...and see the others.

INSERT		TO HANNAH THANK YOU. A PRESENTATION OF HUMAN DIVERSITY one night only

JOHANNES JOACHIM	...but the lion's death at their hands provided them with an incredible inspiration!

JOHANNES JOACHIM	Come closer! Come closer!

JOHANNES JOACHIM	They were already married, but the lion's death at their hands provided them with an incredible inspiration!

EVA			When do you ever get used to it?

LILLIPUT LADY	You never get used to it.

EVA			Small rooms, large rooms.

EVA			Rooms that come and go. Towns that come and go.

EVA			Stages, fairgrounds, beer joints.

EVA		Only I stand still while everything and everyone else is in motion, making sounds and laughing.

EVA			I see now how akin and close man is to numbers and thoughts.

EVA			They are our real fathers and mothers.
	
EVA			Our only true friends who are always there.

MASTER OF		Ladies and gentlemen! It is our pleasure today to present you Professor Eve Arctander. She is going to tell us about her work on modular forms and on the Ramanujan formula.

EVA			My dear colleagues...

EVA		What has brought me here, to this very beautiful room - full of extraordinary minds? A mathematical constant,the most important number the most fascinating number in history: Pi.

EVA			Does it have anything to do with my birth gift?

EVA		This luxurious fur coat for which some women would pay an obscene amount of money to wear? Maybe, maybe not. What's more interesting is the formula I will now present to you. Thank you very much. That's fine, thank you.

MAN IN UNIFORM	Excuse me.

MAN IN UNIFORM	Eva Arctander?

EVA			Excuse me.

EVA			Thank you.

HANNAH		Excuse me, may I help you?

HANNAH		Eva!

HANNAH		My God, you are so beautiful.

HANNAH		It's strange to be here without him around.

HANNAH		Yes, he...	He was old and full of days.

HANNAH		He was ready.

THE PRIEST		And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.

THE PRIEST		Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

THE PRIEST		For Thine is the kingdom the power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.

HANNAH		None of his clothes?

EVA			No.

HANNAH		The cufflinks and the gold watch. Do you want them?

EVA			No thanks, Hannah. It's okay.

HANNAH		But, the dinner service your parents received as a wedding present...
	
HANNAH		Do you want me to pack it and send it?

EVA			No thanks, Hannah. I'm fine.

EVA			I have everything I need.

HANNAH		Okay, then I'll tend to the rest of this later.

HANNAH		And we'll have a glass of sherry.

EVA			I brought this from Paris. It came out a few years ago.

EVA			You apply it to your nails. They'll be red, like this.

EVA		You can use it if you go to a party or feel like dressing up.

EVA		But remember to blow on it, otherwise it can stick to your clothes or...

HANNAH		I hope you're glad that you came to say goodbye to him.

HANNAH		He was so anxious for you to have this.
