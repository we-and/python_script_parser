storyteller	ever since thomas the tank engine arrived on the island of sodor, he had always wanted to see the world.
storyteller	and one day...
storyteller	...he saw his chance!

storyteller	thomas and friends! really useful around the world!
storyteller	thomas goes to alaska!
storyteller	thomas was travelling through the u.s. state of alaska. he was on his way to collect some very special passengers, who were climatologists.  
storyteller	"what's a climatologist?" asked thomas. "we study the weather conditions" replied one of the climatologists. 
storyteller	it had only just got light. but it was already getting dark again!
storyteller	"up here, at this time of year, it barely gets light at all,"
storyteller	"that's a shame," said thomas. "i was looking forward to seeing alaska. but i won't be able to see very much at all if it’s dark."
storyteller	alaska was very big and very, very cold. thomas had to keep moving.
storyteller	he tried to look around. but there wasn't a great deal to see in the dark.
storyteller	when thomas finally arrived at the research outpost, there were no lights to greet him.
storyteller	but the scientists inside were very pleased to see thomas!
storyteller	they explained that their generator had broken down! they had no lights and no heat – and they were all very cold.
storyteller	thomas's driver made some nice cups of cocoa while his engineer worked on the generator. 
storyteller	thomas was waiting in the dark, when suddenly there was light! he thought the generator must have been fixed. 
storyteller	"that's not the generator. those... are the northern lights!"
storyteller	"that's the generator!" said michelle, laughing.
storyteller	the scientists were glad their generator was working again. they switched off all the outposts lights for a moment – because they wanted to see the northern lights together... with a nice hot mug of cocoa
storyteller	"now that is a sight worth seeing!" said thomas.
