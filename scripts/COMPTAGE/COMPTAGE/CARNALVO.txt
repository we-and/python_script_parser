??	Uh-huh.

??	Do you think I could hire somebody to bring us food and drink so I never have to let you go out of my arms?

??	You know, Cooper, loving you is almost a full-time job.

??	Say what?

??	When did it become a full-time job?

??	Oh, you know what I mean. No.

??	Yeah. We’re responsible for each other...

??	in a way that... I’ve never had before.

??	Uh, okay.

??	Hmm. Yeah, especially after what you told me about your ex-boyfriend.

??	I’m really surprised you went into another relationship.

??	No, Michael was just controlling.

??	He couldn’t control me, so, you know, he went a little nuts.

??	Mm-hmm. 

??	Sounds like it. But you saved me from my boyfriend drama.

??	And I feel perfectly safe in your arms.

??	Mmm.

??	Well, I’m glad. Mmm.

??	But you’re not perfectly safe from my full bladder.

??	’Cause I have to go pee.

??	And don’t drink all of that great wine.

??	Darn. Okay.

??	You want some bologna?

??	Hmm.

??	Michael? What’s the news today?

??	Same as every other day.

??	Somebody stole, somebody married, somebody died.

??	You know, Cooper, life does go on.

??	Yeah. I’m livin’.

??	Yeah, like a bitter old man.

??	Angry at the world, living in self-imposed exile.

??	I’m not angry at the world, Amy.

??	Just at the bastard who did this to me.

??	The doctor pronounced you healed months ago.

??	Doomed to live my life... on yogurt and rice for the rest of my life. 

??	You know,

??	it’s up to you what kind of life that’ll be, baby.

??	Your body’s healed. You just have to let go of the anger.

??	You couldn’t have done anything differently.

??	It happened.

??	You just have to <have to--> move on.

??	Yeah.

??	I’m sorry for being such a shit--

??	pain in the ass.

??	Yeah, you are.

??	How can I make it up to you?

??	You can... do what I ask.

??	Yeah, I know.

??	Let it go.

??	That... and kiss me.

??	Oh, God. God.

??	Mmm.

??	Yeah.

??	God.

??	Yeah.

??	God! God!

??	Hey. Hi.

??	So I think I’m gonna go out for a walk.

??	Okay.

??	You wanna come?

??	Not really.

??	You know, you’re a lot like me.

??	You may not be angry with what happened,

??	but you’re still scared.

??	I’m not scared anymore.

??	So why don’t you go out with me?

??	’Cause there’s some things you have to do on your own.

??	Things I can’t help you with.

??	Like going for a walk?

??	Talking with people strangers.

??	Trusting that some wackjob with a gun...
??	isn’t gonna suddenly whip it out and shoot you.

??	I don’t think that.

??	You walk around like you’re ready for a fight,

??	like you’re just waiting for somebody to jump you.

??	One of these days, Cooper, you’re gonna have to get over that...

??	and learn to trust people again.

??	I trust you.

??	Foolish man.

??	Now go. Get out of here.

??	Talk with people.

??	And I want a full report, please.

??	Yes, ma’am.

??	Not everybody’s a bad guy, Coop.

??	That’s what you think.

??	I used to have to use my fists to hammer on those knots...

??	when I used to run.

??	Yeah, it usually doesn’t happen too often anymore.

??	It’s the worst when you’re sleeping though.

??	God, tell me about it.

??	When I was a kid and that would happen, I’d wake up in tears.

??	You should try bananas.

??	They usually help for me.

??	- Okay.Well, enjoy the sun.

??	Enjoy your run. Thanks.

??	Conversations with a stranger,

??	check.

??	How come you don’t run anymore?

??	Uh--

??	Injury.

??	Was it your leg? No.

??	You cramping again? Yeah. 

??	Supposed to meet my boyfriend here in a little bit too,

??	so I figured... just let it rest. Oh.

??	Well, I’ll, uh, leave the beautiful park to you two.

??	You don’t have to go. I-- I didn’t mean to scare you away.

??	Actually, I’m gonna go get a coffee.

??	If I lay there any longer, I’m gonna slip into a coma.

??	Well, enjoy your coffee.

??	Enjoy your day.

??	Here, let’s take this off. I wanna see you some more.

??	You. You!

??	Oh, these are nice. Adorable!

??	Great.

??	I like them.

??	I can’t wait anymore.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Okay, okay, okay. Get in front of me. Get in front of me.

??	Did you hear that? No.

??	All right, fuck it. Just go. Just go.

??	Are you scared of getting caught?

??	I don’t give a No, I really don’t give a shit. Fuck it.

??	Oh, slow down. Why?

??	Okay, okay, okay.

??	You’re gonna make me be too loud.

??	I thought we didn’t care.

??	No, I know.

??	It’s supposed to be rough a little bit.

??	Come on. I thought you like this.

??	You want me to stop?

??	It’s okay.

??	I want you to come.

??	Oh, fuck, yeah.

??	Mmm, yeah.

??	You naughty girl.

??	Did I hurt you?

??	Little bit?

??	Mmm.

??	You’ll be fine. You’ll be fine. 

??	No!

??	Don’t. Stop it!

??	You cut me. I’m not goin’ down for that. You did that.

??	You tried to grab the knife. Get away from me.

??	That was your fault. Just go away.

??	Damn it.

??	Bastard. Bitch!

??	Hey. Hey!

??	Are you okay? Oh, shit.

??	Oh, you’re cut.

??	Yeah, he had a knife.

??	Who? Wh Where’s your boyfriend?

??	Here. That <was> my boyfriend.

??	Let’s get you some help.

??	Here. Uh, I’m gonna touch you. Can you stand up?

??	Yeah. All right.
 
??	I can’t drive like this. That’s okay. I-I’ll drive you.

??	Here.

??	I don’t even know you. Cooper. Cooper Riley.

??	Shannon Maxwell. I swear I’m not a bad guy.

??	I’m parked over here.

??	You okay?

??	We’ll get you some water.

??	Get you settled down. Thank you for these.

??	I’ll have the lab run a D.N.A. match...

??	to see if we have anything on file.

??	Now, is there anything else you can tell me about Michael Paxton?

??	We hadn’t even been dating that long.

??	Is there any reason you can think of...

??	why he might have attacked you this afternoon?

??	I told you everything. I just--

??	I don’t know that much...

??	because this was only the third time we’d ever been intimate,

??	so I don’t have anything to compare it with.

??	It’s just, there was something at the end...

??	about his intensity.

??	It scared me.

??	So when I said something to him about it afterwards,

??	that’s when he looked at me and he said, "You don’t know who you’re talking to."

??	We’ll find out who he is, Ms. Maxwell.

??	In the meantime, is there anyone you can call to stay with?

??	I don’t really-- I can look in on her. That’s not a problem.

??	Well, that would be good, Mr. Riley.

??	Yeah. Was it? Yeah.

??	Your name is very familiar to me.

??	Have I arrested you before? He’s not a bad guy, Detective.

??	Oh. I’m glad to hear it.

??	All right. In the meantime,

??	if you think of anything, please don’t hesitate to call me.

??	Please be extra cautious.

??	I will.

??	Thank you for coming, Detective.

??	Of course. That’s how I get these.

??	Sir.

??	Hey, listen, I’m sorry if I made things awkward here.

??	What are you talking about? You’ve been such a huge help.

??	And I’m the one who dragged you into this mess.

??	Uh, listen, I meant it. 

??	I can check in on you. I can come by later in the afternoon.

??	I can park outside, or, you know, whatever.

??	I didn’t mean to put you on the spot like that. I just--

??	I didn’t want the cops driving by...

??	and making my neighbors think I was a criminal.

??	Well, listen, it’s not a problem. I actually live close by, so--

??	If you’re sure it’s okay. Yeah. Yeah.

??	I can come by and bring you some food or... whatever you need.

??	Thanks, Cooper.

??	Maybe when you come back, I’ll be able to have a proper conversation with you.

??	Oh, well, sometimes proper conversations are a little overrated.

??	So says you, Mr. Mystery Man. 
	
??	Wait till I start hurling the personal questions at you.

??	Well, you haven’t seen my personal-question-blocking super powers.

??	You’ll be surprised.

??	Anyway, I’ll let you go. Um, I’ll see you later.

??	Bye, Cooper.

??	Lock these doors behind you, okay?

??	Yes, sir.

??	Hi, stranger.

??	Hey.

??	Uh, I’m sorry. I should have called you.

??	What’s going on?

??	Well, I had some conversations.

??	Good. With who?

??	A woman named Shannon.

??	I, uh, accidentally rescued her from her boyfriend.

??	I always knew you were a knight in shining armor.

??	Come here.

??	Mmm.

??	What’d you do today?

??	Waited for you...so I could do this. Oh, yeah.

??	Yeah.

??	You’re going out again?

??	Yeah. I promised Shannon that I would check in on her...

??	while the police were looking for her boyfriend.

??	Should I be worried?

??	What, you think I’m gonna jump into bed...

??	with the first woman I talk to?

??	- Is that it?

??	- Actually, I was wondering   if I should be worried...

??	that the boyfriend’s still out there.

??	I’m sorry. I crossed the line there.

??	Truth is, I don’t know anything about the guy.

??	Shannon hadn’t been dating him that long.

??	The police have his fingerprints and his D.N.A....

??	from the stuff that he left at her house,

??	so they’ll be able to find out if he has a record.

??	Just be careful, Cooper. That’s all I want.

??	You okay with this?

??	If it’s something that you need to do, then do it.

??	I’ll come home soon.

??	Mm. I’m stuffed.

??	Me too.

??	So, you weren’t kidding about this whole master of deflection stuff.

??	What’s that about?

??	I think it’s about not wanting to own up to anything that I’m proud of...

??	and not being willing to cop to it. 

??	Okay. Wow.

??	That’s pretty much the most honest thing I’ve ever heard a guy say.

??	We’re capable of honesty sometimes.

??	So, what is it that you’re not doing that you’d be proud of?

??	Well, up until about a year ago, um, I had a small tech start-up,

??	so I was calling the shots for myself and about  other employees.

??	Now I’m just doing part-time programming... 

??	for the few people that actually remember that I have a skill set.

??	Ow. What happened?

??	Uh, I was shot.

??	Oh, my gosh, Cooper. That’s horrible.

??	Who did that to you? I don’t know.

??	Some random burglar.

??	I remember waking up in the hospital,

??	and I guess I had kind of pushed everything aside, in a way,

??	so that I could, you know, speed up my recovery.

??	And, uh, I never followed up on the investigation...

??	or the aftermath.

??	Other than answering a few questions from the police,

??	I kind of just, uh, pushed everything aside.

??	Which means you basically gave up.

??	Yeah. Yeah.

??	Life, the job, people.

??	My girlfriend-- she stuck around...

??	despite my best efforts at being a jerk.

??	But, uh, everybody else kind of just gave me the space.

??	You have a girlfriend?

??	Well, like I said, she stuck around when everybody else ditched me,

??	but, uh, I think that it’s more of a, uh,

??	kind of perverse caretaker role.

??	I don’t know. Maybe if I gave up on self-pity and loathing,

??	maybe she’d feel free to go on with her life.

??	Yeah. I think you’re right about that.

??	About what?

??	That you should get over it so you can move on.

??	Is that your plan there, Miss Wrapped in a Blanket on her Love Seat?

??	Yes, actually, it is.

??	Are you gonna be in with me or are you out?

??	You realize I’ve been into this self-pity and loathing thing...

??	for about a year now, right? So?

??	It just like layers of paint.

??	You need to strip them off one by one...

??	until you get to the nice wood that’s underneath.

??	I-- I used to restore furniture,  so I know a thing or two about stripping off layers.

??	What’s the plan, and what do we do?

??	Well, I don’t know about you, but I don’t wanna feel like a victim anymore.

??	Wait. Letting the guy in...

??	is your definition of not being a victim?

??	No. Not being afraid in my home makes me feel powerful.

??	I’ll be right back.

??	I want you to put this behind your door.

??	You mean with this?

??	Oh!

??	Okay. You got me beat.

??	Well, thanks for the thought.

??	Shouldn’t you be getting home soon?

??	Um, I wouldn’t mind actually staying a bit later...

??	if <you> don’t mind. Yeah.

??	Actually, I think I’d like that a lot.

??	Ooh!

??	Mmm.

??	Oh, my—

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Hello.  Hey, Detective.
??	Can I speak with you?Yeah. Come on in.

??	I would like to talk with you about Michael Paxton.

??	Have you guys found him yet?

??	Why are they still looking for him?

??	We have people staked outat his last known address  and his workplace, but no one’s seen him since yesterday morning.

??	Yesterday?  Cooper, what’s going on?

??	I know that your car was parkedoutside of Shannon Maxwell’s house last night.

??	May I presume that he didn’t show up there?

??	No, he didn’t. Uh--

??	I wouldn’t recognize him if he did. I’ve never met the guy.

??	That is a fascinating thing you just said there, Mr. Riley.

??	You met Michael Paxton.

??	It says here that he shot you.

??	It also says that you had a reluctance to learn anything about your case.

??	You really didn’t know his name, did you?

??	And it an accident that you happened to be in the park yesterday...while he was there with Ms. Maxwell.
	
??	Yeah.
	
??	I would like to advise extreme caution.

??	It is very possible that Michael Paxton...

??	believes he has unfinished business with you Ms. Maxwell.

??	Here’s the file about your case...

??	should you ever wanna learn any more.

??	Cooper, be careful. I have a bad feeling about this guy.

??	I am so sorry, Amy.

??	You lied to me.

??	I never meant for any of this to happen.

??	I-- I didn’t mean to hurt you.

??	Michael Paxton is gonna come back here.

??	He’s gonna hurt you again if he knows that you’re with her.

??	How do you know that? I saw him that night.

??	Didn’t you? You saw him?
	
??	What, do you know him? Cooper.

??	Michael Paxton’s my ex-boyfriend.

??	He’s not some random thief. He came here on purpose.

??	Why?

??	To hurt me.

??	And I’m the one who got shot.

??	Hurt you. Hurt me. It’s all the same.

??	So you’re telling me your crazy ex-boyfriend shot me,

??	and now he’s gonna come back after me?

??	Un-fucking-believable.
	
??	You know, thanks for letting me think that this was some random bad guy.

??	You think this information could have helped me get over my shit a long time ago maybe?

??	Oh, Cooper.

??	I never meant to hurt you.

??	She knew.

??	She knew the entire time. She didn’t tell me.  I don’t know how I feel about this, Shannon.

??	She had this wounded look on her face when I left.

??	And that detective?

??	Didn’t he see her standing there when he basically accused me of sleeping with you?

??	What kind of jerk does that?

??	She didn’t deserve to find out like this.

??	No one does, you know.

??	Bad enough that I did it.

??	Hey, listen. I wanna be honorable with you.

??	I hate the fact that I I didn’t break up with her.

??	It’s disrespectful to both of you.

??	And... I wasn’t sorry that I did it.

??	I’m just sorry that it got so messy.

??	Okay.

??	Amy and I are over. You get that, right?

??	And I don’t wanna hate her, but...

??	I feel like she’s been lying to me for the whole year.

??	Maybe it’s guilt.

??	Guilt?

??	Why?
 
??	I mean, this guy wouldn’t have shown up at your house if it wasn’t for her,

??	but he did,

??	and then you got hurt.

??	God, it was so much easier when my guilt was the only thing on the table.

??	Guilt is useless.

??	You mean it’s much easier to wallow in...

??	than taking responsibility.

??	You need to buck up,

??	and I think it’s time you get back in the game.

??	Well, it’s only appealing if you’re the one who’s playing with me.

??	You know, I just don’t know if you’re any good at it.

??	Yeah?

??	I’ll show you good.

??	You got way too many clothes on.

??	That feels so good.

??	God, you feel so good.

??	This fucking guy. Where is he?

??	You said he’d be here by now. I don’t know, Michael.

??	Okay, well, do you know why you’re even with him?

??	I mean, he’s a fucking useless guy.

??	Seriously, he can’t defend you.

??	You think that I would let someone sneak up on <me> with a weapon?

??	I mean, seriously, do I look stupid?

??	I mean--

??	Please, why are you with him?

??	Just tell me that. Why are you with him?

??	Actually, I was just about to go.

??	Actually, it’s just about that time.

??	Come with me.
 
??	Why would I wanna do that? We could leave  right now.

??	Cooper would never even haveto know where I’ve gone.

??	No. Let me-- Let me explain something to you.

??	I’m not leaving here until I’m done with that bastard.

??	Okay? I saw him creep through the bushes that day.

??	I should have finished his little fucking punk ass back then.

??	Why did you hurt that girl? Why do you care?

??	You have to stop hurting people, Michael.

??	It’s not worth it in the end, I promise.

??	You know, I wonder--

??	I wonder if that little slimebag is over there with her right now,

??	trying to weasel his way back in her arms playing some hero role.

??	I don’t give a shit, Amy.

??	I’ll fucking kill ’em both right now! Fine, fine, fine.

??	But I won’t be here when you get back.

??	Okay. Y-Y-You’re putting yourself in front of me to try to stop me.

??	I get that.

??	If you’re so sure he’s with someone else, why would I do that?

??	I don’t know. Prove it.

??	Prove what?

??	Prove that you want me more than you want him.

??	You wanna know something?

??	I saw you two that day.

??	Yeah. I saw you fucking him.

??	And I hated you for it.

??	Love and hate  aren’t opposites, Michael.

??	Love and indifference are.

??	If you hated me,it’s because you still wanted me.

??	Hmm. Maybe.

??	I hated you for a long time.

??	And how do you feel now?

??	Now?

??	I want you to fuck me.

??	Oh, God.

??	Oh, fuck!

??	What the fuck is going on here, Amy?

??	You’re dead.

??	Uh, Detective Sims, please.

??	Yeah. It’s Cooper Riley, Detective.

??	I have Michael Paxton here with a blunt-force injury to his head.

??	No, no, I’m-I’m okay.

??	Okay, thanks.

??	"Victim number one,  Cooper Riley.

??	Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

??	Transported to the County Medical Trauma Unit.

??	Victim number two, Amy Stanton. Gunshot wound to the heart"?

??	"Died at the scene"?

??	Michael?

??	You’re dead?

??	You were just so lost.

??	I was just trying to help you find your way.

??	I have to go, Cooper.

??	I-- I’m not ready yet.

??	You’re ready.

??	I will always love you.

??	Me too.

??	You okay, Riley?

??	Yeah. Just getting some closure.

??	Yeah, it could happen like that.

??	Good thing too, or we’d all be in therapy for the rest of our lives.

??	Yeah. Detective Sims.

??	Dear Cooper, you’ve always been the man of my dreams,

??	but now it’s time to put me away in yours and get on with your life.

??	I love you with all my heart.

??	Amy.

??	Hey, cutie. Ready to roll?

??	As ready as I’m gonna be.

??	Come get me.
