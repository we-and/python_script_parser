STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends: Really Useful around the World!
STORYTELLER	Thomas travels to Greece!

STORYTELLER	“Today is a very special day!” said Dmitri the well dressed passenger.

STORYTELLER	“My Brother is getting married! In the highest village in the region!” 

STORYTELLER	Thomas wanted to know what Dimitri was carrying. And he told him, “Some very special plates!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas pulled away smoothly – he didn’t want to shake his passengers or damage any special plates.

STORYTELLER	At the next station, Thomas picked up the wedding band. The music they played made everybody very happy!

STORYTELLER	Thomas tried not to go too fast on the mountain railway.

STORYTELLER	But it was very exciting! And the Greek music made Thomas want to go faster! And faster!

STORYTELLER	But then he remembered about the special plates and he slowed down.

STORYTELLER	Thomas’s passengers urged him to hurry! But Thomas didn’t want to arrive with boxes of broken plates!

STORYTELLER	At last, Thomas arrived at the wedding – proud that he had given all the wedding guests a safe and steady ride.

STORYTELLER	Thomas’s Driver and Fireman were invited to stay for the wedding – and so Thomas stayed too.

STORYTELLER	After the wedding ceremony, some of the guests threw plates on the ground – smashing them to pieces!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was surprised! “Don’t worry, Thomas!” said Dimitri. “We smash plates to bring luck to the Bride and Groom!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas laughed! Perhaps he should have gone faster around the mountains after all!
