TOLI	THEY SAY LIFE IS SHORT. YOU MUST LIVE EVERY DAY AS IF IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR LAST.

TSHEPO	What must I bring you from the zoo, Mommy?

TOLI	You can bring me anything you like. Oh, just don't bring me an elephant. It won't fit into this small house of ours.

TOLI	THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I USED TO LIVE, UNTIL SIX YEARS AGO WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY SON. THAT WAS BOTH THE BEST AND WORST DAY OF MY LIFE. THAT'S THE DAY I BECAME A BABY MAMA.

TUMI	Let's go, before we get stuck in traffic. Here's your bag.

TOLI	Oh, enjoy your day, guys.

TUMI	Jacket?

TSHEPO	Bye, Mommy.

TOLI	Ah, Tumi, please make sure your son doesn't bring me any animals from the zoo.

TUMI	Can't promise you anything.

TOLI	Bye.

TUMI	Cheers.

SAMUEL	You keep the change.

CASHIER	Thank you very much, sir.

SAMUEL	Okay. Hey, are you sure you don't want to join me in Cape Town for the conference? I mean, my PA can easily book a ticket for you.

SANDY	I, unlike you, I am not the CEO of the company I work for. I can't just take unexpected trips to Cape Town.

SAMUEL	Take leave.

SANDY	Mm? You do know I'll be just here when you get back from Cape Town, neh?

SAMUEL	Ja.

SAMUEL	Don't do anything I wouldn't do while I'm gone, right?

SANDY	Of course.

SAMUEL	Uhh. Jonga, take yourself out for a spa treatment, baby.

SANDY	Mm. Mmm.

SAMUEL	Ah.

SIZWE	Mm. Mm. Mm. Look at you.

JOY	Stop. Stop. You look quite gorgeous yourself.

SIZWE	Ah, and so do you.

JOY	Sizwe, don't.

SIZWE	Mm.

JOY	We're going to be late for work. Don't.

SIZWE	It's for a minute.

JOY	Baby, don't. No, no, stop it. You're so bad. You're terrible.

JOY	I can't believe you, you always get me.

TOLI	NOW, A BABY MAMA, IS A FEMALE WHO HAS A CHILD WITH A MALE USUALLY OUTSIDE OF WEDLOCK. THE MALE AND THE FEMALE DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE, OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE FEMALE'S DECISION TO KEEP THE BABY. ONCE THE CHILD IS HERE CONFLICT CAN BE INCREASED BY ONE PARTY'S REFUSAL TO HELP RAISE THE CHILD.

SANDY	Hi, Ma. How did things go with Thandiwe?

MAM'SONTO	Oh, well, you know how she gets after she comes home seeing her father. Never stops talking about him.

SANDY	Hm. Did he bring her back on time last night?

MAM'SONTO	Yes, but...

SANDY	But what, Ma?

TOLI	THE PARTY THAT USUALLY REFUSES IS THE MALE, LEAVING THE FEMALE TO FEND FOR THE CHILD WITH THE HELP OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

MAM'SONTO	It was his girlfriend who brought Thandiwe into the house.

SANDY	What?! He let that woman bring my child into my house, Ma? Ma, I'll call you back.

MAM'SONTO	Oh, Sandy.

SANDY	I will call you back, Ma.

TOLI	IN CASES WHERE THE MALE CHANGES HIS MIND AND WANTS TO BE A PART OF THE CHILD'S LIFE, THAT CAUSES A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONFLICT. 

NTUTHUKO	Hey, Sandy.

SANDY	Ntuthuko, how dare you bring that woman into my mother's house?

NTUTHUKO	Sandy, don't you think it's a bit early for us to be fighting about this? Can we talk about his later?

SANDY	Nyane nxom nganinyenya. We're gonna talk about it now, Ntuthuko!

NTUTHUKO	What do you want from me, Sandy? I brought the child back on time. You don't tell me there's people I can have or not have in my own car.

SANDY	Oh, I see. You're trying me, eh? You're really, really trying me.

NTUTHUKO	Okay, for your information, it was actually Thandiwe who asked Khethi to walk her in.

SANDY	Well, that is the last time you see my daughter.

NTUTHUKO	Oh, no, no, come on, Sandy, you can't do that. She's my daughter, too.

SANDY	She's been your daughter for two minutes, Ntuthuko.

NTUTHUKO	Two min..?

SANDY	She's been mine for ten years.

NTUTHUKO	Okay, Sandy, okay. We're just being unreasonable here, we can talk...

KEENAN	Whew. Baby. You're my everything. Howzit?

KEENAN	Are you okay, baby?

CHANTEL	Yes.

KEENAN	Are you sure?

CHANTEL	Yes.

KEENAN	Baby, I can see you're not okay. What's wrong? Is it your parents?

CHANTEL	They're gonna kill me.

KEENAN	What did you do? Why?

CHANTEL	This.

KEENAN	What's this, Chantel?

CHANTEL	A pregnancy test, Keenan, and it's positive.	

KEENAN	Shit. Okay, how true are these things anyway? I suggest you go to the doctor to go make sure, okay?

CHANTEL	And then what? What if the doctor still says I'm pregnant, Keenan?

KEENAN	Then we'll take care of it.

TOLI	TUMI IS A GREAT FATHER. HE WAS A LOUSY BOYFRIEND, BUT HE'S A GREAT 

FATHER.

TUMI	Alright. Come. I will come and pick you up later on.	

TSHEPO	Bye, Dad. I love you.

TUMI	I love you, too, my boy. Oh.

TUMI	Toli.

TOLI	Tumi, I think you just sent me a message meant for your mom.

TUMI	No, it was actually meant for you.

TOLI	Thanks for dropping T off at creche. Remember it's your turn to pick him up all week. Neh?

TUMI	Yes, yes, I remember.

TOLI	Okay.

TUMI	Toli, what about the other part of the message?

TOLI	Ja, you see? That's the part I thought was meant for your mom.

TUMI	It was meant for you.

TOLI	Tumi...

TUMI	Look, you don't have to say it back.

TOLI	I wasn't going to.

TUMI	Ouch.

TOLI	Thanks. Thank you for your love.

TUMI	Sure. Good luck with your interview this morning.

TOLI	Thank you. Thank you. I will see you tonight when you bring back my child.

TUMI	I'll still love you tonight.

TOLI	Bye-bye, Tumisang.

TOLI	SOMETIMES I WISH I HAD SOMEONE TO CUDDLE WITH AT NIGHT, OR JUST HAVE A QUICKY WITH. BUT MOST TIMES I WONDER IF IT WON'T JUST BE EASIER TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH TUMI.

TOLI	Chantel?

JOY	Okay, let's try this again.

SIZWE	Alright, yep. Boom.

JOY	You look very handsome.

SIZWE	You look gorgeous.

JOY	Mm. Later. We're not gonna do this again.

SIZWE	Alright. Oh, swagger.

JOY	I think we're hot. Wipe your lips. Let's go.

TOLI	Michael, I don't remember booking you this morning.

MICHAEL	Oh, no, I was busy upstairs, and I thought I'd come down and say good luck before I left.

TOLI	Good luck?

MICHAEL	Ja, for your interview?

TOLI	You remembered? Thank you, thank you. I'll see you soon. I've gotta go.

MICHAEL	Cool, good luck.

TOLI	Thank you.

TOLI	Oh, Chantel.

CHANTEL	I'm sorry.

TOLI	Hey, friend, what's the matter? Is there anything I can do to help you? Friend? Okay, Toli, you got this.

PICKERING	I see you certainly do have a lot to offer our company. But you haven't told us why you should get the promotion. Something I think the HR department would also like to know.

EVELYN	Yes.

TOLI	Thank you for that question, Mr Pickering. I don't think I need to tell you why I should get the promotion. You've seen my stats in the last 12 months. Since I started in this position, no one has been able to match them. I've implemented systems that everyone was afraid to implement. I've improved staff morale and as a result the staff have been able to achieve great results. Overall, I have managed to bring in a little over R1-million in sales...

PICKERING	We've read your resume. Toli, what are you going to do about your child?

TOLI	What exactly do you mean, sir?

PICKERING	Don't take offence, but this is gonna be a very demanding job. There are times where you will have to work nights. I see here, you're always going off to fetch the boy from school, go to the doctor, parent/teacher meetings.

TOLI	What exactly were you hoping I do with my son? Sell him to the highest bidder?

PICKERING	You're taking my question completely out of context. I didn't mean it like that, Evelyn. What I meant...

TOLI	You just meant that I shouldn't get the promotion because I'm a mother. Yes, I might need to get off early from time to time, but I can assure you that would never affect my overall performance. In fact, my son motivates me to work harder than anyone else here. I want to build a bright future for him, just like you have done with your kids, Mr Pickering.

PICKERING	Thank you, Toli, thank you for coming in. I think that will be all. You do know that we're interviewing other candidates?

TOLI	Of course. Thank you for seeing me.

SANDY	So, spill, how did it go?

TOLI	I don't know.

SANDY	No, Toli. What happened? That job was yours.

TOLI	Let's go make some tea and I'll tell you all about it.

JOY	See you later.

SIZWE	Hm.

TOLI	So, tell me, are you still on diet?

SANDY	What are you on about?

TOLI	Am I pouring five sugars or just one?

SANDY	Mm, better pour five, chom, you've had a rough morning.

TOLI	I'm the one having a rough morning, but you're the one having five sugars? Okay, friend.

SANDY	What happened? Did "Pick-on-me" start with his old, dirty tricks again?

TOLI	I am so over that man.

SANDY	What did he do?

TOLI	So, basically, he asked me whether my being a mother would affect my work.

SANDY	What?! Is he even allowed to ask that, friend? It is not our fault we have children. Just because he has a housewife, does not mean we all have one as well. You know what, let's just go outside and have a smoke.

TOLI	I'll find you there. I'm going to the bathroom. Please bring my tea with you.

SANDY	Sure.

TOLI	Thanks, friend.

TOLI	SO, THERE ARE FOUR STAGES OF BEING A BABY MAMA. CHANTEL IS GOING THROUGH THE FIRST ONE, THE WHAT- WILL-PEOPLE-SAY STAGE. OOH, I REMEMBER THIS STAGE.

CHANTEL	Keenan, Kee..? Keenan? Hello? He hung up.

TOLI	Chantel, you really don't seem okay today. Are you sick? Do you wanna go home?

CHANTEL	Toli, I think I'm pregnant.

TOLI	THIS IS WHEN THE BABY MAMA IS CONCERNED ABOUT HOW HER FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND THE COMMUNITY WILL VIEW HER WHEN THEY FIND OUT THAT SHE IS PREGNANT BY SOMEONE WHO EITHER DENIES THE PATERNITY OF THE CHILD OR IS NOT READY TO BE A FATHER AS YET.

CHANTEL	The test said that you should do it in the morning, and I did, and it came out positive. Two pink lines means positive, right?

TOLI	Um, I think so. Friend, there's no need to panic, it really just depends on the test. Why not try going to the doctor just to be sure?

CHANTEL	It's not supposed to happen like this.

TOLI	I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S ALWAYS THE WOMAN'S FAULT WHEN SHE GETS PREGNANT. IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WAS BY HERSELF WHEN SHE CONCEIVED.

SANDY	I can't believe Pickering. He probably wants you to suck up to him so you can get that promotion.

TOLI	Ooh, shame. If he thinks I'm like the other girls that he's used to, he's got another thing coming. If he doesn't wanna give me the promotion, I will apply for it elsewhere.

SANDY	Where, Toli? Don't you dare leave me here.

TOLI	Friend, I found you here.

SANDY	That's not the point.

TOLI	Did you hear from Joy this weekend?

SANDY	No, she was supposed to come my place, so I can take her the bag place in town. No show.

TOLI	Oh, she's asking where we are.

SANDY	But where would we be at this time of the morning? Joy asks stupid questions.

TOLI	Would you leave her alone? Why are you so grumpy this morning?

SANDY	Ntuthuko. Who else?

TOLI	Have you told him you love him yet? Friend, you better get that out of the way.

JOY	Hey, ladies, we slay, all day! Good morning. Look at us looking so pretty.

TOLI	Hey, baby.

SANDY	Don't come here with your cheap flattery, neh, Joy.

JOY	Why you so angry? Sandy, you know what you need to do? This part of your body, particularly this part of your body, you need to use it to get laid, get laid, get laid. Howzit?

SANDY	Who says I am not getting laid? Second of all, you were supposed to come over to my house, so I can show you the bag shop in town, remember?

JOY	Oh! There's that. Sorry, friend. Something better came up.

SANDY	What the..?

SANDY	So, basic rules of respect, ne? When something better comes along, you let the people that you had plans with know, ie; your friends, that you won't make it anymore.

JOY	Sandy, you're taking this so seriously, it's not like you have anything better to do.

SANDY	I actually did.

SANDY	Boutique hotel with Samuel.

JOY	Oh... 

TOLI	Hey! And?

SANDY	He wants me to go with him to Cape Town.

SANDY	But I have a J-O-B.

JOY	Of course you do.

TOLI	Yes. you do.

JOY	So.. girls..

SANDY	Oh, dear.

JOY	I didn't go to a boutique hotel, but.. I was with Sizwe.

SANDY	Sizwe? The same Sizwe who kicked you out of the house in the middle of the night, that Sizwe?

JOY	Why're you being so judgmental, though? He's better. He had issues back then.

TOLI	Friend, he used to beat you. I don't know why you would go back.

JOY	See, you guys are always focusing on the negative, though. This is why I didn't want to tell you that Sizwe and I are back together again.

TOLI	Hey?

SANDY	Hey?

JOY	Why can't you just be happy for me?

TOL	Famous last words.

JOY	He's better, he's changed. I swear, he's really a better man. You know we're talking marriage?

SANDY	No, you're talking marriage. That man is not going to marry you, or anyone else for that matter.

SANDY	Sorry, ladies, I've got to go.

JOY	Where's Chantel?

TOLI	Friend, I actually saw her in the bathroom earlier.

JOY	Oh.

TOLI	She's not okay.

SANDY	Oh, no.

TOLI	Clearly, we have a lot to catch up on. Lunchtime?

SANDY	No, no, no. We've got that managers meeting at lunch.

TOLI	I forgot about that. Dinner, drinks, my place, soon.

JOY	Sure, done.

SANDY	Done.

TOLI	Tell Chantel when you see her.

JOY	Will do. Will do.

TOLI	Later.

JOY	So can I tell you about Sizwe?

SANDY	Huh-uh, wena. Don't talk to me.

KEENAN	WHAT'S THIS, CHANTEL?

CHANTEL	A PREGNANCY TEST, KEENAN, AND IT'S POSITIVE.

KEENAN	SHIT!

KEENAN	I SUGGEST YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR TO MAKE SURE, OKAY?

CHANTEL	AND THEN WHAT? WHAT IF THE DOCTOR STILL SAYS I'M PREGNANT, KEENAN?

KEENAN	THEN WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

DOCTOR	Uh.. Chantel Steyn? Chantel? Follow me, please.

CHANTEL	I took a pregnancy test and it came out positive.

DOCTOR	Mm-hm.

CHANTEL	How accurate are these things?

DOCTOR	Well, they're quite accurate these days. Why don't you tell me what made you take the test in the first place?

CHANTEL	I missed my period.

DOCTOR	Mm-hm.

CHANTEL	It always comes on time.

DOCTOR	And when was the last time you had your period?

CHANTEL	22nd of last month.

DOCTOR	22nd...

DOCTOR	Alright. Let's.. let's have a look.

TOLI	Hey!

TUMI	Shh, he's sleeping.

TOLI	Aw. What's with the stuffed animal?

TUMI	He promised you a lion, that's your lion.

TOLI	Oh...

TOLI	And this?

TUMI	I heard the traffic was a mess, so I figured you'd be held up, so I'm cooking.

TOLI	Tumi, we need to talk.

TUMI	Not tonight. Tonight we eat, okay?

TOLI	While I appreciate the gesture, you do know you don't have to cook for me in my house, right?

TUMI	Oh, no, I know. And I wasn't cooking for you, I was cooking for our son.

TOLI	Okay. 

TUMI	Toli.. I know that we still love each other.

TOLI	Um...

TUMI	'Kay. I still love you. And I know that you like me.. but I want you to love me again. Look, I.. I want us to be together again.

TOLI	Tumi.. something is burning!

TUMI	Oh, shi...

TUMI	Ooh...

MAM'SONTO	I hope you didn't go to Ntuthuko's office this morning and start fighting with him.

SANDY	No, Ma, I didn't. I spoke to him on the phone.

MAM'SONTO	Huh. And what did you tell him?

SANDY	About what?

MAM'SONTO	That you still love him.

SANDY	Yoh. Hai, you don't understand, Mom.

MAM'SONTO	The sooner you let that boy know you love him, the better.

SANDY	It's not that simple, Mama.

MAM'SONTO	Well, make it simple. Because I am sick and tired of you fighting with him.

SANDY	Thandiwe, come eat, baby.

MAM'SONTO	Come, my baby. You eat.

KEENAN	I was worried about you.

CHANTEL	I'm still pregnant.

KEENAN	Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but is it mine?

KEENAN	You see? You're taking it the wrong way. I.. I just.. you know, I don't know if being a father is part of my plans right now. Like, I'm still young and there's things I want to do. I want to buy a new car, there's these new sneakers coming out. Actually, I've got plans, Chantel.

CHANTEL	I'm sorry for ruining your plans, Keenan.

KEENAN	You see? Taking it the wrong way again.

CHANTEL	I just expected more from someone who was raised by a single mother.

JOY	Sizwe, baby, your phone's ringing.

SIZWE	You have no business going through my phone.

JOY	I did not go through your phone, and it's on silent, why?

SIZWE	Well, that's none of your business. I don't ask you about your phone, do I?

JOY	What's going on? Things were okay until your phone rang.

SIZWE	Things were okay until you went through my phone, Joy.

JOY	I did not go through your phone. I didn't even see who was...

SIZWE	Eish, Joy, Joy, you know what? I don't like it when you don't trust me.

JOY	I'm so confused. What's going on here?

SIZWE	What is going on is that you keep going through my damn phone! That's what's going on! You know what? Pack all your things and get the hell out of my house, right now. Joy.. I'm sorry, okay. I didn't mean it. You didn't go through my phone, I'm sorry.

JOY	Sizwe...

SIZWE	I don't want to lose you again, okay? I love you.

JOY	Just...

SIZWE	Joy, hey.. I love you. I'm sorry.

TA'CHASE	Lizzy, baby!

MAM'LIZZY	Why are you so happy?

TA'CHASE	You should of told me.

MAM'LIZZY	Told you what?

TA'CHASE	I'm still a man.

MAM'LIZZY	Stop it! You don't need me to tell you you're still a man, you know you are.

TA'CHASE	And that Chantel might be having a little brother, or a sister.

MAM'LIZZIE	How? (GASPING) Chantel!

TOLI	MOST GIRLS NEVER FIND OUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO DISAPPOINT THEIR PARENTS. BUT THOSE OF US WHO'VE FALLEN PREGNANT BEFORE MARRIAGE, GET TO SEE THE SPARKLE FADE RIGHT FROM THEIR EYES.

TOLI	"THAT WOMAN IS NOT GOING NEAR MY CHILD" STAGE, IS THE SECOND AND WORST STAGE THAT ANY BABY MAMMA CAN BE IN. BECAUSE YOU WANT WANT TO BE THE ONLY WOMAN, STANDING NEXT TO YOUR BABY DADDY.

NTUTHUKO	Oh, monster. You're getting heavy. Ready for school?

THANDIWE	Yes, Baba.

NTUTHUKO	A sucker?

THANDIWE	Thank you.

NTUTHUKO	Hey.

TOLI	IN YOUR MIND, THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE, THAT YOU CAN STILL WORK OUT YOUR ISSUES, AND HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS THAT LUCKY.

NTUTHUKO	That's good. Hello, Sandy.

SANDY	So it's not enough that you bring her here once, you have to bring her here again for effect?

NTUTHUKO	Okay, I'm sorry, Sandy. I didn't think you'd be offended.

SANDY	Well, that's it, right there, Ntuthuko, I don't think you think at all. And the only reason I am allowing you to take her today, is for that stupid Daddy-And-Daughter Dance thing today.

NTUTHUKO	Well, thank you for allowing me... Sandy.. I need to tell you something, and I don't want you to find it out, from other people, okay?

SANDY	Yes?

NTUTHUKO	My uncles went over to Khethi's house to ask for her hand in marriage. And I know how you get, so I was wondering, if Thandi could possibly come to the wedding in a few months time? And I know.. It won't be any problems for you, I'll pick her up, I'll drop her off, there'll be nothing...

SANDY	Whoa.. Wait.. You're getting married?

NTUTHUKO	Yeah.

SANDY	So you don't think there's a chance for us to get back together?

NTUTHUKO	How? We tried that, all we do is we fight all the time.

SANDY	We were young, I had some growing up to do.

NTUTHUKO	What..? Well, Ket.. Khethi makes me happy.

SANDY	And I didn't?

NTUTHUKO	Oh, come on, you can't take it like that. We just didn't work out between the both of us, okay? Oh.. Sandy...

SANDY	Just please bring her back on time.

NTUTHUKO	Don't...

MAM'SONTO	What..? Come. Come.

MAM'SONTO	What is it?

SANDY	He's getting married.. to her.

MAM'SONTO	Oh, my dear. Oh, my love.

MAM'LIZZIE	So, how are you feeling?

CHANTEL	I'm okay, Ma.

MAM'LIZZIE	Listen, I know your Dad and I were upset with the whole situation. But I want you to know, we're here for you, okay? Anything you need.

CHANTEL	Thank you. I know I disappointed you guys.

MAM'LIZZIE	No. Just.. surprised.

MAM'LIZZIE	Have you thought about your options? And?

CHANTEL	I'm going to keep the baby.

MAM'LIZZIE	I'm so glad. Oh, and your father will be too. I don't want you to feel alone at this time in your life. I know your mom's not around anymore.

CHANTEL	You've been the best stepmom any girl could ask for.

MAM'LIZZIE	Hm.

TOLI	Yes, Mbali?

MBALI	Hi, Toli, Michael is here for you.

TOLI	Okay, cool, thank you. I'll be right there.

MICHAEL	There we go.

TOLI	Hey, Michael.

MICHAEL	Hey, Toli.

TOLI	Hm.

MICHAEL	Looking beautiful as always.

TOLI	Thank you, let me take you through.

TOLI	Ah, let me know when you're done, I'll come back for you.

MICHAEL	Cool, well, I should be done just before lunch, maybe we can grab a bite together?

TOLI	Sure.

MICHAEL	Alright.

TOLI	Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

CHANTEL	It's fine, I don't know where my head is.

TOLI	You've been staring at that screen all day. Are you okay? Last time we spoke...

CHANTEL	Yes, I was a mess.

TOLI	Have you and Keenan sorted things out yet?

CHANTEL	I wish. Decided to keep the baby though.

TOLI	That's great, Chantel.

CHANTEL	My parents have been so supportive. I thought they were gonna kill me.

TOLI	You are gonna be just fine. You have your parents and you've got us.

CHANTEL	Thanks, love.

TOLI	Keenan will come around. He's probably just scared. You know what, I think we need a proper catch up session. I have not seen you girls in such a long time. Drinks at my house tomorrow night?

CHANTEL	That will be great. Just as long as there's juice.

TOLI	Of course.

WAITER	Good day, how are you?

NTUTHUKO	How are you?

WAITER	Good thanks.

NTUTHUKO	Bubble-gum milkshake.. and a hot chocolate.

THANDIWE	Thanks for the milkshake, Daddy.

NTUTHUKO	It's a pleasure, monster. It's my pleasure. What do you think of Sis'Khethi?

THANDIWE	I think she's nice.

NTUTHUKO	Think she's nice? You know that Daddy likes her, right? A lot.

THANDIWE	Yes.

NTUTHUKO	What would you say if I told you that Daddy's gonna marry her?

THANDIWE	Really?

NTUTHUKO	Yeah.

THANDIWE	Can I be a flower girl?

NTUTHUKO	Of course you can be a flower girl. I'd be honoured to have you as a flower girl. Think your mom will be happy about me marrying somebody else?

THANDIWE	If she knows it's something that will make you happy, then she will be happy for you in the end.

NTUTHUKO	You think? I recon also. High-five, monster. You're very smart. What are they teaching in grade three now? Physics? Do you know what physics is? That's cool.

MICHAEL	So that's pretty much what I've been up too, you know, just looking after the business and my sister's overseas at the moment but my mom's still here.

TOLI	Hm. Oh.

MICHAEL	Thanks.

TOLI	Thank you. And any girlfriends? There must be a long queue of women waiting in line.

MICHAEL	I wish. It seems the one woman that I really like, just doesn't seem to notice me.

TOLI	Really? Who wouldn't notice that cute smile of yours?

MICHAEL	You really have no idea, do you?

TOLI	Huh?

MICHAEL	It's you, Toli.

TOLI	Michael...

MICHAEL	Sorry, I got to rush but this has been a really good day.

TOLI	It has indeed.

MICHAEL	We should do it again some time? Maybe dinner? Let me bring my A-game this time.

TOLI	Ah, I would like to see your A-game.

MICHAEL	Good. I'll be in touch.

TOLI	Cool.

TOLI	Refill.

CHANTEL	Yes.

JOY	Thank you. Finally.


SANDY	Yeah!

TOLI	There you go.

JOY	The thirst, oh, my gosh.

TOLI	Grapes for Chantel. So, we spoke about his mom and sister, how he's been looking after them since his Dad passed away.

JOY	Oh, Toli, he sounds like such a sweet person though.

SANDY	Ja, ja, ja, sweet, sweet, sweet. When are you guys kissing? Hey?

TOLI	Ah.. Who says we haven't already?

SANDY	Wow! 

JOY	Hey, now? Hey.

CHANTEL	And? How was it?

TOLI	Well.. He kissed me on the cheek.

SANDY	Whoa.

JOY	Oh. You are such an embarrassment. That doesn't count as a kiss though, at all.

CHANTEL	Mm-mm.

TOLI	You guys didn't specify where this kiss should be.

SANDY	Oh, no, friend, I mean, is that how you got pregnant with Tshepo? With a peck on the cheek? That would mean that Tumi was depriving you of all that goodness.

JOY	Yes.

TOLI	It's all still very new. I don't even know if we should even be together.

SANDY	Oh.

CHANTEL	There you go again, Toli. Always finding reason to avoid being happy with someone.

JOY	Hm. Yes.

TOLI	I do not avoid being happy.

SANDY	Ja. Ja.

JOY	Nuh-uh. You do. You always do it. Okay, let's put you through the test. Girls, help me with this one.

SANDY	Let go.

JOY	So isn't it for the past couple of months, Tumi has been begging you guys to get back together again, and what's your response? Deny, deny, deny. Ah-huh-huh.

SANDY	Deny!

CHANTEL	Deny.

TOLI	Are you guys forgetting what Tumi did to me?

SANDY	Yes, we know what he did, friend, but that doesn't mean Michael's going to do the same thing. I mean, he's a little bit more mature than what Tumi was when he started dating.

CHANTEL	You can't even compare the two.

JOY	I agree with him. I don't think Michael is the type of person who would.. See, let's run a checklist. One, knock you up.

TOLI	Ja.

JOY	Two, deny paternity.

SANDY	Uh...

JOY	Three, get his crazy side-chicks to call you, drive you crazy, and not even contribute a cent towards your medical bills.

SANDY	Yes, guys. To be fair, Tumi was very young when he did that.

JOY	Uh-uh, soeke.

SANDY	It's been years now, he's changed, right?

CHANTEL	You'd swear Tumi and Keenan were raised in the same house.

SANDY	It's like, so. Same WhatsApp. So.

JOY	Same WhatsApp group.

TOLI	Still no word from him?

CHANTEL	Nothing! I've sent him messages asking if we can meet so we can talk, he doesn't reply.

JOY	Mm. Chantel, let's be honest. If he were to call, would you take him back?

CHANTEL	Honestly, guys, I don't know what I want from him.

JOY	You see, now? That for me is a big problem. You're gonna have to sort that out, 'cause you know what's gonna happen to you in your life? You're gonna end up with a baby daddy that you still love, and he's moved on and now you're miserable.

SANDY	Wow. Ay. Uh-uh. Whoa. Whoa. Stop now.

JOY	No, true story. True.. What?

SANDY	Why are we throwing shade now?

JOY	No, guys. Be fair, I'm not throwing any shade.

SANDY	Oh?

JOY	I'm telling her as it is, true story. What would you like to see happen? You wanna see our poor, little friend here date married men who aren't available, because also she's got these little hopes that Keenan's gonna come back to her. Guys, come on.

SANDY	Wow, that's shady.

JOY	Girl, take my advice.

SANDY	You are so over-simplifying it, it's not even funny.

JOY	Okay. Is that not what's happening in your life?

SANDY	Guys? Yes, but...

JOY	Thank you. Stop right there. I rest...

SANDY	What?

JOY	I rest my case. Toli, top me up! Let's drink!

SANDY	When did this come to me now?

JOY	I win.

SANDY	Oh, my.. Wow! Wow. Wow.

JOY	Did you just throw a grape at me?

SANDY	Well, you deserve more! You should have a whole grape tree on top of...

TOLI	Yes! I did!

JOY	I will eat that grape and drink these grapes.

TUMI	Okay, you don't have to rub it in.

TSHEPO	Yes!

TSHEPO	I won!

TUMI	Alright. It is time for us to go to bed. Let's go.

TSHEPO	But, Dad, if I go and sleep, you won't have anyone left to talk to.

TUMI	Yeah, but if you go to bed, then I can stay up all night practicing this game and make sure that I beat you tomorrow.

TSHEPO	If I go and sleep, you come sleep with me

TUMI	No, I don't have bedtime. Remember? You do.

TSHEPO	Okay, fine. Can I drink some milk first, then I'll go to sleep?

TUMI	Oh. Tshepo, what is it with these delay tactics? You never negotiate with your mother when you have to go to bed. Why do you do it with me?

TSHEPO	'Cause Mom says, "I don't negotiate with kids!"

TUMI	Well, I don't negotiate with kids either, so it is time for you to go to bed. Let's go.

KEENAN	Mommy, can I ask you something?

MS JOHNSON	Go ahead, son.

KEENAN	How did my father react when you told him that you were pregnant with me?

MS JOHNSON	Such a deep question so late at night. Why do you wanna talk about such things?

KEENAN	I'm just asking.

MS JOHNSON	Well, he wanted nothing to do with me when I told him I was pregnant. He just disappeared. His family said he had gone to the army.

KEENAN	Oh, I see.

MS JOHNSON	My parents also wanted nothing to do with me. My pregnancy had brought shame to the family name. That's why they sent me to live with my aunt.

KEENAN	But what if he had his reasons for running away?

MS JOHNSON	Well, I hope I raised you to be a better man than that. Not one that will run away after making a girl pregnant.

KEENAN	What if I'm not that guy?

MS JOHNSON	You are. You saw how I struggled to raise you. I don't think you have it in you to put someone through that. Keenan?

KEENAN	Yes.

MS JOHNSON	Is there something you wanna tell me?

KEENAN	Chantel says she's pregnant.

MS JOHNSON	Well, I hope you do the right thing.

MICHAEL	There you go.

TOLI	Thank you.

MICHAEL	I'm so glad you could make it.

TOLI	Thanks for the invite. Wow. You have really outdone yourself, Mr Rembrandt.

MICHAEL	I'm really glad you like it.

MICHAEL	Alright. Okay.

TOLI	Red wine? Are you trying to take advantage of me?

MICHAEL	I'm just trying to take care of you. Want some salad?

TOLI	Yes. Thank you. I come with a lot of baggage, Michael.

MICHAEL	It's a good thing I've got strong arms, I'll help you carry it.

TOLI	I also have a handsome son, you know.

MICHAEL	I love children.

TOLI	Okay, you got me.

MICHAEL	Cheers.

TOLI	Cheers.

MICHAEL	Much better than the office canteen, right?	

TOLI	Much.

SIZWE	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, honey. Let's get you more comfortable.

BUSI	Okay. 

SIZWE	There we go.

BUSI	Oh, thank you.

SIZWE	Ah, there we go.

BUSI	Mmm.

SIZWE	Anything else I can bring?

BUSI	No, no, no, no. Come here.

SIZWE	Okay. 

BUSI	You...

SIZWE	Mm-hm. Okay.

BUSI	have been nothing...

SIZWE	Mm-hm.

BUSI	but loving and caring to me.

BUSI	Thank you.

SIZWE	My love, it's just that I.. I don't want you to think that I don't care because I don't see you every day.

BUSI	No, baby, you see, as soon as we get married, that won't be a problem.

SIZWE	Yes. But you know I'm not ready for that step yet. Juice? Let me bring you some juice.

NTUTHUKO	Hey, Sandy. How're you?

SANDY	Show.

NTUTHUKO	Oh. There it is.

SANDY	You didn't have to bring her textbook all the way here. She needs to be more responsible and not leave her things just lying around.

NTUTHUKO	No, it's okay, Sandy, I don't mind.

SANDY	Well, thank you.

NTUTHUKO	Thank you. Thank you.

SANDY	I'll see you in court.

NTUTHUKO	Court? Sandy! Sandy…

KEENAN	Chantel! Chantel! Okay. Hi. Good morning. Oh. These are for you. Your favourite flowers.

CHANTEL	What are you expecting to happen right now, Keenan?

KEENAN	That you would take the flowers.

CHANTEL	And then?

KEENAN	And then I would tell you that I'm sorry, for everything. And then we would get back together.

CHANTEL	You think this is a soapy, don't you?

KEENAN	Ow!

CHANTEL	Don't come back here again.

TOLI	Tumi, hey. Sorry to keep you waiting. You know how difficult Pickering can be when I need to get out.

TUMI	It's okay. I already took the liberty of ordering your favourite drink for you.

TOLI	Thank you. Listen.. Remember we need to talk.

TUMI	Yes. I told you that I love you a few weeks ago and you still haven't said it back to me.

TOLI	It's not that I don't love you back. I mean, I've known you since I was a teenager. It's just.. I've never had another boyfriend besides you, and I think.. I just wanna see what else is out there.

TUMI	There isn't much out there, though. No. I don't mean it like that. It's just that I know what I want now, Toli. I want you and Tshepo in my life, for good.

TOLI	Yoh. Tumi, there was a time in our lives when I really, really needed to hear those words from you, but those words never came.

TUMI	I know that I hurt you. But I need you in my life, Toli. You and I are at a great place as parents right now.

TOLI	Yeah, I think you are a great father to our son. And we are great friends. Tumi, I spent the last few years chasing you, now, I.. have someone in my life.

TUMI	Is it serious?

TOLI	It's new. I don't know if it will be serious.

NTUTHUKO	Sandy? Sandy, is this perfectly necessary?

SANDY	Would you rather your child goes to bed hungry, Ntuthuko.

NTUTHUKO	Of course not, Sandy, but that's not.. I don't earn enough money to give anymore money.

SANDY	Oh, but you have money for a wedding?

NTUTHUKO	Is this what you brought me here for?

SANDY	Oh, don't flatter yourself.

MAGISTRATE	Okay, quiet now. Why do you need more money, Sandy?

SANDY	Our child has grown, magistrate. There are things that she needs that I can't pay for on my own.

MAGISTRATE	You don't raise kids on things.

NTUTHUKO	Exactly.

MAGISTRATE	Ntuthuko, you're currently paying 1,800 a month.

SANDY	Imagine.

NTUTHUKO	Yes, sir. But I don't earn any more money to give.

MAGISTRATE	You've been paying this amount for the last two years. I think we can increase it to at least 2,200. Will that help?

SANDY	Yes. Yes, of course. Yes, it will, magistrate.

MAGISTRATE	I'll see you back here again 12 months from now. Try not to kill each other before that.

NTUTHUKO	I don't have that money.

SANDY	Yes, you do.

NTUTHUKO	I don't.


SANDY	You do.

MAGISTRATE	Your financial records say you do. Come back next month if he hasn't paid in full.

SANDY	Of cour.. Thank you, I will. Thank you, magistrate.

MAGISTRATE	Hambani.

NTUTHUKO	Sir. Damn. All this...

JOY	Cheers, guys. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, baby. Are you still on your way?

SIZWE	Honey, can you rather come over tomorrow, please? I'm still stuck here in the office.

JOY	Really? Sizwe, seriously?

SIZWE	Hey, come on, I'll make it up to you. I just need to finish this presentation.

JOY	Ag, it's fine. Listen, I've got a call coming through. Let me take it. We'll speak later.

SIZWE	Bye, gorgeous.

JOY	Hello, Joy speaking.

BUSI	This is Busi. Sizwe's girlfriend.

JOY	Excuse me, you're Sizwe's what?

BUSI	The mother of Sizwe's unborn child.

JOY	Excuse me?

BUSI	You heard me right. I just wanted to tell you to just please leave Sizwe alone. I'm expecting a son and doesn't need distractions like you in his life.

MS JOHNSON	Thank you. Please forgive us for coming to your house at this late hour. I knock off late at work.

TA'CHASE	It's alright, so what brings you here?

MS JOHNSON	My son asked me to bring him. He has something to say to your family and your daughter.

KEENAN	I just wanted to say, Mr and Mrs Steyn, that I'm sorry for how I handled things with Chantel. I don't know why I acted the way I did.

TA'CHASE	I don't why you've apologised to me. It's not as if you made me pregnant and forgot somehow to answer my calls.

KEENAN	I'm sorry, Chantel.

TA'CHASE	You hurt my daughter, Keenan.

KEENAN	Yes.

TA'CHASE	And when you hurt my daughter, you hurt me.

KEENAN	I know, sir. I'm sorry.

TA'CHASE	You said that already.

MAM'LIZZIE	Okay, I think Keenan has poured out his heart to Chantel and to us. So, now we need to look at a way forward.

KEENAN	Yes, Mrs Steyn. I want you to know that I will look after your daughter and the baby.

TA'CHASE	I can look after my own daughter. You see, I wasn't overwhelmed by my responsibility as a man.

KEENAN	I know, sir. I will look after the baby.

MS JOHNSON	Thank you for being so understanding.

KEENAN	I still love you.

CHANTEL	I need to go pee.

MAM'LIZZIE	Please help yourself.

MS JOHNSON	Thank you.

SIZWE	Joy? What's going on? What are you doing?

JOY	Don't ask me that. Don't.

SIZWE	What have you done to my place?

JOY	What have I done? What have I done? Sizwe, what have you..? What have you done to my heart?

SIZWE	What are you talking about? The neighbours called the cops. I mean, why on earth would you do something like this?

JOY	Who's Busi?

SIZWE	Who?

JOY	Don't! Don't! Don't lie to me!

SIZWE	Hey! Alright, okay.

JOY	Don't.

SIZWE	Busi.. Busi's just some girl.

JOY	You're lying again. Oh, Busi is just some girl. Some girl that's pregnant. Pregnant with your baby, my Sizwe, my Sizwe. She's pregnant with your baby. You think I'm a fool. How many times, Sizwe? How many times have you beaten me up in this place? And nobody's called the cops. Nobody. I come here and break just a few plates, look behind you. Look behind you. They come running in. Get out of my way. Get out!

SIZWE	Joy, relax.

JOY	Shut up and get out of my way! Arrest me, please. And you be a gentleman, and grab my shoes and my bag.

KEENAN	I said all I could say to your parents. But honestly, baby, I was stupid.

CHANTEL	Are you trying to get me to feel sorry for you, Keenan?

KEENAN	No, not like that. I really want to be involved with the baby. But I also want you back.

CHANTEL	You think I'm an alarm clock who can switch on and off as you please?

KEENAN	No. I want to prove myself to you. Just give me one last chance, please.

CHANTEL	Keenan.. But you...

KEENAN	You can even call it off in the end. But I want you to know that I've given it my all. Please.

TOLI	I don't know, I mean.. I think sometimes things start out good, but then something happens and all that goodness disappears.

MICHAEL	Yeah, but I think then there was no goodness to begin with.

TOLI	I'm scared you'll break my heart, Michael.

MICHAEL	I'm scared you'll break my heart, but I wanna take the risk anyway.

TOLI	I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready for something serious.

MICHAEL	I'm ready for all of you, Toli. You turn my life upside down in the best possible way. I want something serious with you and Tshepo.

TOLI	Sorry.

MICHAEL	Okay. 

TOLI	Hello?

JOY	I'm at the Randburg police station.

TOLI	Joy? Joy, hello?

MICHAEL	What's wrong?

TOLI	Um.. Joy's at the police station. I'm sorry, I have to go. What are you doing? Where are you going?

MICHAEL	I'm coming with you. I'll grab your stuff from the kitchen.

TOLI	Thanks.

TOLI	There she is. Joy? Hey.

JOY	I'm so sorry, Toli.

TOLI	It's okay, friend. It's okay.

JOY	You warned me about Sizwe, everyone warned me about Sizwe. I didn't listen.

TOLI	You love him, friend.

JOY	Not anymore.

TOLI	What happened?

JOY	Toli, you know how much I wanted that man's baby. And then he goes and he gets another women pregnant.

TOLI	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

JOY	I'm so stupid.

TOLI	No, no. No.

TOLI	THE "HOW COULD YOU" STAGE OF BEING A BABY MAMA, IS A TOUGH ONE TO FIND YOURSELF IN. YOU REALISE THAT THE SIGNS THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WON'T WORK HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE. WHEN THE SHIT HITS THE FAN, YOU'RE FORCED TO LOOK AT YOUR RELATIONSHIP THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS.

MICHAEL	So, he won't press charges.

TOLI	I'm glad. Let's go home. Yeah? Please help me, thanks. There you go.

MICHAEL	Thanks guys.

KEENAN	Hi, how's it, babe? Sorry I'm late. What time is our appointment?

CHANTEL	Any time now.

KEENAN	Okay, cool.

RECEPTIONIST	Chantel Steyn, the doctor will see you now.

CHANTEL	Thank you.

KEENAN	Give me your bag. 

DOCTOR	There you go, just a few more weeks to go.

CHANTEL	Thank you, Doctor.

DOCTOR	You're welcome.

KEENAN	I think he looks like me.

CHANTEL	No, he doesn't. 

DOCTOR	I think you're right, I think he looks exactly like you. Do me a favour, take very good care of Chantel and that baby until I see you again, okay?

KEENAN	Okay, Doctor. I told you.

CHANTEL	Yeah, thank you.

DOCTOR	Thanks, guys.

JOY	These wine glasses, yours are nicer.

TOLI	Girl, you know I got style. 

JOY	I know. I'm so hungry.

TOLI	As always we're waiting for Sandy.

JOY	The way she likes to diss me about running late.	

TOLI	It's 'cause you always late, friend. Cheers for being early.

JOY	No, that's not true. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, actually.

SANDY	Askies, askies, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

TOLI	Mm-hm. Hello, baby.

JOY	Finally, wena. 

SANDY	Ladies.

JOY	Hello! 

SANDY	I'm so glad Chantel is not here yet. I wanted to check if we can have a baby shower for her?

JOY	Hm. That's nice.

TOLI	I don't know why I didn't think of that. That's a great idea.

JOY	Hm.

SANDY	But I was thinking, neh. We have it more intimate.

JOY	Uh-uh. Intimate? Sandy, for a baby shower? Come on.

SANDY	Yeah. Eya. Maybe we can have a weekend away. Guys, we've been talking about going to Harties. We never got around to doing it. This is the time. Neh?

TOLI	That's true.

JOY	Ja, and we could all use a weekend away, hey?

TOLI	So badly.

JOY	Hm.

SANDY	But wait, there's more.

TOLI	Always.

JOY	Oh, jeez. 

SANDY	Guys, give me a chance. I was thinking, we keep it as a surprise, neh. Until that very last minute.

JOY	Girl, why you so addicted to complicating things?

TOLI	I actually like it. Yes.

SANDY	Ah, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

JOY	No. No. Seriously?

TOLI	Yes, yes, yes. Joy.

JOY	I like the concept of a weekend away, but now like the complications of...

TOLI	Road trip. Road trip. Road trip, road trip. You know you wanna.

SANDY	Road trip. Road trip. Road trip, road trip. Road trip. Road trip.

JOY	Majority rules. Road trip.

TUMI	That's fine.

TSHEPO	So, Dad.. Are you and Mommy gonna get married someday?

TUMI	I don't know.

TSHEPO	Why? 

TUMI	I don't know why, Tshepo.

TSHEPO	Why don't you know? Mommy is pretty.

TUMI	I know that Mommy's pretty. I just don't think that it will be a good idea for Mommy and I to get married right now.

TSHEPO	Then you need to find a girlfriend, Daddy.	

TUMI	Ah, Tshepo.

CHANTEL	Hello, ladies.

TOLI	Come, come, come, oh, my gosh. Oh, tsomponontso. He's so big now.

SANDY	Look at that cute nose. Oh, my.. Oh, my God. Oh, you did good.

JOY	Come I see. Mommy's nose. Chantel, Daddy's eyes, he's gonna be a heartbreaker.

CHANTEL	No! He better not be. So, I haven't seen you ladies in a while.

SANDY	I know.

JOY	Hi! 

CHANTEL	But I'm glad to see y'all are still dedicated to drinking wine.

TOLI	Yes.

JOY	Oh, yes. You know it. Of course.

SANDY	And I'm drinking extra today.

CHANTEL	Ntuthuko? 

TOLI	He's getting married to his girlfriend.

CHANTEL	Sorry.

SANDY	I don't understand why he has to marry her. You know? And why must my daughter be at that wedding?

JOY	Sandy, you're gonna have to get it, hey? He's marrying her because he loves her.

SANDY	I mean, you guys know deep down, I thought we could work things out. You know?

TOLI	You need to let it go, friend.

JOY/CHANTEL	Mm.

SANDY	Oh, it's not that easy, Toli.

TOLI	I know. I know.

SANDY	And then there's Samuel. He's been MIA lately.

SANDY	Every time we make plans he just cancels at the last minute.

JOY	Mm-mm. Uh-uh. You're also just a mountain of issues. Isn't it that you wanted him because he's unavailable. Generally, that's what married men do, they just don't leave the house because you want them. No.

JOY	It's not how it works.

TOLI	Ah.

JOY	You know, I find when I give you ladies advice, the sun shines on me. And the day becomes nicer. Feels like a better day. Don't you see it?

JOY	True story the glow, you don't see it?

TOLI	Mm.

SANDY	Thank you, libanditi.

JOY	Oh, wow. 

SANDY	I hear you wanna be Minister of Correctional Services now.

JOY	What did you expect me to do though?

TOLI	Hlayos.

JOY	You know he deserved it.

CHANTEL	But what's the point? You're gonna get back together with him anyway.

JOY	Mm-mm.

SANDY	Really?

JOY	No. Nope. Not this time around. I'm so over Sizwe and his nonsense. Like, so done with it.

CHANTEL	So, babes, you're gonna go cold turkey.

CHANTEL	But I thought you said his machine is the.. Eish.

JOY	Don't get it twisted. He give it good. He lay it down thick and nice, but no, thank you. I'm, like, totally over him. And I truly believe that there's good men out there.

SANDY	Mm, there are. And they're all after Toli over here.

JOY	True story.

SANDY	Tumi and Michael have her on a high.

JOY	Look at her. Look at this.

TOLI	I actually told Tumi about Michael.

JOY	You lie.

CHANTEL	And? How did he react?

TOLI	Eish, girl.

JOY	Nobody cares. Nobody cares. You need to give it up to Michael and stop kissing each other on the cheeks. Please.

SANDY	Hallelujah.

JOY	You need it. Right?

CHANTEL	Please. Please.

SANDY	You know I never agree with anything she says but this time...

JOY	Finally. Same Whatsapp group.

TOLI	THE LAST STAGE OF BEING A BABY MAMA IS WHERE I FIND MYSELF, THE "I LOVE YOU BUT I CAN'T BE WITH YOU" STAGE. TUMI AND I GET ALONG WELL, BUT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH WITH HIM TO KNOW THAT I COULD NEVER GO BACK TO BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. IT JUST WOULDN'T WORK. WE ARE BETTER AS FRIENDS AND AS CO-PARENTS.

TOLI	And? Why is it so quiet here?

TUMI	Shh.

TUMI	He passed out. I was actually gonna call you and ask if it's okay if you pick him up tomorrow instead?

TOLI	Yeah, that's fine, he can sleep over tonight.

TUMI	Maybe.. Maybe you can too.

TOLI	Stop it, Tumi. You know I'm seeing someone.

TUMI	Ja. Juice?

TOLI	Mm-hm. You know, at some point, our son will have to meet the people we date.

TUMI	Yeah, don't remind me. He was actually asking me why are we not married?

TOLI	No. What did you say?

TUMI	Nothing much. But he did tell me to get a girlfriend.

TOLI	He's right, you know.

TUMI	I know he's right. Some day.

TOLI	So, I've never introduced another man to Tshepo before.

TUMI	Yes?

TOLI	So, how do I do it?

TUMI	So you want to introduce your new man to Tshepo.

TOLI	Yeah.

TUMI	And.. you're asking me how to do it?

TOLI	Yes.

TUMI	How am I supposed to know?

TOLI	Well, you're a guy, and you're his father. Do you think he's ready for something like that?

TUMI	I think he can handle it. He's a smart boy. But as to how you're supposed to do it, look, Toli, I don't wanna lose my street cred now.

TOLI	Street cred?

TUMI	Yes.

TOLI	You've never had any. That's why. Even your son wants you to get a girlfriend. He's worried about your street cred.

TUMI	Well, last I checked, my street cred worked perfectly well on you.

TUMI	Mm.

SANDY	This is you...

JOY	Girls! It's done. The booking for the getaway.

TOLI	Oh!

JOY	Yes.

SANDY	So you'll let us know what to bring in terms of food, drinks, decor...

TOLI	I'll get in touch with Chantel's mom, ask her to pack her bags for her.

JOY	Fantastic.

TOLI	Yes.

JOY	And then we're gonna have to get her out of the chalet for a few hours so we can prep the room for the baby shower.

TOLI	It's cool, we'll make a plan.

SANDY	Yay!

WOMEN	Ah!

JOY	Alrighty, lots to do, gotta go. Thanks, bye.

SANDY	My tea.

TOLI	It's okay.

MICHAEL	I don't suppose I can pop in on this weekend away?

TOLI	Absolutely no boys allowed. 

MICHAEL	Okay, what if I drove you there?

TOLI	Nice try, Michael. Tumi's giving me his car for the weekend. Mine is too small for all of us.

MICHAEL	Taking your ex's car?

TOLI	Ja, he always gives it to me when I need it.

MICHAEL	He's the reason you can't get serious with me, isn't it?

TOLI	No. It's not that. And I am serious about us.

MICHAEL	I don't think so. I mean, you could have asked for my car, you didn't.

TOLI	I...

MICHAEL	See what I mean? He's still the first person you go to when you need help. That really hurts. Food's ready. Sorry, I've lost my appetite.

TOLI	Michael.

SANDY	No.

SERVER	Good evening, ma'am.

SANDY	Hi.

SANDY	Ah, you're not Samuel.

SERVER	It was pre-ordered, ma'am. Thank you, have a great evening.

SANDY	Thank you.

SERVER	Thank you.

CHANTEL	Mommy?

MAM'LIZZIE	Mm?

CHANTEL	Why are your bags packed? Where are you going?

MAM'LIZZIE	Nowhere.

CHANTEL	What do you mean?

MAM'LIZZIE	What were you doing in my room anyway?	

CHANTEL	I stay here, remember?	

MAM'LIZZIE	Huh. You know, you ask too many questions.

CHANTEL	Does Daddy know your bags are packed?

MAM'LIZZIE	There you go, asking questions again.

JOY/TOLI	Hey. Hello.

CHANTEL	What are you girls doing here?

JOY	Well, we're here to fetch you.

TOLI	Yes.

SANDY	Are her bags packed?

MAM'LIZZIE	I'll go and get them.

CHANTEL	Mommy, you were in on this?

TOLI	We're going on a girls weekend away.

CHANTEL	But, girls...

SANDY	Don't worry, everything is sorted out. You stress too much.

MAM'LIZZIE	Oh, here we go.

TOLI	Oh, thank you, Mam'Lizzie.

JOY	Let me get those bags.

SANDY	Thank you.

CHANTEL	Did you pack my toothbrush? Did you pack my vitamins?

JOY	She's your mom, she has you covered. Thanks, ma, bye.

MAM'LIZZIE	Bye.

SANDY	Hello, sir. Thank you, sir.

CHANTEL	Stop it now, Joy.

SANDY	Thank you.

JOY	Mm, to watch you walk away.

SANDY	Take it off.

JOY	Gosh.. before I hurt myself. So how's it going with Michael?

TOLI	Michael is great, but...

JOY	But what?

TOLI	He's being so childish. He got upset because I told him Tumi gave me the car for the weekend.

CHANTEL	Okay. So how would you feel if Michael was giving his ex-girlfriend his car for the weekend?

TOLI	It's not the same thing.

JOY	Uh-uh. See that's where you get it wrong totally, it's exactly the same thing.

TOLI	What if Tshepo doesn't like Michael and visa-versa?

SANDY	Oh, my.. how did we go from a car to Michael and Tshepo not liking each other?

JOY	Hai, mm-mm.

TOLI	Guys, I'm scared to introduce a new man into my son's life.

JOY	Yeah.

TOLI	Michael doesn't have a child. You guys know, my son comes first.

CHANTEL	Babes, it's normal to be scared.

JOY	Mm, and at some point, Toli, you're gonna have to trust that, it's all gonna work out in the end.

CHANTEL	Exactly. Look at my mom and I. We love each other, most people don't even know that she's my step mom. And to make it sweeter, she doesn't have kids of her own.

TOLI	I don't know.

JOY	Also, look at Sandy and Ntuthuko. Thandiwe really likes Ntuthuko's new girlfriend. Right, Sands?

SANDY	Well, she does.

CHANTEL	It could work out for Michael and Tshepo. You just have to be upfront with your son and don't make him feel like he's not part of your new journey.

JOY	Also, Toli, try not make him choose between the two men. You guys have been doing really great at the co-parenting thing. Friend, don't mess it up, hey.

TOLI	I hear you. You guys are right.

SANDY	We always are.

TOLI	Ha!

JOY	I only have on question though,.

TOLI	Mm-hm?

JOY	A white guy?

TOLI	It is not my fault he's into chocolate, okay.	

JOY	Oh, goodness, oh, my gosh. Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

SANDY	How are things with you, Chantel?

CHANTEL	Better. Keenan thinks we back together.

TOLI	And? Are you?

JOY	Are you?

CHANTEL	I guess. I'm learning to forgive and not forget.

TOLI	You know your situation reminded me of when Tumi said he wasn't the father of our child. I didn't know it was possible to feel that much pain. But I'm glad Keenan came to his senses sooner than Tumi did.

SANDY	Mm-hm. Mm.

CHANTEL	I think he just got scared.

SANDY	I think they forget that we are just as scared as they are. Except we can't run away.

TOLI	Yeah.

JOY	You guys will never guess who's been calling me.

SANDY	Who?

JOY	I said, guess, Sandy.

TOLI	Well, it can't be Sizwe, so...

JOY	Well...

SANDY	Well, what?

JOY	Well, Sizwe's been calling.

SANDY	Joy, you just can't seem to say no to this man.

TOLI	What does he want?

JOY	I don't know. I have not been taking his calls.

SANDY	Don't lie, we wont judge you.

JOY	I swear, I have nothing to say to that man.

CHANTEL	Do you still want him back?

TOLI	Joy. You want him back?

JOY	That's not what I said.

CHANTEL	Babes, you didn't have to say a thing.

JOY	Seriously, I don't want Sizwe back. I am done with that man.

SANDY	Then what did he say?

JOY	I don't know, I've not been taking his calls.

CHANTEL	Guys, maybe he just wants to apologise.

SANDY	Oh, Chantel, sweet, sweet, Chantel. This is how you fell pregnant. USizwe is not the apologising type.

TOLI	He is not.

TOLI	Some with milk?

CHANTEL	Please.

CHANTEL	Anybody see the sugar?

JOY	Chantel, please get the door.

EVELYN	Hello.

JOY	Hi, Evelyn.

TOLI	Good morning.

JOY	Bye, Evelyn. Bye.

SANDY	Thank you, Evelyn.

SANDY	Bye-bye.

JOY	She wouldn't leave. Let's do it.

TOLI	Decor. Let's go.

JOY	Oh, oh, almost there. Almost there.

SANDY	There she is. There she is.

JOY	Come in!

ALL	Surprise!

CHANTEL	You guys are the sweetest!

TOLI	Come, come, come, come, come.

SANDY	Take a seat.

TOLI	Come, come, come.

SANDY	Sit.

CHANTEL	Why didn't you guys tell me?

SANDY	Because then it wouldn't have been a surprise, Chantel. Would it?

JOY	Would you like something to drink, Chantel?

TOLI	Maybe you can have some water!

JOY	Sure.

CHANTEL	Yes, please.

TOLI	Pass my drink to me.

SANDY	Mine too, please.

JOY	No problem. So I think I should have been a bartender, 'cause watch my skill. Watch my skill.

SANDY	Yes!

JOY	I slay.

TOLI	All day.

TOLI/JOY	All day!

TOLI	Yes.

JOY	No tray...

JOY	Here you go.

TOLI	Thank you.

JOY	Here's yours.


SANDY	Okay, start..

JOY	Put...

SANDY	What?

JOY	Put the gift down. Sandy, put the gift down. She suppose to guess, you're ruining it.

SANDY	Sheesh.

JOY	Take.. put the gift down. Take your drink.

SANDY	I completely forgot.. I'm so sorry, Minister of baby showers.

JOY	Stop acting like you don't know what baby showers are about.

TOLI	It's okay, ladies, how about we all start with a short message from each one of us to Chantel and the baby and then she can open the gifts in her own time.

SANDY	Okay, I'll start. To Chantel and.. We don't know the baby's name.

JOY	Actually.

CHANTEL	So, guys, Keenan and I decided to keep the baby's name a secret until the baby's born.

SANDY	What? Okay. It's fine, it's her day.

TOLI	Yes.

SANDY	Okay. Alright, to Chantel, ooh, I wish you well on this journey to motherhood. You will cry, you will laugh, but most of all, you will love like you've never loved before. To the baby with no name yet, I cant wait to meet you!

TOLI	Oh, well done, aunty Sandy.

JOY	So sweet. Okay, so I'll go next. So obviously I don't have a baby. Right. But what I want to say to you, Chantel, is.. please, don't deprive yourself of a sex life because of that baby that's growing in your belly...

TOLI	Joy!

JOY	What?

TOLI	Do you have another message for Chantel and the baby?

JOY	Maybe. Yeah. Its a very important message. It is. Have you seen how deprived they are? Have you seen how depressed they are? That is because they deprive themselves of a sex life so do not deprive Keenan of his baby daddy duties. Don't do it. Don't do it. And don't make another one.

TOLI	Thank you, Joy. Thank you. Thank you. Well...	

SANDY	Who invited you?

JOY	Oh, don't.

TOLI	Apologies for our strange friend. My turn, my turn. Chantel, you came into our lives for a reason. You make us laugh. You've allowed all of us to be big sisters to you. So I just wanna say, we love you and the baby. And you must always remember that we'll be here for you no matter what.

SANDY	Aww.

JOY	Girl!

CHANTEL	Thank you, guys.

JOY	I love you, guys.

TOLI	You guys are the best.

TOLI	Wow.

SANDY	What is happening?

JOY	Oh, my goodness.

CHANTEL	Good morning.

TOLI	Good morning.

SANDY	Good morning.

JOY	Morning.

TOLI	You have been busy.

JOY	This looks so beautiful.

CHANTEL	Darling.

JOY	It's amazing.

CHANTEL	Have a seat now.

JOY	So hungry.

SANDY	Mm.

JOY	Wow, this is gorgeous, sho.

CHANTEL	So, I just wanted to thank you ladies for this weekend.

CHANTEL	I really appreciate you.

TOLI	Friend, you didn't have to make us breakfast, you're pregnant.

CHANTEL	Pregnant, not ill.

JOY	Exactly. What, were you gonna make us breakfast, Toli?

TOLI	No.

JOY	Thank you, so, allow Chantel to flourish in serving the queendom. Thank you.

SANDY	What she said.

JOY	Mm.

CHANTEL	On that note, I'd like to make a toast. To the amazing women in my life, may we find true love, may we appreciate it once we have it,

TOLI	Mm.

CHANTEL	and may we never, ever, ever, settle for less.

TOLI	Mm.

JOY	Here, here! Cheers.

TOLI	Wait for me. Wait for me. Wait for me.

JOY	This is so good. Mm.

TOLI	Mm. Can we dig in?

CHANTEL	Mm-hm. Dig in.

TOLI	Yes!

JOY	This is so good. I think I'm gonna have champagne for breakfast.

JOY	Won't you please pass me those. Thank you.

TOLI	think I am going to tell Michael how I feel. I really, really like him. I wanna see where this relationship will end up.

JOY	I'm so glad. I'm so, so glad you're finally coming to your senses. It's good.

SANDY	I think I'm gonna let Ntuthuko go.

TOLI	What?

SANDY	It's time, guys. How else will I find true love?

CHANTEL	Guys, I think I'm going to forgive Keenan.

JOY	Aw.

CHANTEL	Give our relationship another chance. Obviously not rush anything, but it's worth it.

SANDY	Good for you.

JOY	I think I'm gonna close the Sizwe chapter for good. I think my only regret is that I didn't listen to you ladies sooner.

SANDY	Come here. Come. Come. Come.

JOY	Thank you.

TOLI	Look, they're cute.

TOLI	Mr Rembrandt.

MICHAEL	Hey, Toli.

TOLI	Hey.

MICHAEL	How was your weekend?

TOLI	It was good. Really good. Can I sit?

MICHAEL	Ja.

TOLI	Thanks.

TOLI	I'm sorry. I get it now.

MICHAEL	I'm listening.

TOLI	I was scared. Of letting you in my life. Of introducing you to my son.

MICHAEL	What about now?

TOLI	I'm still scared, but I'm doing it anyway. Michael, you're my man, and I want us to be serious.

MICHAEL	You sure?

TOLI	Well, that's if you haven't found another girl?

MICHAEL	Well, not as sexy as you. Toli, I really wanna me Tshepo, but there's something I need to do first, that's very important.

TOLI	Okay.

MICHAEL	First give me some love.

TOLI	WE CAN'T ALWAYS CONTROL EVERYTHING. SOME THINGS WILL HAPPEN THE WAY THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.

MICHAEL	Tumi, how's it? Michael.

TUMI	Hi. Tumi.

MICHAEL	Nice to meet you. Have a seat. Can I get you a coffee or something? A cappuccino?

TUMI	Coffee's fine.

MICHAEL	Can I get some coffees, please, brother.

SANDY	What province is Cape Town in?

THANDIWE	Western Cape.

SANDY	Write it down.

THANDIWE	Are you going to leave tonight, Mommy?

SANDY	No, my love, I'm not going anywhere. Right, and what province is Durban in?

THANDIWE	KZN.

SANDY	Up top.

TOLI	OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO OUR OWN HANDS.

CHANTEL	Such a beautiful evening, hey?

KEENAN	Ja, it is. So are you okay? I guess you're not that.. that hungry.

CHANTEL	Keenan, what's with the balloons?

KEENAN	Well, I didn't think you liked flowers that much.

CHANTEL	Sense of humour, neh? Keenan? What are you doing?

KEENAN	Look, I know I haven't been the perfect guy to you, but you have been perfection to me. You've changed my life around. You've made me into a man that I never thought I could be. You are the mother of my child, and I love you, Chantel, with my whole heart. I want to love you everyday going forward. Will you marry me?

CHANTEL	Keenan, I do love you, with my whole heart. We've been through some stuff together, but we're still standing. I don't want us to get married because I'm pregnant, I want us to get married because we can't live without each other. Ask me again in a few months from now, when you are sure that you're doing this for the right reasons, and not because you feel pressured in doing the right thing just because I'm pregnant.

KEENAN	But I do love you.

CHANTEL	Babes, I know, but this is not how I imagined it. Keenan, I want the fairly tale, not when I'm feeling like a whale.

TOLI	BUT WHATEVER DECISION WE MAKE HAS TO PUT OUR CHILDREN FIRST AND MAKE THEM HAPPY.

MAM'SONTO	Here you go, my boy. Have some tea. Thank you. So, wedding is this weekend.

NTUTHUKO	Yeah, yeah. We're very excited.

MAM'SONTO	I can imagine. It's all Thandiwe talks about.

NTUTHUKO	I hope I haven't upset Sandy too much.

MAM'SONTO	Oh, don't worry about my daughter. She's stronger than you think. She'll be fine.. eventually.

NTUTHUKO	Ma, you know this wasn't my intention, right? I didn't mean for, you know, for me and Sandy to work out the way we did. That's not what I wanted.

MAM'SONTO	My boy, you really don't have to apologise to me.

THANDIWE	Hello, Daddy.

NTUTHUKO	Hey, monster.

THANDIWE	Can I go put this in your car? Is it locked?

NTUTHUKO	No, no, no. Come, give me a squeeze.

THANDIWE	Car keys, Daddy?

NTUTHUKO	No. It's not locked. Somebody is inside..in the car.

THANDIWE	Bye, Mommy. Bye, Gogo.

MAM'SONTO	Bye.

SANDY	It's her, isn't it? In the car?

MAM'SONTO	Sandy, come on.

NTUTHUKO	We had so many errands, we had so much work that we had to do.. What are you doing, Sandy? Sandy. Listen, Sandy, what..? Okay, wait. Sandy! Sandy. Sandy. Sandy. Sandy.

THANDIWE	Mama, please don't do this.

NTUTHUKO	What are you doing anyway, Sandy?

SANDY	Hi.

KHETHI	Hi.

SANDY	I'm Thandiwe's mom. I'm Sandy.

KHETHI	Hi, I'm Khethi, I'm Ntuthuko's fiance.

SANDY	I figured I should come and introduce myself, since my daughter spends quite a bit of time at your place, and when she's there, you take care of her.

KHETHI	Oh, she's.. We love having her. She's fantastic.

NTUTHUKO	A star.

SANDY	You should ask her to give you my number. For anything and everything pertaining to her.

KHETHI	Oh, okay. I'll do that.

SANDY	I hope you're not too stressed.. about the wedding.

KHETHI	Oh, a little bit.

NTUTHUKO	It's fine. It's great.

SANDY	All the best, sis.

KHETHI	Thank you. Thank you so much.

SANDY	Tha. Don't forget to give Aunty Khethi my number.

THANDIWE	I will, Ma. Love you.

SANDY	I love you, too.

NTUTHUKO	Thank you. Ma. 

TOLI	Yoh. 

SANDY	How did this happen?

JOY	I don't know.

CHANTEL	Guys, what's going on, here?

SANDY	Shh!

CHANTEL	Oh. What are you going to do?

JOY	I'm going to keep it.

TOLI	Okay. Okay, okay. Are you going to tell Sizwe?

JOY	I don't know, maybe.

TOLI	Maybe. It's going to be rough. Okay.

SANDY	Joy, are you happy?

TOLI	AND JOY DID BECOME A BABY MAMA AFTER ALL!

SANDY	You're gonna be a mommy. You're gonna be a mommy. You're gonna be a mom. Okay. Alright, alright. You do know now you gonna have to start answering Sizwe's calls and.. Right?

TOLI	Oh!

SANDY	Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, there's two! Hello, baba. Hello, baba. Aunty Sandy's your favourite, Aunty Sandy's your favourite, Aunty Sandy's your favourite, Aunty Sandy's your favourite...

TOLI	Michael, hi. Come on in. Hey.

MICHAEL	How are you?


TOLI	Good. Good. Thank you. Nana, I'd like you to come meet Uncle Michael.

TSHEPO	Hello, Uncle Michael, I'm Tshepo.

MICHAEL	Hey, buddy. I've heard so much about you. So, it's him. I got you something.

TSHEPO	Thank you, Uncle Michael.

TOLI	So you think bribery will help?

MICHAEL	It's a racing car, it should.

TSHEPO	Uncle Michael, please can you help me?

TOLI	Go on, Uncle Michael.

MICHAEL	I'll sit down here. Let's see what we got.

TOLI	AS A BABY MAMA, THE MOST IMPORTANT HUMAN BEING IN YOUR LIFE IS THE ONE YOU GAVE BIRTH TO. WHILE STILL TRYING TO MOVE ON AND PURSUE YOUR OWN HAPPINESS. IT'S A JOURNEY THAT WILL MAKE YOU FACE YOUR BIGGEST FEARS AND TEACH YOU YOUR BEST LIFE LESSONS. AND THAT IS, BEING A BABY MAMA IS HARD. FINDING LOVE AS A BABY MAMA IS HARDER.
