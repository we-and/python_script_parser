MAN	This post-[inaudible] mess has got to go away for your daughter's sake.

POLICE OFFICER	You're under arrest for the murder of Chantel Broussard.

MAN	Oh, oh.

BOJOHN	What the hell am I doing?

MAN	Do not interfere with that band in any way, shape, or form.

DANNY	Go! Go!

MAN	You can do this. Come on. 

MAN	Go for it, man. Come on. Let's go! Let's go. Get it up.

MAN	Let's go.

MAN	You got it. You got it. Let's go.

MAN	Yeah, let's go, Bo. Let's go, Bo. Let's go, Bo.

MAN	No, you ain't got it.

BOJOHN	Whoo!

EVA	In less than a week, Crawford State University's fifth-ranked football team comes to town. That means every alum, donor, journalist, and politician from here to Savannah will parade across this quad. We must be perfect, grass cut, walls painted, bleachers so clean you can eat steak off the seats.

CREW SUPERVISOR	Sydney Fletcher?

SYDNEY	Good morning.

CREW SUPERVISOR	Nice outfit.

SYDNEY	Mm. Thank you.

CREW SUPERVISOR	Devon Shepherd?

DANNY	Watch your lines. Watch your lines. Pull out. Pull out.

DANNY	Mountain Cats don't miss steps, freshman. Kiara, please demonstrate.  One, two, ready, and.

DANNY	Perfect. Excellent. You have less than 72 hours to get your two left feet right, or your lame ass is out. From the top. 

TIESHA	Welcome to "Mountain Cats Corner," Coach.

COACH HARDWICK	Thanks. Good to talk to you.

TIESHA	So the first game of the season is just days away, and you're 0 and three in season openers. Are you feeling the pressure to win this one?

COACH HARDWICK	We try to win all of our games.

TIESHA	Yeah, well, CSU, they're a 20-point favorite, and they have Lamar Oaks, the All-Amer—

COACH HARDWICK	All-American linebacker and Heisman candidate, I know.

TIESHA	Do you know why Mountain Cats fans should still have any hope?

COACH HARDWICK	Look, we just had the best spring and summer since I got here, and our guys believe in themselves, plus the stands are gonna be packed with fans who believe in them too, ride or die.

TIESHA	Going with the 12th man thing?

COACH HARDWICK	Yes, ma'am. Hope to see you there. Thank you for your time.

TIESHA	Just one more question, are you planning on starting Terrence Berry or BoJohn Folsom at quarterback?

COACH HARDWICK	Don't know yet.

TIESHA	Come on, Coach. Are you gonna go with the veteran or the former five-star recruit?

COACH HARDWICK	The quarterback that gives us the best chance to win will start.

TIESHA	Makes CSU have to prepare for both, I see you, Coach.

COACH HARDWICK	Have a good day, Tiesha.

TIESHA	Thank you for being on "Mountain Cats Corner," Coach.

EVA	(knocking) Interview notwithstanding, you are starting BoJohn?

COACH HARDWICK	How'd you know about the interview?

EVA	I try to know what's important to know. I wanted to offer moral support. Why are you answering questions with questions?

COACH HARDWICK	Because it's my decision, Eva.

EVA	I didn't say it wasn't, but we didn't drive all the way down to Texas for that kid to be riding the pine.

COACH HARDWICK	We aren't the coach of this football team.

EVA	Let's try this again. Good morning, Coach. Looks like all the pub Diamond orchestrated to screw me over for recruiting Bo has broadcasters curious.

COACH HARDWICK	I don’t follow.

EVA	If we're good TV this Saturday, someone may be interested in airing all our games.

COACH HARDWICK	I don't see a network doing the HBCU game 'cause we got some guy who was a big deal in high school.

EVA	You didn't think I could get the hazing rules changed either, but I did, quickly. I'm going to find us a network deal, and BoJohn's going to help me.

COACH HARDWICK	You're not. No, this ain't breaking down no barriers. Plenty of our students are white. Hampton just had a white homecoming queen.

EVA	Biracial, white and Asian, but maybe you enjoy playing second fiddle to the band director.

COACH HARDWICK	No, you're not gonna bait me like that. I don't give a damn about Diamond. You're the one who's locked in a death match with him.

EVA	Just trust me and start BoJohn.

COACH HARDWICK	Look, I like BoJohn, but Terrence is talented, and the competition from BoJohn has got him balling out.

EVA	We need a narrative. That big, good-looking kid from Texas with a comeback story gives us one.	

COACH HARDWICK	BoJohn wants the quarterback position, he's got to take it.

EVA	Need I remind you that just last week the water was turned off at the school? Even one of the late-night guys was making jokes about us. Yeah, that's really funny until we wind up unemployed.

COACH HARDWICK	(sighs)

EVA	It's your team, but I promise you, you let BoJohn do his thing, and we'll be able to do ours. Have a productive day, Coach.

CHRYSTAL	So sorry I wasn't here when you got in, ma'am.

EVA	More car trouble?

CHRYSTAL	It won't happen again. The mechanic said I just need a little

EVA	No, it won't happen again because I'm putting you in the university car. I'll drive my own.

CHRYSTAL	N-no, ma'am, thank you, but you don't need to do that.

EVA	No, it's not for you. It's for me. Now, why are you looking so nervous?

CHRYSTAL	Oh, uh, Lila Standrich from the DA's office is here. Are we in trouble?

EVA	(sighs) Would you mind making me a cup of chamomile tea?

CHRYSTAL	Of course.

EVA	And I suggest you drink a cup too. The D.A.'s work is never done, huh?

LILA	Deputy D.A.

EVA	You know, it's good to see you, but I'm seriously underwater right now.

LILA	We are cutting Cedric Hobbs loose. I saw you in the media about it and thought you would want to control the story.

EVA	He is not a story, Lila. He is a young black man who was presumed guilty.

LILA	Probable cause was circumstantial, but it was there. Look, the point is we investigated further and ruled him out.

EVA	Excuse me.

LILA	Are you with me?

EVA	Oh, of course. Thank you. Tea?

LILA	No, thank you. So Hobbs is being processed as we speak. He should be released this afternoon.

EVA	But he still has an arrest record, Lila. That guarantees even more suspicion and harassment from law enforcement for the rest of his life. Where's the justice in that?

LILA	Well, now, if I thought like that, I couldn't do my job, hmm? Look, Eva, I see a Cedric Hobbs or two every day.

EVA	Or you don't see him because to you and the system, a young, black Cedric Hobbs is an invisible man, more profiled than perceived.

LILA	I'm doing all I can.

EVA	Thank you, Lila. I should have said that first.

LILA	Yeah, you should have.

JUNIOR	What'd I tell you, bro? She hella scrumptious.

BOJOHN	Go again. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

JUNIOR	You're welcome.

BOTH	(laugh)

BOJOHN	Oh. Dad, hey. Everything all right?

BEN	Some law against surprising my son?

BOJOHN	No. This is my roommate, Junior.

JUNIOR	Nice to meet you, Mr. Folsom.

BEN	Hello.

BOJOHN	Junior's our left tackle, grew up in Little Rock.

BEN	Well, isn't that something? 

JUNIOR	Hey, I'ma let you all visit. I'm gonna get up out of here.

BOJOHN	Okay.

BEN	This door work?

BOJOHN	Yeah.

BEN	Well, why is it still open? You weren't raised in a barn.

BOJOHN	Yes, sir.

BEN	Look here, I've been making calls. Folks are getting their mind right about you, willing to take a look since you're gonna be on TV and all.

BOJOHN	I'm trying not to think about all that, just hoping to play, you know?

BEN	No, I don't know. Only reason you're here is to get seen on that field. A televised game could be our ticket out.

BOJOHN	But I just started here.

BEN	To show you don't belong in the nuthouse and to keep your legs fresh, that's all.

BOJOHN	I mean, I know that's what you said. It's pretty competitive, and I met some good guys too

BEN	You ain't here to make friends, boy! A good game will go a long way to getting you out of Colored U. (laughs) Play our hands right, Alabama, Oklahoma, serious football powers will be back to banging on our door again.

BOJOHN	That's the plan.

BEN	That's our plan. You hungry?

BOJOHN	Not really.

BEN	Yeah, man, let's go get something to eat.

CHRYSTAL	Oh, and you're meeting with Dr. Wilson in 15 minutes.

EVA	Thank you.

EVA	What is all this?

DOMINIQUE	Georgia A&M's food service contract, it's almost up. Just so happens that I own a couple of restaurants, and I want to make a bid on it. Grilled shrimp and stewed tomatoes, turkey meatloaf and mashed potatoes, salmon, and the healthiest mac and cheese you can find.

EVA	You don't need me to submit a bid.

DOMINIQUE	Right. Before you got here, this school wouldn't even take a donation from me, so kind of stands to reason that they're not gonna take my bid unless you make it happen. Just have a taste. Everything here is healthy and high-quality. That's made with almond milk, by the way.

EVA	Hmm. Mmm, God, that's good. I will make sure that your bid is considered. Till we meet again.

DOMINIQUE	Oh, before you run off, your B-school, you think you can help a couple of my employees with late admission?

EVA	And by employees do you mean waitresses or strippers?

DOMINIQUE	Dancers. Why does that make a difference?

EVA	So they're dancers?

DOMINIQUE	Book by its cover, Doctor. It's not gonna cost you anything. They'll pay their tuition up front.

EVA	I'll see what I can do.

DOMINIQUE	Okay, and I'll just remind you ever so gently that when you need a favor, I hook you up. 

CEDRIC	Hey. Thought you forgot about me.

BERETTA	Oh, baby, I thought about you every day.

CEDRIC	You left.

BERETTA	But I came back.

CEDRIC	But you left, ma.

BERETTA	I had to get back so I could work to get you out of here.

CEDRIC	So what, that's supposed to make it all right? Well, it ain't.

BERETTA	Cedric, you are about to have the best lawyer a bunch of overtime and a second mortgage on my house could buy. You want me to apologize for that?

CEDRIC	Let's just go.

BERETTA	Cedric. Cedric! You hear me calling you!

CEDRIC	What you snatching on me for?

BERETTA	Why are you being a asshole?

CEDRIC	Were you being a asshole when you left after five minutes even though I begged you not to? Hmm?

BERETTA	Disrespect me again, Cedric, and I'll slap the hell out of you.

CEDRIC	Can we go now? We leaving today or tomorrow?

BERETTA	We? You aren't going anywhere.

CEDRIC	I'm not staying here.

BERETTA	Dr. Fletcher has been very supportive. She made housing hold on to your dorm room. Your professors are gonna give you extra time to make up the work.

CEDRIC	Uh-uh, looklook what happened here. Ma, look what happened to Chantel.

BERETTA	I know.

CEDRIC	Ma, I have to go home, at least for Chantel's funeral. We can talk about whatever after that.

BERETTA	Baby, you missed it.

CEDRIC	I missed what?

BERETTA	The funeral was yesterday. Cedric, I'm sorry. Cedric.

CEDRIC	(sighs) There's nothing for me here.

BERETTA	(sighs) What if I stay here for, like, a week, until you get settled?

CEDRIC	I thought you couldn't take time off.

BERETTA	Cedric, please.

CEDRIC	I didn't even want to come here, and I really don't want to be here now. Ma, there's nothing but bad memories here.

BERETTA	Then make some good ones.

BERETTA	Son, you just got something kids who look like you don't get, a second chance. I know your heart is hurting, but if I let you go home, I wouldn't be doing my job as your mama. I'd be giving up hope. I'm not gonna do that, and I'm not letting you. You are staying in school.

NONI	You wanted to see me?

CECIL	Noni Williams, you were just promoted to first chair of your section. I'm told you're not in step.

NONI	I'll get it, sir.

CECIL	Show me what you got now.

NONI	Here?

CECIL	I'm not in the habit of people wasting my time.

NONI	Okay.

NONI	I'll get it, sir. It's a complicated move. I just got to try harder.

CECIL	You lack balance. Back up. Build the balance you need, and the move will come to you. Let's go.

NONI	That's impossible.

CECIL	Don't ever use that word in my presence. You make me wonder about you. Maybe you don't have what it takes to be great.

NONI	No, I know I do, sir.

CECIL	Well, if you knew you had it, "impossible" would never come out of your mouth. You'd be so busy trying to figure it out that you wouldn't have time for your mind to doubt.

CECIL	Good day.

NONI	I'd like to keep trying, sir.

CECIL	Then keep trying somewhere that isn't my office.

NONI	Will do.

CECIL	Noni? Take the box with you.

BRYCE	Hey. What's up, man? Ms. Hobbs, how you doing?

BERETTA	Beretta, remember?

BRYCE	Right, right, right. I was gonna come see you today. When'd you get out?

CEDRIC	Just now.

BRYCE	All right, well, welcome back, man. Hey, uh, about to meet my family. You all want to join us?

CEDRIC	Nah.

BRYCE	All right, uh, well, get settled in. I'll tell my dad the good news.

CEDRIC	Yeah, you do that, blue blood.

BERETTA	Hey, it was really great to see you, Bryce.

BRYCE	Good to see you too.

BERETTA	Yeah. 

LETREY	Hey! Hey! You're joking, right? In 15 minutes I'm getting the R.A.

TIESHA	Hey! Hey! Yo, what the hell is wrong with you? You need to take that shit outside.

NONI	It's late. It's dark. It's cold out there.

TIESHA	Okay, I already have to share my house with these nasty-ass boys because this broke-ass school went and shut down the boys dorm, and now you want me to give up my sleep because you in this bougie-ass band?

NONI	Put my box down. Put my box down!

EVA	Well, I'll be damned if we don't have the straightest white lines in college football. You know what? Give me a second, gentlemen. Excuse me, I, umI don't see Sydney Fletcher. Didn't she sign up to volunteer with this group?


CREW SUPERVISOR	I haven't seen her in a couple of hours. Okay, let's get started on section L.

CECIL	Game day is coming, first game of the season. Everybody know half the folks'll be heading to the exits after the halftime show, our halftime show. We are the ones that fill those stands. The football team, that's our opening act. We are not at the event. We are the event. In other words, it's marching band season. Begin.

DANNY	

MAN	All right, let's go.

CECIL	What the hell was that?

NONI	Sorry, sir. I'll get it next time.

CECIL	There'll be no next time. You're back at first chair. You're fourth. This is a marching band. Out there looking like one of them llamas or something. 

DANNY	Down. Let's go. This ain't no water break. Come on, up. One, up. Two, up. Three

JASON	Hey.

EVA	Jason, we need to talk.

JASON	Okay, come on in. Have a seat.

EVA	I'm just, uhI just need to make something clear, and then I'm leaving.

JASON	Well, I'm done with classes for the day. There's no rush. Would you like something to drink?

EVA	I take full responsibility for where we are. I was unhappy, and things happened.

JASON	And then they happened and happened.

EVA	It's over, Jason.

JASON	You keep doing this. Why you keep pushing me away when you know that you're into me?

EVA	What I'm into is making my family work.

JASON	Eva, you're fooling yourself. Your husband doesn't want you, okay? I do. Look, that's why I transferred here.

EVA	I didn't ask you to do that.

JASON	You didn'tyou didn't have to ask me to. All right, I know if I would have gave you any kind of a warning, you would have tried to do the right thing instead of doing what you really want to do.

EVA	I've been married 18 years. I'm not throwing that away, and you have to respect my decision.

JASON	What decision? You know what? You seem to change your mind about your decision every time you want me inside of you.

EVA	Okay, stay, don't stay, just not because of me.

JASON	Got it.

MAN	Eva Fletcher?

EVA	Yes?

MAN	You've been served.

MAN	Hey.

WOMAN	What?

BRYCE	I don't know. He was just acting weird, like he wasn't even happy to be out. He barely spoke to me and didn't even say thank you for dad's help.

CHARLES	[inaudible] good, son.

DUNCAN	Now, what makes you think dad helped him?

BRYCE	'Cause I asked him to. Plus, the last thing he'd do is tolerate a obvious injustice.

DUNCAN	Bryce, look at him. I mean, what's he dedicated to, justice or position?

BRYCE	Both.

DUNCAN	Look, I know the old man is your hero. He's mine too, but you got to know who he really is, the good, the bad, and the complicated.

BRYCE	I know who he really is.

DUNCAN	Okay. Of course you do.

CHARLES	Oh, that game will start, and you'll still be out here playing with this grill. Are those burgers gonna be ready anytime soon, son?

DUNCAN	They're ready right now, pop.

ALL	(yelling and cheering)

DEREK	You've reached Derek Fletcher. Please leave a message.

EVA	This is me again. Since you won't pick up, here's my message. You're nothing but a coward. You're a piece of shit coward who'll be living in a studio apartment by the time my lawyers are done with you! [SIGHS] Is there alcohol in that cup? You just don't get it, do you? You damn near drank yourself to death, and you're back at it already?

SYDNEY	Did I say alcohol was in that cup?

EVA	As soon as you're finished with this semester, you can take your ass back to your father because I have had about enough of both of you.

SYDNEY	Perfect, because we've both had enough of you.

EVA	Sydney, don't make me put my hands on you.

SYDNEY	In public? You'd never.

ALL	Oh!

CEDRIC	Damn, Chantel. [SIGHS] Well, what you doing here?

CHANTEL	What you think I'm doing here? I missed my man. Oh, I missed you. You miss me too?

CEDRIC	If there was any way that I could make this not truebut it is. It is.

CEDRIC	I miss you. I miss you so much.

ANNOUNCER	Ladies and gentlemen, we've got what no one expected, a football game. CSU leads Georgia A&M 17 to 14. Heisman candidate Lamar Oaks has a whopping five sacks and two forced fumbles. The Mountain Cats are on CSU's 40 yard line with 13 seconds left. Georgia A&M coach has called the Mountain Cats' last time-out, but oh, boy, there isn't much in the playbook with 13 seconds to 
score or else.

COACH HARDWICK	All right, what you like?

TERRENCE	Trips right with a flood post.

COACH HARDWICK	BoJohn?

BOJOHN	I say max protect, verticals. Slide protection to wherever Oaks lines up.

TERRENCE	Man, the receivers'll be double teamed. That's not gonna work, man.

BOJOHN	It will if I throw it.

TERRENCE	Yeah, just 'cause you [inaudible]…

COACH HARDWICK	All right, all right, all right.

TERRENCE	You think you fucking know everything, brother.

COACH HARDWICK	Pull it together, man.

EVA	Come on, BoJohn. Come on.

COACH HARDWICK	I got the play. BoJohn, get your helmet.

TERRENCE	Bullshit.

COACH HARDWICK	Let's go.

ANNOUNCER	How about that? BoJohn Folsom takes the field.

BEN	Yeah! It's about time. Now you're about to see some real football.

COACH HARDWICK	Let's go.

ANNOUNCER	But wait, so does quarterback Terrence Berry. What in the world is Coach Hardwick doing?	

BOJOHN	You're going [inaudible] cat on one, on one, ready?

ALL	(indistinct trash talking)

OAKS	Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

MAN	Watch out for the sneak. Go, go, go!

OAKS	Come on, come on, come on, come on! [Inaudible]!

ANNOUNCER	Wait, don't touch that dial. It's a fumble.

COACH HARDWICK	Damn it.

ANNOUNCER	Five, four, three, but wait!

DUNCAN	That’s it! That's it, baby!

SYDNEY	Whoo!

ANNOUNCER	If this isn't the greatest upset in Georgia state history, I don't know what is.

CHARLES	Yeah, yeah, GAMU.

ALL	GAMU! GAMU! GAMU! GAMU! GAMU!

ANNOUNCER	In miraculous fashion, the unranked Mountain Cats knock off fifth place CSU.

BOJOHN	We did it. I mean, nobody thought we could, but we did. We won.

BEN	You simple son of a bitch, you didn't even play till the end of the game, and what happened? Well, the whole damn country watched you lay the ball on the ground.

BOJOHN	Didn't you see my block? Daddy, come on. It's a W.

BEN	Are you back-talking me?

BOJOHN	I'm just saying this is a good

BEN	Don't you ever, everdon't you ever embarrass me like that again. Do you hear me, boy?

BOJOHN	Yeah.

EVA	It'll be a great opportunity. You can see exactly what your money is doing. They don't [inaudible].

DOMINIQUE	That's her.

WOMAN	Hors d'oeuvres?

DOMINIQUE	Dr. Fletcher?

EVA	Excuse me.

DOMINIQUE	Allow me to introduce you to the newest additions to your business school. This is Brooke and Nikki.

EVA	Hello.

BOTH	Hello.

EVA	Thank you for the striping machine. It is a thing of beauty.

DOMINIQUE	No, you are a thing of beauty. Like I said, I hook you up.

EVA	For which we are grateful. Nice meeting you, ladies. I look forward to seeing ou on campus.

BOTH	Thank you.

EVA	How are you?

MAN	Good evening.

EVA	Great to see you. Good to see you. Hey, how are you? Congratulations, Coach. That was some call at the end.

COACH HARDWICK	Well, it didn't quite work out as planned. It just shows you can never give up no matter how unlikely the win.

DOMINIQUE	There he is.

REPORTER	In other news, college sports had [inaudible]

BERETTA	GAMU was on it, baby! GAMU, we rep that. GAMU, we rep that. GAMU, we rep that. GAM, GAMU! Hey! Cedric, you watching, baby? Yeah? Yeah. Oh.
