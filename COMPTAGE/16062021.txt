ERIK:		Let's go.  (Grunting) 

ADRIAN:	Give me the girl. 

SARA:		No. 

JASON: 	No! Baby, you okay? 

SARA:		No! 

JASON:		Hey! No! She doesn't get on this plane. 

ERIK:		Shit. 

JASON:	You hurt her, I swear to God, I put a bullet in your head.  I'll take the shot, motherfucker. 

ADRIAN:	You get into my way, I'll create another one. 

ADRIAN:	Come any closer, I will kill her, end of story. 

SARA:		D-- daddy. 

ADRIAN:	Daddy? Tell your daddy to drop his weapon. 

SARA:		He says to give up, daddy. 

JASON:		Okay, sweetie. 

SARA:		Daddy. 

JASON:		Hey, baby. 

JENNIFER:	Hey, your appointment's in 30 minutes.  You're gonna make it, right? 

JASON:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on the way,  I just needed to-- I just needed to take a break, step out of the car for a minute. 

JENNIFER:	You needed a caffeine fix? 

JASON:	Well, you had me stop smokin', I did that, didn't I?  We could put uh, coffee at the top of the next list.  Usual, please, ma'am. 

JENNIFER:	Just don't be late, okay, soldier boy. Honey? Jason, you okay? 

JASON:		Thank you. 

JENNIFER:	Baby, you're scaring me. 

JASON:		I'm fine, baby. 

JENNIFER:	I love you. 

JASON:		I love you, too, babe. I'll see you in just a few. 

JASON:		Thank you, ma'am. 

REINO:		Yes, ma'am.  Hey, Malone, that's the third one this morning. 

MALONE:	Let me guess.  Barbara? 

REINO:		Yep. 

CHARLIE:	Look, did you tell her we can't do anything about traffic when top brass comes through? 

REINO:	I told her, but apparently she was late to work this morning because of a big city motorcade. 

MALONE:	Christ, it's just two cars. 

REINO:		Who is it this time? 

MALONE:	I don't know. Washington PD wouldn't even tell me.  Must be pretty high up. 

REINO:		Heading to the VA? 

MALONE:	Well, they ain't in Oakside for the ice-fishing. 

JASON:		Hey, baby. I'm sorry. 

JENNIFER:	You're 14 minutes late. 

JASON:	I know, I know and-- I actually thought today I was gonna be early  and I really tried. (Kissing) 

JENNIFER:	These are my colleagues. 

JASON:	I know, I know. Listen, Gutterman doesn't discuss anything I say to her with anybody, right? 

JENNIFER:	No, no, of course not. 

JASON:		Okay. 
JENNIFER:	But I would like to be a fly on the wall. 

JASON:		I know you would, I know you would. 

JENNIFER:	You still on for lunch? 

JASON:	Yeah, of course. I asked Sara's mom to drop Sara off here just 'cause these things never end on time, you know? 

JENNIFER:	Yeah, sounds good. You okay? 

JASON:	Yeah, you know, it's just the cold weather just makes it worse, you know? Listen, I think Sara may actually be off the team. 

JENNIFER:	What? 

JASON:		She went spikes up on a slide tackle.  I think she actually hurt a girl. 

JENNIFER:	Was this intentional? 

JASON:	It was hard for me to believe that she would do anything like that intentionally. I think she just doesn't know her own strength,  you know? 

JENNIFER:	We need to discuss this at lunch. 

JASON:		I know. I just wanted you to know in advance. 

JENNIFER:	Thank you. 

WANDA:	Excuse me, Mr. Hill? You have to check in, sir. 

JASON:		I'm with her. 

WANDA:	You're a lucky man. But you have to sign in. 

JASON:		Right. 

JENNIFER:	I'll see you later. Alright, I'll see you later. I will sign in. 

WANDA:	You do understand how regulations work, right?  You come to the security desk, you check in, I give you a day pass, and then you see a doctor. You see how that happens right there? 

JASON:		I do see how it happens, Ms. Wanda. 

WANDA:	Yeah. 

JASON:		But I'm Jason Hill, I'm here every day. 

WANDA:	Well, Jason Hill needs to sign in.  Come on. 

JASON:		Jason Hill will sign in. 

WANDA:	Mm, he will. 

JASON:	So Wanda, I think you missed your calling. I think you'd make a pretty good drill sergeant. 

WANDA:	I like to think I serve in my own way.  Here's your day pass. Don't forget to turn it in when you leave, okay? 

JASON:		I will not forget that, Ms. Wanda. 

WANDA:	Have a nice day, Mr. Hill. 

JASON:		You, too, ma'am. 

JENNIFER:	What is this? 

ERIK:		Out of order, ma'am. 

JENNIFER:	We can't have broken elevators at a hospital. We have injured soldiers, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs. 

ERIK:		I understand. We've put in an emergency repair order. 

JENNIFER:	Well, I hope they get here soon. 

ADRIAN:	Johnny, have you ever been to a bullfight before?  I have.  Thousands of people gather to watch an innocent animal die. It is terrible. 

JOHNNY:	Just kill me. 

ADRIAN:	What the audience doesn't see is that the bull has been wounded before it faces the fighter.  It has been beaten, bled, exhausted before it even enters the ring. Does that make the matador appear any less courageous in front of the bloodthirsty crowds?  No. 

JOHNNY:	I don't wanna listen to you anymore. 

ADRIAN:	The bull still has a chance. Occasionally, the bullfighter gets gored, but I'm always rooting for the bull. 

JOHNNY:	Fuck you. 
ADRIAN:	Erik.  Thank you. You're a tough man, I'll give you that.  Willing to die for God, country. I respect that. You are Johnathan Fergosi from Washington State.  Ah, the Northwest, beautiful. And your unit was specifically tasked with capturing of one David Rabikov last year.  Where is he being held? Are you willing to let little Thomas die?  I bet you call him "Tommy", no? 

JOHNNY:	You go to hell. 

ADRIAN:	I'm afraid you'll beat me there, Johnathan, but the question is who else must join you? Huh?  Your wife Rebecca? Younger sister Michele? Your niece Alison? I know where they live. I know everything about your little life, but...  ...I'm not one for unnecessary violence, huh. It sickens me. 

ERIK:		I was kinda hoping for more of a fight. 

ADRIAN:	You will tell us, because if you don't, they will all die. And not quickly, because people like Erik will do terrible things for money. Here, I'll demonstrate. Erik. 

ADRIAN:	Who ordered for my brother to be taken? Was it General Davis?  General Arthur? General Welch? Ah! General Welch. Good. Now, we know. General Welch ordered the capture of my brother. 

JOHNNY:	You know nothing. 

ADRIAN:	Where is he being held? Hmm? Where is my brother being held? 

ADRIAN:	Where is he being held? 

JOHNNY:	My name is Johnathan Fergosi. 

JOHNNY:	Serial number-- 

ADRIAN:	Yes, yes, we know. Where is he being held? 

JOHNNY:	My name is Johnathan Fergosi. Serial number V-113. 

ADRIAN:	Erik. 

JOHNNY:	Serial number-- My name is Johnathan Fergosi. My serial number is-- (Coughing) My name is Johnathan Fergosi! 

JASON:		Okay, so where do you want me to start? 

DR. GUTTERMAN:	That's your call. 

JASON:	Okay, but I don't wanna get into all the how it makes me feel and shit, okay? 'cause that's-- it's—

DR. GUTTERMAN:	I didn't ask you how it makes you feel and shit. 

JASON:		Okay, good, good. 

DR. GUTTERMAN:	You still haven't talked about the incident that brought you here. Lay it on the line. Just the facts. 

JASON:	Yeah, just the facts. Okay, um, you know, we were on a patrol. It was cold, Jesus. A lot colder than it gets here. And Jerry told a joke. Jerry was such an idiot. 

JERRY:		Hey, yo. 

JASON:		Hey. 

JERRY:	I heard Johnny's been sleeping with my wife since I've been deployed, man. I don't really care that much, so... But I will kill that son of a bitch  if he's been drinking my beer. 

JASON:	He made me laugh more than anybody I've ever met in my life, Jerry. And I was laughing so fuckin' hard at this joke that uh-- I just didn't hear what uh, Sosa was yellin'. 

SOSA:		Stop! 

JASON:	You know, I didn't see or feel anything. Just this fuckin' ringing, you know?  Just-- just-- just--  And I must have hit my head pretty hard you know, because I-- I-- I couldn't, uh-- I just-- I couldn't position. But Jerry was screamin' my name. But I couldn't see, there was just so much smoke. Until I could see. And his arm was just gone, you know? That IED was just-- just a trap, you know?  They were clearly waitin' for it. And Jerry was the only other one of us left  and he just kept screaming my name you know, and I just couldn't, uh--  I couldn't pull my leg loose or clear, you know? And then the screaming just stopped. You know? And he couldn't have been more than 3, 4 feet from me to-- you know? Phew. And that's uh, that's it, you know? Just uh, it's just a bad day, you know? Nothin' else. Just a fuckin'-- Just a bad day. 

DR. GUTTERMAN:	I'm sorry you had to go through that, Jason. 

JASON:		It's fine, it's not a big deal, you know? 

DR. GUTTERMAN:	Facing it is hard. 

JASON:		No. It's what they pay for, you know? So Valium? Xanax? 





JENNIFER:	Great session today, Brian. Same time next week? 

BRIAN:		Uh, actually I was thinkin' that I just stick around for a group later. 

JENNIFER:	There's always room. 

BRIAN:		Cool, then I'll see you later. Bye, Anne. 

ANNE:		Well, you're 45 minutes late for your lunch with your husband and daughter. 

JENNIFER:	You're amazing. What is this 3:00 appointment? 

ANNE:		Red level. They wouldn't give me a name. 

JENNIFER:	We haven't had top brass in here in months. When did this come in? 

ANNE:		About an hour ago. 

JENNIFER:	I'll make it work. Uh, do me a favor and call the elevator repair company again. 

JASON:		So Marcy's mom was okay with pickin' you up? 

SARA:		She says she likes helping people who need it. 

JASON:	Who need it. That's very clever of Marcy's mom. That's your mom. Lost and found. 

JENNIFER:	I am so sorry. 

JASON:	Go ahead, sell all my stuff. Me and the monster will move to Mexico,  Sell t-shirts to tourists, you know? Fish whenever we want. 

JENNIFER:	Oh my God, take me with you. 

SARA:		I'm not fishing ever, okay? 

JASON:		Wha-- what? 

SARA:		It's cruel. 

JASON:		Okay, we'll throw 'em back. 

JENNIFER:	Where are you guys? 
JASON:		Uh, we're right outside the private area. Where we're supposed to be. 

SARA:		I'm not fishing, okay? 

JASON:		Okay. 

JENNIFER:	Okay, you're eating without me? 

JASON:	Well, you were supposed to be here over two hours ago. The monster was hungry. I had to get her a snack, you know? 

JENNIFER:	Did you at least feed her something moderately healthy? 

JASON:		Yes, I got her somethin' incredibly healthy. 

JENNIFER:	So? 

JASON:		So... Okay, that sounds like we're not having lunch. 

JENNIFER:	Red appointment, I'm sorry. 

JASON:		That's okay, you know, duty calls. 

JENNIFER:	Let me talk to Sara. 

JASON:		It's your mama. 

SARA:		Mmhmm.  So you're not coming? 

JENNIFER:	I'm sorry, honey. I'll see you at home after practice, okay? 

SARA:		That's okay. But dad totally got me candy, so-- 

JASON:	Traitor. First of all, she's the one who picked out the candy. I was gonna have her drink like a kale broccoli smoothie. 

JENNIFER:	Two suits just walked into my office. Ear pieces. I'm guessing that's for me. It's gonna be a long night. Jason, did I lose you? 

JASON:		You're not gonna believe this. 

JENNIFER:	What? 

JASON:		General Welch, Joint Chief of Staff. 

JENNIFER:	You're kidding. 

JASON:		That must be your guy, huh? 

JENNIFER:	Okay, well, just get her to practice. If she's late again those other moms are gonna give me hell. 

JASON:		On it. Alright, babe, we'll see you about the house. 

JENNIFER:	I love you. 

JASON:	I love, you, too. Okay, well, looks like it's just gonna be us discussing you goin' spikes up on that girl. 

JENNIFER:	That was an accident. 

JASON:		Yeah, well, you hurt her. 

CHAD:	Ma'am. Havin' a heck of a time. You mind giving me a hand. I have your daughter. 

MRS. WELCH:	Excuse me? 

CHAD:	I have your daughter. Get in. No use in running, Mrs. Welch. Get in and maybe you two will survive this. Let's go. 

ANNE:		Uh, excuse me. 

JENNIFER:	Thank you. 

MAX:		Voorhees Elevator Service & Repair. How can I help you? 

ANNE:		Can I speak with Luis, please? 

MAX:		Yeah, Luis called in sick today. My name's Harry. 

ANNE:	I had an appointment scheduled for today and nobody showed. Well, is there a name on the account? Oakside VA. Luis didn't give me an order number or anything. 

MAX:	Oh, I see it here in the notes. Yeah, it looks like it never made it into the system. Yeah, I'll tell you what-- 

IVAN:		Not even Willie Nelson? 

ZERO:		No, fuck country music. 

IVAN:		Johnny Cash? 

MAX:		We'll send somebody out right away. 

ZERO:		Well, yeah, Johnny Cash. That's different. 

MAX:	Guys, shut up! Is there a door code or anything or should we just call again when our man arrives? 

ANNE:	Just have him go to the front security desk. They'll show him where to go from there. 

MAX:	Tight. Thanks so much. We'll see you soon. We got a green light on door one. Excellent. 

ADRIAN:	Commence phase two. 

WELCH:	I'm here for a 3:00. 

JENNIFER:	Please, come in. 

WELCH:	Thank you. 

WANDA:	Can I help you, gentlemen? 

MAX:		Hey, there, we're here to prepare the elevator. 

WANDA:	But your office said one guy. I can't be letting four people in here without clearance. You two, wait right there! I'll check this out. 

MAX:		Yeah, I don't think we're gonna be able to let you do that. Security. 

REINO:	Yeah, this is Officer Reino, Oakside Police. Uh, we received an alarm signal from this location. Is everything alright? 

MAX:		Alarm. Uh, I am so sorry. I'm new, I uh, must've just bumped it. 

REINO:		And what happened to Wanda Phillips? 

MAX:		Uh, she's takin' some time off. Uh, family emergency. 

REINO:		Hey, something's up. 

MALONE:	Hello, this is Police Chief Malone. Please, provide the seven-digit security alarm system code. Uh, absolutely. Just one moment. 

MAX:		Marty. 

ZERO:		It's Zero. 
MAX:		What? 

ZERO:		The name's Zero. Something wrong with your ears? 

MAX:		Just give me the goddamn code, Marty! Now, would be nice. 

ZERO:		There. 94850912. 

MAX:		I only have an eight-digit. Uh, 94850912. 

MALONE:	Okay, be careful with that system. Next time, we'll have to send someone out. 

MAX:		Thank you. 

MALONE:	It's fine. Relax. 

DR. GUTTERMAN:	I heard an alarm. Are you new here? 

MAX:		Uh, yeah, the usual lady went home sick. Um, the service sent me.  I'm Larry. 

DR. GUTTERMAN:	I'm Dr. Gutterman. 

MAX:		It's nice to meet you. 

DR. GUTTERMAN:	Have a nice night, Larry. 

MAX:		Thanks, you, too. Front security desk secure. Erik, you're up. 

REINO:		I don't know, I don't like it, sir. And that didn't seem off to you? 

MALONE:	Nothin' ever happens in sleepy Oakside, that's why people move here. That's why I got transferred here. You want action, move to the big city. 

DR. GUTTERMAN:	Please, everything, take it! (Grunting) 

ERIK:		Got the badge. Coat won't fit, though. 

ADRIAN:	Go to phase three. Carry the coat. 

ERIK:	Why do we have to call them "phases"? Why don't you just say, "Erik, come back into the building." 

ADRIAN:	Go into the building. 

ERIK:		Thank you, sir. 

MALONE:	Malone. 
RICHARDS:	Chief Malone, this is Special Agent Richards of the FBI. 

MALONE:	Okay. 

RICHARDS	We have reason to believe a wanted fugitive may be in your town. We could use your help in locating this man. 

MALONE:	Uh, could you be more specific? 

RICHARDS:	Check your email. 

MALONE:	"Adrian Rabikov. International terrorist." The hell would he want in Oakside? 

RICHARDS:	Your guess is as good as ours. If anything out of the ordinary happens, just give us a call. 

MALONE:	Okay. Reino! 

REINO:		Yeah, chief? 

MALONE:	Got another face for you to add to the website. I'm emailing it to you now. 

SARA:	Marcy says that she's the best goalie, but she just doesn't let anyone else try.  So I'm like how does she know that we're not better than her, you know? 

JASON:		Uh, she doesn't, she has no way to know that. 

SARA:		Right, that's what I'm saying! And like she's all over Chris every day at lunch-- 

JASON:		Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 

SARA:		I'm just like-- 

JASON:		Who is Chris? 

SARA:		He's my boyfriend. 

JASON:	Sara, you're 14 years old. Does-- does your mom know about this boyfriend crap? 

SARA:		Duh. Chris is taking me to homecoming. He's a nice guy-- 

JASON:		Yeah. 

SARA:	If you give him a chance. And the new girl Tiffany, she has a cousin and he's taking Marcy. 


JASON:		Sara, wait. 

SARA:		He has a new SUV, so he's gonna take us altogether. 

JASON:	No 15-year-old named "Chris" is takin' you anywhere in an SUV-- excuse me, sir. Where's uh, where's Beth today? 

MAX:		Oh, she went home sick. 

JASON:		Right. Tell her I hope she feels better. 

MAX:		Will do. 

JASON:	Come on, sweetie. Okay, we're gonna talk about that foul on the soccer field, alright? 

SARA		Uh, I don't think it was my fault, you know? 

JASON	Well, look, there's a place for that, but the soccer field is not one of 'em, alright? 

SARA:		Where's the place for that? 

JASON:		We'll talk about that later. 

JASON:		With your mom. 

SARA:		Thanks. 

JASON:	Dad's got to make a quick phone call here. Here, start the car, turn the heater on. 

SARA:		Okay. 

CHARLIE:	Oakside Police emergency line. How may I help you? 

JASON:	Yeah, I'd like to report some suspicious activity at the VA hospital. I just saw some men-- 

CHARLIE:	Suspicious men? 

JASON:		Someone could be in danger. 

CHARLIE:	Who? 

JASON:		Possibly a high-ranking military official. Look, I-- 
MALONE:	Uh, this is Chief Malone. Can you please start from the beginning? 

JASON:	Listen, chief, I just saw five repairmen walk past security without swipin' their badges. One of them was armed. 

MALONE:	Sir, do you work for the hospital? 

JASON:		Uh, no. 

MALONE:	Are you a patient? 

JASON:		Yeah, but my wife-- 

MALONE:	Well, sir, I wanna say thank you for your service and we'll be looking into this. 

JASON:		Okay. Okay, so you'll send a car? 

MALONE:	Uh, we will be checking out the report. 

JASON:	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look, look, look, look, Chief, I know what you're doin'. You're blowin' me off. 

MALONE:	Sir, please calm down. There's no need to get excited. 

JASON:		Send a car to check it out. This could go sideways very quickly. 

MALONE:	Like I said, we will have someone look into it. 

JASON:		Bullshit! 

CHARLIE:	Uh, sir, if you'd like to make a formal report, you can always come down to the station. 

JASON:		Then send a car, one with an officer in it. 

MALONE:	As I said before, we will have someone looking into this. Again, thank you for your service. 

REINO:		Man, Charlie, something's up, right? 

CHARLIE:	Yeah, he sounded pretty amped-up to me. 

REINO:		Hey, Malone, I'm tellin' you, something's goin' on at that hospital. 

MALONE:	The man is at a VA PTSD ward talkin' about a conspiracy. 

REINO:		Come on. Can-- can-- can you just send one of us please? 
MALONE:	Charlie, go. 

CHARLIE:	Oh, come on! The guy's a nut job! 

MALONE:	Satisfied? 

REINO:		Yes, thank you. 

CHARLIE:	This is great, guys. 

JENNIFER:	This is Dr. Jennifer Hill. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you  as soon as I'm available. 

JASON:		Shit. 

JENNIFER:	Have a nice day. 

JASON:	Hey, babe, it's me. Uh, give me a call as soon as you get this, would you please? Something's not right. I'm uh-- I'm still at the VA. I just saw some-- just-- just uh--  Just give me a call will you? I love you. Bye-bye. 

ZERO:		Max. 

MAX:		Yeah, go. 

ZERO:		We have a guy out here pacing. 

MAX		Is he gonna be an issue? 

ZERO:		It's hard to tell. I could take him out. 

MAX		Fine, kill him. 

ZERO 		He does have a kid with him. 

MAX:		I say don't kill him unless you have to. 

ZERO:		I'll kill him if you want me to. 

MAX:		You're the one who thinks he's an issue. Is there an issue? 

ZERO:		I just said he's pacing. 

MAX:		Keep the channel clear. 

BRIAN:		Sash, let's play a game. Which one would you pick, only if you had to? 

SASHA:	Oh, well, he's kinda cute. 

BRIAN:		Yeah, he is cute. 

SASHA:	Alright, listen. 

BRIAN:		Hey, man. 

SASHA:	You're on a desert island, which one of us are you takin' with you? 

BLONDIE:	Remember, blondes have more fun. 

BRIAN:		And more damage. 

SASHA:	Yeah, listen, we're all soldiers here,  alright, okay? 

BRIAN:		Who do you think's in there anyway? 

ANNE:		Dr. Hill's office, Anne speaking. How may I help you? 

JASON:		Anne, Anne, Anne, it's me. Would you put Jennifer on the phone please? 

ANNE:		I'll have to take a message, I can't disturb her right now. 

JASON:	No, hey, Anne, I understand that. I wouldn't call unless it was an emergency.  Just knock on the door and get her on the phone. 

ANNE:		Jason, I'm sorry, but I can't do that. 

JASON:		Goddammit, Anne, put Jennifer on the phone now! 

ANNE:		Asshole. 

SARA:		Dad, you were totally cussing out there. 

JASON:		I know. 

SARA:		It's not a good look and you're a shitty influence on me. 

JASON:		I apologize. Do as I say, not as I do. 

SARA:		Okay. 

JASON:		Look, I gotta do something for your mom real quick. 

SARA:	Yeah, but I have to get to practice, I can't be late and you have to feed your children, it's the law, I think. 

JASON:	I understand. I'm gonna feed my child. Call Marcy's mother, see if she can pick you up here. Can you do that? 

SARA:		But I have to get to practice. 

JASON:	I understand, we're gonna get you to practice. How much battery power you have left on your phone? 

SARA:		Uh, 70 percent. 

JASON:	Okay, call Marcy's mother, have her pick you up right here. You can watch a movie in the meantime, alright? 

SARA:		Yeah, but what if she can't come get me? 

JASON:		Then you wait for me here, okay? I will be back. Tell me you understand, Sara. 

SARA:		I understand. 

JASON:		Good. I love you. 

SARA:		I love you, too. 

JASON:		I'll be back. 

ZERO:		He's coming in to you, Max. Alone. The kid's still in the car. 

MAX:		Copy. 

JASON:		How you doin', man? 

MAX:		Good. 

JASON:		You don't need my pass? 

MAX:		Oh, the system's just having troubles. Go ahead, I already saw you in here. 

JASON:		Right. 

MAX:		Boss. 

ADRIAN:	Everything going smoothly I see. 

MAX:		Smooth as silk.  Well... 

ADRIAN:	Speak to me. 
MAX:		That guy who left, came back. Pacing guy. 

ADRIAN:	Problem? 

MAX:		Not sure. I think he suspects something's up. 

ADRIAN:	Ivan, Vee, sweep for a possible issue. He is suspicious. Kill him. 

VEE:		Copy. Let's go. 

ZERO:		I was just sayin' out loud you know, I could have killed him. I offered. 

ADRIAN:	Overwatch, are you there? 

JACKSON:	In position. Up and running in five. 

ADRIAN:	If you see a man fitting that description, leave, and let Max here know. 

JACKSON:	Understood. 

ADRIAN:	Handled. I trust you can manage that yourself in the future. 

MAX:		Yeah, boss. Thank you. I didn't know we had Jackson on this one. 

MAX:		Jackson? 

JACKSON:	Hey, Max. 

MAX:		Small fucking world, man. 

JACKSON:	Glad to hear your voice, kid. 

ADRIAN:	Phase four. Follow the plan accordingly and we'll all be having Margaritas in Cabo in 48 hours. 

ERIK:		I want a Mai Tai. 

ADRIAN:	Then you'll have one. Commence with phase four. 

IVAN:		Seems to be going smoothly, yeah? 

VEE:		Sure. 

IVAN:		First job you've done? 

VEE:		Why're you talkin' to me? 

IVAN:		Just trying' to be friendly. 

VEE:	Well, don't try so hard. Just finish the sweep and let's head back up. I wanna get this over with. 

IVAN:		This is my fourth one. It's fast money. Figured I'll retire and go live on a beach. 

VEE:		Well, I wish you luck. 

IVAN:		I don't know why we don't just kill everybody and take the General with us. 

VEE:		You don't have to understand. You just have to follow Rabikov's orders. 

ERIK 		Vee. 

VEE:		Go. 

ERIK		We need you upstairs. 

VEE:		I'm on my way. 

MAX 		Did you find the guy? 

VEE 		Finish the sweep. 

IVAN:		I'll continue looking on floor two, but there's nobody here. 

VEE		Make it fast. Andrei, Moriz, set up shop on the second floor. I'm on my way. 

ADRIAN:	Whoever does not wish to die, he will follow us immediately. Do not try to run, it is not advisable. Relax and follow these nice men here. 

ERIK:		Let's go, asshole. 

DARYL:		Get up, against the wall. 

ERIK:		Let's go, ladies. Let's go. 

DARYL:		Oh, hell no! Get back! 

ADRIAN:	That is an example. That. Relax, I am not an animal. Hmm. I was very clear. 		I'm actually sorry. Erik. 

VEE:		Uh, uh, uh, come on, back it up. Move. 



ERIK:		Against the wall. 

DARYL:		Sit down! 

ERIK:		You got this? 

VEE:		Ivan, hurry up. 

ADRIAN:	Vee, he's an idiot. 

VEE:		I know. He's growin' on me. 

ADRIAN:	Oh, fuck. 

VEE:		Moriz, Andrei, make sure Ivan doesn't get lost. 

ANDREI:	Copy that. Let's go. 

JASON:		Shit. Okay, okay. 

MALONE:	Anybody gonna get that? I guess I'm the only one that works here.  Chief Malone. 

JASON:	Hello, this is Jason Hill. I'm at the VA hospital. I just saw multiple men with weapons. 

MALONE:	Sir, would they happen to be security guards? 

JASON:	No, goddammit, they're not security guards. I know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. Something is goin'on here, people are gonna die! Send your men. 

MALONE:	Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down, okay? 

JASON:		Something is goin' down and people are gonna die, goddammit. 

MALONE:	Listen, sir. 

JASON:		Send them now! 

MALONE:	I've already sent someone down there. I'm gonna need you to be patient and remain calm. 

JASON:		Thank you. 

MALONE:	Is it a full moon? 

ANDREI:	Ivan. 
MORIZ:	Shit. 

ANDREI:	Boss. 

ADRIAN:	Go. 

ANDREI:	Ivan's down. Someone took his gun and ran downstairs. 

MORIZ:	Ivan's super messed-up. He ain't movin'. 

VEE:		What? 

ADRIAN:	Vee, your place is here. 

VEE:		Don't you want me to handle this guy? 

ADRIAN:	If you're going to do this with brutality, make sure it is focused. 

VEE:		Always, boss. 

ADRIAN:	Andrei, Vee is going to kill the person of interest. She has it handled, but if required please assist her in the execution. 

ANDREI:	Copy. 

ZERO:		Are you fucking serious? 

VEE:		Shut up, Zero, just shut up! 

ADRIAN:	I wish I was dealing with professionals. 

VEE:		Oh, Jesus, Andrei, I almost just shot you. What's the word? 

ANDREI:	Moriz is looking after Ivan. He should be okay. 

VEE:		Good. Standard bet? 

ANDREI:	50 goes to the one who gets the kill shot. Make it a 100. You're on. 

VEE:		Let's go. 

JENNIFER:	I get the feeling you're not a fan of this. 

WELCH:	Hmm. Another meeting with a doctor to see if I'm fit. You wanna hear about my childhood next? 

JENNIFER:	If you'd like to tell me more about your childhood, I'd love to listen. 
WELCH:	Every time something happens, a bureaucrat sends me to see another			headshrinker to make sure my fragile psyche is still intact. 

JENNIFER:	Is it? 

WELCH:	Don't be smart. 

JENNIFER:	That's why they use headshrinkers. 

WELCH:	Let's get this over with. 

JENNIFER:	Okay. 

MAX:		VA-33 security desk. How may I help you? 

REINO:		Yeah, this is Officer Reino of the Oakside Police department. 

REINO:		Uh, we've received reports of multiple armed men in the hospital. 

MAX:		Really? Uh, well, of our security forces haven't reported anything. 

REINO:		Nothing out of the ordinary? 

MAX:		No, but we'd be happy to look into it for you. 

REINO:	You know, it's probably just a disturbed patient. You should check the uh, basement. 	

MAX:		Copy. We'll uh, check out the basement and the PTSD ward. 

REINO:		Well, sorry to bother you. 

MAX:		Thank you. Boss, this guy is bein' a real pain. He called the cops. 

VEE:		Are you fucking kidding me? 

VEE:		Goddammit! 

ANDREI:	You wanna tell him? 

VEE:		You fuckin' do it. 

ERIK:		What about the money? 

ADRIAN:	You will be paid in proportion to what you do. 

ERIK:		Okay. 
ANDREI:	Boss. 

ADRIAN:	What is it? 

ANDREI:	He got out the back door, he's gone. Go back to your posts. 

ADRIAN:	Daryl, get the door charges in place. 

DARYL:		Copy that. 

ADRIAN:	Max, assist Daryl with the placement of the door charges.  All cell phones into the bag. It is simple. No one else needs to get hurt. As long as you don't try to escape, as long as you do not try to hinder our efforts, and do not complain, you will live. Is that all the phones? Check this one. 

ERIK:		Uh-oh. 

NURSE 1:	I-- please, please, I-- 

NURSE 2	No, no, no, no. 

MAN:		No, no, no! 

CROWD	No, no, please. 

NURSE 2 	No, no. 

ERIK:		Give me your cell phone. 

NURSE 2 	No, no. 

MAN		No! No, no. 

ADRIAN:	I feel like you do not understand what is happening here. You think that I want to kill this woman? I hate to make example of people! Especially a woman! I trust that is all the phones. Is that it? That is all the phones? 

ERIK:		Any more phones? 

WOMAN 1:	No, no. No. 

NURSE 2	No, no. 

WOMAN 1:	No, no, no. 

ADRIAN:	No, no, they made a mistake. Hmmf. Now, you may all sit here and pray that the United States government values your lives enoughto pay the ransom. Okay, well, you two come with me. Now, we're after the prize, okay? Let's move. 

DARYL:	Okay, you place the C-4. Run a line to the detonator. Then from the detonator to the switch. If the switch is broken by the door opening, the detonator blows the C-4. Easy. Pull this tab. Light is green, good to go. Ready to rock and roll. 

MAX:		You'd be okay with doing the rest? 

DARYL:		Relax, Max, I've done this many, many times.  I'm not scared of doin' all that. 

MAX:	Phew. I'm gonna go to the desk. Phew. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We're doin' that one, too? I'm stationed right here. Isn't that gonna take me out with whatever dipshit comes through that door? 

DARYL:		No, it's a contained blast. 

MAX:		I'd rather you didn't. 

DARYL:		Boss' orders. Every door! 

MAX:		Great. 

DARYL:		Good luck. 

MAX:	Hey, do you guys uh, still need me down here? Uh, you know, I just figured maybe you could use a hand or somethin'. Great. 

JENNIFER:	Why don't you tell me about happened? 

WELCH:	I ordered my men to perform an extraction. 

JENNIFER:	And it didn't go as planned? 

WELCH:	No. We got intel that an American responsible for a string of suicide bombings 
was holed up in a house in a small house just outside of Moscow. I ordered a covert mission to extract him. An order that I most certainly would issue again. 

JENNIFER:	Soldiers died as a result of your orders? 

WELCH:	Yes. One was taken. He was found three days later. All of his fingers had been cut off and he was beaten almost beyond recognition. I think about that. 

JENNIFER:	You blame yourself for the pain he suffered? 

WELCH:	We took his family into protective custody. I talked to them myself. I still think about all their tears. There hasn't been another bombing in that area since that night. So I think about that also. Those men were followin' my orders.  Sergeant Fergosi's death is on my hands. I'm proud of that brave man. He died doing what was right. We should all be so lucky. 

JENNIFER 	Admitting feelings is a sign that you're stillin a rational state of mind. 

BRIAN:		Who's in there anyway? 

BLONDIE:	I guess it's a big secret. Oh. 

VEE:		Nobody moves. 

BRIAN:		Just sit. 

ANDREI:	Sit down and shut up. 

BRIAN:		No, no, don't go. 

SASHA: 	No, no! 

BRIAN:		Don't go, man. 

SASHA:	No! 

ANDREI:	What'd I say? 

BRIAN:		Hey, hey! 

ANDREI:	Sit down! 

ANDREI:	What'd I say? 

BRIAN:		Who are you? 

ANDREI:	Hey! 

BRIAN:		No! 

ANDREI:	Sit down and shut up! 

BRIAN:		You point that gun at me! 

ADRIAN:	Andrei, I had to have access. 

WELCH:	I don't know who you are or what you want, but you're not gonna get it. 

ADRIAN:	We'll see. 

VEE:		Up. Move. 

ZERO:		How's everything goin' in there? 

MAX:		It's fine, Marty. 

ZERO:		It's Zero. Next time, I don't want van duty. 

ERIK:		Hey. 

DARYL:		Doors and windows are secure. Where's the boss? 

ERIK:	Off getting his prize. Come here. When do we get to the asking for the ransom part? 

DARYL:	After the perimeter's set, we call and make our demands. Did you read the stages? 

ERIK:	Why are there stages? Why don't we just make a plan and take it from there?  Why break it up? 

DARYL:		Because stages work. 

ERIK:		Get after her, you idiot! 

JASON:		No, no, no, no, no, no, it's rigged! 

DARYL 	Stop! You open that door and we both die. It's wired to blow! Look up. Look at it! 

JASON 		Don't do it, ma'am. Don't-- no, don't, don't. 

ZERO:		Was that us? 

JACKSON:	Yeah, that was us. Unless there's another group usin' our explosives  at the hospital. Front left. Max, you okay? 

MAX:		Yep. 

JACKSON:	Well, how about you go see what the hell that was all about? 

MAX:		Yeah. 

ERIK:	Calm down! Quiet! Calm down. Keep it down. I guess the world's gonna know we're here. 

REINO:		Oakside Police, how may I help you? Say that again. Chief! Chief, there's been		an assault in VA-33. 

ADRIAN:	In you go. What the hell was that? 

ERIK:		We lost one. Where's Daryl? Daryl? Daryl, come in. 

JACKSON:	I'm gonna guess Daryl ain't okay. I'll take 2:1 odds. Any takers? Okay, send men down there to see if he's dead. Secure the opening. 

ERIK:		Yes, sir. 

ADRIAN:	General. Have you ever been to a bull fight before? 

JASON:		Come on, sweetie, answer the phone. Answer the phone, baby. 

JASON:	Shit. I'm comin', Jen. Help. There was an explosion. Call the cops. And an ambulance, I'm injured. 

MAX:		I got you, buddy, just take it easy. 

JASON:		Yeah, take a seat, buddy. I got it from here. 

ZERO:		Max, are you there? 

JACKSON:	Max, don't fuck around. 

ZERO:		Max, what the fuck is goin' on? 

JASON:		Jen. Jen. Anne? Anne. 

ANNE:		No, please. 

JASON:		Anne. 

ANNE:		No. 

JASON:		Anne, it's me! What happened? 

ANNE:		They killed the guards. And they took them all. 

JASON:		Took 'em where? 

ANNE:		The meeting room. They said "the meeting room". 

JASON:		Come on, get up. Get up. 

ANNE:		They killed the guards. 

JASON:	It's okay, get in here. Stay in here, you don't open the door for any reason, you understand? 

CHARLIE:	Hey, guys, I'm over at the VA right now. Doesn't look like anything's goin' on here. I'm gonna look around and I'll let you know in a second. Oh shit! Multiple shots fired. Officer down. 

REINO:		Was it- was it, Charlie? 

CHARLIE:	I'm hurt, guys. 

MALONE:	Mobile unit still here? 

REINO:		Yes-- yes, sir. 

MALONE:	Get 'em on the horn, let's go. 

JASON:		Hey, hey. 

ZERO:		Here come the bobbies. I'm heading back to get into position. 

MALONE:	Set up a perimeter. Get these people back 100 yards. 

POLICEMAN:	Move back please, folks, for your own safety. Please move back. 

FORRESTER:	How's the hair? 

CAMERAMAN:	Beautiful. 

FORRESTER:	Dane Forester here, Action News, at VA-33. Not sure what's goin' on here right now, but as you can see we've had gunfire, we've had explosions. 

MALONE:	I need to get a line onto one of these assholes at the VA. 

REINO:		Can we cut the power to this grid? 

MALONE:	It's a hospital, a VA hospital. 

REINO:	Right. So they have their own generators, food for months, water storage. Oh my God. 

MALONE:	This is why they chose this place. We're not dealin' with amateurs. Now, we need snipers on every rooftop, and eyes on every entrance and exit. 

REINO:		Yeah, copy that. 

COMMAND:	Chief, line three. 

MALONE:	This is Chief Malone. Who am I speakin' with? 

ERIK:	We have Joint Chief of Staff General Frank Welch. All doors and windows are wired with C-4. Anyone attempting to approach the building will be shot. 

MALONE:	Okay, you have control. What do you want? How do we end this without anyone else gettin' hurt? 

ERIK:	50 million. Please deposit it in account J9494G34112402. It's the Swiss Bank Almotiz. I assume you're recording this? 

MALONE:	We are. 

ERIK:		Great, then I don't need to repeat myself. 

MALONE:	Is anyone hurt? 

ERIK:		No. 

MALONE:	May I speak with the General, please? 

ERIK:		Okay. General, say "hello". 

WELCH:	This is General Welch. 

REINO:		Holy shit. 

ERIK:	The money needs to be in our account within one hour, otherwise we will kill a hostage every fifteen minutes 

MALONE:	Look that kind of ransom is gonna take a while. An hour's not gonna be enough. How many hostages do you have? 

ERIK:	Oh, we have many. We also require a bus to take ourselves and the General tothe airport. Once we're onboard a fully-fueled 747, which you will provide for us, we'll let the General go before we take off. There will be no negotiations. Any attempt to change any of these plans and we will kill a hostage. Any attempt to enter this building and we will kill a hostage.  You have one hour. 

MALONE:	Okay, I do somethin' for you, you do somethin' for me. since you have so many hostages, how about lettin' one of the hostages go as a sign of good faith? 

ERIK:		You haven't done anything yet. You have one hour. 

MALONE:	Listen, Adrian. I-- I-- I assume I'm speakin' with Adrian Rabikov, right?  That went well. 

RICHARDS:	Which one of you is Malone? 

MALONE:	That would be me. 

RICHARDS:	Can I get a word? 

MALONE:	One moment. Look, find us a bus. If we can separate them from the other hostages and knock this down to just the General, that's our first win. 

RICHARDS:	Malone, we do not negotiate with terrorists. 

MALONE:	The FBI can relieve me of my command in a second, alright? But until then,  can one of you guys get on the horn, and call and see how much money we can transfer into that account immediately. I'd like to keep people from dying. 

RICHARDS:	It's the policy of the United States. We do not and will not negotiate with hostage-takers. Can you step outside a second please? 

MALONE:	This is not about money, this is about somethin' else, okay?  You think they're just gonna let the General go? Just let him waltz out of here? Come on, we need eyes in there. 

RICHARDS:	You are relieved of your command. 

MALONE:	There are innocent people in there, man. 

RICHARDS:	And if we give 'em what they want, there'll be a hundred of these situations		within the week. Either you step outside or you will be removed. 

ERIK:		I think that went really well. 

JENNIFER:	There's no reason to kill any of us. They'll give you what you want. 

ERIK:		I asked for $50 million, a bus, and a 747 within one hour. 

JENNIFER:	If you knew it was gonna take longer than that,  why didn't you just ask for more time? 

ERIK:		Sit down. 

JENNIFER:	Or what? You'll kill me?  You just told me you were gonna kill me anyway.  What's the difference?  An hour, now? 

ERIK:		Sit down. Sit down! 

MALONE:	Hey Reino, I need the number to the guy who called earlier from the VA. 

VEE:	Shit. Moriz. Moriz! Fuck! Guys, Moriz is dead. I'm coming back up with Ivan. Alright, come on. I got you, buddy, I got you. Come on. Can you walk? You got this. Let's go. 

ZERO:		Do you need me inside? 

ADRIAN:	Stay in position, Zero. Jackson, how about you go handle this issue? 

ZERO:		I could be useful. 

ADRIAN:	Stay boy. Zero, stay. Jackson, you copy? 

JACKSON:	My pleasure. 

ADRIAN:	Don't make it quick. 

JACKSON:	Wasn't going to. 

ADRIAN:	This is why I like you. 

JACKSON:	My fee doubles. 

ADRIAN:	Do it perfectly, I triple your fee. 

JASON:		Yes. 

MALONE:	Hello, Jason, this is Chief Malone. 

JASON:		Thanks a lot for the help. 

MALONE:	My bad. Look-- look, what's goin' on inside? You safe? 

JASON:		Safe? No, we're not safe, asshole. 

MALONE:	Talk to me. 

JASON:	Counted seven armed insurgents inside the building. Blast took out one, I took out another three, that means at the very least there's another three  armed insurgents still inside the building and they've got hostages. I'd say roughly 12. A dozen hostages, floor three, in the meeting room, East side of the building. And my wife is one of the hostages, and I'm sure you know this already, but they got General Welch. 

MALONE:	Okay, are you injured? 

JASON:	I'm fine. A cracked rib, maybe two. I'm gonna be fine. Look, all the in and outs are wired with C-4. These guys are not fuckin' around, buddy. The name "Rabikov" mean anything to you? 

MALONE:	It does. They know you're there? 

JASON:		I don't know. They gotta know somebody's knockin' off their men. 

MALONE:	Do they know they have your wife? 

JASON:		No, and goddammit, they better not find out either. 

MALONE:	Your phone got a camera? 

JASON:		Yeah. 

MALONE:	Got a plan. Now, hear me out. 

JACKSON:	I've got him. 

JASON:	Oh shit. Look, look, look, look, I-- I-- I'm--  my name is Dr. Williams. I was just havin' a nap in my office. And what the hell is goin' on here? 

JACKSON:	Oh yeah, well, I could just let you keep talking or we can do this. 

JASON:		Oh, yeah, that was actually pretty cool. I mean that's-- 

JACKSON:	You know what? There's more. 

JASON:		Oh, that drywall's got to be pissed then. 

JACKSON:	Now, I'm gonna kill you. 

VEE:		Whoa, whoa, whoa, freeze! Wait, don't turn around! I said, "Freeze"! 

JASON:		Okay. 

VEE:		Who are you? 

JASON:	My name is Dr. Williams. I fell asleep in my office, there was an explosion.  Where the fuck is everybody? 

VEE:		Okay, walk forward. Slowly. Keep your hands where I can see them. 

JASON:		Okay, calm down. 

VEE:	Don't tell me to fucking calm down! Keep walking. Get inside. I got a straggler here. Dr. Sleepy was hiding out on us. 

ERIK:		Up against the wall, come on. Turn around. Have a seat. Sit down. Sit down. 

ADRIAN:	Lock off the stairwells. We do not need any more trouble from whoever's playing hero. 

VEE:		I'm gonna go kill him. 

ADRIAN:	Lock off the stairwells and return here when you're finished. 

VEE:		Copy that. 

JASON:		What the hell is goin' on here? 

ADRIAN:	Shut him up. 

ERIK:		Be quiet. 

JASON:		Yeah. 

REINO:		So as long as we don't enter from here or here, we should be somewhere-- 

FBI GUY:	Hey, sir, you can't get in there now. 

MALONE:	Back off, back off, back off. 

FBI GUY:	You can't go in there. 

MALONE:	Look, I have a live feed in the room. 

RICHARDS:	How? 

MALONE:	A tipster had called in earlier from the VA. I thought he was-- look, just-- just watch. 

WELCH:	You can beat me all you want. 

ERIK:		Good. 
ADRIAN:	Do you know who I am? 

WELCH:	No. But whatever you want-- You won't get a damn thing out of me. 

ADRIAN:	This man in this chair is not a hero, he's a coward. My baby brother was taken in his sleep under this man's orders. Completely incapable of defending himself, he was a freedom fighter.  And there's no trial. Not even a record of it. 

WELCH:	Rabikov? 

ADRIAN:	You admit it. 

WELCH:	This isn't about some ransom. You don't want money. 

ERIK:	Oh, we want money. I'm here for the money.  All of us are here for the money, except him. 

ADRIAN:	Thank you, Erik. May I get back to it? My brother was-- 

WELCH:	This man is a terrorist. Him and his brother, an explosive expert, orchestrated six terrorist explosions,  killin' 113 people in three days. 

ADRIAN:	Terrorists?  The United States military, government is responsible for the deaths of millions of innocents. Are you not a terrorist, General? 

WELCH:	I'm a patriot. 

ADRIAN:	And I'm revenge. Where is my brother being held? It can be so easy. No still? Okay, well, we have something that you might care about more. 


MRS. WELCH:	Hey. 

CHAD:		Hmm. 

MRS. WELCH:	Hello. Hey. What do you want? Why are we here? 

CHAD:		Hello. I'm in position. Okay. She's here. Got the kid, too. 

WELCH:	You let them go. 

ADRIAN:	David Mikael Rabikov. His location for the lives of your family. A fair trade if you ask me. 

REINO:		Oh my God. They have the General's family. 

RICHARDS:	Look for anything we can use to pinpoint their location. 

ADRIAN:	You are at fault. Your wife and daughter dying. This is you. 

WELCH:	I'm gonna fuckin' kill you! You hear me! I'm gonna fuckin' kill both of you! 

ADRIAN:	You have a chance to save your soul. Hey, ungag her. 

WELCH:	Mickey. It's-- it's okay. Close your eyes. No matter what happens, we're together, okay? 

ADRIAN:	Okay. 

WELCH:	You hear me, honey? 

ADRIAN:	Yes, good. 

WELCH:	We're together, okay? 

ADRIAN:	This is your heroic father here. You affected my family, I will affect your family. Hurt the girl, hurt her. 

ERIK:		Hurt the little girl. 

MRS. WELCH:	Goddammit! 

CHAD:		Cute girl. Bit of a screamer. 

RICHARDS:	I know where they are. 

MALONE:	Where? 

WELCH:	I'm gonna kill you. 

ADRIAN:	Do you need more shame and guilt? Do you want more shame and guilt for your recovery? 

WELCH:	You're already dead, you hear me? You're dead. You and your little friends are all dead. 

MRS. WELCH:	I love you, too. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. 

ADRIAN:	Where is David Mikael Rabikov? 

WELCH:	What guarantee do I have if I tell you? 

ADRIAN:	My word. Only my word. 
WELCH:	Your word? Your word isn't worth anything. 

ADRIAN:	Well, General Welch, I give you my word that if you do not tell me the whereabouts of my brother in the next three seconds, I'm going to brutalize your family.  3, 2-- 

WELCH:	Your brother is dead. He's in a freezer in a facility somewhere outside of Moscow. I can't tell you which one. 

ADRIAN:	I do not believe you. 

WELCH:	He's dead! Your intel was wrong! He's on a cold slab, dead. 

ADRIAN:	My brother is not dead! I was Russian military and I will push your mind to the limits  if he is dead! 

WELCH:	He was never being held! And Sergeant Fergosi pulled the trigger. 

ADRIAN 	Welch, you better hope that my brother is not dead. You better be lying.  If he is dead, so is your family. 

SWAT TEAM:	Sir, area secure. 

ADRIAN:	No, no, no, what the fuck is that? 

WELCH:	Oh. 

ERIK:		Holy shit. 

JASON:		On my call. 

ADRIAN:	(Speaks Russian) 

VEE:		Sir, I think it's time to go. 

JASON:		Now! 

BRIAN:		Everybody, down! Everybody get behind me! 

JASON:		Ow. 

BRIAN:		Everybody, okay? 

JASON:		Jen! 

JENNIFER:	Jason! 

BRIAN:		Keep your heads down! 

JASON:		Oh. You okay? 

JENNIFER:	I'm okay. Where's Sara? 

JASON:		She's in the truck. 

JENNIFER:	The truck? 

JASON:	She's probably secure by now. They headed to the basement. We got wounded on floor two. All in and outs wired with explosive. Yeah. Don't leave this room till I come back. 

JENNIFER:	Okay. 

JASON:		You understand? 

JENNIFER:	Okay, be safe. 

ADRIAN:	Come on. 

SARA:		Dad! Dad! Are you-- are you there? This sucks! 

ADRIAN:	Grab the girl! 

VEE:		Go now, catch her, catch her, catch her. 

ADRIAN:	Take the girl. 

VEE:		Come on, we gotta go, we gotta go! 

SARA:		Dad, these guys got me! 

MALONE:	Freeze! Drop the weapon. 

JASON:		The-- the van. They're in the van! 

REINO:		Spread your legs, arms behind your back. Now! 

JASON:	My daughter is in the van! I spoke to the cop, talked to Chief Malone,  Goddammit! My name is Jason Hill! 

MALONE:	I'm Malone. Go get the car. Come on! 

JASON:		My truck. Here! 

VEE:		Good, got ourselves a little insurance policy. 

SARA:		You have no idea how much trouble you're in. 

VEE:		Ooh. 

ZERO:		Is this everybody? Jesus! 

IVAN:		We have to call and tell 'em we have a hostage. Get the money! 

ZERO:		We didn't get the money? 

VEE:		Just shut up and drive. 

REINO:	Uh, should have waited for backup. And why the hell aren't we in a patrol car right now? 

MALONE:	We're in pursuit of four heavily-armed perps  in a white van heading eastward on highway 163,  just south of the airport. 

JASON:	What are you talkin' about? The airport's 50 miles behind us. Oh no, there's a private airport right up here. 

MALONE: 	You're empty. 

JASON:	They had my daughter in the van. I was willin' to pull off. I got uh, some in the glove box. You mind if I protect myself? I appreciate it. 

REINO:		Nothin' ever happens in sleepy Oakside, huh? 

ERIK:		We got company quarter mile back. 

VEE:		Shit. 

ADRIAN:	How fast can we get that thing into the air? 

VEE:		Not fast enough. 

ERIK:		We're dead already, we just don't know it yet. 

MALONE:	Make a left up here. 

JASON		But the van. 

MALONE:	I know a shortcut. We'll get 'em. 

JASON:		Okay. 
IVAN:		Let's go. 

REINO:		Chief! 

SARA:		Help! No. 

JASON:		No! She doesn't get on this plane. 

ERIK:		Shit! 

JASON:	You hurt her, I swear to God, I'll put a bullet in your head. I'll take the shot, motherfucker. 

ADRIAN:	You get into my way, I'll create another one. 

JASON:		Baby, you okay? 

SARA:		No. 

JASON:		Hey! No! Hey! 

ADRIAN:	Come any closer, I will kill her, end of story. 

SARA:		Daddy. 

ADRIAN:	Daddy?  Tell your daddy to drop his weapon. 

SARA:		He says to give up, daddy. 

JASON:	Okay, sweetie. I'll put the gun down. But you let her go, alright?  I'll give you access to the plane, you go anywhere you want, take me if you want,  but you just leave her. We have a deal? We have a deal?  Sweetie, you alright? 

SARA:		Yeah. Yeah. 

JASON:		Okay, listen to me, honey. Listen to my voice. 

ADRIAN:	You listen to me. You stick to agreement? 

JASON:	I would never lie to you. Spike's up, buddy. I thought I told you to stay in the car. 

SARA:		I'm so sorry, dad. I won't do it again. 

JASON:		There's not gonna be any again. I think we owe your mom a call. 

JENNIFER:	Jason, please tell me you're okay. 

JASON:		We're gonna be home for supper. 

JENNIFER:	I'll see you at home. 

MALONE:	You okay? 

REINO:		I got shot. 

MALONE:	You wanted action, didn't you? 

REINO:		Hell yeah. 

MALONE:	Like I said, nothin' ever happens in sleepy Oakside. 

REINO:		That was badass. 

MALONE:	Hmm. 

REINO:		It hurts, though. You've been shot like h-- how many times? 

MALONE:	Yeah, yeah, you-- you were shot. 

REINO:		Yeah, but like-- 

MALONE:	Come on, keep up, keep up. Okay, come on.
