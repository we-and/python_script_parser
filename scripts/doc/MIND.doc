GERTIE	Wanna talk about it?

JENNIFER	Thanks, Gertie.

RICK	Hey, girl.

RICK	Jen, Jennifer.

RICK	Hey, how about after the test, we go steal a Hummer

RICK	and hang out?

RICK	I ain't bad company, just saying.

JENNIFER	Sounds amazing.

GERTIE	Is that what you call a pick up line these days?

RICK	Yeah.

JENNIFER	Oh, for sure. He's a panty dropper, that one.

RUBEN	Yeah, Rick, she has to actually like you, bro.

RICK	Up yours, fatass.

RUBEN	Oh, babe.

RICK	Yeah, muah.

RUBEN	Jennifer, you sure you don't wanna hit that?

CLIVE	Oh, watch out, someone's sassy this morning.

RICK	Yeah, yeah, keep laughing. See how hot it gets up in here.

RICK	I'm talking that nasty desert heat.

CLIVE	Oh, no, don't wanna make the fire guy angry.

RICK	Yeah, I know where you sleep, Clive.

COL. CLAYTON	Good morning, everyone.

COL. CLAYTON	Just remember your training

COL. CLAYTON	and all will go as planned.

COL. CLAYTON	This is not an exercise.

COL. CLAYTON	Today, we go live.

COL. CLAYTON	Satellite arrays on the western side

COL. CLAYTON	will beam your intentions to the target area

COL. CLAYTON	and we're gonna see what we're gonna see.

COL. CLAYTON	Copy?

GEN. WHITE	Colonel.

COL. CLAYTON	General, we weren't expecting you

COL. CLAYTON	until the 20th.

GEN. WHITE	That's why they call them surprise visits, colonel.

GEN. WHITE	Thought I'd come see for myself,

GEN. WHITE	see if it's worth all that BS you've been shoveling up the hill.

GEN. WHITE	First, I think it's a waste of DARPA taxpayer dollars,

GEN. WHITE	and probably the worst op name I've ever heard,

GEN. WHITE	Project MindBlown? But I'm here ready to be impressed,

GEN. WHITE	nice to meet you all.

COL. CLAYTON	We won't disappoint you, General.

COL. CLAYTON	All right, people, let's make history.

COL. CLAYTON	TK's, tap in.

WOMAN#3	Drone is clear of the test areas, sir.

COL. CLAYTON	Biometrics.

MAN#2	Online and ready, sir.

COL. CLAYTON	Satellite relay.

WOMAN#4	Targeting now.

COL. CLAYTON	Harmonic convergence?

MAN#3	Frequencies are hot, sir.

COL. CLAYTON	Target security?

MAN#4 	Target area is clear and secured.

MAN#5	TK's are tapped and ready for your projection.

COL. CLAYTON	Terrestrial?

CLIVE	Go.

COL. CLAYTON	Atmospheric?

RUBEN	We got a go.

COL. CLAYTON	Incendiary?	

RICK	Go.

COL. CLAYTON	Aqueous?

GERTIE	Go.

COL. CLAYTON	Sight?	
	
JENNIFER	Go.

COL. CLAYTON	Initiate.

COL. CLAYTON	General, we built a small mock town

COL. CLAYTON	about 50 miles outside of Edwards.

GEN. WHITE	Sounds like the nuke tests we did

GEN. WHITE	back in the '50s.

COL. CLAYTON	Except for we won't leave a radioactive wasteland

COL. CLAYTON	for the next 200 years.

GEN. WHITE	Well, that's always a good thing.

GEN. WHITE	But Colonel, I'm not convinced

GEN. WHITE	these people can do anything with their minds,

GEN. WHITE	yet let alone level a small town 50 miles away.

COL. CLAYTON	You will be.

GEN. WHITE	That's why I'm here. Let see what you got.

COL. CLAYTON	Let's begin the sequence,

COL. CLAYTON	Sight and Atmospheric's first.

COL. CLAYTON	Jennifer.

MAN#6	 V.O.	There's an old tale wrought

MAN#6	 V.O.	with the mystery of Tom the poet

MAN#6	 V.O.	and his muse

MAN#6	 V.O.	and the magic lake which gave a life to the words

MAN#6	 V.O.	the poet used.

MRS. SOREN	Probably cracked the radiator

MRS. SOREN	coming over that ridge on I58.

ADAM	Yeah, they got to fix that.

MRS. SOREN	They got to fix a lot, son.

ADAM	Yup, it's the radiator.

ADAM	Want me to check up on you in a couple of days a week?

MRS. SOREN	Son, I fixed Hellcats in Korea,

MRS. SOREN	tank busters,

MRS. SOREN	I don't need no babysitter.

ADAM	No offense,

ADAM	I'm just trying to be helpful.

ADAM	That crack's gonna take some welding by the way,

ADAM	I got to come back later.

MRS. SOREN	I can take care of this, son.

MRS. SOREN	Don't worry about it.

ADAM	Hey, hey, be careful, damn.

ADAM	Last thing we need is you

ADAM	Mrs. Soren, watch out.

ADAM	You okay? Let me call 911.

MRS. SOREN	Ten fingers, ten toes,

MRS. SOREN	I'll be all right.

MRS. SOREN	Lord Almighty,

MRS. SOREN	how the hell did that happen?

CASSIE	She is a tough old rug.

JAMIE	CASSIE	You guys see that?

CASSIE	JAMIE	Well, that's a weird dust devil.

JAMIE	CASSIE	Oh, shit. My windows are down.

COL. CLAYTON	Deploy.

GEN. WHITE	Whoa, whoa. What happened? Where's the feed to the test area?

GEN. WHITE	Where is it?

COL. CLAYTON	What we found, general, is the satellite transmissions

COL. CLAYTON	disrupt all the other wavelengths.

COL. CLAYTON	Jennifer,

COL. CLAYTON	guide us in.

ADAM REACTING	What the hell?

CASSIE	Jamie.

JAMIE	Cassie!

CASSIE	Jamie!

ADAM	Get down!

CASSIE	No!

CASSIE	No, Jamie!

GEN. WHITE	Is this normal?

COL. CLAYTON	We can clarify it.

RICK	Are you guys seeing this?

RUBEN REACTING	Whoa, whoa.

RUBEN REACTING	No, no, no, no.

RICK	What the hell is going on?

GERTIE	Something's wrong.

GERTIE	There's people.

COL. CLAYTON	That's the other town.

GERTIE	Shut it down.

RUBEN	Shut it down, man!

COL. CLAYTON	Okay. Stop it.

COL. CLAYTON	What's going on, colonel?
	
COL. CLAYTON	I said, shut it down!

MAN#13	Drone images coming in, sir.

GEN. WHITE	Colonel, this looks like a damn nightmare

GEN. WHITE	waiting to happen.

COL. CLAYTON	General, I don't understand.

GEN. WHITE	Well, you get paid to do so, Colonel.

JENNIFER	Oh, God, no.

RICK	What?

JENNIFER	Switch to TV. Turn on the news channel.

JENNIFER	This was us.

JENNIFER	We did this.

COL. CLAYTON	That's impossible.

JENNIFER	I guided in right.

JENNIFER	I saw the town, there was no one.

JENNIFER	I sensed no one.

COL. CLAYTON	All right. Shut them off.

JENNIFER	We killed those people.

GEN. WHITE	Excuse me?
	
COL. CLAYTON	Jennifer.	

GEN. WHITE	Colonel, I think it's time we were honest

GEN. WHITE	with each other, don't you?

GEN. WHITE	You were saying, young lady?

JENNIFER	I guided in right.

COL. CLAYTON	Jennifer.

JENNIFER	Yes?

COL. CLAYTON	May I have a word with you?

JENNIFER	Sure.

COL. CLAYTON	How are you holding up?

JENNIFER	I'm handling.

COL. CLAYTON	Are you sure?

JENNIFER	Yeah.

COL. CLAYTON	Are you really, really sure?

JENNIFER	What are you trying to say, colonel?

COL. CLAYTON	Well, you're the seer, why don't you tell me

COL. CLAYTON	what's on my mind?

COL. CLAYTON	You signed up for this.

COL. CLAYTON	You volunteered for this

COL. CLAYTON	and I need you, you're the leader of this group.

COL. CLAYTON	These other people, they look up to you.

COL. CLAYTON	You're the seer.

COL. CLAYTON	And unfortunately,

COL. CLAYTON	there's some bad things that have to happen

COL. CLAYTON	along the way, but think of the good.

COL. CLAYTON	Think of the good that you can do for this world.

JENNIFER	I did not sign up to destroy cities.

COL. CLAYTON	But did you sign up to save people,

COL. CLAYTON	to save little children from tsunamis

COL. CLAYTON	and famine

COL. CLAYTON	and earthquake?

COL. CLAYTON	That's the good that you have

COL. CLAYTON	within your ability.

COL. CLAYTON	but you got to stay strong.

COL. CLAYTON	You can't crack under this pressure.

JENNIFER	hey, you're in charge, Colonel.

JENNIFER	I did sign up for this, right?

COL. CLAYTON	Yes, ma'am, you did and I need you.

COL. CLAYTON	That'll be all.

COL. CLAYTON	And thank you.

FATHER V.O	Jenny, what did you do?

FATHER V.O.	Answer me.

JENNIFER	Stop that.

JENNIFER	Stop.

JENNIFER	Stop.

COL. CLAYTON	They're reporting nearly 700 dead.

COL. CLAYTON	There's no sign of anything happening at the target site.

COL. CLAYTON	We're going through every record, but so far,

COL. CLAYTON	we haven't found the problem.

COL. CLAYTON	Don't blame yourselves.

COL. CLAYTON	This is not your fault.

COL. CLAYTON	Satellite targeting must have been off.

COL. CLAYTON	We all saw your visualization.

COL. CLAYTON	Jennifer guided us in

COL. CLAYTON	right to the mock town.

COL. CLAYTON	Look, we know it works.

COL. CLAYTON	Gen. White will keep the project going.

COL. CLAYTON	We just need to work out the bugs.

JENNIFER	The bugs?

JENNIFER	There were people.

COL. CLAYTON	You all don't wanna know how many lives

COL. CLAYTON	were sacrificed during the Manhattan Project,

COL. CLAYTON	how many phases,

COL. CLAYTON	how many failures.

COL. CLAYTON	We're doing something that's never been done before

COL. CLAYTON	in the history of mankind,

COL. CLAYTON	and this is the hard reality

COL. CLAYTON	to bring good to the masses.

COL. CLAYTON	The price is heavy.

COL. CLAYTON	Get some rest.

COL. CLAYTON	You got a big day ahead of you tomorrow,

COL. CLAYTON	and there's no base leaves

COL. CLAYTON	until we get this figured out.

COL. CLAYTON	Is that understood?

COL. CLAYTON	Great.

COL. CLAYTON	Good night.

RUBEN	Well, this sucks.

RUBEN	How'd they mess this up?

RICK	Hey, are you okay?

JENNIFER	It was him.

RUBEN	He's not a TK.		

JENNIFER	Get off.	

RICK	What?	

CLIVE	He probably just wanted a show for the Pentagon.

GERTIE	Oh, there was definitely a presence there.

RUBEN	Yeah.
	
JENNIFER	That survivor, the one I saw

RUBEN	JENNIFER	right before we pulled the plug,


RUBEN	JENNIFER	he means something,

RUBEN	JENNIFER	and I think we need to keep an eye on Clayton.

GERTIE	I think we need to keep an eye on each other.

GERTIE	You heard what he said,

GERTIE	we're all prisoners here.

CLIVE	Well, this prisoner is tired.

CLIVE	I'm out.

RUBEN	Yeah.	

CLIVE	Deuces.

RUBEN	Yeah, I need a smoke

RUBEN	I need a smoke break.

RICK	Are you leaving?

GERTIE	You all right, honey?

JENNIFER	No, Gertie, probably not.

JENNIFER	I don't think any of us are gonna be okay.

JENNIFER	I know you're here.

ADAM	You looking for something?

JENNIFER	It's you.

ADAM	What? Do we know each other?

JENNIFER	I think we kind of do.

ADAM	Who are you?

ADAM	You look so familiar.

ADAM	You were at the diner back in town.

JENNIFER	No, but I know what happened.

ADAM	Yeah, everyone knows what happened.

JENNIFER	No, it's not like that.

JENNIFER	I know more, I know why.

ADAM	What are you talking about?

JENNIFER	Who are you?

ADAM REACTING	Oh my God.

JENNIFER	How did we miss you?

ADAM	Did I hit you?

JENNIFER	You threw me.

ADAM	What? Wait a minute, who Who's we?

ADAM	What do you mean, "We missed you?"

JENNIFER	You are TK, just like me.

ADAM	TK?

JENNIFER	Telekinetic.

JENNIFER	You threw me with your mind.

ADAM	Where are we?
	
JENNIFER	Looked safe, hidden.

ADAM	Who are you?	
	
JENNIFER	Jennifer and you are Adam.

ADAM	How did you know who I am?

JENNIFER	No. Not again.

ADAM	What? What's going on?	

JENNIFER	Give me your phone.

ADAM	No, why?

JENNIFER	Please, I need to see the news, please.

JENNIFER	This is impossible.

JENNIFER	Why would they do this?

ADAM	Why would who do what?

NEWS ANCHOR OVER PHONE	Following up now on a string of earthquakes

NEWS ANCHOR OVER PHONE	that struck the California desert.

NEWS ANCHOR OVER PHONE	It seems the entire Western Seaboard

NEWS ANCHOR	is now on high alert.

NEWS ANCHOR	Reports coming in out of San Francisco of a 9. 8 earthquake

NEWS ANCHOR	and also unconfirmed reports

NEWS ANCHOR	have the death toll currently

NEWS ANCHOR	in the thousands.

NEWS ANCHOR	Keep it right here with us, we'll be sure to give you more details

NEWS ANCHOR	as soon as they become available.

GEN. WHITE	You wanna tell me what the hell is going on?

GEN. WHITE	We just lost San Francisco.

SECURITY CHIEF	Sir?

GEN. WHITE		What is it, soldier?

SECURITY CHIEF	She's nowhere to be found on base.

SECURITY CHIEF	Few of the guys heard some noise last night and now a vehicle's missing.

SECURITY CHIEF	All the vehicles have GPS. I'll find her.

COL. CLAYTON	Then what in the hell are you waiting for?

GEN. WHITE	Let me get this straight, you're telling me that

GEN. WHITE	this all caused by one woman?

GEN. WHITE	You categorically told me, colonel, that this machine

GEN. WHITE	cannot operate without the group so what the hell is it?

GERTIE	Jennifer would never be involved in something like this.

GEN. WHITE	Okay, let's get things straight.

GEN. WHITE	Targeting goes haywire, she goes missing, then this.

GEN. WHITE	Now, now, who the hell is this guy?

COL. CLAYTON	He was in Mojave.

COL. CLAYTON	Not a scratch on him, all fire's raining down on that town.

COL. CLAYTON	They're in this together.

COL. CLAYTON	You saw the way that she reacted to him.

COL. CLAYTON	I'm telling you Jennifer Gaines has gone rogue.

RICK	She has been acting kind of weird lately.

GERTIE	Why, Rick, because she's not falling for you?

RICK	No.

COL. CLAYTON	Then you explain it!	

COL. CLAYTON	She's the seer,

COL. CLAYTON	and she focuses all of your powers.

RICK	I can focus my damn self.

RUBEN	No, no.

RUBEN	We We can all do our own thing but she's the antenna.

RUBEN	We can't.

GEN. WHITE	Is that right?

RUBEN	Yeah.	

GEN. WHITE	That's interesting, Colonel?

COL. CLAYTON	Yes?

GEN. WHITE	Sounds to me like this operation is compromised.

GEN. WHITE	All system's to be downed effective immediately.

GEN. WHITE	Nobody goes in or out of this facility,

GEN. WHITE	and no one plugs in, is that clear?

GEN. WHITE	And that includes you, Colonel.

GEN. WHITE	Security chief.

GEN. WHITE	We're gonna need a sixman team,

GEN. WHITE	no footprint, no fatalities, bring them in alive.

GEN. WHITE	We get the girl, TK or no TK.

GEN. WHITE	Colonel...

GEN. WHITE	anything?

COL. CLAYTON	No, sir.

GEN. WHITE	Stay away from that machine.

GEN. WHITE	Let's go.

ADAM	And you expect me to believe all this just like that?

JENNIFER	You just tossed me across the room

JENNIFER	and you can't believe I'm psychic?

JENNIFER	Okay, put your hands behind your back

JENNIFER	and hold out as many fingers as you want.

ADAM	Are you serious?
JENNIFER	Do it.

ADAM	Whatever.

JENNIFER	Two.

JENNIFER	Three.

JENNIFER	Five.

JENNIFER	I can do this all day.

JENNIFER	Very funny.

ADAM	Magicians do this all the time.

ADAM	There's always a trick involved.

JENNIFER	You know, I totally thought you'd be more openminded than this,

JENNIFER	but hard way it is then.

ADAM	What the hell? You could’ve killed me.

JENNIFER	No, I couldn't have.

JENNIFER	Things like that have been happening around your whole life, right?

JENNIFER	Right?

JENNIFER	You're TK.

JENNIFER	Your subconscious will protect you no matter what.

ADAM	What's this? Like, some kind of mutant thing?

ADAM	Like the comic books?

JENNIFER	Yeah, that's kind of what this is.

JENNIFER	I'm a Seer,

JENNIFER	but you're a whole lot more than that.

JENNIFER	Are you freaking crazy?

ADAM	Test passed.

ADAM	You knew it was coming.

JENNIFER	Something's wrong.

JENNIFER	Oh, my God, they're here.

ADAM	Who's here? What are you talking about?

JENNIFER	Strike Team.

ADAM	What's Strike Team?

JENNIFER	We got to go, run.

ADAM	All right. Let's go.
		
JENNIFER	No, no, this way.

SPEC OPS LEADER	Don't move!

SPEC OPS LEADER	I'm taking you back.

JENNIFER	That's not happening.

SPEC OPS LEADER	Just do what I'm saying!

JENNIFER	Not going back.

JENNIFER	Keep doing what you're doing.
ADAM	I don't even know what the hell I'm doing!

JENNIFER	Adam.

JENNIFER	Okay, run.

JENNIFER	Run.

ADAM	Who the hell are those guys?

JENNIFER	PMB Strike Team.

ADAM	PMB?

JENNIFER	Project MindBlown.

JENNIFER	Long story, we got to go.

ADAM	How am I doing all this?

JENNIFER	I can't explain it now, we were all trained.

ADAM	There's more of you?

JENNIFER	If he's using them somehow, we are in deep shit.

ADAM	Move, move.

SPEC OPS LEADER	Don't move!

ADAM	I'm sorry.
		
JENNIFER	Do as he says.

SPEC OPS LEADER	Subject Gains.

SPEC OPS LEADER	You will come back in with me now!

SPEC OPS LEADER	I will put you both down.

JENNIFER	Adam, I'm your other.

JENNIFER	I'm your magnifier, you can amplify all this.

SPEC OPS LEADER/JENNIFER	Do you understand me?

JENNIFER	Whatever I do, just imagine it stronger,

JENNIFER	more powerful.

SPEC OPS LEADER/JENNIFER	On your knees now!

ADAM REACTING	Holy shit.

JENNIFER	I know.

JENNIFER	Let's go.

JENNIFER	We need to get out of here.	

ADAM	L.A.	

ADAM	It's easy to disappear.

ADAM	We got to go. They tracked you here.

JENNIFER	What are you doing?	

ADAM	They can probably track	

ADAM	my cell phone, too, you know, triangulate the signal or whatever.
	
JENNIFER	Yeah, they don't your cell phone to do that.

ADAM	Jesus, really?

COL. CLAYTON	Spec Ops team is down.

COL. CLAYTON	Jennifer and the unknown are together.

COL. CLAYTON	He deflected gunfire.

COL. CLAYTON	Let that sink in.

COL. CLAYTON	A rogue, untrained TK with the ability to do that

COL. CLAYTON	and who the hell knows what else.

RUBEN	Who Who can do that?

RUBEN	Clive, can you do that?		

CLIVE	No way.

GERTIE	This doesn't make sense.

COL. CLAYTON	It makes perfect sense.

COL. CLAYTON	TK terrorism

COL. CLAYTON	We've got to find them and stop them

COL. CLAYTON	before they strike again.

COL. CLAYTON	This is national security, protocol delta.

GERTIE	You all know Jennifer

GERTIE	and you know that she didn't do this.

RICK	Do we?

COL. CLAYTON	Maybe she's being coerced.

COL. CLAYTON	Maybe he has the power to control minds.

COL. CLAYTON	She can do that.

COL. CLAYTON	We can't leave anything to speculation.

COL. CLAYTON	It is all possible, you know that.

RICK	Well, whatever, okay?

RICK	We have to figure out how they hacked us.

RICK	Look, I don't need her to power up.

RICK	I got this.

COL. CLAYTON	Then you tap in and you find them.

SECURITY CHIEF	Sir, Gen. White asked us not to tap in.

COL. CLAYTON	Do you see Gen. White anywhere?

COL. CLAYTON	I don't see Gen. White anywhere around here.

COL. CLAYTON	This is my project, this is my op.

COL. CLAYTON	I said plug in.

RUBEN	Hey, you busy?

GERTIE	Are you okay?

RUBEN	No, I'm not okay.

RUBEN	There's something seriously wrong going on.

GERTIE	Yeah, there's something seriously wrong going on.

GERTIE	There's something seriously wrong going on with everything.

RUBEN	This isn't Jennifer.

GERTIE	Of course not.

RUBEN	Yeah, and I feel like I'm being forced to choose right now.

GERTIE	You are.

GERTIE	Make no mistake.

GERTIE	We're being used.

RUBEN	What, by the government?

GERTIE	By the government, by Clayton,

GERTIE	by the whole freaking thing.

GERTIE	We did this to help people,

GERTIE	and now...

GERTIE	the thing that we swore to protect people from

GERTIE	we'd become.

RUBEN	Yeah, Rick and Clive, they're not right anymore.

RUBEN	And the machine,

RUBEN	so it amplifies our abilities, right?

RUBEN	Do you think maybe it also amplifies

RUBEN	just who we are

RUBEN	Who we are as people inside?

GERTIE	I don't feel any different.	

RUBEN	Well, exactly because

RUBEN	you're a good person, but the Colonel and Rick,

RUBEN	you know, especially the Colonel, he has not been the picture

RUBEN	of mental health recently, you know.

RUBEN	And Rick, he just He's been tripping way more than normal.

RUBEN	He's just such an angry guy.

GERTIE	What about Clive then?

RUBEN	He just does whatever Rick says.

RUBEN	He wants his approval so bad.

GERTIE	If what you're saying is true,

GERTIE	then we have to protect Jennifer

GERTIE	even if it's from them.

RUBEN	Jesus.

RUBEN	How did it even come to this?

GERTIE	How does anything come to anything?

GERTIE	Powerful men and their greed.

GERTIE	Don't worry, kid,

GERTIE	it's gonna be okay.

RUBEN	Yeah.
RUBEN	Thanks.

ADAM	So, how is this all possible?

JENNIFER	Well, telekinetics have been around

JENNIFER	for millennia, right?

JENNIFER	Shamans, demigods,

JENNIFER	magic, the force.

JENNIFER	Whatever people have called it,

JENNIFER	some humans got unexplainable powers.

JENNIFER	And the government found five of us years ago.

JENNIFER	Trained us as part of an experimental program

JENNIFER	for the Department of Defense.

ADAM	But how could they destroy a whole city?

JENNIFER	We all have different abilities.

JENNIFER	I'm the strongest as a Seer.

JENNIFER	The others can manipulate the elements.

JENNIFER	Energy resonates at different frequencies

JENNIFER	including brainwaves, they can tap into that.

ADAM	They figured out how to weaponize it?

JENNIFER	Project MindBlown.

JENNIFER	That's what they call it.

JENNIFER	It's a top secret Pentagon program

JENNIFER	that combines all of our abilities

JENNIFER	and amplifies it through a satellite network.

JENNIFER	So, anywhere I can see in my mind,

JENNIFER	we can affect.

ADAM	So, you're a soldier?

JENNIFER	Volunteer actually.

ADAM	You signed up for this?

JENNIFER	Look, I thought we could help people, you know.

JENNIFER	Bring rain to drought areas,

JENNIFER	uncover landslide victims,

JENNIFER	things like that, but I was wrong.

JENNIFER	It was supposed to be a mock trial,

JENNIFER	ended up destroying your town.

JENNIFER	That is when I saw you, felt you,

JENNIFER	it was like we were connected.

JENNIFER	And I knew that Colonel would come after you

JENNIFER	and if you didn’t join the team,

JENNIFER	he'd see you as a threat.
ADAM	So, you came just for me?

JENNIFER	I don't know why I came.

JENNIFER	I just knew it was the right thing to do.

JENNIFER	I've never felt another TK like you.

JENNIFER	And when I saw what happened

JENNIFER	in San Francisco,

JENNIFER	I knew the Colonel was involved.

JENNIFER	I know there's something more.

JENNIFER	I heard his thoughts, felt his fear.

JENNIFER	He is not what he appears.

JENNIFER	We have to stop him.

ADAM	There's no we.

JENNIFER	Yes, there is and you know it.

JENNIFER	What are you doing? We need to keep moving.

ADAM	How the hell are we supposed to stop them?

JENNIFER	We can do this.

ADAM	Why can't we just go to the FBI or something?

JENNIFER	They are the government.

ADAM	Then, we'll just hide.

JENNIFER	We're psychic, don't you see, there's no hiding.

ADAM	I can't do this.

JENNIFER	What?

JENNIFER	Let me help you, tell me.

JENNIFER	Tell me.

ADAM	I couldn't save them.

ADAM	I was totally fine, but they were dead.

ADAM	I went from home to home,

ADAM	some decent foster parents, some not so great.

ADAM	But no matter what,

ADAM	the moment the weird stuff happened around me,

ADAM	I was sent packing.

JENNIFER	I wanna show you something.

YOUNG JENNIFER	Row, row, row your boat

YOUNG JENNIFER	gently down the stream.

YOUNG JENNIFER	Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

YOUNG JENNIFER	life is like a dream.

YOUNG JENNIFER	Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream...

DAD	Jennifer, would you stop	 that damn song?

YOUNG JENNIFER	Row, row, row your boat
YOUNG JENNIFER	gently down the stream, merrily...

DAD	Stop	 the damn song!

YOUNG JENNIFER	Row, row, row your boat

YOUNG JENNIFER	gently down the stream.

DAD	Shut up, shut up!

DAD	When I say stop, you stop. Stop	 the song...

YOUNG JENNIFER	Stop dad.

DAD	...stop...	

YOUNG JENNIFER	Stop!

DAD	Don't tell me to stop!

YOUNG JENNIFER	Row, row, row your boat gently...

DAD	Shut up, do not disobey me!

YOUNG JENNIFER	Stop dad!

DAD	You don't yell at me...

YOUNG JENNIFER	Stop dad!

DAD	...you don't yell at me!

YOUNG JENNIFER	Hey, we're gonna crash!

DAD	Stop!
	
YOUNG JENNIFER	No!

JENNIFER	He was never...

JENNIFER	going to stop...

JENNIFER	ever.

JENNIFER	But that is when I realized

JENNIFER	the things that we can do

JENNIFER	and learn to use it to harness it,

JENNIFER	so no one could ever hurt me again.

JENNIFER	What happened on that road

JENNIFER	haunts me to this day,

JENNIFER	but I can't live in the past,

JENNIFER	not anymore.

JENNIFER	We are the same.

JENNIFER	We have no one else.

ADAM	I guess we got each other now, right?

JENNIFER	Yeah.

JENNIFER	Hey, stop fighting it.

JENNIFER	Fight it, it hurts more.

JENNIFER	Stop blocking yourself.

ADAM	I can see them.

JENNIFER	Focus.

JENNIFER	Relax.

JENNIFER	They're transmitting, looking for us.

ADAM	There's four of them.

JENNIFER	Yeah.

ADAM	If I can see them, can they see me?

JENNIFER	Not for long.

JENNIFER	Let's send it back.

RICK	Damn, it's just not working.

CLIVE	We can't focus without a Seer.

COL. CLAYTON	We got to find them.

GERTIE	How are you so sure it's them?

CLIVE	Let me try, I've had the sight sometimes.

CLIVE	I can do this.

COL. CLAYTON	Do it.

COL. CLAYTON	Right there.

COL. CLAYTON	We got them.

COL. CLAYTON	What the hell happened?

CLIVE	They blocked us out.

COL. CLAYTON	How?	
RICK	Jennifer, you bitch.

GERTIE	Hey.
		
CLIVE	Na, she is with him,	

CLIVE	they're in on it.

COL. CLAYTON	Do you know where they are?

CLIVE	Not where they are,

CLIVE	but we know where they're going.

SECURITY CHIEF	I'm on it.

JENNIFER	I've never seen L.A. like this before.

ADAM	My parents used to take me here when I was a kid,

ADAM	see the sights,

ADAM	the observatory, theme parks, all that.

ADAM	Spent a lot of time out here,

ADAM	running from what I was.

ADAM	Figured small town life was easier way

ADAM	to stay low profile,

ADAM	you know what I mean?

ADAM	What's that for?

JENNIFER	Practice?

ADAM	But we just did all that back there.

JENNIFER	Yeah, but, you didn't do it alone.

JENNIFER	You need control, it can't be reflex,

JENNIFER	it has to be direct.

JENNIFER	Okay.

JENNIFER	Feel the elements around you,

JENNIFER	hear your heart.

JENNIFER	Root yourself into the Earth.

JENNIFER	Focus,

JENNIFER	smell the air,

JENNIFER	touch the wind.

JENNIFER	Remember, when you move your arm,

JENNIFER	you don't think about it,

JENNIFER	you just do it.

JENNIFER	That's what this is like.

JENNIFER	Good.

JENNIFER	So, kindergarten is over.

JENNIFER	But now, we're gonna fast track.

JENNIFER	So, I want you to fry the can.

ADAM	What?

JENNIFER	Zap it.

ADAM	With what, lightning?	

JENNIFER	Yeah.

ADAM	How am I supposed to do that?

JENNIFER	Picture it in your mind and boom.

ADAM	Okay.

RICK	I got them!

SPEC OPS LEADER	Colonel, green nonlethals?

COL. CLAYTON OVER RADIO	Affirmative SnakeEyes, shoot to kill.

COL. CLAYTON OVER RADIO	This ends now.

GERTIE	No, we can't do this.

ADAM	Jennifer!

ADAM	Jennifer!

ADAM	Jennifer, can you hear me?

ADAM	Jennifer!

ADAM	Jennifer!

ADAM	Jennifer, you okay?

JENNIFER	I'm stuck, I can't move.

ADAM	I can't move it.

JENNIFER	We can do this together.

JENNIFER	Ready?

JENNIFER	Come on.

JENNIFER	I need you to focus.

JENNIFER	Ready?

JENNIFER	Gonna help me up there, cowboy?

ADAM	Are you all right?	

JENNIFER	Yeah.

JENNIFER	Nice work.

ADAM	I didn't know I could do that.

SPEC OPS LEADER	This ends now.

SPEC OPS LEADER	You see a clear shot, you take them down.

RICK	Hey, man, you ready?

RICK	Don't punk out on me, man remember, they'd do the same to us.

RICK/RUBEN	And you two.

RICK/RUBEN	You pull that hippie bleeding heart crap,

RICK/RUBEN	you could stay your asses in this chopper.

RUBEN	Rick, seriously, you're tripping.

RUBEN	There's something else going on here, man.

RICK	They killed millions, Ruben.

RICK	They're too dangerous to live.

RUBEN	Yeah, if you think Jennifer really did all this,

RUBEN	then you didn't really know her in the first place, did you?

GERTIE	Get a clue, kid they're using us.

RUBEN	She couldn't do this alone.

RICK/RUBEN	Exactly. Hey, it's him.

RICK/RUBEN	He's got to go.

RICK/RUBEN	Scratch that, they got to go.

ADAM	L.A.

ADAM	Gone.

JENNIFER	I can't believe Clayton would do this.

JENNIFER	All those people.

ADAM	Millions.

ADAM	How are they doing this without you?

JENNIFER	I don't know.

JENNIFER	We function in pairs.

JENNIFER	Rick is fire and air, he's connected		,

JENNIFER	who does Earth.

JENNIFER	Gertie is water, Ruben is lightning,
JENNIFER	and they do their thing.

JENNIFER	I'm the Seer, psychic,

JENNIFER	the one who harnesses it all and aims their power.

JENNIFER	Gives them the direction to project weather patterns

JENNIFER	hundreds of miles away.

JENNIFER	We all have a touch of each other's abilities,

JENNIFER	but nothing major.

JENNIFER	Nothing like when I focus them.

ADAM	So, who's your pair?

ADAM	Me.

JENNIFER	Look, you're strong,

JENNIFER	I'm strong.

JENNIFER	And together, we're something different.

JENNIFER	They can't levitate things,

JENNIFER	alter reality, create force fields,

JENNIFER	but we can.

ADAM	I could always do it a little, but...

ADAM	right before our town got hit,

ADAM	I saved this lady.

ADAM	I tossed a truck across the yard.

JENNIFER	They were targeting your town that day.

JENNIFER	My sight was projected to your area.

ADAM	And it made me stronger.

JENNIFER	It released your power.

JENNIFER	That's what the headaches were.

JENNIFER	They never could have anticipated another TK like you.

ADAM	Guess it was fate.

JENNIFER	Maybe it was.

JENNIFER	They found us.

JENNIFER	We got to go.

RICK	Clive, you and me.

RICK	You two do whatever the hell you're gonna do.

SPEC OPS LEADER/ADAM	Stop, don't move.

JENNIFER	Oh, my God.

JENNIFER	Gertie. We got to go.

RUBEN	Go look over there.

CLIVE	Jennifer, what are you doing?

CLIVE	You got to come back.

JENNIFER	No, I'm not going.
CLIVE	You are our leader.

CLIVE	This is your warning.

JENNIFER	What are you doing?

CLIVE	Don't make me do this.

GERTIE	Clive, stop.

GERTIE	What are you doing?

GERTIE	Jen.

JENNIFER	Gertie.	

GERTIE	Are you okay?		

JENNIFER	Yeah.	

GERTIE	Clive, listen to me.

GERTIE	It's not them.

GERTIE	You're not right.

RICK	Gertie, you better move.

GERTIE	No, Jennifer is my friend.

GERTIE	She's our friend, Rick.

RICK	Not anymore.

JENNIFER	No!

JENNIFER	How could you?

JENNIFER	How could you?

RICK	Come on, Adam.

RICK	Let's see what you got.

RICK	You turned her against me.

RUBEN	Rick.

RICK	Ruben.

RICK	Don't punk out on me, too, man.

RUBEN	Clive, I'll zap you before you could touch the ground.

RUBEN	Don't make me do it.

JENNIFER	It's three on one, Clive.

JENNIFER	It ends now.
	
CLIVE	Come on.

MAN	We're coming to take you home.

MAN	We're coming to take you home.

MAN	Take you home.

MAN	Take you home.

MAN	We're coming to take you home.

MAN	We're coming to take you home.

MAN	We're coming to take you home.

MAN	 Take you home. Take you home.
MAN	 Take you home. Take you home.

MAN	 Take you home. Take you home.

MAN	 Yeah, you got it all.

JENNIFER	Damn it, Clive.

JENNIFER	I told you not to do it.

RUBEN	No, him and Rick, they weren't right anymore.

RUBEN	They were gonna kill us, trust me.

RUBEN	Are you okay?

JENNIFER	Yeah.

RUBEN	She was like a mom to me.

JENNIFER	I know.

JENNIFER	We're going back.

JENNIFER	Where'd you land?

RUBEN	Uh, I know a guy who knows.

COL. CLAYTON	Red Team!

COL. CLAYTON	Omega override. Get in here now.

COL. CLAYTON	Now, move.

COL. CLAYTON	You hear anything on the other side of that door,

COL. CLAYTON	you shoot first.

COL. CLAYTON	Understand?

COL. CLAYTON	Time to clean shop.

COL. CLAYTON	Execute.

RUBEN TO PILOT	Fly casual, man.

RUBEN TO PILOT	One flick and I'll stop your heart.

JENNIFER	You're gonna tell us what the hell is going on.

SPEC OPS LEADER	Good luck.

SPEC OPS LEADER	Go ahead, kid.

SPEC OPS LEADER	It ain't gonna matter.

SPEC OPS LEADER/ADAM	In one hour,

SPEC OPS LEADER	we'll all be living in a new age.

ADAM	What's this? Some maniac's plan to throw the world

ADAM	into anarchy, is that it?

ADAM	Isn't that one played out by now?

SPEC OPS LEADER	Do your worst. I ain't talking.

JENNIFER	You don't need to.

SPEC OPS LEADER	Stop.

SPEC OPS LEADER	Get out of my head.

JENNIFER/RUBEN	Oh, God. He's done it.

JENNIFER/RUBEN	He found a way to use the weapon without us.

JENNIFER/RUBEN	He's targeting DC.

RUBEN	What?

ADAM	The White House?

ADAM	He's taking out Washington?

SPEC OPS LEADER	It's over.

RUBEN	What are we gonna do?

ADAM	It's up to us, right?

JENNIFER	You still got a back way into the compound?

RUBEN	How else do you think I've been getting my weed in

RUBEN	for the past year?

JENNIFER	I got this.

PILOT	Helo1, en route.

PILOT	ETA 20 minutes.

PILOT	Zero cargo, PMB.

PILOT	Total loss at target site.

PILOT	Am I good for landing site B?

LAB TECH	We've been shut down.

COL. CLAYTON	Take it all offline now.

GEN. WHITE OVER SPEAKER	Clayton,

GEN. WHITE OVER SPEAKER	on behalf of the Department of Defense, we're shutting you down.

GEN. WHITE	Effective immediately.

COL. CLAYTON	General,

COL. CLAYTON	has it come to this?

GEN. WHITE OVER SPEAKER	You're an enemy of the State.

COL. CLAYTON	Hmm?

COL. CLAYTON	Me? I'm kind of honored.

COL. CLAYTON	Thank you.

GEN. WHITE	We've been tracking your energy output.

GEN. WHITE	Project Mindblown has been active during every attack.

GEN. WHITE	Or do you think we haven't been watching your every move?

GEN. WHITE OVER SPEAKER	Hundreds of thousands

GEN. WHITE	of American lives.

GEN. WHITE	You're a terrorist.

COL. CLAYTON	General, that's a low blow.

COL. CLAYTON	No <makes noise> no, no, no, no,

COL. CLAYTON	I'm not a terrorist, no.

COL. CLAYTON	I'm a revolutionary.

GEN. WHITE	 What are you doing?

COL. CLAYTON OVER SPEAKER	General, this project

COL. CLAYTON	is about manipulating the energy.

COL. CLAYTON OVER SPEAKER	We've been selfpowered for oh, God, I don't know,

COL. CLAYTON	eight months.

COL. CLAYTON	We're off the grid.

COL. CLAYTON	Pretty soon you will be, too.

GEN. WHITE	Shut it down now!

GEN. WHITE	I'm warning you, Clayton. We have bombers inbound.

GEN. WHITE	This is your last chance.

COL. CLAYTON	You have inbound bombers

COL. CLAYTON	against a facility that controls the weather.

COL. CLAYTON	My tornadoes will rip apart your bombers.

COL. CLAYTON	Ladies?

LAB TECH #1	Yes, sir.

COL. CLAYTON	Prep for target launch.

GEN. WHITE	DEFCON 1, clear the White House now.

GEN. WHITE	Let them know an attack is imminent.

WOMAN#9	Yes, sir.

RUBEN	Hey, are you sure the pilot is secure?

JENNIFER	Memory wipe. He’ll be passed out for a day.

ADAM	Can we get in this way?

RUBEN	Trust me. This is my spot, man.

RUBEN	They’re all magnetically sealed. A couple of volts <indistinct>...

ADAM/JENNIFER	Right. Jen, lead the way.

JENNIFER	The control room is that way. We can take it from the inside.

ADAM	Hey, that colonel still thinks you were taken out

ADAM	with the rest, so they won’t be expecting you.

RUBEN	Okay, I'll take out the guards

RUBEN	and I'll meet guys back at Pod Central.

JENNIFER/JENNIFER	They know we're here. Let's go, let's go.

JENNIFER/JENNIFER	We need to shut down the backup power grid. It can't work without the relays.

ADAM	Do you know where that is?	
JENNIFER	I know these power lines

JENNIFER	lead somewhere.

ADAM	Get me there, I'll find a way to shut them down.

RUBEN	Unplug it now, Colonel.

COL. CLAYTON	Really? You can’t unplug while the system is online.

COL. CLAYTON	You know that.

COL. CLAYTON	Besides,

COL. CLAYTON	I got a mission to complete.

RUBEN	Do it now or I'll fry the control panel.

COL. CLAYTON	Ruben, we're live.

COL. CLAYTON	Why don't you go ahead?

COL. CLAYTON	Go, go, go, go, go.

COL. CLAYTON	Do the best you can. Go, go, give it the ball.

RUBEN	You're losing it.

RUBEN	You're out of your mind, Colonel.

COL. CLAYTON	Where are your friends, Ruben?

RUBEN	They're running late.

COL. CLAYTON	You were always the smart ass.

RUBEN	Yeah, you were always a dick.

COL. CLAYTON	Yeah, well, you know what?

COL. CLAYTON	You can't stop this.

COL. CLAYTON	None of you can

COL. CLAYTON	because system is online.

COL. CLAYTON	You kill me, my mission completes.

COL. CLAYTON	This is a new age, son.

RUBEN	That's it.

JENNIFER	We have to rip it apart from the inside out.

COL. CLAYTON	The funny thing about this is...

COL. CLAYTON	every time I use your cloned frequencies,

COL. CLAYTON	I will come back a little with your power.

COL. CLAYTON	Our brains adapt.

JENNIFER	Oh my God, Ruben.

JENNIFER	It's Clayton. He's got him.

COL. CLAYTON	You stay out of my way.

COL. CLAYTON	Oh, Jennifer.

COL. CLAYTON	You and the new TK, you're a little bit late

COL. CLAYTON	because my mission is complete.

COL. CLAYTON	Say good bye to Washington.

COL. CLAYTON	I surrender.

COL. CLAYTON	Take me in.

ADAM	You can stop this.

COL. CLAYTON	No, I can't.

COL. CLAYTON	We set this up to run on its own

COL. CLAYTON	the minute I sent the signal out.

JENNIFER	This can't be it, there has to be a way. We destroyed the grid.

COL. CLAYTON	But you didn't destroy the signal.

COL. CLAYTON	Once you think a thought, that thought leaves your mind.

COL. CLAYTON	You can't get it back.

COL. CLAYTON	You can't unthink a thought.

COL. CLAYTON	It's out there.

COL. CLAYTON	I was able to get a little of everyone's abilities

COL. CLAYTON	except for yours, Jennifer.

COL. CLAYTON	I couldn't quite figure out

COL. CLAYTON	how to get the sight.

JENNIFER	That's because I never had my pair.

COL. CLAYTON	That's right, and now you do.

COL. CLAYTON	What a fitting end

COL. CLAYTON	to your sucky little love story.

COL. CLAYTON	You got to see the new age!

COL. CLAYTON	You go

COL. CLAYTON	or I go.

COL. CLAYTON	It don't make any difference to me.

COL. CLAYTON	Welcome to the revolution!

JENNIFER/ADAM	Go.

JENNIFER	We can stop Washington.

ADAM	That's halfway across the damn country.

JENNIFER	Not in your mind. I will guide us in.

JENNIFER	See what I see.

ADAM	I can't.

JENNIFER	Focus.

JENNIFER	Calm your breathing.

JENNIFER	Together, okay?

ADAM	That kind of helps, I ain't gonna lie.

JENNIFER	We can do this.

ADAM	All right.

JENNIFER	Fight it.

RUBEN	Is it over? Did you do it?

RUBEN	You save Washington?

RUBEN	Oh, my God. Guys, this means we're heroes.

RICK	You should’ve finished me back on the hill.

JENNIFER	There is no one left.

JENNIFER	This is over.

JENNIFER	He used us.

RICK	You think this is about Clayton?

RICK	This is about you and him.

ADAM	It doesn't have to end like this.

RICK	Sure, it does.

JENNIFER	The system messed you up, Rick,

JENNIFER	messed with your mind.

JENNIFER	We can find a way to move on. Can't you see?

RICK	We could be gods,

RICK	but there's only room for one.

RICK	You took her from us.

RICK	You took her from me.

JENNIFER	Adam.

ADAM	You killed your own people.

ADAM	You killed You tried to kill her.

JENNIFER	You wanna know why I never fell for you, Rick?

JENNIFER	Because you were always an asshole.

JENNIFER	This ends now.
