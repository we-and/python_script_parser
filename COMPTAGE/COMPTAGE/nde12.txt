JANG HAK-SOO 	It's a bloodbath.

RYU	Here is the report of our troop placement. 226th Infantry Regiment is in Incheon. 918th Artillery Regiment, 2nd battalion is stationed there. 2,048 infantry, 231 in Artillery Regiment, and 487 in 42nd Armored Vehicle Regiment.


10 (01:07:27:02)

RYU	Considering Incheon's geography, the enemy can only access land routes from Gimpo, Siheung, and Hwaseong. AV units and artillery units are stationed at each location. Incheon harbor is fortified by 6m-high seawalls, making it impossible to climb over.

JANG HAK-SOO	What is the best defense if the American bastards attack by sea?

RYU		There is only one narrow channel into the bay they could access. One disabled landing boat could completely block the entrance. Once it's blocked off, we'll use a 76mm artillery gun barrage to wipe them out. That is all.


11 (01:08:06:05)

JANG HAK-SOO	Comrade Lieutenant. 76mm artillery guns would be useless. If the landing boats get to shore, it's all over. They must be stopped at sea. Also... why no mention of naval mines? Are they not set?

LIM		We lined the waterway with them.

JANG HAK-SOO	You marked them clearly on a map then? Bring it to me.

42 (01:25:46:18)

LIM	But that's it! Know your enemy and yourself, you can win all wars! Supreme Commander, do you know what MacArthur wants?

MAC ARTHUR	I fight wars to win. Operation Chromite is the only way to victory.

VANDENBERG	Operation Chromite... It's a cute name. You intentionally delay reporting to us your plans. You wait until we get here all the way from Washington. Then you not only insult us, but the President of the United States. And then you have one plan with no recourse! One plan! Why? Why the fixation on Incheon?


43 (01:26:26:23)
