??	The day this country believes that with merit, beauty, emotions, having deserved it, it is easier to win, on that day we will have taken a big step forward.

??	We still haven't realised that it is easier to win if we play well.

??	When you're a coach, you know players play for you on the national team but then they go back to their own clubs. I've always said to them,

??	"Remember you play for two teams.

??	One is your team, your club.

??	And the other more important one is that the dream of every young boy, of every footballer is to play for Italy."

??	They say one's aim in life is to find an aim in life.

??	And at this stage of my life

??	I have found one.

??	I want to be here, to hug the players before they go onto the pitch and off to battle.

??	Football never changes, there are eleven players, a football, you have to score goals.

??	That's what we want to do, we want to dominate the pitch.

??	There's no other place in the world a man's happier in than in a stadium.

??	These are the words of the French writer, Albert Camus. And tomorrow the Italian team will try to make the fans in the stadium happy.
??	But also the millions watching the match from home.

??	Before kick-off, the players will sing the national anthem, and they won't be alone.

??	Listening to them, we might think the worst is over, that we are about to return to normality.

??	Mancini's boys will attempt to win and make this moment perfect.

??	But before the show begins, we will follow them along the last stage of their journey.

??	We are about to tell you about an Italian Dream.

??	We remember the matches of the

??	Italian team, good and bad episodes, the victories and the defeats.

??	But how do we get that far? What are the emotions on the eve of the game?

??	The moment when you get together before the matches is fundamental.

??	That's when fortune or misfortune is decided... for the national team, as you live in close contact with the players, and it becomes a club.

??	It becomes a club and they need to feel they belong to it, they have to feel what it means to wear that shirt, what it means to be the bearer of the values of a whole nation.

??	You don't have to give the team motivational speeches.

??	They're already motivated and determined on their own account.

??	In fact, you have to try and calm them down, and joke when possible, otherwise the tension can be bad for them.

??	Paradoxically, it's the easiest moment, because the players are already motivated on their own.

??	I was always very tense, with many doubts and uncertainties.

??	And when I woke up in the morning, the first idea that came to me was the winning one.

??	I think playing in these competitions such as the European or World cups... is something beautiful, unbelievable, but at the same time it puts enormous pressure on you, because you know that behind you the wind of a nation blows.

??	LEONARDO BONUCCI'S HOME

??	I can't wait...

??	CIRO IMMOBILE'S HOME ..to get back in the stadium.

??	It's strange.

??	After more than a year.

??	It will feel strange to see people there, because , are a lot of people.

??	After a year without fans...

??	To go from zero to ,...

??	Is it different when it's empty?

??	Yeah, darling, because it's the fans who give you that bit extra, when you're a goal down, maybe, or else... after a goal.

??	FRANCESCO ACERBI'S HOME

??	What time do you leave tomorrow?

??	In the morning, love.

??	I don't have to take a lot, we'll get everything there.

??	I'll pack my phone charger tomorrow morning.

??	Okay. Socks, underwear?

??	No, they'll give us everything.

??	For the retreat... and I don't need anything else for the matches.

??	I'll finish packing tomorrow.

??	Are you raring to go?

??	Yes, I'm raring to go.

??	What's the first match?

??	Against Turkey.

??	We have to win.

??	It'll be a great Cup.

??	LEONARDO BONUCCI'S HOME

??	Come in, Giorgione.

??	How's it going?

??	Good.

??	Come in.

??	It's nearly time.

??	After three years.

??	They kept us waiting.

??	They kept us waiting.

??	It's been a really long year.

??	For us, who have lots of young players who have matured even more, it's really been useful.

??	We've got a perfect mix.

??	The old players like us...

??	And these young players with an extra year of experience... it might sound nothing, but it's a long time.

??	Let's hope we have some fun, we're playing our last cards.

??	Let's hope so.

??	They really are my last.

??	What about you?

??	The very last.

??	You may have a few more.

??	Is it your last or not?

??	Yes, it really is my last.

??	Really?

??	But I reckon in this competition, as I said before, the coach has created the perfect mix.

??	I can't wait.

??	The fact that we are playing the first three games in Italy, the fans will be back, you're at

??	Coverciano, home from home, it's...

??	There so much enthusiasm.

??	It's great.

??	Late May, the  players chosen by Mancini have packed their bags and are heading for Coverciano, where they will train for the three games against Turkey,

??	Switzerland and Wales.

??	Andrea!

??	Have you human beings finished?

??	What Mancini wants is when we move the ball we cover the field slowly, with patience, we get in the striking positions and then add intensity.

??	Game, place kicks.

??	Are we having a game?

??	Yes, then place kicks.

??	Ciro, European Golden Shoe.

??	Can I add something personal?

??	Well done, well-deserved, not only because it's an individual award, it's everything you have achieved with the team.

??	And if you don't mind me saying so,

??	I see myself in you, though I didn't have to justify my presence with goals, but I knew what I had to do,

??	I had to run for Mancini.

??	But you're not as handsome as Ciro.

??	No.

??	I think, on behalf of everyone, that we too should have a moment of official recognition...

??	I'm not sure you've realised it, but the Golden Shoe is here with us now.

??	So, Ciro, I wish to congratulate you with all my heart.

??	Yes, well...

??	I feel really overwhelmed because being able to celebrate this here with you is very emotional.


??	Let's try and win something as a team too.

??	That would make me really happy.

??	Is that yours?

??	Let me smell.

??	An old painted shoe is a prank played on Ciro Immobile,

??	the best European goalscorer of .

??	Our chances of getting ahead in the tournament depend on his goals.

??	This is me.

??	Ciro and I have a special relationship.

??	On the pitch I call him "love",

??	I don't call him Ciro.

??	During training, in the changing-rooms...

??	Then last year, by chance, every time Ciro missed a goal, when there was a corner kick, or a penalty against us, I'd say,

??	"Come on, love, score a goal."

??	It happened two or three times and the next time he scored a goal.

??	So it became a kind of ritual.

??	We share this mutual respect and we're fond of one another.

??	I've known Ciro a long time.

??	I'm really very fond of him, he's a friend off the field too, in spite of having hated each other for  minutes per match for years.

??	When we're here, it's me, Lorenzo

??	Pellegrini, Gallo and Ciro.

??	We're practically together around the clock.

??	I get angry when Ciro, in the room, when it's ten degrees outside opens the window to let some fresh air in.

??	At night I feel I am sleeping with penguins, surrounded by ice.

??	When I open the window, he always wants it closed.

??	One, two, three, four.

??	Mancini knows the first rule for beating opponents is to know them.

??	That goes for tomorrow's opponents, the Turkish team.

??	Turkey is the first team we will be playing in our debut in the European Cup.

??	I know them rather well, because having coached in Turkey

??	I know the players.

??	It's a team that is changing, they have introduced many young players along with a few expert players.

??	They are a very dangerous team because they are an aggressive team with technically skilled players.

??	I think we need to be careful of them because they have some talented players.

??	We know some of them well, because they play or have played in Italy.

??	It's an opening match which has all the uncertainties of an opening match. If you get over that hurdle unharmed, or if we win, which we obviously hope we will, that will set the scene for our European tournament.

??	Before the video, let's have some information on the Turkish team.

??	Turkey is th in the FIFA rankings, th in the European ones.

??	Turkey had a good qualifying round for Euro , coming second, behind France.

??	They are a very moody team, because they give great performances, then mess up, like when they drew at home against Latvia.

??	In attack Turkey can play with a formation, or this formation, where Calhanoglu's position decides the structure.

??	Go on, go on!

??	I'll get rid of him, okay?

??	As soon as I'm free, get back!

??	Four defenders, three midfielders.

??	Get back, get back!

??	Mine!

??	But...

??	The ball passed to us by the full back has to be hard.

??	That's right.

??	Really hard.

??	Diagonally, right. A countermove, unless you leave half a metre...

??	Before the match, the coach gives us the formation and tactical advice on how to play the match, and his speech is very brief and intense.

??	But he always repeats the words "strength", "determined attack" and "patience".

??	It's obvious that determination and a desire to win are important values that you need to have, especially when wearing the Italian shirt.

??	Fede, if you take the ball and start to run, then slow down, the defender has the advantage, you don't have the speed you had before.

??	When you have it, go... extend it if you can, okay?

??	Don't stop, you go and stop. Then you want to set off from a standstill.

??	The defender might be useless, but it's hard to get away afterwards because he knows you play from right.

??	If we start to press...

??	Every time we start to press, they lose the ball, every time.

??	I think Mancini was very clever to work out the characteristics of the players that...

??	That are available to him.

??	He asks things at the right moment, he knows when and how to talk to them.

??	Zaniolo, Zaniolo is on his own!

??	Zaniolo!

??	Zaniolo scores his first goal...

??	He aims and finally scores!

??	Nicolò Zaniolo won't be among the  selected players.

??	He was one of the young players

??	Mancini was relying on.

??	Zaniolo gets back to the ball but falls after a clash with Van de Beek.

??	Zaniolo is shouting with pain from the blow.

??	The talented Roma player was unable to recover in time from his knee injury.

??	Zaniolo's story reminds the fans of another long wait for the return of another great Roma player shortly before the  World Cup.

??	Totti was injured one Sunday in February.

??	I was really worried, the World Cup was only three months away and I was afraid he wouldn't recover.

??	I went to Rome in the car and at : I was already at the clinic, in Francesco's room.

??	Totti looked at me and said,

??	"It's happened, unfortunately, it must have been destiny."

??	"What do you mean?" I said.

??	"I won't play in the World Cup."

??	"No, you will play in the World Cup."

??	"I spoke to Professor Mariani and he told me you will if you want to.

??	"If you work hard."

??	I hadn't spoken to Professor Mariani,

??	I was bluffing.

??	But he worked really hard, and he gave his contribution to the World Cup.

??	Grosso.

??	ITALYAUSTRALIA

??	JUNE , 

??	It's a penalty kick! A penalty kick!

??	I remember watching the match with my family and when they awarded the penalty,

??	I got really excited.

??	And I remember the concentration in Francesco Totti's eyes after he took on this responsibility.

??	The Roma player makes a move,

??	kicks, fantastic! It's in the net.

??	If there was a moment when I thought we'd go the whole way, it was...

??	Francesco Totti's penalty.

??	We knew the grid and knew we would play

??	Ukraine after Australia.

??	And considered them beatable.

??	We considered Australia beatable too but we very nearly got eliminated.

??	So when the penalty went in,

??	I thought,

??	"I think we might make it all the way."

??	De Rossi.

??	Daniele De Rossi also scored a penalty.

??	ITALY FRANCE

??	JULY , 

??	It was the final against France and he kicked the third penalty.

??	I remember it as though it had happened  minutes ago.

??	The flashes from the mobile phones in the stands, the roar at the penalty taken by

??	Trezeguet, who had failed to score.

??	Crossbar!

??	Trezeguet hit the crossbar!

??	Responsibility mixed in with nerves and a pinch of fear.

??	Then the penalty, and I don't remember a thing.

??	I remember feeling liberated, my legs felt light as I returned to midfield.

??	We still hadn't won but just a little bit...

??	I felt just a little bit calmer.

??	It's in!

??	Third goal, infallible so far!

??	The cool headedness of this player.

??	Let's see Daniele De Rossi's goal again, so cool headed...

??	But his time in the tournament was marked by another episode.

??	It's red!

??	ITALY USA

??	JUNE , 

??	Red card for De Rossi.

??	I don't know if I've said this.

??	The evening before the game, we had the usual video with the coach, with Ciso Pezzotti, Coach Lippi's main collaborator.

??	He showed us  seconds of a video saying,

??	"Watch this McBride, he leaps up with his elbows high.

??	He's tough, he elbows you out of the way, don't be unprepared."

??	And I was too prepared.

??	Look at McBride's forehead.

??	You can't forget these things. And winning the World Cup does miracles.

??	I was talking to Calafiori, a very young guy, and I said, "No, it was wonderful,

??	Riccardo. It was wonderful."

??	"How long?"

??	"Almost two months, then I got sent off..." "Sent off?"

??	The younger generation only remembers me winning the World Cup.

??	The fact that I got sent off is forgotten. No, I was mistaken.

??	Nearly all today's national team players were children in .

??	They watched the World Cup on TV and everyone remembers little bits.

??	The match I remember most was the game against Germany, especially the goal scored by Di Piero.

??	Gilardino did something amazing.

??	Gilardino.

??	ITALY GERMANY

??	JULY , 

??	Gilardino again, ball on the right, he turns, Alex Del Piero!

??	I remember that match more than the final.

??	I was at my aunt and uncle's home, we were wearing Italy shirts, with flags, and horns.

??	We made a din for the duration of the match.

??	We're real masters of that in Naples.

??	I remember we were all at my parents' home.

??	All dressed in Italy's colours.

??	We went out when Materazzi scored.

??	Pirlo's cross, Materazzi pulls away and scores a goal!

??	Knowing Italy was the best team was a unique feeling.

??	That national team had us all dreaming, it filled the Italians with enthusiasm, and that's what we want to do now, right?

??	To bring back passion and enthusiasm to the country.

??	The best memory, of course, was when we lifted the Cup...

??	And I think that for all the Italians and kids like me at the time, that was unforgettable.

??	Great!

??	Lore, this is for you.

??	Where?

??	Don't even go near the wall.

??	It's a challenge, I presume.

??	After dinner, we entertain ourselves for an hour, we have a chat around the table, then we all go back to our rooms.

??	Often people who have families, who have children, organize video calls, and go back to their rooms. It's how you see your family, it's changed.

??	There used to be a lot more noise in the corridors, because we were up late, and we'd go to other players' rooms at  a.m.

??	We'd go and play cards somewhere.

??	We still do, but not as much.

??	I have my favourite room, room  which I've had since time began.

??	Hi there.

??	-I left you as much room as possible.

??	-The striker's room.

??	Then you can sort it out.

??	When the others are here, we have a coffee, then a chat and we come to this room or the other one, usually this one.

??	Yes, it was a bit...

??	And lots on the balcony...

??	We talk between training sessions.

??	Every eve has its own story, its own anecdotes and unexpected events.

??	In Coverciano, they still remember a friendly match played by

??	Arrigo Sacchi's national team before they set off for the  World Cup in the USA.

??	The defeat against Pontedera.

??	ITALY BEATEN BY PONTEDERA

??	The coach had taken that into consideration, because we weren't there to win the match.

??	Or at least the victory was to be a consequence of that.

??	We were working on certain principles, and it's possible to lose against a Serie C team, as Pontedera was in those days.

??	The man of the day was Francesco

??	D'Arrigo, -year-old Pontedera coach and big Sacchi fan, capable of giving, with his Serie C team, a sound beating and lesson to the national team.

??	The skill of the team and the coach in particular lies in being able to transform something negative into positive.

??	That's football for you.

??	ITALY BRAZIL

??	JULY , 

??	You lose against Pontedera and reach the final.

??	For me the main thing was the game, and it was to help all the players to play better.

??	If you have players who play on their own, one times one always equals one.

??	But if they play with the team, for the team, all over the field, all the time, one times ten makes ten.

??	Sacchi is... was everyone's beacon.

??	In the evening we always discussed what Arrigo had done during the day. About his megaphone, the way he scolded players, and him allowing the players a day off after the match.

??	I think that was his strong point, the fact that he was really manic, right?

??	In his coaching, the way he always aimed to be a perfectionist from every angle.

??	After every World Cup match, the following day, those who had played less did their training, the others wound down and in the afternoon we wanted to rest.

??	But the phone would always go, and that always meant he was sending for you.

??	His training didn't end when the match ended on the pitch, it continued in the changing-rooms.

??	During retreats, he would come to our rooms at night.

??	Everyone tried to escape him because they knew that sooner or later there'd be another lesson.

??	From the  World Cup, we will never forget

??	Roberto Baggio's slalom between the opponents' legs.

??	Roberto Baggio leaps and scores!

??	Goal!

??	His feints, his decisive goals!

??	For Baggio... and it's a goal for Roberto Baggio!


??	Then came that cursed penalty in the final with Brazil that condemned us to second place.

??	But he left us a quote that is true both in football and in life.

??	The World Cup is over.

??	"Only those who have the courage to take a penalty miss them."

??	There was this Nobel Prize winning

??	French poet, called Rolland who said,

??	"A hero is a man who does what he can."

??	And this team really did do everything it could.

??	If the  World Cup was remembered for Roberto Baggio, the  World Cup is remembered for the wild expression and sporting determination of Totò Schillaci.

??	He got to play in the cup almost by chance.

??	Totò Schillaci scores!

??	Often in big tournaments, the man you least expect to stands out.

??	As did Fabio Grosso, who in , started out as a reserve.

??	Goal!

??	Goal by Fabio Grosso!

??	The extra man for the  Euro cup could be the man you least expect.

??	According to the history of Italian football, there's always someone who proves decisive in the end, so... we've got our eye on him but we're not telling anyone, especially not our opponents.

??	We have a team that leads us to ask,

??	"Who will score today?"

??	And we are hoping there are lots of them scoring goals.

??	So he raises his arm, you set off and he passes the ball to Marco.

??	Marco stops the ball, puts it in the goal or on the far post.

??	Offside is a rule that is difficult to interpret.

??	My wife's tried to explain it to me a thousand times.

??	If... I have the ball here and I do this, it's never offside.

??	Even if I do this.

??	Don't pass it. If I pass it behind?

??	Yes, it's not offside.

??	Think, the ball is only considered offside when...

??	You go before the ball.

??	That means...

??	He says if you go behind it...

??	That you take advantage and I throw the ball in...

??	No, if the ball goes behind, but once...

??	Sorry.

??	The ball...

??	No, I meant afterwards...

??	After, even more so.

??	Give me the ball.

??	If I play it inside, it's offside.

??	Pass me the ball.

??	-He passes to Insigne who returns it.

??	-That's right.

??	And Berardi passes it back.

??	No! Over there!

??	He has to pass it back?

??	Otherwise it's offside.

??	He has to send it back.

??	He has to send it back, tell him.

??	He doesn't know!

??	You've lost.

??	How long have they had this rule?

??	Always.

??	I think this is offside.

??	No, if you send the ball back...

??	If you pass it back, no, but if

??	Berardi passes it forward, it is.

??	What if I send it here?

??	If you...

??	Right... he passes it to you, right?

??	Then he passes it back, okay?

??	When he kicks it, if he's kicked it back...

??	Towards midfield, that is.

??	Then it's not offside.

??	If the ball is kicked back it's not offside but they weren't wrong before because the ball was kicked forward.

??	It's wrong, they're mistaken.

??	Manu, two minutes.

??	Okay.

??	One's enough.

??	Check if we're out of salads after you take these.

??	Then I'll make some more and they're ready.

??	I've already done the vegetables, they're blanched and lightly fried in the pan.

??	Giorgio.

??	I'm here.

??	Thanks.

??	There are three veterans on the Italian team who have already played in the European Cup twice, in  in Poland and Ukraine, and  in France.

??	These players are Sirigu,

??	Bonucci and Chiellini.

??	When you...

??	LEONARDO BONUCCI'S HOME ..started out with the right approach and right team, you always went one better.

??	As soon as...

??	You pick up the sensations straight away.

??	Whatever the result even at the World

??	Cup when the team didn't play...

??	That's right, but it's no coincidence.

??	But it was a sensation you got both in  and .

??	You could tell the team was good, very close, and they knew...

??	How to get ahead, and everything else that made the difference.

??	The atmosphere surrounding the European Cup is very special.

??	I was fortunate enough to play in  and , two different tournaments, but both very exciting for everyone.

??	The assist to Giaccherini in the game against Belgium in Euro  was... something we'd practiced over and over.

??	ITALY BELGIUM

??	JUNE , 

??	Bonucci passes to Giaccherini.

??	Giaccherini!

??	Yes!

??	Giaccherini! Giaccherini!

??	Those were situations our coach,

??	Conte, tried out every day.

??	He'd had two or three other chances, but Emanuele had got it wrong.

??	The coach had slammed Giaccherini for it, and I remember saying, "Giac, don't worry, we'll succeed when it really matters." And if you see us cheering after

??	Giac scored, I am the first one there and I say, "I told you so,

??	I told you so.

??	After trying over and over, we were able to get it right.

??	Seeing the people's enthusiasm,

??	Italy's enthusiasm from afar, it felt as though this enthusiasm had reached us, the cheering...

??	It was really exciting to arrive at the stadium and see all those flags, and lots of people who had travelled there to support us.

??	It was incredible.

??	We felt really good, we were a very well-matched team.

??	Perhaps the game against Spain... the match against Germany which we lost on penalties, but there were very important moments for this national team, we worked well together.

??	If there's an Italian team that, despite not winning, the Italians fell in love with, that was Conte's team in .

??	As Flavio Insinna said, "We're really tiny, but we will grow."

??	We might not have been the best

??	Italian team of all time, but we had a great leader and tough men on the field.

??	These men, these boys, were able to consolidate the team and carry out Conte's plans, making great sacrifices, working  days, and they almost reached the semi-finals by beating...

??	Beating Spain in the quarterfinals in Paris, and forcing Germany, the World

??	Champions, to a penalty shoot-out.

??	Germany is in the semi-finals of the European Cup.

??	A great Italian team beaten in a penalty shoot-out.

??	ITALY GERMANY

??	JULY , 

??	A great national team.

??	Lots of applause for these players who didn't deserve this result.

??	They deserved to go forward.

??	When we were eliminated from the cup that evening, everyone was in tears.

??	Tears, I believe, due to the fact that we had been eliminated at the penalty stage, and... at the same time, I think they were tears due to the fact that they knew the following day they'd be going their separate ways.

??	We took with us something wonderful.

??	It was a dramatic ending from both a sporting and human point of view, because I remember everyone in tears in the changing-room.

??	We came out for the usual press conference.

??	I went to the changing-rooms to get the players and several were hugging, in tears, from the oldest to the youngest because we had realised that the adventure was now over.

??	We had all believed in it and given it %.

??	Our debut against Turkey is around the corner.

??	In a few hours Mancini and his men will get on a bus heading for Rome to play their opening match in the European Cup.

??	It's time to concentrate on the pitch and their opponents.

??	LEONARDO BONUCCI'S HOME

??	Hey, Giorgione, shall I serve your coffee? You serve me some balls.

??	Okay.

??	The three matches in this round...

??	None of them are easy.

??	No, we can win all three or lose all three.

??	I've studied all the possible results... I'm not normal.

??	You're not normal.

??	In theory, if everything...

??	If we win the first two... we'll be playing Holland or Belgium in the quarterfinals.

??	Then the round with France,

??	Germany or Portugal ..and that can mix everything up.

??	Yes.

??	All the calculations... because that's a tough round.

??	Then there's England with Croatia, they'll be at each other's throats...

??	The others even more.

??	The big teams are always

??	Portugal, Spain...

??	Germany is always the best team.

??	France has very good players, important players.

??	De Bruyne is the best midfielder in the world.

??	Belgium, France.

??	Mbappé is a year younger than me but he's a first-rate footballer.

??	Mbappé is like an alien from out of space.

??	I reckon Mbappé is one step above everyone else.

??	But when we come down a step, we find a group of young and not so young players, and among them seven or eight Italian players.

??	Talking about the characteristics of the players,

??	I think we can start with the goalkeeper.

??	I think he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world.

??	Leo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini.

??	Let's say Leo is our playmaker in defence.

??	We can rely on Giorgio, he's a very skilful player.

??	Personality.

??	Florenzi has a lot of skills.

??	When he has the ball, he knows where to send it.

??	On the left... Emerson. He's the wing-back who attacks the most. ..our prerogative.

??	Emerson's cross, a header and it's for Italy.

??	Spinazzola is a very powerful, technical player, a devastating one when he's physically at his best.

??	For the midfielders, we can start with Jorginho.

??	He's one of our essential players, he rarely loses the ball and manages to involve all the players in the game.

??	I consider Verratti a champ.

??	Physically strong, perfect technique. ..in the penalty area... Verratti!


??	I believe Nicolò Barella is the prototype of a midfielder.

??	Lorenzo Pellegrini is very good at giving input...

??	He can play both in midfield or on the wing in attack. Locatelli is also a very young player, very technical, very dynamic.

??	Ciro Immobile is the centre forward and a great goal scorer.

??	He gets the team to play.

??	Federico Chiesa scores lots of goals, he's technically very good and fast.

??	Another important forward is Gallo

??	Belotti, an experienced player.

??	And another great goal scorer.

??	Domenico Berardi.

??	A player who could put his mark on the European Cup.

??	Lorenzo Insigne brings together the midfielders and the strikers.

??	So he is another very important player.

??	A fantastic goal! Great goal from our "Lorenzo the Magnificent".

??	I think we are our own worst enemies, because after these wonderful results we are having, if we think we've already achieved something, then we are mistaken.

??	I have a lot of faith in this team.

??	Today we have an extraordinary family in our "Club Italia", the family of Italian football.

??	Sport is something that unites people throughout the world, and that's why when the Italian team is playing, the streets are empty, because they're cheering us on.

??	Even those who don't know much about football are interested in the national team.

??	We have seen how Mancini's boys got this far, how they have absorbed his teachings, how they became a real team.

??	It is now up to them to put heart, talent and strength onto the pitch.

??	Let's hope they can entertain, enthral and make us shout with joy.

??	Our journey is at an end for now.

??	Another journey is about to begin.

??	And as someone once wrote,

??	"There are no limits but the sky".

??	COME ON, BOYS!
