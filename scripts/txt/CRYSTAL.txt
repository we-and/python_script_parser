(CRYSTAL INFERNO)


STEELE	I hope this isn’t going to be an,issue?

BEAUMONT	This isn’t Detroit. Its Europe. You need to take a more subtle approach dealing with our problems.

STEELE	You hired me because I have a track record of solving problems, sometimes my methods are not conventional but that’s also why you hired me. You have over fifty million Euros on the line in this project, my job is to make sure that happens.

BEAUMONT	I appreciate your dedication. I assume it was all satisfactory.

HOFF	Are you making a joke?

BEAUMONT	Not at all... What seems to be the problem?

HOFF	Bribery Mister Beaumont.

BEAUMONT	Bribery? I am insulted at the insinuation, who are you accusing?

HOFF	I intend to find out. Your associate here- Alluded to a substantial sum to ignore serious problems in your electrical installations- I am not sure how things operate in the United States but here we have integrity in our construction practices.

ERIC	I merely offered to compensate you for any penalties that we may have to facilitate your approval.

HOFF	You really think I’m that kind of person?

ERIC	Eveline please, I really want to work with you, not against you.

BEAUMONT	Madame, I apologize for Mister Steele’s poor communication skills.
 
HOFF	I understand him perfectly. Thus I want to be clear that I will be reporting your business practices to the authorities.

BEAUMONT	I don’t think we should be so hasty-

HOFF	Good day sirs.

ERIC	Ms. Hoff, let me take you downstairs.

HOFF	No, thank you. I know the way.

ERIC	Except that I have the elevator safety key.

BEAUMONT	She’s emailing-

STEELE	Cell phone jammer. I don't leave anything to chance Mister Beaumont.

ERIC	Sorry it didn’t work out.
 
BEAUMONT	Oh my God.

ERIC	Such a lovely day...

JAMES	Come on you can’t be bored with the city yet. So much to see and do... The Rubens House, the Van den Bergh Museum, St. Paul’s...
 
TOM	Are you kidding me? The kids can’t stand that stuff. Well, maybe Anne would.

JAMES	Yeah I hear ya. Can’t stand all that tourist nonsense either. Wish they’d just tear it all down and let us build it right. We’d make a killing. How about the Zoo?

TOM	Reminds me too much of my day to day existence.

JAMES	Hello Darkness! What’s going on with you and Brianna? Married bliss wearing thin? Honeymoon over?

TOM	The honeymoon was fifteen years ago, remember?

JAMES	Is it that long? Told you I’d be there for you, remember?

TOM	Easy brother, I’m not looking for an expensive divorce lawyer. We just need to sort ourselves out.

JAMES	Expensive?! Come on, I’ll give you a discount, you know that!
 
TOM	No it’s just... She’s on the road all the time, really focused on her work... Sometimes I feel like there’s no room for Ôus.’

JAMES	Sure she doesn’t have something on the side?

TOM	Look, that's not exactly what I need to hear right now.

JAMES	It’s the number one reason spouses go cold.

TOM	James, please shut up.

JAMES	All right, all right but do you even know what, or who she’s doing right now in Paris, city of lovers?
 
BRIANNA	In conclusion, the UBX Tower built by Beaumont and Associates is designed to be the most energy efficient as well as safest buildings on the market today.

BEAUMONT	Wonderful.

GRANGER	Well, thank you very much Brianna, that means a lot coming from a structural engineer of your caliber.

BRIANNA	You’re very welcome Hans. I now need to oversee the physical inspection of the tower to ensure the Ôdream’ is fully realized.

GRANGER	Sure. I look forward to continuing our partnership.
 
BEAUMONT	So you confirm that Brianna will continue on the project?

GRANGER	Of course! We already talked about that. Basic due diligence before any acquisition. I want to make sure everything is fine to the last detail.

BEAUMONT
Of course.

GRANGER	All right then, that does it for today. We’ll have a decision for you in the next quarter.

BEAUMONT	Fantastic. We’re still having dinner tonight?

GRANGER	Of course! We have a table reserved at eight pm in my favorite restaurant.

BEAUMONT	I would appreciate if miss Bronson joins us.

GRANGER	I’m afraid that won’t be possible. She-

BEAUMONT	Hans... In such an important matter we all have to feel confident. As mrs Bronson... Brianna... is now part of this Òcontinuing partnershipÓ, as you said...

GRANGER	Let me talk to her. I’m sorry, Brianna but I think you’ll have to stay in Paris one more night.

BRIANNA	But I’m supposed to catch the train back to Antwerp in an hour-

GRANGER	Please Brianna? Beaumont is known for being kind of touchy. I’d love things to go smooth between us all. Do you understand?

BRIANNA	Why yes... of course.

GRANGER	Thank you.

BRIANNA	ÔCall home’

PHONE 	ÔCalling... home’
 
BRIANNA	Hi honey, something’s come up. The client asked me to stay later so I’ll have to take the train back to town tomorrow morning... Call me.

BEAUMONT	As we expected, that Bronson woman will be a problem if she gets deeper into this.

STEELE	Yeah, looks like she’s not the kickback type.

BEAUMONT	I know. But I just want this handled with subtly, we are not a bunch of cowboys.

STEELE	Don’t worry and stick to the plan I made for you. She’s a wife and a mother, we’re going to make her uncomfortable and take her out of the game, make it about her family...

BEAUMONT	I need her to be gone before the next quarter.
 
STEELE	She’ll be. And you get Granger to sign. You can give it a go.

BEAUMONT	Ok. You have 3 hours to get everything ready.

BERT	Yes, sir. Brianna! Well, that’s a surprise... What are you doing here? You don’t live in Antwerp anymore?

BRIANNA	Well yes. But... How...

BERT	Brianna... Don’t tell me you don’t recognize me!

BRIANNA	I’m very sorry, I... don’t know.
 
BERT	Bertrand! New Year’s Eve. What... Two- three years ago? I’m so glad.

BRIANNA	Listen, errr, Bert...

BERT	Bertrand.

BRIANNA	Bertrand, I’m really sorry but... I have to go, I have a dinner that I am late for.

BERT	Ah? Ok. I get it.

BRIANNA	Again, I’m sorry.

BERT	Well, let’s get in touch in Antwerp, then?

BRIANNA	Sure, yes.
 
BRIANNA	I’m sorry I’m late-

HANS	Oh no, don’t be.

BEAUMONT	Being late is a woman’s privilege.

HANS	Here, we’ve saved you a seat.

BEAUMONT	Hans told me you’re an expert in rock climbing.

BRIANNA	Maybe not an expert, but I’ve always loved it for sure.

GRANGER	And you’ve been doing this for how long?

BRIANNA	Since I was a little girl. At the end of my studies, I even planned to work as a mountain rescuer.
 
BEAUMONT	If I may ask, what made you change your mind?

BRIANNA	I met Tom. My husband.

BEAUMONT	So you gave up your passion for him? No regrets?

BRIANNA	Definitely not. I changed the order of my priorities. I wanted to raise a family.

BEAUMONT	How do you handle this, then?

BRIANNA	You seem to have a strange view of a woman’s life. I can manage my passion, my family and my job with no problem.

GRANGER	Well, what about we order the wine?
 
BRIANNA	Tom... Could we have two minutes together? Tom, this is our last chance. Are you sure you want to go that way? Can’t we just put this horrible prank behind us?

TOM	Prank, I’m sorry... You know I have a serious problem buying into that. The point is I have lost all trust in you and our marriage.

BRIANNA	What more do I have to do to convince you? I swear to God I never had an affair. I quit working on the project in Paris and I am staying here as much as I can to convince you that our marriage is more important than my job..

TOM	You know I really wish I was the kind of guy that could just put things behind him. Forget it ever happened. The problem is I am not.
 
STEELE	I thought we got her off the project... what is she doing here?

BEAUMONT	A beautiful coincidence: her husband’s divorce lawyer is a partner at Lando and Associates down on sixty-eight.

STEELE	Really? So nothing to do with the building?

BEAUMONT	Nothing! Just another failed marriage. The pictures worked beautifully as promised. She could not go back to Paris anymore and had to resign. No need for blood, you see?

STEELE	Well, it cost us a little more than expected to buy the new inspector and the new engineer but it was worth it. We passed inspection, nothing can change that, closing is only a week away.

BEAUMONT	All right. Hell it’s hot in here. Any idea what is going on with the air conditioning?

STEELE	That's an interesting question coming from the person who installed a system for half the cost and sixty percent less capacity than recommended.
 
ANTON	Allo! Yes, immediately! Let’s go!

PAUL	I promise you a flower. Before the day is-
 
ADRIA	Thank you, goodbye. Nice to see you again Mr Bronson. Please follow me.

JAMES	So she says to me Òso how am I going to make the house paymentsÓ How about getting a job ladyÓ... Hi Tom. Brianna?

MICHELLE	Sir.

JAMES	How are you, Miss Minor? I’m glad to welcome you all to our new offices. What a beautiful tower, isn’t it, Mrs Bronson?

MICHELLE	Perhaps it’d be best if we got started?

TOM	Yes. Let’s get this over with.
 
JAMES	Sure. Absolutely. Please take a seat.

BRIANNA	How are the kids today?

TOM	Perfectly fine. They can’t wait to officially live at their father’s.

ANNE	I don't think daddy is going to be happy that we are looking at these pictures.

BEN	Are you going to tell him?

ANNE	No.

BEN	I feel that something’s wrong.

ANNE	I looked a zillion times already, I’m telling you. It really seems that mom had a boyfriend in Paris.

BEN	It’s weird. Each time they kiss, the shots are closer.

ANNE	Ok... So?

BEN	I don’t know... The shots don’t seem in a logical order...

ANNE	So you think this is fake?

BEN	Don’t know yet.

ANNE	I wish you’re right...

BEN	I got it! Look! You see the passers-by in this shot?

ANNE	Yeah, well... So?...

BEN	They should be somewhere up here. But it’s like they suddenly disappeared.

ANNE	Yeah, you’re right. This photo seems to have been taken at a different time.

BEN	Exactly! They don’t match. That why every time they kiss, these are mid- shots. To avoid the passers-by!
 
ANNE	And that’s why we never see mom’s face when she’s kissing the guy.

BEN	Two different persons. Mom and someone else dressed like her. What the hell? Why would anyone do that?

ANNE	We have to tell Dad.

BEN	Just tried. But he doesn’t answer his phone. And mom’s is turned off. Surely because  they’re at the lawyer’s office.

ANNE	I bet the address is in his e- mails...

BEN	Here it is... Lando and Associates. 60th floor of the UBX Tower!

ANNE	Call a cab!

BEN	They’ll be mad... No, even worse.

ANNE	BEN! BEN Damn. Ok. Still not answering?

BEN	Nope.

PAUL	Vertragen, waar ga je heen?

BEN	Sorry, do you speak English?

PAUL	Ah yes, sorry. Where are your parents?

BEN	They’re upstairs, at the lawyers.

PAUL	Which lawyers? Lando and Associates? 60th floor. Hold on... When you see the pretty receptionist -her name is Adria- give her this for me.

ANNE	Okay. I will.

BEN	Smooth.

PAUL	Right this way.

BEN	Bye.

PAUL	Good-bye.

TOM	This is the problem. Selfish, unavailable. She was focused on her career rather than the family. And then an affair-
 
BRIANNA	I DIDN’T HAVE AN AFFAIR!!!

TOM	Its the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room Brianna...

BRIANNA	I made a lot of sacrifices to prove that I loved you but you never believed me, you’re the one that’s throwing our mariage away!

MICHELLE MINOR	My client is right. The incriminated photos are no tangible evidence.

JAMES LEVIN	But you were unable to bring us the proof that those photos are fake. And that’s why we are here today...

ANTON	Nooo!
 
TOM	What’s that?

BRIANNA	The fire alarm.

JAMES	Is there anything else your client wants to add to her outburst?

MICHELLE	Not for now, thank you.

TOM	About the fire alarm, what do we do?

JAMES	I’ll look into it. Adria?

ADRIA	Yes sir?

JAMES	Be a good girl and find out what’s going on, would you?

ANTON	There’s been an explosion, the transformer... We need to evacuate the building...

BEAUMONT	There’s a problem in the 20th flor machine room, something overloaded.

STEELE	Why couldn’t it have held for one more week?

BEAUMOMT	I’m sure they’ll have it under control soon.

ANTON	Come on! Follow me! Aim for the base of the flames!

ANTON 	Watch out! Hey, I need some help, here!  Help !!!!

ANNE	We have to get out! What are we going to do? Ben?! What are we going to do?

BEN	Shut up! I don’t know!

ANNE	HELP! HELP! WE’RE STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR!!!! HELP! HELP!

BEN	HELP US! HELP US!
 
ANNE	No one can hear us.

ANTON	Hello! Is there someone there?!

BEN	YES! We’re here! Help us!

ANNE	We’re stuck in the elevator! Please help!

ANTON 	I HEAR YOU! Hold on! Sorry, have to close the doors... Or the smoke... will kill you... I... come back with some... help...

BEN	No!

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Get these people out of here! Secure a perimeter!
 
NATASHA VILA	Thank you Mark. The UBX tower one of the newest structures in Antwerp and one of the taller buildings in Europe is on fire. It appears that the fire is emanating from the 40th floor...

TOM	Oh my god!

JAMES	We need to get out of here before this becomes another Nine-Eleven.

BRIANNA	Nine eleven was commercial jets full of fuel. This is a very different situation, it’s not going to bring down the building.

MICHELLE	Do you see the size of those flames?

BRIANNA	There are fire suppression systems throughout the building, it’s safest if we stay here and wait for the fire to be put out.

JAMES	You’re pretty confident about these Ôfire suppression systems...

TOM	Its her business. I would heed her advice.
 
JAMES	Well, I'm more into Òget the hell out of a building when it’s on fireÓ.

MICHELLE	Alright, let’s all figure out the best way to get out of here.

JAMES	I’ll take the first one.

BRIANNA	The first what?

JAMES	Elevators, stairs, or stay. I’ll take elevators any time.

MICHELLE	You sure?

BRIANNA	That's a really a bad idea. You don’t know in which condition are the elevators.

TOM	I am afraid I have to agree with my wife on this.

JAMES	Nine-Eleven. The ones who got out first are the ones who lived. Who’s with me?

MICHELLE	You’re not coming?

TOM	No!
 
BRIANNA	If you do anything you should take the stairs. They’re actually designed to be a fire refuge.

MICHELLE	Walk down 60 floors, that will take an hour. I’d rather take my chances on the elevator.

BRIANNA	One last time, this is really a bad idea.

PAUL	Adria! Where are you?

ADRIA	I’m up top Paul! They’re all taking the elevator.

PAUL	What’s that? What did you say?
 
ADRIA	They’re taking the elevator Paul! Should I go down with them?

PAUL	The elevator? No! Stay away from those! Take the stairs!

ADRIA	Oh my God! Wait! Stop!

JAMES	Sorry Adria, we’re full- take the next one.

ADRIA	No! Don’t!

JAMES	Tough break.
 
BRIANNA	Phone?

TOM	Mine. It’s Ben. Hello? What? Where?

BRIANNA	What is it?

TOM	Hold on- Where? What floor?

BRIANNA	What’s going on?

TOM	Hold on Ben. They’re here.

BRIANNA	Here? What do you mean here???

TOM	Well they’re here and they’re stuck in an elevator.

BRIANNA	Oh my God. Which one?

TOM	I don’t know somewhere near the fire.

BRIANNA	Above or below?
 
TOM	I... DON’T... KNOW!

BRIANNA	Give me the phone! Ben? BEN? Which floor are you on? Can you see a number on the elevator?

BEN	We’re just below the twentieth Mom... A man opened the door below us and there was lots of smoke and fire. He started coughing because of the smoke and he left.

BRIANNA	Ben! Listen to me! That smoke is poison! Use your shirts, and put them over mouth and nose! I want you to breath through your shirts do you understand?

FIRE DEPART. MESSAGE	Please hold. Due to the large call volume we’ve been forced to put you on hold. If this is not an emergency, please call your local emergency services
 
TOM	God damn it.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	We have a dozen lawyers in an elevator sir!

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	A dozen lawyers in an elevator, sounds like some sort of joke.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	No joke sir! They’re coming down from the 68th floor.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	We need to get them out of there!

MICHELLE	They say we should stop the elevator and walk down!
 
JAMES	Yeah, whatever!

MICHELLE	What’s the maximum capacity on this anyway? Ten? Gotta be fifteen of us in here.

JAMES	Relax, everything’s fine, we’re going down.

MICHELLE	Smells like smoke. Didn’t she say the smoke might be lethal?

MICHELLE MINOR	Help!! HELP!! LET ME OUT!!!

JAMES	COVER YOUR MOUTH! EVERYONE!!
 


CAPTAIN FREDERICK	we have a major gas leak in the basement, we need to widen the perimeters of the safety zone. Get the dosimeter. Let’s find out what’s in the air.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Lieutenant Jeanne to Base Camp.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Go on, Lieutenant! How we doing with the elevator?
 


FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	I’m so sorry captain, we couldn’t override it. We had to get up there. But... It was too late.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	What do you mean?

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	They’re all dead.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Damn. Ok, I’m coming.

BEAUMONT	What the hell are we going to do Eric? Wait until they get control of the fire and then what?

STEELE	Sir, you need to get a grip. Or would you prefer to come down and give the press an interview about all the buildings safety features that didn't work?

BEAUMONT	So what’s the plan?
 
STEELE	I’m calling my chopper. We’re flying to the airport where we’ll have a jet ready to fly us to a country with no extradition laws.

BEAUMONT	Alright.

STEELE	I’m gonna need a pickup. Soon as possible. Crosswind? I don’t care about crosswind. I want you to get here NOW!! Hell yes. Ok. All right. They’ll be here in twenty, let’s clean up. We need to destroy any compromising document.

TOM	You two just stay put, relax, Mom and I are going to figure out the best way to get you guys out of there. It’s going to be okay.

BRIANNA	Listen to your Dad. Everything’s fine.
 



BEN	Okay...

TOM	Anne? You hear me?

ANNE	I hear you Daddy... The phone battery is low.

TOM	Really? Where is it at?

BEN	Sixteen percent.

TOM	All right. We’re going to save the power, so we’re going to hang up the phone for now, and call you when we’ve worked things out ok?

ANNE	No!

BEN	Don’t hang up Dad!

TOM	You trust me don’t you?

BEN	Yes?

TOM	Then trust me when I tell you, everything is fine. I’m going to go now.

BEN	Yes.

ANNE	Okay.
 
BRIANNA	I love you both more than anything in the world.

ANNE	I love you mommy.

BEN	Me too!

ANNE	It’s going to be all right, isn’t it?

BEN	Yes.

BRIANNA	I don’t know how you can do that.

TOM	What?

BRIANNA	Lie to them like you do.

TOM	Really? You seem pretty good at lying to me.
 
BRIANNA	Enough with that. We need to help our kids. Come on! Help me!

TOM	Oh God.

BRIANNA	Shh! Ben! BEN!

TOM	We take the stairs.

BRIANNA	Like I said earlier, the stairwells could be full of toxic smoke. They could be a deathtrap.

TOM	The only other way down is the elevator shaft: 60 floors straight down.

BRIANNA	They’re on the twentieth floor, we’re on the sixtieth. The stairs will take too much time.

TOM	We’d better get going then. It’s them. Hello?

BEN	Daddy! There’s a lot of smoke! It’s really hard to breathe!

PAUL	The fire started on the twentieth floor, in the maintenance area.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	It will have spread a good deal by now if the sprinklers aren’t working. Have you cut the power yet?
 
PAUL	Not yet.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	We’ll send someone to cut it. We don’t need any more accidents.

PAUL	What do we do for the elevators?...

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	We’ll have to bring them down immediately.

OFFICE WORKER 1	Smoke! You can’t go any lower.

ADRIA	Oh, no!

BEN	Daddy... Hurry! There’s a lot of smoke now.

TOM	Hold your shirts up in front of your faces! Breathe through your shirts!
 
BRIANNA	Ben! Anne! There is a hatch in the elevator. Behind the ceiling lights.

BEN	Ok.

BRIANNA	Do you think you can get to it?

BEN	It’s high.

BRIANNA	Ben listen to me. The smoke is poison. You have to get you and your sister out of the elevator as soon as possible do you hear me?$

BEN	Yes!

BRIANNA	You need to get out. Think.

BEN	WE CAN’T REACH IT!!

BRIANNA	Listen to me! Can Anne stand on your shoulder and get to it???

BEN	Yeah, I think so...

BRIANNA	Then she can open the hatch!!
 
BEN	Ok, we’ll try.

BRIANNA	You have to do it!

TOM	You hear what your Mom is saying Ben? Do you understand?

BEN	Yes but she’s heavy!

TOM	You can do it Ben. I know you can. You gotta help each other.

BEN	Anne, lets do it!

BEN 	Climb!

ANNE	No. You go first.

BEN	You go!

ANNE	I won’t be able to pull you up. You go. You trained with Mom.

BEN	Okay.

ANNE	He’s doing it. The battery Daddy.

TOM	Hang up! We’ll call you!
 
BRIANNA	Come on! This is the north side. We have to check the south elevators. BEN! BEN!!

BEN 	...Mom!... ...Mom!.... Is everything okay? Come on!

ANNE	Here! Be careful.

BEN	Hurry! Climb up!

ANNE	I can’t reach!

BEN	Come on!

ANNE	It’s hot!

BEN	Anne! You have to do it! Please Anne!

 


ANNE	I’m trying, Ben!

BEN	Come on Anne! Do it for Mom and Dad! Think Spiderman! Keep going! Keep going! You did it!

BRIANNA 	Heeeyyyyy....

BEN	Look... I think it’s Mom. HEYY!!!

ANNE	HI MOM!

BRIANNA	They got out. Good. Now we just need to go down and get them.
 
TOM	Hold on.

BEN	Hello... I can’t- It’s hard to hear you Dad!

ANNE	Tell him the elevator’s on fire!

BEN	The elevator’s on fire Dad! The elevator’s on fire!

BRIANNA	They have to stay away from the smoke! Tell them to find a vent. Stay near a vent!

TOM	Ok. Ben! Look for a vent!

BEN	What?

TOM	A vent Ben. An air duct. Where fresh air is coming in. Do you see anything like that?
 
BEN	I see one!

TOM	You have to avoid the smoke and get to the ventilation vent!

BEN	Dad it’s above me, I'm not sure how I can get there.

TOM	Ok, I understand. Ben, its going to alright... I’m going to hang up now, so we can save the battery but you have to think of a way to get to that vent.

BEN	Ok Dad.

TOM	Okay.

BEN	We have to climb to that vent!

ANNE	How?

BEN	The ladder.

ANNE	Okay! You go first!

 


CAPTAIN FREDERICK	We have to emergency ground the elevators. We can’t have anyone else getting trapped and suffocating in the smoke.

PAUL	I got it.

ANNE	Climb higher.

BEN	Ok.

ANNE	You can do it Ben!

BEN	1... 2... 3... Aaah! Your turn Anne!

ANNE	Ben!

BEN	Anne!

BRIANNA	They’re grounding the elevators!

TOM	So?

BRIANNA	I’m sorry.

TOM	What about?
 
BRIANNA	There’s no time Tom...

TOM	What are you doing?

BRIANNA	It’s the only way.

TOM	Brianna!

BRIANNA	Come find us! BEN! ANNE!

BEN	Mom! Mom!

BRIANNA	I’m coming Ben! Stay put!

BEN	Mom! IT’S ANNE!

BRIANNA	Just hold on Ben! I’m on my way.

BEN	Mom! Mom! No!

BRIANNA	Hold on Ben!

BEN	Mom! NO! DON’T FALL!

BRIANNA	Be quiet Ben! I need to focus!

 


BEN	Mom! Are you okay?

BRIANNA	Yes... Where’s your sister?

BEN	She’s gone.

BRIANNA	What do you mean?! Where is she Ben?

BEN	Mom...

BRIANNA	Where is Anne?! Oh my God what happened?! Did she fall? What happened?! Talk to me! Is she all right?

BEN	I... don’t... know. When the elevator went down... she was on the roof. It took her down... there. Do you think she’s okay?

BRIANNA	She’ll be fine, don’t worry.
 
ANNE	Hello!? Is anyone here?! Hello? Can someone help me? Eweh. Oh no.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Captain! Our first team will be getting to the point of origin in just a couple of minutes.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	All right. How’s the evacuation?

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	We think we have just about everyone out now.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Better make sure. Jeanne, How are we doing on the ground?

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Everyone is back a hundred meters but we haven’t been able to shut off the gas leak in the garage.
 
CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Just a matter of time before something sets it off. We’d better make sure no one’s been left behind underground.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Got it.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	All right, let’s keep it that way.

PAUL	No news from Adria? My girlfriend? She never made it out!

BRIANNA	We can’t stay here forever Ben, can you make it over here?

BEN	No way mom!

BRIANNA	Ben. The fire is spreading. The smoke... The smoke is getting too thick. Ben... Look at me Ben. Come on Ben. Look at me.

 


TOM	Oh God... oh God... Ok... Just run through it... just run through. Bad move...

LAURENZ	Oscar Oscar nine nine fiver approaching UBX tower. Fire causing stability issues with the landing platform, advise for immediate departure.

STEELE	He’s here.

BEAUMONT	Almost done. What’s to keep them from finding the inspectors body in the rubble?

STEELE	We do this right, we’ll be long gone. All we need to do is get to the airport, they’re prepping the jet. Besides if we’re lucky, they’ll miss the connection.

BEAUMONT	It’s just not fair, we were so close.

STEELE	We live to fight another day. Ok. Let’s go.

TOM	Oh no. No... no....

LAURENZ	Oscar Oscar nine nine fiver I need clearance for transit to Antwerp International.

STEELE	We need to go!

LAURENZ	I need clearance or we will never be allowed to land. Roger control, following five, niner seven to Antwerp International.
 
STEELE	What’s the problem lets go!

LAURENZ	We have a lot of heat from the building, it makes the air very choppy.

BEAUMONT	Damn it, land back on the building!

STEELE²	Shut up! We’ll be fine.

LAURENZ	The heat from the fire is affecting the lift. Mayday! Mayday! We are going down... Repeat, we are going down!! Brace for impact!!

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	TAKE COVER! NOOOO!!!!!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	I need oxygen!

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Where was he?

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	In the stairwell.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Easy there sir, we got you. We’re just going to catch our breath here for a minute then we’ll get you out of here. Whoa whoa calm down now- Calm down!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Hold him down! Just a second...

TOM	Stop! Stop! No! My wife and kids!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	What’s that?

TOM	They’re in the elevator shaft.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	In the shaft?

TOM	Yes. Yes we have to find them. Help me!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	No, you’re getting evacuated.

TOM	No! You don’t know where they are-
 
FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Which shaft?

TOM	Come on, I’ll show you.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	He’s not equipped. You don’t have any gear. You need to get out of here.

TOM	It’s my family!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	The best way to help them is to let us do our jobs.

TOM	You can’t stop me.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	We don’t have time for this.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	The fire’s moved into the walls. It’ll be unpredictable. Dangerous. We won’t be able to protect you, do you understand?

TOM	Yes! Come on! There’s no time! They should be around the 20th floor. In the south shaft.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	All right.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	We’ll take the stairs. Go! Whew...

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	That was really brave.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	And a little stupid. 20th floor you said?

TOM	Yeah.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	We’re here. Let’s go.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	It’s warm.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	That’s the point of origin, should have burnt out by now.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Which shaft did you say it was? South?
 


FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	No! Stay down! Stay down!

BRIANNA	You have to do it Ben. You have to.

BEN	I can’t Mom. I can’t do it.

BRIANNA	Okay Ben. I believe you. Do you remember our seaside holidays together? You were, what? Seven? Dad had rented this huge villa on the cliff. Everyday we had picinic on the beach. You and Anne loved it. There were those two big rocks popping up from the sand. Do you remember them? Well, they were not so big, actually. Bigger than you were, for sure. But for you, they were like two big mountains. They were three feet away from each other. You used to climb on the first one. I was on the other. And you waited for me to hold my hand out. Then you jumped! Anne was terrified each time you did it. And it made you laugh your head off!

BEN	I called her chicken.

BRIANNA	She was just scared for you.

BEN	Yeah, right.

BRIANNA	Ben... Ben!! You gotta reach the ladder! Try to grab the ladder!!

BEN	Mom!!!!!

BRIANNA	Ben... I’m begging you.

BEN	Dad!! Dad!!!

TOM	Ben! Hold on, both of you! Come on, Ben, come to us. That’s it, buddy. You’re almost done. Where’s your sister? Where’s Anne? Where is she? What happened to her?

BRIANNA	He said last he saw her she was holding onto the cable when they grounded the elevators.

NICK	That’s more than 20 storeys down.

TOM	Well, we have to go down there and get her.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	There is absolutely no going into the basement. We have a major gas leak. The entire place could blow at any moment.

BRIANNA	Lieutenant we have to find her. One way or another.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	We have a gas leak in a building on fire. Do you understand the math madame? We have to get you out of here now! We’ll send a separate party to go look for her as soon as we get the gas leak under control.

BRIANNA	Now you listen to me, I’m not leaving my daughter in the basement! I'm going down there!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	There is no way to get there. The entire basement has been sealed off.

BRIANNA	The elevator shafts.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	What?!

BRIANNA	My daughter is at the bottom of the elevator shaft. Waiting for Me. I’m going to get her and I need a climbing rope, gloves, and some oxygen.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Are you crazy, you can't climb down a fifty story shaft!...

TOM	She’s been climbing since she was a kid. She’s free climbed the Eiger twice.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Jeanne.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Yes?

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Give her what she wants.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Yes sir.

BRIANNA	Don’t be scared, I’ll find her okay?

BEN	I love you mom.  And I’m not scared anymore.

BRIANNA	And I love you too very much.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	The radio may not work down there, but the locating beacon will.
 
BRIANNA	Got it.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	We only have fifty meters of rope. It’s about three hundred feet down to the bottom.

BRIANNA	I wasn’t planning on tying off to the building.

BEN	All is my fault.

TOM	Of course not.

BEN	Yes! Everything happened because Anne and me came to see you.

TOM	Why did you come?
 
BEN	Because we found the proof that the photos of Mom with the guy are fake. We wanted to tell you.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Come on, we have to get you out of here.

NATASHA VILA	Someone is still alive from the wreckage of the downed chopper... I’ve just been told that it’s Lucas Beaumont himself, the man behind the tower! Mister Beaumont may have survived the helicopter crash. But I’m not sure he is going to survive the fire investigation into this building.
 
FIREMAN 1	Captain! We just found a woman’s body encased in concrete.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Encased in concrete?

FIREMAN 1	Affirmative, Captain. Between ground zero and the parking underground level. It’s the crater created by the A/C crash that trashed the concrete and released the dead body.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	What the hell...

FIREMAN 1	And there was this tag attached to her.

NATASHA VILA	Did you say Eveline Hoff? She was reported missing a year ago.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	How do you know?

NATASHA VILA	Come on, it’s my job! It was on the news. She was a building inspector on this tower and disappeared suddenly.
 
BRIANNA	Anne! ANNE! ANNE! ANNE! PLEASE! ANNE!! ANNE !!!!

TOM	We have to send a team down to find her!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	There’s no time. We need to get out of the blast area son.

TOM	What do you mean there’s no time?

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	The gas will probably ignite any second! There are too many remnant fires and electoral shorts. Come on! We have to get clear.

TOM	My wife and daughter are down there... You have to get them out!!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Listen to me, there is nothing I can do for your wife and daughter with out risking a lot of other peoples lives. They need to get out of there on there own.

TOM	Let me go!!!

BEN	Dad!!!
 


BRIANNA	What?... What?... Anne? ANNE? Anne! Breathe sweetie! Breathe! I’m here sweetie. Mommy’s here. You did so good baby. You did so good hiding here. You did so good. You were so brave here all alone... Now we have to get out, you and me. As fast as we can. You’re ready?

WARNING ANNOUNCER	This area is off limits. Stay clear of the blast area.

TOM	NOOO!

BEN	MOM!
 
TOM	I’m sorry... I’m so sorry...

BEN	Dad?... Dad?

TOM	What?

TOM 	Oh my God! Brianna! Anne!

BEN	Mom! Annie!

TOM	Oh we thought we lost you again. You know I never stopped loving you baby.

BRIANNA	I know.

TOM	I’m sorry for every stupid thing I thought.... And did. You were right. You’ve always been right. Could you ever forgive me?

PAUL	Adria!

ADRIA	Paul!

ANNE	Hold on. He wanted me to give this to you.

ADRIA	Oh my God!
 
TOM	Young love.

BRIANNA	Silly, they got nothing on us!

(THE END)
