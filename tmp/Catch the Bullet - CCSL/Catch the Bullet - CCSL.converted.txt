NATE	 What idiot fired that?
BRITT	 Nate.
NATE	 MacMasters.
BRITT	 I've been looking for you, Nate. Passed through Butte. Felt sure you'd be in the saloon.
NATE	 I kinda figured that.
BRITT	 I was gonna buy you a drink.
NATE	 I'm sorry I missed that.
BRITT	 That's why I brought it with me.
BRITT	 Top shelf.
BRITT	 What's the matter, Nate? Don't you like top shelf?
NATE	 Thought you were down near Medicine Bow.
BRITT	 Heard you were, too.
NATE	 I was, month back.
BRITT	 It's what I heard.
NATE	 How about we go down to the saloon, I'll buy you that drink?
BRITT	 Nate Mason. I'm arresting you on three counts of murder. Bank president and bank guard, in Casper, Deputy Bill Clark in Laramie. I'm also arresting you for the robbery of those banks.
NATE	 Damn, Marshal. I've done a hell of a lot more than that.
BRITT	 Those are the ones I've got paper on. Don't do it.
ALBERT	 Jessie, your long run is over. Now reach for the sky.
ALBERT	 Turn around slowly and don't make any sudden moves. Jessie James, I'm arresting you, all charges against you. Most recently, stagecoach at Hot Springs. But now it's over. You made the mistake of coming to Clearmont and crossin' paths with the great Britt MacMasters.
CHAD	 Criminy, Albert. I told you, use your name, not my pa's.
ALBERT	 But your pa is famous.
CHAD	 Not to me, he ain't. And I can't look at you sayin'-- with you saying you're him.
ALBERT	 What the hell does that mean?
CHAD	 It means what I'm saying!
ALBERT	 You never wanna be the Marshal and now it sounds like you don't wanna be the outlaw either.
CHAD	 It means what I'm saying.
ALBERT	 It is, Chad. If you wanna be the Marshal, then be the Marshal. I don't care.
CHAD	 I told you I don't wanna be Marshal MacMasters! Why in the hell would I wanna be him? And you'd be Marshal Hansen or somethin'.
DEX	 Hey, boys! Get in here, food's gettin' cold.
CHAD	 Yes, grandpa.
ALBERT	 Looks like you escaped to fight another day, Jessie.
DEX	 Come on, hurry up. You go any slower, you're gonna have to eat with the pigs! Well, so the only way we could get anywhere near that cabin was to climb Lookout Mountain. Don't forget now that's a 4000-foot fall. I blew in through that door and your daddy, he's got a rifle through the window and we got him dead to rights.
ALBERT	 Did they surrender?
DEX	 Well, when they found out it was the MacMaster brothers, they just gave up their ghosts!
CHAD	 Wait, wait. Pa told me when he kicked in the door, one of the gang shot him, so he busted three of them to Kingdom Come.
DEX	 Well, that may have been another cabin, we were hittin' a lot of cabins in those days.
ALBERT	 Be right back, the privy calls.
DEX	 His pa is over in Sheridan, trying to get a bank loan. He'll be back in a couple of days. And your pa, he's out there doing what he does for a living. If he had a choice, he'd be home here with you.
CHAD	 I ain't seen him in nearly three months, grandpa.
DEX	 Well, now that don't mean he don't like you. He loves you, boy. That's why he's out there.
CHAD	 Sure has a funny way of showing it.
DEX	 Yeah, you listen to what you just said. Show me a little gratitude.
CHAD	 Gratitude? For leaving me alone?
DEX	 He's out there providin'. He's--
ALBERT	 Six riders coming, over the ridge.
ALBERT	 Who are they?
DEX	 No good by the looks of 'em.
JED	 Hold up there!
JED	 Evenin'.
DEX	 Yep.
JED	 Me and my boys been ridin' all day. We are mighty thirsty.
DEX	 You got a lot of water right in front of ya!
JED	 It's a bit dirty. You mind putting that rifle down, mister. Them things is dangerous, don't you know? We don't want no dead geezer on the front porch, do we?
DEX	 What you looking for?
JED	 I'm looking for someone.
DEX	 Who's askin'?
JED	 An old friend. Ain't this the ranch of Marshal Britt MacMasters? And I'd like to see him.
DEX	 Well, he's not us, he ain't here.
JED	 You wouldn't mind if me and my friends here had a look inside, would you?
DEX	 You're not coming in this house.
JED	 Jack.
CHAD	 Grandpa! Grandpa, wake up!
CASS	 Huh! Hiya, up there.
DEX	 I'm alright.
CASS	 Hiya!
JED	 MacMasters!
CHAD	 Grandpa!
JED	 Marshal MacMasters! Search the house! Silas, middle. Willie. Blade.
CHAD	 My pa ain't here. And if he was, you'd be dead by now!
JED	 MacMasters is your daddy, boy?
JED	 Ain't that a kick o' the mule!
SILAS	 He ain't here.
BLADE	 Ain't that the luck.
JED	 We'll make MacMasters come to us. Where's your pa, boy?
CHAD	 I don't know.
JED	 How long he been gone?
CHAD	 Too long. Albert, run!
JED	 Albert! You stay put. You a MacMasters, too?
ALBERT	 No, sir.
JED	 Good.
JED	 He's dying, kid. You're coming with us.
BRITT	 York.
YORK	 Marshal. I heard you coming a mile away. And smelled you coming 2 miles away.
BRITT	 Nate Mason and the Giles brothers.
YORK	 Hey, judge ordered 'em alive.
BRITT	 Well, Nate didn't know that.
YORK	 I have something for you.
YORK	 Here you go, Marshal, you deserve it. You get 'em all at once?
BRITT	 Yep. I need you to bury 'em for me.
YORK	 I can do that for a price, everything for a price. I'll take their guns... ...and the horses.
BRITT	 Don't matter to me. Wire the Sheriff. He'll get word to the judge.
YORK	 Marshal, that hangman's kid's gonna starve if you don't get out of this business.
SILAS	 Hey Jed, we been ridin' for a while.
JED	 Come on! We'll make it to the hills before dark.
CASS	 We have the direction of where we're going from here, Jed.
JED	 Heading south, into Sioux territory.
CASS	 South, I like that, Mexico.
SILAS	 Them hills are close enough, holdin' up here 10 minutes won't hurt.
JED	 Get back.
JED	 Thought you'd be tougher.
CHAD	 I never walked this far before.
JED	 You wouldn't be walking at all if your pa had been back home looking after you. Instead, he left you with some old coot to get kidnapped. Things went as they was planned, your pa would be dead, you'd be an orphan.
CASS	 Let's hurry up with that plan.
JED	 Get up.
WILLIE	 Catch up with Blade over yonder.
SHERIFF	 Britt.
BRITT	 What's goin' on?
SHERIFF	 It's your pa.
BRITT	 Pa.
DEX	 Hey, Britt.
BRITT	 You don't look too good, pa.
DEX	 Oh. Nothin' a little whiskey don't fix.
BRITT	 What happened?
DEX	 Oh, uh... There were five or six of 'em and I-- I tried to...
DEX	 I-- I just passed out.
BRITT	 Chad. Chad!
BRITT	 Chad?
SHERIFF	 It's not Chad, Britt. It's Albert Hansen, Jack's boy.
BRITT	 Where's Chad?
SHERIFF	 We don't know. I rode out here this mornin', 'cause Dex was supposed to pick up an order from the mercantile yesterday.
SHERIFF	 But he never showed up. Starr asked me to check up on him, found him unconscious along the Signal Road.
DEX	 I tried to saddle up and I just tried to get in town. Um, uh.
BRITT	 How long ago did it happen?
DEX	 Three days ago.
SHERIFF	 We looked everywhere for Chad. I got a whole search party out looking from him now. We'll find him.
BRITT	 If he escaped from whatever happened here, he would've come back by now.
SHERIFF	 I telegraphed to Sheridan to see if they had any activity.
BRITT	 Jed Blake.
SHERIFF	 Yeah. Robbed a stage on the Laramie trail, and the bank in Casper. You know him?
BRITT	 I put him away five years ago.
SHERIFF	 Yep.
BRITT	 He's got five more ahead of him. Escaped last month with his man. Cass Gibbs.
DEX	 Cass Gibson, that son of a bitch.
BRITT	 Robbed a bank in Arvada, Wednesday.
SHERIFF	 That's the same day Chad was taken. Must've joined up with the rest of his boys.
BRITT	 Looks like Jed's my pigeon. Pa, listen to me, I'm gonna go find Chad, okay?
DEX	 Yeah.
BRITT	 Alright, you take care of yourself, I'll be back.
SHERIFF	 Nothin' on him says who he is or where he's from.
BRITT	 Looks like there were a lot of 'em. I think someone came here looking for me.
SHERIFF	 Why shoot Dex and kill Albert?
BRITT	 'Cause I wasn't here.
SHERIFF	 I have to bury that boy's body before it starts turnin'.
BRITT	 I'd appreciate if you'd notify Albert's daddy.
SHERIFF	 Yeah, I will. When are you headed out?
BRITT	 They got a hefty head start, better get goin' right away.
SHERIFF	 Yep, I'll get a posse together.
BRITT	 No. Too much time. And they'll just get in the way.
SHERIFF	 Sure about that? Gonna take on Jed Blake's gang alone?
BRITT	 I did it before.
SHERIFF	 I'll come with you.
BRITT	 I need you to stay here. Watch out for my pa, in case they circle back.
SHERIFF	 Then take Clay with you.
BRITT	 No time for greenhorns.
SHERIFF	 He's green, but he can shoot. I taught him. And Britt... ...Starr sent these along for your boy when you find him.
SHERIFF	 It's his favorite penny candy from the mercantile.
BRITT	 What's his favorite?
SHERIFF	 Whole town knows. Heads out to that mercantile, wooh! â€œLook out, peppermint sticks!â€ Good luck!
SILAS	 Ain't we got enough to deal with? The Marshal on our ass.
BLADE	 Why, you gettin' jittery, Silas?
SILAS	 You see them mountains over there, crawlin' with Sioux.
BLADE	 Them mountains are more than 50 miles away and ridin' past 'em.
JED	 Once we kill the Marshal, we can go to Mexico.
WILLIE	 You hate Mexico.
JED	 Damn right, I do.
WILLIE	 Why don't we just head straight South? It'd be faster.
JED	 Where is your sense of adventure, Willie? We's easy targets out here, blind man can track us.
SILAS	 Jed, you better let that kid ride tomorrow. If Indians come down on us, we're gonna have to ride fast.
JED	 Well, if he can't keep up, drag him.
SILAS	 He's a kid, Jed. Damn, even I got a little compassion.
JED	 That's why you're following, Silas. Not leading. I'll be back. Hey. You know I'm always watchin' you, right? Good.
SILAS	 What's gotten into him?
BLADE	 He's always been a mean prick, but not like this. Them five years in prison were hard on him. And all he thinks about is going after MacMasters.
SILAS	 He ain't no prairie rose, but he damn sure has changed.
BLADE	 Damn right. Watch yourself.
WILLIE	 Hey. Here, eat this. Leave before sunrise. Ain't makin' breakfast.
CHAD	 I ain't hungry.
WILLIE	 Yeah, but you know will be tomorrow and you know it.
CHAD	 Why? Why did he have to kill Albert? He didn't even have a gun.
WILLIE	 Kill all witnesses, I suppose.
CHAD	 He was-- he was just standing there and he shot him.
WILLIE	 Yeah.
CHAD	 He wasn't shot dead, he shot him some more.
WILLIE	 You need to quit thinkin' about it, kid.
CHAD	 He's gonna kill me, too. Ain't he?
WILLIE	 Nah, he wants your pa.
CHAD	 My pa most likely don't even know you took me.
WILLIE	 Once he finds out, ain't nothin' on his mind but coming for you.
CHAD	 In a month or two. Sometimes, he's gone as long as three. I bet... I bet you got Sheriff Wilkins and a posse from Clearmont tracking you down.
WILLIE	 Jed wouldn't like that.
CHAD	 Makes two of us.
JED	 Get up, Willie. Stop talking to that boy.
WILLIE	 Take care, kid.
WILLIE	 Hey, Jed. Talkin' to that MacMasters' kid.
JED	 Yeah?
WILLIE	 He says the sheriff from that town is gettin' up a posse and comin' after us, not the Marshal. Not MacMaster.
JED	 No. It will be MacMasters.
WILLIE	 I was just sayin' Marshal could be another month or so before he gets back to the ranch.
JED	 What if he got back the same day we took the kid, Willie?
BLADE	 He could be here tonight.
WILLIE	 We ain't got a lookout.
JED	 That's right, we don't. That's why I just elected you, Willie. Cass'll spell you in two hours. Blade, saddle up.
BLADE	 What?
JED	 Saddle up. Want you to backtrack. I'll find a spot from here to them hills, look out. Once you find MacMasters and his posse, get your ass back here.
BLADE	 Right. I know what to do.
JED	 And Blade. You leave MacMasters alone. You hear me?
BLADE	 I heard you.
SILAS	 Better get some sleep.
BRITT	 Hey kid, wake up!
TUCKER	 I'm awake! Marshal, we've been ridin' all night, can't we camp?
BRITT	 Last thing I need is for you to fall off your horse and slow us down.
TUCKER	 I said, I'm awake!
BRITT	 Half asleep ain't full awake.
TUCKER	 You're a real mean son of a-- Damn! Damn, Marshal! What'd you do that for?
BRITT	 Peace of mind. Now I know you'll stay awake.
TUCKER	 Son of a bitch! I got a loose tooth, dammit!
BRITT	 You can tell they're running fast. Prints are deep.
TUCKER	 Yep, I see.
BRITT	 If they hit up the bank, then this way makes sense. Avoid a posse from the Laramie trail.
TUCKER	 Yeah, it's just what I was thinkin'.
BRITT	 You done much tracking, Tucker?
TUCKER	 Ain't much of it called for in town.
BRITT	 Suspected as much. These tracks are from a war party.
TUCKER	 What?
BRITT	 Hooves are unshod. Jed Blake's gang turned south a mile back.
TUCKER	 Why don't we follow 'em?
BRITT	 Need to pick up my guide.
TUCKER	 A guide? What for?
BRITT	 If the trail goes cold.
TUCKER	 Hell, if a trail go cold, no one can follow it.
BRITT	 Chaska can.
TUCKER	 Chaska? An Injun?
BRITT	 Half Injun, half white.
TUCKER	 How can we trust him?
BRITT	 He's a good man.
TUCKER	 I didn't figure you for much of an Injun-lover, Marshal MacMasters.
BRITT	 Well, I might even learn to like you one day. I'm full of surprises.
TUCKER	 MacMasters, I'm not ridin' with no half-breed!
BRITT	 Then turn your horse and head for home.
BRITT	 I need Chaska on this hunt a hell of a lot more than I need you.
JED	 Come here, boy. Give me that hat.
CHAD	 Hey, give it back. It's hot as blazes out here, give me my hat!
JED	 Let the sun burn in your scalp, boy. Could take the fight out of ya.
BRITT	 Tucker, check on her.
TUCKER	 Is that the blacksmith?
BRITT	 Damn. Yeah, it's Harry Dyer.
TUCKER	 This his wife, too?
BRITT	 Yeah, that's his wife.
TUCKER	 Where you goin'?
BRITT	 To get a ride. That war party might pick up Jed's trail by cutting east.
TUCKER	 Aren't we gonna bury 'em? It'll take 15 minutes.
BRITT	 You got a shovel?
TUCKER	 No.
BRITT	 Neither do I. So it'll take more than 15 minutes. We ain't got the time. Let's go. Hiya!
SILAS	 Hey, Willie.
WILLIE	 What?
SILAS	 We robbed a stage and bank days ago. And we ain't divide the loot up yet.
WILLIE	 True.
SILAS	 We always divide it up as soon as we can.
WILLIE	 Jed'll do it.
SILAS	 Willie, when? I don't wanna die broke.
WILLIE	 Who said you gonna die?
SILAS	 We're out here ridin' in the open in Indian territory with a Marshal behind us, takes us dead, not alive! We're sittin' ducks.
WILLIE	 What's your point?
SILAS	 We're gonna die. Sooner than later.
WILLIE	 You don't need that money, do you?
JED	 Willie! Silas! Don't be makin' any plans now! Come on, boy!
BRITT	 Hello. Chaska? Hello? Chaska?
TUCKER	 He's not here.
CHASKA	 Hold it right there. State your business.
BRITT	 Chaska. If you've lost your eyesight, you ain't worth a plug-nickel to me.
CHASKA	 Britt MacMasters.
BRITT	 Hello, brother.
CHASKA	 Hell no, I haven't lost my eyesight. You should come ridin' in with the sun at your back like you always do. You know it. What brings you in?
BRITT	 Got a tracking job for you.
CHASKA	 I'm listenin'.
BRITT	 Could be Jed Blake and his gang.
CHASKA	 You don't need me to get those pissants.
BRITT	 I do, if they go above the tree line.
CHASKA	 Mountains?
BRITT	 Uh, I said, "if". Tracks head south, maybe Mexico, but I can't take a chance, I-- I need you.
CHASKA	 You know the deal, $10 for the week. Anything more, I get $1 a day extra.
BRITT	 Fair enough.
TUCKER	 $10?
CHASKA	 That's right, kid. You see those hills over there? That's Sioux territory. And whether we go desert or high country, my scalp is worth at least $10. What'd they do, Britt?
BRITT	 Shot Dex, killed a boy, and kidnapped my son.
CHASKA	 I'll find them. You kill them, you owe me nothin'. Who's the greenhorn?
BRITT	 He's Clay Tucker, deputy out of Clearmont.
TUCKER	 You know, he don't talk much like an Injun.
BRITT	 Father was Ki wa-go, great warrior. His mom was Kate Ryan, missionary. Gave him a good schoolin'.
CHASKA	 Where we headed, Britt?
BRITT	 Follow me.
BRITT	 What do you got?
CHASKA	 I see hills ahead, lots of rocks for cover.
BRITT	 How far?
CHASKA	 Half a day.
TUCKER	 It's a good place for an ambush.
BRITT	 Circle far around. They left anyone there, you come in behind him. We'll ride in the front door.
CHASKA	 Got it.
BLADE	 Woah. Yeah, that's right, keep comin'. Another half a mile and I got you dead to rights.
CHASKA	 Only on one of your good days.
BRITT	 Let's go. Hiya! Hiya!
BLADE	 I'm bleedin' out. Give me something to stop this bleeding.
CHASKA	 You give me some answers now.
BLADE	 I was just restin', I'm heading to Oregon.
CHASKA	 You're lyin'.
BLADE	 I'm not, it's the truth.
CHASKA	 "I got you dead to rights." Hardly the words of a guy restin'. Now get that arm up. Real nice and easy, give me your iron. Slow.
CHASKA	 Who are you?
BLADE	 I'm just a lookout.
CHASKA	 A lookout for who?
BLADE	 Indians, we're in Sioux territory.
BRITT	 That sounds like a lot of trail dust to me.
BRITT	 How about sneakin' some truth into those words of yours?
BRITT	 Ain't got a lot of patience, mister.
BRITT	 Now, how about you sing me a nice little song about everything you know?
BLADE	 I don't think so. Marshal, I don't sing.
BRITT	 Really? Where's Jed Blake?
BLADE	 He cut dirt yesterday. Headin' southwest.
BRITT	 My son?
BLADE	 He's fine last time I seen him.
BRITT	 How many ridin' with him?
BLADE	 Four. Maybe five.
BRITT	 Why southwest? Mexico's south.
BLADE	 I don't know.
CHASKA	 Sioux territory.
BRITT	 Now why the hell would he do that?
BLADE	 Jed's gone loco. Crazy. All he talks about is huntin' you down.
BRITT	 What do they call you?
BLADE	 Blade.
BRITT	 Bound to be paper on a mean-lookin' nibbler like you. Tucker, toss down some rope. Chaska, tie his hands and drag his ass up the hill.
CHASKA	 Get up.
BRITT	 You didn't search him?
CHASKA	 No. I didn't think you'd want to drag him along.
BRITT	 You were right.
TUCKER	 Your back was toward him. How'd you know he was gonna draw?
BRITT	 The little glint in his eye said he knew better than me.
CHASKA	 Lots of hoof print, shod.
BRITT	 These are our boys.
CHASKA	 Yep, day ahead.
TUCKER	 You know this place?
BRITT	 Crosses into Sioux territory.
TUCKER	 I thought he was headed for Mexico.
BRITT	 Guess he fooled us.
TUCKER	 What about the Injuns?
BRITT	 Jed likes to play rough. Sioux on one side, us on the other.
TUCKER	 That's comfortin', considerin' we still got warriors behind us.
BRITT	 Let's get through this as fast as we can, we'll find a place to fight on the other side.
TUCKER	 How long is it gonna take to cross?
CHASKA	 Four hours.
BRITT	 Hiya!
CHASKA	 I'll ride ahead...
BRITT	 Okay, we'll see you tonight.
CASS	 It is awful dry.
SILAS	 There ain't no water anywhere.
JED	 We'll get water just beyond them buttes.
SILAS	 Hey Jed, I gotta ask you. Why did we come this way?
JED	 Cat and mouse, Silas. Little bit of torture first.
CASS	 What's the difference between killin' him now or killin' him later?
WILLIE	 You need to be nice to that kid, you need him alive.
JED	 You're right. I want MacMasters to hate me as much as he can.
WILLIE	 You need his pa.
JED	 I do need his pa. To kill him.
CHAD	 Hiya!
CHAD	 Hiya!
WILLIE	 Go get him!
TUCKER	 Injun smoke signals, and you wanna have a campfire?
BRITT	 Gets cold at night.
TUCKER	 You really trust that Injun friend on yours?
BRITT	 With my life.
TUCKER	 I couldn't, I just couldn't.
BRITT	 You ever hear of the Massacre Canyon battle?
TUCKER	 Didn't pay any mind to it. Just a bunch of Injuns that killed each other.
BRITT	 Pawnee were on their summer buffalo hunt. Sioux war party of 1,500 attacked them. Killed over 150. Most were women and children, including Chaska's wife and son. You can bet the bank he hates 'em a hell of a lot more than you ever will.
JED	 Anything?
CASS	 Yeah, I saw fire over there.
JED	 MacMasters?
CASS	 No, Injuns. Heard a war yelp or two.
JED	 They could pick up our trail.
JED	 We need to get outta here, Cass.
CASS	 You can't get outta here any too soon for me.
JED	 What y'all gawking at? Hey! Look at me. Why do you look guilty?
SILAS	 Got a little explainin' to do.
JED	 Dammit! No! Dammit, boys! You had one job, one job!
CASS	 Jed, if you shoot that pistol, the Indians are gonna be all over us.
JED	 Who let him go, huh? Was it you, Silas? Huh?
SILAS	 It wasn't me.
JED	 How about you, Willie?
WILLIE	 Hey, Jed, Jed.
JED	 You liked that boy, huh? You liked that boy.
CASS	 Jed, I searched him, and he didn't have a knife.
JED	 Oh, he didn't have a knife. Then what the hell is that, Cass?
CASS	 Whatever. He can't be too far.
JED	 Dammit, boys! Get on your horses, let's go find him. And if you don't, I'm killin' every one of you.
SILAS	 Told you he was gonna be pissed.
JED	 Hiya! Let's go! Let's go!
JED	 I'm gonna find you, boy! I'm gonna find you. And when I do... ...I'm gonna shoot your pa and then you!
JED	 Where are you, boy? I'm gonna find you! I'm gonna get you! Where are you, boy? I'm gonna find you! I'm gonna find you, MacMasters! I'm gonna kill you and your pa! You can't run from me! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you!
JED	 You yell out for help, and them Indians will have our scalp before you can close your mouth.
JED	 Get up, get up.
JED	 Get up, go! Go! Come on, go! Go! Get up!
BRITT	 Smoke signals.
CHASKA	 Should I ride ahead?
TUCKER	 Why, so you can join 'em?
CHASKA	 And why would I do that?
TUCKER	 You're one of 'em, aren't you?
CHASKA	 I'm not Sioux, I'm Pawnee.
TUCKER	 You're all the same.
CHASKA	 And you're white, so is MacMasters. He's of sound judgement and smart, you're a fool. Same race, both different.
TUCKER	 Now you listen to me!
CHASKA	 I could kill you off that horse right now if I wanted to. You'd be dead before you hit the ground.
BRITT	 You'd have to hit him in the heart or between the eyes to do that.
CHASKA	 I could do it.
BRITT	 You're that fast?
CHASKA	 Hell yeah.
BRITT	 Well, prove it.
TUCKER	 Hey! No. What the hell!
JED	 Walk, boy. Get up there, boy.
CHAD	 I don't think I can.
JED	 I sure as hell can't carry ya.
JED	 Get up, boy! And stop acting like a girl!
JED	 Is Marshal MacMasters really your daddy? He know he raisin' a son that cries like a little girl?
CHAD	 And you cried a little girl when you got your eye poked out!
JED	 I'm gonna shoot your eye right now, boy. Get up that mountain.
JED	 Come on, Chad! I got the son of Marshal MacMasters and he can't climb a damn hill! My damn son.
JED	 Stop! Stop, kid! Stop! Don't run away from me! Yeah.
JED	 Keep walking, boy. Woah, boy.
WILLIE	 Jed, Jed. You fire that gun, you're gonna have Sioux from all around these hills comin' down on us.
JED	 I don't give a damn.
WILLIE	 Hey look, Jed, you've been beatin' on him enough. You need him alive.
JED	 You better not die, boy. I wanna see you suffer some more, you little MacMasters brat. Why? I ain't even begin to dig my claws in you yet, little fella. You're the only MacMasters I got just now. We're gonna play game some more. Then I'm gonna crush the breath out of your throat.
JED	 Willie. This your apple peeler, Willie?
WILLIE	 Yeah.
JED	 You lost it.
WILLIE	 You found it.
JED	 Ain't that a damn shame.
WILLIE	 God, Jed, what'd you do that for?
JED	 Make sure you don't lose it again. Lucky, I don't slit your throat. Come on, kid.
JED	 Now you boys keep a look out for Cass.
WILLIE	 Cass ain't coming back, he left last night.
SILAS	 He must be the smartest one of us all.
JED	 Stop here, boy. We're gonna stop for water.
CHAD	 Can I have some water?
JED	 Easy now, back up. Back up! Back up!
JED	 Don't drown yourself. You know, you tough as nails, boy. Remind me of myself when I was your age. You a good shot?
CHAD	 My pa says I am. But he said, "Don't aim at anything you're not willin' to destroy."
JED	 That's a good rule.
CHAD	 He's done a heapin' of destroyin' over the years.
JED	 How?
CHAD	 You'll soon find that out.
JED	 Give me that. Let's go, boys!
SILAS	 Willie, what the hell are you doin'?
WILLIE	 Tryin' to get drink.
SILAS	 This is Indian country.
JED	 Get on your horse, Willie.
WILLIE	 Gonna be a minute. Ah!
JED	 Fuckin' Indians!
SILAS	 Willie! Willie!
JED	 To the rocks!
SILAS	 Willie! Willie!
JED	 Cover that boy! Silas, I'm-- I'm gonna get the boy.
SILAS	 Willie.
JED	 Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Let's go!
SILAS	 He's dead.
JED	 Dammit! Get on your horse, Silas! Let's go, boy. Come on, boy.
BRITT	 Tucker, find us some cover.
TUCKER	 Camp, already?
BRITT	 About to have company. Injuns just behind us.
BRITT	 Put your gun down, Tucker. If I were a Sioux warrior, you'd already be dead.
TUCKER	 If I can't hear them, how will you and Chaska?
BRITT	 That's a very good question.
TUCKER	 Well, how about giving me a very good answer?
BRITT	 When I think of one, I'll let you know. Until then, just sit there and look invitin'.
TUCKER	 Like a worm on a hook.
BRITT	 You sure this is the way they'll come?
CHASKA	 Unless they circle wide and come in behind us. I know we haven't spoke of it, but we should. You do understand that...
BRITT	 Chad might be dead.
CHASKA	 Yeah.
BRITT	 He doesn't know why we moved to Clearmont, I never told him.
CHASKA	 You have to one day.
BRITT	 I plan on it. When he's older, he'll understand better, but not now.
CHASKA	 Chad is left at home without his mother. He sees her rocking chair, her stove. Constant reminders. You stay away, so you don't have to face those reminders. It's easier for you when you're away.
BRITT	 Easy?
CHASKA	 Chad is 12. And he's left alone with sad memories. I've known you long enough, Britt, it's why I'm speaking.
TUCKER	 What the hell! Why'd you take so long to shoot?
BRITT	 Shoot as fast as I could.
TUCKER	 Damn.
TUCKER	 The one that came flyin' through the air, if you didn't shoot him, I'd be dead.
BRITT	 I didn't shoot him.
CHASKA	 They've all gone or we killed all they sent.
TUCKER	 You shot the one that jumped towards me?
CHASKA	 Pretty good shootin' for a half-breed, wouldn't you say?
BRITT	 Let's get outta here. Hey, hiya!
SILAS	 That's an ambush.
JED	 Must be Marshal and the Injuns. Go find out who won.
SILAS	 What?
JED	 You heard me.
SILAS	 It's less than a mile away. Whoever it is, be coming down this path real soon.
JED	 Get your ass back here and tell me who.
SILAS	 Yeah, I wouldn't mind taking a crack at MacMasters myself.
JED	 You don't touch MacMasters, you understand me? If he's alive, see to it he stays that way.
SILAS	 Yeah, Jed.
JED	 Get outta here. Posse don't stand a chance against me up here. Mow 'em down. Where the hell is that posse? Where the hell are you?
SHERIFF	 Maybe they're not in there. They know we're followin' them. I think they kept ridin'.
BRITT	 I doubt it. Check it out.
SHERIFF	 Take the horses around back and cover us.
BRITT	 Ed! Ed Ryan!
ED	 That you, Marshal?
BRITT	 Ed, you come on out peaceful-like.
ED	 That's the funniest thing I've heard all week.
SHERIFF	 Ed, you stay in there, things are gonna get a whole lot worse for you.
ED	 I'm fine. I got three hostages. Make that two hostages. Let us ride and they live.
BRITT	 No deal, Ed.
ED	 One of 'em has a nice little locket. It's got a picture inside. It looks like you!
SHERIFF	 What the hell is he talking about?
BRITT	 Laurel came out here this afternoon to visit.
SHERIFF	 Goddammit.
BRITT	 Ed?
ED	 Yeah?
BRITT	 You let them go and I'll give you one hour head start.
ED	 Alright, Marshal. We're comin' out.
BRITT	 Laurel.
SHERIFF	 He wanted us to think she was one of them.
BRITT	 Laurel. Laurel, Laurel, don't leave me. Don't leave me. Laurel. Oh God, no. Oh God.
BRITT	 Oh God, stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. God no, please. Oh God, no. Oh God. Oh. Laurel. Oh God. Laurel. I'm so sorry.
CHASKA	 Many tracks have joined Jed's gang. They are being followed.
BRITT	 Can you tell how many?
CHASKA	 No.
TUCKER	 Think they've already been attacked?
CHASKA	 Tracks are less than a day old. It is possible.
BRITT	 Let's get moving.
CHASKA	 I think we should wait here till sunrise.
BRITT	 Burnin' moonlight.
CHASKA	 Trail's gettin' very difficult to read now.
BRITT	 That's why you're here.
CHASKA	 The warriors following them may also know of us. With sunlight, I can be certain. I think you were right about my eyes, they are getting old. Not as good in the dark as they used to be.
BRITT	 Well, sun rises in two hours. We'll wait till then.
TUCKER	 Oh good. Two more hours of sleepin' on hard rocks. What the hell was that?
BRITT	 Saddle the horses, we may need 'em in a hurry.
TUCKER	 Where are you goin'?
BRITT	 Just stay here, keep alert.
BRITT	 Is that a war dance?
CHASKA	 It is a celebration.
BRITT	 Oh.
CHASKA	 It'd take hours to reach â€˜em. And they'd gone by the time we do. MacMasters. MacMasters.
BRITT	 Five Sioux? Circlin' around to a front, war paint.
BRITT	 Tucker. Tucker. Tucker?
TUCKER	 Marshal. Don't bet that bank yet. I think me and Chaska, I think we're even.
BRITT	 Tucker. Tucker.
CHASKA	 Come on, Britt. Britt, come on.
CHASKA	 What the hell did he mean when he said we were even?
BRITT	 He said he learned the difference between the Sioux and the Pawnee.
JED	 Wake up.
JED	 Wake up.
JED	 Come on, wake up, kid. Sun's about to rise, we gotta get outta here.
CHAD	 Injuns?
JED	 Yeah. Little ways back, they attacked us.
JED	 We gotta make tracks, get some distance between us. With my luck, they already killed your pa.
SILAS	 Hey Jed, is that you?
JED	 Silas? Thought you was dead.
SILAS	 You know, I thought the same thing about you. When they attacked, I went out back. Thought I'd pick off an easy few.
JED	 What happened?
SILAS	 Well, my horse fell down, knocked myself out. Came to about an hour ago.
JED	 Damn.
SILAS	 Found my horse about a half a mile away.
JED	 Get up. Damn.
SILAS	 They burned their bodies back there.
JED	 How many of 'em?
SILAS	 Jed, I didn't go back for another look. But they'll be breakin' camp till mornin'.
JED	 We was just gettin' ready to vamoose.
SILAS	 Better hurry.
SILAS	 All these Injuns on the ground. I'm sure one more won't make much difference. Been hearin' a long time, how fast you are on the draw?
SILAS	 Let's find out.
JED	 What the hell was that? What the hell! Silas! Silas! Told him to look, not to attack. Son of a bitch. Silas! Silas! You leave MacMasters for me! Son of a bitch. He's a good scout. If he didn't wanna be seen, he wasn't seen. Silas! Ain't afraid of your pa, boy. This is what I've been wantin' all along.
CHAD	 But now, it's just you. No gang. I can-- I could talk to him for ya.
JED	 Talk to him for me? What's the discussion gonna be about, little mouse? Where the hanging's gonna be?
CHAD	 No.
JED	 Hey, little mouse. Bring my saddlebag, need another round of ammo.
CHAD	 What?
JED	 Bullets. I got eight rounds on me.
CHAD	 Eight?
JED	 Little mouse, bring my saddlebag. Give me extra ammo. We may have a long-shoot out.
CHAD	 Okay.
JED	 What you limping for? It's your arm got stuck.
CHAD	 I ache all over, Jed. I think I got the fever.
JED	 Hey, what's takin' you so long? You stick the ammo in your pockets? You best not be up to somethin'. Tell me, boy! Come on.
JED	 Silas. Silas! No! You know how much work I put into this? Do you? You know how long that took me? Do you? I think it's about time the cat carved up the little mouse.
CHAD	 What?
JED	 You're the only MacMasters here, you're gonna have to do.
CHAD	 Jed, no.
JED	 Let's play Catch the Bullet.
JED	 Catch the bullet now, huh? Where you goin'? Catch the bullet! Now boy, you can't run. I'm coming, I'm coming! I'm coming! Stop! Now we're gonna play Catch the Bullet. I'm gonna shoot, and you either duck or catch it. It's fun.
CHAD	 I don't wanna play Catch the Bullet. I can't play Catch the Bullet.
JED	 You're a MacMasters. Of course, you can. I need to rid myself of this feeling. This feeling that MacMasters bested me. Even when he's gone, I feel like he's bested me. 'Cause I ain't the one who killed him. I ain't got no braggin' rights. And nobody knows what I went through. But you do. That's why you're gonna catch this bullet one last time. It's comin' right for you.
CHAD	 Jed.
JED	 Go, boy! Go!
JED	 Yeah, catch it, boy. Ha, yeah.
BRITT	 I'll play Catch the Bullet with ya. Let him go.
JED	 No, I don't really like that idea. Gotten to know the kid, feel like I have to kill him. Get that ammo ready, boy.
BRITT	 Chad, where are you?
CHAD	 Shoot, pa, I'm covered.
JED	 Shut up. Ah! Dammit! Get the ammo! You almost got me, MacMasters! That was a good one. Hey! MacMasters! Where's the posse? How many you got?
BRITT	 You think you rate a posse? Just me, Jed.
JED	 Just you and me, huh? You ever think you'd go out like this? On a butte. Hey! You ain't shot back in a while, Marshal. You out of ammo?
BRITT	 Come on out in the open and find out.
JED	 Hey, that's a pretty funny joke! Think I'm dumb enough to try? Shoot back, dammit! Son of a bitch is out of ammo! Your pa is out of ammo!
BRITT	 Jed! You're right. I'm out of ammo. Old teacher of mine once told me I didn't have a brain for arithmetic.
JED	 Would you look at that? The great Marshal MacMasters.
BRITT	 Listen, Jed. I'll make a deal with ya.
JED	 I'm listenin'.
BRITT	 You let Chad right outta here and I'll stay with you.
JED	 That's a dumbass deal, Marshal.
BRITT	 Don't kill my son, Jed.
JED	 He's half-dead as it is.
BRITT	 I'm the one you want. Let him go.
JED	 First, you step out with your hands up. Leave the pistol where you are.
BRITT	 Alright. I'm coming down.
JED	 Walk where I can see ya. Got your pa now, boy. No, no.
JED	 Keep your hands up. You stay right there. Keep your hands nice and high, just like that.
BRITT	 Let Chad go, Jed.
JED	 That was your deal, not mine.
BRITT	 Why kill him?
JED	 'Cause I don't want him to grow up into his pa, who was huntin' me down.
BRITT	 I think you set him on the road for that already.
JED	 Yeah. Guess I did. That's why he dies here right now with you. That's close enough. Now how about a game of Catch the Bullet?
BRITT	 You mind if I have last smoke?
JED	 You ain't got a little pepperbox on you, do you?
BRITT	 Nope.
JED	 Real slow.
BRITT	 Now tell me about this Catch the Bullet. Who catches it? You?
JED	 Why ain't you scared?
BRITT	 Let's play. Let's see who catches the bullet.
JED	 It's time to make peace with myself.
CHAD	 Ah!
BRITT	 Come on.
BRITT	 I'm here now, son. I'm here.
BRITT	 Don't look at him, look at me. Look at me, look at me. It's over, Chad. It's over, I'm here. Oh, son. Oh.
BRITT	 Let's get these ropes off of you.
BRITT	 Yeah.
CHAD	 Yeah.
BRITT	 I'm real proud of you, son.
CHAD	 You are?
BRITT	 You bet I am.
CHAD	 I'm so sorry. I knew you would come. I'm so sorry.
CHAD	 I knew it.
BRITT	 Sorry? Sorry about what?
CHAD	 Doesn't matter now.
BRITT	 Hey, I uh, I got somethin'. Starr sent these for ya. She said they're you're favorite, right? Alright, alright. Here, you uh, you hang onto these, okay? Can you get up?
CHAD	 Yeah, it's uh...
CHAD	 So did you really run out of ammo?
BRITT	 I have plenty in my saddlebag.
CHAD	 Pa.
BRITT	 Half mile down the trail.
CHAD	 That's reckless.
BRITT	 I'm gettin' old, son.
CHAD	 Nah, I don't think so.
SHERIFF	 Well, I'm real sorry, Dex, I still haven't heard from my posse. They've been searchin' for days.
DEX	 Well, I just hope they're still alive.
SHERIFF	 I'll ask Pastor Bailey to say a prayer from 'em.
DEX	 Well, thank you. Appreciate that. The only family I got.
SHERIFF	 Yeah, I like consider them the only family I got, too.
DEX	 Yeah. My eyesight's not so good. Can you see who that is?
DEX	 I hope it's not Jed and his boys.
SHERIFF	 Looks like somebody's comin' this way, I'm not sure who. But we're gonna have company.
DEX	 Oh, we don't wanna fight.
SHERIFF	 Uh. Can't believe my eyes. It's Britt and Chad.
DEX	 I think my eyesight's improvin'. Welcome home, son.
SHERIFF	 Britt! You're alive.
BRITT	 Yeah, we're alive.
CHAD	 Grandpa! I thought you was dead.
DEX	 Well, they tried to get me, but they failed. Get up here. I'm gonna outlive all of ya.
SHERIFF	 You know, I got a whole posse out there looking for you?
BRITT	 You want me to head back out, so they can find me?
SHERIFF	 Nah. They'll give up eventually, you ain't that special.
BRITT	 Thanks a lot, Sheriff.
SHERIFF	 Come on, let's get you inside. There's a shot of whiskey with your name on it. Lord knows you deserve it.
BRITT	 I-- I'll take it.
