(VIGILANTE DIARIES)


MOREAU		You know, I realize I haven't kept you up to speed... on everything, but... the situation on the ground has changed, hasn't it? This is the part of the story where Dr. Frankenstein... looks out at the burning village and all the dead bodies... and he thinks about his creation and he says... "What the frick was I thinking?" How did those guys save the world? Jeez Greggers. It all started 10 years ago, the last mission.

OPERATOR	Say, we got that fix, Argon. It looks like we're working now.

OPERATOR 2	You got a huge force that's moving, all armed. We did see shots fired.

OPERATORS	Roger that.  Roger.

SOLDIER	Cover! Cover! Cover! Cover! Cover!

SOLDIER 2	12 o'clock! Watch 'em! Watch that left!

SOLDIER	The roof! The roof! Check the roof out! Incoming! Incoming left!

SOLDIER 2	Incoming!

SOLDIER	A bird! A bird! Take 'em out! Take 'em out!

OFFICER	Hold them here. I'll go for the package.

WOLFMAN	Remember, you still owe me 10 Gs, can't die yet. See you on the side.

SOLDIER	Men, RPG! Move out!

OFFICER	Wolfman. Wolfman, you copy?

WOLFMAN	Copy! Meet you on the south side!

OFFICER	I'm on my way.

SOLDIER	'Bout to have contact! Bring the cal! Bring the cal!

OPERATOR	Somebody's moving from the south. Over.

OFFICER	Mother-f-er.


BARRINGTON	That's Commander Mother-f-er to you. Now let's just find a way I could let you two fools walk out of here for old times' sake.

OFFICER	What the f are you doing here?
	
BARRINGTON	I'm working. What the heck are you doing here? Saving the world, man? When you gonna learn? Go on, tactical genius. See how this plays out.

WOLFMAN	Get out of here. I got this.

BARRINGTON	Yeah, go ahead. Just run off, man. Bye. Come on, man. You're not still on that old stuff, are you?

WOLFMAN	I owe you one.

BARRINGTON		Man, you need to let it go and grow the heck up. I ain't got no time for this stuff.

WOLFMAN	You gonna make time today.

BARRINGTON	Just stop. Yeah. Extraction's ready. No, just some checkers showed up to a chess game. It'll be-- Now, was that stuff necessary? Enjoy your evening.

OFFICER	He friggin' played us.

LAMONT	Nearly seven months has passed since the last sighting of the infamous self-made super hero... known as The Vigilante.

REPORTER	...made headlines last year when he allegedly killed a rising Armenian syndicate.

DE CORONADO	...que El Vigilante ha desaparecido.

THALIA	...and with his disappearance, the city's crime rates have risen by 40%.

REPORTER	Michael Hanover's web videos went viral... after being the only person to capture The Vigilante in action.

LAMONT	The question is, where is The Vigilante?

NARCO	Déjamelo.

NARCO 2	Mátenlo a ese güey. Hazlo sufrir.

RAVEN	Handsome. There's a very pissed off Armenian boss who sent me. You killed his baby brother. And this is when he saw you, Mike Hanover, the filmmaker. And now he wants you to suffer. You had no idea you were at war with the Armenian mob, did you?

ANDREAS	Wait.

WOMAN	Please! Please, I told you! I don't know where he goes! I don't know what he does!

ANDREAS	I'll tell you what he does, this friggin' joke! He puts videos on the Internet making this man to be a hero! That freaking psycho that killed my baby brother.

WOMAN	But they said The Vigilante's gone, right? That he's dead!

ANDREAS	That's not good enough. You know, they sell t-shirts with his face on 'em... and I have to look at that stuff in the street. Mike Hanover. Now, tell me where he is.

WOMAN	I don't know. I don't know. Please. 

HANOVER	You look like shoot.

NERO	Yeah, you do look like squat. That's right. That's right, bitch. Motherfricker! Die, motherfricker! Fucker! Die! Die! Die already! Die! You know what you did! Die, mother--

HANOVER	That's me, Mike Hanover, and I just killed a man in a taco shop bathroom. Hey, but he started it. I've been hiding near the border looking for The Vigilante, and hit men are on me. Wait. Is that how I really run? Anyway, I had cars, chicks, a crib... and now I got this piece-of-garbage ice cream truck... and we're on the run from the Armenian mob. It all started seven months ago with a documentary I was making. Okay, here's the back story, so pay attention. That's The Vigilante, the big dude. You met him as a Special Forces in the prologue. Not anymore. Now he is running the streets... and taking out drug dealers, gangs, you name it. He has a sidekick, too. They call him The Kid. Look, I got to tag along and document some missions...and that's what made this guy Internet famous. This last video was at a heroin lab where they were using little kids as drug mules. Can you believe that? It was messed up. So Vigilante was capping dudes left and right. Then he sent me and The Kid to hang back at his safe house while he cleaned up the mess...but this was no ordinary safe house. Oh, no. It had chicks...and it had Jade, his numero uno lady. She was like the Alfred to his Batcave, and they were this crazy couple. I should have been watching out for Red. That's right, this little hot chick that worked for Jade. I was blinded by Red. After that, we went back to the heroin spot to pick up The Vigilante...but it was still crawling with bad guys...and he was after these guys something fierce. The Armenian mob and him was about to hit the fan.

ARMENIAN	Don't move! Don't move!

THUG	Get your hands up!

HANOVER	Then it all made sense. They wanted him there to get Vigilante out in the open. It was a setup. No one's seen or heard from The Vigilante since. After all that, he was just gone, just like that When The Kid and I came back to find the safe-house girls dead, we knew it. We knew it was a setup. Oh, shoot. It's Jade right here.

JADE	This network secure?

HANOVER	Look, they might be able to hack into my porn... but other than that, we're good.

JADE	Good.

HANOVER	You feeling okay?

JADE	I'm fine.

HANOVER	Are you sure?

JADE	I said I'm fine.

HANOVER	You don't look so hot, all right? I mean, you're still hot. I'd bang the shoot out of you--

JADE	Mike, shut up. Listen to me.

HANOVER	Okay, what?

JADE	Intel over the Mexican cartel feeds...have them holding an American captive for the Armenian mob. Could be him.

HANOVER	Shoot!

JADE	Yeah. No other reason why the Armenians and Mexicans could be working together.

HANOVER	The Kardashians could be having a quinceañera. I know a guy that can help.

JADE	You know a guy?

HANOVER	Yeah, I know a guy, all right? Gay Barry. He got me out of a few jams in L.A. That's what he does. You know, he's just one of those connected dudes. I didn't know if he was CIA or worked for the Apple Store, but he just knows stuff. I guarantee he knows some "Call of Duty" type dudes.

JADE	I'll send someone over now.

HANOVER	Who?

JADE	Don't worry about it. The less you know, the better.

HANOVER	Okay, as long as the dude is cool, he'll be fine, all right? Barry's a little weird.

JADE	Weird?

HANOVER	Eccentric.

JAKE	There's someone here for Barry!

MARTA	Barry!


BARRY	You interrupted my swim lesson! This is Jake. He's my swim coach. Jake, go in the house. Wipe that oil off before you sit on the couch.


JAKE	Okay.

KID	Bro, you know why I'm here. You gonna help me or not?

BARRY	I would help you if you'd learn some manners. You can't just walk around like you're Baby Blade and break in to people's homes. What's up with Generation Me? None of you guys give a crap about anything.

KID	You gonna help me or not?

BARRY	Okay, I'll help you. But first, Marta, get him a sugar-free Red Bull.

MARTA	Oh, my-- ¿Otra vez es empezar? Really? Vienes y traes a un negro aquí. ¿Y qué quieres que piense yo?

BARRY	He's not here to meet me!

MARTA	Yo ni siquiera dije eso!

BARRY	Half of what you said is not in my Rosetta Stone!

MARTA	Déjame en paz. Déjame en paz.

BARRY	It's kind of-- It's almost like an arranged thing.

MARTA	Vas a seguir con seguir.

BARRY	Marta! I want my freaking burrito after my meeting! So, Vigilante, huh? I like his work. Actually, when Mike called me, I got a boner for it. Didn't say you'd be coming now.

KID	Yeah, Jade likes to keep us separate. Safer that way.

BARRY	Yeah, smart girl. So, how did it work? Were you in the Big Brother program...and Vigilante just walks in and says, "I'll take the black one"?

KID	Forget you.

BARRY	Touchy, are we?

KID	What is all this?

BARRY	Every tactical op in the state. F.B.I., CIA, A.T.F. Even some chatter from local terrorist cells, too. I just monitor it, look for patterns.

KID	For what?

BARRY	Hey, just because I don't get up at dawn anymore and do pushups, doesn't mean I don't love my country.


BARRY	You ever heard of SEAL Team Six?
	
KID	You were a SEAL?

BARRY	Yeah, I was a SEAL. "Don't ask, don't tell," it's freaking bullcrap. Besides, I'm still doing my part to keep a-holes like you safe. Oh, here it is. Okay, now the last thing we got from Mike...has your boy right here just south of the border in Mexico. I know the perfect guys for this. Ex-Blackwater studs, bored and badass. They'll do this.

KID	How you know they'll do it?

BARRY	Trust me, they'll do it. Marta! Get the car!

MARTA	What? No, no, no. Ya te dije que yo no iba a hacer nada para ti. No empieces ahorita, por favor.

BARRY	I can't get a divorce. It's part of my cover.

WOMAN	Hey, think someone's here for you.

BARRY	Hey, what's up?

WOLFMAN	Gay Barry!

BARRY	Wolfman.

WOLFMAN	Gay Barry, man! What the heck, man?

BARRY	We gotta talk. I got us a gig. It's big.

WOLFMAN	Let's do this, man. Let's talk.

BARRY	It's huge, like 12 inches.

WOLFMAN	Come on, man. Let's go talk, man.

BARRY	You look good. You been training?

WOLFMAN	Don't touch me, man. Mexico?

BARRY	Just the border.

WOLFMAN	You have positive I.D.?

BARRY	Enough.

GEEK	And you can trust the intel?

WOLFMAN	Who's paying?


BARRY	Rich white kid from the B.H. He's got the money, trust me. He'll meet you guys in Tecate, blitz extraction. You'll be back in the U.S. before you know it. It's all good.

HOLLYWOOD	What's going on here?

WOLFMAN	Time to go back to work.

BARRY	Chillax. He's with me. Gentlemen, meet Kid.

WOLFMAN	Is you going black now, Barry? Once you go black, man--

KID	Hey, forget you, man.

WOLFMAN	Now chill out, little toy soldier.

TEX-MEX	A little badass, this one, huh?

WOLFMAN	Yeah.

BARRY	This little badass is Vigilante's sidekick.

KID	Don't call me his friggin' sidekick. Look, Barry says y'all are who we need to get this done. The Vigilante's being held at the border by the cartels, and I need some more guns. Simple as that.

WOLFMAN	What do you think, Geek?

GEEK	If the intel's solid, I'm game.

TEX-MEX	I like paydays.

BARRY	It's true, Mexicans like paydays. Oh, come on. Mucho dinero, right? Come on, I'm just kidding.

KID	So, what's up? Can we do this or what?

WOLFMAN	There's only one thing I like doing more than chicks...it's making money.

DAVIT	Up! Everyone! Hurry. Get out. What the freak are you doing? What the freak--

ANDREAS	Hey! He was our brother.

DAVIT	You're ignoring your business, my business. You need to end this. Just kill that monster and get it on with.

ANDREAS	But we're not done yet. I want the man who made The Vigilante a hero.

DAVIT	You bring us down!


ANDREAS	But I run this family.

DAVIT	Father was right.

MALE VOICE V.O.	Take the shot. Take the shot. Take the shot.

VIGILANTE INTO RADIO	Two males. Cannot confirm I.D.

MOREAU	Green on both.

VIGILANTE	We could've got names out of him.

MOREAU	He was the name.

VIGILANTE	What are you doing? They're gonna be coming any minute.

MOREAU	Ain't nobody coming in here.

VIGILANTE	What are you talking about?

MOREAU	You were gonna pull on me there, weren't you? I saw it in your eyes. Yeah. Your training's far from over, son. Let's face it. I'm freakin' hungry. Let's go get some breakfast....come back to haunt you. Man's gotta be careful nowadays. If he's too good at what he does...it can come back to haunt you. Whole world's in an upheaval. Sometimes, when you're needed...you gotta take care of business. Your identity's gonna be erased from all the databases, foreign and domestic. It'll be like you were never even born, like you never existed. You understand your commitment? And there is no discharge from this service, son. You're never gonna live a normal life again. You're a stone-cold killer. Plain and simple. No family, no next of kin. Everybody's gonna want you. CIA, Rangers, SEALs. This ain't like that at all. Those fellas get to go home at night...see their families, kiss their wives, and  play with their kids. Build that little white fence around the house, and, you know, sing hallelujah. Your country needs you, plain and simple. You follow?

VIGILANTE	I do.

MOREAU	All right. Good luck.

RAVEN	I guess it's not your time.

THUG	Vámonos! Vámonos por el otro--

WOLFMAN	Spread out! Find him!

HOLLYWOOD	I'll take the back! Barry! Cover Geek!

BARRY	You got this. You monkey lovers! This is Gucci!

WOLFMAN	Shoot! You the mothertrucker we been looking for? You still owe me 10 Gs. You remember that?

KID	Now's not the time.

TEX-MEX	We have to go now!

BARRY	I believe this is yours.

HANOVER	Yeah! Holy shoot! Ow! Yes! Shoot! Jade, they freakin' did it! They got him! We got him! He's okay! They did it!

JADE	Copy that.

HANOVER	Man, you should-- It was insane! You should've seen this stuff, the action! There was RPGs, and there was land mines...and freakin' night vision and freakin' machine-- Buh-brat! Brrat! Brrat! Hip-hip-togan! Hip-hip-togan! I even saw freakin' kuh-tai-sin! Kuh-to-sin! It was freaking awesome!

JADE	Mike, shut up!

HANOVER	Oh, my God, wait! The Kid! The Kid was with them!

JADE	I know. I know.

HANOVER	Wait. What? You know?

JADE	Of course. I've always known. What did I say? Safer to keep us separate. Anyway, now that he's back, it'll all be okay now. Things will be different... and we can move-- move on.

HANOVER	Jade! Jade! The hell? Holy shoot, Red!

RED	Get out of the ice cream truck.
	
HANOVER	I thought you were dead.

RED	Shut up. Now.

HANOVER	What are you doing? What are you doing?

RED	You really are an idiot. I have the package.

BARRINGTON	Enough with the military lingo. I'm a civilian now. I'm tired of hearing that stuff. Now, you kidnapped the rich kid, right? Now don't say affirmative. Say yes.

RED	Yes. I'm bringing him to you.

BARRINGTON	Heck, no. Your boyfriend, the dude that looks like Dracula, he still wants revenge, right? So bring the rich kid to him. Let him have some fun.


RED	The Vigilante's still on the streets.

BARRINGTON	Good! That freaking gorilla draws so much attention, let the cops and the feds hunt his butt.

RED	We can get to him.

BARRINGTON	No, no, no. I have plans for him. Now, is that it?

RED	Yeah.

BARRINGTON	Enjoy your evening.

MOREAU	Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. You should get that looked at, you know.

VIGILANTE	Soon, yeah. What the f happened over there?

MOREAU	Nothing you need to know about.

VIGILANTE	It's my life. I'd like to know what the heck is going on.

MOREAU	Your life? It's not your life anymore. You gave that to me. It belongs to me now. You made a commitment. I didn't beg you for that. You don't remember, do you?

VIGILANTE	That was different. It was for my country.

MOREAU	No, it's for the world. All you gotta remember is infiltrate, pull the trigger...and get the heck out. Outside of that, there's nothing more to talk about. And if we've reached an impasse...there's gonna be a conclusion that you're not gonna like one bit. I should have seen this coming. I saw your psyche tests, you know. Propensity for rebellion and challenge of authority...and borderline bipolar and all that, you know?

VIGILANTE	Look, I don't need to hear that freakin' crap now. Come on.

MOREAU	It's been a short time, okay? Get used to it. You haven't been around that long. I don't wanna, you know, put down your world view...but it's never been about good versus the bad. It's about keeping the powerful in power. There's no out for you. There's no out for me. There's only the next mission.

VIGILANTE	This is what you did with that Arab cash.

WOLFMAN	We rediversified, man. I be flipping cars. Tex be making tamales and selling them. And dude right here, man, he opened up a gym. What's the name of your gym? XPC? DFG?

HOLLYWOOD	EPX.


KID	We got a problem. I just got this.

VIGILANTE	What the frick?

KID	Mike had to open up to communicate with us about the feed. They were watching. They found him.

VIGILANTE	Jesus.

WOLFMAN	Who's they?

VIGILANTE	The entire Armenian mob. They don't like me.

WOLFMAN	Nobody likes you. Those dudes don't play. Half of 'em ex-military. Your boy's dead.

TEX-MEX	Wolfman...we did our job. Here we are...and there he is safe and sound. Just show me the freakin' money.

BARRY	There is no money if he freakin' dies! This funky white guy is the one who's paying! I suggest you start planning a rescue operation.

HOLLYWOOD	From the Armenian mob?

BARRY	Yeah.

HOLLYWOOD	That's not a rescue, that's war.

WOLFMAN	Look, I'll take a rain check for saving your ass...but this rich d-bag who own daddy won't pay to save him...that ain't on us, man. This is your stuff.

VIGILANTE	It is on me, just me. I need wheels.

GEEK	Got you. Gear's in the bag.

BARRY	You don't know where Mike Hanover is.

KID	Of course I know where he's at. Planted a tracker on that dumb-ass the day I met him. The only person I trust is that big dude right over there.

TEX-MEX	So, what's up? We ain't getting paid?

WOLFMAN	The dude still owe me 10 Gs. Nobody get paid around him.

VIGILANTE	What is that? It's close.

KID	There's his ass right there, that black BMW

VIGILANTE	All right, give him space. He's going in that garage.

KID	I got him.

VIGILANTE	Hang back. What the heck is this? It's a setup! Go! Move!

HANOVER	Whoa. Hello!

RAVEN	Someone wants to say hello.

HANOVER	Oh, Dad, come on!

MR HANOVER	Can you two please stop?

RAVEN	Stop what? Stop this?

MR HANOVER	Look, tell your boss I have what he wants.

HANOVER	Dad, look, don't pay. You know how much I used to pay to get tied up... and get this kind of treatment?

MR HANOVER	Jiminy Cricket. Can you believe this kid?

HANOVER	No, no, no. Listen. Have you seen the ass on this one? Right? She's hot, and she's Asian!

MR HANOVER	Michael, will you shut up?

RAVEN	Shut the frick up!

MR HANOVER	Look, tell that Armenian... I got his money, and I'm sending it now.

RAVEN	This idiot's really your son?

MR HANOVER	Yes, that idiot is really my son.

ANDREAS	Raven...make our guest feel at home.

HANOVER	So, anyway, really, though, what's your name? Listen, whatever my dad's paying you, I'll pay you double. Now, all I wanna do is just have a little fun here.

RAVEN	This is going to be fun.

HANOVER	It will be fun. Is that what you're saying? You're agreeing to my terms?

RAVEN	Oh, yes.

HANOVER	Yeah, I have a camera we can use. A little video?

RAVEN	What shall I do to you next? You naughty boy

TEX-MEX	We ain't gonna let you go by yourself, man.

WOLFMAN	You're still easy to track.

VIGILANTE	This one's not gonna be pretty.

WOLFMAN	It never is.

BOUNCER	Hello, ladies. Come on in. Right in here. See me later, okay? Look at these idiots. Halloween's next month. Come back then. Hey!

TEX-MEX	How we doing?

FRIGHTENED WOMAN	Fine.

TEX-MEX	I'll be right back.

RAVEN	You like that, don't you, you little squirt?

HANOVER	All right! Look, that's my boys coming, all right? So, why don't you just untie me and just run? But first, give me your e-mail.

WOLFMAN	Hey.

RED	You freaking idiot. Where we going?

ANDREAS	To the sky, baby.

WOLFMAN	Hey, what you always doing on the floor?

VIGILANTE	Frigging piece of crap got away.

WOLFMAN	Let's go get your boy.

TEX-MEX	I'll call for a pickup.

RAVEN	Shoot.

HANOVER	All right, look, look, hold up! Why don't we ju--

RAVEN	Give me that, you little shi--

HANOVER	Just wait! Not again!

VIGILANTE	What the heck are you doing?

HANOVER	Dude, man, it is so good to see you.

WOLFMAN	What the heck's going on here, man?

HANOVER	Another sidekick? 

WOLFMAN	Dude, he's my sidekick.

HANOVER	Fair enough. Hey!

WOLFMAN	No, no. We good. We gotta go, man. We gotta go.

HANOVER	That's awesome, dude. You got a "V" on you! Symbol. That's dope.

BARRY	Give me the guns, you freakin' lunatics! You can't have these in the streets!

VIGILANTE	Get you next time.

WOLFMAN	All right, man.

HANOVER	Next time, right?

WOLFMAN	Hey, dude. Get back, man.

MR HANOVER	Mike! Can you see me?

HANOVER	Yeah.

MR HANOVER	Look, kid, just come home.

HANOVER	Home home?

MR HANOVER	You need anything?

HANOVER	I think I'll be all right.

VIGILANTE	Yeah.

MOREAU	Hot on patrol?

VIGILANTE	Every friggin' day. What do you want, Moreau?

MOREAU	Think of this as a common courtesy call to a former protégé. That's all.

VIGILANTE	I'm hanging up.

MOREAU	You know, I told you a long time ago...it's not about right or wrong, okay? I think, you know, you decided somewhere along the way...to use your infinite powers to...start a war, to go solo. You wanted a war, well, now you got one, don't you? But you went too far, went too public. Went after the guys who are paying the bills. What's gonna happen then? They're gonna call me, right?

VIGILANTE	Good. I'll be looking out for you.

MOREAU	Yeah, that's nice, but...you got a lot more to worry about than that, you know, family and all.

VIGILANTE	Family? What the heck are you talking about?

MOREAU	The infamous Vigilante... gone soft. Is that it?

VIGILANTE	You said you're comin' after me? Don't bother, I'm on my way.

MOREAU	I'll be right here waiting.

BARRINGTON	I think you still have a soft spot for that maniac.

MOREAU	That's a very dangerous man, and you just took his friggin' wife.

BARRINGTON	No, "we" just took his friggin' wife.

MOREAU	I'm gonna disappear for a while, okay? And so should you.

BARRINGTON	Man, I'm a businessman. I got work to do. Besides, I'm not worried about your boy right now. I'll keep his attention far away from me for a while. Send his ass to Armenia. Let's remove Mr. Moreau from my contact list.

WOMAN	Copy that.

BARRINGTON	Make a left over here.

MOREAU	You know, agents will flip-flop, and ops will go sideways. Best laid plans can turn into a gigantic cluster-buff. It happens. So I had to improvise and...rein things in...without declaring our asset a total loss. I tried everything I could think of to get him on a leash and...But he's feral, Christ. That's another word for a stray animal. Or a rogue or a ronin or...whatever the freak you wanna call him, but...You know, I trained him right, and...once he's dead set...there ain't no stopping him. And that is a freakin' fact.

ANDREAS	Mother. Father. I've brought my brothers home. I couldn't meet your expectations.

CLERGYMAN	You can change all that. No need for that. God is your friend. God is always your friend. Let's go, my son.

TRAIN STATION SIGN	Welcome to Glasgow Central Station

THUG	You should never have come back to Glasgow.

VIGILANTE	I need information.

THUG	We're not in that line of work anymore.

VIGILANTE	All right. You're not gonna drink?

THUG	No, we're good.

VIGILANTE	You gonna help me or not?

THUG	We'll help you, but not in here. We'll talk outside.

VIGILANTE	Okay. Let's go.

THUG	How you been?

VIGILANTE	Good.

THUG	Been a long time since Dublin, eh?

VIGILANTE	I've been trying to forget that mess.

THUG	You're still a hard fella, eh?

ANDREAS	You sent your dogs all the way out here...to my home... with me? When is this game over?

BARRINGTON	When I'm done playing.

ANDREAS	I am done playing.

BARRINGTON	The chess pieces don't get to decide when the game is over, now, do they? No. Somebody has to think it through, be three moves ahead before he moves one piece. And you're a very valuable piece. Like my bishop. And I need you in the game.

ANDREAS	What do you want?

BARRINGTON	I have what I want. I'm trusting you with it.

ANDREAS	What is this?

BARRINGTON	That's my pawn. She'll bring him right to you.

ANDREAS	The American?

BARRINGTON	Yep, your enemy. The man who killed your brothers.

ANDREAS	I will find him myself. I don't need to kidnap babies to do it. Why are you keeping me here?

BARRINGTON	Because I need you there, that's why. And I need him there, too, alive and drawing fire in his direction. See, the you-versus-him thing, that's just a diversion. The real battle's bigger than both of you, and you're just a soldier...so take your freakin' orders! Freakin' Count Chocula-looking mother-f-er.

SOLDIER	Sir.

BARRINGTON	Just keep it going.

FEMALE VOICE OVER P.A	Welcome to Westminster Station. If you are riding the Piccadilly Line, mind the gap. Next stop, Piccadilly Circus.


BARRY	Well, there she is. Give me a kiss. Come on! That's what you do! We're in Europe!

VIGILANTE	What do you got for me?

BARRY	I have information. Come on, let's go for a walk. Since getting here, I feel like crap. It's always dark. It always rains. And I know it sounds crazy, I kind of miss my wife.

VIGILANTE	What do you got for me?

BARRY	Here. Come over here. So, I've got good news and I've got bad news. The good news is I found Jade. The bad news is she's in Yerevan, Armenia.

VIGILANTE	Again with the Armenians?

BARRY	That Andreas has a real hard-on for you.

VIGILANTE	You told me they were both dead, they died when the chopper blew up.

BARRY	It was bad intel, I know. You're gonna run into Red while you're there, too. She's kind of runnin' the show down there. She's a real bitch.

VIGILANTE	They sold my family to the Armenians.

BARRY	You know it's a trap, right? They're gonna freaking kill you. I don't even know why you're going.

VIGILANTE	Thanks for this.

BARRY	No problem, man.  All right, good luck. I hope you don't die.

THE LION	So you are his girl, huh? You know he killed my cousins, too? If I find out you were involved in it...I'll come back and smash your neck just like this. But you know, I'm a good babysitter, as well.

BARRY	Welcome to Yerevan. It's nice, huh? Okay, look right there. See the big guy? That's The Lion. That's Andreas' bodyguard. Follow him, and you'll find Andreas. Find Andreas, and you'll find your family. A kid will approach you tonight at the opera house. Okay, ciao.

THE LION	You've done well for yourself in our absence. We are happy for you. But now it is time for you to step down. I'm sure you understand now, Andreas has returned.

TAREQ	I don't think that will work.

THE LION	Don't rush your answer and we will let you continue earning. Think very hard before you answer. Listen. So you think that...Andreas can play around in America for yearswhile I work my ass off, and then just hand it over to him?


TAREQ	Or else what?

THE LION	Or else...we kill you now.

RED	How do you shut this thing up?

JADE	Give her to me.

RED	I can't.

JADE	Give her to me. She's hungry.

RED	I said no.

JADE	Red, give me the baby! You work for me!

RED	Not anymore.

ANDREAS	Amen.

CLERGYMAN	You are here, my son. Talk to me, you will feel better. What have you done now, Andreas?

ANDREAS	My soul. I sold my soul.

CLERGYMAN	You cannot be worthy of receiving God's blessings...and throw away the most important one of them all. Your eternal soul. Andreas my son...don't meddle in God's work. He sees all and hears all. Don't take it upon yourself, the work of God. We're mortals. It is above our understanding.

RED	Andreas. They're ready for you. They need you. I need you.

VIGILANTE	You ready to go to work, Short Round?

BOY	Please! My uncle wants an autograph. Please! He loves Mr. Andreas. He needs a job, please.

BODYGUARD	I'm begging you.

BOY	Get lost, kid.

VIGILANTE	He's exaggerating.

BODYGUARD	Where are you from?

BOY	He's my uncle. Just one autograph.

VIGILANTE	Just one. Just one.

BODYGUARD #2	Where is your accent from? You are not Armenian.


VIGILANTE	Just one. Just one.

BOY	Holy shit, bro!

VIGILANTE	It was a boring conversation, anyway.

RED	This is freaking ridiculous!

VIGILANTE	I agree, this is freaking ridiculous. Don't make a scene. And you, this isn't gonna be like last time. This is gonna be all three of us leaving together... and you take me right to them. Now move. Move!

JADE	Somebody help me! Please! I feel sick! I feel sick. Mommy's here.

ANDREAS	You are freaking dead.

VIGILANTE	I heard that before.

RED	You will never--

VIGILANTE	Shut the f up. You don't get to talk.

THE LION	What's happening over there?

ANDREAS	What do you think is happening?

THE LION	What should I do?

ANDREAS	Kill him!

VIGILANTE	Don't even think about it.

ANDREAS	We've been here before.

RED	Andreas?

VIGILANTE	Just tell me where she is.

ANDREAS	I don't think so.

VIGILANTE	You think I'm playing?

ANDREAS	No, I don't.

RED	Andreas, don't! Don't do this!

THE LION	Andreas, run!

VIGILANTE	Get down! Get down!


THE LION	Go around! I'll get you on the other side! Andreas, what's happening?

ANDREAS	Stop the car! Stop the car!

THE LION	Hurry! Hurry! Get out! Andreas, hurry!

ANDREAS	We're switching cars!

THE LION	Hurry! Get in!

ANDREAS	Drive! Drive! Let's go!

VIGILANTE	Give me your car! Give me your car! Give me your car.

DRIVER #2	Take it. Take the car.

ANDREAS	Go right! Go right!

VIGILANTE	Frick.

THE LION	The fricker.

ANDREAS	I got this mother!

JADE	You know it's not over.

VIGILANTE	I know.

BARRY	You just land?

VIGILANTE	Yeah.

BARRY	Where are they?

VIGILANTE	Safe. What the heck is going on?

BARRY	Desmond Barrington is what the frick's going on.

VIGILANTE	Barrington's behind this?

BARRY	Desmond Barrington was behind the whole thing. He played you. He played the Armenians. He's been behind it the whole freaking time, man. And now he's getting paid to tip the global scales.

VIGILANTE	Where's Barrington now?

BARRY	He's here in Los Angeles. Look, you're gonna see him tonight at a high rollers game, okay? You're gonna have to look slick. None of that "Call of Duty" armor BS, okay? You got a tux?

VIGILANTE	Tux? Why?

BARRY	New Kid'll fill you in.

VIGILANTE	Wait. The New Kid?

BARRY	Yeah. You can thank me later.

VIGILANTE	Barry vouched for you?

NEW KID	No, Barry vouched for you. I'm The New Kid.

VIGILANTE	All right. Run it by me again.

NEW KID	Members only. No guns. Metal detectors and pat-downs. Barrington's in there tonight celebrating some deal he's about to close. I get us in. We find him, isolate him...squeeze him for intel. Then we pop him.

VIGILANTE	No, we don't pop a guy like Barrington.

NEW KID	Your call.

VIGILANTE	You wearing that?

NEW KID	Nah, bro.

VIGILANTE	All right. Let's go.

WOMAN	So, you a member of this club?

VIGILANTE	I haven't decided yet.

WOMAN	When are you gonna decide?

VIGILANTE	Hey, look, I'm gay, all right?

NEW KID	Leave!

VIGILANTE	We good? It's gonna get ugly, you know.

NEW KID	I got this.

VIGILANTE	I like that.

BARRINGTON	Haven't seen you here before.

NEW KID	I've seen you.

BARRINGTON	Is that right?

NEW KID	Okay. Don't say a freaking word until I say so.

BARRINGTON	You know, guns are not allowed in here. So, where'd you hide that one?


NEW KID	Don't worry about it. And before my buddy comes over here and ruins everything...you're gonna tell me what's going down tonight.

BARRINGTON	Who might your buddy be? Oh, let me guess. That psycho who thinks he's a hero, huh? Do it. Go ahead, right? I deserve it. I did just get paid a billion dollars to set off nuclear IEDs all over the city.

NEW KID	Why don't you call that off before I shoot you in the head? Better me than my friend.

BARRINGTON	Nah, 'cause now it's time for my friend to come and ruin everything.

SWAN	You chose the wrong trick, bitch.

BARRINGTON	As much as I'm into the girl-on-girl action... I'd like to stay here and watch, but you're dead already. Everyone in here is. Enjoy your evening.

NEW KID	Where are you going?

SWAN	Come and get it.

NEW KID	Oh, I plan on it, bitch.

MAN	Security, guy at the bar, take him out now! No guns! Tasers only!

SWAN	See, bitch? I do my job!

BARRY	Com check. Get outside. The Kid has Barrington's driver.

VIGILANTE	Fudge. You okay?

NEW KID	Barrington's on foot. He's got IEDs set all over the city. He's got the abort codes on his phone.

VIGILANTE	Make the call. You take care of that.

BARRY	Okay, it's game time, guys. All right, we can't let Barrington get away. World, like, literally depends on it. Kid, where are we at?

NEW KID	This is the parking garage. Find the Bentley, P5.

BARRY	The L.A. bomb's just a diversion, guys. He's taking out cities all over the world.

NEW KID	Yeah, well, even his diversion's gonna level downtown. We've got no time. This comes first.

BARRY	Relax. I got a guy on it.

WOLFMAN	Aw, heck, no. Hey, man, you got me out here all dressed up. Man, I'm lookin' fly as hell tonight, man. I was supposed to be the bomb. You didn't tell me that there was a real bomb! What am I supposed to do with this, man? I ain't messing up my uncle's tux.

BARRINGTON	Click, click. Now, toss your stuff.

MALL COP	What you got going on here?

WOLFMAN	Mall cop, get the heck out of here. This is a dirty bomb.

MALL COP	Still can't park here.

WOLFMAN	I ain't playing with you. This stuff can blow up the whole city.

MALL COP	So, that's an actual bomb?

WOLFMAN	Damn right.

MALL COP	Okay.

WOLFMAN	Yo, what's up, man? How this gonna go down? Walk me through this.

BARRY	Walk you through it? I thought you were demo! Look, I'm too busy to help you out, all right? I'm getting pings from all over the world. New York, Sydney, Hong Kong, Mumbai. If Vigilante doesn't get Barrington, we are--

NEW KID	Vigilante has to get to Barrington's cell. That's where the codes are at. It's inside his jacket pocket.

BARRINGTON	Still don't understand how things work, do you?

VIGILANTE	I guess I don't work that way.

BARRINGTON	Clearly. That's why your gun's over there. What? You think I'm a bad guy.

VIGILANTE	Whatever.

BARRINGTON	You ever heard of the trolley problem?

VIGILANTE	Freakin' trolley. It's 2016, man. Frigging over.

BARRINGTON	No, the trolley problem. It's a dilemma. Okay, there's a runaway trolley on a track. There's five people tied to that track. Now, there's one person tied to another track...and there's a switch that diverts the trolley, okay? Now, do you let nature take its course...and let those five people get killed by that trolley...or do you flip the switch? See, me, I flip the switch every time...whether it's 500,000 people saving 500 million. You get it?

VIGILANTE	That makes you feel good?

BARRINGTON	Yeah. Yeah.

VIGILANTE	That bomb downtown...I got a "Hurt Locker" genius working on it right now. There's no bomb he can't defuse.

WOLFMAN	Oh, baby Jesus, please help me. Why do these wires gotta be so small?

MALL COP	Such thick fingers.

WOLFMAN	Man, shut up!

MALL COP	I don't think you're supposed to sweat on those like that. You gonna do the red wire? It's always the red wire in movies.

WOLFMAN	Are you a bomb specialist?

MALL COP	No, but 17, 15...

WOLFMAN	No, no, don't do that. Shut up! Don't do that!

MALL COP	13... Stay calm! Stay calm!

WOLFMAN	Shut up!

MALL COP	15 seconds! Stay calm!

WOLFMAN	Shut up! Screw it.

MALL COP	It worked!

WOLFMAN	What's my name? What's my name?

MALL COP	I don't know! bOh, my God. We saved the city!

WOLFMAN	I saved the city.

MALL COP	You saved the city!

WOLFMAN	I saved the city, man.

MALL COP	You freakin' saved the city!

WOLFMAN	I did it! I did it!

MALL COP	My black person.

WOLFMAN	Hey, watch your mouth.

NEW KID	L.A.'s good. Barry, where are we at?

BARRY	Hey, good job, Wolfie, but let's not get too excited just yet...'cause the main event's about to go live worldwide.

NEW KID	Am I seeing this right? There's surges all over.

VIGILANTE	That Pakistani guy you chopped up...

MAN	I don't know!

VIGILANTE	 ...these guys ain't too happy about it.

MASKED MEN	Get in the car! Get in the car!

NEW KID	Tell me you've got that phone!

BARRY	He did and took an arm for it. It's hurting me. Ouch. Here's the abort hack. Go.

MAN	We've got Barrington. He's safe.

DRIVER	Where to now, boss?

BARRINGTON	We head outside the blast radius and get ready for detonation. That mother's funny.

VIGILANTE	These are ready to launch, man, right now!

BARRY	- 1-1-3-8. Type it in.

VIGILANTE	Okay, I got it.

BARRY	- 1-1-- What's your deal?

VIGILANTE	I got it! Oh... I had it upside down.

BARRY	Are you serious!

NEW KID	Oh, my God! Come on!

BARRY	We're responsible for the apocalypse! Bye-bye, London. Tokyo, you're gone. I don't even want to watch. I don't even want to watch. I don't even want to watch. Holy cow, we did it! We did it! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Hey, guys...we saved the f-in' world, man.

NEW KID	I'm coming to get you, V.

LAMONT	The Vigilante is definitely back. A bloodbath tonight at a downtown Los Angeles nightspot.

FEMALE REPORTER	Over here outside a downtown nightclub...

MALE REPORTER	The Vigilante...

DE CORONADO	El Vigilante...

FANS	Vigilante!


FEMALE REPORTER #2	Continuing coverage tonight, I'm joined by Mike Hanover, web filmmaker...famous for his viral hit, "The Vigilante Diaries". And it appears that The Vigilante is back.

HANOVER	That's right. He's back. I'm back. We're back, man. I'm the guy behind the guy. That was me. I put him on the Web. I made his (bleep) famous. That's right.

FEMALE REPORTER #2	So, what about the reports we're hearing that The Vigilante saved the city?

HANOVER	He saved the city. I saved the city. That's what we do, all right? We save (bleep). Last month, we saved the city from a mob, a big mob. And you know what? He went overseas without me, and I'm not gonna hold that against you, Vigi...but, you know what? I like fish and chips and pints and all that good stuff. But I'm here holding down the fort. I'm here in the City of Angels. You know Bond's guy, the intel guy? I'm that guy, but I'm better. That's right.

FEMALE REPORTER #2	Okay, we'll keep this on topic. So, does that mean that you're still involved in The Vigilante's affairs?

HANOVER	That's what I've been saying. I'm always involved, involved some way, one way or another, right? So, Vigi, hit me up, man. I'm ready for that next mission. I got a new camera. I can document the (bleep) out of it! And you can come, too, if you want it, girl.

FEMALE REPORTER #2	Okay. Thanks. We're gonna toss it back to the studio.

CRAZY JOE	That's one hell of a story.

MOREAU	Yeah, it's damn good, isn't it? One more for my colleague over here. I gotta know...100%... you're in.

BARRINGTON	You know you should've had me in the loop from the start, right?

MOREAU	Yeah.

BARRINGTON	Yeah. Could've saved you a lot of time and money. Lot of mothertruckers would still be alive, too.

MOREAU	Yeah. Then there's that. But I wanted to do it my own way.

BARRINGTON	Yeah. When you wanna catch Frankenstein's monster...you don't use Count Chocula or the Wolfman or the "Mommy."

MOREAU	"Mommy." Yeah, that's funny. Yeah. Threw that in there, yeah.

BARRINGTON	You wanna catch the monster, use the Invisible Man. I'll bring him in.

MOREAU	Well, yeah... But make sure he's still alive...'cause he's very freakin' expensive.

CRAZY JOE	Don't make a mess. They came in before you did.

BARRINGTON	So...you want the guy playing with his phone, or the clown with the H.K. behind us...pretending like he's drunk?

MOREAU	I think I'll take the guy on the phone. Sorry about the mess.

CRAZY JOE	I'll see you next time, bro.

MOREAU	I'm feeling hungry, man. Let's go get something to eat.

BARRINGTON	Cool.

VIGILANTE	I really should get this looked at.

NEW KID	Come on, don't be a piece. You're fine.

JADE	Hey. Are you okay?

VIGILANTE	Yeah, I'm good.

JADE	Oh, good. Hey, listen, I'm kind of exhausted. Can you please stop at the store for me? I really need some diapers, some formula, but it has to be organic.

NEW KID	Bro, you're a dad?

JADE	 ...a pacifier. Oh, you know...

NEW KID	There's a shipment of heroin and AK-47s being smuggled into San Diego. We can intercept it. Two-hour straight shoot down the 5.

JADE	She smiled at me today. And, oh, her little dimple...

NEW KID 	Doughnut?

JADE	Hello? Are you there? Hello? Hello?

CLERGYMAN	I warned you, Andreas. Don't meddle in God's work.
