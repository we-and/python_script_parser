(CRANKY CHRISTMAS')


Thomas	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

Thomas	Owning up to your mistakes. 

Thomas	Christmas is a very exciting time, but it's also a very busy time, especially on Sodor. 

Thomas	And when you're rushing, accidents are more likely to happen.

Thomas	That's what happened to Cranky when he dropped a crate. 

Thomas	Cranky didn't want to get into trouble, so he hid the crate, instead of telling anyone. 

Thomas	This led to confusion and delay. 

Thomas	Cranky spent the day worrying about his mistake. 

Thomas	...But luckily nothing in the crate was actually broken. 

Thomas	Cranky realised he should have owned up to his mistake, instead of trying to hide it. Being honest and admitting when you’ve made a mistake is the best thing to do.  

Thomas	That's why it's always best to own up to your mistakes.
