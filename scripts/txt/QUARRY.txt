MAN ON RADIO	(speaking foreign language)

SUBTITLE	Can you leave the pitcher please?

LUIS	(speaking foreign language) Can you leave the pitcher, please?  (speaking English) My name is Luis Martin.  I come from Ohio.  Not original, of course.

REVEREND	Where are you going?

LUIS	Down toward El Golfo de Mexico some little town I've never heard of.  Plenty of those in Texas.

REVEREND	How far?

LUIS	A few hours.  And you?  You are headed?

REVEREND	South.

LUIS	On foot?  No food?  No water?  Where did you start from?

REVEREND	You ask a lot of questions.

WAITRESS	(speaking foreign language) You friend's a real charmer.

SUBTITLE	You friend's a real charmer.

SUBTITLE	God is funny.

LUIS	(speaking foreign language) God is funny.  To send you to me.

SUBTITLE	To send you to me.

REVEREND	I don't understand.

LUIS	Let's just sit in the sun.  (speaking foreign language) I need to dry out a bit.

SUBTITLE	I need to dry out a bit.

LUIS	I'm gonna get out.  I saw a helicopter this morning.

REVEREND	Yeah?

LUIS	Uh-huh.  A police helicopter.  Maybe they were looking for somebody.  Who knows?  (speaking foreign language) (speaking English) that was a long way back.  You can talk to me.  I know it's difficult.  It's not easy, confession.  Let me show you.  (speaking foreign language) (speaking English) I'm an alcoholic.

REVEREND	That's no secret.

LUIS	(speaking foreign language) (speaking English) Okay.  Okay.  The thing is just I loved a woman and she loved me, but she had a husband, a family, and I am a religious man.  I never told that to anyone.  A new life awaits me where I'm going.  And it can be the same for you right here, right now, there's power in confession.

REVEREND	I don't believe in your religion.

LUIS	Religion has nothing to do with it.  Whatever you've done, they'll find you.

REVEREND	Get off of me.

LUIS	I'll have to tell them when I get to town, you know.  You'd do the same if you were me.

REVEREND	Don't come any closer.

LUIS	I want you to give yourself to God, unburden your soul.

REVEREND	Don't you come any fucking closer.

LUIS	I'm not (indistinct) to hold you.

REVEREND	Do you hear me?

LUIS	(speaking foreign language) (speaking English) You will…

REVEREND	Shut your mouth.

LUIS	…forever be free because whatever you've done, He already knows.  He knows.

REVEREND	Shut your fucking--shut your fucking…

LUIS	A new life awaits me where I'm going.  It can be the same for you.

POCO	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	What?

POCO	You're lost.

REVEREND	I'm looking for the church.

POCO	That way, padre.

MAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	So, you're here.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	No.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) (speaking English) Is this yours?  I hope it's okay.

REVEREND	It's fine.

CELIA	Do you have a suitcase or something?

REVEREND	In the van.

CELIA	You should get it.  It's not safe here at night.

REVEREND	I just wanna sleep.

CELIA	Okay.  Just don't forget your suitcase.

CELIA	I told you so.  I called the chief.

REVEREND	Chief?

CELIA	Yeah.  He's the one in charge.

CHIEF MOORE	All right.  My turn.  How you give a redneck circumcision?

DEPUTY GARCIA	How?

CHIEF MOORE	Kick his sister in the jaw.

REVEREND	I'm looking for the chief.

CHIEF MOORE	You found him.

REVEREND	My van was broken into last night.  Took everything I had.

CHIEF MOORE	You just passing through, I guess?

REVEREND	I'm here to work, actually.  At the church.

CHIEF MOORE	Hmm.  Start from the beginning.

REVEREND	Well, nothing much to tell.  I drove in late, parked in front of the church right where I'm staying and then fell asleep.

CHIEF MOORE	By yourself?

REVEREND	Did I sleep by myself?

CHIEF MOORE	I don't care who you sleep with, Reverend, I'm asking if you're traveling alone.

REVEREND	Yeah.

CHIEF MOORE	Did you see anybody on the way in or anybody see you?

REVEREND	Oh, there was a boy, Mexican.

CHIEF MOORE	Hmm.  We got a lot of those.
REVEREND	But young, and, and alone, late holding a tennis ball.

CHIEF MOORE	This kid, he about  years old?  And he had an older guy with him about , rough looking dude, tattoos, some chick on his arm?

REVEREND	Uh, I heard a voice, but I didn't see anyone.

CHIEF MOORE	Lurking in the shadows, probably waiting for a buyer.

REVEREND	So you know him?

CHIEF MOORE	I know everybody, except you, I guess.  Where are you from, Reverend?  Originally, where did you grow up?

REVEREND	Oh, Ohio.

CHIEF MOORE	Oh, yeah.  You ever lived in a tow like this?  A small town?  People think they got charm, you know.  Everybody knows everybody.  One bar, one grocery, one pizza joint.  The judge and the preacher, they share the same building, that kind of stuff.  And people think it's quiet.  Maybe it was.  Town like this, tight-knit, safe and quiet (indistinct) until they build the highway a few miles off, pull all the comers away and all the nice quiet folks along with it.  What's left?  Okay.  All I'm saying is this ain't Ohio.  Now we're here to help you, but you can help yourself an awful lot just by paying a little attention, okay?

REVEREND	Okay.

CHIEF MOORE	You should have Celia look at that hand.

REVEREND	Uh-hmm.  So, you know her too?

CHIEF MOORE	Like I said.

CHIEF MOORE	What's the plate number?

CHIEF MOORE	Reverend?

REVEREND	What?

CHIEF MOORE	The plate number of the van?

REVEREND	Oh, I don't know.

CHIEF MOORE	Would somebody get that, please?  Well, read this through, sign it at that bottom.  I'll have my boys get on it.  Just don't expect a miracle.  Hello, Bellville Police.  Yeah.  This is the chief.  No.  It's always like that.  I don't know.  I don't make the schedule.  Okay.  Sure.

VALENTIN	Poco, no.  (speaking foreign language) It's blood.

SUBTITLE	It's blood.

POCO	(speaking foreign language) Why is there blood?

SUBTITLE	Why is there blood?

VALENTIN	Who knows?  (speaking foreign language)

SUBTITLE	Fuckin' white dudes.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Fuckin' white dudes.  (speaking English) This shit is worth nothing.

POCO	Valentin, hey.

VALENTIN	Hmm.  Purple flowers are everywhere.

SUBTITLE	Not like these.  

POCO	(speaking foreign language) Not like these.  (speaking English) Do you think he was there?

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Stop messing around.

SUBTITLE	Stop messing around.

POLICE OFFICER	Valentin, are you in there? (speaking foreign language)

POCO	(speaking foreign language) I don't like going to the quarry.

SUBTITLE	I don't like going to the quarry.

VALENTIN	You like eating, don't you?

SUBTITLE	I get scared.

POCO	(speaking foreign language) I get scared.

VALENTIN)	(speaking foreign language)

POCO	(speaking foreign language) Hurry up, Valentin!

SUBTITLE	Hurry up, Valentin!

SUBTITLE	Chill out, Poco!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Chill out, Poco!

CELIA	You should stay just once.  It'll be nice.  I'll fix your breakfast in the morning.

CHIEF MOORE	I got to work.

CELIA	In the middle of the night?

CHIEF MOORE	That's when the bugs come out.

CELIA	Come on, John. 

SUBTITLE	Stay.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) Stay.

SUBTITLE	Don't beg.

CHIEF MOORE	(speaking foreign language) Don't beg.  (speaking English) It makes you look weak.  I didn't mean that.

CELIA	It's fine.  He knows you're here.  The walls are thin.  

CHIEF MOORE	You think he'll stay longer than the last one?

SUBTITLE	I don't really care how long he stays.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) I don't really care how long he stays.

CHIEF MOORE	I like your flowers.  

CELIA	They're fake.

CHIEF MOORE	See you.

CELIA	Nobody come.  Some but…

REVEREND	Hello?

CHIEF MOORE	Hope you're not expecting an answer.  I couldn't help it.  So, you got your first service.  You got your work cut out for you, huh?  Well, I wanted you to know I think I found your man or your boys, I guess.  With your case, your man, I'll be making an arrest soon.

CELIA	Who is it?

CHIEF MOORE	I think you know who it is.  Well, you act like it's my fault you come from criminals?  They're her cousins.  She's sensitive.

REVEREND	I should get ready for tonight.

CHIEF MOORE	Do I know you?

REVEREND	What do you mean?

CHIEF MOORE	Have we met somewhere before you come here?

REVEREND	Where would we have met?

CHIEF MOORE	I don't know.  That's why I'm asking.  I just feel like I've seen you before.

REVEREND	You spend much time in Ohio, Chief?

CHIEF MOORE	Yeah.  Have a good service, Reverend.  That is if anybody shows up.

REVEREND	Here's a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.  Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.  Chief.  I will read from the book of st Timothy Chapter .  I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that He considered me faithful, appointing me to His service.  Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance.  Do you understand me?  English?  What would you like to know?

WOMAN	Um, who are you?

REVEREND	I am a sinner.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

MAN	(speaking foreign language)

WOMAN	Why are you here?

REVEREND	Because the grace of our Lord was poured out on me.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

CELIA	I opened a bottle of wine.  I hope you don't mind.  He's not married.  I mean, he was but his wife died a few years ago.

REVEREND	It's none of my business.

CELIA	I've known a few preachers in my day.  You're not like any of them.

REVEREND	You mean I'm not Mexican?

CELIA	Besides that.

REVEREND	Well, I wasn't raised in the church.

CELIA	So, they haven't warned you down yet?  I came from Mexico with my uncle when I was a teenager to help him with the church.  I have been here ever since.

REVEREND	That's a long time.

CELIA	Yes, it is.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) The minister.

SUBTITLE	The minister.

POCO	No.  No!

VALENTIN	What?  What?  (speaking foreign language) It's a stupid robe.

SUBTITLE	It's a stupid robe.

VALENTIN	Where are the bloody clothes?

SUBTITLE	Where are the bloody clothes?

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Where are the bloody clothes?

SUBTITLE	The bloody clothes?

POCO	(speaking foreign language) The bloody clothes?

VALENTIN	The bloody clothes from the van.

POCO	(speaking foreign language) I don't know.

SUBTITLE	I don't know.

POCO	(speaking foreign language) You threw them?

SUBTITLE	You threw them?

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Go get them.

SUBTITLE	Go get them.

SUBTITLE	We have to burn them.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) We have to burn them.  Hurry, let's go!

SUBTITLE	Hurry, let's go!

SUBTITLE	Let's go, let's go!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Let's go, let's go!

POCO	(speaking foreign language) Run, Valentin!

SUBTITLE	Run, Valentin!

CHIEF MOORE	Garcia, you get Poco.  He went over there.  Come here, boy.

POLICE OFFICER	Get him.  Get him.  Get up here.  Get up.

CHIEF MOORE	I'm too damn old to be chasing you around the woods like a fucking teenager, boy.  Give me a break.  All right.  You go search the trailer.  I'm gonna take this little dipshit down to the station.  Come on.  Garcia!

GARCIA	(speaking foreign language) I lost him, Chief.

SUBTITLE	I lost him, Chief.

CHIEF MOORE	Well, put out the damn fire then.

POLICE OFFICER	Oh, shit.

CELIA	(singing foreign language) I will rise and go to Jesus.

SUBTITLE	I will rise and go to Jesus.

CELIA	(singing foreign language) He will take me in His arms.

SUBTITLE	He will take me in His arms.

SUBTITLE	In the arms of my dear Savior,

CELIA	(singing foreign language) In the arms of my dear Savior.  O, there are ten thousand charms.

SUBTITLE	O, there are ten thousand charms…

CELIA	(speaking English) Yeah?

REVEREND	I can't sleep.  I heard you singing.

CELIA	You're lonely.  Like all the others.

REVEREND	That's not what I came.  I came to apologize.  I didn't mean to cause trouble.  Your cousin.

CELIA	They stole your property.  They must be held accountable.

REVEREND	Are you close to them?

CELIA	No.

REVEREND	But the song that you're singing, is it--uh, was it like a Mexican hymn?

CELIA	My uncle wouldn't let us sing Mexican hymns, just American.  To fit in, you know?  And none of us spoke much English so we just sang the words in Spanish.  That's why none of them rhyme.

REVEREND	Well, it sounded nice.  I should let you rest.

CELIA	You're really not like the others.  I have a lot of pain in my heart, Reverend.  And I'm proud of it.

REVEREND	Do you, um--do you need to be forgiven?

CELIA	You're not the one who can forgive.  Good night.

CHIEF MOORE	Is this yours, Reverend?

REVEREND	Yeah.

CHIEF MOORE	Well, put some clothes on and come with me.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Give me a cigarette, Chief.

SUBTITLE	Give me a cigarette, Chie

CHIEF MOORE	Oh, you know me.  I don't smoke, cabron.  The night you got to town, the boy you saw, this is his brother.  Blanco!  This a-hole uses a pre-teen to push his dope, can you believe that?  Anyhow, this is not you want to see.  Well, theft is one thing, Valentin.  Destroying evidence is another.  Of course, if I were you, I would've started with this.  Whose blood is that?  Tell me it's yours.  Please don't say it belongs to some pothead that pissed you off.

VALENTIN	It's his.

CHIEF MOORE	Who?

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language)

CHIEF MOORE	(speaking foreign language) (speaking English) No shit?

VALENTIN	It's true.

CHIEF MOORE	Yeah, we found these clothes in your trailer, dickhead, and not in his boxes.  Now, here's how I see it.  I think somebody stepped to you when you were robbing that van and shit got out of hand.  That tells me where you got a victim somewhere.  Either dead or extremely fucking injured.  Am I right?  Uh-hmm.  It's what I thought.  Come on.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) (speaking English) A lot of purple flowers.  Why were you at the quarry?

CHIEF MOORE	Sorry, there ain't more.  They burned the rest before we found them.  You sign this here and you can take what's left.  No luck on the tires, sorry.  But there's an auto store out on the highway.

REVEREND	I can't afford new tires.

CHIEF MOORE	Not getting rich off of the collection plate, huh?  Maybe you should watch some TV preachers get some tips.  You're not a big smiler, aren't you?  That's cool.

REVEREND	What happens now?  Him?

CHIEF MOORE	He'll stay here until the next circuit court.  We do wanna know who's in the church every couple of months.  We'll find his brother in the meantime.

REVEREND	It's just some clothes to me.  Just stuff.  There's no big deal, really.

CHIEF MOORE	Breaking the law ain't a big deal?

REVEREND	I just don't think it's worth the trouble, that's all.

CHIEF MOORE	Look, I know what you're doing.  Turn the other cheek, second chances, forgiveness.  I get it.  But here's the problem, Reverend.  Forgiveness only works in a world where people learn their lessons, but they don't, not here anyway.

REVEREND	Thank you for finding my stuff.

CHIEF MOORE	Blanco.

REVEREND	But now a righteousness from God, which is apart from law, has been made known.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	This righteousness from God comes from through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	There is no difference.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	So we are made right with God through faith in Jesus.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	Not by obeying the law.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

MAN	(speaking foreign language)

WOMAN	We have not been spoken to the way that you speak to us, without judgment.

REVEREND	I just say the words.  It's not me that you are here for.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	It's the words.  It's the book.  I, I don't know what I say.

SUBTITLE	I give myself to you, Lord.

ROSARIO	(speaking foreign language) I give myself to you, Lord.

SUBTITLE	Because I am hopeless…

ROSARIO	(speaking foreign language) Because I am hopeless.

SUBTITLE	And because I have failed.

ROSARIO	(speaking foreign language) And because I have failed.

SUBTITLE	I am the dirt.

ROSARIO	(speaking foreign language) I am the dirt.

SUBTITLE	I am lower than low.

ROSARIO	(speaking foreign language) I am lower than low.

SUBTITLE	I am beyond hope

ROSARIO	(speaking foreign language) I am beyond hope…

SUBTITLE	in the eyes of man.

ROSARIO	(speaking foreign language) …in the eyes of man.  (speaking foreign language)

WOMAN	Rosario has something she would like to ask you, Reverend.

ROSARIO	(speaking foreign language)

WOMAN	She wants to be baptized.

CHIEF MOORE	Uh, it's funny in this room.  The world don't look the same from in here.  Now, you don't wanna be here, do you?  Sleeping on the floor wearing dirty clothes, eating shit I want to feed the dog.  Three days now.  Don't you wanna be somewhere comfortable?

VALENTIN	I want to be home.

CHIEF MOORE	Well then, help me out.  Speak a little truth.  You got a hideout in the woods somewhere or a tent, something like that?  (speaking foreign language) Poco?  (speaking English) He's a little kid, man.  He's out there by himself right now probably scared to death.  He'd be safer here with us.  And then, Valentin, my boys went back out at your place yesterday, found quite a stash.  Breaking into cars, growing weed.  You got yourself quite a little criminal enterprise, don't' you?  Where do you grow it?  Hey, where does this come from?

SUBTITLE	Why don't you ask the Reverend?

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Why don't you ask the Reverend?

CHIEF MOORE	You write your name on the wall yet?

SUBTITLE	Where is he going?

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Where is he going?

CHIEF MOORE	Don't worry about him.  Come on now.  It's a tradition.  Don't want me to forget you, do you?

VALENTIN	Hey, where are you going?

CHIEF MOORE	Not far.  You remember where your crop is, I'll come right on back.  You see Poco around?

CELIA	(scoffs)

SUBTITLE	My family of criminals?

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) My family of criminals?

CHIEF MOORE	Hey.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said that.  I mean, the little one, he's got no choice.  But I got some questions for him.

CELIA	Nope.  I haven't seen them.

CHIEF MOORE	Yeah.  I see how you watch out for him even from a distance more than his mom had ever did.  Now, did he say anything?  You know where he was going?

CELIA	John, I don't know.  I told you.

CHIEF MOORE	All right.  Sorry.

CELIA	He's with Valentin.  He always is.

CHIEF MOORE	Not today, unless he's hiding in that cell.

CELIA	What do you mean?

POLICE OFFICER	Chief.  Valentin, you remember.

SUBTITLE	Valentin…

POCO	(speaking foreign language) Valentin.

SUBTITLE	Dummy…

POCO	(speaking foreign language) Dummy.

SUBTITLE	Always in trouble.

POCO	(speaking foreign language) Always in trouble.

SUBTITLE	I have to fix your mess.

POCO	(speaking foreign language) I have to fix your mess.

WOMAN	Reverend.

REVEREND	When we were baptized into union with Christ Jesus.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	We were baptized into union with his death.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	We were buried with him and shared his death.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	So that we might also be raised, live a new life.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	A new life.

POCO	Damn.

CHIEF MOORE	Poco.

CHIEF MOORE	Jesus.

POCO	Get off of me!

CHIEF MOORE	Hush up.

POCO	(grunts) Get off!

CHIEF MOORE	I said hush up.  Same lines, all the same lines.

SUBTITLE	He was there!

POCO	(speaking foreign language) He was there!

SUBTITLE	Fuck you!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Fuck you!

CHIEF MOORE	I didn't mean to do that.

SUBTITLE	Asshole!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Asshole!

SUBTITLE (MAN)	Calm down!

POLICE OFFICER:	(speaking foreign language) Calm down.

CHIEF MOORE	Get something to bandage the boy.

SUBTITLE	Look at this!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Look at this.  (speaking English) You do this to a boy for some fucking pot?

CHIEF MOORE	Oh, no.  No, no.  Pots are the least of your worries now.  We found a body, a dead body.

VALENTIN	In the Quarry?

CHIEF MOORE	That's right.

VALENTIN	With purple flowers all around.

CHIEF MOORE	Yeah?

VALENTIN	I know this because we stole his boxes, his clothes.  The flowers were inside.  Yeah.  That's what he told you.  Yeah.  Our stories match.

CHIEF MOORE	Matching stories ain't hard to do.

VALENTIN	I killed no man.

SUBTITLE	Look into the new man's eyes

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Look into the new man's eyes…

SUBTITLE	and ask him about the quarry.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) …and ask him about the quarry.

SUBTITLE	They will not look like mine.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) They will not look like mine.  (speaking English) Truth, Chief.

REVEREND	And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write these words."

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	"Blessed are the dead, who will from now on die in the Lord."

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	"Yes," says the spirit.  "They will rest from their labors for their deeds follow them wherever they go."

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)
CHIEF MOORE	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	I know you were here today because of a man.

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	Did anyone know him?

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	If anyone would like to say anything?

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

MAN	(speaking foreign language)

WOMAN	He wants you to pray.

REVEREND	Pray?  Yes.  Our Father…

WOMAN	(speaking foreign language)

ALL	(speaking foreign language) (speaking English) Amen.

CHIEF MOORE	That's the most folks I've seen in this building in a long time.  Well, you must be the real deal.  I guess you heard what we found out at the quarry.

REVEREND	Everybody heard.

CHIEF MOORE	Hmm.  But I got him.

REVEREND	I heard that too.

CHIEF MOORE	The wolves beat us to him though, or dogs, some kind of animal.  Gnawed the flesh off his body.  Plucked out his eyes.  Ate his tongue.  But, you know how it adds up, the evidence, bloody clothes, and all that.  Guy must've snuck up on him after their stash.  He surprised them.  They panicked.  And then instinct, the lizard brain.

REVEREND	Who was he?

CHIEF MOORE	Yeah.  We didn't find an ID.  Probably just another illegal.  More of them around here than you can imagine, more coming every day.  Kind of what I was expecting with you, to be honest.

REVEREND	You thought I'd be an illegal?

CHIEF MOORE	A minority.

REVEREND	We're all minorities now, right?  This part of the country?

CHIEF MOORE	Last I checked, I was white.  Jesus made things too easy.  Forgiven us, all you got to do is ask.  Nobody's got to be responsible for what they've done.  My daddy wore this badge  years.  It was a good job back then.  You get to help people, you know.  He was like the mayor.  People waved to him when he walked into town on Sunday afternoon.  They were glad to see him.  I always thought that was cool.  Wanted that for myself when I grew up.  But it ain't cool.  And nobody's ever glad to see me.  All I do is run around sweeping mud off the streets.

REVEREND	What's that got to do with forgiveness?

CHIEF MOORE	Well, it's hard to stay clean when everything you touch is dirty.  They're saying things about you, Reverend.  The boys in that cell.

REVEREND	Well, people say anything to save themselves.

CHIEF MOORE	The body, it needs to be buried.

REVEREND	So soon?

CHIEF MOORE	Yeah.  We got the fingerprints and all that, the official stuff.  Nothing's gonna come off it.  That's the risk you take crossing over.  But the poor bastard took blunt trauma to the skull.  The least we can do is give him some restful peace.  Will you do it?

REVEREND	It's my job.  Say, you're wife.  Is that how she died?  Was it a Mexican?

CHIEF MOORE	No.  She lost control of her car out on Highway .  It was raining.  She got T-boned by a semi.  Never knew what hit her.

SUBTITLE	I brought you…

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) I brought you…

SUBTITLE	Your brother needs it.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) Your brother needs it.

SUBTITLE	Valentin, don't be a fool.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) Valentin, don't be a fool.

SUBTITLE	I can take care of him.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) I can take care of him.

CELIA	(giggles)

CELIA	No.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language)

SUBTITLE	Not in here you can't.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) Not in here you can't.

SUBTITLE	Suddenly we matter to you?

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Suddenly we matter to you?

SUBTITLE	You call me a fool

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) You call me a fool…

SUBTITLE	but you live in a house of lies.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) …but you live in a house of lies.

SUBTITLE	You deserve each other.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) You deserve each other.

SUBTITLE	A liar in bed with a liar.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) A liar in bed with a liar.

SUBTITLE	Shut up!

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) Shut up!	

SUBTITLE	John is a good man.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) John is a good man.

SUBTITLE	He has a good heart.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) He has a good heart.

SUBTITLE	He will find the truth.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) He will find the truth.

SUBTITLE	He will be just.  You'll see.

CELIA	(speaking foreign language) He will be just.  You'll see.

SUBTITLE	I'm not talking about the Chief.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) I'm not talking about the Chief.

CHIEF MOORE	My daddy used to say, "You wanna catch a killer, you go to the funeral.  Look for anyone there who shouldn't be.  That's your man."  Nobody here today though, except Jonas.  Hey, Jonas.  You killed this guy?  That's what I thought.  Go ahead.

REVEREND	I'll, uh, I'll just read a verse.  In the place of the dead, there's excitement over your arrival.  The spirits of world leaders and mighty kings long dead, stand up to see you.  Everyone there will stare at you and ask, "Can this be the one who shook the earth and made the kingdoms of the world tremble? Is this the one who destroyed the world and made it into a waste land?  Is this the king who demolished the world's greatest cities and had no mercy on his prisoners?"  And with one voice they will all cry out, "Rejoice."  For now, you are as weak as we are.

CHIEF MOORE	That's a weird fucking verse.

REVEREND	Amen.

MAN	(sighs)

MAN	Can't help you, unless you talk.

VALENTIN	I've been here days.  Days.

MAN	Listen, I'm the only public defender in a three-county area.  That's a lot of people, okay?  Now, I'm sorry you've been waiting here longer than you cared to, but that's just the way it is.  Things take time.

VALENTIN	Not take time, if we were white.

MAN	Takes time if you're white or black, or pink and purple polka dots.

VALENTIN	The policeman hates us.  Hates our skin.

MAN	Policeman hates criminals.  Are you a criminal?

VALENTIN	I'll never get a fair trial.  Not with a white lawyer.

MAN	You watch too much damn TV.  I had a cousin married to a Latina.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language)

MAN	What?

VALENTIN	Leave.

MAN	These are some serious charges, huh.  It's drugs today but they tell me it's soon to be murder.  You'd be wise to swallow some of that pride and accept the help of the state.  You're a young man.  You got some life yet to live.  And your little brother back there, he ain't hardly lived his life yet at all.  Do yourself a favor and think about, all right?  (speaking foreign language)

CHIEF MOORE	I'm sorry.

CELIA	For what?

CHIEF MOORE	Plenty of things, I'm sure.  These are real.  This is kind of a weird question, but do you remember what this bandage looked like?  The night he came to town, he had a, a bandage on his hand, you remember what it looked like?

CELIA	Yeah.  It was bloody.

CHIEF MOORE	But was it like a, a bandana or a piece of cloth or maybe a sleeve?

CELIA	A sleeve.

CHIEF MOORE	I just wondered if you remember.

CELIA	That's a weird detail to worry about.

CHIEF MOORE	Well, no detail is too small.  I have to study the clues with great care and intension.  Using a delicate touch with force when necessary.

POLICE OFFICER	Yo, Chief, come quick.

CHIEF MOORE	What is it?

POLICE OFFICER	You wouldn't believe if I told you.  Come on.

CHIEF MOORE	Pardon my Espanol, Reverend, but you look like shit.  Well, it's not to cheer you up.  He confessed, Valentin, to the man dope, the dead man, all of it.

REVEREND	Why would he confess?

CHIEF MOORE	Because he did it and he's in a cage.

REVEREND	And his brother?
CHIEF MOORE	Valentin swears he acted alone.  Probably not true, of course, but at this point, it's a deal I can take.  I'm gonna need a statement from you, in court, testimony about the man and all, it won't be much.

REVEREND	Uh-hmm.

CHIEF MOORE	Guilt's a heavy burden, ain't it, Reverend?  Most men can't carry it alone.  Feel better.

LUIS	It's over now.  How does that feel?  If you can just sail away.

POLICE OFFICER	You have five minutes.

REVEREND	Thank you.  They will hang you.

VALENTIN	Better only me than my brother, too.

REVEREND	Let me pray with you.

VALENTIN	What do you wanna pray for?  For this?  For Poco?

REVEREND	Listen to me, whatever you've done, whatever put you in here.

VALENTIN	You put me in here!  Tell me your name.

REVEREND	Please just, just pray with me.

VALENTIN	Tell me your name.

REVEREND	I'm father…

SUBTITLE	Liar!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Liar!  (speaking English) You are no preacher.  (speaking foreign language)

REVEREND	Oh, Father, we pray to you…

VALENTIN	No!  (speaking foreign language) God does not hear your words!

SUBTITLE	God does not hear your words!

REVEREND	We ask for your forgiveness, Father.

SUBTITLE	Shut up!  It is a lie!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Shut up!  It is a lie.

REVEREND	Have mercy.

SUBTITLE	It's a lie!  Fucking asshole!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) It's a lie!  Fucking asshole!

SUBTITLE	Shut up!  Liar!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Shut up!  Liar!

REVEREND	Listen to me.  Just to me!

POLICE OFFICER	Get back.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Liar!  Liar!

SUBTITLE	Liar!  Liar!

VALENTIN	You are no man of God.

SUBTITLE	You will burn in hell asshole!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) You will burn in hell asshole!

SUBTITLE	There is nothing you can do to make this right.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) There is nothing you can do to make this right.  You will burn!

SUBTITLE	You will burn!

POLICE OFFICER	Just shut it down!

SUBTITLE	I will see you there!

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) I will see you there!

LUIS	Right here, right now.  Just bow in confession.

JUDGE	Call the first witness.

CHIEF MOORE	Put right hand on the Bible and your left hand in the air.  Do you swear to tell the truth and the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God?

REVEREND	I do.

CHIEF MOORE	Hmm.  State your name for the record.  State your name for the record, please.  Are you David Martin?  Are you the Reverend David Martin?

REVEREND	I'm sorry, sorry, Your Honor.  I'm sorry.  Your Honor, um, I haven't been feeling, um, well lately.

JUDGE	Are you able to continue?

REVEREND	Uh-hmm.

CHIEF MOORE	All right.  One last time, state your name for the record.

REVEREND	My name is David Martin, reverend of Town Church.

CHIEF MOORE	Thank you, Reverend.

SUBTITLE	Go with her.

VALENTIN	(speaking foreign language) Go with her.

CHIEF MOORE	Now please tell the court what happened the night you arrived in town.

REVEREND	We, uh, parked my van at the church and, um, and I met the…

POLICE OFFICER	Hey, hey, stop!

WOMAN	Poco!  Poco!

CHIEF MOORE	Hey, stop!  Hey, I said stop!

POLICE OFFICER	Hey, Chief, where did he go?

CHIEF MOORE	I don't know, in here somewhere.

POLICE OFFICER	He might be heading to the river.

CHIEF MOORE	But he ain't leaving without his brother.  We must be sure we find him first.  You hear me?  I'mma find your brother.  I'll find him!  Oh, shit.  Oh, God. Celia, you in here?

REVEREND)	(sobs)

VALENTIN	(snores)

VALENTIN	(pants)

VALENTIN	What is your name?

REVEREND	It doesn't matter.  My name is sinner.  I murdered my wife and her lover.  I caught them.  I murdered David Martin, the body (indistinct) I took everything from him.  Please forgive me.  Please forgive me.  Please forgive me, forgive me, forgive me.  Forgive me, forgive me.  Forgive me.  Can you forgive me?  Forgive me.

VALENTIN)	(grunts)	

REVEREND)	(groans)

VALENTIN	I won't forget and forgive.

VALENTIN	(grunts)

REVEREND	(groans)

REVEREND	You ever think of leaving?

CELIA	What do you mean, like running away?

REVEREND	Like making a new start, leaving the past behind?

CELIA	Sure.  Just catch a dream bound for paradise.

REVEREND	Why not?

CELIA	(speaks foreign language) The past is always with you.

SUBTITLE	The past is always with you.

REVEREND	What's that mean?

CELIA	(singing foreign language)
