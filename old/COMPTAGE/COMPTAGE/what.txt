DOCTOR	there’s a chance we might have been able to save her.

TERRENCE	She knew the risks. 

TERRENCE	She knew you wouldn’t report her.

DOCTOR	And the father?

TERRENCE	Who knows?

TERRENCE	My daughter. 

TERRENCE	We haven’t spoken in years.

MOTHER	My baby!

SUNDAY	Can I have that one?

EDDIE	What happens to a dream deferred? 

EDDIE	Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?

EDDIE	Or fester, like a sore then run.

EDDIE	Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.

EDDIE	or does it explode?

SUNDAY	I like it. Did you write that?

EDDIE	No, ma’am. That’s the great Langston Hughes, jazz king of Harlem. 

EDDIE	Haven’t I already told you that?

SUNDAY	Must have slipped my mind. 

EDDIE	Tell me, Miss Settman.

EDDIE	What’s your secret? Last night…

EDDIE	You’re puking in the planter but today you’re looking fresh as a daisy.

SATURDAY	Dinner is served. 

MONDAY	That’s interesting. Spread sheets for tomorrow. 

WEDNESDAY	I’m starving.

SATURDAY	You always are. I think you might have worms. 

SUNDAY	Oh, come on, Saturday.

WEDNESDAY	Let’s hope I have worms. We can cook them next week. 

THURSDAY	Ooh, it’s gross. 

WEDNESDAY	It’s delicious.

TUESDAY	It’s kind of beautiful.

THURSDAY	It’s a fucking rat!

FRIDAY	It’s actually quite good.

WEDNESDAY	At least it tastes like something.

WEDNESDAY	Unlike that engineered shit you’re eating. 

SATURDAY	Oh come on, Wednesday, you’d eat anything.

SATURDAY	Deep fried pig dick on a stick!

SATURDAY	You buy it and you eat it. 

SUNDAY	You okay?

MONDAY	I’m fine.

SUNDAY	You seem…	

MONDAY	I know. It’s just…my big presentation is tomorrow. 

SATURDAY	You mean our presentation. 

MONDAY	No thanks to you getting shitfaced last night.

SUNDAY	Yeah, Eddie said you’d dropped in the planter. 

SUNDAY	I didn’t know what to say. I felt really embarrassed. 

SATURDAY	I was entertaining one of our clients. 

SATURDAY	I might have overdone it on the martinis.

SATURDAY	Shoot me. 

MONDAY	You have to tell us everything, Saturday. 

MONDAY	How can you be so stupid?

MONDAY	I’m just tired. 

MONDAY	Tomorrow’s a big day. 

THURSDAY	If we get this promotion, it’s all thanks to Friday.

THURSDAY	She makes us all look like a genius.

FRIDAY	It’s a team effort. 

FRIDAY	You guys did the legwork. I just crunch numbers. 

SUNDAY	Seven minds are better than one. 

TERRENCE	You must work collectively.

TERRENCE	You’re stronger together than you are alone. 

TERRENCE	In time, we will select a career that capitalizes on your joint skills. 

TERRENCE	What are you waiting for? Go on.

TERRENCE	Go on. Solve the problem. 

TERRENCE	May I see?

TERRENCE	Very good. 

TERRENCE	Go, Go. Go. Go. 

TERRENCE	Pay attention girls. 

TERRENCE	Tomorrow is a big day. 

TERRENCE	You know how there are seven days in the week. 

TERRENCE	Well, starting tomorrow, 

TERRENCE	you will each get to go outside on the day of the week that is your name. 

TERRENCE	That means Sunday will get to go outside on Sunday, 

TERRENCE	Monday on Monday, Tuesday on Tuesday and so on. 

TERRENCE	In here, I want you to be…

TERRENCE	who you are, dress the way you wish.

TERRENCE	I want you to be creative and express yourself. 

TERRENCE	But outside of these walls, you will all take on the singular identity 

TERRENCE	of Karen Settman. Named after your mother. 

THURSDAY	Can I play outside?

TERRENCE	Yes, you can. As long as it’s your day.

TERRENCE	But you can never go outside together at the same time.

TERRENCE	Ever. Even with your bracelet. 

TERRENCE	And wherever you are and whatever you’re doing, you can never…

TERRENCE	tell a soul that you’re a sibling. That’s very important. 

TERRENCE	You understand?

TERRENCE	Okay. 

TERRENCE	Well, we begin tomorrow. 

TERRENCE	Starting with you, Thursday.

TERRENCE	You ready to do this?

TERRENCE	Okay. 

WOMAN	For your safety and security…

WOMAN	have your bags out for inspection.

WOMAN	(words indistinct)

WOMAN	Have your wristband ready for inspection.

WOMAN	No unauthorized persons allowed to enter the sector.

TERRENCE	Don’t forget. You’re the one and only Karen Settman. 

TERRENCE	The end of the day meeting is the most important part of your day.

TERRENCE	It’s the time to share every detail with your siblings. 

TERRENCE	Okay?

TUESDAY	Oh god.

SUNDAY	Poor kid. Straight to the Cryobank.

FRIDAY	With Cayman running for Parliament, security’s getting tighter

WEDNESDAY	I fucking hate that bitch. 

THURSDAY	I don’t know. Maybe Cryosleep isn’t such a bad idea.

THURSDAY	We turn ourselves in, get frozen, play sleeping beauty until the population drops. 

TUESDAY	I heard you still dream like horrible nightmares for hundreds of years. 

SUNDAY	By the time you wake up everyone you know and love would be gone. 

THURSDAY	Well, we go to sleep together, wake up together.

THURSDAY	The Child Allocation Act will be a thing of the past and…

THURSDAY	we can finally live our own lives 

MONDAY	Are we really going to have this conversation again?

MONDAY	Why can’t you accept that this is your family?

THURSDAY	This isn’t a family. It’s a repressive regime.

MONDAY	I didn’t pick this life any more than you did. 

THURSDAY	Yet you live it so perfectly. 

THURSDAY	Karen Settman from cradle to grave. It’s disgusting.

MONDAY	What do you care? 

MONDAY	Your only ambition was to be a total loser, which you are. 

THURSDAY	Fuck you, Monday. 

THURSDAY	Just because I have my own personality and dreams 

THURSDAY	and want to have a relationship…

THURSDAY	that is more than just a random fuck with someone that I’ll never see again.

THURSDAY	I’m sick to death of Miss Karen Fucking Settman. 

MONDAY	Karen Settman is the foundation we built our lives on. 

THURSDAY	No. She’s a mask.

THURSDAY	A mask we put on one day a week.

THURSDAY	One day a week we can go out in the…

THURSDAY	real world and we can’t even be ourselves. 

THURSDAY	We have to be a fake person.

WEDNESDAY	Oh shut up, both of you!

WEDNESDAY	You’re driving us all crazy. 

SATURDAY	This is our life. It is what it is.

THURSDAY	Being trapped in this prison six days a week isn’t a life. 

THURSDAY	It’s a slow, agonizing soul-sucking death.

TERRENCE	Saturday, let’s go. Or you’ll be late for your recital. 

TERRENCE	So you didn’t see her leave 

TERRENCE	and you don’t have any idea where she might be.

TERRENCE	Well.

TERRENCE	When did you see her last?

THURSDAY	I was just skating and I fell. 

TERRENCE	Oh Thursday. 

TERRENCE	What if the Bureau caught you?

TERRENCE	One mistake is all it takes to put all your lives at risk. 

THURSDAY	I hate Karen Settman.

THURSDAY	I wish that I’d never been born.

TERRENCE	Enough! 

TERRENCE	Do you want to get taken away?

TERRENCE	Get frozen for all eternity in that god-awful machine

TERRENCE	and never see me or your sisters again?

TERRENCE	Go.

TERRENCE	Monday.

TERRENCE	I warned you.

TERRENCE	Everything you do affects each other. 

MONDAY	What’s that for?

TERRENCE	Keep still. 

MONDAY	(WINCING)

TERRENCE	What happens to one of you, happens to you all. 

TERRENCE	Now Monday.

TERRENCE	I need you to be brave.

TERRENCE	Set an example for your sisters. 

MONDAY	Will it hurt?

TERRENCE	Yes. 

TERRENCE	Don’t move. 

SATURDAY	What’s your name better going down. 

MONDAY	Shut up. 

SUNDAY	You’re burning up. You running a fever?

MONDAY	No.

SUNDAY	You sure?

MONDAY	I’m fine. 

SUNDAY	Maybe you should switch days. 

SATURDAY	I can do Mondays. 

SATURDAY	Success doesn’t come without sacrifice and struggle. 

MONDAY	Shut the fuck up. 

EDDIE	Beneath the tall tree while night comes on gently. 

MONDAY	Langston Hughes again, Eddie. 

MONDAY	You sound like a broken record. 

EDDIE	And a good day to you, too. 

ADRIAN		Someone’s in a rush, huh?

MONDAY	Big day at work. 

ADRIAN	These lines are getting worse

ADRIAN	Last week a woman gave birth right here because she couldn’t get through.

MONDAY	No kidding.

ADRIAN	Of course it had to happen on my day. 

ADRIAN	Monday’s are the worst. I hate checkpoint duty. 

ADRIAN	Except I get to see you.

ADRIAN	I’m afraid I have ask you a couple of questions.

ADRIAN	The Bureau’s a stickler for protocol. You understand

ADRIAN	What’s your name?

MONDAY	Karen Settman. 

ADRIAN	Karen, do you have any siblings?

MONDAY	No. 

ADRIAN	You carrying any contraband?

MONDAY	No.

ADRIAN	Are you sure? Do I have to body search you?

ADRIAN	You may proceed. 

JERRY	Karen. 

MONDAY	Jerry.

JERRY	So today’s the big day, huh. 

JERRY	We’ll see who gets the promotion. 

JERRY	All these years I’ve been trying to figure out your angle.

JERRY	I always thought with a body like that you’d fuck your way to the top. 

JERRY	But then it turns out you’re a frigid bitch. 

MONDAY	Just because I find you repulsive.

JERRY	You’re not interested in anyone. 

JERRY	Working here, night after night, like a fucking robot. 

JERRY	You think you’ve got us all fooled, don’t you?

MONDAY	I have no idea what you’re talking about. 

JERRY	Yes, you do. 

JERRY	Karen.

JERRY	I’m on to you. 

SATURDAY	Where the hell is she?

THURSDAY	Did you try her again?
 
SUNDAY	Yeah. Straight to voicemail. 

WEDNESDAY	Maybe she got held up. 

TUESDAY	She would have called. 

THURSDAY	Ping her bracelet. 

FRIDAY	That’s weird.

THURSDAY	What?

FRIDAY	Her GPS locator is off. 

FRIDAY	She’s not showing up on the grid. 

WEDNESDAY	She can’t just vanish. 

SATURDAY	Oh yes, you can. If you want to. 

TUESDAY	Maybe she was in an accident. 

THURSDAY	Run a search. Hospitals. Police records.

TUESDAY	What if Monday’s hurt? Or dead.

TUESDAY	And the authorities find her before we do. 

TUESDAY	Then Karen Settman no longer exists. 

TUESDAY	Then our lives are over. 

SATURDAY	Jeez. She’s only a few minutes late.

THURSDAY	Monday’s never been late for an end of the day meeting. 

THURSDAY	Ever.

TUESDAY	(SIGHING)

SATURDAY	Eyes bloodshot from excessive drug use…

SATURDAY	and emotional distress. 

SATURDAY	Dark circles under the eyes.

TUESDAY	Oh.

SATURDAY	Stay still.

THURSDAY	Really? Pot brownie?

TUESDAY	It’s medicinal. You know it’s good for my nerves. 

TUESDAY	(SIGHING) I have a bad feeling about this. 

TUESDAY	Remember what happened the last time two of us were out there at once. 

TUESDAY	That was bad. 

THURSDAY	We’ve got to figure out where Monday is. 

THURSDAY	You got to act as if everything is normal. 

TUESDAY	Easy for you to say. It’s not your day.

TUESDAY	What if we’ve been listed?

THURSDAY	Listen to me. If Karen Settman had been listed, 

THURSDAY	the Bureau would have kicked in the door

THURSDAY	and we all would have been processed by now. 

FRIDAY	Well…

FRIDAY	technically speaking, one of us would get to live. 

EDDIE	Good morning, Miss Settman. 

TUESDAY	Good morning, Eddie. 

EDDIE	I didn’t see you come home yesterday.

TUESDAY	After hours. Let myself in. 

FRIDAY	She’s through. 

TUESDAY	So we got our promotion. 

THURSDAY	Stay focused, Tuesday.

THURSDAY	Check the calendar, desktop. Anything that might give us a clue. 

VICTORIA	I’ve got the brief for your conference call. 

TUESDAY	Vicky, when was the last time you synched my tablet?

VICTORIA	9:03 this morning. 

VICTORIA	Why?

TUESDAY	I forgot to log out last night. 

VICTORIA	You left early to celebrate.

TUESDAY	Yes, of course. Um, 

TUESDAY	where did I go again?

VICTORIA	Your favorite bar. Harry’s. 
TUESDAY	Yes, of course. Harry’s. Thanks. (CHUCKLES)

VICTORIA	You’re welcome. 

MIA	Cheers.

TUESDAY	Cheers.

TUESDAY	Last night, do you remember what time I left?

MIA	You only stayed for one drink. You barely touched it. 

MIA	I think that colleague of yours put you off. 

TUESDAY	Yeah. God, yeah. We were…

TUESDAY	which one of them?

MIA	You know that douchebag in the suspenders.

MIA	Jerry, I think?

TUESDAY	Yeah.
TUESDAY	Monday and Jerry argued just before she left the bar. 

SATURDAY	He’s on to us. I knew it. 

WEDNESDAY	Fucking dick sold us out. 

THURSDAY	Then why aren’t we listed?

THURSDAY	You’ve got to corner him, Tuesday. 

THURSDAY	Find out what he knows. 

TUESDAY	Are you nuts?

THURSDAY	He could be the last person who saw Monday. 

THURSDAY	He’s out only lead. 

TUESDAY	Yeah, okay. 

ZAQUIA	Miss Settman. 

TUESDAY	Yes?

ZAQUIA	Step into the van, please. 

TUESDAY	Is there a problem?

TUESDAY	I don’t understand. Who are you?

JOE	Step into the fucking van. 

FRIDAY	That’s weird. I lost her.

TUESDAY	There’s obviously been a mistake. 

TUESDAY	Can you please tell me what I’m doing here?

CAYMAN	Miss Settman. 

CAYMAN	What a pleasure to meet you. 

CAYMAN	Nicolette Cayman. 

TUESDAY	I know who you are. 

TUESDAY	Can you please tell me why I’m here?

CAYMAN	You poor child. 

CAYMAN	I am amazed you made it this far. 

TUESDAY	This is…this is all a big mistake.

CAYMAN	Seven children. 

CAYMAN	What was your grandfather thinking?

CAYMAN	Do you have any idea how much food and water 

CAYMAN	was taken out of others’ mouths so you could be here today?

CAYMAN	If everyone were as cruel and selfish as Terrence Settman, 

CAYMAN	the world would end tomorrow. 

TUESDAY	I am an only child. 

CAYMAN	For your sake, I wish that were true. 

JOE	There are five of them left. 

JOE	All the rotten eggs in one basket

CAYMAN	Is there another way?

JOE	Not if you want to keep it quiet. 

TUESDAY	Wha…What are you doing?

TUESDAY	I work in a bank. I can get you money. Please. 

TUESDAY	Please. We can make some kind of deal. Please. 

CAYMAN	Funny.

CAYMAN	That’s what the last one said. 

TUESDAY	No, wait. Wait. No, please. No. 

TUESDAY	No. No. No. No. No.

SATURDAY	I can’t believe this is happening. 

WEDNESDAY	We can’t just sit here.

WEDNESDAY	We got to help her. We got to go out there. 

WEDNESDAY	We gotta do something!

SUNDAY	Thursday…

SUNDAY	Oh my god. 

EDDIE	Residents or visitors?

DUTCH	Visitors.

DUTCH	Step out. 

DUTCH	All of you. 

DUTCH	Now!

DUTCH	That’s it. Nice and slow. 

DUTCH	Nice and slow. 

DUTCH	This way. 

DUTCH	Look at them. Hiding like rats. 

DUTCH	So…

DUTCH	Where’s the last one?

SATURDAY	Fuck you.

DUTCH	You fucking cunt!

DUTCH	Fucking…ahh!

SUNDAY	Is it bad?

THURSDAY	It’s okay. Look at me. 

SUNDAY	I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die. 

THURSDAY	You’re going to be okay. 

THURSDAY	I’m here. Okay?

SUNDAY	I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. 

THURSDAY	No. You’re Sunday. 

THURSDAY	You’re supposed to be the believer. 

SUNDAY	I don’t know what I believe. 

SUNDAY	I…

SUNDAY	I don’t know who I am. 

SATURDAY	No! No!

SATURDAY	No!

SATURDAY	God damn it!

CAYMAN	They won’t suffer. 

JOE	Excuse me?

CAYMAN	I’m assured of that.

JOE	Um, we may have a containment problem. 

JOE	We still haven’t heard back from the Settman team. 

CAYMAN	Last night I dreamed this whole building erupted and spewed out all the siblings. 

CAYMAN	There were so many of them. 

CAYMAN	This sea of little bodies scorched by flames. 

JOE	I know…

JOE	But this is on their parents. 

JOE	Not you. 

CAYMAN	Sometimes I think to hell with it. 

CAYMAN	To hell with everybody. 

CAYMAN	Humans will never learn. 

JOE	You’re our last chance, Dr. Cayman. 

JOE	Our only hope. 

CAYMAN	I need you, Joe. Be careful. 

CAYMAN	Do not underestimate the Settmans.

JOE	If we officially list them, they’ll be flagged at the first checkpoint

JOE	and processed within hours. 

CAYMAN	Seven siblings surviving to adulthood?

CAYMAN	It would destroy my credibility. No. We have to keep this localized. 

CAYMAN	They are trapped inside that apartment and they know it. 

CAYMAN	Besides. We have another issue. 

CAYMAN	A complication.

CAYMAN	Make that a priority. 

CAYMAN	Then deal with the Settmans. It’s Tuesday’s. No. 

SATURDAY	What the fuck are we doing? Huh?

SATURDAY	We got to get out of here now. 
 
SATURDAY	They know about us. They’re going to send more people. 

WEDNESDAY	Let them come. I’ll fucking kill them all. 

THURSDAY	Calm down. 

THURSDAY	Just think for a second. 

THURSDAY	Four of us out there at once?

THURSDAY	With all the Bureau agents and checkpoints and sensors?

THURSDAY	We won’t last for two minutes. 

FRIDAY	We always work best as a team.

FRIDAY	In an environment we can control.

THURSDAY	Those guys-- they weren’t Bureau. 

THURSDAY	We’d be listed by now. This place would be crawling with agents. 

THURSDAY	Somebody wants us to disappear. 

THURSDAY	The question is why. Fuck it.

WEDNESDAY	Every Wednesday I wear a stupid dress and high heels.

WEDNESDAY	Not today.

WEDNESDAY	What’s that?	

FRIDAY	Something I wish I thought of yesterday.

FRIDAY	I customized it…

FRIDAY	so we’ll see and hear everything you do.

FRIDAY	It’s a user-locked grip. 

WEDNESDAY	Can you unlock it?

FRIDAY	If I had more time. For now, it’s not going to fire. 

WEDNESDAY	Doesn’t make it any less intimidating. 

THURSDAY	This isn’t a game, Wednesday. 

THURSDAY	Go to Jerry’s. Find out what he knows. 

THURSDAY	Don’t lose your head out there. 

WEDNESDAY	I won’t. 

JERRY	Hello, Karen. You’re cutting it close. 

JERRY	Aren’t you?

JERRY	Please. 

JERRY	A rough night. 

JERRY	Well, I did say you had until this morning, and it’s still morning, I guess. 

JERRY	technically, so

JERRY	What’s it going to be?

WEDNESDAY	What’s what going to be?

JERRY	Do we have a deal or not?

WEDNESDAY	Deal. What deal?

JERRY	Playing dumb doesn’t suit you, Settman. 

JERRY	This is very simple. 

JERRY	You pass on the promotion…

JERRY	it goes to me.

JERRY	And I keep my mouth shut about your little secret. 

WEDNESDAY	You motherfucker!

WEDNESDAY	How long have you known? Huh?

JERRY	You should be glad it was me that found that contract. 

JERRY	Or you’d be in jail by now. 

WEDNESDAY	What contract?

JERRY	Are you serious?

WEDNESDAY	What fucking contract?

JERRY	407-C funds transfer.

WEDNESDAY	What?

JERRY	Your contract with Cayman. 

WEDNESDAY	Cayman. 

WEDNESDAY	Nicolette Cayman.

JERRY	Yeah. Your new VIP client. 

THURSDAY	Do you guys know about this?

JERRY	Wow.

WEDNESDAY	This contract. Where is it?

JERRY	On my tablet. 

WEDNESDAY	Show it to me. 

JERRY	Yeah.

THURSDAY	Get out of there!

SNIPER	I’ve lost sight of the target. 

JOE	Going in. Hold position. 

WEDNESDAY	Guys? You there?

WEDNESDAY	Which way?

WEDNESDAY	Where do I go?

FRIDAY	Best option is front door. 

ENFORCER	Spread out. 

WEDNESDAY	That’s not an option.

ENFORCER LEADER	Erickson? 

ENFORCER LEADER 	Erickson copy. 

ENFORCER LEADER	Erickson. 

ENFORCER	Sir?

ENFORCER	Sir, do you copy?

JOE	What’s going on up there? Do you need backup?

JOE	I guess so. 

JOE	Move it! Take this sibling down. 

WEDNESDAY	Girls?

WEDNESDAY	I need a way out. Now. 

FRIDAY	There. A dumpster. Below the bedroom window. 

WEDNESDAY	Come on. 

FRIDAY	It’s a three story drop, but the trash will soften the impact. 

WEDNESDAY	You’d better be right, sis.

WEDNESDAY	Fuck! It’s empty. 

FRIDAY	The trash collection is every Wednesday morning. 

FRIDAY	Sorry.

THURSDAY	Are you okay?

THURSDAY	Can you run?

WEDNESDAY	I think so.

THURSDAY	Then run. 

JOE	Go. Go. Go. 

WEDNESDAY	Guys, where am I going?

FRIDAY	Next left. There’s a door at the end of the alley.

SATURDAY	Come on. 

JOE	What are you waiting for? Go get her!

ENFORCER	Move!

ZAQUIA	Get out of the fucking way!

ENFORCER	Get out of the way!

ZAQUIA	Move!

WEDNESDAY	What do I do?

FRIDAY	We need to get you on the roof. 

FRIDAY	I can get you home from there. 

FRIDAY	Hold tight. 

THURSDAY	Oh shit.

FRIDAY	It’s the Bureau.

SATURDAY	I thought you said we’re not listed. 

THURSDAY	We’re not. 

SATURDAY	Then what the fuck is he doing here?

WEDNESDAY	Friday? Friday!

SATURDAY	Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

SATURDAY	What are you going to do?

THURSDAY	Find out what he wants. Get rid of him. 
 
SATURDAY	I got this. 

ADRIAN	Open up. 

ADRIAN	Hey. 
	
SATURDAY	Hey.

ADRIAN	New look?

SATURDAY	Yeah. Yeah, I wanted to try something new. 

ADRIAN	Nice. 

ADRIAN	I called your—your office.

ADRIAN	They said you were out sick. 

ADRIAN	I know. I know I’m not supposed to call,

ADRIAN	but when I saw you at the Bureau.

SATURDAY	The Bureau?

ADRIAN	Yeah. 

SATURDAY	Yeah. Yeah. I had to go and, um,

SATURDAY	drop off some stuff. 

SATURDAY	Boring bank stuff. 

ADRIAN	Aren’t you going to invite me in? I was only joking about the forced entry.

WEDNESDAY	Friday?

FRIDAY	Hold on. We’ve got a situation.

WEDNESDAY	You’ve got a situation?

ADRIAN	It’s a nice place. 

WEDNESDAY	Friday? You there?

THURSDAY	Who the fuck is this guy?

SATURDAY	Please don’t do that. 

ADRIAN	What? 

ADRIAN	Are you serious? 

ADRIAN	I thought you liked that stuff. 

SATURDAY	Just, um. Just give me sec. 

SATURDAY	I’ll be right back. 

ADRIAN	Okay.
 
THURSDAY	What the hell is going on? 

SATURDAY	You tell me. Who is that guy?

THURSDAY	Don’t bullshit me. Have you been seeing him?

SATURDAY	What? No. 

SATURDAY	He’s a Bureau agent. Do you think I’m fucking stupid?

THURSDAY	You two seemed very familiar.

SATURDAY	It’s called acting. 

THURSDAY	How do I know you’re not acting now and you’ve been seeing him all along. 

SATURDAY	I’ve never seen him in my life. I swear to God. 

THURSDAY	You need to get him to take you to his place 

THURSDAY	and find out which one of us he’s been seeing. 

SATURDAY	What!?

THURSDAY	Yeah, find out what he knows.

SATURDAY	Have you lost it completely? You want me to go with him?

THURSDAY	Yeah.

SATURDAY	I think he wants to fuck me. 

THURSDAY	Oh no shit. 

FRIDAY	Show me your bracelet. 

SATURDAY	Why?

FRIDAY	It’s a coupling device from the dead guy’s bracelet. 

FRIDAY	All you need to do is get yours close to his.

SATURDAY	Wha-wha-wha-wait. What?

FRIDAY	Just activate your bracelet and connect it to that guy’s,

FRIDAY	and we get a gateway into the Bureau’s servers. 

SATURDAY	What if he catches me? 

THURSDAY	Well, I’m sure you know a few tricks to distract him. 

SATURDAY	Well, I don’t know any tricks.

SATURDAY	Well couldn’t you get another job?

ADRIAN	Why would I want another job?

SATURDAY	Don’t you think it’s wrong to be rounding up siblings?

ADRIAN	Have you ever set foot in the lower sectors?

ADRIAN	they live in really shitty conditions.

ADRIAN	Jesus Christ, you’re a sibling. 

THURSDAY	Yeah. One of seven. 

THURSDAY	Identical in every way. 

THURSDAY	Well…not in every way. 

ADRIAN	Karen. 

ADRIAN	I saw her in a body bag.

ADRIAN	Where’s Karen? Is she still alive? Where’s Karen?

THURSDAY	 Monday?

CAYMAN	Ah, Karen. 

CAYMAN	How are you enjoying your stay?

CAYMAN	I trust we’ve made you comfortable. 

MONDAY	More than comfortable. 

CAYMAN	We failed miserably as a species on this planet. 

CAYMAN	Masterminding our own extinction. 

CAYMAN	But through it all…

CAYMAN	Through your donation and my push for Parliament…

CAYMAN	we might just still have another chance. 

THURSDAY	Take your wig off. 

THURSDAY	Take it off!

CAYMAN	If you’re beginning to have second thoughts,

CAYMAN	you should know that I’ve kept one of your siblings alive as collateral. 

CAYMAN	And after all…

CAYMAN	anyone who’s willing to sacrifice their own flesh and blood, 

CAYMAN	can never be fully trusted. 

CAYMAN	So, 

CAYMAN	how does it feel to be the one and only Karen Settman?

THURSDAY	When you get into the main server, use the code Friday wrote.

THURSDAY	Cayman’s speech starts in 15 minutes. 

ADRIAN	Let’s go.

THURSDAY	Let’s take this bitch down. 

JOE	Fuck. 

TUESDAY	Nobody moves.

TUESDAY	Open the fucking door now or I’ll shoot him!

ENFORCER #1	Do it!

ENFORCER #1	Do it. 

THURSDAY	Monday.

MONDAY	I’m impressed. You’ve never worn Karen Settman so well. 

THURSDAY	You think you own her. You don’t.

MONDAY	I do her justice. 

MONDAY	You only pretend. 

CAYMAN	Thank you for coming this evening.

CAYMAN	I’m deeply honored and grateful.

JOE	I got to get to Cayman. 

JOE	Get her away from the servers. 

THURSDAY	You sold us out.  How could you?

MONDAY	I thought you, of all people, would understand. 
THURSDAY	Understand? We were your family. 

MONDAY	What do you know about family?

MONDAY	All these years of endless lectures about responsibility and sacrifice? 

MONDAY	I never saw you do any of it. Not once. 

MONDAY	I did everything I was told. 

MONDAY	Everything right. 

MONDAY	I did everything I could to protect our family. 

THURSDAY	You have a funny way of showing it. 

THURSDAY	Sunday died in my arms. 

THURSDAY	Wednesday fell to her death. 

THURSDAY	Saturday was shot in the head and Friday…

MONDAY	I didn’t plan this. 

MONDAY	I met Adrian and I fell in love. 

MONDAY	And things changed. 

MONDAY	I made a deal with Cayman and-and it got out of my control. 

THURSDAY	I’m sorry. 

THURSDAY	I’m sorry you lost your finger because of me. 

THURSDAY	I was a…I was a total fuck up. 

THURSDAY	If I could go back and change it all, I would 

THURSDAY	Karen Settman. 

THURSDAY	was so much ore than any one of us. 

THURSDAY	She was all of us. 

THURSDAY	She was our family. 

MONDAY	I was the first born. 

MONDAY	Karen Settman was always mine. 

MONDAY	The rest of you?

MONDAY	You were just afterbirth. 

CAYMAN	For three decades, the Child Allocation Bureau 

CAYMAN	has combatted the most serious crisis…

CAYMAN	our world has ever faced. 
CAYMAN	Catastrophic overpopulation. 

CAYMAN	Critics may chastise our methods,

CAYMAN	but the numbers don’t lie. 

CAYMAN	In a perfect world, every child has the right to live. 

CAYMAN	That’s why I’m running for office.

CAYMAN	So I can reform the law. 

CAYMAN	Anyone who wants to bring a child into this world
 
CAYMAN	must be able to prove financial stability…

CAYMAN	and be able to guarantee

CAYMAN	the emotional and physical well being of that child. 

CAYMAN	There may even be room for siblings

CAYMAN	if the data measures up.

CAYMAN	So I commend you for your vision

CAYMAN	as we continue to take positive action…

CAYMAN	to build a sustainable future…

CAYMAN	full of hope and possibility.

CAYMAN	Together

CAYMAN	We will

CAYMAN	survive. 

TUESDAY	Are you okay?

ADRIAN	Hit it.

CAYMAN	They didn’t suffer. No, they didn’t suffer. 

CAYMAN	They didn’t suffer.

CAYMAN	They didn’t suffer.

CAYMAN	What have you done?

CAYMAN	What have you done?

TERRENCE	Monday. 

TERRENCE	I need you to be brave. 

TERRENCE	Set an example for your sisters. 

TERRENCE	I’m just trying to protect you. 

TERRENCE	I’m so sorry.

MONDAY	Promise me…

MONDAY	Don’t let them take them. 

MONDAY	Don’t let them take them. 

ADRIAN	Hey baby. 

ADRIAN	Stay with me, okay? 

ADRIAN	Hey, you okay? Okay. 

FEMALE NEWSREADER	Federation wide rioting…

FEMALE NEWSREADER	has forced the repeal of the Child Allocation Act. 

FEMALE NEWSREADER	Hundreds of siblings held in processing centers have been released.

FEMALE NEWSREADER	Pregnant women are coming out of hiding in droves…

FEMALE NEWSREADER	the majority from poorest districts. 

FEMALE NEWSREADER	Without this repeal, many of these children would have been discarded…

FEMALE NEWSREADER	or processed the minute they were born. 

CAYMAN	This planet is the only home you will ever know. 

CAYMAN	So look around. 

CAYMAN	Ask yourselves who will continue to make the

CAYMAN	difficult decisions that will ensure your survival. My regret. 

CAYMAN	My regret is that your children will never know 


CAYMAN	the world we could have built together. 

CAYMAN	That hope is gone forever. 

ADRIAN	I like your new eye, Tuesday. 

ADRIAN	They did a good job.

TUESDAY	Thank you. 

TUESDAY	Oh, it’s not Tuesday anymore. It’s Terry. 

ADRIAN	Okay, Terry. 

ADRIAN	So, what should I call you?

THURSDAY	Karen. 

THURSDAY	Karen Settman. 

THURSDAY	Monday did it all for them. 

THURSDAY	She wanted them to be safe. 

TUESDAY	Well…

TUESDAY	They will be.
