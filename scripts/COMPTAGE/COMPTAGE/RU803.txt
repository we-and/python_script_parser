RUPAUL	Previously on "RuPaul's Drag Race"... This is the th episode of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

ALL	Yes!

ACID BETTY	Whoo!

RUPAUL	Each of you will be assigned a design challenge from a past season. Naysha Lopez.

NAYSHA	I don't really sew.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi.

CARSON	You were giving me, like, this Cowardly Lion ferociousness.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen.

MICHELLE	I felt like the bottom half was just a cop-out.

RUPAUL	Do you think that your missteps would warrant you in the bottom?

LAILA	I don't think that I am the least put together.

RUPAUL	Who do you think is the least put together?

LAILA	Naomi. Her look is very plain.

RUPAUL	Do you agree with that, Naomi?

NAOMI	No.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi, condragulations. You're the winner of this week's challenge.

DRAG QUEEN	Yeah, girl.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen, shantay, you stay. Naysha Lopez, sashay away.

ROBBIE	Girl.

DRAG QUEEN	Whoo.

BOB	Oh, my gosh.

DRAG QUEEN	Aww.

ROBBIE	The first message in lipstick on a mirror. Holy [bleep]. Too real.

LAILA	"It was a pleasure meeting you all. Play the cards you are..."

LAILA AND THORGY	"Dealt and turn da party."

LAILA	Aww.

THORGY	Cutie.

LAILA	I'm sad to see her go. She had such a nice butt.

CYNTHIA	I'm gonna miss my sister a lot, so te amo, mamita. For me it's shocking that Naysha left this competition too sooner because I know she can offer a lot more.

NAOMI	So, Laila, were you gagged that I was not in the bottom two?

LAILA	I had to say something. To be honest, I do not think that a lot of the girls really deserved to be safe. Naomi's boat looked like [bleep]. Cynthia's outfit was a knockoff pink version of Detox's from her season, and Miss Derrick Barry--girl, the first episode, a bikini, really? It was so hard to read. Between you, me, her, and Naysha, I was like, "I honestly have no idea who they're gonna pick."

NAOMI	But you wanted... I don't blame Laila for being salty about being in the bottom two. I think she's feeling like she's really just blending in. Everyone wants to meet the star, not the entourage, and right now Laila's just giving entourage.

LAILA	Oh.

MAN 	RuPaul's Drag Race.

RUPAUL	The winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race" receives a one year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $,. With extra special guest judges Jamal Sims, Lucian Piane, and "Pitch Perfect"'s Ester Dean.

MAN 	RuPaul's Drag Race. May the best woman, best woman win.

DRAG QUEEN	Good luck.

DRAG QUEEN	Good morning.

BOB	Walk into the room purse first. Clack.

THORGY	We've all survived the first elimination. The race has finally begun.

KIM CHI	Bye, Naysha.

DERRICK	There goes the prettiest one.

BOB	She was beautiful. Emphasis on "was." Who's the next prettiest?

DRAG QUEEN	I know Britney wants to think she is.

DERRICK	Why can't I know I am?

ACID BETTY	'Cause Naomi's in the room.

ALL	Ooh!

BOB	Girl.

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

DRAG QUEEN	Yay!

DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

RUPAUL	Now, ladies, who likes to dance?

RUPAUL	Good, because for today's mini challenge, we're having a Latin style dance off.

CYNTHIA	Yes.

RUPAUL	I want to see you swing those hips to a song by AB Soto featuring me, "Cha Cha Bitch." Yes. You need to create a unique outfit using clothes provided by Out of the Closet thrift store, benefitting the AIDS Health care Foundation since .

THORGY	Oh, awesome!

RUPAUL	So grab your cha-cha heels, get into quick drag, and meet me on the dance floor. Go.

DRAG QUEEN	Go.

BOB	Anyone need a mother of the bride outfit?

DRAG QUEEN	I love it.

BOB	Someone should be doing J. Lo and just ass out.

RUPAUL	All right, kids, time's up. Señoritas, look who's here to help me judge the "Cha Cha Bitch" fight. Say hello to AB Soto.

ALL	Whoo!

RUPAUL	So, AB, any words of advice for my chicas?

AB SOTO	Yes, give me reina, give me perra, and work your cha cha, bitch.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Acid Betty, you're first. Ready, set, cha cha, bitch.

AB SOTO	Ain't no party like a cha cha party 'cause a cha cha party goes ah!

DRAG QUEEN	Yeah!

DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!	

RAG QUEEN	Ow!

AB SOTO 	Five, six, cha cha, bitch.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

AB SOTO 	Cinco, seis.

RUPAUL AND AB SOTO 	Cha cha, bitch.

RUPAUL	Yes, honey, we are serving taco Tuesday. Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

AB SOTO 	They wanna know, ¿oye quién es ella? ¿Qué es lo que quiere la nena?

RUPAUL	The cha-cha heels are alive.

AB SOTO 	Now dance, I got the itch.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

DRAG QUEEN	Whoo! Yes, ma'am.

AB SOTO 	Cha cha, bitch.

RUPAUL	Dax ExclamantionPoint.

AB SOTO 	Uno, tres, cinco, seis.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls. (laughs)

AB SOTO 	Five, six, cha cha, bitch.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen.

AB SOTO 	Five, six, cha cha, bitch.

RUPAUL	Señorita Robbie Turner. Chi Chi DeVayne.

AB SOTO 	Cha cha cha, cha cha cha. Cha cha cha, cha cha cha, cha cha cha.

AB SOTO	Cha cha cha, cha cha cha, cha cha cha.

RUPAUL	Take that, Donald Trump. Kim Chi.

AB SOTO 	Cha cha cha, cha cha cha, cha cha cha, bitch. Cha cha cha, cha cha cha, cha cha cha.
	
AB SOTO 	Cha cha cha, cha cha cha, cha cha cha, bitch.

BOB	This is sad. Kim Chi has two left feet and vertigo.

DRAG QUEEN	Work!

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor. (laughs)

AB SOTO 	Cha cha, bitch.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Oh, my goodness. I'ma call immigration on y'all. Ladies, we'll be posting all of your best "Cha Cha Bitch" moves at LogoTV.com, but two of you were the baddest bitches of all. The winners are... Cynthia Lee Fontaine...

RUPAUL	And Chi Chi DeVayne.

RUPAUL	Let's give a big "Drag Race" thank you to AB Soto.

ALL	Whoo!

RUPAUL	Now, cha cha, bitch. Ladies, I'm glad you're all warmed up because this week's maxi challenge is an all dancing, all lip-synching extravaganza.

ALL	Whoo!

KIM CHI	Choreography? Mm-mm.

RUPAUL	You'll be competing in two teams in the dragappella movie "Bitch Perfect."


RUPAUL	#BitchPerfect, okay? Plus you'll be meeting with a choreographer who's worked with Miley, Madonna, and J. Lo, honey. The red hot Jamal Sims.

DERRICK	Whoo!

RUPAUL	Cynthia and Chi Chi, you won the mini challenge, so you are team captains. Cynthia, your group is the Lady Bitches. Chi Chi, your group is Shady Bitches. All right, ladies, it's time to pick teams. Cynthia, who will you choose first?

CYNTHIA	Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB	All right, all right.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi, you're next.

CHI CHI	Acid Betty.

ACID BETTY	It don't get shadier than this.

CYNTHIA	Derrick Barry.

DERRICK	Oh, thank God I did not get picked last.

CHI CHI	Thorgy Thor.

THORGY	Whoo! Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yow.

CYNTHIA	Laila.

LAILALaila.
	
CHI CHI	Let's go with Dax ExclamationPoint.

DAX	Yay, my turn.

CYNTHIA	Robbie.

RUPAUL	That means that Kim Chi and Naomi Smalls are left.

CHI CHI	Sorry, Kim, but I'm gonna have to go with Naomi.

RUPAUL	Which of course means that Kim Chi goes to Cynthia's team.

KIM CHI	Wah. It's okay. I wouldn't want me either.

RUPAUL	Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.

CYNTHIA	All right, Lady Bitches, are you ready?

ROBBIE	Let's go through the personalities.

BOB	Kim, I feel like you're the one who is kind of, like, nerdy and not cool.

KIM CHI	Yeah.

BOB	Derrick, I think you should be the mean, bitchy leader. Regina George.

DERRICK	I'm the ringleader.

ROBBIE	I think you should be, like, her kid sister.

BOB	You do exactly whatever she does, just not as good as she does it.

DERRICK	Aw, Laila's my impersonator. That's cute.

ROBBIE	Yeah.

LAILA	My biggest concern is that I'm gonna fade into the background comparatively to all the other girls, so I'm not sure about playing the, like, little sister, like, wannabe Derrick Barry, 'cause I probably wouldn't be the best Britney impersonator.

CHI CHI	So, girls, like, we're gonna, like, take one, pass it down.

ACID BETTY	I think we should get some choreography together.


CHI CHI	Let's just worry about that when in time comes. Don't--don't confuse yourself. We need to know where you come in first.

ACID BETTY	I think after this we should put something together just in case.

CHI CHI	Don't get scared.

ACID BETTY	I'm not scared. I'm just trying to be prepared.

CHI CHI	I know, but--

ACID BETTY	I'm not gonna be unprepared because of you, boo.

THORGY	I've known Betty for, like, ten years, and sometimes because Betty is so artistic, she gets away with being a [bleep] asshole.

CHI CHI	Let's go from the beginning. "Oh, really, is that all you got? What about this?"

ACID BETTY	Is that what you're gonna be doing?

CHI CHI		"Lake, Lake, Titi, Titi, Titi." Yeah.

ACID BETTY	No, you're gonna be out there.

CHI CHI	Whatever.

ACID BETTY	Well, we should probably set it instead of "whatever." Let's get beyond "whatever."

CHI CHI	Okay.

THORGY	Acid Betty is an asshole, and she knows it, and she loves it, and that's why she doesn't work in New York. She's so demanding and mean to everyone that nobody wants to work with her. You're gonna be shamed. You're gonna be put down, so, Chi Chi, good luck.

DERRICK	One, two, three, four. This week's maxi challenge is an a cappella lip-sync battle. We have to lip-sync, we have to dance. Basically we're putting out "Bitch Perfect."

DAX	Look at this giant [bleep] heel.

DRAG QUEEN	Yeah.

DAX	Those are so cute.

CHI CHI	Bitch, I hope y'all can dance in them high-ass heels. You need something this size, hon.

ACID BETTY	Have you ever, guys, been in proper shows before where you have to learn choreography and stuff?

NAOMI	When I was a kid, yes. Like, for years.

ACID BETTY	Just--oh, when you were younger. So you don't really know how to, like, just focus and get it done?

DAX	Yeah, I do.	

ACID BETTY	'Cause we're talking about shoes. I would love to, like, save the time and figure out what we're doing. This is how the group's gonna down. "So what'd you guys do?" "Well, we spent time talking about how comfortable these shoes were."

THORGY	We're not going down.

DAX	No.

ACID BETTY	My worry with this group is that I might be the only one that's gonna give it and the other girls are just gonna take me down with them. Chi Chi needs to step up and get us together.

RUPAUL	Hey, kitty girls.

BOB	Hey, Ru.

ALL	Hi!

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee.

CYNTHIA	Hi, RuPaul.

RUPAUL	What's the name of your group?

CYNTHIA	My name of my group is--

RUPAUL	You've got to look at a paper to get the name of your group? Lady Bitches.

CYNTHIA	Yes, ma'am.

RUPAUL	So, now, Kim Chi, this is a lip-sync challenge. Are you a lip-sync artist?

KIM CHI	I think I am, but my biggest problem is sometimes when I lip-synch my lisp comes through.

RUPAUL	I'm not mad at a lisp.

KIM CHI	Yeah.

RUPAUL	In fact, I'm partial to a lisp. Are you familiar with the movie "Pitch Perfect?"

KIM CHI	I've never heard of it or even know what it's about. I was probably in Korea at the time.

RUPAUL	Well, it just came out, uh, six months ago.

CYNTHIA	Oh, my God. Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

RUPAUL	So now, Laila, why do you think you wound up in the bottom two?

LAILA	Well, the photo with Mathu was definitely less than amazing.

RUPAUL	Right, because, you know, you were scrunched over. You weren't shining through. How are you gonna shine through in this challenge?

LAILA	I ain't gonna be squatting down and sitting in the back. I'm gonna come forward and be present.

RUPAUL	Well, you know, a lot of girls say that. There's more strategy to it than that. You realize that?

LAILA	Yes, ma'am. I get it. I need to bring myself up to the level of the other girls so I can be like, "I'm here too." It's not just them. I am here.

RUPAUL	All right, get to work.

BOB	Thank you.

RUPAUL	All right.

LAILA	Thanks, lady.

DRAG QUEEN	Whoo.

RUPAUL	Well, all right, now.

DRAG QUEEN	Hey.

DRAG QUEEN	Hi, Ru.

DRAG QUEEN	Hi, Ru.

RUPAUL	Are y'all the Shady Bitches?

CHI CHI	Yes, we are.

RUPAUL	Are there any shady bitches in this group? Oh, okay, well, there you have it. Now, Chi Chi, you're the leader. How are you navigating all of these strong personalities?

CHI CHI	I'm finding them a little bit difficult. I've never had to deal with such big personalities. It's just, like, girl.

RUPAUL	Okay, well, is anybody afraid of choreography?

THORGY	No.

ACID BETTY	I prefer the whole thing to be choreographed. I feel safer, and I think I'm having a hard time getting her to actually put down the steps.

THORGY	Maybe you should be more of a tyrant.

CHI CHI	I cannot be a tyrant. That's not in my blood. I think I'll give that part to Acid Betty.

RUPAUL	Oh.

CHI CHI	Yeah.

RUPAUL	Are you a tyrant, Acid Betty?

ACID BETTY	No, I haven't showed that side yet.

CHI CHI	Girl.

ACID BETTY	She's the leader, so I'm letting her kind of make decisions.

RUPAUL	All right, get back to work, and knock 'em dead. All right. Thanks.

DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

THORGY	Let's get this work done.

RUPAUL	All right, ladies, gather round. Now, if at any time during this competition you feel the need to get something off your chesticles--yes, take advantage of the Shade Tree.

DRAG QUEEN	Uh-oh.

DRAG QUEEN	Oh.

RUPAUL	Think of it as a diary room where you can say whatever you want in total privacy.

ALL	Ooh.

RUPAUL	So good luck, and don't [bleep] it up. All right?

ALL	All right.

JAMAL	Hey, hey, hey, Team Lady Bitches.

BOB	We're ladies, and we're bitches.

CYNTHIA	My team are setting up to met Jamal. I'm so excited about that. He's a sexy--mmm--chocolate flavor. (laughs)

CYNTHIA	Did my teeths look yellow? No.

JAMAL	So let's start from the top, yeah? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six. Let me see you do it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

BOB	Kim Chi is the worst dancer...

KIM CHI	Whoops.

BOB	In "Drag Race" history.

BOTH	One, two, three, four.

BOB	We're not doing crazy stuff. We're not pirouetting and back flipping. Step, touch, and not only that, it's the first move. We're[beep].

JAMAL	Let me have you two do it by yourselves.

ROBBIE	Don't be--one, two.

KIM CHI	Okay, can we--can we start over. I'm so sorry. All right.

JAMAL	Five, six, seven. Don't be--

LAILA 	Jealous of my boogie. Don't be jealous of my boogie.

KIM CHI	Whoa.



JAMAL	Uh-oh.

LAILA	Are you all right, sweetie?

CYNTHIA	Kim Chi falls, and just my heart drops out of my cuckoo. Oh, my God.

JAMAL	Kim Chi, are you sure you want to keep doing it in heels?

KIM CHI	%.

JAMAL	Okay.

CYNTHIA	She need to nail this because if she falls tomorrow in front of the judges live, we are completely done.

JAMAL	Shady Bitches in the house.

ALL	Hey.

CHI CHI	So we're working with the fabulous Jamal Sims. I'm ready for him to just give us some structure to this dance routine that I've come up with. Well, what about this? Tit, tit, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Titi, Titicaca.

ALL	Ay!

CHI CHI	Ay.

ACID BETTY	What!

ALL	Ay.

ACID BETTY	Oh!

ALL	Ay.

ACID BETTY	Bitch.

ALL	La-la, la, la-la.

JAMAL	All right, guys. So you guys have a lot of good ideas, and I think we could kind of clean 'em up and make 'em...

DRAG QUEEN	Together.

JAMAL	Cohesive. "Cohesive" is the word.

ACID BETTY	I'm so happy that we have a little bit of choreography like I suggested--Chi Chi, because now we're with Jamal, and he's actually using our choreography.

JAMAL	Give me one shot, and then from here, grab each other's arms so--yeah, lock in underneath--

THORGY	Underneath. Underneath.

JAMAL	There you go.

DAX	Oh, sorry.

JAMAL	Five, six, seven.

ALL 	Give me one shot, one shot.

DAX	Oh.

ACID BETTY	What the hell?

DAX	Can we scooch down a little teeny bit? Like, can we get a little bit more space for us? Thank you.

ALL 	Give me one shot, one shot.

JAMAL	Oh, one more time.

DAX	Sorry.

JAMAL	Yeah. How you feeling?

DAX	I mean, I'm shaky on it, but I got to go through it a few times and I'll get it. Like, that's how I work. Like, if I think while I'm dancing, I can't do it. I get really in here, and it just becomes all [bleep] up, so...

JAMAL	Dax's attitude was really off-putting to me just because it didn't feel like she really wanted to do it. I think there's a lot of insecurity there. You have to push yourself on this one, 'cause we don't have a lot of time.

DAX	Totally. It means a lot for me to be here, and I don't want to have to go back to Savannah and find some [bleep] day job picking up dog [bleep], so I will make it work.

DRAG QUEEN	Oh.

ACID BETTY	Shady Bitches.

DERRICK	Ooh, we're gonna kill the Shady Ladies.

CHI CHI	Oh, my goodness.

KIM CHI	Time to get styling. Today's elimination day. This the first time we're performing for the judges. I'm very nervous. How did your group's rehearsal go?

CHI CHI	It went well, but I have to understand that everybody's not a dancer, so I can't be frustrated about it. You know what I mean?

KIM CHI	Oh, yeah. This challenge--when I first got it, I'm like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, my biggest nightmare." Growing up, I was definitely an outsider. The weird, fat art kid who had a strong lisp and a strong accent, and that's why I just really never learned how to dance and never learned how to, like, feel the music. I used to be  pounds.

ACID BETTY	?

DRAG QUEEN	Jesus.

KIM CHI	Yeah. Until about  / years ago.

BOTH	Wow.

KIM CHI	Obviously, like, I'm not as fat as I was before, but the fat kid is, like, still in me.

ACID BETTY	Oh, yes.

DAX	Yeah, no, it never goes away, girl.

ACID BETTY	Come on, proof. This is me fat.

BOB	Oh, queen.

KIM CHI	Oh, my God.

BOB	Girl, you look completely different.

DAX	I was chubby too. I was always aware it, like, when I was kid, like, 'cause other kids made it very apparent like, "Mm, reminding you. Not only are you super gay, but you're also chubby." When I was an overweight kid, being ridiculed and made fun of, I wanted to have that poise and that confidence and that power, and now finally with drag I can do that.

KIM CHI	That's how it was. Like, when you're fat, people just, like, just don't treat you like--

DAX	Like a person?

KIM CHI	Yeah. Because of those experiences, I'm still learning how to be confident in myself and how to be comfortable in my own skin, but just like all the other things I'm doing here, I want to commit to it and become better.

BOB	Did people start hitting on you when you lost the weight?

KIM CHI	I'm still a virgin, so no.

ACID BETTY	What?

ROBBIE	What?

ACID BETTY	I was totally coming onto you when I met you that one time.

BOB	Maybe people are hitting on you and you literally have no clue. Is that a possibility?

KIM CHI	Not really; I don't know.

ACID BETTY	Yes, yes.

BOB	I think so. Acid said she was hitting on you and you--

ACID BETTY	I was, hard too.

KIM CHI	I just thought you were being friendly.

ACID BETTY	I'm gagging.

KIM CHI	Hopefully someone sees the beauty in me one of these days.

BOB	I don't think Kim Chi knows what she looks like. She's still a virgin because she's not aware that she's, like, a good-looking '" man. You got to own that.

CHI CHI	So, Cynthia.

CYNTHIA	Uh-huh?

CHI CHI	What was it like in Puerto Rico?

CYNTHIA	Oh, amazing.

CHI CHI	They got a lot of gangs in Puerto Rico too.

CYNTHIA	Yes.

CHI CHI	When I was younger, girl, I wanted to be in a gang. Girl, I had a gun, a . Special.

ROBBIE	What?

CHI CHI	Yes, God. I was a little gangbanger. Girl, I've seen people shot.

ROBBIE	Oh, my God.

CHI CHI	I've smelled, like, the smell of brains.

ROBBIE	Chi Chi, that is insane.

CHI CHI	Girl, when I tell you I come from the streets, I'm not kidding. People don't make it where I come from.

ROBBIE	Were you doing all of that with gangs and everything 'cause you were trying to hide the fact that you were gay?

CHI CHI	Yeah, 'cause I was afraid of what my mom, my brother, you know, everybody would think of me. When I look back, I can kind of see why I was acting out. It was because I wasn't being me. When I finally came out, it was a turning point in my life. I could have been dead. I could have been locked up, but I'm here with you girls.

CYNTHIA	So proud of you, baby.

CHI CHI	Baby, I overcame it.

ROBBIE	All right.

CYNTHIA	Okay. (speaking Spanish)

CHI CHI	What?

ROBBIE	What does that mean?

CYNTHIA	"If you can't love yourself, how the hell you can love somebody else?"

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL 	Cover girl, put the bass in your walk. Head to toe. Let your whole body talk. And hat?

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "RuPaul's Drag Race." My duet partner Michelle Visage. Don't you look eloguent?

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	And the writer and the arranger of "Bitch Perfect," Lucian Piane, is here.

LUCIAN	Hey, Ru.

RUPAUL	Our dean of dance, Jamal Sims. Were my girls ladies or shady?

JAMAL	It was a bit of both. (laughs)

RUPAUL	Just the way I like 'em, and multi-talented singer, songwriter, and actress, Miss Ester Dean. Girl, you co-wrote "Firework," "Super Bass," "S&M." When you gonna write a song for us to do?

ESTER	I'm gonna write it right now.

RUPAUL	This week we challenged our queens to be bitch perfect in a dragappella lip-sync extravaganza. Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Once a year, two rival dragappella groups meet in the BoobsForQueens warehouse.

WOMAN	Calling all the basic pitches.

MAN	The Lady Bitches from the Lace Front Institute of Technology...

WOMAN	Well, look who's here for an off-key kiki.

MAN	Have a sing off with the Shady Bitches from the Lake Titicaca Academy of Braids, Weaves, and Waffles.

WOMAN	I thought I smelled out of tuna fishes.

WOMAN	Oh, hell no.

WOMAN	The rules are simple. Keep it cute or sashay away.

WOMAN	Category is RuPaul.

WOMAN	Bitches better beware.

RUPAUL 	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

WOMAN 	Five, six, seven.

MAN 	Don't be jealous of my boogie, jealous of my boogie, jealous of my boogie, jealous of my boogie.

RUPAUL 	Hey, DJ, love the way I lose my inhibition when you spin. And I don't care if people stare. I'd rather boogie than try to fit in. Don't be jealous of my boogie, jealous of my boogie, You can say that you are not, but I always see you looking. Don't be jealous of my boogie, jealous of my boogie.

WOMAN 	Don't be. Don't be.

RUPAUL 	You can say that you are not, but I always see you looking.

WOMAN 	Don't be so jealous of my boogie.

WOMAN	Oh, really? Is that all you got? What about this?

WOMAN 	Lake, Lake, Titi, Titicaca. Titi, Titi, Lake, Lake. Titi, Titicaca, Titi, Titi.

RUPAUL 	Geronimo, Geronimo. They're falling like they're dominos. Sight beat the world and we shall see.

WOMAN 	Ay, ay ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay. La-la-la, la-la.

RUPAUL 	Geronimo, Geronimo. These girls are falling dominoes. They, they call me dynamo, but I be yelling vámanos. So you 'bout to undergo Daenerys. In "A Game of Thrones." No, I'm not no common ho. Slip sliding down a rabbit hole, what?

WOMAN 	And they be slain. I slay these bitches, double Dutch. And they be slain. I slay these bitches, so what's up?

WOMAN	Yeah, so what's up? What else you got?

WOMAN	We'll show you what's up.

RUPAUL 	All of the glamour and all of the fame, people are gonna remember your name. Now and forever, your dreams coming true.

MAN 	Dreams coming true.

RUPAUL 	They're gonna love it whatever you do.

ALL 	Gonna love you.

RUPAUL 	As you are.

ALL 	Gonna love you.

RUPAUL 	You're a superstar.

ALL 	Gonna love you.

RUPAUL 	As you are.

ALL 	Gonna love you.

RUPAUL 	You're a...

ALL 	Superstar.

RUPAUL 	And to the ones I love, know that you're the reason why I dare to live my life, I dare to liberate my mind. You're running through my veins. Make me come alive.

ALL 	Mmm, da-da-da-da. Give me one shot, one shot of adrenaline.

WOMAN 	Oh-oh.

ALL 	Adrenaline.

WOMAN 	Oh.

ALL 	One shot, one shot of adrenaline.

RUPAUL 	Can I get, can I get it to go? Can I get, can I get it to go? Can I get, can I get it to go? Can I get, can I get it to go?

WOMAN	Oh, yeah? Well, listen to our beats.

RUPAUL 	If I dream everything I want to be, if I dream all the possibilities.

RUPAUL 	Pick myself up, turn the world on its head. Don't forget what, don't forget what my mama said.

RUPAUL 	Who, who do you think you are? I'm telling the truth now. We're all born naked and the rest is drag.

RUPAUL 	Scamming money, don't make no money, but freaky money do get the money, 'cause freaky money, do get the money, 'cause freaky, freaky, money, money, money. Money, money, money, money. Money, money, money, money. Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

WOMAN 	Money, money, money, m-money. M-money--money, money, money, money, money, money.

WOMAN	Yo, yo, why are we all battling each other? Aren't we all just mens in wigs?

RUPAUL 	Can I get an amen?

ALL 	Ooh

RUPAUL 	Can I get an amen? If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?

RUPAUL 	Everybody wants her, Ms. Sexy in the city. She's on the prowl. She rock this town.

RUPAUL 	Who's that girl? A fly ferocious lady. Get up and dance, Get up, get up and...

RUPAUL 	Sashay, shantay, panther on the runway. Do it, do it, ohh. All these girls say. Girls say, girls say, girls say, girls say, girls say, girls say, girls say, girls say...

RUPAUL 	This is the main event, are you ready? Just let the music dance into your soul.
RUPAUL 	Cover girl, put the bass in your walk. Head to toe, let your whole body talk. Cover girl, put the bass in your walk.

RUPAUL 	She's so wild, so animal.

RUPAUL 	She's gonna work that sexy body so sexual. She's like a female phenomenon.

RUPAUL 	Cover girl, put the bass in your walk. Cover girl.

RUPAUL 	Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly. Uh-oh, now sissy that walk.

MICHELLE	Oh, my God!

RUPAUL	Category is movie premiere realness.

RUPAUL 	The realness.

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee Fontaine. Hola, como estas? Bob The Drag Queen. As opposed to Bob The Chiropractor.

ALL	Yes.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry. Hey, Derrick.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen. Pretty in green. Robbie Turner.

MICHELLE	Her glamour-puss is on fire.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi. She's like Anna Mae West. Chi Chi DeVayne.

JAMAL	She is your dream girl.

CARSON	Oh, stop.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls. Serving legs, necks, arms. Acid Betty.

JAMAL	Bluetooth.

CARSON	The G network.

RUPAUL	Yes. Dax ExclamationPoint.

MICHELLE	Come on, Lonette McKee. "Cotton Club."

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

JAMAL	She doing the neutron dance.

RUPAUL	She's the drag daughter of a "Solid Gold" dancer. Welcome, ladies. Now, this week you performed in teams, but tonight you'll be judged as individuals. Harshly. Laila McQueen. Thorgy Thor. Kim Chi. Acid Betty. Dax ExclamationPoint. Chi Chi DeVayne. Ladies, you represent the tops and the bottoms of the week, and the rest of you bitches in the background...are safe. You may leave the stage. Now it's time for the judges' critiques. First up, Laila McQueen.

MICHELLE	Hello, Laila, I think the dress is pretty. The problem is, you're lost in it. The hair is flat and long. Everything's being pulled down. You can see none of you.

LUCIAN	And as far as the performance goes, I feel like I wasn't getting much of the comedy, especially with the big personalities around you.

RUPAUL	Up next, Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	I can tell that you cannot dance, but on the positive side of that, you chose a character to cover up that you can't dance, and it worked.

JAMAL	This look is fantastic. Yeah, I just want to smell you.

RUPAUL	Mmm.

MICHELLE	I do get concerned about your walk. It's very stiff, darling.

RUPAUL	How do you say "sissy that walk" in Korean?


KIM CHI	(speaking Korean)

RUPAUL	(speaking Korean)

MAN	Pow, pow.

CARSON	Yes, yes, yes.

RUPAUL	(speaking Korean) Up next, Louisiana glamour. Chi Chi DeVayne.

CHI CHI	Hey, y'all.

JAMAL	Your performance today, you turned it completely out.

ESTER	That got them ass clap. You know, they'd be throwing some dollars at your ass real fast.

JAMAL	You definitely are my new trap queen.

MICHELLE	So tonight, I think you look--for lack of a better term, sort of basic.

LUCIAN	I don't really have anything negative to say about you.

CHI CHI	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Next up, Acid Betty.

JAMAL	What I really loved about what you did is, you were really a team player. You were concerned about everybody else, and I appreciate stuff like that because it lets me know you care.

ESTER	So I love the headpiece. I love the body art. I'm not getting the train.

LUCIAN	I just like looking at you right now.

ACID BETTY	I like looking at you right now.

RUPAUL	Ha-ha!

ESTER	Do you need this?

MICHELLE	The one thing I'm concerned about with you is, you're setting the bar so high. I'll be waiting to see if you can keep raising it 'cause when you'll fall, you'll fall hard.

ACID BETTY	Is that a challenge, Michelle?

MICHELLE	It's always a challenge when I throw it out there, darling.

RUPAUL	Next up, Dax ExclamationPoint.

MICHELLE	One thing I did notice from last week. I have an issue with your padding. It almost gives you a quadru-butt. Just look at it.

JAMAL	The performance, I really wanted you to get that hood, like, uh, you know, and it--and it still never came, and in rehearsals you were saying, "Oh, yeah, I'll do it when I figure out these steps."

DAX	I am not a classically trained dancer in the least, and like, I was also trying to kind of create a character while also thinking too much about other stuff, and like--

JAMAL	You just got to go. Whether you do it wrong or whatever, commit.

RUPAUL	All right, Thorgy Thor.

JAMAL	As far as the dance portion, you're one of the people I didn't have to worry about.

MICHELLE	What I love about the jumpsuit is, it's smart because you said, "You know what? "At a movie premiere, everybody else is gonna do some glamorous gown. I'm gonna do something that's representative of me," But you wear your eyes so black that I'm losing your eyeballs, so blend it out.

THORGY	I'll take that challenge, yes.

RUPAUL	Thank you, ladies. Now, while you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate. Now, just between us altos, what do you think? Laila McQueen.

JAMAL	She was the most improved.

LUCIAN	But didn't really remember what she had done.

ESTER	The only thing I remember about her is the mole underneath her eye, so I don't think that's good.

MICHELLE	You know what this is? This season has very strong personalities. She's out of her league.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi.

JAMAL	When I see her on the runway, I was blown away.

MICHELLE	But because she's had such success with who she is visually, she hasn't had to deliver a performance. But I think there's a personality in there. I just want her to unleash it and let us have it.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne.

MICHELLE	Tonight on the stage, did she play it safe? Yes.

LUCIAN	I loved her outfit. It just seemed very classic and beautiful, and as far as the performance goes, she really slayed the other girls.

RUPAUL	I mean, really.

MICHELLE	Yes.

RUPAUL	She was doing her neck ghetto style upside down while twerking and not missing a word. Honey, I was ready to make the Louisiana Purchase one more time.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty.

LUCIAN	Energy-wise, a complete standout. I particularly loved her runway look with that weird fiber optic spiderweb.

RUPAUL	Yes.

MICHELLE	Look, it wasn't perfect. There was weirdness at the back that looked like draperies being dry-cleaned.

ESTER	And the color's ugly. Sorry.

RUPAUL	Sorry 'bout it. Dax ExclamationPoint.

MICHELLE	It just was all wrong for me. The flower did not go with the dress. The colors were dull, and in the performance you literally forgot that Dax was there.

ESTER	You know, it's like she's the girl in the girl group with the Beyoncé in it.

MICHELLE	She's the Farrah.

JAMAL	LaTavia.

ESTER	I don't want to call no names.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

LUCIAN	She nailed the performance. She came out in that catsuit. It was  degrees different from the performance personality.

ESTER	Just hated the shoes.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

ESTER	They look like ugly shoes.

RUPAUL	Silence. I've made my decision. Bring back my girls.

RUPAUL	Welcome back, ladies. Based on your "Bitch Perfect" performance and your movie premiere eleganza, I've made some decisions. Thorgy Thor, you're safe.

THORGY	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne, not only did you turn it out, girl, you turned it upside down. Condragulations, you are the winner of this week's challenge.

MICHELLE	Wow.

LUCIAN	Wow.

CHI CHI	For real?

ACID BETTY	Really, Ru? Chi Chi sucked as a leader.

CHI CHI	I won a challenge. I'm definitely on the radar. Y'all girls better look out.

RUPAUL	You've won a four-night getaway to an all gay bed and breakfast in beautiful New England courtesy of MyGayGetaway.com.

CHI CHI	So I get to go overseas?

RUPAUL	No, New England is here in the United States.

CHI CHI	Oh, okay.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi, you may cross the seas and join the other girls.

CHI CHI	Whoo!

RUPAUL	Acid Betty, you're safe.

ACID BETTY	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Dax ExclamationPoint, the lack of commitment to your performance forces me to put a question mark after your name. I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.

DAX	I think there were girls that did worse than me, and I'm just pissed about it.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen, in your performance you got lost in the din and tonic. Kim Chi, in your performance you put your left foot forward. Both of them. Laila McQueen, I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination. Kim Chi, you are safe, and you may join the other girls. Two queens stand before me. Prior to tonight you were asked to prepare a lip-sync performance of "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come...
RUPAUL	For you to lip-synch for your life.

DAX	I don't really do disco. It's just not my genre, but I'm pretty confident I can definitely beat, uh, Laila. Sorry, I forgot her name for a second.

LAILA	I feel the song that we're doing has such strong emotion tied with it, and Dax is kind of lackluster, and the song is not lackluster, so I'm like, "You got this."

RUPAUL	Good luck, and don't [bleep] it up.

GLORIA GAYNOR 	At first I was afraid. I was petrified. Kept thinking I could never live without by my side. But I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong. And I grew strong. And I learned how to get along. And so you're back from outer space. I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face I should have changed that stupid lock. I should have made you leave your key. If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me. Go on, now go. Walk out the door. Just turn around now. 'Cause you're not welcome anymore. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give, and I'll survive. I will survive. Oh. Go on now go, walk out the door. Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with good-bye? Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh, no, not I. I will survive. Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive. I've got all my life to live. I've got all my love to give, and I'll survive. I will survive. I will survive.

RUPAUL	Ladies, I've made my decision. Dax ExclamationPoint, Laila McQueen... Neither one of you survived that lip sync. I must ask you both to sashay away.

NAOMI	Shut the [bleep] up.

CYNTHIA	Wait, second time in history of "RuPaul." Two eliminated!

RUPAUL	Thank you, ladies. You may leave the stage.

DAX	Both of us? I know I gave it.

LAILA	I didn't half-ass it.

DAX	I just wish it hadn't gone this way. I look forward to a nap and vodka. Lots of vodka.

RUPAUL	Michelle, may I borrow your phone?

RUPAUL	(sighs) Hi, it's RuPaul.

NAOMI	Who the [bleep] is RuPaul talking to?

RUPAUL	Listen, I had to eliminate two queens today. How soon can you get here?

BOB	 [bleep]. Someone's coming back.
