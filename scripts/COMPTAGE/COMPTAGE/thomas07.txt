(REDS VS BLUES)

THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...being responsible.

THOMAS	When The Fat Controller made James and I responsible for taking everyone to the Dryaw football match, he asked us to work together...

THOMAS	But then we got into a silly argument over which team was the best. The Reds or the Blues.

THOMAS	James and I were so busy hurrying to the match, we forgot about the important jobs The Fat Controller had given us.

THOMAS	Then there was trouble...

THOMAS	The football match hadn't started! James hadn't picked up the Barrow team and I hadn't picked up the referee! (nervous chuckle). 

THOMAS	Luckily, Percy saved the day. He brought both the team and the referee to the football ground.

THOMAS	James and I realised the important thing wasn't which team was best. It was making sure everyone got to the match on time. 

THOMAS	That's why when you're given a job to do, it's important to take responsibility for doing it properly!
