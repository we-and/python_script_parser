Voice Over	Previously on Agent.

Lesego	Oh wait, let me guess, Gloria fucking Gaynor.

Blaze	Every time, every God damn time, that song makes me think of you and Delilah.

Lesego	What about the boy huh? Shouldn’t you have saved the boy too B?

Christopher	Pack a bag bruv, we going to Cape Town. Football expo.

Nina	You look like shit by the way.

Lesego	This is my money.

Lesego	Uh uh, it’s God damn Gloria Gaynor. It don’t mean nothing B.

Blaze	I’m ready to tell you everything.

Monte 	I’ve got you.

Godi	Yoh! Yoh! Yoh! Oh my God.

Godi	What are you doing here?

Monte 	Eh, you know...

Monte	I got lost, lost, lost, lost, lost.

Godi	So, you come to my reception and walk into this office like it’s your house?

Monte	You see what happened, ne? My, my supervisor upstairs, they forgot to sign my pass out receipt.

Monte	So then I decided to come here to see if there’s somebody who can help me.

Godi	Okay. So, where is it?

Godi	The passout?

Monte	Oh.

Monte	So tell me sister, does Lesego ever come here to the office?

Godi	Hardly ever. 

Monte	Ja but he’s your client?

Godi	Hey, doesn’t mean he works here you.

Monte	Uh ja, sorry sister, it’s just, I’m just a fan you see.

Godi	Look, we talk on the phone mostly, for business. Hmm?

Godi	Ja, he can’t be socializing.

Godi	You get that?

Monte	Ja, and you are right, you know these soccer players, yoh, yoh, yoh, they are very busy... busy, busy, busy..	

Godi	Yes.	

Monte	Ja, no thanks for signing, yes sister? Sharp.

Godi	Sharp.

Godi	This guy...

Natalie	Do you mind?

Blaze	Go for it.

Natalie	Sounds like I’m gonna need it.

Natalie	Last chance for you to walk away.

Natalie	You don’t have to tell me anything.

Blaze	I’m not going anywhere. I want to tell.

Blaze	I, I need to tell someone for my own sake.

Blaze	But not just someone. You.

Blaze	Six years ago when I was still a professional footballer, we had just won the league final. We’d finally beaten Goliath. The Buccaneers. 

Blaze	It was our first league win, league victory, in over twenty years.

Lesego 	Well hello ladies. How we doing?

Delilah	We’re sharp.

Lesego	What are your names?

Friend	Dee.

Friend 2 	Phima.

Delilah	Delilah.

Lesego	Hoooo, watch out now, De-li-lah

Lesego	You know...

Lesego	... we won the league tonight so, you know...

Lesego	They gave us the whole VIP area, that’s for us tonight, yeah...

Lesego	Just tell them you’re with Lesego Moleko... and, and Blaze.

Delilah	Sure.

Lesego	Aren’t you too young to be here? 

Delilah	No. I’m eighteen. I’m actually a model, so...

Lesego	Yeah!

Blaze	Alright.

Lesego	You will come right.

Blaze	Ciao ladies.

Delilah	Ciao.

Delilah	Blaze is mine, Blaze is mine, Blaze is mine.

Delilah	I’m claiming him, I’m claiming him.

Natalie	So you’ve been on this no-alcohol kick for years?

Blaze	Yeah.

Blaze	They say alcoholism is hereditary. Funny cos I ran into my dad in Cape Town.

Blaze	For a moment he didn’t even remember me.

Natalie	This Delilah. It’s about her, isn’t it?

Blaze	It starts with her.

Lesego	Wooooo!

Lesego	We won the league, league champiooooons!

Blaze 	Yes!

Lesego	Aaaaah! Voetsek (Go away). Haaa!

Lesego 	What, what, what!

Blaze	We were actually having fun at the club.

Blaze	Our friends were there. It felt good.

Lesego	Wooooh!

Lesego	Bro where’s that chick Delilah?

Lesego	Where is she?

Blaze	Forget about Delilah.

Lesego	But I want her.

Blaze	But we are here, why does it have to be her?

Blaze	Ace come on, there’s plenty of women here.

Lesego	Oooh.

Lesego	Mmmm.

Blaze	The one with the forehead...

Lesego	Aaaaaaah! Woah!

Blaze	Ooooh wee. Mmm.

Lesego	Okay then fuck shit, let’s turn up. Wow. Woooh!

Natalie	So when did you have that first drink?

Blaze	I’m getting to it.

Blaze	Lesego can be persistent.

Natalie	You don’t strike me as the type that is easily peer pressured?

Blaze	But I also know Lesego...

Blaze	... and he wasn’t going to give in.

Natalie	So you drank, even with your own rules and the hereditary issue?

Blaze	We all break our own rules in adulthood. Don’t we?

Natalie	Is this the part where things get bleak?

Lesego	Come on. Come on. 

Lesego	The whole gang is drinking. Everyone is celebrating. What’s wrong with you? Heh? 

Lesego 	When was the last time you and I hung out just like old times?

Lesego	Come on, just one, just one. Come on, man.

Lesego	Blaze, Blaze, Blaze, Blaze, Blaze, Blaze!

Blaze	Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Okay, one just one.

Lesego	Yes! Choo hoooo choo!

Lesego 	Woooo! Hooo! Yo! Fuck shit!

Blaze	You’re crazy.

Lesego	It’s going to be a great night. Oh man!

Lesego	Nine o’clock, check who’s here, look, look, look.

Lesego	In the hizza... or what!

Blaze	Under age, walk away. 

Lesego	Do you think... 

Blaze	Walk away.

Lesego	Do you think she’s looking at me?	

Blaze	You’re hoping she is. 

Lesego	Let’s see...

Blaze	Les! Les! Les!

Lesego	Ladies, Moleko in the house, you already know.

Lesego	You finally came.

Lesego	Yo, surely you came to see me?

Delilah	No, I didn’t come here for you. 

Lesego	Oh, so you came for the free drinks.

Delilah	Uh huh huh huh, no, we actually can afford our own drinks.

Delilah	I’m actually here for somebody else.

Lesego	Uh huh huh.

Lesego	You know there’s fuck all there for you.

Lesego	I’m telling you, don’t waste your time.

Delilah	Okay, I’ll be the judge of that.

Lesego	I’m telling you.

Natalie 	Your team’s celebrating a big win. There are models throwing themselves at you. You expect me to believe that you weren’t there. 

Blaze	She was a kid.

Natalie	So you weren’t interested?

Blaze	No.

Natalie	Even slightly?

Blaze	Look, I wanted her far away from us and I was willing and ready to call it a night.

Natalie	Hmm.

Lesego	Aaah! Yaaaa, uh haaaa!

Blaze	Aaah!

Lesego	Yeah! Wooo!

Lesego	Look Blaze, Blaze. I said, one line.

Lesego	Let’s take it to the next level.

Blaze	Are you crazy?

Lesego	Aaaaah. Ha haa.

Lesego	Fuck shit, don’t tell me about girls.

Lesego	You know she says to me... ‘I don’t need your drinks, I don’t need you drinks’...

Lesego	Look at what she’s doing now. Haaaa. Boy. Yoooo.

Blaze	Come tell me what she said.

Blaze	What did she say?

Lesego	Playing hard to get, you know. Ah chicks.

Blaze	What did she say?

Lesego	Heh?

Blaze	What did she say man?

Lesego	Ja, boy.

Blaze	She bounced you. You can score on the field, but not in the club.

Lesego	No, not me!

Blaze	Haaaa!

Lesego	I’m going to work on her.

Lesego	By the end of the night... 

Lesego	... I’m going to sleep with her. Ha haaa. I’m going to sleep with her. Yoh! Shit!

Blaze	Under age, walk away boy otherwise you’ll get busted.

Lesego	No, come let me drink.

Blaze	Drink boy, drink.

Delilah	<Clears her throat>

Delilah	You know what, thanks, I thought your boy was about to harass me again.

Blaze	Ya, I thought you could do with some protection.

Blaze	There are a lot of predators around here.

Delilah	No, protection is not what I need...

Blaze	Oh uh, Delilah, you’re a very pretty young lady.

Delilah	Oh okay. Fair point. Um... aaaaaah! Oh my God.

Delilah	Since you’re protecting me, come protect me on the dance floor.

Blaze	How, how do you know the song?

Delilah	Um what cos I’m seventeen I can’t like the song?

Blaze	You told me friend you’re eighteen?

Delilah	Okay, but if I told you that I was, like, you know, seventeen, would you guys put me on the guest list?	

Blaze	Smart.	

Delilah	Right?	

Delilah	... are you gonna dance with me or you just gonna stand there?

Blaze	If you can keep up, let’s see.

Delilah	Oh okay.

Blaze	Alright.

Blaze	Fucking song keeps on haunting me.

Natalie	Gloria Gaynor. I love that song.

Natalie 	You love that song.

Blaze	That song... that song was never the same after that night.

Blaze	Lesego was on a mission that night. A mission to self-destruct and...

Blaze	... when he goes at it, he goes hard.

Blaze	He’s a fucking maniac at the best of times.

Blaze	It was just downhill after that.

Natalie	He’s obsession with this Delilah girl. What is that about?

Blaze	He’s competitive.

Blaze	And not just on the field.

Natalie	So it’s about you, not her.

Delilah	When’s the DJ gonna play that song? What’s taking him so long?

Blaze  	Deejay?

Blaze 	Woah.

Delilah	Blaze.

Delilah	Are you sharp?

Delilah	Awww,  you’re a lightweight.

Blaze 	Things never go right when I drink. It’s like jinxing everything around me. 

Lesego	Yeah!

Blaze	Walk away, she’s not interested friend. 

Lesego	Yeah!

Lesego 	Hey, why don’t you let the man vomit in peace without a pretty lady watching him, you know. 

Lesego	Isn’t this your song by the way? Yeah! Ha! Woo hooo! Yeah!

Blaze	I shouldn’t have left. I shouldn’t have gone to the toilet. Gotten on that bus. I, I, I should have never gone at all that night.	

Natalie	You would’ve hurled in the VIP section.

Blaze	I shouldn’t have been drinking in the first place.

Natalie	It was a big night-

Blaze	It was the worst night of my life. 

Blaze	Hey! Did you see my friend, the one I was with?

Bartender	The one with the small girl?

Blaze	Ja, ja, ja, ja.

Bartender	They left together.

Bartender	Over there.

Delilah	<screaming>

Lesego	Shh shhh shh shh. 

Lesego	Quiet. Mmm.

Blaze	Lesego! Les! 

Delilah	<screaming>

Lesego	Hey you, piss off man!

Blaze	Get the fuck away from her! Stay there.

Blaze	Dee. 

Lesego	Hey Delilah?

Blaze	Dee Dee, Dee, Dee, Dee, Dee, hey, hey, it's okay. Delilah, it's okay, it's okay, shhh...

Lesego	She wanted it man.

Blaze	Shh, shh. 

Blaze	Shut the fuck up Lesego, shut the fuck up! Delilah, hey, hey, I'm here, it's okay. It's okay, just breathe... just breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, shh, shh, it's me, it's me... hey, hey, wait, wait, it's me.

Delilah	<Screaming>

Lesego	Blaze! 

Monte	Dee, how are you?

Monte	How was your day? 

Delilah	The security company called.

Monte	What did they want? 

Delilah	The gun they gave you...

Delilah	You can’t return it yet, we need that gun. Right, Monte?

Monte	Ya, ya, you’re right, we really do need it. 

Blaze 	Nat... say something!

Natalie	Your friend is a fucking rapist. I warned you.

Natalie	Why is he always so unhinged? Huh?

Blaze	He’s got issues, alright.

Blaze	He practically had to, had to, take care of his entire family. 

Blaze	Absent father- I mean, he doesn't even see them anymore, sends the money every now and again, but they, they live their separate lives now.

Natalie	Your father was absent. Did you rape a girl?

Blaze	Look, I'm no angel, alright. But I also didn't have an entire family relying on me to provide for them.	

Natalie	You are not a rapist.

Blaze	You hate him right now.

Natalie	I never liked him.	

Blaze	He used to be my friend. 

Blaze	So you should hate me too. Right?

Natalie	What the fuck are you doing?

Blaze	What fucking difference does it make Natalie?

Natalie	Give me the fucking bottle.

Blaze	You’re gonna shut up, that’s what you gonna do.

Natalie	Excuse me?

Blaze	Let's see what you think of me after I tell you what happens next... okay?

Blaze	You do realize she’s only seventeen Lesego?

Lesego	She said to me she was eighteen. 

Blaze	But you the fucking grown up here, make the wiser decision!

Lesego	We’re supposed to be celebrating Blaze man!

Blaze	You call this celebrating? That is celebrating?

Lesego	Yes, yes.

Blaze	Fuck the cup! Fuck the league. Fuck the fucking trophy Lesego. You raped a girl.

Lesego	I didn’t rape anyone.

Lesego	That whore was playing hard to get.

Blaze	She didn’t want you, that girl did not want you!

Lesego	I saw that whore at the club.

Lesego	That skank was all over you. She wanted to fuck you. She was wet for sure.

Blaze	You raped an innocent girl because you were jealous of me? 

Lesego	That whore wanted you!

Blaze	Ja but just because... Lesego she was screaming, she was screaming, which means she did not like it!	

Lesego	Well she got me. Yiasus!

Blaze	Hey, hey, hey, where the fuck you think you're going? Huh? Where the fuck do you think you're going?	

Lesego	This fucking party sucks. You're killing my vibe.

Blaze	Fucking give the me keys. Give me the fucking keys!

Lesego	Why?

Lesego	Are you gonna drive?

Blaze	I'm going to take you home one last time.

Lesego	Okay.

Blaze	And then I never wanna see your fucking face again.

Lesego	Okay.

Lesego	Oh you’re my driver now? Okay Mr. Taxi Driver. 

Blaze	Get your ass in the fucking car. Shit! FUCK! Get in the fucking car!

Delilah	When will you get him?

Monte	That bastard...

Monte	... that bastard has ruined us.

Monte	And his life just goes on like business as usual. Like fuck all happened. 

Delilah	I was determined to be somebody in my life.

Delilah	Now look at what’s become of me.

Delilah	Look at me. He’s won. 

Monte	And we all lost. 

Monte	You were going to make it and take all of us with you.

Delilah	Brother, I’m so sorry.

Delilah	I’m so sorry. If I didn’t go to that club, we wouldn’t be here. 

Monte	This is not your fault.

Monte	Don’t ever say that again.

Delilah	Papa was right... 

Delilah	... I ruined myself, Monte. 

Monte	You were young.

Monte	And he took advantage of you!

Delilah	Do you have bullets for that? 

Monte	I think these will be enough.

Delilah	When? 

Monte	Last game of the season.

Delilah	When is the last game of the season? I need the exact time frame, what day, what time, Monte?

Monte	Next week.

Monte	Next week... I’ll have access to the change rooms. 

Delilah	Now is the right time.

Delilah	He is going to pay.

Delilah	We’re going to make him pay.

Monte	Leave it all to me.

Monte	He will definitely pay!

Lesego	Ah yeah. 

Lesego	Why are you killing the vibe? Always killing the vibe.

Lesego	Uh huh. Look at what we have here. Here we go.

Lesego	Last train. Train to heaven.

Lesego	Have some. Oh you don’t want some?

Lesego	How will you get it sitting at the corner?

Lesego	<snorting cocaine> Oooooh. Ah hah.

Lesego	Oh yeah motherfucker.

Lesego	Hey you.

Lesego	Are you still upset about that bitch?

Lesego	She was asking for it boy.

Lesego	How can you go to a club dressed in that way?

Lesego	Aaah fuck shit man.

Blaze	Shut the fuck up Lesego!

Lesego	Ha haaa. Eeeeeh.

Lesego	If I’m wrong and if I’m such an idiot, what do we do now?

Lesego	I don’t even know where we are and I should be the one driving.

Lesego	Okay okay, you know what... you’re wasting time.

Lesego	Why don’t you just turn this car around and take me to the police station right now?

Blaze	Shut the fuck up man. How many fucking times

Lesego	Fuck you man! 

Blaze	Fuck. 

Blaze	Oh shit!

Lesego	<heavy breathing> Fuck!

Blaze	I think we hit something.

Lesego	Oh shit. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

Blaze	What do we do?

Lesego	Just drive.

Blaze	No.

Lesego	Just drive.

Blaze	No!

Lesego	Just drive.

Blaze	Les no!

Lesego	Drive.

Blaze	I'm gonna get out...

Lesego	What are you doing?

Blaze	Shhh.

Blaze	Shhh.

Lesego	Oh shit!

Blaze	<throws up>

Lesego	Fuck! Ooooooooooh fuck!

Natalie	I've seen some terrible things. Far worse than this. But...

Blaze	But?

Natalie	But this is twisted. In the most unfair way possible. 

Natalie	The boy...?

Blaze	By the time we got out of the car...

Lesego	Wait, wait, wait...

Lesego	What you doing with that? 

Lesego	What the fuck are you doing?

Blaze	I need to call the police. Call the police.

Lesego	Are you out of your mind? 

Lesego	Do you want me to spend the night in jail and appear on every newspaper tomorrow?

Blaze	We can’t leave him here.

Lesego	He is dead.

Lesego	He is dead.

Lesego	But if you bring the heat on us we’ll end up in jail. Is that what you want?

Blaze	But Lesego we can’t leave him here. Oh shit.

Lesego	Okay, Chris.

Lesego	Phone Chris.

Blaze	I can’t man.

Lesego	Chris will solve this.

Lesego	Just calm the fuck down. Relax. Jiasus. Calm down.

Lesego	It’s ringing, it’s ringing.

Lesego	Talk to him.

Christopher	Blaze? It's one am in the morning mate. What's going on?

Blaze	We fucked up Chris.

Lesego	Blaze fucked up.

Christopher	Is that Lesego? What the hell’s going on?

Blaze	We were driving back from the party...

Lesego	Blaze was driving.

Blaze	Shut the fuck up! The boy just came from nowhere. He's dead!

Zoe	Who is it?

Christopher	No it’s fine. Just uh, just tell me what happened.

Blaze	Chris we were... we were driving back, me and Les. I didn't see the kid, he came out of nowhere. We should call the cops.	

Christopher	Have you been drinking?

Blaze	Yeah. Yeah.

Christopher	Alright, exactly where are you right now?

Blaze	I don't know where this place is man, we got lost, I think we

Lesego	Weltevreden! It's in Weltevreden.

Christopher	Alright. Don't call anyone. Sit tight. I'm gonna call you right back. I'm coming.

Zoe	Who was that?

Christopher	Ahh, just a client babe.

Zoe	A client at this hour?

Christopher	Huh huh, happens all the time.

Zoe	Not at Apollo it doesn't. There's a strict 10 o'clock lights out policy. You out after that, fined and suspended.

Christopher	I'll be sure to mention it at the next PSL Indaba.

Zoe	And by client you mean Blaze, don't you?

Christopher	No, and by no, I mean, none of your business. You can find your way out Zo'. I'll call ya.

Lesego	Ohhh! Oh Chris. Thank God! Thank God!

Blaze	He's not breathing. He's not breathing Chris!

Christopher 	Fools, the two of you.

Lesego	So we were, we were driving, no no, Blaze was driving, then while we driving, uBlaze, Blaze tries to, tries to, to hit me in a moving car.

Blaze	Ja but you left out the fact that I was driving your drugged, high ass home

Lesego	He killed a kid. He killed a kid.

Blaze	because you raped an underage girl, that's what happened.

Christopher	Fucking idiots!

Christopher 	Fools the two of you!

Christopher 	Fools, the two of you.

Christopher	Do you have any idea... of the gravity of your situation? Hmm? 

Christopher	A rape and a culpable homicide, on the same fucking night?

Lesego	I did, did not rape

Blaze	But she was screaming! She was screaming because she didn't like it. She was screaming because she didn't like it.
Lesego	You hit the kid.

Blaze	You just couldn't keep your penis in your fucking pants!

Lesego	And the kid’s dead!

Blaze	No, It was like that.

Lesego	You...

Christopher	Shut up! Both of you! Are you ready to face jail, to face the hatred of the public, to have your rising careers end?

Lesego	No sir. No sir.

Christopher	Huh?

Lesego	Haai.

Blaze	Let's call the cops man. We need to call the cops.

Christopher	Alright, let's work this... you call the police, you tell them you ran a child over, under the influence, I'm sure they'll be really understanding.

Christopher	Surely they won't throw you into jail to rot; surely your career can recover from this. Let's do the right thing and we all live happily ever after.

Christopher	One more thing. 

Christopher	What happened, and what happens here tonight, remains between the three of us.

Lesego	You have no problem from me sir.

Blaze	Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Christopher	Right then, let's go.

Christopher	Pick up that body. 

Blaze	Okay.

Christopher	Get over there mate.

Christopher	Fucking hell!

Blaze	Do you still think that I'm a good guy?

Natalie	What happened to the body?

Natalie	You're bound to each other. You, Christopher and Lesego. Bound together in a blood pact.

Blaze	I don't know... you just make it sound so... I don't know.

Natalie	I guess I'm talking as a profiler.

Blaze	What are you thinking?

Natalie	I'm thinking it explains your relationship with Christopher. Your surrogate father. The man you never want to disappoint.

Natalie	You acted like you didn't know me, that day after we met in your office. I mean, I took it personally, but I guess for you it was 'I cannot show him that I have gotten close to someone'. 

Natalie	Something tells me that he wouldn't like the idea of you being with me... a cop.

Blaze	Yeah. And Lesego hated the idea of us even more.

Natalie	And then there's that charmer. You know what I think. 

Natalie	And when it comes to you, I think that your 'friend' wishes that he were you. And it kills him that he's not.	

Natalie	Ag man, come on. It doesn't take a psychologist to see that Lesego keeps you near because you are the better person. 

Natalie	He hopes that your goodness... and your sense of moral obligation... will somehow rub off on him.	

Blaze	I tried to stay away from him, okay? Ever since that day, I even had a transfer lined up far away from Marlboro, then that incident happened, forced me to retire. 

Blaze	Later on Chris convinced me to take him on as a client.

Natalie	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer?

Blaze	Something like that.

Natalie	And the kid? Your new client?

Blaze	Herve?

Natalie	The kid on the side of the road...  that you need to nurture and save from danger. The kid in the red top?	

Natalie	And then there are your daddy issues. 

Natalie	You so badly don't want to be like him that you run away from who you are. Not drinking. That's fine. But still keeping people at arm's length...

Blaze	And then there's you...

Natalie	Your damsel in distress. The Delilah you... had to save from Lesego's paws? 

Natalie	The second mistake you will not make again?

Blaze	And when that Gloria Gaynor song came on, I thought, I thought history was gonna repeat itself.

Natalie	Yeah but it didn't. Isn't that just the point? You and I met that night and nothing bad happened.

Blaze	I've never looked at it that way-

Natalie	I've been honest with you. I've told you things that... people think should be hidden.

Natalie	I'm an open book Sli.

Blaze	But maybe there's some parts of this book that you don't want to see.

Natalie	I've just read the worst of it. And I'm still here.

Blaze	In that case, there's something I need to tell you.

Bay Crystal	What?

Blaze	What is it with you, me and Cape Town?

Bay Crystal	It's like we were frozen in time and all the crap in our lives just didn't matter in that moment.

Blaze	That's exactly how I remember it.

Natalie	Did you fuck her?

Natalie	So what exactly are you doing here? Dumping all of this shit on my doorstep. 

Natalie	Who else have you slept with that I don't even know about yet?

Blaze	Nat... come on, you know me better than that.

Natalie	No I don't. I don't fucking know you. 

Natali	eGet out! Get the fuck out!

Blaze	Look, I get it, alright, I really fucked up. 

Blaze	I did it, because I thought we were over. I did it, because I thought we didn't stand a chance. 

Blaze	I did it because I thought you had moved on. 

Blaze	I did it because I wanted you to know everything there is to know about me.

Natalie	Go.

Blaze	Nats... no. You don't mean that.

Natalie	Just go!

Blaze	If you wanna kick me out, because I let an innocent women get raped. That's fine. 

Blaze	If you're kicking me out because I killed an innocent that night... that is fine. 

Blaze	But don't stand there and tell me you gonna kick me out because I cheated on you, because I won't take that shit. 

Blaze	You stand there and tell me you're an open fucking book. I don't believe you. You know why?  

Blaze	Because I know that there is shit about your past that you don't open up to me about. Do I hold it over your head? No I don't, and why? Because I fucking love you. 

Blaze	I love you. So if you want me to go, I'll go Natalie, alright. I'll fucking go.

Jerry	So near yet so far...

Blaze	Not near or far enough Jerry.

Jerry	Sometimes it's just a trick of the eye. But the heart sees it clearly.

Jerry	Feels like the last time Master Blaze.

Blaze	It was good while it lasted.

Jerry	We've met many times before... and we will do so again.
