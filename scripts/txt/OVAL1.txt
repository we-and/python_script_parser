HUNTER	Victoria?

VICTORIA	Will you stop following me?

HUNTER	Talk to me.  I said talk to me.

VICTORIA	(sighs) Let me go.

HUNTER	Not until we talk.

VICTORIA	Did you not hear me?  I said let me go.

HUNTER	No.

VICTORIA	I will scream.

HUNTER	(chuckles) Go ahead.  No one will believe you.

VICTORIA	(inhales deeply) (spits)

HUNTER & VICTORIA	(grunting)

VICTORIA	Oh.  I told you never hit me again.

HUNTER	(panting) I'm sorry.

VICTORIA	No, you're not.

HUNTER	I'm sorry.  (laughs)

VICTORIA	You think this is funny?

HUNTER	Ow.  (grunting)

VICTORIA	Oh.  Get off me.

HUNTER	Oh.  (grunting) Yes?

JERRY	Mr. President, we should really get moving, sir.

HUNTER	I'm gonna need Max.

JERRY	Yes, sir.

VICTORIA	I'm gonna need hair and makeup.

JERRY	Yes, ma'am.

HUNTER	Oh.

MAN	Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, President and the First Lady…

SINGER	It feels like I'm running out of time, out of time, you gotta get yours, I gotta get mine.  Not really sure (indistinct) I just want that you make it when I do.

NANCY	Oh, damn.

DON	Well, this is the first interracial couple in the White House.  They come from the high society elite in America.

WOMAN	Well, Don, the excitement can be felt in both blue-run United States.

DON	Yeah, I'm glad to see that this country could be somewhat united by electing a white president…

NANCY	Hmm.

DON	…who's married to an African American woman.

NANCY	I know.  That's right.  Hmm.  God bless America.  Hey, baby.  What you doing?

CALLIE	Where's my daddy?

NANCY	I don't know.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's go wash your hands and get ready for dinner.  Let me find your daddy.

SHARON & BARRY	(moaning)

BARRY	Yeah?

NANCY	Your baby downstairs, she wants to see y'all.

BARRY	Oh.  Okay, ma.  We'll be right down.

NANCY	Uh-hmm.

BARRY	Uh-hmm.

NANCY	Hurry up.

SHARON	See, we need our own place.

BARRY	Yeah.

NANCY	I couldn't agree more.

BARRY	Ma!

NANCY	I'm just saying.

LILLY	I know, Don.  I'm trying.  I'm trying, okay?

DONALD	(on phone) No, no, you're not gonna make it.

LILLY	(chuckles) I'm at the airport now.

DONALD	Yeah, but there are a line of storms between here and there and they're headed this way.

LILLY	(on phone) Hey, look, I'll be there.  I'll be there, don't worry.

DONALD	You know what?  I knew you should not have gone.  I knew it.

LILLY	Okay, honey, she was having a meltdown about the dress.  I had to go.  I didn't wanna lose her as a client.

DONALD	(on phone) You know what, I can't be with you right now, you understand?

LILLY	Okay, look, baby, I know you're stressed but I'm on the away.

DONALD	But you won't make it in time to get changed.

LILLY	I will.  Look, I'll do my hair and makeup on the plane.  Alicia's gonna meet me with the dress, so I will.

DONALD	Hurry.

LILLY	I will, honey.  Don't worry, okay?

DONALD	(sighs)

YUMA	Is she gonna make it?

DONALD	She better.  Is everything ready?

YUMA	Yes.  Everything is set for his personal office boxes and they are in the head butler's care.

DONALD	Okay.  Has everything been moved out of the Oval?

YUMA	Yes, sir.  And respectfully, these people, they're capable.  They've been doing it many years.

DONALD	Okay.  Then it's great.  What about the kids' room?

YUMA	Done.

DONALD	And who's handling his personal office?

YUMA	Richard.  Sir, this is Richard, our head butler.  Richard, this is Donald Winthrop, our Chief of Staff.

RICHARD	Hello, sir.

DONALD	Hello.  Will you be handling this personal office?

RICHARD	Yes, sir.  I, um, the movers' here, move…

DONALD	No, no, no movements.  I need you to handle this alone, you understand?  Highly sensitive materials we're dealing with.

RICHARD	Yes, sir, I will.

DONALD	Thank you.  Oh.  I mean, it's almost impossible to move one person in and out of the White House and another one in within a matter of hours.

YUMA	Yes, sir.

RICHARD	We've been doing this for years.

DONALD	How long have you been working here, Richard?

RICHARD	It's third my administration, sir.

YUMA	And he has been amazing.

DONALD	Well, we couldn't do it without you.

RICHARD	Thank you, sir.

YUMA	Sir, you should be getting to the motorcade.

DONALD	Yeah.  Yeah.

YUMA	Yeah.  We have it all covered here.  I promise.

DONALD	Thank you, all right?  Thank--thank all of you.  (sighs)

YUMA	He worries.  I'm glad we have you.

RICHARD	Thank you, ma'am.  (sighs)

MS. ELLE	Have you seen all these boxes?

RICHARD	Yes.

MS. ELLE	That's in this room?  And they want you to do this by yourself?

RICHARD	Well…

MS. ELLE	You know your back.

RICHARD	Hey, I got it.

MS. ELLE	No, you don't.

RICHARD	You just make sure you have the meals ready.


MS. ELLE	I've got it.  But this, this seems like a bit much.

RICHARD	Yeah, well, let's not judge them too soon.

MS. ELLE	Do you think they're anything like the Obamas?

RICHARD	We should be so lucky.  (chuckles)

MS. ELLE	Oh, I know.  I know we're supposed to serve at the pleasure at the hand of president.

RICHARD	Yes.

MS. ELLE	But I love the Obamas.

RICHARD	Yes.

MS. ELLE	I mean just so much class.

RICHARD	I know.  I know.

MS. ELLE	And no drama, no hassle, just good, soft, over the earth people.  (clicks tongue) Oh.  (chuckles)

RICHARD	But I'm sure these will be the same.

MS. ELLE	Oh.  Yeah.  I don't think so.

RICHARD	And why not?

MS. ELLE	Have you seen the request she's put in?  It's no starch, it's no salt, it's no sugar, it's no white flours, it's only organic meals.  And she wrote two pages of don'ts for her daughter.  And have you seen the list of demands that she gave to Sherri in housekeeping?  (scoffs) All I can say is diva.

RICHARD	(chuckles) What about him?

MS. ELLE	She didn't leave any request for him.

RICHARD	There you go.  Maybe he is not so complicated.  (laughs)

MS. ELLE	Uh-hmm.  I don't know about that.  I don't have a good feeling about these people.

NANCY	Uh, no, no, no, no.  You are not having cereal.

CALLIE	Please, grandma?

NANCY	No.  You're having a hot meal for dinner.

CALLIE	But grandma and my daddy give me cereal.

NANCY	Oh?  Well, you wait till I talk to them both.

CALLIE	Please?

NANCY	(chuckles) That cute face is not gonna work with me, young lady.

BARRY	What's up?

CALLIE	Daddy, can I have cereal?

NANCY	(clears throat)

BARRY	Uh, no, baby.  Not this time.

CALLIE	You gave it to me for dinner before.

SHARON	I told you she will bust you.

BARRY	Shh.

NANCY	She already told.

SHARON	Ms. Nancy, I need some help with dinner.

NANCY	Oh, no, baby.  You need to go somewhere and wash your hands, don't you?

SHARON	I did wash my hands and I showered.

NANCY	Well, you still need to wash them sheets.

BARRY	chuckles)

NANCY	Oh.  Oh, hey.

RICHARD	Hey, baby.

RUTH	You can't keep me from her.

BARRY	I have custody.  And every time you come around here, you just upset her, so.

RUTH	I just wanna talk to her.

RUTH	I want her to hear me.

BARRY	Ruth, I am telling you right now, leave.

BARRY	What's up, Dad?

RICHARD	(sighs) These boxes.

BARRY	Dad.

RICHARD	Yeah.  No, I--I'll try to move 'em.

BARRY	No, that's not what I'm talking about.  You know you're not supposed to be straining your back.

RICHARD	Uh, well, that's what you're here for.  (chuckles)

BARRY	Uh-huh.  Your wife will have a fit.

RICHARD	Yeah?  Well, she's not gonna know.  Then can you just help me get these up the stairs?

BARRY	Yes, sir.  All these movers in here, though.  Why don't you have them do it?

RICHARD	No, this is personal things, I couldn't trust them.

BARRY	All right.

MS. ELLE	Hey, handsome.  I thought I heard you.

RICHARD	Okay.

BARRY	Hello?

NANCY	Yeah.  Uh, Barry, uh, I'm gonna talk to you about Ruth.

BARRY	(on phone) Ma.

NANCY	Listen, she really needs to be able to see her.

BARRY	(on phone) Mama.

NANCY	But listen, I--I can sit with her.  I mean I think it would be good for her to see her.

BARRY	(on phone) Who are you concerned about here, Ma?  Ruth or Callie?

NANCY	Barry.

BARRY	(on phone) You know that she left her in that crack house, right?

NANCY	Honey, I know.

BARRY	And now she's in that damn cult.

NANCY	(on phone) But she's doing better.

BARRY	Ma, she traded one drug for another.  That is not doing better.

NANCY	(on phone) Well, why if she brings the twin sister with her?

BARRY	I do not want her to see her.  Do you understand?

NANCY	(on phone) Yes.

BARRY	Okay.  Thank you.  Look, Daddy is waiting for me, so I gotta go.

NANCY	Well, go on.

BARRY	(on phone) All right.  Talk to you later.

NANCY	Bye.  Callie, baby.  Come here.  You really wanna see your mama?

CALLIE	Yes.  I miss her.

NANCY	You do?

CALLIE	Yeah.

NANCY	(soft chuckle)

CALLIE	Is she here?

NANCY	(sighs) No, baby.  Just go on and play.  Okay?

CALLIE	Okay.

NANCY	Go on.

RUTH	(on phone) Hello?

NANCY	Ruth.

RUTH	(on phone) Yes?

NANCY	Listen.  Um, uh, I spoke to Barry.

GAYLE	I want him to come.

VICTORIA	No.

GAYLE	Why is he not good enough?

VICTORIA	Gayle, that boy is not coming to this inauguration.

VICTORIA	Now get dressed, you're distracting me and your father.

GAYLE	To hell with my father.

VICTORIA	Is that what this is about?

GAYLE	Oh.  This is about Leon should be here.

VICTORIA	Oh.  You mean Picky?  The drug dealer?  That boy is gutter trash with a record longer than my train.  We will not allow him.

GAYLE	You know what?

VICTORIA	No.  Tell me.  Please tell me.

JASON	Mom…

VICTORIA	Son, this isn't about you, this is about your sister.  Now, will you please go and get dressed?

GAYLE	I'm not going.

VICTORIA	Oh, yes, you are.  You are the absolute worst, you ungrateful little bitch.  You will not ruin this for me.  You will not!  Look at me.  I will ship your ass off to the farthest place I can find.  You will get dressed now and wear the blue dress, not that green mess you chose.

GAYLE	You don't scare me.

VICTORIA	I'm not trying to.  I'm threatening, you darling.  Real threats.  Do you know how hard it was for me to be taken seriously as his wife?

GAYLE	You're a joke.

VICTORIA	Say that shit again and see if I won't put your head through that wall.  Oh, that's right.  You know I will.  I swear if you embarrass me tonight, it will be the last time your ass is seen in public.

JASON	You okay?

WAITRESS	Yes, sir.

BOBBY	Thank you.

LILLY	Thank you.

BOBBY	You're welcome.  You okay?

LILLY	Yeah.

BOBBY	You know, I'm really sorry about this whole thing.  You seem pretty upset about it.

LILLY	Are--are you just nosy, or…

BOBBY	No.  I just care about people.  That's all.  I'm sorry.  But if it makes you feel any better, I was supposed to be in DC, too.

LILLY	Hmm.  Sorry.

BOBBY	It's okay.  Cheers.  To a better tomorrow.

LILLY	Cheers.

LILLY	Thank you.

BOBBY	Don't mention it.  Do you mind if I sit with you?

LILLY	Um, no.  Yeah, come on over.

JASON	You know, you don't have to follow me every damn where.

VICTORIA	Hello, son.  You look handsome.

JASON	Thanks, Mom.

VICTORIA	Where's your sister?

JASON	She didn't come.

VICTORIA	What?

JASON	Yeah.

VICTORIA	Well then.  Yuma.

YUMA	Yes, Ma'am.  She was taken to the White House.

VICTORIA	I see.  See to it that she doesn't leave until I get there.

YUMA	Yes, Ma'am.

HUNTER	Can we focus on the task at hand, please?

MAX	Sir, I'll show your son where he'll be positioned.

HUNTER	Thank you, Max.

MAX	After you, Sir.

JASON	Why is he following me every damn where?

HUNTER	You know exactly why.

DONALD	This way to the ballroom.

HUNTER	Yeah.

ANNOUNCER	Ladies and gentlemen, the President and First Lady of the United States.

SINGER	You are so beautiful to me.  You are so beautiful to me.  Can't you see you're everything I hoped for?  You're everything I need.  Hey, yeah.  You are so beautiful to nobody but me.

VICTORIA	I hate you, you son of a bitch.

HUNTER	Why?

VICTORIA	You brought your whore.

HUNTER	President gets a plus one.

VICTORIA	Go to hell.

HUNTER	(chuckles)

RICHARD	That's it.  That's the last one.

BARRY	Great.  I'm tired.

RICHARD	(laughs) Come on, sir, you're young.  You can handle it.

BARRY	I'm actually not feeling too young dealing with Ruth, man.

RICHARD	(sighs) Son.

BARRY	Yeah, Dad.  She keeps on coming around.  And I get it, she wants to see Callie, but she is insane.

RICHARD	Oh, no, no.  Listen to me now.  You are doing the right thing for your daughter.

BARRY	Mama doesn't seem to think so.

RICHARD	(scoffs) Well, your mother has compassion for everybody.  (chuckles)

BARRY	I mean, I get compassion, but Ruth is part of a cult and those people are crazy.  Do you know they say that the one they call the--the highest, he's actually married to the young girls.

RICHARD	Hold on.  Wait a minute, son, you don't know that to be true.

BARRY	What I do know is that my daughter will not be around her.

RICHARD	You have custody.  What are you worried about?

MS. ELLE	We've got a problem.

RICHARD	What is it?

MS. ELLE	You'll see.

GAYLE	Ugh, get your hands off of me.

JEAN	(clears throat) Yes, ma'am.

RICHARD	(clears throat) Excuse me, I'm Richard, the Head Butler.

GAYLE	Hmm.  Well, apparently, I'm Gayle, the First Daughter.

RICHARD	Uh, I am aware.

GAYLE	Uh-hmm.

RICHARD	Um, would you like some coffee?

GAYLE	I want a burger.

RICHARD	Okay.  Well, we can get that for you right away.  Uh, this is Jean.  She will be assigned to you.  Can she show you to your room?

JEAN	Yes.

GAYLE	I want him to show me.  Come with me.

RICHARD	Uh, I'm sorry, Ma'am?

GAYLE	You are the butler, right?

RICHARD	Yes.

GAYLE	Okay.  I want him to show me.

RICHARD	Well, Ma'am…

GAYLE	Shut up.  Come on.  Come on.  Which way?  Which way should we be going?  This way, that way?

RICHARD	Go with her, son.  It's okay.  Go with him.

MS. ELLE	And stay close.  Is this what we have to deal with for the next four years?  (sighs)

GAYLE	Wow.  Thanks.  So this is it?

JEAN	Yes, Ma'am.  It is.

GAYLE	I wasn't asking you.  Get out.

JEAN	Ma'am?

GAYLE	Get out.

JEAN	Yes, Ma'am.

GAYLE	Oh, no, no, no.  Not you.

BARRY	Ma'am, I don't--I don't actually work here.

GAYLE	Hmm, well, looks that way to me.

JEAN	Ma'am, I can't…

BARRY	Um, I'm just here helping my father.

GAYLE	That butler?

BARRY	Yes, the butler.

GAYLE	Hmm.  Well, do you want him to keep his job?

BARRY	I'm sorry?

BARRY	Ma'am, no, no, no.  Ma'am, stop.  No, stop it.

GAYLE	Come on.  You don't think I'm sexy?

BARRY	Please, can you stop?  No, can you stop, please?  No.  Uh-uh.  Stop.

GAYLE	Come on.  Let's just play.

BARRY	No, I have to go.  Can you get out my way?

GAYLE	Come on.

BARRY	Stop.

GAYLE	Come on.

BARRY	Stop.

GAYLE	Okay.

BARRY	Stop it.

GAYLE	Come on.

BARRY	I am telling you to stop.  No.  Miss?  Miss?

BOBBY	Oh, no.

LILLY	Of all the days.

BOBBY	Right.

LILLY	Thunderstorms.

BOBBY	Yeah.

LILLY	(laughs)

BOBBY	It's been my week all week, believe it or not.

LILLY	Wow.  Oh, man.

BOBBY	Is that your dad?

LILLY	No.  That's my husband.

BOBBY	Oh.  Sorry.  He's older, yes?

LILLY	How do you know I'm not older and I just look young?

BOBBY	No, you're younger.  My age.  What is he, 70, 80?

LILLY	He's a little bit older than me.  You stop it.

BOBBY	Okay.  Sorry.  Sorry.

LILLY	(chuckles)

BOBBY	I don't like him anyway.

LILLY	You don't know him.

BOBBY	Only what I heard on the phone.

LILLY	So you were listening?

BOBBY	I was just being observant.

LILLY	Well, maybe you should focus on your wife.

BOBBY	I'll do that.  But it is what it is.  Married life.

LILLY	Yeah.  Tell me about it.  (inhales) Hmm.

BOBBY	You know, you're a really beautiful woman.

LILLY	I'm a married woman.

BOBBY	Listen, have you ever just wanted to say, "The hell with it?"  You know, get away, no regrets, no looking back.

LILLY	There are always regrets.

BOBBY	Not always.  You see, sometimes it's just an amazing time.

LILLY	Um…(clears throat) stop.  I'm not that drunk.

BOBBY	You have to be drunk to be made feel good?  I'm heading to the restroom.

LILLY	Wait.  So you're gonna just skip out on the bill?  (scoffs)

BOBBY	No, she has my card.  And besides, the restroom has a changing table for changing kid's diapers.  One room, locked door.  How cool is that?

LILLY	I've never done this before.

LILLY & BOBBY	(moaning)

RUTH	The (indistinct) is god and that's who we worship and who we serve…

NANCY	Come on, Callie.  Hey, it's time for you to get ready for bed now.  Ruth, you got to let her go now.

RUTH	No.

NANCY	Ruth.  You listen to me.  Don't upset her.

RUTH	This is my daughter.

NANCY	And I let you in here to see your child and this is not what we talked about.  Now let her go.

RUTH	No.

NANCY	I said an hour.  It's been two.

RUTH	No.

NANCY	Let her go, Ruth.

RUTH	No.

CALLIE	Mommy, you're hurting me.

NANCY	You are squeezing her too hard.  Come on, baby.

RUTH	This is my baby.

CALLIE	Mama, Grandma.

NANCY	Let her go, damn it.

RUTH	No.

NANCY	Don't…

RUTH	No.

NANCY	Ruth, I will beat your ass in this living room if you don't let her go.

RUTH	I'm sorry but she is coming with me.

NANCY	(grunts) Let her go, damn it.

RUTH	She is.

NANCY	Now I want you to get out of here and don't you ever come back around here again.  Get out.
RUTH	I'm sorry, but I have to do this to you.  The Highest wants this child.  She's special.  He will enlighten me when I bring her.
NANCY	Get out.

RUTH	(indistinct)

NANCY	No, no.  What?

RUTH	Give her to me.

NANCY	No, no.  What are you…

BARRY	Miss.  Jean, Jean.

JEAN	Hey, what's wrong?

BARRY	I don't know.

JEAN	Barry, what…

BARRY	She--she fell and hit her head, uh, and now she's on the ground.

JEAN	Ms. Franklin?  Ms. Franklin?  Ms. Franklin?  Barry, why she is like this?  Why is her skirt hacked up?

BARRY	I don't know.  She came onto me.  She came onto me and then--and she lifted it up.

JEAN	Ma'am?  Ma'am?  Ma'am?  Barry, do not move.  Do not move.

BARRY	No, no, I didn't…

JEAN	Sam, I need you now.  Now.

BARRY	I don't--I didn't do anything, Jean.  I didn't do anything to her.

JEAN	Barry, this is crazy.

BARRY	I didn't--I didn't do it.

JEAN	Ma'am?  Ma'am?

GAYLE	(grunts)

JEAN	Ma'am, are you okay?

GAYLE	Help me.  Help.

JEAN	What?  What?  What?  What?

GAYLE	Help me.  (panting)

JEAN	Ma'am, you're fine.  What are…

GAYLE	He raped me.  He raped me.

JEAN	Barry, don't move.

NANCY	Get out of my house.

NANCY	Help me.  Help me.  No, no.  Help me.

GAYLE	He raped me.

BARRY	No, no, no.

SAM	What?

BARRY	You have that all wrong.  I didn't touch you.

GAYLE	No, you did.

HUNTER	Who the hell do you think you are?

VICTORIA	I'm the Ivy League graduate who married the dumbass All-American farm boy and made President.

LILLY	What the hell are you doing here?

BOBBY	You're so good, Lilly.

LILLY	Get out of my house.

BOBBY	Did you decorate in here?

LILLY	Get out of my house.
