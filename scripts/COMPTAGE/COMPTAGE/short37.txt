(NEAR AND FAR ETIENNE)

THOMAS  	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS  	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS  	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER    	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER    	Etienne had just left the Great Railway Show. He was on his way to catch a boat to France.

STORYTELLER   	But before he went to the docks. Etienne decided that it would be nice to visit London - the capital city of England.

STORYTELLER	Etienne thought about Big Ben and Tower Bridge and all the city lights. 'To London!' Said Etienne. And he raced ahead. 

STORYTELLER	As he got closer to the city, Etienne couldn't wait get to London. 'It won't be long till I see the sights!' He said.

STORYTELLER	Soon Etienne pulled into a station.'Which way to Big Ben!?'  The Station Master pointed into the distance. 'It's over there,' he said. 'You can see the top of it sticking up over the other buildings!'

STORYTELLER	So Etienne headed for Big Ben. But every time he thought he was getting closer... The tracks took him the other away...

STORYTELLER	At last, Etienne ended up back at the same station.

STORYTELLER	'I keep trying to see Big Ben, but the tracks keep taking me away again...'

STORYTELLER	The Station Master looked at a railway map. 'Hmmmm, I can see the problem. None of the tracks go to Big Ben, I don't think a train can go there!' 

STORYTELLER	'But I have come all the way to England. I will never see the sights of London,' 

STORYTELLER 	So, Etienne pulled slowly away. 'I will just go and catch my boat,' Etienne was very sad. 

STORYTELLER	But as Etienne travelled to the coast, he went across a bridge.

STORYTELLER	And as he crossed the bridge, he saw a most wonderful sight... 'Tower bridge and the Tower of London!' 

STORYTELLER	They looked magnificent! Etienne was very happy...

STORYTELLER	The next morning, Etienne arrived at the docks ready to catch his boat home. But he was still thinking about the sights of London and the city lights.

THOMAS  	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
