(THE ADVENTURE CLUB)




Bruno	I believe you have something of mine, Robert.

Robert	It belongs to neither of us, Bruno. Humans shouldn't possess this kind of power.

Bruno	I thought I could have everything I ever wanted for eternity.

Robert	I don't want to live in a world where you can get everything you want.

Bruno	Give me what's mine.

Robert	Sorry, old friend. This is for your own good.

Sandy	Did you get the batteries?

Ricky	Sure did.

Bill	Are you sure this is gonna work?

Ricky	Absolutely. Sandy got all the instructions off the Internet. Right?
 
Sandy	I kinda got all of them off the Internet. I improvised a little.

Bill	A homemade time machine that we found on the Internet. What could possibly go wrong?

Sandy	In the miraculous off chance that this actually works, where should we send him?

Ricky	What about back to prehistoric times? You like dinosaurs, right?

Bill	Sure, I like dinosaurs. It doesn't mean I want to be walking around amongst them. Come to think of it, I'd like to be transported back to last week when I agreed to take part in this stupid experiment.
 
Ricky	Come on, you guys. We're The Adventure Club. This could be the ultimate adventure.

Sandy	Okay, here goes.






Bill	Wait! Did you change the date?

Sandy	Oh, no!

Bill	If I get eaten by T-Rex, I'm gonna be really, really mad at you guys!
 
Ricky	Did it work?

Bill	Nope.

Sandy	I guess we can chalk another bust for The Adventure Club.

Bill	What a surprise.

Ricky	I really had high hopes for this one, guys.
 
Sandy	Maybe we should give up on this whole Adventure Club thing.

Bill	Yeah, maybe we should try something else.

Ricky	Come on, you guys. We can't give up. There's got to be adventures out there for us to have.

Bill	Really? Like the time you tried to convince us that there's a Loch Ness monster living in the lake? Or that there was pirate treasure buried under the school playground? I think it's time to give up the dream. Plus I'm out of Pez, my favourite. Worst day ever. At least I have Penelope.

Sandy	It's really disturbing that you call your jalopy Penelope.

Bill	She's not a jalopy. She's a go-kart. And once I'm finished working on her, she'll be beautiful.

Sandy	Hey, you okay?

Ricky	It's getting late. I better go home.

Jane	I do understand your position, but I don't know if you understand mine. Look, if our funding continues to be cut, we won't have any money to bring any new exhibits in and it will be impossible to the Science Museum to turn a profit. It's a vicious cycle. Yes. Yes, I understand. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

Martin	Well, that didn't sound good.

Jane	No. Hey, sweetheart. Where have you been?

Ricky	Just hanging out. Hey, Martin.

Martin	Hey, buddy.




Ricky	Everything okay, Mom?
 
Jane	Oh yeah, just some Science Museum stuff. You ready for some dinner? Martin made lasagne.

Martin	Yeah, and I made it, not your mom.

Jane	What is that supposed to mean?

Martin	Nothing, dear.

Ricky	No, thanks.

Martin	Are you sure? It's not just any lasagne. It's mac-and-cheese lasagne.

Ricky	I'm not hungry.

Jane	I'll be right back. Hey, sweetie. Are you okay? Can I see? Aw. I haven't seen that in a long time.

Ricky	Mom, do you think Grandpa really went on all those adventures?

Jane	Oh yeah. He was an archaeologist, sweetheart. He travelled all over the world.

Ricky	I miss how he'd give me a wet willy every time I'd see him.

Jane	You used to hate those wet willies.

Ricky	I miss them now.

Jane	I know. You were his favourite. He used to always say that one of his most favourite days, ever, was the day that you were born.

Ricky	Do you think I could ever be like him?

Jane	Oh, Ricky, you already are like him.

Ricky	I mean, like, going on adventures and stuff.

Jane	Do you remember what granddad used to always say, that the key to adventure is always right in front of you.

Ricky	Is the Science Museum going to close down?

Jane	I don't know, but it doesn't look good. We need to come up with a lot of money before the end of the month.


Ricky	Grandpa would be sad to hear that. He was the founder of that place.

Jane	Yes, he was. But you know what? I don't want you to worry, because I have a town hall meeting this week and I'm gonna do my very best to convince the municipality to do what's right. So, I need to you to say a wish for your dear, old mama, okay? 'Cause I'm gonna need it. It's time for you to go to bed now. I want you to come brush your teeth, okay? Baby. I'm proud of you.
 
Ricky	The key. The key to adventure is right in front of me.
 
Martin	Who's there? Ricky, you scared me. I thought you were a burglar. What are you doing up here?

Ricky	Uh, nothing. Just couldn't sleep.

Martin	Okay. Well, good night.
 
Ricky	Clubhouse meeting, first thing tomorrow.

Sandy	Roger.

Bill	Copy that.

Ricky	I’m telling you, guys-this is it. This is the one we've been waiting for.
 
Bill	Like we haven't heard that before.

Ricky	No, this time it's different.

Bill	Every time you say it's different.

Ricky	But this time it really is.

Bill	You say that every time too.

Sandy	I'm sorry, Ricky, but I'm gonna have to take Bill's side on this one. Adventure Club rules. You have to have a majority.

Ricky	Just hear me out. I found this hidden in my grandpa's old desk. Why would he go to the trouble of hiding this if it wasn't something really special? And I'm the one who found it. Don't you see? It's like he left it for me. I've got a good feeling about this one, guys.

Sandy	It's not that we don't want to believe you, but--

Bill	We don't believe you.

Ricky	Please, guys, just give me this one, at least for this one last time. And if this turns out to be a bust, I promise I'll let it go. Forever.

Bill	Fine!

Sandy	I wanna see the map.

Ricky	You guys are the best.

Sandy	Well, this is a map all right. But it's not of streets. It looks like some kind of old-fashioned blueprints for a building.

Bill	How do we find out what building this is from?

Sandy	Hey, look. The architect's name is written here.

Bill	Shayne Putzlocher? That's a mouthful.

Sandy	I've got an idea.

Bill	This is way too much like school.

Sandy	Take a seat. I'll be right back. Putzlocher... Putzlocher... Putzlocher... Ah, Putzlocher. Shayne Putzlocher, architect. Uh, "By 1964 the Power Corporation purchased the powerhouse...”Uh…ah. “The legacy of The Powerhouse Building was preserved as--"

Bill	The Science Museum! Our Science Museum, right here in town.

Ricky	Of course. My grandpa was the key founder of the Science Museum.

Bill	That probably means whatever this key unlocks is in that building.

Sandy	And these blueprints are for the Science Museum.

Curtis	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, easy there, kids. Did you not see the sign that says "No run-ning." Where do you think you are, an amusement park? Don't answer that, son. That's a rhetorical question. You are in a museum of science, a hallowed institution for learned people. You have to respect this establishment.

Bill	Wow. That's a lot of equipment you got there.

Curtis	I'm in security, son. You always gotta be prepared.
 
Sandy	You're insecure?

Curtis	What? No.

Ricky	Curtis, it's me, Ricky. You remember? My mom works here.

Curtis	Oh, I see. You're one of those.

Ricky	One of…?

Curtis		One of those kids who thinks they get a free pass in life. That's your generation. My generation had to grow up way faster than yours. You don't know what it's like to have to pay your dues. Speaking of, you gotta pay the $7.50 admission charge.

Jane	Ricky! Hey, kids, what a nice surprise.

Ricky	Yeah, we thought we'd come by and check out some of the new exhibits.

Jane	Well, I'm very happy to hear that. Curtis, you can let them through.

Curtis	Certainly, ma'am.

Jane	Come on.

Curtis	The youth of today.

Sandy	What's that?

Jane	That is a gyro sphere. It's a tool that astronauts use to prepare for space flight.

Bill	Cool!
 
Jane	Yeah, you may think so, but you will not catch me anywhere near that thing. Just looking at it throws me off my equilibrium.

Ricky	My mom hates any kind of amusement park ride. Remember what happened when we were at Wonderland and I convinced you to go on the space coaster with me?

Jane	Sweetheart, we don't talk about that.

Ricky	Barf-o-rama.

Jane	I heard that. All right, listen, I've got to get back to work. You guys have fun, okay?

Sandy	Okay.

Jane	I'm so glad you're here.

Ricky	Bye, Mom.
 
Jane	Bye, sweetie, enjoy.

Sandy	Okay, let's put these blueprints to use and see what we can find.

Bill	Um, so what are we looking for?

Ricky	There has to be something. Come on, grandpa. What is it? What's this over here?

Sandy	A room. Uh, according to this it's…below us on the main level.

Ricky	I've been here a thousand times and there's no room there.
 
Sandy	You're right. There's no room here. These blueprints show the exact layout of this entire building,…and according to this there should be a room right here.

Bill	Why would a room be walled off?

Ricky	Because it's a secret room. It all makes sense. Where else would you keep a hidden treasure but in a secret room?

Bill	How do we get in there?

Ricky	I don't know. We can't just do it in the middle of the day.

Bill	What are you saying? We break in? Because that's illegal, and I don't know about you guys, but I can't go to jail. For starters, I'm claustrophobic and I look terrible in orange.

Sandy	We don't need to break in. Ricky's mom works here.

Sandy	He can just borrow the security key.

Bill	I'm not a lawyer, but this distinctly sounds like something that would land us in deep trouble if we get caught.

Sandy	Then we don't get caught.

Ricky	The museum closes at 7. Let's meet here just before 8 p.m.

Sandy	Done.

Bill	Fine!

Jane	All right, boys. I did the cooking tonight so get ready to enjoy.

Ricky	What'd you make, Mom?

Jane	Paella. I think.

Martin	Oh.

Jane	You know, sweetie, It was really nice to see you guys today. You haven't been coming down lately.

Ricky	We thought we'd just pass by for a visit.

Martin	I was surprised you had the energy.


Jane	Why?

Martin	No reason.

Jane	Okay, you know what? Don't gang up on me.

Ricky	It's okay. You can tell her.

Jane	Tell me what?

Martin	I woke up in the middle of the night and I found this guy rummaging around the den.

Jane	Really?

Martin	Yeah.

Jane	And what where you doing up there?

Ricky	I was just looking through some of grandpa's old things.

Martin	Did you find anything cool?

Ricky	Yeah, I did.

Jane	He's convinced that his granddad wasn't just an archeologist, but an incredible explorer that found magical artifacts.

Martin	Like Dr. Jones.

Ricky	Exactly like Dr. Jones.

Jane	Grandpa is not Dr. Jones.

Ricky	He was too! : I found something last night of his that will prove everyone wrong.

Jane	Well, you are definitely your granddad's grandson, that's for sure.

Martin	So, what'd you find?

Ricky	I don't know yet, but something big. I can feel it.

Jane	All right, Mr. Tall Teller of Tales, that's enough. I want to enjoy this delicious dinner. Dig in. I'll order pizza.

Martin	Yeah.

Jane	Okay, I guess you should stick to the cooking from now on.

Martin	Don't beat yourself up. Paella is a tough one.

Jane	It is.

Martin	Start with something simpler.

Jane	Like toast.

Martin	Your toast usually involves the fire alarm, so yeah, maybe you were right. Maybe I should stick to the cooking from now on.

Jane	You're terrible.

Martin	No, I'm serious. I'm happy to be the domestic one. You're the business woman.

Jane	For the moment. I have no doubt that you are going to be the hottest real estate agent around in no time at all.

Martin	Well, let's hope so. It's hard to adjust to a new town.

Jane	Well, you're not on the mean streets of Cleveland anymore. And we prairie folk, we take a while to warm up to people.

Martin	Really? 'Cause I seem to recall winning you over pretty quickly.

Jane	Well, there's always an exception to the rule.
 
Martin	Lucky for me.

Jane	He really likes you.

Martin	Who, Ricky? He's a great kid.

Jane	He is. And you're a great guy. And this feels really nice.

Martin	What?

Jane	Like we're a family.

Martin	I feel like some ice cream. Do you want some ice cream? Let's have some ice cream.

Jane	Sure.

Martin	Hey.

Ricky	Hey.

Martin	I'm gonna get some ice cream.

Ricky	Cool.

Martin	You know, it looks like we're out of ice cream. I'll pick some up.

Jane	Really? I could have sworn there was-Martin? Martin?

Langley	All the world's a stage, and all the men and women play their parts. There are exits. There are entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts. Hi. You know, when I ran the drama club at the state pen, I fell in love with the craft of acting. I did. I just, I went nuts for it. When an actor really gets into his part, it is-- it just, it gave me goosebumps. Kinda like what I'm getting from you, right now, watching you. But you went to like a whole other level. You, you've gone method, my friend.

Martin	What are you talking about, Langley?

Langley	You're really falling for her, aren't you? What's her name? That Jane.

Martin	I have not fallen for her.

Langley	I hope not 'cause that would really endanger our mission, wouldn't it?

Martin	What are you doing here? I didn't even know you were out of prison yet.

Langley	Yeah, I know. I'm not supposed to be, but somehow I found a way. I had to check up on you. I had to make sure that you were still following through with our deal.

Martin	Of course I'm following through with our deal!

Langley	You do not get snippy with me! Remember, I took the fall. I went to prison. You got to go free. Please. You owe me.

Martin	I did--

Langley	You owe me. You owe me. And I will rat on you.

Martin	You're right. I'm sorry.

Langley	So? What news?

Martin	The kid found something, said it belonged to his grandfather.

Langley	His grandfather?

Martin	I'll find out more information.

Langley	Well, good. You better because that thing is priceless. Remember? My father spent his whole life trying to get it back and he died in squalor, begging for assistance from anyone. I'm not goin' like that.
 
Martin	I'm on it.

Langley	I hope so, 'cause I'd hate to recast you. So, um, I wanna take it back again. Not from the top, though, from that last line, your last line. "I'm on it." 'Cause I didn't really believe it and I wanna feel it. Will you try it again for me?

Martin	I'm on it.

Langley	Okay, I like underplay too, but that was like really throwin' it away. How about just like something with a little more feeling, …a little more bang.

Martin	I'm on it!
 
Langley	We're gonna have old ladies with hearing aids. They're not gonna be able to hear you as they come in. They'll say, "what's he saying? I don't know."

Martin	I'm on it!

Langley	Guess what, we got a back row. They're not gonna hear a thing.

Martin	I'm on it!

Langley	Don't you feel that? That is crazy. Goosebumps. And scene.

Sandy	You got the key, right?

Ricky	Yep. Ricky: Let's do this. It's not working.

Sandy	Maybe it's the other way around. Let me see it. This is a yoga membership card.

Ricky	It is?

Bill	Dude, you've gotta be kidding me!

Ricky	They both look very similar. I was in a rush.

Bill	You had one job! Well, I guess we have to go home now.

Sandy	Not yet.

Bill	What?

Ricky	What's that?

Sandy	It's a key code descrambler I've been working on. Found the instructions online. Thought it might come in handy when we're late for school and they lock us out.

Bill	Does it work?

Sandy	I don't know. Right this way, gentlemen.

Ricky	Nice save, Sandy.  Curtis goes on his rounds at the top of every hour. Which is right... now. We have to be in and out in 30 minutes.
 
Sandy	Psst! So, how do we open it?

Bill	I've got an idea. Open sesame! What? Sometimes it's the most obvious thing that works.

Sandy	Well, there's got to be a lever or a switch or something.

Bill	Well, at least we tried, right? Let's go home.

Ricky	There's definitely something behind here.

Sandy	Hm, that's pretty cool. You're like royalty around here.

Ricky	Key. The key to adventure is right in front of you.

Bill	We're not going in there...Are we?

Ricky	This is the point of no return.

Sandy	Well, then I guess we'd better get going.

Bill	And how is this a good idea? What is this thing?
 
Sandy	I don't know. I think it's an elevator. Where are we going?

Ricky	I don't know. This must be my grandpa's clubhouse. Just like the one we have.

Bill	Do you know the combination?

Sandy	It's gotta be a significant number for your grandfather. Do you know his birthday?

Ricky	It's May 21st, but I don't know the year.

Bill	What was it?

Ricky	…09, 29, 05, my birthday. It's just a wooden box.

Bill	That's it? A wooden box? That's why we broke the law this evening?

Ricky	"True wishes are granted from within."

Sandy	What do you think it is?

Ricky	I don't know. We better get going.

Bill	Stealing? We're stealing now? Oh great, another crime!

Curtis	Hm. Hm.

Sandy	We're clear. That was close.

Ricky	There's got to be more to this.

Sandy	Well, it has to be something important. Otherwise it wouldn't have been hidden away like that.

Ricky	And this note.

Bill	What does it mean?

Ricky	I don't know, but I know who might.

Bill	Do you think he's even here?

Ricky	Of course he's here. He's always here.

Sandy	Where else would he be?

Ricky	Cool.

Sandy	Ozzie, you in here?

Ozzie	Hello? Well. Well, well, well, well. Well, well, well, well. Well. It's the Adventure Club in the flesh.

Ricky	Bam. Sandy to Ozzie: Bam. Bill to Ozzie: Bam. Ozzie to kids: Bam. All: Pshhh! Zing.

Sandy	Zing. 

Bill	Zing.

Ozzie	Zing.

All	Adventure Club!

Ozzie	So, good to see you guys. To what do I owe the honour of this little visit? Can I guess? You want to get a gift. You need the perfect present for the perfect person who has perfectly everything from this perfect store.

Sandy	It is the perfect store. This is our favourite shop.

Ozzie	I know. You're my favourites, my best customers. I mean people today, kids--kids! They're so invested in those videogames. They don't appreciate old- fashioned knickknacks like I got here. And smart phones, don't get me started. Don't. Please don't. My heart, I can't. Dumb phones. Dumb phones. They should be called dummy phoneys.

Ricky	Ozzie-

Ozzie	Yeah?

Ricky	We need your help.

Ozzie	Of course you do. I'm all ear. Fire away.

Sandy	What do you know about boxes?

Ozzie	What do I know about boxes? Like what, like a toy box, like a shoebox, like a tack box, like a toolbox, like a Jack-in- the-box, like I-could- go-on-forever-box box? I need more specifics?

Ricky	What about an ancient box that was locked away in a safe with this note?

Ozzie	That looks really old, Ricky. Where did you get that parchment? Ricky? Hm, you know what? This could be pertaining to a wish box.

Bill	A wish box?

Ozzie	Oh yeah! Bill, they are extremely, extremely rare.

Sandy	What is it?

Ozzie	Follow me, kids. Wish boxes, wish boxes, wish boxes. I mean, kids, you know what? I recall that they were magical devices first used by Sumerian fortune tellers in ancient Mesopotamia. And I know you kids know that's where the cradle of civilization started, right? That's where the term "genie in the bottle" originated. Found it.

Bill	Come on, Ozzie, over here.

Ozzie	Okay, table of contents. Oh my gosh, 143, 143, 143, 143. Hang on a minute. Okay, hang on. Ready? Here it is. "In ancient times magic wish boxes were believed to grant wishes to whomever was fortunate enough to find it and lay hands upon it. Once you had touched the wish box, you were given three wishes. “These wishes were allowed by simply writing it onto a piece of paper and dropping it into the box. Any wish, no matter how outlandish. “The only catch is wishes will only be granted to the pure of heart." That's a bummer. I can't imagine too many wishes being granted if that's true. Right? "During the time in which a person or persons are owed their wishes, another party cannot use the wish box unless the possessor wishes the box to be transferred." Oh, wow. Even in ancient times they had legalese. Isn't history just so amazing, you guys? Okay, why? What? Why? What is the meaning of the interest in this matter?

Ricky	No reason, really. Just idle curiosity.

Ozzie	Hm. Well. You know what? If I ever found something that possessed the power of being able to grant three wishes, I'm pretty certain I'd put that box back to where I found it and I would turn around and run or bike away as fast as I could.

Bill	But, why?

Ozzie	Because, Billy, they're so powerful. Wish boxes are so powerful. I've read about it. I know about this. They possess-- they turn people's minds into crazy, crazy, crazy greed, and greed and want and want. Oh, and there are people out there that will stop at nothing to get their hands on one.

Ricky	Thanks, Ozzie.

Ozzie	Peace, kids.

Ricky	A magical wish box?

Seth	A magical what?

Sandy	It's none of your business.

Seth	Well, I'm gonna make it my business.

Ozzie	Seth, scram.

Seth	Hey, chill out, Ozzie. I was just coming by to pick up some old comics.

Ozzie	Well, not until you pay for the ones you “picked up” before.

Seth	We'll continue this another time.

Ozzie	Hey, my three Adventure Clubbers, remember everything I said. Ride safe.

Ricky	Thanks, Ozzie.

Ozzie	Okay.

Sandy	Well, I guess we should meet up tomorrow night to get the wish box back into the Science Museum.

Bill	Sounds good.
 
Ricky	Wait. Wait, you guys. We can't just give up now.

Sandy	What? What about what Ozzie said?

Ricky	Ozzie is a grownup. He's being overly cautious. You know how adults can get.

Bill	I don't know, dude. I don't want to get in trouble.

Sandy	Me neither.

Ricky	But, that's the risk that every great adventurer takes, and that's who we are.

Bill	We're not great adventurers. We're just kids.

Ricky	Do you know what happens if we give up now? We become just like everybody else out there, living boring, normal lives. One day we'll probably end up like that. But let's not give in just yet. Right now this is our one chance to be different. We could do something great with it. Like save the Science Museum. We grew up going to that place our whole lives. It's gave us so much. This is an opportunity to give something back. Besides, aren't you curious?

Sandy	So, three wishes are granted to whoever discovers the box.
 
Ricky	But we all found it. We touched it at the same time. That means we only have three wishes between us, one each.

Sandy	So, we shouldn't waste one.

Bill	I agree. But we need to know if this thing actually works, right? I don't mind using up mine. You know me, always willing to take one for the team.

Sandy	Okay. What are you gonna wish for?

Bill	Something realistic, not too crazy. You know, a starter wish. I've got it! A lifetime supply of Pez.

Ricky	You know, for a guy who can come up with some pretty terrible ideas? Every now and then you come up with a brilliant one.

Bill	Okay, here it goes. It didn't work.

Sandy	Give it a moment. Maybe it takes some time.

Ricky	Anything?

Bill	Nothing yet.

Ricky	Anything yet?

Bill	Nothing.

Ricky	How about now?

Bill	Still nothing. What a rip-off.
 
Ricky	Doesn't make sense. Why would my grandpa hide something away that doesn't work?

Sandy	Maybe there's an expiry date or something.

Bill	I gotta get home. I'm late for dinner. Uh, Ricky.

Ricky	Yeah, go for Ricky.

Bill	Uh, I think it worked! Ha! Oh, Pez, Pez for life! Pez! Pez! Oh, I love it! I love it! I love it!

Martin	Hey, don't you want breakfast?

Ricky	No, thanks. Gotta go.

Jane	Oh, Ricky. Ricky! Ricky. Ricky. Ricky, wait! Listen, sweetheart, I am giving my speech to the municipality tonight for the Science Museum, and it would really mean so much to me if you were there, okay?

Ricky	Sure.

Jane	Slow down!

Bill	Can you believe it?

Ricky	Nope.
 
Sandy	What did you do with all of it?

Bill	I ate a lot of it. It was good. The rest I hid in my closet and under my bed. I figured if my parents ask, I'll tell them that I entered a contest and won.

Ricky	Do you guys realize what this means?

Bill	Yeah, Pez for life!

Rick	It means the wish box works.

Seth	We meet again, dorkuses.

Sandy	That's not the plural of dorkus. It's dorki.
 
Seth	Shutup, brainy. I guess your pal Ozzie isn't here to save you this time. It's on. Sorry, I don't fight girls.

Sandy	How unfortunate.

Ricky	Why are you doing this, Seth?

Seth	Because I'm sick of you science geeks and your dumb Adventure Club.

Sandy	We never invited you to be a part of it.

Seth	Exactly.
 
Bill	I've got a bad feeling about this.

Jane	Martin.

Martin	Oh! Hi. You startled me.

Jane	What are you doing in here?

Martin	I was just looking for my laptop. Yeah, I lent it to Ricky and I thought he might have left it in here.

Jane	Oh, he probably left it in his room. I can check.

Martin	No, no! No. That's fine. I can do that. Thanks, sweetie.
 
Jane	No problem.

Martin	See ya.

Jane	Yeah.

Bill	I think this has just been one big, unfortunate misunderstanding. Why don't we take this opportunity to start fresh? Can I offer you a complimentary package of Pez? As a peace offering. Never mind.
 
Ricky	If you have a plan to get out of this, now would be an excellent time to execute.

Bill	Nothing really coming to mind.

Seth	Enough of this dancing, loser. What are you doing? Let me down! Let me down! Ahhahaha! Ahahahah!

Bill	Are you doing that?

Ricky	No, I thought you were.

Seth	What are you doing. Let me down!

Langley	It’s real.

Seth	Ah! Let me down! Ah!

Sandy	I hope you guys didn't mind me using another wish.

Bill	Mind? That was awesome!

Ricky	Wait, that was your wish you used up... for me?

Sandy	That's what friends do.

Bill	We can't keep carrying this thing around with us. It's too dangerous. We should leave it in a place where it's gonna be safe.

All	The clubhouse!

Langley	Hey, kid. You know, I think we can help each other out.

Seth	Who are you?

Langley	Let's just say I'm the guy who understands your situation. You don't have many friends 'cause you got a bad rap for being a bully when really you were the one who's excluded and was misunderstood. And I know exactly how you feel. Trust me, I was just like you. Now, you wanna get back at your friends for what they did to you? I can help you do that.

Jane	Hey.

Martin	You okay?

Jane	I'm okay. I'm trying not to be nervous.

Martin	You're gonna be fine. You'll be great.

Jane	Have you seen Ricky?

Martin	No, but he'll be here. Don't worry.

Jane	Okay.

Martin	Hey. Go get 'em.

Jane	Thank you. I'm gonna get started. Hello, everyone, my name is Jane Young and I'm the director of the Science Museum. First of all I want to thank you all so much for being here. As many of you know, there has been major cutbacks to our school systems and that is one of the reasons, one of the reasons why it is so important to keep a place like the Science Museum open. It is one of the last places that our children can come to learn and be inspired and have fun.

Man	Ms. Young. Jane to Man: Yes. It simply makes no sense to keep this failed institution open. An institution, I might add, that is costing the hardworking taxpayers of this community hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year. My development, it's going to bring jobs and prosperity back to these good people.

Jane	All right, everyone, please, if you could just—

Bill	Imagine what we could do if we had more wishes. I'd wish to have a roller coaster in my backyard. No! I'd wish to have my own drive-in movie theatre in my backyard. No, wait. I'd wish to have my own spaceship in my backyard. Yep, definitely a spaceship.

Sandy	I'd wish for straight A pluses.

Bill	You already have straight A pluses.

Sandy	Right. Then I'd wish to be the President of Mensa.

Ricky	I'd wish to have one more day with my grandpa. Just one more. That would be awesome.

Bill	This wish box is like having absolute power.

Ricky	Maybe it's not such a good thing.

Bill	What do you mean?

Ricky	How does that old saying go?

Sandy	Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Ricky	Yeah, that one. I'm thinking my grandpa hid this thing away for a reason.

Sandy	I agree. Maybe Ozzie was right after all. We should put it back.

Bill	Whoa, whoa! Let's not get crazy here.

Sandy	We could have done anything with this wish box, but instead what did we use it for? For candy and to get revenge on a bully.

Bill	Both very valid and necessary things. Let's be reasonable. After all, Ricky hasn't gotten to use his wish yet. You should use yours before we give it back. Seems only fair.

Ricky	Fine. But I wanna wish for something that's not selfish, something to help other people, that's good for society.

Bill	Boring.

Ricky	Okay fine, what should it be?

Sandy	Like you said before, use it to help save the Science Museum.

Ricky	Oh no! The Science Museum.

Martin	Well, that guy was quite the charmer, wasn't he?
 
Jane	Well, the municipality is leaning his way, that's for sure. But they haven't made their decision yet. I've still got time. You know, I have the fundraiser coming up. I know that's a long shot, but I've got to try.

Martin	You're amazing. You just never give up, do you?

Jane	I don't really have a choice.

Langley	Jane? Jane. Michael Langley, do you remember me?

Jane	Michael?

Langley	No beard, remember me now?

Jane	Michael, what a surprise. It's been years.
 
Langley	Yeah.

Jane	How are you?

Langley	Great, I'm really good. I just saw you speak. That was amazing. She was amazing. Did you see that?

Martin	Yeah.

Langley	You did, right?

Jane	Thank you. What are you doing in town?

Langley	I'm just visiting, yeah.

Jane	Well, you've been away for so long.

Langley	Yeah, I have. So what? You're the director of the Science Museum?

Jane	I am.

Langley	Wow. That's just, that's incredible. That's great.

Jane	Thank you.

Langley	I should come by for like a private tour or something. I love science.

Jane	Oh, well I'm happy to hear that. Please do. I'm so sorry. Michael, this is Martin. Michael.

Langley	Hey, how are you. Nice to meet you.

Martin	Hi.

Langley	Wow, that's a cool jacket. Look at all those pockets. A fella could hide a lot in there, huh?

Jane	I'm sorry. Would you mind excusing me for a moment?

Martin	Sure.

Jane	Okay, nice to see you.

Langley	Really good to see you. It's been so long. It's great to see you.

Jane	Okay, bye-bye, Michael. I'll see you.

Martin	See you soon.

Jane	Okay, dear.

Langley	I'll come by for sure.

Jane	Okay, bye-bye.

Martin	What the heck are you doing?

Ricky	I'm sorry I wasn't here, Mom. Are you mad?

Jane	No, sweetheart, I'm not mad.

Langley	That's what you get when you send a boy to do a man's job.

Martin	No, no, that is not necessary. I have this handled.

Langley	Have it handled? Did you find it?

Martin	No.

Langley	Exactly.

Jane	It would have been really nice for you to be here. Okay, I'll see you at home, okay? I've got a bit of work to do.

Ricky	I feel so bad for letting my mom down like that.

Sandy	Well, we can use the last wish to save the Science Museum.

Bill	But how? We can't just wish for a million bucks.

Sandy	We'll figure something out. Hey, somebody's been here!

Ricky	We’ve been compromised.

Bill	By who?

Seth	Haha! See you later, dorkuses!

Ricky	Who else? Seth.
 
Sandy	Do you think he knows about the wish box?

Ricky	Well, after what happened in the park today, he's got to be suspicious of something. We should follow and find out what he knows.

Bill	What? The guy who nearly beat us into oblivion? You want to follow him? And how is that a good idea?

Martin	Why did you call me here? You can't keep ordering me around like this.

Langley	I can do anything I want. I own you. Besides, I want you to meet someone.

Martin	Who?

Langley	Your replacement. Apparently I did need a boy to do a man's job. [laughs]

Bill	Looks like a back alley business meeting if I ever saw one. Though I never have, except in movies.
 
Ricky	What's Martin doing here? That's the guy I saw talking to my mom.

Bill	Who is that guy?

Sandy	I don't know, but I don't like the looks of him.

Martin	What are you gonna do?

Langley	You never mind what I'm gonna do. Beat it.

Martin	If you do anything to hurt her, I swear I will--

Langley	If you don't want anything to happen to her, then you better stay out of my way. Get outta my way. Get outta my way, man. I’m tryin' to get to my car. Why are you in my way? Still in my way.
 
Martin	Can you stop it, please.

Ricky	Okay, this is weird. First Seth finds the clubhouse, then Martin is meeting with Seth and some strange guy. Something's going on.

Sandy	One thing's for sure, we can't let anybody get their hands on the wish box.

Ricky	I've got an idea. Ozzie, you down here?

Ozzie	Yeah, in the back. Hi.

Ricky	Ozzie, we need your help.

Ozzie	Sure, I'm at your service.

Ricky	We need something from you.

Ozzie	Does this have anything to do at all with what we talked about the other day?

Ricky	Yes. I'm sorry. We should have listened to you.

Sandy	But you have to trust us, Ozzie.

Bill	We promise we'll make it right.

Ozzie	Promise?

Kids	Promise.

Ozzie	Cross your heart?
 
Kids	Cross our hearts.

Ozzie	Double, double, double pinky swear?

Kids	Double, double, double pinky swear.

Ozzie	I'm in. What can I do for ya?

Ricky	Thanks, Ozzie. And I'd also like to make a purchase.

Jane	Everything okay, guys?

Ricky	Yep. Martin to Jane: Yep.

Jane	Yeah? You gonna be all right if I leave you tonight? I've got to go back to the Science Museum to finish some stuff up for the fundraiser tomorrow.

Martin	We'll be fine.

Jane	Yeah? Martin to Jane: Yeah. Jane to Ricky: Ricky? Ricky to Jane: Yeah. Okay. All right. Clean up when you're finished, okay, sweetie? I'll see you later.

Ricky	Okay. Bye, Mom.

Jane	Bye.

Jane	Bye, sweetie.

Martin	Bye.

Ricky	How was work today?

Martin	Work was fine. Work was fine.

Ricky	You didn't happen to be downtown, did you?

Martin	As a matter of fact, I was. Yeah, I had a meeting with a guy. He's thinking about selling his house. Why?

Ricky	No reason.

Martin	Smart kid.

Jane	Hey, what's going on?

Martin	We need to talk.

Jane	Okay. About anything in particular?

Martin	I need to tell you that--

Jane	Martin, it's okay. What is it?

Martin	I just-- I wanted to tell you how much I care about you.

Jane	Oh, good. Good. I care about you too.

Martin	Okay, great.

Jane	Are you okay? You've been acting a little funny lately.

Martin	Yeah, no, I'm-I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

Jane	Okay, good. You're so sweet. I'll see ya tonight.

Martin	Okay.
 
Jane	Okay, bye.

Martin	All right.

Jane	You're funny.

Martin	See ya.

Langley	Hey, Jane. Say “science.”

Jane	Science.  Michael! You scared me.

Langley	I’m sorry. I know.

Jane	What are you doing here?

Langley	Well, I came because of the tour that you promised me.

Jane	Oh no, Michael, look, we’re actually just about to close.

Langley	That is so awesome! We have the place to ourselves. That’s great.

Ricky	He fell for it. Let’s meet at the clubhouse.

Bill	Copy, on my way.

Sandy	Copy, see you there.

Jane	I’m sorry, Mike, but I really think it’d be better if you came back tomorrow.

Langley	Tomorrow. I can’t come back tomorrow. Tonight’s the only night I can do this.

Curtis	Everything okay here, Ms. Young?

Langley	Hold on a second. Do me a favour. Take one.

Jane	Oh, goodness. All right.

Langley	That’s—You’re kidding me. You got two pairs of handcuffs. That is awesome. And a taser. That is just – it’s like Christmas for me.
 
Jane	Oh, I’m so happy, Michael. It’s–

Langley	You’ll understand that soon enough.

Ricky	Martin’s in on it. I saw him take the bag.

Sandy	Oh, Ricky, I’m so sorry.

Ricky	We’ve got to use the last wish to save the Science Museum before it’s too late.

Seth	It’s already too late.

Curtis	It’s my duty to serve and protect this institution and I have—

Langley	Don’t beat yourself up. You can’t win every game. Now look—Yeah, I’m gonna borrow that, all right? Thanks. Is it true that you have a gyrosphere here? Let’s go see it. Don’t go away.

Seth	I guess this proves you losers aren’t much of an adventure club after all.

Ricky	Seth, don’t do this. You’re not one of the bad guys.

Seth	Who said I was?

Ricky	I’m sorry we never included you in our club.

Seth	I never wanted to be a part of your stupid club.

Ricky	Yes, you did. And we didn’t include you, so for that I’m sorry.

Seth	I don’t care. Take care of their bikes.

Ricky	Forget it. Let’s just go on foot.
 
Bill	No, wait. I’ve got an idea.

Jane	Langley, what are you doing?

Langley	Well, I can’t tie you to the train tracks. They’re clear across town. And the hero enters riding on his hipster jeans.
 
Martin	Okay, Langley, you win. You take this and get the heck outta here.

Jane	You two know each other?

Langley	Oh yeah, we go way back. You wanna explain?

Jane	Martin, what is going on?

Langley	Yeah, Martin, what’s going on? Why don’t you explain it to her ‘cause I’m too busy destroying the fake wish box. Really? You think I’m that stupid to fall for that silly trick? And here I thought you had such potential as a criminal.

Jane	Criminal?

Martin	I’m sorry. I tried to tell you.

Jane	What, so was everything just a lie?

Martin	No, no, not everything. I promise you. You’re never gonna get away with this.

Langley	What do you mean? I already have. What do you think my first wish is?

Martin	What?

Langley	To get away with it. Criminal genius. It’s kinda my jam.

Martin	But you don’t even have the real wish box.

Langley	Oh, don’t I? Oh, god, I just love this kid’s timing. It’s impeccable. What do we got?

Sandy	You know what? Penelope ain’t so bad.

Langley	Yeah! Nice.

Seth	Uh, Mr. Langley, sir?

Langley	Yeah?

Seth	I was just wondering if you were gonna follow through on your end of the deal.

Langley	What exactly is my end of the deal?

Seth	You promised me one of your wishes if I helped you.

Langley	No, I didn’t.

Seth	Yes, you did.

Langley	No, I didn’t. Look, well, if I did, I lied. Just chalk it up to a valuable lesson in a life of crime. Now, beat it.

Ricky	You guys wait here. I’ve got this.

Sandy	Are you sure?

Ricky	Yeah. It’s my wish. I’ve got to take care of this myself.

Sandy	Good luck.

Bill	Go get ‘em, Ricky!

Langley	Now we’re talking. Phase one of my master plan. It’s not working. Why isn’t it working? What’s wrong with this thing? Why isn’t it working?

Ricky	Because you forgot one very important detail.

Jane	Ricky. You brought Ricky into this?

Langley	You brought Ricky into this?

Ricky	The box only grant wishes to the pure of heart.

Langley	Come on, man, the pure of heart? Enough with the fairy tale crap. Really?

Ricky	Mom, are you okay?

Jane	Yes, sweetheart, I’m fine.

Ricky	I still have one last wish granted to me. And I’m willing to make a deal. I’ll agree to wish for you to have unlimited wishes, giving you complete control over the box.

Martin	Be careful, Ricky.

Langley	Hold on a minute. What are your terms?

Ricky	I only have one condition. You free my mom and let us go forever.

Langley	That’s two conditions.

Martin	Think about it, Langley. Anything you’ve ever wanted for eternity.
 
Langley	All right, you have a deal. But I wanna see you write it down with my own eyes.

Ricky	Fair enough.

Langley	No, I want to dictate it. That way I’m sure that the wording is correct. “I hereby wish for Michael Carruthers—don’t say it—Langley, to have unlimited wishes for all time in perpetuity.” That’s p-e-r-p—
 
Ricky	I got it. Satisfied?

Langley	Yes, very. All right, come on. Let’s get on with this shindig.

Ricky	Give me the keys to the cuffs first.

Langley	No, make the wish first.

Ricky	You think I’m stupid?

Langley	No, I don’t. It’s really just— Smart kid. Hey, that—Hey! Hey, hey!

Jane	Ricky! How did you do this?

Ricky	Disappearing ink. Good ol’ Ozzie came through again.

Langley	That wish box is mine!

Ricky	That wish box doesn’t belong to anyone. No human should possess this kind of power.

Langley	Which is exactly why I should have it. God, you are your grandfather’s grandson.

Ricky	I am my grandfather’s grandson. And I’m proud of that.

Martin	Are you okay?

Jane	Yeah, I’m okay. How are you?

Martin	I think I’ll live.

Langley	You good? I’m glad. I’m not okay. Not okay here.	I’m not fine. We’re not done. We’re not done, you and me.

Ricky	I’m so sorry, Mom.

Jane	What?

Ricky	When I finally realized I could use it to help you save the Science Museum, it was too late. I feel like I let you down.

Jane	Oh, Ricky, no, you didn’t. There is nothing more important to me in this world than you.

Curtis	Naturally, I had everything under control.

Seth	That’s him right there, officers.

Langley	Oh, thank God you guys are here. Heh heh. Yeah…

Martin	I know I’m the last guy you probably want to talk to right now, but I just wonder if you’d give me to explain myself.

Ricky	Mom.

Curtis	I’ll keep this in a safe place, Ms. Young.

Jane	Thanks, Curtis.

Martin	The truth is, is that I’m an archaeologist, like your grandfather, Ricky. The only difference is that I got involved with some guys that I thought were legit but they turned out to be gangsters who sold stuff on the black market, namely Langley. He was looking for this precious artifact.

Ricky	wish box.

Martin	Yeah. He told me that all I had to do was get close to this woman and her son and find out anything I could, and if I did that, then he’d let me go free forever. It seemed so easy. That is until I met that woman and her son. I fell in love with both of them.

Langley 	Hey, you blew it, kid. You had your chance. You haven’t heard the last of me, Ricky Martin. I’ll see ya in the big house, where you belong. Oh, and Jane, don’t wait for me. Live your life, you rambling rose.

Ricky	Martin, don’t listen to him. Langley blackmailed you. He’s the one that should go to jail, not you. Besides, we’re a family now.

Martin	You really think so?

Ricky	Yeah. But I’m not the one you have to convince.

Sandy	Hey, that was awesome what you did back there.

Bill	Yeah, well done, bro.

Ricky	It was all of us, team effort.

Sandy	Score one for the Adventure Club.

Jane	Is there anything else I need to know?

Martin	No. I mean, let’s be honest, I was never a very good criminal anyway. I mean, look at me.

Seth	I just wanted to say, good job. And that I’m sorry for everything. You guys were right. All I really wanted was to be part of the club.

Sandy 	Thanks, Seth.

Ricky	You know what? You are part of the club.

Jane	Well, unfortunately, you guys, I think that I’m gonna have to concede defeat. There is no way that I’m gonna be able to raise enough money by the end of the month to save the Science Museum. You know, sometimes you can’t make all your wishes come true.

Martin	Don’t say that.

Ricky	True wishes are granted from within.” Maybe we can.

Jane	What do you mean?

Ricky	I think I understand what grandpa meant by this note. At first I thought he meant from within the wish box, but he didn’t because those aren’t true wishes. True wishes are granted from within yourself. It’s up to you to make your wishes come true. Don’t you see? We can save the Science Museum.

Curtis	All right, folks, single file…single file. Let’s keep everything moving in an orderly fashion.

Jane	Isn’t this amazing? How are we doing? Good. Okay. Sorry.

Sandy	I gotta say, this is pretty amazing.

Ricky	All this thanks to our first adventure. It took a while, but it was a doozy.

Bill	I’ll say. My only question is…what adventure are we gonna go on next?

Ricky	I’m sure something will come up.

Alexa	You guys are the kids who recovered the wish box, right?

Sandy	That’s right.

Alexa	That was pretty amazing.

Ricky	Thanks. Who are you?

Alexa	I work for an agency called the International Artifact Society. We work with archaeologists around the world recovering lost, precious relics and ensuring they do not fall into the wrong hands. In fact, we did a lot of work with your grandfather.

Ricky	Really?

Alexa	Someone you know thought that maybe we should meet. It’s really nice seeing you follow in your grandfather’s footsteps. All of you, keep up the good work. We’ll be in touch.

Ricky	Thank you. Look at this.

Sandy	That was so cool.

Bill	Super cool!

Ricky	Long live the Adventure Club.

Ricky	Bam.

Sandy	Bam.

Bill	Bam. 

All	Pshhh!

Ricky	Zing. 

Sandy	Zing.

Bill	Zing.

All	Adventure Club!
