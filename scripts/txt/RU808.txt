RUPAUL	Previously on "Rupaul's Drag Race"…  You'll be working in pairs to create presidential campaign ads.

THORGY THOR	I immediately was like--(trills tongue) I wrote  pages.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Damn, Thorgy.

DERRICK BARRY	Every team is going to hope that Bob and I fail.  Why?

DERRICK BARRY	But we both want to win.

BOB THE DRAG QUEN	(cackles)

MICHELLE	(laughing)

THORGY THOR	I think we got everything.

MICHELLE	Do you want a shot of Chi Chi drinking booze?

THORGY THOR	I think I'm good.

MICHELLE	Okay.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

VIVICA	I got totally confused when you didn't say anything about the booze.

THORGY THOR	There were too many ideas.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne.

MICHELLE	We just had to push you a little bit for you to be in your skin.

RUPAUL	Just be you.  Honey, that's why we sent you a plane ticket.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen and Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	I would love to see a fully realized glamasaurus Rex.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Okay.

CARSON	Don't just give us that same old pretty makeup.  Show us something completely different.

RUPAUL	Condragulations.  You are both the winners of this week's challenge.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne, shantay, you stay.  Thorgy Thor.  Sashay away.

KIM CHI	Mmm.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Whoo, mama.  Goodness.

NAOMI SMALLS	Girl.

DERRICK BARRY	Poor Thorgy.

KIM CHI	I cannot believe that all happened.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That was a--that was a rough one.

DERRICK BARRY	That was, like, so emotional.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	"Please take down Bob.  She's terrible."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	"Anyway, love you guys.  "Top three, Naomi, Bob and Deryk.  That was shady.  Thorgy."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There you have it, girl.

KIM CHI	Whoa, that was really shady.  Damn, Thorgy.  But you're not here anymore, so I guess it really doesn't matter, huh?  I thought we had a special connection.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, you realize that's so typical Thorgy.  I mean, that's my homegirl.  I was so excited to see her when I got here.  And I was sad to see her go.  Even though she got competitive with me, that's Thorgy.  I love her anyway.  And I really am gonna miss her.  That was a lip-sync for the ages, mama.

DERRICK BARRY	That was epic.


CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm at a loss for words, 'cause it was so unexpected.  Child, I'm gonna erase this (bleep).  Real talk, y'all?  Derrick's ass should've been lip-synching tonight, and I know I'm not the only girl that's thinking it.

NAOMI SMALLS	When they said that Derrick was in the top, I was like, "Okay, I did not see that."

DERRICK BARRY	That's where her jealousy kicked in.

KIM CHI	Purely based on the runway look, I think Derrick should've been in the bottom.  Derrick's black-and-white runway looked like he stepped out of the thrift store bargain sale day.

DERRICK BARRY	Bob and I smeared the (bleep) out of each other like Ru told us to do, so I felt like Bob and I won.  I think the other queens, those bitches better be scared, because now I'm competition.  Oh, you didn't win a challenge?  Oh, I did?  And I didn't have to do anything Britney to win.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I think it was your ensemble that they read you for.  Your outfit.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah, I think that's where all the negative was.  And they want you to start carving yourself.

DERRICK BARRY	It's just funny to me, because this is my drag.

NAOMI SMALLS	First let's start with blocking those brows down and changing your paint.  Derrick paints like a real woman would paint, and that's not drag.

KIM CHI	The thing is, they have seen this look from you, so I think they want to see something else you can do with a higher arch brow…

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah, and I get that.  I get that, that I really didn't change my makeup besides doing black and white, but I wanted to look like an old movie star.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'll tell you this.  If they tell you to do more draggy, block that brow.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Bring it up to your goddamn (bleep) hairline.

DERRICK BARRY	Right.  If I come out, and I do not have my brow raised, there is no excuse for me to be here.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Derrick talking about she gonna change her makeup, do this, do that.  Like, girl, we've been telling you that from the beginning.  Like, what the (bleep)?

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, my goodness.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Girl, it is too damn late.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Bye, boo-boo.

BACKUP SINGER	Rupaul Drag Race.

RUPAUL	The winner of "Rupaul's Drag Race" receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $,.  With extra special guest judges David and Amy Sedaris!

BACKUP SINGER	Rupaul Drag Race.

SINGER	May the best woman.  Best woman win.

SINGER	You wear it well.  French tip, lipstick, painted on.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh!

KIM CHI	Whoo!  Fantastic five!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughs)

NAOMI SMALLS	Today is gonna be super important because the crown is so close you can taste it, and you do not want to be that bitch that got sent home so close.

ALL	Whoo, girl.  She done already done had herses.

RUPAUL	Now, they say you can't judge a book by its cover.  Ha!  You need to grow a spine, girlie.  Be a real page-turner.  And for the love of God, don't forget to tuck your bookworm.

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

ALL	Hi!

RUPAUL	Ladies, at this point in the competition, you're family.  And sometimes, to bring sisters closer together, it's good to do some family role-playing.  And we're gonna do it with puppets.

DERRICK BARRY	Yes.

RUPAUL	Why?

ALL	'Cause everybody loves puppets.

RUPAUL	Everybody love puppets.

RUPAUL	Pick a puppet that represents one of your competitors, and drag it up.  First up, Kim Chi.

NAOMI SMALLS	All right, girl.

RUPAUL	Dig deep for a puppet.  Who is it?

KIM CHI	Chi Chi.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh, no.

RUPAUL	All right, next up, Chi Chi DeVayne.  Oh, dear.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(gasps)

RUPAUL	Ooh!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's…

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I have Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	They gave me hair.  That was nice.

RUPAUL	Next up, Derrick Barry.

DERRICK BARRY	Ooh!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	The hair!

DERRICK BARRY	I got Naomi.

RUPAUL	All right, Naomi.  Vogue over to the hole.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Kack-k-k-kack, ka-kack-ka-kack, pow.

NAOMI SMALLS	Derrick Barry.

DERRICK BARRY	It's gonna be even worse than her snatch game.

KIM CHI & NAOMI SMALLS	(laugh)

RUPAUL	All right, Bob, you're up.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Kim Chi!

KIM CHI	Yay!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Look at Kim Chi go.  Oops!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, no!  Oh, (bleep)!

RUPAUL	All right, ladies.  You have  minutes to drag up your puppets.

RUPAUL	Go.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	All right!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I need the tiniest lashes possible for Derrick.

NAOMI SMALLS	Wow.  I wear s.  (bleep).

DERRICK BARRY	Okay, let me get the fabric that is the cheapest, without a sparkle, for Naomi.

NAOMI SMALLS	Because I don't have to rely on fabric.

DERRICK BARRY	You do have to rely on your body, though, apparently.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh, snap.  Derrick and Naomi, I think they're getting tired of each other.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm lucky I didn't get someone who wears makeup.

DERRICK BARRY	Wow.  Remember, honey.  I paint for the Las Vegas stage, where you actually have to look like someone.  You just have to look like Raven.

NAOMI SMALLS	No, I have my own drag aesthetic.  It's called Naomi Smalls.

DERRICK BARRY	Mmm.  It's called Naomi Smalls?  Keep giving me material, honey.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ooh!

RUPAUL	Time's up, ladies.  Let the bitch fest begin.  Coming to the stage, Kim Chi.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(as Kim Chi) I used to be  pounds.  (normal voice) And what did you get down to?  (as Kim Chi) .  (normal voice) Oh, my god!  Condragulations, girl.  (as Kim Chi) Well, the camera adds ten pounds.  I ate, like, seven cameras.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(as Kim Chi) Do you have a bit of a speech impediment?  (normal voice) Speech impediment?  Oh, my god!  Kim, this is ridiculous.  Thank you.  Bye, Kim.  Oh, (bleep).

KIM CHI	All right, this is Kim Chi.  And--oh, Chi Chi, you're still here.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

KIM CHI	Ooh, um, the judges keep telling you the word titties, and all I can see is your boy nipples.  (as Chi Chi DeVayne) (bleep) I'm a cheap queen.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

KIM CHI	Let's talk about your two-inch heels.

KIM CHI	(as Chi Chi DeVayne) They coming to the stores, I paid  bucks.  (normal voice) When I saw the bag, it said $..

KIM CHI	Why does your hair bump never blend in to your hairline?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Bitch, my hair is blended in.  Most of the time, girl.

KIM CHI	(as Chi Chi DeVayne) See, I told you, I'm a cheap queen.

DERRICK BARRY	So, Naomi, I'm wondering.  Is this your roller girl look, neon look, or Madonna kimono look?  (as Naomi Smalls) They're all the same.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

NAOMI SMALLS	No, ma'am.  I have never looked like that in my entire life.  I would never wear some shake and go eyoncé wig.

DERRICK BARRY	There's one thing I do want to talk--ooh, you're doing a split, girl.  That's the most talented thing I think I've seen you do on this competition.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Damn, Derrick, you are cutting deep, bitch.  This is a puppet show.  Kids are here.

DERRICK BARRY	The one thing I want to talk to you about is your snatch game.  Your New York was really bad.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Damn, shady.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, flavor flav!  No, you didn't!

RUPAUL	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	Okay, try to do that.  (as Naomi Smalls) (monotone) Oh, flavor flav.  Oh, no, you didn't.

NAOMI SMALLS	Derrick, does it hurt, me having my hand inside you?  (as Derrick Barry) No, I'm used to sitting on two (bleep) at one time.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick and Naomi, they're like Tom and Jerry.  Like Nene Leakes and Kim Zolciak.

NAOMI SMALLS	Derrick, tell me about your drag.  (as Derrick Barry) Well, I don't really have a drag style.  There is no Derrick Barry.  There is Britney Spears.  But I hand-sewed this piece of fabric that's just buttoned up around my waist.

DERRICK BARRY	That sucked.



CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(as Bob The Drag Queen) Hey, everybody.  I'm Bob The Drag Queen.  (normal voice) Hey, Bob, how you doing?  (as Bob The Drag Queen) I'm doing well.  I talk a lot.  I work at every club in New York.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(as Bob The Drag Queen) I have a big mouth!  I think I'm all that, even though my wigs look like Chi Chi's.  Yeah!  Jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes.  (normal voice) So what are you gonna do when you run out of jokes?  (as Bob The Drag Queen) I know what I'll do.  Walk into the club purse first.  Bam!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(as Bob The Drag Queen) Walk into the club purse first.  Bam!  New York, baby!

RUPAUL	Wow.  So you bitches just didn't hold anything back, did you?  The winner of today's mini challenge is…Chi Chi DeVayne.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Whoa!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(as Bob The Drag Queen) I never lose a challenge.

RUPAUL	All right, ladies.  For this week's maxi challenge, we're having a Book Ball.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs) Oh, word.

RUPAUL	Now, in honor of our guest judge, author and humorist David Sedaris…

RUPAUL	I'm challenging you to put together three different looks that tell the story of your life.  First category is Baby Drag Realness.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

RUPAUL	You know, when you were five years old, and you slipped on those first pair of heels?  Second category is That's My Mama Realness.  A drag look that pays tribute to your own sweet mama.  Third category is Autobiographical Eleganza Extravaganza!  A couture creation made entirely…out of books.

NAOMI SMALLS	Ooh.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh.

RUPAUL	#Rupaulbookball.

RUPAUL	For your first two looks, you can use clothes, shoes, and accessories from the Out of the Closet Thrift Store.  Gentleman, start your engines, and may the best woman win!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Whoo!

NAOMI SMALLS	Is that really how I sound?  How Derrick did my puppet?

DERRICK BARRY	Is that really how I sound?  You're like Paris Hilton.  It's just like giving me one note.

KIM CHI	Damn.

NAOMI SMALLS	I actually thought that was very clever.

DERRICK BARRY	You're not mad at it?

NAOMI SMALLS	No.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, cool.

NAOMI SMALLS	Not at all.  Bitch, I have tough skin.

DERRICK BARRY	t looks like it.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(scoffs) you really testing out that tough skin, ain't you, girl?

NAOMI SMALLS	And Derrick has thin hair.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ha-ha!

NAOMI SMALLS	(squeals)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN & NAOMI SMALLS	(laugh)

DERRICK BARRY	Wow.  I also have a career with my wigs on.  You'll have a career once you start gluing yours down.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Baby.

KIM CHI	Popcorn.  (crunches)

DERRICK BARRY	The fun thing about Naomi is she only has one thing to say.  And then she has to think for, like, hours to come with another read.
KIM CHI	(crunches)

DERRICK BARRY	I have one thing to say.  I'm not that smart.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoa.

NAOMI SMALLS	Were you upset by my puppet?

DERRICK BARRY	I honestly don't remember what you said.

NAOMI SMALLS	Everything was factual.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

KIM CHI	Why do you guys hate each other?  Can't you guys just get along?  God damn it.

NAOMI SMALLS	I do not hate Derrick.  I do not like his drag.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	This is getting intense.

DERRICK BARRY	You don't hate me; you just hate my drag.

NAOMI SMALLS	There, exactly.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's gonna get severe up in here!


BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's gonna get severe up in here.  Gat, gat, boom!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Derrick and Naomi are starting World War III in this bitch.  Y'all is going for blood today.  The (bleep) has hit the fan, honey.

RUPAUL	Coming up…  Do you know how to do glamazon drag?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I want to show up in a leotard.

RUPAUL	We're looking for your story.  Who are you?

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm Naomi Smalls.

RUPAUL	Right.  (laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

DERRICK BARRY	This week's challenge is the Book Ball.  We have to come up with three looks.  So we have Baby Drag, a mama look, and Book Drag, where we have to design a high fashion costume out of books.

KIM CHI	Watch out for the paper cuts, ladies.

RUPAUL	Hey, sexy librarians.

ALL	Hi!  Hello!

RUPAUL	Hi, Derrick Barry.

DERRICK BARRY	Hi, Ru.

RUPAUL	You're cutting up my book.

DERRICK BARRY	I know.  My Eleganza Extravanganza is taking elements of your book and mixing them with famous paintings.  Because I feel like celebrity female impersonation is such an art form.

RUPAUL	Right.  But you've come under a lot of fire in terms of aesthetic.  And also last week, the judges called you out on your makeup, specifically to make it look more draggy.  'Cause you paint.  You just paint what's there.  Do you know how to paint an illusion on your face?

DERRICK BARRY	Yes.

DERRICK BARRY	I will definitely be giving you a brow.

RUPAUL	Yes, darling.

DERRICK BARRY	Definitely, darling.  If the judges want me to wipe my eyebrow out and draw on a new one, I'm gonna do that.  I'm ready to take a risk, and I want to show the judges I came here to really challenge myself.


RUPAUL	Why, Chi Chi DeVayne.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Hey, Ru the Q.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	What are you gonna do for your mama drag look?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	My mother, to me she's high glam.  She always wears platinum blonde hair, long eyelashes.  She loves leopard.  She's a party girl.  I definitely get my ability to dance from my mom.  I didn't realize it until we went to, like, a wedding one time.  Lady know how to cut a rug.

RUPAUL	Now, tell me this.  What are you gonna do for your Eleganza Extravaganza?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm the unconventional queen.  I've worked with paper before, so I'm just going to wow you guys.

RUPAUL	Well, Chi Chi, remember what was said last week.  We want Chi Chi.  Now, we want an elevated Chi Chi.  We want you to be refined.  We say country, that's not a bad word.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah.

RUPAUL	It's flavor.  Savor in it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Okay.

RUPAUL	Bask in it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Never be ashamed of it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm realizing that country is in.  So I guess I got to heighten what I do.  I just want to pull it off.  I want to do good.
RUPAUL	Well, hello there, Bob.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Hey, Rupaul.

RUPAUL	Now, last week, the judges, Michelle, specifically, called you out to see if you could do glamazon drag.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm gonna go glamorous for my book look.  So I'm taking this corset.  I've already got three pieces glued down.  Look at me go.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs) Do a corset that kind of branches out, goes past the bosoms.

RUPAUL	Yes.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Then I'm gonna do like a gradient color.

RUPAUL	Well, 'cause you know, Michelle calls your drag ratchet drag.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah.

MICHELLE	I am in love with the way you look tonight.  Less ratchet, more fashion.

RUPAUL	Do you call your drag ratchet drag?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I've never called it ratchet, but that term doesn't offend me.

RUPAUL	Is that a conscious decision?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's a conscious decision.  'Cause if you come to one of my shows, it's like me on stage by myself for an hour and a half.  And if I'm gonna be in, like, a gown with huge earrings and big old sculpted up-do, by the time my show's done, my eyebrows become my moustache, I'm sweating.  See what I mean?  So I'm gonna show up in a leotard.

RUPAUL	You're so confident.  What scares you?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	My mom got sick recently.  She has, like, a chronic and really rare form of pneumonia called BOOP, which sounds cute, but it's not that cute, actually.  I got the scariest call, which is like, "You need to come here."  I was, like, really freaked out.

RUPAUL	Yeah, yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	My mom had been very physically fit, and then she was just, like, skinny and frail, and, like, her hair was falling out.  And she couldn't do anything.  Like, anything.

RUPAUL	Wow.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I mean, it was really hard to see my mom like that.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	All of the things in my life that, like, make me a good person are because my mom taught me to do it.  I don't have a lot of people like my mom in my family.  (crying softly) (bleep) got me, you bitch.

RUPAUL	Wow.  That's pretty rough.  What do you think your mom would think about you in this competition?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs) My mom thinks I'm the best ever.  My mom is the funniest person I know.  My mom is my hero, and she showed me that you can do anything.  More importantly, come through anything.

RUPAUL	All right.  Well, I want to see gorgeous Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Note taken.

RUPAUL	All right.  Thanks.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Here we go, girl.

RUPAUL	Hi, Naomi.

NAOMI SMALLS	Hi, Ru.

RUPAUL	Now, this is of course an autobiographical challenge.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yes.

RUPAUL	We're looking for your story.  Who are you?

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm Naomi Smalls.

RUPAUL	Yeah, that's kind of vague.  I want more.  How are you going to insert more of you into this challenge?

NAOMI SMALLS	My mom is such a huge part of who I am.  I'm such a huge fan of hers.

RUPAUL	And she had how many kids?

NAOMI SMALLS	She had one in her first marriage, and my dad had two in his first marriage, and they got together and they had one, and then eight of them are adopted.

RUPAUL	And that is…

NAOMI SMALLS	That's .

RUPAUL	.  Wow.

NAOMI SMALLS	For that's My Mama Realness, I want to portray what a classic beauty my mom is.  She doesn't need huge hair and big diamonds.  She doesn't need anything to amp her up.  She just knows she's perfect in my eyes.

RUPAUL	Now, a few weeks ago, you were almost fading into the background.

NAOMI SMALLS	Right.

RUPAUL	But you came up from behind and just knocked 'em dead.

NAOMI SMALLS	Well, I'm actually kind of thankful that I was in the bottom two, because it literally lit a fire underneath my ass.  This is what I want to do, and I should just (bleep) bring it every single time.

RUPAUL	Well, you know, two weeks ago, it was a design challenge that you won.

NAOMI SMALLS	Mm-hmm.

RUPAUL	And I want that same excitement from you in this challenge.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm just nervous, because the judges like what I'm doing so far, and I don't want to give them any reason to doubt me.  I want to prove to them that I'm not a one-hit wonder.

RUPAUL	Well, I can't wait to see what you're going to do.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you, Ru.

RUPAUL	Get back to work.

RUPAUL	Hi, Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	Hi, Ru.

RUPAUL	You're a design queen.

KIM CHI	Yes, I am.

RUPAUL	So this is something you can sink your teeth into.  What are you planning?

KIM CHI	With all three of the runways, it's kind of like a visual fairy tale.  So I'm going to start off as a little sprout.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

KIM CHI	And through drag, I blossom into the artist that I'm going to become.

RUPAUL	Wow.  So, now, this challenge has a part that pays homage to your mother.  What is that gonna look like?

KIM CHI	Oh, my gosh.  So this one I'm really excited about.  I brought a traditional Korean hanbok, because my mother taught me to be proud of who I am and my heritage.

RUPAUL	It's something your mother has worn before?

KIM CHI	Yes.

RUPAUL	Has she seen you in drag?

KIM CHI	She doesn't know that I do drag.

RUPAUL	What?

KIM CHI	I know.  My mom thinks I'm a makeup artist.

RUPAUL	You know she's gonna see this show.  Are you afraid?

KIM CHI	I am a bit afraid that she might see all of this as, like, a waste of time.  I just want my mom to be able to be proud of, like, everything that I do.  You know, the person that I am today.

RUPAUL	You think she doesn't know that already?

KIM CHI	I don't think so, no.

RUPAUL	Hmm.

RUPAUL	Have you never shown her that side of you?

KIM CHI	Not really, 'cause I just don't like being vulnerable with my mom.

RUPAUL	Right.

KIM CHI	'Cause then she might think that I'm a weak person, and I want to portray myself as anything but that.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I think that Kim should tell her mom.  'Cause I feel like if you're not really opening yourself up to your family, then you're robbing them of the experience of getting to know and experience you for who you are.  I mean, in theory, I know Kim better than her (bleep) mom knows her.  That's not fair.

RUPAUL	Is that why you got so emotional on the runway when you were being critiqued?

KIM CHI	I felt like I tried my best, but it just didn't work out.  So I just got really frustrated.

RUPAUL	I just felt like there was a sense of shame when you broke down.  Somehow they're all linked together.  I'm not sure how.  And that's what I'm trying to get at.

KIM CHI	I'm very hard on myself about being perfect.  Especially growing up, because I wasn't the model child, and I was the "artistic" one.  And last week's performance was a letdown, because I feel like my mom probably wouldn't be proud of what I did.  I just want to do really well in this competition.

RUPAUL	You have done really well.  It's top five.  You are so talented.  Everybody knows that about you.  But do you know it?

KIM CHI	I know it, yeah.

RUPAUL	But do you own it?

KIM CHI	I will own it.

RUPAUL	Will own it?  After this challenge, or later this…

KIM CHI	No, right now.  I will own it.


RUPAUL	Okay.  I need you to really hear yourself say that, because that's the key to this competition.  If you see it, we can see it, you know?  All right, get back to work.

KIM CHI	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Ladies!  Gather round.  Now, listen, I've got good news.  Tomorrow on the main stage, in addition to David Sedaris, we will be joined by his twisted sister…

KIM CHI	(gasps)

RUPAUL	Actress and author Amy Sedaris will be here.

RUPAUL	Oh, right, and there's one more thing.  In addition to your three Book Ball looks, you'll be performing an opening number.  A tribute to Amy's comedy classic, "Strangers With Candy" in full Jerri Blank-inspired drag.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That's gonna be ridiculous.

RUPAUL	So Chi Chi, you won the mini challenge, so you're in charge of the choreography.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	So good luck, you boozers, users, and losers.  And don't (bleep) it up.  Coming up…

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Let's start from the beginning.  (humming) Got it?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	We down to the top five.  I ain't finna correct her.

KIM CHI	Thrown in jail, wow.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	So Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	I'm worried that I might lose this challenge.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)
	
CHI CHI DEVAYNE	All right.

NAOMI SMALLS	Down to production.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	For today's challenge, we have to come up with three different looks for the Book Ball and a dance number.  It's a tribute to Jerri Blank, the character Amy Sedaris plays on the TV show "Strangers With Candy."  It's about embodying this particular character.

DERRICK BARRY	Chi Chi, you don't even need the teeth in.

NAOMI SMALLS	Oh, damn.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I told y'all she says shady (bleep) all the time.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, we can't say things in jest?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Let's start from the beginning.  We're gonna have--(humming) got it?

KIM CHI	No.  (laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Okay, let's do it again.

KIM CHI	Wait.  So when I--I get to the end, I do it step turn this way?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Why not for this time you stand behind me, so you can actually see someone doing it in front of you?

KIM CHI	Okay, that sounds much better.  (laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Ready, and--(humming).  Got it?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There's the walking.  It's literally, walk, walk, walk, turn.

NAOMI SMALLS	Oh, god.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Start over.  (sings) Hey, hey, I've got something to say.  I was a teenage runaway.  Thrown in jail.  Wha…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	So Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	I'm worried that I might lose this challenge just because I can't dance, and I don't want that to happen.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Come on, let's do it again.  I'ma watch it this time, guys.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(sings) I was a teenage runaway, I was a boozer and a user and don't forget, a loser!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Bob can actually dance.  I don't know why she plays it down that she's just a comedian.  Girl can dance.  But I don't know how these other girls are gonna do.  I don't know, girl.

NAOMI SMALLS	I was a big fan of the pole.  Also love the hole.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Naomi, she's still modeling, she's still voguing, and oh, oh, and oh.  She's not kind of channeling that ugliness of Jerri Blank.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You're walking like a model.  And I need you to walk like Jerri Blank.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah, think a hunchback.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	There you go.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	She has a FUPA.

DERRICK BARRY	Think scoliosis, like you had in high school.

NAOMI SMALLS	I actually have no idea who the (bleep) is Jerri Blank.  What's "Strangers With Candy"?  Somebody please tell me.  (laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	Think, like, first of all, do this face, and then come down and--(vocalizing)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick is doing this, like, weird thing.  She's playing like a (bleep) caveman almost.  I don't know what the (bleep) she's doing.  This is the sexiest you've ever looked.

NAOMI SMALLS	He's so ugly.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	We down to the top five.  I ain't finna correct her.

DERRICK BARRY	(sighs) Whoo.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	So we're back in the work room, and it's crunch time.

KIM CHI	Make it or break it right now.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	We have a short amount of time, so it's work, work, work.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm nervous about this challenge.  I'm trying to prove that I can be glamorous.  But this is not my field of expertise.  I don't work with unconventional materials at home.  This is very stressful.  It's a lot of (bleep).

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah.

KIM CHI	Yeah, there's just so much to do.  This is, like, crazy.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	For my book drag, I decided to use cardboard.  Because I want, like, a really structured dress.  I'm taking some very bold moves.  I'm not sewing anything.

KIM CHI	Thank God.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	All hot glue and spray paint.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I mean, well, bitch, somebody got to go home.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(chuckling) Oh, yeah.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Bob's using more cardboard than she is books.  That's not the challenge.  Honey, you got it all wrong.  You're in for a rude awakening, girl.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

DERRICK BARRY	I think you're gonna take great photos, but that does not take talent.

NAOMI SMALLS	Bitch, glue down your brows, and then I'll glue down my lace.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, (bleep).

DERRICK BARRY	I'm here in this room with you right now, in the top five.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ooh!  The library has opened again.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

NAOMI SMALLS	For today's maxi challenge, we're getting ready for the Book Ball.  This challenge is literally super-important, because it decides who makes the top four.  It's a huge deal.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	So, do you guys feel, like, a lot of pressure about being top five and having to perform well?

NAOMI SMALLS	I think it would suck especially to go home right now.  'Cause it's literally so close you can taste it.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Do you think you hands-down deserve to win?

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah.  I think everyone should have that mentality.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Agreed.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Most definitely.

KIM CHI	Why do you think you deserve to win?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I've got the best grades in school.

DERRICK BARRY	But when you look at Rupaul's beauty and grace, do you feel like you possess that, because I don't see, in the past winners, the beauty that they have.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Damn.

NAOMI SMALLS	That bitch just called you ugly.

DERRICK BARRY	No, no, no.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN & CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laugh)

DERRICK BARRY	I've just never heard them ever say to a previous winner that they did ratchet drag.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	All the queens think that I can't be glamorous because Michelle called me ratchet one time, in a good way.  And it's all they can cling to, especially Derrick.  You keep thinking ratchet drag means something bad.  Ratchet and like, this idea of somebody being raggedy are not the same thing.

KIM CHI	But Bob, I've seen, like, your videos online, and I think you're very funny, but, like, the first thing I thought was, like, she literally wears lips and lashes.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Whoo.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I guess, but I mean, I do my thing.  You know, people will come to my show.

KIM CHI	I just think, like, makeup is very important because the moment people look at you, that's the first thing you see.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I also want to say, my makeup's not that (bleep) bad.

DERRICK BARRY	Ooh.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You guys act like I have, like, the worst makeup in "Drag Race" history.  Granted, it's not the best.  I am no makeup artist.

KIM CHI	I don't think your makeup is terrible, it just looks like you're not wearing any.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's a bit of a shock, people thinking that my makeup is so bad, 'cause no one's ever read me for my makeup.

KIM CHI	I don't think you even try to, like, add more dimensions with your makeup.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I do feel, though, the judges say, "Oh, I can see you're trying."

KIM CHI	I think the judges are comparing Bob to himself.  But if you compare Bob to me and Naomi, Bob's makeup is nonexistent.  I'm not, you know, like, putting your talents down.  But I just think, like, if all people have to see is, like, your pictures, to, like, judge you…
NAOMI SMALLS	Because there is, like, a standard with drag.  Especially "Drag Race."  You have to have your makeup at a certain level.  You have to have your wigs at a certain level.



BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	They're absolutely right.  I pay more attention to my performances than I do to my makeup.  But what matters is, are you delivering a product to people who want to buy it.  That's what matters.  So if your thing is beauty, then yeah, beauty matters a lot.  But my goal is to be an entertainer.  And I am an entertainer.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm not saying that you should just be beautiful, and you should win because it's a beauty pageant.  But you don't have to be a (bleep) stand-up comedian, or just a live singer or a dancer.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Why you coming--why you coming for me, bitch?

NAOMI SMALLS	There is definitely a beauty standard when it comes to drag.  You could be doing an amazing death drop, but it's not gonna be as impressive if you look a (bleep) busted mess.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	My name's Bennett, and I'm not in it, but I will say is I do think…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You in it now, bitch.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I think you need a talent to not only win but to make money in the future.  Like, I'm a dancer.  Everybody knows that I dance.  Everybody knows Bob does…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Everything.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Everybody knows.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

KIM CHI	Not makeup.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I think you need some kind of talent.  I mean, Naomi, I look at you as a model.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	And to me, that's the only that I've--you know what I mean, that I've seen.  That's what I get from you.

DERRICK BARRY	Right, I agree.  I think you're gonna take great photos, but that does not take talent.

NAOMI SMALLS	Being a drag queen is such a talent.  You are a performer.  You have to be a makeup artist, you have to be a hairstylist, you have to be…

DERRICK BARRY	So if you're a hairstylist, why haven't you glued down your lace fronts?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, (bleep).  The library has opened again.  Insert shady rattlesnake noise here.  Roo koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-koo- koo-koo-koo-koo.

NAOMI SMALLS	Bitch, glue down your brows, and then I'll glue down my lace.

DERRICK BARRY	I cannot wait to see a shot of you and have screen caps go around, and it's just lifted lace.

NAOMI SMALLS	And you know what yours is gonna be?  It's gonna be so much light reflected off that forehead, because there's no brow on there.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs) I love that you two can't let it go.  Derrick, you and I are not frenemies any more.  You two are almost enemies at this point, girl.

DERRICK BARRY	And I didn't get the challenge to do my brows until my last challenge.

NAOMI SMALLS	But the judges told you to do that.  The judges haven't told me to glue down my wigs yet.  They're telling you to change up your makeup and carve out your face.

DERRICK BARRY	Do you not understand what I do for a living?  I don't carve my face out.  There's no lines on my face.  That's not gonna look like a female illusion.  That's going to look like drag makeup.  Not one time did they tell me that my makeup is not good.

NAOMI SMALLS	And I'm telling you, like, as a friend, change up your makeup.  It's not me digging at you.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There are some digs in there.  (laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	But, Naomi, why would I change my makeup when I impersonate Britney Spears for a living?

NAOMI SMALLS	And that's why it bugs me.  Because we're coming into this competition, and we're representing ourselves.  We're not representing a celebrity.  I feel like I'm telling Derrick what the judges have been tiptoeing around this entire time.  And literally someone just needs to be blunt about it, because Derrick is not understanding it.  And even though Derrick never really asked me, but someone needs to tell him the truth.  Who is Derrick Barry?  Chad came here with his own aesthetic.  He wasn't doing Cher the entire time.

DERRICK BARRY	Chad had been doing drag for years, and…

NAOMI SMALLS	And so have you.

DERRICK BARRY	And not impersonating Cher.

NAOMI SMALLS	Okay.  Like, when you're coming to represent you as a drag queen, not Britney Spears, why wouldn't you come as Derrick Barry?

DERRICK BARRY	Being compared to Britney Spears in the slightest is the biggest compliment in the world.  And if I have to change my face to be myself, then I'm not really being myself.  I just think that you've been upset with me doing well in times where you didn't, so you take digs at me to make yourself feel better.

KIM CHI	I disagree with Derrick saying that Naomi goes after him because she's insecure.  Naomi sees Derrick's skill level as not being up to par with everybody else, and that's why she's frustrated that Derrick Barry's still here.

NAOMI SMALLS	Am I the first person who's ever said anything like this, ever, to you?

DERRICK BARRY	That has said my makeup is not good?

NAOMI SMALLS	I didn't say your makeup's not good.  It's just not drag.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	These are the most octaves I've ever heard Naomi speak in, that's for sure.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You get her excited, girl, she becomes Mariah Carey, honey.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	I just have never said that you don't belong here, so for you to say that I don't belong here…

NAOMI SMALLS	I never said you don't belong here, it's just that we literally…

DERRICK BARRY	You did.  You said it bugs you that I'm here.

NAOMI SMALLS	No, the thing that bugs me is that you are here finding who you are, this entire journey.  And we all came here with our own (bleep) aesthetic.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

DERRICK BARRY	I'm here in this room with you right now in the top five.

NAOMI SMALLS	Okay.  I'm so annoyed.  (laughs)

KIM CHI	When's dinner?

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

DERRICK BARRY	Wow.

NAOMI SMALLS	Oh.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	We are getting ready for the Book Ball.  And we are all feeling the pressure.  This is the challenge that is going to determine who's gonna be in the top four.  The heat is on.

KIM CHI	Is there anything about the runway that you're worried about?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There's a chance I might not use the bottom of my outfit.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You know when you spray paint something but it's laying down, then you lift it up and things are showing that weren't showing before?

KIM CHI	Yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	But they want me to be glamorous, so I want to wear a gown.

KIM CHI	Short can be glamorous.  Glamorous just doesn't mean like a mermaid, like, long silhouette.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah, but she's like, full-on glamour.  So I made this mermaid gown.  But it's hard to walk in, and I think I can be glamorous without wearing a dress the size of Kentucky.  This is a risk I'm willing to take.

NAOMI SMALLS	Derrick?

DERRICK BARRY	Hi.


NAOMI SMALLS	My mirror's right here.  I don't feel good about what happened with Derrick yesterday.  I feel like my mom would've, like, really, like, slapped my hand about that.  And I'm gonna do everything I can to bury the hatchet.  So if he needs a zip-up, if he needs advice, if he needs anything, I will definitely be the one to give it to him.

DERRICK BARRY	I'm going to powder and then glue again.  Is that what you do?

NAOMI SMALLS	Well, I don't cover my…

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, you don't glue down, that's right.

NAOMI SMALLS	But when it comes down to time to shape, let me know.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah.  The judges have asked me, so for the first time in this competition, I am blocking out my brows.  Ooh.  I am going for three different brow looks.  I just want to show that I'm comfortable being a different character out there.  I want my brow like here, and then out.  Does that sound right?

NAOMI SMALLS	You start light towards the front and go heavier towards like the end.

DERRICK BARRY	Okay.  The only problem is I'm wearing Ariel red hair.

NAOMI SMALLS	Well don't do a red brow.

DERRICK BARRY	No?

NAOMI SMALLS	No.  That looks too clownish.  Keep it like a strawberry blonde.

DERRICK BARRY	Okay.

NAOMI SMALLS	'Cause that's versatile for all your looks.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm proud that he's trying to give the judges something new, but he only wants to ask me about his eyebrows, and changing up your face is so much more than just eyebrows.  But I'm giving Derrick space, because I don't want him to think that I'm coming for him about his makeup.  What are you doing for your mom look?

DERRICK BARRY	She wore this blue dress in our family photo, and I did a take on that, but it's more sheer.

NAOMI SMALLS	Uh-huh.  What's your relationship like?

DERRICK BARRY	My mom was great growing up.  She was my best friend.  When I came out to her when I was , that's when everything changed.  When I came out to my mom, I thought she would embrace me with open arms.  And I got the complete opposite reaction.  The only thing she said was, "Do you mind if I keep this under my hat?"

NAOMI SMALLS	When she said that, did you take, like, super offense?

DERRICK BARRY	I, like, shut down.  I wish I had not told her.  Her opinion changed of me, and my opinion had changed of her at that point, you know?

NAOMI SMALLS	Damn.

DERRICK BARRY	That's why I have a lot of empathy for Kim Chi.  Because I know that when a kid feels broken down by their parents, it's something that will always be in the back of their mind.  And I feel like my mom broke me, and I just never--I never got put back together.

NAOMI SMALLS	How's your relationship now with your mom?

DERRICK BARRY	It's better.  My mom has always been a believer in my talent, and taught me to shoot for the stars.  And the worst that can happen is you land on the moon.

NAOMI SMALLS	I love it.  You got a great mom, kid.

DERRICK BARRY & KIM CHI	(laugh)


NAOMI SMALLS	Let me see?  Look at me, straight on.  Relax.

DERRICK BARRY	Like, that is.

DERRICK BARRY	That's relaxed.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh my goodness, girl.  Ooh.  That's all I can say is, "Ooh, my goodness."  (laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You look so different.  I mean, a completely different person.

DERRICK BARRY	Really?


BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Everyone clowns me for my makeup skills, but it's not as bad as Derrick.  It is bad.  I'm seeing tremendous effort and fearlessness, and on the other hand, I'm seeing someone's dad doing drag for the first time.  Welcome to the stage.

NAOMI SMALLS	This one's higher.

DERRICK BARRY	Really?

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah.

DERRICK BARRY	I feel like I drew this one higher to offset that.

KIM CHI	Coming to this competition, I think Derrick should have practiced covering his brows at least once, because perfecting your drag makeup takes a long time, and trying to achieve that, all of that in two hours?

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, my god.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

SINGER	Cover girl, put the bass in your walk.  Head to toe, let your whole body talk.  And, what?

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "Rupaul's Drag Race."  It's the author of "Diva Rules," Michelle Visage.

MICHELLE	Aka, the gay bible.

RUPAUL	(laughs) And the author of "Man Up," Ross Mathews.

ROSS	It's the new "Moby Dick."

RUPAUL	Emphasis on the Dick.

ROSS & MICHELLE	(laugh)

RUPAUL	The author of "Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls," David Sedaris is here.

DAVID	There are , words in this.

RUPAUL	If I could only read.

RUPAUL	And, the author of "Simple Times: Crafts for Poor People," Amy Sedaris.

AMY	It's mostly pictures.  Illiteracy is hilarious.

RUPAUL	And I didn't even get to plug my book…

RUPAUL	"Workin' It."

MICHELLE	Work those nails, girl.

RUPAUL	This week, we challenged our queens to tell their stories in three different looks.  But first, they're paying tribute to the sick and sickening Jerri Blank.

AMY	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Gentlemen, start your engines.  And may the best woman win.  Coming up…

ROSS	I see you trying harder than anyone else.

MICHELLE	You've just outdone yourself tonight.

AMY	I completely disagree.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

SINGER	Hey, hey, I've got something to say.  I was a teenage runaway.  I was a boozer and a user.  And don't forget a loser.  Oh, I'm a big fan of the pole.  But I also love the hole.

SINGER	It's got to be tight.  I was a hooker down to tango.  Hobo camp was a fandango.  Thrown in jail like a fool.  But now I'm back in high school.  Oh, I even stole a TV.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

SINGER	Did some crack cocaine.  Stole a kidney.  And I sold a white baby.  I'm Jerri, yeah, I'm Jerri.  That's me.


SINGER	Yeah!

RUPAUL	Let's get this Book Ball rolling.  Category is Baby Drag Realness.  First up, Kim Chi.

AMY	Big shoes to fill.

KIM CHI	On a blazing august day, Kim sprouted from her mother soil, full of hairy bushes.  And as she was watered with beauty, this little flower began to grow.

RUPAUL	You've got to sissy that walk, baby Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	The funny thing is that's how she walks in her real heels.

RUPAUL	Next up, Naomi Smalls.

DAVID	Lady di-aper.

NAOMI SMALLS	As a very young boy, I found a "Vogue" magazine my mom had on her night table, and it was high fashion daydreams from there.  In my head, I was prancing on a runway in front of Anna Wintour.  A supermodel was born.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

AMY	It depends.

RUPAUL	But she sure has poise.	

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Up next, we've got Bob The Baby Drag Queen.  Why, that's the biggest pearl necklace I've ever seen.

AMY	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	When I was just a little boy, I asked my mother, "What will I be?  Am I going to be pretty?  Am I going to be rich?"  And here's what she said to me.  "You'll be a drag queen, bitch."

ROSS	She's working that pebble Flintstones couture.

RUPAUL	Next, we've got Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	She changed her eyebrows.

DERRICK BARRY	When I was a little boy, I would pretend I was the little mermaid every time I took a bath.  The towels were both my gown and my hair all in one.  I was a princess in training to become a queen.

AMY	Seaman lover. 

MICHELLE	(laughs) Yeah.

RUPAUL	Next, baby Chi Chi.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	My grandmother would tell my mom, "Girl, you got something on your hands," especially when she used to catch me in her fabulous wigs.  Not much has changed now.  My mom still has something big on her hands.  A big ol' drag queen.

AMY	(laughs)

ROSS	Not the mama!  Got to love me.

RUPAUL	Category is That's My Mama Realness.  Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	Kim Chi's mother determined what she thought was best.  And that prevented Kim from blossoming.  However, her mother had to release her seed in the wind for Kim to be the botanical sensation she always wanted to become.

RUPAUL	A botanical sensation?

MICHELLE	Weed whacker.

RUPAUL	It's a weed whacker, exactly.  Naomi Smalls.

NAOMI SMALLS	My mom, June, wanted nothing more than to have a large, happy family, no matter the ethnicity or gender.  All  of her kids have their own glam shot with mother dearest.  I guess that's where I get my talent for posing and love for classic beauty.  Thanks, mom.

RUPAUL	Christina darling.


AMY & MICHELLE	(laugh)

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Martha Caldwell.  She can make a power suit from New York & Company look like Saks Fifth Avenue.

AMY	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	She also sacrificed.  When we would go get a Happy Meal, she would give me her adult-size fries and drink.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	And that's what moms do.

RUPAUL	Viola Davis.  Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?

MICHELLE	Yes!

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

DERRICK BARRY	I always imagined that sally field would play my mom, Laura, in the movie of my life, because my mom was just as pretty as sally was in "Steel Magnolias."  My favorite thing my mom wore was a light blue dress in our family photo.  I'm reimagining her in it as a nightgown, and on the night I was conceived.  No wonder my dad hit that baby one more time.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Oh, this is the story of their lives.

MICHELLE	And they have to go back to move forward.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne.  Ooh, girl.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Pop on those lashes and slip on them high heels.  That's the motto in which Albertine lives.  My mama is the original glamazon.  Miss Tina.  That's what they call her.  And raising three kids on her own, she's the definition of a true baller.

RUPAUL	Ooh, miss got the body.

AMY	Yeah.  Don't make me take my rings off.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

SINGER	The realness.

RUPAUL	Category is Autobiographical Eleganza Extravaganza.  First up, Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	Kim Chi has finally blossomed into the floral centerpiece, and now she's not afraid to showcase who she really is.  Bold and daring, avant-garde and unpredictable.  Come experience her ever-blossoming beauty.

RUPAUL	She's a real page-turner.

AMY	(laughs)

ROSS	She's making it easy to read her, honey.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

DAVID	She needs to edit the outfit.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls.

NAOMI SMALLS	As Naomi Smalls, I was blessed with two legs and a heart, and I'm not afraid to show them to the world.  What you see now is the embodiment of everything I've ever wanted to be.
RUPAUL	Cher.

MICHELLE	I think I see her bookmarks.

DAVID	Isn't she filing for chapter ?

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.  Not to be confused with Bob The Librarian.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's not about being the prettiest or wearing the best dress.  It's about taking huge risks, learning from your mistakes, and taking advice from people who've done it already.  Look.  I may make waves.  I may rock the boat.  But damn it, we're gonna make it to shore.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

AMY	Hope you like short stories.

DAVID	She has a spastic semicolon.

RUPAUL	Is that what that is?

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

AMY	Oh.

RUPAUL	Ooh!

MICHELLE	Oh.

DERRICK BARRY	In , Halloween brought out the drag in me.  For the first time, I dressed as Britney Spears.  It introduced me to the bright lights of Las Vegas, which unleashed my inner showgirl on stages all around the world.  Coming to a theater near you.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

MICHELLE	That's glossy right there.

RUPAUL	She tore a page from my book.  And she's wearing it.

RUPAUL	Several pages.  Chi Chi DeVayne.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm Chi Chi DeVayne, and I've always been a queen who uses what she has, whether it be paper or plastic trash bags.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	So look out, girls, here comes a little country queen with dreams of ruling the world.  She's guaranteed to be a best seller.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

AMY	Paper shredder.

ROSS	Shredding that runway.

RUPAUL	Have you shred any good books lately?

SINGER	The realness.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

MICHELLE	Miss Underdog .  What a glamorous mother.

DERRICK BARRY	My mom would be so proud.

ROSS	I don't know that you're at this level.

NAOMI SMALLS	(sobbing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Welcome, ladies.  It's time for the judges' critiques.  First up, Kim Chi.

AMY	I love your eye makeup.  I'd love to see what your sink looks like afterwards.

RUPAUL & ROSS	(laugh)

AMY	I felt something from each look, and couldn't wait for you to come out.

MICHELLE	I think you were the only one that actually had a continuing storyline.  It was the artistry I expect from you.  You've just outdone yourself tonight.

KIM CHI	Thank you so much.

RUPAUL	Up next, Naomi Smalls.

DAVID	With the Jerri Blank, I don't know how you did it, but you still were beautiful.

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs)

ROSS	Every look tonight, you were the star of the show.  Looks like you could wear that on a red carpet.  I love that it's so exaggerated.  To me, that is drag.
MICHELLE	And what a beautiful, glamorous mother.  I like the story of having all these children of different ethnicities, and still loving each other and not judging.

NAOMI SMALLS	I think that she's such a beautiful woman to me.  I--I love her so much.  Um, I just hope she's proud of me, 'cause I love her.

RUPAUL	Do you have a message you want to say to your mother?

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you for everything you've ever done.  And I hope I can repay you for the rest of my life.  I'm sorry.  (sobs)

RUPAUL	Thank you so much.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Up next, Bob The Drag Queen.

DAVID	I thought in the baby challenge, you actually looked like you weren't trying to be too pretty about it.  You just seemed real to me.  And I thought you did a great job reading your script.  It sounded really enthusiastic and flowed really well.

MICHELLE	Tonight I challenged you to be glamorous.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Mm-hmm.

MICHELLE	I think that you're most of the way there.  I think your makeup looks pretty, and I think your body's always on point.  But I am not getting book at all.  I'm getting cardboard.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, there is some cardboard in here, but I don't have any pages from my book.

MICHELLE	Why not?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, I had this mermaid bottom that had pages, but once I finally saw it, I was like, mmm, it's a little much.

MICHELLE	But you took off the part that actually is the challenge.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, I'm still wearing books, I'm just not wearing pages.  It's a book.

MICHELLE	Okay.

AMY	Don't listen to them.  Yeah, maybe it's not made out of the pages, but I like the color, and I like that it is different, and it's kind of shingle-like.  You have beautiful legs, and I love what you did with your hair.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I was going to wear a wig, but I was like, uh.

RUPAUL	Right.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Bob.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

RUPAUL	All right, up next.  Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	I have seen what you've done with your eyebrows.  I acknowledge that you're trying something different.  But it's going to be a journey for you.  This, tonight, for me, I just thought it was way too plain, and way too basic.

AMY	But I like that it looks like you have a real vagina.

RUPAUL	She does.

AMY	Yeah.

RUPAUL	Yeah.

DERRICK BARRY	My mom would be so proud.

AMY	Oh, yeah?

ROSS	Derrick, I see you trying harder than anyone else, and that I applaud.  But I think you're getting lost in what we want.

DERRICK BARRY	Okay.

ROSS	We want you to do you at this level.  And I don't know that you're at this level.

RUPAUL	All right, Chi Chi DeVayne.

ROSS	Your dress tonight is really one of my favorites.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Thank you, Jesus.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

ROSS	Each one of these looks told a story that made me get to know you a little bit better, especially with your mom.  Your mom is giving me "Real Housewife" of I hope my neighborhood.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE & RUPAUL	(laugh)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Real Housewives of Shreveport.

ROSS	Yeah.

DAVID	Everything that you read, your voice just really super sized it.  And I think you have my favorite line of the evening, was that "I'm just a country girl with dreams."

DAVID	You just seemed really natural and honest, and I think you did a great job with that.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Ooh, thank you.

AMY	I completely disagree.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Chi Chi, and thank you, ladies.  Now, while you go and curl up with a good book backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.

RUPAUL	All right, now, just between us best-selling authors, what do you think?  Kim Chi.

ROSS	Kim Chi is a walking art exhibit.  And tonight there was so much emotion with the stories of her mom.

RUPAUL	Who doesn't, by the way, know that she does drag.

DAVID	There was absolutely no joy when she was her mother.  She conveys a lot to me by not saying anything.

RUPAUL	Yeah, there's a lot to read between the lines there.  When she did her voice-over, the conviction wasn't quite there.  There's still a tentative thing.  And I think once her mother gets to meet her, and they get over that part of it, Kim Chi will fully blossom.  Naomi Smalls.

MICHELLE	Miss Underdog .

RUPAUL	Yes.

MICHELLE	I mean, who saw this coming?  I am filled with joy for her.  She's just come full circle, and at  years old, listening to direction.

RUPAUL	Yes.

MICHELLE	And pushing herself.

ROSS	Naomi is checking every box for me.  She is checking fashion she is checking glamour.  She is checking performance.  She is checking heartstrings.  Now I find myself rooting for her.  But is it too late?

AMY	I don't think it's too late.  At least she got there.

MICHELLE	Better late than never.

ROSS	It's like a period.

MICHELLE	What's that?

AMY	Something I had a long time ago.

ROSS & RUPAUL	(laugh)

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

MICHELLE	Bob, I thought, nailed Jerri Blank.  Out of everybody, she had the character the best.  What I don't like is the fact that she wore a cardboard dress, and books are not made of corrugated cardboard.

AMY	Don't judge a book by its cover.


AMY	You know, I didn't mind the dress or the cardboard.  At least he added some color to it.  And he made me laugh, just looking at him.

DAVID	You can just tell that he's funny.  The humor kind of just rolls off of him.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	I will commend Derrick on going all the way.  To a different species, which was…

AMY	Feces?  What'd you say?

AMY	You hear what you want to hear.

MICHELLE	Exactly.

AMY	Uh-huh.

MICHELLE	However, it was just bad, bad night in general for Derrick.  She had, like, two lines for blush, instead of being contoured and buffed out.  This is a drag competition.  Come dimensional.  When she reimagined her mother on a sexy night in a nightgown, that convoluted story I can't even put my head around.  This is all a (bleep) reach, okay?  The thing, you're on stage, she glued your book to a corset and put panties on and she was done.  This was a miss tonight.  I'm sorry.

ROSS	Yes, Derrick's wasn't up to par with the other girls, but is anyone trying harder than Derrick?  And that's got to count for something.

RUPAUL	She's so willing to receive the critique.

MICHELLE	But this is not the place to find out who you are.  She's at her limit.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne.

ROSS	Where Derrick is getting our critiques and getting lost in it, Chi Chi is getting our critiques and figuring it out.  And it's working.  This is when the horses are rounding that--I've never seen a horse race, but when they go in there right before they finish, and, like, one of them sort of, like, they start to separate?

RUPAUL	Yes, yes.

ROSS	This is that moment.

AMY	Seabiscuit.

RUPAUL	Yes.  She's…

AMY	Yes.

ROSS	And I'm hung up on that horse.

DAVID	I thought her writing was really good, and I could listen to hear talk forever.  She's just got such star power.  There's a genuineness that flows off of her.

RUPAUL	Yes.

MICHELLE	For me, I'm gonna say probably my favorite.

RUPAUL	Wow.

MICHELLE	Because neck and neck with Kim Chi, and what broke it was the performance of Jerri, took it over the top for me.

DAVID	But Kim Chi's mama drag, it was so completely compelling, so mournful and so closeted, culturally.  And that, to me, is real acting.  I just--completely captivated by her.

RUPAUL	All right.  Silence!  I've made my decision.  Bring back my…(inhales deeply) girls.  (laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Welcome back, ladies.  I've made some decisions.  Chi Chi DeVayne, this week you shredded the runway.  You're safe.  Kim Chi.  Your botanical garden trilogy is destined to be a best seller.  Condragulations, you are the winner of this week's challenge.

KIM CHI	Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

RUPAUL	You've won a $, gift card from Fabric Planet.

KIM CHI	Kamsahamnida.  I'm floating in air right now.  I'm in a cloud with unicorns, riding through the rainbow.  I could just jump up and down, 'cause I'm so happy.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls.  You're safe.  You may join the other girls.



NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you, everybody.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.  Derrick Barry.  I'm sorry, my dears, but you're both up for elimination.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm not mad.  I'm like, "You're right."  I get it.  But I'm a little disappointed in myself.  It's not a fun feeling.

DERRICK BARRY	Mmm.  I feel like I let Ru down.  I do feel like I'm in good company, because Bob's next to me, and there's no one else on the bottom I'd rather see than bob right now.  I'm gonna take Bob down.

RUPAUL	Two queens stand before me.  Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination.

RUPAUL	The time has come for you to lip-sync for your life!  Good luck, and don't (bleep) it up.

SINGER	When we're out there dancin' on the floor, darlin'.  And I feel like I need some more.  And I feel your body close to mine.  And I move on love, it's about that time.  Make me feel mighty real.  Make me feel mighty real.  You make me feel mighty real.  You make me feel mighty real.  When we get home, darlin'.  And it's nice and dark, and the music's in me.  And I'm still real hot.  And I know you love me like you should.  Oh, you make me feel mighty real.  Make me feel mighty real.  I feel real.  Real real.  I feel real.

RUPAUL	Whoo!

SINGER	I feel real, real.  You make me feel mighty real.  Oh, you've got to be real.  Mighty real.  I feel real when you touch me.  I feel real when you hold me.  Ooh!  Whoo!

RUPAUL	Ladies.  I've made my decision.  Bob The Drag Queen, shantay, you stay.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.  I just want to say, I probably had the biggest butt of this season with Derrick Barry, and I ended up being her biggest cheerleader in this competition.  Even if you're afraid of something, she does it harder than anyone.  Honestly, I love her.  And I guess that was the lesson we learned today.

RUPAUL	You may join the other girls.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(whispers) You're so brave.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry, you came here as a Vegas headliner, but you leave an international star.  Stronger than yesterday.

DERRICK BARRY	Thank you so much for this opportunity.  I'm very proud, and I'm humbled by the experience that you've given me.  And I don't want to cry, but I'm going to because that's just who I am.  And I thought for so long I would just be lost in Las Vegas, and now I get to go all around the world and represent one of my favorite icons.  So thank you so much.

RUPAUL	Thank you.  Thank you, Derrick.  Now, sashay away.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Go, Derrick!

DERRICK BARRY	That's how you go out in style, girls.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN & RUPAUL	(laugh)

DERRICK BARRY	As the international showgirl of the world!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yes!

DERRICK BARRY	I got to shine as myself.  And that's the one thing I've always felt that I was lacking.  I didn't really have a character or a knowledge of who I want to be or who I am.  But I showed up in this competition, and I did everything I could.  And that's all that matters.  You have to show up in life.  And I showed up here, and I made it so far.  And I cannot wait to see where this takes me now.  So thank you, Ru.

RUPAUL	My fantastic four, condragulations.  Remember, you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?  Can I get an amen in here?

ALL	Amen!

RUPAUL	ll right, now let the music play.

SINGER	Die tomorrow, live tonight.  Die tomorrow, live tonight.  Die tomorrow, live tonight.
