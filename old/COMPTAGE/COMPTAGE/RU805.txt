RUPAUL	Previously on "RuPaul's Drag Race"…  You're going to form your own new wave bands.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I think our costumes should be cardboard cutout geometric shapes.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yeah, no.

ACID BETTY	(sings) I just want you to be hot and saucy!

RUPAUL	(laughs)

ACID BETTY	(spits)

ALL	(sings) Rectangle girls of the world.

KIM CHI	(sings) I'm every girl, in a circle I run.

RUPAUL	In terms of the outfits in your group, were you in charge of that?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	It was a group challenge.

RUPAUL	Well, Chi Chi's shaking her head.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	The thing Thorgy had on her head.  That's what I wanted to wear.

DERRICK BARRY	I'm not gonna be in a cardboard box.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turnter.  Condragulations.  You are the winner of this week's challenge.

ROBBIE TURNER	Yes!

RUPAUL	Chi Chi Devayne.  Shantay, you stay.  Naysha Lopez.  Sashay, away.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Ugh.

DERRICK BARRY	Ooh, Chi Chi.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh, lord.

DERRICK BARRY	How do you feel, Chi Chi?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Tonight there was a lot of drama on the runway.  I ain't gonna be in no bottom again.  I apologize, Derrick.  If I'm feelin' some kind of way, I completely shut down.

DERRICK BARRY	Mm-hmm.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	And I have to change that.  I mean, it's just me being a bitch.  I'm sorry.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah, it was you being a bitch.  Well, this is my second week in the bottom three.  I am so happy to still be here.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I was in shock that it was not you lip-syncing.  It was Naysha.

DERRICK BARRY	But Chris and Debbie thought I stood out.  Chris was like, "I think you could impersonate Debbie.  And we'll take you out on tour."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	They may have been on drugs.  I want a drug test.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah, I didn't hear you get that.  But…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I did get told that my performance was phenomenal.  Which you didn't get told.

DERRICK BARRY	All right.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick, I think you just missed the point, but it's not a big deal.

DERRICK BARRY	Okay.  Well, I don't know if there was a point.  It's just Bob talking is your point all the time.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	But you'll do, like, side shady comments, and it's funny, but when I do side shady comments, it's like, over.

DERRICK BARRY	No.  No, but what you…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Anyone else see this?  Am I on lonely island?  Am I on Staten Island or am I living in Manhattan right now?

ACID BETTY	You're right.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

ACID BETTY	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	I don't see that I do that.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I can't wait till you do it again.  It'll be, like, five minutes.

NAOMI SMALLS	Lord have mercy.

ACID BETTY	The two of you, honey.  That is a pot boiling.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick's, like, "I ain't never make jokes about anyone ever."

DERRICK BARRY	Hey, Bob.  If I want to do ratchet drag next week, can you give me any tips?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Ooh, hoo, hoo!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	If you want to do, like, memorable drag next week, I can give you some tips.

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	So all I need to do is not wear a wig and I'll be told by the judges that I'm pretty.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Babe.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Didn't I remind you guys?  I said, "In about five minutes, she'd make a shady comment out of nowhere"?

DERRICK BARRY	And I did.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	What I said wasn't meant to hurt your feelings.  You're trying to be spiteful.  You see the difference?

DERRICK BARRY	Your intentions weren't to hurt me?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No, they weren't to hurt.  If I wanted to hurt you, you'd be cryin' right now, bitch.

DERRICK BARRY	I will never cry over you at all.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Don't give me a challenge.

DERRICK BARRY	I work on the strip with really big drag personalities.  So if you think you're gonna come for me, I am not that innocent.

SINGER	RuPaul Drag Race.

RUPAUL	The winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race" receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $,.  With extra special guest supermodels Chanel Iman and Gigi Hadid!

SINGER	RuPaul Drag Race.

SINGER	May the best woman, best woman win.

ROBBIE TURNER	Where they chicken wings?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(screams) You know what I love about this process?  I'm becoming, like, a morning person.  I'm up at, like, :, and I'm like, "It's :!"

ROBBIE TURNER	Bob, you're, like, an all day person.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah.

ROBBIE TURNER	You're like, "It's mornin', evenin', and night!  Yeah!  Yeah!"

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm boisterous.  I'm excited to be here.  I'm on my favorite (bleep) TV show.  And that bothers some people.  Sorry, girl.

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Girl.

RUPAUL	She done already done had herses.  Carol Channing, Brittany G.

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo!

RUPAUL	On a game show with a bunch of queens.  Judge Judy, Maggie too…

THORGY THOR	Yes!
RUPAUL	Little Richard, we love you.  Drag queens with an aptitude for thinking fast and being crude.  Don't just stand there.  Let's get to it!  Make me laugh.  There's nothing to it.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

THORGY THOR	Wow.

RUPAUL	Ladies.  For this week's Maxi Challenge, we're going to break out of the studio as we drive along the Hollywood Freeway looking for fresh roadkill.  Then, back in the workroom, you'll need to transform the furry little pelts into evening gowns that scream "#CritterCouture."  Oh, hell, who am I kiddin'?  It's time to play the Snatch Game.

RUPAUL	(laughing) #SnatchGame.  Now, you know how it works.  Impersonate a celebrity, fill in the blanks, and stake your claim as a front-runner in this competition.  Gentlemen, start your engines.  And may the best woman win.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Who you doin', baby?

ACID BETTY	I was gonna do Nancy Grace.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Which is brilliant by the way.

ACID BETTY	Yeah, I think it's funny.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Because she's so, so funny.

ACID BETTY	Over the top.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, she's the craziest.

ACID BETTY	Right.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	And just have outrage at every--everything.

ACID BETTY	Every corner.  I'm impersonating Nancy Grace, herself, because she seems like a major bitch, and I can relate to that.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Robbie, what are you thinkin' about?

ROBBIE TURNER	I'm doing Diana Vreeland.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Who?

ROBBIE TURNER	She was the first editor in chief of "Vogue" in the 's.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh.  Do you think that's a hair obscure?

ROBBIE TURNER	No.  Not at all.  I have been practicing Diana Vreeland for months.  Jinkx Monsoon and Bendelacreme, my Seattle sister wives, won Snatch Game each year that they were on.  So there's a lot of pressure on me to be great.

KIM CHI	What character are you doing?

NAOMI SMALLS	Well, I was going to do Whoopi Goldberg.  "The Color Purple" is, like, one of my favorite movies.  And it's so quotable.  Everyone knows "The Color Purple."

KIM CHI	Yeah.

NAOMI SMALLS	I've been working on it since I found out I was gonna be on the show.  And I cannot wait to be able to prove that I am a performer.  I'm not just a runway queen.

ACID BETTY	Who are you doing?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm torn between Whoopi Goldberg, Uzo Aduba, who is an actress on, um, "Orange Is The New Black"…

ACID BETTY	Oh, yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	And my last choice is probably my favorite, but I look the least like her, is Carol Channing.

ROBBIE TURNER	Why would you do--well.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I know some folks are gonna question why is a '" black man doing Carol Channing, but it's because I feel a connection with Carol Channing.  I really do.

NAOMI SMALLS	See, isn't this not--Miss Celie?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs) You really do look like Miss Celie.

NAOMI SMALLS	I sure is ugly.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I want to show you how much I look like Whoopi Goldberg.

DERRICK BARRY	So Bob basically has, like, ten characters that he could possibly do.  All the sudden, he's got the "Sister Act" outfit on.  He is, like, really giving that Whoopi look.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I think that if you hit a man, a man has the right to knock you out.  You don't want to get hit by a man, don't go around hittin' people.  That's all I'm sayin'.

ACID BETTY	This is gonna be the Whoopi game instead of the Snatch Game.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm realizing, "Oh, (bleep).  I might be out of my league here."  So I'm gonna have to go with my plan B backup.

ROBBIE TURNER	Bob is so excited for Snatch Game, that he's changed his character, like,  times.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I think these are the moves you got to do to be Uzo Aduba.

ROBBIE TURNER	But the brightest bulbs have a way of dimming suddenly or just going out.

RUPAUL	Coming up…  You've got to stay in character, and you've got to make me laugh.

DERRICK BARRY	Hello, Rupaul.  I am here.  My Shocantelle you that I do have a penis.

RUPAUL	Yeah.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	Today's challenge--ding!  Ding!  Ding!  Is gonna be Snatch Game.  It's a celebrity impersonation, so you have to make people laugh.  So I'm gonna be busier than a one-legged cat in a sandbox tryin' to win this challenge.

RUPAUL	Hey, celebrities.

ALL	Hey!

RUPAUL	Are you ready to snatch my attention?

RUPAUL	Hi, Chi Chi.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Mama Ru.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Who are you doing?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm doin' Eartha Kitt.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.  How are you gonna make Eartha funny?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Um, I know that she played Catwoman and I have two cats at home.  I'm just gonna play off…

RUPAUL	Well, that--there it is!  You've got two cats at home.  To play Snatch Game, you've got to stay in character, and you've got to make me laugh.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah.

RUPAUL	All right.  See you out there.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	All right.  Thank you.

RUPAUL	Hi, Kim Chi.  Have you decided on what character you're gonna portray?

KIM CHI	Um, there's two characters I'm debating between.  First one is…Pearl.  Is there something on my face?

RUPAUL	(laughs)

KIM CHI	I started doing drag with Pearl, who was on season , so I know her quirks really well.

RUPAUL	Right.  Right.  And who's your other character?

KIM CHI	The other one is kind of obscure.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

KIM CHI	Kimmy Jong-Un, maybe.

RUPAUL	Kimmy?

KIM CHI	Kimmy, yeah.  Kimmy Jong-Un is a huge risk, but if I turn the North Korean dictator into a drag version of him, it would be a chance for me to show another side of Kim Chi that's a little (bleep) up.

RUPAUL	Huh.  That's interesting.  Listen, whatever works for you.  Just so long as you make me laugh.

ACID BETTY	Kimmy Jong-what?  A made-up character, my friend.  I really hope that lands her in the bottom.

RUPAUL	(sings) Hey, Derrick.

DERRICK BARRY	(sings) Hey, Ru.

RUPAUL	Are you gonna do Brittney?

DERRICK BARRY	It's an obvious choice.  But this is my chance to show everyone that I'm more than just a Brittney impersonator.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

DERRICK BARRY	And so I think I'm gonna go with Laura Bell Bundy's character.

RUPAUL	Yes, she's the country singer Broadway star.

DERRICK BARRY	Right.  And she made up all these characters, and Shocantelle is my favorite one.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

DERRICK BARRY	She is a black girl trapped in a white girl's body.

RUPAUL	Ah.  Can I see a little bit of your Laura Bell Bundy character?

DERRICK BARRY	Hello, Rupaul.  I am here.  My Shocantelle you that I do have a penis.

RUPAUL	You know, sometimes the most obvious thing is the thing to do.  You just have to decide where you want to go.  Stakes are high.  There's $, on the line.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah, that's true.

RUPAUL	All right, Derrick.

DERRICK BARRY	Thank you, Ru.

RUPAUL	Bye.

DERRICK BARRY	Bye.  Oh, lord.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

THORGY THOR	That's me.

RUPAUL	Wait a minute, let me see.  I'm getting, uh, Charles Manson.

THORGY THOR	No.

RUPAUL	No?

THORGY THOR	Uh, I'm doing Michael Jackson.

RUPAUL	How are you gonna make Michael Jackson funny?

THORGY THOR	His little quirks.  His little movements that I have down.

RUPAUL	Yeah.  Who's your biggest competition here?

THORGY THOR	You know, I'm gonna say Bob.  You know, what you're asking us to do in this season, Bob is really excelling at, which is pissing me off.

RUPAUL	Well, let me tell you this, Thorgy.  And this might help you.  You second-guess and you take it into your head.

THORGY THOR	Constantly.

RUPAUL	This is an opportunity for you to feel confident going with your gut and not overthinking things.

THORGY THOR	Yeah.

RUPAUL	All right, Thorgy.  I'll see you out there.

THORGY THOR	Okay.

RUPAUL	All right, ladies.  Gather round.  Tomorrow on the runway, the category is "Night of  Madonnas."

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Madonna has so many iconic looks.  I can't wait to see what everybody comes up with.  It's gonna be amazing.

RUPAUL	So express yourself, 'cause it's a celebration.

RUPAUL	So don't (bleep) it up.

ACID BETTY	Holiday.

RUPAUL	Bye.

NAOMI SMALLS	Bye, Ru.

RUPAUL	Welcome to Snatch Game!  Let's meet our supermodel contestants.  "Vogue" cover girl Chanel Iman.

CHANEL	Hey.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	And "Sports Illustrated" bombshell Gigi Hadid.

GIGI	Hi, Ru.

RUPAUL	Hi, darling.

GIGI	I'm so excited.

RUPAUL	Are you ready to meet our stars?

GIGI	We are.

CHANEL	Yes.

RUPAUL	First up, the king of pop, Michael Jackson.  Was Billie Jean really your lover?

THORGY THOR	I love everyone.  (scatting)

RUPAUL	The king of pop is here.

THORGY THOR	(giggles)

RUPAUL	Next, we have the sister of the supreme leader of North Korea, Kimmy Jong-Un.

KIM CHI	Anyoung haseyo.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Oh, my goodness.  I just know my emails are gonna get hacked after this show airs.  You know what I mean?  (laughs) Next up, television host and former prosecutor, Nancy Grace is here.  Hello, Nancy.

ACID BETTY	You know, I'm worried about the children, Rupaul.  There's reefer smokers influencing them every day.

RUPAUL	All right.  All right.  Up next, legendary "Vogue" fashion editor, Diana Vreeland.

ROBBIE TURNER	Rupaul!

RUPAUL	What's in this season, Diana?

ROBBIE TURNER	How the hell should I know?

RUPAUL	Up next, reality superstar, Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

NAOMI SMALLS	New york is in the mutha-(bleep) house.

RUPAUL	(laughs) up next, Eartha Kitt is here.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	How are you?

RUPAUL	You're not wearing any panties, are you?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Who wears panties?  What are those?

RUPAUL	All right, up next, Britney Jean Spears is here.

DERRICK BARRY	I don't wear panties either.

RUPAUL	You don't wear panties either?

DERRICK BARRY	Especially when I get out of cars.

RUPAUL	All right.  From "Orange Is The New Black", Uzo Aduba is here.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Don't say anything stupid.  Don't say anything stupid.  Uh, how you doin', Rupaul?

RUPAUL	Are you ready to play the game?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm excited.  I don't know why you all gaggin'.  She bring it to you every season.  (sings) Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Snatch Game.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

KIM CHI	I wrote down "weapons of ass destruction."

THORGY THOR	Hee-hee!

DERRICK BARRY	I would be very popular in prison.

RUPAUL	laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome back to Snatch Game.  Here's how the game works.  I ask a question, and you give an answer that you think will match our supermodel contestants.

THORGY THOR	(giggles)

RUPAUL	First question.  Gigi Hadid.  There's a new dating app for drag queens.  When you join, the first question they ask is, "How big is your blank?"  Let's go to Gigi Hadid.

GIGI	How big is your wig?

RUPAUL	I love that!  Let's go to our superstars and find out if you got any matches.

GIGI	Okay.

RUPAUL	Let's start with Kimmy Jong-Un from North Korea.  The first question they ask is, "How big is your"?

KIM CHI	I wrote down "weapons of ass destruction."

RUPAUL	Weapons of ass destruction.  Not a match.  (laughing) I--yeah.  Well, thank you, the unbreakable Kimmy Jong-Un.  Ms. Eartha Kitt.
CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Well, I'm sorry, Gigi…

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	But I said, "big furry balls."

RUPAUL	How big is your big furry balls?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Honey, get your mind out of the gutter.

RUPAUL	Of course.  (laughing)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(purring)

RUPAUL	Prosecutor Nancy Grace.

ACID BETTY	Well, as everybody knows, not only do I do newscasting, but I also was on another show where I danced.  So I said, "How big are your bunions?"

RUPAUL	What do you do for bunions?

ACID BETTY	Well, I was told you can get 'em shaved off.  That's what they do.  I'm about to get that done.

RUPAUL	All right.  Sorry, Gigi.  Not a match.  Let's move on to Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

NAOMI SMALLS	How big is your clock?

RUPAUL	Because drag queens love a big-ass clock, right?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ru seems to be throwing Naomi every bone she can find.

RUPAUL	Do you like a big clock, yourself?
BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	But this dog won't catch.

RUPAUL	Chanel Iman.  It's your turn now, darling.  The big bad wolf is a drag queen.  Instead of huffing, and puffing, and blowing, she blanks the house down.

CHANEL	Shakes?

RUPAUL	She gonna shake the house down.  Shake that ass.

THORGY THOR	Mm.

CHANEL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	All right, well, let's go to our celebrities and find out if you've got a match.  Let's start with Latoya's brother, ichael Jackson.

THORGY THOR	I just said, "Takes a long nap in a bed with everyone they know."

RUPAUL	Michael, that's crazy.

THORGY THOR	Thank you.

THORGY THOR	Mm-hmm.

RUPAUL	Let's move on down to Diana Vreeland.

ROBBIE TURNER	I used to work for "Vogue" magazine.  But I heard that now "Vogue" means a dance.  So I think they vogue the house down.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Girl.  This performance is poo.  And you're from the same town as Jinkx and Dela?  Ooh, girl.  Them girls is gonna--I was about to say they gonna hang you, but I ain't gonna say that.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	Eartha Kitt.  Instead of huffing, puffing and blowing, she blanks the house down.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	She licks the house.

RUPAUL	Ooh.  Licks the house down.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	And speaking of lick, it's time for my bath.

RUPAUL	What?  Oh, you--(laughs)

THORGY THOR	(giggles)

ACID BETTY	Ha, ha.  That's what cats do.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Eartha Kitt didn't do that, Chi Chi.

RUPAUL	Let's move on down to Britney Jean.

DERRICK BARRY	She reads the house down.

RUPAUL	That's not a match, unfortunately, Chanel Iman.  But has Eartha Kitt got your tongue?

DERRICK BARRY	I've had that tongue before.

RUPAUL	You have?

DERRICK BARRY	Good girls gone bad.

RUPAUL	Yeah.

DERRICK BARRY	(sings) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You should do that one more time.

DERRICK BARRY	(sings) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would be very popular in prison.

RUPAUL	All right.  Crazy eyes.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Because you pretty, I just wrote a poem…

RUPAUL	Yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	To Iman.  A-once a queen named Iman remind me of the sun.  Instead of her supermodel life, she can be…my wife.

RUPAUL	Unfortunately, Chanel, that is not a match.  Next question.  Let's go to Gigi Hadid.  Lady bunny has an unusual way of celebrating gay pride.  Instead of the rainbow flag, she hangs her blank out the window.
GIGI	Her tucking panties.

RUPAUL	Let's go to the king of pop and hear if you have a match.

THORGY THOR	Oh, Ru.  It's not a match, but I said, "She waves her blanket."  Say "Hi."

RUPAUL	Oh, hi, blanket.

THORGY THOR	Hi, blanket.  Hi, hi.  Bye-bye.

RUPAUL	Oh, please be careful.  You don't want blanket to fall.  No.

THORGY THOR	Oh, thank you.

RUPAUL	Yes.

THORGY THOR	(scatting)

RUPAUL	Moving on down to Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

NAOMI SMALLS	When I think of pride, I think of…my hair.  So I said $ weave?

RUPAUL	That's an $ weave?

NAOMI SMALLS	Well, of course.  Blended.

RUPAUL	Yes.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yes.

KIM CHI	Naomi's "New York"?

RUPAUL	I'm sorry, Gigi.  You didn't get a match this time.  Maybe next time.  Well, look who's here.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm sorry that I'm late.  But, uh, Uzo Abu-Boo left the stage and she asked me if I would fill in.

RUPAUL	Ladies and gentlemen, Carol Channing.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, thank you.

RUPAUL	All right.  Chanel Iman.  Sally the supermodel is so lactose intolerant, when the photographer says, "Cheese," she blanks.
CHANEL	Sneezes.

RUPAUL	She sneezes!  Let's go down to Nancy Grace.

ACID BETTY	She sends out an amber alert.

DERRICK BARRY	Nancy Grace is terrible.

ACID BETTY	It's important to keep the children safe from the boozers and the users and the reefer smokers.

DERRICK BARRY	It's lifeless.  It's basically Acid Betty turned into Boring Betty.

RUPAUL	Let's move on down to Britney Spears, the princess of pop.

DERRICK BARRY	She, "Oops.  I did it again."

RUPAUL	Ahh.

THORGY THOR	(giggles)

RUPAUL	Do you mean between me down there?

DERRICK BARRY	She had diarrhea.

RUPAUL	All right, let's move on to Diana Vreeland.

ROBBIE TURNER	I've worked with Sally for so long.  She pops a pill, Rupaul.  She pops a pill.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There is so much talk about drugs.  I have-haven't taken anything but Lipitor for the past ten years.  You don't really get a buzz off of that.

RUPAUL	Now, is there an anal option?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I might happen to have a fleet or two in my home.

RUPAUL	A fleet enema.  Now you're talkin' my language.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	If you stay ready, you ain't got to get ready.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	By the way, Eartha, I didn't know that was you down there.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's me, darling.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	From here, I couldn't tell if you were Della Reese or Luther Vandross.  I couldn't see.  These aren't even my good glasses.  But back to the matter at hand.  I just wrote "corn".

RUPAUL	That's always a good answer.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You know, there's no dairy.  And it comes out the way you put it in, Rupaul.

RUPAUL	Well, listen.  On that note, I am sorry, folks, but we are well out of time.  It was a really close game, but the winner is…

RUPAUL	Charo!

CHARO	(screaming)

RUPAUL	She won!

CHARO	I win!

RUPAUL	You won!  She won!

CHARO	(screaming)

RUPAUL	(laughs) Mwah!  Coming up…

GIGI	You were so good.

CARSON	Amazing.

MICHELLE	It was just a fail all the way around.

RUPAUL	Ooh, child.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	What?  I can't believe she…

DERRICK BARRY	Always the first.

KIM CHI	It's elimination day, and it is the night of the  Madonnas.  And as I'm pulling out my kimono, I see Thorgy's also pulling out a red kimono.  Great minds think alike?

THORGY THOR	In New York, it's funny.  It's like we're always put in these boxes of, like, what people's expectations of who we are as, you know, drag artists?
ACID BETTY	Yes.

THORGY THOR	Now, even people are putting Brooklyn in a box.

ACID BETTY	Brooklyn doesn't accept me.  I think there's a lot of queens at home who do not interact with me.  It sucks that none of them ask me to be a part of their community.  So I don't fit in anywhere.  There are certain definitions of "drag."  You know, and there's, like, "I'm put in it 'cause I'm the 'look queen.'"  I've had fights with those people where they're like, "Oh, you're not a drag queen.  You just do looks."

THORGY THOR	Yes.  Mm-hmm.

ACID BETTY	It hurts me, actually, that I'm a lone soldier.  And I think that's that huge wall that I put in between me and myself and everybody else.  I think this show's a great platform, though, because it kind of shows that we do something more than just stand around and serve booze.

THORGY THOR	Yup.

ACID BETTY	You know, or sit around and be a bitch.

THORGY THOR	Yeah.  You know, I do all these shows.  I make all these things.  But I'm also a musician.  What I really want to do is, like, do a grand, like, event, like, "Thorgy and the thorchestra."

ACID BETTY	Fabulous.

THORGY THOR	Like, a -piece orchestra, and I want to conduct in drag.  I am a professional violinist, violist, cellist.  You know, I've played at Carnegie Hall many times.  I feel like I'm the perfect medium to kind of appeal to, like, the younger generation and make classical music cool.  It's a throwback to, like, events where, like, you dressed up just to get on the red carpet.

ACID BETTY	I love that.

NAOMI SMALLS	Do you have any siblings, Bob?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I have two brothers, actually.

NAOMI SMALLS	Uh-huh.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	How many do you have?

NAOMI SMALLS	I have eight brothers and three sisters.

DERRICK BARRY	Whoa.

ACID BETTY	That is crazy.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You said you were adopted?

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Did they have a talk where they were, like, "You know--" where they went, like, one day, like, "Well, just so you know."

NAOMI SMALLS	Well, it's--like it's very obvious that I'm adopted.  These are my parents.  So growing up with white parents.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	A rainbow family.

NAOMI SMALLS	Like, this is my mom.

DERRICK BARRY	She's gorgeous.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah, she's, like, the best mom ever.  I'm literally the only gay one in my family.  And I have a Christian background, and I've heard stories of kids being shunned from the family and all that.  And my mom has done nothing but make me feel accepted.  And, she's just an amazing woman.  I love my mom.  Growing up, I literally had, like, the best parents and best childhood.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Did you ever feel a--a need to just study up on black stuff?

NAOMI SMALLS	Kind of.  It wasn't a weird thing until I got to high school, middle school.  People were throwing out all these, like, black references.  And I was, like, "Wait.  What does that mean?"  Did you grow up with, like, black culture was, like, second-hand?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I grew up in an all-black family.  I went to all-black high school, all-black elementary school and a majority black middle school.

NAOMI SMALLS	Like, I get called "Oreo," like, all the time.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's obnoxious.

NAOMI SMALLS	Or, like, "Oh, he's kind of cute for a black guy."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, don't even get me started on being cute for a black guy.  It's kind of a--it's really obnoxious.

KIM CHI	Wait, I think you're kind of cute for a black guy, Naomi.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you, Kimberly Chi.

KIM CHI	Kind of, though.

SINGER	(laughs) Cover girl, put the bass in your walk.  Head to toe, let your whole body talk and, what?

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "Rupaul's Drag Race."  The world's biggest Madonna fan, Michelle Visage.

MICHELLE	You must be my lucky star.

RUPAUL	A guy who's game for anything, Carson Kressley.  Now, who would you do in the Snatch Game?

CARSON	I would impersonate, um, like, maybe a man.  Like, Michelle Visage.

RUPAUL	The gorgeous Gigi Hadid.  Now, is it more fun to hang out with models or drag queens?

GIGI	Well, I've never had this much fun at a runway show, so, drag queens, of course.

RUPAUL	And the stunning Chanel Iman.  Did you have a good time yesterday?
CHANEL	Yes.  It was everything.

RUPAUL	(laughs) This week, our queens channeled showbiz greats, as they went for Snatch Game gold.  And tonight, my girls are ready to take a bow, because bitch!  They're Madonna.  Gentlemen, start your engines.  And may the best woman win.

SINGER	The realness.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

CARSON	Crouching tiger, hidden drag queen.

RUPAUL	Nothing really matters.

MICHELLE	No, sure doesn't.

THORGY THOR	As I'm walking down the runway, I'm giving you, like, angular, interesting artistic movements, and I'm feeling it.

GIGI	Undercover geisha.

RUPAUL	Oh, kimono, she better don't.  Up next, Kim Chi.  Oh.

GIGI	Two in a row.

KIM CHI	I have a gorgeous vintage wedding kimono.  But I wish I wasn't wearing the same thing as Thorgy.

RUPAUL	She's servin' that walk, Michelle.

MICHELLE	She is.

CARSON	W-o-k.

RUPAUL	Yeah.  Derrick Barry.  Nothing really matters.  The remix.

MICHELLE	Yes.

DERRICK BARRY	I'm walking down in the most original kimono.  It's hand-painted, and I feel like this is a standout piece.

MICHELLE	Is that sidewalk talk?

RUPAUL	Jean Paul Gaultier.  (sings) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  (talks) Naomi Smalls.

GIGI	Oh, again.

RUPAUL	Yeah, these girls are really hung up on kimonos.

NAOMI SMALLS	I didn't think anybody else was going to choose kimono Madonna.  I'm trying to own this even though three other girls are in the exact same look.

CARSON	Kung Fu fightin'.

GIGI	This is, like, the Victoria's Secret section of Madonna.

CARSON	I like that material, girl.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty.

CARSON	She's keepin' her baby.

RUPAUL	It may have a few holes in it, but…

ACID BETTY	My Madonna look today is from "Bedtime Stories," where she's pregnant, giving birth to doves.  This outfit represents who I am, because obviously I'm the only one creative enough to think of it.

CARSON	I think she just flipped us the bird.

GIGI	Bye, bye, birdie.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turnter.

CARSON	She's in a league of her own.

RUPAUL	There's no crying in baseball, Robbie!

ROBBIE TURNER	I feel so cute.  I've got my cute little dress.  It's all hand-painted with my little patches.


RUPAUL	I wonder if she's a pitcher or a catcher.

MICHELLE	Me too.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi Devayne.  You're gonna poke somebody's eyes out with those things.

MICHELLE	If you're lucky.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	When you think of Madonna, you think of the cone bra.  Bitch, I look good.

RUPAUL	Oh, yeah.  It's--she's totally expressing herself.  I think she likes a little hanky-panky.  Bob the drag queen.

MICHELLE	Oh!

RUPAUL	Not to be confused with Bob the camp counselor.

GIGI	I love.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	My favorite Madonna look is Madonna at the GLAAD awards when she dressed like a boy scout.  And it is a huge political statement.  And I'm not in a kimono!

CARSON	Get a load of those girl scout cookies.

MICHELLE	Yes!

RUPAUL	And she earned a badge for walking children in nature.

SINGER	The realness.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

MICHELLE	You could have gone so much bigger with her.

CARSON	You are like a white Chaka Khan.

MICHELLE	So you did Britney, huh?

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)


RUPAUL	Welcome, ladies.  When I call your name, please step forward and strike a pose.

MICHELLE	(whispers indistinctly)

RUPAUL	Kim Chi.  Chi Chi Devayne.  You're both safe.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Thank you.

RUPAUL	You may leave the stage.  Oh, the power of good-bye.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Ladies, it's time for the judges' critiques.

MICHELLE	Tonight on the runway, I don't know if you guys had some kind of symbiotic message to each other, but there's a lot of kimonos which is very interesting.  Thorgy, you did your take on it.  You kept it in geisha, but still Thorgy's in there.

CARSON	The Michael Jackson was so good.  I loved all of it.

GIGI	You kept character better than anyone.

CHANEL	It was everything for me.

RUPAUL	Up next, Acid Betty.

MICHELLE	I was not expecting to see "Bedtime Stories" and the whole bird-fly-out thing.  So kudos to that.

ACID BETTY	Thank you.

MICHELLE	I think your make-up is okay tonight.  It's nothing spectacular.  But where I was really let down, was in the Snatch Game, Betty.

CARSON	It didn't look like her.  It was like the wig and the make-up, you were like a white Chaka Khan.

MICHELLE	I didn't get any Nancy Grace from it.  It felt like you were just being you.  It was just a fail all the way around.

ACID BETTY	I wasn't sure how to turn such a serious woman funny.

CARSON	I needed like a nasal, angry southern voice.  And then she leans in, and she wants to talk to you on the TV like she's in your living room.

ACID BETTY	I wish I had you as a coach.

CARSON	Okay.

RUPAUL	All right.  Up next, Robbie Turnter.

CHANEL	I really enjoyed your catwalk because it was really fun and playful.

GIGI	I was really excited about Diana.  And I--I think that most people may not know who that is.  So I think that how iconic she was, and the voice and everything, you kind of have to shove that in people's faces for them to get it.

MICHELLE	You could have gone so much bigger with her.

ROBBIE TURNER	Punk took my voice away.  My voice kept cracking, and I was going in and out during Diana Vreeland.

RUPAUL	Well, we could hear you perfectly.  It's just, we weren't impressed with what was being said.  Up next, Naomi Smalls.

MICHELLE	It's becoming quite predictable for Naomi to come out in basically, lingerie.  This is where we go, "Oh, maybe I should switch it up now."

GIGI	In Snatch Game, I got lost with the boobs.  I think if you would have just stuffed it to the max, it would of made the character a lot more obvious to me.

MICHELLE	That was your moment to go O-T-P.

NAOMI SMALLS	I was very underwhelmed with my performance.  It was not coming out, and I'm, like, so embarrassed bout it.

RUPAUL	All right.  Thank you, Naomi.  Up next, Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	So we did Britney, huh?  I am so grateful.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, god.

MICHELLE	You done good, girl.

CHANEL	Me and Gigi really, really loved your Britney performance yesterday.

GIGI	You kept character the whole time.  You just were Britney.

DERRICK BARRY	Thank you so much.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Derrick.  Bob The Drag Queen.

MICHELLE	Tonight, on the runway.  Love it.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I love your Madonna look too.  And I know you're a huge Madonna fan.  And, like, one of your biggest thing you said, was when Madonna sent you, like, a cease and desist?

MICHELLE	Yes!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Best moment of my life.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

CARSON	The padding.  It's so good, I wouldn't have known.

RUPAUL	You are serving "womana."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	This old luscious body.

CARSON	The Snatch Game.  Uzo Aduba, amazing.

GIGI	You were so good.

CARSON	Then, we get a little Carol Channing.  You gave us extra, which was wonderful.

MICHELLE	I do want to caution you, however.  Sometimes you borderline on showboating.  Just keep that in the back of your mind.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Mm-hmm.

RUPAUL	All right, ladies.  Well, I think we've heard enough.  While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.  All right.  Now, just between us material squirrels.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	What do you think?  Thorgy Thor.

CARSON	Her Michael Jackson, I thought was divine.

MICHELLE	She was really good at making fun of things that are a little taboo.

GIGI	She stayed in character the entire time.  I really felt like Michael was there.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty.

CHANEL	Her runway was very creative.

MICHELLE	But her Nancy Grace was more like Nancy Disgrace.

RUPAUL	Ooh, child.

MICHELLE	How does a drag queen do Nancy Grace and she doesn't even have the wig right?

CARSON	You need a little helmet-y blonde.  And then you need a few little Nancy Grace-isms.  And none of that happened.  It was just like, she didn't even know who Nancy Grace was.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turnter.

CARSON	The "League Of Their Own" look stood out from the rest.  I would give it a B plus.

RUPAUL	We love Diana Vreeland.

MICHELLE	We do, indeed.  Everything was wrong about it.  Why didn't she go for the blown-back hair?

RUPAUL	Yes!  With the--with the bump at the top.

MICHELLE	Yes!  The worst part of the whole thing tonight with Robbie, was the--(coughs feebly) (whispers) "I have no voice."

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

MICHELLE	All of a sudden, you don't have a voice anymore?  And I think she needs to get out of her head and get into my car.

RUPAUL	Okay.  All right, Billy Ocean.  Naomi Smalls did Tiffany Pollard.  New york.

MICHELLE	She didn't do New York.

RUPAUL	She did not do New York.

CARSON	She wasn't New York.  She wasn't Connecticut.  She wasn't New Jersey.  She wasn't Long Island.  I don't know what she was.

GIGI	But, Naomi's was my favorite of the kimonos.  She made me want to wear it, but I don't know if it really screamed "Madonna."

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

GIGI	The Britney blew me away.  I was so excited for every time that she was going to answer a question.

CARSON	The runway thing, I always find her a bit timid on the runway.

CHANEL	When you're on the catwalk, you've got to just give it all you got.

RUPAUL	You know, I once asked Iman what is on her mind on the runway.  And she looked at me dead in the eyes and said, "Africa."

CARSON	That's what I do when I go to bars.

RUPAUL	Oh, really?  (laughs)

CARSON	Yes.  Think about Africa.

RUPAUL	Oh-kerr!

CARSON	Oh--(trills, clicks tongue)

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

MICHELLE	She flipped the script.  Come back as an African-American Carol Channing doing a fabulous impersonation of her.

RUPAUL	Right.

GIGI	And the Madonna thing, it was the most well put together thought-out costume.  I didn't even know leg pads were a thing.

RUPAUL	There's a lot goin' on on the stage that would blow your mind, Gigi.

MICHELLE	Uh-huh.

GIGI	Show-and-tell backstage after?

RUPAUL	Oh, I don't know if you ready.

RUPAUL	(claps) Silence!  I've made my decision.  Bring back my girls…(whispers) now.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome back, ladies.  I've made some decisions.  Thorgy Thor.  Your Michael Jackson was off the wall.  And your Madonna look was something to remember.  Bob The Drag Queen.  I's was crazy about your Snatch Game.  And on the runway, you are one unapologetic bitch.  Bob The Drag Queen, condragulations, you are the winner of this week's challenge.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.  Thank you.

RUPAUL	You've won a collection of handbags and wallets from Lux De Ville valued at $,.

CARSON	Wow.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs) Wow.  Whoo!  I took a risk, and it paid off.

RUPAUL	Bob and Thorgy, you may join the other girls.  Derrick Barry.  You are safe.

DERRICK BARRY	Thank you.  Thank you so much.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty, your runway was an immaculate conception.  But your Nancy Grace left us asking, "Who's that girl?"  I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.

ACID BETTY	I totally agree with Snatch Game.  It sucked.  But I think Snatch Game sucks.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turner, your runway was a hit.  But your Snatch Game was a swing and a miss.  Naomi smalls, your runway look was borderline.  But your impersonation of "New York" bordered on "New Jersey."  Naomi Smalls.  I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.  Robbie Turner, you are safe.

ROBBIE TURNER	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Two queens stand before me.  As always, I've consulted with the judges.  But quite frankly, I don't give a (bleep) what they say.  Because the final decision is mine to make.  Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination.  The time has come for you to lip-synch for your life!  (echoes) Life!

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm not about to go home to Acid Betty.  I'm gonna bring it, and I'm gonna do everything I can to send this bitch home.

RUPAUL	Good luck, and don't (bleep) it up.

SINGER	I've got the moves, baby.  You got the motion.  If we got together, we'd be causing a commotion.  Someday, you'll see my point of view.

ACID BETTY	I'm pregnant with birds coming out of my belly, and now I have to lip-synch for my life?  I'm ready to make TV history.
SINGER	Work for you.  You've got to make the compromise, and maybe then, we can keep our love alive, and when it falls, we won't let it die.  It doesn't matter if you win or lose.  It's how you play the game.  So get into the groove.
NAOMI SMALLS	All you hear is music.  You have no idea what's happening around you.  And in that moment, you will do whatever it takes to stay.

SINGER	Commotion.  I hope you find what you're looking for.  Is it mine?  Walk through that door.  We're wasting time.  Make up your mind and get into the groove.  I got the moves, baby.  You got the motion.  If we got together, we'd be causing a commotion, causing a commotion, causing a commotion.
ALL	Yeah!

RUPAUL	adies.  I've made my decision.  Naomi Smalls, shantay, you stay.

NAOMI SMALLS	Oh.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty.  You've taken us on one wild trip.  Thanks for the high.

ACID BETTY	Thank you for the opportunity.  It's been amazing.  And I'm so happy to be a part of royalty now.

RUPAUL	Now, sashay away.

ACID BETTY	I love you guys.  Acid Betty out!  I'm so happy that I came here.  I would not change this for anything.  Legends are born in "RuPaul's Drag Race".  And now I'm officially a legend.  Bitches beware.  'Cause Acid Betty is now being released to the world.  And it's gonna be trouble from here on out.

RUPAUL	My seven rays of light.  You live to die another day.  And remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?  Can I get an "amen" in here?

ALL	Amen.

RUPAUL	All right.  Now, let the music play.

SINGER	Die tomorrow, live tonight.  Die tomorrow, live tonight.  Die tomorrow, live tonight.
