CUSTOM OFFICER 1	Turn off your engine.

CUSTOM OFFICER 1	Where are you coming from?

KOKOUVI	From the factory down the road there, sir.

CUSTOM OFFICER 1	Down where?

KOKOUVI	Dacula. The rubber factory, officer.

CUSTOM OFFICER 1	What is there?

KOKOUVI	There's nothing, really. Just rubber blocks, officer.

CUSTOM OFFICER 1	You say what?

KOKOUVI	Rubber blocks!

CUSTOM OFFICER 1	Come down from the vehicle.

KOKOUVI	But I just told you, it's rubber blocks!

CUSTOM OFFICER 1	Come down from the vehicle.

CUSTOM OFFICER 1	Take him there!

KOKOUVI	It's rubber blocks, officer. There's nothing there.

CUSTOM OFFICER 2	Open it!

CUSTOM OFFICER 2	Open!

KOSSI	The world is designed to protect children. We are the last pure entity left.

KOKOUVI	Sorry, sorry, my phone.

CUSTOM OFFICER 3	Hello. Yes. Yes.

KOSSI	But when you are from Gbangbale, Togo... no one gives a flying, running, crawling fuck. Even parents sell their children away for a few meals around here.  Our generation was supposed to stay nothing.

KOSSI	I was sold to this house, maybe rent... but master did not want me here.

MRS. MARTINS	There’s a civil war going on where that boy just came from.

MR. MARTINS	Uh-huh?

MRS. MARTINS	I'll say we're doing his family a huge favor by taking him in.

MR. MARTINS	The boy is from Togo! The only civil war going on in Togo right now darling, is in your head!

MRS. MARTINS	But honey...

MR. MARTINS	No, honey. Let the boy go back to where he came from. And that’s final.


MRS. MARTINS	Final? I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that. I brought that boy into this house for one reason... to keep this house clean. If his family wanted him around, I'm sure that’s where he would be. Stop trying to save the world and mind your own business.

MR. MARTINS	My house, so it is kind of my business, no?

MRS. MARTINS	Correction! This is OUR house! May I suggest, you send in your notice at work... learn how to cook and clean-It’s called house husbanding!

MR. MARTINS	Ridiculous!

MRS. MARTINS	Yes! It’s not such a taboo anymore... darling!

MR. MARTINS	Thanks, honey!

KOSSI	She is the real master. So, I stay.

KOSSI	There was this bully from Japan that her brother cannot protect her from.  I promised that I will destroy this bully, so she became my best friend. Her name is Oyin. And on the other hand... His name... is Bastard.

KOSSI	I forgot to mention that I used to play this game with the missionaries back in Gbangbale

KOSSI	It was after this game... master sir told me that my mother died.

KOSSI	Oyin helped me plan my escape. I have to go and save my mother’s fish.

KOSSI	So, I stayed. Fifteen years!

KOSSI	I read somewhere that you should never trust a man ...

OYIN	Even if that man is your fiancé? Kossi please, I don’t want to talk about this anymore.

KOSSI	Look! This is why you want to leave. What will I do?

OYIN	Plenty! All you have to do is sort out  Femi’s big head... and you’ll have time to spend with Emma, Kachi and Muhtar, and oh! Maybe you can finally start dating that secret girl you've refused to tell me about.

KOSSI	I cannot be with her now.

OYIN	Why not?

KOSSI	See, the things men should know about women... men don’t have the time to learn. And if they have the time, they definitely don’t have the money. So, where does that leave  someone like me?

OYIN	Kossi! The things that come out of your mouth...  amazing.

KOSSI	It's Kossi!

FEMI	Fuck! Come in!

KOSSI	You called me.

FEMI	I fucking know that. Wash the stain off that. Put some towels by the pool.	

KOSSI	Hello. My name is Kossi.	

SONIA	Okay?	

KOSSI	Do you want something to drink?

FEMI	Hey! Will you get the fuck away from there! You crazy?

KOSSI	Emmanuel is from my village... he always dress nice, even in his uniform. His master, the professor likes him like the son he never had. He even taught him how to speak like him.

EMMANUEL	You know that sometimes where you live... determines if you live. There was no hope for us in Gbangbale!

KOSSI	And this is hope?  Tell me, Emma. Show me. I should have done everything  for them not to bring me into this country. I should have held onto a knife, I should have fought. I shouldn’t have done nothing!

EMMANUEL	You're acting as if this is the end of the world. This is not the end of the world. Even the end of the world is not the end of the world!

KOSSI	Emma, but it could be the end of me!

EMMANUEL	Well, you're here now... and you’re a man. So, what are you going to do about it?

KOSSI	Everything!

EMMANUEL	Like what? Leave? Go back to Togo?

KOSSI	What?! What the fuck is wrong with you, Emma? Huh?! Togo?! See, the only way I'm going back is in a private jet and a baggage full of money!

EMMANUEL	So, bye bye Togo.

KOSSI	I cannot stay another day as a slave to that shithead! It is time. First thing tomorrow morning I'm leaving that house for good. My real life starts now!

EMMANUEL	So, what? You leave the house and become homeless?

KOSSI	I did not fucking go anywhere... but, I started to make some moves. I was looking for how to make money and I saw the story of a man who printed ten million U.S. dollars! In his house! With just a computer, printer, a sample of a hundred-dollar bill and his brain! I decided to look into this... and I was blown away by the world’s money system. You know, printing fake money is one of the oldest crimes in the world. But, what if I told you that the biggest fake-money printer in the world is actually the government?

KACHI	House boy!

KOSSI	Bloody factory worker. Kachi, see... you remember this paper that I took from you the other time?

KACHI	What?

KOSSI	That paper. The one I said feels like money.

KACHI	Oh yeah, rag paper. Why?


KOSSI	I need some.

KACHI	You can’t just get rag paper like that!

KOSSI	Kachi, there has to be a way!

KACHI	Yeah, actually there is! Go to the Central Bank of Nigeria, ask the MD to give you some. Look Kossi, I have to go, I’m busy.

KOSSI	Kachi!

KOSSI	The United-States Treasury actually put out a paper telling you the security features to look for in a real dollar. This is like the teacher giving you answers to the exam. But the paper is the foundation of everything... without paper, I have nothing. Only banks and top paper manufacturing companies have the license to produce this paper... and every single sheet  must be accounted for. Lucky for me, Kachi works at a printing press. He knew another friend that works for a top paper manufacturing company. He was the only hope.  It took a few weeks, but Kachi finally agreed to talk to his friend. And it took his friend another three weeks to get into some money trouble. He finally caved.

KACHI	He said when he comes out... we have ten minutes to do whatever we need to go in and do.

KOSSI	And you want me to go in there and steal papers? But you tell me that you have a friend that has papers.

KACHI	Well, when I told you he works here, that is not a lie.

KOSSI	Kachi, it's like you telling me that someone is in the film business... and you get to find out that they're just security at the cinema!

KACHI	Well, that puts him in the film business!

KOSSI	Kachi, what the actual fuck?!

KACHI	Kossi, time is ticking... The alarm will be coming back on in 10 minutes... so, we either stand here and argue or go in and get the paper for only God knows what you need them for! I don't even know why I'm standing here!  I just...

KOSSI	For everything else...

STREET GUY 1	You want to buy Euros? You want to buy the stuff? You're buying the stuff.

KOSSI	The underground dark web of Lagos... perhaps Africa. Here, for a fee, fake passports, visas of any kind, anyone’s house papers, LPOs, Jesus’s birth certificate, a baby, you get the idea? You can get your hands on anything.

KOSSI	Along with the information I found on the government website, I was able to move ahead. I spent many months working on the look of the money. If this is going to work, first thing first, it must look like money. Then, I worked down the list. But of all the security features on any bill... the most powerful test it must go through is the one most people do everyday without even knowing it. When you collect money, your fingers send a secret signal of validation to your brain to put you at ease. This I found, there is no bigger test.

EMMANUEL	It feels like Paper.

KOSSI	Emma, don’t be stupid! Is it a book paper or a magazine paper or what?

EMMANUEL	Book paper! Look, can I open my eyes now?

EMMANUEL	You cut out paper? Why?! You’re going crazy, man!

KOSSI	Emmanuel was right. I was going crazy. They say practice makes perfect, but this is a lie. Practice makes good. Only obsession makes perfect. 

KOSSI	My money looks like the real money, but it doesn't feel like it. I tried everything. I raised the ink levels, neutralized the starch even more. I soaked it in different solutions, I put it in the microwave, I stored it underground to bake! But every time, my fingers knew that they were not holding money. It was becoming more clear... I had to find another way to make money. 

KOSSI	In all of this...I hadn’t been there for Oyin. She was going through a very difficult time. One year ago... she said yes to marrying this man that I never liked from the first time I saw him.

OYIN	He has proof that him cheating  on me was the work of the devil.

KOSSI	Today... she will return that ring. 

KOSSI	For the first time in 8 months... my fingers finally sent that secret signal to my brain.

KOSSI	The secret ingredient that had been missing all along.

FEMI	I don’t have my glasses on!

SONIA	You don’t have your glasses on?!

FEMI	Come in! What the fuck is wrong with you? I thought I told you to clean this place yesterday!

SONIA	You don’t have your fucking glasses on?!

KOSSI	Yes!

FEMI	What, then somehow you managed to miss that?!

SONIA	Oh! Now, you found your glasses!

KOSSI	I did the cleaning myself, it wasn’t there. I did not see this.

FEMI	What are you still doing there?! Will you pick that shit up and leave! Where the hell do you think you're going to?

KOSSI	I want to go and get a packer.

FEMI	Will you freaking pick that shit up and get the fuck out of here!

EMMANUEL	Hey! Hey! Don't use your hands! You have crocodile hands. I have my own.

KOSSI	Me? Fuck you!

EMMANUEL	I'm just saying.

KOSSI	You hear me? Fuck you!

EMMANUEL	How much is this?!

KOSSI	I'm working on something...and I will need you. Actually, I can even get you a room.

EMMANUEL	I already have my own room.

KOSSI	With air condition and tv.

EMMANUEL	I'll tell you what...you get me a room, in this city, no tv, no air condition, nothing! Just a room. Four walls... I'll move in with you. I will cook for you, I will clean for you. I will even be your girlfriend.

KOSSI	Fuck you! This is not even funny.

EMMANUEL	And you getting a house? Not funny!

KOSSI	But, what if I do... Do we have a deal?

EMMANUEL	Yes! We have a deal.

EMMANUEL	(Chuckles) I'm getting a room!

STREET GUY 2	What did he do?

KOSSI	What did he steal?

STREET GUY 3	He tried to exchange fake dollars.

KOSSI	Are you trying to kill him?!

ABUBAKAR	He's a thief! The last time, they put somebody out of seventy thousand... Okay, you need change. Wait... move him over there! Move him! I'm coming back, now.

ABUBAKAR	Take! We don't like thieves around here! Death to any thief I get my hands on!

KOSSI	This is the moment I mentally resigned as a houseboy. I just needed the rest of me to catch up.

SONIA	Yes?

KOSSI	How are you?

SONIA	Look... if Femi sent you here to apologize for him...

KOSSI	No, I didn’t come here for anybody. Just me.

KOSSI	I know you're wondering... “What is this houseboy doing on my chair?" But, here’s a story, ah...

KOSSI	In a very tiny village in Togo... there was this little boy, by far, he was the brightest kid they had ever seen. Even the missionaries saw this too! YOVO! That's what we called them. They wanted to take him to Paris... they knew with the right opportunities he was going straight to the top!

KOSSI	But the mother never liked Yovo... they take black people away, they use them for sacrifice and that is why they live all this glorious lives. According to her.

KOSSI	You're beautiful. You’re a bear,  just like me. I'll call you, "Mama Bear". You know, I never liked anyone in my life, before. I'm liking only you. I am a business man, and I'm going to make a lot of money. Very soon. The kind of money that you would like to come around. Mama Bear... I am going to come for you. Thank you for your time. One more thing. You forgot this at the house.

KOSSI	If you are ever interested in  meeting real-life clowns... look for any property agent in Lagos. They are from another planet.

PROPERTY AGENT	Is it really for you? 

PROPERTY AGENT	It's a 'No'?

PROPERTY AGENT	This is one of the two bedrooms... two of them en suite and one is currently being...

PROPERTY AGENT	It's another 'No'?

KOSSI	Tell me more about this place.

PROPERTY AGENT	It has 3 bedrooms. All en suite... as you can see, this is a great living room space. hard to find in an area like this, for the price. The kitchen is spacious. You'll not have to beg your lady before she cooks for you. And in thanking her... let me show you the master bedroom.

KOSSI	What is the final price of this place?

PROPERTY AGENT	If you are serious, I mean ready like right now...

KOSSI	At this point... I was making five hundred dollars every day!

MR. MARTINS	This unannounced visit is actually about Kossi... Yes. I suspect that living outside the chaos of city life has made us to reflect better on life. And on decisions we may have made that may not have been for the best. 

MRS. MARTINS	Your father and I, we feel like we've maybe not handled the Kossi situation in the best of ways. The long and short of it is we're releasing him.

MR. MARTINS	Yeah.

OYIN	Releasing him?

MR. MARTINS	Uh-huh.

OYIN	To what?

MR. MARTINS	To go back to Togo and to choose whatever he wants to do with his life. He’s a relatively young chap and It’s certainly better now as opposed to later.

MRS. MARTINS	But don't worry... we've hired a proper maid service. They'll come, cook, clean, take care of the house.

OYIN	What?! Does he even know anybody in Togo? Kossi is as Nigerian as anybody that I know! I'm sorry, but this doesn’t make sense!

MR. MARTINS	Mind your tone, young lady.

MR. MARTINS	We have already considered that and we have made arrangements to ease his transition. We've already bought him a plane ticket! 

MRS. MARTINS	And we have a severance package of five hundred thousand Naira! To help him sustain himself until he figures out what he wants to do.

FEMI	And this is why we’re having this conversation? Really? I mean, who cares? It’s Kossi. He’s useless. He smells!

MRS. MARTINS	Femi!

MR. MARTINS	You see what you have raised?

MRS. MARTINS	What I raised?

MR. MARTINS	Yes! I raised this one,  you raised that one.

MRS. MARTINS	Dear, let's not start.

FEMI	Well, it’s been real. Good luck.

OYIN	You have my email and my number. Call me the second you get there. I’m going to miss you so much, Kossi. I love you.

CAB DRIVER	So, you're a house boy?! And your face looks like this? You've eaten a pig! Look at him! House boy with pink lips.

CAB DRIVER	Where are you traveling to? Won't you answer me?! I asked where you're traveling to!

KOSSI	I'm going to Togo.

CAB DRIVER	Togo! Togo, Togo! You're going to Togo... and you're carrying a refugee bag.

CAB DRIVER	You're traveling out of the country? Like this?! Like this?! No problem. My only concern is to drop you off at the airport. Then they can do with you  whatever they like. Help me fix the mirror well! The side mirror,  do it!  Closer! I want to provoke you to talk!

KOSSI	Don't provoke me!

CAB DRIVER	Talk!

KOSSI	Must we talk?!

CAB DRIVER	You must talk!

KOSSI	Why?!

CAB DRIVER	Because I want you to talk! I'm happy! I provoked him! "What's all this? What's all this?" Togo, Togo! 

EMMANUEL	Can you tell me what the hell is going on?! We've just missed our flight! We left our cab with our bags inside.

KOSSI	We didn’t miss any flight. We didn’t miss any flight. That was not my own flight. You understand. Taking me back to what?!

EMMANUEL	Togo!

KOSSI	To Togo?! You want to go back to Togo?! You want to go back to Togo,  what do you know about Togo?! See, I’m working on something,  right now... and all I need from you is your loyalty and trust. And if all these things is too much for you to carry,  you can go back, now!

KOSSI	I got us a beautiful place, you will love it. But first... one more stop.

KOSSI	Changing one hundred dollar bill is one thing... but changing...

ABUBAKAR	Ten thousand! You're holding big money now, my friend. That's good.

KOSSI	Maybe I should go somewhere else.

ABUBAKAR	No no no no... See... Even if you go, you'll come back. Our price is the best. I swear to God. Please sit down. Sit down, please.

ABUBAKAR	Just one minute. One minute.

ABUBAKAR	My friend! There's a problem. You see this your dollar... is 1996. This is the recent one. It's always ten naira less. I'm saying the truth, ask anybody. It's ten naira less.

PROPERTY AGENT	Pleasure doing business with you!

KACHI	Kossi, you live here now?

KOSSI	This is me... Head of Operations. I am in charge... Emmanuel, this is you. Muhtar and Kachi, you're here. Emmanuel will follow my orders... and you two will follow Emmanuel's orders. The way it is on the board... it is the exact way that it's going to be, but... We are all the same. We are all the same. If we do these things very well, we're heading straight to the top! Kachi... You may have to resign, yeah?

KACHI	Done! How much are they paying me?

MUHTAR	I'll resign, too.

EMMANUEL	From what?

KACHI	You don't have a job, Muhtar!

MUHTAR	I mean, I'll stop looking...

KACHI	Shut up, Muhtar!

KOSSI	But first! First thing first... Image! You see all these rags that we are wearing. We have to put them all together and burn them to ashes. Burn everything! We need to look the part. Because, when people see us... they think we're rich. And when we give them money, they won't even have any reason to think at all. Please... choose your own style. Do not look like anybody.  Because you're at your best... when you are yourself.

KOSSI	I saw this place on Mama Bear’s phone. So, it must classy.

KOSSI	Ahh! I like everything!

KOSSI	Excuse me! How much is this bag?

SALES GIRL	Very good choice. It's five thousand, five hundred dollars, only.

DELIVERY GIRL	Hello!

IFY	Hello!

DELIVERY GIRL	We have a delivery for Miss. Sonia Badu.

IFY	Where's it?

DELIVERY GIRL	We have to see an ID, please.

MAN ON TELEVISION	I really can't keep up. When did stupid become a style?

SONIA	Hey! What's going on, that's my bag!

IFY	There's a delivery for you.

SONIA	A what?

IFY	Delivery!

MAN 2 ON TELEVISION	And you spoke with Don Jazzy? Man, the only Don you've ever had anything to do with is Don Simon!

DELIVERY GIRL	Thank you!

DELIVERY MAN	Have a good day, madam.

IFY	Thank you!

IFY	Sonia!

SONIA	Do you mind?!

IFY	Is Femi in the doghouse?

SONIA	Even if!

SONIA	Ify! I can hear your brain breathe!

IFY	Oh my God!

IFY	Did Femi send this?

IFY	Mama Bear? Papa Bear? You better start talking, Sonia.

SONIA	(Sighs) It's Femi’s house boy.

SONIA	What if he stole it?

IFY	Did you see how it was delivered? It came straight from the store. He paid for this. But you know... if you don't want it I can just take it.

KACHI	What is this thing?

EMMANUEL	This?! This is champagne!

MUHTAR	It tastes like water from raw pap. You will like it.

KOSSI	You know how all those suicide bombers are supposed to get virgins when they get to paradise... this is paradise! And you don’t have to bomb anybody. Just come to Lagos.

KACHI	Best part... none of them are virgins.

MUHTAR	Yeah! Very true.

KOSSI	How the fuck you know, man?

MUHTAR	Me?

KOSSI	Not you. I’m talking to your grandfather’s spirit.

KACHI	This is the closest you have ever been to any girl, not fully dressed, Muhtar.	

MUHTAR	Me?

KOSSI	Again... not you.

KACHI	Look at that girl, right there!

KOSSI	Muhtar! You wanna go talk to her?

EMMANUEL	Go!

KACHI	It’s easy! Just tell her what you like about her.

MUHTAR	Don’t teach me nothing. I know what to do!

MUHTAR	Pay attention!

KOSSI	Shabba!

MUHTAR	Hello, how are you? Hello...

KOSSI	And as we were having the time of our lives... this was happening on the other side of town.

CAPTAIN	That came in this morning.

DETECTIVE TOYE	What’s the trail on this?

CAPTAIN	None. They're that good.

DETECTIVE TOYE	The machine didn't pick up anything?

CAPTAIN	That’s your problem now, detective. Let me know what you find.

DETECTIVE TOYE	I’m leading this? 

CAPTAIN	At some point, a man has to lose his virginity. And I do not see you wearing a white collar, so, yes! Your first lead.

DETECTIVE TOYE	Thank you, ma.

KOSSI	The good counterfeit will pass from person to person and stores to stores. They usually don’t get noticed until they reach the bank. Now, the bank has agencies that will compare the notes for tendencies, so they can trace where the fake is coming from. That’s where these guys come in. The first step is usually a shakedown of the usual suspects. My bill was so good, it took them completely off track. Thinking it must be coming from the guys at the top.

DETECTIVE TOYE	Yeah! The regular. Money laundering.

KOSSI	Detective Toye... he's a brilliant, but troubled man.

DETECTIVE TOYE	She gave me the ring back. Now, she’s talking about going to grad school in America. I mean, I make one mistake, one mistake! She calls off the engagement?!

KOSSI	This investigation is not the only headache for Detective Toye... His personal life is also going through some rocks.

KOSSI	Kachi, what is this? Listen! See, Muhtar! Look, all it takes... for this ship to wreck, burn and sink is one single faulty bill. Just one! So if you’re cutting, make sure it's a perfect cut. And if you are pasting, make sure it is a flawless paste. Every strip straight, please! Because, you cannot defend a fake out there... but a perfect copy, you can fight for!

DETECTIVE TOYE	I can’t believe you’re leaving so soon. Leaving me here all alone.

OYIN	Are you sure about that?

DETECTIVE TOYE	So... How's the ticket? 

OYIN	Expensive.

DETECTIVE TOYE	You know, I have a bonus coming in soon. That should be able to take care of that.

OYIN	You don't have to do that.

DETECTIVE TOYE	I know I don’t have to, but I want to. I want it to be my responsibility. Again. See, Oyin it's just...

DETECTIVE TOYE	Whose is this?

OYIN	What is it?

DETECTIVE TOYE	It’s a printed hundred-dollar bill.

OYIN	Really? I don't know. Oh! It’s probably for Kossi. He has an obsession with printing junk. God, I miss him.

KOSSI	Mr. Abu! You are ready for the business, aye?

ENFORCER	Come, let's go! Get up, let's go!

KOSSI	Abu, what is... What is going on?! Abu!

ENFORCER	Let's go!

SHAGARI	How much is this?!

KOSSI	Fifty thousand.

SHAGARI	Where did you get this money?

KOSSI	I don’t know what this has to do with you.

SHAGARI	The last time you came... you changed ten thousand dollars. Now, you've come back. Fifty thousand dollars. What kind of business do you do? Where is your office? I swear to God! We don't like thieves around here!

KOSSI	Who's the thief?

SHAGARI	You talk... or we make you talk. It's up to you.

KOSSI	I will tell you everything that you want to know. I was a house boy in Abuja, for Mustafi.

SHAGARI	The former Governor?

KOSSI	I want five naira off the market price.

SHAGARI	My friend, fifteen naira. This dollar, is old dollar.

KOSSI	No, Shagari, you have not impressed me at all. You have not. I want ten! Plus delivery service. I call you... I tell you where the dollar is, you send the money to me. Deal? 

SHAGARI	Oh my friend, no problem, no problem.

KOSSI	You can change big dollars?

SHAGARI	Come on! Everybody comes to me! One million dollars, two million dollars,no problem, no problem.

KOSSI	I have way more than that.

SHAGARI	My very good friend! God brought you to me!

KOSSI	Shagari!

SHAGARI	My very good friend! My very good friend!

DETECTIVE TOYE	Hello Hammed... I need you to call Johnson, over at immigration. Have him run a flight check on a Kossi. K - O - S - S - I As in Singapore, India. Get everything you can in the last two months. I’m on my way to the office.

FEMI	Uhm... Babe, uhm... It's not what you think. I can explain this. She, uhm... just came around to say hello, and uhm... Okay, please! Just sit down. Hear me out! Just sit for a second, please. Oh fuck!

FEMI	You didn’t even ask any questions. You just walked in and...

SONIA	What the fuck are you talking about, Femi?! I saw you kissing and doing  shit with some fucking whore!

FEMI	Babe... are you going to believe your eyes or what you think you saw or are you going to trust me on this one?

HAMMED	We had a hundred and nine Kossis depart in the last two months.

DETECTIVE TOYE	Hold that thought. Do you think those two came from the same source?

HAMMED	At the least, it can’t be ruled out.

DETECTIVE TOYE	Alright, let’s get a road manifest for the same period.

HAMMED	Okay...

HAMMED	You know, detective... looking at the manifest by road, we could  be talking about over two thousand names.

DETECTIVE TOYE	And your point is?

HAMMED	That’s a whole lot of names.

DETECTIVE TOYE	You have to treat every crime like the crime of the century. You know why? You never know what you’ll find. Frankly, I don’t care if it’s a million names. Go get them.

FEMI	Sonia, please. 

FEMI	You know what... you've got ten seconds to open this door. If you don't, I'll leave and that's it! Will you fucking open this door! Ten! Nine! Eight! Open the door!  Open the fucking door!

IFY	Babe, don't worry about this. He’ll be gone in sixty seconds and we can go to the club and have some fun. Okay?

KACHI	Look at all these girls here, tonight! Kossi, we should live here!

KOSSI	You're gonna get slapped again, yeah?

MUHTAR	It's the pap water, again!

KOSSI	This is because we’re celebrating! Today, our business took a turn for the moon!

KACHI	The moon!

KOSSI	And me...I am ready to enjoy this journey! To a ton of money!

EMMANUEL/KACHI/MUHTAR	To a ton of money!

KACHI	Oh my God!

KOSSI	What, what, what is it?

KOSSI	Mama Bear!

SONIA	Oh, hi!

KOSSI	Hello. How are you?

SONIA	Fine, thank you.

KOSSI	Is that your friend?

SONIA	Yes, this is Ify.

KOSSI	Ify.

KACHI	Kossi! (Laughter)

KOSSI	You know, I was calling your number and you did not pick. So, I thought I had a wrong number.

SONIA	Yeah, maybe.

KOSSI	Ah! See... I'm over there. At the VIP. You wanna come? So we can talk.

SONIA	Can I think about it?

KOSSI	Yeah, sure! Take your time. Twenty seconds... thirty seconds... Any time, just take it, yeah!

SONIA	Okay.

KOSSI	Excuse me.

KOSSI	This is Mama Bear!

KOSSI	So, these are my people. Is everything okay?

SONIA	I never got to thank you for the bag.

KOSSI	Ah, oh yeah? Do you like it?

SONIA	It’s gorgeous! But...I’ll have to give it back.

KOSSI	Oh yeah?!

KOSSI	It was clear that she just  wanted to make him jealous. But, you know what they say... "Opportunity favors the prepared man." I have money now. I mean, that shirt cost me one thousand eight hundred real dollars. That's one hundred dollars more than my perfume. The people at The Polo Avenue promised it will catch me a big fish. Now, Sonia? She is a mermaid!

KOSSI	Are you sure you really  want to return this bag?

SONIA	Uh hm.

KOSSI	But, First thing first... this bag is not empty. 

SONIA	Empty.

KOSSI	Open it.

SONIA	No!

KOSSI	Open this bag, now! Or I’ll be forced to use...  force.

SONIA	What’s stopping you?

KOSSI	Aye! I'm in company of bad boys! Bad boys!

MUHTAR	Last night was the greatest night of my life! And you just missed her.

KOSSI	Is this boy lying or what?

EMMANUEL	Don't ask me...

KOSSI	Who was that?

KACHI	The girl from where we changed the money. I pulled her in!

KOSSI	Are you fucking serious? How the fuck do you  not use your head?

KACHI	Relax, man.

KOSSI	Do you know what you have done? You just brought your shit to the eating table, man.

KACHI	That girl probably can’t find her way anywhere. She can’t even see!

KOSSI	Kachi! So what you're telling me now, is after all this money, you cannot get a fucking hotel? So, I have to stay in my own house worrying about Shagari invading my space with a thousand swordsmen?

KACHI	Kossi.

KOSSI	You tell me!

EMMANUEL	You know what we need?

FEMI	I'm telling you, I trust my instincts.

DETECTIVE TOYE	So you want me to arrest a guy because you think he's a criminal?

FEMI	I know what I saw! Whatever it is, it has to be illegal!

OYIN	What’s going on?

DETECTIVE TOYE	Femi here wants me to arrest a guy because, the guy disrespected him in the club last night.

FEMI	The fuck?! That’s not it.

DETECTIVE TOYE	I'm sorry, I'm wrong... the guy also spent an obscene amount of money, which he thinks is illegal money.

OYIN	Go take a nap, you look a mess. Whatever happened in that club, I'm sure you caused it.

FEMI	I caused it, really? Our houseboy, spending money, buying bottle of champagne at the club! Putting moves on my girlfriend  right in front of my face, and It's my fault?!

OYIN	Wait, Kossi?!

FEMI	Tipping the bouncer a hundred dollars to assault me and carry me out of the club! And that is my fault?!

DETECTIVE TOYE	Wait, hold on... hundred dollar bills? Do you have a description of this bouncer?

ROCKY	How can I help you?

EMMANUEL	We’re working on something right now, and we need protection.

KOSSI	You know... We need you around the clock. Do you have any special skill for that kind of job?

BOUNCER	Hey Rocky! Some people here to see you!

ROCKY	Be right there. Give me one minute.

DETECTIVE TOYE	We’re detectives from the Special financial crimes unit. I'm Toye, and this is my partner, Hammed.

ROCKY	How can I help you?

DETECTIVE TOYE	We are in pursuit of a guy called Kossi. We learned that he was here in your club, last night. We also learned that he gave you a tip. Dollars.

ROCKY	Well, the club is always dark.

HAMMED	I’d like to remind you... lying to an officer is a crime with serious consequence.

ROCKY	Officer, I get tips every night. It’s nothing.

HAMMED	Mind if I have a look at the money?

ROCKY	I exchanged it, already.

HAMMED	Where? Or Do you remember who changed it for you?

ROCKY	Well, the window was crowded, and...

KOSSI	Where did you change the money?

KOSSI	I will triple your salary, if you can work for us starting from now.

ABUBAKAR	Which one, is it dollar or pounds?

DETECTIVE TOYE	Have you seen this guy?

ABUBAKAR	What did he do?

HAMMED	My friend... this guy is flooding the streets with high quality counterfeit. Dollars!	

DETECTIVE TOYE	Look well.

ABUBAKAR	No... no.

DETECTIVE TOYE	Are you sure?

ABUBAKAR	Yes, sure. I've never seen him.

DETECTIVE TOYE	If you ever see him... you give me a call.

KOSSI	Hello, Abubakar! You need what?

ABUBAKAR	One million dollars.

KOSSI	One million dollars? You’re serious? You have the cash?

ABUBAKAR	I have the cash right here with me.

KOSSI	Okay... How about Friday?

ABUBAKAR	Friday is good.

KOSSI	No problem. Thank you, my friend... Thank you, Abubakar.

EMMANUEL/KACHI/MUHTAR	One million dollars!

DETECTIVE TOYE	Baby! Have you heard from your house boy? I’m sorry! I’m sorry!I’m sorry! Have you heard from Kossi? Since he left? Not even one phone call? Fine, if he calls you, you have to call me immediately, okay please? He’s a criminal, in a world of trouble, baby.

OYIN	Kossi, what are you still doing here?

KOSSI	Making money.

OYIN	What do you do?

KOSSI	I make money.

OYIN	I heard you. How?

KOSSI	I print my own money.

OYIN	Kossi!

KOSSI	I know... you know, anyone can be a monster. Except you.

OYIN	Uhm, listen, can I call you back? Not that it’s any of your business, but I’m having dinner with a friend. Okay, bye. Listen, Kossi... that was Toye on the phone, he’s been looking for you everywhere. Kossi, you’re in really big trouble.

KOSSI	Does he know that I'm here?

OYIN	No, of course not. Listen... you need to be really careful. Toye... he has a lot of resources at the agency, and sooner or later, they will find you.

KOSSI	I have to go.

OYIN	Please, call me.

SONIA	I think we actually need to take things slow. This is all too strange for me.	

KOSSI	It wasn’t strange the other night.

SONIA	I had too much champagne!

KOSSI	In wine, there's always the real truth. If you don’t believe me,  then, let us drink again.

KOSSI	Emma, what is it?

EMMANUEL	Don’t you think you should be here?

KOSSI	So I can hold your hand or something?

EMMANUEL	This money is stacking up fast. We need to get everything done by tomorrow.

KOSSI	Are you telling me after all this time, you don’t know what to do?

EMMANUEL	I’m just saying that I don't know what you have going on, that's more important than what we have going on.

KOSSI	Don't worry. I'll see you soon.

KOSSI	Let us go away... to somewhere new. Beautiful. Quiet. I have a deal tomorrow. After then, you won’t have to worry about anything. For sure not money. Mama Bear.

DETECTIVE TOYE	Hey, look!

HAMMED	That's the bastard!

ROCKY	Good morning, boss.

KOSSI	But, you people are aware that we have neighbors everywhere. What is this? The first person step in here, they see all of these things. You're telling me that there's no locker, or safe or something, to put all these things in?

EMMANUEL	Rocky is at the door. Nobody can enter this place. We don’t even talk to anyone here!

KOSSI	Emmanuel... I don't want all these things here.

EMMANUEL	What do you want me to do? You have to check the money before it can enter the safe.  

KOSSI	You're asking me what to do? Emmanuel! What do I want you to do? Oh, okay! How about you take all the money... take everything! Put them together, stack them then put them outside. Now, get a sign post and write, “Money Printing Shop”. How about that? Put these things away!

KOSSI	What is this? What is this? Put this in the locker, locker is over there!

CAPTAIN	Tell me... why am I looking at a report about counterfeit money machine seizures... and I haven't got one single report from you?! Maybe I shouldn’t have assigned you lead on this case. I do not think you’re ready! See me in my office, now!

OYIN	Hey baby. I came here for... two things. 

OYIN	The other day you called me... I lied that I was with a friend, but I was with Kossi. He confessed. 

DETECTIVE TOYE	You love him like a brother. I expected you'd cover up for him.

OYIN	Well, I don't know who this Kossi is. Besides...if WE are going to be spending the rest of our lives together, I...  I need to be sure what side I'm on.

DETECTIVE TOYE	I have an arrest warrant being processed. He’s going down Friday night.

OYIN	Thank God.

OYIN	I... bought my ticket. I leave Friday night.

HAMMED	Hot off the press!

KOSSI	What is going on?

OYIN	Listen, you need to get out of here! Out of Lagos. Out of Nigeria. Please!

KOSSI	What do you mean?

OYIN	Toye has a warrant!


HAMMED	The bastard is going down, tonight!

KOSSI	But you are leaving tonight?

OYIN	Kossi! Are you listening to me, you need to get out!

KOSSI	Where will I go?!

OYIN	I don't know! Listen, I’ve been thinking... do you have enough money to charter a plane?

KOSSI	I think I have enough to even buy a small one.

OYIN	Great! I will send you the details. Kossi! Toye will stop at nothing! 

DETECTIVE TOYE	Assemble the team! I need this wrapped up, quick.

HAMMED	Copy that!

OYIN	Go. Just go. Kossi! You’re fucking Sonia?! I always knew you were baddass!

EMMANUEL	Nine sixty... nine seventy... nine eighty... nine ninety... one million.

KOSSI	All the laptops, ink, paper, clips, everything... Clear this whole house, now.

MUHTAR	Where are we going to?

KOSSI	I don't know.

MR. MARTINS	My dear, the account is now fully operational. There’s about ten thousand dollars in it, right now.

OYIN	I love you, daddy!

MRS. MARTINS	Isn't there something else...

MR. MARTINS	Oh yeah! Oyin...

OYIN	Mom, dad, I love you. I’ll have to call you when I get to the airport. Okay, bye!

MR. MARTINS	Oyin!

OYIN	Kossi! Where have you been?! Larry has been calling me, they’re about to give the plane to someone else!

KOSSI	I just need to make one more stop.

OYIN	Okay, well... there's no time! It's fifteen thousand dollars, or you can pay in naira. Do you have the money?

KOSSI	Yeah, I have the money.

OYIN	Okay, so I need you to go to the airport,  straight away. I've text you the details. He's expecting you.

KOSSI	Okay, but I will have to go home, first.

OYIN	No no no no no... Kossi, listen to me... you cannot go home. Toye is either at your house, or on his way there,  do not go home! Do not fucking go home!

ABUBAKAR	My good friend!

KOSSI	How are you?

ABUBAKAR	Fine! You have the stuff?

KOSSI	Yeah, I have it in the car. Do you have the money?

ABUBAKAR	Hey!

ABUBAKAR	Bring it, quick!

ABUBAKAR	Three hundred and fifty million naira, right inside here.

KOSSI	Give me one second.

KOSSI	One million... dollars. Your request.

ABUBAKAR	Err..that's good. Everything is okay. But, just to be sure... I want to test the dollar. To be sure it's real.

KOSSI	But, I told you the story about the money.

ABUBAKAR	It's not about the story, my friend. This is reality. I'll drop a liquid on it, If the dollar is real... everything goes fine. But, if the dollar is fake... it turns black. Will it turn black? Give me liquid! Will it turn black?

ABUBAKAR	One time, my friend... two times, my friend... will it turn black?

AGENT	Clear!

AGENT 2	Clear!

ABUBAKAR	My good friend. I...  Eh! My friend! 

KOSSI	What?

ABUBAKAR	It turned black! You want to scam me of three hundred and fifty million naira?!	

EMMANUEL	Let me out!

ABUBAKAR	Get him!

EMMANUEL	Kossi!

ABUBAKAR	Put him in the car! Throw him inside!

ABUBAKAR	Indistinct yelling.

HAMMED	What do we do?

SHAGARI	Thief! I told you, I don't like thieves. You've stolen a lot of my money. You can take anything else. my wife, my children, they reduce my money, too. But, when you steal my money?! What I do to you, your hand will never be able to hold money, again.

KACHI	Hello! Fatima... don't do that. I know you’ve been trying to call me. I’ll explain everything, when I see you. Can I see you? Fatima!

FATIMA	I've missed you.

KACHI	I miss you, too! So much that, I want to see you.

FATIMA	Next week. When we get back on land.

KACHI	On land? Where are you?

FATIMA	We're at the beach house, in Satellite.

KACHI	So, you think some ocean will keep me from seeing you?

KOSSI	There were other five house boys there. Only two of us knew where the money room is... we knew the police were coming... So we packed as much as we could, and I came to Lagos.

ABUBAKAR	Hold him, tight!

ABUBAKAR/SHAGARI	Inaudible chatter

SHAGARI	Stop the music! Stop the music!

SHAGARI	Did I hear something?

SHAGARI	Sorry, I must be getting old! You're angry? Don't be angry. Continue!

ROCKY	Shhh! One word and I'll blow your head off! Where are you keeping him? Get in, Get in.

ROCKY	Untie him.

ROCKY	Where's the money?

ABUBAKAR	Tonight there's no sleep. Till the wheels fall off!
