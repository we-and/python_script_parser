THOMAS	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER	It had been a long voyage. At last Vinnie was back in America...

STORYTELLER	Vinnie still had a long way to go before he was home. But as he was setting off from the docks, the Dock Master came to see him. 

STORYTELLER	'We've got some trucks here that you need to take with you to the big city!' 'No problem. You line 'em up and I'll pull 'em!'

STORYTELLER	So the dockyard engines shunted the trucks into a line ready for Vinnie.

STORYTELLER	'Is that all there is!? I'm one of the strongest engines in the world! I could pull that much in my sleep... I could pull that much with a broken wheel! I could pull that much...' 'We get the message!' Said one of little engines.

STORYTELLER	The little engines at the docks didn't like Vinnie's boasting, so they decided to teach him a lesson. 'Don't go yet Vinnie! Seeing as you can take SO many trucks, here's a few more you can take!'

STORYTELLER	So the little engines shunted lots and lots of trucks into a long line. 

STORYTELLER	There were trucks full of rocks and trucks full of timber. There were trucks full of fruit and vegetables... There was even a truck full of cows...

STORYTELLER	'There you go Vinnie! Take that to the big city!' 'Yeah... err, no problem...' 

STORYTELLER	So Vinnie backed up to the long line of trucks... and started to pull...

STORYTELLER	Vinnie puffed as hard as he could. 'Grrrrrr...' he growled as he pulled. 'Pull! Pull! Pulllll!!' Laughed the little engines.
STORYTELLER	Vinnie puffed harder and harder... But he couldn't move the long line of trucks.

STORYTELLER	'Ummm... Maybe I should leave some of these trucks for you guys.... I wouldn't want to be the only engine that was really useful...'  'Okay Vinnie,whatever you say...'
STORYTELLER	So the little engines, shunted some of the trucks away. 'There you go Vinnie!' <giggle>

STORYTELLER	'That's great! I'm glad I could do you all a favour!' The little engines chuckled. They knew that Vinnie felt a bit silly for showing off. 

THOMAS	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
