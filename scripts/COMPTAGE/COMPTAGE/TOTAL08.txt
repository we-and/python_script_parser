LILI		Carolina, what would you do differently if you could go back in time?

CAROLINA		I would have married Arthur when we were young and naive.

CAROLINA	I can still have kids, Arthur.

ARTHUR	You can, but not with me, right?

CAROLINA	You wouldn't do that for me?

ARTHUR	Carol wants to have kids with me. Can you believe it?

MAX	No way!

ARTHUR	Shh. If I find out you told someone I will fire you, hm, dude?

DORINHA	If you really want to have this kid with Arthur, you will.

CAROLINA	What do you mean?

DORINHA	Women always decide.

ARTHUR	This is the deal, Carol won't give up having a kid with me, right? But that can be good.

MAX	So, Jojo's going to get a little brother?

ARTHUR	No, no, of course not. I'm the one who is going to get something out of this. Let her try to have my kid.

MAX	I still don't get it.

ARTHUR	Trying doesn't mean she is going to be sucessful... Meanwhile? Meanwhile, we will have fun.	

MAX	Oh you are an adorable blue-eyed monster.

DORINHA	Sis, women are the ones in power. You have to do the following...

CAROLINA	Hm?

DORINHA		Whenever you are in your most fertile moment in your cycle, you have to seduce that dog. He won't even know what is happening.

CAROLINA	But that's a little dishonest, right?

DORINHA	Oh, no Carolina. No.

CAROLINA	Come on, Dorinha!

DORINHA	No. No guilty conscious here...

CAROLINA	No, I am not going to do that.

DORINHA	… Not right now at this time, Carolina. No!

CAROLINA	(laughs)

DORINHA		Make something up. I don't know. Say it was an accident, get it? It's not going to be a huge sacrifice for Arthur. Quite the opposite, right beautiful? Hm.

CAROLINA		Oh. I've always dreamed of how my son with Arthur would look like.

DORINHA	Or daughter, right? Make your bets.

CAROLINA	(laughs)

DORINHA	No, you only bet with Arthur, I forgot.

CAROLINA	(laughs) Okay, okay! That's it, that's it. Let me get back. I left the magazine for lunch and I never went back. Bye.

DORINHA		You know what I'm going to do? I am going to pray to Saint Cosme and Damiao.

CAROLINA	Oh! Great! No tackyness, please, okaY?

DORINHA		Yeah, do not say that's tacky, okay Carol? I know you, okay?

CAROLINA	(laughs)

DORINHA	After you get pregnant, you'll thank me.

CAROLINA	Okay, okay! Bye.

DORINHA	Hey, hey, hey!

CAROLINA	Thank you (kiss).

DORINHA		That's what sisters are for. Go in peace, my love.

HUGO	Daughter, daughter.

CASSANDRA	Hm?

HUGO	Help me out, give me a lucky number.

CASSANDRA		Oh, dad, I don't know. I'm busy. 34. Okay? My size.

LURDINHA	34, you? Are you sure? (laughs)

CASSANDRA		Hm. Of course, I'm hot right, right? I have a model's body, so sorry.

KATIA		Oh, stop it everything you're doing, Cassandra.

CASSANDRA	Hm?

KATIA	Take a look at this new lipstick color by Bastille.

CASSANDRA	(laughs)

KATIA	Wild Strawberry, my love. Try it on!

CASSANDRA	Put it on me! Put it on me.

LURDINHA	Look, wait a moment. Close your mouth, close your mouth. 

CASSANDRA	(reaction)

KATIA	Let me see?

CASSANDRA	Do you like it?

LURDINHA	Put your hair up.

KATIA	Now you look like a real model.

TODAS	(laughs)

CASSANDRA	Now I already am, right? Tell the truth? Now I need to be TOTAL DREAMER GIRL

LURDINHA	I can't believe it. Are you going to sign up for the contest?

CASSANDRA	I am going to win. (kiss)

LURDINHA	(reaction) I got the goosebumps.

CASSANDRA	(laughs)

KATIA	I think you're right.

CASSANDRA		I just don't like the color. Hm... It doesn't look good. 

KATIA	That's it, my love.

LURDINHA	This one here, Fruit of passion, tastes like passion fruit and it's made for kissing, love!

CASSANDRA	Yay!

LURDINHA	Look, look.

CASSANDRA	Hm...

LURDINHA	Huge mouth.

CASSANDRA	Carol, Carol, wait, Carol!

KATIA	Are you crazy?

CASSANDRA	Cassandra, hm?

FLORISVAL	What is this?

CASSANDRA	Remeber me? You met me at your party. I'm your ex's daughter.

CAROLINA	What happened to your face, girl?

CASSANDRA		What? Ah. (reaction) Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. What is this horror, I look horrible. (reaction)

CAROLINA	You look horrible, excuse me.

CASSANDRA		Carol, wait. Look at me. Don't you think I could be TOTAL DREAMER GIRL

CAROLINA	(reaction)

CASSANDRA	Hm?

CAROLINA	No, now excuse me.

CASSANDRA		Hold on, why not? Wait. Imagine me without having smudged lipstick.

LURDINHA	What? How can this be?

HUGO		Hm. Where is my daughter? She disappeared.

KATIA	I think you shouldn't ask.

LURDINHA	Uh-oh...

KATIA		She left like crazy, almost dropping everything, after she saw the madame arriving in a luxury car.

LURDINHA	I think that's Dorinha's rich sister.

KATIA	Oh.

LURDINHA	It's her. Or is it a rich cousin?

HUGO	Carol.

CASSANDRA	Is the smudge off? Hm? Is this better?

FLORISVAL	Girl, Carolina is in a hurry. Can you excuse us so that she can get in the car?

CASSANDRA	Carol, this is my one in a lifetime chance.

CAROLINA		Can you get me the pepper spray, please, Florisval. 

FLORISVAL	Are you going to keep on top of her?

CASSANDRA	No, wait, calm down.

CAROLINA	(reaction)

CASSANDRA	Wait, Carol. I've dreamed about being a model since I was a kid.

CAROLINA	Ah, here comes the dad.

HUGO	Hi, hi, Carol.

CASSANDRA	Daddy.

HUGO	So good to see you.

CAROLINA	Oh, my gosh.

HUGO		You continue to be... Look, I'm sorry for the confusion I made at that party, okay?

CASSANDRA	Sorry.

CAROLINA		Look, you are forgiven. What I don't forgive you is for keeping me here against my free will.

HUGO	No.

CAROLINA	Please.

CASSANDRA	No, Carol, Carol, Carol!

CAROLINA		My gosh!  We will need to use force, Florisval.

FLORISVAL	Calm down.

CAROLINA	Please.

HUGO	No.

CAROLINA	Can you remove this girl from here?

HUGO	No, no need to Carol.

CASSANDRA	What is this, you guys?

CAROLINA	No...

HUGO	What is this, you guys, só...

CASSANDRA	I come in peace.

CAROLINA	Okay. And I am asking politely...

HUGO	We know each other.

CAROLINA	… for this girl to get our of here.

FLORISVAL	Excuse me.

CASSANDRA	Carol, look, look.

CAROLINA	You two are crazy.

FLORISVAL	Please, get out of the way.

HUGO		Calm down, look, whenever you want to drink ª..

CASSANDRA	Carol.

HUGO	… Coffee at my establishment.

CASSANDRA	I have potential, right.

HUGO	The taste is still the same, remember?

CAROLINA	(reaction)

HUGO	Okay. The same as when we dated.

CASSANDRA	Carol.

HOGO	Remember when we would make out in the good's closet, Carol?

CASSANDRA	(reaction) Cassandra.

CAROLINA	Florisval, for the love of God, go, can't you see that this is being a torture for me?

FLORISVAL	Yes, Miss Carolina, you and him already...

CAROLINA	No! Let's go, you can run them over.

CASSANDRA	Carol, Carol, no. Carol. Good's closet, hm? Wow!

HUGO		Many times. Whenever I win the lottery she will like me again. Yes she will.

CASSANDRA	You dreweled a little, dad.

HUGO	(laughs)

CASSANDRA	Look, the drewel! (laughs)

HUGO	(laughs) Stop.

CASSANDRA	Let's get back to work, handsome.

HUGO	(laughs)

DEBORA	Katio, where is Cassandra and my dad? Did they abandone the bar?

KATIA	What?

DEBORA		Did my dad and Cassandra abandone the bar?

KATIA	Please.

LURDINHA	Oh.
KATIA	They went to talk to Dorinha's rich sister.

LURDINHA	Carol was driving a luxury car.

KATIA	Oh, thanks.

DEBORA	Carolina Castilho?

LURDINHA	Yes, her. Want to  come through?

DEBORA	No. Yeah, did you know that my dad was her boyfriend? They dated.

LURDINHA	(laughs)

KATIA	(laughs)

LURDINHA	Did your dad really date that miss?

DEBORA	Uhum.

LURDINHA	(laughs)

KATIA	Hugo? That dummy?

DEBORA		First of all, my dad isn't a dummy, okay? Secondly, yes, they dated when they were teens. And if you doubt it, you can ask him. Look, it's dripping.

CASSANDRA		Oh Debora, I'm glad you arrived. Can you keep an eye on the bar for me, please? I have something to do.

DEBORA	No, I can't. I'm going to college.

CASSANDRA	So what, monster? My future is at stake. Go take care of the bar.

DEBORA		Your future is at stake, I … Oh... Dad, Dadd. Cassandra is telling me that I need to stay at the bar, but I have to go to college.

HUGO		Oh you can go to the bar. I'll take are of the bar by myself.

DEBORA	Are you sure?

HUGO	Yes.

DEBORA		Okay. But don't let Cassandra take advantage of you, okay? The party was bad enough.

HUGO	Okay/

DEBORA	Kiss. Have a good day at work.

HUGO	Okay. Have a good day at school, okay?

DEBORA	Thank you. I love you.

LURDINHA	(reaction) I'm hot. (laughs)

KATIA	What's going on Hugo? (laughs) I was talking to my friend, and she told me you dated Carolina Castilho, is that true?

LURDINHA	Really? Is that true?

HUGO	She was the love of my life.

LURDINHA	(laughs)

ADELE	Jojo, you already had your fun, right? Now excuse me, because I need to work.

JOJO	Tell me, Adele, isn't it better like this?

AMBAS	(laughs)

ADELE	It's funny. 
	(phone rings) 

ADELE	(reaction) Hello, Cassandra. No, friend, I already told you that there isn't room for her in the agency. No need to come here. No, my boss is in a meeting and I am super busy. Don't insist. What? Where are you?

CASSANDRA	Hi, friend, I'm here!

ADELE	What are you doing here, crazy? 

CASSANDRA		Stop trying to stop me, Adele, I came to talk to you boss personally.

ADELE	Oh, no you won't...

CASSANDRA		After he sees me and appreciates what I have to work with, I doubt that he won't hire me.

ADELE	No, Cassandra, go away.

JOJO	Shorten up your skirt that it might help.

CASSANDRA		Like this? But like this my dress becomes a shirt. (laughs)

ADELE	(reaction)

JOJO	I was being ironic, stupid.

CASSANDRA	Who is this brat?

ADELE	Arthur's daughter.

CASSANDRA		Oh adorable creature. I love this art that you are creating on your computer, hm? Ruin the competition. But horns, mustache. Make it pretty.

ADELE	Arthur?

CASSANDRA	Yes.

ADELE	Coffee? Okay. One minute.

CASSANDRA		Hold on! I'll bring it in. Adele, Leave it to me.

ADELE		No, Cassandra, that's going to look bad on me.

CASSANDRA	Look bad at you, love?

ADELE	Cassandra, you are leaving now.

CASSANDRA	Love a coffee. I've already served a lot of coffee in my lifetime.

ADELE	No, not here...

CASSANDRA	Relax, trust, believe!

ADELE	(reaction)

MAX		So, our scouts sent a few new girls for us to check out. I already selected a few that have a better chance at winning the contest.

ARTHUR	(reaction) Who is the one putting mustaches on the models?

MAX	What a mess! I just asked Adele to Organize this. 

ARTHUR	(reaction) That's okay, Max, that's okay. Either way, this isn't what we are looking for. I've explained this already. They want a natural beauty. Go to the middle of nowhere, get it? That's how they found Gisele Bundchen, wasn't it?

MAX	Yes.

CASSANDRA	Did someone here ask for a coffee?

ARTHUR	Did someone hire new help?

MAX	Adele!

ADELE		No, she insisted in coming over to give you your coffee.

CASSANDRA		I did. We know each other. Arthur, remember me?

ARTHUR	No, should I?

CASSANDRA		We met at the Arts Palace we talked and... (reaction) Ah!

ARTHUR	I can't believe it.

ARTHUR	You burned me, crazy.

CASSANDRA		Sorry, sorry, Arthur. For the love of God? I tripped, I'm  sorry, please?

ARTHUR	Who brought this...

ADELE	She...

ARTHUR	… crazy girl over here?

ADELE	She wants to be a model, but she is already leaving.

MAX	(laughs) Ah, this one here? Okay.

CASSANDRA	Don't get involved, gay, this is in between us.

ARTHUR	Oh.
	
CASSANDRA		Better yet, in between Arthur and Cassandra.

ARTHUR		That's all I needed. Can someone remove this creature from here?

ADELE	She is leaving already.

CASSANDRA	No, no, no.

ADELE	Cassandra, let's leave!

CASSANDRA		No, wait. It's impossible that you don't remember me. I'm Cassandra, Hugo's daughter, hm? Carol's ex-boyfriend.

ARTHUR	You're the crazy guy that gave me the black eye's daughter?

CASSANDRA		So you remember me, right? We talked, you invited me to go back home with you, and everything.

JOJO	You are settling, hm, dad?

ARTHUR		Be quiet, okay? Why don't you just disappear.

CASSANDRA	It's Cassandra.

ARTHUR	(reaction)

CASSANDRA		I just want a chance at being TOTAL DREAMER GIRL, please? Help me.

ARTHUR	It won't be through my agency.

CASSANDRA	But I...

MAX	Darling, the whos is over and I am not hearing applause. Kisses.

ADELE	Cassandra, let's leave.
CASSANDRA	Wait, Arthur.

ADELE	Let's leave.

CASSANDRA	Arthur!

ADELE	Out!

CASSANDRA	Arthur, please.

ADELE	Let's go.

CASSANDRA	Arthur! It's my dream.

MAX	Guys, who brought her?

CASSANDRA	Everyone steps on me, as if I were a can of soda. What have I ever done, Adele? What's wrong with me?

ADELE	I don't even know where to start, friend.

CASSANDRA		But you know how it works, right? Out on the streets.

ADELE		If Arthur finds out that I was responsible for letting you into the agency, I'll get fired.

CASSANDRA		That's okay, (reaction) I'm going, but I am not giving up!

ADELE		Friend, accept it that it'll hurt less. Arthur doesn't want to see you even if you were made out of gold.

ZÉ PEDRO	Some of our suppliers called to find out if the story about Bastille polluting the river is true. If it is, they do not want to be associated with that.

GERMANO	That's all that I needed. One more trouble because of that boy.

LILI	Good afternoon.

ZÉ PEDRO	Hi, Mrs. Lili, how are you?

GERMANO		My love, why are you here. Thank you, Ze Pedro. You can go.

ZÉ PEDRO	You're welcome.

GERMANO	Surprised to see you.

LILI		Why are you surprised? I am still the owner of Bastille.

GERMANO	No, my love, I know. But after Sofia died you haven't been here anymore. That's why. What happened? Is everything okay?
 
LILI	Did you see Fabinho at the protest? They just showed it on TV. It looks like they were aggressive to a policeman, Germano.

GERMANO	Your son, Lili...

LILI	Our son, Germano.

GERMANO	No, he is your son. When he messes up, screws up, he is your son. He is your son because you protect him, you take enable him. That's why he does whatever he wants to do, only what he wants to do. What makes it worst, way worse, is that he keeps denegrating this company's image. His family's company. The suppliers are already complaining. Ze Pedro just told me.
	

LILI	After all, did Bastille pollute the river? Because if Fabinho is right, we should...

GERMANO		(reaction) Fabinho just wants to go against me, Lili, understand? I want him to come here and try to work. Work for real. I already have a bunch of problems, and Fabinho is one more. Gee! If it were Sofia, I am sure that she would be here with me to help.

LILI		Germano, the thing I wanted to most is for Sofia to be here.

GERMANO	(reaction)

LILI		But she died. Fabinho is our only son that is left. What if he goes to jail?

GERMANO		Lili, I think that it's time for Fabinho to own up to what he does, don't you think? If he does go to jail, don't enable him.

MARCÃO	There are thousands of other environmental issues that aren't related to Tamandua River or your dad's company, Fabinho.

FABINHO		I get it. And just because it's my dad's company, it's okay to pollute it?

MARCÃO	No, that's not it.

FABINHO	So what is it, dude?

MARCÃO		You're using our group to get back at your dad. You know what that is right? A bratty kid wanting to prove the love and validation from their dad.

LEILA	Stop it you guys... (voices)

FABINHO	Do you know what this is, Marcao?

LEILA	Oh.

JAMAICA	Stop that, Marcao.

FABINHO		I think that you have a personal issue with me.

JAMAICA	Calm down, Fabinho. What is this, dude?

MARCÃO	What if I do? And if I do?

LEILA	Hold on.

RUIVA	Wait.

FABINHO	You're a jerk.

MARCÃO	What if I am?

RUIVA	Calm down.

LEILA	Stop it, stop it.

MARCÃO		I've made a list with other urgent environmental issues...

JAMAICA	Relax, bro.

MARCÃO	That also need our attention.

FABINHO	Look at this. What is more urgent?

MARCÃO	I want to know who is with me?

LEILA		Do you know what I think? This fight is going to end up tearing our movement apart.

MORENA	You're right.

FABINHO	No, there will be no fights.

MORENA	Leila is right.

FABINHO		Leila, there won't be any fights, okay? Because I am over all of this, okay?

LEILA	Fabinho.

MARCÃO	Ah okay, then leave.

RUIVA E MORENA	Fabinho, Fabinho.

JAMAICA	Come on people...

MARCÃO	We don't need Fabinho.

JAMAICA	… Okay, I'm over it too. I'm out.

MARCÃO	Great, awesome, cool.

JAMAICA	Bye Marcao.

MARCÃO	No one is going to talk to you guys anymore, thanks.

JAMAICA	Hey, bro, wait up. Forget these jerks!

FABINHO	What do you mean forget them, dude.

JAMAICA	We can, I don't know, jump in the Tamandua River as a form of protest. If we get sick, a fungus... we can blame it on your dad.

FABINHO	Wait, dude. I'm not in the mood for jokes. I want to be left alone, okay?

JAMAICA	But that's not a joke.

LEILA	This sucks.

JAMAICA	Come back here, bro.

MARCÃO		Gee, they didn't want to be part of it. They're gone. Why?

CASSANDRA	Katia, Lurdinha, you need to help me.

HUGO		What happened daughter? What did they do to you?

CASSANDRA	Oh, daddy, I need to change my look. People already know me like this and don't like me. Girls, i want to change my hair, my make-up. I just can't turn gold, that might not work.

KATIA	Leave that up to us.

LURDEINHA	No, you can't change, my beauty.

KATIA	Come here, we will take care of you.

LURDINHA	Don't change much.

KATIA	For you, my love.

CASSANDRA	For the love of God.

KATIA	Lurdinha, I can already imagine the scene.

CASSANDRA	(reaction)

KATIA	Red.

CASSANDRA	Red?

KATIA	Think about it.

LURDINHA	No, not red. Platinum blonde.

CASSANDRA	Blonde?

LURDINHA	With a blush so that you look tan.

CASSANDRA	(reaction)

LURDINHA	You'll look rich.

KATIA		Are you crazy? Of course not. Rich is having a lightening poweder, get it? So that you can cause an impact.

LURDINHA		Katia, the girl is already white, you'll become a ghost. No.

CASSANDRA	Guys, either way.

KATIA	Hm? 

CASSANDRA	I don't want to be recognized.

LILI	Can you take me home, please, Silas.

SILAS	Yes, maam.

LILI	What do I do with your brother, Sofia?

SOFIA	What up, mom? What's that look? What is it?

LILI	Fabinho's grades. He should stay back a grade again.

SOFIA	Oh, mom, Fabinho is just a bou. He is lost, but he will find himself.

LILI	You never failed any classes in school.

SOFIA		But we are completely different, aren't we mom? No need to compare. But that doesn't mean I am better than him, that...

LILI	No, but it's always easier with you.

SOFIA	(reaction)

LILI		Oh, No I can already imagine the fight he and dad will have.

SOFIA		Why don't you let him talk to dad? Yeah, Fabinho is super smart, he's going to grow, but he needs to grow by himself, mom or eles he will never grow.

LILI	That means I can't help my son?

SOFIA		You can mom and you should. But do you rememver that song?
Protection doesn't protect.
And too much care makes us regret.

LILI	Really, Sofia? Really?

FABINHO	Olha lá, vem, vem
	Do lado oposto vem
	Sem gosto de viver
	Olha lá
	Que os bravos são escravos
	São e salvos de sofrer
	Olha lá
	Quem acha que perder assim
	Menor na vida
	Olha lá
	Quem sempre quer vitória
	Impede a glória de chorar
	E eu que já não quero mais
	Ser um vencedor
[Song about being slaves of society]

LEILA E FABINHO	Levo a vida devagar
[song about being slaves of society]

LEILA	So that you don't stop. Don't stop, no. I didn't know that you played.

FABINHO	You don't know me.

LEILA		No, but I've been wanting to since today at the movies. You know sometimes I think Marcao is right, Why do you insist in attacking your dad's company? 

FABINHO	(reaction)

LEILA	Why?

FABINHO		Because my dad stands for everything I hate. Isn't it? A businessman that only thinks about profit, right? And if his company is polluting, he doesn't even care.
	
LEILA	But he isn't the only one.

FABINHO	But he is the only one that is my dad...

LEILA	So this is really a personal vengence?

FABINHO	(laughs) When my sister was alive, he and my mom thought she could take over the business one day. Adn I think that with her the company would be very different. Sofia was smart, conscious. She thought about everyone and everyone loved her.

LEILA	Hm. 

FABINHO		(laughs) Sofia is everything I will never be. (laughs - reaction) 

LEILA	I get it, your sister is your problem.

FABINHO	Come here, are you majoring in journalism or psychology?

LEILA	(laughs) I'm majoring in journalism, because I like to understand everyone's side of the story. And I think I'm understanding yours.

FABINHO	(laughs) No, you're not. 

LEILA	Can you at least let me try?

MARCÃO	Oh, you're here? What are you doing with my girlfriend?

FABINHO	What?

LEILA		He isn't doing anything. I came looking for him. I wanted to see how he was doing.

MARCÃO	I wasn't talking to you.

LEILA	What?

MARCÃO		Sorry, but I'm talking to this brat over there. Dude, this isn't possible, first you try to take over my group, now my girl? Is that it?

FABINHO	I don't want anything of yours, idiot.

LEILA	I do not belong to anyone. Okay, I talk to whomever I want and I can do whatever I want.

MARCÃO	Really?

LEILA	Yes.

MARCÃO		What's with you, Leila? Are you hitting on this brat? Let's get out of here.

LEILA	I'm not going anywhere. Actually, if I want to talk to Fabinho, I will. If I want to kiss Fabinho, I will.

FABINHO	Hm?

LEILA	Are you doubting me?

MARCAO	Are you testing me?

LEILA	I am who I am and you aren't the boss of me. (kiss)

FABINHO ELEILA	(Kiss)

LEILA	Get it, Marcao?

FABINHO	Marqunho, if you don't get it we can demonstrate it again, dude.

MARCÃO	Shut up.

FABINHO	Do you want us to?

MARCÃO	Shut up, you son of the bitch.

LEILA	What are you going to do...

MARCÃO	Son of a bitch!

FABINHO	What is it Marcao?

LEILA		… If I was the one who kissed him? Do you still think you're the boss of me?

MARCÃO		You guys deserve each other. You are a brat and you are a cheat, right, Leila? You're out of the group, okay?

LEILA	What does one thing have to do with the next?

MARCÃO	They do.

LEILA		Okay, I'm out. It's over. I'm sorry, I used you. But when this guy says “my” girl, it irriates me. IT makes my blood boil. And I lose it.

FABINHO	Wowza, calm down, calm down, okay?

LEILA	(reaction)

FABINHO		Or you can overreact again. If it's up to me...

LEILA	Don't play.

FABINHO	(laughs)

LEILA	That wasn't cool.

FABINHO	(laughs)

LEILA	So, you get it. Sorry to hear about your father and your sister. I hope you find your way. You seem to be a cool guy. (reaction)

FABINHO	Hopefully our parths cross again.

LEILA		Who knows? If you ever protest over anything eles, let me know. Bye.

FABINHO	Bye. (reaction)

DAYSE	I think my brother is sleeping already.

GILDA	I know, I am just making sure he is okay.

DAYSE	Are you thinking about Eliza, mom?

GILDA		Every day. I need to get some money to send to her.

DAYSE	Ask daddy.

GILDA	Your dad wants to see Eliza dead, my daughter.

DAYSE	She's never coming back?

GILDA		Not too soon. But I am going to find a way to help my daughter, okay? Don't you worry.

DAYSE	Okay.

GILDA	Okay. Go to sleep, go.

DAYSE	Good night.

GILDA	Good night. Give me a kiss? (kiss) Kiss.

DINO	What are you doing there?

GILDA	I was counting the change?

DINO	That's it?

GILDA		And get some money to buy school books for out kids.

DINO	Hm, sure. Get it. This should be enough.

GILDA	It's too little.

DINO		That's what we have. I lost a lot today playing pool. But as soon as I make more, I'll give you more.

GILDA	Okay.

DINO	Wait, woman.

GILDA	What is it?

DINO	Don't leave like that.

GILDA	Why?

DINO	Give me a good luck kiss. Okay, don't look at me like that, okay? (reaction – kiss) did you like it?

GILDA		If you were always like this, it would be really good.

DINO	If I was always like this you would get sick of me. Is it my turn?

PEÇANHA	Yes.

DINO	Let's go.

GILDA	(reaction) It's nothing, I need to find a way to earn more.

ELIZA	It's nothing. I need more than this. Like this I am never going to bring my family over.

JONATAS	But you just started selling flowers, right? Do you think it's easy and quick? 

ELIZA	I can sell flowers all year and it won't be enough.

JONATAS	Hm, calm down! Soon you'll have more experience and you'll build your client base. In the beginning it was hard to make money. But today I take care of my whole family.

ELIZA		You never told me about your family. I sold a flower to your step-dad yesterday, right?

JONATAS	Don't even remind me of that jerk.

ELIZA	(laughs) It's hard to forget, hm? The dude brought the whole bouquet.

JONATAS		But he never had money for child support. I feel bad for my mom, she is always killing herself baking cakes.

ELIZA	She is a baker?

JONATAS	My mom?

ELIZA	Yeah.

JONATAS		Yeah. And there is nothing better than to lick the bowl.

AMBOS	(laughs)

JONATAS	Do you want to try?

ELIZA	What do you mean?

JONATAS	I am going to visit my family tomorrow. You should come to me. I would love to introduce you to everyone.

ELIZA	(laughs)

LILI	Are you okay?

FABINHO	I am, mom. I'm okay.

LILI	You are always in trouble, Fabinho. What if you went to jail again, hm?

FABINHO	Mom, no need to be worried anymore. I'm out.

LILI	Of what?

FABINHO		The group. Everybody only thinks I am there to spite my dad. Now Bastille can pollute as much as they want to. I won't do anything.

LILI		You're going to give up on your cause? Is that it?

FABINHO		(reaction) Mrs. Lili, I'm not understanding. I'm not sure if I understand. I thought you didn't agree with waht I did.

LILI		Not really, of course not, chain youselves, throw paint on your dad, attack a police man? I am completely against that.

FABINHO	Attach a police man.

LILI		But fighting for what you believe in, I am in favor of that. Do you really think that Bastille is polluting the environment?

FABINHO		No mom, I don't think, I know, okay? And there are ways of controlling that, did you know? We did a technical study. You need to install filters, not make too much waste. But that costs money. And that's what dad doesn't want.

LILI		If you come up with a conscious a do-able proposal, I'll support you. And you can go to Bastille and make sure that happens.

FABINHO		(laughs) Okay, I am going to work with my dad, hm. Is that what you are talking about? Mom, he isn't going to let me in the company.

LILI	Son...

FABINHO	(reaction)

LILI		… You aer Bastille's hier, if you want to talk to your dad, that's the way.

JONATAS		My mom doesn't know I work on the streets or that I sleep in an abandoned cinema. She thinks I have a stable job in a law office and that I sleep at a friend's house – Carlitos.

ELIZA	Dude, isn't it hottible lying to your mom?
	
JONATAS		Yes, but if she knew the truth she would be worried and scared.

ELIZA		Okay, so how do we know each other? Hoe did we meet?

JONATAS	You are going to say you are the new receptionist at the office. 

ELIZA	Receptionist?

JONATAS	Yes.

ELIZA	Uhum. And you think it'll work?

JONATAS		Would you rather tell everyone you're my girlfriend?

ELIZA		I'd rather tell the truth, that I am your friend.

JONATAS		Gee, so you're a receptionist friend of mine. Trust me, it'll work. What the eyes don't see the heart won't feel.

ELIZA	Hm.

JONATAS		And I make honest money, it doesn't make a difference.

ELIZA	Yes. Hello. Law Office...

DORINHA	But if I come tomorrow, I won't even arrive.

JOÃO E MARIA	Yeah, auntie.

CAROLINA	Poor things.

MARIA	We promise.

JOÃO	Yes, we promise.

DORINHA	Okay?

CAROLINA		Yeah, cause it would be too much to ask for you guys not to, right?

DORINHA		Aren't you going to an event Carolina? What's the difference of us sleeping here tonight or arriving tomorrow?

CAROLINA		The difference is that I want to come back to my home not hell. (reaction)

DORINHA	Tell me, is Arthur going to this event?

CAROLINA		Of course he is. Everybody in the fashion world will be there. Even my copetitors.

DORINHA		Ah, okay, just say this to Arthur: “Oh, no, my sister is sleeping at home...”

CAROLINA	Ah! You're a clown.

DORINHA		I am going to put it behind that plant that symbolizes fertility.

CAROLINA	Why, Dorinha?

DORINHA	It's a superstition that works quickly.

CAROLINA		Dorinha, don't do this. You know I don't believe in that.

DORINHA		Do your part and I'll do mine, Carol. Aren't you ovulating?

CAROLINA	Hm.

DORINHA	So, it's today.

PIETRO	(laughs)

CAROLINA	She is too ambitious to keep around.

PIETRO	Hm.

CAROLINA	She is my biggest rival, you know that.

PIETRO		Aham.  And I would say that she is your rival in every sense of the word, because it looks like she is having fun. If you know what I mean.

CAROLINA		Yeah, I understand perfectly. That dog can't see a girl using a skirt. Uch.

PIETRO		Ah, my love, why don't you go have fun, too?

CAROLINA	You mean, play dirty?

CAROLINA	This name...

PIETRO	He is the famous unknown photographer, that left a bunch of material on your desk. I never forget a name.

RAFAEL	So you saw my material?

CAROLINA	No, I still haven't seen it, but it looks promising.

RAFAEL	And you still haven't seen anything.

CAROLINA	(laughs)

LORENA	(chit chat)

MARISTELA	Woah, woah, woah.

FLORISVAL	Oh.

MARISTELA		What? Did I hear this correctly? Who here is a bimbo, ugly?

JONATAS	You know that I am the opposite of you step dad, right?

ELIZA	I know. But it isn't easy for me.

JONATAS	That's okay. I'll wait however long it takes.

CAROLINA	(reaction - scream)
