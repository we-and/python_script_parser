GARY	Come on, babe.  It's your birthday.

GARY	She just wants to argue.
	
ANDI	Argue about what?
	
GARY	I'm going to leave her.  I swear I am.  I'm not like those other guys that like to play that game.  You know that.  Don't you believe me?	

ANDI	Yeah, I do.
	
GARY	You just got to give me time.  Hell, who knew meeting at the grocery store would turn into meeting the love of my life? All right.  I wish I could stay and celebrate with you all day.

GARY	I can try and get back tomorrow.
	
ANDI	That's okay.
	
GARY	Come on.  Say you love me.

GARY	You love me.
	
ANDI	You know I do.  I love you.
	
GARY	I love you too.  See you later.  (smooches)
	
ANDI	Get out of here.  (chuckles)
	
GARY	(grunts) (sighs) All right, babe.
	
ANDI	Bye.
	
GARY	Bye.
	
ANDI	(sighs)
		
SINGER	My girls told me that them boys mess around.  My love life is a headache.  We're going out tonight because I'm (indistinct) in love.
		
KAREN	Hello?
	
DANNI	Girl, I am so pissed.
		
KAREN	(on phone) Danni, I--I can't really talk right now.
	
DANNI	No, no, no, no.  Like, this is straight bullshit, you know, like why am I even with him?	

KAREN	What did he do now?
	
DANNI	(on phone) He's liking the hoe's pics on the gram.
	
KAREN	Danni.
	
DANNI	No.  This bitch is from Tuscaloosa.  Who the fuck ever heard of some Tuscaloosa?
	
KAREN	Calm down, Danni.  Okay.  Did you ask him why?
	
DANNI	(on phone) Yeah.  He said he just liked the picture.
	
KAREN	Okay.  Well, maybe he did.
	
DANNI	Then tell me why she just made a post saying getting ready for a road trip.  Hmm?
	
KAREN	Maybe she's going on a road trip.
	
DANNI	Okay.  This country, bitch, don't know nothing about no road trip, Karen, okay?  She's been going to the local Walmart as a road trip.
	
KAREN	Will you stop it, okay?  You judging her, you don't even know her.	

DANNI	All right.  I'll send you her account.  She looks like she belongs behind a mule.  Better yet, she looks like the mule should drive her.	
KAREN	(on phone) Okay.  Enough.  Stop, please.  Stop.
	
NURSE	Ms. Karen Mott?	

KAREN	Yes.  Danni, can I call you back?
	
DANNI	Where you at, girl?
	
KAREN	Doctor's office.
	
DANNI	Okay.  Why are you at the doctor?
	
KAREN	Getting my annual physical, okay?
	
DANNI	Okay.  Well, I only go to the doctor if he's single, so…
	
KAREN	Well, you really should.  Call you back.
		
RAPPER	Down my bae to my boo.
		
SABRINA	Hey.
	
DANNI	(on phone) Hey.  You will not guess what he did now.
	
SABRINA	Girl, I don't have time right now.  I'm at work.
	
DANNI	Then why did you answer the phone?
	
SABRINA	Because I thought you were calling me about Andi's dinner tonight.
	
DANNI	(on phone) What are you talking about?
	
SABRINA	(on phone) Please don't tell me that you forgot it's Andi's birthday.

DANNI	It's her birthday?
	
SABRINA	(on phone) Oh, my God.  Danni, seriously, you're so cloudy sometimes.	

DANNI	No.  Ugh.  I didn't forget.  This--this asshole has me preoccupied.	

SABRINA	All right, girl.  Will you just call me late…
	
DANNI	No, you know what, I haven't even called her and told her, "Happy birthday."  I'ma call her.
	
SABRINA	No, no, no.  No, no.  Danni, do not call her right now, okay?  Because this birthday is a little bit hard for her.	

DANNI	What?  Why and how do you know that and I don't?
	
SABRINA	(on phone) Because we're her friends and we listen when she talks.	

DANNI	Okay.  I pay attention.  It's these edibles, okay?  I just--I need to cut back.
	
SABRINA	I really think you need to stop.
	
DANNI	I just gave up potato chip.  Shit.  One thing at a time.  And why does she hate birthdays so much?
	
SABRINA	Danni.
	
DANNI	Oh.  It's the proposal.  She gave him to her birthday, didn't she?	

SABRINA	Yes.
	
DANNI	And you know what?  Have you thought about this?  It's been six months and we ain't even met him yet.  How come Karen's the only one that met him?
	
SABRINA	Well, you know, she says that he travels a lot.  And honestly, I don't really think that she wants you to meet him yet.
	
DANNI	Why?
	
SABRINA	Girl, you'd be saying whatever is on your damn mind.
	
DANNI	And what's wrong with that?
	
SABRINA	Okay.  Hey, look.  Just do me a favor.  Don't mention it, okay?  Oh, and did you hear that Karen and Zac broke up?	

DANNI	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  And I'ma see his raggedy ass at work and I'ma let him know.  I mean, sleeping with that hoe and I am gonna lay into that ass, you know what I mean?  Like, just…
	
SABRINA	Okay, okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I got you off on a tangent.  We're gonna talk about this later over drinks, okay?  Girl, I got to go.  I'll see you tonight.
	
DANNI	All right.
	
SABRINA	All right.  Bye.
	
MAN	Next.  Next.
	
CALVIN	You can go ahead.
	
MAN	One moment, please.  Now, either he hates me or he's in love with me.
	
SABRINA	Why?
	
MAN	He does that every time.  Passes on me.  I think he's on the down low and he really wants me.
	
SABRINA	Or maybe he just wants me?
	
MAN	Why would he want you?
	
SABRINA	Get out of my face.
	
MAN	I'm just playing.
	
SABRINA	Next.  May I help you?
	
CALVIN	Uh, yes.  I just need to make a deposit.
	
SABRINA	Your deposit slip?
	
CALVIN	Oh.  I'm sorry.  There you go.
	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.  Okay.
	
CALVIN	Look, I'm sorry but I've been coming in here every Friday for the past six weeks.  And this is crazy.  Well, I finally got the courage to say what I'm about to say to you.
	
SABRINA	Are you robbing me?
	
CALVIN	(laughs) Do I look like I would rob you?  No.  I just wanna ask you on a date.
	
SABRINA	Well, Mr. Rodney.
	
CALVIN	So you know my name?
	
SABRINA	Calvin Rodney.
	
CALVIN	Oh, right.  The deposit slip.  (chuckles)
	
SABRINA	I don't mix, you know, business…
	
CALVIN	With pleasure.  I get it.
	
SABRINA	Excuse me?
	
CALVIN	Well, look, I'm a cool dude.  I work hard.  I even own my own real estate company.  And I really like to take you out.	

SABRINA	Well, how do you know I don't have a boyfriend?
	
CALVIN	(laughs) Well, your social media said--look, I know that sounded crazy.  I'm not a stalker.  I'm not a creep.
	
SABRINA	Well, you shouldn't believe everything you see on social media.
	
CALVIN	Well, it was under your stats, so--come on.  What's the harm?  Please.	

SABRINA	(laughs) All right.  Look, I am meeting a few of my girlfriends tonight at 7:00 for drinks.  We should be done around 9:00.  So if you're at Freddy D's around then, I may--I may have a drink with you.
	
CALVIN	Okay.  Sounds good.
	
SABRINA	Okay.
	
CALVIN	I'll see you there.  Freddy D's.
	
SABRINA	Have a nice day.
	
CALVIN	You too.
	
SABRINA	I'm sorry, ma'am.
	
WOMAN	(sighs) Well…
	
MAN	What you doing?
	
SABRINA	Huh?  I'm not doing anything.
	
MAN	Don't you let Ms. Mims catch you looking up (indistinct) accounts.	

SABRINA	I wasn't doing anything like that.
	
MAN	Uh-hmm.  You a manager.  Don't get fired.
	
SABRINA	I'm not doing that.
	
MAN	Good.  Then you don't need to know that I already have and he's paid.  And one day, we'll step in my line and give me all of that.
	
SABRINA	Are we still talking about a deposit?
	
MAN	Oh, yes.  A big one.
	
WOMAN	Excuse me.  Are you going to open this line?
	
MAN	Yeah, sure.  I'm gonna open up right away.  Um…
	
WOMAN	It's about time.
		
DOCTOR	Hello.
	
KAREN	Hi.
	
DOCTOR	How are you?
	
KAREN	Nervous.
	
DOCTOR	Why?
	
KAREN	I need the results for the test.
	
DOCTOR	Oh.  I'm sorry.  I could've called you with the results.  I didn't know you'd be so concerned.  You're negative.	

KAREN	Oh, thank you.  Thank you so much.
	
DOCTOR	Have you been having unprotected sex?
	
KAREN	(sighs) Just with one partner.
	
DOCTOR	Why were you so worried?  Was he unfaithful?
	
KAREN	Can we not do that, Doctor?
	
DOCTOR	Oh.  Okay.  All right.  But let me just say…
	
KAREN	Yeah, I know, I know all that.  Thank you.  Can we do the exam?	

DOCTOR	Of course.   I'm sorry.  Didn't mean to offend you.  Lie back.  Legs up here.
	
KAREN	Okay.  Yup.
	
DOCTOR	You know the drill.
	
KAREN	Unfortunately.  I'm sorry.  It's not you.  It's just I went through a bad breakup.
	
DOCTOR	I really am sorry.
	
KAREN	Thank you.
	
DOCTOR	I know you thought he was the one.  That's so sad.  The last time you were here, you were talking about having a family.
	
KAREN	Okay.  If you don't mind, I don't wanna talk about it.
	
DOCTOR	Okay.
	
KAREN	Yeah.
	
DOCTOR	I'm sorry.  But let me just say, you're 36 now, right?
	
KAREN	Yes.  Uh-hmm.
	
DOCTOR	Well, there are a lot of alternatives out here.  If you're unlucky in love and you still want a family, we could freeze your eggs but you have to know after 35, all pregnancies are geriatric.  Higher risk.
	
KAREN	Is something going on down there I need to know about?
	
DOCTOR	No.  Everything looks great here.
	
KAREN	Oh.  Okay.  Well then, can we stop talking about the gloom and doom of my future and getting older?
	
DOCTOR	Okay.  I'm sorry.
	
KAREN	Thank you.
	
DOCTOR	Shall we talk mammograms?  You know, at a certain age…
	
KAREN	(scoffs) (sighs)
		
ANDI	Good morning.
	
AARON	Come.
	
ANDI	Yes?
	
AARON	He's here.  Mr. Green and his lawyer.
	
ANDI	But we're not doing court for another two hours.
	
AARON	I know.  So why do you think he's here?
	
ANDI	I think he wants to talk settlement.
	
AARON	I think he wants to avoid court.  I know this is only the second case that you've done for our firm but if you nail this for Helen, she have a lot of friends looking for a great divorce attorney.
	
ANDI	I am aware.
	
AARON	A lot of money will flood this place.
	
ANDI	(chuckles) I am aware of that as well.
	
AARON	Did you know we took a huge gamble on you?
	
ANDI	Yes, you have made that very clear, sir.
	
AARON	And I took a lot of heat from the other partners?
	
ANDI	Well, I'm glad that I can finally show what I can bring to the table.	

AARON	Do you need me in the room?
	
ANDI	No.  I can handle it.
	
AARON	This is big.
	
ANDI	I got this.  (clears throat) Hi.
		
HELEN	We're supposed to be in court.  Why am I here?
	
ANDI	Well, apparently, my boss called and asked you to come in here first.
	
HELEN	Is there a problem?
	
ANDI	No.  No, this is very good.
	
HELEN	Will he give me what I'm asking for?
	
ANDI	We'll see.
	
HELEN	Listen, if he gives me five million and a house, it's…
	
ANDI	Hey.  We'll see.  Coffee?
	
HELEN	Aren't they waiting?
	
ANDI	(chuckles) Yes.  Which is even more of a reason for us to take our time.  They came to us, remember?  Cream?  Sugar?
	
HELEN	Yes.
		
SYLVIA	Sir?  Sir.
	
JACKSON	I am not gonna pay $45 for this bag, all right?
	
SYLVIA	Sir…
	
JACKSON	That is crazy.
	
SYLVIA	Sir, it needs to fit in the bin.
	
JACKSON	And it does.
	
SYLVIA	Sir, you're clearly stuffing it in there.
	
DANNI	All right.  It's okay.  What seems to be the problem?
	
JACKSON	I've been flying this airline for years, okay?  I am not gonna pay for it.
	
DANNI	All right, Mr. Jackson.  We will not be charging you any extra today.  You go right ahead.  You have a good flight, okay?
	
JACKSON	Thank you.
	
DANNI	Sorry for the inconvenience.
	
JACKSON	Thank you.  Someone here knows how to treat a customer.
	
DANNI	Yes.  You know, my name is Daniella King.  If you wanna send a comment to corporate, you go right ahead with this card, okay?	
JACKSON	All right.
	
DANNI	Thank you for flying Higher Airlines.
	
JACKSON	Thank you.
	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.
	
SYLVIA	Thanks.
	
DANNI	Girl, stop arguing with these assholes.  This ain't your money.  Give them their shit.
		
ZAC	Don't cross in front the cart.  Don't cross in front the cart.  Don't cross in front the--damn.  What is wrong with you?
	
DANNI	Your ass is gonna talk to me.
	
ZAC	I got to get these people to the plane.
	
DANNI	I hooked you up with my friend and now, you wanna go and be with this whore.	

ZAC	I don't--I was…
	
DANNI	You're a trifling ass.
	
ZAC	Oh, wow.
	
DANNI	Bitch ass punk of a man who ain't even got the damn balls to be a man.  That is my friend.	

ZAC	Are you done?
	
DANNI	No.  Wait until I see her at work again.  You let me see that hoe.
	
ZAC	Can I go now?
	
DANNI	Oh.  And tell your boy, Mr. Jerome, that if he keeps liking these hoe's pics, I'm--I'm gonna light his ass up.
	
ZAC	You know you're not dating, right?
	
DANNI	I don't know what you call it, Zac.  But we are, okay?  We're in a situationship of sorts, what have you.
	
ZAC	Can I go?
	
MAN	We really need to get to our plane.
	
WOMAN	(gasps) No.  I wanna hear about his bitch ass.
	
ZAC	I should hit you with this cart right now.  Okay.  I need this job.  Move out of my way, Danni.
	
DANNI	You better hear me.
	
ZAC	I got you.  I'm sorry about that, guys.  We just--no, it's routine.  We do that some…
	
MAN	Just get us to our plane.
	
ZAC	Excuse me.  Cart coming through.  You see the cart.  You see the cart.  Everybody see the cart.  It's a nice suit, brother.
		
ANDI	Well, this is our offer.
	
MI. LAWYER	Are you insane?  Just…
	
MICHAEL	You have lost your mind.
	
MI.LAWYER	Michael.
	
MICHAEL	Look, she's trying to take me for everything I got.
	
MI.LAWYER	I got it.  I got it.
	
ANDI	We will take 25 million.
	
MI.LAWYER	Offering four.	

ANDI	Okay.  Well then, we'll see you in court in a little bit.
	
MI.LAWYER	Young lady, do you know how settlements work?  Where's Grant or Bellamy?
	
ANDI	I am her attorney and I am handling this.  Now, you deal with me now or you deal with me in court.  Let's not waste each other's time.  We both know why you don't want to go to court.  It's because I subpoenaed your tax records and I found some things that I'm pretty sure you've been hiding from Ms. Green.
	
MI.LAWYER	Come on, Michael.  We won't be blackmailed.  I'll report you to the Bar.
	
ANDI	See you in court.
		
HELEN	I would have taken the four.
	
ANDI	I promise you, I can get you more than that.  Do you know what he's been up to?	

HELEN	I don't.
	
ANDI	Do you see that body language?  That's them giving in.  Welcome back.
	
MI.LAWYER	(clears throat) Twenty million, our final offer.
	
ANDI	My client will take your offer and the house.
	
MICHAEL	She wants the house too?
	
MI.LAWYER	Michael.
	
MICHAEL	Fine.  I hate you.  I hope you die on every dime.
	
HELEN	Oh, my heavens.
	
ANDI	Congratulations.  (laughing)
	
HELEN	(gasps) Oh, my heavens.  Oh, my God.  I have a friend who wants to file for a divorce.  Just wait until I tell them about you.
	
ANDI	Please do.
	
HELEN	This is great.
		
KAREN	You know, I was really hoping not to have to spend more money to change locks, but go ahead.  Make me waste more money.	

ZAC	How many ways can I say I'm sorry?
	
KAREN	Let's see.  There's the way you said you're sorry and got me flowers.  Then the next time, you did it again. Then there's a way that you said you're sorry and brought home some shit that I had to be on antibiotics to get rid of.
	
ZAC	Okay.  You think I do this shit on purpose?
	
KAREN	Does your dick have a mind of its own?
	
ZAC	I don't know why I do this.  She didn't even mean…
	
KAREN	Mean nothing, to you?  Yeah, I heard that shit again and again way back.
	
ZAC	You know I love you, Karen.
	
KAREN	What is love, Zac?
	
ZAC	Baby…
	
KAREN	No.  Call that bitch baby.  What is love to you, Zac?  Hmm?
	
ZAC	It's the way I feel about you.  It is.
	
KAREN	You--you better have all your shit gone or I'ma have it gone for you by the time I get home.  Do you understand me?
	
ZAC	Karen…
	
KAREN	What?
	
ZAC	Nothing.  Karen.  Karen.
	
	
	
SINGER	I don't know what you are for me.
			
SABRINA	You know I got you, though.
	
DANNI	Okay.  I got to (indistinct) sometimes.
	
KAREN	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I'm sorry I'm late.
	
SABRINA	Hey, lady.
	
DANNI	Break up will make you pedal on your highest heels.
	
KAREN	Oh, God.  Okay.
	
SABRINA	Danni.
	
DANNI	But she does.  Anyway, girl.  I cussed his ass out for you at work today.	

KAREN	Hmm.
	
DANNI	You know, I'm sorry that men are dumb.
	
SABRINA	Can we just not--can we not?
	
KAREN	Thank you.
	
DANNI	Fine.  Where's Andi?
	
KAREN	She just texted me.  She's parking.
	
DANNI	Okay.
	
SABRINA	Remember, don't mention her birthday, okay?  Promise me.
	
DANNI	I'm not your child.
	
SABRINA	Thank God.
	
DANNI	Oh.
	
SABRINA	Ooh.
	
KAREN	What's up, girl?
	
DANNI	Hello (indistinct)
	
ANDI	Hello.
	
DANNI	Happy birthday, bitch.
	
SABRINA	Danni, I just said not to mention her (indistinct)
		
DANNI	Oh, 'cause you're the boss?  Anyway, we are all having birthdays at least once a year.
	
KAREN	Oh, my God.
	
DANNI	Okay?  So chill.
	
ANDI	You know what?  That's fine.  Because today is a great day.
	
DANNI	Oh.  Did he propose?  Girl, let me see the ring.
	
ANDI	He did not propose, Danni.  But thanks for asking and making me feel uncomfortable.
	
DANNI	Who's uncomfortable?
	
SABRINA	Hey, I think we're just so excited because we thought he was gonna propose today, you know, on your birthday.
	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.
	
DANNI	But, you know, we still ain't met him yet or given you our approval, or disapproval so…
	
ANDI	Look, my happiness is not based on him today.  Is that okay with everybody?
	
DANNI	You really okay with your birthday this year?
	
ANDI	Why not?  I just got the largest divorce settlement my firm has ever seen.
	
SABRINA	What?  I can't believe this.
		
KAREN	Gonna get that.
	
ANDI	Yes.  (laughs)
	
SABRINA	That's amazing.  Congratulations.
	
ANDI	Thank you.  You know, you guys have no idea.
	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.
	
ANDI	Seriously.
	
SABRINA	Oh, well, I mean, I understand.  Some of these white people don't want you in their space.  It's…
	
ANDI	To be fair, one of them did.
	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.
	
ANDI	But I was so happy to rub it in their faces because I know they only hired me to get the black athletes who were getting divorce.
	
SABRINA	Yeah.
	
DANNI	Yeah, girl.
	
ANDI	But this settlement was the CEO of a major company.
	
SABRINA	Hmm.
	
ANDI	I was like, "Pick up your faces, clear people."
	
KAREN	Yes.
	
ANDI	I want some champagne.
	
KAREN	You deserve it.
	
SABRINA	Yes.  We do.
	
ANDI	Oh, hi.  Come on up.
	
DANNI	Hi.  Let me have some patron shots, ace of spades, and I'll have peach CIROC.
	
KAREN	Wait, didn't you just say you ain't had no money?
	
ANDI	Definitely.
	
DANNI	See, that's the shit.
	
SABRINA	It's okay.  It's okay.
	
ANDI	Okay.
	
SABRINA	It's all right.  All right.  I got it.  I got it.
	
ANDI	Yes.
	
SABRINA	I got it.  I got it.
	
KAREN	Yes, you do.
	
ANDI	Thank you, Sabrina.
	
SABRINA	But I wanna get back to the topic at hand.
	
ANDI	Hmm?
	
SABRINA	When is he gonna propose?
	
ANDI	Oh, that's the topic at hand?
	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.
	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.
	
ANDI	We are gonna take our time because we have plenty of time, right?	

DANNI	Uh-hmm.  Hmm.  Uh-hmm.
	
ANDI	Right?
	
KAREN	Okay.
	
DANNI	Well, you know, I like him for you, okay?  He sounds perfect even though he's a ghost.
	
KAREN	My gosh.
	
DANNI	How long has it been that we haven't seen this man, okay?
	
SABRINA	Six months but who's counting?
	
ANDI	How do you know that?
	
KAREN	We need to get them shots now.
	
ANDI	Oh, speaking of shots, how did everything go with the doctor?
	
KAREN	That depressed the shit out of me.
	
SABRINA	Oh.
	
KAREN	Did you know that if any of us get pregnant, it's considered geriatric.
	
DANNI	(hollers) What?
	
KAREN	Exactly.
	
DANNI	I don't have a geriatric uterus.
	
KAREN	We not even 40 yet.
	
ANDI	It's just the way it is.
	
KAREN	But she was talking about freezing eggs and all this stuff…
	
SABRINA	Oh.
	
KAREN	…that I just really, really, really don't wanna think about.
	
SABRINA	I don't wanna think about that either.  Can we get back to our happy place with Andi?
	
ANDI	Yes.  And I am going to break things off with Gary.
	
SABRINA	What?
	
DANNI	Is it because he didn't propose?
	
SABRINA	Is that it?
	
ANDI	I don't think he's the one.
	
DANNI	Hold the hell on.  I'm gonna need some clarification.
	
SABRINA	Danni, I got this one.
	
DANNI	Okay.
	
SABRINA	Because I need to--hmm.  You--you find a single…
	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.
	
KAREN	Okay.
	
SABRINA	…hot…
	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.
	
SABRINA	He's so hot.
	
ANDI	Right.  Okay.
	
DANNI	And he's…
	
SABRINA	Man with money.  I mean, he's stacked.  And you wanna dump him?  Explain it.	

DANNI	Is he down low?
	
ANDI	No.
	
DANNI	Okay.  Crooked dick.
	
SABRINA	Wait.  What do you mean, crooked dick?
	
DANNI	Captain Hook.
	
SABRINA	Ah.
	
DANNI	Just like a hook.
	
SABRINA	That feels good, huh?
	
DANNI	What?  Okay.  Turtleneck?
	
ANDI	No.  What is that?
	
DANNI	Uncircumcised.
	
SABRINA	Oh.
	
ANDI	Oh, my gosh.
	
KAREN	Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  You know what?
	
ANDI	Yeah.
	
KAREN	Some of us just aren't compatible.
	
ANDI	Thank you.
	
KAREN	That's it.
	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.  You're full of it, Karen.
	
SABRINA	You are so smart, Karen.
	
ANDI	No, it's true.
	
DANNI	No.  Because I'd be compatible with a damn rat if he paid my bills.
	
KAREN	Okay.
	
SABRINA	Shh.  Don't say that so loud.  That's sad.
	
KAREN	That's nasty.
	
ANDI	And gross.
	
DANNI	Well, I'm talking real, right?
	
SABRINA	Okay.  Shh.  I just wanna know.
	
KAREN	Yes.
	
SABRINA	For real, though.  Why are you breaking it off with him?
	
KAREN	Okay.  Can we just--can we eat and just not talk about men?
	
ANDI	Thank you.
	
DANNI	Please.
	
ANDI	She understands.
	
KAREN	One night, tonight?
	
DANNI	But we always talk about men.
	
ANDI	Not my man.  Let's just talk about your--oh, that's right.  You guys don't have any men.  No wonder.  (laughs)
	
KAREN	Hey.
	
DANNI	Keep it up, you ain't gonna have no more birthdays.
	
KAREN	Waitress, the drinks.
	
ANDI	Mind your business?
		
KAREN	Cheers.
	
ANDI	Third time…
	
KAREN	Cheers.  Cheers.  Cheers.
		
ANDI	…is a charm.
	
KAREN	Is it?
	
ANDI	Hmm.
	
SABRINA	Hmm.
	
ANDI	Wait.  You didn't look me in my eyes.
	
SABRINA	You're gonna have bad sex.
	
ANDI	Bad sex for you.
		
DANNI	Don't wish that evil on me (indistinct) don't wish that evil on me.
	
ANDI	Wait.  Are you having sex right now?
	
KAREN	Do you?  Aren't you celibate?
	
DANNI	Okay.
	
ANDI	(laughs) Involuntary…
	
DANNI	What time is it?
	
ANDI	(laughs)
	
SABRINA	9:00.
	
ANDI	What?
	
DANNI	Wait.  How do you know that?  You didn't even look at your watch.
	
SABRINA	Because my date just walked in.
	
ANDI	(gasps)
	
KAREN	Date?  What date?
	
SABRINA	Oh, no.  No, guys.  Don't make it obvious.
	
DANNI	Oh, my gosh.
	
ANDI	He is fine.
	
SABRINA	All right.  Look, look, look, I met him at the bank.  He asked me out.  But my friend, he thinks he's kind on the down low and I'm not quite sure, so that's why I didn't tell you all about it.  But I want you to give me an on the spot appraisal.
	
KAREN	Nice.  It's okay.  We don't…
	
DANNI	Shh, shh, shh, shh.
	
CALVIN	Hi.
	
KAREN	Hi.
	
ANDI	Hi.
	
SABRINA	Hi.
	
KAREN	How are you doing?
	
SABRINA	You're on time.
	
CALVIN	Yeah.
	
SABRINA	These are my girlfriends.  This is Karen.
	
KAREN	Hey.  How you doing?
	
SABRINA	Andi.
	
ANDI	Hi.
	
SABRINA	This is Danni.
	
DANNI	Do you like dick?
	
ANDI	Danni.
	
DANNI	What?  Do you?
	
SABRINA	Excuse her.
	
CALVIN	I could chill at the bar if I need to come back, you know.  That's no problem.
	
SABRINA	No.  No.  No, no, no.  It's fine.  It's fine because you know what?  This is over.
	
CALVIN	Well, it was nice meeting you ladies.
	
KAREN	You, too.  Bye.
	
ANDI	Same here.
	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.  Goodness gracious.  You see his chest hair?
	
ANDI	I did.  Excuse me.  Could you stop?
	
KAREN	Yeah.
	
DANNI	Listen, all I know is they're doing the room full of (indistinct)
	
ANDI	Okay.  See, I can't.
	
KAREN	It's true though.  Yeah, it's true.
	
ANDI	Are you serious?
	
DANNI	All right.  I'm going to smoke.
	
ANDI	No.
	
DANNI	Okay.
	
ANDI	Thank you.
	
DANNI	Ciao ciao.
	
KAREN	Why are we friends with her again?
	
ANDI	Because she's harmless and she's funny as hell.
	
KAREN	Hmm.  If you say so.
	
ANDI	You know you love her.
	
KAREN	Hmm.
	
ANDI	Stop it.  And thank you for not telling the girls that Gary was married.
	
KAREN	Girl, you know I'm not gonna say a word.  Come on now.
	
ANDI	I'm gonna end it.  I am.  (chuckles) This cannot go on.  I mean, he comes over in the morning and we have sex and then he goes to the gym.  It's just like--I feel like a whore, you know.  And on top of that, hearing all these women talk about what their men have done and going to divorce court, I just know how ugly this could get.
	
KAREN	Are you strong enough?
	
ANDI	Are you?
	
KAREN	Look, I know what it's like to be cheated on and so do you.  That's why we both vow we would never do it.
	
ANDI	He said he's leaving her.
	
KAREN	(scoffs) You gave him four months to at least move out.  That time has come and gone, Andi, and he's still there.
	
ANDI	I know.  When I am with him, it just feels so right.  He makes me feel like he's the one.  And like I'm the only one.
	
KAREN	At 4:00 AM.  Look, hey, I get it.  But you and I both deserve better, okay?  So I'm not gonna give in to Zac, and you don't give in to Gary, deal?	

ANDI	Deal.
	
KAREN	That was quick.  I didn't expect that.  You're agreeing real fast.
	
ANDI	(chuckles) I'm ready.
	
KAREN	I hope so.
	
ANDI	Me, too.
	
KAREN	Can we drink some more of this?
	
ANDI	Another shot?  (laughs) You know, I am drunk.
	
KAREN	You are but we got a whole another bottle, girl.
	
ANDI	I know.
	
GARY	Hey.
	
ANDI	What are you doing here?
	
GARY	I wanted to surprise you.
	
DANNI	Excuse me, bro.  She'll be right back.
	
SABRINA	What?  (gasps) There, he's fine.
	
DANNI	Yup.  Hey.
	
ANDI	Oh, no.  Oh, no.
	
SABRINA	Damn, he's fine.
	
ANDI	Oh, no.  Oh, no.
	
DANNI	Who you?
	
SABRINA	Hi.
	
GARY	Hi.
	
ANDI	Danni.
	
SABRINA	Hi.
	
DANNI	You're Gary.
	
ANDI	Danni.
	
DANNI	What?  We've been wanting to meet this mystery man for six months.
	
ANDI	Okay.  Danni.
	
DANNI	Damn, you're fine, Gary.  How are you?
	
ANDI	He…
	
SABRINA	He's fine.
	
ANDI	Yeah.  I know.  He travels a lot, that's why you don't see him.
	
GARY	Yes.  And I hate to steal this amazing woman from you all.
	
SABRINA	Oh, no, we're done, we're done.  You can have her.
	
ANDI	No.  No.  No.  Shh.
	
SABRINA	We're done.
	
ANDI	Yeah.
	
SABRINA	You can take her.
	
ANDI	Are you ready to go?
	
GARY	Yeah.
	
ANDI	We're gonna leave.  We're gonna leave.  Yes.  Okay.
	
GARY	Ladies, it's a pleasure to finally meet you all.
	
KAREN	Don't forget your purse.
	
ANDI	Yeah, I won't.  Okay.  Yup.  Let's go.
	
SABRINA	So much pleasure.
	
ANDI	Yeah.  Yeah.
	
DANNI	Don't be a stranger.
	
ANDI	Thank you.
	
GARY	Bye, ladies.
	
DANNI	(indistinct) that ass up.
	
ANDI	Bye.
	
SABRINA	Have a lot of pleasure.
	
DANNI	What?
	
KAREN	Why would you say that in public?  Why would you…
	
SABRINA	I don't know.
	
DANNI	That's why you can't drink.  I should drink yours.
	
SABRINA	I should get back to my date.  I'll see you all later.
	
DANNI	Wait, wait.  I don't--I don't wanna leave.
	
KAREN	No.  No.  No.  I'm--I'm gonna go.
	
DANNI	Let's go to Ladies' Night.
	
KAREN	I'm gonna go.
	
DANNI	Let's go to…
	
KAREN	I don't feel like dealing with strippers and I know you ain't got no money.
	
DANNI	That's why I want you to go…(snickers) duh.
	
KAREN	Good night, Danni.
	
SABRINA	(chuckles)
	
CALVIN	(chuckles)
	
SABRINA	Sorry.
	
CALVIN	Your friends, they're over the top.
	
SABRINA	It's just the one, you know.  Sorry about that.
	
CALVIN	Hmm, what?  Her asking me if I was gay?
	
SABRINA	Well, do--yeah.  You don't have to repeat it.
	
CALVIN	Well, she must have got it from you.
	
SABRINA	Sorry.  I'm sorry.
	
CALVIN	Sabrina, what would you like to know?  Look, I like to think of myself as honest and straight up, so just tell me.  What do you wanna know?
	
SABRINA	(chuckles) Honest?
	
CALVIN	Yeah.
	
SABRINA	Okay.  Maybe it's a little silly but you are really groomed.  And my friend at the bank thought you were flirting with him.
	
CALVIN	(laughs) Wow.  Well, let me put your mind at ease.  I'm not gay, Sabrina.  I'm not down low, I'm not bisexual.  I love women, just women.  Especially women that are, I don't know, five-seven, small waist, and know how to wear the hell out of a blue dress.	

SABRINA	It's black.
	
CALVIN	(chuckles) Are you serious?  That dress is clearly blue.  These eyes don't miss nothing.
	
SABRINA	No.  This dress is black.
	
CALVIN	Oh, excuse me.  Can you please tell me what color is this beautiful woman's dress, please?	

WAITRESS	Blue.
	
CALVIN	Thank you.  Oh, and can we get another round?
	
WAITRESS	Sure.
	
CALVIN	Appreciate it.
	
SABRINA	I don't care what she says.  My dress is black.
	
CALVIN	Well, perhaps I'll get a chance to check the tag with it.  Come on.  I was kidding.	

SABRINA	And if you came here because you think I'm gonna sleep with you, you can leave.	

CALVIN	(chuckles) Now do you think that I would come into the bank all those weeks trying to get your attention just to be able to sleep with you?
	
SABRINA	I hope not.
	
CALVIN	Give yourself more credit than that.
	
SABRINA	I give myself all the credit.  I'm just not giving you anything.
	
CALVIN	Oh, ouch.  Okay.  All right.  But you are a beautiful woman though.
	
SABRINA	Thank you.
	
CALVIN	So what's wrong with you?  Why ain't you got no man?
	
SABRINA	Wow, that is such an aggravating question.
	
CALVIN	Now why is that?
	
SABRINA	Because, I mean, people like you ask somebody why they're single because they think something's wrong with them.  What if I just didn't find the right guy yet?
	
CALVIN	Well, here's to the end of it.
	
	
	
ZAC	You really changed the locks?
	
KAREN	My brother did as soon as you left.  Just get your shit and go.
	
ZAC	Three years, you're gonna throw all away just like that?
	
KAREN	No.  You threw it away when you've dealt with that Insta hoe.
	
ZAC	I was…
	
KAREN	What, what you was, huh?
	
ZAC	Can we at least talk about this?
	
KAREN	Can you just go?
	
ZAC	You act like this ain't my place, too, Karen.
	
KAREN	What the hell are you talking about?
	
ZAC	Oh, so you're gonna act like I ain't helping you with the deposit?
	
KAREN	And you ain't spent a dime on rent since, so I damn sure think we are even, Zac.	

ZAC	All right.  But you asked me what love is, right?  I don't know.  You know where I come from.  I've just been trying to figure this all out.  I've never had a woman like you before.
	
KAREN	And you never will again.
	
ZAC	(sobbing) I know, so damn stupid.  I don't know how I keep doing this to us.  I can't believe I keep doing this to us.  Baby, help me, please.
	
KAREN	Leave.
	
ZAC	Baby, help me get better.  If you leave me now, I'd be lost forever.  When I met you, you saved me.  You did that.
	
KAREN	Zac.
	
ZAC	Babe…
	
KAREN	Zac, stop, no.  I can't save you if you are so hell-bent on drowning.	

ZAC	Baby, I'll get help.  I swear I'll get help, I'll do whatever I could do, just--it's not right, what I'm doing to you is not.  I don't know what else to do.  I need you, babe.  Please.  Please.  (sobbing)
			
GARY	Okay.  (groans)
		
ANDI	(laughs) No.  (scoffs) Shut up.  Yeah.  I missed you.
	
GARY	Uh-hmm.
		
ANDI	(giggles) Round two?  (smooching)
	
GARY	I got to go.
	
ANDI	Well, I thought you were spending the night tonight.
	
GARY	I was going to but she just texted me.  My son has a fever.  So sorry.
	
ANDI	Gary, I have to say this.  I…
	
GARY	Babe…
	
ANDI	If you can't keep…
		
GARY	…I can't fight with you and my wife, too.
	
ANDI	I'm not trying to fight with you.  I'm just trying to have a conversation about…	

GARY	I love you.  And you have been so cool and so great through all of this.  Please don't give up on me now.  Just give me a few more months.
	
ANDI	You said that three months ago.
	
GARY	Look at me, I love you.  I love you.  And I've always been honest with you.  She and I are at the end.  We are.  (smooches) I got to go.		
KAREN	(moaning) Zac, I said you could stay on the sofa.
	
ZAC	I know.  I just feel so bad everything I did to us.
	
KAREN	Okay.  But the sofa.
	
ZAC	Yeah.  But can I just hug you?  Like, I feel so lonely out there.
	
KAREN	No, Zac, the sofa.  What are you doing?
	
ZAC	What you using that thing for?
	
KAREN	Zac, stop.
	
ZAC	I hear you using that thing.
	
KAREN	Stop, Zac.  Stop, Zac.  (giggles) Let go.  Zac.  Zac.  (moaning)
		
AARON	You did it.
	
ANDI	Thank you.
	
AARON	So word got around, apparently (indistinct) has a friend who's also married to a CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  She's waiting to see you in your office.
	
ANDI	Hi.
	
JASMIN	Hi.
	
ANDI	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
	
JASMIN	Oh, no worries.
	
ANDI	(chuckles) I'm Andrea Barnes but everyone calls me Andi.
	
JASMIN	Jasmin Borders.
	
ANDI	And you're friends with Helen?
	
JASMIN	Yes.  You got a really great result for her.
	
ANDI	Yes, we did.  We worked really hard at it.
	
JASMIN	Uh-hmm.  Yes.  I'm sure.  (chuckles) (clears throat)
	
ANDI	First, I'd like to say, I hate that we're here to talk about divorce.
	
JASMIN	Yeah.
	
ANDI	I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
	
JASMIN	Well, unfortunately, it's inevitable for some.
	
ANDI	Yes, it is.
	
JASMIN	So hence, I'm here.
	
ANDI	And hence, I have a job to do.
	
JASMIN	So, where do we start?
	
ANDI	Let's start with your husband's name.
	
JASMIN	(sighs) Gary, Gary Marshall Borders.
		
WOMAN	Next on Sistas.
	
JASMIN	I know he's cheating with someone and I'm sick of it.
	
ANDI	Do you have proof?
	
SABRINA	We were sitting there.
	
ANDI	Uh-hmm.
	
SABRINA	And then this guy comes in.
	
CALVIN	Oh, my God, Lance?  Look at you.  Oh.
	
ANDI	Oh.
	
KAREN	Oh.  You know what I was thinking about last night, how you did that to her?	

ZAC	Why would you be thinking about her?  This is between you and me.
	
ANDI	I can't represent Jasmin Borders.  There is a clear conflict of interest.
	
AARON	I think you need to think long and hard about this conflict.
	
ANDI	Are you firing me?
	
(END OF TAPE)
