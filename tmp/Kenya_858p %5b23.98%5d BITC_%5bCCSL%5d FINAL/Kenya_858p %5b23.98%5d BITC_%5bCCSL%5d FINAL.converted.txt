NOAH TO JACK	 How can they not have
NOAH TO JACK	 a paved road from the airport?
JACK TO NOAH	 It's a developing nation. I guess they don't have

BILLY TO ZOE	 Ooh.

NOAH TO ZOE	 You think I'm happy about it?
BILLY TO ALL	 This is not cool.
ZOE TO ALL	 Fucking Jack.
ZOE TO ALL	 He doesn't even get us our own rooms.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Stop calling him Jack.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Why don't you call him Dad anymore? It's weird.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Well, you guys can fight over the car.
ZOE TO NOAH	 No, no, no.
NOAH TO ZOE	 I'm not sleeping over there.
LAUREN TO JACK	 When I was a little girl,
LAUREN TO JACK	 I had this book about Africa,
LAUREN TO JACK	 and this mountain was on the cover of it.
LAUREN TO JACK	 And I used to stare at it for hours
LAUREN TO JACK	 just wishing I was there.
LAUREN TO JACK	 And now I'm finally here.
LAUREN TO JACK	 I just can't believe it.
JACK	 [breathes deeply]
JACK TO LAUREN	 Hey, I'm sorry.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I'm sorry if I've been…
LAUREN TO JACK	 An asshole?
JACK TO LAUREN	 I was gonna say distant. But asshole works, yeah.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Sorry, Jack. I know-- I can tell you've got
LAUREN TO JACK	 a lot on your mind.
LAUREN TO JACK	 You know, you could share.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I just want the last family vacation
JACK TO LAUREN	 before Zoe goes off to college to be special. [animals howling]
LAUREN TO JACK	 If she goes off to college.
LAUREN TO JACK	 You heard her, Jack.
JACK TO LAUREN	 She's gonna go to college.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Who drops out of MIT to work in a vegan coffee shop,
JACK TO LAUREN	 for crying out loud?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Is she gonna throw her life away?
LAUREN TO JACK	 Well, I spent seven years in medical school
LAUREN TO JACK	 and haven't worked in 15.
LAUREN TO JACK	 She wants to find herself.
JACK TO LAUREN	 She can find herself after college.
JACK TO LAUREN	 You know, you know what it is?
JACK TO LAUREN	 It's that boyfriend of hers.
JACK TO LAUREN	 That's who's doing this.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I mean, why is he even here, huh?
LAUREN TO JACK	 [scoffs] You want Zoe, you get Billy.
LAUREN TO JACK	 That's young love.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Yeah, he's not that young.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Same age difference as we were.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Yeah. But you didn't make me cut all my hair off.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Quit college.
LAUREN TO JACK	 You never had long hair.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Look, he's a nice kid.
LAUREN TO JACK	 He really likes Zoe. I like him.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Yeah.
JACK TO LAUREN	 You don't have to pay for him.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Gosh, can you just relax, Jack?
LAUREN TO JACK	 Relax.
JACK	 [sighing deep] [phone beeps, vibrating]
JACK TO SELF	 Shoot.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I stink. I'm gonna have a shower. [tap creaks] [shower running] [crow caws] [phone beeps and vibrates] [insects chirping]
BILLY TO ZOE AND NOAH	 Lots of frogs.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Oh, remember that little frog I had?
NOAH TO ZOE	 Ice Cream?
ZOE TO NOAH	 Oh, yeah. Whatever happened to him?
NOAH TO ZOE	 I put him in my pocket and he died.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Jesus, Noah.
NOAH TO ZOE	 I didn't mean to.
BILLY TO INSECT	 Oh, little guy.
BILLY TO INSECT	 I found you.
ZOE TO SELF	 Oh, my God. Oh…
BILLY TO NOAH	 Do you know what this is?
NOAH TO BILLY	 Grass?
BILLY TO NOAH	 No, my friend. Not grass.
BILLY TO NOAH	 This…
BILLY TO NOAH	 is salvia.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Salvia.
BILLY TO ZOE	 Also known as Lady Sally.
BILLY TO ZOE AND NOAH	 Used by many for its analgesic and antispasmodic properties.
BILLY TO ZOE AND NOAH	 But most importantly, it gets you high as fuck.
NOAH TO BILLY	 I'm sure it's just a shrub.
BILLY TO ZOE AND NOAH	 Guess we'll find out in, what?
BILLY TO ZOE AND NOAH	 Twenty minutes?
NOAH TO ZOE	 Zo!
ZOE TO NOAH	 What?
NOAH TO ZOE	 We're like a 100 miles from a hospital.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Oh, my God. You sound like Jack. Ugh.
NOAH TO ZOE	 You know, that actually makes him really upset
NOAH TO ZOE	 when you call him that.
ZOE TO NOAH	 He can take it.
ZOE TO NOAH	 It's fine.
BILLY TO ZOE	 Come on, Zoe.
NOAH TO ZOE	 I'm actually going to do a workout
NOAH TO ZOE	 with Dad before dinner,
NOAH TO ZOE	 doing like an African circuit thing…
ZOE AND BILLY	 [laughing]
NOAH TO ZOE	 Okay.
LAUREN TO JACK	 You've been fired?
JACK TO LAUREN	 You looked… you looked at my phone?
JACK TO LAUREN	 That's an invasion of my--
LAUREN TO JACK	 Don't you dare, Jack.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Give me my phone. Give me my phone. Give me my--
LAUREN TO JACK	 What happened?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Nothing. I wasn't fired. It was…
JACK TO LAUREN	 it's administrative leave-- It is nothing.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Jack! Stop it!
JACK TO LAUREN	 Nothing happened. Okay?
LAUREN TO JACK	 What happened?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Nothing. I just-- there was a small problem
JACK TO LAUREN	 with the Dakota pipeline and it…
JACK TO LAUREN	 it's standard protocol
JACK TO LAUREN	 to put the project manager on administrative leave
JACK TO LAUREN	 while they clean it up.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Clean it up? What?
LAUREN TO JACK	 Was there a spill?
JACK TO LAUREN	 A little bit. It was handled.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I mean, maybe a little late.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Ho-- how bad was it? Why didn't you tell me?
JACK TO LAUREN	 I did-- I didn't tell you because I wanted you
JACK TO LAUREN	 to enjoy this vacation, okay?
JACK TO LAUREN	 God knows it costs enough.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Wait… do we have to worry about money now? I--
JACK TO LAUREN	 Things could get a little tight
JACK TO LAUREN	 and we might need to tighten our belts a little after this. Yeah.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Are you going to be fired?
JACK TO LAUREN	 No, I'm not going to be fired. Okay?
JACK TO LAUREN	 No, it's not like that. I…
JACK TO LAUREN	 I don't think so.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I'll go back as soon as they sort it out.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Can I please have my phone?
ZOE	 [chuckling]
BILLY	 [mumbling]
ZOE TO BILLY	 Wait, Billy. Wow.

NOAH TO JACK	 Fine?
JACK TO NOAH	 He's not distracting you, is he?
NOAH TO JACK	 No, he's not distracting me.
JACK TO NOAH	 All right.
JACK TO NOAH	 It's just, you know, it's… something that your coach said.
NOAH TO JACK	 What?
JACK TO NOAH	 He was just checking if you were okay.
JACK TO NOAH	 I mean, what with all the doctor's appointments
JACK TO NOAH	 that you've been going to over the last few weeks.
JACK TO NOAH	 The ones that conveniently fall between the hours
JACK TO NOAH	 of 6 and 8 p.m., right in the middle of practice.
JACK TO NOAH	 I mean, from where I'm standing,
JACK TO NOAH	 this thing is distracting you.
NOAH TO JACK	 No. Sam is not a thing.
JACK TO NOAH	 You know what I'm saying.
NOAH TO JACK	 Yes, I do know what you're saying.
NOAH TO JACK	 You wish that Sam was my girlfriend.
NOAH TO JACK	 But he's not. He's my boy--
JACK TO NOAH	 That's not-- [overlapping commotion]
JACK TO NOAH	 Hey!
JACK TO NOAH	 I don't know. I don't know. But--
NOAH TO JACK	 What is it?
JACK TO NOAH	 I don't know.
JACK TO LAUREN	 What the hell happened?
LAUREN TO JACK	 It was a hyena.

LAUREN TO MAN	 Oh, I thought he was pretty handsome.
LUCAS TO GUESTS	 He was just looking for food.
LUCAS TO GUESTS	 No harm, everyone.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Hey, are you okay?
LAUREN TO NOAH	 It's a hyena, Noah.
NOAH TO LAUREN	 My God. But they're-- they're kind of dangerous, right?
BILLY TO NOAH	 Well, they're scavengers, bro.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Nature's trash cans, right?
LUCAS TO BILLY	 That's true, Billy.
LUCAS TO BILLY	 But when alone is just harmless.
LUCAS TO GUESTS	 But if they're in a group, they're very dangerous.
LUCAS TO GUESTS	 They can even kill a lion.
LAUREN TO LUCAS	 Okay.
LUCAS TO GUESTS	 If found alone, this can do the magic.
LUCAS TO GUESTS	 It's all you need, really.
LUCAS TO GUESTS	 That's okay. Just go back to having fun.

LUCAS TO JACK	 Of course.
LUCAS TO JACK	 But if you'd like to pay for the extras now…
JACK TO LUCAS	 And how much would that be?
JACK TO ALL	 Great news.
JACK TO ALL	 We get to do our own safari today.
LAUREN TO JACK	 What?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Yeah, yeah. Our friend Lucas back there,
JACK TO ALL	 he just told me we--
JACK TO ALL	 if we want the best experience possible,
JACK TO ALL	 we gotta go into the park on our own.
NOAH TO JACK	 That… doesn't sound… right.
JACK TO NOAH	 It is. It is.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Don't we need a guard?

NOAH TO LAUREN	 Did you bring Kenyan money? [overlapping conversation] [dog barking]
LAUREN TO JACK	 They look like this.
JACK TO LAUREN	 What are you doing?
JACK TO LAUREN	 What are you doing?
LAUREN TO JACK	 Shh. Jack, come on.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Did you bring--
JACK TO LAUREN	 We don't need a belt. [dog barking]
LAUREN TO JACK	 It's so beautiful. This one was made here.
NOAH TO TOURIST	 Hi.
BILLY TO ZOE	 [indistinct].
TOURIST TO OFFICER	 Hey, what's going on?
JACK TO LAUREN	 What do we need a belt for?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Don't-- don't waste our money, hon.
LAUREN TO JACK	 They're made here.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Made-- made here.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Made in China.
NOAH TO WOMAN	 Oh, no thanks.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Wow. What's going on over there?
ZOE TO BILLY	 Why is he--
BILLY TO ZOE	 …poachers.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 I thought they said poaching wasn't really a thing here.
NOAH TO LAUREN	 They don't look like poachers.
ZOE TO NOAH	 And what are poachers supposed to look like?
NOAH TO ZOE	 Not tourists. [dog barking]
BILLY TO ZOE	 Those bastards kill, like,
BILLY TO ZOE	 a 1,000 rhinos a year.
ZOE TO BILLY	 Holy shit. That's three rhinos a day.
JACK TO ZOE	 That's quick math, hon.
LAUREN TO BILLY	 Wait, so you don't think we'll see a rhino?
ZOE TO JACK	 You don't have to sound too shocked, Jack.
BILLY TO LAUREN	 Nah, sorry, Mrs. H.
BILLY TO LAUREN	 They're as rare as pink and fluffy unicorn shit.
JACK TO STAFF MEMBER	 Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. Do you mind?

JACK TO STAFF MEMBER	 Excuse me, sir. Do you mind if--
JACK TO STAFF MEMBER	 do you mind if we just go through? [dog barking]

LAUREN TO JACK	 Jack. Jack, what are you doing?
JACK TO LAUREN	 You wanna go on a safari?
JACK TO LAUREN	 I'm gonna take you on a gosh darn safari.
LAUREN	 [mumbling]
LAUREN TO JACK	 Jack! Jack! Jack! [overlapping arguments and exited shouts]
JACK TO LAUREN	 Sometimes you have to break the rules.
JACK TO LAUREN	 We'll pay when we come out.
NOAH TO JACK	 Yeah! [dog barking at a distance] [insects chirping]
ZOE TO JACK	 Are these the right roads?
ZOE TO JACK	 I don't see any animals.
ZOE TO JACK	 We did come to the right place.
ZOE TO JACK	 Right?
JACK TO ZOE	 There's not much here, is there?
LAUREN TO JACK	 Well, you know, it's not a zoo.
LAUREN TO JACK	 I mean, they're here. They're just not close.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Jack.
JACK TO LAUREN	 What?
LAUREN TO JACK	 What are you doing?
NOAH TO JACK	 We're not allowed that way.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I bet it loops back to the main road.
LAUREN TO JACK	 What makes you think that?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Go check the map.
NOAH TO JACK	 There's no sign.
JACK TO NOAH	 Look, your mom wants to see a rhino.
JACK TO NOAH	 I'm gonna find her a rhino.
JACK TO NOAH	 This… I will make happen.
ZOE TO JACK	 All about breaking the rules today, huh?
JACK TO ZOE	 Looks like it.
JACK TO ZOE	 Hey, if you see a traffic cop, let me know.
BILLY	 [laughs]
JACK TO ALL	 Off-road adventure.
BILLY	 [laughs]
JACK TO ALL	 All right. Watch your head.
JACK TO ALL	 Watch your heads. Just a little--

BILLY TO LAUREN	 Here you go.
BILLY TO LAUREN	 Here you go, Mrs. H.
LAUREN TO BILLY	 Thank you.
BILLY TO ZOE	 I know.
BILLY TO ZOE	 I spy with my little eye something beginning with…
BILLY TO ZOE	 Holy shit.
ZOE TO BILLY	 What?
JACK TO BILLY	 What is it?
BILLY TO ZOE	 No, no. Over there.
NOAH TO BILLY	 I don't think that's how the game works, Billy.
BILLY TO ZOE	 No, no. Over there. Over there. [bird squawking]
ZOE TO BILLY	 Where?
BILLY TO ZOE	 There.
ZOE TO BILLY	 What?
BILLY TO ZOE	 The dead thing in the tree right there.
ZOE TO BILLY	 Ugh.
NOAH TO BILLY	 What is that, a deer?
BILLY TO NOAH	 Maybe an antelope or something?
ZOE TO BILLY	 How did it even get up there?
NOAH TO ZOE	 Jump?
ZOE TO NOAH	 And get stuck?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Can they climb?
LAUREN TO JACK	 No, I don't think so.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Geez.
ZOE TO BILLY	 That's gross.
ZOE TO BILLY	 Billy, that's gross.
BILLY TO ZOE	 Gross?
ZOE TO BILLY	 It's dead.
BILLY TO ZOE	 It's… it's wildlife.
BILLY TO ZOE	 There's flies there. They're alive.
ZOE TO BILLY	 Billy.
BILLY TO ZOE	 I see some maggots over there and some flies.
JACK TO ALL	 All right, come on. Hold on. [indistinct conversation]
NOAH TO JACK	 Wait, wait. Can I get a picture?
JACK TO NOAH	 No, you can't get a picture, Noah.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Ew. Are you a serial killer?
NOAH TO ZOE	 What?
ZOE TO NOAH	 Don't take a picture of that.
NOAH TO ZOE	 We're not gonna see another animal in a tree.
JACK TO NOAH	 I'm sure we will see lots of dead animals.
NOAH TO ZOE	 I'm gonna send it to Sam.
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad?
JACK TO NOAH	 Yeah, bud.
NOAH TO JACK	 Can I drive for a bit?
JACK TO NOAH	 Um. Well, it's a stick.
NOAH TO JACK	 I can drive a stick.
JACK TO NOAH	 I don't know, pal.
JACK TO NOAH	 I don't think the insurance will cover--
NOAH TO JACK	 What? You said you were all about breaking the rules today.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Come on, Jack. Let him drive.
JACK TO LAUREN AND NOAH	 Okay, all right. All right, bud. Yeah, you can drive.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Well, that's us dead.
NOAH TO ZOE	 I'm actually a really good driver.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Mm. I think the back of Dad's Porsche
ZOE TO NOAH	 would disagree with that.
BILLY	 [laughs]
NOAH TO ZOE	 That was not my fault. I buffed it out.
NOAH TO ZOE	 At least I have a license.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Hey, I can drive.
BILLY TO NOAH	 She can drive.
ZOE TO NOAH	 I can drive.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Not according to the state of California.
LAUREN TO ALL	 Guys, guys, guys.
ZOE TO NOAH	 That's just a piece of paper.
NOAH TO ZOE	 It's actually--
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Noah, come on up here.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Want to do it here?
LAUREN TO JACK	 I need my fixin'.
JACK TO LAUREN	 All right. All right. Hold on.
JACK TO LAUREN	 All right.
LAUREN TO JACK	 …my fix. [overlapping conversation]
JACK TO NOAH	 All right. Hop up here, bud.
JACK TO NOAH	 There you go.
JACK TO NOAH	 All right, big guy. There you go. Okay.
JACK TO NOAH	 All right. No more than 10, okay?
NOAH TO JACK	 What? That's walking.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Do it.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Come on, Noah. Put your feet on the gas.
ZOE TO NOAH	 No. 20.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Twenty. No. no.
JACK TO ALL	 Shut up. Okay.
JACK TO NOAH	 Both-- both feet down, right. Clutch all the way
JACK TO NOAH	 to the floor. [gear shift clicks]
JACK TO NOAH	 Over and up. Now, a little bit of gas.
JACK TO NOAH	 Let go of that clutch.
JACK TO NOAH	 That's okay. That's okay.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Oh, wow. Such a good driver.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Way to go, Noah.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Such a good driver. [engine car revving]
ZOE	 [laughs]
BILLY	 [whooping]
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Yeah, there we go.
BILLY	 [whooping]
BILLY TO ALL	 Now we're gonna see some wildlife. [dog barking]
NOAH TO ALL	 We don't want any more zebra. Okay?
ZOE TO NOAH	 Yeah.
LAUREN TO ALL	 Are we bored with zebra?
LAUREN TO ALL	 Gosh, I can't believe-- [overlapping chatter]
LAUREN TO ALL	 Yeah. Whoever thought we'd be bored by a zebra.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Bored by zebras. Bored by zebras, that's right.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Bored by zebras. Right?
JACK TO BILLY AND ZOE	 That is amazing. Billy, Zoe, not again.
LAUREN AND NOAH	 Oh, my!

LAUREN TO ALL	 Oh my… gosh.
LAUREN TO ALL	 My gosh! Oh, my…
ZOE TO SELF	 Oh, wow.

LAUREN TO NOAH	 Hey guys, can we get a little closer?

LAUREN TO ALL	 Oh, wow. This is unbelievable.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Just a little, ah! Giant animal with a spike on its face.
BILLY TO ALL	 What could possibly go wrong?
NOAH TO LAUREN	 Mom, are you getting the picture? [camera clicking]
LAUREN TO NOAH	 I mean, never in my wildest dreams.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 [baby rhino crying] Are you seeing-- [gasps]
LAUREN TO SELF	 Oh, wow.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Oh, wow.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Zoe, look at this. Is this--
LAUREN TO ZOE	 is that a baby? Look, is that a baby?
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Oh, my God. That is so cute.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Hi! Look at the baby.
BILLY TO ALL	 Wait, we shouldn't be getting
BILLY TO ALL	 between them. Right?
JACK TO BILLY	 Yeah, I can't believe
JACK TO BILLY	 I'm saying this, but I agree with you, Billy.
JACK TO NOAH	 Back, back it up just a bit.
NOAH TO JACK	 Wait, I'm not--
NOAH TO JACK	 Wait, I'm not good at reversing.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Lauren, Lauren. Would you get down, honey?
NOAH TO JACK	 Is that in reverse?
JACK TO NOAH	 That's in reverse. There you go. There you go.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Oh, my God. Noah, back it up. [rhino growling]
ZOE TO NOAH	 Noah, back it up!
JACK TO NOAH	 It's okay.
NOAH TO ALL	 I'm sorry. Sorry, okay? [car engine revving]
ZOE TO NOAH	 Oh, my gosh. Stop it. Noah!
NOAH TO JACK	 I'm not good at reversing, I'm sorry.
JACK TO NOAH	 Slowly. There you go.
LAUREN TO ALL	 Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. [rhino growling]

LAUREN TO JACK	 But you know what? You're bleeding badly.
JACK TO LAUREN	 That's okay. Is everyone okay?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 I'll be right there, Zoe.

LAUREN TO ZOE	 Okay, I remember how brave you were.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 No. I wasn't brave.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 I'm not, Mom. What! Billy--
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Brace it from behind. There we go. [bone cracking]
LAUREN	 [grunting]
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Oh, fuck!
ZOE	 [cries]

LAUREN TO ALL AND JACK	 I'm fine. I'm fine. Jack?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Ah, yeah, yeah.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Okay.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Thank you. Okay.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Baby, I would have done the same.
JACK TO LAUREN	 That's okay. It's okay.
JACK TO ALL	 You guys all right?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Are you okay, Zoe?
NOAH TO ALL	 If I would've-- if I would've just backed up…
NOAH TO ALL	 faster.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Been able to drive faster?
JACK TO ZOE	 It's done now. It's done, all right?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Zoe, lay off.
BILLY TO ALL	 Ah, jeez.
JACK TO ALL	 Well, let's, uh, let's see if we can right this thing.
JACK TO ALL	 See if it still drives.
ZOE TO JACK	 What? How are we gonna do that?
LAUREN TO JACK	 Yeah. How are we gonna do that, Jack?
JACK TO ALL	 We're gonna act like a family.
JACK TO ALL	 All right. We're gonna work together.
BILLY TO JACK	 [sighs] Yeah, we got to try, man.
JACK TO ALL	 Right.
JACK TO ALL	 All right, let's get some legs and arms on each corner.
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad, this thing's not gonna move.
BILLY TO JACK	 [indistinct].
BILLY TO JACK	 On three, right?
JACK TO BILLY	 Yep.
ALL	 One, two, three.
ALL	 [grunting]
JACK	 [grunting]
LAUREN TO ALL	 Well, we tried.
NOAH TO ALL	 Let me just get my phone.
NOAH TO ALL	 Where's my phone? We can call for help.
JACK TO SELF	 Come on.
NOAH TO ALL	 Ah! I don't have any signal.
LAUREN TO ALL	 Hey, guys, stay close.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Don't go too far, okay? Noah?
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Yeah. I don't [indistinct].
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Well, I mean, let's stay close to each other
LAUREN TO ZOE	 and the van.
NOAH TO ALL	 Does anybody have a signal?
BILLY TO JACK	 Here you go, Mr. H.
JACK	 [sighing]
JACK TO BILLY	 Thanks, Billy.
JACK TO LAUREN	 It's gonna cost a fortune.
LAUREN TO JACK	 The important thing is everybody's alive, okay?
LAUREN TO JACK	 Insurance will cover it.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Te-- tell me you got insurance. You got insurance?
JACK TO LAUREN	 I got insurance. Yeah.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Great.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Fully comp was expensive.
LAUREN TO JACK	 What-- what… what are we gonna do?
LAUREN TO JACK	 We've got no car, no signal.
LAUREN TO JACK	 What are we gonna do?
JACK TO LAUREN	 I… don't know. Do you?
LAUREN TO JACK	 No. No. I don't.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Then how about… how about a little equality?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Because I'm no more equipped to deal with any of this
JACK TO LAUREN	 than any of you.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Besides, someone will find us. Someone will realize
JACK TO LAUREN	 that we haven't checked back into the lodge.
ZOE TO JACK	 No, they won't.
ZOE TO JACK	 You drove through the gate without registering.
ZOE TO JACK	 Do you remember?
ZOE TO JACK	 No one knows that we're here.
NOAH TO ZOE AND JACK	 Okay, so we go back out
NOAH TO ZOE AND JACK	 onto one of the main roads and get some help.
NOAH TO ZOE AND JACK	 I mean, there were cars that were passing by.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 We can't go walking through the bush.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 That's crazy.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Aren't you supposed to wait
ZOE TO LAUREN	 by where the accident happened?
BILLY TO ZOE	 That's right.
ZOE TO ALL	 That's what they teach you. Wait, and then someone comes.
BILLY TO ZOE	 On a closed back road?
NOAH TO ALL	 Yeah, exactly. How is anyone gonna find us here?
BILLY TO NOAH	 We start a fire.
ZOE TO BILLY	 That's a good idea.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Billy, can you start a fire?
BILLY TO ALL	 I saw it on TV.
BILLY TO ALL	 Naked and Afraid.
BILLY TO ALL	 You know, they do it all the time.
BILLY TO ALL	 Rub sticks together.
ZOE TO ALL	 Yeah, you can start a fire. Just take the battery wires
ZOE TO ALL	 from the sparkplug and make a short circuit.
ZOE TO ALL	 Total fuck.
NOAH TO ZOE	 How are you gonna do that?
ZOE TO NOAH	 Yeah, I know, the current hasn't stopped
ZOE TO NOAH	 because the terminal's fucked.
JACK TO ZOE	 You know, that's not as dumb as it sounds, sweetheart.
ZOE TO JACK	 Oh, I'm sorry. Did it sound dumb?
LAUREN	 [puking]
JACK TO LAUREN	 Geez, babe.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Oh, my God, Mom?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Honey?
BILLY TO LAUREN	 You all right?
LAUREN TO JACK	 I'm fine. I'm just a little…
LAUREN TO JACK	 a little anxious. Ah.
BILLY TO LAUREN	 You're shaking, Mrs. H. Are you cold?
ZOE TO BILLY	 She's not cold. It's 500 fucking degrees.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Are you cold?
LAUREN TO JACK	 No, I, uh…
LAUREN TO ALL	 could someone get my insulin?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Okay.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Noah.
JACK TO NOAH	 It's in her bag, Noah.
NOAH TO JACK	 Okay.
JACK TO NOAH	 [indistinct].
NOAH TO JACK	 Where is it?
JACK TO NOAH	 [grunting] It's in her little bag.
JACK TO NOAH	 Her little purse that she wore.
JACK TO NOAH	 That's it. That's it, bud.
JACK TO NOAH	 It's a black… it's a black purse.
LAUREN TO ZOE AMD BILLY	 I'm fine.
JACK TO NOAH	 There you go, bud.
JACK TO NOAH	 There you go. There you go.
JACK TO NOAH	 You're kidding me.
LAUREN TO JACK	 No. I'll be fine.
LAUREN TO JACK	 My glucose levels are high so I'll feel a little rough,
LAUREN TO JACK	 but I'll be… maybe a little water.
LAUREN TO BILLY	 Thanks, Billy. [bottles clanking]
BILLY TO LAUREN	 No water.
LAUREN TO BILLY	 What?
JACK TO BILLY	 We brought water.
BILLY TO JACK	 The glass bottles broke.
JACK TO BILLY	 Oh, my gosh.
NOAH TO BILLY AND ZOE	 Oh, that's-- that's great. Save the planet.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Shut up.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Come on, dude.
LAUREN TO ALL	 Guys, please stop.
LAUREN TO ALL	 Not now.
JACK TO ALL	 Okay. Okay.
LAUREN TO JACK	 We've got some time. About a half a day.
BILLY TO ZOE	 Are you all right?
ZOE TO BILLY	 [crying] Diabetic ketoacidosis.
BILLY TO ZOE	 What does that mean?
ZOE TO BILLY	 It means in about eight hours,
ZOE TO BILLY	 she's gonna be in a coma.
ZOE TO BILLY	 And then… [hyena growling]
BILLY TO ZOE	 [whispers] Oh, geez.
JACK TO LAUREN AND NOAH	 Hey, hey, there's something over there. [hyena growling] [hyena laughing]
BILLY TO JACK	 What did the guy at the lodge say?
BILLY TO JACK	 One is not a problem, right?
JACK TO BILLY	 Right. Right.
BILLY TO JACK	 Okay. I got this.
ZOE TO BILLY	 Billy. [whispering] Billy.
LAUREN TO BILLY	 Don't.
BILLY	 Go on.
BILLY	 [hyena laughing]
BILLY	 Go on.
BILLY	 Hey, fuck right off, you mangy half dog. [hyena laughing]
BILLY	 [laughs]
BILLY TO ALL	 I didn't think that would actually work.
BILLY TO ALL	 You gotta get primal!
JACK TO ALL	 Guys, guys, guys.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Billy.
JACK TO BILLY	 Hey, Billy.
ZOE TO BILLY	 Oh, shit. Billy.
JACK TO ALL	 Get in the van. Get in the van. [hyenas laughing]
BILLY TO ALL	 Oh, shit.

JACK TO ALL	 Get in the van. Guys, get in the van.
JACK TO ALL	 Come here. Get in. Come on. Get in.
LAUREN TO BILLY	 Billy, get in. [hyenas' laughter continues]
NOAH TO LAUREN	 What are we gonna do?
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Just keep still and be quiet. [hyenas laughing] [clattering] [tapping] [hyenas' laughter continues]
ZOE TO BILLY	 Billy. [clattering] [crash]
JACK	 [groans]
JACK	 [panting]
JACK TO LAUREN	 I think they're gone.
JACK TO LAUREN	 We're gonna be okay. [hyenas howling] [hyenas growling] [wind whooshing] [insects chirping]
JACK	 [sighs]
JACK TO LAUREN	 Hey. Are you okay?
LAUREN TO JACK	 Yeah. It's just hot.
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad.
NOAH TO JACK	 Does the AC work?
JACK TO NOAH	 Well…
JACK TO NOAH	 Nope. No, it still doesn't work.
LAUREN TO JACK	 It's still not working.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Still not working.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Mom, you got to get in the shade.
BILLY TO ALL	 Oh, wait. We can make a sunshade
BILLY TO ALL	 out of this blanket.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Give me a hand, Noah.
JACK TO NOAH	 Take it through here and trap it in that window.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 What are you doing, Mom?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 I'm making you a sling.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 We need to keep your arm still.
LAUREN TO BILLY	 Billy, can you please wrap it up in this?
ZOE TO ALL	 You guys know we can't stay here, though, right?
ZOE TO ALL	 Like the hyenas are gonna come back.
JACK TO ZOE	 I think we should wait.
JACK TO ZOE	 I mean, you said so yourself.
ZOE TO JACK	 Yeah, but that was BH.
BILLY TO JACK	 Before hyena.
JACK TO ALL	 Someone will come after us.
NOAH TO ALL	 Is there any water left in those bottles?
NOAH TO ALL	 Is there any at all?
JACK TO ALL	 There's tourists all over this place.
LAUREN TO JACK	 This… This place is the size of--
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Yeah. New York.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 We know, Mom.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Hey, we're gonna stay put.
JACK TO LAUREN	 That's my decision. That's final. Okay?
ZOE TO JACK	 Oh, you made that decision?
ZOE TO JACK	 So, we have no say in that?
JACK TO ZOE	 That's right.
NOAH	 [coughs]
ZOE TO JACK	 [whispers] My God. You're such a dick.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Zoe, stop.
JACK TO ZOE	 What--
JACK TO ZOE	 what did you say, young lady?
ZOE TO JACK	 That you're a dick.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Oh, Zoe.
JACK TO ZOE	 Oh.
JACK TO ZOE	 Okay, well, well, uh, you're right. I am.
JACK TO ZOE	 So, let's see those, um, those festival tickets?
JACK TO ZOE	 Canceled. They're trash.
JACK TO ZOE	 And your phone payment? That's gone.
JACK TO ZOE	 Uh, your allowance? See you later.
LAUREN TO JACK	 How is this helping?
JACK TO LAUREN	 It's not, but I'm a dick! Remember?
JACK TO ZOE	 That's how dicks act, right?
ZOE TO JACK	 Mm-hm.
JACK TO ZOE	 Yeah. Okay, well.
ZOE TO JACK	 Guess what?
ZOE TO JACK	 The joke's on you, Jack.
ZOE TO JACK	 I don't need festival tickets if we're all fucking dead.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Zoe!
JACK TO ZOE	 Don't call me Jack!
JACK TO ZOE	 Goddammit, Zoe!
NOAH TO ALL	 Be quiet.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Zoe, nobody's dying.
JACK TO ZOE	 I'm your father.
ZOE TO JACK	 Technically, you're not.
JACK TO ZOE	 Jesus, Zoe.
NOAH TO ALL	 Can you guys not argue right now?
NOAH TO ALL	 Can you just save it for later, please?
JACK TO ALL	 I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
JACK TO ZOE	 I'm sorry, Zoe.
ZOE TO JACK	 Sorry, too. [insects chirping] [bird squawking] [wind whooshing] [birds tweeting]
LAUREN TO JACK	 There's no signal.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Not here, but…
JACK TO LAUREN	 Maybe back there. There was higher ground back there.
JACK TO LAUREN	 If there's a signal anywhere,
JACK TO LAUREN	 that's where it's gonna be.
LAUREN TO JACK	 What are you doing?
JACK TO LAUREN	 I am gonna make a call.
LAUREN TO JACK	 You can't go anywhere, Jack.
JACK TO LAUREN	 You need your insulin.
LAUREN TO JACK	 My glucose levels are high.
LAUREN TO JACK	 That's it.
JACK TO LAUREN	 What about in an hour… or two, huh?
ZOE TO JACK	 Jack, I don't think you can make it up that hill.
JACK TO ZOE	 I'll crawl if I have to.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Then I'll go with you.
JACK TO LAUREN	 That's crazy.
LAUREN TO JACK	 No crazier than you.
NOAH TO ALL	 I'll go.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Noah…
NOAH TO ALL	 I'll go.
NOAH TO ALL	 I'm-I'm faster than anyone else here.
BILLY TO ALL	 [scoffs] Rude.
LAUREN TO NOAH	 No.
NOAH TO LAUREN	 Why?
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Because no.
NOAH TO ALL	 Why? You don't think I can make it?
JACK TO NOAH	 It's not that. It's just…
JACK TO NOAH	 It's not safe.
BILLY TO ALL	 I'll go with him.
BILLY TO ALL	 Keep your little superstar out of trouble.
BILLY TO ALL	 Two sets of eyes and all that.
NOAH TO ALL	 That's fine with me.
ZOE TO BILLY	 Wait, no. What if the hyenas come back?
BILLY TO ZOE	 Then you just use your angry voice with them.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Or just use your normal voice. Same thing.
ZOE TO NOAH	 You're a brat.
JACK TO NOAH	 You wanna take this in case
JACK TO NOAH	 your signal is different?
LAUREN TO NOAH AND BILLY	 Please. Please be safe.
BILLY TO LAUREN	 Thanks, Missus H.
JACK TO NOAH AND BILLY	 Careful. [insects chirping] [bird calling]
NOAH TO SELF	 Geez. [birds chirping] [animal roars]
NOAH TO SELF	 Oh, shit. [bird squawking]
NOAH TO BILLY	 What the hell was that?
BILLY TO NOAH	 Are you scared?
NOAH TO BILLY	 Oh, hell yeah.
NOAH TO BILLY	 But anything's better than staying in the van
NOAH TO BILLY	 with everyone arguing.
NOAH TO BILLY	 What are you doing?
BILLY TO NOAH	 Never trust trees, bud.
BILLY TO NOAH	 They play tricks on you.
NOAH TO BILLY	 You smoke too much weed.
BILLY TO NOAH	 [scoffs] You don't smoke enough.
BILLY TO NOAH	 It might help you chill.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Hell no, dude. They drug test at school.
BILLY TO NOAH	 [grunts] Well, be a good way to get you off the team.
BILLY TO NOAH	 I know you want to.
NOAH TO BILLY	 No, I don't. It'd crush Dad.
BILLY TO NOAH	 You shouldn't be doing it just for him anyway.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Come out as gay and get kicked off the team?
NOAH TO BILLY	 No, I think it's one or the other.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Yeah. Zoe said he was upset.
NOAH TO BILLY	 He's not upset. He's just… I don't know.
NOAH TO BILLY	 He's confused. You know? I mean, he doesn't get it.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Who even gives a shit anyway.
NOAH TO BILLY	 I don't know. He's thinks it's gonna ruin my career.
NOAH TO BILLY	 I'm not gonna get a scholarship.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Even if I do, I'll get crucified for being gay.
BILLY TO NOAH	 A little too keen on the wrong type of balls.
BILLY	 [chuckles]
NOAH TO BILLY	 Jesus, Billy.
BILLY TO NOAH	 What? It-- it was funny. [bird squawking] [insects chirping]
BILLY	 [howls]
BILLY TO NOAH	 I can think of worse places to die.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Hey, nobody's gonna die.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Nobody's gonna die. Okay?
BILLY TO NOAH	 Well, actually, everyone is.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Anyone ever told you you're kind of a dick?
BILLY TO NOAH	 [chuckles] Yeah, your sister may have mentioned it
BILLY TO NOAH	 once or twice.
BILLY TO NOAH	 And your dad. But he's a dick, too.
BILLY TO NOAH	 So, we cancel each other out.
NOAH TO BILLY	 He's not a dick.
NOAH TO BILLY	 He's not always a dick, okay? He's--
BILLY TO NOAH	 Oh. Come on, dude.
BILLY TO NOAH	 All white men in suits are fucking everything up for us.
BILLY TO NOAH	 They're fucking this up for us, man.
BILLY TO NOAH	 You down with that?
NOAH TO BILLY	 No, but I mean, it's not just him, right?
NOAH TO BILLY	 I mean, we all do it.
NOAH TO BILLY	 It's always someone else's responsibility.
NOAH TO BILLY	 We-- we did a project about mining cobalt in the Congo
NOAH TO BILLY	 for cell phone batteries.
NOAH TO BILLY	 You know how much… violence there is?
NOAH TO BILLY	 Corruption. Child labor.
NOAH TO BILLY	 All for this.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Oil is nothing, man.
NOAH TO BILLY	 We're all greedy. No one really cares.
BILLY TO NOAH	 Fuck, Noah.
BILLY TO NOAH	 You're making it quite difficult for me
BILLY TO NOAH	 to maintain my essentially positive attitude.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Wait a minute.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Dude.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Do you see that?
NOAH TO BILLY	 Do you see that?
NOAH TO BILLY	 Right there?
NOAH TO BILLY	 It could be like a, like a lodge
NOAH TO BILLY	 or like a ranger station.
NOAH TO BILLY	 Give me-- give me the binoculars.
BILLY TO NOAH	 I thought you had them.
NOAH TO BILLY	 How much of that grass you been eatin'?
BILLY TO NOAH	 Not enough.
NOAH TO BILLY	 I think we can make it.
NOAH TO BILLY	 What do you think?
BILLY TO NOAH	 I don't know, man. That is a long-- [leopard growls]
BILLY	 [screams and grunts]
NOAH	 Oh, my God!
BILLY	 [screams] Fuck off me. [leopard growls]
NOAH TO BILLY	 Billy! [leopard growling]
BILLY	 Fuck off!
BILLY	 Oh, my God.
BILLY	 [groans] [leopard snarls]
NOAH	 Oh, my God. Oh, shit.
NOAH	 [panting]
BILLY	 [screaming]
BILLY	 Oh, my God. [leopard snarls]
BILLY	 [screaming]
NOAH	 [yells]
NOAH	 Okay.
NOAH	 [yells]
NOAH	 Billy?
NOAH	 Billy?
NOAH TO SELF	 Oh, my God. [bird hooting]
NOAH	 [yells] Billy? [bird hooting]
NOAH	 [panting]
NOAH TO SELF	 Shit.
NOAH	 [panting]
NOAH	 [groans]
NOAH	 [groans]
NOAH TO SELF	 Oh, man.
NOAH	 [panting] [birds chirping]
NOAH TO SELF	 Turn around.
NOAH TO SELF	 Okay.
NOAH TO SELF	 Okay. Oh. Fuck shit.
NOAH TO SELF	 Okay. Oh, oh.
NOAH TO SELF	 Oh, yes.
NOAH TO SELF	 Okay. Yes, Billy.
NOAH TO SELF	 Yes. Okay. [bird squawking]
LAUREN	 [moaning] Hm-mm.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Mom?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Yeah.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 How are you feeling?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 I'm fine.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Maybe just a little water?
ZOE TO LAUREN	 There is no water, Mom.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Remember?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Yeah. [car rattles]
JACK TO NOAH	 Geez.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Did you guys get a signal?
JACK TO NOAH	 Noah.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Where's Billy?
NOAH TO ALL	 Something got him.
NOAH TO ALL	 Something got him.
JACK TO NOAH	 What?!
ZOE TO NOAH	 What?
NOAH TO ALL	 A big cat. It was a big fucking cat.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Wait, wait. You just left him?
NOAH TO ZOE	 I couldn't do anything. It just ripped his neck out.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Just ripped it clean out.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Oh, my God.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Zoe. Zoe.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Jack, get Zoe.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Yeah. I got her. I got her. Zoe!
NOAH	 [coughing]
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Are you okay?
JACK TO ZOE	 Zoe, sweetheart. Zoe, wait. Damn it, Zoe.
JACK TO ZOE	 It's not safe.
JACK TO ZOE	 Dammit! Zoe! [birds chirping] [insects chirping]
JACK TO ZOE	 [groans] Zoe. Zoe.
JACK TO ZOE	 Oh, God. Zoe, baby.
ZOE	 [cries]
ZOE TO JACK	 I don't know which way to go.
JACK TO ZOE	 Baby. I'm so sorry.
JACK TO ZOE	 Hey, I'm sorry. It is gonna be all right. Okay?
ZOE TO JACK	 I need to get to Billy.
JACK TO ZOE	 We can't because it's not safe, okay?
JACK TO ZOE	 Come here.
JACK TO ZOE	 You heard what your brother said. Right?
ZOE TO JACK	 He's not my brother, and you're not my fucking dad.
JACK TO ZOE	 Hey, he is your brother.
ZOE TO JACK	 No, he's not.
JACK TO ZOE	 And I am your dad.
JACK TO ZOE	 And I have been for 16 years.
JACK TO ZOE	 And that is not going to change
JACK TO ZOE	 because you're pissed off at me at the moment, all right?
JACK TO ZOE	 Now something took Billy.
JACK TO ZOE	 Hey, and there's nothing that we can do about it.
JACK TO ZOE	 And we need to get out of here.
ZOE TO JACK	 My dad is dead.
ZOE TO JACK	 And now Billy is dead.
ZOE TO JACK	 And now Mom is dying, too.
JACK TO ZOE	 Your mom's not gonna die.
JACK TO ZOE	 Your mom is not gonna die.
JACK TO ZOE	 And we're gonna make it out of this
JACK TO ZOE	 and she's gonna be fine. I promise. I promise.
ZOE TO JACK	 She's not. She's not.
JACK TO ZOE	 Okay. Come here. Come here. Come here.
ZOE TO JACK	 No, no, no, no.
JACK TO ZOE	 Stop. Stop. Stop.
ZOE TO JACK	 [crying] Billy. I need Billy.
JACK TO ZOE	 He's gone, baby.
JACK TO ZOE	 He's gone. Okay?
ZOE TO JACK	 [crying] I need Billy.
ZOE TO JACK	 Please get me Billy back. [flies buzzing] [cheetah growling]
BILLY	 [groans] [cheetah growling]
BILLY	 [groans] [flies buzzing] [animal howling]
JACK TO ZOE	 Zoe. [hyenas laughing] Zoe.
ZOE TO JACK	 What?
JACK TO ZOE	 Just, um…. [hyenas laughing]
JACK TO ZOE	 You wait right here.
ZOE TO JACK	 What? Fuck that.
ZOE AND JACK	 Hey!
ZOE	 Hey!
JACK	 Get out of here. Go on.
JACK TO LAUREN AND NOAH	 All right. They're gone.
JACK TO LAUREN AND NOAH	 Are you okay?
LAUREN TO JACK	 They will be back.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Jack, get in.
ZOE	 [groans]
JACK	 [groans]
LAUREN TO JACK	 They'll be back… [bird hooting]
LAUREN TO JACK	 with more.
BILLY	 [breathing deeply]
BILLY	 [grunting] [cheetah growling]
BILLY	 [grunts] [cheetah growling] [cheetah roars]
BILLY	 [grunts] [Billy and cheetah thud to the ground] [insects chirping] [barking] [bird hooting]
JACK TO ALL	 Guys, we…we gotta get out of here.
ZOE TO JACK	 Where are we gonna go?
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad, I think I saw a camp from the top of the hill.
JACK TO NOAH	 Okay, how far?
NOAH TO JACK	 I don't know. Um, um, two miles…
NOAH TO JACK	 that way.
NOAH TO JACK	 I-I think it's north.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Hey, Lauren, can you walk?
LAUREN TO JACK	 You bet I can.
JACK TO ALL	 Come on. Let's go.
JACK TO ZOE	 Come on.
JACK TO ZOE	 Watch your head, baby. Come on.
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad.
JACK TO NOAH	 Thanks, bud.
JACK TO NOAH	 Hey, grab your mom's purse. Okay?
ZOE TO JACK	 So we're… we're gonna walk.
JACK TO ZOE	 Yeah, I think we should.
JACK TO ALL	 It's not just my decision. We all need to agree on this.
LAUREN TO JACK	 What choice do we have?
JACK TO ALL	 All right, then. Let's do this.
LAUREN TO JACK	 All right. [insects chirping] [insects chirping] [birds hooting]
BILLY	 [shaking with sobs] [flies buzzing]
BILLY	 [grunting]
BILLY TO SELF	 Okay.
BILLY TO SELF	 Okay.
BILLY	 [breathes heavily]
BILLY	 [grunting]
BILLY	 [vomits] [birds hooting]
JACK TO NOAH	 Hey, hey, bud.
JACK TO NOAH	 Bud, we gotta stay on the main road.
NOAH TO JACK	 It's this way.
JACK TO NOAH	 Yeah, but I think
JACK TO NOAH	 if we stay on the main road, we have a better chance
JACK TO NOAH	 of someone driving by and finding us.
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad, it's in this direction.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Anyone driving by? We're on a closed road, Jack.
JACK TO NOAH	 Look, Noah.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I know that, honey, I remember that.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Okay, I think we should follow Noah's lead.
JACK TO LAUREN	 All right, fine. Let's just follow Noah's lead
JACK TO LAUREN	 because my ideas are shit today, aren't they?
JACK TO NOAH	 Hey, bud.
JACK TO NOAH	 Noah, it's just kind of important.
JACK TO NOAH	 Okay. Are you sure it's that way?
NOAH TO JACK	 Yeah. I--I think so. Yes.
JACK TO NOAH	 You think so or you know so,
JACK TO NOAH	 because this is a matter of life and death.
ZOE TO JACK	 Don't bully him.
JACK TO ZOE	 I'm not bullying him, Zoe.
ZOE TO JACK	 You always do this.
ZOE TO JACK	 It's why he's so nervous all the time.
NOAH TO ALL	 I'm not nervous all the time.
JACK TO NOAH	 You think I bully you?
NOAH TO JACK	 Yeah, sometimes.
NOAH TO JACK	 That's just your way, right?
JACK	 [scoffs]
NOAH TO JACK	 That's just how you are, right?
JACK TO NOAH	 What do you mean, how I am?
LAUREN TO JACK	 [whispers] Jack.
JACK TO NOAH	 You used to be able to handle my shit, bud.
LAUREN	 [sighs deeply]
NOAH TO JACK	 Yes, Dad.
NOAH TO JACK	 I used to be able to handle your shit
NOAH TO JACK	 and I can still handle your shit.
NOAH TO JACK	 But it's this way. I saw it from the hill.
JACK TO NOAH	 I'm sorry. It's just kind of important.
JACK TO NOAH	 Because if we go in there and it's wrong,
JACK TO NOAH	 we might never come out again.
NOAH TO JACK	 Yes, Dad. I understand that.
NOAH TO JACK	 I'm not a child. It is this way.
JACK TO NOAH	 Okay then, I believe you. Let's go, bud.
JACK TO NOAH	 Let's go.
ZOE TO JACK	 Let's hope he's right, Jack. [insects chirping]
BILLY TO SELF	 Huh.
BILLY TO SELF	 Oh, thank you, divine goddess,
BILLY TO SELF	 [exhales] and also fuck you for doing this to me.
BILLY TO SELF	 Ha.
BILLY	 Hey, guys. Hey…
BILLY	 Guys?
BILLY	 [panting]
BILLY TO SELF	 What's going on?
JACK TO ALL	 Keep moving, okay?
ZOE TO JACK	 Wait, wait, wait. No, we're going in circles.
ZOE TO JACK	 We already passed this tree, Jack.
JACK TO ZOE	 Baby, we have passed thousands of trees.
JACK TO ZOE	 How do you know we've passed this one before?
ZOE TO JACK	 I recognize its face.
JACK TO ZOE	 Its face?
NOAH TO ZOE	 Never trust trees. They play tricks.
ZOE TO NOAH	 What?
NOAH TO ZOE	 Just something I heard.
JACK TO ALL	 Okay.
JACK TO ALL	 Let's go.
ZOE TO JACK	 Can you listen to me for two seconds?
ZOE TO JACK	 I'm not a complete moron. We've been here before.
JACK TO ZOE	 Baby, no, we haven't.
JACK TO ZOE	 We have been walking in a straight line.
ZOE TO JACK	 You know, you and I have the exact same
ZOE TO JACK	 amount of experience being lost in Africa.
ZOE TO JACK	 You do know that, right?
JACK TO ZOE	 Why do you always do this?
ZOE TO JACK	 Do what?
JACK TO ZOE	 Argue.
ZOE TO JACK	 Because not everybody who isn't you
ZOE TO JACK	 is as stupid as you think that they are.
JACK TO ZOE	 That's very clever.
LAUREN TO JACK	 Wait, she's right.
LAUREN TO JACK	 We were here 30 minutes ago.
JACK TO LAUREN	 No. No, we weren't.
JACK TO LAUREN	 We, uh, come on.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Come on, baby.
ZOE TO JACK	 You're an idiot. You're an idiot.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Zoe?
ZOE TO NOAH	 What?
NOAH TO ZOE	 Don't talk to Dad like that.
ZOE TO NOAH	 You mean, your dad.
NOAH TO ZOE	 No, I mean, our dad, Zoe.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Come on. You're 18, not eight.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Let's go.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Come on.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. [footsteps] [insects chirping]
JACK	 [grunts] [flies buzzing]
ZOE TO SELF	 Holy shit.
NOAH TO SELF	 Oh, my God. [flies buzzing]
NOAH TO ALL	 What happened to its face?
LAUREN TO NOAH	 Poachers took its horn. [baby rhino crying]
ZOE TO ALL	 Oh, God. She had a baby.
JACK TO ALL	 This…
JACK TO ALL	 This is the rhino that…
JACK TO ALL	 Wow, that is poetic justice, huh.
ZOE TO JACK	 What the fuck?
JACK TO ZOE	 What!
ZOE TO JACK	 What the fuck--
JACK TO ZOE	 That thing caused all of this.
LAUREN TO JACK	 She was just protecting her baby, Jack.
LAUREN TO JACK	 We have to help it.
JACK TO LAUREN	 How? We can't help that.
JACK TO LAUREN	 We need to help you first.
LAUREN TO JACK	 I'm not leaving it. [baby rhino cries]
JACK TO LAUREN	 We will come back.
JACK TO LAUREN	 We will come back and make sure that baby's okay.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I swear. [baby rhino cries]
JACK TO LAUREN	 Come on. I promise.
LAUREN TO JACK	 I'm not leaving it, Jack.
JACK TO LAUREN	 I swear. I swear.
JACK TO LAUREN	 We'll come back.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Hm?
JACK TO LAUREN	 I swear.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Come on. Come on. [baby rhino cries] [rhino continues crying] [flies buzzing] [insects chirping]
NOAH TO LAUREN	 Mom? Mom?
JACK TO LAUREN	 Hey, babe. Hey, baby.
JACK TO LAUREN	 Grab her scarf.
LAUREN	 [vomiting]
LAUREN TO ALL	 Guys, I'm fine. I'm, it's, uh--
JACK TO LAUREN	 Are you sure?
LAUREN TO ALL	 I'm just dehydrated.
LAUREN TO ALL	 Let's keep moving forward, guys. Come on.
JACK TO ZOE	 She'll be okay. She'll be okay. [insects chirping] [bird hooting] [car approaching] [car door slams]
MAN TO WOMAN	 There's nobody around.
MAN TO WOMAN	 Shout. Shout.
MAN TO WOMAN	 [indistinct].
MAN TO WOMAN	 Can you say "Hello."
MAN TO WOMAN	 Shout loudly. [loud knock]
MAN	 Hello?
MAN	 Anybody's there? [loud knock]
MAN	 Hello?
MAN TO WOMAN	 Check it. Check it. [knocking]
MAN	 Hello?
MAN	 Aaah!!
LAUREN TO JACK	 Are you okay?
JACK TO LAUREN	 I'm okay. [bird hooting]
ZOE TO NOAH	 Really?
LAUREN TO ALL	 Really?
ZOE TO NOAH	 A river.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Didn't you see a river from the hill?
NOAH TO ZOE	 No. Sorry.
JACK	 [unzips zipper]
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Hey, Mom.
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Huh?
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Hey, are you okay?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Yeah. I'm fine.
ZOE TO LAUREN	 Are you sure?
LAUREN TO ZOE	 Mm.
JACK TO NOAH	 All right. [exhales]
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 Okay, well…
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 we could be here.
ZOE TO JACK	 Yeah, or here.
NOAH TO JACK	 Or here.
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 So we could be anywhere.
NOAH TO JACK	 Yes, but if we're here--
ZOE TO JACK	 Yeah, or here.
NOAH TO JACK AND ZOE	 --then these could be the buildings I saw.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Okay, that makes sense, right?
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 Why don't you figure that out?
NOAH TO ZOE	 Zoe.
JACK TO SELF	 [grunting] Oh, shit.
LAUREN TO JACK	 You shouldn't be walking on that.
JACK TO LAUREN	 [chuckles] What are you, a doctor?
JACK	 [sighs deeply]
LAUREN TO JACK	 It's funny.
LAUREN TO JACK	 They teach you in medical school that…
LAUREN TO JACK	 dying isn't nearly as painful
LAUREN TO JACK	 as it looks from the outside.
LAUREN TO JACK	 It's bunch of bullshit. This sucks.
JACK TO LAUREN	 You know we're gonna have to cross that river,
JACK TO LAUREN	 right, baby?
JACK	 [inhales and exhales deeply]
JACK TO LAUREN	 I think you can do that.
LAUREN TO JACK	 I think I can do that.
LAUREN TO JACK	 But I can't feel any of my limbs.
JACK	 [chuckles]
LAUREN	 [chuckles]
JACK TO LAUREN	 Come on. [bird squawking]
NOAH TO ZOE	 You think we can drink it?
ZOE TO NOAH	 Sure.
ZOE TO NOAH	 If you want to shit out maggots the rest of your life.
NOAH TO ZOE	 I'll take those odds right now.
ZOE	 [chuckles]
JACK TO ZOE	 Zoe, come here.
JACK TO NOAH	 Noah, come here.
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 Okay. [panting]
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 We've gotta cross the river.
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 Now, I think we can wade to the sandbank there.
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 And then swim the short distance to the other side.
ZOE TO JACK	 We're gonna swim an African river?
ZOE TO JACK	 Fuck that. There are crocodiles. [hyenas whining]
NOAH TO ALL	 Hyenas. Have they been tracking us?
NOAH TO JACK	 What are we gonna do?
JACK TO ALL	 Okay.
JACK TO ALL	 Let's follow the edge of the river.
JACK TO ALL	 Don't get too close to it. Okay? [hyenas whining]
ZOE	 Shit.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Okay. Stay low. Come on.
JACK TO LAUREN	 There you go, baby.
NOAH TO JACK	 Are you okay, Dad?
JACK TO NOAH	 Yeah, I'm okay.
JACK TO LAUREN	 [grunts] There you go, baby.
ZOE TO ALL	 Okay, we're good. Let's go. Let's go.
JACK TO NOAH	 I'm fine. I'm fine.
JACK	 [grunts]
ZOE TO JACK	 Let me help.
JACK TO ZOE	 No. It's okay, baby. I got it.
ZOE TO JACK	 Dad…
ZOE TO JACK	 let me help. I've got this.
ZOE TO JACK	 Let me help. Okay. Okay?

ZOE TO NOAH	 Yeah. [hyenas whining]
NOAH TO ZOE	 Zoe, Zoe, Zoe, go first.
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad, they're coming.
JACK TO NOAH	 I know, I know. I see it.
ZOE TO NOAH	 I got it. I got it.
NOAH TO ZOE	 Shit.
JACK TO ALL	 Oh my God. Come here. [hyenas whining]
NOAH TO ALL	 What do we do?
JACK TO NOAH	 Shh. [hyenas whining] [rapid gunshots]
ALL	 Hey! Hey!
ZOE TO MITCH	 Down here. Over here.
JACK TO MITCH	 Down here.
JACK	 Oh, my God.
JACK TO MITCH	 My god, I can't tell you how happy I am to see you.

MAN 1 TO WOMAN	 Stay right there. I'm-- I'm getting some help.
MAN 1 TO ALL	 Help! Help! Come fast.

MAN 1 TO MAN 2	 Blood everywhere.
LUCAS	 [indistinct]
MAN 1 TO MAN 2	 We must get him help quicks.
MAN 1 TO MAN 2	 Slowly. Be careful.
MAN 1 TO MAN 2	 I'll hold him.
BILLY TO ALL	 I think it was somewhere around here.
BILLY TO ALL	 I don't know, we went off road.
BILLY TO ALL	 I wasn't paying attention.
LUCAS TO BILLY	 That's impossible.
LUCAS TO BILLY	 I mean, all the vehicles in the park are accounted for.
BILLY TO LUCAS	 No, we drove through without paying
BILLY TO LUCAS	 and never checked in.
DOCTOR TO LUCAS	 Okay. We need to move him out.
WOMAN	 Get everybody ready.
WOMAN	 We're going out. [insects chirping]
MAN 1	 [panting]

MITCH TO JACK	 Yeah, it's not a problem.
MITCH TO JACK	 You guys will be fine.
MITCH TO JACK	 What were you doing out there?

JACK	 [grunts]
MITCH TO JACK	 It's fine. You're all okay.
MITCH TO JACK	 Put him…put him by the fire.
JACK	 [groans]
MITCH TO JACK	 By the fire.
MITCH TO JACK	 You guys will be fine now.

MITCH TO JACK	 There we go.
JACK TO MITCH	 [grunts] Thank you.
MAN 2	 [speaking in foreign language]
JACK TO LAUREN	 Baby. [indistinct].
MITCH TO JACK	 What is going on with her?
JACK TO MITCH	 She's diabetic. She needs insulin.
MITCH TO JACK	 Insulin? We don't have insulin.
MITCH TO JACK	 The nearest medical center is two hours away.
JACK TO MITCH	 Can you call for help? She's dying.
MITCH TO JACK	 How long does she have?
JACK TO MITCH	 Not long. Please call someone.
JACK TO MITCH	 Call anyone.

MITCH TO JACK	 See if we can get a signal.
JACK TO MITCH	 Thank you.
MITCH TO JACK	 It's okay.
MITCH TO JACK	 Getting a signal here.
MITCH TO JACK	 I'm trying to get a signal.
MITCH TO JACK	 These things are always supposed to have a signal.
MITCH TO SELF	 Come on.
MITCH TO SELF	 Why is there no signal?
MITCH TO JACK	 This is crazy.
MITCH TO JACK	 Sat phones are always supposed to give you a signal here.
MITCH TO JACK	 Hold on.
CHARLIE TO ZOE	 I wish you hadn't seen that.
JACK TO CHARLIE	 Seen what?
JACK TO ZOE	 Zoe, what's going on?
ZOE TO JACK	 They're poachers, Dad.
JACK TO ZOE	 What?
ZOE TO JACK	 They're poachers.
MITCH TO ZOE	 No, no, no. Ssshhh. No, no, no.
MITCH TO ZOE	 We do not like to use… the P-word.
MITCH TO JACK	 It's like I said back at the airport,
MITCH TO JACK	 when we first met.
MITCH TO JACK	 We help indigenous people
MITCH TO JACK	 make the best use of their resources.
ZOE TO MITCH	 By butchering wildlife?
JACK TO MITCH	 Right now…I--I don't care what you do.
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad, they killed that--
JACK TO NOAH	 Stop, Noah. No, no, stop. Okay?
JACK TO MITCH	 It's none of our business.
JACK TO MITCH	 We…we just need your help.
ZOE TO JACK	 Oh my God, they aren't gonna help us.
ZOE TO MITCH	 Who are you?
MITCH TO ZOE	 No.
CHARLIE TO MITCH	 [speaks foreign language]
MITCH TO CHARLIE	 Tie them up. [insects chirping]
JACK	 [grunts]
JACK	 [sighs]
ZOE TO MITCH	 Hey, asshole.
ZOE TO MITCH	 Yeah, you.
MITCH	 [laughs]
ZOE TO MITCH	 You know how many rhino are left?
CHARLIE TO ZOE	 Enough to make them valuable?
MITCH TO ZOE	 Valuable enough for these men to earn
MITCH TO ZOE	 more in one night than they would the whole year.
MITCH TO ZOE	 Enough to feed their families.
ZOE TO MITCH	 You're disgusting.
MITCH TO ALL	 [speaking in foreign language]
MITCH TO ZOE	 Do you think their children should starve?
ZOE TO MITCH	 No, I don't think their children should starve.
MITCH TO ZOE	 Well, so then we… we agree.
MITCH TO ZOE	 That they have the right to benefit from their own land.
MITCH TO ZOE	 From their own heritage.
MITCH TO ZOE	 What gives you the right?
MITCH TO ZOE	 Some privileged, ignorant, white--
ZOE TO MITCH	 [spits] Fuck off.
MITCH TO ZOE	 [speaks foreign language]
ZOE TO MITCH	 Fuck off.
MITCH TO ZOE	 [speaks foreign language]
MITCH TO ZOE	 to dictate anything these people do.
ZOE TO JACK	 Dad?
JACK TO MITCH	 I'm sure that you're making a healthy profit
JACK TO MITCH	 out of them.
ZOE TO MITCH	 Fuck off.
CHARLIE TO JACK	 Let's just call capitalism, my friend.
CHARLIE TO JACK	 You--you work in the oil business, right?
MITCH TO JACK	 Charlie's right. Charlie is absolutely right.
MITCH TO JACK	 Oil man, you're not allowed to get
MITCH TO JACK	 all holier than thou with us.
MITCH TO JACK	 I mean, what--what is the worst that we do?
CHARLIE TO JACK	 Yeah.
MITCH TO ALL	 A few less rhinos in the world.
MITCH TO ALL	 Maybe an elephant?
MITCH TO ALL	 A pangolin.
MITCH TO JACK	 You know how much this is worth?
MITCH TO JACK	 It's worth more than its weight in gold.
MITCH	 [sighs]
MITCH TO JACK	 And we're nothing compared to you.
MITCH TO JACK	 Don't even compare.
MITCH TO ZOE	 We're amateurs.
MITCH TO ZOE	 You're planet killers.
MITCH TO ZOE	 I gotta admit, that's pretty impressive.
NOAH TO MITCH	 What do you… what are you gonna do to us?
MITCH TO ALL	 Well, the end of your story… is easy.
MITCH TO ALL	 Obviously, Mom's about to die. So that's easy.
MITCH TO ALL	 As for the rest of you, we are going to move out.
MITCH TO ALL	 We usually let the hyenas clean up after us,
MITCH TO ALL	 though they prefer their animals injured,
MITCH TO ALL	 so might let my men go to work on you for a little bit.
MITCH TO ALL	 Though it looks like…
MITCH TO ALL	 Dad is already a little injured there.
JACK TO MITCH	 [grunting] Stop, please.
NOAH TO MITCH	 No. Stop! Stop.
JACK	 [groans]
NOAH TO MITCH	 Stop it!
JACK	 [groans]
MITCH TO ALL	 The rest is easy.
MITCH TO ALL	 Arrogant American family comes to Africa.
MITCH TO ALL	 Africa embraces arrogant American family.
MITCH TO MEN	 Gentlemen, sorry to keep you waiting.
MITCH TO MEN	 Sorry about that. Great to see you again.
MITCH TO JIN	 Jin. Always a pleasure.
MITCH TO JIN	 Thanks for coming out.
MITCH TO MEN	 Sorry about the whole blindfold and-- [conversation continues in background]
NOAH TO ZOE	 She's gonna die.
ZOE TO NOAH	 Don't say that.
NOAH TO ZOE	 She is.
JACK TO NOAH AND ZOE	 No, she is, if we don't get out of here.
NOAH TO ZOE	 What's gonna happen to us?
ZOE TO NOAH	 You heard him.
ZOE TO NOAH	 They're gonna kill us.
JACK TO ZOE	 No, no, they're not. They're not. They're just--
ZOE TO JACK	 Oh my God. Of course, they fucking are.
ZOE TO JACK	 Jesus, Dad.
JACK TO ZOE	 I was just…
JACK TO ZOE	 I'm just trying to stay positive. Okay?
NOAH TO JACK	 Why don't you just tell us something truthful?
JACK TO NOAH	 I'm sorry. That's the truth.
ZOE TO JACK	 No, Dad. You don't…
ZOE TO JACK	 Forget it. You don't have to do that now.
JACK TO ZOE	 It's okay.
ZOE TO JACK	 Please. I--
JACK TO ZOE	 No, no. Now is the-- now is the perfect time.
ZOE TO JACK	 No.
JACK TO ZOE	 We might not have any time left.
ZOE	 [sobs]
JACK	 [sighs]
JACK TO ZOE	 I'm sorry I haven't been a very good father.
JACK TO ZOE	 I'm sorry that I couldn't see what was important
JACK TO ZOE	 until everything was falling apart around me.
JACK TO ZOE	 It's okay. It's okay.
JACK TO ZOE	 I love your mother. And I love you both so much.
JACK TO ZOE	 And I know, I know I didn't say that enough.
JACK TO NOAH	 And Noah…
JACK TO NOAH	 I just wanted you to be happy, bud.
JACK TO NOAH	 Yeah.
ZOE	 [cries]
JACK TO NOAH	 You are who you are,
JACK TO NOAH	 so fucking what to everything else, right?
JACK TO NOAH	 Hey…
JACK TO NOAH	 I'm so proud of you.
JACK TO NOAH	 And I love you so much.
JACK TO ZOE	 Zoe, I love you too.
JACK TO ZOE	 I've loved you from the moment I met you and your mother.
ZOE	 [cries]
JACK TO ZOE	 You're my daughter, and I'm your father.
JACK TO ZOE	 Even…even if you say I'm not.
JACK TO ZOE	 You'll still be my daughter, okay?
ZOE	 [indistinct mutter]
JACK TO ZOE	 Yeah. I'm so proud of you.
JACK TO ZOE	 And I only push college because…
JACK TO ZOE	 because you are so damn smart.
JACK TO ZOE	 And I can see the woman,
JACK TO ZOE	 the beautiful woman that you are becoming.
JACK TO ZOE	 And the world needs people like that.
JACK TO ZOE	 Great people who change things for the better.
JACK TO ZOE	 Not people like me, huh.
JACK TO ZOE	 Money and selfishness.
JACK TO ZOE	 It's nothing. The world is not about stuff.
JACK TO ZOE	 It is about family. It is about this.
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 And I am…
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 I am proud of you both
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 because you are nothing like me.
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 And I fucked things up
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 pretty badly but not…
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 not this time.
MITCH TO MEN	 I was thinking…
NOAH	 [groans]

JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 Right over there?
NOAH TO JACK	 Yeah.
JACK TO NOAH	 Yeah, good. Noah, I need you to be strong
JACK TO NOAH	 and I mean properly strong, okay.
JACK TO NOAH	 You've gotta carry your mother.
JACK TO ZOE	 Zoe, you gotta drive that jeep, baby.
ZOE TO JACK	 No. Why--why can't you drive?
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 Somebody needs to distract them.
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 That's me. Now, listen.
NOAH TO JACK	 Dad.
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 Listen, listen. Look.
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 Listen, I love you both… very much.
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 You are my everything.
JACK TO ZOE AND NOAH	 You'll know.
NOAH	 [cries]
