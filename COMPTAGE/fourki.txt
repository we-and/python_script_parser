("FOUR KIDS AND IT")
(REEL 1A/1B)




FEMALE BOOKSHOP	You just haven’t found your story yet. What’s this one about ? (Hum)

ROS	(Oh), kids, magic.

FEMALE BOOKSHOP	Wishes that cause trouble.

ROS	Sounds a bit young.

FEMALE BOOKSHOP	No-one’s too old for wishes.

DAVID	Let’s go, monkey.

FEMALE BOOKSHOP	No, no. No charge.

ROS	Thank you. Is that gel in your hair ?

DAVID	Come on, we’re in a rush. Why ?

ROS	It looks weird.

DAVID	How weird ?

ROS	Really weird.

ALICE	There you are. You are coming with me, young lady.

SMASH	I’m busy.

ALICE	Busy ? This is not busy.

SMASH	I’m making friends. You said I should make friends, right ?

ALICE	Friends ? This is not what a friend looks like. This, this is a mug shot on the six o’clock news. You’re lucky I don’t call the cops.

SMASH	Go ahead. Any luck, I’ll get deported.

DAVID	Robbie. I thought I asked you to pack. What good is that ? What are you thinking about wearing for underpants ? Because those games cartridges are not gonna supply adequate coverage. Come on, bit of action, please !

ALICE	I  just don’t know what’s wrong with you, Smash. I’ve got a good mind not to take on this vacation at all.

SMASH	So, don’t take me somewhere good. Like back home.

ALICE	We are home !

SMASH	This sucky little country ?  Have you seen what they eat ? Mushy peas. They eat mushy peas, mom. And they drive on the left ! Oh my gosh, you almost killed us !

DAVID	You’re gonna absolutely love this place guys, I promise.

ROS	Is there a phone signal ?

DAVID	I hope not. Imagine that, Robbie, all that peace and tranquillity, romping in the dunes. And there’s, er, there’s a bit of a surprise.

ROBBIE	Is there wifi ?

DAVID	No, there’s no wifi.

ROBBIE	Is that the surprise ?

DAVID	No.

ROBBIE	It isn’t a very good surprise.

DAVID	Well, its not the surprise.

ROS	What if mum wants to phone us ? What if she’s having a crisis ?

DAVID	Mummy’s a big girl, she can look after herself. Robbie, if you play that thing all the way you’re gonna be sick.

SMASH	See ? I’ve been packed for weeks.

ALICE	I did mention we’re going to the British coast, right ?

SMASH	You are, maybe. This is my luggage for the Seychelles, where I’m moving. Soon as dad makes the call.

ALICE	Smash. Smash, I don’t think your dad is…

MAUDIE	Smash !

SMASH	Hey ! Maudie ! You wanna fly ?

MAUDIE	Yeah ! Fly !

ROS	What is this ?

DAVID	This is, er… it’s just some sounds I’m getting in to. Some new ones. Yeah, they’re, they’re, er… they’re quite cool, these guys actually. They’re, um… er, a band.

ROS	What d’you think the surprise is gonna be ?

ROBBIE	Nothing good.

ROS	What if it’s mum ? What if they’re getting back together ? it’d be like before.

ROBBIE	Long silences and emotional repression ?

ROS	Before that, when if was all alright.

SMASH	There’s white sand beaches in the Seychelles. And flamingos.

ALICE	And probably tension, and civil unrest.

SMACH	There’s no unrest in the Seychelles.

ALICE	Your father’s there, give’em time.

SMASH	What is this ? Oh, no, you have got to be kidding me ?

ALICE	What ? I can cook. Well, I’m a mom, aren’t I ? Moms are supposed to cook.

MAUDIE	I don’t wanna get poisoned.

SMASH	You can’t cook !

ALICE	You’ll see.

SMASH	You can’t cook !

DAVID	So… what do you think ?

ROBBIE	I feel sick.

DAVID	Just keep calm, deep breaths. In. Out through the mouth.

ROBBIE	It’s coming out.

DAVID	Well, try to keep it in. There you go, darling.

ROS	Thanks.

DAVID	Deep breaths.

ROS	Mum !

SMASH	Who are they ?

ALICE	Let’s go inside.Er, Maudie, Smash, this is David.

DAVID	Guys, I’d like you to, er, meet Alice. You should know your mum talks about you girls all the time.

SMASH	What a coincidence. She doesn’t talk about you at all.

ROS	Whey are you holding hands ?

DAVID	Well, um…

ALICE	We have something to tell you.

ROBBIE	I feel sick.

ALICE	Ros, Robbie. Your dad and I, well, um…

DAVID	We’ve been, well, we’ve been, um…

ALICE	We’ve been seeing each other.

SMASH	That is revolting !

ALICE	Hey Smash !

MAUDIE	Can we go home, please ?

ROS	Wait, when you say “seeing each other” you mean seeing each other ?

DAVID	Look, this holiday’s a geat opportunity for everyone to get to knows each other. Come on. What d’you say ?

SMASH	Great going Mom. You ruined my life. Again. I’m going to my room.

ALICE	Okay. Well, let’s go outside.

ROS	But, but what about mum ?

DAVID	Ros, mum’s not…

ROS	Hey ! That’s my room ! I was here first !

SMASH	Are you kidding me, it’s my room !

ROS	I said get out ! Stop it !

SMASH	It’s my room now !

ROS	I was here first !

SMASH	Stop it, go away !

ROS	It’s my room !

SMASH	This is my half. Sty out. Who bring books on a holiday ?

ROS	People who can read.

SMASH	People with no lives. Look at these losers.

ROS	Get off that.

DAVID	Hey. Look, we’re gonna make it work, for all of them.

ALICE	Yes we are. Is that ?

DAVID	Yes.

SMASH	Get off of me !

ROS	You get off of me !

SMASH	Stop it !

DAVID	Hey, hey, both of you, calm down.

SMASH	She started it !

ROS	She started it !

ALICE	Smash, you’re just impossible.

SMASH	I don’t wanna be here !

ROS	I don’t want to be here !

DAVID	Right ! I have an idea, why don’t we all go for a picnic ?

SMASH	This place is gross.

ALICE	Smash, try to be nice.

SMASH	How ? There’s all this gross stuff on my shoe.

DAVID	Tell you what, why don’t we play a game ? I spy with my little eye, something beginning with W.

MAUDIE	Weirdo.

ALICE	Oh, Maudie, David is not a weirdo.

TRISTAN	Hello ! You must be the new tenants over at the cottage.

DAVID	You must be Mr Trent from the um…

TRISTAN	The mansion ? Yes, that’s right, I live in a mansion. This is all part of my estate.

ALICE	This Is, um, quite some back yard you got here.

TRISTAN	Er, I’m sorry I, I can’t quite understand what you’re saying.

DAVID	Oh ! Alice is American.

TRISTAN	You’re an American. For a moment I thought you had a speech impediment. And you’ve got… four children ! You have been busy, haven’t you ?

DAVID	Oh no. They’re not all of our, no, we’re still getting to know each other.

SMASH	As if we have a choice.

ALICE	Smash, please.

DAVID	And this is, er, Alice’s daughter.

TRISTAN	Oh and for some reason you’ve called her Smash. How delightful who’s the rest of the crew ? Crash, Band and Wallop ? Oh my… well, that is extraordinary. You. You, don’t move. Brilliant. And one of the rest of you. Well, better be getting back to the old, er, mansion. Do let me know if you need er…

DAVID	Anything ?

TRISTAN	Yeah. That would go there as a noun, wouldn’t it ? Anything. Any thing. Anything.

DAVID	He seems like a very interesting fellow. Shall we ? W. Anyone ?

SMASH	Water ?

DAVID	Very good.

ROS	Why do you call her Smash ?

ALICE	Her real name’s Samantha. Excuse me.

SMASH	Hey.

ROBBIE	Hey ! Give it back !

SMASH	You want it…

ALICE	Smash.

ROS	Hey ! Give that back now, Samantha !

SMASH	Don’t call me that.

ROBBIE	Give me that back ! Give it back !

ROS	Smash ?

ROBBIE	Smash ?

ROS	Smash, are you alright ?! Smash ?

SMASH	It’s a tunnel.

ROBBIE	Where does it go ?

SMASH	Away from you.

ROS	We should tell someone. She, she might get hurt.

ROBBIE	She’s got my game.

ROS	Robbie ! Robbie, come back !

MAUDIE	Wait for me !

ROS	Maudie, no, come back. Maudie ! Maudie ! Maudie ! Maudie, come back !

ROBBIE	Give it !

SMASH	Oh, poor little Robbie.

ROBBIE	Give it !

SMASH	You’re good at getting things. See I’m putting it, it’s right in front of you.

ROS	Robbie, be careful, just… It’s dangerous !

SMASH	You wanna see dangerous ?

ROS	Smash, come down ! You’re frightening Maudie !

SMASH	Hey Robbie Hood, fetch.

ROS	Smash !

SMASH	Come on, kid, what you scared of ?

MAUDIE	Fairy ? It’s got my shoe ! It’s got my shoe ! It’s got my shoe !

ROS	Run, Maudie, run to the rocks ! Maudie, come here, come here, come here !

ROBBIE	No !

SMASH	Here.

ROBBIE	It’s coming ! What ?!

ROS	I can hit it ! Shall I hit it ?

PSAMMEAD	No ! Hit her, she’s hurting me !

SMASH	Did it just speak ?

PSAMMEAD	Speak ? That was angry southing. If, if I was gonna speak I would have said something like “Oh ! What’s that ?!” Fine, you got me. What do you want.

SMASH	My sister’s shoe.

PSAMMEAD	I don’t know what you’re talking about.

SMASH	You stole it right off her foot.

PSAMMEAD	Anything that touches this beach is an offering to the Psammead.

ROS	Psammead ?

PSAMMEAD	Yes, hello. I’ll take most offerings, er, I’m not fussy.

ROS	I know this. This is from my book, Five Children and it. The kids, they find this thing and it gives, them wishes.

PSAMMEAD	One a day, but nothing longer than a sentence. But you don’t want a wish they never work out. There’s consequences. Something unfortunate happens, you blame me, I get a bad name. Wishes are bad news.

ROBBIE	I wish I was the best climber in the world.

SMASH	Was that it ?

PSAMMEAD	What  do you mean, “was that it” ? I nearly burst !

SMASH	So, we make a wish and you, what, make a fart ?

PSAMMEAD	Magic isn’t all twinkly lights and stardust, you know. Some of us have to work with enchanted stomach gasses. Now, if you’ll excuse me.

ROS	Wait ! Don’t go !

SMASH	Oh yeah, we wanna wish for more farts.

PSAMMEAD	I’m sorry, did I make the granting of your heart’s desire look easy ? Because it isn’t ! It’s extremely tiring !

MAUDIE	And stinky.

PSAMMEAD	Mmm? If you want a dead Psammead on your hands, go ahead, ask for two wishes. Until then, one a day is the best I can do. Come back tomorrow, if you survive this one.

MAUDIE	I want my fairy !

ROBBIE	Look, it works !

ROS	Robbie, be careful !

SMASH	Hey ! Whoa ! Robbie !

ROS	These wishes they can… there’s a catch, I know there is.

SMASH	Higher ! Faster !

DAVID	Maybe we should go and look for them.

ALICE	Maybe we should stay here and…

DAVID	No, I think we should look for them.

ALICE	I guess that would be the responsible thing to do. Oh, got bars. Wait one second. Hello ? No, it’s fine. Shoot. What ? Hello ?

DAVID	Hey, Ros, you enjoying the sea air ?

ROS	Can’t talk. Book.

DAVID	Well, it’s nice to see you running about a bit.

ROS	Robbie ! Robbie, get down ! The wish ends at senset !

SMASH	Faster ! Higher ! More dangerous ! Robbie, hang on !

ROS	Grab the rope !

ROBBIE	Oh my Switch !

SMASH	Come on, Maudie. Are you okay ?

ROBBIE	Yeah, my game’s okay.

DAIVD	Oh for goodness sake. Get your heard out of that screen, Robbie. Bit of exercise ! Come on.

SMASH	You’d think that he’d mention, “Oh and by the way, the magic wears off at sunset.”

MAUDIE	There’s dribble on my fairy !

SMASH	Oh.

ROS	That was pretty amazing today, right ? I mean, wishes, real wishes. Have you thought about what you might…

SMASH	No.

ROS	Fine. You’re not the only one with a phone.

SMASH	You call that a phone ? My dad.! Just like my life’ll be when he takes me away from all of this. Yes ! I got a bar !

ROS	Look, I can make films with it.

JENNY	Here you go.

ROS	Let me get you two together. Do a kiss.

DAVID	Let’s see what else that thing does, shall we ?

SMASH	Okay. Hi. Dad ! I’m sorry, I can’t take your call right now. Please leave our message after the tone and I’ll get back to you as soon as I…

PSAMMEAD	Looking for someone ?

SMASH	Hey, don’t pelt me with sea barf.

PSAMMEAD	Sorry, it’s a reflex.

SMASH	To what ?

PSAMMEAD	To foolish children in search of ill advised wishes.

SMASH	The I got great news for you, Sammy. Cos this is the best wish you’ve ever heard.

ROS	Mum ?

SMASH	Ros, I want you to bring Maudie, I don’t want her to miss this.

ROS	Miss what ?

SMASH	You’ll find out. I’m sending someone to pick you up.

ROS	Where from ? Um, Smash said she’s gone out for a nature walk.

ALICE	What did she really say ?

ROS	Er, that she hates all of us and we should just butt’ out of her life’.

ALICE	That sounds like my daughter. No whisk, so, um… soop ? Okay

ROS	Anyway, we were just wondering if maybe we could join her ?

ALICE	That’s a funny way of butting out of her life.

ROS	Well, just trying to make an effort.

DAVID	Oh good for you, Ros, making new friends, that’s nice. Oh my hand !

ALICE	Oh, are you okay ?

DAVID	Yes, yes, no !

ROS	Okay? We gotta go.

MAUDIE	Has Smash run away again ?

ROS	No, she just wants us to take you to her.

MAUDIE	Am I running away too ?

ROS	No-one’s running away. She’s made a wish, that’s all. She got up early and made a wish, without telling us.

MAUDIE	What wish ?

ROS	I don’t know.

ROBBIE	Maybe she wished to be invisible. Invisible woul be cool.

ROS	Huh. Yeah, I don’t think she wished to be invisible. Maudie ! Robbie ! Wait ! Wait ! Come back ! Maudie ! Where are we going ? Put your seatbelt on ! No.

NAOMI	Robbie. Maudie. The other one. Coco’s waiting inside. Follow me.

ROBBIE	Who’s Coco ?

ROS	That’s Coco Rayne.

COCO	Want it shorter there, longer here. A lot more feathers. And you, add a cape. Ah, you made it ! Not long to go now. You must be so excited !

ROS	Confused, mostly. Where’s Smash ?

COCO	Come with me, I’ll take you to her. No, of course, none of this is any surprise to me. I knew she had it the moment I first saw her.

SMASH	Hey, Maudie ! Big sis is a star ! What do you think ?

NAOMI	Come on, let’s get you into make-up, Maudie.

COCO	The new video has got two billion views, Smash, you are the hottest act on the planet.

ROS	What about us ?

SMASH	There’s some super fans who won a competition go stand by them.

COCO	Hey, excuse me.

MALE PHOTOG.	Yeah ?

COCO	Girls, take a photo. Take a photo. Nice. Alright, let’s go talk to the media.

SMASH	Okay.

COCO	Okay, don’t forget to  talk about your fragrance, okay ? This is forever, Smash.

ROS	You could have at least told us before you just ran off…

SMASH	Somebody throw a sheet over that.

DAVID	Robbie !

ALICE	Smash ? Maudie ?

DAVID	Ros ?

TRISTAN	Yes, where is you rmysterious daughter ? What’s she up to, eh ?

DAVID	Mr Trent ?

TRISTAN	Oh ! Hello ! Well, fancy seeing you here. On this, er, craggy pathway.

ALICE	What are you doing ?

TRISTAN	Oh, what, on the…with the and the… I just, er, nature survey, actually. Um, just studying the fauna and flora of the area. Oh, there’s a bee.

DAVID	You haven’t seen our children, have you ? They seem to have disappeared.

ALICE	They haven’t disappeared… we just don’t know where they’ve gone.

DAVID	Which is pretty much the same thing. I knew we shouldn’t let them wander off.

ALICE	Oh David, they’re children. You gotta give ‘em some freedom.

DAVID	Well, I do give them freedom, I just tend to be with them at the time. Which…

TRISTAN	D’you know what, they’re gonna be fine. I grew up here myself, and I was forever darting off into these moors in pursuit of some creature or another. Oh, to be young again and innocently pulling the wings off some natural creation. Here’s a thought. Why don’t you and your family come over to the mansion tomorrow ? We could all spend some time together, h…have a little drinky. Might be rather fun.

ALICE	Oh no, we wouldn’t wanna impose.

TRISTAN	It’s not an imposition ! I insist ! I’d love it. I was never blessed with children myself and I think you can learn so much from them, can’t you ?

DAVID	Well, that’s very… very, very kind of you. Thank you.

TRISTAN	So, you’ll come ? I’ll put it in the pad. Tomorrow.

		(Four kids and it)

AUDIENCE	Smach ! Smash ! Smash ! Smash ! Smash !

MALE LIGH.TECH.	Okay, somebody, can we get a green filter on that ? Thank you.

ROS	Um, hello ? Smash, maybe we can stop to talk about how all you…

SMASH	Let’s go. Go, go, go !

ROS	Smash !

SMASH	Who wants to party ?! I said who wants to party ?! This show’s for my sister, Maudie ! Let’s Smash it, everyone ! (Sing) Watch the way that I dance fast for you, for you. I know I’m destined for stardom. I’m Smash, turn the lights off for you. For you ! That’s right. I gotta feeling, gotta feeling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ! Feet off the floor, I’m on the ceiling, yeah, yeah. Got my wish and I believe it. It’s gonna be good, so good. Watch me dance I never lose ma balance. Moon walking into every… What ? What happened ?

ROS	Sunset.

SMASH	No, no, no, but it hardly started. No, I want them back.

M.SECURITY GUARD	Oi ! How did you get in here ?

ROS	Run ! Run !

SMASH	This is trash ! I want it back ! I want it, I want it all back !

ROBBIE	You can’t. You have it for a while, then it’s gone. That’s the way it is.

ROS	We’re gonna be in so much trouble.

ALICE	The are going to be in so much trouble.

DAVID	I thought we should give them some freedom ?

FEMALE ANNOUN.	Passengers are reminded to keep your luggage with you at all times.

ROS	Sorry. Come on, Maudie.

SMASH	You’re so slow !

ROS	Smash, have you got any idea how we’re going to get home ?

SMASH	Hurry up.

ROS	Wait !

MALE ANNOUN.	The train service to Penzance is now standing at platform eight. Calling at Reading, Bristol Parkway…

SMASH	Ros, hurry up !

MALE ANNOUN.	…Taunton, Exeter…

ROS	We don’t have tickets.

SMASH	Just act natural ! Just go on.

ROS	Shut the door.

SMASH	We used to do this all the time back home. But the bathrooms are much bigger there.

ROBBIE	Americans have bigger butts.

DAVID	Two girls, both thirteen years old. A boy, nine, probably with his hood up and a five year old girl.

SERGEANT GASC.	You sure they’re not on a nature ramble ?

DAVID	At night ? No.

SERGEANT GASC.	Well, there’s a lot to see at night. Badgers, owls.

ALICE	What ? David, why is he asking about owls ?

DAVID	They’re not looking at owls.

SERGEANT GASC.	Are you sure ? Fascinating creatures. Okay.

DAVID	It’s gonna be okay.

SERGEANT GASC.	Now, this is a tawny owl.

DAIVD	I don’t… I don’t want to looks at owls. I want you to find our children, please.

SERGEANT GASC.	You tried ringing them ?

DAVID	Mmm. But there’s no signal.

SERGEANT GASC.	There’s one up that ladder.

SMASH	I make a crash, in a flash, I’m… forgetting it. It’s my turne on the seat, move.

ROS	You know, none of us chose this, Smash. We could at least try to get along.

SMASH	Not me. I’m gonna go live with my dad in the Seychelles.

ROS	Yeah, and what about your mum ?

SMASH	She won’t even notice. All she cares about’s her dumb job.

ROS	It’s your mum ! What are you gona tell her ?

SMASH	That it’s your fault.

ROS	Hi ! Hi, Alice, it’s Ros.

ALICE	Ros, where are you ? Are Maudie and Smash with you ?

ROS	Um, yes, um, Smash’s hand got stung by a bee and it swelled up and we got taken to hospital.

ALICE	What ? Hospital ? Wait, how’d you get to the hospital ?

ROS	No, we’re fine, we’re fine. Um, they gave her an injection and we’re just waiting for the swelling to go down. Occupied. That was Smash, yeac.

DAVID	Which hospital ? We’ll come and get you.

ROS	Um, the, they’re gonna put us on a train. You can pick us up from the station.

ALICE	A train ? Hasn’t his country heard of an ambulance before ?

SMASH	Where’s your mom ?

ROS	She’s at university.

SMASH	Oh, your dad cheated on her ?

ROS	No, of course not. She just wanted to find herself.

SMASH	Find herself a long way from you.

ROS	Is that why your dad left you ?

SMASH	No. He just got fed up with my mom, just like everyone else does.

MAUDIE	Daddy’s gone to live with a new lady. She reeled hm in with her tight, twenty year old tushy.

FEMALE ANNOUN.	We’re now approaching St Austell. St Austell will be our next stop.

ROBBIE	Er, I think this is our stop.

FEMALE TICKET INSP.	Tickets, now.

ALICE	Finally.

DAVID	Unbelievable.

ALICE	Totally unbelievable.

DAIVD	I just can’t get my head around it.

ALICE	I know. Totally out of control.

DAVID	Can’t believe that Ros and Robbie would ever do anything like that, it’s just not like them.

ALICE	Meaning what ? It’s all Smash’s fault ?

DAVID	Of course not. Although they’ve just never broken the law before.

ALICE	Well, you never let them out of your house, David. I mean, what are they gonna do, embezzle your rhubarb ?

DAVID	Let’s not argue.

ALICE	No, let’s argue. Come on, you have a problem with my parenting ? I wanna hear what you have to say.

DAVID	I, I don’t have a problem with your parenting. Although, obviously…  Er, Smash has her issues, but…

ALICE	Issues ?

DAVID	You said issues. You told me that she had issu… Let’s, let’s just, let’s just forget everything and just, and move on.

ALICE	No, no, no. Don’t do that, don’t try to smooth everything over. Tell me what you mean.

DAVID	I didn’t mean anything. I, I, I, I’m sorry I mentioned it.

ALICE	I don’t want apologies, David. I wanna know what you feel. What are you thinking ?

SMASH	Do it again. I want it again !

PSAMMEAD	I don’t do the same wish twice.

SMASH	What are, what are you doing ?

ROS	It’s my turn of a whish.

SMASH	Oh, great, and what lame-o thing are you gonna ask for ? World peace ?

PSAMMEAD	World peace ? Finally.

SMASH	No ! Maybe you should wish to be a famous writer.

ROS	Yourself up a brain.

SMASH	Maybe you should wish yourself up a boyfriend !

PSAMMEAD	Maybe I should wish for the sweet release of oblivion.

SMASH	What about two wishes today, Sammy ?

PSAMMEAD	Two wishes a day is extremely hazardous for me. If you want two wishes a day, I suggest you find one of the two wish a day Psammeads.

ROS	Where are they ?

PSAMMEAD	Extinct.

SMASH	Great, now you scared him off !

ROS	I scared him off ?!

SMASH	Yeah, you scared him off !

ROS	I did not scare him off !

SMASH	Hey ! Stop it !

ROS	I touched you !

SMASH	You pushed me !

DAVID	Good morning. D’you think maybe we could not, um… Can w put last night behind us ?

ALICE	That’s the problem, isn’t it ? Putting things behind us… pretending everything’s okay. I don’t know if it’s gonna work.

DAVID	What, because I said…

ALICE	It’s not what you said, it’s what you don’t say. I never know what you’re feeling because you’re, you’re always so damn, reasonable. You know, sometimes you just gotta let it rip.

DAVID	D’you think that might be too many raisins ?

ALICE	Yeah, maybe.

DAVID	Look, I, I promise… I will, I will try to be a lot more unreasonable. Okay ?

ALICE	Okay.

DAVID	Let’s give the kids another chance today, maybe they’ll calm down a bit.

ALICE	Yeah.

SMASH	You’re pushing me !

DAVID	Yeah.

ROS	Ow, stop, why are you kicking me ?

SMASH	I’m just trying to walk through the door.

ROS	So am I !

DAVID	This is it.

ROS	You just hit…

SMASH	I was walking.

ROS	Dad, she hit me. I swear there’s a bruise.

SMASH	Oh, sorry for walking.

ALICE	Smash, come on, please.

ROSE	There’s a bruise.

SMASH	Oh, there’s a bruise ?

ROS	Yes, there’s a bruise.

DAVID	Come on, girls, we gotta get…

TRISTAN	Welcome. Welcome to trente Towers. C-come in, come in.

DAVID	Well, this is charming.

TRISTAN	Oooh, er, I wonder if I might trouble you to remove your outdoor footwear.

DAVID	Of course.

TRISTAN	Would you mind ? Awffully ? Shoes. It’s just that it’s a heritage site. If you don’t mind ? Daddy shot that hippo. An incredible hump. Put up a real struggle, that beast. Just pop those there. So, er, what do you think ?

DAVID	It’s charming, yes, really, really charming.

ALICE	It’s old and kind of worn looking. I guess that’s a British thing, right ?

TRISTAN	Well, it’s not Disneyland, but we do our best. There was a time when the Trents, were kings of the world. My ancestors explored the globe, bravely uncovering lost civilisations and… liberating their primitive knick knacks. Great grandpops, he made his fortune. Blew it all on, well… let’s call it his final quest.

DAVID	A quest, really ? For, um, what ?

TRISTAN	Ultimate power. Riches beyond the dreams of man. The usual. It was an obsession that finally destroyed him… but which may yet have a positive outcome. Do you think I could perhaps offer you a cocktail ? And give the children a tour of the house ? Let’s er, leave the adults to their stuffy entertainment. I’ve got some things that I think you’ll find rather intriguing through here. Come this way, young lady. Through here. Now, this is an absolute gem… and it’s the only one like it in the world, what’s more. Now, look at some of these genuine marvels. Don’t mind the smell.

ROBBIE	Wow ! Look at all of this. What does this do ?

TRISTAN	Oh? No, no, no, no, no,no, we don’t touch that. That’s not for children…

ROBBIE	Cool !

TRISTAN	Is it ?

ROBBIE	Night vision goggles !

TRISTAN	Ah, yes, well, plainly I’m a keen badger enthusiast. And I like to keep a keen eye on the goings on of the badger. They’re fascinating creatures, the badgers. Do you know they eat their young ? If you’re interested. Ah, now, you’ll like this. This is the last living Dodo.

MAUDIE	It looks kinda dead.

TRISTAN	Formerly the last living Dodo. Don’t be pedantic, it’s not an appealing quality in a child. Er, come through this way.

SMASH	What’s this ?

TRISTAN	That’s from China. Let go, please. It’s a Tyrannosaur’s claw.

SMASH	Did your family shoot it, too ?

TRISTAN	No, but they, they did shoot the peasant that found it. Oh. Please, don’t touch that. Come on. Should be in a borstal. Now, I’ve got some real treats for you in here. A menagerie of wonderful beasts and creatures that we’ve painstakingly preserved… Oh ! There you are.

ROS	Oh… where’s the toilet ?

TRISTAN	The water closet is, er, it’s upstairs on the right.

ROS	Okay.

TRISTAN	Now, who would like to see a stuffed elephant ? Formerly endangered, they’re now obviously extinct. But there are some real treasures among them. Sadly, that’s a mother and a child.  Oh… hello there. Nothing of interest in there for a young person. Um, Ros, while I have you for a moment, coul I just ask, have you ever been here before ? Or had a relative from here ? A grandmother, perhaps ?

ROS	Um, no.

TRISTAN	Curious, um… since you’ve been here, have you come across anything unusual ? Any oddities ?

ROS	Um, other than you, you mean ?

TRISTAN	Well, listen, if you should see anything unusual, do let me know. I’d make it worth your while. For example.

ALICE	Hmm

DAVID	Mmm.

ALICE	Look at these ! Hey, I want to replace your mom. That’s pretty much how she sees me.

DAVID	No, no, it’s not. Maybe a little bit. Here, let me have a go. Smash, I am your step father.

ALICE	We’re so revolting.

DAVID	The force is strong on this one.

TRISTAN	Forgive me interrupting your ethnically insensitive erotica… but I think I’d rather like to get on witch my afternoon.

DAVID	Yes.

ALICE	Sorry about that.

DAVID	Sorry.

ROS	Where are the others ?

ALICE	We said they could go.

DAVID	Ros. Ros, we need to talk to you, darling.

TRISTAN	I’ll take that, thank you.

ALICE	I know Smash isn’t always easy. She has difficulty making friends. With girls, anyways.

ROS	So, she knows how to talk to boys ?

ALICE	The wrong sort of boys, yeah. Look, Ros… I just wanna say, I really care about your dad.

ROS	So do I.

ALICE	I know you do, honey. Your dad… he’s sweet. Even when I first crashed into him, he was just so… Has he told you this ? How we met ? I crashed into him with my car. He asked me for my number. I was like, can you believe this guy ? He’s hitting on me at a road traffic accident. Turns out it was for insurance but I wasn’t gonna let him get away whithout buying me coffee. And he wasn’t badly hurt. Although, his bike was wrecked. So, Ros… I guess what I wanna ask is… wait, you have bars ! Do you actually have bars ?

ROS	It’s my mum !

ALICE	I’ll let you guys be alone.

ROS	Mum, is that you ? It’s noisy.

JENNY	I’m at a party.

ROS	Seriously ?

JENNY	How are you doing out there with your father ? You getting on okay with Alice ?

ROS	You, you know about her ?

JENNY	Your dad’s got to move on, sweetheart.

ROS	Yeah, but, um, I was actually wondering… d’you think that maybe when you’ve finished with all the partying and the studying and stuff, you might… you might actually come home ?

JENNY	Oh, Ros, we’ve talked about this. Your dad’s a lovely man.

ROS	Yes, he is. He is a lovely man. Il knew you still liked him.

PSAMMEAD	What kind of maniac leaves a Spinosaurus claw on a beach ?

ROBBIE	It’s supposed to be a Tyrannosaur.

PSAMMEAD	Excuse me. I think I know a Spinosaurus claw when it stabs me. It’s a very particular kind of impalement.

ROBBIE	You’ve met dinosaurs ?

PSAMMEAD	Of course, I haven’t met dinosaurs ! I hid from dinosaurs or I wouldn’t have survived long enough to be pestered by you ! Now, the important thing about dinosaurs, is…

SMASH	Can we have our wish now ? It’s Maudie’s turn.

PSAMMEAD	Yeah, oh yeah, never mind about the incredible prehistoric anecdotes, “give us our wish.” What is it this time ?

MAUDIE	I wish we could all…

DAVID	Alright, well I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna alright, you j… I’ll check on Rossy.

ALICE	Can you hear me ?

DAVID	You alright, darling ? 

ROS²	Um, yeah, I’m just feeling a bit… light headed.

DAVID	Oh, you know… Alice is a really nice person. I think, you know, I think you’ll grow to like her. You just have to give her a chance, babe. Hey. What are you doing ?

ROS	Hugging trees, you know… love the wildlife.

DAVID	Well? Er, why don’t I… give it a hug with you ?

ROS	Oh yeah, sure, just…

DAVID	How am I doing ? Alright ?

ROS	Great. Yeah.

DAVID	You know, Ros, there’s something I, I want to ask you.

ROS	Really ?

DAVID	How would you feel if Alice… moved in ? With us ? All of us, living together like, well, like a new family. I mean, I, I know it’ll be a difficult transition in the beginning, but what do you think ? Hm ? Rozzy ? Rozzy ?

SMASH	Maudie !

ROBBIE	Ros ! Maudie wished we could fly ! How great is this ?

ROS	Dad wants us to live with Alice.

ROBBIE	thought so.

ROS	That’s all you can say ?

ROBBIE	It’s not like we can do anything to stop them.

SMASH	Dad !

ALICE	That’s Smash’s phone.

DAVID	What ?

ALICE	She got a test from her dad. There’s no room for her at the moment. Big surprise. “But how about I buy you some sneakers.” Some sneakers ?

DAVID	Wow.

ALICE	I tried not to let her get her hopes up.

DAVID	Hey !

ALICE	I really tried.

DAVID	This way, she stays with you, with us. It’s a good thing.

ALICE	Yeah, she’s gonna be so excited.

ROBBIE	Ros ! There’s something wrong with Smash. Come on.

ROS	Smash, stop it !

ROBBIE	I’m okay.

SMASH	Why don’t you just leave me alone ? Oh.

ROS	You could have killed yourself !

SMASH	So what ?! Who cares ? Even my dad doesn’t want me.

MAUDIE	We want you. Don’t we, Robbie ?

ROBBIE	Yeah, you’re alright.

DAVID	Ah, there you are. Just in time.

ALICE	Dinner’s ready ! There you go.

SMASH	Oh, you found it.

ALICE	We need to talk about that.

SMASH	I’ll save you the trouble. “That was so expensive. You’re so irresponsible. What’s wrong with you ? Why don’t you just disappear, huh ?” “Why don’t you just become someone else ?”

ALICE	Smash, no.

SMASH	I’m gonna give this the funeral it deserves.

ALICE	There’s cakes. I’ll get the cakes. Okay.

MAUDIE	I liked it when we could fly.

DAVID	Hey, you ran away earlier, darling. I think maybe we should talk about…

ROS	I talked to mum. She still likes you, you know.

MAUDIE	Fly !

ALICE	Maudie ?

ROS	Imagine if none of this happened. Imagine if your mum was with your dad, they loved each other… and they had enough time for you.

SMASH	That won’t happen. My mom and dad can’t even be on the same continent.

ROS	What if they could ? We could wish it. We could wish them together.

SMASH	Only for a day.

ROS	What if there’s a way to make the wish last forever ? It’s my turne tomorrow. I’ve got an idea.

DAVID	It’s over.

KIDS	Whats ?

DAVID	The holiday.

ALICE	We’ve been moving too fast asking you to adjust too quickly. It’s not fair.

DAVID	So, you can pack your bags and then we’ll go.

ROS	But, but you can’t !

SMASH	Pathetic. I thought you were committed.

DAVID	We are committed.

SMASH	You’re gonna let it slide just cos your kids act up a bit ? What d’you think we were gonna do ? Hold a jamboree ? We’re supposed to hate you, don’t you know anything ?

ALICE	Smash, it’s not that…

SMASH	I’m very disappointed in your attitude. Not you. But you. I thought you had guts.

DAVID	I’ve got guts.

ROS	Yeah, that’s right, Dad? You tell her. If you want something then you’re gonna take it. And if you wanna force your kids on some awful holiday then you’re damn well going to. We need to know our boundaries.

SMASH	You need to find a way through this cos I tell you, you let us win this one… the next time you try to put us together we’re gonna be burning down bus shelters.

ROBBIE	Yeah !

MAUDIE	You need to take a long hard look at yourselves.

ROS	Burning down bus shelters ?

SMASH	Okay, it was your boundaries thing. I was like, let’s go total delinguent.

ROS	Um, your mum said that you’ve had a lot of boyfriends.

SMASH	Did she ?!

ROS	I was just wondering how that whole ‘getting them to notice you’ thing works.

SMASH	Just run up and hit them on the arm.

ROS	Really ?

SMASH	Yeah ! Boys are the simplest thing in the world. Just don’t over think it. Oh and, er, do something about your hair. And curly hair helps too.

PSAMMEAD	You new type of children are just so demanding. The last ones were much more considerate.

ROS	Funny tiy sgiykd lebtuib tgel? Tgat’s wgi we want to meet the original children. The ones from E Nesbit’s book, Five Childrend and it.

SMASH	That’s your wish ? I thought you were gonna…

ROS	I just wanna ask them something.

PSAMMEAD	Time travel wishes are dangerous. Timelines change, people stop existing. There’s always consequences with time travel. Always.

ROS	I’m decided.

PSAMMEAD	Fine. Who cares about reality anyway ?

ROS	Wait. What if we wanna get back ?

PSAMMEAD	You see that shell ? Blow on that if you get into bother.

SMASH	Is it magic ?

PSAMMEAD	I don’t know one of’em is. Might be that one.

CYRIL	You’re a run-looking lot.

SMASH	Said the dude in fancy dress.

CYRIL	I beg your pardon ?

JANE	Do you speak English ?

ROS	She’s American. We’re from the future. The Psammead sent us back here to meet you.

ROBERT	Golly, that’s a cracking wish. Perhaps we should wish to go to your time.

SMASH	Not in that get up.

CYRIL	Says the girl in the scarecrow costume. I’m Cyril.

ROS	Ros. And this must be Robert, Jane, Anthea and the lamb. Listen, there was something we wanted to ask you. Is there a way to make a wish permanent ? There’s something I really want to ask for, but it has to last forever. Not just a day.

ROBERT	You mean you don’t know yet ?

ROS	Tell me.

ANTHEA	That’s simple, you just wish for something else. Something that can.

TRISTAN	Bloody poachers !

ROBERT	Scraper !

TRISTAN	Scrumpers ! I knew it ! I’ve bee keeping my eye on the… no, no, you’d… Caught ya, boy.

ROS	I didn’t steal anything !

TRISTAN	Don’t you dare, don’t you dare move your earlobe.

ROS	Get off of me ! Stop it ! Ow, let go. You’re hurting me !

TRISTAN	Empty your pockets. Let’s see your loot. Let’s see what you’ve stolen from me, what you have pilfered. Come on, what have you got in there ? Hop to it. Shell, yes. That’s no interest to me. What’s this now ? What sorcery is his ?! What are these infernal beasts trapped within here ? See how enraged they are !

ROS	They’re angry birds ?

TRISTAN	I’m not surprised. Trapped for all eternity in a prison.

ROS	Hey…

TRISTAN	What are ya ? A witch ? A sorcerer ? A necromancer ? A leprechaun ? A Frenchman ? Whatever it is you are, I’ll wager you’re highly collectable. A real treasure.

ROS	Please, I’m a girl. The Psammead brought us here.

TRISTAN	Psammead ? Well, who’s thi Psammead ?

ROS	I don’t know, it’s, it’s not a person. It’s just this thing that gives us wishes.

TRISTAN	Interesting. And where might I find this magical wish granting entity ? Tell me ! Tell me ! I shan’t be asking you again.

SMASH	You got that right !

ROBBIE	Ros ! Come on !

ROS	Robbie ! How did you…

ROBBIE	Smash got Cyril to go back and see the Psammead. And I wished for us to have superpowers ! I’ve got x-ray vision, so I can see through walls. That’s how we found you. Maudie’s telekinetic and Smash has super strength. And you’ve got…

ROS	Laser eyes. Cool !

ANTHEA	This is a wheeze !

ROS	We have to get out of there, right now. The Psammead’s in danger.

SMASH	Come on, this is fun.

ROS	You see that ? That’s Tristan’s great grandfather over there. Once he’s seen all this he’s going to spend the rest of his life hunting down the Psammead. That was his life’s quest and I just handed it to him. Our Tristan’s hunting him, too !

SMASH	Then I guess we ought to do something about that. Where’s the Psammead ?

ROBBIE	There !

PSAMMEAD	My offerings ! My offerings !

TRISTAN	Oh my gosh ! It’s true. The legend is true.

SMASH	Leave this to me. Smash power !

ROS	Smash !

SMASH	Ow ow !

ROS	That wish expiered about a hundred years ago.

SMASH	Maudie ! Stop ! Stop it !

ROS	Stop !

TRISTAN	Out of the way ! The creature’s mine !

ROS	Try and make us !

TRISTAN	Oh, okay then !

SMASH	Come on. Oh, run, Maudie ! Run !

PSAMMEAD	Oh this is really helping.

ROS	To the tunnel !

PSAMMEAD	My beautiful offerings ! Take me back !

SMASH	Didn’t we just rescue you ?

PSAMMEAD	Oh, well, that, that was rescuing, was it ? I’m sorry ! I, I thought you were trying to kill me.

SMASH	If you have a problem with our rescuing then maybe you should have magicked yourself, out of it !

PSAMMEAD	I can’t do magic on myself.

SMASH	Well, that sucks.

TRISTAN	Hey ! You ! I’m stuck !

ROS	We’ll tell the coastguard in a couple of days !

SMASH	Maybe a week !

ROS	I am really sorry about your beach.

PSAMMEAD	It’s not your fault.

ROS	Well, actually… you know that whole going back in time thing… may kind have been what made the Trents, obsessed with hunting you down.

PSAMMEAD	Oh? Oh I see. Gosh, you must feel so awful about that. Look, don’t worry. Seriously, I was thinking of moving on anyway.

ROS	Really ?

PSAMMEAD	No, not really ! I’ve lived on that beach for a hundred million years. It’s survived global floods, two ice ages and a comet which wiped out most of the life on earth. But apparently, it couldn’t survive you !

ROS	I’ll, I’ll make it up to you.

DAVID	Wow ! That actually looks edible.

ALICE	Hey !

DAVID	Hitting’s unacceptable.

ALICE	You…

DAVID	I can be very, very, very unreasonable about…

SMASH	Those kids never finished telling you what you wanted.

ROS	How to make a wish last forever ? I worked that out. The Psammead’s wishes always end at sunset. But what if we wish for something else ? What if we wish for something that could make permanent magic ?

SMASH	Like another Psammead ?

ROS	No. I’m more thinking an app hat makes people fall in love forever. Puts everything back as it was.

SMASH	So, the app disappears at sunset… but then both our parents are still together ! Ros, you’re awesome.

ROS	Thanks. You’re pretty okay too.

ROBBIE	How are we gonna sneak him in ?

ALICE	Wait, stop. I think I heard something. Um…

PSAMMEAD	Hm. There’s a startling lack of, er sand.

ROBBIE	I’ll get the buckets. Dad says you spoke to mum.

ROS	Yeah, she’s doing really well, you know. I think this university stuff’s just a temporary thing. She still really likes…

ROBBIE	Stop. Just don’t.

ROS	She’s had to make a lot of very difficult choices, Robbie. It’s not like any of this is straight forward. And then there’s…

ROBBIE	That’s dad talking. She left us, Ros. She left us.

SMASH	Oh okay, it’s ice cream.

ROS	Say it in, say it in a British…

SMASH	You go… ice cream !

DAVID	Oooh…

ALICE	What do you think ?

SMASH	Well, it’s not on fire, so I guess it’s good. This has never happened before, trust me.

ROS	Now say ‘water bottle’.

SMASH	Water bottle.

ROBBIE	Water bottle.

DAVID	What was that ?

SMASH	Oh, just me.

DAVID	It sounded like it was upstairs.

ROS	Oh actually, you know what I am tired and would like to go upstairs to do some sleeping.

SMASH	I’m also very tired too, so, yeah, I should turn in.

ROBBIE	Oyh me too. I’m really tired. Thank you.

ALICE	What’s going on ?

MAUDIE	There’s a sand monster in the bath. It’s mean but we love it.

ALICE	Oh.

PSAMMEAD	Oh ! Offerings.

ROS	We seriously have to find it a new place to live.

ALICE	Do you think it’s the tart ?

DAVID	There’s no way it’s the tart. The tart’s amazing.

ALICE	Yeah ?!

DAVID	Yeah. Actually, d’you think I should check on them ?

ALICE	Oh non. They’re up to stuff they don’t want us to know about. It’s like we’re a real family already.

SMASH	It has to be one sentence.

ROS	It is, these are semicolons.

SMASH	Wow, a use for punctuation. Who knew ? You know, if it’s too vague or if there’s holes in it, then…

ROS	It’s not. It’s waterlight. Tomorrow everything will go back to how it should be.

SMASH	Our real parents back together.

ROS	No, just together. In love, forever. Will be like we never even met.

ALICE	It was my favourite when I was her age. Tell her you got it though I don’t want her to think I’m trying to buy her.

DAVID	Four children. Double trouble.

ALICE	D’you think we can handle it ? What’s life without a challenge ?

DAVID	Really peaceful.

ALICE	I can’t wait to  see them grow and blossom.

DAVID	Yea, maybe. I wish that they’d never grow…

ROS	Do not complete that sentence !

ALICE	Hey, you’re supposed to be asleep !

DAVID	Oh, Smash I, er… I fixed your phone.

SMASH	Er, thanks.

DAVID	It’s not as flashy as it was before but, er…

SMASH	But it works. That’s what counts, right ?

DAVID	Yeah. Right.

ALICE	Okay, girls, go bach to sleep now.

ROS	Sunrise. Smash, wake up. The wish.

PSAMMEAD	Hmm

DAVID	Girls ? Girls, what’s going on there ? Why are you wet ? 

ROS	Hm, I…

SMASH	Sorry,; did we wake you getting showered ? this holiday is just so great. Why sleep through it, right ?

ROS	Yeah, yeah. We just thought we should make an early start and see the sun come up.

DAVID	D’you know what ? That is a brilliant idea. Let’s do it. Let’s start the day. Let’s have breakfast on the beach !

ROS	What ?

DAVID	Ros… let’s have a bit oh fuman interaction today. Leave he books behind, alright ?

SMASH	Them.

ROS	No !

SMASH	Come on, if you can rescue a Psammead you can do this.

PSAMMEAD	Ah ! Oh !

SMASH	You got this, it’ll be so cool. Just do it.

SURFER BOY 1	What are you doing, psycho ?

ROS	I’m sorry !

SMASH	No.

SURFER BOY 1	You’ve got issues.

ROS	I, I don’t know what came over me.

SURFER BOY 1	So, do you want to get an ice cream ?

DAVID	Okay, girls. Time to go.

PSAMMEAD	Huh ?

TRISTAN	Ah !

ROS	Hey !

SMASH	I wanna, I wanna see more photos.

ALICE	Door’s open. We’ve been robbed !

DAVID	What the… ?

SMASH	Tristan. Ros !

ROS	Tell my dad I’ve gone for a walk.

SMASH	No, I’m coming too.

ROS	No, just, go away, okay. This is my mess. If I hadn’t made that stupid time travel wish none of this would have happened. I have to sort it out.

ROBBIE	No? you don’t. We do.

MAUDIE	This is our mess, too.

ROS	Fine, just, come on then. It’ll be pretty easy to get in. We can force a window or something. I mean, the place is pretty run down.

SMASH	Whoa !

ROS	Get off !

SMASH	Get off of me !

TRISTAN	Welcome ! I knew you wouldn’t be able to resist ! Well ! What do you thing ? Dazzling, isn’t it ?

SMASH	When do the fashion police get here ? You might still have time to run.

TRISTAN	Bring them to me. But I suppose I do owe you a debt of gratitude. Une French Fancy ?

ROS	The only thing we want is the Psammead. Where is he ?

TRISTAN	Psammead ? Psammead, Psammead, Psammead, Psammead. Psammead. Oh! You mean my latest acquisition m!

ROS	What have you done to him ?

TRISTAN	Nothing. Couple of mild electric shocks. Nothing that would trouble the Geneva Convention. He’s a bit of a wuss to be honest with.

SMASH	Let him go. He’s given you everything that you want.

TRISTAN	This ? This is just the beginning. First thing I thought of. Plus pad, purple lady army, velvet. And it’s refusing to give me any more. Hm ?

PSAMMEAD	Please… I can’t.

TRISTAN	Do you see ? I need you kids to help me change its mind.

ROS	It won’t listen to us. It can only do one wish a day. Any more is dangerous for him. He could hurt himself.

TRISTAN	Oh, Ros, my dear child. I don’t need you to talk to it. I need you here so that I can change its mind.

SMASH	Get off my sister !

PSAMMEAD	Please don’t hurt them.

TRISTAN	Well, that’s rather up to you, isn’t it ? More wishes, please.

PSAMMEAD	Very well. If you must. Make a wish.

ROS	I wish that…

TRISTAN	Very good, very good ! Nearly got me there. Shoot that one first.

PSAMMEAD	Stop ! Take your wish, Tristan Trent. It will be you rlast.

TRISTAN	Yes, yes, spare me the platitude. Gold ! I wish for gold, creature. Beyond the dreams of man. Where’s my gold ?

PSAMMEAD	Children… you have to… you, you, you have to…

SMASH	It’s okay, Psammead. We’ll take care of you.

PSAMMEAD	No. You have to leave. Now.

TRISTAN	Ooh yeah ! Help !

MAUDIE	Poor sand monster.

ROS	Sammy ? Sammy !

ROBBIE	No, no !

SMASH	Robbie? Robbie, stop !

ROBBIE	No… no… I, I can’t. I can’t.

MAUDIE	Shoe sand, yum yum.

SMASH	Maudie.

MAUDIE	Sand monster’s hungry.

PSAMMEAD	Do you mind ? Careful.

SMASH	You’re gonna love this new beach.

PSAMMEAD	What’s the sand like ?

ROS	Be quiet.

SMASH	Shhh

ROS	I’ll take that.

ALICE	Okay? Let’s go. Last day, let’s make the most of it.

ALICE	Girls ! What’s that ? Where are you going ?

MAUDIE	What’s that ?!

ALICE	It’s just a shell, baby. See ?

MAUDIE	Okay, I’m over it now.

ALICE	Okay.

PSAMMEAD	Good grain. That’s quality.

ROS	So, this’ll do ?

PSAMMEAD	Oh yes. I’m digging deep. No one’s finding me for another hundred years, if I have any luck. Now, if you’ll excuse me.

SMASH	Wait !

ROS	Our final wish.

PSAMMEAD	Okay, for the last time. Wish me.

ROBBIE	So… you’re really gonna do it then ?

ROS	Yeah, our mum and dad back together. Robbie, don’t you want to be happy ? “We wish to create a mobile phone application.”

PSAMMEAD	Mmm ?

ROS	“Hereafter referred to as an app.”

MAUDIE	Ros.

ROS	What ?

MAUDIE	Why is your shoe flashing ?

ROS	I don’t know, but…

TRISTAN	Where is it ? Eh ? Where is it ?

ROS	I don’t…

ALICE	I have a signal !

DAVID	Yay, we have a signal.

ALICE	Okay… two hundred and eighty-seven emails. Nineteen voicemails. I’m on vacation.

DAVID	Is that ? Hang on.

TRISTAN	Show me to its wicked worm pit. Show me to its nest.

TRISTAN	Where it does its business ! Take me to its lair !

ROBBIE	Get off her !

TRISTAN	Its dwelling place ! Oi ! Take your hands off ! What are ou doing ?!

DAVID	What’s going on ? What’s going on ?

TRISTAN	Stay out of this, this doesn’t concern you.

DAVID	Hang on a minute.

TRISTAN	It’s between me and these children.

ROS	Dad.

DAVID	Just calm down. I’m sure we can all…

TRISTAN	Yeah, I think you should calm down and let me carry out my investigation.

ROS	Smash.

DAVID	Mr Trent, be reasonable.

TRISTAN	I’m being reasonable ! I’ve not shot them or flogged them have I ? Now whgy don’t you toddle off into the dunes with your American tart and let me take care of business.

DAVID	You keep your hands off my family ! Alice, phone the police. Oh, yes. Um, well, I have a phone too. Four bars.

SMASH	Ros, stop. No, Ros, no.

ROS	But the wish, I, I never made the wish ! It was just here. It can’t have gone far. Why aren’t you helping me ?!

ROBBIE	It, it’s gone, Ros.

ROS	No. I want it back, I want it back !

SMASH	Let it go.

PSAMMEAD	Well, I, I don’t know about anyone else but I’m still looking forward to hearing this ludicrous wish.

ROS	W-we wish t…. Can they say goodbye first ? We had a good time, didn’t we ?

SMASH	We had the best.

MAUDIE	I don’t wanna say goodbye.

ROS	But we have to, Maudie. We have to. I wish… I wish… I wish… I wish that you have a long peaceful sleep in the sand… and no-one disturbs you for at least another hundred years.

PSAMMEAD	Maybe there’s hope for you yet.

ROS	Goodbye, Psammead.

SMASH	By, Psammead. Thanks for the horrible wishes.

PSAMMEAD	Well, goodbye, children. It’s been awful knowing you.

MAUDIE	Bye bye sand monster.

ROBBIE	See you never.

PSAMMEAD	That I can promise.

DAVID	… and just the way he was behaving.

TRISTAN	Don’t, don’t, now, don’t arrest me. There’s been a misunderstanding. Un-arrest me. Arrest them ! If you’re gonna arrest anybody. He struck me, she’s American, they destroyed my house with a magical sand  thing ! It decimated my mansion ! It’s in ruins !

DAVID	Kids ?

ALICE	Are you alright ?

ROS	We’re fine. We’re all completely fine.
