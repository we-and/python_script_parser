START SUBTITLE	Fucking CIA....

START SUBTITLE	 thinks it can kill anyone, anywhere.

START SUBTITLE	When are you coming home, daddy?

START SUBTITLE	I'll be coming home very soon, my darling

START SUBITLE	Very soon.

THE LIBYAN	If you have my money I have your Judas. 

THE LIBYAN	His name is Oleg.

THE LIBYAN	...Yes, my friend, the CIA.

START SUBTITLE	We've been breached.

START SUBTITLE	Do something!

START SUBTITLE	Relax. The car is bulletproof.

LEIGH	Good job.

COLLINS	You should have told me you were running a secondary op. 

LEIGH	The risk was worth it.

LEIGH	Besides, I knew you could handle it. Like I know you can handle a follow-up action.

COLLINS	I thought ExSo was cutting me loose? 

LEIGH	They are.

LEIGH	But FullSpec have agreed to bond you out. Come on.

LEIGH	We just received //actionable intel that a tier one target is in London. 

LLEIGH	We want him off the table.

BRENNAN	Leigh said this flight would be full of fucking reprobates and degenerates, but I didn't believe her till I saw your sorry ass. 

BRENNAN	How the fuck are you, Jackie? 

COLLINS	Jesus. Mike.

COLLINS	What the hell are you doing here? I thought you retired?

BRENNAN	Retire? Shit. I can't retire. I've got three ex-wives. Anyway. You look like shit, But you know that. 

BRENNAN	Still freebasing 'go-pills'? 

LEIGH	If you guys are done bonding, we're on a clock. 

LEIGH	Intel says we have exactly twelve hours to hit the target. //

COLLINS	I work alone. You know that.

COLLINS	No offence, old man.

BRENNAN	Yeah, okay.

LEIGH	Look. This is not some third rate Haji we're going after, okay? 

LEIGH	This is a bad guy. Top of the President's kill list.

LEIGH	Brennan will be point, but it's my op.

LEIGH	Collins. I worked my ass off to get you cleared. 

BRENNAN	Why's that? EXSo afraid they got another nut-job on their hands? 

BRENNAN	You know. Just...

LEIGH	This is a FullSpec op.

BRENNAN	 Oh... that other morally considerate employer., 

BRENNAN	I hear they got their plausible deniability sewn up tighter than a camel’s asshole.

LEIGH	If you don't want to go home, London is what I got.

LEIGH	I need you.

PILOT 	Prepare for take-off.

LEIGH	Be a team player.

COLLINS	I got your back, Mike. Always., 

SAMUELSON	Yo! 

SAMUELSON	Are you people deaf? Pilot said sit down, strap in already. I'm trying to scalp this motherfucker by tonight.. 

BRENNAN	Jackie Collins, Pete Samuelson. (TO SAMUELSON) Pete. Jackie.

BRENNAN	Pete and I did Libya together. , 

BRENNAN	He was a prick then. He's a prick now. But he's a damn fine operator., 

SAMUELSON	Well, the old man's wrong. I'm even better than that.

SAMUELSON	In fact, I'm the best.

BRENNAN	Are you fucking kidding me?

BRENNAN	What the hell is Collins doing here?

LEIGH	What are you talking about?

BRENNA 	What am I talking about? Jesus Christ, Leigh. 

BRENNAN	I'm talking about a messed up war junkie who won't go home, because you people won't let him.

LEIGH	I need Collins in this fight. And so do you, Brennan.

LEIGH	I thought you were friends?

BRENNAN	No... I mean we are friends and as his friend I'm asking you. Do the guy a solid.

BRENNAN	Cut him loose. Send him home. His wife just gave birth to a kid he hasn't even laid eyes on for Christ's sake.

LEIGH	We've all made sacrifices. He can handle it.

BRENNAN	Sure. Until he blows up in your face. And then that shit's on you, honey.,

SAMUELSON	Uh-oh!
 
SAMUELSON	Where's the first half of my money?
 
LEIGH	Check it again.
 
SAMUELSON	A million fucking bucks just like that. I love Terror Tuesdays. 

LEIGH	No more Terror Tuesdays. Now it's terror all day, every day. 

LEIGH	But screw up and you get nothing but a Title Fifty disavow., 

SAMUELSON	Oh, I haven't missed a shot my whole life. And landing in some prison cell is not in my game plan.

BRENNAN	So then who's the lucky son of a bitch who tops the President's kill list?, 

LEIGH	Terry McKnight.

LEIGH	He was a deep cover operative, based in Pakistan. 

LEIGH	He became a Muslim to better understand his enemy.

LEIGH	Or so he claimed.

LEIGH	Then the ISI dug their claws into him. , 

LEIGH	Turned him. 

LEIGH	For three years he fed them our intel. //They gave that intel to the Taliban.

LEIGH	Got a lot of our guys killed...

BRENNAN	Haji hunter by day. A personal crusader by night. Shit. We're never gonna win this war.

BRENNAN	What about the man's due process?

LEIGH	He gave up his rights as an American when he became a terrorist. 

LEIGH	Fuck his due process.

SAMUELSON	Oh, um, I'm sorry did I just interrupt?

SAMUELSON	It's a good story, spook. It is. But I heard something different, 

SAMUELSON	I heard you guys fucked him when his cover was blown. Straight up disavow., 

LEIGH	Are you done

LEIGH	McKnight's there to do a deal with a group of Russian ex-FSB officers.

LEIGH	What the deal is for we don't know. But we know he's working with this man Farooq Hassan.

LEIGH	Hassan's a Syrian national. He moves intel, guns, people, but he's not ideological.

LEIGH	He's strictly about the money.

BRENNAN	He's not the only one.

LEIGH	Private sector intelligence provides him legitimate cover. 

LEIGH	These are his known associates.

LEIGH	This is where you start.

COLLINS	Wait. Go back one.

COLLINS	There.

BRENNAN	Tony Deighton. So kill the suspense already.

COLLINS	Saved his ass in Afghanistan a couple of years ago.

BRENNAN	That was good of you.

COLLINS	He thought so too.

COLLINS	IED almost blew him in half., 

BRENNAN	Look, this guy's a buddy of yours, and it turns out he's a bad guy, maybe you should sit this one out there, Jackie boy.

COLLINS	We were tight //back then. , 

COLLINS	He's my brother. Like you, Mike. 

COLLINS	He's a good operator. No way he's involved in this shit.. 

START SUBTITLE	You wanted to see me boss?

MCKNIGHT	Imash li semeistvo, Oleg? 

START SUBTITLE	You have family, Oleg?

OLEG	Da, supruga, dvama sina.

START SUBTITLE	Yes, wife, two sons.

START SUBTITLE	Family is what matters most.

MCKNIGHT	Imakh semeistvo. V drug zhivot. Trudno e da povyarvash sega.

START SUBTITLE	I had a family once...

START SUBTITLE	...in another life.

START SUBTITLE	Hard to believe now.
 
MCKNIGHT	But greed... 

MCKNIGHT	Greed is bad for business.//

OLEG	Mr McKnight...

MCKNIGHT	You should have taken the CIA's advice and used encryption.

OLEG	Please... I never meet CIA... I just do it through phone...
 
MCKNIGHT	Don't you beg.

MCKNIGHT	Now give me a name.

MCKNIGHT	Before twenty men enter your house and... violate your children.

MCKNIGHT	While your wife drowns in their semen.

OLEG	Leigh.
 
OLEG	Leigh.

OLEG	Please.

SECURITY OPERATOR #1	It's clean. , 

COLLINS	Deighton, how you doing, man? It's Jack Collins.

COLLINS	Yeah, me too, brother. Me too.

COLLINS	Look, I need to meet. I'm on the clock and I need a favour.

COLLINS	I appreciate it. Alright, I'll see you there.

BRENNAN	So, Jackie, how's the family?
 
BRENNAN	When's the last time you were Stateside?
 
COLLINS	Hey, Mike, go fuck yourself, okay.

BRENNAN	Look, You're gonna pledge your allegiance to that girl...? 
 
BRENNAN	...To the CIA, to a system that doesn't give a rat's dick about you? , 

BRENNAN	Fuck loyalty. Go home, Jack.

BRENNAN	Meet your kid. Huh? Be a father.
 
COLLINS	You’re father of the year now, Mike?
 
BRENNAN	Hell. no. I'm a three-time loser who should've been home for his kids.
 
BRENNAN	Instead, I've gotta keep taking out bad guys, so I don't drown in goddamn alimony. Fucking witches., 

DEIGHTON	There's my favourite fucking cowboy!
 
COLLINS	Deighton, you son of a bitch.
 
COLLINS	How you doing, man?
 
DEIGHTON	You're fucking looking at it, mate. Never better. You?
 
COLLINS	Good, man. I'm good.
 
COLLINS	Yeah. This is Mike Brennan and Pete Samuelson.
 
COLLINS	Tony Deighton.
 
DEIGHTON	Nice to meet you, man.
 
BRENNAN	Nice to meet you.
 
SAMUELSON	I thought you said this guy was the shit.

SAMUELSON	He don't look like much.
 
SAMUELSON	You don't look like much.
 
DEIGHTON	This prick Delta? 
 
DEIGHTON	Come on, grab a seat.

DEIGHTON	Alan.
 
DEIGHTON	So... the CIA still reckons it can win the war on terror by outsourcing it to fucking cowboys? I call that desperation.
 
BRENNAN	It's pretty fucking tragic. But you look like you do okay for yourself.
 
DEIGHTON	I do alright.
 
BRENNAN	War machine provides.

BRENNAN	That's the beauty of our capitalist system. That and we're all brothers together. Right?
 
DEIGHTON	Well, it's not like we can quit. //We miss the action too much, that's our trouble.
 
DEIGHTON	How's the family?
 
COLLINS	Ah, you know. Working on it.
 
DEIGHTON	Jesus.
 
COLLINS	Yours?
 
DEIGHTON	Joanne sacked me off for some fucking hairdresser, if you can believe that shit.. 

DEIGHTON	Lisa's shagging anything that moves just to spite her old man.
 
DEIGHTON	She's sixteen fucking years old.
 
DEIGHTON	All good, really.
 
COLLINS	You poor bastard. (LAUGHS)
 
DEIGHTON	Fuck it's good to see you, man.
 
COLLINS	You too, man. You too. It's like old times, huh?
 
COLLINS	Just glad to see you're still in the fight.
 
DEIGHTON	To bounty hunters.
 
SAMUELSON	Who's a bounty hunter? I'm a shadow warrior.
 
DEIGHTON	You're a fucking what?
 
DEIGHTON	Jesus.
 
DEIGHTON	Right, what do you need?
 
COLLINS	Our intel says he worked with you guys in Syria back, er, back when '6' ran him. 

DEIGHTON	Yeah, sure. Farooq Hassan. He's a good bloke. 

BRENNAN	You guys tight?

DEIGHTON	I helped him set up here.

DEIGHTON	So, question is what do you lot want with him?

DEIGHTON	He running some international terrorist organisation I don't know about?
 
SAMUELSON	You're funny.

SAMUELSON	It is so in your interest to cooperate with us.

BRENNAN	Deighton.

BRENNAN	We just want to talk to the guy. No big deal.

COLLINS	...Come on, D, it's for me.
 
DEIGHTON	Yeah, sure, and I'd say no problem, mate, if it was just you asking, and not three bounty hunters. Excuse me, shadow warriors.

DEIGHTON	Y'know what I mean? Farooq's my brother. Like you.

COLLINS	Look, we're not here to scalp the guy, alright?

COLLINS	And I don't want to get into details, but... our action does not conflict with your interests.

COLLINS	You have my word.

COLLINS	And we can also pay you for any information he provides.

DEIGHTON	Alright then.

SECURITY OPERATOR #1	Langley wants an update. 

SECURITY OPERATOR #1	asshole O'Neil's on the warpath. Said you'd better not fuck this up.

SECURITY OPERATOR #1	Here's that intel you wanted.

LEIGH	Thanks.

SECURITY OPERATOR #1	Shoot a spectre gunship at night when we have the chance…

DEIGHTON	Nah, Syria's fun, but nothing like the good times you and me had in Afghanistan, mate.

COLLINS	Yeah. You never did thank me for saving your ass.

DEIGHTON	You fucking prick! You ran over a fucking IED! 

COLLINS	Yeah, whatever, man. You were crying like a little bitch when I pulled you out of that thing.

DEIGHTON	I miss it though, y'know, fighting the Tali.. 

DEIGHTON	...getting in close and fucking doing the bloke.

DEIGHTON	Sticking that knife in deep. Twisting it. Seeing the poor Haji's lights go out.

DEIGHTON	Tali were some fierce fucking hombres, man.

BRENNAN	Yeah, we took a giant shit in their backyard, what'd you expect?

DEIGHTON	Almost there, mate.

DEIGHTON	Alright just round this next bend. 

DEIGHTON	Hassan's gonna meet us there.
 
SAMUELSON	Argh!

SAMUELSON	What the fuck!

BRENNAN	Samuelson, quit fucking around. Grab the M4s. 

COLLINS	Don't fucking shoot him. We need him alive. //

BRENNAN	We've gotta catch the prick first. Slow down. It's a fucking ambush.

BRENNAN	Take the shot.

DEIGHTON	Terry McKnight says hello.

SAMUELSON	Collins.

COLLINS	He's dead.

COLLINS	What are you doing? Move! Move!

SAMUELSON	Move!

COLLINS	Move!

LEIGH	What's done is done. Brennan's death changes nothing. We still have a job to do.

COLLINS	You need to cut Samuelson loose before he gets killed.

SAMUELSON	Are you fucking kidding me?

COLLINS	I need to go at this alone.

SAMUELSON	It was me who saved you, dumbass.

COLLINS	He's baggage I don't need.

SAMUELSON	And he's a fucking liability.

SAMUELSON	You took one too many ‘Go-pills.’ Brennan's death is on you. 

SAMUELSON	Oh, you want to go, motherfucker? 

LEIGH 	Alright, knock it off. 

LEIGH	Find a way to work together or you're done. Both of you. 

LEIGH	And you're on the next flight home.

LEIGH	I need you to draw Deighton out, extract him and bring him here.

LEIGH	Keith and Dave will assist.

COLLINS	Look, Leigh. If we track Deighton, we've got a better chance at locating McKnight than ambushing…

SAMUELSON	What, you want to //drive around all night?

COLLINS	We need to fight smart.

LEIGH	Collins, no one doubts your commitment, okay?

LEIGH 	We're all upset about Brennan.

LEIGH	Just take a minute. And then tell me your head is still in the game.

LEIGH	You'll take command on the ground.

SAMUELSON	Roger that. 

SAMUELSON	What happens to Brennan's share?

SAMUELSON	What the fuck is wrong with you?

SAMUELSON	Fucking cocksucker!

LEIGH	Goddamnit enough!

LEIGH	If either one of you jeopardises my operation it'll be the last thing you ever do.

LEIGH	Now go!

LOGAN	D, let me explain...

DEIGHTON	Shut the fuck up.

DEIGHTON	Now I gotta throw bodies at this. You ever fuck up an ambush again I will fucking shoot you. You understand? 

DEIGHTON	This ends before it begins.

LOGAN	I'm fucking on it, boss., 

DEIGHTON	Alright. Hassan. You're blown, mate. Take off 

HASSAN	Roger that.

LOGAN	D. Are we really gonna go to war with the fucking CIA?

DEIGHTON	Just concentrate on protecting our investment.

DEIGHTON	I'll take care of the rest.

DEIGHTON	Alright, ladies and gentlemen. We're on the move. //

DEIGHTON	You were right. The CIA sent a bunch of bounty hunters to take you out. We clipped their team leader. 

MCKNIGHT	One of them is an old friend of yours, I believe.

MCKNIGHT	Who saved your life in, um, Afghanistan or something like that?

DEIGHTON	Yeah. Collins. Ex-SEAL. Almost on my level. Almost. 

MCKNIGHT	Those SEALs are as good as it gets, Deighton.

DEIGHTON	Terry. Your security is paramount to me. I'm taking you to the boat.

DEIGHTON	Alright?

DEIGHTON	Ivan here will take care of you now.

MCKNIGHT	Is that really how you wanna run your opsec? 

DEIGHTON	I keep you moving, Terry. I keep you alive.

DEIGHTON	Besides we're done here, right? There's no more chatter., 

MCKNIGHT	You stay where you are.

MCKNIGHT	Listen, Anthony...

DEIGHTON	Bloke who gave me this, he got introduced to the way of the knife.

DEIGHTON	Him and his whole fucking family.

DEIGHTON	You're fine.

MCKNIGHT	Just don't get sentimental on me, Deighton.

MCKNIGHT	Not with the money I'm paying you.

DEIGHTON	Oh, I'll put Collins down, don't you worry about that.

DEIGHTON	Let's just not give him the opportunity to put you down, Terry. 

DEIGHTON	Not before the account's been settled.

MCKNIGHT	So this friend of yours - Collins...

MCKNIGHT	He say anything about his handler?

DEIGHTON	No, Something I should know?

DEIGHTON	Terry?

DEIGHTON	This is where you learn to trust me.

MCKNIGHT	You know what the Russians say about trust? 'Trust in God, mind your own fucking business.'

MCKNIGHT	Her name is Leigh Allen and she's a true believer.

MCKNIGHT	You could say I'm her special project.

MCKNIGHT	Blames me for killing her father when he and I were stationed in South Waziristan together.

DEIGHTON	Did you?

MCKNIGHT	She believes it.

MCKNIGHT	The reality is... more complicated.

MCKNIGHT	Like Waziristan itself - you know less when you leave, than you do when you arrive.

DEIGHTON	So?

MCKNIGHT	So, she's a very confused and angry young woman.

DEIGHTON	And angry and confused young women do stupid things.

MCKNIGHT	Not stupid.

MCKNIGHT	Dangerous. And she's got an endless black budget to do them with. 

DEIGHTON	Jackie.

DEIGHTON	You're upset about Brennan, I understand. It's tough losing a bloke like that.

DEIGHTON	And, you know, I'd be a liar if I said I didn't enjoy it. But it's not personal.

DEIGHTON	Right? It's not personal, it's just business.

COLLINS	What part of murdering my friend isn't personal?

COLLINS	You know how this is gonna end, right?
 
DEIGHTON	Yeah, I reckon I do.

COLLINS	I've gotta put you down, D.

DEIGHTON	Listen, do you really want your kid to grow up without his dad, Jackie?

DEIGHTON	I'm offering you an out, mate. Go home, go home now.
 
DEIGHTON	You've given enough to the cause.

COLLINS	You're over reaching.
 
COLLINS	Fine, this time I'm not going to save you.

COLLINS	I'm going to bury you.
 
COLLINS	Why'd you turn, man?

COLLINS	It can't just be about the money.
 
DEIGHTON	Can't it? You think you're not expendable?
 
DEIGHTON	Tell you what, you try telling the Afghan story to your handler. See how she reacts.
 
DEIGHTON	Because when the ends justify the means the CIA will dump you in a fucking heartbeat to get what it wants. , 
 
COLLINS	One, two, three.
 
COLLINS	Let's hope Leigh disabled the alarm.
 
SAMUELSON	It's multi-locked.
 
COLLINS	Step aside.
 
TECH/CONTACTOR	D, the Yanks just broke into our office. 

DEIGHTON	Alright. Let's go earn some money.
 
SAMUELSON	Take a ‘Go-pill.’
 
COLLINS	Let's go.
 
DEIGHTON	Right, we're almost there. I don't want any fireworks outside my office, understood? 

COLLINS	What the hell are you doing?
 
SAMUELSON	Fun's not done yet, fucknuts., 

COLLINS	Fucksake!
 
COLLINS	What the fuck?, 

DEIGHTON	Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

DEIGHTON	Fucking Yanks. Always got to blow shit up. 

DEIGHTON	Paul.

DEIGHTON	You and Janusz wait here for the police, fire service, to show up. Handle it.

CONTACTOR PAUL	Roger that.

SAMUELSON	Let's go.

DEIGHTON	Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.
 
DEIGHTON	Should of taken the out, my friend. , 

TECH CONTRACTOR	Alright, I've got their phone.

TECH CONTRACTOR	They're headed east.

SAMUELSON	Your boyfriend took the bait., 

SAMUELSON	You're welcome., 

SAMUELSON	Deighton's on his way. Where's the kill zone?

LEIGH	A disused factory.
 
LEIGH	My guys will rendezvous with you there. Sending location now.
 
SAMUELSON	There are two ways into the factory.

SAMUELSON	Here and here.

SAMUELSON	Once Deighton's inside Leigh will paint the target and we'll pull him into the ambush // here for the extract.

COLLINS	Better hope her // guys are up to the task

COLLINS	We have to separate Deighton to extract him. He's going to be throwing bodies at this.

TECH CONTRACTOR	They're leading us to a disused factory, D.

DEIGHTON	Oh, how lovely. Got to love // a CIA kill site.

TECH CONTRACTOR	Guess they're serious about dying.

DEIGHTON	So call in the reinforcements

LEIGH	Night vision coming online.

LEIGH	What the hell?

SAMUELSON	We're not going to need tracking devices.

SECURITY OPERATOR #1	So //what's the plan?

SAMUELSON	The plan?
 
SAMUELSON	The plan is for you to shut the fuck up and listen.

SAMUELSON	That's the fucking plan.

COLLINS	So keep your shit wired tight...

COLLINS	We're expecting multiple hostiles.

DEIGHTON	On three. One, two, three.

DEIGHTON	Keep your spacing. Kill anything that moves.

LEIGH	I'm seeing seven tangos. 

LEIGH	Be advised, target is painted. Heading north. 

LEIGH	Shit… No. Come on.

SAMUELSON	Draw them to the ambush.

SECURITY OPERATOR #1	Roger that.,

SAMUELSON	Remember we have to separate Deighton.

LEIGH	Target is fifty metres to the ambush.

SAMUELSON	You two guys keep your shit together. 

COLLINS	Don't engage Deighton until he's out of the kill zone. We need him // separated from his men.

LEIGH	Fuck!

LEIGH	Be advised I have lost visual.
 
COLLINS	(OVER) Fuck!

SAMUELSON	Do it! //
	
LEIGH	I have lost visual.

SAMUELSON	The fuck are you doing?
 
COLLINS	Go.

SAMUELSON	Come on, you son of a bitch.

LOGAN TO ALL	On me. Move.

SECURITY OPERATOR #1	Extract. Move.

SECURITY OPERATOR #2	Move, motherfucker. Move.

COLLINS	Come on. Let's go.

SAMUELSON	Why the fuck did you let Deighton get away?
 
SAMUELSON	We had him.

SAMUELSON	(REACTS, PAIN)

SAMUELSON	You had a job to do. You should've done it.

SAMUELSON	You should have left me.

COLLINS	Trust me, I thought about it.

SAMUELSON	Fuck!

COLLINS	On me. 

SAMUELSON	Where the fuck is the car?

COLLINS	Come on, let's go.

COLLINS	You're lucky your vest took that shot.

SAMUELSON	Yeah, I feel fucking lucky.

DEIGHTON	Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

LOGAN	There's no sign of them, D.

DEIGHTON	Alright, get back to McKnight.

LOGAN	Roger that.

LEIGH	Keith. Talk to me. Give me a sitrep. 

DEIGHTON	Oh, Keith can't come to the phone right now on account of him being dead. KIA. This other fella here too., 

DEIGHTON	Collins and Samuelson are next, Leigh...

DEIGHTON	You know who this is?
 
LEIGH	You're compromised, Deighton.

DEIGHTON	Oh, is that right?

LEIGH	But maybe there's an opportunity in your compromise.

LEIGH	Do you get what I'm saying? 

DEIGHTON	Why don't you enlighten me, sweetheart? 

LEIGH	Men can be replaced.

LEIGH	Opportunities cannot.
 
DEIGHTON	This opportunity... is it mutually beneficial?

LEIGH	Why don't we find out.

SAMUELSON	What the fuck is wrong with you?

SAMUELSON	Let's get the fuck out of here.

COLLINS	You alright, man?

SAMUELSON	Yeah, I'm alright. What, I don't look alright to you?
 
SAMUELSON	Not the first bullet I've taken.

SAMUELSON	Anyway... thanks.

COLLINS	Come on, don't leave me hanging., 

COLLINS	Come on.

SAMUELSON	I lost focus back there. // That's not like me.

SAMUELSON	Two million ain't enough for this bullshit. I'll tell you that right now. , 

SAMUELSON	Fuck it.

SAMUELSON	Two cars are stationary. And one is moving towards the river.

COLLINS	Son of a bitch. // McKnight's holed up on a goddamn boat., 

COLLINS	Call Leigh again. We need a re-up asap., 

DEIGHTON	Hm.

LEIGH	You were expecting someone older.

LEIGH	Most men do.

DEIGHTON	I'm not most men.

SAMUELSON	Where the fuck is she?

SAMUELSON	What do you think?

COLLINS	We have a shot. If we jack the boat before Deighton shows up., 

SAMUELSON	Let's get on it then.

DEIGHTON	Collins is finished.

DEIGHTON	We both know it. If you want McKnight as much as I think you do... I'm your only option.

LEIGH	You know... aiding a tier one terrorist automatically puts you on the list right beside them.

LEIGH	But, be that as it may, you were smart to call me, // because I can keep you off that list.

LEIGH	So why don't you help me decide if we can can work together. What is McKnight buying from the Russians?

DEIGHTON	What's the bounty on him?

LEIGH	Let's start with a million dollars.
 
DEIGHTON	Warhead for a tactical nuke. But that's not why you're here...

LEIGH	You had this all planned out.
 
LEIGH	Right from the start. My God...

LEIGH	You figured you could make money from both sides be a hero for killing McKnight, and be in line for future CIA contracts.

LEIGH	Who's to say if you're actually helping him.

DEIGHTON	You want revenge for daddy? Then I am it, sweetheart. Because I understand.

DEIGHTON	I understand, it's, it's fucking, it's cold-blooded what he did.
 
DEIGHTON	Hmm?  I can imagine what that's like.

LEIGH	McKnight beheaded my father and emailed me the video.
 
LEIGH	You cannot even begin to imagine what that's like.

DEIGHTON	And the CIA sanctioned this?

LEIGH	Get me McKnight and the warhead and I'll triple whatever he's paying you.

DEIGHTON	Call off your attack dogs, you've got a deal.

LEIGH	Collins and Samuelson are your problem.

DEIGHTON	Then where are they?

SAMUELSON	You gotta figure there's three guys from Deighton's group inside.

COLLINS	At least three.

SAMUELSON	Plus two or three of them are McKnight's bodyguards.

SAMUELSON 	Dude, this is gonna be brutal.

SAMUELSON	A lot of ground to cover.

SAMUELSON	Where the fuck is Leigh?

COLLINS	Weapons check.

SAMUELSON	I got four for the Shorty., 

SAMUELSON	Five for the Glock.

SAMUELSON	Could be worse.

COLLINS	I’ve five for the Shorty and five for the Glock.

COLLINS	Sure you wanna do this? 

SAMUELSON	It's gonna be a righteous kill. 

COLLINS	Amen.

SAMUELSON	Don't. Hey. Don't. Don't mock God. She doesn't like that.

SAMUELSON	Let's go shoot this fucking guy.

SAMUELSON	How many others on the boat?

CONTRACTOR	It's just us.

SAMUELSON	Where's McKnight?

SAMUELSON	Where is McKnight?

CONTRACTOR	Deighton knows you're here.

SAMUELSON	How?

CONTRACTOR	I don't know. Please, I swear to God I don't...

SAMUELSON	Let's get the fuck out of here, right now.

COLLINS	Contact., 

SAMUELSON	Move. 

COLLINS	Move.

COLLINS	We gotta get the fuck outta here. Extract.

SAMUELSON	The car. The car.

SAMUELSON	Mag change.

SAMUELSON	Move! Move!

COLLINS	Mag change.

COLLINS	Move.

SAMUELSON	The container.

COLLINS	Move.

DEIGHTON	The car. The car. Take the fucking car.

COLLINS	Samuelson, move.

DEIGHTON	Wah-hoo! Come on, you fucking Delta pussy. 

DEIGHTON	Stop hiding, you fucking coward.

DEIGHTON	Come on.

SAMUELSON	Fuck it.

COLLINS	Samuelson, what the fuck are you doing?

DEIGHTON	You should've counted your rounds.

DEIGHTON	Never did rate you Delta twats. 

DEIGHTON	I got this, Logan.

DEIGHTON	Right, drop the pistol. Drop the pistol. Drop the long. 

DEIGHTON	Drop the fucking pistol. Drop it.

DEIGHTON	Drop the long.

DEIGHTON	Good. Now...

DEIGHTON	Let's say we settle this the old fashioned way.

DEIGHTON	Huh?

DEIGHTON	Come on.

SAMUELSON	You hold that knife like a bitch., 

DEIGHTON	Send Brennan my regards.

DEIGHTON	Samuelson's dead. Lights out.

DEIGHTON	Collins.

DEIGHTON	Hear me mate, he's dead.

DEIGHTON	Just you now.

DEIGHTON	Just you.

COLLINS	Fuck!

CONTRACTOR	Deighton. He's here.

CONTRACTOR	Deighton, he's over here.

MCKNIGHT	How about you tell me, what the fuck is going on, Deighton?

DEIGHTON	They got lucky. It won't happen again. You got nothing to worry about.

MCKNIGHT	You think they're fucking lucky? Is that what I'm gonna tell the Russians? 'They got fucking lucky!'

MCKNIGHT	I warned you those SEALs were good!!

DEIGHTON	One left, Terry. One left and he's a fucking ...

MCKNIGHT	The exchange is blown, and so is my out!!

MCKNIGHT	The Russians will not tolerate last minute changes.

MCKNIGHT	Neither will my buyers. How the fuck did they find me?

DEIGHTON	Calm down. I'll get you a new exchange and an out, right. Your jihadis still get their warhead.

MCKNIGHT	You know why you'll always remain second tier, Deighton?
 
MCKNIGHT	Prejudice.

DEIGHTON	Oh.

MCKNIGHT	Small minded prejudice. My buyers are not jihadis. 

MCKNIGHT	Empires are destroyed from within.

MCKNIGHT	I am merely accelerating the process.

DEIGHTON	Alright. Don't make you any less dangerous to be around, but, like I said, you've got nothing to worry about.

DEIGHTON	Alright? I'll handle it.

DEIGHTON	I will handle it, Terry.

MCKNIGHT	Yeah, you do that.

DEIGHTON	This is Janusz and Paul. They'll take care of you.

MCKNIGHT	Janusz and Paul?

DEIGHTON	Hm-hm.

MCKNIGHT	Fuck.

MCKNIGHT	TJD Security. The best protection money can buy.

MCKNIGHT	Deighton.

MCKNIGHT	Once you've dealt with Collins, take out Leigh.

MCKNIGHT	Maybe I'll double what I'm paying you.

DEIGHTON	Tell you what? As a gesture of good faith, I'll do it for free.

FLOOR MANAGER	Let me know when you guys are ready.

COLLINS	Samuelson's dead.

LEIGH	What happened?

COLLINS	We tracked McKnight to the river. He was holed up on a boat. It was an ambush.

COLLINS	Somehow Deighton knew we were coming.

COLLINS	McKnight was long gone.

COLLINS	What happened to you?

LEIGH	My guy, Keith, despite that cluster-fuck at the factory, somehow managed to survive.

LEIGH	He was alive long enough for Deighton to extract everything he needed.

LEIGH	Then Deighton breached the safe house. I had to ditch all our coms. 

LEIGH	Can you finish?

COLLINS	Yeah, I can finish and then I'm done.

LEIGH	Look. If you quit, this war, it won't just end. Okay?

LEIGH	You have an obligation.

LEIGH	I thought you were committed?

LEIGH	Who'll protect the homeland?

COLLINS	Are we protecting the homeland? Or are we just making more enemies?

LEIGH	McKnight is a bad guy.

LEIGH	And that bad guy is buying a warhead for a tactical nuke.

LEIGH	This comes straight from Langley.

LEIGH	After that McKnight is gone and his threat becomes a reality.

LEIGH	Are we gonna take him out?

COLLINS	Most people, they don't realise the level of violence that we are capable of.

LEIGH	Excuse me?

COLLINS	I once slit the throats of four Afghans.

COLLINS	There was fierce fighting in this mountain region.
 
COLLINS	We found them in a cave. Three old men and one young kid.

COLLINS	They were unarmed.

COLLINS	Farmers... who'd got caught up in the fighting.

COLLINS	Pretty sure they were taking turns fucking this kid.

LEIGH	Collins...

COLLINS	I told them if they cooperated we'd treat them humanely.

COLLINS	So they did. They were scared.

COLLINS	We were cut-off from our unit so they agreed to lead us out.

COLLINS	Neither of us had a choice. We needed out.

COLLINS	They didn't want the Taliban to see them helping us. For obvious reasons.

COLLINS	But they were afraid that we'd kill them once they’d led us to safety.

COLLINS	We promised we wouldn't.

COLLINS	Once we'd cleared the danger I slit their throats.

COLLINS	I did the kid first.

COLLINS	He looks at me.

COLLINS	He can't believe it.

COLLINS	I promised him.

COLLINS	Now I'm betraying him.

COLLINS	And all I can say is, 'Sorry, kid...It's my nature.'

LEIGH	You had no way to verify if they were Taliban.

LEIGH	You saved lives.

LEIGH	You did what you were supposed to do.

LEIGH	It's not a betrayal if there's a greater objective.

COLLINS	Deighton was right.

COLLINS	I have given enough to the cause.

LEIGH	Look. The President gave us the green light. 

LEIGH	Now either we execute, or a lot of people are gonna get killed who don't need to get killed.

COLLINS	Then let's finish this.

SECURITY ENGINEER	Okay. What do you guys need?

LEIGH	I want you to hack TJD Security's servers.

SECURITY ENGINEER	Okay. So all of their registered domains are down.

SECURITY ENGINEER	I'm not gonna get anything here., 

LEIGH	What about Deighton's wife, his kids, his dog?

COLLINS	We're not touching the guy's family. They're civilians.

LEIGH	You wanna go home to your family? 

LEIGH	Find me Deighton's.

COLLINS	If we do this, we do it my way.
 
COLLINS	Understood?

COLLINS	Search Lisa Deighton.

SECURITY ENGINEER	Lisa Deighton.

MCKNIGHT	Take me to the hotel.

COLLINS	Alright. She's got a phone and that phone's got a location.

SECURITY ENGINEER	She's at a pub on Longcroft Road. 

SECURITY ENGINEER	The George and Dragon.

COLLINS	Gear?

LEIGH	There's a car outside.

COLLINS	Alright. Here's what I want you to do.

DEIGHTON	Right, we've got him.

CONTRACTOR	go get paid.

LOGAN 	set.

CONTRACTOR	Roger that. 

MCKNIGHT	How we doing?

BODYGUARD	All quiet on the Western front, boss.

MCKNIGHT	That's what they said the night before 9/11.

MCKNIGHT	It ain't over till it's over. Stay alert. Take five. I got this. 

DEIGHTON	Take him down.

LOGAN	Fuck!

COLLINS	Take me to the warehouse.

COLLINS	Let's go.

LOGAN TO COLLINS	Just fucking shoot me.

COLLINS	You got a family.

LEIGH	Deighton.

DEIGHTON	Collins is being put down as we speak.

DEIGHTON	I'm on my way to the warehouse to kill McKnight and get your warhead.

DEIGHTON	Get my money ready.

LEIGH	I'll see you there.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Odna boyegolovka, strogo v sootvestvii s zakazom.(SUBTITLED IN UK VERSION)

START SUBTITLE	One warhead...

START SUBTITLE	as requested.

MCKNIGHT	Vsegda priyatno imet' s vami delo, Lena. 

START SUBTITLE	As always, pleasure doing business with you, Lena.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Vzaimno. Nadeyus', ne v posledniy raz. 

START SUBTITLE	I hope it's not the last time.


DEIGHTON	Bastard.

DEIGHTON	Fucking bastard.

COLLINS	So...

COLLINS	How much is Leigh paying Deighton?

COLLINS	How much?

LOGAN	If I knew that, I'd be running the fucking show

LOGAN	Deighton's gonna fuckin' tear you apart.

COLLINS	Man, all I wanna do is go home.

DEIGHTON	We're inside.

LEIGH	What happened?

LEIGH	Collins? Did you get him?

MCKNIGHT	Hello, Leigh.

MCKNIGHT	Long time no speak.

MCKNIGHT	I want Deighton to hear this too.

LEIGH	You're gonna die tired, you son of a bitch.

MCKNIGHT	Deighton?

DEIGHTON	Yeah, I'm here, Terry.

MCKNIGHT	You two are gonna make a beautiful couple.

MCKNIGHT	You made the wrong play, my friend.

MCKNIGHT	You got greedy.

MCKNIGHT	What do you think is gonna happen when Leigh goes before her bosses and...

MCKNIGHT	...explains how she failed to eliminate me?

MCKNIGHT	After they foolishly sanctioned her personal vendetta.
 
MCKNIGHT	She'll throw you under a bus before she pays you so why don't you do what you so kindly offered to do before and pop the bitch. 

MCKNIGHT	It's the only way you're gonna get out of this.

MCKNIGHT	So long, Deighton.

LEIGH	Think it through before you make a move.

LEIGH	We can still take him. There's still time.

DEIGHTON	Get me McKnight's exfil. Right now. , 

CONTRACTOR	Ah-huh. Understood. I'll call you back.

CONTRACTOR	Now you are going to tell me how McKnight is going to exfil.
 
CONTRACTOR	Understood?

BODYGUARD	I don't know what you are talking about.

CONTRACTOR	Then you find yourself in a very unfortunate position, my friend.

BODYGUARD	W,w,w, wait, w,w,w,wait, wait. I can find him. I can find him. Okay?

CONTRACTOR	So find him.

LEIGH	Deighton, listen to me. We can still...

DEIGHTON	Shut up.

DEIGHTON	Talk to me.

DEIGHTON	Alright. Good work.

DEIGHTON	Ethan.
	
LEIGH	Drop the gun. Do it now.

DEIGHTON	That's it. Drop the gun.

DEIGHTON	Good boy.

DEIGHTON	See, that is why you never trust a woman.

DEIGHTON	It's alright, sweetheart. I have twice the motivation to drop McKnight. 

DEIGHTON	He's headed for Gridstone Airfield.

DEIGHTON	Let's go.

LOGAN	Deighton, I'm sorry.
 
COLLINS	Drop your fucking weapon.

DEIGHTON	You fucking drop it.

COLLINS	Drop your fucking weapon. Drop it.

LOGAN	Deighton,wait no...(GRUNTS)

COLLINS	Lights out.

LEIGH	Jack.

LEIGH	Collins.

COLLINS	Don't say a fucking word.

MCKNIGHT	Where's the plane?

MERCENARY 1	It's coming. Twenty minutes.

MERCENARY 1 	I could do for short notice.

MCKNIGHT	Goddamnit.

MERCENARY 1	Can wait in there.

MCKNIGHT	Alright. Let's go.
 
MCKNIGHT	Come on.

COLLINS	We're taking McKnight's plane home.

COLLINS	Let your people know.

LEIGH	The money?

COLLINS	I don't want your fucking money.

LEIGH	Do you know why I'm doing this?

LEIGH	McKnight ... 

COLLINS	Wait for my call.

MERCENARY 2	He's here.

MCKNIGHT	Jesus Christ.

MCKNIGHT	Go.

MCKNIGHT	Cover me!

MCKNIGHT	What the fuck you waiting for?

MCKNIGHT	Go.
