WIFE/MOM	Fuck.
WOMAN	You are not only a mom. hot, single lady.
WOMAN	You are a smart, single woman. You are a well-educated female person.
WOMAN	God. I don’t want to date the man that wants to date that.
WOMAN	This is bad.
LITTLE GIRL	Mooommmmmmm! I can fly!!!!! You are a
WOMAN	Fuuuuck.
COFFEE CHUGGING MOM	Let’s do this.
COFFEE CHUGGING MOM	Riley, did you bring down your cleats? Gracie!
COFFEE CHUGGING MOM	Show and tell?
COFFEE CHUGGING MOM	Will, do you have your helmet and pads?
COFFEE CHUGGING MOM	Are those boys still giving you a hard time at practice?
COFFEE CHUGGING MOM	Screw football. Let’s try karate!
COFFEE CHUGGING MOM	Fuck.
AMELIA	Can we listen to singing music?
MOM	Not right now. Mommy wants to hear what the President is saying. Are you buckled in?
AMELIA	Can I play on your phone?
MOM	Nope. We’ll be at school in less than five minutes.
AMELIA	Can I have it pleeeeaaasse?
MOM	Honey, you can keep asking the same question but Mommy will keep giving you the same answer.
AMELIA	AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
MOM	Amelia, you know we don’t do screens before school.
MOM	Oh my God! Oh my God!
WYATT	Poo poo! Poo poo!
MOM	Fuuuuuck!
MELANIE	Afternoon, Jen. Gorgeous day we’ve got, huh?
JEN	It is. It’s so bright out. Do you really need that flashlight?
MELANIE	Well, probably wouldn’t have seen  Greyson pick his nose and wipe it on the back of your seat just nowwithout it. What do you think?
MELANIE	Don’t worry. They a trip to the car I’ve got a coupon all do it. Maybe wash is in order? for y
JEN	I haven’t seen an actual coupon in years. Thanks.
ENTHUSIASTIC MOM	Hi Kate! Owen is begging for a play date with the boys. Maybe you’ll come over and we can all--
KATE	Oh! That’s the call I’m expecting. Silent. It was on silent.
MELANIE	Orange cones, no phones! Pretty sure that’s twice this month.
KATE	Hey! I was ordering milk! of milk! I’m out
MELANIE	Trader Joe’s isminutes away you know.
KATE	I don’t do markets. Give me back  my phone Meliss - Melodie, I mean--
MELANIE	It’s Melanie, Kate. We’ve been going to this school now for what? years? ? You know the rules: If I see you text, I must arrest.
KATE	Not a rule, definitely not a rhyme. Now give me my phone! Please Mel-an-ie?
MELANIE	Your set up doesn’t look too kid friendly back there. Does this beauty even have anti-lock brakes? 
KATE	Of course it does...and power windows. Shit.
KATE	Fucking nut.
TEACHER SHERRY	...Then Teacher Sherry witnessed Amelia offering her green spot on the rug. The empathy that displays, Ameli It’s profound.
EMILY	C’mon bug, let’s go get your things.
EMILY	That’s one cute cubby. I think the  rosebudding really takes it to thenext level.
JAMIE	“Rosebudding,” I like it. That’ll  get a lot of likes.
LEXIE	Now I get the iPad, Mommy?
JAMIE	As soon as we get in the car,sweetie. Remember you get to sleep at Daddy’s tonight. And mommy gets some alone time!
EMILY	I can’t even remember what that’s like.
JAMIE	Hey, I know this is kind of last minute but Melanie, you know, Grace’s mom? She and I are going out tomorrow night. I snagged a  reservation at that new tapas place. Want to join maybe?
EMILY	A topless place?
JAMIE	No! Tap-as!
EMILY	Oh! That’s so nice.
JAMIE	We like to have these fun mom  dinners every couple of weeks.
JAMIE	Lots of wine. No kids. It’s kindof heaven.
EMILY	Sounds like it.
MELANIE	Hi ladies.
JAMIE	Mel, Emily’s going to come with us tomorrow night.
MELANIE	Fantastic! Good, I love welcoming new moms to the Happy Days community. Can’t wait to hear your story, Emily.
EMILY	Um, would you guys mind if I invited Kate?
JAMIE	Kate with the twin boys?
MELANIE	You’re friends with her?
EMILY	Yeah, we went to high school together. She’s the one who got Amelia in here last minute when we moved.
JAMIE	Really? Kate doesn’t usually do stuff with us other moms. Or even return my email. But I know she got it. I have that sent-return thing-- But maybe since you’re so close. I mean, it would be really cool if she came.
MELANIE	It would be wonderful. By all means, please do invite her!
EMILY	Okay... Thanks, I’ll mention it.
MELANIE	Looking forward, Emily! See you at hours tomorrow. We’re gonna have so much fun! I bet my left tit that bitch Kate doesn’t come.
KATE	Hello, gorgeous. Mommy!
BOYS	Mom! Moooommmmmmm. No answer.
KATE	Hi. I know you’re downstairs. Can you come deal with the kids? I’m having some Alone time.
HENRY/ HARRY	He took it. He’s lying. Mom!
LUCAS/ SAM	You’ve gotta help me!
KATE	Who Who One at a time, dudes.  One at a time.
LUCAS	Make them shut up. I’m in the playoffs.
SAM	The twins knocked over my Legos and I have to poop!
HENRY	He took my saber!
HARRY	Because it’s mine! It’s Emily. (The conversation is in SPLIT
KATE	Hi. Sorry I couldn’t talk at pick- up. I can’t take hanging around there. (listening a few seconds) You had shit on your face, but you’re worried your kid learned the word fuck?
EMILY	I never swear in front of them.
KATE	Fuck, I’d be more worried about pink eye.
EMILY	You know, until this one came along I didn’t realize how many times a day a baby S-H-I-T-S.
KATE	Now you know what you were really missing when you were pulling those -hour work days.
EMILY	Oh my god! I can’t believe how much my life still revolves around other people’s S-H-I-T.
KATE	Oh, I can.
EMILY	So what time do you want us tonight?
KATE	Dinner. Yeah. Like ?
EMILY	You need me to bring anything? What are we having?
KATE	It’s, um, a surprise.
FRANCESCA	I love it Emily. You look beautiful.
EMILY	Really? You’ve just never seen me with my hair brushed.
FRANCESCA	Not true. Hey, I can do the laundry later if you want?
EMILY	Oh, you don’t have to do that.
FRANCESCA	It’s no problem, really. I like to keep busy. I can straighten up the kitchen, empty the dishwasher?
EMILY	You’re so sweet. How about you veg out in front of the TV and eat our food. That would make me feel comfortable.
FRANCESCA	Alright.
EMILY	Maybe just the dishwasher...
AMELIA	Daddy’s home!
TOM	Amelia Bedelia!
TOM	I like what you’re making here, beauty. What is it? It looks like a
AMELIA	It’s a whale spraying mommy.
TOM	Ah, of course. I see it. I didn’t know mommy liked that.
EMILY	A whale’s never tried that on mommy.
FRANCESCA	Well, the chances of you getting that close to a whale are highly unlikely.
TOM	Look at this! An architect like daddy. On cue Wyatt knocks over the block tower.
EMILY	Think he’s more into demo.
EMILY	He hates to mess up my lipstick.
FRANCESCA	You’ve trained him well.
KATE	...Make-a-Meal. I bought it at the last school auction. Had to bid on something.
TOM	This food’s from last year?
KATE	Yes.
TOM	What is this “Chopped?” Are we going to be judged on our work?
ANDREW	It’s a delivery thing. Start up. I actually might invest. It’s locally sourced, organic, ethically raised. Just got dropped off.
TOM	In what? An electric tractor being pulled by a rescue dog?
ANDREW	It’s literally farm to table.
TOM	Technically, it’s farm to box to table.
EMILY	Kate, I think this is a really creative ide
KATE	Thanks, Em.
TOM	Emily, are we supposed to put the vegetables in first and then the  cheese?
EMILY	It doesn’t matter.melt. It’ll still
TOM	Of course it matters. It’s the recipe. If the cheese went in first it would say that.
ANDREW	Babe, this is so delicious. Seems satisfied and
ANDREW	Cheers, guys. To you and your new beginning.
TOM	Thanks. This move is going to be good for us.
KATE	And great for us, Em. Now we can hang like old times, just the girls.
EMILY	Speaking of just girls -- a couple of moms from school invited me out for a “fun mom dinner.”
KATE	That sounds awful.
EMILY	Yeah. Totally.
KATE	You didn’t say yes, did you?
EMILY	No...
KATE	Because if you did...
EMILY	I did.
KATE	You did?
EMILY	No, I didn’t.
KATE	Wait. Did you say yes or no? What the fuck, I’m lost.
EMILY	I did. Say yes. I think. Sorry, I  just thought...
KATE	Well, you have to get out of it.Say Wyatt is sick or--
ANDREW	Don’t listen to her, Em. You should go with her, babe. It’s a fun mom dinner. How can that not be...you know...fun?
KATE	Shut the fuck up, hon. Which moms were they?
EMILY	One of them’s named Jamie.
ANDREW	Oh, I know her. Well, I don’t know- know her. I follow her on Instagram. She’s a bit of an over-sharer.
KATE	Seriously Andrew? Some wives would be pissed about this, but I think I’m just embarrassed for you.
ANDREW	Here. Check her out.
KATE	Uch. If it’s “me time” why does she feel the need to share it with “us.”  Who’s the other mom?
EMILY	Melanie.
KATE	Okay, that woman’s batshit crazy. I think she runs a fight club in the Helping Hand yard.
EMILY	They were just trying to be nice.
TOM	I think that’s great. Emily shouldmake some other friends here, widen  her circle.
ANDREW	Widen her circle?
ANDREW	That sounds sexual.
EMILY	Look what I found in the move. She slides the paper to Kate.
KATE	Oh my god! It’s our sex questionnaire from sophomore year. You kept this?  She reads it.
KATE	We answered every question withJake Ryan. 
EMILY	Yep. This marked the birth of the “I Love Jake Club.”  Tom, still scrolling through Jamie’s feed, looks up.
KATE	Widen her circle?
TOM	I love who?
KATE	Jake Ryan from “Sixteen Candles.”  That was our movie. God, Jake Ryan. He was the perfect guy.
EMILY	And to join our club you had to answer a sex questionnaire like in the movie.
KATE	The club had two presidents. And two members.
ANDREW	You started a club and you were the only members. That’s sad.
KATE	What clubs did you guys start?
ANDREW	Let me see these questions.
EMILY	I googled him. Do you know there are no recent pictures. Not one. Turns out he quit acting like years ago and moved to rural  Pennsylvania to make furniture.
TOM	So he’s like Amish now?
ANDREW	Works with his hands. pretty hot. That’s
KATE	Yeah, you two can’t be in the club.
TOM	You wanna watch a little John Oliver?
EMILY	Nah.
EMILY	Do you mind doing Amelia’s drop off tomorrow morning so I can work out?
TOM	No fucking way! 
EMILY	What?
AMELIA	Mommeeeeee!
EMILY	It’s okay, honey.  Mommy’s here.
EMILY	You should go pee pee first.Remember what happened last time?
KATE	Did you really just tell me to go  pee pee? I don’t haveto. I’ve come prepared.
KATE	This thing is tight as fuck.
EMILY	That is so wrong.
KATE	Try pushing out two more kids and see if you don’t need one.
KATE	Hey- what’s going on with you? it Tom stuff again?
EMILY	No. Yes.
KATE	You guys seemed alright last night. Please tell me you went home and had drunk sex?
EMILY	Hardly. He has like zero interest. Forget sex. The last hug I got was from teacher Sherry.
EMILY	I might have felt a tingle.
KATE	We need to talk about this!
EMILY	Dinner tonight?
CLAUDE	Alright ladies, knees to cheeks!
KATE	Good thing this is an “overnite”!
EMILY	Good timing. Kate’s picking me up inminutes.
TOM	I texted with Andrew. I’m taking the kids over there to hang for a bit.
EMILY	You sure you want to do that on a school night?
EMILY	If Wyatt falls asleep on the way back he won’t transfer.
TOM	It’s gonna be great, Em. will have fun.  Fun.
EMILY	What a concept. The kids
TOM	Hey, let’s not do the “we don’t have fun anymore” thing. I’m baby- sitting tonight so you can go and have fun!
EMILY	Tom, it’s not baby-sitting when it’s your own kids. Don’t forget this okay? You’ll need it.
EMILY	And Wyatt’s green blankie is in the dryer. You can’t forget that. Are you listening?
TOM	I got it. Diaper bag. Blankie.
TOM	I’m just gonna go take a quick shower.
EMILY	Good luck with that.
MELANIE	Looks like your classic ambush move. That Emily is sneaky. I like her.
KATE	Tell me you didn’t do this.
EMILY	I kind of did.
KATE	I thought this was going to be just the two of us talking about you and Tom and shitty life stuff.
EMILY	I know. I’m sorry. I didn’t want to come alone. You’re my best friend. Always will be, but I need, you know, a few more just regular friends in my life.
KATE	Well, I don’t.
EMILY	Come on, what about “It takes a village” and all that?. 
KATE	Let me tell you about my village.It’s a desert island and the  things I would take there are you, some Stills & Nash, and--
EMILY	Bug spray. We’ll definitely need  bug spray on the island. For the Zika and the West Nile and--
KATE	See, that’s why you’re my village! You think of everything. Third item is a robust marijuana plant, by the way.	 
EMILY	Of course it is. Sorry I tricked you. I just wanted to have a night out and not think about Tom for a few hours. I need it. 
MELANIE	Hey, two of us at our table for four are ready to order. Are you two done telling secrets out here? I’ve started eating stale fruit snacks from the bottom of my bag.
KATE	One hour. That’s it. fucking owe me. 
JAMIE	...I just can’t get Lexie to touch a single vegetable with the exception of jicamTurns out my girl loves jicam
EMILY	Well what else is there to bring for snack share anyway? We’ve got what,kids allergic to gluten. A  soy.tree nuts and the zipper kid.
MELANIE	That kid is not allergic to  zippers.
JAMIE	He’s just scared of them. It’smore of an emotional allergy.
MELANIE	... Did ROTC thing in college and came this close to joining the  armed forces. Still think about it. You can not get me out of my ‘tigues on the weekends.
EMILY	...I loved telling people at  parties I was a lawyer. Except I never went to parties because I wasat the office until . And then on one of the rare nights I got home before bedtime, Amelia called our nanny “Mam”
JAMIE	Don’t get me wrong. Even though the separation was the right thing, it was terrifying at first. Being alone. Alone in the house. Alone in here... Alone down there...
MELANIE	Hey, every va-gine needs a little alone time.
JAMIE	But now it’s pretty okay. I actually have free time when Lexie is with Theo, so I started consulting for an engineering group. Plus I’ve started training for a half marathon and I get to sleep, like really sleep.
EMILY	No wonder you look amazing.
JAMIE	Thanks. You know, she would never admit it, but Melanie was a saving grace for me. After my separation, some of my friends got weird. You would not believe how, once you’re  single, ladies do not want youaround their husbands. I never saw that coming from friends.
MELANIE	The nerve, right? And like she would want any of their shitty husbands anyway.
JAMIE	Not this one though. She invited me to everything. I mean, she used brute physical force to get me out of the house sometimes.
KATE	That I believe.
MELANIE	Oh she speaks! Okay, Kate, what  should we talk about?
MELANIE	You know, so we’re interesting toyou? We’ve all shared. What’s your deal? Let’s finally hear it tonight.
EMILY	Melanie, don’t you think that’s a little harsh?
MELANIE	No, I don’t actually. All due respect, but she cannot wait to be rid of us.
MELANIE	Tell me: How drunk do you have to  get to endure this dinner?
EMILY	She’s just... got a lot on her plate with four kids and--
KATE	It’s alright Emily. I can speak for myself. It’s true, I didn’t want tobe here.
MELANIE	I knew it.
KATE	It’s nothing personal. I just don’t want any more mom friends.
MELANIE	What a bitch.
KATE	What can I say? I’m Mom’d out. First there were the moms from when Lucas started school. Then the Sam moms. More play dates, more school meetings. The juicing, the coffees. I’m over it. I don’t want to hear  what birthday parties are being planned. I don’t care who believes in time outs.
KATE	I don’t give a fuck about the best mommy and me yog Or mommy and me anything. And I especially don’t want to know that “super cute thing” their kid said or did or made or wrote or sang--Do you want me to go on?
JAMIE	I think we’ve got it. Just so you know, though: Melanie and I don’t juice.
MELANIE	I knew you were a bitch. I knew it. Jamie always says “She’s so cool.” You’re not cool. Do you know how much shit we do for the school? Of course you don’t. 
JAMIE	It’s true. Our upcoming auction is paying for the playtrium  renovation. I don’t know if you’venoticed how bad the rubber floors are but--
KATE	Guys, we pay enough tuition thatTeacher Sherry drives a brand new  BMW. She can fix her own fucking floors.
EMILY	That’s hers? The white five series always parked in front of school?
KATE	Melanie, you’re going to blink and  Grace will be in Kindergarten. Outof this school and onto  he next. Then what will you do? I mean, it seems to me like you’ve built your life around Happy Days. For what?
MELANIE	Don’t be patronizing. You can   laugh at me out there in the parking lot, but I keep our kids safe. There are a lot of sick motherfuckers out there. I am the last line of defense! You want me on that wall! ctually, I’m done here. This is bullshit. Let’s get the check.
EMILY	Melanie, please, stay. I’m glad  you’re our traffic safety person.I really am.
JAMIE	Yeah, Mel. You don’t want to miss the tartufo.
KATE	Melanie, I’m sorry, I know you don’t like me because I’m not all gung-ho and involved but--
MELANIE	No. My problem with you isn’t thatyou don’t do shit, while the rest  of us are doing the shit - it’s that you walk around like you’re too good to do any shit at all!
KATE	You took my phone yesterday for  fuck’s sake. My car wasn’t even moving! Just admit you take stuff a little too far?
MELANIE	When you admit that you weretexting and driving.

KATE	I was buying milk! run out of milk! A mother can’t
MELANIE	You know what? I’m not leaving. And I want my tartufo. And a scotch. I need a scotch with it. Then you’ve got your sweet and you’ve got something to cut the sweet. This is MY dinner. She should leave.
KATE	With pleasure.
EMILY	But I drove with her!
JAMIE	This isn’t good, Mel. We all have to see each other at school tomorrow. And for the rest of the year.
MELANIE	Fine. Fine. I can’t believe I’m missing “Forensic Files” for this shit.
MELANIE	Order me that scotch.
KATE	Don’t bother trying to convince me to come back in.
MELANIE	Don’t worry. I was planning on waiting a minute and then telling them I couldn’t find you. Oh well.
KATE	Good.
MELANIE	What the hell is that?
KATE	Something you could use desperately. 
MELANIE	Mary Jane? Huh. I used to enjoy the dubage from time to time. How I loved me a blunt...Yeah, I’ll toke up. Why not? You’re still a massive cunt though.
KATE	Guessing it’s been a while?
MELANIE	 years or so.
KATE	Here’s how it works in the st century: You push this down.
MELANIE	Kate, maybe there is more to you than just being an asshole.
KATE	Wait. I’m confused. Am I a cunt or am I an asshole? There’s a big difference you know.
MELANIE	True. Although sometimes in the ark my husband can’t tell.
JAMIE	So you just need to choose the picture then --
EMILY	Wow, Jamie, your type font is huge!
JAMIE	Oh, just you wait. Hit the forties and you start going blind. That’s what I’ve been told.
EMILY	You matched with someone!
JAMIE	Yikes. Nope. I don’t think I’m ready for this yet. Dating at this age? The men all seem scary to me. They all look like grungy lumberjacks.
EMILY	It’s fun to look though, right? Just start by looking.
EMILY	They’ve been gone kind of a long time.
JAMIE	Uh huh.
EMILY	Do you know anything about a fight club in the Helping Hand yard?
JAMIE	What?
EMILY	Forget it.
MELANIE	Um, we’re gonna need a bigger boat. Yes. each.
KATE	We'll take one more... of
TOM	So glad we did this. And Emily acted like it was going to be so hard bringing the kids over here.
ANDREW	Kate gets uptight like that too. Pay no mind.
TOM	What’s wrong little guy?
AMELIA	He wants his blankie.
TOM	Oh... Fuck.
JAMIE	Marijuana can make me really paranoid so I’m gonna pass. 
KATE	Okay then. Em, your turn.
EMILY	Can you guys believe this is the same Kate Jonas who made a “don’t fall for peer pressure” PSA in th grade?
MELANIE	So you were a nerd. that. I like knowing
KATE	You owe me, Em. Come on. Tonight is about having some fun, right?
EMILY	I’ll take one puff.
JAMIE	I just love this little pen thingie. It’s so visually striking. I guess I can try a little bit too. Why not?.
JAMIE	It’s stuck or something.
KATE	Shit. It ran out of oil. Not to worry. I have a joint we can spark up.
MELANIE	Jah Mon.
KATE	There’s something so classic about a perfectly rolled joint. It’s like Jennifer Grey before the nose job.
JAMIE	Sort of like how every now and then, I go back to basics and get a classic Brazilian bikini wax.
KATE	Brazilians are retro now?
JAMIE	Not even. They’re totally out. There are all of these new styles. It’s really an emerging art form. Right now I have a Helipad.
MELANIE	What the fuck is a Helipad?
JAMIE	A circle. A dot really.
MELANIE	What are we talking here, Ash Wednesday? A quarter, a dime, what?
KATE	It looks like a Thin Mint cookie.
JAMIE	This is the craziest thing though: Vajazzling. Check this out.
MELANIE	So, women get their pussies bedazzled with colored crystals? Holy lord.
EMILY	What is this one?
JAMIE	It’s a palm tree on a sandy beach. See the seagull over there?
MELANIE	What the hell kind of woman chooses to put sand on her vagina?
HANNAH	What are you doing in there? a lot of feet. I see
MELANIE	Well, aren’t you cute in your outfit. Is it your birthday?
HANNAH	Are you smoking in there? My mom says that only people with weak resolves do that.
MELANIE	Your mom is very smart. We’re all moms too in here so, of course, we aren’t smoking.
HANNAH	What are you doing then?
EMILY	Cooking.
JAMIE	Spraying perfume.
MELANIE	Nothin.
KATE	Burning a little incense.
HANNAH	I think the manager would like to know what’s going on in here.
JAMIE	Hey, wait! How ‘bout we send an ice cream sundae over to your table? Like a little prize for keeping the secret?
HANNAH	I want a steak.
JAMIE	Done.
HANNAH	New York Strip. Medium rare.
HANNAH	And a coke.
JAMIE	Fine.
KATE	Wow. Little girls are fucking intense. Is that what I’m missing out on cause, “no thanks.”
EMILY	Oh my God. Did we do this?
MELANIE	I believe we did. We should get the hell out of here before that little “Shining” girl rats us out.
JAMIE	Let’s go through the back. We don’t want to get caught in here.
EMILY	Should we go around front and see what’s happening?
MELANIE	That’s a negative, Emily. Smoking a little marijuana is a misdemeanor, but smoking it in a restaurant and setting off the fire alarm. Now that’s FUBAR.
EMILY	I can’t believe this.
JAMIE	You guys... I’m starting to feel a little weird. 
MELANIE	Ladies, I believe this is a dine and dash situation. Let’s move out!
MELANIE	Looks like we’re staying out a bit longer. I’m gonna text the hub.
KATE	Good ide Em, I’ll text Andrew. He can tell Tom.
MELANIE	Hey, does anyone mind if we make a quick pit-stop in here? I love me some Walgreen’s.
MELANIE	You can all pick out something ...on me!
KATE	OMG, I haven’t been in one of these in years.
TOM	Look, Wy, it’s green just like your blankie.
WYATT	Mam
TOM	Think we have to go, man.
AMELIA	Daddy you promised I could watch it!Please! Please! Pleaaaassseee. It’s almost over!
ANDREW	Hey, come with me. I’ve got an ide
KATE	Here’s our car. I sprang for the SUV, coz I’m a bad-ass bitch like that.
EMILY	Why did you get us a car?
MELANIE	No. That’s good thinking. Let the crime scene cool out. Leave our cars there to deflect. Hooah, Katie!You got our .
KATE	I have no fucking idea what you’re saying. FUBAR? ?
MELANIE	Military jargon. Fucked Up Beyond All Repair.is back. You’ve got our back.
KATE	Roger that, you crazy cunt.
JAMIE	You guys, I have a bad feeling about getting in these things. You hear about these guys...
JAMIE	...they drive all day then pick up that last ride and just snap...
DRIVER	Ladies, ladies. There will be no snapping tonight. You’re safe with me.
JAMIE	Oh my god, you guys, it’s a female driver.
EMILY	So. Fucking. Rad.
DRIVER	I know right? Aww, look at you back there. Goddamit, you’re my target demographic. Check it
DRIVER	Help yourselves, chickens.
DRIVER	I’m Bobbi. And you are? 
EMILY/KATE/MELANIE/JAMIE Emily, Kate, Melanie, Jamie.
BOBBI	Yeah, it’s not always possible, but I try, wherever I can, to pick up only ladies and children.
MELANIE	Is that allowed?
BOBBI	We gotta take down the patriarchy  one ride at a time, amiright,Kate?
KATE	Preach!
EMILY	Isn’t that discriminatory?
BOBBI	Emily, please. Do you have any idea what it’s like picking up drunk, smelly dudes at night when you have this face and body?
JAMIE	There’s that white van again! No windows.
JAMIE	Everyone knows the only people who drive white vans are rapists and/or serial killers.
KATE	And/or FedEx.
MELANIE	You weren’t joshin’ when you said  you got paranoid.
JAMIE	I know. And the problem is I always had Theo when I got high.He took care of me when I started getting like this. I’d just give him this look and he’d know. He was... my person.
KATE	I’ll be your person, Jamie. Don’t worry. I’ve got you, girl.
BOBBI	Oh, you don’t have to worry about rapists when Ole Bibbidy Bobbidy Boo’s at the wheel. See what I got up here?
BOBBI	Anyone fucks with us? They’re toast. Literally. This here’s Dolly. Y’all want a demonstration? Sure,
EMILY	maybe once we get there.
MELANIE	Amazing.
JAMIE	STOP THAT NOW!
EMILY	Aaaaaahhhhhh.
KATE	WHAT IS HAPPENING?
EMILY	How many men have you used that on?
BOBBI	Not many.tops. Maybe . I’ve got another way to clear the vehicle if I’m getting bad vibes off a bro.
MELANIE	Oh. My. God.
MELANIE	Bobbi, you are one awesome and sick fuck. You are getting the -star rating tonight.
ANDREW	May I?
TOM	Andrew, what the--
ANDREW	Trust me. I have of these.
ANDREW	Hey little guy. You’re gonna dig this.
ANDREW	Next time, a soft, fuzzy blanket would be better than this piece-of- shit towel. No offense.
TOM	Well, I forgot his blanket. And that’s your shitty towel. No offense.
ANDREW	It’s disgusting.
TOM	Yeah maybe your next investment can be in some decent towels.
TOM	Okay that’s fucking incredible.
KATE	If I’m staying out with you gals, I need more supplies.
JAMIE	I better stay out here. with that stuff. I’m done
KATE	No. We’re all sticking together. Like sister wives. Don’t worry. This place is like a Crabtree and Evelyn, but with weed.
WAYNE	Ladies. I’m Wayne, your marijuana sommelier for this evening and this is my partner Brady.
BRADY	You need it, we have it...or we find it, or we grow it, or we get it.
WAYNE	This is the stuff we get special for the mothers. We love the mothers.
EMILY	How do they know we’re mothers?
WAYNE	Here’s our Ruth Bader Ganj Now  don’t get me wrong this will getyou supremely high - but you’ll still be clear headed enough to make decisions, resolve the family disputes, what have you.
MELANIE	Ruthie’s got some nice buds.
BRADY	Ruth is also great for building Lego shit. Total concentration.
WAYNE	Then you’ve got Mary Jane Goodall. She’s perfect for bonding with your little monkeys-- use this one when you’re breast-feeding and you’re holding ‘em close to the bosom...
KATE	None of us are breast-feeding, Wayne, but thanks. Can we talk edibles instead?
BRADY	Okay, absolutely. see... Edibles. Let me 
BRADY	Good Night Moons. I would share these. Like just a few bites or it can get kinda trippy. But say the kids are away on a sleep over, then by all means, dig in. Little Rocky Road scooped on one of these. That’s gonna be good times.
JAMIE	This is delicious!
KATE	Jamie, there are no free samples!
JAMIE	It looked so blue!
BRADY	That’s cool. It’s one of our very own, original blue balls. They’re intense.
WAYNE	What’s funny?
ANDREW	Holy crap. Kate is actually partying with the school moms!
TOM	What?
ANDREW	It’s on the bubble bath chick’s Instagram.
TOM	It really is embarrassing that you follow her.
ANDREW	I know. And she doesn’t follow me back.
TOM	I just gave Amelia a five minute warning. 
ANDREW	Grab the door!
ANDREW	I think we’re locked out for the moment.
TOM	What do you mean for the moment?
ANDREW	It’s fine. That door sometimes locks. I need to fix it. There’s a spare key around here somewhere.
ANDREW	We’ve got one of those fake poop things that hides a key. Relax. Let the kids finish the movie.
TOM	Alright. I just wanted to get the kids home before Emily got back.
ANDREW	Kate texted. They’re staying out later. (Then) I think I was supposed to tell you.
JAMIE	I haven’t licked a ball in adecade. 
MELANIE	And cut to your divorce.
JAMIE	Do not tell me you guys still blow your husbands? I never blew Theo. Maybe like for a minute on his birthday.
MELANIE	Again, your divorce.
KATE	Sometimes it’s just easier. A quick one during a commercial break of Kimmel? Andrew’s psyched and I don’t have to have him lying all over me.
MELANIE	I hear that sist My preference is “Antiques Roadshow.” No commercials, but I only miss one Ming Dynasty elephant, tops.
JAMIE	Lord. Well, just imagine being single again. It’s all back on the table for me now.
JAMIE	What if I have to do anal again?
EMILY	Again?
KATE	Oh my sweet, sweet Emily.
JAMIE	I have never felt more alone than when that was happening to me. Ugh, like a serrated knife and I’m the loaf of bread.
MELANIE	Look at it like this, Jamie. Maybe you’ll meet the man who makes you want to do anal.
EMILY	Thank God I never did.
KATE	Emily’s one of those angels whomarried the first guy she slept  with.
MELANIE	No fucking way!
EMILY	Well, almost the first. I was young and foolish.
JAMIE	You guys, I think we’re being followed.
KATE	Jamie, you’ve had one too many licks. It’s all good. No one is following us.
JAMIE	Don’t look! Don’t look. Shhh. Listen.
EMILY	Jamie honey, we’re in town. On a sidewalk. So its normal for people to be walking on it.
KATE	How about we go get a drink over there? Cool out a bit? You think that would help, Jam--
MELANIE	We’ve got a runner!
JAMIE	Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
JAMIE	Good lord. Your bone structure.
LUKE	Thank you. How bout a Coke?
JAMIE	Oh, but I was gonna order a Vodka tonic. Because it’s transparent. So if some perv tries to slip something in it I’m gonna see.
LUKE	How bout a Sprite then? 
MELANIE	Glenlivit for me, sir. up. Thank you muchly. Straight
EMILY	She and I will do a house white.
LUKE	Let me guess: mom’s night out.
EMILY	Should I be offended that you  immediately pinned us as moms?
LUKE	Hell no.
EMILY	It says MomS.
LUKE	I’ve got two of ‘em. Nice eye. Not everyone’s such a close reader.
EMILY	I’m good with the fine print. It’s a lawyer thing. I’m Emily by the way.
LUKE	Luke.
EMILY	Ah this is your place.
PERTURBED PATRON	Little help over here?
KATE	Em, what’s gotten into you? Drugs! I’m sorry I tricked you into coming.
KATE	Hate to admit it but I’m actually having a good time.
EMILY	It’s kind of a perfect night, right?
KATE	We just need Jake Ryan here to share it with us.
JAMIE	Oh. I lovvveeed him. Sixteen Candles!
MELANIE	Personally, I was more into Anthony Michael Hall. Farmer Ted? What? I find the little guys very sexy.
JAMIE	No. Jake Ryan. He was the ideal. He, like, ruined romance for me.
EMILY	So true. No guy ever lived up to him. Or ever will.
MELANIE	That’s because he’s a character in a movie.
JAMIE	What ever happened to that guy?
EMILY	Forget it. I tried. There’s not a single recent picture of him. Not one. He’s like the JD Salinger of teen heart throbs.
JAMIE	It must be a conspiracy.
LUKE	I always loved “Some Kind of Wonderful.”
EMILY	Oh, that was a great one! So romantic. Eric Stoltz and Leah Thompson.
LUKE	Nope. It was Eric Stoltz and Mary Stuart Masterson.
EMILY	Oh, you’re right. You’re right! Mary Stuart had that killer haircut.
KATE	Check you out.
EMILY	Don’t judge.
KATE	I’m not. A little male attention might be just what you need tonight.
ANDREW	Here. Try this. I have a little micro-brewery set up in the basement. I tried a hint of smoked bacon in this batch. What do you think?
TOM	Hmmm. Not sure I’m getting bacon. What’s that thing where they ferment a fish in Sweden?
ANDREW	I’m still working on the ratio of hops to malt. It’s a very delicate balance.
TOM	So that’s it? We’re gonna sit here, maybe locked out, and look at this chick’s Instagram for the rest of the night?
ANDREW	Hey, chill out. It’s gonna be ok.
TOM	You know in the history of people telling people to “chill out,” nobody has ever “chilled out.”
ANDREW	The kids are right in there. It’s fine.
TOM	No. No, it’s not. Because I have to go to work in the morning. You know, not all of us luck into stock options on our first job and get to sit around masturbating in a home office the rest of our life.
ANDREW	Hey I don’t-- well sometimes.
TOM	Jesus Christ. I was kidding.
ANDREW	Not sure where this hostile energy is coming from, but I’m gonna let it go.
ANDREW	Look at what a nice time the girls are having.
TOM	(off phone) Did you know Emily was actually duping Kate into that dinner with the moms? I didn’t.
ANDREW	Well, looks like they’re both having fun.
TOM	Emily sure looks like she’s having fun.
ANDREW	Hey man. It’s nothing. They’re drunk and, if I know my wife, very stoned. Looks like she’s just ordering drinks. 
TOM	She’s got this thing though. About the fucking fun? That we don’t have fun together any more.
TOM	I just got the bacon.
ANDREW	Is that true? About the fun?
TOM	Well, I’m pretty stressed out--
ANDREW	No shit.
TOM	Yeah well I’m running projects for the firm right now. I’m on the fucking phone all day dealing with building codes and contractors and asshole clients instates.
ANDREW	Fuck.
TOM	Yeah. So when I’m finally home I don’t want to deal. With anyone. Her. I don’t want to talk or-- It’s definitely not the high point of our relationship.
ANDREW	If it makes you feel any better, man, without pot a couple of nights a week, Kate and I are basically brother and sister.
TOM	We gave that up when we had kids.
ANDREW	That was a mistake. This is when  you need it most, man. Look, it’sall normal. I have a boy’s foot in my face like every morning.
ANDREW	We’re so fucking tired all the time. I sometimes nap when I shit.
TOM	Really?
ANDREW	Yes. I know that sounds like a joke, but it’s no joke. I literally can fall asleep on the toilet.
TOM	I am not joking. I want you to teach me that. 
ANDREW	This’ll sound weird, but I will teach you to nap while you shit. You gotta cut yourselves a break, for now, while you’re still in the trenches with the kids so young. You have to laugh at this shit instead of getting angry at each other.
TOM	You’re saying we should lower the  bar?
ANDREW	Yeah, a bit.
ANDREW	At this point Kate and I are just trying to stay kind of into each other like maybe - months of the year, all while keeping the kids alive and teaching them to be semi- decent humans.
TOM	Do you mean two or three months throughout the year or consecutively?
JAMIE	This is fucking delicious.
JAMIE	Strange. I’m getting an awful lot of likes from my #rosebudding post. New friend requests too. Weird  ones. HardButtz, Buttking,AssMeAnything...
MELANIE	Let me see the post.
MELANIE	Um, do you know what “rosebudding” is, Jame? Delete the post immediately and do not accept any of those requests...trust me.
MELANIE	Jesus, your font is huge. A drone could read your texts.
KATE	It’s my mother-in-law.
MELANIE	Do not answer it and kill this sweet buzz.
KATE	Never.
JAMIE	Once, Theo, his mom and I were watching a movie together on the couch. It was dark and as I was rubbing Theo’s back and shoulders, I touched something. It was his  mom’s hand! She was rubbing his fucking back, too. We were both massaging him.
KATE	That’s sick. What is it with mothers and their sons? Andrew’s mom acts like a little school girlwith a crush around him. It’s so weird.
MELANIE	Well, here’s what I’ve figured out ladies and it’s not a pretty picture: We are going to be just like our mothers-in-laws.
KATE	No way.
MELANIE	Well, I know I’m gonna be all over my William. I can tell already. I love him so much. Fuck his wife. I raised him. I’ve earned it.
KATE	Well, try having four of them. As far as I’m concerned they can move in with their future wives any time now.
MELANIE	You say that now, but mark my words, we will all be inappropriately massaging our grown sons.
MELANIE	See this one, I got it fighting my mother-in-law over who was making the cranberry sauce last  Thanksgiving. The woman’s got lifeless eyes, black eyes, American Girl Doll Jess McConnell’s eyes.
KATE	Jersey shore. ‘. Andrew’s mom stepped on me with her old lady jelly mules. She was trying to  be first to lay out his beach towel.
JAMIE	Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I’m going to need to shut this account down and start a new one. That. Is. Sick.
ANDREW	Boy, I love Halloween candy.
TOM	It’s only September. stock up early, huh? You guys
ANDREW	Us? We’re last minute everything types. This is the kids’.  (off Tom’s confused look)From last year. See it takes like a  good three months for them toforget about it and that’s when I start to horde it for nights like this.
TOM	Brilliant.

ANDREW	I’m gonna share something with you now, Tom. It’s gonna help with your Emily situation. It’s an easy trick I like to call “Two C’s a Day.” C’s?
TOM	What? Two
ANDREW	Two C’s. C’s are compliments. compliments a day. That’s it.
TOM	You give Kate two compliments a day?
ANDREW	Uh-huh. Two times every day I say  something nice. I usually do a “C” about how she looks, what she’s wearing, something like that. Then the other one is an appreciation compliment. Like, “Babe, I don’t know how you do it all. You’re amazing.”
ANDREW	I’m telling ya man, it’s that simple. I never imagined how it would make my life so much easier.
TOM	Like how? Really?
ANDREW	‘Cause after I say something nice to her, she’s happy. Even better, she wants to do shit for me. She’s happy to do shit for me. I feel kind of guilty when I do it cause I get so much out of it.
TOM	Huh. So how did you figure this out?
ANDREW	We were having a fight, I think, and Kate told me that I don’t appreciate her enough and I  should try and say something nice to her every day. 
TOM	Wait a minute. Your big genius plan is something your wife told you to do?
ANDREW	Well she said one C. I upped it to two and I think that’s what perfected it. Two little sentences a day, man, and we live in harmony.
LUKE	Okay, come clean, “newbie.”
EMILY	Whatever do you mean?
LUKE	You were obviously an extra in “Cocktail.”
EMILY	Close. I ‘tended summer of ‘ at the Yacht Club on Lake Michigan.
EMILY	Our signature drink: Summer at the Shore.
LUKE	That’s a very nice G & T. You make this for your husband when he comes through the door?
EMILY	Not lately.
EMILY	Don’t tell me. Not again. I’ll kill them.
LUKE	It’s Karaoke hour!
LUKE	This one’s for friends.  You’re on!
EMILY	You nailed it.
LUKE	It’s a gift.
HOLLY	Time to shine girls!
EMILY	Neunundneunzig Luftballons Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont Hielt man für UFO’s aus dem all Darum schickte ein general
KATE	‘ne fliegerstaffel hinterher Alarm zu geben, wenn’s so war 
KATE/EMILY	Dabei war’n dort am Horizont Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons.
MELANIE	Gimme some English you fucking Nazis.
MELANIE	Ninety-nine decision street Ninety-nine ministers meet To worry, worry, super-scurry Call the troops out in a hurry This is what we’ve waited for This is it, boys, this is war he president is on the line As ninety-nine red balloons go by
EMILY/KATE/MELANIE/JAMIE	Ninety-nine knights of the air Ride super high tech jet fighters Everyone’s a superhero Everyone’s a Captain Kirk With orders to identify, to clarify and classify Scramble in the summer sky As ninety-nine red balloons go by...As ninety-nine red balloons go byyyyyyyyyyyyy....... Daddy!
AMELIA	Why are you outside?
LUCAS	We’re hungry. Can we have a snack, dad? A good snack? A mom’s-not- home snack?
AMELIA	I want a snack too.
ANDREW	Let me just grab the spare key.
ANDREW	Uh-oh.
TOM	What?
ANDREW	This is real poop.
TOM	You’re kidding me. So now we’re really locked out? All of us?
ANDREW	More scary is that we don’t have a dog.
ANDREW	Where is that fake pile of shit?
TOM	This is so not good.
ANDREW	Don’t worry. This is gonna be fun.  A parenting crisis is when I do my best work. Let the adventure begin! Here’s the deal, kids: The bad news is we’re locked out of the house until mom gets home...but the good news is... we’ve got candy!
EMILY	So what is this quick, little errand we’re going on?
LUKE	Truth? I just like to walk sometimes. You know, take a break from the bar. Breathe some fresh air.
EMILY	Yeah, it is a nice night. breeze.
LUKE	You’re cute. And you’re smart too.  I like that. I usually take mybreaks alone, but I had a  feeling about you tonight. Thanks for coming with. Sure.
EMILY	Good
LUKE	Don’t say anything. nasty habit. I know. It’s a
EMILY	Please. Before I got pregnant, I would sneak a cigarette at night with a glass of wine. (sighs) Itwas great. 
LUKE	Well, it’s just the two of us out here if you want to relive your glory days. I won’t tell.
EMILY	Nah, I can’t. It’s been years.
LUKE	I guess you can’t smoke a cig while you’re pushing a stroller down the street, right? (Pause) It’s kinda ’s sexy though.
EMILY	You’re funny.
LUKE	You don’t happen to have a light,  do you?
EMILY	Sorry...So, do you have kids?been married? Ever
LUKE	Nope. I came close...to both, but it never seemed to work with the lifestyle. Bar every night. Not conducive. Plus, I used to have  auditions every day.
EMILY	You were an actor?
LUKE	Yep. Gave the movie thing a go fora long time, but then I found my niche. Pharmaceutical commercials.
EMILY	Really?
LUKE	Oh yeah. I’m still seeing checks from a Type- Diabetes commercial I did in .
EMILY	That is so exciting.
LUKE	Yeah, it pays the bills.
LUKE	Enough about me, though. Your turn. So you’re a bartending lawyer? How long have you been married?
EMILY	Truth? I’ve been with my husband since college. Boring and predictable, right?
LUKE	Doesn’t have to be.
LUKE	You can spend some quality time with a successful, night-life entrepreneur, who happens to be a pretty good guy.
LUKE	Hey, this is my van. Hold up here a sec, I’m just gonna grab a lighter. 
AMELIA	This is pretty weird that we’re all laying in the car together.
TOM	But it’s kinda fun, too, right?
AMELIA	It’s... unexpected.
TOM	Where’d you get that word?
AMELIA	Mommy. It was a word of the day.
TOM	Mommy does a word of the day, huh?
AMELIA	Daddy, I’m cold and it smells like  Wyatt’s poop in here.
TOM	That’s what the terrible smell is!I thought it was Andrew.
AMELIA	You’re funny.
TOM	I’m sorry honey. It’s my fault we’re stuck out here. This wouldn’t happen on mommy’s watch. She takes good care of all of us, doesn’t she?
AMELIA	I like it when you’re the mommy too sometimes, daddy. 
MELANIE	Til now, I always got by on my own.I never really cared until I met you. But now it chills me to the bone. How do I get you alone...
JAMIE	She’s pretty incredible, isn’t she?
MELANIE	How do I get you alone. get you alone. Alone... How do I
KATE	Have you seen Emily? 
JAMIE	Bathroom, maybe? I’ll check.
JAMIE	Luke is gone too.
KATE	Did you see where Emily went?
MELANIE	Let me do a quick perimeter check.
KATE	Where’s Luke? He was here with my friend all night. Where did they go?
NEW BARTENDER	They split like twenty minutes ago or so. He said he’d be back but he also checked to make sure I could close up.
KATE	That doesn’t sound right. Emily wouldn’t leave without telling me. Where did they go?
NEW BARTENDER	He didn’t say.
KATE	I’m texting her.
JAMIE	I feel like something is wrong.
MELANIE	Jamie, you’ve felt like something’s wrong the whole damn night.
KATE	She’s not responding. Now I feel like something’s wrong, too.
MELANIE	OK. Listen to me. What’s your name?
NEW BARTENDER	Alfred.
MELANIE	Okay, Al. Tell me about Luke. Is this a regular thing for him? Leaving with a lady friend?
ALFRED	He’s done it before a few times, I guess.
MELANIE	Is that right? Good, Al. Cooperation is good. Now, you’re gonna call him and tell him he needs to come back with Emily right now, okay?
ALFRED	I can’t. He’ll be mad. kind of scary. And he’s
MELANIE	Al, you don’t know me. Jamie here knows me. Jamie, tell Al what I’m  like when I’m mad.
JAMIE	Call your boss, Alfred.
MELANIE	Al, you can cooperate or I can have the ATF here in the morning looking into this bar serving minors.
ALFRED	We don’t serve minors here.
MELANIE	You know they shut you down while they investigate a charge. Think Luke would like that?
ALFRED	What are you a cop?
MELANIE	Wanna find out?
MELANIE	Are we % sure that this is trouble? They were flirting all night.
KATE	I’m telling you. I know Emily.
JAMIE	Wait. I think I can track her iPhone! I was setting up stuff for her before. Hold on. Give me a sec.
KATE	Really? You can do that? Track somebody else’s phone?
JAMIE	Please. I can pretty much do anything on one of these.
MELANIE	Well?
ALFRED	Nope. No answer.
MELANIE	Where does he live?
MELANIE	Alfred! Tell me where the man lives.
JAMIE	Forget that. I have a read on her. She’s on Flanders Avenue heading south.
MELANIE	You’re sure about this Jamie? 
JAMIE	It’s her phone. Yes.
KATE	We have to go!
MELANIE	Okay. Ladies. This is really happening. Let’s move out.
JAMIE	Wait. Our cars are at the restaurant. Not that we’re in  shape to drive anyway.
BARRY	I can drive you guys. I’ve had nothing but five coconut waters tonight. (looking at Jamie) I’m Barry, by the way. Not sure we officially introduced ourselves.
MELANIE	Barry! Big points for you, Barry. Ladies, let’s move out!
JAMIE	Okay, now she’s off of Flanders and onto Cabot, heading west. Fuck.
MELANIE	Where’s he taking her?
JAMIE	I don’t know but I have terrible feeling he’s driving a white van.
KATE	Should I call Tom?
MELANIE	Do not call Tom. We do not know what we are dealing with yet.
KATE	You guys. You don’t know her. She would not leave with a strange guy.
MELANIE	Kate, I hate to say this, but they seemed pretty into each other.
JAMIE	They just went left on Atlantic, Barry. It looks like they’re heading to the marina district.
BARRY	Okey dokey.
KATE	I’m trying her again.
VOICE	Leave me the fuck alone already!
KATE	That was not her. She would never... Fuck! Was it her? 
MELANIE	OK, doesn’t matter. We are trackingher. We’re closing in and we are gonna get her out of whatever sitch she’s in. Barry, you need to step on it. I’ve been in golf carts faster than this.
BARRY	I’ve actually gothorsepower in this baby. And you wouldn’t believe the tight spots it fits in.
MELANIE	Just move this tiny motherfucker! This is Got her whether this is
KATE	my fault. I encouraged her. fucked up. Either way, she went willingly or not, on me.
JAMIE	The signal’s stopped at the marin
MELANIE	What is she doing at the marina?
JAMIE	You owe me an apology.
MELANIE	Okay, that’s fucking creepy.
KATE	Emily! Emily!
JAMIE	Damn it.
MELANIE	This could be Luke’s.
MELANIE	It’s locked. Barry, go feel the hoods of all of the parked cars. See if there are more warm ones. Don’t touch anything though. We want to preserve any evidence. Here, wear these. Hood’s warm.
JAMIE	I can’t get it to zero in any more. All I can tell is it’s somewhere over there. See the blue? That’s the ocean.
KATE	Emily! Emily!
MELANIE	Jesus H. Christ. Is that fucker taking her onto the water? Now I really don’t like this.
MELANIE	Zero Dark . It’s zero dark fucking . Mission is a go.
KATE	Holy shit!
JAMIE	Holy shit!
MELANIE	Holy mother of the Pope! That hurt so bad!
BARRY	That woman is certifiable.
KATE	No. She’s incredible. She’s got our ! She’s saving my friend. Wait. MY friend.
JAMIE	Kate! You can’t. You won’t make it. It’s too far away now!
MELANIE	Unbelievable!
KATE	Holy shit! It’s freezing! Where’d that hose come from?
MELANIE	Walgreen’s. It’s the Pocket Hose,  As Seen on TV. Expands tofeet.
MELANIE	I had it up inside my unicorn. Always wanted one.
MELANIE	You’re one gutsy bitch. I think you should consider co-chairing the spring auction with me.
KATE	Can we do this later! We need to find Emily.
MELANIE	I may have targeted the wrong vessel.
KATE	Ya think?
EMILY	It’s nice feeling like the old mefor a few hours, you know? Not mommy. Just Emily.
LUKE	Well, I’m diggin just Emily. 
EMILY	I can’t -- I mean, it was fun at the bar with you and, I, I, it’s been so long since anyone haskissed me like that, but I am  married and 
LUKE	Hey, it’s ok. You didn’t do anything.
EMILY	I kissed you.
LUKE	I kissed you back.
EMILY	I’m sorry. 
LUKE	For what? Stopping? You should be. That was getting good. EMILY	Funny. No, for kissing you, allowing you...
LUKE	Stop. Don’t be sorry. You needed it. It’s all good and I’m fine.  I’ve been a wake-up call for a few married women in my time. I don’t mind.
EMILY	Thanks, I guess. It’s late. My friends and I have an early wake up tomorrow. School night and all. We should get back.
LUKE	Okay, okay. Got it. (Pause) You should kiss your husband like that,  by the way.
TOM	I could really use a pint of your  bacon beer right now. That stuff really grew on me.
ANDREW	Totally. It would pair really well with this foot.
TOM	Could peanuts work? I love peanuts. A peanut beer. Is that a thing?
ANDREW	It is now! Inspired, Tom.
BARRY	Can you see anything?
JAMIE	Sort of but it’s so dark. I’ve lost sight of them.
BARRY	Well, I’m not worried. I bet your  friend has Luke hog-tied andbegging for mercy by now.
JAMIE	Let’s hope so. 
BARRY	You ladies are really something else. You’re all married, huh?
JAMIE	They are. I’m not. I’m divorced.
BARRY	Really? I mean, sorry. That’s too bad. Is it? Too bad? 
JAMIE	It’s better than being married to my ex.
BARRY	Good. I mean, that you’re happier.
JAMIE	Yes, yes. I am. (a beat) So Barry, what’s with you? Do you have a girlfriend?
BARRY	Nah, not right now. It’s scary out there. All the girls seems so...robust.
JAMIE	I know right? I think it’s pretty scary too. So, how’d you get stuck being the designated driver tonight?
BARRY	Oh, I volunteered. I don’t like to drink too much. Makes me feel weird in the head. I know this will sound corny, but I’m more of a homebody.
JAMIE	Me too!
BARRY	Like my ideal night is cooking a nice meal, cleaning up - I like to use a little Windex on the counters to make them shiny, you know? Then go watch some quality TV. 
JAMIE	Me too! What do you binge on?
BARRY	No, no, I eat healthy and watch my weight.
JAMIE	I mean binge watch. Amazon? Like Netflix,
BARRY	Oh I don’t have any of that stuff. I’m still just a regular old cable guy.
JAMIE	Oh, I love regular cable! Confession? I like to fall asleep  to HGTV. It soothes me.
BARRY	Oh my god! Me too! I fall asleep to “Love it or List it” almost every night.
JAMIE	That’s my favorite! They always choose to love it. Have you noticed that?
BARRY	Totally.
JAMIE	Can we take a picture?
BARRY	Sure.
JAMIE	You’re really quite photogenic.
BARRY	I know.
JAMIE	I think you’re an old soul Barry.
BARRY	An old soul? I like that. The last girl I dated thought of me more as a bashful predator.
EMILY	Where are my friends?
ALFRED	Looking for you. Those girls went ballistic. They thought Luke abducted you or something.
LUKE	What?
LUKE	I’m sure they’ll be back soon. Just hang out here.
EMILY	I need to call Kate. Fuck.
EMILY	It’s gone. My phone’s gone.
ALFRED	Here you go. 
EMILY	I don’t have her number. It’s in my phone!
ALFRED	You don’t know your friend’s phone number?
EMILY	Not by heart. Who knows anyone’s number anymore? Fucking technology!
KEVIN	Wait! I can call Barry!
LUKE	Who’s Barry?
EMILY	And who are you?
KEVIN	Barry’s our buddy. He drove the girls to look for you and I’m getting married on Saturday!
EMILY	Look for me where?
ALFRED	They were tracking your phone come to think of it.
EMILY	And I don’t have my phone so-- Oh fuck.
KATE	Well, Melanie, I’m waiting for it.
MELANIE	Waiting for what?
KATE	Two JAWS jokes tonight and then, out here, you’ve got nothing?
MELANIE	You’re right. Shit.
KATE	I have never felt so sober in my entire life. 
MELANIE	We should go find Jamie and Barry. Maybe they had more luck than we did.
MELANIE	It’s go time.
KATE	Right behind you.
JAMIE	Barry, you are kidding me with this.
BARRY	Hello, it’s Barry. Really? Emily’s at the bar.
JAMIE	What? Let me talk to her.
MELANIE	Nice aft.
KATE	If she came here willingly I’ll fucking kill her.
EMILY	Jamie!
JAMIE	There’s still no sign of them.
EMILY	I can’t believe this.
BARRY	There’s gotta be Marina security. I’m gonna go look and they’ll call in whoever to help.
JAMIE	Good thinking! Go!
EMILY	Jamie where did you last see them?
JAMIE	Out there.
MELANIE	Alright, where the fuck is Emily!
JAMES	Hey, no trespassing! boat!  Get off my
MELANIE	Your boat? I’m sorry, Matey, going to have to see your license and registration.
KATE	Mel - let’s just go. Emily’s not here.
JAMES	It’s my Dad’s boat. to leave. And I need you
OLIVIA	Bae, be nice. They’re homeless.
KATE	We are not homeless.
OLIVIA	You must be hungry.
KATE	I am pretty hungry, actually.
MELANIE	Not the right time, Kate.
MELANIE	What exactly is going on here? We heard someone scream.
ZOE	Tomorrow’s senior skip. So we’re having a party. The scream was me. My vine just hit , views.
MELANIE	This is a party? Don’t bullshit me.
JAMIE	Melanie!
EMILY	Oh my god! We found you. We saw your Janimal hanging out there.
KATE	Em! Hall-e-lu-jah!
KATE	Where the fuck were you?
EMILY	I was just out walking with Luke. I’m so sorry. I lost my phone.
JAMIE	We may have jumped the gun with Operation: Rescue Emily.
EMILY	I can’t believe you did all of this to save me.
ALEX	What are these old-ass people doing on the boat, James? Wait. here.
JAMIE	It’s here! Your phone is
JAMIE	Call it.
ZOE	That’s a coincidence.
MELANIE	So is this some kind of a bling ring shit happening here? Stealing phones for the black market?
KATE	Oh yeah. I’ve seen this kind of thing on “Lock Up.”
OLIVIA	So what? Zoe lifts shit. It’s her thing. Everybody’s got a thing.
DYLAN	Yeah. I catfish rich dudes.
ALEX	I pull fire alarms.
OLIVIA	I’m a Youtube unboxer.
ALEX	Butt stuff.
JAMIE	Theft is really serious though, guys. (to Alex) And I wanna talk about the fire alarm thing later. Zoe, you could get in real trouble for this.
ZOE	Look, I steal. I’m sorry. I can’t help myself. All week I’ve been studying for the SATS, working on college essays. We have to be so fucking responsible. If I don’t get all A’s, my parents will  murder me. It just feels like... good once in a while to do something... wrong.
KATE	You spoiled little brats. You know what I did to let off steam in high school? I drank a six pack of peach wine coolers behind Sal’s Pizzeri I didn’t steal.
JAMIE	We should call the police.
MELANIE	Hold on. Zoe, you’re what? ?
ZOE	I’ll bein two months.
MELANIE	An adult. Whose prints are all over these phones. Prison isn’t an episode of “Orange is the New Black”, Zoe. No one’s gonna be cutting and braiding your hair all day. Wanna write about that experience for your college essay?
ZOE	(verge of tears) Please don’t turn me in. Please.
EMILY	News flash. Life is hard. It’s work. I know being the bad girl feels fun in the moment. But, that moment’s over quick. And the only feeling you’re left with is regret.
EMILY	You know what a shitty feeling that is? It’s not worth risking everything for.
ZOE	Yeah. Maybe you’re right. Sorry.
EMILY	Okay then. We believe in second chances right, ladies?
BARRY	Fuuuuuuu...dge.
MELANIE	Screentime is over people! You’re all getting a consequence for Zoe’s shenanigans.
OLIVIA	You can’t do that!
JAMES	Hey, I was in the middle of a  Snapchat story!
MELANIE	You’ll all be technology free for the next hour.
MELANIE	Now, let’s kill this electronica shit and get some Peabo Bryson up in here.
MELANIE	Now, you are all going to experience the extreme social awkwardness we had to deal with at parties back in the day! You gotta face each other in the flesh without a phone filtering those big oily teenager pores!
KATE	C’mon, your palms should be sweating up a storm! 
DYLAN	I’ve got one. Never have I ever... walked in on my parents doing it.
JAMES	Dude, nasty.
ZOE	On a family vacation in Jamaic
MELANIE	Still have PTSDyears later.
KATE	Ready... Never have I ever... had lice.
JAMIE	Give it another few weeks at Happy Days, Em. I have a special comb I’ll lend you.
OLIVIA	I’m so never having kids.
EMILY	Never have I ever... kissed a guy who wasn’t my husband.
KATE	Emily!
MELANIE	Who
EMILY	I stopped it. It was a mistake. Total mistake. (she pauses) I wanted Tom to talk to me like that, look at me like that. I need to tell him tomorrow.
MELANIE	Are you sure?
EMILY	I’m terrified. But it’s time to get honest. Tonight made me realize that I want my marriage to work. I want Tom.
JAMIE	Then fight for it, sweetie.
JAMIE	Never have I ever cheated on my husband with an old boyfriend from high school.
JAMIE	Fucking Social Medi
MELANIE	How did I not know this? I thought Theo...
JAMIE	Everyone thought that, but it was me. My life is a sham. I only post the pretty stuff. Hashtag big fucking liar.
MELANIE	Never have I ever dressed up my husband’s dick as Napolean.
JAMIE	Wait. What?
MELANIE	Remember last year when Peter and I went on that Alaskan cruise? We didn’t. We went to a couples sex retreat! To reconnect.
EMILY	And...?
JAMIE	Seriously?
KATE	Did it work?
MELANIE	We had “assignments” to get back in touch with our privates. One night, we dressed up Peter’s penis as Napolean. Did a little one-act. It actually worked. We still do it. Here look.
KATE	Is that supposed to be Willie Nelson?
EMILY	Can I get the info for this place?
JAMIE	Where does one get a bandana that small?
KATE	Never have I ever had any real mom friends.
JAMIE	You guys are soaking wet. Aren’t you freezing? Thank god Em and I didn’t have to get in that water.
KATE	Fuck, I have to make lunches.
EMILY	Ow. Ow. Ow.
KATE	If I ever do that again I’m getting a god damn epidural first.
MELANIE	You know, the CIA should use that shit on the terrorists.
JAMIE	You’re all a bunch of wimps.
MELANIE	(removes hand from pants) I’m already regretting my choice. Should I have gone with the Mt. Rushmore? Peter loves history.
EMILY	Oh, he’s gonna love it.
KATE	Emily. Turn around.
EMILY	What?
KATE	Just turn around!
EMILY	(mouthing)
TOM	Me? Yeah you.
EMILY	You did this.
KATE	Swear. All Tom. Nope.
MELANIE	C’mon. Get over there.
JAMIE	Go get your Jake Ryan.
EMILY	I can’t believe he did this.
KATE	Uh oh.
JAMIE	She’s coming back!
MELANIE	What happened?
EMILY	Tom said he didn’t want me to miss our dinner. I’m gonna meet him after.
EMILY	Porsche is ours for the night!
MELANIE	That was a slick move. Nice goin, Tom.
JAMIE	You’re sure? There will be other fun mom dinners.
KATE	Got that right, bitches.
EMILY	Yep. I’m sure.
