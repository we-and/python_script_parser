ELIAS		I hope this works.

ELIAS		Come on.

ELIAS		Jesus. Look at that thing.

ELIAS		Oh, man, we are cutting it close.

ELIAS		We're almost out of time.

ELIAS		Where you going?

ELIAS		Come on. Come on! Almost got it.

ELIAS		Hey! Move! We gotta get outta here!

ELIAS		Jesus.

ELIAS		Oh, boy, they are getting ripe!

ELIAS		Score!

ELIAS		Oh, yeah.

ELIAS		Oh, crap.

ROY		Who's there?

ROY		Elias?

ELIAS		What's happening, Roy? 

ELIAS		What are all these people still doing here?

ROY		Transport will be here soon. How is it on your floor?

ELIAS		You know, it's wobbly, but it's still standing.

ELIAS		Don't worry, people. You're not missing out on anything here.

ELIAS		This building is terrible. Landlord sucks, no rent control.

ELIAS		Make sure Carl wraps his knee up.

ROY		Yeah, I got it.

BESS		Where are you?

BESS 		Elias? Where are you?

ELIAS		I'm sorry.

BESS 		What for?

ELIAS		For leaving all the time.

ELIAS		The only way of doing what I do.

BESS 		I knew what I was getting into when we met.

ELIAS		It just worries me, you know? Anything should happen to you.

BESS 		I'll be all right. Okay? 

BESS 		You can't spend your day worrying about me.

BESS 		Worry about yourself.

ELIAS		I'll come back, Bess.

BESS 		I know you will.

COLONEL JAYDEN 	Elias, you out there? Elias, you out there? Over.

ELIAS		Go for Elias.
	
COLONEL JAYDEN 	How did it go, son?

ELIAS		I got most of everything that was on the list.

ELIAS		You can tell the doc I'll have his supplies down there ASAP.

COLONEL JAYDEN 	Roger that. Run into any trouble?

ELIAS		Just the usual. I managed to stun one of the drones... with a grenade, but no real damage.

COLONEL JAYDEN 	I want a full report when you come in. Out.

ELIAS		Yes, sir. You'll have it.

ELIAS		Well... if you're a bomb, my troubles are over.

ELIAS		Hornets come through again.

ELIAS		Open up in there!

ELIAS		Who's screaming?

ELIAS		Hey! 

ELIAS		Who's screaming?
 
MIKE		What do you want?

ELIAS		Open up!

MIKE		Who the hell are you?

ELIAS		I'm a friend of Frank's, the guy who guards this place.

MIKE		He quit. He skedaddled.

ELIAS		Where to?

MIKE		What, am I his mother? He vacated his post. I'm the new guy.

MIKE		Come on in. Look the dump over if you don't believe me.

ELIAS		Who was screaming? 

MIKE		It's probably the lady up on three.

MIKE		Her husband got killed last week. Ain't been the same since.

MIKE		I'm Mike.

ELIAS		Elias.

MIKE		So you're the famous Elias, huh?

MIKE		I heard of you.

ELIAS		Yeah? What did you hear?

MIKE		That you're a goody-goody. Always helping everybody.

ELIAS		Oh, that right?

MIKE		Hey, man, don't get me wrong. I think it's admirable.

MIKE		It's a nice break from all this dog-eat-dog stuff, you know?

MIKE		You think it's aliens?

ELIAS		Huh?

MIKE		This. All this. Alien invasion, right?

ELIAS		Yeah, everything seems to point that way.

MIKE		I just wish the little green bastards would show themselves.

MIKE		Then we'd have a real fight on our hands...instead of all this hit-and-run drone jazz.

MIKE		They're yellow, if you ask me.

MIKE		I'll check upstairs. You take down there.

ELIAS		Yeah.

ELIAS		Jesus!

MIKE		Truthfully, dog eat dog is a misnomer.

MIKE		Human flesh is so much sweeter.

MIKE		Yeah.

ELIAS		Freeze!

ELIAS		Don't worry. I'm not a savage. I'm a friendly.

ELIAS		What's going on?

CIVILIAN WOMAN 	There's some trouble on the street. Supply truck.

ELIAS 		Well, there's always trouble on the street.

ELIAS		Where you staying?

CIVILIAN WOMAN 	Small shelter in Koreatown.

ELIAS		Well, I suggest you get back there. It's dangerous around here.

ELIAS		I'll see if I can get some food down to you.

CIVILIAN WOMAN 	Thanks.

ELIAS 		Sure.

ELIAS		Got you suckers! How are things on the South Side, huh?

JOE		Hey, Elias. Someone spiked the road. Both fronts blew.

ELIAS		That sucks. Anything I can do to help you?

CHET 		Thanks. We're pretty much good.

RHYS		Hey, hey! 

RHYS		Looks like you're all alone back there, buddy.

ELIAS		Come on, Rhys! 

ELIAS		Let this one go, okay?

ELIAS		There's some people out there that really need this food.

RHYS		I really need it. We live in complicated times, Elias.

RHYS		Let me simplify it for you. Okay, if I'm hungry... I eat.

RHYS		Hey, maybe I'll eat you next.

ELIAS		Oh, you can try, but I taste pretty gamey.

RHYS		Drones!

ZANE 		Go, go, go, go, go!

RHYS		Go, go, go!

ZANE 		Come on! Come on!

RHYS		Nice toy. I like it.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	Attention! All personnel to loading dock Baker.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	The supplies have arrived. I repeat, the supplies have arrived.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	Attention! All personnel to loading dock Baker. The supplies have arrived.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	Report to unloading and disassembly immediately.

COLONEL		Didn't see a truck on your list of pick-ups this week.

ELIAS		Rhys and his savages hit the South Central transpo team. No survivors.

COLONEL		I'll contact their command. Second hit this week.

ELIAS		Sons of bitches are getting bolder.

ZANE 		No casualties. Unless you count hunger.

RHYS		Have them go on another run. Those markets south of the city--

ZANE 		They're all cleared out.

RHYS		Don't you think I know that?

RHYS		Okay, have them look again!

ZANE 		All right.

RHYS		Wait a minute, Zane. 

RHYS		There's something else.

RHYS		You know you're the only one I can trust, right?

ZANE 		I wouldn't worry, Rhys. They're all loyal.

RHYS		Yeah, up to a point. You know, until they feel they're smarter than the one who's leading them.

ZANE 		Got us this far.

RHYS		That's not enough

RHYS		Full stomachs can't be the end game.

ZANE 		Survival's enough for most these days.

RHYS		Yeah, for most. But since when are we like the rest?

RHYS		You know, survival's for suckers. When I was in the service...the only officers I respected were those willing to risk everything to win.

RHYS		Taking chances is the only real path to success.

RHYS		The Colonel...up there in his high tower.

RHYS		He shouldn't be the one leading this resistance.

ZANE 		It should have been you, Rhys.

RHYS		No! The system pretends they want innovators and original thinkers...but I wasn't meant to be in their army.

RHYS		You know, that's why I had to form one of my own.

ZANE 		So? What's your plan?

RHYS		What's my plan?


RHYS		Well, the Hornets, in the depths of their ignorance...have gifted Elias with a special weapon. You saw what that thing did.

ZANE 		First time I've ever seen a drone repelled./

RHYS		Right.

RHYS		That weapon will form our spearhead.

ELIAS		Hey, Doc.

DOC		Tell me you got what I need.

ELIAS		Well, I hope it's in there.

DOC		Thanks, Elias.

COLONEL		Food and medical, that's the key.

COLONEL		Can't fight the enemy unless we stay strong.

ELIAS		Well...I happen to have something in my backpack that might even the odds.

ELIAS		You won't believe what they left me.

ELIAS		I got home, and this was there waiting for me.

COLONEL		Effective?

ELIAS		It's more powerful than anything we have.

ELIAS		I mean, it won't take them out completely, but it'll stun them. Buy us some time.

ELIAS		It fires some kind of concentrated laser.

COLONEL		Gift from the Hornets?

ELIAS		That or Santa Claus.

COLONEL		I hope there's more weapons coming.

COLONEL		Latest report shows a massive invasion force closing in on the eastern seaboard.

COLONEL		We need all the firepower we can get.

COLONEL 		Getty! 

COLONEL 		Take a good look at what Elias brought us.

COLONEL 		I wanna know everything about it in two hours.

GETTY		Well, if it's crabs, I can't help you, buddy.

ELIAS		Well, scratch on this.

GETTY		This one wasn't made in China. Come on, let's check it out.

GETTY		It's been fired, too.

ELIAS		How can you tell that?

GETTY		Counter. Let's see.

GETTY		This sucker uses advanced remote sensing target technology.

GETTY		Uses high-energy lithium metal oxide batteries! Rocket grade!

GETTY		It didn't come with a charger, did it?

GETTY		Why you?

ELIAS		Beats me.

GETTY		Well, it ain't your looks.

ELIAS		That's for sure. 

GETTY		Let's see what it can really do.

GETTY		Here. Smart people, these bugs, whoever they are.

ELIAS		Yeah. I just wish they'd come out of hiding.

GETTY		Well, the Colonel says they have a plan.

GETTY		He doesn't say what, but he says they got one.

GETTY		We just can't see the big picture yet.

ELIAS		I'd sure like a hint.

GETTY		I would like detailed instructions...and a New York rare with a nice cabernet.

ELIAS		Talk about big picture.

GETTY		Yeah, man, it's bad.

GETTY		And they say that we've been lucky. East coast is getting hammered.

ELIAS		Yeah, this is luck.

ELIAS		Let's move.

SOLDIER TO COLONEL	What's going on, sir?

COLONEL		Punch in.

TECH		Three groups of two. Eagle formation.

ELIAS		Ah, brought the brothers with them.

GETTY 		Coming up the 110.

TECH		And fast.

ELIAS		Figures it takes the end of the world for the freeway to clear up.

GETTY 		Wait, wait. They're slowing. Closing in on Koreatown.

COLONEL		What are they after?

ELIAS		People. They're after people, sir.

COLONEL		Elias, wait!

KATE 		Come on, we can't stay here! Let's go! Go!

KATE 		Go, go, go! Come on!

KATE 		Do we have everybody?

ELIAS		Go on! Move! Move!

ELIAS		Come on, move! Go!

ELIAS		Move! Down around the corner and in the building!

ELIAS		Go on, move!

ELIAS		Around the corner! In the building!

ELIAS		Let's go! Move! Move! Hurry!

KATE		Sit, Garth. Sit.

ELIAS		We can't stay here. We gotta go. We gotta keep moving!

KATE		Stop shouting! These people are scared already!

KATE		He needs a tourniquet.
	
ELIAS		I got something here.


ELIAS		What, are you some kind of doctor?

KATE		You know how to get us out of here?

ELIAS		Yeah. There's an operations center not far.

ELIAS		There's food and medical.

KATE		Sounds like heaven.

ELIAS		It will be, so long as it lasts. What's your name?

KATE		Kate.

ELIAS		Okay, I'm Elias.

ELIAS		Listen to me. We gotta go.

KATE		Okay.

KATE 		Come on. Don't pull on it.

ELIAS		Come on! Let's move! Out the back.

KATE 		Come on.

ELIAS		Let's go!

KATE		How much farther?

ELIAS		We're close.

ELIAS		What the hell were you people doing up top anyway? It's a death sentence up there.

KATE		We came from San Diego. The place is a graveyard.

KATE		No food. No water. 

KATE		We were in a convoy. Got jumped just outside of town.

ELIAS		How many of you were there?

KATE		75.

ELIAS		Jeez.

KATE		We're all that's left.

ELIAS		Sorry to hear.

KATE		Never saw anybody put a dent on those things till today.

ELIAS		Yeah, well, things are looking up.

ELIAS		Hey, Getty. Getty!

ELIAS		If you can hear me, let the Doc know I'm coming in with some wounded.

GETTY		Stand by, Elias. Something big is going down.

TECH		Big Apple. Come in, Big Apple. This is Angel One.

TECH		We're answering your distress call. Come in, Big Apple.

TECH		- They aren't answering, sir.

COLONEL		Keep trying.

TECH		Big Apple. Come in, Big Apple. This is Angel One.

TECH		Can you hear me? Over.

MALE VOICE	Angel One, this is Big Apple.

MALE VOICE	Receiving heavy electrical interference.

MALE VOICE	Possible EMP assault. Large object on approach.

MALE VOICE	Appears to be drone assault warship.

MALE VOICE	Bigger than anything we've encountered.

MALE VOICE	Wait a minute. Base of object is starting to glow. Massive--

ELIAS		Just through here.

KATE 		Easy, easy, easy.

ELIAS		Get him on this bed right here.

ELIAS TO DOCTOR	Hey, Doc, we're gonna need you over here quick.

DOCTOR		Hold on.

KATE		Careful. Careful. Careful.

KATE 		Doctor, my friend has a class three hemorrhage. He's definitely gonna need blood. I'm an EMT.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Can you set a fracture?

KATE 		Yes, yes, absolutely.

COLONEL		Elias. A word.

ELIAS		Yes, sir.

COLONEL		New York's been obliterated.

COLONEL		The Hornets tried to help, but...

COLONEL		There's been enhanced drone activity in Chicago, just like New York.

COLONEL		They're taking the big cities out first.

COLONEL		That means we're next in line.

ELIAS		 What are we supposed to do about all these people here?

ELIAS		They can barely walk, much less run.

COLONEL		We can't outrun this. We're gonna have to fight.

ELIAS		Well, what about the Hornets? Have we heard from them? Are they planning an offensive?

COLONEL		Not since New York fell. 

DOCTOR TO ROOM	Hold on! It's a quake!

GETTY		Colonel, we need you topside ASAP.

COLONEL INTO WALKIE	Roger! On my way.

COLONEL		We gotta prepare for the worst. When the Hornets do call...we're gonna need you. That's an order.

ELIAS		Of course, sir.

ELIAS		I'm on it.

ELIAS		Hey. You gonna be all right?

KATE		Hi. Yeah, thank you.

ELIAS		You need anything?

KATE		No, no. We're good here.

ELIAS		I'm gonna take off for a while. I'll see you later.

KATE		Okay.

ELIAS		Hey, Getty, it's Elias.

ELIAS		I'm heading back to my place in Vector Six. How's it looking out there?

GETTY		Usual drone patrols, boss. No swarms. Stay safe.

DOCTOR TO KATE	How long since you slept?

KATE 		Can't remember.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Here, take my cot.

DOCTOR TO KATE		I don't use it much these days.

KATE 		I'm fine.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Please. You're no good to me if you collapse.

KATE 		It's not gonna happen.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Yes, it will!

DOCTOR TO KATE	Sorry, I've been a little grouchy since all this started.

DOCTOR TO KATE	I'm glad that you're here...

KATE 		- Kate.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Erwin.

DOCTOR TO KATE	But nobody ever called me that. Even my mother called me Doc.

KATE 		Okay, Doc. Happy to help.

DOCTOR TO KATE	You're hurt!

KATE 		It's fine. I can do it.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Stop being so tough.

KATE 		Okay.

KATE 		I'm surprised that you made it this far, given the flow of the wounded.

DOCTOR TO KATE	I had more help in the beginning.

DOCTOR TO KATE	I had my brother.

DOCTOR TO KATE	He died trying to get me medical supplies.

KATE 		I'm sorry.

DOCTOR TO KATE	It's around the time that Elias showed up.

DOCTOR TO KATE	One of our patrols found him half dead out by the stadium...brought him back here and...

DOCTOR TO KATE	I patched him up, and he's been our go-to guy ever since.

KATE 		Well, he certainly seems motivated.

KATE 		He saved our asses.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Yeah, he sort of specializes in that.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Don't ask me why. 

KATE 		Everybody needs something to keep them going.

KATE 		Some people like to look out for themselves.

KATE 		Others...

DOCTOR TO KATE	Try and save the world? Yeah, it's a little late for that.

KATE 		I don't know about that. Maybe if more were like Elias, we'd stand a chance.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Yeah, maybe you're right. I don't know.

DOCTOR TO KATE	The Colonel certainly seems to rely on him.

KATE 		Colonel's in charge here?

DOCTOR TO KATE	Yeah, he's the highest ranking officer...

DOCTOR TO KATE	in this sector.

DOCTOR TO KATE	He's a good man. He cares, but, you know, he's military...so he's a realist. 

DOCTOR TO KATE	I have orders, in case of evacuation, to leave all bed-ridden wounded behind.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Sacrifices will have to be made in order to ensure the survival of the rest, he says.

DOCTOR TO KATE	I'm not sure I agree with that.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	Attention. All scouts assemble in loading dock three for night patrols.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	All scouts to loading dock three.

KATE 		What is this place? 

KATE 		Seems like it's half shelter, half operations center.

DOCTOR TO KATE	That's about the size of it.

DOCTOR TO KATE	There were four emergency bases set up after the initial attacks.

KATE 		At least you have some semblance of order here.

KATE 		In San Diego there was nothing.

KATE 		No law. Nowhere to hide.

KATE 		The place went straight to the Stone Age after the food ran out.

KATE 		It's madness in the streets.

KATE 		People started eating their--

DOCTOR TO KATE	Yeah, I heard.

DOCTOR TO KATE	I'm not surprised, you know?

DOCTOR TO KATE	Order and security, they're just illusions.

DOCTOR TO KATE	They're things that we tell ourselves...to make ourselves feel better. You know?

DOCTOR TO KATE	Like this place. This place is a nice strong place.

DOCTOR TO KATE	This place will protect us. 

DOCTOR TO KATE	But I tell you, Kate...it's getting harder and harder to keep my head above the carnage.

KATE 		Hang in there, Doc. You're doing fine.

DOCTOR TO KATE	Thanks. You get some rest, all right?

DOCTOR TO KATE	I'll roust you in a couple of hours. You can relieve Linda.

ELIAS		Don't worry, it's just me again.

ELIAS		What the hell happened to you, bro?

ROY		Ceiling fell in on me, man.

ELIAS		You're kidding.

ELIAS		That doesn't look good.

ROY		Yeah. Don't feel good, either.

ELIAS		Tell you what, man, we go back to base camp, you're coming with me.

ELIAS		And I'm not taking no for an answer.

ROY		All right.

ELIAS		Damnit!

RHYS		Oh, wow...

RHYS		I wonder what this would do to human flesh.

RHYS		Melt it right off probably, huh?

RHYS		Like dipping your face in lava.

ELIAS			I'm not your enemy, Rhys.

RHYS		No, I know, we're good friends.

ELIAS		Let's not get carried away.

RHYS		No, let's.

RHYS		Nice place you got here.

RHYS		Oh, so sweet.

RHYS		I imagine your little lady kept it a lot cleaner.

ELIAS		Put that down. Put it down!	

RHYS		He's so sensitive.

RHYS		That's a little impractical in these times, don't you think?

ELIAS		Why don't you concentrate on who the real enemy is and stop screwing around with us!

RHYS		Who's the real enemy, Elias? Who's in control of these machines?

ELIAS			We don't know yet. Nobody does.

RHYS		So, the machines just run themselves?

RHYS		These so-called Hornets, they seem to know an awful lot.

RHYS		And if they know so much, then they must be behind it.

ELIAS		That's insane. You're insane, Rhys!

RHYS		I need a meeting with your friends.

RHYS		I have questions I wanna ask them.

ELIAS		Doesn't work like that.

RHYS		It'd be in your best interest to make it like that.

RHYS		If you wanna keep your pretty skin.

ZANE 		Come on!

ELIAS		Roy! Roy!

BESS TO ELIAS V.O.	Elias.

BESS 		Elias, where are you?

WOMAN CALLS OUT	Help me! Help me!

KELLY 		Excuse the theatrics, Sergeant.

KELLY 		Can't have people knowing of our comings and goings.

ELIAS		Thank God. You're a Hornet.

KELLY 		Highest marks.

ELIAS		Scientist or military?

KELLY 		Can I be both?

ELIAS		Sure.

ELIAS		I thought most of you were scientists.

KELLY 		Many of us are. But we come from all sectors, both private and public.

ELIAS		Yeah. 

KELLY 		How do you like your new weapon?

ELIAS		I love these. Wish we had a million of them.

KELLY 		We're working on that. We made a few adjustments while you were sleeping.

KELLY 		This is all part of the testing process, Sergeant.

KELLY 		And I'm proud to say that you've passed with flying colors.

ELIAS		Doesn't feel like it.

RHYS		How's everyone doing?

ZANE 		Vesna's dead.

ZANE 		The rest are pissed and half-blind.

ZANE 		So am I. 

RHYS		The Hornets.

ZANE 		What?

RHYS		It was the Hornets, okay?

RHYS		They used some kind of advanced flash grenade.

RHYS		Their eyes will clear.

ZANE 		Why would the Hornets use flash bombs? Why not shoot to kill?

RHYS		'Cause they weren't after us! They were after him, okay?

RHYS		We were just incidental annoyances, small potatoes.

ZANE 		I think I'm insulted.

RHYS		You should be.

ZANE 		Why do you think the Hornets have such a friggin' crush on that guy?

ZANE 		What makes him so special?

RHYS		Cause he's clean. Like the Colonel.

RHYS		You know, he fits the suit.

RHYS		But image never won a war.

RHYS		They overestimate Elias's importance and undervalue ours.

RHYS		 But I'm gonna change that.

ZANE 		How?

RHYS		We've been able to accomplish a lot with a relatively small bunch.

RHYS		Imagine if we were greater... in numbers.

ZANE 		What are you gonna do, hold tryouts?

RHYS		No.

ZANE 		And even if you did, the pickin's are pretty slim.

ZANE 		Vesna was the last good gun around.

RHYS		The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

ZANE 		You're not serious.

ZANE 		Bone?

RHYS		He's got the manpower.

ZANE 		Yeah, and he's got four notches on the stock of his rifle for every one of us that he's taken out!

RHYS		And we've evened the score, you know?

RHYS		You're making this too personal, Zane.

RHYS		Trading blows is just business. 

RHYS		And with business comes acceptable losses.

ZANE 		Tell that to Butchy and Mack and Sheila and Alex.

RHYS		Alex, right? That's his name?

ZANE 		Her.

RHYS		Her. Look, regardless, you know.

RHYS		An alliance would make us truly strong, you know?

RHYS		A force big enough to make some real change in this city.

RHYS		Changes that would turn this city from one in retreat...to one on an offensive.

RHYS		Make the call.

ZANE 		I'd rather not.

RHYS		Make it.

RHYS		Oh, and, Zane...

RHYS		Be nice.

KELLY 		Go.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	Will the AOD please report to CP. AOD report to CP.

ELIAS		Seems like you're pretty well fixed. How many of you are there?

KELLY 		Not enough. We lost a lot of good people in New York.

KELLY 		But we're rebuilding teams. All over.

ELIAS		Yeah? To do what exactly?

KELLY 		Well...let's just say the days of waiting...the days of hoping they'll just leave...well, those days are over.

ELIAS		Booyah.

GANG MEMBER TO ZANE	 Nice hair.

ZANE 		What?

GANG MEMBER TO ZANE	Nothing.

ZANE 		That's what I thought.

RHYS		There's a lot of bad blood in this room.

RHYS		Things done that can't be undone.

RHYS		But I say to you now, Bone...desperate times, it calls for desperate measures.

RHYS		Right?

BONE TO RHYS	Who's desperate?

RHYS		Who's desperate.

RHYS		Anyone here says he isn't is a goddamn liar!

BONE TO RHYS	Why am I even listening to you, Rhys?

RHYS		Because I speak the truth.

RHYS		And that truth will move mountains!

RHYS		If we join forces!

RHYS		No?

RHYS		It's okay.

RHYS		The Hornets have given the keys to the kingdom to the meek.

RHYS		This is a mistake.

RHYS		That prophecy has proven a lie. They shall not inherit the earth!

RHYS		We'll infiltrate their fortress...and take control. It's all in there.

RHYS		Information. Weapons. Which is the source to our new beginning.

RHYS		Bone, listen. By combining forces, the power of the Hornets will be ours.

BONE TO RHYS	What's my cut?

RHYS		It's 50/50 right down the middle.

RHYS		If you want less, I'm happy to give it.

BONE TO RHYS	My brother.

ZANE 		Just intercepted a new transmission.

ZANE 		New food and medical shipment coming in from Vegas.

ZANE 		Be here in four hours, over the Sixth Street bridge.

RHYS		Nice, nice, nice! We have our way in! Let's move! Let's go!

KELLY 		Success of failure largely depends on timing, Sergeant.

KELLY 		You're here for Phase IV.

ELIAS		What's Phase IV? Not that I know what phases one, two and three are.

SCIENTIST TO KELLY	Target is 10 clicks and closing, ma'am.

KELLY 		They've taken the bait.

ELIAS		The bait? What?

KELLY 		Three weeks ago, our code breakers determined the way into the machines.

KELLY 		You see, the drone scouts communicate...via an intricate electrical language, much like insect chatter.

KELLY 		Once we cracked it, we realized we could send messages to them.

KELLY 		They think they're coming to assist a downed comrade...but instead they get a big surprise.

KELLY 		Let me guess, it goes boom.

KELLY 		In a very big way.

KELLY 		Load her up. Let's get her out there double time.

KELLY 		Give me camera number nine.

TECH 		Yes, ma'am.

ELIAS		I've never seen a drone get downed before. How did you bag that?

KELLY 		We shot it down using an advanced version of the same gun we gave you.

KELLY 		Knowledge makes us strong.

KELLY 		That and time are what's most valuable.

TECH 		Five clicks and closing.

ELIAS		I don't get it.

ELIAS		I mean, why is one drone coming to the rescue of another drone if they're robots.

ELIAS		What do they care?

KELLY 		More like soldiers.

KELLY 		They take orders. Not that different from you and me.

KELLY 		They're on a rescue mission.

TECH 		Two clicks and closing, ma'am.

ELIAS		Hey. Now wait. Now that...

ELIAS		That's no scout drone.

KELLY 		Belief in the impossible has made you who you are, Elias. Don't abandon that quality.

ELIAS		Yeah, but these mother ships, they can destroy an entire city.

ELIAS		You know what they're gonna do to this place?

TECH 		Target in sight. 

KELLY 		What's the status?

TECH 		Device is in position.

KELLY 		Activate.

TECH 		Yes, ma'am.

TECH 		Activated.

ELIAS		How do you know that this is gonna work?

KELLY 		We don't. 

KELLY 		It worked on the scouts. Took down a dozen in one pop.

KELLY 		It has an escalating relay effect, a series of repeat explosions.

KELLY 		Each triggering the next. It'll spread inside the ship like a computer virus...until the beast is dead.

ELIAS		But you're not sure.

KELLY 		That's why we call it a test.

KELLY 		Come with me.

KELLY 		We're setting up teams at several major cities...working on similar devices.

KELLY 		The baiting signal's working like a charm...so none of the others need a downed drone to complete your mission.

KELLY 		Today's use is just for luck.

ELIAS		Wait, wait, wait. My mission?

KELLY 		Los Angeles is a key target.

KELLY 		You'll be receiving a code to activate your device.

KELLY 		Shut them down.

KELLY INTO WALKIE	Where's Davis and Martin?

TECH INTO WALKIE	Heading back now, ma'am.

KELLY 		Learn from this, Elias. Whatever happens, this is the way to progress.

KELLY 		The only way to defeat them.

ELIAS		You know what's behind these things? Who's behind them?

KELLY 		No. We've detected no biological life form.

KELLY 		As far as we know, they're all mechanical.

KELLY 		Mechanical drilling machines...harvesting liquid metals out of the earth's core.

TECH INTO WALKIE	Target has stopped, ma'am.

KELLY INTO WALKIE	Prepare to fire.

TECH OVER WALKIE	Standing by.

KELLY 		Put these on. 

ELIAS		I hope this works.

TECH OVER WALKIE	Davis and Martin are down!

KELLY REACTING	Bastards!

KELLY INTO WALKIE	Light 'em up!

TECH INTO WALKIE	Firing!

KELLY INTO WALKIE	Status on the target!

TECH OVER WALKIE	Hard to say, ma'am. Heavy electrical disturbance.

ELIAS		From here it looks like it's retreating and pretty beat up.

KELLY 		But not down. Not yet.

KELLY 		We need to modify the virus.

COLONEL		What's the ETA on the supply truck?

TECH		Within the hour, sir.

TECH		There have also been reports of increased activity from Rhys and company in Sector Seven.

COLONEL		Send triple the men. We need this shipment.

TECH		Sir.

COLONEL 		Any word from Elias?

GETTY 		No, sir.

GETTY 		Our last contact was over eight hours ago...and he hasn't checked in since. It's not like him.

KATE 		Doctor, there's a woman back there in terrible pain. Can I give her morphine?

DOCTOR 		It's gone.

KATE 		It's a deep cut. She needs an antibiotic.

DOCTOR 		We're out!

DOCTOR 		There's a bottle of brandy in the back. You can use that.

DOCTOR 		Have you seen Elias?

KATE 		There's a rumor there's a shipment coming in at any time.

KATE 		Maybe he's with them.

DOCTOR 		I pray he is.

KATE 		Hold on!

KELLY 		One thing's for sure, we're on the right track.

KELLY 		Let's get back to Command Tent.

SPOTTER 		Incoming!

ELIAS		We gotta get to cover. Now!

ELIAS		Get the chopper ready! I'm gonna hold them off!

ELIAS		Come on, move it! 

ELIAS		Back behind the blast wall!

ELIAS		Keep it moving! Go!

ELIAS		Come on!

ELIAS		Let's go! Move, move, move!

KELLY 		We gotta move! Come on!

ELIAS		What about the rest of your team?
	
KELLY 		They've all got their jobs!

KELLY 		This is ours!

KELLY 		Still got its stinger. That mother--

KELLY 		A lot of work left to do.

ELIAS		Yeah, we're running out of time.

KELLY 		Quicker than you know. The rate that they're harvesting...this planet will no longer be able to sustain human life.

ELIAS		Well, how much time do we have left?

KELLY 		Weeks, if we're lucky.

KELLY 		We've also picked up something underground.

KELLY 		Could be nothing, but we think it's another form of drone.

ELIAS		Yeah, speaking of drones, why aren't they going after the chopper?

KELLY 		We're cloaked. At least until they crack it.

KELLY 		Same as your ride.

ELIAS		I have a ride?

KELLY 		You'll see. Remember...your job is to save L.A. at all costs.

KELLY 		The activation code for the L.A. device.

ELIAS		Where's the bomb?

KELLY 		After today, it'll need some modifications.

KELLY 		We'll be in touch when it's ready.

KELLY 		Colonel Jayden will also get the bomb's coordinates.

KELLY 		Should anything happen to you, he will proceed with the operation.

KELLY 		We'll drop you on the outskirts of town.

KELLY 		An old military radio tower left over from World War II.

KELLY 		There's an armored transport waiting.

KELLY 		The drones won't be able to detect you 

ELIAS		Roger that. 

KELLY 		One more thing, Elias. 

KELLY 		Be careful.

ELIAS		Damn.

ELIAS		I hope I can drive this thing.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	Attention. All personnel to loading dock Baker.

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.	The truck has arrived. Report for unloading and disassembly.

GUARD 		Hey, guys. Where the hell you guys been? We've been waiting for you.

RHYS		Come on, boys! Let's go!

RHYS		Let's go to work!

TECH 		Shots fired! We got bogies inside the perimeter!

COLONEL		Set up barricades! Alpha and Delta, go, go, go!

TECH		I'm not a soldier.

COLONEL		You are now.


NURSE TO ROOM	They're shooting! They're shooting! They're shooting!

KATE 		What's happening? Who is it?

NURSE TO KATE	They're shooting.


KATE 		Doc, don't slip away on me. We gotta take care of the patients.

KATE 		Doc! What about weapons? Are there any weapons?

RHYS		I hate sick people!

DOCTOR 		Stop! Stop!

GANG MEMBER 		Like we're gonna stop!

RHYS		We just got started. Go, find a way up to the top.

RHYS		Slick, move some of these bleeders, okay? I don't wanna catch something.

ZANE 		Hello, handsome.

RHYS		Zane, get me a direct line to the Colonel. I wanna play with the big boys' toys. Let's go.

ZANE 		Bye-bye.

RHYS		No, no, no, no, no.

RHYS		We can't afford to kill anyone who's actually willing to fight.

KATE 		I'll never follow you, you scum!

RHYS		Hey, no. You don't know what you're missing.

COLONEL 		Keep your eyes peeled.

SOLDIERS 		Yes, sir.

COLONEL 		Any word from below?

TECH		Nothing, sir.


COLONEL 		Try to raise Sergeant Bennett at South Side.

TECH		Been trying. They don't answer.

GETTY 		Sir, they've made contact!

COLONEL 		Who?

GETTY 		The Hornets! It's official.

GETTY 		We've got orders!

COLONEL 		It's begun then.

TECH		What has?

COLONEL 		Payback.

RHYS		What you got?

ZANE 		Nothing yet.

ZANE 		Why don't you go spend some more quality time with blondie?

RHYS		Jealous.

ZANE 		I hate those types.

ZANE 		Little Miss Spunky! 

ZANE 		 I'll give you spunky with both barrels.

RHYS		Calm down. She's yours in time.

RHYS		Let's keep our eyes on the prize, huh? We gotta get into that command center.

RHYS		Don't want our boys roaming around like lost puppies.

ZANE 		Here. Got it.

ZANE 		Base operations is probably one of these areas... located in the upper levels, one floor below the roof.

ZANE 		Access points seem to be defended with machine gun emplacements.

ZANE 		We try a direct frontal assault, we'll get cut to pieces.

RHYS		Hey, that's what Bone's boys are for. Let them be the cannon fodder.

RHYS		What's the most direct route?

ZANE 		Hard to say from this schematic. 

ZANE 		There's multiple elevator banks and stairwells. Any of them could be a dead end or booby-trapped.

RHYS		Well, let's cut down on some of those options, shall we?

ZANE 		I love your hair!

RHYS		Hey, Doc, what's the most direct way to the Command Center?

DOCTOR 		I don't know. I'm just a doctor.

RHYS		You're telling me you've never been up there?

DOCTOR 		No.

RHYS		Not even to take the Colonel's temperature?

DOCTOR 		No.

RHYS		Well...that's interesting.

KATE 		Son of a bitch!

RHYS		No, no. Just someone with a clear sense of purpose.

RHYS		What's the most direct way to the Command Center?

KATE 		Don't tell him, Doc.

DOCTOR 		No, no, no, no!

DOCTOR 		I'll show you.

RHYS		I thought so.

RHYS		Have the good doctor lead the way, and radio the others.

RHYS		You can't fight a war with one hand tied around your balls.

RHYS		The Colonel isn't a leader. He wasn't even a good soldier.

RHYS		That's why it's my destiny to take the reins.

ZANE 		I got your line to Command. It's a little bloody.

RHYS		Gross.

SOLDIER 		We got movement.

SOLDIER		Freight elevator Delta.

COLONEL 		Hold them as long as you can.


GETTY 		Sir, I've lost contact with Bergman and Green, and there's at least a dozen infiltrators.

COLONEL 		No matter what happens, they can't get the coordinates .

COLONEL 		Secure the laptop. We evacuate if necessary.

GETTY 		Yes, sir.

SOLDIER 		Identify yourself!

SOLDIER 		Identify yourself!

SOLDIER 		Doc, that you?

DOCTOR 		It's a trap!

SOLDIER 		Get 'em!

GANG MEMBER 	Come on! Here we go! Get 'em!

SOLDIER 		There's too many!

SOLDIER 		Two o'clock! Two o'clock!

SOLDIER 		We're being overrun!

GETTY 		Coordinates being updated, sir. Hornets are moving the location of the bomb.

GETTY 		New coordinates to be determined.

TECH		Stand by, Bravo Team.


TECH		Sir, it's Bennett with food and meds.

COLONEL 		Put him on speaker.


COLONEL 		Sergeant Bennett, return to base immediately! We are under attack!

COLONEL 		I repeat, we are under--

RHYS		Yoo-hoo, Colonel.

COLONEL 		Rhys.

RHYS		You're surrounded. I have the food, weapons, supplies.

RHYS		I have hostages, all clinging to life.

RHYS		Though they won't be for long, unless you turn over all devices...and data you've received from the Hornets to me.

COLONEL 		What devices? Prepare to fire.

RHYS 		 Don't do that, okay?

RHYS		Don't insult my intelligence.

RHYS		You'll turn it all over to me.

RHYS		Question is, how many bodies will pile up in the process?

COLONEL 		We've got to play for time. Getty, pack the laptop. 

COLONEL 		Tell them we'll cooperate.

COLONEL 		Let's head for the Alamo.

COLONEL 		Courage, son.
	
RHYS		Maybe I wasn't making myself clear.

RHYS		You have 15 minutes to come down from your perch and deliver the goods.

RHYS		If you don't, I will begin to kill the wounded.

RHYS		One for every five minutes you're overdue.

SOLDIER 		There's too many of them!

FEMALE SOLDIER	We can't hold them!

TECH		Take the drives to the roof. Do it now.

ELIAS		Mark, this is Elias. I'm coming in.

TECH 		Elias, stay where you are. Do not come in. Repeat, do not come in.

TECH 		We are being overrun.

ELIAS		What's going on?

ELIAS		Where's the Colonel?

TECH 		He's evacuated to safe house Delta.

ELIAS		The Alamo?

TECH 		Affirmative. 

TECH 		That's the rallying point. Get to him, Elias.

TECH 		We're lost.

ELIAS		Mark, do you copy?

GETTY 		Dock Two! All gassed up and waiting!

GETTY 		Get to the safe house! I got your back!

KATE 		No! 

RHYS		Well, think of it this way, buddy. There'll be a lot less pain.

ZANE 		They're through!

RHYS 		Yes!

RHYS		Bone, talk to me!

BONE 			We're in, Rhys.

RHYS 		Excellent. Find the Colonel and bring him to me.

MACE 		Where you going, worm? Where you going to?

BONE 		Where's the Hornet data?

BONE 			Where's the Colonel?

TECH 		I don't know!

TECH 		The safe house! Little Tokyo!

BONE 		Get us a map. 

BONE 		Little worm here's gonna show us exactly where.

COLONEL 		En route to the Alamo. Will advise once in position.

COLONEL 		This is Baker 4-51 on a secure line.

COLONEL 		Awaiting transmission of final coordinates. Over.

RHYS		Stay here with the radio, okay? Tell Slick to grab some psychos and meet us at the truck.

ZANE 		What's happening?

RHYS		It's the Colonel, okay? We're going after him.


RHYS		You're coming with us! Let's go!

KATE 		Let go of me!

ELIAS		Here we go again.

ELIAS		Come on, get up! 

ELIAS			Get up! You wanna live? Come on! Hurry!

ELIAS		Go!

ELIAS		Come on, go!

ELIAS			It's okay. The drones can't see the truck, all right? You're safe.

ELIAS			Jesus. All right, where we're going there's a doctor.

ELIAS			They're gonna take care of you, I promise.

WOUNDED WOMAN 	Thank you

ELIAS		Everything's gonna be okay. 

ELIAS		All right?

FEMALE VOICE 		Bomb coordinates transmitting now. Over.

COLONEL	 	Roger that. It's coming through.

COLONEL 		It's coming through.

COLONEL 		Go to hell! 

ELIAS		Colonel!

ELIAS		Stay with me, sir.

COLONEL		I don't think it's in the cards, son.

ELIAS		What the hell was that thing?

COLONEL		You tell me. 

COLONEL		This whole thing gets better by the minute.

ELIAS		What happened back at base?

COLONEL		Rhys, he took...he took the building by force

COLONEL		He's holding everyone hostage.

ELIAS		Son of a bitch!


ELIAS		Don't worry, I'm gonna get you to the transport.

COLONEL		No! No, listen to me.

COLONEL		Listen to me. I've got the new coordinates.

COLONEL		Everything you need for the bomb.

COLONEL		Two hours till...till detonation.

ELIAS		Yeah, I know what I have to do.

COLONEL		Yeah, you always have. But don't...don't forget the people. 

COLONEL		Save as many as you can. But get them away from that Rhys!

COLONEL		That scum! 

COLONEL		They won't survive.
	
COLONEL		Save them, son.

COLONEL			Otherwise... none of this matters.

ELIAS		I will. I will, sir.

ELIAS		I promise. Just--

ELIAS		Colonel?

ELIAS		Colonel!

RHYS		Where's the fire, Elias?

ELIAS		The entire planet's burning, if you didn't notice.

RHYS		I did. I did notice, yeah.

RHYS		So, what are you and the Colonel gonna do about it? 

RHYS		Wait for us all to get fried?

ELIAS		You got your wish there. The Colonel's dead.

RHYS		Oh, I'm sorry. Died of fright, I suppose.

ELIAS		Or died fighting drones, with honor.

ELIAS		Not like... you savages.

RHYS		Honor.

ELIAS		Yeah, honor.


RHYS		Honor. Let's test that.

RHYS		Slick. 

ELIAS 		Hey, take it easy!

RHYS		Take it easy!"


RHYS		Why you gotta say that? You and the Colonel, you're like peas in a pod.

RHYS		Always showing your ass, man.

ELIAS		This is between me and you. You can let her go.

RHYS		Sure. Sure, I'll let her go. Just hand over what the Hornets gave you...and you can have your date.

RHYS		If not...I feed her to the wolves.

RHYS		And believe me... there won't be much left.

ELIAS		Kate!

KATE		Elias! 

ELIAS		Come on!

ELIAS		You are something. This way!

RHYS		Come on, come on, come on!

ZANE		Come in, Rhys. Do you copy?

ZANE		Rhys, are you out there?

ZANE 		Damnit!

TJ		What's the status?

ZANE		Static. Last voice transmission, they were entering the safe house...to intercept the Colonel. Minutes later, there was a lot of shooting...and screaming, and then nothing.

TJ		When was that?

ZANE		15 minutes ago.


TJ		That's bad.

ZANE		Could be just an impact on the radio.

TJ		Yeah, and it could be that they're all smoked.

ZANE		We should go look for them.

TJ		No.

TJ		Bone says we hold. So we hold.

ZANE		Since when are you taking orders from Bone?

TJ		I'm not taking orders from anybody. I'm just smart enough to know where the wind blows.

TJ		And right now, it's blowing towards Bone.

ZANE		You mean you're blowing Bone.
	
TJ		No. That's your department.

TJ		It kinda clouds your judgement, don't you think?

ZANE		Maybe I'll put this in your mouth. That'll certainly cloud yours.

TJ		Kinky. Maybe later.

TJ		Look, with Rhys out of the picture...command falls to Bone.

TJ		So, if I was you...I would start analyzing that data that they got from the Command Center...so we can see what these Hornets are up to.

ZANE		What do you think I'm doing, Judas?

TJ		Look, I think Bone knows that you are loyal to Rhys.

TJ		So, if I was you, I'd start making a good impression.

TJ		Otherwise, you end up like those little people. Or worse.

ZANE		The Colonel probably took any information of value with him.

TJ		Nah. 

TJ		It was probably just a distraction to keep us away from the score.

ZANE		I don't think so. 

ZANE		Those screams I heard weren't your every day running from drones stuff.

ZANE		They were freakin' scared. They ran into something new.

ZANE		Whatever that something is, could be more valuable than anything we have here.

TJ		I think you're over-analyzing it, Zane.

TJ		I'll let Bone know that you're on board.

TJ			Look, he'll take us far, Zane. You'll see.

TJ		I mean, he's even cooking up some entertainment for us.

TJ		Some Roman type colosseum stuff for the little people.

TJ			You see... that's the way to lead.

ZANE		Mm-hmm. You know what, TJ?

ZANE			I'm gonna keep trying Rhys. And if he's not dead...he's definitely gonna wanna know just how quickly you slagged him off.

ZANE		Don't you think?

TJ		Either way...I'm ready.

ZANE		Come in, Rhys. Do you copy?

ZANE		Rhys, come in!

KATE		Nice ride.

ELIAS		You got a patient back there you may wanna check.

KATE		Slow pulse. She needs blood.

KATE		What is that?

ELIAS		It's the location coordinates.


ELIAS		We got two hours.

ELIAS		The Hornets built this bomb to take out the mother ships.

ELIAS		So, when she does arrive, she's gonna get the biggest surprise of her life.

ELIAS		Assuming it works.

KATE		Sounds like we don't have much time then.

ELIAS		We don't. Let's roll.

ELIAS		Hang on.

BONE		All sickies against the wall.

BONE		Move!

BONE		Food is for soldiers. You wanna eat? 

BONE		You're gonna have to fight each other.

MACE 		To the death!

MACE 		If you win, you survive.

MACE 		 You don't

TJ 		You die like a dog!

ZANE 		Been trying to raise Rhys. Can't reach anybody.
	
KATE 		Do you copy? Over. This is a code red! Do you read me? Over.

KATE 		This is Kate from Medical Facility. Does anyone copy?
	
BONE 		This is Bone. Where's Rhys?

ELIAS		Rhys and Slick have been badly wounded in a drone attack.

ELIAS		Vehicle destroyed. Everyone else killed.

ELIAS		We're coming in hot! Drone's on our ass! Open the gate!

PATIENT 		This is our chance! Let's go!

WOMAN 		Watch out!

PATIENT 		Hurry up!

GANG MEMBER 		Let's get outta here!

ELIAS 		Come on, move it!

ELIAS 			Get that food over there! Get it outta here!

GETTY 			Everyone get out!

GETTY 			Hey! Help-- Got to--

GANG MEMBER 		Oh, my leg!

ELIAS		Kate!

ELIAS		Come on!

ELIAS		Go! Go! Move it! Come on!

MAN 		Go, go! Get in there!

KATE 		Go, go, go, go!	

ELIAS		I never liked that place anyway.

ELIAS		It's filthy.

KATE		You prefer your apartment?

ELIAS		Oh, hell no. That place is a bigger dump.

ELIAS		I mean, it wasn't always like that, you know?

KATE		You mean you had someone?

ELIAS		Yeah, I had someone. 

ELIAS		Yeah.

ELIAS		She was something else, too. Tell you that.

ELIAS		She made the place beautiful, you know?

ELIAS		Made it like a real home.

ELIAS		If it was left to me, it'd be more like a frat house.

ELIAS		I lost her at the stadium during the first assault.

ELIAS		Just... the place was shot to hell, filled with smoke...and I couldn't see her anywhere.

ELIAS		I could hear her, though, you know? 

ELIAS		I could hear her calling out to me.

ELIAS		And that whole entire side of the stadium just collapsed.
	
ELIAS		Never saw her again.

KATE		I'm sorry. 

KATE		I... know how it feels to lose someone.

ELIAS		Yeah, well, if we lose this fight...we lose forever.

KATE		We're not gonna lose.

ELIAS		All right, come on, let's go! Get inside! Get inside! Let's go!

GETTY		Whoa! Look at that!

KATE		I've never seen one this close before. You?
	
ELIAS		Yeah, closer than I'd like to admit.

KATE 		I want you to find a room where you can put the wounded.

KATE 		And also a room for food. I wanna see how much we have in the coming days.

GETTY		Looks like the place has been set up for us.

GETTY		You know, why not do it themselves? Why go through all this trouble?

ELIAS		Well, we're not the only ones fighting this war.

ELIAS		If we lose, someone else will pick up where we left off until there's nobody left to fight.

KATE 		Is that a drone tracking system?

GETTY		Yeah, looks like it. More sophisticated than anything I've ever seen.

ELIAS 		There it is. Right there.

ELIAS		I need you to navigate me to this exact location.

GETTY		Navigate you to do what?

KATE		What is that?

ELIAS		That... that's the payload.

GETTY		So, what happens now?

ELIAS		Well, now I take this computer back... and I leave you.

GETTY		Wait, you're going back into the city? That's crazy!

ELIAS		Somebody's gotta stop them. Otherwise, we lose the entire city and everybody in it!

KATE		With all this technology, we can't remote detonate?

ELIAS		Apparently not.

ELIAS		Hey, Getty, it's up to you to get me there. I'm counting on you.

GETTY		No pressure.

ELIAS		Great work today.

KATE		At least let me come with you.

ELIAS		No way. Not a chance.


KATE		I'm trained to help. You need me on this

ELIAS		Not a chance in hell!

ELIAS		No. I'm tired of losing people that I care about.

ELIAS		I'm not losing you, too. I'm doing this alone. That's final.

KATE		Get it done.

ELIAS		I will.

ELIAS		Thanks.

KATE 		I'll be right back.

ELIAS		This is crazy.

ELIAS		This is Elias. Copy? You guys with me?

GETTY		You are listening to KRON, apocalypse radio...with your Monday afternoon drone forecast.

GETTY		Watch the skies, friends. Take an umbrella.

ELIAS		You're real funny, Getty.

GETTY		That's not good. That's not good. That's not good. Shit!

GETTY		I'm getting a lot of electrical interference here!

ELIAS		Well, you're the IT guy. Work it out.

GETTY		Sure, I'll just consult my end of the world manual.

ELIAS		You got me on screen?

GETTY		Gotcha!


GETTY		All right. Head for the 10. It'll be clear for once.

GETTY		And then, once in town, Temple to Hill.

GETTY		But be careful, there are drones all over the place.

ELIAS		Copy!

GETTY		How can there be lightning on a clear day? Doesn't make any sense.

ELIAS		Getty, it's Elias. You copy?

ELIAS		Getty, come in!

GETTY		Elias, come back with that.


ELIAS		We got some action out here.

GETTY		Heavy interference. I can't read you.


ELIAS		I'm in trouble!

GETTY		Elias, you gotta get outta there!

GETTY		Get off the road!

ELIAS		Getty?

ELIAS		You piece of crap.

ELIAS		At least these suckers can't see me.

GETTY		No! No! No! We lost the tower!

COMPUTER VOICE	Cloaking malfunction. Cloaking malfunction.

ELIAS		Oh, no, no, no. Not now. Not now, please!

KATE		Don't mind me!

ELIAS		Whoa!

ELIAS		What the hell are you doing? You're gonna get yourself killed!

KATE		So are you.

ELIAS		Watch out for the--

ELIAS		Recoil.

ELIAS		Come on! Come on!

ELIAS		Hold them off while I get this truck started!

ELIAS		Come on, baby. Come on, come on.

ELIAS		Won't start!

KATE		Come on! Forget it, we gotta go!

ELIAS		Move!

ELIAS		Come on!

ELIAS		The radio was in there.

KATE		Do you know how to get there still?

ELIAS		Sure.

ELIAS		But how?

ELIAS		Come on! 

ELIAS		Jesus. Look at that thing.

ELIAS		Man, we are cutting it close.

ELIAS 		Come on.

ELIAS		Where you going?

ELIAS		All right, I'm in!

KATE		Who are they?

ELIAS		Got it! It's set!

ELIAS		She was the leader of the Hornets.

ELIAS		There's nothing we can do for them. We gotta go.

RHYS		Elias!

RHYS		Bugs made us some nice toys, huh?

ELIAS		You're still alive? Come on, Rhys.

ELIAS		The game is over. Let's just all get outta here.

RHYS		We're all gonna die anyway. Look, dude.

RHYS		Maybe this is our time. 

RHYS		You know, maybe this is the moment when we all go.

ELIAS		That can be your choice. We're leaving.

RHYS		No, you're not. Not today.

RHYS		Today, we all go to hell.

ELIAS		Come on!

KATE		We gotta go.

GETTY		Look! Look! They did it! They did it! They did it!

GETTY		Yes! Yes!

GETTY		Oh, my God.

KATE		It's over.

ELIAS		No.

ELIAS		It's just the beginning.
