(Glammys School Of Fashion vlog EPS 102)

AMBRA	My name is Ambra. I am a student at the High School of Fashion.. (inhales) And I could be the first of my class if...

VAN LINDEN	Is this supposed to be a casual dress?.. A three year old child could do better.

AMBRA	(off) (whining) If only I weren't so lazy.

AINA	Hi Ambra!

KEI	Hi Ambra!

AMBRA	(inhales) I share a dorm room with Aina and Kei.. (inhales) We're alike in everything.. For example.. I’m tidy...just like Aina... (gasping) Oh!.. I always study...just like Kei.. (gasps)

KEI	Look at the time,, it's 5 o'clock.. and you still haven't done anything!

AMBRA	(drawn out gasps)

AMBRA	To have good ideas.. you need concentration.(inhales) You use up tons of pencils...(inhales) and a lot of energy!

AMBRA	(inhales) Ah!.. (exhales) Ah, I really need a break! Bye Kei, I'm going out!

KEI	Ambra's absolute record. Fifteen minutes over a drawing assignment.

AMBRA	(whispering) Aina!.. Sorry I’m so late.. Want some?

AINA	(sigh)

AMBRA	(sigh)

AMBRA	In the meantime, it started to pour outside.. Neither of us had an umbrella.. and we got drenched by all the rain.. Wow.. A beautiful evening.

AMBRA	I was soaking wet...I sat to take off my shoes...on the chair where I had left the drawing I had to finish! Van Linden will never let me hear the end of it! And while I was crying, the colors started blending together.. so I got an idea...

AMBRA	It's just perfect now… right?(chuckling) Couldn't be more casual than that! [
