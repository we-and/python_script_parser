(PARADISE HILLS 4)




UMA	Ready?

NURSE 1	These girls are supposed to be completed. She's done. She's done. Wait, this one's still got one session left.

NURSE 2	Okay, let's get to it.

CHLOE	What do we do?

UMA	We can't leave her behind. Come on.

CHLOE	Okay, wait. That way.

UMA	Okay.

NURSE 1	Head right, huh?

CHLOE	Let's go.

NURSE 1	First off, your boat's a piece of shit.

NURSE 2	God damn it. It's not fair.

NURSE 1	Secondly, you got zero patience.

NURSE 2	Wait. We gotta update the log.

NURSE 1	Jeez. Can we wait till after dinner? I’m starving, man.

NURSE 2	Let's just get it over with, huh?

NURSE 1	Fine.

NURSE 2	You say I've got no patience...but you're the one that's always gotta eat so bad.

SENIOR SURGEON	Vocal cords, as well as a scan of the pupil and iris. Yo, is she roommates with that fat Southern girl? I think so. Why?

JUNIOR SURGEON	Don't know, I kinda like that one. I feel sorry for her, though.

SENIOR SURGEON	What about the ones you don't like? You don't feel sorry for them?

JUNIOR SURGEON	Yeah, well, if I felt sorry for all of them... this job would be un-fricking-bearable.


UMA	Chloe!

CHLOE	Let her go, douche-canoes!

JUNIOR SURGEON	Christ, man, call her!

DUCHESS	What is it?

SENIOR SURGEON	Two girls are awake.

YU	Chloe!

SENIOR SURGEON	They're here in the OR!


DUCHESS	Who?

SENIOR SURGEON	Mademoiselle Yu's roommates. She's also awake!

DUCHESS 	Do I need to hold your hand? They're completed. Finish them off.

UMA	No! Chloe!

SENIOR SURGEON	We may need some help here.

YU	Uma! Uma!

UMA	Yu! Yu! Yu, breathe!

SENIOR SURGEON	I'm only doing my job.

JUNIOR SURGEON	Easy, sweetheart.

UMA	Yu! Yu. Yu.

CHLOE	Yu. Yu. Yu.

UMA	It's okay. It's okay.

CHLOE	Come here. I got you.

UMA	Here. Here.


CHLOE 	You're okay. Come on. It's okay. It's okay.

UMA	What is that?

CHLOE	Come on.

UMA	Put her over here.

CHLOE	What?


JUMP ROPE GIRLS	(SINGING) Higher, higher, higher, higher

YU	I don't know how to be. I embarrass them.

FEMALE LOOK RESIDENT	Every time I look at myself. Whoops.

DUCHESS	Observe your life from a new perspective.

UMA	And whose perspective is that? Yours?

YU	I don't know how to be. I embarrass them. I embarrass them.

TECHNICIAN 2	Hang tight.

UMA	He's a Lower, so he basically doesn't exist to her.

SON	Lowers like to say all kinds of things about me.

UMA	They're not treating us. Can someone let me down? They've been observing us. Measuring every single thing about who we are. He's a sociopath.

CHLOE	But why? I mean, what's all this for? Yu? Yu, Yu. We need to find a way outta here. Okay.

UMA	What are you doing to us? Let me out of here! Let me down! Turn it off! I'm in love with somebody else.

CHLOE	This way.

UMA	That lying piece of shit.

CHLOE	Uma! We've gotta go. We gotta go now.

MALE	Get them!

CHLOE	Uma, now!

MALE	Get them! Hey!

UMA	No!

MALE	Stop! Open up, you punks! Open the door! Break it down!

CHLOE	Help us. Help us.

UMA	Please, help us. Our friend needs help.

YU	Girls, get the staff. Looks like three little rich girls just wandered into our pool.

UMA	No! Who are you?

YU	We're your substitutes.

CHLOE	What?

YU	You don't understand...how hard we've worked to get here. While you eat cake and pick flowers... we work. We've practiced until we fainted. We've endured dozens of surgeries. All to be like you. To be better than you.

CHLOE	You... You think you're gonna replace me? You bet I will, darlin'.

YU	You don't understand where we come from... what we've done to get here. For every single one of us... this is our only chance at a decent life. We were born out of your wars. We've had to grovel for food. You should at least enjoy the life you've already had.

CHLOE	Yu. Yu.

UMA	Yu?

CHLOE	Yu, no. Yu! Yu! Yu! Yu. Yu? No. Yu?

UMA	Yu?

CHLOE	No, no, no. Please. No. No.

UMA	Well, you got what you wanted. So I guess one of you is gonna replace me, aren't you? Are you listening to me? Are you here? Did they give you hair like mine? Eyes like mine? My mouth? My skin? The scar on my leg? Well, there's one thing they haven't given you. This is my father. Take a good look at him...'cause he's dead...and the man who's paying for you is to blame. You wanna be me? You have to carry that around with you. Always.

YU	Do you believe you're the only one with a story like that? Yeah, we have families too.

CHLOE	Uma, run! Go! Just go!

MALE HEY	Hey!

MALE	Get them! Stop! Get them!

MALE HEY	Get them!
