UMA	I'm yours to keep, your servant I'll cater to you, all your needs Counting all your sins One by one As you hold my stolen heart Our lies ignite the fire But flames are growing higher My ashes at your feet What is this incantation? You were my salvation Everything I need Everything I need

ELOISE	Yes, darling! Good girl! Go, girl! Sing it again!

MALE DRUNK	Sing it again! Sing it again!

ELOISE	Darling, brava!

UMA	Thank you. I'm honored by each and every one of you. Thank you so very much.

YOUNG GUEST	What a stunning bride.

GUEST MAN 1	And what a stupendous wedding.

GUEST MAN 2	There she is. Over here...all back to him now.

UMA	If you'll excuse me a moment.

SON'S ASSISTANT	Mr. Hingston is expecting you upstairs. A husband shouldn't be kept waiting any longer.

GUEST MAN	Your daughter is the epitome of Upper perfection.


GUEST WOMAN 1	She's earned the life ahead of her.

GUEST WOMAN 2	You must be so very proud.

ELOISE	Indeed.

SON	That place works miracles. You could be so difficult before. But now...it's as if that girl never existed.

UMA	What? Hello?

DUCHESS	Good morning, Uma. I didn't mean to startle you.

DUCHESS	Breakfast is on its way.

UMA	Breakfast? Wait, where am I?

DUCHESS	You're in paradise, of course.

ASSISTANT 2	Uma! Uma! Uma!

ASSISTANT 1	Uma!

ASSISTANT 2	Uma! Uma!

AMARNA	New in town?

UMA	Look, I need help, okay? They're chasing me and I need somewhere to hide.

UMA	I don't even know how I got here.

ASSISTANT 2	Uma!

AMARNA	Come with me. Just come with me.

UMA	What is this place?

AMARNA	You lost something?

UMA	What are you doing? No, no, no. Why won't you answer me? What is this place?

JUMP ROPE GIRLS	(SINGING) She asked her mother for 50 cents To see an elephant jump over the fence She asked her mother for 50 cents To see an elephant jump over the fence They jumped so high They reached the sky They never came back Till the 4th of July They jumped so high They reached the sky They never came back Till the 4th of July Higher, higher, higher, higher

UMA	Excuse me, but who are you?

DUCHESS	Some people complain that rosebushes have thorns. I rejoice... that thorn bushes have roses.

UMA	What I am doing here?

DUCHESS	Honey, you have no reason to be afraid. This is a center for emotional healing. Holistic and sustained healing. Now, most of our girls aren't quite so feisty when they arrive... but I do understand how difficult this must be for you.

UMA	Why can't I leave?

DUCHESS	Addressing your anger issues is gonna take a while. Sweetheart, they told me you lost control again last night.

UMA	You can tell my mother that she is wasting her time.

DUCHESS	This is an opportunity, Uma. Relax. Thank you. Observe your life from a new perspective.

UMA	And whose perspective is that? Yours? And what about mine?

DUCHESS	You'll be with us for two months. All I ask in that time is you keep an open mind...and reconsider your marriage proposal after your stay.

ASSISTANT 1	Luggage was arranged by your mother, mademoiselle.

UMA	Do you all talk like that?

CHLOE	Hey! Well, it's about time, darlin'. Hi. Rough trip?

UMA	Actually, I don't remember any of it.

CHLOE	Well, lucky you...'cause that seaplane was sketchier than a broke-ass roller coaster.

UMA	Seaplane?
CHLOE	Yeah. I'm Chloe.

UMA	Uma.

CHLOE	That's Yu. I don't reckon she's too keen on being here.

UMA	What, and you are?

CHLOE	Well, if it'll get my parents off my back.

UMA	What's their problem?

CHLOE	They think two months here is gonna...turn me into some skinny pageant queen like my sisters. It won't, 'cause I'm fine just the way I am. But, hey, I'll take a free vacation. Yu! Yu!

YU	What?

CHLOE	Meet Uma.

UMA	Hi.

YU	They told me no roommates.

CHLOE	Well, hey, that's not our fault, girl.

YU	And don't touch my stuff!

DUCHESS	Let's dress for dinner, ladies.

CHLOE	Okay.

UMA	Where's the rest of it?

WAITER ASSISTANT	Our diet is individually calibrated...for your optimum physical health and your mental equilibrium.

YU	I can't...because I'm lactose intolerant.

WAITER ASSISTANT	Allergies and intolerances have been dutifully accounted for... and, mademoiselle, dairy is not one of yours.

YU	Okay, fine, whatever.

WAITER ASSISTANT	We kindly ask you to finish all of your dinner... to have sufficient nourishment for tomorrow's activities. Bon appétit, mesdemoiselles.

CHLOE	You know her?

UMA	No. She screwed me over as soon as I got here. What? Who is she?

CHLOE	Seriously? (SINGING) If you had my heart I wouldn't want it back I'd let you keep it

CHLOE AND YU	(SINGING) Till the end of time

UMA	Wait, that's her?

CHLOE	Amarna Vicario. Yeah, her new sound is real neat.

CHLOE	She's also...

YU	A drunk.

CHLOE	That's not nice.

YU	It's true.

CHLOE	Look, I hear her parents are super conservative...and they've got get here on detox before they drag her back home. It really must not be easy being famous.

YU	Yeah, it's so not easy being famous.

CHLOE	Think about the pressure. No wonder she drinks, poor thing.

YU	She's kind of tragic.

CHLOE	Don't judge her!

UMA	What do you want?

AMARNA	Still mad about this morning?

UMA	You think?

AMARNA	Well, they were gonna catch you either way... and I couldn't let them find our cave.

UMA	"Our cave"?

AMARNA	Of course. Where else are you gonna light up my cigarettes for me? Hey... Please don't believe everything you hear about me. I don't even drink anymore.

UMA	Then why are you here?

AMARNA	Well... I wanted to do music in my own voice. My team freaked out. You see, they look at me like a product. They planted all those partying stories about me... and sent me here... to rehab for it, I guess.

UMA	Why haven't you tried to escape?

AMARNA	Escape from what?

UMA	I don't know exactly, but I'm not trying to get brainwashed here.

AMARNA	Well, the only thing we've done till now is a lot of yoga and feeling our feelings.

UMA	I don't care. I'm getting out of here.

AMARNA	Well, I don't know how you think you're gonna do that... because we're on an island in the middle of the ocean.

UMA	Tonight.

AMARNA	Okay. I'll help you. Meet me outside my room. Midnight.

UMA	Hey. How do you get cigarettes?

AMARNA	An attendant gives them to me. His daughter's a fan. I video chat with her. You know, Uma...there's always a way to get what you want. Always.

DUCHESS	My dears, the sun is rising...and in the fresh light of this new day... let us welcome Chloe, Yu, and Uma...to our family.

AMARNA	Hey.

UMA	Can you...?

AMARNA	Sure. Sorry, I fell asleep. How long did you wait for me?

UMA	I actually fell asleep, too.

ASSISTANT 1	Please confirm your chosen look.

CHLOE	Hell yes.

YU	No, no. I gotta... I'm gonna just...

ASSISTANT 1	Please, mademoiselle.

YU	Can't do it.

ASSISTANT 1	The look may grow on you.

CHLOE	It looks good.

YU	It isn't me.

UMA	Mommy's perfect little Upper.

AMARNA	You don't have to change who you are, Uma.

ASSISTANT 1	Relax, Uma. This will only take a minute. Please sit still, mademoiselle.

UMA	It's like looking at somebody else.

YU	Yeah...someone I don't like.

DUCHESS	Dearest. How are you adjusting, honey?

UMA	Great. I've always wanted to go to a fascist boarding school...

UMA	so this is kind of a dream come true.

DUCHESS	Well, I certainly hope we can change that for you.

FAVORITE 1	Please sit and face the mirror. Please sit down.

DUCHESS	Uma, I know you think this isn't the place for you... and you may be right. But I'm asking you to be the tiniest bit receptive.

UMA	To your propaganda?

DUCHESS	We are at our best when we are truly ourselves. Can we agree on that? Mirror Therapy is about owning your story. It's about remembering what makes you you. Only the things that you would know. Tell yourself the story of who you truly are.

UMA	You want me to talk to myself?

DUCHESS	Well, you don't seem to enjoy talking to me. How about this? I'll ask you a question. Answer only if you want to, okay? What was the one thing your mother never gave you?

UMA	What?

DUCHESS	Try and look in the mirror. Does she look after you?

UMA	She looks after herself.

DUCHESS	You're very tough on her.

UMA	She deserves it.

DUCHESS	Do you love her?

UMA	What are you trying to do here? Okay, I'm not gonna marry that prick.

DUCHESS	It's hard to find a good man in this world, Uma. I would know.

GYM-KARAOKE	Keep it up, mesdemoiselles. Control of the body, clarity of the mind. All right. And work in pairs now, please.

UMA	Yu. Come on.

YU	No.

UMA	I need a partner.

GYM-KARAOKE	And forward.

UMA	Come on, I can't do this on my own. Come on.

GYM-KARAOKE	And back. And forward. And back. Forward. And back. And back. Uma? Uma. Are you still with us?

UMA	Yeah. Sorry.

GYM-KARAOKE	Okay. And forward. And back.

TECHNICIAN 2	Your gloves, please.

UMA	It's a little tight.

TECHNICIAN 1	It's for your safety. Please.

TECHNICIAN 2	Sorry about that. We're attempting to resolve some technical issues. Please, hang tight.

SON	Lowers like to say all kinds of things about me...but the truth is, I'm a simple man. I work hard...and I give back. I may be a sensitive guy...but don't let anyone tell you I don't know how to have a good time. Maybe my idea of fun can be a bit extreme...but, in both business and life...what's the point of dreaming small? Lowers like to say all kinds of things about me...

UMA	Okay. I get it.

SON	...but the truth is...I'm a simple man.
UMA	I get it!

SON	I work hard...and I give back.

UMA	Hello?

SON	But the truth is, I'm a simple man.

UMA	Can you turn it off?

SON	I work hard.

UMA	Please.

SON	But the truth is...anyone tell you I don't know how to have a good time. Lowers like to say all kinds of things...I'm a simple man, but... Maybe my idea of fun can be a bit extreme...I may be a sensitive guy. I may be a sensitive guy...sensitive guy.

TECHNICIAN 2	We're so sorry. The system failed.

TECHNICIAN 1	We couldn't stop the projection remotely.

TECHNICIAN 2	The infirmary will patch those up.

TECHNICIAN 1	We're so sorry.

UMA	You really think that stupid video is gonna get me to change my mind?

DUCHESS	Oh, honey. Let me take a look at those hands. Come here. Perhaps he is a bit heavy-handed. He means well.

UMA	Means well? He's a sociopath. Besides, it doesn't matter. I'm in love with somebody else.

DUCHESS	Your mother never told me about anyone else.

UMA	Of course not. He's a Lower, so he basically doesn't exist to her.

DUCHESS	Your father was not a good influence, Uma. Look at me. I have dedicated my whole life to taking care of Mother's little garden. But you, if you could learn your place...you have your best years ahead of you. Don't end up like me. So sad! Would you like to help me clip some thorns?

CHLOE	So, your ma just likes him 'cause he's rich?

UMA	She's an Upper, but we're broke. She thinks the marriage will save our family.

YU	That sucks. I'm sorry, dude.

UMA	Am I the only one getting married off here?

YU	I wish all I had to do was marry some rich guy.

UMA	You don't mean that.

CHLOE	Well, my video was people just joggin' and eatin', like, celery. I mean, if it was that easy, everyone would look like Amarna.

AMARNA	Why, thank you, Chloe.

YU	Screw this.

CHLOE	No, hey. ? Here, let me help.

YU	I can't do this. I just can't.

CHLOE	No. What'd they show you in there?

YU	It was a documentary about my thing. I get anxious. Like panic-attack anxious. I feel like I'm dying when I have one. My parents are Lowers. They sent me to Beijing to live with my aunt and uncle. Big shot Uppers. But I just don't know how to act around them. I don't know how to be. I embarrass them. So, they sent me here and told me not to come back until I got better.

CHLOE	Hey, you're not like the other Lowers. You got a choice now.

YU	Yeah, well, maybe my idea of success isn't stepping on everyone below me.

UMA	There, there, my little tapioca pudding. You're in our brave new world now.

AMARNA	We know you've suffered, my peanut, but don't you worry. You most surely will be redeemed...by an excellent hairstyle and a truly mediocre personality.

YU	I hate you guys.

AMARNA	Come on.

CHLOE	Hey!

AMARNA	So, when you go back to Beijing, you're gonna form what?

YU	Sammy. Sammy and the Decapitated Head Horses.

CHLOE	Charming.

AMARNA	Wait, who's Sammy?

YU	I'm Sammy. I formed the band, so...

CHLOE	Wait, you're singin'?

YU	Amarna sings. I do this.

CHLOE	That ain't music!

YU	(SINGING) Yeah, Chloe doesn't like it Thinks it's too crass But she don't know shit Got her head up her ass

CHLOE	Real funny.

YU	Give me my headphones.

DUCHESS	My dearests...the sun is rising.

AMARNA	She visited me the first time the album went platinum.

UMA	We went swimming. Just the two of us. It was a beautiful, clear day... but the current was just too strong.

AMARNA	I told her I was not gonna leave with her. I was gonna stay. She said, "Whatever you want, I want for you."

UMA	She started getting pulled under the waves. I... managed to get her back to shore...and I just wrapped my arms around her.

AMARNA	I wish she meant it. I wish she meant it with every part of my life.

UMA	I was terrified of losing her. Terrified of just being... completely alone.

AMARNA	At that time... those words were just... enough.

UMA	That was the last time I told her I loved her.

AMARNA	...the last time I told her I loved her.

DUCHESS	Very good, Uma. I'm proud of you.

CHLOE	Nice. Now you twist the ends together like this.

AMARNA	When I leave this place...I'm gonna go somewhere far, far away from here. I just wanna be somewhere where I can...start all over again...where nobody really knows who I am. What about you?

UMA	I told you, I'm in love with someone. We just want to be together... and have a simple life.

CHLOE	Uma, isn't that a memory locket?

UMA	It's the prototype for all the rest.

CHLOE	They still make them?

UMA	Not the way my dad used to. How did you...?

MARKUS	I promised I'd find you.

UMA	How did you even find me?

MARKUS	Showed up at your mother's place. She was not happy to see me.

UMA	What did she say?

MARKUS	That you were getting ready to marry Son.

UMA	Look, I'm not marrying him. I told her that.

MARKUS	I know, I know. I applied for the job as soon as I could. Listen, Uma. I'm gonna get you off this island. No. Not here. Swiped this from the tech guys. The feed will just show an empty room, same as before. Listen. I'm gonna join the cargo crew. And when I do, I'll sneak you into the hold. We'll fly to the mainland and I'll get you off that plane.

UMA	And go where?

MARKUS	We'll figure it out. As long as we're together. Is that what you want, too?

CHLOE	What? That is so romantic! I mean, he came all this way for you?

YU	Just in time to save you from that shit-stick you're supposed to marry.

AMARNA	Uma doesn't need saving.

UMA	He's gonna help me escape.

AMARNA	You just have to be nice to the staff, fake the treatments. You don't need to escape.

UMA	I finally have a partner in all of this.

AMARNA	And what am I? You shouldn't trust that guy, Uma.

UMA	I've known him my entire life.

AMARNA	Well, I don't think he deserves you.

UMA	How would you know?

GYM-KARAOKE	Amarna! You're up, girl!

CHLOE AND YU	Go, Amarna!

AMARNA	Stop the music, please. I'm yours to keep, your servant I'll cater to you, all your needs Counting all your sins One by one As you hold my stolen heart Our lies ignite the fire Our flames are burning higher What is this incantation? You were my salvation Everything I need  Everything I need 

AMARNA	What is this incantation?

GYM KARAOKE	All right, all right. That's enough, now.

AMARNA	You were my salvation

GYM KARAOKE	Amarna?

AMARNA	Everything I need

GYM KARAOKE	Amarna! Hello? I said that's enough!

AMARNA	Everything I need

GYM-KARAOKE	Bedtime, mesdemoiselles.

RESIDENT GIRLS	No!

RESIDENT GIRL	Go away!

GYM-KARAOKE	Offstage, go. Listen, I don't want to repeat it. Just go.


CHLOE	Just once...can she play some shit that isn't, like, 100 years old?

UMA	Have you seen my necklace? My locket?

CHLOE	No.

MALE P.A.	Security perimeter breach. Security perimeter breach.

MALE P.A.	Interfering boat type 0-0-1-2.

CHLOE	Look at these clowns.

MALE P.A.	Male subject. All safety personnel to Beach A3. Interns are to initiate regular morning activities. Security instructions will...

ASSISTANT 1	Girls! The showers! Now! Come on, mesdemoiselles, move it!

MALE P.A.	Please, resume standard procedures. Repeat, perimeter breach. 

CHLOE	What's that boat doing here?

UMA	No clue.

DUCHESS	It's unacceptable. Who is this intruder? Fetch him. Fetch him at once! Why are you still here? Go and wash yourselves!

UMA	Whose boat is that?

DUCHESS	Are you deaf?

UMA	Well, I was just asking whose boat...

DUCHESS	Okay, get out of here. Go, go, go. Come on. Come on.

YU	Hey! Back off!

DUCHESS	What did you say?

YU	I said back off.

UMA	Yu!

DUCHESS	Don't you ever touch me again. I will send you home to your family a failure, a disgrace. Is that what you want? Is it?

AMARNA	Enough. Stop. I said stop! If she leaves, we all leave. You hear me?

CHLOE	Yeah. We'll tell everybody about this.

DUCHESS	I am so sorry. I lost my composure. We are dealing with a situation this morning. Thank you so much for helping me. Find him. And turn off this ridiculous alarm.

UMA	It's okay. Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe.

CHLOE	It's okay.

UMA	Okay.

RESIDENT GIRL 1	Look, there he is.

RESIDENT GIRL 4	The mystery man.

RESIDENT GIRL 1	He ran the boat straight into the rocks like he wanted to crash.

RESIDENT GIRL 2	She interrogated him herself. I can't even imagine.

RESIDENT GIRL 4	I heard he wanted to see Amarna. That he demanded an audience.

RESIDENT GIRL 2	A superfan.

RESIDENT GIRL 1	A super creep.

AMARNA	So, the attendant that gets me the cigs lets me use his station... in exchange for passes to my comeback show.

UMA	That guy sailed all the way here to see you?

AMARNA	Not exactly.

UMA	Holy shit.

AMARNA	That's what he really came to do.

UMA	How?

AMARNA	Uma, there's no stalker. It was all a front. My admirer stashed the rowboat here and sailed around the island all night... but nobody spotted him till dawn. They're not guarding the coast at night. That's our way outta here. We come here after dinner, we get on the rowboat, and we go to shore. It's only 10 miles. We can do it. Uma! Please.

UMA	I thought you didn't want to leave at all. What's changed?

AMARNA	Last night I was able to stay awake for the first time since we've been here. You know why? 'Cause I didn't drink the milk. They've been drugging us every night. They make us sleep like we're dead. But the Residence isn't sleeping.

UMA	Where did you find this?

AMARNA	It was in the patio, by the mermaid. There was staff that I didn't even recognize...wheeling passed-out girls around.

UMA	What?

AMARNA	Listen, we have to go. Tonight. We don't drink our milk, and we meet here after curfew.

UMA	I have to tell Markus.

AMARNA	No, Uma, you can't.

UMA	I can't disappear on him again.

AMARNA	Okay. Just don't give him any details.

MARKUS	Listen. They're gonna transfer me to the cargo crew tomorrow. We'll be out of here in a couple of weeks, maybe less. Wow, don't get too excited.

UMA	I am. It's just...

MARKUS	What?

UMA	I have to tell you something.
FAVORITE 1	Mesdemoiselles, your attention, please. Once in a blue moon... a resident is so receptive to what we offer... that she's ready to rejoin her loved ones sooner than expected. And so it is with our own... Amarna.

FAVORITE 2	We shouldn't be sad to see her leave us this evening. We should instead let our hearts swell with joy... at the strong young woman Amarna has become during her time here. To Amarna.

AMARNA	Uma. Uma. Listen to me, okay? You take that boat with Markus. It's yours.

UMA	But how will I find you? What?

AMARNA	Hey. You promise, right?

UMA	I promise.

AMARNA	I'll see you there, okay?

ASSISTANT 1	Amarna! Time to go.

AMARNA	Yeah, I'm coming. Be safe.

YOUNG NURSE	They should be grateful.

YOUNG NURSE	Yeah?

OLD NURSE	Yeah. Isn't this ugly?

YOUNG NURSE	What the hell? How did she get all the way over here?

OLD NURSE	The sedative's slow sometimes. It hits them on the way to the bathroom.

YOUNG NURSE	We taking her to the OR?

OLD NURSE	No, it's not her turn tonight.

CHLOE	What's up with you?

UMA	I'm fine.

CHLOE	Yeah? 'Cause you're scaring the mirror.

UMA	I just had weird dreams last night.

CHLOE	Really? I ain't never had a dream here.

FEMALE ANCHOR	The beloved artisan apparently took his own life last night...financially ruined by the hostile takeover of his family-owned business.

MALE ANCHOR	...Son Hingston orchestrated the purchase...

UMA	Stop!

MALE ANCHOR	...and removed Mr. Stowe...

UMA	Turn it off!


MALE ANCHOR	...after a lengthy and costly legal battle.

UMA	Turn it off!

FEMALE ANCHOR	Mr. Hingston fired the staff...and automated the factory.

MALE INTERVIEWER	Son, what about Mr. Stowe's widow and daughter?

UMA	Let me down!

MALE INTERVIEWER	Don't you care what happens to them?

SON	Of course. I've made the necessary arrangements.

UMA	Let me out of here!

MALE INTERVIEWER	Son, can you give us anything more?

FEMALE ANCHOR	Some could say...

UMA	Let me down!

FEMALE ANCHOR	...you've ruined the Stowe legacy.

UMA	Turn if off!

FEMALE ANCHOR	How do you respond?

UMA	This place is a fucking lie! What are you doing to us? What are you doing to us?

TECHNICIAN 1	Wait!

ASSISTANT 1	Mademoiselle, stop!

UMA	No, stop it! You're lying to us! Why are you lying?

TECHNICIAN 1	Mademoiselle, be still!

YU	Uma!

UMA	Why are you lying?

YU	Where are you taking her?

UMA	Yu!

TECHNICIAN 2	We don't wish to hurt you, mademoiselle.

UMA	Please! Markus! Help me!

FAVORITE 1	Easy, Uma.

FAVORITE 2	Sit. Finish it.

DUCHESS	Why don't you drink me?

FAVORITE 1	Good morning, Uma.

UMA	What's going on? What? No, no, no! Let me go!
MALE JOURNALIST	How about a kiss? Yeah, give us a kiss, come on!

DUCHESS	Well... isn't that a pickle? You think this place is a lie? Look at your friend. Her treatment seems rather effective in the end, don't you think? I think both her label and her family will be very, very pleased with the result. You gotta see this. This is what Son paid... to have you skip our waiting list. Do you think he would spend so much money on something that doesn't work? Understand this. The therapy is real. You're just a prickly little pear. And now, you're done.

UMA	What are you talking about?

DUCHESS	We're nearly finished with you, Uma. By tomorrow, you'll be able to leave here forever.

UMA	Tomorrow?

DUCHESS	Frankly, I thought you'd be happier. I was under the impression you couldn't wait to go.

UMA	How long have I been asleep?

DUCHESS	How long have you been asleep? One... No, two weeks. Run along now, little bug. Your friends miss you.

CHLOE	Sure you're okay?

UMA	Yes.

YU	They told us you went nuts... that you broke that dumb horse. Is that true?

UMA	Okay, look, forget about all of that.

UMA	The Amarna we said goodbye to is not the Amarna I saw on TV. They did something to her. And I'm not waiting around for them to do it to me. I'm leaving... and I want you two to come with me.

CHLOE	How?

UMA	Tonight. We throw up our milk, we sneak out of the Residence... and we row this fricking boat to the mainland.

YU	And then what? I can't go home until I'm cured. My aunt and uncle will throw me out.

UMA	So don't go home.

CHLOE	What do you mean?

UMA	I know somewhere else. Somewhere safe. Look, our families sent us here to shape us in their image. Not ours. I'm not doing it. Are you with me?

CHLOE	Screw 'em.

UMA	Come with us.

YU	I can't.

CHLOE	It's okay. But we'll be waiting for you tonight if you change your mind.

UMA	Yeah.

MARKUS	It's my fault. I should've tried to join the crew sooner...

UMA	It's only three more days.

MARKUS	Listen, I will be on the next plane out next week. I'll meet you on the mainland... and I swear, I will never let anything tear us apart again.

UMA	Okay.

MARKUS	Yeah?

UMA	I'll wait for you.

WAITER ASSISTANT	Mademoiselle, finish your dinner, please.

CHLOE	I gotta take a leak.

UMA	Yu!

YU	I'm not the one that needs to change.

UMA	Ready?

NURSE 1	These girls are supposed to be completed. She's done. She's done. Wait, this one's still got one session left.

NURSE 2	Okay, let's get to it.

CHLOE	What do we do?

UMA	We can't leave her behind. Come on.

CHLOE	Okay, wait. That way.

UMA	Okay.

NURSE 1	Head right, huh?

CHLOE	Let's go.

NURSE 1	First off, your boat's a piece of shit.

NURSE 2	God damn it. It's not fair.

NURSE 1	Secondly, you got zero patience.

NURSE 2	Wait. We gotta update the log.

NURSE 1	Jeez. Can we wait till after dinner? Im starving, man.

NURSE 2	Let's just get it over with, huh?

NURSE 1	Fine.

NURSE 2	You say I've got no patience...but you're the one that's always gotta eat so bad.

SENIOR SURGEON	Vocal cords, as well as a scan of the pupil and iris. Yo, is she roommates with that fat Southern girl? I think so. Why?

JUNIOR SURGEON	Don't know, I kinda like that one. I feel sorry for her, though.

SENIOR SURGEON	What about the ones you don't like? You don't feel sorry for them?

JUNIOR SURGEON	Yeah, well, if I felt sorry for all of them... this job would be un-fricking-bearable.


UMA	Chloe!

CHLOE	Let her go, douche-canoes!

JUNIOR SURGEON	Christ, man, call her!

DUCHESS	What is it?

SENIOR SURGEON	Two girls are awake.

YU	Chloe!

SENIOR SURGEON	They're here in the OR!


DUCHESS	Who?

SENIOR SURGEON	Mademoiselle Yu's roommates. She's also awake!

DUCHESS 	Do I need to hold your hand? They're completed. Finish them off.

UMA	No! Chloe!

SENIOR SURGEON	We may need some help here.

YU	Uma! Uma!

UMA	Yu! Yu! Yu, breathe!

SENIOR SURGEON	I'm only doing my job.

JUNIOR SURGEON	Easy, sweetheart.

UMA	Yu! Yu. Yu.

CHLOE	Yu. Yu. Yu.

UMA	It's okay. It's okay.

CHLOE	Come here. I got you.

UMA	Here. Here.

CHLOE 	You're okay. Come on. It's okay. It's okay.

UMA	What is that?

CHLOE	Come on.

UMA	Put her over here.

CHLOE	What?


JUMP ROPE GIRLS	(SINGING) Higher, higher, higher, higher

YU	I don't know how to be. I embarrass them.

FEMALE LOOK RESIDENT	Every time I look at myself. Whoops.

DUCHESS	Observe your life from a new perspective.

UMA	And whose perspective is that? Yours?

YU	I don't know how to be. I embarrass them. I embarrass them.

TECHNICIAN 2	Hang tight.

UMA	He's a Lower, so he basically doesn't exist to her.

SON	Lowers like to say all kinds of things about me.

UMA	They're not treating us. Can someone let me down? They've been observing us. Measuring every single thing about who we are. He's a sociopath.

CHLOE	But why? I mean, what's all this for? Yu? Yu, Yu. We need to find a way outta here. Okay.

UMA	What are you doing to us? Let me out of here! Let me down! Turn it off! I'm in love with somebody else.

CHLOE	This way.

UMA	That lying piece of shit.

CHLOE	Uma! We've gotta go. We gotta go now.

MALE	Get them!

CHLOE	Uma, now!

MALE	Get them! Hey!

UMA	No!

MALE	Stop! Open up, you punks! Open the door! Break it down!

CHLOE	Help us. Help us.

UMA	Please, help us. Our friend needs help.

YU	Girls, get the staff. Looks like three little rich girls just wandered into our pool.

UMA	No! Who are you?

YU	We're your substitutes.

CHLOE	What?

YU	You don't understand...how hard we've worked to get here. While you eat cake and pick flowers... we work. We've practiced until we fainted. We've endured dozens of surgeries. All to be like you. To be better than you.

CHLOE	You... You think you're gonna replace me? You bet I will, darlin'.

YU	You don't understand where we come from... what we've done to get here. For every single one of us... this is our only chance at a decent life. We were born out of your wars. We've had to grovel for food. You should at least enjoy the life you've already had.

CHLOE	Yu. Yu.

UMA	Yu?

CHLOE	Yu, no. Yu! Yu! Yu! Yu. Yu? No. Yu?

UMA	Yu?

CHLOE	No, no, no. Please. No. No.

UMA	Well, you got what you wanted. So I guess one of you is gonna replace me, aren't you? Are you listening to me? Are you here? Did they give you hair like mine? Eyes like mine? My mouth? My skin? The scar on my leg? Well, there's one thing they haven't given you. This is my father. Take a good look at him...'cause he's dead...and the man who's paying for you is to blame. You wanna be me? You have to carry that around with you. Always.

YU	Do you believe you're the only one with a story like that? Yeah, we have families too.

CHLOE	Uma, run! Go! Just go!

MALE HEY	Hey!

MALE	Get them! Stop! Get them!

MALE HEY	Get them!

MALE HEY	Open the door! Open the door! Break it down!

UMA	Okay.

CHLOE	Okay.

UMA	Come on.

CHLOE	What is this? It's okay. You keep going. Come on.

UMA	Chloe? Chloe! Chloe, where are you?

CHLOE	Uma! Uma! Uma! Uma!

UMA	Chloe? Chloe?

DUCHESS	Uma.

UMA	What are you?

DUCHESS	I'm just like you. A nasty little thorn in Mother's side.

DUCHESS	(SINGING) Five little bugs came out to play On a spider's web one day They got caught, all in a bunch And along I came In time for lunch!  At Mother's age, I can't exactly stop now, can I? Who'd want me then? Who'd want me then?

UMA	Leave her alone! I said leave her alone.

DUCHESS	Isn't this cute? A family reunion.

UMA	That's my substitute, you idiot. I'm the one you want. No, I'm the one you want. Don't listen. She's lying to you. That's my substitute. I'm the one you're looking for. How can you not recognize me? Don't listen to her. It's me, liar. Liar! I'm the one you want!

DUCHESS	Enough! Now... which one are you?

UMA	I am me.

MALE MISSING	We're still missing one substitute. Keep searching.

MARKUS	Copy. Uma. Uma. She lied to me. She told me that you chose him. She told me that you chose Son over me.

UMA	How much did she pay you?

MARKUS	I won't take it.

MALE MISSING	All clear over there, partner? Partner?

MARKUS	Yes, sir. All clear.

UMA	Here. This belongs to you. Thank you. What are you gonna do now? There's nothing left where I came from. Your parents? I tried to take care of my two little brothers... but 16 hours a day working in a factory, it wasn't enough. This man came to our town and offered me this job... if you can call it a job. He promised me my brothers would never go hungry again. I had to become somebody else so I could survive. I had to become you. I'm sorry. What's your name? Anna. It's nice to meet you, Anna.

DRUNK GUEST	Sing it again, sweetheart!

YOUNG GUEST	What a stunning bride.

GUEST MAN 1	And what a stupendous wedding. Your daughter is the epitome of Upper perfection.

GUEST WOMAN 1	She's earned the life ahead of her.

GUEST WOMAN 2	You must be so very proud.

ELOISE	Indeed.

GUEST MAN 2	And here she is. He was heartbroken... when you were the only one who went missing after that disaster. Only a man in love can suffer like that.

GUEST WOMAN 3	You should feel fortunate.

UMA	I do. Very much so. I just can't imagine how difficult it must've been for him. I mean, he's invested so much in me.

GUEST MAN 2	Smile, kid. You're giving it all back to him now.

SON'S ASSISTANT	Mr. Hingston is expecting you upstairs.  A husband shouldn't be kept waiting any longer.

SON	That place works miracles. You could be so difficult before. But now... it's as if that girl never existed.

UMA	Please, don't worry. I'll go.

ELOISE	Uma! Uma! Baby, what happened?
