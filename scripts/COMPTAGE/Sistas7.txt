(“Boy Bye”)
(Episode 107)

FAWN	I went to her this morning.	
AARON	You went to see Karen?	
WOMAN	Previously on Sistas.	
FAWN	I asked her to give us six months.  I don't wanna lose you.	
AARON	Will you sign the damn papers?	
FAWN	I love you.	
AARON	Fawn, sign the damn papers.	
FAWN	I love you.	
AARON	Now!	
KAREN	What's gotten into you?  Have anything to do with them red panties?	
SABRINA	I got so turned off when I saw them.	
ZAC	Karen.	
DANNI	What about her?	
ZAC	I need to be sure that we're done.	
SABRINA	They're divorced.  As of tomorrow, he is a free man.	
KAREN	After Zac, I don't got no time for that, okay?	
AARON	I don't know how to go slow.  I don't know how to pace myself or play games.  Forgive me.	
KAREN	Bye.  What the hell?	
AARON	What?	
KAREN	You just kissed me.	
AARON	I didn't see you resisting.	
ZAC	Neither did I.	
AARON	Who's that?	
KAREN	Nobody.	
AARON	Wow.  Really?	
KAREN	That's what I said.	
ZAC	That's what you say?	
AARON	Yo, I'm sorry.  I'm Aaron.	
ZAC	You move on that quick?	
KAREN	Yeah.  Now be gone.	
ZAC	Got it.	
KAREN	I know you ain't got no damn attitude with me.	
ZAC	You know, I'm crazy as hell to come back here for you.	
KAREN	Well.	
ZAC	I'm out.  I'm so damn stupid.  What's your name again, man?	
KAREN	None of your damn business.	
ZAC	You see that?  You see that, right?  That's what you--you see how she talks to me?  She makes me feel like I'm nothing.  And no, my stupid ass is back here always trying to get back in the…	
KAREN	Trying to what?	
ZAC	Exactly.  Exactly.	
KAREN	Your ass is here?  Because of what?  Hmm?  She put you out?	
ZAC	No, she didn't.	
KAREN	Then go ahead and be with that ho.	
ZAC	Fine.  I'm out.	
KAREN	Good.  Be that.  Be out.	
ZAC	Fine.	
KAREN	Broke ass ain't even got a car.	
ZAC	That's because I like to exercise.	
KAREN	No, it's because you credit is shot and I've been supporting you this whole damn time, Zac.	
ZAC	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, still talking.	
KAREN	Go!	
ZAC	So--you know, yo, look at his face.  Look--look at his face, look at my man, he's gonna be going, too.	
KAREN	You know what?  Get your ass moving out here.	
ZAC	Yo, you know why he's gonna be going?  Every time you get a man, you wanna take his balls from him.  Every time.	
KAREN	I ain't never had a man when I was with you, so how would you know?  Hmm?	
ZAC	I'm crazy as hell to come back here.	
KAREN	Boy, bye.  I hope you get a flat, too.	
SINGER	All of my girls hold me down, let them boys mess around, and my love life is a headache, we're going out tonight, because I'm greater than love.	
KAREN	Don't worry about him, he's…	
AARON	Yo, what's up with, uh…	
KAREN	Don't--just shut up and come inside.  Come on, just…	
AARON	What?	
KAREN	Shut up and come in.  You're not coming?	
AARON	Don't tell me to shut up.  All right?  I'm not some damn dog.	
KAREN	Okay, fine.  Fine.	
AARON	And don't call me until you know how to speak to a man.	
KAREN	What did you just say?	
AARON	You know, I don't know what that was right there, but I'm not that dude.  Okay, I will never be that dude.	
KAREN	Oh, well, thank God.	
AARON	No, hold on.  I won't be that dude in any life.  So to think that you would treat me in the way you just treated him.	
KAREN	What the hell are you talking about?	
AARON	That right there.  That, "What the hell?" and "Shut up."  No, sista, look, I ain't the one, okay?  That won't work for me.	
KAREN	Wait.  What?	
AARON	Be careful.	
KAREN	I don't understand what you're talking about.  I--I--I don't know what the hell are you talking about.	
AARON	See, just be careful.  Because I don't care how upset you get with him, do not put his stuff on me.	
KAREN	I didn't do that.	
AARON	Oh, shut up.	
KAREN	Who the hell are you telling to shut up?	
AARON	You.  With your broke ass.	
KAREN	Look.  You came over here.  I didn't invite you over, okay?	
AARON	Are you upset?  You angry?  Because I'm using your words to talk to you like you just talked to him.	
KAREN	Okay.	
AARON	So how'd that make you feel, huh?  Small?  Reductive?	
KAREN	You know what?  You don't get this.  You're not getting this.	
AARON	I'm talking about getting it.  I'm talking about getting this feeling.  I'm talking how someone so beautiful can let words fall out of her mouth to tear somebody down rather than lift him up.	
KAREN	He cheated on me.	
AARON	So what?  So what?  My wife cheated on me.  I still choose my words not to destroy her.	
KAREN	Oh, well, hooray.  You better than me.	
AARON	My God, it's not about being better.  Karen, it is about being aware.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I bombarded you.  Right, I'm sorry I kissed you.  I'm sorry your boyfriend walked up.	
KAREN	He's not my boyfriend.	
AARON	Go on and lie to yourself.	
KAREN	He's not.  I moved on.  We're done.	
AARON	Look, there is too much passion there for you to be done.  You are too upset and you're…look, I know that space.  You're too raw for me to touch you.  It really has been nice to meet you.  And I wish you the best.	
KAREN	I don't give a damn.	
LISA	They pissed you off, didn't they?	
KAREN	Mama, what you doing here?	
LISA	Well, didn't you see my bike out there?  I came to get my rubber stuff that you seem to completely forget to bring back to me.	
KAREN	Oh.  I'm sorry.	
LISA	What was that all about?	
KAREN	Uh, how much did you hear?	
LISA	Well, that window was open.  So--look, it's none of my business.	
KAREN	Zac just got pissed, that's all.	
LISA	So you're cheating on him.	
KAREN	No.	
LISA	Oh, so you weren't getting even with the cute accountant?	
KAREN	He's not an accountant.	
LISA	Well, dump him.	
KAREN	Why?	
LISA	Well, I slept with him.	
KAREN	Mama!	
LISA	Look, no, I'm kidding.  I don't even know who he is.  But he sure is cute.  Where did you meet him?	
KAREN	The supermarket.	
LISA	Is he married?	
KAREN	No.	
LISA	You sure he's not married?  He sure smells married.	
KAREN	What does that mean, mama?	
LISA	Baby, you know, I can spot them from a mile away.  Just like that Gary man that Andrea is seeing.	
KAREN	Okay.  But if she calls you, you don't know that much.	
LISA	No, no, I got it.	
KAREN	Please.	
LISA	No, no, I got it.  I got it.	
KAREN	He's getting a divorce.	
LISA	Oh.	
KAREN	Mama, don't give me that look, okay?  Andi's taking care of it.	
LISA	So you moved on from Zac?	
KAREN	Yes.	
LISA	But Zac walked up and saw you with the cute accountant?	
KAREN	He's not an accountant.	
LISA	Okay.  Then what does he do?	
KAREN	I don't know actually.	
LISA	Well, whatever he does, it's sterile.	
KAREN	What does that mean?	
LISA	It means your mama knows best.	
KAREN	Okay, well, I would agree.  But I have no idea what you're talking about.  You've been smoking today, mama?	
LISA	No.	
KAREN	Be honest.	
LISA	No.  No, no, no, no.  Because I'm on my Harley.	
KAREN	Oh, okay.  Good.	
LISA	But I do have a big flat blunt waiting for me when I get back home.	
KAREN	Mama.	
LISA	What?	
KAREN	Tell me.	
LISA	What you want me to tell you?	
KAREN	You think I'm moving too fast?	
LISA	Oh, baby, that's a decision you have to make.	
KAREN	He cheated on me, mama.	
LISA	Okay.	
KAREN	Don't just say "Okay."	
LISA	Oh, baby, look, every time a man breaks your heart don't think that your heart's gonna stop beating just because he's not in your life anymore.	
KAREN	I'm supposed to just let him walk all over me?	
LISA	No.	
KAREN	You never did that.	
LISA	No.  No, I didn't.  Um, and I thought there were some men that wanted to walk all over me.  But in truth, they loved me and they just needed to figure out their own shit.  Your daddy was one of them.  Look, men don't mature like we do.  They--they're slow.  It's kind of like pregnancy.  When--when they've--when they matured and they're ready, they'll arrive.  At least most of them will.	
KAREN	So I'm supposed to just let them sleep with whoever he wants 'till he figures it out?	
LISA	No, you're supposed to do what you think is best for you.	
KAREN	I hate when you say that, mama.  I hate when you say that.	
LISA	And I hate when you don't bring my rubber shit back on time.	
KAREN	I'm sorry.	
LISA	I love you.	
KAREN	Wait.  What--mama, what am I supposed to do?	
LISA	All right.  Well, first, I would apologize to the cute accountant.	
KAREN	I'm not calling.	
LISA	You know, he was right.	
KAREN	I'm not calling him, mama.	
LISA	Okay, fine.  I knew you'd say that.  So I'm done with advice.  I'm going camping with Jose.	
KAREN	Who's Jose?	
LISA	Just somebody I'm doing.  Look, I left his information right there in case, uh, I disappear.	
KAREN	Don't say that, mama.  Where'd you meet him?	
LISA	Coachella.  When Beyonce was there.	
KAREN	When was that?	
LISA	Well, you think I would take you to Coachella?  With me?	
KAREN	Mom.	
LISA	On the back of my bike?  I care for you too much for that.  All right.  I'm outta here.	
KAREN	But mama, what am I supposed to do?	
LISA	Tell the girls I said hi.	
KAREN	Mama.  Mom.	
LISA	Bye.	
KAREN	Ma.  You can't just drop in like that.	
LISA	Yeah, I can.	
KAREN	But not if I--love you, too.	
LISA	Love you.	
KAREN	Jose?	
DANNI	What the hell is wrong with you?	
ZAC	Oh, oh, I am so sorry.  I did not know you were home.	
DANNI	Well, we come in this house slamming the damn doors, the damn landlord is downstairs.	
ZAC	(whispers) I'm sorry.	
DANNI	(whispers) That old bitch can hear like a bat.	
ZAC	(whispers) I'm sorry.  Why are we whispering?	
DANNI	(whispers) Think.  The landlord lives downstairs, stupid.	
ZAC	(whispers) Okay.	
DANNI	What is wrong with you?	
ZAC	Can I ask you a question?	
DANNI	Sure.	
ZAC	Why do I listen to you?	
DANNI	I'm smart and I'm cute.	
ZAC	Oh, this damn girl.	
DANNI	What?  What happened?	
ZAC	I went to her house.	
DANNI	Karen?	
ZAC	No.  Bozo the Clown.  Of course I'm talking about Karen.	
DANNI	Well, don't be getting smart.  It ain't like you was messing with that thot.	
ZAC	Can you just listen?  I went over there to talk to her, I show up, and she's on the street kissing some Mex dude.	
DANNI	What?	
ZAC	Wait a minute.  You knew.	
DANNI	Knew what?	
ZAC	She was seeing somebody.	
DANNI	No, I didn't.	
ZAC	I get it.  Y'all playing me.	
DANNI	Boy, will you stop being so paranoid.	
ZAC	Is the biggest pothead in Atlanta telling me to stop being so paranoid?	
DANNI	That's cute.  Why don't you just tell me what happened.	
ZAC	I just told you.	
DANNI	Well, who's the guy?	
ZAC	Some  named Aaron.	
DANNI	Okay, what's he look like?	
ZAC	Like  named Aaron.  Hell.	
DANNI	I don't know what to think about it.	
ZAC	Sure.	
DANNI	I didn't.  She holds out on me.  Her and Andi.	
ZAC	You know what?  I don't even care.  Y'all like--fine, if she wanna be with him, she could be with him.	
DANNI	I mean, you didn't even think she still wanted to be with you, did you?	
ZAC	I don't know what I thought.  Hell, I'm confused, though.  You know what I want, though?  You got any more?	
DANNI	Of what?	
ZAC	What you gave me last night.  Come on, Danni.  Stop lying.	
DANNI	I don't.	
ZAC	Come on, Danni.	
DANNI	No.  When you smoke that kinda weed, you be tripping.	
ZAC	I get it.  So one toke, please.	
DANNI	No.	
ZAC	I get it.  I get it.  You scared I'm gonna start talking shit, right?	
DANNI	I ain't scared of shit.  So you can do what you want.  I'm going out to Freddy D's.	
ZAC	With who?	
DANNI	The girls.	
ZAC	She brining him?	
DANNI	You really need to relax.  It's not cute.	
ZAC	So give me some, then.	
DANNI	I wish you meant something else, but here.  Fine.  Don't take too many hits.	
ZAC	I got this.	
DANNI	Because that hybrid is--is…	
ZAC	I got this.  I knew she's gonna bringing him over.	
DANNI	Zac…	
ZAC	I got to go to the bathroom.	
DANNI	Oh, give me my pen, give me my pen, give me my pen.	
ZAC	Use your other one.	
DANNI	Boy, don't play with me.	
ZAC	You look nice.	
DANNI	I know.  But still give me my pen.  Come on, man.	
IRENE	Hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't know there's anyone here.	
ANDI	I was just about to leave.	
IRENE	Oh, I'll--I'll come back.	
ANDI	No, come on.	
IRENE	Are you sure?	
ANDI	Yes.	
IRENE	I would have thought a pretty young thing like you would be at home with her husband.	
ANDI	I'm not married.	
IRENE	I see.	
ANDI	You said, "I see."  Now, what do you see?	
IRENE	Oh, darling, don't mind me.  I'm just an old lady here to clean the office.	
ANDI	I am sure you're more than that.  Everyone has a story.	
IRENE	Yes, we do.	
ANDI	What's yours?	
IRENE	You're working.  You don't wanna hear about me.	
ANDI	No, I do.	
IRENE	Well, I'm an educator.	
ANDI	You are?	
IRENE	Does that surprise you?	
ANDI	I just didn't expect you to…	
IRENE	No.  Other time, a long time ago, and I don't like sitting around so I started this cleaning service with my son.	
ANDI	With your son?	
IRENE	Uh-hmm.  Yeah.  You should meet him.	
ANDI	Oh.  No.  (laughs)	
IRENE	He's a handsome thing.  He's having a hard time finding a woman which it's pretty easy in a city like this where the women outnumber the men.	
ANDI	You would think so, right?	
IRENE	Are you seeing anyone?	
ANDI	(laughs) Yes, I am.	
IRENE	Oh, well that's too bad.  His loss.  You're a pretty girl and a good person.	
ANDI	How do you know that?	
IRENE	Your trash.	
ANDI	I'm sorry, I don't understand.	
IRENE	You can tell a lot about a person with what's in their trash can.  Not that I go looking in people's trash but some of the folks around here, disgusting.  But you, you take care.  You put things in the can.  You recycle.  You don't chew gum.  And if something is bad or rotten you double bag it.  You're a good girl.  Your mama raised you right.	
ANDI	She will be glad to hear that.	
IRENE	No.  Look, I'm sorry, I'm gonna let you get back to work.	
ANDI	Oh, thank you for that.	
IRENE	For what?	
ANDI	For reminding me of who I am.	
IRENE	Oh, baby, it didn't take me to do that.  There's a mirror right there.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
IRENE	Sure.	
DANNI	Zac, I'm not playing a game.  Give me my pen.	
ZAC	(shouting) Huh?  Hello?	
DANNI	I have to use the bathroom.	
ZAC	I'm using it.	
DANNI	(shouting) Give me my pen.	
ZAC	I can't hear you.	
DANNI	You know what…	
ZAC	It's too loud.  Damn.	
DANNI	Give me my hat before you get it wet.  What the hell is wrong with you?	
ZAC	Watch that knife.	
DANNI	I ought to cut your fingers off.	
ZAC	Don't play like that please.	
DANNI	Give me my pen.	
ZAC	You want the pen, you want the hat, is there anything else I can help you with?	
DANNI	Well, you are naked already.	
ZAC	You know what?  This looks like an old married couple, right?	
DANNI	No, no we don't.  No.	
ZAC	No, actually, we do.  Give me this, give me that, give me this, give me that.	
DANNI	This is my house.	
ZAC	Okay, Karen.	
DANNI	No.  My name is Daniella.	
ZAC	Karen.  Your name is Karen, doing the same thing she did to me.  Always telling me what's hers.  (claps) What--what did you buy?  What did you buy?  What did you buy?	
DANNI	Well, if you bought something maybe she wouldn't have to say that.	
ZAC	Whoa.  I can't feel my face.	
DANNI	Yeah.  You're an idiot.  You smoked too much.	
ZAC	I need some more.	
DANNI	Give me my pen, man.	
ZAC	You ain't giving me nothing.  Karen, sure as hell ain't giving me nothing because she giving it to old boy.	
DANNI	I know you're not sitting there jealous.	
ZAC	No, look at me, I got a cowboy hat on, taking a bath.	
DANNI	Well, you better not be because you're the one that screwed that up.	
ZAC	Oh, my gosh.  Karen reminded me that every day, what you gonna do now too, you're gonna remind me too?	
DANNI	Uh, you know, honestly, Zac, I don't wanna hear this, okay?  So just give me my stuff.	
ZAC	Why you don't wanna hear it, are you jealous?

DANNI	Like what?	
ZAC	Hmm, snitches get stitches.	
DANNI	Who's holding a knife?  Because I could just, you know…	
ZAC	Okay.  Only because you have a knife.	
DANNI	Good.  You smart man.	
ZAC	She'd be talking about how you out of all the friends, the only one that didn't use your degree, that she'd be talking about how out of all the friends you'd be talking about how you on a diet but you eat everything you see.  That's true.  She'd be talking about how you can keep a man…

ANDI	What?	
IRENE	Yes.	
ANDI	 Okay.  I'll be back.  You shouldn't be here.	
GARY	But it's late.  I figured nobody would be here.	
ANDI	And what if one of the partners were here, hmm?	
GARY	Well, you should've returned my calls.	
ANDI	Gary, this is a bad idea.	
GARY	Just tell me when you're coming home.	
ANDI	I'm going out with the girls tonight.	
GARY	I can go to a hotel if I'm invading your space.	
ANDI	You act as if she hasn't hired some PI that's tracking your every move.  You should not have come here, Gary.	
GARY	Well, just tell her that I'm--tell her I'm looking for a divorce attorney.	
ANDI	Gary, do you hear yourself?  Are you listening?

SABRINA	Well girl, you know it's like 10 times more expensive in here.	
DANNI	I got it.	
SABRINA	Are you sure?  Are you sure you didn't bring some with you?  We could just get them on the way home.	
DANNI	I said--I said I got it.  Thanks.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Are you all right?

DANNI	You think I'm a freeloader?	
SABRINA	Hmm?	
DANNI	Answer me.	
SABRINA	I mean, girl, you can be a little heavy-handed when it comes to somebody else's bill.	
DANNI	Okay.	
SABRINA	Danni, is something bothering you?	
DANNI	What time these other getting here?	
SABRINA	They're on the way.  What's wrong with you?	
DANNI	Nothing.	
SABRINA	Okay.  But there's clearly something going on.	
DANNI	So, they talk about me?	
SABRINA	Who?	
DANNI	Karen and Andi.	
SABRINA	No.	
DANNI	You lying.  They talk about me and I know it.	
SABRINA	Danni, what the hell is going on?

DANNI	Well, if you wanna get to know her, you better get to know me.  Come on.

HOSPITAL P.A.	Doctor Sams to radiology, Doctor Sams to radiology.	
KAREN	Girl, where you at?	
ANDI	I am at the hospital.	
KAREN	What?  Why?  What happened?	
ANDI	Oh, no.  It's not for me.  It's a woman who works at my job.  She passed out.	
KAREN	Wow.	
ANDI	Yeah.  They revived her.  But she insisted that I call her son and ride with her to the hospital.  So, are you with the girls?	
KAREN	No, not yet.	
ANDI	Oh.  Well, can you come and pick me up?  I'm at Wilmont.	
KAREN	Yes, of course.  I'm on my way.	
ANDI	Okay.	
KAREN	Are you okay?	
ANDI	Yeah.  I'm fine.  It was just scary.	
KAREN	I'm on my way now, all right?	
ANDI	Okay.  Thanks.	
KAREN	Yeah.  Bye.	
PARIS	Hi.  I'm here to see my grandmother.	
RUBY	Her name?	
PARIS	Irene Johnson.	
RUBY	Irene Johnson.  Right this way.	
PARIS	Oh.  Oh, mommy.	
RUBY	She wants to see you.	
ANDI	Me?	
RUBY	Andi?  Yes.  Right, this way.	
IRENE	There she is.  My hero.	
PARIS	Thank you.	
ANDI	You don't have to thank me.	
IRENE	No, no.  She helped me.	
ANDI	I was just…	
IRENE	Saved my life.	
PARIS	Thank you.  My grandmother is ill and she just refuses to stop working.	
IRENE	No.  If I stop, you may as well bury me.	
PARIS	Don't talk like that.	
IRENE	I'm serious.  Now, listen, that nice young lady needs to get home to no one.  Can you take her home?	
PARIS	Ma…	
IRENE	Well, all right.  Now, go on and take her home, she came in the ambulance with me.  Now, take her home and then come back and get me.  I'll be ready to go home then.	
PARIS	Mom…	
IRENE	Uh-hmm.	
PARIS	Did you fake this?	
IRENE	What?	
PARIS	Doctor, did my grandmother fake this?	
DOCTOR MATHIS	No.  This one was real.  We're going to give her some oxygen.	
ANDI	Miss Irene, I actually have a ride.  So…	
IRENE	Listen, he's gonna take you.  Now, go on.  Go on.  Get out.	
PARIS	Oh.	
ANDI	But my friend is coming.  She's…	
PARIS	It's pointless to argue with my grandmother.	
ANDI	Okay.	
PARIS	Come on.  I'll take you.	
ANDI	All right.  I'll see you soon.	
IRENE	Take your time.	
ANDI	Absolutely.	
IRENE	Take your time.	
ANDI	I'll see you soon, Miss Irene.	
IRENE	You bet that tight little ass of yours you will.	
ANDI	(laughs) Okay.	
PARIS	Hey, I'm so sorry.	
ANDI	It's fine.	
PARIS	She is something else.	
ANDI	Yes.  She is your grandmother, huh?	
PARIS	Yeah.  Well, she tells everyone she's my mom.	
ANDI	Oh.  Well, my girlfriend is actually coming to see me.	
PARIS	How far you got to go?	
ANDI	Downtown.	
PARIS	Let me take you.	
ANDI	I still have to stop by the office to get my bag and…	
PARIS	Come on.  I'll take you, please.	
ANDI	Okay.	
PARIS	Even though my grandma didn't fake it, I assure you, she's milking it.  I'm Paris, by the way.	
ANDI	Andrea, but everyone calls me Andi.	
PARIS	Andi.	
ANDI	Let me call my friend.	
PARIS	I'll run and say goodbye to her while you do that.	
ANDI	Okay.  (laughs)	
KAREN	Hello?	
ANDI	Hey, girl.  I have a ride.	
KAREN	Are you sure?	
ANDI	Yeah.  I'm just gonna run home and shower and then I'll meet you guys later, okay?  Oh, can you take me home?	
KAREN	Okay.	
ANDI	Perfect.	
SINGER	Baby, baby, baby.  You're my (indistinct) to me.  Yeah.	
KAREN	What's up, girl?  (sighs)	
SINGER	So, what, so, what you got?	
SABRINA	Hey.  It's about time.	
KAREN	Andi's at the hospital.	
SABRINA	Is she okay?	
KAREN	Yes.  Somebody at the firm she was helping.  She's on her way.  Where's Danni?	
SABRINA	I don't know.  She over there mad about something.	
KAREN	About what?	
SABRINA	Hell, if I know, girl.	
KAREN	Oh.  Well, I'm sure she'll tell us.  She always does.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.  Oh, by the way.  Who was that woman on the phone?	
KAREN	The wife of the man that I met at the supermarket.	
SABRINA	What guy?  Supermarket?	
KAREN	Look, you don't need to know about it.  All you need to know is that they're both batshit crazy showing up at my job and my house.	
SABRINA	What?	
KAREN	I wish she would.	
SABRINA	That's super scary.  Uh-uh.	
KAREN	I wish she would.	
SABRINA	Wait, why?	
KAREN	They divorced.  Andi did the divorce and she's over here begging me to leave him alone so she could be with him.  I mean it's just--it's crazy, okay?  And another thing, he went off on me for going off on Zac like he's my daddy or something.  I need a drink, please.  Can I?  Waitress.  Hi.  Yes.  Martini, please.  Thank you.  Did she just give me the finger?	
SABRINA	Girl…	
KAREN	She needs to stop smoking that weed.	
SABRINA	I don't know what it is.	
KAREN	Well, whatever.  I'm hungry.	
PARIS	Thank you again.	
ANDI	Thanks for the ride.	
PARIS	I was scared to death.	
ANDI	She seems like a strong woman.	
PARIS	She mentioned you to me.	
ANDI	What?	
PARIS	Yeah.	
ANDI	Oh, that's strange.  I just met her tonight.	
PARIS	Well, she seems to know you.	
ANDI	Oh, yeah.  She told me she knows a lot about me.	
PARIS	From your trash?	
ANDI	(laughs) Yeah.	
PARIS	(laughs) Damn.  I told her not to say that.  It's so weird.	
ANDI	I get what she means now.	
PARIS	She was right though.	
ANDI	What?	
PARIS	You are beautiful.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
PARIS	I mean for a cross-eyed girl.	
ANDI	What?	
PARIS	(laughs) I'm just joking.	
ANDI	Oh, cross-eyed women are beautiful though.	
PARIS	Yes.  I do love political correctness.	
ANDI	They are.	
PARIS	Your eyes are beautiful.	
ANDI	What color are they?	
PARIS	Hazel.	
ANDI	You noticed.  (laughs)	
PARIS	In a certain light, they look green.  Am I right?	
ANDI	Yeah.	
PARIS	And that dress, it brings out the green.	
ANDI	Right again.	
PARIS	Well, what color are my eyes?	
ANDI	(laughs) Brown.	
PARIS	(laughs) Well, that's easy.  I'm black.	
ANDI	Yeah.  But so am I.	
PARIS	Wow.  What a smile.	
ANDI	What?	
PARIS	Look, grandmother, she's, she's always trying to hook me up, but she usually comes with those chicks from church.	
ANDI	Well, you know, I go to church.  And there are a ton of beautiful women in the church.	
PARIS	Yeah.  But the church chicks she brings ain't the beautiful ones.	
ANDI	You have to look at their heart, Paris.	
PARIS	I tried to, but they're all covered in clothes.	
ANDI	Hey, hey.  Don't do that.	
PARIS	I'm just saying they're all covered up.  I think God created a woman to be looked at and admired like you.	
ANDI	So, why do you need your grandmother to set you up?	
PARIS	(sighs) It's a long story.	
ANDI	Well, tell me.	
PARIS	Well, it looks like we're here.	
ANDI	Right.	
PARIS	Oh.  Thank you for taking care of my grandmother.	
ANDI	Of course.	
PARIS	She's all I got.  I feel like I need to…	
ANDI	I need to go.	
PARIS	I need to hug you.  I have to say thank you.	
ANDI	Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.	
PARIS	Come here.	
ANDI	Yes, of course.  It's gonna be okay.	
PARIS	Thank you.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
PARIS	Thank you.	
ANDI	Get--get home safe.	
MAN	Next on Sistas…	
GARY	Does he have your number?	
ANDI	No.	
GARY	Do you have his?	
ANDI	What are you doing?	
GARY	You're a lawyer.  I know I have to ask the right questions.	
ANDI	Well, these questions are pissing me off.	
KAREN	Are y'all talking to Zac?	
DANNI	He's fine with me.  That boy loved you.  But you made him feel like he couldn't do nothing right.  And now you mad at the world.	
KAREN	No.  I'm leaving.	
DANNI	The truth hurts.	
KAREN	Gary left his wife.	
ANDI	I think I told him to leave.	
KAREN	Better be sure that's what you want.	
CALVIN	Oh.  What?
