STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...	

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!	
STORYTELLER	Thomas and Friends! Really Useful around the World!
STORYTELLER	Thomas goes to Mexico City!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was travelling across the United Mexican States.

STORYTELLER	It was a hot and sunny day and Thomas was very happy. He was feeling Really Useful as he pulled a long line of container trucks.
STORYTELLER	At the next station, one of the container trucks was loaded with boxes and boxes...

STORYTELLER	...and boxes and boxes of golden flowers.

STORYTELLER	Thomas wondered what they were for.	And the Station Master told him: “Those are marigolds, Sigñor Thomas! The traditional flowers for Día de Muertos.”

STORYTELLER	“Día de Muertos?” said Thomas.	“What does that mean?”

STORYTELLER	The Station Master explained, “Día	de Muertos means Day of the Dead!”

STORYTELLER	“Day of the Dead?!” said Thomas, “That sounds a bit scary.”

STORYTELLER	“There’s nothing to be scared of,” said the Station Master. “It is a very colourful Festival! Everyone has a good time.”

STORYTELLER	Thomas wasn’t sure about a festival called the Day of the Dead. He thought it sounded a bit spooky.

STORYTELLER	He wanted to be sure to get to	Mexico City before the sun went down...
STORYTELLER	...but he was too late. By the time Thomas reached his final destination...
STORYTELLER	...the sun had set. And it was already dark.
STORYTELLER	And then there was trouble!
STORYTELLER	Suddenly Thomas was surrounded by skeletons!
STORYTELLER	But when Thomas looked a little closer, he could see that the skeletons were just puppets!


STORYTELLER	The Station Master had been right. Thomas had nothing to be scared of.


STORYTELLER	Día de Muertos was in full swing and Thomas’s cargo of marigolds were a colourful addition to the festivities.

STORYTELLER	“Fizzling fireboxes,” said Thomas. “This Day of the Dead Festival has really come alive now!”
