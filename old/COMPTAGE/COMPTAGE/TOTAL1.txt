SCENE 002. GILDA’S HOUSE

GILDA	Eliza! Eliza! Are you sleeping on the job, girl? 

ELIZA	I was dreaming, I woke up to this nightmare. 

GILDA	Oh, you’re complaining, are you? Then its better you wake up, because our life is right here. Oh, Dino asked you to bring drinks for the guys playing pool, ok? 

ELIZA	"Yeah". 

DINO	Where’s the beer? The clientele is waiting. 

ELIZA	You don’t have arms? Get it yourself, lazy bum. 

DINO	What did you say, girl? 

GILDA	Wait, Dino, wait right there, let me see what’s going on. Eliza, don’t speak like that to your father. 

ELIZA	That sleeze is not my father. He spends all the money we make in this forsaken pool bar, then he says he has no money to buy my brothers’ books.
   
GILDA	Your brothers have books and a father that likes them. Eliza, Dino is a good man, he raised you like a daughter, even though he’s not your real father, and all of this belongs to him. If it wasn’t for Dino, I don’t know where we’d be.  

ELIZA	No, if it weren’t for us working for free, this hell hole would’ve closed a long time ago, right? 

GILDA	Stop complaining! Take the garbage outside, go! I’ll take care of my husband’s beer. 


SCENE 003. FRONT OF TIRE REPAIR SHOP-  EXTERNAL

ELIZA	This is no way to live.

VALDECIR	I’m going to clean it, boss, I’ll clean it . 

DINO	Eliza, Eliza. This girl grew up so fast, didn’t she, Valdecir? 

VALDECIR	Oh yeah. 

DINO	Oh yeah, what, man? 

VALDECIR	No, sorry. 
 
GILDA	Dino! The people playing pool are complaining there’s no more tokens. 

YOUNG MAN 1	Oh yeah, hot stuff! Don’t you want a ride? 

ELIZA	Go give your mother a ride, you scumbag, jerk. 

GILDA	What are you doing over there? 

DINO	Helping Valdecir, can’t you see? And I don’t have to answer to you woman, I’m the boss here. 

GILDA	Eliza, Eliza! What are are you doing there again, like a crazy person. Didn’t I tell you I don’t want you standing on this street? What are they gonna think? That you’re offering yourself, right? Want to be taken by one of those trucks?

ELIZA	I do. 

GILDA	(reac)

ELIZA	By my father’s truck. 
		
GILDA	Your father died. How many times do I have to repeat it?

ELIZA	Oh yeah? Then where is he burried then? Show me.  Why don’t you have a picture of him, nothing? 

GILDA	You know the only memory I have of your father is this necklace here, that he gave me before his last trip. 

ELIZA	Hhm. I know he abandoned you and took off in his truck. 

GILDA	I demand respect, I am your mother.

ELIZA	Dad is coming back to get me. 

GILDA	He will never show up, nobody is getting you out of here. Accept it, its less painful that way ! 

ELIZA	I will never accept it. 

GILDA	(reac) Your life is here, girl, with me, with your bothers, with your stepfather. 

ELIZA	I want distance from him. 

DINO	You’re gonna chit chat all day? The kitchen is abandoned ,let’s go.  

GILDA	Forget it, Forget it, Forget it, Eliza, my daughter, forget this street. This isn’s going to get you anywhere, right? Come on, let’s get to work. Let’s work. 

ELIZA	One day I will be leaving.

DORINHA	Oh, that wouldn’t be a bad idea, now would it? 	

ZÉ PEDRO	Woa!

DORINHA	At our house we don’t have a playground, no beach, right? 

ZÉ PEDRO	It’s true. 

DORINHA	No, there’s no jaccuzzi. I would love it, the kids then, tell me about it.  

ZÉ PEDRO	Yeah, me too. 

CAROLINA	The last time you guys were here, you destroyed my apartment that I haven’t even finished paying.

DORINHA	Ah, don’t talk like that, Carolina, you’ll traumatize the kids, your nephews. Look at them, so well behaved. 

CAROLINA	They don’t fool me, they wrecked my British dinnerware last time.

ZÉ PEDRO	But I offered to pay for it. 

CAROLINA	You don’t even have enough money to pay for a saucer!

DORINHA	Really, Carolina, you love to rub it in our face, don’t you? And for what, just because you got rich?

CAROLINA	"Shhhh".

CAROLINA	Enough! 	

DORINHA	know very well what that is for, that is for keeping away bad energy...

CAROLINA	Enough! 	

DORINHA	You keep posing over there like royalty, but you’ve got one foot, look, right in the hood.

CAROLINA	Enough, Dorinha! Or I’ll just forget that you are my only living relative. I don’t have even the slightest issue with my past, I know very well where I came from, and I won’t feel guilty for being a successful person.	

DORINHA	Calm down, alright? No need to get all nervous, your forehead vein is popping there, look, look, you’re going to ruin your procedure.

CAROLINA	I haven’t had any procedures! Listen here, I am late for the airport, I have something very importante to resolve, I am closing the best business deal of my life. When I get back, I want this house exactly how I left it, do you hear me?

DORINHA	Yes ma’ am, don’t you mean kids? 

JOÃO E MARIA	"Uh yeah". 

ZÉ PEDRO	Don’t worry, sister-in-law, we will take care of this house like it is ours.

CAROLINA	That is what I am afraid of. 

JOÃO E MARIA	(yelling – celebration) 

DORINHA	Look, don’t forget to get a little souvenir for me from Australia. (kiss) Have a safe trip.

ZÉ PEDRO	Bye, safe travels. 

JOÃO	We got rid of her. 

DORINHA	My God! 

ZÉ PEDRO	Watch out for the vase, kid. 

DORINHA	Geez.

GERMANO	Are you traveling as well? 

LILI	I am, my love, I am going with you. Why are you so surprised?

GERMANO	Oh, for two years now you’ve refused all my invitations to travel with me, you know? Since the death of our daughter you barely leave the house, Lili.

LILI	This trip is different. 

GERMANO	It’s diferente? But how is it diferente? It is just a business trip, I thought you weren’t interested in the business dealings of Bastille.

LILI	I am interested in everything that I own, Germano, especially regarding my husband.

GERMANO	But... 

LILI	I know very well who you are traveling with. 

GERMANO	(reac)

LILI	Your secretary told me everything. 

GERMANO	Miss Mirtes? 

LILI	I want to see if this Carolina Castilho is going to be brave enough to hit on you with me around.

GERMANO	No, no, no, no, no, Lili, Carolina and I have a strictly professional relationship, you are crazy.

LILI	Of course you do, Mirtes told me so, and I am going to guarantee it stays that way. Shall we?

SCENE 049. INSIDE THE CAR

GERMANO	My angel, I’ve never had anything with Carolina, just like I’ve never had anything with the last secretary you fired and then put miss Mirtes in her place. This one likes to gossip.

JONATAS	Can I help you, sir? Ma’am, you will love this candy, alright? It is tasty and doesn’t stick to your teeth, and best of all, it’s not fattening. Not that the misses needs to worry about that.

LILI	How sweet. But I don’t have any change.

GERMANO	Then let’s just get going. Come on, Silas, let’s go. The light is about to turn green.

LILI	Wait, let me see here.

JONATAS	Don’t worry about it, ma’am, you can pay me some other day.

LILI	Some other day, when? I found a little something here. You deserve it.

JONATAS	Is this a real bill?

GERMANO	Don’t worry about it, are you alright? 

COMANDANTE	Who was it that opened the emergency exit?

CAROLINA	I opened it, actually, the door was already open. How dangerous it would be for us to travel like this. 	

COMANDANTE	But I checked everything. 

CAROLINA	Are you sure? 

GERMANO	I am a witness, this door really was kind of open.

PIETRO	How dangerous, right?

LU	Just absurd. 

GERMANO	Wouldn’t it be best to check everything again, captain? Because I am not taking off until I am certain of the safety aboard this aircraft.

COMANDANTE	Well, that is going to further delay our departure. Excuse me.

CAROLINA	No, our safety is the main priority. We can wait however long it takes, am I right?

PIETRO	Of course. 

CAROLINA	Let’s wait outside. 

PIETRO	Let’s.
