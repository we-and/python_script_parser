RANDY	Oh, not this musical shit again. You and your moms.

ALBEE	Did you take Aaron’s screwdriver, Dad?

RANDY	No, I didn’t touch it. Well, at least there’s some eye candy. You know, the first date I took your moms too was to see “Cats”. (scoffs) She loved that stupid show. I stood in line for two hours to get those tickets, just to watch a bunch of grown ass men prance and sing around in cat costumes. (chuckles) You shoulda seen her smile. She was so beautiful. I'm glad you guys look like her. Well, enough of that. (grunts) Oh. Here. Don’t hurt yourself.

I had this- I had this- this- this, uh, afro and Greg had this jerry curl. It was like every time he danced, jerry curl juice would spill all down the front of him.

FAITH	(overlapping) (laughs) For real?

MILES	Yeah. Oh here wait, this is the encore. Now when he danced this, there was- there was women out there, they’d throw their bras, and their panties and these groupies would come in there and they’d grope him all, he’d be, what?

RANDY	You know the drill, so take your thumb outta your ass and pitch in. I'm gonna close out some deals today and then we’ll go out for some fine dinin’.

AARON	Applebee’s is not fine dining, Dad.

RANDY	Well, aren’t you freakin’ fancy? Huh? (laughs)

ALBEE	(overlapping) And what if you don’t close any deals, huh?

MS. LORETTA	And I see you, Albee. Where’s that damn janitor at? Mary!

PRINCIPAL CARVER	I did some investigating.

MILES	Mm-hmm.

PRINCIPAL CARVER	And it looks like their dad is in county for the next twelve days.

MILES	Yeah.

PRINCIPAL CARVER	I gotta call Child Protective Services.

MILES	(overlapping) Oh, no, no, no, Carver, no. Come on, now, you- you want those boys to spend Christmas in the system?

PRINCIPAL CARVER	(tsk)

MILES	Aw, come on now. No, I’ll take care of them myself if it comes down to that.

PRINCIPAL CARVER	You don’t have to do that, Miles.

MILES	Yeah, I know, I know I don’t. But they seem like such good boys in a little bit of trouble, that’s all. I'm gonna call the station. (clears throat)

PRINCIPAL CARVER	You’re a good man.

MILES	Yeah, yeah, I know.

PRINCIPAL CARVER	(sniffs) Oh.

MILES	Hey, guys, we can’t let you leave on your own, but I spoke to Randy and he said you could stay with me until he’s released, hmm? So this afternoon after the class you’ll come to my apartment and, uh, maybe you can get a home cooked meal and a hot shower. How does that sound?

ALBEE	Kinda creepy. You just invited two students over to your house for a hot shower.

MILES	No, seriously though. You will be staying with me for a bit.

ALBEE	(clears throat) We’ll be fine, but thank you for the offer.

MILES	Oh, no, no, no, there’s no debate. You’re gonna stay with me or Carver’s going to call Social Services, all right? So come on, let’s go.

ALBEE	(scoffs)

MILES	Let’s go, come on. Hey, Aaron?

AARON	Yeah.

MILES	How would you like to take my class? Yeah?

AARON	(whispers) Yeah.

MILES	Ba-bap-bap. (laughs)

PRINCIPAL CARVER	(laughs)

MILES	The password is A-B-C-One-Two-Three.

ALBEE	Seriously?

MILES	Serious, look, I'm seventy years old. What do you expect? I do the best I can, all right. (to class) All right, everybody, listen up! I want you to meet Aaron, he’s gonna be joining us, all right? Assemble up, assemble up. (to Aaron) And Aaron, you pick up what you can. Here we go. Don’t forget that the Best of the Boroughs is comin’ up in two weeks and the prize is forty thousand dollars.

AARON	What’s that?

LEVONDRA	The big dance contest.

MILES	Five, six, seven, eight. Let’s see what you got. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  You’ve got it. Yeah. Come on, Aaron. Bring it on, boy, (unintelligible) in the room. Let’s do it. All right!

GROUP	(cheers)

MILES	Whoo! All right, you all. Now just remember when you go to bed, you keep those shoes on, and don’t you eat too much turkey. You get the itis.

GROUP	(laughs)

MILES	(overlapping) Happy holidays and I love you madly!

GROUP	(cheers)

FAITH	Hey, Gramps.

MILES	Yeah.

FAITH	You ready to go?

MILES	Yeah, well, we should talk.

FAITH	(scoffs) So Mr. B is Faith’s Gramps. Nice.

AARON	You know her?

ALBEE	She is one of my lady friends, yes.

MILES	We got two more.

FAITH	Is that--?

AARON	What is this place?

ALBEE	It’s a frigging karate dojo, what do you think?

MILES	Used to be somethin’ special.

AARON	What happened?

MILES	Time. This isn’t exactly the penthouse. We have two, uh, bedrooms. And, uh, we have this couch over here which is, uh, sofa bed, it pulls out. If you guys don’t mind, you can crash there.

ALBEE	We, uh, we won’t be staying.

MILES	Oh.

AARON	Maybe we should.

ALBEE	I can take care of us.

AARON	I know, but just until Dad gets out.

ALBEE	We don’t need him. We can survive on our own.

AARON	It’s warm here.

FAITH	Gramps?

MILES	Yeah!

FAITH	I borrowed your iPod.

MILES	Just as long as you what?

FAITH	Remember to put it back where you found it.

ALBEE	(coughs) Well, uh, you know, I guess, if, uh, if Aaron wants to, we can stay.

MILES	Oh, good.

ALBEE	We have two rooms. The theater, is off limits, okay? And so is my granddaughter.

AARON	So much for your lady friend.

ALBEE	Shut up.

MILES	Hey, Aaron, do me a favor and take that garbage out.

AARON	Yeah.

MILES	Thank you. (laughs) (to Albee) Albee! It’s ten thirty, get your butt out of bed. 

ALBEE	Mm.

MILES	Hey, remind Faith to take you and Albee down to the thrift store a little later, okay?

MILES	What’s the matter, son?

AARON	What’s this?

MILES	What’s what? Nothin’.

AARON	But it says to open now.

MILES	I already know what’s inside. It’s not the first time I got one of those.

AARON	It’s from the bank.

MILES	Everything’s cool. Got everything under control, all right?

AARON	Okay.

MILES	Okay. Is he still asleep? Albee, wake up! You keep this TV on all night? Huh? Who said that was a good idea? Where’s the remote?

FAITH	What’s with all the shouting?

MILES	The remote?

ALBEE	We fell asleep watching a movie.

MILES	Our guests are raising the electric bill is what the shouting is about.

FAITH	Okay, Gramps, you fall asleep in front of the TV all the time, so calm down before you have a stroke, okay? What, did something else happen?

MILES	No. Hey, uh, Albee, I'm sorry I went overboard. I haven’t had much sleep.

AARON	(laughs…)

GREG	What you doin’ trespassin’ in my theater, white boy?

AARON	I'm staying with Mr. B.

GREG	Miles?

AARON	Yeah.

MILES	I see you’ve met my brother Greg.

AARON	Wait, you’re brothers?

MILES	Mm-hmm. It’s a long story. What are you doin’ here? That door’s not supposed to be unlocked and I told you this theater is off limits and this is my iPod. You took that iPod without asking my permission.

AARON	I'm sorry.

MILES	(overlapping) Look, I bring you into my house, I treat you just like my own and the first chance you get, you burn me. What’s going on?

AARON	Let me explain.

MILES	Speak up! Come on!

AARON	I was practicing for you, okay?

MILES	Practicing what? Come on.

AARON	In your class you talked about a competition, right?

MILES	(overlapping) Mm-hmm.

AARON	With a cash prize. Mm, so (sighs) I thought I could win it, use the money to help you out so the bank doesn’t, you know. (exhales)

MILES	You’re a pretty sharp kid, you know that?

AARON	I'm twelve. I know stuff.

MILES	(laughs) Oh, that’s very nice of you, kid, but unfortunately (sniffs) it’s gonna take more than forty thousand dollars to get me outta this hole. Hey, come with me. I got somethin’ to show you. Go on. What size shoe you wear?

AARON	Seven or eight. You’re a pack rat, huh?

MILES	Oh, no, no, it’s- my brother is. He lives in that old dressin’ room over there.

AARON	He does?

MILES	Yep. (laughs) We used to have an act back in the seventies. This was all of our stuff. (sniffs) Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. Here. Yeah, that’s a good one. Try these on.

AARON	Seriously?

MILES	I don’t want you wearing those raggedy old things all the time. And don’t mistake kindness for weakness. You’re gonna earn those shoes. First thing in the morning, we’re gonna go into training and, uh, get your feet to work. (sniffs)

AARON	So, uh, back in the day…

MILES	Mm-hmm?

AARON	were you and your brother famous?

MILES	We had a few fans.

AARON	Did you guys have a big fight or somethin’?

MILES	What makes you think that?

AARON	Me and Albee fight, but after, we make up.

MILES	What happens if you can’t make up?

AARON	We squash it. We’re family.

FAITH	Gramps? Gramps, you need to come upstairs quick.

MILES	(overlapping) Hmm? Oh. (clears throat)

CASTRO	Well, like I said, I didn’t arrest him because one, the paperwork and, two, I used to puff at that age too, but I never inhaled.

MILES	Yeah-yeah. (laughs) Hey, are you sure you don’t wanna keep these?

CASTRO	It’s all right, I already helped myself.

MILES	Yeah? Let me see. “Devouring children one chimney at a time”?

CASTRO	I love stupid horror movies, but, uh, it’ll probably suck. The next guy who busts him though, might not be so nice.

MILES	Thanks, man.

CASTRO	Take care, Mr. B.

MILES	Take care.

ALBEE	But it’s not that big of a deal.

MILES	Here’s the rule, here’s the rule. (clears throat) You be quiet and I speak, okay? You got very lucky today. Very lucky. I decided to give you a second chance, hmm? Now I know that your father’s away and you respect my family. You have a home with us wherever that might be, all right? Now go, help the kids wash those dishes.

CHRISTIAN	Hey! Hey! Excuse me! Um, do the Bryant Brothers still live here. Hey, listen, come back! I know someone they need to meet!

FAITH	Uncle Greg, one of your crazy fans is lurking outside.

GREG	Who is it?

FAITH	It’s me. (laughs) Your only friend. Thank you.

GREG	Thanks again.

FAITH	You’re welcome. Hey, why are you locking your door all of a sudden?

GREG	In case one of Miles’ transient crackers sneaks back in.

FAITH	Well, they’re not juvenile delinquents. They’re just two kids from school.

GREG	Whatever. Can I eat this now?

FAITH	You can, after you tell me your decision.

GREG	I'm gonna pass.

FAITH	You’re gonna pass on having Christmas dinner with your family?

GREG	Been passin’ for years. Why stop now?

FAITH	Mom was right, you two are worse than small children. How’s it lookin’ in here? You promised to start throwin’ this stuff out, Uncle Greg.

GREG	And you promised to take voice lessons from me.

FAITH	Touché, I guess stubbornness runs in the family.

GREG	(laughs) Night, Faith.

FAITH	Oh, just one more thing.

GREG	Mm.

FAITH	I'm not gonna be bringing Christmas dinner down this year, so unless you wanna go hungry, you’re gonna have to come up for it. (laughs)

MILES	When you first walk into the theater you have to take a deep breath, all right? Let’s do that first. Take a deep breath. Breathe it in. One, two three. (breathes deeply)

AARON	(breathes deeply)

MILES	Now you are home.

GREG	Actually it’s my home. You supposed to stay upstairs.

MILES	Be quiet you old grump. We’ll be outta your hair in a little while.

AARON	Hey, Greg.

MILES	Wherever you are. All right, let’s get this thing started. Get up there on the stage. I’ve noticed three things about you. First thing, you got no rhythm. Second thing, you can’t take choreography. And the third thing is you don’t know how to tap.

AARON	I can tap.

MILES	Let’s see.

AARON	(overlapping) Well, watch this.

MILES	(snores) That’s very, very bad. You gonna listen to me now? Huh? You gonna tap on your right foot. Now it’s just- it’s the brush, spank, step. Let’s see it. Let’s start, brush, lemme see…

AARON	Brush.

MILES	Yep, spank.

AARON	Spank. Brush, spank, step.

MILES	Step, there you go. Now, lemme, loosen this up. Loosen up. Loosen it up. Come on.

AARON	Brush, spank, step.

MILES	(overlapping) Spank. All right, speed that up lemme see that. Brush.

AARON	Brush, spank, step.

MILES	All right, stop, stop. You know that your left foot and your right foot, they gotta go together. Lemme see the right foot and then the left foot and see if you can make them match. Come on, let’s go. Come on. Left. Oh, you’re gonna make me throw up. Gee whiz! Whoo, we got a lot of work to do, boy. Let’s go.

AARON	(breathes deeply)

MILES	We gonna get there, not to worry. What’s this breath- come on.

AARON	You said breathe in the theater.

MILES	Okay, breathe in the theater. Come on, let’s go. You finished breathing? 

AARON	(laughs)

MILES 	(laughs) Come on, let’s go. Brush. Yeah, now the other one. All right, got some hard work to do now. You’re following in the tradition of some great tap dancers, so you can’t be playin’ that cute card. You are going to have to produce.

FAITH	(sings)   They’re ain’t passion and through all of the lows and the highs I'm on your side I'm on your side I'm on your side I'm on your side I'm on your side Na-na, there’s no way out That’s the truth, yeah

ALBEE	Sorry, I didn’t--

FAITH	Have you heard of knocking?

ALBEE	(laughs) I did. Those must be some pretty serious headphones.

FAITH	Yeah. Yeah, they’re pretty good.

ALBEE	Man, you got some pipes.

FAITH	Thanks.

ALBEE	Sing somethin’ else.

FAITH	No. Bye, Albee.

ALBEE	Whoa, hey, hey. Come on. Don’t be like that.

FAITH	I’ll be however I want. Now remove yourself.

MILES	All right. That’s it. We got a long way if we’re gonna make any noise at that competition. But I’ll teach you the rest of the choreography tomorrow and thank you.

GREG	Too bad you’re teachin’ him all wrong.

MILES	What you got to say about it?

GREG	Plenty. (to Aaron) Watch and learn. Kid, the step is not this. No, no, no, no, no. The step is this. (to Miles) It’s called showmanship. This one gonna teach you a lot of bad habits. If I was you, kid, I’d be lookin’ for a new teacher.

AARON	You’re pretty good. Hey, wanna come to the Best of the Boroughs? I'm competing in it.

GREG	Thanks, but, uh, I don’t get out much these days.

AARON	What?

MILES	Haven’t seen my brother dance in a long time.  (breathes) Buh-dup, buh-dup, buh-dup, buh-dup, bup, bup, buh-dup, buh-dup,  let’s go. That’s it, don’t stop. Keep it up, don’t stop, don’t stop. Eat your heart out, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, ha!

ALBEE	Come on, let me treat you.

FAITH	Absolutely not.

ALBEE	You know you want to.

FAITH	(laughs)

MILES	Over the leg and slap the floor. This is Greg’s favorite step, you got to do it.

	[AD-LIBS]

MILES	Yeah. Lookin’ good. Think I'm creatin’ a monster here. (laughs)

AARON	Albee? Hey.

ALBEE	Hmm. What?

AARON	You think Dad’s all right?

ALBEE	I'm sure he’s fine. Go to sleep.

MAN ON PHONE	(on phone) I don’t always have (unintelligible) time. I don’t have it.

LISA	Excuse me. I didn’t mean to startle you, but are you Miles or Greg Bryant?

GREG	Maybe. What’s it to ya?

LISA	Longtime fan.

GREG	(laughs) Well, you must be. We sure don’t have that many new ones. Greg Bryant.

LISA	This is your final notice. You have until January second to bring your account up to date or the sheriff’s gonna remove you from the property.

GREG	That was cold. You didn’t have to pretend.

LISA	It’s not pretend. I grew up in this neighborhood and I remember comin’ to this theater as a kid.

GREG	January second, huh?

LISA	Correct. Well, I hope you guys figure somethin’ out. I’ll be prayin’ for ya.

GREG	Miles.

CAROLERS	(sing Christmas carols…)

ALBEE	So why don’t you sing in public, hm?

FAITH	Who says I don’t sing in public?

ALBEE	Me.

FAITH	Well, you don’t even know me, so your opinion doesn’t matter.

ALBEE	Wow, why are you always so stuck up to me?

FAITH	I'm not stuck up.

ALBEE	Then answer my question.

FAITH	My family are kind of like Broadway legends.

ALBEE	(scoffs) Exactly, so what’s the problem. They probably have like a ton of connections, right?

FAITH	Yeah, except everyone would compare me to them and I just- I just don’t think I can handle those kinds of expectations, you know?

ALBEE	Lame.

FAITH	Excuse you?

ALBEE	It’s a lame excuse. You got a great voice, Faith. Don’t waste it.

FAITH	I'm gonna stop you.

ALBEE	Nope.

FAITH	No.

ALBEE	Nope, come on.

FAITH	I- no, you’re spillin’ my hot chocolate, Albee.

ALBEE	(overlapping) I don’t care.

FAITH	I'm not gonna sing.

ALBEE	Yes, you are. You’re gonna sing, I'm gonna sing, we are gonna Glee this shit up. (to carolers) Hey, is it cool if we sing with you guys?

FAITH	Albee, no.

ALBEE	(overlapping) Cool, thank you. It’s gonna be great. It’s gonna be great. And I'm gonna do it with you, okay? Now come on. Ready? (clears throat) Here we go!

FAITH	That was so bad.

ALBEE & CAROLERS	(overlapping) (sing) Sleep in heavenly (speaks) now wait for it (sing) peace.

ALBEE	You’re gonna crush it tomorrow, little man.

FAITH	Hey, Aaron, you know I'm rootin’ for ya, but I just want you to be realistic about your chances, so don’t be too hard on yourself if you don’t win this thing.

AARON	I'm an underdog, I know, but I got a chance.

ALBEE	(imitates Marlon Brando in “On the Waterfront”) The contender. (normal) Right?

AARON	Hey, guys, come on!

RANDY	Hey!

AARON	Dad!

RANDY	(laughs) How are ya?

ALBEE	Welcome back, jailbird.

RANDY	(laughs) I done my time. Well, look at you, huh? Well, aren’t we fancy? Where you goin’? Applebee’s?

MILES	(laughs)

AARON	No, we’re goin’ to a show.

RANDY	I got the Pacer back, we’re good.

ALBEE	Where’d you get the money?

RANDY	I paid a visit to the blood bank. Sperm bank wouldn’t take me. (chuckles) So you can say thank you to Mr. B, get your things together, we’re outta here.

ALBEE	No, we’re not goin’ with ya, Dad. Aaron’s dancin’ in a competition tonight. That’s the show.

FAITH	Yeah, it’s kind of a big deal and we’re actually running late, so…

AARON	You wanna come?

RANDY	Not to no dance competition.

ALBEE	Fine.

AARON	But Mr. B’s been training me.

RANDY	Yeah, well, your prancin’ days are over, Twinkle Toes. Let’s go, come on.

ALBEE	He’s not going with you.

RANDY	Oh, you’re a big man now?

ALBEE	Bigger than you.

MILES	Hey, Albee, back off. (to Randy) Hey, why don’t you let the kid compete. We’ll talk about the details later, okay?

RANDY	Well, who died and made you king? I said you can watch my kids, not keep ‘em.

MILES	Oh. Man, it’s not like that. You know, he worked real hard. You should see him, man. You should--

RANDY	I don’t wanna see no son of mine dance on no damn stage.

MILES	You can stay here a couple of days. There’s room in the theater, at least until you get on your feet. How about that?

ALBEE	Screw him, Mr. B. He’s a bum. I really wish you would’ve died instead of Mom.

RANDY	You want me to die? (to Miles) You keep ‘em.

MILES	No, no, Randy.

RANDY	I'm outta here!

MILES	Ran- Randy!

RANDY	No!

AARON	No, Dad!

MILES	Randy!

AARON	No, Dad!

ALBEE	Let him go. Let him go.

MILES	Faith, you and Albee go find some place to sit. Me and Aaron, we’re gonna go and check in.

AARON	Kill it, little man.

FAITH	Break a leg.

MILES	Stay strong, let’s go.

CHRISTIAN	(overlapping) Oh my God, look who it is. Mr. Bryant.

BASIL	No.

CHRISTIAN	There’s an open seat right here. Would you do us the honor? Thanks. My name is Christian. I'm a huge musical theater fan.

BASIL	Could you tell? I'm Basil and you’ll have to forgive my partner here, he’s really drunk.

CHRISTIAN	(laughs) Anyway, you know, it’s kind of funny that I’d run into you here because just a few days ago I was outside of the Bryant Theater looking for you and Miles. I think I might’ve scared your daughter. She’s your daughter right. I mean, I was late and it was dark, but I didn’t--

BASIL	Could you leave the nice man alone, please?

CHRISTIAN	Does the name Frank Goodman ring a bell?

GREG	Course. How do you know him?

CHRISTIAN	This is his son.

GREG	Really? Your daddy was the best manager we ever had, like family.

SOPHIE	Representing the Stages Performing Arts School is Travis Diaz.

ALBEE	These guys are good.

FAITH	Yeah.

MILES	Looks good. Somethin’s missin’. You know what that is? Huh? Look. It’s dance.

AARON	How is dance missing?

MILES	Dance is a homeless kid who looked up to a- a street drummer so he could make some change and prove himself. It’s family. It’s a kid dancin’ the truth. And what do you feel right here and right now? Use it, huh? Dance it. Hey, tell your story. (clicks) Get ‘em.

SOPHIE	(overlapping) From the Brooklyn High School of the Performing Arts please welcome Aaron Davis.

MILES	Easy now. Pretty sharp kid, huh?

RANDY	Your mother was so beautiful. You shoulda seen her smile.

ALBEE	Crush it tonight, little man.

MILES	This is gonna hurt me more than it hurts you, but if we’re gonna do it, we’re gonna do it right.

AARON	You think I can take dance next year?

RANDY	(laughs)

MILES	Tell your story.

RANDY	I don’t wanna see no son of mine dance on no damn stage.

MILES	It’s gonna take more than forty thousand dollars to get me outta this hole.

RANDY	What, do you think you’re good? Well, you’re not!

AARON	Dad!

ALBEE	Then quit jerking off, get in here and …

RANDY	You want me to die? Done. Done. Done. (echoes)

AARON	(pants) (grunts) Ah! Ah!

SOPHIE	Well, um, next up is Blue Crew.
	
MILES	What happened out there?

AARON	Nothin’.

MILES	Oh. Didn’t look like nothin’ to me. Why’d you run away like that, son? Huh?

AARON	Because I don’t wanna do this anymore. I hope you lose your small tiny shitty crappy theater. I’d rather sleep in my dad’s car than listen to one more of your lectures. Son?

LEVONDRA	They’re announcing the winners.

SOPHIE	Before I announce the winner, I’d like to congratulate all of our dancers. The winner of this year’s Best of the Boroughs is Travis Diaz.

TRAVIS DIAZ	Yeah!

DANCER #1	Yo, you go, T!

ALBEE	(grunts)
	
DANCER #2	(gasps)

MAN #1	Hey!

ALBEE	Hey!

MILES	Aaron? Aaron!

BASIL	That’s it, I'm outta here.

CHRISTIAN	Yeah, call the car.

BASIL	Come on, let’s go.

MILES	Oh, this isn’t working. Let’s get the hell outta here.

MAN #2	Come on, we gotta go home right now. Come on, baby.

SOPHIE	Everyone, please stay seated. The situation is under control.

WOMAN #2	Wait for me! Wait for me!

ALBEE	Hey! Ah! Slow down, man, come on. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! What are you doing, huh? Where are you goin’? I'm glad you didn’t want to go back to Mr. B’s.

AARON	(scoffs) I can’t. Not yet.

ALBEE	I know the feeling. Faith’s gonna tear me a new one.  (sighs) Look at this.

AARON	He never forgets.

ALBEE	Yeah, he’ll surprise you now and then (cries) 

AARON	I'm ready. 

ALBEE	Me too. (kisses)

AARON	Bye, Mom. (cries)

ALBEE	So what was that all about back there, huh?

AARON	Well, I'm not supposed to tell you, but Mr. B. really needed that money.

ALBEE	What?

AARON	Yeah, so apparently--

FAITH	You spent all of our money, but you didn’t have the balls to tell me?

MILES	Faith, you just watch your language. Don’t be coarse.

FAITH	Oh, I'm sorry, you- you don’t get to lecture me. Not tonight. No, you- you forfeited that privilege.

MILES	Baby girl, please come on out here and let’s talk. Greg had no right to interfere.

FAITH	Oh, now- now you wanna talk?

MILES	Yeah.

FAITH	Okay, well then let’s start with you explaining why you lied to me for however long. When were you gonna break the news, Gramps? When the sheriff showed up to evict us? You were the one who always said we should never lie. Never keep secrets. I guess that didn’t apply to you. So what I wanna know is what are we going to do?

MILES	We’ve got a lot to figure out.

FAITH	Yeah.

MILES	Yeah.

FAITH	Yeah, we do. That’s- that’s an understatement. We don’t have anywhere to live. We have to find a new apartment. We have to find people to help us move.

MILES	Shh, calm- calm down. Okay. Okay, so let me get this straight. You blew all of my college money, you’ve been lying to my face and you want me to calm down? Gramps, we’re gonna be homeless in a week! (cries) I- I can’t believe you call yourself a role model. I really can’t. (sniffs) You, uh, ever get the feeling that your whole world is collapsing and that you’re the architect?

FAITH	You should’ve told me, Gramps.

MILES	Tell you what? We’re gonna lose the house? What kind of thing is that to tell your granddaughter? I took those boys off the street, and now I gotta put ‘em right back in the street and we’re gonna go along with them. It’s hopeless.

FAITH	Gramps. Gramps.

MILES	(cries) Ah.

FAITH	There’s always hope. I- I know things seem bleak, but the storm will pass, right? And the only way to start the next chapter is to turn the page. You taught me that.

MILES	I taught you that? You sure?

FAITH	Yeah.

MILES	(snorts)

FAITH AND MILES	(laugh)

MILES	Okay. (kisses) ‘Kay.

FAITH	(to Aaron) Gramps wants to see you in the theater. (to Albee) Just couldn’t help yourself, could you? You had to assault that poor guy.

ALBEE	He was a douche. Aaron deserved to win.

FAITH	No, he didn’t.

ALBEE	What?

FAITH	It’s the truth. And, uh, what are you gonna do if they press charges?

ALBEE	Take it like a man.

FAITH	Look, can you just be serious for like a minute?

ALBEE	God, what crawled up in your ass and died?

FAITH	I'm sorry, I thought you actually wanted to change.

ALBEE	I do, but in case you forgot, our dad ditched us yesterday.

FAITH	And you think you’re the only one who’s had it rough? God, Albee, how blind can you be?

ALBEE	I don’t know, but I'm sure you’re gonna tell me.

FAITH	How about this? The bank’s foreclosing on the theater and kicking us out in the beginning of January and we have no idea what we’re gonna do.

ALBEE	Buy an RV and take the show on the road?

FAITH	Would you stop? This isn’t a joke, Albee? You know what? You need to grow up and stop running around like some little freeloading punk who thinks he’s some sort of Casanova ‘cause you’re not. (laughs)

ALBEE	(scoffs) Wow.

FAITH	Albee, I didn’t mean that.

AARON	Sorry about all that bad stuff I said.

MILES	Yeah, well, that stunt you pulled last night, it was not okay.

AARON	But Albee punched someone.

MILES	That ain’t got nothin’ to do with what you did. You let your emotions overcome you. Well, last night you lost control of your story. Hey, look at me. You’re gonna get there, you know that, don’t you? Hey! Hey! You are goin’ to get there. Okay, now, let’s get up here. Come on. Come on.

MILES	This is yours. You act up like that again, I'm gonna have you clean up this whole damn neighborhood. Take it.

AARON	What’s the point?

MILES	The point is this is our home. Take the mop. You get to work.

GREG	What are you doin’ here?

AARON	Just lookin’. So this is it.

GREG	This is what?

AARON	Where you live.

GREG	Don’t touch it.

AARON	You did movies too. I thought you didn’t get out much?

GREG	Used to get out a lot, back in the day. Had quite a reputation.

AARON	I hope I can dance like you one day.

GREG	Well, you keep workin’ hard, maybe you’ll get there. If your brother don’t screw you up first.

AARON	What do you mean?

GREG	Nothin’, never mind. Story time’s over, kid.

FAITH	Here, look at this. You know, Miles was a Renaissance man, directing, choreographing, he did it all. Um, Greg’s the one they came to see. He was the headliner.

AARON	It was a car accident, right?

FAITH	Yeah, Gramps fell asleep at the wheel. I mean, he came out of it all right, but, um, Uncle Greg, he, uh, he hurt his back pretty bad. Never went on stage again.

AARON	Where have you been?

ALBEE	Thinkin’.

AARON	Well, while you’ve been jerkin’ off, I cleaned up the whole theater.

ALBEE	Well, actually that’s exactly what I was thinkin’ about.

AARON	Yeah, I bet.

ALBEE	I'm talkin’ about the theater, smart ass! We gotta figure this thing out.

FAITH	You know, what, Albee, can you just help us pack?

ALBEE	No, listen, my boy Corey’s raising money for his sister on Indiegogo. You can make, like, a ton of money there.

FAITH	Okay, but don’t we need some kind of incentive to encourage people to donate money?

ALBEE	Yeah.

AARON	I know what we could do.

GREG	Huh. So that’s what they’re callin’ music these days?

ALBEE	What, you don’t like hip-hop?

GREG	No, I don’t. I like soul. But you wouldn’t know nothin’ about that.

FAITH	Hip-hop has soul.

ALBEE	Yeah, Run DMC, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube.

MILES	Greg? Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, Greg, come back here. Greg! Got somethin’ to show ya. Come on, look at this. Come on, look. You know what this is here? These kids here are using our name to help raise money so we can stay here. And so far they’ve raised over two thousand dollars.

AARON	People love this theater and they want to see you guys back on stage again.

FAITH	I think it’s worth a try. It could be our last shot.

GREG	Ya’ll can do this Internet deal, but we ain’t performin’ again. No, don’t nobody wanna see that mess.

FAITH	I do.

GREG	Well, let Aaron do it.

ALBEE	Nobody really wants to see Aaron.

AARON	I'm just a kid. You’re legends.

FAITH	I mean, look at this. The Bryant brothers have been in hibernation for too long and I can’t wait to see them perform again.

ALBEE	Look how many likes you got.

GREG	Likes, hmm? Well, I don’t care nothin’ about no likes.

FAITH	Do you care about me?

GREG	Of course I care about you. But maybe all this is for the best.

FAITH	So I guess we won’t be seeing you for Christmas dinner then. (to Miles) You just gonna let him go?

MILES	It was a good idea, but maybe we should start thinkin’ about, uh, packin’ up and gettin’ outta here.

FAITH	Um, I know we said we weren’t doing presents this year, but I couldn’t help myself. Merry Christmas.

AARON	Thanks.

FAITH	Merry Christmas, Gramps. Like it?

AARON	Yeah, I love it.

ALBEE	Are you sure you didn’t get our gifts mixed up?

FAITH	Open yours, Gramps.

MILES	What? Where did you find this?

FAITH	Albee helped me.

ALBEE	I have my sources.

MILES	Wow!

AARON	Can we play it?

MILES	Yeah, I got a turntable in my bedroom. Let’s do this.

GREG	This is your wake up call. Look, I know it’s Christmas morning, but we gonna do this show, we better get to work.

MILES	Yeah! All right! Yeah, you ready? Come on. Let’s get up there. Bap, bap.

GREG	Mm-hmm. 

MILES	You may have to adapt, Greg.

GREG	This is- this is--  I can’t- I can’t go out like this, Miles. I can’t do it. I can’t embarrass myself.

MILES	I need to talk to you, man. Come on, man, this is years ago. You don’t have to do the big thing all the time. Take it easy.

GREG	Damn it, give- just give ‘em to me! Just give ‘em to me! Just give ‘em to me!

FAITH	(overlapping) No, Uncle Greg, we need it!

MILES	Lemme see you sweep the floor.  You remember the little sweep? Yeah.

GREG	Everybody! Yeah.

ALBEE	Big show, Bryant Theater!

MILES	Yeah!

GREG
	Everybody!
MILES	Uh-huh! Check, check. Check, one, two.

GREG	I know you got the form, but I'm gonna teach you the step. Bah, right?

FAITH	All right?

GREG	No, no, no, no, no, not my hat, not my hat.

FAITH	No, this is- this is, no!

GREG	No, Faith, please! Give me a, “Hello, ladies.” (laughs)

AARON	(laughs)

GREG	Hello, ladies. I'm done, ya’ll.

FAITH	(sings scales)

GREG
	Bryant Brothers
MILES	Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen!

GREG	I don’t know how I'm gonna get through this show, though. I'm tired.

MILES	Me too.

GREG	(laughs)

MILES	Let’s go sit down somewhere.

GREG	Whoa!

ALBEE	Hey!

MILES	All right. Looks like we’re gettin’ ready to do this again.

GREG	Doin’ it again.

FAITH	Oh really. (laughs)

MILES	Ah-ah-ah! Knock it off. Break it up.

FAITH	Gramps, look at this.

MILES	What?

FAITH	We raised twenty-five thousand dollars in a week and that is not including ticket sales.

MILES	(overlapping) Ooh.

ALBEE	Which should add up to another ten grand.

MILES	That means we have another sixty K to--

PRINCIPAL CARVER	We may have a situation here.

MILES	What?

PRINCIPAL CARVER	Yeah.

MILES	You guys hang tough. Be right back.

ALBEE	Okay.

SOPHIE	Oh.

CHRISTIAN	Here, let’s go sit over here.

SOPHIE	Okay.

BASIL	This one here.

CHRISTIAN	This is so exciting. I mean, the Bryant Brothers.

BASIL	(unintelligible) well, the last time I saw you two this excited, Kristin Chenoweth was selling a crock pot on QVC.

MILES	Hey, man, open up. Crowd’s gettin’ restless.

PRINCIPAL CARVER	We need to make an announcement.

MILES	Oh, just give me a minute. Just a minute. (to Greg) Hey, Greg? Greggy! You try. He listens to you.

FAITH	Uncle Greg, you know, you really should see this crowd. They are excited to see you.

GREG	Leave me alone!

AARON	What’s wrong?

GREG	What’s the point? Huh? The guy they came to see is gone and he ain’t comin’ back.

AARON	Back me up, okay? Come on.

MILES	Hey. Gimme a minute.  Hey, Greggy? Why don’t you come on out here?

GREG	Aah.

MILES	You remember when we first bought this theater back in, uh, in seventy-nine? People thought we was crazy tryin’ to open up a community theater in Bed Stuy. Yeah, we proved ‘em wrong, didn’t we, man.

GREG	Ah, stop with the memory lane shit. It don’t have a happy ending.

MILES	Oh, no, no, no, it can have a happy ending, man, it can if you come out of that- that cave you got in there. The kids are up there waitin’ on us. We’re a family, man. You can do this.

GREG	I can’t.

MILES	Yes, you can.

GREG	I can’t do it! I ain’t got no feet! I'm an embarrassment to my name! And it’s because of you! You did this! You did this to me!

MILES	Yeah, hey, Greg, um, (sniffs) I'm sick and tired of being sorry. I’ve spent the last thirty years apologizing to you. I fell asleep at the wheel, man. I'm sorry. I hurt myself too, man. (cries) I can’t dance either. Not gonna spend the rest of my life in a cave, man. I got a job as a- as a school teacher. I'm tryin’ to take care of you, man. (Inaudible) your granddaughter to come and feed you those freaking meals every day when you hide in your dungeon. It is not my fault that you gave up on life, that you chose to hang out with those groupies. It’s not my fault that you can’t get up, huh?

GREG	What’d you say?

MILES	I said you can’t get up anymore.

GREG	You wanna go, huh? You wanna-- Gimme this damn cane.

MILES	(overlapping) Yeah. What? What you gonna—What you gonna—They’re gonna put you in a home.

GREG	When I'm finished with you, they’re gonna put you in a home. You understand what I'm sayin’?! They gonna put you in a frickin’ home!

FAITH	(overlapping) Greg, stop it! Stop it! What are you doing?

MILES	Gimme this cane. You kiss my ass.

GREG	You kiss my ass.

MILES	Yeah.

FAITH	Stop.

MILES	I'm outta here, you shit. I don’t need you anymore.

PRINCIPAL CARVER	People will understand.

MILES	Come on, let’s go.

RANDY	Anybody here? All right, thanks. (sighs)

AARON	Um, hey, uh, uh, thanks for comin’, everybody. N- now I'm sure a lot of you are wondering what this little white boy’s doin’ on stage (chuckles). Well, my name’s Aaron Davis and Mr. B and Uncle Greg, they saved my life and my brother’s too. Now I'm gonna dance for you guys and donate some money, okay? (clears throat) Albee, hit it.

ATTENDEE	This ain’t no Bryant Brothers, I want my money back.

RANDY	Hey, pal, it’s for charity.

CHRISTIAN	Thank you.

RANDY	Sure, that’s my son.

MILES	Uh, too much!

GREG	And I don’t do Queens. Congratulations, kid

AARON	Um…

GREG	My old move, you finally pulled it off.

RANDY	Hell of a show, guys. Hell of a show. I brought some people with me, I hope you don’t mind. They’re- they’re friends of Greg’s.

CHRISTIAN	Greg, congratulations, great show.

RANDY	Well, is this a funeral or an after party?

AARON	We didn’t raise the money.

RANDY	Oh, I don’t know about that.

BASIL	You guys were fabulous. My dad would turn in his grave if I didn’t do something to help you out.

AARON	Who was your dad?

GREG	The man who launched, uh, our career.

BASIL	This is for you. It’s enough to save the theater and reopen it to the community.

FAITH	Are you kidding?

AARON	For real?

CHRISTIAN	Well, there’s two conditions.

GREG	Uh, here we go.

CHRISTIAN	Hang on a minute, everybody.

BASIL	One, you have to tell me about my dad. He was always on the road with you and I never got to know him.

GREG	And…

CHRISTIAN	Two, you gotta let us help you with the books. What do you think?

AARON	We say yes.

MILES	What he said.

GROUP	(laughs)
