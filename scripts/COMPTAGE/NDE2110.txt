REPORTER V.O.		Rioters have filled in the streets…

REPORTER 2 VO		PEOPLE …it’s the fourth wave of riots…

REPORTER VO		This evening, martial law has been declared throughout the country.

REPORTER VO		No one shall be allowed to enter the streets…	

REPORTER VO		The assembly of governors have declared war  [jet engine roar] is imminent.

WARRIOR 1		Pu-jo!

FUMITAKA		Scouts from the Uroku Kingdom mapping our land. Then their preparation has begun. Gather all the clans. It is time.

FUMITAKA VO		Cage of the Lost Clan, the Ninja Council requests your presence for a peace summit at the Warlord’s Temple in the Great Eastern Mountains. Choose four of your finest to accompany you. They should have honor and live by the Code. For it will be they who help usher in a new era of peace among our kind. A new age that will provide safety and security for our families. So bring your strongest, your smartest, your fiercest, and your most talented. May your journey be swift,  [engine stalls]

CAGE		There we go.

FUMITAKA VO		And may wisdom be your guide.

CAGE		Remember, this is a peace summit. Leave your weapons behind.

TRILLION		The education system of our ancestors was they actually had to go into a room and read stuff. Yeah. Nothing was downloadable back then. They had to go and memorize things…

MAR		Is that Becker?

TRILLION		This doesn’t look good.

BECKER		Keep them close and stay by me.

FIRE CLAN MEMBER	What about our weapons?

MAR		It’s a peace summit, guys.

BECKER		Fumitaka must be hard up if he’s invited the… Lost Clan. Tell me, is it that you’ve lost your way or lost your honor?
		
CAGE		This is a peace summit.

BECKER		The Lost Honor Clan makes much more sense to me now Hey. It’s the big deaf and dumb guy. How is life with the honorless? Feel more at home there? Answer me, you big freak!

CAGE		Honor the Code!

SURGE		Your code!

BECKER		What they say about you is only partly right. I know the truth. You are a liar and a coward.

HIROSHI		No fighting! We’re here for a peace summit. You must put your petty differences aside. Master Fumitaka has ordered it. Now! Cage of the Lost Clan. How have you 
 		been?

CAGE		Surviving.

HIROSHI		Surviving? Come on. It’s time to flourish. Master Fumitaka will be very pleased to see you. It’s been way too long, brother. No weapons in the bunker! Relinquish them! Now!
			
SURGE		Who’s Captain Uptight over there?

CAGE		Hiroshi. We trained together under Master Fumitaka. He was chosen as Master’s second.

SURGE		Over you? I guess you can’t be given everything, can you, little brother?

SURGE		How far down does this thing go?

TRILLION		These old bunkers sometimes went a hundred floors down. Thousands of feet into the earth.  People lived down here after the Great War. Protected them from the fallout.

SURGE		Only the twentieth floor? I usually like my peace summits at least fifty floors down.

NINJA GUARD LEADER 	No one has ever come back from the lower floors alive.

SURGE		Ooooooh.

NINJA GUARD LEADER	Follow me.

HIROSHI		Clan leaders, I am honored to present to you our revered master, Fumitaka!

FUMITAKA		Brothers! Sisters! Fellow ninja warriors! Look at us. Leaders of the great clans standing side by side. Each powerful in his own right. Each unique with his own gifts. The Southern Clan with their fire-throwers. The haunting Specters of the Eastern Sea. Mighty Desert Dragons with an even mightier bite. [growl, hiss] The Sirens with their deadly yet irresistible allure. Even the mysterious Lost Clan has come from afar. Brothers and sisters, I come to you with grave news that threatens our very way of life. We must come together as one clan today.

FUMITAKA		Silence! I declare a year of truce. No clan may harm another clan. No ninja may harm another ninja. Violation of this truce will be punishable by death. He was caught scouting our woods. The Uroku Kingdom is building an army. They will attack soon. One by one, we would have fallen. But, my brothers and sisters, together as one clan, we are unbeatable. We are bound by the Code. Code of the Clan. Who will stand with me?

CAGE		Fumitaka… Fumitaka…

FUMITAKA		On this day… let the peace begin now!

CAGE		Fumitaka… Fumitaka…

CAGE		Master? Master!
NINJA GUARD LEADER	It was that one. From the Lost Clan.

RAFTER		It was him. I saw him throw it.

HORACE		I saw it with my own eyes. The one called Cage.

SURGE		Get us the hell out of here.

BECKER		Grab them!

CAGE		Let’s get out of here! Let’s go!

SURGE		Looks like we’re a few weapons short.

MAR		Cage!

CAGE		Grab their weapons! Let’s keep moving!

SURGE		My kind of peace summit.

BECKER		Master Hiroshi, you cannot ignore three witnesses. Cage must pay for this.

HIROSHI		Bring me Cage… Alive. The clan that captures him will be rewarded. Bring these men their weapons!

SURGE		What was that?!

CAGE		I don’t know. I didn’t see it.

TRILLION		There’s something out there!

CAGE		Get in the light!

TRILLION		I’m going to learn that from you one day.

TRILLION		Surge, Surge, Surge, Surge, Surge!

TRILLION		! It’s an illusion.

CAGE		Surge, we’re still 200 feet underground.

SURGE		Any bright ideas now, little brother?

CAGE		Power count.

TRILLION		I spent all mine getting us off the summit floor.

CAGE		Mar?

MAR		Full.

CAGE		Surge?

SURGE		Thirsty.

CAGE		Surge!

SURGE		Full! Barely time to make a blue spark. Did anyone get a look at the assassin?

MAR		No. It all happened so fast.

CAGE		It’s got to be Becker.

TRILLION		Becker? How could it be Becker? You look nothing alike.

CAGE		The look on Becker’s face right after. Like he knew it was going to happen.

MAR		Well who would want Fumitaka dead anyways?

CAGE		It’s Becker. He doesn’t want peace. He wants us gone. He kills Fumitaka and then blames me. Gives him the excuse  to finally take our entire village out while putting him in tight with the new regime. Two birds, one stone.

SURGE		If you turned yourself in, they’d let the rest of us go.

TRILLION		I doubt that.

SURGE		Well it’s worth a shot, isn’t it?! We’re just waiting to die down here!

CAGE		Your loyalty’s appreciated.

SURGE		Hey, you got us into this mess, coming to this ridiculous summit!

TRILLION		Surge, you’re acting like an idiot!

SURGE		Oh, I’m an idiot, huh?! I’m an idiot?! Look where it’s gotten us to, huh?!

CAGE		Surge!

SURGE		How’s he going to hold this clan together?! Well at least I’ll be drunk when we die.

CAGE		We’ll stay alive by the Code!

SURGE		Your Code is dead and so are we!

CAGE		Our Code is a commitment.  To the clan. The village. Each other! This isn’t about us! About whether we live! It’s about whether our wives live! Our children live! Our clan lives! The Code is bigger than me! Bigger than us!  Brother, we must be bigger than us.

CAGE		Come on. Let’s get out of here.

SURGE		Let’s split up.

TRILLION		I don’t think that’s a good idea.

MAR		We’ll never find each other.
SURGE		We’ve got to cover more ground.

CAGE		Alright, let’s split up. But remember this spot. Get back here in fifteen.

MAR		Two on one? I guess the odds are even.

CAGE		Find anything?

SURGE		Six guarding a staircase. Must lead somewhere they don’t want us to go.

CAGE		Picked up some presents for you. Where’s Mar?

CAGE		Mar!

SURGE		Noooo! No-no-no-no-no!

CAGE		Mar, guardian of clan and family. Your heart beat with bravery. Your blood flowed with sacrifice. Your death defined honor. Peace, my friend. Peace and honor in the worlds to come.

CAGE		Grab whatever you can. We’re leaving in ten. Hey, Trillion. Trillion.

CAGE		You’re going to make it. We’re all going to make it.

TRILLION		Your brother. Can you trust him with Sky? They’re awfully close.

CAGE		Been close ever since Sky came to us. Oh, sky wasn’t born to us. He was from Becker’s clan. When they discovered he couldn’t hear or speak, they cast him out. Sky wandered all the way over to the far territory to us, back when my father was still master of our clan. Dad took him in, placed him with a family that could raise him, and he’s been loyal to me and my brother ever since. He won’t fight against us.

RAFTER		They’ve killed two of my men, one of the Dragons, and at least five of your guards.

HIROSHI		Where are they now?

NINJA GUARD LEADER	They were last seen near the elevator.

HIROSHI		Which elevator?

NINJA GUARD LEADER	The elevator.

SURGE		Move!

CAGE		Surge--

SURGE		That-a-way!

CAGE		Get back!

BECKER		Cage! Give it up and I’ll let your men go free!

CAGE		That is not an option!

SURGE		We’re not getting through this way! We’re going to have to go back.

CAGE		They’re not advancing. They’re trying to block us. There must be an exit behind that door. 

SURGE		From behind!

CAGE		Do your men know that you killed Fumitaka?

BECKER		Three witnesses saw you do it.

CAGE		Why would I kill him, huh?!

HIROSHI		Your bitter, Cage. He chose Hiroshi over you.

CAGE		Your men doubt you, Becker! They know your behind this! I wouldn’t close my eyes tonight. If your men are smart, they’ll take care of you themselves!
			
BECKER		Cage! Where are your men now?

CAGE		You want to see the Lost Clan?! I’ll show you the Lost Clan!

CAGE		Fall in!

BECKER		Get them!

CAGE		Hey, here it is!

SURGE		Come on!

BECKER		Cage!

CAGE		Check the bags for weapons.

TRILLION		I got some throwing knives…and black powder.

CAGE		For making fireballs. Highly explosive.
	
SURGE		No throwing stars.

TRILLION		They’re fire-throwers. Do your homework.

SURGE		I don’t think I like your tone.

TRILLION		What’s that?

CAGE		Whoa!

TRILLION		No! No-no-no-no-no! God, this isn’t good.
		
SURGE		How do you call the elevator?

TRILLION		You don’t.
SURGE		What the hell is that supposed to mean?

TRILLION		It’s a decoy. It only goes down. Whoever built this place put them in so  anyone trying to escape would end up way the hell down here.

CAGET			here must be another way out of here.

SURGE		Another way out? It’s all your fault!

CAGE		Back off!

SURGE		I should’ve turned you in when I had the chance.

CAGE		I should’ve left you at home.

TRILLION		Let him go, Surge! No…

SURGE		I am the older son. Father should’ve never put you in charge. You should be taking orders from me!

CAGE		You’d be dead without me!

TRILLION		No, you’re wasting it! None of us are going to have power until tomorrow! You’re killing each other! You’re killing us!

CAGE		Power count.

CAGE		Power count!

TRILLION		Nothing.

CAGE		I’m spent.

TRILLION		How about you, Surge? You saved some for us, right?! You thought of the clan, right?!

SURGE		Yeah, I got something left!

TRILLION		You wasted it.

CAGE		We will stick together! There’s no other way out but together.

SURGE		Let’s go.

HIROSHI (ON TV)		Cage, I hope you’re hearing this. I have evidence proving your innocence. But I have to prove it to the other clans. They want blood, and I can’t  hold them off for too  long. You’ve got to make it back here. There are two exit elevators located… Cage, I hope you’re hearing this. I have evidence  [Hiroshi message continues to  repeat]

TRILLION		No-no-no-no! What elevators?! That’s just great… You broke it!
	
CAGE		Hey! Hey. Hey. Let’s just keep moving.

SURGE		Holy hell!
TRILLION		What’s that smell? It’s been so many years. The air must have preserved the flesh. It’s almost like-- Get it off me! Get it off me! You got to get me out of here, man!

CAGE		Hey! We stay together. We’ll find a way out. Okay? It’s okay. You okay? Just relax.

SURGE		What the hell?

CAGE		Let’s get out of here.

CAGE		Secure the door!

TRILLION		No! No-no-no-no-no--

CAGE		Ssssh! Shut up!

SURGE		Why are we stopping?!

CAGE		Okay, okay. It’s okay. Alright, let’s have a look.

CAGE		Anybody got some water? We need to wrap that. Give me your belt. Here we go. You’re going to make it. We’re all going to make it. 

SURGE		I don’t know about you guys, but zombie killing makes me hungry.

CAGE		Come on. Let’s get the hell back home.

CAGE		Here it is!
	
SURGE		Start it up!

CAGE		Come on!

SURGE		Start!

CAGE		It’s not working!

SURGE		Trillion!

CAGE		Come on! Get on it!
	
TRILLION		I don’t know this system, you guys. I can’t do this.

CAGE		Trillion!  Come on!

TRILLION		I got it!  Come on, let’s go!
	
CAGE		Here we go! Let’s go!

TRILLION		Get back in here!

SURGE		Let’s go!

TRILLION		There’s too many! The gate won’t close
CAGE		Sky! Come on! Sky! Sky! Sky!!! No! No!!!

TRILLION		Cage, it’s too late.
			
CAGE		No! Sky!

TRILLION		We can’t save him. It’s over.

CAGE		No!!! Sky!!! No! No!!! No, Sky! Sky, no!!!
	
SIREN 1		I’m unarmed. You can check for yourself if you’d like. You want to know who killed Fumitaka, don’t you?

CAGE		Tell me.

SIREN 1		You look like you could use some rest… and attention.
	
SURGE		You have no idea. No weapons.

SIREN 1		This was the Warlord’s private apartment. Fully stocked by Fumitaka. It has everything you could ever want. Food. Wine. Medical supplies. Private exits. Private bedrooms.

CAGE		It was Becker, wasn’t it?

SIREN 1		Is that what you want me to say? Do you not remember?

CAGE		Remember what?

SIREN 1		The answers… are all… right…in there…

CAGE		It can’t be.

SIREN 1		You’re just tired. You need to drink.
		
CAGE		What have you done?

SIREN 1		Just relax.

CAGE		Find the exit.

SIREN 3		Come on.

SIREN 1		Leaving without saying goodbye? Now that’s just rude.

SIREN 1		No need to rush home. Everyone in your village will be dead before you get there. All the clans have been sent. Bye bye, Lost Clan.

SURGE		We made it.

CAGE		Surge! Surge, Surge, you’re going to make  it. You’re going to be alright. Hold on! Please, please, please, please, brother! Stay with me! Just hold on! Please! Surge! Stay with me. Hey. Stay with me. Stay with me… Please… Please, brother. Stay with me. I need your help.


CAGE		I need you brother. I can’t do this alone.

SURGE		Father chose the right son. Cage shushes Surge.

CAGE		This will slow down the poison. Now rest… Rest.

BECKER		Impressive. You put up quite a fight. I didn’t think you had it in you.

CAGE		The assassination, I know you didn’t do it.

BECKER		What a revelation. Are you finally admitting your guilt?

BECKER		Three witnesses saw you!

CAGE		They saw an illusion!
	
BECKER		Do it, you coward! Kill me.

CAGE		Who is headed to my village?!

BECKER		What village?

CAGE		Who killed Fumitaka?!

BECKER		You did! Didn’t you?

CAGE		Brother. Hey.

SURGE		Where are we?

CAGE		Home, Surge. Home. The poison is moving again. We need to get you back to the  village now.

SURGE		Water.

CAGE		Okay, I’ll be back in a second.

CAGE		Brother? Nooooooo!

CAGE		Reveal yourself!

LOOKALIKE		Every clan has their secret weapon. But I have the most powerful one of them all.

LOOKALIKE/HIROSHI	Deceit.

CAGE		You killed our master. Why?

HIROSHI		When did you become so naïve?

CAGE		You have no honor! No respect for the Code!

HIROSHI		I live by my own code.


CAGE		You had everything!

HIROSHI		No, I had nothing! Master Fumitaka always loved you most. I knew you would  always be my enemy.

CAGE		Fumitaka chose you.

HIROSHI		Only because I made it so. When we were young, my deceit was subtle. Master  Fumitaka seeing you steal an apple or hearing you tell a little white lie. Before long, he couldn’t quite trust you. That made him very sad. It broke his poor little heart. Needless to say, I started looking very promising to him. He gave you everything! No! I waited years to take over the clan! But our beloved Fumitaka decided to call for peace, bring you and all the others back into the fold.

HIROSHI		I intercepted his message. He was going to make you his second. Seeing you as master of the Lost Clan, upholding the Code so well. Practically made me vomit. That is why now, you must die!

CAGE		Brother.

BECKER		Cage of the Lost Clan, you are a great warrior and an honorable ninja. As leader of the Southern Clan, I promise you your homeland will be protected.

CAGE		Don’t protect us. Respect us. Come on, brother. Let’s go home.
