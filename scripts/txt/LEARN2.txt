(THOMAS & FRIENDS)
(LEARN WITH THOMAS)
(BE THERE FOR YOUR SIBLINGS)

THOMAS	hello everyone! today i learnt a very important lesson about...  being there for your siblings...  when there was a heavy snow fall on sodor, it was donald and douglas' job to clear the tracks. the two brothers argued over which tracks to clear first. they got very angry and pushed and pulled so much that the coupling on douglas' tender broke. and then there was trouble. donald was so cross he left douglas behind in the snow!  when i told donald that he had his brother's tender, donald was very worried. douglas had no coal or water, which meant he couldn't move! even though they had argued, donald still cared about his brother, and so he raced off to rescue him.  and for once the two brothers agreed on something. they were both very pleased to see each other! so remember, even if you argue with your siblings you should always be there for each other!
