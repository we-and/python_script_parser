
ZICO	Hmm… what suspicious-looking tracks…

ZICO	Oh, no! No-no-no-no-no! Stop! I’m going to get that shot no matter what!

MAGRA	Those jackals nearly got away with our supplies last night. It looks like someone’s been nodding off on his watch again.

SKINNY	M-m-magra! It wasn’t us!

RAGEAR	So, I wonder who it could have been, then? By the way, where's Grey?

MAGRA	Grey!

ZICO	Where on earth is it? Where is it? Where?

ZICO	Right then… Zombies, vampires, goblins – no, that’s not it. Mermaids, dragons, orcs… werewolves… Aha!

ZICO	Wolf.

ZICO	Wolves!

ZICO	Wooooolves!

GREY	Sheep! A whole village of sheep! Ripe for the picking!

MAGRA	We do not hunt for sport, Gray. We catch only what we need to survive. Every life is sacred.

GREY	OK… If you say so.

MAGRA	Listen up, pack! This is our new home. This is where we’ll live long and prosper!

MAGRA	I have been your leader for over a hundred moons… and now… it’s time for me to retire!

WOLVES	But why? Magra, don’t leave us! What’ll become of us?

MAGRA	The law of our ancestors provides that the strongest member of the pack must prove his right to lead by vanquishing his rivals... Any contenders?

WOLVES	I think I could... It’s been my lifelong dream! I’m a born leader!

RAGEAR	Me!

WOLVES	On second thoughts, I’m not that bothered... I might try next time... Who needs the hassle? I don’t know what I was thinking. 

MAGRA	Well, are you going to let Ragear lead you… without so much as a fight?

SKINNY	M-m-m-m... M-m-m...

GREY	Me!

RAGEAR	Let’s raise the stakes. I say the fight should be… to the death?

GREY	What do you mean “to the death”? How about we have a dance-off instead!

MAGRA	In three days. At noon. Grey versus Ragear. The winner will be the new Head of the Pack.

SKINNY	M…meee!

BELGOUR	Hey, Zico, cut it out, please!

ZICO	But not everyone’s up ye…But not everyone’s up yet!

CLIFF	What do you think you’re doing? What is it this time? Bird flu?

BELGOUR	Friends! As head of the flock, I have some terrible news to tell you: I… spilled the salt. It was an accident. I was having breakfast and about to salt my omelet when all of a sudden I… nodded off! By the time I woke up, it was too late – the salt had been spilled.

IKE	Moz, just approach her already!

MOZ	Are you kidding, Ike? She is so… She’s so… What if I go up to her, and she just… she just…

IKE	Just what? Wallops you? Bites you? (pause) Falls for you?

MOZ	Quiet, you!

BELGOUR	Everyone knows what a bad ome-eee-en this is. And now look what’s happened! Over to you, Zico…

ZICO	Brothers and sisters! Under cover of night, the enemy has infiltrated our valley! Behold!

MOZ	We've been attacked by… firewood?

ZICO	We've been attacked by wolves!

SHEEP	Whatever! Nonsense! You and your monsters again, Zico.

ZICO	So you don’t believe me? Then take a look at this!

BELGOUR	And so, henceforth, the North Meadow is off-limits! I forbid you to go there!

IKE	But that’s where the best clover is! What am I… I mean, we… going to eat?

BELGOUR	I don’t want to hear anything about it! Bucho, lock the gate!

BELGOUR	Right… Now we’re safe and sound…

GREY	So, Bianca... you going to the party tonight?

BIANCA	Depends. If my date can manage to show up on time.

GREY	Who’s the lucky guy? He must be a handsome devil!

BIANCA	Stop goofing off. Are you ready to fight Ragear?

GREY	I was born ready!

BIANCA	You’d better win. If Ragear became the Head of the Pack, we all would have troubles.

GREY	Close your eyes.

GREY	You can open them now.

BIANCA	What a sweet surprise!

GREY	What, this?! Ha! Wait till tonight. Now, that will be a surprise!

GREY	Looks like Ragear is violating the hunting ban.

GREY	He needs to be taught a lesson!

BIANCA	Don’t get involved with them. It's time for you to...

GREY	It's time to go!

BIANCA	...grow up.

SARABI	Bianca! What surprise were you talking about?

BIANCA	I think Grey's going to pop the question tonight!

LEAH	What question?

SARABI	…will you… marry… me?

LEAH	Aaaah... Oh! Ooohhh... That’s sooooo cool!

SHIA	Oh! Oh! Look – that one looks like a fish!

XAVI	With huge sharp teeth! Everyone’s banned from the North Meadow… and here we are…

XAVI	Shia, I don’t think this was such a great idea.

SHIA	Don’t be such a scaredy cat! What do you think could happen?

XAVI	It could happen… wolves?!
RAGEAR	Hurry up! Knuckleheads!

HOBBLER	But Magra said we couldn’t hunt yet!

RAGEAR	Magra’s an old sap. Soon, I’ll do away with these wimpy laws…

SKINNY	But you s-still have to b-beat Grey first!

GREY	Looks like someone’s ignoring the leader’s orders?

RAGEAR	Shouldn’t you be chasing your tail or something?

GREY	I’ve dropped everything, to warn you…

RAGEAR	About what?

GREY	The tree.

RAGEAR	What tree?

SHIA	Well, don’t dally. Get on with it – gobble me up!

GREY	Ha-ha-ha! Gobble you up? No offense, kid, but you’re too puny even for a snack!

GREY	Hurry home! Go on now – off you go!

LYRA	Have you seen my brother?

LYRA	Moz, have you seen Shia?

MOZ	I errr… I not… I mean… not haven’t… uh… no…

LYRA	Ike, what about you?

LYRA	Shia? You weren’t just at the North Meadow, were you?

SHIA	Of course not, Lyra, don’t be silly! I was at school… Why would I go to the North Meadow? It’s way too dangerous out there!

HOBBLER	...and boom - at full speed! Into the only tree in the field!

HOBBLER	You should’ve seen his stupid face!

RAGEAR	Whose face, Hobbler? Tell me, I like funny stories too.

HOBBLER	I... Just... about...

VERSION HOBBLER	I... Just... about... Him!!!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE 	An ode to Ragear!

RAM	His eyes are all funny! Hardly any teeth! Got paws like a bunny! And dumb as a sheep!

RAM	Dumb! Dum-dum-dumb! Dumb!

GREY	Surprise!!!

LEAH	I don’t get it. Is this Grey’s way of proposing to Bianca?

SARABI	That was quite a surprise...

RAGEAR	My turn to be funny!

GREY	What do you know about jokes? Who would want a grouch like you for a Head of the Pack?

RAGEAR	You think they’d prefer a clown? Why don’t we ask them?

RAGEAR	Raise your paw if you want a strong, smart and experienced leader.

RAGEAR	Raise your paws!

GREY	And who’d like to live in a happy, friendly pack where no one bullies anyone?

SKINNY	It’s a d-d-d...

HOBBLER	Draw!

GREY	Hey, Bianca didn't vote yet!

GREY	Bianca, honey, raise your hand! Come on!

GREY	Bianca, wait!

GREY	Doggone it! How could you vote for somebody else?! 

BIANCA	You’re not ready to lead this pack, Grey! I don’t think you’ll ever be ready!(pause) And you’re certainly not ready for marriage!

BIANCA	How can you even talk about a wedding when all you think about are those …those childish pranks?!

GREY	A wedding? Who’s getting married?

BIANCA	For the past month all you talked about was: “Oh, I’ve got a surprise! Such a surprise!!! You’ll go nuts!”

GREY	Well… Everyone did go nuts!

BIANCA	I’m tired of waiting, Grey.

GREY	Waiting for what?

BIANCA	A miracle, Grey! That you’ll finally… change!

GREY	But I love you! 

BIANCA	Take care of yourself, Grey. I’m through with you. 

GREY	Bianca, wait! I will change! I promise! Bianca… Bianca! BIANCA!!!

RAGEAR	Out of my way!

RAGEAR	You see, Grey is no leader – he’s just a clown! He turns everything into a joke!

MAGRA	You’re right, he really is not mature enough… But you… you place you own needs above the pack’s.

RAGEAR	And?

MAGRA	And — a fight will decide it all.

BARON	My dear audience! Coming up next we have magical wonders and fortune telling! But first! A savage Himalayan bear!

GREY	Ha! It’s just a hamster!
VOICE	Wooolf!

GREY	Hey, wait!

GREY	But you promised magical…

GREY	…wonders? Can you work… wonders?

MAMI	Right… we’ll need some… bravery potion!

GREY	No, no, I don’t need bravery!

MAMI	That’s for me!

MAMI	You’ve come to the right place! If it’s wonders you seek, you need to see Mami!

GREY	And where can I find this… Mami?

MAMI	It’s me. I’m Mami. Hee-hee-hee.

MAMI	Take this! It’ll bring you luck!

GREY	I don't need a horseshoe! I need…

MAMI	OooKay, I get it!

MAMI	The pants of Agility? Helm of stability? Chastity belt? Cube of delight? Bucket of nasties? Balls of madness?

GREY	No, I need...

MAMI	Bald patches treatment? 

GREY	Nooo… that’s not it… I need… to change! I need… Bianca to love me… again!

MAMI	You need her to love you? Or you need to change? I don’t get it. Ah! Change so that she loves you… Listen… It’s been a long day. Why don’t you come back tomorrow?

GREY	Bianca won’t wait.

MAMI	OK, here it is – the “transmutation potion.” What on earth is that?… Blah blah blah, three drops after… there you go – transmutation! At midnight… uh huh…

MAMI	Here, give it a go!

GREY	Have I changed? Did it work?

GREY	Will Bianca love me now?

MAMI	Oh! Oh, Bianca will go wild… You bet!

GREY	Thanks, Mami! Ha-ha, thank you!

MAMI	Not at all… really.

GREY	Bianca!

MAMI	It’s time for us to move on again, Baron.

BARON	Oh! The open road is a gypsy’s lot…

MAMI	Run!

GREY	Hooray! I have changed, Bianca, a miracle has happened! I’ve — chan… 

RAGEAR	Mmmm… Have you ever seen (pause) a steak come to dinner all by itself?

 GREY	Hey you!!!

GREY	Did I forget to take that stupid pelt off? 

GREY	No-no-no-no-no-no-no! Hold on a second! She told me… Here you are, drink up… So I drank it…

 GREY	And something! Went! Wrong!!!

 GREY	Oh no… Guys! Guys…

SKINNY	I g-g-got him! I got him!

MOZ	Bro? Hey bro, are you alive? 

VOICES	I’ve never seen him before. Let’s take him to Lyra’s house. He looks like he needs help!

GREY	Um...m...m...

LYRA	Don't get up – you need rest!

GREY	Phew, I just had the worst dream. I turned into a sheep!

LYRA	A sheep? Well, that's quite a dream!

GREY	Where's Bianca? Oh! You're a sheep!

LYRA	That’s right! I’m a sheep, and you're a ram.

GREY	What?

GREY	Aaaaaah! What have you done to me?

BELGOUR	You broke the mirror. You’re going to have very bad luck!

GREY	It couldn’t get much worse.

ZICO	Your face is suspiciously familiar.

GREY	What? Who? I’ve never seen you before in my life!

ZICO	Mmm... Not necessarily… I wonder...

BELGOUR	Tell us, where did you come from?

GREY	Me? I'm from... over there.

MOZ	From the east then. He’s from the Eastern Herd!

ZICO	There’s no one left from the Eastern Herd!

GREY	It’s just me… all my relatives were eaten…

LYRA	Poor guy!

ZICO	But I heard that they moved down south.

GREY	Yes… that's where they were eaten, in the south... by southern wolves.

GREY	My father sent me to get provisions. Go to the woods, Grey, he said, and get some… uh… pine cones.

IKE	Pine cones?

ZICO	Grey? What a strange name…

GREY	Oh… it’s… a nickname. My father named us after the colors of the rainbow, and I was the eighth child in the family...

MOZ	Oh, a nickname. That’s so cool! Everyone calls me… Master Moz!

IKE	And who calls you that?

MOZ	Well… in certain circles...

IKE	Nobody, nowhere.

BELGOUR	Look after him Moz…

MOZ	When I eat too much clover, my nose starts itching. But too much sedge makes my ears itch! What’s more...

MOZ	Hey, bro, what are you doing?

GREY	I’m having the world’s worst nightmare and I can’t wake up!


MOZ	What happened?

GREY	That’s what I’m trying to figure out. What. Happened. To me!

MOZ	So… I…

GREY	Be quiet and let me think!

MOZ	Hey, I can be quiet! Many are envious of just how quiet I can be! Once I was quiet for two whole hours. I thought my head would explode from the words building up inside!


GREY	I was going to see Bianca… What happened next? I left and…

MOZ	Hey, bro, we need to get to know each other better. What do you think? Do you like clover? I adore it!

GREY	I fell down! That’s what happened! I just need to fall down again.

MOZ	… of course, I’m no Ike, but I have been known to eat five, or even six cups of clover in one sitting. Can you imagine that?

GREY	And everything will go back to normal.

MOZ	Go… went… gone… OK, whatever you say!

MOZ	Hey, bro, you’re so lucky it was Lyra who took care of you. She’s so… just so… super-awesome! Don’t you think she’s amazing? Don’t you think? Right? Am I right? Huh?

CLIFF	He seems to think he’s a bird. What an oddball!

IKE	Just like you. But the other way around.

CLIFF	No. I am definitely a ram!

LYRA	Poor thing. He must be grieving for his family!

LYRA	He’s about to leap to his death!

MOZ	Me! Me! I got you!

MOZ	Got you…

GREY	This obviously isn’t working… What am I supposed to do now?

MOZ	I have an idea – get off me… Bro, you, weigh as much as a Himalayan bear!

BARON	…Himalayan bear!

GREY	A BEAR! Gypsies! Mami! You old hag! Thank you, Master Moose!

GREY	You’ve been a lovely audience. Bye now!

ZICO	This is all ve-ery suspicious.

GREY	They… left...

BIANCA 	They’ve still not found him?

RAGEAR 	He probably just ran away. To avoid the duel...

BIANCA	We both know that’s not true.

RAGEAR	Well, you did tell him to get lost.

BIANCA	No. We’ve just split up.

RAGEAR	Ah well, what’s the difference?

SHIA	Grey!

LYRA	Morning!

LYRA	Sorry to wake you, but I’ve got a customer coming in early. Wash up and have some breakfast.


SHIA	It’s carrot pudding today. And pumpkin mousse! Ble-e-eh!

GREY	Ble-e-eh!

SHIA	Sis! Can Grey stay with us forever?

LYRA	Morning! Come on in.

FRUMPY EWE	Some weather. I can't do anything with my hair!

LYRA	Be with you in a sec.

SHIA	But sis, what about the fair?

LYRA	Oh, I'm sorry. I completely forgot! Maybe you could take him?

GREY	Why not! The fair’s where I belong!

SHIA	Please! There’ll be booths and rides, gypsies and clowns, ice cream and pies!

GREY	Gypsies? Did you say there’ll be gypsies?

SHIA	Well, yeah… They might even have a bear!

MOZ	Hey, buddy! Where have you been? Hey! I’ve still got so much to tell you. I hope you’re ready for a sheeptacular day of storytelling!

GREY	All right! Run! Hurry!

LYRA	Oh, hi, Moz.

MOZ	Err… flip fluff... umm.

MOZ	Oh, there you are. Are you going somewhere?

SHIA 	To the fair.

GREY	 No, nowhere!	

MOZ	The fair! Cool! I’ll come with you.

MOZ	Your sister’s really cool, Shia! She’s pretty, smart, knows how to treat all kinds of ailments… and she cuts wool!
MOZ	I’ll let you in on a secret: one of my pals is head over heels in love with her! And they’ll probably get married one day.

SHIA	Is that after he manages to say something other than “fluff flip” to her?

MOZ	I… baah… Ah, you… you pesky troublemaker!

MOZ	I don’t know why, but as soon as I see Lyra, I…

LAMBS	It’s my turn now! You just went! Let me!

MOZ	… all I can get out is gibberish!

GREY	It’s not like you say clever things when you’re not with her. Listen, I’ve got to find the gypsies…

BELGOUR	You… again! Oh, you’ll bring us b-aaa-d luck! Good day, Zico.

ZICO	Not necessarily…. I wonder…

MOZ	Peek-a-boo, buddy! Are you lost?

GREY	Listen, I’m not your buddy. Just leave me alone!

MOZ	I get it! You're grumpy because you're starving. No problem. Let’s get you the best food in the world!

GREY	What’s this? Cornflowers? Parsley leaves? How can you possibly…

GREY	…mmm… not like it?

MOZ	Hey! The competition’s about to start!

GREY	What competition?

MOZ	The Horn and Hoof Competition!

HOST	And fight!

HOST	And now, the long-awaited standoff! The unbeatable champion is arrived fight with any challengers! Please welcome Fierce Louis!

GREY	You mean that little shrimp is the your champion?

HOST	Aaand we have our first challenger!

GREY	Wh… What?

HOST	And Fight!

SPECTATORS	Hey! Biting? That’s against the rules!

LOUIS	Come back when you’ve learned to fight like a real ram!

GREY	But I'm not a ra…

LYRA	How could you let it happen? All kind of competitions are contraindicative for him!

SHIA	I wasn’t even there, sis! It’s all Moz’s fault!

CLIFF	Watch oooout!

CLIFF	What’s up with you? Bad day, eh?

GREY	That’s an understatement… I really miss my pack… That’s something you should understand.

CLIFF	Me? Why?

GREY	You must miss your family too… You’re a bird, after all.

CLIFF	I’m no bird. I'm a ram. This is my family.

CLIFF VERSION	I’m not a bird. Vice versa. I'm a ram. This is my family.

GREY	But I've seen you fly!

CLIFF	I saw you fly today too… Does that make you a bird?

LYRA	Where could he have gone? It’s so dangerous to go this far from the village. He could run into wolves.

HOBBLER	Wolves?

LYRA	That’s it. Wolves.

CLIFF	I’m not good at landing. So guess what? You know what they called me? The flying… sea cow! The sea cow, can you imagine?! Some family...

LYRA	Woooooooooooolves!

GREY	Wolves? Where?

HOBBLER	So… what do we do now?

SKINNY	G-g-g-rab her?

GREY	Guys!

SKINNY	Wh... what's gotten into him?

GREY	Guys! Am I glad to see y…

GREY	Wait!

SHIA	Wow!

GREY	Guys! Wait!

SKINNY	N-not on your l-l-life!

GREY	Skinny! Hobbler! It’s me, Grey!

HOBBLER	He knows our names! And called himself Grey!

SKINNY	I d-don’t like this!

MAMI	Look, at this rate we’re never getting out of here... You’ve circled around again, dumbo!

GREY	Mami!!! Mami!!!

BARON	You should probably hi... hide...

GREY	Where’s the Gypsy woman? Where's Mami? I really need to talk to her!

BARON	Erm... She's not here.

GREY	I'll wait!

BARON	No, I mean... I’m afraid... she has left us... (looks up at the sky) She’s dead, I mean.

GREY	No way. What am I supposed to do now? How will I become a wolf? Potions! She had potions!

BARON	Listen, why would you want to turn into a wolf anyway? You're a ram! 

GREY	I’m a wolf!

BARON	Hehehe, buddy... If it looks like a ram, walks like a ram, and bleats like a ram, it’s probably a ram.

GREY	But I’m... a wolf...

SHIA	Two wolves! With one blow! And he chased them away!

GREY	Awsome, guys!

MOZ	LIGHTS!

EVERYONE	Surprise!

GREY	Why?! Wh-w… Why?!

BELGOUR	We’ve organized this party in your honor! Truly speaking… we started without you… But anyway, we’re happy to welcome you to our big happy family! You’re one of us now!

ZICO	Not necessarily… I do wonder... Hey!

BELGOUR	We are awarding you the title of Wolf Tamer!

IKE	Yup! That’s what the cake says! Said…

MOZ	May I have… this dance?

CLIFF	Good. So, you walk straight up to her, give her the bouquet… and say?

MOZ	Lyra! Would you like to dan…floop!

SHEEP	Eat, eat, eat, eat!

SHIA	Grey, that move, can you beat anyone with it?

GREY	Totally! It’s the super-move!

SHIA	Even wolves?

GREY	Easy!

SHIA	So who can’t it beat?

GREY	Well, only… Fierce Louis!

LOUIS	Troublemakers!

LYRA	Don’t get on Grey’s nerves! And, besides – it’s late. Off to bed!

SHIA	I’ve got a brilliant idea! Let’s go to the… (he whispers something incomprehensible)

MOZ	Walk up, present yourself, talk. Walk up…

LYRA	Grey! I've never met a ram quite like you before… You’re… special!

GREY	Oh, Lyra… You have no idea!

GREY	Hey! There’s some cake left. Shall I get you some?

MOZ	Lyra! Would you like flop… clah… pook… …together… with me?

MOZ	Moz, what a dumb sheep you are!

XAVI	Come on, let’s go back. I've got a bad feeling about this.

SHIA	Don’t chicken out. If we run into a wolf, I’ll use my super-move and... send him flying! Look!

SHIA	What are you worried about? Just look how small they are! They can't even see us!

RAGEAR	Face it: Grey ran away. He was scared and fled from responsibility. That means I’m to be the Head of the Pack without a duel, right?

MAGRA	No. That’s not how it works, Ragear. You know full well that anyone can stand in for the contender in his absence.

MAGRA	And I’ll do it. I’ll take Grey’s place.

RAGEAR	But... you were going to retire!

MAGRA	A leader that doesn’t respect the laws of our ancestors will bring pack to the death. As long as I'm alive, you’ll never be leader!

RAGEAR	Oh, you’re right...

RAGEAR	But only as long as you’re alive!

LYRA	Shia? Shia? Shia! Shia!

LYRA	Shia!

RAGEAR	Friends, a tragedy has occurred. While searching for runaway Grey, our wise and courageous leader Magra missed his footing and…

RAGEAR	… fell off the cliff. He's dead now.

BIANCA	What are you hiding Ragear? Was it you who pushed him?

RAGEAR	Bianca dear… understandably, you're upset. We all are… but…

BIANCA	So I assume you'll be our new leader?

RAGEAR	Magra left the pack in good paws. Tomorrow I…

BIANCA	You can’t be Head of the Pack without winning a duel!

RAGEAR	I am abolishing that rule! Along with all your so-called… laws of the ancestors!

RAGEAR	The ceremony will be held at dawn… I’ve already picked out a juicy young ram.

BELGOUR	What were you doing in the North Meadow anyway? I forbade you to go there!

XAVI	Me and Shia wanted to try out the super-move. Grey said it would work against a wolf… but it… didn’t.

LYRA	Grey! How could you be so irresponsible?

GREY	I'm sorry, Lyra! I had no idea they’d go and… try it out…

LYRA	You could have if you’d thought about it first! You’re so careless …

CLIFF	I saw EVERYTHING! Shia’s alive! They've got him in a pit next to a fire. It looks like they plan on roasting him!

IKE	Well, that’s something… Just saying…

GREY	So, Belgour, what's your rescue plan?

BELGOUR	Plan? Rescue? Are you crazy? We’re sheep, not navy seals! There's nothing we can do.

GREY	But aren’t you the head of the flock?

BELGOUR	Of course! Until it’s something terrifying…

GREY	What kind of sheepish…

GREY	Friends! I… I know a secret path to the wolves’ lair. And if luck is with me… I’ll wrestle Shia out of their paws!

ZICO	A secret path? Really? I wonder how he knows.

LYRA	What’s… happening?

MOZ	Grey’s going to rescue Shia!

LYRA	How? Alone?

MOZ	Er... Alone? Of course not… How can he go without me?

GREY	What’s gotten into you Moz?

MOZ	I must confess… My friend who’s in love with Lyra is actually me!

GREY	Who would’ve thought?

GREY	Okay, this is it...

GREY	Remember, we go on my command!

MOZ	Sir, yes sir! 

GREY	Skinny, hey, Skinny!

SKINNY	Huh?

GREY	It’s me.

GREY	Shhh! Don’t turn around!

SKINNY	Erm... W-w-w...wh... wh...

GREY	If they ask… You never saw me... It’s easier to lie when you’re telling the truth...

SKINNY	Uh-huh...

GREY	Is the lamb in the pit?

SKINNY	W-w-w-we...

GREY	Just nod if he is.

GREY	Sorry, buddy... Shia, you there? 

SKINNY	Hey! HEY! Wh-h-h... 

SKINNY	Who. Are. You?

SKINNY	G...G...Gr...

GREY	So you pounded that wolf right on the head – bam! Look, Shia’ll tell you!

SHIA	Yup! You grabbed a stick and – bam! – pounded the one on the right! And you’re like, “Do not mess.”

GREY	Then you – boom! – take the other one out! “with Master...”

GREY AND SHIA	“...Moz!”

MOZ	I was whacked so hard on the head that I don’t remember any of it.

BUCHO	They’re back!

BELGOUR	I told you so! The stars were favorable tonight!

SHIA	I’m so sorry, sis. I’ll never disobey you again! Cross my heart!
LYRA	You’re alive!

IKE	How did you do it?

GREY	It was all him! It wouldn’t have worked without him!

MOZ	I… I… err… fluff… flip…

SHIA	Honestly, Grey, I thought that you and Lira be a couple.

GREY	Heck, Shia, I’ve already got a girl. And she’s like no sheep on earth.

GREY	Bianca… Bianca… 

GREY	Bianca!

BIANCA	How do you know my name?!

GREY	It’s me! Grey!

GREY	It’s me…

BIANCA	… Grey? It’s impossible. How did this happen to you?

GREY	Gypsy Mami did it. That harebrained rabbit gave me the wrong magic potion!

BIANCA	A magic potion? What for?

GREY	Well… You wanted me to change… And I think I just tried too hard… Then I fell in with the rams… By the way, those guys are great…

BIANCA	Things are awful, Grey! Ragear’s the leader of the pack now, and he’s terrible.

GREY	How did Magra let it happen? 

BIANCA	Oh, you don’t know, do you? (pause) Magra… he’s gone. He died.

BIANCA	What have you done, Grey? To yourself and to all of us?

GREY	I… I meant well, believe me! I’ll make things… right…

BIANCA	Go away, Grey! Please, go away and stay out of my sight… forever!

ZICO	So that explains everything…

RAGEAR	What? What do you mean “taken”? By whom?

SKINNY	I-i-it w-was G-g-g G-r…

RAGEAR	What are you mumbling?

RAGEAR	What is he mumbling?

HOBBLER	He’s trying to say that it was Grey.

SKINNY	Uh-huh...

SKINNY	He’s a r-r-ra…

RAGEAR	He’s a what? A rabbit? A radish? A rat? A rag doll? A raspberry? All right. He’s a what?

HOBBLER	Grey's turned into a ram!

RAGEAR	Hmmmm… Grey’s… a ram? Ha-ha-ha. The irony!

RAGEAR	Not a word of this to anyone… There was no Grey… only rams! Dumb, useless creatures!

RAGEAR	Today, they take away our prey. Tomorrow, will they stifle us in our sleep?

RAGEAR	Look what they did to our brothers!

RAGEAR	Are we really going to let them get away with this?

WOLVES	No! We won’t! We won’t let them!

RAGEAR	No. We won’t. They will pay for what they’ve done.

RAGEAR	We'll kill them! Kill them all! And bring back order to the valley! Just as great Magra bade us!

CROWD	Yes! We will get our revenge! Who do they think they are? We'll kill them! Kill them!

ZICO	And i’m telling you the truth: you mustn’t trust him for he is a wolf in sheep’s clothing! Who in their right mind would trust him? You?

ZICO	Would you trust someone who has no place among us? Would you trust a traitor?!

ZICO	What did the wolves promise you? Your life in exchange for the whole flock?

GREY	If you’re trying to mke a joke, now’s not the best time.

ZICO	I have proof that he is – a spy!

IKE	What the..?

MOZ	Buddy... But how?

ZICO	This “Grey” of yours is, in fact, a wolf in sheep’s clothing. He weaseled his way into our good graces so he could betray us. Just as he betrayed his brothers from the Eastern Herd!

BELGOUR	This morning my head was so itchy I knew at once that something bad was about to happen.

IKE	You should have washed it yesterday, and then nothing would’ve happened!

LYRA	This is ridiculous! Grey helped save my brother! Didn’t he, Moz?

MOZ	I... don’t know. I passed out… And when I came around everything had been rescued without me…

LYRA	How could you…?

MOZ	I don't know how! I passed out!

ZICO	No doubt he arranged it all with the wolves. Belgour! We must drive this imposter away!

GREY	Drive me away? I’m going anyway! Useless, dumb creatures! You downer, stalking around, scribbling things in your notebook! Have you noticed, Zico, that nobody actually likes you?

GREY	And what does Ike like doing? Ike likes eating! He just eats and eats! Can you even fit through the door?

BELGOUR	One moment!

GREY	And the head of the flock! He trembles at every superstition. Too busy fear-mongering to lead a fly! Everything’s a bad om-e-e-en!

GREY VERSION	And the head of the flock! Black cat has crossed my path, and for today I can’t lead you, folks! Everything’s a bad om-e-e-en!

GREY	Mr. Loose Lips here just drones on and on, with no end in sight! Blah-blah-blah, day in and day out! Except when it counts – like telling Lyra how he feels – then it’s all fluff, flip…!

CLIFF	Hey! Easy now!

GREY	And you – you’re no ram! Don’t you get it? You’re a pelican! Who’s not brave enough to go home.

GREY	I’ve had it!

CLIFF	I'm… a seagull...

BUCHO	And I even baked him a cake…

SHIA	Grey, wait!

SHIA	Why are you doing this? I know that you’re actually good!

GREY	No I'm not. I’m evil. An evil wolf!

SHIA	I know, Grey… I recognized you at once. You let me go home that time in the meadow. How can you be evil?

GREY	I'm sorry, kid. Zico’s right: there’s no place for me here.

MAMI	Well, hi there.

MAMI	It’s lucky I found you… There’s something I remembered. At midday tomorrow, the potion’s spell, heh-heh, becomes irreversible – you will remain a ram forever. But there is something we can do.

MAMI	The spell can be broken using magic dew. It falls only once a year in the glade under that red pine tree there. And tomorrow morning is that very day!

GREY	At last! I can go back to my own kind!

MAMI	Yes, go for it! It’s the only way to save your life! Starting tomorrow, it’ll be very dangerous to be a ram.

GREY	What…. Why do you say that?

MAMI	Well, because the wolves are on the war path! They’ll be attacking the village by morning.

GREY	But they’ll… kill them all!

MAMI	Of course! You don’t need a fortune teller to know that. Hee-hee. So if you value your life, stay away from the village. You’d better get to the pine as fast as you can. You can still make it.

GREY	Yes, I still can.

MAMI	Grey! That’s not the way to the pine!

GREY	I know!

HOBBLER	Boss, everyone’s ready. Only Bianca’s missing. She’s gone!

RAGEAR	Who needs her…

RAGEAR VERSION	We don’t need her

GREY	Let go! The village is in danger!

ZICO	You let go! You’re a spy and a traitor!

BELGOUR	What's going on here?

GREY	The wolves are out on a hunt!

ZICO	How do you know, eh?
GREY	Well, since I’m a spy, I probably would know, wouldn’t I?

ZICO	Not necessarily! I wonder… What if you’re not a spy?

ZICO	Maybe you made me believe that you are a spy, so that nobody would know that you’re in fact...

ZICO	…not a spy at all!

GREY	The wolves plan to attack the village in the morning.

BELGOUR	We must… run! Gather your valuables and run!

GREY	It’s too late! Even if anyone does manage to leave, they’ll be doomed to spend their whole life roaming from place to place.

LYRA	What are we to do?

IKE	Personally, I’m in favor of roaming.

GREY	There’s only one thing we can do! Stay and fight back!

GREY	Wait! Wait… We may not have fangs and claws, but our strength lies elsewhere. Our strength is in our unity! If we all pull together, we can fight them off! From here on out, we are a pack! A pack of wild sheep!

MOZ	That’s my best pal, you know.

SHIA	Grey, you're back!

GREY	So, are you going to show the wolves your super-move?

SHIA	Yes!

GREY	Belgour! While there are no black cats in town, we have nothing to fear. Ike, you’re in charge of the food, as you’re the expert. Moz! You’ll be my aide-de-camp. Zico, you’re the smartest of us all. You’ll be responsible for planning! Cliff! You…

GREY	Where's Cliff?

BELGOUR	Cliff… flew away…

GREY	Well then, we’ll just have to manage without him!

BARON	Hmmm… It looks like we’re back where we started.

BIANCA	So, I take it you’re Mami? Is it your potion that’s behind all this mess?

RAGEAR	Brainless sheep. It’s time to show you who’s boss! Attack!

RAGEAR	What are you… you idiots! Get back in formation!

RAGEAR	Onward!

IKE	Let’s rock!

RAGEAR	Candy? Are you serious? You think you can scare us with candy?

SEAGULL 1	Alpha, enemy build-up below in quadrant B11-12.

SEAGULL 2	Delta, commence bombing on arrival.

SEAGULL 1	Copy that.

CLIFF	Wow, guys! How are you doing that?

SHEEP	Look there! Seagulls! Cliff’s back!

RAGEAR	What’s wrong with you? They’re just bees! Onward!

GREY	Attack!

MOZ	Don’t mess… with Master… Moz!!! Oops, sorry!

SKINNY	I’ll r-r-r… R… r… uh… r-r…

SKINNY	Rip you to shreds! Hey!

SKINNY	Thanks, speech therapist!

GREY	Belgour! Now’s the time!

BELGOUR	Attention! Plan Be-e-e-e-e!

RAGEAR	They're retreating! Victory will soon be ours!

GREY	Over here! Over here! Hurry!

WOLVES	I can smell them! We’re gonna get you! You’ll soon pay for this!

SKINNY	Water! We’re going to drown! Save yourselves!

HOBBLER	Boss, it looks like those dumb sheep have tricked us…

GREY	The water is filling the cave. They’re going to drown!

SKINNY	Grey! Save us!

HOBBLER	Please! Grey!

GREY	Guys! We can’t do this! They’re my pack… my family. We gotta rescue them!

ZICO	Rescue?! As soon as we rescue them, they’ll devour us! They’re the enemy, remember?

GREY	We gotta help them… Every life is… sacred!

LYRA	Shia!

SHIA	Folks! We can’t fight evil with evil! We will end up just as bad as they are! But we’re not like that, are we? We’re the good guys!

BELGOUR	What are you doing, staring like dumb sheep? You heard him. Now – to the rescue!

ZICO	What do you think you're doing? Are you all nuts? If you let them out, it’ll be… curtains for all us!

RAGEAR	We won't lay a finger on anyone, I swear!

ZICO	But can we trust him? Not necessarily!

BELGOUR	Zico!

RAGEAR	Thanks… I have to admit, not even I thought that you, sheep…

RAGEAR	…were so dumb!

RAGEAR	One more step, and I’ll off this squirt!

LYRA	Let him go, you monster!

RAGEAR	What are you all waiting for? Kill them!

GREY	How could you forget Magra’s legacy so quickly? Not so long ago you were a proud wolf pack. Now you’re just a bunch of wretched jackals!

RAGEAR	Magra? You’re a fine one to talk about Magra! He perished… all because of you!

SHIA	Liar! Xavi and I saw you talking to the old wolf and then you pushed him off a cli…

RAGEAR	Pack! You take orders from me!

GREY	You’re not their leader, Ragear! You must win a duel first…

RAGEAR	A duel? You’ll get your duel! Dumb sheep…

LOUIS	I taught him that!

GREY	At midday, the spell becomes irreversible, and I’ll be a sheep forever.

RAGEAR	Grey, that’s what you’ve always been. A dumb, useless sheep!

BIANCA	Better a sheep than a mean, nasty worm like yourself, Ragear.

BIANCA	And no magic dew can ever turn you into a wolf…

GREY	I think… it’s too… late…

RAGEAR	So who’s your leader now? Who’s the wolf here?

GREY	I'm the wolf, Ragear! I! Am! The wolf!

GREY	As long as I'm alive, you’ll never be leader!

GREY	…worm

RAGEAR	Just you wait…

ZICO	Well, I never!

GREY	Bianca, there’s something I’ve been wanting to ask you for quite some time...

GREY	…Will you marry me?

BELGOUR	By the power vested in me… by the moon and… the stars, I now pronounce you husband and wife! Love and cherish each other fore-e-e-ver! You may kiss the bride…


MOZ	Of course, I’m no wordsmith and I have to admit that I’m a ram of few words… but…

LYRA	Oh just shut up and kiss me!

MAMI	Phew… thank goodness everything turned out well in the end… Just as I predicted, of course…

BARON	Is that right? Did you?

MAMI	Well… everything except Grey turning into a ram. And the wolves attacking the village.

BARON	…and the rest… Yeah, I get it.

ZICO	Not necessarily. I wonder!
