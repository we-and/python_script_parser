ANNE		Chicken's almost done.

JENNIFER	Mom...

MARGARET	I'll start preparing the salad if you like.

ANNE		Sure that'd be great, Margaret.  I'll get you a few things for it.

JENNIFER	Mom, I'm hungry.

ANNE		We'll eat soon, Jennifer, okay? As soon as your father gets here.

ANNE		Do you think we've got enough beer?

DAVID		He won't want beer when he gets home. He's gonna need whisky.

MARGARET	Now David, don't go getting Christopher drunk now.

DAVID		Why not? He's on shore leave, he can do whatever he wants.

ANNE		I hope he'll want to spend time with his family.

MARGARET	What about John? Is he planning on showing up tonight?

ANNE		John? Planning something? There's a new one.

DAVID		Maybe you should give him a call. He'll want to be here.

ANNE		I've tried three times already. He never answers.

ANNE		I'll try again.

SARAH	Really?

FOOTBALL	Hey bro, good game.

BLAKE	Thanks, dude.

FOOTBALL 	Although I think you take this shit a little too seriously, man. It's just street football.

JAMES		That's 'cos we're the best, bro.

FOOTBALL 	You guys are delusional.

BLAKE	Yeah, street football's like our thing. I don't like people running it down like that.

JAMES		He's just jealous, dude. Forget about it.

SARAH	So I take it you guys play alot?

BLAKE	Oh yeah. All the time, we're like umm, backyard champions of L.A.

JAMES		Yeah from Glendale, all the way down to Long Beach.

BLAKE	Past Long Beach, bro. Way past.

JAMES		Yeah we're unstoppable. And John here, he's our secret weapon.

JAMES		Who's on the barbecue? Smells awesome.

BLAKE	He's drunk.

SARAH	Well it's good to have skills.

BLAKE	What, drinking? He's really good at that.

SARAH	No, I mean...

BLAKE	I think it's his life's calling.

BLAKE	I have skills too, by the way.

SARAH	Really? You mean besides running with a ball?

BLAKE	Oh-ho...

SARAH	I'm sorry.

BLAKE	That's fair. Kind of.

SARAH	What other skills do you have?

BLAKE	I fix things.

SARAH	Really? Like what?

BLAKE	Anything. Stuff around the house, plumbing, motorbikes. I just spent a month up at Big Sur helping a guy build a pizza oven.

SARAH	It took a month to build a pizza oven?

BLAKE	Man, this thing was huge, it could fit like five pizzas at once. Plus, I had a lot of surfing to do.

SARAH	Oh, okay.

BLAKE	I'm a busy man.

SARAH	Actually, you know what? I think I might need something fixed.

BLAKE	Really?

SARAH	Yeah, my truck? There's this noise.

BLAKE	Your truck has a noise?

SARAH	Yeah.

BLAKE	I think I should come round some time and take a look at your truck.

SARAH	What are you doing tomorrow?

BLAKE	Well...

JAMES		Is this your phone, dude?

BLAKE	Yeah.

JAMES		It's been ringing all afternoon.

BLAKE	Hello?

SARAH	Hey!

SARAH	Where are you going?

BLAKE	I have to go.  I'll call you tomorrow.

JAMES		He's always doing that.

SARAH	But I didn't give him my number.

JAMES		I'll give you his number.

SARAH	Good. 'Cos I really need my truck fixed.

JAMES		Sure.

GLEESON	Despite what you've seen in the movies, traveling through space is not the same as driving down the I-95, where the speed limit is more of a suggestion than an actual limit.

GLEESON	The speed of light is it. Nothing moves faster. Even at that speed it would take decades to reach even our closest neighbours.

GLEESON	For now we're stuck here, on this rock. Earth.

STUDENT	Boring.

GLEESON	Well let's not forget that this boring little planet is home. It looks pretty small from here, but it holds everything in your life: your family, your friends, everything you've ever known, everything you want to be.

GLEESON	It's all we got. So take care of it. Protect it.

MELISSA	Hey, Tracey!

GLEESON	Hi.

MELISSA	I am so glad this week's over!

GLEESON	What, you actually have weekends?

MELISSA	Mm, I know I should be researching, but it's so hard.

GLEESON	You know Melissa, you don't have to go to every party you're invited to.

MELISSA	I know. Actually speaking of parties, what are your plans this weekend?

GLEESON	Well if you must know, I'm going on a date tonight.

MELISSA	A date! And I thought I was the one having too much fun. Who's the lucky guy?

GLEESON	I ... I kind of met him online. It's probably going to be a total disaster.

MELISSA	Oh no, don't say that. Online dating's totally fine, even normal people are doing it these days.

GLEESON	Wow, you're really filling me with confidence right now, thanks Mel.

MELISSA	Look, if he turns out to be a jerk, I'm having some people over tomorrow, you should totally come. We'll drink champagne, we can laugh about it, and then by mid afternoon, you'll be too drunk to care.

MELISSA	Hello, Earth to Miss Gleeson?

GLEESON	Sorry.

MELISSA	So you're thinking of joining the army now? Seriously?

GLEESON	Lunch, tomorrow, sounds good.

MELISSA	Good, because I've bought this new dress, and I'm not sure but I think I'll wear it. It's just that perfect little cut, it's got this heart shape here...

GLEESON	We should stop for a seismic scan.

MACEY	Yeah we just did, we're running out of time, we need to reach the objective.

GLEESON	Remember what Jackson said, Macey, stealth not speed.

MACEY	Then keep your mouth shut.

ANNE		You want more gravy?

ANNE		Chris?

JACKSON	What?

ANNE		Gravy?

JACKSON	No, thank you.

JENNIFER	Uncle John!

BLAKE	Hey!

DAVID		Hey!

BLAKE	Sorry I'm late. Had a bunch of errands to run.

ANNE		Thanks for coming, John.

BLAKE	It's good to see you, buddy.

DAVID		Give your damn brother a hug, Chris.

BLAKE	It's good to have you back.

JACKSON	Thanks.

BLAKE	I hear you made lieutenant.

BLAKE	I thought you might want these to celebrate.

JACKSON	Thanks, man.

ANNE		Come and eat, John. There's plenty left.

BLAKE	Smells awesome, thanks.

MARGARET	Hey.

ANNE		Chicken, potatoes.

BLAKE	Great.

MARGARET	So have you been keeping yourself busy, John?

BLAKE	Yeah, ever since I came back to LA it's been non-stop. Been fixing up this guy's kitchen for the past week.

DAVID		Plumbing, is it?

BLAKE	Carpentry, mostly. Cabinet doors, benchtops, that kind of thing. He wants to turn the house into a bed and breakfast. You know, one of those internet things.

MARGARET	Internet things?

BLAKE	Yeah. Don't ask me how it works, but a bunch of my friends are doing it.

DAVID		Well it's a great achievement, owning your own home. Something you could aspire to.

BLAKE	Sure, I'll just wait for the 1940s to come back so I can afford one.

DAVID	Well, things aren't what they used to be, but when Margaret and I bought our first home up in Granada Hills there was almost nothing there.

MARGARET	And it was cheap land too.

JACKSON	Excuse me.

DOORPERSON	Good evening. Do you have a booking tonight?

GLEESON	 Yeah, um, I'm with that guy. I think. Sort of?

DOOR PERSON	That's fine. Go on through.

GLEESON	Byron?

BYRON	Yes. Tracey.

GLEESON	That's me.

BYRON	Hi.

GLEESON	Sorry I'm late.

BYRON	No it's fine. Take a seat, please.

GLEESON	So, have you looked at the menu, or...

BYRON	Yeah. It looks good. That's the wine list though.

GLEESON	Of course, right.

WAITER	Good evening, how are you? Can I get you two anything to drink to start off?

GLEESON	Yeah, wine please. Merlot.

WAITER	Sure. Glass?

GLEESON	Bottle.

GLEESON	Did you want something to drink or..?

BYRON	Ah, maybe we could share the merlot.

GLEESON	Great idea. Two glasses, please.

WAITER	Sure.

BYRON	Thank you.

GLEESON	Sorry, I'm nervous.

BYRON	It's fine. Just relax.

GLEESON	I know, I know, I'll be ... I'll be fine. Merlot's coming.

JACKSON	You're not going to bail on me now, are you?

BLAKE	I don't know what you've been through, but ... it's good to have you back, brother.

JACKSON	I'm not back. Not really.

BYRON	Okay, I understand that, but, you know, it's just straight logic. If there are infinite  universes with infinite variations, then somewhere there must be a universe that's just like ours, with a galaxy just like ours, even the same planet Earth. Even the same us, at a restaurant, drinking too much red wine.

GLEESON	Just because it seems logical doesn't make it true. We can't even do tests to find out if there are actually parallel universes.

BYRON	But what about CERN?

GLEESON	CERN hasn't proven anything. It's pointless us even talking about this, we may as well 
      be discussing astrology.

BYRON	Okay, fine. What would you like to talk about then?

GLEESON	I don't know, astrology?

BYRON	You're not enjoying this, are you?

GLEESON	I'm sorry. I'm probably just tired. I spend all day talking about this stuff. To be honest I'm kind of over it. Can we just get the check, please?

BYRON	Sure. Excuse me! Can we get the check please?

ANNOUNCER	The President has promised to continue the mission in northern Africa for as long as it takes to secure peace, despite American casualties now numbering over five thousand. Many soldiers returning from the region will face years of rehabilitation, both physically, and psychologically.

BYRON	Can you believe people are actually signing up to fight in this stupid war? Anyone dumb enough to enlist in the military deserves what's coming to them.

GLEESON	Maybe some things aren't that simple.

BYRON	War is stupid. Seems pretty simple to me.

GLEESON	Can we not talk about this, please?

BYRON	Sure.

GLEESON	Good work.

DREYFUS	Thanks.

GLEESON	That's our objective.

DREYFUS	How are we supposed to get up there?

GLEESON	We'll approach from the northwest. But for now we need a place to hole up for the night. Any idea what those are?

DREYFUS	Old forts from the war. The last one.

GLEESON	Let's check it out.

SARAH	Mai tai?

BLAKE	What?

SARAH	I can't drink both of these myself.

BLAKE	Sure.

BLAKE	Thanks.

SARAH	You're welcome.

BLAKE	Damn it's hot.

SARAH	Yeah.

BLAKE	I think there's a thunderstorm coming though.

SARAH	Yeah I heard thunder.

SARAH	So how's it looking?

BLAKE	It's looking really good.

SARAH	I meant the car.

BLAKE	Oh the car, right um... Yeah it's gonna... it's gonna need a lot of work.

SARAH	Hmm?

BLAKE	Might have to clear my schedule.

RADIO DJ	Dude, I'm sorry I'm gonna have to stop you there. There's a report coming in of some kind of attack in the South Pacific. People are saying a bunch of giant aircraft just appeared out of nowhere. They're like, not from Earth.

RADIO GUEST	What? Wow!

RADIO DJ	Yeah. The president's about to make an announcement.

NEWS ANCHOR	What we're seeing now is video footage recorded just a few hours ago in Manila, where the U.S Navy is engaged in a full scale battle. This is truly astonishing, what we're seeing here. More reports are coming in from all over the South Pacific...

MELISSA	This is crazy.

GLEESON	Parallel universes.

MELISSA	What?

GLEESON	Does anyone have family on the west coast?

MELISSA	I have an aunt in Santa Barbara, but this is happening in the Philippines.

GLEESON	It's just starting. Tell your aunt to head east, as far from the Pacific as possible.

MELISSA	Where are you going?

GLEESON	I think I'm gonna follow my brother.

MELISSA'S G.	But didn't her brother die?

ANNE		I don't care, just any flight heading northeast.

JENNIFER	Mom, mom, what's going on?

ANNE		(overlapping) Toronto if possible.

MARGARET	David, no, carry on luggage only.

JACKSON	Sir, as soon as my family's safe I'll drive straight to Pendleton.

BLAKE	Chris, I can help.

JACKSON	Just a second, sir.

JACKSON	They want me back right away.

BLAKE	I'll get 'em to the airport.

BLAKE	You can trust me.

JACKSON	I'll be there right away, sir.

JACKSON	Goddamn worst timing. Anne's car's in the shop and I need mine to get to the base. Can you take yours?

BLAKE	Yeah. Yeah of course.

JACKSON	I have to go.

ANNE		We've got a flight in two and a half hours. You go, we'll be fine.

JACKSON	Be good for your mom, okay?

DAVID		Watch your back, son.

JACKSON	Always.

BLAKE	Come on, my car's ready.

MARGARET	Why don't you come with us, John? I'm sure there'll be room on the plane.

BLAKE	I'm gonna stay. Help out however I can.

DAVID		You're a good man, John.

BLAKE	Come on, let's get your bags.

BLAKE	Everyone buckled up?

JENNIFER	Yes.

DAVID		You should take better care of your car, John.

BLAKE	Just got it working again yesterday.

ANNE		Come on, John, we're gonna miss the flight.

MARGARET	Perhaps we should call a cab.

BLAKE	No. I know someone who can help.

BLAKE	Yeah I know we've missed the Toronto flight, what I'm asking is if we can get a connecting flight from somewhere else. Take this exit.

SARAH	I know, I've driven to LAX before.

BLAKE	I don't care, anywhere around there will do. Greenland would be fine.

BLAKE	Montreal.

BLAKE	Yeah, yeah, Montreal. Great. Yeah book that in. We're on our way. Thank you.

BLAKE	Hope you all can speak French. You're going to Montreal.

MARGARET	That's wonderful, thank you John.

ANNE		Is it a direct flight?

BLAKE	Stopover in San Fran but it's only an hour. You'll be saying ciao by nightfall.

DAVID		Well that's Italian, John, but thank you nonetheless.

BLAKE	You're welcome.

MARGARET	You're sure you won't come with us?

BLAKE	No, there's something else I gotta do.

BLAKE	Almost. They'll be fine. Chris, I gotta ask you something. I want to enlist, bro. Tell me what I gotta do.

US PRESIDENT	Today, the sun rises on a new chapter in our nation's history, and the history of every nation on Earth. For today, for the first time in over half a century, our world is at war.

COLONEL W	We are both extremely saddened by the death of your family, Lieutenant.

MAJOR ATKINS	We want you to know that Anne, Jennifer and your mother and father, are in the thoughts and prayers of all of us in the 15th MEU.

COLONEL W	We will fight in their honor, and the honor of everyone who was killed in the attack on Los Angeles. I promise, we will not stop until every one of those metal bastards is driven back to wherever the hell they came from.

JACKSON	I'll go wherever I'm needed. I'll fight if I have to.

MAJOR ATKINS	Lieutenant, I...

COLONEL W	(overlapping) Outstanding, Lieutenant. Your resilience in north Africa was inspirational. 

MAJOR ATKINS	What I wanted to say was...

COLONEL W	And we both believe that you would make an excellent platoon leader of the 15th.

JACKSON	I'd be honored, sir.

MAJOR ATKINS	Fortunately, we have some time though. For now the 15th is taking some time to rest, to take stock and recharge. We all need it after the hell we went through over there. We lost a lot of good Marines.

COLONEL W	It was a shitstorm, alright. But we still kicked their asses. And we will do the same again when we take the fight up to these metal bastards across the Pacific.

COLONEL W	But right now, we got a bunch of new recruits heading off to Parris Island for training, and I need someone who can kick 'em into shape before they ship out in 10 weeks. Do you think you can do that?

JACKSON	Certainly, sir.

MAJOR ATKINS	There are counselors on that base there too, Lieutenant. I know nothing well ever make it right. But they can help you cope.

COLONEL W	Hell, there ain't no therapy like screaming your ass off at a bunch of wet knuckleheads, am I right Lieutenant? Look, I need my best men in this fight, Jackson. So you do whatever you gotta do.

MAJOR ATKINS	Go check on your brother. John, right? He's on his way to Parris Island right now.

JACKSON	I have my doubts about him, sir.

COLONEL W	Well, if anyone can make soldiers of these boys, it's you, Lieutenant.

JACKSON	I'll certainly try, sir.

COLONEL W	I know you will.

MAJOR ATKINS	The more we push him, Colonel, the worse it'll be for him when he breaks.

COLONEL W	I'm alright with that, Major. So long as we win.

GLEESON	Is this seat taken?

GLEESON	I'm... I'm Tracey.

BLAKE	Oh, John. You can probably call me Blake.

GLEESON	Oh, right. Surnames.

BLAKE	Yeah.

GLEESON	Yeah, ahh, Gleeson.

BLAKE	So has anyone shouted in your face yet?

GLEESON	No. Does that really happen?

BLAKE	Yeah, I think so.

GLEESON	To be honest, this was kind of a spur of the moment thing. I don't know how I feel about it yet.

BLAKE	Not much we can do about it now.

GLEESON	Yeah. I think that's only just starting to hit me.

JACKSON	What the hell are you knuckleheads doing? Get your asses out here and fall in line. Move! Move! Move!

JACKSON	Stand up straight. Eyes front.

JACKSON	What is your name? Eyes front, goddammit, when I give you an order you will obey! Now what the fuck is your name?

DREYFUS	Dreyfus, sir.

JACKSON	No, it is not.

JACKSON	What is your name? Eyes front, goddammit!

LEWIS		Lewis, sir!

JACKSON	No, it is not.

JACKSON	What is your name?

WILCOX	Wilcox, sir.

JACKSON	Wrong.

JACKSON	What is your name?

GLEESON	Gleeson, sir. It really is Gleeson.

JACKSON	No, it is not.

JACKSON	What is your name?

BLAKE	It's John Blake, really. It's on my driver's license if you want to take a look.

JACKSON	Really? You want to show me your driver's license? Then show it to me.

JACKSON	No? That's right, you can't show me your driver's license, because all your stuff was confiscated before you arrived on this island. So were you just being a smartass, recruit?

JACKSON	Were you being a goddamn smartass?

BLAKE	Yes sir, I was being a smartass, sir.

JACKSON	Get your face on the floor and give me twenty pushups for being a goddamn smartass!

JACKSON	Now, shitbrain!

JACKSON	Does anyone else feel like being a smartass?

JACKSON	No? Good. Because that attitude will get you, the man fighting beside you, and everyone you fight to protect, all dead.

JACKSON	We are at war with an enemy that does not care who you are, or who you think you are. It does not care about honor and glory. It is here to wipe everything you have ever known of the face of the Earth.

JACKSON	Your pride as a Marine, your service to your country, your sacrifice for the greater good, all count for nothing. The only thing standing between the machines and total annihilation of  the human race is your ability to aim your gun and shoot.

JACKSON	You are either a machine killer, or you are dead.

JACKSON	Now, for the last goddamn time. What is your name?

BLAKE	How about machine killer, sir.

JACKSON	Say it like you mean it.

BLAKE	Machine killer, sir!

JACKSON	What is your name?

GLEESON	Machine killer, sir.

JACKSON	What is your name?

WILCOX	Machine killer, sir.

JACKSON	What is your name?

RECRUITS	Machine killer, sir!

JACKSON	Good. Mess hall, five minutes. If you're late, you're out.

BLAKE	Chris.

JACKSON	That's lieutenant, recruit.

BLAKE	Sorry, sir.

JACKSON	You did the right thing by joining up. But my job is to watch over the first wave of new recruits, not pat you on the back.

JACKSON	You work hard, you follow orders.

JACKSON	And don't fuck this up.

PIERCE	Stay calm. Breathe. Your weapon is your ally. Treat it well, and it will protect you. Relax those shoulders, Gleeson. Nice work. Let me ask you a question. Who here has seen an enemy drone? You from Los Angeles? So you know what we're up against?

BLAKE	Yeah I've seen what they can do.

PIERCE	After seeing the horrors that these drones can cause, this man chooses to fight. What will you do? Why don't we find out? Your instinct is right The first thing you do when you see an enemy drone, is hide. You would have been shot. We've been collecting these things ever since they showed up in the South  Pacific. And believe me, we are doing everything we can to figure them out. Lewis. If you can control the things, why aren't we using them against the machines? We've tried. The machines just override our signal. Anything we send into battle ends up being used against our own soldiers. Hell, even our own drones are susceptible to hijacking from the enemy carriers. No. Right now, we are depending on the best, most reliable weapon we have. That's us. Soldiers like you and me. This machine can see you. It can hear you. Hell, it can smell you from miles away. And it is very, very fast But it has a few weaknesses Weakness number one Enemy drones rely on their carrier to recharge. If they get cut off from their carrier, they will go to ground to conserve energy. Finding this out is what saved Los Angeles. Weakness number two. These things are damned heavy. So when they hover, or they jump. they create a distinct seismic pattern which we can detect from up to five miles away using these things. And we call them scan sticks. These will save your life. So use them, often. Alright, let's go, move it out. Well I'll be damned.

DREYFUS	What the hell?

PIERCE	Blake just saved your asses.

JACKSON	You're the only fire team to figure that out on their first attempt. Well done.

JACKSON	You'll probably still die. But you'll die a Marine.

DOCKER	If I die in a combat zone, box me up and ship me home. Pin my medals upon my chest, tell my mama I did my best.

GLEESON	So what's the story, Blake? You and Lieutenant Jackson knew each other before the war, right?

BLAKE	He's my brother.

GLEESON	He's your brother? And you're only telling me this now?

BLAKE	He's kind of a brother.

GLEESON	What does that mean?

BLAKE	My real mom and dad died when I was fifteen. Truck hit 'em on the I-5 and rolled the car.

BLAKE	My family was always close with the Jacksons, so they took me in. Ever since, his family's kind of been my family.

BLAKE	That was until LA got hit. Now it's just me and Chris. We're all that's left.

BLAKE	You know, back in LA, I could barely keep my mouth shut. I could get juiced up about anything, tossing a football, replacing a spark... fixing a cabinet.

BLAKE	Now I just keep seeing their faces after they got out of the car.

BLAKE	I fucked up and now they're gone.

GLEESON	It wasn't your fault, Blake. A lot of people died that day. There was nothing you could do.

BLAKE	I guess that's why we're here though, right? So we can do something.

GLEESON	Yeah I hope so.


GLEESON	My brother was a soldier too.

BLAKE	You never mentioned your brother before.

GLEESON	He was killed in Afghanistan a few years ago.

BLAKE	Damn. I'm sorry.

GLEESON	I was so angry when he joined up. My parents too. Couldn't understand why he did it.

GLEESON	Then he died and...

GLEESON	It kind of changed things for me. I had to try and make sense of it all.

BLAKE	Did you?

GLEESON	Not really. But I'm starting to. It's not about fighting or winning, it's about protecting.

BLAKE	What am I protecting? I've got nothing left.

GLEESON	You got something left, you got us.

DOCKER	One two three four United States Marine Corps... My Corps! Hard core!

MILLER	Down! Down!

BLAKE	Wilcox!

MILLER	Move! Move!

MILLER	Blake! Get your ass over here!

BLAKE	Wilcox.

GLEESON	Blake!

MILLER	Blake!

MILLER	Get those scan sticks in the ground!

MILLER	Come on.

BLAKE	This place is crawling with drones.

MILLER	Tell me something I don't know.

BLAKE	There's a ridge to the northeast where their numbers are thin. We might be able to punch through.

MILLER	Aight, you heard the man, move out.

DOCKER	Move!

MILLER	Y'all try to get some sleep. Goin' be down there at first light.

MILLER	Go! Go! Pop those motherfuckers!

MILLER	Move, move!

DOCKER	Moving!

LEWIS		Down!

MILLER	Move, move!

DREYFUS	Down!

MILLER	Dreadnaught!

DOCKER	Come on, Lewis! Come on!

MILLER	Go, go, go! I got this!

BLAKE	Was fishing part of the mission brief?

BLAKE	I must have missed that part.

BLAKE	What's going on, Chris? Are we waiting for orders?

JACKSON	It's good to see you too, brother. I'm glad you survived.

JACKSON	Can you hear it?

BLAKE	Hear what?

JACKSON	Waves on the beach. Wind in the trees. Call of the birds. Guns have stopped. Battle's over.

BLAKE	What are you saying? We still have our objective. The mission hasn't changed.

JACKSON	There were meant to be two platoons on this island. Now there's just you, me and these knuckleheads. It's not enough.

BLAKE	There might be others.

JACKSON	Scattered, lost, probably dead.

BLAKE	So do we give up? Just wait on the beach until the machines find us?

JACKSON	They've left us alone so far. We're not a threat to them here.

BLAKE	And how long do you think that's gonna last? And even if they do ignore us, what then? Sit on the beach, look at the water while the rest of the world fights?

JACKSON	It's not on you to win the war, John. You don't have to keep fighting because of them.

BLAKE	That's what you think this is about.

BLAKE	I know I screwed up in LA. But the machines killed your family. Not me. I'm here on this island because that's what needs to be done. And I won't stop until it's finished.

JACKSON	You can do whatever you want, brother. But don't fuck this up. We may not have much here but it's ours. And we intend to keep it.

BLAKE	To Wilcox and Miller.

HUTCHINS 	Wilcox and Miller.

DREYFUS	Wilcox and Miller.

DREYFUS	To Gleeson. I hope she gets better soon.

HUTCHINS	Shark One won't be the same without her. Cheers.

DREYFUS	I think I'm gonna get another round.

BLAKE	I got this.

MAJOR ATKINS	Evening, Corporal

BLAKE	Major Atkins, sir.

MAJOR ATKINS	No need for that here, we're both off duty.

MAJOR ATKINS	I'm just here to make sure you boys behave yourselves.

BLAKE	It's just a few drinks, sir. I think we're gonna turn in early.

MAJOR ATKINS	It's not you three I'm worried about.

BLAKE	I guess we all gotta let of steam after Taiwan.

MAJOR ATKINS	You're LA born and raised, right Blake?

BLAKE	Yeah.

MAJOR ATKINS	Have you ever traveled abroad?

BLAKE	Does New Orleans count? Been there a bunch of times.

MAJOR ATKINS	Yeah New Orleans counts. How does it feel being so far from home?

BLAKE	Feels like there's a lot of ocean between us and the Santa Monica Pier. I'm afraid I'll never see my home again, sir.

MAJOR ATKINS	You're a smart man, Corporal Blake, you know what we're up against here. The enemy's built a wall between us and the west coast of America. Until we can find a way to break it, we're stuck here. There's no going home. The 15th will need people like you and Lance Corporal Gleeson to keep it  together. I want you to keep that in mind. Try to keep a clear head.

BLAKE	Thank you, sir. I'll do my best.

MAJOR ATKINS	I know you will, Corporal.

BOUNCER	Sir, you can't come in, you're gonna have to leave.

JACKSON	What the fuck, I'm a goddamn United States Marine.

MAJOR ATKINS	Shit, goddamn Jackson.

BLAKE	Please, sir. Could you let me handle this?

BOUNCER	I understand that, but you're drunk, mate.

MAJOR ATKINS	Fine, go ahead. Just get him outta here.

JACKSON	You better let me through or this won't go well for you. Trust me, I'll fuck you up.

JACKSON	Hey! See? This guy's with me. Shark One Platoon. We're the ones protecting your country, asshole.

BLAKE	(overlapping) Come on Chris, let's get out of here. Come on, come on!

JACKSON	Kids.

JACKSON	I hope you're enjoying the end of the world.

JACKSON	I bet you all raised your glasses, right?

JACKSON	To the brave brothers of the 15th who gave their lives.

JACKSON	I figured a while back it's quicker to drink straight from the bottle. We'd be here all night otherwise.

JACKSON	To the 15th MEU and all the dead whose names I can't remember.

BLAKE	You don't seem to be torn up about it.

JACKSON	That's the advantage of having no hope. It's liberating. You should try it.

BLAKE	So you've just given up? One minor setback, you're ready to surrender?

JACKSON	Setback? We tried to take back Taiwan and we lost the whole of South-East Asia. That's not a setback, it's a fucking catastrophe. And now the north-east is almost lost as well.

JACKSON	The entire 13th MEU gone at Okinawa. Two thousand Marines, dead. I mean how do you replace an entire unit of two thousand Marines?

BLAKE	I knew some people from the 13th. Friends from boot camp. There's no replacing them.

JACKSON	I didn't mean it like that.

BLAKE	The 15th will fight on. We're still strong.

JACKSON	Not that strong. Pretty soon this place is going to get hit too. We can't hold them off. We either bail out, or we die. I don't know where we'll go if we do have to bail out, maybe Antarctica.

BLAKE	I don't want to think like that. I can't.

JACKSON	I get it. Yeah, I get it. Better to die on your feet than live on your knees, right? Yeah well tell that to the guy I saw getting his legs blown off in Fiji. We're fucked.

JACKSON	Oh where are you going?

BLAKE	To visit a friend.

GLEESON	Hey.

BLAKE	Hey. You're awake.

GLEESON	What the fuck?

GLEESON	Where am I?

BLAKE	You're in hospital. We're in Sydney.

GLEESON	Sydney? Shit.

BLAKE	Hey. It's okay. Hey, you're okay. It's okay, it's okay.

BLAKE	She's okay, she just woke up.

NURSE	I'll organise you some breakfast. Try to relax, Miss Gleeson.

BLAKE	Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me.

BLAKE	You're here now. We're safe, okay?

BLAKE	See? Arms. Legs. All intact.

BLAKE	You did real good.

BLAKE	And we got promoted, both of us.

GLEESON	Really?

BLAKE	Yeah. They made you Lance Corporal. For, you know, getting shot, I guess.

BLAKE	That takes balls.

GLEESON	What'd you get?

BLAKE	I got Corporal.

BLAKE	I don't know why. I only got a few cuts and bruises.

GLEESON	No. You deserved it. You got us out of there.

BLAKE	Not everyone.

GLEESON	So when do we ship out?

BLAKE	I sail north with Shark One Platoon in two weeks. We're deploying just outside of Darwin.

BLAKE	But your mission is to get strong, Glees.

BLAKE	And after that, if you want, you can stay right here in Australia.

GLEESON	No.

BLAKE	There's a Marine base here and they need all the smart people they can get. I talked to Jackson, he can get you a position there. They have computers, and science, and all that nerd stuff you like.

GLEESON	No. I want to go back.

BLAKE	Just rest up. Think about it.

MARINE SER	We need these people ready for air transport in half an hour. Can you make that happen?

DOCTOR	Yes, of course.

BLAKE	What's going on?

MARINE SER	They're here. Report to your superior immediately, Corporal.

GLEESON	Blake. What's happening?

BLAKE	They're going to get you out.

BLAKE	Don't worry. Everything is going to be fine.

BLAKE	See you soon.

JACKSON	Thinking of re-joining the fight?

GLEESON	I intend to, sir.

DOCKER	Can you believe I found this chicken just walkin' around?

DOCKER	There's food everywhere here.

DOCKER	You want some?

BLAKE	Hutchins. Are you okay with all this?

HUTCHINS	I don't know, man. Jackson's our C.O.

BLAKE	Yeah, but he's fucking nuts.

DOCKER	Same as the rest of us.

JACKSON	You should wear your uniform, Lewis. You're exposing yourself to the enemy.

LEWIS		How's this for exposing myself?

JACKSON	You see? Total disarray. No-one listens to me anymore.

JACKSON	Damn it's hot.

BLAKE	So was this the plan all along? Find yourself a nice tropical island, go AWOL?

JACKSON	It crossed my mind once or twice. I thought you of all people would understand.

BLAKE	Once, maybe. Not now.

JACKSON	You'll come around.

DREYFUS	Don't shoot.

BLAKE	Dreyfus. Goddammit.

DREYFUS	Is that chicken?

BLAKE	It's good to see you, buddy.

DREYFUS	You too, Corporal Blake.

BLAKE	So what happened? Where did you end up?

DREYFUS	We landed, I don't know, somewhere west of here.

DREYFUS	We lost Lieutenant Macey.

DREYFUS	He kept saying we had to reach the objective. I think he completely lost it.

DREYFUS	Gleeson kept it together though. She was always the smart one.

BLAKE	Gleeson? Gleeson is alive?

DREYFUS	Last time I saw her.

DREYFUS	We got separated up at the ridge. Well, by that I mean I ran away.

DREYFUS	After she went ahead to scout the ridge I scanned five drones heading my way. I had to get out of there.

DREYFUS	I should have stayed, shouldn't I?

DREYFUS	I just got scared, you know? I know we're not supposed to be scared, but I'm always scared.

BLAKE	Could you find your way back?

BLAKE	Hey. Do you think we could go find her?

DREYFUS	I don't know, we ... we got so close to the objective. There were drones everywhere.

BLAKE	That's okay. You know why?

DREYFUS	Why?

BLAKE	We've got this. This is the machine killer.

DREYFUS	This is amazing. Where did you get it?

BLAKE	From a dead alien.

DREYFUS	What does it do?

BLAKE	I don't know. Let's find out.

DREYFUS	What, right now?

BLAKE	Sure. Why not?

DREYFUS	You should be the one to test it.

BLAKE	Keep it.

BLAKE	Leave your backpack. Scan sticks, rifles only. We travel light. 

JACKSON	Hey! Where are you going?

BLAKE	We're going to find Gleeson. She might still be alive.

JACKSON	I told you not to fuck this up, John. You go out there, you're not coming back.

BLAKE	Goddammit, Chris. Whatever happened to never leaving a Marine behind?

JACKSON	They left us all behind. Why can't you see that?

BLAKE	You do whatever you want. I'm still a Marine.

JACKSON	Then you're a fool.

DREYFUS	Hey, Gleeson.

GLEESON	Go. Get some rest.

GLEESON	They're everywhere. They don't seem to care about us.

BLAKE	It's nice here.

GLEESON	Yeah. It's quiet.

GLEESON	I heard about what happened up north.

BLAKE	Yeah. It got pretty hairy for a while.

GLEESON	There's a mission coming up. An important one.

GLEESON	I know you guys have been through a lot.

BLAKE	I know. I heard about it.

GLEESON	Jackson told you?

BLAKE	You want to go?

GLEESON	Honestly, I'm scared. But yeah. Yeah, I want in.

BLAKE	Me too. I'm ready. I think we all are.

BLAKE	I got your back, Glees.

GLEESON	I know.

BLAKE	Clear.

DREYFUS	You said clear!

BLAKE	They were sleeping! Shoot the damn ray gun!

BLAKE	Jesus Christ, it's me!

GLEESON	Blake?

GLEESON	Where have you been?

GLEESON	And you, you bastard, where the hell did you go?

DREYFUS	There were five drones, I panicked.

BLAKE	Shhh. A whole army of drones up that mountain.

BLAKE	Let's go.

BLAKE	Take cover!

GLEESON	What the hell?

JACKSON	I told you not to come back, Blake.

BLAKE	Chris, what the fuck?

JACKSON	Leave, or we'll be forced to take you down!

DREYFUS	Dude, your brother's gone completely sideways.

GLEESON	What should we do?

BLAKE	Okay, so Jackson's at the rear, and they've put themselves in a narrow spot. If we split 'em up, we can narrow the odds.

BLAKE	Dreyfus, keep 'em occupied while Gleeson and I flank 'em. I'll draw Jackson away, you get the drop on the other three. Sound good?

GLEESON	Yeah, I guess. What are you going to do with Jackson?

BLAKE	Let me worry about that.

BLAKE	Ready?

DREYFUS	Ready.

BLAKE	Okay.


GLEESON	Cover me?

BLAKE	Let's move.

DOCKER	Lewis, what the fuck are we doing?

LEWIS		I don't know, man. Let's take a look.

DOCKER	Get down!

GLEESON	Hey! Guns on the ground, both of you.

GLEESON	Dreyfus!

DREYFUS	Hey! You want a taste of this, huh?

DREYFUS	Yeah, that's what I thought.

BLAKE	Jackson!

BLAKE	Stop!

BLAKE	It's over, Chris. We're continuing the mission.

JACKSON	You can't fix this, Blake.

BLAKE	We can if we win. We can make it right.

JACKSON	What's the point? I got nothing left.

BLAKE	We got each other. We're brothers.

JACKSON	I'm not your brother, John. I never was.

BLAKE	No. No!

DOCKER	Get some, Dreyfus!

GLEESON	Hey.

GLEESON	Hey! Snap out of it, you're in command.

BLAKE	Okay.

BLAKE	Run back to the river. Hutchins, Dreyfus, we're holding the rear. Go!

DOCKER	Go, Lewis.

DREYFUS	No!

BLAKE	Go! Go! Go!

DOCKER	Where's Hutchins?

BLAKE	He didn't make it.

DOCKER	Oh, shit.

LEWIS		So what now? There are going to be drones swarming all around us, any minute.

BLAKE	I don't care how many drones there are. We finish the damn mission.

BLAKE	Gleeson, you've seen this thing we're supposed to take out, right?

GLEESON	Well, I haven't seen it, but I know it's there. It's heavily guarded, and we'll have to take down the barrier so I can find a way inside.

BLAKE	No, I'm taking the bomb.

GLEESON	Blake. That's a thermonuclear device on your back. Do you know how to use it? If it fucks up, do you know how to fix it?

GLEESON	Right. So. I'll take it inside. You guys cover me, so that nothing shoots me in the back.

GLEESON	We all knew this was coming.

BLAKE	Fine. Think you can carry this?

GLEESON	I guess I'll have to.

GLEESON	Jesus Christ.

BLAKE	We'll cover you from both sides. You take that thing straight up the center, and drop it in their lap.

GLEESON	Seems simple enough.

BLAKE	You two. You on board? You're going to help us finish this.

DOCKER	Do we have a choice?

BLAKE	No, you don't.

BLAKE	Let's move.

DREYFUS	Are you ready?

BLAKE	Ready. Wait for Docker and Lewis.

LEWIS		Light 'em up.

BLAKE	Now.

BLAKE	Gleeson! Take cover!

DOCKER	So we're breaking radio silence now?

BLAKE	They know we're here. Keep them off Gleeson.

BLAKE	Short bursts. Focus on the rear. Try to thin their numbers. You go that way, I'll go this way. We hit 'em on five.

BLAKE	Back to center.

DREYFUS	You're hit.

BLAKE	Moving positions in three.

BLAKE	Lewis. Docker. What's your status?

BLAKE	Fuck!

DREYFUS	Here, take this. You know what to do.

BLAKE	Dreyfus!

GLEESON	I'm good.

GLEESON	You gotta get clear.

GLEESON	There's no point both of us going down.

BLAKE	I'm not leaving. I'll make sure nothing comes in after you.

GLEESON	Okay, John. Thanks.

BLAKE	Go.

BLAKE	Gleeson! This situation's about to get seriously fucked!

GLEESON	Blake? You should go. I'm fine. We did it.

BLAKE	Set the bomb now!

GLEESON	Blake. You're breaking up.

GLEESON	Oh, right.

COLONEL W	There are no words to express the gratitude felt by our nation for your contribution to the war, Sergeant Blake.

USMC OFF1	The efforts of you and your fellow Marines of the 15th MEU have exposed key weaknesses in the enemy's military apparatus. The United States Armed Forces are now focusing all their efforts on taking out these installations, wherever we find them.

USMC OFF2	Most importantly, you have given us hope again, Sergeant Blake. Your victory on New Britain has shown the world that the enemy can be stopped, and the tide is finally turning in this long and terrible war.

COLONEL W	I understand, we all do, what a great toll a fight like this has on a Marine. And I think I speak on behalf of everyone here, when I say that you've earned a long break from active duty.

USMC OFF1	On your return, we'd like to offer you a post in Pacific Fleet headquarters in Hawaii. I'm sure your first-hand experience of enemy technology will be highly valued there.
USMC OFF2	Mai tais, and surfing? Not a bad ending for a tour of the South Pacific, right Sergeant?

BLAKE	I want to go back.

USMC OFF2	I'm sorry?

BLAKE	To the front line.

BLAKE	It's where I'm needed.
