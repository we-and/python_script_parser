NANCY	The police were asking Barry a lot of questions.

MAN	Previously on The Oval.

NANCY	I think they think he might have something to do with this.

RICHARD	Oh, no.

JASON	I've been reading about this place.  And there's secret passages.

GAYLE	We cannot get out of here.

JASON	Yes, we can.

GAYLE	You do it and I will tell the press corps exactly what happened.

VICTORIA	I really like this.  Where's your dressing room, dear?  (grunting)

DENISE	(grunting)

HUNTER	Has she seen her threat assessment?

DONALD	No, sir, she has not.

HUNTER	Why don't you give it to me, Donald?  (snaps finger) I'll show it to her.

KAREEM	You know you can always talk to me if you need to get something off your chest.

SHARON	I appreciate that.

KAREEM	Hey.  Hey.

SHARON	(sighs) I'm good.  I'm good.

KAREEM	You okay?

SHARON	Yeah, yeah.  I just lost my balance.  (sighs)

KAREEM	All right.  Well, let's take a break.

SHARON	I'm fine.  Okay?

KAREEM	Sharon, come on.  What's with this attitude?

SHARON	I'm not giving you attitude.

KAREEM	I'm not him.

SHARON	You know what, go to hell.

KAREEM	You should save that hostility for your boyfriend.

SHARON	Okay, bastard.  So you wanna play?
KAREEM	More misplaced anger.  Yeah, after I just bought you lunch.

SHARON	Listen, you don't know anything about us, okay?  Nothing.

KAREEM	Okay.  Okay.  Sharon, I'm sorry.  Look, I'm your friend.  I'm, I'm your friend since day one.

SHARON	Friend?

KAREEM	Look, I'm on your side.

SHARON	You just wanna sleep with me.

KAREEM	And?

SHARON	Kareem.

KAREEM	I'm just--and--like it's and I'm your friend.  I'm, I'm a man, Sharon.  I…

SHARON	Who has a woman that just left out of here.

KAREEM	You got--you got a man driving you crazy.  You're falling all over the place.

SHARON	Okay.  Real cute.  (scoffs) Uh-uh.

KAREEM	You think I don't see it every day you come in here, you're, you're not happy.  You're not happy with him.  What's he doing to make you like this?

SHARON	Kareem.

KAREEM	No, no, before you cuss me out, I know you.  I know when you're happy and I know that you had such a light before you met him and he's robbed you of it.  He's taken it.

SHARON	I don't know what you're talking about.

KAREEM	Sharon, no, I know that you love hard.  All right?  Like you loved me.  But I was stupid as hell.

SHARON	I'm glad you know that.

KAREEM	Yeah.  But if I knew then what I know now.

SHARON	It's too late.

KAREEM	Is it?

SHARON	Will you stop?  What are you doing?  Stop.

KAREEM	I'm a better man than I was, Sharon.

SHARON	Look, man.  You have Michelle, right?  Okay?  So will you just drop all this?  I don't even understand why we're having this exchange right now.

KAREEM	It's because I still love you, Sharon.

SHARON	(sighs) Look.  Barry is not perfect.  And I know that, and we have our issues, yes.  But we will figure it, all right?  Barry.
SINGER	Feels like I'm running out of time.  You got to get yours, I got to get mine.  Not really sure where we're headed to.  I just hope that you make it when I do.

BARRY	You talking to this clown about me?

SHARON	No.  No.

BARRY	I heard you.  Don't lie.

SHARON	Look, I, I was just trying to tell him that…

BARRY	Tell him what?

SHARON	(sighs) I just was telling him…

KAREEM	Hey, man.  What's up, Barry?

BARRY	Are you here talking to this clown about me?  Are you gonna tell me the truth or not?

SHARON	No.  I wasn't.  Okay?

KAREEM	We weren't talking about you.

BARRY	I heard you.

KAREEM	Why don't you get your hearing checked?  And there's a free clinic if money's tight.

BARRY	Shut the hell up.

SHARON	Babe.

BARRY	Don't baby me.  Why are you talking to this clown ass negro?

SHARON	Honey, it was nothing.

KAREEM	She was defending you, man.

BARRY	Did I ask you a damn thing?

KAREEM	All right.  You're getting a little hostile, so I need you to leave right now.

BARRY	Why don't you make me?

KAREEM	Sharon, please get him out of here.

BARRY	You get me out of here.

SHARON	Barry, stop it, okay?

CUSTOMER	Should I call the police?

KAREEM	Yes, yes, miss.  Please call the police.

SHARON	No.  We're fine.  We're fine.  Please, just leave, babe.

BARRY	Why are you talking about me, Sharon?

SHARON	It was nothing.

BARRY	It didn't sound like nothing.

KAREEM	It was nothing because we were talking about you.

BARRY	You wanna say something else?

KAREEM	Sharon, please.

BARRY	Shut the hell up.

KAREEM	Please get your man checked.

SHARON	Honey, all right.  Stop.  I'm at work.

BARRY	Not anymore.  I didn't want you in this damn job anyway.  She quits.

SHARON	No, I don't.

BARRY	Yes.  Yes, you do.  You are coming home.

SHARON	No, I'm not leaving with you.

BARRY	Sharon, you are coming now.

SHARON	I'm not coming with you.  Stop acting like--no.  Please stop.  Barry.

BARRY	Sharon, I will drag your ass out of here.

KAREEM	Sharon.

BARRY	I'm gonna…

KAREEM	Barry, let go.

SHARON	Get off of me.

KAREEM	Let go of her, Barry.  Go.

SHARON	Stop.  You're hurting my arm.  What are you doing?

BARRY	(grunting)

SHARON	Stop it.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Oh my God.  Stop.  Get off of him.  (groans)

KAREEM	Are you okay?

BARRY	Get out of here, yo.  Come on.

KAREEM	Man, you did that.  Get your…

BARRY	Shut the hell up.  I had it with you.  I'll beat your ass again.  Move.  Sharon, let's go.

SHARON	no.

BARRY	Let's go.

SHARON	No, I'm not going anywhere with you.

BARRY	Sharon, I'm telling you right now.  Let's go.

SHARON	No.

BARRY	I'm telling you right now.  We are going home.

SHARON	Or what?  Don't you dare give me no damn ultimatum, all right?

BARRY	If you don't come home with me now, do not come home at all.

SHARON	You really wanna do this?

BARRY	You heard what I said.

SHARON	I'm not going.  (sighs)

KAREEM	Look at my damn store.

GAYLE	Get out.

JASON	You feeling better?

GAYLE	Jason, get out of my room.

JASON	What would you give me if I could get you out of here?

GAYLE	Okay.  You can't.

JASON	I can.

GAYLE	Jason, get out of my room.

JASON	You sure?

GAYLE	If I wasn't sure, I wouldn't have said it.

JASON	Okay.  Your loss.

GAYLE	Bye.

JASON	I mean I just a found way out where no one would know you were gone.

GAYLE	They're watching us like lab rats.

JASON	Yeah?  They are?

GAYLE	So we can't go anywhere.

JASON	Look, I can tell you but, uh, it's gonna cost you.

GAYLE	(sighs) Bye, Jason.

JASON	Look, what do you have to offer?

GAYLE	Whatever I have doesn't matter because I'm not paying you because you can't get me out of here.

JASON	Okay.  Look, they think they're so smart and such tough guys.  How crazy would it be to be able to sneak out of here?

GAYLE	Bye, creep.

JASON	Come on.  Don't you wanna show them that we're better?

GAYLE	Then you go, Jason.

JASON	I don't have anywhere I wanna go.  But you do.  Look, I saw his page.  I know he's with her.  If you do exactly what I say, no one will know.  All we need is for mom and dad to have one of those epic fights, right?  That's the distraction we need to get you out of here.  Come on.  I'll show you.  You can see Picky.

GAYLE	Fine.

PRISCILLA	Hey.

PRISCILLA	No, but it may make you feel better.

RICHARD	What's that?

PRISCILLA	The First Lady tased that girl.

RICHARD	What?

PRISCILLA	(chuckles) It's the craziest shit I've ever seen.

RICHARD	(laughs) What are you saying?

PRISCILLA	That girl was trying to leave through the front door and the First Lady tased her ass.

RICHARD	What?

PRISCILLA	(laughs) Yes.  I'm telling you.

RICHARD	(laughs) Seriously?

PRISCILLA	I mean, I felt bad for her but that's what her lying ass get.

RICHARD	Yeah.  I don't know.

PRISCILLA	What?

RICHARD	I don't know if I wanna go back in that place.

PRISCILLA	Yes, you do.

RICHARD	Priscilla, I'm serious.

PRISCILLA	Don't let these people stop you from doing what you love.  I'm not gonna let them do it.

RICHARD	Yeah.

PRISCILLA	And I don't want you to either.

RICHARD	But these…

PRISCILLA	No, no buts.  No buts.  There are plenty of folks that we didn't like in the White House but we made it through.

RICHARD	Baby, you need to stay calm.

NANCY	Who?  Tell me.

RICHARD	The President's daughter said that Barry raped her.

NANCY	What are you telling me?

RICHARD	It's not true.

NANCY	I know.  I know it's not true but what are they saying about my son?

PRISCILLA	Okay.  Sam is gonna get the proof that it's not true and he's gonna give it to them and Richard is going to et his job back.

NANCY	This ain't making no sense.

RICHARD	(sighs)

PRISCILLA	Okay.  We got it, Nancy.

RICHARD	Baby, look, we are gonna handle this.

PRISCILLA	Uh-hmm.

NANCY	I, I, I just got to go and pray.  No.  This is out of hand.

RICHARD	Trust me.

NANCY	This is--this is just out of hand.

RICHARD	I told you not to tell her.

PRISCILLA	You told her.

RICHARD	But do you see how upset she gets?

PRISCILLA	I know.  I'm so sorry.  Is there anything else I can do?

RICHARD	(sighs) No.  Uh, I'll call you.

DONALD	So, with the EPA doing the investigation, we run the risk of not getting the bill pushed through in time, so I hink that would…

HUNTER	Oh, let someone else do it.

HUNTER	Who has the last word on this?

DONALD	You do, sir.

HUNTER	And I think I just gave it to you.

HUNTER	(chortles) You think I'm yours?

VICTORIA	I'm not talking about you.  I don't give a shit about you.  I'm talking about this Oval.

SHARON	This is crazy.  (sighs)

SHARON	Ms. Nancy, this is Sharon.  Please give me a callback, okay?

DONALD	So how was it really?

LILLY	Strange.

DONALD	How so?

LILLY	She's just strange.  That's all.  So did you get any info on the intruder?

DONALD	You know what?  I was just about to look at it.

LILLY	Can I?

DONALD	Yeah.  It's somewhere here in my desk, but why?

LILLY	Well, Donald, I shot a man.  I just wanna know.

DONALD	Well, he's a former Army Ranger.  He did four tours.  He has no wife, no kids.  He lived in a halfway house in Virginia, go figure.  (scoffs) He's got a CDL license.  That's all we know for now, but I'm sure we'll know more in a few hours.

LILLY	Is he okay?

DONALD	You know what?  I really don't wanna talk about this again.

LILLY	Okay.

DONALD	Wait.  You didn't tell her about this, did you?

LILLY	Okay.

DONALD	(groans)

LILLY	(gasps) Kyle.

KYLE	Hello.

LILLY	Hi.

KYLE	I was just on my way to see your husband.

LILLY	Oh, is everything all right?

KYLE	Yes.  Everything's fine.

LILLY	Good.

KYLE	And how are you?  Are you doing okay?

LILLY	Well, to be honest, I'm very concerned about the intruder from last night.

KYLE	I understand that.  I can only imagine.

LILLY	Can we talk?

KYLE	Yeah, of course.  Uh, but not here, I'll give you a call in a bit.

LILLY	Yes.

KYLE	Okay.

LILLY	Thank you.

KYLE	Yeah.

DONALD	Come in.

KYLE	Sir.

DONALD	No, no, no.  Get out.

KYLE	I just wanna talk to you, sir.

DONALD	I just said leave.

KYLE	This is about you replacing me, sir.

DONALD	Kyle…

KYLE	I'm very good at my job.

DONALD	No, we are not a fit.

KYLE	Oh, I think we're a great fit.

DONALD	Kyle…(sighs)

KYLE	Sir, you can't do this.

DONALD	What--what--what is wrong with you, huh?

KYLE	I just wanna do my job.

DONALD	Okay.  Then do it with a cabinet member.

KYLE	I want you.  I want you.

DONALD	Are we still talking about the job?

KYLE	(sniffles)

DONALD	Kyle, I've told you before, and I'm not gonna say it again, especially not in this place.

KYLE	(sniffles) Yes, sir.

DONALD	Okay.  Now leave my office and do not come back.  You understand that?

KYLE	Yes, sir.

DONALD	Thank you.  (sighs) (exhales deeply)

JASON	She's coming.

GAYLE	Oh.

GAYLE	(groans)

HUNTER	What happened?

GAYLE	Mom tased me.

HUNTER	What?

GAYLE	Yeah.

HUNTER	What are you talking about?

GAYLE	She tased me.

HUNTER	How?

JASON	She took the taser from the Secret Service and she just tased her.

HUNTER	Are you kidding me?

GAYLE	(gasping) No.

HUNTER	When?

JASON	Uh, this morning.

GAYLE	(groans)

HUNTER	Where?

GAYLE	In the entry hallway.

HUNTER	(sucks teeth) Did anybody see this?

GAYLE	(groans) Some of the staff.

JASON	It--it was bad, dad.	

GAYLE	(groaning)

HUNTER	Where is your mother?

JASON	In your room.

GAYLE & JASON	(chuckle)

HUNTER	Have you lost your mind?

VICTORIA	I'll call you back.

HUNTER	Have you?

VICTORIA	Yes, the day I married you.

HUNTER	Did you tase Gayle?

VICTORIA	Like she was a black man on the streets.

HUNTER	What the hell is wrong with you?

VICTORIA	Oh really?  You care?

HUNTER	Of course I care.

VICTORIA	Since when?

HUNTER	She's my daughter.

VICTORIA	Yeah, and she's been that for the past 16 years.  Only I've been the only one that's had to put up with it.

HUNTER	Oh, don't give me that.

VICTORIA	Oh, no, I damn well will.  You deal with the attitude and the teenage bullshit and see if you won't tase her ass yourself.  I'm sick of it.

HUNTER	Wow.  You really are a cold-hearted bitch.

VICTORIA	And a deadly one.  Do you wanna try me?

HUNTER	No.  No, no, no.  That's--that's not what I said.  But, uh, it's true.  That's what your threat assessment said.

VICTORIA	What are you talking about?

HUNTER	America, yeah, they hate you.  They think you're cold, and snotty, and a brat, but mostly just a straight-up bitch.  Wait here.  Read it for yourself, come on, no?  Okay.  This guy wants to rape you.  This guy wants to eat your skin.  And this guy wants to feed you your own skin.  Ooh.

VICTORIA	Sounds better than anything you've ever done.

HUNTER	Well, I don't know.  Denise loved it.

VICTORIA	Not anymore.

HUNTER	Good luck with that.  Come on, read it.

VICTORIA	Hunter.

HUNTER	I wanna watch you read it.

VICTORIA	Get away from me.
