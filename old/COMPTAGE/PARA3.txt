(PARADISE HILLS 3)


UMA	Holy shit.

AMARNA	That's what he really came to do.

UMA	How?

AMARNA	Uma, there's no stalker. It was all a front. My admirer stashed the rowboat here and sailed around the island all night... but nobody spotted him till dawn. They're not guarding the coast at night. That's our way outta here. We come here after dinner, we get on the rowboat, and we go to shore. It's only 10 miles. We can do it. Uma! Please.

UMA	I thought you didn't want to leave at all. What's changed?

AMARNA	Last night I was able to stay awake for the first time since we've been here. You know why? 'Cause I didn't drink the milk. They've been drugging us every night. They make us sleep like we're dead. But the Residence isn't sleeping.

UMA	Where did you find this?

AMARNA	It was in the patio, by the mermaid. There was staff that I didn't even recognize...wheeling passed-out girls around.

UMA	What?

AMARNA	Listen, we have to go. Tonight. We don't drink our milk, and we meet here after curfew.

UMA	I have to tell Markus.

AMARNA	No, Uma, you can't.

UMA	I can't disappear on him again.

AMARNA	Okay. Just don't give him any details.

MARKUS	Listen. They're gonna transfer me to the cargo crew tomorrow. We'll be out of here in a couple of weeks, maybe less. Wow, don't get too excited.

UMA	I am. It's just...

MARKUS	What?

UMA	I have to tell you something.

FAVORITE 1	Mesdemoiselles, your attention, please. Once in a blue moon... a resident is so receptive to what we offer... that she's ready to rejoin her loved ones sooner than expected. And so it is with our own... Amarna.

FAVORITE 2	We shouldn't be sad to see her leave us this evening. We should instead let our hearts swell with joy... at the strong young woman Amarna has become during her time here. To Amarna.

AMARNA	Uma. Uma. Listen to me, okay? You take that boat with Markus. It's yours.

UMA	But how will I find you? What?

AMARNA	Hey. You promise, right?

UMA	I promise.

AMARNA	I'll see you there, okay?

ASSISTANT 1	Amarna! Time to go.

AMARNA	Yeah, I'm coming. Be safe.

YOUNG NURSE	They should be grateful.

YOUNG NURSE	Yeah?

OLD NURSE	Yeah. Isn't this ugly?

YOUNG NURSE	What the hell? How did she get all the way over here?

OLD NURSE	The sedative's slow sometimes. It hits them on the way to the bathroom.

YOUNG NURSE	We taking her to the OR?

OLD NURSE	No, it's not her turn tonight.

CHLOE	What's up with you?

UMA	I'm fine.

CHLOE	Yeah? 'Cause you're scaring the mirror.

UMA	I just had weird dreams last night.

CHLOE	Really? I ain't never had a dream here.

FEMALE ANCHOR	The beloved artisan apparently took his own life last night...financially ruined by the hostile takeover of his family-owned business.

MALE ANCHOR	...Son Hingston orchestrated the purchase...

UMA	Stop!

MALE ANCHOR	...and removed Mr. Stowe...

UMA	Turn it off!


MALE ANCHOR	...after a lengthy and costly legal battle.

UMA	Turn it off!

FEMALE ANCHOR	Mr. Hingston fired the staff...and automated the factory.

MALE INTERVIEWER	Son, what about Mr. Stowe's widow and daughter?

UMA	Let me down!

MALE INTERVIEWER	Don't you care what happens to them?

SON	Of course. I've made the necessary arrangements.

UMA	Let me out of here!

MALE INTERVIEWER	Son, can you give us anything more?

FEMALE ANCHOR	Some could say...

UMA	Let me down!

FEMALE ANCHOR	...you've ruined the Stowe legacy.

UMA	Turn if off!

FEMALE ANCHOR	How do you respond?

UMA	This place is a fucking lie! What are you doing to us? What are you doing to us?

TECHNICIAN 1	Wait!

ASSISTANT 1	Mademoiselle, stop!

UMA	No, stop it! You're lying to us! Why are you lying?

TECHNICIAN 1	Mademoiselle, be still!

YU	Uma!

UMA	Why are you lying?

YU	Where are you taking her?

UMA	Yu!

TECHNICIAN 2	We don't wish to hurt you, mademoiselle.

UMA	Please! Markus! Help me!

FAVORITE 1	Easy, Uma.

FAVORITE 2	Sit. Finish it.

DUCHESS	Why don't you drink me?

FAVORITE 1	Good morning, Uma.

UMA	What's going on? What? No, no, no! Let me go!

MALE JOURNALIST	How about a kiss? Yeah, give us a kiss, come on!

DUCHESS	Well... isn't that a pickle? You think this place is a lie? Look at your friend. Her treatment seems rather effective in the end, don't you think? I think both her label and her family will be very, very pleased with the result. You gotta see this. This is what Son paid... to have you skip our waiting list. Do you think he would spend so much money on something that doesn't work? Understand this. The therapy is real. You're just a prickly little pear. And now, you're done.

UMA	What are you talking about?

DUCHESS	We're nearly finished with you, Uma. By tomorrow, you'll be able to leave here forever.

UMA	Tomorrow?

DUCHESS	Frankly, I thought you'd be happier. I was under the impression you couldn't wait to go.

UMA	How long have I been asleep?

DUCHESS	How long have you been asleep? One... No, two weeks. Run along now, little bug. Your friends miss you.

CHLOE	Sure you're okay?

UMA	Yes.

YU	They told us you went nuts... that you broke that dumb horse. Is that true?

UMA	Okay, look, forget about all of that.

UMA	The Amarna we said goodbye to is not the Amarna I saw on TV. They did something to her. And I'm not waiting around for them to do it to me. I'm leaving... and I want you two to come with me.

CHLOE	How?

UMA	Tonight. We throw up our milk, we sneak out of the Residence... and we row this fricking boat to the mainland.

YU	And then what? I can't go home until I'm cured. My aunt and uncle will throw me out.

UMA	So don't go home.

CHLOE	What do you mean?

UMA	I know somewhere else. Somewhere safe. Look, our families sent us here to shape us in their image. Not ours. I'm not doing it. Are you with me?

CHLOE	Screw 'em.

UMA	Come with us.

YU	I can't.

CHLOE	It's okay. But we'll be waiting for you tonight if you change your mind.

UMA	Yeah.

MARKUS	It's my fault. I should've tried to join the crew sooner...

UMA	It's only three more days.

MARKUS	Listen, I will be on the next plane out next week. I'll meet you on the mainland... and I swear, I will never let anything tear us apart again.

UMA	Okay.

MARKUS	Yeah?

UMA	I'll wait for you.

WAITER ASSISTANT	Mademoiselle, finish your dinner, please.

CHLOE	I gotta take a leak.

UMA	Yu!

YU	I'm not the one that needs to change.
