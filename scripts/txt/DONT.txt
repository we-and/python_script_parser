(CHARACTER)	(DIALOGUE)

(10:00:27:00)	
ALERO	So while unfaithfulness may not destroy a marriage, but it will certainly break the trust you had, and that is the strength of the marriage. My husband can call me at 9pm and tell me that he wants to hang out with his friends, I will not have a problem with it, that is because he has never cheated, or at least I have never caught him, but the day I do, I will not throw him out, but things will never be the same. Yes Emeka,
		
(10:00:59:00)	
EMEKA 	if we spent some time with someone else that you like a whole lot and nothing physical, is that ehhhh considered unfaithfulness or something?
	
		
(10:01:10:00)	
ALERO	<smiles> Emeka in your heart I am sure you know the answer to that, let your conscience judge you. Ok so today we talked on unfaithfulness and trust, next week we will talk about forgiveness right?good   <laughs>

You know what advertisers do? They sell it to us everyday a beautifull and desireable home but on a closer look<glops sliava> is a perrty home with no one there, there is no stability, no love, no intergrity, is a package full of lies and deceits and when you make efforts to make it work<sobs> am sorry I just<sobs>

DR KENNY	What has been diagnosed is called conversion disorder

(10:05:34:00)
FRED	Convertion disorder ?
(10:04:3:00)
ALERO	Yes is emmm is a condition also known as hysterical vain anises
(10:04:39:00)
DR KENNY	Histerical thymuses
(10:04:43:00)
FRED	Emmmm what is that ?
(10:04:37:00)
DR KENNY	It is mainly sociological and it is mainly caused by a reaction to a trumathic situation what it simply means is that you experience some form of thruma during the accident my guess is that you were expecting to be blinded by a object in the car and your eyes translated that message to your brain which in trurn translated the information back to your eyes
(10:06:13:00)
FRED	So what you are saying in expense now doctor is that my blindness is merely  sociological ?
(10:06:19:00)
DR KENNY	Exactly as crazy as it sounds yes that is what it is
(10:06:24:00)
FRED	But how can that be ? are you sure you know what you are talking about doctor ? because all i see is total black and yet she sits there and says my blindness is merely sociological
(10:06:36:00)
DR KENNY	Yes that is what the report says
(10:06:39:00)
ALERO	Emmm doctor how long will it take ?
(10:06:45:00)
DR KENNY	As to how long it will take i am not sure it could be from six months to two years but he does stand a chance
(10:06:57:00)
