Hendrik	Hello, Malusi. Are you done?

Moses	Listen, I think Thabang is coming for you.

Hendrik	What? Is he coming here?

Moses	Yes. He's driving in your direction. I saw him at a roadblock.

Hendrik	Thabang is on his way here.

Katlego	Don't even think about it.

Junior	It was an accident. Please. Let's talk like men.

Thabang	Now you want to talk like men? Did you give my mother that chance?

Sindi	Breathe! Breathe! Everything will be fine. Hold on!

Mbali	Nothing will be fine! We’re going to die. And frankly, we deserve it!

Sindi	Your father and brother have got this. Here he is!

Hendrik	Stay here! Don't move!

Sindi	I told you that your father has got this.

Hendrik	I've handled it.

Mbali	Thabang?

Hendrik	Yes. Thabang is dead because he tried to play a weak hero! I shot him. What do you mean? I killed him! That's what I mean. He came here and tried to bully me! Stupid boy!

Sindi	You did very well, my dear. What choice did he have? He had to kill him.

Junior	There's more than R10 million in those bags. We can't leave it.

Hendrik	What am I supposed to do with it? - Go and get it! - Why don't you get it? Your boy is such a fool! Listen here, lock the car.

Sindi	Close, close. Quiet.

Minister of Police	Yes? What? Tell me you're joking, Katlego. Okay. Keep me posted. It was Katlego.

Cassius	What? What happened?

Minister of Police	There’s been another attempt on the President's life.

Cassius	Oh, the second one?

Minister of Police	Luckily, they caught Moses before he could do it.

Cassius	Yoh! This Katlego of yours is relentless!

Minister of Police	Yeah, yeah. Look, Deputy, now that we have Moses in custody, we'll find out more about this plot.

Cassius	Yes, yes. Don't forget that we're still looking for Zondo. That case is still open.

Minister of Police	Okay.

News Anchor	Good afternoon, from the NNC studios in Randburg. My name is Cathy Mohlahlana. We continue tracking the day's big developments… South Africans reacting with enormous relief to the announcements that … President Mulaudzi is in a stable condition after undergoing emergency surgery…It's understood that Muluadzi is talking with advisors and has been updated on the unfolding situation altough it's not expected that she will return to work for the next few days Now, Deputy President, Ndlovu, is spearheading the effort...to track down Hendrik Zondo.

Katlego	We've got Moses secured in another ward. As soon as I leave here, I'll go and question him.

President Mulaudzi	Thank you. All along, I've been telling myself that Moses is trying to kill me because he hates me. 	There's more to it. This is more than just hate. Someone has promised him something big, if he brought my head on a silver platter. The question is, who?

Katlego	I’ve been thinking about it. Madam President, I suspect the Deputy President.

President Mulaudzi	No, no!

Katlego	He's the only person who stands to gain the most from your death.

President Mulaudzi	Oh, please! Don’t be ridiculous!

Katlego	Why?

President Mulaudzi	Leave Cassius out of this. He'd never do that.

Katlego	Madam President, if you die, he becomes the President of this country.

President Mulaudzi	No. Not Cassius. I know him.

Katlego	Who is it, then? Because Hendrik...has taken the money, and is trying to skip the country. And he has nothing to gain...from your death.

President Mulaudzi	I know. Someone definitely wants me dead. And that person is within the cabinet. Find them!

Katlego	We'll find them. We will find them. What are you doing, Madam President?

President Mulaudzi	Getting out of this place.

Katlego	You can't go to the Union Buildings. You've been hurt. The doctors said three days rest.

President Mulaudzi	Three days, Katlego? You can take it. Do you want it? I'm done lying here. I'm going to the Union Buildings. You go and talk to Moses. Interrogate him until he tells you exactly what's going on! As for me, I'll go and find this mole...and deal with him. Call the nurse to come and help me change.

Thabang	A dead man. Trying to kill a dead man.

News Anchor	Speculation on social media has been rife as the #WhereIsTheMoney?... has been trending  nationally for the last hour.

Katlego	Get out.

Moses	Comrade.

Katlego	You...are going to tell me the truth.

Moses	So...do you have the rights to interrogate me? Wow! Things have changed since apartheid.

Katlego	I just want one thing from you. The truth. Where's Hendrik?

Moses	Tell me, how much do you make a month? R18K?

Katlego	I'll damage you. I'll damage you. Do you hear me? You think...you can attempt to take the President's life twice, and get away with it? Hm?

Moses	Don't be shy, bra. I mean, it's even embarrassing to say... how much you take home per month. Knowledge is power, my brother. Let's say...R20K. No, I'm sure it's less than that because there's medical aid, tax deductions, and all the other nonsense. Maybe...you take home around R13-14K.

Katlego	Are you done? Are you done? Tell the truth, bloody dog! Do you hear me? Where is Hendrik? I'm not playing games with you!

Moses	My brother, I can help you. Think about it. I mean, just today, how much would you have made? I mean, all your sacrifices, and the risks you've taken.You know...today only,- how much would you have made? - Get lost!

Katlego	Where's Hendrik?

Moses	You can kill me, man. But all the injustices in South Africa, will not end. Those so-called leaders whom you're prepared to die for, don’t care about you. We, soldiers, are their doormats. We leave early in the mornings and risk leaving our children fatherless, for what? Peanuts? Monkeys' food. I could set you up. I could make you happy. I could give you R10 million. Ten million rands. Do away with poverty...and let your children enjoy bacon and eggs. What do you say, Sir?

Hendrik	Hurry up, hurry up. Why are you walking like an elderly woman? Listen, here is something important I must tell you. I need you to be on the ball. Do you hear me?

Junior	Yes, I hear you.

Hendrik	I want you to drive the cash truck. - Do you hear me? - Yes. I hear you, Gumede.

Thabang	Greetings, Zondos! Aren't you forgetting something? You can't just leave me alone.

Junior	How come he's not dead?

Hendrik	Listen, Don't think that...blowing that bomb up  will only kill us and not you.

Thabang	I know. And you know what, that would be perfect. Zondo, you and I have committed terrible crimes. Both of us...are corrupt. Finally, we can all die for our sins together. Do you hear me?

Mbali	Thabang. You're alive!

Hendrik	Hey! Shut up! Do you want to lose your unborn baby? Listen, Thabang. Do you think that bomb...will only kill us and not you?

Thabang	After everything you've done? Huh?

Hendrik	Listen, Thabang. Listen to me very carefully. Please...forgive me for everything I have done to you. All I've ever done to hurt you, please forgive me today. Whatever you're thinking of doing, think of the unborn baby. If it comes in this  world without a father, it will have no one to raise it. Do you get my point, Thabang? Your whole life could change, Thabang. All your sufferings could end. There's money in that van. A lot of money. R1.2 billion. I could give you R100 million. In cash. You could walk out of here with it and change your life. Start your life afresh and forget we ever met. Think about it, Thabang. Think about the baby. Think about that little baby. Your baby. Who could grow up without a father. Do you understand what I'm saying? You and I are not enemies. Everything we do is in effort to give our families a better life. You know that, Thabang. You know that, right? Think about it very carefully. Thabang.

Sindi	Help me, Lord! The money! Oh, Lord! Help me, Lord! Help me, Father! Oh! So much money, Lord!

Cassius	Why haven't your people  captured Zondo yet? Hm? What exactly are they doing?

Minister of Police	We'll catch him.

Cassius	When? Every minute you don’t find him, amounts to more damage! Is there any resource we haven't given you, that you need? Huh? Anything else? You've got wire-tapping, satellites...and soldiers! You even have military, but still no results! - Don't just gawp at me. Speak! - Sir,

Minister of Police	this is the first time we're dealing with such a situation in this country! - We're doing our best! - Your best?

Cassius	Your best? This is South Africa! We're the beacon of hope for the African continent! And all you have to tell me is "we're doing our best."

Minister of Police	Sir, I don’t know how to say it. I said my people on the ground are doing everything...

Cassius	Hey! Get lost! Don't talk to me as if I'm a child! Yes? When? Okay, thank you for informing me. Great news. Our President is on her way here.

Minister of Police	Yes!

Hendrik	You're messing with me, rubbish! Huh! You're messing with me! I helped you, fed you and treated you like my son... and this is the thanks I get? I'm going to kill you, bastard! Is this the thanks I get? Huh? You're full of nonsense! After I looked after you and treated you like my own son? You even slept with my daughter and made her pregnant, rubbish! I'll kill you! Hello?

Cassius	We need to talk.

Hendrik	Listen, I can't talk right now.

Cassius	Hey! We need to talk now!

Hendrik	Listen, I'm still chasing some bastard here.

Cassius	Listen here, I want to know why Lufuno is still alive and on her way here!

Hendrik	Listen, Cassius, someone tried to kill me with a grenade. I'll call you back.

Cassius	Hello!

Mbali	No, Ma. This is wrong. There is no need to kill Thabang. His family needs him!

Sindi	Thabang is our enemy.

Mbali	No, he's not. He loves me. If he was our enemy, he would have blown us up.

Sindi	Open your eyes, my child. Just because you're carrying his baby doesn't mean he loves us. He blew up our truck  because he wanted us to suffer. Look where we are now.

Mbali	That's because Dad shot him, trying to kill him.

Sindi	When he got arrested, he sold us out. If he hadn't done that, we would have helped him out of that mess.

Mbali	So you’re blaming Dad’s corruption on him?

Sindi	Thabang is no saint. When he got arrested, he sold us out. If he hadn't done that, we'd have helped him. Look where we are now. Your father is no saint either, but he is honest. Thabang on the other hand, ate from your father's table, and got full. And what did he do next? He turned his back on us. All those people died  because of him. All your father ever wanted was to go back home on a pension, raise cattle and give back to the poor... with the money Thabang burnt. Look how many lives he's destroyed now. But that doesn't matter anymore, my love. We still have that R10 million your brother took from the dogs. We can use it to go to Abu Dhabi, enjoy life, and forget all of this ever happened. This whole thing will pass.

Mbali	Yes, Ma.

Thabang	Bridge.

Bridget	Thabang. Thabang, where are you? Are those gunshots?

Thabang	I’m fine. But not for long. I need you to listen to me, Bridge. Listen, I’m not going to make it out of this.

Bridget	No. No, no. Please don't say that.

Thabang	Listen, listen, please. All I ever did was my best. And all I ever gave was my best. I know it was not even near enough, but it was the best I could give. I'm sorry. I want you and Didi to know that...I'll always love you.

Bridget	Thabang. Thabang, please don't give up. Please, babe. I need you.

Thabang	Don't worry, Bridge. You’re strong, and because Didi has you as her mother, I know she'll be fine. Bridge, you’re a warrior.

Bridget	Thabang...Thabang!

News Anchor	This has just come in from sources closest to the President… It's understood that President Mulaudzi has ignored medical advice and returned to the Union Buildings to resume her duty...as President. Our sources are telling us today that...she's not happy with the efforts to recapture Hendrik Zondo...who remains at large.

Cassius	Oh! Madam President. Welcome, welcome. Welcome.

President Mulaudzi	Thank you. This is no time for applause. We should all be out there looking for Zondo. R1.2 billion is gone. We need to find him, okay? Minister, please fill me in on what’s happening on the ground.

Minister of Police	Yes, Madam President. We've shut down all the ports for in and out of the country. The railways, airports and  bus stations. All of them. We’ve also set up a tip-off line, to monitor communications.

President Mulaudzi	Good. We need to utilise every way possible to catch that criminal. Thank you, Comrades.

Cassius	Thank you, Ministers. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey. I'm so glad you're back safely. I was so scared. Oh, Lord! I'm sure you've had the worst day ever.

President Mulaudzi	You know, I still can't believe I'm standing here. I was so scared.

Cassius	Mm.

President Mulaudzi	A lot. I’m not ready to die. Not yet, not today, not now.

Cassius	Don't be scared. Don't be scared, you're safe now. I'm here to protect you. Nothing can ever harm you again, okay? I love you.

President Mulaudzi	- I love you too. - I love you. Ouch!

Cassius	Oh, sorry, sorry. I love you.

President Mulaudzi	I love you too.

Cassius	Okay. Come here.

Hendrik	Junior! I think he's out of bullets.

Junior	Yes, they're finished.

Hendrik	- Should we go for him? - Let's go.

Sindi	What happened, dear? Have you found him?

Hendrik	No, the police have surrounded this whole place. - Where are the car keys? - It's because of what we did!

Mbali	People died on us today! Money was stolen from the country! This is not normal!

Sindi	- Give the keys! - People will see you for what you are!

Mbali	I'd be very happy to raise my child from prison.

Sindi	- Goodness! - Than to be stuck in hell with you guys.

Mbali	In Dubai.

Hendrik	- Hey, listen! - Let's go! Give the car keys, we want to go! Give the keys! Goodness! Bring the keys! What is this child doing?

Police officer	Get out! Get out! Hands up! Get out, get out! Put your hands in the air! Get out! Put your hands in the air!

Thabang	How did you find me?

Female Analyst	Mbali Zondo tipped us off.

Thabang	- Seriously? - Let’s Go and find out more.

Cassius	I still can't believe it. That you are back here, with me.

President Mulaudzi	I’m here now. Don't worry. You know I'm strong.

Cassius	You're my soldier.

President Mulaudzi	You know, Cass, something doesn't sit well with me.

Cassius	Mm?

President Mulaudzi	Hendrik and his people...who in this building has been helping them this entire day? Because there is.

Cassius	You're right.  We need to investigate. But if you ask me, I have a suspect.

President Mulaudzi	Who?

Cassius	The Minister of Finance.

President Mulaudzi	No. Mthombeni? Never!

Cassius	You were not here. You should’ve seen him refusing to co-operate, and his team disobey orders...when they went to deliver the money truck. That’s when I realised they were working with Hendrik.

President Mulaudzi	You have the wrong suspect.

Cassius	Why do you say that?

President Mulaudzi	I trust Mthombeni, just as much as I trust you. But there’s someone else we need to find.

Cassius	Mm.

President Mulaudzi	We will find them, just like we used to do during the struggle.

Cassius	You remember the bushes?

Hendrik	Listen, don’t do this! You’re hurting me!

Police officer	Hey, shut up!

Hendrik	Listen, this is not over! This is not over! Don't touch me! This is not over!

Thabang	It’s over, especially for you. Finally this long day has come to an end. You’re going to jail, where you belong. For a very long time.

Junior	You’re more stupid than I thought if you believe this will stop us. Come Monday and we’ll be out on bail. And who knows what will happen then? People like us, the Zondos, always get what they want in life. Unlike you, you won't get anything!

Thabang	Really? Shame.

Female Analyst	- No! - Thabang!

Hendrik	Hey, hey!

Thabang	- Say that again! - Thabang! - Repeat what you said. - Thabang! - Repeat it. - Thabang! I don’t work for you!

Mbali	Thabang, please don’t do this. - Please. - Listen to the mother of your child.

Thabang	This dog killed my mother. He doesn’t deserve prison. You deserve death, boy! You’ll leave this place a corpse. That’s if we all don’t leave as corpses.

Female Analyst	Ranaka.

Hendrik	Hey, hey. Shoot this dog!

Junior	Shoot this bastard, man!

Mbali	Thabang.

Thabang	This dog killed my mother. He doesn’t deserve prison. He deserves to die. You’ll leave this place a corpse. That’s if we both don’t leave as corpses. Do you hear me?

Mbali	Thabang. Look at me. Thabang! You’re a good man. You don’t deserve any of this. Looking back, I now know  the reason I was drawn to you... even though you were married. It’s because you were so pure. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the baby. I just felt so ashamed... for wrecking your marriage.Please...don’t let me and my family corrupt your soul. Our baby still needs your good influence in his or her life. Your daughter and wife need you.

Thabang	Mbali!

Mbali	I'm not doing this for Junior, Thabang! I’m doing this for you! My family has taken so much more from you. Don’t let them take your humanity too. Thabang, please.

Thabang	You’d rather kill me.

Mbali	I’m begging you, Thabang. Please.

Thabang	You’d rather kill me  as long as this boy dies with me.

Female Analyst	Thabang?

Mbali	- Thabang, please. - Let it go.

Female Analyst	Okay? Let it go. Are you okay? Uncuff her.

Police officer	Come here. We're not playing here. Shut up!

Minister of Police	Madam President.

President Mulaudzi	Minister.

Minister of Police	I have some good news.

President Mulaudzi	Out with it.

Minister of Police	Zondo has been captured! My people have him as we speak.

President Mulaudzi	That’s the best news I have heard today! Now, all that’s left is for us to find out who...among us, has been  helping Hendrik all day.

Minister of Police	Yes, Ma'am.

Thabang	No, no.

Bridget	It’s your father!

Dineo	What?

Thabang	I didn’t survive just so I could lose my hearing.

Female Analyst	It’s the President.

Thabang	Seriously? Madam President.

President Mulaudzi	Ranaka. You’re a brave man. Not only did you save my life today, apparently, you played a big role in Zondo’s capture. Thank you.

Thabang	I’m just serving the country, Ma’am. Well, as for me, I really don’t know how to thank you. The whole country of South Africa...owes you a lot. Mr. Ranaka, I also heard about the tragedy that befell you. I’m talking about your mother. Please...receive my condolences. I also know this is a bit too little too late. But I promise you, I’ll make sure that...the judges appointed to this case...know their job. Justice shall prevail.

Thabang	Thank you, Madam President. Thank you for your phone call. All right.

Female Analyst	What was that about?

Thabang	Uhm...she was thanking me for saving her life... and offering her condolences for my mother’s death.

Female Analyst	We also thank you.

Thabang	Yeah. So, what will you do with Mbali?

Female Analyst	She says she didn’t know  about her father’s deals. We’re taking her to the station to interrogate her. Let's hear what she has to say.

Dineo	So... listen, Ma.

Bridget	Mm?

Dineo	I think we should make this butter pudding. - Look. - It looks nice.

Bridget	- Come in. - Dad will love it! Hey!

Katlego	Hey! It’s hard to get in here. How are you?

Bridget	To keep the bad guys out.

Katlego	Good.

Bridget	I was just about to start cooking. What will you have? Would you like some coffee, some tea?

Katlego	I’m sorry, Bridget. It’s nothing personal.

Moses	Salaam-Alaikum.
