THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...Listening to good advice. 

THOMAS	When James was asked take the Mayor and The Fat Controller to a ball, he wanted to look his best.

THOMAS	But first James had to finish his other jobs. That made him dirty. So James went to the wash-down to get clean.

THOMAS	Then James found a little scratch on his paintwork. So he rushed to the Steamworks to be re-painted.

THOMAS	Victor warned James his new paint wouldn't dry in time for James to do his special job. But James didn't take Victor's advice.

THOMAS	Out on the tracks, dirt and leaves stuck to James' wet paint. 

THOMAS	Now James really did need repainting! And Edward got to take the Mayor and The Fat Controller to the ball.

THOMAS	If James had listened to Victor's advice, he would have got to do the special job.

THOMAS	And that's why you should always listen to good advice.
