WAKEFIELD	I had quarreled with my wife.

WAKEFIELD	We did this thing, where we would play at sexual jealousy.  Or, I played at it.  And she was my accomplice.After fourteen years of marriage, jealousy was the reliable stimulant. 

WAKEFIELD	Let’s be honest.  When your spouse gets jealous, it’s flattering.  The blood stirs.  The heart pounds.  We’d quarrel.  Then we’d have sex.  (then)Or as Diana would say, provocatively, “We’d fuck.”

WAKEFIELD	I was always the accuser. 
WAKEFIELD	And it works.  Until it doesn’t.

DIANA	Obviously I wasn’t coming on to him, obviously I was trying to get away.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Oh yeah obviously.  Obviously, anyone within ten feet of you could see what was going on with you two!
DIANA	Please, who’s even watching?  

HOWARD WAKEFIELD	You were hitting on the guy.

DIANA	Only in your peculiar imagination, Wakefield.

HOWARD WAKEFIELD	I witnessed the whole thing.

DIANA	God.  As if you weren’t chatting up every woman in the place. Meanwhile, I’m the one who’s flirting. 

HOWARD WAKEFIELD	You made a suggestive remark.  

DIANA	I made an amusing remark -  

HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“Amusing”!
DIANA	and everyone laughed but you.

HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Somehow I fail to be entertained by watching my wife come on to some guy in a polo shirt.
DIANA	I was replying to something he said, Wakefield.  Something stupid, if you must know.  I swear to God.  You have muzzled me to the point where I can’t carry on a casual conversation with other parents at the kids’ school.  I barely relate to people any more.

HOWARD WAKEFIELD	You were relating to him all right.  

DIANA	Wakefield, you know?  You exhaust me.  What are you not seeing here?  I mean, do you actually think I’d be even remotely inclined to start up something with anyone else?  Given the relationship we have? (then) I’m just getting through each day.  That’s basically what I think about.  I just want to get through the day.
WAKEFIELD	Can I be blamed for feeling that things were a little strange that night?
WAKEFIELD	When you’re tired, and it’s a long day, and you’re trying to get home, there’s kind of a Doppler effect in the mind.  You feel all these little disconnects as the slow trajectory of a collapsing civilization...
WAKEFIELD	At least that’s where I go.
WAKEFIELD	Are you ever suddenly, weirdly, conscious of the arbitrariness of place?  “I live here - yes - but why here?” Instead of somewhere else? Disorienting, that feeling. (then) I’m not making excuses for myself. 

WAKEFIELD	In the suburbs, “We live in nature.”  That’s a quote from our realtor, the selling phrase she used, when Diana and I first looked at this place.

WAKEFIELD	And you do see deer.  Rabbits. Crows.  But we don’t “live in nature”.  We’re separate.  That’s the point of the suburbs.  You live apart from humans.  Yet you’re protected from what’s wild.
WAKEFIELD	Of course, the deep change of heart can come over anyone.  I don’t see why, like everything else, it wouldn’t be in character.  
WAKEFIELD	After having lived dutifully by the rules, couldn’t a man shaken out of his routine, and distracted by a noise in his backyard, veer away from one door and into another, as the first, minor step in the transformation of his life?
WAKEFIELD	Why go in there now, just to endure a predictable scene with my wife?  Soon enough, they’d all be asleep.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Shit.
WAKEFIELD	You know, frankly, I was totally bewildered by the situation I’d created for myself.
WAKEFIELD	Certainly Diana would think I’d been with another woman.  Not that I’ve ever given her reason to doubt me.  In fourteen years of marriage.
WAKEFIELD	It would be the weakest of tactics for me to walk into my house and try to explain to her the perfectly rational sequence that led me to spend the night in the garage.  
WAKEFIELD	Even if she believed me, she’d see it as a lunatic move.  Which it wasn’t.  But try telling that to her. 
WAKEFIELD	Another woman might have saved my supper plate in the refrigerator.  But I lived in Diana’s judgment.  It shone on me as in a prison cell where the light is never turned off.
WAKEFIELD	The immediate solution, obviously, was to postpone my entrance till my wife had gone off to work.
DIANA	Your lunch! The girls take their lunches and hurry up the driveway.
WAKEFIELD	The first call would be to my office.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	No, he hasn’t come in. -  No.  Yesterday evening? - He didn’t say anything.  He left here around the usual time. - No, of course.  Yes, of course I will. 
WAKEFIELD	After a few calls to our friends, it seemed reasonable to expect that the Assistant Curator of the County Museum would depart for work.
WAKEFIELD	I realize this is a common enough complaint: But sometimes I feel I spend life just waiting for my wife to get ready to leave the house. 
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	You’re fucking kidding me...
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“That’s right, Officer, no checks are missing.  No, Officer, I already looked, his car is still here.”  Oh my, my, where could he be?
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“Woo! This is your hubs?  No wonder you want him back.  He’s a stud.”
WAKEFIELD	Our town police are well paid and polite.  And not so different from the rest of us, in their distant relationship to actual crime.  
MALE POLICE	My money’s on St. Barts.  This guy’s down there drinking piña coladas with his chiquita senorita.
FEMALE POLICE	They’re what, in St. Barts - they’re French-speaking there, right?
MALE POLICE	What am I, a travel agent?
WAKEFIELD	But then, god help us, the widow Babs.  Right on cue.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“This is all so utterly predictable, sweetheart, a total cliche.  Though believe me, if Howard has left you, precious - it’s the most interesting thing that man has ever done.  Never in a million years would I imagine he’d have the balls.  But darling, he’s never been the man for you.  I told you when you married him.”
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Ah, the bank account.  “But Mummy, Mummy, if he were leaving me, wouldn’t he clear out the accounts?”
WAKEFIELD	Gentle people of the jury, if your husband of fourteen years had that very day inexplicably vanished, would you go off to work as usual? 
WAKEFIELD	Are daily matters so very goddamn urgent at the local County Museum?  Or was that desperate call to the police a mere tactic, calculated to embarrass me? 
WAKEFIELD	Leave it to Mrs. Wakefield to turn a minor and rather amusing sidestep on my part into prima facie evidence of Howard’s thoughtless behavior. 
WAKEFIELD	I was snide and condescending to her mother.  I lacked interest in her work.  Or I wasted perfectly beautiful fall weekends, watching football games.
WAKEFIELD	Or, I wouldn’t agree to have the bedrooms painted.  And if she was such a feminist, why did my opening a door for her or helping her on with her coat matter so goddamn much?
WAKEFIELD	Standing there in the clear light of day, finally I could see: Diana felt that she’d married the wrong man.
WAKEFIELD	I ask you: What is so sacrosanct about a marriage and a family that you should have to live in it your whole life, however unrealized that life may be?   I ask you. 	
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Ah, Ben Jacobs.  Attorney at law.  Just dropping by for a little deli, eh, Ben?
WAKEFIELD	I say without shame: I’d given not a single thought to anyone at work.  
WAKEFIELD	And the documents I’d carried away with me? Documents vital to a very lucrative case we’d been preparing?  All of that was pretty remote now.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Oh right.  Make her the victim.  (addressing the friend) C’mon.  You don’t think this whole thing is just little convenient? (does falsetto) “Me?  Oh, I think she’s totally guilty.”
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	She’s hardly been abandoned, people.  I’m right here.*
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Oh, I see.  Here it is.  Yeah.  Saw that coming.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	What happened to “foul play”?  Huh?  A good man suddenly goes missing, and there’s no red flag?  I mean, who has the motive, right? 
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“May I bring to the attention of the Court that Mrs. Wakefield hosted a raucous celebration on the evening that her husband was officially declared missing.”  
WAKEFIELD	“What was the cause, huh?”
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“You mean to tell this jury, Mrs. Wakefield, that the very evening before your devoted spouse disappeared, witnesses observed you publicly throwing yourself at another -”  Ow shit!
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“A husband doesn’t just vanish, Mrs. Wakefield.  HOWARD WAKEFIELD	is on this earth, or under it.  And only you, madam, know which it is.”
WAKEFIELD	Do you accuse me of making a game of this?  I assure you, my frame of mind was quite rational.  Dead serious, in fact.  May I remind you? I was eating actual garbage to survive.
WAKEFIELD	About my wife’s deliberate nudity: Apparently it’s a side effect of her having once been a modern dancer.  - Briefly, I feel compelled to add.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Who exactly are you trying to attract out there?  
DIANA	No one can see.  And if they can, I don’t care.  
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Clearly.  Strutting around this house on full display.  At all times.  Would it kill you to put on some clothes in front of our girls?  
DIANA	I refuse to teach my daughters shame about having a body.  
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Oh! Maybe I should start parading around naked in front of them. Oh look!  Look at me!  Daddy’s naked! -
DIANA	Mr. Prude-o in the Nude-o? Yeah, right.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“Ooh look at me, I’ll go to work naked -!”
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Get away from there, dammit!
DIANA	No one’s out there, Howard!
WAKEFIELD	Seeing my wife in the nude, oddly enough, usually got me thinking about money.
WAKEFIELD	I had only a slender amount of cash with me.  And if it was my intention to disappear completely, using a credit card was out of the question.
WAKEFIELD	Yeah, obviously I could pre-date a bank check and cash it somewhere.  But when the statement came, Diana would see it, and think that my disappearance was premeditated.  Which of course it wasn’t.  
WAKEFIELD	It’s not difficult to run away.  People ditch their families all the time.
WAKEFIELD	But if this were the simple abandonment of wife and children, I’d have written Diana a note, taken my car out of the garage, driven into Manhattan - 
WAKEFIELD	checked into a hotel and walked to work in the morning.  Easy.  Anyone could do that.
WAKEFIELD	But you’d still be the same person.  This was different.
WAKEFIELD	You see, I no longer required those things that only days ago seemed so indispensable.  The armor of the clean shirt.  The smooth shave.  Credits cards, cell phone, clients.  There would be no more getting on the train.
WAKEFIELD	No apologies.  No excuses.  I would take nothing more from her.  Nothing from that house, ever.
WAKEFIELD	I would sustain myself like a castaway.  A survivor.  Undetected.
WAKEFIELD	That was the game.  If indeed it was a game. 
WAKEFIELD	Unshackled, I would become the 
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	I was meant to be.
AKEFIELD	Oh please.  You’ve imagined doing this yourself.  I know you have.
WAKEFIELD	But what about the twins, you ask? No regrets there?  
WAKEFIELD	In their current phase, the girls generally thought of me as someone they were unfortunate to live in the same house with.  An oddity, who embarrassed them in front of their friends.  Believe me, I was seeing more of these two now than I had in months, if not years.
WAKEFIELD	And I’m sure it’s not lost on you: Though I might have left my wife, I’d still be able to keep an eye on her.
WAKEFIELD	Our neighbor, Dr. Sondervan, is a known authority on Down Syndrome and other chromosomal disorders.  
WAKEFIELD	When he began to board a handful of patients, for a few months at a time, I stood up for Sondervan when our neighbors petitioned against him.  “Where’s the harm?”, I said, “They’re well-behaved.” 
WAKEFIELD	I have to say, for once it gave me the moral high ground.  Diana, naturally, took the opposing view.
WAKEFIELD	“Howard, really, do we have any idea what goes on behind those gates?”
WAKEFIELD	And the apparent answer, dear wife, is “Not too goddamn much”.
WAKEFIELD	In every marriage there’s a division of labor.  Mine, and yours.  By Diana’s artful calibration, her tasks occur only inside the house.
WAKEFIELD	Children.  Cleaning.  Provisioning. That means “shopping.”  Lots of shopping.  But anything external - 
WAKEFIELD	the roof, the gutters, chimney, trash, snow, servicing the cars - that’s all left to me.  Her duties end at the door.  - And of course any labor accomplished outside the house is invisible to my wife. 
WAKEFIELD	Paying the monthly bills, invisible.  
WAKEFIELD	Life insurance.  Home insurance. Property taxes.  Brokerage fees - and of course, our mortgage.  All faithfully - and invisibly - taken care of by one HOWARD WAKEFIELD	- 
WAKEFIELD	Now quite possibly deceased. 
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“I’m impressed with my attorney Bernie / Impressed with his influential friends / He’s got very big connections /and I follow his directions...”
WAKEFIELD	You know, I never used to sing. I think that’s worth noting.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	He’ll take some cream with that, Diana.  
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“You don’t happen to have soy milk?”
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Tell her about your tragic lactose intolerance, Ben.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“So if I sign this, I’m declaring my husband ‘absentee’?  What if I don’t sign?  Will it make him any less ‘absent’? “Bernie tells me what to do/Bernie lays it on the line...”
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 You douche.  - She’s out of your league, pal.
WAKEFIELD	“Absentee” or no, it’s a victory, I guess, to know I still have possession of my wife.
WAKEFIELD	Have I mentioned that Diana was a dancer before I met her?
WAKEFIELD	Did I tell you she was involved with someone else when she started seeing me?
WAKEFIELD	Dirk.  Dirk Morrison.  We met in the City through an alumni mixer, and hit it off.  Couple years later, my firm did some work for his firm. I guess he’d say we were friends.
WAKEFIELD	I’d never had a thing for dancers.  But somehow Dirk’s intense interest in Diana gave me ideas of my own.
WAKEFIELD	At first she wouldn’t go out with me.
DIANA	No.
HOWARD	Why not?
DIANA	You know why.
HOWARD	I don’t think I do.
DIANA	It’s obvious.  I’m seeing Dirk.  Your friend.  Dirk?  
HOWARD	Oh. Really?
DIANA	What?
DIANA	What?
HOWARD	I’m just not certain Dirk would tell it that way.
DIANA	How do you mean	?
HOWARD	Wow, you know, it feels like I shouldn’t get in the middle, here.
DIANA	What?  What did he say?
HOWARD	With Dirk, it’s more what the guy doesn’t say. Look, I don’t want to do the olderand-wiser thing but, um...I’d really hate to see you get hurt.  
HOWARD	So is that your opinion of me?  That I’m the kind of guy who’d try to get one over on Dirk?
DIANA	No!  I mean...I don’t know...
HOWARD	Look.  I know I’m a lawyer, but I’m not a total dirt bag.  Obviously I told Dirk I wanted to ask you out.  He seemed fine with it.  Really.
HOWARD	I just keep thinking about you.  I guess at a certain point, I realized I wasn’t thinking about much else which I shouldn’t admit, probably.  
HOWARD	And I went, “This is crazy, I have to ask him.”  And Dirk said, “Which one?  Diana?  Seriously?  Sure, whatever, go out with her.”  
WAKEFIELD	I lied, of course.
WAKEFIELD	On her side, I figure there was probably an element of revenge.  Not that she ran to Dirk with the news. I’d just been made a senior partner at the firm, plus I was editing for the Harvard Law Review.  Dirk was grinding away on Wall Street.  Diana was finishing up her Thesis in Art History.  So, busy people, right?  It took a while for Dirk to find out.
DIRK	That’s total bullshit, man!
HOWARD	She isn’t happy, Dirk.  And, let’s be serious, it’s not like anything’s really happening with you.
DIRK	That’s not true.  We have a thing. An understanding.
HOWARD 	“Understanding”?  Dirk.  You aren’t even fucking her.  You’re still like - coffee and a movie, pal.  
DIRK	Last week you said not to rush it.  Jesus.  - Did you tell Diana I gave you permission to ask her out?
HOWARD	What??  
DIRK	Just tell me.
HOWARD	No!  Dirk, look...She just doesn’t want to say what really happened.  She’s protecting you.
WAKEFIELD	Diana was torn between us of course. 
WAKEFIELD	The drama went on for, god, weeks.  At least.
WAKEFIELD	Till I made a genius, and I mean genius, strategic move. 
WAKEFIELD	Obviously, Diana had no aversion to sex - That side was well-developed,  clearly.  Why she’d never gone to bed with Dirk was - I’d made my move early on, in time to head it off.
WAKEFIELD	But in those early weeks she wasn’t sleeping with me either.  - Like I said.  She was confused.
HOWARD 	Look, whatever she’s telling you, she’s not asking me to back off.  Far from it.  
DIRK	She says she really cares about me.
HOWARD 	Oh man.  Diana...The reigning queen of mixed signals.  Maybe she’s playing both of us. In bed together last night, she started talking about moving in. With me.  Seriously.
DIRK	Wait - She’s - she’s not sleeping with you?
HOWARD	Yeah.  Obviously.  Since our first date.  She didn’t say anything?
WAKEFIELD	Genius, right?  
WAKEFIELD	I knew Dirk would do something stupid. 
WAKEFIELD	Within 24 hours, it had all played out.
DIANA	Sorry.
HOWARD	No, it’s good.
DIANA	I just never saw this side of him before.  This violence.
HOWARD	I’m not so surprised.  I’ve known this guy a long time.
WAKEFIELD	And thank you, Dirk Morrison.
WAKEFIELD	Would I have wanted her if she weren’t my best friend’s girl?
WAKEFIELD	Was I just jacked up by the competition?  That did occur to me, about a year into the marriage.
WAKEFIELD	But, by then your wife is pregnant, she’s carrying your child, and god I don’t know...She was just so beautiful, all over again.
WAKEFIELD	It makes you go a little crazy, that stuff.  That gorgeous round belly. It awakens this whole other level of - of - well, fear, I guess.
WAKEFIELD	You see.  This is how they get you.
WAKEFIELD	They maneuver things to that point where you feel like everything in your life is suddenly precious.  And simultaneously, totally precarious.  
WAKEFIELD	It just slams you.  The realization that everything with any meaning, anything you love, could just be taken away in some random event.
WAKEFIELD	I mean, anything could happen.
WAKEFIELD	But I’ll tell you, now, watching from exile like this, for the first time I felt Diana was truly mine. If I’d left her in the conventional sense - if I’d divorced her - no one would blame my wife if she began entertaining hordes of men.
WAKEFIELD	By simply vanishing, I placed her in a, let’s say, a distant category.  
WAKEFIELD	Till it’s known what’s become of her husband, Mrs. Wakefield remains “not quite available.”  A power move?  Am I intentionally frustrating her?  Not at all, my love.
WAKEFIELD	I’m sure you have vivid memories of what you’re missing.  I know I do.  
WAKEFIELD	I just want you to want me as much as I want you.
WAKEFIELD	When people are leaving for summer vacation, they put out more trash.  Clean out the fridge.  Never fails.
WAKEFIELD	Ah, the tell-tale signs.  There’s always ice cream.
WAKEFIELD	I make a practice of noting which of these soon-to-be-vacant houses have large dogs.	
WAKEFIELD	I have my scruples.  I never take anything but food.
WAKEFIELD	Like the Native American hunters who killed for meat and fur and later gave thanks to the buffalo’s soul, I extend the same to my neighbors.  
WAKEFIELD	Not really.  I’ve no illusions about the morality of what I was doing.
WAKEFIELD	I’ll spare you a tiresome diatribe about our nation’s level of consumer waste.  
WAKEFIELD	Every two weeks, residents here put out the big stuff.  Whatever isn’t strictly garbage.  By one in the morning, it’s all on the sidewalk.  
WAKEFIELD	By two a.m., anything usable is gone.
WAKEFIELD	Gleaners, from the south end of town.  
WAKEFIELD	Bottom feeders.
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	You go.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	No, you go.
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Mom said you had to.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	And I’m saying you have to.
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	I don’t have to listen to you.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Yes you do.
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Make me. Ow!  I’m telling.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Go up there.  Mommy said.  You bring it down, I’ll help you carry stuff.
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	I don’t want to!   There’s spiders.  You go.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Mom told you to.
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	I don’t have on shoes!
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	I’ll get splinters.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	And I won’t?  Do you see me wearing shoes?
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	We’ll both go.
WAKEFIELD	I blame myself, for getting lulled into the domestic routine.
WAKEFIELD	Day after day, so much is the same. The children.  Diana.
WAKEFIELD	Handymen and gardeners. 107A	
WAKEFIELD	Neighbors.
WAKEFIELD	* Tradesmen.	*
WAKEFIELD	Week after week.
WAKEFIELD	Then one day, routine goes to hell. 
WAKEFIELD	Exhibit A.  Diana couldn’t be taking the girls on our usual summer trip to the Cape?  Ludicrous.  How could she possibly afford it this year? 
WAKEFIELD	Granted, I’d left the coffers full. I’d substantially reduced our mortgage with last year’s bonus.  And don’t forget the investment accounts.  Still -
WAKEFIELD	- Diana had very little coming in these days.  Would she really damage our savings, just to loll around on the beach? In her very small bikini.
WAKEFIELD	God, the three of them.  I’m trying to track the exact moment those three became the opposing team.   
WAKEFIELD	The many times I’ve listened under windows.  Did I hear my name spoken, even once?  “Daddy”? “Howard”? “Your father”?  
WAKEFIELD	So why was I so concerned about their financial situation?  
WAKEFIELD	I’m the one who’s impoverished, goddammit!  Scrounging every meal.  It’s hot as blazes in that attic!
WAKEFIELD	Obviously my wife herself would have to come up here tonight.  When she gets home from work... 
WAKEFIELD	(CONT'D) ...to carry away those essential vacation items that Howard Wakefield, devoted husband, had so obediently opened his wallet to buy. 
WAKEFIELD	I ask you, Am I a slave??
WAKEFIELD	An animal?? 
WAKEFIELD	CONT’D A prisoner.   That’s what I’d made myself.  The fuck-wit prisoner of all time.
WAKEFIELD	Where is it written that our species has to live indoors?  Cut off from instinct.  From sensation.  Why not live in the wild?  Indeed, I ask this Court: Why live anywhere else?
WAKEFIELD	Home is a habit, like anything else.  
WAKEFIELD	Apparently I seem deranged.
WAKEFIELD	I convey a certain lost grandeur.  An émigré, with a secret past.
WAKEFIELD	I could use a change of clothing, apparently.  It’s more of a problem for everyone else, really.  
WAKEFIELD	In my situation, frankly, it’s easy to become lax about keeping up with events. 
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	That is a chunk of change, Dirk.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Loser.
WAKEFIELD	What’s amazing - is that ol’Dirk and I ended up in the same line of work. Dirk Morrison, junk man.  Scavenging the remnants of what, pizza chains and supermarkets?  Buying, raiding, flipping.  Poor bastard.  Sounds exhausting.
WAKEFIELD	Is it just me? Or is it oddly relaxing when the wife goes out of town?  
WAKEFIELD	Oh, don’t get me wrong.  I miss her, naturally.
WAKEFIELD	Did I ever worry that someone might recognize me on one of these expeditions to town?  Constantly. 
WAKEFIELD	Diana.  Coming home early from the Cape.  She could show up any moment.  
WAKEFIELD	Yeah.  Hilarious.  But I had no intention of actually surrendering my freedom.
WAKEFIELD	Why would I ever go back to the way I lived before?
WAKEFIELD	You do realize, I hope, that none of this was a rejection of my wife or - or - suburban life or any of that.
WAKEFIELD	You see, I never left my family.  I left myself.  
WAKEFIELD	I stepped into the wild.  Into that primal arena a beach vacation in Cape Cod only pretends to supply.
WAKEFIELD	Here was the Original World. 
WAKEFIELD	Beasts and humans in sacred communion. 
WAKEFIELD	There I exaggerate.  Let me ask you this - Do you realize how many rules we’ve had to put in place, just to keep basic human order?
WAKEFIELD	Well, the primal world, there’s one law. 
WAKEFIELD	We are food to one another.  Or we are not.  That’s it.  End of story.  
WAKEFIELD	That’s civilized, compared to the rest of us.
WAKEFIELD	You know how in late summer there’s always that first night of autumn?  That familiar chill?
WAKEFIELD	The crucial thing was: I no longer had a pair of shoes. 
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Hey! Mine!
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 No! 
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Mine!
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Mine!
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Mine!  Mine!  Mine!
EMILY	There.
HERBERT	Herbert.
EMILY	Herbert.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Herbert.
EMILY	Emily.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Emily.  - Emily and Herbert.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Howard.
EMILY	Howard.
HERBERT	Shoes.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	No.  Go back.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Listen.  You can’t tell anyone you saw me.  Understand?
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Secret.  Okay?  Secret.  Don’t tell.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Understand?
HERBERT	Shhh.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Now go.
WAKEFIELD	Obviously, the sensible thing to do was leave.
WAKEFIELD	But how could I abandon my home?
WAKEFIELD	Diana would be coming back soon.  My daughters. 
WAKEFIELD	Coming up the garage stairs, to put their vacation gear away. 
WAKEFIELD	I should go sleep in the woods.
WAKEFIELD	Suppose they do tell someone, those two, next door?...I should leave.
WAKEFIELD	See?  See, they’ve forgotten me.  
WAKEFIELD	Have I mentioned that I was lonely?
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	...That’s a bicycle pump.  You use it to put air in bicycle tires...  Toboggan, for riding in the snow.  
WAKEFIELD	Other than running for my life from those scavengers, I’d had no human contact.
WAKEFIELD	I enjoyed their questions.  Enjoyed explaining things.  When you’re alone for so long, you forget the simple human exchange
EMILY	Good job, Herbert.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Don’t come up here again.  Or I’ll have to go away.  Do you understand? (points to himself) Secret.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	 Don’t come back.  I mean it.
WAKEFIELD	They’d never be able to keep their end of it, I knew.  
WAKEFIELD	“When my family gets back,” I tell myself.  “That’s when you’ll go.”
WAKEFIELD	And you expect me to just walk away?
WAKEFIELD	Look at me.  Look how I live.  What I’ve sacrificed, to be here.
WAKEFIELD	I’ll go but, dammit, not yet.  Not yet.   
WAKEFIELD	She’s buying the cheaper cuts of meat.   Saving her pennies. 
WAKEFIELD	Suppose she has to sell the house?  
WAKEFIELD	How far am I willing to let this thing go? 
WAKEFIELD	Then again, I could be exposed at any moment.  What then?  How would a man ever explain himself to his wife?
WAKEFIELD	No.  Emily and Herbert, those two, they like having a secret.  They wouldn’t give me up.  If I did go back...I mean, how would I begin?  
WAKEFIELD	What would I say?  She’d think I'd vacated my senses.
WAKEFIELD	Which is so unfair.  If anything, I’d come into my senses.  Fully. 
WAKEFIELD	My god.  I could see it so clearly. I’d constructed the whole thing.  
WAKEFIELD	The jealousy.  The resentment -
WAKEFIELD	The selfish urgency -
WAKEFIELD	Howard as victim.  Howard as persecutor -  
WAKEFIELD	Howard as Master Of The World.
WAKEFIELD	That was the prison.  That’s what I’d escaped.  Leaving me where, now? 
WAKEFIELD	The Outcast of the Cosmos.
WAKEFIELD	I’ll tell you this.  You can think whatever you like.  I love my wife now as I’ve never loved her before. 
WAKEFIELD	Hey.  She’s cut her hair short.
WAKEFIELD	Boys.   
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	...Yeah, when did that happen?
WAKEFIELD	Hey.  Check this out.  She’s taking dance class again.  	
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	That’s good.
WAKEFIELD	She seems a little tired tonight.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Yeah.  Yeah, the kids run her ragged....They’re getting so tall now, huh? 
WAKEFIELD	They look more like Diana these days, don’t you think?
WAKEFIELD	There’s no point denying it.  They were all much happier without me.  	
WAKEFIELD	So I’m guessing Thanksgiving Dinner will be at Bab’s house this year. 
WAKEFIELD	You know what that means.  Zilch-o for me in the leftovers department.
WAKEFIELD	I’ll be fine.  Christ, a family of ten could eat for weeks on what my neighbors throw out.
WAKEFIELD	Stuff’ll keep forever.  The whole attic’s like a goddamn refrigerator.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	“Why spend good money insulating the garage?  For Chrissake, we could have granite counter tops...”
WAKEFIELD	Unfortunately HOWARD WAKEFIELD	had ignored some basic repairs.
HOWARD’S INNER VOICE	What about when it starts snowing?
HOWARD’S INNER VOICE	What then?  I’ll be trapped.
HOWARD’S INNER VOICE	I won’t be able to go out.  Diana would think she has a prowler.
HOWARD’S INNER VOICE	Snow on the windows.  Frosted glass.  
HOWARD’S INNER VOICE How am I supposed to keep track?  What’s the point, if I can’t even see inside? Stupid, it’s Thanksgiving, they’re not home.  Go sleep in the cellar.  By the furnace.   Who would know?
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	No!
DIANA	Careful, I spent hours, sweetie.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Can I go to Tracy’s?
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Me too.
DIANA	Your homework done?
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Duh.
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Mine’s not due till Tuesday as they cross the garden’s unspoiled snow.  Sunlight glints off the garage windows above.  We’re aware as they happily chatter that Wakefield is hidden up there, deathly ill - 
DIANA	One of you might shovel these steps.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Okay...
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Wait, wait...It’s NOT Diana: It’s Emily
WAKEFIELD	“The quality of mercy is not strain'd?” “It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath?” Your whole life you hear that quoted.  I never got it till now.   
WAKEFIELD	Mercy...It’s not something you ever get to request. “Not strained” means not forced.  It’s given.  Freely.  No reason.  A gift just drops from the sky.
WAKEFIELD	Twice blessed.  “Blessing him that gives and him that takes”.  If I remember correctly.
WAKEFIELD	The giving and the taking all in one.
WAKEFIELD	These days, unexpectedly, I find myself thinking of the law.  And property rights. 
WAKEFIELD	Specifically, this HOWARD WAKEFIELD having disappeared, and not being found after diligent inquiry, would soon be declared absentee.
WAKEFIELD	Wakefield’s spouse would become temporary administrator of his property, till such time as he is declared legally dead, and the provisions of his will come into play.  
WAKEFIELD	But - when does this death occur?
WAKEFIELD	A year from now?  Two?  I should know this...Is it five?
WAKEFIELD	Will I still be here, five years from now?  Haunting a former life.  
WAKEFIELD	If not, how do I leave?  And when? Do I even retain the right to come home?
WAKEFIELD	I’ve expunged the law from my mind. Wiped it clean.  That’s one victory. You don’t think that’s possible? 
WAKEFIELD	Oh I think I’ve more than proven: You can in fact step out of the shelter of the self, straight into nothing.  And become pure, cold air.
WAKEFIELD	I’m trying to understand why I’d * even do the stunt I pull next.  	*
WAKEFIELD	Why play such a game?...Unless it’s 	* not a game.  
WAKEFIELD	“At the bottom of the affair lies a * morbid vanity.”  Or something like that.  ...What’s that from?  	
WAKEFIELD	Suppose she’d recognized us.  My god.
HOWARD	Unthinkable.  
WAKEFIELD	I mean, the shock of it.  To look into Diana’s eyes.  Her eyes. 
WAKEFIELD	That I’ve seen into countless, countless times.  To look into those eyes, and see nothing?
WAKEFIELD	I comfort myself that it’s only because Diana didn’t know me.  Which, of course, is no consolation -  
WAKEFIELD	My own wife didn’t know me.  
WAKEFIELD	I had no idea how one-sided this relationship had become.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Geez!  It’s cold out here.
DIANA 	Put on your coat, sweetie.
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	I’ll be quick.  Where should I dump Daddy’s clothes?
WAKEFIELD	Good good.  They’re emptying our closets. 
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Freezing! 
WAKEFIELD	Now would be the moment, Wakefield, to declare yourself.  Now, before every thread of your warm clothing passes into the hands of strangers. 
WAKEFIELD	Now.
WAKEFIELD	Am I a coward?  
WAKEFIELD	Is that what you think?  I’m afraid of facing her rejection?
WAKEFIELD	Or, as a man of principle, am I more than ever resolved to see this thing through?	 
WAKEFIELD	And by “this thing”...what the hell do I even mean?
WAKEFIELD	Gone is The Provider.  The Family Man.  The Litigator.  The Husband.  All that remains - is the Lover.
WAKEFIELD	Enduring.  Passionate.
WAKEFIELD	Love without reason.  Without need.  Without strategy.  I love her because she belongs to me.  And I love her because she doesn’t.
WAKEFIELD	And I know if I come in from exile, there’s every chance I’ll lose her. On the other hand - I know this look she has.  From deep memory.
WAKEFIELD	My wife, infatuated.  Eager to please.  - I mean, it had to happen.  It’s a basic human need.  She’s beautiful.  She’s young.  Why shouldn’t she seek a little...a little tenderness? I’m not saying I welcome this.  I’m saying I understand. 
DIANA	Just leave it by the door for now.
WAKEFIELD	Company for dinner?  Who can it be. A generous patron she met at the museum?  Or is it some very lucky dance instructor? 
WAKEFIELD	Aha.  A city feller, eh?
WAKEFIELD	He was tall.  That’s all I knew at first.
WAKEFIELD	My, my.  Coffee and dessert in the living room.  This is a special evening.
WAKEFIELD	Christ, Diana.  You’re really piling it on.
DIANA	Good night.
MAN	Night!
WAKEFIELD	Fucking hell.  Dirk Morrison? Then again, who else would it be?
WAKEFIELD	The unfinished business.  He’s told her everything by now.  They’ve compared stories...revived the past. Jesus. Well, at least she knows now.  At least that’s been disposed of.
WAKEFIELD	You do understand, that this was the music of our courtship? 
WAKEFIELD	Is there a man on earth who’d stand by, and let another man lay claim to his wife and family?
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD 	We still going to the mall?
DIANA	Afterward.  That’s the plan.   Did you bring your Christmas money?
SMALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	What are we giving to Mimi Babs?
TALLER THIRTEEN YEAR OLD	Can we have pizza tonight and decorate the tree?
DIANA	Wouldn’t be Christmas without it.  
WAKEFIELD	Do you have any idea how weird it is to be driving a car again?  To be subject to rules? 
WAKEFIELD	I’m fascinated by the lanes.
WAKEFIELD	What’s to stop me from just crossing over?
WAKEFIELD	Are we all feeling the fragility of boundaries?  The artifice?  “That’s your lane, this is mine.”  “We agree.”  That’s the basis of law, in a nutshell.  “We agree.”  But, what if you don’t agree?
WAKEFIELD	You forget the godawfulness.  The buildings.  Their floors stacked up like that.
WAKEFIELD	People...stacked over one other, floor after floor in endless replication.  - Is anyone else seeing this? 
WAKEFIELD	Impossible to imagine I worked here once.  That I could ever work here again.   Why would I ever go back? One thing at time, Howard. Construct it.  First this, and then that.
WAKEFIELD	My little visit to the thrift store was solely so I could pass through this door. 
WAKEFIELD	First that, and now this.
WAKEFIELD	Black cashmere coat.  Pin-striped suit. Turnbull & Asser spread collar shirt.  Sober Armani silk tie.
HOWARD WAKEFIELD	Honey!  I’m home.
