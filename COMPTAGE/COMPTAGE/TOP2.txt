NIGEL	Hello and welcome Thomas fans to another Top Five Sodor Moments... And welcome to my good friend Stan.

STAN 	Hello, Nigel. So what are we looking at today?

NIGEL	Today, Stan we're counting down the Top Five engine Rebuilds, Repaints and Repairs.

STAN    	Sounds very exiting! Let's get cracking shall we?

NIGEL   	Well straight in at number five is... Glynn!

STAN    	Yes, now Glynn's not a new engine is he, Nigel? In fact he's very old. 

NIGEL   	That's right, Stan. He's almost as old as Stephen! Glynn was forgotten...

STAN   	Neglected...

NIGEL  	Abandoned...

STAN    	Ignored...

NIGEL  	Until... He was discovered by Marion!

STAN   	Well not exactly discovered, Nigel. At first Marion thought Glynn was a talking tree!

NIGEL   	Quite right, Stan. It was actually Thomas and Percy who rescued him. And now Glynn is fully repaired and works for Sir Robert Noromby.

STAN     	Also known as the Earl of Sodor!

NIGEL    	Yes, and he has a new and exciting career  up there at Ulfstead Castle.

STAN    	Smashing! 

NIGEL   	In at number four is... James!

STAN    	Oh yes, now James has had quite a transformation... A repair, rebuild and a repaint all in one go!

NIGEL   	Do tell me more!

STAN    	It was after an accident which involved James' wooden brakes catching fire.

NIGEL   	Oohhh! Looks nasty!

STAN  	It certainly was, Nigel. But this story has a happy ending. James was rebuilt with new metal brakes that don't catch fire.

NIGEL 	And he was repainted his splendid, shiny red! Very smart!

STAN  	James certainly thinks so!

STAN    	So, Nigel who's at number three?

NIGEL	At number three... It's Stephen!           

NIGEL	Stephen arrived in a crate.

STAN    	In a crate? Are you sure about that, Nigel? 

NIGEL	I'm positive, Stan. He arrived in a crate and was completely rebuilt back to his former glory!

STAN    	Yes, we're looking at a very special engine here, Nigel. In his day Stephen was the fastest engine in the world. 

NIGEL	He went like the rocket!

STAN    	Stephen by name, Rocket by nature!

NIGEL	And in at number two is Gordon!

STAN    	Ah, yes. Gordon was re-designed with special 'streamlining' which helped him go faster. 

NIGEL	Gordon was renamed 'The Shooting Star'! 

STAN	And did he go faster and win the race like a 'Shooting Star'?

NIGEL	Sadly not, Stan. In fact he broke down about half way through. 

STAN	Ohh, that looks like quite a breakdown!

STAN 	Well, that only leaves one more spot, Nigel. The Number One spot! And it er goes to... Er...

NIGEL	It goes to a very cheeky engine that was once green!

STAN    	Oh I'm with you, Nigel. There can be only one number one engine!

NIGEL	That's right, Stan!

STAN    	...Thomas!

NIGEL	...Thomas!

STAN 	Who else could it be!

NIGEL	Thomas was re-painted to his legendary blue…

STAN    	And was made The Fat Controller’s Number One Engine! Ohh, it brings tears to my eyes, Nigel.

NIGEL	Yes it's a heart warming story of a very famous, very useful, number one engine!

STAN    	You know what, Nigel? Someone should write a book about him...

NIGEL	I think someone already did, Stan.

STAN    	Smashing! I knew that…Well until next time, then...

NIGEL	When we see you again for more Top Five Sodor Moments!

STAN 	Super!

NIGEL	Reverend somebody, wasn't he?
