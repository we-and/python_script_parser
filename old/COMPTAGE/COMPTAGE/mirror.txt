Jemma	Hi, I'm Jemma.  

Steve	Jemma, nice to meet you, hello.  

Jemma	Welcome to our application video.  

Steve	Shall we go into any more detail now or are we… 

Matt	No, let's wait 'til it arrives.  

Steve	Yeah? 

Matt	Yeah.  

Steve	This is all the shit that I robbed from school.  Jem, you're gonna be using that, right, the handycam?  With the toplight.  

Jemma	Shall I demonstrate?  

Matt	Nice little one.  


Steve	Matt.	
 
Matt	This is mine, yeah?  

Steve	Unfortunately not, you're gonna get something much smaller than that.  

Matt	What? 

Jemma	Ah, gutted.  

Matt	That's clearly for me, that's about the size I should be using.  

Steve	It's not the size that matters, it's how you fucking use it.  

Matt	Yeah. 

Steve	You need to keep your mics on at all times, right, so we can hear everything.  And we wanna film everything all the time.  

Jemma	Ah, sorry, all the time?  

Steve	All the time.  

Matt	Oh what, yeah, I can't switch this off?  

Steve	We have to film and we have to hear everything.  

Steve	Ok, I've got something prepared for you already.  

Matt	Ok.

Jemma	What?  

Steve	Just a little exam for you, just a little teaser for you guys.  

Matt	Want me to take this?  Ok, fine. 

Matt	Oh my god.  What is coming at us?  

Steve	Motherfucker. 

Matt	You haven’t even got eye holes.  

Steve	One million dollars!  How much money are we gonna win?  

Matt	A million dollars.  

Steve	Oh! 

Jemma	Oh! 

Matt	Oh fuck, mate are you alright?  
 
Jemma	Shit, are you ok?  

Steve	Yeah, I'm fine.  

Matt	Ready? 

Steve	Yeah.  Hello, I'm Steve and this is our application for the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.  

Steve	And we're gonna win.  

Steve	Do you, Jemma, believe in ghosts?  

Jemma	I don't believe in ghosts.  

Steve	Why the fuck not? 

Jemma	Because… 

Steve	Look at the camera.  

Jemma	Sorry.  I just don't.  I've never experienced anything weird or scary.  

Steve	In the back of your mind there is a chance, right?  Because we wanna win this challenge, surely?  

Jemma	Yeah, no, I mean I wanna win the money and I'm willing to help but my own personal view is that it's not true and I'm doing this as well to kind of, you know, see if anything happens.  I'm curious, I'm curious.  

Steve	Ok.  Say we win. 

Jemma	Yeah. 

Steve	What would you do with the money?  

Jemma	I think I'd save it.  

Matt	Ooh, calm down. 
	
Jemma	What?  
Matt	When I was like, four, I came into my living room and grabbed my mum and was like, "Grandpa wants to speak to you."  

Steve	Yep.  

Matt	And she didn't really know what to say, but like I took her by the hand and like, pulled her into our dining room and was like, "grandpa, grandpa wants to speak to you, he's there, he's there."  And I pointed to this chair.  But my grandpa died before I was born.  

Steve	Ooh.  

Matt	And I never met him, but apparently… 

Steve	So was it like, some other old geezer?  

Matt	Well apparently the chair that I pointed to was the one that he would always sit in.  In the dining room.  When he came round.  

Steve	Shit.  
Steve	What would you do with the cash?  

Matt	I would go on a bender.  

Steve	Yes.  

Matt	I mean come on, if we win this thing… 

Steve	You're not gonna save it?  

Matt	No.  Boring people save.  I mean what are you, you just win 333.333.  

Steve	And does your best bud get a present?  

Matt	You, yeah of course you do.  

Steve	What do I get?  

Matt	You can have a pen.

Steve	A pen?  

Matt	You can have a commemorative pen.  

Matt	Do you believe in ghosties?  

Steve	Yes. 
 
Jemma	And why?  

Steve	Because I would really like to, it would be really fun.  

Jemma	What?  

Matt	Have you ever seen one, or..?  

Steve	I've never seen one, no.  

Matt	No personal experiences?  

Steve	I believe in dinosaurs but I've never seen a dinosaur. 

Jemma	There's evidence of a dinosaur existing.  

Jemma	What would you do with the money?  

Matt	I mean surely just a new pair of jeans.  

Steve	No, I wanna make a film, man.  

Jemma	Yeah, look at that big hole.  I don’t know if you can see this.  Can you see that?  

Matt	Oh it's here.  

Steve	Hello?  

Steve	Yeah, yeah.  

Matt	Alright, let's go. 


Jemma	Guys! 

Steve	Mate, it's here.  It's fucking here.  

Steve	Yeah at least it's got some weight to it, it’s not like a piece of shit kind of thing.  

Matt	Yeah.  It’s the weight of all the ghosties. 

Steve	Oh my god, mate, can you believe it's here?  On the day it's supposed to be.  

Matt	I know.  

Steve	Here she is.  

Jemma	So this is it.  

Steve	Rargh!  

	
Steve	Oh my god, man, this is making me feel really creepy.  

Matt	Yeah, it's bigger than I thought it was gonna be.  

Steve	Mate, I'm so fucking… 

Steve	We got it!  

Matt	Should we do something for our like, application?  

Matt	We found out about your challenge and went and ebayed some paranormal stuff.  

Steve	You said loads of people had viewed it, right?  And we're the only people who put an offer… 

Matt	Yeah, it had like, 25,400 something views.  

Steve	We're the only people who even put an offer in, right?  

Matt	No one bid, no bids.  And I was like, look mate, give it to me now.   

Jemma	Exactly, because they all knew it was crap.  

Steve	First person to open it gets cursed.  

Jemma	That's not true.  


Steve	Is it? 

Jemma	Fine, I don't mind.  

Steve	Better you than me.  

Matt	I thought you weren't superstitious.  Ok.

Jemma	I am superstitious actually.  

Matt	Ok.  Well just try not to break it, because that's seven years of bad luck to start with.  

Jemma	Great.  

Steve	Alright, be easy, easy, easy, this is our baby.  
 

Steve	Read something out to me, read something.  

Matt	Yorkshire Relish.  Obtain 2400 drops of concentrated flavour.

Jemma	Gala week.  

Steve	Is there nothing like, and he killed her with an axe?  

Matt	That’s cool. 

Steve	Disappointing, right?   

Jemma	I think so, but then you know what I’m like.  

Matt	It's not exactly the antique we were going for.  


Jemma	You've been ripped off, you've been ripped off.  Ah, you've been ripped off.  

Matt	We don't know that.  

Steve	Welcome to mirror cam.  

Steve	24 hours, all day, all night.  Seven days a week.  She's not gonna miss a thing. 

Steve	Boo.  
Matt	Ok.  Video diary, day one in the haunted mirror house.  Not much to report, it's been an exciting day and certainly with all the surveillance it feels like something's going on.  

Jemma	Oh Matt.  Put the camera away. 

Matt	Which it is now.  

Matt	You have to do video diaries for Steve.  

Jemma	Oh, Steve the perv.  

Matt	You have to, look.   

Jemma	No!  No.  
Steve	So today was thoroughly disappointing.  Not what I was expecting.  Nothing really kicked off.  Weirdest thing that happened to me today is I can't remember taking my socks off.  

Steve	I dreamt of my dad last night, which was really nice 'cause I saw his face.  

Steve	And I hope he understands why I'm doing this.  
 
	Jemma
Steve, 	Steve.  
 
Jemma	Shh, shh.  

Steve	What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  

Jemma	Come on.  

Steve	Is it a ghost?  

Jemma	No, it's Matt.  

Steve	Is this a joke?  

Jemma	Shh.  

Steve	I'm gonna fucking kill you if this is a joke.  

Jemma	He's asleep.  

Steve	That is so creepy.
  
Steve (cont)	What should we do?
  	
Jemma	I don't think we should wake	him up.  


Steve	No, you're not supposed to. 

Steve	Jem?  Jem!  

Jemma	Yeah?  

Steve	He's, he’s weed on the floor.  

Jemma	Oh my god.  

Steve	Jem, he's done a wee in his pants.  Oh my god.  

Jemma	Oh come on Matt, get out of bed.  

Steve	Is he coming?  You're kidding me.  

Jemma	He’s coming, he’s coming. 

Jemma	Hey baby! 

Matt	Morning, filming already?  Nice.  

Steve	Walk of shame if I ever saw one.  

Jemma	How are you feeling today?  

Steve	He has no idea.  

Matt	Yeah, I'm alright.  

Jemma	You good?  Yeah.  

Matt	Yeah, I'm tired.  

Jemma	are you wearing the same, are these the same pants that you were wearing last night?  


Steve	Oh shit.  The wrong trousers.  
Jemma	Don't worry, I won't tell your mother.  

Matt	This was last night?  

Jemma	Yeah.  

Matt	What the hell am I doing?  

Jemma	Look. 

Steve	You can see the pain in his eyes.  

Jemma	Yeah, look at that.  There's a massive wet patch, which you're definitely clearing up off the floor today, because I'm not.  
Matt	I haven't done that for years.  

Steve	You've done it before?  

Jemma	Oh no.  Why didn't you tell me?  

Matt	Yeah sleep walking, not wetting myself.  Dick.   

Steve	His ex girlfriend, he pissed on her. 

Jemma	Maybe it's his thing.  

Matt	I used to do it when I was like six, I used to sleepwalk all the time.  

Steve	Yeah?  

Matt	Yeah.  

Matt	And they had to, they ended up having to lock my door, because like, I basically fell down the stairs and like, fractured my skull right here.  

Jemma	What?  

Steve	When you were six? 

Jemma	You never said that.  

Matt	Yeah.  

Jemma	Oh my god.  

Matt	It was proper horrible.  

Steve	Have you got a groovy scar? 

Matt	Yeah, do you wanna feel it?  

Steve	Yeah, let me see it.  

Matt 	It's just there. 

Steve	Holy shit, man.  

Jemma	So you're gonna change the sheets today, yeah?  
 
Matt	I can't believe I pissed myself.  

Jemma	Have you checked this for any ghosts?  

Steve	Yeah, I checked it this morning, there's nothing.  
Matt	It's blinking, are we good?  

Steve	It's blinking.  Oh, I'm not sure.  Yeah man, we got it.  

Matt	Yeah?  
Matt	So this is gonna be recording wherever I go, right?  

Steve	Yeah man, surfers and skateboarders use them.  

Jemma	Yeah.
Matt	Really?  	
Steve	Now sleepwalkers use them. 

Matt	Like action sequences?  

Jemma	oh don't tell him that.  Don't tell him that.  

Matt	What do I look like?  

Matt	Oh nice.  

Steve	You look well cool.  

Matt	I look like a fucking secret agent.  

Steve	Alright bro, so, James Bond style.  

Matt	Here I go.  
 
Matt	Come on.  

Matt	Allahu akbar! 

Steve	Whoa! 

Steve	That is like mirror cam on the go, mirror cam on speed.  
Matt	I'm the main event now.  

Steve	He's the money.  With that on him.  

Matt	Look. 

Steve	Million pound man.  

Matt	Ok it's blinking, we're ready for the night.  

Matt	Mmm.  I feel like there's something between us.  
Jemma	Thank you Steve, you've ruined our sex life.  

Matt	Goodnight.  Ok.  Goodnight, sort of.  

Jemma	Whoa, that was good.  

Matt	That was rubbish.

Jemma	That was good. 

Matt	You were not even gonna hold that for a second.  

Steve	While you guys were watching Sex in the City I thought I'd fucking, you know, try and get something going.  Something's gotta happen, right?  

Matt	Smooth.

Steve	I've got a surprise for you both.  

Jemma	Oh my god.

Steve	Here we go. 

Steve	Have you ever done one before?  

Matt	No.  

Jemma	No.  

Steve	What is your name?  

Steve	No. 
Jemma	No, it's not doing anything.  
Matt	This is bull…oh, whoa.  
Steve	Ok it’s alright, I'm back, I'm back in again.  
Matt	I didn't do that.  

Steve	T, T.  

Jemma	T?

Steve	I'm telling you now, this is not me.  

Steve	It’s like…

Matt	In the middle. 

Steve	O.

Matt	O.  

Steve	Straight up.  

Matt	And this one. 

Steve	N?  N.  

Matt	Yeah.  

Steve	Are you doing this?  

Matt	No.  

Steve	I think it's just a combination of the two of us.  

Matt	I kind of think it is.  Tony! 

Steve	Tony! 

Matt	Tony the motherfucking ghost.  

Jemma	We have a name.  

Matt	That was shit.   That was crap. 

Jemma	Oh, I'm really disappointed.  I wanted it to be a girl. 

Steve	Alright come on, we've gotta try again.  Let’s, let’s… 

Matt	T, T, Matt.  

Steve	Candles, candles, blow them.  Oh shit balls.  

Jemma	Oh.

Steve	Mate.  

Jemma	What's he doing?  Matt?  

Steve	Matt…

Jemma	Matt, very funny Matt.  

Steve	Think he's about to piss his pants.  

Steve	Seen that face before.  

Jemma	I'll get the nappies.  

Steve	Matt?  

Steve	Matt?  Give me the camera, Jem.  

Jemma	Yeah, yeah, take it.  

Steve	Matt?  

Steve	What was, what was the guy's name?  Tony, right?  The spirit, Tony?  

Steve	Tony.  

Steve	Grab us a beer.  

Steve	Nice ass, Tony.  

Steve	Matt.  

Steve	He's getting me a beer.  

	
Jemma	Do the washing up.  

Steve	Tony. 

Jemma	Ok Matt, it's not funny now.  

Steve	Dude?  Mate, if you've got a knife I'm seriously gonna fuck you up.  

Steve	What's he got? 

Jemma	He's got a fucking knife.  

Steve	Has he got me a beer?  Ah Jem, Jem, take this, take this, take this.  

Jemma	I don't know what he's doing now.  
Steve	Matt?  


Steve	Mte, bravo, that's fantastic, but if you come any closer I'm gonna fucking karate chop you.  

Steve	You're a dickhead.  You're such a wanker, man.  What you doing that for? 

Jemma	That was… 

Matt	You should have heard yourself. 

Jemma	I actually believed you for a second then.  Honestly.  That was really convincing.  
  
Matt	Oh.

Jemma	Oh.  
Steve	I thought by buying a Ouija board and spurring the guys on to stir the pot we'd get some sort of spirit action going and absolutely nothing has happened.  I'm so ready to be scared.  Come on.  
 
Steve	Scare me.  

Steve	Just check in there.  
Jemma	No.  

Steve	He's probably just gone to get a coffee or something.  

Jemma	Mm.  

Steve	It's not an anniversary or something and he's gone to get you a gift or something?  Because he forgot?  
	
Jemma	No.  And he always forgets anyway.  

Jemma	I'll just have to wait until he gets back then I suppose.  

Steve	Well fuck it then.  

Steve	Are you alright?  

Jemma	Yeah, yeah.  

Steve	Ok. 

Steve	What the fuck is he doing? 	

Jemma	What?  Should I wake him up?  

Jemma	Matt?  You ok?  You alright?  

Steve	It's alright, mate.  

Matt	Fucking hell.  

Jemma	What you doing out here?  

Matt	Dunno, what? 

Steve	You alright, bud?  

Matt	Let's get...  

Jemma	ou alright?  

Steve	Yeah come in, come in.  

Matt	Fucking hell. 

Jemma	What happened?  

Matt	Dunno.  

Matt	Have you been filming me walking around again?  

Steve	No, mate we've just found you, we've just been looking for you.  

Jemma	We just found you. I'll get you some paracetamol?  


Matt	Can you turn that off please?  

Steve	We've just been looking for you.  

Matt	Fucking hell.

Steve	Mate, relax, relax.  

Steve		Are you alright?  

Matt	No, I feel like shit actually.  

Steve	Mate, your eyes look like shit.  

Matt	Was I walking around again last night? 

Steve	You must have been. 

Jemma	You ok?  

Steve	You're the wild card.  

Jemma	You ok?  

Matt	Not really.  Fucking hell.  

Steve	Mate, I don't wanna be like, crass or owt, but any chance I could have the camera that's on you?  

Matt	No.  

Steve	Please? 

Matt	No can you just leave it for a second actually.  

Matt	I know this is really funny and everything, can you just not?  
	
Steve	Mate, I just wanna know which direction to send the cleaners.  
Matt	Look, I'm actually really tired and I've got a really fucking bad headache.  

Steve	Do you wanna get, do you want some pills, mate?  Or would you like…  

Jemma	Shall I make you a cup of tea?  

Matt	Oh do you know what, fuck off.  

Steve	

Jemma	I’ll get you a cup of tea?
 
Jemma	Matt?  

Steve	Ah Jem, we've got the mirror cam.  Check that out, check that out.  We could check the footage on that, we've got him anyway, we don't need it.  

Jemma	I just… 

Steve	What? 

Jemma	I don't even know how to work the fucking camera.  


Steve	I've got about three and a half hours of mirror and then nothing.  It just turns off.  

Jemma	I don't know why he would have turned it off.  

Steve	How about a little video diary, hey?  

Steve	Unrelated video diary, we'll call it.   

Steve	Do you like bananas?  

Jemma	Yes.  

Steve	Cats or dogs?  

Jemma	Dogs.  

Steve	What do horses eat?  

Jemma	Hay.  

Steve	What do gay horses eat?  Hay.  
Steve	I wish you didn't hate me right now, I've not done anything.  

Jemma	I don't hate you.  

Steve	Good afternoon.  

Steve	Afternoon, bro.  You alright?  How you feeling?  

Matt	Like shit.  

Steve	Did you watch the Go-Pro?  

Jemma	You did, didn't you?  

Matt	It's just me sleepwalking to the balcony.  

Steve	It's what?  

Matt	It's me sleepwalking to the balcony.  

Jemma	So why can't we see it?  

Matt	Why do you need to?  

Matt	You can stop staring now.  

Steve	Come on man, tell us something exciting.  What happened?  

Matt	You know what happened.  

Steve	I don't know what happened.  You're keeping it from me, where's the camera?  

Steve	I need it, man.  

Jemma	I'm gonna go and get it.  

Steve	Yeah, go for it.  Where is it?  Where is it?  
 
Jemma	I dunno, he's probably hidden it somewhere.  

Steve	You signed up for it, bro.  Dunno why you're being such a fucking mard ass.  

Matt	Can you not?  

Matt	What are you …doing?  

Jemma	Where have you put it?  Where have you hidden it?  

Matt	Can you just leave it?  

Jemma	Why?  What? 

Matt	I've told you what it was.  Can you just leave it?  

Steve	Alright, alright.  We'll get it from you later.  

Matt	Can you just point that somewhere else?  

Steve	Did you turn my, my mirror camera off?  

Steve	Did you see that happen?  


Matt	No.  

Steve	No?  It's not that big a deal, bro.  

Jemma	Yeah, if you turned it off it's not.  

Steve	I'm gonna have to stand here.   That’s fine. 

Matt	Which I didn't, I told you I didn't.  

Jemma	Is that why you don't want us to see the Go-Pro footage?  

Matt	No.  
Steve	Guess what.  

Matt	What?  


Steve	The circus is in town.  

Steve	Are we going out?  
Jemma	Suppose I better go and get changed then. 

Steve	Yeah, now you're allowed in.  

Jemma	In our bedroom. Our bedroom.  Just so you know.  

Matt	It's not funny, man.  

Steve	Mate, she's so pissed off at you. 
Matt	Can you stop pointing that at me, please?  

Steve	Alright.  

Matt	Do you wanna go out?  

Steve	Yeah man, let's go and get a beer.  

Matt	Let's go out then.  
Steve	Behind, behind.  Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go. 

Matt	Who's in my flat?  

Matt	If there is anyone in here… 

Steve	Ah shit, my cameras, 
Steve (cont)	my cameras.  I’ll get fucking destroyed.  

Matt	Look at the fucking state of this place.  

Steve	Oh my god, thank god.  

Steve	Mate, let's go, let's go, let's go.  

Matt	Get the fuck out of my bedroom.  

Steve	No?  

Steve	Mate, be careful, just be careful.  

Matt	No there's no one in there.  There's no one in there.  
Matt	Fucking thing.  We could've fucking got them.  If this has got…

Steve	Mate, be careful with it, be fucking careful with it.  

Matt	How do I, how do I work this thing?  Tell me now.  

Steve	On the back of it there's a switch, just turn it on, on button.  

Matt	Yes.  Right.  

Matt	It fucking stopped.  It fucking stopped.  

Steve	Well what am I supposed to do about that?   It keeps… 

Matt	Everything's the same and then it stops.  Everything is fine and then it stops.  
Matt	You have that thing up the whole fucking time and then the one moment we actually need it… 

Matt	I can't believe it wasn't recording then.  

Steve	Mate, I set it up before we set off.  I did.   

Matt	This has been a fucking waste of time, this is ridiculous.  

Steve	And I'm like, 90 percent sure I closed the fucking door.  

Matt	Look at the state of my flat!  

Matt	Has, have you had anything taken? Jem?  


Jemma	No.  

Matt	You alright, Jem? 

Jemma	Yeah.  You're shouting at each other.  
Matt	I'm so fucking annoyed, sorry, I'm so annoyed.  

Steve	Mate, mate, come here. 

Matt	What?   Oh…

Steve	Mate, come here, 
Steve (cont)	…come here.  

Matt	What?  Don't, don't.  

Steve	There's not a scratch on it.  

Matt	Is the door shut?  The door is shut, right?  
 
Steve	We weren't gonna win the challenge, you know, with a sleepwalking best friend, are we?  

Steve	This makes it real, this makes it, you know, this makes it proper.  

Steve	Guys, this could be it.  
Steve	Exhibit A, in our one million dollar paranormal challenge application video.  Mr James Randi, explain this.  

Steve	It was a peaceful day.  

Matt	Are we not done filming yet?  

Steve	We arrived back at our apartment, the door was ajar.  And everything was fucked.  Burglars, you ask?  No, Mr Randi, this is the work of spirits.  

Steve	The same spirits have fucked up my bedroom and played havoc on my best friend.  

Steve	He's started tidying up.  

Matt	Can you help now?  

Matt	Ok, so today was the worst day ever.  

Matt	So from now on I want to be 
Matt (cont)	…tooled up, so that if anything does go down we catch it.  
 
Matt	Whatever it is.  
 
Steve	Bravo.

Matt	Oh, hello.  I just wanna make sure we're covered.  We came in today and the mirror cam was off, so I want to make sure we've got maximum coverage, you know? 
 
Steve	Can I just ask you something?  

Matt	Yep. 

Steve	You're not gonna be all kind of selfish Jean on the footage, right?  If something goes down tonight on the Go-Pro I wanna see it in the morning.  

Matt	Yeah, but about that, if…I just wanna say that I'm gonna watch this first, yeah?  

Steve	Yeah, if it's embarrassing I don't need to know about it.  

Matt	I get that we all wanna watch it, but it is me and so I'm gonna watch it first.  

Steve	Ok, but don't be hiding no ghosties from me.  

Matt	Hey, if I see a ghost we're all a lot richer so...  

Steve	Promise?  

Matt	Yeah absolutely.  


Steve	Promise? 

Matt	Is the mirror cam on?  

Steve	No, witness it.  I'm gonna turn it on now.  

Matt	Get it on.  Fully charged it this time, right?  

Steve	Mate, it's been fully charged every night.  
Steve	Why did you never tell me you sleepwalked by the way?  

Matt	I dunno, didn't think it was worth mentioning.  

Steve	Show me the ghosties!  

Steve	Mate, what you doing?  

Matt	I'm just looking up.  

Steve	Why have you taken it down?  

Matt	Well I just remembered the stuff that we saw on the back and I wanna, just wanna have a look at it  

Steve	Well we could be missing something here pal, right now.   
Steve	What, what, you’re saying you're researching something?  


Matt	It's from 1923, the newspaper.  It's got from April 23rd to 27th and that's all I've got.  And nothing significant happened on those dates, before you ask.  

Steve	Ok.  What about the Go-Pro last night?  Anything?  

Matt	No.  

Steve	Did you sleepwalk?  

Matt	No.  
Steve	Did he get out of bed last night Jem?  

Jemma	I dunno, I was asleep.  

Steve	Motherfucker.  

Steve	Have any of you two touched mirror cam?  

Jemma	Why would we touch your mirror cam?  

Steve	No I'm just asking, none of you's touched it?  

Jemma	No.  

Steve	Mate you haven't like, on the Go-Pro seen yourself turn it off have you? 

Matt	No I told you I was asleep last night wasn't I?  Nothing happened. 

Steve	I'm sure it works just as good as that one.  

Steve	Look, can you see a red light, Jem?  

Jemma	Yeah.  

Steve	Red light.  

Matt	Yeah, the red light's on now and it's always on, but maybe it turned itself off.  Maybe the battery's broken.  

Steve	It doesn't, the battery lasts eight hours.  

Matt	Well maybe it's the memory card then.  
Steve	64 gig.  

Matt	Maybe there's something wrong with the internal wiring that you don't understand.  

Steve	No, the camera's working.  


Matt	Look, I don't know what your problem is with taking it to someone who knows what they're talking about.  

Steve	No, it's not broken.

Matt	Just go and have it fixed.  

Steve	Matty, it's a good thing.  
Steve (cont)	It's unexplainable.  

Steve	I can't explain why it's not working.  

Steve	At night time only that's it, it just switches off.  And if it's not you and it's not you...  

Steve	It's the mirror.  

Steve	The mirror's turning it off.  Mirror trashed our flat, mirror's making him sleepwalk, mirror turned my camera off.  It's a good thing. 

Steve	What?  We're onto something. 

Steve	Is he not getting laid?  I don't understand.  

Matt	Can you shut up?  

Jemma	Oh fuck off, Steve.  

Steve	I don't understand, because seriously he's in such a grumpy mood.  
Steve (cont)	Listen, I'm gonna go out of the flat for an hour.  

Matt	Good.  

Steve	I suggest you guys get it on or something, because seriously the atmosphere around here is deadly.  

Steve	I don't know about you guys, right, but since we got this mirror I've had really bad toothache. 

Steve	Have you?  
Steve	Jem?  

Jemma	Yeah? 


Steve	What would you do, right, if a ghost just came and sat down next to you?  

Jemma	Dunno.  Freak out.  What would you do?  

Steve	You what?  

Jemma	If a ghost came and sat down next to you?  

Steve	I'd film it and win this competition.  

Steve	You know what would be great, if every one of them 

Steve (cont)	…spotlights just fell down now.  

Jemma	Why would that be great?  

Steve	I dunno, it'd be great wouldn't it?  It'd be creepy.  

Steve	Mate, go easy on the aubergines.  

Steve	You alright, mate?  

Jemma	Matt?  

Steve	What's wrong?  What?  

Steve	Jem?  

Jemma	Yeah?  

Steve	Look at these.  

Jemma	Look at what?  

Steve	What do you mean, it's a massacre.  I mean, my little sister can chop shit better than that, look what he's done.  

Jemma	Matt, please talk to me.  

Jemma	Steve, Steve!  Wake up!  

Steve	What?  What is it?  What is it?  

Jemma	He's got a knife.  
Steve	Who's got a knife?  

Jemma	Who do you think?  Matt's got a 

Jemma (cont)	…fucking knife.  

Steve	Move away, move away.  

Jemma	Steve, be careful.  Be careful.  Be careful.  

Steve	I'll be alright.  I'll be alright.  I'll be alright.  

Steve	Fucking hell.  

Steve	Matt?  

Steve	Matty?  

Steve	Oh my god.  He's not here.  

Jemma	What?  

Steve	Oh my god.  

Jemma	Is he not in there anymore?  

Steve	No, just stay there, stay there, stay there.  Fucking idiot.  Where is he?  

Jemma	He’s…

Steve	He's in bed. 

Jemma	What?  

Steve	He's in bed.  

Steve	What are you talking about?  

Jemma	What do you mean what am I talking about?  


Steve	Well were you dreaming or what?  He's in bed.  

Jemma	Oh, you never take me seriously, do you Steve?  

Matt	Alright no, alright, alright.  

Jemma	Why would I just make up that he had a fucking knife in the kitchen?  

Steve	I'm sorry, alright.  Let's get out of here.  Get out of here.  

Steve	Fucking hell.  

Steve	Look, listen.  Just stay in here, stay in here.  I'll sleep near the door and I just, just won't let him in.  


Matt	Hello?  

Matt	You up?  

Steve	Yeah, yeah, hold the phone.  
Matt	What?  

Steve	Hold the phone. 

Matt	Why are you sat in front of the door?  

Steve	Frankly pal, we're a touch nervous.  

Matt	Can you open it? 

Steve	Yeah, will you just confirm you've got nothing on you?  

Matt	What?  

Steve	I don't, I don’t even know what to say here.  
Matt	What the hell?

Steve	Mate, I don't even know where to start.  

Matt	Are you alright? 

Steve	Just leave her mate, just leave it, leave it.  

Matt	Ok, what?  

Steve	I'm not even gonna mention the fact that you're not allowed in the kitchen anymore.  

Matt	Shh, shh.  

Jemma (Video Clip)	Steve, Steve!  Wake up!  

Steve (Video Clip)	What?  What is it?  What is it?  

Jemma (Video Clip)	He's got a knife.  

Steve (Video Clip)	Who’s got a knife? 

Jemma (Video Clip)	Who do you think?  Matt's got a fucking knife.  

Steve (Video Clip)	Move away, move away.  

Jemma (Video Clip)	Steve, be careful.  Be careful.  Be careful.  

Steve (Video Clip)	I'll be alright.  I'll be alright.  I'll be alright.  

Steve	Don't go out of your way to apologise, alright pal?  

Matt	It's not like I did it on purpose, is it? 
Jemma	We can't have you walking around with knives in your hand.  

Matt	No.  Are you really filming this?  

Steve		Might be good to just go over it, you know what I mean, after we've won.  We'll laugh at it.  

Matt	It's not really that funny is it?  Me standing around with knives?  

Steve	We're not laughing now pal.  No.  

Matt	And you guys just leaving me there.  

Steve	It was deadly serious. 


Matt	Yeah, it was.  

Matt	And what, I do that and you just go to sleep?  

Jemma	No, he came and got all the knives out of the kitchen.  

Steve	Yeah we had a really nice peaceful night's sleep, what the fuck are you talking about?  

Matt	Great, good for you.  

Steve	Did we heck?  I slept in a sleeping bag, it was mouldy.  

Matt	How did you know I wasn't gonna get up again?  

Steve	We're not gonna watch you all night, pal.  

Matt	Well it seems like you ought to.  

Jemma	Have you got the footage from your Go-pro?  Maybe you can watch what you did next?  

Steve	Have you watched the Go-Pro this morning?  

Steve	Have you?  I don't understand why you're being so mysterious all of a sudden.  

Matt	Because I'm… 

Steve	We're not hiding anything from you, pal.  We're telling you straight up, there's a video of you with a knife last night.  

Matt	Yeah and then you went to bed and you left me there, who knows to do what next.  

Jemma	He came and got the knives from the kitchen and you were gone.  

Matt	Yeah but it's not just the knives is it, it could be anything.  

Jemma	So what, do you want us to lock you in a room?  

Matt	Yeah!  

Steve	We can't be doing that.  

Matt	That's what I would have done if it was one of you guys.  

Steve	Look, I made sure you were safe and sound.  

Matt	No you didn't, you just left me there.  

Steve	I didn't mate, you've no idea what I did.  

Matt	But you've seen me wake up outside on the balcony, one more step and I'm off it.  I come back to the kitchen to I don’t know, turn on all the hobs, burn myself.  There's plenty of other sharp objects apart from ucking knives.  There's a billion ways I could hurt myself in this flat.  

Steve	No. 

Jemma	You were asleep on the bed when we came back.  He got the knives.  

Matt	Yeah, but what if I get up again?  

Steve	I moved one of your arms because it looked uncomfortable.  

Matt	Great.  That's kind of not what I'm worried about.  

Steve	I'm still not clear on if you're supposed to wake up people sleepwalking or not.  I'm not.  

Matt	You are just a million miles away from understanding what it's like to be me right now.  

Steve	I'm being really understanding, I thought.  

Matt	No you're not.  

Steve	I think I'm the calmest one here.  

Jemma	I don't really think you're taking this seriously.  I mean, am I the only person that cares that he was stood there with a knife?  

Steve	I am taking it…

Steve	I went out for him!  

Matt	Well I'd like to believe that.  

Steve	I went out for him!  

Jemma	Yeah and you're just cracking jokes left, right and centre, it's a serious situation, Steve.  I'm fucking in your room scared shitless, you clearly don't give a shit, he's more concerned about himself.  

Matt	Yes, I am concerned about myself.  

Steve	Listen, whoa.  We've got neighbours.  Well let's be honest, you sleepwalking is probably the best thing we've got in this application, isn't it?  

Steve (cont) 	Listen, if I was sleepwalking… 

Matt	Is that what you want?  Do you want me to go and do loads of crazy shit on camera for you?  Alright, you've seen me pissing on the floor, that's really funny, do you want me to piss on the camera?  Do you want me to piss on your face?  

Steve	What are you talking about?  

Matt	Do you want me to go in the kitchen again, get a load of knives out, stab myself, cut my wrists, slit my throat, bathe the whole fucking place in my blood, would that be really good for you?  Is that what you wanna send?  

Steve	Look at your distraught girlfriend who's in the kitchen wondering what the fuck went down last night.  


Jemma	What are we gonna do, Matt?  

Jemma	What are you suggesting that we do?  

Steve	 think we need a bit of a group hug or something just to fucking… 

Steve	Alright, stop it.  

Matt	Stop pointing it at me, turn it off.  

Matt	If you don't switch that thing off I'm gonna throw it off the balcony and you along with it.  

Steve	He's here.  

Steve	I knew you'd remember, mate.  I knew it, it's quiz night, right?  Matt?  

Steve	You've remembered, haven't you?  

Jemma	He's gonna ignore us.  Cool, brilliant.  

Steve	Mate, come on.  

Jemma	Hey, no, I need my charger.  Matt, I need my charger.  I need my charger.  For fuck's sake.  
Jemma	Fine, I won't charge my phone.  

Steve	I don't know what to suggest.  Matt?  

Steve	Matt, Jemma's got her boobs out.  

Steve	She's dancing with her boobs out.  

Steve	We could get all my deodorant, smoke him out underneath the door.  

Steve	Like a fox, just smoke him out.  

Jemma	What if we turned off the electricity?  Then he wouldn't be able to watch his laptop.  

Matt	There you go.  

Steve	We could tell him like, tonight's the only night he can see Neptune and he has to get his telescope out and look at Neptune. 

Jemma	We could pretend we were having sex.  

Steve	No he'd just come out and kill us, that wouldn't be the best.  

Steve	Or you could tell him, I could tell him that you've left him, that you've just gone.  

Jemma	I don't think he'd care, Steve.  

Steve	Oh come on, of course he'd care.  

Jemma	No, I really don't think he would.  

Steve	Of course he would.  Don't say that.  

Steve	He's just, he’s just in a bad mood.  

Steve	Of course he'd care.  Of course he would.  Stupid.  

Steve	Come out you fucker.  
 
Steve	Matthew!  

Steve	Yes.  

Steve	Jem, Jem, it's Matt.  He's trying to fucking get in.   Fuck.  
 
Jemma	What if he's got a knife, Steve?  

Steve	Fuck.  Jem, let's move this thing.  

Jemma	What?  

Steve	Let's just move the bedside table.  

Steve	Oh fuck, fuck.  Matt?  

Steve	Go away!  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Fuck.  Fuck, what was that?  What is that?  Matt!  Matty boy. 

Steve (cont)	Oh shit, oh shit.  Fuck, fuck, what was that?  What is that?  Matt?  Matty boy?  Oh fuck.  Fuck, why is he fucking doing this?  Matt?  

Steve	Jem.  

Matt	Argh!  

Steve	His door's open.  

Jemma	Shh.  

Jemma	Where the fuck has he been?  

Steve	We're gonna have to start locking him in from this side of the door.  

Jemma	How can we lock him from this side of the door?  How?  

Steve	I don’t know…

Jemma	The door opens that way.  Ah! 

Steve	Jesus on wheels!  


Jemma	Oh my god, that just scared the shit out of me.  

Steve	Oh my god.  

Jemma	Ah! 

Steve	It's alright, it's alright, I've got you.  Oh my god.  

Steve	No.  

Steve	No!  For fuck's sake.  You… 
Steve	It was him.  How many times did I fucking ask him did he turn it off?  No he didn't.  Matt, get out here now, mate.  Get out you fucking liar.  "I didn't turn it off.”  Yeah you did, you little prick.  Fucking knew it!  You lying son of a bitch!  Open this door pal, right now!  

Steve	Is that Matt?  

Steve	He's having a shower.  

Jemma	Yeah?  

Steve	He's having a shower.  Yeah let's go and get it.  

Jemma	Let's go get the Go-Pro.  

Steve	Yeah, the Go-Pro.  

Jemma	Fuck.  

Jemma	Steve, Steve!  

Steve	Show me, show me. 

Jemma	What the fuck would he have done with it?  

Jemma	Check it. 

Steve	Holy shit.  Matt.  Matt, Matt, you alright?  Matt, what's going on?  Matt?  

Jemma	Matt.  Matt?  Oh fuck. 

Matt	I can’t see. 

Jemma	Look at his eyes, Steve.  Look at his eyes.  

Steve	What do you mean? 

Matt	I can't see.  

Steve	Holy shit. 

Jemma	Are you, you ok?  

Matt	I can't see anything. 

Jemma	Matt?  

Steve	Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.  

Jemma	Matt? 	 Matt?  

Steve	What can't you see?  Can you see this?  Can you see that?  

Matt	I can't see anything!  

Steve	Can you see that?  

Matt	I can't see anything!  

Jemma	Matt, do you want some water?  

Steve	Hey buddy.  

Jemma	Please have some water.  

Steve	You need to try and close them if you can, Matt.  Just rest up.  

Jemma	He won't eat, he won't drink.  

Steve	If you need anything mate, just, just let us know alright?  

Steve	Be back in a minute pal, don't worry.  

Jemma	I don't know what to do.  

Steve	It's alright.  

Jemma	It's not ok, Steve.  He can't see, he's not eaten, he's not drank anything, he's just sat in bed.  We don't even know where he's been, what he's been up to, what's happened to him.  

Steve	At least he's not freaking out, he's calm, he just needs to rest his eyes, he just needs to calm down.  

Jemma	He can't see, this is serious.  

Steve	It might start coming back, I don’t know.  Need to do something, I think maybe you should suggest that he needs to get some help.  Go in and ask him.  

Jemma	Fine.  

Steve	Just do it calmly.  

Jemma	Fuck it.  

Steve	Don't freak out.  You've got to stay clam for him.  

Jemma	Matt?  Matt.  

Matt	Get out.  

Steve	Mate, you need to get back in bed pal.  

Jemma	Matt?  

Matt	Get out.  

Jemma	Matt, let's get you back into bed.  

Matt	Get out.  

Jemma	Let's get back into bed.  Let’s get you back into bed.  Matt, please get…fine! 

Matt	Get out.  Get out.  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  

Steve	We're out,

Steve (cont)	…we're out, we're out.  Fuck. 

Jemma	Oh.  

Jemma	Why?  

Jemma	I know you can hear me.  

Jemma	Please come out.  

Jemma	Please.  

Jemma	Matt, I love you, please come out.  

Steve	Well if he's not out by tomorrow we'll get him some help.   Yeah? 

Steve	Do you want me to go first?  

Jemma	Yeah.  

Steve	Check in there.  

Jemma	Steve? 

Steve	Yeah?  What?  

Jemma	Your camera's on the floor.  

Jemma (cont)	There's blood on the camera.  

Jemma	There.  

Steve	Holy shit.  

Steve (cont)	He's taken my memory cards out, Jem.  

Steve	Fuck, he's taken the cards.  
Jemma	Steve, he's gone.  

Jemma	He's gone.  

Lady on TV	I wanted to be there for Lucas, as a friend.  I didn't know he still had those feelings.  

Steve	Thank you very much, yeah.  Wonderful.  Bye, bye.  

Jemma	Still nothing?  

Steve	Fucking pointless.  

Steve	They’ve not heard anything. 
 
Steve (cont)	And even if he was just wandering the streets blind, right, someone's gonna just say, "excuse me, you look blind.  Do you want a fucking hand," or something.  

Jemma	Yeah.  Unless he's lying in a ditch.  

Steve	He's not lying in a ditch.  Just stop being so grim about it.  Just stop it, like.  

Jemma	Stop being grim?  

Steve	Well he's not lying in a fucking ditch, is he? 

Jemma	He could be lying in a ditch, Steve.  That's the reality of what's happened.  

Steve	Why?  

Jemma	Because he can't see anything.  

Steve	Right, well if I was blind I'm just gonna go oh, there's a ditch, I'm just gonna fucking lie in it?  No, you power on.  You power through if you're in a fucking struggle.  
	Steve
	And he's not sleepwalking now, he must have come round.  
Steve	You can't fucking sleepwalk for that long.  Someone's found him and he's safe and he's fine and maybe he just can't fucking communicate or something, he's just… 

Steve	Maybe he just needs a break from all this fucking mirror shit.  

Steve	I told him if he couldn't handle it he didn't have to fucking do it.  

Steve	You've done better than he has.  

Matt (Video Clip)	…bad luck to start with.  

Jemma (Video Clip)	Great.  

Matt (Video Clip)	Alright, be easy.  

Steve	You need to see this.  	

Jemma	You found something?  

Steve	You won't believe it.  

Steve	It's the second we opened the mirror. 

Jemma	Oh Steve, I don't wanna watch this.  

Steve	What?  No, no, no, Jem, just watch it.  

Jemma	I don't wanna watch this. 

Steve	Jem please, just watch this.  

Jemma	Is this a fucking joke?  

Steve	I'm not joking, no.  Jem, I know it's upsetting, I'm sorry, but you need to see this.  Jem, Jem, just watch.  Just watch.  The second you guys open the mirror, the second, what does Matt do?  

Jemma	What? 

Steve	He rubs his eyes, Jem.  

Steve (cont) 	The fucking second the mirror arrives his eyes got fucked up, right?  

Steve	And I've got it on tape, the first fucking bit of proof that connects to him going a bit weird.  He starts rubbing his eyes straight away.  

Jemma	Steve, you've got him rubbing his eye.  

Steve	Yeah, Jem, it's the second he fucking opens the thing.  

Jemma	It doesn't prove anything, Steve.  

Steve	It's better than nothing, Jem.  It's better than nothing.  He's gone, he's gone missing, he's dead, let’s just, yeah, let's just go to bed, he's dead.  Matt's dead.  Forget about it.  Yeah, he's just got sore eyes.  
	
Steve	Oh Jem.  

Steve	Come here.  Come here.  

Steve	It's ok, it's alright.  

Steve	Come here.  What are you doing?  


Jemma	I miss him, Steve.  

Jemma	I'll go to bed.  

Steve	Jem?  

Steve	What does that say?  

Steve	It fucking says his name.  

Steve	Jem, the mirror chose him.  

Jemma	It's a mirror.  It can't choose people, Steve.  

Steve	It chose him.  I don't know what else to say, it's his name on the back.  He’s chosen. 

Jemma	No it doesn't mean that he got chosen by a mirror, that's ridiculous.  

Jemma	No, no he's coming back.  It's nothing to do with the mirror.  

Jemma	I think we should cover it up, I think we should put something over it.  It just makes me feel uncomfortable.  

Steve	It's gone.  Alright?  Out of sight, out of mind, just forget about it, just…

Steve	We'll just have to wait until he comes back.  

Jemma	I think it's Matt.  

Steve	Holy shit,

Steve (cont)	…I'll go get him, I'll go get him.  

Steve	Matt?  Matt?  

Steve	There's no one there.  

Steve	There's no one there.  

Steve	Fuck a duck.  

Jemma	I think I've heard Matt. 

Steve	What? 

Jemma	I think I've heard Matt.  

Steve	Where abouts?  Where abouts?  
Steve (cont)	He's in the flat?  
 
Jemma	I heard a man's voice.  

Steve	Matt?  Matty?  

Steve	There's nothing here, Jem.  

Jemma	Gone.  

Jemma	He's gone.  

Steve	Are you dreaming?  

Jemma	Agh!  

Steve	Jemma? 

Jemma	Steve.  Agh!  

Steve	Jem?  Jem it's me.  



Steve	What are you doing?  

Steve	Oh my god.  Jem?  What are you doing?  Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me.  Give it to me.  I’ve got it.  It's ok, it's ok, it's ok.  I'll be back in a second.  
 

Steve	Fucking hell.  Shit.  

Steve	It's ok, it's ok, it's ok.  

Steve	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  

Jemma	I'm going to bed.  

Steve	Ok.  I'll sort that, I'll sort that.  

Jemma	Thanks.  

Steve	Thank you.  

Steve	Hello?  

Steve	Sorry, were you asleep?  No?  

Steve	How are you doing?  

Steve	Alright?  

Jemma	Yeah.  

Steve	Ah, it's just coming away there.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, it was just coming away.  

Steve	You gonna be alright by yourself, yeah? 

Steve	Ok?  Sleep well.  

Steve	I'm gonna turn the lights out, yeah?  Night, night. 

Jemma	Night.  

Steve	See you in the morning.  

Steve	What the fuck?  Fuck, fucking hell.  What the fuck?  

Steve	Matt?  

Steve	Matt is that you?  

Steve	Mate, I never thought I’d…I didn’t think I'd be seeing you again.  

Steve	I'm so sorry about all this, mate.  

Steve	I don't mind that you scratched me.  

Steve	Fucking hell pal, what's wrong with your hands?  

Steve	Matt, where's Jem?  

Steve	Jem?  Jemma?  

Steve	Jemma!  

Steve	Fuck.  Jem. 

Steve	What have you done?  

Steve	I'm going fucking crazy.  

Steve	Jemma!  

Steve	Jemma?  

Steve	Jem?  

Steve	Jemma?  

Steve	Where are you?  

Steve	Oh god.  


Steve	Oh, fuck.  

Steve	Here we go.  

Steve	Jemma?  

Steve	This can't be happening.  

Steve	Jem?  

Steve	Jemma!
