Mi-jung	Lights went out in the theater, and the audience disappeared… And then…

Producer	Any progress?

Mi-jung	Not yet.

Producer	That horror idea we had, centering around a theater.

Producer	matter if it’s a ghost or a killer, just put together a story.

Mi-jung	Give me two weeks.

Producer	I sometimes wonder nowadays, if I’m working with a newbie or an auteur.

Producer	I’ll give you two weeks, but this is your last chance.

Producer	If you can’t give him anything by the end of the month, both of us are out.

Producer	We brought in a film fest prodigy, but development expenses pile up, and get nothing in return. You sure you can have something ready?

Mi-jung	Yes.

Producer	I believe in you.

Mi-jung 	Okay. I don’t like that story.

Joon-seo	Yeah?

Mi-jung	Got anything else?

Joon-seo	I’m not so sure about this one…

Mi-jung	Come on, spill it.

Joon-seo 	A friend heard it from a neighborhood friend.

Joon-seo 	There was a graduation screening for the film majors at his college, and half of the people ran out of the theater, and one died of heart attack.

Mi-jung	What was it about?

Joon-seo 	Well… The student who made it was investigated, and he said it was made by a ghost.

Mi-jung 	A film made by a ghost?

Joon-seo 	Yes.

Mi-jung	What’s the title?

Joon-seo 	He didn’t tell me.

Mi-jung	How many years ago?

Joon-seo 	I don’t…

Mi-jung	 Can you get in touch with him?

Joon-seo	I’ve lost touch with him. Actually, I just heard that he majored film at Daejeon University.

Mi-jung	Daejeon University, film major.

Daejeon 	Bus Terminal

Professor	 Who are you?

Mi-jung	Hello.  Are you Prof. Jo Mi-kyung?

Professor	So you directed that short film.

Professor	What brings you here?

Mi-jung	Didn’t a student make a horror film as his final project?

Professor 	There are a few students who shoot genre films.

Mi-jung	The student claimed that it was made by a ghost.

Professor 	What’s the title?

Mi-jung	I don’t know the title…

Professor 	Which year?

Mi-jung 	I don’t know that…

Professor 	So you came all the way on a rumor about a ghost-shot film?

Mi-jung 	You really don’t know?

Professor 	This year marks my 10th year as a professor here, I’ve heard of no such thing.

Mi-jung	Perhaps it was over 10 years ago.

Professor 	The film department here started 10 years ago.

Professor 	Unfortunately, you wasted your time.

Producer 	If you can’t give him anything by the end of the month, both of us are out. This is your last chance.

Sung-tae	The more I watch Nolan’s films, the more amazed I am.

Jung-min 	Who cares about Nolan?

Sung-tae 	Your shorts are so dull because you don’t accept Nolan.

Jung-min 	Don’t talk about my stuff.

Sung-tae 	Always guessing and shit.

Jung-min	But you don’t like ‘Sicario’, ‘Arrival’…

Sung-tae	Dude, tell him about Nolan.

Jung-min 	You ruined your short by working with Nam and wasted $30,000.

Sung-tae 	You can’t talk about Nolan like that.

Mi-jung 	Are you… Daejeon U film majors?

Kyung-sik 	Yes, we are.

Mi-jung 	Shall we play a game?

Jung-min 	What game?

Mi-jung	Tell me a scary story. Take a shot if it’s not scary.

Kyung-sik 	If it is scary…

Mi-jung	If it’s really scary, I’ll grant you a wish.

Kyung-sik 	A wish?

1. ???? ??
Like anything?

Mi-jung	FYI, 10 brownie points if it’s a real life event, and 20 points, if it’s about this school.

Kyung-sik 	This school? Our school?

Sung-tae 	Miss.

Mi-jung	Okay, Sung-tae, you first.

Sung-tae	This is something I heard from my senior, there’s an abandoned theater near our campus.  An actress named Soon-mi was burned to death while making a film and became a ghost.

Sung-tae	She did…

Mi-jung	Take a shot.

Jung-min 	Take a shot!

Jung-min	Drink it man! Shot! Shot!

Mi-jung	Who’s next?

Jung-min	Me! Me!

Mi-jung 	Sure, Jung-min.

Jung-min	This was 10 years ago. A film student made a horror film as a graduation film. You know those graduation screenings? I heard his film was so scary.

Jung-min	People passed out and someone died of heart attack.

Mi-jung 	That scary?

Jung-min 	Do you know what the director said?

Jung-min	He claims he didn’t make the film.

Jung-min	But a ghost made it.

Mi-jung 	A ghost made it? How?

Jung-min 	The crew were waiting to shoot in an abandoned theater, and the ghost appeared and snapped their arms, then twisted their necks, and she was killing them…

Sung-tae	I was trying to tell you about her story, too. Soon-mi.

Mi-jung	Sung-tae, don’t interrupt Jung-min’s story.

Jung-min 	Right!

Sung-tae 	It’s because I know more about this story. The ghost asked him what kind of film he wanted to make, he said he wanted to make the scariest film ever. So the ghost knocked him out… I’m talking here, you stupid nerd! Let go! I bit my tongue!

Kyung-sik 	Guys! How could you fight in front of her!

Sung-tae 	I bit my tongue!

Jung-min 	You deserve it!

Kyung-sik 	Mi-jung.

Kyung-sik	What happened afterwards is very important.

Kyung-sik	What I mean is,

Kyung-sik	The film ‘Warning’ was accepted to a film festival.

Sung-tae 	Serious?

Kyung-sik 	Yeah, Bucheon Fantastic Film Festival.

Mi-jung	A film made by a ghost, ‘Warning’…

Mi-jung	Bucheon Fantastic Film Festival…

Mi-jung’s fat	Mi-jung! Park Mi-jung! Can you open up? Park Mi-jung! Open this door! Mi-jung! Mi-jung!

Mr. Kang	Mi-jung!

Mr. Kang	It’s been a while, did you get here okay?

Mi-jung	Yeah, sorry to drop by out of the blue.

Mr. Kang 	No worries, so what’s up?

Mi-jung 	I wanted to check out a film that was screened here.

Mr. Kang 	Yeah? Follow me.

Mr. Kang	A 10-year-old submission called ‘Warning’?

Mi-jung 	Yes.

Mr. Kang 	How did you know about this film?

Mi-jung 	I’ll tell you later.

Mr. Kang	Found it.

Mr. Kang 	This film was selected but got cancelled.

Mi-jung 	Are there any files left?

Mr. Kang	Well, I’ll have to open it.

Mi-jung	Then open it.

Mr. Kang 	I can’t do anything about films in the archive.

Mr. Kang 	Don’t worry, I’ll contact my colleague about it.

Mr. Kang	Hold on, I got your back.

Mr. Kang	Mr. Kim.

Mr. Kang	A friend of mine would like to see a film in the archive.

Mr. Kang	Is it possible to screen it?

Mr. Kang	Yes, the title is ‘Warning.’

Mr. Kang 	It says the screening was cancelled.

Mr. Kang 	Oh, that’s ‘Warning’?

Mr. Kang	My friend?

Mr. Kang	I’ll ask her where she heard about it.

Mr. Kang 	No, of course not.

Mr. Kang	I’m sorry, and thank you.

Mr. Kang 	I mean, sorry, I’m so sorry…

Mr. Kang	Sorry, that call… Where did she go?

Mi-jung	If you leave now,

Mi-jung	I’ll post it again.

Jae-hyun	Born 1988, Sangdo district #423, Director Park Mi-jung.

Jae-hyun	Listen to my warning.

Jae-hyun	Don’t shed tears of regret when it’s too late.

Mi-jung	‘Warning’

Jae-hyun	Soon-mi… ‘Warning’… Abandoned theater… It can’t happen again. Shit, I should’ve burned it all. Piss off. I said piss off! What do you want from me?! Just tell me! I’m going nuts…

Jae-hyun	Who are you? Who the hell are you?

Mi-jung	I’m… sorry… I was just curious…

Jae-hyun	What?

Jae-hyun 	I doubt that. Where did you find this?

Jae-hyun	Now I get it.

Jae-hyun	You’re trying to make a film by editing this.

Jae-hyun	Soon-mi in that theater… No…

Jae-hyun	It can’t happen again.

Jae-hyun	It can’t!

Mi-jung	No!

Jae-hyun	No!

Mi-jung	Please!

Jae-hyun	You know what’s more horrifying than death?

Jae-hyun	Living in horror.

Jae-hyun	That’s the scariest film of all time.

Jae-hyun	If you end up like me,

Jae-hyun	you’re better off dead.

Mi-jung	Shit, he’s crazy…

Jae-hyun	No, no…

Joon-seo	Mi-jung, what’s wrong?

Joon-seo	I think it’s been formatted.

Mi-jung	What?

Mi-jung 	No, I risked my life to bring this here…

Joon-seo	Mi-jung…

Mi-jung	 Try again.

Mi-jung 	No… no…

Joon-seo	Mi-jung!

Mi-jung	What are you watching?

Joon-seo	Mi-jung!

Joon-seo	Are you okay?

Mi-jung	Hard drive, what happened to it?

Joon-seo	I’m running a data recovery software.

Joon-seo 	I recovered one file so far.

Mi-jung	Yeah? Let’s see.

Actress	Who… are you…

Jae-hyun	Cut! That’s it!

Actress	Thank you!

Jae-hyun	Great work.

Ji-su	 	That was great.

Mi-jung	Move aside.

Ji-su		We’ll contact you in two days at the latest.

Actress	Thank you, good bye.

Jae-hyun	Take care!

Young-min 	Take care!

Ji-su		How was she?

Young-min	She seems pretty good to me.

Young-min	She has the right look for a horror film.

Jae-hyun 	I didn’t like her, her frown was…

Jae-hyun	No, something’s missing.

Ji-su		DP, how was she?

Gwang-bae 	I’m more concerned about doing the audition without a script.

Ji-su		Jae-hyun, when do we get your script?

Jae-hyun	Hold on for a bit, it’s almost done.

Joon-seo	It looks like a making-of video.

Gwang-bae	Why do you want to make films?

Jae-hyun	Me?

Jae-hyun	To make horror films.

Gwang-bae	Why horror?

Jae-hyun	There was a horror film that saved my life.

Gwang-bae	A horror film saved you?

Jae-hyun	Don’t you want to know how it saved me?

Jae-hyun	I had a tough time in high school.

Jae-hyun	I was actually bullied badly.

Jae-hyun	I was beaten daily, and wanted to kill myself.

Jae-hyun	I was hospitalized more than my time in school.

Jae-hyun	One day, ‘The Exorcist’ was playing on TV.

Jae-hyun	You know, the scariest film ever made.

Jae-hyun	I couldn’t take my eyes off it.

Jae-hyun	My hands were shaking, and tears rolled down my face…

Jae-hyun	It felt like my heart was beating again.
 
Jae-hyun	It was terrifying… but the pain suddenly went away.

Jae-hyun	That’s when I made up my mind, I wanted to make a horror film that can help someone forget about their pain.

Mi-jung	Eh? Power outage? 

Mi-jung	When did we first meet?

Joon-seo	I was assistant director on your first short film.

Joon-seo	So, 10 years ago.

Mi-jung 	Thanks for staying by a selfish gal like me.

Joon-seo	Come on.

Joon-seo	When I look at you…

Joon-seo	I’m envious.

Joon-seo	You’re really cool.

Joon-seo	You live each day for your dream.

Mi-jung	Dream I’m just crazy, I really am.

Joon-seo	By the way… I actually read your script.

Joon-seo	I’m sorry.

Mi-jung	How was it?

Joon-seo	What?

Mi-jung	How was the script?

Joon-seo 	It was good, it was but… the protagonist was exactly like you…

Mi-jung	And her friend’s like you, right?

Joon-seo	Do I talk that much?

Mi-jung	Anyway, that script is a work of fiction.

Joon-seo	Okay. What happens to the director and her friend in the end?

Mi-jung	In the end? It’s a horror film, so definitely not a happy ending.

Jae-hyun	Okay. This place would look dope at night.

Jae-hyun	Just a bit further. It’s exactly how I imagined it, it’s perfect.

Jae-hyun	Very nice.

Gwang-bae	So we’re shooting a fake doc like ‘The Blair Witch Project’?

Jae-hyun	The story goes like this.

Jae-hyun	College students invite a friend to an abandoned theater, and shoot him freaking out, and a real ghost appears.

Young-min	Do we have to star in it?

Jae-hyun	Yeah, maybe.

Ji-su		Just decide.

Jae-hyun	I’ll look around and decide one by one.

Jae-hyun	This is amazing.

Gwang-bae	Come on, man.

Jae-hyun	I’m sorry.

Jae-hyun	What was that?


Jae-hyun	Holy cow… Isn’t this place amazing?

Jae-hyun	Incredible…

Gwang-bae	Are we skipping lunch?

Gwang-bae	Where are you going?

Jae-hyun	Just looking around.

Jae-hyun	So awesome…

Jae-hyun	Who are you?

Jae-hyun	Film, world’s scariest film…

Mi-jung	Who is he talking to?

Jae-hyun	World’s scariest…

Ji-su		I’m sorry, Gwang-bae.

Gwang-bae	Why are you apologizing?

Ji-su		Wasn’t there a rumor that this place is haunted?

Young-min	Yeah, I heard that.

Young-min	Ghost of a burned actress. Her name is Soon-mi.

Ji-su		Soon-mi?

Gwang-bae	Screw that, I’m more concerned about the dust in there.

Ji-su		Jae-hyun!

Ji-su		I gotta talk to you.

Jae-hyun	Sorry, I got stuff to prepare.

Jae-hyun	I’m gonna go back.

Young-min	Jae-hyun!

Ji-su		Where are you going?!

Young-min	Hey!

Jae-hyun	Who are you…

Mi-jung	Soon-mi…

Mi-jung	Soon-mi…

Young-min	Ghost of a burned actress. Her name is Soon-mi.

Jae-hyun	Soon-mi in that theater…

Sung-tae	This is what I was going to tell you, Soon-mi.

Joon-seo	Mi-jung, I’m here.

Joon-seo	‘Warning.’

Joon-seo	This making-of was the film?

Gwang-bae	Gather around.

Young-min	What’s that?

Gwang-bae	I saved this from my last production.

Gwang-bae	I thought we could use it as props here.

Gwang-bae	Look, open it here.

Gwang-bae	And then… you’ll see this flint.

Gwang-bae	And use this, one, two.

Gwang-bae	Nice, eh?

Young-min	I think it smokes up too much.

Gwang-bae	Don’t like it?

Ji-su		When the director gets here, I’ll ask him if we’d need it.

Gwang-bae	Even so… keep one each.

Ji-su		Um, okay.

Young-min	I think I’m okay.

Gwang-bae	Take it! It’s dark in here!

Ji-su		Jae-hyun!

Jae-hyun	Is everything ready?

Ji-su		Yeah, but when’s the actress coming?

Jae-hyun	Wait a bit, she’ll be here.

Young-min	Jae-hyun.

Jae-hyun	I gotta get some exterior shots, there’s not enough.

Gwang-bae	Don’t we have enough?

Young-min	What’s with him?

Ji-su		Where is he constantly running off to?

Young-min	Are you all right?

Gwang-bae	Get me some water.

Gwang-bae	Ji-su, he’s not answering?

Ji-su		My battery died…

Gwang-bae	I’m gonna step outside for a bit.

Young-min	Eh? 

Gwang-bae	What’s wrong?

Ji-su		I just turned it on.

Young-min	What’s going on?

Gwang-bae	Hey…

Gwang-bae	Did you even check this?

Gwang-bae	Ji-su, you okay?

Young-min	Are you okay?

Ji-su		Yes, I’m fine.

Gwang-bae	Ji-su, don’t move, stay where you are.

Gwang-bae	Young-min, bring me the flashlight!

Young-min	Where is it?

Ji-su		 I saw it back there…

Gwang-bae	Then check the light in front of Ji-su!

Ji-su		Okay, okay.

Gwang-bae	Ji-su, don’t move, stay right there.

Young-min	Wait a minute.

Young-min	I can’t see anything…

Ji-su 		Young-min!

Gwang-bae	Young-min! Jo Young-min!

Ji-su		Gwang-bae…

Ji-su		Is this…

Ji-su		is this blood?

Ji-su		Jae-hyun, are you outside?!

Ji-su		Jae-hyun!

Gwang-bae	Young-min… Young-min…

Young-min	Please, please…

Young-min	Help me… help me!

Gwang-bae	Who are you?

Gwang-bae	Who are you!

Mi-jung	Can you… see me?

Gwang-bae	Who are you?

Gwang-bae	Stay back…

Jae-hyun	Why are you here?

Mi-jung	I, uh…

Mi-jung	The thing is…

Jae-hyun	Shush.

Jae-hyun	Did you think you could fool me in that body?

Jae-hyun	You’re Soon-mi.

Mi-jung	What are you talking abo…

Jae-hyun	I can’t live like this anymore.

Jae-hyun	I need to end it all.

Mi-jung	Director Kim… I’m not Soon-mi…

Mi-jung	I’m human!

Jae-hyun	I know, you can’t be killed with these things.

Mi-jung	I’m sorry for stealing your hard drive from your home.

Mi-jung	I know everything about the film!

Mi-jung	She did it all, right?

Mi-jung	She killed your crew, screened it in theaters…

Mi-jung	She did it all!

Mi-jung	I know you didn’t do any of that.

Mi-jung	So stop this and let’s leave here together.

Mi-jung	I’ll explain everything to others.

Mi-jung	I’ll tell them you’re innocent, you son of a bitch!

Jae-hyun	I’m innocent?

Jae-hyun	You know everything, I know you do. From where they died… I brought back the tapes.

Jae-hyun	And I edited it.

Jae-hyun	Then I screened it in the theater.

Mi-jung	You are indeed insane...

Jae-hyun	You… made my life into a horror film.  It’s time to end this film. Shit. You’re… insane too…

Mi-jung	Come! Come at me!
 
Mi-jung	Hello?

Producer	Oh my, director Park.

Producer	Why is it so hard to reach you? I believed in you, didn’t I?

Producer	Did you almost kill yourself trying to write the script?

Mi-jung	I’m fine.

Producer	Did you see my texts? When are you available?


Producer	 Tremendous work, can you come here tomorrow?

Producer	We gotta draft the contract, so bring your seal.

Mi-jung	Contract?
 
Producer	Of course, what’s wrong?

Mi-jung	I understand.

Jae-hyun	You’re insane too.

Producer	I just got a call from the investors.

Producer	They saw the rough cut, they absolutely love it.

Producer	This place freaks me out, production design here is…

Producer	Just out of curiousity…

Producer	how much of the film is based on real life?

Mi-jung	Who knows…

Press 1, 2, 3	Director, over here please!

Press 1, 2, 3	Here! Smile please!

Mi-jung 2	Lights went out in the theater, and the audience disappeared… And then…

Young-min	Help me… help me!

Joon-seo	Sir, to the bus terminal…

Phone 		Your call cannot be connected…

Joon-seo	Daejeon, can you get to Daejeon?

Joon-seo	Where are you? I’m inside the theater.

Mi-jung	Why?

Mi-jung	Why?!

Joon-seo	Mi-jung, are you in here?

Mi-jung	Joon-seo, Joon-seo! Joon-seo) - Can you hear me?

Mi-jung	Joon-seo…
