(“One Day at a Time”)
(Episode 105)

ANDI	He proposed.	
KAREN	What?	
NARRATOR	Previously on Sistas.	
ANDI	He needs to give me back my key and he needs to get the hell out of my life.	
AARON	You will not get it.  I'm sure you got a story about some dude that stiffed you on the bill, I'll call my wife.  She'll bring my credit card.	
KAREN	Your what?	
MAURICE	You are such a judgmental little whore.  Judging that man and not wanting to go out with him because you thought he was gay.  He's straight, and he likes you.	
SABRINA	Hi.	
CALVIN	Wow.  You look beautiful.	
ANDI	What the hell are you doing here?	
GARY	I left her.  I'm moving in.	
		
GARY	You're gonna say something?	
ANDI	You did what?	
GARY	I left her.	
ANDI	Gary, I thought we're gonna…	
GARY	Baby, come on.  Tell me that you're happy.	
ANDI	How can I say that?  I…	
GARY	I walked out on her and my family.	
ANDI	Don't you blame that on me.	
GARY	I'm not blaming it on you, I'm not blaming anything on you.  I just--I love you so much and I just say […] and I left.	
ANDI	You don't love me, Gary.	
GARY	What are you talking about?	
ANDI	I don't want you here.	
GARY	Do you know what I went through to be here?  And I'm scared as hell.  And you say something like this to me?  Don't do this.	
ANDI	I didn't ask you to leave her.  That was your choice.	
GARY	I know.  I know.  I made it.	
ANDI	You should go back.	
		
GARY	Don't you dare play this sick ass game with me.	
ANDI	I'm not playing a game with you, Gary.	
GARY	This is my life.	
ANDI	And this is my life, Gary!	
GARY	What the hell is this?  What's going on?	
ANDI	Just go.	
GARY	Is it somebody else?	
ANDI	Oh, don't even try that.  (chuckles)	
GARY	It must be somebody else because of this behavior.	
ANDI	I am not doing this with you right now, okay?	
GARY	You really want me to leave?	
ANDI	Yes.	
GARY	Don't push me back into her arms.  Because you did that once already.	
ANDI	Oh, I did that?	
GARY	Yes.  You did.  I came here with my heart in my hands and you just stomped on it.	
ANDI	Don't you lay that at my door.	
GARY	I will, because you did it.	
ANDI	You are married.	
GARY	I'm divorcing her.  Andi, why else would I have gotten down on my knees and begged you with a ring?	
ANDI	That you walked out of here and put on […] finger.	
GARY	How did you know that?	
		
SINGER	All my girls hold me down, and them boys mess around, and my love life is a headache, we're going out tonight, because I'm (indistinct) love.	
		
GARY	How did you know that, Andi?	
ANDI	You need to leave.	
GARY	How did you know that?	
ANDI	I am not gonna ask you to leave again.	
GARY	I gave up everything for you.	
ANDI	And everything I have is on the line for you.	
GARY	What the hell does that mean?  You're single, you don't have kids screaming, "Don't leave."	
ANDI	But I have a job that I work my ass off to get and I could lose it all.	
GARY	What are you talking about?	
ANDI	She came to visit me.	
GARY	Who?	
ANDI	Gary, you can't say anything or I'll be done, I'll be disbarred.	
GARY	Who came to see you?  Who came to see you?  My wife?	
ANDI	Yes.  But Gary, you can't tell her that I'm telling you this.  I need…	
GARY	Whoa, wait, what are you saying to me?	
ANDI	Promise me.	
GARY	You--she came to you about a divorce?	
ANDI	Promise me.	
GARY	You know I won't say anything.  She did?	
ANDI	Yes.	
GARY	What happened?	
ANDI	Gary, I need you to promise…	
GARY	Just tell me.	
ANDI	She said that she felt that you were gonna divorce her and she wanted to beat you to it.	
GARY	She say why she wanted to leave?	
ANDI	Because you're having an affair.	
GARY	Does she know it's you?	
ANDI	I don't think so.  She hired a private detective who is following you.  He's probably followed you here many times.	
GARY	I knew it.  I knew I was being watched.	
ANDI	She also said that you were too smart to get caught.	
GARY	Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	And that you are slick and cunning…	
GARY	Right.	
ANDI	…and abusive.	
GARY	Abusive?	
ANDI	Yes.	
GARY	What the hell does that mean?	
ANDI	Tell me.	
GARY	Tell you what?  You know me, you know damn well I wouldn't be abusive.	
ANDI	Well, do you want to tell me what she meant?	
GARY	You tell me.	
ANDI	I was gonna recuse myself, but my boss politely suggested that that would be a career-changing mistake.  (sighs)	
GARY	I'm so sorry you're in all of this.	
ANDI	I'm a big girl.  I knew you were married.	
GARY	If she comes to see you, you can't take the case.	
ANDI	Yeah, I know that.	
GARY	(sighs) I'll have one of my friends rep me in the divorce.	
ANDI	Baby, you can't tell a soul.	
GARY	I won't.  Baby, it's--is this why you're acting like this?  Please, don't give up on me now.  I'm here.  (smooches) I'm here.	
		
AARON	I'm not doing this with you.	
KAREN	This is crazy (indistinct) forgive me.	
AARON	Karen?  Come on, let's go.  Like, look, no.	
FAWN	Are you on a date?	
AARON	Listen, you don't have the right to ask me any questions, okay?  Not anymore.  Karen, can we…	
KAREN	No.  No.  Y'all need to go figure this out, okay?	
AARON	No.  There's nothing to figure out.	
KAREN	It don't look that way to me.	
AARON	Karen, can you just…	
KAREN	I said no!	
FAWN	He tell you what I did?	
KAREN	Honey, whatever you did is your business, okay?  Excuse me.	
FAWN	I slept with his friend, he's so angry with me…	
KAREN	Okay.  Look, I don't care.  I don't.  No.	
FAWN	He's really good at punishing you when you do something wrong.	
AARON	Why the fuck would you say that?	
KAREN	Okay.	
AARON	Karen.	
KAREN	I'm out.	
AARON	No, no, no, no.  Karen, Karen, just…	
KAREN	(chuckles) No.  No.  Bye.	
AARON	Can you just…	
KAREN	Don't touch me.	
		
CALVIN	That may have been the best dinner that I've ever had.	
SABRINA	(chuckles) Really?	
CALVIN	Really.	
SABRINA	It wasn't too overcooked?	
CALVIN	No, it's perfect.	
SABRINA	Oh, okay.	
CALVIN	No, no, no, no, no.	
SABRINA	No?	
CALVIN	I got this.	
SABRINA	I got it.	
CALVIN	No, you cook.  Sabrina.	
SABRINA	Calvin?	
CALVIN	Do you want me to leave?	
SABRINA	No.	
CALVIN	All right.  Well, let me wash these dishes then.	
SABRINA	All right.	
CALVIN	You know?	
SABRINA	Hmm?	
CALVIN	On second thought, you can rinse.	
SABRINA	(chuckles) Of course.	
CALVIN	Oh.	
SABRINA	And tell me the truth.	
CALVIN	Okay.	
SABRINA	Why are you single?	
CALVIN	(scoffs) I'm single because I always get prejudged.	
SABRINA	Prejudged?	
CALVIN	Yeah, kind of like how you did.	
SABRINA	(sighs) I'm sorry I did that.	
CALVIN	Look, I get it, you know.  You know, I had a girlfriend in high school.  Yeah, I really liked her, but, uh, her parents wouldn't let her go to prom with me because I had two dads.	
SABRINA	What?	
CALVIN	Yeah, times are different then, but it's fine.	
SABRINA	No, no, that's--that's not fine.	
CALVIN	Okay.	
SABRINA	Oh, no.  I didn't know.	
CALVIN	Yeah.	
SABRINA	I--come on.	
CALVIN	Yeah, okay.  All right.	
SABRINA	Look, I am really sorry.	
CALVIN	Well, you still have some making up to do, young lady.	
SABRINA	(sucks teeth) Yeah?	
CALVIN	Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	And how am I supposed to do that?	
CALVIN	(sucks teeth) We'll, I could think of some places to start.	
SABRINA	(chuckles) Oh, oh.  Sorry.  Are we talking about sex right now?	
CALVIN	I'm talking about whatever you wanna do.	
SABRINA	Yeah, well, we're not gonna do any of that.	
CALVIN	Oh, I get it.  You're one of those.	
SABRINA	One of what?	
CALVIN	One of those women who wanna hold out but really wanna give it.	
SABRINA	No.  I am my own woman and I'm not gonna get roped in by the likes of you.	
CALVIN	I'm not trying to rope you into doing anything.	
SABRINA	Aha.  It's time for you to go home.	
CALVIN	Oh, yeah, because it is getting hot in here.	
SABRINA	Yeah.	
CALVIN	So, um, when can I see you again?	
SABRINA	When do you wanna see me again?	
CALVIN	In the morning?	
SABRINA	That's really soon.	
CALVIN	I know.  I wanna stay.	
SABRINA	You're not staying.	
CALVIN	Oh, no?	
SABRINA	No.  Calvin.  Cal…(chuckles) Calvin.  Oh!  Calvin!  What are you doing?  You can stay!  You can stay!  Oh!	
		
SABRINA	(chuckles)	
CALVIN	What's wrong?  What?  (sighs)	
SABRINA	Uh, can we just do what we were doing before?	
CALVIN	Say no more.	
		
SABRINA	Oh.	
		
RAPPER	Ah.  Cut the, we're gonna cut the (indistinct) stupid in the spot 'cause (indistinct) cut the…

ZAC	With what?	
DANNI	You need some help?	
ZAC	With what?	
DANNI	Putting on that lotion.	
ZAC	How do you know what I'm doing?	
DANNI	I know the sound of lotion on a man's body, Zac.  I know the sound very well.	
ZAC	Danni, why don't you go to sleep?	
DANNI	I'm trying, but you're in there smelling all good and stuff.	
ZAC	Danni, how do you know what I smell like?	
DANNI	My nose has an imagination.	
ZAC	(scoffs) Yo, yo!  Is this gonna be a problem?	
DANNI	I don't know what you're talking about.  What do you mean?	
ZAC	Me staying here.	
DANNI	Not bothering me.	
ZAC	You sure?	
DANNI	Boy, you are not that damn fine.  But--ooh, damn.  You must really work your ass, huh?	
ZAC	What?	
DANNI	Just, you know, sitting up there like a serene…	
ZAC	Yo, Danni!  How are you watching me?	
DANNI	Hot damn.  I'm not!

ZAC	Danni, that's not funny.	
DANNI	Okay.  Okay.	
ZAC	That's why I didn't wanna stay here.	
DANNI	This is better than a shelter!	
ZAC	I don't know.	
DANNI	Sleeping next to a bunch of all the--give me…	
ZAC	You better stay in there.	
DANNI	Boy, I don't know who you think you are, but you are not that damn sexy.	
ZAC	You heard me.	
DANNI	I like that turtleneck though.	
ZAC	Come on, Danni!	
DANNI	Sorry.  It's a joke.	
ZAC	And you're smoking?	
DANNI	Yeah.	
ZAC	They don't test you for that at the airport?	
DANNI	I have prescription for cataracts.	
ZAC	Damn, I wish.	
DANNI	Here.	
ZAC	No, I can't.	
DANNI	It's on.  Here, come on.  You can smoke it.	
ZAC	And if I lose my job, then what?	
DANNI	Uh, it wouldn't be the first time.	
ZAC	Uh-huh.	
DANNI	Just smoke it.	
ZAC	It wouldn't be the first time.	
DANNI	Oh, my God.  Just let me know if Davie tries to stop you.  He knows I got a hell of shit on him.  Here.	
ZAC	You sure you got me?	
DANNI	Do you know how many hoes he's sleeping with?  Huh?  I got you.  You're welcome.	
		
ZAC	(inhales) (coughs) Oh, shit.

DANNI	We'll see.	
ZAC	Stay in there.	
DANNI	Just pull it down real quick.  Let me see it again.  Life in living color.  Did you wear my Jack & Jill?	
ZAC	Danni!	
		
ANDI	(sighs)	
GARY	So what do we do?	
ANDI	What do you mean?	
GARY	If you want me to leave, I will.	
ANDI	I think that maybe you should…	
GARY	Well, baby, please think about what you're about to say to me.	
ANDI	Gary, I have done nothing but think for the last few days.  Uh…	
GARY	Is that him?	
ANDI	I'm sure it is.	
KAREN	Girl, this wife came to the restaurant.  The whole restaurant.  The whole--oh, shit.  Um, hi.	
GARY	Hi.	
KAREN	I'm clearly interrupting something.  I could just come back later.	
GARY	No, no, no, no, no, no.  I can let you two talk.	
KAREN	Andi?	
ANDI	Yeah, he should.	
GARY	Shall I take my things with me?  Shall I take my things with me?	
KAREN	Andi?  Gary, can you just go for a walk for a bit, let us talk?	
GARY	No.  No, I'd like to hear that from her.	
KAREN	Well, I've known her for a long time, so can you?	
GARY	Okay.	
ANDI	(clears throat)	
KAREN	Girl, what the hell?  He brought all his stuff over here?	
ANDI	Girl, he said he moved out.  And when I walked in, he was here with all his things.	
KAREN	Oh, so he left her?	
ANDI	Yes.  In here crying like a baby.	
KAREN	Well, that's one good thing.	
ANDI	How?	
KAREN	He's here.	
ANDI	He just made up with that woman.	
KAREN	Wait, I don't--you missing the point.  He's here for you.  He left her.  So…	
ANDI	You know what I'm mad about?  I'm mad he gave her that ring.  I know it sounds crazy.	
KAREN	Look, he's here.	
ANDI	It matters how he got here.	
KAREN	He wasn't happy.	
ANDI	Yeah, but she was.  She was so happy with him.  She loved him.  I--I saw it in her eyes.  I saw it in her body.  She loves him, and I feel like...	
KAREN	What did you think would happen, Andi?	
ANDI	Not this.	
KAREN	You can't have it all your way, okay?  He's here.  He left her, okay?  You just got to stick with the here and now.  I don't know what to tell you.  You got to deal with this.	
ANDI	When I found out he was married, I should've stopped.	
KAREN	But you didn't.  So let's just deal with the here and now, okay?	
ANDI	Karen, you don't understand.	
KAREN	Look, honey, it's over.  He's here.  Just start from here.  Just one day at a time.  Girl, one day at a time.  Come on.	
ANDI	Yeah.	
KAREN	You good.	
		
SABRINA	Hey.  Hey.  Hmm.	
CALVIN	Hey.	
SABRINA	Hey.	
CALVIN	What time is it?	
SABRINA	Hmm.  Oh, it's, it's 1:00.	
CALVIN	Oh, shit.  I'm sorry I got to go home.  I didn't plan to stay this late.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Uh, am I good to see you again?	
CALVIN	Yeah.  I'll call you tomorrow?	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.	
CALVIN	I'm sorry.	
SABRINA	Stop apologizing.	
CALVIN	Okay.  All right.  Goodnight.	
SABRINA	Bye.	
DANNI	Ooh.	
SABRINA	What are you doing up?	
DANNI	I knew you got your ass done.	
SABRINA	What?	
DANNI	Your ass looks good.  You got the side dimples filled in.	
SABRINA	No, that's Calvin. That's why I hate calling your ass because I know it's on mute and I know you're laughing.	
DANNI	I'm sorry.  You are a dirty bitch.	
SABRINA	Girl, bye.	
DANNI	No.  Wait, wait, wait.  So that's his ass?	
SABRINA	Yes.  That's what I've been trying to tell you.	
DANNI	His ass is pretty.	
SABRINA	I know.	
DANNI	Prettier than yours.	
SABRINA	Really, Danni?	
DANNI	Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  So you slept--you slept with him?	
SABRINA	(sighs) Girl, he came on so strong, I was weak.	
DANNI	Oh, well, what was the sex like?  Is it big?	
SABRINA	Hmm.  I don't know.	
DANNI	Wait, what do you mean?	
SABRINA	He didn't come up.	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	Girl, I saw those panties and I just let him do me all night.  I, I couldn't.	
DANNI	Can I get his number?	
SABRINA	Will you stop it?	
DANNI	No.  All night?	
SABRINA	He didn't come up at all.	
DANNI	Girl, I don't know.  I don't know any man that's not waiting for his turn.  You know, Jerome don't be down there 30 seconds before he's like, "Do me."	
SABRINA	Stop putting things in my head, okay?	
DANNI	I'm not putting things in your head.  And he didn't put his head in nothing either.	
SABRINA	(sighs) See?  Why did I send you that picture?	
DANNI	Okay.  I--well, I got to get up in a few hours for work.	
SABRINA	That never stopped you from talking to me before.	
DANNI	I gotta go.	
SABRINA	You're about to send that picture to Karen and Andi, aren't you?	
DANNI	I sent it to them when you sent it to me already, girl, okay?	
SABRINA	Ugh.  Oh, my God.  Bye.	
DANNI	Bye.  Red panties.  Some shit right there.	
		
GARY	I know you're scared.  I'm scared, too.	
ANDI	Tell me what I'm scared of.	
GARY	Everything.  The things that my wife said to you, that I'm an abuser and I'm lying.  If I'll stay, is this is all real.  To tell you the truth, there's things I'm scared about, too.	
ANDI	Like what?	
GARY	You gotta be able to handle my honesty.	
ANDI	Tell me.	
GARY	What if I was supposed to stay in my marriage and work it out?  You know, figure it out, fix it.	
ANDI	That's fair.	
GARY	You're not--you're not mad about that?	
ANDI	No.	
GARY	Thank you for understanding.	
ANDI	Let's just take it one day at a time.	
GARY	I think I may need one minute at a time.	
ANDI	I get it.	
GARY	She may come back to see you.	
ANDI	Yeah, I was thinking about that.	
GARY	What are you gonna do?	
ANDI	I'm gonna tell her I can't represent her.	
GARY	You think that's best?	
ANDI	It's my only option.  What do you mean?  What is it?  Tell me.	
GARY	Baby, I don't have a pre-nup.  She's gonna take everything.	
ANDI	Oh.  Oh, gosh.  Um, well, you could just get a really good lawyer.	
GARY	That was my worry.  That's why I didn't wanna leave her.	
ANDI	But you said it was because of the children.	
GARY	I mean, they're my main reason, but fuck, losing half everything I worked for is the other.  But, um, maybe if you represented her, you could…	
ANDI	What the hell are you saying?	
GARY	Nothing.  Never mind.	
ANDI	Right.  Forget about that.	
GARY	I just know half of what she takes from me is half of what she takes from our future.	
ANDI	I am going to try and forget that you said that.	
GARY	Babe, I'm--I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.	
ANDI	As hard as that may be.	
GARY	No, I--I'm sorry, I had a drink and this is--this is a lot going on, and I'm sorry.	
ANDI	Can we go to bed now?	
GARY	You're not angry?  Come on, babe.	
ANDI	Hey, I just wanna go to sleep.	
GARY	Babe, I'm sorry.	
ANDI	Goodnight.	
GARY	It's the bourbon.  Goodnight.  I love you.  Say it back to me.	
ANDI	I love you.  Goodnight.	
		
DANNI	(indistinct) in.  Unless you think (indistinct) that off, stop dancing.  Give me the pen.	
ZAC	You funny.	
DANNI	What's so funny?  I don't…	
ZAC	You funny.	
DANNI	What's so funny?	
ZAC	You are funny.	
DANNI	What are you talking about?	
ZAC	You be like, "Yo, yo, I like you, you look so good, he looks so good, let me see that…"	
DANNI	Yeah.  Let me see it.  Or get off my bed.	
ZAC	You do that so that no one can tell that you're lonely.	
DANNI	I'm not lonely.	
ZAC	(laughs) Oh, yes, you are.	
DANNI	I'm not.	
ZAC	You, you've been chasing after Jerome.	
DANNI	He's chasing after me.	
ZAC	That's because you give it up to him whenever he wants.	
DANNI	Zac!	
ZAC	(laughs) I'm just saying.  Look at you.	
DANNI	(blows raspberries) What the hell you mean?	
ZAC	Wait.  Wait.	
DANNI	No, get your bitch ass out…	
ZAC	Wait.  Wait.  Ow, wait, wait!	
DANNI	Damn it.  Get your ass out my house!	
ZAC	Wait.  Wait.  You haven't noticed how funny that sound?	
DANNI	Okay.  I'm about to throw all your shit out.	
ZAC	Wait, no, wait.  I--wait, wait.	
DANNI	Zac!	
ZAC	Well, okay.  Wait, wait, I'mma be serious, I'mma be serious.  Look at you.	
DANNI	You said that.	
ZAC	Stop, listen.  Listen.  Look at you.	
DANNI	Okay.	
ZAC	Okay?  Look, listen, okay?  How beautiful you are, just look.  You're just, like, so soft and chocolate, like a chocolate cloud.	
DANNI	What are you doing?	
ZAC	Like a chocolate cloud.	
DANNI	What are you doing?	
ZAC	I don't know.  I don't know.	
DANNI	Okay.  You are high as hell right now, so you should go.	
ZAC	I--I am, but wait.  Wait.  I know how beautiful you are when I'm high or I'm not.  And it just makes me think, like, how different things could have been if you would have paid attention to me, rather than making jokes about my body, and pushing me off on your friend.	
		
ZAC	You're an asshole.  Yeah.	
DANNI	Hmm.  I'm the asshole.	
ZAC	I gotta go to bed.	
DANNI	Yeah.  You should do that.	
ZAC	That pen, that's--that--that--ooh, that pen--you're soft, though.  Soft chocolate-y.	
		
ZAC	Soft chocolate.  And that pen?  That's--that's the truth telling right there.  Hey.  Wait.	
DANNI	Shut up!	
FAWN	Hi.  Can I talk to you?	
KAREN	No.	
FAWN	Please?	
KAREN	Look, you need to talk to your husband, okay?	
		
FAWN	He won't talk to me.	
KAREN	Well, I'm sorry.	
FAWN	Will you please leave him alone?	
KAREN	No.  Will you please leave me alone?  I ain't got nothing to do with this.	
FAWN	But he likes you.	
KAREN	He don't even know me, okay?  And how did you know where I work?	
FAWN	He liked your pictures on Qwikgram.	
KAREN	I'm getting rid of that shit.	
FAWN	Can you just please leave him alone?	
KAREN	Honey, I'm not messing with your husband, okay?  He came after me.	
FAWN	What, you turned him down?	
KAREN	Look, you really just need to talk to him.	
FAWN	I wanna talk to you.	
KAREN	I don't wanna talk to you.	
FAWN	Please.	
KAREN	What the hell is going on?	
FAWN	I love him so much.	
KAREN	Well, you cheated on him.	
FAWN	I made the stupidest mistake of my life.  I slept with someone.  It was just sex.  I got weak.	
KAREN	This ain't none of my business, it's really not.	
FAWN	It is, okay?  Because he is great.  He is perfect with our children.  He loves me from the bottom of his heart.  He doesn't cheat on me, he doesn't even look at other women.  I can't believe I'm saying all this to you.	
KAREN	I can't either.  And if you want me to stay away from him, you should probably stop telling me how good he is.	
FAWN	(sighs) Sorry, I've just never been in a situation like this before.	
KAREN	Neither have I.  Ever.	
FAWN	Look, I just hope that…	
KAREN	Look, honey.  Stop hoping, okay?  Go home.  Talk to your husband.  I ain't in this.  I'm not.	
FAWN	Will you just please not talk to him anymore?	
KAREN	Okay.  Goodbye.	
FAWN	That's, that's not a no.	
KAREN	Bye!	
		
FAWN	Give me six months, okay?  Just to try to save my marriage.  Six months.  If it doesn't work, I'll walk away, I'll bring him to you.  Just give me six months, please?	
KAREN	Right.  Okay.	
		
MAURICE	Come on with it.	
SABRINA	With what?	
MAURICE	Don't try it, girl.  Did you sleep with him?	
SABRINA	No.	
MAURICE	No, ma'am.  You got that glow.	
SABRINA	Look, we just had dinner.	
		
MAURICE	How was the meat?	
SABRINA	You know what, Maurice?  If you're gonna be vulgar, I'm not going to talk to you about it.	
MAURICE	Okay.  Okay.  I guess you just woke up a virgin.	
SABRINA	Will you stop it?	
MAURICE	(sighs) Was it good?	
SABRINA	What are you talking about?	
MAURICE	(chuckles) Well, I was talking about the date.  That's that guilt talking now.  You did.  I know you did it.	
SABRINA	Wait, what did he tell you?	
MAURICE	He didn't tell me anything.  But your face has told me everything.  Ha!	
SABRINA	Okay, look, we had dinner.  It was nice.  That was it.	
MAURICE	Something turned you off?  What was it?	
SABRINA	How do you know this?	
MAURICE	Sabrina, we've been sitting next to each other for years now.  I know you.	
SABRINA	(sighs) All right.	
MAURICE	I knew it.  I knew it.  I knew you did it.	
SABRINA	No.	
MAURICE	Yes.	
SABRINA	No, no, no, no, no.  We didn't do it.  He just give me a little, you know?	
MAURICE	Was he good?	
SABRINA	(chuckles) Yes.  It was really good, it was amazing.  And he loved it.	
MAURICE	Oh, yeah.	
SABRINA	He was just really committed.	
MAURICE	Oh.	
SABRINA	He wouldn't stop.	
MAURICE	Oh, yeah, girl, go ahead.	
SABRINA	And when I tried to pull him up, I just…	
MAURICE	Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	I don't know, he wouldn't come up, so I couldn't see if he was hard or anything.	
MAURICE	Hmm.	
SABRINA	What do you think?	
MAURICE	Girl, I think you found the last unicorn.	
SABRINA	Maurice.	
MAURICE	You know how men get.  They'd be like, "I'm done.  Your turn."  (scoffs) You know…	
SABRINA	You sound like Danni.	
MAURICE	Please don't ever say that to me again.	
SABRINA	Do not talk about my friend that way.	
MAURICE	She probably told you some stupid… like, "Because he didn't wanna come up that he was gay."  Oh, man.	
SABRINA	She didn't say that.	
MAURICE	You need to get that, and her, out of your head.  That is a good man.	
SABRINA	Hmm.  (clears throat) Maurice, I was thinking about buying him something.	
MAURICE	Ooh, girl, you must've been damn good.  You buying him stuff already?  Be careful with that (indistinct) took all my red money.  (scoffs)	
SABRINA	Well, can you just tell me?  What do you think about these?	
		
MAURICE	Oh, I have those.  Uh-uh.  He's not gonna like that.  That's for easy access.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.  Okay.  What about that one?	
MAURICE	Oh, no--no, ma'am.  That--that is also for--he's not gonna like any of those.  See right there?  That's a flap for that quick slap.  Well, I have customers.	
SABRINA	We ain't even open yet.	
MAURICE	(indistinct)	
		
ANDI	Hey, girl.	
KAREN	Oh, perfect timing.	
ANDI	Except when it comes to men.	
KAREN	Oh, I meant I got a break.  So…	
ANDI	Oh, yeah.	
KAREN	You wanna go to the juice bar (indistinct)	
ANDI	Yes, please.	
KAREN	Okay.	
ANDI	Let's go.	
KAREN	All right.  Jamie, I'll be right back.  My God, let's get this juice.	
ANDI	I'm ready.	
KAREN	So…	
ANDI	What is it?	
KAREN	How's it going?	
ANDI	(sighs)	
KAREN	Tell me how last night went.	
ANDI	No, enough of my shit.  You tell me.	
KAREN	Come on.  Tell me, I wanna know.	
ANDI	(chuckles) I was in the shower this morning and I remember you telling me that his wife came to the restroom?	
KAREN	Oh, God.	
ANDI	Uh-huh.  What were you talking about?	
KAREN	Just nothing.	
ANDI	Hey.	
KAREN	Hmm?	
ANDI	What is it?	
KAREN	Okay, fine.	
ANDI	So?  Who is this guy?	
KAREN	Some guy I met at the supermarket.	
ANDI	Do not date a married man.	
KAREN	Girl, he ain't married.  He's leaving.	
ANDI	Do you not see what I'm going through?	
KAREN	It's not like that.	
ANDI	It must be like that if she's meeting you at the restaurant.	
KAREN	Will you listen, okay?  He forgot his wallet, call his wife, she brought it to him.	
ANDI	Oh.  They're swingers.	
KAREN	No, they're not, okay?  She cheated on him and he's leaving her.  Whatcha gonna get?	
ANDI	That sounds awfully familiar, don't you think?	
KAREN	Do you wanna know what happened?	
ANDI	Yes.	
KAREN	Okay.  His wife showed up at my job this morning.	
ANDI	What?	
KAREN	Yeah.  She was telling me how good he is and just begging me to leave him alone.	
ANDI	Did she threaten you?	
KAREN	No.  Girl.  No.  She was begging, I mean, full white tears all over.	
ANDI	The white tears?	
KAREN	Yes.  White ones.	
ANDI	Hmm.  Saying what?	
KAREN	That he's a good man.  Just please leave him alone.  Give her a chance to fix her marriage for six months.  If it don't work out, she'll bring him.	
ANDI	What?	
KAREN	Yeah.	
ANDI	Wait, wait, wait.  Is this a black woman?  That's what I thought.	
KAREN	Right.	
ANDI	Because that's crazy.	
KAREN	Exactly.  You telling me.	
ANDI	That's insane.	
		
ANDI	Wait, so do you think he's gonna leave her?	
KAREN	Who knows.	
ANDI	Do you like him?	
KAREN	He's all right.	
		
ANDI	Oh, you like him-like him.	
KAREN	Look, I just met him.  Stop.  You gonna order, go ahead, order something.	
ANDI	No, this is more important.  You should go for it.	
KAREN	No, I'm not gonna do that.	
ANDI	No?	
KAREN	No.  Look, if he gets a divorce, maybe.  But until then, I don't wanna be the rebound chick.	
ANDI	Like me?	
KAREN	I didn't mean it like that.	
ANDI	No, it's true.	
KAREN	Andi…	
ANDI	No, look, it's okay.  It's okay.	
KAREN	Girl, I'm sorry.  Really, I am.  Okay?	
ANDI	Something made me feel so sick last night.	
KAREN	What was it?	
ANDI	Do you know he asked me to represent her to help him with his divorce?	
KAREN	What?	
ANDI	Yeah.	
KAREN	He just said it like that?	
ANDI	Well, he was a bit drunk, but yeah.	
KAREN	That is low.	
ANDI	I know.  But it's so out of character.  And the whole time, I'm thinking, "Do I even know this man?"	
KAREN	Andi, you're not thinking about doing it?  (indistinct)	
ANDI	No.  (scoffs) Not at all.  But I'll tell you something else that bothers me.	
KAREN	What?	
ANDI	She hasn't called me today.	
KAREN	You want her to call you?	
ANDI	I mean, I'm gonna refer her to another lawyer, but why hasn't she called me?  Something's up.	
KAREN	I wonder what it is.	
ANDI	I don't know.  But it's not good.	
KAREN	(sighs)	
ANDI	I'm not even hungry anymore.	
KAREN	It was juice, girl.  It's not a meal replacement.	
ANDI	Either way, I'm not hungry.  My appetite is gone.  Is that okay with you?	
KAREN	You can go.  I'm getting a smoothie.	
		
ANDI	Okay, fine.	
WOMAN	Hi, how are you?	
		
FATIMA	Ms.  Barnes?  Mr.  Bellamy would like to see you in the conference room.  And he said to bring your things.	
ANDI	(sighs)	
		
MAN	Next on "Sistas…"	
ANDI	What's going on?	
DON	Ms.  Borders, go on.	
JASMIN	Are you really okay with this?	
DANNI	I'm telling you, he came and went to me.	
SABRINA	I'm telling you he was high.	
DANNI	Are you saying you can only get attracted to me if he's high?	
SABRINA	Come on, he could be the one.	
ANDI	But whatever you do, don't cheat on him.	
CALVIN	God, I had the greatest time last night.	
SABRINA	Did you?	
CALVIN	You didn't?	
SABRINA	You did do all the work.	
CALVIN	Because you didn't want to.	
ZAC	As long as you keep being this girl right here, we always gonna be friends.  But that girl that I met that night, don't ever let her show up.  And we gonna have no problems.
