KAI	THEY’RE JUST PLAIN CRAZY. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!

EARL ROCULA	OH, GIVE ME A HUG!

EARL ROCULA’S CHILDREN	WE LOVE YOU, DAD! LOOK!

KAI	WHY DO THEY ENVY US? WE'RE ORPHANS WHO ARE FORCED TO TRAVEL AROUND LIKE GYPSIES!

GERDA	TO THEM, WE’RE LEGENDS! WE DEFEATED THE SNOW QUEEN AND SAVED THE WORLD!

KAI	LEGENDS? REALLY? SOMEHOW I FEEL MORE LIKE A CIRCUS SIDESHOW ACT. LIKE A SINGING DONKEY.

TEACHER	THE STUDENTS ARE JUST ARRIVING NOW. WE’LL BRING YOU OUT IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES!

GERDA	AT LEAST WITH THESE KIDS... THERE’S SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO NEEDS US.

KAI	NO ONE WILL EVER REPLACE OUR PARENTS, GERDA.

KAI	HERE, I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS. IT’S A DRAWING I MADE FOR YOU. 

GERDA	WOW, KAI! YOU DREW THIS? THANK YOU! IT'S BEAUTIFUL! IT’S AMAZING!

GERDA	BUT YOU WERE SO LITTLE THE LAST TIME YOU SAW THEM. HOW DID YOU REMEMBER WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE? 

KAI	SOMETIMES I SEE THEM IN MY DREAMS.

GERDA	OH KAI, THANK YOU.

TEACHER	WE HAVE VERY SPECIAL GUESTS HERE TODAY, CHILDREN! HERE THEY ARE, THE FAMOUS DEFEATERS OF THE SNOW QUEEN, THE SIBLING LEGENDS, GERDA AND KAI!

GERDA	AND THAT’S HOW WE DEFEATED THE SNOW QUEEN!

SCHOOL KIDS	HOORAY! HOORAY!

GERDA	OUR PARENTS WOULD BE PROUD OF US NOW.

SCHOOL KIDS	GIVE ME THAT! GIVE ME THAT! I WANT THAT!

TEACHER	WAIT! STOP!

TEACHER	YOU FORGOT YOUR PAYMENT! 

TEACHER	HERE YOU ARE! YOU GAVE SUCH A GREAT PERFORMANCE!

KAI	LOOKS LIKE WE’LL GO WITHOUT DINNER TONIGHT.

KAI	REMEMBER, THEY CAN’T DESTROY OUR MEMORIES, AND THIS... LET ME FIX IT.

GERDA	TOUGH LUCK! OKAY, WHAT’S NEXT?

GERDA	TOMORROW WE’RE SPEAKING AT ANOTHER GRADE SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. AND AFTER THAT...

KAI	LET ME SEE THAT.

GERDA	KAI! 

KAI	TRAVELING AROUND FROM TOWN TO TOWN, FOR PEANUTS! THIS WOULDN’T BE HAPPENING TO US IF OUR PARENTS WERE AROUND, YOU CAN BE SURE OF THAT!

GERDA	BUT WE DON’T HAVE PARENTS ANY MORE.

GERDA	WHAT ELSE WOULD WE DO? WHERE WOULD WE GO?

KAI	I’VE ALREADY THOUGHT EVERYTHING THROUGH. WE’LL STAY WITH ORM FOR AWHILE! HE'LL BE HAPPY TO HAVE US OVER, AND THE OTHER TROLLS DON'T REALLY CARE WHO WE ARE. NO ONE WILL EVER PLAY NASTY TRICKS ON US, OR TEAR US APART FOR SOUVENIRS!

GERDA	STAY WITH ORM? 

KAI	YEAH, WE’LL STAY WITH HIM AND THEN DECIDE WHAT TO DO NEXT.

GERDA	I GUESS IT COULD WORK. BUT IF YOU DIDN’T LIKE THE WAY WE LIVED, WHY DIDN’T YOU SAY SO BEFORE? 

KAI	I TRIED! YOU JUST DIDN’T LISTEN.

GERDA	OH, KAI, I-- AAAH!!

DRIVER	HEY!!

GERDA	LOOKS LIKE WE’RE WALKING TO ORM’S.

KAI	CHEER UP! JUST THINK OF THE COOL LIFE WE’LL HAVE THERE, AND COOL PLACE TO STAY. AND NO MORE SNOW QUEEN STORIES! PROMISE ME!

GERDA	I PROMISE.

KAI	NO ONE WILL KNOW WHO WE REALLY ARE, SO LET’S KEEP IT THAT WAY! I THINK WE EVEN NEED TO CHANGE OUR NAMES.

GERDA	CHANGE OUR NAMES? WHY?

KAI	WE NEED SIMPLE AND UNASSUMING NAMES. HOW ABOUT HANSEL AND GRETEL? WE’RE REGULAR KIDS, NOT SOME LEGENDS!

GERDA	OR EVEN BETTER, HOW ABOUT PIRATE NAMES? YOU CAN BE CUTTHROAT CARL, AND I’LL BE--

KAI	PIRATES!

GERDA	KAI, WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?!

KAI	SOMETIMES ALFIDA GOES OUT SKIING IN THIS AREA! SHE KNOWS MY SIGNAL! 

KAI	WITH ANY LUCK, SHE’LL SEE US!

GERDA	ALFIDA? THE PIRATE GIRL?

ALFIDA	KAI! 

GERDA	SO THIS IS WHAT YOU MEANT BY SKIING?! AMAZING!

ALFIDA	LOOKS LIKE YOU LUBBERS COULD USE A LIFT! CLIMB ABOARD!

ALFIDA	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DID YOU FINALLY DECIDE TO BECOME PIRATES?

KAI	NO WAY! YOU WILL TAKE US TO ORM’S? 

ALFIDA	SURE. I’M ALL FREE NOW, I’M ON MY HOLIDAY.

ORM	WHA ?! HMM!

ORM	I’LL GET YOU!

ORM	HUH?

ORM	ARRGGHH!

KAI	AND ORM DOESN’T FEEL BORING HERE!

GERDA	LUTA!

ALFIDA	HI ORM!

ORM	KAI! GERDA! ALFIDA! MY OLD FRIENDS!

GERDA	NICE PLACE YOU’VE GOT HERE!

ALFIDA	BY THUNDER, THIS IS A RIGHT AWESOME CABIN!

ORM	YEAH, WELL, GRANDMA BECAME THE QUEEN! AND NOW I HAVE SOME RELATIVES I DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT BEFORE!

KAI	I’M OFF TO THE MOUNTAINSIDE. I WANT TO PAINT THE LANDSCAPE IN THE MOONLIGHT.

ROLLAN	BUENAS TARDES!

ORM	HEY! DIDN’T ANYONE TEACH YOU TO KNOCK FIRST?

ROLLAN	SORRY, ORM, BUT YOU PROMISED TO TELL ONE MORE LEGEND.

ORM	SURE, COME ON IN. MEET GERDA, ALFIDA AND KAI. 

ORM	GUYS, THIS IS ROLLAN.

ROLLAN	HOLA, AMIGOS.

GERDA	HI.

GERDA	SO YOU’RE FROM SPAIN? HOW DID YOU END UP HERE?

ROLLAN	THIS PIRATE LADY GAVE ME A BOOK THAT OPENED MY EYES AND CHANGED MY LIFE! I’M FASCINATED BY LEGENDS! SO I CAME HERE, TO THE LAND OF THE LEGENDS! EVERYONE KNOWS THAT TROLLS ARE FAMOUS FOR THEM!

ALFIDA	PIRATE LADY? OH, THAT WAS MY MOM. SHE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU. “THE LEGEND FANATIC.” 

ALFIDA	THE PIRATES STILL LAUGH ABOUT IT.

ROLLAN	I BELIEVE THE OLD SAYING: “WHERE’S THERE’S SMOKE, THERE’S FIRE!” LEGENDS DO EXIST! THEY’RE ALL AROUND US!

ROLLAN	GERDA AND KAI ARE SUCH BEAUTIFUL NAMES, STRAIGHT FROM THE LEGEND ORM ONCE TOLD ME. 

KAI	ACTUALLY, OUR NAMES ARE VERY COMMON WHERE WE COME FROM.

GERDA	ORM TOLD YOU? HOW INTERESTING! WHAT LEGEND IS THAT? TELL US!

ROLLAN	FINE, THEN. LISTEN TO MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, WHICH IS ABOUT GERDA, WHO SAVED ALL THE TROLLS FROM THE SNOW QUEEN!

ROLLAN	REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WE HAD A VERY LONG WINTER, AND NOBODY KNEW WHY? SOMEONE BLAMED A GLOBAL COLD SNAP, SOMEONE ELSE, A CONSPIRACY OF SLED AND SKI SELLERS. BUT INDEED, THAT WAS THE DOING OF THE MIGHTY SNOW QUEEN!

KAI	NO WAY! REALLY?

ROLLAN	SI, MI AMIGO! AND WE WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN FROZEN, IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE TWO HEROES - GERDA AND KAI. 

GERDA	WOW!

ROLLAN	SO HERE’S HOW THE STORY GOES...

ROLLAN	AND THEN GERDA LEAPED ON THE SNOW QUEEN AND YELLED “ABRACADABRA!”

ROLLAN	THEN GERDA GRABS THE SNOW QUEEN BY THE COLLAR, REALLY LETS HER HAVE IT!

ROLLAN	AND THE SNOW QUEEN IS LIKE “OH, LITTLE GERDA, PLEASE DON’T KILL ME!” AND GERDA SAYS, “YOU KIDNAPPED MY BROTHER, YOU FROZE MY PARENTS, I WILL DESTROY YOU!” AND SHE BEAT HER WITH MAGIC, MAGIC AND MORE MAGIC!

ROLLAN	ABRACADABRA! SKORIKY-YORIKY!

ALFIDA	GERDA LOOKS AT ROLLAN WITH ADMIRATION.

ROLLAN	...THEN GERDA THROWS THE SNOW QUEEN RIGHT UP INTO THE SKY! NOW THERE SHE IS, THE NORTH STAR!

GERDA	WOW, THAT’S AMAZING! WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE THE NORTH STAR?

ROLLAN	UMMM...

ORM	I’LL GO GET SOME FIREWOOD. IT’S GETTING PRETTY CHILLY IN HERE.

GERDA	ORM?!

ORM	WHAT?!

GERDA	WERE YOU TROLLING HIM?

ORM	WHY ARE YOU BLAMING ME? TROLLS ALLOVER OUR KINGDOM COMPETE TO COME UP WITH THE FUNNIEST LEGEND TO TELL THE NEW GUY IN TOWN.

ORM	I’M SORRY, ROLLAN.

ROLLAN	OH, WHAT A FOOL I WAS!

ROLLAN	WAIT! HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS LEGEND ISN’T REALLY TRUE? ARE YOU THE VERY SAME LEGENDS FROM THE STORY?

ROLLAN	ARE YOU THE UNBELIEVABLE MIX OF AWESOMENESS AND POWER THAT THEY CALL KAI?!

ROLLAN	AND ARE YOU GERDA, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND HEROIC GIRL IN THE ENTIRE WORLD?

GERDA	YES!

KAI	NO!

GERDA	YES!!

KAI	NO! YOU PROMISED!

GERDA	YES! I PROMISED, BUT LYING ISN’T RIGHT!

KAI	ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR? BOTH YOU AND I DECIDED TO KEEP IT A SECRET, REMEMBER?

GERDA	HE ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION, SO I GAVE HIM A TRUTHFUL ANSWER!

KAI	I’VE HAD IT WITH PEOPLE LIKE HIM! NOW THEY’RE COMING ALL THE WAY FROM SPAIN TO LAUGH AT US! TO SEE THE CURIOSITIES! EVERYBODY THINKS THAT WE’RE LEGENDS, THAT WE LIVE THIS CHARMED LIFE! BUT WE DON’T! WE MOVE AROUND FROM TOWN TO TOWN LIKE VAGABONDS, ALL FOR CHUMP CHANGE! BUT NO MORE!

GERDA	THAT CHUMP CHANGE WAS ALL WE HAD TO LIVE ON. I CAN’T HIDE ANY LONGER, OR TELL PEOPLE LIES!

ALFIDA	STOP BICKERING, YOU TWO!

KAI	YOU’RE JUST A SELFISH NARCISSIST!

GERDA	AND YOU’RE JUST UNGRATEFUL!

KAI	ALL RIGHT, THEN GO! TELL EVERYONE ABOUT YOUR HEROIC FEATS! BUT WITHOUT ME!

GERDA	GOOD, MAYBE I WILL! BUT WHO’LL LOOK AFTER YOU?! LET’S FACE IT, YOU’RE PRETTY HELPLESS WITHOUT ME!

KAI	I DON’T NEED ANYONE TO LOOK AFTER ME! I DON’T NEED A SISTER!

GERDA	HUH! IF OUR PARENTS WERE HERE, YOU WOULD BEHAVE! 

KAI	BUT THEY AREN’T!

ALFIDA	WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

KAI	I’M BUZZING OFF! AWAY FROM HERE!

ALFIDA	IT’S MY SHIP.

KAI	THEN HELP ME!

ROLLAN	I JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW KAI CAN BEHAVE LIKE THAT! YOU SAVED HIS LIFE! IF SOMEBODY SAVED MY LIFE, I’D BE SERVING THEM PEELED GRAPES!

GERDA	I DON’T THINK KAI UNDERSTANDS HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR ME TO MAKE ENDS MEET WITHOUT OUR PARENTS AROUND.

KAI	SHE DIDN’T CARE ABOUT MY OPINION.

ALFIDA	YOUR SISTER LOVES YOU! SHE TRAVELLED HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD AND DEFEATED THE SNOW QUEEN IN ORDER TO SAVE YOU!

KAI	THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. SHE CHANGED A LOT SINCE THEN. NOW I THINK I’M JUST A BURDEN FOR HER.

GERDA	I TRIED TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIVING FOR THE BOTH OF US. BUT WITHOUT OUR PARENTS, I’M AFRAID I FAILED.

GERDA	KAI WAS EVERYTHING THAT I HAD.

KAI	FROM NOW ON, I CAN FEND FOR MYSELF! I’M LEAVING!

ALFIDA	HAVE YOU THOUGHT THAT THROUGH CAREFULLY?

KAI	YES. I THINK THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR THE BOTH OF US.

ROLLAN	I UNDERSTAND YOUR PAIN ABOUT YOUR PARENTS. YOU KNOW, I STUDY LEGENDS BECAUSE I’VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR MY LOST MOTHER, TOO.

GERDA	REALLY?!

ROLLAN	YES, IT’S STILL MY DEAREST WISH, TO SOMEDAY FIND HER. AND I THINK I CAN NOW! I KNOW HOW TO DO IT! BECAUSE THERE IS THIS TROLL LEGEND...

GERDA	WAIT! DID ORM TELL YOU THAT ONE, TOO?

ROLLAN	NO. LOOK AT THIS!

ROLLAN	IT’S CALLED THE WISHING STONE! IF A PERSON FINDS IT, AND MAKES THEIR DEAREST WISH UPON IT, IT WILL COME TRUE. I’VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT FOR A LONG TIME. THE TROLLS COULDN’T HELP ME, BECAUSE THEY DON’T KNOW WHERE IT IS.

GERDA	AMANA’S CAVES, LAKE GAO, THE TEMPLE... THE TROLLS ALL KNOW ABOUT THESE PLACES AS WELL. IT’S JUST FORBIDDEN TO GO THERE!

ROLLAN	FORBIDDEN?

GERDA	OF COURSE IT IS. YOU CAN GET CURSED, OR CAST SPELLS THERE, OR CAUSE TROUBLE TO THE WHOLE CITY, OR EVEN THE ENTIRE WORLD! 

GERDA	LET’S GO!

ROLLAN	WHERE?

GERDA	LET’S FIND THE WISHING STONE! YOU’RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A WISH TO MAKE! 

ROLLAN	BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE TABOOS AND CURSES?

GERDA	CHICKEN!

ROLLAN	I’D DO ANYTHING FOR MY MOTHER!

ROLLAN	IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING I’D EVER SEEN! I TOLD YOU THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM! THEY WERE TINY SMALL ELEMENTS! THAT’S HOW IT WAS!

GERDA	THAT’S HOW IT WAS!

GERDA	THIS MIRROR HELPED ME TO DEFEAT THE SNOW QUEEN.

GERDA	COME ON.

ROLLAN	YOU COME ON.

GERDA	THAT’S IT. WE’RE NOT TOURISTS ANY MORE, WE’RE PROFESSIONALS.

SOLDIERS	…RIGHT... NOW DO WHAT YOU’RE SAYING AGAIN.

SOLDIERS	…RIGHT A MAN SAW... RIGHT… YOU KNOW… THAT’S ALL VERY SAD

ROLLAN	DO YOU KNOW HOW TO ICE SKATE?

GERDA	NO.

ROLLAN	DON’T WORRY, I’LL TEACH YOU.

SHAMAN	HEY, DASHALAN, DASHALAN.

ATTENDANTS OF THE FIRE CULT	HEY, DASHALAN... HEY, DASHALAN, DASHALAN.

ROLLAN	TWO STONES! THERE IS ONLY ONE IN THE LEGEND! AND WE HAVE TWO!

GERDA	IT LOOKS TOO OMINOUS TO BE THE WISHING STONE! DOESN’T IT?

ROLLAN	WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT’S HERE TO SCARE THE TOURISTS. BUT WE’RE PROFESSIONALS!

ROLLAN	IT’S STUCK!

ROLLAN	MAYBE IT’S A TRAP?

GERDA	I DON’T SEE ANYTHING.

ROLLAN	I’LL CHECK IT OUT.

ROLLAN	WHAT THE--?

GERDA	ROLLAN!

ROLLAN	GERDA!

GERDA	WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?!

GERDA	ROLLAN! ROLLAN!

GERDA	ROLLAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

ROLLAN	I’M FINE! DON’T WORRY ABOUT ME! HOW ARE YOU?

GERDA	I’M FINE, TOO. I DON’T KNOW! WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?

ROLLAN	DO YOU SEE ANYTHING THERE AT ALL?

GERDA	YES, I FOUND SOMETHING!

ROLLAN	WHAT IS IT?

GERDA	I DON’T KNOW YET.

ROLLAN	WHAT’S GOING ON? GERDA?

ROLLAN	AAAAHH!

GERDA	MAYBE THIS?!

ROLLAN	OW! OUCH! AAAH! OW!

GERDA	ROLLAN, I’VE GOTTA GET YOU OUT OF THERE! HOLD ON!

GERDA	ROLLAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

ROLLAN	THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.

GERDA	YOU’RE WELCOME.

GERDA	WOW!

ROLLAN	MAGNIFICO!

GERDA	IT’S SO BEAUTIFUL!

GERDA	HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS PLACE?

ROLLAN	NO.

GERDA	ME NEITHER.

ROLLAN	IT MEANS NO ONE EVER MADE IT OUT OF HERE ALIVE!

ROLLAN	UH! GERDA! LOOK! THE WISHING STONE!

ROLLAN	I CAN’T BELIEVE IT! WE DID IT! WE FOUND IT!

GERDA	DEAR WISHING STONE, PLEASE MAKE MY PARENTS COME BACK.

ROLLAN	GLACIEM. VERSUS. IGNIS!

GERDA	WHAT’S HAPPENING?

ROLLAN	I DON’T KNOW! 

SNOW QUEEN, FIRE KING	YOU SHALL BE HOT LIKE FIRE, YOU SHALL BE COLD LIKE ICE. THE EVIL FORCE INSIDE YOU WILL LIKE A SLAVE RESIDE. BUT THE MOMENT A STAR APPEARS IN THE VIEW THE EVIL FORCE WILL MAKE A SLAVE OUT OF YOU!

GERDA	THE SNOW QUEEN!

SNOW QUEEN	AS SOON AS THE FIRST STAR APPEARS IN THE VIEW MY REIGN OVER THE EARTH WILL START ANEW!

HIPPIE	I GUESS HE JUST DOESN’T LIKE REGGAE.

HIPPIE	I GUESS NO DUDES HERE LIKES REGGAE. 

GERDA	AAH!

GERDA	ROLLAN!

GERDA	ROLLAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

ROLLAN	I’M NOT SURE. 

ROLLAN	AAH!

GERDA	OH MY GOSH!

ROLLAN	AWESOME! 

ROLLAN	GERDA, IS IT YOU? I WAS AFRAID, YOU LOOK LIKE THE SNOW QUEEN! HOW DID YOU DO IT?

ROLLAN	WHAT? WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE MY HEAD IS ON FIRE?

GERDA	WELL…

ROLLAN	AAAH!

GERDA	AAAH!

ROLLAN	WHAT’S HAPPENED TO US? IS IT NOT MY REFLECTION?

GERDA	THE STONE HAS SOMETHING MIXED UP! I JUST ASKED THE WISHING STONE TO MAKE MY PARENTS COME BACK!

ROLLAN	THOSE WERE YOUR PARENTS? YOU SHOULD’VE WARNED ME!

GERDA	DON’T BE STUPID. IT SEEMS THAT WAS THE SNOW QUEEN EMBODIED ME AND SOME KIND OF A FIRE DEMON GOT INTO YOU!

ROLLAN	IN ME? DEMON!? OH MY GOSH!

GERDA	WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

ROLLAN	I DON’T KNOW!

GERDA	THIS LOOKS NOTHING LIKE OUR WISHES COMING TRUE! 

ROLLAN	WHAT NOW?

GERDA	A LONG TIME AGO, ORM USED TO BE THE SNOW QUEEN’S SERVANT. HE SHOULD KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO US! HE’LL HELP US!

ROLLAN	ARE YOU SURE?

GERDA	ABSOLUTELY! AND IF I FIND OUT THAT HE TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS “WISHING STONE”, I’LL...

ROLLAN	GOT IT.

ORM	AAARGGHH!

DICTOR VOICE	UP! DOWN! UP! DOWN! UP! DOWN! VERY GOOD! NOW STRETCH! BACK STRAIGHT! JUST DOWN! NOW LET’S WORK THOSE GLUTES! AND ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO! SQUEEZE! YEAAH!

ORM	WHAT THE--?

RAHAT/LOKUM/TROLL-KIDS	HAHAHA! OH, THIS FEELS GREAT!

TROLL-KIDS	UNCLE ORM! UNCLE ORM!

RAHAT	HEY THERE, BUDDY! COME ON IN!

LOKUM	AWESOME!

ORM	WHAT’S THAT SMELL?

RAHAT	I DIDN’T DO IT!

LOKUM	ME NEITHER!

ORM	AND WHO?

ROLLAN	DO YOU THINK WE ARE STILL IN THE FORBIDDEN AREA?

GERDA	NO IDEA! KEEP QUIET!

SHAMAN	YOUR MAJESTY, THE CELEBRATION MUST BE CANCELLED! AND WE HAVE TO THINK OF HOW TO SAVE OUR LIVES!

KING ARROG 	THERE IS NO ESCAPING YOUR DESTINY! WE CAN’T SPREAD PANIC!

SHAMAN	BUT SOMEBODY DARED TO AWAKEN THE ANCIENT CURSE OF GAO LAKE! THE WHOLE WORLD IS IN DANGER!

ARROG	LONG AGO MY GRANDFATHER DIED ON THE BATTLEFIELD, TRYING TO FIGHT THE LAKE’S CURSE.

ARROG	TROLLS THEN HARDLY SURVIVED. AND NOW I’M GIVEN A CHANCE TO FULFILL HIS DESTINY.

SHAMAN	WHAT A FOOL DARED TO STEP INTO THESE FORBIDDEN CAVES?! 

ARROG	WE HAVE TO FIND HIM BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE! BUT HOW?

SHAMAN	WE’LL UNDERSTAND WHO IT IS ONCE WE SEE THEM!

ARROG	DO IT THEN! AND I’LL GO TO MY PEOPLE AND TRY TO CALM THEM DOWN.

GERDA	WHAT HAVE WE DONE?

GERDA	HURRY UP TO ORM! WE NEED TO GET EVERYTHING BACK TO NORMAL!

GERDA	WHAT’S MORE IMPORTANT, WE NEED TO DO THAT UNNOTICED!

GERDA	SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT OUR APPEARANCES TOO!

GERDA	WITH YOUR HAIR BURNING YOU WON’T GO FAR!

ROLLAN	AND YOU LOOK AMAZING!

GERDA	NO DOUBT! BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

TROLL IN AUDIENCE	YOU SEE IT?

ROLLAN	ENJOY THE SHOW!

ROLLAN	LOOK WHAT...

ROLLAN	OUCH! THAT HURTS!

GERDA	QUIET! IT WAS JUST SOME WATER!

ROLLAN	WATER? AH? IT WAS PAINFUL!

GERDA	PLEASE DON’T ATTRACT ATTENTION. THEY’LL NOTICE US BECAUSE OF YOU IN NO TIME!

ROLLAN	PHEW! NOBODY NOTICED US!

ARROG	GERDA?!

SHAMAN	YOUR HIGHNESS! THERE THEY ARE! IT’S THEM! THEY’RE THE CULPRITS!

GERDA	LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! TROLLS OF ALL AGES! WELCOME TO OUR ONE AND ONLY PERFORMANCE IN YOUR FAIR TOWN! THE FIRE AND ICE SHOW!

GERDA	FEATURING THAT LEGENDARY MASTER OF FIRE: ROLLAN!

ARROG	NONSENSE! THAT'S GERDA - THE ONE WHO SAVED US FROM THE SNOW QUEEN!

AUDIENCE	GERDA! GERDA! GERDA!

GERDA	I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A COOL HEAD, AH? NOW IT’S YOUR TURN. YOU DISTRACT THEM, AND I’LL FIND THE WAY OUT!

ARROG	WHAT ELSE DID YOU EXPECT FROM THIS CLUMSY CHUMP?

GERDA	HEY! COME ON!

TROLL IN AUDIENCE	ROLLAN THE LEGEND?! MORE LIKE ROLLAN THE LOSER HAHAHA!

SHAMAN	IT’S HIM!

AUDIENCE MEMBER #1	YAAAHHHHH!!!

SHAMAN	CAPTURE THEM!

GERDA	RUN!

GERDA	HURRY!

ARROG	CATCH THEM! I MUST KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON! IS THE CHAOS AND ANARCHY ALREADY STARTING?!!

GERDA	COME ON!

GERDA	IT’S OVER! WE’RE TRAPPED!

ROLLAN	HOLD ON TIGHT!

ROLLAN	JUST DON’T ASK HOW.

GERDA	HEE-HEE-HEE.

ROLLAN	WITH THE HELP OF THAT CARAVAN WE’LL GET OUT OF THE CITY.

ROLLAN	WATCH AND LEARN HOW TO HITCH A RIDE.

ROLLAN	HEY MISTER, WILL YOU GIVE US A LIFT?

HIPPIE	HI GERDA, HOW’S LIFE?

GERDA	IT COULD BE BETTER. WE NEED TO GET TO ORM’S AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE!

HIPPIE	COME ON IN, WE’RE ALSO LEAVING. NO ONE HERE LIKES REGGAE.

SOLDIERS	ALRIGHT, COME ON! WE’RE AFTER SEARCH TO THE WEST. HURRY! THIS WAY!

ARROG	I CAN’T BELIEVE IT WAS GERDA. SHE SAVED OUR LIVES!

SHAMAN	MAYBE SHE REGRETS DOING THAT. ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN’T OFFEND HER SOMEHOW?

ARROG	IS THAT THE JOKE?! YOU’RE A SHAMAN, NOT A CLOWN!  WHAT DO WE DO NOW? 

SHAMAN	I DON’T KNOW!

ARROG	YOU SHOULD KNOW! IF YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT GOOD ARE YOU?

SHAMAN	THERE IS ONE TRUSTWORTHY TEST THOUGH! 

ARROG	FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND REPORT BACK TO ME! 

ARROG	YOU HAVE FEW HOURS TILL EVENING! OTHERWISE YOU’LL BE A CLOWN FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!

GERDA	WHERE IS KAI NOW, I WONDER?

ROLLAN	I THINK HE REALIZED HE WAS WRONG, AND CAME BACK.

ALFIDA	HAVE YOU THOUGHT IT OVER? ARE YOU SURE YOU DON’T WANT TO GO BACK AND SAY GOODBYE? 

KAI	YES, IT’S ALL BEEN DECIDED. SHE DOESN’T NEED ME, AND I DON’T NEED HER EITHER! NOW I’M FREE LIKE THE WIND!

ORM	HURRY! EVERY MINUTE COUNTS! TAKE ONLY WHAT’S MOST IMPORTANT!

ROLLAN	GERDA, DON’T TAKE IT TOO MUCH TO HEART. HE HAS NOWHERE TO GO, BUT BACK TO YOU.

KAI	I'LL BE THE FIRST PIRATE PAINTER IN HISTORY! I’LL PAINT ALL THE GREAT SEA BATTLES! 

ORM	LIKE ALWAYS, CAN’T FIND IT WHEN YOU NEED IT! 

KAI	AH, GERDA... IT DOESN’T MEAN A THING TO ME WHAT HAPPENS TO HER NOW.

ROLLAN	CAN’T THIS THING GO ANY FASTER?

HIPPIE	SORRY, DUDE. ONLY THE DOOMSDAY ITSELF COULD MAKE OL’ HONEY RUN ANY FASTER!

ORM	HERE IT IS! FINALLY! LET’S GO! LET’S GO!

GERDA	UHHHH!

KAI	GERDA!!! NO!!!

GERDA	THEY’RE ALIVE! THANK GOODNESS, YOU’RE OKAY! BUT WHERE’S KAI?

ORM	WE’RE OKAY, BUT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE! 

ORM	THERE’S A CANYON UP AHEAD!

HIPPIE	NOTHIN’ FAZES ME, MAN. I’M LIKE, A TOTAL ZEN-MEISTER.

ROLLAN	GERDA!

RIKKI	HOORAY! HOORAY!

GERDA	EVERYONE ALIVE?

GERDA	WHERE’S KAI?

ORM	HE SAILED WITH ALFIDA. I HOPE THEY’RE OKAY.

ORM	GER-R-R-D-DA, ST-T-TOP IT!

GERDA	THANK YOU, ROLLAN.

ORM	CAN ANYBODY TELL ME WHAT’S GOING ON HERE? WHY ARE YOU SO COLD, HE’S SO HOT, AND I’M SO CONFUSED?

GERDA	THAT’S WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW! WAS IT YOU WHO TOLD ROLLAN ABOUT THE WISHING STONE? WAS IT SOME KIND OF A JOKE? WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, NOBODY’S LAUGHING!

ORM	WHO TOLD HIM WHAT? I’VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT ANY WISHING STONE IN MY LIFE!

GERDA	ROLLAN, GIVE ME THAT PICTURE!

ROLLAN	I LOST IT! OR BURNED IT ACCIDENTLY. I CAN’T REMEMBER WHICH. WELL, ABOUT 80% THAT I LOST IT, AND 20% THAT I BURNED IT.

GERDA	ARGH! THE WISHING STONE! IN THE FORBIDDEN CAVE!

HIPPIE, ORM	AH-H-H-H!!!

GERDA	UNDERNEATH LAKE GAO!

HIPPIE	HUH??! YOU’RE FREAKIN’ ME OUT, MAN!!

GERDA	WE FOUND IT!!!

ORM	A-A-A-AH!!! 

GERDA	EXCEPT, WE DIDN’T GET WHAT WE WISHED FOR. INSTEAD, SPIRITS OF THE SNOW QUEEN AND THE FIRE KING GOT OUT OF THE WISHING STONE AND POSSESSED ROLLAN AND ME! 

HIPPIE, ORM, HORSE	A-A-A-AH!!! 

HIPPIE	A-A-A-AH!!! OH, OL’ HONEY, THE APOCALYPSE IS COMING!!!

ROLLAN	APPARENTLY HE’S NOT AS ZEN- LIKE AS HE THOUGHT.

?R?	WHY DID YOU ENTER THE FORBIDDEN CAVES? DON’T YOU REALIZE THERE’S A GOOD REASON WHY THEY’RE FORBIDDEN?!

GERDA	WE’LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER! LET’S FOCUS ON WHAT WE’RE GOING TO DO NOW!

?R?	HOW SHOULD I KNOW? WHAT AM I, «WIKI-ORM» ?

GERDA	I WAS SURE YOU'D HELP US.

?R?	MAYBE I COULD, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!

ORM	WHAT’S WITH YOU? WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING HERE?

ROLLAN	WE’RE WASTING OUR TIME, THAT’S WHAT’S HAPPENING TO US!

ROLLAN	WITH THE RISE OF THE FIRST STAR, OUR TRANSFORMATION WILL BE COMPLETE!

ROLLAN	LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DOOMED...

?R?	ARE YOU SERIOUS? IF YOU KEPT YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN MORE, YOU WOULDN’T BE SO DARN GULLIBLE! YOU BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU HEAR! YOU’RE LIKE A CHILD! YOU SHOULD TRY SPENDING MORE TIME IN THE LIBRARY, RESEARCHING YOUR FACTS!

ROLLAN	I'M TO BLAME!? IT WAS YOU WHO PULLED THE WOOL OVER MY EYES!

GERDA	DID YOU SAY, YOU HAVE A LIBRARY?

?R?	OF COURSE WE DO! WE’RE TROLLS, NOT SOME SORT OF ILLITERATE GOBLINS! 

GERDA	AND YOU HAVE LEGENDS THERE?!

?R?	NO, ONLY SILLY COMICS BOOKS.

?R?	OF COURSE THERE ARE LEGENDS THERE! ALL THE TROLL LEGENDS ARE GATHERED THERE! 

GERDA	HURRY UP THEN! WE NEED TO GET TO YOUR LIBRARY!

ROLLAN	BUT HOW? EVEN IF WE MAKE IT BEFORE SUNSET, WE'LL GET CAUGHT IN NO TIME! WE’RE RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THEIR “MOST WANTED” LIST!

GERDA	DON’T WORRY! WE’LL MAKE IT THROUGH ALRIGHT! IT’S OUR ONLY HOPE!

ROLLAN	LOOK AT THAT! A LOCOMOTIVE MADE OF ICE!

ROLLAN	ALRIGHT! WE’LL SMASH OUR WAY INTO THE CITY! WE’LL KNOCK THEM OUT LEFT AND RIGHT! HUH! HUH! TAKE THAT! WATCH OUT, ROLLAN THE LEGEND!

GERDA	NAH, LET’S USE IT AS A DISTRACTION, AND GET INTO THE LIBRARY INSTEAD!

GERDA	ALL ABOARD! YOUR SEAT NUMBERS ARE ON YOUR TICKETS. 

ARROG	HURRY UP! WE NEED MORE WATER, QUICKLY! 

MARIBEL	HURRY UP! PUT OUT THE FIRE, QUICKLY! 

MARIBEL	I SIMPLY MUST HAVE THOSE TRENDY PINK SHOES!

ARROG	MOVE IT!

ARROG	HAVE THEY FOUND GERDA YET?

SHAMAN	WE’RE LOOKING FOR THEM, BUT WE NEED MORE HELP. HALF THE CITY IS ON FIRE! 

ARROG	IF WE DON’T FIND THEM SOON, THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL BE ON FIRE!

ARROG	THEY’RE GETTING AWAY! SEIZE THEM!

MARIBEL	BUT WHAT ABOUT MY SHOES?!

HIPPIE	ONE, TWO, PULL! ONE, TWO, PULL! 

HIPPIE	PIRATES?! OH NO! THEY HATE REGGAE!

KAI	FOR REAL? DO YOU REALLY HATE REGGAE?

ALFIDA	CAN’T BEAR THE SOUND!

KAI	RAHAT, HAVE YOU SEEN GERDA?

RAHAT	YOU CAN’T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER!

ROLLAN	ARE YOU SURE THIS IS A LIBRARY? IT LOOKS MORE LIKE SOME KIND OF BAKERY TO ME!

ORM	EXCUSE ME, CAN YOU TELL ME--

ORM	GRANDMA?!

GRANDMA	ORM, SWEETIE?!

ORM	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

GRANDMA	NOW THIS LIBRARY IS MINE! I’M TRYING TO PROVE THE SCIENTIFIC THEORY THAT DIGESTING COOKIES HELPS YOU LEARN NEW MATERIAL. 

GRANDMA	WHO’S THAT WITH YOU? IS THAT GERDA?! AND WHO IS THAT? 

GERDA	THIS IS ROLLAN.

GRANDMA	YOUR BOYFRIEND?

GERDA	HEH, NO.

ORM	GRAMS, WHERE IS THE MAGIC STONES AND LEGENDS SECTION?

GRANDMA	YOU NEED THE MAGIC SECTION. 

GRANDMA	BUT BE CAREFUL AND DON’T FORGET TO FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS!

GRANDMA	THIS ELEVATOR WILL TAKE YOU STRAIGHT TO THE MAGIC SECTION.

GRANDMA	ALL LIKE SOUP AND COOKIES.

TROLL-KIDS	YEAH! WE DO! HOORAY! YAY, GRAMS!

GERDA, ROLLAN, ORM	AAAAAHHHH!!!

GERDA, ROLLAN, ORM	AAAAAHHHH!!!

GERDA	WHERE ARE ALL THOSE BOOKS AND SCROLLS?

ORM	THIS IS THE MAGIC SECTION! WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?

GERDA	SUCH MAGIC IN HERE! THERE IT IS! DOUBLE-U, DOUBLE-U, DOUBLE-U, WISHING STONE DOT TROLL. EDITED BY PROFESSOR TROLLOLO. WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY MEAN?

ROLLAN	SOME KIND OF NONSENSE!

ORM	YOU’RE “SOME KIND OF NONSENSE.” AND THAT’S A LINK! HELP ME OUT HERE, PLEASE! 

ORM	I’LL FIND THE LINK, AND YOU FIND THE NUMBER!

GERDA	IT’S NUMBER ONE!

ORM	I’M READY!

ROLLAN	SO ARE WE!

ROLLAN	NOW WHAT?

ORM	THAT SHOULD HAVE WORKED!

ROLLAN	WE’RE WASTING OUR TIME!

ORM	DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS?

ROLLAN	YOU DRAGGED US HERE! THE WORLD IS IN DANGER, THERE’S NO TIME! HEY, LET’S GO TO THE LIBRARY!

GERDA	STOP IT!

ROLLAN	WHAT’S NEXT, GENIUS? THE AQUARIUM? OR THE THEATRE? OH, MAYBE A FASHION SHOW?!

ORM	IT’S NOT MY FAULT THAT YOU STUCK YOUR NOSES WHERE YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE!

ROLLAN	YOUR BIG NOSE SURELY KNOWS WHERE WE SHOULDN’T HAVE STUCK OURS... “SAUSAGE-NOSE!”

ORM	I’LL POKE YOU WITH MY “SAUSAGE-NOSE,” AND IT WON’T BE PRETTY!

GERDA	PLEASE…

ROLLAN	GIVE IT A TRY! HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR SAUSAGE NOSE TO BE COOKED? MEDIUM-RARE OR WELL-DONE? 

GERDA	STOP IT ALREADY! YOU’RE AS BAD AS EACH OTHER!

SNOW QUEEN, FIRE DEMON	IF YOU DESIRE TO AWAKEN THE ELEMENTS AND TO SEE THE WORLD DESCEND INTO CHAOS... THEN YOU MUST HURRY ON! SAY “GLACIEM. VERSUS. IGNIS!”  AND TOUCH THE WISHING STONE! YOU SHALL BE HOT LIKE FIRE, YOU SHALL BE COLD LIKE ICE. THE EVIL FORCE INSIDE YOU WILL LIKE A SLAVE RESIDE. BUT THE MOMENT A STAR APPEARS IN THE VIEW THE EVIL FORCE WILL MAKE A SLAVE OUT OF YOU! IF YOU DESIRE TO FREE THE WORLD FROM THE CHAOS AND RESTRAIN IN THE STONE THE EVIL FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS THEN HURRY! YOU MUST RETURN! SAY “PACEM. BONIS. VENIS!!” AND TOUCH THE WISHING STONE!

GERDA	IT’S THAT SIMPLE? BUT WE MUST HURRY, WE ONLY HAVE ONE HOUR LEFT! 

SHAMAN	YOUR TIME IS UP! SEIZE THEM!

ROLLAN	WE’LL SEE.

SHAMAN	AH! WHAT’S THAT?

ROLLAN	A-A-ACHOO!!

ROLLAN	WHAT’S THAT?

SHAMAN	IT’S JUST OLD-FASHIONED PEPPER. NO MAGIC AT ALL. 

GERDA	LET US GO!  WE’RE IN A BIG HURRY! 

SHAMAN	THERE IS A SIMPLE WAY TO GET THINGS BACK TO NORMAL!

ARROG	STOP! SET THEM FREE IMMEDIATELY!

SHAMAN	YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND! WE WILL ALL DIE BECAUSE OF THESE TWO!

ARROG	IT’S YOU WHO DON’T UNDERSTAND!

ARROG	MY GRANDFATHER USED TO SOLVE ALL HIS PROBLEMS WITH POWER... IT LED TO THE TROLL PEOPLE NEARLY DYING OUT.

ARROG	WHEREAS GERDA SAVED US WHEN OUR POWERS SEEMED USELESS.

ARROG	I’M NOT FOLLOWING IN MY GRANDFATHER’S STEPS. WE WON’T FIGHT EVIL WITH EVIL.

ARROG	INSTEAD LET’S HELP THEM! THIS IS MY WILL!

TROLL GUARDS	HOORAY! LONG LIVE GERDA! LONG LIVE THE KING! HOORAY!

ARROG	GERDA, I BELIEVE IN YOU WITH ALL MY HEART AND I ALSO BELIEVE YOU’LL DO IT!

ARROG	BUT I CAN’T BE THAT SURE IN HIM.

ARROG	UNDERSTOOD... THEN YOU HAVE TO HURRY UP, THE SUN IS SETTING.

ARROG	IF YOU DON’T DO IT BEFORE THE TIME, I’LL HAVE TO GIVE MY FINAL ORDER...

MARIBEL	IT LOOKS SO MARVELOUS THAT I NEARLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT PAIR OF SHOES!

MARIBEL	AH! SOLDIERS! OUR MOTHERLAND IS IN DANGER!

GERDA	I FEEL I’M TURNING INTO THE SNOW QUEEN.

ROLLAN	HOLD ON! I’M WITH YOU!

KAI	GRANDMA ROSA! DO YOU KNOW WHERE GERDA AND ORM ARE?

GRANDMA	I FORGOT! MAYBE A CUP OF CAMOMILE TEA? 

SOLDIER	THAT WAY!

KAI	RUN!

SOLDIERS	RIGHT NOW! THIS WAY! COME ON! HURRY UP! HURRY UP! COME ON! RUN!

GERDA	PACEM. BONIS. VENIS!

GERDA	ROLLAN, IT WORKED! WE DID IT!

GERDA	ROLLAN?

GERDA	OH, ROLLAN! IT DIDN’T WORK?! THE SPELL HAD NO EFFECT ON YOU! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

ROLLAN	OH, NO! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? THE MAGIC DIDN’T WORK! THE SPELL HAD NO EFFECT ON ME! 

ROLLAN	WELL, WHAT IF I DIDN’T WANT THE SPELL TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON ME? 

GERDA	WHAT?! I DON’T UNDERSTAND YOU...

ROLLAN	WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I WANTED TO BE A SUPERHERO. BUT WHEN I GREW UP, I REALIZED - I JUST WANTED TO BE SUPER! AND I DIDN’T CARE IF I WAS A SUPERHERO OR A SUPERVILLAN!

GERDA	WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM? YOU SAID THE ONLY REASON YOU STUDIED LEGENDS WAS SO THAT YOU COULD FIND HER!

ROLLAN	THE ONLY REASON I STUDIED LEGENDS WAS TO FIND THE WAY TO OBTAIN SUPERPOWERS! AND I GOT THEM!

ROLLAN	MAMA’S FINE. I LIED ABOUT HER, SIMPLY TO WIN YOUR TRUST!

GERDA	HOW COULD YOU LIE LIKE THAT ABOUT YOUR OWN MOTHER?!

ROLLAN	ACTUALLY IT’S EASY, WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

GERDA	YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING! WE HAVE TO STOP THIS!

ROLLAN	“STOP IT”?! HAHA! YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED ME WHILE YOU STILL HAD YOUR MAGIC POWERS! BUT YOU’RE THINKING ONLY ABOUT LOVE! 

GERDA	YOU’RE SUCH A FOOL!

ROLLAN	I’M A FOOL? COULD YOU REMIND ME, WHO OF US TOOK A STRANGER’S ADVICE, INSTEAD OF YOUR BROTHER’S? AND HE WARNED YOU ABOUT ME! IT’S NOT BY ACCIDENT THAT HE RAN AWAY FROM SUCH A SELFISH GIRL!

GERDA	IT’S NOT A GIFT! IT’S A CURSE! YOU’LL LOSE YOURSELF! THIS FORCE WILL DESTROY YOU!

GERDA	OWWWWW!!

ROLLAN	NO, THIS FORCE WILL DESTROY YOU! AND I’LL BECOME ROLLAN THE LEGEND! FOREVER!

KAI	ORM WHERE IS GERDA? 

ORM	SHE MUST BE WITH ROLLAN.

CAPTAIN	HEY! STOP RIGHT THERE!

ROLLAN	MY NAME IS ROLLAN! AND I AM A LEGEND IN THESE PARTS.

SHAMAN	STOP HIM, BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE! 

ROLLAN	IT IS TOO LATE!

SHAMAN	NOOOOO!

ROLLAN	R-R-R-O-O-A-A-R-R-R-R!!!

SOLDIERS	WHAT’S HAPPENING?

SHAMAN	AAAAAHH!!

ARROG	ATTACK!

ARROG	LINE UP THE ARTILLERY!!

ALFIDA	THERE’S NO WAY!

KAI	GERDA!!!

GERDA	HUH?

KAI	GERDA-A-A! GERDA-A-A! GERDA-A-A!

GERDA	KAI?!

KAI	GERDA!

GERDA	GO BACK! YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO HELP ME! IT’S ONLY MY FAULT! GO BACK!

GERDA	SAVE YOURSELF!

ALFIDA	SHE’S RIGHT. YOU WON’T MAKE IT ACROSS! THAT’S THE ROAD TO DEATH! 

GERDA	KAI! YOU CAME TO SAVE ME! 

KAI	YOU’RE MY SISTER! AND I’LL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK, TOO!

ALFIDA	HOLD ON! I’LL GET YOU OUT OF THERE!

ARROG	DIRECT FIRE ON THE FIRE! FIRE!

CROWD	AAAAAAH! MADNESS! NOOOO! GO! WHAT IS THAT? GO BACK! AAAAAAAH!

ALFIDA	ARE YOU OK?

ARROG	FALL BACK! WE’RE RETREATING!

GERDA	BUT YOUR MAJESTY, YOU CAN’T RETREAT!

ARROG	GERDA?!

GERDA	WE HAVE TO STOP HIM! OTHERWISE, THE DESTRUCTION HE’S GOING TO CAUSE WILL MAKE THE SNOW QUEEN LOOK LIKE A SWEET LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL!

ARROG	IDIOTS, SAVE THE QUEEN!

MARIBEL	NOOO! MY PRECIOUS!

KAI	WHAT ELSE CAN WE THROW AT HIM?

ARROG	RIGHT NOW THERE’S NOTHING WE CAN DO!

ARROG	OUR WEAPONS ARE USELESS TO DEFEAT HIM!

BURNING SOLDIER	AAAAAHHH!

BURNING SOLDIER	THANK YOU!

GERDA	YOU DON’T NEED TO DEFEAT HIM! YOU NEED TO PUT HIM OUT!

ARROG	YES, WE’VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT HIM OUT FOR A WHOLE HOUR! IT’S OBVIOUSLY NOT WORKING!

GERDA	I MEAN, YOU NEED TO WATER HIM! 

ARROG	WHAT?

GERDA	OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! YOU NEED TO EXTINGUISH HIM!

ARROG		WHAT?! GERDA, YOU’RE A GENIUS! IF THIS WORKS, I’M GOING TO MAKE YOU A GENERAL! YOU’LL BE FAT AND RICH, AND ABLE TO BOSS EVERYBODY AROUND!

WINEMAKER	CAREFUL, YOU! THIS IS 220-YEAR-OLD LOTO TROLLOLO! EVERY DROP OF IT IS PRECIOUS!

ARROG	QUICK! TAKE IT ALL!

ARROG	I HOPE HE CAN FULLY APPRECIATE THE COMPLEX BOUQUET! 

ARROG	LOAD! READY! FIRE!

GERDA	IT WORKED! HE’S DOWN!

ARROG	EXCELLENT SWILL! HEY YOU! I NEED A COUPLE OF BARRELS DELIVERED FOR MY NEXT PARTY!

ARROG	WATER THIS RASCAL DOWN!

GERDA	LOAD!

GERDA	JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE, AND WE’LL KNOCK HIM DOWN INTO THE LAKE!

ARROG	FINISH HIM!

SOLDIER	ANYMORE LEFT?

KAI	WE’RE OUT OF BARRELS!

ARROG	WHAT?!

ARROG	STEP BACK! LET’S GET OUT OF HERE!

GERDA	COME ON! HE’S MOVING FASTER!

KAI	LOOK OUT!

GERDA	AAAAA!

ALFIDA	GERDAAAA!

GERDA	KAI, NO…

ORM	I CAN’T BELIEVE SHE’S GONE! SHE WAS SO BRAVE!

ALFIDA	AYE, THAT SHE WAS! A BRAVER LASS NEVER WALKED THE FACE OF THE EARTH! AND SHE DESERVED A FAR BETTER FATE THAN DAVY JONES’ LOCKER!

ARROG	SHE SAVED US AGAIN! I HEREBY PRONOUNCE HER “GENERALISSIMO GERDA!”

KAI	I NEVER THANKED HER FOR EVERYTHING SHE DID FOR ME. THANK YOU, GERDA. 

GERDA	IT’S BEEN MY PLEASURE, KAI, DON’T MENTION IT. 

KAI	FUNNY, I CAN ALMOST STILL HEAR HER SWEET, KIND, GENTLE VOICE...

ORM	ME TOO! IT’S ALMOST SPOOKY-LIKE.

GERDA	DID ANYONE THINK ABOUT JUMPING IN THERE TO GO LOOK FOR ME?

ORM	NO, BECAUSE THERE’S NO WAY THAT YOU COULD HAVE SURVIVED THAT FALL.

GERDA	ACTUALLY, I MIGHT BEG TO DIFFER...

KAI	SHE’S RIGHT! I’VE GOTTA TRY ANYWAY!

KAI	GERDA! YOU’RE ALIVE!

KAI	I’M SO SORRY I TOLD YOU I DIDN’T NEED YOU.

GERDA	FORGIVE ME, PLEASE! YOU WERE RIGHT! I WAS SO EGOTISTICAL. FROM NOW ON, YOU CAN CALL US HANSEL AND GRETEL!

KAI	IT DOESN’T MATTER NOW! YOU’RE MY FAMILY, ALTHOUGH IT’S ONLY A SMALL ONE, IT’S ALL THAT MATTERS.

GERDA	BROTHER!

ARROG, ORM, SOLDIERS	HOORAY! YES! HAHAHAHA!

ARROG	WHAT MAKES ME REALLY CONFUSED IS THAT HOW THIS FRAGILE GIRL CAN BE SUCH A BRAVE SOLIDER AT HEART!

SHAMAN	YOU ACTED VERY INSIGHTFULLY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, YOUR MAJESTY... YOUR GRANDFATHER WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY PROUD OF YOU!

ARROG	YOU THINK SO?

SHAMAN	EVERYONE THINKS SO!

CROWD	FANTASTIC! WE THINK SO! WE THINK SO! WE THINK SO! YAHOO!

OFFICER	WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THEM? THROW THEM INTO THE LAKE?

ARROG	WHY THROW THEM INTO THE LAKE? THROW THEM INTO THE FURNACE! WE’LL PUT THEM ALL TO WORK!

EMBERS	YAY! HOORAY! UNION JOBS!

CROWD	HOOORAY! LET IT HAPPEN! YES! YAHOO! YEAAAH! 

CROWD	BYE! BLESS YOU! BLESS YOU! BLESS YOU! BYE!..

ALFIDA	SO THIS IS WHAT YOU ASKED THE WISHING STONE TO GIVE YOU?

ALFIDA	TO MAKE THE TROLLS PRESENT US WITH THIS HUGE PILE OF GOLD?

GERDA	OF COURSE NOT! THAT MUST BE KING ARROG’S GIFT! I THINK HE’S THANKFUL THAT THIS WHOLE STORY ENDED UP WELL... AND NOW WE’RE SAILING AWAY!

KAI	TELL ME HONESTLY, WHAT YOU WISHED FOR WHEN YOU FOUND THE WISHING STONE?

GERDA	I WISHED FOR OUR PARENTS TO RETURN. UNFORTUNATELY, THE LEGEND ABOUT THE WISHING STONE WAS A LIE.


GERDA	FATHER!

UNA	GERDA!

MASTER VEGARD	KAI! 

UNA	KAI!

GERDA	MOTHER!

MASTER VEGARD	GERDA!

UNA	WE MISSED YOU!
