ISSIE	Do you think she’s ready?

TOM	That’s the first time you’ve asked the right question. Give it a try.

NATASHA	What?

CAROLINE	No way.

ISSIE	Why is Dan so hung up on this internship thing anyway?

CAROLINE	He’s always been obsessed with being a vet.

SAM	Julia. Get back to me please.

IC	He doesn’t know yet?

JULIA	He doesn’t need to know.

KENNY	And looking very smart there, the Dulmoth ladies.

BIANCA	This place is, the worst.

CALEB	I’m, I’m gay. You can’t tell anyone though.

ISSIE	You, you haven’t told anyone else?

ISSIE	I have these dreams, about a ship, there are horses.

NANNY RUTH	There was a shipwrecked here. The horses, they made it to land though, but they died out long ago.

ISSIE	I think they might still be here.

ANISHA	Hey Is, you look terrible.

ISSIE	Thanks.

ANISHA	Were you asleep?

ISSIE	Yeah. Just had this really insane dream.

ANISHA	Was it the one where you’re a Blue Peter presenter?

ISSIE	No, I haven’t had that since I was eleven. This was about an old railway track.

ANISHA	Oh yeah.

ISSIE	And the, the horse was on it.

ANISHA	The ghost horse? Again? Babe, it sounds like you’re losing it.

ISSIE	No, I’m not. Dreams can be signs.

ANISHA	And now you’ve gone all spiritual.

ISSIE	No I haven’t.

ANISHA	Hilarious.

ISSIE	Ok, well I need to go, so.

ANISHA	Ok.

ISSIE	See ya.

ANISHA	Yeah.

AMANDA	Issie.

JAKE	Hey. Mum said you hadn’t had any brekkie.

JAKE	What’s all this?

DAN	Revision. For the Equine First Aid test today.

JAKE	Oh, I don’t know why you put yourself through it all.

DAN	So I can apply for the internship in Australia, Dad.

JAKE	Oh, go on then, I’ll test ya. Ok. Uh. How many, legs, has a horse got?

DAN	Oh, funny Dad, thanks.

JAKE	Oh, come on, I mean, what are your chances of actually getting this internship anyway? Sounds like a long shot to me.

DAN	Thanks for that.

JAKE	I’m just trying to save you some heartache, son.

JAKE	What, you’re off to take it now?

DAN	Oh, it’s not till three, I’ve just got a bunch of chores at the stables first.

JAKE	Oh, good luck, Einstein.

DAN	What’s the point? Forget it.

NATASHA	No way.

CALEB	Check out that water jump.

NICOLE	Keep the propulsion.

NATASHA	Bianca’s gonna take it. So this is what they’ve been hiding. Oh, trust Dulmoth Park.

CALEB	Caroline will hate that.

NATASHA	Everyone will hate that.

NICOLE	You’ve so got this competition in the bag.

CALEB	Ok, so she’s like, not phased at all.

BIANCA	So easy.

BIANCA	Hey. Are you two spying on u?

NATASHA	Come on, run.

CAROLINE	Hey.

ISSIE	Do you know where, is there a railway track around here?

CAROLINE	Yeah, I think there’s supposed to be an old logging track.

ISSIE	Oh, really? Where is it?

CAROLINE	Um. Not sure. Somewhere out in the forest, I think.

CAROLINE	Around, here. Maybe. Why?

ISSIE	I just thought I’d, check it out. Ok, I kind of saw it.

CAROLINE	In a vision? Cool. What happened?

ISSIE	Well, there was a railway track, and Blaze was there, oh, and loads of the other.

CAROLINE	What do you mean? Others?

ISSIE	Other horses like her.

CAROLINE	Like a herd?

ISSIE	Yeah, I guess.

CAROLINE	Are you saying Blaze is wild?

ISSIE	Maybe.

CAROLINE	Oh, like, the Kauri Point herd, they’re a myth.

ISSIE	I’m still gonna look for them. I feel like I’m supposed to or something.

CAROLINE	Ok.

ISSIE	I can cycle up here, right?

CAROLINE	Up there? No way. Hey, you should take Blaze. She’d be like a tracker.

ISSIE	But I’ve never gone out of the stables on Blaze. I mean, without Tom.

CAROLINE	You’ll be sweet, I’ll come with you.

ISSIE	Really?

CAROLINE	Yeah, let’s go find us some ghost horses.

NATASHA	Trust them to put a water jump in the cross country trials. Where is everyone?

CALEB	Oh, maybe they’re practicing for it.

CAROLINE	Yo.

CALEB	Where are you?

CAROLINE	Issie had a vision and Blaze might be part of the Kauri Point herd so we’ve taken Blaze and Treacle out to find them.

CALEB	Did you say, Blaze. Issie’s on Blaze?

CAROLINE	Oh, do you know where the old logging track is?

CALEB	What logging track?

CAROLINE	The one that Dad used to go on about, the one they used to take out the Kauri forest?

CALEB	Oh, isn’t it out by the swim hole?

CAROLINE	Swim hole, oh yeah, ok, cool, thanks.

CALEB	No, but Caroline…

NATASHA	Hey.

DAN	What?

CALEB	So, apparently my sister’s gone off to find the Kauri Point herd with Issie.

NATASHA	I thought the Kauri Point herd died off, like, ages ago.

CALEB	Well I thought so, apparently Issie’s had a, vision.

NATASHA	And Issie’s gone on Blaze.

DAN	She’s riding Blaze? That horse is totally unpredictable.

CALEB	She thinks Blaze is one of the herd, so.

DAN	What?

CALEB	It, yeah, it sounds pretty nuts.

DAN	Well then, better go after them.

CALEB	Don’t you have your exam today?

DAN	Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, no, it’s not till later.

CAROLINE	You ok?

ISSIE	Yeah. Yeah. Just trying to remember everything Dan said. Heel’s down, thumbs on top, eyes, open. I know I’m going slow, sorry.

CAROLINE	You just gotta believe you’re an amazing rider. You gotta relax.

ISSIE	Yeah, that’s easy for you to say.

CAROLINE	Just fake it till you make it. That’s what I did.

ISSIE	Wow, it’s amazing you guys can, do this. Just.

CAROLINE	What?

ISSIE	Take off on a horse, go where the wind takes you kind of thing. It’s so peaceful.

CALEB	Caroline. Oi.

NATASHA	Caught you.

ISSIE	Oh look, what are they doing here?

DAN	The joy riders.

ISSIE	Hey.

NATASHA	Stella not with you?

CAROLINE	Nah, Hamish has a game today.

ISSIE	It’s a bit unfair isn’t it, how she has to go to all of his a million games.

NATASHA	Yeah, and he never comes to watch her ride.

CAROLINE	Well, that might change soon.

ISSIE	Why?

CAROLINE	I, kind of rarked him up at the Marae.

DAN	Did you?

CAROLINE	What are you all doing here anyway?

CALEB	We could ask the same of you, you lunatics.

ISSIE	Well, it’s my fault. I think Blaze has a herd and I think they’re around here.

NATASHA	Yeah, we heard you had one of your visions.

DAN	Come on then, let’s check it out.

ISSIE	You guys are coming?

DAN	Yeah, of course.

ISSIE	Hard out.

CALEB	Hard out. Look at you, blending in.

ISSIE	Yep, Kiwi as.

CALEB	Kiwi as.

ISSIE	Hey, are you still blending?

CALEB	Yeah. Not ready to, shout about it yet. Caroline’s the loud one.

ISSIE	Hmm. Well, be the proud one. Come on Blaze. Come on.

CAROLINE	How come you and Issie are like besties all of a sudden?

CALEB	We’re not, we’re just friends.

NATASHA	I mean, we were kind of spying on them.

CALEB	And the course looked really tough.

NATASHA	There’s this hideous water jump.

CAROLINE	Really?

ISSIE	Why? Is that a bad thing?

CAROLINE	Can be, I mean, you don’t want to fall off in it.

NATASHA	And Dulmoth Park are smashing it.

DAN	It’s ok. We’ve got Caroline.

CAROLINE	Yeah. Don’t worry, guys. I can take Bianca.

CALEB	Hey Is. You’re about to see the swimming hole.

DAN	Seriously, it’s awesome.

NATASHA	Yeah, get ready to be totally blown away.

CALEB	Oh.

DAN	No swimming. Contaminated water. If contact with skin occurs, seek medical advice.

NATASHA	What?

CAROLINE	Could be an algae bloom?

DAN	Nah it doesn’t look like an algae bloom.

CALEB	It must’ve just happened. We were here like a month ago.

CAROLINE	That is so sad, I grew up in this swimhole. You know what I mean.

CALEB	Yeah, good call, Is.

ISSIE	Hang on, what is that?

CALEB	They’re bees.

ISSIE	They’re all dead.

CALEB	I’m not surprised. Probably drank the water.

ISSIE	I wonder if that’s why Gran’s bees have been dying.

CAROLINE	That is so sad.

NATASHA	Why? I mean, it’s just a bunch of dead bees.

CALEB	Natasha. Bees are critical. They pollinate  per cent of the food that you eat, and  per cent of flowering plants.

CAROLINE	Yeah and he’s  per cent boring facts.

CALEB	What?

CAROLINE	That’s why he’s so good at exams.

CALEB	And I work hard. How do you think I know all the facts?

CAROLINE	I don’t know? You were born like that. Like, a tiny, baby Einstein.

NATASHA	Hey Dan, your test. We’ve got to get back.

DAN	No, I told you, it’s not till later.

NATASHA	Ok. I’m just reminding you.

ISSIE	Hey. Over here.

ISSIE	Guys, I think I found it.

DAN	So, this is the place?

ISSIE	No, but.

CAROLINE	Let’s follow it.

DAN	Anything seem familiar?

ISSIE	No, not really, maybe a bit further along.

NATASHA	Oh, the track just ended. Maybe we should head back.

ISSIE	But, I… easy Blaze, easy Blaze, easy Blaze, no, no, no, no…

CAROLINE	Issie!

ISSIE	Caroline! Please help. Please.

CAROLINE	Relax. Just relax.

ISSIE	I can’t.

CAROLINE	Loosen the reins and then try hold the mane.

ISSIE	Caroline, I can’t, help

CAROLINE	She’s feeling your tension. Just breathe.

ISSIE	Easy Blaze, easy.

CAROLINE	There you go, great.

ISSIE	Caroline, please.

CAROLINE	You’re leaning back, don’t lean back, and keep your legs under you. That’s it. There you go. Great, well done.

CAROLINE	I can’t believe how fast Blaze is.

DAN	Nice one, London.

ISSIE	Wait.

ISSIE	Hang on. This is it. This is the place.

ISSIE	Blaze and the other horses, they were right here, weren’t you?

CAROLINE	I can’t believe she brought you here. That’s incredible.

NATASHA	So, where are they? This, herd.

ISSIE	I don’t know. I don’t understand. This is definitely the place I saw.

CALEB	I have Deja vu all the time. I always think I’ve been places before when I haven’t.

ISSIE	No, but.

CAROLINE	Yeah, brains are weird.

ISSIE	Sure.

ISSIE	Wait, wait. Look. Horsehair.

CAROLINE	And there’s more over here.

ISSIE	Chewed bark. They were here.

CAROLINE	Wait. I think she’s right.

ISSIE	See, they do exist. But they’ve gone now.

CAROLINE	They might come back. Maybe we should leave Blaze here.

ISSIE	Yeah, but what if they don’t?

DAN	Yeah, I don’t think they’ve been here for a while.

NATASHA	Look, they’re not here now, and Dan needs to get back for his test.

ISSIE	Oh, yeah. But, we can’t just forget about the herd.

NATASHA	This place is huge, we’d be wandering around for days.

CAROLINE	Hey Issie, we could get our Dad’s drone

CALEB	Good luck asking for that.

CAROLINE	It’s in a box in the garage, Mum confiscated it, we can fly it over the forest, that’ll be much better.

ISSIE	That would be amazing. Thanks.

NATASHA	Come on then.

ISSIE	We will find them, I promise.

ISSIE	I can’t believe Blaze is from a herd of wild horses.

CALEB	Although, we’re not a hundred per cent on that.

DAN	I can’t believe the Kauri Point herd still exists.

ISSIE	We should tell Tom.

CAROLINE	Yeah, he’s still looking for Blaze’s owner.

NATASHA	You wanna be the one to tell him we took the horses beyond the swimhole?

DAN	Ah, no thanks.

CAROLINE	Hi.

CALEB	I hate when you do that, it’s so unsafe.

NATASHA	Yeah, stop showing off. If you fall off and hurt yourself, you’ll mess up the trial.

DAN	She’s right, we need you. We’ll never qualify for the champs without you.

CAROLINE	Nah, you’re sweet. So, what else can you do? Can you tell the future? Are we gonna win cross country trials?

ISSIE	No, I mean, it’s not like that. They’re more like, pictures and sounds, but they feel real, like one time, there was a boat and a bell.

DAN	My Nan reckons Issie saw a shipwreck from years ago.

ISSIE	Yeah, it was like I was there. Like, it was happening to me. It’s hard to explain, and I know it sounds weird, but, I think I’ve seen Mystic’s memories, or something.

NATASHA	So, you’re saying Mystic came from a shipwreck?

DAN	Two hundred years ago.

CAROLINE	Woah, that’s out there.

NATASHA	Why would he show you that?

ISSIE	I don’t know. You ok Caleb?

CALEB	Yeah, I just, there has to be an explanation, I just, can’t, find it.

CAROLINE	That’s cos it’s magic. Fact.

CALEB	Caroline. You.

NATASHA	Is he rebooting?

CAROLINE	Yeah, he’ll be ok in a minute. He’ll just go back to factory settings.

ISSIE	Hey guys, haven’t we just done a massive circle.

DAN	You’re right, we’re back where we started.

NATASHA	Oh, great. So, we’re lost.

CALEB	Anyone got a signal?

ISSIE	Haven’t had it since the swimhole.

NATASHA	Hey Dan. What time is your test?

DAN	Three.

NATASHA	In K.P?

DAN	Greenfield.

CAROLINE	Greenfield, that’s miles away.

NATASHA	And we don’t even know where we are.

ISSIE	Oh, no, this is rubbish, I’m really sorry.

DAN	It’s, it’s ok.

ISSIE	No, it’s not, you’re gonna miss your test, it’s all my fault.

DAN	Look, it doesn’t matter, it’s all good.

NATASHA	All good? What are you talking about?

CALEB	You have to get back.

DAN	No, I don’t.

NATASHA	What?

ISSIE	Of course you do.

DAN	Look, can you, I’m not doing it, ok? I already decided.

CAROLINE	What, when?

DAN	This morning, so just leave it.

NATASHA	But why?

DAN	Because I can’t, Caleb does tests, I do horses.

NATASHA	Oh, there’s more to you than that.

CALEB	Hello.

ISSIE	You’ve got to give it a go Dan.

DAN	What if I mess up?

ISSIE	Yeah, you’re right. Better to give up, really, I mean why try anything?

DAN	Why is this so important to all of you?

NATASHA	Because it’s important to you and we care, you idiot.

CAROLINE	Yeah.

DAN	I don’t know, it just seems like a waste of time.

ISSIE	Dan.

DAN	I just, I can’t.

Everybody starts to talk over ach other talking at Dan.

DAN	Ok. Ok.

NATASHA	Really?

DAN	Yeah, you win. Clearly this is the only way I can get out of this bush alive.

ISSIE	Great.

CALEB	That’s if we can get out of this bush alive.

CAROLINE	Don’t panic guys, I’ve got this.

CAROLINE	I’m just gonna get a bit higher.

CALEB	Um guys, can I just say that, for the record, there’s more to me than just, tests.

DAN	Ok.

CALEB	I mean, I do loads of other stuff…

DAN	Caroline be careful.

NATASHA	Woah, woah, woah, woah, don’t reach up there…

CAROLINE	I can see the swimhole. There.

CAROLINE	Chill out guys, oh, help, help, it’s so dangerous.

DAN	Stop it, ok, that’s danger…

CAROLINE	Ow.

CALEB	Caroline, are you alright?

CAROLINE	I’m ok, but, my shoulder.

DAN	Stay still, I’ll check if it’s broken.

CAROLINE	Ahh.

DAN	Can you guys sing, or dance, or something?

ISSIE	What?

DAN	Like, tell her a joke, distract her.

ISSIE	Oh, who’s this? Who’s this? Ready? Caroline Burford, that’s the most reckless riding, I’ve ever seen. It’s Tom.

NATASHA	That’s nothing, like Tom.

CAROLINE	What accent was that? Ow.

DAN	Ok, I don’t think it’s broken but it might be sprained.

CALEB	You are so lucky, that could have been so much worse.

DAN	You ok.

CAROLINE	Yeah, I should be fine.

DAN	There you go.

NATASHA	Nice one, Dr Dan. Maybe you’re not as useless as you think.

DAN	Maybe not.

CALEB	Guys, Dan is running out of time.

DAN	Ok, let’s go.

DAN	Tom is gonna kill me.

ISSIE	Dan, quickly, go.

CALEB	I’ll put Charlie away for you.

NATASHA	No, I’ll do it.

CALEB	Oh, kay.

DAN	Ok, I haven’t done the mucking out, or the horses, or anything.

DAN	Thank you, thank you.

ISSIE	Good luck.

CALEB	Good luck.

NATASHA	Tom’s gonna go crazy if he sees the stables like this.

CAROLINE	Remember, fake it till you make it. Bye.

DAN	Road closed. Why, what’s happened?

DAN	But, can you just let me go through, please, I’m running late.

DAN	Come on.

STELLA	Finally. Where have you all been? And what happened to your arm?

CAROLINE	Long story, did they win?

STELLA	Yep.

CAROLINE	Did Hamish score?

STELLA	Yep.

NATASHA	So, they won their group?

STELLA	Yep.

ISSIE	Hey, do you want to help with Dan’s chores?

STELLA	Nope.

CALEB	That was rhetorical.

STELLA	What?

ISSIE	Come on. Up you get.

NATASHA	Oh Stella, can you take this?

CAROLINE	Come on guys, quick, quick, quick.

ISSIE	Oi, for Aramis and Charlie.

CAROLINE	Come on Caleb, you’re so slow.

CALEB	Slow? You’re only using one arm…

ISSIE	Guys, I can hear Tom, he’s coming. Caroline, your sling.

ISSIE	Right, act normal, ok?

TOM	Whatever it is, I don’t wanna know.

DAN	Exam in progress, no, no, no, please, please.

TOM	You’re back early.

DAN	Yeah. I, um.

TOM	Why didn’t you turn up?

DAN	How did you know?

TOM	I’m your sponsor. They called me.

DAN	Sorry.

DAN	I didn’t make it in time.

ISSIE	What about your internship? You need to pass that test to apply.

DAN	Yeah.

TOM	He’s got one more chance.

DAN	I do?

NATASHA	Sweet.

TOM	No. Not sweet. It’s next Saturday.

CAROLINE	But that’s the Cross Country Trials.  We can’t enter without five riders.

TOM	No. You can’t.

NATASHA	So, Dan has to choose. That’s not fair.

TOM	Yeah, well, he should have thought about that.

DAN	I can’t let you guys down.

CALEB	You should take the test, bro.

STELLA	Yeah.

NATASHA	So, now we’ve got no chance of qualifying for the champs. Oh, Dulmoth Park are gonna love this.

CAROLINE	Or, Issie could do it?

ISSIE	What?

CAROLINE	You were great on Blaze today.

CALEB	That’s true.

ISSIE	No, no, no, no, no. I am not ready for this, you keep going on about how impossible the course is and what about that terrifying water jump?

CAROLINE	You’ve been riding round on a wild horse, I mean, you basically tamed her.

NATASHA	It’s not a bad idea. Look, they wouldn’t even count your score, they only take the top four.

STELLA	Yeah, we just need you to participate.

DAN	Yeah, and we can get you ready for it.

NATASHA	Come on Issie. You’ll do it, right?

ISSIE	Well, I guess I can try.

CAROLINE	Oh my gosh, welcome to the KP team.

TOM	Caroline. Any reason why Treacle’s still got his tack on?

CAROLINE	Oh, I forgot ‘cause we had to do Dan’s.

CAROLINE	I’ll do it now.

TOM	Good of you.

ISSIE	Caroline.

ISSIE	Hey. Are you ok?

CAROLINE	Yeah.

ISSIE	Are you gonna be able to ride like that? For the competition?

CAROLINE	Yeah, of course, I’m fine. Honestly.

ISSIE	Ok.
