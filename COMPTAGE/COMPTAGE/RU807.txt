RUPAUL	Previously on "Rupaul's Drag Race"…

DERRICK BARRY	If I want to do ratchet drag next week, can you give me any tips?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	If you want to do, like, memorable drag next week, I can give you some tips. 

ALL	(gasping)

DERRICK BARRY	Your intentions weren't to hurt?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No, they weren't to hurt.  If I wanted to hurt you, you'd be crying right now, bitch.

RUPAUL	You need to create original drag couture inspired by the wonderful "Wizard of Oz."

WOMAN	It's working?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah, it's done.

DERRICK BARRY	What?  Do something more to your outfit, because it doesn't look that great.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm ready for that chipotle.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	Robbie and Hedda Turner.

MICHELLE	Bustles can be flattering when they're on a big gown.  This looks like just a bunch of ruched up fabric stuck.

RUPAUL	Derrick and Tara Barry.

DERRICK BARRY	I did sew everything on here.

MICHELLE	It's a piece of fabric.

CHAZ	Everyone should take a look at Naomi right now.  This is how you win this competition.

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Who deserves to click their heels and go back to Kansas?

NAOMI SMALLS	Derrick.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Derrick.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick as well.

ACID BETTY	I think in this competition you have to apply every single second, and I'm here to win, so people like Chi Chi piss me off.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls, you are the winner of this week's challenge.  Derrick Barry, shantay, you stay.  Robbie Turner, sashay away.

NAOMI SMALLS	Oh, no more chicken wings.

DERRICK BARRY	That was an emotional one.  This has been such a rocky road for me.  I know there's at least three queens in the room that want to see me go home.  (sighs) Oh.

ACID BETTY	You broke down, girl, at the end.

NAOMI SMALLS	That monologue.

ACID BETTY	You were like, "Oh, my god, thank you for the Academy Award."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You don't understand how long it was.

DERRICK BARRY	This is the most emotional roller coaster I've ever been on.  It's such a struggle for me to be around such creative people.  And it just crumbled down on me today.  And I'm like, "I know the 'I'm a slave for you' dance."  (sobs) I'm so sorry.  (sniffles) May I leave the stage now?

THORGY THOR	Chi Chi, how are you feeling?  You got emotional on the runway today too.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's just hard when your hard work doesn't come across.  I feel like you guys don't look at me as if I'm trying hard enough, when it's not that.

THORGY THOR	Chi Chi will never recover from this bad decision.  I will never forget that she wasted our time yesterday.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I just feel misunderstood.

THORGY THOR	Clearly, Chi Chi is the next to go and Derrick's the next to go.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, man.

THORGY THOR	Either one of them, who cares?  They're the next to go. 

BACKUP SINGER	Rupaul Drag Race.

RUPAUL	The winner of "Rupaul's Drag Race" receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $,.  With extra special guest judges Thomas Roberts and Miss Vivica A. Fox.

BACKUP SINGER	Rupaul Drag Race.

SINGER	May the best woman.  Best woman win.

SINGER	Give your sister what she needs now.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yes!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Ooh!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	We're not in Kansas anymore.

THORGY THOR	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo, girl.

RUPAUL	She done already done had herses.  Hey, racers.

DERRICK BARRY	Hey, girl.

THORGY THOR	Hi.

RUPAUL	Good queens finish last, but shady queens rule the world, so if you ain't got nothing nice to say about somebody, take out an ad.

WOMAN	This was paid for by citizens against Lady Bunny.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yes!

THORGY THOR	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

ALL	Hi.

RUPAUL	Ladies, for a little morale boost, I've invited some company.

DERRICK BARRY	(gasps)

RUPAUL	Oh, Pit Crew.  Oh, look, they brought their bunk buddies…

DERRICK BARRY	Hi, guys.

ALL	Oh!

RUPAUL	And designer Andrew Christian.

THORGY THOR	Hi.

RUPAUL	Hello there.  Ladies, America's next drag superstar needs to use her intuition to make important decisions in the blink of a false eyelash.  Now, this is how we do it.  I share a fun fact about one of our Andrew Christian models, and then you determine if he prefers the top or the bottom…

DERRICK BARRY	(gasps)

RUPAUL	Bunk.  I'm talking bunk here, ladies.  There's a giant bunk bed right there, okay? 

RUPAUL	And the queen who gets the most matches wins.  First up, Derrick Barry.  "The Golden Girl" character Jason most identifies with is blanche Devereaux.

DERRICK BARRY	I would say bottom.

RUPAUL	All right.  Get on down there, Jason.

ANDREW	Peter prefers his coffee black.


RUPAUL	Oh.

DERRICK BARRY	I will put him on the top.

RUPAUL	Hips don't lie.  Corey's favorite music artist is Britney Spears.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh.  Bottom.

RUPAUL	That bottom is so crowded.  All right, Derrick, we will show you your results in a moment.  Kim Chi.  All right, now Jason number two.

JASON	Hello.

RUPAUL	Is that an Australian accent?

JASON	It is.

RUPAUL	Oh.  Are you from Perth?  You have Perth-onality?

JASON	No.	

RUPAUL	No. 

RUPAUL	All right, Jason's favorite exercise is chest press.

KIM CHI	I'm gonna go with top bunk for this one.

RUPAUL	Go on over.  Look at me, look at me.

ANDREW	Naomi, Murray's favorite movie is "Little Mermaid."

RUPAUL	Oh.

NAOMI SMALLS	Bottom bunk?

RUPAUL	I'll drink to that.  All right, Miles' spirit animal is Nicole Richie.

THORGY THOR	(laughs) I'm gonna say top bunk.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm gonna put Miles on the top bunk.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Bottom bunk.

RUPAUL	Okay. 

RUPAUL	Make room for Miles.  Welcome back, ladies.  Now let's debunk all the rumors.  Boys, show us your bunk preference, please.

RUPAUL	Ex-squeeze me?  Just one top in all of West Hollywood?

RUPAUL	My goodness.  All right, the winner of today's mini challenge is…Derrick Barry.

DERRICK BARRY	I won. 

RUPAUL	You've won a prize package from Casper Mattresses valued at $,.

DERRICK BARRY	Yes.

RUPAUL	And for our hungry viewers, we're posting photos of our bunk buddies at logotv.com.

NAOMI SMALLS	Bye!

RUPAUL	Ladies, now, this being an election year, I'm throwing your wigs into the ring as the first drag president of these United States of America. 

NAOMI SMALLS	All right.

RUPAUL	For this week's maxi challenge, you'll be working in pairs to create your own presidential campaign ads.  You need to both promote yourself and smear your opponent.  #shadypolitics.

THORGY THOR	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Now, I polled the judges to figure out who's your number one political adversary.  The first race is Thorgy Thor versus Chi Chi DeVayne.

THORGY THOR	Ooh.  (laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh, (bleep) this bitch just read me for filth on the runway.

RUPAUL	The next is Kim Chi versus Naomi Smalls.

KIM CHI	(laughs)

RUPAUL	And that leaves Derrick Barry versus Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(bleep).  It's (bleep) Derrick Barry.  He's so easily offended.  So now I have a challenge where I have to make jokes about Derrick.  I'm like, "Is he gonna flip out on me again?"

RUPAUL	Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the shadiest politician win.

THORGY THOR	All right, let's do it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(bleep).

THORGY THOR	So I get paired with Chi Chi because I called Chi Chi's ass out last week on the runway, but I'm happy to work with Chi Chi 'cause I will outshine her.  (laughs) My funny thing is that I'm actually a terrible tyrant.  I immediately was like, (trilling tongue) "Oh!  Oh!  Ooh, this is gonna be fun."  And I wrote  pages.  "Ads may be no longer than  seconds."  (bleep).  I have so much material.  I don't want to leave any of it out.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Damn, Thorgy.  Like, you just got too much going on.  You've got to edit, edit, edit.

THORGY THOR	This is going to be impossible.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

MICHELLE	Go for it, and give it all you got.

NAOMI SMALLS	America's drag president is signing up for…

MICHELLE	Cut.  You can play this one up.

KIM CHI	What a fat ass.

MICHELLE	More forcefully.

DERRICK BARRY	(growling)

MICHELLE	Okay.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I want to try to create you as, like, a supervillain, so I want shots of you in the video, like, like, doing this.  For today's challenge, we have to come up with a presidential campaign ad that promotes ourselves but at the same time smears the opponent.

DERRICK BARRY	Well, I'm obviously gonna call you ratchet.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I want to play up on this idea that you're not smart, and that I'm really smart.

DERRICK BARRY	We have butted heads before, so every team is gonna hope that Bob and I fail.  I'm down for that.  I want ours to be the best.  But we both want to win, and that's the kind of energy we need right now.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Why should Bob The Drag Queen be president?  Because I'm louder than everyone else.

THORGY THOR	Shh!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm the loudest one.

THORGY THOR	Shut up, Bob.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	Oh my god, Bob.  Shut the (bleep) up.

NAOMI SMALLS	Whenever Bob succeeds at anything, Thorgy always comes for him.  Thorgy really wants to beat Bob.  I think that's, like, kind of, like, her personal vendetta in this competition.  They're both from the same place, and I think Thorgy just really wants to be, like, the New York queen.  (laughs) It's gonna be weird having to do, like, insult each other when we're, like, friends.

KIM CHI	We're not gonna be like, "You're a bitch."  "No, you're a bitch.  You're ugly."  "Well, you're ugly too."


NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs) It's hard 'cause you're not a booger.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Kim Chi and Naomi are not gonna be smearing each other enough.  They are just acting like (bleep) Chia pets in the corner, and they're just so adorable.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm just gonna say, like, she was caught wearing flats onstage.  Like, stuff like that.

KIM CHI	I mean, work on it.

NAOMI SMALLS	I hate you.

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

ALL	Hello.

RUPAUL	My fellow femocrats, now, in a moment, you'll meet with your campaign advisers, Michelle Visage and Carson Kressley.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

KIM CHI	What, what.

RUPAUL	And tomorrow on the runway, the category is black-and-white movie realness.

ALL	Ooh.

RUPAUL	So good luck, and don't (bleep) it up.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Hey.

MICHELLE	Welcome, ladies.

DERRICK BARRY	It's our turn to go in and shoot with Michelle and Carson.  I need to redeem myself.  For me, this is go big r go home.

MICHELLE	Okay, whose campaign are we doing first?

DERRICK BARRY	Doing mine first.

MICHELLE	Derrick Barry for president.  Action.

DERRICK BARRY	Bob roams the streets of New York City stealing from defenseless people.

MICHELLE	Cut.

CARSON	Nancy Grace it out on that one, overly serious.

DERRICK BARRY	All right.

MICHELLE	And action.

DERRICK BARRY	Bob is only comfortable stealing from defenseless people on the mean streets of New York City.

MICHELLE	Cut.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick is doing this parody on, like, creepy republican white women, and it's really funny to me.

DERRICK BARRY	That was good?

MICHELLE	So much better.

DERRICK BARRY	Okay.

MICHELLE	Let's do the B-roll.  What's your first setup?

DERRICK BARRY	It is Bob in a hoodie, and he'll be stealing money from the Pit Crew.

MICHELLE	That's not stereotyping at all.

DERRICK BARRY	Not at all.

MICHELLE	I hope there's no skittles involved.

DERRICK BARRY	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No Arizona Tea either.

CARSON	(laughs)

MICHELLE	And action.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Cut.

DERRICK BARRY	Bob, creep in like this, just to get into the first one.

MICHELLE	And action.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Cut.  Print.  Done.  All right, Bob, your turn, baby.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	So can I get, like, the big couch over here?  I'm going for a little bit of Michelle Obama meets Hillary Clinton so, like, Blackie Onassis.

MICHELLE	Here we go.  Action.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I believe in strong drag family values.  Derrick Barry only had one baby, for breakfast. 

MICHELLE	(laughs)

CARSON	That was great.

MICHELLE	So now we have to do the Derrick stuff, right?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There's a scene in the end where she eats the baby.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, that's good.  That's, like, Norman Bates (bleep).

CARSON	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Okay, good.  Ready?  Action.

DERRICK BARRY	(laughs) Why?

CARSON & MICHELLE	(laugh)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick is going in.  (laughs)

MICHELLE	Go with it, go with it.

DERRICK BARRY	(growling)

MICHELLE	Great, cut.

CARSON	That was awesome.

MICHELLE	Good job.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm really shocked.  Derrick has never let go like this.

CARSON	Fabulous.

DERRICK BARRY	We did it.

NAOMI SMALLS	Hi.

KIM CHI	Hi.

MICHELLE	Who's going first?  Naomi.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yes.

MICHELLE	Okay.

NAOMI SMALLS	So my platform is being a supermodel, and I want the whole world to look beautiful.

MICHELLE	And action.

NAOMI SMALLS	America's drag president is signing up for speeches, debates, interviews…

MICHELLE	Cut.  Deliver it more.  Punch the words, you know?  Action.

NAOMI SMALLS	America's first drag president must speak as…(bleep).  Sorry.

MICHELLE	Cut.  It's all about attitude.  This is a shady political campaign.  I know you know how to be shady. 

NAOMI SMALLS	Have you been watching this season?

MICHELLE	(laughs)

KIM CHI	For my thing, I'm using food as a metaphor, and I'm smearing Naomi by how skinny she is, and we shouldn't trust her.  The biggest worry I have for this challenge is being able to speak clearly and the judges being able to understand my sense of humor.

MICHELLE	Here we go.  And action.

KIM CHI	She acts like she's the skinniest queen, but her waist isn't even  inches.

MICHELLE	More forcefully.  Remember to enunciate.

KIM CHI	All right.

MICHELLE	Action.

KIM CHI	She acts like she's the skinniest queen, but her waist isn't even  inches.

MICHELLE	Cut.  I think I'm seeing the words as they're coming out of your mouth, like, on paper.  Let that all go.  Let's move on.  Moving on.  Let's do the B-roll.  Action.

KIM CHI	What a fat ass.

MICHELLE	Cut.  The inflection should go down at the end.  Not, "What a fat ass?"  But, "What a fat ass."

KIM CHI	What a fat ass.

MICHELLE & CARSON	What a fat ass.

KIM CHI	What a fat ass.

MICHELLE	You went up again.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm nervous for Kim just because she did get a lot of notes, and she's not feeling confident, so I'm scared that my friend could go home.

CARSON	Good, move on.

MICHELLE	Okay.  Thorgy Thor and Chi Chi DeVayne.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Hi.

THORGY THOR	Hi.

CARSON	Hi.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I ain't gonna lie.  I'm a little nervous, but I just want to present in a professional way.

MICHELLE	All right, Chi Chi, you're up.  And action.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Thorgy Thor is always caught looking like she works for children's parties.  Do you really want Bozo running your country?  I think not.

MICHELLE	Cut.  Okay, you sounded like John Wayne, which is really weird.

THORGY THOR	(laughs)

MICHELLE	I say lose the deep voice.

CARSON	It's a little too literal and deadpan.  Like, it needs a little bit of flair.

MICHELLE	Yes.  You got that great Louisiana accent.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Okay.  I'm struggling with this because where I'm from, being country is not the thing to be.  I kind of want to seem presidential.  Damn.

MICHELLE	Thorgy Thor for president.  Go for it, and give it all you got.

THORGY THOR	I'm just gonna shorten it.

MICHELLE	Okay.

THORGY THOR	All right.

MICHELLE	And action.

THORGY THOR	My name is Thorgy Thor, and I need your vote to become the first drag queen president of the United States Of America.

CARSON	(laughs) 

MICHELLE	Good job.  Next scene.

THORGY THOR	Um…(quietly) "Freshmen year of college, threw up in the dorm."  (muttering indistinctly) She"…comforts.  That's a better word.

MICHELLE	Okay, let's hear it.

THORGY THOR	(laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Read, lady.

THORGY THOR	Sorry.  I just like to kid.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Here we go again.  Thorgy is changing ideas as she's going along.

THORGY THOR	What is this?  What is that?

MICHELLE	Ticktock, ticktock.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	She's just all over the place, and it's pissing me off.

THORGY THOR	It looks expensive.

MICHELLE	Focus, Thorgy.  Focus.

THORGY THOR	Sorry.

MICHELLE	And action.

THORGY THOR	Chi Chi's hand always goes straight for the bottle.

MICHELLE	Great, cut.  Perfect.

CARSON	That was excellent.

THORGY THOR	I think we got everything.

MICHELLE	No, B-roll now.

THORGY THOR	Oh, yeah.  (bleep), I forgot about all this.  All right, this is gonna be simple.  It's gonna be easy.

MICHELLE	Action.  What are they gonna do with canned food, by the way?  Do you want a shot of Chi Chi drinking booze?  'Cause you said her arm always reaches for the booze.

THORGY THOR	I think I'm good.

CARSON	You're done with Chi Chi?

THORGY THOR	Yeah, that's it.

MICHELLE	Okay.  Thank you, ladies.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

DERRICK BARRY	So, Kim Chi, did you grow up in North or South Korea?

KIM CHI	I grew up in…

KIM CHI	You can't leave North Korea.  It's not somewhere where you, like…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's not a vacation spot.

DERRICK BARRY	Wow.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Bring your ass up in here.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Walk into the club with this purse.  Bam. 

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm gonna do my makeup right away.

NAOMI SMALLS	It's time to get ready for today's runway: Black-and-white realness.  We are taking inspiration from what Detox did on her season.  Are you really doing all whiteface?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yes.  Someone to finally stand up for white people. 

THORGY THOR	Bob, you're quite a political person, if you will.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I like getting into politics.  It's actually fun.  My slogan is actually my real-life slogan.  Bob The Drag Queen, a queen for the people.  I live my life by that.  I was in Albany, in the capitol building, when marriage equality passed.  In , me and a couple of my friends decided to get together and do something about the inequalities we experience in the gay community, and we decided to do something called Drag Queen Weddings for Equality, and we would do these demonstrations in Times Square every single Saturday, until there was marriage equality in New York State, and I got arrested at Bryant Park for blocking traffic.  They (bleep) threw my ass in jail, in full drag, girl.  Like, you don't have to go get arrested but just something, something as simple as voting.  It is really important because politicians, they literally make very real and very, very important decisions for you.

NAOMI SMALLS	Like, you could've done maybe something about it before it happened.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, you can definitely do something about it.

DERRICK BARRY	So, Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	Yes, Derrick Barry?

DERRICK BARRY	Did you grow up in North or South Korea?

KIM CHI	I grew up in--(laughs) you can't leave North Korea.  It's not somewhere where you, like…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's not a vacation spot.

KIM CHI	And if you leave, like, your entire, like, family, your friends, like, all of them will be killed.  I was born here in America, and I went to elementary school in South Korea.

DERRICK BARRY	Would you go back to South Korea or no?

KIM CHI	Oh, definitely but there's no drag culture there.  There's hardly any gay culture.

DERRICK BARRY	Wow.

KIM CHI	One day I would love to be able to perform in South Korea and actually have people come out to see me.  I may be the first Korean drag queen to ever be featured on television.  Like, Americans have it so good here.  They don't even realize it, you know?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	So true.  So, so true. 

RUPAUL	(laughs)

SINGER	Cover girl, put the bass in your walk.  Head to toe, let your whole body talk.  And, what?

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "Rupaul's Drag Race."  My running mate, Michelle Visage.  How you doing?

MICHELLE	I may or may not be sitting on a hanging Chad. 

RUPAUL	Style superstar Carson Kressley.  Now, do you consider yourself bipartisan?

CARSON	I do, but the medication seems to be working.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Hot on the campaign trail, it's Thomas Roberts.

THOMAS	Hi, Ru.  I'm here to make America great again with you through Rupaul-itics.
	
RUPAUL	Let's make America great again.  And the secretary of sickening, Vivica A. Fox.

VIVICA	Strange, strange, strange.
RUPAUL	(laughs) I'm not wearing panties.

RUPAUL	This week we challenged our queens to create shady political ads.  And tonight, do not adjust your sets, because the category is black-and-white realness.  Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.

SINGER	The realness.

RUPAUL	First up, here's Bob The Drag Queen.

MICHELLE	Bob The Joker.

CARSON	Uh-oh.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I decided to do a look inspired the movie "Freaks", so I look creepy.  I look gorgeous.  I'm serving, girl.

RUPAUL	Harlequin romance novel.

THOMAS	Oh, and the sneer.  I like that.

RUPAUL	Up next, Derrick Barry.  Yes, a little black dress.  Oh.

VIVICA	Hey.

DERRICK BARRY	I'm representing old Hollywood, and this is a different look for me.  I feel like a movie star.

RUPAUL	Now, she's pumping some Yvonne De Carlo realness here.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

CARSON	Yes, she is.

RUPAUL	Lily Munster.  Naomi Smalls.

VIVICA	Baby?

MICHELLE	Oh, damn.

NAOMI SMALLS	Raven is such a huge inspiration.  I really just want to pay homage to how amazing she is.

RUPAUL	She has padded.

MICHELLE	Someone found a couch.

RUPAUL	Yeah.  What's your sleep number?

RUPAUL	Oh, oh, oh, oh.

THOMAS	Other way.

RUPAUL	This is Kim Chi, y'all.

VIVICA	She is just giving us drama.

KIM CHI	My idea is a sad-looking French Clown in a "Sin City" setting.

RUPAUL	Wrong way.

CARSON	I'll get her back.

RUPAUL	The mime has come to lip-synch for your life.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Okay.  Thorgy Thor.  Oh.

CARSON	She's got Bette Davis thighs.

VIVICA	It's hammer time.

THORGY THOR	I'm giving you Mae West meets Carrie Bradshaw.  My idea is to put them together in a hodgepodge to create my own Thorgy look.

RUPAUL	She looks a little ashy.

VIVICA	Yes.

RUPAUL	Lotion up, girl.  Lotion up.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne.

ALL	Ooh!

RUPAUL	She's gone Hollywood.

VIVICA	Sparkle, honey.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm wearing a gown that was passed down from my drag mom, so it's special, and my makeup is giving you "Dead president" realness, honey.

MICHELLE	She brought her Louisiana Roadkill with her too.

THOMAS	No Possums were harmed in the making of this outfit.

VIVICA	Yes.

SINGER	The realness.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

MICHELLE	We did have to work quite a bit with you.

CARSON	It was challenging.

MICHELLE	It was challenging.

NAOMI SMALLS	You okay, boo?

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Welcome, candidates.  First up, Bob The Drag Queen.  Let's take a look at your shady political ad.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(claps) Hi.  I'm Bob The Drag Queen, a queen for the people.  And as a public servant, I believe in serving the people.  That's why I want BJs for every single American.  That's right, better jobs for every American.  Buy yourself something pretty.  I believe in strong drag family values.  I adopted these three needy drag babies, and Derrick Barry only had one baby…for breakfast. 

DERRICK BARRY	(chomping)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Bob The Drag Queen has a plan--the gay agenda--and it's designed by lesbians, so you know it works.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Bob The Drag Queen for president.  Why?  Because I didn't eat a (bleep) baby.  This ad was paid for by my Uncle Steve.  He got money, girl. 

VIVICA	I loved that you threw so much shade that you made your opponent look like an absolute maniac.  You did an excellent job.  Strange.

CARSON	You have a very small amount of time to tell your story, to get the laugh.  I think it was tight, and it worked.

THOMAS	You demonstrated gravitas.

MICHELLE	I'm gonna throw a challenge at you.  I would love to see a fully-realized Glamasaurus Rex.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Okay.

RUPAUL	All right, next up, Derrick Barry.

DERRICK BARRY	Think Derrick Barry because this fairy thinks fairly.  As a Las Vegas local, I'm comfortable taking a gamble with your money.  However, Bob is only comfortable stealing from defenseless people on the mean streets of New York City.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(cackles)

DERRICK BARRY	I'm a very traditional woman.  However, Bob spends his time dropping acid with his friend Betty and engaging in orgies with his friend Thorgy.  I'm gonna spend my time incorporating drag  classes in schools across America.  However, Bob visits sick children in the hospital, and instead of making them laugh, he laughs at them.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughing)

DERRICK BARRY	Who is Bob, and what is he hiding?


BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(cackles)

MAN	This ad was paid for by Chad Michaels, all stars winner, celebrity female impersonator of the world. 

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That was good, Derrick.

DERRICK BARRY	Good job.

CARSON	You came across like you didn't really believe what you were saying, which is perfect for a politician.  I mean, you nailed it.  It was Michele Bachmann realness.

THOMAS	If you really were going for Michele Bachmann, though, you would've looked at the wrong camera.

VIVICA	Baby, the shade on your opponent, it was dead-on.

MICHELLE	You went in on your competition.  It was an actual, true smear.

CARSON	Runway look, a little underwhelmed.  Don't just give us that same old kind of pretty makeup.  Just show us something completely different.

RUPAUL	Up next, Naomi Smalls.

NAOMI SMALLS	Beauty is pain, and I believe America needs to toughen up.  A president needs to be able to carry herself.  How is Kim Chi gonna do that when she can't even walk in heels?

RUPAUL	(laughing)

NAOMI SMALLS	America's first drag president must give speeches, interviews, and debates.  It's gonna be hard to understand Kim Chi when you're dodging saliva through that strong lisp.

NAOMI SMALLS	When I'm elected, there will be no more parking tickets, and officers will be trained to give free injectable cosmetics.  Free Restylane for all!  I'm Naomi Smalls, and I promise to represent you fiercely.

MAN	This ad was paid for by citizens against non-lacefront wigs. 

RUPAUL	You made some campaign promises that really appeal to me.

VIVICA & NAOMI SMALLS	(laugh)

VIVICA	I loved that your commercial was really all about being a drag president, about being fabulous.

MICHELLE	Tonight on the runway, wow.  I mean, you look Ultra Glamorous.

CARSON	And then the hip with the padding.

RUPAUL	Yeah, the padding is phenomenal.

CARSON	I think it's my favorite look on the runway.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Up next, Kim Chi.  Let's take a look.

KIM CHI	Hi, I'm Kim Chi, and you want me as your first drag president.  Naomi Smalls says beauty is pain, but is she aware of the consequences of her actions?  America is a kitchen that needs a strong chef and never trust a skinny cook.  Small body, small mind.  She thinks she's the skinniest queen, but her waist is  inches.  What a fat ass.  Shady gays believe in no fats, no fems, and no Asians.  As someone who is all of the above, I understand your pain.  My name is Kim Chi, and say hello to yellow.  This ad was paid out of my own pocket because no one cares.  Do you?

VIVICA	When you came on, you didn't break.  You did the whole mime thing.  But the best part was your makeup.  bsolutely stunning.

CARSON	But your ad.  I don't think it really got the job done as far as what the challenge was, which was to be shady.

MICHELLE	We did have to work quite a bit with you and your inflections.

CARSON	It was challenging.

MICHELLE	It was challenging.  It's just--I don't think you're a big speaker.

KIM CHI	I do have, like, a bit of a fear of public speaking, so to be able to just enunciate clearly is something I've struggled with for a long time, and I tried my best and…

NAOMI SMALLS	Are you okay, boo?

KIM CHI	Yeah, I'm fine.

RUPAUL	I wouldn't be so hard on myself if I were you.  It's just that you've got some really tough competitors, and we're down to that place where we have to really give harsh critiques, you know?  Coming up…

VIVICA	I got totally confused on the smear campaign.  You could've drug her ass through the mud a whole lot more is all I'm gonna really tell you.

THORGY THOR	There were too many ideas.

VIVICA	Mm.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Next up, Thorgy Thor.

THORGY THOR	Hello.

RUPAUL	Let's take a look at your political shadiness.

THORGY THOR	Shoo.  Hello, good Americans.  My name is Thorgy Thor, and I need your vote to become the first drag queen president of the United States of America.  You need somebody you can trust.  I've never told a lie, and I'm not about to begin now.  This is my real hair.  My opponent Chi Chi DeVayne once drank too many wine coolers in college, and she threw up on the floor.  Now she visits recovering addicts and feeds food to the homeless.  I'm not buying it.  Chi chi's hand always goes straight for the bottle.  My top priority is health care.  That's why I'm sending a very expensive bottle of champagne to every home in America.  Cheers to your health and mine.  (laughs) Whoo!  Thorgy Thor for president, because I'm more powerful than you.

MICHELLE	Hmm.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	All right.

CARSON	Let's start with your runway look.  It's not the most glamorous look on the runway.  I think you look like a dead Boy George.

THOMAS	I was very entertained by your character.  I thought it was a little Joan Crawford, Faye Dunaway…

THORGY THOR	Thank you.

THOMAS	Over-the-top.

VIVICA	But I got totally confused when you were passing out the food, and then you didn't see anything about the booze, and I was kind of--I got a little lost on that.

CARSON	Michelle even asked you, "Don't you want to do, like, a boozy cutaway of Chi Chi?"  And we never saw that.  And in an ad of this length, you need to show us, not tell us, so that was a fail for me.

MICHELLE	There was, like, no smear in that smear campaign.  Also, there was no tagline, like, no paid-for line.

THORGY THOR	The difficult thing was to cut down exactly what material I wanted to come across with this character.  There were too many ideas.

RUPAUL	That's been a critique of you throughout the competition is learning how to edit.

THORGY THOR	You're right.  I could keep--I always just keep going, keep going, and going.  It is difficult to shut my thought processes down.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Thorgy.  Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Okay.  I'm Chi Chi DeVayne, and I approve this message, girl.  I'm Chi Chi DeVayne, and I should be your next drag president because I'm real, chill, and my makeup don't peel.  But my opponent Thorgy Thor is always caught looking like she works for children's parties.  Do you really want a clown running your country?  I think not.  Meanwhile, I'm working to ensure that every American has a pot to piss in and a window to throw it out.  And in that same pot, there'll be chitlins boiling for all.  Thorgy want America to walk around with horrible hip pads that resemble Peggy Bundy.  Who wants to walk around with a FUPA?  America says, "Not me, Thorgy Thor."

MAN	This message has been paid for by citizens who like to eat rare and unusual animal parts.

VIVICA	Oh! 


VIVICA	Well.  I really love this sassy character.  However, your smear campaign, you could've drug her ass through the mud a whole lot more is all I'm gonna really tell you.

MICHELLE	The look was a bit shocking to me.  You're a drag queen president.  I didn't feel like there was any "zjooshing" up.

CARSON	You were, like, rocking the Wanda Sykes as assistant in "Monster-In-Law" look.  I wasn't a fan.  I do think there really wasn't any smear in there, and I think for both of you, you were too nice to each other.  Just remember what the challenge is.

MICHELLE	You came in in kind of a character, and I think we just had to push you a little bit for you to be in your skin.

CARSON	And that's the key for you, is to just own that bayou charm.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(sighs) Where I come from, it's damn hard to get out of the ghetto, to get out of that, and I think that's why I kind of--I don't want to be ghetto.  You know what I mean?  Because I feel like…

RUPAUL	Let me just tell you this.  Let me stop you here.  Just be you.  Honey, that's why we sent you a plane ticket.  You know, we don't need you to be somebody else.

MICHELLE	I do want to say that this my sixth season doing this, and I have not seen such a strong set of girls before.  There is not one of you that was terrible at all.  This is what we're up against as judges.

RUPAUL	Thank you, ladies.  While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.  Just between us swing voters, what do you think?  Bob The Drag Queen.

VIVICA	Bob nailed it.

CARSON	She's great at the comedy.  She was great at the writing.  She was great at the acting.

THOMAS	Bob had gravitas in that campaign.

RUPAUL	You are in love with that word.

THOMAS	Yeah.

CARSON	I still don't even know what it means.

RUPAUL	I know, I want to--tell me.

THOMAS	It means "heft."

RUPAUL	Like a fat ass kind of heft?

MICHELLE	Gravit-ass.

RUPAUL & THOMAS	(laugh)

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	When she was Derrick Bachmann, I think she smeared Bob, and she smeared him well.  She had a really good, campy, fun time with him.

RUPAUL	Those two have a history of being rivals, and they made it work for them.  This is like what I do every week with Michelle Visage.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls.

MICHELLE	She was the only one that threw actual shade.

CARSON	And she's so likeable.

VIVICA	Now, that runway, she was padded for Jesus.  Gorgeous.

RUPAUL	Naomi has risen to the occasion, and that's the progress we love in this competition.  Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	Her shade part with Naomi was "Eh."

VIVICA	I didn't know whether or not she was doing a campaign ad or if she was doing a food ad.

RUPAUL	But this kid is so imaginative, and then she brought up the no fats, no fems, no Asians thing, which was very political, the fact that gay people are fighting for fairness.  But, you know, on Craigslist, you're free to be as racist and body shaming as possible.

VIVICA	Really?

RUPAUL	Yeah.

CARSON	I'm gonna take that off my profile.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

MICHELLE	This runway tonight was a swing and a miss.  I know she's wacky and different, but it should be cohesive.

CARSON	The political campaign, love the commitment to the character but it was kind of too much about her.

VIVICA	She didn't do any of the smear campaign at all, and when she did, it was like, "Oh, enough about you but back to me."

RUPAUL	Lots of ideas, but you've got to land a punch.  Chi Chi DeVayne.

MICHELLE	Tonight on the runway, that is the best she's looked this entire competition.

THOMAS	Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the political campaign.  That wasn't somebody that could be the first drag ueen president.

MICHELLE	When Chi Chi walked out to meet Carson and I, I literally though it was James Brown coming out.

RUPAUL	Silence.

VIVICA	Mm.

RUPAUL	I've made my decision.  Bring back my girls, Mr. Gorbachev!  (laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Welcome back, ladies.  I've made some decisions.  Bob The Drag Queen and Derrick Barry, condragulations, you are both the winners of this week's challenge.

DERRICK BARRY	(screams)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Congrats, baby.

RUPAUL	You've each won an original couture gown from Mountbatten Concepts.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, wow.  I'm on cloud nine.  This is the moment I've been waiting for.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Pleasure meeting all of you.  Thank you.

DERRICK BARRY	Thank you, all of you.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm glad that we won together.  Working with Derrick, I've learned to like and respect him.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls and Kim Chi, you are safe.

KIM CHI	(sighs)

RUPAUL	You may join the other girls.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you so much.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor, Chi Chi DeVayne, I'm sorry, my dears, but you are up for elimination.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I do not deserve to be in the bottom.  I ain't going home.

RUPAUL	Two queens stand before me.  Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination.  The time has come for you to lip-synch for your life!

THORGY THOR	I am a performer through and through.  One of us has to go home.  She is.

RUPAUL	Good luck, and don't (bleep) it up.

SINGER	And I am telling you I'm not going.  You're the best man I'll ever know.  There's no way I can ever go.  No, no, there's no way.  No, no, no, no way.  I'm living without you.  I'm not living without you.  I don't wanna be free.  And you, and you.  You're gonna love me.  And time and time, we've had so much to see and.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Tear down the mountains.  Yell, scream, and shout like you can say what you want.  I'm not walking out.  Stop all the rivers, push, strike, and kill.  I'm not gonna leave you.  There's no way I will.  And I am telling you.

SINGER	I'm not going.  You're the best man I'll ever know.  There's no way I could ever, ever go.  No, no, no, no way.  You're gonna love me.

THOMAS	Wow. 

RUPAUL	Ladies, I've made my decision.  Chi Chi DeVayne, shantay, you stay.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Thank you.  I love you, baby.

THORGY THOR	I love you always.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor, you brought the BK to the RDR.  And, girl, I ain't gonna L-I-E.

THORGY THOR	(laughs)

RUPAUL	We loved every minute of it.  Now sashay away.

THORGY THOR	Thank you, Ru, so much.

THORGY THOR	I love you guys.

DERRICK BARRY	Bye, Thorgy.

THORGY THOR	Bye, guys.  Witty catchphrase, you know what I mean?

THORGY THOR	Ru, I think you made a little bit of a mistake, but you have your reasons for things.  This show is a lot harder than you think, so judge us kindly.  I don't regret a single thing.  I will look at this as a catalyst towards more greatness.  I love you, Ru.

RUPAUL	Condragulations, ladies.  Now, remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you and you and you gonna love somebody else?  Can I get an amen in here?

ALL	Amen.

RUPAUL	All right.  Now let the music play.

SINGER	Die tomorrow, live tonight.  Die tomorrow, live tonight.  Die tomorrow, live tonight.
