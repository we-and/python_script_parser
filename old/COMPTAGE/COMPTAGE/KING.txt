BIANCA	Jacob, it's Bianca.

BIANCA	I'm in trouble.

BIANCA	I need your help, please.

BIANCA	I took something they want.

BIANCA	Jacob, I don't know what to do.

BIANCA	Please, call me.

FEMALE	How long will you be staying here in Los Angeles, Mr. King?

JACOB	One week.

JACOB	My return flight to Cape Town's on the 5th.

JACOB	It's there on the ticket, ma'am.

FEMALE	You still haven't given us an address.

FEMALE	Where are you going to be staying?

JACOB	I'm not sure.

MALE OFFICER	Do you have any friends here, or any family?

JACOB	I have to find a hotel.

FEMALE OFFICER	With $600 in cash

FEMALE OFFICER	for seven days? And no credit card?

JACOB	I'll make it last.

MALE OFFICER	That's your idea of a vacation, Mr. King?

JACOB	Took me three months to save that,

JACOB	and the ticket.

JACOB	I don't make much.

FEMALE OFFICER	You drive a cab in Cape Town?

JACOB	That's right.

MALE OFFICER	But you can make more driving a cab in Los Angeles,

MALE OFFICER	right, Mr. King?

JACOB	I'm sorry, I don't understand.

MALE OFFICER	Working, staying here in Los Angeles.

JACOB	I have no intentions of working,

JACOB	or staying,

JACOB	and that's the truth.

JACOB	Do you have a room?

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	Sixty-five a night, cash up front.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	I need to see an ID.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	My first name's George. My rules, or you're out.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	No hookers, queers, puntas, parties, junk weed,

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	crack, meth, or loud music.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	Not that you seem the type, Mr. King.

JACOB	ianca...

JACOB	Bianca...

TRISH	Hello?

TRISH	Can I help you?

JACOB	I hope so.

JACOB	I'm looking for someone.

JACOB	I think I have the right address, but, uh...

TRISH	Who are you looking for?

JACOB	My sister, Bianca Zagosin. Do you know her?

TRISH	And you are?

JACOB	Her brother, Jacob.

TRISH	Yeah, I remember you.

TRISH	I've seen you in photos. I'm Trish.

JACOB	Trish.

TRISH	You're a lot cuter in person. Come on in.

TRISH	So you just get in?

JACOB	Yeah.

JACOB	My sister, she lives next door, nay?

TRISH	Used to.

TRISH	You know, I haven't talked to Bianca in, like, forever.

TRISH	It was actually right around my birthday.

TRISH	I don't know, to me, she seemed fine,

TRISH	it's just all of the sudden she just bugged out.

TRISH	She just left,

TRISH	didn't say goodbye, didn't say anything,
TRISH	didn't even leave a forwarding address,

TRISH	'cause I asked the landlords.

JACOB	So they both moved out?

TRISH	Yeah. Her and Armand did.

JACOB	You mean Alex? Her husband?

TRISH	No, her and Armand.

TRISH	I mean, Alex hasn't been around in forever.

JACOB	Who's Armand?

TRISH	Their boy.

JACOB	Boy?

JACOB	Bianca has a child?

TRISH	It's not hers. It's Alex's kid.

TRISH	How do you not know this?

TRISH	You guys don't talk much?

JACOB	No, no, but she tried calling,

JACOB	and now her phone is disconnected.

TRISH	Oh, so you're just worried?

JACOB	She's my little sister.

TRISH	That's sweet.

JACOB	So where did Alex go?

TRISH	They had a big argument.

TRISH	I mean, she didn't tell me what about.

JACOB	And he just left her,

JACOB	with his kid?

TRISH	Yeah.

TRISH	You want to sit down?

TRISH	You don't like Alex?

JACOB	I only met him once. In Cape Town.

TRISH	I think Alex got into some sort of money trouble.

TRISH	It was a mess.

TRISH	Hey! This is Jacob, Bianca's brother.

BILL	Cool.

TRISH	How'd the audition go?

BILL	You've got to be kidding me. No more fucking ice.

TRISH	Can you please not make a show right now?

BILL	You know what? Can you not do this shit?

TRISH	Well, he's looking for Bianca. Give me one second.

TRISH	You know what? She left some stuff here.

TRISH	Let me grab that for you.

BILL	What did she leave here?

TRISH	It's just a bag of her stuff, Bill.

BILL	How could you let him in?

TRISH	Sorry about that.

JACOB	It's all right.

TRISH	Hey look, we are having people over tonight.

TRISH	I mean, you're more than welcome to come if you want.

TRISH	I told everyone 8:30,

TRISH	but stuff doesn't get really hopping until, like,

TRISH	10:30, so you should come by.

JACOB	Okay.

TRISH	Great. See you later.

JACOB	Do you happen to know who Bianca paid her rent to?

TRISH	Oh yeah, Mrs. Lazlo.

TRISH	If you go around the street, there's a white building.

TRISH	Go to the back.

JACOB	Thank you.

MRS. LAZLO	Excuse me for saying this,

MRS. LAZLO	but your sister's husband was a cheap son of a bitch.

MRS. LAZLO	Wasn't one month I got the rent on time.

MRS. LAZLO	It was always a fight.

MRS. LAZLO	Good thing they moved her out when they did,

MRS. LAZLO	because I was about to throw her out.

JACOB	Who moved her out?

MRS. LAZLO	Oh, some pal of her old man's, Zeek.

MRS. LAZLO	That's right, Zico.

MRS. LAZLO	Slicked back hair, you know, asshole, Mediterranean,

MRS. LAZLO	didn't expect the check to clear.

JACOB	So Bianca owes you money?

MRS. LAZLO	No, he squared up on everything.

MRS. LAZLO	God knows how she pulled that off.

MRS. LAZLO	He didn't even complain about losing the deposit.

MRS. LAZLO	Guess he knew what a mess she was.

JACOB	Did you see her before she went?

MRS. LAZLO	When she moved in here, she was a nice young woman.

MRS. LAZLO	Polite. Pretty, too.

MRS. LAZLO	Last time I saw her, sonny, she looked terrible,

MRS. LAZLO	beat up and strung out.

MRS. LAZLO	I'm sorry, but that's how it was.

JACOB	This friend, Zico, I don't know him.

JACOB	Do you know where I can find him?

MRS. LAZLO	The name on the check was [indistinct] Carwash

MRS. LAZLO	It’s up on Prospect Street.

MRS. LAZLO	Maybe he works there.

MEN	(Laughter)

JACOB	Excuse me,

JACOB	I'm looking for Zico.

MAN 1	There's nobody here called Zico.

JACOB	Mm-hmm.

MAN 2	What's this about, my friend?

JACOB	I'm looking for my sister, Bianca.

JACOB	Bianca Zagosin.

JACOB	Zico knows her.

JACOB	He might be able to help me find her.

MAN 2	Sorry, no.

MAN 1	There's nobody here called Zico.

MAN 2	We can't help you.

JACOB	Excuse me. Is this the [indistinct] Mart?

WOMAN	(Speaks in Korean)

JACOB	Excuse me.

JACOB	Can I ask you a question?

SALESWOMAN	What you buying?

JACOB	I'm not buying anything, ma'am.

JACOB	I just want to know if you've seen this woman.

SALESWOMAN	No, I don't know.

JACOB	This woman—

SALESWOMAN	I don't know. I don't know.

JACOB	Does she shop here? 

SALESWOMAN	I'm busy. I'm working.

SALESWOMAN	Sorry. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

MAN	Mom, what's the problem?

SALESWOMAN	(speaks in Korean)

MAN	What's going on, man?

JACOB	I only want to know if you've seen this woman

JACOB	and perhaps the kid.

BOTH	(speaking in Korean)

MAN	You're not from around here, are you?

JACOB	No, South Africa.

BOTH	(speaking in Korean)

MAN	I don't remember her,

MAN	but I've seen this kid in here for sure.

JACOB	When was the last time?

MAN	Maybe two, three weeks ago.

MAN	Who are they?

JACOB	My sister and her boy. I'm looking for them.

JACOB	They've disappeared.

BOTH	(Speaks in Korean)

JACOB	What did she say?

MAN	She's asking if you've checked the morgue.

MORGUE OFFICER	All right, this is case number 4372.

MORGUE OFFICER	Female, African American,

MORGUE OFFICER	found in a dumpster up on Manchester.

MORGUE OFFICER	Cause of death,

MORGUE OFFICER	OD from prescribed psychiatric medication.

MORGUE OFFICER	Seems the dumpster was her home.

JACOB	Not her.

MORGUE OFFICER	All right.

MORGUE OFFICER	Back up. Back up.

MORGUE OFFICER	Nah. It's the wrong demographic.

MORGUE OFFICER	Mid-50s, found in a bathtub,

MORGUE OFFICER	trying to pretend she was a fish.

MORGUE OFFICER	All right, number 4410 right here.

MORGUE OFFICER	Yeah, I remember you, baby.

MORGUE OFFICER	Found in a stolen vehicle upon West Olympic.

MORGUE OFFICER	Cause of death, blunt force trauma to the head.

MORGUE OFFICER	Made the Channel Four news.

MORGUE OFFICER	You know, we had one just like this

MORGUE OFFICER	a couple years back.

MORGUE OFFICER	Gang shit.

MORGUE OFFICER	Man, them motherfucking gangs these days.

MORGUE OFFICER	Come on, brother, tell me this ain't her.

JACOB	It's not her.

MORGUE OFFICER	Jah be praised.

MORGUE OFFICER	Or are you all up in Allah and shit?

MORGUE OFFICER	I've got to say something here.

MORGUE OFFICER	You exotic Negros is some cold-blooded mother fuckers, man.

MORGUE OFFICER	Most people be in the john by now, trying to call Earl.

JACOB	(shouts)

JACOB	(crying)

MAN	Whoa, whoa, wrong room.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	The only room with the porno working,

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	so I've got to keep it free.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	Here you go.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	You're in 210 now.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST	Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. King.
ZICO	What the-- what the fuck do you want, man?

ZICO	You fucking with the wrong guy.

ZICO	(grunting)

JACOB	You killed my sister. Who told you to?

JACOB	Why? Why?

ZICO	They told us to.

JACOB	Who told you?

ZICO	Give me back my fucking phone.

ZICO	(grunting and coughing)

ZICO	No, no!

JACOB	Whoever you work for,

JACOB	tell them this was a message from the King.

BILL	Trish, open up the fucking door.

BILL	I know you're in there. Open the fucking door.

BILL	Open the fucking door. I swear to God,

BILL	I'm going to break this fucking door down, Trish.

JACOB	Where is your girlfriend?

BILL	Listen, man, we've had enough trouble

BILL	with your sister already.

BILL	So I'd really appreciate it if you'll leave Trish alone.

BILL	(Shouting)

BILL	What the hell were you doing in there?

TRISH	Bill, stop.

BILL	Why do you always have to get so fucked up?

TRISH	Stop. 

BILL	Come here. Come the fuck on.

WOMAN	You must be Jacob.

WOMAN	Bianca's brother, right?

WOMAN	So how long are you in town for?

TRISH	I'm glad you made it.

TRISH	What's wrong? You look a little tense.

TRISH	Are you okay? (Laughing)

JACOB	We need to talk. 

TRISH	Okay, let's talk.

JACOB	Did you do this with Bianca?

TRISH	Mm-hmm.

JACOB	You do other things with her?

JACOB	Is that why he hates her?

JACOB	Your boyfriend?

TRISH	I liked her.

TRISH	She liked me.

TRISH	Mmm... And I like you.

JACOB	Did Bianca do a lot of blow?

TRISH	Mm-hmm.

JACOB	Did she score it for you?

TRISH	(sigh) Mm-hmm.

TRISH	She turned me on to Zico's boy, Frankie.

TRISH	Deals on wheels.

JACOB	Who is Zico?

TRISH	Hmm? 

JACOB	How do you know him?

TRISH	He's one of Alex's boys.

BILL	What are you doing?

TRISH	(laughing)

BILL	What the fuck? 

TRISH	I'm sorry.

BILL	What the fuck?

TRISH	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No no, come here.

TRISH	Look at me. Look at me. Look. Nothing happened.

TRISH	Nothing happened.

TRISH	Nothing happened.

TRISH	Come here.

JACOB	How about for an eight ball?

FRANKIE	Sorry?

JACOB	You heard me.

FRANKIE	I don't know what you're talking about, mate.

FRANKIE	Does he think I'm dealing or something?

JACOB	That's what I've been told.

FRANKIE	Patricia, who is this guy?

TRISH	It's Bianca's brother.

FRANKIE	Really? 

TRISH	Hmm.

FRANKIE	It's good to meet you, mate. Welcome.

FRANKIE	So what brings you to this neck of the woods then?

JACOB	I'm looking for Bianca.

FRANKIE	Right, yeah I haven't seen her for a while, I'm afraid.

FRANKIE	It's like everyone in this fucking place though, you know.

FRANKIE	They're here one minute, gone the next.

FRANKIE	Fucking nomadic culture, you know?

JACOB	Yeah.

JACOB	But I have to wonder why she'd lose touch with her dealer,

JACOB	with her drug problem and all that.

FRANKIE	Keep your fucking voice down, mate.

FRANKIE	And I'm not a dealer, okay?

FRANKIE	I deal in pleasure and I deliver it

FRANKIE	to a very select fucking few, you know?

JACOB	You get to cussing when you get nervous,

JACOB	did you know that? 

FRANKIE	'Course I'm fucking nervous,

FRANKIE	you're going around shouting that I'm some shithead dealer.

JACOB	It's a reasonable question.

JACOB	You are her dealer.

JACOB	You probably know where she is.

JACOB	Do you?

FRANKIE	You're off. 

TRISH	What?

FRANKIE	You're off the fucking list. Jesus Christ.

TRISH	What the fuck is your problem?

TRISH	I mean, who even talks to someone like that?

FRANKIE	Yes, he's here.

FRANKIE	Of course I'm fucking sure. I was talking to him, mate.

FRANKIE	Hey, what are you doing, mate? What the--

FRANKIE	(grunting)

JACOB	You didn't answer my question. Why did they kill Bianca?

JACOB	Why?

FRANKIE	I don't... (stammering)

JACOB	Tell me.

FRANKIE	She had something they wanted.

FRANKIE	I don't know what the fuck it was though, mate,

FRANKIE	I promise. I swear--

JACOB	Pissed who off? Pissed who off?

FRANKIE	The guys Zico works for.

JACOB	Who does he work for?

FRANKIE	All right. It's the... the... Duke.

FRANKIE	He’s called the fucking Duke, I swear.

MAN SHOUTING	Get inside.

JACOB	Go tell Duke.

FRANKIE	That's not mine. He's going to fucking kill me.

KELLY	I saw you out there.

KELLY	About... earlier... you know, the guy at the motel?

KELLY	I wanted to say thank you.

JACOB	For what?

KELLY	For not—um...

KELLY	I don't fuck them.

JACOB	You have to keep a roof over your head. Nay?

KELLY	(sighs)

KELLY	Let me see that. Wow, she's pretty.

KELLY	Who is she?

KELLY	So what are you doing in this shitty ass place?

JACOB	You mean here? Or Los Angeles?

KELLY	Both.

KELLY	Is it about her?

KELLY	You looking for her?

KELLY	Everybody's looking for something in this place.

KELLY	You come here looking for the one thing in the world

KELLY	that you think is gonna make you happy.

KELLY	And then after a few years,

KELLY	all you want to do is get the hell out.

KELLY	Have you ever seen this place in the rain?

KELLY	It's like rotting cardboard, same smell.

KELLY	But then the rain clears and the sun shines

KELLY	and the air smells like jasmine and orange,

KELLY	and you think that maybe,

KELLY	maybe it's not so bad,

KELLY	maybe you're gonna stay

KELLY	and give it another go.

KELLY	And then what you think was a pile of trash gets up

KELLY	and starts pushing a cart full of cans.

KELLY	Sleeping under a bridge.

JACOB	That little girl with you at the motel,

JACOB	is she your daughter?

KELLY	Yeah.

JACOB	How old is she?

KELLY	She's eight.

JACOB	Give this to her.

JACOB	I think maybe she will like it

JACOB	because it has the elephant on it.

KELLY	She loves elephants.

KELLY	Thank you.

KELLY	I'm Kelly, by the way.

JACOB	Jacob.

KELLY	Jacob.

KELLY	It was nice talking to you.

KELLY	Hey. 

JACOB	Hello.

JACOB	Um, can you hold onto this for me? I have to go out.

JACOB	I don't want to leave it in the room.

KELLY	Okay.

JACOB	(indistinct) I have a favor to ask.

JACOB	You've got a car, nay?

JACOB	Can I use it?

JACOB	Only for a few hours.

JACOB	I can pay you.

KELLY	Hell, that's more money than it's worth.

KELLY	Hang on.

KELLY	The fucked up Camry downstairs, New Mexico plates,

KELLY	can't miss it.

JACOB	Thank you.

KELLY	You want to come in?

KELLY	This is Boot.

JACOB	No, no, it's all right. I have to go. Chop chop.

KELLY	Okay.

TRISH	Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me?

TRISH	Get out of here. Get away.

JACOB	Did Bianca leave anything else with you?

TRISH	Dude, back the fuck off my space.

JACOB	She had something they wanted.

TRISH	Look, I don't give a shit about

TRISH	your fucking problems, all right?

JACOB	Tell me. 

TRISH	No, get out of here.

JACOB	Tell me everything that happened with Alex.

JACOB	Tell me the truth.

JACOB	The truth. (grunts)

TRISH	They argued all the time, okay?

TRISH	I heard them.

TRISH	They argued all the time, and one day, Alex was just gone.

JACOB	Where?

TRISH	I don't fucking know.

TRISH	She said they had a big fight.

TRISH	All his shit was still there.

TRISH	I mean, I don't fucking know, man.

TRISH	He just left, all right?

TRISH	She wasn't even fucking mad. She was just... scared.

JACOB	What happened after that?

TRISH	She came to me one day and gave me a fucking bag

TRISH	with all her shit in it, and told me not to tell Zico.

TRISH	I don’t’—I mean, I don't know, man.

TRISH	She was just fucking freaked out about something.

TRISH	I don't know. What do you want me to tell you?

JACOB	Was Bianca getting her teeth fixed?

TRISH	What?

JACOB	Her teeth, was she getting her teeth fixed?

TRISH	(scoffs) Bianca wasn't getting shit fucking fixed.

TRISH	Fucking crazy, man.

JACOB	I found Bianca at the morgue.

JACOB	She'd been tortured.

JACOB	They cut off her foot.

JACOB	They blinded her.

TRISH	Don't tell me that shit!

TRISH	Don't fucking come over to my house and tell me that shit!

TRISH	You don't think I cared for her?

TRISH	I was the only person that cared for her.

TRISH	Where the fuck were you?

DUKE	This is Duke.

DUKE	Hello?

JACOB	Mr. Lawenda, I called. I have a 11:30 appointment.

LADY	Of course.

LADY	You haven't seen Dr. Wentworth before, have you, Mr. Lawenda?

JACOB	No, but I have seen his work.

LADY	If you could take a seat and fill this out,

LADY	Dr. Wentworth will be with you in just a moment.

JACOB	Very good.

LADY	Mr. Lawenda.

LADY	Mr. Lawenda, Dr. Wentworth's ready for you.
DR. WENTWORTH	Mr. Lawenda.

DR. WENTWORTH	A man after my own heart: You don't like filling in forms.

DR. WENTWORTH	Not a problem, I'll get everything as we go along.

DR. WENTWORTH	So the notes say you've been having some pain.

DR. WENTWORTH	Let's take a look at those top molars, shall we?

DR. WENTWORTH	Open wide.

DR. WENTWORTH	Hmm. Nothing immediately apparent.

DR. WENTWORTH	I should get some X-rays, I think.

DR. WENTWORTH	It says your sister referred you.

DR. WENTWORTH	I don't think I remember her. 

JACOB	Bianca.

DR. WENTWORTH	Bianca, of course.

JACOB	Bianca left me your name.

JACOB	She also left me something else.

JACOB	I'm looking after it for her.

JACOB	It's something I think you want.

DR. WENTWORTH	I can't imagine what that would be.

DR. WENTWORTH	I'm afraid there wasn't much Bianca had

DR. WENTWORTH	that anyone in their right mind would want.

DR. WENTWORTH	Apart from her looks, of course.

JACOB	And her teeth.

JACOB	They must be beautiful now,

JACOB	with all the work she had done on them.

DR. WENTWORTH	I wasn't expecting to be paid,

DR. WENTWORTH	if that's what you're suggesting.

JACOB	This isn't about money.

DR. WENTWORTH	It nearly always is.

DR. WENTWORTH	You know, part of me's been wondering

DR. WENTWORTH	if someone would come looking for her.

DR. WENTWORTH	Hoping, in fact.

DR. WENTWORTH	I hated the idea that she was just another Los Angeles orphan

DR. WENTWORTH	who might sink without trace.

DR. WENTWORTH	I always meant to ask her if she had any family.

DR. WENTWORTH	Well, you're my last appointment of the morning.

DR. WENTWORTH	Can I buy you some lunch?

DR. WENTWORTH	The average middle class American

DR. WENTWORTH	spends almost a thousand bucks

DR. WENTWORTH	on each of those teeth in their lifetime.

DR. WENTWORTH	You multiply that four or five times in a place like this.

DR. WENTWORTH	See, my point is I have a very good reputation,

DR. WENTWORTH	I have a very good practice,

DR. WENTWORTH	and all in all, a very good life.

DR. WENTWORTH	There would be very little sense in me jeopardizing that.

DR. WENTWORTH	Let me tell you something.

DR. WENTWORTH	Dentists are for men,

DR. WENTWORTH	what gynecologists are for women.

DR. WENTWORTH	Once you have them wide open and your hand is inside them,

DR. WENTWORTH	their sense of shame just drops away.

DR. WENTWORTH	You become trusted with their confidences.

DR. WENTWORTH	Sometimes, you send them home with a prescription

DR. WENTWORTH	that's a little more fun than what the problem requires,

DR. WENTWORTH	and other times, well,

DR. WENTWORTH	if you can help out a little more substantively

DR. WENTWORTH	and nobody's going to get hurt, then why not help out?

JACOB	What if somebody did get hurt?

DR. WENTWORTH	Bianca?

DR. WENTWORTH	Why would you say that?

DR. WENTWORTH	She could be anywhere right now.

DR. WENTWORTH	She could be sitting in the Starbucks around the corner,

DR. WENTWORTH	for all we know.

DR. WENTWORTH	She was always disappearing and she always turns up again.

DR. WENTWORTH	You know Bianca.

JACOB	I used to think so.

JACOB	I'm not sure if I do anymore.

JACOB	Where did you meet?

DR. WENTWORTH	At a party.

DR. WENTWORTH	She had a lot going for her.

DR. WENTWORTH	I know people. She wanted me to make some introductions,

DR. WENTWORTH	and so I did. I helped her out.

JACOB	Did you sleep with her?

DR. WENTWORTH	No, as a matter of fact, I didn't. I'm married.

JACOB	So was she.

DR. WENTWORTH	Look, I'm not apologizing for it.

DR. WENTWORTH	She needed the money.

DR. WENTWORTH	She never did anything she didn't want to do.

JACOB	Why did some man move out all her things

JACOB	and pay all her debt?

DR. WENTWORTH	I'm the wrong one to ask, I'm afraid.

DR. WENTWORTH	All I know is that her husband

DR. WENTWORTH	got himself into some serious trouble,

DR. WENTWORTH	owed some money to the wrong guys.

DR. WENTWORTH	Last I heard, he wound up in a ditch somewhere.

DR. WENTWORTH	After he was gone, Bianca got strung out.

DR. WENTWORTH	She started doing stuff she shouldn't have been doing.

DR. WENTWORTH	If she has any sense,

DR. WENTWORTH	she's probably got the hell out of dodge for a while.

DR. WENTWORTH	That's most likely what she did.

DR. WENTWORTH	Well, goodbye then, Mr... I guess it must be King.

DR. WENTWORTH	Bianca's maiden name, right? King.

DR. WENTWORTH	She told me. Bianca King.

JACOB	Yeah.

DR. WENTWORTH	I'm sorry I can't be any more help,

DR. WENTWORTH	but you'll find her, I'm sure.

DR. WENTWORTH	Bianca plays the innocent, but she's a survivor.

DR. WENTWORTH	Trust me, she's fine,

DR. WENTWORTH	and if there's anything else I can do,

DR. WENTWORTH	you just give me a call, okay?

FRANK	I run 20 hours a day, 19 I work,

FRANK	one I get to myself, one.

FRANK	You know what I do? I come down here.

FRANK	Alone. No staffers. Nothing.

FRANK	We had an agreement.

FRANK	Until the campaign was over, your office in Beverly Hills,

FRANK	me in the chair is the only place we'd meet.

DR. WENTWORTH	We did. We agreed.

DR. WENTWORTH	I've got a situation, Frank.

FRANK	What do you want?

DR. WENTWORTH	Something I want to get rid of.

DR. WENTWORTH	I need one of your special favors.

FRANK	I thought you had business associates

FRANK	who could handle that kind of thing.

DR. WENTWORTH	This is way out of their league.

DR. WENTWORTH	I need this done right. That's why I've come to you.

FRANK	Two men.

FRANK	Twenty-five each.

DR. WENTWORTH	Fifty grand.

DR. WENTWORTH	Jesus.

FRANK	I don't know what this is about

FRANK	and I don't want to know.

FRANK	You don't nickel and dime me on it.

DR. WENTWORTH	All right, I understand.

FRANK	Anybody saw you here, you're my dentist.

FRANK	You came down here personally to give me a campaign donation.

DR. WENTWORTH	Fine. You've got my vote.

DR. WENTWORTH	Don't forget to floss, Frank.

MARTINE	Hello, Dr. Wentworth.

DR. WENTWORTH	Martine, how are you?

MARTINE	Good, how are you?

DR. WENTWORTH	Very well.

MARTINE	I've been flossing like you said.

DR. WENTWORTH	Let's have a look.

DR. WENTWORTH	Very good. Where's Mike?

MIKE	Tom, you've got to hold steady.

MIKE	Just focus on the positives.

MIKE	Yeah, yhere's a core audience out there.

MIKE	You know, we can build on that.

MIKE	I've been down this road a hundred times, pal,

MIKE	and so have you.

MIKE	Now trust me on this.

MIKE	All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

MIKE	Okay, until then.

MIKE	Hey, you still there? Okay, listen to me.

MIKE	I don't care what the contractor says.

MIKE	I don't care what the engineer says.

MIKE	I hate that bathroom and I fucking hate that kitchen.

MIKE	Now you do what I say, or you can go back

MIKE	to designing those fucking strip malls, okay?

MIKE	Jesus. Ugh.

MIKE	I ask my architect to change one little thing,

MIKE	move one little door, he freaks out.

DR. WENTWORTH	Artists... 

MIKE	Ha. Tell me about it.

MIKE	He's worse than a fucking director.

MIKE	I've got a $100 million movie

MIKE	that's tracking like a turkey, and it opens in two weeks.

MIKE	I've got a TV series that's just been picked up,

MIKE	I still haven't casted.

MIKE	And then my dentist, ho ho, my fucking dentist

MIKE	leaves me a message saying he's got to meet me at my house

MIKE	and then he doesn't pick up the phone

MIKE	the rest of the day.

MIKE	This better be good, Paul.

MIKE	So wha-- what is it? What have you come to say?


DR. WENTWORTH	It's Bianca.

DR. WENTWORTH	She's got a brother.

DR. WENTWORTH	He's in town,

DR. WENTWORTH	says he has what we've been looking for.

DR. WENTWORTH	He's out of control, Mike.

MIKE	You told me Bianca was not a problem anymore.

DR. WENTWORTH	Bianca isn't a problem anymore.

DR. WENTWORTH	I'm afraid that's his problem.

MIKE	Oh my God, you didn't... your guys didn't...

MIKE	please tell me no. 

DR. WENTWORTH	Spare me the handwringing.

DR. WENTWORTH	You said handle it, it got handled.

MIKE	What did he want?

DR. WENTWORTH	Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

MIKE	Three quarters of a million bucks,

MIKE	is he fucking nuts?

DR. WENTWORTH	Yes.

DR. WENTWORTH	I spent three hours in my office this morning

DR. WENTWORTH	patching up one of Duke's men.

DR. WENTWORTH	This isn't negotiable, Mike. You've got no leverage here.

DR. WENTWORTH	I've seen what this guy can do. He's not like his sister.

MIKE	Sounds to me he's just like his fucking sister.

DR. WENTWORTH	His teeth...

MIKE	His teeth?

DR. WENTWORTH	They're not like hers.

DR. WENTWORTH	Compound fillings, recent bridge.

DR. WENTWORTH	This guy takes care of himself.

MIKE	You've seen this guy's teeth?

DR. WENTWORTH	Oh yes, you can tell a lot from a person's teeth.

MIKE	Like what?

DR. WENTWORTH	Like, he's not going to go away.

DR. WENTWORTH	Like, he's not going to screw up.

DR. WENTWORTH	We have to deal with him, Mike.

MIKE	Seven hundred and fifty?

MIKE	No fucking way.

DR. WENTWORTH	Did Bianca ever talk to you about where she was from?

MIKE	South Africa somewhere. 

DR. WENTWORTH	Cape Flats.

DR. WENTWORTH	Has one of the highest murder rates in the world.

DR. WENTWORTH	The Number Gangs, you heard of them?

DR. WENTWORTH	Bianca got out.

DR. WENTWORTH	Her brother stayed.

DR. WENTWORTH	We have no idea what he's capable of.

DR. WENTWORTH	There is an alternative,

DR. WENTWORTH	but you probably won't want to consider it.

MIKE	Try me.

DR. WENTWORTH	I spoke to Leary.

DR. WENTWORTH	He's willing to help us out.

MIKE	Leary? Are you out of your fucking mind?

MIKE	Leary is running for office, for Christ's sake.

MIKE	He finds out he's on that thing too,

MIKE	we're all dead.

DR. WENTWORTH	This is your mess, Mike.

MIKE	How much does Leary want?

DR. WENTWORTH	A hundred grand. Cash.

MIKE	First you fix our teeth. Then you suck our dicks.

MIKE	Then you suck our blood.

MIKE	Fuck you, you tick, you fucking nobody.

MIKE	Fucking nobody. Fucking dentist.

DR. WENTWORTH	
That seven fifty, I'm still going to need it.
MIKE	
You said a hundred. What are you talking about?

MIKE	I gave you a hundred. 

DR. WENTWORTH	Not for Leary, Mike.

DR. WENTWORTH	For me.

MIKE	You're squeezing me?

MIKE	You're fucking squeezing me?

MIKE	That's a fucking loser's plan, pal.

MIKE	You arranged all this. It was your fucking party.

DR. WENTWORTH	Yes, but at your house.

DR. WENTWORTH	I'm there, but I'm not in the room.

DR. WENTWORTH	I'm not doing what you're doing, Mike,

DR. WENTWORTH	and I'm just your fucking nobody dentist.

DR. WENTWORTH	Worst I get is a red face, but you, everything you have,

DR. WENTWORTH	you'll be gone, Mike.

DR. WENTWORTH	Out. Finito.

MIKE	Fuck you. Fuck you!

MIKE	Fuck you!

MAN	How's he?

MAN	Are you okay, Mike? Is there anything I can do for you?

MIKE	No. Y-you take off. I'll see you in the morning.

MIKE	Where are the boys?

MAN	Oh, ah, the usual... killing each other.

MAN ON PHONE	Yes? 

DR. WENTWORTH	This is Paul Wentworth.

DR. WENTWORTH	Frank Leary gave me your number.

MAN ON PHONE	What's the job?
OFFICER 1	Pull over to the right.

OFFICER 1	License and registration please, sir.

OFFICER 1	Are you aware you should have registered this vehicle

OFFICER 1	two years ago, sir?

JACOB	It belongs to a friend.

OFFICER 1	A friend?

OFFICER 1	Your license, please.

JACOB	I'm sorry, officer, my wallet's at my hotel.

OFFICER 1	You're required by law

OFFICER 1	to have your license with you whenever you drive.

JACOB	Yeah, my apologies. That was my mistake.

OFFICER 1	Step out of the car please, sir.

JACOB	You see, officer--

OFFICER 1	Step out of the car, please, sir.

JACOB	(grunts)

OFFICER 1	What's your name?

JACOB	Jacob King.

OFFICER 2	JJ Motel, 1723 Argyle, room 210.

OFFICER 2	Jacob King.

OFFICER 2	Yeah, it's him.

OFFICER 2	What do you want us to do with him?

OFFICER 2	Yeah.

JACOB	[indistinct]

JACOB	They're going to kill me.

CHILD	Mommy, look!

OFFICER 1	Hey, calm the fuck down!

JACOB	Please help me, help me.

OFFICER 1	Calm down.

OFFICER 1	Calm down. 

JACOB	They're gonna kill me.

OFFICER	Calm the fuck down.

JACOB	(grunting)

OFFICER 2	Let's finish him here.

OFFICER 2	We can leave him in the dumpster.

OFFICER 1	He said the harbor,

OFFICER 1	we'll do the harbor.

OFFICER 2	Fuck the harbor, let's just go.

OFFICER 1	Get the car.

OFFICER 1	Get the fucking car.

OFFICER 2	Fine.

JACOB	(grunting)

MAN	Hey!

MAN	You!

MAN	What are you doing over there?

OFFICER 1	Get the fuck out of here.

MAN	You a cop?

OFFICER 1	Yeah, what's it to you? I said to get the fuck out.

MAN	Okay. Okay, man. We don't want no trouble.

OFFICER 1	Fuck!

OFFICER 2	Where the hell is he?

OFFICER 2	How the hell did you lose him?

OFFICER 2	What the fuck are we gonna tell him?

OFFICER 2	If he finds out about this--

OFFICER 1	No, we tell him he's dead.

OFFICER 1	We tell him he's fucking dead!

KELLY	Jacob...

KELLY	Oh, fuck. That's it, okay, keep going.

KELLY	(grunting)

KELLY	Shit. (grunts)

BIANCA	I need your help, Jacob.

DR. WENTWORTH	You made a sound investment. Problem's gone.

MIKE	Good.

MIKE	Good. Excellent.

DR. WENTWORTH	I still want that seven-fifty.

DR. WENTWORTH	I'm giving you 48 hours. I'll be waiting for your call.

MIKE	Jesus Christ, Pauly. You know what you are?

MIKE	You're nothing but a cheap blackmailing fuck.

DR. WENTWORTH	And what are you, Mike?

KELLY	Why are you just sleeping?

KELLY	Did you get right back there? That's right.

KELLY	Okay, I love you, sweet dreams.

KELLY	Don't let the bed bugs bite.

DR. WENTWORTH	How many times, guys?

DR. WENTWORTH	King's dead.

ZICO	All right, we checked the morgue.

ZICO	Nobody pulled out of water. No black John Does either.

ZICO	They all got names. King's not one of them.

ZICO	And the car he was driving? Out-of-state plates.

MAN	Where'd he get it, huh? Huh?

DR. WENTWORTH	Jesus, guys. He stole it.

DR. WENTWORTH	Who knows? Who fucking cares?

DR. WENTWORTH	Guy's far out to sea by now. He's crab food.

DUKE	Why leave him, Paul? Why take that risk?

DUKE	My guys could have handled King.

DR. WENTWORTH	Oh yeah?

DR. WENTWORTH	Like they handled him last time?

ZICO	Now that’s—

DUKE	(indistinct)

DUKE	What did the cops cost?

DR. WENTWORTH	Fifty large each. Preston paid.

DUKE	Paid you? Or did you pay Leary?

DUKE	I don't like this, Paul. Any of it.

DUKE	There is shit you're not telling me.

DUKE	There always is. You leveraging Preston?

DUKE	Is that it?

DUKE	Huh?

DUKE	What are you getting?

DUKE	We're partners, Paul.

DUKE	We split down the middle. That's the deal.

DUKE	I find out you're fucking me again,

DUKE	it'll be last time.

DR. WENTWORTH	Don't get all Balkan on me, Duke.

DR. WENTWORTH	You think my clients give a damn

DR. WENTWORTH	who supplies me the drugs and the girls?

DR. WENTWORTH	You think I do?

DR. WENTWORTH	Bianca's dead and gone.

DR. WENTWORTH	So's her brother.

KELLY	What is this?

JACOB	"Speak no evil."

JACOB	Good words.

JACOB	My little brother was "hear no evil."

JACOB	I could have thought Bianca was "see no evil."

JACOB	She was my sister.

JACOB	The girl you asked me about in the photo.

JACOB	We got the tattoos when we were kids.

JACOB	Called ourselves the three Kings.

JACOB	It was Bianca's idea.

JACOB	Good thoughts, good words,

JACOB	good deeds.

JACOB	Bianca always saw the good in everything.

KELLY	What was your little brother's name?

JACOB	saac. He was so smart, such a little prankster.

JACOB	(chuckles)

JACOB	So much so that he ended up in trouble, in prison.

JACOB	By the time he got out, he had become affiliated

JACOB	with one of the Numbers gangs.

JACOB	But the gangs, in blood, you go into them,

JACOB	and only in blood do you get out.

JACOB	After Isaac was killed,

JACOB	Bianca couldn't see any good in the Cape Flats.

JACOB	She blamed me for his death.

JACOB	Said I should have been able to stop it.

JACOB	Maybe she was right.

JACOB	She met her husband, ran away.

JACOB	They came here.

JACOB	Maybe I should have been able to stop that too.

KELLY	Did you find her?

JACOB	Found her in the mortuary.

JACOB	She'd been beaten and tortured.

KELLY	I'm so sorry.

KELLY	Do you think it's the same people who beat you?

JACOB	Yeah. She didn't think she could come to me,

JACOB	until it was too late.

KELLY	Maybe some people don't want to be stopped.

BOTH	(speaking in Korean)

JACOB	Can you look at what's on this?

MAN	Yeah, I can try.

MAN	(speaks in Korean)

MAN	It's a Quicktime file. A video.

JACOB	Yeah.

MAN	You know the password?

JACOB	No, I don't.

MAN	Okay, it's encrypted and it's above my skill set,

MAN	but I know a person who could hook you up.

MAN	It'll just take two or three days.

JACOB	Maybe we can get to the audio.

BIANCA	Armand, I want you to go with Mike.

BIANCA	Mike will take care of you.

BIANCA	(garbled speech)

MAN	I don't know, man.

MAN	Sounds like some kind of porno.

JACOB	Sorry.

MAN	I just got some news.

MAN	That car King was driving was registered in New Mexico.

MAN	Kelly Johnson.

MAN	She's staying at the same hotel that King was.

DUKE	That's the news? King stole her car?

MAN	No. She never reported the car stolen.

KELLY	Hey, earth to Boot.

KELLY	Yoo-hoo! I got pizza.

KELLY	You're crazy, come here.

KELLY	So why are you watching so much TV?

KELLY	You're turning into a zombie. All right, there we go.

KELLY	Do you want Sprite or Coke?

DAUGHTER	Sprite. 

KELLY	Sprite it is.

DAUGHTER	Can I have some cookie dough after dinner?

KELLY	Ah, yeah, you can.

KELLY	Hey, I got pizza for you.

KELLY	It's, uh, pepperoni.

KELLY	So... want to sit down?

KELLY	Do you want some beer?

KELLY	I don't actually have any, but I could go pick some up.

KELLY	Where are you going?

KELLY	Is this about Bianca?

KELLY	What difference is it going to make to her now?

MARTINE	Okay, see you in the morning.

MARTINE	Drive safe. 

PATTY	Call if you need me, honey.

MIKE	Hey Scott, you still here?

JACOB	I'm Bianca's brother. I'm in your office.

JACOB	I've got what you want and you've got what I want.

MIKE	How did you--

MIKE	So where is it?

JACOB	Play it.

JACOB	Play it!

ARMAND	It's okay, Mike.

MIKE	Look at the camera. Tell me you love me.

MIKE	Tell me.

ARMAND	I love you so much.

JACOB	(shouts)

JACOB	What are you doing with the boy?

JACOB	This is why you killed her.

MIKE	Can you believe it?

MIKE	Leveraging me.

MIKE	She wanted the boy back

MIKE	less than a week after she sold him to me.

JACOB	Bianca sold you her kid?

MIKE	He wasn't her kid.

MIKE	He belonged to her idiot husband

MIKE	who got killed by his gangster pals.

MIKE	That's why they were pimping her out.

MIKE	To make the money back that he stole from them.

MIKE	She sold me Armand to pay off the debt.

MIKE	Then the stupid bitch changed her mind.

MIKE	Armand's happy here.

MIKE	He's got friends. I've given him a home.

MIKE	He was living on the street.

MIKE	I'm a decent guy.

MIKE	Bianca may have been strung out, but we had a deal.

MIKE	What the fuck was she thinking?

MIKE	That Armand would go back?

MIKE	To her?

MIKE	Seven-fifty, right?

MIKE	That's what Wentworth said you wanted.

MIKE	You know the irony in all this?

MIKE	Turns out you're the only straight dealer

MIKE	in this whole goddamn mess.

MIKE	Okay, just-- just take a breath.

MIKE	Just breathe for a minute.

MIKE	Breaking and entering, self-defense,

MIKE	plus you're black.

MIKE	(grunting)

JACOB	(phone ringing) 

SCOTT	Hey Mike?

SCOTT	I left my phone somewhere.

SCOTT	Oh, God!

SCOTT	Please! Please, what do you want?

SCOTT	Help, Mike! Mike, help!

SCOTT	Stop, stop, Please...

JACOB	Sit!

SCOTT	Please don’t, don’t do anything to him. I don’t have anything.

JACOB	Only what I tell you.

JACOB	Mike shot himself. The safe is open.

JACOB	There's money everywhere.

JACOB	Now tell him.

DR. WENTWORTH	Scott? What's wrong? What is it?

SCOTT	I walked into Mike's office and he's killed himself.

SCOTT	He blew his brains out.

SCOTT	There's just this money all over the place.

SCOTT	You've got to get over here, Paul.

SCOTT	You really do.

SCOTT	(grunting)

JACOB	Mr. [indistinct]

JACOB	This is Jacob King. I'm at Preston's.

JACOB	Dr. Wentworth is on his way.

SCOTT	(grunting)

JACOB	I'm Jacob, Bianca's brother.

JACOB	I'm going to take you to a safe place.

ARMAND	Get away from me.

JACOB	Get dressed. We don't have much time.

ARMAND	(muffled scream)

JACOB	Shhh... Trust me. I am your friend.

SCOTT	King... his name is King.

SCOTT	He killed Mike. He did it. He killed him.

SCOTT	Oh God. Paul, thank God you came.

SCOTT	You gotta cut me loose. We gotta get out of here.

SCOTT	We've got to get out of here.

SCOTT	Paul!

ARMAND	(muffled scream)

JACOB	Shhh.

SCOTT	We gotta get out of here!

SCOTT	Paul! Help me. Help me!

SCOTT	We've got to get out of here.

SCOTT	Come here, you've got to help me.

SCOTT	Cut me loose. Please. We've got to get out of here.

SCOTT	What are you doing?

SCOTT	Please...

SCOTT	(grunting)

MARTINE	Dr. Wentworth?

MARTINE	You want to stay for dinner?

DR. WENTWORTH	No.

JACOB	You're going to die if you stay here.

DR. WENTWORTH	I have to get back.

MARTINE	What's going on?

MARTINE	Wait... No... you wait here...

DR. WENTWORTH	Zico...

ZICO	(speaking in foreign language)

ZICO	(grunting)

DR. WENTWORTH	Duke, you've got to believe me.

DR. WENTWORTH	I was going to split that.

DUKE	He called me, King.

DUKE	He told me you'd be here.

DR. WENTWORTH	The bag was just lying there.

DUKE	I was wondering where this was.

ZICO	Motherfucker!

JACOB	Sit right here.

JACOB	Where is your mother?

JACOB	We have to leave here right away.

KELLY'S	(screams) Stop it!

JACOB	Go to your room.

KELLY	(screaming)

JACOB	[indistinct]

KELLY	Mommy!

KELLY	No!

KELLY	Mommy! No!

KELLY	(screams)

KELLY	Mommy!

JACOB	Armand!

JACOB	Armand!

JACOB	Armand!

JACOB	Armand!

MAN	All aboard, ma'am.

MAN	Welcome back, Detective.

MAN	How was your holiday?

JACOB	All right.

MAN	I'll grab your bag.

MAN	Did you get to see your sister in Los Angeles?

JACOB	Yeah, I did.

MAN	And how is she doing?

JACOB	She's doing fine.
