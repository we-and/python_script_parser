??	Morning Mama.

??	Hello Granny.

??	Wake up, wake up.

??	Let's go.

??	How're you?

??	Hello.

??	Did you sleep well?

??	Listen, your mother and father are leaving. Okay?

??	We will be back very soon. Okay?

??	No!

??	Behave yourselves

??	No!

??	Take care of your sister.

??	Muah! Again. Muah!

??	Behave yourself and don't bother your sister.

??	Goodbye.

??	Don't miss us. I'm joking

??	I'm going to miss them.

??	She's not the second coming of Jesus that everyone thinks she is.

??	You think so?

??	I think she's in bed with Drake.

??	My boss? You're wrong.

??	I think your boss is funding her campaign.

??	If that was the case, Frank would've said something.

??	You're a PA.

??	You don't know...

??	I'm actually tapped to become the CEO of Shift Inc one day.

??	Drake will never make you a CEO.

??	Stop it, Pumla.

??	Why are we always talking about Frank Drake?

??	Thank you.

??	What else can you tell me about Premier Zwide?

??	She was friends with Mom and Dad.

??	They were together in the MK unit.

??	But when I interviewed her about it, she didn't want to comment.

??	So, you know nothing out of the ordinary about her?

??	Nothing besides that I think your boss is funding her campaign.

??	Oh, come on!

??	I would have told you.

??	If that was true I would know.

??	You know what...

??	Let me pay this bill.

??	Oh fuck that, you owe me dessert.

??	Sit down.

??	You want to rob me of my dessert? What's wrong with you?

??	Aren't you on a diet?

??	Piss off!

??	This is the sample we are working on.

??	Yeah. And it's going into that machine over there.

??	Hey...

??	Yeah, yeah, I'll be ready.

??	Thanks for picking me up.

??	No, we've got to prep for the meeting.

??	I'll see you in a bit. Young Skywalker.

??	And...

??	Well then just shut down the fucking electricity, what's the problem?

??	I don't care if... Listen... Listen to me...

??	Those fucking Nigerians have been screwing us around now for months.

??	Okay?

??	Yes.

??	Shut it down! Okay.

??	Get the cheese!

??	Siri, open Pornhub.

??	Yeah.

??	Fucking hell.

??	That's beautiful.

??	Hey Baby.

??	Morning sir.

??	Did you have a good evening?

??	Great.

??	Look at this place...

??	Huh?

??	How beautiful is this?

??	It's gorgeous.

??	If only they had known what was under there.

??	Would have made them rich a long time ago.

??	I really don't know how you organise your life with so many cellphones.

??	Signal's gone...

??	It would be, we're in a lift.

??	So, did you go to the range this morning?

??	I did Frank, but...

??	I must be honest, I really don't see the point.

??	But, how did it feel when you pulled the trigger?

??	Powerful.

??	Yeah, and a CEO needs that power in their hearts at all times.

??	So, CEO's still on the table?

??	Well, you play your cards right and the world is your oyster.

??	He, he, he.

??	One word about this, and CEO is off the table.

??	Aye aye, captain.

??	Morning.

??	Morning.

??	Morning everyone.

??	Alright Vashnia...

??	How's the mine evaluation going?

??	Well, data has been collated, we should have something as early as next week.

??	How's that going to affect next years projections?

??	Friday is fine.

??	Well, we do have another issue at the mine.

??	The environmental minister is pushing through a new legislative change which impacts on environmental damage.

??	And?

??	Well, currently we pay about two million rand in fines per anum.

??	Because we don't adhere to environmental protocol.

??	So, it's cheaper to pay the fines than to fix the 	damage that our mines have done.

??	So, if it all goes through, then it's going to cost us hundreds of millions.

??	Well, let's wait until the mine evaluation report comes through, have a look at it, and see who we can lobby.

??	Alright guys, come, let's wrap this up, my phone's going crazy.

??	Thank you very much everyone.

??	Frank, can we have a quick moment?

??	It's fine Aluta.

??	Okay.

??	I'll wait outside.

??	What's the deal?

??	I thought the mine evaluation report hadn't come in?

??	That's for your eyes only.

??	Power! To the people!

??	The land! Our land!

??	Hold it comrade.

??	We've heard your cries.

??	What happend here was a disgrace.

??	I agree as the government, we've let you down.

??	But what is my promise to you?

??	I'm not saying all of this because...

??	I'm campaigning to be your next president.

??	My people, listen.

??	Hello.

??	You're a celebrity now my sister. I'm watching you here.

??	I'm sure your boss won't be happy when he finds out that...

??	The Premier is blaming him for the blackouts.

??	Hey, you know Frank Drake is a good man.

??	And you? So, why did you call me?

??	To find out how you're doing?

??	There will never be blackouts again in this area.

??	There will never be blackouts again in this area.

??	Power! To the people!

??	Ladies...

??	What do you think of my accuracy?

??	You're improving.

??	Most assistants would say, you're the best shooter in the world sir.

??	Okay...

??	Your turn.

??	Mr, Drake...

??	I...Need me to feel the power of that moment...

??	In my heart... Okay, okay.

??	Keeping that girl this close is foolish Frank.

??	She's a genuine talent...

??	I won't hold her past against her.

??	Let's talk business.

??	Hmm, your rating's been dropping.

??	Tell me something I don't know.

??	I want to give Mkhuze mine back to the people.

??	That means, that you get to nationalise a mine...

??	And win an election.

??	What's the catch?

??	Hmm, there's no catch...

??	As long as the government is prepared to pay the bill for a very rich mine.

??	Fire in the hole.

??	Brothers...

??	Let me tell you about smart things...

??	Cryptocurrency is the one. It's the one, I'm telling you.

??	More especially the Ripple. I've been on it for a long time.

??	When I get out of here my money will be reaching the ceiling.

??	I swear gents.

??	You know Crypto right?

??	And the Ripple?

??	Nothing?

??	Come on, gents. Are you serious?

??	Gents, Mandoza is gone.

??	Hey, Ndozin.

??	Nkosi, you have a visitor.

??	I'll be back gents.

??	Alright. Alright.

??	Are my eyes deceiving me?

??	Tell me, why are they releasing you early?

??	I made a deal.

??	As of right now...

??	I work for the government.

??	I'm their cyber security expert. I'll stay at a safe house.

??	Tell me, do you still work for Drake?

??	Why do you ask?

??	Do you want to use me again, to hack into Franks system?

??	But I apologised...You apologised.

??	For which part?

??	Because you broke the law? Or because you lied and just wanted money?

??	The money I took was nothing. He wasn't even going to notice it.

??	I was doing it for us.

??	Hack...

??	I came to tell you in person...

??	Not to come to me when you get out of here.

??	I'll send you the address of where I'll be staying.

??	Gentlemen, this way.

??	Welcome to the story.

??	Is this the new South Africa?

??	From living in homelands to living on top of mines.

??	Stop judging.

??	You should be thanking me for getting you an exclusive.

??	Let's see.

??	We have established the value of Mkhuze mine...

??	At one billion, six hundred and forty millon rand.

??	Oh my god.

??	My friend, this is a bargain.

??	As the government we see this as a deal worth making.

??	Because we are comitted to bringing the land back to our people.

??	Premier...

??	what you're doing...

??	will make people support you during the elections.

??	Mr Gumede, no.

??	That's true, but that's not the reason I'm doing this.

??	I didn't know that...

??	buying a mine was this easy.

??	Willing buyer. Willing seller.

??	We are going to do the interview where it's more scenic.

??	No no no, that's not true, Mr. Drake has not been funding my presidential campaign.

??	My campaign has been open, it's been ethical and it's been very transparent.

??	Can we steer this interview back to the mine please?

??	Of course Mr. Drake.

??	Can I ask, why are you selling the mine at such a generous price?

??	I'm old, my family's wealthy and I really believe it's time to give back the land.

??	People say mining is a sunset industry. How many more viable years does your mine have left?

??	Many.

??	So, you're not giving back land that is costly and worthless?

??	Yoh, Aluta, where did you find the journalist to do this interview hey?

??	She's throwing spears straight at my jugular.

??	It's her sister...

??	Really?

??	He, he, hey...

??	Using nepotism to get the scoop?

??	Young lady man, come, where is your professional ethics?

??	Please answer the question.

??	Sure...

??	A mine like Mkhuze mine, still has ,  years in it.

??	Now, that's a lot of employment for a village like Somkhele

??	A lot of food on a lot of tables. Plus, the idea of giving back the land after all these years, that's immeasurable.

??	My girl, you're not going to actually question that, are you?

??	What the fuck are you doing?

??	Sir I... You let her blindside us.

??	Who's side are you on? Yours.

??	The companies...

??	Well then act like it okay, you're not the only young black talented thing out there .

??	You know if you break this story, it's going to be big.

??	Not just big, but right.

??	I've been telling you that Nomusa and Drake are in bed together.

??	When you’ve got something real for me to read, I’ll need to call the lawyers. Make sure we’re legally protected.

??	I’m just missing the key piece.

??	What is it?

??	The mine reports...

??	If I’m right, and the mine is without value, if the environmental impact requirements are added on...

??	and the lower strata has lower grade coal... Then it means this whole deal is corrupt.

??	But how are you going to prove it?

??	By getting the company financials.

??	When is this deal going on?

??	Very soon.

??	What stresses me out, is that by the time the law tries to stop this, it'll be too late.

??	The people of Somkhele would've been screwed already.

??	So, why don't we get your sister to whistle blow?

??	Or I could break in.

??	You're joking?

??	We’re journalists, not criminals.

??	Just get your sister to reason. You say she’s a good person, right?

??	Show her what you’ve put together in the last six months.

??	Then beg her to give you the piece that’ll tie your conspiracy theory together.

??	Lulu!

??	Pumla...

??	I didn’t give you my key so that you can scare me in the middle of the night.

??	Hello...

??	Okay, let me prepare the spare bedroom.

??	It's only one glass.

??	How many more before this one?

??	Okay, three.

??	Listen...

??	I want you to do something for me.

??	Speak.

??	I want you to get me the mine evaluation reports.

??	The originals.

??	You’re asking me to steal from my boss? No.

??	I knew you'd say that.

??	Here's proof that your boss is corrupt.

??	I don't have time for all of this.

??	This is completely circumstantial.

??	Look closer. No!

??	Drake is a good man, I don't have time for this.

??	Just look at the damn paperwork!

??	Pumla, enough! What's wrong with you?

??	Are you trying to ruin my career?

??	That's not it.

??	Listen, Pumla. I'm sorry, okay.

??	I know that I got the bursary.

??	I'm sorry that I'm the one who made the money, but it's not like I don't try to support you.

??	You know very well that what you're saying is wrong.

??	Please go.

??	I'm not going anywhere until I make you see what's going on.

??	If this deal goes through it will ruin the people of Somkhele. Don't you see it?

??	You need to stop pretending you care about the people, okay?

??	I'll call you a cab.

??	I'm going to bed, see yourself out.

??	I knew it. Pumla, I'm tired of this.

??	No. Pumla, I'm tired of this. Listen.

??	I knew something was wrong with this mine deal.

??	I've got proof.

??	What are you doing?
??	Give it to me.

??	I need this. Give it to me.

??	I'm tired of this! Move away, man!

??	Wait! Let her go, let her go! She's my sister

??	Get away from her, Pumla?

??	If you don't want me to press charges...

??	Get away from me!

??	Hey!

??	What the hell is going on here?

??	It's risky, but I mean, the upside is...

??	Jeez, it's absolutely massive.

??	And besides, what are the chances of five Nigerian oil refineries freezing us out at the same time.

??	Ja...

??	We can under write with the sale of Mkhuze mine.

??	Ok, do it.

??	Ja, speak.

??	We've got a huge problem.

??	Your protege’s sister broke into our offices and stole the real evaluation of the mine!

??	If she releases that, I mean, you and I could be arrested for fraud!

??	We’ll be tried in the press!

??	Do you have that journalist’s number?

??	Yes.

??	Text it to me.

??	Okay.

??	Find the owner of the number I've just sent you.

??	Redact all the information.

??	Avoid...

??	Deleting her if you can.

??	Got you motherfuckers.

??	Shhh.

??	Listen.

??	I just want the information. Okay? I'm not going to kill you.

??	Just don't scream, okay?

??	 [Sceams]

??	Hey!

??	Pumla?

??	Pumla, Pumla, Pumla?

??	Get up. Get up.

??	No!

??	Pumla, get up.

??	Pumla, wake up!

??	Miss Ndlovu.

??	I need you to come to the station tomorrow to make a statement.

??	Should I get someone to take you home?

??	Sergeant, take her home.

??	Boss, is pathology responsible for transporting snakes?

??	You see snakes here?

??	Python... Python.

??	Python.

??	Let's go.

??	I had to kill the journalist.

??	Oh, fuck.

??	It appears the young journalist committed suicide.

??	Those close to her say she was troubled.

??	We tried to speak to her editor but her newspaper declined to comment on what they call an “active story.”

??	However, people close to her have described her as obsessed with the death of her parents

??	a struggle hero and his wife who’s car exploded in the mid ’s.

??	Despite Pumla Ndlovu’s courageous work as a journalist

??	It appears she still struggled with the demons of her past.

??	Hello.

??	No.

??	No. No.

??	I don't want to comment, please leave me alone.

??	I need to see detective Viljoen.

??	Don't you see where the back of the queue is

??	Move! I'm not going anywhere until I see him.

??	I want him to explain why he ruled my sister's murder as a suicide.

??	Put the cellphone away, Switch it off!

??	I'm not going anywhere until I see detective Viljoen.

??	Detective Viljoen? Yes?

??	Someone wants to see you. Let her in. 

??	Why did you rule my sisters death as suicide?

??	Because she killed herself. No. That's a lie.

??	It's true. We call it auto asphyxiation.

??	It's the keeping of air away from the lungs.

??	It looks like your sister was into weird things.

??	What the fuck are you talking about?

??	Your sister strangled herself.

??	I saw her being strangled.

??	What did you see? I... No. I saw hands...

??	Listen, don't play games with me.

??	What you can do, is call this person.

??	She can help you.

??	She didn't commit suicide.

??	I don't know what you want me to say now.

??	If you want to see the autopsy report, I'll gladly give it to you.

??	Where, O death, is your sting.

??	The sting of death is sin.

??	And the power of sin is the law.

??	But, thanks be to God.

??	He gives us the victory, through our Lord, Jesus Christ.

??	Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters.

??	Stand firm, let nothing move you.

??	Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord.

??	Because you know, that your labour in the Lord is not in vain.

??	Drake will never make you CEO.

??	Stop it Pumla.

??	You're not the only young, black, talented thing out there.

??	You know what? You're just a jaded, cynical journalist, who knows that bad stories sell.

??	As we say...

??	Dust to dust...

??	Ashes to ashes.

??	If this deal goes through, it will ruin the people of Somkhele. Don't you see it?

??	Stop pretending that you care about those people.

??	Aluta...

??	How are you doing?

??	My sister's dead, how do you think I'm doing?

??	Yeah, I'm sorry, I never know what to say at a time like this, I'm not really good with emotions.

??	It wasn't suicide.

??	Excuse me?

??	She stole that file from our office and then she was dead.

??	I saw her get murdered.

??	You witnessed her get...

??	Why didn't you tell the cops?

??	Look me in the eye and tell me you've got nothing to do with what's going on.

??	You know what?

??	Get stuffed.

??	You go and grieve...

??	And when you're feeling sane you call me again alright?

??	I know you've got someting to do with this.

??	No I don't, because really, I didn't.

??	I forgive you.

??	This once.

??	I want the original evaluation of the long term pricing of that mine.

??	And the quality of the coal.

??	You get me that, and I'll believe you.

??	Go and grieve...

??	We'll talk later.

??	Keep an eye on this number...

??	Don't do anything without my permission.

??	I didn't know she kept this picture here.

??	Ah, no, she had that the first time she arrived here.

??	Do you think she committed suicide?

??	No...

??	It's just that uhg...

??	The police aren't interested in my version.

??	And you just let it go?

??	No, no no, we're considering options.

??	Mxolisi, what was she busy with?

??	She wanted to prove that Zwide, had a corrupt relationship with Frank Drake.
	
??	And she believed that it all started early in the eighties.

??	You know, circumstantial, but she wanted to nail them.

??	On this um, bogus mine deal.

??	She steals the proof, and hey presto, she’s dead.

??	Can I please see her files?

??	We have nothing, the police confiscated everything.

??	They had a warrant.

??	And online?

??	Have you got a cloud password?

??	No.

??	Then we have nothing.

??	Thank you.

??	I've been thinking about you.

??	Are you going to send me what I asked for?

??	I'm on your side.

??	Then do what I said.

??	Pumla's gone...

??	There's nothing we can do about that anymore.

??	And I know you're angry, you want to lash out, not at me.

??	Not at someone who's going to give you an empire.

??	I want those files Frank, I want those files Frank I...

??	Come in to the office, we'll talk face to face.

??	Think of your future.

??	I'll take no answer as a yes then.

??	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fffffuck.

??	Damn!

??	I've been dying of boredom.

??	Here. This...

??	Has the most beautiful women.

??	Let's see. Oh!

??	I'll enjoy myself with this.

??	Don't make trouble. Don't worry sir, I won't.

??	You said an hour?
Yes.

??	It'll take two rounds here.

??	Go for it.

??	Hey!

??	What a cake. Damn!

??	Brother! Brother!

??	Are you still here?

??	Hack, I need to know...

??	I need to know how to hack Pumla's cloud account.

??	Hey. Hi. How are you?

??	Hack. Hack. Hack. I'm begging you. Please.

??	I need to know everything about a case that she was working on.

??	Is it about her death?

??	Yes.

??	Okay. Let's go.

??	Damn. It's high.

??	Damn! Are you alright Hack?

??	Don't worry. I'm fine.

??	Let's go.

??	Hey! Hey! Hey you!

??	Hey, hey. What's going on here?

??	What's happening? Officer?

??	With what? You're calling me an officer to soften me up?

??	No, no. I have this lady with me.

??	I'm with her. I wanted to...
Oh...

??	I'm going to...

??	I'm going to enjoy myself a bit. Please don't tell the boss.

??	Okay, it's fine.
??	I'll be quick.

??	Go do your thing. Be quick.

??	When you're done, bring her here to size ten.

??	Don't worry, I'll do that.

??	Okay then, go.

??	Thank you officer.
Go!

??	You're disgusting. What was I supposed to say?

??	Alright.

??	Let me see.

??	Christ Devin, what do you want, It's nearly two A.M here.

??	Frank, someone's out bribed us.

??	Tell me you're fucking joking?

??	We are shut out of all five refineries, we can't get the oil out of the country.

??	We can't refine it. Frank, this just put us a billion dollars into the red.

??	Last we spoke, you said we could underwrite it with the mine sale.

??	But it hasn't gone through!

??	Then I don't know what to say. We're dead.

??	I'll talk to you tomorrow.

??	Alright, I'm in.

??	There you go.

??	That was quick.

??	You can't question a master about his skills. This was nothing.

??	Tell me, what are you looking for?

??	What?

??	Pumla claims Frank Drake was sold Mkhuze mine for assisting in the assassination of MK forces by Pik Botha.

??	You must be joking?

??	According to her Nomusa and Frank have been doing this for years.

??	Apparently Frank was sold the mine, when it had  years worth of coal to mine...

??	At , tons a year.

??	But he's been mining double, so...

??	So, it's worthless now.

??	Wait, is this hard evidence?

??	No.

??	It's circumstantial, but, look at the pictures...

??	And the meetings, it's compelling.

??	This is what Pumla was trying to show me the whole time.

??	This is what she was trying to show me, and I wouldn't fucking listen!

??	Listen. Calm down.

??	Don't tell me to calm down, calm down for what?

??	You know what? We're going to finish her quest.

??	We're gonna get that son of a bitch.

??	Mr. Gumede...

??	I forgot that you're not well.

??	I was not going to ask you to meet out here.

??	It's not a problem my child.

??	What happened to your sister is very painful.

??	Oh, but my child...

??	Please accept my condolences.

??	Pumla was doing an investigation about the mine deal.

??	I saw all the evidence in her files.

??	Really?

??	The evidence shows that the mine is worthless.

??	Wait a minute my child...

??	Don't you work for Frank?

??	Frank Drake?

??	Yes, that's true.

??	I'm on leave.

??	I'm mourning my sister, who I suspect was killed by Frank Drake.

??	Damn.

??	That's a tough one. Tell me...

??	What do you want from me?

??	I believe he's stealing over a billion rand from the government.

??	And leaving you with an unusable mine.

??	Do you have proof of that?

??	No.

??	But, you can get it.

??	Who, me?

??	How?

??	There are two days left...

??	Before the signing of the deal.

??	If you can get coal samples from the mine. 

??	I can get them analyzed, and you'll know before the signing.

??	We have invested % of our assets into those oil mines in Nigeria...

??	With what’s just happened Shift Inc could quickly be nothing, Frank. 

??	Don't panic.

??	Just like you I’ve invested all my eggs in one basket on your advice! If Shift Inc. collapses...

??	Oh, ye, of little faith.

??	Ah, Nomusa.

??	Thanks for joining us.

??	Let me get straight to the point.

??	We want the money that you're going to pay for the mine today.

??	You're joking, right Frank?

??	No. Not really.

??	We want that cash transferred immediatly, right now.

??	Frank, you know I can't do that until the deal is signed.

??	Even then, It takes months to process.

??	You know this.

??	Vashnia, have I ever told you how Nomusa and myself first got into business?

??	No.

??	No. And I won't. And no one will.

??	Unless...

??	You can ensure, that that cash is transferred today.

??	I'll, I'll make it happen Frank.

??	Is it so hard?!

??	Hey Frank.
??	Yes, come.

??	Ndlovu is at the mine, I'm actually watching her right now.

??	Wait, wait...

??	Listen, some guy, I can't really see who it is, just slipped something to her.

??	Samples? Could it have been coal?

??	I don't know.

??	It's thing after thing with this girl.

??	Last time it was the hacker guy, this morning it was the village, now it's the mine.

??	I'm telling you, this loose string will unravel your mine deal.

??	Get rid of her.

??	And whoever she's involved with.

??	You make sure that their disappearance looks unconnected.

??	You make it look like a random violent attack on a girl who was alone when she shouldn’t have been.

??	And at that moment.

??	You remind her that she had another choice once.

??	Ernest!

??	Why is this place so deserted?

??	It's a half day today, everyone's at some team building workshop.

??	Glad you gave me an excuse not to go.

??	Listen, I need to know the quality of this coal.

??	Um, give me six hours.

??	Why are we doing this anyway?

??	To find out if the people of Somkhele have been given a useless mine.

??	Are we doing some spy shit here?

??	No, some heroic journalist shit for my sister Pumla.

??	Six hours huh?

??	Ja.

??	Hello.

??	Miss Ndlovu...

??	Yes?

??	I know who murdered your sister...

??	What?

??	And I know why they killed her.

??	Who is this?
??	Not on the phone.

??	I'll text you the address, it's a bit of a drive.

??	Ah, hello?

??	Aluta Ndlovu.

??	You were there on the day my sister Pumla Ndlovu died, right?

??	Are you a police officer?

??	No.

??	Are you a detective?

??	No.

??	You said you know who killed her, right?

??	Yes I do.

??	Then speak, what are you doing?

??	It's me.

??	Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

??	Come here.

??	Let me go!

??	Listen, Drake said, I must remind you that you had other options.

??	Hello.

??	Here is proof that your boss is corrupt.

??	Pumla, no, what's wrong with you? Are you trying to ruin my career?

??	My sister, where is Mxolisi?

??	Mxolisi is not here yet. He's usually the first one here.

??	We tried calling him, but his phone goes straight to voicemail.

??	Okay, he was waiting for lab reports, did they come through?

??	Um, guys, any deliveries today for Mxolisi?

??	Sorry.

??	We need to go to the lab, now.

??	Hi, sir.

??	What do you want? We are looking for Ernest.

??	He works here.

??	Ernest is always late. Is it urgent?

??	Yes it is. We gave him coal samples to test. We came to check if he did it?

??	Coal sample test?

??	No. I didn't see any coal sample test.

??	Okay, how do we get the results?

??	The results?

??	You must wait for Ernest.

??	I'm glad you paid me up front.

??	Just ensure what we agreed on gets donated to my campaign Frank.

??	Power! To the people!

??	The country! To the people!

??	The land! Our land!

??	My people, I feel like ululating.

??	I feel like ululating. I don't even know what to do!

??	Because today, is the most important day.

??	The land and wealth is going back to who?

??	To us! It's going back to you!

??	The land is going back to you! It's yours!

??	Oh, no no. Yes?

??	What's going to happen today is...

??	What's going on? What's going on there my sister?

??	We also don't know. Let's continue.

??	My people today we are signing...Premier?

??	You should tell us what's going on.

??	Apparently Mkhuze mine has been mined out.

??	That's lies my people. That's how lies spread.

??	Mkhuze mine, is a very successful mine.

??	Like I said. What's going to happen... Premier?

??	Premier, why are you giving ownership of a useless mine to the people of Somkhele?

??	Mr. Drake! Mr. Drake!

??	Is it true that Pik Botha sold you the mine so that you can kill a struggle comrade? 

??	Is it true? Is it true?

??	Is this why you were willing to sell?

??	My people what we are supposed to do today.

??	Is to sign so the land can be returned to you. Stop the lies and fake news.

??	I posted that link. You'll see it now on social media.

??	Okay. Let's hope so.

??	Let's ignore the fake news and sign.

??	Let's sign and do what we came for.

??	Ignore the fake news, ignore the lies.

??	Stop right there. Don't sign.

??	Don't sign anything without seeing the original financials.

??	Demand that they show them to you!

??	This is how it's going to be...

??	Tomorrow you will tell the world, that everything you've been saying about me, is a lie.

??	All made up.

??	Your last chance Aluta.

??	No.

??	I'll start killing people you love.

??	You're a business man, you're not a psychopath.

??	Pumla doesn't think so.

??	Sergeant, I'm begging you.

??	I need to call home and let them know that I've been arrested.

??	I'm begging you.

??	Please.

??	Prisoner?

??	Here's a blanket.

??	Thank you.

??	There's just one thing.

??	You think this is your home?

??	Hey! Stop!

??	Hey! Where's Aluta? Huh?

??	Don't do that. I told you I don't know where she is...

??	Don't fool me. I said don't fool me. Where's Aluta?

??	Enough.

??	We'll take him.

??	You'll take me?

??	Where are you taking me? You're not the cops. That's nonsense.

??	We're taking you. You heard him right?

??	Okay, okay...

??	Hey, Ntshebe. Hey!

??	Who do you think you are, Ntshebe?

??	And in other news, Aluta Ndlovu, sister to the late Pumla Ndlovu is on the run from the police.

??	Just days after she helped her sister steal confidential files from Shift Inc.

??	It is alledged that three million rand has gone missing from the mine outreach program she was heading.

??	And here in studio, I have detective Viljoen who is heading the case. Welcome sir.

??	Thank you. Yes, It's true.

??	Aluta is a suspect, It is believed that she's involved in the death of these people.

??	Right now there are two people who were seen in her company, who now cannot be found.

??	She's the most beautiful flower in your garden.

??	She's the decorater of the world for she is a symbol of love.

??	For she is a symbol of peace.

??	For she is a symbol of unity.

??	If it wasn't for her, the word independant would not exist.

??	Oh great person on earth who gives birth to men, and yet she's been abused by them.

??	The one who still says our father who art in heaven and means every word of it.

??	The one who sacrifices sleep for she will...

??	We have two billion cash.

??	Well find the right person to bribe and put enough meat in their stew.

??	No more fucking excuses, you hear me! Do you hear me?

??	Sir. What?

??	The Premier has arrived.

??	Frank, the goverment wants It's money back.

??	I'm not giving their money back.

??	This is not the old administration, these people check everything, we have to just cancel this deal.

??	You run the party, make them do what you say.

??	It's not that easy Frank.

??	Or would you prefer them to know that you're an informer?

??	That you helped this sanctions buster...

??	Make a deal with the groot Krokodil...

??	To sell him Mkhuze mine in exchange for getting rid of Mr. Ndlovu and his very pretty wife.

??	No, no, I didn't help kill anyone.

??	You told me where they were.

??	You told me, that they had proof about what I was up to with Botha.

??	You knew they would die.

??	Don't play the Innocent lamb with me now.

??	Remember, It was a long time ago. We've done a hell of a lot for this country since then so...

??	The choice is yours.

??	Either your history plays on TV alongside Aluta Ndlovu who's telling the whole world...

??	That everything she said about me is fake news.

??	Or it doesn't.

??	You know that's right, Aluta will say that this is all bull.

??	That's life hey...

??	In the 's we're dealing with her dad, now we're dealing with her...

??	Cycles.

??	It's life.

??	Karma.

??	I need a scotch.

??	I have some very good scotch upstairs. But first I need to know that you and I...

??	We're good.

??	Fuck. What?

??	Nothing.

??	Let's get that scotch.

??	Who is it?

??	Hi Mama, are you the wife of Mr. Gumede?

??	No.

??	I'm begging you, I need to speak to him.

??	No, we saw the news, you're a criminal.

??	No, Mama, I didn't do any of those things.

??	Not at all. Please, I need to speak to him.

??	Listen here, we have our own problems in this house.

??	Right now my husband Winston is Ill because of you and your boss's mine.

??	You're also one of them.

??	My sister Pumla...

??	Was killed because of the mine.

??	Please help me.

??	Please, I'm begging you Mama, help me.

??	My wife...

??	Let her in.

??	Sit down my child.

??	You said I must alert you when she's back in the area.

??	I saw her.

??	Great job. I'll transfer your money very soon.

??	That'll be great sir.

??	Have you seen a doctor?

??	No, my child. There's a line at that clinic...

??	It's too long.

??	But, my husband, you need to learn to be patient.

??	My wife, If I don't go to the mine...

??	They wouldn't do a great job at all.

??	But, my husband...

??	Right now you're sick because of that mine.

??	Your lungs are full of the coal dust from the same mine.

??	My wife, come on.

??	Your boss, Drake...

??	And Premier Zwide will be here tomorrow.

??	To conclude the agreement and sign the deal.

??	Mr Gumede, this is just corruption.

??	As we speak people are dying.

??	They're killing anyone who might be in their way.

??	So...

??	Would you be able to speak to our community leaders face to face?

??	When?

??	Tomorrow I'll gather them.

??	You'll meet them here.

??	There's a woman who complimented me.

??	She's Xhosa.

??	She gave me compliments.

??	When she did, I felt like a man. A real man.

??	She said to me...

??	I was busy...

??	Giving it to her.

??	She said...

??	You're rude and disrespecting me.

??	She started by saying "Yoh" You know how they say "Yoh"?

??	You're disrespecting me.

??	She can't just say "Yoh"out of nowhere.

??	I mean, I was doing a great job.

??	Do you hear me, Ntshebe?

??	And then, she started speaking in tongues.

??	She's never had a premature ejaculation.

??	It was her first. Who did that? Me.

??	Yeah, yeah.

??	If you've never done that before you haven't really done this right.

??	This means...

??	I really gave it to her. She didn't even know what to say.

??	When she says I'm rude it means I'm very good.

??	You see?

??	You see, it was jaco-jusy.

??	It means the ejaculation was juicy.

??	You see?

??	Why did you hit me? What are you doing?

??	Why did you hit me? Did you have to hit me?

??	Did you really have to hit me? Why?

??	You had a phone all along?

??	You're hurting me. You're hurting me.

??	You're hurting me!

??	You don't know what the hands are used for?

??	Hey, man?

??	Who are you? Huh?

??	Huh?

??	Let's go. Move!

??	You see in this area.

??	In this area...

??	We know what to do with people like you.

??	Boys, teach him a lesson he'll never forget. Go!

??	Gumede should be back by now.

??	I warned him about going out at night.

??	No! They're burning Gumede's house.

??	Help! They're attacking us.

??	Ntshebe?

??	How many fingers are these?

??	From now on when you count you won't reach ten.

??	You'll stop at nine.

??	Watch her.

??	I'm just gonna go freshen up, and come fetch her.

??	Hey, brother?

??	Yeah runner? Brother?

??	Huh? Where did you think you'll end up? Huh?

??	Now that this bitch is here, you have an opinion? What do you say?

??	Did I ever tell you how ugly you are?

??	You're so ugly my brother...

??	You're ugly, you look like...

??	A monkey's bum.

??	That has diarrhea.

??	Oh, yeah?

??	You're very ugly, shame.

??	If there was a Mr. Ugly competition...

??	You'd be number one, two and three.

??	You're so ugly that even God...

??	The woman I slept with didn't scream like this.

??	"Bearded man" is down.

??	You see me bitch, I'm a die hard.

??	Hey? I'm a die hard bitch.

??	I'll be happy to blow your brains out.

??	Hack! Get up!

??	What makes us happy, as you can see is that...

??	As the government, when we promise to do something we do it.

??	There you go, we are signing today.

??	We do not agree. No! We are signing.

??	What's wrong, Mama?

??	We won't let you go through with this corrupt deal.

??	What's wrong, Mama? This woman is a liar.

??	She's telling lies.

??	The only person who told us the truth is Aluta Ndlovu.

??	Mama, Aluta Ndlovu is a hardcore criminal wanted by the police.

??	I'm sure you do watch the news.

??	Let's sign and get this over with.

??	Help! Help!

??	My husband believed her. I also believe her.

??	My husband Winston, is dead.

??	They killed him last night, but it's the same thing.

??	Even if they didn't kill him...

??	He was going to be killed by disease he contracted from your mine

??	These people don't care about us, or our lives.

??	They also don't care about our future.

??	Sign this!

??	Sign it now!

??	Sign it.

??	If there's no problem...

??	Tell this white man to allow the community to inspect the mine...

??	And see if there's still coal.

??	Mama? Mama? Mama?

??	Mama? Old lady, where have you seen a community inspecting a mine? Have you seen that?

??	That's a community decision, not yours.

??	Stop signing!

??	Don't sign!

??	Here she is! Speak my child.

??	Hi.

??	Aluta.

??	You tell them.

??	I'm here to tell you that...

??	What you've heard are lies.

??	All you heard about me are lies.

??	I've been running for my life.

??	Frank sent people to kill me.

??	Don't believe this!

??	Nomusa.

??	Are you involved in this corruption?

??	There's no corruption my child.

??	Have you paid him?

??	He hasn't been paid. No money has gone here.

??	We hacked his account and saw that they paid him already.

??	All of it.

??	Where's Nomusa?

??	Premiere Zwide is not available, I'm afraid.

??	Have you decided to confess?

??	Has Nomusa?

??	I think the most pressing question is, why are we here?

??	I know many of you personally...

??	I've helped many of you rise.

??	I've built most of the Durban waterfront.

??	Renewed Jozi’s inner city. I gentrified Cape Town.

??	I've worked with this government since it's birth, and South Africa has prospered...

??	But now my accounts are frozen, my businesses are hamstrung.

??	My empire is collapsing.

??	It will cost thousands of jobs...

??	Reduce billions from the economy, millions in tax.

??	Hurting me will damage South Africa irrevocably because I am its bones.

??	Now stop this. Drop the charges. Unfreeze my accounts. We all know, I was just doing business as usual.

??	I will donate anything required to maintain the status quo.

??	No.

??	I guess its time to emigrate.

??	Get the fuck out of here, all of you.

??	Now!

??	I'll be speaking at a press conference with Premier Zwide later today.

??	You do know that she's involved in this?

??	I don't understand what they say happened to the money.

??	That's all nonsense. Yes. I know that.

??	But we don't have concrete evidence.

??	Do you believe her? No, she's guilty.

??	Do you still have access to his accounts Hack?

??	Maybe we can find someting that can link her to what has happened.

??	You want us to continue with this?

??	After risking our lives, again?

??	Vashnia!

??	Vashnia! Come here.

??	Yes Frank?

??	How much money do you have?

??	Ten, maybe thirteen million, It's nothing Frank.

??	And if we put that into the currency markets.

??	Short the rand.

??	And the rand had to fall to, say thirty or thirtyfive against the dollar...

??	How much would we make?

??	Hundreds of millions.

??	Fine...

??	They want to take everything from me...

??	We'll take everyting they have.

??	We tank the rand.

??	How?

??	By bringing this country to it's knees.

??	Send my regards to your grandmother. How's Gogo Masibiya?

??	There you go.

??	We are happy for you Ma'm. We are happy for you.

??	Cook for the kids. And then you say we don't do anything for you? 

??	Frank, there's nothing I can do.

??	Not publicly, no. But you can provide me access.

??	Access to what?

??	Remember in ‘, right wing Afrikaners, the AWB wanted to make this country ungovernable.

??	They wanted to knock out  power stations and  sub-stations.

??	They were fools.

??	In more ways than one.

??	They thought that by taking down the grid...

??	They could take control of our land, but the thing is...

??	When a country's broken, no one takes control.

??	Chaos fills in the gaps.

??	The country falls apart and the only thing left to do is to leave.

??	But they were fools in another way.

??	They didn't need to knock out twenty two different places.

??	Two would suffice.
	
??	The national control room.

??	Which controls the national power grid.

??	and a hidden secondary control room that acts as a back up.

??	I need access to both.

??	Frank...

??	Do it.

??	Do it, and we're done.

??	I will never ask you anything again.

??	Don't and I will reveal the truth.

??	Frank...

??	If you blow up those power stations, you'll destroy South Africa completely.

??	South Africa, chose to destroy me!

??	Now...

??	You pony up, or the whole world knows you're an informer.

??	Hack, I'm not getting off the ride.

??	We are going to see this through to the end.

??	I knew you might say something like that.

??	Don't worry, I'm on it.

??	Have you found something?

??	Nothing.

??	He invested thirteen million rand.

??	He took all his remaining fortune to short the rand.

??	Short, short the rand?

??	What do you mean short the rand?

??	Frank is betting that the rand will fall.

??	And it's going to fall flat.

??	He stands to make hundreds of millions of rands.

??	No...

??	No, the rand will never fall like that.

??	South Africa's finally on the up again.

??	We'll never know since he's friends with someone who wants to be president

??	Anything can happen, they can make a lot of money, I'm telling you.

??	Thank you very much my sister for that question.

??	Another question please.

??	What is the relationship between you and Frank Drake?

??	My sister, I'm here to talk about the elections. I made that very clear.

??	Let's please talk about elections and about...

??	We will leave it there for now.

??	Vashnia will have to gain access through the front door of the power station.

??	You'll have to go through the sewers to the secondary.

??	No Frank, no, your fingerprints, your retinal scans, now don't call me again.

??	You have to do this yourself.

??	What does Frank want?

??	Hey, Mama?

??	Talk!

??	Frank was a... He was a...

??	He was a sanctions buster in the eighties in this country...

??	He used to smuggle coal in and out of the country.

??	In the eighties.

??	Frank Drake, speak, speak!

??	Yes! Frank Drake! What did he do? Talk!

??	I was in MK and I was in serious debt.

??	I was in serious debt.

??	And then, Pik Botha

??	Sold the mine to Frank.

??	Frank had to find the man with the proof of the sanction busting.

??	The man with the proof was your father.

??	I let your father down.

??	What does Frank Drake want from you right now?

??	What does he want now? Right now, what does he want?

??	That's why I do what he wants me to do.

??	That's why I do what he wants me to do.

??	Hi. Hi.

??	How are you? Good.

??	Hi everyone. Hey.

??	Hello. Hi, how are you?

??	Good, um, I just have some documents for Mr. Fouché to sign.

??	Vashnia's made it into the primary control room.

??	Mnatha, you first.

??	We do what is needed.

??	I still don't think you should be here.

??	Well, I'm the only one who can get us through the back door, past the scanners.

??	Besides...

??	Sometimes you've got to do shit yourself.

??	Let's go.

??	If you could please just fill out, the forms on this side very quickly for me.

??	Thank you.

??	It's done.

??	Let's his this thing and get the hell out of here.

??	I should have never taught you to shoot.

??	Frank.

??	Thank God you're here, arrest this woman she tried to kill me.

??	We're not here for her.

??	Nomusa confessed, and you know what? We will fix the power.

??	Arrest this man.

??	I could have made you so powerful...

??	I'll make myself powerful.

??	Our people are shocked that Premier Zwide sold them out.

??	I'm sorry.

??	I get it now.

??	I can't run from this forever.

??	I've been chasing money.

??	There are more important things worth fighting for.

??	And I promise you.

??	I'll never stop fighting.

??	Excuse me?

??	Aren't you Aluta Ndlovu?

??	The superhero?

??	Aren't you "Four finger Hack?"

??	But I can still shoot.

??	I've been thinking.

??	I don't know if maybe.

??	Wait, wait, wait. If...

??	I was thinking about exactly this...

??	Let's go.
