NOLA	Who the fuck is Onyx?

MARS	Never heard of him.

NOLA	In Seventh Grade I woke up one morning and these Tiny Mounds were occupying my chest, I pinched, I poked but they wouldn’t go away. Overnight, just like that, Life was complicated by a quarter pound of flesh. These. In school I was tormented, okay teased, by Rashaad Decker, a horny little Punk half my size but his words cut like a Knife. I mean he could read me Raw in seconds and make me Feel Naked and ashamed of my Body in front of the entire Class. The Humiliation was like a dark Keloid growing around a wound. And everyday I would go Home in Tears and everyday my Moms would say.

SEPTIMA	“Face him down Nola, Words can’t hurt you, don’t give him your Power.”

NOLA	And of course I know that, I mean I get it,  I’m not Fuckin’ dense. But Today, I have something to say to Rashaad and all those other bitches. Watch the fuck out! 

NOLA	I feel Sick.

MARS	Hey. Hey. Hey. Nola. Nola. Nola!

NOLA	What?!

MARS	Don’ worry. I’ma find out who did this? Trust me, I got my ways, Ways I got my. Aight? Aight? Aight?

NOLA	AIGHT! But, keep my name out your mouth, okay? I don't want it out there like that and Ihope you find him before I do! ‘Cuz you got one thing right. This IS WAR. Just...

MARS	I got you.

DR.JAMISON	Do I have to give up an essential part of my self-expression in order to survive? That’s Nola’s question. I don’t discuss my Patients but I’m not violating her confidentiality if say that... well, My first impressions of Nola Darling? Insatiable, and yet I sense a fragile but vibrant Spirit just hovering beneath all that Self-Protective Armor. She’s juggling a lot. Men. Ambitions. Emotions. 

DR. JAMISON	I’m glad you you’re here. Let’s talk a little about what you want to accomplish.

NOLA	I want to...

DR. JAMISON	... Breathe. You’re carrying a lot of tension in your Face. Just take a couple deep breaths. It’s natural to be angry. You were attacked, not just once but twice. First your Body, then your Art. What happened to you is unacceptable and it’s not your fault. So let's just let go of that.

NOLA	I...

DR. JAMISON	Yes?

NOLA	...Feel violated. Anxious, like I want to cover up and hide, even from the Men in my life.

DR. JAMISON	Okay. So, tell me about the Men in your life.

NOLA	Oh God, where to start? They’re all really different, they feed me in distinct ways, but sometimes I feel like they’re all threatened by my Sexuality. And I’m sick of feeling like I have to make decisions based on the Male gaze. I'm use to knowing what I want in Relationships and in my Art, but lately I’m just, I'm so Confused.

DR. JAMISON	When you’ve been through some sort of trauma, it’s easy to feel like you’re losing control of your Life. But talking about it is one way that we start to take back that control. But, here’s something to think about, you can wear full Purdah, show only your Eyes and Men will still harass you. The solution isn’t covering up, it's... it's... it's finding a way to assert your Power and to move through the World with Confidence. And we can work on that! But for now, I want you to do something that brings you Joy. Exercise, wear something that makes you feel Confident or... try something new. Something that makes you Feel Good. Don’t let fear dictate your choices. And don’t forget to Breathe.


NOLA	I thought Fort Green had a lot of strollers.

ELLIE	Hello.

NOLA	Hi.

ELLIE	Can I help you guys find anything?

NOLA	Nope. Just looking.

CLORINDA	Pretty!

NOLA	Ooohh, all black. Thanks for coming through.

CLORINDA	Girl you know me, you don’t need to convince me to shop.

NOLA	Don’t you have something to fold or...?

ELLIE	I'm just trying to be helpful. The changing room is in the back.

NOLA	Ooh, I love this colour.

CLORINDA	Nice.

NOLA	Right? So... I took your advice and started seeing Doc Jamison.

CLORINDA	Good! And? No. So?

NOLA	I mean it was great. She really helped redirect my energy. And today, I just want to go shopping and forget about all the crazy shit that's been happening.

CLORINDA	Word. This place is cute.

ELLIE	Thank you.

NOLA	What about this one?

CLORINDA	The suspense is killing me.

NOLA	What do you think?

CLORINDA	Too much drama.

NOLA	I'm channeling Eartha Kitt.

CLORINDA	What is that?

NOLA	First trimester?

CLORINDA	Of a kangaroo. Next. Wow.

NOLA	Bang!

CLORINDA	Damn.

NOLA	I think I'm gonna get.

ELLIE	Your total is... five hundred and fifty-eight dollars and seventy-two cents (558.72), with tax.

CLORINDA	558.72? With.. with tax? It's with taxes, excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus Christ, You can hardly afford your Rent.

NOLA	I can’t explain it Clo, but I need this Dress.

CLORINDA	But you’re too impulsive and it's probably why you keep getting yourself into trouble.

NOLA	Are you saying it’s my fault I got Assaulted?

CLORINDA	No, I'm just saying that Dress is ...

NOLA	No, no. Men need to grow up, if they can’t deal with me in a little Black Dress then Fuck’em’.

CLORINDA	Whatever. I’m just saying this Dress is too expensive.

ELLIE	How would you like to pay for this?

NOLA	Split it three ways, please!

JAMIE	Glad my driver got you here safely. Damn! I thought a nice Dinner might cheer you up. And I’ve been dying to see you. Come on.

WOMAN	Welcome to the river cafe, please come in.

NOLA	Thank you. This place is Live.

JAMIE	What’s Live is that Black Dress, and I can’t wait to get you out of it. 

SANTO	Welcome Mr. Overstreet.

JAMIE	Thank you.

SANTO	Let me take you to your table. Follow me please.

JAIME	That dress.

NOLA	What’s wrong?

JAMIE	I mentioned it was a Business casual vibe.

NOLA	A little variation on the Theme.

JAMIE	Don’t get me wrong, I Love your BLACK Dress, but god damn.

NOLA	...What?

JAMIE	This ain't exactly a Nightclub in Miami. If you know what I’m saying?

SANTO	Madame, may I take your coat?
 
NOLA	Yes. Thanks.

SANTO	The waiter will come with menus. Enjoy.

NOLA	Thank you.

JAMIE	And maybe it’s a little Chilly in here.

NOLA	Thanks.

JAMIE	Look, Nola, I’m sorry I’ve been so Crazy. I’m just not used to hanging around in the waiting room with other Dudes, if you know what I'm saying? I think I’ve been clear about how I Feel about You.

NOLA	You have, and so have I. Mr. Jamie Overstreet, I’m here with you right now, okay? It's just you, me, and this kick ass view.

NOLA	What’s this?

JAMIE	A gift. CITIZEN by Claudia Rankine. I love it! And I want someone to talk to about it. Truth is I don’t really have many People in my circle who I think will get it.

NOLA	Are you clairvoyant? I’ve been meaning to read this. 

JAIME	Well good.
NOLA	You’re a complicated puzzle. Aren’t you?

JAMIE	I like your curiosity.

NOLA	I like yours too.

JAMIE	Is that right? I don’t see enough of you, Nola Darling. How can we fix that?

NOLA	Terms of Endearment.

JAMIE	Look, I understand what you’re asking and I’m trying to take care of my Home situation.

NOLA	No, I'm sorry. I was just thinking of classic cinematic moments that were shot at the River Cafe.  “Terms of Endearment”, directed by James L. Brooks? Ah, it had Shirley McClaine, Jack Nicholson and what is her name, um, Deborah Winger.

JAMIE	Nah, I... I haven't seen it.

NOLA	Oh Jamie you’ve gotta see it.

JAMIE	I didn’t get to see a lot of old Films growing up. In my House, it was Cable TV or Clothing, couldn’t afford both. Let’s talk about why you always change the Subject when I ask you a serious Question?

NOLA	Do I?

JAMIE	Yeah

NOLA	I’m sorry. Well shit, what was the Question?

JAMIE	Yeah, what was the question?

NOLA	You’re so Serious. No, I love it. Everyone I know is like in between places, and you’re already there. Makes me wanna be there with you.

JAMIE	Well, maybe next May I should take you with me to Cannes.

NOLA	You know, you can’t just throw that out there like that. Now, I expect to go.

JAMIE	I’m a Man of my Word, Nola.

NOLA	Really?
 
JAMIE	Yeah.

NOLA	And your Wife, what about her word?

JAMIE	Not fair.

NOLA	Right, it’s “Complicated.”

JAMIE	I’ve told you we’re separated. It’s just a matter of some Papers, that’s all. 

USMAN	Pardon me, we have the two-thousand and three (2003) Kreug, for you.

JAMIE	We didn’t order that.

USMAN	Oh this is from the Gentlemen over by the bar.

PHIL	Hey!

DON	Jamie!

NOLA	Who are they?

JAMIE	Those are my partners from Overstreet Investment. That's Phil and Don.
NOLA	Hi! Should we invite them over?

JAMIE	No, no, no! They will only bore you. Thank you.

USMAN	You're welcome, Sir.

NOLA	How come I haven't met any of your Friends?

JAMIE	You’ve never asked.

NOLA	I shouldn't have to. I’m all for keeping it casual, but I do not want to be your Secret. 

JAMIE	What are you talking about? You’re not. You're not! To cinema.

JAMIE	Wait here. You just wait right here.

NOLA	It's the Batmobile.

JAMIE	Wow, slow down buddy. Watch your step.

NOLA	You should watch you step.

JAMIE	I got you.

NOLA	Do you?

JAMIE	Can I come up? That Black Dress has been speaking to me all evening.

NOLA	What's it been saying?

JAMIE	You want me to spell it out? S.E.X.

NOLA	Ah, so now you like my Black Dress?

JAMIE	True that.

NOLA	Mmmhmm. That’s not the impression I got at The River Cafe.

JAMIE	I love your Dress. I told you that. I was feelin’ a Lil’...Protective.

NOLA	Well, I don’t appreciate the Cognitive Dissonance.

JAMIE	Well, I’m sorry. It’s not a Big Deal.

NOLA	It is to me. It Hurt my Feelings.

JAMIE	Okay, now I know. So can I come up? You know, honestly, Nola, if you don’t want the attention, you shouldn’t be wearin’ this Black Dress.

NOLA	Excuse me?

JAMIE	I mean...

NOLA	 Good night, Jamie.

JAMIE	Good Night?!

NOLA	Yup!

JAMIE	Nola.

NOLA	Goodnight. You know you've done fucked, don't you?
