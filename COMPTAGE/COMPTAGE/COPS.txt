MICHAEL	You know it's a bad idea to kill a cop, right?
MICHAEL	Maybe I underestimated you...
MICHAEL	...but it's time to take you in.
JESSIE	So that's how you see this ending, huh?
OFFICER	Put the gun down!
JESSIE	Says the guy staring down the barrel of mine.
MICHAEL	They've given me one minute to reason with you.
JESSIE	They're way out there, they ain't saving you.
MICHAEL	I'm not the one who needs saving. Or do you plan on dying in here?
JESSIE	I've been ready for that ever since I stepped into that bank. Question is, are you?
MICHAEL	How long are we going to do this? Huh? It's over!
JESSIE	Your boys out there look antsy.
JESSIE	They want some more of my blood?
MICHAEL	Tell me where to look!
JESSIE	I honestly don't have a clue.
MICHAEL	I'm done playing with you.
JESSIE	Finally something we both can agree on.
CONNIE	Hey.
MICHAEL	Hey, hey.
CONNIE	Are you nervous?
MICHAEL	Anxious is a better word.
CONNIE	Coffee was a smart choice then. You want some breakfast?
MICHAEL	You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you're trying to keep me here.
CONNIE	No one says you have to go back today.
MICHAEL	Looks like I'm not the nervous one.
MICHAEL	I'll tell you what? Try thinking  about where you'd like to goonce we get our boat.
CONNIE	And you try thinking about getting through today first.
MICHAEL	Hey, Gary.
JOHN DOE	You fucking bitch!
MICHAEL	Hey, so, where are you off to so early?
CHERYL	Well, I've got a jumper.
MICHAEL	Ah, need me to come with?
CHERYL	On your first day back? You need to take it slow.
MICHAEL	Questioning my judgment already, huh?
CHERYL	Look, I took it easy on you. Any other therapist would have spent years treating you.
MICHAEL	Well, thank God I'm done with all that therapy.
CHERYL	You know I can see through 	your B.S., right?
MICHAEL	What? I'm fine.
CHERYL	You don't always have to put up your guard with me. Look, I'm just saying... I'm here too.
MICHAEL	It's appreciated.
CHERYL	Well, better get in there, Randolph is waiting to make it official.
MICHAEL	Ah, let him wait.
CHERYL	All right, well, don't make any lunch plans. I'm gonna call you when this is over.
MICHAEL	Hm... hey, Doc, thanks for letting me prote t and serve again.
CHERYL	You know, I'm not your doctoranymore.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	You look rested.
MICHAEL	Time off will do that.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Yeah. And Connie?
MICHAEL	She needed me to figure out a few things, so I did. Never too easy living with a cop, right?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Oh, yeah, hah-hah, Amen to that. Then I guess it is a good thing you got all that rest.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	I know you're not happy about the way things went down, but the past is the past.
MICHAEL	Easier said when you weren't the department's punching bag. 
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	I did all I could do. Now I hope we're past all that now.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Welcome home.
JACOBS	Look who's back.
SHAKERS	Did you lose some weight?
MILLER	He looks fatter to me.
MICHAEL	You guys got something you want to get off your little chests?
JACOBS	It's not our place... that's Cap's call.
NICHOLSON	I just didn't expect to see you back in the saddle so soon.
MICHAEL	Well, I am. So catch me up.
JACOBS	We've had a flurry of meth traffic on the north side. Plus a few-
MILLER	Hold on, give it a break, Jacobs. This is not the pressing issue at hand.
MILLER	What we need to know is how you could spend six months alone with Connie?
SHAKERS	Oh, she drive you crazy or what? 
MILLER	Staring at my wife that long would send me over the top.
SHAKERS	That's probably why you're divorced.
MILLER	Well, I'd gladly take another bullet before I'd ever get married again.
SHAKERS	Oh, Jesus, how many times do we gotta hear 'the story?'
MICHAEL	And that bullet barely grazed you.
NICHOLSON	So, Mike, where did you guys go on vacation? Mexico, you do 	some salsa?
MICHAEL	You know, it's technically not a vacation when the department forces you to go on one, right?
NICHOLSON	Shit, sorry.
MICHAEL	Rookies.
MILLER	Trusting an old cop will get you killed quicker than any felon.
MICHAEL	How many days you got left?
MILLER	Twenty one and counting. Last trip to the bank for the department.
JACOBS	How much do we have in the pension?
MILLER	Little over five million.
NICHOLSON	Shit. I got like  years til I see my checks.
MICHAEL	Hey, don't worry about that, it'll be long gone before then.
NICHOLSON	What?
JACOBS	He's kidding.
NICHOLSON	Oh.
MILLER	Well, you've been back for an hour and already Connie is keeping tabs.
MILLER	Have a good day, sweetie.
MILLER	Need some help with that?
RANDY	Nah... it's just a dirty plug.
MILLER	Always something with these old clunkers. Good luck.
BECKETT	You decide where you're going? Me... I'd go somewhere warm, Hawaii.
MILLER	As long as I retire far away from here, I'm sitting pretty.
RANDY	Move! Move! You! Get over 	there!
JESSIE	Everybody listen up! Somebody been robbing you for years... and it ain't been us.
JESSIE	Give me your undivided attention and you will live to see justice served.
JESSE	Now the choice is yours, but it'll be the only one you'll get today. Cage key.
JESSIE	Let me help you out with that.
BECKETT	Are you insane? 
ARNIE	What the fuck is that? Deliveries only come on Friday.
BECKETT	It's just a pick up, it's no big deal.
JESSIE	Now we both know that's a lie.
ARNIE	What are you doing, man?
JESSE	Let him in.
BECKETT	The alarm... they'll be here any minute.
JESSIE	Tick-tock, let's go. Move it!
ARMORED GUARD #	You ready for us?
JESSIE	Yes, I am.
JESSE	Don't make me tell you again.
ARNIE	Get over there, let's go.
ARNIE	Let's go, let's go!
SECURITY GUARD #	Take it easy!
ARNIE	Move, man! Hey, a bullet's real easy. Open the door and get in there. Don't do anything stupid, you might live, all right?
RANDY	Okay, we got it, we're good to go!
JESSIE	No.
CRAIG	The fuck you mean 'no?'
ARNIE	We got the dough, man. It's time to split.
JESSIE	I said no!
JESSE	I'm not here for the money.
ARNIE	What are you doing, man?
CRAIG	Yeah, this ain't the plan, man.
JESSIE	Yeah, it is. You just didn't know it until right now.
ARNIE	You said, in and out.
JESSIE	I lied.
RANDY	Hey, you know what? If he wants to stay, fuck him, that's on him. I'm out of here.
CRAIG	No, no, no, no, no, fuck that, because if he gets caught, they draggin' all of us across the pavement.
JESSIE	Two minutes. That's all I need with Mr. Manager here.
ARNIE	This is fucked.
CRAIG	I mean, goddamn, man! Shit!
OFFICER BANKS	You won't tell us your name, then how about your girlfriend's?
CHERYL	So what happened between you guys? Let's figure this out.
JOHN DOE	I'm not telling you shit.
CHERYL	I just want to resolve this, sir.
JOHN DOE	I'm not here for therapy. Get the fuck away from me!
MICHAEL	Robbery, homicide.
CHERYL	So, we might need a rain check on lunch.
MICHAEL	I take it the jumper was serious?
CHERYL	Yeah. How'd it go with Randolph?
MICHAEL	About as well as expected.
CHERYL	That bad?
MICHAEL	Yeah, he's always hated the fact that I was his best negotiator.
JACOBS	We got a - at First Savings Bank.
MICHAEL	Wait... Miller's at that bank.
BECKETT	I don't understand. You got all the money anyway. And the police are probably outside.
JESSIE	Don't worry about that, homeboy. You need to worry about finding me something valuable. Over there.
JESSE	Down. Down!
BECKETT	I swear the guards only came in for some paperwork.
JESSIE	Open up! Open! Open up!
JESSE	You know something? I believe you.
ARNIE	Where the fuck is everybody?
ARNIE	Where the hell is everybody?
JESSIE	Looks like we gonna have to make a run for it.
JACOBS	Target acquired.
MICHAEL	Rubber. So much for the element of surprise. Get EMT down here!
AL	Yo, man, I'm just a bank guard. They made me run out of here.
MICHAEL	What's your name? 
AL	Al.
MICHAEL	Al, how many men are robbing that bank?
AL	Four guys in this get up. And their leader is one crazy son of a bitch.
MICHAEL	Can you give us a description?
AL	Yeah, they're the ones with the masks and the guns. And one of them pistol whipped my ass.
MICHAEL	Get him out of here.
NICHOLSON	Michael, we got their vehicle, it's a stolen van, right over there.
MICHAEL	Have it dusted, maybe we'll get lucky and find out who this crazy son of a bitch is.
ADAMS	Got it.
NICHOLSON	Copy.
RANDY	Let me ask you something, since you cut all the alarms, how the fuck were the cops called?
CRAIG	I'll tell you how...
JESSIE	Your guns have blanks. Mine don't.
ARNIE	Chill, man, okay?
JESSIE	We're still getting out of here. Just need y'all to help me open some eyes first. Or we could part ways now?
ARNIE	Just relax. We're all here, let's work it out! What do you say, huh?
JESSIE	These are real. Do we have a deal?
ARNIE	You're the boss. Shit, man, you came prepared for more than I was thinking. It's like you planned on us getting jammed up.
JESSIE	It's the only way I could get their attention.
SHAKERS	That sounded like real gunfire.
MICHAEL	We don't know what that was. Secure the area first.
ADAMS	The van was wiped clean.
MICHAEL	So crazy, not stupid.
ADAMS	That's your department.
NICHOLSON	Hey, what the hell are they doing?
MICHAEL	Human barricades.
MICHAEL	All units, those are the hostages, do not fire until I give the order.
SHAKERS	Al, our crack bank guard over there, said there's three more employees, but didn't know about the customers. Bank's camera's been disabled.
SHAKERS	You picked a hell of a day to come back, Mike.
RANDY	This plan of yours had better fucking work.
JESSIE	Trust me, it's a good deal, you three get to keep all the money.
ARNIE	How are we ever gonna spend it, if we gotta go to war with the cops?
JESSIE	Don't worry about them, the key is getting out before the Feds arrive.
ARNIE	That's the cops.
JESSE	Ssh.
MICHAEL	Anybody by the phone?
SHAKERS	I don't know, I can't see shit with those hostages in the way.
MICHAEL	Shit.
JACOBS	You think Miller is still alive?
SHAKERS	Hey, shut your mouth! He's fine.
MICHAEL	Hey, hey, hey, stop, hey! Head's in the game, okay? Nobody's dying on my watch. You got that?
ARNIE	It stopped ringing. Maybe SWAT's on the way.
JESSIE	Man, SWAT ain't here yet, they're coming from Henderson.
MICHAEL	This is Michael Johnson, who am I speaking with?
JESSIE	Hello, little brother.
MICHAEL	Jessie? Is that you?
JESSIE	Who else would it be?
MICHAEL	Jessie Sampson, D.O.B. --. That's right, he wasn't lying.
JESSIE	I wasn't sure you would remember me.
MICHAEL	Well, just surprised to hear your voice. I didn't know you were back in town.
JESSIE	Nothing like home sweet home.
MICHAEL	Is everyone safe in there?
JESSIE	Look, don't start that negotiator bullshit with me, we're family. You talk to me like I actually matter first.
MICHAEL	Okay, okay, Jessie. Take it easy.
MICHAEL	Bank guard was right about him.
JACOBS	I'll get an ETA from SWAT.
JESSIE	Tell those snipers not to get all trigger happy. We wouldn't want an innocent man dying on your watch.
MICHAEL	Okay, Jessie, now I know those people inside would love to go home.
JESSIE	You trying to say I'm not good company?
MICHAEL	Hey, I don't know, I haven't seen you in quite awhile.
JESSIE	And whose fault is that?
MICHAEL	You know it's never a good idea for a cop to visit a prisoner.
JESSIE	Yes, but who put me in that cage?
MICHAEL	One day maybe you'll own up to your mistakes.
JESSIE	Like you did? Because... I never saw you rotting in a cell.
MICHAEL	Trying to humiliate me will not change your situation.
JESSIE	Hm, it was always easy getting to you. Like when we was kids.
MICHAEL	But this is not kid's stuff.
MICHAEL	You called the news?
JESSIE	It ain't real, if it ain't on TV.	
MICHAEL	Look, let those people go and we can spend all day catching up.
JESSIE	You mean fix our relationship?
JESSIE	Here's how I see this going...
JESSE	you put me in jail once, little brother, let's see you try that shit again.
JESSIE	Come and fucking get me!
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Hey! This asshole is your brother?
MICHAEL	Yeah, I changed my last name after we split up as kids.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Jesus! I'm putting Shakers on this.
MICHAEL	Wait, what?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	I have to pull you, you're family. You know the playbook. I can't have you anywhere near this.
MICHAEL	What about the Feds?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	They're at least five hours away.
SHAKERS	Michael, don't worry, I got this.
MICHAEL	You don't know my brother, this shit is all just a game to him.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	The only thing I'm worried about is getting everybody in that bank out alive.
MICHAEL	Well, maybe I could just listen in, strictly as an advisor.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Maybe not, you need to go.
MICHAEL	Okay, I got it. Cause I'm sure you'd hate to send me on another vacation, right?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Come here.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	You still know how to take orders? Huh?
MICHAEL	Yeah.
CAPTAIN RUDOLPH	Get the fuck out of here now!
SWAT LEADER	Go, go, go!
BECKETT	Come on, please, you gotta let us go--
JESSIE	Shut up!
JESSE	Everybody up! Get up! Put your hands in the air. Let's see if anybody got anything useful on them.
JESSIE	You folks are lucky, in jail they strip you naked. They inspect your hair, stick their fingers in your mouth, they even inspect your genitals. It's not a pleasant experience.
JESSIE	The penal system, they take your clothes and then your dignity. Do you wanna know why?
JESSIE	Do only as you're told, like you're some dog. After being locked up so long, do you know what I've come to learn?
JESSIE	I fucking hate cops.
CRAIG	Oh, shit.
JESSIE	I bet this pig wishes he used a different bank.
JESSIE	Boys, we just hit the hostage lottery.
JESSIE	Michael, thanks for the gift.
SHAKERS	You're not dealing with Michael any longer. This is Detective Shakers. 
JESSIE	Who in the fuck put you in charge?
SHAKERS	I'm senior detective.
JESSIE	You think you're calling the shots? Let's get one thing straight. I'll only talk to my brother.
SHAKERS	I'm afraid we can't allow that. It's against policy.
JESSIE	Well, then I'll force you to rethink your policy.
SHAKERS	Snipers, do we have a shot? SNIPERNegative. He's too close to Miller.
SHAKERS	Michael!
MICHAEL	What happened?
SHAKERS	He said he'd only deal with you.
JACOBS	I say we send in SWAT now.
MICHAEL	No, those gung-ho assholes only go in if I can't do my job!
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	It's Michael's show now.
JESSIE	Watch the doors.
ARNIE	What about the cops?
JESSIE	They ain't coming in now that we got their boy.
JESSIE	Hey! Don't answer that. Let my brother's imagination run wild.
MILLER	I didn't know Michael had a brother.
JESSIE	Man, you trying to reason with me? Well, I come from a place where that shit don't fucking exist.
MILLER	This is not a smart decision.
JESSIE	You haven't been paying attention, huh? I don't make these kind of decisions.
MILLER	They're never gonna let you out of here if you take this any further.
JESSIE	Right, because your life is worth more than all of those hostages?
MILLER	Don't twist my words to fit your sick justifications.
JESSIE	It ain't me, homey, this world is a cruel place... especially with me in it.
MILLER	Every move you make, they're gonna be ready for it ten times over. Being in here, it's like you're already back in prison.
JESSIE	Except for in prison I never had the pleasure of doing this.
JESSIE	Don't pass out on me yet, cop, you still got plenty of blood left.
MICHAEL	He makes me come back just to go silent on us?
MICHAEL	Anyone got eyes on Miller?
SNIPER #	Negative.
SHAKERS	Michael, this is the guy from the electric company, he wants to take his truck back.
MICHAEL	Okay, now don't look up. Anyway you can re-attach those wires on that post, so I can get a look inside?
ELECTRIC WORKER	I could try.
MICHAEL	Okay, do it.
SHAKERS	Come on, come on, come on.
MICHAEL	He looked up, didn't he?
JACOBS	Sure did.
MICHAEL	Yeah.
JESSIE	Hey, man, I know how you're feeling. I've had my share of ass-whoopings, too. First, it's the pain, then you wish it was over.
JESSE	But soon, you're gonna wish that it was all over.
JESSIE	Saved by the bell.
JESSE	Not a good time, bro.
MICHAEL	Where's Miller?
JESSIE	He's right here, spilling his guts out.
MICHAEL	That window stunt of yours has everybody out here gunning for you. I need to know Miller is okay, right now.
JESSIE	Or what?
MICHAEL	Oh, you can figure out the "or what?"
JESSIE	Listen, man, you need to tell your people to chill the fuck out. I still need time to come up with my list of demands.
MICHAEL	Are you joking?
JESSIE	Mike, I don't joke about time. Probably because I missed out on so much of it. Well, the good parts at least.
JESSE	High school, prom, finding a  wife, buying my piece of the American dream. I bet you don't even remember the date. I'll never forget March th, .
YOUNG JESSIE	Freeze.
YOUNG MICHAEL	Missed me.
YOUNG JESSIE	No way, I got you.
YOUNG MICHAEL	I didn't feel it.
YOUNG MICHAEL	Jessie? I don't wanna play anymore.
YOUNG JESSIE	Bang! Gotcha! Your big brother wins again. Cops always catch the bad guys.
YOUNG MICHAEL	Hey! You won't always be bigger than me.
YOUNG JESSIE	Yes, I will. Just like Dad will always be bigger than us.
YOUNG MICHAEL	Can we go home now?
YOUNG JESSIE	Don't be such a baby, man, come on!
YOUNG MICHAEL	Why are the cops at our house?
YOUNG JESSIE	Those guys work at Dad's station, don't worry.
YOUNG MICHAEL	Hold up, stay here.
YOUNG MICHAEL	Why can't I come?
YOUNG JESSIE	Because I have to get the guns back before Dad finds out. All right? All right.
MARCUS	So how much you idiots take? This cash, it's supposed to shut me up?
DAVID	Be reasonable, Marcus.
MARCUS	Fuck you. You should have thought about that before you started your little side business.
STEVEN	You're putting us in a really awful position here.
MARCUS	Nah, nah, that's on you, okay? I'm just the guy that gets to blow it all up.
MARCUS	Next time you hit a cop, you should do it to his face.
STEVEN	No! Calm down!
MARCUS	Like that.
STEVEN	Calm down. I think we can still figure this out.
STEVEN	No!
STEVEN	Fuck! He's dead.
DAVID	He was gonna blow the lid.
STEVEN	What the fuck are we supposed to do now?
DAVID	Did you clear the damn bedroom?
STEVEN	Jesus... it's his kid.
DAVID	Who saw the whole thing.
STEVEN	How are we gonna explain this with a goddamn witness?
DAVID	Who heard the entire conversation.
STEVEN	You want to bust a kid? For what?
YOUNG JESSE	Stop!
DAVID	Shots fired. Officer down. We need an ambulance now.
DAVID	He grabbed for my gun. He shot his dad. Got it?
YOUNG JESSIE	I didn't do nothing!
DAVID	Shut the fuck up.
YOUNG JESSE	Leave me alone!
YOUNG JESSIE	Michael!
YOUNG JESSE	Michael, please!
DAVID	Nobody's out there. And even if they were, nobody can save you from where you're headed.
JESSIE	I went to the darkest place a kid could go. And you kept me there.
MILLER	You know you're one--
JESSIE	I decide when you get to speak!
JESSE	Because you were too chicken shit. All you had to do was speak up.
MICHAEL	I was only a kid.
JESSIE	So was I.
MICHAEL	Two cops saw you shoot our father. What was I supposed to think?
JESSIE	You should have believed your brother.
MICHAEL	Hey! You don't know every goddamn thing. I had a hard road, too.
JESSIE	You're comparing our lives now?
MICHAEL	Quit stalling. I want those people out of there and I want them out now.
JESSIE	These things take time. I'm making my list, I'm checking it twice.
MICHAEL	Well, you better decide quick. Pretty soon it's gonna be out of my hands.
JESSIE	Uh-huh, those SWAT boys never could hold their wads.
MICHAEL	All right, look, well, you gotta give me something. Send Miller out, it'll go a long way.
JESSIE	I don't think he's up for it. How about a teller instead? 
JACOBS	Stay behind me, stay behind me.
JANE	Hi.
MICHAEL	Have a seat, have a seat. Are you injured?
JANE	No, they never touched me.
MICHAEL	Okay, good. All right, now how many of them were there?
JANE	There's four, and they came in, it was really, really fast and--
MICHAEL	All right, now there's a police officer inside. Do you know where they took him?
JANE	You mean Mr. Miller?
MICHAEL	Yeah.
JANE	Yeah, they-- one of them dragged him into the vault and we could hear them punching him over and over again.
MICHAEL	Did you hear anything else?
JANE	No, but they hit our manager, Mr. Beckett. He hit him with his gun.
MICHAEL	And how's he doing?
JANE	He's alive, but he wasn't really moving.
MICHAEL	Now was there anyone else injured?
JANE	No, but everyone is really scared. That guy is completely crazy.
MICHAEL	Okay, we're gonna have the EMT's check you out just to make sure, okay?
MICHAEL	What?
JESSIE	My turn to get a sign of good faith.
MICHAEL	All right, what do you want?
JESSIE	Your SWAT van will do.
MICHAEL	Never gonna happen. How about I get you a nice KIA and you send out the rest of the hostages?
JESSIE	Look, I did my part, now I want that van.
MICHAEL	Okay, look, I'm going to make this real simple. You may have the hostages, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm in charge. See, I hold all the cards. Now that's something we normally wouldn't tell the rest of the public, but that's the way it is. Now you hurt anybody else and we're gonna storm that bank, you got me?
JESSIE	Is this how you handled your last incident?
MICHAEL	No, no, no, stay on point with me. Now what else can I trade you for the hostages?
JESSIE	I told you what I wanted.
MICHAEL	And I told you no.
JESSIE	Well, the only other thing I could possibly want to discuss is your 'incident.'
MICHAEL	Why? You obviously know all about it.
JESSIE	True, true. It made the news. I saw his wife on TV. Man, she looked crushed.
MICHAEL	If I talk to you about this, will you send out another hostage?
JESSIE	Now we're getting somewhere.
MICHAEL	What do you want to know?
JESSIE	Why did SWAT open fire?
MICHAEL	Are you looking for hints on my next move?
JESSIE	I don't need any help to beat you, I just simply want to know 'why?'
MICHAEL	Okay, we thought the suspect was armed and SWAT heard shots.
MICHAEL	What do we got?
LATINO MAN	Tell those pigs, I'll never pay them off!
MICHAEL	Hold your fire.
MICHAEL	What did you do?
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	You said to 'fire.'
MICHAEL	I said "hold", goddamn it.
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	You said "fire".
LATINO WOMAN	What's happening? What's happening here?
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Stop, stop, stop.
LATINO WOMAN	Oh, my god! Oh, my god, no! Oh, my god!
MICHAEL	Get out of here. Take her away.
LATINO WOMAN	No, you killed him! No! Oh, my god!
JESSIE	But, he didn't have a weapon.
MICHAEL	That's right.
JESSIE	What was it like?
MICHAEL	What, having to make that call?
JESSIE	No, killing an innocent man. Or was it really your call?
MICHAEL	I was in charge and I was wrong.
JESSIE	Dead wrong. Sounds like the department made you the fall guy.
MICHAEL	Somebody had to swing for it.
JESSIE	Does it eat you up?
MICHAEL	What do you think? An innocent man died on my watch.
JESSIE	You mean he was murdered. What did you tell his widow?
MICHAEL	I never spoke to her.
JESSIE	Didn't she deserve an apology? Don't you think all of your victims deserve an apology?
MICHAEL	Well, I'm done apologizing to you.
JESSIE	Just one more. So all your boys in blue can hear who you really are.
MICHAEL	Oh, yeah, and who am I?
JESSIE	Someone who ruins lives.
MICHAEL	Okay, okay, I'm the bad guy. Are you satisfied? Now is that gonna get those people out of there? 
JESSIE	Look around, Michael... that's the only look I've ever known. Sucks, doesn't it?
MICHAEL	Look here, I'm done playing 	your games. You send out a 	hostage or we're coming in.
JESSIE	Be smart, Michael. I'm never going back to jail.
MICHAEL	Move, move, give us a minute.
MICHAEL	How many men did you see 	walk into the bank?
JENNIFER	F-f-four.
MICHAEL	Does he still have Miller in the vault?
JENNIFER	Yeah.
MICHAEL	Do you have any idea why he took him in there?
MICHAEL	Is he still alive? Is he?!
JENNIFER	I don't know!
JACOBS	Hey! She's had enough for today, don't you think?
ARNIE	Hey! What's our next move?
JESSIE	Me and this cop about to watch some TV.
ARNIE	Oh, okay. Hey, I hate to point out the obvious, but what about the cops?
JESSIE	I'm working on it. 
ARNIE	We got the entire force out there, and he's gonna go watch his fucking stories.
SLIM	Man, when is this shit gonna be over?
RANDY	Hey, don't fucking look at me.
SLIM	Fuck you. I got places to be.
RANDY	Fuck me? No, fuck you! I'll blow your fucking head off right now!
JESSIE	Hey! Don't do that.
RANDY	Fuck!
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	All right, here's what we got. This bank is basically built like a fortress. The only quick POE, front doors and windows.
MICHAEL	Don't those hostages make that a bad idea?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Yeah. And if we blow the windows, they'll be major shrapnel flying everywhere.
MICHAEL	Not to mention they'd be caught in a cross fire. What about the side door?
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	No, it's reinforced steel. My guys would be sitting ducks trying to get that open.
MICHAEL	Plus, they have these masks, protecting them from any tear gas option.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	What about flash bangs?
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	At this point, it's probably our best bet. My concern is Miller being out of our immediate strike range.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	How long do you think it would take to reach the vault?
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Best guess, roughly ten seconds.
MICHAEL	That'll give Jessie plenty of time to take out Miller.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Well, he's your brother, Michael. Make the call.
MICHAEL	It's time to go in.
OFFICER BANKS	Hotel manager says the room 	was paid for in cash.
CHERYL	Just keep calling him John Doe?
OFFICER BANKS	I got more bad news. The – at First Savings is now a hostage deal. Shouldn't you head over?
CHERYL	I don't think I can leave him. Can you call Michael for me?
REPORTER	Thanks, Jim. As you can see, the police have the bank surrounded. We haven't been told what the robbers have demanded or how many hostages are inside the bank, but it appears to be a tense standoff. Back to you.
JESSIE	Look, your brave knights are ready to storm the castle. Here they come, walking down the street. I get the funniest looks from every cop I beat.
MILLER	You might kill me, but you're gonna die in this bank, too.
JESSIE	Man, all you cops the same, taking the law into your own hands.
MILLER	We earned that right, asshole.
JESSIE	At what cost? No matter who 	you hurt? But, you got it wrong before.
MILLER	How so?
JESSIE	There ain't a move your boys outside can make that I won't be ready for.
MILLER	You're not gonna walk out of here.
JESSIE	Watch me.
JESSIE	Wait by the vault.
RANDY	What are you doing?
JESSIE	Door.
MICHAEL	Hey! Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot! He still has the hostages!
JESSIE	He's right and one of them is one of you, so back the fuck up!
JESSIE	Listen up carefully. This is a game changer.
MICHAEL	You better talk fast. You got every gun in this town pointed at your head.
JESSIE	Did you know I always use a five man crew to do these banks?
MICHAEL	Yeah, I read your file.
JESSIE	So I'm sure you asked the guard and both tellers how many guys was robbing them.
MICHAEL	Yeah, they all said four. 
JESSIE	You believe them?
MICHAEL	No reason not to.
JESSIE	Do you want to know where my fifth guy in my crew is right now?
MICHAEL	I don't know, in jail? Doing meth? In the morgue, what?
JESSIE	He's with Connie.
MICHAEL	What the fuck did you just say?
JESSIE	I got your wife, Mike, so you tell SWAT and all the other guns in this town to back the fuck up! One cop step foot in my bank... she dies.
MICHAEL	You f-- I'm gonna--
JACOBS	It's not worth it!
JESSE	What you gonna do?
MICHAEL	I find her, you're dead!
JESSIE	Fair enough.
JACOBS	You're completely surrounded, you're not going anywhere.
JESSIE	I don't see nobody here who can stop me. You cops think you safe out here? You have no idea what's really going on.
JESSIE	Now back to our regularly scheduled standoff.
MICHAEL	All right, let him go! That's an order!
MICHAEL	Let me call Connie and end this shit with him once and for all.
AUTOMATED VOICE	Your call has been forwarded to an automated--
MICHAEL	Fuck!
MICHAEL	Go to my house. Take two units... go, now!
MICHAEL	Connie?
JESSIE	Michael, all this stress ain't good for your health.
MICHAEL	If you hurt her, I will—
JESSIE	You can't do shit to me and we both know it. Don't threaten me again.
JESSIE	The cops will no longer be a problem.
ARNIE	How the hell did you just do that?
JESSIE	Because, I'm in charge now. How's my exit strategy going?
RANDY	We're ready to rock and roll.
ARNIE	Are we really getting out of here?
JESSIE	Yep. Strip the hostages.
RANDY	You heard the man, everybody fucking strip! I'm a gentleman, so... ladies first.
JACOBS	Connie, are you here?
JACOBS	The kitchen is trashed and there's some blood on the wall.
MICHAEL	Is her car there?
JACOBS	Yeah, it's in the garage.
MICHAEL	Look, she has nothing to do with us. Please don't do anything to her.
JESSIE	Say I hold all the cards.
MICHAEL	Is that what this is about? You got boxed in, so you destroy my life?
JESSIE	That's just the cherry on top. Now, say it!
MICHAEL	You hold all the cards.
MICHAEL	Pull your team back.
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Look, we might not get another chance at this.
MICHAEL	He has my wife. You stay the fuck away from that bank!
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Pull out.
JESSIE	Don't worry, I'll take good care of her... if you play ball.
JESSIE	What do you say, Mikey, you up for another game of cops and robbers? This time we play for keeps.
JESSIE	Now, I want your SWAT van. Black out the front windows, so your snipers can't take out one of my guys.
MICHAEL	Fuck you! Do it yourself.
JESSIE	I want to see your cops working on it in five minutes or... well, you can figure out the "or what."
MILLER	Jesus Christ!
JESSIE	I'm flattered, but no. Don't worry, though, you'll see him soon enough.
JESSIE	Before my ride is ready, I have a few more questions for you.
MILLER	Okay, okay.
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	He can not have our van as his getaway vehicle.
MICHAEL	Look, until I find Connie, I have to go along with his bullshit, okay?
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	He goes from that fortress to a mobile one. It's gonna be next to impossible to take that van down.
MICHAEL	I have no choice.
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	This is a really bad call.
MICHAEL	But it's my call! See, I'm in charge, so don't do one fucking thing without my approval, you got me?	
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	So we're back to this?
SHAKERS	Easy, Michael.
MICHAEL	Yeah. Blacken out those windows or I'll find someone who will.
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Fine.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Michael, just so you know, we got every available unit out looking for Connie. And we're trying to trace her cell phone, too. Stay focused, okay?
NICHOLSON	Captain.
NICHOLSON	Get this, First Savings had an armored car pick up today. Guards never checked in.
SHAKERS	Those two are retired cops.
NICHOLSON	Seriously?
SHAKERS	That's more cops for this lunatic. Jacobs just found blood at Michael's house.
NICHOLSON	Jesus... any word on her cell?
SHAKERS	No. No, but the battery must be out of it. Connie is his whole world.
NICHOLSON	I know.
MILLER	What could you possibly gain from this?
JESSIE	We're building trust. I have to believe what you tell me.
MILLER	Fuck you and your trust.
MICHAEL	What?
JESSIE	I have another request.
MICHAEL	Something for the hostages?
JESSIE	Fuck the hostages. Tell me, do you know how you define character?
MICHAEL	No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me.
JESSIE	It's not by your badge or gun, or what you say when the bright lights are shining in your face.
JESSIE	It's what you do when no one's looking. When you all alone.
MICHAEL	There a point to this?
JESSIE	Since I don't trust your character, I want a news camera to go live on my SWAT van.
JESSE	I want to make sure you don't do nothing stupid to my new whip. You got two minutes.
MICHAEL	Hey! Get that news crew to go live on the SWAT van right 	now.
OFFICERS	Hey, hey, hey!
SHAKERS	What are you doing?
MICHAEL	Playing along.
SHAKERS	You sure you're okay?
MICHAEL	I'm fine.
JESSIE	Looks like I can kind of trust him again. What? Yeah, me too.
JESSIE	You really think he owes me an apology, huh? Why hasn't he yet? I'd say it was his pride getting in the way. You really think that could work?
JESSIE	Make him apologize to the world? That's a damn, good idea.
SHAKERS	Michael, you gonna get that?
MICHAEL	I got every cop in this state looking for her. How long do you think it's gonna take me to find her?
JESSIE	I'll tell you where she is once I have my van. As long as you do this one last thing.
MICHAEL	Well, spit it out. But I guarantee you one thing... you're not walking away from this.
SHAKERS	Michael's judgment is beyond cloudy.
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Just say the word.
SHAKERS	Cap says, if your guy's get a clean look--
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Copy that.
MICHAEL	I need a black and white.
NICHOLSON	Hey! You don't have to do this, man.
MICHAEL	Yes, I do.
SHAKERS	Do it off-camera. He can't make you do this on live TV.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	You're putting the entire department on the line here, you know that?
MICHAEL	Well, maybe it's time for my face to be all over the news again.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	No! I order you to back off.
MICHAEL	Well, it's not really up to you anymore now, is it?
MICHAEL	She's here. What do you want me to do?
JESSIE	All the things a cop should say to the woman he made a widow. Admit what you did, then beg her for forgiveness.
MICHAEL	Tell me Connie's okay.
JESSIE	She will be, once you clean the skeletons out of your closet. Freeing yourself from the prison of your own mind.
JESSE	The one thing you can't escape from. Do us proud, bro. You could say, a lot is riding on your performance.
MICHAEL	Hi... do you remember me?
LATINO WOMAN	What do you want?
MICHAEL	That night, we tried to talk to your husband, but he wouldn't come out.
LATINO WOMAN	He was afraid of being deported. He thought you were going to take him away from his family.
MICHAEL	We thought your children were inside. That he might hurt them.
LATINO WOMAN	His own children? You didn't know him at all.
MICHAEL	You're right... look, we made a mistake.
LATINO WOMAN	You call killing him a mistake?
MICHAEL	When I was a little boy, my brother went to prison, because I was too afraid to speak up.
MICHAEL	So, I became a police officer, so I could speak up for those people who were afraid to.
MICHAEL	The mistake was... we never should have been there in the first place.
LATINO WOMAN	You took everything from me. I intend to do the same to you and to your incompetent department.
JESSE	That boy looks good on TV.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Do you know what just happened here?
MICHAEL	Yeah, I finally told the truth.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	What does that have to do with anything? She is gonna sue the shit out of us now.
MICHAEL	Well, good, maybe that will help her suffering.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Let me tell you something. When this whole thing with your brother is done, you're gonna be out of a job.
MICHAEL	Oh, you think I give a shit about that, huh?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	I see the resemblance now, you both belong behind bars.
MICHAEL	That night, I listened to her husband. He was about to blow the whistle on some dirty cops.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	You can't really get past all this, can you?
MICHAEL	A group of cops who got rich off this town. He knew about it, and someone shot him in cold blood.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	No! What happened here today was you lost control of the entire scene. Only you and nobody else, goddamn it!
JACOBS	Michael.
MICHAEL	What?
JACOBS	We finally pinpointed Connie's location.
MICHAEL	Where is she?
MICHAEL	She's in the bank?
JACOBS	Her phone is.
MICHAEL	I need a minute.
NICHOLSON	Mike, there's still a chance.
MICHAEL	I said I need a fucking minute!
JACOBS	Let's go.
MICHAEL	Fuck! Goddamn it!
JESSIE	Hello, Michael.
MICHAEL	No more tricks, no more games. The van is ready. I've done everything you've asked for. What's the move?
JESSIE	Good job out there. It appears you have restored my faith in my neighborhood crime fighter.
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Okay, if you get the shot, take it. Duncan and Clark will clear the bank with me once they're out. Go!
ARNIE	He wanted an audience, he's got one.
MICHAEL	Jessie, you still there?
JESSIE	You know, it just occurred to me why I always hated cops. It's the power. They love holding that shit over you.
JESSE	When you're a kid, you learned to run from a black and white. Because if they catch you, you're forced to obey their every command.
MICHAEL	Yeah, but, you still hold all the cards, right?
JESSIE	Today I do, but it feels empty. Like a king who sits up on the throne. Now what?
MICHAEL	You still have to get out of there.
JESSIE	I wonder if this is how the President feels? All alone in the White House, sitting on top of all that power.
JESSE	No one left to challenge him. No real wars to fight and no more worlds left to conquer.
MICHAEL	Come on, Jesse, you're not giving up on me, are you?
JESSIE	Going to juvie when I did... man, I never had a chance, bro.
MICHAEL	You think I did?
JESSIE	You know who my favorite Presidents are?
MICHAEL	Stay with me, Jesse. Come on, this is almost done.
JESSIE	Monroe. Garfield. Adams Washington. Polk. Grant. Did I mention Adams and Washington?
MICHAEL	You did.
JESSIE	Forgive me, Michael, I've been so selfish today. I never once asked how you was holding up?
MICHAEL	Yeah, I'm fine. I'd just really like to see my wife again.
JESSIE	Then you have to be willing to take drastic steps to go all in. Are you ready for that?
MICHAEL	Yep.
JESSIE	Then we're coming out.
ARNIE	Hey, everything all right in there?
JESSIE	Justice has been served.
NICHOLSON	Hey, was that a gun shot or what?
MICHAEL	Hey, listen, nobody kills Jessie until we have Connie. Got it?
JACOBS	But, after we find her
MICHAEL	Everybody, give them room, get back, keep back!
MICHAEL	Do not fire, all suspects have not cleared the bank.
JACOBS	What do we do now?
MICHAEL	Everybody hold positions. We don't have eyes on Miller or Jessie.
MICHAEL	Did Jessie get in the van?
SNIPER #	We can't see shit.
MICHAEL	Anybody have eyes on Miller? Anybody see Miller?
SNIPER #	Negative. Should we take out the tires?
MICHAEL	No, no, no, no, no, let's—let it play out.
JACOBS	They're splitting up.
MICHAEL	Let's go! Split up!
JACOBS	Go, go, go, go!
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Clear the bank!
JACOBS	This is his big escape plan? A low-speed chase? It doesn't make any sense.
MICHAEL	Nothing he's done today has 	made sense. Where are you going, Jessie?
DUNCAN	I got eyes on one of the hostages.
CLARK	He's alive. Get an EMT.
DUNCAN	You in the vault, come out now.
MICHAEL	Where is she?
JESSIE	She's having a coffee on East Grand.
MICHAEL	Don't bullshit me.
JESSIE	Now why would I do that?
MICHAEL	Send a unit to the Coffee House on East Grand.
MICHAEL	Jessie, which van are you in?
JESSIE	Wouldn't you like to know.
JACOBS	I need a unit sent to the coffee house on East Grand... now.
DUNCAN	Jesus.
JACOBS	Jacobs. Are you sure?
JACOBS	Miller's dead.
MICHAEL	Enough of this shit! All units, take both vans now! Repeat, take both vans now!
MICHAEL	Out! Get out now!
MICHAEL	Hands!
 ARMORED GUARD #	They said if I didn't drive the van, they'd kill my family.
FEMALE HOSTAGE	Agh! Oh, my god!
MICHAEL	Suspects are not in the van. Repeat, suspects are not in the van.
NICHOLSON	Michael, I only got an armored car guard and four hostages dressed as our suspects.
MICHAEL	Deakins, is the bank cleared?
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Everything but the basement.
MICHAEL	Check it. He didn't just vanish into thin air.
MICHAEL	Shit. I know where they are.
OFFICER	Get out of here! Move, move, move!
ELECTRIC WORKER	All right, all right! Everything's good.
OFFICER	Come on, come on! Move it, 	move it!
ELECTRIC WORKER	I get it! I get it!
SWAT COMMANDER DEAKINS	Where the hell does that lead?
DUNCAN	Sewer system. Looks like they predug it in from the other side.
CLARK	Could they get out through a manhole?
MICHAEL	All units, seal off the area! They're in the electric truck.
MICHAEL	Nobody leaves the parking lot.
JACOBS	Freeze!  
OFFICER	All units, - suspects are at the Granite Falls Mall.
MICHAEL	Drop it! Drop it! Now!
JACOBS	Maybe he's in a store?
MICHAEL	No, Jesse wouldn't box himself in again. This way!
JESSE	Oh, shit!
MICHAEL	No, no, no! He still has Connie!
JACOBS	Shit!
SHAKERS	Freeze! Get down to the ground!
RANDY	Hey! I still got his fucking wife! I'll have her killed right now! I ain't fucking around! And I want a fucking car right now.
SHAKERS	Not gonna happen! Get down! Down!
RANDY	Fuck you, cops!
SHAKERS	This guy didn't even know they were in the truck. Stopping to shop just threw a wrench in their getaway plan.
NICHOLSON	Yeah, and Connie was never at the coffee shop.
SHAKERS	That's some plan. We got all the money returned. We got three of them over here are fish food.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	How many times can one guy fuck up in one day?
MICHAEL	Captain, get out of my face.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	How did Cheryl ever clear you?
JACOBS	It's not over, I clipped Jessie, we have cops covering every hospital.
MICHAEL	But he still has my wife.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Go home, Michael.
MICHAEL	Here's your opportunity to make me the department's fall guy again.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	What ?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Maybe I'll do that!
MICHAEL	Hey!
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	You fucked up everything today!
MICHAEL	Let me tell you something
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	You done?
JACOBS	Mike! We found these taped to both the armored car drivers.
MICHAEL	They look like part of some ledger.
JACOBS	What should I do with it?
MICHAEL	Until we figure out what's really going on, just keep it quiet.
JACOBS	Where are you going?
MICHAEL	To find Jessie. It's a long shot, but it's the only one I got.
JACOBS	Well, I can't let you go by yourself. Not in your state.
JACOBS	Nixon, two units, Charlie!
JOHN DOE	I got nothing, fucking nothing!
CHERYL	John, we've been over this a million times...
JOHN DOE	Oh, I'm sorry that my suffering is a source of boredom for you.
JOHN DOE	I think that's my phone. That might be her.
CHERYL	Want me to get it?
JOHN DOE	Get it! Yes! Please! Now.
JOHN DOE	Baby? I thought you had gone. I've been waiting here all day.
JOHN DOE	Yes, yes, yes.
JOHN DOE	She loves me, doc.
CHERYL	Book him on a psych hold. I'll check on him later.
MICHAEL	Remember, we can't get in a shoot out with him, he still has my wife. Give me a minute to talk him out.
JACOBS	You want to go in alone?
MICHAEL	I grew up in that house. I'll get Jessie out one way or another.
JACOBS	Roger that, I'll call for backup.
MICHAEL	Good. I'll keep my walkie open, so you guys can hear how it's going.
JACOBS	You got one minute.
JACOBS	I need backup at a possible location for the First Savings suspect. We're at Sequoia Court.
MICHAEL	You know it's a bad idea to kill a cop, right?
MICHAEL	Maybe I underestimated you... but it's time to take you in.
JESSIE	So that's how you see this ending, huh?
MICHAEL	Put down the gun.
JESSIE	Says the guy staring down the barrel of mine.
MICHAEL	They've given me one minute to reason with you.
JESSIE	They're way out there, they ain't saving you.
MICHAEL	I'm not the one who needs saving. Or do you plan on dying in here?
JESSIE	I've been ready for that ever since I stepped into that bank. Question is, are you?
MICHAEL	How long are we gonna do this, huh? It's over!
JESSIE	Your boys out there look antsy.
JESSIE	They want some more of my 	blood?
MICHAEL	Tell me where to look!
JESSIE	I honestly don't have a clue.
MICHAEL	I'm done playing with you.
JESSIE	Finally something we both can agree on.
JACOBS	I need fire and rescue at my location now! 
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Hey, here.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Hey, Chief, what do you got?
FIRE CHIEF	I can't get any bodies out of there. Damn fire is too heated.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Yeah, why is that?
FIRE CHIEF	House was packed with C-. I doubt we find anything there after we put the fire out.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Aw, Jesus. Thanks, thanks.
CHERYL	What's happened?
JACOBS	Michael picked the wrong house to get into a shoot out in. 
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Our bank robbery turned into a hostage situation. It was a hell of a day.
CHERYL	Anybody we know?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Yeah... Michael's brother.
CHERYL	Jessie?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Mm-hm, the two went at each other all day. Lot of bad blood there.
CHERYL	They didn't hate each other.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Hate isn't a strong enough word.
CHERYL	No, I mean, I know that they had a complicated past, but they worked everything out months ago.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	You sure about that?
CHERYL	I'm positive. I was their therapist.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	And you don't think they could have had another falling out?
CHERYL	Um... it's possible. I mean, Jessie was a bit of a wildcard.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Uh-huh. 
JACOBS	Captain, what about Connie? I mean, you think she might--
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	No, no, no, we don't know that. I've got every squad in the city scouring for her.
SHAKERS	We might have four bodies?
CHERYL	Four?
SHAKERS	Miller was in the bank. Jessie found out he was a cop.
CHERYL	Oh my god, that's it.
CHERYL	Miller and Jessie, I mean, they've crossed paths before, a long time ago.
JACOBS	What are you talking about?
CHERYL	Miller was the detective that arrested Jessie for murder when he was a kid.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	How do you know about that?
CHERYL	He swore up and down that Miller framed him for that murder.
NICHOLSON	Right. So we're supposed to believe a felon over a decorated detective?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Come on, Cheryl, you think Jessie did all that just to kill Miller?
NICHOLSON	It makes sense. We got the money back.
JACOBS	What are the odds of this happening on Miller's last trip to the bank?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Yeah. He was our treasurer.
NICHOLSON	So?
SHAKERS	Miller had access to our retirement account.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Not only ours, the entire county.
MILLER	That account can only be accessed by a cop. Why do you want the code?
JESSIE	Well, if that's true, then you shouldn't be afraid to hand it over.
MILLER	What could you possibly gain from this?
JESSIE	We're building trust. I have to believe what you're telling me.
MILLER	Fuck you and your trust.
JESSIE	Hello, Michael.
MICHAEL	No more tricks, no more games. The van is ready. I've done everything you've asked for. What's the move? 
JESSIE	Good job out there. It appears you have restored my faith in the neighborhood crime fighter.
JESSIE	You know who my favorite Presidents are?
MICHAEL	Stay with me, Jesse, come on. This is almost done.
JESSIE	Monroe. Garfield. Adams. Washington. Polk. Grant. Did I mention Adams and Washington?
MICHAEL	You did.
JESSIE	Forgive me, Michael, I've been so selfish today. I've never once asked how you was holding up?
MICHAEL	I'm fine. I'd just really like to see my wife again.
JESSIE	Then you have to be willing to take drastic steps, to go all in. Are you ready for that?
MICHAEL	Yep.
JESSIE	Then we're coming out.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Our $ million is gone.
JACOBS	Eight? I thought we only had five?
NICHOLSON	Wait, we don't know Jessie did this for sure. I mean, who else had access to those codes?
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	In our department? Miller and me--
MILLER	You don't know who the hell you're messing with.
JESSIE	Really? This con once told me about a group of dirty cops.
JESSIE	These cops took money to look the other way. They kept that money mixed in with their retirement fund. 
JESSIE	They were real smart about it, too, except for one thing. One of these pigs kept a detailed ledger.	
MILLER	Hell of a tale, only you're never going to find any ledger.
JESSIE	You mean this one? I've been watching you.
JESSIE	Why go through all this trouble you ask? Because you stole something from me. Wanna know what? Love.
MILLER	Who the fuck could love anybody like you?
JESSIE	That's my point. I never had the chance to love anyone, except for one person.
MILLER	Your cell mate?
JESSIE	My brother.
JESSIE	You see, after Michael's 'incident,' Connie didn't want to be married to a cop no more, so after today, Michael's done with all that. He done with this town. He's done with you.
MILLER	You know I'm really glad I framed your little punk ass back in the day.
JESSIE	You got two choices here, you could take your chances in court or...
JESSIE	My advice, jail is no place for an ex-dirty cop. But the choice is yours. And that's something you never gave me when you decided to murder my father in cold blood.
MILLER	You know what you are? You're the nigger on election day. When I was little, if a politician was behind in an election, he'd just lynch a black man for raping a white woman, even looking at her.
MILLER	Then he'd win the election... so the niggers were always very  nervous at election day.
MILLER	You eat watermelon like a nigger on election day. You eat chicken like a nigger on election day.
MILLER	You spend money like a nigger on election day. You're the nigger on election day.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	What?
SHAKERS	The M.E. just said that Miller died from a self-inflicted G.S.W.
CHERYL	He killed himself?
FIRE CHIEF	Captain, you want to see this. Somebody dug a tunnel. It leads right into the sewer system.
NICHOLSON	Yeah, it goes on for quite some ways, all the way to China.
JACOBS	I'd say they have a good two hours on us.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	How is it that the only person who knew about all this was conveniently tied up all day?
CHERYL	Really? You're accusing me? 	You know Jessie said you were also there the night his father was murdered.
CAPTAIN RANDOLPH	Fuck that! I think they both played you for the fool.
JACOBS	Hey, Doc, Michael wasn't all there today. He was taking these.
CHERYL	These are for heartburn.
NICHOLSON	Why would he be pretending...
JACOBS	He was also right about something else going on.
NICHOLSON	I found the third envelope on the bank manager, Beckett. It was taped to him.
CHERYL	What does that say? FIND-JOHN-DOE.
JOHN DOE	Well, it's always nice to see cops can follow some simple instructions.
JACOBS	Give me one good reason why I don't haul your ass to jail right now?
JOHN DOE	I'll give you  million.
JOHN DOE	A gift from the dearly departed. On the back page, you're gonna notice an account number where your retirement money is safely intact.
JOHN DOE	As well as the seven other guys that have been robbing this town blind for years.
JACOBS	$ million? Because I'm pretty sure it's $ million.
JOHN DOE	That's right. Of course, $ million of it was dirty.  Trust me, you did your department a favor.
JACOBS	What's your connection to them?
JOHN DOE	In the joint, I told Jessie a story about some crooked ass cops. It seemed to get his attention.
NICHOLSON	Wait a minute, if they got the money, what do you get?
JOHN DOE	Just peace of mind, knowing that my town is run by honest cops.
JACOBS AND NICHOLSON	Miller?
JACOBS	Oh, shit. Randolph.
JACOBS	Shakers.
JACOBS	Deakins.
JACOBS	Frank.
JACOBS	Recognize this, Beckett?
BECKETT	I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
JOHN DOE	After you, bud.
JOHN DOE	Peace of mind, honest cops, and the American dream.
CHERYL	He just gets to walk away scot-free?
JACOBS	We got no evidence, no link connecting Michael to the crimes being committed.
NICHOLSON	Only shot we got is if we find Michael and Jessie together.
CHERYL	Guess he played all of us.
MICHAEL	Hey.
CONNIE	Hey.
MICHAEL	So... where would you like to go?
CONNIE	Everywhere.
