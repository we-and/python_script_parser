166,JED,"Damn right, I do.",17,0.34
167,WILLIE,Why don't we just head straight South? It'd be faster.,54,1.08
168,JED,"Where is your sense of adventure, Willie? We's easy targets out here, blind man can track us.",93,1.86
169,SILAS,"Jed, you better let that kid ride tomorrow. If Indians come down on us, we're gonna have to ride fast.",102,2.04
170,JED,"Well, if he can't keep up, drag him.",36,0.72
171,SILAS,"He's a kid, Jed. Damn, even I got a little compassion.",54,1.08
172,JED,"That's why you're following, Silas. Not leading. I'll be back. Hey. You know I'm always watchin' you, right? Good.",114,2.28
173,SILAS,What's gotten into him?,23,0.46

195,WILLIE,"Hey, Jed. Talkin' to that MacMasters' kid.",42,0.84
196,JED,Yeah?,5,0.1
197,WILLIE,"He says the sheriff from that town is gettin' up a posse and comin' after us, not the Marshal. Not MacMaster.",109,2.18
198,JED,No. It will be MacMasters.,26,0.52
199,WILLIE,I was just sayin' Marshal could be another month or so before he gets back to the ranch.,88,1.76
200,JED,"What if he got back the same day we took the kid, Willie?",57,1.14
201,BLADE,He could be here tonight.,25,0.5
202,WILLIE,We ain't got a lookout.,23,0.46
203,JED,"That's right, we don't. That's why I just elected you, Willie. Cass'll spell you in two hours. Blade, saddle up.",112,2.24
204,BLADE,What?,5,0.1
205,JED,"Saddle up. Want you to backtrack. I'll find a spot from here to them hills, look out. Once you find MacMasters and his posse, get your ass back here.",149,2.98
206,BLADE,Right. I know what to do.,25,0.5

217,TUCKER,"Son of a bitch! I got a loose tooth, dammit!",44,0.88
218,BRITT,You can tell they're running fast. Prints are deep.,51,1.02
219,TUCKER,"Yep, I see.",11,0.22
220,BRITT,"If they hit up the bank, then this way makes sense. Avoid a posse from the Laramie trail.",89,1.78
221,TUCKER,"Yeah, it's just what I was thinkin'.",36,0.72
222,BRITT,"You done much tracking, Tucker?",31,0.62
223,TUCKER,Ain't much of it called for in town.,36,0.72

236,BRITT,He's a good man.,16,0.32
237,TUCKER,"I didn't figure you for much of an Injun-lover, Marshal MacMasters.",67,1.34
238,BRITT,"Well, I might even learn to like you one day. I'm full of surprises.",68,1.36
239,TUCKER,"MacMasters, I'm not ridin' with no half-breed!",46,0.92
240,BRITT,Then turn your horse and head for home.,39,0.78
241,BRITT,I need Chaska on this hunt a hell of a lot more than I need you.,64,1.28
242,JED,"Come here, boy. Give me that hat.",33,0.66
243,CHAD,"Hey, give it back. It's hot as blazes out here, give me my hat!",63,1.26

252,TUCKER,Aren't we gonna bury 'em? It'll take 15 minutes.,48,0.96
253,BRITT,You got a shovel?,17,0.34
254,TUCKER,No.,3,0.06
