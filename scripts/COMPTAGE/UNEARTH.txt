??	Thanks.
??	What the hell is she doing fishing?
??	It's okay.
??	Leave her alone.
??	It's your daughter.
??	Let's go!
George	Mornin'.
Tom	Mornin', George.
??	Hey, I wanted to say sorry again, for your loss.
??	He was a great man, he was great to me.
??	How's Reese?
??	He's a good baby, good kid.
??	Come by and see him, huh?
??	Yeah, we oughta get a beer some time, man.
??	It's been way too long.
??	Let's do that.
??	All right.
??	Hey.
??	Hey.
??	Oh, you got my hair.
George	Hey, I got breakfast.
Kim	Okay, thank you.
??	You're so silly.
George	You sure you don't want me to take you?
??	No, Dad, no special treatment, okay?
??	I left a list on the fridge with feeding times and nap times.
??	Hey, hey, I raised two kids.
??	We got this, right?
??	We got this.
??	Bye, time for Mommy to go.
??	Bye, I love you. (laughs)
??	Combine's clean.
??	I'll be in my studio.
??	Aub, can you pick me up some new gloves?
??	Yeah, they're on the list.
??	Thanks.
??	You stink.
??	Did you sweep up the chaff?
??	No.
??	I'll do it in the morning.
??	All we need is for someone to slip and break their neck.
??	You see the paper?
??	No, why?
??	Our greedy township supervisors have started issuing drilling permits.
??	Hey, Jill.
??	We need a little help with these hospital bills.
??	Yes, we, me and Kim, your daughter.
??	Well, the garage has just been, will you let me talk?
??	Why do you even bother calling her, Dad?
George	Okay, the garage has been a little bit slow.
??	No.
??	She doesn't give a shit.
??	Right, yeah, no, of course not.
??	Cause we all just can't get up and leave whenever we fucking want, can we, Jill?
??	Okay, so that's five.
??	Here ya go.
??	Okay.
??	Thank you.
??	Have a great day.
??	Thank you.
??	Hey, George.
??	Hey.
??	I got you all finished up.
??	Here.
??	You know what, if you wanna pay cash
??	I'll knock another % off that.
??	Yeah.
??	George, what the hell?
??	Oh, yeah, I noticed that your rear brakes needed replaced.
??	Okay, but you told me $.
??	Well, yeah, for the inspection.
??	But then I have to do the emissions, that's , that's outta my hands, and, like I said, your rear brakes were low.
??	Okay.
??	Low enough to not pass inspection?
??	Practically.
??	Look, I charged you  bucks for that, and that's a big discount, and I saved you a trip.
??	You woulda been back here in two months.
??	You know what, George?
??	Just cut the bullshit.
??	I can do $ cash, that's it.
??	I got a family.
??	Take it or leave it.
??	Or I'm gonna report you.
??	Let me try.
??	Make sure it's good and tight.
??	That cover comes loose in the field, and you're gonna lose another whole day of work.
??	I've done this before.
??	Yeah, you have.
??	Up and down the back all night searching for it.
Tom	Fuck!
??	Weather reports say we're not gonna get a break from this heat any time soon.
??	God help us if we get another weak yield this season.
??	God ain't gonna do shit, Mom.
??	I'm telling you, we gotta go big or we gotta get out.
??	More field corn, maybe even soybeans, otherwise we're gonna have a For Sale sign on our field next.
??	Don't you dare say that!
??	If your Daddy heard you say that he'd--
??	Dad wouldn't have driven by George's farm every day without making an offer.
??	Make an offer, with what?
??	We haven't even recouped our losses from shuttin' down dairy production.
??	Sellin' the cows was the best idea we ever had!
??	And it's not enough!
??	It's still not enough!
??	If you spent as much time workin' as you did bitchin'!
??	Wait.
??	Stay in that light.
??	I always wanted to be a model.
??	Isn't that silly?
??	I wonder what Joe wanted to be?
??	He told me when he got out of the service buying this land was the first thing he and Kathryn did.
??	I guess farming was in their DNA.
??	Not so much for others.
??	Every family has its problems.
??	Tom and his folks were really good to us when we needed it most.
??	But we're just in a rough patch, is all.
??	Mom, I've given a lotta years of my life to this farm.
??	I stayed and I took care of Joe.
??	But you're the one that married Tom, not me.
??	Thanks.
??	Need a ride home?
Heather	Hey, Dad.
??	Hey!
??	About gave me a heart attack.
??	You gonna stay for the weekend?
??	Yeah, I had a friend drop me off.
??	I wanted to see Reesey.
??	Great, glad you're here.
??	Just grabbed some bagels.
??	Gotta catch the bus!
??	Good thing Heather was here, where were you?
??	I was just up at the garage working.
??	Here, you wanna grab a bagel before you go?
??	Here.
??	Say bye to Mama.
??	Hey, you want one of these?
??	I'm good.
??	Hey, Billy, George Lomack callin'.
??	Hope, uh, hope this finds you guys well.
??	I was looking through my book, and I saw that you're a little behind on your annual auto inspection.
??	Thought you might wanna get out here and get somethin' on the books.
??	So give me a call if you do.
??	Again, hope you're well.
Recording	We're sorry, your call.
??	DJ, hey, how you guys doin', huh?
??	She did, yeah, yeah, she's doin' good.
??	Oh, he's great, yeah, it's a boy.
??	Reese.
??	Yeah, well, hey listen I was goin' through my book, and I see that you're about due for your inspection so do you want to make an appointment and get in here, and get that taken care of?
??	You did.
??	Hey, DJ, it's a pretty big chain, you know.
??	They're not gonna give you the personal service that I would.
??	Yeah.
??	All right, well, if that doesn't work out then...
??	I'll be here. 
??	All right.
??	Yep, I'll tell her.
??	I'm home!
??	Only  days to go.
??	Jesus, Dad, wake up!
??	What are you doing?
??	What happened?
??	Nothing, nothing, I just closed my eyes for a second.
??	No, it's not nothing, Dad.
??	Reese could have fallen on the floor or gotten a hold of something or like--
??	He can't even crawl yet, honey.
??	Why weren't you watching him?
??	I was right in the kitchen.
??	He didn't do it on purpose, Kim.
??	Are you okay?
??	Hey, what time is it?
??	Is it three o'clock already?
??	Eddie Drake, Patriot Exploration.
??	Thanks for coming out.
??	Well, this is a beautiful property you have here.
??	I notice your land for sale sign.
??	Have you had any takers?
??	We could pay up to $ an acre.
??	Plus a percentage of proceeds from gas production, of course.
??	Does that sound like something you might be interested in?
??	Here you go.
??	Thank you.
??	Hello, Ma'am.
??	Eddie Drake, Patriot Exploration.
??	Not interested.
??	I'm just lookin' for a moment of your time to talk about some natural gas opportunities.
??	Is that right?
??	Well, I'd like to talk to you about the opportunities inside the barrel of my shotgun.
??	Why don't you stay here?
??	I'll go get it.
??	You have yourself a good day, Ma'am.
??	Christina!
??	I need you to do me a favor.
George	Hey.
??	Late night?
??	Heather!
??	When did you get home?
??	Last night.
??	Oh.
??	Well, Kathryn wanted me to invite you guys over for dinner tonight.
??	Oh, that sounds fun, Dad?
??	Yeah, of course.
??	Tell her we'll be there.
??	Well, you look good.
??	Very farmer chic.
??	Thanks.
??	How long you home for?
??	Just the weekend.
??	Oh, bummer.
??	Yeah.
??	Okay, well, I'll see you in a bit.
??	Kay.
??	Yeah.
??	You working on that portfolio?
??	Not as much as I'd like to lately.
??	How's college goin', Heather?
??	It's good.
??	Oh, come on, tell 'em.
??	She's doin' great, she's at the top of her class.
??	And she just made the softball team.
??	How's things with the garage, George?
??	Don't see much goin' on over there.
??	Kathryn.
??	You want a beer?
??	Yeah, I'm due.
??	George, I know you're in a tough spot.
??	Now that business with your wife was surely a heart break, but I gotta tell ya, her leaving you and the girls the land that is a blessing, a real opportunity.
??	But the longer you wait, the longer it's gonna take you to get that earth producin' again.
??	We've been outta the farm business for a long time.
??	Well, then.
??	You could lease me the land.
??	You know I'll get it back to health.
??	How much?
??	We'd give you a fair  price for it, George.
??	Well, how much? an acre.
??	Let's take the baby inside.
??	George, I know you had a visitor today.
??	Is he havin' a hard time?
??	May I?
??	Oh.
??	See?
??	I just hate pumping.
??	I mean, I feel like a cow or something.
??	Well, you could always give him formula.
??	Really, it's safe for him if I switch?
??	Absolutely.
??	If I had it to do over again,
??	I'd give Christina formula.
??	There's a lot of things I'd do differently if I had another one.
??	Here you go. (tongue clicking)
??	You know, if you ever need anything you give me a call, all right?
??	I was about your age when I had Christina so I know how hard it can be.
??	Thanks, Aubrey.
??	So you and his daddy?
??	His dad's a teenager.
??	You're a teenager.
??	Well, not anymore.
??	Did, um, did Christina ever meet her dad?
??	Ngh-ngh.
??	I don't think you guys are seeing the full picture.
??	Kathryn, look around you.
??	You got a highway at the back of your field now.
??	And where's your dairy business, and my farm?
??	The world is leaving us behind.
??	But if you make a tree good, its fruit will be good.
??	You make a tree bad, its fruit's gonna be bad.
??	We don't need fuckin' fruit.
??	We need a miracle.
??	Yeah.
??	George!
??	Hey, Kathryn, you make the decisions that's best for your family.
??	I'll make the decisions that's best for mine.
??	Not much goin' off over there.
??	Really?
??	Who does she think she is?
??	They're just concerned.
??	To be honest, so am I.
??	Why didn't you tell me the garage was going under?
??	What do you mean, the garage isn't going under.
??	What, are you going through all my bills now?
??	Yeah, 'cause your lying them on every table in the house.
??	Okay, this gas company.
??	What, you said it's a check at signing for the lease and then it's royalties?
??	As far as I understood.
??	Okay, and then we see what Kathryn can offer.
??	Well, she can't offer shit, okay?
??	It's not exactly the
??	Garden of Eden over there.
??	Okay, Dad, I know you're pissed, but we have to consider every option.
??	They can't help us, Heather.
??	Okay, whatever.
??	We can cut costs over here,
??	I mean, we don't need cable.
??	Fine.
??	And we'll turn the lights off.
??	Great.
??	Let's just be Amish now.
??	I'm serious, Dad.
??	You know my school?
??	No, no.
??	Oh, great, welcome to the conversation, Kim.
??	While we're here, we don't need these.
??	What, you're not gonna cancel my phone, are you?
??	Jesus!
??	Kim, you know they're a fuckin' waste of money.
??	And that's all you have to say, seriously?
??	While Dad's drowning in your medical bills?
??	Oh, don't stop!
George	Oh yeah.
??	That was fun.
??	Did you do some more submissions this week?
??	Mm-hm.
??	Some in New York.
??	One in Chicago.
??	Where do you wanna go?
??	MoMA.
??	Yancey or Guggenheim.
??	Is that Europe?
??	You told me that when
??	Joe dies, you'd leave.
??	When?
??	Good Lord, that's a lotta food.
Vendor	Breakfast of champions.
??	Thanks, man, appreciate it.
??	 [Vendor] What can I get ya?
??	Christina!
??	Okay.
??	It's okay.
??	You're gonna have to go home now, Kim.
??	Okay, I got it go.
??	Okay.
??	Okay.
??	I got you.
??	Bye.
??	Okay.
Heather	Still forbidden to talk to us?
Christina	Of course. (laughs)
??	Remember when Tom and George used to bring us out here hunting with them?
??	Yeah.
??	You guys are gonna love this.
??	Camo'ed up head to toe.
??	And then you.
??	Would fall asleep.
??	Like every single time.
??	Every single time, yeah.
??	He used to get so upset when
??	I didn't see the turkey.
??	Like as if I didn't see them every single day running across the field.
??	I always loved that shirt.
??	It's so soft.
??	Get your mitts off my weed pocket, Lomack.
??	Tom and Aubrey still come up here?
??	No, I highly doubt that.
??	Ah, no, give me that.
??	Give me that!
??	You know, I started submitting to galleries.
??	That's great.
??	I mean, did you hear anything back or?
??	Not yet.
??	You will.
??	How about you?
??	I can't believe Kim graduated.
??	Yeah, thank the maker.
??	So?
??	I lost my grant and, yeah, we could never really afford college anyway so.
??	The gas well is not?
??	It's helping, it's just, we were in so much debt after everything and just kinda crossing fingers for that first royalty check, you know?
??	I'm looking into online courses.
??	But, you know, our fuckin' internet's shit.
??	You are a brilliant, beautiful badass woman, and you are gonna figure this shit out, right?
??	Yes.
??	Huh?
??	Yes.
??	Holy shit.
??	This is good weed. (laughs)
??	Fishin'?
??	I bought us a couple hours.
??	You know, this never woulda happened if Joe were still around.
??	You know, Kathryn, the
??	Lomacks didn't really have a choice.
??	There's always a choice.
??	And pretty soon, your step-daddy's gonna have a choice.
??	God knows I love my son, but when I'm gone, he's gonna sell.
??	Unless I leave the farm to you.
??	What, no, no, Kathryn,
??	I didn't sign up for that.
??	You're a farmer, Christina.
??	No, I'm not and I don't wanna be.
??	Then what do you wanna be, a photographer?
??	You know, years ago, when Joe and I used to travel we'd go to the bullfights, and there's a place in the ring, querencia, it's a place, of sanctuary for the bull, where the bull feels safe and strong and protected.
??	And you may think your photographs are separate, but there is a love of the land that shines through.
??	This farm is your querencia.
??	And if you leave it,
??	you're gonna lose yourself.
??	And your pictures aren't ever gonna be as good.
??	That's right.
??	Tell you over and over and over.
??	Jesus Christ.
??	Okay, try it!
??	Try it!
Aubrey	I'm not sure, Tom.
??	What do you mean you're not sure?
??	I mean, I'm not sure I can work, it really hurts.
??	Aubs, come on, it's, it's not that bad.
??	Look, grab my hand, squeeze my hand.
??	Tighter!
??	Come on!
??	I am squeezing, Tom, god!
??	Well, maybe the bandage needs to be tighter.
??	My fingers are numb, just stop it.
??	Hey, Mom.
??	How ya doin'?
??	Oh, just trying to figure out somethin' for tomorrow.
??	Why don't you take the day to rest?
??	Yeah, sure, take your sick leave.
??	Look, her hand got pinched.
??	Christ Almighty, it's the end of the world?
??	I'm sure it's gonna be fine by tomorrow.
??	Mom, you can take a goddamn day.
??	No, she can't.
??	Yes, she can.
??	You slammed her hand in the hood of a truck!
Tom	This is the worst damn timing.
??	I know, I'm sorry, I'll be fine.
??	You're sorry?
??	I'm going into town.
??	Bright and early tomorrow!
Kathryn	Yes, I know.
??	I will.
??	I promise.
??	She will.
??	She will.
??	Are you goin' to bed?
??	Yeah, are you okay?
??	I should get some water for this cough.
??	I think it's allergies.
??	Well, if it isn't the housewife without a husband.
??	I didn't catch that.
??	Your daddy's cash cow starting to produce?
??	What's that?
??	More drinkin' money?
??	Screw you, Kathryn.
??	Heather, what are you doin'?
??	Your sister's gonna be gone just like your Mom and once some moron falls in love with George, where does that leave you?
??	You got so much potential--
??	You got so much potential, girl.
??	I could teach you how to manage the business.
??	You and Christina could run it together.
??	I've seen how you look at her.
??	You think about it, young lady! (coughs)
??	We got something from Patriot.
??	What is it?
??	It might be our first royalty check.
??	Well?
??	That can't be right.
Heather	Let me see.
??	Wait, that's it?
??	Transportation fees, processing fees. It's not right, I'll give 'em a call.
??	Does that mean there's no gas?
George	I don't know.
??	I don't know, she's callin'.
Heather	Hello, is this the billing department? My family just received a check and, yeah, yes.
??	Last name, Lomack.
Kim	I mean, there has to be a mistake.
Heather	Yeah, we were wondering if you can explain these fees.
??	Or maybe the first one's lower or something.
Heather	No, no, the fees that are on the.
??	Yeah, yes, the ones that are on the check we received today.
??	Yeah, I don't understand what that means, can you.
??	No, our contract didn't state we were paying for...
??	Dad?
??	Dad?
??	What did they say?
??	Well, it is stated in our contract that they can charge us for transportation fees and, um, cleaning fees, and also marketing fees, which, which, which is really blowing my mind.
??	And then to top it all off there's the market price of natural gas or something.
??	You know how natural gas is really cheap right now.
??	So basically we're fucked.
??	Kim.
??	No, this is bullshit and you know it!
??	All that dirt and that noise, and we don't get shit from it!
??	Are you serious?
??	Kim!
??	What?
Heather	Why don't you let me talk to Dad?
??	Assholes!
Heather	Dad.
??	This was supposed to save us.
??	Make it stop, Joe!
??	Make it stop!
??	Kathryn!
??	Kathryn!
??	Hey.
??	Hey, Reesey, hi.
??	Oh, come here, come here, hi.
??	Good morning.
??	Kathryn?
??	Jesus, Mom.
??	Oh my god, you should go to the doctor.
??	It's gonna be fine, just. (coughs)
Heather	I got it!
??	Hello?
??	What's wrong?
??	I'll come right after dinner then.
??	Christina needs me!
??	Kathryn's missing.
Tom	             Mom?
??	It's just a sheet.
??	Please, for Mama, please.
??	Please.
??	A little bit, little bit?
??	Oh.
??	Come on, please, just a little bit.
??	Come on.
??	No.
??	It's really good, see?
??	Oh my.
Heather	Christina?
Christina	Kathryn?
??	Oh, hey.
??	What's goin' on?
??	Are you okay?
??	Okay.
??	Okay, come here.
??	Ow, damn it!
??	What's goin' on?
??	Hey.
??	Come on, come on, come on.
??	Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
??	Dad?
??	Did you fuck my dad?
??	Let go!
??	Mama?
??	Mama?
??	No!
Officer	Tom?
??	I'm gonna need you to...
??	Tom?
??	Tom, back away now!
??	Oh god! (groans)
??	No, no, no, no.
??	No!
??	Daddy!
??	My baby!
??	No, no, no, no.
??	It's okay, baby, it's okay.
??	Okay, hey.
??	I want my baby!
??	Dad, stay there.
??	Ring around the rosey.
??	Heather	Put the gun down!
??	A pocket full of posey.
??	Daddy, please!
??	No!
??	No, no!
??	Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
??	The cows are in the meadow.
??	Reesey?
??	Is that you?
??	The cows are in the meadow huddled altogether.
??	Ashes, they all.
??	Where are you, you little bastard?
??	You, killed him!
??	No.
??	No, no, no, no, no.
Kim	Reese.
??	Kim, Kim!
??	We gotta go.
Christina	Help!
??	No, no!
??	Wait, stop!
??	George	Kim.
??	Dad, I'm staying.
??	When you're safe, call me at the Dolan's. I love you.
??	Die!
??	Whose blood is that?
??	Kim's hurt.
??	Reese is...
??	Kathryn.
??	Tom, too.
??	Have you seen my mom?
??	Listen.
??	Do you hear that?
??	There's nothing.
??	There's no birds, there's no bugs.
Tom	Christina!
??	Tree house?
??	Yeah, okay, okay.
??	Let's take the truck, yeah.
??	Oh god, oh god, oh my god, oh god.
??	It's okay.
??	Okay.
Heather	It wants me to kill you.
??	Oh my god!
??	Oh god.
??	Oh god, oh fuck.
??	Okay, okay, okay.
??	Okay.
??	Fuck!
??	Fuck, fuck, fuck!
??	Oh god, oh god, oh!
??	Oh, no, no, no.
??	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
??	No, no, no, no, fuck you, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
??	Fuck, oh god, oh god.
??	Okay, ah!
??	Okay, ah!
??	Hey, secure that panel!
??	Yeah, thanks.
