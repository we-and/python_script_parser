RUPAUL	Previously on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...It's time to play The Snatch Game!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	How you doing, RuPaul?

THORGY THOR	Hee hee!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Uzo Abu-boo left the stage.

RUPAUL	What do you do for bunions?

ACID BETTY	Well, I was told that you can get them shaved off. I'm about to get that done.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls.

MICHELLE	It's becoming quite predictable to come out in lingerie. Maybe you should switch it up now.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty.

CARSON	I need, like, a nasal, angry Southern voice. And she leans in like she's in your living room.

ACID BETTY	I wish I had you as a coach.

CARSON	Okay.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen, you are the winner of this week's challenge. Naomi Smalls, shantay, you stay. Acid Betty, sashay away.

ROBBIE TURNER	What a day.

KIM CHI	I'm really glad that Naomi's still here. If Naomi had gone home, I would've lost a great friend. And Acid Betty's gone.

NAOMI SMALLS	"Ladies, you have been touched by fierceness. Bob, love you. See Jew in New York."

THORGY THOR	Betty has the most iconic looks, and that's my Brooklyn girl. But she was always just, like, in a bad mood, putting things down. She deserved to go.

NAOMI SMALLS	It was literally the worst feeling I've ever felt. I'm just very embarrassed and disappointed in myself. I let Ru down, and I know that he's disappointed in me, and that's like the worst feeling ever. I'm so scared now. Feel like I have to wear, like, a [bleep] turtleneck that's to the floor.

KIM CHI	Was everything else you brought here a bra and a panty?

NAOMI SMALLS	No.

KIM CHI	Two piece and a biscuit?

NAOMI SMALLS	I mean, I work hard for my body and I love my body.

DERRICK BARRY	I don't think the judges are telling you to be ashamed of your body. I think they just want to see one time where you show them something different.

KIM CHI	Where you wear clothing.

NAOMI SMALLS	The other queens think that what I do doesn't take a lot of effort, and that's totally not true. I put tons of work into my drag aesthetic, so it's frustrating. Well, Bob, congratulations.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

THORGY THOR	Yeah, congratulations, Bob.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I had a lot of fun.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah.

THORGY THOR	My reaction to Bob's win is this... Always. I'm just, like, sick of it.

KIM CHI	I came in a close second, though--they really liked me.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm the first one to win two, I won two! I'm gonna try to get three. Has anyone ever won three before?

THORGY THOR	Bob, shut up.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm really proud of myself and I feel like the other girls are really gunning for me now. They're like, "Oh, you think you all that, bitch?" But I don't mean to come across that way. I'm just having fun. I'm just, like, living my dream, making people laugh, which is me being me.

ROBBIE TURNER	Have you ever played Jenga? That's Bob. Like, slowly he's being built up, but sooner or later, the foundation is gonna crumble and he's gonna take a big fall.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

MAN	RuPaul Drag Race.

RUPAUL	The winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race" receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $,. With extra special guest judges Todrick Hall and Marc Jacobs!

MAN	RuPaul Drag Race. May the best woman, Best woman win.

THORGY THOR	(chuckling)

DERRICK BARRY	Now that we're in the top seven, I have no idea who could go home next. You can have your ugly purse back.

THORGY THOR	Damn.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ooh, girl! Girl!

RUPAUL	She done already done had herses! My queens, are you a friend of Dorothy's, or just plain wicked? Just click your tongue and repeat after me. There's no place like "Drag Race." (clicks tongue)

RUPAUL	Okay? Okay? Hello, hello, hello!

RUPAUL	We've got company. Close the door behind you. What you think this is? Ladies, say hello to Marc Snetiker. Snetiker, please.

RUPAUL	He's a writer with "Entertainment Weekly."

ROBBIE TURNER	Oh.

MARC	I'm so excited to be here, Ru. Our "EW" readers love to read the "Drag Race" recaps every week.

RUPAUL	Well, I'm glad you brought up reading. Because in the great tradition of "Paris Is Burning"...

RUPAUL	The library is about to be open, darling.

RUPAUL	Because reading is what?

ALL	Fundamental!
RUPAUL	That's right. First up, Chi Chi DeVayne. Come on down, honey.


KIM CHI	Chi Chi!

RUPAUL	Yeah!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	All right, Thorgy Thor. Girl, I love you so much, I don't know whether to give you a hug or put some change in a cup.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Bob The Drag Queen. You may be from New York, honey, but those feet are still from Mississippi.

KIM CHI	Love it. Chi Chi, your drag is just like turkey neck. Cheap, and no one wants it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Wow.

KIM CHI	Naomi Smalls. Your wardrobe reminds me of a legendary "Drag Race" queen. Nicole Paige Brooks.

MARC	Nice.

RUPAUL	Shade! Who knew that was lurking underneath that...

ROBBIE TURNER	We all knew.

NAOMI SMALLS	We all knew.

THORGY THOR	Simple. I mean Derrick. I mean Britney. You know, you are pretty attractive. I'd hit that baby one more time.

THORGY THOR	Bob. Please shut up.

DERRICK BARRY	Naomi. No one knows whether to call you "Ny-omi" or "Nay-omi," but judging from your runway looks, no one's gonna be calling you at all.

DERRICK BARRY	Bob The Drag Queen. I had no idea that there are different shades of ashy.

ROBBIE TURNER	Kim Chi. You are stomping for the gods on the runway.

ROBBIE TURNER	I just wish your drag would get raptured.

ROBBIE TURNER	Naomi. I'm gonna give you some advice, darling. No one's gonna take you seriously if you were born after Windows  came out.

NAOMI SMALLS	Robbie Turner, we know you're a vintage queen, but do you have to smell like mothballs too?

ROBBIE TURNER	Oh, [bleep] off.

NAOMI SMALLS	Derrick Barry. You say it takes you an hour to do your face. Why does it look like five minutes?

DERRICK BARRY	Beauty.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It is a known fact that Derrick Barry is not very smart. When she heard "Britney Spears," she said, "Does she? I prefer fencing."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It is very hard to have an intelligent conversation with Derrick Barry. The only thing harder is Robbie Turner's wig lines.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Rob-bie Turn-ter! I know you're a huge fan of classic movies and television. May I recommend one of my favorite classic TV shows? "Flipper."

RUPAUL	Oh, my goodness! Y'all went in deep!

MARC	I feel like I'm a lot shadier just by being here.

MARC	The winner of today's mini-challenge...is Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

THORGY THOR	Bob just won, again. Ugh.

RUPAUL	You've won jewels valued at $, from Fierce Drag Jewels.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, wow!

RUPAUL	And to see more reads, go to logotv.com. Let's say good-bye to Marc, everybody!

ALL	Bye, Marc!

RUPAUL	Ladies, since you love reading so much, I want to share with you my favorite book of all time, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."

RUPAUL	This week's maxi-challenge is your chance to strut your stuff down the yellow brick road. But you won't be doing it alone. Please welcome some "Drag Race" super fans.

RUPAUL	The cast of Lifetime TV's "Little Women: LA." Say hello to... And last but not least... Now, for this makeover challenge, you need to create original drag couture for you and your partner inspired by one of the characters in "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz." #WizardsofDrag.

RUPAUL	Little women of LA, you choose the queen you want to be your partner. Briana, which character do you have?

BRIANA	I have the Wicked Witch, and I actually picked Kim Chi. (chuckles) Hi!

KIM CHI	Hi!

BRITTNEY	I have the citizen of Emerald City, and the queen I picked is Thorgy Thor.

THORGY THOR	Whoo!

CHRISTY	I have the Cowardly Lion, and the queen I picked is Robbie Turner.

ROBBIE TURNER	Yes!

ELENA	I'm gonna be Glinda the Good Witch, because I'm good, and sometimes I'm a witch.

ELENA	And I'll take Bob The Drag Queen.

TERRA	I have Tin Woodman, and I am % going with Mr. Derrick Barry!

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo! I love Terra! I've met Terra in the past, and she impersonates Britney. She's Mini-Britney. It's a perfect match.
JASMINE	I have the Scarecrow, and I'm taking Naomi Smalls.

RUPAUL	Okay.

NAOMI SMALLS	How are you?

JASMINE	Hello.

TONYA	I am Dorothy. And I have Chi Chi!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I love you!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	You don't play no games, baby. I watch you all the time.

RUPAUL	Now, there should be a strong drag family resemblance. So to help you with your makeovers, you'll be using the wonderful products provided by Anastasia of Beverly Hills. Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.

RUPAUL	Coming up...

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I am nervous! You know you guys are all [bleep] gunning for me to lose.

ROBBIE TURNER	We just want you to trip and fall, that's all.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ooh, hoo, hoo!

ROBBIE TURNER	Too real?

WOMAN	(laughs)
	
WOMAN	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	Ooh, these are cool!

BRITTNEY	Yeah!

THORGY THOR	This week's maxi-challenge is to make over the cast of "Little Women: LA," inspired by the characters of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."

JASMINE	So, I'm open to anything, because I love fashion, and makeup, and I'm a hair stylist.

NAOMI SMALLS	Me too. Yeah.

JASMINE	Are you? Whoo! This is gonna be bomb.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm so excited I get Jasmine, because she's gorgeous, and I'm gorgeous, and--Like, you literally just, like, are, like, posed like that.
JASMINE	Oh, like...

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah.

JASMINE	Like a Scarecrow 'cause they're very still.

NAOMI SMALLS	Exactly.

JASMINE	Oh, shoot!

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm excited that we get to do some designing. I could seriously look at fashion magazines from the time Barnes & Noble opens to the time Barnes & Noble closes. I really want to show the girls that I'm not just a walking bra and panty and I'm talented. (chuckles)

ROBBIE TURNER	So tell me, like, what's your personal style like?

CHRISTY	It's very vintage.

ROBBIE TURNER	Me too.

CHRISTY	My wedding was a s vintage wedding dress.

ROBBIE TURNER	Fabulous! I love that.

CHRISTY	Yeah.

ROBBIE TURNER	So, the Cowardly Lion. We're gonna make, you know, a cute little dress or maybe a leotard or I don't know. I'm thinking.

CHRISTY	You have a big challenge.

ROBBIE TURNER	I do have a big challenge, yeah.

THORGY THOR	Oh, Robbie. I agree with Christy. I think he's gonna have a challenge, because based on his poodle challenge a couple episodes ago, Robbie's not the best at construction, and especially with somebody much smaller.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	So how do you fit into your group? 'Cause here's the thing. They're sick of me winning all the time, so they're all like, "Ooh, Bob wins everything. Everyone loves Bob."

ELENA	In the first season of the show, there was a photo shoot that we did. And the photographer was giving me all of his attention. Terra--

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Which one's Terra?

ELENA	The bitchy one.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	The one right here?

ELENA	Yeah. She was really bitter.

TERRA	I can hear you.

ELENA	So I know how you feel.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I mean, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous. I don't know if there's anyone in "The Wizard of Oz" more the opposite of who I am than Glinda the Good Witch. And I think, honestly, a lot of the girls want to see me do bad. I am nervous!

ROBBIE TURNER	Why?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You know you guys are all [bleep] gunning for me to lose.

ROBBIE TURNER	Well, of course we are. We just want you to trip and fall, that's all.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ooh, hoo, hoo!

ROBBIE TURNER	Sometimes it's funny to watch other people, like, squirm. Especially Bob. Too real?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Our resources are very limited.

ELENA	You know, in like, "Master Chef" competition, they always give each other mustard and honey.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Girl this ain't "Master Chef," honey. They hate me. They're not gonna give me their stuff. These hoes are evil.

TONYA	You're not too worried about the cut and sew, right?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm just worried about being efficient. I'm feeling a little pressured about the outfits today because so far the judges seem to not like my style. I keep saying that I'm like the broke queen, you know what I mean? I just cannot get out of my head.

TONYA	See, you can't do that. Don't even claim that. Don't even have that energy. It ain't no "if." It ain't "I'm trying," or "I can't." No. "I am," and "I'm doing it." 'Cause if I could do it, you sure could do it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Mm-hmm.

TONYA	I didn't let my height to get in my way of my dreams. Don't think small.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	The lesson in "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" for Dorothy is that she's searching for something that she already has, so maybe I have everything I need and I am a real-life Dorothy.

TONYA	Whatever you do, I'ma wear it, strut it, and be confident in it, okay? 'Cause you know that's how I roll.

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello!

BRITTNEY	Hi!

THORGY THOR	Hello!

DERRICK BARRY	Hello!

RUPAUL	Hi, Kim Chi. Hi, Briana.

KIM CHI	Hi, Ru.

BRIANA	Hello.

RUPAUL	Now, Kim Chi, you're known for really high concept, Leigh Bowery style.

KIM CHI	Yeah.

RUPAUL	How does that translate to a little person?

KIM CHI	Well, I ask her, like, what are some of your style inspirations? And she said Jessica Rabbit and...

BRIANA	Betty Boop.

KIM CHI	Cartoon makeup is what I love doing, so it's a match made in heaven.

RUPAUL	Because of your knowledge of design, there are high expectations. Does that make you nervous?

KIM CHI	It doesn't make me nervous, 'cause I feel like the first challenge, I won, and then I was in the bottom right after that and I've been safe since, so I want to knock this one out of the park.

RUPAUL	Good, good. I'm looking forward to this.

KIM CHI	All right. I'll not let you down.

RUPAUL	All right, kids. Hey, guys.

THORGY THOR	Hi, Ru. How are you?

RUPAUL	Hi, Brittney.

BRITTNEY	Hi!

RUPAUL	Now, Brittney, have you ever been made over before?

BRITTNEY	No, I have never, but I was on tour with Miley Cyrus...

RUPAUL	Miley Cyrus?

BRITTNEY	Yeah! She thought of the outfits, and she made everything. So we had cones coming from our boobs, all crazy stuff.

RUPAUL	Wow. Thorgy, do you have any sketches or anything?

THORGY THOR	Actually, I just--that was the stage we just got to.

RUPAUL	Okay. All right. Time is running out.

THORGY THOR	I'm feeling the pressure.

RUPAUL	All right, Thorgy.

THORGY THOR	Thanks a lot, Ru.

RUPAUL	Thanks, Brittney.

BRITTNEY	Thank you.

THORGY THOR	Cool.

RUPAUL	Hello!

TERRA	Hi.

RUPAUL	So what do you have planned?

DERRICK BARRY	Well, we are the Tin Woman, and the Tin "Whoa, Man!"

RUPAUL	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	So I was thinking of creating elements that can go onto a body suit or something like that.

RUPAUL	That's great, but haven't you done that before? Wearing a body suit or a bathing suit, and then putting something on top of it? We're looking for couture, something inspired by the Tin Woodsman, so take it from there.

TERRA	I don't handle losing very well, so I will give this .

RUPAUL	Well, you say that while you have a hatchet in your hand. That kind of scares me.

RUPAUL	All right, well, I'm gonna let you get to it.

DERRICK	(sighs) Now I have to rethink ideas. That really scares me. Oh, God.

RUPAUL	All right, ladies, gather round. Gather round, ladies. Now tomorrow, in addition to your runway presentation, I want each duo to perform a dreamy interpretive dance set in a poppy field. Of course. (laughs) Ladies, good luck, and don't [bleep] it up.

KIM CHI	This challenge just went from my dream to my biggest nightmare. (pretends to cry)

RUPAUL	Coming up...

NAOMI SMALLS	I have no idea what the [bleep] we're supposed to do. What's interpretive dance?

JASMINE	Uh...

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm not wearing any makeup at all.

PRODUCER	 minutes!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's not possible. It's literally not possible.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Girl, this might be your time.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	This week's maxi-challenge is makeovers for the cast of "Little Women: LA."

TERRA	They're looking like they're getting creative over there.

DERRICK BARRY	Which one? Oh, the Tin Man?

TERRA	Mm-hmm.

NAOMI SMALLS	I wouldn't be too worried about Derrick.

KIM CHI	All right, let's do it.

BRIANA	Okay.

KIM CHI	We're sleeping.

BRIANA	Are we gonna lay down?

KIM CHI	Yeah.

BRIANA	This whole time?

KIM CHI	Yeah. It's finally time to rehearse our interpretive dance routine. To ask the question "Do I understand interpretive dance?" is to ask "Do I know the entire pi formula?" And the answer is no.

TERRA	I woke up with a nightmare. His face looks like he's going for a dental checkup.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, my God. Terra, you belong here with us.

TERRA	(laughs)

KIM CHI	Pow!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Girl, what the hell are you doing? Like, she's just slapping her little lady around.

KIM CHI	 [bleep] bitch!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	You gonna get a charge, girl. You beating up on a little lady.

KIM CHI	Oh!

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm guessing we should just play up the fact that we're scarecrows.

JASMINE	Okay.

NAOMI SMALLS	And maybe we can, like, do like a cross, like...

JASMINE	Should I go in front of you?

NAOMI SMALLS	Sure.

JASMINE	And then it looks like you put that leg out.

NAOMI SMALLS	I don't know what to do. What's interpretive dance?

JASMINE	Uh...

TONYA	Uh oh. The Scarecrow people.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Are they practicing? What they doing?

TONYA	No, they both staring at each other, trying to figure it out.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	He ain't no choreographer. He don't dance. He was in the bottom last week.

TONYA	Uh oh.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	This is his time to, like, step it up.

NAOMI SMALLS	I have no idea what the [bleep] we're supposed to do.

TONYA	"What do you think?" "What do you think?" "What do you think?"

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	"What do you think?"

TONYA	Y'all better stop thinking and start doing. (laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I love you.

ROBBIE TURNER	Why is this machine being a dick?

ROBBIE TURNER	Oh, my God. Do you want to see something completely insane?

KIM CHI	(gasps) What the [bleep]? Why did you sew it like this? I don't even know how you did this.

ROBBIE TURNER	No, I don't either. Isn't that bizarre? Apparently this fabric cannot be sewn on. So we've gone from a beautiful, regal cape, to making bustles to give us sort of a regal flair. I want to scream. My brain just exploded.

ELENA	(screams) Oh, [bleep]!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yes, indeed. Our little hot glue skirt turned out good.

TONYA	(laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm pretty much done. I have a complete product and I'm feeling good today.

TONYA	This working?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yes, ma'am.

TONYA	It's not gathering?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm right on track.

TONYA	Okay.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah, it's done.

DERRICK BARRY	What? We're all working, and she's done. Do something more to your outfit. Because it doesn't look that great.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Come on, Disco Dorothy.

TONYA	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	I almost want to go over there, like, "Hello?" You have, like, a challenge to do."

BRITTNEY	(hums)

THORGY THOR	Somebody in this competition should not be wasting their time but using every single second to create every single thing perfect.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh, I'm ready for that Chipotle.

THORGY THOR	Needless to say, I was pissed off.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I want to see "Clueless" tonight.

THORGY THOR	Chi Chi is the next to go. She's not ready for this competition.

KIM CHI	Let's do it!

BRIANA	Oh, my goodness.

KIM CHI	Let's throw this hideous purse away.

BRIANA	I know.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Did you just throw Purse Purse? How dare you?

NAOMI SMALLS	We're gonna have, like, a [bleep] blast. We just have to, like, kill the runway. Like, we have to kill it.

JASMINE	Got it.

ROBBIE TURNER	Oh, Lord. Bob, how much do you have to do still?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Way too much.

ELENA	I thought you were almost done yesterday.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I was. My outfit fell apart.

ROBBIE TURNER	He had to remake a new outfit.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	So I get to the workroom this morning, and try on my couture look, and the zipper just like flies off. It falls apart, basically. Like, it is just non-functional. So I need to make a new outfit. And on top of that, I still have to do my makeup, I have to do Elena's makeup. I'm like F-M-L. Oh, my God. This is madness.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	So do you kind of find it hard being a, you know, a little person?

TONYA	It was hard.

TERRA	I am made fun of all the time.

JASMINE	I get personally offended by the word "midget." Because "midget" doesn't necessarily mean, like, a person.

NAOMI	Mm-hmm.

JASMINE	It just means something small. It's such a derogatory, ugly word. It, like, makes me cringe when I hear it.

DERRICK BARRY	Do you think it's because people are just afraid of what they don't know?

TERRA	Yeah.

JASMINE	You know what trips me out? Is if I'm literally at the mall walking, and somebody's like, "Oh, my gosh! Look at that midget!" I'm like, "Are you serious?"

NAOMI SMALLS	People have a long way to come.

JASMINE	Yeah.

TERRA	I think that's why I feel so comfortable around gay people, 'cause they get how I feel because, you know, they get treated the same way.

DERRICK BARRY	Right, exactly. You can't stop being the height that you are, you know?

TERRA	Yeah.

DERRICK BARRY	It's like who you are.

TERRA	And you love who you love.

DERRICK BARRY	Right. At the end of the day, everybody just wants to be loved. Everybody just wants to fit in.

TERRA	Exactly.

TONYA	My confidence didn't really build until I had a child.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	So you could be strong for your baby.

TONYA	Yes, and I had to help her deal with it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Mm-hmm.

TONYA	I had to be an example. She's average height, and so I was really hard on her, 'cause I had to gain that respect.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah.

TONYA	At an early age, because I knew by the time she was seven or eight, she was gonna be taller than me. And I refused to be on somebody's talk show saying "My kid is whooping my ass."
CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah. (laughs)

TONYA	That was not gonna happen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There we go. Oh, my God. I don't know how I'm gonna get any of this--any of my [bleep] done. So Elena's done, but then I look at myself in the mirror and I'm like, "Oh, my God, I don't have time to get myself pretty." Okay, face. Face, face, face. I'm not wearing any makeup at all.

PRODUCER	 minutes!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's not possible. It's literally not possible. God damn it.

DERRICK BARRY	Relax. I don't know what Bob is thinking. We're all ready, so I don't know how he's gonna throw it--Well, I do know how he's gonna throw his look together, 'cause that's just what Bob does. But now he really has no look. The judges will finally read him for something. Please read Bob.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Next time we hang out, Elena, it'll be under much less stressful circumstances.

ELENA	I hope so.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I don't know, girl. I don't know. Girl, this might be your time.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Cover girl, Put the bass in your walk. Head to toe, let your whole body talk.

RUPAUL	And what?

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "RuPaul's Drag Race." Michelle Visage.

MICHELLE	My darling, there's no place like home.

RUPAUL	He's back! Ross Matthews.

ROSS	I'm so excited, I'm clicking my heels under the table, honey. (laughs)

RUPAUL	And the world's biggest "Oz" fan, Todrick Hall.

TODRICK	Ru, my life has been black and white until now, and now all I see is amazing color.

RUPAUL	Oh, you gonna play the race card?

RUPAUL	And fashion's coolest designer, and a supporter of the drag arts, Marc Jacobs is here.

MARC	Can't be happier being somewhere over the rainbow with you.

RUPAUL	Thank you, darling. It's a joy to have you here with us.

MARC	Thank you.

RUPAUL	This week, we challenged our queens to drag up the cast of "Little Women: LA." And tonight, they're ready to ease on down the runway. Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.

RUPAUL	The realness.

RUPAUL	First up, serving Dorothy couture, Chi Chi and Ti Ti DeVayne.

MICHELLE	Come on, Disco Dorothy.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	We look good. I mean, you can't go wrong when you're serving up Nubian Dorothy realness.

RUPAUL	Come through, Dorothy.

MICHELLE	Zbornak?

RUPAUL	Zbornak, yes. Serving Glinda the Good Witch couture is Bob The Drag Queen and Rob The Faux Queen. Glinda Evangelista! (laughter)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm really shocked that I dressed as fast as I did, but we look good. Me and Rob The Faux Queen are, like, living our dreams on the runway.

MICHELLE	I think I wore that outfit to prom.

MARC	I think I wore that outfit to prom.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Serving Scarecrow couture, Naomi Smalls and Jazzy Jems.

TODRICK	I ain't scared of her.

MARC	(laughs)

TODRICK	Very Oz-mopolitan.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm trying to give the judges a different side of Naomi. Vivienne Westwood meets Scarecrow meets Vidal Sassoon and we look amazing.

RUPAUL	Thank God her pussy's not on fire.

ROSS	We're all eating crow now.

MICHELLE	We are.

RUPAUL	Serving Tin Woodman couture, Terra and Derrick Barry.

ROSS	She brought her own lube!

RUPAUL	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	I knew that I wanted to make the Tin Woodman sexy, so we're showing leg, we're showing body.

RUPAUL	Ooh, girl, you better axe somebody.

ROSS	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Not a girl, not yet a tin woman.

RUPAUL	Serving Cowardly Lion couture, Robbie and Hedda Turner. Nobody mention Cecil.

MICHELLE	(laughs loudly)

ROBBIE TURNER	Rowr! Christy and I, we are giving you king of the forest. Serving courage and fearfulness and elegance.

RUPAUL	This is the mane event.

ROSS	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Paws up.

RUPAUL	Serving Citizen of Emerald City couture, Thorgy Thor and Thorgeous. I think it's : in the Emerald City.

THORGY	We're giving you artistic Fifth Avenue meets "Fifth Element." Everyone wants to be us and everyone wants to know where we purchased these fabulous green outfits.

MARC	Always been seen in emerald green.

RUPAUL	Oh! Wow! Serving Wicked Witch couture, Kim Chi and Miso Chi. You know, the Chi dynasty.

TODRICK	(laughs)

KIM CHI	My concept for this runway is Isabella Blow going to a funeral realness. And Briana is definitely selling the garment. She's feeling all sorts of fantasy.

MARC	Water won't melt them.

RUPAUL	Now it's time for "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" dream sequence.

RUPAUL	Night after night, I close my eyes and I wonder when the sun will rise. Day by day, I live my life. And I try my best to do what's right. A moment of hope is all I need to keep me moving on through the dark, till I see what's left to be revealed to me. If I dream everything I wanna be. If I dream all the possibilities. If you just believe in your wildest dreams, they will come true

RUPAUL	Coming up...Who deserves to go back to Kansas?

KIM CHI	People like Chi Chi piss me off.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome, ladies. It's time for the judges' critiques. First up, Chi Chi and Ti Ti DeVayne.

MARC	I thought your performance was really sweet. And the two of you look really pretty. But I would like to see t all pushed further.

MICHELLE	I have something to ask you. I know you're not a breast drag queen. Do you ever consider contouring?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yes, I tried to kind of contour tonight.

MICHELLE	With what, translucent powder, girl?

MICHELLE	Because your waist is not cinched. We gotta balance out the man.

RUPAUL	Next up, Bob The Drag Queen--not to be confused with Bob The Court Reporter--and Rob The Faux Queen.

ROSS	Elena, do you feel gorgeous?

ELENA	Yeah. I feel like I'm in "Hunger Games."

ROSS	Totally. Well, I thought you really shone tonight, and, Bob, I don't think that's good for you. Elena looks inspired by the Good Witch, and yours, I feel like I could get that in a mall.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I guess I thought that was the challenge. I was really wanting to make sure that Elena felt like a beautiful goddess, you know what I mean?

ROSS	But you're the one competing.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Okay.

RUPAUL	Next up, Naomi Smalls and Jazzy Jems.

ROSS	Everyone should take a look at Naomi right now. This is how you win this competition.

MARC	Yeah, you did an amazing job. I mean, it just gave me Scarecrow in the most gorgeous way. The look, the details, the makeup. I just thought it was perfection.

TODRICK	And you could not have asked for a better partner--Jasmine, with these straw leg warmers on.

TODRICK	It was just phenomenal.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Next up, Derrick and Terra Barry.

MICHELLE	It just looks so homemade, in the worst way.

DERRICK BARRY	Uh, I'm not a seamstress, but I did sew everything on here.

MICHELLE	It's a piece of fabric. We're, like, pretty far in to the competition now. You have to give us more. That is not a Britney reference.

TODRICK	I have watched you in Vegas. I know what you're capable of, and it just sort of saddens me because you're better than what you just did up there.

RUPAUL	Next up, Robbie and Hedda Turner.

MICHELLE	I literally don't even know what to make out of what you're wearing. Bustles can be flattering when they're on a big gown. This looks like just a bunch of ruched up fabric stuck--And we have to work on that hairline.

ROBBIE TURNER	I guess I'm a little more old school. I come from big ol' Christian hair women.

MICHELLE	Even Jan Crouch found a way to blend.

ROBBIE TURNER	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Robbie! We're at this point now. It's, like, so frustrating, because you are so talented and all we want is for you to bring it. And we're missing it.

RUPAUL	All right, Kim Chi and Miso Chi.

MARC	I got a Kimbra, Feller, "Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black" sort of vibe, and the look was fantastic.

MICHELLE	I loved the beginning runway walk, even though it was a little wobbly. You had a complete concept. Great job tonight.

RUPAUL	Next up, Thorgy Thor and Thorgeous.

MARC	What I was charmed by, really, was when you eased on down the road into your dance moves.


ROSS	Your look tonight, I thought it was cohesive, but it didn't wow me. I'm not gonna remember in a few weeks, driving in traffic, thinking "Oh, God, remember that look?" You know?

RUPAUL	Ladies, one final question: who deserves to click their heels and go back to Kansas? Starting with Chi hi DeVayne.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(blows out air) I'm sorry, Derrick, but your outfit to me, was just... a train wreck.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Based off this challenge, I would pick Derrick as well.

RUPAUL	Naomi.

NAOMI SMALLS	Based on execution, I would probably say Derrick's too.

RUPAUL	Derrick.

DERRICK BARRY	Well, I would say all three that said me, but I know I have to pick one. I would say Chi Chi's. It's hot-glued together. It's cut fabric with no detail.

RUPAUL	What say you, Robbie Turner?

ROBBIE TURNER	Chi Chi's didn't scream "Dorothy" to me.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi?

KIM CHI	I love her, but I'm going to say Chi Chi, only because yesterday, when everyone was just working hard, she was just sitting there, and that was a time that she could have spent on her outfit. Sorry.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor, you're up.

THORGY THOR	Kim Chi, you literally said every word that I was gonna say. I think in this competition you have to apply every single second and I'm here to win, so people like Chi Chi piss me off.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yes, I did have extra time, because I did hot glue my outfit, but I did what was in my range of doing. But that's how they feel, so I respect y'all's opinion.

RUPAUL	All right, I think we've heard enough, ladies. While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate. Just between us friends of Dorothy, what do you think? Chi Chi DeVayne.

MARC	I really didn't care about the hot glue gun conspiracy, issue, whatever.

MARC	Like...

MICHELLE	Gluegate!

MARC	You know, there's a lot of hot glue gunning going on, even at the Met Ball.

ROSS	Really?

MARC	I don't want to name names, but...

ROSS	Please name names!

RUPAUL	Please do!

MICHELLE	Who's mad at a hot glue gun? BenDeLaCreme won a fashion challenge with a hot glued dress.

ROSS	But here's the deal: that outfit, at this point, is nowhere near good enough.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

ROSS	Well, Bob The Drag Queen made the biggest mistake you can make in show business: you don't let someone outshine you!

MICHELLE	But Elena looked beautiful, so he did his job there.

ROSS	I know that that was part of the challenge, but I wasn't looking at Bob The Drag Queen tonight. I was looking at Elena.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls.

MICHELLE	Told her last week I was getting bored of seeing her in underwear, so when she came out tonight the way she did with something creative, it was amazing.

MARC	The look, from head to toe, was flawless. The choreography was amazing.

TODRICK	I could not have been more proud, and I don't even know her.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	I'm banging my head against the wall with Derrick because you're just giving me a bathing suit with something wrapped around your waist, again. And putting two horse penises on your shoulders...

RUPAUL	Oh!

MARC	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Doesn't change it.

TODRICK	I cannot.

MICHELLE	She's amazing as Britney. And we still haven't gotten past this, episode six!

RUPAUL	I know that Britney's frustrated.

ROSS	She seems lost to me.

MICHELLE	You said "Britney." Did you say "Britney"?

RUPAUL	I sure did, yeah.


ROSS	That's hilarious.

MICHELLE	But that's the point.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turn-ter.

ROSS	Yes, we've seen way better looks before. even this hair thing done better by Kim Chi in episode one, but I just can't make myself hate it. I would be so angry to see Robbie go home.

MICHELLE	But how many times is he gonna be excused? She is holding herself back. You saw it in the acting challenge and you're seeing it again.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi.

MARC	I loved the look, but the performance was a little out there. Didn't understand the laying of the brooms...

MARC	The collecting of the brooms. But, you know...

RUPAUL	The trading of the brooms.

MARC	The trading of the brooms. Returning of the brooms.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

MICHELLE	Believe it or not, kids, this is scaled back for Thorgy. She edited, 'cause she was much plainer.

MARC	I wasn't getting drag queen glamour. And the wigs I thought were a St. Patrick's Day markdown sort of situation.

TODRICK	I didn't hate the Grinch pubes wig that she came out with.

TODRICK	I liked it.

MICHELLE	She wasn't the best of the night, and she wasn't the worst. I...

RUPAUL	Silence! I have made my decision. Bring back my girls... and Toto too! (laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome back, ladies. I've made some decisions. Thorgy Thor. You're safe.

THORGY THOR	Thank you.

WOMAN	Oh!

RUPAUL	Kim Chi. Your witch couture slayed the house down. You're safe.

KIM CHI	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls. This week, you spun straw into gold. Condragulations, you are the winner of this week's challenge.

RUPAUL	You and Jasmine have each won $, worth of spa services from The Spa on Rodeo.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you.

JASMINE	Awesome.

NAOMI SMALLS	It feels amazing that the legendary RuPaul is saying my name in a positive way. I am freaking out.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen. Your Glinda was not bewitching. You are safe.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you. Thank you. (exhales)

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry. Your tin couture was rusted. I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination. Robbie Turner. This week you are not queen of the forest. Chi Chi DeVayne, your Disco Dorothy did not inspire oohs or ahhs. Robbie Turner. I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.

ROBBIE TURNER	I'm pissed off. Like, this is so unfair.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi. You are safe. You may join the other girls.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Thank y'all so much.

TONYA	Yes!

ROBBIE TURNER	I guess I was hoping for a miracle. Like they were gonna pluck Chi Chi and put her back in the bottom two where she belongs. [bleep].

RUPAUL	Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come...

RUPAUL	For you to lip-synch for your life. (voice echoes)

DERRICK BARRY	This is it--I'm gonna have to take Robbie down. I love her, but I will send her home.

RUPAUL	Good luck... and don't [bleep] it up.

CHARLI XCX	I got this feeling on the summer day When you were gone. I crashed my car into the bridge I watched, I let it burn. I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs. I crashed my car into the bridge. I don't care. I love it. I don't care. You're on a different road.

DERRICK BARRY	I feel confident. I feel powerful. I feel like I am killing this performance.

CHARLI XCX	You're so damn hard to please. We gotta kill this switch.

ROBBIE TURNER	I'm nailing it. Connect with my audience. Make 'em laugh. Make them want more. And then don't give it to them.

CHARLIE XCX	I don't care. I love it. I don't care.

WOMAN	(cheering)

CHARLIE XCX	I love it, I love it. I don't care. I love it. I don't care. I love it, I love it.
	
WOMAN	Whoo! That's awesome!

DERRICK BARRY	(sighs)

RUPAUL	Ladies, I've made my decision.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry, shantay, you stay.

DERRICK BARRY	(exhales) (sobbing) I'm sorry. This is the most emotional roller coaster I've ever been on. I'm so outside of my comfort zone here, and it just crumbled down on me today because I had put myself in a Britney box. And I'm doing my best to get out of that, so thank you for allowing me to continue to make it happen.

RUPAUL	Thank you.

DERRICK BARRY	(sniffles) May I leave the stage now?

RUPAUL	(inhales deeply) Yes.

DERRICK BARRY	Thank you all.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turner, I'm reminded of a quote from "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz." "Now I know I've got a heart because it's breaking." Now... sashay away.

ROBBIE TURNER	Thank you, guys, so much. Love you. Love you. Love you. Love you. Mwah! Good morning. Guess right now I think still a little stunned. I'll probably get back to Seattle and be like, "Woe is me," and eat some peaches and then I'll be okay. Oh, [bleep].

RUPAUL	Top six! Condragulations. Remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else? Can I get a "amen" up in here, y'all?

ALL	Amen!

RUPAUL.	All right. Now let the music play.

RUPAUL	Die tomorrow, live tonight. Die tomorrow, live tonight. Die tomorrow, live tonight.
