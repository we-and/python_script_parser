THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching.? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Sir Topham Hatt and Skiff are stranded in a cove and waiting to be rescued. Sir Topham Hatt doesn't look quite himself today, does he?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Ahh, now I can see why. He's not wearing his famous top hat! Yes, someone else, or something else seems to be wearing it instead of him!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Who or what was wearing Sir Topham Hatt's hat? Was it a rock? Was it a goat? Or was it Skiff?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Goodness me! A rock was wearing the hat. A rock with a smiley face painted on it.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Ahh, that's better. Now Sir Topham Hatt looks like his usual self again! (Laughs)

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray! That was fun. Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Goodness! Thomas is in a hurry today. And it looks like he's travelling on the wrong track! Look out Thomas!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Luckily someone is changing those points, so Thomas can swap tracks and avoid an accident.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Phew! Now that was close!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Who changed the points for Thomas? Was it his Driver? Was it Sir Topham Hatt? Or was it the Signalman?

THE EARL OF SODOR	The Signalman changed the points. He pulled levers which moved the rails and allowed Thomas to change tracks. Splendid!

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Looks Like this Signalman needs a bit of a rest!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh, jolly well done for playing! I look forward to seeing you again next time. Goodbye!
