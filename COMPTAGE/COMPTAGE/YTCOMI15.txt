storyteller	ever since thomas the tank engine arrived on the island of sodor, he had always wanted to see the world.
storyteller	and one day...
storyteller	...he saw his chance!
storyteller	thomas & friends! really useful around the world!
storyteller	thomas goes to india!
storyteller	thomas was collecting a shipment of brightly coloured indian fabrics when he saw a very strange-looking engine.
storyteller	"excuse me? do you know you've got something on your face?" said thomas.
storyteller	"of course i do!" laughed the other engine, whose name was rajinder. "brilliant, isn't it?"
storyteller	thomas had never, ever seen an engine like rajinder before.
storyteller	on the way to his next stop, thomas saw another extraordinary-looking engine!
storyteller	an engine... with wings!
storyteller	the engine was called abir. and she had a very loud horn!
storyteller	and, at the next station, thomas saw yet another engine.
storyteller	"hello," said thomas. "i like your livery. it's very... strange."
storyteller	"i am striped like a bengal tiger!" said khuram – the striped engine. "the bengal tiger is our national animal. it is found only in india. so it may be strange to you – but not to us!"
storyteller	"i didn't mean to upset you!" said thomas. "i like your stripes!"
storyteller	when thomas arrived at his final destination, he was surprised to see rajinder, abir and khuram already there. "hello, thomas!" they chorused.
storyteller	"you all look so unusual," said thomas.
storyteller	"but here in india," said rajinder, "it is you who looks unusual!"
storyteller	"yes!" said abir. "you are the odd one out!"
storyteller	"because today is the day of the black beauty contest," said khuram. "where engines are judged on their special decorations!"
storyteller	thomas thought it was too late for him to join in...
storyteller	...but his new friends had an idea!
storyteller	"this is brilliant!" said thomas. "i look different from usual... and i fit right in!"
