Claire	Hi, Sarah? 

Sarah	Yes.

Claire	Hi, I'm Claire. Nice to meet you. 

Sarah	Nice to meet you.

Claire	Right this way. 

Claire	What's the plan?

Sarah	I need a color touch-up, as you can see, and a trim. 

Claire	Okay, sounds good. Can I get you something to drink? Water, wine? 

Sarah	Oh my gosh, a glass of wine sounds amazing. Yes, red. 

Claire	I'll be right back with that and the color. 

Claire	Here you go. 

Sarah	Oh, thank you. 

Claire	Are you in town for work? 

Sarah	Yeah, is it that obvious I'm not from around here? 

Claire	No.

Claire	Do you travel a lot for work? 

Sarah	Yeah.

Claire	Must be exciting.

Sarah	It's not as luxurious as it seems and I miss my family. 

Claire	Family?

Sarah	Yep. Husband and a -year-old. 

Claire	That's sweet. 

Sarah	Sometimes I wonder if I hate being gone so much because he seems so fine with it. I'm obsolete.

Claire	I'm sure that's not true. Moms are moms. 

Sarah	I guess, even when we can't be. 

Claire	What do you do? 

Sarah	Graphic design. 

Claire	Really? Didn't think that was a job you had to travel for, seems like a job you could just do at home. I don't know anything about it though, really.

Sarah	Well, you mostly can but I prefer to meet bigger clients face-to-face. You make a better connection when you can look them in the eye.

Sarah	I wish my hair would do that, but we all want what we don't have. 

Claire	That's certainly true. 

Sarah	Oh, do you mind if I get this? It's my husband. 

Claire	Not at all.

Sarah	Hey babe, what's up? How's David? Well, you can tell him I'll be home this weekend and it better be done by then.

Claire	Have a good night. 

Sarah	Okay, talk to you tomorrow. Love you too. Bye. 

Sarah	Am I keeping you late? I feel bad. 

Claire	Oh, no. I work late most week nights, it seems to be my most valuable time. 

Sarah	Oh, sorry, I ... Well, I met a boy toy here this week and now he won't leave me alone. 

Claire	Yeah?

Sarah	I'm only human, you know? It gets lonely. Even at home we haven't had sex since- 

Claire	Are you liking Kansas City? 

Sarah	Oh, yeah. Don't get me wrong, I love traveling, I love constantly meeting new people, it's so inspiring.

Claire	Yeah. That's why I do hair. 

Sarah	Really?

Claire	Yeah. You get to go in and out of other people's lives, hear stories, you give life advice, it's almost like having a family.

Sarah	Family ... You know something? I have a sister, I have two best friends at home, I even have a therapist, and the only two people who know I'm cheating on Greg are Boy Toy and you.

Claire	Why? You trust me?

Sarah	You're a total stranger. You're outside my actual real life. With you I trust that it doesn't matter. I trust I'll never see you again and my secret just vanishes with you. (silence) 

Claire	Hi Pepper! How's my girl? 

Claire	I guess we all want what we don't have. 

Speaker 	Are you ever going to use it? 

Olivia	No, and I told you that when you bought it for me. 

Speaker 	It's safer.

Olivia	Safer than what? Sunshine? 

Speaker 	Safer than going alone. 

Olivia	I wouldn't be alone if you would come with me. I'm going to take a shower. 

Speaker 	I might be gone by the time you get done. 

Olivia	Well be careful, I hear it's dangerous out there. 

Dawn	There you go. 

Speaker 	Thanks.

Speaker 	Hi.

Dawn	Hi, what can I get for you? 

Speaker 	Can I get a cappuccino please? 

Dawn	Yeah, for sure. What size? 

Speaker 	Small.

Dawn	Anything else for you? 

Speaker 	No.

Dawn	All right.

Dawn	I'll have that right out for you. 

Speaker 	Thank you.

Dawn	Medium almond milk chai latte? Claire? Want your usual? 

Claire	Chai latte with almond milk, please. 

Dawn	Okay, so your usual. Medium? 

Claire	Small is fine. 

Dawn	Okay. Thanks.

Dawn	Claire? I have that chai for you that you clearly need. 

Claire	Thanks.

Dawn	See you. (silence) 

Olivia	Hey, yeah, it's Olivia. What the fuck? I get that, but look in the lower left-hand corner. You see where it says cuticle management? Yeah, this is in fact an ad for cubicles, not cuticles. Yeah, it's a problem. Okay, great. Thank you.

Speaker 	Is it too soon to say I'm sorry? 

Olivia	Yeah.

Speaker 	I heard about Natalie bailing. She's always been really reliable, I swear. 

Olivia	It's okay, it's not your fault. Don't worry about it. 

Speaker 	What are you going to do? 

Olivia	I texted my regular stylist this morning. She doesn't normally do weddings but I begged and hopefully I'll hear back later today.

Speaker 	She any good? 

Olivia	She is amazing. She was my first choice. The stuff she does with hair, jaw dropping. 

Speaker 	Well, if she's so good why doesn't she do weddings? 

Olivia	That's a good question. I think they're a little high stress for her. 

Speaker 	Aren't you worried about fitting in your dress? 

Olivia	At this rate I'll be walking down the aisle in a baseball cap and overalls so I need this. 

Speaker 	Is everything else going okay? 

Olivia	As smoothly as possible. Charlie is a little tense but we haven't hired assassins yet. 

Speaker 	Well, if you ever need a recommendation I might know someone. 

Olivia	Oh really? Your hair lady just bailed on me so what do I do if your hit man bails on me? I'd be totally fucked.

Claire	Hi Dawn, the usual.

Dawn	Oh, there's the Claire I know. You doing better today? 

Claire	Great.

Dawn	Good.

Claire	Everything's great. 

Dawn	Thank you.

Speaker 	Hi.

Claire	Hi. Come on back.

Olivia	Claire, you are literally saving my life. 

Claire	I don't know about all that. Tell me everything. Oh, could you take this off? What are you hoping for? Do you have pictures of your dress?

Olivia	Do I have pictures of the dress? Okay. 

Claire	Oh my God, you look amazing.

Olivia	Yeah? It's the first one I tried on. 

Claire	Amazing. Perfect. All right, so hair, what are you hoping for? I mean, with that dress you could really wear any style.

Olivia	Yeah, so like down and a little curly. 

Claire	Do you have any photos of the styles you like so I can kind of have an idea? 

Olivia	Yeah, I took your advice, I did a lot of research. Like this. 

Claire	Okay. I love it. How is Charlie handling the wedding madness? Is he excited? 

Olivia	Yeah, I mean way more than me, he loves being the center of attention. We should all probably be worried that he's going to turn into a groom-zilla. Is it weird that I'm nervous right now?

Claire	A little. I'm kidding, it's totally normal. Hair is important, maybe the most important. It's going to be great though, I promise.

Olivia	Oh my God, Claire, this is amazing. I seriously don't know why you don't do weddings all of the time. This is amazing! So much better than the other girl.

Claire	Here. Check it out from behind. It's not that I don't like to do weddings, I just ... I don't know, I find them really ...	

Olivia	Intense?

Claire	Really...

Olivia	Intense?

Claire	Uh-huh (affirmative).

Olivia	Wow. I can't wait to see this with the dress. 

Claire	Neither can I. Can you send me a photo? 

Olivia	Oh, yeah.

Claire	Make sure you take it down before Charlie sees it. 

Olivia	How much do I owe you? 

Claire	?

Olivia	Oh, that's a steal.

Olivia	I wish I had someone to show it to tonight. Hey, what are you doing tonight? Do you want to come over and see the hair and the dress together?

Claire	I'd be happy to. 

Olivia	Yeah? Cool, I'll text you my address. 

Claire	Oh, I... I'd appreciate that. 

Olivia	Like, maybe eat dinner? 

Claire	Sure, but what about Charlie? 

Olivia	Oh, he'll probably be working late so girl's night. 

Claire	Okay.

Olivia	Yeah?

Claire	Yeah.

Olivia	Great. All right, see you tonight. 

Claire	Yeah.

Claire	(Silence)

Olivia	Hey, come on in.

Olivia	Sorry, it's a mess in here. I know. I told him I didn't want it, yet here it is. I already feel like I'm running in place all day at work, you know? When I run I actually want to get somewhere. You know what I'm saying?

Olivia	Oh, I was starving so I ordered pizza. I hope that's cool. 

Claire	Sounds great. 

Olivia	Oh, this is great. 

Claire	It's Merlot. I hope that's okay.

Olivia	Yes. Always yes. 

Olivia	(Silence)

Claire	Oh.

Olivia	To Claire, the savior of my wedding. 

Claire	Oh, I'm sorry. 

Olivia	No. No big deal. Do you want to see this dress? 

Claire	Of course.

Olivia	I'll be right back. 

Olivia	( Silence)

Olivia	Hey Claire. Could you come up here and help me with this? 

Claire	Yeah, coming.

Claire	(Silence)

Claire	Ready?

Olivia	Yeah, come on in. Apparently, I you can't put on a wedding dress by yourself. Fucking buttons, are you kidding me?

Olivia	k(Silence)

Claire	Perfect.

Olivia	No. The hair is perfect. Seriously Claire, it's amazing. I owe you so, so much. 

Claire	I'm just glad you like it. 

Olivia	Oh, can you take some photos for my mom and sister? 

Claire	Yeah, of course. 

Olivia	Here you go. 

Claire	Okay. Ready?

Olivia	Yeah.

Claire	Okay.

Olivia	And the back too?

Claire	Yeah. Okay, got it. 

Olivia	Thank you. Do you mind helping me get this off before I mess it up? 

Olivia	(Silence)

Claire	There you go. I'm going to wait downstairs. 

Olivia	Okay.

Olivia	(Silence)

Olivia	I never even thought I'd be a bride. I always thought if I got married it would be on a whim. 

Claire	Really?

Olivia	Yeah. I was super rebellious in high school. You know, "Fuck the patriarchy." I went to my prom in a tux.

Claire	I wouldn't have guessed that. 

Olivia	Yeah. Hopefully younger me doesn't hate current me. 

Claire	It looks like you have a huge family. 

Olivia	Yeah. They take up like half of the wedding invitations. Oh shit. See, the younger me does hate current me.

Claire	It's nice that you're close to your family. 

Olivia	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Claire	Is that your mom in that picture? 

Olivia	Yeah.

Claire	And your dad?

Olivia	No. That is my uncle. My mom's brother. My dad wasn't around. 

Claire	Really?

Olivia	Yeah. He was one of those classy gents who promised everything and then took off once the baby was born. I never knew him. Let's just say I'm walking myself down the isle. Oh God, listen to me. Getting married turns you into such a narcissist. It's like me, me, me. Stories about me. Tell me about you, Claire. What about you, are you close to your family?

Claire	Oh, um. I never knew my dad either. 

Olivia	Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, don't let it get to you. It's not you, it's him. I mean, look how amazing we turned out. Fuck him. What about your mom?

Claire	She died when I was . 

Olivia	Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. 

Claire	This is her. She was only . 

Olivia	She's really beautiful. 

Claire	She was drunk. I mean, that's how she died. She was a hair stylist also. She was always changing her hair color and her hair style. She never kept it the same way for more than a few months. I never knew who was going to come home.

Olivia	Well, I think it's cool that you're following in her footsteps. I'm sure she would be really proud. 

Claire	Really?

Olivia	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Oh. 

Olivia	Hey babe. This is Claire, my hair stylist. 

Charlie	Oh.

Olivia	The savior of the wedding. 

Charlie	Hi, Claire. It's nice to meet you. 

Claire	You too.

Olivia	Claire was just telling me that her mom was also a hair stylist- 

Charlie	It's been a really long day. I'm really hungry. 

Olivia	Oh. Yeah, okay. There are some slices left. 

Claire	I should probably call it a night. Thanks for having me. 

Olivia	Yeah, no thanks needed. See ya. 

Claire	I never knew my dad. I never knew my dad either. 

Claire	I should probably call it a night. I should probably... I should probably call it a night. I should probably call it a night! Fuck. Fuck.

Claire	(Silence)

Sarah	Shit, sorry. We close at :. 

Claire	Oh, sorry.

Sarah	Claire. It's kind of a late night for you isn't it? 

Claire	Yeah, emergency wedding hair. 

Sarah	Right. Come on in. 

Claire	Thanks.

Sarah	I'll just lock the door behind you if that doesn't make you too nervous. 

Sarah	The usual, right? 

Claire	Yeah.

Claire	(Silence)

Claire	It's a late night for you too, isn't it? 

Sarah	Yeah. Turns out I can only boss teenagers around if they actually show up. When they don't, I am the one who has to cover.

Sarah	(Silence)

Sarah	Oh, don't worry about it. I already counted the register. 

Claire	Thanks.

Sarah	Nothing like a late night caffeine fix and a double shift to make you rethink your life, right? 

Sarah	Oh well. I guess there's always grad school. 

Sarah	Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. And the next day, and the next day, and the next day. 

Sarah	(Silence)

Sarah	What? What the fuck, Claire? 

Sarah	(Silence)

Olivia	Don't let it get to you. 

Olivia	It's not you, it's him.

Olivia	I mean, look how amazing we turned out. Fuck him. 

Speaker 	Tobe to the front counter. Tobe to the front counter. Hardware store employee Keeping someone in or someone out? Sorry, bad joke. 

Claire	Keeping someone out. Definitely keeping someone out. 

Claire	(Silence) You need to go outside? 

Claire	(Silence)

Claire	Want to get breakfast Pep? Come on. 

Claire	(Silence)

Speaker 	Hi, how can I help you?

Speaker 	Hey. My wife's sister, Dawn, she's been missing for two days and we were wondering if we could put a flyer up in here.

Speaker 	My gosh, I'm so sorry to hear that. 

Speaker 	She worked just down the street, so we thought maybe her clients might be able to help. 

Speaker 	Absolutely. I'll hang this up for you. 

Speaker 	Thank you.

Speaker 	(Silence)

Claire	Don't wait up. I left out a little treat. 

Claire	(Silence)

Olivia	Claire! Hey, we're up here. Come on. 

Olivia	Oh my God. Oh, Claire. Claire, Claire, come on. Come in here. Here, make room. Okay, here you go. Sit right here. I have to warn you right now, I am very drunk.

Claire	That's fine. 

Olivia	This is my little sister, Rose. She got the looks in the family. This is Monique. We work together.

Monique	Hi.

Olivia	She's the one who screwed up my wedding hair. This is Chelsea, Elizabeth, and Christie. This is Claire, everybody. My hair stylist and the savior of my wedding.

Monique	Hey Claire.

Speaker 	Hi Claire.

Claire	Hi everyone.

Olivia	Okay, I did the introductions or whatever. Oh, you can have this drink. We just poured it. It can be for you.

Claire	Oh, thanks.

Olivia	We should drink. We should toast, right? Okay, a toast. To all the best bitches! 

Speaker 	Woo, yes!

Olivia	Oh my God. We should go dance. 

Speaker 	Yes.

Olivia	Right?

Speaker 	Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

Olivia	Right? Oh my God. Do you dance? You'll have so much fun. Okay. Oh, oh sorry. 

Claire	That's okay. 

Olivia	Oh my God.

Olivia	(Silence)

Claire	Will you watch my drink? I have to go to the bathroom. 

Olivia	Yeah. Wish someone would've watched mine. I lost count a long time ago. I'm never like this. I'm just... I am actually nervous. I meant it when I said that I thought I'd never get married. I don't really know what I'm doing.

Olivia	(Silence)

Claire	It's going to be great, Olivia. You're going to be beautiful.

Olivia	I do really love Charlie. I just feel like sometimes maybe he doesn't see me. He... 

Claire	He interrupted you.

Olivia	Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly how it feels. It feels like I've been interrupted. You get it. I'm glad you came.	

Claire	I'll be right back. 

Olivia	Hey, do you run?

Claire	Do I what?

Olivia	Run, like jog? I've never had a running buddy before. 

Claire	Yeah. Yeah. I love running. 

Olivia	Oh my God. Okay, when this wedding madness is over, you and I are going to run laps around this town, girl.

Claire	I'll be right back. 

Olivia	Okay.

Speaker 	I cannot pee in this dress. 

Speaker 	No.

Speaker 	Okay, who is that guy? 

Speaker 	No idea, but he keeps buying me drinks so I'm okay with him. 

Speaker 	Okay. So what's up with the hair stylist? Why is she here? 

Speaker 	I don't know. She's fucking creepy. I caught her staring at me. 

Speaker 	Does Liv know her? Actually know her? 

Speaker 	Just promise me when, if I get married, don't let me invite the cake lady or something. 

Speaker 	You are such a bitch. 

Speaker 	Well, who does that? 

Speaker 	I'll be your cake lady. 

Olivia	Oh my God. Thank you for coming. 

Speaker 	Love you.

Speaker 	Bye. Be safe. Have fun. 

Olivia	Thank you.

Speaker 	Check out the nails. I had to get them. My bestie is getting married this weekend. So a girl had to look good.

Olivia	Can I sit my aunt next her ex-husband's friend? It's not really that big of a deal. Help me with this!

Olivia	Oh, don't let it get to you. It's not you, it's him. I mean, look how amazing we turned out. 

Speaker 	Do you remember that thing I was telling you about last time? So it became this whole ordeal. And Mandy, you know her, right? Well, she just refuses to listen to Dominick. And it pisses him off. And then I have to hear from him how she doesn't listen. And from her how upset he is in his...

Olivia	Claire. What's up?

Claire	I know that you said you have everything under control, but I figured that there must be something I can do to help.

Olivia	How did you know where I worked? 

Claire	You've told me a million times. I remember when you first got hired here, you were so proud. 

Olivia	Oh yeah. Like I said, we're good. I'm going to head home. But I'll see you on Saturday. Okay? 

Claire	Maybe we could get together tonight with your bridesmaids, and we could talk about how you want their hair done. And then

Olivia	Claire, honey, this is a lot. I have a lot going on right now. My boss won't let me off on Friday for my own God damn rehearsal dinner.

Claire	That's why I want to help. 

Olivia	Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I don't want anyone else offering me help, or asking questions, or jumping in on things. I just need some space. Not just from you, from everyone. Okay?

Claire	Maybe you need space from Charlie. 

Olivia	What?

Claire	You said you weren't sure about him. About any of this. Maybe if you could just- 

Olivia	This is not something you say to people two days before their wedding. I'm telling you this, because I feel like you don't actually know that.

Claire	I'm sorry.

Olivia	I would not let my own mother say that shit to me or anyone who actually knows me. 

Claire	Strangers.

Olivia	What?

Claire	Sometimes people can talk to strangers in ways that they- 

Olivia	Don't be like this on Saturday. 

Claire	Bye.

Olivia	My house is a fucking disaster because tomorrow is the big day. It really crept up on us. I'm really excited. I guess we're ready.

Charlie	Hello. Claire.

Claire	Hi. Is this-

Charlie	Yeah. It's Charlie. What's up? 

Claire	Oh, sorry to bug you. I'm looking for Olivia. 

Charlie	She's pretty busy doing we just got to the rehearsal dinner with the family.

Claire	Do you need wine?

Charlie	What? Huh?

Claire	I might have an extra bottle lying around. 

Charlie	She wanted me to check that this wasn't an emergency. You're still good for tomorrow at 10:00 AM. Right?

Claire	Yes. Of course. I would never miss it. 

Charlie	Okay. Good. Yeah. Well cool. You can come early if you want to. We're just going to be running around and pretty busy.

Claire	Sure. Sorry. 

Charlie	No, you're good. We'll just see you tomorrow. Okay? 

Claire	You interrupted her, Charlie. 

Charlie	Yeah. All right. We'll see you tomorrow. All right. Bye. 

Olivia	I mean, look how amazing we turned out.

Claire	That glass ceiling is a real bitch. 

Claire	I guess we all want what we don't have. 

Woman in Apartment	Bye, guys. See you later. 

Claire	I need help. Could I use your phone? 

Woman in Apartment	Yeah. Wait right here, let me grab it. 

Man in Cafe	See you!

Claire	Funeral? Is she? 

Dawn	Don't you already know? Claire? 

Olivia's Fiance	Hey, look. I'm not nervous, you're nervous. There's nothing wrong with that. Hey, Claire. Hey. Thanks for being here.

Claire	Do you promise to make her happy? 

Olivia's Fiance	What, are we practicing my vows? Yeah, of course. 

Claire	Do you promise you really see her? 

Olivia's Fiance	I do. Let me get that. 

Frankie	Claire?

Claire	Yeah, hi.

Frankie	Great. Olivia's right this way, just follow me. 

Claire	Thanks. I wasn't sure where to go, I've never been here before. 

Frankie	Isn't it so beautiful?

Claire	How do you know Olivia? 

Frankie	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm her mother. I'm Frankie. 

Claire	Oh, it's nice to meet you. Olivia talks about you all the time. 

Frankie	Don't be silly. 

Olivia	Oh my God, Claire. Thank you so much for coming through. It means everything. 

Claire	Where should I set up?

Olivia	Is right here okay? 

Claire	Yeah. This is for you. 

Olivia	Thank you.

Claire	I'll just be a few minutes. 

Olivia	Okay. Okay, there it is. There it is. Chin down a little. 

Bridesmaid 	I hate it.

Olivia	I love it.

Bridesmaid 	Don't send that one to me. 

Olivia	I'll send you all  of them. I love that I had to actually stare at my hand. I can't not. 

Claire	I'm ready. Go take a look. 

Olivia	What do you think? How does it look? 

Bridesmaid 	You look so beautiful. 

Olivia	Thank you.

Bridesmaid 	It looks amazing. My gosh. [crosstalk ::] It's so beautiful. Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!

Claire	Do you want to get your hair done, too? 

Little Girl	Can you make it pretty like Olivia's? 

Claire	Of course, I can. You're very beautiful, so it's going to be easy. Come on. 

Frankie	There we go. 

Bridesmaid 	Oh, gosh. Gorgeous. Olivia, you look amazing. 

Bridesmaid 	Charlie is ready for the big reveal. You want to go see how he cleans up? 

Olivia	Got it?

Bridesmaid 	Mm-hmm (affirmative). You are so lucky. This is going to be fun. 

Claire	There you go, now you're ready to walk down the aisle. 

Little Girl	Thank you.

Claire	Oh, do you know where the bathroom is? 

Frankie	Oh, sure. It's right over there. 

Claire	Thanks.

Olivia's Fiance	Do you know how beautiful you are? And how lucky I am? Do you know how cold you are? I can't wait to marry you.

Bridesmaid 	Hey, they're looking with you. Need help with the veil, I think. 

Claire	On my way.

Bridesmaid 	Okay.

Olivia	Oh. Claire, you want to come over here and help with this so I don't mess up your beautiful work?	

Frankie	The usher's here. It's time for me to go, so I'll see you out there? 

Olivia	Yeah.

Frankie	I love you so much.

Olivia	I love you, too. 

Frankie	Okay, baby. 

Claire	There you go. 

Olivia	Thanks. Sorry that I barked at you the other day. Pressure's just been building for a while, you know?	

Claire	Yes. Yes.

Olivia	Claire, are you okay?

Claire	No. No, I'm sorry. I have to tell you something. 

Olivia	Okay. What is it? 

Claire	I don't run.

Olivia	What?

Claire	I don't run, Olivia.

Speaker 	Please be seated.

Olivia's Fiance	What the fuck? 

Bridesmaid	Where's Olivia? Hurry! Go look for her! 

Olivia's Fiance	What did you do? What did you do? 

Bridesmaid 	What's going on?

Olivia's Fiance	Where is she? Where is she?
