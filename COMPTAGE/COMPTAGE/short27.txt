THOMAS	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS 	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER	Ashima and Rajiv had a long way to go to get home. And on their way back to India they had to go through Austria.

STORYTELLER	As Ashima and Rajiv puffed into the Austrian mountains, the tracks got very steep.

STORYTELLER	Rajiv didn't like going through the mountain railways. He had never been so high up before.

STORYTELLER	But Ashima liked the mountains. They reminded her of home.

STORYTELLER	Ashima and Rajiv soon came to a bridge. 'Whoah! I don't like the look of that!' said Rajiv. 'What's the matter with it?' Asked Ashima. 'It's very high up and I don't like being high up!' 'But we have to cross it,' said Ashima. 'It's the way home! Come on!' 

STORYTELLER	'I can't look!' So Ashima came back again.

STORYTELLER	'Don't worry, Rajiv, The Nil Giri railway where I work has the steepest hills and the highest bridges you can imagine.' 

STORYTELLER	'I'm not sure how that helps me!' 

STORYTELLER	'I tell you what, you close your eyes and I'll make sure you get safely through the mountains.' 

STORYTELLER	So, Ashima coupled up to Rajiv. 'Now keep your eyes closed!' 'Don't worry about that! I will!'

STORYTELLER	So Ashima pulled Rajiv slowly and carefully across the bridge...

STORYTELLER	And further into the mountains. 

STORYTELLER	Ashima loved puffing along the winding tracks. It was colder than her railway in India...but the tunnels, trees and high bridges were just like the Nil Giri railway.

STORYTELLER	'We're at the top now Rajiv! Don't you want to see?' 

STORYTELLER	Being this high up made Rajiv a little scared. But he did want to see what it looked like being so high up in the mountains... 

STORYTELLER	Rajiv thought it was the most magnificent sight he had ever seen.He could see the trees and the mountains. And the houses were so far away, they looked like tiny little boxes.

STORYTELLER	'Maybe heights aren't so scary after all...' 'As long as you have a friend to look after  you!'

THOMAS	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
