(HELPING HIRO)


THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	Making sure you tell someone when you're going somewhere!

THOMAS	When Hiro had an accident and needed new parts. I decided to help find him some. 

THOMAS	I thought if I went back to the woods where I first met Hiro, I may find some of his old parts, But I didn't tell anyone where I was going.

THOMAS	Then there was trouble. The old rails had given way and I got stuck in the mud. And no-one knew where I was to come and help me. 

THOMAS	I tried to call for help, but no-one could hear me! 

THOMAS	Luckily, Harold saw my steam. And soon my friends came to rescue me!

THOMAS	I realised that because I hadn't told anyone where I was going no-one knew where I was. I was very lucky that Harold saw me!

THOMAS	That's why it's always important to tell someone where you are going.
