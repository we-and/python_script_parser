(Glammys School Of Fashion vlog EPS 04)

     
KEI	When I have a plan in my head I don’t want there to be spies around... then, though, I always forget the glass door! 

KEI	So: microchips, circuits, photos of disgusting dresses...  
 
CRYSTAL	Have you by any chance seen my photos of beautiful dresses? 

ELECTRA	Shush and come and see, Kei is in the laboratory.

KEI	Be careful though not to have your ideas stolen... Especially from those really nice ones...

BOTH	No, no, no, don’t do it, noooo!!!

KEI	Chewing gum.. the perfect weapon... Now I am ready to get to work... I have a personal approach to fashion… totally technological

BOHEME	...now: each of you has developed something, in your own way and with your own style, but, they must be of good taste...Kei, your assignment is missing...

KEI	Ehh?!... It’s right there next to you, teacher.

BOHEME	Uhm, but these are glasses...and what do they represent?

KEI	Look at the class early in the morning... Now wear the glasses and look again!

BOTH	(Growl) Oh god, you are difficult

BOHEME	Incredible... 

KEI	You see?

BOHEME	...and what happens when you look at other things?

KEI	...these glasses, thanks to a special microchip that I invented, swap bad taste and neglect for images of things that are always in fashion. 

BOHEME	Kei, you really are a technological genius ! 

VAN LINDEN	(Clears throat)

BOHEME	Wowww, uh, hi...are you the new teacher?

VAN LINDEN	Your time was up 15 minutes ago!

KEI	And with that I took back my glasses. And I am perfecting you: wow you’re all so fashionable!
