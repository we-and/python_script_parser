SINGER	I'm taking my freedom, pulling it off the shelf, putting it on my chain, wear it around my neck.  I'm taking my freedom, putting it in my car, wherever I choose to go, it will take me far.  I'm living my life like it's golden, living my life like it's golden, living my life like it's golden, living my life like it's golden, living my life like it's golden, golden.  Living my life like it's golden, living my life like it's golden, living my life like it's golden, living my life like it's golden, living my life like it's golden.

EVA	(sighs)

EVA	"Dear Ms. Fletcher, thank you for the trust (indistinct) each and every one of you can go straight to hell.

DEREK	Eva?  What's going on?

EVA	I hired the best headhunter, I had two dozen interviews, and I killed every single one of them.  I know you want me out, but I'm gonna need some more time.

DEREK	You're being blackballed, I'm sorry.

EVA	(sighs)

DEREK	But I'm still gonna need you to move out by the end of the month.

EVA	(sighs) Eva Fletcher.

ELMER	I am thrilled to be sitting across from a candidate from the Big Green.

EVA	(chuckles) A pleasure to represent.

ELLA	Old Elmer was at your alma mater before they even admitted women.

CARLTON	I have one more question for you, Ms. Fletcher.

ELLA	Dr. Fletcher, I think it says here on her CV.

CARLTON	Have you, uh, you attended Ivies, and you were the president of one of those fancy liberal arts colleges, said yourself you grew up the indulged Army brat of a Brigadier General.  Share with me what you know about life at a historically black college.

EVA	Pride, tradition, excellence, those are your expectations.  And yet the university has gone from a top five HBCU to falling out of the top 25.  Now, I took Laura Farnsworth College from being simply admired to one that is competitive.  HBCU or Ivy, excellence is excellence.

CARLTON	Excellence is excellence but our budget is our budget.

EVA	I bet I can find 10% pure fat in my first year.

CEDRIC	Let's go.

CHANTEL	I saw them when they did it.

CEDRIC	You ain't seen nothing.

CEDRIC	Come on, hurry up.

BONES	Find that ho.  The one that saw.

DREDS	All right.

CEDRIC	(panting)

BERETTA	Cedric, what's going on?

CEDRIC	Uh, nothing.  Yo, ma, what are you doing?

BERETTA	Ask me that again (indistinct) I smash you upside your head.

CEDRIC	You don't even know what happened.

BERETTA	Okay.  Okay, Cedric, what happened?  Exactly, I'm tired of jumping every time my phone rings, I'm scared, the police are gonna come knocking on my door in the middle of the night, I promised your father I would not let these streets have you.

CEDRIC	Ain't nobody got me.  Ain't I supposed to go to Chicago State in the fall?

BERETTA	No, Cedric, you're not.

CEDRIC	What?

BERETTA	That's not the only school you got into.

CEDRIC	Hey, I can't go to Georgia.  You know I can't.  Ma, what about my music?

BERETTA	They got music in Atlanta.  Grab them.

SINGER	Yeah.  Load them up.  Yeah.  I'm on a new level.

BACKUP SINGER	Yeah.

SINGER	I'm on a new level.  I'm on a new level.  I'm on a new level.  I'm on a new level.  I'm on a new level.  Brought me a new shovel.

CHARLES	Hey, how you doing, young man?

CEDRIC	What's up?

BERETTA	Uh, hi, I'm Beretta, Cedric's mother.

CHARLES	Hi.

BERETTA	This is my aunt Vida.

VIDA	Hi.  How are you doing?

CHARLES	Hi, uh, I'm Charles Richardson.  These are my sons Duncan and your new roommate, Bryce.

BRYCE	How you doing?

CEDRIC	What's up, fam?  It's nice to meet you.

BRYCE	Yeah.

CEDRIC	Oh, dope, we've got a TV?

BRYCE	No, I got a TV.

CEDRIC	Whatever, blueblood.

CHARLES	Let's get the rest of your stuff, son.

CEDRIC	All right.

CHARLES	Nice meeting you.

BERETTA	Likewise.

MELISSA	And today, I continue my four-part series on crime in urban America.  In Chicago, three men were killed in a night club shooting.  The victims included an off-duty police officer working security and a University of Illinois Engineering student.

BERETTA	Cedric, I am putting your undershirts in here with your belts in the second drawer, okay?

MELISSA	We don't tell because we're smart enough to be afraid of the people we should be afraid of.

BERETTA	Cedric?  Help us put your stuff up.

MELISSA	Justice from a system that is demonstrated, black lives don't matter.

CARLTON	Ladies and gentlemen, our new Georgia A&M President, Dr. Eva Fletcher.

EVA	Thank you.  Thank you.  Pride, tradition, excellence.  Those are the words engraved on our gates.  They are also the principles my husband and I have instilled in our daughter, Sydney.  She's a freshman here and we couldn't be more excited.

SYDNEY	Why do I have to move?  She's the one who got fired.

EVA	I wasn't fired, I resigned.

SYDNEY	Well, I didn't "resign," so I shouldn't have to go with you.

DEREK	You barely graduated, Syd.  We were lucky that your mother's new position includes your free education.

SYDNEY	But dad, I can go to junior college here.  My life is here, the father that I'd much rather live with is here.

EVA	This isn't a negotiation.

SYDNEY	What's wrong?  Afraid you'll be lonely?  Afraid you won't make any friends?

EVA	Sydney.

DEREK	That's enough, Sid.

EVA	There are those who say the historically black college is no longer necessary, that our support has dried up.

EBONIE	Why does it take bougie people forever to make a damn point?

NONI	Shh.

EVA	To that, I say…

EBONIE	Shh.

EVA	…excellence has no expiration date.

EBONIE	You don't know me like that.

CEDRIC	No, I could've said all that by names I could beat on, you know what I'm saying?

NONI	Grow up.

EVA	We begin…

NONI	Both of you.

EVA	…our trek back to the top…

EBONIE	You know, you're starting to sound less like my roommate and too much like my mama.  Hey, you know that Boy Rav coming through here next week, right?

CEDRIC	Come on, you already know I got front row tickets to that shit.

EBONIE	(chuckles)

EVA	We begin our future by honoring our past.  This year, we begin our climb back to the top and we will do it together.

CECIL	Welcome to the walk-on tryouts.

NONI	Thank you, Director Diamond, sir.

CECIL	What do you know about this band?

NONI	The Georgia Agricultural and Mechanical University Marching Mountain Cats was established in 1918, with 17 all male members.  Women weren't allowed in until 1942.  When Lula Mae Young's so impressed with her trumpet, she couldn't be denied.  The Marching Mountain Cats became your Marching Mountain Cats in 1996.  You play seven instruments, sir.  But your first, the alto sax, is still your favorite.  That's why I play it since I was six.  You're my idol, sir.

CECIL	You've got good taste.

NONI	And I faithfully pledge to uphold the standards…

DANNY	What in the hell gives you right to recite my creed?  Have you lost your damn mind, freshman?  Are you a Mountain Cat?

NONI	No.

DANNY	Exactly.  With your cocky ass, running my history.  Check up.

CECIL	Proceed.

CHRYSTAL	All right, well, I just needed your signature on this.

EVA	Okay.  What is it?

CHRYSTAL	It is the Fall Semester Bonfire of Freedom, ma'am.  Fire and police department have to be here, state law, and, um, the--all the entertainment, probably a rapper.

EVA	$50,000?  You do realize the school was broke, right?

CHRYSTAL	Yeah, it, it's a big fire, it's…

EVA	We can't afford that.

CHRYSTAL	Well, we've been doing that since 19…

CECIL	(playing piano)

CECIL'S ASSISTANT	Mr. Diamond, your 10:30 is here.

EVA	Thank you.

CECIL	Oh, almost gave up on you.

EVA	After 10 minutes?

CECIL	After five minutes.  So, what can I do for you?

EVA	What you can do for our university.  That's what I came to discuss.

CECIL	Being a nationality celebrated cash cow is a no?

EVA	The band has no bigger fan than its new president.  Makes me wish I didn't put down my flute.

CECIL	I'm sure you had good reason.

EVA	Cecil, it is no secret that the school's in financial straits and most departments are in the red.

CECIL	Not mine.

EVA	Maybe you could stay in standard hotel rooms, fly business class.

CECIL	I bring in more money to this university than any other program but you want me to tighten my belt?

EVA	We'd save a lot of money.

CECIL	You know, it took me 20 years to get the band to this level of undeniability.  When I'm in the barber's chair, I'm creating new formations, when I'm getting my prostate checked, I'm writing new arrangements, live, sleep.

EVA	I get it.  The band is that good because you are that good but we both have jobs to do.

CECIL	We do, and perks to consider, like living in a 10,000 square foot president's mansion alone.

EVA	I'd--uh, I'd like us to work as a team.  And if you aren't interested in that, then it turns into a pissing contest and that would put you in a distinct disadvantage.  Have a productive day, Mr. Diamond.

COACH HARDWICK	How badly do you want to break the hole, baby?  Let's do it.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.

EVA	I assume this is about money, so I'll just cut right to it.  Your team's record is abysmal.  And I can't get you funding the university doesn't have for a team that bad.

COACH HARDWICK	Wow.  Been a long day, huh?

EVA	(chuckles) Yes, it has.  I'm sorry.

COACH HARDWICK	Then you're right.  We do suck.  Hard to win games without stars who do what we need.  If they can do what we need, they have options.  So, it makes me wonder why you're here.  I mean, obviously, you have options.

EVA	Each and every one of you can go straight to hell.  Is there anything else?

COACH HARDWICK	Nope.

EVA	Okay.  Look, I have a meeting.  So, have a productive day, coach.

EBONIE	Your lips were so attached to Diamond's butt.  I was about to pronounce y'all ass and wife.

NONI	You're stupid.

EBONIE	But I ain't mad.  I mean, ever since I've seen the Mountain Cats perform at Alcorn State, it's just been like, (rapping) "Nothing can save ya, 'cause this is the season of catching the vapors."

NONI	Biz Markie, 1988.

EBONIE	What you know about Biz?

NONI	(chuckles) My father, the conservative MD, talked my ear off about the history of hip hop.  He listens to it, like, every day.

EBONIE	Really?  So does my uncle.  He's like a 45-year-old rapper, still trying to get a record deal.

NONI	Oh, and I saw that performance at Alcorn State.  I still watch it all the time.  Mr. Diamond is the truth.

EBONIE	Which what explains why your lips was all on his old ass.

NONI	Okay, woman, I'm the only freshman walk-on he chooses, you'll wish you would've puckered up, too.

NONI	Oh, my God.  They posted the band list.

EBONIE	Go to the website.

CARLTON	Oh, here's something (indistinct)

CECIL	Uh-uh, no, no.  You know I'm allergic to smoke.  I just like the ambiance.

CARLTON	Her black skin don't make her black.  Not black-black.  Not, not running-a-black-university black.

CECIL	Frat, I've been listening to you bitch and moan for two hours.  What's your plan?

CARLTON	Oh, oh, I got a goddamn plan.  I'm resigning.  Already wrote the letter.  And you know the worse part.

CECIL	Hmm?

CARLTON	They'll call me to clean up Black Ivy's mess when she fails.  So I have to make sure she fails quickly.

CECIL	Kings and queens, presidents and prime ministers request command performances from one marching band.

WOMAN	Whoa, yeah.

CECIL	And that band is Your Georgia A&M Mighty Marching Mountain Cats.

GEORGIA A&M MIGHTY	MARCHING MOUNTAIN 

CATS.	(chanting) G, G-G-G, A, A-A-A, M, M-M-M, G-A-M-U.  G, G-G-G, A, A-A-A, M, M-M-M, G-A-M-U.  G, G-G-G, A, A-A-A, M, M-M-M, G-A-M-U.	

CECIL	Yeah.  Pick it up.

CECIL	Come on out now, freshmen, show 'em why you're here.

COACH HARDWICK	You see?  You see that?  He keeps planting his pivot foot like that, a matter of time before he takes a bad hit and lose that 
knee.

EVA	Good afternoon, gentlemen.  I need to speak with you.

COACH HARDWICK	(clears throat) Uh, gentlemen, will you excuse us?  I'd like to be fired in private.

COACHES	(chuckle)

EVA	Appreciate it, gentlemen.

COACH	Good day, ma'am.

EVA	This is BoJohn Folsom from Carlito, Texas.  Played varsity as a freshman…

COACH HARDWICK	Freshman.  First team All-American in sophomore and junior year.  Best quarterback to come out of the Southwest in ten years.

EVA	You know him?

COACH HARDWICK	Couldn't call myself a coach if I didn't.  And he could've gone onto any division one school, but then he choked his coach.  He's on the untouchable list, Eva.

EVA	So was Randy Moss.  Stars lead to wins and wins lead to funding.

COACH HARDWICK	Why can't you take my word on this?

EVA	Because if you don't tell me what I want to hear, I don't believe you.

COACH HARDWICK	What the hell is that supposed to mean?

EVA	It means we're going on a recruiting trip.

COACH HARDWICK	Look, I already got a team, Eva, been set since spring.

EVA	Then reset it.  I've got to get this school out of debt and I think I might be able to do that with big bad Bo.  Let's go, Coach.

BEN	Y'all seemed like nice folks, so I'm gonna be honest with you, this is a waste of your time.

EVA	Not so, Mr. Folsom.  For us, no matter how this meeting goes, we met a really nice family.

COACH HARDWICK	But I can't tell you how much we're hoping to walk out that door with a commitment from your talented son, there.  BoJohn, are you ready to wear the Burgundy & Black?

BOJOHN	I guess so.

BEN	I'm handling my son's recruitment.

EVA	Mr. Folsom, "recruitment" suggests that there are colleges, plural, knocking on your son's door.

COACH HARDWICK	What Dr. Fletcher is saying is BoJohn has already sat out two years.  Now, if he makes the team, I'll make room for him on my roster, give him a free ride.

BEN	I want what's best for my boy, so let me be blunt, how much salt do you got in that pepper of yours?

COACH HARDWICK	We've got two white players.  But, Mr. Folsom, football is about what's under the skin.  And I promise you…

EVA	I apologize for, uh, cutting you off, Coach Hardwick, but begging is for dogs.  Georgia A&M graduates eighty percent of its players and boasts the most celebrated marching band in college sports.

COACH HARDWICK	Sixteen years and counting.

EVA	Drop your business card on the table and let's go, Coach.

CEDRIC	Oh, great, but that's not it.

LORENZO	Man, then we didn't lay it down there, man.  You just got take your stank ass back in the booth like I told you two hours ago.

CEDRIC	Man, who is you calling stank ass?

LORENZO	Well, just respect my environment, boss.

CEDRIC	Auntie, what're you doing here?  Is mama alright?

AUNTIE VIDA	Who do you think sent me?  She's fine.  Everyone is fine.

CEDRIC	All right.  Can I holler at you later?  I'm on the clock right now.

AUNTIE VIDA	No, you're on your mama's credit card, that's what you're on.

CEDRIC	(whispers) Mama just gave me that credit card.

AUNTIE VIDA	For emergencies.


CEDRIC	And what, what do I got to do, huh?  But I stay out of trouble.  My grades are right.  I ain't nobody's daddy, am I?  What do I got to do just to get a little support for my dream?

AUNTIE VIDA	Here.  Now, ain't no more where this came from, 'cause I don't like this hippity-hoppity rap mess.

LORENZO	Fifteen minutes.

CEDRIC	Look, can you shut the hell up, bruh?  I love you, auntie.

AUNTIE VIDA	Oh.  (chuckles) I love you, too.

CEDRIC	Now play that back, bruh.

NONI	Hey.

EBONIE	Hey, where you been, roomie?

NONI	I'm a Google scholar, remember?  Had a coding meeting.

EBONIE	Okay, I was just asking.  Damn.

NONI	Knock it out the box, Rick.

EBONIE	Children's Story, 1989, I wish it was both of us.

NONI	But it's not.  So go.  Work as hard as I would've.

EBONIE	I will.

WOMAN	You (indistinct) step.

MAN	(indistinct) Uh-huh.

WOMEN	(singing) And you, baby, you want this?

MAN	You better work.

MAN	Okay.

WOMEN	(singing) And you, baby, you want this?

MAN	That's right.

MAN	Hey, whoa.

COACH HARDWICK	Everybody take a knee.  New guy, hand in the air.  This is BoJohn Folsom.  He's a late walk-on, QB3.

MAN	He coming for you, QB1.

TERRENCE	I ain't scared.

MAN	Yeah, what's up with that?

VERNON	He better be.

COACH HARDWICK	Now, we got one week 'til full scrimmage, two 'til opening game.  We practice like we have since spring, like you're still trying to earn a spot.

MAN	Yes, sir.

COACH HARDWICK	BoJohn Folsom, follow me.  Rest of you, hit the field.

BOJOHN	What's up, coach?

COACH HARDWICK	Listen up, BoJohn Folsom.  Kids play, I don't.  You ever raise a hand to me, you'll never raise it to anybody else.

BOJOHN	Yes, sir.  One favor though, you mind calling me Bo?

COACH HARDWICK	Hit the field, BoJohn.

REFEREE	(whistles)

VERNON	(grunts)

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Hey.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Oh.

SYDNEY	(laughs) Not what I lead with, but, yeah.

BRYCE	Bryce.

SYDNEY	Sydney.

BRYCE	I read that your father's a judge.  Mine, too.

SYDNEY	Then, you're probably as unhappy about being here as I am.

BRYCE	No.  I'm third generation A&M, and proud of it.

SYDNEY	Okay.  You know, I don't wanna make up a fake boo or lie about what I'm doing tonight.  So, while I'm flattered…

BRYCE	Don't be.  Surprise.  I'm not hitting on you.  I was just wondering why your mother cut the bonfire, one of our oldest traditions.

SYDNEY	Yeah.  Well, she has some traditions too, like not giving a damn about what you think is important.

EBONIE	This party is off the chain.  Oh, look at that cutie over there.  Uh-hmm.  Oh.

MAN	Oh.

EBONIE	Look at this table.  I'm glad I brought my big purse.

CEDRIC	Yeah, my mom does the same thing at the all-you-can-eat buffet.

EBONIE	(laughs) Who you trying to clown on, "Flow Genius?"

CEDRIC	So, I see you found y'boy on Twitter, huh?

SYDNEY	Not possible.  My mother in fact does know everything.

MADISON	(laughs)

SYDNEY	Man, I wish I could live in the dorms.

MADISON	Wait, you can with me, my roommate just bailed.

SYDNEY	Serious?

MADISON	Yeah.  Said I was plain nastiness when my hair was always everywhere.

DANNY	Sound like some pussies think they ready to be big cats ready to be initiated into my den.

DANNY	Step into my office, scrubs.  No, leave the instruments.  You don't need them.  Let's go, I ain't got all day.

MAN	What happen to all that chanting?

DANNY	(indistinct) Check them.

CHRYSTAL	(knocks on door)

EVA	Uh-huh?

CHRYSTAL	Sorry to bother you, ma'am.  One of the band members was just rushed to the hospital.

EVA	What?

CHRYSTAL	Some sort of head injury.

EVA	Bring me more details.  Oh, God.

SYDNEY	You know, staring at your phone won't actually make it ring.

MADISON	(sighs) Look, I don't know what I'm doing.  I was never like this before.  But I just know that he's at UGA having way more fun 
than I am here.

SYDNEY	Well, there are ways to keep yourself busy.

MADISON	No, I am not like that.

SYDNEY	Hmm.

MADISON	But if I were, I definitely like that.

SYDNEY	Well, look at you, suddenly so thirsty.

MADISON	(laughs)

SYDNEY	I'll go find out more for you.

MADISON	Hmm.  For me.  (laughs)

BOJOHN	Hi.

SYDNEY	I bet we're thinking the exact same thing.

BOJOHN	What's that?

SYDNEY	I've never been around this many black people.

BOJOHN	Even if I was thinking that, I'm not stupid enough to say it.  I know I'm not calling you stupid.

SYDNEY	Better be careful what you eat if you wanna keep that body.  They fry water down here.

BOJOHN	Well, they fry it, flip it and fry it again where I'm from.

SYDNEY	(laughs) Seriously, you're out?

BOJOHN	Got to stay out of trouble.

SYDNEY	I don't see that happening.

EVA	Hi.

NONI	Hi.

EVA	I'm Dr. Fletcher.

NONI	Dr. Fletcher.  I'm Noni, Ebonie's roommate.  This is drum major, Danny.

DANNY	Hello.

EVA	What happened to her, Danny?

DANNY	Complicated choreography, ma'am.  It's hard to learn.  She collided with an instrument.

NONI	I've got to go.  I'll see you later, Eb, okay?

CECIL	Good afternoon.

EVA	I wish it was, but since one of our students is lying in the hospital…

CECIL	My band, my business.

EVA	…which is why I'm surprised you aren't there.

CECIL	I take responsibility for choosing her.  She wasn't in step, that's why she got hurt.

EVA	She isn't hurt.  She's in critical condition.

CECIL	And getting the best medical care money can buy.

EVA	I looked into some of your mishaps over the past five years.

CECIL	And what you find, that four mil a year I bring in?

EVA	File an incident report by the end of the day.

CECIL	Don't you hold your breath, Black Ivy.

EVA	I'm sorry?  Oh, right, I get it.  So you think because I grew up in a wealthy family, attended Ivy League schools and married well, then I'm not down, not black?  My ability to survive and my intellect and both very black, Mr. Diamond.

CECIL	My point is simple.  I don't answer to you and I never will.

EVA	My point is simple as well.  You do as I asked you or I will not hesitate to put my foot directly in your ass.  That black enough for you?

CARLTON	The way she wears her ignorance on her sleeve, that's what gets me.

MAN	(indistinct) can't let this woman destroy GAM U.

CARLTON	Yes.  Told Cecil Diamond, he need to start flying coach.

MAN	(on phone) (indistinct)

CARLTON	(chuckles) I couldn't agree more.

MAN	(on phone) How about some drinks?

CARLTON	Yeah, yeah.  Drinks next week.

MAN	(on phone) Yeah, next week.

CARLTON	Drinks, yeah.

MAN	(on phone) Hello?

CARLTON	D?  (laughs) How you doing?

MAN	(on phone) I'm good.  You?

CARLTON	Oh, I'm fair to middling.  (laughs) You got a minute?

CECIL	I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like this.  The melody is way off.  Come on, now.  Drum section, set it off.

CECIL	Hey.

BRUCE	Good morning, Mr. Director.

CECIL	Good morning, Bruce.

BRUCE	Looking good.  You going to the White House?

CECIL	Well, you'll always be the first to know.

BRUCE	(chuckles) And, uh, yeah, thank you.  But, uh, you called me.

CECIL	I got something for you.

ELLA	Anyone notice a common thread in the reading?  Sydney?

SYDNEY	No idea.

ELLA	How about something obvious?  What moved them?  What united them most?  With these things I could not see.  Are we motivated by things we cannot see?

MADISON	Race, in a way.  I mean, we can see it but it's not really there, scientifically speaking.

DESHAWN	Skin color was real enough for the white man to make us slaves.  Right, white people?

ELLA	Deshawn, respect and decorum.

SYDNEY	Some Africans were slaves to other Africans and Madison's right.  The genetic variation in skin color is microscopic.  Skin color, race, it's only a divider because this society needs it to be.

DESHAWN	The black white girl is deep.

ELLA	Deshawn.

CEDRIC	(knocks on door) Sup, Eb?  Last time I was in a hospital was when my cousin got shot.  It's all the same, though.  You know, I got like 20 of these made.  You already know I got to give one to your boy (indistinct)

CEDRIC	You know, it'll make it easy for you to check your boy out.  Thought you might like this.  Yeah, you like that, huh?  All right, I'm out.

DEREK	Hey.

EVA	Did I wake you?

DEREK	Sydney okay?

EVA	Sydney's fine.  I'm not.

DEREK	(on phone) What is it?

EVA	I miss that.  The way concern sounds in your voice.

DEREK	Tell me what's going on, Eva.

EVA	I thought I'd just jump in and crush it and be back to my real life in a year or two.

DEREK	(on phone) It's been tougher than you thought, huh?

EVA	This place is--it's hard, Derek.  It's a lot harder than it should be.

DEREK	Do you need to get that?

EVA	It's probably Sydney coming to wash her clothes.  Hold on.

JASON	You are a one hard woman to get ahold of.

EVA	How did you get in?  What are you doing here?

JASON	I got my ways and I wanted to see you.

EVA	Well, you've seen me.  Now go.

EVA	It's my husband.

JASON	Perfect.  That means he's not here then, right?

EVA	Goodbye, Jason.

JASON	Oh, I'm Jason now?  Hmm?  What happened to Six Pack?

EVA & JASON	(moan)

JASON	Good morning, gorgeous.

EVA	You don't have to do all that.

JASON	Yes, I did.  Only the best for my woman.

EVA	Jason.

JASON	Oh, is that the time?  Damn, I got to go.  I can't be late for class.

EVA	You have class today?  You're never gonna get back to Connecticut in time.

JASON	It's all good.  I'm just going across campus.  I'm a Mountain Cat now.  I'ma call you later.  Bye.

EVA	No.

ELMER	Dr. Fletcher.

EVA	Good morning, Dr. Randolph.

ELMER	Not according to our boosters.  The Mountain Cat marching band is the crown jewel of this institution.  It would not be without Cecil Diamond.  What do you hope to accomplish by antagonizing him?

EVA	Is that what we're calling my concern for a hospitalized student?

ELMER	He can clean his own house.

EVA	She could've died.

ELMER	Eva, do not interfere with that band any way, shape or from.

NONI	You won't believe what happened in World History yesterday.  Deshawn got scolded.  Ebonie?  Ebonie?  Help.  Nurse, somebody help.  Please help.  Ebonie.

HEAD NURSE	She's seizing.

NURSE	Miss, we need you to leave.

NONI	Ebonie.

NURSE	Now, miss, please.

HEAD NURSE	Call Dr. Millar.

DR. MILLAR	Excuse me.

HEAD NURSE	She's seizing, Dr. Millar.

CHRYSTAL	I'm sorry to bother you, Dr. Fletcher, but can I get you some lunch, please?

EVA	Uh-huh?

CHRYSTAL	May I help you?

EVA	Hi, Noni.  What can I do for you?

NONI	I need to tell you something.  (sobs)

EVA	Okay.

NONI	(cries)

EVA	Oh, no.  It's gonna be okay.  Seniors in the band attacked Ebonie Weaver and Diamond knew it was going to happen.

ELLA	May I suggest a decaf?

EVA	Oh, it gets better.  I got a visit from Randolph and he told me to leave it alone, talked to me like I was a child.

ELLA	Well, I know you didn't think they were just gonna let you come in and take over the university.

EVA	What are we even talking about?  Who?

ELLA	The men that have been running it since 1852.

EVA	I'm here, aren't I?  They hired their first woman president.  It must mean they were ready for some kind of change.

ELLA	Okay, let's say that the trustees allow you to fire the man that heads their biggest moneymaker.  Is that really a win?  With the anti-hazing laws, legal fees alone will bankrupt this school.  So you get justice for one student and three thousand, two hundred others get screwed.  And you too, by the way, replaced by Carlton Pettiway who wanted the job in the first place.

EVA	I didn't sign up for this.  If I had anywhere, anywhere else to go.

ELLA	But you don't.

WOMAN	Here you go.

SYDNEY	I have to be.

MADISON	I mean, one of us (indistinct)

JALEN	Yo, yo, yo, what's going on?  How y'all doing?

SYDNEY	Hello.

JALEN	Y'all registered to vote?

SYDNEY	Of course.

JALEN	Cool.  Well, check this out.  Sigma Mu Kappa's throwing a little mixer before the Rav concert.  Don't you wanna come through?

SYDNEY	Maybe.

JALEN	Maybe?  Okay.  I wanna see you there.

MADISON	I've heard stuff about those guys.

MADISON	OMG.

WOMAN	Is that her?

MADISON	I'm sorry.

SYDNEY	Whatever.

EVA	Hello.  I'm Eva Fletcher, President of Georgia A&M.  Hi, Ebonie, it's Dr. Fletcher.  You're looking good.

JUNE	June Weaver, Ebonie's father.  This is DeLois, her mother.

DELOIS	She got through surgery, praise God.  Can't wait to get her back to Miami, put all of this behind us.

EVA	You're taking her out of school?

JUNE	Don't worry, we're not suing.  I'm not having my daughter's name attached to that monster for the rest of her life.

EVA	When monsters are allowed to prey on whomever they will…

JUNE	It's not our fight, Dr. Fletcher.

EVA	With all due respect, I don't think that's true.

JUNE	You know, with all due respect, our daughter is no longer your business.

EVA	Please hear me out.  Ebonie is vivacious.  She is smart, she's a worker, exactly the kind of student we want here.

DELOIS	And we can't get her far enough away.

JUNE	(sighs)

BOJOHN	Watch 64, 64, Mike, 64, Mike.  Hey, beta three, beta three.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	I'ma get your ass back to jail.

BOJOHN	Wide, ready, hut.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	That's what we call (indistinct)

REFEREE	(whistle blowing)

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Hey, man, you need to get up out of here.

MITCHELL	Damn, attempted murder.  Ain't you supposed to be the great white hope?  I was wide open.

BOJOHN	What the hell am I doing?

COACH HARDWICK	All right, bring it in.  Take a knee.  All right, listen up.  We got our first scrimmage tomorrow, people are talking about us.  But usually, they're just going on and on about how much I suck.

COACH HARDWICK	But now, they're trashing the team.  You know, I learned a long time not to worry about what people say.  Worry about what we do and what do we do, gentlemen?

FOOTBALL PLAYERS	Make plays.

COACH HARDWICK	What?

FOOTBALL PLAYERS	Make plays.

COACH HARDWICK	What?

FOOTBALL PLAYERS	Make plays.

COACH HARDWICK	You're damn right.  Break.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Let's go break down, fellas, break down.

TAVARUS	Hey, QB.  Number five.  Yo, Texas.  Hey.  My fault right there, man.  I ran the wrong route but I really appreciate you not throwing me underneath the bus back there, all right?

BOJOHN	No problem.

TAVARUS	Yeah.  Hey.  Tavarus, man.

BOJOHN	Bo.

TAVARUS	Hey, man.  You got a good arm.  Man, keep it up.  You'll be all right.  I never had a QB get me to rock like that, so we gonna run some more after practice next time, all right?

BOJOHN	Yeah.

TAVARUS	All right.  Cool, man.

BOJOHN	You ever been in Texas?

TAVARUS	Why, trying to go back home?

BOJOHN	No, I can't never do that.

CHRYSTAL	They're beautiful, aren't they?

COACH HARDWICK	(knocks on door) Well, your husband surely misses you.

EVA	(giggles)

COACH HARDWICK	Except it's not from your husband and you're not happy to hear from this cat.  Well, if you got a love-the-one-you're-with list, I am around.  I'm just playing.

EVA	What do you need, coach?

COACH HARDWICK	Hey, look, you know the reporter who did the Bojohn story?

EVA	Uh-hmm.

COACH HARDWICK	That's Diamond's boy.  He covers the band, not the football team.

EVA	The story was planted.

COACH HARDWICK	One hundred percent.  Hey, look, around here, men come in two flavors, hound dogs and big dogs.  Now, you pull a hound dog's tail, he'll just go and lie somewhere else.  You pull a big dog's tail, he's gonna bite you.

EVA	Thank you for the head's up.

COACH HARDWICK	Any time.

DESK CLERK	You don't have an appointment?

EVA	I don't.  My office tried but apparently had no luck.

DESK CLERK	She's the Deputy District Attorney, you don't just happen by.

EVA	Please let her know that the president of Georgia A&M would like a few minutes of her time.

LILA	Look, I wish I could help but this sounds like an administrative matter and I'm in the middle of front page murder trial.

EVA	It's not an administrative issue if he's acting outside the scope of his employment.

LILA	Okay, so you want me to do your laundry.  I go after him, prove he's acting outside of his official responsibilities, then if the family comes after the university…

EVA	They won't.  They never wanna hear Cecil Diamond's name again.  Look, I am not trying to bail out the university, I am here to behead a beast.

LILA	He's resourceful and ruthless, with very powerful friends.

LILA	Look, you're not the first to come here with allegations against him.

EVA	I bet I'm the first with a witness.

CEDRIC	(sighs) Chantel.

CHANTEL	Hey.  (giggles)

CEDRIC	Hey, what are you doing here?

CHANTEL	What you think I'm doing here?  I missed my man.

CEDRIC	How'd you swing the cash for the trip from Chicago?

CHANTEL	Like I don't know how to have a savings account.  You mad I came?

CEDRIC	Hell, no.  I'm mad we're still standing here though.

CHANTEL	Oh, I missed you.

JASON	Hey.  I've been testing you like crazy.

EVA	You need to go home.

JASON	I have told you I transferred here.

EVA	Go back to Connecticut.

JASON	Or what?

CHANTEL	(moaning)

BOJOHN	(on phone) Hello.

ALYSSA	You said you'd call every day.

BOJOHN	I know.  I'm sorry but I got mandatory studying right now.  I'll call you after.  Promise.

ALYSSA	Have a nice day.

CUSTOMER	All right.  Now, you, too.

ALYSSA	You don't keep promises, Bo.  You make new ones to replace the ones you broke.

BOJOHN	Thanks for making me feel like crap.

ALYSSA	You feel like crap?  People laugh at me for thinking you're coming back.  How you think that feels?

BOJOHN	What do you want me to say, Alyssa?

ALYSSA	Nothing.  Go.  Go ahead with your life.  I'll be here topping off gas tanks.

EVA	I'm supposed to be getting the school out of that but I can't ignore this.  I think we just have to be very careful with her, so I think the most important thing at this point is to protect these kids.

LILA	That's absolutely…

EVA	No one else to do that.  Hi, Noni.

NONI	Hi, Dr. Fletcher.

EVA	This is Deputy D.A. Standrich.

LILA	Hi.

NONI	D.A.?

EVA	Yes.  I heard you and I'm gonna do something about it.

NONI	Why would you do this?

LILA	I'm here to help, sweetie.  Why do we start at the beginning?

NONI	Beginning of what?  I…

EVA	What you told me about Ebonie having been attacked by the other band members.

NONI	Oh, no, you misunderstood me.

LILA	Noni, if you've been harassed…

NONI	I've got to go.  I should be in class right now.

EVA	Damn it.

CHANTEL	Since when'd you start going to the Center for Civil and Human Rights?

CEDRIC	Since I started trying to show you around.

CHANTEL	Hmm.  Atlanta's all right.  Maybe I should move down here.

CEDRIC	Seriously?

CHANTEL	Why you say it like that?

CEDRIC	You say you love Chicago.  I mean, all your peeps is out there.  Whoa.  Hold on.  Did somebody come at you about that shoot in the club?

CHANTEL	No.  I just miss my man, that's all.

CEDRIC	I mean, your man is just the business.

CHANTEL	Maybe when he ain't all feeling himself like he is right now.

CEDRIC	You know you like that.

CHANTEL	(laughs)

EVA	Excuse me.  Hello.

EVA	(knocks on door)

NONI	Hi, Dr. Fletcher.

EVA	Are you all right?

NONI	I can't talk right now.  I…

EVA	Noni, I'm really concerned about you.

CECIL	Oh, heck, Noni.  Madame President's concerned.  Let her in.

EVA	This is completely inappropriate.

CECIL	I told her the same thing, why I insisted the door be open.

NONI	I asked him to come.  Okay.  I have a lot of formations to learn and I can't do it without his help.

CECIL	And Lord knows I go the extra mile for my kids.

EVA	You're in the band now?

CECIL	A spot opened up.

EVA	Of course, it did.  Are you sure this is what you want?  And what about Ebonie?

NONI	It is what it is.

MAN	That's right, that's right.  Yeah.

WOMAN	Yeah.

MAN	There goes my (indistinct) right.

ALL	Yeah.

WOMAN	All right.

MAN	Yo, let's party.

ALL	(cheering)

DJ	Shout out to the Sigma Mu boys.  Let's go.

CHANTEL	I mean…

CEDRIC	Yeah, let me handle the strippers, all right?

CHANTEL	Okay.

WOMAN	Excuse me.

CEDRIC	Are you dropping that heat?  Can you check me out, bruh?

DJ	All right.

CEDRIC	Can you feel that?

CHANTEL	Hmm.  You're sexy when you're in your grind.

CEDRIC	Used to have sex.

CHANTEL	You ain't here acting like you miss me.  (laughs)

CEDRIC	Something like that.

CHANTEL	(laughs) Oh.  You want some of this?

SYDNEY	Come on.  Woo.

WOMAN	Yeah, yeah.

WOMAN	(laughs)

WOMAN	Oh.

SYDNEY	Take it off.

WOMAN	Oh, whoa.

WOMAN	Oh, work it on.  (laughs)

SYDNEY	Oh.

TAVON	Good luck, everyone.

MAN	Hey.

TAVON	You got this.  You always out.

MAN	Oh.

MAN	Beautiful.

MILES	Strip or dare?

MAN	Strip.

ALL	Strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip.  Whoa.  Oh.

MAN	Damn.

MAN	Damn.

SYDNEY	Another round, let's go.

SYDNEY	Take it off.

MAN	Oh.

MAN	Oh, man.

SYDNEY	You got one item left.

MAN	I smell his shirt.

MAN	You got a…

BRYCE	Madison?

MADISON	(breathes heavily)

BRYCE	Hey, you, you look nice.

MADISON	Thanks.  Have you seen Sydney?

BRYCE	Yeah.  She's, uh, she's inside.

MADISON	Thanks

BRYCE	All right.

MAN	All right.  Okay.

MAN	Oh.

MAN	Nope.  All right.

TAVON	Okay.

WOMAN	Okay.

TAVON	I got you this time.

MILES	Dude, you can't.

TAVON	I got you, but…

MILES	It's back around to you?

SYDNEY	Well, let's do this, old man.

MILES	Okay.  Strip…

MAN	Hmm.

MILES	…or dare?

WOMAN	Yeah.

ALL	Strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip.

ALL	Boo.

MILES	Hey, all right, all right, all right.

MAN	Oh.

MILES	All right, all right.

MAN	Hey.

MILES	I don't freshman out on me, okay?  Open mouth with tongue.

ALL	Oh.

TAVON	Oh.  (laughs)

SYDNEY	Please.

E.J.	She ain't gonna do it.

TAVON	You ain't gonna do it though.

E.J.	She's not gonna do it.

MAN	She ain't gonna…

SYDNEY	Move.

MILES	Oh.

TAVON	Oh.

E.J.	She's drunk.

ALL	Oh.

MILES	Oh.

TAVON	Oh.

MAN	Oh.

ALL	Oh.

MILES	Oh, no.

ALL	Oh.

E.J.	Yeah.

TAVON	Yeah, this is my lucky day.

E.J.	Yeah.  Man, look at you looking all thirsty.

TAVON	Man, frat, please.  You already know I can have it if I wanted.

E.J.	Hey, even Sigma Mu can't get a girl like that for a dude like you.

TERESA	She's not moving.

TAVON	Wait, what?

TERESA	Something's wrong.

MILES	Yo, freshman.  Tsk, lightweight.  Somebody find her a bed.  Let her sleep this off.

E.J.	Wait a minute.  I thought I knew her.  That's the new president's daughter, man.

MILES	Yo, chill.

MAN	Yo.

WOMAN	What?

MILES	Are you serious?

WOMAN	No.

MAN	Oh.

MADISON	Wait, what--oh, my God.  Sydney?  Sydney?  Sydney?  Wait, what happened?

MAN	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.  Take these keys and pull my car around right now.

MADISON	Sydney?

TAVON	Let's go, let's go.

MAN	We need to get out of here, man.

E.J.	Keep moving.

TAVON	Hold up, hold up.

E.J.	Hurry up.

MADISON	Someone get me a blanket or something.

MAN	No.

MADISON	Where's her shirt?  Someone--Sydney, please.

MADISON	Go ahead.  This way.  Come on.  Right here.

E.J.	Watch her head, man.

MADISON	Come on.  Keep her covered.  Keep her covered, come on.

E.J.	I got it.

MADISON	You can do this.  Hold her.

E.J.	I got you.  Come on.

MADISON	Dr. Fletcher?  Help.  Dr. Fletcher?  Come on, come on.  I got you.  I got you.  Wait.  Are you leaving?  Wait.  Oh, my God.

TAVON	Come on, man.

MADISON	We got this.

TAVON	Hurry up.  Hurry up.

MADISON	Come on.  Up, up.

E.J.	I was trying to help her get up the stairs.

MADISON	Come on.

EVA	Sydney?

MADISON	We're almost here.  No, no, no.  Stay with me.  I got you.

EVA	Sydney, baby?

MADISON	All right.  I got you.  We're almost there.

EVA	Sydney.

MADISON	Oh.

EVA	Sydney, Sydney.  Call 911.  Call 911.  Go.

MADISON	Okay.

EVA	Sydney.  Come on, baby.  Come on.  Come on.  It's gonna be okay.

DEREK	(on phone) You've reached Derek Fletcher.  Please leave a message.

EVA	Derek, it's me.  Uh, please call me back.  It's about Sydney.

EVA	Hi.

DEREK	Is Sydney okay?

EVA	Yes.  I mean, no.  She, um, she went out drinking, could've killed herself.

DEREK	What?

EVA	I called a doctor.  He took a good look at her, said she's fine.  She's sleeping.  Derek, I, um, I can't do it by myself.  Uh, we really need to deal with this as a family.

DEREK	What did the doctor say?

EVA	That she was dangerously close to alcohol poisoning.  Did you hear what I said?

DEREK	I can't get into this right now, Eva.

EVA	She needs you, Derek, and so do I.

DEREK	Now, you need me now.  But you didn't need me enough before, did you?  Or else we wouldn't be here.  Do you think pretty young things haven't throw themselves at me?  But I knew it wasn't worth my career or my family and you threw it all away. And for what? A grad student who then brag to all his friends about screwing you?

EVA	I'm sorry.  (on phone) What I did was stupid.

DEREK	I'll call Sydney tomorrow.

EVA	(sniffles) (sighs)

EVA	Hi, Crystal.

CRYSTAL	(on phone) Just got word, ma'am, you can come tomorrow.

EVA	Thank you.  That's the best news I've had all day.  Thanks.

CRYSTAL	(on phone) You're welcome.

EVA	(sighs) (weeping)

ALL	Whoa.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Bring it on.

ALL	Whoa.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Bring it on.

ALL	Whoa.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	All right, all right.  Don't let this first (indistinct) be your last.  Let's go.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Here we go.

MAN	Turn it up.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	There you go.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Come on, man.

ALL	(grunt)

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Over here.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Oh.

MAN	Go.

COACH HARDWICK	QB2.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Come on, man.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Did a good job, man.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Come on now.

ALL	(grunt)

COACH HARDWICK	Bojohn.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	(indistinct) dog.  I got you block for me, man.  You got this block up.

COACH HARDWICK	All right.  You're up QB3.  Show them what you got.

BOJOHN	Yes, sir.

COACH HARDWICK	Go and trade right, 37 book.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	All right.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	All right.

BOJOHN	We're go and trade right, 37 book on one-on-one.  Ready?

ALL	Ready.

BOJOHN	Let's go, let's go

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Come here a little bit.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	I got him, I got him.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	We got them?

BOJOHN	All right.  Yeah.  Two get, two.

ALL	(grunt) Oh.

ALL	(groan)

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Welcome to the Teradome bitch.

BOJOHN	That's how it is, yo?

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Man, he can forget about getting your job.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	(laughs)

COACH HARDWICK	Well, he can take an ass whooping, know that much.  Call a pass.

BOJOHN	Let's get this team.  All right.  We're going to trip to right, 72 panther, on 101, ready?  (claps)

BOJOHN	Take 41.  Hey, three, one, nine, three, one, nine.

BOJOHN	One, eighty, one eighty, one eighty hut.

ALL	(groaning)

BOJOHN	(grunts)

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Go back to Texas, bitch.

COACH HARDWICK	That's it.  That's it.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	We got this going, Bo.  Good pass, man.

BOJOHN	Just trying to make the team, man.

BRYCE	Check it out, a pride walk.

CEDRIC	For who?

BRYCE	The name on your dorm building.


CEDRIC	Uh, CT Vivian?

BRYCE	The legend himself.

CEDRIC	Damn, that's tight.

EVA	Gentlemen, I trust you've enjoyed your lunch.

MAN	Yes.

EVA	First, thank you, Dr. Vivian, for bringing us together on such short notice.

DR. VIVIAN	Oh, thank you, my dear.  I like the program that you laid out.

EVA	I won't take up too much of your time.  (sighs) I promised you a 10% budget cut, I am pleased to report that I've already found 12, but today, I have something else on my mind.  Young people, are flooding social media and marching in the streets because black lives matter, Ebonie Weaver's life matters, and as Dr. Vivian so famously said, "We are made by the struggles we choose." I choose to struggle right here, right now for Ebonie Weaver.

SYDNEY	Mommy, can I have a hug?

ALL	Ha.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Bring it on.

ALL	Ha.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Bring it on.

ALL	Ha.  Hey.

JUNIOR	Proud of you, bro.

BOJOHN	Appreciate it, man.  How are feeling?

JUNIOR	I'm feeling all right, man.

BOJOHN	Good, good.  (chuckles)

JUNIOR	Let coach know I was here, man, I'm gonna take a leak.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	All right.  I got you.

COACH HARDWICK	All right, all right, settle down, settle down.  Have a seat.

JUNIOR	Going to go to the bathroom, Coach.

COACH HARDWICK	Sit down.  All right, listen up.  The good news is, we're all still here.  The challenging news is, some of us are gonna play in a practice team for a while.  Bojohn Folsom, congratulations, QB2.

FOOTBALL PLAYER	Coming for you, QB1.

VERNON	Yo coach, where my name?

COACH HARDWICK	Second page, son.

VERNON	A bunch of bullshit.  (groans)

COACH HARDWICK	You keep that up, you gonna be off the team altogether.  All right.  You're all dismissed.  Go ahead and celebrate tonight, but 
not too much.

ALL	(cheering)

BOJOHN	Hey, good job, man.

TAVARUS	Thanks.

BOJOHN	Are you still checking out Jay Rav?

TAVARUS	Oh, yeah, just a bit.

BOJOHN	I'm in.

TAVARUS	All right.  See you later.

ELLA	You got this.

CECIL	You got 15 minutes.

EVA	We adjourn when I say so.  And now, we'll begin.  See how that works?  On a campus founded as a sanctuary for students who look, like, her, students who look like Ebonie Weaver nearly killed her.  What Crystal is passing out is our new code of conduct, abuse, bullying, or any conduct that compromises the well-being and safety of our students, no longer tolerated.

CECIL	To make steel, well, you have to put fire to iron, Dr. Fletcher.

EVA	Any person or group guilty of abuse or bullying will be identified and swiftly removed.

CECIL	Well, let's see how long your new and improved code of conduct last once I've talked to the trustees.

EVA	You mean the trustees' Code of Conduct.  Unanimously approved, and they've given me the authority to enforce it, completely. Any questions?

ELLA	How about a round of applause?

EVA	Thank you.  Thank you.

CARLTON	You wouldn't be sitting there having bourbon for breakfast if you checked your email.

CECIL	Left my damn phone in the car.

CARLTON	Use mine.

CECIL	I'm not in the mood for games, Carlton.

CARLTON	You're in the mood for this one.  Got this from the (indistinct) we've got the bitch.  Now, how will--how will parents feel when the woman in charge of their children's education can't even control her own?  (chuckles)

CECIL	That's a shame.

CARLTON	Excuse me.  Did you see that?

CECIL	Shame.

CARLTON	(chuckles)
