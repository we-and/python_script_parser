(Glammys School Of Fashion vlog EPS 113)

CAMI	Welcome to my vlog.. here begins a frantic day.. my life is anything but dull… surfing… earthquakes… the..oops sack races in high heels...flying electrical appliances and Niagra Falls… I really don’t have any reason to miss life in the jungle...

REBECCA	Hi girls, are you ready? 

CAMI	Oh no!!

CARMEN	Camiiii...I was forgetting about you, are you coming?

CAMI	(Reaction) As you know I am a professional model… and what a model! I even act as a a fashion consultant from time to time. 

CARMEN	Aaa I can’t find a color to go with this... Ahhh, here we go! Cami you’re wonderful.

CAMI	But my real passion is food, though.

CARMEN	Aaahhh Camiii!!

CAMI	Don’t get me wrong… I only eat natural things

CAMI	(Reaction)... (Laugh)

CARMEN	Time to go to bed now, but tomorrow we go on a diet, ok?... good night Cami

CAMI	Yeah sure. Bye from Cami’s blog.
