THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching.? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Stephen is being coupled to a long line trucks loaded with slate.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh dear, Stephen. All those trucks are far too heavy for you. Let's try uncoupling some. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	I wonder how many he can pull. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	There we are, that’s much lighter. Now you’re on your way. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	How many trucks full of stone did Stephen manage to pull? Was it one? Was it two? Or was it three!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Stephen pulled one truck full of stone! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	I'm not sure pulling stone is the job for Stephen. He's happiest pulling carriages full of people.

THE EARL OF SODOR	HOORAY! That was fun. Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oops! Kevin has fallen into the water.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Luckily Cranky is on hand to lend a hook! What’s that on Kevin’s face? <chuckles> It’s pinched his nose. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	What kind of creature was on Kevin's nose? Was it a fish? Was it a crab? Or was it a starfish?

THE EARL OF SODOR	A crab was on Kevin's nose. The Fat Controller was very pleased with Kevin and Cranky for working together to tidy the dockside.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Jolly Well done! Do come back again soon. Goodbye!
