STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always longed to travel and see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...
STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!
	
STORYTELLER	Really Useful around the World!
	
STORYTELLER	Thomas in the Sahara.
	
STORYTELLER	Thomas was pulling a goods train across the Sahara.
	
STORYTELLER	It was very hot and dry in the desert. And there wasn’t a cloud in the sky.

STORYTELLER	Pulling trucks in the hot sun was thirsty work. Thomas’s water tank was as dry as old sticks.

STORYTELLER	And that’s when he saw a long line of strange-looking animals.

STORYTELLER	“Wow!” Said Thomas. “I wonder how they keep going without any water?” Thomas slowed down to get a better look.

STORYTELLER	“Hello, my name is Thomas”

STORYTELLER	“My name is Monyyak,” said the man with the animals. “And these are my camels.”

STORYTELLER	“They have funny-looking steam domes!” he said.

STORYTELLER	Monyyak laughed! “They’re not steam domes – they’re humps!”

STORYTELLER	And Monyyak explained that camels carry water in their humps.

STORYTELLER	“I carry water in my tanks!” said Thomas. “But they’re nearly empty.” And that’s when Monyyak told Thomas about the oasis.

STORYTELLER	“It’s not far ahead,” said Monyyak. “And you can get water there.”

STORYTELLER	Thomas thanked the man with the camels – and sped off towards 

STORYTELLER	The oasis! “What a refreshing sight!” said Thomas.

STORYTELLER	Thomas drank and drank... 

STORYTELLER	until, at last, his tank was full! But then there was trouble!

STORYTELLER	“What happened to the oasis?” said Monyyak. “There is barely enough water for the camels!”

STORYTELLER	“don’t camels have water... in their humps?” said Thomas.

STORYTELLER	“Yes,” said Monyyak, “But they need to fill up too!” Thomas didn’t know what to do.

STORYTELLER	But then an idea flew into his funnel!
	
STORYTELLER	“Look at me!” said Thomas. “A real camel train!”
