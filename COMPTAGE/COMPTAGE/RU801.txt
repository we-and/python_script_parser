NAOMI	I am Naomi Smalls, and I am  years old. Check your lipstick before you come for me. Naomi is a tall glass of water. She has legs all the way up to her asshole. I got my drag name from Naomi Campbell and Biggie Smalls. First one, I don't blame them. I'm obsessed with 's supermodels. I'm gonna set myself right in the center. Yeah, spotlight on me. (laughs) Naomi is a fashion girl. She's [bleep] fierce.

CYNTHIA	How you doing mis amores? Do you want to see my cuckoo?

NAOMI	(laughs)

CYNTHIA	My name is Cynthia Lee Fontaine. How are you? I'm from Puerto Rico, but I live in Austin, Texas, y'all. I call myself between pageant queen and perform 'cause I do comedy, I do campy sometimes.

NAOMI	Sometimes?

CYNTHIA	You know. (laughs) I'm sexy as a goddess is and funny as a clown. Are you ready for me? Oh, my God, the room is huge. Fantastic, so my cuckoo have a space. I need a space for this junk in the trunk.

DAX	What's up, nerds.

CYNTHIA	Ah!

DAX	My name is Dax ExclamationPoint, and I am the queen of all nerds.

NAOMI	It's Storm.

DAX	I'm a cosplayer, and my look is very inspired by, like, science fiction and comics. Superheroes. Just strong, bad bitches who don't take any crap from anybody else. You know what? I'm gonna sit 'cause my cats are growling. So I'm just gonna sit right here.

CYNTHIA	Okay.

DAX	Can I get some brunch?

NAOMI	(laughs)

NAYSHA	Hola. The beauty is here. My name is Naysha Lopez. I think the most important element of my drag has to be appearance. It sounds so shallow, but my drag is flawless. It's gorgeous. It's stunning. It's gorgeous. It's everything. Did I say it was stunning and gorgeous? Did I say that already? Okay.

CYNTHIA	Naysha is here! Yes, my sister! Whoo! Continental sisters.

NAYSHA	Oh, yeah. (laughs)

DAX	So you're Puerto Rico also, or from Austin?

NAYSHA	I'm originally from Puerto Rico, but, um, I live in Chicago.

CYNTHIA	(whistling) That's a little frog in Puerto Rico. They are so annoying.

NAYSHA	I love me some Cynthia.

CYNTHIA	(whistles)

NAYSHA	You don't even understand what she's saying, but you don't really care.

CYNTHIA	(whistles)

NAYSHA	Oh!

NAOMI	Oh!

ACID BETTY	No need to adjust your TV sets. This acid trip is all real.

ACID BETTY	Watch out, bitches. Here's Acid Betty from Brooklyn, New York. My drag style is completely over-the-top. Basically, a drug trip without the drugs. I kind of want to run around. (laughs) The main bullet point of Acid Betty is she's a bitch. That's it. Even Bianca won't [bleep] with her. That's the T. Wait, I want to put my stink all over this place. I'm excited to be here. Come on, like, before we all hate each other.

ROBBIE	Good morning. I didn't realize this was happening today. My name is Robbie Turner, and I'm the kindest queen you'll ever meet. I'm trying to give old classic Hollywood. Rita Hayworth hair, Jean Harlow robe. Gorgeous.

NAOMI	How long you been doing drag for?

ROBBIE	Going on .

ACID BETTY	 years of drag?

ROBBIE	I know, can you imagine? I'm only .

ACID BETTY	You don't look old.

ROBBIE	I know I don't.

NAOMI	Yes!

DAX	Oh!

NAOMI	Yay!

ROBBIE	Oh, Kim Chi!

KIM CHI	I came to chop suey the competition. My name is Kim Chi, and I came here to destroy everyone...with my makeup. I'm known for crazy, over-the-top, pure anime fantasy. Oh, my God.

NAOMI	Hi, I'm Naomi. This is beautiful. Seeing Kim Chi on Instagram for so long, double-tapping everything, I'm [bleep] starstruck.

KIM CHI	I want to go subtle with everything, so. I may come across as shy because I'm soft-spoken, but... donut come for me, because I'll destroy you. Get it, "donut"? (laughing)

THORGY	Whoo! Thorgy with a T-H and orgy, and I feel incredible. My name is Thorgy, and I'm  years old. I'm not  years old. Where did that come from? I'm colorful, I'm fun, and I'm a fashion clown. Whoo!

ACID BETTY	O-M-baby Jesus.

THORGY	My drag style is kind of incredibly eclectic. I can be campy, but also I can be, like, [bleep] fierce.

THORGY	Hi, guys!

ACID BETTY	 [bleep] you, Thorgy.

THORGY	I know Acid Betty very well. Lord, it's gonna be the [bleep]show. She's gonna be a lot. She's gonna be extra.

ACID BETTY	Oh, really?

THORGY	She's gonna be a diva.

DAX	Ooh!

CYNTHIA	Girl.

ACID BETTY	NY in the house.

BOB	My name is Bob The Drag Queen, and I am  years old. My drag is funny. It's irreverent. What you see is what you get. My bodysuit says it all. You're welcome.

ACID BETTY	Yes!

NAYSHA	Take it!

THORGY	Yeah!

BOB	(screams)

THORGY	Yeah!

BOB	I'm hilarious, beautiful, talented, and humble. How are you? Now just one more.

ROBBIE	The New York girls, they get really excited. And they just talk over one another.

ACID BETTY	Thorgy, you are--

BOB	Whoo!

ACID BETTY	Take it.

THORGY	Yeah, yeah, yeah!

ROBBIE	Too real.

BOB	New York, New York, New York, yeah, girl.

ROBBIE	Oh.

BOB	Maybe some of the other queens are, like, resentful that there's so much New York City representation. There's a reason New York City has some of the best drag queens in the world, and that is a fact. This is a gag.

ACID BETTY	The children don't even know.

LAILA	All right, ladies. Let's turn up the juice and see what shakes loose.

BOB	Uh-oh, this is trouble.

ROBBIE	Don't say "Beetlejuice" three times.

LAILA	I'm Laila McQueen, and I'm  years old. Laila is like a whorey, quasi-rock star. I don't want to say gothy, but, like, gothy.

ALL	Hi.

THORGY	You had the smart idea.

ROBBIE	I'm gonna tell you a story about flats. No.

THORGY	 hours from now, we're all like, "Ugh, ow!"

BOB	She's like Sketchers, it's the S.

CHI CHI	Laissez les bon temps roulez.

DAX	What'd she say?

CHI CHI	My name is Chi Chi DeVayne, and I don't get ready, I stay ready.

DRAG QUEEN	Oh!

NAYSHA	Hey!

CHI CHI	My drag is that real Southern dragged out style of drag. Creole fish. It's like a whole nother level of drag right here. If you made it to "RuPaul's Drag Race," you made it, honey.

NAYSHA	Tell us about yourself.

CHI CHI	Well, I'm a cheap queen.

LAILA	She's on a budget.

CHI CHI	Um, I don't mean cheap.

THORGY	Resourceful.

CHI CHI	Yeah, resourceful.

ROBBIE	Chi Chi walked in in a trash bag. Chi Chi will take herself out in a trash bag.

DERRICK	It's Derrick, bitch.

ACID BETTY	Yeah!

DERRICK	My name is Derrick Barry. I'm  years old. I may look angelic, but I am not that innocent. I'm a Britney Spears impersonator. I impersonate her six nights a week on the Las Vegas Strip. I would love to believe that I'm the best Britney in the world. That's what people say.

ROBBIE	Derrick, I'm so [bleep] excited.

DERRICK	Hey!

ROBBIE	How are you?

LAILA	Derrick Barry is huge competition. She is a quasi-celebrity.

DERRICK	Okay, I want to know who else did this. Who else has been carb-free for two weeks? 

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

RUPAUL	Beautiful. Welcome, ladies.

DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Now, are you ready to make "herstory"?

ALL	Yes!

RUPAUL	Well, guess what? You already have. This is the th episode of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

RUPAUL	Now, an occasion such as this demands to be acknowledged on an epic scale. So I've arranged a photo shoot with some extra special guest stars. I hope you're ready for your close-up because if you get upstaged, this th episode could be your last.

RUPAUL	Now, let's go.

MATHU	Just keeping it editorial, real and art.

RUPAUL	Yes. Acid Betty, we will see if you have what it takes to sit among the goddesses, all right?

ACID BETTY	Yes, RuPaul, very intimidating. Sitting next to these wannabe-ass drag queens.

RUPAUL	Well, you passed the acid test, Betty. Come through, Kim Chi. Yes, give me anime-azing. Go big, Naomi Smalls. Oh, all of that right there.

VIOLET	Naomi Smalls looks really hot, but she does have cliff hangers. You see her toes, like, literally clinging onto the shoe. Boner killer.

MATHU	Show me the winner.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turner.

SHARON	[stammering] This sleeve happens to be in my light, darling.

MATHU	You remind me of a dog trying to get comfortable on the couch.

LAILA	Everyone is so gorgeous, and here I am looking like a Beetlejuice trash bag. Oh, my God.

MATHU	She's like the Hamburglar scurrying around behind people.

RUPAUL	Earn those stripes, girl. From Las Vegas, Nevada, Derrick Barry.

MATHU	That's it, make them your backup dancers.

RUPAUL	Yes. This is the last shot. Hit me, baby, one more time. Oh, she's toxic. Coming up, each of you will be assigned a legendary design challenge from a past season.
DERRICK	Ugh.

NAOMI	Derrick Barry is not creative. He will definitely have the hardest time with this challenge.

DERRICK	(squeals)

RUPAUL	Ladies, over the past  episodes, I'm sure you've yelled at your TV, "Girl, I coulda slayed that challenge." Now it's your chance to prove it. For this week's maxi challenge, each of you will be assigned a legendary design challenge from a past season. It's your job to take the materials and make them your own. To assign the looks, I'll choose one of your names at random.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turner.

RUPAUL	Now, Robbie, you get to assign all the queens' looks and choose your own. It's time to bring back my girls. From season one, Shannel, presenting the Drag on a Dime thrift store challenge. Latrice Royale, presenting our Pride Float challenge from season four. Next, Violet Chachki, presenting the Money Ball from season three. It's time to assign these three looks. All right, Robbie Turner, who gets Drag on a Dime?

ROBBIE	Naysha.

RUPAUL	Who gets Float Your Boat?

DAX	(gasps) Meow.

BOB	Yes.

RUPAUL	Who's gonna get a big Christmas package?

ROBBIE	Derrick Barry.

DERRICK	Yes.

RUPAUL	And, Robbie, does this mean you're going to be doing it doggy style?

ROBBIE	Can you believe I forget to pick a theme for myself? Guess who gets stuck with the poodle? (sighs)

RUPAUL	Now if I've said this once, I've said it  times. Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.


KIM CHI	Yeah!

BOB	All right!

KIM CHI	Oh, my God.

BOB	Let's do it.

CYNTHIA	All right, this is kind of interesting.

THORGY	I'm super excited about this challenge because I've watched every episode and I can kill any one of these challenges. Whoo, this is fun.

ROBBIE	Oh, these are [bleep] bags. (laughs) So I'm looking through my materials and I realize that a lot of these things can't be made into clothing. Dog chew toys, ropes. You guys, I brought treats.

ACID BETTY	(laughs) Dog treats.

ROBBIE	It's just a couple of treats.

CHI CHI	Have you ever tasted one of those for real? They're actually good. You know, I'm from the South, we eat everything, honey. Possums, rats, raccoons.

ROBBIE	Possums?

BOB	Chi Chi's a [bleep] bumpkin. She's just country as [bleep] catfish sandwiches. She's like country.

NAYSHA	There's so much stuff that I'm trying not to get overwhelmed and like, I got this and this and this and this and this. I don't do drag on a dime. I don't sew. I'm a pageant girl. I brought so many beautiful garments. I spend money.

CHI CHI	Make it work, bitch. Make it work.

DERRICK	There's so much stuff to use. My theme for the challenge is The Queen Who Mopped Christmas. Oh, my God. (exhales) My strategy for this first challenge is to basically still come out with my Britney look. Like, I just want to add to it.

NAOMI	So what kind of vibe are you going for?

DERRICK	Like, this Christmas skirt. Like a tree skirt, but then I don't know how to finish a whole outfit. Girl.

NAOMI	Derrick Barry is not creative, obviously because he's impersonating someone else his whole life. He will definitely have the hardest time with this challenge.

DERRICK	And I'm like stuck on what to do for the top. (groans)

RUPAUL	Coming up...

CHI CHI	(gasps) My [bleep] panties just ripped. This some bull [bleep].

BOB	I have no clue how she's gonna fix this outfit. I think she's done.

CHI CHI	 [bleep].

NAYSHA	I actually do a lot of pageants, and I won this pageant. It's an international pageant. It's called Miss Continental and it is one of the most prestigious pageants.

CHI CHI	I've heard of it.

NAYSHA	Yeah, so I'm a former Miss Continental.

THORGY	That's awesome.

NAYSHA	Yeah.

CHI CHI	I hate pageants. Girl, I've done, like, two pageants.

NAYSHA	And you didn't win them and that's why you hate pageants.

CHI CHI	Exactly.

NAYSHA	I knew it. I knew it. That always happens to someone who don't win.

CHI CHI	Bitch, I was robbed.

NAYSHA	It just sucks that pageants get such a bad rap. I owe a whole lot of my work ethic and who I am to pageant experiences.

BOB	So, Derrick, how long have you been doing Britney?

DERRICK	I started on Halloween .

BOB	And how long you been doing drag?

DERRICK	Halloween . I've been doing Britney for  years and I think a lot of other girls are not going to think I can do anything else. I have to prove that I can do more than Britney.

BOB	I find there's two breeds of queen. There's Halloween queens and there's pride queens. I was a pride queen.

DERRICK	Really?

BOB	I, like, started drag on Gay Pride wearing, like, [bleep] potato sack and a wig from, you know, who knows where.

LAILA	Was that this Pride?

BOB	How dare you?

BOB	Oh you little bitch.

ROBBIE	Oh, Laila! How long have you been doing drag?

KIM CHI	I've been doing drag for two and a half years.

ROBBIE	Does your family support your drag?

KIM CHI	My family doesn't know that I do drag.

ROBBIE	They don't know?

ACID BETTY	Really?

KIM CHI	No.

ROBBIE	At all?

KIM CHI	Like, my mom thinks I'm a makeup artist.

ROBBIE	Has your mother ever seen you in drag ever, like pictures or anything?

KIM CHI	Well, I've shown her pictures of me in drag and she thinks they're, like, makeup jobs that I did. She doesn't recognize that it's me.

ACID BETTY	Stop.

ROBBIE	Really?

KIM CHI	Yeah. I guess I'm worried about my mom finding out that I do drag because growing up, I always felt like I could never be a model child that all Asian mothers want. I've already disappointed her so many times in her life. She could even stop talking to me. And... And you know, I'm just scared of letting her down again.

CHI CH	(gasps)

BOB	What's the matter, girl? Speak it out.

CHI CHI	I go to put on my outfit and what happens? Pop. My outfit has just ripped apart. This some bull [bleep]. My [bleep] panties just ripped at the last second. And it's all coming apart. This some bull [bleep]. [bleep]. I am going into panic mode right now. Girl, you cannot go home, not on the first day. I want this so freaking bad. Like, I'm so distraught, I don't even know what I'm doing now.

BOB	I have no clue how she's gonna fix this outfit. I think she's done. I hope you know the lip synch song, 'cause your outfit is crumbling before your hands.

CHI CHI	[bleep].

RUPAUL	Cover girl, put the bass in your walk. Head to toe let your whole body talk. And what.

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "RuPaul's Drag Race." Michelle Visage, happy th.

MICHELLE	Happy birthday, gorgeous.

RUPAUL	Style superstar, Carson Kressley.

CARSON	You look amazing for .

RUPAUL	I know, I don't look a day over .

RUPAUL	And the straight talking, Ross Mathews. Now, on a scale from one to , how excited are you?

ROSS	Like, a dragzillion.

RUPAUL	And the fabulous Nicole Richie. Hey, kitty girl.

NICHOLE	Hi, gorge. Your dress is very "Wizard of Oz."

RUPAUL	Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

NICOLE	Or a sandwich.

RUPAUL	This week, our queens posed with Drag Race champions. And tonight, they're debuting their own creations based on a design challenge from the anals of "RuPaul's Drag Race." Michelle, did I say that right?

MICHELLE	Eh.

RUPAUL	Eh, close enough. Gentlemen, start your engines and may the best woman win.

RUPAUL	The realness.

RUPAUL	First up, Acid Betty, Money Ball. Well, bitch better have my money.

ACID BETTY	I do freaky drag, and I think I do it the best. The drag scene should not be homogenized. Therefore, Acid Betty is here to represent.

NICOLE	Whoa, whoa, whoa, make it rain.

RUPAUL	Cash is queen, I own everything. Bob The Drag Queen, Gone with The Window.

CARSON	Yes, honey, lead with the bag. I love it.

BOB	This outfit shows I have the ability to make a finished garment. The fabric is hideous, but the construction is everything.

RUPAUL	No shade, but that dress looks like it was made out of curtains.

MICHELLE	Frankly, my dear, I don't give a dental dam.

RUPAUL	Dax ExclamationPoint, Hello Kitty.

CARSON	Hello, Herve Leger.

MICHELLE	Hello, Angeline.

RUPAUL	Meow.

DAX	This outfit is totally me. I love Hello Kitty. Anything a -year-old Asian girl wants, I want it more.

RUPAUL	I do love a pink [bleep].

NICOLE	It's better than a purple one.

CARSON	Why it got to be purple?

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez, Drag on a Dime.

MICHELLE	Fashion sure is changing.

NAYSHA	I am serving Greek goddess. Face, body, glamour.

MICHELLE	Peek-a-Ru, I see you.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

MICHELLE	A dress that makes cents. Not dollars.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi, Hair Ball.

MICHELLE	(clears throat) (laughs)

ROSS	You got a little--

KIM CHI	I made a lion outfit inspired by Givenchy. I turned these ratty, dirty blonde wigs into a golden treasure. This outfit is big, grand, and conceptual. It's Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	She stepped that pussy up.

ROSS	Meow.

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee Fontaine, Sugar Ball.

MICHELLE	Gumdrop it like it's hot.

CYNTHIA	I feel like a goddess of the snow. It's sugar, azúcar. Are you ready for my cuckoo? Yeah.

RUPAUL	Yes. Now see, that's the real sugar right there.

MICHELLE	That's her sugar walls.

NICOLE	Whoa!

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls, Float Your Boat.

CARSON	Washington's cross-dressing the Delaware.

NICOLE	She has my dream chest.

CARSON	Yeah.

NAOMI	I'm trying to give you 's supermodel walk and this boat is covering half of it. When I can finally step out of this boat, that's when the judges can really see the true Naomi Smalls.

RUPAUL	Land ho.

NAOMI	I am giving you Naomi Campbell strutting down a Versace runway.

RUPAUL	That boat looks heavy. Aren't there any seamen to help her?

ROSS	The seamen are all below deck.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne, Glitter Ball.

CARSON	You know I always say, when life hands you disco balls...

RUPAUL	What do you do?

MICHELLE	You make an outfit.

CARSON	Yeah.

CHI CHI	After my little meltdown, I'm just gonna roll with the punches and I'm really feeling this disco queen kind of vibe. It's a dream come true.

MICHELLE	That's a disco ball? I thought that was a fabulous globe.

RUPAUL	Yes.

CARSON	Balls to the walls.

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor, Red Velvet Cake Couture.

NICOLE	This is feeling a little menstrual.

RUPAUL	I'm glad you said it and I didn't.

THORGY	I don't wear gowns, but for this challenge I just wanted to feel decadent and I still kept with my cartoon hair, giving you cream cheese realness.

RUPAUL	Oh!

MICHELLE	Happy birthday!

RUPAUL	Have her cake and serve it too. Robbie Turner, Bitch Ball. Who let the dogs out?

NICOLE	I love two bitches on a runway.

ROBBIE	I think I'm looking more like a sheep than a poodle. The dog is looking at me like, "Get me the [bleep] out of here." I'm looking at the dog like, "Get me the [bleep] out of here." This is not going well.

ROSS	I give this look about a canine out of ten.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh, she's spayed, and she's throwing shade.

NICOLE	Both those bitches are over it.


RUPAUL	Derrick Barry, The Queen Who Mopped Christmas.

DERRICK	Well, hey, y'all. I'm giving you Christmas in Vegas. I'm serving body, but I'm also giving comedy.

NICOLE	Whoa!

ROSS	Ho, ho, ho.

MICHELLE	She's trimming her bush.

RUPAUL	Is that mistletoe or camel toe?

NICOLE	I respect that.

CARSON	She's putting the X back in Xmas.

RUPAUL	Yes, she is.

MICHELLE	Oops, she's doing it again.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen, Apocalyptic Couture. Now, her pussy's not on fire, but her shoulder is.

LAILA	This look is classic Laila. I'm loving this cute little jacket I made. I'm giving you, like, a post-apocalyptic, like, devil commander, like, the world is over and I'm here to take over.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen, Beyond Thunderdome.

RUPAUL	The realness.

RUPAUL	Welcome, ladies. When I call your name, please step forward. Bob The Drag Queen. Dax ExclamationPoint. Cynthia Lee Fontaine. Chi Chi DeVayne. Thorgy Thor. You are all... Safe. Now, you may leave the stage. Ladies, you represent the tops and the bottoms of the week. Now it's time for the judges' critiques. Acid Betty.

MICHELLE	I love that you're different. Every inch was kind of covered with a thought. To me, that's what drag is about.

CARSON	And then the photo, you seem like you're a little bit more of the avant-garde, artsy, like, you're giving me Tunnel . I was there.

ACID BETTY	I might've seen you there.

CARSON	You might've. Great job.

RUPAUL	Next up, Naysha Lopez.

NICOLE	You're gorgeous.

NAYSHA	Thank you.

NICOLE	You're giving me Eva Longoria, Miss America.

CARSON	I think, Naysha, you're beautiful, but when you're part of an ensemble photo, you really want to stand out. The dark hair and the dark top, I don't think it works in this picture.

ROSS	That big gold piece just makes you look thick, and I just don't think it looks good.

NAYSHA	This is actually the first garment I've ever made. I don't really sew.

RUPAUL	All right, well, thank you very much. Next up, Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	Hi.

CARSON	Your photo, it's pretty fabulous. And I really like your runway look. You are giving me, like, this Cowardly Lion anime ferociousness. I think it totally worked.

MICHELLE	I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and say the walk was a character choice.

KIM CHI	In my personal eyes, I'm an anime character who works as a high fashion model.

MICHELLE	You're just a total nerd.

KIM CHI	I am.

MICHELLE	I love that.

NICOLE	And by the way, I like that you kept your areolas bald. The breasts are the windows to the soul, for sure.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Kim Chi. Next up, Naomi Smalls.

NICOLE	I love that you are rocking a boy chest. You're giving me like, 's "Studio ."

MICHELLE	The Pride Float was beautifully decorated, but it became really cumbersome. And I almost saw you thinking, "I have to get back in that boat and strap it on." And I'm saying that about the boat.

RUPAUL	Yeah, I know, how many times have you said that in your life?

MICHELLE	Girl.

RUPAUL	Yeah.

ROSS	But the picture. Hello?

RUPAUL	And it's a big butt.

CARSON	I believe they call that serving it.

RUPAUL	Okay.

MICHELLE	That needs to come through with everything that you do, whether you're dragging a -pound boat with you or not.

RUPAUL	Next up, Robbie Turner.

ROSS	Your photo, I loved, because you're giving me kind of funny glamour there.

MICHELLE	You chose fur?

ROBBIE	It's like a fringe.

MICHELLE	Fringy kind of carpety-looking stuff. You're literally a blob. We lose all shape and from the side, it's even worse.

RUPAUL	And you got to choose your challenge.

ROBBIE	I actually forgot that I--to choose one for myself. I didn't have my 's dress pattern, but I was trying to figure it out. So, it was like a series of misfortunate events.

RUPAUL	All right, well, thank you very much, Robbie Turner. Next up, Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	Your look tonight, it's adorable. I will say it's pretty simple.

CARSON	I like the comedic moment where you trimmed your holiday bush. And then your photo, like, everyone in this photo looks like they're your backup dancers and you're the star.

DERRICK	Wow.

MICHELLE	We've seen Britney now. My personal challenge to you is to show me everything else but Britney.

DERRICK	Okay.

RUPAUL	We love your Britney. I do want to see more of it, but we do want to see other things. Up next, Laila McQueen.

NICOLE	Hi, Laila.

LAILA	Hey, bitch.

NICOLE	I love the shoulder detail.

MICHELLE	Did you sew that?

LAILA	I sewed the jacket, yes.

MICHELLE	That's pretty impressive.

LAILA	Thank you.

MICHELLE	But I felt like the bottom half was just a cop out.

CARSON	To me, it's just like, Wynonna Judd opened the oven too quickly and got a little, like, you know, burnt on the outside.

MICHELLE	In the picture we lose you crumpling up into a ball. You're with all these kind of legendary people, and it's almost like your body's saying "I'm not worthy."

RUPAUL	Do you think that your missteps would warrant you in the bottom?

LAILA	I don't think that I am... the least put together.

RUPAUL	Who do you think is the least put together?

LAILA	I think Naomi. Her look is very plain.

RUPAUL	Do you agree with that, Naomi?

NAOMI	No. I tried to take something that was from a past season and make it new and fresh.

RUPAUL	Well, thank you, ladies. I think we've heard enough. While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.

RUPAUL	Alright now, just between us squirrel friends, what do you think? Let's start with Acid Betty.

ROSS	In the photo she looks great, but she is this punk girl. Like, give me a little screaming... Ahh! Tongue out punkness.

CARSON	I don't hate her photo, and like her name implies, she's kind of a trip and she's a little East Village.

RUPAUL	Well, you know, I did a lot of antacid in the 's and I think that Acid Betty really represents that.

RUPAUL	Alright, Naysha Lopez.

NICOLE	Her photo, unfortunately, I think she got lost.

ROSS	And also, don't stand on that stage and tell us it's the first dress you made.

RUPAUL	I mean, this is not the place you make your first dress.

MICHELLE	Girl.

RUPAUL	You make your first dress when you learn that you're gonna come on the show.

CARSON	Or you make them when your mom's at work and you're in the sixth grade.

RUPAUL	All right, next up, Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	I love the photograph. She was kind of the queen of the castle in this anime jungle. Everything about her tonight made me happy, except for that lumbering walk.

RUPAUL	Right, because she was serving a little bit of Sasquatch on the runway.

ROSS	Sasquatch that walk.

MICHELLE	You can say Yeti that walk.

ROSS	Yeti that walk.

RUPAUL	Next up, Naomi Smalls.

MICHELLE	All I saw was a really tiny thing lumbering with a heavy ass boat.

CARSON	I kind of like the contrast of her like, fumbling with the boat. It's like a cartoon of an ant carrying a giant piece of cheese.

RUPAUL	Yeah.

MICHELLE	Well, that's the picture of the day. It says, "bow down, bitches." If she doesn't bring the photo her to this her, to me, she's gone.

RUPAUL	Moving on down to Robbie Turner.

CARSON	This look in her photo is probably her go-to look. It's that Carole Lombard meets Carol Burnett.

ROSS	But what we saw today was basic.

RUPAUL	She said she forgot to choose a category for herself.

MICHELLE	If she put any creativity into that, she could've turned it out. And that's a shame, because I like what I saw in the picture.

RUPAUL	Let's move on down to Derrick Barry.

NICOLE	Her Britney is amazing.

CARSON	You know he can nail the Britney thing. I mean, the photo was phenomenal.

MICHELLE	I'm glad she brought it the first episode. Now bring Derrick Barry to the table.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen.

MICHELLE	She did the most basic bottom half to that. I expect so much more.

NICOLE	This is season eight, and the bar has been raised so high. There was just nothing standing out for me.

ROSS	The worst picture of the week, by far, but I find her interesting because she is an artist. That warrants a second chance to me.

RUPAUL	Silence. I've made my decision. Bring back my girls.

RUPAUL	Welcome back, ladies. I've made some decisions.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty... you're safe.

ACID BETTY	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi, your photo and main stage presentation wigged us out. Condragulations, you're the winner of this week's challenge.

KIM CHI	Oh, my God.

RUPAUL	You've won $, from selfieonastick.com. The original and the best selfie on a stick. Say hi, everybody. Cheese.

KIM CHI	Bitch, I just won $,. This win means I have a place in this competition, and I am a force to be reckoned with.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry, you're safe.

DERRICK	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls, you're safe.

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez, you are gorgeous, but...

NAYSHA	Thank you.

RUPAUL	The judges felt shortchanged by your Drag on a Dime. I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.

NAYSHA	I am absolutely gagging. I don't deserve to be in the bottom two. You have some queen rocking this $ dress. I-I don't get it.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turner, your photo was iconic, but on the main stage, you screwed the pooch. Laila McQueen, you are an edgy artist, but your photo and your Post Apocalyptic Couture were not earth-shattering. Robbie Turner... You're safe.

DRAG QUEEN	Oh.

DRAG QUEEN	All right.

DRAG QUEEN	Wow.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen, I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.

LAILA	My heart drops, but I'm not gonna be the first one to go home. I'm gonna do every kind of quasi-gimmick I have.

RUPAUL	Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination.

RUPAUL	The time has come...

RUPAUL	For you to lip-synch for your life.

RUPAUL	Good luck, and don't [bleep] it up.

LADY GAGA	I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong. To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?" If only fame had an I.V., baby, could I bear being away from you. I found the vein, put it in here I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause. Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me. The applause, applause, applause. Give me the thing that I love. Turn the lights on. Put your hands up, make them touch. Make it real loud.

CYNTHIA	Naysha is always giving like, beautiful, sexy, J.Lo boom shell, I feel it.

LADY GAGA	Ooh. Touch, touch. Ooh. Touch, touch.

THORGY	Laila is giving you sex on a stick and it's awesome. She is looking so good right now throwing her body all over the floor.

LADY GAGA	I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause, applause, applause. Give me the thing that I love. Turn the lights on. Put your hands up, make them touch, touch. Make it real loud. Put your hands up, make them touch, touch. A-R-T-P-O-P.

MICHELLE	Good job!

RUPAUL	Ladies, I've made my decision.

RUPAUL	Laila McQueen, shantay, you stay. You may join the other girls.

LAILA	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez, out of  queens, you are by far one of the most beautiful to grace the stage.

NAYSHA	Thank you, Ru.

RUPAUL	And I'm sorry to see you go so soon.

NAYSHA	I'm sorry that I wasn't able to show you everything that I had to offer. Thank you, Ru, for this opportunity.

RUPAUL	Thank you. Now, sashay away.

NAYSHA	I am first to go, and I feel like I didn't let Ru see what I'm all about because there's so much more to me. Ru, I want to thank you for the platform that you have given me because not everyone appreciates it. I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart.

RUPAUL	Well, condragulations, ladies. And remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else? Can I get an "amen" in here?

ALL	Amen.

RUPAUL	Alright, now let the music play.

RUPAUL	Dance for life. Die tomorrow. Live tonight. Die tomorrow. Live tonight. Die tomorrow. Dance tonight.
