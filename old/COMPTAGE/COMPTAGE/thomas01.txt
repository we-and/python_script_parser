(WHO'S GEOFFREY?)

THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	Being honest. 

THOMAS	When I caused an accident at Brendam Docks I didn't want to get into trouble. So I blamed an engine called 'Geoffrey'.

THOMAS	But 'Geoffrey' didn't exist. I'd made him up so he could take the blame for causing the accident instead of me.

THOMAS	But that made the problem even worse... Because everyone wanted to meet Geoffrey! So I hid in a tunnel, and pretended to be Geoffrey!

THOMAS	Then there was trouble...

THOMAS	Spencer came rushing into the tunnel and nearly crashed into me!

THOMAS	Lying about my accident had made things worse. The Fat Controller told me that everyone makes mistakes. But that it's important to tell the truth and own up to them.

THOMAS	That's why being honest is the right thing to do!
