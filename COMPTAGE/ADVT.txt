(THE ADVENTURE CLUB – TRAILER)



RICKY	Mom? Do you think Grandpa really went on all of his adventures?

JANE	Oh yeah, he travelled all over the world. 

RiCKY	Do you think I could ever be like him?

JANE	Do you remember what granddad used to always say? That the key to adventure is always right in front of you.

RICKY	I found this hidden in my grandpa's old desk. Why would he go through the trouble of hiding this if it wasn't something really special? This could be the ultimate adventure.

MARTIN	The kid found something, he said it belonged to his grandfather.

LANGLEY	His grandafather?

MARTIN	I'll find out more information.

LANGLEY	You better. Because that thing is priceless, remember.

OZZIE	In ancient times, magic wish boxes were believed to grant wishes to whoever was fortunate enough to find it and lay hands upon it. Any wish, no matter how outlandish.

RICKY	But I wanna wish for something that's not selfish.

BILL	I don't know dude, I don't want to get in trouble.

SANDY	Me neither.

RICKY	But that's the risk that every great adventurer takes.

SANDY	Hey! Somebody's been here!

RICKY	We've got to save the science museum before it's too late.

BULLY KID	It's already too late.

BILL	Go get 'em, Ricky!

OZZIE	There are people out there that will stop at nothing to get their hands on one.

MARTIN	That wish box is mine.
