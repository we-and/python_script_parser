HENRY WILCOX	You blew through your allotment quickly.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Because my expenses added up quickly.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	Would you care to reveal those expenses?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Apart from my usual, I hosted a benefit for the hungry.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	The press called that a party at Patrice's

MELINDA CHARLESTON	where you and your friends broke two chandeliers,

MELINDA CHARLESTON	damages totaling thirtyfive thousand dollars.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It got a little out of hand.

HENRY WILCOX	At a fivestar restaurant?

HENRY WILCOX	And I suspect that your friends were the hungry who benefited.

HENRY WILCOX	We've been appointed to make sure your money lasts.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	Which it won't, if we allow you to keep wasting it.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Food and clothes  those are necessities.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	Threehundred dollars on a scarf?  Twentyfive hundred dollars on a hand bag?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Uncle Lyle, don't you think that mommy and daddy would want me to be happy?

LYLE ELLIOTT	Yes, of course.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Then how can I be happy if I'm broke?

HENRY WILCOX	Happiness doesn't depend on how much you spend.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Look, the party

MELINDA CHARLESTON	I thought you called it a benefit

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	...was a mistake. But it's in the past.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	It was two weeks ago.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Look, I promise from now on I will be so much better.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I know you will.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	To Uncle Lyle! Yay, cheers!

CHLOE	Ew, why do you keep inviting her?

DANA	Seriously, she's such a drag. And what is she wearing?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah, look, we grew up together and she just keeps following me around, but, just, shhhh.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Catherine, hi! You came,

CATHERINE	I did. 

CATHERINE	How is my favorite socialite?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Fabulous. We are celebrating.

CATHERINE	Oh, again. 

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Honey, we need to take you shopping.

CATHERINE	Oh, no, I have my own clothes, thanks.

DANA	If that's what you call those.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It will be my treat.

CATHERINE	What, did you get more money again?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, I got you a present.

CATHERINE	Isabelle.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ah, just open it.

CATHERINE	Wow!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Isn't it gorgeous?

CATHERINE	Yeah.

CATHERINE	Isabelle, did you spend twelvehundred dollars on this? That is too much!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Stop it, just put it on. 

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Honey, why do you look so tired?

CATHERINE	I had the craziest day at work, there's this guy and he keeps calling me

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Clay!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ugh!  Absolute rubbish!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hi Uncle Lyle.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Mm hmm, the benefit tomorrow, I remember.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Mm hmm, for the children's hospital right?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yup, I will be there you can count on me. Alright. Mm hmm.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ugh.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Chloe, I need a getaway.

CHLOE	Oh, when?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Right away. I am so bored.

CHLOE	Oh, I wish I could. I'm having some little, um, alterations done. Hey!

DANA	I totally wish I could Isabelle.

DANA	My dad's getting married.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Again?

DANA	Number five.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well that was quick.

DANA	I promised him I'd come to the wedding this time.

DANA	He says when I'm there for it the marriage lasts twice as long.

CATHERINE	Hey, Isabelle I can't talk right now I'm at work.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Not for long...

CATHERINE	What?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm going on a fabulous getaway.

CATHERINE	Okay?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Come with me.

CATHERINE	I can't. Maybe you didn't hear me. I’m working

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Come on that bug company can do without you for a couple of days.

CATHERINE	Are you purposefully ignoring me?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Come on we'll go some place that you want to go. Like, um

CATHERINE	Wow, I can tell you've given this so much thought.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Skiing, you love skiing. We'll go to Sweden, no Switzerland.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	They've got good skiing there right?

CATHERINE	Well yeah, but

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay! Pack your bags. We'll leave tomorrow, my treat.

CATHERINE	Isabelle, things are really busy right now. I can't just leave, can you ask...

CATHERINE	...can you ask one of your other friends?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No! I already tried that.

CATHERINE	Of course you did. Well,go by yourself.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I can't. Besides I need somebody to entertain me.

CATHERINE	Isabelle!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Besides, you owe me.

CATHERINE	Fine.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ha ha ha!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, it's perfect, right?

CATHERINE	Yeah, it's really nice.

CATHERINE	Hey, are we going to check in soon?

CATHERINE	Hello?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Let's go inside.

CATHERINE	Okay.

CATHERINE	Hey, um, I'm starving, Do you think they have a burger here?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Mm hmm.

CATHERINE	Isabelle?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I just don't understand. How could the presidential suite just not be available?

CATHERINE	I know. And it's not like this room is really pretty.

CATHERINE	You didn't even have a reservation.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Now you sound just like that angry little man downstairs.

CATHERINE	Sorry. Do you want to go swimming? I think I'm going to go.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'll meet you there.

CATHERINE	Hey are you going out?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hi, umm yeah, we're just going to go to dinner.

CATHERINE	Oh, well I'm hungry.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And cold too. Didn't you bring anything warmer sweetheart?

CATHERINE	Heh heh... Umm.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I mean I guess you could come with us.

CATHERINE	Gee, thanks, but I think I'll just get room service.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay, bye.

CATHERINE	Hey wait! Don't stay out too late because we have skiing in the morning.

CATHERINE	Brrr, I hope they have a hot tub.

CATHERINE	Hey Isabelle.

CATHERINE	Isabelle? Are you up? You ready?

CATHERINE	Of course you're still asleep.

CATHERINE	Isabelle... Wakey wakey.

CATHERINE	Wake up Isabelle. Wake up!

CATHERINE	Isabelle, your credit card got declined!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What?

CATHERINE	Woo, hoo! Come on, isn't this fun?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Catherine!

CATHERINE	Come one, we're already going real slow.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know the snow will still be here if we go later.

CATHERINE	Oh my gosh. It was quite a drive out here, if you didn't notice from the taxi fare.

CATHERINE	Besides, as much fun as it was sitting around waiting for you to wake up,

CATHERINE	I'd rather not waste the time.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well, can you just wait?

CATHERINE	Yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I think, I think my skis are broken. He gave me broken skis.

CATHERINE	No your skis are fine.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	This isn't even skiing.

CATHERINE	Yes it is. It's crosscountry skiing. It totally counts.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But you're not even that good at it.

CATHERINE	But I like it. Besides it's really great exercise.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah, but I pictured slopes, and harmless flirting as we wait for the ski lift.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And drinking hot beverages and sitting in the hot tub. Not this!

CATHERINE	You don't really ski, do you?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I do too! I know how, thankyou!

CATHERINE	You say you go skiing all the time.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, I say I go to ski resorts all the time. It's very different.

CATHERINE	Ok well, listen, it's actually really fun. You just have to give it a chance.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm sure.

CATHERINE	Makeup? Really?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Look, always look your best. It is the one rule I live by.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Just... you do your thing and I will do mine. Alright?

CATHERINE	Ok... Are you ready?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ohh ahhh!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, don't laugh.

CATHERINE	I'm sorry. Here...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, this is so stupid! You are stupid!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I am having you shipped back to America as soon as we get back

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	and I get something hot to drink. Ow!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	This is it! I've had enough!

CATHERINE	Yeah, well, you promised me skiing, so...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	On slopes!

CATHERINE	Well, you never specified that. And besides, this is what I wanted to do.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's all about what you want isn't it? You are so spoiled!

CATHERINE	Yeah, I get that all the time from you of all people.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know what? You're making me regret ever inviting you along.

CATHERINE	More like guilt tripping me into coming.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Whatever! You get to freeload on a dream vacation, boohoo.

CATHERINE	Isabelle, I am not one of your groupies or freeloading friends.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well, I'm paying for this and I say

CATHERINE	No, no I am tired of you holding the money over my head.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I don't do that.

CATHERINE	Yes, you do!

CATHERINE	It was your uncle's idea to help my mom when she was sick and that was so great.

CATHERINE	But you... anytime you can you like to take credit for it.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You're being ridiculous!

CATHERINE	No! What is ridiculous is you using that to get me to do whatever you want

CATHERINE	like come on this stupid trip.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I don't even understand what you're complaining about.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I mean you should feel lucky to even have me around.

CATHERINE	You are so full of yourself

CATHERINE	You actually think that the whole world revolves around you.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Apparently not the whole world.

CATHERINE	You know what? I'm just going to go ahead.

CATHERINE	You can catch a cab back to the hotel, ok princess?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Fine, be that way!

CATHERINE	Fine!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know what? When you're done with your whole

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	crosscountry thing you may as well pack your bags and go back to your

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	stupid bug job because I'm uninviting you, missy!

CATHERINE	Oh, well, see you at home.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Don't hold your breath.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Now that you're gone I may extend my vacation and actually have some fun!

CATHERINE	Well that is what you do best, Isabelle.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, oh, oh, ahhh!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Catherine? Are you still out here?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I can't believe she abandoned me.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ow.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's okay.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	[ DIALING ]  Oh, come on...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I hate Switzerland!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ow!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	This is all her fault. I'll have her deported

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Can't feel fingers...  can't feel toes.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But I can feel my ankle! Every step.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Someone help me...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Please! Someone help me!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	[ KNOCKING ]  Hello? I need some help!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hello? I just need to use your phone.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Please just...  Hello?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hello?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I need to... Can you let me in?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm hurt.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I got lost...  Just need to use the phone.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ahhhh!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hey!

HENRY WILCOX	Did she go to the fund raiser?

HENRY WILCOX	I got word that she used the company plane to go to Switzerland.

HENRY WILCOX	You have the authority to cut her off. There's the clause in the trust that gives you

HENRY WILCOX	the option to hold back what she's to receive when she turns thirty.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I can't hurt her.

HENRY WILCOX	Of course not. But you can do what's best for her.

HENRY WILCOX	Even if she doesn't like it.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I appreciate your guidance.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	Well good, that should clear up  the issue.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	But I am tired of these surprises that keep coming at the end of the quarter.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	So let's get it right.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	 Yes.

HENRY WILCOX	How did he react? Not the way I did.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	She has him wrapped around her finger.

HENRY WILCOX	I know he loves her, I understand that.

HENRY WILCOX	But there's a line and she crossed it years ago.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	Well, give it two weeks. She'll be in hot water again.

HENRY WILCOX	Maybe he'll listen then.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hey!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You awake yet?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hello?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Get away from me!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You're in my house.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Back away!  I live here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Are you dangerous?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	If I say no are you going to believe me?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No. My head hurts.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's because you hit it.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You attacked me!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No, but I could have. You broke into my home.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I knocked.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	And then you broke in.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	The door was open.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	That doesn't make it an invitation.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Listen to me... I need some food and something to drink.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And some pain killers would be nice.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I'm not your waiter.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I know, but you'll have to do.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	That's it. Get out!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I can't, I'm hurt.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well that didn't stop you from getting here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I got lost! Not my problem.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm making it your problem. Now get me some food.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Chili? In a can?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Eat up.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Alright. Rested, fed, now go on your way.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	My ankle hurts, and it hurts when I breathe.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well sadly, not enough to keep you from talking.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It hurts when I breathe! Call an ambulance!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Uh, no.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Fine. A cab, whatever...

JEREMY EDMUNDS	There's no phone here. No internet either.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Alright, then you'll just have to drive me to the hospital.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Where's your car?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I walked!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	From where?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	If I knew that, I would have gone there and not come here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Just get your keys.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't have a car.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Look... I am rich, alright, so whatever it takes,

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	just get me back to civilization.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	There is no car here!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Why?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't need one.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What, so you're just isolated up here?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I was until you got here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Wait, there's really no phone, car, a snowmobile?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Nope.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Then how am I supposed to get back to my hotel?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	There is nothing within twentyfive miles of here.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No bus stops either.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	The only way down is to walk.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	That doesn't make any sense!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	How do you live? I mean there must be a way down.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I have someone who brings me what I need once a month.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Great. And when do they come next?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Two and a half weeks. The only way down in the meantime is on foot.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Fine. Then this will just have to do.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Whoa, no, no this will not do.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You can't expect me to walk anywhere like this.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't expect anything except for you to leave.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well I'm in no condition to do that so that's out of the question.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Sure you are. Just stand up, hope over there

JEREMY EDMUNDS	until you're on the other side of the door.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm not limping my way back to civilization. Thankyou.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't care where you go, but you're not going to stay here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You wouldn't just throw me out in the cold?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Because, I'm tired, cold, I need a bath...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Which one's my room?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Don't you have anything else?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You mean women's clothes?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Uh, yeah.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Not in my closet.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You want me to take a look at that ankle?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Are you a doctor?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Sit down.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What is that thing?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Don't touch it.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Fine.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What are all these?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	They're mine. Leave it alone.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What's your name?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Jeremy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm Isabelle Elliott in case you were wondering.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Alright, this is probably going to hurt.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It does!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah, sprained.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh really?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Bad enough that there's going to be some bruising.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You have to ice it and stay off it for the next few days.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It hurts.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's normal. Hang on

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Where are you going?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	To get a bandage.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I'm going to wrap it, but loose enough you can still have some movement.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Easy! I thought you just said I was not meant to move it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well you want some give for motion, it's going to hurt a little bit more

JEREMY EDMUNDS	but heal with less complications that way. You don't want it to heal too tight

JEREMY EDMUNDS	or it's going to hurt more when you walk around on it later.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What's wrong with your side?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I hit it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Where? Ribs?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I don't know.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well you said it hurt earlier, when you were breathing.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Where?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	There!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ahh, yeah, right there.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You've probably got a cracked or bruised rib.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	There's nothing you can do about, just take it easy and let it heal.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	How do you know that anyway?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I just do.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What's with all this flannel anyway?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Is this mountain man thing your permanent look?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	My clothes are none of your business.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You should really have some standards.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	And you're welcome.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hope that's better than chili!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So weird.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Cleans up nice if he wants to.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yawn.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Doctor Jeremy Andrew Edmunds

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Jerk.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Do you mind? Some of us are actually trying to sleep!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Would you rather freeze?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So much for good manners. I'm a guest, remember?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Guests are expected.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Just, shhh!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Wow...

LYLE ELLIOTT	Come in Henry.

HENRY WILCOX	What are you doing?

LYLE ELLIOTT	You should have met my sister.

HENRY WILCOX	She's beautiful.

LYLE ELLIOTT	She was quite a bit younger than me.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Adorable, until she turned five and then she was a little firecracker.

HENRY WILCOX	Is that where Isabelle gets it from?

LYLE ELLIOTT	Maybe.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Laura was fierce in standing up for people.

LYLE ELLIOTT	And animals too.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I can't count how many strays she brought home.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I suppose that's how my parents felt about her husband.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Just another stray, not good enough for her.

LYLE ELLIOTT	So they thought.

HENRY WILCOX	You disagreed?

LYLE ELLIOTT	Oh, I stayed out of it. I could have been supportive.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I had little interest in marriage or family of my own.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Then they died and there I as with little Isabelle to watch over.

HENRY WILCOX	What was she like as a child?

LYLE ELLIOTT	Precocious, always thinking.

LYLE ELLIOTT	She'd smile sweetly to win you over and that was it.

HENRY WILCOX	Not much has changed then.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Oh, I wasn't well suited for the role. She'd...

LYLE ELLIOTT	Well I doted on her.

LYLE ELLIOTT	How could I not?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What are you doing?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Building a birdhouse.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What are you, fourteen?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's a hobby.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What are you doing out here anyway?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What do you mean?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well you're obviously not from here

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What gave me away?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And what's with the no phone, no internet, no anything?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's a bit boring don't you think?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's quiet. I like it that way.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's too quiet.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So what about you?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm a city girl.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	In fact if you had any contact with the outside world you may even recognize me.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Let me guess...an actress.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	A celebrity of sorts.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Great.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm rich.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Congratulations.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I've always been rich. It suits me.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know, you still didn't answer my question.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	That's right.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Fine.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Here's your plate.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ew. What is that?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Meatloaf. Let me guess...vegetarian.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No but I've got taste buds.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	That is horrible. I don't know how you could eat that.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Did your parents forget to teach you any manners after they gave you the golden pony?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yes, because they died.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Alright, that's it... Ground rules. You're going to stay here you're going to follow them. Got it?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh no, am I in trouble?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You're in charge of lunch. You want anything else to eat you eat what I'm making or you fend for yourself.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Next, try to be helpful. Whining all day doesn't count.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Just try not to be so difficult.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm not.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Alright. Wake up princess! You are the epitome of rudeness.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You're the most selfcentered person I've ever known.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You've been here for almost two days and you've done nothing but whine and complain.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't think a thankyou has ever once crossed your mind.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Alright, I am completely bored...  Oh. Sorry.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What do you want?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well, I didn't mean to interrupt, but...  I'm bored and I'm going crazy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Do you have anything to do?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Do you play chess?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know it's your turn, right?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I know.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, you'll be happy to know I've decided to forgive you for earlier.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Really?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What? Wait, ok we'll just play. Please... just...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So, do you play chess very often?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's a two person game.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Right. I just thought you might be one of those genius types.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know, that plays against themselves.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I'm not that smart.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Good point.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Check.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Why didn't you just sacrifice your queen?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I would never do that.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Why not?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Too important.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Check.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You understand you're losing because of it, right?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I told you, I'm not that smart.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	This is true... check mate.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	We could play a simpler game. You could go hide and I could count to ten.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What are you making?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Macaroni and cheese.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Really? Aim to impress don't you?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Fine.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	How about some dessert, mountain man?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Lunch is ready.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	There.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Wow. This looks good.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What did you put on here?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Just some paprika. I've seen it used before. It adds flavor.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	This?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yes.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Cayenne pepper.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, it's not... Well I didn't know. I

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You know I'm a guy right? I mean do you think

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I'm going to have paprika just lying around?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Great.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's really not that bad.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay, well I made a cake too.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Really? Um hmm.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Great!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Prepare to be impressed.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's good.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Really? Good.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, it's horrible. Yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You swallowed that.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I didn't want to be rude.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I followed the recipe... I don't understand.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Are your sure?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I know how to read a recipe.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	How much salt did you put in?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Just a bit.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	And this?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Sugar? A cup and a half I think.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	This is salt. That's the sugar.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I grabbed The wrong one.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	See this is exactly why I don't cook.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Ever? No, never.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Great! Now I ruined your shirt. Not that it's a great loss.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It'll wash out.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Do you have another shirt that I can borrow please?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What is it?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You said you didn't have any of this stuff.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I said I didn't have any in my closet.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Cheeky! Who's is it?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	My exwife's.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I'd rather her stuff get dirty than mine.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Thankyou.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You been icing that ankle?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	By the way, thankyou so much for the clothes.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It feels so good to be in women's clothes again.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Besides the paparazzi may show up at any moment and I would love to be ready.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm practically famous.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So, um, how long have you been divorced?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Three years.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And are you okay with it?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So is that why you moved up here?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah this was our getaway. After the divorce I made it permanent.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's so lonely though.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Don't you miss home, or being around people?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's what I wanted and needed.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Time to think. Time to

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Pray?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. So?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's just not my thing. It's fine if it's yours. I just

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Thanks for the permission.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I just don't get it. You know?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You didn't grow up very religious did you?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Not really. So

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It works for me.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Somebody to talk to. Someone to help.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's interesting.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You should try it sometime.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Why? I have pretty much everything that I want.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What more is God going to give me?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	There are some things money can't buy.

DANA	I don't know if this dress works for me. Is it to blah?

CHLOE	It depends on your shoes. Oh, hi Catherine.

CATHERINE	Hey guys. Um, how's it going? Where's Isabelle?

CHLOE	I don't know. She was going out of town.

CATHERINE	I know, I just, I thought that maybe she would be...

CATHERINE	You know what, never mind.

DANA 	Some hot but completely poor guy probably caught her attention.

CHLOE	She's so gullible. She doesn't even realize Clay only went out with her for her money.

CATHERINE	Ok, well, if you could just let me know when you see her

CATHERINE	That would be great.

ISABELLE ELLIOT	Um, there's some hot water on the stove if you want some.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Been there long?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Just now. That alright?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Did you make all these birdhouses?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Do the birds actually use them?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Free food helps.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So many little details. It's an interesting hobby.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I had a lot of time on my hands when I first moved here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well what do you do with them all?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I have a guy in town who sells them for me.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You really need to lose the flannel.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It keeps me warm.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So do layers.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	My clothes, my choice.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Alright.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Do you have any pain killers?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. Ankle acting up or is it the ribs?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	A little of both.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	How bad is it?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Better than before.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You mind if I take a look?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Did you rewrap this?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's too tight.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	The swelling's gone down so... that's good.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Have you had many sprained ankles?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You sure sound like you have.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I have a medical background.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Like a doctor? Certainly don't flaunt it do you?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No, gotta keep it quiet otherwise all the neighbors

JEREMY EDMUNDS	will come around any time they have any sort of ache.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Right. So, do you practice around here at all?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	How come?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I just don't.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well you're too young to be retired.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What sort of a doctor were you?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Doesn't matter.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Were you a cosmetic surgeon?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No. Don't get your hopes up.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You can't blame me for asking. But you should tell me because I

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hey, I have an idea. In the interest of eating well tonight, how about I cook?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Does that mean you don't want any more of my salty cake?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No. But you can help.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, daring

HENRY WILCOX	Melinda. What?

HENRY WILCOX	I want you to draft an agreement about Isabelle.

HENRY WILCOX	Specifically her being unfit to receive the chunk of the trust when she turns thirty.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	It has to have Lyle's signature it needs to be unanimous.

HENRY WILCOX	I think it will be.

HENRY WILCOX	Find out where she is, what she's doing.

HENRY WILCOX	It's been a little to quite and that never bodes well.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	She'll throw a fit about this.

HENRY WILCOX	I know. But it's worth it if it means she'll change.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It looks so good.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Just put a little powdered sugar on top. And we're done!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yay. Oh you have... on your face. Here.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Alright.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So what's that thing called anyway?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't know how to pronounce it. It's some soufflé.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's good. It's really good!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well thankyou.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So, I was wondering

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	About?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Home... for you.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	New York. Despite the accent.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	My dad was from London and my uncle sent me to schools out in England.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I think he wanted me to keep a connection with family.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You never picked up the American accent?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I can if I want to.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It just never seemed very natural to me. You know?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Is your uncle still around?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh yes.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Won't he be missing you?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I hadn't actually thought about that.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I mean, not that I'd count on a search party finding you in the Alps, but

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, I don't even think he knows I'm in the country.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Does anybody?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yes, a friend. But I'm pretty sure she's not looking for me either.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I was in a bit of a huff with her when we last parted.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	She probably thinks I'm out here having fun without her.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What did you guys fight about?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, you know, me being me.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	We're actually a really odd pair?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	How's that?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well, during summers, I would spend them with my uncle at his house.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And the other kids just...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It was like I had the plague. They had no idea how to talk to me.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But Catherine was nice. She listened, she told me what she thought when she thought it.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	She never beat around the bush. So we just always stayed friends.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	We're really different.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	How so?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	She's working class and I'm rich. Remember?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah, but, you're more than right?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well I'd like to think so. You know it's a wonder that we're friends at all.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	The way we treat each other... She's really sarcastic.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And I think she thinks I don't know but...

JEREMY EDMUNDS	But you're rich, not stupid.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Exactly. Yes, well put.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So how do you treat her?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Good. Really well when you consider all of the money I, my uncle, gave her mom.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Her mom?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	She got ill and they had loads of bills. She says I hold that over her head but

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Do you?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Really, I treat her really well because sometimes I buy her little gifts and things.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah, but that probably doesn't matter much to her, does it?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, probably not.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But you know, that's probably why I consider her a friend. Like, a good friend.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	A true friend?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Then you should tell her that.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	When you said you were a doctor did you really mean therapist?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Shoot!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Jeremy, I do hope you understand why one day. I forgive you.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Don't let this or the malpractice eat at you forever. Carrie.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Isabelle?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Um... Yeah?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hey.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, my goodness.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You have not got a stitch of flannel on you. It's gone.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I have to do laundry.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, it looks so much better.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Alright, don't make a big deal about it. What are you doing?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Um... I was just sitting and writing a letter.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	How are you going to send that?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Pigeon... carrier pigeon. Do the pigeons come to your birdhouses to eat from

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Not at mine.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Right... Well never mind then. What are you doing?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I wanted to see if you want to play chess.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Don't you have like a game box thing?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Like video games?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yes.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No. 

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Why not?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well, for one, because I'm not fourteen.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Right... Chess it is then. Lucky me.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Jeremy Edmunds is hereby suspended from practicing medicine and stripped of his medical license.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So what do you do?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Do?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah, you know, for a job.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No need.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Did you go to college?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yes, three actually, but none of them suited me.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Three, huh?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well it's hard to study for a job that you know you'll never actually going to need.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Sounds rough.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But I'm also on the board of directors for a charitable foundation.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Nice. What foundation?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Um, the Elliott Foundation.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Your family's?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yes but that doesn't make it any less impressive.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Of course not.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know it's not like I don't do anything. I have a life.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Okay, so, what do you do on a normal day?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I get up, get ready, you know, meet friends for lunch, go shopping...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Sometimes we go to the spa.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And sometimes I do appearances for um, like parties or benefits you know, those sorts of things.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So, uh, socialite.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know I really don't care for that term particularly.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Change what you do then.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I would but... [DRYER BUZZES] What was that?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	That's the dryer.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You mind pulling the clothes out while I finish here?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah, okay, um... Okay.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh no!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What happened?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I was carrying that, and it's so heavy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And the hallway is really narrow, and I

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You broke it?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It can be fixed, right?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Not really!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well don't you have some of that wood glue?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You can't just...

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hey stay away from that alright? I don't want you to break anything else.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It was an accident I didn't mean to.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah, well your excuses aren't going to fix this.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Jeremy, It's just a birdhouse.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You know, I realize that this doesn't look like it's worth much to you,

JEREMY EDMUNDS	but it means a lot to me. You probably can't get that.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I do get it and don't talk to me like that.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Like what?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Like I'm too stupid or shallow to understand your whole thing.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well sorry princess, but the shoe fits.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know what? That's nothing compared to what you've ruined.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What's that supposed to mean?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I may have ruined a lousy birdhouse but you've ruined people's lives, doctor.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You don't know what you're talking about.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You wish. I found your secret, guilty stash.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	What were you doing going through my things?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Finding out what you were hiding.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Those are my things.You were snooping through my past.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I think that I have a right to know exactly who I'm staying with.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	A right? I could have buried you in the snow and nobody would have cared.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Is that what you said when you killed that girl? Nobody will even care?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Who are you to judge? You don't do anything! Your whole life revolves around shallow

JEREMY EDMUNDS	people and how much money you can spend. It's useless.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Your whole existence is pathetic.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	[ VOICES ] You are the epitome of rudeness.

CATHERINE	You are so full of yourself you actually think that the whole world revolves around you.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You are the most self centered person I have ever known.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You don't do anything, your whole existence is pathetic.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	God, if you're listening, I don't want to be this way anymore.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Isabelle? Isabelle?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's just a deer.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Isabelle?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hello?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Isabelle!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Jeremy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	My hands are still numb.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Here you go. Thanks.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Was there an animal out there? Like a wolf?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Are you sure?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	There's not a lot of wolves that come out this way.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Then why were you in such a hurry?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's freezing out there. It's only going to get colder.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So you weren't scared?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Not of a wolf.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm sorry.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's just... don't do that again, ok?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No. Jeremy, I'm...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm really sorry. About everything.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I was angry. I shouldn't have

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Nope, you were right.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You probably don't say that very often, do you?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Nope.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So I started getting these, um, really bad headaches.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't know if it was a reaction to something... the flu.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	They'd last for days.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So I got a prescription... pretty heavy painkillers.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	They worked well. Really well. But then I kept taking them.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I felt better with them. Bad without.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It got to a point where I couldn't get off them. I didn't want to.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	My wife noticed, and I got defensive. It became a wedge in our relationship.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Another one.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I ran out of pills and I had a surgery scheduled.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Fairly routine, but not without the risk.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	But I was a wreck without the pills.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So I found an old prescription laying around. Just something to take the edge off.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	But, um, just couldn't focus.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Never should have entered the operating room that day.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I thought I could handle it. The patient died on the table.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	From there I was sued for malpractice. I lost my license.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	My wife was just horrified with the whole thing.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Not that I blame her. She was dragged through a lot.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I moved here after the divorce.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Did you try and get some help?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Before the surgery I didn't think I needed it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	But after, yeah. Court ordered rehab.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	How was that?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Better than the alternative.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It took a while for me to listen.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Not just about the pills, but about what I did.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Talked a lot about forgiveness, and God.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Do you think God has forgiven you?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Rehab, of all places, helped my relationship with God.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	But yeah, after all this time I believe that God has forgiven me.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	But, I can't imagine anybody else has.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You mean, her family?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Her family, friends

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm sorry, that's a lot to carry.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. It's probably why rehab suggested taking up new hobbies.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	That's where you learned that.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. Something to take your mind off it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Better than the other hobbies they were suggesting.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	That was my first one.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I am so sorry I broke it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Don't worry about it. I overreacted.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm also sorry that I snooped

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Not quite the happy story you were looking for, huh?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I just should have respected your privacy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I just tend to do whatever I want. I've always done whatever I want.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I picked up on that pretty quickly.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You noticed?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So you mind if I ask about your parents?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It was a car accident and I was four.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	That must have been hard.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I think that's what everybody thought and so they basically gave me whatever I wanted.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So I just took the attention and the pity and used that to fill the void.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's no substitute for parents though.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I thought the money was. I mean that's all I had left of them.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	That sounds really heartless, doesn't it?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know sometimes I wonder what they would think of me know, if they were here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I mean, just because they're not, that's not an excuse. Is it?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Anyway

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. You want some help up the stairs?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh no, I've got it.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Jeremy, you know you're not that man any more, right?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. I'm still ashamed of him though.

CATHERINE	No, no, Mr. Ling actually the technicians sprayed for those too.

CATHERINE	Well it does take about fortyeight hours to see the results.

CATHERINE	Well I can have another technician out to your... Mr. Ling?

CATHERINE	Have an awesome day.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	[ VOICE MAIL ] Hello, it's Isabelle. Leave a message but I probably won't call you back.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Something smells so good.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	That's because I'm cooking.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Cheeky.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Come on down.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Alright, but on one condition. After dinner, I teach you how to play chess.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay... Why did you do that?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So I could kill that guy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Alright, what are your next couple moves?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't know, I'm not there yet.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well you're supposed to be thinking ahead like have it planned out.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Here let's start again.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Don't forget to read the ingredients this time.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I know what I'm doing.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Alright, try that out.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's much better.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Good.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Check.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Check.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You're doing better.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Check mate!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Um... That's not actually check mate, but good!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's good. It is?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah, really good.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I made it. Nice job.

SECRETARY	Mr. Elliott?

LYLE ELLIOTT	Yes.

SECRETARY	You have a phone call from Miss Isabelle's credit card company.

SECRETARY	Mr. Wilcox thought you should speak with him.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Put it through.  Hello.

HENRY WILCOX	What did they say?

LYLE ELLIOTT	You know exactly what they said.

HENRY WILCOX	I thought you should here it from them this time.

LYLE ELLIOTT	She's been there almost two weeks.

HENRY WILCOX	I tried calling her but

LYLE ELLIOTT	She won't return the call.

HENRY WILCOX	She's not going to change. And I think you agree that she needs to.

HENRY WILCOX	I had Melinda draw up an agreement.

LYLE ELLIOTT	You want to cut her off?

MELINDA CHARLESTON	Not completely. Just until she's ready to be responsible.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	You know if she receives that next portion as planned it will be gone in mere months.

HENRY WILCOX	You said yourself she's been indulged.  Her entire life has been that way.

HENRY WILCOX	It's time to intervene.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Isabelle? Yeah

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hey.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hey you.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So it's scheduled for the delivery guy to come tomorrow.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, right. Of course.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You're probably ready to get home.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Uh, yeah. You're probably excited to have your home back to yourself.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. Well I just thought you'd like to know.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Thanks.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hey.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hi. What are you up to?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Just catching up on some reading.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What is that?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	The bible.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	In Chinese?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You speak Chinese?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well, I can read it. I told you I had a lot of extra time when I moved here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Right. And birdhouses weren't enough for you.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. I learned the characters, but

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But you don't speak it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Or write it. It's harder than it looks.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, I believe you.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So I came to invite you to my own farewell party.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I made the guest list?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh yes. Barely though, it was close there for a while.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Wow.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I also thought about calling it the "Thanks for not letting me die

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	or be eaten by a bear outside in the cold party."

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I think I like the first one better.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah, that sounded more fun. Okay. So Yes?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah, yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay. So do you want to come down in like an hour.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Sure.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You want some help?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, I'm good.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You sure?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yup. I'll see you.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Wow! Did you make all this from scratch?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I turned the oven on.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I thought about making it from scratch but then I found most of it sitting in your freezer.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	All of this was in my

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Wow. You look, uh, nice.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Thankyou.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Am I the first one here?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	That was really good. Thankyou.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You're welcome.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Where are you going?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	To get dessert.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You made dessert?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You know, it's not a party unless you have dessert.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I agree.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	S'mores.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah. You know how to do this right?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	The girl from London is asking me about s'mores.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Ready?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. Thankyou.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You're going to burn it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You're critiquing my cooking?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, your s'more making. It's very different.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I like it crunchy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	That's burnt to a crisp. Okay.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Perfect. Cookies?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You don't have any Graham Crackers. Oh, yeah.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	For me?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It looks so messy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Is it good?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's good.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's a little messy. I'm sticking to chocolate.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I've been wondering... why did you let me stay in the end?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	When you broke in?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh you love to put it that way, don't you?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well as much as you ticked me off I'm not heartless.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So I'm lucky it was you then.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I mean, honestly, as impossible as I thought it was, I've actually felt really at home here.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	So, is that why you were so bossy?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Me? Bossy?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay, so what you call bossy I think was just some valid fashion advice.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I mean, we had to break you from all that flannel

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	and get rid of that whole Paul Bunyan thing you had going on.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I mean look how much better you look now. It's like night and day.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I guess I was just lost without you.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I'm glad you ended up here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Even though I drove you crazy most of the time?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah. It was worth it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You want me to stay here?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But my whole life is back in New York.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well, they haven't missed you yet.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But eventually they will.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And as much as I've loved being here with you I can't just stay forever.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah, you're right.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Jeremy...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm not like you. I can't just leave it all behind.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Do you really want to go back to that life?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Look, it's all I know. I have too much

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Too much. Is it always about money with you?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I never said anything about money. I have people who care about me.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Unlike you I can't just leave them behind and hide away up here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Why don't you just go back home?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I have nothing to go back to.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	That's not true. You could start over, start fresh. I'm sure everybody has moved on by now.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I doubt it. What if I run into the family or someone who remembers?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Even that would be better than being isolated up here with nothing but your past just hanging over you.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't expect you to understand because you don't face consequences.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I do too.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Really? Or do you just make excuses and throw money at a problem until it disappears?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well it's better than just running away with your tail between your legs.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Just wasting your life instead of giving yourself a chance to have one and actually being happy.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Who are we kidding?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You're going to go back to your socialite crowd, your rich lifestyle.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	You have everything you need.You'll forget about me.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I will.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It's late. The delivery guy gets here early.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Dietrich! Sauerkraut?

DIETRICH	Ya!

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't eat this stuff.

DIETRICH	Try it.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I didn't order it this time or the last five times.

DIETRICH	Well, keep it for emergency.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Great, so if I run out of everything else I'll have six jars of sauerkraut.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	We're just about done here.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Good.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Oh, did you want me to send these clothes back to you?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No. Keep them.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Isabelle...

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Goodbye.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Get out of here Dietrich.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Really I'm fine Uncle Lyle.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	No, my ankle doesn't even hurt anymore.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It was all just a big accident but I'm home now.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Alright... I'll come and see you tomorrow, alright?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay. Bye.

CATHERINE	No, no you are correct. In fact, I am making a note on your account as we speak.

CATHERINE	So, mm hmm... Okay. Thankyou so much for calling. You have a great day.

CATHERINE	Oh my gosh, you're back and you're safe.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm fine.

CATHERINE	Did you really get lost? I never should have left you.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Um, as I recall I'm the one who left you behind.

CATHERINE	Yeah and then you got lost. I just assumed you got back to the hotel okay.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Catherine, seriously, don't worry about a thing.

CATHERINE	But you're fine?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I was, um... well taken care of.

CATHERINE	Yeah?

CATHERINE	You know I can probably sneak away early if you want to tell me about it.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I have to go and see Uncle Lyle next.

CATHERINE	Oh, yeah yeah

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But I will call you later, alright?

CATHERINE	Okay, yeah sure.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	See you. Bye.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I would have riled up every agency there is to find you if I'd only known.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I should have told you where I was going.

LYLE ELLIOTT	When I didn't hear from you I assumed...  Well I didn't think it was anything serious.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's my own fault. I didn't expect you to think anything was wrong.

LYLE ELLIOTT	You could have been hurt, or worse.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I was lucky. Hello.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	Glad to see you've returned safely.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Thankyou.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Perhaps this isn't the right time for us to discuss this.

HENRY WILCOX	I think it is the right time. We've discussed this at length.

LYLE ELLIOTT	She just returned from a very traumatic ordeal.

HENRY WILCOX	It doesn't change anything.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Wait, what's going on?

HENRY WILCOX	Per the provisions in your parents trust we are revoking you're next inheritance installment.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	What provisions?

MELINDA CHARLESTON	If the three trustees unanimously agree we can delay the payout until such a time as we deem appropriate.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	And we have agreed.

HENRY WILCOX	Isabelle, your outlandish spending, combined with your unacceptable public behavior...

HENRY WILCOX	It's not what your parents would want.

LYLE ELLIOTT	We'll provide for your living expenses. It'll be a minimal amount but you'll be fine.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	And beyond that, perhaps you should find a better use of your time. Something more meaningful.

HENRY WILCOX	Look, this whole Switzerland thing...

HENRY WILCOX	It's demonstrated just how reckless you've become.

HENRY WILCOX	We feel that this is about your safety and protection as much as the preservation of your future.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Alright.

MELINDA CHARLESTON	Alright?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's fine.

LYLE ELLIOTT	The money was meant to provide for you Isabelle, but it won't keep you happy forever.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I know.

DANA	Eleven carats

CHLOE	And she's not going to give it back?

DANA	No! She thinks she can keep it.

CHLOE	But he called off the engagement. Probably to get that giant rock back.

CHLOE	She's not worth eleven carats.

DANA	Oh poor Dan though. Right Isabelle?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah.

CHLOE	He should sue her.

DANA	I heard that he might on grounds of an affair.

CHLOE	She didn't!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hey... are you busy tonight?

CATHERINE	Your uncle really cut you off?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yup. But I don't blame him.

CATHERINE	You are unusually calm about this.

CATHERINE	No seriously you are starting to freak me out. What happened to you over there?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I realized I have everything that money can buy.

CATHERINE	Yeah?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So isn't it a little odd that I don't have everything I want?

CATHERINE	What more could you want?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	To be happy. I mean, when I got there it drove me crazy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	But then it was so peaceful and calm and quiet. I actually really liked it.

CATHERINE	The quiet? Or the quiet with a good looking guy?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Did I say he was good looking?

CATHERINE	You just did.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah he is.

CATHERINE	So give me the rundown on this guy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I was horrible to him and he told me so. And it made me feel disappointed.

CATHERINE	How?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	In myself. You know? Like for the first time, maybe ever,

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	it actually bothered me that I had hurt someone else.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I've been pretty terrible to you too.

CATHERINE	Not terrible...

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Terrible. I held money over your head just like you said.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	And basically guilted you into doing whatever I wanted you to do.

CATHERINE	Why?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Because I wanted you around. Because... maybe I didn't want to lose the one real friend that I had.

CATHERINE	And you thought the money thing was the way to do it?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yes I did.

CATHERINE	Isabelle, I am friends with you in spite of the money.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Really?

CATHERINE	Yeah. Wow, this guy really got through to you.

CATHERINE	Do you miss him?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah.

CATHERINE	You should try and see him.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm pretty sure he'd rather just forget all about me. He asked me to stay, but

CATHERINE	You said no.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yup.

CATHERINE	And now you've changed your mind?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well I only said I didn't want o stay there. It didn't mean I didn't want to be with him at all.

CATHERINE	Isabelle, I have seen you chase loser guys all the time.

CATHERINE	This one's better than that and you really like him.

CATHERINE	So isn't he worth fighting for?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I don't know what to do God.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I know what I want, but, I can't forgive myself for what I did.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	How can anybody else?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Help me... Help me be strong

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Help me not be afraid.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Help me to forgive myself that I might be happy again.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Hi Isabelle,

LYLE ELLIOTT	Just calling about an event we're having tomorrow for the foundation.

LYLE ELLIOTT	You can call me and I can give you more details about it.

LYLE ELLIOTT	You're doing good.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I feel a little out of my element.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Well that's a good thing every now and then.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	There you go.

CHILDREN	Thankyou. Thankyou.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	He's just a kid.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Yes

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I think it was easier when I just thought of them as a faceless bunch.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Opens your eyes doesn't it?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I'm glad you could come.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Me too. You know, I've actually been thinking, if it's alright with you,

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'd like to be a little bit more involved in the foundation.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I don't know how much help I'd be.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I know I don't know very much, but I'd kind of like to try.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Of course.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah?

LYLE ELLIOTT	Are you happy Isabelle?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm trying to be.

LYLE ELLIOTT	I only ask because you've been different since you came back.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Isn't that good thing? I mean

LYLE ELLIOTT	Somewhat yes. But I still need to know that you're happy. I mean truly happy.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Me too.

LYLE ELLIOTT	What happened out there?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I met someone and he was nice.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Just nice?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I think maybe I think about him a little too much.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Well that could mean something.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Not really. We're too far apart.

LYLE ELLIOTT	You don't have to be.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	It's not like I can pick up the phone and call him. He is in the middle of nowhere.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Go see him. I'll call and have the plane ready.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Uncle Lyle Go!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I'm not even sure he would want to see me.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Well you won't know until you do see him.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Thankyou.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Excuse me?

DIETRICH	Oh, guten Tag!

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hello, I'm looking for Jeremy.

DIETRICH	Ya. He's gone.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Gone?

DIETRICH	He asked me to watch the cabin.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Gone where?

DIETRICH	To America, I think.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Why?

DIETRICH	I don't know. He left this morning.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Okay, thankyou.

CATHERINE	Hey what happened?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	He's not here.

CATHERINE	What, are you serious?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Apparently he's on his way back to the US.

CATHERINE	To find you.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I don't know. I mean, I'd like to think so but he could be going anywhere.

CATHERINE	So, um, what are you going to do?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well I'm on my way back now but I don't want to miss him.

CATHERINE	Yeah, how soon can you get back?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Not soon enough. Look, I know that you're at work,

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	but is there anyway that you could just go to my place just in case he shows up?

CATHERINE	Yeah, I can totally do that.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Thankyou.

SECRETARY	Mr. Elliott?

LYLE ELLIOTT	Go ahead.

SECRETARY	You have a visitor here, a Jeremy Edmunds. He says he's here about Isabelle.

LYLE ELLIOTT	Send him in.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hello Mr. Elliott. I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.

LYLE ELLIOTT	How do you know Isabelle.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	She stayed at my home for a little while. I'm sorry, I don't know if she told you about her trip to Switzerland

LYLE ELLIOTT	You're the man she met.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah... Do you know where I could find her?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Catherine!

CATHERINE	Hey. He isn't here.

CATHERINE	But maybe... he could have gotten here before I could get here but then

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Why wouldn't he be back by now.

CATHERINE	Well maybe he was delayed, he was on a commercial flight right?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Probably.

CATHERINE	Then he's on his way.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Maybe I'm not the reason he was coming out here at all.

CATHERINE	Well, what other reason would there be?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I don't know. I can think of a few.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Maybe he never forgave me for the way I left, the things that I said.

CATHERINE	No, Isabelle, you're being too hard on yourself.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You've never said that to me before.

CATHERINE	Well, it was never true until today.

CATHERINE	Listen, go get some rest some rest you've got to be tired. And besides, you've jumped a million time zones.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Hi.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Hi.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You're here.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I mean, he said you were coming, but

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Who?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Your delivery guy.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Dietrich? You spoke to him?

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah, um... I went to find you.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Well I came here.

CATHERINE	Wow, I'm really tired, I've got to go.

CATHERINE	I've been babysitting this apartment all day

CATHERINE	and there's no food in the house because Isabelle can't cook.

CATHERINE	So, I'm just going to go get some takeout probably, on my way home.

CATHERINE	Sorry... but you guys have great night though.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Listen I'm sorry. I... I was cruel and selfish.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	I've always been cruel and selfish.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	You are the first person to make me want to be something else, and

JEREMY EDMUNDS	No, I was being selfish. I was asking you to leave everything behind but I wasn't willing to do the same.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Maybe it doesn't even matter any more.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	It does... because you desere somebody with a future and for me to have a chance at that,

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I've got to be willing to let go of the past.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	So does that mean you want me in your future?

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Yeah! But, it's not going to be easy.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	But if God could forgive me I should be able to forgive myself.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	Living in hiding really isn't living at all.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Well neither is living without the person that you love.

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I'm so glad I found you.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Wait! Are you sure that you're ready for me? I mean, I'm kind of

JEREMY EDMUNDS	I've survived so far.

ISABELLE ELLIOTT	Yeah? Okay.
