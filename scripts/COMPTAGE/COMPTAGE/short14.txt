THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...Not sulking. 

THOMAS	Everyone knows that James likes to be the centre of attention. 

THOMAS	One day he was so busy showing off he didn't do his job properly. And his passengers complained.

THOMAS	The Fat Controller was angry with James and gave him the job of pulling rubbish trucks. 

THOMAS	But James wanted to pull passenger carriages not rubbish trucks so he began to sulk. We all thought James' sulky face was funny so we started to pull funny faces too! <laughs> 

THOMAS	James realised that sulking hadn't helped and that he couldn't always do what he wanted. It was more important to be Really Useful. 

THOMAS	James had changed his attitude. And even though he was pulling freight, he began to enjoy himself!

THOMAS	And that's why even if you have to do something you don't want to do, you shouldn't sulk!
