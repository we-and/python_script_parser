STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the Island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends: Really Useful around the World!
STORYTELLER	Thomas goes to New Zealand.

STORYTELLER	Thomas was in the City of Wellington picking up some passengers.

STORYTELLER	But not just any passengers – the Sodor Rugby Team!

STORYTELLER	“Hello!” said the Captain of the Team, “You look just like a good old Tank Engine from back home!”

STORYTELLER	“That’s because I am a good old Tank Engine from back home!”...and then looks a little uncertain.

STORYTELLER	Although he wasn’t too sure about the “old” part.

STORYTELLER	“Hey!” shouted the Rugby Captain to his Team Mates. “He’s one of us!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas thought it was funny – to make friends with people from Sodor – all the way on the other side of the World!

STORYTELLER	The Team Captain took a ride in Thomas’s cab. He told him that the Sodor Rugby Team were visiting Auckland – to play a friendly game against the team there.

STORYTELLER	There was a lot to see on the way. It was all pretty spectacular – and new to Thomas...

STORYTELLER	...but the Team Captain had visited New Zealand before...

STORYTELLER	...and so he knew what to expect!

STORYTELLER	“What scary faces!”

STORYTELLER	“Don’t worry,” said the Team Captain, “Maori tribesmen always greet visitors with displays of scary faces - just to see how brave they are!”

STORYTELLER	“And if you think that’s scary, wait ‘til we meet the New Zealand Team!” 

STORYTELLER	Thomas was worried. He thought the Sodor Rugby Team were here to play a “friendly” game...

STORYTELLER	...but the Auckland Rugby Team didn’t look very friendly at all!

STORYTELLER	Then Thomas remembered what the Captain had told him about greeting visitors with scary faces – “to see how brave they are.”

STORYTELLER	Thomas decided he would join in!

STORYTELLER	“Welcome to New Zealand!” said the Captain of the Auckland Rugby Team. “You’re going to fit right in here!”
