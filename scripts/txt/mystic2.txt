ISSIE	I’m coming home. I’m not staying in this hell hole any longer.

ISSIE	Are there horses in the forest?

NATASHA	No. There are horses at the stables.

ANISHA	Ok, so you’re seeing ghost horses now.

ISSIE	That’s the horse. He’s the one I saw yesterday. It was running away from someone.

ADAM	Oi.

ISSIE	There was a man. He was chasing me. I think he drugged her.

TOM	I’ll call my vet. 

AMANDA	Come in, it’s cold.

ISSIE	Yeah, I’ll be in, in a minute. So no-one else can see you?

SAM	Ah, Julia. Sam. Yeah, I still haven’t received details of the expansion plans. I can’t be across this if I don’t know what’s going on. Anyway, could you get back to me please? Okay. Yeah, thanks, bye.

NATASHA	Finally. Can we please go to the stables now?

SAM	Yes, yes, yes. I’m sorry for keeping you waiting all of  seconds there.

NATASHA	What?

SAM 	I can’t be across this if I don’t know what’s going on.

IC	He doesn’t know yet?

JULIA	He doesn’t need to know.

ISSIE	Check it out. Two plane tickets for Thursday afternoon. We land in the UK first thing Friday.

ANISHA	Your mum is gonna have a fit. I can’t believe you didn’t ask her first.

ISSIE	I don’t care. We always do the wild swim on Dad’s birthday. I’m not missing it just because she dragged us halfway across the world.

ANISHA	Well yeah, I hear you babe, but, are you ok?

ISSIE	What do you mean?

ANISHA	Well, like after yesterday, I mean, it all seemed pretty hardcore and, like, you’re seeing ghost horses and stuff.

ISSIE	I’m tired, I guess. But, I’m definitely coming home.

ANISHA	Well, good luck telling your mum.

MITCH	Is Issie up yet? I haven’t seen her this morning.

AMANDA	Yep, she was up at dawn. I found her outside, just staring at the sea. She seemed pretty spaced out.

MITCH	Well, wouldn’t you be after getting entangled with a horse rustler.

MITCH	Issie love. Did you have a bad night?

ISSIE	No, I mean. I.

ISSIE	So, listen mum, about Dad’s birthday this weekend.

AMANDA	We will do something special, I promise.

ISSIE	Yes, but it won’t be the same here, will it? Doing the wild swim in Cornwall was his thing, that’s the whole point.

AMANDA	I know, and I’m sorry, it’s just too far to travel.

ISSIE	So, we’re not gonna celebrate his birthday anymore? Is that it? Shall we just, pretend like he never existed?

AMANDA	Did I say that?

ISSIE	Whatever. I knew you’d be like this, so…

SAM	Hello? Anyone in?

AMANDA	Hey.

SAM	Morning. I brought Issie’s bike back. You left your stuff in the car the other day. I went ahead and changed the tyre.

ISSIE	Thanks, I completely forgot.

AMANDA	Oh, that’s very thoughtful of you.

SAM	Oh, no. No worries.

MITCH	Can I help you Sam?

AMANDA	Sam very kindly brought Issie’s bike back.

MITCH	Did he now? I wanted a word with you anyway.

SAM	Oh. Good.

MITCH	Your little friends are building right by my hives.

SAM	Sorry?

MITCH	That shiny new Hexronn expansion is messing with my bees and they’ve stopped producing.

SAM	Mitch.

MITCH	You’ve sold out to a bunch of environmental bandits.

AMANDA	Mum.

SAM	Look, sorry, I don’t know anything about your bees. But Hexronn is an eco-friendly company. I guarantee it Mitch.

AMANDA	I am, I’m so sorry about all of this. Would you like to come in for a cup of tea?

ISSIE	Oh right. I guess I’ll go then.

AMANDA	Issie.

AMANDA	Would you believe me if I said I don’t know either of these two people?

ISSIE	What’s wrong with her?

TOM	Keep your distance. What are you doing back here?

ISSIE	I wanted to see her before I… never mind, how is she?

TOM	She’s kicked off her bandage and I can see the wound’s infected, but she won’t let me clean it.

ISSIE	What about the horse rustler? Did they manage to find him?

TOM	No. Not yet.

ISSIE	But they can’t just let him get away with it.

TOM	Yeah well, that’s life I’m afraid.

ISSIE	Brilliant. Did you find out who she belongs to?

TOM	Woah, woah. Woah, woah. Yeah, I made some calls, but nothing yet. She doesn’t seem to be chipped either, which doesn’t help. Easy girl, easy girl. Ssh. Ssh.

ISSIE	No.

ISSIE	It’s ok.

TOM	Issie.

ISSIE	It’s ok, nobody’s gonna hurt you. There’s nothing to be frightened of.

ISSIE	I like the stripe on her head.

TOM	It’s called a blaze.

ISSIE	Blaze. That’s what her name should be.

TOM	That wound’s getting worse. I need to call the vet.

CALEB	You two have the most dysfunctional relationship.

DAN	Alright, next time remember, straight horse, straight line. Keep your eye on the paddle at all times.

ISSIE	Hey.

CAROLINE	Oh, Issy. I can’t believe we missed all the action yesterday.

STELLA	Yeah, are you ok?

DAN	Amazing that you saved that horse.

ISSIE	Yeah, Tom says he needs to call the vet though.

DAN	Look, Tom will do everything he can, he knows his stuff.

CAROLINE	Yeah, he used to be a professional event rider.

DAN	He’s a bit of a horse whisperer.

ISSIE	A horse whisperer?

CAROLINE	You know, like when you speak to them in a secret language.

CALEB	It’s not a secret language, it’s just, using body language to communicate with the horse, and gain trust.

DAN	So if anyone can help that horse, it’s Tom.

ISSIE	Hey, Tom did you speak to the vet?

TOM	Yeah. She confirmed what I thought. It’s cellulitis.

DAN	Cellulitis. Oh man.

ISSIE	What’s that?

TOM	It’s a very serious infection.

ISSIE	But can’t you give her something? Like antibiotics?

TOM	She’s too volatile, she won’t let it heal. And if that infection gets too strong, well then.

ISSIE	What?

TOM	Well the kindest thing would be to put her down.

ISSIE	No. No. You can’t.

TOM	The vets gonna come out first thing Thursday morning to see if there’s any improvement, but.

DAN	Anyway I can help?

TOM	Yeah, well it’s pretty tough getting these painkillers into her, you could help, it would be good practice.

ISSIE	Practice?

DAN	Yeah, I’m training to be a vet.

ISSIE	Oh, great, then you can kill horses too.

TOM	Come on Dan.

ISSIE	Tom. You’re not really gonna let her die are you?

TOM	Look, I’ll do what I can. But I’ve got eleven other horses I’ve gotta look after.

ISSIE	But there’s nothing wrong with them. Blaze needs you.

TOM	What do you expect me to do?

ISSIE	What about horse whispering?

TOM	What about horse whispering?

ISSIE	They all said you’re an expert.

DAN	It was mostly the others.

ISSIE	If you can get Blaze to calm down, then we can treat her.

TOM	It’s not that simple. I can’t put all my resources in to one horse, I’ve got a business to run.

ISSIE	So it’s just about money for you is it? What makes you any better that the horse rustler?

ANISHA	Hey Is. Have you started packing yet? Babe, I can’t wait to see you. Ring me back when you can. Yeah.

AMANDA	Oh. Why has this gone all tiny now?

MITCH	What are you doing?

AMANDA	My CV. For some reason it’s got seven different fonts.

MITCH	Looks like you’ve sat on the keyboard. Let me have a go.

AMANDA	No, you know less than I do. Oh, cancel the search party, my missing daughter has returned. Where have you been all day?

ISSIE	I went to see that horse we found yesterday.

AMANDA	What?

ISSIE	Just to check on her. Don’t have a meltdown.

AMANDA	No I’m not, I’m just, pleased you’ve made friends, with a horse. Why don’t I come down and meet it?

ISSIE	Really?

AMANDA	Yeah, tomorrow morning.

ISSIE	Oh, mum I need to talk to you about something.

AMANDA	Do you know, I can’t tomorrow morning, ‘cause I’ve got a, I’ve got to do this…

MITCH	What?

AMANDA	What?

MITCH	What have you got tomorrow morning?

AMANDA	Nothing, nothing, none of your business. Stop looking at me.

MITCH	Oh yeah, I see.

AMANDA	What? What do you see?

MITCH	You know he’s sold himself to the devil?

ISSIE	Wait, what are we talking about?

AMANDA	He’s just going to show me round a bit.

MITCH	Sam. Your mother’s fancy footing with him.

ISSIE	What? Are you kidding?

AMANDA	I’m just…

MITCH	Do you have any idea what Hexronn’s gonna do to this town?

ISSIE	How serious is it?

AMANDA	What do you mean?

ISSIE	Your date.

AMANDA	It’s not a date.

ISSIE	Wow. I can see why you don’t want to go home.

AMANDA	Issie.

ISSIE	You can’t wait to move on from dad.

AMANDA	You don’t know what you’re talking about.

ISSIE	Ok. Prove it.

AMANDA	What’s this? Ah, please tell me this is a joke.

ISSIE	If I left it to you, we’d never go.

AMANDA	Issie. How much did you spend on these tickets?

ISSIE	Who cares? It’s my money and it’s Dad’s birthday. The plane leaves Thursday afternoon, you have all of tomorrow to pack.

AMANDA	This has got to be one of the stupidest things you have ever done. I’ll have to see if I can get a refund.

ISSIE	Why?

AMANDA	Because it’s ridiculous.

ISSIE	Fine. Forget it. You might have turned your back on dad, but I never will.

MITCH	Listen love.

AMANDA	Look, it’s fine. It’s fine.

MITCH	Now, let me sort this out for you. How hard can it be? Ok. Mitch taps on the keyboard.

MITCH	Uh oh.

MITCH	Sorry love, I’m just looking for my glove.

ISSIE	What? What’re you?

MITCH	I need to move the hives before those Hexronn vampires trample them into oblivion.

MITCH	Aha. You ok love? The day’s cracking on.

ISSIE	Yeah, I had a bad night.

MITCH	Oh. Anything I can help with?

ISSIE	I’ve been having these really weird dreams lately.

MITCH	You tell me, I love a bit of dream interpretation.

ISSIE	Ok. Well. I was in the woods.

MITCH	Oh see, that’s travel. Well that makes sense.

ISSIE	And there were these horses, running, they were scared. It was horrible.

MITCH	Horses. Need to check my dream guide. Oh, it’s in the attic. Come on.

MITCH	You’ll find some treasures up here.

ISSIE	Wow, this is a lot of stuff.

MITCH	Well, you never know when something’s gonna come in handy. Now, where’s that dream guide? Oh this is even better.

ISSIE	What is it?

MITCH	It’s a dream catcher. I brought it back from New Mexico. You hang it above your bed, and it catches all your worst nightmares.

ISSIE	Problem solved.

MITCH	Ok, now what else have we got in here?

AMANDA	Hey.

SAM	How you going?

AMANDA	Good. And you?

SAM	Yeah, very nice thanks.

DAN	Back again, London? You sure you’re not into horses?

ISSIE	I came to see if Tom changed his mind.

ISSIE	I don’t actually think you’re a horse killer by the way. Just in case you were wondering.

DAN	You sure say the nicest things.

ISSIE	Yeah well don’t get used to it.

DAN	Come on then, Tom’s this way.

DAN	Tom.

TOM	Ah. Alright. Here. You can get rid of the rocks and you can make sure the fence is secure.

ISSIE	What makes you think I’m gonna do your manual labour for you?

TOM	Do you want me to help Blaze, or not?

ISSIE	What? You mean you’ll try horse whispering?

TOM	I ain’t promising any miracles, it’s been ages since I’ve done this.

DAN	Can you teach me how to do it to?

TOM	No. You’re both gonna have to keep your distance. Now you make sure the ground is smooth and you make sure the fence is steady. I’ll be back with Blaze.

SAM	…three meals a day and it’s just toast.

AMANDA	Oh, thanks, for this morning and showing me around and…

SAM	It’s good to get the lay of the land.

AMANDA	Yes, and it’s important, I know where to get a top-quality fishing rod. Yeah, everyone’s been really friendly.

SAM	Well, we don’t get that many new faces around here. Especially pretty ones.

AMANDA	Oh.

MIRIAMA	What can I get you two?

AMANDA	I, ah, a coffee.

SAM	You don’t want something to eat?

AMANDA	Oh. I didn’t know we were eating.

MIRIAMA	Two coffees it is.

AMANDA	A big one please. Mum’s coffee is terrible, she’s got this ancient machine and she will not get rid of it.

SAM	I guess it’s not easy, moving back with your mum.

AMANDA	No, I mean I should have known. We spoke every couple of weeks when I was in the UK and still managed to wind each other up.

SAM	Only every couple of weeks?

AMANDA	Why. How often do you speak to your mum?

SAM	Well not as often now that she’s…

AMANDA	So she’s not haranguing you all the time.

SAM	No.

AMANDA	Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

SAM	She died. Last year.

AMANDA	Oh right, oh God, I am, I’m so sorry.

AMANDA	Gosh, this, yeah. I’ve just remembered, I said I’d pop into the stables to see Issie, she’s got a, a horse. I should go.

SAM	Really? Now? I can give you a lift.

AMANDA	No, No, No, I’ll walk, so, it’s left out of here.

SAM	Come on, come on, I’m going that way anyway. Coffee’s to go please Miri.

ISSIE	What are you trying to do?

DAN	Tom has to get her to run around him, so she can see him properly.

ISSIE	You’re scaring her.

TOM	Keep it down.

DAN	The horses see different to us. They’ve got their eyes on the side of their head. But Blaze isn’t behaving like she should, she’s trying to fight him rather than learn.

ISSIE	I should be in there with you.

TOM	No.

ISSIE	She trusts me.

TOM	You’ve never even ridden a horse before. I’m in charge here. Come on.

NATASHA	Dad? What are you doing here? With Issie’s Mum?

SAM	I was. I was just giving Amanda a lift.

AMANDA	Yeah. Is Issie about?

TOM	Back, back, go on, back.

CALEB	How’d you get Tom to do this?

CAROLINE	We’ve never seen him horse whisper before. Like ever.

TOM	Back. Go on.

DAN	London here, basically shouted him into submission.

ISSIE	Shut up.

DAN	See.

TOM	Yeah. Ooh.

ISSIE	What’s he doing now?

DAN	Trying to get her to trust him. She’s thinking about it.

ISSIE	Hey, what’s he doing?

TOM	Alright. We’re done here.

ISSIE	What?

TOM	It’s not gonna work with this horse. Sorry. I can’t heal her if I can’t get through to her.

ISSIE	But you can’t just give up on her.

TOM	No Issie. Whatever’s happened to her, runs too deep.

ISSIE	Well, let me try.

TOM	No.

CALEB	Issie.

TOM	Issie.

ISSIE	Blaze. No.

AMANDA	Issie.

ISSIE	Ah, my foot.

AMANDA	Issie.

TOM	Woah, woah.

AMANDA	Issie. Are you ok? Are you hurt? Can you move it? Is it broken?

ISSIE	Mum stop, I’m fine.

AMANDA	What do you think you’re doing? Putting my daughter in danger.

TOM	It’s not my fault she’s out of control.

SAM	So’s that horse. You’re not keeping it here are ya?

ISSIE	No, no, we can still tame her.

TOM	No. The vet’s coming in the morning. There’s nothing more we can do.

AMANDA	Issie.

MITCH	Seems ok to me.

ISSIE	Yeah, it’s fine.

MITCH	It’s just bruised. I’ll get you something.

ISSIE	Thanks.

AMANDA	I think you were right. About your dad’s birthday.

ISSIE	What?

AMANDA	We should go. It’s our tradition.

ISSIE	Look, I thought you said.

AMANDA	Yeah I know I did, and I was gonna cancel those plane tickets, but I’ve changed my mind.

MITCH	Amanda think about this, you’re not really gonna travel eleven thousand miles just for a swim?

AMANDA	It’s not just a swim though, is it? What time do we need to check in?

ISSIE	About midday tomorrow.

AMANDA	Ooh. We’ll have to leave first thing.

ISSIE	Yeah, there’s just something I have to, I mean we’d have to leave…

AMANDA	No, it’s ok. You were right. It’s important to be there. Well go pack your things. Go on.

ISSIE	Thanks.

MITCH	What’s gotten into you all of a sudden?

AMANDA	I don’t know mum. I came here to start again, to get over, but leaving everything behind just feels, terrifying.

MITCH	What do you mean? Did something happen? Amanda?

AMANDA	No. Fine, I was fine, it’s just today, I suddenly felt, just winded, just panicked at the thought of moving on.

MITCH	This is about your tour with Sam.

AMANDA	No, well maybe a bit, but, he’s, it’s not his fault. It’s just it’s been three years and I thought I was fine, and I am fine, it’s just Ed’s birthday’s coming up and I just, I feel like a traitor. What, so I just sit around having coffee with people?

MITCH	You’re not a traitor. You’ve got every right to live your life, Ed would want you to. Flying all the way back to England, is that really gonna make you feel better?

AMANDA	Well, I’ve promised Issie now. Anyway, thought you’d be pleased to have us out of your hair, be nice and quiet again. Won’t it? Eh?

ISSIE	I don’t know what to do. The vet’s gonna put Blaze down just as I leave for the airport.

ANISHA	I mean, maybe that’s a good thing? You wouldn’t wanna watch that would you?

ISSIE	I can’t leave her.

ANISHA	Okay, look on the bright side, you can come see me after your swim.

ISSIE	That’s the bright side is it?

ANISHA	Well yeah, we can go to Mia’s party, we’ll have a great time, I promise you and let’s be real. You’re not really a horsey person aren’t you? Like what could you have really done with Blaze?

ISSIE	Hey.

ISSIE	I’m not giving up on you, OK?

ISSIE	You’re here again. What do you want from me?

ISSIE	Come on.

TOM	Issie. What are you doing?

ISSIE	Look Tom, she’s doing it.

TOM	Ok Issie, nice and calm. Good, good, good. Now wait, if she drops her head.

TOM	Send her round again.

AMANDA	I can’t find her anywhere, we’re supposed to leave for the airport in an hour.

MITCH	Her bike’s not outside.

AMANDA	Where could she have got to? Oh, I think I know.

DAN	Issie.

TOM	Quiet. Don’t distract her.

ISSIE	Other way Blaze. Come on.

CALEB	She’s slowing down.

TOM	Alright, see if she’s ready.

ISSIE	That’s it.

STELLA	How did she do that?

TOM	She made Blaze feel safe.

CORRINE	Oh, cool.

ISSIE	Alright, come on Blaze. We need to get that wound sorted.

ISSIE	Good girl.

ISSIE	There you go. You’re safe. Don’t worry.

TOM	That was a very reckless stunt you just pulled. I can’t argue with the results.

AMANDA	Issie. Issie, what are you doing here? We’re supposed to be catching a plane.

ISSIE	Yeah, yeah, ok, just hang on one sec, yeah.

AMANDA	Oh yeah, no problem, I’m sure our international flight will wait for us.

ISSIE	Look, you have to cancel the vet. Blaze can be managed, you can help her.

TOM	It’s not that easy. You’re the one with the connection.

ISSIE	I know.

TOM	And she’ll take a lot of care and attention, more than Dan and I can give. If you want to help, it’s gonna be a lot of mahi. A lot of work. Every day. And I can see that you’ve got somewhere else to be.

ISSIE	Mum.

AMANDA	I know. You do what’s right for you.

ISSIE	What about the flights? I spent all of that money.

AMANDA	Well luckily for you, money bags, they’re flexi tickets, so we can just post-pone the trip for a bit.

ISSIE	Sorry for messing you about.

AMANDA	It’s alright. And we can discuss your insane approach to health and safety later.

TOM	Oh, right oh, look forward to that one.

ISSIE	Well. Looks like I’m staying. And so is she.

MITCH	Here you are. I’ve had a clear out, so you’ve got your own room.

ISSIE	Really? Oh, I love it, cheers Gran.

AMANDA	And this is what you call a clear out?

MITCH	Yes, I’ve thrown out bags and bags of stuff, I know where everything is now. There’s still some work to do, but make yourself at home, what’s mine is yours.

ISSIE	Cool.

AMANDA	Oh look, you kept my old French horn.

MITCH	Yeah, yeah that was a difficult summer.

AMANDA	Issie. Issie.

ISSIE	Hmm.

AMANDA	I am sorry about your dad’s swim.

ISSIE	That’s ok.

MITCH	You know girls. It’s not just England that has sub-zero temperatures to freeze your cockles off in.
