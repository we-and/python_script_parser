(My First Christmas)


 
ANGELICA	I’m 17, and I’ve never been in love. I've never had someone hold me as if I would unravel if they let me go. I don't know what passion means. I don't know what it feels like to have someone caress my face and touch my lips. I wonder what a real kiss tastes like. A lot of people would say not to worry about it, I’m still young, and they’d be right - the only problem is - I’m dying.

DOMENIC	Merry Christmas.

GLENDA	Do you know how to play- 

CHARLIE	No.

GLENDA	But you don’t know what song I was going to say.

CHARLIE	Don’t do requests, but Merry Christmas anyway.

GLENDA	Oh come on, you have to know Silent night. Jingle bells?
	
CHARLIE	Look this is the only song I’m going to play.	


SEAN	Wow, (referring to the tips). Just from playing that?

CHARLIE	A cello.

SEAN	A money machine if you ask me.

CHARLIE	An honest wage.

SEAN	Whatever. So, what do you plan on doing with all that anyway?

SANDY	Merry Christmas.

CHARLIE	(to Sandy) Uh huh. None of your business.

SEAN	Just asking.
	
CHARLIE	I got work to do, so do you need something or you just going to bug me all day?

SEAN	I thought I’d bug you all day. Hey! Where ya going?

HEIDI	I’m sorry, I don’t have any money.

SEAN	Oh c’mon lady, can’t you see it’s an honest wage?

CHARLIE	What do you think you’re doing?

SEAN	Just trying to get you more money.
	
CHARLIE	Yeah, well you’re scaring everybody away. Why don’t you just go find something more constructive to do.

ANGELICA	Not much, sorry.

SEAN	A quarter?
	
ANGELICA	It’s all I have. Well, Merry Christmas. Are you okay?

SEAN	Hey, the girl’s talking to you, snap to.

HEIDI 	Jell, let’s go!

ANGELICA	Bye.

SEAN	Hey what’s wrong with you, man? Do you know her or what?

CHARLIE	Reminds me of someone.

SEAN	Where ya going?

CHARLIE	I’m done here.

SEAN	Well, can I borrow some money?

CHARLIE	No. Supposed to drop below zero.

SEAN	Little big. It’s perfect. (a beat) But about that money -

CHARLIE	What about that wallet you stole?

SEAN	What? You’re seeing things.

CHARLIE	One day you’re gonna get caught, then what?

SEAN	What do you care?
	
CHARLIE	Yeah, well don’t ask me for money anymore. Besides, you already stole my quarter.

SEAN	It’s just a quarter! (a beat) Whatever. What are you doing?
 
YOUNG GIRL’S VOICE	(in phone) Hello? Hello? Sean, is that you?

SEAN	You’re going to arrested, how’s that going to help her?

YOUNG GIRL’S VOICE	Sean?

SEAN	Why do you even try? Shut up!

NURSE DIANNA	I’m sorry honey. You okay? That vein of yours is a little rascal. There ya go.

MARK	Where’s Vivian? She usually does this.
 
NURSE DIANNA	She’s on vacation. Lucky her. But I’ll take good care of you, hun.

ANGELICA 	I like Vivian, my regular nurse, she never missed. I have a rare type of cancer called myelodysplastic syndrome, which causes my bone marrow to produce bad blood cells, the result is catastrophic really. I hope she gets better at this.

HEIDI	Comfortable? 

ANGELICA	Thanks.

HEIDI	I got double shifts today, but I’ll check in during my lunch break. Okay?

ANGELICA	I got dad, don’t worry.

MARK	Lucky you. (to Heidi) You’re going be late.

HEIDI	Okay okay. (to Angelica) I love you.

ANGELICA	Love you too, mom.

MARK	What is this?
	
HEIDI	This company is producing some new medicine, sounds hopeful. Read it. (she kisses him) Call me if anything comes up.

MARK	Yeah, yea I will.	 You okay, honey?

ANGELICA	I get so tired of hearing that. Of course I’m not okay, look at me. Yeah, I’m fine.

MARK	If you need anything I’m right here.

ANGELICA	What’s wrong?

MARK	Nothing’s wrong, everything’s fine.

ANGELICA 	He always says that, I don’t know why I even ask. I’m pretty sure that “nothing’s wrong” is code for “everything’s wrong, but you’re too sick to worry about that, so we’ll just pretend for now.” I don’t think that there’s such a thing as nothing. I think ‘nothing’ is impossible. I hate this place. It’s always so	 cold, especially the drugs running through my veins -I hate how it makes me shiver. I	 hate the fevers, the needles, the smells - I hate what it did to my hair. Oh no, I’m really not in the mood for happy.

BRANDON	Whoa, not yet.

NURSE TARYN	I’ve never seen anyone so exited to sit in one of those chairs.

BRANDON	Yeah, he’s a weirdo.

TOMMY	Hey! Between you and me, I don’t think it’s the chair.
	
BRANDON	You good?

TOMMY	I heard that, you know.

BRANDON	Whatever, so you got everything?

TOMMY	Yeah, don’t worry I got everything.

BRANDON	Okay, okay. Just checking. You know I want to stay with you, right?

TOMMY	I know you have school and work. Don’t worry I have friends here.

BRANDON	Look, it’s not always going to be like this. I’m gonna get a better job, we gonna get a bigger place	 and I’m gonna be around a lot more, you know that right?
	
TOMMY	Yeah, I know. We go through this	 every time you drop me off.

BRANDON	...Right, okay let’s get you situated then. (to Taryn) So, we’re all good?

NURSE TARYN	(grimacing) Not exactly.	
 
BRANDON	Oooh- one sec.	 Go find your girlfriend. I’ll join you in a flash, okay?

TOMMY	She’s not my girlfriend.

BRANDON	Yeah, whatever. (fetches his wallet) I know I’m behind, but I can put something down today, okay?	

TOMMY 	Hi Mr. Jacob!

MARK	Oh, hey Tommy. How ya feeling today?

TOMMY	Good, real good.

MARK	I’m glad to hear that. Where’s your brother?

TOMMY	Paying the nurse.

MARK	(to himself) Yeah, I know that feeling. Excuse me, Tommy.
 
TOMMY	Hey Jelly - Hey are you asleep? Hello? Hey Jelly are you sleeping? Jelly? Hey, It’s me ...Hello?

ANGELICA	Sheesh! Don’t call me that, and I was no thanks to you!

TOMMY	But that’s your name.

ANGELICA	It’s Angelica.

TOMMY	Why does everyone call you Jelly then?

ANGELICA	Everyone doesn’t, only my parents.

TOMMY	Why?

ANGELICA	You’re annoying. I’m sorry. I’m just tired. Okay?

TOMMY	It’s okay, so you wanna see what I got? 
 
ANGELICA	Sure.

TOMMY	But, I won’t start reading until you’re ready.

ANGELICA	Okay I don’t know why I’m so mean to him. I didn’t used to be such a grouch.

NURSE DIANNA	Hi Tommy, it’s nice to see you again.

TOMMY	Not really.

NURSE DIANNA	Well, you know what I mean. Let’s see what we have here.

TOMMY	Ow.

NURSE DIANNA	I’m sorry. Did that hurt?

TOMMY	No.

NURSE DIANNA	I’ll adjust it for you, okay?

ANGELICA 	I wish I could be more like him, not afraid.

SEAN	Whoa.

MARK	What are you doing???!!!

SEAN	Dude, you almost ran over me.

MARK	“Dude” you were sitting in the middle of the road!

SEAN	Hope you have insurance.

MARK	What?

SEAN	You almost killed me. I mean I could have some mental injuries, nightmares, loss of sleep, I might even lose my job, so that’s gonna cost you.

MARK	Your job? You look homeless to me.

SEAN	Yeah, lucky you. Sorry. I’m dizzy from almost getting hit. Do I know you? Do I want to know you?

MARK	Get away from there!

SEAN	Okay, okay...geez. Another time.

MARK	You okay? Are you okay, hun?

ANGELICA	I’m sorry.

MARK	It’s okay. Just lie down, don’t worry about it. We’ll be home soon.

ANGELICA	The many wonderful side effects of chemo. Yummy.

JAZMINE 	Dear Sean, in case you didn’t get my last letter - I wanted you to know that I told everyone what Mr. Johnson did to us -And everyone believes me, So you should come home now. My new foster parents are nice, you would like them. I know you called, but you’re afraid to talk, that’s okay. School is good and I have friends, but I don’t have my brother and that’s what I want the most. -Bye for now. I love you lots. Your little sister, Jazmine.

TOMMY	I win I win!

ANGELICA	Whatever.

TOMMY	Don’t be a sore loser.

ANGELICA	I’m not, I didn’t want to play in the first place, but you’re such a pain in the butt.

MARK	(warning tone) Jell...

TOMMY	Do you have a boyfriend?

ANGELICA	What? Why?

MARK	Okay, you know what? I’m going to grab something from the cafeteria, you guys want anything?

ANGELICA	Actually, can you get me a soda?

MARK	What? No, you might as well asked	 me for a glass of poison.

ANGELICA	Don’t exaggerate.

MARK	How about a nice clean distilled bottle of water, mmmm.	

ANGELICA	Fine, and a ding-dong.

MARK	You’re a ding-dong.

ANGELICA	YOU’RE a ding dong!

TOMMY	So, do you?

ANGELICA	Do I what?

TOMMY	Have a boyfriend?

ANGELICA	Oh, well it’s complicated.

FATHER LAWRENCE	Hey, how ya doing? It’s been cold lately. How are you making out? (a beat) Don’t talk much huh? (a beat) Well if you need anything, anything at all you just let me know. (a beat) Are you hearing anything I’m saying?

SEAN	How about you just let me eat.

FATHER LAWRENCE	Ah, you do talk. Do you have a name?

SEAN	I didn’t know that was required to get a warm meal?

FATHER LAWRENCE	It isn’t. But we’re just not free food. We’re a service that’s trying to get people like you back on their feet. You know it’s hard to help someone when they keep running. How old are you?

SEAN	I’m not running.

FATHER LAWRENCE	Well, how come every time I try to approach you, you run.

SEAN	Nothing’s free, huh Father?

OFFICER DANIEL	Hey!What are you doing?
	
SEAN	Nothing.	

OFFICER DANIEL	Look, you’re going to have to clean this up. Did you hear me? Hey, GET BACK HERE!

TOMMY	It’s okay if you don’t have a boyfriend, cause I don’t have a girlfriend either.

ANGELICA	I told you it’s complicated. I don’t think you’d understand. Unbelievable. I can’t differentiate fantasy from reality anymore. Oh well, it’s not like I’ll ever see him again anyway. What can it hurt to pretend?

TOMMY	What’s his name?

ANGELICA	Un-believable.

TOMMY	What?

ANGELICA	What are you doing?

SEAN	Shh.

TOMMY	Hey, who’s that?

SEAN	Please, please. I’ll explain later, I promise.

ANGELICA	He’s my friend. Okay? Play sick. 

TOMMY	I am sick.
 
ANGELICA	Well then, just be yourself. He’s gone.

TOMMY	Hey, why are the police after you?

SEAN	Cause they’re dumb. (to Angelica) Thanks, I totally owe you.

TOMMY	What did you do?

SEAN	Nothing, They just don’t have better things to do. What’s your name?
 
TOMMY	Jelly.

ANGELICA	Angelica.

TOMMY	I thought you were friends?

SEAN	I like Jelly.

ANGELICA	Well that’s great, but it’s Angelica.

SEAN	Well “Angelica” thanks for saving me, I totally owe-

MARK 	Jelly?

SEAN	Oh oh. I gotta go.	

MARK	Who was that?

TOMMY	A criminal.

ANGELICA	No he’s not. He’s a friend from school. Just visiting.

MARK	You know my wallet’s missing, which is weird cause (he suddenly realizes something) I know where I’ve seen him.

TOMMY	COPS?



MARK	No no. He’s that homeless kid that we almost hit yesterday, remember?

ANGELICA	YOU almost hit and I told you he’s from my school. You’re just tired.

MARK	Are you sure?

ANGELICA	That you’re tired? Yeah.

HEIDI	Shower.
	
MARK	What?
	
HEIDI	You smell like work?
	
MARK	Yeah, well what do you expect me to smell like?
	
HEIDI	But it’s especially “work-like” this morning - go shower.	

MARK	But I’m so tired.

HEIDI	We’re all tired. Now go.

MARK	I lost my wallet.

HEIDI	What?

MARK	Or someone stole it.

HEIDI	Well, we’ll have to figure it out later, but right now you have to go shower, we have Jell’s last session today, remember?

MARK	Oh yeah, about that.

MARK	I got some overtime, which is great, right? I mean more money, so I have to go to work earlier than usual, which means I won’t be able to take Angelica to chemo today.

HEIDI	Oh honey, I can’t take off today, I’ll get fired. I can’t believe you did this.

MARK	Did what?

HEIDI	Nothing, just never mind.

MARK	Yeah, well, I’m sorry that I’m trying to keep this family from the streets!

HEIDI	Here’s my phone, you call me at the diner if you need anything at all, anything. Okay?

ANGELICA	I don’t need it. I’ll be fine, really.

 


HEIDI	Are you sure?

ANGELICA	Yes.


HEIDI	Okay, I’m so sorry honey, I wish I could stay all day, but-

ANGELICA	Go already, you’re going to be late.

HEIDI	Well, I arranged to take some long breaks and I can get an hour for lunch. I got the car today, so I’ll be here every chance I get, I promise. But if you need me for anything, I’ll drop whatever I’m doing and I’ll be here, I promise. In a second.

NURSE DIANNA	Okay, all set. I think...Nope, everything’s fine. You’re all set. You just yell if you need anything, okay?
 
HEIDI	You know what? Maybe I should just stay.

ANGELICA	Uh uh, you’ll lose your job. Just go, I’ll be fine, I promise. Besides, I got Tommy.

TOMMY	So, what’s your “friends” name?
	
ANGELICA	What’s that supposed to mean?

TOMMY	It means, I don’t think you really know him.
	
ANGELICA	What are you talking about?

TOMMY	Do you like him?
	
ANGELICA	Whatever.

TOMMY	Okay if you’re not going to talk about it, how about I read the book?

ANGELICA	I don’t know, I’m not sure I’m into a children’s book.

TOMMY	It’s not, I promise. Please?
	
ANGELICA	Okay.
 
TOMMY	Ready? “Dear Editor, I am eight years old. Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus –

ANGELICA	Wait! Not a children’s book? C’mon.

TOMMY	It’s not, just let me keep reading, geez.

ANGELICA	Fine. If it gets worse I’m burning it.

TOMMY	“Dear Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism, of a	 skeptical age. They do not believe except what they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds.”

ANGELICA	Wow, you’re right. Where did you get a book like that?

TOMMY	It’s my brothers.

ANGELICA	Your brother?

TOMMY	Yeah, I know it doesn’t look like it, but he’s smart, going to college to be a doctor. But don’t tell him I have it.

ANGELICA	Why?

TOMMY	Cause I’ll get in trouble.

ANGELICA	For having a book? Makes no sense.

TOMMY	My mom gave it to him and he’s still mad at her for leaving us, even though it was a long time ago. Anyway, he doesn’t want me to have any reminders.

ANGELICA	Oh, I’m sorry.

TOMMY	It’s okay. It’s always just been me and Brandon anyway. Can I keep reading? “All minds, Virginia, whether they be men’s or children’s are little in this great universe of ours-”

ANGELICA	I’m just gonna close my eyes, okay, but I’m still listening, I like it though.

TOMMY	“Man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the-”

ANGELICA 	I should have given him my number... yeah right...like he’ll ever call me...some sick bald girl...but still...the next time I see him, I will...Oh c’mon who am I kidding?...he’s homeless, how am I supposed to find him? Search the streets? Maybe my dad can almost hit him again.

SEAN	Hi. Yeah, I have that effect.

TOMMY	Where are the police?

SEAN	That’s funny.

ANGELICA	What are you doing here?

SEAN	Well, I figured I kind of owe you an explanation.

ANGELICA	You do? 
 
SEAN	Sure.

TOMMY	How come the police were after you?

SEAN	The police just like harassing me. I just have that kind of face.

ANGELICA	Yeah, and what a face.

SEAN	What? Do I have something on my face? Is your dad here? She shakes her head. Good. Can I sit?

TOMMY	You smell. 

SEAN	Really?

ANGELICA	Tommy!
 
SEAN	Do I?

ANGELICA	Maybe a little.

ANGELICA	Not that bad.

TOMMY	Can I keep reading?

ANGELICA	Well, we have company, it might be kind of rude.

SEAN	What is it? Good taste, I love that book. Read on little man.

TOMMY	“Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and -Devotion exists, and you know that they abound and give...”

ANGELICA	His medicine is pretty strong; works fast. You really know that book?

SEAN	No, does ANYBODY?

ANGELICA	Then why did you tell him that?

SEAN	I didn’t want him to feel like a freak show. So, are you ever going to unwrap that blanket from your head?

SEAN	Why?

ANGELICA	I don’t even know your name.

SEAN	Sean. You’re not contagious? Well, you can’t be too careful in a hospital. And you’re Jelly.

ANGELICA	Angelica. Don’t be smart. Is that a charm bracelet?

SEAN	Yeah.

ANGELICA	Why do you have a charm bracelet?

SEAN	I know it’s not very manly, but my sister made it for me.

ANGELICA	Oh, you have a sister, what’s her name?

SEAN	I don’t want to talk about it.

ANGELICA	I’m sorry.

SEAN	It’s okay, So, what’s your story?

ANGELICA	I have cancer.

SEAN	Yeah, I figured, but what’s the prognosis?

ANGELICA	Oh, well I’m dying.

SEAN	Wow, that’s dark.

ANGELICA	It’s just the truth.

SEAN	There’s no cure?

ANGELICA	Yeah.

SEAN	So...

ANGELICA	It’s complicated.

SEAN	How about him?

ANGELICA	Lymphoma cancer. It’s his second go around.

SEAN	Wow, a tough break. I remember you, you know.

ANGELICA	What do you mean?

SEAN	I’m sorry. I’m also an expert pick-pocket, although not proud of that, but it is what it is.	You remember me now?

ANGELICA	Uhm...oh yeah, now that I think about it - Anyway, thanks Although totally un-cool to take it in the first place, but I guess you redeemed yourself.

SEAN	So, what do you do for fun besides sit here all day?

ANGELICA	That’s about it.

SEAN	That sucks. Do you like music? I meant what kind?

ANGELICA	All kinds. Why are you a musician?

SEAN	Just making small talk.

ANGELICA	Not very good at it.

SEAN	Well, I’m just trying it out.

ANGELICA	Can I ask you something personal?

SEAN	Sure.

ANGELICA	Are you homeless?

SEAN	It’s complicated.

ANGELICA	Hmm.

SEAN	Let me see(Gesturing her head)

ANGELICA	Nuh uh.

SEAN	It’s not a big deal really.

ANGELICA	No.

SEAN	Well, you don’t need it anyway.

ANGELICA	What do you mean?

SEAN	You want me to get a mirror? You’re a hottie. I mean hair is lucky to have you, really, and your smile, it lights up this room- I mean look around. You’re the best thing in the place...Hey, you okay?

TOMMY	She’s reacting to the glivec. It’s too strong. Happened to me. Get the nurse. Hurry. Don’t be afraid Angelica, they just need to adjust the drip, okay? Don’t worry. I’ll read to you ‘til they come. “How dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias, or Angelicas.”

ANGELICA 	I’m scared, God, don’t let me die now, please. I don’t want to die, not like this. Please.
 

NURSE DIANNA	It’s okay honey. You hang in there. Just relax.

SEAN	Is there anything I can do?

NURSE DIANNA	Who are you?

TOMMY	Our friend.

NURSE DIANNA	Well, okay, but you should go. She’ll be okay.

SEAN	Yeah, okay.

ANGELICA 	I’m so embarrassed.

NURSE DIANNA	Okay honey, just breathe deeply. It won’t be long. You’ll be fine, don’t worry.	

HEIDI	Honey? Honey? How ya feeling?

ANGELICA	Hi mom.

HEIDI	Hi baby. I’m so sorry I wasn’t there. I knew I should have stayed. I knew it.

ANGELICA	No, it’s okay, you couldn’t have done anything anyway. It was just a reaction to the drip.

HEIDI	Well, I have the rest of the afternoon off, so I’ll be here with you all night, okay?

ANGELICA	‘kay. My body’s killing me. I love you mom, but please just go away.

HEIDI	Hey, your father’s wallet. He thought he lost it. Honey, what’s this?

ANGELICA	Huh?

HEIDI	This bracelet. That’s not yours, is it?

ANGELICA	I need to sleep.

HEIDI	Okay, I’ll be in the next room if you need anything.

SEAN	Hey. How come you’re not playing?

CHARLIE	Not in the mood.

SEAN	Man, you’re missing out on all the money.

CHARLIE	Do you want something or what?

SEAN	You’re drunk.

CHARLIE	HEY! HEY YOU, GIRL!

SEAN	Dude, what’s wrong with you?

CHARLIE	She looked like my Jenny.

SEAN	Who’s Jenny?

 
CHARLIE	What did you say???

SEAN	You said something about your Jenny.

CHARLIE	No I didn’t.

SEAN	You know, maybe with all that money you make you should go get a nice warm room with a hot shower and bed instead of that poison you’re drinking.

CHARLIE	We all got our crosses to bear.

SEAN	What’s that supposed to mean?

CHARLIE	It means I get what I deserve.

SEAN	You did something bad, huh Charlie?

CHARLIE	I gotta go.

SEAN	Hey, do you think I can borrow another quarter? A quarter would’ve been good.	

FOSTER MOTHER	What did you wish for?

JAZMINE	I can’t tell, or it won’t come true.

FOSTER MOTHER	You’re right, okay, let’s get eating.

FOSTER FATHER	Is that yours? Remember we let you keep that for emergencies. It’s not a toy.

JAZMINE	I’m sorry, I don’t have to get it.
 
FOSTER FATHER	Well, it’s your birthday. Go ahead.
	
JAZMINE	(in phone) Hello? (in phone) Hello? Sean, how come you never say anything. I know it’s you. It’s my birthday. I miss you and it’s almost Christmas. Come home. I mean I know you don’t have a home, but I bet Mr.and Mrs. Thompson would take you. They are the best foster parents so far. Please say something.

SEAN 	Don’t do it.

JAZMINE	Please.

SEAN	Happy Birthday.

JAZMINE	I knew it, I knew it was you! When are you coming? I miss you soooo much.

SEAN	I really miss you too, but I can’t come home. You know why right? Hang up the phone, idiot!

FOSTER FATHER 	Sean, if that’s you, you really need-

SEAN 	I TOLD you it was a bad idea. You don’t know what you’re talking about. They’re going to find you. I wasn’t on the phone long enough.	There’s hundreds of other ways, don’t be stupid. God, you’re an idiot. Now you got her in trouble	 too. What kind of brother are you? HUH??? SHUT UP. You don’t love her, you’re	 selfish. I said SHUT UP!!!	

FOSTER FATHER	He hung up. If he calls again, you need to tell us, okay?

JAZMINE	Is he in trouble?

FOSTER MOTHER	No honey, but he hurt someone and he just needs to come in and talk to someone about it.

JAZMINE	But it wasn’t his fault. That man was bad. He did stuff.

FOSTER FATHER	We know. You don’t have to talk about it anymore. That man has been punished, but your brother still needs to tell them what happened.	You just can’t go and push people down the stairs, he could have died, then your brother would have been in a lot of trouble, Okay? He just needs to tell the police what happened and I’m sure they will understand, but if he doesn’t then they’ll be looking for him and that’s not good. Right?
 
FOSTER MOTHER	Okay, now let’s have a party!

RYAN	Okay, let’s go! Oh c’mon, you gotta be kidding me. John!

BRANDON	Slow night.

MARY	Thank God.

BRANDON	What, you don’t like to work?

MARY	No, I mean it, Thank God. It means we’re not trying to fix dying people. It’s a blessing.

BRANDON	I hear ya. Do you mind?

MARY	Go at it, I can use a doctor friend.

BRANDON	Yeah, you might want to put an ad out, I got a little side tracked.

MARY	Having problems?

BRANDON	Trying not to go broke.
	
MARY	Medical bills, huh?

BRANDON	Yeah, it’s been tough.	

MARY	So, how’s he doing?	

BRANDON	He’s a strong kid.

MARY	Oh oh, that doesn’t look good. Another drunk.

BRANDON	I don’t think so.

MARY	Hey, where ya going?

BRANDON	Hey! Hey, you okay? Hey what happened? You’re hurt.

SEAN	No, I’m good.

JOHN	What are you doing?

MARK	Nothing. Break. Just taking a break.

JOHN	Well that’s great if it were break time. But see see how everyone’s working?

MARK	Yeah, sorry about that. I’ll get on it.

JOHN	This isn’t the first time.

MARK	Yeah. I know, it’s just, well you know I got a lot on my mind.

JOHN	I understand, really, but listen, I’m afraid I have to let you go. I’m sorry.

MARK	You’re firing me?

JOHN	I have no choice.	

MARK	Wait, please just give me another chance, I won’t screw it up. I promise.

JOHN	I can’t. It’s not my call.

MARK	John, I can’t lose my job. I can’t lose my insurance, you know about my little girl.

JOHN	Don’t do that to me. That’s not fair. Look, I’ll lose my job if you don’t lose yours. Do you understand what I’m saying? You’ve had other complaints that went way past me. It’s not my decision. I can’t do anything even if I wanted to.
 
MARK	Well at least let me finish out the night.

JOHN	I don’t know what tell you.

MARK	Look, anything. I can’t go home to Heidi tonight, not like this. Please.

JOHN	Alright, huh, why don’t you clean out the salt bins.

BRANDON	Can you hear me? What’s your name? What happened to your hand? Are you on anything?

SEAN	What happened?

MARY	That’s what we want to know.

BRANDON	That laceration on your hand is gonna hurt without any medication, and you lost a lot of blood. We’re	 going to have to take you to the hospital.

SEAN	No, no I can’t go there. Look, it  doesn’t even hurt.

MARY	Yeah, well wait until the pain killers wear off.
	
MARK	You don’t have a choice, we’re taking you to the hospital.

BRANDON	What’s your name? Do you have any id?

SEAN	Yeah, my wallet. I probably dropped it, outside by the trash cans. I can go get it.

BRANDON	I’ll take a look. I’m going to look for his wallet.

MARY	Make it fast.

SEAN	Over there!

MARY	Hey! Brandon, he’s taking off! Too late, we gotta go.

HEIDI	Morning.

MARK	You’re up early.

HEIDI	Couldn’t sleep. Recovering from the chemo is always hard on her.

MARK	I know.

HEIDI	You know she had a bad reaction yesterday. But nothing too serious.	It was that new medicine.	They were just giving it to her too fast. Are you listening to me?

MARK	Look at this.

HEIDI	Yeah, I know, but did you hear anything I said?

MARK	Of course I did. But look at this, and this and this, I mean how are we supposed to pay all these? And what’s this? Why is this so high?

HEIDI	It was the specialist that we saw, remember we already talked about this. Everything’s going to work out, okay? We just have to have a little faith.


MARK	Faith is not going to pay these. And still no word from the donor registry. You know what’s going to happen if they don’t find her a match.

HEIDI	You sound like you’re losing hope.

MARK	I’m just being realistic.

HEIDI	I know things are tough right now, but God has a plan.

MARK	God? C’mon Heidi. Open your eyes and look around you. Our daughter is dying and the chances of her finding the right donor is like winning the lottery and you know what? It’s our fault. You understand that don’t you? If she weren’t biracial, she’d actually have a chance. So, what kind of plan is that? And now I got a stack of bills on the kitchen that has no way of being paid. Do you know what it’s like dodging creditors every day? Do you know how that makes me feel?	I don’t know how long I can do this. I really don’t.

HEIDI	Hey, C’mon. You’re just having a bad day. WE will get through this, like we always do. We made a beautiful daughter, it’s not our fault that there’s not a match out there for her right now. It’s not like we knew this would be in issue. It’s nobody fault. And with the bills, you know the insurance company will cover most of them, the rest we’ll just get on some payment plan. They’ll work with us.

MARK	No, no they won’t.(a beat) Not anymore.

HEIDI	What? What are you saying?

MARK	Heidi - I lost my job.

HEIDI	What???

MARK	I got fired.

HEIDI	You got fired? I don’t understand. How could you let this happen???

MARK 	It’s not like I did this on purpose.

HEIDI 	Well you have to go back - go and get your job back.

MARK	You DO know what getting fired means, right?

HEIDI	Don’t be condescending.

MARK	I’m sorry, but you make it sound like this is my fault.

HEIDI	I don’t care. Just go get your job back, even if you have to get on your hands and knees.

MARK	I’ll have something lined up, don’t worry.

HEIDI	That’s great Mark, whatever that means. But until then we have no insurance.

ANGELICA	Dear God. I know you work in mysterious ways, at least that’s what I hear. But I pray that this time it’s not so mysterious. I think you probably already know, we’re not doing too well. I pray that dad gets a job and mom doesn’t worry so much. I pray that they never know how much it really hurts me and please let me be as brave as Tommy - I pray for him too. I pray that I find a match -And that I won’t ever have to do treatments again. But, and it’s a big but, if I don’t get better then I pray that I die fast since we just ran out of insurance. I hope that doesn’t sound too morbid, but I’m just being practical. Oh and there is one last matter at hand. Well, you probably already know, but in case you don’t, it’s involving Sean. I like him a lot, and I pray that he likes me too, and that I get to see him again, geez, is that too selfish? Anyway. Amen. A little to the right. Too much, now go left. whoa, whoa, not that much, go right...just a little.

MARK	I’m getting too old for this.

ANGELICA	No, you just need to start working out.

MARK	Did you really just say that to your father? C’mon, I need your help. Perfect. I’ll go get the decorations.

ANGELICA	Sorry. What are you doing here?

SEAN	I...I - hi.

ANGELICA	Yeah, hi, but what are you doing here?

SEAN	I’m sorry - I shouldn’t of come, huh?

ANGELICA	No, no. It’s great, I mean I’m glad you did.

MARK 	Jelly, do you know where the star is?

ANGELICA	What?

SEAN	I like “Jelly”...it’s cute.

ANGELICA	Cute?

SEAN	Look, are you going to invite me in or what?

ANGELICA	I can’t.

SEAN	Of course what am I thinking. 

ANGELICA	No, it’s not that. So, why are you here?

SEAN	I couldn’t find you at the hospital and I think I lost my bracelet, I thought maybe you knew where it was.

ANGELICA	You came to see me at the hospital? Well, how did you know where I lived?

SEAN	Drivers license. Your dad’s wallet, remember?

ANGELICA	Right. You really came all the way over here just for a bracelet?

SEAN	Well, it’s an important bracelet. You scared me. The last time I saw you I thought that you were going to die.

ANGELICA	Yeah, I’m embarrassed about that.

SEAN	Are you feeling better?

ANGELICA	Yeah, sometimes recovering from chemo can be as bad as the cancer, but for now, I’m really good.

SEAN	Well, you look really good. So, I guess I should go?
 
ANGELICA	You can come back later - I mean if you want.

SEAN	Yeah? When? 

ANGELICA	After dark.

SEAN	Here?

ANGELICA	Uhm...no. Wait for me outside of the building...no, next to the building, no wait behind the building.

SEAN	How about on top of the building?

ANGELICA	Whatever.

SEAN	Okay, behind the building.

ANGELICA	Wait, no, it would be too dark. The front of the building is fine.

SEAN	Are you sure?

MARK	Jell!
	
ANGELICA	I got to go. My first date - I think. Dad? 
 
MARK	Yeah?

ANGELICA	What time does it get dark?

MARK	I don’t know, maybe six. Why?

ANGELICA	No reason.

FATHER LAWRENCE	I was just thinking of you.

CHARLIE	Oh yeah?

FATHER LAWRENCE	You don’t look so good. You okay?

CHARLIE	Not sleeping much is all.

FATHER LAWRENCE	You know we have beds here.

CHARLIE	Appreciate that, but right now I have a higher calling 

FATHER LAWRENCE	Charlie, have you been drinking again? I thought you quit.

CHARLIE	Yeah. - well.
	
FATHER LAWRENCE	What happened?

CHARLIE	Ghosts. Ghosts happened. Look, if you don’t mind father, I really gotta go.

FATHER LAWRENCE	Oh yeah, of course, but one last thing, you’re friends with that boy, right?

CHARLIE	What boy is that?

FATHER LAWRENCE	That boy with no name. You know the one; the smart kid with dark hair.

CHARLIE	Did he do something wrong?

FATHER LAWRENCE	Heard he ran from the cops the other day, anybody running has to be doing it for a reason.

CHARLIE	Maybe cause they just lost, anyway I can’t wait anymore. Sorry.

SEAN	What are you doing? What do you mean? You’re a dirty run away foster kid.	No one cares about you. Why do you think your real parents abandoned you? And then you abandoned your own sister. C’mon who’s gonna love someone like that, like you. I didn’t abandon her. I saved her. That’s just an excuse and you know it. You wanted to get out of there so bad, but you couldn’t just leave her, so you invent some stupid story about -You think I invented this??? He was a monster and no one was going to believe me.	You think I was going to let him get his hands on my sister! DO YOU?! I WISH I KILLED HIM!

CHARLIE 	What’cha doing?

SEAN	Nothing.

CHARLIE	What happened to you?

SEAN	Nothing.

CHARLIE	Hm, that’s a lot of nothing. I heard you talking. Just trying to figure out to who.

SEAN	You’re just drunk again.

CHARLIE	Maybe, but it doesn’t change the fact that I heard you talking to yourself and it ain’t the first time either. I get it though. I do. Living on the streets can do that. We start fighting ourselves cause no else cares. The longer you’re alone the more it happens. You want it gone? Get off the streets.

SEAN	I’m not following.
 
CHARLIE	What do you think they see, these people, when the see us on the streets, huh?

SEAN	Who, Charlie?

CHARLIE	Everybody, and when they get past the way we look and the way we smell they just quit seeing us  altogether and it’s worse cause that’s when you become nothing, insignificant, you don’t exist anymore; you’re not even worth their spit. It’s dehumanizing, and then you start believing it - that you’re no better than the rats in the sewer, that’s when that voice inside your head gets louder. You don’t want that, Sean. You got a girl, huh? That’s good. You need good things in your life. The more good things in your life the less that voice takes you down. You start feeling good about yourself. You understand me? You’re a good kid. Whatever it is that you’re running from, don’t. This kind of life is no life, not even for the dogs. Now let me look at you. What’s her name?

SEAN	Jelly, I mean Angelica, but her parents call her Jelly.

CHARLIE	Where’s your flowers? You got a date tonight and no flowers?

SEAN	What? I didn’t know. Shoot, what should I do?

CHARLIE	Well - it’s worse to be late, (nudging him) you better get.

SEAN	Hey Charlie (a beat) what about you? (a beat) what are you running from? Maybe you should find something good too, you know?

CHARLIE	Sure. What have you become. Shut up.

MARK	What are you looking at?

ANGELICA	Nothing. It’s considered dark outside, right?

MARK	Is this a trick question? Yeah, it’s dark. Your mom should be home soon.Are you wearing makeup?

ANGELICA	Geez, can’t I just be a girl for once? Can I check the mail?

MARK	I’m trying to avoid it.

ANGELICA	Well, can I?

MARK	I don’t know. Why do you want to check the mail?

ANGELICA	I promised Tommy I’d check for his letter. He wanted to write me, what was I going to say, no? So, can I check or what? I hate lying...but this is an emergency.

MARK	Well, yeah, I guess. Be careful.
	
ANGELICA	I will.

MARK	Don’t bring back any bills either!

SEAN	Hey!

ANGELICA	Not funny!

SEAN	Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.

ANGELICA	I told you to meet me in front of the building, not inside.

SEAN	You want me to freeze to death?

ANGELICA	Oh, here. It must have slipped off at the hospital.

SEAN	Thanks. You fixed it.

ANGELICA	Yeah, I just replaced the clasp.

SEAN	That’s cool. Thanks. You don’t know how many times I almost lost this. I totally owe you.

ANGELICA	It was easy.
 
SEAN	You want to go for a walk?

ANGELICA	I don’t know.

SEAN	Just around the block, no big deal. C’mon. C’mon, it’s way too stuffy in here for a date.

ANGELICA	This is a date?

SEAN	Well, yeah, I mean not if you don’t want that.	It doesn’t have to be I was just-

ANGELICA	No, I like that. A walk would be nice.

SEAN	Sorry about the flowers.

ANGELICA	What?

SEAN	Nothing. Anyway, this is better, huh? Fresh air and all.

ANGELICA	Yeah.

SEAN	You look really nice. I mean healthy and stuff - You look pretty.

ANGELICA	So do you. I mean, handsome.
	
SEAN	Can you smell me?

ANGELICA	What?

SEAN	That was stupid.

ANGELICA	Yeah, it’s nice.

SEAN	Thanks. So, this weather, huh?

ANGELICA	You’re still trying out that small talk? Hear that?

SEAN	Unbelievable.

ANGELICA	What?

SEAN	C’mon. Ow!

ANGELICA	What happened?

SEAN	Nothing.

ANGELICA	That doesn’t look like nothing.

SEAN	Something stupid - from my past. Okay, c’mon let’s go.

ANGELICA	Where?

SEAN	I just want to show you something.

ANGELICA	I should probably get back inside. I know that song.

SEAN	Really? I think I know who’s playing.
	
ANGELICA	Who?
	
SEAN	C’mon I’ll show you. It won’t take long I promise.

HEIDI	Hey.

MARK	Oh hey.


HEIDI	I see you’re job hunting, huh? How’s that going?

MARK	I got some news.
 
HEIDI	I hope so.

MARK	How do you like the tree? I made dinner. You’re welcome.

HEIDI	Where’s Jell?

MARK	She’s not in her room?

HEIDI	No. Where is she?

MARK	Oh crap.

SEAN	He likes this park, I’m sure he’s somewhere around.

ANGELICA	Who?

SEAN	Just some homeless dude - I mean a friend. I’m glad he’s playing  again.

ANGELICA	Why did he stop?

SEAN	I don’t know, guess he got depressed or something -what are you doing?

ANGELICA	I like to let it melt on my tongue.

SEAN	Oh, you like snow, huh?

ANGELICA	Yeah, it’s just so pure and -Oh you think that’s-that’s...

SEAN	Oh no. Oh my god. Hey are you okay? Geez, what did I do. Hey. Please wake up. C’mon. What did I do? I’m so sorry. Oh you’re gonna get it now! Oh, sorry. Did I hurt you?

ANGELICA	No.

SEAN	Are you cold. 

ANGELICA	A little.

SEAN	Stars are scary.

ANGELICA	What do mean?

SEAN	I mean, look out there. It’s so - vast.	So big, so many things out there that we don’t even know about.

ANGELICA	Why is that scary?

SEAN	Just makes me feel small, worthless I guess. I mean, sometimes I feel like, what’s the point.

ANGELICA	You sound like you’re the one dying.

SEAN	Sorry. How can you know that for sure?

ANGELICA	What?

SEAN	That you’re dying. I mean people survive cancer all the time. I just don’t understand why you think you can’t be one of them. I know, it’s complicated. If you don’t want to tell me, it’s fine, I get it, it’s none of my business.

ANGELICA	No, it’s not that. I’m not trying to be negative really. My situation is just different.

SEAN	How?

ANGELICA	It has to do with my bone marrow, I need a transplant and the odds of finding a match for me are really really really low, like almost impossible.

SEAN	Is your blood that rare?

ANGELICA	It doesn’t work like that. Bone marrow is different, that’s kind’a the complicated part. My donor has to be half Latin and half white, like me to be a match.	

SEAN	I didn’t know you were a mutt.	
 

ANGELICA	Shut up. There are a lot of mutts out there, they just don’t know how important it is to be on the donor registry.

SEAN	So, why are you doing all the chemo then?

ANGELICA	Just keeping me alive.

SEAN	Until you find your mutt.

ANGELICA	Yeah.

SEAN	Well, anything’s possible. Are you scared? Hey, it’s okay.

ANGELICA	I’m sorry.

SEAN	No, it’s okay - to cry I mean. I would be so scared and pissed. I don’t know how you don’t cry all the time. It’s not fair.

ANGELICA	The worst part is that I can’t do anything about it. I can’t make myself better, I can’t make it go away and everybody expects me to be strong and brave and I’m not. I’m not. I don’t want to die, Sean.

 SEAN	Just don’t give up, okay? Okay? Promise me.

ANGELICA	I promise.

OFFICER DANIEL	HEY! The park is closed.

SEAN	What? So early?

OFFICER DANIEL	Closes at dusk. C’mon get up and get out of here. Your parents know you’re out here?

ANGELICA	Yes.

OFFICER DANIEL	I know you.

SEAN	Don’t worry we’re leaving.

OFFICER DANIEL	You’re that kid from the shelter.

SEAN	AWhat?

OFFICER DANIEL	I want to talk to you. You need a ride home?

ANGELICA	I just live around the corner. But I can wait.

OFFICER DANIEL	Not giving you a choice.

ANGELICA	What did he do? We didn’t do anything. We were just-

SEAN	It’s okay. I’ll see you tomorrow, I mean if that’s alright with you.

OFFICER DANIEL	He’s gonna be alright. Just got some questions for him. You go on home now, understand?
 
MARK	Where were you?

HEIDI	Never mind. She’s home.
 
ANGELICA	I just went for a walk.

MARK	A walk? Do you know how long you were gone?

ANGELICA	I lost track of time.

HEIDI	Oh honey, we were so worried.

ANGELICA	Who were you talking to?

HEIDI	The police.

ANGELICA	The police???

MARK	We couldn’t find you when you wandered off, what did you expect us to do?

ANGELICA	I didn’t wander. Why did you have to call the police?

HEIDI	We didn’t know what happened?

ANGELICA	C’mon, I’m not a kid! I can’t believe you did that!

MARK	We thought that you were kidnapped or something. One minute you’re getting the mail and then next you’re gone.

ANGELICA	You act like I’m so incapable, I’m just so sick and tired of it!

MARK	Whoa, where is this coming from?

HEIDI	Honey, we were just concerned that’s all. Everything’s fine now, okay?

ANGELICA	That’s exactly what I’m talking about. Everything’s not fine and I wish you would quit pretending like everything’s just going to work out. I have cancer, get over it, cause I did - a long time ago. I don’t want to be coddled anymore, or be treated like you have to protect me from all the bad news. You have no job and you have no life and I have no donor. Those are the facts and if I want to go on a walk around my stupid building, then I should without my parents calling the cops!

MARK	Uh, whoa.

HEIDI	Where are you going?

MARK	We should go talk to her - shouldn’t we?

HEIDI	No, let her be. She’ll be alright.

SEAN	Charlie!

CHARLIE	What are you doing here? You can’t just barge in someone’s tent!

SEAN	I’m sorry. I have no where else to go.

CHARLIE	From where? Who you running from? What did you do this time? I told you to quit stealing! I told you that-

SEAN	-Never mind.

CHARLIE	Don’t be stupid. Sit. Are you okay? Hungry? So, tell me about your date, Angelica?

SEAN	Jelly.

CHARLIE	Jelly? What kind of name is that?

SEAN	It’s what her parents call her. I like it.

CHARLIE	Yeah, I bet you do.

HEIDI	Really?

MARK	Really what?

HEIDI	This is your idea of looking for a job?

MARK	I got an interview today. Satisfied?

HEIDI	Don’t do that. Don’t make me out like I’m the bad guy here.

MARK	I’m not. But you really have to lay off a little bit. I’ve been searching and making a bunch of calls, it’s not easy finding a night shift job that works with our schedule. We can’t leave her alone during the day and what if she needs chemo again?

HEIDI	I know. I’m sorry. That’s great about the job. What is it?

MARK	A janitor.

HEIDI	You’re a good man.

MARK	I don’t like it when you’re mad at me.

HEIDI	I’m just scared and now after everything she said last night, I feel awful. I didn’t realize that she felt that way.

MARK	She’s growing up. I guess we should just include her in on everything, or at least not pretend like she’s five.

HEIDI	Shoot, I’m gonna be late. I’ll go check on her. Weird, she never sleeps this late. MARK! GET IN HERE! HURRY!

SEAN	What are you doing? That’s not yours.

CHARLIE	Who is she? Is that her? Jelly?

SEAN	You can’t be looking at people’s stuff, man.

CHARLIE	Is it her???

SEAN	Yeah, geez. Hey, huh, thanks for letting me crash - you okay? Okay, I got to go.

TOMMY 	She’s not home.

SEAN	Geez, you scared me! Where did you come from?

TOMMY	She’s not home.

SEAN	Yeah, you said that already. What are you doing here?

TOMMY	She’s at the hospital. She’s dying.

SEAN	What??? She was good last night. Are you sure?

TOMMY	You have to go see her.

SEAN	I can’t, I mean I want to, but I’ll get arrested.

TOMMY	Is that more important? You’ll never do anything good if you keep running, Sean - even from the bad stuff.

SEAN	Yeah -How did you get so smart?

TOMMY	You’re gonna save her, you know.

SEAN	Well, I don’t know about that. I’ll see you later, Tommy. Hey Tommy, how did you know I would even be here? Tommy?

DOCTOR PALMER	All her numbers are dangerously low right now.

MARK	How did that happen? I mean she was fine last night.

DOCTOR PALMER	Her bone marrow flooded her blood stream with abnormal blood cells, they basically took over -it’s hard to say why it happened, but we can’t wait any longer.

HEIDI	Are we talking about chemo again?
 	
DOCTOR PALMER	Her body is too weak. We knew this could happen. She’s going to need the transplant now.

MARK	How much is it? I mean, we haven’t heard anything from the registry.	Did you find a match?

DOCTOR PALMER	We haven’t, but I’ll keep reaching out to them of course, make sure there’s nothing missed. Have you already contacted other relatives?

HEIDI	Yeah, there’s no one out there.

MARK	There’s got to be something else that we can do, I mean at least until a donor is found. I read about this company, they got some new medicine for MDS, what about that?

DOCTOR PALMER	I know what you’re talking about, but Angelica’s condition is too advanced - Look, let me make some calls and see what we have out there. In the meantime spend as much time as you can with her.

MARK	I think we need to try those new drugs I was reading about.

HEIDI	No.

MARK	No? What are you talking about?

HEIDI	He said they weren’t effective for her. We’ll find her match.

MARK	Heidi, I don’t have a job yet, it’s just an interview, so don’t forget we still don’t have insurance.

HEIDI	I know that.

MARK	And when the hospital finds out what do you think will happen, they’ll just give it to us for free?

HEIDI	I don’t know Mark, you want her to just die, is that it?
	
MARK	Don’t be stupid. I’m just telling you our situation.

HEIDI	Don’t ever call me stupid. You know it’s easy to point out the problems, anyone can do that, but you don’t seem to have any solutions. You can’t seriously believe that just because we have no insurance they’re not going to help us. Maybe you just didn’t try hard enough to get your job back.

MARK	You have no idea why I got fired, do you?

HEIDI	It doesn’t matter anymore.

MARK	Yeah it does. I was sleeping at the job, and I was always late. I became a liability and you know why? Doctor appointments and hospital stays and chemo and because we only have one car. I told you to quit the diner a long time ago. Losing my job is as much your fault as it is mine!

HEIDI	Your wrong. This IS your fault. We all have to make sacrifices. I can’t help it if you can’t handle yours.

MARK	You’re never around, you’ve never been around! I HATE YOU! Brandon?

BRANDON	Hey Mr. Jacob.
	
FATHER LAWRENCE	Why are you hurting my door?

MARK	I’m- I’m sorry, I just- I didn’t know if you were open.

FATHER LAWRENCE	The doors sticks, but we’re always open.

BRANDON	I gotta go. Thank you. See you around, Mr. Jacob.
	
MARK	Is he okay?

FATHER LAWRENCE	He will be. But you don’t look too good. Why don’t you come in before you have to buy me a new door. So what’s got you so upset?

MARK	My daughter’s dying.

FATHER LAWRENCE	I’m sorry to hear that. What’s her name?

MARK	Jelly, it’s what her mom and I call her. Her name is Angelica.

FATHER LAWRENCE	It’s a beautiful name. How old is she.

MARK	Seventeen.

FATHER LAWRENCE	Is she at St. Johns? They’re good there. They’ll take good care of her.

MARK	We don’t have insurance and she’ll die without a donor. We just don’t have that kind of money. I failed her, my baby.

FATHER LAWRENCE	No, it’s nothing you did. We forget sometimes that none of this is in our hands.	You know there are a lot of charities and non- profits that could help. I’ll reach out for you. Okay? What’s your name?

MARK	Mark.

FATHER LAWRENCE	Are you a religious man, Mark?

MARK	I don’t know what I am anymore.

FATHER LAWRENCE	Will you indulge me?

TOMMY	Hey.

ANGELICA	What are you doing here?

TOMMY	I brought you something.

ANGELICA	Is that Sean’s? But I already gave it to him. Yeah, see. I fixed this. How did you get it?

TOMMY	Sometimes people need proof.

ANGELICA	For what?

TOMMY	Sssh. He’s coming to give you something.

ANGELICA	He doesn’t know I’m here.

TOMMY	I told him.

ANGELICA	I don’t understand.

TOMMY	You don’t have to. I wanted to say bye and let you know that everything’s going to be okay.

ANGELICA	What’s he going to give me?

HEIDI 	Honey, you okay?

ANGELICA	Tommy?

HEIDI	Honey, you’re up.

ANGELICA	Did you see Tommy?

HEIDI	Tommy? No, no one’s here but me. Are you feeling okay?

ANGELICA	Sorry for yelling at you guys last night.

HEIDI	No baby, you were right. We’re the one’s who are sorry. You’re burning up. I’m going to get the doctor.

NURSE BECKY	Excuse me.

SEAN	I’m looking for Jelly, I mean Angelica. She’s a patient. I was told she’s here.

NURSE BECKY	Are you a relative?

SEAN	No.

NURSE BECKY	Who told you she was here?

SEAN	I mean I’ve been here before to see her, that other nurse knows me.

NURSE BECKY	Well, I’m not that other nurse. Now you should go.

SEAN	But Tommy told me that she was here today.

NURSE BECKY	Tommy?

SEAN	Yeah, he’s about this high, I think 11 or 12. Bright kid. Bald. But then again, everyone’s bald.

NURSE BECKY	You’re talking about Tommy Lassador.

SEAN	Yeah, I guess. I don’t know his last name.

NURSE BECKY	When did he tell you this?

SEAN	Today.

NURSE BECKY	I think you should leave.

SEAN	Well, is she here or what?

NURSE BECKY	No, she’s not. I’m not going to ask you again.

SEAN	Why would Tommy lie to me?

NURSE BECKY	He didn’t. I mean, you couldn’t have talked to him today. I’m sorry, but Tommy died a few days ago.
 
SEAN	What??? No, that’s not possible.

NURSE BECKY	You can come back tomorrow and talk to the doctor if you want.

SEAN	He died??? I don’t believe you. Tommy? Where are you? C’mon, quit joking around. Oh great.

JACK	Stop.

NURSE LAUREN	Hey, no running!

JACK	Did you see a kid running through here?

NURSE LAUREN	He went that way.

NURSE CHERYL	Can I help you?

SEAN	Oh, I just need a bathroom.

NURSE CHERYL	That way to the left.

SEAN	Thanks. Angelica? What are you doing here?

ANGELICA	I don’t want you to see me this way. I wish Tommy didn’t tell you anything.

SEAN	Tommy?

ANGELICA	Yeah, he told me you were coming.

SEAN	When? When was he here?

ANGELICA	Maybe 20 minutes ago.

SEAN	Oh my god.

ANGELICA	What’s wrong?

SEAN	She said Tommy died.

ANGELICA	Who?

SEAN	The nurse.

ANGELICA	But he was just here, he looked healthy. It must be a mistake.

SEAN	Right, he looked really healthy. Like he wasn’t even sick. When’s the last time you saw him not look sick?

ANGELICA	What are saying?

SEAN	The nurse said he died two days ago Angelica, two days ago. But we both saw him today, at about the same time. That’s not possible is it?

ANGELICA	He gave it to me, he said you would come, he said some people need proof.

JACK	There you are! C’mon, let’s go.

ANGELICA	It’s okay.

JACK	I’m sorry, but he’s not supposed to be here.

ANGELICA	But he’s my boy- I mean he’s my friend.

JACK	Well, he can come back tomorrow during visiting hours. You need to get rest, okay?

ANGELICA	Sean. He said you would give me something.

SEAN	What?

ANGELICA	I don’t know. What did he tell you?

JACK	Let’s go.

SEAN	Don’t do that anymore. You don’t need hair to be beautiful. I don’t care if you ever have it again.

ANGELICA 	Oh my God. Oh my God.

SEAN	I have to go. Remember, you promised. You would never give up.

ANGELICA 	I won’t.

JACK	Is that your girlfriend?

SEAN	Yeah.

JACK	She has leukemia?

SEAN	No, it’s something else, myelody something syndrome. She says that her bone-

JACK	Her bone marrow is failing?

SEAN	Yeah.

JACK	Did she already have chemotherapy?

SEAN	Yeah.

JACK	Oh.

SEAN	Oh? That’s not exactly the response I was looking for.

JACK	Maybe you shouldn’t ask me.

SEAN	It’s that bad?

JACK	She’s gonna need a bone marrow transplant.

SEAN	She said she can’t find a match.

JACK	Oooh.

SEAN	Really. What does it take?

JACK	To be a match? Start with a swab.

SEAN	Then what?

JACK	Then if you’re match, they withdraw the marrow from you.

ANGELICA 	He said that you would give me something.

TOMMY 	You’re going to save her life, Sean.

SEAN	It’s me - I’m the match.

JACK	Well, we won’t know until we test you.

SEAN	Fine, let’s do it. But it’s me. I’m telling you.

JACK	If you are a match, are you willing to go through excruciating unbearable pain? I mean, serious serious pain.

SEAN	What are we waiting for?

JACK	She must really be something.

SEAN	She is.

JACK	Alright, let’s go to the lab. Oh, and I was just kidding about the pain.

SEAN	Charlie? (a beat) What are you doing here?

CHARLIE	Same thing you are. Take care of yourself, Sean.

JACK	You know him?

SEAN	I do. But not like that.

JACK	C’mon, we don’t have a lot of time.

SEAN	He looks really good.

CHARLIE	Mark. It’s gonna be okay.

ANGELICA 	It was true, Tommy died two days before he visited us. But he wasn’t alone. He was never alone. I never found out who Jenny and Emily were, but one things for sure, I’ll never forget them. Since Sean didn’t know anything about his biological parents, he never knew his ethnicity, but turns out that he was my match, which the doctor said was a miracle and one day later, he was donating his bone marrow. Tommy told me that night that Sean was coming back to give me something. Who would have thought it was my life. After the surgery, Sean went home to see his sister. The cops were nice enough to let that happen before he was prosecuted. Because their last foster dad was guilty of abuse, Sean only had to do community service for 6 months cause you can’t push people down the stairs even if they deserve it. And Jazmine got the only thing she wanted, her big brother.

BRANDON	What are you humming?

ANGELICA	Oh, I don’t know. It’s just a song I heard once. Tommy knew it too, didn’t he?

BRANDON	Yeah, every time he was scared or in pain he would hum that song. I don’t even know where he got it from.

HEIDI	It’s the same song that homeless man played, wasn’t it?	

MARK	Honey, are you okay?	

ANGELICA	Yeah, will you excuse me? I never quit hearing that song, I guess it was just stuck in my head. I hope it never goes away.

MARK	Jell? There’s someone at the door.

SEAN	Merry Christmas.
