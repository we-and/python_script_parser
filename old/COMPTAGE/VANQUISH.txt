DAMON	Bless me Father… for I have sinned. Its been two weeks since my last confession.

FATHER THOMAS	Proceed.

DAMON	You already know my sins Tom.

FATHER THOMAS	I do. 

DAMON	You also already know that I’ve stepped off the righteous path.

FATHER THOMAS	We all have. A million six from the south side and drug money was a little light this month an’ prostitution was down a little too. Under eight hundred thousand. Gambling is up. The skim was a million one last month.

DAMON	Is there any way to come back . . . to the path?

FATHER THOMAS	Are you serious?

DAMON	I’m not sure but it feels good to contemplate it.

FATHER THOMAS	I’m afraid that I do not have the spiritual answer you’re looking for. 

DAMON	There’s a woman.

FATHER THOMAS	Your caretaker?

DAMON	Yes.

FATHER THOMAS	Are you having impure thoughts?

DAMON	No, no, no. She’s in a tough spot with her daughter.

FATHER THOMAS	An’ you want to help?

DAMON	It would help me to help her.

FATHER THOMAS	How about the pickups?

DAMON	Same spots.

FATHER THOMAS	I hear there’s a problem. 

DAMON	Same problem?

FATHER THOMAS	Yes. 

DAMON	Hmm, that rumor’s been around forever. 

FATHER THOMAS	Yeah but I understand this time they’re taking it very seriously.

DAMON	So let them.

FATHER THOMAS	All these things going on, you can sleep at night?

DAMON	I keep everyone else awake. I sleep just fine.

CHILDS	You hit him too hard.

KEHOE	I don’t believe we hit him hard enough. 

STEVENS	Don’t be nodding out on us.
STEVENS	Wake up, wake up ...

CHILDS	What if we are wrong about this guy?

KEHOE	If we are wrong, we’re just wrong.

CHILDS	If he comes out of his coma, he’s going to lawyer up... He’s gonna go after all of us.

KEHOE	I don’t think he’s coming out of anything.

CHILDS	Shit. 

CHILDS	Fuck, what did you do?

CHILDS	Fuck, what did you do?

KEHOE	What did I do! You mean, what did WE do! Don’t start that shit boy. We in this thing together.

STEVENS	You, you need to remember who your friends are. Don’t get soft on us now. Remember you begged us to let you in on this.

BJ	Hey guys...

STEVENS	Not now.
 
CHILDS 	Fuck.

BJ	Guys.

STEVENS	Not now B.J.

KEHOE	He’s gotta have it hidden on him somewhere. Check his pants. Check his pants.

CHILDS	I’m not doing that.

BJ	Kehoe.

STEVENS	Shut up

BJ	Guys

STEVENS	I said shut up.

BJ	Kehoe.

KEHOE	Fuck. It ain’t here.

STEVENS	Maybe you should fish down there a little bit more?

KEHOE	Fuck you.

BJ	Hey, looking for this?

KEHOE	Son of a bitch. Where did you find that?

BJ	In his locker.

KEHOE	That’s perfect timing BJ.

KEHOE	That’s a good find. Thank you 

CHILDS	You were right. Son of a bitch was gonna rat us out.

KEHOE	I’m always right. That’s why I’m in charge.

STEVENS	This ain’t over ya know. 

STEVENS	There has to be other tapes. We don’t know who else he’s been talking to.

KEHOE	Why don’t you leave that to me and the people above your pay grade, Stevens. Now get his ass out of here.

CHILDS	You got it.

DAMON	Yeah.

KEHO	Hey, it’s Kehoe

DAMON	Go ahead.

KEHOE	Well it ain’t good. He was wearing a wire.

DAMON	Fuck. All right, well you’d better get over to his house. It won’t be long before some other agency gets wind of this, if they haven’t already.

KEHOE	You bet. 

KEHOE	What are we gonna do about the pickups?

DAMON	We’ll just have to figure something out. 

KEHOE	Send one of us.

DAMON	No, no, absolutely not. Who knows who’s watching.

KEHOE	Who the hell can we trust?

DAMON	Let me handle it. 

VICTORIA	Hey Damon. I’m, sorry we’re late. 

DAMON	No worries. How’s my sweet little angel? Something wrong honey?

VICTORIA	Let’s make you some dinner, huh.

DAMON	Okay.

VICTORIA	Come on, Baby.

VICTORIA	Hey baby

VICTORIA	Everything is going to be okay, I promise. 

VICTORIA	All right so how about Mama does some cooking tonight and you can watch, huh?

LILY	Yeah.

VICTORIA	You like that?

LILY	Yup.

VICTORIA	All right. Let’s see what we got!

DAMON	Yeah.

KEHOE 	So I sent BJ 

KEHOE	to Rick’s place.

KEHOE	It was covered in Feds.

DAMON	All right, get lost.

KEHOE 	I’m just worried they’re gonna find something. 

DAMON	You forget who you’re talking to?

DAMN	I’ve got a long reach. Stop worrying. 

KEHOE	All right. You’re the boss. Son of a bitch.

DAMON	Vicky.

DAMON	Vicky. Can we talk for a minute?

VICTORIA	Yeah, of course.

VICTORIA	I’ll coming right back, okay.

DAMON	What’s going on? Tell me. Did get bad news?

VICTORIA	Yeah.

DAMON	Let me help you.

VICTORIA	Damon I hope you realize how appreciative we are for everything you’ve done for us.  

VICTORIA	Truly, thank you. Unfortunately, this is just one thing you can’t help us with.

DAMON	Yes I can.

VICTORIA	It’s bad. And no one even knows for sure what it really is. Test after test. Doctor after doctor. 

DAMON	We’ll figure it out. Together.

VICTORIA	You know she’s the first thing I ever did right. And she’s perfect. It’s just not fair.

DAMON	No, it isn’t. 

VICTORIA	Sometimes I wonder if God is just punishing me for all the terrible things I’ve done in my life. It’s not a nice feeling.

DAMON	I don’t think God works that way.

VICTORIA	Maybe not but if he did I just, I wish he would make me suffer. That I could handle. That would actually make sense. But not her.

DAMON	Let me pay for it. You two are about all I have left. 

VICTORIA	Damon.

DAMON	I would need something in return.

VICTORIA	Of course, Damon, I would do anything for you. Regardless, just name it.

DAMON	It would involve using some of your old skills. 

DAMON	I need you tonight. Five stops. Five pickups. 

VICTORIA	Pickups? What kind of pickups?

DAMON	Money. Lots of it.

VICTORIA	I don’t think I understand where this conversation is going.

DAMON	You don’t? Or you don’t want to? Now come on. You didn’t think for one minute that I got all of this from my injury?

VICTORIA	I never questioned it.

DAMON	You never wanted to. I’m sure you heard things about me.

VICTORIA	Of course. The difference is I know you so I never believed any of it.

DAMON	Believe it. All of it. You are the only person I know I can completely trust.

VICTORIA	I need you to stop. I can’t even be having this conversation. I can’t do that for you.

DAMON	I will take care of you and lily.

VICTORIA	I made myself a promise that I would never do this again.

DAMON	I don’t see that you have much choice.

VICTORIA	You’re right, I don’t have a choice. I have Lily and it’s not safe for me out there. There are too people that are waiting for me to make this exact mistake. I’ll find another way because if something were to happen to me...

DAMON	See that it doesn’t. Victoria, I know I needn’t remind you that you have your daughter because of me. You would be in jail and she’d be in a state facility. Take a minute. 

DAMON	Think about it.

KEHOE	Of all the nights for this to happen.

CHILDS	Maybe we dodged a bullet. This money goes all the way to the Governor tonight and if she got implicated...

KEHOE	Oh lord, don’t go there. You know you may be right. Hell, we may all get lucky.

DAMON	Well?

VICTORIA	I can’t, I have a daughter now. Oh and Damon Fix your own damn dinner. Lily.Lillian? Where is she? Where is she?

DAMON	She’s safe. 

VICTORIA	I will cut out your heart!

DAMON	Now Vicky There’s no need for any of this. See. Now think about it. If you kill me you’ll never be able to find her. 

DAMON	You do what I tell you to do and everything will be just fine, I promise.

VICTORIA	Wow.

DAMON	Good. Let’s get you suited up, shall we.

DAMON	Help yourself.

DAMON	There’s a body cam there. Take it and there’s a camera on the helmet. I’ll give you each stop one at a time. You bring the money back. I give you the next stop. That how it goes, okay.

VICTORIA	Okay. Just in case I wasn’t clear when this is over so are we.

DAMON	I know.

DAMON	All right your first stop is seven, five, one, Keller Street. German night club. 

DAMON	Do you speak German? 

VICTORIA	A little bit.

VICTORIA	My German isn’t perfect but I understand everything.

DAMON	I’m sure you’ll get by.

STEVENS	Good evening, Detectives.

KEHOE	BJ

KEHOE	So you’re telling me that Ricks place was covered in Feds.

BJ	Yeah.

KEHOE	You know one of them.

BJ	Yes, I do.

KEHOE	Which one?

BJ	The one running the show.

CHILDS	And?

BJ	And what? Will they play ball? I dunno maybe. Maybe not.

CHILDS	You’re so helpful.

BJ	I can’t speak for ‘em, can I?

KEHOE	Listen, Damon ain’t worried.

STEVENS	He never worries.

CHILDS	It only takes one fucking boy scout to take down that enterprise.

STEVENS	-That can’t happen. They won’t allow it. Too many people get hurt. Use your head.

KEHOE	So you’re telling me that you know one of these guys.

BJ	Yeah. If you want I could talk to him for ya. 

KEHOE	I want him on our team.

BJ	All right.

VICTORIA	I made myself a promisethat I would never do this again. 

LILY	Mom.

DAMON	I don’t see that you have much choice. Five stops. Five pick-ups.

VICTORIA	What kind of pick-ups? Damon Money. Lots of it.

LILY	Mom? 

LILY	Help me!

DAMON	Kill me you’ll never be able to find her. You do what I tell you to do and everything will be just fine. I promise.

VICTORIA	I will cut out your heart...

VICTORIA	When this is over so are we.

DAMON	I know.

DAMON	Turn your helmet so it faces the door. Let’s keep everyone honest.

VICTORIA	Did you have trouble here?

DAMON	There’s trouble everywhere. Rival gangs. Sticky fingers. Plus, you’re a woman.

VICTORIA	Huh. Funny. All right. What do I say?

DAMON	You’re there to see Erik.

VICTORIA	Erik.

CURTIS	What about him?

VICTORIA	Don’t waste my fucking time.

CURTIS	For me, there should be a little less of that dress. Yeah.

GALYNA	That will cost you.

CURTIS 	Okay

ERIC	Meet Damon’s new errand boy. Ha!

VICTORIA	Girl, asshole.

CURTIS	Everything

DAMON	Yeah a long undistinguished list.

GALYNA	Get me out of here, please.

VICTORIA	Yeah.

DAMON	Don’t make this more complicated than it needs to be.

VICTORIA	What can I say? She needed help.

DAMON	This is no time for personal wars, Victoria.

VICTORIA	Wow, that is rich coming from you. Let’s not forget who made this personal.

DAMON	He said he knew you. How?

VICTORIA	What’s it to you anyway?

DAMON	Well, they’ll be out all night looking for you. Sooner or later they’ll come here.

VICTORIA	Pity.

DAMON	How does he know you?

VICTORIA	That’s what happens when you put me in a room with the piece of shit that killed my brother. We good?

DAMON	One Thousand East End.

DAMON	That’s the place. Be careful in there.

VICTORIA	What the hell is this place?

DAMON	It’s like a bad dream, isn’t it?

VICTORIA	This whole thing is like a bad dream.

JOHNNY	Billy Smalls.

VICTORIA 	Wait, really? Mr. Smalls. You gotta admit it kind of lends itself to like a dozen inappropriate jokes. Am I right fellas, huh? All right it’s a tough crowd. You win some you lose some. Get the fuck up? Can he go any slower? Because if he can I will have to kill him. It’s not personal. Fill the bag. 

JOHNNY	Do it. Do it!

VICTORIA	And zip it up. Be a gentleman and hand it to Mr. Smalls.

DAMON	He’s got a gun.

VICTORIA	Ohhhh! I wouldn’t do that. I’m a really good shot and ah your boy here is a, he’s a pretty big target

DAMON	Victoria. Vicky.

DAMON	Take a left. 

DAMON	Hello?

KEHOE	What’s going on out there?

DAMON	You know what going on out there.

KEHOE	I know she took out Eric and his crew.

DAMON	Well, it turns out that he killed her brother. 

KEHOE	And you didn’t know that?

DAMON	Well I wasn’t as sure as I am now.

KEHOE	Well I think these federal agents are wanting to meet.

DAMON	Told you

DAMON	everybody has a price. 

KEHOE	She done made another mess on the east side.

DAMON	That was Max. He controls them. He must have called ahead. 

KEHOE	Well tell your girl no more fireworks. 

DAMON	Tell Max to butt out. 

KEHOE	Like he gonna listen to me?

DAMON	Make him.

KEHOE	Hey it’s me again. I just get off the phone with Damon. You’ve got to let her go.

MAX	No! I’m gonna kill this bitch right now.

DAMON	You need to get yourself turned around. You’re trapped.

DAMON	Fuck

MAX	Get the truck and block the exit.

DAMON	Okay, up ahead. All right the exit’s just ahead. Shit.

DAMON 	Oh shit.

MAX	No!

DAMON 	All right.

DAMON	How do you feel?

LILY	I’m tired. I’m always tired.

DAMON	Me too. Well your mother will be back soon. Get some sleep.

DAMON	My, my, my. That was quite a show. 

VICTORIA	Where’s Lily?

DAMON	Still safe.

VICTORIA	I need to know where she is.

DAMON	You’ve got three more stops.

VICTORIA	Fuck this

VICTORIA	Just tell me where she is.

DAMON	Three more stops.

VICTORIA	I can’t believe that I actually thought for the first time in my life someone gave a  damn about us. So if you’re not going to tell where she is then tell me why. Why Damon?

DAMON	You ran drugs for the Russians. You were a courier in and out of Moscow. You and your brother are suspected of even more, including murder. So stop with the babe in the woods routine, okay. You’ve got three more stops.

VICTORIA	Why did I have you on a pedestal.

DAMON	Three more stops. 

VICTORIA	America’s police commissioner. Wow.

DAMON	Three. More. Stops.

VICTORIA	If anything happens to her, if there’s a single scratch on her body. I swear to god...

MONROE	This is a crooked cop convention? So how much we talking about here?

KEHOE	It would depend on what’s on them tapes.

MONROE	Well they’re not good. Big mess for everyone for everyone involved. Even the little we’ve heard. 

KEHOE	Oh yeah So what have you heard? How detailed is it?

MONROE	I would say that they are detailed enough. 

KEHOE	You got names?

MONROE	Oh, we certainly do, Detective Kehoe. The problem is, is that, uh, he wasn’t just wearing a wire. He was taping phone calls. Phone calls and wires going back two years. We’re talking the Governor on down.

KEHOE	And?

MONROE	And. Well and is just that I don’t know. I mean this could be the biggest case of my career, man. Cush job in Washington. A talking head on T.V. I mean, just look at this face, huh. I belong on television, don’t I?

KEHOE	Yeah. I suppose. 

MONROE	Well, taking that into consideration, the deal that we might strike would have to a make a whole hell lot of sense. 

KEHOE	Oh it makes sense.

MONROE	I’m gonna make a call.

VICTORIA	What kind of a Priest are you?

FATHER THOMAS	I stopped being a Priest a long time ago.

DAMON 	Don’t go back the way you came. 

DAMON	They’re over at your bike.

FATHER THOMAS	Be safe.

FATHER THOMAS	I know Damon cares about you. 

VICTORIA	Bullshit.

FATHER THOMAS	And your daughter.

VICTORIA	Hey Baby.

VICTORIA	That was easy.

VICTORIA	This Nazi won’t let it go. Any suggestions, Damon?

DAMON	Left two blocks. There’s a back alley. Now he won’t be able to follow you there

VICTORIA 	Where the fuck is it?

DAMON	Take a left!

VICTORIA	How many times can I turn left?

DAMON	As many times as needed.

VICTORIA	I’m gonna to be back to square one.

DAMON	Left, left.

VICTORIA	Fuck you and your left

DAMON	Nicely done.

MAX	Fucking shit

VICTORIA	Hey!

VICTORIA	Who the hell is this guy?

DAMON	What does it matter?

VICTORIA	He’s a cop.

DAMON	Dirty cop.

VICTORIA	Is there any other kind in this city?

DAMON	He was particularly bad.

VICTORIA	What the fuck are you?

DAMON	Again. What does it matter?

VICTORIA	It matters because the only person allowed to kill you is me, after I get my daughter back.

DAMON	It’s none of your concern.

VICTORIA	Everything is my concern. 

DAMON	You’ve got two more stops.

VICTORIA	All right, I can play this game. Hmmm I put money on him being your partner. So there’s only two options greed or a double cross. Which one was it?

DAMON	It doesn’t concern you.

VICTORIA	I need to get my daughter back!

DAMON	He probably thought his youth and strength would help him. There’s no match for age and cunning, is it? In a couple of hours, you’ll be totally free of all of this.

VICTORIA	Are you insane? We will never be free of this! You’re making damn sure of that!

DAMON	Trust me. Two more stops...and get rid of that for me. 

LILY	Mom.

LILY 	Help! Me!

RAYO	Well, hot damn! You must be the infamous runner de jour. How you doin’ honey? My name is Rayo. Not that hard to say-o. Okay-o? 

RAYO	Is that Damon? Hi Z’s!

RAYO	How ya doin’, Tiger? Wish you were here and all that shit.

RAYO	Well, you’ve had quite an evening. I heard you killed more people than Quentin Tarantino. Fancy about a Mint Julep?

VICTORIA	No.

RAYO	Oh, come on. Let your hair down. Metaphorically, cause you ain’t got much there.Ahhhhhhhh. After all that murder and mayhem. I mean, you’d think that you’d be parched. C’mon, have a little sippy sip. Mommy don’t like to drink alone. Oh hush. You don’t trust little old me?

VICTORIA	I don’t trust anybody, but I’ll take you water. Yeah, I’ll take that then. Cheers 

DAMON	Keep an eye on him. 

DAMON	He’s a snake.

RAYO	These are my boys. This is Boy Cock, Man Cock, Robo Cock. Money! Oh boys, not that you ain’t money, but you ain’t. Ah, boys, hello. This here, is Miss...

VICTORIA	I’m not here to socialize. I’m here to get this.

RAYO	Okay

RAYO	You are strong. 

DAMON	Shit.

RAYO	You should be You are strong Kicking in right about Kicking in now. Right about now

DAMON	Vicky? Vicky?

RAYO	I told you. It was the best in town.

DAMON	Vicky, Don’t pass out.

DAMON	Stay awake. Stay awake. Don’t pass out.

RAYO	It’s the best in town.

DAMON	Don’t pass out.

RAYO	I can’t believe you don’t remember me. I knew your brother quite well.

DAMON 	Don’t pass out, Vicky. Don’t pass out.

RAYO	He worked for me multiple times and even ripped me off.... This was before he worked for Damon.

DAMON	Listen to my voice. Stay with me.

RAYO	Now before you tell me you don’t know anything about this.

DAMON	Don’t pass out Vicky.

RAYO	I went to your brother’s place... and you were there. I questioned him and questioned him. He claimed that he knew nothing about anything. 

DAMON	Don’t pass out.

RAYO	But you and I both know that is bull fucking shit. 

DAMON	Damn it, just 

DAMON	don’t, don’t pass out.

RAYO	My friend had an arms deal... a million dollars. I helped broker. The last thing I heard from him is that he met a beautiful Australian woman in a bar in Berlin.

DAMON	Damn it Vic, don’t pass out. 

DAMON	Stay with me.

RAYO	Sound familiar? 

RAVO	The description matches you to a T. 

DAMON	Fight it Vic

RAVO	I never saw my friend again. Nor the money. Later I learned that was what you and brother did. You guys stole cash from curriers that were moving it back and forth. You seduced He-Rod. How happy I was when I heard you were going to be here tonight.

DAMON	Vicky. Vicky. The coke. The coke! 

RAYO	Oh, are you trying to talk? I can’t hear you.

RAYO	No!

DAMON	Vicky

VICTORIA	And they say that shit will kill you.

KEHOE	So?

MONROE	You have no idea how lucky you are.

KEHOE	Okay, why is that?

MONROE	Well, the officer that bit it tonight, you’re lucky you took him out when you did. 

MONROE	And a, you’re lucky to have the FBI as your new partners. 

KEHOE	All right, so what’s this gonna cost?

MONROE	Well you know, peace of mind don’t come cheap. 

KEHOE	I didn’t think it would.

MONROE	They were just about to go to the D.E.A. 

KEHOE	They?

MONROE	Homeland Security, the whole nine yards. 

KEHOE	No, no, no, now you said they? Who’s they?

MONROE	Well, before we get into that, you and I are gonna have to have an understanding.

KEHOE	All right, let’s talk.

MONROE	We want half. Yeah.

STEVENS	Half?

KEHOE	He wants half.

MONROE	Half the whole operation.

KEHOE	You know what? If I’s a bettin’ man, which I am. I’d bet that’s not gonna happen.

MONROE	Well if I was you, I would make it happen. If I was you, I’d be worried about all the scum bags that might get their feelings hurt when they find out what you allowed to go down right under your god damn crooked cop nose. Do we have a deal?

KEHOE	It ain’t entirely up to me. 

MONROE	Well then, you know, I guess I’ll just send the tapes on up the chain, right. Time is not your friend, Friend. 

DAMON	Hello.

KEHOE	Damon?

DAMON	That’s right.

KEHOE	What are you doing answering Childs’ phone?

DAMON	Well, he’s dead.

KEHOE	He’s what?

DAMON	Yeah. I shot him. 

KEHOE	And he’s dead?

DAMON	I’m pretty sure.

KEHOE	You’re kidding me? What happened?

DAMON	You’d have to ask him. 

KEHOE	So you’re not gonna elaborate?

DAMON	He came into my home, didn’t say a word, pulled a gun on me so I shot him.

KEHOE	And you had no idea?

DAMON	I’m sure he had a good reason. We just didn’t have time to talk.

KEHOE	Well the Feds said Rick has a partner.

DAMON	Maybe Childs. I never liked him. Trusted him even less.

KEHOE	Okay, well, they want half of everything. 

DAMON	They could have asked for more.

KEHOE	You’re good with that?

DAMON	You’ve got my vote. 

KEHOE	Well okay. So I guess everybody is gonna have to weigh in.

DAMON	Well, get the tapes, start listening. We’ll figure it all out. 

DAMON	Almost done. One more stop. 

VICTORIA	Where?
  
DAMON	The Convention Center. Marcel Gauthier. 

VICTORIA	The union boss? You saved the best for last.

DAMON	When you get back, I’ll tell you how to find Lillian.

MARCEL	Park and leave your motorcycle there...

MARCEL	Vicky It’s been a while, Vicky. What’s that? Is that cocaine?

VICTORIA	I just came from a party.

MARCEL	Nice. 

VICTORIA	Where’s the money.

MARCEL	That’s Damon, right?

MARCEL	The money is in the truck. 

VICTORIA	You remember I speak French. Interesting.

MARCEL	I remember a lot of things. I remember your brother. He could speak lots of languages, like you. 

MARCEL	Like he could say a, “Fuck off” like in, I don’t know, dozens of different languages.   

VICTORIA	Cool story.

MARCEL	See where it took him. 

MARCEL	Your brother was a funny guy. 

MARCEL	Very charming. Very crooked too. You were a good team.

VICTORIA	Eh, you talk too much.

MARCEL	D you remember that delivery in Morocco?

VICTORIA	Yeah, you know, I don’t remember that.

MARCEL	You really don’t remember?

VICTORIA	Nope.

MARCEL	It didn’t go too well. You know you’re only alive because of your friend, Damon. And I’m gonna say that to the both of you. I could kill you right now. 

DAMON	It’s a trap. 

MARCEL	Your remains disappear. 

DAMON	Get out of there.

MARCEL	And what could he do about it? How much time does he have left to protect you? 

MARCEL	You and your daughter? 

DAMON	Get the hell out of there.

DAMON	Get out.

DAMON	Keep going.

ANN	You really fucked up my night.

KEHE	Get up.

KEHOE	Sit down.

KEHOE	Anything else, Governor?

ANN	Thanks.

ANN	Here it’s just water Drink it. I need to figure out whether you and Damon are in on this together. 

VICTORIA	In on what?

ANN	Well, nearly every enemy that you’ve ever had you’ve managed to eliminate in one night.

VICTORIA	Yeah, well I’m a good and my job and I’m a good shot. What’s your point?

ANN	Come on, Victoria. That’s not an accident. That’s been designed. 

VICTORIA	Ahhh, designed.

ANN	Clearly, yes, by Damon.

ANN	Why tonight?

VICTORIA	I, I, I don’t know.

ANN	Bullshit. He’s never asked for your help him before. And then tonight of all nights he chooses to clean house? What’s so special about this evening? Do you know that Damon’s been recording everything with his partners Rick and Childs?

VICTORIA	Ahhhhh, that doesn’ make any sense because Childs try, tried to kill Damon. 

ANN	Of course. He got cold feet. And tried to come over to our side. Damon was planning to turn the tapes over to the FBI. But we’ve taken care of that. And we’ll be taking care of Damontoo. 

VICTORIA	You can’t hurt Damon.

ANN	Uh, I’d be more concerned about myself if I were you.

VICTORIA	I am thinking of myself. Look, Damon has my daughter. And if something happens to him I will not know what he did with her.

ANN	Hmmm, I have a lucrative position to offer you. We want you to come over to our side. Find out where your daughter is and then go get rid of Damon. We’ll also give your daughter all the medical attention she needs. The best doctors in the world. The ones you can’t afford. Yeah, we know all about that too. This is for you, not Damon. He’s not gonna be able to spend it where he’s going. Take care of us, we’ll take care of you. I need to know right now. Are you in or are you out?

VICTORIA	What are you asking me to do. 

ANN	I want you to kill the mother fucker. 

VICTORIA	Shit. I’m gonna need a car. Oh and ah, my guns back and that sweet Whiskey you had before.

ANN	Very smart.

KEHOE	So?

VICTORIA	So what, Baby Boy.

KEHOE	Governor Driscol?

KEHOE	Oh shit!

VICTORIA 	HI

LILY	Hi mom.

VICTORIA	Get ready honey, we’re leaving.

VICTORIA	They’re coming for you.

DAMON	That’s the idea. This is all behind you now. The money is yours. All of it.

VICTORIA	What do you mean? You’re coming with me.

DAMON	No, no, I have to stay here. A few loose ends I have to wrap up.

VICTORIA	I can do that.

DAMON	No, no, this is something I have to do, for myself.

VICTORIA	Why?

DAMON	I’ve had enough.

DAMON	Now go.

DAMON	You have to make her well.

VICTORIA	I liked my plan better.

VICTORIA	Thank you

LILY	Wow, cool car mom!
