STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...
STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!
STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends, really Useful around the World!

STORYTELLER	Thomas visits Monument Valley, America.
STORYTELLER	Thomas was happily travelling the American State of Arizona. 
 
STORYTELLER	He was travelling very quickly...a bit too quickly. 

STORYTELLER	Then there was trouble!

STORYTELLER	Poor Thomas had slid too far from the tracks to be lifted back onto them.
STORYTELLER	But fortunately Thomas was soon on his way again...

STORYTELLER	...by road!

STORYTELLER	And that’s when Thomas saw something really incredible.

STORYTELLER	“Wow!” said Thomas. “Look at those rocks!” “That’s called Monument Valley” said the truck driver.

STORYTELLER	Thomas was thrilled! There were no railway lines for miles around. So he was very lucky to be travelling by road...

STORYTELLER	...or so he thought. Because then there was trouble again!

STORYTELLER	“Sorry, Thomas,” said the Truck Driver. “It looks like we are going to be stranded for the night, unless someone comes to help.”

STORYTELLER	“Fizzling fireboxes,” said Thomas.

STORYTELLER	“Wait a minute, that’s it! My firebox!”
	
STORYTELLER	Clever Thomas sent some smoke signals! And before long...

STORYTELLER	...help was on its way!

STORYTELLER	...a helicopter through the sky! Pulls out to the road to reveal a rescue vehicle racing along the road with a red and blue light flashing!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was pleased to have had a ride on a truck. And when Thomas was back onto the rails...

STORYTELLER	...the Truck Driver was glad to take a ride on the Number  Blue Engine!

STORYTELLER	“Yee-haw!”
