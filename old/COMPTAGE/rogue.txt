PATA	They told me it's this building.

ELIJAH	What do you want us to do, boss?

SAM	It's gotta be that one, eh?

ELIJAH	It's gotta be. That's a lot of open ground to clear.

TJ	Copy you. Inbound.

ELIJAH	Whoa, whoa, what about the others?

SAM	They're not part of the plan.

BARASA	Sam!

SAM	You just said we gotta move. They'll just slow us down. We don't have room in the vehicles. Rogue One for Rogue Three.

ELIJAH	Sam!

ELIJAH	It's gonna be okay. Alright?

SAM	I want you to cover your ears and open your mouth.

PATA	Boss! We've got company.

ELIJA	We need to move!

ELIJAH	Incoming RPG! Osprey, pull up. Pull up, Osprey!

SAM	Fuck! Fuck!

ELIJAH	Fuck you!

NURU	Stay with me. It's not that bad. It's gonna be--

PATA	Let me see. Oh, yeah, they shot him.

SAM	Joey! Calm these girls the fuck down!

JOEY	Hey! What's your name?

CHLOE	Chloe.

JOEY	Chloe? Oh, that's a beautiful name. Now look. I know you're scared; I know you're scared, but you need to calm down for all of us. The cavalry's, uh, well, the cavalry's gonna come back.

BARASA	Bobbie! Elijah! Take over! Fuck!

ELIJAH	I got this! Keep firing! Just keep them off us.

BO	Grenade out!

SAM	Joey. Grenade! It's hot.

JOEY	Thank you. See you later, assholes!

TJ	These wheels are done. Fuck!

SAM	Alright. We gotta move.

TJ	Out! Out! Out!

SAM	Move! Go! Go! Go!

JOEY	Come with me, come with me.

ELIJAH	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Down! Down, down. Ah, shit!

BO	It's high. We got to jump.

ELIJAH	Looks good to me.

BO	Move!

ELIJAH	We'll have to jump.

TESSA	What? No, we can't! No, we can't! It's not deep enough.

ELIJAH	It's deep enough.

TESSA	Oh, my god! That's no way of telling!

SAM	Hey! Do you want to take a fucking stand here? Because we're gonna die.

JOEY	Come on, come on, come on! There you go.

PATA	This is my last one! We need a plan!

JOEY	Hey, boss! What's the plan?

ELIJAH	Sam? What are we doing? What are we doing?

SAM	Take out your plates. Get rid of your longs. Anything that's gonna drag you down. We've to jump!

BARASA	There's no way! We're losing our longs? Losing our armor? It's fucking Easter!

JOEY	Hey, you know, we stay here, we're gonna die, right?

TESSA	No, I can't jump, please! Please!

BARASA	You think we wanna die from jumpin' off a cliff? Fucking nuts!

JOEY	I'm not gettin' paid enough for this shit! Killing bad guys is one thing, losing that shit--

SAM	Listen to me—

ASILIA	I can't swim.

SAM	Hey, hey, you can do anything that you need to do to survive. You've already survived this far. Look at this, this jump, it's nothing, It's nothing, it's just air. That river, it's nothing. It's just water. You can do this, we're gonna be okay.

TJ	I'm out!

PATA	Masakh! Masakh!

ELIJAH	What are you doing? Get down! Get down! Not here, my friend.

PATA	That man, he needs to die!

ELIJAH	Take your revenge another time.

JOEY	We've got to move!

SAM	Pata! Now! Move!

ELIJAH	Listen to me...

JOEY	Move!

SAM	Let's go! Pata! Let's move now! Asilia, we've gotta move. Move!

BO	Anyone want to go for a swim? Get your bikini! Go! Go!

ASILIA	No, no, no. I don't want to go.

ELIJAH	Come on!

ASILIA	No, no, no! We're gonna die!

ELIJAH	Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's fine. Come on. Trust me. Touchdown!

JOEY	You ready? On me. Move!

TJ	On me!

JOEY	TJ! No! Dammit! Shit. Come here. Come here. Come here.

SAM	Hey, I need you to get pressure on the wound. TJ, put pressure on the wound.

ELIJAH	Bo! I'm out!

BO	Go!

TJ	I'm done.

SAM	No. No!

TJ	Just go!

SAM	You know what they're gonna do to a woman.

TJ	They'll have me. Don't worry, I'll be dead before they get me.

SAM	Moving!

JOEY	Let's swim!

TJ	Go company!


BARASA	Where are the girls? Where are the girls?

JOEY	I've got you. I've got you. I've got you.

ZALAAM	Shit!

PATA	Hold on! Give me your hand!

JOEY	Stay down, stay down! Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

TESSA	I am so cold.

SAM	Come on, you gotta get up.

JOEY	Come on. Come on.

SAM	We gotta go. We need to move that far. Come on! We gotta keep moving. We gotta go. Come on.

JOEY	Come on. Try.

SAM	We gotta keep moving, come on! Let's go. Barasa, on your feet. Let's keep heading down the river. Two clicks.

BARASA	You're still in command?

SAM	Yeah, you better fucking believe that I am.

BARASA	Even after your fucking mess? I guess we'll see how much longer that lasts.

ELIJAH	Hey, hey. Another word out of your mouth, we've got a problem.

BARASA	We already got a fucking problem!

CHLOE	We need to rest. We need a break. Please! Please, we need a fucking break.

BARASA	Come on.

CHLOE	We need to rest. I can't do it.

BARASA	Take one hand.

CHLOE	You don't know what we've been through!

ELIJAH	Get in the fucking water!

CHLOE	I'm not getting in the fucking water!

ELIJAH	If you don't get in the water, you're gonna fucking die!


JOEY	You're wasting your ammo! Stop it!

SAM	Stop! Stop! Stop!

PATA	Everybody, move back! Move! Move. We need to move back. There might be a new animal.

BARASA	We have to do something, Sam.

SAM	She's dead. You're wasting ammo. Mike, Mike... they're gonna hear us. Come on. Move out!

FIGHTER	Zalaam, brother, help me.

ZALAAM	You're dying, my brother.

FIGHTER	No... 

ZALAAM	Yes. It's okay. This is your time. Do you remember Hillah? Huh? And all our brothers that were slaughtered at that day? Huh? Do you remember the ground? It was covered in blood, huh? And we'd say, it's as if the Earth was somehow crying for them. Do you remember that? For it wasn't crying out of sadness, they were crying out of joy. They are the lucky ones. They are the chosen ones, to have died that day. And now, you are the chosen one now. I love you, my brother. No more suffering.


ELIJAH	It's like a guard post.

JOEY	From what?

SAM	Here, you guys sit down.

JOEY	Guys, we got buildings up there.

SAM	Why don't you two go check it out?

JOEY	Oh, yippie! It's all right. I need Bo.

BO	Let's go.

PATA	It's going to be a poacher's moon tonight. Bad for us.

BARASA	Why is that?

PATA	It's a full moon, my friend. Abundant light in the night, there fore we are easy to see, easy to hunt.

TESSA	Hunt? Really?

PATA	You think Zalaam is gonna give up so easily? She's the governor's daughter. With her in his hand, Zalaam is wielding much power. And he will not stop until he has the entire government on their knees—

BARASA	Hey, stop, bro. That's enough. That's enough.

PATA	I'm sorry. No, we are well, going to be safe here.

JOEY	Hey, this is the last time.

BO	Last time you said, "This was the last time."

JOEY	Yeah, but this time, it's really the last time.

BO	Mm.

JOEY	That was a shit sandwich back there. Tell me you don't think she fucked up, huh?

BO	The plan was to rescue one girl. We rescue three. Different plan. Different outcome.

JOEY	Yeah. I think I know what this place is, it's like a farm. What do you think they kept here?

BO	I don't know.

JOEY	Let me know when you got an opinion.

BO	Well, you'll be the first to know. This looks like home.

JOEY	Yeah. Let's knock.

BO	Yeah.

JOEY	It's clear.

SAM	Yeah. It's good. Well done.

ELIJAH	Job well done.

ASILIA	Shouldn't we ask the--? 

PATA	Sit down.

ASILIA	Shouldn't we ask the owner's permission?

BO	We looked. No one here.

JOEY	Finders keepers, right?

BO	Mm.

ASILIA	Where do you think they went?

SAM	We're gonna find out. Eli, are you good?

ELIJAH	Always.

SAM	You guys get cleaned up. Joey, take care of that.

ELIJAH	The shit just hit the fan.

SAM	Good time to go sober.

ELIJAH	Never a good time.

SAM	Pata, Barasa, I want you on watch. Keep on comms.

BARASA	Copy you.

ASILIA	Wait, wait. So-- we just wait here until they come again?

SAM	We're far ahead. They're not gonna be able to track us. We're gonna find a way to call for help.

ASILIA	What about the sat phone?

ELIJAH	It's fucked. Bullet went right through it. I guess they don't make these seven-six-two proof.

JOEY	You got the receipt?

ASILIA	Well, don't you guys have radios?

ELIJAH	These are just for us. Not enough range.

ASILIA	Oh. Okay.

ELIJAH	Don't worry. We got this.

SAM	You guys get some rest. You two on me.

BARASA	Oh, shit. Fucking things. Waterlogged. Any one of you got polaroids?

BO	Don't look at me, huh?

PATA	Chinaman. 

ELIJAH	You okay?

SAM	Yeah. Are you?

ELIJAH	Yeah.

SAM	Good. You two check the parameter. If you hear or see anything, check in.

BARASA	Copy you.

JOEY	Radio check.

SAM	Good check.

BARASA	Good check.

BO	Thanks, Joey.

JOEY	Can you grab my med kit?

BO	Yeah.

JOEY	All right.

BO	Thank you.

JOEY	Ooh. Who's hungry?

TESSA	I am. What's that?

BO	Energy bar.

TESSA	Oh, okay. Better than nothing. Don't eat it all at once, huh.

BO	Okay, slowly, slowly.

TESSA	Oh.

BO	Joey.

JOEY	Hey, thanks, brother.

TESSA	It's so good, but so gross.

JOEY	Oh, yeah.

BO	Hm-mm.

JOEY	Like cup noodles. Mm.

ASILIA	Can I help you?

JOEY	It's not the first time.

ASILIA	What, that you've been shot?

JOEY	Yeah, shot, stabbed, beaten.

BO	And that was before he joined the Marines.

JOEY	No, it's right there.

TESSA	So, why is she in charge? Sam or whatever her name is?

JOEY	Oh, you should ask her. Her dad's the governor. He employed her.

TESSA	And so, she employs you guys?

JOEY	Yeah. It's okay. I got it. I got it.

TESSA	You're just in this for the money.

JOEY	What, do you want me to fight for free?

TESSA	Why not? Zealots and believers do.

JOEY	And ain't they just the loveliest people.

TESSA	So, if she didn't pay you, we'd still be in those fucking cages?

ASILIA	Tessa, don't. They're trying to help us.

TESSA	Yeah, I know. I mean, this is just a job to them. She's just a boss, and they don't even fucking like her.

BO	Who likes their boss, huh?

TESSA	Yeah, but you don't think that she can do this, do you? I just think that--

ASILIA	Is she good?

JOEY	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's good. She's been in The Suck, and she's been in some gnarly places, and she came out forged hard. Maybe too hard.

ASILIA	That she will... get us out of here?

SAM	Yes. Fuck. There's no power.

ELIJAH	The whole camp doesn't have power. The generator must be off. Tsk.

SAM	Okay, we find the gennie, get it started, and get this kit back online. Call for an extraction.

ELIJAH	Sounds like a plan. If we can find the gennie here.

BARASA	Huh. Back in business, bro. I wonder where everyone went.

PATA	There are many abandoned farms and villages here. So, when Al-Shabaab came, many people ran away. Others were killed.

BARASA	Are you from here?

PATA	I am Maasai, yes. So this whole area was my home.

BARASA	When did you move?

PATA	I didn't. I stayed.

BARASA	You're actually saying you joined them.

PATA	I stayed. I believed everything the imam was saying. I was a young person. What?

BARASA	That's why you knew that big tosser back at the cliff.

PATA	Masakh. You see that man? I'm telling you, one day, I will kill him. For all of my sins and his.

BARASA	We've all done bad things, bro. That's how we end up here.

SAM	What do you think is that big?

ELIJAH	It's big rats.

ELIJAH	Big, big, big rats. Ooh. Look at this mess. Blood in the backyard too. What do you think?

SAM	I think the driver was cut up and dragged out.

ELIJAH	Yeah. It looks like it.

SAM	This one's left running. Like they were trying to get away when they were hit.

ELIJAH	By what?

SAM	I don't know. Big rats.

SAM	This place just... feels wrong.

ELIJAH	Oh, so we're doing feelings now?

SAM	Yeah, I got feelings.

ELIJAH	I know you do. What I'm saying is that I don't think it's a bad idea if you just show it, you know, just-just every now and then.

SAM	Oh, yeah? What good is that gonna do?

ELIJAH	Makes you human, Sam. It'll help you keep your team in line.

SAM	My team is getting paid to be in line.

ELIJAH	Not the ones that don't make it home. Hey, Sam. I got your back. Always.

SAM	On three.

ELIJAH	Three.

SAM	What the fuck is this?

ELIJAH	Just what I thought... A lion farm. Poachers' stronghold.

SAM	A lion farm? Why would you farm lions? You can't eat 'em.

ELIJAH	No, but their skin... and these bones crushed up, it's worth a lot of money in the East. Fuck.

SAM	I thought that was tigers.

ELIJAH	Tigers started becoming rare, so they turned to lions. Now the lions are becoming rare. The difference is, they breed really well in captivity. So, we have lion farms. All the big males are shut in canned lion hunting farms. Some rich, fucking lazy, thickhead comes here with a hundred thousand dollars. Shoots the animals, flies back. He's got a nice big head he can put on his wall. And a story about how brave he was to kill the king of the jungle. These animals have never known freedom. Where they put them out, that's where they die.

SAM	That's fucked up.

ELIJAH	It is fucked up.

SAM	This is fucked up. Looks like maybe the lions got their own back.

ELIJAH	Good.

SAM	What do you think, like--?

ELIJAH	Hmm.

SAM	I don't know. Maybe two days?

ELIJAH	Hmm, huh. I don't know. I don't know. I can't tell in this heat. The generator went down, the lions dug themselves out.

SAM	Okay, and where did they go?

ELIJAH	Back to the bush, eh. No reason for them to stay here.

SAM	Good luck to them.

ELIJAH	They said when I was a little boy...

SAM	Oh, here we go; another 'when I was a little boy' story. I can't wait.

ELIJAH	No, no, no. This is a good one. When I was a little boy, I used to dream about being chased by lions. And no matter how fast or how high I jumped—

BARASA	Hey, Boss. This place looks deserted. You got anything?

SAM	Yeah. We got a couple of ripe bodies. It's pretty gnarly.

BARASA	Copy you. Got few more details that need to be checked out. Stand by.

SAM	Elijah? Elijah? Elijah? Elijah! Elijah. Elijah. Elijah. 

JOEY	What's that?

TESSA	What are they shooting at?! I can't see anything.

BO	Get down! Get down!

JOEY	Get down! Get down! Shhh.

BO	Get down. Stay down.

TESSA	Okay, okay. What do you see?

BO	Stay down. Get down.

JOEY	You'll be quiet.

TESSA	Please. Okay. 

JOEY	Shh. Hey, Bo. You stay with them, okay?

BO	No. You stay. You're more injured.

JOEY	This? Hey, be my guest.

BO	You supposed to argue more.

JOEY	Nah, we're good.

TESSA	No, no.

SAM	Jesus!

PATA	What happened? What happened?

SAM	Something took Elijah.

BARASA	What do you mean, something? 

PATA	Is he dead?

SAM	Yes. He's fucking dead. He--he's torn to pieces.

BO	Bo Yinn, what would your mother say, huh? She'd say... Oh, shit! Oh.

JOEY	Shit. Stay here. Don't move! Don't move!

TESSA	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

JOEY	Bo! Bo!

BO	Lion...

JOEY	Bo Yinn.

BO	A lion. I got it. It's injured.

JOEY	Yeah, good job. You okay, good buddy? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. He got you too a little bit, huh? Okay.

BO	Yeah. He got me too. Just a little bit.

BARASA	What happened here?

JOEY	A fucking lion got him.

SAM	Shit. One killed Elijah too.


JOEY	Elijah's dead?

BARASA	Ah, we got you.

SAM	Okay, get his weapon off. Get his weapon off immediately.

BO	No, no.

BARASA	There you go. There you go.

SAM	Okay. He's got lacerations all of the left side.

JOEY	Give him that morphine, give him that morphine.

SAM	We need that up here.

ASILIA	What happened to him? Someone talk to me!

PATA	Come on, Bo.

JOEY	Okay.

SAM	Okay.

BARASA	Look at me. Look at me.

ASILIA	What happened to him?!

SAM	Give him the morphine while we talk. He needs the morphine. Get it.

ASILIA	What the fuck happened to him?

PATA	A lion!

JOEY	I got him. I got him.

ASILIA	My God!

SAM	Come help. Help now.

BARASA	Hold on. This is gonna hurt, buddy.

PATA	A lion attacked him.

BARASA	There you go.

SAM	I need you to put pressure on this wound.

JOEY 	Hold on, man. Hold on, Bo.

TESSA	No, I don't wanna hurt him.

SAM	Put pressure on the wound, or he'll fucking die.

TESSA	Oh.

BARASA	I got it. I got it.

SAM	Press it down. Come on.

ASILIA	Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

TESSA	Come on. I got him. I got him.

PATA	Hold on, buddy.

TESSA	Oh, fuck.

JOEY	Come on.

SAM	Hey, Bo? Hey, hey...

BARASA	Hey, hey, hey. You stay with me.


SAM	Hey, stay with us! Stay there.

JOEY	Bo in the room, in the room.

SAM	Fuck. Fuck.

JOEY	Everybody...Yeah...

BARASA	Open up.

JOEY	Rock your body...yeah...yeah...

SAM	What the fuck?

JOEY	Everybody, rock your body right. Backstreet's back all right!

BO	You're right, it is very annoying. Really annoying.

JOEY	It's very annoying.

MAN	Boss, boss, I picked up their trail.

ZALAAM	Yeah?

MAN 	Five miles, south.

ZALAAM	Well done, brother. Let's go!

FIGHTER	Come on. Come on!

SAM	Joey, mate.

BARASA	I gave him all the morphine we had. The bleeding has stopped, but he needs an extraction.

PATA	We all need an extraction.

SAM	Right. So, we have to get comms up. All right. So, this is us. There's a VHF radio in this building that has no power. I didn't see a generator but you gotta assume there is one. Oh, you also gotta assume it's out of gas. So... we're gonna identify the generator, gas it up, get the power on, get the radio working.

JOEY	All before our friends come back.

BARASA	Lion friends, or terrorist friends?

JOEY	Grindr friends.

SAM	Look, I think we can do this. I know we've all been through a lot worse.

BARASA	Right. Not without ammo, fucking weapons, or some backup.

SAM	There's a first time for everything.

PATA	What does that mean? There's many places a lion can hide here.

BARASA	And why is the fucking thing still here? Seriously, why isn't it out with its fucking fuzzy friends out there?

PATA	Because some lions go rogue. They like to kill.

SAM	So, we're at the bottom of the food chain. What's the deal with the ammo? What have we got left? That's nothing. Jesus.

PATA	Shooting her won't help anyway. This caliber. This, it's not going to stop her. It might annoy her, but she will kill you first.

SAM	How do you know it's a 'she'?

PATA	Because females are the true killers.

SAM	Okay. What about, uh, what about fire? They're afraid of fire, right? Can we make that work?

PATA	Truth with lions, actually, they're not afraid of fire. In fact, it might even attract them.

JOEY	Makes you wonder how the fuck we got out of Africa in the first place, huh?

BARASA	How do you know so much about lions?

PATA	I'm Maasai. My people live alongside lions for generations. Hunting them is a tradition. Passage into manhood. In fact, a boy has to kill a lion in order to be a man.

JOEY	So, you've killed one?

PATA	No, I didn't. I couldn't. I just couldn't. I couldn't take life in order to prove some kind of ideal of manhood. I-I shamed my family.


SAM	Hey, I, I think that the ability to kill is the least quality that it takes to be a man.

BARASA	So, what do you do when something tries to kill you?

SAM	I guess we'll find out. You ready?

JOEY	Yeah.

SAM	Barasa, you see anything?

BARASA	My man's in position, Boss. Stand by. Okay. Where's this fucking thing?

SAM	I'm going to go check out these buildings over here. You got our six.

PATA	Copy. Sam, Sam, don't run, do not act like prey.

SAM	We are prey.

JOEY	This is just a walk in the woods.

SAM	I hate the woods.

BARASA	I've got ya. It's all clear, boss.

SAM	Copy.

BARASA	Pata. Eyes on you. You hold there.

PATA	Okay, copying you.

BARASA	Wait! Stop, stop, stop! The lioness. It's right there. Ten O' clock. Keep still. Don't move. Fucking things!

SAM	Got something here. Where is she?

BARASA	Bear with me, boss. Technical fault.

SAM	Okay, okay. Not prey. Barasa, can you see her?

BARASA	Okay, okay, just give me a second.

JOEY	We go back?

SAM	Need to have that radio, Joey. Barasa, anything?

BARASA	Okay, stand by! Fuck! We lost her, boss.

SAM	Start walking. Get me eyes on her. Copy?

BARASA	Stand by, boss! Fucking equipment failure. Nothing, boss.

SAM	Okay. I'll go east, you go west. Oh, yes! Wow! Fuck. Shit! Oh, shit! Joey, found the generator but there's no fuel.

JOEY	I can fix that. I found the fuel.

SAM	Bring it to me.

JOEY	Yeah, comin' now.

BARASA	Fucking things! Shit! Fucking things!



SAM	Thank you.

JOEY	There! Alright. Oh, my gosh! C'mon! Yeah, that's it.

BARASA	Back in business, boss!

JOEY	All right. C'mon, baby.

SAM	Great!

PATA	No! No, no. Boss... she got him. Barasa is gone.

JOEY	Shit! Copy!

PATA	Goodbye, my friend.

SAM	Station One, this is Rogue Team, over. Station One, this is Rogue Team, over.

STATION ONE	Rogue Team, go for Station One.

SAM	We lost the Osprey extraction, and in urgent need of assistance. We have the Governor's daughter plus one, she's a British national. We've an Al-Shabaab militia group in close proximity. We're out of ammo. We've multiple wounded; we have hostile animals near. We're in urgent need of extraction. How copy?

STATION ONE	Copy that. That's a negative on extraction. No asset free until dawn.

SAM	Negative. We're not gonna make it six hours. We need assistance now. Put Briggs on!

STATION	Roger that.

BRIGGS	Sam, this is Briggs. Sit-Rep?

SAM	We have the girl.

BRIGG	Good job. I'll let the Governor know. Heard you're having a little trouble?

SAM	We're not gonna make the night.

BRIGGS	You will. You always do, Sam. That's why I bring you on the tough jobs. Make it till dawn, and I promise you, I'll get you out of there.

SAM	Dawn. Copy. Out. Who's stupid fucking idea was this mission anyway?

JOEY	Uh, yours?

SAM	Oh, yeah. Help is coming! We just have to stay here a little while longer.

ASILIA	How much longer?

SAM	Till sunrise.

TESSA	What? We can't do that.

SAM	Yes, you can. Just a few more hours.

ASILIA	But Sam, they will come for us.

SAM	They won't. They don't know where you are. You're safe, it's fine.

PATA	We're not safe here. Zalaam does not give up. She is of value to them. She was not taken just for a ransom of money; she means they have power over her father. That gives him control over this entire region.

TESSA	You seem to know an awful lot about him. Why is that?

PATA	Because I was an Al-Shabaab soldier.

TESSA	I'm sorry. What the fuck?


SAM	Hey, look!

TESSA	You're one of them!

ASILIA	Does my father know that you've trusted the enemy?

JOEY	Your father knows a lot more than you think.

SAM	He is not the enemy.

ASILIA	What does that mean?

SAM	We couldn't have rescued you without Pata.

JOEY	I'll take this, okay.No bullets. We're out of ammo, remember?

TESSA	The men that took us are evil.

PATA	I'm not evil. I'm not like one of them. I would never be abducting little girls and be—

TESSA	Asilia, Asilia, show 'em. Oh, fucking Christ!

ASILIA	No!

TESSA	He needs to see. Look at this! They whipped her, and they beat her. Look at that! I don't know what your idea of evil is, but if you're with the kind of people that do that, then you're not coming out the other side as Mother fucking Theresa.


PATA	I was-I-I was young when I joined.

TESSA	So?

PATA	I tried to leave long ago. But they made it clear that if you leave, they will kill your children and your family. So, I stayed. Zalaam came from England; a man with many ideas, to teach us. To teach the people the ways of Allah.

TESSA	Jesus Christ, get to the fucking point!

PATA	I left. We escaped, okay, that is why I am here. But they came. And they did exactly what they said that they would do. My children... my family... all of them, you see. And they decided to-- to keep me alive, and they made me watch.

ASILIA	They came to our school... our class. They lined eight of us against the wall, told us to get down on our knees, bound our hands behind our backs, put bags over our heads. And he said, if we made a sound, he would shoot us. And we waited. We waited to die. Didn't make a sound. I waited my turn to die. We waited our turn to die. He killed them, when they could've just taken me. I never saw any hostages. Those hostages have names. We have names. What were your children's names? What were their names? What were their names?

PATA	I'm sorry. Boss, somebody needs to keep watch. I need to keep watch, boss.

ZALAAM	The others in position?

MASAKH	All in position. 

ZALAAM	Spread out. Come in from all sides. And remember, the girl lives. Everyone else, do as Allah commands. Go!

MASAKH	Go.

ZALAAM	It's about time we let them know we're here.

MASAKH	I think it is.

ZALAAM	You got the C4? Let's go, brother.

SAM	She's a good girl.

TESSA	Yeah. She cares about things. More than I do, anyway.

SAM	Are you guys friends?

TESSA	Hmm, not really. I mean, I hardly knew her before this little adventure.

SAM	Why are you in Africa?

TESSA	Just lucky, I guess. My parents' grand idea to help ground me was to send me to an expensive international school.

SAM	Wow! Count yourself lucky. I mean, my parents sent me to military academy when I was 13. I don't think I even left campus before I was 16. I went straight into basic training, and then right into the Ranger's Academy.

TESSA	So, no husband, kids, ten cats?

SAM	No, no, and no! Hmm. I live a moment away from death, either mine or someone else's, so I just don't really want to do that to another person, you know.

TESSA	Hmm. I mean, I figured you were just too much of a bitch for someone to handle.

SAM	Yeah, there is that. So, what are you gonna do when you get home?

TESSA	You think we're getting home?

SAM	Five more hours. Cakewalk.

PATA	He's here, he's here. Zalaam is here. He's coming.

SAM	Sit down. Hey, sit over there. Sit down. Sit now!

PATA	Okay, so, I spotted a scout over on the east side.

JOEY	Whoa! Whoa!

SAM	Hey!

JOEY	What are you doing, you crazy Chinaman?

BO	I heard there is a fight that I didn't want to miss out.

SAM	Okay, there is no ammo in this. You're gonna stay here with the girls.

BO	No. I can fight! Lemme fight! I can't just sit here.

SAM	That's exactly what you're gonna do. Sit the fuck down, right now!

BO	No!

JOEY	Captain's orders.

BO	She's not a captain. Are you? Are you a Captain?

SAM	You know I'm a fucking Captain, Bo.

BO	You're a girl.

JOEY	Whoa! Hey! That's just the morphine talking. Come here. Let's have a lie down here. Hey, Bo! There you go! If you feel the need to walk to that big bright light at the end of the tunnel, just remember...

BO	Everybody.

JOEY	Yeah, yeah, that's right.

BO	Everybody...

TESSA	Sam, what's the plan?

SAM	Sit down. Sit down!

TESSA	What's the plan?

SAM	Shut the fuck up! Sit down!

JOEY	Holy shit, boss! Good news.

SAM	Joey, what've you got?

JOEY	Boss, I found a Lee Enfield. It's got nine rounds. I figured we could shoot a couple of those fuckers, take their AK's, even the odds. Boo!

SAM	Oh! Hey! Get back. Hey! Hey! Hey! Me! Me!

JOEY	Run!

SAM	Look at me!

JOEY	Go! What the fuck you doing? What the fuck you doing?

SAM	Oh, fuck! 

ASILIA	Tessa! 

JOEY	Oh, fuck! Okay, now that doesn't work. That's right! Fuck you good, fuck you, pussycat! That's because I'm a fucking dark person, huh! Come here, kitty cat. Come on out! Give me the shot. Sam! Sam, you've got to move. You've got to draw it out so I can get a shot. Hey, kitty, kitty! Oh, shit!  Well, turns out Pata was right. They really were coming.

SAM	Jesus, Joey! That lion may have fucked you up.

JOEY	Yeah, I've had worse relationships. But those scars, they're, deep on the inside.

SAM	Can you see them? You good for this fight? Are you good to do this?

JOEY	Oh, yeah! Yeah, I gotta-got a little gas in the tank. No, not a whole lot, like lights on, you know, but it's not empty.

SAM	Good!

JOEY	Yeah, you want the gun?

SAM	No, no, I'm gonna figure something out.

SAM	You keep this. Let's go get the girls.

JOEY	Let's fucking go! Fuckers! Move!

SAM	Light 'em up.

JOEY	Keep moving, boss. Boss?

SAM	Moving!

JOEY	Move! Let's go.

SAM	Are you okay?

ASILIA	He's here. Zalaam's here?

SAM	Yeah, looks like it. Where's Tessa?

ASILIA	She was-- I thought she was behind me. We have to find her.

SAM	Yes, I'm going to. You have to stay here, and you do not fucking move until I tell you, do you understand? DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

ASILIA	Yes!

SAM	Joey! Joey, Joey, I've got Asilia. She's in the comms room. Do you have eyes on the other one?

JOEY	That's a negative, boss. I'll keep my eyes open.

SAM	Thank you. Out!

JOEY	Okay! Okay! Oh, that's quite heavy.

TESSA	Shit! No! No! 

FIGHTER 1	No need to take you alive.

SAM	Come on, grab on! Let's go!

TESSA	Oh, Sam!



SAM	Run! Back! Uh, no, no, no. Come on. Get down.

JOEY	Ooh, no. They'll get me. Uh, they missed. There you are, you son of a bitch. Okay. Ah-uh. Fuck, I'm good.

FIGHTER	He's shot.

MASAKH	Go, go, go, go, go. Follow me!

TESSA	Okay.

SAM	Okay, when I say go, you're gonna run to the comms room, right there where Asilia is. Okay?

TESSA	I don't wanna leave you.

SAM	You can do it. You can go, all right? I'm gonna cover you. Okay? When I say go...

TESSA	Okay, okay. Yeah.

SAM	Ready? Go!

TESSA	Fine!

ZALAAM	Hold on! Wait, wait, wait...

SAM	Shit. Stupid move. Fuck it.

JOEY	All right. Now, we got an even fight.

TESSA	Asilia! Are you okay?

ASILIA	Where's Sam?

TESSA	She's coming.

ASILIA	Get the door. Get the door.

TESSA	Okay. You want help?

ASILIA	Wait.

TESSA	What? Ah!

ASILIA	Wait! We can't always scream like babies. Wait, if we're gonna stay here. We will die. I mean, yeah, we have to fight.

TESSA	You wanna fight?

ASILIA	I've never fought back in my entire life, but I wanna fucking fight.

TESSA	Okay.

ASILIA	You ready? Okay, sshhh. Okay.

PATA	Hey, boss. I've got you. Here, take this.

SAM	Moving.

PATA	Covering!

TESSA	There's no one else I'd have rather been kidnapped with.

ASILIA	That's why I gotta be there for you.

TESSA	I'm scared.

ASILIA	Me too. Me too. Let's do this. Okay, let's go. Shit! Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, oh...  Oh...  Oh, oh!

FIGHTER	You are Zalaam prisoner? Quiet now!

ASILIA	No! No!

FIGHTER	Let go!

PATA	Masakh. Masakh!

MASAKH	Pata! My brother! You're still breathing, ah? And you grow some balls. Come. Come! Come again.

PATA	Shaa-uh!

MASAKH	Ahh? Ha-ha-ha. Come on, man. Ha?

PATA	Ahhh!

MASAKH	Huh? Coward! Where was your bravery before when you stood by and watched your family die, huh? Huh!

PATA	Oh-uhh-ohhh! Uhh... Oh... 

MASAKH	Huh?

PATA	Ahhh-ahh-ahh!

MASAKH	Huh? Okay.

PATA	Ahhh-ahh-ahh!

MASAKH	Okay? Huh? We let you live. We let you live.

PATA	This is no life!

MASAKH	Ahhh. Ahh.

SAM	Stay down.

MASAKH	Ahh.

PATA	Look at me. Look at me. You took everything away from me at the tip of your gun! My children's names were Tabu... Josie... and Sarah. Ahh! Now... Now, I am a man. Go! This is a good death!

SAM	You did good, brother. Your family would be proud.

PATA	Ahhh

JOEY	Oh, hey, Bo.

BO	My brother.

JOEY	Why don't you pull up a chair?

BO	Oh-oh-oh-oh...

JOEY		I clipped a guy over-over there. He dropped his AK. You got the strength to go over there and get it? Yeah. Me neither.

BO	She's out there.

JOEY	Uh, the lion? No. No... With the fire and the-the fighting, no. There's no way she stayed. She just didn't have a reason. Unless she's just mean.

BO	It's justice if she takes us. Huh. The things we've done to this world... In there. So much death. These creatures we kill for what? Medicine? Magic charms? I don't understand how anyone would want these animals dead instead of alive. For a belief, a thousand years old. I am ashamed. Oh, hi, boys. Hmm.

JOEY	(singing) Am I everything you need?  You better rock your body And... 

JOEY AND BO	(singing together) Everybody Yeah Rock your body Yeah Everybody Rock your body right-- Wow. Wow. Well, that happened.

JOEY	Huh. But you were right. She is still out there. You rest well, you crazy Chinaman.

ZALAAM 	What's going on?

TESSA	Fuck-fuck you! You!

ZALAAM	Come here. 

TESSA	Shit. Fuck! 

ZALAAM	Fuck! Shit! Shoulda known you'd be a handful when we first got you. Fucking Midlands girl, right?

TESSA	Fuck you! Murderer! Traitor!

ZALAAM	I'm not a murderer any more than your government's a murderer.

TESSA	Your government too, dickhead!

ZALAAM	Huh. Not anymore. It's not my country. It never wouldn't have been in the first place for anyone of my skin color or religion. I don't get to go back home. At least, I'm welcome here.

TESSA	Because of what you've done!

ZALAAM	I haven't even started yet.

TESSA	Oh, no, no, no, no.

ZALAAM	Get up! Get up!

TESSA	No!

ZALAAM	Girl, get up! 

TESSA	Shit! No, no, no, you...

ZALAAM	Shut your mouth!

JOEY	Ahh. Ahh. Hey, baby. Uh, uh, oh.

ZALAAM	No, no, no, no, no!

SAM	Let her go. Hey! Hey! She's not the one that you want.

ZALAAM	You're not the one I want, either. So, now, fuck it. I think I might cut her head off.

TESSA	No-ho-ho!

ZALAAM	You're so...

SAM	Tess, Tess. Hey. Hold still. It's gonna be okay.

ZALAAM	Why the fuck would you say that? You know it's not gonna be.

TESSA	Oh, huh?

ZALAAM	Shut the fuck up!

TESSA	Oh-oh-oh.

SAM	Here. Take me. Okay?

ZALAAM	Are you stupid or something? I told you, I want the governor's daughter. Now, I know you know where she is. So, bring her to me. Now, if you don't, you're all gonna die anyway. Including this one. Your choice!

TESSA	Sam! He's gonna do it.

ZALAAM	Yeah.

SAM	Okay, I'll give her to you. Just call off your men and you let her go.

ZALAAM	Yeah. Two lives for one.

SAM	I'll go find her.

ZALAAM	Hurry the fuck up!

TESSA	Fuck!

ZALAAM	Get down on the floor!

TESSA	Fuck. 

ZALAAM	We wait.

SAM	Asilia? Asilia? Hey. Hey, Asilia. I fucking told you to stay in—

ASILIA	I killed a man. I killed—

SAM	Yes.

ASILIA	I fucking...

SAM	Okay.

ASILIA	I killed a man.

SAM	Yes. I know it's hard, just-we can finish this. But I need you to listen. I need you to be strong. I have a plan, okay?

ASILIA	Where is she?

SAM	This way, come on.

JOEY	Uh. Uh. Fuck me.

ZALAAM	Well? Where is she?

SAM	She's in the barn. You can take her easily. That way, she won't know that it was me.

ZALAAM	Why do you care so much about what she thinks of you?

SAM	Because I promised her, I would keep her safe.

ZALAAM	Yeah? Well, you lied. Now, lead the way. Go!

SAM	Tessa, come on.

ZALAAM	Come on!

TESSA	Oh.

SAM	Why is she so valuable to you, anyway? Her father's never gonna give you power.  It doesn't matter what you do to her.

ZALAAM	I want what's owed to me.

SAM	Okay, so what about the Caliphate?

ZALAAM	Caliphate? There is no Caliphate. It's about what it's always about. It's about money. Her father stole-- don't look at me! Her father stole from me! He owes me.

SAM	Okay. So, this was all an act.

ZALAAM	Would you prefer if I was some zealot? That's for fools, man. Her father deals in the exact same ivory trade as we do. Lioness parts, rhino horns. Even this place, he owns it. It's part of his business-- breeding lions to shoot for profit.

SAM	No. Her father's a conservationist.

ZALAAM	Oh, yeah, of course, he is. It's a great cover story, innit? The fact is, everything has a value. Animals, humans. He has the highest kill count in the whole of the country, and he plays dirty, but don't worry. I can play dirty too, you get me?

SAM	Yeah, okay. She's in there. I told her to hide. You can just go in and make it look like you found her.

ZALAAM	Are you trying to tell me something ridiculous, or what? You think I'm dumb going in there alone? You first.

SAM	Let Tess go. You don't need her.

ZALAAM	Go on. Get out of here.

SAM	Go.

ZALAAM	Lead the way.

SAM	You can come out now, Asilia.

ZALAAM	So? Where is she?

SAM	Run now. Now.

JOEY	Hey, girls. Look what I found.

ZALAAM	What, you think that scares me? I told you I'm fucking badman out here. I've got the gun. I've got the power.

SAM	Actually, I don't think either of us do. So, now, you have a choice. Which bitch is gonna kill you? I swear one of us will.

ZALAAM	Well, then, you die first.

SAM	All hail the queen.

JOEY	Put it down, Tess. Put it down. Oh, oh. Go. Yeah, go, go, go.

SAM	My God. All she wanted was to protect her cubs.

ASILIA	Huh.

SAM	That's why she stayed behind when the rest of them left.

ASILIA	She reminds me of someone I know.

JOEY	Hey, what am I? Chopped liver?

TESSA	Hey, you did okay? I mean, for a guy.

JOEY	Yeah, yeah.

TESSA	Or did you want a hug?

JOEY	No, no.

TESSA	Come on. Maybe, you do.

JOEY	Oh, oh. I got issues, oh. Oh. Hoo. Oh, that hurt. Ow.

(FIN)
