 AMANDA	So is this how it’s gonna be? Every time we have a row, you run away.

ISSIE	I miss Dad.

ISSIE	I have these dreams, about a ship.

NANNY RUTH	There was a shipwreck, only one girl survived.

CALEB	I’m gay.

ISSIE	You haven’t told anyone else?

CAROLINE	I’m supposed to be your best friend, how could you tell her first?

SAM	I still haven’t received details of the expansion plans.

IC	He doesn’t know yet?

JULIA	He doesn’t need to know.

NATASHA	It looks like a borehole, where someone’s drilled.

ISSIE	That’s why they left, the noise of the drilling.  We’re gonna start a campaign to stop Hexronn.

CAROLINE	We need a killer website.

NATASHA	You have no proof Hexronn has done anything illegal, you have no idea what you’ve just done.

CAROLINE	How’s Coco today?

STELLA	Difficult, I mean, typical Coco.

CAROLINE	You’re like two outlawed cops who are forced to work together.

STELLA	What?

CAROLINE	You know, in the films, where the lazy cop that eats donuts all day has to work with the really uptight cop, and they hate each other.

STELLA	So, what am I? The donut cop?

CAROLINE	I don’t know, what do you think Issie?

ISSIE	I think our parents are gonna kill us if they see that website.

STELLA	Yeah.

CAROLINE	Well, hopefully they won’t.

AMANDA	‘We hate Hexronn’? Really Issie?

ISSIE	Oh, kay.

AMANDA	Honestly, what are you thinking?

CAROLINE	Oh, that would have been a better name for our site.  ‘Wat-er you thinking?’ Get it? Sorry.

AMANDA	I work for these people. Are you trying to ruin my life?

ISSIE	They’re the ruiners! They’re creating an environmental disaster zone.

AMANDA	You have to take that website down.

ISSIE	I know, we’re doing it.

AMANDA	Well do it quicker.

JULIA	This website must be taken down.

SAM	Look, it’s just kids messing around.  I’ll have a word.

JULIA	This sort of thing can be incredibly damaging.  There can be financial implications for all of us.

SAM	Look.

JULIA	Are your friends aware they’re spreading fake news?

NATASHA	Those things are real.

SAM	Natasha, for goodness sake.

NATASHA	But the swim hole, it’s polluted.

JULIA	That’s a, a temporary glitch.

NATASHA	And what about the borehole in the forest?

JULIA	We need to find a primary new water source for the expansion, and, this is looking very positive.

SAM	I’m sorry, what?

JULIA	I was gonna tell you when I had something more concrete to discuss, but, might as well be now.

SAM	But, people around here get pretty heated when you mess with the forest.

JULIA	Well that’s something we need to manage. Call a meeting, with the community, let’s put this to bed before it snowballs into hysteria.  I know your friends think they’re being good little eco-warriors, but the lies they’re spreading, they’ll cost jobs, destroy lives.

NATASHA	I tried to stop them putting it up.

JULIA	Ah. Do you know the pass codes?

DAN	So we’ve really got everyone’s backs up, aye?

ISSIE	Yeah, but we just need more proof, that’s all.

CALEB	Guys. I just went to take our site down, but it’s gone.

CAROLINE	Woah. Do you think Hexronn did it?

STELLA	We’re in trouble.

DAN	Yeah, with a massive, multi-national, billion-dollar company.  Good.

ISSIE	Yeah, but, don’t you see, the fact that they’ve taken it down means they’ve got something to hide. We’re totally on to them.

CAROLINE	Cool.

STELLA	Ok, so, no turning back now?

ISSIE	No way, we keep going.

CAROLINE	But, didn’t you tell your mum…

ISSIE	Whatever. I ain’t scared of her.

CALEB	I am.

CALEB	I don’t get it. They couldn’t have taken it down without the pass codes.

DAN	Well, it’s Hexronn, they’ve probably got hundreds of nerdy geeks working on it.  Oh, no offence.

CALEB	Some taken.

CALEB	But seriously, it is kind of weird.

DAN	Wow.  Ok.

CALEB	What?

DAN	They’re calling a community meeting, for tomorrow.

CALEB	Who, Hexronn?

DAN	Yeah.

CALEB	Probably just gonna feed us a bunch of lies.

DAN	Then we need to make sure they don’t get away with it.

CAROLINE	What do you think it means, Hexronn calling this meeting?

STELLA	Who knows? But I do not trust them.

ISSIE	Well, whatever it is, this is our opportunity to get heard.

DAN	Wow. You weren’t kidding.

MITCH	Morning kids, ready for battle?

STELLA	Wow, you look…

ISSIE	Like a nosebleed? Yeah, I told her.

MITCH	It’s the red of protest. It’s a symbol of the blood on their hands.

CALEB	You two have been busy. What does your mum think about all this?

MITCH	All those years I carted her round on my hip at Greenham Common, you think it would have rubbed off.

STELLA	Hex Wrong.  I love that.

MITCH	Thanks love.  Help yourselves kids.

CAROLINE	I heart Justin Bieber?

MITCH	Oh, sorry, I was gonna paint over that.  There’s a whole stack out there.

CALEB	Oh, I want that one.

CAROLINE	Me too.

CALEB	Oh, hey. Watch it. Look, how long are you gonna be in a mood with me? I said I was sorry.

CAROLINE	Yeah, well. Too little, too late. When you told Issie you were gay, you never gave me a second thought, did you?

CALEB	No, Caroline, for once, it wasn’t about you.

CAROLINE	Well, it was really hurtful.

CALEB	Look, I just didn’t want it blurted out to everyone.

CAROLINE	I wouldn’t blurt it out.

CALEB	Come on Caz, you know you’re a motor mouth, and you don’t think before you speak.

CAROLINE	Just get over yourself Caleb, it’s the ’s, no one cares if you’re…

CALEB	Caroline.

DAN	Hey, you guys ready to go?

CALEB	Yeah. Yeah. We’re coming.

CALEB	That’s what I’m talking about.

MITCH	So, I dressed up as a salmon and just lay down in the fountain.

DAN	And what happened?

MITCH	I got arrested.  But, they listened.

AMANDA	Mum, Issie. Do you even hear the words coming out of my mouth?

ISSIE	They took our website down, just like you wanted. They want to gag us, they know they’re in the wrong.

AMANDA	Or, maybe they took it down because it was libellous.

CALEB	What?

AMANDA	You can’t post lies about people, it can ruin reputations.

ISSIE	They’re not lies.

AMANDA	Issie, you keep pushing me, you keep testing the boundaries, well this, is the boundary kiddo.

ISSIE	Yeah, watch me walk all over it.

MITCH	That went well.

AMANDA	Oh, don’t, mum, don’t even, she’s winding me up on purpose, just like she did back in London.

MITCH	That kid’s had a lot to deal with Amanda, losing her Dad.

AMANDA	Yeah, well, it was hard for me too Mum.

MITCH	I know love.

CALEB	Sorry, I think I picked up the wrong sign.

MITCH	Come on, let’s go.

JULIA	Perhaps let me do the talking in there today.

SAM	But, I thought it was my job to win the people over.

JULIA	You’re having enough trouble keeping your own daughter in line right now.

SAM	Now, hold on. That website wasn’t Natasha’s doing.

JULIA	I know that, and you know, she seems like a good kid, but perhaps, easily led. Those friends of hers.

SAM	They were all good kids, until Issie arrived, she’s from London, so obviously she’s a bit more sophisticated than our lot, gave her mum a fair bit of trouble back home, now on the other side of the world it doesn’t look like much has changed.

JULIA	What sort of trouble?

KENNY	Well this is a stupendous turnout…

STELLA	Shouldn’t we be like, outside, chanting?

DAN	What would Greta do?

CALEB	Make an amazing speech, obviously.

DAN	Well do you have an amazing speech?

NATASHA	You guys are so embarrassing.

KENNY	Last time we were here, was the murder mystery fundraiser I think, again sorry about that, lost a bit of perspective that night.  Hopefully today, different scenario, little bit less dramatic, a lot more, water based.  And of course, who can deny the healing properties of water, I mean my wife Corinne, she has irritable bladder, cleared it right up.  Anyway, I’ll introduce to you…

KENNY	…crickey, you’re close, um, Julia.

JULIA	Kia ora everyone.

CROWD	Kia ora.

JULIA	My name’s Julia Allen and I’m thrilled to be here in your beautiful town.  Now, I understand that some of you have concerns, so, let me lay them.  If you refer to sub-clause three point two in our environmental impact statement…

MITCH	In English please.

TIPENE	Yeah, or Te Reo.

JULIA	Ok, in simple layman’s terms.

KENNY	Or laywoman.

JULIA	Ok, let’s just cut to the chase, you guys are important to Hexronn and I want you to feel like you’re all part of the Hexronn team too.

TIPENE	Oh yeah, so what about those pictures then?

DAN	Yeah, on our website.

JULIA	I am so glad you brought that up.

MITCH	I bet you are.

JULIA	I know that many of you have been alarmed by the small bore hole in the forest. We were testing for potential water sources.

TIPENE	Yeah, in our native forest, you’re kidding.

JULIA	But, as it turns out, the results were not promising.

NATASHA	Dad.

JULIA	So you have nothing to worry about. Sam, perhaps you’d like to say something.

SAM	Well, as Julia said, it was simply an avenue that we were exploring, really, but the forest is no longer under consideration.

TOM	Right, so if that’s true, why are you trying to buy out my land? Right next to the forest, my stables.

MITCH	And my cottage.

CORRINE	Yeah, a bit sus isn’t it?

STELLA	Yeah.

DAN	Yeah.

JULIA	Sure, sure, I can see what you’re thinking. But it is standard industry practice to buy properties that are in the radius of our plant, folks. Honestly, Hexronn is absolutely on your side, in fact, I’m thrilled to announce that we will be sponsoring your local rugby team.

JULIA	Which, I understand is on a winning streak.

MITCH	You have the blood of thousands on your hands.

JULIA	Ah, excuse me?

MITCH	Entire colonies of bees, devastated by your pollution.

MIRIAMA	Come on Mitch, Hexronn isn’t that bad.

JAKE	They’ve given us jobs, this town was being bypassed and left for dead.

KENNY	Now that’s a bit harsh, we’ve got a wonderfully vibrant choir.

MEMBER OF PUBLIC	And they’ve invested in the roads.

KENNY	Yeah, let’s hear it for Hexronn.

ISSIE	No. No. Don’t you get it, they’re not on our side. They took down our website, they don’t want you to see the polluted swim hole, and why are they hiding what they’re doing in the forest. They’ve driven the wild horses out of their home.

TOM	What wild horses?

ISSIE	The kauri point herd.
.
MIRIAMA	What, no they’re extinct.

ISSIE	No, they’re alive, they’ve been hiding in the forest for hundreds of years, and she is destroying their environment.

JULIA	It’s, ah, Issie, yes? Issie, from London. Hi, I am sorry, sweetie, that we haven’t considered your wild horses, but we only have the Loch Ness Monster and the Sasquatch on our protected bio vista profile.

ISSIE	No, they’re real. I know they are.

AMANDA	Issie, please.

JULIA	Oh, I can see that they are real, to you Issie, and I get it, but you see, you have woven a tapestry in your mind, kids do that under stress.

MITCH	She’s only stressed because of you and your cronies…

JULIA	Children will go off the rails when a parent dies. I’m so sorry about your Dad Issie.

AMANDA	How does she?

JULIA	It’s difficult, wasn’t it, you fell in with a bad group, went off the rails, and now your poor mum’s had to bring you all the way down here.

AMANDA	Stop talking.

JULIA	And you’re doing it again, aye. Girls like you will always find a way to make trouble.

AMANDA	You are way out of line.

JULIA	I know it’s hard to hear, but I will not have the delusions of one child effecting the whole community, and I’m sure that all of you as parents will feel the same.

AMANDA	I said, stop talking.

MITCH	Or I’ll come up there and stop you myself.

JULIA	I’m just providing context, that’s all.

MITCH	You’re a nasty piece of work.

DAN	Issie. Are you ok?

AMANDA	Issie, don’t do this. Please, wait, wait.

ISSIE	What did you say to her?

AMANDA	Nothing, I promise.  Sam and I were talking.

ISSIE	Sam?

AMANDA	About Natasha, about the divorce, about her mum moving away. She was struggling with her mum’s new family, so I mentioned your bad patch. But that you had come out of the other side of it.

ISSIE	What, you got me away from it by dragging me out here? See, you couldn’t even be honest with me about why we came here. It was because of me.

AMANDA	I was out of my depth, Issie, the climbing out of the window at night, staying with heaven knows who, or where, anywhere but home with me.

ISSIE	Because you didn’t want me there.

AMANDA	What?

ISSIE	You didn’t want me there because it’s my fault he died. I know it and you know it, Dad is dead because of me.

AMANDA	Ok, ah, that just crossed the border into crazy town.

ISSIE	And I’m crazy too, good to know.

AMANDA	No, but what you’re saying is a little, Issie, please don’t do this.

NATASHA	What was that all about in the meeting?

SAM	Yeah, I guess you must have been blindsided.

NATASHA	Duh, yes, she’s a liar Dad.

SAM	I know, when Amanda told me about that stuff in London, I should have seen it then, that kids like her are a bad influence.

NATASHA	No, not Issie, Julia. She told us the bore hole was going to be the new water source, and then lied to us at the meeting and so did you.

SAM	I think you’re getting confused with what we meant.

NATASHA	Dad, Hexronn is going to destroy Kauri Point, and you’re one of the bad guys.

SAM	That’s what I’m talking about. You and these kids winding each other up, it ends now. I’m moving Aramis.

NATASHA	What?

SAM	If you want to keep riding, that’s what’s gonna happen.

NATASHA	This is so messed up dad.

SAM	Like I said, that’s up to you, but you’re out of Kauri Point Stables.

MITCH	What was she talking about? Wild horses.

AMANDA	I should have gone after her.

MITCH	You keep pushing her Amanda, and you’ll end up pushing her away.

AMANDA	Oh, that’s profound.

MITCH	See, that’s exactly the kind of unhelpful energy I’m talking about.

AMANDA	What are you going to do, Mum? Wave sage over me?

MITCH	She’s hurt, she feel’s betrayed.

MITCH	Give those to me, you’re in no state to drive.

AMANDA	But we don’t know where she’s gone.

MITCH	Yes, we do.

ISSIE	People really suck, don’t they? But you get me, I think you’re the only one who does.

STELLA	I texted her, but nothing.

CAROLINE	Same. Natasha, what have you done?

NATASHA	It wasn’t me.

CALEB	Sheesh.

CAROLINE	How, how could you.

ISSIE	Once we were on holiday, in Tenerife, there was sand, black like this and Dad bought a magnet and he showed me how the iron makes it stick to it, all spiky like a sea urchin.

NATASHA	For the tenth time, why would I do it?

STELLA	For the tenth time, because you’re team Hexronn!

CALEB	Did you give them the pass codes to our website?

NATASHA	I, um…

CALEB	Natasha.

CAROLINE	You’ve always been on your dad’s side.

NATASHA	Well not anymore. He told me he’s moving me to another stables.

STELLA	What?

CAROLINE	Why?

NATASHA	Apparently, you’re all a bad influence.

CAROLINE	We are not.

STELLA	No way.

CALEB	That’s pretty cool.

CALEB	But also, yeah, how dare he?

NATASHA	Anyways, I don’t think it’s that at all, it’s because we’re getting too close to the truth.

CALEB	Come on Tasha, spill the tea.

AMANDA	I’ll talk to her.

MITCH	You’re not the one who needs to talk. You, my girl, you need to listen.

ISSIE	How did you find me?

AMANDA	I have Bear Grylls level tracking skills. And I went to the stables, Tom said you’d probably be here, he figured you’d want to be alone.

ISSIE	Yep. You’re kind of ruining that.

AMANDA	Oh, Issie, I’m sorry, when I told Sam about why I moved us here I never thought he’d tell anyone, let alone Julia. I guess I have extremely bad taste in men.

ISSIE	Except for dad.

AMANDA	Except for your dad. What did you mean when you said it was your fault?

ISSIE	You know how I got obsessed with that bubble game on my phone.

AMANDA	Yeah, you were a total screen junkie.

ISSIE	I had only got as high as bubble four, and then one night I was almost at bubble five.

AMANDA	Quite the achievement.

ISSIE	I was so close, and then I heard dad upstairs, he called out to me, I mean, I thought he just wanted me to do my homework, so I kept playing, I got to bubble eight, and I was so happy, can you believe it? Because of a stupid game, and I saw how late it was, and you still weren’t home from work, and so I went upstairs, and that was when I…

AMANDA	Oh, Issie. Love.

ISSIE	If I had just gone upstairs when he called.

AMANDA	It’s not your fault. The doctors said there was nothing anyone could have done. If I hadn’t had you there, you sweet, clever, brave, girl, with his eyes and his smile, you kept me going, and you still do. Your dad loved you, more than anything. It will kill him to think that you would blame yourself.

ISSIE	Bad choice of words mum.

AMANDA	Yeah, I don’t know, I mean he did, he did love a terrible dad joke.

ISSIE	Yeah, he invented dad jokes, right?

AMANDA	Yeah.

MITCH	You two look completely wrecked.

AMANDA	Thanks mum, commander of the USS Obvious once again.

ISSIE	Sorry Gran, I didn’t mean to worry you.

MITCH	Don’t be silly, love, worrying’s what we’re here for, isn’t it Amanda?

AMANDA	Yeah, except I’ve had enough of that for one day. I need a cup of tea and a lie down.

ISSIE	I just need to take Blaze back to the stables first. Don’t worry mum, I’m not gonna run away. Promise.

MITCH	Issie.

ISSIE	The ring, where did you find it?

MITCH	I was going to ask you the same thing.

ISSIE	It was in the jewellery box in my room, but, I lost it.

MITCH	Try to hang on to it this time. It may not be the crown jewels, but it has been in our family for over two hundred years. It belonged to Dora.

ISSIE	Dora?

MITCH	Your great, great, great, great, great, grandmother.

ISSIE	Woah, that’s way too old and special, I will definitely lose it.

MITCH	No you won’t.

TOM	You ok?

ISSIE	Yeah.

TOM	Your mum found you then?

ISSIE	Mmm hmm.

TOM	That’s good.

ISSIE	I know I shouldn’t have taken Blaze without checking with you.

TOM	No, just don’t make a habit of it aye. What you said at the meeting, another time aye. The kids are back there, tack room.

ISSIE	I’m so sorry.

NATASHA	See, I told you I didn’t do it.

ISSIE	Yeah, I kind of had a meltdown and took it out on…

CALEB	A map. So you got kicked out of London for this kind of thing? Ripping up maps and stuff.

ISSIE	Not exactly, but yeah, I kind of had an off the rails phase.

CAROLINE	So did Caleb.

DAN	Really?

CAROLINE	Yeah, when we were eight, mum made this big cake for our birthday, and he snuck in the night before and ate the whole thing and he like spewed everywhere, like all over the kitchen and… doesn’t matter.

CALEB	Yeah, so not exactly off the rails.

DAN	Anyway, welcome back London. We missed you, and your drama has already been upstaged.

STELLA	By Julia, who is evil.

DAN	And Natasha’s dad, who thinks we’re all a bad influence and he has to move Aramis to a new yard.

ISSIE	What?

NATASHA	Oh, don’t get too excited, I’m not leaving.

STELLA	Yeah, we’re gonna stop him, obviously.

CALEB	Because we’re whanau right? That means family.

ISSIE	Yeah, I kind of picked up on that.

DAN	Then you know that family, we stick together. No matter what.

ISSIE	You saved her, you saved Dora.
