MARTIN		Repeat - h?’s not...	

MARTIN		Red Star is down.	

MARTIN		I need backup.	
	
MARTIN		They have a payload.	

MARTIN		Where the fuck is my backup?
	
MARTIN		Olga... It’s me, it’s me!                                   

OLGA			Martin?                                                       

MARTIN		Are you ok?y? 

OLGA			Martin, what are you doing here?

MARTIN		You stay in a car, don’t move."	
	
RUSSIAN #2		??? ??? ?????.  Give me the bag. Throw me the bag."

RUSSIAN #2		??, ?????!  Come on, do it!"	
	
LISA 			Twenty minutes. You all set?"	

MARTIN 		Yeah, I’m good."	

MARTIN		The hell is that?                                        

LISA			Avocado salad, low-fat yoghurt. I’m detoxing.    

MARTIN		You’re detoxing... What for? You’re 12 years old.     

LISA		So amazing. You can clean out your whole body. It works on your mind and your feelings and your life. Everything changes for the better! It's so powerful, d'you know what I mean?	
	
LISA			Sorry, am I boring you?	

MARTIN		What did you say, sweetheart?..	

LISA			Never mind. Listen. This Richie May...	

LISA		He’s got the range, but you got the power. He’s really tricky… he’s gonna keep you dancing at the end of his jab so you need to use your legs... create space and bide your time. And when he gets tired, move in for the knockout.	

MARTIN		Lees. I wanna do what I always do, okay? I'm gonna walk him down."	
MARTIN		Smash straight through him.                                                             

LISA			I don’t think that would work, dad...                         

MARTIN		Don’t you worry about it, you leave it up to me. Ogh...	

LISA			You sure?                                                                        

MARTIN		Course I’m sure.	

MARTIN		Anyway. What is this? “Twenty Questions”? Go on!	
	
	
	
LISA			What are the odds on the next match?                                                                  

MAXIM		Bully Boy two point eight... Richie May one point nine.	

LISA		Two point eight for the Bull? You kidding me? Richie May won the last K-1 Grand Prix. He kicked the shit out of The Fly and almost choked Garry Newman.	

LISA			Bully Boy should be way over three.                                                     

MAXIM		Two point eight it is.	

LISA			What’s the minimum bet?                            

MAXIM		Fifty.                                                                 

LISA			Oh, you’re a real high roller, aren’t you? Here’s five hundred. 	

LISA			Richie May.	
	
LISA			Haymaker! Haymaker!	

LISA			 He’s got the range, use your legs!	
	
LISA			Dad!!!	
	
REFEREE		Can you fight? Can you fight? Look at me!"	Can you fight?" 				Look at me! Can you fight?                         

MARTIN		YES.

LISA			Come on. COME ON DAD! Come on!	
	
LISA			It’s time to stop!	

LISA			DAD!!!	
	
LISA			You alright?	
	
MAXIM		For the lady. Better luck next time, Bully Boy.	

MARTIN		What the fuck is that?	
	
MARTIN	 	You bet against me?	

LISA			I tried to warn you, but you were clearly not listening.	

MARTIN		How could you do that, ha?Ha?	

LISA			I don’t know what’s being up to you lately, you just not being focused.	
MARTIN		Lees! ... Lees!	

SUZANNE		Oh my God, I gotta see you.	
	
SUZANNE		Are you all right? I’m sorry, I didn’t meant to turn you on....                                                        

MARTIN		Just go, all right? Just go.                              

SUZANNE		Baby... Look, I’m sorry, I didn’t...                                                            

MARTIN		I just say fucking leave. Just go.                                                           

SUZANNE		All right. God.	
	
MARTIN		Ready?	
	
MARTIN		Do what I told you.                                                       

LISA			Dad, I’ve been thinking. You like it here, right?	

MARTIN		It’s all right.	

LISA		I’m tired of moving all the time. I think we should settle down here. Open a restaurant or something.	

LISA			What do you think?	
	
MARTIN	You know what I think, Lees. I think we should keep moving. You know? That’s what we do, right? Me and you. We’re a team.        	

LISA			But why?	

MARTIN		Look... You not concentrated, are you? Remember, what I said about aiming the gun?	

MARTIN		Use these gun sights to aim. Alright? You don’t look at the target, target's in the background. Blurry. You’re still aiming at it, but it's these. That’s what you use to focus. Yeah? Come on. You know what to do. Have another club.                                                         

LISA			I want to start school this fall.	

MARTIN		What?	
	
	
MARTIN		Lees, you’re not concentrated, aren’t you? Focus.	

LISA			Dad, I have to think about my future. I have to have a profession. 	
MARTIN		What, you want an office job? Come on. 	

LISA 			I’m not saying that. I could be like, a writer, or an artist.                                                                

MARTIN		Oh, yeah. That’s just what the world needs is another artist. Begging on the street for money. “Oh please, please pay me.”	

MARTIN		 “Pay me to express my innermost...”	

MARTIN		 “...thoughts”. I've always told you, Lees? To be independent.	

MARTIN		Don’t have to rely on anyone else.	

LISA	 		But to be independent I have to have skills.	

MARTIN		You got plenty of skills. I taught you everything you need to know.	
LISA			After this summer I’m starting school. That’s it.	
	
US ANNOUNCER 	Police are investigating the sudden illness of a Russian opposition activist named Sergei Skuratov. Skuratov and his wife were found... unconscious Sunday in New York’s Central... Park, after attending the international summit on regime evolution in Russia.                                                       

MARK RAMLEY	This is a major incident. We have determined that it was attempted murder by administration of the nerve agent. And we'll not...                                                              

MARTIN		Lees. I’m off to work. Lees! Off to work. Be back late, okay? I’ve put you a pizza in the oven.                                                                 

LISA		Frozen pizza again?! Do you ever listen to anything I say? I’m detoxing.	
MARTIN		Alright. Break it up, lads! BREAK! I said break..." it up!	
	
BOUNCER		Stop...	Okay, break it up... Getta fuck’ out of here. ...Mate. Fuck was that all about? You want the police to turn up here again?	

MARTIN		Sorry, I’m alright.	

BOUNCER		 Listen to me. Get your shit together. You hear me?	
	
MARTIN		Sorry, mate...	Okay... Next!                                                            

SASHA			That was quite an impressive display of anger management, Martin.	
MARTIN		Purse on a tray.	
	
SASHA			Did you know that anger is always preceded by feelings of pain?	

MARTIN		...you should probably mind your own business, don’t you, luv’?	

MARTIN		Next!                                                                     

SASHA			We are in the same business. We need to talk.	
	
MARTIN		You forgot this.	

MARTIN		I’d be more careful with my belongings if I was you, Ms. Stepanenko. 	
MARTIN		Interesting name. What is it?	

MARTIN		Russian?                                                             

SASHA		Ukrainian. You do remember my father Egor, don’t you? You worked with him. The Gazette? Kiev, twelve years ago? He told me you were the best investigative reporter he’d ever met.	

MARTIN		I think you might have me confused with somebody else."	

SASHA		This was taken on my father’s cellphone. It was taken just a few days before he died. My father his colleague Olga and this is you, right?	
MARTIN		How did you find me?	

SASHA			I’m a journalist, just like my dad.	

MARTIN		What do you want?	

SASHA			My father’s mission is mine now. Nothing has changed since he died.	
SASHA			Have you seen the latest news?	

MARTIN		Look, what happened to your father that was a tragedy...	

SASHA			I need your help to get the files.	
	
MARTIN		DOWN!	

MARTIN		Move!"	
	
MARTIN		Sasha?!	
	
TREVOR		Martin! You old fox."	

TREVOR 		Home at last. Been a long time, ha?"	

MARTIN		What's going on, Trevor? Old lady throwing you out again? Or CIA starting another war? "	

TRAVOR		Just craving a little chit-chat with an old buddy. Why don’t you sit down."	
	
MARTIN		So you found a beer?..	

EDWARDS		Pleased to meet you. John Edwards, MI6."	

EDWARDS		Heard a lot about you."	

MARTIN		You`re bleeding. "	

TREVOR		Oh, don`t worry. Nothing serious. Just a little... Intranasal tumor Comes and goes. Just can`t seem to find the time to schedule the surgery."	

MARTIN		I'd account to that if I was you. Can't be too careful. "	
	
MARTIN		Wanna tell me what you`re doing here in the middle of the night?

TREVOR		All righty. Let's get down to it. "	

TREVOR		We’re here because of your little tête-à-tête with that cute reporter. What exactly did you two discuss?

MARTIN 		I don`t know what to tell you, Trevor. I mean I'm a bouncer. You know - a part of the job description is you gotta talk to people."	

TREVOR		When you quit MI6 we had an agreement. You don’t mess with our business... we don`t mess with yours. I told you than...if you tried to get back in the game, I’d take you out."	
	
TREVOR		Now. Did she mention the files?"	

MARTIN		It`s twelve years ago, Trevor. Why the fuck you bring it up now? Ha You know what happened. The Russians got the files."	

MARTIN		Mission not accomplished.

TREVOR		Well, the reality turns out to be a bit more complicated than that."	
MARTIN		Please, enlighten me."	
	
EDWARDS		We're all worried about your health, Martin."	

MARTIN		What’s that supposed to mean?"	

EDWARDS	They will find you. The Hilton, yesterday morning. He was less fortunate than you.
	
MARTIN		Who was he?

EDWARDS		One of our chaps."	

EDWARDS		He got too close to her. They nabbed him by surprise.

TREVOR		The stakes have gone up, Martin."	

TREVOR		The Russians have repeatedly used nerve agent in the UK, but now they’ve done it on our turf as well. We consider this an act of war. Work with us Martin, we’ll protect you.  Otherwise... well, you could end up with a new smile, too."	

LISA			Dad?"	

MARTIN		Lees, back to bed, please."	

MARTIN		Back to bed...

TREVOR		Lisa!"	
	
TREVOR		Last time I saw you, you were wearing....a poopy diaper.

LISA			Can`t sleep...

MARTIN		You need to go back to bed, sweetheart, okay?

LISA			Uhu...

TREVOR		Some daughter...you get there. She’s grown up fast. Looks just like her mother.	

LISA			I look like myself.

TREVOR		Listen Martin, I get you don’t give a rat’s ass about the Russians. Fine. But you realize those files would probably expose the scumbag who betrayed us in Kiev?

EDWARDS		If we find the rat in our network...I promise you, he will face a firing squad."	

TREVOR		Don’t you want to know who’s responsible for her mother’s death?"	
LISA			My mother was in an accident.

TREVOR		An accident?

MARTIN		Trevor...

LISA			A car accident."	

TREVOR		You didn’t tell her?"	

LISA			Tell me!

MARTIN		Right, that’s enough."	

MARTIN		Get out. Lees!"	

TREVOR		Think about the traitor, Martin. Wouldn’t you just love to encourage his disappearance?

MARTIN		Trevor... I told you before, I'm out. Now, fuck off!

TREVOR		Very well. If there's ever anything you’d like to share with me, you know where to find me. Good seeing you again, Martin. Good seeing you..."	

MARTIN		I'm sorry, Lees. I was gonna tell you...

LISA			Go away. 

MARTIN		Please, honey, just... will you listen to me, please?

LISA			You lied to me.

MARTIN		I was gonna tell you when you're older.

LISA			Go away. Leave me alone. 

MARTIN		Please, honey, just...
LISA			You lied to me."	
	
OLGA			Promise me it will always be like this. Promise...

MARTIN		I promise. I promise.

OLGA			I don't believe you."	
	
US ANNOUNCER	...with a military-grade nerve agent of a type...Russia has developed in the past. It's one of a group of nerve agents...known as Novichok."

US PRESIDENT		Military toxicologists have concluded that the Kremlin was most likely.... responsible for this heinous act of terrorism...

MARTIN		Lees, pack your stuff please."

US PRESIDENT 	...on American soil."

LISA			What?"	

MARTIN		We're leaving. "	

LISA			Why do we have to leave? Dad?

MARTIN		Just do as I say, okay?

LISA			I don't want to leave. I want to stay here. Why it's always about..."	
MARTIN		I have no time to argue with you. Just pack your stuff."	
	
TATYANA		???? ???! Bring him here! Wonderful. Perfect profile for a secret agent. "	
	
MARTIN		Alright, slow down. Just slow down, okay? You… Whatever you wanna know..."	

TATYANA		I want the files."	

MARTIN		What files? What are you talking about? What files? Fuck!"	
	
TATYANA		Where does she hide them?

MARTIN		You got the fucking files!"	

MARTIN 		I saw the guy take the shoulder bag with my own fucking eyes. "	
	
MARTIN		You got the files. No no no WOW wow!.."	
	
	
MARTIN		Fuck!"	

TATYANA		Maybe this...refreshes your memory."	
	
MARTIN		Okay, okay... Sasha knows where files are. I can get them for you."	
MARTIN		She thinks I’m a journalist. I used to work with her father. You know that, right? "	

MARTIN		I can get you the files."	

TATYANA		You will get them.

MARTIN		Yes!"	
		
FSB GENERAL		????? ? ???????????. 24 ????. The files... and the reporter, 24 hours."	

TATYANA		I want the files and the reporter. Dead....or alive, I don't care. You’ve got 24 hours."	
	
Olga (V.O.)		You will get her out. You promise me?"
	
TATYANA		Lisa! Your father is collecting a present for me. If you are nice, we will be..nice. You can order all candy, chips, soda you want, okay?"	

LISA		I want a berry smoothie. Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and two cups of spinach."	

TATYANA		??????? ??... Bring her..."...??????? ?????. ...a berry smoothie. Do you like cartoons?"	
	
ADR 			He's just parked at Shaftesbury Ave, Soho. Maxi Million club.	
	
	
EDWARDS		(into his mike) He’s in."	

TREVOR		(into his mike) Go check it out."	
	
MARTIN		When I tell you I’m out... that means I’m out." Hey, mate."	

BARMAN		Hey.

MARTIN		Maxim around?

BARMAN		Who’s asking?"	

MARTIN		Tell him Bully Boy needs to see him."	
	
MAXIM		Wow. Bully Boy."	

MAXIM		Have..."	

MAXIM		...a seat."	
	
MAXIM		Cognac?"	

MARTIN		I'm good."	

MAXIM		So?"	

MAXIM		What brings you down here in the middle of the night?"	

MARTIN		Are we okay to talk business?"	

MAXIM		Yeah, sure. Go ahead."	

MARTIN		I gonna fight coming up with this Armenian guy."	

MARTIN		And a funny thing is that the Russians are talking about the Armenian guy kicking the bucket during the bout."	

MAXIM		Bucket kicking? Like, you mean die?"	

MARTIN 		Apparently the girl is mixed up in this as well. Ukrainian girl, blond hair, phoenix tattoo on her neck. Says she’s a journalist."	

MARTIN		Know anything about that?

MAXIM		Why should I know about her?"	

MARTIN		Cause I found this. In her wallet."	
	
MAXIM		So?"	

MARTIN		So this is about the time you quit the bullshit, Maxim, don't you? Where is she? "	

MAXIM		I don’t like your tone, Bully Boy."	
	
MARTIN		Seat down."	

MARTIN		Calm down."	

MAXIM		How the fuck did you get that here?"	

MARTIN		Came to see you, didn’t she? That’s how she found me."	

MAXIM		You are a dead man walking."	

MARTIN		Take your phone out."	

MARTIN		Get your fucking phone out."	

MARTIN		I'm not gonna ask you again. Do it."	
	
LISA		Look at that. He’s in close and he can’t get..a punch in, so he ties up his opponent’s arms and pushes him back at the same time.  See how he’s pushing. Spence back onto the ropes? A lot of fighters get uncomfortable in that situation, especially Shawn Spence."	
	
	
TATYANA		So you think this Smokin’ Joe will win?

LISA			Oh, yeah."	

LISA		I’d put cash on it, 70 to 30 odds, at least. There he goes. Owww...That hurt! What did I tell you. Wish I’d put money on that."	

TATYANA		You put money?"	
	
MARTIN		I'm here to help you."	
	
MARTIN		Your father was my friend. I won't let the same thing happen to you. Give me your phone."	

SASHA			Why?"	

MARTIN		How do you think I found you? Take this. It's safe. Do you know what			we're up against, right?

SASHA			They don’t scare me. I want those files published."	

MARTIN		To avenge your father’s death?"	

SASHA		Yes. And all the others. I found his log book. The last entry was about a meeting with a woman he called Red Star. Red Star had collected evidence...of a chemical weapons program. She had gotten hold of the formula for Novichok. She even had samples of it."

MARTIN		Your father didn’t tell me that."	

SASHA		Red Star thought it was too risky to bring the files to the meeting, so she put them in a bank.

MARTIN		She put them in a bank...

SASHA			Yes.

MARTIN		Where is this bank, Sasha?"	

SASHA		I’m the only one who knows. The address of the bank was in his log book. I burned it.	
	
MARTIN		Shit. Very smart.

SASHA			I need your help to get the code."	
	
BURNS			For fuck’s sake... taking a nap while on duty?"	
	
MARTIN		Let it ring. Turn around, don't you look at me. Let me see your hands."	
CIA IT TECH		Who are you?

MARTIN		Don't you worry about that. Log in to the CIA system."	

CIA IT TECH		This... I'm... We're just a trading company....don't know what you think, but...

MARTIN		If you don't want me to blow your brains out all over this nice monitor, do what you're told. Wow-wow-wow. What are you doing? What are you doing? No, I know your game."	

MARTIN		You got a real password and a fake one, yeah?  Let me suggest some thing. Put the real one in. Okay. Operation ""Red Star"". I wanna see everything you've got. More... Keep going. Twelve years ago, Kiev. Okay, scroll down. Down, down. Keep going. Okay.  Alright, stop. This hand-written note. Yellow hand-written note. Yeah?	

SASHA			A van just pulled up outside. Men with guns. Get out of there."
	
CIA IT TECH		It’s encrypted. I don’t have.....access."	

MARTIN		Print it. Everything. Print it or not?!"

CIA IT TECH		Yeah, it's coming."	
MARTIN		Come on. Get up. Move. Where’s the escape route?

CIA IT TECH		The what?

MARTIN		The fucking escape route?

CIA IT TECH		On the back wall.

MARTIN		Show it. Where is it?"	
	
TREVOR		Martin! What's going on? Martin? Let's talk about this, shall we? If you have a gun, just put it down. We don't want anyone getting hurt. You hear me? Martin? Martin, I'm coming in. Two! Down! Lets go.
	
BURNS			Game over, mate. Slowly up.
	
TREVOR		Jig's up, Martin."	
	
TREVOR		One on him.

SASHA			What took you so long?

MARTIN		Drive.
	
FSB GENERAL		?????? 10 ?????. - 10 hours have passed." ?????? ?? ????. - Put up the pressure."	

TATYANA		??, ? ??? ???????. - Yes, i will comply.	
	
SASHA			You’re telling me MI6, CIA, they’re all after us?	

MARTIN		It's not even our main concern.	
	
SASHA			You’re not like any reporter...I’ve ever met.	

MARTIN		That's cause I'm the best, right? Isn’t that.... what your father said? Fuck!"	

SASHA			What’s wrong?

MARTIN		They've changed the encryption.	
	
TREVOR		Martin, you're surrounded. Come out with your hands above your head. Final warning, Martin.	Good. Very good. Now move forward. Slowly.	
	
	
SASHA			Tell your men to put their guns down.	
	
SASHA			The files you’re looking for...	

SASHA		...are in a bank. Martin has the code to the vault in his head. He’s the only one who knows it. Now you tell me: shall I blow his brains out?"	
TREVOR		That would just break my heart, dear Sasha."	

SASHA			Am I?

MARTIN		For chrissake, Trevor!"	
	
SASHA			Tell them to put their guns down, now!

TREVOR		Come on, please.	

SASHA 			I'm the only one...	

SASHA			...who knows the location of the files.	

TREVOR		Calm down.

SASHA			Three...	

TREVOR		You’re bluffing.	

SASHA			Two...

MARTIN		Sasha... Sasha... What are you doing?	
	
SASHA			One!

TREVOR		Okay, okay.
	
MARTIN		I told you, he wants those files more than anything."
	
TREVOR		Wake up! What did he want?	

SASHA			You guys seem....to know each other pretty well.

MARTIN		Who?

SASHA			Don’t play games with me, Martin. You know who I’m talking about."	
CIA IT TECH 		He said it was a handwritten note. Yellow paper. Could only print the encrypted version.	

MARTIN		I'm sure you got a lot of questions, Sasha, but you just have to trust me, okay?

TREVOR		When was the encryption last updated?

CIA IT TECH		Six months ago.

TREVOR		Good, then he doesn’t have what he was looking for."	

MARTIN		Look, believe me, I'm as scared as you are.

SASHA			I'm not scared.

TREVOR		Did anyone ever follow up on this?

CIA IT TECH		Yeah, but the number is not registered to any network.	
	
MARTIN		Hey, mate! Fancy joyride.	

TREVOR		That’s no phone number...

TREVOR		...it’s the fucking code of the vault. Print it out.	

SASHA			What do we do now?

MARTIN		Got a credit card?

SASHA			Yes.

MARTIN		Get it out. Time to set a trap.	
	
TREVOR		Give me status.	

BURNS			He's close. We've lost him.
	
MARTIN		Oh, sorry! Excuse me. Sorry, I really wasn't looking what way I was going, was I?... Sorry. It's British. Gonna be alright with that?	
	
CIA IT TECH		We got a hit. Sasha just booked two tickets to Moscow. To hotel in the city center. I’ll make some calls.

TREVOR		Don't.....bother. They’re not going to Moscow. He’s not that stupid. Check all outbound...flights from every airport within a hundred mile radius for a passenger named Sasha Stepanenko. Chech the trains, too.

CIA IT TECH		What about Martin?
TREVOR		You seriously think he’d travel under his own name? Give me all the security camera footage from every airport in London. 
	
LISA 			That’s pretty.  Is it really yours? Your bracelet.	
	
US PRESIDENT		It is now clear that Sergei Skuratov and his wife Yulia were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent of a type Russia....has developed in the past. It’s one of a group of nerve agents known as Novichok. 

TATYANA		I hope you have a good news for me?

MARTIN		I know where the files are. I'm gonna need more time.

TATYANA		Listen, if you’re trying to trick me...you will not win. You understand me?"	

MARTIN		Nobody's trying to trick anyone here, okay? the files are in Kiev. Sasha is taking me there now. We're close. I just need a little more time. "	
TATYANA		How do I know this is true?

MARTIN		Look, do you want the files or not? Now let me talk to Lees.

TATYANA		Say hello to your father.

LISA			Dad?

MARTIN		Sweetheart. You alright? How are you doing?	

LISA			Okay, I guess. I’m having a pedicure. When will you come?

TATYANA		That’s enough.

LISA			I want to speak to him more! He misses me.	

TATYANA		I sure he does.

LISA		You have no children, do you? If you were a mother, you wouldn’t do this.

TATYANA		You think you know me?

LISA			If you had kids, I bet they’d hate you.	

TATYANA		You think you are an intelligent girl, right? Good. Let me tell you a story, about your father and your mother. You know what he did?" Your father told her he was a journalist...He pretended to love her, but he was really a spy. So, my question is, intelligent girl: what are you for him? Accident, maybe? Or maybe you are good for cover...

LISA			You don’t know shit. I was born out of love. He told me.

TATYANA		Okay, we are finished. We can’t be late for the fight."	

BURNS			Bingo. They’re on a fly to Kiev."

MARTIN		Something wrong?

SASHA			I haven’t been here since he died."	
	
RUSSIAN AMBA	We ended our chemical weapons program in 1992. We eliminated all the chemical weapons that existed in Russia."

SASHA			Martin, look.

RUSSIAN AMBA	But at the same time we'll be very suspicious of everything that’s happened around this occasion against Russia. And naturally we want to know the truth.

MARTIN		The Russians' position in this case is becoming increasingly bizarre. You know what the next step is...?	

MARTIN		Then they start blaming the Americans. 

SASHA			You remind me of my father.	
	
MARTIN		Your father was a very brave man. Very stubborn. Little bit like you.	
SASHA			Why did you leave Kiev?	

MARTIN		I lost someone too.	

SASHA			A woman? She died?	
	
OLGA		Never get personally involved during a mission, Martin. That leads to failure, remember? We don’t want that."
	
TATYANA		You were right. He won with a knock-out in the third round. How do you know that?

LISA			What happened to my mother?	

TATYANA		Forget about that.	

LISA			No, tell me. I want to know.	

TATYANA		I can’t tell you. You should ask your father."	

LISA			Tell me.	

TATYANA		Your mother was in a dangerous situation. Your father tried to save her, but...	

TATYANA		She got hit.

LISA			Hit?

TATYANA		By a bullet.

LISA			Who did it ?

TREVOR		Well well well, you're getting predictable, buddy. Martin - you're getting predictable, buddy

MARTIN		Put the gun on her and shoot her if you have to.

SASHA			Get inside.	
	
MARTIN		Nice of you to bring it in person, Trevor.

MARTIN		Punch in a code. I know you got it on you.

TREVOR		You give me too much credit. "	

MARTIN		You want me to fill you up?

TREVOR		What is it, Martin? Quick trade with the Russians? Little revenge on your former employer?  What?

MARTIN		Just do it.

TREVOR		Your new girlfriend she recruited you to the People’s Cause? Cosy little bedtime publishing deal?

MARTIN		Look, enough of your bullshit. Just open it. "	
	
TREVOR		I wouldn't do it, if I were you. What if it set is a trap? Think about it. Red Star was FSB. What if she wants to fuck us over? Stop! There’s Novichok inside.	

MARTIN		Sasha We good? Hands up, back up. All the way down the hallway. Do it or I fucking kill him. "	
	
TREVOR 		You just signed your own death warrant, man. Agency's gonna have a hard on for you. 

MARTIN  		I don't think so, do ya?. I'll take my chances. 

TREVOR 		Hey, Sasha. You trust this guy? Like your father did? You know, twelve years ago..."	
	
SASHA			This looks bad.

MARTIN		It’s a scratch. Bullet went straight through. I was lucky.

SASHA			Ukrainian medicine, best there is. This might sting a bit, but you’re 			a big boy, right?	
	
MARTIN		Sasha, what are you doing?

SASHA			You’re one of them.

MARTIN		I can explain.

SASHA			Don’t move. I swear I’ll shoot you.

MARTIN		If you shoot me, you gonna kill my daughter, too. The Russians have got her."	
	
SASHA			Don`t move. You’re full of shit."	

MARTIN		It’s the truth. Listen... I need those files, okay. My daughter`s life depends on it. And now... I know you want to expose the people that killed your father. And I get that. I really do. But is the ends justify the means?"	

SASHA			You seriously think I believe you?"	

MARTIN		Just ask yourself this, okay? Would your father have sacrificed the life of a little girl..?

SASHA			You don`t know shit about my father!"	
	
OLGA		Never get personally involved during the mission Martin. You WILL get her out. Remember, you promised me? We don`t want that. You promise me? That leads to failure. Martin. That leads to failure. Remember? Failure. We don't want that. Failure. Never get personally involved during the mission. We don't -volved- failure. You will get her out. We don't want... Promise me?

LISA		She makes me soup for lunch. Borscht? It’s pretty good. I bought her a TV." And a laptop. 

MARTIN		Yeah?..

LISA		Her daughter Marina lives in Moldavia they can now talk online to each other. Marina’s really sweet.	

MARTIN		Hang on a second. You bought her a TV and a laptop?	

MARTIN		Where’d you get that kind of money?

LISA			I earned it.

MARTIN		You earned it..?

LISA		Well, that Russian lady, she was kinda weird. She was crazy about gambling but she didn’t know anything about boxing. So I offered my services.  Fifty-fifty.

MARTIN		You partnered up with her?

LISA		Yeah. I ran the numbers and she put up the money. And we won... a lot, actually.

MARTIN		You always were the cleverest. Come here.	I've missed you.	

LISA			Dad...

MARTIN		Yeah...

LISA		She told me what really happened to Mum. She said you tried to save her. It was an accident.	

MARTIN		I just didn't know. I had to tell you that. I didn't want you to hate me.	
LISA			It's okay, dad, it's okay.

TREVOR		Taxi for Boryspil Airport. Get me out of this godforsaken place.	
	
TREVOR		Lisa? You alright?	
	
LISA		Does the name look familiar? That’s just a copy. The original is in a safe place. If anything happens to me or my dad, it will be sent to all the right people. I know you'll find a way to get him out of here.
	
SASHA		Dear Lisa, I hope you’re doing fine and the foster mother takes good care of you. I will always be grateful to you for saving my life.  Inside this envelope, you will find the name of the double agent in the CIA - MI6 network. Please be careful. Remember, when you live among wolves, you must behave like one. Your friend, Sasha Stepanenko.	
UK ANNOUNCER	Online publication of the files in Russia has led to the biggest public protests in years. Sasha Stepanenko. You made these files public. The first response from the Kremlin is that the files are ‘fake news’. What is your response to that?"	

SASHA		If it’s fake news, then why don’t they permit inspections of the chemical weapons lab in central Russia? It’s like we’re back in communist times. The extermination program was focussing on opposition activists and journalists. Like my father."	

SASHA		But this isn’t just a Russian problem. The concept of objective truth is being threatened everywhere. It is really important that we, the international press, stand together, unified for free speech. If not, lies will be our history."	
	
MARTIN 		You're right, Lees?

LISA			Hi ya. 

MARTIN 		You hungry? 

LISA 			Yeah! 

MARTIN 		Yeah? So what about journalism? I mean it’s a pretty cool profession, isn’t it?  

LISA 		I don’t know, it’s mainly behind the desk. I mean at the end of the day you just gonna be stuck behind the computer, aren’t you? 

MARTIN 		Yeah But you do get to travel, get to meet people, things like that... 

LISA 			Travel? 

MARTIN 		Yeah. 

LISA 			What‘s the pay like? 

MARTIN 		Oh, come on Lees it’s not all about money, isn’t it? 

LISA 			I could cover boxing. 

MARTIN 		Yea, you could. And you could also cover... I don’t know... the National Ballet.  

LISA 			Oh...
	
MARTIN 		Kitchen is closed. We shut at eleven. We're opening again at s...
