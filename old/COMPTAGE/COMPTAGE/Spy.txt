(SPY KIDS: MISSION CRITICAL)

(EPISODE #101)
("Mission Critical")

INGRID	Gregorio Cortez.

GREGORIO	Ingrid -- what are you doing here? I thought you said you had book club tonight?

INGRID	And I thought you said you had bowling with the boys?

GREGORIO	Well -- since we’re both here let’s make a night of it, hmm?	They do say married couples with kids should go on more dates, you know.

INGRID	Well, not exactly dinner and a movie... but it’s better than nothing.

GREGORIO	I-it looks like some sort of top- secret cybernetics program.

INGRID	Give me a few seconds and we’ll have all the info we need.
INGRID	Aaand Done!	If we leave now we can probably catch a movie downtown.

GREGORIO	I am sorry, my dear, but it looks like our plans have been postponed.

INGRID	Are you kidding - this date night just got interesting.

GREGORIO	Let’s end this quickly... combination sixty-one: the “Aztec Death Spiral.” Reverse death spiral? No, Impossible?!?	That move is classified.

INGRID	Who are these guys?

GREGORIO 	“SWAMP.”I’ve never heard of them.

INGRID	Gregorio!

GREGORIO	Oh, no, the files!

GOON	To the transport! Mission is complete!

INGRID	We’re too late! 	We’re never too late?!? Gregorio -- who was that?

GREGORIO	Our worst nightmare.

CARMEN	Sorry, Mr. Breakfast Burrito.	I know we just met, but I need to eat you now. What the-- JUNI!!!GET YOUR OWN BURRITO!!! Oh, this is so on.

JUNI	Hi, Carmen. New toy?

CARMEN	Early middle-school graduation gift.One of the perks of having super spies for parents. And those?

JUNI	Zero-gravity boots. Built them myself in the lab this morning. One of the perks of living in a super spy facility.

CARMEN	Uh-huh.	My breakfast burrito—

JUNI	I think you mean MY breakfast burrito?

CARMEN	Hmm...I’ve got just the blob for the job. Aha! Got it! Strategy always wins over force.

JUNI	Huh - you might have a point...

CARMEN	Ugh.You are a vile little man.

JUNI	Correction - a vile little man with a burrito.

AGENT VOICE	It was like they knew our every move.

CARMEN	Shh - Did you hear that?	Sounds like secret spy stuff. Hey, dad.Everything ”okay”? Have you been up all night?

GREGORIO	O.S.S. agents all over the globe have been failing their missions because of a counter-spy agency calling themselves S.W.A.M.P.

CARMEN	Sinister Wrong-doers Against Mankind’s Preservation.

JUNI	Hm, Catchy.

GREGORIO	And all our agents said the same thing about their encounters.

MULTIPLE VOICES	It was like they knew our every move! They were always one step ahead of us!

GREGORIO	Your mother and I faced off against them last night. Everything the agents say is true.

JUNI	Wait -- I thought she had book club and you went bowling?

CARMEN	How is that possible? O.S.S. Operatives are the best spies in the world.	All your moves are classified.

GREGORIO	Unless they knew that information from the start.

CARMEN	But how--

GREGORIO	Several years ago I headed up a top- secret O.S.S. initiative called  “The Third Brain Program.” The goal of this program was to create artificial intelligence equivalent to the intelligence of our best spies. But the program was eventually disbanded when our experiments proved futile. And we disposed of all the “bad brains.” But there was one brain that could not be destroyed. A golden one. We took every precaution to lock Golden Brain safely away. But...


GOLDEN BRAIN	Greetings, Gregorio... or should I call you - “father”? Ech. Despite your best efforts to destroy me, I continued to grow on my own.	Yes, your wittle brain is all grown up, Gregorio.	As you can see, I escaped the flimsy containment unit that you constructed for me, built a cybernetic body for myself and assembled a new counter-spy organization with one goal in mind - taking over the world. But to do that, I must first destroy the ones that created me - the O.S.S.

JUNI		Holy Frankenstein’s monster, Dad- man.

GOLDEN BRAIN	Oh, and you are probably wondering how my men have been able to defeat you so easily when all your moves are classified.Well, technically as a former agent of the O.S.S. I still had access to all the operative files... which I have stolen.	That’s right. The big secrety secret agents can’t keep their own secrets safe. I know you better than you know yourselves. Well, ta-ta for now, Gregorio.	I look forward to our big reunion.

JUNI	But you’re gonna stop him... I mean, “it”... right, dad?

CARMEN	And what did he mean by “our big reunion”?

GREGORIO	SWAMP. Okay. Junito. Carmen. Find a safe hiding spot.	We will come back for you when this is all over.

JUNI/CARMEN	But--

GREGORIO	You heard me. Now go!

JUNI	We can’t just leave them out there, Carm. What can we do?

CARMEN	What we should do - we fight.

JUNI	I was really hoping you’d say that.

CARMEN	I got a read on them. Up ahead. But there’s a bunch of S.W.A.M.P. goons between us. We need to find a way around them.

JUNI	Uh-uh. Not the plan I had in mind, sis.


CARMEN	Juni!

JUNI	S.W.A.M.P.? Great name, you guys. Was “FART” or “BARF” already taken?

CARMEN	Um, can you stop being so reckless?

JUNI	You call it “reckless” - I call it “winning.”

CARMEN	Ugh. Little brothers.

INGRID	What do we do?

GREGORIO	Do not give up.

JUNI	Woohoo! Coming in hot! Come on, is that all you got?

CARMEN	Coming through! Are you done winning?

GREGORIO	Junito! Carmen!

JUNI	It’s Golden Brain!

GOLDEN BRAIN	Ha-Ha! The O.S.S. is no more!

CARMEN	Oh, no...

GREGORIO	I have no other choice but to scatter all agents to safe houses around the world until I can figure out a way to defeat Golden Brain. The agency has been exposed and we are all at risk. Golden Brain will stop at nothing until he finishes the job. I’m sorry, friends. Agent Cortez out.


CARMEN	Don’t worry, dad. You’ll come up with something. You always do.

GREGORIO	But how do we stop a villain that knows us better than we know ourselves? And we haven’t even begun to discuss this. You two are going to be grounded until your mid-forties. Of all the reckless, dangerous -- That’s it.

CARMEN	What is?

JUNI	Who cares -- he’s smiling. Maybe we won’t get grounded after all.

GREGORIO	I have a plan on how to stop Golden Brain and get the O.S.S. operational again.

CARMEN	Um, so how exactly is this the answer to defeating Golden Brain? Are we planning on giving all of S.W.A.M.P. food poisoning?

JUNI	Oh, no.This is even worse than I thought, Carmen.	We’re not grounded. He got us - jobs!

CARMEN	Dad, I know it was dumb for us to join the battle but this is a little extreme, don’t you think?

JUNI	You know there’s very strict child labor laws in this county...

GREGORIO	Follow me.


CARMEN	This is your fault.

JUNI	My fault?!? You were the one that was all “we fight.” Uh... this just took a turn for the creepy? You go first.

AUTOMATED VOICE	One mile.	Ten miles. Sixty miles. One-hundred-eighty miles. Destination.

JUNI	Not gonna lie -- you might want to back away. Taco Butte coming up.

CARMEN	What is this place?

GREGORIO	You will see. to O.S.S. Spy Academy.

JUNI/CARMEN	Whoaaaaa.


(END ACT ONE)


(ACT TWO)



CARMEN	So you and mom were trained here when you were teenagers?

INGRID	Yes, but this facility has been closed for many years.

GREGORIO	Closed until a few days ago -- when you gave me the idea to re-open it. No one knows about this place - not even Golden Brain.

CARMEN	We gave you the idea?

GREGORIO	Yes.If the past is our enemy, then the future might be our salvation.

JUNI	Not following.

INGRID	You were the only agents in the fight that Golden Brain's men weren't able to get a step on because there's no file on you.

CARMEN	Golden Brain knows every old operative, so the O.S.S...

GREGORIO	... must train new ones. So I have assembled the best teen spy cadets from around the globe to become the next generation of O.S.S. agents.

CARMEN	I knew you would figure it out, dad. You’re full of surprises.

GREGORIO	Yes. And I have one more. You will further your training here at the Academy while undertaking your most difficult mission yet - codename: MISSION CRITICAL. With the O.S.S. out of commission - time is of the essence. Golden Brain's forces are mounting. You are the only ones that can keep him in check. And bring SWAMP down.

CARMEN	Defeat an entire counter-spy organization by ourselves?

INGRID	No. You’ll need a team. And together you’ll find your team here among these new cadets.

JUNI/CARMEN	Wait -- OUR team?!?

INGRID	Yes.Mission Critical will be your team.	And you will lead it together.

CARMEN	TOGETHER? Him? ME?!?

JUNI	Nuh-uh. I work solo. Lone wolf.

GREGORIO	Ay, Nonsense. You’re born leaders. It’s in your blood. Mission Critical must work.For the future of mankind. Now, in the meantime, your mother and I are going into deep cover like the rest of the agents.	But we will not be far. Good luck. The entire world is counting on you.

JUNI	Well, I guess we should get to work then, huh?

CARMEN	Yeah.It would seem that we have a whole world to save.

JUNI	How hard could that be?

CARMEN	To defeat a villain like Golden Brain, Mission Critical has to be all about strategy.  Juni and Carmen closely observe classrooms and training sessions as cadets go about their daily activities.

JUNI	Nuh-uh. Mission Critical has to be all about kicking butt.

GLITCH	OMG. Totes love your jumpsuit. And your hair - adorbs! Selfie!!! The name’s Glitch.Techno- espionage, code-breaking, genius level I.Q. Incredible fashion sense. LOL. Hashtag full package - Am. I.Right? Just texted you all my info, set up our own private e- mail server, and got us access to every computer on the Earth. Besties for life!

CARMEN	Very promising.

JUNI	Wait -- you understood her?!?

CARMEN	The next applicant was supposed to be here already?

SIR AWESOME	And I am, my dear. The name is Awesome. SIR AWESOME. Super-spy. Expert linguist.And master of disguise.

CARMEN\JUNI	Hmm//Ooh

SIR AWESOME	Fluent in over 300-languages including my own - Awesomese. 

CARMEN	Do you always work with theme music? That should come in handy for stealth missions. Anyway...

SIR AWESOME	Now, if you’ll please excuse me -- I have a prior engagement.

JUNI	He’s great!

CARMEN	All these applicants have excellent test scores on their cognitive reasoning exams.

JUNI	SNORE! None of them have cool code names or great costumes.	Pass.

CARMEN	Cool code names? Great costumes? That’s your criteria?!?

JUNI	Yeah.Everyone knows the key to kicking butt is intimidation.

CADET GIRLS	Hehe//Soo dreamy.

JUNI	Barfsville. Look at them. So unprofessional. Yep. I see where this is headed. Name?

ACE	Ace, mate.

JUNI	Okay, Ace-mate, I see that you did okay in your training...

ACE	Not Ace-Mate. Just “Ace”, mate.

JUNI	Clearly there is some sort of language barrier here. I think that we should...

CARMEN	I see you graduated top of your class at Junior Marksman’s Academy.

ACE	There’s no weapon I can't master. Slingshot. Laser pistol. I can use it to knock the eyelash off a mozzie at 300-yards.

JUNI	Okay, Ace-Mate, that’ll do. We’ll be in touch. Man, what was with that guy?

CARMEN	Cool codename. Great costume.

JUNI	Nuh-uh. No one’s that perfect.

CARMEN	Well, since we can’t come to an agreement on anyone, we’ll each get two picks for the team - no questions asked. Fair? Finally - we can agree on something. Let’s head back to the dorms and meet tomorrow at the training center to see how our prospects work together. Deal? A thumb-thumb -- how did that get in here?!?	Stand down, creature!

TOM THUMB THUMB	(<Sounds>)

SCORPION	Tom Thumb-Thumb is with me.

CARMEN	And might I ask who “me” is?

SCORPION	The codename’s “Scorpion.”But you’d probably know me best by my civilian name - Claudia Floop.

CARMEN	FLOOP?!? 	As in our former enemy Fegan Floop?!?

SCORPION	The same. He is my father.

CARMEN	Your father? Well that explains the Thumb-Thumb.

TOM THUMB THUMB	([sounds])

CARMEN	But not why you’re standing in my dorm room?

SCORPION	I’m here for the Mission Critical team. I apologize for being late. I was supposed to have been here a few days ago but I had a fashion shoot in Prague.	You know how that is? No. You probably don’t.

CARMEN	Fegan Floop’s daughter wants to be considered for the Mission Critical Team? Now I’ve heard everything.	 Wait - did you re-decorate my room?

SCORPION	Yes.It lacked panache.

CARMEN	I’ll give you panache...

GLITCH	Hey-hey!Oooo, who’s the new roomie? Whoa.Totes vibing on the new look.Panache.

TOM THUMB THUMB	([sounds])


CARMEN	Looks like you’re one cadet shy.

JUNI	Oh, he’ll be here. I hope.

ACE	This is bad form, Junior.

JUNI	It’s Juni. Ju-ni. And call me by my codename. “Aztec.” Ace-Mate.

ACE	Again, it’s just “Ace”, mate.	Not “Ace-Mate.”

JUNI	I still don’t hear the difference.

CARMEN	Well, it looks like I get another candidate selection since your candidate didn’t show. So...

SCORPION	Am I interrupting?

CARMEN	Yes, you are. We were just --

JUNI	No no noooo. Not at all.	You’re just in time --

CARMEN	Are you crazy?	Do you know who that is?	That’s Claudia Floop. Fegan Floop’s daughter. The daughter of a villain. She can’t be trusted?!?

JUNI	Remember what you said “no questions asked.”

CARMEN	Mission Critical, prospects - the test begins now!

JUNI	Attack!

CARMEN	Evade!


JUNI	Okay, team, let’s show’em how it’s done.	Full out attack! Kick butt! The team follows Juni’s lead and goes on the offensive... except for Carmen who hangs back.	She assumes point:

CARMEN	No- evasive action!

JUNI	Attack!

CARMEN	Evade! 
JUNI	Mission Critical, ATTACK!

CARMEN	Mission Critical, EVADE! Evade!

JUNI	Attack!

CARMEN	Evade! Juni, what are you doing?

JUNI	Leading the team. Get out of my way, Carm!

CARMEN	Oh. Hey, mom. Hey, dad. How’s deep cover?


GREGORIO	Unacceptable! Embarrassing!

INGRID	What your father is trying to say is that you must come to an agreement on how to run this team.

JUNI	I know how to run it. She just won’t listen to reason.

CARMEN	Reason?!? Your way will get us all killed.

JUNI	And your way will bore us all to death!

INGRID	Enough, you two!	Sure you’ve had your differences lately but you’ve always been there for each other. Juni, remember in kindergarten when Jeffy Rice took your favorite cuddle bear -- who made him give it back? And Carmen, who was always the first one to volunteer as a test subject for all of your science fair projects? Maybe if you two would just listen to each other, you might actually figure this out.

GREGORIO	But until that time - effective immediately - you are both off Mission Critical.


(END ACT TWO)


(ACT THREE)




VOICE ON TV	A mysterious group calling itself SWAMP has infiltrated a government facility in the desert, making off with a cache of top secret technology.	All attempts to stop this convoy have been futile.

SIR AWESOME	So, what is our plan again?

JUNI	Okay, the three of us are going to stop that SWAMP convoy on our own. Whatever that tech is, it can’t be good in their hands.


CARMEN	Ahem.

JUNI	Copy-cat.

CARMEN	Mature.

JUNI	You are.

CARMEN	Fine. Since neither one of us is going to back down.	Let’s agree to stay out of each other’s way.

JUNI	Done.


SCORPION	This is going to be a long mission.

ACE	Yeah, if we survive it.


CARMEN	There it is. 	Mission Critical, on my signal - get into position.

JUNI	Mission MOST Critical, on my signal - go kick some SWAMP butt.

CARMEN	Really? Mission MOST Critical?

JUNI	Yep. Jealous?

JUNI/CARMEN	NOW! You see. That’s how it’s done.	So much for your boring “tactics”.

CARMEN	Mission Critical - now!

GOLDEN BRAIN	What the--?

CARMEN	Jealous?

JUNI	Look out!


SIR AWESOME	Let me go!

JUNI	Sir Awesome! We need to get in there and help.

CARMEN	I have an idea. Get behind them and follow my lead! Blobs away.

GOON	Haha - she missed!

CARMEN	Scorpion!

JUNI	I’m on it!


GLITCH	OMG. The caravan’s getting away!

CARMEN	Juni, take Ace.

JUNI	Right. You take Scorpion.

CARMEN	Glitch. Sir Awesome. Wait for our signal.

JUNI	We’re gonna need some Awesomese to jam those com-links.

ACE	Whoa, crikey!

JUNI	Ace, are you okay?

ACE	Yeah.Just don’t get me near them.

JUNI	Birds? You’re afraid of birds?

ACE	I just don’t trust them.	With their wings and beaks.	 And tiny birdy feet.

JUNI	I knew it. 	Mr. Perfect.

CARMEN	Okay. Glitch. Awesome. HIT IT!

SIR AWESOME	([speaking gibberish])

GOONS	Aargh, my ears!!/I can’t steer!

JUNI	Thanks, ugly. I’ll take this.

GLITCH	We did it!

CARMEN	Hey, good work out there today.

JUNI	Yeah. You, too.	I guess there is a place for a little thinking mixed with the butt-kicking.

CARMEN	The trick will be figuring out the proper balance. But if you’re going to be on my team, you’re going to need to bone up on your battle tactics.

JUNI	Ha! And if you’re going to be on my team, you’re going to need a cool codename... what do you think about - ”Tango”?

CARMEN	Yeah - I like it. Thanks, “Aztec.”

JUNI	Oh, and remind me to tell you something about Ace.	You won’t believe it.

CARMEN	Ugh, will you stop already.

GREGORIO	Putting that news report up for them to see was a stroke of genius.

INGRID	Call it mother’s intuition.

GREGORIO	They all have a lot left to learn, but the future of the O.S.S. does seem very promising.

SIR AWESOME	To Mission Critical!

GOON	We had a problem, sir.

GOLDEN BRAIN	Problem? What kind of problem?

GOON	The convoy -- it was intercepted by a bunch of...
