Fish	Not so long ago, Humans and Elves fought together during the Great War. 

Fish	That’s me, Fisher.  As a human, I was awarded the highest honors for my bravery.

Fish	But what was even more rewarding was the love of Liya, Princess of the Elves.  She calls me Little Fish.

Fish	 Even though we had to return to our own separate worlds, I'm not worried.

Fish	After all, we slayed a dragon. A long distance relationship is nothing compared to a dragon!  Right?

Liya	(gasp) It's so beautiful!

Liya	And you'll look even prettier in the dress.

Liya	I'm excited. Aren't you?
Mayre	(OM lifting veil effort) / (OM breathy smile)
Mayre	[ON and MNS] You know I am. I've waited centuries for this day.
Liya	(OM grabbing hand/laughing)
Mayre	Liya, ^ thank you for choosing my wedding gown.
Liya	[over cut] (gasp) Uh…oh yeah…^ Regarding Fish…Have you…
Mayre	[ON to MNS] You must be aware.  Your brother is very against this.
Mayre	But that said… how could I not let our human allies attend…they helped us win the war.
Liya	I don't believe it! I know it must've been a difficult decision.
Liya	Thank you May--- I mean, your Highness. (courtesy effort)
Mayre	(sigh)
Mayre	[MNS] Most elves in the Kingdom are like your brother, and are prejudiced against humans…
Mayre	Do your friends a favor and make sure they behave.
Liya	(prancing around happily efforts)
Liya	(nod) (running off happily)
Mayre	(sigh)
LIya	Go!  Take this to my Fish!

Fish	Really? ^ You gotta be kidding me…  Two coins?  For the weapon of a Dragonslayer!?!

Large Man	Huh, looks like a plain ole meat cleaver to me.

Fish	A meat cleaver forged by a Dragonslayer!

Large Man	Huh?

Fish	Huh?
Fish	Here, catch!
Large Man	Whoa…
Fish	 Thanks from Liya!
Fish	Wait…that's my letter.  Come back here…
Fish	You gonna hand it over or not.
Fish	Huh? (smile)
Fish	Hey…get!
Fish	In celebration, your presence is requested at…
Fish	(CT teethy inhale) Wait, how do I even read that?
Fish	The Royal Union of the Elf Queen to the Duke…
Fish	Wha…?
Fish	(OM encouraging breath) ^ The human Fish and his companions are invited to the wedding!
Fish	(OM happy gasp) I can't believe it!
Fish	I'm going to the Elf Kingdom!
Fish	I get to see Liyaaaaaaaa!!!!
Fish	Hmm
Fish	Give her this.
Fish	And no detours!  Ok?  Hey?
Fish	Yes!
Fish	Liya, Liya, Liya, Liya, Liya!
Fish	Closing up shop for the day. 
Fish	I have work to do.
Meyla	 In the ruins of a battlefield long forgotten…
Meyla	Among the forgotten souls of Elf kingdom.
Meyla	Lies the forgotten gem.
Meyla	And the forgotten, me.
Meyla	(chuckle) I couldn't ask for a more perfect scenario.
Meyla	Now, dark gem…
Meyla	I offer to you a sacrifice…
Meyla	Let the Elven blood that flows through me bind us together. Let these ruins be our alter…
Meyla	And let these forgotten spirits be our witnesses!
Meyla	(laughter)
Meyla	Beware atop the Throne of Elves…
Meyla	For soon it shall be mine.
Meyla	(evil laughter into intense sounds)  
Liya	Hm…huh?
WALLA Villagers	(mixed) huh?
Fish	Be quiet! ^ This isn't easy to do.
Fish	(intense pushed by wind sounds)
Fish	Huh?
Fish	(Knocked over sounds)
Fish	What are you guys doin-g-g-g?  Huh…what is that?
Pumpkin Zombie	Growl
Fish	En garde!
Fish	PumpkinHead?  Where do you think you're going? Stop!
Blacksmith	Pesky fly!
Fish	You won't get away that easily!
Fish	Hey, Arrow! Get him!
Fish	Bow, open the furnace!
Bow (Dog)	We're having pumpkin pie tonight!
Blacksmith	Hey...Ya wanna keep it down!?!
Blacksmith	I’m not deaf yet…
Fish	Wait-wait-wait!  There was a floating Pumpkin Something!  [continuing behind Blacksmith’s head]  It’s in the furnace.
Fish	oh...it smells delicious.  It's gone!
Blacksmith	A ring!
Blacksmith	Uhh.  I teach you the secrets of forging weapons, and you use my furnace to cook pumpkins and make trinkets? (OM surprised reax)
Fish	It's not what you think.  It's a…ahhh.
Fish	You know what this is?
Fish	(shoot arrow sound)  When you pull the bowstring, ' you can injure your finger. ^ This protects it!
Blacksmith	 And what will protect your heart, huh?
Blacksmith	Love between an elf and a human...will only end in tragedy.  You mark my words.
Fish	Don't be so dramatic! ^ Without tragedy, you can't have comedy!

Fish	Besides…^ good things can come out of tragedy, like me meeting Liya. Right?
Meyla	Sisterssss…
Meyla	Come my sisters… my forgotten souls...Come!  Let us give the Queen a wedding present she will never forget.  (Evil laughter.)
Captain B	(Blowing sounds)
Fish	Woah? The Fish… Cap named her after me!  C’mon boys, let’s go! Ha.
Fish	hey...hey Cap!  How's it going? Request permission to board?
Captain B	Yeah, yeah…I see ya.
Captain B	What's he doing here? ^ Hmph. ^  I'd rather throw him overboard.
Blacksmith	Ahhh…we're flying.  I feel like a bird up here.  Ah...I can see my house from here.  Heh, heh, heh.  Oh no…I left the back door open.
Fish	Cap! Look! Here are the rules of ettiquette for the Elf Kingdom! Uh….
Captain B	wha?
Fish	Rule two hundred fifty…When meeting someone new, one must bow at 10 degrees…
Fish	If their bow is less than 5 degrees or more than fifty, it won't be recognized!

Captain B	We're not going to learn all those...… We don’t all have elf girlfriends.Captain BNo, no, no! Not in the ship!
Blacksmith	Ugh…eggs benedict coming up. 
Captain B	Baaahhh.
Fish	(Moving to the music sounds)
Fish	Ahh
Blacksmith	Look… ^
Fish	Awesome
Blacksmith	The finest example of my craftsmanship…
Blacksmith	The best design idea I've ever had…
Blacksmith	Just add a flying gem of the highest quality you can find…
Blacksmith	…and you can experience the joy of soaring among the clouds!
Blacksmith	This will be…the fastest flying experience ever!
Fish	Thanks Birdy!  It's the most amazing gift ever!  You're the man!
Blacksmith	Shush.  Waste your bletheriing.
Fish	Hey Birdy?  Ah…have you tested this thing out yet?
Blacksmith	Huh?
Fish	Wait! You never told me how it works!
Blacksmith	It's simple!!
Blacksmith	You just…make like a bird!  Flappy, flappy, flappy.  Faster!
Fish	Outta my way, birds.
Fish	That's it! Fly like a bird!
Fish	Come on!
Captain B	Hey ol' timer?  Toilet's the other way. 
Captain B	 And where's Fish?
Blacksmith	(grunt) What do you think I'm looking for?

Blacksmith	Yah, I'm guessing… He's that wee black dot over there!  See?
Captain B	What?
Blacksmith	Can you see it?  There.  Just above the Albatross. 
Blacksmith	 Oh, no, over there.  
Blacksmith	Are you blind?  Or what?
Captain B	You get him back on the ship right now Right now!  Or you’ll be a little red dot!
Fish	Whoohooo! / Just like a bird, ha ha...am I right?
Fish	(laugh) Master Blacksmith, best invention ever!
Fish	Bow! Arrow!, Hop on!
Fish	Liya! Here I come.  Whoo hoo.
Captain B	Huh.  And I thought I've seen it all.
Blacksmith	Hee hee.  Am I a genius, or what?  Ho ho.  That is my mona lisa, that is my "Piece de Resistance"!  That is my "Great Wall".  Ha ha.

Captain B	Will you calm down?  
Captain B	Yeah, you built a surfboard, and I built this massive warship.  So what?  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah…whatever.
Walla Elves	What is that?  Is…is that a human ship?  Who's is it?  I don't know…, Are they attending the wedding?  I hear they were invited by the queen.  How could that be?
Fish	Liya!
Liya	Is that you?
Liya	Little Fish!   It's you!
Liya	Hang on!
Liya	Long time no see! 
Liya	Well!
Liya	Hello stranger!
Fish	You’re just as beautiful…
Fish	Don't you want to introduce your handsome human to everyone. Ha... I meant handsome hero!

Liya	I can’t wait! But… let’s not attract too much attention… Aaaahh!

Liya	Coming through…sorry.  Scuze us.
Fish	Your brother knows I’m here… right? 
Liya	Well, he'll know soon enough. (giggle)
Liya	Heehh...Watch out
Fish	Then, hold me tight!  
Liya	Shouldn't we slow down
Fish	Nah, just hold tigher!  You're not holding tight enough!
Liya	Ha...Fine! You asked for it… (Laughing / she’s tickling him) 
Fish	Okay, alright stop stop.

Fish	Queen Mayre! Congratulations!
Fish	Huh?  Huh?  Oh!
Fish	Hey! You should bow!   Hey.  That's the Queen!
Mayre	(Small laugh)
Fish	Heh.  Come on.  
Liya	Whoooaaaa!
Fish	Heh, heh…let's see how fast this thing can go.
Kyle	Why didn't you tell me they were invited?
Mayre	Because I knew you wouldn't agree to it.
Mayre	But the truth is, he is your sister's boyfriend.
Kyle	Boyfriend?
Kyle	Human lives are but a blip compared to ours.
Kyle	How can a mighty oak fall in love with a tiny flower.
Mayre	If we know it's temporary and won't last.
Mayre	Why should it involve you.
Kyle	Because she is being selfish and immature. And this relationship will destroy Liya before it's over.
Mayre	Liya will grow wiser with time.
Mayre	We need to let her learn from her experiences.
Kyle	There's no time!
Kyle	There've been reports of strange monsters spotted.
Kyle	They say…^ it may have something to do with this Dark wind.
Mayre	What?
Kyle	There is an invisible enemy on the horizon.
Kyle	So you see…/ Liya must wake up!
Mayre	Don't worry, ^ she's not a child.
Kyle	You and I have a love that is eternal.
Kyle	It is based on respect. ' That is the proper way for us elves.
Mayre	Hmmm
Fish walla	walla
Liya walla	walla
Kyle	We must protect the Gem of Life.
Kyle	That is the reason for our existence.
Kyle	You know this as well as I.
Mayre	(breath)
Liya	Little Fish, I’m so happy you’re here.  I can't stop smiling.
Fish	From now on, you’ll always be smiling.
WALLA - Fairies (4 F)	walla

Mayre	The Green Gem of Life. ^ The root of life for the elves. And our source of energy.
Mayre	Only us elves, can draw power from it.
Liya	It's amazing. I've never been this close before!
Mayre	Originally, there was only one gem.
Mayre	But the gods split it in two, one dark and one green...
Mayre	...to represent death and life.
Mayre	And the perpetual battle between light and dark that has plagued the human world for milenia
Mayre	No one knows where the dark gem is.
Mayre	But this one, has always been protected by the elves. Here.
Mayre	The Queen wears the gem at her wedding. ^ That's our tradition.
Mayre	It's magic, will bring prosperity to the kingdom.
Mayre	Liya, ^ you should wear it to the wedding though.
Liya	You sure? / Why me?
Mayre	Because of the Dark Gem, I've felt its power.
Mayre	It still exists, '  and grows even stronger.
Mayre	And nearer.
Mayre	 The Gem of Life is no longer safe in Alyan and my hands.
Mayre	You are who we trust most. ' So you must protect it.
Liya	(breath)
Liya	(breath) You won't be disappointed in me! (breath)
Liya	It's so beautiful. 
Liya	I can't wait to show it to Fish
Mayre	Liya!
Liya	Huh?
Mayre	I think you and I should have a talk.
Fish	Ha…wow.  The Elf Kingdom is awesome.

Captain B	Yeah.  People ignoring us, turning up their noses? What's there to love?
Fish	What? ^ No way.  Wait.
Fish	Hi. Excuse me, ma'm.  I'm Fish.  Nice to meet you.  My friend was wondering if you were…
Blacksmith	Ah, save your breath kid.
Blacksmith	Nobody wants to hear your blethering.
Blacksmith	I'm about to put up with it day in...day out.
Captain B	Speak for yourself.
Elf Captain	Wait
Fish	Huh?
Elf Captain	Stop Here
Fish	Ahhh
Captain B	That's right.  I’m human.  
Captain B	I like to dance, and sing…
Fish	Hah…
Fish	Sorry about him. Long journey. 
Elf Captain	Before entering, ' you must give up your weapons.
Captain B	Look, lady?
Fish	Uh…right.  No worries.
Blacksmith	Ha ha ha…there ya go.

Fish	That was all his weapons!
Captain B	Hmmm
Fish	hah…ha ha….ahhhh
Captain B	Heh, heh
Blacksmith	Well, that went much better than expected, wouldn’t ya say? Heh?
Mayre	Don't forget your mission, Liya.
Mayre	You can do this.
Elf Citizen (male)	ahhh
Captain B	(push sound)	
Captain B	If I don't get any wedding cake, I'm going to eat one of these Elves.
Mayre	[VO flashback]  The Gem of Life is a sacred Elven Treasure.
Mayre	[VO flashback] You cannot let Fish nor any other human near it.
Liya	[flashback] I can't?
Liya	[flashback] Why not?
Mayre	[flashback] Because the Gem must remain far away from desire or conflict
Mayre	[flashback] And that means you cannot risk exposing it to any humans.
Liya	[flashback MNS~ON] How could you possibly say that?
Liya	[flashback] Little Fish is a good man.
Liya	[flashback]  He’s loyal, I trust him and he loves me.
Mayre	[flashback] How long have you known him? ^ A few years?
Mayre	[flashback] I'm afraid (that) from now on… /
Mayre	[flashback] You must stay away from Little Fish.

Liya	[flashback] No, no, please anything but that. 
Liya	[flashback] I actually thought you understood.
Mayre	[flashback] Liya!
Mayre	[flashback] It's not about that! 
Mayre	[flashback, ON~MNS] It’s our duty and responsibility to protect the kingdom. Do not risk our lives for something that cannot last. 

Fish	Liya!
Fish	Liya!
Fish	Liya!  Oops, sorry.   Liya!
Captain B	Heh, heh…Bird, you need a boost?  I betcha you can't see anything from way down there.
Fish	Hmm
Fish	Hah…It's beautiful up here!
Liya	This is my favorite place.
Captain B	"APPLESAUCE"
Mayre	As the tender shoot reaches toward the sky…
Kyle	And the roots plant firmly in the ground…
Mayre	So has our love bloomed...
Kyle	And will only keep flourshing…
Mayre	[MNS] Love is life and life is love.
Kyle	[ovlp] We are bonded, as all living things have been and will be...
Fish	Liya…^ is something wrong?
Mayre	[ovlp] Bonded together...
Kyle	[ovlp] Bonded together...
Liya	This is for you.
Liya	I had this gift especially made.
Liya	I hope it reminds you of me.

Fish	Wow! ^ This is great! ^
Fish	Hey! ^ Liya…
Fish	I got you something, too.  
Fish	And, you'll never guess what it is!
Fish	You made me this bow. ^ and I made you that finger guard.
Liya	I love it. / Thank you.
Fish	Guess we go together like ths bow and that finger guard? 
Liya	What?
Fish	Liya…
Fish	I don't ever want to leave you.
Fish	I finished my training with the Blacksmith and I really want to stay here with you.
Fish	What do you say? 
Fish	Huh?

Blacksmith	(running scared sounds)
Kyle	What do you want from us, Meyla!?
Meyla	You know very well why I am here.
Mayre	Then you'll be disappointed.
Meyla	Why isn't the Gem on you?
Meyla	Tell me where it is!
Mayre	Somewhere you'd never think to look.
Meyla	(Evil laugh)  You're no match. ' Tell me where it is.
Meyla	Tell me!
Meyla	 How dare you… ' foolish human!
Liya	Help him, Please!
Liya	No!
Meyla	My dear Alyan…
Meyla	If you want your bride back…
Meyla	Then you'll give me what I want.
Meyla	Three days from now, ' meet me at the Ancient Battleground.
Meyla	And next time, don't shoot arrows at me, human.
Meyla	You have been warned
Fish	Bow!  Arrow!
Elf Captain	Fire.
Kyle	Ready the ship! We leave immediately!
Walla Elf Army	Yessir!
Elf Captain	Yessir!
Kyle	Liya, you know where the maps is. ^ Go and get it!
Kyle	Humans, you are not welcome here. Leave now.
Liya	You have to go.  I'll miss you.
Liya	I'm so sorry, Fish.
Fish	I'll come with you. 
Liya	No, this is between us Elves. 
Fish	I know, but, ' it's too dangerous!
Fish	Please let me help you.  We can all help you!
Liya	You should go.
Liya	Just go back.
Fish	Liya! 
Liya	Goodbye, Fish. 
Fish	No…Liya!
Fish	No…wait.  We’re going to follow them. 
Captain B	Look, I know you've got good looking hair and all, but she doesn't want you!
Blacksmith	Yeah, you were dumped, kid.
Blacksmith	I should know, it happens to me a lot!
Fish	She doesn’t mean it. 
Captain B	Ahggghhh.
Fish	And I know she needs my help. 
Captain B	Look, kid…
Captain B	Rescuing the princess sounds fun and all…
Captain B	But I’m gonna need a little more motivation.
Fish	Just prep the ship! ^ Look…and besides they've taken my dogs!
Captain B	Dogs?
Blacksmith	Uh, not the dogs! ^ I couldn't live without those two slobbering mutts.
Captain B	Uh…(Howl sound)
Kyle	We are at full speed, ' we should arrive in two days.
Kyle	Liya, ^ is the Gem of life safe?
Kyle	Protect it with your life. ^ And trust no one.
Liya	Meyla isn't trustworthy. ^ How do we know she will keep her end of the bargain?
Kyle	Even if she doesn't, we have no other choice.
Kyle	Don't worry about saving Mayre, ^ the soldiers and I will do it.
Kyle	Protect the Gem. ^ Just focus on that.
Fish	Liya!
Liya	Little Fish!
Fish	Come, let's go.
Liya	Are you crazy? You shouldn’t be here
Fish	I have a plan…. We can save Mayre together.
Liya	No. 
Fish	What?
Liya	 We already have a plan in place.
Fish	Ha…so what is the plan?
Fish	Show up in a large ship ^ for  a sneak attack?  Hmmm?
Fish	Then, come with me instead.
Fish	I can fly faster, and grab her before they notice.
Fish	Trust me.
Fish	As long as we're together, ^ There's nothing we can't do.
Liya	Woah.
Fish	Ah, why didn’t you take my gift earlier? Don’t you like it, Liya?
Liya	Now's not the time to discuss that. 
Liya	(shiver) I can feel it getting colder.
Fish	Then, come here, I’ll keep you warm. 
Liya	We’re going North… why? 
Liya	The Ancient Battlegrounds are South- you’re going the wrong way! 
Fish	Promise
Fish	(CT in pain reax) I feel strange.
Liya	Are you wounded? 
Fish	(OM breath) It's nothing.
Liya	I don’t believe it. 
Liya	What is Meyla’s ship doing here?! 
Meyla	I'll ask one more time. Why were you not wearing the Gem
Mayre	It's quite simple. I knew you were coming.
Meyla	(laugh) You can't fight destiny
Meyla	It was always the fate of these two gems to be reuinted again.
Mayre	You should give up while you can.
Mayre	Alyan will never allow you to have the other Gem. 
Mayre	I will pardon you for your sins.
Mayre	And you can come back home to us.
Meyla	Hmph.  How polite of you sister
Meyla	Did you think I would just quietly hand over my hard-earned treasure?
Meyla	Sorry, but I have other plans.	
Meyla	Once I get the map to the Elf kingdom…
Meyla	You won't mind helping me, will you?
Meyla	Come~
Meyla	Come to me…
Fish	Over there!
Fish	Liya…^ Found her.
Liya	(OM gasp) Your Highness!
Mayre	Liya…you have to go!
Meyla	My child…  ^ Did it not occur to you that you were summoned here for a reason?
Fish	Liya!
Liya	You should go back to notify Alyan!
Fish	Liya!
Fish	Liya!
Liya	Fish!
Fish	Grab my hand!]
Fish	You're safe now.
Liya	You have to let me go.
Fish	Not a chance!
Liya	Little Fish...
Liya	You saved me. 
Fish	Well, actually., we saved each other.
Liya	We should go back to the others.
Meyla	Heh, he can not go back
Kyle	Where were you?

Fish	Ah, we snuck onboard Meyla's ship!  She has the Queen!
Liya	It's not what we thought. Meyla is actually… 	
Kyle	You took a human to go after Meyla?
Kyle	Have you forgotten about your mission?
Kyle	You played right into ther hands
Liya	I’m so sorry. 
Fish	and what were you doing…!
Kyle	Stop it!
Kyle	You've done enough! ^ You don't belong here!
Kyle	Leave! / And don't come back!
Kyle	That's why we don't get close to humans.
Kyle	You've behaved immaturely.
Kyle	And after the Queen put her trust in you!
Fish	Hey, don't talk to her like that!
Liya	It’s okay. 
Liya	Alyan's right.
Liya	I shouldn’t have left with you. 
Liya	And you shouldn’t be here at all. 
Liya	I know it’s hard…
Liya	You have to leave. You don’t belong here. 
Fish	I belong with you. You know that. 
Liya	All I know, is that you have to leave and never come back. 
Fish	Are you serious?  You can't possibly mean that!
Liya	Ah, please, just go.
Liya	You’re not an Elf. 
Liya	Goodbye, Fish. 

Fish	Liya… ^ You've changed.
Kyle	Attention!
Kyle	Full speed ahead!
Kyle	Prepare for battle. No more mistakes
Meyla	Human boy…
Meyla	The power of the Dark Gem courses through my body and my veins.
Meyla	I can feel it in my blood… ^ pulsing…
Meyla	Can you feel it as well?
Meyla	Come to me.
Meyla	Answer my call
Meyla	I know what you want...
Meyla	And only I, can give it to you
Captain B	Aye! ^ Welcome back sleepy head?
Captain B	Man! ^ you look terrible!
Captain B	Why the long face?
Captain B	Love is not for the likes of us, pal.
Fish	I don’t get it. ^  I thought we were in love.
Captain B	(Laugh)
Captain B	They're some realities you got to accept.
Captain B	This relationship was doomed from the start!
Captain B	Stop dreaming...
Captain B	They don’t come with instruction manuals. ^ And if they did…
Captain B	We wouldn't read’em…
Captain B	Would we, kid?
Captain B	Because reading is hard, right?
Captain B	I'm proud of you.
Captain B	This may be your first heartbreak.
Captain B	But it won’t be your last, so cheer up.
Blacksmith	Uhh, listen to an expert, Fish.
Blacksmith	Uh, sometimes loving someone means letting that person go.
Fish	Liya and I are different.
Fish	What do you two know, anyways?
Fish	I'm not giving up!
Captain B	Hey! ^ Where are you going?
Fish	To do what I know is right.
Meyla	It's light has gone out again.
Meyla	Do you think that in the ice mountain will satisfy its appetite?
Mayre	You've desecrated the spirits of the Ancient Battlefield.
Mayre	Now you're going to steal the souls of the dragons?
Meyla	My dear little Mayre… Don’t be afraid.
Mayre	The Dark Gem has changed you…
Mayre	You've gone too far Meyla!
Meyla	See how wrong you can be?
Meyla	The elf I've become to day.
Meyla	It is not due to the gem, it is due…^ to you.
Mayre	What?
Mayre	How can you say that? I've been on your side.
Meyla	I'm not blaming…
Meyla	I'm thanking you, Mayre.
Meyla	If it weren't for the fact that I was better than you, and yet constantly shunned…
Meyla	If it weren't for the fact that only you could use the Gem of Life, so I was abandoned.
Meyla	If it weren't for the fact that you, my younger sister became the heir, leaving me to become a dark elf…
Meyla	Then I would've never known, the type of power that I have now.	
Mayre	Envy… Hatred…
Mayre	These are not the natural qualities of an elf!
Meyla	But they are qualities of a victor.
Meyla	And I will now reclaim what is rightfully mine!
Mayre	(gasp) It was only you two! (laugh)
Mayre	Is Fish with you?
Mayre	Do you, think you can help me  with something?
Meyla	Darkest of Gems…
Meyla	I've opened up the graveyard of the dragons for you...
Meyla	Legend says, the soul of a powerful dragon has been sealed in this ice for a thousand years…
Meyla	I thought, you might want a new friend...
Meyla	You certainly took your time human boy.
Meyla	We’ve been waiting for you.
Fish	Who are you, anyway?
Fish	And what have you done to me?
Meyla	We are kindred spirits.
Meyla	We both desire, things that we cannot have.
Fish	We are not alike!
Meyla	(laugh) Oh I beg to differ…
Meyla	Let's see…
Meyla	We would do anything, to get what we want the most.
Meyla	…and nothing we have done
Meyla	has truly been appreciated
Meyla	Hmmm…so beautiful.

Meyla	Like you, it longs for another.
Meyla	The souls of the dragons have only made it stronger…
Meyla	 It cannot wait. It must be reunited with the Gem of Life.
Fish	There's another Gem?
Meyla	Liya didn’t tell you?
Meyla	Of course she didn’t.
Meyla	You're a human.
Meyla	How could she ever trust you with something so beautiful and precious as an Elven Gemstone.
Fish	This is an Elven matter… ^
Fish	What's it got to do with me?
Meyla	So you’re giving up then?  What a pity…
Meyla	I could help you.
Meyla	Nothing makes me happier than watching young love blossom.  And you deserve it.
Meyla	Once I'm Queen, Liya will be all yours…
Fish	Huh?
Meyla	Honestly.
Meyla	I'm sure she’s worth so much more…
Meyla	ll I need is for you to bring me the map of Elves.
Meyla	Bring me the Map of Elves… 
Fish	(pain sounds)  Fix my hand, then we'll talk.
Meyla	You're in no position to negotiate, child.
Fish	Then you can find your own map!
Meyla	Your friends are walking into an ambush as we speak…
Meyla	Shall we try this again?
Meyla	Bring me… the map of Elves. Or suffer the consequences.
Fish	I’m not your puppet.
Meyla	Are you sure about that? (laugh)
Elf Captain	Prince Alyan, we've found no traces of Queen Mayre.
Liya	Brother!
Liya	What will we do now? We can't give up.
Kyle	Maintain our cover, ^ but keep searching.
Kyle	Positions!
Kyle	Fire!
Kyle	Port side! ^ Full scale attack.
Kyle	Now!
Kyle	Everyone regroup! Prepare to counter attack!
Liya	Little Fish!
Kyle	Aim for the chest…
Elf Captain	The ship won't make it.
Kyle	Gather the remaining troops!
Blacksmith	Hi Fishy, Fishy!  Ha ha ha.  
Fish	Master Blacksmith!
Blacksmith	Over here kid!  Hey look, I'm flying.	

Fish	Masters!
Captain B	Hold it steady!
Blacksmith	What do you think I'm trying to do?
Captain B	We humans don't fight like Elves! 
Captain B	Elves dance in the moonlight and play with flowers.
Captain B	We eat meat and drink wine. Ha!
Blacksmith	Flowers!  I'll give you flowers!!
Fish	Quick! ^ Get on the other ship!
Fish	Liya!
Meyla	Bring me the map of Elves…

Meyla	Or suffer the consequences. 
Captain B	Look at this damage!
Captain B	When this is all over, it's gonna cost you. 
Captain B	and it won't be cheap.
Kyle	We’ll just buy your ship. ^ Go ahead human, name your price.
Captain B	Argh! I can't believe your pointy-eared arrogance!
Captain B	This ship is mine! ^ And it’s priceless.
Kyle	It reeks of dog and the stench of old men.
Kyle	A sack of silver should be sufficient.
Captain B	Silver~? ^ 
Captain B	Don't you mean gold? And a sack as large as I can carry while you're at it.
Kyle	Consider it done.
Captain B	Huh…?
Kyle	And collect your belongings.  I want you off my ship as soon as possible.
Captain B	Well, I guess I'm gonna need a new ship, huh?
Fish	How could you sell the Fish?]
Captain B	I should’ve asked for more, shouldn’t I?
Fish	How will we help Liya now?
Captain B	The deal's off. ^   Forget it!-I'm keeping the ship. It's priceless anyway!
Captain B	And besides, I don't want your stinkin Elven money!
Blacksmith	 If you don't want the money. I'll take it!

Captain B	 Shut up old man!
Liya	How could you? ^ If it weren't for them, we'd all be dead already!
Liya	We are already outnumbered as it is. ^ We need their help!
Kyle	Did you see his hand? 
Kyle	 The Dark Gem is consuming him.

Kyle	He's a danger to all of us!
Liya	The Dark Gem?
Liya	What's going to happen to Fish?
Kyle	The Dark Gem will infect his mind.
Kyle	And then ^ he will be lost, becoming nothing more than the Gem's puppet.
Kyle	Just like Meyla.
Kyle	If Meyla could not resist it, what chance does a human have
Liya	Can we save him with the Gem of Life?
Kyle	It's not some toy you can use for your selfish needs!
Liya	Doesn't this Gem naturally repel the Dark one?  Why can't we use it?
Kyle	(Breath)
Kyle	 It has never been attempted on a human, could make it worse.
Kyle	I cannot allow the risk.
Kyle 	[flashback] If Meyla can not resist it, what chance does a human have?
Meyla [PULL]	[flashback] Nothing makes me happier than watching young love blossom.  And you deserve it.
Meyla [PULL]	[flashback]  Once I'm Queen, Liya will be all yours…
Blacksmith	Ah, there you go.  Right there. Hm?
Fish	Master Blacksmith…
Blacksmith	Hmm?
Fish	Do you think I could borrow your board again?
Blacksmith	Ah…ooh...You can have it.
Blacksmith	What's the point of an invention if no one uses it.  Huh?
Blacksmith	Just don't push it too hard.
Blacksmith	Uh… ^ I'm serious! ^ You be careful!
Liya	Is there really nothing we can do?

Liya	Are we giving up just like that?
Kyle	Once we get back, I'll reach out to our neighboring allies.
Kyle	Get reinforcements.
Liya	But what about Queen Mayre?
Kyle	Protecting the Gem…Is protecting the Queen.
Kyle	You Human!
Liya	No!
Kyle	Do you still trust this human?
Meyla	Sister have a look… ^
Meyla	It's even more beautiful now.
Meyla	That's why what I desire…^ should never be taken lightly. (laugh)
Meyla	Sooo….
Meyla	How does it feel to finally be rejected?
Meyla	The Dark Gem can only be held by those who wield true power.
Meyla	Did you really think someone like you could steal it?
Meyla	My dear little sister, I originally  wanted you to witness my ascention to the throne…
Meyla	However after this, you're lack of respect for me, is giving me second thoughts.
Meyla	What's the point, of even keeping you alive.
Fish	Stop! Don't hurt her!
Fish	I brought you the map!
Mayre	The map…
Mayre	No, stop! You can't give that to her!
Fish	Take us safely back…^  and I'll give it to you.
Fish	Huh...You…
Meyla	If you want to negotiate, you have to have something to negotiate with...
Meyla	Too bad…

Meyla	You don't have anything.  (chuckle)

Meyla	Let's ask the Elf Map where the Gem of Life is…
Meyla	Your Queen is just dying to know.
Fish	Ughh...Liya! (panting) Don't you dare harm her! You hear me?!
Meyla	Who said I had plans for harming her?...
Meyla	But you though...
Liya	YOU! 
Liya	You have no idea what you’ve done. 
Fish	Ahhh...Liya…
Fish	I've been infected by the Dark Gem...
Fish	(breath)  I need the Gem of Life,
Liya	How did you know that I have the Gem of Life?
Fish	Meyla told me.  
Fish	Liya…Will you save me? 
Kyle	Liya!
Kyle	Don't listen to him!
Captain B	Fish! ^ Hurry! Run!
Blacksmith	They're not messin’ around, boy.    Go while you still can!
Fish	Give me the Gem of Life!  Now!
Kyle	(groaning) Meyla?
Liya	Meyla?
Meyla	It's a shame. I guess you figured it out.
Kyle	Liya! ^ Hurry! Do it!
Captain B	No!
Fish	What are you waiting for, Liya?
Liya	Little Fish!
Liya	The Gem of Life.

Liya	Why'd this happen? 
Kyle	 It's no use.
Kyle	Liya… 
Liya	The Gem may be useless to humans, but for me that's not true.
Kyle	What are you doing?!
Liya	What's the point of protecting the Gem of Life?
Kyle	Liya!
Liya	In order to protect it…
Liya	We've sacrificed so much..
Liya	Do we have to watch our loved ones die now too?
Liya	If so, then what is the point of protecting it?
Kyle	But then, ^ you'll get infected too.
Liya	I have to!
Fish	 Liya…
Fish	(breath) Liya. 
Liya	It's you. ^ You're back.
Liya	(crys)
Fish	There's no need to cry.
Fish	You did the best you could.
Fish	It was my fault.
Fish	I didn't respect that you had this responsibility.
Fish	I wanted to be the hero and save the day.
Fish	Instead I put everyone else in danger
Fish	My life is short I know.
Fish	And I've wasted it.
Fish	You deserve better.
Fish	The Queen's in seventh peak of the Dark Valley.
Fish	She’s in terrible danger
Fish	Liya…
Fish	We must go back for the queen
Fish	 We can go together.  
Fish	Will you come with me?
Captain B	Hey Ears?  Make that "Plus One".
Blacksmith	And me.
Captain B	Huh?
Captain B	How 'bout "One and a half"...
Blacksmith	What?  The nerve!
Kyle	That settles it then
Kyle	All right…
Kyle	Let's go together!
Kyle	Set a course for the Dark Valley!
Meyla	I see…
Meyla	It looks like we'll be having some guests.
Meyla	We'll be sure to give them a proper welcome.
Fish	That's Meyla's ship!
Captain B	Watch out! ^ All hands! ^ Evavsive manuevers!
Meyla	Liya..
Meyla	Be a good girl and give me the Gem.
Kyle	Meyla!
Meyla	Hmn?
Kyle	I won't let you do this!
Captain B	Yeah!

Captain B	Whatever he said!
Fish	Liya!
Meyla	Quick! ^ Use the ship to ram them!
Fish	C'mon!  Run! 
Fish	 She's over there!
Fish	Master!
Captain B	Oh, sorry
Fish	Mayre's at the end of this path…
Fish	We can't get thru
Liya	Is there another way?
Fish	If only we had the board. ^ Then we could fly there.
Liya	Wait!
Liya	I have an idea.
Fish	Come! ^ We've…we got to get out of here!
Liya	It's no use. It's a dead end.
Meyla	I'm sick and tired of your meddling!
Fish	Liya!
Meyla	Since you won't die, you may as well witness my coronation.
Meyla	Liya…^ it's time you handed me the Gem of Life.
Liya	You are…too..late…
Captain B	Fish, NO!
Fish	Nooooooo…
Meyla	Where is the Gem of Life?
Captain B	Whatever you do, kid, just don’t let go.
Meyla	What? Is no one going to save Liya? (laugh)
Meyla	Well you had your chance.

Fish	Liya!
Meyla	Why won't you help me? You belong to me!
Fish	The Gem is not yours anymore!
Mayre	And it doesn't belong to anyone!
Meyla	You ARE mine. 
Fish	Ha…easy Arrow.  Ok, alright, Bow.  Stop.  Hey Buddy.
Liya	Your Majesty!
Fish	Stop, guys.
Captain B	Ahh..woah…ok...alright, alright, alright.
Mayre	Thank you…
Fish	Your Highness.
Mayre	... for all your help…
Liya	Little fish!
Meyla	I told you…^ I would be Queen!
Mayre	Everyone run!
Fish	Bow! Arrow! C'mon!  Hurry!
Fish	Watch out.
Captain B	Take a right!
Captain B	Hurry! She's right behind us!
Mayre	Don't look back, just run!
Captain B	I should've never come along!
Captain B	Now what do we do? That thing is your sister!!
Captain B	And I thought my sister was bad.
Fish	[flashback] Open the furnace!
Fish	(Yell)
Fish	Listen up.  I have an idea.

Captain B	Uh…Huh!
Fish	But...
Fish	You're gonna have to trust me.
Liya	You know I do.
Mayre	We trust you as well.
Captain B	Ditto
Mayre	Meyla!
Mayre	I have what you want right here!
Fish	Here.
Fish	Alyan!  Hurry.
Blacksmith	Whooo...I'm a bird!  Ha, ha, ha.
Fish	Master Blacksmith!
Captain B	Gotcha!
Blacksmith	Ah, nice catch.
Liya	Hang in there Little Fish! I'm holding onto you and never letting go!
Liya	Little Fish…
Liya	Look! ^ I'm wearing the ring you gave me …See?
Liya	And guess what else? 
Liya	I’m never taking it off. 
Fish	Liya… I love you
Liya	No!!!!
Liya	Little Fish!!
Meyla	(Hissing sounds)
Meyla	Yessss...
Meyla	…Bring me the Gem...
Meyla	Yess...
Meyla	(snicker laugh)
Meyla	Yess…yesss….yesss.
Liya	Nooo!
Meyla	The gem, it's beautiful.
Meyla	You're finally mine!!
Meyla	Now that I have you, life can be a part of death.
Meyla	The Throne of Elves, the Throne of the World, is within my grasp!
Meyla	The Gem of Life is mine! 
Meyla	The Gem of Life is mine! 
Fish	Did anybody ever tell you, that you need to learn to let things go?! Ugh!!
Mayre	Liya…
Liya	(crying) Little Fish…
Captain B	Oh….kid.
Mayre	Liya!
Liya	Little Fish! (little sob).  You’re alive! 
Liya	You jerk!
Fish	(being hit sound)  Liya…
Liya	Stop! / Don't you dare do that again!
Kyle	I don't believe it
Kyle	No human has ever… fused with the gem.
Mayre	Maybe… ^ you should look at humans differently.
Mayre	He's proof.  They're capable of sacrifice.
Mayre	Maybe that was what the Gem was trying to do…to show us what in Life is really worth protecting…
Blacksmith	Oh, our Fish is back! He's really back! Ha…..
Blacksmith	Don't worry boys.  I can fix it. / It'll fly like a bird again soon.
Captain B	Uh, this flower sure is pretty, huh?...Heh-heh…
Captain B	Ahhh...gift for you.
Captain B	Ah, gift for…hmmmm…
Blacksmith	(Laughing)
Captain B	uhhh…what are you laughing at?
Blacksmith	Relax, Romeo!
