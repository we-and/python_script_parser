(SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT "#LUVIZLUV)
(SEXUALITY IS FLUID)"
(Episode #104 Theme: COMMITMENT)



NOLA	Enough is enough. There are mad Toxins in my Life. I need a Break and some Radical Self-Care. And when I say Radical, I mean Radical. Treating myself to an Internal Cleanse that really gets the Stink out, you know? That means no Social Media, no Weed, no Alcohol, and no Men in my Lovin’ Bed. Ya heard? That's right fellas, there will be no penis between us. NO MEN. Nada. None. Zero. Not even Virtual.Oh, you don't believe I can do it? You wanna bet? But that don’t mean I can’t still smash though.


OPAL	I met Nola what, 2 years ago now. Right here in my Nursery. She didn’t buy anything that day, bur really good energy with her. Smart, Gorgeous, plus she’s an Artist and Shit. How can you not be attracted to that? Things were growing between us and then we Hit that point where you’re Exclusive or you’re Done. And Nola Benched me. Actually, it was more of a Slow Ghost, a Fade to Friend Zone then out. I didn’t think that she’d step back into my Life. But suddenly I am back in her Lovin’ Bed and it’s On and Poppin’. Now, I’m not trying to Catch any Feelings since I got burned the last time but I’m Single so might as well ride the Wave...





NOLA	You think Sky would be into this?

OPAL	That’s totally Skylar.

NOLA	I’d offer to get it for her but money is tight.

OPAL	A young Artist living in Fort Greene low on Cash? I don’t believe you.

NOLA	How bout this Bookmark? Since it’s Free 99... Had to start that teaching Artist gig tomorrow wich is great 'cause even with all my other side hustles, my rent is still mad late! I also applied for the Catlett Prize, so... So I'm just waiting to hear back. Money is coming, Money is coming, Money is coming.

OPAL AND NOLA	Money is Coming, Money is Coming...

OPAL	Plastic is coming, plastic is coming, money is coming. Isn’t the Group Show you’re in going up soon? How are you feeling about it?

MAN	Good morning Opal.

OPAL	Good morning.

NOLA	I don’t know. My Work is my solace these days, but I still feel like something hasn’t quite clicked.... Like I’ve been painting a lot of portraits which isn’t inherently groundbreaking. But you look at the work of LaToya Ruby Frazier, Kerry James Marshall, Mickalene Thomas, or even my boy Terrell Boyce... and they all have this fresh take on Portraiture. They’re Honest and unafraid of the Beauty of the Black Body and how it can be represented. And then, then they have the right theoretical language for their Art to Fly... I’m just trying to reach that same Sweet Spot with my work, you know?

OPAL	Do you wanna come over for dinner tonight?

NOLA	Like, tonight tonight?

OPAL	We can pick Skylar up from Rock Climbing after I close up shop and I’ll cook Dinner at my place.

NOLA	I Love it but I have Therapy and... oh, I have that thing with Terrell that I can’t bail on... I’m just trying to stick to what I say I’m gonna do.

OPAL	Well, you’re always welcome. Any time you’re Free. Okay, alright your pouty face please stop... it's just too cute.

NOLA	You are so dope.

OPAL	Watch that.

NOLA	I got to go. Can I give this to Sky?

OPAL	Yeah.

NOLA	See you!

OPAL	Like wouldn’t wanna be you?

NOLA	No, Silly. Soon. Like super soon!

OPAL	Can I help you with something, Sir?

NOLA	This Woman is like Whoa. I am legit feeling her. I feel so Safe. You know I don’t believe in Labels but as a Sex Positive Polyamorous Pansexual, words like Monogamy and Family have never even seemed like a remote possibility. But she owns her own nursery. She’s a Horticulturalist. It's so Hot, right? I can talk about work with her. My Parents, my parents would Love her. And she has a kid already from a Turkey Baster with a Friend from College, so I get Insta- Daughter without Labor pains or Stretch Marks! I can see the Three of us skipping down the Street holding hands like we’re in some Commercial for a product only White Folks would buy. And the Key is that unlike the Men I’ve been dealing with, she is not trying to own me. And that's real Talk.

DR. JAMISON	“Real Talk.” That’s what we’re aiming for at all times in here. Right.

NOLA	Right. And her Ego isn’t massive so I just have space to be myself. I'm sorry, am I gushing too much?

DR. JAMISON	No, no, it’s Great, these passionate feelings, it's great. Are you more at Home with an Intimate Partner of the same Sex?

NOLA	I don’t think about it like that. It’s more whether or not I’m into the Person.

DR. JAMISON	Well you seem to be more Open and at Ease having rekindled this particular relationship.

NOLA	I am. And the tools you suggested have been helping. Deep breathing, wearing that dress, visualizing safe spaces... and I feel like, you know, I've needed them all because I've just been attacked from all sides. But with Opal I don’t have to fight back all the time. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you... Do you have any tissues?, Oh, I ain't never see these. Oh gosh, I barely know what is going on.

DR. JAMISON	Well, we’ll pause here until next time.

NOLA	Okay

DR. JAMISON	How did you want to Pay Today, Cash or Check?

NOLA	So I was hoping I could open up a tab or something? Well I see you have great taste in Art. Maybe I could paint you a portrait.

DR. JAMISON	Let me think about that.

NOLA	Barter.




TERRELL	Do not make me break a Sweat!

NOLA	I did not realise how much I needed to Get Down! Terrell, do you feel that Beat? This DJ is fire!

TERRELL	I still have to introduce you to my Parents.

NOLA	Okay.

TERRELL	Let’s go over now. Nola comme on with your drunk ass.

NOLA	No!

TERRELL	Come on.

NOLA	No! Tarrell.

TERRELL	You look Beautiful Mama.

VILMA	Hello Son.

TERRELL	Congratulations Dad.

GEORGE	Thanks.

NOLA	Congratulations!

GEORGE / VILMA	Thank you.

GEORGE	You work for the City like I did, you can pay for a Retirement Party like this.

TERRELL	I’m doing just fine with my Art.

GEORGE	That's to be determined. And who is this Lovely Creature?

TERRELL	These are my Parents, George and Vilma.

NOLA	Hi! I’m Nola Darling. Nice to meet you.

TERRELL	Nola is my new Girlfriend.

VILMA	She’s very pretty.

NOLA	I’m not his Girlfriend.

TERRELL	That’s what she thinks.

NOLA	But we are Close.

TERRELL	True.

NOLA	How did you know you were right for each other?

VILMA	After we met it was clear as day we'd be Marrying.

NOLA	So you disappear and leave me inside alone with your Parents. To Dance? Areyou kidding me? Weren't we just dancing inside? Hey Stefano.

STEFANO	Ciao, Nola.

TERRELL	What is that in your hand? I thought you had to be up early for work.

NOLA	Doesn’t matter. It’s just a day job.

TERRELL	I thought you weren’t drinking right now.

NOLA	I had to! Otherwise your parents would think I was an Alcoholic.

STEFANO	And she had Rum Cake too.

TERRELL	After a few minutes with them I feel like I’m going to Choke. My Father has no respect for what I do. My Art.

NOLA	At least he knows you’re an Artist. But I can't believe you straight up lied and said I was your Girlfriend. Would you please tell this Fiancé of yours that he needs to be a Grown Ass Man and come out to his Parents? Why are you hiding all this?

TERRELL	Okay clearly I need to reach you. Class Bell. Ding, ding. My Parents? Old School Trini people. What’s worse than having Great Gallery Representation and a Residency at the Studio Museum and Collectors? Being a Batty Boy! And a Batty Boy like me gets disowned if he survives at all. You have some nerve telling me to be a Grown Ass Man when you're out here dating Three Guys and a Woman and you go into Anaphylactic Shock just hearing the word Commitment. See? You can only be a Fake Girlfriend, not a real one.

NOLA	So what? I have to be a Good Girl and get married off to count in your Book? That's ridiculous. Besides, I’m not Dating Three Men.

TERRELL	Well, well not tonight. Because you’re on a “Cleanse.”

NOLA	I’m doing what makes me Feel Good and that’s Opal right now.

TERRELL	You’re too Greedy, you can not stick to one thing for long.

NOLA	Hey Papo!

PAPO	Nola!

NOLA	Got my first day of teaching tomorrow.

PAPO	(subtitle)Educación (Education)

NOLA	I don’t want to Wake my parents Up.

PAPO	Listen, they don't want you staying out in the street tonight either.

NOLA	I know but, I’m an Adult though, right? I can figure something out.

PAPO	Yo Mamí, we could all use some help, okay?

NOLA	I like this Piece so much.

PAPO	You like that? Take it, it's yours.

NOLA	I only got Ten Dollars out. I owe you ten?

PAPO	Ten is good, ten is good. Listen, I haven't sell a piece in a minute so this is good, you know.

NOLA	I wish I could give you more.

PAPO	Nah, don't sweat it, you know. I worked on that all night, yo.

NOLA	You were the Best Artist in our School. The Best. The GOAT. Numero Uno.

PAPO	Gracias, mi Morena. (Thank you, my Morena) Pero Ese Vida No Pareció En Mis Cartas. Yo My Mama, she always used to say it wasn’t in the Cards. Wasn’t in the Cards.

NOLA	Papo, you should go get some food, I can take it from here. Shemekka, Shemekka, pick up...

ALL	Hi / Hey Winny.

WINNY WIN	Man, fuck that. That last shift was weak as shit. Wasn't no money nowhere in the fucking club. If I don't make no fucking money, you don't make no money. Now, I've been winning around the world, and you motherfuckers got me loosing right now. I don't give a fuck about you, I'd throw right in the street. You think I'd give a fuck? I throw you right in the street, and it's cold out there and shit. Shemekka, you know better than this shit.

SHEMEKKA	I know.

WINNY WIN	Don't you know better than shit?

SHEMMEKA	Yes, Win.

WINNY WIN	So what the fuck is wrong with you? I ain't got no favorites yet, if we don't make no money, fuck everybody. Get back to that shit or something, man. I'ma sit right in the front with Scissors. Eddie Scissors. Right in the front. You ain't shaking your ass, you going to the street. They don't give a fuck about shit in this motherfu... Get some money.

NOLA	Clo? Oh, are you having Sex? That’s Great. Oh, I’m locked out but you’re busy right now so it's fine.

DANTON	Hang up the phone.

CLORINDA	Why don't you call one of your Dick-Ma- Tists instead!

NOLA	I’m actually not dealing with any Penis right now, so... Hello? Hello?

OPAL	I thought you were with some Boy tonight.

NOLA	I told you I’m on a Man Break. Besides, I was with my boy Terrell and he’s Gay to the G, so.

OPAL	Well he could be playing for both Teams like you. I get very intolerant of the Bi-curious this late at night. Would you please take your Heels off so you don’t Wake Up Skylar?

NOLA	I will gladly take my heels off. The dogs are barking.

OPAL	What is that? It smells like Hot Trash.

NOLA	Oh. An old Schoolmate sold that to me. So Talented, so Homeless. We call him the Mayor of Fort Greene. If you ever catch me selling my Artwork on the Street, please like, give me a good slap or something. I got to get to my Apartment before Class tomorrow for my Lesson Plan.

OPAL	I keep Farmer’s hours, I'm up with the Sun. I’ll wake you. The Bathroom is here, you can wash up. Here’s a Towel.

NOLA	It’s Hello Kitty? I Love Hello Kitty. I am a towel, I make you feel Clean!

OPAL	Get in there, I’ll be in the living room. Good morning Sky.

SKYLAR	Good morning.

OPAL	Do you remember my Friend Nola?

SKYLAR	Possibly. Are you Mommy’s new Girlfriend? 'Cause she only lets Women stay over if it’s serious.

OPAL	You need to show your manners and say Hello before you start any Interrogations.

SKYLAR	Hi.

NOLA	Hi Skylar. Water.

SKYLAR	Mommy likes to go for a Run in the morning when there’s someone to keep an Eye on me. Wanna go running Mommy? Nola and I can make Breakfast.

OPAL	That’s very considerate of you. You sure you have time to eat and walk with us before work?

NOLA	Sure! It's like three hours. Plenty of time.

OPAL	You really want to be here alone with Sky while I Run?

NOLA	If that’s what she wants.

SKYLAR	That’s why I suggested it.

OPAL	Well alright then. Have Fun. Call me if you need me.

NOLA	Will do. Alright, so what are we making today?

SKYLAR	Oatmeal. Vegan.

OPAL	And you better behave.

SKYLAR	My Mother, however, starts her Day by eating the unborn eggs of Caged Birds. She can make those herself.

NOLA	What made you go Vegan?

SKYLAR	It was an easy Commitment. I just didn’t want to eat anything that runs away from me. Did you measure the Oatmeal water?

NOLA	Nah, with Oatmeal I do it by feel.

SKYLAR	That was a rhyme.

NOLA	Was it? I got more in me if you give me some time.

SKYLAR	I remember you.

NOLA	Yeah? I remember you.

OPAL	Skylar?

SKYLAR	Coming, Mommy.

OPAL	Nice Birks.

NOLA	Oh right, you don’t mind if I borrow them?

OPAL	No, it's fine. You got your lunch?

SKYLAR	Check

OPAL	Math Homework?

SKYLAR	Check.

NOLA	So this is what mornings are like in the Gilstrap household?

OPAL	Basically.

NOLA	Okay.

SKYLAR	Nola, will you come over again tonight? Before my Bedtime?

NOLA	Absolutely. You know what? We can make Dream Catchers!

OPAL	Come on, stop it. You made her happy.

NOLA	Why are you the ideal Woman? And how weird is it that I’m actually spending the morning with someone I’m Dating? You know I never do that, right?

GREER	Nola Darling.

NOLA	Greer?

OPAL	Opal.

GREER	Opal.

NOLA	Greer this is Opal. Opal this is Greer.

OPAL	I got that.

NOLA	What are you doing in Fo-Gre?

GREER	Training one of my clients. She likes the way I look so she wanted the regimen for herself. You know it's a real treat to see you here, Nola.

OPAL	I gotta go talk to Gardell.

GREER	So how long is this break of yours going to last? Okay, I know you got mad after the impromptu Photo Shoot. So hey, how ‘bout some Angry Morning make up Sex? With a safe word, shit can get Pretty Wild.

NOLA	What am I doing? I will let you know when I’m ready to see you.

GREER	You do that, babe. Stay Fine. Nola! Looking good in those Birks!

NOLA	That was unexpected.

OPAL	Yup. It felt like you were ashamed of me.

NOLA	Well I'm not.

OPAL	Look, you get to be a Tri-Sexual and try anything. It’s different when you’re like me and you don’t have a choice. But if you don’t want to be seen with a Woman by of one of your Dudes, I get it.

NOLA	It’s not Personal. And it’s not Anti-Political. I just don’t put my Loving Bed out in the Street.

OPAL	You still going to try to get into your Apartment?

NOLA	No try, do.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	You know class, as the great Barack Obama once said, the future rewards those who press on. So if you find yourself in a situation where...

NOLA	Hey everybody! Are you Miss Raqueletta Moss?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Raqueletta Moss is present. And on time. But Miss Nola Darling is sixteen minutes late.

NOLA	What? I thought class started at nine fifteen.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Is that what you thought? How artistic of you. We start at nine am sharp and it is now nine sixteen. Nope. Seventeen.

REGGIE	She mad late, y’all!

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Alright. But because Studies show that any sort of Arts exposure is very good at increasing Attendance, Morale, and Test Scores in all Subjects, and because our Motto is...

RAQUEL.STUDENTS		“With Love, Compassion and Discipline: We. Expect. Success!”

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Raqueletta Moss is going to reach into her pocket of generosity and let Nola Darling teach with the knowledge that this tardy behavior will never. Happen. Again. You have your Lesson Plan? Begin. Raqueletta Moss out.

NOLA	Who needs a Lesson Plan, right? Let’s just Flow today. How many of you have ever been late before? Nobody. Okay, how ‘bout any Friends, Siblings? No one makes mistakes here. Got it. In that case, what would a World without mistakes look like? What Shapes and Colors would it have? Who want's to show me? What's your name?

REGGIE	Regina Walters, but people call me Reggie.

NOLA	Nice to meet you Reggie. Come on up here.

REGGIE	You want me to draw on the Chalkboard?

NOLA	No. Draw on me.

REGGIE	Can I draw on your Hair?



NOLA	And then we made these found object Sculptures from whatever we could scavenge in the Classroom. It was awesome.

SEPTIMA	I’m impressed you made it through your First Day after your late start and the Key debacle. But you really should have rung the doorbell last night.

NOLA	I'm just trying to grow up, Mom.

SEPTIMA	Well put this around your Neck or something.


NOLA	Hey Miss Ella.

ELLA	You lost your Keys again?

NOLA	I'm so sorry for calling so late last night.

ELLA	Sit on my stoop, girl.

NOLA	I got my Spare Set from my Moms, though.

ELLA	That's good ‘cause I wasn't gonna replace them for the Third time. And where’s your Rent pray tell? It’s Two and a Half Weeks late.

NOLA	My Student Loan deferment ended so now I'm bringing in less Money every month now.

ELLA	I said Rent, not deferment. Rent. I’m already cutting you a deal because Septima and Stokes and I go way back.

NOLA	I know, I’m working on it.

ELLA	I could be getting three times from these white folks from what I'm charging you. What are your Parents’ getting?

NOLA	I never asked them.

ELLA	Just don’t make me have to harangue you. It messes up my Yoga.

NOLA	I’ll Pay you as soon as I get my check from Teaching. I Promise you.

ELLA	I try not to make promises I can’t keep.

NOLA	Well Miss Ella, I promise, I promise I will get you your rent on time. I'll get you your money.


NOLA	Supreme God, I give thanks. God of Earth, Father, Baba of the cross roads, may your blessings reach upon my life, may you remove all negative obstacles from my path with you divine wisdom. May it be so, Mother, Goddess of sweet river water, of abundance, love, light and creativity, may the sweetness of your honey flow in my life. I give praise to you, AO-Shun, who descends from heaven as a messenger of God on Earth. I say yo. Ahhh! Yes, yes, yes! Thank you God! I was up painting and I lost track of time. Is Skylar still up?

OPAL	She made you Vegan Cookies. But she fell asleep, I had to put her to bed.

NOLA	I am so sorry. You know I was late for school today too. I am fully jacking up my Life today with the CPT.

OPAL	Being late is one thing, forgetting People are there is another.

NOLA	I hear you. Opal, I want to try committing to you. Isn’t that the only way to learn how to do it?

OPAL	I was your Age when I had Sky. I was young but I was sure I wanted to be a Mom. And you, you’re not sure about anything. And I’m drawn to you because you have this Energy that I had before Sky came along. And I don’t want you to be anyone but yourself. But do not make promises to me that we know you can’t keep.

NOLA	I made it into the Second Round for the Catlett Prize.

OPAL	That’s wonderful. You deserve it.

NOLA	Would you give this to Skylar for me, please? You both inspired me today.

OPAL	We can stay in touch as Friends, but... I am going to have to think long and hard about whether we can be anything more.

NOLA	Will you still come to the Group Show?

OPAL	I don't know. Oh. Here are your heels, and the Painting you left behind.

NOLA	Thanks. Oh, here, let me give you your Birks.

OPAL	No, keep them, they look good on you. Goodnight.

NOLA	Goodnight. I’m learning.
