NOVA	Previously on Queen Sugar...	
						
VIOLET	Welcome to Vi's Prized Pies and Diner!	
						
DARLA	Do you think that you could take Blue on one of my days next week? I have a date.				
RALPH ANGEL	Date?	
						
ROMERO	Micah's coming home tomorrow, and... I, I know it's a big deal to introduce me to him is all.	
						
NOVA	It's my book. It comes out soon, and I wanted you to have it.	
							
HOLLYWOOD	Something ain't right about that book.	
								
NOVA	Hollywood...	
								
FEMALE REPORTER	I've read an advanced copy of your sister's memoir.	
								
CHARLEY	Promise me! Do not read it.	
								
NOVA	Give me the strength to see this through.	
								
RALPH ANGEL	Just got Blue back in bed.	
				
CHARLEY	You read it?	
				
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah, I read the chapter about Blue. I ain't readin' nothin' else. How she gonna do me that,	 Charley? Wrote about my son? Prison? Makin' me sound like some good for nothin’ convict.	 Too stupid to know his kid ain’t his. And every time I try and get up in life, somebody gonna drop a weight on me.	
								
CHARLEY	I am sorry this is happening. But I don’t want you to worry, Rah. I’ve got a plan. I’m making some calls. And after I've handle that, we’re all gonna go see Nova. Together. Make her look us in the eyes, and answer for what she’s done.	
				
				
		
 
RALPH ANGEL	She wrote about Blue. How she gonna do that to him? To me?	
			
CHARLEY	Ralph Angel... I've got you.	
						
JIMMY DALE	Try it again, ma’am.	
			
FEMALE DRIVER #1	It worked! Oh, thank you so much! 
			
JIMMY DALE	Ain’t no thang at all. Why, my momma would	have came down from heaven and snatch me to	 death, if she thought I rode past a lady in need.	
			
FEMALE DRIVER #1	Don’t know how long I would have been here if you hadn’t come along. You sure have a way with an engine.	
			
JIMMY DALE	I've been repairin' engines since I was	knee-high to a toadstool. My daddy told me, he	 said, "You can't drive the car till you know how to fix the car." Had me fixin' all his friends' cars	 for free. I said, "Wait a minute now. This is unjust! I'm bein' used." You know what my daddy said? He said "Son, if you ain't bein' used, you useless."	
			
FEMALE DRIVER #1	Mm-mm. Mm-hmm.	 Sound like your daddy was a wise man. And he raised you right. You live around	here?	
			
JIMMY DALE	Nah, I’m just passin’ through. Checkin’ on a old friend. You be safe on this road, ma'am.	
			
FEMALE DRIVER #1	Thank you.	
			
VIOLET	All right, fellows! You all take good care of yourself out there. First day of harvest will try to	 break you to the bone. Don’t you let it.	
						
MALE CUSTOMER #1	Mm-hmm.	
			
MALE CUSTOMER #2	I'll think about it. Yeah. Let's get up out of here.	
				
VIOLET	Rhonda, have you seen Hollywood?	
			
RHONDA	Think I saw him in the back. Said somethin' about doin' inventory.	
						
VIOLET	Hey!	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Hi. What?	
			
VIOLET	I got five tables waiting on orders and no one workin' the cash register, and you’re here?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Look, I'm sorry, I just lost track of time.	
			
VIOLET	No, we don’t need no inventory reports, I need hands delivering plates to hungry mouths.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	I’m comin’, I’m comin’.	
			
IGNACIO	And that leaves us till Friday. We should be done with section one by the end of the week.	 That timeline good for you? Boss?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good, Ignacio.	
			
MALE WORKER #1	Alright. Like that.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Might be a little while. Got some stuff to hand off in N’awlins.	
			
IGNACIO	No problem.	
			
BLUE	Pop!	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Watch them shoelaces. Don't want you to fall. Come on.	
						
BLUE	You okay, Pop? Got a look.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	What kind of look? I don't look like that.	
			
BLUE	You do.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Uh-un.	
			
BLUE	What?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Come here. Hold on for a second.	
			
BLUE	What?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	No matter what nobody tell you, you know I love you, right? Just remember that, a'ight?	
			
BLUE	Okay. I love you too, Pops.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	A'ight.	
			
BLUE	We gotta go.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	All right.	
						
NOVA	One second, Michelle! Rah? Um, what’s goin’	on? First, just tell me. Did you read the entire book?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah, I read enough. "Mysteries in Blue?" See, I’m tryin’, Nova, just to understand why you’d somethin' like this.	
			
NOVA	I know it’s a shock seeing it laid out like that, but just try and take a step back.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Step back from what? My own life? How that work?	
			
NOVA	This story is gonna help so many people--	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I don’t give a damn about "so many people," Nova! And my life ain't no story! I care	 about my son. You know what I been through, Nova. Come on. You was right there when I got	 the paternity test. This one time, I actually thought you was there for me.	
			
NOVA	I was there for you. I am now.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Nah, you just needed somethin’ juicy for that	little book of yours.	
			
NOVA	It's, it’s not one or the other, Rah. I can still be your sister who loves you. And a writer searching for truth.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I ain’t your research, Nova. I’m your baby brother.	
			
NOVA	Were you never gonna tell Blue that you aren’t his biological father?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	That's my son! That ain’t your call!	
			
NOVA	Yes, he’s your son. That’s my point. We all need to understand that. You said it yourself. It don’t	 change nothin’. Remember?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Usin' my words against me, huh?	
			
NOVA	Rah, and I say this with	 love, you’re acting like you’re the first person who’s raising a child that ain’t their own blood.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	You got some nerve, Nova. What’s gonna happen to Blue when he go to school now?	
			
NOVA	Nothing.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Oh, yeah. You put this out there. Somebody gonna say somethin'. Yeah, he gonna hear somethin'.	
			
NOVA	I didn’t come to you before. I should have. Sorry. Honestly, the book became something larger	than me. If you want, I can sit down with you and Blue, explain it to him.	
						
RALPH ANGEL	If we ain’t had the same Momma and Daddy, I’d call you the son of a bitch you acting like right now.	
			
MICHELLE	Hey, superstar! Sorry we’re late. You can set up in the office. Let’s start in there. Nova, go with Seekie, she’ll take care of you. Oh, hello. And you are?	
			
NOVA	Michelle, this is my brother.	
			
MICHELLE	The famous Ralph Angel? Your story is so heartbreaking, I cried twice.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Don’t you ever go nowhere near my son again. You lost that right, superstar.	
			
			
MICHELLE	Nova, just relax your jaw. Think excited for your book. Can we take five? Let’s	take five.	
			
NOVA	How far along are we? In, uh, publication.	
			
MICHELLE	We’re two weeks out, so I’d say we’re	 pretty far along. Why?	
			
NOVA	There's just a few chapters that I’d like to go over. Uh, rework, maybe.	
			
MICHELLE	I love your book. I wouldn’t change a thing. This wouldn’t have anything to do with why your brother was here?	
			
NOVA	My family is having trouble with the book. I just need some more time to smooth things out before the book tour.	
			
MICHELLE	I see this all the time, you know? When an author becomes successful. Not everyone can	 come along for the ride, so to speak.	
			
NOVA	They’re not "everyone." They’re my family.	
			
MICHELLE	This book is going to reach a lot of people and	 take you far. And it’s too late to stop the presses, anyway.	
			
CHARLEY	If you'd had waited like I said--	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I had to let her know.	
			
CHARLEY	And now you’ve removed the element of surprise. Which is crucial to how I’m trying to	 stop this book. I’m just as angry as you are, but bein' a hothead won’t always solve--	
			
RALPH ANGEL	What’s that supposed to mean, Charley? Huh?	
			
FEMALE SINGER #1	 (singing) 
					
CHARLEY	Has Aunt Vi read it?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	No, I don’t think she should.	
			
CHARLEY	She needs to know what Nova wrote about her. We have to sit her down.	
			
VIOLET	Sit who down?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Uh, some kid at Blue's school botherin' him. That's all.	
			
VIOLET	Oh, well, give me the momma’s number. I’ll straighten that out real quick.	
			
CHARLEY	The new floors are looking good, Aunt Vi.	
			
VIOLET	I like 'em too, baby.	
			
	
			
	
			
	
			
CHARLEY	We have to say	 something before Nova gets to her.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	No. I’ll do it. Y’all too fired up. She don’t need	all that upsetting energy.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	She gonna be upset either way. When she find out what Nova wrote about her, Nova gonna wish she was never born.	 Gotta get Blue to this birthday party.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	I'mma holler at you later, baby.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I'll see you.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	So has he read the whole book?	
			
CHARLEY	I don’t think so.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	So he don’t know that Darla in that too? And that chapter broke me down. Why would Nova	 put all that in there? The night that I found Darla and Blue while Rah was locked up? That’s a	 story that should never be told. I cannot believe that Nova would do that to all of us. Aren't you gonna tell him?	
			
CHARLEY	No, because that book will never see the light of day.	
			
DARLA	Can you drop Blue off	 tonight an hour later?	
						
RALPH ANGEL	I'll bring him by later.	
			
DARLA	Thank you.	
						
RALPH ANGEL	All right. Talk to you later. Bye.	
			
DARLA	Bye.	
			
BLUE	Pop?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	All right. I'm-- All right. Sorry. All right.	
			
BLUE	Marcus is there, can I go give him his present?	
						
RALPH ANGEL	It's all you.	
			
BLUE	Thank you.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Oh! Oh! Hold up!	
			
BLUE	What? What?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Have fun. I’ll be back to get you later.	
			
BLUE	I will. Bye.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	All right. All right.	
			
JOIE	Hey, Blue!	
			
BLUE	Joie? You know Marcus?	
			
JOIE	Yeah, he’s on my soccer team.	
			
FEMALE ATTENDANT	All right, kids, gather round!	
			
JOIE	Let’s go, Blue!	
			
FEMALE ATTENDANT	Come on! Let's get this party started!	
			
BLUE	Bye, Pop! Miss you.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	All right.	
			
DEESHA	Hello there, stranger.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	How you doin'?	
			
DEESHA	I'm good. Joie and I were actually just talkin' about you boys.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah?	
			
DEESHA	She wants to have a playdate with Blue.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	And this don't count?	
			
DEESHA	Knowing Joie, probably not.	
						
RALPH ANGEL	Fair enough.	
			
DEESHA	But at least we've got a break for a couple of hours. That doesn’t happen every day.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Sure don’t.	
			
DEESHA	You wanna take a walk?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Come on.	
			
CHARLEY	And that could buy us some more time? Great. If you could just, uh, send me over a draft, I can take a look at it over tonight. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Olivia.	
			
FEMALE PSA	Flight Thirty-seven to Atlanta, Georgia is now boarding. Flight Thirty-seven to Atlanta...	
						
MICAH	Mom!	
			
FEMALE PSA #1	Ladies and gentlemen...	
					
MICAH	What's up? Mm. You know, feels good to be home.	
			
FEMALE FAN #1	Micha? Micah West? Can we get a selfie?	
			
MICAH	Yeah.	
			
FEMALE FAN #1	Cool.	
			
MICAH	What's up?	
						
FEMALE FAN #1	Thank you.	
			
MICAH	Peace. Weren't they supposed to bring your car around by now? Would've got it faster at the regular	 airport valet.	
			
CHARLEY	Micah, your fabulous European vacation, your fans clamoring for you upon your arrival, your 	father chartering you a private plane for a missed connection in New York. I don’t want you	 getting used to this.	
			
FEMALE PSA #1	PSA...	
			
MICAH	I know, Ma.	
						
FEMALE PSA #1	Simmons to gate twelve.	 Mister and Missus Simmons to gate twelve.	
			
CHARLEY	But when you said "Paris was transformative," I didn’t think you meant literally.				
MICAH	Did you hate the look?	
			
CHARLEY	No. No, I don’t hate the look. I, I’m surprised.	
			
MICAH	Well, I... I started growing my hair out and I bought some new clothes. It’s not a big deal.	 And besides, I don’t want you talking me out of it.	
						
CHARLEY	A heads up would have been nice.	
			
MICAH	Just trying something new. Like you did.	
			
CHARLEY	Me?	
			
MICAH	Yeah. Yeah, you stopped straightening your hair. Been keepin' it natural.	
			
CHARLEY	Keke happy you’re home?	
			
MICAH	Yes. Yeah, I’m seeing her later. I’m just texting Aunt Nova. Oh, wait. She’s callin' me. Hey, Aunt Nova. Yes! Paris was incredible. I met up with your friend from, uh, Amnesty International. Took some amazing seminars. Thank you. Um,	 Aunt Nova wants to talk to you real quick.	
			
MALE VALET #1	Ms. Bordelon?	
			
CHARLEY	Uh. I’ll talk to her later. When we’re home. Thank you. Come on.	
			
MICAH	She said she's gonna call you later.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	All right.	
			
FEMALE SINGER #3	 (singing)
				
VIOLET	So what was all that about earlier?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	What?	
			
VIOLET	I know when somebody's lying to me. You, Charley, Ralph Angel all huddled up, hushed tones.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Baby, that wasn't nothin’. I was halfway listening to myself. You know them two. They always at and about somethin'.	
			
VIOLET	Really? So, what’s the somethin'?	
			
HOLLYWOOD	Some farm stuff. Look, it ain't was none of my	 business. Babe, I’m about to put these desserts in	 so these folks get some of that good pie. All right?	
						
NOVA	Hey, you free right now?	
						
MALIK	Nah, I mean, look at you, man. Like, you had to go all the way to France to get Black?	
			
MICAH	Come on, man, I don’t look that different.	
			
KJ	Surprised you ain’t post your new look on Instagram yet.	
			
MICAH	Yeah, no, man, I had to get off social media. Ever since my prison speech, I’ve been getting	 hate from these trolls, man. Had to take a break.	
			
ASHA	I'm sorry about that, man. That really sucks.	
			
KJ	Pfft!	
			
MALIK	Yeah, I bet it sucked being in Paris all summer. Meeting celebrities.	
						
MICAH	And activists. Yo, I went to the, um, Young Groundbreakers Conference. Met a lot of dope	 people, lot of young activists like us. They’ve been doing some dope stuff. How was your summer?	
			
KJ	Fine. Tried to hang out with Ant as much as possible before he went to juvie.	
			
ASHA	But it's like now we can’t even visit him. Because it's family only.	
			
MICAH	Man, I can’t believe he’s gonna miss the last first football game of the season.	
			
MALIK	Yeah, we’re just gonna have to enjoy on his behalf. Yeah? Uh-oh! Oh! Ooh! Uh-uh!	
						
KEKE	Hey, y'all.	
			
MALIK	Uh-uh! Aye! Aye! (singing) » Here she come Uh uh uh Here she come Aye aye aye Here she come Aye aye « 
						
MICAH	Hello. Missed you.	
						
MALIK	Okay, should we leave y’all alone? Or...	
			
MICAH	Cool.	
						
DEESHA	I don’t know how you do it. I mean, I grew up on a farm. I had dirt in my shoes.	
RALPH ANGEL	Occupational hazard, huh?	
			
DEESHA	And in my hair. Mm-	 hmm. But you love it.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I could do with less dirt in my shoes, but yeah I do. I love it. Take it you ain’t followin' your daddy’s footsteps?	
							
DEESHA	Uh, well, I would but overalls aren’t very flattering.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Ah? The overall?	
			
DEESHA	Mm-hmm.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	So it ain't the wakin' up early in the mornin', bakin' in that sun?	
			
DEESHA	But that’s right. I based	 my entire career on a fashion choice.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Well, I’m sure you would look good in anything. So what you wear to work then, huh? Pajamas? Ball gowns?	
			
DEESHA	Well, I wish I could wear pajamas, but no, it’s just a suit. I’m a public defender. Don’t tell me you’re	 the kind of guy who can’t handle a woman who knows her way around an argument.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	You ain’t met my sisters yet.	
			
DEESHA	Oh?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah, I’m sure I could take you.	
			
DEESHA	Oh, can you?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Well, I-- I ain't mean it like that. I--	
			
DEESHA	Mm-hmm. Oh! Beignets! The reason I’ll never leave Louisiana. I’m buyin'.	
							
RID	So you got another ex-	boyfriend trinket you want me to sell?	
			
NOVA	I don’t just call you for thatI’m sorry. I just... It’s been a day. And I think I got a	lot more of 'em coming.	
			
RID	Hey, you know I got you. What you need?	
			
NOVA	Friend. Just a friend.	
						
RID	I could do that.	
			
NOVA	I wrote a book about my family.	
						
FEMALE CUSTOMER #1	Thank you.	
						
FEMALE YOUNG CHEF	What’s up, my man? What you want?	
			
MALE CUSTOMER #2	What you doing, Barry?	
			
JIMMY DALE	Well, what you got? You out here, got this asphalt smelling like my momma’s kitchen. Hit me with it.	
			
FEMALE YOUNG CHEF	A’ight, so I got, Honey Chipotle Ribs, Cajun Smoked Wings, and lemon pepper grilled	 shrimp. And the encore, banana pudding that'll make you disown your momma.	
			
JIMMY DALE	Well, let me try these ribs in to go plate. Whoo! Mm! You know what, I think in another life, you probably was somebody's grandma.	You sure you ain’t out here tryin' to cook like	 your fifty years old?	I'm gonna need to see some ID,	 young lady. I always like to support local businesses. You know, uh, I grew up hangin' on my momma’s	 apron strings in her restaurant. Matter of fact, I’m on my way to Louisiana to see somebody I used to know recently opened up they own restaurant. Well, maybe that could be you some day.	
			
FEMALE YOUNG CHEF	That’s the goal. And thank you for that. Be sure to tell all your friends to come through.	
			
JIMMY DALE	Oh, I'll do that!	
						
RALPH ANGEL	I feel good. Never had no massage before.	
			
DEESHA	Never?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Uh-un.	
			
DEESHA	Oh, you are missing out on one of life’s great,	simple pleasures.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Guess so.	
			
DEESHA	Relax. Just let it do what it does.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	I am relaxed.	
			
DEESHA	Oh, my God. If this is you relaxed, I’d hate to see you tense. Come on. Close your eyes, feel the rhythm.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	A'ight.	
			
DEESHA	Give in to it.	
						
RALPH ANGEL	Glad I ran into you.	
			
DEESHA	Yeah?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	So you think we could do this again?	
			
DEESHA	This?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Talkin' about you and me. No kids. Just us.	
			
DEESHA	I’d like that.	
						
DARLA	A bit bitter, that one.	
			
LEO	Really?	
			
DARLA	Mm-hmm. Unless you like some bite with your coffee?	
			
LEO	I just like coffee, period. It’s my saving grace. When I first got sober, I’d have injected caffeine in my arm if I could. Too much?	
			
DARLA	No, not at all. Uh, it's	 actually it's a relief to be	 able to joke about it. You know? Laughing is not a crime, people.	
			
LEO	Yeah, NA group can be, uh, pretty serious sometimes, but everybody’s got their process.	
			
DARLA	I mean, God. Six months ago, I don't think I could've laughed about much of anything. Sorry.	 We said no group talk on our first date.	
			
LEO	I know, but who are we fooling?	
			
DARLA	True.	
			
LEO	Hey, have you, uh, you given any more thought to bein' a sponsor?
		
DARLA	I haven’t decided yet.	
			
LEO	I think anyone would be lucky to have you as a sponsor. You been through the fire, you’re still here. Can even smile sometimes. 
			
DARLA	Thank you... For	 that. I, um-- I feel like I, um--	Like, I’ve just gotten to a... Good place.	
			
LEO	Yeah. I’ve been sober five years now. It, uh, took me twice as long to get to where you are. But, but, uh, we, we ain’t gotta talk about all that right now, ‘cause now, I think it’s time to get into this Italian dark roast. Mm. It’s just right.	
						
WAITRESS #1	Bye, Miss Vi.	
			
WAITER #1	Goodnight.	
			
VIOLET	Night, y'all. You and the kids were talkin’ about nothin’, huh? Just found "nothin’" stuffed on a shelf in	my office.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	You said you ain’t have time to read Nova’s book.	
			
VIOLET	So you took it upon yourself to read it for me? And I take it that that child then dug up every	 one of Ernest’s skeletons.	
			
HOLLYWOOD	No, this book ain’t just about Ernest. Vi, think	it’s time for you to read that book.				
WAITRESS #1	I take care of the business...	
				
ROMERO	Third time tonight.	
			
CHARLEY	It’s always been like this. Always on her schedule. "Consequence" is not a word in her vocabulary, apparently. Sorry, I’m	just venting.	
			
ROMERO	It’s okay. If someone wrote all the things I did in a book, I don't think I’d be handing it out to everyone I meet.	
			
CHARLEY	Mm. Sounds ominous. There something from your past I should know about?	
			
ROMERO	No. No. I just-- I just	 mean that there were a lot of causes that I was passionate about, and sometimes my passion didn’t always help. There are just some things that I wish I would have	 thought through more.	
			
CHARLEY	Hmm. Well, I spent the better part of the last two years moving on from the things she wrote about. When you read it--	
			
ROMERO	I won’t read it. I wanna get to know the you now, not you then.	
			
CHARLEY	Thank you. All I know is... I can’t have this. I can't.	
			
ROMERO	It sounds like you have to talk to her.	
			
CHARLEY	She never talked to me about it. And now it’s in print for anyone to read. This is defamation. Maybe even libel.	
			
ROMERO	Was it all a lie? I	 know you have to do something, but if you go down the legal road, you might just pay more	 attention to the book.	
			
CHARLEY	This whole thing’s a mess. I’m, I'm just trying to fix it.	
			
ROMERO	What if you can’t? What if this is just one of those things you have to live through?	
							
KEKE	There's so much stuff to do since you're back.	What do you wanna do?	
						
MICAH	I'm happy to be back.	
			
KEKE	What's up? I'm just kidding.	
			
MICAH	You fake turned it?	
			
KEKE	You know what, yeah--	
			
MICAH	Yo, watch it. Watch it.	
			
BEAU	Hey, almost didn’t recognize you there, Micah. Looks like someone watched Black Panther too many times.	
			
BEAU'S FRIEND	That is so true!	
			
MICAH	Hey, what did you say, bro? Hey, what did you say?	
			
BEAU'S FRIEND	Kick him out!	
						
MICAH	Oh, so I’m funny to you now?	
			
BEAU	Yeah.	
						
KEKE	Whoa! Hey! Micah, no, no, no, no, no, no! Micah--	
			
DARLA	See you soon.	
			
LEO	I could see you inside.	
			
DARLA	I need to take things slow. You understand, right?	
			
LEO	I understand. And I respect that. See you soon then. Real soon, I hope.	
			
MICAH	Uh, he bumped me, on purpose, didn’t apologize, makes a joke about Black culture.	 And I’m supposed to be like, "No worries?" You know, guys like Beau grow up to be men like	 Orson. Orson wasn’t born that way. Before he	 started abusing us, he got used to laughing at us. That’s the first step.	
			
NOVA	What is?	
			
MICAH	I went to one of those seminars you told me about this summer. Read a lot of Homi Bhabha,	 some others. But I learned that the first step to	 taking a people’s stuff, to taking their land, their bodies, is to take down their culture. To laugh at it.				
NOVA	Yes. "The comic turn." I remember.	
			
MICAH	Well, if someone had popped Orson in the mouth, maybe he wouldn’t have put a gun in	 mine. You know, zero tolerance. That’s my new policy.	
			
NOVA	I want you to be the first person to have a hard copy of my book.	
			
MICAH	Wow. Wow, this is an honor. Can you sign it for me?	
						
NOVA	Already done.	
			
MICAH	What? "Now for moments of doubt, remember we have wings. With love, Aunt Nova." Thank you.	
						
DARLA	He was so tired.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Yeah.	
			
DARLA	What? Is everything okay?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Just a crazy day. That's all.	
			
DARLA	You have a lot on your shoulders, Ralph Angel. You’re handling it though. I’m proud of you.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Appreciate it. How are you doing?	
			
DARLA	I’m, um, I’m feeling stable. And hopeful.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Hopeful about this guy you've been seeing?	
						
DARLA	Do you think that, uh, we should, um, be talking about these kinds of things?	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Why not? We’re co-parents, ain't we? They say it’s best we be friends. I mean, shit, you already	 told me you dating somebody.	
			
DARLA	I don’t think we should talk about these things because, because if I tell you about who I’m	 dating, then that means that I’d have to hear about who you’re dating. And I don't think I’m	 ready for that.	
			
RALPH ANGEL	Be honest. I don't think I'm ready either. But I wish you happiness, Darla. That I do.	
			
DARLA	As I do you.	
			
CHARLEY	Micah. Oh, my God.	
			
MICAH	I’m fine. It’s not a big deal.	
			
CHARLEY	Mm-mm. That’s not necessarily for you to decide. You can’t be getting into fights, Micah. You... You cannot. How you act and how you look matter. Why didn’t you tell me you were gonna lock your hair?	
			
MICAH	You didn't say anything about my hair last year.	
			
CHARLEY	A high top fade reads differently to most people.	
			
MICAH	And by most people you mean white people? I should live my life by making white people feel comfortable? Okay.	
			
CHARLEY	If wearing a belt on your pants or-or cutting your hair is a millisecond difference between you being dead or alive, that-that's a compromise I’m willing to live with.				
MICAH	I’m not! I’m not gonna twist myself into knots	 trying to fit into some box that doesn’t promise	 me a damn thing. No, I’mma do me.	
			
CHARLEY	Sounds like you learned a lot in your chat with Nova.	
			
MICAH	S-- This has nothing to do with Aunt Nova. You know the night I was in jail? After I got out, you	 know who it was who saw that I had pissed my pants because I was so scared? Tied her sweater around my waist so I wouldn’t be ashamed? Who wasn’t across the parking lot screaming at Dad? Who gave a damn that night about how I	 felt? Aunt Nova. Good night.	
			
CHARLEY	All right. Now I’m ready	 for you.	
			
NOVA	Okay. Let’s just sit down and ta-talk.	
			
CHARLEY	No. It was bad enough for you to print this trash for the world to see. But now your	 words have wormed their way into my son’s heart and poisoned him against me.	
			
NOVA	Charley, please. Micah came to me. He knew 	you’d be upset. He just needed someone to listen	 to him. And you always--	
			
CHARLEY	Mm. No, keep going. I always what? You certainly didn’t hold back in your book. What do you	 think about me, Nova? Well, actually, I already have an idea. "My sister, born to	 privilege, raised with wealth, and half bathed in whiteness, used her light-skin as her shield and her sword, weapons in every room she entered, every deal she made, with every woman she sacrificed, and for every man she protected. Her honey skin kept her safe, all the while keeping	her complicit in the continued oppression of	 Black bodies." Is this what you think of me?	
			
NOVA	I was writing about privilege.	
			
CHARLEY	You can shove your themes up your pretentious ass. Call it what you want, but this, this is three	 hundred pages of you telling the world how much you hate your only sister.	
			
NOVA	Charley, I love you.	
			
CHARLEY	This isn’t love! This is betrayal	disguised as pulp fiction trying to pass itself off	 as literature!	
			
NOVA	Almost everything in the book was public knowledge. So I wasn’t writing about Davis to be salacious. You and Davis present a	classic story about the insidious nature of rape culture.	
			
CHARLEY	Oh, my God. Are you out of your damn mind? Nova! We are people! I am your sister. I’m not some example to be used for your examination of rape culture!	
			
NOVA	I am writing about how women often protect	men instead of protecting other women. Which	 is what you did, Charley, and how we are blind to our own enabling of patriarchy. You’re hardly alone in this. That’s what I’m writing about.				
CHARLEY	Dress it up however you want but at the end of the day you wrote about your evil light skinned sister and her famous, philandering husband.	
			
NOVA	I’m laying myself bare in this book too. I admit what happened to Too Sweet was my fault. I	 sold weed to Rid when it was illegal and Too Sweet bore the burden of my callous actions. I	 have been complicit in a system that hurts young	 Black men.				
CHARLEY	Laying yourself bare and laying your family bare are two different things! You wrote about	 me, Rah. Nova, you wrote about Aunt Vi!	
			
NOVA	I’m writing about an American family.	
			
CHARLEY	No. When Micah reads this-- He trusts you. When he reads this, he’ll believe I’m a monster.	
			
NOVA	He won’t. I’ll explain it to him.	
			
CHARLEY	You have no idea what the consequences of this being in the world will be. You have to put the brakes on it.	
			
NOVA	I can’t, Charley. It’s gone to print. It’s too late.	
			
VIOLET	"We speak of strength in Black women almost like a superpower. An innate gift disconnected from growth, struggle, tears, pain, joy and-and brokenness. This is the lie. For sure,	 strength isn’t something you buy at the corner store. And my Aunt Violet is the proof. Her body and spirit, so strong now, was broken more times than she can count by my Uncle Jimmy Dale."	
			
VIOLET	No, she didn't.	
			
FEMALE CONCIERGE	Checking in, sir?	
			
JIMMY DALE	Yes. I am. I think I got turned around. Where’s	 that diner I heard so much about, used to be called the, uh, High Yellow?	
			
FEMALE CONCIERGE	That’s Vi’s Prized Pies now.	
			
JIMMY DALE	Vi’s Prized Pies. Yeah. I think I'll go over there tomorrow.	
			
FEMALE CONCIERGE	You won’t be sorry, their peach pecan pie is to die for. And may I have a name for the room?	
			
JIMMY DALE	Dale. Jimmy Dale.	
						
WOMAN'S VOICE	Go, Riri.
