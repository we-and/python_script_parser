Owen	She were a strict momma. But she was fair. And whenever we was in trouble, us boys, she would always... Well, that's interesting.

Steven	I'm sure it's nothing.

Celeste	Steven?! I think someone's out here!

Steven	What?!

Celeste	Someone's out here!

Steven	I can't hear you!

Celeste	Behind you! Oh, my god! Steven! Get up! Get up!

Owen	Well, well, well. Looks like Christmas came early this year, hm? I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "I heard about this sorta thing happening, "but I didn't think it would happen to little ol' me." Well, it has. But you're gonna be famous. You're gonna be on one of those Missing Persons posters. When they send it out, I'm putting it in my window. Not of your boyfriend 'cause he dead. But you, I'm keeping you alive. I got plans for you. And thusly, you and I should get intimately acquainted, don't you think? Hm? Excuse my hands, and they’re cold. Hm? You know what I'm looking for, huh? Found it. I'm impressed. Most girls, they try to scream and panic, not you. Celeste. What a beautiful name. And a great picture. I'm Owen. You already met my brother, Oswald. Quiet. A quiet, celestial being, hm? I like that. It's good. It's real good, 'cause around here, silence is golden. Well I really mean that. So you keep that tongue inside your head. You use it, you lose it. You know what you should be doing. Go on! I hate to leave you hanging here, but I got work to do.

Oswald	You wanna lay down?

Chris	So tell us what it's like to be 25.

Jenna	Why?

Chris	So you can look back at this when you're 50.

Taylor	Like she's gonna care.

Chris	Of course she's gonna care. 25 years from now, everyone's gonna be filming everything they do, okay? Trust me.

Mike	Why? Are they gonna be as bored as you? Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck. Jesus.

Chris	What is it?

Mike	It's the fucking radi, get that thing outta my face. Fuck.

Taylor	What's going on?

Chris	It's the radiator, I think.

Taylor	Great, just what we fucking need.

Mike	I'm gonna walk. Pretty sure there's a gas station up the road a few miles. Do you wanna walk with me?

Jenna	Do you need me to walk with you? 

Chris	Whoa. Where you going?

Mike	There's a gas station up that way. If they can't fix the car, at least they'll have a phone.

Taylor	Okay. What's going on? What happened last night?

Jenna	Mm, it's not just last night. He's been lying about where he's been the past few weeks.

Taylor	Some other chick?

Jenna	I don't know. All I know is, I bring it up, he shuts me down. Just wanna go home.

Taylor	All right, then, I'll go with him. Make sure it gets done quick.

Jenna	Okay.

Chris	Taylor. Where you going?

Taylor	To help Mike. Don't go wandering away. And lay off with the fucking camera. 

Oswald	? It's all right, don't you worry ? ? It's all right, don't you cry ? ? It's all right, don't you worry ? ? 'Cause Momma's still alive ?

Taylor	Hey!

Mike	What are you doing?

Taylor	Coming with you.

Mike	Why?

Taylor	'Cause I want to. It's just me. I told Chris to hang back with Jenna. And I told her there'd be no time wasted.

Chris	Hey, we got shit tickets if we need 'em.

Jenna	What?

Chris	Shit tickets. It's better than using leaves. How far out do you think we are?

Jenna	From home?

Chris	Yeah.

Jenna	About a hundred miles?

Chris	How long to walk that?

Jenna	Three miles an hour, about 33 hours.

Chris	So, like a day and a half?

Jenna	Without sleep, yeah.

Chris	No wonder I never go anywhere.

Jenna	Yeah, well, we should have stayed home last night.

Chris	You really didn't have a good time?

Jenna	For a guy who likes to videotape people at every moment, you're not very observant. Whoa. You can stay here.

Chris	But what if something happens to you?

Jenna	Nothing's gonna happen to me.

Chris	But what if it does?

Jenna	Then you'll be wiping your ass with leaves.

Taylor	Mike, your eyeballs are burning holes into my pockets.

Mike	Sure Jenna's not coming?

Taylor	She doesn't wanna talk to you. She knows you're lying to her.

Mike	She said that?

Taylor	Mm-hm.

Mike	What do you think?

Taylor	What I think is that your relationship's over. Has been for a while. So how far away is this gas station?

Mike	I don't know, another half hour or so.

Taylor	Good. And pull out this time. Last time, you didn't. The fuck was that?

Mike	What was what?

Taylor	No, didn't you hear that?

Mike	Wait, you think they're coming? Shit.

Taylor	I told you, they're not coming. And neither are we, apparently.

Mike	Let's just get to someone who has a phone, and who can fix my car.

Chris	Good times?

Jenna	It's weird, I tripped over a wire. And I found blood on a tree.

Chris	So?

Jenna	It was a hand print.

Chris	 A hunter could've gone hunting, killed a dear, got some blood on his hands, and just wiped it on the tree.

Jenna	It's not hunting season.

Mike	Aren't you worried that he's gonna find out?

Taylor	If I were you, I'd be more worried about Jenna finding out.

Mike	Yeah, but I'm not the one who's supposed to be her best friend.

Taylor	I'm not her best friend.

Mike	Come on, Taylor, you're the only girl she brought with her on her 25th birthday trip.

Taylor	Well, she's not my best friend.

Mike	Obviously not.

Taylor	I wouldn't worry about it. If she finds out, she'll just blame me and stay with you.

Mike	Yeah, right.

Taylor	Yeah. Right. That's what girls do.

Jenna	Did you find it?

Chris	Yeah.

Jenna	And?

Chris	I’ll give it to you, it's fucking weird. But whatever. You know, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't have a really good time last night either. I'm just saying, it wasn't all, like, "woo-hoo" for everyone there, except for you.

Jenna	That doesn't help, Chris.

Chris	Well, what happened? Maybe I can help.

Jenna	Life. Life happened.

Taylor	This place?

Mike	Yeah.

Taylor	Looks ancient.

Mike	So what? Let's go. Hello? I'm sure they're just in the back.

Taylor	Hello?! Hello?

Mike	Hello?

Owen	Morning.

Mike	Morning.

Owen	Can I help you with something?

Taylor	Yeah, car broke down. About 45 minutes back that way.

Owen	Outta gas?

Mike	No, the radiator's busted.

Owen	Ouch. Whew. Where you headed?

Mike	Back to Spencerville.

Owen	You live there?

Taylor	Yeah.

Owen	Together?

Mike	No. No. We're just friends.

Taylor	Yeah, we're not together. We just fuck.

Mike	Taylor.

Owen	Well! Best get you folks back on the road, then.

Mike	So you can fix it?

Owen	Hell no.

Mike	But you don't even know what's wrong with it.

Owen	Don't need to. Ain't got no replacement radiators here, anyhow. Best thing you folks to do is call a tow truck, get your asses back to the car, and get it towed to Spencerville and get it fixed there. You know, when you're home, safe and sound.

Mike	Okay, yeah, that was plan B.

Owen	Well, boy, it's plan A now.

Mike	You know the number?

Owen	Off by heart. Willard! Got a car, needs a tow. About two and half miles south of here. Kid says they need to go to Spencerville. Mm-hm. What kind of car is it?

Mike	It's an '81 Monte Carlo.

Owen	It's a Chev. Radiator's shot. Uh-huh. Mm. Says he can be there in about a half hour.

Mike	Great. We'll start back right now. I mean, friends are there already, so--

Owen	Your friends?

Mike	Yeah. We got two friends back at the car.

Owen	Oh. He says there's two more of them back at the car. Uh-huh, I know. Well, look, why don't you pick them up here? No sense of them walking all the way if you're gonna drive past anyhow. Right, right. All right. Half hour.

Mike	It's Willard, you said?

Owen	Willard. That's right.

Mike	Great.

Chris	What is that? Did he just take our picture?

Jenna	Yeah. Where's your camera?

Chris	That was fucking weird.

Jenna	Did you get it?

Taylor	Where the fuck is this tow truck?

Mike	Just relax.

Taylor	No, the guy's fucking nasty.

Mike	Hey. Keep your voice down.

Taylor	He even talks weird. I'm out.

Mike	What are you doing?

Taylor	Just pick me up on the way.

Mike	Pick you up on the way. Fuck you, pick you up on the way.

Owen	Goddammit! Son of a flea-bag… C’mon! Oh, baby, we're gonna be here all day

Mike	Hey, you all right back there?!

Owen	No! Goddammit. Bitch would make a preacher cuss! Come on! Come on, baby.

Mike	What is that?

Owen	Hobby of mine. Antique. If I can ever get the-- Aw! Son of a bitch.

Mike	You okay?
 
Owen	Yeah. The one goddamn lever won't budge.

Mike	Why don't you let me give it a go?

Owen	Be my guest. Watch your finger.

Mike	Yeah, it's on there pretty tight.

Chris	Why the fuck would he do that?

Jenna	We're leaving.

Chris	Wait. Maybe it's just some weird dude taking photos of shit.

Jenna	Sure, way off the main roads. Miles and miles from anywhere. What is it?

Chris	It's us.

Jenna	Stay close to me with that thing. Let's get to this fucking gas station.

Taylor	Mike? Hello?! Anyone?!

Owen	Help you?

Taylor	Holy shit, you scared the fuck outta me.

Owen	Well, I'm sorry.

Taylor	Where's my friend?

Owen	Oh, bathroom.

Taylor	I called for him, he didn't answer.

Owen	Oh, it's in the back. Kinda hard to hear. You can go on in if you want.

Taylor	That's all right. I'll wait for him outside.

Owen	Suit yourself.

Taylor	Where's this bathroom? Mike, come on!

Owen	Darling, you wanna talk to him, you go back there. I'm trying to concentrate. It's delicate.

Taylor	Mike!

Mike	Taylor. Taylor! Taylor! Come on, Taylor. Taylor, come on.

Owen	Stop! Hey, stop! Stop. Good boy. That is one fine-looking piece of meat you got yourself there. You really fucking her? Yeah? So you are together. Yeah? You're together?

Mike	Yeah.

Owen	Huh. oh. Now yous… Now you got me all confused, Michael, 'cause if that fine-looking piece of meat is with you, then who on earth is this other equally fine-looking piece of meat I found in your wallet? Hm? I mean, they similar, but they ain't the same. Huh? Did you just lie to me? Yeah you did. You been a bad boy, Michael? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you have. You been sticking your nasty little pecker into everything you can, haven't you? It's all right. It's all right. We all bad around here. Oh-hoo-hoo! We're gonna have some fun today.

Chris	What is it?

Jenna	It's another one.

Chris	What's wrong?

Jenna	Bitch. That guy took the picture. Just like he took ours. Whatever's going on here, it's fucked. And we gotta go, right now.

Chris	Why are they doing this?

Jenna	What, cheating on us?

Chris	Yeah. I just…I just don't get it.

Jenna	Okay. First boyfriend. Three awesome years together. Best friends. He fucked around on me. I wanted to know why, just like you do now. You wanna know what he told me? You wanna know why he did it? Because he did. Because it happens. Because people are shitty, and that's what people do. And that's the only truth you'll ever get.
  
Chris	But I just don't . What the fuck?!

Jenna	What the fuck?!

Chris	Run! 

Song	? oh? ? A good man is so hard to find ? ? We always get that rough old time ? ? Just when you think that he’s your pal ? ? You look and find him hanging round some ol gal ? ? Then you rave ? ? Child you crave you want to see him dead laying in his grave ? ?

Jenna	Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You gotta help me! There's a crazy guy out there!

Owen	Alright, alright, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold. What happened?

Jenna	There's a man. He's got my friend.

Owen	Calm down.

Jenna	We gotta call the police, right now!

Owen	All right, all right, I got a phone in the house. Go on, get in, go on. All right, you're safe. Well it don't look like much, but there's a phone's inside! Go on in! Oh. Good ahead.

Jenna	I don't think it's working.

Owen	You gonna wanna be careful with that. It's an antique. Never ceases to amaze me how desperation makes people so blind.

Jenna	What do you want?

Owen	What do I want? I wanna lay down some ground rules. Yeah? One: You speak out of turn to me, and I'll blow that pretty jaw off. Two: You do anything other than exactly what I tell you to do, I'm gonna shoot off one of your extremities. Maybe a hand at first. I don't know, do it again, a foot. But do it more than four times? I will blow off that pretty head of yours. Understood?

Jenna	Why are you doing this?

Owen	You don't done get it. Thats speaking outta turn. Speaking outta turn. Understood? Come on, why don't you go and help me with something? Go and make yourself useful. Come on. Come on. Now. Now, now, now. Now, go on. Well, go on. She ain't dead or nothing. Get her out. Come on. Don't be such a fucking sissy. Come on! Let's go! Well, let's try not to kill her in the process, shall we? What are you doing? Pick her up! Come on! I said, pick her up. Pick her up! Throw her over your shoulder, and let's walk her inside!

Jenna	No! Fuck you!

Owen	Do not take that tone with me, you fucking cunt! You remember the rules?! You remember the rules I said?! You pick her up! Pick her up! Pick her up. Go on. You can go ahead and put her over there. That'll do, darling. For now.

Oswald	“To be, or not to be, "that is the question: "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, "or to take arms against a sea of troubles, "and by opposing end them: "to die, to sleep; no more; "and by a sleep, to say we end the heartache, "and the thousand natural shocks "that flesh is heir to? "'Tis a con, con...

Owen	Consummation!

Oswald	“Consummation devoutly to be wished. "To die, to sleep, "to sleep, perchance to dream; "aye, there's the rub, "for in that sleep of death, "what dreams may come, "when we have shuffled off this mortal coil."

Owen	Yes. Finally, ladies, ladies, ladies, welcome back to the land of the living. Aw, well, I thought you was never gonna wake up. Now that you have, I can see you're both looking good enough to eat. Metaphorically speaking, of course. We don't actually eat people around here. That'd be just a little too cliche. Our ox, however, he developed a taste for that warm, soft human flesh. No accounting for his taste. Mine, well, I'm more of a steak man, I guess. Like a thick, juicy cut. Hold on, y'all ain't no vegetarians, are you? Good 'cause I fucking hate those people. I'm sorry, baby. I know those things might be a little uncomfortable, but believe me when say they are for your own good. You don't understand, there are worse things than me here. My brother hears one word outta your mouth, he will cut your fucking tongue out. See, he crazy. You know, in the head. Now, who we got here? Let's do this, introductions. You must be Taylor, is that correct? Which makes you Jenna. Happy belated, by the way. Case y'all didn't know, I'm Owen. I thought it might be prudent to kick off these proceedings with a little demonstration. Oswald! Honey, he don't like it when people stare. Now, manners are so very, very important, ladies. That's why my brother here's gonna show you fine, young pieces of meat exactly what will befall you if you do not do what you're told. Oswald, go ahead. Shut up! Well, ladies, I'd say that's pretty clear, mm? No confusion, no ambiguity, wouldn't you say so? Going to take your stunned silence as compliance, hm? Hey. Take him outside. Cut him up while he's still fresh. Go on! It's feeding time. Goddammit. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, listen. Hey, hey! You gonna behave if I take this out? You're all right, you're all right. Listen, no need to feel ashamed. Lots of people do that. You'll be all right, you'll be all right.

Taylor	What the fuck is going on? Where's Mike?

Owen	Now. I know, I know. Don't that feel a little better, though? Hm? Don't you feel a little refreshed? Well, to answer your question, Michael will be here shortly. Course, he might not be in one piece when he gets here, but he will be here nonetheless. Which reminds me, and I don't mean to be the bringer of bad tidings, but this one, she been carrying on with your man behind your back. Oh. You already know. Well, ain't that something, huh? You know, I read this thing somewhere once, said the people in this country think that cheating on them, it's just about the worst thing you can do to them. The second one is just killing them. Don't you find that messed up? I'm gonna see Michael real soon. You want me to say something to him? You love him? You miss him? Or you hate him? You can tell me. You know, I don't really go in for all this drama, so I'm gonna let you two work it all out, get your affairs in order.

Jenna	Hey. Hey! Hey. One, two, three. One. Two. Three. One, two, three. One. Two. Three. Go, go, go. Get up, get up, get up. Get up, get up.

Taylor	Where's the car?

Jenna	What?

Taylor	We called for a tow truck.

Jenna	Oh. This way, this way. 

Owen	? When I die, bury me ? ? Hang my balls on a cherry tree ? ? When they're ripe, take a bite ? ? Don't blame me if they don't taste right ? Hey. Michael. You awake? Psst. Oh, what, think you're the first pretty boy to play dead to avoid the prod? You ain't. And ain't gonna be the last.

Mike	Why are you doing this?

Owen	Why I am doing this? Is that what you said? Why does everybody ask that same fucking predictable question? 'Cause it needs doing. Now, we gots to take a  trip. Seeing as I can't have you giving me any trouble, though, I gots to put you out again, I'm afraid.

Mike	No.

Owen	I know, I know. No, I know, I know. But, like I said, it needs doing. Now, I'm in a good mood, okay? So I'm gonna give you a choice. How do you want it? You want Jenna? Or you want Taylor? Well, Michael, that's the real question, innit? Which girl's Michael gonna choose? Jenna, she's nice. She's feisty, I like that. Taylor. Which one? Which one, which one, which one? Yah, you know what? I wanna be surprised. Don't tell me, don't tell me.

Taylor	There it is. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Thank God you're still here.

Willard	Well, of course, I'm here. You called, didn't you?

Taylor	Yeah, well, we need to leave this place right now.

Willard	Mm-hm, well, that is the plan, but, like, the hell happened to you?

Taylor	These guys out there, they killed our friend.

Willard	What? Who?

Taylor	That guy Owen.

Willard	Owen Watson?

Taylor	Yeah, and some crazy fucking psycho. He--

Jenna	Oswald.

Willard	I know Owen. Don't know no Oswald.

Jenna	Oh, we have to get outta here! Can we go, like, right now?! Please.

Willard	Yeah, all right. Get in the car.

Taylor	We can't ride with you?

Willard	Nobody rides in my baby but me. Now just get in the car.

Taylor	Come on, Jenna. So um, you know about me and Mike?

Jenna	That’s the last fucking thing I wanna talk about right now.

Taylor	I know, I just wanted to say that--

Jenna	Don’t.

Taylor	I wanted to say thank you for getting us outta there.

Jenna	Yeah, sure.

Taylor	What the fuck? Why'd we stop?

Willard	Get out, girls. I'm gonna give you five seconds to get outta the car, or I just shoot you through the window. Five. Four.

Taylor	What do we do?

Willard	Three. Two. Good girls. Couple of good girls. Now, despite what you might be thinking, I'm not the bad guy. I'm Willard. What's your name?

Taylor	Taylor.

Willard	Taylor. I like that name. You?

Taylor	Her name is Jenna.

Willard	Jenna. Jenna and Taylor. Those are, like, porno names, huh? All right. Now that that's over with, start walking. You gonna make me count to five again? Now if you wanted to die, sugar, you'd a just stayed in the car.

Oswald	Just do what you're told. That's all you gotta do. Just do what you're told!

Jenna	Let me get to her. Let me get to her.

Oswald	This is what happens when you don't do what you're told!

Taylor	I’m sorry.

Willard	Where's Oxford?

Oswald	In his den.

Willard	Shitload of good it does you there.

Oswald	Not allowed to let him out.

Willard	You ever heard of the expression "waste not, want not"?

Oswald	No.

Willard	Well, basically, what it means is when you luck into pussy that good, you don't go slicing it up. That's a fucking waste.

Oswald	You best not talk to me like that, Willard. You don't call the shots round here.

Willard	When Owen's not around, I do call the shots round here. Open the door. Out. Introduce yourself. You best fix that goddamn door.

Oswald	No.

Willard	You do what the fuck I tell you to do, boy.

Oswald	Don’t call me boy.

Willard	Sometimes, I think it would be best just to blow your goddamn fool crazy head off. Make things a lot easier for the rest of us.

Oswald	Owen would kill you.

Willard	Yeah. Yeah, okay. You just keep on thinking that. Boy.

Oswald	Don't call me boy!

Jenna	Oh, my god. I can get us out of here. How long have you been in this place? What's wrong? What? Oh, no. You're alive. That's what matters. I'm gonna get you out of here. And I'm gonna get your baby out of here. Here, come here, come here. Here. Stop!

Owen	Willard.

Willard	One of these days, Owen, that little brother of yours is gonna fuck things up in ways that we can't fix!

Owen	Why, what happened?!

Willard	You had two girls up at the barn, right?

Owen	Yeah.

Willard	Well, now you only got one. They turned the tables on Oswald and they were all but gone! I lucked into them at their car, and brought them back, but then he's gotta go and slice one of them up!

Owen	All right, hold your horses.

Willard	What the fuck's going on with that?!

Owen	Hold your horses, Willard!

Willard	This shit's never happened when your mother was here, you understand?! I mean, for the love of Christ, you rein him in! You know, you are here by the grace of one person, and one person only, and that sure as hell ain't God!

Owen	Willard! Willard! Oswald! Oswald! Ah, you... Oswald! Oswald! What in the fuck is going on?! I just passed Uncle Willard on the road, tells me this whole fucking place has gone to hell! Oh, you can't talk, dummy?! Oswald, hey, what the fuck is going on?! Oswald! What?! Fuck's sake, goddammit. What the fuck is this shit?! I knew it! You can't do nothing right. You can’t do…You’re so stupid, Oswald! Shut up!

Oswald	No, you shut up. Don't talk to me like that! "Oswald, what the fuck is wrong with you? "Oswald, you can't do nothing right!" Shut up!

Owen	All right, all right! All right, all right. All right. Oswald. Hey, all right. Hey. Stop. I'm sorry, okay? I’m…I’m sorry. That was indelicate. Come… Oswald, I'm sorry. Come on. Come on, come on. ? It's all right, don't you worry ? ? It's all right, don't you cry ? ? It's all right, don't you worry ? ? 'Cause Momma's still alive ? ? It's all right, don't you worry ? ? It's all right, don't you cry ? ? It's all right, don't you worry ? Oswald. Oswald, okay, look. Listen to me, listen to me. Sometimes, these things, they just don't go the way we planned, okay? That's just life. That's just life, that's all right. That's all right because Owen gonna take care of it. He gonna clean all this mess up. All right, look, why don't you go clear your head, take a walk? And I'll clean all this up. Yeah. All right. Jesus H. Christ. Perfect. Well, guess we don't to need worry about which one of us is daddy no more. Ah, we'll just keep that to ourselves, shall we? And Oswald was so looking forward to being a daddy. I think we both know that's not a good idea. Let's get you outta here.

Willard	Goddammit!

Jenna	Oh, my god. Wake up, wake up! Shh shh, It’s okay. It's okay.

Owen	Damn waste.

Mike	Where is he?

Jenna	He’s in there. Just be quiet. We have to get out of here. No, Mike, get up. Mike, come on.

Mike	Get in the truck.

Jenna	What?

Mike	Get in the truck.

Jenna	What? What are you doing?

Mike	I'm fucking this asshole up.

Jenna	No, let's go. We go, we can go now. Mike. He's not the only one out here. Mike.

Owen	Oswald! That's enough. Get up. Go on. Make a run. Go on, I want you to. Go on. I'll cut you up so small, my ox won't even have to chew. Oswald!

Jenna	Mike, Mike.

Mike	I'm sorry.

Jenna	Mike, I needed you to go.

Mike	I had to, I had to. You have to go.

Jenna	No.

Oswald	Sic 'em. Oxford! Get her. Mm, bye-bye. You gonna die. Heel! 

Song	My heart is sad and I am all alone ? ? My mans treating me mean ? ? I regret the day that I was born ? ? And that man of mine I'd ever seen ? ? My happiness, it lasts a day ? ? My heart is broke that’s why I say ?

Oswald	Waste not, want not. 

Song	A good man is hard to find ? ? You always get another kind ? ? Just when you think that he is your pal ? ? You look and find him hanging round some old gal ? ? Then you rave ? ? Child you crave you want to see him dead laying in his grave ? ? So, if your man is nice, take my advice ? ? hug him in the morning, kiss him at night ? ? Give him plenty smiles, Madam, treat your man right ? ? For a good man nowadays sure is hard to find ?
