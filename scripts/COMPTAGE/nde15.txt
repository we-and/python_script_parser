MALLORY 		(chuckles) I don't even know you. I can't go divulging my darkest secrets. 

BEN 			I'm very trustworthy. 

MALLORY 		You're very drunk. 

BEN 		Mm. (chuckles) I fell out of a second-story window. I snuck into my neighbor's house to steal some Vicodin. I went into their medicine cabinet, and... they came home, so I climbed out the window. 

MALLORY 		That's... how you broke your arm? You jumped? 

BEN 			I guess. I barely remember that part. It was kinda stupid. 

MALLORY 		It sounds pretty stupid. 

BEN 			Mm.

BEN 			(sighs) Sorry. I had a terrible night, if it's any consolation. 

LIAM 		I raised you better than this shit. Come on, Ben. You're smarter than this. 

BEN 		You and mom raised me. Maybe you both should stop patting yourselves on the backs, all right? I just missed a stupid fucking dinner. 

LIAM 			Sit! You are going to apologize. 

BEN 			I said I'm sorry. I'm going to bed. 

LIAM 			You are gonna sit there and apologize to Sara!

BEN 			No. Why would you say you didn't have a kid when you do? 

MALLORY 		I don't know. Maybe he's just a private person. 

BEN 		No, Mal... He had no idea who I was talking about. Like, he couldn't remember his kid at all, and Dillon, you should have seen him. He was fucking terrified of his own mom. 

MALLORY 		Okay. Um, so... Maybe just go knock on her door and ask her if she could…Okay, that's just funny. Okay, well, I have to go lock up for your dad now. So... Have a good stakeout. (sighs)

MALLORY 		Ben! 

BEN 		Look, take that salt, and I want you to pour it around the tree, all right? It's gonna trap her. 

MALLORY 		What do you mean, you tried to save her? What's going on? I need you to tell me what's going on! 

BEN 			(overlapping) (sighs) It took Lily, and it's got my brother. I have to go.

MALLORY 		(grunts) 

LIAM 			Ahh!

MALLORY 		Mom, we're headed out. 

MALLORY 		I'm doing pretty good, considering. Uh, Lily's getting better every day, some nightmares. 

COUNSELOR 		It's expected. People died. It's a lot to process, especially for someone her age. Uh, before you go, I wanted to, um, I wanted to ask you about something that your sister said her last session. She said, “You had to burn the tree.” What tree? Do you have any idea what she's talking about?  Mallory? 

MALLORY 		Um, sounds like one of her nightmares. 

MALLORY 		All right, hold on, team. Wait for the rest of us. Let's go. 

BEN 			Hey, Starcrush. 

MALLORY 		Headed out? 

BEN 			Yeah, heading home. 

LIAM 			Hey! 

MALLORY 		So... 

BEN 			(grunts) 

MALLORY 		Your mom and dad? 

BEN 			Nah, no, she's just, uh, she's just driving back with us. 

MALLORY		Cool. 

BEN 			Yeah. 

MALLORY 		Well, good luck with... everything. 

BEN 			Thanks. You too, you know, with the rest of your summer. 

MALLORY 		Cool. (chuckles) All right, well... Adios, muchacho? 

BEN 			Yeah, okay. (chuckles) 

MALLORY 		(chuckles) (kiss) That is from Lily. 

BEN 			That's from me. 

MALLORY 		(chucking) Take care of yourself, Ben. Don't forget me. (to children) All right, who's ready to go? 

BEN 			Hey. 

LIAM 			Hey, stud muffin. 

BEN 			You ready? 

LIAM 			(chuckling) Yeah. 

BEN 			Let's go. 

LIAM 			Thank you. 

BEN 			Hey, so when we get back, I kinda thought-- 

LIAM 		Listen, (clicks tongue) I think I'm gonna stay with your Uncle Rory for a couple of weeks until this heals up and, you know, until your mom and I can figure things out. 

BEN 			Hey, however it works out, Dad. It's fine. 

LIAM 			All right. 

LIAM 			Oh! 

NORA 			You good? 

LIAM 			Ow. 

NATHAN		So this is Ben's car now? 

NORA 			She's pretty. 

LIAM 			Ow. 

NORA 	(chuckles) Something to know about your dad is that he's a huge baby when it comes to pain. 

LIAM 			No, I'm not. 

NORA			(chuckles) 

LIAM 			I got a lot of boo-boos here. 

CHILD #1 		It's a magic fairy. 

CHILD #2		It is... this is a spider. 

CHILD #1 		Ooh! 

CHILD #2		This is a cockroach.
