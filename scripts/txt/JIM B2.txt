KAEPTN W	Dragon, where is Ms. Grindtooth? The Captain of the Wild  would like to see her.

DRACHE GRIMBART	Ms. Grindtooth has been vanquished.

KAEPTN W	Who dare do such a thing?

DRACHE GRIMBART	(Atmer) T'was two steam engine drivers. They brazenly snuck into the Dragon City like common thieves.
KAEPTN W	Two steam engine drivers you say?

KAEPTN W	T'is only a matter of time till our paths cross.

KAEPTN W	And then you'll all be cursin' the day you were born, ya' hear?

KAEPTN W	For we are the Wild . (Lachen..Jubel)

W	Yeah!!! LAUTE

DRACHE 	LACHEN

ERZAEHLER	The weather was usually fine in Morrowland, our island with two mountains, a train station and a castle. But of course there were days, when it rained. But don‘t think that it was one of those gloomy rains, that we have from time to time. No, not a bit. In Morrowland, even so called bad weather, wasn‘t all that bad. It tended to be cheerful and boisterous. More like a symphony of raindrops, that splished and splashed and pitter-pattered merrily on the windowsills. The rain gutters gurgled and chattered, and water rushed into the puddles as if an excited crowd would clap in their hands. And on just such a rainy day our story begins.

JIM	You like that, right?(Lächler)

LUKAS	Jim, take a look.

LUKAS	That's the bridge to New Morrowland. made of iron, stable enough to carry Molly and Emma.

JIM	Luke, Molly's ready for a real adventure now, don't you think?
LUKAS	(Atmer) Yeah, well, listen, you can't just go looking for an adventure, Jim. - It's gotta find you. You know what I mean?

JIM	Hmm.

LUKAS	We'll be headin' out soon, I'm sure.  Wait and see.

LUKAS	The weather is starting to get bad. Why don't you go inside, I'll clean up here.

JIM	Okay

LUKAS	LAUTE

LUKAS	LAUTE Some weather out there... The fog is like pea soup.

LUKAS	Is it possible to get a nice cup of hot tea perhaps? (ATMER) And maybe with an oversized shot of rum?

FRAU WAAS	Whatever you want my dear Luke. And who would like a slice of cake, freshly made.

JIM	Me!

LUKAS	Me

LI SI	Me.

FRAU WAAS	(CHUCKLE)

JIM	Two ships, I win.

LI SI	That's what you think. Four ships. And one pirate.

LUKAS	LACHEN

LI SI	Are you actually letting me win on purpose?

JIM	I would like to. But you keep winning. No matter what I do.

JIM	I'd rather fight a whole city full of dragons.

LUKAS	Since we're talking about dragons, your highness...

LI SI	Luke, don't call me that.

LUKAS	Li Si. What I've been wanting to ask for a while - what's up with that older dragon, Ms Grindtooth, how is she?

LI SI	OFF She's still asleep. Her transformation is almost complete.

LI SI	ON She gleams from head to toe, as if she were made of pure gold.

LI SI	I still can't believe she used to be an evil dragon. OFF Papa has her guarded night and day.

LUKAS	[schlrfen]

LI SI	ON He has ordered to be advised, when she wakes up.

LUKAS	She's becoming a golden Dragon of Wisdom - that's able to answer all questions.

JIM	[Atmer]

LI SI	Have you though about what you want to ask her, Jim?

JIM	AUSATMER Well

FRAU WAAS	(ins ON) Maybe it's good that we don't have an answer to each and every question in the world. Hmm!

JIM, LUKAS	[Atmer]

FRAU WAAS	OFF Huh?

POSTBOTE	OFF Help. Help!

HERR AERMEL	Goodness gracious. What happened here?

HERR AERMEL	that could perhaps in such situations be of great use to all those involved. ATMERLAUTE

KOENIG ALFONS	LAUTE Uhh, yea -eahh... LAUTE

FRAU WAAS	(ins ON) Yes, but in this particular situation you would likely get your lovely new suit all soiled and stained.

HERR AERMEL	Heh, ATMER ... used to be, way back when - yeah there was a time when I taught Jim as a little boy.

HERR AERMEL	But, uh, - he doesn't need my help anymore either. And if I'm honest no one needs my help anymore.

HERR AERMEL	LAUTE I go for long walks - and EINATMER and I'm ruled by a King. And I'm otherwise worthless.

JIM	Poor Mr. Sleeve. OFF We have to find something for him to do.

LUKAS	Like what? ATMER

POSTBOTE	Oh, I don't know how to express my thanks.

KOENIG ALFONS	LAUTE

FRAU WAAS	That was the third accident we had.

POSTBOTE	Yes, but this time it was particularly prickly.

FRAU WAAS	[Laut]

POSTBOTE	The fog - was, was incredibly thick. I, I could barely see my hands in front of my face. And then,

POSTBOTE	then unexpectedly - I smacked into New Morrowland.

KOENIG ALFONS	Aha. (LAUTE)

JIM	ATMER

POSTBOTE	Luke. This is for you.

LUKAS	Thank you.

POSTBOTE	OFF Your (other?) Highness. A letter from your father. The emperor.

POSTBOTE	LAUTE

KOENIG ALFONS	Hm? Oh!

LI SI	ATMER

JIM	Uhmm, is there anything for me too?

FRAU WAAS	ATMER

POSTBOTE	I'm sorry - no there isn't, Jim. Not this time around.

LUKAS	Atmer

KOENIG ALFONS	Atmer

JIM	Oh. And not the last time. Nothing either.

LI SI	[Atmer]

LUKAS	Good night, Jim.

FRAU WAAS	Good night, Jim.

POSTBOTE	OFF Good night. ATMER, Hm, yeah.

KOENIG ALFONS	Good night.

FRAU WAAS	[Laute]

LUKAS	Are you doing okay, Ms Whaat?

FRAU WAAS	Oh, Lukey. You know, I'm well aware what Jim 'll ask the Golden Dragon when it finally awakens.

LUKAS	And what's that.

FRAU WAAS	Who his parents are. Who is he, who'se his family?

FRAU WAAS	It's on his mind day and night. Should I have taken better care of you, my little Jim?

LUKAS	OFF You take great care of him. I see it, from mornings till evenings there's nothing else you think about.

FRAU WAAS	Maybe it's just not enough.

LUKAS	ATMERLAUTE Jim's a good sport. I don't think we need to worry too much about him.

FRAU WAAS	And what if he finds what he's looking for? Except he's not happy with the answer? And if something happens to him?

LUKAS	LAUTE


FRAU WAAS	You know very well of all the dangers out there.

LUKAS	Dangers are sometimes like mock giants. Big and awful from afar, but when you get a little closer they're really just trifling.

FRAU WAAS	LAUTE  ATMER  ATMER  LAUTE

STIMMEN	[ Text ]

FRAU WAAS	Good night, Luke

LUKAS	LAUTE Good night, Ms Whaat.

JIM	OFF Come in.

LI SI	Good morning sleepy head. We wanted to go on an excursion with Molly.

JIM	I'll be right there.

LI SI	Did you receive another package?

JIM	This is the box in which the Wild  sent me to Morrowland in back then.

LI SI	The Wild . Papa is having them chased across all Oceans. But they've always escaped.

LI SI	It's really tough not to know your own, parents, huh?

JIM	But, you have parents.

LI SI	My mother died when I was still very small.

JIM	I'm so sorry.

LI SI	At home - we've got pictures of her. If I had one wish, only one,

LI SI	ATMER I'd wish to be able to meet with her. Just once.

JIM	There aren't any pictures, of my family. OFF Sometimes I wonder if they ever existed at all.

JIM	ON I finally want to know where I'm from Li Si. And who I am.

JIM	Here in Morrowland, I won't find anything. That's for sure.

KOENIG ALFONS	CONT Sublets of my kingdom, uh, uh, subjects. ATMER

FRAU WAAS	LAUTE

KOENIG ALFONS	The incident with the mail boat, made a crystal vase uh uh made crystal clear,

KOENIG ALFONS	that things are – gonna have to change. The U.S. of M. and N.M. are in grave danger.

LUKAS	The what?

KOENIG ALFONS	The United States of Morrowland and New Morrowland!

FRAU WAAS	Uh-huh-

LUKAS	Oh.

FRAU WAAS	But uh, why is that, your majesty?

KOENIG ALFONS	The rises are casing, I mean, the cases are rising.

KOENIG ALFONS	(Atmer) And since speaking with my friend, - Pung Ging - the emperor of Mandala - CONT about diplomatic relations,

KOENIG ALFONS	maritime traffic has increased quite substantially. What are we going to do when his royal ship runs aground off the coast of New Morrowland, eh? Kaboom?

KOENIG ALFONS	I don't even want to think about it!

KOENIG ALFONS	Which is why I have made up my mind - that we've got to - do something about this. Mh-hmm.

LUKAS	(Atmer) What we need is a lighthouse.

KOENIG ALFONS	That there is a wonderfu idea, however - where are we gonna put such a lighthouse? Hm?

KOENIG ALFONS	We're seaming at the bursts?

EINATMER

JIM	Your Majesty. We could ask Mr. Tur Tur. He doesn't need much space.

JIM	And from far away, he's bigger than all the lighthouses stacked on top of one another. We just need to give him a lamp.

JIM	Come on, Luke. We can set sail with Emma and Molly again.

LUKAS	LAUTE

FRAU WAAS	(OFF ) That is much too dangerous, Mr Tur Tur lives far, far away. EINATMER Mh- In Mirror Desert, right in the middle. (NOTE- Yes, clanky syntax, but looks better.)

LUKAS	[off][Laut]

HERR AERMEL	[laut]

JIM	OFF We'll be fine. Won't we Luke?

LUKAS	Mhm.

KOENIG ALFONS	I want you to know this is the utmost urgence of urgencies. Luke how quickly could you set sail with Emma, hm?

LUKAS	[laute]

JIM	First thing in the morning. Your majesty-

KOENIG ALFONS	Oh.

LUKAS	Well if my young colleague says so then...

KOENIG ALFONS	OFF I herby decree that Mr. Tur Tur be brought to Morrowland and declare our government crisis - to be over.

FRAU WAAS	[Atmer]

LUKAS	[LAute]

LUKAS	And quicker than you thought your wish has come true. AND here we go!

JIM	REAX

KOENIG ALFONS	OFF My dear loyal subjects, I am, uh, moved. ATMER Exceptionally.

HERR AERMEL	That, your highness, I would emphatically concur.

KOENIG ALFONS	The US of M and the and N.M are very proud of you.

HERR AERMEL	[Laut]

JIM	So why don't you come with us.

LI SI	The imperial ship will pick me up tomorrow. Papa is waiting for me at home.

JIM	BREATH Do you always do what your father tells you to.

LI SI	You're just happy you don't get to go to the Great Ball.

FRAU WAAS	Jim? Hey. Promise you'll take care of yourself.

JIM	BREATH

LUKAS	No need to be fretting about what hasn't yet happened. Engine drivers like us have grappled with bigger problems, rIght Jim?

FRAU WAAS	[Laute]

LUKAS	Let's go, big guy - Time to head out.

LUKAS	Are we on course, Jim?

JIM	Aye, aye, Captain! Molly, are you alright?

SURSULAPITSCHI	OFF Hello-oh. You up there. Did you just give me a hoot?

SURSULAPITSCHI	(Atmer) You are land- dwellers.

LUKAS	Well hello there, madame.

JIM	Lukas! That's a---

LUKAS	... a mermaid.

LUKAS	OFF Meerpeople view things from a watery perspective. (VAR water level) But otherwise they are quite nice.

SURSULAPITSCHI	What strange ships you are travelling with.

LUKAS	Molly and Emma are locomotives. They run on fire and steam.

SURSULAPITSCHI	My name is Sursulapitschi.

SURSULAPITSCHI	Sorry for asking, dear friends, but if you know your way around steam and all, then you're certainly familiar with - machines, electricity, magnets and other such stuff, right?

JIM	Hm!

LUKAS	Hm

LUKAS	Yeah, of course.

SURSULAPITSCHI	Oh, please follow me to the great Gurumusch Magnet-Rocks.

SURSULAPITSCHI	(Atmer) My great, great, great, great, greatGrandfather, the very first Sea King, had it constructed long, long ago.

SURSULAPITSCHI	It worked for thousands of years. But now - there is blackness all over the seas. (VAR wherever you look)

JIM	What's the problem exactly?

SURSULAPITSCHI	ATMER The aquatic lights no longer light up. (VAR The milky seas no longer light up.) FEEDBACK ERWNSCHT

LUKAS	I guess we can come by and take a look. But we can't afford to lose too much time.

SURSULAPITSCHI	Yay!

SURSULAPITSCHI	Wuh! Wuhuu!
JIM	What is that there?

SURSULAPITSCHI	Ah! My beloved Uschaurischumm. Do you know him by any chance?

JIM	Ehh, I'm afraid not.

SURSULAPITSCHI	Ach. He's an endearing schicknick. And still so young. Not even ten thousand years old, yet.

JIM	Hm.

SURSULAPITSCHI	But really clever. .

JIM	Where is your friend now?

SURSULAPITSCHI	That is a really sad story.

SURSULAPITSCHI	My father is terribly old- fashioned. ATMER We can't marry each other until we have found the Crystal of Eternity.

JIM	The Crystal of Eternity?

SURSULAPITSCHI	A very special glass that never breaks. How it was made, is a big secret.

SURSULAPITSCHI	For over  years we have been looking for it.

JIM	You'll find it one day. I'm sure of it.

SURSULAPITSCHI	No, I don't believe you understand.

SURSULAPITSCHI	ATMER To make the Crystal of Eternity once again requires assistance from a fire-creature.

SURSULAPITSCHI	ATMER Thousands of years ago they had been our friends. Now they're our biggest enemies. It is really hopeless.

JIM	[Atmer]

LUKAS	Hmm. BREATH

JIM	The Gurumusch Magnet Rock.

SURSULAPITSCHI	LACHEN

LUKAS	LAUTE Na, come on girl. Help me outta here, you can do it. LAUTE

SURSULAPITSCHI	OFF You can make your way to the source of the lights from up there.

JIM	BREATH

SURSULAPITSCHI	Just be careful, my dear friends.

LUKAS	LAUTE

LUKAS	So let's see what's here.

JIM	BREATH Luke - this must be the entrance. LAUTE

LUKAS	ATMER  LAUTE

JIM, LUKAS	[O-Ton gefischt]

LUKAS	I think we must be far below sea- level now. We're approaching the earth's core, Jim.

JIM	Is that why it is getting so hot?
LUKAS	The deeper we climb down, the more hot it'll get. The earth's core is fiery. LAUTE

JIM	OFF How much further does this go down?

LUKAS	OFF The shaft ends here.

LUKAS	ATMER

JIM	[Atmer]

JIM	CONT Looks like someone removed something here.

LUKAS	OFF There is something written there.

LUKAS	OFF This is the secret truth - ON of the first Mer - King Gurumusch.

LUKAS	Whoever understands it is smart. (ins OFF) Whoever applies it - is powerful.

JIM	BREATH

JIM	The mighty power of day and night, Slumbers, hidden - here and there.

JIM	When they're separated, they sleep on. When they're connected, the might awakens.

JIM	BREATH If we connect the	two ends ...

LUKAS	...the might awakens.

JIM	Yeah!

LUKAS	The missing piece, we have to find it.

JIM	REAX  ATMER

JIM	OFF Luke!

LUKAS	ATMER Good job, Jim.

LUKAS	ATMER  LAUTE

LUKAS	[Laute]

LUKAS	[Laute]

LUKAS	Don't worry, I don't think it'll hurt us. The light is not a result of electricity. But rather, enormous magnetic forces.

LUKAS	The mysterious power from Old King Gurumusch. SMILE

JIM	Luke, look at this!

LUKAS	ATMER

LUKAS	Quite okay for two Morrowlanders, huh?

JIM	[Raek]

JIM	Look at all the ships.

LUKAS	The magnet sucked all the nails from out of the hulls. They didn't stand a chance.

JIM	Molly, what are you doing up there?

LUKAS	Holy iron rails, the magnet must have done that. Never saw that before.

SURSULAPITSCHI	ATMER Oh, you did it! You really did it! Thank you kindly!

SURSULAPITSCHI	The aquatic lights are magnificent, right? LAUTE I'm gonna go let everybody know.

LUKAS	Hey, wai-, wai, wai-, wai-, wait.

JIM	Wait Sursulapitschi!

JIM	We can't get away from here. The magnet is pulling on our locomotives.

SURSULAPITSCHI	LAUT OFF Oh heavens in the deep blue sea. What can we do about that?

LUKAS	It means we're gonna have to turn the lights off again.

SURSULAPITSCHI	B- but, that -

JIM	Maybe someone could switch it back on when we're far enough away.

LUKAS	Except that this someone is gonna have to remain here and turn it off if necessary.

JIM	And it has to be someone who can take the heat down there.

SURSULAPITSCHI	My Ushurishoom. He's protected. With his shell that won't bother him.

JIM	But for you - it's life threatening.You two could never really be together again.

SURSULAPITSCHI	But maybe I could see my beloved from afar, hah? When he's standing guard? Don't you worry, my dear friends.

JIM	OFF But Sursulapitschi! – Wait. We will find someone else.

JIM	We will. I'm sure of that.

LUKAS	We'll make sure your sea will be lit again.

SURSULAPITSCHI	Many thanks, my dear friends. Farewell.

LUKAS	Na, come on, Jim. Let's turn it off, hm? Grab a couple of candles, yeah?

JIM	Molly!

LUKAS	Everything okay?

JIM	Molly... are you okay?

LUKAS	Let's make sure we head out before it gets dark.

JIM	ATMER  LAUTE(O-Ton gefischt)

LUKAS	ATMER Jiiimmm!

LUKAS	ATMER REAX

JIM	Luke, hey did you hurt yourself?

LUKAS	Holy cow, big guy. How'd you manage to do that?

JIM	OFF These two pieces I found on opposite sides of the two island peaks.

JIM	Just now, I connected them with the hammer. By accident.

JIM	Luke, do you see the power it had? It pulled Emma as if it were nothing?

LUKAS	ATMER As if she were nothing. ATMER Of course. We could make a ...

LUKAS	[Atmer]

LUKAS	ATMER Yeah, that's my girl. Just you wait and see.

LUKAS	ATMER, LAUTE(O-Ton gefischt)

LUKAS	You're gonna like this, my little baby.

JIM	SNORE  ATMER

LUKAS	Jim. Wake up. Wake up. ATMER

JIM, LUKAS	[O-Ton gefischt]

JIM	What did you do to Emma?

LUKAS	A perpetual motion machine. An invention that was inspired by you, Jim.

JIM	And what can the perpetual motion machine do?

LUKAS	It'll provide us unlimited energy.

LUKAS	If this works then Emma won't need coal anymore. Then she can- get this Jim - bring us anywhere we want in the world.

JIM	ATMER

LUKAS	Yeah, yeah, seems to be only one problem. LAUTE To make it work I'm gonna have to dismantle Molly's basket.

JIM	Dismantle it? Then how could we transport Molly back?

LUKAS	We can't. That means we gotta leave her here.

LUKAS	You saw yourself how strong the magnet is. That's a risk we can't take. It'd be way too dangerous for Molly.


JIM	[Atmer]

LUKAS	I'm so sorry.

JIM	No Molly, I don't get it either.

JIM	ATMER We'll only be gone for a short time. And we'll be back soon. ATMER Don't be scared.

JIM	Dear Stranger, if you find Molly, please leave her here. We'll be back to pick her up soon. Jim and Luke.

LUKAS	ATMER Don't you worry about Molly. If our little invention here works we'll be back faster than you can say Morrowland, yeah? LAUTE Ready?

LUKAS	CONT Hold tight.

JIM	Morrowland!!!

LUKAS	REAX

JIM	Yoo hoo!

LUKAS	Wait a sec, it gets even better.

LUKAS	LAUGH LAUTE LAUGH

LUKAS	Next stop - Mr Tur Tur's Oasis.

JIM	The Wild . Luke!

LUKAS	Jim! Let go!

LUKAS	Hold o-on. LAUTE

LUKAS	ATMER Boy oh boy that was close.

JIM	The Wild . The kids - that we freed from the Dragon City -

JIM	they told me about - a ship with scarlet sails.

JIM	But you saw it too - right Luke?

LUKAS	We're in the middle of the desert, Jim. That was a Fata Morgana. It was a mirage, an optical illusion.

LUKAS	We've seen mirages before - don't you remember?

JIM	ATMER

LUKAS	ATMER LAUTE

LUKAS	Everything okay, my little baby?

ATMER

JIM	I'm sorry , Emma.

TURTUR	LAUTE

JIM	Poor man. What's bothering him?

TURTUR	O i oi oi oi oi

JIM	Mr. Turtur!

TURTUR	Why do you keep follwoing me, you monster. You wanna eat me? Is that it?

LUKAS	If we don't get one of your tasty breakfasts I can't guarantee anything.

TURTUR	[Laute]

JIM	OFF It's us, Your friends - Jim Button and Luke.

TURTUR	No, that is not possible. The Valley of Twilight caved in, no one can get through. You are nothing but a 

LUKAS	Great Balls of Fire!

TURTUR	LAUTE It really is the two of you.

TURTUR	My friends - Jim - and Luke.

LUKAS	LACHEN

TURTUR	ATMER That means you didn't forget Tur Tur.

JIM	Of course not.

LUKAS	Mr Turtur. What's going on here anyway?

TURTUR	A monster settled in my house, inside. A horrible beast. With a gaping maw. Wheezing fire and smoke!

LUKAS	A wild beast that breathes fire.

JIM	Sounds like a dragon.

TURTUR	Yes! A dragon. Aghastly, hideous dragon.

LUKAS	We've dealt with beasts like these.Right, Jim? 

JIM	ATMER

JIM	[Atmer]

LUKAS	Jim! Jim!

JIM	ATMER

NEPOMUK	[Laute](O-Ton gefischt)

NEPOMUK	Oh, man I’m dying for a terribly stinky little lava snack.

JIM	Nepomuk?

NEPOMUK	REAX Oh, wait, spare me. You horrible giant.

JIM	ATMER Nepomuk.

NEPOMUK	I'm just a poor worm. A looser poor worm. Eh, how did you know my name?

NEPOMUK	Oh, that's nothing but a giant trick. ATMER Hah, but you'll never find ME! We half-dragons are like masters of disguise. LAUTE

JIM	Nepomuk. I can still see you.

NEPOMUK	Hah?

JIM	Lu-uke!


NEPOMUK	Jim! Hey man, it‘s really is you. We, we gotta go. There's a horrible giant out there. We gotta pummel him to a pulp.

LUKAS	Nepomuk! Now that's what I call a surprise.

NEPOMUK	LAUTE There he is!

TURTUR	LAUTE

JIM	Nepomuk. He's a mock-giant. In reality, he's not so big.

TURTUR	LAUTE

JIM	He's just as scared of you as you of him.

NEPOMUK	He's afraid? Of me? A huge, hideous giant?

LUKAS	He probably thinks you‘re a real dragon.

NEPOMUK	Really?

TURTUR	LAUTE

NEPOMUK	Oh, uhmm. Could you, ya know, maybe be a little more scared of me, just like an itty-bitty bit more

NEPOMUK	'cause for real no one was ever really scared of me and that's, well ATMER really awful for, you know, a dragon. Hehehe...
JIM	LACHER

LUKAS	ATMERLAUTE

LUKAS	Okay that's enough talk about scariness- If you're afraid of each other there's no chance of you two ever becoming friends.

NEPOMUK	Friends?(Laute)

TURTUR	[Laute][Friends?]

LUKAS	Yeah, friends. Believe it or not you have a lot in common.

NEPOMUK	Oh yeah?

TURTUR	[Oh yeah?]

JIM	Of course. You're a dragon, who isn't really a dragon...

NEPOMUK	REAX

JIM	And you're a giant, who isn't really a giant. So you're both...

TURTUR	[Laut]

LUKAS	...one of a kind.

TURTUR	If you're one of a kind, then you're by yourself the whole time.

NEPOMUK	Oh, yeah.

TURTUR	EINATMER Please, excuse me, if I scared you. I'm sorry about that.

NEPOMUK	LAUTE Ach. Don't worry about it! Hah! Gotta say it's amazingly hot and dry in your oasis.

TURTUR	Oh, thank you. The only problem is the sand; that's a bit much sometimes.

NEPOMUK	OFF Oh, believe you me!

NEPOMUK	Can you hear my teeth grating? He he- Personally I prefer fresh lava. Ahh scrumptious, and healthy too! I can give you a some recipes if you want.

TURTUR	OFF Oh yes, that is very interesting.

LUKAS	REAX

JIM	REAX

TURTUR	CONT There is nothing better in the desert, than fresh fig-coffee with coconut milk, date biscuits (VAR cookies), pineapple rings and nut butter.

NEPOMUK	VORFREUDE-LAUTE

TURTUR	And for you my fine friend I have something special roasted desert sand. Yeah...

NEPOMUK	(Laute)Eh...

NEPOMUK	Oh, thank you. LACHEN & ESSEN

TURTUR	REAX

LUKAS	Oh, this is exquisite. To be honest, you gotta make this for our friends in Morrowland, I mean it. Ms Whaat 'd be over the moon.

JIM	REAX

NEPOMUK	LAUTE

TURTUR	Morrowland. I've spent so much time thinking - how lovely it's gotta be there.

NEPOMUK	[Laute]

LUKAS	LAUTE

JIM	Mr Turtur. Would you like to accompany us - to Morrowland?

NEPOMUK	[Laute]

TURTUR	Should I -? Accompany you - ATMER - to Morrowland?

TURTUR	+ LAUTE

JIM	We urgently need a light house. So the ships don't run aground in the fog and crash into our island.

JIM	With a light in your hand, you could do that.

LUKAS	And you'd never be alone again.

TURTUR	But the people there they wouldn't be afraid of me?

LUKAS	M-mh.

JIM	Morrowland is way too small. You could never be far enough away to scare anyone.

TURTUR	LAUTE

LUKAS	So, what do you think.

TURTUR	Esteemed friends, I - Yeah, a thousand times yes I thank (ins OFF) you both. Thank you so, so much.

LUKAS	OFF Good . At daybreak we should be headin' out- when the heat isn't that strong.

TURTUR	That's a good idea, Mr. Luke. The Fata Morgana's here (.) have been getting worse and worse.

JIM	The Fata Morgana – do they ever show the truth sometimes too?

TURTUR	They're deceitful, Jim. Mostly innocent travellers are lured into their doom, but sometimes -

TURTUR	they show us the past, what it looked like... Or reveal something about our future to us.

LUKAS	OFF Jim. The complete mandalan fleet is after the Wild. I'm tellin' you their days are numbered.

JIM	But they always escaped. (them) And what if they're kidnapping kids to bring them to Sorrowland?

NEPOMUK	What? No! You have to stay away from Sorrowland.

NEPOMUK	Since you beat Ms Grindtooth the dragons are crazy irate. If they find you then - they'll roast you alive on a spit.

JIM	[Atmer]

LUKAS	Why did you leave your volcano, Nepomuk?

JIM	They made you leave, didn’t they?

NEPOMUK	They - they somehow found out, that I helped you all.

NEPOMUK	ATMER And they wanted - LAUTE - they wanted me to tell them your names. And then - then they called me a traitor and banished me.

NEPOMUK	They took my beloved volcano away from me... LAUTE

JIM	(Nasenatmer)We have to make this right.

LUKAS	He needs a place where he can be safe from these beasts.

JIM	A place where it's nice, hot and dark, and far away from Sorrowland.

LUKAS	The Gurumusch Magnet Rock

JIM	Yeah!

LUKAS	That is genius, Jim!

JIM	REAX

NEPOMUK	LAUTE

NEPOMUK	[Laut]

LUKAS	LACHEN

JIM	[Lachen]

NEPOMUK	LAUTE What

LUKAS	I don't know, Jim. It's a very big responsibility. Should we try it with him?

NEPOMUK	Yeah! You can try it with me. And I'll behave, I promise. Please please please please. What's this about, anyway?

JIM	The Gurumusch Magnet Rock needs a new guard.

LUKAS	A dreadful rock, in the savage Barbarian Sea. It's ugly - and very hot there. And incredibly dirty.

NEPOMUK	LAUTE I could drill my very own lava-well there. Usually only the big and mean dragons have that give me a chance.

LUKAS	Hm?

JIM	Mhm.

NEPOMUK	I won't disappoint you I promise.

LUKAS	Good - then we agreed on it.

NEPOMUK	Yeah!!!

TURTUR	LAUTE

LUKAS	[Lachen]

TURTUR	[Laut]

NEPOMUK	Oh! This is amazingly ugly!

LUKAS	Well, take a look around

NEPOMUK	Yeah. Oh man, you gotta see this! Ee- brilliant. It stinks here!

SURSULAPITSCHI	Hey, you've come back.

JIM	Sursulapitschi! We found a new guard for the Aquatic lights!

NEPOMUK	Oh! Whoa! Check this out!

SURSULAPITSCHI	LAUTE

LUKAS	Nepomuk, come here for a sec.

NEPOMUK	Coming! Hah hah hah, man, you gotta check - ARGH! A water creature.

SURSULAPITSCHI	LAUTE A fire creature?

NEPOMUK	Yeah, I'm like soo a vicious and terrible dragon.

SURSULAPITSCHI	Be off, you horrible monster.

NEPOMUK	Oh, thank you for the compliment.

SURSULAPITSCHI	Fire creatures are evil from head to toe.

LUKAS	Whoa whoa wait a moment what's going on here anyway.

NEPOMUK	Hallo? Fire and Water - are like the biggest enemies.

SURSULAPITSCHI	They teach uns that in Mer school for example.

LUKAS	Did one of you ever meet a fire- or water creature for real?

NEPOMUK	Uh, actual-- ,uhm, uhm. No.

LUKAS	Then maybe it's time for you to develope your own opinion.

JIM	Our Emma, for example, couldn't drive without fire and water.

LUKAS	And Nepomuk? Your mother wasn't she a hippo?

NEPOMUK	Eh, hm, mh.

LUKAS	You yourself are half a water- creature.

TURTUR	There is nothing better than a refreshing bath (.) in water.

NEPOMUK	Real dragons bathe like never, and don't you forget that becau- oh---

SURSULAPITSCHI	REAX

NEPOMUK	Oh I  Hell--  Help I, uh I ,I I'm swimming. I'm swimming. I can swim.

NEPOMUK	[Laute]

SURSULAPITSCHI	The Crystal of Eternity. ATMER Sir Dragon, may I.

NEPOMUK	Uh, like what do I care? Go for it.

SURSULAPITSCHI	ATMER

SURSULAPITSCHI	We‘ve been looking for this, my beloved and I, for  hundred years. We can get married now.

LUKAS	SCHMATZ

JIM	Luke. Luke? The Wild , they kidnapped Molly.

TURTUR	[Laut]

LUKAS	That's not posiible.

LUKAS	"Dsim and Luxs - tratters hu sleed ms green toot." They mean traitors who slew.

LUKAS	"you vil regrat turdleing did tousand tims over (Jim and Luke - traitor who slew ms grindtooth, you will regret terrible deed thousand times over.)

JIM	The Wild  know what we did to Ms Grindtooth.

LUKAS	These boys are starting to get on my nerves. ATMER We will get Molly back. I promise you.

JIM	But how?

LUKAS	The Golden Dragon of Wisdom must be awake by now. It can answer any questions we have and I'm sure this one too.

LUKAS	Excuse me, miss, I know you want to find your Beloved, please do us a big favor.

SURSULAPITSCHI	LAUTE

LUKAS	Our friend Mr. Turtur here has to travel to a little island named Morrowland.

SURSULAPITSCHI	I'll go get a carriage. And the fastest sea horses to be found.

JIM	And what'll happen to Urshurishoom?

SURSULAPITSCHI	I've already waited  years. What's yet another day? I would love to help you all.

LUKAS	Farewell my creatures of the see. And Nepomuk, remember what we talked about. If a ship gets too close then you go down the rock shaft and...


NEPOMUK	and turn the Magnet off. Don't worry, dude, Sursa-Lursa and the Shroomy Usher can help me.(Lachen)

SURSULAPITSCHI	Sursulapichi and Urshurishoom

KAISER	My dear, honorable friend, rescuer of my daughter.

LUKAS	Ping Pong, my little friend, you'ver really grown.

PING PONG	(Atmer) Jim! Luke. Honorable engine drivers -

PING PONG	of a very distinguished locomotive.

KAISER	What brings you here, my friends. I can see from your faces that the occasion is not a happy one.

JIM	The Wild  kidnapped Molly

LUKAS	It's time someone teaches these boys what good manners are.

PING PONG	Our best warships are hunting those pirates. But they're faster than the wind.

JIM	Maybe the dragon can help us. How is she doing, Ping Pong?

PING PONG	I personally watched over her sleep, Jim.

PING PONG	At the hour of the monkey, when I was sent to bed, our best men took over the watch.

PING PONG	I selected each one personally with the utmost care.

LUKAS	Can you bring us to her?

PING PONG	Follow me, my friends.

PING PONG	Come on, my friends, come on.

FRAU MALZAHN	[Laute]

JIM	Ms. Grindtooth. Golden Dragon of Wisdom. Please wake up.

FRAU MALZAHN	Well, then. You have come. Those, whom I call, my Masters.

FRAU MALZAHN	The riddle shall be solved.

LUKAS	Dragon, do you know what our plans are?

FRAU MALZAHN	It was me - who had powerful empires sink into the deep sea - I see all - that transpires in this rounded sphere. I see it all.

LUKAS	Then tell us how we can find the Wild  for starters.

FRAU MALZAHN	Outfit a ship with weapons, and paint it with blue color - like the waves of the ocean.

FRAU MALZAHN	Thus disguised and hard to detect, set adrift in wind and wave.

FRAU MALZAHN	If but one time you are impatient, or headstrong, and take the helm, you will miss the place you seek.

FRAU MALZAHN	The wind will guide you - until you spy the blood-red sails.

FRAU MALZAHN	Be aware that the Wild  are a merciless crew - and have never been vanquished.

FRAU MALZAHN	They hail from the unconquerable fortress of Storm- eye from the horrible Land - That must Not – be.

JIM	Will we win the battle?

FRAU MALZAHN	The victor shall be vanquished, the defeated one will be victorious.

FRAU MALZAHN	Amidst the eye of the storm, you will see a star before you. Red, like blood, with five points.

FRAU MALZAHN	Grab the star, and make yourself it's master.

FRAU MALZAHN	Thus will the secret of your parentage be revealed to you. AUSATMER

JIM	Luke, uh, did you understand all that?

LUKAS	No. But the dragon has helped us once before. We should believe what it says.

PING PONG	Honorable friends, you need a ship. And arms.

PING PONG	Your imperial majesty, with your gracious permission, I'll take care of everything.

KAISER	Let's give our friends all the help they need, Ping Pong.

PING PONG	I'm hurrying, I'm flying.

FRAU MALZAHN	[Atmer]

LI SI	Golden Dragon of Wisdom. I have never seen anything so beautiful in my life.

FRAU MALZAHN	Princess Li Si.

LI SI	Forgive me. I did not want to wake you.

FRAU MALZAHN	Once you were a pupil in my school back in Sorrowland. Now it is your improbable fate - to come to your rescuers aid.

FRAU MALZAHN	"All that is odd shall be made even" - thus written in the books of old. Are you prepared for this?

LI SI	That I am, Golden Dragon.

PINSELER CHINESISCH	Hey, watch what you're doing, will you?

KAPITAEN	OFF That is very unusual.

LI SI	Papa! Papa, it spoke with me. It gave me a message for Jim.

LI SI	I don't understand it, but with a little time, I wíll be able to decipher it.

KAISER	You went to see the dragon again? Did you forget I told you not to?

LI SI	I must go with Jim. No one else but me can deliver the message.

KAISER	I almost lost you once. A second time my old heart couldn't bear.

LI SI	This is about something much bigger. Let me go with them, please.

KAISER	Captain, from now on my daughter is prohibited aboard your ship. Anyone who lets her aboard must be severly punished.

KAPITAEN	As you wish, your majesty.

LI SI	I won't let you stop me. You can't order me around anymore.

JIM	We have to do it exactly as the dragon told us to.

KAPITAEN	Have you ever heard anything like that? Orders from a dragon? I'm the captain. And I say enough of this nonsense. ATMER

KAPITAEN	No matter. I am taking command now.

LI SI	Didn't you hear what Jim said, captain? We have to follow what the dragons said to the letter.

KAPITAEN	Turn the ship around. We're taking the princess home.
LI SI	No. You won't do that.

LI SI	You musn't destroy everything we've accomplished now that the goal is so close.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO, IGNAZIO W , LUDOVICO	LACHEN W 

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Jim Button, ( ON ) we were firmly intending to die without sayin' a word.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Should we ever be vanquished, that's the end of the Wild , we swore that on our mother's grave.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	We're wild fellows, we are. but we know generosity when we see it.

FERNANDO W	[Laute]

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	We'll give you your freedom, and shall bring you all back to your homeland.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	And when we have fulfilled our vow, we'll set sail for the far north, and let ourselves be frozen in the everlasting ice.

W , LUDOVICO W ,	Yeah!!!(Lachen) MAXIMILIANO W

LI SI	No! Your fate is a different one. Jim - the dragon gave me a last message for you.

LI SI	Now, I finally understand it. Thousands of years ago, the rage of the dragons sank the beautiful land of Jamballa - under the waves of the sea.

LI SI	Ever since it has lain on the bottom of the ocean - hidden from the eyes of mankind.

LI SI	In its stead stands the Land That Mustn't be, which goes against the natural order of things.

LI SI	There, in the bowels of Stormeye Castle...you will find twelve copper doors.

LI SI	OFF Open all twelve doors at once

FRAU MALZAHN	OFF There, in the bowels of Stormeye Castle...you will find twelve copper doors

FRAU MALZAHN	OFF Open all twelve doors at once

FRAU MALZAHN	OFF and the water will gush in, sinking the Land That Mustn't Be. So that Jamballa can rise from the deep of the sea again.

FRAU MALZAHN	It is a deed full of terror, and only the twelve who thought they were thirteen possess the strength and courage to do it.

FRAU MALZAHN	What was bound will be free, what was foe will be friend, and that what was odd will be henceforth made even again for all eternity.


FRAU MALZAHN	Then and only then will Prince Myrrh enter his realm.

LI SI	Then and only then will Prince Myrrh enter his realm.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	The Twelve who thought they were thirteen? Hang me by the jib, blimey we are thirteen.

FERNANDO W,	Yes. LUDOVICO W 

NICOLO W 	Exactly.  men and a captain. KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	[Laut]

LUKAS	The captain was always one of your guys. That's why there's only  of you.

NICOLO W 	Only ? I don't get it

FERNANDO W	[Laute]

MAXIMILIANO W	Oh stupid arithmetic again..(	)(Laute)

JIM	You heard the words of the dragon. Only you can make it happen.

JIM	But's it's dangerous. It could spell your end.

KAPITAEN	We could make them.

JIM	They should do it, cause they want to do it.

JIM	[Laute]

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Come here. Come here.

LUDOVICO W 	What do you think, brothers??

MAXIMILIANO W	Good plan.

XAVERIO W 	Yeah? Are ya all in?

FERNANDO W	Hm.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Jim Button, we have sworn to bring you back to your homeland.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	And that is exactly what we‘ll do.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Hey, you guys, prepare the ship.

JIM	(Laut)It's a dead end here.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	The  doors, that the dragon was talking about, are down there. The gate hasn't been opened in ages.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Avast boys, get to work. Come on. Heave!

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO,	[Laute] MAXIMILIANONICOLOW

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Off you go.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Each of you take a door.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	Go back up to the surface. There's nothing you can do down here.

JIM	But…

LUKAS	He's right Jim. If it works we're gonna have to flee quickly.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	OFF Don't worry about us. The Wild  were vanquished only one time and that was from a fiendishly diabolical guy.(Lacher)

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	A little bit of water is not gonna bother us.

KAEPT ’ N W NTONIO	[Atmer]

JIM, LUKAS	[Reak]

LUKAS	It's nothing.

JIM	Friends don't lie to friends. You said so yourself.

LUKAS	It's not so long ago, it seemd like there wasn't enough space on Morrowland. Now we'll have too much space.

JIM	What do you mean by that?

LUKAS	AUSATMER, Na well...When you go away - to Jamballa - ATMER - What will Morrowland be like, without you there. Hm?

KAPITAEN	Hail and Cloudbursts. If that's a tiny island, them I'm a flea.

LUKAS	That's impossible. We must have gotten off course somehow.

KAPITAEN	Our course is dead right. I checked it myself.

JIM	Look Luke. That is...

LUKAS	… Morrowland

LI SI	This is what the dragon predicted. The Land that must not be will sink - and Jamballa will rise from the sea.
