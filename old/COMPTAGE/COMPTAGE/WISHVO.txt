??	Time for a little celebration.

??	Your timing  is not great, Kevin.

??	I was about to  jump in the shower, and I can't  be late for this meeting.

??	It's the last one  before we sign,

??	and I don't want to be  the one holding us up.

??	Well, that's what  the champagne is for.

??	Look, your divorce  is almost final,

??	and the fact that you have to go  to that bitch's office is more  than cause for fortification.

??	Since I have no intention  of giving into what he wants,  you're probably right.

??	He's the one that left.  What else more could he want?

??	A couch and a baseball.

??	Whatever.  The guy's a jerk.

??	You shouldn't have to  give him another thing.

??	So come on,  one drink?

??	Okay. Give me five minutes  to shower,

??	and I'll have a glass  while I get ready.

??	Perfect.

??	Can I watch?

??	Maybe.

??	Hey.  Hi.

??	Yeah.

??	Hello, Paul.

??	Have a date later?

??	No, I already did actually.

??	Of course you did.  How is our neighborhood jackass?

??	That's enough, Paul.  Take it easy,  both of you.

??	Where is your attorney?

??	Apparently he had  a family emergency,

??	so his associate  is filling in.

??	Of course.

??	Dane Andrews.  There this way.

??	Thank you.

??	You must be Lisa Miller.

??	Oh, Dane Andrews,  fillin' in for Matthew Lane  while he's in Texas.

??	I think I've heard  your name before.

??	Weren't you just  made partner at  Keller and Associates?

??	Yeah, that's me.

??	Congratulations.  That's a good firm.

??	- Welcome.  - Oh, thank you very much.

??	Um--

??	Okay.  Okay.

??	So, from what Matty tells me,  it's a pretty straightforward  dissolution...

??	between our clients.

??	A dispute over a few items.

??	So the items  in question are a couch,

??	a piece of furniture  of some sort...

??	and a collectable  of sentimental value.

??	There's no reason  she should keep  that signed baseball.

??	Except my dad  gave it to us.

??	 [ Groans ]  I want this to be over.

??	Listen, if both of you  cannot come to an agreement...

??	over the disputed items,

??	a judge is going to  put 'em up for auction.

??	You don't really  want to have to mess  with all that,

??	so we need to just kind of  work on an agreement  right here.

??	Not gonna happen.

??	Not on his terms.

??	Sell of the house--

??	it closes in a week, right?

??	The items up for dispute  still in this house?

??	They'd better be.

??	Yes.

??	Dane	Where are you living  these days, Paul?

??	At a friend's.

??	Dane	A friend's?

??	The guest bedroom  in the house still has  a bed in it, right?

??	Yeah.  Yeah, that's what  I thought.

??	Here's what I propose.

??	Paul, you move  back into the house...

??	the last week  before the house  closes for escrow.

??	And in this week,  you and Lisa  can talk things through,

??	work out your differences  over these two items  that are such a big deal.

??	And at the end of the week,  if we still don't have  an agreement,

??	we have an unsigned petition,  we can go ahead  and take that to the judge,

??	settle this in court.

??	No way am I  moving back in with her!

??	Counselor, you're aware  that Judge Daniels is supposed  to see this case, right?

??	Can I take a moment  to speak privately  with my client?

??	Of course.  You take all the time  you need.

??	Who the hell  is that guy?

??	He's one of the most  ruthless litigators  in this city.

??	Is that supposed to  mean something to me?

??	It means that  he's giving you one chance...

??	to talk Lisa  into giving you  the things you want.

??	Because if this divorce petition  goes to Judge Daniels  without a signature,

??	Dane Andrews will not only  make sure you get  none of those things,

??	he'll also get her  more alimony and a bigger split  from the sale of the house.

??	This is bullshit!

??	Wish it were.

??	He's that good.

??	Look,

??	I'm not happy about the idea  of you sharing a house  with that woman,

??	but I don't see any other way  for you to get the things  you want.

??	Pretty much the minute  Dane Andrews walked  through that door,

??	you were screwed.

??	Be charming enough  to get what you want from her,

??	but not  too----charming.

??	You're mine, remember?

??	Oh, right there.

??	You're gonna make me come  right now.

??	Right there.

??	Oh, right there.  Just like that.

??	You're gonna make me come.

??	Why should I let Paul  move back in my house?

??	Because you're still  in love with him.

??	No, I don't.

??	You don't even know me.

??	That's not true.

??	First of all--

??	But if we did--  [ Scoffs ]

??	You have no idea.

??	Oh, my God.  Listen, it says so right here.

??	What?  It doesn't say it here.

??	Not in so many words, no.

??	But the message  is still clear.

??	How?  How? Well, for one,

??	you let Paul  have the big-screen TV...

??	so that you could keep  your wedding ring.

??	So?  Maybe I want to sell it.

??	Yesterday was the first  sunny day we've had  all winter long,

??	and you spent it outside--  the tan's on your face,

??	as is the tan line from where  your wedding ring was until  you took it off this morning.

??	That doesn't prove anything.

??	You know, the baseball?  I get that.

??	Your father gave it to you.  It's got some sentimental value.

??	But the couch?

??	It's  years old,  and you care about that?

??	You gave up  the brand-new TV,  no problem.

??	But I love that couch.

??	I'm sure you love  that couch.

??	You guys bought your house  right before you got married.

??	You bought the couch  two weeks before that.

??	Now if I were to guess,  I would say that couch is  the first piece of furniture...

??	you two made love on  in the new house.

??	Am I right?

??	My client will require  that your client's lover...

??	does not come to the house  while he's staying there.

??	You can't do that.  How dare you say that!

??	I have no right?  That jackass better not  come anywhere near me.

??	Hey, have your client  arrive after : p.m.,  and my client will agree.

??	 [ Lawyer ]  Fine.

??	I think we're done  here today.

??	It was a pleasure  to meet you, Miss Samuels.

??	I look forward  to working together.

??	Me too.

??	You changed the locks,  so I'm gonna need a key.

??	Fine!

??	Listen, go home,  make love to your lover  one last time,

??	and then break it off.

??	You can't tell me--  Lisa,

??	you are still  in love with Paul.

??	And if you go home  and you go through this divorce,

??	you might regret it  for the rest of your life.

??	You can do that, or--  or you can take the risk that  maybe he still loves you too.

??	Okay, now I just bought you  a whole week.

??	I suggest  you use it wisely.

??	All right?  Okay.

??	Good luck.

??	Hey.  Hey.

??	So, are you done yet?

??	Let's go inside.

??	Oh.  Thanks.

??	Come on.  Sit down. Tell me.

??	It was hard.

??	My lawyer says  if we don't finish  dividing things up,

??	the judge can order us  to sell them.

??	Well, that doesn't  sound good.

??	What are you gonna do?

??	He also says he can stay here  while we sort it out.

??	And you said no, of course.

??	He's coming here after :.

??	What?  That's bullshit!

??	There's no reason  you and your ex-husband...

??	should ever have to be  in the same room as each other.

??	Come on.  What?

??	Just come with me.  Why?

??	What are you doing?  Changing the subject.

??	And you couldn't  have done that out there  in the other room on the couch?

??	Not there.

??	Why not?

??	Here...

??	or nothing.

??	Well, then I guess it's here.

??	Oh, my God.

??	Yes!

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah.

??	Oh, my God.

??	Kevin, you have to go.

??	It's your house.  Why can't I stay?

??	I want you to go.

??	But I don't want to.

??	I want you to.

??	

??	

??	So, leave now,

??	or leave for good?

??	I'm sorry, Kevin.  So that's it, huh?

??	He's coming back,  and you're just throwing me out.

??	Real nice, Lisa.  That's just awesome.

??	You know, the two of you  were meant for each other.

??	I am so glad you're moving...

??	because it wouldn't have  worked out between  the two of us anyway.

??	Sorry I was such an ass before.

??	I didn't know  he was gonna do that.

??	I know you didn't.

??	It's weird to see  the house so empty.

??	It's pretty empty  when you moved out.

??	And I had to pack  all the personal stuff 'cause  they had to show the house.

??	What's the buyer like?

??	It's a young couple.  They just got transferred here.

??	They've only  been married a year...

??	and it's  their honeymoon phase.

??	I liked the honeymoon phase.

??	Here.  Let me open this for you.

??	Oh, thank you.

??	So how's  your new shoe account?

??	Just as bad as  we knew they'd be.

??	How about that exec  that's been flirting with you?

??	You have no idea how  terrifying it is to be in  the same room with that woman.

??	She's like a black widow  who would eat her mate as soon  as she got what she wanted.

??	 [ Chuckles ]

??	How do you deal?

??	Skype meetings.  It's the only way to survive.

??	Cheers.  Cheers.

??	You look good.

??	I've been doing yoga.

??	Do tell.

??	Well, the girls at work  have been showing off  their butts,

??	so I had to give in.

??	Okay.

??	Stand up.

??	Turn around.

??	Definitely a yoga butt.  Thanks.

??	Kinda makes me want you.

??	Only kinda?

??	Way more than kinda.

??	Oh, my God.

??	Yeah. Yeah.

??	Yes.

??	Yes.

??	Yeah.

??	Was there ever anything  you wish we'd done,

??	you know, in bed?

??	I think we pretty much  covered almost  every part of the house...

??	the first month  we lived here.

??	 [ Chuckling ]  This couch was  my favorite though.

??	The movers had barely left  when we started ripping off  each other's clothes.

??	Mmm, you know where  we haven't tried?  The kitchen.

??	Come on. Really?

??	I thought for sure  I bent you over that counter  during a party.

??	Nope. Never did.

??	I must have just  fantasized about it then.

??	Anytime you bent over  to find a pot...

??	or reached under  for the bottom shelf,

??	I just wanted to come up  from behind you and bam!

??	Especially in the summertime.

??	You wore those short skirts.

??	What are we doing, Paul?

??	I'm not really sure, but...

??	it was probably a mistake.

??	I guess we should  head off to bed.

??	Good night, Lisa.

??	Night.

??	Morning.

??	Yeah, so?

??	I saw our neighborhood jackass  when I went to get the paper.  He didn't look too happy.

??	He's not.

??	Can't say  I'm too torn up about that.

??	Clearly you're not.

??	What are you doing?

??	Not being an idiot  like I was last night.

??	Ugh.

??	Damn.

??	I'm not exactly sure  what's going on with me, Lis,

??	but I like it here.

??	And you.

??	You look so damn hot  in those little shorts.

??	Well, I like it  that you're here too.

??	Why do you want  Dad's baseball  so much?

??	I loved your dad,  Lisa.

??	We actually used to  throw a baseball around  their backyard...

??	whenever you and your mom got  too intense with chick stuff.

??	It was a way we could talk  and still be, you know, guys.

??	Well, you were the son  he always wished he had.

??	We were playing catch  when he told me  about the cancer.

??	It was the first time  I ever dropped the ball.

??	I guess that why it means  so much that he left us  that baseball.

??	 [ Cell Phone Rings ]

??	Yeah?

??	No. No.

??	No big deal.

??	Yeah.

??	Seriously, Kim,  everything is fine.

??	No. She hasn't agreed yet,  but I'll get her there.

??	I know how to be charming  when I have to be.

??	Don't worry about it.

??	If I play my cards right,  I might even get the baseball  and----the couch.

??	Yeah. Me too.

??	Hey, where you going?

??	Out.

??	I thought we can talk today.

??	You mean  you----could talk...

??	and tell me all the bullshit  about how much  you love my family...

??	and that I would be  so in love with you...

??	and I would give you  whatever you want,

??	no questions asked?

??	- Lisa--  - Don't.

??	Where you going?  I'm getting  the hell out of here.

??	We're not done talking.

??	I'll tell you what.

??	If you're here  when I get back,  then we'll talk.

??	Crap.

??	What are you doing here?

??	I was worried about you.

??	You're worried about me?  Yeah.

??	I don't like  that you're here.

??	I want you home with me.

??	You're the one  that told me I had to do this.

??	Doesn't mean  you have to like it.

??	You think I like being here?

??	Well, she's not home,  so you're not negotiating  right now.

??	And yet here you are  lounging around like  you still own the place.

??	Why are you here, Kim?

??	Just leave the freaking couch  and baseball here.

??	Come home  and be with me.

??	It's not like that stuff  is even valuable.  Just leave it.

??	It's valuable to me.

??	More valuable than me,  obviously.

??	Either come home now,  or don't bother coming home.

??	Uh, don't do this.

??	Choose.

??	Good-bye, Kim.

??	Are you serious?

??	You're choosing  a damn couch over me?

??	Yeah, I guess I am.

??	You realize her lawyer  is going to sweep the floor  with you.

??	In fact,  she's probably over there  fucking him right now.

??	It's time for you to leave.

??	Can I come in?  - Yeah, of course.

??	I gotta be honest.  I'm kind surprised  to see you here.

??	I know.  It's totally inappropriate  for me to be here.

??	But honestly  I thought Lisa Miller  would be here.

??	Last time I saw Lisa Miller  was at your office.

??	Yeah, about that.

??	It was pretty unorthodox  for you to suggest that Paul  move in with her for the week.

??	Listen, sometimes that's  the best way to get people  to really start talking.

??	It's just stuff though.

??	Kim, it's a marriage.

??	That's funny.  I thought it was a divorce.

??	Listen, I'm sorry that things  didn't work out  with you and Paul, okay?

??	But--

??	It was a mistake  for me to come here.

??	I'm sorry.

??	No. Hey, hey, hey.

??	It wasn't a mistake.  I'm glad you came, okay?

??	Come here.

??	Oh, fuck.

??	Yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Hi.

??	I thought  you'd be gone by now.

??	Do you want me  to go?

??	No.

??	You know the conversation  we sort of started last night?

??	Mmm. You mean  before or after you told me...

??	having sex with me  was a mistake?

??	I said that, huh?

??	Yes, you did.

??	For the record,  I never meant sex with you  was a mistake.

??	That's comforting.

??	The conversation  I'm talking about was the...

??	"did you ever   wish we had" one.

??	You mean a sexual  bucket list for our marriage?

??	Yeah. Something like that.

??	And?

??	And, uh, I've been  thinking about it.

??	Really?  You said we never  had sex in the kitchen.

??	We didn't.

??	Well, let's.

??	So you're telling me  the first time was a mistake,

??	and anything after that  is fine?

??	Sex with you  has never been a mistake.

??	Especially when  you're using it  to get what you want.

??	What are you  talking about?

??	This morning.  I heard you talk  with your lawyer.

??	I guess the conversation  qualifies as...

??	charming,  sweet-talking, huh?

??	That's why you bolted?

??	I'm tired of  always being hurt.

??	When we separated,  I told myself,  from here on out,

??	I'd be the first one  to leave.

??	Which you did quite effectively  when you took up a jackass  across the street.

??	At least he wants  to be with me.

??	What the fuck is this?

??	- I can explain.  - [ Scoffs ]

??	Don't even bother.

??	I don't even know why  I even am surprised  she was here.

??	But on my couch?

??	My----couch.

??	Why did you fuck her  on that couch?

??	I didn't!  Bullshit!

??	She came here this afternoon  and tried to get me  to leave with her, okay?

??	But you dared me to stay,  so I did.

??	I dared you to?

??	That wasn't a dare.  That was an accusation...

??	that you were too weak  to hang in there  when things got tough.

??	You know I told you  the first time  I dropped that ball...

??	was when your dad  told me about his cancer?

??	The second time  was when I let you hide behind  your grief after he died.

??	 [ Clears Throat ]  I didn't fight for you  hard enough.

??	And I let you slip away.

??	I dropped that ball.

??	But not anymore.

??	I'm not letting go  of your dad's baseball because  I'm not letting go of you.

??	You don't think  I want you?

??	Where'd you go today?  None of your business.

??	Did you go to see him?  - Fuck off.

??	No. Where did you go?

??	Where'd you go?

??	I went to see my dad.

??	You went to the cemetery?  Why?

??	I asked if it was okay  if you'd have his baseball.

??	Oh, baby.

??	It's not the baseball I want.

??	It's you.

??	There shouldn't be  any regrets.

??	None.

??	Mmm.

??	
O??	h, my God. Yeah.

??	Oh, yes.

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah!

??	Oh, fuck.

??	Let me guess.  I'm fired.

??	Get in here.  Come on.

??	You were right.

??	I still love him.

??	So the baseball  and the couch  still have a home?

??	Actually, no.

??	Our house just closed  and we're looking for  a new place to live.

??	But it's perfect  because it's time for  a change of scenery.

??	And new neighbors.

??	So what's the secret?  You guys look like  you're still on your honeymoon.

??	A bucket list
