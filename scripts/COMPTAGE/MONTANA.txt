PETER	I saw that, Sara.

SARA	Oops. Don’t tell my boss I was too busy to bake anything.

PETER	Your secret is safe with me. But only if I get the first one.

SARA	Done.

PETER	I need your help with something. Carson Ranch.

SARA	The cattle ranch in Montana?

PETER	Mm-hmm. That’s the one. They need to take out a second loan to cover their losses from the drought.

SARA	Yeah, a lot of farms and ranches really suffered out there.

PETER	They did, they did. The problem is, this loan isn’t going to be approved unless the Carson’s can show they can make the payments. Right now, they’re barely breaking even.

SARA	So they need to cut their costs or increase their income.

PETER	Yeah. You tell that to Travis Carson. He’s as stubborn as they come. He wants to do things his own way.

SARA	Have you done a site visit?

PETER	Actually, that’s where you come in. I want you to go.

SARA	Aren’t site visits a “V.P.” thing?

PETER	Mm-hmm. Sara, you’re one of the best financial advisors we have... and we think you’d make an even better V.P. This is your chance to show it.

SARA	Thank you, Peter. I appreciate the opportunity more than you know. But full disclosure... I know nothing about ranching.

PETER	That’s exactly why I want you to go. You can analyze this business from a fresh perspective. Maybe find a solution that we didn’t think of..

SARA	Okay then, of course I’ll go. So are you thinking early January--

PETER	We can’t wait that long. This loan needs to close by Christmas. I need you to go tomorrow. Well, I can book a return flight for the 23rd. So no matter what happens, you’ll be home for Christmas. Sara, what’s wrong? This is a great opportunity.

SARA	It is. It’s just, Chloe’s Christmas break starts tomorrow.

PETER	Oh, well bring her with you! Look, I know that ever since Rob passed away, Christmas has been rough on you and Chloe...

SARA	It just hasn’t had the same feeling to it.

PETER	Well, right. So maybe a change of scenery would help. They’ve got plenty of that in the Big Sky state. Come on, I’m sure Chloe will love it.

CHLOE	Do I have to come with you?

SARA	It’s just for a couple of days, Chloe.

CHLOE	But Montana’s, like, the wilderness! What if there’s no Wi-Fi?

SARA	I think you have the wrong idea about what Montana is like.

CHLOE	Do you know what it’s like?

SARA	No. But tomorrow we’re both going to find out.

CHLOE	Is your jacket working?

SARA	Apparently not! Okay, come on, sweetie.

KAY	Welcome to Kay’s Place.

SARA	Nice to meet you. I’m Sara Bradley, and this is my daughter Chloe.

CHLOE	Hi.

KAY	Oh, you two look freezing. Come on in, sit down, please, while I get you checked in. And I’ll bring some hot cider and some homemade fruitcake.

CHLOE	Thank you.

KAY	Well?

CHLOE	I’ve actually never had fruitcake before. So this is officially the best fruitcake I’ve ever had.

KAY	I like you.

SARA	Thank you.

CHLOE	Oh, do you have a Wi-Fi password?

KAY	Oh, we don’t have Wi-Fi.

CHLOE	I told you!

KAY	I’m joking. It’s “StarBigSkyChristmas!”

SARA	Even your Wi-Fi is Christmas-y.

KAY	I wouldn’t have it any other way.

SARA	Chloe, please don’t be on your phone the whole time.

CHLOE	You’re going to be working. I don’t know what else to do.

KAY	Go down to the end of the block, turn right. there’s a lot of cute holiday shopping.

SARA	It was nice of Kay to loan us that hat and these mittens.

CHLOE	Yeah. Except they don’t have the little thingy on the fingertip to use on touch screens.

SARA	You say that like it’s a bad thing.

CHLOE	Oh Mom, let’s look over here.

SARA	Sure.

HANDSOME MAN	Hello! Welcome to St. Nick’s Knick Knacks.

SARA	Wow, that’s the best name for a Christmas shop ever.

HANDSOME MAN	Well, it use to be called “Jeff’s Christmas Hut”, but that didn’t catch on.

SARA	Oh sweetie, that’s so pretty. You could put that on your charm bracelet.

CHLOE	Oh that-- that’s okay, I don’t wear that anymore.

HANDSOME	Uh, can I help you find something else? A candy cane, perhaps? Or, oh, better – this candy cane. Right? Beautiful. Locally made. No, wait. Better. Artisanal.

SARA	Which is another word for expensive.

HANDSOME MAN	As freakishly large candy canes go, it’s a bargain.

SARA	You’re a really good salesman.

HANDSOME MAN	Thank you. Not even my booth. Or my job. I’m just filling in for a friend’s wife.

SARA	That’s really nice of you.

HANDSOME MAN	That’s how we do things around here.

SARA	Well, you seem to have a knack for it.

HANDSOME MAN	Nailed it.

HANDSOME MAN	Wow, in the St. Nick of time.

SARA	Oh yeah, there was a line.

HANDSOME MAN	Too far?

SARA	Yeah.

HANDSOME MAN	Okay.

SARA	You just went right over that line.

HANDSOME MAN	I think it worked.

SARA	I thought it was funny.

CHLOE	Look mom, chocolate.

SARA	Oh, I guess I’m going this way.

HANDSOME MAN	Yeah, have a Merry Christmas.

SARA	You too!

CHLOE	Wow. This is not how I pictured it.

SARA	It’s beautiful.

POPS	Afternoon! Welcome to Carson Ranch.

SARA	Thank you. I’m Sara Bradley, from Mayer/Hall. I’m looking for Travis Carson?

POPS	Right name, wrong generation. You’re looking for my son, Travis Junior. And are you Ms. Bradley’s executive assistant?
CHLOE	No. Her daughter.

POPS	Well, I’m glad to meet you both. Well, let’s find out where he is, huh? Beautiful day, much warmer than yesterday.

SARA	This place is incredible, Mr. Carson.

POPS	Oh, call me “Pops.” Oh, hold tight. I’ll get you some hot cocoa.

CHLOE	Wow, luckily people in Montana like serving warm beverages.

POPS	Okay, here you go.

SARA/CHLOE	Thank you.

POPS	Ah. Yeah, Junior’s on his way back.

POPS	Hey, our head ranch hand J.T.’s daughter’s about your age. Name’s Lexie. I think she’s out back helping with the horses. Why don’t I introduce you?

CHLOE	Okay.

POPS	Huh? Come on!

CHLOE	Why do you guys decorate the inside of the barn?

POPS	Oh, the horses love Christmas too. They like to pretend they’re reindeer.

POPS	Oh Lexie, there you are. This is Chloe. Her mom’s here doing a little business with us...

LEXIE	Hi. Do you want to help me brush the horses? I’ve actually never even pet a horse before.

LEXIE	It’s easy. Come on. She’s really gentle.

SARA	Well, go ahead.

CHLOE	Do I just circle it or--

LEXIE	Yeah, a circle.

CHLOE	Okay.

LEXIE	Oh, you got it.

CHLOE	Like this?
LEXIE	Yeah!

CHLOE	Aww, he’s so calm.

SARA	Oh, I have to take this.

SARA	Hi.

TRAVIS	Hi.

SARA	So this is where you really work.

TRAVIS	Yes, my career in “Christmas novelties” was short but sweet. What are you doing here?

SARA	Oh, I’m meeting with Travis Carson. He’s expecting me. I’m Sara Bradley.

TRAVIS	Oh. Travis Carson.

SARA	Really?

TRAVIS	Yeah, what were you expecting? A gigantic belt buckle and a lasso.

SARA	Of course not. Oh, let me help.

TRAVIS	Oh, thank you.

SARA	So I... I just-- I just want to say up front that we are on the same team. Okay? We uh, we both want you to get that loan approved. You know that right?

TRAVIS	And I just want to say that Peter’s recommendations to cut labor are a non-starter. Those men are my family.

SARA	Well, that’s why I’m here. To help you find a different way to get at the numbers you need to show the bank.

TRAVIS	And if you can’t?

SARA	I will. You know what? I just came over to say hello before we start tomorrow. I probably should get back to the inn and get some rest.

TRAVIS	Of course.

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	Looks good.

SARA	How’d it go?

CHLOE	Oh, it’s so fun.

LEXIE	It’s way better working with a friend.

CHLOE	Thanks for inviting me to help.

SARA	Oh. Chloe, this is Travis Carson Junior.

TRAVIS	Hello.

CHLOE	The knick-knack guy.

TRAVIS	I’m actually a rancher guy. And if I may, this is my horse, Rustler. He’s as gentle as they come.

CHLOE	Sorry. I’m still not really used to horses.

TRAVIS	That’s okay. Here’s the funny thing about Rustler, he loves Christmas music. He does. There he is. Give it a try.

CHLOE	Oh. No. It’s okay.

TRAVIS	Come on. Jingle bells, jingle...

CHLOE	...bells, jingle all the way --

TRAVIS	There you go. Good job, buddy. You have a real way with animals. You wanna help with the chicks in the back barn?
CHLOE	Can we go right now?

SARA	We should be getting back...

TRAVIS	Oh yeah. You gotta get back before rush hour.

SARA	Rush hour?!

TRAVIS	No, just some cattle crossing the road.

SARA	So, did you have fun today?

CHLOE	I guess.

SARA	What do you mean, “You guess?”

CHLOE	It was okay.


SARA	You don’t want to admit that I was right about Montana being an adventure. So does that mean you don’t want to go back to the ranch with me tomorrow?

CHLOE	I didn’t say that...

POPS	They don’t all have to be white lights, you know.

TRAVIS	Well that’s the way Mom always use to do it.

POPS	Doesn’t mean it’s set in stone. Nothing really is.

TRAVIS	We still talking about the lights or are we talking about how I run the ranch?

POPS	Something has to give, son. I know it’s not your fault that we’re in this pinch. Everyone’s trying to recover from the drought. But we really need that second loan, you know.

TRAVIS	Yeah.

POPS	I know it’s tough being the bad guy, but if it’s a decision between laying people off and losing everything
 
TRAVIS	No. We’re not laying anyone off. I prefer to sell part of the land.

POPS	Okay, then.

TRAVIS	Okay.

POPS	It can’t hurt to hear Sara’s ideas. And then you’re going to have to make a tough choice. Just like you did when you moved back here.

TRAVIS	Aw, that wasn’t a tough choice. I only moved away because I wanted to try something completely different from this life.

POPS	Well, corporate law is just about as different as it gets.

TRAVIS	Yes, it is. But after a while I realized I not only left home, I left who I was. My only regret is not coming home sooner, so I could spend time with Mom.

POPS	No, there’s nothing you could’ve done for Mom back then. Now, you’re keeping her Christmas traditions alive and well. But son, this ranch is running on fumes. You gotta make some changes or accept the fact that this could be the last Christmas we spend here. See? Sometimes changing things up makes what you already have, better. The lights are a metaphor.

TRAVIS	Oh, I get it. Dad. And I hear you.

POPS	I know you do.

TRAVIS	Morning.

SARA	Morning. Pops said it was okay if I brought Chloe because Lexie’s here.

TRAVIS	Yeah, that’s fine.

TRAVIS	She’s around back with the chickens.

CHLOE	Do they like Christmas carols too?

TRAVIS	They’re more into Classic Rock.

SARA	Have fun.

TRAVIS	Look, I meant everything that I said yesterday, but I suppose I need to let you do your job.

POPS	I talked some sense into him.

SARA	I owe you one.

POPS	Well come on, let’s go in.

TRAVIS	After you.

POPS	Your timing’s perfect. Kay just dropped off some of her famous Candy Cane Cocoa.

SARA	Kay... from the B&B?

POPS	Yeah, she’s an old friend. She’s always bringing by her home cooking from the inn.

SARA	Wow. That’s really nice of her.

POPS	Oh, people in town always are always coming by here at Christmas.

TRAVIS	Kay comes over a little more than most.

POPS	Have a seat. I’ll get you some cocoa.

SARA	Oh, can I get that to go? I’d really like to get started. Can we go to your office and dig into the books?

TRAVIS	Easy there. You don’t walk through someone’s front door and get straight to business. You’re on ‘Montana Time.’

SARA	What does that mean?

TRAVIS	Well, that means here, we don’t rush things. Especially at Christmas. We take our time to sit, chat, eat cookies, and drink candy Cane Cocoa, then we can start. Thank you.

SARA	Is that a snowman-shaped marshmallow?

POPS	Yeah, Kay makes ‘em special for the bonfire. And she gives me any extras, of course.

SARA	So, do you sell the cocoa at the bonfire?

POPS	Of course not. They’re friends. Oh, she dropped by some sausage rolls. Or have you already tried them at the inn?

SARA	Actually, I’m a vegetarian.

POPS	Oh, well, we won’t hold that against ya. I’ll go see if the girls want some cocoa.

SARA	I’m really glad that Chloe’s found a friend. It’s not easy being an only child. Especially when it’s just the two of us now.

TRAVIS	I bet.

SARA	How about you, any kids?

TRAVIS	Always wanted to. Christmas with my parents was probably the best time of my life. But... sometimes things don’t work out the way you planned.

SARA	Yeah, Chloe and I know that first hand. The other thing I know is that we have a lot of work to do.

TRAVIS	Wow. That was a terrible segue.

SARA	Wasn’t it? But seriously, umm, I’d like to start by digging into last year’s cash flow.

TRAVIS	Have you finished your cocoa?

SARA	No.

TRAVIS	You know the rules.

SARA	You’re not going to make this easy, are you?

TRAVIS	Nothing worth doing ever is.

SARA	Fine. Ready?

TRAVIS	I reckon I am.

SARA	Alright, let’s get started.

TRAVIS	This way.

SARA	Is this your office?

TRAVIS	No, this is a barn. I just wanted to give you a little tour before you bury yourself in the numbers. The ranch is about a lot more than just what’s on paper.

SARA	This is beautiful. How old is it?

TRAVIS	About a hundred-fifty years.

SARA	So, what do you do with it at Christmas?

TRAVIS	Ah, we host the annual Christmas Eve potluck. And, until then, it’s usually storage.

SARA	Well, I hate to tell you this, but you’ve been robbed.

TRAVIS	We haven’t set it up yet. We have eight days until Christmas Eve. And by then, this entire barn is going to be transformed into a Christmas wonderland. Everybody pitches in to set up the tables, the centerpieces, and even stage for the musicians...

SARA	That sounds expensive. So, what’s the overhead on this dinner?

TRAVIS	Zero. Everybody pitches in.

SARA	Have you ever considered renting this place out for weddings or special events?

TRAVIS	It’s not what this place is for.

SARA	It could be. Wow.

TRAVIS	Right? My mom collected these over all the years our family hosted the Christmas potluck. When she passed, I promised her that I would keep it going. I do hope this isn’t the last one.

SARA	I’ve already thought of a couple of ways to cut costs.

TRAVIS	Well, if those ways involve our Christmas traditions, you can forget it.

SARA	I would never ask anyone to give up Christmas.

TRAVIS	Isn’t that what you’re doing?

SARA	I’m just doing my job. And I’m going to need your help.

TRAVIS	And you’ll get it. Right after I do my job.

SARA	Are you going all the way up there?

TRAVIS	Well, unless you want to.

SARA	Maybe you could have one of the ranch hands do it and we go back to your office?

TRAVIS	Oh, they’re out getting feed, or moving the cattle, making sure the pipes are flowing... What are you writing down?

SARA	This is just valuable information about your day-to-day operations.

TRAVIS	Well, outside of Christmas, on any given day, I’d be working right alongside of them.

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	Write that down. That’s important. That’s a cowboy’s work ethic. That you wouldn’t ask anyone to do something you wouldn’t do yourself.

SARA	Got it.

TRAVIS	What?

SARA	It just seems like a waste of perfectly nice garland to put it all the way up on the rafters.

TRAVIS	Well, what do you suggest?

SARA	Well, a few years ago we did this zig-zag with garland to look like a Christmas tree all the way up the wall. We threaded in some lights and we put a star on top. It was really beautiful.

TRAVIS	Okay, that sounds interesting. You have any pictures?

SARA	Um… Oh no. That’s going back a while. We’ve tried to keep Christmas pretty low-key since my husband passed away.

TRAVIS	Oh, I didn’t know. I’m sorry. How long ago was it?

SARA	Four years. Sometimes it feels like a lifetime and sometimes it seems like it just yesterday.

TRAVIS	If this is too hard, we can go back to the office and do what you need to get done.

SARA	No, I’m okay. Let’s do that tree.

TRAVIS	Okay. Right.

SARA	Umm. Hey, actually;

TRAVIS	The garland.

SARA	This would be perfect.

TRAVIS	Yeah? Okay.

SARA	It’s not gonna take any time at all. Oh my gosh. Hey, what do you think about this?

TRAVIS	That’s a great bow.

SARA	We could do like-- you know, on your back. 

TRAVIS	I’m excited about just getting going, so.

SARA	I think you’re being low-key about it.

TRAVIS	I’m fired up.

SARA	Okay. Good.

SARA	Whoa, whoa. I’m fine.

TRAVIS	I can see that.

SARA	And you will be too.

TRAVIS	Thank you. I mean, this ranch means the world to my family and me.

SARA	I can see that.

TRAVIS	Okay, you should do honors. Here you go.

SARA	Oh, okay.

TRAVIS	You’re right. It looks amazing. Thank you.

SARA	You’re welcome. And now there’s plenty of time to go over your expenses.

TRAVIS	Oh wow. You jump back to work mode so fast, it gives me whiplash.

SARA	It’s been a long time since I saw snow fall.

TRAVIS	When was the last time it snowed in Los Angeles?

SARA	Umm, twenty years ago. Snowed just enough to make everything white... for about an hour.

TRAVIS	Hopefully this’ll stick around a little longer. Let’s go.

SARA	Hey.

TRAVIS	First time seeing snow, huh?

CHLOE	Unless you count the sledding hill they made for the winter dance at school.

TRAVIS	I don’t count that, no. But just wait, when the snow covers everything in sight and the Christmas lights reflect off of it... in that one quiet moment, the world new and perfect.

CHLOE	I like Montana snow better.

SARA	Are those the marshmallows Pops was talking about?

CHLOE	Kay let me and Lexie help. And then she taught us how to knit.

SARA	Wow! You have been busy! What are you knitting?

CHLOE	A tiny little Christmas scarf.

SARA	Kay, thank you for keeping her so busy.

KAY	I think I had more fun than they did.

POPS	Did you two get a lot done?

SARA	I’m just getting the feel for the place.

POPS	Well, in that case, I hope you can stay for lunch in a couple hours.

CHLOE	Mom, can we stay?

TRAVIS	Well, just as long as long as there’s no talking business at the table.

SARA	Well then we’re going to have to talk about it before lunch. There’s just enough time for me to go your most recent balance sheet.

CHLOE	Well, can I go visit the horses while you work?

SARA	Go ahead.

TRAVIS	Can I go too?

SARA	Funny.

TRAVIS	Let’s go.

TRAVIS	Ranching’s actually a lot more high-tech than most people think. With GPS, I can see where every single head of cattle is on the screen at one time.

SARA	This is not what I expected your office to look like.

TRAVIS	One second. How about now?

SARA	Yes! That’s what was missing! You know, I have never met anyone as into Christmas as you.

TRAVIS	Making up for lost time. I think when I left the ranch, I left Christmas behind too.

SARA	Where did you go?

TRAVIS	Law school.

SARA	You’re a lawyer?

TRAVIS	Was. Yeah. I was pretty good at it too. But it wasn’t what I was looking for.

SARA	What were you looking for?

TRAVIS	Something different. I mean, haven’t you ever wanted a change? Just to see if that’s where you were meant to be?

SARA	Not really. The reason I’m up for a promotion is because I stayed the course, I rose up through the ranks. There’s something to be said for stability.

TRAVIS	Yes, there is. And I had that in New York, but after a few years. I just had to admit I wasn’t happy. I missed every single thing about this place. Especially at Christmas.

SARA	You missed Christmas In New York City, the most Christmas-y place in the world?
TRAVIS	It wasn’t home.

SARA	Sometimes home is the hardest place to be at Christmas.

TRAVIS	Hmm, well in that case, I hope that someday you can bring Christmas home again. I’ll show you the balance sheets.

POPS	Okay, anything on a green plate is vegetarian.

SARA	That is so thoughtful. Thank you.

POPS	Oh, thank Kay. She put it together. Amazing in the kitchen, this one.

TRAVIS	Yeah, when Kay’s not around, things aren’t quite as gourmet.

SARA	I don’t know why I picture ranchers eating beans out of a tin pot.

TRAVIS	What?! That is a cliché? from a bad movie.

POPS	Son, remind me, what we had for supper last night?

TRAVIS	Beans.

POPS	Straight out of the pot.

TRAVIS	Well, you picture ranchers eating beans... I picture L.A. eating kale. Like, all the time.

SARA	Well, I guess we both have certain misconceptions...

CHLOE	Mom, you had kale chips on the plane.

SARA	Shhh!

POPS	So Chloe, what do you think of the ranch so far?

CHLOE	Um, it’s pretty cool.

SARA	Trust me. This is high praise.

POPS	You are here at the best time of the year. Some of the fondest memories of my life are from Christmas on this ranch.

TRAVIS	Me too, Dad. In fact, I get just as excited for Christmas now as I did when I was a kid.

SARA	When I was a kid, I loved that moment of seeing the Christmas tree all lit up, Christmas Eve, right before Santa came and I just wished that feeling could last forever.

TRAVIS	I know exactly how you feel.

KAY	What about you, Chloe? What’s your favorite Christmas memory?

CHLOE	Umm, just spending time with family.

POPS	That’s my favorite part, too.

TRAVIS	My absolutely favorite thing is actually happening tonight. It’s the Carson Ranch Christmas Bonfire. Sort of a gigantic camp out with family and friends. And it’s just joyful. I hope you and Chloe will join us.

KAY	You better save them front row seats in front of the fire. It’s going to be in the low-20’s tonight.

TRAVIS	Oh yeah, that’s right, you guys aren’t equipped for this.

SARA	So Chloe, I don’t think we have much choice. Either we stay indoors while I finish my work and we fly back to L.A.... or we go into town and get ourselves some new coats.

CHLOE	I vote coats.

TRAVIS	Well the snow’s coming down pretty hard. If you want, I can give you a lift into town.

SARA	Oh you don’t need to do that.

TRAVIS	Have-- have you ever driven in the snow?

CHLOE	We barely drive in the rain.

SARA	I don’t know about this coat.

TRAVIS	Here, try this one.

SARA	Oh!

CHLOE	How does anyone move around in these?

TRAVIS	Well, you figure it out.

SARA	Ah, I’m never taking it off.

TRAVIS	Excellent.

CHLOE	Actually, I like it. It feels like I’m wrapped in a thousand fuzzy blankets.

SARA	We’ll take these.

SARA	So back to the ranch?

TRAVIS	Uh no, we have one more errand to run.

TRAVIS	Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

SARA	You can’t possibly know all these people.

TRAVIS	Oh, I don’t. Don’t know that guy. Oh, no wait. I do.

TRAVIS	Merry Christmas, Stan!

TRAVIS	All right, load up. You know what they say. Cold hands, cold head--

SARA	Cold heart?

TRAVIS	Nah, just put it on or you’ll be super cold.

SARA	Here you go. Merry Christmas.

TRAVIS	Oh, that’s a hard pass.

SARA	You can’t say no, it’s a gift.

TRAVIS	Then thank you.

SARA	You’re welcome.

CHLOE	Oh, oh my goodness!

TRAVIS	Oh… Oh, you’re killing me.

CHLOE	I think it’s awesome.

TRAVIS	Thank you very much. Oh, look what I found.

CHLOE	No way.

TRAVIS	Turnaround is fair play.

SARA	It’s adorable.

CHLOE	It’s awful. Thank you.

SARA	What about me?

CHLOE	Oh, take this guy.

SARA	Oh, thank you. Oh, I actually look cute!

TRAVIS	You do! That’s disappointing.

SARA	Oooooh.

TRAVIS	Oh that’s horrifying.

SARA	It truly is.
CHLOE	It’s the worst! Oh, I actually really like these though. Can we get them?

SARA	Yeah, yeah. We can get these.

TRAVIS	I’ll grab you some mittens.

CHLOE	Thank you.

SARA	Sweet.

SARA	Thank you.

TRAVIS	Thank you.

TRAVIS	Slow down!

TRAVIS	She always walk so fast?

CHLOE	Yep. There’s nothing she hates more than a “stroll.”

SARA	Not when there’s so much to do. I’ve been researching regenerative soil techniques, modernization and there’s just a lot to think about.

TRAVIS	You really do care, huh?

SARA	I told you I did!

TRAVIS	Oh! We have one more thing to get.

CHLOE	Boots?

TRAVIS	Boots.

SARA	Boots.

KAY	Let’s pass these around?

LEXIE	Oh, Chloe. This is my mom and dad.

LEXIE'S MOM	Hey Chloe.

CHLOE	Hi. It’s great to meet you.

J.T.	Yeah, you too.

LEXIE	Let’s go roast these.

LEXIE'S MOM	Have fun.

SARA	You know you could make a lot of extra income by selling this right?

TRAVIS	That’s not what Christmas is about. I’m not going to take money from friends.

SARA	I get it.

TRAVIS	What?

SARA	Why this is your favorite thing. Everybody’s just out celebrating, nobody’s rushing, nobody’s stressed. It’s like everyone pressed pause for the night.

TRAVIS	You could do it too.

SARA	I can’t seem to get out of fast forward.

TRAVIS	Give it time. You’ll figure it out.

SARA	I don’t think we’ll be here long enough.

TRAVIS	Hi. Well, it’s almost time for Christmas carols. So what is your favorite?

CHLOE	Uh.. I don't know. We did Jingle Bells with the horse, so maybe Deck the Halls?

TRAVIS	Done. That would have been my pick.

STEPHEN	Travis.
TRAVIS	Hey. Oh hey! Sara and Chloe Brandly, this is my good friend Stephen. He runs the best restaurant in Big Fork.

STEPHEN	Pleasure, Ma’am.


TRAVIS	Sara is the financial advisor from California.

STEPHEN	Ohhhhh. Well, I could’ve guessed you weren’t from around here.

SARA	How?

STEPHEN	Umm, new duds.

SARA	Travis, I can’t believe you let me walk around with that tag hanging off my jacket this whole time.

TRAVIS	No! I didn’t notice! I swear! I promise! I promise!

CHLOE	Do you want to go see the marshmallows I roasted?

SARA	I would love to.

SARA	Nice to meet you.

STEPHEN	Likewise.

STEPHEN	Haven’t seen that look in your eye since you moved back from NYC...

TRAVIS	Oh, stop.

STEPHEN	I’m just saying, it’s nice to see.

SARA	This is perfect.

TRAVIS	It sure is.

CHLOE	Deck the halls with boughs of Holly...

EVERYONE SINGING	Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la. ‘Tis the season to be jolly, fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel, fa-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la. Toll the ancient yuletide carol, fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la.

KAY	Everything okay?

SARA	I’m just frustrated. I thought once I got here, a solution for the ranch would just come to me. It usually does.

KAY	Well, your first problem is, there’s nothing’s “quick” in Big Fork. And the second is you should be at the ranch for your inspiration, not here. Now go, get some sleep, I’ll drive you out in the morning.

SARA	That’s so nice. Thank you.

KAY	Think nothing of it.

POPS	Hey!

SARA	Hi!

KAY	Hello!

KAY	Good morning.

CHLOE	Hey, Pops.

KAY	So how are you fixed for egg nog?

POPS	Running a little low. Any chance you could find some time to whip up another batch?

KAY	Well, I can make time.

CHLOE	Hey Lexie.

LEXIE	Hey Chloe! I like your boots!

CHLOE	Thank you, they’re new.

KAY	How would you girls like to help me with the egg nog?

CHLOE	Yes!

LEXIE	Sure!

KAY	Okay, first though, we need some eggs.

CHLOE	Uh, where are you going? The kitchen’s that way.

LEXIE	Yeah, but the eggs are back there.

CHLOE	Oh, I don’t think I could do that.

LEXIE	You were great with the horses. Chickens are even easier. Come on.

SARA	Have fun.

SARA	I’m just going to have a look around the ranch.

WOMAN	Hey!

MAN	How you doing? 

SARA	Hi!

SARA	Wow, this place is coming along!

TRAVIS	Yeah, only four days until Christmas Eve.

CHLOE	Come on!

J.T.	Hey! Snowball fights outside only. And no sneak attacks.

LEXIE	Sorry dad. Come on, guys.

GIRL	Hey!

J.T.	Sorry about that, Ma’am. Kids are on break. J.T. Ryan. Head ranch hand.

SARA	Sara Bradley. Nice to meet you.

J.T.	I better go give Teddy some backup.

TRAVIS	Would you do me a favor and help me unbox these plates?

SARA	Sure. It’s amazing see the whole town enjoying your ranch.

TRAVIS	That’s what Christmas is all about.

SARA	I can see that. These are beautiful.

TRAVIS	Thank you. Some of them were my mom’s – passed down from three generations before that.

SARA	I bet she’d be proud to know that you are keeping up the tradition.

TRAVIS	Yeah. You know, that’s what I missed when I was in New York. It’s the things that make Christmas personal that are the things you look forward to the most. You know?

SARA	For me and Chloe, Christmas just became something to “get through” instead of something to celebrate.

TRAVIS	Have you ever spoken to her about how things used to be?

SARA	I’ve tried, just gets her upset.

TRAVIS	I’m sorry. That’s none of my business. I just know how healing it was for me to keep my mother’s traditions alive. Especially not being able to get back when she was sick... and then everything happened so quickly. I wasn’t ready.

SARA	I don’t think anybody is. Your whole life changes in an instant.

TRAVIS	That’s true. The way my parents loved each other... I mean, that’s how I pictured Christmas was gonna be with my family.

SARA	I think you’ll be a wonderful father someday. You connect so easily to kids.

TRAVIS	Thank you. And Chloe makes it easy. She’s a great kid.

SARA	She is lighter here. More connected.

TRAVIS	That’s what’s great about life here. Is connecting with people. You know, sitting together, talking. We take the time, and enjoy the journey just as much as the destination.

SARA	And I’m always too busy finding my fastest way to the destination.

TRAVIS	You are working hard to provide a great life for Chloe. And you’re doing a great job.

SARA	There’s nothing more important to me. She needs to know we’re going to be okay.

TRAVIS	She’s lucky to have a mom like you.

J.T.	Teddy turned on me. I’ll be back after the crew and I feed the stock. Let me know if you need anything.

TRAVIS	Will do.

SARA	He’s nice.

TRAVIS	Yeah, he’s like a brother to me. His dad worked here, too, back in the day. A lot of our ranch hands are second, even third generation.

SARA	I can see why Peter’s recommendations weren’t going to work.

TRAVIS	I’m glad you understand.

SARA	I do.

TRAVIS	Oh, must be time to go.

SARA	Where?

TRAVIS	Back to the house. First rule of ranch life... never ignore the chow bell.

TRAVIS	Hey! We heard the bell. What’s cooking?

KAY	Presenting: “Chloe and Lexie’s Secret -- ”

CHLOE/LEXIE	Super-Secret --

KAY	Super-Secret recipe egg nog.

TRAVIS	Here you go.

SARA	Thank you.

TRAVIS	Thank you.

CHLOE	Oh look. I put a cinnamon stick in it like Dad used to.

SARA	You remember that?

CHLOE	I remember everything.

SARA	Oh, excuse me. Here.

TRAVIS	Sure.

KAY	I get some too.

TRAVIS	Fair enough.

SARA	I know, Peter. But it’s different once you see it in person. There are a lot of moving parts to consider.

PETER	Well, if you can’t come up with an alternate solution, you need to help him do what he has to do.

SARA	Did you send me here to try to talk him into laying people off?

PETER	Of course not. I sent you there because we’re trying to help one of our oldest clients hang onto his legacy. You only got three left days, Sara. At some point, you’re going to have to tell them the same thing I did.

SARA	I still have time. Bye.

TRAVIS	Everything okay?

SARA	It will be. I know there is a lot riding on all of this. For everyone.

TRAVIS	Well, we appreciate you trying to find a different way to make the loan happen.

SARA	Yeah, I’m doing my best. It would be a lot easier if I didn’t care so much. About the ranch, and your family, and the traditions. I didn’t expect that.

TRAVIS	I didn’t expect that either. I’ve got an idea.

SARA	What?

TRAVIS	Nothing clears the head like a long ride. And at Christmas, it’s even better. Have you ever been on a horse?

SARA	Does sitting on a pony walking around in a circle when you’re five count?

TRAVIS	No. No, it doesn’t. But don’t worry, we’ll find the right horse for you. It’s always good to match a rider’s personality with a horse. Sara, this is Liberty. Smart as a whip, fiercely loyal... and has a heart of gold.

SARA	Hello.

SARA	Do I really have to wear this thing?

TRAVIS	Yes. Safety first. Now, come on. I’ll leg you up.

SARA	You’ll what me up?

TRAVIS	Ah, you use my hands as stool. I give you a boost, and you throw your leg over the back of the horse. Don’t worry about it. I’ll be right here.

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	It’s okay.

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	All right. Yeah. 

SARA	No. Wait. Okay. Okay.

TRAVIS	Whoa! It’s okay, it’s okay. I’m right here.

SARA	All right.

TRAVIS	You want to try that again?

SARA	Yeah, yeah. I don’t give up so easily.

TRAVIS	Okay.

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	Ready? Perfect! 

SARA	I did it!

TRAVIS	Great job!

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	Great job. Oh, easy.

SARA	Whoa whoa whoa!

TRAVIS	You just squeezed your legs a little. To her, that means “go.” 

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	Now, you just use the reigns. Right, right, left. It’s like driving a car.

SARA	All right. Oh, yeah. I got this.

TRAVIS	Okay.

SARA	I got it.

TRAVIS	You’re doing great.

SARA	This is great.

TRAVIS	You’re a natural.

SARA	Oh, I didn’t say go. I didn’t do the leg thingy.

TRAVIS	Don’t worry. You’re headed in the right direction. I’ve got your back.

SARA	That was amazing.

TRAVIS	It was fun, right?

SARA	Yeah!

TRAVIS	You’re a natural.

SARA	Thank you.

SARA	Thanks, Luke.

CHLOE	Mom, I’ve been taking photos. You know how to ride a horse?

SARA	It was more like “walking”, but... I suppose, yes. Do you want to learn how?

CHLOE	Then we could go riding together someday.

SARA	I would love that.

TRAVIS	Hey Neil! Hey kids! Merry Christmas!

NEIL	Merry Christmas! And thanks again.

TRAVIS	Our pleasure.

TRAVIS	Oh, that’s the Hayes family. They get their tree from us every year.

CHLOE	I'll see you guys at the house.

SARA	See you, sweetie.

TRAVIS	Okay.

SARA	You didn’t mention you were running a Christmas tree lot.

TRAVIS	Well, we aren’t. But I invite people to get their trees from us every year.

SARA	And you don’t charge for that?

TRAVIS	Well no, that would be like me charging you for riding lessons.

SARA	I mean, it’s not a huge income stream, but every little bit helps.

TRAVIS	Well tell you what. If you come out with us to get our tree tonight, I will charge you for the honor.

SARA	You’re joking, but you’re actually onto something.

TRAVIS	Am I?

SARA	So why do you wait so long to cut down your tree?

TRAVIS	Well, my dad couldn’t take any time off work until a couple days before Christmas. So we save up all the decorating until then and I guess it just became a tradition.

SARA	Seems like everything around here becomes a tradition.

TRAVIS	Well, when we find something special, you try to keep it around.

CHLOE	Whoa, it’s beautiful in here.
SARA	I mean, it’s like a snow globe come to life. It’s like what everyone thinks Christmas is supposed to look like.

TRAVIS	Merry Christmas!

SARA	How can you do this every year without losing all your trees?

TRAVIS	Well, we always plant two for every one that someone takes. I mean, that’s what ranching is, it’s cyclical. Everything has a time and a place and everything we do now matters for the future.
POPS	Come on, come on. Less talking, more looking.

TRAVIS	Okay.

SARA	How about that one?

TRAVIS	Enh, it’s a good Charlie Brown Christmas tree.

SARA	Or how about that one?

TRAVIS	We’ll find one for you.

CHLOE	This is the one.

TRAVIS	That’s a great one. You’ve got a good eye.

TRAVIS	Here you go.

SARA	You want me to do it?

TRAVIS	It’s all part of the Christmas in Montana experience. Yeah.

SARA	I suppose it is. Okay.

CHLOE	Come on Mom, let’s do it.

SARA	Okay, just watch out sweetie.

TRAVIS	I’ll get the bottom branches first.

SARA	Okay. Okay, let her go!

TRAVIS	Three, two, one!

SARA	Timber!

TRAVIS	All right, let’s get her home.

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	All right. Nice cut!

CHLOE	You just did that!

SARA	I know. I just did that... Oh, should we help you?

TRAVIS	Sure. Grab an end, let’s go.

SARA	Okay, come on, this is heavier than I thought. Yeah, it totally is.

TRAVIS	You’re doing great!

SARA	Oh my gosh, this is really heavy.

KAY	Yeah, why don’t you put that one right there, I think that’ll look nice.

POPS	Every member of the family going back generations has an ornament with their name on it. And they all go on the tree. Including friends who become family. I have the perfect place for it.

KAY	Thank you.

SARA	It’s a beautiful tradition.

TRAVIS	And now, you’re part of it too.

SARA	Thank you.

TRAVIS	Around here, when people help each other, they become family. We know you’re doing everything you can to help us.

SARA	You’ve helped us too. More than you know.

CHLOE	I wish dad could see this.

SARA	He can.

KAY	Wow, so pretty.

TRAVIS	Here you go.

SARA	Thank you.

TRAVIS	It’s freezing out here. Do you want to go inside?

SARA	I actually like the cold. It helps me think. Who knew?

TRAVIS	I did, of course.

SARA	This place is incredible. I’ve never seen Christmas brought to life like this.

TRAVIS	I’d like to think it’s all about who you experience it with.

SARA	Well, I’m glad it’s with you. And your family, of course.

TRAVIS	Of course.

SARA	Did you pay someone to do that?

TRAVIS	It’s the Ursids meteor shower. It’s peaking tonight. I thought it was going to be cloudy, but it’s clear as can be.

SARA	It’s amazing.

TRAVIS	Do you think Chloe would like to see this?

SARA	I’ll go get her.

TRAVIS	Okay.

SARA	I have never seen a meteor shower before.

TRAVIS	All the city lights get in the way?

SARA	That, and I was never patient enough.

CHLOE	Oh! There’s a big one, right there! Make a wish.

POPS	Hey, thanks for doing the dishes, guys.

SARA	It’s literally the least I could do after such a wonderful day. Awww. Look at her.

POPS	After Kay left, she put her head down and fell asleep in, like, ten seconds.

SARA	I love how tired she is at the end of a day on the ranch. And she’s never seemed happier.

POPS	That’s funny, that’s what she said about you.

SARA	Hey, Chloe. Are you ready to go back to the inn?

CHLOE	No.

SARA	I think she’s down for the count.

TRAVIS	Yeah. So just stay, you can take the extra couch. We’ve got plenty of blankets.

POPS	And in the morning, we can have a big breakfast.

SARA	And then we can-- okay.

TRAVIS	Then we can get to work. Yeah well, beat you to it that time.

TRAVIS	You have everything you need?

SARA	I think so.

TRAVIS	Okay. Well, just in case. It gets cold.

SARA	Thank you.

TRAVIS	Night.

SARA	Good night.

TRAVIS	I was hoping you were going to be here this morning.

KAY	Can’t have breakfast without my famous cinnamon rolls now, can you?

POPS	No, we cannot!

POPS	Okay, let’s dig in.

KAY	Hey!

POPS	What? They’re delicious.

KAY	Well, don’t tell anyone they’re from a can.

POPS	What?!

TRAVIS	No way.

KAY	Okay, they’re homemade. I just didn’t want your dad to overdo it.

POPS	Hey, I’ll skip lunch.

TRAVIS	So, did you sleep okay?

SARA	Better than I have in a long time.

POPS	You know, as long as a Carson owns this ranch, you have an invitation to breakfast anytime.

SARA	I better get back to the B&B soon so I can make sure a Carson does own this ranch. Now, and in the future.

CHLOE	But can we at least stop at the Christmas Market on the way back?

SARA	Yeah, sure.

CHLOE	Thanks for taking me, mom. I wanted to pick up some more yarn for my scarf.

SARA	That’s a lot of yarn.

CHLOE	I really like this color, but it’s cashmere so it’s really expensive.

SARA	I’ve got you.

CHLOE	Actually?

SARA	Mm-hmm.

CHLOE	Thank you!

SARA	Here you go.

SARA	That scarf is going to be beautiful.

CHLOE	Thank you. Do you want me to teach you how to make one? I mean, I know you have to work, so--

SARA	Um, I will. After you teach me to knit.

CHLOE	Okay. So this is the eighth row on my Christmas scarf. And basically, all you have to do is take that and then take it off. Here, you try it. 

SARA	Okay.

CHLOE	Do you want me to help?

SARA	Yes, please.

CHLOE	Okay, so put the needle through the loop. Grab the yarn. 

SARA	Yeah.

CHLOE	Pull it through.

SARA	Yeah.

CHLOE	Find your stitch, slide it off. Yeah! You just did one stitch!

SARA	I’m exhausted.

CHLOE	Mom, this is the best Christmas we’ve had since Dad died.

SARA	I think so too.

CHLOE	Then, do we really have to leave on the 23rd?

SARA	I mean, that’s the deadline. After that, my work is done.

CHLOE	Well ... can’t we just stay for Christmas?


SARA	Sweetie, we can’t invite ourselves to someone else’s Christmas. No matter how much we want to be there. And if my recommendation is the same as Peter’s, I doubt I’ll be welcome anyway.

CHLOE	Right.

SARA	Okay, show me one more time.

CHLOE	Okay.

SARA	So through--

CHLOE	Yep, yep...

SARA	Oh, there it is.

CHLOE	Mm-hmm. And then let go.

SARA	Let go?

CHLOE	Yep, just pull it like that.

SARA	Oh, slide it.

CHLOE	Yeah.

SARA	Ah, you said “let go”.

CHLOE	Okay, well, slide it.

SARA	If I let go, I just drop it.

SARA	Midnight snack?

CHLOE	Kay’s fruitcake. I can’t get enough of this stuff.

SARA	Well, no one can say that you haven’t embraced the Christmas spirit here.

CHLOE	You have, too.

SARA	You know, as a matter of fact, I have.

CHLOE	Where did you get those?

SARA	In the Market. I figured, when in Montana...

CHLOE	I love them. Thank you, Mom.

SARA	Hi, Peter.

PETER	Apologies for the late call. I’m-- I’m just concerned.

SARA	Don’t worry. You’ll have the report first thing tomorrow.

PETER	Actually, I’m more concerned about your methodology.

SARA	What do you mean?

PETER	Well, you know my granddaughter follows your daughter on social media, right?

SARA	Katie? Sure. Yeah, they’re been friendly since the company picnic. I still am not following.


PETER	Well, Katie and I went out to dinner tonight, and she showed me Chloe’s feed. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m glad you’re having fun. But I don’t know what to think when I see pictures of you decorating a Christmas tree, on a horse, or singing Christmas carols by a bonfire...

SARA	I was just doing what you’re always talking about, putting people before profits.

PETER	Well, yes, that is what we try to do. But in the end, the Carson’s are still going to have to prove they can afford this loan. I’m looking at those pictures, and I’m wondering whether they’re running a cattle business or a Christmas business.

SARA	Peter, what is the last possible minute I can send in my report.

PETER	They’ll need time to review it upstairs, Sara. Noon tomorrow. That’s the best I can do.

SARA	That’s all I need.

CHLOE	What happened?

SARA	You know how much it bugs me when you post pictures of absolutely everything we do?

CHLOE	Mm-hmm?

SARA	Your doing that might have just saved this ranch.

CHLOE	What? How?

SARA	I’ll explain later. But right now, you need to get some sleep... and I need to get to work.

SARA	Okay.

KAY	I think you singlehandedly drank all the coffee I had in the entire inn.

SARA	I’m sorry. I just have to keep going. I think I found the solution for the ranch.

KAY	That’s wonderful news!

SARA	Well, I still have to convince Travis and the bank to agree to my proposal.

KAY	May I see? I can’t believe nobody's thought of doing this before.

SARA	Sometimes it takes an outsider to see things from a different angle.

KAY	You’re no outsider now. In fact, I’d say that you’re closer to Travis Carson than anyone since he brought that fiancée back from New York.

SARA	He was engaged?

KAY	Well, only until the young lady realized she wasn’t marrying a lawyer... she was marrying a rancher. He hasn’t been with anyone since.

SARA	Really? I would have thought he was Big Fork’s most eligible bachelor.

KAY	Everyone here knew his heart was closed. Until now.

SARA	I better go wake Chloe up and get over there. I can’t wait to show this to Travis.

POPS	Well, I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this.

TRAVIS	Well, unless Sara has some other recommendations, this is the only answer.

POPS	Are you sure?

TRAVIS	No, and I hate to lose part of our land, but it’s better than losing the people we love.

TRAVIS/SARA	I need to talk to you.

POPS	I’ll leave you two. Sarah.

TRAVIS	Please, let me go first. I’m going to sell two thousand acres.

SARA	What? But that’s ten percent of your property.

TRAVIS	I know. But this way we won’t need the loan at all.

SARA	Maybe not this year, but what about the future? What if there’s another drought?

TRAVIS	Well, this is what have to do now.

SARA	But if you listen to what I have to say, you might never have to.

TRAVIS	Okay, what are you talking about?

SARA	It finally hit me. This was never going to work if we focus on cutting costs. It’s about adding profitability year in and year out, by monetizing everything you’re already doing for Christmas.

TRAVIS	Oh, we already talked about this. That’s not what this ranch is about. I’m not going to charge my family and friends.

SARA	No, you don’t need to. This is about the people who would travel here to find that class, old fashioned Christmas they’re longing for. Just... look at the proposal.

TRAVIS	Okay, all right. 

SARA	Okay? Just let me show it to you.

SARA	So... what do you think?

TRAVIS	Are you sure there’s a market for this? 

SARA	I was up all night doing the research. There are already a few ranches upstate doing this. And look what they charge per week. 

TRAVIS	Wow!

SARA	Now you know why I got so excited about the idea.

TRAVIS	Well, who would run it though? I mean, Pops and I still have to run the ranch.

SARA	Well, you’d hire a manager, and that is all laid out in this budget. I also worked out a loan structure so you could get the initial funding to renovate. Travis, “Christmas at Carson Ranch” is about giving people something they’re missing. That connection to Christmas, to family, to themselves. I know that’s what it did for me and Chloe. And we’ll always be grateful. I’m so glad we came here.

TRAVIS	I am too.

SARA	So... what do you think? Do you want to move forward?

TRAVIS	Definitely.

KAY	Everybody ready?

TRAVIS	For what?

KAY	We still have to decorate the gingerbread houses for the dessert table, of course.

TRAVIS	Yeah, yeah, I’m not sure if it’s the right time--

POPS	It’s the perfect time. I mean, we all need to do something while we’re waiting. Right?

CHLOE	Can Lexie come too?

POPS	Of course! The more the merrier.

SARA	It’ll help the time go faster.

TRAVIS	Okay.

POPS	Hey, let’s get started!

TRAVIS	All right.

SARA	So what do you think?

TRAVIS	Well, it’s gonna be fantastic. I just hope this isn’t the only version of the Christmas Ranch we get to see.

SARA	I’m sure it’s fine.

TRAVIS	It’s the 23rd. I mean, that’s their deadline. Shouldn’t we have heard something by now?

SARA	Well, the underwriters have until end of business today. I suppose, technically, they have as long as they want.

POPS	Wait -- they can extend the deadline?

SARA	I guess if they can’t decide by today, yes.

CHLOE	So we could stay for Christmas? I mean, we can’t leave until we know for sure about the loan, right?

SARA	Chloe, they have their own traditions. We don’t want to impose.

POPS	You think you’d impose? Part of our tradition is having people we care about here with us. Family and friends, old and new... and that’s you.

TRAVIS	It really wouldn’t be the same without you.

SARA	In that case... there’s no place we’d rather be. I guess we’ll postpone our flight.

POPS	Great!

SARA	Hello? Hi. Okay. Okay. Okay, thank you. I’ll tell them.

SARA	“The Carson Christmas Ranch” is officially in business!

POPS	Yes!

TRAVIS	We got the loan?

SARA	You got the loan!

TRAVIS	We got the loan! You did it.

SARA	No. We did it.

TRAVIS	We should celebrate.

SARA	What did you have in mind?

TRAVIS	Well, actually, Stephen is having a little, you know, party at his restaurant. Kind of a “Christmas Eve-Eve” tradition. Maybe... Maybe we should go. Chloe’s welcome too, of course.

TRAVIS	You all are.

SARA	What do you think, Chloe?

CHLOE	Mom, Lexie invited me to go Christmas caroling with her friends from school. Her parents are chaperoning us.

SARA	That sounds like fun.

CHLOE	So it’s okay if I go?

SARA	Of course you can.

POPS	Kay and I could drop Chloe off, and then Kay would be at the B&B to watch her when she came back. Okay? Okay.

TRAVIS	Then that leaves the two of us.

SARA	I guess so.

KAY	Well, I’m so thrilled for you, Travis.

TRAVIS	Yeah, about the Christmas Ranch?

KAY	Yes, but... that’s not what I was talking about.

TRAVIS	By the way, I’m really glad you’ve been coming around more often.

KAY	Oh. Because of all the food that I bring?

TRAVIS	Yes, but that’s not what I’m talking about.

TRAVIS	You look beautiful.

SARA	You look great too.

TRAVIS	Thank you.

SARA	But I thought you’d be wearing a bolo tie.

TRAVIS	A bolo? No, I only wear those on days that end in “never.”

SARA	Big Fork really knows how to celebrate Christmas.

TRAVIS	That’s how we do things around here. Go big or go home.


SARA	I don’t know how anyone leaves this place.

TRAVIS	Oh, they do. But if they have any Montana in their soul, they always find their way back.

SARA	Like you did from New York?

TRAVIS	Yeah. Yeah, I didn’t realize how good I had it until I left.

SARA	Well, sometimes you don’t know where you belong until you get there. And then it all becomes so clear.

TRAVIS	Exactly.

STEPHEN	Real glad to see you two. Order whatever you like, it’s on the house.

TRAVIS	Thank you.

TRAVIS	Oh, it helps to be good friends with the chef.

SARA	Roasted tofu with quinoa, peaches and fennel. Wow.

TRAVIS	Is that a good “wow?” Or like, “Wow.”

SARA	It’s a great “wow.” Thank you for doing that for me.

TRAVIS	Well, you jumped into the Montana life with both feet. I figured the least I could do is try a little bit of “California.” What?

SARA	If you had asked me a month ago where I would be on Christmas Eve-Eve, my answer definitely wouldn’t have been “having a candlelight vegetarian dinner with a cattle rancher from Big Fork, Montana.”

TRAVIS	Really? Cause that’s what my answer would have been.


TRAVIS	That was really good. Yeah, I thought I was going to have to sneak a second supper on the way home. Would you like to dance?

SARA	I would love to.

TRAVIS	Okay.

TRAVIS	Did you want to go for a stroll?

SARA	I’d love to.

TRAVIS	Okay, you know the “stroll” means “walking slowly,” right?

SARA	I’ll do my best. I think this is the first time we’ve ever walked at the same pace.

TRAVIS	Yeah, congratulations. I think you’re finally on Montana Time. Have I thanked you already for saving our ranch?

SARA	Yes. Numerous times.

TRAVIS	Good. Have I thanked you for reminding me what it feels like to fall head over heels for someone?

SARA	No. I feel the same way.

TRAVIS	But...?

SARA	Maybe that’s why we shouldn’t stay.

TRAVIS	Why not?

SARA	I mean, we have to leave right after Christmas. And then what happens? How does this work?

TRAVIS	I don’t know, I don’t, but we’ll figure it out.

SARA	No, Travis. This is your life, this is your home. I have a daughter at school in Los Angeles. I have a job, I have security. I cannot give that up. I’m sorry.

TRAVIS	I understand.

SARA	I better get back to Chloe...

CHLOE	I don’t want to leave. We should be going to Christmas Eve dinner tonight, not the airport.


SARA	Chloe, I know you’re upset, but if we stay, it would just make things harder.

CHLOE	It’s already hard! Everything was better here, Mom. We were better. You know it, and I know it. This is how Christmas used to be. We never talk about Dad at Christmas. We barely talk about anything. Not until we got here.

SARA	I know. And... that’s my fault. I guess I thought I was protecting you. I was just trying to keep you from any more pain.

CHLOE	I was doing the same thing.

SARA	That’s the best thing about this place, wasn’t it? People slow down, they talk, they share...

CHLOE	Like right now.

SARA	Just like right now.

CHLOE	I still miss Dad.

SARA	I know. So do I. I have something for you. I was going to wait until Christmas, but I want you to have it now. It’s for the Christmas charm bracelet Daddy gave you when you were little. I know you don’t have it here, but I thought maybe you’d want to wear it again someday.


CHLOE	I have it. I always have it. I just didn’t want to wear it again... Not until right now. Thank you so much, Mom. Merry Christmas.

SARA	Merry Christmas, sweetie. I love you.

CHLOE	I love you, too.

TRAVIS	I know what you’re going to say.

POPS	And what’s that?

TRAVIS	That I shouldn’t have let her go. That I was just too scare to ask her to stay. That I was worried that it was going to turn out the same way it did with Elizabeth. And that I made the biggest mistake of my life.

POPS	Yep. Pretty much. Thanks for saving me the trouble.

TRAVIS	She has a career, Dad. She has a life in California. How’s that gonna work?

POPS	You make her know it in her heart, that it’s worth at least trying. And then you find a way, even if it means moving heaven and earth to do it.

TRAVIS	Well, it’s too late now.

POPS	Maybe not. Kay just told me they’re still at the B&B.

TRAVIS	For how long?

POPS	At least another fifteen minutes.

TRAVIS	What if she doesn’t want to stay?

POPS	What if she does?

TRAVIS	Can you handle things here, if I go?

POPS	Of course I can. And I’ll have Kay to help me.

TRAVIS	Dad. About Kay --

POPS	I know what you’re going to say.

TRAVIS	All I’m going to say is if I’m putting it out there, you should too.

POPS	Deal.

KAY	Chloe, honey, let’s go upstairs and make sure you didn’t forget anything.

SARA	Oh, but just for a minute. The cab’s almost here.

CHLOE	Okay.

SARA	Hi.

TRAVIS	Hi.

SARA	Is there something wrong with the paperwork for the loan?

TRAVIS	No. No, nothing’s wrong with the paperwork.

SARA	Okay.

TRAVIS	But there’s everything wrong with you leaving.

SARA	Travis, we talked about this. The longer we stay, the harder it will be to leave. And I know if I spend just one Christmas with you, I will never want to leave again.


TRAVIS	Then stay. For this Christmas and every Christmas after that.
SARA	There’s too much to lose. I have to protect Chloe.

TRAVIS	Well, you said she’s never been happier. And that you and she have never been closer.

SARA	It’s true.

TRAVIS	So... isn’t that what she needs? Isn’t that what everyone needs? Anyway, you can’t leave. Around here, we finish what we’ve started.

SARA	What do you mean?

TRAVIS	Obviously, I’m going to need your help finding someone to run the Christmas Ranch.

SARA	That could take some time.

TRAVIS	I have a candidate in mind. In fact, I can’t imagine anyone running it but her. I just have to convince her to take a leap of faith.

SARA	You just did. I really don’t want to leave.

TRAVIS	I really can’t imagine doing this without you.

CHLOE	What’s going on?

SARA	We were wondering if you’d like to stay through Christmas.

TRAVIS	Is that a “yes”?

SARA	I think that’s a yes, from both of us.

CHLOE	I’m going to go tell Lexie!

SARA	I can’t stop thinking about how close we came to missing all this.

TRAVIS	Well, you don’t have to. You’re here now. You’re home.

SARA	Does it get any more perfect than this?

TRAVIS	Actually, yes.

TRAVIS	Merry Christmas, Dad.

POPS	Merry Christmas, Son.

KAY	You made it!

POPS	Merry Christmas, Sara.

POPS	Merry Christmas. Come on.
