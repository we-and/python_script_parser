WOMAN	Previously on "The Quad."

EVA	Were you just flirting with my daughter?

SERENA	Did you get a second opinion?

CECIL	Lung cancer.

EVA	What happened to her, Danny?

DANNY	Complicated choreography, ma'am.

CEDRIC	And I hear y'all got faith in that wack-ass ruby dude. Oops, I meant diamond dude.

NONI	One of them said if a dude was willing to put an instrument in his mouth, no telling what else he'll put in it.

DANNY	That's big talk from a man about to lose his spot to Casper the friendly quarterback.

MADISON	Syd, please tell me what's wrong.

SYDNEY	That's me.

TIESHA	I heard he threw the mic at Dr. Fletcher and jumped off the stage.

KIARA	There was no stage, silly woman.

HILLARE	Were you there? No.

KIARA	Okay, well, a brother who was at the party posted a video on Twitter.

BRYCE	Oh, I saw.

BARBER	Okay, so maybe the mic wasn't thrown, but I heard it definitely was tossed.

BRYCE	I'm telling you, man, I was there.

BARBER	So was Dr. Fletcher mad?

BRYCEA	 little bit. She was a little mad.

HILLARE	Cedric is crazy, and he's cute, am I right?

ALL	Yeah.

NAIL TECH	Y'all see that other video?

RACHEL	Oh my God, yes.

BARBER	I'm gonna tell you, ole boy was really getting some in those bushes. Nothing like that ever happens to me. Like, never.

BRYCE	So y'all don't think that was rape?

KIARA	You ask me, it looked like two people having sex who just happened to get caught on tape.

ALL	Mm-hmm.

TIESHA	Are you freakin' kidding me? It's clear as day she was raped.

KIARA	Not to me.

CEDRIC	I don't know about all that. I did notice she wasn't moving, though. Like she was hurt. Maybe somebody y'all know, maybe even cool with.

DR. GARNETT	All right, well, here's what we're assuming, folks. The object is moving in a straight line, right? And the rate of change of velocity is constant. All of the following are equivalent notations for dx equals a. The derivative evaluated at x equals a. But if you want to pass this class, remember these are the basics. You have to understand this material. Velocity is a vector quantity. As such, velocity is direction aware. Miss Fletcher? Miss Fletcher? Is everything okay?

SYDNEY	I'm fine.

CHIEF GAINES	Dr. Fletcher? EJ here is the one who came across the information you asked about.

EVA	You work with campus security, EJ?

EJ	Yes, ma'am. Computer and camera maintenance. I'm a computer science major, so.

EVA	Is this system wireless?

EJ	No, ma'am. All co-ax in underground conduit.

EVA	If it's hard-wired and the signal is secure, how did someone obtain the video?

EJ	Actually, it's not that difficult. Even if the system is hard-wired, you can still get into it by intercepting a password handshake, and then

CHIEF GAINES	I don't see what difference it makes. Someone got into the system. We've got an easy breach that needs to be patched up.

EVA	Did you cut and leak this video, EJ?

CHIEF GAINES	Well, of course he didn't. He

EJ	Yes, ma'am, I did.

EVA	Why would you do that?

EJ	I shouldn't have. As soon as I pressed upload, I wanted to take it back.

CHIEF GAINES	Dr. Fletcher, it's done. It's no big deal. I'll take care of it.

EVA	I asked you a question, EJ.

EJ	I'm just tired of it. Not just this school but everywhere. My cousin goes to a private school in Oregon.

CHIEF GAINES	EJ.

EJA	 dude dropped something in her drink, took advantage of her, and nothing happened. And nothing ever happens here, either.

EVA	I am very sorry to hear about your cousin, EJ. And you think this kind of thing occurs on our campus, too?

EJ	I know it does.

EVA	Hmm. Thank you for your honesty. You can go now.

EJ	Please accept my apology.

EVA	I do.

CHIEF GAINES	He's a kid. I wouldn't be too hard on him.

EVA	And what about his supervisor? Should I be hard on him?

CHIEF GAINES	You wanted information on the video and I gave it to you.

EVA	You still don't see the problem.

CHIEF GAINES	Three, four times a week those cameras catch students hooking up in every corner of this campus. And that's all they are, hookups. And that's all that video is. Two kids who had too much to drink who got caught on tape doing what they do.

EVA	That's all it is, huh? What if it's more? What if that young woman was raped? Now, given that it's at least a possibility, she deserves our due diligence.

CHIEF GAINES	Okay, so what do you want me to do?

EVA	I want you to offer your letter of resignation.


CHIEF GAINES	Why? For what reason?

EVA	HR can help you with that.

DANNY	Good afternoon, sir.

CECIL	Good afternoon. This won't take long. Y'all are aware of this video, the rape video, they're calling it?

STUDENTS	Yes, sir.

CECIL	Any of you have personal knowledge of it?

KIARA	No.

DANNY	I met with every band member individually. It's not us. We don't know who they are.

CECIL	That's a good thing. Because we are separate and apart from nonsense like that. And if I ever hear of any one of you, male or female, sexually assaulting another student, you will be dismissed immediately.

DANNY	With all due respect, sir, just because they're calling it "the rape video," it doesn't mean she was raped. It looks like two people hooking up in the bushes to me. I wouldn't do it, but obviously some people would.

CECIL	Well, this is not gonna turn into an "Express Yourself" session, drum major. Here's what you need to leave here with. We are above such behavior. We are above gossiping about who may have been involved in such behavior. Am I clear?

KIARA	Yeah.

DANNY	Yes, sir.

CECIL	Good. You're dismissed.

KIARA	Hey, I've got to tell you something.

DANNY	You know who's in that video?

KIARA	Better. Guess who told Terrence you were talking shit about him right before he sucker-punched you?

DANNY	Who?

KIARA	Mr. Diamond's fake-ass protege. My roommate's boyfriend's on the football team. She told me everything.

DANNY	Noni.

KIARA	Mm-hmm.

DANNY	Little bitch set me up.

EBONIE	Hey, Ced.

CEDRIC	Yo. What up, Eb? About time your goofy ass picked up the phone. How come you been duckin' me?

EBONIE	I ain't been ducking you, Ced. I just been busy going to all these appointments.

CEDRIC	You stay up in the doctor's office.

EBONIE	Who you tellin'?

CEDRIC	So, what the white coats say? You good?

EBONIE	Scans are clear.

CEDRIC	What about those headaches?

EBONIE	Haven't had one in a couple of weeks.

CEDRIC	Yo, Eb, that's good. Yo, yo, yo. We should go out. Let's celebrate.

EBONIE	I don't want to go anywhere.

CEDRIC	All right.

EBONIE	Look, let me call you later. Time for my head meds.

CEDRIC	You good?

EBONIE	I'm good.

JILL	How does it feel to so soundly beat the team that treated you so roughly in your first start last year?

TERRENCE	Every win okay, it's a little sweet.

JILL	You rushed for over 100 yards, two touchdowns in three quarters. Did you have any inkling this would be such a special year?

TERRENCE	Not really. But I kept believing in myself and my team, and now we're doing it. I feel really blessed.

JILL	And with good reason. Were you surprised to see your backup quarterback score two more touchdowns in mop-up duty?

TERRENCE	Like I said, I feel really blessed.

JILL	Folsom, you looked great out there. Two passing touchdowns, and our guy in the booth called them NFL throws. You've been out of football two years. How vindicated do you feel right now?

BOJOHN	I'm just glad to do my part to get a win.

PLAYER	Undefeated!

JILL	You are still undefeated. Are the Mountain Cats a team of destiny?

COACH HARDWICK	I don't know. You tell me.

JILL	Congratulations on the win.

COACH HARDWICK	Thank you. Thank you very much. Great job, coach.

EBONIE	Ma, I told you, I'm not hungry.

CEDRIC	Damn.

EBONIE	Cedric?

CEDRIC	It's like Afghanistan in here, girl.

EBONIE	Oh my God. What are you what are you doing here?

CEDRIC	I told you. We need to celebrate.

EBONIE	And I told you, I'm not going anywhere.

CEDRIC	Well, look around, Eb. You need to get out of here. I get it. The band thing went sideways on you. But

EBONIE	Sideways? Playing in Diamond's band was all I ever wanted to do since I was a kid. And I had it. I was there. You don't know what it's like to have something you love so much just taken from you.

CEDRIC	Seriously?

EBONIE	I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. I've been wrapped up. How are you, Ced?

CEDRIC	I don't know. If you'd ask me that question five times a day, and I'd have five different answers for you.

EBONIE	They know who did it?

CEDRIC	Nah.

EBONIE	I'm sorry. That's that's crazy.

CEDRIC	That's why if I can leave the house

EBONIE	Fine. For you, I'll go.

BOJOHN	Hey, coach?

COACH HARDWICK	BoJohn Folsom, hey. What's up?

BOJOHN	You got a minute?

COACH HARDWICK	Ah, just about a minute. Meeting with the coaching staff.

BOJOHN	Okay. Um, can I sit?

COACH HARDWICK	Yeah, yeah. Have a seat. What's on your mind?

BOJOHN	You know I'm grateful you took a chance on me, right?

COACH HARDWICK	Right.

BOJOHN	I'm playing ball, getting an education. I'm just, you know hoping I haven't disappointed you in any way.

COACH HARDWICK	Let me help you out. Now, I can't put you in right now with Terrence giving us wins. Now, I see you getting more play time, though. And remember, he graduates next year, so a little patience and the starting spot is yours. If you want it bad enough.

BOJOHN	All right, then, Coach. I plan to show you how bad I want it. Get ready.

COACH HARDWICK	Hey, I'm ready. The question is, are you ready?

BOJOHN	I'm ready.

MADISON	Hey.

SYDNEY	Hey. I am happy to report, I cleaned up at Nordstrom's half-yearly sale. Picked up a little something for you, too. What? You look like you just lost your best friend.

MADISON	I didn't lose my best friend, but I am worried about her. Sit. You are dealing with a lot.

SYDNEY	All I'm dealing with right now is finding a space in this tiny closet for my new Loubous.

MADISON	Sydney. I'm serious. I'm worried about you. You need to talk to someone.

SYDNEY	I am talking to someone. To you, right now. But I won't be for long if you keep stressing me.

MADISON	At least tell your mom.

SYDNEY	Are you kidding me right now? And watch her make this about her disappointment and humiliation? Let's talk about what's really important. Your wardrobe.

MADISON	I have told you before, I'm not your project. I am fine with me just the way I am. I've got to get to class. I'd do anything for you, Syd. I hope you know that.

CARLTON	How could you fire the chief without consulting anybody?

EVA	The sign on the door says President, Carlton.

CARLTON	Doesn't say dictator. Things just aren't done that way here.

ELLA	Typically we would meet with the student safety committee about this kind of thing. I I don't know what to say now.

CARLTON	Well, it's too late to say anything now. The man's been chief for nine years and he's gone, just like that.

EVA	The man treated a rape video with the significance of a Groundhog Day report.

CARLTON	We don't know what's going on in that video. It could've been a prank. Or, how that girl liked it.

EVA	How would you like to be sexually assaulted? To be tossed in some bushes and left there with your pants around your ankles?

CARLTON	Now you're being

ELLA	Maybe this is a misunderstanding. I spoke to Chief Gaines, and he's just sick about you even thinking that he would dismiss crime on this campus.

CARLTON	And he could very well sue us for firing him.

EVA	Let him. He fell asleep at the wheel. We're not going to reward him for that.

ELLA	How about this? Let's pause, take a deep breath, grab a cup of coffee and meet back together, 30 minutes?

EVA	Good idea.

MEN	Yeah, life straight up outta movie scene. Lot of cash, lot of girls, other groovy things. Lot of things in this world I would like to see. Lot of things in my life I would like to be.

EBONIE	How you find this spot?


CEDRIC	I I don't sleep much.

EBONIE	That sucks.

CEDRIC	Gives me plenty of time to study. I just like thinking. And thinking about thinking, you know?

EBONIE	That's 'cause you're a poet, flow genius.

CEDRIC	Nah, it's because I'm black. Folks risked lives and broke their backs so the ones who came after would have opportunity. Us, here, we're the ones who came after.

EBONIE	Georgia A&M getting to you.

CEDRIC	Needs to get to you too.

EBONIE	Nah.

CEDRIC	I'm serious, Eb. You should come back.

EBONIE	Ain't nothing but pain for me there.

CEDRIC	You know I understand that. For me, Atlanta will always be the city that took Chantel. But my moms said if I run from this, I'll be running from one thing or another for the rest of my life.

EBONIE	I don't know. My father keeps wanting me to pick up my sax, but honestly, I just don't care about it anymore.

CEDRIC	I can't really say I don't care about the rap game no more, but I need something different. You know, I got to feel like I'm rapping about something more than just growing up in the hood, broke, trying not to get shot.

EBONIE	Yeah, I mean, but if that's your truth, then that's your truth.

CEDRIC	Trump is in the White House. That's our truth.

EBONIE	Mm-hmm.

CEDRIC	What are we gonna do about that? What does the revolution look like now?

EBONIE	That's a good question.

CEDRIC	You feel me? You feel me?

EBONIE	Mm-hmm. That's crazy.

CEDRIC	We've got to make things happen.

EBONIE	My brother.

MEN	Yeah, don't believe that. [inaudible] Check karaoke, baby!

THE BELLA	All right, all right. Everybody know time it is right now, right?

ALL	Time to open up that mic!

THE BELLA	All right, whatever you got. A song, a poem, you want to rap, whatever it is, bring it to the stage. It's gonna be all right.

EBONIE	Hmm. Go on, on up there, flow genius.

CEDRIC	You the one that claims she used to rap.

THE BELLA	All right, now, who got next? You?

EBONIE	Claimed? Boy, please. I was sweet on the mic.

THE BELLA	Who got next?

CEDRIC	Oh, word?

THE BELLA	Come on, I need somebody.

CEDRIC	Hey, I think she got next.

EBONIE	What? No. No, no she don't.

THE BELLA	Come on up here, pretty.

EBONIE	What the


CEDRIC	Come on. Come on.

EBONIE	I hate you. Like, for real. Like, in my heart.

THE BELLA	All right, now, what you gonna do?

EBONIE	I'm gonna battle.

THE BELLA	Okay. Who are you gonna battle?

EBONIE	Let's see. That clown. Come on. What's the matter? You scared? What you scared of, flow genius? Come on, help me out, y'all.

ALL	What you scared of, flow genius? What you scared of, flow genius?

CEDRIC	All right, all right, all right. I'm about to hurt you something bad.

EBONIE	Okay.

CEDRIC	Hey, DJ, drop something.

EBONIE	Now, does a black life matter only when it's lost to a cop? 'Cause I know some bustas that [inaudible] trying to take me out. It wasn't no marching protest, knee kneeling or pumped fist, but it's gonna be some brass breakin' their head, but the wrong [inaudible]. Flow genius, so genius, I see you grinding. Don't let the eight kill your dreams. You put your time in. Stay tweeting, no beefing, [inaudible] the mic, 'cause when you add up all the wrong, you're bound to get it right. And understand that dream chasing is a mental bluff. Sometimes you gotta trade love for a pair of cuffs. And like that [inaudible], it ain't easy, never said it was. But true measure of a man is when you don't give up. Now we can cry, pity party, dwell on the past, or let this anger fuel our future? No looking back. No matter where, no matter when, no matter how we're making. If we keep grinding, keep shining, man, we're destined for greatness. Again. Again. Again.

CEDRIC	Okay. Uh-huh. Again. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Again. Uh, yeah, yeah, uh.

EBONIE	Again.

CEDRIC	That was nice, but that there sounds like it's written. Me, I'm off the top of the dome with the visions of Trump's toupee, my grind like Lupe, always rock a hoodie in the hood like I'm Luke Cage. Why you call me to the stage, any beat I blaze. You my day one like Lunchables in first grade. Don't kay, keep your spirits up, you're a soldier. I got the mic, so keep your focus, [inaudible]. Oh, Lord, I know you get it. I've been gifted, I had to sit back and fix it. I've got a plan for the sister. Just got to open your mind and pay attention. I've got 99 problems and rap ain't one. I should get a gold medal when the battle is done. They're ready for a revolution, but it's already won. My flow is hot as the sun, I use my words like a gun, blam!

EBONIE	Whoa, man say it on a track.

CEDRIC	Hey, you ain't know we like that, hey, hey.

EVA	This damn job never gets easier.

ELLA	But you're hanging in there. You got the water back on.

EVA	To running water.

ELLA	You got strong anti-hazing rules enacted.

EVA	Oh, to kicking Cecil Diamond's ass.

ELLA	For the children.

EVA	Oh, yeah, for the children.

ELLA	Hallelujah. Here's the thing, Madam President. These men are still not ready for you.

EVA	Oh, God, here we go again.

ELLA	And again, and again, and again, 'till you get it in your thick skull. As crazy as it sounds, you are no more than a Yankee to us.

EVA	Us?

ELLA	Yes. Us. And a woman at that.

EVA	Are you saying that I need to be more ladylike, start having the donors over for sweet tea?

ELLA	And what do you have against sweet tea?

EVA	It's just not my preference.

ELLA	Well, everything's not about you. Even with this video or whatever it is, somehow you've made that about you.

EVA	That's ridiculous. How?

ELLA	You talk to everybody like everything they do is wrong, like you're smarter than they are. And it sounds like, "You hicks don't know a damn thing."

EVA	Are you saying I do this to you?

ELLA	Sometimes.

EVA	Ella?

ELLA	Try to be more measured. Think less about being a woman that's trying to prove herself, and more like a president who already has.

EVA	I don't I don't even know what that means.

ELLA	It means you don't have to say everything you feel every time you feel it. Take your time. See how things fall if you don't leap.

EVA	Got it. I'm sorry if you felt like I didn't appreciate you, because I really do.

ELLA	Good. 'Cause I appreciate your wine collection.

EVA	When it really hits the fan, I'll introduce you to the whiskey.

ELLA	Ooh.

MADISON	Hey, Sydney. This is Trina and Lisa.

GIRLS	Hi.


MADISON	They're with IDC.

SYDNEY	What's IDC?

TRINA	I Didn't Consent. We're a sexual assault support group.

SYDNEY	Oh. I've seen you in the quad passing out flyers. Why are they here?

MADISON	To help.

TRINA	Sydney, you can do whatever you want to do. We support your decision, period.

LISA	But if the asshole who raped you isn't outed, he'll do it to someone else.

TRINA	If he hasn't already.

SYDNEY	Get out.

MADISON	Sydney, please.

TRINA	It's okay, Madison. Sydney, we're here if you need us.

SYDNEY	I don't need you. Goodbye. What the hell is wrong with you?

MADISON	Look, I'm sorry

SYDNEY	You should be. I need some space.

MADISON	Well, then, it's a good thing there are two sides to this room.

BOJOHN	Hi, Dad.

BEN	How are you, son?

BOJOHN	I'm good. Just have a test tomorrow.

BEN	Well, I won't keep you. Just wanted you to know I went fishing on your behalf, and son of a bitch, I got some bites.

BOJOHN	What kind of bites?

BEN	I've been emailing some clips from your fourth-quarter performance in this last game to some of the coaches that recruited you in high school. Three of them called. Called. Son, if you transfer before the end of the season, you can play next year.

BOJOHN	I'll think about it, Dad. But it doesn't feel right. Coach Hardwick took me when nobody else would, and

BEN	Feel right nothing. A Division 1 school wants you bad enough, they'll find something for me with medical benefits for me and your mama. They'll get you ready for the NFL. Son, you've got to remember what this is all about, do you hear me? Boy?

BOJOHN	I hear you, Dad.

BEN	All right, then. Well, good luck with your test.

SERENA	I thought you'd never get here.

CECIL	I don't know what else to do.

SERENA	Undress.

CECIL	Talking about my sister. I'm trying my damnedest to make things right with that girl. She's so damn stubborn.

SERENA	Hmm. I guess it runs in the family.

CECIL	I blame my father. Son of a bitch was half mule.

SERENA	Well, it sounds to me like your father isn't the only one that you blame.

CECIL	I left when I should've stayed. Silent, and I should've shouted.

SERENA	Tell her that.

CECIL	I tried to.

SERENA	Well, write her a letter.

CECIL	Don't nobody write letters no more.

SERENA	You write me letters. And we both know that you don't give up until you've done all you can do. Hmm?

CECIL	What I'm gonna do, woman, is you.

EBONIE	That's crazy. But the hook, I don't know. It's missing something. Actually, it might be too long.

CEDRIC	Now you a producer, too, huh?

EBONIE	Whatever.

CEDRIC	Damn, it's late. I should get you back.

EBONIE	I've been cooped up in the house ever since I got out the hospital. With my mom and dad trying to take my temperature every time I cough. You think I could kick it here tonight? I could really use a night away.

CEDRIC	No doubt. Stay as long as you want.

EBONIE	Thanks, Ced.

BRYCE	My bad. I didn't know you had Ebonie?

EBONIE	What's up, blue blood?

BRYCE	Oh, it's really good to see you. You look good, too.

EBONIE	Well, for a girl who had a brain injury.

BRYCE	I didn't mean it like that.

EBONIE	Uh-huh.


CEDRIC	Hey, G, she gonna stay a couple days.

EBONIE	But if it's not okay, I can

BRYCE	I didn't say that. But, um

CEDRIC	But what? She'll take the bed. I'll take the floor. It's done.

EBONIE	I'm gonna I'm gonna step out.

BRYCE	Now you're inviting girls to stay in our room without checking with me? If she gets caught in here, we can get kicked out of the dorms.	

CEDRIC	Nothing's gonna happen to you. You're good, trust me.

BRYCE	Dude, what is your problem?

CEDRIC	You really don't know?

BRYCE	Know what?

CEDRIC	Your pops never told you what went down between him and me?

BRYCE	You mean when he helped you?

CEDRIC	Helped me?

BRYCE	How do you think you got out of jail?

CEDRIC	I got out of jail 'cause I was innocent. Yeah, your pops came to see me. But he came to tell me to my face that I wasn't shit, and that I was never gonna be shit.

BRYCE	Ced, we both know that's a lie.

CEDRIC	I guess he didn't tell me to stay away from his son, either. Fourth generation Richardson. 

NONI	Ebonie? Hi.

EBONIE	Hi. You took my spot?

NONI	Technically it wasn't your spot once you left.

EBONIE	That's really your answer?

NONI	I'm just saying it's not like that.

EBONIE	What's it like then, roomie? I told you everything that Danny and his goons did to me. Everything. And you joined that band anyway? You know, you said you'd do anything to play in Diamond's band. And you did. You crawled all the way up his ass. And I hope you rot there.

CECIL	Hey.

CYNTHIA	You might as well save yourself the postage and the time and stop sending me these. Did you even notice? I never cashed them. Or did you think doubling the amount would change something?

CECIL	Things got to get right between us.

CYNTHIA	You left, Cecil. You got away from the black eyes and the busted lips. You got away and you stayed away. So stay away now.

CECIL	I should've been stronger. I wish God, I wish that you

CYNTHIA	Well, I don't. I stopped wishing a long time ago. We were both fine until you had your crisis of confidence, and we'll be fine when you're done. I'm just asking that you leave me alone. That's all.

CECIL	Cynthia. Cynthia!

EVA	Some days I'd like to be more measured.

MADISON	You might want to see this.

EVA	Behave more like a successful president, and less like a woman who pushes too hard. Today isn't that day. We've all seen the video. I cannot un-see it. Nor can I pretend to never have seen it. A young woman has been assaulted. I wish I wasn't posting my first blog to our website about such a serious matter, but I have to speak on this. Other universities can under-count their sexual assaults, close their eyes to rape culture. But at Georgia A&M, that is not going to happen. We are going to investigate this video, as we will investigate each and every incident of its kind, whether reported or not, because we recognize that reporting such an injury can be an injury in itself. Because we resolve to be guided by what is just and decent. Thank you for joining me on this journey. 

ELLA	Why did we even bother discussing this if you were gonna do whatever you wanted to do anyway?

EVA	Discussing this with you helped me decide what I needed to do. Ella Grace, you're my friend. But I have to do what I think is right. Last thing I wanted to do was disappoint you.

ELLA	It's not what you're doing. It's how you're doing it. I put my academic reputation on the line to help you get this job. I have bent over backwards to help you keep it. And for what?

EVA	To help make this school what we both know it could be.

ELLA	This isn't about both of us. This is about you, Eva. You just can't help yourself. It's a wonder this school survived before you got here. And how will we ever make it after you're gone?

SYDNEY	I'm going to tell her.

MADISON	Let's go tell her now.

SYDNEY	Like, right now?

MADISON	Yeah.

SYDNEY	I'm nervous.

MADISON	I'll be right there with you. What's wrong?

SYDNEY	That's him. That's him.

MADISON	The football player?

DELTAS	He reps that GAMMM U, he reps that GAMMM U, he reps that GAMMM U, he reps that GAMMM U, he reps that GAMMM U.

MADISON	Sydney!

SYDNEY	You raped me! You raped me!

STUDENT	What?

SYDNEY	You raped me!

TERRENCE	No I didn't. What are you talking about?

SYDNEY	Yes, you did! Yes, you did!

TERRENCE	You're crazy.

MADISON	Help me get her away from here.

SYDNEY	You bastard, you raped me! You know you did! You know you did! You know you did! You know you raped me!

TERRENCE	She crazy. No, she crazy.

STUDENT	You all right, man?

TERRENCE	I'm good. I'm good.

EJ	Dr. Fletcher, here are the printouts you asked for.

EVA	Good afternoon.

EJ	Ma'am.

EVA	Thank you. [CRIES]

TERRENCE	Coach? Coach Hardwick?

SYDNEY	Mom? [CRIES]

EVA	I know. I know. Let's go. 

WOMAN	Next time, on "The Quad."

TRINA	Was it stupid for her to be too drunk to take care of herself? Yes. But bad judgment doesn't make rape okay.

TERRENCE	I did not rape her.

WOMAN	One more thing. Would you have a comment if I knew why you tried to choke the life out of your

BOJOHN	Get your hands off of me!

WOMAN	Why'd you get so mad?

EVA	I want that kid out of here.

WOMAN	You can't expel Terrence Berry based on an accusation.

EVA	Bastard raped my child. Terrence and his rights can go to hell. And if you keep him on your football team, you can go to hell too.
