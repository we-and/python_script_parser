KYLE	Hey, man. 

MAN	How you doing?
 
KYLE	Good.

GIRL	Hey, Kyle.

MAN TO KYLE	What's up, boy?
 
BARMAID	Hey, Kyle. Tequila shot?

GIRL	Kyle, how you doing?

KYLE	Who goes to a party to listen to their own music?

AMY	Sorry?
 
KYLE	I said who comes to a party to listen to their own music?

AMY	I think my music is better.

KYLE	You know, you... you keep knocking back the vodka like that, 

KYLE	you won't be able to hear a thing.

AMY	Trust me, I can't get wasted enough tonight. (WASTED: DRUNK)

KYLE	Why don't I help you along with that?

AMY	So this is my last weekend of freedom for like three months.
 
KYLE	Really?
 
KYLE	Why's that?
 
AMY	My mother is punishing me.
 
KYLE	For what?
 
AMY	For stabbing my stepfather.
 
KYLE	Yeah, right.

KYLE	What the fuck?
 
AMY	You're way too easy. 
 
KYLE	Who says that? You're fucking crazy.
 
AMY	Sorry to disappoint, but I'm actually pretty sane.
 
AMY	Unlike my mother who went and married the first random stranger she met
 
AMY	after my father passed away and put him in charge. 

AMY	Anyway...

AMY	I'm Amy, by the way.
KYLE	Amy. Well, I'm Kyle.

KYLE	Kyle Hartmann.

KYLE	Wanna get outof here? 

AMY	Sure.

KYLE	Hold on!

MARCOS	Hey.

HARTMANN	Where are you?
 
MARCOS	About to head to Nassau juvie. 

MARCOS	Don't worry, I've taken care of everything.

MARCOS	Cost you a hundred grand, but the DUI never happened. 

HARTMANN	What about the girl?

MARCOS	Blood test says she was higher than Everest. 

MARCOS	Parents don't want the publicity any more than we do.
 
MARCOS	She'll be fine. Bruised but not broken.

HARTMANN	Never have kids, Marcos.
 
HARTMANN	Listen, the SEC meeting's been pushed till noon. 

HARTMANN	They wanna go over the merger details one more time.
 
MARCOS	Let 'em.

MARCOS	They won't find anything they didn't find the last four times.
 
MARCOS	Don't worry, it'll be approved.
 
MARCOS	All you need to do is close the finance with Westcom. 

HARTMANN	I appreciate you taking care of this.
 
MARCOS	Hey, that's what you pay me for.

MARCOS	You focus on closing that deal. I got Kyle under control.
 
KYLE	What took you so long?

MARCOS	We thought you needed a time-out.
 
KYLE	Seven fucking days? Have you seen the people in this place?

KYLE	Do you know what could have happened to me in there?

MARCOS	You're lucky I know the judge or we would have had plenty of time
 
MARCOS	to see how that played out.
 
KYLE	Where's my dad?

MARCOS	Up to here. 

KYLE	It was an accident, all right? Jesus. A dog ran out.

MARCOS	Your blood alcohol says you saw three dogs and a pink elephant.

KYLE	Where's my phone?

MARCOS	You don't need it where you're going.

KYLE	What's that supposed to mean?

MARCOS	It means your father is sick and tired of cleaning up after you.

MARCOS	He's given you one last chance.

MARCOS	You screw this up, he is cutting you off forever, legally disowning you.

KYLE	That's bullshit. 

MARCOS	I got the papers all drawn up. You wanna see?
 
MARCOS	Hey. You want him?
 
MARCOS	Yeah.
 
KYLE	Hello.

HARTMANN	Did you really leave that girl there to die?
 
KYLE	It wasn't like that.

HARTMANN	So you're a coward now?

KYLE	Dad, I can... I can explain.

HARTMANN	I'm done listening to your explanations.

HARTMANN	You do whatever Marcos tells you or you're out on your own.

KYLE	I'll just go stay with Mom.

HARTMANN	Your mother's alimony runs out next year.

HARTMANN	Do you really think she can support your lifestyle?

HARTMANN	This is your last

HARTMANN	of a million last chances, Kyle.

HARTMANN	Don't waste it.

KYLE	Dad?

KYLE	Fuck.

KYLE	Was this his idea or yours?

MARCOS	Let's just say it was a meeting of minds.

KYLE	You know what you are, Marcos? You're a lapdog, someone to do his bidding.

KYLE	And when he's done with you, he'll throw your ass out 

KYLE	like he does with everyone he's finished with.

MARCOS	This is very simple, Kyle.

MARCOS	Get in the car or go back to jail.

MARCOS	Choice is yours.

MARCOS	It makes no difference to me either way.

CLOSE	Welcome to West Soay, Mr Hartmann.

CLOSE	I'm Mr Close, course principle.

CLOSE	This is Mr Maxwell, outdoor survival instructor.

KYLE	I don't need your instruction, OK?

MAXWELL	I can take care of myself.

MAXWELL	Where you come from, maybe that's true,

MAXWELL	but out here with that attitude, you could probably end up dead.

CLOSE	You're in a different world now, Hartmann.

CLOSE	There will be consequences for every choice you make.

CLOSE	Rule one: no lying.

CLOSE	Rule two: respect for fellow students and faculty.

CLOSE	Rule three: no sex.

CLOSE	Rule four: no fighting.

CLOSE	Rule five: absolute punctuality at all times.

CLOSE	I repeat, rule three: no sex.

MAXWELL	The course you're about to begin, Mr Hartmann,

MAXWELL	has been designed to give people like you,

MAXWELL	the spoiled, overprivileged offspring of the super rich,

MAXWELL	one last chance to make something of themselves.

MAXWELL	Now, this island will be your home for the next three months.

MAXWELL	I would suggest you follow its rules and regulations without question
MAXWELL	or suffer its punishments.

MAXWELL	Mr Herrick.

MAXWELL	I'm assigning Mr Hartmann to you here for orientation.

MAXWELL	Make sure he knows the drill.

KYLE	So what's with all the security guards? This a POW camp or what? 
 
HERRICK	Use your head, man. We're rich kids, valuable assets. 

HERRICK	We're human bearer bonds.

HERRICK	There are other issues here too,

HERRICK	like running off and getting lost in the woods.

HERRICK	If you want a hot shower, you split your own wood for the stove.

HERRICK	Here. Why don't you give it a go?

HERRICK	Looks like you could use one.

KYLE	No. You seem to be getting a good kick out of it. 

KYLE	I'll let you have all the fun.

HERRICK	Listen, entitled brat doesn't work here.

HERRICK	You pull your own weight or we all pay the consequences. 

HERRICK	There you go.

HERRICK	All right, that's you, that's me.

KYLE	Wait. We're sharing this room?

HERRICK	Yeah. Lucky me, right?

KYLE	So what was your crime?

HERRICK	Gambling.

HERRICK	I took a hit that almost bankrupt my folks. 

HERRICK	Dinner's at seven. They don't like it when you're late.

KYLE	Good for them.

SPECK	Looking a little green around the gills there, Sergeant Dorsey. 
 
SPECK	Guess three years in the glasshouse have softened you up. 

DORSEY	Last I remember, you were the one 
puking your guts overboard 
DORSEY	in the Persian Gulf... Sir.

SPECK	How are you? 

DORSEY	All right.
 
DORSEY	Who's the girl?

SPECK	Rachel Hennie. She's handling systems and comms. 

DORSEY	Stig Hennie's daughter? Are you serious?

SPECK	Trust me. She's a natural.

SPECK	And when it comes to the tough stuff, she takes it in her stride. 

DORSEY	Just a bunch of kids, right? Sure you wanna go down that route?

SPECK	Do whatever allows us to walk away clean.

SPECK	It's business as usual, mate.

SPECK	I didn't find God while you were doing time. 

DORSEY	I'm glad to hear it.

DORSEY	So who's paying for all this, then?

SPECK	Let's just say someone with lots to lose.

DORSEY	When do we move?

SPECK	When I get the call.

CLOSE	Rule five, Mr Hartmann.

CLOSE	It's now 15 minutes after seven.

KYLE	Sorry. I fell asleep.

KYLE	I'm still on US time.

AMY	You're so full of shit.

MAXWELL	Miss Tilton, please.

MAXWELL	A little exercise should help with that jet lag, Hartmann.

KYLE	Are you serious?

MAXWELL	None of your classmates eat until you're done.

MAXWELL	Outside.

MAXWELL	Outside.

MAXWELL	Right, three reps up and back. 

MAXWELL	Double time.
 
MAXWELL	One on each shoulder.
 
MAXWELL	Off you pop. 
 
MAXWELL	Move it!
 
MAXWELL	Come on, Hartmann. Get a move on.
 
MAXWELL	And again.
 
MAXWELL	Come on, you can do it.
 
MAXWELL	Good.
 
MAXWELL	Now you can take those ropes to the storeroom next to the main building.
 
MAXWELL	The sooner you're done,
 
MAXWELL	the sooner we dine.
 
MAXWELL	First impressions last, Mr Hartmann.
 
CLOSE	Right. Now that's over with...

CLOSE	Introductions, please.

THORNTON	All right, I'm James Thornton, Lexington, Kentucky.

KEIKO	Keiko Oshimoto, Tokyo, Japan.
 
PALOMA	Paloma Nava, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

AMY	Amy Tilton, Boston, and the Hamptons,

AMY	where I was recently left for dead by this cowardly piece of shit
 
AMY	who ran away.
 
KYLE	I didn't run away. I... I was out of it, OK?

KYLE	I hit my head. I don't...

AMY	You left me. That's what happened.

MARSAC	That is not a good look, mate. 

MARSAC	Leaving a damsel in distress while you take off like Road Runner. 

KYLE	What the fuck do you know about me?
 
MARSAC	Man, relax.
 
MARSAC	I'm just messing with you. 

MARSAC	I'm sure you had your reasons.

AMY	Yeah, like being a fucking pussy. 

MAXWELL	All right, enough.

MAXWELL	All of you.

MAXWELL	I have a question for you.
 
MAXWELL	What common thread do you think you all share?
 
FAYED	I have nothing in common with these people.
 
FAYED	My threads are made of silk. 

MARSAC	Doesn't matter what your panties are made of, Your Highness.

MAXWELL	You're all spoiled.

MAXWELL	Emotionally neglected.

MAXWELL	Seeking mindless stimulation through technology,

MAXWELL	booze, drugs, sex, cars, cash. (BOOZE: ALCOHOL)
 
MAXWELL	You will only discover who you really are if we take those things away.

THORNTON	What if this is who we really are?
 
THORNTON	I mean...
 
MAXWELL	Is this what you choose, Thornton, to be the kind of man
 
MAXWELL	that drives his car through the front window of a Starbucks

MAXWELL	and puts an innocent child in hospital

MAXWELL	'cause you're too busy texting to watch where you're going?

MAXWELL	Is that what's gonna define who you are? 

THORNTON	The kid was... he was fine.
 
MAXWELL	You're all here for the same reason. You screwed up.

MAXWELL	But there's hope.

MAXWELL	Somewhere in your DNA is an instinct to survive,
 
MAXWELL	and your time here is all about unearthing that instinct,
 
MAXWELL	uncovering who you really are and helping you forge real connections
 
MAXWELL	to the world around you and each other.
 
MAXWELL	You will learn to respect yourselves and each other.
 
MAXWELL	You will learn to take responsibility for your own actions.

MAXWELL	We're giving you the opportunity to reset.
 
MAXWELL	To start again.
 
MAXWELL	And if you don't keep up, you will be left behind.
 
MAXWELL	Now, since this is the last kitchen-cooked meal

MAXWELL	that you're gonna have for a week,
 
MAXWELL	eat up.
 
HARTMANN	As long as we continue to support our emerging artists, institutions like this 
will blossom and expand...
 
FRANZ	Excuse me, Mr Hartmann. Joe Franz, Metro News Journal.

HARTMANN	Who let you in?
 
FRANZ	Northern Core is about to become Hartmann Global Holdings.

FRANZ	That's a big story.
 
HARTMANN	Excuse me just a minute.
 
HARTMANN	I'm curious,

HARTMANN	how does a small-time hack like yourself 
 
HARTMANN	come across such privileged information?
 
FRANZ	I have my sources, and right now they're telling me
 
FRANZ	the future CEO of Hartmann Global Holdings 
 
FRANZ	just bribed a judge to keep his son out of jail.

HARTMANN	Careful. There might be no truth to that.
 
FRANZ	Your share prices go to hell even on a rumour like that,
 
FRANZ	maybe even the entire merger if people start digging.
 
FRANZ	I heard talk that if this thing falls down, you fall too.

HARTMANN	You may have managed to find one of my secrets, Mr Franz,
 
HARTMANN	but, rest assured, you do this
 
HARTMANN	and I'll make it my life's mission to find all of yours.
 
HARTMANN	I have dozens of litigation lawyers and private investigators
 
HARTMANN	just waiting to take your pathetic life
 
HARTMANN	and crush it beyond all recognition.

HARTMANN	Now run along.

HERRICK 	You won't get far.
 
CROFT	It's a nice morning for an escape, Mr Hartmann.

CROFT	It's not a swim I'd try, though.
 
CROFT	My name's Croft, Head of Security.
 
CROFT	This island is 60 miles from the nearest landfall.
 
CROFT	The North Atlantic's a far cry from Sag Harbour.
 
KYLE	I got my own money. I could pay you to get me out of here.
 
CROFT	Yeah?

KYLE	Yeah.

CROFT	I think I'll politely decline that offer.
 
CROFT	Now you get yourself back to bed, son,

CROFT	and I have no reason to tell anyone about this.
 
SPECK 	We'll stage from here, then use an inflatable to make the landing,

SPECK 	climb from there.
 
DORSEY	Gonna run into any weather?
 
SPECK 	Well, shipping forecast shows an Atlantic swell in 72 hours.

SPECK 	We'll be halfway to Norway by then.
 
DORSEY	Who else we got?
 
SPECK 	Couple of ex-marines I worked with after you got sent down. 
 
SPECK 	Good men. Work hard.
 
SPECK 	They've got seven pro guards up there. 

SPECK 	It's a bit of work in the dark but nothing we can't handle.
 
SPECK 	This is the one.
 
SPECK 	We get this done and we can say goodbye to working for hire.
 
DORSEY	Yeah, right. You'll never quit.
 
DORSEY	You love the heat too much. 

HENNIE	It's arranged.
 
HENNIE	Once the account is routed through the proxy,

HENNIE	the funds will be untraceable.
 
SPECK 	Told you she's the best.
 
HENNIE	What's up?
 
HENNIE	Cat got your tongue?
 

DORSEY	What's that?

HENNIE	It's a database.

HENNIE	Tells you all you need to know about the little fuckheads up there.
 
DORSEY	Where do these people get their money?
 
SPECK 	Their fathers steal it.

SPECK	Then they call it 'free enterprise.'
 
SPECK 	They never work a day in their lives.
 
DORSEY	Rich pricks.
 
HENNIE	You can let me know what rich prick feels like when you're one too.
 
DORSEY	What's the split?
 
SPECK	10 per cent.

DORSEY	Of what?

SPECK 	One billion dollars.
 
HENNIE	Think a thousand million...
 
HENNIE	...if you can't get your head around a billion.

SPECK 	Biggest fucking ransom in the history of the world, my friend.
 
MAXWELL	Right, you're gonna be outdoors for at least a week,
 
MAXWELL	so choose what you think you need to survive.
 
FAYED	I am not wearing another man's boots.
 
MAXWELL	Go barefoot. That's your choice.
 
MAXWELL	Now would be a very good time
 
MAXWELL	to start thinking about cause and effect.
 
MAXWELL	You choose badly, you live with the repercussions.
 
MAXWELL	Right.
 
MAXWELL	Edible Flora and Fauna of the British Isles.
 
MAXWELL	This is riveting stuff.
 
MAXWELL	Now, familiarise yourselves with food you can forage.

MAXWELL	There's no packed lunches here.
 
MAXWELL	You will eat what you can gather, trap or kill...
 
MAXWELL	...once your basic supplies run out, of course.
 
AMY	I'm not killing anything.
 
MAXWELL	Cause and effect, Miss Tilton.
 
MAXWELL	You're always welcome to go hungry
 
MAXWELL	while the rest of your fellow students eat.
 
MARSAC	Sweet.
 
MARSAC	Hey, Herrick, you're a gambler, right?
 
HERRICK	Depends who's asking.
 
MARSAC	You wanna bet who's gonna break rule three first?

THORNTON	You know what? I bet...
 
THORNTON	I bet that mouth of yours gets you in trouble one day.

MARSAC	Oh, Thornton, it already has, mate.
 
MARSAC	Why do you think I'm here?
 
HERRICK	Take it easy.
 
HERRICK 	Hey, Kyle.

HERRICK 	You wanna grab hold of one of these, just since you decided to stay.
 
FAYED	My father did not send me here to be a beast of burden.
 
MARSAC	Why did he send you here, then, Fayed,
 
MARSAC	other than to bore us all with your royal bullshit? 

FAYED	You know, I feel sorry for you, Marsac,

FAYED	growing up without any parents.
 
FAYED	No one to teach you to respect your superiors.

MARSAC	It's a lesson you must have missed. I'll teach you now, shall I, mate?

MARSAC	Come on, then. 

MAXWELL	That's enough!

MAXWELL 	Rule number four: no fighting.

MAXWELL	Let's get started.
 
MAXWELL	All right, Mr Herrick, let's have you on, please.

MARSAC	Go, Herrick.	

HERRICK	Hell, yeah.
 
HERRICK	Ready for some magic.
 
MAXWELL	Nothing like added bounce.
 
MAXWELL 	All right, ladies.

MAXWELL 	Going together, strength in numbers, here we go, please.

MAXWELL	Nice and easy.
 
MAXWELL	Nice bit of synchronised footwork.
 
MAXWELL	Ms Tilton. 

KYLE	Just be careful, all right?

MARSAC	OK, let's see it. Come on.
 
AMY	Years of ballet training.
 
MAXWELL	Very nimble.
 
HERRICK	Show us what you got, Amy.
 
AMY	I will.
 
AMY	I'll show you boys how it's really done.

MAXWELL	Well, that's something.
 
MAXWELL	Yeah, lovely.
 
MAXWELL	Very nice.
 
MAXWELL	Copied me, obviously.
 
MAXWELL	All right, who have we got next?

MAXWELL	Mr Hartmann, looking a bit pale.  
 
HERRICK	Hey, Marsac, four to one he bottles it. 

MARSAC	Yeah, all right, I'll take that.    

MAXWELL	You're doing great, Hartmann. Nice and calm.
 
FAYED	Looks like he has jelly legs.
 
MARSAC	Nothing like pure, unadulterated fear

MARSAC	to snap you into focus, right, Hartmann?
 
THORNTON	Right, Kyle, I'm coming after you, all right?
 
KYLE 	No. 

THORNTON	No, come on.


KYLE 	No, no, no, please.

MAXWELL	It's all right, Mr Hartmann.

MAXWELL	It's all right.

THORNTON	Nice and easy, Thornton.
 
MAXWELL	That's not easy, Thornton.
 
MAXWELL	Thornton, enough. That's enough.
 
MAXWELL	Come on, boy. Get it under control. Thornton.
 
KYLE	What the fuck are you doing? 

THORNTON	I'm trying to do it. Just go.
 
MAXWELL	Thornton, you stay still. 

KYLE:	Hartmann, just come on your own.
 
HERRICK 	Easy girls.
 
FAYED	Play nice.
 
MARSAC	Come on, Thornton. She's waiting for you on the other side, mate.
 
THORNTON 	Fuck off, Marsac.

MAXWELL	You did fine, Hartmann. Come on.
 
MAXWELL	You did good. Well done. That's it. Good work.
 
KYLE	OK. I got it.
 
FAYED	You're laughing too much. Let's see how you do.
 
MAXWELL	Come on, class clown.
 
MAXWELL	OK, Mr Marsac.
 
MAXWELL	Here we go.

MAXWELL	That's lovely work.
 
MAXWELL	All right, boys, you're doing fine. 

MAXWELL	Right.
 
MAXWELL	You have to think like your prey. 

MAXWELL	You get to know the animal, 

MAXWELL	its tracks, paths and routes, 

MAXWELL	and that... 

MAXWELL	is where you set the snare.
 
PALOMA	One bunny split nine ways is more of a snack than a meal. 
 
PALOMA	Is it even worth it?   MAXWELL There isn't an animal in the wilderness that can't be caught,
 
MAXWELL	big or small. 

MAXWELL	You just have to set the right trap in the right place.  
 
HERRICK 	Hartmann. Come on, rise and shine, buddy.
 
HERRICK 	We got a big day ahead. 

KYLE	What's your problem, Herrick? You got nothing better to do?
 
HERRICK 	Come here. 

KYLE	You're a real asshole, you know that? 

HERRICK 	Look around, buddy. I was doing you a favour.
 
HERRICK 	Everybody else is up. Remember what happened last time you were late? 

HERRICK 	Dick.

MAXWELL	Hartmann, I'm letting go of the safety.

KYLE	No, no, no, no, don't.
 
MAXWELL	So you can free-climb up like the others.
 
KYLE	No, no, no, please don't. Please.

HERRICK	No, fuck him. Leave him.

FAYED	I've seen donkeys with three legs move faster than this ass.

PAULSON	Just remember what I showed you.
 
PAULSON	Look for the hand and footholds,

PAULSON	think about how you're gonna get there, then move.

MARSAC	Come on, princess. It's just one hand in front of the other, not hard.
 
THORNTON	Can we just go?
 
MAXWELL	All right, let's give him ten to decide if he wants to climb
 
MAXWELL	or live on a ledge for the rest of his life.

MAXWELL	Up we go, kids.

KYLE	No, no, no, wait, please.

KYLE	Guys!
 
KYLE	Fuck!
 
AMY	Now you know what it feels like to be left hanging.
 
AMY	Not very fun, is it? Not knowing if anyone's coming back to get you.

KYLE	Please don't! Come back!
 
KYLE	Look, I can't move.
 
AMY	OK, listen to me. Just... breathe.

AMY	Pretend it's the climbing wall at Chelsea Piers.

AMY	You can do it.
 
AMY	See?
 
AMY	Fear is all in the mind.
 
AMY	Let's go.
 
KYLE	Hey. Thanks for back there.
 
KYLE	I'm not a huge fan of heights.
 
AMY 	Everyone's afraid of something. 

KYLE	Hey. Hey, Amy.
 
KYLE	Please.
 
KYLE	Look, I honestly don't remember what happened that night.
 
KYLE	I remember getting wasted and having a really great time, (DRUNK AND HIGH)

KYLE	but... I don't remember the crash at all.
 
KYLE	I don't know if I ran.
 
AMY	We should catch up to Maxwell before he lays the bait.

AMY	You're making something.
 
KYLE	Yeah.
 
KYLE	It's a fishing fly.
 
KYLE	My dad taught me how to make these when I was a kid.
 
KYLE	It was like a lifetime ago.
 
AMY	Take a look around.
 
AMY	It's beautiful, isn't it?
 
AMY	Clean air, trees,
 
AMY	no skyscrapers, no neon signs, no pollution.

AMY	Where would you be if you weren't here right now?
 
AMY	Getting wasted with a bunch of strangers?

AMY	Here we have all this space to think.
 
AMY	It's kind of nice.
 
KYLE	It sounds like Maxwell's getting to you.

AMY	Or maybe I just have a lot of thinking to do.
 
KYLE	About what?
 
AMY	Well, in five days I inherit the money my dad left me.
 
AMY	Yeah, and the truth is, I'm terrified
 
AMY	of letting him down,
 
AMY	screwing it up.
 
AMY	He gave me this before he died.
 
KYLE	'When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced.'
 
KYLE	'Live your life so that when you die, the world cries and you rejoice.'?
 
AMY	It's an old Cherokee saying.
 
AMY	I just don't want my life to mean nothing, you know?	
 
KYLE	So you're depressed because you got all this money coming in
 
KYLE	and you don't know how to spend it.
 
AMY	I thought you of all people might understand.
 
AMY	Guess I was wrong.

MAXWELL	Hartmann, I want you to cut its throat.
 
MAXWELL	Look, it's not easy to take a life,

MAXWELL	but sometimes it's the only thing that stands between you and survival.
 
KYLE	I can do it.
 
AMY	Great. We just killed Bambi. 
 
KEIKO	I give thanks to this beautiful creature
 
KEIKO	whose life we have taken
 
KEIKO	and to this land.
 
KEIKO	And also to all of you.
 
KEIKO	I was sent to this place 
as a punishment.
 
KEIKO	But for the first time in my life, I feel free.
 
KEIKO	And still my life is my own

KEIKO	and it's because of all of you.
 
KEIKO	It doesn't matter who our parents are. We don't have to be like them.
 
KEIKO	We can make our own lives.
 
KEIKO	We can be free.
 
MAXWELL	Amen to that.
 
MAXWELL	Very good. All right, fellas, dig in. 

AMY	It's tough.
 
MAXWELL	It's not tough. That's tender.

THORNTON	It's food.

HERRICK	Tender like you, Maxwell?
 
FAYED	Marsac, better than that goo they serve you in the orphanage, huh?

MARSAC	Bit of jungle music.
 
KEIKO	Music.
 
FAYED	I'm the only king of the jungle.

MARSAC	All right, come on.

MARSAC	King of the jungle!

SPECK	We're in position. You giving the green light or not?
 
SPECK	Roger that. 

KYLE	Birthday blues? 

AMY	Yeah, sort of. Just thinking about my dad.

AMY	Today's the day he gives me his last gift.
 
AMY	It just feels weird, you know?
 
KYLE	Listen to me.
 
KYLE	Your dad believed in you.
 
KYLE	It's why he gave you that note.

KYLE	He knew that you'd take the money
 
KYLE	and use it for something to make a difference.
 
KYLE	You just gotta believe in yourself. 
 
KYLE	You know, hating your stepdad because he's not your real dad,
 
KYLE	that's just gonna eat you up inside.
 
KYLE	That's what anger and hate does. Trust me, I should know.
 
KYLE	Maybe Maxwell's right, everybody deserves a second chance.
 
DORSEY	Are you ready?

SPECK	Time to move.
 
PAULSON	Ladies and gentlemen, please, take your seats.

SPECK	Move.
 
HENNIE	Man down.
 
MAXWELL	And happy birthday to Amy!

MARSAC	Speech!
 
AMY	You are so uncool, Mr Maxwell.
 
MAXWELL	I take that as the highest compliment, Miss Tilton.

FAYED	Waiter,   

FAYED	I would like a bottle of your finest champagne.

CLOSE	Yes, sir. We sell Crystal, sir. 
  
HERRICK	Come on. Cristal, Mr Close.
 
CLOSE 	That's what I said. Tuck in. 

HENNIE	Everybody say cheese! 

CLOSE	Come on, now. Who...

DORSEY	Down on the floor now!

MAXWELL 	All right, get up. 

SPECK	Take it easy, man. Take it easy.

AMY	Oh, my God!

HENNIE	Over there!

HENNIE	On the other side! 

SPECK 	Move!

HENNIE	Get down! Get down!

SPECK	Someone tell Miss Oshimoto to shut the fuck up.

MARSAC	Maxwell. Maxwell?

SPECK	You, get down. Come here. 

MARSAC	All right, all right.

SPECK	Move! 

HENNIE	On your knees!
 
DORSEY	Shut your fucking mouth.
 
HENNIE	Nobody else gets hurt if you do exactly what we tell you.
 
SPECK	Do as you're fucking told, all right?

SPECK	We're missing Hartmann.
 
SPECK	Where is he?
 
PALOMA	They've taken off their masks. 

SPECK	Shut up.

CLOSE	He didn't show up for dinner.

CLOSE	He is often late.
 
SPECK	You're supposed to know where everyone is at all times, Mr Close.
 
SPECK	Any ideas where he might be?
 
HENNIE	I don't want to have to hurt anyone.

HENNIE	Please don't make me have to.
 
AMY	He's in his room.
 
AMY	That's where I saw him last.

SPECK	Go.
 
SPECK	Do not fucking talk.

SPECK	Hartmann's your roommate. Where did he go?

HERRICK	He went... 

AMY 	We're not gonna tell you.

SPECK	Do you really think that worthless coward
 
SPECK	would do the same for you, Miss Tilton,
 
SPECK	or have you got a short memory?
 
AMY	You know nothing about him.
 
HENNIE	All we want to do is make sure he's safe.

HENNIE	It's cold out there,
 
HENNIE	dangerous.
 
HENNIE	Come on, Amy, why would we want to hurt any of you?
 
HENNIE	You're worth nothing to us dead.
 
SPECK	Put them somewhere secure. 
 
SPECK	Of course I understand the complications.
 
SPECK	We'll find him.
 
SPECK	This is just a minor glitch and will be resolved quickly.
 
SPECK	Yeah, understood.
 
SPECK	Look, I need Hartmann here and I need him here now.
 
SPECK	Clock's ticking. 

DORSEY 	All right.
 
DORSEY	He's just a frightened kid. We'll handle it.
 
SPECK	Good.

THORNTON	Hey.
THORNTON	You OK?
HERRICK	We're gonna be fine, OK? 
HERRICK	Our parents are gonna pay up and then we all get to go home.
MARSAC	Your parents.
MARSAC	I don't have any parents.
MARSAC	I have a board of trustees.
MARSAC	Do you really think these fuckers are stupid enough
MARSAC	to try and get money out of a bunch of lawyers?
PALOMA	What do you mean?
MARSAC	I mean I'm on my own.
MARSAC	So if your parents need any extra persuasion,
MARSAC	guess who's gonna get a bullet first.
FAYED	It will not come to that.
FAYED	I'm sure our parents will cover your share.
THORNTON	Yeah. Yeah, let's just hope that doesn't cause any problems.
HERRICK	Hey.
MARSAC	Oh, fuck.
MARSAC	What, I'm a fucking problem now
MARSAC	'cause my parents are dead, is that it?
HERRICK	That is not what he meant.
MARSAC	That's what it fucking sounded like.
AMY	Enough! Shut up! Shut the fuck up.
AMY	We have to stick together now.
HERRICK	Why don't you tell that to Kyle,
HERRICK	when he comes out from whatever rock he's hiding under?
AMY	He just did what any one of us would have done.
HERRICK	No.
AMY	And, besides, he's worth a lot more to us out there
AMY	than he is tied up in here.
AMY	If he can help us, he will. I know he will.
HERRICK	I really hope he doesn't let you down.
HERRICK	Fuck.
HARTMANN	Jesus Christ.
SPECK	To all parents. We have your children.
SPECK	They are alive and will remain so
SPECK	provided you follow our instructions precisely.
SPECK	At 1800 Eastern Standard Time tomorrow,
SPECK	you are to convene at a secure location,
SPECK	the coordinates for which will be sent to Mr Robert Hartmann.SPECK	 You will wait there until further contact.
SPECK	Mr Hartmann, it is your responsibility
SPECK	to arrange transportation.
SPECK	Anyone who chooses not to attend,
SPECK	be aware that your child's life will be terminated.
SPECK	The ransom is one billion dollars and is non-negotiable.
HARTMANN	I didn't see Kyle.
MARCOS	What do you wanna do? 
HARTMANN	They're holding all the cards.(IDOMATIC: HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGES)
HARTMANN	We do whatever they say.
CROFT	Jesus Christ, Hartmann, it's me, it's Croft.
KYLE	Don't you fucking move.
CROFT	Fuck, am I glad to...
KYLE	I said stay back!
CROFT	OK. I thought you were one of them.
CROFT	They slaughtered everybody at the bunkhouse.
KYLE	So why the hell'd they spare you?
CROFT	I saw it happen. I ran away. I'm not a hero, OK?
KYLE	You did nothing?
CROFT	Look, what use is one gun against them?
CROFT	I reckon our best bet is to get to the shore boat, right?
CROFT	Pray to God it's still in one piece.
CROFT	At least we'd stand a better chance of getting help.
KYLE	Fine.

KYLE	We gotta go right now. 
CROFT	I've got him. We're on our way.
CROFT	It's just a bit of business, kid.
CROFT	You say hi to your mum and dad, we get paid,
CROFT	you and your buddies can go home.
CROFT	Move.
CROFT	Keep moving.
CROFT	Stop it!
EMILY	Why would they bring us here?
AHMED	Because it's in the middle of nowhere.
FRANCES	...call the FBI. there and then. 
THOMAS	Darling, please. You can't ju...
FRANCES	Don't tell me what I can and can't do.
THOMAS	Welcome. I'm Thomas Herrick and this is my wife, Frances.
FRANCES	What took you so long? 
JONATHAN	Jonathan Tilton-Schofield.
JONATHAN	This is my wife, Emily.
JONATHAN	We got here as fast as we could.
THOMAS	You're wasting your time. There's no power.
THOMAS	I don't get it.
THOMAS	Why go to the bother of bringing it in when you can't turn it on?
HARTMANN	They wouldn't.
JONATHAN	Maybe there's a generator here somewhere.
JONATHAN	I could take a look.
JONATHAN	Mr Thornton, care to give me a hand?
DREW	Of course.
DREW	I mean, it's been a while since I had a chance to get my hands dirty.
LISA	So... you still think grounding our son
LISA	halfway round the world was such a good idea?
HARTMANN	Well, it wasn't your call to make, was it?(CALL: DECISION)
LISA	I would never have sent him to that place... ever.
LISA	Lisa Hartmann, Kyle's mother.
FRANCHESCA	Franchesca. My daughter is Paloma.
EMILY	Emily Tilton-Schofield. I'm Amy's mom.
FRANCHESCA	When did you arrive? 
LISA	About an hour ago.
LISA	I travelled with the Herricks.
LISA	Had a look around. There's not much here.
LISA	There's a bathroom, a kettle. No food.
LISA	They don't want us to be too comfortable.
FRANCES	Agreeing to come out here was a mistake.
FRANCES	I really think we should at least discuss the possibility
FRANCES	of handing the situation over to trained professionals.
JONATHAN	Well, we found a power switch at least.
HARTMANN	I hear what you're saying, Mrs Herrick.
HARTMANN	But contacting the FBI is just not an option.
HARTMANN	If we call them,
HARTMANN	we are effectively signing our children's death warrants.
FRANCES	Where are the other parents?
HARTMANN 	Marsac is a trust fund baby.
HARTMANN	No parents to negotiate with.
HARTMANN	And we may have an issue with Oshimoto.
HARTMANN	I'm not sure he's going to pay.
FRANCES	Oh, my God.
FRANCHESCA	He will pay.
FRANCHESCA	It's his daughter.
HARTMANN	I'm dealing with it.
HARTMANN	So it won't be a problem.
DREW	But if it is, who's gonna make up the shortfall?
AHMED	I can cover Mr Oshimoto's share if it comes to that.
FRANCHESCA	I'm sure if we pool our resources, we could manage Marsac's between us.
FRANCES	With what? This will leave us with nothing.
DORSEY	It took a while, but I've just found Croft. He's dead.
DORSEY	His neck's broken.
SPECK	You think this was Hartmann?
DORSEY	Who else? I found Croft's weapon
DORSEY	at the bottom of the cove.
DORSEY	His radio's gone.
DORSEY	Do you want me to keep searching?
SPECK	No.
SPECK	It'll be dark soon. Come back in.
SPECK	Croft's dead. Must have been careless.
HENNIE	Want me to go help Dorsey?
SPECK	No.
SPECK	He's heading back. We stick to the plan for now.
SPECK	You make your tapes. We might need them.
SPECK	Hartmann.
SPECK	You out there?
SPECK	Well, if you are, I've gotta congratulate you.
SPECK	You took down one of my best men.
SPECK	But enough's enough.
SPECK	If you come in now,
SPECK	we can get this over and done with.
SPECK	Everyone can go home safe and sound.
SPECK	The alternative is I'll come after you
SPECK	and I won't stop until you're dead.
SPECK	Or maybe I'm just talking to myself.
SPECK	Kyle?
FAYED	They are telling me to send this tape to you. Please save me.
MARSAC	Look, I'm not the same as everyone else, all right?
MARSAC	I don't have people to talk to. I don't know what you want me to say.
DORSEY	Fucking speak!
KEIKO	Please, do what these people are asking of you.
KEIKO	Give us a chance to work everything out.
THORNTON	Please just go along with everything they say.
HENNIE	You're next, sweetie.
HERRICK	Why's she shutting the fucking door?
DORSEY	Shut up. I said shut your fucking mouth.
HENNIE	I just want you to look pretty for your close-up, Amy.
HENNIE	You know, I'm really not so different to you.
HENNIE	Maybe in another situation we could even have been friends.
HENNIE	Pretty cool to fall for a guy in a place like this.
HENNIE	Believe me, I know how hard it is
HENNIE	to find someone you can really connect with.
AMY	Do you really think that I'm stupid enough to trust you?
AMY	There isn't a place in this entire universe
AMY	that you and I would ever, ever be friends.
HENNIE	You know, I've done my research.
HENNIE	I know all about you.
HENNIE	The drugs, the one-night stands.
HENNIE	Now be a good girl and say hi to Mummy.
SPECK	Did you get anything from Tilton?
HENNIE	No, not yet. But I could force it from her.
HENNIE	We're getting rid of them all anyway, right?
SPECK	Course. Keep 'em in the equipment room for now.
SPECK	We'll have our partner asking questions
SPECK	and I've got nothing to say.
SPECK	Hartmann's important.
SPECK	If we can't find him, there could be complications.
HENNIE	We can always cut and run.
HENNIE	If there's too much heat.
SPECK	No, fuck that.
SPECK	Pay-off's too rich on this one.
SPECK	Besides, I wanna see the look on this little prick's face
SPECK	when I throw him off a fucking cliff.
SPECK	These people are parasites. They don't deserve to live.
SPECK	All right, I've gotta make this call.
EMILY	You brought guns? Why would you do that?
DREW	We're fish in a barrel here.
DREW	I'm not leaving myself completely defenceless.
DREW	One .243 Rigby and a pair of Purdeys. 
AHMED	Answer it.
SPECK	Looks like we're missing a few people.
SPECK	My instructions were very clear.
HARTMANN	Oshimoto is delayed.
HARTMANN	Marsac is an orphan.
SPECK	Well, I assume you've thought of ways to make up the shortfall.
HARTMANN	That's really none of your business,
HARTMANN	and I'm not discussing the ransom with you until I see my son.
SPECK	Your son ran off when he saw his friends in trouble.
SPECK	Once a coward, always a coward, huh?
SPECK	This is not a business negotiation.
SPECK	I meant what I said about the consequences of non-compliance.
HARTMANN	And I meant what I said.
HARTMANN	If we don't get proof of life,
HARTMANN	you don't get the money.
 AHMED	You have no right! 
FRANCHESCA	 Are you mad?
FRANCES	Who said you could speak for us?
HARTMANN 	I'm sure he'll call back.
AHMED	This is reckless.
HARTMANN	My son is unaccounted for.AHMED TO HARTMANN:There are other lives at stake here.
JONATHAN	I think Mr Hartmann is right, I'm sure that they will call back
JONATHAN	and with it proof that all of our children are alive.
JONATHAN	It's just a matter of time.
KYLE	Maxwell!
SPECK	Dorsey, get back here in here.
THORNTON	Fuck, man.
PALOMA	No way. I don't believe it. 
HERRICK	Kyle.
HERRICK	Son of a bitch. 
AMY	You came back.
KYLE	Yeah
AMY	Am I happy to see you!
HERRICK	You should be halfway to the Hamptons by now, buddy.
KYLE	I hope you didn't bet on it.
HERRICK	No.
PALOMA	Let's get you out.
KYLE	Look, you're better at this stuff than me.
KYLE	OK, we need to get supplies and we gotta go right now.
KYLE	They're not fucking around.(COARSE SLANG: MESSING AROUND)
KYLE	They're gonna kill us, ransom or no ransom.
HERRICK	OK.
HERRICK	Guys, grab what you can, supplies, equipment, anything.
HERRICK	We gotta go now.
HERRICK	Marsac
KYLE	Let's go.

SPECK	I will not let this little prick turn my operation into a circus.
SPECK	Bring me Tilton. If she knows something, she's gonna tell us now.  
SPECK	What?
KYLE	OK, Marsac, Fayed, you, Amy, Keiko,
KYLE	head up the north trail to the old farm.
KYLE	OK? We know there's shelter there.
THORNTON 	No, we're not splitting up. Why?
 KYLE	Because two groups are harder to track than one, all right?
 KYLE	So stay out of sight and cover your tracks, OK?
 HERRICK	We need to go now.
 KEIKO	See you later.
 SPECK	He's just a frightened kid.
 SPECK	Yet he's managed to take out one of our men
 SPECK	and release seven fucking hostages on our watch.
DORSEY	They can't have gone far. 
DORSEY	We'll track themand we'll bring them back.
HENNIE	They have no way of getting off the island.
 HENNIE	It's just a matter of flushing them out.
SPECK	Then do it. I want them found by morning.
 SPECK	No more fucking surprises.
AMY 	You OK? 
KEIKO	Yeah, I'm fine. I'm coming, OK?
AMY	OK.
FRANCES	If they were gonna call back, they would have done it by now.
FRANCHESCA	Maybe they are looking for the boy. 
FRANCES	Or maybe they've lost patience.
FRANCES	We're wasting time here.
HARTMANN	Any word from Oshimoto?
MARCOS	Not yet, but I've been crunching the numbers. 
MARCOS	We can cash for the ransom,
MARCOS	but if we take that money out of the business, it will kill the merger,
MARCOS	which leaves us in a potentially difficult position.
HARTMANN	You mean that leaves me potentially bankrupt
HARTMANN	and you potentially unemployed?
 MARCOS	Well, let's not get melodramatic here, Bobby.
MARCOS	There are always solutions.
HARTMANN	Westcom said no, Marcos.
HARTMANN	Unless I can find 250 million,
HARTMANN	the merger's dead in the water, ransom or not.
HARTMANN	Call me back when you hear from Oshimoto.
KYLE	Keep moving.
JONATHAN	How are you holding up?
HARTMANN	Same as the rest of you.
HARTMANN	Waiting for the phone to ring.
HARTMANN	Look, I know it was a risk.
HARTMANN	But I have to make sure that my son is OK.
HARTMANN	All any of us ever try to do is protect our children, right?
JONATHAN	Our children?
JONATHAN	That's funny.
HARTMANN 	What's funny?
JONATHAN	Nothing, nothing.
DREW	Whisky?
JONATHAN	It's just my Amy was the girl who was with Kyle
JONATHAN	the night he wrecked his car.
JONATHAN	I was the one who agreed to keep it quiet when you bribed that judge.
JONATHAN	But how were you to know about that?
JONATHAN	I mean, you had your best man deal with it.
JONATHAN	And it must be nice to have a man like Shah
JONATHAN	get his hands dirty for you. 
JONATHAN	And I suppose that's why they made you the point of contact,
JONATHAN	because you've got a history of getting exactly what you want.
HARTMANN	Yeah? 
MARCOS	I've heard back from Oshimoto.
HARTMANN	I'm putting you on speaker.
MARCOS	Oshimoto's people have calculated the odds of his daughter surviving
MARCOS	at 30/70.
MARCOS	He's out. He's not paying.
HARTMANN	Based on what?
MARCOS	Kidnappings over the last ten years.
MARCOS	Maybe he has a point.
DREW	So you're saying 'cause we can't trust these guys,  
DREW	we shouldn't pay 'em? 
MARCOS	That's not for me to say.
MARCOS	But... could call their bluff.
MARCOS	Likelihood is they're not gonna go through with their threat.
MARCOS	Killing kids? To what end?
HARTMANN	And if they do go through with it?
MARCOS	Let's be honest here.
MARCOS	These kids have caused you
MARCOS	nothing but grief.
MARCOS	Maybe you'd all be better off.
HARTMANN	Marcos, you remember our conversation earlier about you being unemployed?
MARCOS	Yes.
HARTMANN	That time has come.
KYLE	Hey.
KYLE	What is it?
AMY	It's Keiko.
THORNTON	Is she hurt?
AMY	She didn't tell us in time.
AMY	She didn't wanna hold us back. 
THORNTON	How bad?
AMY	We couldn't stop the bleeding. She's dead.
AMY	I'm so sorry.
THORNTON	What? What do you mean, she's...
THORNTON 	She's not fucking dead. 
HERRICK:	 Thornton.
AMY	Kyle!
HENNIE	Kyle Hartmann.
HENNIE	I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to meeting you.
SPECK	I will not let this little prick turn my operation into a circus.
SPECK	Bring me Tilton. If she knows something, she's gonna tell us now.

HENNIE	Kyle Hartmann.
HENNIE	I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to meeting you.
KYLE	Yeah, well, I can't say the same about you.
HENNIE	That hurts. Now drop the bow.
HENNIE	Drop the bow!
HENNIE	On your knees!
HENNIE	On your knees.
HENNIE	Hands behind your back.
HENNIE	I can't wait to see Amy's face
HENNIE	when I hand her her boyfriend's head on a plate.
HENNIE	Kind of poetic, don't you think? Biblical, almost.
KYLE	OK, are you ready?
AMY	Just do it.
AMY 	One, two, three. 
KYLE	 Two, three.
KYLE	Hey, hey. All right, hey, you're doing great. We're almost there.
AMY	I think I'm having an out-of-body experience.
KYLE	What the hell is wrong with you?
KYLE	Why would you risk your life like that?
AMY	You risked your life for us. I was... I was just returning the favour.
KYLE	Are you crazy?
AMY	Maybe I am.
CHAMBLISS	This is FBI Special Agent Jess Chambliss.
CHAMBLISS	Don't worry, this is a secure line.
CHAMBLISS	We understand your concern for your children's safety,
 CHAMBLISS	but you have done the right thing in contacting us.
FRANCES	I'm sorry about your son, Mr Hartmann,
FRANCES	but somebody had to do something.
CHAMBLISS	We are working with the UK authorities
CHAMBLISS	and together we are drawing up plans
CHAMBLISS	for the safe recovery of your children.
HARTMANN	Plans? What plans?
CHAMBLISS	I'm afraid I can't discuss that at this time, Mr Hartmann.
HARTMANN	I'll have my jet back here within the hour.
HARTMANN	I'll be in Scotland in less than seven.
CHAMBLISS	Mr Hartmann, I strongly advise you to stay where you are.
CHAMBLISS	By going out there, you jeopardise not only your own safety
CHAMBLISS	but the success of the recovery mission.
HARTMANN	I'm done leaving my son's life in other people's hands.
HARTMANN	I'm not going to sit and wait for you guys to bring me bad news.
CHAMBLISS 	Mr Hartmann... 
JONATHAN	 Bobby, wait.
CHAMBLISS 	Mr Hartmann. 
JONATHAN	I'd like to come along.
JONATHAN	See if I can help.
LISA	What are you gonna do when you get there?
HARTMANN	Whatever I have to do.
AMY	I have to rest, Kyle.
KYLE	We can't. We can't rest here.
AMY	Then you have to go without me.
AMY	I can slow them down, give you a chance to get ahead.
KYLE	Amy, I'm not going anywhere without you, OK?
KYLE	Not this time.
KYLE	How's that? That better?
DORSEY	Don't be stupid! Automatic weapon versus a bow and arrow?
DORSEY	Fucking throw it to the ground now.
DORSEY	Now!
HERRICK	Stop, stop. OK.
DORSEY	Stand out where I can see you!
DORSEY	You! Drop your weapon now.
THORNTON	No.
DORSEY	What the fuck do you mean, no?
THORNTON	I mean no.
THORNTON	I'm not gonna drop it.
DORSEY	Why are you determined to do this the hard way?
DORSEY	Drop it or I will shoot you in your fucking head.
DORSEY	Everybody stand still!
THORNTON	What would you do if we all rushed you right now?
THORNTON	Would you kill us all?
DORSEY	I've killed more people than I can fucking count, mate.
DORSEY	Yeah? What's another four?
DORSEY	Don't move!
KYLE	If you do that, you get nothing,
KYLE	no ransom.
THORNTON	Is that what you came here for?
THORNTON	To leave with nothing?
DORSEY	I think we can afford to kill one of you. Yeah?
DORSEY	And we'll see how brave the rest of you really fucking are.
DORSEY	Just do it.
PALOMA	We heard shooting.
KYLE	Two more of them are dead now.
THORNTON	There's still one left. 
HERRICK	He's probably gonna keep coming, just like he said.
KYLE	Then we'll let him.
FAYED	Hartmann.
FAYED	I don't understand why you want to take him alive.
MARSAC	Yeah, we have got a gun, right?
MARSAC	All we've gotta do is hide until he appears and then shoot him. 
AMY	Not if we don't have to.
MARSAC	Of course we have to.
MARSAC	We've gotta kill him before he kills us.
MARSAC	Why are we even discussing this? 
KYLE	Because it's not who we are.
KYLE	We're not killers.
KYLE	Everything we did was in self-defence.
KYLE	But this is different, OK? We have a choice.
MARSAC	Fuck!
AMY	Hey, killing someone isn't as easy as you think, Marsac.
HERRICK	All right, Kyle, what's the plan?
KYLE	It's like Maxwell said,
KYLE	if we can set the right trap in the right place, we can catch anything.
KYLE	So does anybody know how to use this?
HERRICK	I've never shot a gun before. I don't even know what that thing is.
THORNTON	It's a Bushmaster M16 .223 calibre.
THORNTON	It's automatic. Clip holds about 30 rounds.
THORNTON	Rate of fire is 800rpm.
THORNTON	My dad has one in his collection. 
KYLE	Well, you just volunteered.
KYLE	OK. Keep out of sight until he passes.
KYLE	When he does, follow him at a safe distance.
KYLE	If he starts to turn back, fire a few shots in the air.
KYLE	That should keep him in the right direction, OK?
KYLE	You got this?
KYLE	OK.
MARSAC	No, Amy, don't!
SPECK	I'm guessing this isn't the way you saw this going.
SPECK	Throw them away now.
SPECK	Throw them!
SPECK	Hartmann!
SPECK	Don't you think it's time we met?
SPECK	I'm done playing games with you.
SPECK	Well, haven't you been a busy boy?
SPECK	Got a decent bit of blood on your hands.
SPECK	Actually, I should thank you.
SPECK	See, I'm flying solo now. No one to share the ransom with.
KYLE	You still think that's gonna happen?
SPECK	I know it's gonna happen.
SPECK	I know exactly how much of an investment you are to your parents.
SPECK	Now, if you don't march all your friends down here
SPECK	in the next 30 seconds,
SPECK	I'm gonna shoot your girlfriend in the fucking face.
SPECK	I wouldn't take too much time to think on it.
KYLE	Run!
AMY	Marsac! No!
SPECK	Hartmann!
FAYED	Marsac!
AMY	Your son was pretty incredible out there, Mr Hartmann.
HARTMANN	Sounds like he wasn't alone there.
HARTMANN	You're Amy, aren't you?
HARTMANN	It's nice to finally meet you in person.
AMY	Likewise.
AMY	I'll let you two catch up.
AMY	I can't believe you came.
JONATHAN	Well, I care about you, Amy.
JONATHAN	More than you realise.
HARTMANN	It's hard to believe that this guy Speck
HARTMANN	planned this whole thing on his own.
JONATHAN	I suppose the only thing we're certain of now
JONATHAN	is that there's no one left to question.
AMY	Why don't you answer it, Jonathan?
AMY	You wanna tell us why the last seven calls on Speck's sat phone
AMY	came from the one you're holding?
AMY	You couldn't get your grubby hands on my father's money,
 AMY	so you found a way to get your own, am I right?
JONATHAN	I don't know what she's talking about. She's hysterical.
HARTMANN	Innocent people are dead because of you.
AMY	My father taught me to live my life trying to make a difference.
AMY	You've taught me why.
JONATHAN	I've done nothing. She's making it up.
JONATHAN	She's never liked me. This is crazy!
KYLE	You OK?
