GARY	Say you love me.

SABRINA	Previously on "Sistas…"

ANDI	I love you.

CALVIN	I'm a cool dude.  I work hard.  I'd really like to take you out.

ANDI	I just got the largest divorce settlement my firm has ever seen.

ALL	(cheering)

ZAC	I never had a woman like you before.

KAREN	And you never will again.

DANNI	Damn, you fine, Gary.  We've been waiting to meet this mystery man for 6 months!

ANDI	Thank you for not telling the girls that Gary's married.  First, I'd like to say I hate that we're here to talk about divorce.

JASMIN	Where do we start?

ANDI	Let's start with your husband's name.

JASMIN	Gary Marshall Borders.

ANDI	I'm sorry.  What was his name?

JASMIN	Gary Marshall borders.

ANDI	(stammers) I'm sorry.  Would you like some water?

JASMIN	No, thanks.  I'm fine.  I'm used to the heat.  I'm from Albuquerque.

ANDI	Right.  Ok.  Would you excuse me for a moment?

JASMIN	Yeah.  Sure.

ANDI	I had too much coffee.

JASMIN	Mmm.  Gotcha.  Yeah, no worries.

ANDI	Ok, thanks.  (breathing hard)

KAREN	Ok, I didn't make it.

ANDI	Karen.

KAREN	Ok, yeah, well, I know you didn't either, ok?  Why was you so weak?

ANDI	Karen…

KAREN	Don't call me judging me, ok?  At least Zac is not married.

ANDI	Karen!  She's here.

KAREN	Who?

ANDI	His wife.

KAREN	Where?

ANDI	(sighs) She's in my office.

KAREN	Wait.  What the hell you talkin' about?

ANDI	The woman I won all that money for?  She recommended me to her.

KAREN	Oh, that's a good thing.

ANDI	No, the hell it's not.

KAREN	Well, it means he's telling the truth.  He's getting a divorce.

ANDI	(grunts) You don't understand.  She wants me to represent her.

KAREN	Oh, hell, no!  You can't do that.

ANDI	I know that.

KAREN	Well, just give her to someone else.  Give her to another lawyer.

ANDI	She cannot be represented here at all.  That is a clear conflict.

KAREN	Well, then, you gotta tell your boss.

ANDI	What, that I am sleeping with a married man?

KAREN	Andi, what else you gonna do?  You just got the job.

ANDI	(sighs) I know, and I have never made this much money.

KAREN	(on phone) What you gonna do, girl?

ANDI	I don't know.

KAREN	Look, you better figure it out.

ANDI	(on phone) I'm gonna call you back.

KAREN	Ok.  Bye.

SINGER	Don't my girls hold me down.  Let them boys mess around.  My love life is a headache.  We're going out tonight.  'Cause I'm into the love.

ANDI	Sir, I need to talk to you.

AARON	What are you doing?  She's waiting.

ANDI	Yes, I know, but I just need to tell you something before I go back in there.

AARON	Andi, talk to her first.

ANDI	I think that she needs another lawyer, sir.

AARON	Why?

ANDI	Because I am not suitable to handle this case.

DON	I hate to be blunt, but Helen said she wanted a black woman.  She referred you to her.  What's the problem?

ANDI	I think that there may be a conflict of interest.

DON	Listen, this is just cold feet, ok?  You got this.  You're gonna be great at it.  You made $6 million for this firm in just 2 cases and 800,000 for yourself. This is another big one.  Go on.  Go get it.  We're counting on you.  Make this work.

ANDI	Yes, sir.

JASMIN	(sighs)

ANDI	So sorry.

JASMIN	(sniffles) No.  (crying) I'm sorry.  I just…I never thought it would come to this.  I just…I love him so much.  But I have to have standards, you know?  I mean, you have to hold them to the fire at some point, otherwise they'll run all over you.  (sniffles)
ANDI	I…have a really great associate who has been with us for many years, and he…

JASMIN	No.

ANDI	He has handled over 400 divorces.

JASMIN	No.

ANDI	He would be perfect.

JASMIN	No, no, no.  (sniffles) I want you.  Helen said that you are the best and that you are almost like a therapist to her.  And now she's so happy.  I just want to get out of this thing happy.  Okay?  So I want you, you and only you.  That man took my entire life.  He owes me!  Bastard.  (sniffles)

ANDI	(clears throat) May I ask why you want a divorce?

JASMIN	How much time you got?  I got lots of reasons.

ANDI	Such as?

JASMIN	He's a liar.  A cheater…

ANDI	Cheater?

JASMIN	An abuser…

ANDI	An abuser?

JASMIN	Yes.  And I know he's cheating with someone, and I'm sick of it!

ANDI	Has he done this before?

JASMIN	Yes.

ANDI	Do you have proof of his affairs?

JASMIN	He's careful, so careful.  And whoever this woman is, she's different.  He showers more.  He wears different clothes.  I hear him whispering.  And I want to know who that bitch is!

ANDI	I'm sorry.

JASMIN	No.  Don't be.  It's not your fault.  Look, I know he's gonna leave me, but I want to beat him to it.  So I hired a private detective.  (sniffles)

ANDI	Do they have anything?

JASMIN	As I said, he's careful.  But I know he's gonna find something soon.  I think that she's at his gym.

ANDI	W-why do you think that?

JASMIN	The private detective follows him to the gym at 5 a.m.  He parks at the building across the street, but doesn't appear to the gym until an hour later.  You can help me…can't you?

ANDI	Tell me more, and I will see what I can do.

JASMIN	Okay.  On saturdays, we're supposed to meet at the mall.

ZAC	I'm sorry.

KAREN	(sighs) About last night?

ZAC	About everything.

KAREN	I hear you.

ZAC	But you don't accept my apology?

KAREN	Zac, look…

ZAC	Listen, I just…I just want things to go back to the way they were.

KAREN	Then you shouldn't have done what you did!

ZAC	I know!  I know!  But what's done is done.  Can we just move forward?

KAREN	That ain't how it works, Zac.

ZAC	'Cause you want to be mad.

KAREN	No.  'Cause I'm hurt.  You know what…you don't get this.  And this selfish-ass conversation that you are having with me right now just continues to inform me that you don't get this.

ZAC	I get it.

KAREN	No, you don't.  You think just 'cause I (…) you last night it's all good?  We cool?

ZAC	If I can recall, I did all the…

KAREN	We got jokes right now?

ZAC	No, I don't--I'm just trying to make you laugh.

KAREN	By telling a joke about fuckin'…you know what that just made me think about?  You and her.  You know what I was thinkin' about last night when you was on your knees?  How you did that to her.

ZAC	Why would you be thinking about her?  This between you and me.

KAREN	You know what, can you just get out?

ZAC	(sighs)

KAREN	'Cause I regret last night for sure.

ZAC	Okay, all right, you was weak.  I was weak.  But you still mad, and I'm still in the doghouse.  All I'm saying is we gotta move forward.  That's all, baby.	

KAREN	No.  That ain't all.

ZAC	Then what?

KAREN	You forgot one thing.

ZAC	What?  You still want me to leave?

KAREN	Damn right.

ZAC	(sighs) You know what…I'm not even trying to upset you right now.  You got a long day ahead of you.  I won't be here when you get back.

KAREN	Okay.  That's for the best.

ZAC	(scoffs) Okay.

SABRINA	(on phone) What?

KAREN	And then he said he wouldn't be there when I got home.  (scoffs)

SABRINA	(on phone) Well, that's what you wanted.

KAREN	No, it ain't!

SABRINA	You asked him to leave.

KAREN	Well, why didn't he wake up and just agree?

SABRINA	(on phone) Karen--

KAREN	No.  You know what, he came into my bedroom last night, okay?  I know he heard my vibrator.  He knew I was horny.  He knew that he'd got to me.

SABRINA	Okay, will you calm down?

KAREN	He played me.

SABRINA	He did not play you.  You asked him to leave.

KAREN	Well, he should have stayed.

SABRINA	Didn't we have a conversation about mixed signals?

KAREN	This is not a mixed signal, 'Brina.  I wonder if that ho texted him.

SABRINA	Karen…

KAREN	Nope.  That is what happened, 'Brina.  She texted him, and she told him to come on over.  She told him to come on!

SABRINA	You know I hate it when you go down this rabbit hole.

KAREN	I'm telling you!

SABRINA	(on phone) But you don't know that to be true.

KAREN	You know what, I know who will.

SABRINA	Uh-uh.  Karen, no.  Do not involve Danni.  Please don't involve her.  You know she's like the Insta-FBI.  She's gonna be all over social media trying to put this all together.

KAREN	Okay, I'm not gonna tell her, okay?  'Cause I ain't runnin' after him no more.

SABRINA	Good.  Look, I gotta go 'cause I gotta open up this bank, and I will talk to you later.

KAREN	Okay.

SABRINA	And tell Danni I said hi.

KAREN	(on phone) What?

SABRINA	Oh, you will be calling her by lunch.

KAREN	No, I will not, okay?  Bye.

SABRINA	Oh, okay.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye.

KAREN	Shit.

SABRINA	(sighs) Oh, good morning!

MAURICE	Sabrina, I just wanted you to witness this.

DELIVERY MAN	I've got a delivery for…

MAURICE	Me, darling.

DELIVERY MAN	Are you Sabrina Hollins?	

SABRINA	Oh!

MAURICE	No, that thot is right there.

SABRINA	You a hater.  That's me.

DELIVERY MAN	(chuckles) Sign right here.

SABRINA	Thank you.  Wow.

MAURICE	Ugly-ass flowers.  I don't like 'em no way.  What you signin', girl?  The declaration of independence?

DELIVERY MAN	Thank you.

SABRINA	Thank you so much.

MAURICE	Who they from?

SABRINA	Mmm…Calvin.

MAURICE	Hmm.

SABRINA	Oh, "thanks for a great dinner "and I can't wait to see you again so you can tell me it was black." ha!  (laughs)

MAURICE	What's black?

SABRINA	Mmm…we were at dinner, and he was just making this joke about how my dress is blue, but it's black.  (laughs) It was super funny.

MAURICE	That don't sound funny to me.

SABRINA	You are the worst.

MAURICE	So, did you sleep with him, girl?

SABRINA	What are you talking about?

MAURICE	I know you went out with my man, so I just need to know did you take him home and do the damn thing or not?

SABRINA	No.  He just seems like a nice guy.

MAURICE	Well, sending flowers and shit, it seems…

SABRINA	Hush up.

MAURICE	You gonna see him again?

SABRINA	As a matter of fact, I might.  Mmm.  It does say "lunch?"

MAURICE	Don't.

SABRINA	What?

MAURICE	Don't make yourself so available.

SABRINA	I'm not making myself available!  I'm not doing anything.

MAURICE	Then find something to do.  You can't be available every time he calls.

SABRINA	I'm not playing those games.

MAURICE	You can't win unless you play the game.

SABRINA	I'm not doing that.

MAURICE	Cool.  Well, be available.  He'll be gone in 2 weeks.

SABRINA	How do you know that?

MAURICE	Hmm.  I know men, Sabrina.  I am one.

SABRINA	Well…

MAURICE	What are you trying to say?

SABRINA	No.  Hold on, hold on.  Don't get offended.  Of course you're a man.

MAURICE	Oh, yeah.

SABRINA	Oh, yes, you're a man, but I mean…you were a little misleading.  Huh?  You did say that he was into you.

MAURICE	No, I still stand by that.

SABRINA	You're clearly wrong.

MAURICE	Cool.  Enjoy your 2 weeks.

SABRINA	When's the last time you had a relationship that lasted longer than 2 weeks?

MAURICE	Exactly my point.  (pops lips)

SABRINA	Go open the door.  We got a bank to run.

KAREN	Be about 30 minutes under the dryer, then you'll be right out, ok?

CUSTOMER	Yeah.

KAREN	You came early today, too, huh?

ANDI	(sighs) Hey.

KAREN	Hey, girl.  Tito, you come bring her under the dryer?  Go ahead, baby.  Go ahead.

ANDI	(chuckles) Hey.

KAREN	Girl, you look like I feel.  What's up?

ANDI	Nope.  You first.

KAREN	No.  You go ahead.

ANDI	No.  You tell me.  Gary.

KAREN	Zac.  Look, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Go on.

ANDI	No.  I…You first.

KAREN	Zac left this morning without putting up a fight, and I just…I think he's with that girl.

ANDI	Oh, damn.

KAREN	I know.

ANDI	What the hell?  Every black woman in the city can't be going through this shit.

KAREN	Can't be.

ANDI	All right, come on.  I'm hungry.

KAREN	Okay, but I'm meeting up with Danni.

ANDI	Wait.  Then we won't be able to talk about this.

KAREN	I know.  She gonna be too busy talking about my situation anyway.

ANDI	Mmm, good point.  Give me a break.

KAREN	Right.

ANDI	Well, is Bri coming?

KAREN	No, she got a date.

ANDI	With the guy from last night?

KAREN	Mm-hmm.

ANDI	Oh, he's taking her out again?

KAREN	Lunch, apparently.

ANDI	Wow.  Well, I hope she has better luck than me.  I mean us.

KAREN	No, Zac's gone.  You mean you.

ANDI	No, I mean us.

KAREN	You ready?

ANDI	Oh, you gonna change the subject?

KAREN	Are you ready?

ANDI	Yeah, I'm ready.  Can we eat?  (laughs)

KAREN	(indistinct)

CALVIN	Ha ha!

SABRINA	(laughs)

CALVIN	Are you serious?  You mean to tell me you've never come here before?

SABRINA	No.

CALVIN	Oh, what, it's too much of a dive for you?

SABRINA	No.

CALVIN	Hmm.

SABRINA	I mean, I love it.  I just can't, you know, eat like this every day.  This grown-woman weight won't fall off like it used to.

CALVIN	Girl, what are you talking about?  You look terrific.  Stop it.

SABRINA	(giggles)

CALVIN	You see that right there?

SABRINA	What?

CALVIN	Your smile is…It's like life.

SABRINA	Okay, stop.

CALVIN	No.  Your smile is what life should be.  You're beautiful.

SABRINA	Okay, Calvin.  What--what's up?  Where is your girlfriend?

CALVIN	Oh, wow!  I knew this was coming.

SABRINA	Well, you did ask me.

CALVIN	(sighs) All right.  Well, there's the door if you want to run, 'cause…

SABRINA	Nope.  I'm ready.  Go.

CALVIN	Okay.  Well, I am single because I have a kid and a baby mama that's bat-shit crazy.

SABRINA	Hmm.  Okay.  Why didn't you two make it?

CALVIN	Did you not hear the crazy part?

SABRINA	Yes, but there had to have been a time when you found her attractive, right?

CALVIN	(clicks tongue) Are we speaking honestly?

SABRINA	That's the only way I want to speak.

CALVIN	It was her body.

SABRINA	Wow.  That is so shallow.

CALVIN	No, no, no, wait.  Before you start dragging me, all right, like any other man, I saw her, thought she was sexy.

SABRINA	Where?

CALVIN	I hit her up.

SABRINA	On the 'gram?

CALVIN	Yeah.

SABRINA	(chuckles) All right, go ahead, keep going.

CALVIN	Thank you.  So, I hit her up, you know, slid in her dm.  We knew each other for, like, 2 days.  Next thing I know, she's talking about that she loves me and she wants to be with me, and it was--aghh!
SABRINA	That's scary.

CALVIN	Yeah, tell me about it.  That's not even the scary part.  We only had sex one time.  Now I got a baby boy.

SABRINA	Wow!

CALVIN	Yeah.

SABRINA	But you do it only takes one time, right?

CALVIN	Yeah.  I know.  I mean, my baby boy--he's…amazing, but…The baby mama…(chuckles)

SABRINA & CALVIN	Bat-shit crazy!

CALVIN	Right.  So you understand.

SABRINA	I got it.

CALVIN	(chuckles) It's crazy.

LAZ	Calvin?

CALVIN	Oh, my god!  Laz?

LAZ	Oh, my god!

CALVIN & LAZ	Mwah!

LAZ	It is so good to see you.

CALVIN	It's good to see you.  I can't believe it!

LAZ	This is crazy.

CALVIN	It is.  How you been?

LAZ	So good.

CALVIN	Good.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Sabrina, this is Laz.  Laz, this is Sabrina.

SABRINA	Hi!

LAZ	Hi.  Oh, my god.  My car's outside.  will you please call me?  I miss you!

CALVIN	I miss you!

LAZ	Please?  Please call me.  Please.

CALVIN	I definitely will.  Definitely, man.  You already know.

LAZ	Okay, 'cause that thing you did last time I saw you, I am still in pain!

CALVIN	Oh, my god.  I can't believe you remember…

LAZ	Of course I do.  It was good to meet you, Katrina.

SABRINA	It's Sabra…

CALVIN	Wow!  Mmm, mmm, mmm.  Good old Laz.  Ah…mmm.

SABRINA	Mm-hmm.  You have a little lip…

CALVIN	Oh.  Ha ha!

SABRINA	Mmm.  Good ol'--gotta go.  You know, I have an appointment.

CALVIN	Hmm.

SABRINA	So I think I should get out of here.

CALVIN	Okay.  Well, guess I'll just go grab the check.

SABRINA	Uh-huh.

KAREN	That's him texting you?

ANDI	No, it's Bri.

KAREN	Oh.  What she saying?

ANDI	She asks where we are and she said, "Don't Move."  She's on the way, apparently.

KAREN	Well…you better hurry up and finish this conversation before she and Danni get here.

ANDI	Girl, what am I gonna do?

KAREN	What else did she say?

ANDI	I mean some of everything.  The man she described--she said he yells at her and he belittles her and--I mean, I've never seen any of that.

KAREN	Andi, you can't take that lady's case.

ANDI	I know.  I'm just gonna go back to my job and I'm gonna tell 'em I can't do it.

KAREN	What reason will you give 'em?

ANDI	You're gonna help me think of that.

KAREN	Oh.

ANDI	Please?

KAREN	Mmm.  Um-mmm.  I don't know.  I really don't.  I don't know nothin' about love, so.

ANDI	Neither do I, apparently.

KAREN	Andi, you could lose your job.  You remember how hard you worked in law school.  You can't lose that for that man.

ANDI	Yeah.  And, girl, she hired a private detective to follow him every morning.

KAREN	When he's with you?

ANDI	They're trying to figure out why he parks in his building and waits an hour to go to workout.

KAREN	(sighs) Your building.

ANDI	Yes.

KAREN	Girl…

ANDI	The gym is across the street.

KAREN	I don't like this.  I don't like this at all.

ANDI	(sighs) Neither do I, but i have to tell my boss.  Why did she choose me?

KAREN	Girl…

ANDI	What?

KAREN	You think she knows?

ANDI	(scoffs) No.

KAREN	Wait.  What if she knows it's you and she's messing with you, Andi?

ANDI	(clicks tongue) I don't think she'll go through the trouble of doing all that just to mess with me.

KAREN	(sighs) Look…

ANDI	That's cra…

KAREN	Don't put it past her.  Just talk to your boss.

ANDI	Okay.

KAREN	Hey, girl.  Go ahead, sit down.

DANNI	Hey.

KAREN	How you doing?

DANNI	Hey.

ANDI	How are you?

DANNI	I'm sorry.  I just…

KAREN	For what?

DANNI	Well, what he do now?

KAREN	Girl, I just wanted to take you to lunch.  Stop!

DANNI	What did I do?

KAREN	Nothing!

DANNI	You two never call me for lunch.

KAREN	(sighs) Well, I wanted to.  So…

DANNI	Oh, okay.  Uh…yeah, so I did charge my amazon bill to your account, but you know I'm gonna pay you back, Karen.  Gotta bring me here, shake me down.

KAREN	I didn't know you did that, Danni.

DANNI	Forget I said that until the 1st.

KAREN	I just wanted to bring you to lunch.  That's it, so…

DANNI	Oh, shit.  Who died?

KAREN	Oh, my god.

DANNI	What did you do?

ANDI	Come on.  Nobody died.  Okay?

KAREN	I just wanted to talk to you.  That's all.

DANNI	Okay.

KAREN	Zac said some things, and I just wanted to get your opinion on it.  That's all.

DANNI	You know what, I'm just--I'm not hooking anyone else up.  You know, um…I should just whoop his ass.  (laughs) What did he do now?  Can I get a drink, please?

KAREN	Girl, you about to go back to work.  What are you talking about?

DANNI	Right?  Exactly.  It'll help me from killing the bitch.  (chuckles) I need peach vodka.

KAREN	That's what he did.

DANNI	No.  Doesn't sound right.

KAREN	I know!  Am I being crazy?

ANDI	Yes.

DANNI	No.  He got up and left without a fight?

KAREN	Right.

DANNI	He with that ho.

ANDI	Okay, see, you…

KAREN	You think so?

ANDI	You two--you don't need to talk to each other.  You make each other crazy.

DANNI	No, Karen, you right.  He with that ho!

KAREN	You think so, right?

DANNI	Yeah!  She probably called him this morning and told him he can come stay with her.

KAREN	That's what I said, Andi!

ANDI	Don't do this, Karen.

DANNI	I promise you, I can find out.

KAREN	Thank you, girl.

DANNI	I will.

KAREN	That's all.

ANDI	No.

KAREN	I just want to know.

DANNI	I got you.

ANDI	Hey, girl.  You're late.  We gotta go back to work.

SABRINA	He kissed a man.

ANDI	Oh, we gotta talk.

DANNI	What are you talking about?

SABRINA	Well…(clicks tongue) we were sitting in there…

KAREN	Uh-hmm.

DANNI	Hmm.

SABRINA	…and then this guy comes in.  And I mean, that bitch was…(snaps fingers) beat.

KAREN	Oh…

ANDI	Oh…

SABRINA	(sighs) He had the heels and the head wrap, but a full beard.  And the eyebrows were arched.

DANNI	Yasss, honey.

ANDI	Stop it.

KAREN	You talkin' about the man that you met last night?

ANDI	Calvin.

SABRINA	Yes.

KAREN	Okay.

SABRINA	I mean, then the guy, you know, he comes up and they greet and they say hi, and then they hug…really, really tight.  And then the guy says…"the last time I saw you, you were in so much pain."

ANDI	(gasps) Oh…

KAREN	(gasps) Oh…

DANNI	Oh.

SABRINA	What are you doing?

DANNI	I'm seeing how much room I got to fall out!


ANDI	Stop it, Danni!

DANNI	(laughs)

ANDI	This is not funny.

DANNI	Sorry, sorry.  (clears throat) (sniffles)

KAREN	Danni, stop.

DANNI	I'm not…

KAREN	Stop.  Okay?  Go ahead.  Go ahead, 'Brina.  I'm listening.  Danni!

ANDI	Okay.  Did he introduce you?

SABRINA	Yes.

ANDI	Good.  Did he say who he was?

SABRINA	He didn't say a damn thing.

ANDI	Maybe because there's nothing to tell.

KAREN	Maybe.

DANNI	Or he's been getting that tail and pinning the dick on the donkey.

KAREN	(chuckles) Danni.

SABRINA	Of course.  Of course.  Why do I even tell you anything?

KAREN	You know that's why you confide.

SABRINA	Oh, I'm not talking to him no more.

ANDI	Wait a minute, 'Brina.  Why don't you just ask him?

DANNI	No, look, look.  This is what you do.  You take him home, you pull out your vibrator.  When he sees you, you know, you let him go up in there with it.

ANDI	Um, could we not do this at lunch?

DANNI	Oh, don't act like you wasn't…Gary last night, the man you claim you gonna be leaving.

ANDI	(clears throat)

SABRINA	Did you break it off?

ANDI	It's a very nice place, actually.

KAREN	Yeah.

SABRINA	Did you break it off?

ANDI	(clicks tongue) Um…no.

DANNI	The dick…

ANDI	But I will.  I will…soon.

DANNI	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That d too good.  And he's fine as hell.

ANDI	That's true.

DANNI	Dark-skinned brother have you feenin'…

ANDI	Also true.

SABRINA	Wait a minute.

DANNI	What?

SABRINA	You really called her about that?

ANDI	Oh.

KAREN	Oh, no.  No.  No.

SABRINA	And you're really gonna listen to her?  You know she's always going off the deep end.

KAREN	True.

DANNI	That's where the truth is.

KAREN	Sometimes.

SABRINA	Like that time when…what's his name?

KAREN & ANDI	Craig.

KAREN	It's Craig.

SABRIN	A Craig--he was--yeah, you thought he was cheating on you, but you actually chased his mama down.

ANDI	Girl, you broke that woman's hip.  (sighs)

DANNI	I shoulda.  Nobody told that old bitch to be in red bottoms.  She looked young from the back!

ANDI	She's 70.

DANNI	She was still smaller than me with them brittle-ass bones.

ANDI	You're lucky you didn't get sued.

DANNI	Hmm.  I didn't know the bitch had osteoporosis.  I contributed to the fund afterwards.

KAREN	(chuckles)

ANDI	(sighs)

SABRINA	Okay.  All I can say, don't listen to her.  Just making my point.

ANDI	Good point.

KAREN	It's over.  You good.

DANNI	Thank you.  'Cause I'm telling the truth, all right.  Listen, I'll show you.  Come to my house tonight.  We'll go through the 'gram…

KAREN	Okay.

ANDI	No.

DANNI	And I'll put it all together for you.

KAREN	Yes!

DANNI	For a small fee.

SABRINA	Don't do it.  Bring wine and weed.  But I gots to go.

KAREN	Yeah, listen, call me when he calls you.

SABRINA	Did y'all pay the bill?

KAREN	No.  You got it, right?

SABRINA	Yup.

ANDI	Oh.  I'm trapped!  Help me!

KAREN	Help yourself!

ANDI	Aah!  Bye!

SABRINA	Those aren't my friends.

MAURICE	You're late.

SABRINA	I'm sorry.

MAURICE	You know I cannot leave until you come back.

SABRINA	I know.  I said I'm sorry.

MAURICE	So how was lunch?

SABRINA	Good.

MAURICE	What was he wearing?

SABRINA	Jeans.

MAURICE	(chuckles) Did he smell good, girl?

SABRINA	Okay.  Where is your head at?

MAURICE	Nowhere.  It's just I look book, chapter, and verse.

SABRINA	Don't you have to go to lunch?

MAURICE	Oh, girl, I can eat and talk.

SABRINA	Great.

MAURICE	(chuckles) Tell me, girl.

SABRINA	Okay.  Can I ask you something?

MAURICE	Oh, this fella be good, huh.

SABRINA	Never mind.

MAURICE	Don't do that.  Come on.  What did he do?  Tell extravaganza!

SABRINA	Who's extravaganza?

MAURICE	That's my drag name.

SABRINA	Hmm.  That's cute.

MAURICE	What did he do?

SABRINA	Is it wrong for me to assume that a man's gay because he has gay friends?

MAURICE	Oh, yeah, that's ignorant as shit.

SABRINA	(sighs) You're right.

MAURICE	What kind of gay friend?

SABRINA	What do you mean?

MAURICE	]You know, the l, the g, the b, the t, the q, the i, or the a?

SABRINA	Why does that matter?

MAURICE	Well, it doesn't matter.  If the friend's a les, but…

SABRINA	Well, I mean, there was this guy who came into the restaurant.

MAURICE	Uh-hmm.

SABRINA	You know, his name is Laz.

MAURICE	Now, was his name Laz or was his name lazz!

SABRINA	Maurice.  (sighs heavily) Anyway…

MAURICE	Mm-hmm.

SABRINA	They greeted each other and they hugged and then they kissed.

MAURICE	Wait, wait, wait.  Where he kiss the man?

SABRINA	On the lips.

MAURICE	Aw, yeah, girl.  He just as gay as my unicorn picnic basket.  Okay, nothing wrong with that, but it's true.

SABRINA	Come on, will you talk to me?

MAURICE	(sighs) Do you like him?

SABRINA	No.

MAURICE	Yes, you do.  Because if you didn't, you wouldn't be bothered.

SABRINA	I mean, he just seems like a really nice guy.  I was just thrown off by that.

MAURICE	Just ask him.

SABRINA	I already did.  He told me he was straight.

MAURICE	Straight-straight or straight with a twist?

SABRINA	Can't you just find out if he is and, like, you know, ask around or something?

MAURICE	Absolutely.  How about I just hop on the queen's hotline and see if anybody knows him 'cause all of us gays know each other!

SABRINA	You know what, you're just being silly.  I don't want to talk to you.

MAURICE	Just ask the man, okay?

SABRINA	You suck.

MAURICE	And you better hope your man don't swallow.  Okay?  (laughs)

SABRINA	Such an asshole.

MAURICE	Oh-ho!  That too!  (laughs)

SABRINA	Get back to work.  Next, please!  Hi, how are you?

DON	I'm about to leave.  How did it go?

ANDI	I need to talk to you, sir.

DON	Okay.  Sounds serious.

ANDI	Yes, it is.

DON	I think I know what this is about.

ANDI	You do?

DON	Yeah.  I was looking over the salary offer we made you, and it's really low and unfair.  I think we should bump it about 11%.  That'll put you right on par with Nelson, our other recruit.

ANDI	Well, I appreciate that…

DON	And he did go to Harvard, you know.

ANDI	Yes, but I also…


DON	Listen, I don't want to get into negotiating with you.  You're a hell of a negotiator, and I know you have other offers.  And if you don't, you will.  I just want to make sure you're happy here.

ANDI	I can't represent Jasmine borders.

DON	Why?

ANDI	Because there is a clear conflict of interest.

DON	How conflicted?

ANDI	It's extreme.

DON	That's really disappointing.  I'm sorry, too, because I think I'm gonna have to hold off on that salary offer.  I don't think you understand, but Helen, who recommended her, is the head of the Rhinehouse, the elite women of this town.  They meet every Wednesday to talk about school, kids, whatever their husbands are doing.  Morris and Winston had them for years and made millions, and you brought them to us.

ANDI	I can still do my job.

DON	Not if you turn tail on your best friend.

ANDI	But the conflict is gonna…

DON	I think you need to think long and hard about this conflict and be sure that it is a conflict.

ANDI	I know her husband.

DON	How?  (chuckles) I see.

ANDI	I'm sorry.

DON	You should go home.

ANDI	Are you firing me?

DON	No.  Hell, no.  (chuckles) But you should go home.  And I want you to think about what I said.  Think about that conflict.  And is it really a conflict?  Attorney barns?  We never had this conversation.

DANNI	Hey, baggage, you good?  Be right back.  Hey!

ZAC	God!  Come on, Danni!  Every day?

DANNI	No, sir.

ZAC	(groans)

DANNI	Get your ass off this cart and come talk to me right now.

ZAC	I got to get these old ladies.  Danni…dan…

DANNI	Tell them old bitches it broke down.

ZAC	Danni, you messin' with my tip money.

DANNI	What are you doing?

ZAC	Give me my key.

DANNI	Hold on.  There it is.  Almost--oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

ZAC	Really?

DANNI	Take it.

ZAC	Girl, I will take it.

DANNI	You know, you're messin' over my friend, right?  She's a good woman.

ZAC	I know that, Danni.  I know it.

DANNI	Then why did you leave?

ZAC	She told me to leave.

DANNI	She didn't mean that…

ZAC	You see this right here?  This right here is what's wrong with you.  That's why you're all single.

DANNI	Uh-hmm.

ZAC	Yes, 'cause y'all crazy.

DANNI	I'll slap the shit out you.

ZAC	Go ahead on with that, Danni.

DANNI	My girl has been there for you.

ZAC	I know that.  She never let me forget it.

DANNI	(clicks tongue) Aw.  What are you talking about?

ZAC	She always on my shit, all right, just because I can't pay a bill or I need to borrow the car.  Like, nobody want to hear that every day.  I'm a grown-ass man.  (sighs)

DANNI	Well, get a better job.

ZAC	With my record?  I'm happy as hell to have this one.

DANNI	So because you're in your feelings, you're gonna let the best thing that ever happened to you just pass you right by?

ZAC	You…

DANNI	See that?  That's--that's Karen.

ZAC	You don't get it.

DANNI	Tell me.

ZAC	(sighs) Danni, I'm trying.

DANNI	Okay.  You know I'm on your side.

ZAC	You're on my side?

DANNI	Yes.

ZAC	So then give me my key back so I can go make some more money.

DANNI	Where are you staying?

ZAC	(sighs) You know I'll take that key, right?

DANNI	Do it.  Boy, don't do that!  I'll…you right here on this carpet like a rabbit.  Do you want that?

ZAC	Give me it!

DANNI	In front of these people?

ZAC	I don't know them, but give me the damn key.

DANNI	(clicks tongue) That's not it.  No.  Actually, come on.  Help me out.

ZAC	Danni!

DANNI	See?  See?

ZAC	Are you kidding me?

DANNI	You were gonna do it, weren't you?  It feels good.  Whoo!  (sighs) Was good to myself.  You ain't shit.

ZAC	Thank you.  You just like your friend.  She reminds me every day.  Why these keys so sweaty?

DANNI	I got a warm bosom.

ZAC	They'll short-circuit the cart.  Cart coming through!

ZAC	Cart coming through!  Yo, khakis, I said "cart coming through," bro.  You ain't even paying attention.

WOMAN	Excuse me.

AARON	It ain't all it's cracked up to be.

KAREN	Excuse me?

AARON	Marriage.  Trust me.

KAREN	Oh.  Okay.

AARON	Uh, Aaron carter.

KAREN	Karen.

AARON	How are you?

KAREN	Tired.  Excuse me.

AARON	You see that right there, that attitude, is why you're single.

KAREN	Oh!  First of all, you asshole, I'm not single.  And second of all, watch who the hell you're talking to.

AARON	You do the same with your rude ass.

KAREN	Rude.  Me?

AARON	Yeah.  I'm just saying hi to you.  You can't even say hi back?

KAREN	Whatever.  Okay?  (scoffs)

AARON	See?  That's why I date white women.  You try and give a sister a chance, they got attitude about every damn thing.

KAREN	(chuckles) Oh, wait a minute.  A chance?  What chance?  You ain't never had a chance even when you walked up here.  Okay, so, yes, yes.  Some of us do have an attitude 'cause we are tired of playing weak so sorry-ass…like you could feel strong…

AARON	Now, hold on…

KAREN	No, no, no, no.  Okay?  We are tired of dumbing ourselves down so that your ego can be inflated.  Tired of playing your mama, your daddy, and your damn therapist when all we really want to do is just be.  Hmm?  Be us, be women.  So get the…out of here with that shit, okay?  That way.  Bye…

WOMAN	…with your tired ass.

WOMAN	Next time, bring popcorn.

GARY	Hey, babe.  Been calling you all day.  I just called into Albuquerque, last-minute things.  So I can't see you tomorrow morning.  I love you.  Hope you're kicking ass today.

AARON	(clicks tongue) Hey.

KAREN	Leave me alone.

AARON	Please?

KAREN	You want to get cussed out again?

AARON	I just want to apologize.

KAREN	Okay, good.  Now you can be gone.

AARON	Come on, look.  I'm going through some things, too, all right?  I just found out my wife is screwing around on me.  I'm mad.  I came out here.  I saw you, and I ended up taking it out on you when it's really all my stuff, so I apologize.

KAREN	Was she white?

AARON	I don't know why race really has to come into it.

KAREN	Oh, she was white.

AARON	Look…I got some ice cream, too.  Do you want some company?

KAREN	I don't know you.  (chuckles)

AARON	I mean, you cussed me out like you did.

KAREN	Can you leave me alone, please?

AARON	(clicks tongue) All right.  Well, you got the right idea, so…I'll be over sitting in my truck going into a sugar coma, too.

KAREN	Do that.

AARON	Yeah.

KAREN	Wait, um…kind you got?

AARON	Vanilla?

KAREN	Thanks.

AARON	Really?

KAREN	Get in.

AARON	(chuckles) (sighs) Can we start over?  I'm Aaron.

KAREN	Karen.

AARON	It's nice to meet you, Karen.

KAREN	You, too.  Thanks for the ice cream.

DANNI	Oh, my feet are killing me.  What the…

ANDI	Next on "Sistas"…

CALVIN	Have a seat.

MAURICE	I'm honored to be invited.

CALVIN	What are you having?

MAURICE	Anything black.

KAREN	I'm just mad at every man in the world today.  I wish I could just shoot fire from my boobs and burn 'em all off the planet.

AARON	Damn, that's harsh.

KAREN	You not gonna ask for my number?

JASMIN	I am not gonna let some horrible, miserable wicked person without a soul destroy my marriage.  Anyone who sleeps with another person's husband is clearly the devil.

ANDI	(crying) I am tired of your bullshit!

GARY	Baby…

ANDI	No, get out!

GARY	Baby, please.

ANDI	Get out!
