EVA	What are you doing here?

JASON	I wanted to see you.

EVA	Well, you've seen me. Now go.

MILES	Strip.

ALL	(chanting) Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip! Strip!

SYDNEY	Another round. Let's go.

TERESA	Something's wrong. She's not moving.

E.J.	That's the new president's daughter, man.

EVA	She was dangerously close to alcohol poisoning.

OFFICER	Cedric Hobbs?

CEDRIC	What the hell y'all want?

OFFICER	You're under arrest for the murder of Chantel Brussard.

CECIL	I don't answer to you and I never will.

EVA	You do as I asked you or I will not hesitate to put my foot directly in your ass.

CEDRIC	My girl was killed. And I can't even feel how I need to feel because I'm in here and now you about to tell me you not gonna help me?

CHARLES	You are not my son. You understand?

CARLTON	They'll call me to clean up Black Ivy's mess when she fails. So I have to make sure she fails.

BERETTA	Son, you just got something kids who look like you don't get: a second chance.

CECIL	The hell was that?

NONI	I'll get it next time.

CECIL	There'll be no next time. (coughs)

WOMAN	Good evening, Mr. Diamond. Come on in.

CECIL	Good evening.

WOMAN	Welcome. We're so glad to have you. Come on in.

DANNY	All right.

WOMAN	Yes.

DANNY	Come on, Drum.

WOMAN	Thank you.

DANNY	You guys know the drill. Let's go ahead and get everything set up in the back. Just push it all the way back. We don't want the piano too close. Yeah, can one of you guys go back and grab the guitar? Come on, come on, come on. Set up over there.

NONI	'Kay. I'll put his down and get the rest of the stuff. Excuse me.

CECIL	You tell her about the dolly in the bandroom?

DANNY	She didn't ask.

CECIL	(laughs) Man...

WOMAN (singing)	Do you wanna go? Tell me you can go. Is it possible for a while or so? We can just spend some time together. Then he said, "I was thinking so, baby, we can go. It is possible anytime you want. We can go spend some time together. I can't think..."JUNIOR AND TERRENCE AND TAVARUS	To the mighty mountain cats.

EVA	Thank you so much for coming out. I can find a donor who cares as much about their safety as I do and that is my one and only goal tonight.

JUNIOR	Dr. Tyson, if we don't recondition that field...

TERRENCE	Someone's gonna step in a hole.

TAVARUS	Or break a leg.

EVA	And the locker room mold?

TAVARUS	Oh, good God.

TERRENCE	It's bad.

JUNIOR	Awful.

TERRENCE	Running drills on that filed? Hostile.

WOMAN	Thank you.

WOMAN	Mm-hmm, you're right.

EVA	My one and only goal tonight is to find the donor who'll fund an endowed chair in your name.

MADISON	Hey, babe. Where are you? I'm starting to get worried. Call me back, okay? Love you. (sighs)

EVA	Thank you.

MAN	Thank you.

EVA	Enjoy yourself.

WOMAN (singing)	Then he said, "I was thinking so, baby, we can go. It is possible anytime you want we can go spend some time together."

CECIL	Come on, let me hear it.

JAZZ SINGER	Thank you.

CECIL	Here it is. Right here, y'all.

CECIL	Boys.

BASSIST	Thank you. Thanks.

CECIL	Keep it up.

TAVARUS	Ahh. The sweet taste of victory.


JUNIOR	It's beautiful. One more game.

TERRENCE	One more game?

JUNIOR	Beat four in a row.

TERRENCE	Gotta love 'em.

EVA	My one and only goal this evening is to show folks like yourself--people who wanna make a difference, why you should invest in this school. 'Cause the thing is, we are about to have a phenomenal semester. Our band is fantastic, our football team is on the way up.

WOMAN	Hey, girl.

SIMONE	How are you?

JASON	Hello, there.

SIMONE	Jason.

EVA	Excuse me...

WOMAN	Sure.

EVA	One second.



EVA	No, I will not remove the lobster puffs from the menu. That is called an investment. Mm-hmm. Could you repeat that? Of course the valet is necessary. It's about appearances. No, we can go over the particulars when I get in which should be any minute now. Good-bye, Crystal. You...are a distraction.

JASON	(groans) I know you got a party to plan.

EVA	It's a capital fund kickoff. More work than party.

JASON	So what time should I be there?

EVA	Be where?

JASON	(laughs) I'm kidding.

EVA	I know you are, but don't. I have to charm my way into the pockets of Georgia's one percenters and if you're there--

JASON	I know, I get it. Discretion is the better part of valor and all that.

EVA	Mm-hmm. And all that.

EVA	Simone.

SIMONE	Hi, Eva, how are you?

EVA	Better now that you're here. My apologies about lunch.

SIMONE	Oh, no worries at all. We'll try again next week.

EVA	Yes, we will.

JASON	Hello. Jason King.

SIMONE	Oh, I'm sorry. Jason is my new T.A.

EVA	Nice to meet you, Jason.

JASON	Oh, the pleasure's all mine, ma'am.

EVA	Ma'am. (chuckles) At some point, I'll get used to being surrounded by all these Southern gentlemen.

SIMONE	Jason's actually a new transfer from your old school.

EVA	From Laura Farnsworth? You're kidding. What're you studying?

JASON	Community Psychology. First year of the PhD program.

SIMONE	Jason's has been doing some very interesting work about the culture of unrest in black communities.

JASON	Since Dr. Jackson here is one of the most respected scholars in the field, decided I would transfer here.

EVA	Actually, you know who you must meet is Dr. Elmore Bailey. He runs the Psychological Testing Center at Atlanta Presbyterian and he'shere.

SIMONE	I was just telling him about Dr. Elmore's work. Go.

EVA	We'll be right back.

MAN	What's up?

WOMAN	Nothing.

MAN	Okay, you good. Enjoy.

MAN	How we doing?

MAN	Okay, fine. Yeah, we got--

CAMPUS COP 1	Whoa, whoa, whoa. How can I help you, my man?

CEDRIC	Cedric Hobbs.

CAMPUS COP 1	I don't see your name on the list. You got an invitation?

CEDRIC	Nah, I didn't know you needed one. I'm a guest of Dr. Fletcher, though.

CAMPUS COP 2	There his name is right there.

CEDRIC	Thanks, bro.

CAMPUS COP 1	Man, I saw his damn name.

CAMPUS COP 2	I know you did. Why do you think I said something?

CAMPUS COP 1	Get outta here with that shit. If one of us would've been grabbed up for murdering some chick, cops would've called it a gang related hit, multiplied the strikes, and thrown us up under the jail. But ole college boy? Back and partying with the prez in less than a month. (scoffs)

CAMPUS COP 2	I gonna go get some more coffee.

CAMPUS COP 1	You do that.

EVA	What the hell are you doing here?

JASON	Well, my dissertation chair invited me.

EVA	Leave now.

JASON	Okay, first of all, watch your tone...or my tongue might find its way to one of your nipples right here.

EVA	I don't know what game you're playing, but I can't. Not tonight.


JASON	Well, that's unfortunate because tonight's exactly when I want to play.

SYDNEY	(sighs) There you are.

EVA	Hey. Yes, what is it, sweetie?

SYDNEY	That really weird party planner you hired is looking for you.

EVA	Okay, thank you.

SYDNEY	Wait, aren't you gonna introduce us?

EVA	(chuckles) Sydney, I know this young man is very handsome, but be a little discreet. You're embarrassing him.

JASON	I like it when a woman's willing to be transparent.

SYDNEY	Hm.

JASON	Jason.

SYDNEY	Sydney.

EVA	My daughter.

JASON	Your daughter?

EVA	Yes, my one and only.

SYDNEY	Mom. Go.

SYDNEY	Drink?

JASON	Uh, sure.

EVA	And this right here? We can't do that anymore. Thank you.

SYDNEY	Something wrong?

EVA	Oh, everything's fine. Like you said, I just hired a weird party planner.

SYDNEY	Jason's a grad student here, mother.

EVA	Yes, I know. He's a guest of Simone's. We should be polite and let him go back to her.

JASON	No, it's okay.

EVA	No, it isn't. It's quite rude, in fact.

SYDNEY	Waste of time arguing with her, Jason. She needs to win. May I use your cell phone before I go?

JASON	Yeah, sure.

SYDNEY	You just called me.

SYDNEY	I'll hit you back tomorrow.

EVA	Were you just flirting with my daughter?

JASON	Oh, come on. You know I'm into older women. Five minutes. Your bedroom.

CEDRIC	It's open.

EVA	Hi, Cedric. Did I wake you?

CEDRIC	No, come in.

EVA	Do you mind if I open these blinds?

CEDRIC	Go ahead. Sorry I wasn't expecting nobody.

EVA	It's fine. I, um--I'm wondering if you might help me with something.

CEDRIC	Chiraq Most highbrow individuals hate that name. But until you've seen a body slain, blown brains, toddlers used as shields on this concrete battlefield...

EVA	You recognize that guy?

CEDRIC	For me? I'm gonna call a spade a spade...

EVA	You submitted this as your personal statement when you applied here.

CEDRIC	It's not your kid, it's not your problem. You turn your face. We lost--

EVA	If you happen to run into him, let him know I'd like him to perform this piece at a cocktail party I'm throwing. My guest speaker flaked on me, so I thought, "Who can I call last minute?"

CEDRIC	And all you could come up with was me?

EVA	Cedric, I'm not gonna pretend I know what you're going through.

CEDRIC	And no disrespect, but I really can't hear, "She's in a better place. She wouldn't want you to be sad. She gonna always be with you." You know, pardon me, but that's bullshit. And I really can't listen to that right now.

EVA	I think you should feel whatever you need to feel. Whatever you wish you'd done differently, any mistakes you want to take back, things you never said, but should've.

CEDRIC	Exactly. I got a lot on my mind right now.

EVA	And if you come to this party, it's not gonna change how you feel.

EVA	But it's not a bad thing to do something you love to do despite how you feel. Think about it.

EVA	I don't need to know today.

SERVER	Canapé?

CEDRIC	I'm good.

EVA	No, don't even think about touching me.


JASON	Okay. I don't understand.

EVA	oh, please. Unlike everyone else at this party, I'm not charmed by you. What the hell are you doing here?

JASON	Oh, you're not charmed? Well, why don't you give me a second to change that?

EVA	I don't know if you've noticed, but I am hosting a party downstairs.

JASON	I'm about to host a party downstairs, too.

EVA	Just stop. You think it's funny flirting with my daughter? And you show up somewhere when I asked you not to? I have to assume that you don't have my best interest at heart.

JASON	I'm not trying to hurt you, Eva.

EVA	Then don't! Do--

CECIL	Hey, that's enough from me. That's enough from me. This evening belongs to some of the most talented-- the most talented student musicians in the land.

CECIL	Come back to the mic, Lattea. Yeah. Come on. (inhales sharply)

BOY	One, two, three, four.

PHOTOGRAPHER	Look this way, Mr. Diamond.

CECIL	No, no, no, no. Thank you.

WOMAN	Sir?

SERENA	(laughs) I'm crazy about you. You know that, right?

CECIL	And you know I'm crazy about you. You know that? (inhales sharply) Aah, sh--

SERENA	What? Wait. Your back?

CECIL	Uh-huh.

SERENA	Come on, easy. Easy. Roll over here. I got you.

CECIL	Aah...(exhales deeply)

SERENA	Did you get a second opinion?

CECIL	Yup, about a week ago.

SERENA	You mind sharing?

CECIL	He agreed with Dr. Yao. Lung cancer. Non-small cell. "Lots of treatments. People are living longer. We'll try to get you in a study right away." Blah, blah, blah.

SERENA	You know I'm here for you, right? Whatever you need.

CECIL	You know, I never smoked a day in my life. Doctors running all kinds of tests, taking blood, asking all kinds of ridiculous questions about my family history. all they need to know is I ain't got time for this shit. The Mountain Cat Jazz Quartet is playing this silly party and I need to get in one more rehearsal. That's all I got time to think about. (laughs) You think I'm deflecting.

SERENA	Aren't you?

CECIL	I visited my sister. Somehow I wanted to tell her, but...(exhales sharply) I guess ten years of nothing between us was too much.

SERENA	I should go. 

SERENA	Same time next week?

CECIL	Come here. (sighs) All right. (chuckles)

MAN	Good evening.

CAMPUS COP 1	Last name, sir?

MAN	Uh, Dixon.

EVA	Bryce, I see you've met Dr. Higginbottem.

BRYCE	Founder of Black Skye Oil needs no introduction.

REGINALD	(laughs) Neither does Judge Richardson's son, right? Bryce was just telling me that he's on the debate team.

BRYCE	Like my brother before me.

REGINALD	Is that right?

BRYCE	In fact, Dr. Fletcher's daughter and I are in the same class. I had to debate her just yesterday.

REGINALD	Well, I bet you gave her a whupping.

REGINALD	Am I right?

BRYCE	Sent her home crying.

BRYCE	...in one year, 194 black men have been murdered by law enforcement. It's open season. Officers must adopt mandatory de-escalation procedures.

SYDNEY	A black man has to recognize the risks involved when he steps outside. There'd be no need for de-escalation by police if black men took that responsibility on themselves.

BRYCE	With all due respect, Miss Fletcher, that is a ridiculous infringement on my right to be. You have no idea what it's like to be a black man.

SYDNEY	(laughs) With all due respect, Mr. Richardson, you are not all black men. In fact, you're not most black men.

BRYCE	Surely, you're not suggesting that my background--which is much the same as yours, makes me less black?

SYDNEY	I'm merely debating the argument I was given. I know that black men are systematically discriminated against. Killed for holding a phone. Killed if they don't resist. Therefore, de-escalation only works if there are severe consequences for people who pull the trigger and their commanders. That's the point you should've made, but you went personal instead of presenting what would have been a more salient point.

REGINALD	As a matter of fact, I was in the same situation myself and I have sent several young ladies home crying. (laughs)

MAN	Damn, y'all act like he killed somebody.

MAN	He not even wearing a suit.

OFFICER	You're under arrest for the murder of Chantel Brussard.

SERVER	Cucumber hummus?

CEDRIC	There's nothing for me here. Ma, there's nothing but bad memories here.

EVA	Uh, no.

PHOTOGRAPHER	Oh, okay.

CEDRIC	You need a hand with that?

NONI	Oh, no. No, it's okay. I got it.

CEDRIC	Yeah, I see that. But you'd actually be doing me a favor if you let me at least pretend to help out.


NONI	Okay.

CEDRIC	GAMU can afford equipment like this?


NONI	(chuckles) The marching band can. I haven't seen you in a while.

CEDRIC	Had stuff going on.

NONI	Yeah, I heard. I'm really sorry for your loss.

CEDRIC	Thanks. I saw you practicing the other day.

CEDRIC	Just doing your thing.

NONI	I'm alright.


CEDRIC	You talk to Ebonie lately?

NONI	I-I've been meaning to reach out, I-I've just been so busy. You?

CEDRIC	Yeah, she's, uh--she's good. I might take a road trip, go check on her. Let me know if you wanna roll.

DANNY	Freshman, while you're standing over here running your damn mouth, the whole quartet's dry as hell.

CEDRIC	Hey, bro.

DANNY	Make it happen.

NONI	I'll take care of it.

DANNY	Freshman. Can't even enjoy our break because of her lame ass.

CEDRIC	For real?

NONI	For now.


TAVARUS	Shorty said she wanna take a picture with us.

JUNIOR	I'm about that. Launch your attack.

TAVARUS	I don't need no more trouble.

NONI	You're popular.

TERRENCE	It's a gift and a curse.

NONI	I don't know why people are hating on the football team. I mean, without you guys, we'd be marching to empty stadiums.

TERRENCE	You a fan?

NONI	I am. I'm in the band. I'm thinking about quitting, though. There's just too much negativity.

TERRENCE	Is that right?

NONI	(scoffs) God, yes. "The football team ain't shit. Winning those games was pure luck. Football team ain't nothing but pussies."

TERRENCE	So the whole band's talking shit?

NONI	They do whatever Danny does.

TERRENCE	Who?

NONI	The drum major.

DANNY	What's up, man?

EVA	This lovely, young lady here is Madison Kelly. She just so happens to be my daughter's roommate. Madison is an Engineering major. She had a 4.3 GPA in high school and was a National Merit Scholar. She chose a full scholarship here over other academic suitors.


MAN	Great.


EVA	Now I think excellence at this level attracts more academic standouts. The ones who used to choose us first.

MAE	What about you, Miss Madison? Did you choose Georgia A&M first?

MADISON	Uh, yes.

MAE	Was that before or after you were offered a full scholarship?

MADISON	To be honest, ma'am, if I didn't get the scholarship I wouldn't be here. Not sure I'd be anywhere.

MAE	A National Merit Scholar with a 4.3?

MADISON	Believe it or not, that doesn't make me unique.

MAE	That makes you unique here, doesn't it?

EVA	Madison, thank you for spending so much time with us. Why don't you go get yourself something to eat and enjoy the rest of the evening?

MADISON	Thank you, Dr. Fletcher. My stomach was starting to talk to me. Nice meeting you, Ms. Brown.

MAE	You as well.

EVA	You seem to have something on your mind, Mae.

MAE	Why, I guess I do. When I was a student here, I was broke. Never even bought a book. I had to use the ones on reserve in the library. But I made it work. I graduated near the top of my class. So as Atlanta Southern Bank's VP of community outreach, it is my job to help them decide where their money can do the most good to serve the communities that we're in. And I'm not gonna lie to you. It is hard for me to recommend that we support you when that money might go to giving Miss Madison a full ride.

EVA	Well, maybe we can sit down and talk and figure out how to recruit more Mae Browns.

MAE	Maybe you can figure that out on your own. Because we're out there. You just have to be committed to finding us.

EVA	I will call you next week.

MAE	I'll look forward to hearing from you. Gotta get going. Nice party.

EVA	Thank you. Thank you.

MADISON	Ryan, where are you? Party's almost over.

DANNY	Gotta keep it swinging. Gotta keep it swinging.

NONI	Water?

DANNY	You see us over here sweating like crazy, next time make sure the waters are cold.

NONI	Got it. Um, by the way, I noticed that the frequency on your mic was set to 300, so I reset it to 450.

DANNY	I thought I noticed a cleaner sound from the monitor.

NONI	Yeah, your "Stormy Weather" solo sounded amazing.

DANNY	(chuckles) Thanks, freshman.

NONI	Look at those guys. I mean, they win a couple of games and think they're the Falcons.

DANNY	Who cares? They so used to losing, they can't help but overreact to a couple of lucky wins.

NONI	Still, I mean, you'd think they'd give you a little bit more respect. But whatever. I--

DANNY	Nah, freshman, you done already opened your mouth. Spill it.

NONI	Called us geeks with rhythm. I was trying not to listen, but one of them said if a dude was willing to put an instrument in his mouth, no telling what else he'll put in it.

DANNY	Oh, really?

NONI	That's when I got pissed. Oh, lobster puff? Thank you. There you go.


CEDRIC	(sighs)

FLIP	So that's Black Ivy.

CARLTON	In the flesh.

FLIP	What happened to your plan to force her out?

CARLTON	Died on the vine. Football team started winning, the marching band has been invited to play at the inauguration--turned it down, but still. Google scholars took second place at the Southeast coding challenge.

FLIP	And suddenly nobody cared about a couple of girls swapping spit at a frat party.

CARLTON	Mm. Even Cecil don't care no more. Told me he's got a plan of his own. So tired of this shit.

FLIP	(snorts) Good luck.

CARLTON	Yeah. Yeah. (slurps)

MAN	I think this belongs to you. Why don't you use my favorite ink pen?


MAN	Chop, chop, gentlemen, or we'll be drinking warm champagne.

MAN	(chuckles)

CARLTON	(chuckles) Okay. (chuckles) (sighs) I am sorry, gentlemen. It appears I wasted a fair amount of your good and valuable time. It was not my intention to do so. I truly thought I was ready to leave Georgia A&M. I thought my work there was done. Maybe it is, but I'm not done. I've got two degrees from that school, and even when I left to pursue my PhD, I returned the very fall after I completed it. I would have taken any job they offered me. (chuckles) I still bleed burgundy and black. I still believe my alma mater is where excellence is made. Again, my apologies for any inconvenience I may have caused. Thank you.

EVA	Again, thank you for coming out this evening. I wanted to get a group together who have it in their hearts to give and know excellence when they see it. Now, I'd like to think that I'm such a person, one who can spot genius. (laughs) And a the young man that's coming to the mic proves that Georgia A&M University recognizes the gifted in both academia and the arts. Ladies and gentlemen, one of our university's best and brightest, Cedric Hobbs.

CEDRIC	(sighs) Chiraq. Most highbrow individuals hate that name. But until you've seen a body slain, blown brains, toddlers used as shields on this concrete battlefield, you probably won't get it. But me, I'ma call a spade a spade. Check the death rates. Most as one race, but since it's not your kid, it's not your-- So since it's not your kid, it's not--

CHARLES	I don't know anything about this. The Richardsons are blue bloods. One way or another, you would end up right where you are.

CEDRIC	But y'all don't hear me. Check.

CEDRIC	Yo, I'm done being friendly. I finna be the menace that y'all want me to be. Why you judging me, B? I'm finna fold you like some pants with a pleat. So please watch your mouth talking to me. And I know you couldn't wear my shoes. Prepare for defeat. You deceased. I be the boss. Yeah, you only see C. I'm spitting proper. Man, y'all worse than the coppers. Y'all some fundraising posers that be lawyers and doctors. And football team, one game, and you think you showstoppers? Finna do y'all like 'Pac did popping your prez till it's sour. Flow too cold, I'll be spitting wearing Eddie Bauer. Swear I don't even like this school; the law be complicated and square. Something like a Rubik's cube and I hear y'all got faith in this wack-ass ruby dude. Oops, I meant diamond dude. Swear that he be shining no time at his boss. He think he judge me. I'm god's creature. Stevie Wonder to your hate. From here on, I can't see you.

SYDNEY	What?

CHARLES	Now do you see what I'm talking about?

FOOTBALL TEAM MEMBER	Tavon, get 'em.

SERVER	Crudités?

DANNY	You got something to say about my band?

TERRENCE	Me?

TERRENCE	Okay, little man. You need to step out of my face and go play with your instrument. Or yourself.

DANNY	Just because you lucked into winning a couple of games don't mean shit around here. The marching Mountain Cats still run this.

TERRENCE	Used to.

DANNY	That's big talk... from a man about to lose his spot to Casper the friendly quarterback.

TERRENCE	(inhales deeply, sighs)

FOOTBALL TEAM MEMBER	Damn, T!

WOMAN	Security. Somebody call security.

FOOTBALL TEAM MEMBER	World star! World star!

MAN	Get off. Leave him alone. Get off.

MAN	Get off. Get off.

FOOTBALL TEAM MEMBER	Come on, bro.

MAN	Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.


MAN	Come here! Come here.

MAN	Man, get off him.

FOOTBALL TEAM MEMBER	He threw the first punch.

MAN	Let's go. Keep it moving.

MAN	Let's go. Let's go. Get 'em out of here. Go.

EVA	(sighs)

CARLTON	(sighs)

WOMAN	Eva, I hate to pour salt on the wound, but... I think you should see this.

EVA	Oh, my god.

SYDNEY	So much for being Eva's perfect little party.

MADISON	Why do you hate your mother so much?

SYDNEY	I don't hate her. She's my mother.

MADISON	(sighs) Ryan said he would be here, but now he's not answering his phone. I don't know what to think. I'm just trying not to think the worst.

SYDNEY	And I'm sure he's fine. Bet he's gonna call any minute.

MADISON	No. No, he knew how much I wanted him here. He wouldn't have just flaked. Something must have happened. God, see, this is why I hate being here. You know, what if he got into an accident? What if he's in the hospital or dead on the side of the road or what if--

SYDNEY	What if he just stood you up? I mean, what's more likely, that he's lying in a ditch somewhere or that he's doing a keg stand in some grungy-ass UGA frat house?

MADISON	Thanks, Syd. Feel a lot better.

SYDNEY	So? He's fine, right?

SYDNEY	(gasps)	

MADISON	Syd?

SYDNEY	(sobs)

MADISON	Sydney.

SYDNEY	(sobbing)

MADISON	Sydney?

SYDNEY	(sobbing)

MADISON	Hey, what's wrong?

SYDNEY	(sobbing)

MADISON	Sydney.

SYDNEY	(sobbing) (whimpers)

MADISON	Syd? Please tell me what's wrong.

SYDNEY	(sobbing) That's me. (sobbing)

MADISON	Come here.

SYDNEY	(sobbing)

AEJA	If I looked like you--If I looked like you, I'd kill my ugly-ass self.

JAKE	Embarrass me again and see if I don't choke the life out of you.

MILES	Say another word, and I'll break every bone in your face.


JAKE	Here's something to think about. When you're verbally or physically violent with somebody, they're more likely to be violent with somebody else.

AEJA	We become what we're taught to become, so talk to a professional about your pain, disappointment, and your anger.

JAKE	And almost every city and college campus has free counseling available, and it's for anybody.

MILES	As a man, sometimes it's hard to ask for help.

JAKE	What about this? If you can't do it for yourself, do it for the person you might hurt if you don't get help.

MILES	I'm Miles Stroter.

AEJA	I'm Aeja Lee.

JAKE	And I'm Jake Allyn. Please visit bet.com/shows/the-quad to find a list of websites and phone numbers where you can get information and counseling.

CARLTON	How could you fire the chief without consulting anybody?

EVA	The man treated a rape video with the significance of a groundhog day report.

EBONIE	I'ma battle.

MC	Who are you gonna battle?

EBONIE	(sucks air) Let's see. That clown.

BRYCE	Dude, what is your problem?

CEDRIC	Your Pops never told you what went down between him and me?

BRYCE	You mean when he helped you?

CEDRIC	Helped me?

NONI	Ebonie?

EBONIE	You took my spot?

ELLA	Why did we even bother discussing this if you were gonna do whatever you wanted to do anyway?

EVA	I have to do what I think is right.

ELLA	It's a wonder this school survived before you got here. And how will we ever make it after you're gone?
