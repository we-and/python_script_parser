No.@3@2@2@2@2
Cool.@5@4@4@4@4
Yeah, maybe.@12@11@11@10@10
Why do you think I'm a vegetarian?@34@33@32@27@26
[both chuckle]@14@14@14@13@13
Hey, can we stop for a second?@30@29@29@23@23
I have to go to the bathroom.@29@28@28@22@22
It's-- it's not that.@21@20@18@17@15
Fuck off.@9@8@8@7@7
He's being weird.@17@16@15@14@13
What is he--?@13@12@12@10@10
Eddie!@6@5@5@5@5
Why is he following, Eddie?@27@26@26@22@22
Oh, no! Oh my God.@18@16@16@12@12
Eddie?@6@5@5@5@5
Oh. Oh my God, Eddie.@21@19@19@15@15
Oh my God, we gotta go.@23@22@22@17@17
Please.@7@6@6@6@6
No, no, no.@11@10@10@8@8
Hello?@6@5@5@5@5

I'm lost in the middle of the woods.@36@35@34@28@27
Please, I need help. My stepdad has been shot.@46@44@44@36@36
We just left a rest stop on the main highway.@45@44@44@35@35
Please help him.@16@15@15@13@13
Damn it.@8@7@7@6@6
Mom, it's me. Um--@18@17@16@14@13
Mom, Eddie's been shot. I'm lost in the woods.@46@44@42@36@34
Some guy shot him and now he's after me.@40@39@38@31@30
And I think I lost him, but I don't know.@41@40@39@31@30
Mom, what should I do?@22@21@21@17@17
I tried calling 911,@20@20@20@17@17
but I don't know what else to do.@33@32@31@25@24
Mom.@4@3@3@3@3
Shit.@5@4@4@4@4
Five, four, three, two, one.@28@27@27@23@23

An owl.@7@6@6@5@5
A twig.@7@6@6@5@5
Oh my God.@10@9@9@7@7
Oh my God. He's coming.@23@21@20@17@16
He's coming. Please, I need help.@33@31@30@26@25
He's-he's old and bald,@23@23@21@20@18
and wearing a jean jacket and he has a gun.@43@42@42@33@33
Please, I need help. Please.@28@26@26@22@22
Oh my God. I'm sorry. There's a crazy man after me.@51@48@46@38@36
We have to run, let's go.@25@24@23@19@18
There's a man, he shot my stepdad.@34@33@32@27@26
We have to run, let's go!@25@24@23@19@18
Help! Help!@11@9@9@8@8
He's dead, my stepdad.@22@21@20@18@17
A guy, he killed my stepdad,@28@28@28@23@23
and now he's after me.@22@21@20@17@16
No time for that. He has a gun!@31@29@29@22@22
You have service?@17@16@16@14@14
How can I get service?@22@21@21@17@17
What's the password?@20@19@18@17@16
Run!@4@3@3@3@3
Some guy shot him and now he's after me,@40@40@39@32@31
and I think I lost him, but I don't know.@41@40@39@31@30
Mom, what should I do?@22@21@21@17@17
but I don't know what else to do. Mom.@38@36@35@28@27
Mom?@4@3@3@3@3
Yes! Fucking A!@15@13@13@11@11
I'm okay. Eddie's--@19@18@16@16@14
It all happened so fast.@24@23@23@19@19
I didn't know what to do.@25@24@23@19@18
He told me to run. I didn't want to,@36@35@34@27@26
but he kept telling me to go.@29@28@28@22@22
I'm so sorry, Mom.@18@17@16@14@13
My battery is dying.@20@19@19@16@16
I love you too.@15@14@14@11@11
Oh my God. You're alive.@24@22@21@18@17
You're hurt?@12@11@10@10@9
Are you sure?@13@12@12@10@10
Are you okay?@13@12@12@10@10
I took it from that man.@24@23@23@18@18
I'm sorry, I didn't think.@26@25@23@21@19
I was just gonna get it to use the flashlight.@46@45@45@36@36
I haven't been using it, I was afraid he'd see the light.@57@56@54@45@43
Miranda.@8@7@7@7@7
It's still bleeding.@20@19@18@17@16
I don't know. He...@19@15@14@12@11
followed us from a rest stop and just started shooting.@55@54@54@45@45
He killed my stepdad, and I just ran.@37@36@36@29@29
There's nothing you could've done.@34@33@31@29@27
You're lucky you got away.@26@25@24@21@20
It's okay. I'm not hungry.@26@24@22@20@18
I-- I called 911 and my mom.@28@27@27@21@21
She said people are looking for me.@35@34@34@28@28
But he's still out there.@25@24@23@20@19
What do you think we should do?@31@30@30@24@24
Yeah, I took it from him too.@29@28@28@22@22
Sorry, I always shake like that.@32@31@31@26@26
Yeah.@5@4@4@4@4
How close is it?@16@15@15@12@12
Maybe we should make a run for it.@34@33@33@26@26
I've never been camping before.@31@30@29@26@25
Here, I have meds. Do you want some?@36@34@34@27@27
I'm just supposed to take these every day, but I don't.@55@54@52@44@42
Sometimes I have panic attacks.@31@30@30@26@26
I haven't taken them in weeks.@30@29@28@24@23
Doctor says they'll help.@25@24@23@21@20
A year ago, my father killed himself.@37@36@36@30@30
And I was the one who found him.@32@31@31@24@24
They tried all different kinds of drugs.@40@39@39@33@33
They all make me feel like shit.@32@31@31@25@25
Please. It might help with the pain.@36@34@34@28@28
Me too.@7@6@6@5@5
Here.@5@4@4@4@4
Mushrooms?@10@9@9@9@9
Todd.@5@4@4@4@4
Hey Todd, I found some more food.@33@32@32@26@26
The sun's rising. We should head out.@37@35@34@29@28
Daddy?@6@5@5@5@5
What?@5@4@4@4@4
I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do.@39@37@35@29@27
One.@4@3@3@3@3
One.@4@3@3@3@3
Two.@4@3@3@3@3
Three.@6@5@5@5@5

Help! Help! Help!@17@14@14@12@12
Help! He's right behind me!@27@25@24@21@20
Emily?@6@5@5@5@5
Here it is. This is where Todd is.@34@32@32@25@25
It's almost straight in from here.@34@33@32@28@27
I left a backpack to mark the spot.@35@34@34@27@27
It was his mom's.@17@16@15@13@12
So, that's his name.@20@19@18@16@15
Yeah, that's it. And he was pissed.@35@33@32@27@26
I'm just so hungry.@19@18@17@15@14
Get away from her!@18@17@17@14@14
Did she do that to your face?@29@28@28@22@22
Is that why you chose me?@25@24@24@19@19
Is that why you killed my stepdad@33@33@33@27@27
and followed me through the woods?@34@33@33@28@28
Because I look like your dead wife?@35@34@34@28@28
No, Mom.@8@7@7@6@6
You're pathetic.@16@15@14@14@13
You're nothing.@15@14@13@13@12
Eddie and Todd and even my dad,@31@31@31@25@25
who was out of his mind, were better men than you.@50@49@49@39@39
You're a worthless piece of shit,@33@33@32@28@27
and I look like your dead wife?@31@30@30@24@24
But I'm not dead. I'm alive!@28@26@24@21@19
Ah! Emily! Help me! Help me!@28@24@24@19@19
Mom! No, no!@12@10@10@8@8
Get off!@8@7@7@6@6
Stop!@5@4@4@4@4
I love you.@11@10@10@8@8
I fixed it.@11@10@10@8@8
Eddie... Dad...@15@9@9@8@8
The last thing he said was...@29@26@26@21@21
"Tell your mother I love her."@30@29@29@24@24
Right-- right now?@18@17@17@15@15
Oh-- Oh my gosh.@16@15@15@12@12
Oh, my God.@11@10@10@8@8
Okay. Okay. Okay, Mom. Breathe.@31@27@27@23@23
Breathe, Mom. Breathe.@22@20@20@18@18
Oh, my God. The bag.@20@18@18@14@14
I got the bag.@14@13@13@10@10
Come on. I got the bag. Go. Go, go, go.@39@35@35@26@26
Daddy!@6@5@5@5@5
