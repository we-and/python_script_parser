VOICEOVER:  		People have been struggling to recover from a record-breaking heatwave, and it just keeps getting worse.  Now it’s floods [echoing].  Entire towns have been reduced to ashes.  These fires are now the most destructive. Deforestation is rapidly accelerating … Oxygen levels plummet from deforestation … Extinction rebellers lost the war today as the last tree on Earth was logged in the Amazon. Large areas of ocean algae are dying. The pollution over Europe now so widespread … A fatal respiratory illness is the biggest killer in more than one hundred countries across the globe. Plant life extinct from rations oversubscribed … And supplies are stretched beyond … More than local charities can support. Overpopulation in Africa and the Middle East now catastrophic. Reports of oxygen content dropping. Synthetic oxygen supplies buckle under demand as the UN disbands. Thousands suffocate in … And now Canada has gone down. We’ve lost India. After losing Belgium … Germany is offline. China now completely dark. And all of the Middle East since January. O2 supplies dangerously low and … As survivors flood to the last. The last city not in darkness.

RID VOICEOVER:  	Emergency reroute required.  

RID VOICEOVER:  	90 seconds until nuclear core overload.

ETHAN:		You down the hole tonight?

JUDE:  			Why?  You going to grace us with your presence?

ETHAN:		Hmm!

JUDE:  			Feel her bones.  See if she’ll hold.

RID VOICEOVER:  	Danger.  Evacuate utility tunnel.

ETHAN:		Yeah, she’ll hold. And hell no, I’m not going.

JUDE:  			Oh, come on, man.  There’ll be booze … and small talk.

ETHAN:		Not for all the oxygen in the world.

JUDE:			Hey!  [laughter] 

ETHAN:		Hanging around with a bunch of low-life foggers.

JUDE:	 	 	Low-life foggers have feelings too.  Alright, light it up.



RID VOICEOVER:  	30 seconds until overload.  Evacuation …incomplete.  Utility … tunnel locking down. Sealed. Depressurisation imminent.  

ETHAN:  	You know, you might even find yourself a wife there one of these nights.

JUDE:  			[laughter] Another mouth to feed?  Great plan!  

JUDE:  	How the hell am I going to have time for a wife when I’m stuck down here wiping your ass every day? …

RID VOICEOVER:  	… Ten, nine, eight, seven six …

ETHAN:		Right here!

RID VOICEOVER: 	 … six, five …four, three …

JUDE:  			Light it up, baby!

RID VOICEOVER:  	… two, one, purging.

RID VOICEOVER: 	Power reroute complete.  System stabilised. 

RID VOICEOVER:  	Workers form an orderly line. A reminder that … oxygen credits are not transferable. Chronicorp – breathe easy. 

WORKER:  		I can’t do my shift tomorrow, but it’s no problem …

ETHAN			I’ll take it!

WORKER:  		Yeah, I can make it up. 

ETHAN:  		No, it’s not my fault you don’t want to get paid.  I’ll take your shift.

JUDE:  			We’re ahead, but.

FOREMAN:  		Fine.  You’re in.  He’s out.  

FOREMAN:  		Permanently.

WORKER:  		What?  No!  Hey, hey!

JUDE:  			You good?

ETHAN:  		Yeah, man.  It’s more money in the pocket.

RID VOICEOVER:  	O2 is currently at 3.2 percent.

JUDE:  			Come on, let’s go.  

ETHAN:		Where we heading to?  

JUDE: 	 		Yo, get me the money tomorrow. Owes me money, the bastard.  

ETHAN:  		Hey, Jim.  

PROTESTOR:  		No fire without oxygen.  No fire without oxygen.  You got any smart ideas?  

JUDE:			Get out of here!  

PROTESTOR:  		No fire without oxygen!

JUDE:		 	Get out of here!  

PROTESTOR:  		Hey! 

ETHAN:	 	Come on, Jude.  Just leave it.  

PROTESTOR:  		Listen to me!  No fire without oxygen!

JUDE:			There’s always someone!

PROTESTOR:  		… Generations to come.  Hey!  No, listen.  We have to sacrifice it all for the generations-  Ohhh!  Oxygen is not a privilege!  Don’t listen to him.  I will make you listen. 

WORKER:  		I need my job.

ETHAN:		Get off me!

WORKER:  		My kid’s got the sickness too … 

PROTESTOR:  		… I will make you listen.  

ETHAN:		What do you want me to do? We all need … 

WORKER:  		Listen to me!

PROTESTOR:  		Oxygen is not a privilege!  [screaming]



TV VOICEOVER:  	Another suicide protest today marked the anniversary of the death of the last living plant in captivity.  Since the believed extinction of plant-life, deaths have continued to spiral out of control due to biophysical rejections of the synthetic oxygen that humanity has come to rely on.  As the leading distributor of synthetic O2, Chronicorp is still committed to finding a solution to this oxygen crisis that the world has termed ‘The Sickness’.  However, citizens continue to revolt amid fears that this may be the end for humankind.  Chronicorp’s quantum physicist … Dr Richard Whyte, once radically posed that in the unlikely event that humanity survives this crisis, could we somehow find a solution from our descendants in the future?  Some suggest that his death some 20 years ago is linked to …

ETHAN:		Oh my- 

XANTHE:		Hi.  

ETHAN:		Hi.

XANTHE:		Did I just hear your Dad’s name?

ETHAN:		I got something for you.

XANTHE:		Oh?

ETHAN:		Close your eyes!

XANTHE:		 Okay!  

ETHAN:		Are they closed?

XANTHE:		Yes!

ETHAN:		Alright!  Keep them closed!  

XANTHE:		Mm hmm. 

ETHAN:		Keep them closed!  Okay … open!

XANTHE:		What did you do this time?

ETHAN:		See, um the strap is loose on the other one and I, I still have to seal it.  And well, this one is compatible with the high-grade O2.

XANTHE:		I don’t need that.

ETHAN:		Okay, it’s fine.  I, I got a new shift.  

XANTHE:		 [laughter]  What, this is fashion!

ETHAN:		It looks great!

XANTHE:		Yeah, it does!

ETHAN:		Really?  

XANTHE:		 [laughter] 

XANTHE:		What?  Don’t you want to look pretty too?

ETHAN:		What are you doing?

XANTHE:		Nothing!

ETHAN:		Don’t start this again!  

ETHAN:		Remember what they said, you need to calm down.  You need … You need to relax!

ETHAN:		Shit!  Are you okay?

XANTHE:		Sorry!

ETHAN:		Just give it to me. 

XANTHE:		It’s fine.

ETHAN:		Please!

XANTHE:		It’s fine.

ETHAN:		Shit!

SECURITY GUARD:  	Citizen number 45464?

ETHAN:		Yeah.

SECURITY GUARD:  	We’ve been instructed to bring you upstairs.

JUDE MATHERS:  	We’ve got clearance to be down here. He doesn’t like to be touched.  

XANTHE:		He’ll go if I go.  

JUDE MATHERS:  	You should see what they’ve got to say.  Come on.  

HOLOGRAM 		Greetings, citizen.  Welcome to the Applied Sciences Division of  Chronicorp.  Chronicorp is proud to be the largest supplier of breathable air to the people of the world.  Chronicorp – breathe easy. Greetings, citizen.  Welcome to the Applied Sciences Division of Chronicorp.  Chronicorp is proud to be the largest supplier of breathable air to the people of the world.


REGINA:  	Even the fires burn themselves out.  They can’t breathe either.  My name is Regina Jackson.  I’m the CTO of Particle Research. And you’re Ethan Whyte.

ETHAN WHYTE:  	Um, yes, ma’am.  

REGINA:		How’s your wife?  Our records show that …

ETHAN:		I’m looking after her.

REGINA JACKSON:  	We’ve all accepted that things today are even worse than what scientists predicted. The fact is, the O2 rejection epidemic is going to wipe out the human race within a handful of years.  

ETHAN:		I appreciate you bringing us up here, but what exactly are you offering?

REGINA JACKSON: 	What if I told you that you could save all of us?

ETHAN:		I’d hate to seem like I don’t appreciate this show and tell, but I think we should go … 

REGINA JACKSON:  	… Your security has been upgraded.  You’ll be briefed at lab.  Welcome to our Hail Mary.  Meet the Chronical.

BILLY MITCHELL:  	Billy Mitchell.  Absolute honour to meet you, Ethan. So, you’re the one?  Interesting.

REGINA JACKSON:  	Ethan, do you know what your father did here?

BILLY MITCHELL:  	Right, three minutes, ten seconds. Calibration is within tolerance.  

REGINA JACKSON:  	It’s taken us 20 years.  If only your father could see this.

ETHAN:		My father is not here, is he?

REGINA JACKSON:  	Right, of course.  I’m sorry.  During our first trial, we tested the Chronical with something that wouldn’t take as much power as matter – radio waves to act like a sort of ping, to see what was on the other side. The radio waves bounced back, but they had been changed.  There was something encoded inside.

ETHAN:		Bounced back?  What, what do you mean ‘bounced back’?  From where?

REGINA JACKSON:  	Not where – when.  We received a message from the future.

JUDE:  			From the future?  This is a fucking time machine?  

BILLY MITCHELL:  	407 years into the future.  

ETHAN:		400 years?  You’re telling me people are still alive then?  

BILLY MITCHELL:  	The message was simple, Ethan. RID, Decode Chronical file 170681.  Up here.  

REGINA JACKSON:  	The people who sent the message must have found a cure for the O2 sickness.

ETHAN:		It’s impossible.

REGINA JACKSON:  	There’s no other way they could still be alive that far in the future.  We think they want to give the cure to us so that we could save more people here.  

ETHAN:		Why ask for me?

REGINA JACKSON:  	We don’t exactly know why.  But we may only get one shot at sending someone.  

JUDE:  			One shot?

BILLY MITCHELL:  	The Chronical feeds off the nuclear reactor under the city.  Just to fire a clock a few minutes through time knocks large sections of the city off the grid. To fire the mass of a human that far – let’s just say I hope we don’t have to try this twice.

ETHAN:		Why do I get the feeling that there’s a catch?

REGINA JACKSON:  	Ethan, we don’t know yet how to bring you back.

ETHAN:		You want to shoot me into oblivion with no way to get home?

REGINA JACKSON:  	You have to find the people who sent the message.  They can help you get back.  You have got to find the cure.  You may be humanity’s only chance.  You may be your wife’s only chance.  

HAWKER:  		Beautiful, crisp, clean air.  Air you can breathe!  All at twenty dollars an hour!

JUDE:  			Have you ever seen anything like this shit before?  Two more.

ETHAN:		It’s all very impressive.  I’m not leaving Xanthe as a favour to those ghouls.

JUDE:  			Easy.

ETHAN:		He’s buying.

JUDE:  			Let’s take a walk.

ETHAN:		I know, right?

JUDE:  			What’s the matter with you?  

ETHAN:		What? D-do you really believe I’m going to save the world?  Very romantic.  

JUDE:  			You need to take this seriously.  Your old man believed it. 

ETHAN:		My old man was a fool and a liar.  

JUDE:  			What if there’s more to his story, Ethe?

ETHAN:		Story?  You want to hear more?  

ETHAN:		A father leaves a suicide note for his eight-year old son. If he’d just been there instead of chasing fucking rainbows, my mother would still be alive.  Very heroic.   And as if this wasn’t enough of a reminder for that you want me to do what?  Follow in his footsteps, to leave my sick wife to die?

JUDE:  		I remember when I brought you down to the tunnels for the first time.  You were so scared of just being left alone.  Do you remember what I told you?  

ETHAN:		Without the darkness, there’s no light.  Stupid saying.  

JUDE:  		Fuck you. Listen, shithead, I’ve been through hell and back in this life.  I’ve lost my family.  Damn near lost my mind.  I’ve been working in those fucking tunnels for as long as I can remember, and the only thing I know that works is when we fight for ourselves. Protect what’s ours. 

ETHAN:		I can protect Xanthe.  I’m not just going to abandon her. 

JUDE:  		And what are you going to do when she gets worse? This ain’t about saving the world, bro. You want to prove that you’re not like him? Save her.

SELENE		He’s been waiting for you all day.

RICHARD		I made this for you, Ethie, because I have it on good authority that you are going to grow up to be someone very important.  

YOUNG ETHAN:  	A science man?

RICHARD	A science man.  Now, this is going to hurt, a little.  But it will help you become who you are meant to be.  One day, you’ll understand it. You will want to trust what you can see with your own eyes, but it won’t be enough. And you will need to make a choice about whether you believe in something bigger. 

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Believe in what?

RICHARD		Believe in people

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Ow!

RICHARD		I’m sorry, Ethie.  It … 

SELENE		What?

RICHARD		It won’t come off.

SELENE		What’s wrong with you?  

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Papa.

SELENE:		Don’t you dare leave us again!

XANTHE		When?

ETHAN:		I’m not leaving you to chase some stupid fantasy.

XANTHE		You think a second chance is a fantasy?  How could you say that?  

ETHAN:		Fucking scientists.

XANTHE		Do you think your tool kit is important right now?

ETHAN:		My tools need to be clean.  

XANTHE		Look at me!

ETHAN:		I have responsibilities here.  I need to meet my shifts.  We’re so close to having enough for the high-grade O2.  That could help you.  

XANTHE		It could slow down the symptoms. Don’t do that.  Don’t do that.  

ETHAN:		What?

XANTHE		You can say that you’re afraid.  But don’t you dare use me as an excuse.  You’re better than that, Ethan!  

ETHAN:		What?  What are you talking about?  You’re everything to me.  I can look after you.  I can help you.  I can make more money.  I can make you okay!  Who’s to say that time is anything we should mess with anyway?  What if I can’t change anything?  

XANTHE 		Who’s to say that we can’t?  

ETHAN:		Okay.  What if I could?  What if I mess with something and it makes everything worse?

XANTHE 		I can’t believe what I’m hearing right now.  

ETHAN:		No.  I’m not going to risk losing you.

XANTHE 		You can’t lose me!

ETHAN:		Of course I can!  

XANTHE 		You’ve got to have faith, Ethe, that you can be bigger.  

ETHAN:		Faith isn’t going to protect you. 

XANTHE 		Now is not the time to have your tail between your legs.

ETHAN:		We’re a team.  Why aren’t you on my side?

XANTHE 		Last year, I had twenty kids in my class.  This year, I have twelve. I saw three of them suffocate, right in front of me.  

ETHAN:		You’re the only one I care about.

XANTHE 		I wouldn’t be with you if I thought that was true.  I’m afraid too Ethan.  But I know that you’ll come back to me.  I believe in you.

ETHAN:		 [screaming]

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Murderer!  

ETHAN:		Fuck!

JUDE MATHERS:  	[echoing] Your father is not here.

ETHAN:		[screaming] I don’t care if I can only find one dose of this cure. Xanthe gets the first one, or I’m not going.  You need me.

REGINA 		Okay, Ethan.  We have a deal.

BILLY 	These aren’t just space suits Ethan.  These are my babies. Fenrir is not quite ready.  But Tyr, she’ll get you there.  She’ll protect you.  

REGINA 	The Chronical at this time can’t tether to itself in the future.  There’s something wrong at the other end.

ETHAN:		What the hell does that mean?

BILLY 			It means we’re going to have to throw you there.  

ETHAN:		Throw me there?  

BILLY 	Without being tethered at the other end, there’s a chance you could land inside a mountain, or the ocean.  So …

ETHAN:		You’ve got to be kidding me!

BILLY 			We have to aim a little higher.

REGINA 		We’ll land you as close as we can to the source of the radio waves.  You just find the people. Track them down and bring the cure back home to us.  

ETHAN:		Sounds easy.

REGINA 	This may be humankind’s most critical journey.  I’m counting on you to find a way back, Ethan.  

ETHAN:		 [sighing] Fuck.

BILLY 			Okay.  One more time. Focus. Who’s this?

ETHAN:		Archie.

BILLY 			Yeah.  What does Archie do?

ETHAN:		Ah … Systems analysis.  Navigation.  Communication.  

BILLY 		Yeah, that’s right.  Archie is your only friend. So, treat her well. The suit will send your vitals back to us from Archie, so we’re going to know you’re safe. We’ll be watching. Hold your breath. Look at me. Do not let go.

ETHAN:		 [whimpering]

RID VOICEOVER:  	Firing Quantum Field.

ETHAN:		Look after her.  

JUDE 			Only ‘til you get back.

ETHAN:		 [panting]

JUDE 			I’ll see you soon, brother. Go bring back the light.

VOICEOVER:  		Are you there?

ETHAN:	[exclamation / screaming] Hello. Come on.  Ethan Whyte, come in. Ethan Whyte to base, come in.  Archie!

ARCHIE:  		Hello … Ethan.

ETHAN:		Archie, where are we?

ARCHIE:  		Let me find a satellite. Satellite link failed.  Location unknown. Searching, searching.  Satellite link failed.  

ETHAN:		Archie Geography magnetics. Go.

ARCHIE:  		I have detected a structure.  It’s not far. Follow me.  

ETHAN:		 [sniffing] Fuck! Am I going to die here? Fuck you.  Archie?

ARCHIE:  		I’m here, Ethan.

ETHAN:		Why are there two of me here at once?

ARCHIE:  		I don’t think this is a second you, Ethan. I think this is you.

ETHAN:		So, I’m dead and alive at the same time?

ARCHIE:  		Even I have trouble with time travel, Ethan.  

ETHAN:		Very helpful.  Thanks.

ARCHIE:  		My pleasure.

ETHAN:		Archie?

BOTH ARCHIES:  	Yes, Ethan?  

ETHAN:		Status?

ARCHIE:  		Nuclear cell at two percent. Display offline.

ETHAN:		Replay last recording. Am I going to die here?

JUDE			Maybe it’s better this way.  No-one is suffering anymore.  

ETHAN:		What did you have to sacrifice?  

JUDE		I am your family. I did this for [static] you.  This is our fate! [groaning] Breathe!  Breathe!  

ETHAN:		No!  No!  No! [gunshot sound]

ARCHIE:  		Power failure.  Shutting down.  Goodbye …

ETHAN:		No, no, no, no!  Archie!  Archie! Diagnose.

ARCHIE:  		Signal found.  It’s an emergency beacon. We should make contact. Follow me.

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Stars …  Stars… How are we like stars?  That’s silly.

RICHARD 		Okay. Try this.  [obscure mumbling]

RICHARD VOICEOVER:  	So, you see, Ethan, I will never let anything happen to you.

ETHAN:		Fuck you!  Fuck you too! Oh! [muffled voice] You’re not real!  You’re not real!  You’re not real! What the … What the hell? 

MUFFLED VOICE:  	You poisoned yourself.  Because of the strawberries … 

ETHAN:		 [gasping] Jude?

JUDE 		You’ll be okay, kid.  As long as you do what I say. Right away, we knew something was wrong.  We could see your pulse echoing back and your blood toxicity level spiked.  Poison. Your heart stopped. I watched you die, Ethe.

ETHAN:		I’m not dead.  Am I?

JUDE 	I don’t think so. Billy said he had just enough power to fire the Chronical one last time.  I grabbed the second suit.  Couldn’t leave you down here all by your lonesome.  I told them I could bring you back.

ETHAN:		You came for me.

JUDE 	Yeah, hit the ground like a tonne of bricks.  Everything was destroyed – my suit, everything.  Just happy to be alive, man.  Happy to see your ugly mug.  Happy to be breathing without a fucking mask. 

ETHAN:		Xanthe?

JUDE 			She needs you.

ETHAN:		There’s a problem.

JUDE			What the hell is this?

ETHAN:		I thought you saved me.  But I’m still dead.

JUDE			No. No, this isn’t right.  I mean this isn’t you.

ETHAN:		I thought you said I was poisoned.  

JUDE 			You were.  I think we changed that … didn’t we?

JUDE 			Something’s very wrong. 

ETHAN:		You think?

JUDE 			Listen, was there anything else here?

ETHAN:		L-like what? A gun? I’d say whoever left that hole in my head took off with it.  

JUDE 			So, this fucking bag of bones is not you? Eating berries again, huh?

ETHAN:		Well, whoever sent for me for them to survive this long, to regrow this place they must’ve found a cure. If I don’t find them in time, Xanthe’s … 

JUDE			Well, let’s find them. 

ETHAN:		Yeah, we were sent here for a reason.  

JUDE			Now we follow the breadcrumbs.  

ARCHIE:  		Emergency beacon saturation.  98 percent.  

ETHAN:		We’re close.

JUDE			Ready?

ETHAN:		Let’s see if anyone’s home.  

JUDE			I’ve got your back.

ETHAN:		Hello?

JUDE			Careful.

ETHAN:		Hello?

JUDE			Ethe!  

ETHAN:		Hey, stick with me, Jude.

JUDE 			Can’t see shit.  

ETHAN:		Activate what?

JUDE			Come out!

ETHAN:		Access? Not possible.

ARCHIE:  		Hello, RID One. 

JUDE 			Hail Mary, brother.  

RID VOICEOVER:  	Hello. RID eighty-one thousand two hundred and seventy.  Ethan Whyte. DNA identity confirmed.  Chronical access granted. Portal priming sequence commencing. Countdown commencing. Four hours to portal activation.  Destination 2067 AD. 

JUDE 			Ethan! Ethan, if this puppy still works, we can use it to get home.  

ETHAN:		Where are the people?

JUDE 			Doesn’t look like anyone’s home.  

ETHAN:		Just doesn’t make sense.  This is all wrong.

JUDE 			I’m just looking at what’s in front of me, man, and I see a lifeboat.  

ETHAN:		I thought when you saved me from the poison that it changed the course of everything.  Obviously, it changed nothing.  

JUDE 			What does that mean?

ETHAN:		It means there’s something bigger at play.  When this thing scanned my blood, the light, it’s been red my whole life, it just changed to green.  This one from the skeleton, it was already green. 

JUDE 			So what?

ETHAN:		It means the dead me has been through this before.

JUDE 			The dead you?

ETHAN:		Every step I’m taking, he took. 

JUDE 			Are you listening to yourself? 

ETHAN:		How is that possible? It’s like he’s my future.  It’s like I’m becoming him. 

JUDE 		It’s not possible. You’ve got to bring him down, brother. You’re losing your mind, man.

ETHAN:		RID?

RID VOICEOVER: 	Yes, Ethan?

ETHAN:		Does this thing give me access to the Chronical’s data backup?

RID VOICEOVER:  	Yes, Ethan. 

ETHAN:		Decode the system logs.

HOLOGRAM RW	Chronical log number one. We are at the beginning of the journey that could change everything. My name is Professor Richard Whyte.  I am the lead physicist at The Chronical Project. We have discovered an anomaly in the Higgs Field, which might soon allow us to send radio waves and eventually, matter, through time.  

ETHAN:		Stop!

JUDE 			What makes you think you’re going to find what you’re looking for?  

ETHAN:		I have to.

JUDE 			No, you don’t.

HOLOGRAM RW 	We have buried an atmospheric monitoring station. It will continue to operate and if it reaches a time in the future when the air is breathable, it will send this data back to us through the Chronical.  Our hope is that the Chronical will help us learn from our descendants how they replenished the O2 levels.  

JUDE 			Enough. This is going to hurt more than it helps.  

ETHAN:		I can’t run from him forever.  Please.  

HOLOGRAM RW	Log 97.

RICHARD		Bring your a-game, people.  Prep the countdown. Our entire lives have led to this moment.  We are preparing subject number one.  The radio wave packet that will ping the Chronical in the future.  If it works, we should get an echo with data on the O2 levels.  

RID VOICEOVER:  	Firing ping control in three, two, one …

RID VOICEOVER:  	Echo received.  Ping returned. 

RID VOICEOVER:  	Date: 2474 AD.

RICHARD WHYTE:  	It works.  

RID VOICEOVER:  	Ping echo decoded. Data has been manually overridden at destination.  English words encoded in transmission.  

RICHARD 		English?  What? Jesus.  

REGINA 		What in god’s name?

RICHARD		I didn’t do this. How is this possible?  

REGINA 		You need to make this work.

RICHARD		It is working.  Someone’s calling for my son.  

REGINA		How the fuck did they know about your son? 

RICHARD		I can’t explain it.

REGINA		Don’t tell me that.  We all have families.  

RICHARD		It is working.  Someone sent us this message.  There is someone at the other end.  

REGINA		So, we move to the next phase.  How long before we can test sending matter?

BILLY			We can’t.  

REGINA		Speak.

BILLY 			There’s a problem with the power at 2474.

RID VOICEOVER:  	Warning!  Nuclear core power failure.  Warning!  Chronical systems offline.

ETHAN:		Archie!  Diagnose.  

ARCHIE:  		Nuclear core: cold fusion power feed corrupt.  

ETHAN:		What does that mean?

ARCHIE:  		The portal will not tether to 2067, Ethan.  There is not enough power.

JUDE			Archie, where is the failure?

ARCHIE:  		Searching, searching …  Nuclear Core Control room.  Access via service tunnel section 7.

JUDE			RID?

RID VOICEOVER:  	Yes, Jude Mathers?

JUDE			Why hasn’t the countdown stopped?

RID VOICEOVER:  	Jude Mathers the Chronical priming sequence has commenced.  It cannot be stopped.  The system would reach unstable particle levels.  

JUDE			Define unstable.

RID VOICEOVER:  	If the power feed is not reconnected before the countdown reaches zero, the charged particles in the Chronical will create a nuclear explosion.  

JUDE MATHERS:  	Nuclear explosion doesn’t sound good. Let’s not die today, Ethe!  

ETHAN	Wait.They received this message all that time ago.  They knew about the power failure.  

JUDE	RID! If we fix the Chronical’s power, how long with the portal stay open before the nuclear core drains?

RID VOICEOVER:  	Once the countdown reaches zero, the portal will tether to two thousand and sixty-seven for approximately 30 seconds.

JUDE		Ethe, it’s going to take us hours to get down to the core.  We’ve got to gun it there now.

ETHAN:		Jesus Christ.  Did you not see what I just saw? Someone sent that message from here. Th-that means they fixed this place.  Th-that means they have a cure.  They can help me fix Xanthe!

JUDE			Yeah, whoever sent the message, they’re not here.  

ETHAN:		Why didn’t they tell us about the power failure?  Why did they send you?

JUDE			What?  I came to save you.  Stab anti-toxin in your dead body.  

ETHAN:		But why not send a soldier or a medic?

JUDE		Who else is going to damn near kill themselves to save your thankless ass? Listen, man, you were right.  We can’t save everyone.  But I can save you.  Let’s go.  

ETHAN:		No, I was wrong.  I need to figure this out.  

JUDE	We’ve got one shot at fixing this thing. One shot, Ethan! I can’t do it without you, brother.  So, let’s take control. We’ve got to take control, little brother! 

ETHAN:		I need … I need more time!  

JUDE			Don’t you want to see Xanthe again?

ETHAN:		Don’t use her like that!

JUDE			I’m not going to let you get yourself killed!

ETHAN:		Get off me!

JUDE		Just wake up, kid.  I mean I’ve never let you down.  So, don’t let me down now.  

RID VOICEOVER:  	Three hours fifty minutes to nuclear explosion.

ETHAN:		Okay.  Okay.  Whoever sent a message, they’re not here. We just need to make our way down to the access tunnel.  We need to turn the power on. And then we’ll have enough time to find them.  

JUDE 			Three hours fifty minutes.  Tick-tock.

ETHAN:		The city should be right here. They never found a way to survive. The earth just waited for us to die.

JUDE			Ethe, where are you taking us? Because this ain’t the way.

ETHAN:		They just died here in the classroom, just sitting here. 

JUDE			Yeah, things got worse.

ETHAN:		They didn’t even remove the dead.  Does this mean that we failed?

JUDE			Ethe! Ethe!  Ethe, don’t! Ethan!

ETHAN:		 [whimpering] Xanthe!  

JUDE 			It’s okay, buddy.

SELENE 		Don’t you dare leave again!

SELENE 		Richard, where are you?  What have you done to him?  Look, what?  No, I … No, I don’t understand.  You’re going to have to tell him yourself. Ethie.  

RICHARD VOICE:  	Ethie, listen to me.  I need you to go for a little walk with your Mama.  

YOUNG ETHAN:  	I want to stay here. 

RICHARD VOICE:	I will meet you.  I promise.  Do you understand?  You have to trust me now.

SELENE 		You have to climb up there, baby.  Quick!  Climb, baby!  

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Mama!  

SELENE		Ethan! We don’t have anything!

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Mama!  

SELENE		Please, he’s just a boy!  Please, no!

SELENE		[gasping] No!  

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Mama!  

SELENE		No!  

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Mama! Mama! 

SELENE		I’m with you!  [gasping her last]

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Mama!  Mama! [gasping] Papa!  Papa!  Papa!  Papa!   Papa!  Papa!  Papa!  Papa!  

YOUNG JUDE M:  	Breathe!  Come on, breathe! You’ve got to fight for yourself now!   Your father is not here. 

JUDE			Breathe.  Breathe!  

ETHAN:		No!  

JUDE			Breathe!

ETHAN:		No!  No!  

JUDE			Breathe!

ETHAN:		 [gasping]  

JUDE 			Breathe! Breathe! There you go.  Oh! Jesus!

ETHAN:		I have to get back to her.  I have to.  

JUDE			I know.  

ETHAN:		How could I leave her alone?

JUDE			Well, you did what you thought was right, Ethe.  

ETHAN:		Did I? I promised her I’d come back.  We’re in control of our fate, right?  Just got to have fucking faith.  Just got to have faith. I, I can’t lose her again.

JUDE			It’s not your fault.

ETHAN:		I left her to die. 

JUDE			Hey.  You’re not him, Ethe.

ETHAN:		What, what if we can’t change anything?  

JUDE			Maybe it’s not our place.

ETHAN:		That can’t be true. Th-there has to be a way.  

JUDE			It’s dust and … Dust and bones.

ETHAN:		It can’t be the only way.  It can’t!  We …

JUDE		No more detours. But maybe it’s better this way.  No-one is suffering anymore. Come on.

ETHAN:		What did you just say?  

JUDE			What?  What?

ETHAN:		Archie!  Archie!  Repeat last playback.    

JUDE			Who’s that? Maybe it’s better this way. No-one is suffering anymore.  

ARCHIE:  		Data corrupt.

ARCHIE:  		Skipping ahead.  

ETHAN:		What did you have to sacrifice?  

JUDE			I did this for you. What?

ETHAN:		You did this for yourself.

JUDE			This is our fate, Ethan!  There is no other way!

ETHAN:		Wait!  What did you say?  No, no, no, no! No, no!  No!  

JUDE			Fight me! I’m so sorry.

ETHAN:		No!  

ARCHIE:  		Power failure.  Shutdown.

ETHAN:		No!

ARCHIE:  		Power failure.  Shutdown.

ETHAN:		What … What are you doing? 

JUDE			Why the fuck is my voice in that thing?  

ETHAN:		You tell me.

JUDE			Why did you hide that from me? Why did you hide that from me?  

ETHAN:		Why do you have a gun?

JUDE			It’s protection.

ETHAN:		From what?  You said it yourself.  This place, it’s dust and bones.  Protection from what?  Me?  Are you going to shoot me, brother? 

JUDE			What?

JUDE			You’re losing your mind.  

JUDE			That’s not me on that thing!

ETHAN:		Jude, Jude!  Give me the gun! 

JUDE			I’m in control.  

ETHAN:		Please!  

JUDE 			Why did you trick me?  

ETHAN:		Please, please, please. Please, Jude, give me the gun.  

JUDE			Stay right there.   

ETHAN:		Just …

JUDE			Stay right there. 

ETHAN:		Just give me the gun, Jude.

JUDE			I’m in control.

ETHAN:		Please! You know how my skeleton got there, don’t you?  

ARCHIE:  		Warning! Two hours to nuclear explosion.

ETHAN:		Please, please, please!  

JUDE			Move!

ETHAN:		You want to tell me what you’re doing?

JUDE			Saving you from yourself.  Move.

ETHAN:		Looks like we found our problem.  

RID VOICEOVER:  	Emergency reroute required.

ETHAN:		It’s all fried. Got to reroute the power.  Archie!  Reroute stability. 

ARCHIE:  		Reroute stability: 30 percent, Ethan.  

ETHAN:		Okay, hit it!  Come on!  

RID VOICEOVER:  	Power reroute failure.  

JUDE			You haven’t given us a fucking chance!

RID VOICEOVER:  	Evacuate service chamber.  

JUDE			You need to get the door!

JUDE			[screaming]

RID VOICEOVER:  	Depressurisation required.  

JUDE			RID! Override!

RID VOICEOVER:  	Unable to comply.  

ETHAN:		It won’t work. We need to manually pull the backup breaker while the room is depressurised.

JUDE			[screaming] We’re going to die in here.

RID VOICEOVER:  	Purging O2.  

ETHAN:		You won’t.  

JUDE			No! No! [screaming] Ethan! Ethan! No! No!

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Stars.  How are we like stars …

RID VOICEOVER:  	Power restored.  Nuclear core active.  

JUDE			RID!  System status?

RID VOICEOVER:  	Chronical Systems online.  Critical systems nominal.  37 minutes to portal launch. 

JUDE			Thank fucking Christ.  [laughter] 

ETHAN:		Where does this go? No, no!

JUDE			What?

ETHAN:		How couldn’t I see it?  

JUDE			See what? 

ETHAN:		Th-the future, it’s It’s already written.  We’re just turning the fucking pages.

JUDE			Give that to me.

ETHAN:		No.

JUDE			Ethan, stop playing games.  

ETHAN:		I, I am going to die. What happens next, Jude? I thought that when we changed my death, it meant that I could change fate. Mine, Xanthe’s, everyone’s.  But the skeleton, it’s still there.  My skeleton is still here!

JUDE			Why are we still talking about a fucking skeleton?

ETHAN:		My skeleton is still here, because we can’t change anything! Everything was always going to play out this way.  No matter what we do it’s leading us to that moment.

JUDE			You’re confusing yourself, Ethan. 

ETHAN:		Ha!  We’re going to go home and you’re going to shoot me in the head and I’m going to rot in that hallway for 400 years.   Am I not useful to you anymore, brother?  You wouldn’t lie to me.  

JUDE			Why would I?  Why would I? 

ETHAN:		Because you know I’m never going to see her again.  

JUDE			I’m protecting you!

ETHAN:		By putting a fucking gun to my head?  Archie?

ARCHIE:  		Yes, Ethan …

JUDE			… Put that fucking thing away.

ETHAN:		Play last recording.  No, Jude! No, Jude!

JUDE			Fight me!  

ETHAN:		No, no!  No!  

JUDE			Fight me! 

ETHAN:		No!

JUDE			I wouldn’t.  

ETHAN:		The second I got here, i-it was staring me in the face.  I just didn’t want to believe it was you.

JUDE			It’s not me, Ethan!  

ETHAN:		Why? Why wait until we get back to do it?  Why not just fucking do it now? 

JUDE			[screaming]

ETHAN:		How could you do that to me?  

JUDE			It’s not the plan!

ETHAN:		What plan? 

JUDE			We’ve got to get out of here.

ETHAN:		What fucking plan?

JUDE			Leave now!  We can change everything!  

ETHAN:		Get off! Fuck!  What fucking plan?

JUDE			You’ve got to trust me!  I’m protecting you, goddammit!

ETHAN:		Fuck! Fuck!

RID VOICEOVER:  	30 minutes to portal launch.

JUDE		I’m in control.  I’m in control. This place is alive, Ethan. There’s no reason we can’t live here.

ETHAN:		And leave everyone to die?  There’s no masks.  

JUDE			You can’t stop them.  I saved you, Ethan, but we can’t save everyone.  

ETHAN:		You’ve lost your fucking mind. Stay away from me!  

JUDE 			Ethan!

ETHAN:		My birthday!

HOLOGRAM RW:  	I’ve made a terrible mistake. I can’t play God. We don’t belong in God’s playground. [banging noises]

ETHAN:		Jude!  What the fuck!  

JUDE 		You’re not going to find what you’re looking for. Ethan! Ohhh! Ethan! There is no other way!

HOLOGRAM RW:  	[mumbling] God’s playground  [mumbling] We don’t belong in God’s playground.  

JUDE 			[screaming in background]

HOLOGRAM RW:	Maybe one day I’ll be man enough to say this to your face.  All of this was for you, Ethan. If I could give you the life I never had, then you’d know that I love you, wouldn’t you? It’s the hardest thing to admit what you’re afraid of. I never had a father.  I don’t know if you know that. Why did I run away? I should’ve been there for you.  I should’ve been there for you.  I didn’t know how.  I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Fuck.  RID, dial home.

SELENE 		Richard, where are you?  What have you done to him?

RICHARD 		Sweetheart, I don't have time to explain.  I need you to take Ethan and leave the house. Meet me where we first met.  

SELENE 	No, what?  No.  I don’t understand.  You’re going to have to tell him yourself.  Ethie?

RICHARD 		Ethie, I need you to go for a little walk with your mum.  

YOUNG ETHAN:  	I want to say here.  

RICHARD 	I will meet you.  I promise. I will meet you.  I promise.  You have to trust me now.

RID VOICEOVER:  	Entry granted.

RICHARD 		End call.

ETHAN:		Jude!

HOLOGRAM RW:  	I can’t let you do it.  

REGINA 		What do you think you know, Richard?

HOLOGRAM RW:  	This isn’t about finding a cure anymore, is it?

RICHARD 		You want to escape.  Just leave the world behind.  

REGINA 		There is no cure.  

RICHARD 		That message was sent by someone.  There must be a cure.  We have a responsibility.

REGINA 		It’s too late for that.  This world is done, Richard. You want to save them all?  Most of them would cut your throat for one breath of fresh air.  They wouldn’t know what to do with another chance.

RICHARD		You’re wrong!

REGINA		Even if we could save them, humans are a virus.  The earth will heal, but never while we’re suffocating it.  

RICHARD		This isn’t the way.

REGINA	This is the only way. The earth needs time without us. So, we jump ahead, start again, or humanity dies for nothing. 

RICHARD		Who?  Your chosen few?  I know you’ve lost people, but you can’t …

REGINA		… This isn’t about me, Richard.  You’re right.  People are going to have to die. It’s not an easy decision, but it’s the right one.  It’s not what we want.  It’s what we need.

RICHARD 		You need to have faith.

REGINA 	You’re the scientist here.  You want to talk about faith?  I am not risking the survival of humanity on your faith.  

BILLY 	Hey, Richard.  I just wanted to say thank you so much for giving me this chance.  I’ve run the numbers.  I’m sure it will work.  I’ve got the design team working on a rough outline as we speak.  I’ve got the design team working on a rough outline as we speak.  

RICHARD 		An outline for what?

BILLY 			What? Wait.  Did Richard not authorise this?

REGINA 		Is it going to work or not?

BILLY		I think so. Yes, I mean it’ll take some time.  But I think we can eventually jerry-rig the Chronical to fire a person one way, kind of like a sling-shot or, or a catapult.  

RICHARD		That’s suicide.  You’re going to kill someone.  

BILLY MITCHELL:  	With some kind of protective suit, they might have a chance. All we need is one person to fix the power on the Chronical in the future right?  We fix the power, she opens up the portal, and we can go safely through.  

REGINA	The ping came back. There’s oxygen there.  It proves the plan has already worked.  Earth regrows only because mankind doesn’t make it. 

RICHARD	No!  I don’t believe it’s the only way. I’ve locked the system, so only Ethan’s DNA can activate the Chronical at the other end.  Somebody sent for him. And whether you believe or not you need him if you want to open the portal. 

REGINA		Can you do it? Can you get one person through?

BILLY			I mean I think it might be possible, but it’s Richard’s science.  So … 

REGINA		Can you make it work?  Can you make it work?

BILLY 			Yes!

ETHAN			[gasp / screaming] Fuck!  [screaming]

JUDE			Stop!  Stop! Dammit, stop!  Stop.  

YOUNG JUDE:  	Ms Jackson, I, I don’t …

HOLOGRAM RJ:  	Go down with the team. Go down with the team.  Make sure the boy stays alive. You will be his guardian.  Let nothing happen to him, you understand? He is the key to everything now.
JUDE			I know.

RID VOICEOVER:  	30 minutes to portal launch. 

ETHAN:		Fuck you! You fucking liar! All this time, you used me! You used me!

JUDE			They used us!  I was just a kid, man.  

JUDE 		They’re still coming, Ethan.  Even if you try and stop them, then the world you care so much about, they die for nothing.  

ETHAN:		That can’t be true.

JUDE		We can’t change the past!  Even if we could, what would happen to this place? What would happen to us?

ETHAN:		I don’t know! But we can’t leave millions of people to die!

JUDE	They have already died! It’s already happened, man! There is no cure!  Ethe, you said it yourself. Things can’t be changed, little brother.  

ETHAN:		I’m not your brother.

JUDE	You sound like your father now.  You know, if he had listened to Jackson, he’d still be here.  Only the strong survive, Ethan.

ETHAN:		So, you bought yourself a place in the new world.  What did you have to sacrifice?  Me?  Xanthe?

JUDE			I am your family.  I did this for you.  

ETHAN:		You did this for yourself. There has to be another way.  I have to stop this thing.  

JUDE			I can’t let you. 

ETHAN:		I have to stop this thing!

JUDE			There is no other way. This is our fate.  There is no other way.

ETHAN:		 [grunting] What did you say? 

JUDE			I’m sorry. 

ETHAN:		No, no, no!

JUDE			I’m sorry!

ETHAN:		No, no, no!  

JUDE			Fight, Ethan.  Ethan, Ethan, fight me!  Fight me!

ETHAN:		No, please, no!  No! 

JUDE			Fight me!

ETHAN:		No! 

ETHAN:		No!  Don’t!  No, don’t, don’t …

JUDE			… Fight me!

ETHAN:		Please, no, no.  No!

JUDE			Fight me!

ETHAN:		No!

YOUNG JUDE:  	You’ve got to fight for yourself now!  

JUDE			Fight me!

ETHAN:		No. No!

JUDE			[screaming] Please!  You’ve got to fight.  

ETHAN:		I believe in you.   I believe in you.

JUDE			It is me.  I can’t change. I’m so sorry.

ETHAN:		 [gasping / crying] Oh, Jude!

REGINA		Distinguished friends. You have stood with me while you watched your world fall down around you.  This is our time. Each one of you has played a part in bringing us to this point. History will not forget you. This day will be marked as the day that we proved that we will not go quietly into the night. The day the human race took control of its fate.

RICHARD	I have it on good authority that you are going to grow up to be someone very important. This is going to hurt. But it will help you become who you are meant to be. One day, you’ll understand it.  You will want to trust what you can see with your own eyes, but it won’t be enough. And you will need to make a choice about whether you believe in something bigger.  
ETHAN:		Archie?

ARCHIE:  		Yes, Ethan?

ETHAN:		Someone is here.

ARCHIE:  		Who is here, Ethan?

ETHAN:		I’m here. I believe.

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Believe in… Believe in what?  

RICHARD		Believe in people.

JUDE			Fight me!

RICHARD		I’m sorry.

RID VOICEOVER:  	Incoming particle stream.

REGINA	Ethan. He’s a liability. Shoot him. Leave him here. Once we’ve gone, it won’t matter. Remember the drill.  We have one shot. Once the portal opens, we have 30 seconds to clear through.

RID VOICEOVER:  	10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, zero. Tether interrupted.  Shutting down.

REGINA		No! No! No, no!  No!  No!

BROADCASTER:  	Chronicorp’s headquarters were raided just moments ago after this news station received an anonymous broadcast.  Officials seized hundreds of believed extinct plants.  If what we are hearing is true, this may be the second chance the world so desperately needs for ecological regeneration. Religious groups are already calling it the ‘deus ex machina’, or ‘god out of the machine’.

RID VOICEOVER:  	Entry request.  Entry request.  Security override.

OFFICIAL:  		Xanthe Whyte?  

YOUNG ETHAN:  	Stars … How are we like stars?  Silly.  

RICHARD		Okay, here. Now, try this.  What’s between us?

YOUNG ETHAN:	Your hands?

RICHARD		No here. Imagine for a moment that we are all physically connected by the very fabric of the universe. An invisible field that bonds us together.  Everything in the universe, you, me, the stars.  We are all connected through time.  So, you see, Ethie, even when I am not with you we are always together.

ETHAN			[panting]
