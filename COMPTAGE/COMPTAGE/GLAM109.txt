VICTOR	I have to say it: my charisma makes me irresistible. 

CRYSTAL	Hey Victor, we are having a party this evening, we want to invite some nice guys 

VICTOR	Great!

ELECTRA	Yes. And so we thought of David. Do you have his number?

VICTOR	(Reaction) Forget it

BOHEME	Observe the quality of the finishes, the buttonholes. When you finish your period costume we can have a fashion show that...

BOHEME	Hey! At least let me finish my sentence! 

VICTOR	Professor, Professor!

VOICE OVER VICTOR VLOG	A few minutes of ‘academic’ delay are permitted for all of the best artists.

VICTOR	(Reactions) Ehm, sorry teacher, I didn’t know that the class was here.

BOHEME	And it took you two hours to find it? 

VICTOR	Uhm uhmm but what is the assignment for next time?

BOHEME	Ask your classmates.

VICTOR	I’m begging you: tell me what the assignment is or I’m dead!

ELECTRA	Should we tell him?

CRYSTAL	I don’t know...even the last link in the food chain can be a useful ally at times.

VICTOR	Ok.. here is David’s number

ELECTRA	Alright. You have to make a Victorian costume. Like in 1800s England. Look in the laboratory: the models are there.

CRYSTAL	Ah... Vic...you will never do it, you know? All of us are already started on the work and you’re slow...

VICTOR	Perfect! Perfect - an accident... I’ll never manage it...

VICTOR	I have to admit it: I’m a disaster with the sewing machine. I needed an idea...

CRYSTAL	Have you seen my stapler by any chance, I always use it for my models

ELECTRA	No, sorry

VICTOR	Of course! I can staple the clothes!

REBECCA	But how long does it take? I can’t stand these exams

CRYSTAL	So, did you hand it in then? (Laugh)

VICTOR	(Reactions)… Yes, but it’s a wonder I’m still standing...

BOHEME	(Reaction) Victor! It’s beautiful, I couldn’t resist the temptation of trying it on. It fits like a glove.

VICTOR	No, professor, don’t move...

REBECCA	Aaaaaa

AINA	Aaaaaa

BOHEME	VICTOOOOOR

VICTOR	Boheme was really angry ...and that’s how I learn to do things in a hurry! Maybe it’s better..oh, no, the bell... byeeee
