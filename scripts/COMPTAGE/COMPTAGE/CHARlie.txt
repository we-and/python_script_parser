LESLIE	LESLIE	, but I’m Lulu. 

PAT	And I’m Katie. I guess I think I would be interested in studying the women of the Pioneer. 

LESLIE	That’s what we were doing with Charlie.

LESLIE	Learning how to live off the land and be self sufficient.

CHARLIE	I asked. Now that's a good soldier. 

CHARLIE	Be my mirror. 

CHARLIE	My name's Charlie. 

CHARLIE	(laughter) Where did you find her? 

BOBBY	She was hanging around my harem for a while. 

BOBBY	But it was turning into a bad scene with my old lady. 

CHARLIE	Beautiful Brother Bobby. He really knows how to make…

CHARLIE	love to the girls. That’s what they all tell me.Sadie's made love to Bobby, right? 

SUSAN	Yeah, we've all made love to him at this point, huh?  

CHARLIE	I can't…

CHARLIE	take another man’s woman. 

BOBBY	She’s not mine, Charlie. 

LESLIE	Gypsy told me all about you and the family. 

CHARLIE	I can't take her. 

PAT	Charlie. I think we should let her stay. 

PAT	She digs us, and she's hungry. 

PAT	She’s a seeker. 

CHARLIE	Where are your parents?

LESLIE	It doesn’t matter to me. I am on my own journey.

CHARLIE	Well…

CHARLIE	what do you have for us? Do you have a car?

LESLIE	No. 

CHARLIE	Well, then we'll get you one. 

CHARLIE	We'll get you a car. 

CHARLIE	We'll find you a car. 

CHARLIE	You know why because old ego is a too much thing. Old ego is a too much thing. He'll make you fool yourself. You'll think you're somebody else. You'll ride that whole subway train. 

CHARLIE	You like her...

CHARLIE	you teach her, Katie. 

CHARLIE	You keep an eye on her, and you see if she belongs with us. And you...

CHARLIE	Katie is my everything. Katie is me. You pay attention to what she does. If you are even half as good as her…

CHARLIE	then you can stay. 

PAT	When I first met Charlie, I just knew. I hopped on a bus, and I never looked back. 

PAT	Charlie's like a...beacon of light or something. I mean look at you, you're here. 

PAT	Hey, Tex. 

TEX	How you doing? 

PAT	Tex hasn’t reached awareness yet. He's still working on letting go of his ego. CHARLIE says...

PAT	to let go of your ego and be like a…finger on a hand. Come on. I want you to meet George. George Spahn. It's his ranch. 

PAT	Hello? 

PAT	Squeaky is so kind to him. She’s a generous soul.

LESLIE	I’ll say.

PAT	It’s beautiful here. We don’t get hung up about sex, you get it? We just be. We let things happen. We let go. I think you're gonna love it. 

CHARLIE	Hurry up now. You guys come on. 

PAT	Dennis! 

DENNIS	Hey, girl. 

DENNIS	And who is this pretty thing?

LESLIE	I’m LESLIE	.

DENNIS	Welcome. I’m not in this family, but…

DENNIS	I dig this family. Hi.

LESLIE	Beach Boys Dennis? That’s really DENNISWilson?

PAT	He's just DENNISto us!

PAUL	Time for communion.

PAT	You’ve turned on before, right?

LESLIE	Millions of times. Just uh, wasn’t expecting it

LESLIE	right now. 

CHARLIE	I spent…

CHARLIE	my life in jail for you. So that you could ride your bicycles. Have your birthday parties. I never had a life. 

CHARLIE	I don’t even know what life is. But you all had...a life. Your parents told you what to do and you did it. And for payment you got what? You got little cookie cutter minds. 

CHARLIE	Look what happened to Sandy. 

CHARLIE	Spoiled Sandy. 

CHARLIE	Spoiled Sandy had to come to her new Daddy to find something real.

CHARLIE	Take off your clothes...

CHARLIE	for us Sandy.

CHARLIE	Do it.

CHARLIE	Help her. Come on. Can't you see she needs help? 

CHARLIE	Tex. 

CHARLIE	Get up here. 

CHARLIE	Go on. 

CHARLIE	Now you look at how…

CHARLIE	parents abuse their children. If they loved her, why did they allow doctors to cut up her body like this? 

CHARLIE	And then they felt bad and then they spoiled her. 

CHARLIE	And now Sandy can’t let go of her ego. It’s not your fault, it’s your parents’ fault. 

CHARLIE	Say that to me. 

SANDY	It's my parents' fault. 

CHARLIE	It's not your fault. 

SANDY	It's not my fault. 

CHARLIE	Now turn around. It's not...

CHARLIE	your fault. 

SANDY	It's not my fault. 

CHARLIE	It's your parents' fault. 

SANDY	It's my…parents' fault. 

CHARLIE	Now come and tell her that she looks beautiful. 

GIRL	You look beautiful, Sandy. 

SQUEAKY	Perfect.

SUSAN	You look beautiful. 

GIRLS ALL TALKING AT ONCE	You look beautiful. So beautiful.

SINGER	Now more than you do Can you go and get everything that you 

SINGER	Ah ah 

CHARLIE	You are beautiful, Sandy. 

LESLIE	So he led Katie away, and I asked Squeaky if Katie was Charlie’s old lady. And Squeaky told me “Nobody belongs to anybody here."

LESLIE	Except Charlie.

LESLIE	We all belong to Charlie.” 

LESLIE	I thought that was pretty far out. 

LESLIE	Then she says “If you’re lucky he’ll pick you next." 

LESLIE	Every girl should have a Daddy like Charlie.”

KARLENE	Something for you to take a look at…

KARLENE	for next week

LESLIE	The Bible is the only book Charlie…

LESLIE	let us have around.

PAT	CHARLIEsays that authors are evil.

PAT	Trying to play mind tricks on the readers.

KARLENE	So do you feel like you would be doing something bad…

KARLENE	by studying with me? Because if...

KARLENE	you are going to do these classes with me, you’re going to have to read books. 

KARLENE	I’m also going to leave…

KARLENE	a copy of this. Have any of you read it?

KARLENE	This book changed my life. 

PAT	It looks like it could be interesting.

KARLENE	Can you believe Charles Manson wouldn't let them read? 

KARLENE	It's been 3 years since they had…

KARLENE	any contact with him. But all they do is talk about him  and spout his...

KARLENE	bullshit. 

KARLENE	I want you to come talk to them. You should do your poetry workshop. 

VICKI	No way. 

VICKI	There are...

VICKI	real victims in this prison. They're the ones I want to help. 

KARLENE	Maybe these women are victims too. 

GLORIA	Would you be saying that if it was your sister? 

GLORIA	Your pregnant sister who got stabbed 20 times. 

JIMMY	It's LESLIE's shower time, so it's your time in the yard, Pat. 

JIMMY	And Susan…

JIMMY	I guess it’s just gonna be you and me for a bit.

SUSAN	Perfect...

SUSAN	opportunity for a hand job.

SUSAN	Just teasing, Jimmy. I know...

SUSAN	you love your Alice!

JIMMY	Oh, there you go. Wow. 

JIMMY	The tomatoes are looking great.

PAT	We’ll give you some when they are ripe!

CHARLIE	(singing) Time keeps on flying You think you're lovin' baby But all you do is try

CHARLIE	(singing) Can you feel 

CHARLIE	(singing) And your feeling's real 
CHARLIE	(singing) Inaudible) 

PAT	Good morning. 

PAT	Charlie's sending us on a garbage run to LA today. You're coming with me. He says you can split at the end of the day and go on your way if you want to.

CHARLIE	your calendars. I know that was difficult, but where did it get us? 

CHARLIE	You, do you feel more free? 

PAT	Yes, Charlie. 

CHARLIE	Why is that, Katie? 

PAT	I'm living in the now. 

CHARLIE	Mm-hmm. 

PAT	I don't need a soulless gadget to tell me how to live. I don't want to be like the plastic people. 

CHARLIE	That's what our parents and our schools taught us. Live by these numbers. Play by these rules. That time is over. I'm here to make the new rules, and the new rules are no rules. 

WOMAN	Oh, yeah. 

CHARLIE	I think it's time for us to give you a name. 

CHARLIE	Now what is it those uh, those people named you, the ones you occupied a house with and call a family? 

LESLIE	LESLIE	.

CHARLIE	See, what we're trying to do here is…

CHARLIE	we're trying to break down inhibitions. We're trying to live in our bodies. 

CHARLIE	Touch each other. Touch yourselves. 

CHARLIE	It is not a foreign country. 

CHARLIE	Your body's like a plant. If you don't give it love...
CHARLIE	it will die. 

CHARLIE	A little birdie...

CHARLIE	told me Tex here doesn't know how to give head. 

CHARLIE	To me, man, that's…that's a crime. 

TEX	Come on, Charlie. 

CHARLIE	Don't get uptight, man. I want my family to know each other in every way. We got no secrets. We got no shame. It's not your fault...

CHARLIE	that no one taught you.

CHARLIE	Well, looky...

CHARLIE	here, man. 

CHARLIE	Dude was always talking about 

CHARLIE	oral fixations. I mean, we all got 'em.  

CHARLIE	Cat was right. You need to suck...

CHARLIE	on something. That's why you got a mouth. That's why women got titties. 

CHARLIE	You see kids? They're always sucking on their thumbs or their fingers. 

CHARLIE	Or they're chewing on suckers or jawbreakers. 

CHARLIE	And people are always sticking pickles or smokes and zuzus in their face, you dig? Point is, Tex...

CHARLIE	if you're gonna suck on something...

CHARLIE	you better be fucking good at it, man. 

CHARLIE	Gypsy, you get your fine ass up here now. Come on now.

SQUEAKY	It's okay. 

CHARLIE	Don't get uptight about Sandy, man.  She's having an ego death. What...

CHARLIE	trying to do here, man, is submit. Let go. Get rid of materialistic culture of hangups. You dig? We're all about love here. Except sometimes, there has to be some death itself. 

CHARLIE	Changes, tears.  

CHARLIE	Weird trips. That's how it is. 

CHARLIE	That's how it's always been. 

CHARLIE	That's cool. You're not into it. That's okay. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do here. That's notthat's not what we're about. Let's just go back.

CHARLIE	Little girl listen to me, If you want to break free...

CHARLIE	of the bad experiences and inhibitions that are crushing you, you have to imagine that you are making love to your daddy, OK? That’s what all girls want and can never have. 

KARLENE	Ladies…

KARLENE	we have our own special cell…

KARLENE	for school now. I'm not sure what you all did...

KARLENE	to make Miss Carlson like you so much, but she…

KARLENE	but she gave the okay.

KARLENE	Let's talk about...

KARLENE	this one. 

KARLENE	Did you all read it? 

LESLIE	It was…

LESLIE	horrible. 

PAT	It was very depressing. I feel really bad for the women in those situations. 

KARLENE	A lot of women right here in this prison...

KARLENE	are survivors of domestic violence. They defended themselves...

KARLENE	and this is where it landed them. 

LESLIE	That is so sad. That makes me really sad. Are you friends with them? 

LESLIE	Do you help them? 

KARLENE	Yes. And yes. I’m working with a woman now who's trying not to let her daughter be put into foster care. She killed her abusive husband. She went to prison, and now her kid has no parents.

LESLIE	And what does your husband do? 

KARLENE	As much as I'd love to...

KARLENE	talk about me, I am here to teach you, and I am not a subject that merits a college class. 

LESLIE	I feel so lucky.

CHARLIE	look at her piggie face. 

CHARLIE	You see that, Lulu. 

CHARLIE	Not every stupid hippie girl can waltz onto my land and get a free dinner. I need to see something in your eyes.

CHARLIE	Keep reading. 

LESLIE	And it came out of the smoke, locusts on the earth. 

CHARLIE	The Beatles. 

LESLIE	And unto them was given power.

CHARLIE	Me. 

LESLIE	The one that's given the earth has power.

LESLIE	And it was commanded that they should not hurt the grass of the earth...

SQUEAKY	I have wings. And I can fly now. 

LESLIE	CHARLIEsays there's gonna be a revolution. And we're gonna wait it out in the bottomless pit. 

LESLIE	Like it says in Revelations. 

PAT	And that there will be...

PAT	babies that are homeless and they need saving from all the killings.

SUSAN	And that we’ll stay underground…

SUSAN	and make music, and make love until the violence is over.

PAT	And that when  it comes time for us to rise to the surface again, some of us will begin to feel budding wings on our backs.

KARLENE	Wings?

LESLIE	thinks we’re crazy.

KARLENE	No. 

KARLENE	I would never use that word. I’m just surprised to hear some of this stuff. 

KARLENE	You have to admit it’s pretty far out.

KARLENE	You must know that elves are mythical creatures, and therefore human beings can’t turn into elves, or sprout wings?

SUSAN	Well, hey, man, it’s no more far out than heaven and hell. 

PAT	Yeah. CHARLIEsays that

LESLIE	Yeah…

LESLIE	well, what do YOU think? 

LESLIE	Pat, do you…

LESLIE	still think it’s possible….

LESLIE	that you will become a winged elf?

PAT	Well I guess not now. 
PAT	Notnot when we're in here.

KARLENE	You won't become a winged elf…

KARLENE	whether you're in here or out in the world.

LESLIE	Karlene…

LESLIE	tell us about your kids. Pretty please? 

LESLIE	What are their names? How old are they? We spend too much time talking about us in here. 

KARLENE	They are 15, 14…

KARLENE	11 and 7. 

LESLIE	You have a 7 year old? 

LESLIE	He must miss you so much!

KARLENE	I see him...

KARLENE	every weekend. 

LESLIE	I…

LESLIE	didn’t mean it like that.

LESLIE	I took my family…

LESLIE	all around the world. To Germany, to France, to Ethiopia. 

LESLIE	We've been through a lot together and they are always surprising me. 

LESLIE	Mom, I have a new family now. 

LESLIE'S MOTHER	LESLIE	, what are you talking about? 

LESLIE'S MOTHER 	We're your parents. (crying)

LESLIE	Mom. 

LESLIE	Please stop crying. Listen to me. I need you to stop loving me. You're never going to see me again. 

CHARLIE	(singing) Your holy prayer

GYPSY	We were all way into our trips...

GYPSY	and hanging out inside the bus. When CHARLIE just decides, he has to go. He starts...

GYPSY	running down the road and we all start…

GYPSY	begging him to come back to us.“Charlie, Charlie! It was really scary. But…

GYPSY	we can all laugh about it now. 

LESLIE	Right at that moment, I was probably sitting in my...

LESLIE	secretarial school, freaking out but not even knowing it.

PAT	We don’t talk about our pasts. 

PAT	We don't have pasts. 

PAT	Our lives started when we met Charlie.

LESLIE	But...

LESLIE	CHARLIE talks about his time in prison

PAT	How dare you...

PAT	question Charlie? 

PAT	You need to talk less…

PAT	and listen more. 

GIRLS	Dennis!! 

GYPSY	Hi! 

LESLIE	Hi. 

GREG	Hey beautiful…

GREG	did you miss me? 

RUTH ANN	No, we’ve been busy lots going on here. CHARLIE wants

GREG	Oh, CHARLIE CHARLIE Charlie! Lets talk about…

GREG	what Greg wants.

CHARLIE	What does Greg want? 

CHARLIE	Stand up girls, lets give the…

CHARLIE	guys what they want.

DENNIS	You’re all beautiful…

DENNIS	but right now I just want to get high and play music.

CHARLIE	Come on then, the girls are always here. Let’s go play.

DENNIS	I came to tell you something…

DENNIS	Charlie. I talked the band into recording your song…

DENNIS	Cease to Exist- everyone likes it, man. 

CHARLIE	That's far out. 

DENNIS	I can't promise more than that though. We'll just see how it works out. 

CHARLIE	(singing) Pretty girl, Pretty pretty girl I'll cease to exist I'll be a rock star.  Alright, man. 

GYPSY	Hey, Charlie. This is...

GYPSY	Linda. 

CHARLIE	Hey, there. 

CHARLIE	Looky, looky here. 

CHARLIE	Where's that baby's daddy? 

LINDA	We split. He went sailing around the world or something. 

CHARLIE	Take that...

CHARLIE	to be with the other little kiddies here. 

CHARLIE	Tex tells me that you have a car?

CHARLIE	Alright. I think we can keep her. 

LESLIE	Let me…

LESLIE	show you around. 

LESLIE	Don't worry. Ruth Ann is great...

LESLIE	with the kids. And just think, if you're loyal to Charlie, she will always be taken care of. Here everything belongs to everyone. 

LESLIE	Gypsy tells me you had a far out session making it with Tex. 

LINDA	Yeah. 

LINDA	When we came my, my fists were clenched at my sides. My arms were paralyzed. 

LESLIE	That's your ego dying. 

LINDA	Is that bad? To have your ego dying? 

LESLIE	No. That's what Charlie's trying to help us do. Kill our egos. Be one consciousness. 

LESLIE'S MOTHER	Love you, sweetheart. 

GUARD	Come on. Let's go. 

PAT	What…happened? Is your mom okay? 

LESLIE	Oh, she's fine. (crying)

LESLIE	I just can't stand it. She might think I ended up in here...

LESLIE	because of something they did or the way that they raised me. 

PAT	No one has visited her. 

PAT	The whole three years. 

LESLIE	I told my mother to stop...

LESLIE	loving me. Because she would never see me again. She kept loving me anyway. 

CHARLIE	Now listen up. I want everyone to show my...

CHARLIE	good friend Phil here a lot of love tonight. Because…

CHARLIE	he’s my jailhouse brother. We were at San Quentin together. So Katie, why don't you come and make the man feel welcome!

SINGER	(singing) I feel much better on the other side 

PHIL	Well, look at that. You  know we all thought...

PHIL	he was fucking crazy in prison. 

PHIL	Talked a lot…

PHIL	of nonsense.

PHIL	Maybe I should’ve listened.

CHARLIE	Now my good friend DENNIS here has an announcement to make. 

DENNIS	Uh…

DENNIS	yeah, Charlie's song “Cease to Exist” is on the record. 

CHARLIE	All you need to do is…

CHARLIE	get your friend Terry Melcher...

CHARLIE	to come up here and listen to me play and I...

CHARLIE	know he'll want to sign us. 

DENNIS	I’ll do my best to get him out here.

CHARLIE	That's right. 

CHARLIE	(inaudible) Thanks. Now, Katie. Get everyone together. Tell them just stop what they're doing right now, and come here. 

PAT	Okay. 

CHARLIE	Soon. Now. 

CHARLIE	Terry Melcher is coming to hear me play.

CHARLIE	So we need to be ready. I mean, we need to be more than ready. Terry Melcher. 

CHARLIE	Terry Melcher! Come on. 

CHARLIE	Dennis's producer. The guy who can give me a record deal, goddammit. 

SQUEAKY	Yeah.

CHARLIE	When Terry hears...

CHARLIE	me play, he's gonna lose his mind, which means the world gets to hear my music.

CHARLIE	And then all the lost young loves...

CHARLIE	during the mayhem and the killing will hear my music, and they will know that they have a home. 

CHARLIE	So guys, make this place look spotless. Get rid of all...

CHARLIE	the stuff that stinks. And girls, you bake some cookies. 

CHARLIE	And go to the grocery store. I don't want no...

CHARLIE	garbage run food for Terry. And I want a deer skin shirt and pants held together by laces. I want...

CHARLIE	him to see my commitment to going back to the land. 

LESLIE	But don't they have to kill the deer for that? 

CHARLIE	Who has a question? Would you like to repeat that Lulu? 

LESLIE	Don't they…kill the deer? 

CHARLIE	What we have here…

CHARLIE	What we have here is a contradiction. Lulu thinks she sees a contradiction and her tiny female...

CHARLIE	brain is gonna have a freak out. If you...

CHARLIE	think I’m going against my own words...

CHARLIE	then maybe you just aren't involved enough yet to understand what's...

CHARLIE	going on.

CHARLIE	Old JC said a lot of...

CHARLIE	things his followers didn't understand. And they stuck around.

CHARLIE	No sense makes sense. You dig? 

CHARLIE	(singing) I think your lovin' baby 

CHARLIE	(singing) But all your doin' is trying

CHARLIE	(singing) You can feel 

CHARLIE	(singing) Are those feelings real Look at your

CHARLIE	game girl 

CHARLIE	Look at your game girl  

Chorus	Say la  no, no, no. Again, again, again, again, again. Until we get it right on the night. 

CHARLIE	Again. We need to do it again. This is Terry Melcher. Again. 

GIRLS	Again. 

CHARLIE	Again. 

GIRLS	Again.

CHARLIE	Again. 

GIRLS	Again.

CHARLIE	Again.

GIRLS	(singing) Oooh 

CHARLIE	(singing) Livin' in that confusion

CHARLIE	Frustration and doubt

CHARLIE	Can you ever live without the game We don't have enough of a spectacle. Again. 

CHARLIE	Again. 

SQUEAKY	Sounds…

SQUEAKY	good, Charlie. 

CHARLIE	I didn't ask for your opinion. I asked for your titties and your shapes. 

CHARLIE	I know it sounds good. 

CHARLIE	Chorus! 

CHARLIE	(singing) What a mad delusion

GIRLS	(singing) Oooh 

CHARLIE	(singing) Livin' that confusion Frustration and doubt

CHARLIE	So what do you think of our place, man? I mean, we dig it here, you know. We learn it's possible.

CHARLIE	to live without restrictions. I mean, dig it, we live on other people's.

CHARLIE	garbage. And we live well, you know

TERRY	Hey, Charlie, man. Let's take a walk. Talk about the music. 

CHARLIE	Alright, man. 

CHARLIE	You know, I mean, look, we get off into these trees, we go walking. Gotta take the horses out, you know? 

TERRY	Yeah, so uh…

PAT	That was perfect. So beautiful. 

PAT	You…

PAT	girls made me cry, your voices were so sweet. 

SQUEAKY	It's all happening.

SQUEAKY	Finally...

SQUEAKY	the world gets to hear Charlie's music. 

SUSAN	More popular than Jesus.

LESLIE	That suit looks outasite. 

LESLIE	He looks like a rock star already. 

PAUL	Well, man…

PAUL	What did he say? 

SQUEAKY	He looked like he was really digging it. 

PAT	Is he going to sign you...

PAT	like he should? 

CHARLIE	I mean, he gave me money. 

PAT	How much is it? 

CHARLIE	I couldn't…

CHARLIE	sign a contract on the spot. That's just not how CHARLIE Manson operates. My word is my bond. I don't need no written contract.

PAUL	But what about that money? 

CHARLIE	It's just hay money. I'm sure he wanted the horses to eat well. 

CHARLIE	You know, let's eat some of the...

CHARLIE	cookies those motherfuckers didn't want.

CHARLIE	Who made this salad dressing?

SUSAN	I did.

CHARLIE	Oh. Smells a little bit like piss.


SUSAN	Well…that's 'cause I pissed in yours.

CHARLIE	Don't say…

CHARLIE	that shit to me, woman!

CHARLIE	Look at me! Look at me! 

CHARLIE	I will not listen…

CHARLIE	to that kind of talk. You take that shit down the road. You dig what I'm saying? Look at me. 

CHARLIE	Look at me. Look at me in the eye. Me in the eye. 

CHARLIE	What? You want to hit me? 

SUSAN	Fuck you! 

CHARLIE	Get the fuck out of here. 

CHARLIE	You want to fucking hit me? 

SUSAN	(yells) No! 

CHARLIE	Huh? Huh? 

CHARLIE	I will break…

CHARLIE	your fucking wrist. I will break your fucking...

CHARLIE	fingers!

CHARLIE	What? What? Stop fighting! 

CHARLIE	Stop fighting me. 

CHARLIE	You stop fuckingstop fighting me.  Whoa… whoa…whoa. Quit fighting me.

CHARLIE	Get up. Now go back in the kitchen and go, go about your business. 

PAT	You can go ahead and eat, Sandy. 

LESLIE	Hey. Are you OK?

SUSAN	Oh yeah. Yeah, I feel good. Listen. Getting hit by the man you love is no different than making love to him. CHARLIE just gives me what I need.

KARLENE	I brought you gifts. 

LESLIE	I love the way new books smell. 

PAT	Thank you so much. 

LESLIE	We have a Christmas...

LESLIE	present for you. Did you bring it, Katie? 

LESLIE	Sadie did this. 

LESLIE	The sun. 

PAT	And that's a butterfly. Lulu did it. 

PAT	It's just like the one we made for Charlie. 

CHARLIE	Ready, baby girl? 

CHARLIE	I got this. 

CHARLIE	You see that? She trusts me. 

CHARLIE	She's not afraid. 

CHARLIE	You'd die for me, wouldn't you, girl? 

PAT	Of course, Charlie. 

SUSAN	You uh, got a knife for me? 

SINGER	You're gonna wake up one morning As the sun meets the dawn 

SINGER	You're gonna wake up 

SINGER	One morning 

CHARLIE	Straight Satan gods. 

CHARLIE	I think we need them. 

CHARLIE	Tex…

CHARLIE	tells me he got into a little...

CHARLIE	complication with a Black man. 

CHARLIE	It might come back on him...

CHARLIE	so I want you to make them feel welcome. 

CHARLIE	Give them your gift. Show them a good time. 

SUSAN	CHARLIE doesn't like us to do speed. 	

DANNY	Well, CHARLIE can't see us right now. 

DRIVER	Where you headed? 

TEX	Anywhere but here. 

CHARLIE	This album is a musical roadmap to our future. 

CHARLIE	Now when he talks about the piggies, he's talking about the rich and the powerful needing a damn good whacking. The Blackbird. It's the Black man's time to rise. And Revolution 1, it's a call to arms. It's time. Revolution 9, it's the soundtrack to the war. 

CHARLIE	It's guns. Screaming. 

CHARLIE	Does that make you feel afraid? 

SANDY	No. 

SANDY	It's like you always said it would be. 

CHARLIE	You're damn straight it's like I always said it would be. You should feel proud. 

CHARLIE	You should all feel proud. And why should you all feel proud? 

CHARLIE	Lulu, why? 

LESLIE	Because we're already living like revolutionaries. 

CHARLIE	Yes! Now dig this. 

CHARLIE	In Revelations, in the bible, it talks about the locusts coming to earth. Now that's the Beatles. 

CHARLIE	And he talks about the locusts having scales like iron breastplates. That's the Beatles' guitars. And dig this...

CHARLIE	he talks about 5 angels coming to earth. Now this 5 angels, 4 of them are the Beatles, the other one is  me. And the other one is me because I am given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit. And where...

CHARLIE	is the bottomless pit? 

PAT	The one you told us about in Death Valley? The one we're going to find. 

CHARLIE	Yes! So...

CHARLIE	Helter Skelter is the thing, man. It's what the Black man's gonna do...

CHARLIE	to start the race war! But just like the Bible says, I will lead my...

CHARLIE	family to the bottomless pit...

CHARLIE	and we will live out the war underground, and...

CHARLIE	we will expand to 144,000...

CHARLIE	and then we will come back like the...

CHARLIE	12 tribes of Israel, and when we come back, the Black man will not know how to act. Or how to be. Or how to govern. Or what to do! And so we cannot leave! We cannot leave because you're White people. And you will be murdered. You will be made into Black slaves...

CHARLIE	and Tex, Tex, Tex is gonna be sorry that he ever left our tribe.  

KARLENE	Thanks for coming out here. 

BILL	That's okay. Hey, look. My wife just wants to know all about these crazy Manson girls. 

KARLENE	Yeah. I get asked about them a lot.

BILL	Yeah. 

BILL	Okay, now you were all just kids when the Watts riots happened, but here's a perfect example. Now here you have Black Americans, oppressed for generations, at the end of their rope. Yeah…
BILL	things got out of hand back then, but the message was sent.

PAT	Yeah, CHARLIEsays Watts was the…

PAT	beginning. I really think that a race war…

PAT	would have started if they hadn’t put us in here. 

SUSAN	The Black man is rising up…

SUSAN	and his time is coming. 

SUSAN	Do you think it’s still coming?

BILL	Um…well, BOBBYSeale was bound and gagged in a courtroom, but last year they let him go. So…

SUSAN	We don’t know who that is.

BILL	Black Panthers? 

BILL	Y'all don’t get any news in here at all?

PAT	Yes. 

PAT	We know the Black Panthers! CHARLIEsaid that Black people wouldn’t be able to lead themselves after the revolution that they would need his help. 

BILL	Yeah, I heard that he said that. 

PAT	It's okay. He said…

PAT	that you wouldn’t understand now, but that you would thank him later.

BILL	But…(sighs) 

LESLIE	You don't…

LESLIE	think that’s true?

BILL	I find that to be a…

BILL	deeply racist idea. That Black people would need a…

BILL	White man to tell them what to think? When Black…

BILL	people take their power back, there’s no chance in hell that 

PAT	CHARLIEsays

LESLIE	Let’s…

LESLIE	listen to what BILLhas to say.

BILL	There's no chance in hell that we would turn to a White person for leadership. Black people were brought here as slaves in 1619, and even after slavery and the eventual abolishment of slavery, we are still…

BILL	getting crushed by racism. 

BILL	We don't…

BILL	trust the White men…

BILL	and we certainly don’t need one to lead us. You hear me?

CHARLIE	The trouble with Blackie is, he wants to fuck…

CHARLIE	all the white women, turn all the white babies brown. We can't have that. That's what makes Whitey mad.We're gonna help Blackie out. We're gonna start a race war called Helter Skelter. We're gonna start this war by killing some White people and making it look like the Black man's work. Blackie's been waiting for this. Blackie is just waiting. And then the piggy cops will come down on Blackie when they find the rich dead piggies. Then the revolution will begin. You understand me? Helter Skelter is upon us. 

PAT	Lulu? 

PAT	What's wrong? 

LESLIE	Did you ever start…

LESLIE	to think that maybe Helter Skelter isn’t coming down at all? That CHARLIE was wrong?

PAT	No. No! 

PAT	Don’t let this place get to you. It would be happening right now if we weren’t in here. Please don’t give up now.

LESLIE	OK.

PAT	Because I need you!

LESLIE	I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.

CHARLIE	Lulu. 

CHARLIE	This knife might be the only thing between you and Blackie slitting your throat. Thrust and jab like you mean it. Thrust. Jab. Lift. 

CHARLIE	Stab the chair. 

CHARLIE	Good, Mary. 

PAT	I know everyone thinks…

PAT	we’re these scary creatures who committed these horrible crimes, but we were just engaging in the dance of life and death. CHARLIEsays there is no death.

KARLENE	So you’re saying it’s OK to take someone’s life? LESLIE	? Susan? Is that what you think?

SUSAN	No. I’m saying that I’m starting to think that the Devil took a hold of me so I could find my way to God. 

KARLENE	So CHARLIEis the Devil?

SUSAN	No. CHARLIEis Charlie, and the Devil is the Devil.

KARLENE	So you all still believe that thing he was talking about - “Helter Skelter”?

LESLIE	The other night…

LESLIE	I started to doubt it, and I got shaky. 

KARLENE	You felt doubt.

KARLENE	What made you feel that doubt?

PAT	That was just for a minute, right, Lulu? She doesn’t doubt anymore.

VIRGINIA	Sorry to interrupt your studies, ladies. I am afraid I have bad news. The decision has come down, and you will remain here in SSU for the duration of your sentences. 

SUSAN	Fuck these fucking motherfuckers! They can’t fucking do this shit to us! We’re fucking...

SUSAN	human beings!! 

VIRGINIA	You…

VIRGINIA	are considered an escape risk and too well known.  

PAT	We're never going to see CHARLIEagain.

LESLIE	We don't know what's going to happen. There's always parole. You could get out. 

PAT	No. You. You could get out. 

PAT	They'll never let me out of here. It's my fault you're...

PAT	in here. CHARLIEsaid make sure everyone does something that night, and I made sure you did. 

PAT	You must hate me. 

LESLIE	I could never hate you. 

KARLENE	Good…

KARLENE	afternoon, ladies. A special treat for you today - no…

KARLENE	school just a mini concert!

KARLENE	Ladies? I brought Robin to

KARLENE	play for you

KARLENE	Ladies, why would you do this?

PAT	CHARLIE spoke to us last night. He told us to.

LESLIE	He told us to protest. 

KARLENE	Jesus fucking Christ.

VICKI	How the hell…

VICKI	did they get razors?

KARLENE	The guards love them. They have all kinds of things in their cells.

GLORIA	Are you OK? 

KARLENE	It's just as long as they're stuck...

KARLENE	alone together in that unit just repeating their brainwashing back to each other...

VICKI 	I mean, they're never gonna see the real world again. So...

VICKI	what is it we can really do forthem?

KARLENE	I just want to remind them...

KARLENE	if I can, of who they were before they ever met Charles Manson. 

KARLENE	I just want to give them back themselves.

STEVE SOMEWHERE	Let’s go take a walk.

LESLIE	Where’s Charlie?

PAT	He went somewhere with Paul.

PAT	Seems like he's been gone forever.

STEVE SOMEWHERE	You like living here?

LESLIE	Yeah. You should join us.

STEVE SOMEWHERE	Nah, I need my freedom.

LESLIE	Freedom! That’s all we have here.

STEVE SOMEWHERE	I like you. You should come away on adventures with me.

LESLIE	I have a lot of responsibilities here. We’re preparing for a war!

STEVE SOMEWHERE	Well if we’re all gonna die, we better get to making love, right?

LESLIE	Well I don’t know about that.

STEVE SOMEWHERE	You might be my last chance, baby. 

CHARLIE	Hey. 

CHARLIE	Who the fuck are you?

STEVE SOMEWHERE	Sorry, man. I came...

STEVE SOMEWHERE	I came with DANNYand them guys.

CHARLIE	Just get the fuck outta...

CHARLIE	here and don’t you come back unless you’re invited. Which you wont be.

CHARLIE	Get up. Get out. You want me to...

CHARLIE	help get your dick in your pants? 

CHARLIE	Get the fuck outta my barn! 

STEVE SOMEWHERE	You guys got a weird scene...

STEVE SOMEWHERE	going on up here, man. 

CHARLIE	You ask me…

CHARLIE	first!! 

CHARLIE	You don't just whore...

CHARLIE	around. That is it. 

CHARLIE	No more hippie kids looking for a free ride and a quick lay. 

CHARLIE	Nobody has any visitors unless it goes through me. We need to stay focused on our scene.

CHARLIE	No more outsiders. 

CHARLIE	I'm gonna go on...

CHARLIE	an adventure. You can come. Bring Lulu. Bring that…

CHARLIE	Linda girl. We'll use her car. 

CHARLIE	We get in the rich people’s houses, and we get in their heads, you dig? 

CHARLIE	You just get in, and you get out.

CHARLIE	Don’t be afraid. Mess things up…

CHARLIE	a bit but don’t break anything. 

CHARLIE	Alright, take a wallet here and there. But mostly just let them know that they’re not safe.

LINDA	But what if they wake up?

CHARLIE	Don't allow them to.  Use your training, man.  Be invisible.

SANDY	He'll wake up and say, (she imitates a “square” voice) “Honey - where did I put my wallet?”

PAT	And he'll…

PAT	say, "Why did you put the portraiats upside down?"

CHARLIE	What’s in the wallet?

PAT	Um, uh, 60 bucks and 3 credit cards.

CHARLIE	Well, that's nothing. Next time we tie some Piggies up and we scare them to death.

STEVE SOMEWHERE	Lulu, I think you should leave here, and I came to help...

STEVE SOMEWHERE	you do that. 

STEVE SOMEWHERE	It looks like…

STEVE SOMEWHERE	you’re being made to stay here against your will.

STEVE SOMEWHERE	I can take you right now. 

STEVE SOMEWHERE	You can drop that broom, get on my bike, and we'll be gone.  Nobody will…

STEVE SOMEWHERE	stop us. 

LESLIE	No. I’m staying here. I want to be here. I mean...

LESLIE	thankthank you…

STEVE SOMEWHERE	Are you sure about this? I ain't expecting nothing from you. 

STEVE SOMEWHERE	I mean, we, we ain't got to ball just 'cause I get you out of here. 

STEVE SOMEWHERE	You just look like you need rescuing, that's all.

LESLIE	I’m sure.

STEVE SOMEWHERE	Let's go. 

CHARLIE	You want to leave me? 

CHARLIE	Jump. 

CHARLIE	That’s my Lulu. I knew you weren't going anywhere. 

KARLENE	Hi. 

VIRGINIA	How are you?

KARLENE	I’ve realized if I succeed…

KARLENE	in making them really accept what they did...

KARLENE	then they will have to live with that horror.

VIRGINIA	Isn’t that what prison's for? Atonement…

VIRGINIA	taking responsibility for one’s actions?

KARLENE	They will have to live with that horror every day..

KARLENE	for the rest of their lives. I’m opening the door…

KARLENE	to that torment. To the place where their punishment truly begins.

CHARLIE	I like the (inaudible). 

MAN	Yeah. Me too. 

CHARLIE	I like the little guy though. 

CHARLIE	Personal. 

TEX	It was just like you said it'd be out there. 

TEX	Plastic people everywhere. 

TEX	I belong here. With you. 

CHARLIE	Well, then get ready to fight.

CHARLIE	Now you...

CHARLIE	put the piggy in the chair. Who's the piggy? 

GIRLS	Who's the piggy? 

CHARLIE	Who's the piggy? 

GIRLS	Who's the piggy?

CHARLIE	Now we could tie him up, and we could scare the Piggy into willing us...

CHARLIE	all of his money, and we could kill his family in front of him…

CHARLIE	but I need you to give this gift to me. 

CHARLIE	Are you willing to die for me, Tex? 

CHARLIE	Are you willing to let me kill you? 

TEX	Yeah, Charlie. Sure, you can kill me.

TEX	Tex Watson is gone. He doesn't exist anymore.

TEX	Now there is just this.

TEX	A body named Tex that carries around a little piece of Charlie, a little piece of The Infinite.

CHARLIE	It's CHARLIE Manson, baby. 

CHARLIE	Yeah, for Terry. Yeah. Well, I can call back. But…yeah, man, I dig. That's cool. I can call back. That's no problem. Alright. You think I don't know you're there, Terry? You think I don't know you're there? I'll burn your fucking eyes out with this fucking cigarette. You fucking weasel fuck.

SHARON	Oh…

SHARON	Hello. Welcome. Do…

SHARON	I  know you? 

CHARLIE	Uh, no. 

CHARLIE	No, I'm just looking for Terry. 

CHARLIE	Terry Melcher. I been to a few parties here. 

JAY	Hey, have I met you before?

CHARLIE	No. 

SHARON	Well, um…

SHARON	Terry moved to Malibu, so he’s not here. But are you a friend of Terry's? 

SHARON	Please come in if you are. 

CHARLIE	No,  no. Thank you.

SHARON	Okay. Goodnight. 

CHARLIE	Goodnight.

SUSAN	Thank you.

JIMMY	Well of course.

ANNOUNCER	…world famous director Roman Polanski. Beautiful Sharon Tate had…

ANNOUNCER	no way of knowing of the horrific tragedy that would soon befall her. 

SHARON	I feel very alone at a party. On a set or in general. If I'm not in harmony with the things around me.

SHARON	I'm very sensitive to…

SHARON	ugly situations. I’m quick to read people and I pick up if someone's reacting to me as just a sexy blonde. Times like those, I freeze. 


SUSAN	Lord Jesus…

SUSAN	I open up the door to my heart. Please come in and...

SUSAN	forgive us. 

SUSAN	No! 

CHARLIE	Dig. 

CHARLIE	The time is now, man. Helter Skelter. You go into  Terry Melcher's old house…

CHARLIE	and you make it look like blackie’s work.

TEX	Couple of weeks ago, me and Mary went on an acid run...TEX	in Hollywood, you know. Even though they gave us this, this really special stuff called Orange Sunshine. 

TEX	And when we got outside…

TEX	we were convinced that we were invisible. 

TEX	Yeah. So we hitched a ride over the Canyon, right. And the DRIVER, all of a sudden, he just jerks around, and he starts screaming at us, you know. He's like, boy, what the fuck are you doing to my car? Huh. So…

TEX	we realized that we actually were invisible. And what CHARLIEsaid was true. 

TEX	And once you burn every thought out of…

TEX	your head (chuckles) there’s nothing left for anyone else to see.

TEX	So, we were...

TEX	staring into the setting sun.

TEX	It felt like we were looking…

TEX	right at God. You know, and I realized (sighs) I realized that the closer the sun got to setting,  the closer I knew the end of the world was. 

TEX	What CHARLIEsaid was true. 

TEX	The Apocalypse is at hand and the present world is dying. 

TEX	From then on, I haven't had a trace of doubt in my mind.

TEX	It’s coming down, and it's coming down fast.

SHARON	Please...please...just…

SHARON	take me with you. Please just let me live to…

SHARON	have my baby. 

SHARON	Please...

PAT	Kill her.

SHARON	No…

SHARON	…adorned with bright shiny things.

SHARON	I see that as something totally pure and beautiful.

INTERVIEWER	And what do you make of some of the dark subjects in your husband’s films?

SHARON	Everything that's realistic has some sort of ugliness in it. Even a flower is ugly when it wilts

LESLIE	Sadie, can you...

LESLIE	please turn it down? 

SHARON	…the ocean when it becomes violent.

PAT	Was…

PAT	informative, interesting…

PAT	but so graphic. 

PAT	I saw Lulu…

PAT	blushing when she was reading it.

LESLIE	I wasn’t.

SUSAN	Karlene, don’t take this the wrong way, but are you a lesbian?

SUSAN	This seems kind of like…

SUSAN	a lesbian book.

KARLENE	No, I’m not, Susan.

SUSAN	Oh. I'm sorry. 

SUSAN	And glad. It’s against the Lord’s way, and I would worry for you.

KARLENE	Well…

KARLENE	we will have to agree to disagree there. 

SUSAN	You can tell us if you are. I won’t pass judgment on you. It’s just that…

SUSAN	you dress that way, and you never talk about your husband... so…

KARLENE	My husband and I split up a year ago. I don’t like... talking about him much. He’s not a good man.

PAT	I never saw you as someone who would be with a bad man.

KARLENE	And there are a lot of things about all of you…

KARLENE	that I would never guess from looking at you. 

KARLENE	Like did you…

KARLENE	really believe that you were going to find an underground cave…

KARLENE	and live that way during the…

KARLENE	revolution? So much of what you’ve…

KARLENE	told me doesn’t make logical sense. How…

KARLENE	would you survive in a cave?

LESLIE	We wanted to believe something big was going to happen. 

LESLIE	I mean, do you remember in 1969, it really felt like…

LESLIE	there was going to be a huge cosmic…

LESLIE	shift, and things…

LESLIE	were never going to be the same?

LESLIE	Like there was…

LESLIE	gonna  be some big thing that was going to change everything? 

LESLIE	Come on Karlene, you were there…

LESLIE	didn’t it feel that way to you?

KARLENE	Yeah, it did. It felt that way to most people I know.  But it didn’t make them kill strangers.

LESLIE	But we had to. It was for…

KARLENE	For what? 

KARLENE	What was it for?

PAT	My hand hurts. 

PAT	The-the knife didn’t have a proper handle and it just kept hitting the bone.

LESLIE	So it’s all going down...

LESLIE	like CHARLIEsaid?

PAT	Yeah, it’s pretty heavy. But it’s like CHARLIE said…

PAT	if you love everything, then you don’t have to think about things, right?

LESLIE	Right on. What was it like? 

PAT	The people were very young. It didn’t seem right. But it was the right thing to do. 

PAT	CHARLIE asked me to do it, and I did it. No ego. No trip. 

PAT	CHARLIE taught us that Death and Life are the same thing so there's nothing to be afraid of. 

PAT	You can’t be afraid if you don’t exist. 

ROSEMARY	Honey, can you rub my feet, just for minute?

LENO	It’s always just for a minute.

LENO	That’ll be Cory letting us know she got in okay.

CHARLIE	Get up. 

CHARLIE	Stand over here. Last night was too messy.

CHARLIE	Tonight we’re going to go out,  and we're…

CHARLIE	going to get it right. Uh-huh. 

LESLIE	I want to go!

CHARLIE	You come along then.

CHARLIE	Well…there's two people in there. I got them ready for you. They're calm. Don't freak them out. Do something witchy. 

CHARLIE	Find your own way home. 

LENO	What are you gonna do? You're gonna kill us, aren't you? 


TEX	Did he…

TEX	say to kill them?

LENO	You're gonna kill us! 

LENO	Please, don't do this.   

LENO	Where's my wife? I have (inaudible) money at the store. Please. No! No! No! No! No! Rosemary! Rosemary!

LENO	No! I got money! 

LENO	I got money! 

LENO	I got money! I got money! 

ROSEMARY	What are you doing? 

TEX	Go take care of her. 

TEX	Go! 

ROSEMARY	Get away from me!! 

ROSEMARY	Get away!

ROSEMARY	Get away!

ROSEMARY	Somebody help us! Somebody help! No!	ROSEMARY	Get away! 

PAT	Tex!! 

ROSEMARY	No! No!

TEX	Come on now, Lulu. 

PAT	CHARLIE says everyone has to do something.

LESLIE	It was all for nothing. We did those horrible things for nothing.

PAT	Lulu…

PAT	We did what we had to do.

LESLIE	Call me LESLIE 	now please. 

LESLIE	My name is LESLIE	

LESLIE	We didn't...

LESLIE	have to do any of it. But we did. 

LESLIE	And why? 

LESLIE	Do you know why, Katie? 

LESLIE	Sadie? 

LESLIE	Why did we do those things?

LESLIE	Jimmy? 

LESLIE	JIMMY can I get out please? 

WOMEN	KARLENE Faith remained a friend to Patricia Krenwinkel and LESLIE	Van Houten and an advocate for their release until her death in 2017. KARLENEwanted it to be made clear that neither Patricia nor LESLIE	participated in the making of this film. After 5 years in the Special Security Unity, Patricia Krenwinkel, LESLIE	Van Houten, and Susan Atkins were finally released into the general populaton at the California Institution for Women. Susan Atkins remained a Born Again Christian for the rest of her life. She died in prison of brain cancer in 2009.Patricia Krenwinkel is still incarcerated at the California Institution for Women. By the late 1970s, she had renounced Charles Manson.I had to make the decsion that everything I had believed was now wrong. I would now have to be fully responsible for the damage, the wreckage and the horror. It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was part of. And it all came from such a simple thing as just wanting to be loved. -Patricia Krenwinkel, 2014 LESLIE	Van Houten remains in the California Institution for Women today.

SINGER	Peace of mind To find is not easy When the one you love you don't trust When I picture the image of someone else beside her I see a reflection of violence And emotion of life that is used Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooohhh Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooohhh I see a reflection of violence And emotion of life that is used You willl see That the mind cannnot furnish Things that you want were gone What can I see When the one thing that you had had passed Is not prety You want to love so hard But you bleed through every time 

SINGER	(singing) Frankincense and eucalyptus ring me into my mother's kitchen with rosaries, and crystal beads her pink heart bleeds out green money that she'll give to me I remember the day that I felt she was afraid of me dying I remember the day that I felt she was afraid of me living too Rosemary, Cotton, Dry linen My mother's body is the only One that I've ever lived in I remember the day that I felt she was afraid of me dying I remember the day that I felt she was afraid of me living too Coffee, toast, jam with butter I hear every word she utters and I can't wait to taste I remember the day that I felt she was afraid of me dying I remember the day that I felt she was afraid of me living too
