(CRYSTAL INFERNO)


STEELE	I hope this isnít going to be an,issue?

BEAUMONT	This isnít Detroit. Its Europe. You need to take a more subtle approach dealing with our problems.

STEELE	You hired me because I have a track record of solving problems, sometimes my methods are not conventional but thatís also why you hired me. You have over fifty million Euros on the line in this project, my job is to make sure that happens.

BEAUMONT	I appreciate your dedication. I assume it was all satisfactory.

HOFF	Are you making a joke?

BEAUMONT	Not at all... What seems to be the problem?

HOFF	Bribery Mister Beaumont.

BEAUMONT	Bribery? I am insulted at the insinuation, who are you accusing?

HOFF	I intend to find out. Your associate here- Alluded to a substantial sum to ignore serious problems in your electrical installations- I am not sure how things operate in the United States but here we have integrity in our construction practices.

ERIC	I merely offered to compensate you for any penalties that we may have to facilitate your approval.

HOFF	You really think Iím that kind of person?

ERIC	Eveline please, I really want to work with you, not against you.

BEAUMONT	Madame, I apologize for Mister Steeleís poor communication skills.
 
HOFF	I understand him perfectly. Thus I want to be clear that I will be reporting your business practices to the authorities.

BEAUMONT	I donít think we should be so hasty-

HOFF	Good day sirs.

ERIC	Ms. Hoff, let me take you downstairs.

HOFF	No, thank you. I know the way.

ERIC	Except that I have the elevator safety key.

BEAUMONT	Sheís emailing-

STEELE	Cell phone jammer. I don't leave anything to chance Mister Beaumont.

ERIC	Sorry it didnít work out.
 
BEAUMONT	Oh my God.

ERIC	Such a lovely day...

JAMES	Come on you canít be bored with the city yet. So much to see and do... The Rubens House, the Van den Bergh Museum, St. Paulís...
 
TOM	Are you kidding me? The kids canít stand that stuff. Well, maybe Anne would.

JAMES	Yeah I hear ya. Canít stand all that tourist nonsense either. Wish theyíd just tear it all down and let us build it right. Weíd make a killing. How about the Zoo?

TOM	Reminds me too much of my day to day existence.

JAMES	Hello Darkness! Whatís going on with you and Brianna? Married bliss wearing thin? Honeymoon over?

TOM	The honeymoon was fifteen years ago, remember?

JAMES	Is it that long? Told you Iíd be there for you, remember?

TOM	Easy brother, Iím not looking for an expensive divorce lawyer. We just need to sort ourselves out.

JAMES	Expensive?! Come on, Iíll give you a discount, you know that!
 
TOM	No itís just... Sheís on the road all the time, really focused on her work... Sometimes I feel like thereís no room for ‘us.í

JAMES	Sure she doesnít have something on the side?

TOM	Look, that's not exactly what I need to hear right now.

JAMES	Itís the number one reason spouses go cold.

TOM	James, please shut up.

JAMES	All right, all right but do you even know what, or who sheís doing right now in Paris, city of lovers?
 
BRIANNA	In conclusion, the UBX Tower built by Beaumont and Associates is designed to be the most energy efficient as well as safest buildings on the market today.

BEAUMONT	Wonderful.

GRANGER	Well, thank you very much Brianna, that means a lot coming from a structural engineer of your caliber.

BRIANNA	Youíre very welcome Hans. I now need to oversee the physical inspection of the tower to ensure the ‘dreamí is fully realized.

GRANGER	Sure. I look forward to continuing our partnership.
 
BEAUMONT	So you confirm that Brianna will continue on the project?

GRANGER	Of course! We already talked about that. Basic due diligence before any acquisition. I want to make sure everything is fine to the last detail.

BEAUMONT
Of course.

GRANGER	All right then, that does it for today. Weíll have a decision for you in the next quarter.

BEAUMONT	Fantastic. Weíre still having dinner tonight?

GRANGER	Of course! We have a table reserved at eight pm in my favorite restaurant.

BEAUMONT	I would appreciate if miss Bronson joins us.

GRANGER	Iím afraid that wonít be possible. She-

BEAUMONT	Hans... In such an important matter we all have to feel confident. As mrs Bronson... Brianna... is now part of this “continuing partnership”, as you said...

GRANGER	Let me talk to her. Iím sorry, Brianna but I think youíll have to stay in Paris one more night.

BRIANNA	But Iím supposed to catch the train back to Antwerp in an hour-

GRANGER	Please Brianna? Beaumont is known for being kind of touchy. Iíd love things to go smooth between us all. Do you understand?

BRIANNA	Why yes... of course.

GRANGER	Thank you.

BRIANNA	‘Call homeí

PHONE 	‘Calling... homeí
 
BRIANNA	Hi honey, somethingís come up. The client asked me to stay later so Iíll have to take the train back to town tomorrow morning... Call me.

BEAUMONT	As we expected, that Bronson woman will be a problem if she gets deeper into this.

STEELE	Yeah, looks like sheís not the kickback type.

BEAUMONT	I know. But I just want this handled with subtly, we are not a bunch of cowboys.

STEELE	Donít worry and stick to the plan I made for you. Sheís a wife and a mother, weíre going to make her uncomfortable and take her out of the game, make it about her family...

BEAUMONT	I need her to be gone before the next quarter.
 
STEELE	Sheíll be. And you get Granger to sign. You can give it a go.

BEAUMONT	Ok. You have 3 hours to get everything ready.

BERT	Yes, sir. Brianna! Well, thatís a surprise... What are you doing here? You donít live in Antwerp anymore?

BRIANNA	Well yes. But... How...

BERT	Brianna... Donít tell me you donít recognize me!

BRIANNA	Iím very sorry, I... donít know.
 
BERT	Bertrand! New Yearís Eve. What... Two- three years ago? Iím so glad.

BRIANNA	Listen, errr, Bert...

BERT	Bertrand.

BRIANNA	Bertrand, Iím really sorry but... I have to go, I have a dinner that I am late for.

BERT	Ah? Ok. I get it.

BRIANNA	Again, Iím sorry.

BERT	Well, letís get in touch in Antwerp, then?

BRIANNA	Sure, yes.
 
BRIANNA	Iím sorry Iím late-

HANS	Oh no, donít be.

BEAUMONT	Being late is a womanís privilege.

HANS	Here, weíve saved you a seat.

BEAUMONT	Hans told me youíre an expert in rock climbing.

BRIANNA	Maybe not an expert, but Iíve always loved it for sure.

GRANGER	And youíve been doing this for how long?

BRIANNA	Since I was a little girl. At the end of my studies, I even planned to work as a mountain rescuer.
 
BEAUMONT	If I may ask, what made you change your mind?

BRIANNA	I met Tom. My husband.

BEAUMONT	So you gave up your passion for him? No regrets?

BRIANNA	Definitely not. I changed the order of my priorities. I wanted to raise a family.

BEAUMONT	How do you handle this, then?

BRIANNA	You seem to have a strange view of a womanís life. I can manage my passion, my family and my job with no problem.

GRANGER	Well, what about we order the wine?
 
BRIANNA	Tom... Could we have two minutes together? Tom, this is our last chance. Are you sure you want to go that way? Canít we just put this horrible prank behind us?

TOM	Prank, Iím sorry... You know I have a serious problem buying into that. The point is I have lost all trust in you and our marriage.

BRIANNA	What more do I have to do to convince you? I swear to God I never had an affair. I quit working on the project in Paris and I am staying here as much as I can to convince you that our marriage is more important than my job..

TOM	You know I really wish I was the kind of guy that could just put things behind him. Forget it ever happened. The problem is I am not.
 
STEELE	I thought we got her off the project... what is she doing here?

BEAUMONT	A beautiful coincidence: her husbandís divorce lawyer is a partner at Lando and Associates down on sixty-eight.

STEELE	Really? So nothing to do with the building?

BEAUMONT	Nothing! Just another failed marriage. The pictures worked beautifully as promised. She could not go back to Paris anymore and had to resign. No need for blood, you see?

STEELE	Well, it cost us a little more than expected to buy the new inspector and the new engineer but it was worth it. We passed inspection, nothing can change that, closing is only a week away.

BEAUMONT	All right. Hell itís hot in here. Any idea what is going on with the air conditioning?

STEELE	That's an interesting question coming from the person who installed a system for half the cost and sixty percent less capacity than recommended.
 
ANTON	Allo! Yes, immediately! Letís go!

PAUL	I promise you a flower. Before the day is-
 
ADRIA	Thank you, goodbye. Nice to see you again Mr Bronson. Please follow me.

JAMES	So she says to me “so how am I going to make the house payments” How about getting a job lady”... Hi Tom. Brianna?

MICHELLE	Sir.

JAMES	How are you, Miss Minor? Iím glad to welcome you all to our new offices. What a beautiful tower, isnít it, Mrs Bronson?

MICHELLE	Perhaps itíd be best if we got started?

TOM	Yes. Letís get this over with.
 
JAMES	Sure. Absolutely. Please take a seat.

BRIANNA	How are the kids today?

TOM	Perfectly fine. They canít wait to officially live at their fatherís.

ANNE	I don't think daddy is going to be happy that we are looking at these pictures.

BEN	Are you going to tell him?

ANNE	No.

BEN	I feel that somethingís wrong.

ANNE	I looked a zillion times already, Iím telling you. It really seems that mom had a boyfriend in Paris.

BEN	Itís weird. Each time they kiss, the shots are closer.

ANNE	Ok... So?

BEN	I donít know... The shots donít seem in a logical order...

ANNE	So you think this is fake?

BEN	Donít know yet.

ANNE	I wish youíre right...

BEN	I got it! Look! You see the passers-by in this shot?

ANNE	Yeah, well... So?...

BEN	They should be somewhere up here. But itís like they suddenly disappeared.

ANNE	Yeah, youíre right. This photo seems to have been taken at a different time.

BEN	Exactly! They donít match. That why every time they kiss, these are mid- shots. To avoid the passers-by!
 
ANNE	And thatís why we never see momís face when sheís kissing the guy.

BEN	Two different persons. Mom and someone else dressed like her. What the hell? Why would anyone do that?

ANNE	We have to tell Dad.

BEN	Just tried. But he doesnít answer his phone. And momís is turned off. Surely because  theyíre at the lawyerís office.

ANNE	I bet the address is in his e- mails...

BEN	Here it is... Lando and Associates. 60th floor of the UBX Tower!

ANNE	Call a cab!

BEN	Theyíll be mad... No, even worse.

ANNE	BEN! BEN Damn. Ok. Still not answering?

BEN	Nope.

PAUL	Vertragen, waar ga je heen?

BEN	Sorry, do you speak English?

PAUL	Ah yes, sorry. Where are your parents?

BEN	Theyíre upstairs, at the lawyers.

PAUL	Which lawyers? Lando and Associates? 60th floor. Hold on... When you see the pretty receptionist -her name is Adria- give her this for me.

ANNE	Okay. I will.

BEN	Smooth.

PAUL	Right this way.

BEN	Bye.

PAUL	Good-bye.

TOM	This is the problem. Selfish, unavailable. She was focused on her career rather than the family. And then an affair-
 
BRIANNA	I DIDNíT HAVE AN AFFAIR!!!

TOM	Its the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room Brianna...

BRIANNA	I made a lot of sacrifices to prove that I loved you but you never believed me, youíre the one thatís throwing our mariage away!

MICHELLE MINOR	My client is right. The incriminated photos are no tangible evidence.

JAMES LEVIN	But you were unable to bring us the proof that those photos are fake. And thatís why we are here today...

ANTON	Nooo!
 
TOM	Whatís that?

BRIANNA	The fire alarm.

JAMES	Is there anything else your client wants to add to her outburst?

MICHELLE	Not for now, thank you.

TOM	About the fire alarm, what do we do?

JAMES	Iíll look into it. Adria?

ADRIA	Yes sir?

JAMES	Be a good girl and find out whatís going on, would you?

ANTON	Thereís been an explosion, the transformer... We need to evacuate the building...

BEAUMONT	Thereís a problem in the 20th flor machine room, something overloaded.

STEELE	Why couldnít it have held for one more week?

BEAUMOMT	Iím sure theyíll have it under control soon.

ANTON	Come on! Follow me! Aim for the base of the flames!

ANTON 	Watch out! Hey, I need some help, here!  Help !!!!

ANNE	We have to get out! What are we going to do? Ben?! What are we going to do?

BEN	Shut up! I donít know!

ANNE	HELP! HELP! WEíRE STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR!!!! HELP! HELP!

BEN	HELP US! HELP US!
 
ANNE	No one can hear us.

ANTON	Hello! Is there someone there?!

BEN	YES! Weíre here! Help us!

ANNE	Weíre stuck in the elevator! Please help!

ANTON 	I HEAR YOU! Hold on! Sorry, have to close the doors... Or the smoke... will kill you... I... come back with some... help...

BEN	No!

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Get these people out of here! Secure a perimeter!
 
NATASHA VILA	Thank you Mark. The UBX tower one of the newest structures in Antwerp and one of the taller buildings in Europe is on fire. It appears that the fire is emanating from the 40th floor...

TOM	Oh my god!

JAMES	We need to get out of here before this becomes another Nine-Eleven.

BRIANNA	Nine eleven was commercial jets full of fuel. This is a very different situation, itís not going to bring down the building.

MICHELLE	Do you see the size of those flames?

BRIANNA	There are fire suppression systems throughout the building, itís safest if we stay here and wait for the fire to be put out.

JAMES	Youíre pretty confident about these ‘fire suppression systems...

TOM	Its her business. I would heed her advice.
 
JAMES	Well, I'm more into “get the hell out of a building when itís on fire”.

MICHELLE	Alright, letís all figure out the best way to get out of here.

JAMES	Iíll take the first one.

BRIANNA	The first what?

JAMES	Elevators, stairs, or stay. Iíll take elevators any time.

MICHELLE	You sure?

BRIANNA	That's a really a bad idea. You donít know in which condition are the elevators.

TOM	I am afraid I have to agree with my wife on this.

JAMES	Nine-Eleven. The ones who got out first are the ones who lived. Whoís with me?

MICHELLE	Youíre not coming?

TOM	No!
 
BRIANNA	If you do anything you should take the stairs. Theyíre actually designed to be a fire refuge.

MICHELLE	Walk down 60 floors, that will take an hour. Iíd rather take my chances on the elevator.

BRIANNA	One last time, this is really a bad idea.

PAUL	Adria! Where are you?

ADRIA	Iím up top Paul! Theyíre all taking the elevator.

PAUL	Whatís that? What did you say?
 
ADRIA	Theyíre taking the elevator Paul! Should I go down with them?

PAUL	The elevator? No! Stay away from those! Take the stairs!

ADRIA	Oh my God! Wait! Stop!

JAMES	Sorry Adria, weíre full- take the next one.

ADRIA	No! Donít!

JAMES	Tough break.
 
BRIANNA	Phone?

TOM	Mine. Itís Ben. Hello? What? Where?

BRIANNA	What is it?

TOM	Hold on- Where? What floor?

BRIANNA	Whatís going on?

TOM	Hold on Ben. Theyíre here.

BRIANNA	Here? What do you mean here???

TOM	Well theyíre here and theyíre stuck in an elevator.

BRIANNA	Oh my God. Which one?

TOM	I donít know somewhere near the fire.

BRIANNA	Above or below?
 
TOM	I... DONíT... KNOW!

BRIANNA	Give me the phone! Ben? BEN? Which floor are you on? Can you see a number on the elevator?

BEN	Weíre just below the twentieth Mom... A man opened the door below us and there was lots of smoke and fire. He started coughing because of the smoke and he left.

BRIANNA	Ben! Listen to me! That smoke is poison! Use your shirts, and put them over mouth and nose! I want you to breath through your shirts do you understand?

FIRE DEPART. MESSAGE	Please hold. Due to the large call volume weíve been forced to put you on hold. If this is not an emergency, please call your local emergency services
 
TOM	God damn it.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	We have a dozen lawyers in an elevator sir!

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	A dozen lawyers in an elevator, sounds like some sort of joke.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	No joke sir! Theyíre coming down from the 68th floor.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	We need to get them out of there!

MICHELLE	They say we should stop the elevator and walk down!
 
JAMES	Yeah, whatever!

MICHELLE	Whatís the maximum capacity on this anyway? Ten? Gotta be fifteen of us in here.

JAMES	Relax, everythingís fine, weíre going down.

MICHELLE	Smells like smoke. Didnít she say the smoke might be lethal?

MICHELLE MINOR	Help!! HELP!! LET ME OUT!!!

JAMES	COVER YOUR MOUTH! EVERYONE!!
 


CAPTAIN FREDERICK	we have a major gas leak in the basement, we need to widen the perimeters of the safety zone. Get the dosimeter. Letís find out whatís in the air.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Lieutenant Jeanne to Base Camp.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Go on, Lieutenant! How we doing with the elevator?
 


FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Iím so sorry captain, we couldnít override it. We had to get up there. But... It was too late.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	What do you mean?

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Theyíre all dead.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Damn. Ok, Iím coming.

BEAUMONT	What the hell are we going to do Eric? Wait until they get control of the fire and then what?

STEELE	Sir, you need to get a grip. Or would you prefer to come down and give the press an interview about all the buildings safety features that didn't work?

BEAUMONT	So whatís the plan?
 
STEELE	Iím calling my chopper. Weíre flying to the airport where weíll have a jet ready to fly us to a country with no extradition laws.

BEAUMONT	Alright.

STEELE	Iím gonna need a pickup. Soon as possible. Crosswind? I donít care about crosswind. I want you to get here NOW!! Hell yes. Ok. All right. Theyíll be here in twenty, letís clean up. We need to destroy any compromising document.

TOM	You two just stay put, relax, Mom and I are going to figure out the best way to get you guys out of there. Itís going to be okay.

BRIANNA	Listen to your Dad. Everythingís fine.
 



BEN	Okay...

TOM	Anne? You hear me?

ANNE	I hear you Daddy... The phone battery is low.

TOM	Really? Where is it at?

BEN	Sixteen percent.

TOM	All right. Weíre going to save the power, so weíre going to hang up the phone for now, and call you when weíve worked things out ok?

ANNE	No!

BEN	Donít hang up Dad!

TOM	You trust me donít you?

BEN	Yes?

TOM	Then trust me when I tell you, everything is fine. Iím going to go now.

BEN	Yes.

ANNE	Okay.
 
BRIANNA	I love you both more than anything in the world.

ANNE	I love you mommy.

BEN	Me too!

ANNE	Itís going to be all right, isnít it?

BEN	Yes.

BRIANNA	I donít know how you can do that.

TOM	What?

BRIANNA	Lie to them like you do.

TOM	Really? You seem pretty good at lying to me.
 
BRIANNA	Enough with that. We need to help our kids. Come on! Help me!

TOM	Oh God.

BRIANNA	Shh! Ben! BEN!

TOM	We take the stairs.

BRIANNA	Like I said earlier, the stairwells could be full of toxic smoke. They could be a deathtrap.

TOM	The only other way down is the elevator shaft: 60 floors straight down.

BRIANNA	Theyíre on the twentieth floor, weíre on the sixtieth. The stairs will take too much time.

TOM	Weíd better get going then. Itís them. Hello?

BEN	Daddy! Thereís a lot of smoke! Itís really hard to breathe!

PAUL	The fire started on the twentieth floor, in the maintenance area.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	It will have spread a good deal by now if the sprinklers arenít working. Have you cut the power yet?
 
PAUL	Not yet.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Weíll send someone to cut it. We donít need any more accidents.

PAUL	What do we do for the elevators?...

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Weíll have to bring them down immediately.

OFFICE WORKER 1	Smoke! You canít go any lower.

ADRIA	Oh, no!

BEN	Daddy... Hurry! Thereís a lot of smoke now.

TOM	Hold your shirts up in front of your faces! Breathe through your shirts!
 
BRIANNA	Ben! Anne! There is a hatch in the elevator. Behind the ceiling lights.

BEN	Ok.

BRIANNA	Do you think you can get to it?

BEN	Itís high.

BRIANNA	Ben listen to me. The smoke is poison. You have to get you and your sister out of the elevator as soon as possible do you hear me?$

BEN	Yes!

BRIANNA	You need to get out. Think.

BEN	WE CANíT REACH IT!!

BRIANNA	Listen to me! Can Anne stand on your shoulder and get to it???

BEN	Yeah, I think so...

BRIANNA	Then she can open the hatch!!
 
BEN	Ok, weíll try.

BRIANNA	You have to do it!

TOM	You hear what your Mom is saying Ben? Do you understand?

BEN	Yes but sheís heavy!

TOM	You can do it Ben. I know you can. You gotta help each other.

BEN	Anne, lets do it!

BEN 	Climb!

ANNE	No. You go first.

BEN	You go!

ANNE	I wonít be able to pull you up. You go. You trained with Mom.

BEN	Okay.

ANNE	Heís doing it. The battery Daddy.

TOM	Hang up! Weíll call you!
 
BRIANNA	Come on! This is the north side. We have to check the south elevators. BEN! BEN!!

BEN 	...Mom!... ...Mom!.... Is everything okay? Come on!

ANNE	Here! Be careful.

BEN	Hurry! Climb up!

ANNE	I canít reach!

BEN	Come on!

ANNE	Itís hot!

BEN	Anne! You have to do it! Please Anne!

 


ANNE	Iím trying, Ben!

BEN	Come on Anne! Do it for Mom and Dad! Think Spiderman! Keep going! Keep going! You did it!

BRIANNA 	Heeeyyyyy....

BEN	Look... I think itís Mom. HEYY!!!

ANNE	HI MOM!

BRIANNA	They got out. Good. Now we just need to go down and get them.
 
TOM	Hold on.

BEN	Hello... I canít- Itís hard to hear you Dad!

ANNE	Tell him the elevatorís on fire!

BEN	The elevatorís on fire Dad! The elevatorís on fire!

BRIANNA	They have to stay away from the smoke! Tell them to find a vent. Stay near a vent!

TOM	Ok. Ben! Look for a vent!

BEN	What?

TOM	A vent Ben. An air duct. Where fresh air is coming in. Do you see anything like that?
 
BEN	I see one!

TOM	You have to avoid the smoke and get to the ventilation vent!

BEN	Dad itís above me, I'm not sure how I can get there.

TOM	Ok, I understand. Ben, its going to alright... Iím going to hang up now, so we can save the battery but you have to think of a way to get to that vent.

BEN	Ok Dad.

TOM	Okay.

BEN	We have to climb to that vent!

ANNE	How?

BEN	The ladder.

ANNE	Okay! You go first!

 


CAPTAIN FREDERICK	We have to emergency ground the elevators. We canít have anyone else getting trapped and suffocating in the smoke.

PAUL	I got it.

ANNE	Climb higher.

BEN	Ok.

ANNE	You can do it Ben!

BEN	1... 2... 3... Aaah! Your turn Anne!

ANNE	Ben!

BEN	Anne!

BRIANNA	Theyíre grounding the elevators!

TOM	So?

BRIANNA	Iím sorry.

TOM	What about?
 
BRIANNA	Thereís no time Tom...

TOM	What are you doing?

BRIANNA	Itís the only way.

TOM	Brianna!

BRIANNA	Come find us! BEN! ANNE!

BEN	Mom! Mom!

BRIANNA	Iím coming Ben! Stay put!

BEN	Mom! ITíS ANNE!

BRIANNA	Just hold on Ben! Iím on my way.

BEN	Mom! Mom! No!

BRIANNA	Hold on Ben!

BEN	Mom! NO! DONíT FALL!

BRIANNA	Be quiet Ben! I need to focus!

 


BEN	Mom! Are you okay?

BRIANNA	Yes... Whereís your sister?

BEN	Sheís gone.

BRIANNA	What do you mean?! Where is she Ben?

BEN	Mom...

BRIANNA	Where is Anne?! Oh my God what happened?! Did she fall? What happened?! Talk to me! Is she all right?

BEN	I... donít... know. When the elevator went down... she was on the roof. It took her down... there. Do you think sheís okay?

BRIANNA	Sheíll be fine, donít worry.
 
ANNE	Hello!? Is anyone here?! Hello? Can someone help me? Eweh. Oh no.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Captain! Our first team will be getting to the point of origin in just a couple of minutes.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	All right. Howís the evacuation?

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	We think we have just about everyone out now.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Better make sure. Jeanne, How are we doing on the ground?

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Everyone is back a hundred meters but we havenít been able to shut off the gas leak in the garage.
 
CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Just a matter of time before something sets it off. Weíd better make sure no oneís been left behind underground.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Got it.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	All right, letís keep it that way.

PAUL	No news from Adria? My girlfriend? She never made it out!

BRIANNA	We canít stay here forever Ben, can you make it over here?

BEN	No way mom!

BRIANNA	Ben. The fire is spreading. The smoke... The smoke is getting too thick. Ben... Look at me Ben. Come on Ben. Look at me.

 


TOM	Oh God... oh God... Ok... Just run through it... just run through. Bad move...

LAURENZ	Oscar Oscar nine nine fiver approaching UBX tower. Fire causing stability issues with the landing platform, advise for immediate departure.

STEELE	Heís here.

BEAUMONT	Almost done. Whatís to keep them from finding the inspectors body in the rubble?

STEELE	We do this right, weíll be long gone. All we need to do is get to the airport, theyíre prepping the jet. Besides if weíre lucky, theyíll miss the connection.

BEAUMONT	Itís just not fair, we were so close.

STEELE	We live to fight another day. Ok. Letís go.

TOM	Oh no. No... no....

LAURENZ	Oscar Oscar nine nine fiver I need clearance for transit to Antwerp International.

STEELE	We need to go!

LAURENZ	I need clearance or we will never be allowed to land. Roger control, following five, niner seven to Antwerp International.
 
STEELE	Whatís the problem lets go!

LAURENZ	We have a lot of heat from the building, it makes the air very choppy.

BEAUMONT	Damn it, land back on the building!

STEELE≤	Shut up! Weíll be fine.

LAURENZ	The heat from the fire is affecting the lift. Mayday! Mayday! We are going down... Repeat, we are going down!! Brace for impact!!

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	TAKE COVER! NOOOO!!!!!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	I need oxygen!

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Where was he?

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	In the stairwell.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Easy there sir, we got you. Weíre just going to catch our breath here for a minute then weíll get you out of here. Whoa whoa calm down now- Calm down!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Hold him down! Just a second...

TOM	Stop! Stop! No! My wife and kids!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Whatís that?

TOM	Theyíre in the elevator shaft.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	In the shaft?

TOM	Yes. Yes we have to find them. Help me!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	No, youíre getting evacuated.

TOM	No! You donít know where they are-
 
FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Which shaft?

TOM	Come on, Iíll show you.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Heís not equipped. You donít have any gear. You need to get out of here.

TOM	Itís my family!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	The best way to help them is to let us do our jobs.

TOM	You canít stop me.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	We donít have time for this.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	The fireís moved into the walls. Itíll be unpredictable. Dangerous. We wonít be able to protect you, do you understand?

TOM	Yes! Come on! Thereís no time! They should be around the 20th floor. In the south shaft.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	All right.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Weíll take the stairs. Go! Whew...

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	That was really brave.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	And a little stupid. 20th floor you said?

TOM	Yeah.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Weíre here. Letís go.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Itís warm.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Thatís the point of origin, should have burnt out by now.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Which shaft did you say it was? South?
 


FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	No! Stay down! Stay down!

BRIANNA	You have to do it Ben. You have to.

BEN	I canít Mom. I canít do it.

BRIANNA	Okay Ben. I believe you. Do you remember our seaside holidays together? You were, what? Seven? Dad had rented this huge villa on the cliff. Everyday we had picinic on the beach. You and Anne loved it. There were those two big rocks popping up from the sand. Do you remember them? Well, they were not so big, actually. Bigger than you were, for sure. But for you, they were like two big mountains. They were three feet away from each other. You used to climb on the first one. I was on the other. And you waited for me to hold my hand out. Then you jumped! Anne was terrified each time you did it. And it made you laugh your head off!

BEN	I called her chicken.

BRIANNA	She was just scared for you.

BEN	Yeah, right.

BRIANNA	Ben... Ben!! You gotta reach the ladder! Try to grab the ladder!!

BEN	Mom!!!!!

BRIANNA	Ben... Iím begging you.

BEN	Dad!! Dad!!!

TOM	Ben! Hold on, both of you! Come on, Ben, come to us. Thatís it, buddy. Youíre almost done. Whereís your sister? Whereís Anne? Where is she? What happened to her?

BRIANNA	He said last he saw her she was holding onto the cable when they grounded the elevators.

NICK	Thatís more than 20 storeys down.

TOM	Well, we have to go down there and get her.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	There is absolutely no going into the basement. We have a major gas leak. The entire place could blow at any moment.

BRIANNA	Lieutenant we have to find her. One way or another.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	We have a gas leak in a building on fire. Do you understand the math madame? We have to get you out of here now! Weíll send a separate party to go look for her as soon as we get the gas leak under control.

BRIANNA	Now you listen to me, Iím not leaving my daughter in the basement! I'm going down there!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	There is no way to get there. The entire basement has been sealed off.

BRIANNA	The elevator shafts.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	What?!

BRIANNA	My daughter is at the bottom of the elevator shaft. Waiting for Me. Iím going to get her and I need a climbing rope, gloves, and some oxygen.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Are you crazy, you can't climb down a fifty story shaft!...

TOM	Sheís been climbing since she was a kid. Sheís free climbed the Eiger twice.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Jeanne.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Yes?

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Give her what she wants.

FIRE LIEUT. JEANNE	Yes sir.

BRIANNA	Donít be scared, Iíll find her okay?

BEN	I love you mom.  And Iím not scared anymore.

BRIANNA	And I love you too very much.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	The radio may not work down there, but the locating beacon will.
 
BRIANNA	Got it.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	We only have fifty meters of rope. Itís about three hundred feet down to the bottom.

BRIANNA	I wasnít planning on tying off to the building.

BEN	All is my fault.

TOM	Of course not.

BEN	Yes! Everything happened because Anne and me came to see you.

TOM	Why did you come?
 
BEN	Because we found the proof that the photos of Mom with the guy are fake. We wanted to tell you.

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Come on, we have to get you out of here.

NATASHA VILA	Someone is still alive from the wreckage of the downed chopper... Iíve just been told that itís Lucas Beaumont himself, the man behind the tower! Mister Beaumont may have survived the helicopter crash. But Iím not sure he is going to survive the fire investigation into this building.
 
FIREMAN 1	Captain! We just found a womanís body encased in concrete.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	Encased in concrete?

FIREMAN 1	Affirmative, Captain. Between ground zero and the parking underground level. Itís the crater created by the A/C crash that trashed the concrete and released the dead body.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	What the hell...

FIREMAN 1	And there was this tag attached to her.

NATASHA VILA	Did you say Eveline Hoff? She was reported missing a year ago.

CAPTAIN FREDERICK	How do you know?

NATASHA VILA	Come on, itís my job! It was on the news. She was a building inspector on this tower and disappeared suddenly.
 
BRIANNA	Anne! ANNE! ANNE! ANNE! PLEASE! ANNE!! ANNE !!!!

TOM	We have to send a team down to find her!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Thereís no time. We need to get out of the blast area son.

TOM	What do you mean thereís no time?

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	The gas will probably ignite any second! There are too many remnant fires and electoral shorts. Come on! We have to get clear.

TOM	My wife and daughter are down there... You have to get them out!!

FIRE LIEUTENANT NICK	Listen to me, there is nothing I can do for your wife and daughter with out risking a lot of other peoples lives. They need to get out of there on there own.

TOM	Let me go!!!

BEN	Dad!!!
 


BRIANNA	What?... What?... Anne? ANNE? Anne! Breathe sweetie! Breathe! Iím here sweetie. Mommyís here. You did so good baby. You did so good hiding here. You did so good. You were so brave here all alone... Now we have to get out, you and me. As fast as we can. Youíre ready?
