(INTRIGO)
(DEAR AGNES)



NARRATOR	The people of the world are more or less the same. Though we may come in different shapes and colors, we all share the same inheritance. And we all have our backstories and our secrets. And so has Agnes, walking her dogs on the beach. Soon her life will change, and the past will become the present, again. Even though evolution might seem to mature us, there are still parts of our brain that belong to our reptile ancestors. Although we've convinced ourselves that hate, revenge, and nemesis belong to the past, our ancient ancestors' blood still runs in our veins, whether we like it or not.

ERICH	Clara and Thomas are coming Thursday. Will you be home then?

AGNES	I'm in Altmaar on Thursday.

ERICH	Oh, yes. Damn. Maybe it's just for the best. Can't you just tell me his name? The man that you love.

AGNES	His name is Erich Neumann-Hansen, and he's sitting right here next to me. Do you want another painkiller?

ERICH	I don't want anything.

AGNES	The doctor said you can take...as many as you want.

ERICH	I just want you to be happy. I want you to feel okay. And I don't want you to argue.

AGNES	I just find it strange, the way they start turning up now. It's all that matters to me, darling.

ERICH	That you don't argue.

AGNES	I don't argue.

ERICH	I know.

AGNES	Do you want me to prepare some food...for Thursday?

ERICH	Thomas can bring some Thai. I love you.

AGNES	I know. Keats, Byron.


PETER	He always money, money, money. He lives, breathes, sleeps money. So I said to him, "Sure. You've got the money, Frank. But you can't buy talent." At least not your own.

WOMAN	Sorry.

PETER	Am I right?

WOMAN	Yes, definitely.

PETER	Oh, we need more wine in here. More wine, Henny. Henny?

SINGER	I think I found... a little bit of heaven.

PETER	Right. Where was I? Uh, love and talent. Come on, you can't do that. I hate it like that. I'm not going  Simple as that. You would've done the same. And then, then they want you to transfer me to the head office in London and then the shit hit the fan. I mean, I just thought, "No, not doing that. I've had enough." Career change for me, within 12 months, I bought this beautiful I just said, "No, that's it. You can take your job and you can stick it up your ass. I'm gonna be one of the best TV producers in Europe."

DORIS	How old are the girls now?

HENNY	Rea is ten and Betty is eight.

DORIS	Oh, big girls now. Haven't seen them in years. How are things for you?

HENNY	For me?

DORIS	Are you working at all?

HENNY	I've a--I've got a few things in the pipeline but nothing set in stone as yet.

DORIS	I'm just the same. I didn't take anything for granted.

HENNY	Shall I come pick you up later after riding, Betty?

BETTY	I can take the bus.

HENNY	Okay. So, I'll see you at dinner, all right?

REA	Come on, Betty. We have to run.

BETTY & REA	Bye, mom.

HENNY	Kiss... goodbye.

BETTY	Bye.

HENNY	Bye.

BETTY	Come on.

PETER	No, no no, no, no. We can't accept that. Nope. Not a chance. Well, then I'll put Vera Kaufmann on it instead. Yeah. Well, you know what that means, don't we? So, do me favor, give it a call, or even...


MAN	All right.

WOMAN	Well, you Agnes. I'm so sorry. God bless you.

CLARA	I'll go with Thomas instead. So, see you there?

AGNES	Yes. Suit yourself.


THOMAS	down there for the house.

CLARA	What are you talking about?

THOMAS	Keep everything and then you could, uh, you could get a separate house there and, uh, then we could build two more house there.

CLARA	That's a horrible idea.

THOMAS	We could use to get  we're very close 

CLARA	No. It feels so strange now that dad's not here. How does it feel for you to be completely alone in this big house?

AGNES	I'm not alone. Byron, Keats, food 

THOMAS	What, what difference does it make if I take it now or later? It's mine anyway.

CLARA	Let's wait until evaluation.

THOMAS	Fine, fine.

PUMPERMANN	 "And thus it follows that the estate, both banking deposits and property with its inventory in Maardam, shall be divided into two equal parts. The first part will go to my children, Clara and Thomas, and the other part to my wife, Agnes. Being of sound mind, memory, and understanding, Erich Neumann-Hansen."

AGNES	But hang on. What happened to a property being left in marital trust?

THOMAS	According to the law, if we were both your children, that would be the case, but it just so happens that we're not. Luckily, for us. Now, I know that these things can take some time, but... both Clara and I would appreciate it if all of this could be over and done with as soon as possible. Clara. We'll stay in touch.

PUMPERMANN	I know you want to stay in this house, Agnes. I know. But surely there's nothing to prevent... you from buying them out? Neither Clara nor Thomas seem to want the house anyway.

AGNES	How can I ever afford to, on my salary?

PETER	I had lunch with Susanne Liebermann today.

HENNY	Oh?

PETER	Yeah. And it got a bit embarrassing when she asked if you got that part.

HENNY	What part?

PETER	That's exactly what I said. Apparently, you told her that you had a gig on the go. Now, this autumn. It wouldn't have hurt to tell me, would it? I felt like a right idiot.

HENNY	Okay.

PETER	Okay?

HENNY	What do you want me to say?

PETER	Well, what gig would it be, then? You know we're opening a new office in Munich. I'm gonna be gone most of the autumn. Henny? Henny?

HENNY	Don't you get it?

PETER	What is there... to get?

HENNY	That things aren't so fucking easy for me. What do you suggest I should have said then? I'm going to bed.

BENJI	Peter's a bastard. You don't love him anymore.

HENNY	It's not that simple.

BENJI	Get a life of your own, a job at the very least. Divorce that waste of space. Come on. It's not like you can't afford it.

HENNY	You've always been so crass. I was at a funeral the other day.

BENJI	Anything for your own amusement.

HENNY	His name was Erich Neumann-Hansen.

BENJI	Erich Neumann-who?

HENNY	He was married to Agnes.

BENJI	Agnes? Your Agnes? Shit. How was she?

HENNY	I don't know.

BENJI	What, you didn't ask her?

HENNY	Not really.

BENJI	What's wrong with you? You know, I never understood what happened between you two.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	Just to the right, just yellowish and brownish one.

AGNES	Yes. I see it, very yellowish, brownish.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	That's a Sphyrapicus varius. It's impossible. It's in... the wrong side of the Atlantic Ocean. Somebody pinch me.

ANSGAR	No fucking... way.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	What the hell is he doing here? Have you seen any others, any females?

ANSGAR	No. Cornell are gonna hear about this. Please don't fly away now.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	It doesn't look bothered. It's fucking brilliant. From now on, you better come along every time, Agnes.

AGNES	Ah.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	Agnes, Agnes. Are you paying attention?

AGNES	Yes. Sphyrapicus... varius.

ANSGAR	Shh. Shut up.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	Also... known as the yellow-bellied... sapsucker.


ANSGAR	Shit.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	Oh.

ANSGAR	Are you nuts? Do you realize what you've just done?

AGNES	No.

HENNY	What's going on?

KLAUS-JOSEPH	Better ask Agnes.

AGNES	Well, it turned out to be a very yellow-bellied, yellow-bellied... sapsucker.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	Did you get him?

ANSGAR	No.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	Shit. Well, maybe it was just a, a larger than normal penduline tit or something.

ANSGAR	No way. It was far too big to be a tit.

AGNES	But Ansgar... darling, you told me tits could never be too... big. For years, they've been... complete strangers, but ever since Erich's diagnosis, it feels like they can't get enough of the place. I think they'll get it and I'll be homeless. Thomas seems to have a heart of stone. No wonder he's an up-and-coming lawyer. And Clara, I don't know. She never puts her foot down, a real... yellowbelly.

HENNY	Proper yellow-bellied sapsucker.

AGNES	She's a sap, all right. How about you? How are things? Are you still in Grothenburg?

HENNY	Yeah. I, I haven't worked in ages. I've been looking after the girls and Peter's always tied up with something.

AGNES	What is he up to these days?

HENNY	He has a big production company. They make film and TV.

AGNES	Sorry. May I have some more wine, please?

DORIS	Yes, yes, of course.

AGNES	Thank you.

HENNY	I think Peter's cheating on me.

AGNES	Oh. I'm sorry. Do you know who?

HENNY	I don't want to know.

DORIS	Here we go. And anything for yourself?

HENNY	No, thank you.

DORIS	Okay, enjoy.

AGNES	Thank you.

HENNY	My car's over there.

AGNES	I'm on my bike. It's been a long time.

HENNY	Can't we see each other again soon?

AGNES	Yes, maybe.

HENNY	Okay. I'll be in touch.

AGNES	Okay.

HENNY	I'm starving. I need meat.

ANSGAR	Student loan gets... paid out on Monday.

HENNY	Agnes, if you hadn't gone and screwed everything, we could all be tucking into a flame-grilled yellow-bellied sapsucker by now.

ANSGAR	You really have the... ability to string out.. a joke.

HENNY	Apart from Ansgar, of course, who might prefer to get his teeth stuck into a big tit.

AGNES	Ouch.

ANSGAR	Did you grab it?

KLAUS-JOSEPH	What?

ANSGAR	The bird watching notes.

KLAUS-JOSEPH	No. I thought you got them.

ANSGAR	Oh, shit!

AGNES	Can you drive us home, please?

ANSGAR	Henny, I thought you're gonna stay at my place today.

HENNY	I'm sorry, darling. All this excitement has really taken it out of me.

AGNES	Me too.

ANSGAR	We'll drop you off by the Botanical Gardens.

AGNES	What? Seriously, Henny, we can't go on like this.

HENNY	I know. How did we end up with the biggest pair of tits in town?

AGNES	Uh-hmm. Speaking of tits, look what I have. Hmm.

HENNY	Oh, you beauty.

AGNES	Hmm.

HENNY	I love you for this. Let's hide it. It's getting dark.

AGNES	Let's hide it.

HENNY	Here in the park. Here. Hide it.

AGNES	Erich, he moved back from Kaalbringen after his divorce. His father had just died. So, he inherited the house. Let's go. Go.

HENNY	It's Peter. Really, I know I should leave him. I mean, he's chosen someone else over me. Probably been several over the years, what do I know? But I can't deal with it. For some reason, I just can't.  You know, I actually began to envy you. What if it was me who'd been left widowed instead? What if I had been you? If Peter... happened to get a terminal illness, leukemia, like Erich.

AGNES	Can you hear what you're saying?

HENNY	I... even think it would be easier for the kids. I can't quite let go of that feeling. The envy and how much easier everything would be.

AGNES	Christ, Henny. Is this some sort of fantasy or is it just one of your sick jokes?

HENNY	Have you seen the film "Strangers on a Train" Hitchcock. Two people meet on a train and they make a deal that each one will commit a murder on behalf of the other. Swap murders, both with watertight alibis.

AGNES	Why are you telling me this?

HENNY	Because I realize I'm the first person they'd suspect.

AGNES	Suspect? Oh. So now you want me... to kill your husband.

HENNY	I've been thinking since we last saw each other. You need cash, right? Well, money isn't a problem. After Mum's will, l...

AGNES	Tell me you're fucking joking.

HENNY	If you do this for me I'll make sure you can keep the house. No one would suspect you.

AGNES	You're sick.

HENNY	Please, Agnes!

AGNES	Get help! Henny! My time has finally come. Say hello to the new Cordelia!

HENNY	Cordelia? Is Groschmann doing King Lear?

AGNES	Yeah. He's here now!

HENNY	Here?

AGNES	Yes.

HENNY	Where?

AGNES	Oh, fuck off! He arrived yesterday. And next week they're holding auditions at the Kellerteater! So, you have to help me, Henny. I really wanted to get this part! So, you have to do lines with me.

HENNY	I'll do anything for you. You know that.

AGNES	I mean he's Mr. "Everything I Touch... Turns into Gold" Groschmann. So, this is the chance of a lifetime. You've met him, haven't you? What's he like?

HENNY	Wow. We had... a wonderful night. It's like one of these nights where two souls merge into one.

AGNES	Oh, stop it! Stop!

HENNY	No, we only had half an hour together during that interview but he's special, you know.

AGNES	Uh-hmm.

HENNY	He sort of stays with you.

AGNES	Hmm. Hmm. Ready? "If he be taken, I shall nevermore be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose. How in my strength you please. For you, Edmond." "In the good man's distress. Seek, Seek for him, lest..."

HENNY	"Lest his..."

AGNES	"Lest his..."

HENNY	"Ungoverned raged dissolve the life."

AGNES	"Ungoverned...

AGNES	rage dissolve the life."

HENNY	"News, madam. The British powers are marching hitherward." When I saw you in Cafe Intrigo, it was as if time had stood still, and I realized how much I've missed you. Your laughter. Your way of telling a story. You're one in a million, Agnes. I've understood that you're not interested in my proposal and I respect that. But I hope you might still want to see me, and that, just... maybe, you've missed me, too. I'll never forget that year we spent together in Frau Bloeme's house. Me struggling with my boring Sociology and you with your Literature, longing for your family back in Italy. And that was tough for both of us. It was the happiest time of my life.

AGNES	Shh.

HENNY	Dear Agnes, couldn't we just start over?

AGNES	"With hardock, hemlock... nettles, cuckoo flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds... that grow in our sustaining corn. A century send forth. Search every acre in the high-grown field, and bring him to our eye. What can a man's wisdom..."

HENNY	Sorry, sorry, I forgot. Um, this is when the officer exits!

AGNES	"What can man's wisdom, in his bereaved..."

HENNY	Hold on a minute. Um, now he's... gone. Um, would she carry on in... exactly the same way?

AGNES	What do you mean?

HENNY	I think there can be some kind of break here.

AGNES	Well, I'm doing the audition, not you, and I want Cordelia to be strong.

HENNY	Surely she can be strong without talking in such... a loud voice.

AGNES	Yes, but it's a classical theatrical text, so it's crying out to be interpreted. And we're not doing documentary for the History Channel.

HENNY	All right. I just meant you could... find a slightly different…

AGNES	Surely that's... why... Groschmann is coming here? To see how Cordelia can be interpreted, right?

HENNY	Yeah. But...

AGNES	And this is my interpretation. I mean, I... hope I'm better than Louise.

HENNY	God, yes.

AGNES	And that other girl.

HENNY	Are they auditioning as well?

AGNES	Yeah. They are.

HENNY	Hmm.

AGNES	But it could be interesting, I guess, for Groschmann. I mean, Louise has given talentlessness a brand new face, no? 

HENNY	Put it on the map.

AGNES	Raised the bar.

HENNY	That low.

AGNES	That low. You have to come along tomorrow for moral support.

HENNY	Of course I will.

AGNES	Thank you.

HENNY	Think he'll remember me?

AGNES	Who? Groschmann. You know, I heard he came here only to be close to you. He couldn't get Henny Delgado out of his head. So, the play at the Kellerteater is all because of you. I believe it. Hello?

JOHANN	Johann Clausen. The estate agency. It's nice to meet you. What a fantastic place you have here. It's totally unique. I can just imagine the bidding this place would attract.

CLARA	Hello, Agnes.

JOHANN	I'm just going to look outside.

CLARA	Thomas. Agnes is here now.

THOMAS	You know, I almost worked that... out entirely by myself. Agnes? I'm just wondering what kind of timeframe we're working with. When do you want this in the market? The most important thing is that we get the highest price for

JOHANN	And when are you guys ready to--ready to move?

THOMAS	Now.

JOHANN	Now?

PUMPERMANN	And so apart from deductions for loans and other costs, you'll have to pay Clara and Thomas...

THOMAS	500,000 Euro if you want to buy them out. Give or take 20,000, depending on the new valuation.

AGNES	I cannot manage that. I spoke to the bank yesterday.

PUMPERMANN	I'm sorry, Agnes. This is just how things stand. You, you have to understand the children as well. They don't want to wait for their money.

AGNES	Yes. So I understand. Please wait a few days before telling them.

PUMPERMANN	Okay.

AGNES	I will call you.

PUMPERMANN	When you're ready.

HENNY	Peter?

PETER	Hmm?

HENNY	I'd like to start over. Move to a bigger town, where I can find a job. Get to know some new people. Hey, maybe you could run the new office. I always wanted to live in Munich.

PETER	I'll talk to Gosser. He owes me a favor anyway. Maybe he can get you into something here. Karl-Heinz Theater.

AGNES	Why don't you just hire a professional if you have... so much money? Why come to me?

HENNY	Actually it's completely on impulse. I was thinking about that film and... how we could actually help each other.

AGNES	How much are you prepared to pay?

HENNY	How much do you want?

AGNES	Three hundred thousand. Minimum.

HENNY	I'll give you 400. Minimum.

AGNES	This is really insane, Henny. Fine. How do you imagine this can be done?

HENNY	Let's go outside.

AGNES	He looks just the same... despite everything.

HENNY	There are more pictures inside. You have to know what he looks like nowadays. I have an identical one. I put prepaid cards on both and saved our numbers. You must need it for anything else.

AGNES	Okay.

HENNY	An advance. A hundred and fifty grand. I'll be in touch about dates and all that, okay?

WOMAN	Yes. Hmm.

AGNES	After returning to England in 1811, he got down to work on what would eventually become "Childe Harold." What would you... say sets this work apart?

STUDENT #1	I think... it was written in Spenserian... meter.

AGNES	And what is that?

STUDENT #1	Old metrical form.

AGNES	How old?

STUDENT #1	1600s?

AGNES	1500s. Iambic pentameter followed by a single Alexandrine.

STUDENT #1	Are you all right?

AGNES	You'll have to excuse me.

HENNY	Yes.

AGNES	I can't do it. This is madness. I couldn't live with myself.

HENNY	If that's how you feel.

AGNES	Yes, that's how I feel.

HENNY	Right. It's a stupid idea.

AGNES	Yes, it was.

HENNY	So forget about it then.

AGNES	Good. We'll forget it ever came up, Henny.

HENNY	Okay.

AGNES	Just give me your bank account and I'll, I'll return your money.

HENNY	No, no. That won't work. It would look very strange. I had to mess about quite a bit to take out that much cash.

AGNES	So what do we do?

HENNY	Next Thursday at 11:00, the Motorway Service Cafe. Can you make it?

AGNES	I'll manage.

PETER	Oh, by the way, I had a chat with Gosser. He's practically given me his word that he'd get you a part. Some Ibsen play... or something. I thought you'd be happy.

HENNY	What? Because you persuaded a mate of yours to get me a minor part in some play... you don't even know the title of?

PETER	Anyone else would leap at the opportunity.

HENNY	Not me.

PETER	So call him and tell him it's off then, yeah?

HENNY	Yeah. I don't need your help.

PETER	Suit yourself.

THOMAS	Oh, you really do have green fingers... or whatever it's called.

AGNES	Thank you.

THOMAS	So, I have the valuation. A little bit more than we expected. It's quite a bit more actually.

AGNES	I want you to leave. This is still my house and my garden.

THOMAS	Agnes, half of this is still yours. The other half belongs to me and to Clara. Very soon now, the whole house is going to be sold.

AGNES	I said go... away.

THOMAS	Don't you think I don't know? Don't you think I don't know how you used my dad, that you were seeing others from the... very second you knew he was terminally ill? I don't understand why he didn't kick you out.

AGNES	And who would've looked after him in his final days? You and Clara? You know nothing about what Erich and I had together.

THOMAS	I know that you never loved my dad. I'm picking up my photo albums... from my childhood. They're hardly yours, are they? No.

AGNES	I want to keep the house.

HENNY	In that case, we have to continue with our plan. No more messing about.

AGNES	But how do we do it? What's your thinking? It feels so unreal, somehow.

HENNY	Do you remember the bird lake, Ansgar and...

AGNES	Karl-Josef.

HENNY	See you there in forty-five... minutes. Turnoff towards the little bridge. I inherited them from dad. I think they're from the war. Anyway, impossible to trace.

AGNES	Uh-hmm. So you want me to shoot him?

HENNY	It's completely up to you. Rather do it another way, that’s fine by me.

AGNES	No, no. It's fine. I've just never handled a gun.

HENNY	Nor have I, well, hardly. It can't be that difficult. You'll have to practice in a forest or something.

AGNES	Yeah.

HENNY	Peter is always going off on conference trips. So, I'll check his calendar. It has to be synchronized with what I'm doing.

AGNES	Uh-hmm.

HENNY	I need a watertight alibi. I can't just be home with the children. That wouldn’t be enough.

AGNES	Look, Henny, why don’t you just leave him? It doesn’t make sense. It doesn't.

HENNY	Because I know deep down that's exactly what he wants me to do. And I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction. And you? How did it go for you?

AGNES	Yeah. He didn't get this at all. He thought he was going great.

HENNY	Same thing with... Ansgar. Clueless, basically. Two tequilas. Salt... and lemon.

DORRIS	Good day for tequilas.

AGNES	Yes. Like that, it is.

HENNY	We have to celebrate, don't we? Finally, it's just the two of us.

AGNES	Uh-hmm. Pity we're not gay.

HENNY	Uh-hmm.

AGNES	Imagine how much easier life would be.

HENNY	I love you. You know that.

AGNES	Yeah, of course. And I love you.

HENNY	Thank you. Come on then. We should go away together once all this is over.

AGNES	Italy, maybe.

HENNY	Now we won't see each other for a bit. I'll wait till you've gone.

AGNES	"Tis known before. Our preparation stands. In expectation of them. O dear father. It is thy business that I go about. Therefore great France. My mourning and important tears hath pitied. No blown ambition... doth our arms incite. But love, dear love and our ag’d father’s right. Soon may I hear and see him."

PETER	Bravo. It's, uh, umn it's Agnes, isn't it?

AGNES	Yes.

PETER	And you did Masha in "The Three Sisters"?

AGNES	Yes, last spring.

PETER	Did you like her?

AGNES	I liked her very much. Both her and the role.

PETER	Chekov, eh, the man who wouldn’t listen to his doctors. It's a bit too mainstream for me, but great fun, I’m sure. Thank you. And thank you all, ladies, for wonderful performances. It's just too bad there can be only one Cordelia. I'll let you know either way tomorrow morning. Noon at the latest. That's a wrap. Oh, yes, and before you leave, anyone interested in reading for Goneril or Regan, be here tomorrow evening, filling that, thanks again.

WOMAN	Okay. Uh-hmm.

PETER	Terrific. Stunning. Terrific.

LOUISE	So... you've met him before, right?

HENNY	Interviewed him for the student magazine last year.

LOUISE	Yeah. He's just amazing. Not that ugly either.

WOMAN	Fine. Maybe you should Yeah, that's true. Do you guys wanna tag along for beer?

HENNY	Sure.

WOMAN	I don't know about you, I think I'll need... three. Let's go. Come on. Oh, come on. Yeah. Of course. Yes.

AGNES	I don't think I did very well, you know.

HENNY	Oh, no, you were great. Well, hardly made much of an impression there.

AGNES	He didn't recognize you?

HENNY	Not in the least. Even though I gave him my most winning smile.

AGNES	Christ. What a drag.

HENNY	Still, you did Cordelia the way you see her.

AGNES	What do you mean the way I see her? How else should I have done it?

HENNY	No, it just meant you can afford to be proud of yourself.

LOUISE	Hey, let's go to Gunthers.

WOMAN	That's a good idea. Do you wanna come? Yeah, come on. Let's go.

HENNY	Come on, let's have a beer.

AGNES	I don't know. I think I'll head off home.

HENNY	Yeah, right. Stop messing about. You sure?

AGNES	Yeah, I'm sure.

HENNY	I'm gonna go. Okay?

AGNES	Okay.

WOMAN	Oh, come on let's go. Let’s go.

HENNY	Let's go.

WOMAN	Hey, ladies. Yes.

AGNES	Hello.

PETER	Hi.

AGNES	Have you decided?

PETER	Hmm, uh-uh. You have a good look. For Cordelia.

AGNES	Thank you.

PETER	Would you like a glass of wine? Red or white?

AGNES	Red.

PETER	Excuse me.

WAITER	Yes, please.

PETER	Can we have two glasses of Red, please?

WAITER	Yes.

WOMAN	Uh, it's closed, guys. So where do we go now?

PETER	So... do you intend on pursuing it?

AGNES	The theater?

PETER	Yeah.

AGNES	Maybe. I guess stranger things have happened.

PETER	Then I'll speak to some people, give you some names. Good names. Good schools. If you're interested, I mean.

AGNES	Yes, I really am. Thank you.

PETER 	Would you like to do all sorts of acting, television, film, theater?

AGNES	I like theater.

PETER	You prefer theater?

WOMAN	Wow. That's really This is... a really nice place. Well done. somewhere.

HENNY	Think I just changed my mind.

AGNES	Can I have a drag?

PETER	Sure. You can't stay, you know. I've got a big day tomorrow. I need to sleep. And as long you're in touching distance, that's gonna make it very difficult.

AGNES	Absolutely.

PETER	Do you know I've been approached many times  at the Kellerteater? It's never quite worked out. I'm glad it has this time, though. This is the first time Shakespeare's ever been down there, you know.

AGNES	So you'll be in touch tomorrow?

PETER	Before 12:00. Promise. Hi, this is Peter Groshman. I can't come to the phone right now so please leave a message.

FRAU BLOEME	On the balcony? Why? Oh, hold on a second. Yes, dear?

AGNES	Have you seen Henny today?

FRAU BLOEME	Uh... uh, she left in a hurry a... couple of hours ago. And what happened then? What was he doing there then?

AGNES	It's half past 1:00. Why haven't you called?

PETER	Ah, sorry, I had to make some chops and changes this morning.

AGNES	Really? Have you decided?

PETER	Yes, I have, actually. It's Henny Delgado here. But we... really need a Goneril, so maybe you can play that part. You're gonna need to-- Agnes? Okay. We'll be rehearsing daytimes for the first three weeks and then a week before, get in the theater…

HENNY	Agnes?

FRAU BLOEME	Yes, she left. I’m as surprised... as you are, dear. She packed everything in an hour. I asked her if something had happened, but she just thanked me for everything and then she was on her way.

AGNES	Well, I think it's almost too good to be true, but I've done my sums and it's going to be fine.

PUMPERMANN	Excellent. Who would ever have thought a banker was capable of changing... his mind? One would think it was against their nature. As I said earlier, Clara and Thomas want this whole thing to be over and done with as soon as possible. The transaction has to be finalized... at the end of the month.

AGNES	At the end of the month. Good. I'll let the bank know.

PUMPERMANN	And I will speak to the children.

STUDENT	"In her first passion, a... woman loves her lover, and all the others, all she loves is love."

AGNES	Thank you.

STUDENT	A mistress never is nor can be a friend. While you agree, you are lovers. And when it is over, anything but friends.

SALES ASSISTANT	Madam.

AGNES	I would like to buy a wig.

SALES ASSISTANT	Okay.

AGNES	Shh.

PETER	There will be, like, eight of us, and remember Wasserman's a vegetarian so you might have to make a... salad or something.

HENNY	Yes, I know. I can make a gratin.

PETER	And then there's a conference in Linden, 25th, 26th, 27th. Might have to go in the 24th, but I won't know until a week before.

HENNY	And where... will you be staying?

PETER	Silverling House, I... presume. That's where she usually books me into. Why do you... ask?

HENNY	I just want to know where you are. That's the same weekend I'll be at that workshop in Saarendorf.

PETER	What workshop?

HENNY	Fine, I'll talk to Benji. The girls could stay with him while I'm away. There's Vienna.

PETER	I know. Exactly. I'll just be getting home and then I'll have to leave again. I tried to cancel it this year, but they didn't want to listen. They were planning to so some sort of

PUMPERMANN	I think I speak for everyone in this room... when I say that it's excellent news that Agnes has managed to persuade her bank. We all know how much... Agnes loves this marvelous house, and how difficult it would be for her to be parted from it. It's also very pleasing that Clara and Thomas... can now take possession of their legacy. The final payment to the respective accounts... will be transferred by the end of next month.

THOMAS	Thank you, Martin.

PUMPERMANN	Right. Well I... think that wrap things up for today.

REA	Wanna play dad?

PETER	Hey. Sorry.

REA	Come on, dad.

PETER	Another time. Slam dunk.

BENJI	When he comes, I leave. Take it easy, sis.

PETER	All right. So I walk in, and you're on your way out.

BENJI	I have a home to take care of. I'll see on the weekend... of 25th, 26th.

HENNY	Absolutely.

PETER	Maybe you should have married your brother instead. Wolfgang. It's been a while. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. I saw your  you were 

HENNY	Have you got a pen and paper?

AGNES	Yes.

HENNY	Silverling House Hotel in Linden.

AGNES	Hmm, I'll find it.

HENNY	Near the conference center. It's walking distance, so probably no taxi.

AGNES	Uh-huh. Okay.

HENNY	There'll be opportunities. They usually keep going till fairly later in the day, so it'll be dark.

AGNES	And where will you be?

HENNY	I'll be at the workshop in Saarendorf. I borrowed a flat on Parkstraat, a little back street behind the railway station. They're called Wittgenstein.

AGNES	Like the philosopher.

HENNY	Exactly. I'm immersing myself in the noble art of acting. What are your dogs called?

AGNES	What?

HENNY	What are your dogs called?

AGNES	Well, I call them Ms. Keats and Mrs. Byron.

HENNY	When everything is over, send me a text,"Keats and Byron".

AGNES	I'll send you a text, "Keats and Byron".

HENNY	Bye.

AGNES	Bye. Keats? Byron? Here.

NEIGHBOR	Thank you.

AGNES	Thank you. I'll be back tomorrow.

NEIGHBOR	No problem, mate.

CLARA	Hello, Agnes.

AGNES	Hello.

CLARA	I just want you to-- well, I wanted to apologize about Thomas. I know he can be a bit of an asshole. But I'm not Thomas, and I wish we'd be friends, you and I.

AGNES	Do you?

CLARA	I know how much you meant to Dad. How much he loved you. I know that. And in a way, I'm glad you're staying at grandfather's house. It's sort... of continuity. It's sort of still there. And one can come here, part of... one's growing up. And I know that's what... dad would have wanted, for you stay on here and we be friends. But... it hasn't been easy for me either.

AGNES	Yes. I can understand that, Clara. And it's fine.

CLARA	Are you going somewhere?

AGNES	No. Not really. I appreciate you coming. I want you to know that. And I'm sure Erich would have too. Sorry. I'm a bit in a hurry.

CLARA	No, of course. See you then. Thanks.

AGNES	Shit.

BENJI	Come on, girls.

REA	Hi there.

BENJI	So I'll see you after the weekend then.

BETTY	Oh, what's that?

REA	It's a slide.

BENJI	How are things with you?

BETTY	That's... so cool.

REA	Pass.

HENNY	Fine. I'm just a bit nervous about all of this, you know. Out of practice, to say the least.

BETTY	But you're stepping all over it.

BENJI	It should be fine.

REA	I dropped it. Pick it up.

BETTY	Hey, budge over.

BENJI	Come on, gang. Let's get out... of here.

REA	Bye.

BETTY	Bye. Bye, mom.

PETER	Hello? Yeah, it's me. yeah, I'll be there Oh, there you are. So what about the house? Do you think you'd be able to keep it?

AGNES	Endless conversations with the bank.

PETER	You know, I'd like to help, but it's just impossible. I can't.

AGNES	I know. But it will work out fine.

PETER	You know, Henny's at some sort of workshop in Kaalbringen--or is it Saarendorf? I can't remember. Anyway, she'll be gone all weekend. Maybe we can meet somewhere tomorrow?

AGNES	I have to get back to the dogs. We can maybe be in touch tomorrow.

PETER	Absolutely.

HENNY	Inside. If you touch the gun, I'll shoot. I said inside. Drop the bag. We're leaving here soon. You can take a seat for now.

AGNES	How long have you been planning this?

HENNY	Ever since I realized it was you. Peter doesn't love anyone. He can't love anyone. Not even his own children. But that doesn't mean I think it's okay... that you're fucking him, like some sort... of revenge for something that happened years ago.

AGNES	But why this playing games?

HENNY	I think I have a bit too much time on my hands.

AGNES	Huh?

HENNY	And also... I was curious how far you're prepared to go.

AGNES	But what if I had done it? What if I had shot him?

HENNY	I took a chance. And I was right, wasn't I? Because of what happened in the stupid theater. You just can't move on, can you? Okay. You hated me then. I can understand that. But that was over 10 fucking years ago, and you still want to kill me.

AGNES	And you, me, apparently.

HENNY	It took a bit of money but it was worth it.

AGNES	You're sick.

HENNY	When things calm down out there, we'll go for a drive. So when... the funeral and all of that crap was out of the way, Peter would just... move into your perfect little home, with a room each for the girls, of course? You know, why not convert the loft? Did you really think he'd want that? That you mean so... much to him?

AGNES	The truth is that he doesn't mean anything to me. It's not my fault that he doesn't love you. You're smart, you're beautiful, and I even think you're funny. So I never understood why Peter doesn't love you? And... he doesn't offer me any clues. I mean, I've asked him, all right. But you know how he is. He just zones out. I actually feel sorry for him.

HENNY	We have two children... together. What... fucking right do you have to destroy that?

AGNES	He's the one who came crawling to me for consolation, and you're... the one who wants me to kill him. You should be grateful, Henny. If I hadn't been there, he would have left you long ago.

PETER	Hello? Yeah. What now? What, what time is it? Why? What's happened? No, no, no. That's okay. It's okay. It's--what? The boat? What, what boat? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember, yeah. Half an hour? Yeah. Yeah, I can be there. But, but what's going on? What the hell's happened?

AGNES	Benji?

BENJI	It's been a while. Can I come in?

AGNES	Please.

BENJI	It's been difficult on the girls, but possibly hardest for Henny.

AGNES	Yes, I can understand.

BENJI	But you know what she's like, sort of, proud, strong. The police even suspected her at one point. That she was involved somehow or even done it herself. And then on top of that, all the hearsay and gossip. So many of her friends have turned their backs on her, if you want to call them friends. She must have felt very alone in all this.

AGNES	I can imagine, yes.

BENJI	I'd like to ask a favor of you. I know it was a long time ago, but for Henny's sake...

HENNY	It's over.

AGNES	Glass of wine?

HENNY	Champagne?

AGNES	Or maybe...

DORIS	Two tequilas for the two ladies outside.
