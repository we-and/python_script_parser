TEACHER	Today we will be covering the last

TEACHER	and most interesting class of rock.

TEACHER	Metamorphic rock 

TEACHER	is a very special sort of rock.

TEACHER	It’s formed under the same condition as igneous rock

TEACHER	but 

TEACHER	with some very significant differences.

TEACHER	Guber, see me after class.

TEACHER	Silence, please.

TEACHER	You will all be tested on this

TEACHER	as soon as you return from spring break.

TEACHER	Gloria?

GLORIA	Will we have to give examples of each, sir?

TEACHER	Yes, as Gloria has quite rightfully pointed out

TEACHER	you'll be asked to illustrate the differences 

TEACHER	between igneous and metamorphic rock

TEACHER	and to provide specific examples of each.

TEACHER	Gloria?

GLORIA	How many examples of each, sir?

GLORIA	Will ten be sufficient? 

TEACHER	Three will be fine, Gloria. 

BOY 	Will ten thousand examples of how amazing I am be sufficient?

BOY	Man, she’s so annoying. I hate it when she does that.

LUCAS	She’s okay.

BOY	Come on, are you kidding?

BOY	Someone needs to put her in her place.

BOY	You know something about this stuff. Your Dad’s a geo-guy or something, right?

LUCAS	Geologist.

BOY	Right, that’s what I said.

LUCAS	I know a bit, but I'm not going to have a public nerd-out for your benefit.

LUCAS	Besides, Guru’s just waiting for an excuse to pound me.

TEACHER	Mr. Winton, I'm not interrupt your social time, am I?

TEACHER 	Know all this, do you?

LUCAS	No, sir. 

TEACHER 	Boring you, am I?

LUCAS	No, sir.

TEACHER 	I see.

TEACHER 	Perhaps you would like to come up to the front of the class 

TEACHER 	and enlighten us all with your understandings of geological metamorphosis. 

TEACHER 	Well class

TEACHER	Mr. Winton has volunteered to take over the lesson.

TEACHER 	Well, Mr. Winton?

TEACHER 	Got nothing to say?

TEACHER 	I assumed you must be an expert.

TEACHER  	Why else would you be so rudely interrupting my class?

TEACHER  	So it would appear 

TEACHER 	that you're nothing more than a rude little time waster. 

TEACHER 	Do you know what happens to time wasters, Mr. Winton?

TEACHER	Hand down, Gloria.

TEACHER 	Well, Mr. Winton? 

LUCAS 	Screw it. 

LUCAS	Geological metamorphosis - 

TEACHER 	Oh, this will be good! 

TEACHER 	Don’t let me interrupt you.Ddo go on.

LUCAS	Geological metamorphosis occurs when a protelith is subjected to temperatures

LUCAS 	greater than  degrees Celsius and pressures of , bars.

LUCAS	This causes physical and-or chemical metamorphosis in the original protolithic structure.

LUCAS	Under these conditions, foliation will  occur as the rock shortens along one axes during recrystallisation.

LUCAS	Platy crystals would then become rotated perpendicular

LUCAS	to the orientation of the shortening called the mineral banding in the rock.

LUCAS	Another important mechanism in metamorphosis is metasomatism

LUCAS	is metasomatism, where the exchange of atoms between minerals results in the formation of new minerals.

TEACHER	Silence!

TEACHER	Silence or you will all receive a detention. 

TEACHER 	And as for you

TEACHER 	I will be speaking to your parents. 

TEACHER 	Take your seat.

MUM	Look, I'll talk to you later. 

MUM 	Hi, sweetie. How was your day?

LUCAS	That was Dad, wasn’t it?

LUCAS	I'm still going, right?

MUM 	Relax. Yes, you're still going. 

LUCAS  	Wow.


LUCAS	I haven’t been to this place in years.

MUM 	Yes, well little did I know that your father made his mother a promise never to sell it.

LUCAS 	Then why is there a for sale sign out front?

MUM  	I haven’t got time to take care of this old place

MUM 	and your Dad obviously isn’t going to do it from overseas. 

MUM 	I have to check on some things. 

MUM 	We’ll have plenty of time to get you to your flight

MUM 	which, for the record, I am still not happy about.

LUCAS	Stop worrying, Mum. I'll be fine.

LUCAS	I don't remember it being this creepy.

LUCAS	It’s like something out of ghost hunters. 

LUCAS	Wait, shh! Did you hear that?

MUM 	Hear what?

LUCAS	The screams of a thousand tormented souls. 

LUCAS	- There’s definitely a presence here. Lucas!

MUM 	You watch far too much television.

LUCAS	I remember Grandma used to tell us some pretty crazy stories.

MUM 	Unfortunately she was not well. 

MUM 	It’s fine to have your head in the clouds, so long as you know where your feet are.

MUM	Yeah, hello? Yeah.

MUM	No, I'm sure. I just want it sold.

MUM	Yes, that’s fine. 

MUM	It will all be out. 

MUM	Goodbye. 

MUM	Lucas!

LUCAS	I'm in here.

MUM 	Look at all this junk.

LUCAS	There’s actually a lot of cool stuff in here.

MUM 	Well unfortunately a bunch of old books isn’t going to help sell this place. 

MUM 	I just hope it will all be out in time for the auction.

LUCAS	You're not going to throw all this stuff out, are you?

MUM 	Lucas, it’s just a bunch of old dusty junk.

LUCAS	Just because it’s old doesn’t mean you have to throw it out.

LUCAS	Besides, Grandma’s whole life is in here. 

MUM 	There are times in life, Lucas

MUM 	where you just have to clean out the past and move on.

LUCAS	Hey, can I keep this? 

MUM 	No. Come on, put it back.

MUM 	Come on, you don’t need a bunch of old stuff cluttering up your room. 

MUM 	Come on, we’ve gotta go. 

MUM  	We’ve got to get you to the airport.

MUM 	Lucas, come on. We gotta go!

LUCAS	Coming. 

ANNOUNCER	This is the final boarding call for QF to Los Angeles.
 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Please turn off all electronic devices. 

FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Once airborne, the Captain will let you know when you can use approved electronic devices.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT 	Right down here. Just by the window.

LUCAS	Hello! 

LUCAS	Is anyone there? 

LUCAS	Hello! 

LUCAS	Does anyone know where I am?

LUCAS	Please, I need help! 

LUCAS	Where’s that coming from? 

LUCAS 	My crystal. 

LUCAS 	What is that doing here? 

LUCAS	Hello! 

LUCAS	Hello! 

LUCAS	Hello? 

LUCAS	Is anyone there?

LUCAS	Hello?

LUCAS	Is anyone there? 

LUCAS	Hello! 

LUCAS 	Okay. Not good.

LUCAS	Help!

KATE 	Quickly, remove your shirt.

LUCAS	What? 

KATE 	They’re after your shirt. Remove it!

KATE	That’s it. Come on.

KATE 	Run! 

LUCAS 	Hey, where are we going? 

KATE  	You'll see.

LUCAS	Whoa, impressive pad you’ve got here. 

LUCAS	Can I use your phone? 

LUCAS	I've been in an accident. 

KATE 	First things first. 

KATE 	I'm Kate. And you are?

LUCAS	Lucas. Lucas Winton.

KATE 	Pleased to meet you, Lucas. 

LUCAS	So can I use your phone – 

KATE 	I wasn't expecting company. 

KATE 	The place is a little untidy. 

LUCAS	That’s okay. 

LUCAS	Look, I don't mean to bother you - 

KATE 	You'll have to take me as you find me, I'm afraid. 

KATE 	Life is very busy at the moment.

LUCAS	No, that’s fine.

KATE 	It’s spring, you see. Mating season. 

KATE 	Which is of course why the raptors were after your shirt.

LUCAS	What? 

KATE 	The animals are very active this time of the year.

LUCAS	Sorry, look I don't mean to be rude, but I'm kind of lost.

KATE 	Oh, how rude of me.

KATE 	You must be thirsty after your ordeal. 

LUCAS	No, look I'm fine – 

LUCAS 	What? 

LUCAS 	This girl is weird.

KATE 	Here, drink up.

LUCAS	Kate, please! 

KATE 	Yes. Yes, of course.
   	   	
KATE 	You have many questions. 

KATE 	Come, I'll explain everything. 

LUCAS	I really need to use your phone.

KATE 	Phone.

KATE 	Oh, you mean telephone?

KATE 	Sorry, I don't have one. Besides, who would I call? 

LUCAS	What about a mobile?


LUCAS	You know, a cell phone. 

KATE 	Well obviously I can’t sell you a phone if I don’t have one. 

LUCAS	Right, okay. Where are we, exactly?

KATE 	Well, I have a sneaking suspicion that we aren’t really any place

KATE 	or any time. 

KATE 	I have a theory that we’re in a place between places. 

KATE 	But that’s not really my field, I'm afraid.

LUCAS	I'm sorry.

LUCAS	You're not really making any sense.

KATE 	I can’t really make sense of it myself. 

KATE 	All I know is that it has provided me the most amazing opportunity to further my studies. 

LUCAS	Studies? Of what?

KATE 	The dinosaurs of course.

KATE  	Palaeontology is my passion. 

KATE 	Although, I'm not quite sure you can still call it palaeontology

KATE 	particularly considering that the animals are still very much alive.

LUCAS	Dinosaurs? 

KATE  	Those animals that attacked you back in the forest were hardly your garden variety bird, were they? 

LUCAS	So you're telling me those things were dinosaurs?

KATE 	Dromaeosaurs, to be precise. 

KATE 	Small, carnivorous theropods. Highly aggressive. 

LUCAS	Dinosaurs?

KATE 	You keep asking me that. 

LUCAS 	Man, I must have hit my head harder than I thought.

KATE 	You were actually quite lucky. 

KATE 	Usually a person in your position would have been torn to shreds.

LUCAS	So you saw my plane?

KATE 	No, I'm talking about the dromaeosaurs. 

KATE 	You see 

KATE 	male dromaeosaurs often collect bright coloured objects 

KATE 	in order to attract a mate. 

KATE 	They particularly like blue things. 

LUCAS 	This is nuts. 

LUCAS	Right, okay. 

LUCAS	I know what’s going on here. 

LUCAS	I'm asleep. 

LUCAS	This is all just a dream. 

LUCAS	Wake up, Lucas. Wake up!

KATE 	Really, you must stop that. 

KATE 	You're becoming rather hysterical. 

KATE 	I know this all sounds a little strange

KATE 	but you really must adapt to the situation. 

KATE 	You're going to have to learn fast if you want to survive here.

LUCAS	Survive here? I'm not staying here. 

LUCAS	Look, I appreciate you saving me from those dromedary things.

KATE 	Dromaeosaurs. Avian nos ungulate.
   	    	
LUCAS 	Whatever. Look, you seem like a really nice girl

LUCAS	but I've got to go and find my plane. 

LUCAS	Thanks again for saving me. 

LUCAS	Glad we could have this little chat, but I think I'd better go.

KATE 	You can’t just go wandering around at dusk. 

KATE 	It’s far too dangerous. 

KATE 	You won’t last the night out there.

LUCAS	Yep. Okay, thanks.

LUCAS 	Sheesh, what a head case. 

LUCAS 	Okay Lucas, think. 

LUCAS 	Find the plane. 

LUCAS 	Wait for rescue.

LUCAS 	Get a grip, Lucas. 

LUCAS 	It’s probably just a big old cow.

KATE 	Hadrosaur, actually. And that was a distress call. 

KATE 	Look, it really isn’t safe. I think you should stay here tonight.

KATE 	Come on, the forest is no place for us after dark.
 
KATE 	I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable before. 

KATE 	It’s just I haven’t spoken to anyone in such a long time. 

KATE 	I almost feared I'd forgotten how to. 

LUCAS	That’s okay. 

LUCAS	How long have you been here?

KATE 	Several years, I think.

LUCAS	So you haven’t seen anyone in years?  You really need to get out more.

KATE  	I get out every day to further my work.

KATE	My dream is to one day win a Nobel Prize for science.

KATE	Mimos, there you are. 

KATE	It’s okay, he’s a friend.

LUCAS	What is that thing?

KATE	Mimos, meet Lucas.

LUCAS	I've never seen a bird like this before.

KATE  	Well of course you haven’t. No one has. 

KATE 	He’s a Sinonithosaur.

LUCAS	Hey little guy.

KATE 	I think you gave him a fright. 

LUCAS	Did he just make all that noise?

KATE  	Why yes, that’s how he got his name.

KATE 	Mimos is from the Latin word for mime. 

KATE 	He can reproduce any sound that he hears

KATE 	just like a modern day lyre bird.

KATE 	Although I think he’s far more talented, aren’t you Mimos?

MIMOS	That is correct. 

LUCAS 	What are those for? 

LUCAS 	That is disgusting! 

KATE  	We eat what we can here.

KATE 	Try one.

KATE 	Just kidding. 

KATE 	Actually we have plenty of food here 

KATE 	and there’s always supplies that come through the mist.

LUCAS	Delightful. 

KATE 	Take a look at this. 

KATE 	It’ll bring you up to speed. 

LUCAS 	What is it? 

KATE 	It’s my diary.

LUCAS	Why do I have to read your diary? 

KATE 	Don’t worry, it’s not full of girly memoirs or anything. 

KATE 	It’s a record of everything I've learned to date.

KATE 	Think of it like a survival guide. 

LUCAS	Survival guide?

KATE 	Just read it. 

LUCAS	Kathryn Rose – 

KATE 	Kate. I prefer Kate.

KATE 	Kathryn sounds so old fashioned.

LUCAS	Kate Rose Thompson. Birthday th June . 

LUCAS	? 

LUCAS 	I think you gave me the wrong book. 

KATE 	No, that’s it. 

LUCAS	?

KATE  	Yes, I'll be  next month. 

LUCAS	? Try like . It’s . 

MIMOS 	That is all.

KATE 	Really? 

KATE 	Curious. 

KATE 	That’s the second craft from that century.

LUCAS	Okay, so you mean to tell me that you're from ? 

KATE 	I was born in . 

KATE 	It’s  where I come from.

LUCAS	Right, of course it is.

KATE 	As I said, the question of when we are is just as perplexing as where.

KATE 	Are you hungry? 

KATE 	I'm going to go fix us some food.

LUCAS 	I've got to find a way out of here.

LUCAS 	Where are we?

LUCAS 	Orion, Cannes Major, Carina.

LUCAS  	The Crux Constellation. 

LUCAS 	Dad, you always told me to use what I know. 

LUCAS 	But right now, I ... 

LUCAS  	I don't know anything.

LUCAS 	I'm totally lost.

LUCAS 	Whoa! 

LUCAS 	What the? 

LUCAS 	Cool.

KATE 	What on earth are you doing with my diary?

LUCAS	Defending myself from a gigantic centipede. 

KATE 	That’s not a centipede. 

KATE 	That’s an arthropleura! 

LUCAS	Well it was like ... 

LUCAS	And then I was like  

LUCAS	You should have seen it. It was massive.

LUCAS	I swear it was trying to eat me. 

KATE 	Don’t be dramatic. 

KATE 	It wasn’t going to eat you. 

KATE 	It might have given you a nasty bite but ... 

LUCAS	What, like a nasty life-ending bite?

KATE 	Don’t be ridiculous. 

KATE 	At worst you might experience severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea - 

LUCAS	Enough. I get the picture. 

KATE 	This one was just a baby.

KATE 	It must have hatched while I was out. 

LUCAS	A baby?

KATE 	I found the egg weeks ago.

LUCAS	And so you brought that here? 

KATE 	I was going to study it.

KATE 	I gave you this to read, not to use as a swat. 

KATE 	What a mess. 

LUCAS	Hey, I'm sorry. 

LUCAS	It’s not like I had any other options. 

LUCAS	One minute I'm checking out your glowy things

LUCAS	and the next I'm being attacked by that - 

KATE	Arthropleura!  Exactly. 

KATE  	Curious.

KATE 	I've never seen one up this close before.

KATE 	Mandibles, secondary, maxillipeds. 

KATE 	It’s remarkable. 

LUCAS	Yeah, remarkably disgusting. 

KATE 	I thought boys were supposed to be into this sort of stuff. 

KATE 	lime, snails and all that.

KATE 	Relax, it’s dead. 

KATE 	See there, behind its pincers?

KATE 	Those gourd-like shapes? 

KATE 	Those are its venom glands. 

LUCAS 	They look kind of lethal.

KATE 	They are remarkably developed for a creature this size.

KATE  	Probably best it didn’t bite you. 

KATE 	Actually, it’s remarkably similar to - 

KATE 	Kill it!

LUCAS	You kill it. I already killed it!

LUCAS	See? I told you. 

LUCAS	I had nothing else to hit it with. 
KATE 	Well, I guess we managed to accurately capture the moment. 

KATE 	So, tell me. 

KATE 	What’s life like in ?

LUCAS	Look, I don’t mean to be rude

LUCAS	but you seriously don’t expect me to buy this time travel stuff, do you?

KATE 	Well, I'm afraid there’s no other explanation for it.

LUCAS	I can think of a few.

KATE 	Look, I'll show you.

KATE 	Look at the dates.

KATE 	London News, December .

KATE 	Pix, May . 

KATE 	That’s not for another two years.

LUCAS	Okay, so you got a bunch of old newspapers. 

LUCAS	That hardly proves your time travel theory.

KATE 	How about this? 

KATE 	Daily Post, October .

LUCAS	Give me that. 

LUCAS	Where’d you get this? 

KATE 	It came in a cargo plane a few weeks ago. 

KATE 	Tell me, do you still have television? 

KATE	I checked the guide in that paper but it was missing.
	
LUCAS	?

KATE	I don’t have television here, but I make my own entertainment. 

KATE 	I like to read my letters. 

KATE 	Sometimes when planes come through the mist, they carry mail with them. 

KATE 	Letters are fascinating. 

LUCAS	You read people’s mail? 

LUCAS	Isn’t that like a federal offence?

KATE 	Well, I know it could be considered improper, but so much effort goes into these letters. 

KATE 	It would be a shame for them to go unread.

LUCAS	Dear Mum Not that one, sorry. That one’s private.

LUCAS 	Alright.

LUCAS	John Stevenson, National Fungus Collection

LUCAS	Bureau of Plant Industry.

KATE 	That’s one of my absolute favourites. 

KATE 	It’s really quite funny. 

KATE	Dear Mr. Stevenson

KATE	I seek your urgent assistance with one of the most delicate matters.

KATE	A few weeks back 

KATE 	a patient of mine came to me with a highly aggressive form of fungal infection

KATE 	the likes of which I've never seen before.

KATE 	My usual treatments have failed and the fungus has rapidly increased in size.

KATE	It now sports growth in the form of flowering spores from the patient’s posterior.

LUCAS 	A flowering butt fungus.

LUCAS	That is disgusting. 

KATE  	Wait, it goes on. 

KATE 	One hundred and fifty patients now exhibit the early stages of the infection 

KATE 	and I fear we may be in the midst of an epidemic. 

KATE	Please give this matter your most urgent attention.

KATE 	Yours sincerely, Doctor Gardiner Shaw, Pullman, Wash.

LUCAS	Pullman Wash? 

LUCAS	Sounds like they all need a good wash. 

KATE 	Wash is actually short for Washington.

LUCAS	Washington, the butt fungus capital of the world. 

KATE 	It’s getting late. 
	
KATE 	I took the liberty of making you a place to sleep. 

KATE 	Come on.

KATE 	Here, this one’s from Paris.

KATE	Paris. 

KATE 	It sounds so romantic. 

KATE 	I hope to visit there one day.

KATE 	To my sweetheart

KATE	we have now crossed France and have arrived in Paris. 

KATE	The weather is surprisingly warm for this time of the year

KATE	and flowers are blooming everywhere, lilacs especially. 

KATE	I took a delightful tour of the Eiffel Tower

KATE	the tomb of Napoleon and inside the Louvre

KATE	where most of the works of art have been removed for safe keeping.

KATE 	Goodnight, future boy. 

KATE 	Sweet dreams.

LUCAS	Close the window, Mum.

LUCAS	Kate, wake up!	

LUCAS	Wake up! 

LUCAS	Kate, wake up!

LUCAS	Wake up! 

KATE 	Supplies. 

LUCAS	Supplies? 

LUCAS	What? 

LUCAS	Wake up, it’s an earthquake!

KATE 	Stop that! I'm wide awake. 

KATE 	It’s the mist, silly, and that’s an aeroplane.

LUCAS	What?

LUCAS	Whoa, what is that?

KATE 	A cargo plane. 

KATE 	The best sort.

LUCAS	The passengers. They’ll be injured.

KATE 	Don’t worry, there won’t be any. 

KATE 	The planes are always empty. 

LUCAS	Empty? What do you mean, empty? 

LUCAS	Planes don’t just fly themselves.

LUCAS	What about the crew?
  	   	
KATE 	I don't know, but there’s never anyone on board. 

LUCAS	Never?  Nope. 

LUCAS 	There’s always lots of swell stuff, though.

LUCAS	Hang on. 

LUCAS	If there’s never anyone on board, then how did we get here?

KATE 	I don't know.

KATE 	Time to go.

LUCAS	Go? Go where?

KATE 	To get the cargo, of course.

LUCAS	I'm not going anywhere. 

LUCAS	I'm going to locate my plane and get out of here.

KATE 	Look, there. 

KATE 	Go ahead, look.

LUCAS	What am I looking at?

KATE 	What do you see?

LUCAS	Nothing.

KATE 	Precisely. 

KATE 	That’s where you landed yesterday. 

KATE 	I saw you down on the beach after the mist appeared. 
KATE 	Just you, no one else.

LUCAS	Wait, I see footprints. 

LUCAS	Oh, there’s only one set.

LUCAS	They’re mine, aren’t they?

KATE 	Come on, we really must go. 

LUCAS	What’s that sound?

LUCAS	What is it? 

KATE 	You'll see. 

LUCAS	Those those are dinosaurs! 

KATE 	Magnificent, aren’t they? 

KATE 	Bernissartensis iguanodons. 

LUCAS 	This is incredible. 

LUCAS	Those are like ... 

LUCAS	Like real! 

KATE 	They’re my absolute favourite.

KATE 	Look there.

LUCAS	Babies?

KATE 	Let’s get a closer look.

LUCAS 	Won’t they eat us?

KATE  	No, they're herbivores. 

KATE  	Gentle creatures.

LUCAS	This is amazing.

LUCAS	Hey little guy.

KATE 	It’s a girl, actually. 

KATE 	Around ten days old. 

KATE	Go on. 

KATE	We don’t want to make Mummy mad.

KATE	Go on.

LUCAS	So this mist thing 

LUCAS	is randomly pulling things in from all over the place?

KATE  	Everything that’s here has come from some other place

KATE 	or some other time.

KATE  	You and I, for example. 

KATE 	And even the dinosaurs.

LUCAS 	And where does it come from?

KATE 	All I know is that it appears regularly but never at the same time. 

KATE	Sometimes at night and sometimes during the day. 

KATE	And more often than not, things come through it.

  	  	
LUCAS 	Okay, so we have mist, we have seismic activity

LUCAS 	we have radio noise 

LUCAS	and we have craft from all over the place.

LUCAS	Which all adds up to one thing! 

KATE 	Yes?

LUCAS	I am completely lost with absolutely no way of getting home.

KATE 	Cheer up. Look on the bright side.

LUCAS	What bright side? 

KATE 	Well, at least you don’t have to go to school, for one thing.

LUCAS	I like school. 

LUCAS	At least at school I'm not likely to be dino food by the end of first period. 

KATE 	Don’t worry. 

KATE 	Just stay close. 

LUCAS	Oh my goodness!

LUCAS	Wow. 

LUCAS	This is incredible. 

LUCAS	Man, look at all this stuff. 

LUCAS	Oh my gosh! 

LUCAS	There’s enough chocolate in here to last us a lifetime.

KATE 	I was hoping to find something a bit more useful than confectionary. 

LUCAS	Useful? 

LUCAS	What’s more useful than chocolate? 

LUCAS	Man, we’ve just hit the motherlode. 

LUCAS 	This is like the best meal I've had in days.

LUCAS	Do you know 

LUCAS 	a woman lived to  by eating a kilo of chocolate every week? 

KATE 	I don’t really like chocolate.

LUCAS	Okay, you're officially the weirdest girl I've ever met. 

LUCAS	I mean, who doesn’t like chocolate? 

LUCAS	Oh, I love chocolate. I love it so much. 

LUCAS 	I'd marry it and I'd put it up on a condo on the beach 

LUCAS 	and that’d be made out of chocolate

LUCAS 	and even the fridge would be made out of chocolate, because 

LUCAS 	if you ran out of chocolate in the fridge

LUCAS 	you could just eat the fridge.

KATE 	Okay, I think the heat here is starting to get to you. 

KATE 	You're starting to lose it.

LUCAS	I'm not losing a thing. 

LUCAS	I'm keeping these beauties safe and sound, right here on my person. 

TRIBAL CHILD	Hey, come come come come come!

KATE 	Something’s here.

KATE 	Clean yourself up, for goodness sake! 

TRIBAL LEADER 	See em a! Vo do gosh! Vooli up! Vooli up! 

TRIBAL CHILD	Aye! Gugum gugum gugum.
 
TRIBAL LEADER	Lamelu legohon melelu go salem male ra, run! 

KATE 	Let go of me!

LUCAS 	Let go of me. Let go of me!

TRIBAL CHILD 	No gar to wo!

TRIBAL CHILD # 1	Fasil! 

TRIBAL CHILD # 2	Fasil! 

TRIBAL CHILD # 3	Fasil!

TRIBAL MEMBER 	Eh, Jihal, Fasil lose! 

TRIBAL LEADER 	Fasil lose? 

TRIBAL LEADER 	Gole hoju male go joomin. Gole goju mal. 

TRIBAL LEADER 	Stupid!

LUCAS 	What is that smell? 

LUCAS	Oh, someone here needs a bath.

KATE 	It’s the flowers.

LUCAS	Flowers. Really? Are you sure?

KATE 	Nepenthes. 

LUCAS	Smells like a bouquet of armpits.

KATE 	Fungi Carnivora.

KATE 	This is not good. 

LUCAS	Kate?

KATE 	Let’s go!

LUCAS 	Kate, help! 

KATE 	Lucas!

KATE 	Grab hold!

KATE 	Lucas, it’s got me!

TRIBAL LEADER	Lem godum tu la!

KATE 	I demand you let us out right now! 

KATE 	Let us out, now!  

LUCAS	Don’t worry, I'll figure out a way to get out of here.

ERNEST	Sing sing stone. 

LUCAS  	Whoa!

ERNEST 	Gee jis stone where?

LUCAS 	Relax! It’s just a lump of rock.

ERNEST	You must have a sing sing stone. 

LUCAS 	Sav ert?

ERNEST	You no understand dem sing sing stone. 

LUCAS	Actually, I understand quite a bit. 

ERNEST 	Oh, so you think you sav ert sing sing stone betten me?

LUCAS 	Huh? 

LUCAS 	It’s just a plain old clump of quartz.

LUCAS 	Look, I mean no disrespect

LUCAS 	but I'm really not in the mood for hearing fairytales right now.

LUCAS	How are you doing that?

LUCAS 	What is it?

ERNEST 	Sing sing stone make em small  cloud.

LUCAS 	It looks like the mist.

ERNEST	Yes, it’s the mist. Yous have a mist. 

ERNEST 	Watch it. 

LUCAS 	t’s hot! 

ERNEST 	Yes, it’s hot. 

LUCAS 	?

LUCAS 	Whoa! 

ERNEST  	Yes yes, you see this one? 

ERNEST 	It come from a place long way.

ERNEST	Sing sing stone, bring im a place here.

LUCAS 	So this sing sing stone, it causes the mist.

LUCAS 	Are there more of these?

ERNEST 	Oh yes yes. Big, big sing sing stone.

LUCAS 	Where? Where are they? 

ERNEST 	Oh, place long way, long way, very long way.

ERNEST	My people return to home place 

ERNEST	through the  mist. 

ERNEST 	Sing sing stone take them there.

LUCAS 	Where? How do I get there?
ERNEST  	Do you want to go to your village?

LUCAS 	Yes, yes, my village.

LUCAS 	My people. 

ERNEST 	Very dangerous. 

ERNEST 	Big fire. Fire twin. 

ERNEST 	Under fire twin, you find your way.

LUCAS 	What I need to do now is figure out a way to get out of this cage.

ERNEST 	Oh, cage. 

ERNEST 	There is a way.

ERNEST 	Up there. 

LUCAS	Kate, wake up. We’re getting out of here.

LUCAS	Are you crazy? What are you doing?

LUCAS 	Whoa, easy boy.

KATE 	What do you think you're doing?

LUCAS	What are you complaining about? I saved us, didn’t I?

KATE 	You're going to get us killed.

LUCAS	I'm going to get us killed? Are you kidding me? 

LUCAS 	My plan was to sneak away quietly

LUCAS	not to release a flock of angry birds!

KATE 	This animal’s just juvenile. 

LUCAS	Whoa!

KATE 	It’s probably never flown before. 

KATE 	It still has feathers.

LUCAS	How was I supposed to know? 

LUCAS	In my world, if it has feathers, it can fly.

KATE 	These feathers are little more than natal down. 

KATE 	Pterosaurs lose these when they reach maturity.

LUCAS	Look, it was better than being tortured by a tribe of angry natives. 

LUCAS	But then, you knew all about the natives long before they found us

LUCAS	didn’t you Kate?

LUCAS 	That’s right, I know that you obviously don’t want me to find my way home. 

LUCAS	Well you know what, Kate?

LUCAS	I have things to live for, I have people that care about me.

LUCAS 	I'm sorry you don’t, but I have a life. 

LUCAS	I have a good life, and I'm going to get it back.

KATE 	Look, I'm sorry. 

KATE	It’s probably my fault that we’re in this predicament. 

LUCAS	Probably? 

KATE 	I can be a little impulsive at times. 

KATE 	I couldn’t bear the thought of being alone again.

KATE 	And I can’t go back, I just can’t.

KATE 	There’s still so much I need to understand. 

KATE 	Like the pterosaurs.

KATE 	Aren’t they the most graceful creatures you’ve ever seen? 

LUCAS	Oh my goodness.

KATE  	I know. 

KATE 	Look at the way their wings effortlessly direct the air over - 

LUCAS	No, not that! Forget the birds. 

LUCAS	Look! There!

LUCAS	The twin fire mountains! 

LUCAS	He was talking about the volcanoes. 

LUCAS	‘Beneath the fire twins you will find your way.’ 

LUCAS	The conditions would be perfect for massive crystal growth.

KATE 	Fire mountains? Crystals? 

KATE 	What are you talking about? 

LUCAS	Ernest. Ernest and his singing stones. 

LUCAS	He was trying to describe a massive piezoelectric crystal cluster. 

LUCAS	The seismic activity must cause it to attain its resonant frequency. 

KATE 	I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

LUCAS	I'll explain everything

LUCAS	but first I have to get this little guy to change course.

LUCAS 	That’s it, easy boy!

LUCAS 	No, no no no, we’re trying to go this way.

KATE 	What are you doing?

KATE 	You'll never get it away from its flock.

LUCAS	We’ll see about that. Hold on!

KATE 	He’s flying too low!

KATE 	Lucas! 

KATE 	Lucas! 

LUCAS	Over here.

KATE 	Are you okay? 

LUCAS	That was awesome. 

KATE 	What on earth were you thinking?

LUCAS	What I was thinking 

LUCAS	was we could get out of here.

KATE 	Well now we need to figure out where here is.

LUCAS	Exactly . miles south east of the volcanoes. 

LUCAS	I triangulated our position before we crashed. 

LUCAS	What? 

LUCAS	I took a celestial navigation class online. 

LUCAS	I was bored. 

LUCAS	Forget it. Come on. 

KATE 	We have to get back to the treehouse before nightfall.

LUCAS	We’re not going back to the treehouse.

KATE 	What?

LUCAS	We’re going to the volcanoes. 

LUCAS	We should reach the ash plain within a few hours. 

LUCAS	From there it should be pretty easy going

LUCAS	unless you want to get Junior back there up in the air again?

KATE 	Lucas Winton! 

KATE 	I'm not taking another step until you explain to me exactly where you think you're going and why.

LUCAS	Here, take a look at this.

KATE 	Whatever for? 

LUCAS	Look at it. What do you see?

KATE 	It’s just a plain old crystal.

KATE 	I used to have one just like it. 

LUCAS	There’s nothing plain about it. Take a look at this.

KATE 	What is it?

LUCAS	Keep watching. 

KATE 	It looks just like the mist.

LUCAS	It is the mist, but the mist is simply a by-product.

LUCAS 	Keep watching. 

KATE  	Oh my goodness!

KATE 	 Where did it come from? I don't know.

KATE 	That was incredible. 

LUCAS	Now imagine hundreds of these, but bigger. 

LUCAS	Something like that could create enough energy to make an electrostatic mist 

LUCAS	to cover over hundreds of miles.

LUCAS	You see 

LUCAS 	somewhere beneath those volcanoes 

LUCAS	is a huge cluster of these things that’s pulling everything in. 

LUCAS	This is our key to getting out of here. 

LUCAS	This is our way home! 

KATE 	Okay, but as you rightly pointed out, the mist pulls things in. 

KATE 	I've never witnessed anything being pulled out.

LUCAS	I think that’s just a matter of changing the frequency or polarity. 

LUCAS	Kind of like tuning your radio. 

LUCAS	A radio, of course! The radio noise! 

LUCAS	Why didn’t I think of this before?

KATE 	What?

LUCAS	You saw what just happened.

LUCAS	It’s Newton’s Third Law. 

LUCAS	‘For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.’ 

LUCAS	So we tune in to the correct resonance frequency

LUCAS	reverse the polarity of the piezoelectric charge and booyah! we're out of here.
	
KATE  	How do you propose we do whatever it is you just said?

LUCAS	I don’t quite know, but I'm going to find out.

LUCAS	So, what do you say?

KATE 	Run!

LUCAS	It’s gaining on us!

LUCAS	Kate, what do we do?

LUCAS	Junior! 

KATE 	Now we’re completely lost.

LUCAS	Don’t worry. We’re actually not that far off track. 

LUCAS	Help me find a straight stick. 

KATE 	Will this do? 

LUCAS 	Perfect.

LUCAS 	This will give me an east-west line.

LUCAS	From there, I can figure out exactly where we are.

KATE	Now what?  We wait. 

KATE 	What are waiting for, exactly?

LUCAS	The sun to move. 

LUCAS 	Oh, come on! We need that.

KATE 	He’s a baby. He wants to play. 

LUCAS	This is no time for games. 

LUCAS	We’ve got to get our bearings and get out of here. 


LUCAS 	Shoo! Go! Go and play!

LUCAS	Oh great, now he’s crying. 

KATE 	That’s not great, actually. 

KATE  	He’s attracted unwanted attention.

KATE 	What are you doing?

LUCAS	It can’t see us if we don’t move.

KATE  	Where did you get that ridiculous notion? 

KATE 	It can see you just fine. Come 

LUCAS 	Kate!

KATE 	Follow me! 

KATE 	Run diagonally. It’ll slow it down.

KATE 	Head for the herd! 

LUCAS	I think we lost it.

LUCAS	Quick! Go!

LUCAS	Go go go go go!

LUCAS 	Yeah!

LUCAS 	You're not so tough now, are you?

LUCAS  	In your face! 

KATE	Mimos!

LUCAS 	How did he get here? 

KATE  	He has a tendency to turn up in the most odd places.

MIMOS	That is correct. 

LUCAS  	Yeah!

LUCAS 	That’s right, you better run! 

LUCAS	Well, I sure showed him who’s boss.

LUCAS	Wow.

KATE 	This is incredible. 

KATE 	I can’t believe it.

KATE 	I've never seen this many wrecks before.

KATE  	So where are these crystals of yours?

LUCAS	We’re probably standing on a lot of them right now

LUCAS 	but the concentrated source is right beneath those volcanoes.

LUCAS	That’s where we’re headed.

KATE 	We’re not going anywhere near them.

LUCAS	Come on, this is your chance to show the world what you know.

LUCAS	Don’t worry, we’ll be fine. Just stay close.

KATE 	What? 

LUCAS	It’s those things that attacked me back in the forest.

KATE 	Raptors!

LUCAS	Mimos, no!

LUCAS 	Mimos, no! 

LUCAS	No no no no, Mimos! 

KATE 	No! Mimos! 

LUCAS	Run! 

LUCAS 	Kate!
	
LUCAS	Kate! 

LUCAS	Go go go go go!

LUCAS 	Wow, we found it! 

LUCAS	This is it! 

LUCAS	I knew it had to be here, I just knew it. 

KATE  	I have to say this is rather remarkable 

KATE 	but how can you be sure it’s going to get us home?

LUCAS	Oh, it’ll get us home alright. 

LUCAS	This is what has been pulling everything in.

LUCAS	The ships, the planes, everything. 

KATE  	But how?

LUCAS	I'm pretty sure it’s caused by the seismic activity.

KATE 	What do you mean?

LUCAS	The quakes.

KATE 	Okay, so you're saying that the earthquakes caused the crystals to create the mist.

LUCAS	Sort of.

LUCAS	An earthquake vibrating at just the right frequency 

LUCAS	will cause the crystals to generate a piezo-electric discharge.

KATE 	Okay, assuming for starters that I understood any of that

KATE 	you're not suggesting that we wait for another earthquake, are you?

KATE 	What are you doing?

LUCAS	Perfect. 

LUCAS	You’ll see.

LUCAS 	Do we have any water left?

KATE 	Water? Yes.

LUCAS	Little bit more.

LUCAS	Come on. 

LUCAS 	It’s working!
LUCAS	It’s working! I told you it’d work! 

KATE 	Oh my goodness! 

LUCAS 	This is our way out of here. 

LUCAS	We’re gonna get home!

LUCAS	Kate, he’s got Mimos. 

KATE 	I have an idea.

KATE 	Come on.

KATE  	That’s it. You want it.

KATE 	Come on, you want it?

KATE 	Come and get it.

KATE	Mimos! 

KATE	No! Mimos!

LUCAS 	Kate. 

KATE	Mimos!

LUCAS 	I'm so sorry. 

LUCAS	Come on, I'll take you home. 

LUCAS	I'll take you back to the treehouse. 

KATE 	What?

LUCAS	The jar, it’s gone.

LUCAS	It can’t attain resonance. 

KATE 	Use what you know. I know you can. 

LUCAS	I can’t.

LUCAS	Kate, look!

KATE 	Mimos!

LUCAS	tka He’s okay! 

LUCAS 	Kate, he’s activating the crystals! 

KATE 	Quick Mimos, it’s okay. 

KATE	Go! Go home.

LUCAS	Quick, it’s happening. We’ve got to go.

KATE 	I've got to get the diary.

LUCAS 	But the portal’s opening!

KATE 	I can’t reach it.

LUCAS 	Kate, leave it. Forget the diary.

LUCAS	We’ve got to go! 

LUCAS	Come on!

LUCAS	This is it. This is it! 

LUCAS	We’re finally going to get out of here. 


LUCAS	We’re gonna get home! 

KATE 	I have to get the diary.

LUCAS	What? 

KATE 	I have to go back. 

LUCAS	There’s no time. You’ll never make it.

KATE 	I have to try. 

KATE 	I can’t go home without it. 

KATE 	No one will ever believe me. Don’t you see? 

KATE 	The diary is a record of everything here. It’s my only proof. 

LUCAS	What are you talking about? I'm your proof. 

LUCAS	I've seen everything you’ve seen. 

LUCAS	I know everything you know.

KATE 	What do you know, Lucas? 

KATE 	I mean, what do you really know for sure? 

KATE 	What can you prove? 

KATE 	You see, we can’t prove anything. 

KATE 	The world needs proof. 

KATE 	Without it, all we have is crazy stories. 

KATE 	Without proof, in time, even if it comes out what we’ve seen here. 

KATE 	I can’t live like that. 

KATE 	I'll be fine. 	

KATE 	I'll be right behind you.

LUCAS	No! 

LUCAS 	Kate, wait!

NEWSREADER 	So we have no idea 

NEWSREADER 	where this mystery island has appeared from

NEWSREADER 	but it could actually just be a sort of cartographic error 

NEWSREADER 	all the way back to the CIA. 

NEWSREADER 	So that sort of raises all sorts of conspiracy ... 

MUM 	Sweetheart, you're awake. 

MUM 	How’re you feeling?

LUCAS	Mum, I had a really bizarre dream.

LUCAS	There was a treehouse and a girl

LUCAS	the the crystals. Dad, the crystals.

DAD 	Take it easy, Lucas.

DAD 	You’ve had quite an ordeal. 


MUM 	We’ll be back soon, sweetie. 

MUM 	We’re just going to go talk to the doctors. Okay? 

LUCAS	Nana Katherine. 

LUCAS	What are you doing here? 

LUCAS	I thought you were in that place. They said you were sick.

KATE 	Kate. 

KATE 	I prefer Kate. 

KATE 	Katherine’s so old fashioned.

LUCAS	Kate?

NANA 	I told you I'd be right behind you.

HOST 	it is with great pleasure that I welcome to the stage 

HOST 	this year’s recipient 

HOST 	of the Nobel Prize for achievement in science 

HOST 	Doctor Kate Rose Thompson.

KATE 	Thank you. 

KATE 	It’s been a dream of mine since I was very young to win this award. 

KATE 	It’s a great honour, a great honour.

KATE 	My team and I have verified the discovery 

KATE 	of a living Arthropleura 

KATE 	and so many other creatures thought to be extinct.

KATE 	We’ve done this 

KATE  	through the successful extraction and analysis

KATE 	taken from the specimen 

KATE 	so carefully preserved 

KATE 	in my old blue field diary.

JOURNALIST 	Doctor Thompson

JOURNALIST	how do you feel about the few critics out there 

JOURNALIST 	who claim that this is merely a genus of giant centipede? 

ATE 	That, my dear, is not a centipede. 

KATE 	It’s an Arthropleura.
