THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching..? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	We all know that Thomas and Bertie like to race. But what happens when Bertie's road crosses Thomas' tracks? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Sometimes Bertie uses a bridge, to take him over the tracks... 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Sometimes he uses a level crossing. Thomas has to wait at the gate until Bertie is safely across!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Why did Thomas stop? To let Bertie cross the level crossing? To let Bertie over the bridge? Or to wait for some sheep on the line?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Thomas stopped to let Bertie cross the level crossing!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh and he doesn't look too pleased about it does he? Never mind, Thomas. Next time I'm sure Bertie will have to stop at the crossing gates to wait for you!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray! That was fun! Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Thomas has a very special job to do today. He's taking a team of Railway Inspectors around the island.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Ho hoo... There are rather a lot of Inspectors, aren't there? But I suppose Sodor is quite a large island, so there are lots of things to inspect.

THE EARL OF SODOR	How many inspectors were there? Were there two Inspectors? Were there three inspectors? Or were there four inspectors? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	There were three Inspectors inspecting the Island!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh, very good work, Belle! And I'm sure those inspectors will give you top marks for putting out that fire!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh, jolly well done for playing! I look forward to seeing you again next time. Goodbye!
