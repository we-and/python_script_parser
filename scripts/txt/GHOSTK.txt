RENATO	Catarina. Catarina. Catarina. 

DANIEL	Renato! Open the door! Open it, dude! Open the door! Renato! Somebody help! 

RENATO	What's happening to you? 

DANIEL	Got you all scared, didn't I?|I was just kidding. 

RENATO	Fuck you, man! 

DANIEL	I was just kidding, man.|Look, it's ketchup. 

NARRATOR	WARNING WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WAS|PERFORMED BY TRAINED GHOST HUNTERS. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. This gang is fascinated by the idea hat there are more things|in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of|in our philosophy. 

CAROLINE	Is anyone there?| If you can hear me, scream! 

NARRATOR	What started just as goofing around|became serious business for this crew. 

JACK	From this point on, I'm not|responsible for anyone's life. 

CAROLINE	I have a gift. They call me|the Brazilian Chico Xavier. I hope this is an arm. 

NARRATOR	PSYCHIC|SKILLS: SENSITIVITY, TAROT 

JACK	Unfortunately, I can't simply buy a gun|and shoot ghosts in the face, so I make nifty gadgets like this one! 

NARRATOR	{\an}SPECTRAL ENGINEER|SKILLS: STRATEGIST, INVENTOR 

FRED	A strong gust brought this down.|I don't think it was natural. If you're a ghost,|we're coming to hunt you! 

NARRATOR	{\an}LEADER|SKILLS: LEADERSHIP, COURAGE 

NARRATOR	The power of friendship gave them|the courage to face the unknown, and, together, they will prove|that ghosts do exist, and need to be exterminated. 

JACK/FRED/CAROLINE	We are the Ghoulbusters! 

FRED	This week, we are visiting a spooky|coffee farm from last century, on the hopes of|busting some ghosts! 

CAROLINE	This is a hanging spirit. They cry a lot,|and, since tears are wet… 

CAROLINE/FRED	This was a slave farm, right?| No, it was a coffee farm. 

FRED	Did you hear that? 

CAROLINE	It's coming from over there!| My God. Oh, my God! 

JACK	Whoa! 

FRED	Do you see what I'm seeing? 

CAROLINE	My God! 

NARRATOR	Can the Ghoulbusters bust the cursed|soul of the ghost of the coffee farm? 

FRED	We are in a site|full of haunted haunting ghosts, but I always have these|delicious cheese breads for whenever the forces of evil attack. It has that fresh farm taste. My God! Do you see what I'm seeing? Good God! Coward! Why are you|attacking this innocent old lady? Someone who would probably|die in a few months anyway? 

FRED/JACK	I'm going to get you!| No! 

JACK/CAROLINE	No, he needs help! 

JACK	He doesn't want help.|He will be exterminated! Eat this, jackass! 

TULIO/UNCLE	Hi there, uncle!| Don't you "hi there" me! 

UNCLE	How long will you|fool around with those bums? 

TULIO	Come on, uncle. They're my friends. 

UNCLE	Friends? They're just swindlers! You should get yourself a job.|A man's job! 

TULIO/UNCLE	Sorry.| Did I ever tell you about the ox that fell on top of me? 

TULIO/UNCLE	Yes, many times...| Then shut up, I will tell it again. 

UNCLE		So there I was, trying to get this ox,|since I worked with them. And then the ox came|and fell on top of me! How could I escape? Oxen are heavy! So I balled up my screwdriver like this, I pierced its hide|between its third and fifth ribs, and made my way through him|by ripping out his guts. I went through to the other side! 

TULIO	Nah, seeing blood makes me sick. 

UNCLE	You can't see blood,|but you have the guts to bring those clowns home? 

TULIO/UNCLE	 We're getting a TV deal.| What channel? 

TULIO/UNCLE	 They haven't said yet.| Probably Your Ass TV! 

UNCLE	I'm here because I respect my clients.|It's a man's job! 

TULIO	I know.| I… 

UNCLE	I'm always managing things with care. And tell your friends this:|I used to castrate cattle for a living. You know what I will do to you all|if you don't pay the rent? 

TULIO/UNCLE	 I will let them know.| You're on the list! 

TULIO	I will let them know! 

UNCLE	Bunch of punks. 

TULIO	Dear Christ... I don't want to lose my testicles.|I like them. Easy there, dog! Easy... Hey, guys. My UNCLE just told me that if|we don't pay the rent right now, he will kill you three|with a butcher knife. 

JACK	{\an}Do you think I'd have shown|that crap to TV stations if I had money? 

FRED	{\an}Looks like we will stay broke. {\an}We're making zilch|from monetization. Our videos|have fewer and fewer views. 

FRED/CAROLINE	Our last one had...| Twelve thousand views? 

FRED/CAROLINE	Yeah.| Knew it. 

FRED	See this Mannix chick? . million views. All she does is play games.|We should try that. We should make gameplay videos|of ghost games. 

CAROLINE/FRED	Those probably don't exist.| They probably do. 

FRED	Pac-Man! It has ghosts! 

JACK	You really don't get what's going on. We have to evolve with our viewers.|If they grew up, we should do the same. Let's get sophisticated. Like this. I call this baby|the Precision Exo-Gauntlet. I calibrated its aim myself.|I can hit anything at any range. Look. 

TULIO	Take it easy. 

FRED	Yeah, clearly it is your making. 

JACK	It also has a cool function. If you press this button… 

TULIO	Check out our latest video. Already about  hate memes from|Legendary Thanos in the comments. 

CAROLINE/JACK	Let's see.| I hate this Legendary Thanos. I bet he's some -year-old geezer|who still wears baseball caps and lives off the Web.|Must be such a loser. 

TULIO	But some of his comments make sense.|Like the one about our logo. Our logo really sucks.|The ghost looks drunk. 

FRED	That's why it's cool! 

TULIO/JACK	I sketched up a new one.| We're working here. 

TULIO	Just take a look.| It is serious. 

JACK	What else are they saying? 

FRED	That the best thing|in the video are Caroline's boobs. 

CAROLINE/FRED	Gross!| Kids will be kids. 

JACK	We need to make money fast!|Selling that pilot was our only shot. 

CAROLINE	Soon we shall get a call that will change our lives forever! 

JACK	Yeah, right. 

CAROLINE	See? I told you so! 

JACK/TULIO	The phone. Pick up the phone!| Sorry. 

TULIO	Ghoulbusters speaking. Right. I see. 

CAROLINE/FRED	Who was it?| Aren't you psychic? 

CAROLINE	Shut up, idiot. 

TULIO	They asked if it was the butcher shop, I said "yes", and he said: "so that's why there's|a cow in the window, losers!" And he hung up. 

FRED/TULIO	That was a great one!| And done as hell. 

FRED/JACK	Let's go have lunch!| Yes. 

JACK	We will refill our energy once we eat.|Also, it's Tuesday, so Túlio pays. 

TULIO	It's Wednesday. 

JACK	But it feels like Tuesday, so… 

CAROLINE	Lets go. 

NOGUEIRA	Hello? I am Principal Nogueira|at Isaac Newton High. I have a job for you. Please call me back at… 

JACK	Ghoulbusters speaking. 

FRED	Cramped parking spaces, aren't they? I think we bumped another car. 

JACK	Yeah, we did. 

CONAN	So you are the guys who imitate|the Ghostbusters. 

JACK	No. We don't "imitate" anyone. 

CONAN/JACK	 You don't?| No. 

CONAN	What about the ghost in the stop sign? 

JACK	That isn't a ghost. It's a ghoul. 

CONAN	What's the difference? 

JACK	"What's the difference?"|Tell him the difference. 

FRED	There is no difference! 

JACK	Yes, there is. The difference is that the Ghostbusters|have a ghost in a No Parking sign, while ours is in a Yield sign. 

CONAN	So you hunt ghouls,|but you yield to ghosts? 

CONAN/TULIO	 Whose dumb-ass idea was that?| That's what I’ve... 


CONAN	Come on. 

JACK/CONAN	You can't agree with him!| I can't believe this… 

CONAN	Sorry, pal. Not in my school. Not in my school. 

NOGUEIRA	Back where I lived,|we called her the Cotton Girl. Here, you know her as Bloody Mary. The name doesn't matter.|The spirit is the same. A tormented one. In order to summon her,|you just need to knock three times, flush three times,|and call her real name three times. And she appears. Yes, she does. In the bathroom mirror. Blond hair, cotton in her nostrils. One of our students summoned her.|Right here, in this school, and that put a curse on this place. Did you get that on tape? 

FRED/TULIO	Did you, Túlio?| No! You didn't tell me to! 

FRED/TULIO	Come on, man.| You did not tell me to! 

TULIO/NOGUEIRA	Now I'm recording.| No need to do that. 

NOGUEIRA	Turn off that piece of crap. Let's get down to business. One of our students had a seizure|in the bathroom this week. Now she's in a coma. Word got around,|and we started to worry… 

CAROLINE	I don't think it's an ordinary coma. I really felt a strange energy|coming from that bathroom. 

NOGUEIRA	Have you been using the students'|toilet again, Conan? And so, rumors spread.|Everyone talking about it. About how the school being haunted, the existance of the Cotton Girl|in the bathroom. 

JACK	And how can we help? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	I have a student who's|a big fan of your channel. 

FRED	We have many of those. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	In our school, I only know one. The point is: he convinced everyone else|and he started this petition asking you to kill Bloody Mary. 

NOGUEIRA	That's why I brought you here. So you can do your little shtick,|lift the school's spirits, and lessen the pain|of the kid who's in the ICU! 

CAROLINE	You shouldn't trivialize this,|Principal Nogueira. 

NOGUEIRA	She guessed my name,|and I hadn't told her! 

CONAN.CAROLINE	She read the plate on your desk.| What plate? 

CAROLINE	I didn't even notice he had a name plate! 

CAROLINE/TULIO	Look, our job is serious.| We're Ghoulbusters. 

FRED	And digital influencers. 

JACK	Anyway, what do you want us to do? 

NOGUEIRA	It's simple. Go to the schoolyard,|take a few pictures, give the kids autographs, and sign|a form saying you killed the ghost. Everybody's happy and back to class. 

FRED	Our job isn't as simple|as signing sick notes like a doctor. 

FRED/JACK	 We can't agree to...| Let me do the talking, okay? 

JACK	How much are we in for? 

NOGUEIRA/PROFESSORA HELENA	How much do we have left|from last year's June party? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	A thousand bucks. 

NOGUEIRA	Let's raise it a little. Like R$ ? So the three can have  each. 

TULIO	We're four, actually! I'm here too. 

JACK	Just let him speak. 

PROFESSORA HELENA/NOGUEIRA	Fifteen hundred.| Fifteen hundred. 

FRED	I think so… Deal… 

JACK	Let's be reasonable and use common sense. The souls of innocent kids are at stake! You can't put a price on that. 

JACK/NOGUEIRA	Forty thousand.| Excuse me? 

JACK	Forty thousand. 

FRED	Are you Crazy, man? 

NOGUEIRA	We've hired Barney the Dino|for less than that. He brought all of us so much joy. 

JACK	Take into consideration that|I'm not even charging my usual fee. This is just for the use|of special equipment, special soul fee and overnight stay, since we will have to stay overnight|to investigate this properly. 

NOGUEIRA	Forget it! I won't agree to that. No, sir. 

JACK	If a thief breaks into the school,|you call the cops. If the school's on fire,|you call the firemen. If that teacher there wants|to fix that mug of hers, you call Dr. But, against the supernatural,|you can only count on us. Forty thousand or no deal. 

FRED	Are you stupid? Those  hundred|would've come in handy for me! 

CAROLINE	No need to be a psychic|to see you'd fuck this up. 

JACK	I keep asking myself that: if Steve Jobs|had a mind as small as yours, would he have invented the cell phone? 

TULIO/JACK	Actually, he didn't invent...| Yes, he did! 

NOGUEIRA	Don't panic. That was just|a little something that went down. Just some food poisoning|from the cafeteria food. But since we all believe in ghosts here, I will receive the Devil over|a sanitary inspection any day. You're hired. 

JACK	You got yourself a deal.|Eighty thousand. 

NOGUEIRA/JACK	Fifteen hundred.| Forty thousand. 

NOGUEIRA/JACK	Fifteen hundred.| Fifteen thousand. 

NOGUEIRA/FRED	A thousand!| Deal. 

NOGUEIRA	I want you here|at seven o'clock in the morning. Then you will walk out that door|and give the kids' parents and the press a statement, saying that there's|no Bloody Mary, no Cotton Girl, no Devil, no|Chupacabra</i>, no nothing. 

FRED	I met this teacher just now.|An angel in a skirt. 

FRED/NOGUEIRA	Can she stay with us?| Sure! 

NOGUEIRA	Both her and Conan, our security guard. His shoe size is. And leave the school|just the way you found it. Clean and organized. Or else, I will make sure to personally introduce you and your little pals|to Satan himself! 

JACK	Just leave it to us! I will treat the school|as if it were my own house. Where's the rest of the stuff? 

TULIO	I'm coming. Just a second. I'm coming. 

JACK	Let's go over the plan! 

FRED	When did you catch a shadow around here? 

JACK	FRED will collect witness accounts|from the teachers. Túlio will turn on the|projector on the mirror and warn me when all is ready. I will take the teacher|to the bathroom, she will be|spooked, and we will run. We will go through the haunted hall,|find the ghost, and I will fight it. I will point my Exo-Ray Gauntlet|at its head and say: "Eat this, jackass!” 

FRED	What a load of crap. 

FRED/JACK	And that catchphrase sucks!| People love the catchphrase! 

FRED	We always try your plan,|and it always fails. I'm the leader,|so let me take the lead, kid. Stay quiet. So here's the plan. 

JACK	will turn on|the projector on the mirror and warn me when|everything's ready. I will take the teacher|to the bathroom, she will be|spooked, and we will run. We will go through the haunted hall,|find the ghost, and I will face it. We sell this pilot for TV|and become rich and famous. EAT THIS, JACKASS! 

CAROLINE	Where do I come in? 

FRED	Ask the spirit. 

JACK	This plan is garbage!|It doesn't even have a catchphrase, and you will end up being sued|for sexual harassment. 

FRED	Who hasn't been? 

CAROLINE	Why don't we just try to prove|that ghosts do exist? Seriously. 

JACK	Because we've been trying|to do that for  years and all we've proven is that people|who take ghosts seriously end up like you, a nutcase who talks to herself|like a crackhead. 

CAROLINE	I mean it, guys. As long as we got to do this,|we might as well do it for our friendship. That is what our opening line says. 

TULIO	"The power of friendship gave them|the courage to face the unknown, and, together, they will prove|to the world that ghosts do exist and need to be chased…" 

JACK	Well, I was waiting to give you this|after we were hired by a TV channel, but I guess it's okay|if we used it in the pilot. 

FRED	Dude! That's awesome! 

FRED/CAROLINE	Wow!| Real uniforms? 

TULIO	Seriously, Jackson? If you had money to order uniforms, why didn't you pay my uncle's rent? 

FRED	What are you, Broadway?|Everything's about "rent" with you! 

TULIO	Jesus Christ… 

JACK	I paid for these with a loan from an entrepreneur|who has a lot of faith in our work. 

UNCLE	Those good-for-nothing bums! 

TULIO	I got to to admit they do look cool. Don't you have one for me? 

JACK/TULIO	Yes, you do have a uniform.| Cool! 

TULIO	Dude, no way. I'm not playing the ghost again! 

FRED	Let go of your ego|and take this one for the team! 

TULIO	This is ridiculous!|It's the ghost of a -year-old girl! I'm a bearded -year-old man! 

JACK	You have a point.|-year-old girls don't have beards. 

FRED/TULIO	Yeah.| Of course they don’t. 

JACK	Take this. 

FRED	So we're all on the same page. Shall we? 

TULIO	No. I disagree! 

CAROLINE	You kidding? I'm not wearing this shit! If I wanted to show my boobs,|I'd be in a soap opera, not chasing ghosts with you bozos! 

FRED	Then you can wear whatever you want. 

TULIO	Can I wear whatever I want? 

FRED/JACK	No!| No! 

FRED	Cotton Girl? Or Bloody… 

TULIO	Testing sound. One, two, three. 

CONAN	What a bunch of losers. 

FRED	Cotton Girl? Bloody Mary? Or simply a myth? Based on recent|happenings in this school, she appears to be real. That's why we're going to investigate|every nook and cranny here in search of the real story. If you have the guts, come with us. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Are you going to take my statement now? 

FRED	Actually, I was thinking of interviewing|that lady teacher that is more... The one that is youn… 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Well, but the principal asked me|to stay with you tonight. 

JACK	Good God! Good God… 

TULIO/JACK	"Good God?" Aren't you an atheist?| Sorry… 

JACK/TULIO	Why no cotton in your nostrils?| Yeah, here's the thing. 

TULIO	Do I really need to shave? The camera is kind of far,|it won't really show. 

JACK	Do -year-old girls have beards? 

TULIO	Do -year-old girls have dicks? 

JACK	Just shave it. 

TULIO	Fine. 

FRED	It was right here, with this axe, that one of our country's most heinous|crimes was committed, in, and here we've also made contact|with the murderer's soul. What you're about to|see is frightening, scary... and sickening. But before you do,|smash that like button! Like, like, like! 

PROFESSORA RENATA	These guys are terrible. 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	That is what stupid teenagers like,|stupidity other idiots post on YouTube. 

PROFESSORA RENATA	Will that horror stuff|they're shooting be good? 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	Of course not! They're four idiots|making a horror movie. They're not even good comedians. There's not a single real actor in this. Just look at it,|they shoot it all at a single location. They don't have the budget to shoot|anywhere nicer, like a flowery park. 

PROFESSORA RENATA	At least the principal's paying us. He promised a bonus to whoever|stays to give a statement. 

PROFESSORA RENATA/PROFESSOR RICARDO	All I fear is making a fool of myself.| I don’t. 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	We are just giving statements.|We are like extras. Even if it ends up being crap,|it won't hurt my career. Plus, people say that, in horror movies, there's always steamy scenes|between extras like us. 

FRED	Jack, do you copy? I'm taking Mrs. Helena to the toilet to shoot the reenactment|and take her statement. 

JACK	Mrs. Helena? Talk about getting|the short end of the stick! You wanted the hot teacher|and you're stuck with that dog. Look, just distract her for a bit|while I fix the projector here. Don't bring her in here!|I will figure something out. 

FRED	I told you your plan was crap! 

CAROLINE	Oh, my God! It's happening! 

NOGUEIRA	What the fuck are those|bastards doing to my school? Son of a bitch! I will do it. I'm going there myself.|Eu vou matar 

FRED	Jack, I don't know what you did, but it kicked ass! I was almost scared! The old hag is shitting herself! I'm taking her to the classroom. Film me, okay? Just point the camera.|I look good from any angle. They say Bloody Mary's spirit|only appears in the bathroom, but I feel her presence right here. She's in her natural habitat. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	What was that? 

FRED	Calm down. Heard that? The noise|come from there. Come on. Don't make a sound.|Ghosts dislike certain sounds. Look. It's Bloody Mary! This is the first time a TV show|witnesses an actual ghost. Not counting the other times we did that. Looks real, doesn't it? Even the blood. The trick is not showing fear. 

FRED/PROFESSORA HELENA	 Did you see that?| I did! 

FRED	Did you see the footage we just caught? 

FRED/PROFESSORA HELENA	See how I ain't scared of anything?| I did… 

FRED/TULIO	Great job, man!| What? 

FRED/TULIO	You rocked in there!| Where? 

FRED/PROFESSORA HELENA	That TV deal is in the bag!| What is this joke? 

TULIO	The lights went out,|so I couldn't shave it all. 

TULIO/PROFESSORA HELENA	Does it look bad?| But why the dress? 

FRED	Don't worry, Túlio,|I will explain it to her. That was Túlio back there. It's called shooting. 

FRED/TULIO	When you see a ghost...| Wasn't me. 

FRED/TULIO	...you scream in fear.| I wasn't there. 

FRED	It's going great!|It's just what we needed! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	You're the one who doesn't understand! That thing back there|isn't from this world! 

FRED/TULIO	It was Túlio.| Fred. 

TULIO	I wasn't in that room. 

FRED	Caroline. Always trying to steal the show. Let's do it by ourselves. It's Bloody Mary, not Classroom Mary. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	I just don't understand… 

JACK	Our Father, who art in heaven,|hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... Amen. 

TULIO	Ouch! 

JACK	Shit, man...| Let's scram, now! 

FRED	Jack, that was good,|but I wasn't recording. Do it again, but don't be a ham. 

JACK	We have to leave, now! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Maybe we should leave, now. 

FRED	Learn this, teacher.|Running away isn't an option for a Ghoulbuster! 

TULIO	Caroline? 

FRED	Back to ruin our thing again? She botched our shooting downstairs|and now's she's back for more. Haven't you ever heard of teamwork? We are a team,|but she's always showing off. Fine, then. Do your little performance. I will just record it|and edit it out later. Hey, Túlio.|You were a lot better than her. It's so fake. She's just trembling! She's possessed by|the ghost of Parkinson's disease! At least throw up,|piss yourself or something. "Oh, no! I think I'm possessed! Nah, it's just bad acting." Forget a career in soap operas.|Comedy skits at best. 

TULIO	Blood? 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	Did you hear that? This area is like that.|When it starts raining, the old pipes get clogged,|the turds flow back, the wiring makes the lights blink,|bugs crawl up from gutters, it's hell. 

PROFESSORA RENATA	Gross. If this was a horror movie, now would|be time for the first victim to die. 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	With these guys? I doubt it. They'd probably make|one of those cliché horror movies where someone suddenly|touches somebody's shoulder just for a cheap scare… 

NOGUEIRA	Where are they?|And why aren't you with them? 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	They told us to wait here. 

NOGUEIRA/PROFSSORA RENATA	What about Conan?| He's probably with them. 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	Geez. 

FRED	We've just lost a team member! 

JACK	Help me open that door! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	I can't call anyone! There's no signal! 

JACK	Who you going to call? Ghostbusters? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	You have just opened the gates of Hell! 

JACK	There's got to be another way out! 

NOGUEIRA	Enough. No more shooting in this school. And I will keep your fee|as payment for the lamps you broke. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Principal, please, go to the hall and see with your own eyes|what happened to Caroline. You must see what happened to her! 

NOGUEIRA	Is this Caroline? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	No, it was… 

NOGUEIRA	This is just a bearded bum|wearing a dress. But if he sees himself as Caroline,|who am I to disagree? I will just have to accept it, otherwise|he will sue me because of gender bias. Caroline? Wake up! Come on! Wake up! 

JACK	My friend's head|just exploded right there. 

NOGUEIRA	You're telling me one head|squirted out all this blood? 

JACK/FRED	Yeah.| That's right. 

NOGUEIRA	What a big head. I always knew they were clowns, but you, teacher? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Principal, there really was a body there.  Please...| It was there! 

JACK/FRED	We got it all on video!| Show him!  It is recorded.| Watch it! 

NOGUEIRA	No more shooting! Thirty minutes. I want my school squeaky clean|in  minutes. Thirty minutes to leave|my school spotless! Or I will call the police. 

JACK/FRED	Oh, God!| Jesus Christ! 

TULIO/FRED	What happened?| I don't know! 

TULIO	Caroline's head exploded! She's dead! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Pull yourself together! 

JACK/FRED	 Bloody Mary.| Where? 

JACK	I saw her. She's real.|She escaped the mirror. You know me, I tried|to stop her, of course… 

TULIO	Here's what we should do: go back|to the bathroom where it all began and perform the summoning|ritual backwards. 

JACK/TULIO	We got to get out of here, he's raving.| I'm not! Just listen to me this time. If we do that, she will go back|to the world she was in and leave ours. It's so obvious! That is it! 

JACK	That is the single dumbest idea|I've ever heard. 

TULIO	If you had heard it in Stranger Things, you would think it was genius. 

NOGUEIRA	Hello? Yeah, yeah. "Seven days." Cut the crap and wrap it up! You've made a mess out of my school! I'm calling a cleaning service tomorrow and that will come out of your pocket! Enough, sons of the evil! Spawn of Satan! Go to Hell! I'm going to borrow Conan's gun|and shoot you right in the face! 

FRED	We need to get the camera|from the principal's office. 

JACK	Screw the camera! You work here. Are there other exits? 

PROFESSORA HELENA/FRED	There are none!| Let's jump out the window! 

PROFESSORA HELENA/FRED	Bad idea.| Why? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	The last kid who tried playing hooky by jumping out the window|ended up like this. 

FRED	His ass came up to his neck? 

JACK	Are those his testicles|hanging from his chest? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Yes. 

TULIO	You keep pictures of crippled students? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	No, people share them|over the teachers' chat group.  I find it distasteful, too.| I thought it was kind of cool. 

TULIO	The secret is to think|as if we were in a horror movie. 

JACK	Yeah, right. So everyone dies,|except the hot chick. 

FRED	And we don't even have a hot chick. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	That's it! Before they renovated,|there was a door that led outside! 

JACK/FRED	Great!| Where? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	I don't know! I only started|working here after the renovation. 

JACK	Great. Dungeon Master's in the group. She knows there's an exit,|but doesn't know where. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	There's an old floor plan|in a cabinet in the principal's office. It's our best shot! 

FRED	Perfect. And while we're at it,|we grab the camera! 

TULIO	Oh, man, not blood again! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Did Principal NOGUEIRA	just die? 

JACK	No, I think this room|is having its period. 

FRED	Careful! Maybe he did have HIV! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	I sure hope he didn’t. 

FRED	Look. This is real blood. Bloody Mary's spirit is real! She escaped from the bathroom|and now is attacking people! 

JACK	We're going to die,|and you're shooting a video! 

FRED	If we die and people find this,|at least I will be famous. 

JACK	Look for the damn plans! 

JACK/TULIO	Found it!| The floor plans? 

JACK	No, our payment! 

FRED	What? Fair is fair. 

TULIO	Guys! No matter what happens, we simply cannot act like|those morons in horror movies who split up to find out|where the noise came from. That never works!|We got to stick together! Guys? Jackson? Hey. 

FRED	It's the Principal. I found them! I found the floor plans! We are saved! 

NOGUEIRA	You. Yeah, you. Pothead. 

TULIO	Me? 

NOGUIERA	You're going to die before Christmas. 

TULIO	Fred! Help! I'm swallowing HIV here! 

FRED/PROFESSORA HELENA	He's fine!| Is he? 

TULIO	No! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Yeah, he's doing great. 

TULIO	Jackson! Help me! He's going to kill me! Save me, Jackson! Hey! Hey! He's going to kill me! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Do you think we are going to die? 

FRED	Of course not. I'm this team's leader. I'm not|letting anything bad happen to us. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	I can't believe this is happening. 

FRED	Me neither! All I just wanted to have my own TV show! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Fred… 

FRED	Why did we have to find a ghost|who wants to kill us all? Couldn't we just have found Slimer? Or Casper? At least he is a friendly ghost. 

TULIO	Somebody help! Chill out, man. You're being a little rough. No! Go back to Hell, bastard! Go transmit HIV to Satan! 

FRED	You know, when I was a kid, I'd never perform the Bloody Mary ritual. I was too afraid.|I mean, I was just a kid. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	So much has changed since my days. There's so much I don't do anymore. 

FRED	Do you really think we're going to die? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	If this was our last night alive, what would you want to do? Huh? 

JACK	You're Asian, but you're a redhead? That's fucked up.|Where were you born? Hiroshima? You chose the worst time|to come out of the closet. It's late. You're the only student here. 

DANIEL	What are you, stupid?| I'm your biggest fan. I'm Legendary Thanos.|I comment on all of your videos! 

JACK	Legendary Thanos... I hate you. If I'd known that,|I'd have kicked you in the face instead. 

DANIEL/JACK	So what's the plan?| Here's the plan, kid. 

JACK	See? This is the plan. A nice plan right up your ass. The plan is getting out of here! 

DANIEL	And you're going to let|Bloody Mary to haunt the bathroom? 

JACK	She ain't in the bathroom anymore.|She's loose all over the school. 

DANIEL	Then someone has freed her|from the mirror. Who could be that dumb? Anyway, you always have a plan,|don't you? Why don't you make one of your weapons? 

JACK	It's different now, it's something else.|Now Túlio isn't the ghost. Just shut up. 

DANIEL	Who is Túlio? 

JACK	What are you looking for? 

JACK	A way out, because|the main exit is a no-go. 

DANIEL	Mom once told me that the library|was public back in her days, so there must be an exit there! 

JACK	The exit is here. In the library! I knew it! I'm just going to ask you a favor. Once we leave this room, zip it. Keep your mouth shut. Do not fidget. Clearly you do nothing but screw up. Didn't I just tell you to be quiet? We're going to the library,|but we should find a weapon first. 

FRED	Had you ever got fucked|on school grounds? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Harder! 

FRED	So, teacher, Am I approved? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Harder! 

FRED	Enjoying the math table? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Harder! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Go to hell, Fred! 

JACK	Push the locker! 

JACK/DANIEL	Do something, kid!| But what?! 

JACK	Whatever, find a wire coat hanger|and pills of Cytotec! 

DANIEL	Did you see that? The mirror killed the fetus! I'm sure that the mirror|Bloody Mary came out of is the only thing that can hurt her! Like a silver bullet for werewolves,|or garlic for vampires! Gee, man. Was that really necessary? It was already dead. 

JACK	I never want to look at another fetus. 

TULIO	Bloody Mary... She exists... She really does exist. 

CONAN	Do not touch that! The hell's this all about? 

TULIO/CONAN	I'm hungry...| I knew it! 

TULIO/CONAN	Caroline's head exploded... Blood...| I'm going to find out what's going on. 

CONAN	Have you brought a fucking|kid to the school at night? 

TULIO	I don't know anything about no kid! 

CONAN	I'm calling the principal. 

TULIO/CONAN	I'm crapping my pants...| Hello? 

CONAN	Did you cut off the school's phone line? 

TULIO	I'm drenched in blood, and you're worried|about the school's phone line, dude! Bloody Mary is going to kill us all! 

CONAN	Bloody Mary, huh? 

CONAN/TULIO	So she's going to kill us, huh?| Yes! 

CONAN	Shut your trap!|I'm going to deal with this. 

CONAN/TULIO	You just stay here, nice and quiet...| She's going to kill you! 

CONAN	...while I deal with this Bloody Mary. 

TULIO	Let me go! 

CONAN	I'm going to fix this shit. But, first, I got to take care of|some more serious shit. 

TULIO	Hey! Get me out of here! 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	They forgot about us in here. Didn't they ask us|to be part of this joke? 

PROFESSORA RENATA	If this was a horror movie,|we'd be those meaningless side characters. The ones who are just cast|to add some extra deaths and blood. 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	Yeah. But in those movies,|before those characters die, they're either doing drugs or having sex. 

PROFESSORA RENATA	But I didn't bring any drugs. 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	 Or having sex.| Then I think we will survive. 

PROFESSORA RENATA	I will go talk to the principal to see 

PROFESSORA RENATA/PROFESSOR RICARDO	if we can go home now.| Wait. 

JACK	We've come this far.|We will make it. 

FRED	What about Túlio? 

JACK	There's no more Túlio.|And that's your fault. 

FRED	You left him behind! Mrs. Helena had ran off!|I had to protect her. 

FRED/JACK	She was an innocent bystander.| You're lucky I came to save you. 

FRED	Actually, I found you in the hallway! 

JACK	The exit must be somewhere around here. 

DANIEL	It's in the library, like I said. 

JACK	As I said, it's in the library! Just because it has books,|doesn't mean it's a library. 

CONAN	Bloody Mary. Boo! What the fuck is that shit? Not today, mister poop! I need to get out of here. We need to get out of here! 

CONAN/TULIO	We got to leave!| That's what I said when I came in here! 

CONAN	I just fought a poop, man! 

TULIO	I noticed the smell! Dude, why do you keep|a shotgun in a school? 

CONAN	You don't know this school. 

TULIO	Yes, I do! It's a regular school! 

CONAN	You're right, this is incriminating|evidence I'm stashing for my cousin. 

CONAN/TULIO	As for you...| What? 

CONAN	You talk too much! Come on! 

FRED	I hope your friend is right|about the exit being there. 

JACK	He isn't my friend. I hate him. 

FRED/JACK	Why?| He's Legendary Thanos. 

FRED/DANIEL	What?| Yeah. 

JACK/DANIEL	That kid's a jackass.| No, you're the jackasses! 

DANIEL/FRED	I never thought you'd be such wusses!| Listen, kid. 

FRED	I've survived a week in the jungle|drinking my own urine! 

DANIEL	Oh, yeah? And what did you eat? 

FRED	Your ass! 

JACK/FRED	Great | Do you still think I'm a wuss? 

FRED	Don't get near her. She's possessed. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	What happened to me? 

FRED	Don't you remember anything?| Anything at all. Not even about us? 

DANIEL	Everything will be all right now.|Mrs. Helena is here! 

JACK	"Everything will be okay now.|Mrs. Helena is here. Everything will work out." This isn't iCarly, you little shit! 

DANIEL	Don't mind them, Mrs. Helena.|Just a second. Sit down a bit, take deep breaths. 

FRED	So you don't remember anything? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	I don’t. 

FRED	So, what's the plan? 

JACK	What the fuck is that? 

FRED	It's torch slipcase.|Can't you see it's a condom? 

FRED/JACK	Have you never seen one before?|You fucked that trollop? 

FRED	She was possessed, man.|I fucked Bloody Mary! 

FRED/JACK	Bloody Mary?| Yeah! 

JACK	A -year-old girl? That's child molesting! 

DANIEL	She isn't really . She's over , considering she died last century. 

JACK	So she's dead. That's necrophilia! 

FRED	No. Bloody Mary was|in her very alive body. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Where am I? Where do I go? 

FRED	Also, if the kid is ten,|and we add up the teacher's age, I fucked a -year-old, on average. 

DANIEL	So you fucked Mrs. Helena|and Bloody Mary at the same time? 

FRED	 That's right.| Dude. 

DANIEL	Then it was a threesome. 

FRED	Exactly. 

JACK	You shouldn't even be|in this conversation. 

FRED	Yeah. Here, throw this away. 

FRED	What a sissy. 

PROFESSOR RICARDO	So this is it? This is my role in the story? To be cast as a minor character, end up in some dump, and die a grotesque death? You bastards! 

CONAN	Shit! Come on. I'm going to find out what you did. Come on. We're getting out of here. We are getting out of here! 

TULIO	Stop eating Caroline! You cannibal! Stop it, cannibal! You cannibal! 

CONAN	What the fuck? 

CATARINA	Do you want to play with me? 

PROFESSORA HELENA	I'm beginning to remember… 

JACK	See this? The old exit is somewhere on that wall. 

JACK/DANIEL	Let's do this.| Wait a second. 

DANIEL/FRED	The exit is here!| Good job, Thanos! 

JACK	Of course you knew where it was.|You saw it here.

PROFESSORA HELENA	Guys, I felt it... She's just a little girl, upset over bad things|that happened to her… 

JACK	Yeah, she's just a victim, right? Deep down, she's really nice. She was just helping Caroline|clear up her head. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Students are confused.|It is my duty to help them! 

JACK	So you like helping? Then help them push that bookshelf|so we can get out of here! Come on, now. 

FRED	It's blocked. 

FRED	Record this to me. Don't try this at home. 

DANIEL	Are you stupid? Did you really think you could tear|down that wall with a flying kick? There is no way out.|You will have to face Bloody Mary. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Or help her. 

FRED	For a teacher and an Asian kid,|you guys are pretty dumb. Haven't you realized that|we're not paranormal hunters? We can't face ghosts. We're just freeloaders|following the YouTube trend so we don't have to get real jobs. Who told you to film that, kid? Before doing this,|I've tried getting into Big Brother, being a DJ, doing stand-up comedy.|I've even been a pro MMA fighter! 

JACK	No, that's a lie.|You've never been a pro MMA fighter. 

DANIEL	And if you did, Catarina would kick your ass. 

JACK	Catarina? Who's Catarina? 

DANIEL	Bloody Mary's real name. 

JACK	How come you know that? 

DANIEL	Everybody uses "Bloody Mary"|when they summon her, but not me. I performed properly the ritual.|That's why she showed up. 

JACK	You performed "properly" the ritual, huh? Where did you find this? 

TULIO	Wait, man! Stay back! I'm armed! 

UNCLE	And then the ox came|and fell on top of me! How could I escape? Oxen are heavy! So I balled up my|screwdriver like this, I pierced its hide|between its third and fifth ribs, and made my way through him|by ripping out his guts. I went through to the other side! 

FRED	What does it say here? 

JACK	Do you always come here to read|old newspapers and summon ghosts? 

DANIEL	No. Actually, I came to see this. 

FRED/DANIEL	Why don't you look up porn on the net?| Mom's Christian, she's blocked XVideos. 

FRED	This is why you were always going on|about Caroline's boobs in the comments. 

JACK	Shall we try and do something|useful around here?Maybe there's something here|that might help us. 

TULIO	You left me behind to die. 

JACK	What? 

FRED	Wait, Túlio, killing friends|isn't going to solve problems. 

TULIO	Friends? My friends were going for|the exit and leaving me? 

FRED	I'd never leave you behind!|I was going to come back with the police! 

TULIO	And what would the police do?|Handcuff the ghost? Shoot it in the head? Bullets go through|Bloody Mary's body, moron! I saw it with my own eyes! But I think this bullet|can kill me a douchebag. I only have one.|And I'm thinking of using it on you. 

TULIO/JACK	Just to try it out.| Calm down, Túlio. 

JACK	This isn't what you're thinking|We're so close to putting an end to… 

TULIO	By leaving me behind to die, right?|That is it! You have no idea what|I went through to get here. I've had to rip my way through|the guts of a huge ox with my own hands. His shoe size was . Turn that shit down! 

FRED	Dude, we can use what's here|to become rich! It's going to change our lives! 

TULIO	So now I'm good enough|to be on camera, huh? 

JACK	Actually, right now we|want you on our team! Right? 

EVERYONE	Yeah! That's right!| Exactly! 

JACK	Because you're talking|like a real Ghoulbuster. 

EVERYONE	Yeah!| That's right, man. 

TULIO	Will I have my own uniform? 

EVERYONE	Of course!| The nicest uniform! 

TULIO	And I will never have to dress|like a ghost again? 

FRED	No.| No way. That was bad taste. 

JACK	I never agreed to that.|It was Caroline's idea. You're going to be on camera, Túlio. You will have your own uniform|with the Ghoulbusters logo. 

TULIO	Shut up! That name sucks! It sounds like a Ghostbusters|cheap ripoff. And that logo, too! It was drawn|by a one-handed nincompoop. 

JACK	But it was me. 

TULIO	We're going to change it.|It will be the logo I designed and you guys just ignored. 

TULIO/JACK	I have it here with me.| No, no! Dude! 

FRED	Did you stick it up your ass?| There's a kid here! 

FRED/JACK/DANIEL/TULIO	Stop this, please.| Hold on, it's kind of stuck. 

DANIEL	I'm too young for this. 

TULIO	Here it is!|The logo we will be using from now on! Put it on your uniforms. Now! 

JACK	I'm sorry, but is this|a ghost with a club? This logo empowers the ghosts.|We're the ones who should look strong. 

TULIO/JACK	It's better than the shit you drew.| It's like using a chicken in a KFC logo. 

JACK	KFC sells butchered, slaughtered chickens|and there's a happy one on the box. 

JACK/TULIO	It just doesn't make sense.| Put it on! 

TULIO	Paste it on already! 

FRED	I can't make it stick! 

TULIO	Use the blood and pus|oozing from his ear! It's human glue. Glue it on! And I want to be credited as|"Necro-Spectral Sniper CEO”. 

JACK/PROFSSORA HELENA	That position doesn't even exist...| Yes, it does! 

FRED	It does, man.|He fought very hard to get to it. 

TULIO	You know what? On second thought,|I want to be the team's leader. 

FRED	No, you can’t. You can be the weapons guy!|It's way cooler! 

TULIO	Whatever you are,|you've created the coolest logo and an awesome name! 

TULIO	Who's this kid who sounds|like he's in some ad? 

JACK	He's LegendaryThanos. 

TULIO	I hate LegendaryThanos! 

JACK/DANIEL	Me too.| No! 

JACK/DANIEL	Then shoot him.| What the fuck? 

TULIO/JACK	I only have one bullet.| Aim for his head! 

TULIO/DANIEL	Stand still, kid!| Don't do this! 

JACK/DANIEL	Do it!| No! 

TULIO	I can’t. I'm a Ghost Killer.|I don't kill the living, only the dead. 

JACK/FRED	Give me that.| And... cut! 

DANIEL	I get it. You knew he wouldn't|have the guts to shoot me so you used that to take|the shotgun away from him! 

JACK	Yeah, that's right.|I had it planned all along. 

TULIO	Hey! As the new leader,|I say what we will do next! Go back to the bathroom|and perform the ritual backwards. 

JACK	Shut up. We're discussing|serious stuff here. 

JACK/PROFESSORA HELENA	Where's the newspaper?| Here it is. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	"During the  school fair, undertaker José Mojica claims to have talked|to the ghost of a blonde girl through the school bathroom's mirror. The following words|are those of Catarina, the blonde ghost... "I was  years old when I got|transferred to a new school. I was afraid I|wouldn't be accepted. Worried about what other people|would think of me..." Who would like to read?  Catarina.| The Milky Way... "But I never imagined|I'd have such a warm welcome. All the girls wanted to be like me. Those ended up being|the best days of my life. Everything would've|been perfect, if it wasn't for the envy of some girls. School is the most|cruel environment there is for a developing child. I'd never thought my good looks could awake such horrid|feelings in other people.  Catarina...| No, please! The girls said I stole|attention away from them.  Don't mess with us.| Catarina. They said horrible things to me." Catarina! "And humiliated me|as brutally as they could. That's what you get for messing with us! I couldn't handle looking at myself|again after what happened. So I decided to leave. Forever”. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Good God. Such cruelty! 

JACK	I agree. We need to destroy that ghost! 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Stop this! Didn't you hear|what I just read? That girl is a victim|of the society of the living! All she wants is retribution! And that's what we're going to give her! Retribution for… 

JACK	What? From what I've gathered, last time she|threw a fit, she tried to kill you. 

FRED/JACK	She was possessed!| She might be now, too! 

FRED	Her head wasn't spinning! 

JACK	Right. I see how it is.|You're going to defend your girlfriend. 

TULIO	Is she your girlfriend? 

FRED	Of course not! We were stuck together|in an extreme situation, so… 

JACK	I got stuck with that kid, too,|but I didn't think about fucking him. 

FRED	Lost your chance. 

TULIO	So, as the leader,|I will tell you all what to do. We will focus on getting out of here! 

JACK/TULIO	Your plan being?| Perform the ritual… 

FRED	I know! How about|burning the school down? 

FRED/DANIEL	Who could survive fire?| A ghost, maybe? 

JACK	Can't you all just shut up?|Here's what we will do. We will throw the kid outside,|and while Bloody Mary eats him, we hide and wait for the people|who can actually bust ghosts. 

TULIO/DANIEL	Aren't we those people?| Just shut up! 

DANIEL/JACK	I have a plan.| Oh yeah? 

JACK	Let's hear it. 

DANIEL	You want to know what my plan is?|This is the plan! Right in your face! Here's your plan! You don't deserve to wear this. You will never be Ghost Killers! 

TULIO	Unfortunately, I can't shoot|ghosts in the face… Bullets go through|Bloody Mary's body! 

DANIEL	The mirror's the only thing|that can stop her. 

JACK	I have only one bullet.| I can hit anything at any range. 

TULIO	We will show the world|that ghosts have to be hunted. 

JACK	I have a plan! 

JACK/FRED	I will do what I do best.| Play smartass and ruin everything? 

DANIEL/TULIO	Cry like a baby?| Owe my UNCLE rent? 

JACK	No! I will do what Caroline|told us to do from the get-go. 

TULIO/JACK	What?| I will build a weapon. 

TULIO	She didn't say that. 

TULIO/JACK	She talked about being friends...| Shut up! 

JACK	We will need the only|item that can kill Bloody Mary. The mirror she came out of.|I had a shard of it, but I lost it. 

JACK/DANIEL	We must risk our lives to get it.| You mean this shard? 

JACK	Who said you could keep that?|It ain't yours. 

JACK	Got some pliers there? 

TULIO/JACK	The toolbox is in the bathroom.| Then off we go. 

FRED	Hold on. Before we do that,|I will also do what I do best.?People have always said|we faked our ghosts. They've always been real,|but this time, more so! And now it's personal. You can blow as many heads as you want, because we won't give up! 

DANIEL	We are the Ghost Killers! 

JACK	No, you're not. 

FRED	Ghost, we're coming to exterminate you.?

DANIEL	This is so cool! I'm flying! 

FRED	Don't panic! I'm here with you! And I won't leave you behind!|We're more than family! We're a team! We will stick together to the very end! It's the exit! 

JACK	Let's get out of this school! 

TULIO	You can't Leave!|You're in remedial class! 

JACK	Fred, help! Fred! Help! 

FRED	He's going to be fine! 

TULIO	I'm going to kill you and your friend! You will die like a weakling! She's possessing me… Kill him! Kill your friend! She took me over!|Kill me before I kill you! I won't kill him!|I want to see you killing him! 

JACK	Get out of my friend! 

TULIO	Yes!  Shoot!| It's our only chance! I'm possessed, man! Save yourself! One of us has to die! Kill him! Give what's coming to him! Before I kill you! Save yourself, Jackson! I'm doomed!  Shoot!| Kill him! 

JACK	Go ahead and kill me.|I've lost too many friends today. 

TULIO	How cute! You're a hero! 

JACK	Wish I had a cool one-liner|for this situation. Recess is almost over, and I'm the hall inspector|who's going to… 
	No use pushing me around… 

CATARINA	Aren't you tired of getting|your ass kicked by a little girl? 

DANIEL	He got his ass kicked by a fetus, too. 

JACK	Shut up. I call this baby here a nice round of fucking your face! Recess is over, bitch. Eat this... jackass! 

CATARINA	Somebody help me, please! It hurts! 

CATARINA/PROFESSORA HELENA	Please!| I will help you. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	Don't be afraid.|I'm going to help you, dear. I'm here to help. 

DANIEL	The mirror materialized her. 

PROFESSORA HELENA	See what you almost did? You almost destroyed|this poor child's soul. You monster! 

PROFESSORA	Who'd like to read? 

SCHOOL GIRL	The Milky Way is one of the… 

PROFESSORA HELENA	She's a victim! 

CATARINA	Now you will see! 

JACK	Sometimes someone evil is just someone evil. 

FRED	A great leader runs|away from nothing, doesn't leave his people behind and kills those who oppose him! 

JACK	Welcome back to hell, Fred. 

FRED	I couldn't go away without filming this! 

JACK	At least someone will make money|by selling it to Faces of Death! 

TULIO	"Aniratac". "Aniratac". “Aniratac". See? Told you! I was right all along! It was the ritual backwards! This movie should be  minutes long!|We could all be in bed by now! 

JACK	Is that Caroline's uniform? 

TULIO	I couldn't save the world|not wearing a hero outfit. And if we survive,|I will want a male uniform. This one kind of chafes my nads. Not comfortable. 

JACK/FRED	Fine by me.| Agreed. 

TULIO	Jackson! She has to look in the mirror! 

JACK	Get me a crowbar, Túlio! 

TULIO	Here you go! 

FRED/JACK	Do it!| Hold her down! 

JACK	Fred, go! 

DANIEL	That was awesome! We exterminated Bloody Mary! We did it! 

JACK	Told you it was a -grand job. 

DANIEL	Now that I've helped you|and that I'm part of the team, I think we should give|an official statement… 

TULIO	Shut up, kid.|You're not part of the team. "Official statement" my ass. Go away. You're ruining our moment. 

FRED	Folks, we'd like to give|an official statement. The Ghost Killers have exterminated Bloody Mary! 

JACK	Unfortunately, in the process, some teachers and the principal|have lost their lives. 

TULIO	Easy, now. The school's saved, and classes|will be resumed today! 

JACK	Learn this, now that you're going|to be on camera with us. You will never please everyone. 

JACK/TULIO	And take off that awful wig.| I had that on all the time? 

TULIO	You know what? The most important|thing is that we're alive. 

FRED	Yeah, but there is one thing|that will be hard to overcome. 

TULIO	Yeah, Caroline's death. 

FRED	No. Losing our show. The footage. It's all gone. 

TULIO	Maybe not. Look what I got! Before I left, I took the footage|from the school's security cameras. 

FRED	Way to go, Túlio! Now I want to see what TV station|won't buy our show! Eat this, jackass! 

TV HOST	To return Bloody|Mary to the mirror, you just had|to perform the ritual backwards. If I'd seen that in a movie,|I'd have found it ridiculous! Seems to be lazy screenwriting. 

TULIO	If you saw it in Stranger Things,|you'd think it was genius. 

JACK	How about Ultraje a Rigor writing|a theme song for the Ghost Killers? 

ULTRAJE A RIGOR	I'd never work with|someone like you. 

TV HOST	You can't smoke in here! This isn't your show! You piece of shit. 

FRED	Then I took a knife and buried it|in that kid's face! 

JACK	So I took a shotgun,|looked at her in the eyes, and said, "eat this, jackass!” 

TALK SHOT HOST	How rude! How can you|say such an absurd in here? You can't smoke in here.|This is television. 

LUCIANA	Let's give it up for|the heroes who saved this boy! 

HOST	The only thing more haunting|than the ghosts is their acting.</ i> 

NELSON RUBENS	Okay, okay. Fred, from|the Ghost Killers, is seen leaving a party with a hot old lady! 

SERGIO PORTUGAL	So you're ghost hunters.|You fought ghouls. You fought Bloody Mary! For that you're|getting a "hurrah!", a "yeah, yeah", and|a "cluck cluck”. 

ANNOUNCER	Go! 

TULIO	"Ghoul" and "ghost"|mean the same thing! 

GAME SHOW HOST	Wrong answer! Pie in the face! 

UNCLE	See that?|That's my nephew and his friends! Wonderful. They started in that backroom! I gave them full support.|Always helped them. Look at all their success!|And it's all thanks to me! This is great. Thanks for buying here. 

HERMANO HENNING	The Ghost Killers|are under investigation… 

VINCIUS HENRIQUE	For school murders. 

MARCAO DO POVO	That takes the cake! Blaming ghosts for crimes! 

BORIS CASOY	The government has verified|that the footage is fake. 

MARCAO DO POVO	The scourge of society! 

HERMANO HENNING	The case is under investigation. 

BORIS CASOY	The Ghost Killers|will be indicted for homicide. 

UNCLE	Those three have never been here,|and I've disowned my nephew! Good day to you!
