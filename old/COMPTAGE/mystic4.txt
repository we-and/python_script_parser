MITCH	Hexronn are stealing our water.  And, that’s the man, there. Sam Tucker, who’s letting it happen.

AMANDA	Oh Mum.

NATASHA	She really believes she’s got some special connect.

ISSIE	I just don’t understand, how did she get out?

DAN	You’ve been acting really weird.

ISSIE	I see a horse. It’s kind of mystic. Ghostly.

DAN	This Mystic horse helped you find Blaze. Maybe you shouldn’t be afraid of it.

AMANDA	Oh come on. Come on. Why is this not working?

AMANDA	Oh this thing. Oh. Why, can’t Mum just have an electric like everyone else.

ISSIE	Kills the life force of the bean.  Gran’s words.

AMANDA	What’s that you’re reading?

ISSIE	Ah. Spiritual Midwifery. Gran said to read it.

AMANDA	Give it. Right now.

AMANDA	Oh, Mum. Right. Ok. Let there be coffee.

AMANDA	Fine. Good. Right.

ISSIE	You’re not actually…

AMANDA	Yep.

AMANDA	Ah, fine.

ISSIE	Mmm.

AMANDA	I was thinking, about, us, looking at houses.

ISSIE	What? Why?

AMANDA	Yeah, well don’t you want to get a place of our own?

ISSIE	What, so I finally set up my room and you wanna make me move? Again?

AMANDA	Yeah, look, I know, I know, it’s just that your Gran, she likes things a certain way and we don’t always agree on what that looks like.

ISSIE	Is this about the coffee machine?

AMANDA	No.

ISSIE	Is it about Gran using your toothbrush?

AMANDA	Gran uses my toothbrush?

ISSIE	Is it about the composting toilet?

AMANDA	No, it’s about a lot of things really.

ISSIE	So, you just don’t want to live with her anymore?

AMANDA	That, that’s not what I said.

ISSIE	Sounded like it.

AMANDA	Gran’s very, authentic, a very, very calm and respectful person.

MITCH	Murderer!

MITCH	Don’t set foot on this property, you killer.

AMANDA	Mum, what are you doing?

MITCH	It’s his fault, it’s your fault.

SAM	Please stop yelling at me, I was just dropping something off.

MITCH	It’s his water bottling plant, it’s the noise, or it’s maybe the truck fumes, I’ve moved my bees once already and I’ve still lost two hives.

SAM	Well it’s probably Varroa mite.

MITCH	Corporate lies!

AMANDA	Ok, god, Mum, stop it. This is ridiculous. Sam, I am so sorry.

MITCH	I’m not flamin’ sorry.

SAM	So, this, this is for you.

AMANDA	Thanks.

MITCH	What’s that?

AMANDA	Nothing.

MITCH	You don’t tell me that’s nothing.

AMANDA	Go back inside, we’ll talk about it later.

MITCH	Amanda Rose Brown.

AMANDA	Sam has offered me a job which I have accepted, and I am grateful for.

MITCH	What?

AMANDA	It’s a contract.

MITCH	With the Devil.

AMANDA	Stop it.

MITCH	I would never sell-out for a pay check.

AMANDA	Issie. Tell your grandmother that I understand she is an outstanding and virtuous person.

MITCH	Issie, tell your mother she perfectly exemplifies the capitalist regime.

ISSIE	Can I get a lift to the stables?

ISSIE	You ready Blaze?

DAN	Alright, take this slowly.

ISSIE	Dan, I’ve got this.

NATASHA	Of course you do Issie. You’re the Kauri Point under-fives champion.

DAN	Mount with confidence.

DAN	So now, relax your back. Sit up straight. No tension. Close your eyes and imagine you’re floating.

DAN	Issie. You ok?

ISSIE	Yeah. Yeah, I just need some water.

NATASHA	Drama.

DAN	Did you just have a vision?

ISSIE	What?

DAN	Like you totally spaced out.

ISSIE	No. Well, yeah, I mean I just, I don’t know…

NATASHA	What are you, what are you whispering about? What vision?

ISSIE	Honestly, it’s nothing, things are just a little weird right now.

CAROLINE	Why are they weird?

ISSIE	Oh, you know.

STELLA	Not really.

DAN	You should tell them.

ISSIE	Um, yeah. Yeah, alright. Um, there’s this horse. Mystic. He’s like, kind of like a…

DAN	Like a ghost horse.

ISSIE	No, I don’t know. But he shows me things.

CAROLINE	What things?

ISSIE	Um, visions, I guess. I just had one about a beach, I don’t know why.

DAN	That’s how she found Blaze, when she ran off. I was there.

ISSIE	Mystic helped me find her.

STELLA	And, Mystic’s a ghost?

ISSIE	Yes. No. More like a spirit. I don’t know, he just, is. That sounds weird.

CALEB	I think you’re dehydrated.

ISSIE	I’m not dehydrated. And I’m not making this up.

NATASHA	I’ve seen Mystic.

CALEB	You have?

NATASHA	Yeah. He always turns up at the same spot. That beach, the one behind Seagull Rock. Maybe that’s what your vision was of?

ISSIE	You’re serious?

NATASHA	Yeah, I just, I didn’t think anyone would believe me.

STELLA	I don’t believe you.

NATASHA	It’s true, he’s there all the time.

CAROLINE	I’ve seen a ghost horse.

STELLA	Really?

CALEB	Come on.

NATASHA	Issie, we should go there and look for him.

CALEB	Oh ok, you are clearly making this up.

NATASHA	You know Caleb, not everything can be explained by science.

CALEB	Yes it can Natasha, it’s science.

NATASHA	Fine. We’ll prove it.

ISSIE	We will?

CALEB	Oh, absolutely. Please do. Get a picture. Prove this Mystic’s real.

NATASHA	That’s a great idea. Right, Issie?

ISSIE	Yeah, I guess. Okay, great.

NATASHA	Let’s meet at the beach at one.

ISSIE	Ok.

ISSIE	Gran, can you tell Mum I’ll be back in like an hour?

MITCH	You’ll have to tell her yourself. Your Mum’s sold her soul to a cooperate muttonhead, so we’re no longer talking.

ISSIE	Ok.

ISSIE	Something’s come up. Good luck! Natasha. Unbelievable.

ISSIE	You trash bag.

ISSIE	You are here.

ISSIE	Come on, just one picture. I won’t tag you. Ok then.

ISSIE	Yeah, what do you want horse? Ok fine. Fine.

CALEB	Shouldn’t you be at the beach?

NATASHA	I’m going to the airport.

CALEB	Oh. And to think we were on the edge of a paranormal breakthrough.

NATASHA	I told Issie to meet one. But then, oh no I couldn’t make it. Sad emoji.

CALEB	The tides coming in.

NATASHA	So?

CALEB	So, you have to stop her.

NATASHA	I can’t. I’m flying to stupid Queenstown, to see my stupid Mum.

CALEB	You do know how high the tide can get? Issie’ll be trapped on the beach.

NATASHA	Or she’ll fly out on her magic horse.

CALEB	I’m serious.

NATASHA	Look Caleb, it was a stupid joke. All Issie will do is take a big walk, that’s all.

CALEB	But there’s no phone service on that bay. What if she gets in trouble then tries to swim out?

NATASHA	You’re the one who said she should try and get a picture.

CALEB	Ok, no I said you should.

NATASHA	Caleb, she’ll be fine. There are warning signs, like everywhere. What’s she going to do, just ignore them?

ISSIE	Wow. This is lovely. Doesn’t feel like somewhere I might die. Ok, if this is where you want me to go.

CALEB	Issie. Issie.

ISSIE	What was that? Oh, not ok.

CALEB	Issie.

ISSIE	Caleb.

CALEB	We need to go, come on.

ISSIE	Wait, hang on, I.

CALEB	No, like now.

ISSIE	Woah, what is the rush?

CALEB	We gotta hurry. Trust me on this.

CALEB	We need to go faster.

ISSIE	I’m going as fast as I can. Wait, wait, wait, what was that?

CALEB	The tide. The cave is flooding.

ISSIE	Ok, so we swim.

CALEB	Are you crazy? You’ll get sucked out to sea, we’ve got to turn back.

CALEB	That was close.

ISSIE	So, how long are we gonna be stuck out here for?

CALEB	Five hours.

ISSIE	Five hours, are you kidding?

CALEB	I mean, maybe.

ISSIE	Maybe you’re kidding?

CALEB	No, I mean it could be six hours, depends on the moon.

ISSIE	Oh, this is rubbish.

CALEB	Yeah, people get trapped here every summer, tourists usually.

ISSIE	Wait, what are you even doing here?

CALEB	It was a joke, sending you to the beach.

ISSIE	Yeah, I got that.

CALEB	Natasha never saw a magic horse.

ISSIE	Ok, I never said magic horse.

CALEB	Alright, ghost horse, whatever?

ISSIE	And were you all in on it?

CALEB	What? No. Why would you think that?

ISSIE	Caroline said she saw Mystic too.

CALEB	Caroline said she saw Lady Gaga at the Kauri Point flea market.

ISSIE	You told me to get a picture.

CALEB	I didn’t mean, think you’d actually, do it. I mean, you made it up, right?

ISSIE	I didn’t make this up.

CALEB	You can’t expect people to believe that you saw a magic horse.

ISSIE	Well, stop saying that. I never said magic. Mystic’s like a spirit, or something. I don’t know. And do you know what? I know how that sounds, ok, I’m not stupid. I did see him, and I actually thought you’d understand. I trusted you, all of you. I put myself out there by saying something and now I feel like an even bigger looser, an outsider, not that you’d know how that feels.

CALEB	Sorry.

ISSIE	You know what? I’m climbing out of here.

CALEB	Seriously, do you have a death wish? That cliff’s super unstable.

ISSIE	It’s not even that high.

CALEB	You know you can break bones from a three inch-fall with the right velocity.

ISSIE	Okay, well I’ll try and keep my velocity to a miniMum.

CALEB	Just, come on. Please. Don’t.

ISSIE	Whatever chicken-boy. I’ll wave from the top.

CALEB	Do you need a boost?

ISSIE	No, I’m good.

CALEB	I had no idea you were so athletic.

ISSIE	Yeah, comes naturally.

ISSIE	Oh, there’s no reception.

CALEB	It’s the cliffs, I told you, they block the signal.

CALEB	A little help, to get this out.

ISSIE	Do I want rusty bell tetanus? No, I don’t. Thank you.

CALEB	You know rust itself doesn’t actually give you tetanus?

ISSIE	Yeah yeah, whatever.

CALEB	Thank you.

ISSIE	Sure, glad I nearly drowned so I could slowly burn to death here. Oh, it’s hotter than Chris Hemsworth.

CALEB	There’s a massive hole in the ozone layer right above New Zealand.

ISSIE	Oh great.

CALEB	So, we have a really fast burn time.

ISSIE	Oh.

CALEB	We could build a shade shelter, there’s wood down the beach.

ISSIE	What are you, five-years-old? I’m not doing that.

CALEB	Wow, that’s old school, I wonder how it got here?

ISSIE	Who cares, it’s creepy.

CALEB	Aren’t you even kinda curious?

ISSIE	Are you hungry?

CALEB	Yeah. Starving.

ISSIE	It’s Gran’s, home-made bubble slice.

CALEB	Yum.

CALEB	It’s sticking to my mouth like concrete.

ISSIE	Yeah. Gran’s cooking’s a bit hit-and-miss.

CALEB	Hey, are you still mad?

ISSIE	You have amnesty. For saving me from being sucked out to sea.

CALEB	I bet that came from an old ship. There used to be heaps of ships up the West Coast, like way back. Whalers, Sealers, pretty much a superhighway.

CALEB	Are you ok?

ISSIE	Yeah, I just.

CALEB	You should have some water. Could be sun stroke.

ISSIE	No, I, I’m fine. I just, had a vision. From Mystic.

CALEB	Um, now.

ISSIE	Yeah.

CALEB	Ok, yeah, yeah, no, a vision. Yeah, right, let’s talk about that.

ISSIE	There was a storm, and a ship, in trouble, I think, I think it was sinking. Mystic showed me where that was, I think it has something to do with the visions and Blaze.

CALEB	So, what does it mean then?

ISSIE	I don’t know.

ISSIE	Um, I want ice cream.

CALEB	I want, air conditioning.

ISSIE	Um, a fan.

CALEB	Um, breathable clothing. Oh, it’s so hot.

ISSIE	What? You said you were hot.

ISSIE	Hey.

CALEB	I’ve been thinking about what you said, earlier. About trusting us, and not feeling like an outsider and stuff. I do feel like that sometimes.

ISSIE	You don’t need to say that just to make me feel better.

CALEB	I’m not.

ISSIE	Oh come on, this is your home, your friends. I’m just the weird girl that everyone thinks is a liar.

CALEB	I’m weird too.

ISSIE	Come on. Like what’s going on with you? Tell me.

CALEB	I’m. I’m gay. I think. No, I know I am.

ISSIE	Gay? As in T-swizzle’s coming we need to pre-book?

CALEB	Okay, I don’t know what that is, but I’m pretty sure you just stereotyped me.

ISSIE	Oh, I’m sorry, sorry, I’m like foot in mouth girl, not the disease, the other one and I don’t know what to say, I just, say the wrong thing. Can I try again?

ISSIE	Thank you for telling me. It must have been really hard.

CALEB	You can’t tell anyone though.

ISSIE	You haven’t told anyone else? Not even Caroline?

CALEB	I don’t want them to feel weird.

ISSIE	I don’t feel weird. Look, I know this is a big deal, like, huge, but honestly Caleb. No one will even care. Being gay is, I mean, it’s like, one little piece of who you are. A good piece, you know that right?

CALEB	Maybe.

ISSIE	No, not maybe. Definitely. And I promise, I won’t say anything, just, take your time. No pressure.

CALEB	Thanks.

CALEB	Who’s T-swizzle?

ISSIE	We have so much to talk about.

ISSIE	I can’t believe I’m the first person you told.

ISSIE	You know T-Swizzle is Taylor Swift right?

CALEB	Oh, ok.

ISSIE	That is what everybody calls her back home.

CALEB	That makes more sense.

ISSIE	Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ISSIE	I mean, technically it’s a cake, but like biscuit sized. Also, those pineapple things everyone here loves, yeah don’t actually like pineapple.

CALEB	Yes.

ISSIE	So, do you believe me now? About Mystic?

CALEB	I don’t not believe. I just think if you really want to convince people, then you need evidence, did you get a photo?

ISSIE	No.

CALEB	Yeah, so you need a photo or like a recording, or something. You know.

ISSIE	I know how to prove Mystic’s real.

CALEB	Yeah?

ISSIE	Mystic was at the stables, and Tom has security cameras. Right?

CALEB	He keeps it in here somewhere.

CALEB	Reception’s back. Yeah, Mum’s not happy. Is your Mum gonna be worried?

ISSIE	Nah. It’s fine, my Mum and Gran are so busy arguing, they probably won’t even notice I’m still out.

ISSIE	Ah, or not. Gosh, she’s not happy. Mmm. At stables, lost track of the time, be home soon, so lucky my Mum is like my best friend. Smile emoji. Is that too much?

CALEB	Way too much.

ISSIE	Alright, ok.

CALEB	Yes. Got ‘em.

ISSIE	Bingo.

ISSIE	Tom, that is why you’re single.

CALEB	When am I looking for? What date?

ISSIE	Try family fun day.

ISSIE	Clean office, shave legs.

CALEB	No way. Tom would actually kill us if he knew we were here, and that you were eating his hokey pokey. Issie gags. Caleb opens a video file.

CALEB	Ah, I think this might be the fun day.

CALEB	Tom.

ISSIE	Quickly. Copy it.

CALEB	No, we don’t have, we don’t have the time.

ISSIE	Just copy it, just go, quick, oh, Caleb hurry. Hurry Caleb.

CALEB	Ok, it’s in, it’s in.

ISSIE	Am I in trouble?

AMANDA	Huh. This is ground zero.

ISSIE	It was Natasha’s fault. She…

AMANDA	Stop trying to blame other people.

ISSIE	But you’re not listening to me.

MITCH	Oh, we’re listening.

AMANDA	You have no sense of responsibility Issie. Do you have any idea how worried I was? I mean, do you?

ISSIE	Yes, because you’ve told me a bunch of times.

MITCH	I don’t think she does.

AMANDA	Neither do I.

MITCH	And what have you got to say Caleb?

CALEB	I don’t think she does either.

ISSIE	Thanks.

CALEB	Sorry.

ISSIE	And I thought you two weren’t talking to each other?

AMANDA	Of course we’re talking to each other.

MITCH	And you might try the same, starting with “I’m sorry”.

ISSIE	Ok. I’m sorry I’m not perfect.

AMANDA & MITCH	Nobody’s asking you to be perfect missy.

ISSIE	Missy?

AMANDA	Oh, I don’t know, it’s just like it was back home, you know, she doesn’t communicate with me, she doesn’t tell me what she’s thinking. I don’t know what’s going on inside of her head. I mean…

MITCH	Sweetheart. She’s safe.

AMANDA	Yeah, but I mean, what if…

MITCH	She came back. She’s home. Just like you.

AMANDA	Was I this bad?

MITCH	You were a little witch.

ISSIE	Alright Mystic, where are you?

ISSIE	Wait, what the?

ISSIE	It was Natasha. She let Blaze out. Oh, I am so gonna get you.
