CALVIN	I'm not into guys.	
MAURICE	Then why am I here?

DANNI	The man I saw was knocking on divorce.	
ANDI	I know he's getting a divorce.	
DANNI	All I'm saying is, don't get your hopes up, okay?	
ANDI	I am fine.	
GARY	Will you marry me?	
ANDI	Take that ring and leave.	
JASMINE	I'm not gonna go through with the divorce.  That man loves me.  He also gave me this new ring.  (chuckles)	
		
JASMINE	(chuckles)	
ANDI	That's beautiful.	
JASMINE	(chuckles) Thank you.  That's what I thought too.  (chuckles) Uh, it's--it's crazy that I thought that he checked out.	
ANDI	Hmm.	
JASMINE	(chuckles) I'm sorry to have wasted your time.	
ANDI	No.  You--you didn't waste my time.	
JASMINE	Oh, that's kind of you to say that.	
ANDI	I meant it.  (chuckles)	
JASMINE	I'm sure the bill will say otherwise.	
ANDI	(scoffs) I'm sorry.	
JASMINE	No, no.  This is a good day.  (exhales) I know this is disappointing for you.	
ANDI	No, no, not at all.  I'm happy for you.	
JASMINE	Are you married?	
ANDI	No.	
JASMINE	Well, when you get married, and I'm sure that you will, you'll see that once you have invested in building a life with a man, you will take so much shit to try and hold on to what you've built.	
ANDI	I understand.	
JASMINE	Thank you.  Hope I never have to see you again.  No offense.	
ANDI	I get it.	
JASMINE	Yeah.  You have a great day.	
ANDI	You do the same.	
JASMINE	Thanks.

BELLAMY	And you're sure you didn't have anything to do with that?	
ANDI	No, sir.	
BELLAMY	Are you sure?	
ANDI	Sir, I did not persuade her, one way or the other.	
BELLAMY	Well, you should have.	
ANDI	I'm sorry.  Am I missing something?	
BELLAMY	No.  You know what this place is.	
ANDI	Yes.  But I didn't think we were in the business of ending marriages.	
BELLAMY	We're in the business of making money.  So keep that at the front of your mind.	
ANDI	Yes, sir.	
BELLAMY	You know, I've been thinking about your conflict.  And I think that you should take the rest of the day off.	
ANDI	Are you firing me, sir?	
BELLAMY	Andi, I'm protecting you.  You obviously have been crying.	
ANDI	I'm fine.	
BELLAMY	No, you're not.  I have a lot riding on you, and I don't want you to ruin it because of your personal matters.	
ANDI	But, sir, I guess I didn't too much--	
BELLAMY	You don't get it.  You're being watched here daily.

DANNI	That's a yes or no question.	
FREEDA	(laughs)	
DANNI	I'm just looking out for you, okay, because he gave me herpes.	
FREEDA	What?	
DANNI	Yeah, girl.  I'm just, you know, trying to have your back.	
FREEDA	(scoffs) You know, I don't need to do anything, because I'm not sleeping with him.	
DANNI	Okay.  All right.  I'm just warning you, looking out for you, man.	
FREEDA	(scoffs) I'm not doing anything with him, okay, because he knows my uncle.	
DANNI	Your uncle?	
FREEDA	Yes.  My uncle is a pastor.  And he runs a homeless shelter for men, and he goes there at night.	
DANNI	A shelter?	
FREEDA	Yes.  And I volunteer there on the weeknights.  And I recognized him from here.  And I told him he has nothing to be ashamed of.  So, I gave him dinner.  That is all.  I'm really sorry about your situation.	
DANNI	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, he's really just staying at a shelter?	
FREEDA	Yeah.  And don't tell anybody.  I'm sorry.  Listen, can I pray for you?	
DANNI	A--a prayer?	
FREEDA	Yeah.  I know it's not something that you see at work often.  But I would really like to pray for you.	
DANNI	Yeah.  Don't be spitting on me.  I'm good.	
FREEDA	If you say so.	
		
MAURICE	So, you're going to avoid me all day, huh?	
SABRINA	I have a customer.  Sir, sir, have a nice day, sir!	
MAURICE	Come on.  Are you mad that I went out to coffee with him?	
SABRINA	I'm happy if he's into you.	
MAURICE	Are you really?	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.	
MAURICE	You're so full of shit.	
SABRINA	I am.	
MAURICE	Okay.  Then ask me how the date went.	
SABRINA	Well…	
MAURICE	See?  You can't even ask me.  If it was any other man, you would ask.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Go ahead.  How was it?	
MAURICE	Well, we went for coffee.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.	
MAURICE	And he was sitting there looking all good and smelling all good.  And I was--was sitting there, looking all good and smelling all good.  And I sat perched with my legs crossed.  It was so perfect.	
SABRINA	(clears throat)	
MAURICE	Toes pointed down one leg, extravaganza in full effect.  (laughs) You--you listening to me?	
SABRINA	Yeah.  Go on, go on.	
MAURICE	Then look at me.	
SABRINA	Go on.	
MAURICE	Then he wrecked me, girl.  (indistinct) just flirting, batting my eyelashes, and all he could say was, "Can you hook me up with your friend?"	
SABRINA	What?  What friend?	
MAURICE	You, bitch!  (sighs)	
SABRINA	Me?	
MAURICE	Girl, the whole coffee and conversation was about you.	
SABRINA	What?	
MAURICE	Yeah.  You are such a judgmental little whore.  (scoffs)	
SABRINA	How can you say that?	
MAURICE	Judging that man and not wanting to go out with him because you thought he was gay.	
SABRINA	Are you sure?	
MAURICE	Yes.	
SABRINA	Well, then, why is he so comfortable around gay people?	
MAURICE	Oh, Sabrina.  That is so homophobic.	
SABRINA	Oh, bitch, please.  You started it.	
MAURICE	Well, how did I start it?	
SABRINA	You're the one that told me he couldn't be straight if he was that friendly.	
MAURICE	Yeah.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.	
MAURICE	Okay.  I was wrong.	
SABRINA	Exactly.  Thank you.	
MAURICE	We're both wrong actually.	
SABRINA	(sighs) All right.  All right.  We are.	
MAURICE	Well, he has two gay fathers, and he's been around gay people all his life.	
SABRINA	Really?	
MAURICE	Yes.  He's straight, and he likes you, and I like him for you.  He's a good man, Savannah--Sabrina, whatever your damn name is, a good man.	
SABRINA	Really?	
MAURICE	Yes.  You didn't blow it.  But if you don't call him soon…	
SABRINA	Okay.  Okay.  I'll call him.	
MAURICE	Now.	
SABRINA	No.	
MAURICE	Now.	
SABRINA	Now?	
MAURICE	Yes.	
SABRINA	What if I'll just text him?

KAREN	Oh, my God.	
AARON	I told you.	
KAREN	What are you doing?	
AARON	I know a little bit about this.	
KAREN	And where did you learn?	
AARON	Thailand.	
KAREN	Thailand?	
AARON	Yeah, I was stationed there for a bit.	
KAREN	Stationed?	
AARON	Marine Corps.	
KAREN	Oh, typical.  Oh, my God.  That feels so good.  Hope nobody sees.  (laughs)	
AARON	No, I think we're good.  So what did you mean by typical?	
KAREN	Oh, come on.  Look at you.	
AARON	I don't get it.	
KAREN	You're built like a Greek God.	
AARON	(chuckles) Well, thank you.  Do you want me to stop?	
KAREN	No, no, please just go.	
AARON	Okay.  Then you order.	
KAREN	Okay.  Do you like steak?	
AARON	Yeah, that's fine.	
KAREN	Okay.	
AARON	Thank you.	
KAREN	Can we have two steaks, please?  Thank you.	
SABRINA	Hi.	
CALVIN	(chuckles) Wow.	
SABRINA	What?	
CALVIN	You look beautiful.	
SABRINA	Thank you.  Come on in.	
CALVIN	Thank you.  I brought wine.	
SABRINA	Oh.  This is my favorite.	
CALVIN	I know.	
SABRINA	Maurice?	
CALVIN	Yup.	
SABRINA	How much did he tell you about me?	
CALVIN	A lot actually.	
SABRINA	Oh, I'm gonna kill him.	
CALVIN	Oh, don't do that because I wouldn't be here without him.	
SABRINA	I'm sorry I judged you.	
CALVIN	That's cool.  I get it.	
SABRINA	Well, I really like how open-minded you are.	
CALVIN	Thank you.  I don't think my fathers would have it any other way.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.  So what was that like growing up with two dads?	
CALVIN	Hmm, pretty normal actually.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.	
CALVIN	It was only an issue for the people with small minds.	
SABRINA	I'm sure.  (laughs)	
CALVIN	Yeah.  Um, you got an opener?	
SABRINA	Oh, yeah.  Here.	
CALVIN	Cool.  Cool.  Shall I pour?	
SABRINA	Oh, yes.	
CALVIN	Damn girl, something smell good.  What you cooking?	
SABRINA	Italian.	
CALVIN	Oh, my God.  You read my mind.  Oh.	
SABRINA	Do you wanna taste?	
CALVIN	Please.  Hmm.	
SABRINA	Is it good, really?	
CALVIN	So good.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Oh.  Oh, sorry it's hot, um…	
CALVIN	It's cool, um, yeah.	
SABRINA	Dinner's gonna be ready in a minute.  If you want to, you can have a seat.	
CALVIN	Okay.  I'll just pour it for you.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.  Thanks.	
CALVIN	No problem.  Oh, snap.  Don't tell me you like the classics.  Albums, really?	
SABRINA	Uh, yes, I like a little vintage.	
CALVIN	Oh, snap.  Hey, you mind if I play something?	
SABRINA	Go ahead.	
CALVIN	Okay.	
SABRINA	Just make it good.  I'm judging you.	
CALVIN	Oh, okay.  I got you.  Oh, I love this album.  Oh.  Oh, I love jazz.  Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	Okay.  Are you hungry?	
CALVIN	Starving.	
KAREN	What do you do for a living?	
AARON	Several things.	
KAREN	Okay.  Well, the last guy that told me that was a drug dealer, so…	
AARON	You really have had some issues with men, huh?	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.  I got stories.	
AARON	All bad?	
KAREN	All not great.	
AARON	Okay.  Well, here's to creating some new stories and great ones.	
KAREN	Okay.  But, uh, what about you and women stories?	
AARON	Well, I told a friend of mine that I met you and he went nuts.	
KAREN	Why?	
AARON	Well, he knows how I am.  I hate dating.  I'm just more of a commitment guy.	
KAREN	Well, you're married, so that makes sense.	
AARON	Well, I'm actually looking for a really great attorney to file this divorce.	
KAREN	I've heard that before.  (clears throat)	
AARON	No, I'm serious.  Like, do you know anybody?	
KAREN	I do know a great attorney.  She's a good friend of mine.	
AARON	Yeah?	
KAREN	Uh-hmm.	
AARON	Well, please, can I have her number?	
KAREN	I'll text it to you.	
AARON	Thank you.	
KAREN	I'll text it to you, yeah.	
AARON	Yes, please, please do that.  I want that.	
KAREN	So, um, she cheated?	
AARON	Yeah.	
KAREN	How many times?	
AARON	What?  One.	
KAREN	And you're going to divorce her?	
AARON	Like, one time is a deal breaker.  Listen, I'm an honest man, I would not allow anyone to do that, ever.	
KAREN	Wow.	
AARON	What?	
KAREN	How many years were you married again?	
AARON	Fifteen.	
KAREN	And just like that?	
AARON	"Just like that" what?	
KAREN	I mean, no love for her?	
AARON	I will always love her.  I just love me as well and I just won't allow that and, like, she knew that was a real deal breaker for me.	
KAREN	Wow.  I mean, I wish I could just turn it off like that.	
AARON	Well, it isn't easy.  I just--I know what I have to do for me.	
KAREN	What's best for you?	
AARON	And to do what's best for you.  This is really an awesome night.	
KAREN	It really was.	
AARON	Thank you for coming.	
KAREN	Thank you for inviting me.	
AARON	It's my pleasure.	
KAREN	Oh, okay.  I mean, the food was great.	
AARON	Check, please.	
KAREN	It was great, atmosphere was great.  It's beautiful.	
AARON	Thanks.  Damn.	
KAREN	What?	
AARON	I don't have my wallet.	
KAREN	I'll get it.	
AARON	Listen, you will not get it, okay?  Because I'm sure you got a story about some dude that stiffed you on the bill, okay?	
KAREN	I will gladly pay the bill.	
AARON	I won't let you, okay?  I'll--I'll call my wife.  She'll bring my credit card.  Okay?	
KAREN	Your wife?	
AARON	Yes.  Does that bother you?	
KAREN	I mean, she cheated on you, does it--does it bother you to call her?	
AARON	Well, Karen, I don't hate her, right?  I'm just done.	
KAREN	Okay.  But I can just pay the bill.	
AARON	No, look.  We stay around the corner.  I'll just call her.  It's fine.	
KAREN	Okay.  Well then, I will just leave because I'm…	
AARON	No, no, no, no, no.	
KAREN	Just let me pay the bill then.	
AARON	Karen, I want you to know I'm not full of shit, okay?  Just--I'm at Ransom, around the corner.  Can you bring my wallet, please?  We'll be fine.
