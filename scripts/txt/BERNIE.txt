KEVIN	Hey, buddy.

HOLLY	Hi.

BOB	Oh, no.

HOLLY	He's a cutie!

BOB	It can't be.

BOB	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

BOB	The answer is no. N-O. No way, no how...

BOB	unacceptable.

MASON JACKS	Mr. Ryan...

MASON JACKS	you should have received a letter from the court weeks ago. My hands are cuffed.

MASON JACKS	No pun intended.

BOB	Oh. Nice. Sense of humor.

BOB	Let me tell you something, officer.

BOB	I have never received any official notification from the court...

BOB	so I will thank you kindly to take this dolphin-hating...

BOB	criminal...

BOB	and get him out of my office.

MASON JACKS 	Well, it seems you haven't checked your mail in a while.

BOB	Oh, really? I'll have you know that I...

BOB	run a tight ship around here.

BOB	Want to see?

BOB	Electric bill. Water bill.

BOB	Three-for-one pizza.

BOB	Uh...

BOB	Here's a birthday card for Betty.

BOB	County court. A sale...Oh.

BOB	County court.

MASON JACKS	Sorry, Mr. Ryan.

MASON JACKS	I promise he'll be monitored 24/7.

MASON JACKS	And his ankle bracelet lets me know where he is at all times.

WINSTON	Look, Bob, uh, I am sorry for what happened. Never...

WINSTON	meant to hurt you or your kids.

WINSTON	I jus...I just want a second chance.

WINSTON	You know, make up for my past and, uh...

WINSTON	help out with these beautiful dolphins.

BOB	Mm-hmm.

KEVIN	So where'd he come from?

SIDNEY	He was born at a habitat like Marineland.

SIDNEY	Seems he has a history of not adapting...

SIDNEY	well socially...

SIDNEY	like some humans I know.

HOLLY	Come here, little buddy.

KEVIN	H...He's quick. What's his name?

SIDNEY	Um...

SIDNEY	isn't listed in our paperwork. I'll make a call to find out.

KEVIN	Well, since this is a fresh start for him,

KEVIN	how 'bout a new name to match?

HOLLY	With that feisty attitude...

HOLLY	I vote...Rascal.

SIDNEY	Pretty good observation.

SIDNEY	Kevin?

KEVIN	Rascal, welcome to Marineland.

HOLLY	We have to go tell Dad...

HOLLY	his new name! Come on!

BOB	I tell you what, Mills. You mess with my kids...

BOB	SIDNEY, or any of these dolphins...

BOB	and you are so gonna answer to me.

WINSTON	Bob, I am just here to help.

KEVIN	Dad, you missed it! 

HOLLY	Yeah! We have a new dolphin! His name is...

WINSTON	Hey, kids.

KEVIN	No way! 

HOLLY	Oh, no. It's him. [Screaming]

WINSTON	I think she missed me.

BOB	Mm.

BOB	Thanks.

ABBY	So how'd he get out?

BOB	Beats me. But I tell you what. I'm gonna find out.

ABBY 	Well, Holly's certainly not happy about it.

BOB	Yeah, well, that makes two of us. Burgers ready, kids!

ABBY 	Ah.Guess I'll take mine well-done.

KEVIN	Looks like they're ready, Dad.

BOB	Come on. Let's eat.

BOB	Mmm! That is not a bad burger. Hmm?

KEVIN	I mean, yeah, it's crunchy and...chewy. 

ABBY	Holly...

ABBY	something on your mind?

HOLLY	I don't like the idea of having Winston Mills around Marineland.

BOB	Sweetheart...

BOB	don't you worry. Your dad is Head of Marketing, and I am gonna be there every day to make sure Mr. Mills behaves himself.

HOLLY	Well, he better not mess with my dolphins, or I'll show him who's boss.

BOB	Yeah, really.

ABBY	Hey, hey…

ABBY	hey. Listen. We are a family that forgives others, not punches them out.

BOB	Right. Right.

ABBY	So what about this new dolphin, huh? I hear he's a real rascal.

KEVIN	Yeah, yeah, he's cool. Oh, and he's fast, too...

KEVIN	nearly as fast as Bernie.

HOLLY	No way. Nobody's faster than Bernie.

BOB	Hey, Kev...

BOB	what about the new footage? Did you upload it yet? 

KEVIN	Yes, sir. Yep. Posted it...

KEVIN	already. Calling it "Bernie's Return." Yeah, it's...Uh, SIDNEY just texted.

KEVIN	She says she wants more footage...

KEVIN	for the Marineland podcast.

ABBY	You know, tell you what, you know? Um, stop by the shop tomorrow, and we'll take the Ryan Express 2.0 out on my lunch break.

KEVIN	Sweet.

ABBY	Um, can I come?

ABBY	Well, what about Marineland...

ABBY	miss junior dolphin trainer, huh? I thought you had a real rascal to take care of.

BOB	Oh. 

BOB	Mm, well...

BOB	might have two rascals to wrangle tomorrow.

BOB	Hmm?

HOLLY	But you know what? We can do it, 'cause we're rough, we're tough, we're the Ryans.

BOB	That's right. You know what? Would you mind tossing the football with your old man after dinner to make him feel better?

HOLLY	Okay. I'll just grab it.


BOB	Nice.

KEVIN	Hey, Dad, uh...the junior high football coach talked to me last week.

BOB	W-Wait. Wait. Wait.

BOB	You're talking about Coach...Coach Watson?

KEVIN	Uh-huh. Yeah. 

BOB	He spoke to you? You spoke to him? What happened?

KEVIN	He...

KEVIN	He said I'm fast and I might be talented and, uh, I could play receiver like you.

BOB	Oh, really?

KEVIN	Yeah, yeah, and…

KEVIN	I was just thinking just maybe, you know, I could try out for the team next summer.

BOB	Well, as you know, your mother and I would never...


BOB	influence your decision, but should you choose...

BOB	to uh, you know, try out for the team, then I think that we should practice every morning, before and after school...

ABBY	You know what? How 'bout this...

BOB	I have some gear...

BOB	in the garage, right.

KEVIN	Yeah. 

ABBY	Okay, yes, and we'llwe'll talk about all this later. Yeah?

KEVIN	Okay.

HOLLY	The reason Kevin's interested in 

football...

HOLLY	is 'cause he has a crush on a cheerleader.

ABBY	Well, I should have known, yeah? Those...

ABBY	Ryan men.

KEVIN	You go, Bernie. Bernie's back in St. Augustine, everyone.

KEVIN	Yeah, look at him. Hey.

KEVIN	Welcome back home, buddy.

KEVIN	Hi. You guys can check out more updates on "Bernie's Journey." You guys can follow us on the official Marineland Web page.

WINSTON	No, I-I didn't do anything. I came, and th-they screamed.

WINSTON	Then I screamed, and it was just...

WINSTON	I...

WINSTON	I didn't do anything.

WINSTON	Hey!
 
HOLLY	Good one, Rascal.

WINSTON	It's not funny. It's not funny.

KEVIN	Better keep a close eye on him.

HOLLY	Yeah. Why is he really here?

KEVIN	Exactly.

BOB	What are you two whispering about?

HOLLY	Nothing, Dad. All good.

BOB	Oh, yeah, as usual, right?

HOLLY	Mm-hmm.

SIDNEY	Hey, Tommy. Any progress?

TOMMY	Nah.

TOMMY	Tried everything, but he won't budge.

TOMMY	Haven't met a dolphin that didn't like sushi.

SIDNEY	 All right. Um, go give Shannon a hand with Hemingway, and I'll see what we could do with him.

TOMMY	Good luck.

TOMMY	Sure got the name right.

TOMMY	He is a rascal.

SIDNEY	Okay, Holly, let's get to work. It'll keep your mind off Winston...

SIDNEY	helping our buddy here.

HOLLY	Good job, Sunny.

HOLLY	A-plus. Bravo.

HOLLY	Yummy, yummy.

HOLLY	You see that, Rascal?

SIDNEY	Huh.

SIDNEY	That didn't go as planned.

BOB	Holly. SIDNEY. This is Winston Mills, as you know.

BOB	He is our new handyman...

BOB	which means...

BOB	it will be his job to clean up absolutely everything…

BOB	in this habitat.

BOB	Treat everyone with respect, Winston, because I am authorizing the staff, which means you two...

BOB	to assign work duties...

BOB	to Mr. Mills should I not be around. 

HOLLY	Yes.

BOB	Any questions? 

SIDNEY	No.

BOB	Holly, do you have anything you'd like to say?

HOLLY	Welcome to the team, Winston.

WINSTON	Yeah.

BOB	This way to the...

BOB	toilets, Winston.

KEVIN	We're almost there, Mom.

KEVIN	They're heading right towards us.

ABBY	Huh. Do you hear that?

KEVIN	Yeah, wh-what's wrong?

ABBY	I'm not sure. Let's see.

KEVIN	Look who it is. Hey, guys. What's going on? It's good to be back home, huh?

KEVIN	Hey, Bernie. What's up, buddy?

KEVIN	Say hello to the world.

ABBY	Hey, listen. I better get us back. It sounds like the fuel pump's going out.

KEVIN	Okay. Hey, nice job today, Bernie.

KEVIN	All right, we'll get some more close-ups next time. All right, buddy.

WINSTON	h. Finally, it's quitting time.

HOLLY	Psssst.

HOLLY	Get Winston, please.

WINSTON	You little monster! What do you think you're doing?!

HOLLY	Oh. Looks like you missed a spot.

HOLLY	Saw that.

HOLLY	This is gonna be a great summer after all.

WINSTON	How could she possibly have seen that?

DEVON	Nice ride.

DEVON	That an eight-cylinder?

WINSTON	What are you doing here?

DEVON	Just an old friend catching up.

WINSTON	Look, get out of here. I mean, if anyone sees us together, I'm back in the slammer.

DEVON	Who do you think got you out?

WINSTON	Oh, man.

DEVON	Get in.

WINSTON	No way. No way. I mean, that's a crazy idea.

DEVON	I'm afraid you have no choice, pal. I got you out. I can have you put back in.

WINSTON	I-I just wanna do my time here and be released for good, okay?

DEVON	Well, it's not that simple.

DEVON	When you and Brock Winters messed up that power-plant deal, I owe a lot of people money now, and...

DEVON	you, you owe me a lot of money.

WINSTON	Boy, prison's looking better and better.

WINSTON	All right, so how did you get me out?

DEVON	Lucky for you, I still...

DEVON	have powerful people that owe me some favors, so...

WINSTON	What about Brock?

DEVON	No dice. Too tough to get a former mayor out. Oh, he's gonna do his two years for stealing...

DEVON	those turtle eggs.

WINSTON	T-Two years?! They stuck this guy with five!

DEVON	FiI lost...

DEVON	everything, too, you know, everything! I lost my money, my wife, my mansion! I've been living in a flea-bit hotel for the last six months! And it's all those...It's all those kids' fault and that dolphin.

DEVON	This is our opportunity to get revenge.

WINSTON	All right, no, no, look. I-I'm not interested. I'll take my chances.

DEVON	Too late. There's already a deal in place for that...sunburnt dolphin. I'll give you a cut. $100,000…

DEVON	all yours.

DEVON	Here.

DEVON	It's unlisted, so they can't track it, all right? Call me when you, uh...want to upgrade your wardrobe.

WINSTON	I like my wardrobe.

HOLLY	Figures. I knew I was right all along.

HOLLY	See?

HOLLY	Caught him red-handed.

KEVIN	Yeah, but who's that other guy?

HOLLY	I don't know...

HOLLY	but I've got a feeling they were up to no good.

KEVIN	He does look familiar. Um, I'll cross-reference articles of Winston Mills and Brock Winters.

KEVIN	Ya-bam! That's him!

HOLLY	Who's him?!

KEVIN	Uh, DEVON Cruz. Right here.

KEVIN	"Financier DEVON Cruz was named as the mastermind "behind the...

KEVIN	illegal chemical plant scheme "that sent local mayor Brock Winters and real estate...

KEVIN	mogul Winston Mills to prison terms."

HOLLY	Wow. There are too many bad guys go keep up with these days.

KEVIN	Yeah...

KEVIN	it looks like the prosecution didn't have enough hard evidence to put Cruz on trial.

HOLLY	We should probably go tell Mom and Dad.

KEVIN	No, no, no, not yet. Look, we don't have anything that...

KEVIN	proves they've done anything illegal. We'll just, I guess, sit back, um...keep an eye on Winston. I mean, knowing him, he'll mess up soon, anyways, right?

HOLLY	Yeah, he's pretty awesome at that.

KEVIN	Yep.

HOLLY	or a sea turtle?

WINSTON	Well, I'm guessing they don't use 'em for milkshakes, right?

HOLLY	Winston, you sure have a lot to learn. Plastics alone harm more than...

HOLLY	100 million marine animals each year!

KEVIN	It's my GPS tracking alert.

KEVIN	Bernie's near Devil's Island. TheThe pod never goes there.

HOLLY	What?

KEVIN	He's just...

KEVIN	swimming around in circles.

HOLLY	What if he's in trouble?! We better go check on them.

KEVIN	Yeah, something's up. Let's go.

BOB	No, no. Wait a minute, kids. I'm going with you.

BOB	Uh, Winston, finish up here, and then check in with SIDNEY. I'm gonna be back. Come on.

HARPER	I am so hungry.

HARPER	Nothing. Not one bar.

HARPER	I could try to swim to shore.

ELLIE	You got cut from the swim team.

HARPER 	Yeah, so? At least I'm not a pompom girl.

ELLIE	Oh ho, okay. How original. Just had to play the cheerleader card, huh?

HARPER 	Yep, it's a no-brainer.

HARPER	And we're out of water, too. Great.

ELLIE	Just keep saying your prayers. I mean, they've gotta be looking for us by now.

HARPER 	Yeah, and my parents are gonna ground me 'til I'm 80.

ELLIE	Uh-oh.

HARPER	Sharks. Just what we needed.

ELLIE	They're not sharks. They're dolphins.

HARPER 	Oh, my God. Hey, look.

HARPER	That one has a pink spot.

ELLIE	That's Kevin and Holly's friend, Bernie the dolphin.

HARPER 	He's kinda cute.

ELLIE	Yeah, they're smart...

ELLIE	too. Maybe they can help us.

HARPER 	Seriously?

HARPER	What, are we gonna ride them home?

ELLIE	Have a little faith, will you? Mrs. Ryan said that Kevin can track them.


ELLIE	Bernie...we need a huge favor.

WINSTON	Crappy day for you, too, huh?

WINSTON	What do you want?

WINSTON	Are you, uh...you hungry? Huh?

WINSTON	Well, what do you know? 

WINSTON	Pretty tasty, huh? Oh, I prefer steak...

WINSTON	over sushi, but to each, their own, right?

WINSTON	Little fishy.

KEVIN	Faster, Dad. The pod's about a mile away.

BOB	You got it, Kev.

KEVIN	We got 'em. Here they come.

HOLLY	Drop the hammer, Dad. Bernie needs us.

ELLIE	Harper, it's a boat. Harper, it's a boat! Hey! Over here!

HARPER	Hey! Over here!

SUMMER	In an amazing feat, Bob, Holly, and Kevin Ryan found the girls with the help of...ho else? Bernie the dolphin. Kids, tell us how you did it.

KEVIN	Well, Ms. Sands, I just used my GPS tracking device to locate Bernie and the pod.

HOLLY	And they led us right to ELLIE and Harper.

SUMMER	Amazing. This unique dolphin and his family...

SUMMER	just keep surprising us all. Girls...

SUMMER	would you like to say anything?

ELLIE	We just wanna thank the Ryans.

HARPER 	Oh, and a special thanks to Bernie and his family.

HOLLY	Yeah. 

HOLLY	Go, Bernie!

SUMMER 	Go, Bernie, indeed. I'm Summer Sands reporting. Back to you, Peter.

ABBY	how's it feel to be local heroes...again?

HOLLY	Pretty sweet, Mom.

HOLLY	That's the second interview this week.

BOB	I'm just happy we were able to find them. Well, actually Bernie found 'em, but we helped.

ABBY	Well, I'm proud of all of you. Where's Kev?

HOLLY	Prowling around the garage.

ABBY	I see. 

ABBY	So how's the dolphin training going?

HOLLY	Rascal's still being a rascal.

BOB	Mm-hmm.

HOLLY	SIDNEY said...

HOLLY	it's just taking him time to adjust to his new environment.

ABBY	And what about...

ABBY	 the other rascal? Hmm? How's Winston behaving?

BOB	Ah, he's keeping to himself, doing his job like a good little criminal.

ABBY	Holly, you being nice to him?

HOLLY	Trying.

ABBY	Do better than...

ABBY	try. Maybe this opportunity will help turn him around.

BOB	Oh, come on, honey. Let's not go overboard, huh?

KEVIN 	Hey, Dad, found your gear. Can we play?

BOB	You bet.

HOLLY	Football? Now I get it! You really do have a crush on Ellie!

KEVIN	No, I don't!

DEVON	Looks like there's more than one cockroach in…

DEVON	this place.

WINSTON 	What are you doing here?

DEVON	Landlord's an old friend. I used to own this place.

DEVON	People used to respect me back then, you know?

DEVON	They'd call me Mr. Cruz.

DEVON	They'd say, "Hi, Mr. Cruz.

DEVON	"Hello, Mr. DEVON Cruz.

DEVON	"Good morning, Mr. Cruz.

DEVON	Hi, Mr. DEVON Cruz. There he goes."

WINSTON	Are you Are you okay, Devon?

DEVON	I want it.

WINSTON 	You You want me to steal from a kid?

DEVON	You've done worse.

DEVON	100,000...

DEVON	in cold, hard cash should clear a bad conscience.

WINSTON 	I'm just trying to stay clean and stay out of trouble, okay, and, besides, there's a new dolphin at Marineland, and he even likes me.

DEVON	Oh. Winston's finally found a new friend. That is so sweet.

WINSTON 	Yeah.

DEVON	You owe…

DEVON	me, Mills. You mess this up...I'll make sure you wear this for a long...long time.

DEVON	Looks like you need a new...

DEVON	nest. I think I can pull some 

strings.

DEVON	Just get me that device.

DEVON	I'll be in touch.

SIDNEY 	Let's try some enrichment devices.

SIDNEY	We'll show Rascal how the other dolphins play with them.

HOLLY 	Okay.

HOLLY	Go and get it, guys.

SIDNEY	Uh…

SIDNEY	I don't know where else he…

SIDNEY	would go.

HOLLY 	Don't worry. We'll help him…

HOLLY	no matter what it takes.

BOB	This is so far out of bounds, it's not even funny. The answer is no.

MASON 	But it's a court order, Mr. Ryan, signed by the judge.

BOB	You're telling me that you think it's a good idea for Winston to stay here?

BOB	I mean, this is not exactly...

BOB	a bed-and-breakfast, officer.

MASON 	It's just until his apartment is fumigated. There's a bug problem.

BOB	Ah, and we get stuck with the biggest roach of all.

MASON 	Look, you said he's been on good behavior. 

MASON	If he tries…

MASON	anything funny, I'll be here in a hot minute.

MASON	Surely you've…

MASON	someplace he can sleep.

BOB	Shark tank.

WINSTON 	So I've never been down here before.

BOB	Well, that's because it's for authorized personnel only. Don't make me regret this, okay? Got a cot here, and then you can shower upstairs in the changing room.

WIINSTON 	Penthouse suite, huh?

BOB	That's right. And, look, we got a lot of...

BOB	nice equipment down here, so, uh, just don't...

BOB	mess with anything, okay?

WINSTON 	Whoa. What was that?

BOB	Hmm. It's your new roommate.

WINSTON 	New…

WINSTON	roommate. Everyone's a comedian.

WINSTON	Ow! That's gonna be fun. Ouch.

HOLLY 	Mango, say, "Hi." Say, "Hi." Say, "Hello. Say, "Hello."

HOLLY 	Who's a pretty boy? Here you go.

HOLLY	Aww. Who's a pretty boy?

HOLLY	Isn't he so cool? 

MANGO 	Hey, pretty boy.

HOLLY	Oh…

HOLLY	this is Mango.He's super-duper cool.

BOB	Hmm. Mango, huh?

MANGO 	Mango, pretty boy.

BOB	And there is a…

BOB	reason why there's a parrot in my office?

KEVIN 	Yeah, he's Tommy, the trainer's, pet bird.

HOLLY 	And Tommy's moving apartments, so…

HOLLY	can we keep him here? Can we?! Can we?! 

HOLLY	Please?!

KEVIN 	Yeah, it's just gonna be for a couple days.

MANGO 	Mango!

BOB	Is there a volunteer to feed and clean up after Mango?

HOLLY 	Oh, oh, oh. I will! I volunteer! I love Mango!

MANGO 	I love Mango. 

BOB	Well, looks like we have two new residents, kids. Mr. Mills here is staying down in the maintenance…

BOB	room while his apartment is…

BOB	being fumigated.

KEVIN 	What?

KEVIN	No way, Dad. No.

HOLLY 	Yeah! He's a bad guy.

MANGO 	Bad guy.

BOB	There's nothing we can do about it. It's a court order.

BOB	Okay...

BOB	that's enough. Come on. Let's get back to work.

BOB	Winston, uh…grab your cleaning supplies, and meet the kids out by the, uh, shark tank, will you?

WINSTON 	Okay, sure. I'll uh...

WINSTON	I'll be right there.

MANGO 	Winston…

MANGO	bad guy.

MANGO 	Bad guy.

HOLLY 	Wow! That's so cool!

WINSTON 	Yeah, well, that's, uh...

WINSTON	suicide, if you ask me. Those things give me the creeps.

WINSTON 	What is that?

KEVIN 	Bernie's Journey. You wouldn't like it.It's dolphin stuff.

WINSTON 	Hey, I-I know you kids don't like me, but I'm really trying here.

KEVIN 	All right, this is how it works.

KEVIN	There's a signal that tracks Bernie and the pod's locations at all times.

WINSTON 	So…


WINSTON	how do you do it? I mean, how do you track him?

KEVIN 	Well, by the GPS that was in Bernie when Marineland released him.

WINSTON 	Huh. Sounds pretty high-tech.How does How does it work?

KEVIN 	It's just an app. I unlock the code and track the signal.

WINSTON 	That's it? All you need is a code?

KEVIN 	It's pretty simple if you know what you're doing.

WINSTON 	Ah.

WINSTON 	6-4…

WINSTON	…8-5…

WINSTON	Oh, that's, um…Ah, that's my parole officer. You know, I'll call him later. Uh…

WINSTON	so I'm guessing a lot of people must have the code, then.

KEVIN 	No way. It's top-secret. Just me. Well, and my dad in case of an emergency, but...

HOLLY 	Hey, Winston. 

HOLLY	You working or on break again?

WINSTON 	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working. I'm working. Um...maybe you can tell me more later.

FRANKIE 	Hmm.

ABBY 	I just need a-a name.

FRANKIE 	Frankie.

ABBY 	Uh-huh.

FRANKIE 	Frankie Franklin will do.

DEVON	Relax. Relax...

DEVON	Mills, all right? So how do you like your sleeping quarters?

WINSTON 	Ah…

DEVON	I told you I'd pull some strings.

DEVON	Did you get the device?

WINSTON	Look, look, i-it's not a device.It's an app, but we we got a major problem. TheThe kid's the only one with the code.

DEVON	Look, Mills, I don't care what you have to do. Get me the information by tomorrow.

HOLLY 	Wish I could have gone to see Bernie with Kevin and Dad.

ABBY 	I know, honey. You know, Holly...

ABBY	I'm really proud of you for sticking with your commitment at Marineland, all right? That shows a lot of character. 

HOLLY	Thanks. 

HOLLY	I'm learning a lot about the animals. If we could only fix Rascal.

ABBY 	Yeah, well…

ABBY	well, maybe he'll come around and surprise you. All right? Speaking of, any surprises from our buddy Winston?

HOLLY 	He's acting okay, I guess.But I still don't trust him, though.

ABBY 	Look, remember, Holly, we're supposed to forgive others, all right? How 'bout giving him a second chance?

HOLLY 	Yes, ma'am.

HOLLY	I'm trying really hard.

ABBY 	That's my girl.

ABBY	Aha. I think I found our culprit.

HOLLY 	What is it?

ABBY 	See this cable wire? 

HOLLY 	Uh-huh. 

ABBY 	If this gets unplugged, the motor will stall, and we'll get big trouble. I guess Frankie Franklin will want the Done Gone to purr like a kitten, eh?

HOLLY 	Sure looks like that masters degree is paying off. I'm so proud of you.

ABBY 	Thank you, sweetie.

WINSTON 	We're a lot alike, you know? I've got problems. You've got problems.

WINSTON	We both been…

HOLLY 	He wants you to pet him, too?

HOLLY 	I didn't see this coming.

KEVIN 	Strange days, indeed.

HOLLY 	Hey, I got an idea.

HOLLY	Kev, your camera ready? 

KEVIN	Uh, yep.

HOLLY 	Okay, so when I…

HOLLY	give him the hand signal, toss him a fish.

WINSTON 	O-Okay.

WINSTON 	So… 

WINSTON 	So, uh, fish now?

HOLLY 	Okay, now. Good...

WINSTON 	Um…

WINSTON	sure.

WINSTON 	How'd they know about Devon?

HOLLY 	Hey, boys. What's up?

KEVIN 	This is Rocky, a loggerhead sea turtle.
