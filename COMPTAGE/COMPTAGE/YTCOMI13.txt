STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...

STORYTELLER	 ...he saw his chance!

STORYTELLER	Thomas and Friends. Really Useful around the World!
STORYTELLER	Thomas goes to Rio!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was travelling through the vast country of Brazil in South America.

STORYTELLER	He was pulling several different types of rolling stock down to Rio de Janeiro.

STORYTELLER	“Oi!” said one of Thomas’s passengers. Thomas was shocked! He thought it was a bit rude to say “Oi!”.

STORYTELLER	But then the passenger explained that, in Brazil, “Oi!” means “Hello!”.

STORYTELLER	“My name is Gustavo,” said the passenger. “And I am helping my fellow villagers take our produce to sell in the city of Rio de Janeiro!”

STORYTELLER	“My name is Thomas,” said Thomas. “And I am pleased to help!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas picked up more passengers – and crates of colourful, tropical fruit.

STORYTELLER	And at the next-to-last station, Thomas could hear a lot of commotion from his passengers. But he couldn’t see what was happening. So he was very surprised when...

STORYTELLER	...he rolled out of the station and heard a very loud noise! It was like every whistle on every platform at which Thomas had ever stopped, was being blown at once!

STORYTELLER	“What is happening?!” Thomas wanted to know.

STORYTELLER	“Welcome to the carnival!” said Gustavo.

STORYTELLER	Thomas said he’d never seen a carnival before. But Gustavo told him. “You’re not just seeing the carnival, Thomas... you are the carnival!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas, the number one blue engine, was a star the Rio de Janeiro carnival!
