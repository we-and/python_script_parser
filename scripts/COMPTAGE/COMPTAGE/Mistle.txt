(MISTLETOE MAGIC)


SONG	“ Hurry up and hey let's go Yeah it's coming Don’t be slow Trim your trees String the lights  Watch the sky For Santa's flight Christmas time anticipating Snowball fights And sledding skating Stockings hanging Stuffed with candy Cookies baking Presents waiting! Make some noise It's Christmas time! Get in the spirit! Make some noise It's Christmas time! Come on let's hear it! Make some noise It's Christmas time! Get in the spirit! Make some noise It's Christmas time! “

SANTA	Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho. Well, hello there. As you already know, this is my favorite time of year. There is nothing more magical than seeing the faces of children during Christmas time. Families spending time together,  eating delicious food and feeling the love that connects all of us. But every year, there are those who stop believing in the magic of Christmas. And we just can't let that happen now, can we? No, of course not.

HARPER	And that takes us to Christmas Eve where we're expecting seasonal temperatures along with a chance of snow.

BRAD	So, what you're saying is

NARRATIVE TITLE	HARPER HART CHANNEL 9 WEATHER

BRAD	that with a little Christmas magic, we could have some snow on Christmas Eve. Well, Santa's sleigh does run better in the snow, doesn't it, Harper?

HARPER	It sure does, Brad. So, let's cross our fingers for that Christmas magic. Reporting live from the Christmas skateathon,

NARRATIVE TITLE	LIVE CHANNEL 9 NEWS HARPER HART CHANNEL 9 WEATHER

HARPER	I'm Harper Hart, Channel 9 News.

CAMERAMAN	And we're out.

HARPER	Christmas magic, my foot.

CAMERAMAN	You know, the guys at the studio told me you're a bit of a—

HARPER	Grinch?

CAMERAMAN	You should be happy you're on holidays now until the new year, right?

HARPER	Great. I get to spend the next couple of days surrounded by all things Christmas. Rather be working.

CAMERAMAN	Grinch.

HARPER	Do you know why it snows? Ice crystals. They form in the upper clouds and when the temperature drops below zero degrees Celsiusand there's precipitation, we get snow.

CAMERAMAN	And that's all because of magic, right?

HARPER	No, it's science. Not magic. Oh no!

GIRL	Hello, Mrs. Hart. We were hoping we could get a photo with you.

HARPER	Of course.

NARRATIVE TITLE	MERRY CHRISTMAS

HARPER	And then, I went on a rant about there being no such thing as magic. And when I turned around, there were all these kidsthere, waiting to take a photo.

BRAD	Well, if you ask me, it sounds kind of funny.

HARPER	No, not funny, Brad. There are kids here.

BRAD	Pumpkin, everyone makes mistakes. You're a wonderful woman, don't sweat it.

HARPER	Thank you. I knew you'd make me feel better. So, what time are you picking me up?

BRAD	Uh…picking you up?

HARPER	We're going to my parents' place, remember?

BRAD	I'm having lunch with the station managers. I think they want me to host my own segment on the evening telecast. Isn't that great?

HARPER	Yeah, but we were gonna help my family set up the last of their Christmas decorations.

BRAD	Harper, you and I both dislike Christmas, and Christmas decorations. So—

HARPER	True. But my family loves this stuff. And it would be easier for me to deal if you were here. Cancelled on me three times.

BRAD	Harper, I gotta go. Gentlemen, thank you for waiting.

HARPER	Brad? Hello? Oh, I hate when he getsthis way. Well, I hope your meeting goes really, really well, Brad.

SANTA	Do I detect a hint of sarcasm? Be careful. You might end up on my naughty list.

HARPER	You're right. I'm sorry, sir.

SANTA	I hope everything is okay.

HARPER	Yes, sir. It's-- it's nothing.

SANTA	You can call me Santa if you like.

HARPER	It's not really my thing.

SANTA	Nonsense, Harper. I saw you earlier with that Santa hat and those wonderful Christmas earrings.

HARPER	You recognize me from the television. I only dress like this when I'm on the air. My producer makes me.

SANTA	Well, your producer is going on the nice list.

HARPER	You might want to double-check that one. I'm kidding. My producer's a great guy, most of the time.

SANTA	Well, let's see if we can get some of that Christmas spirit back in you.

HARPER	Sure. But I actually have to go right now. I'm really sorry to cut this conversation short. It was really nice to meet you.

SANTA	Oh.

HARPER	And great Santa suit. Very authentic.

SANTA	Well, thank you. My wife made it.

HARPER	And your beard, you can barely even tell that it's fake. Good job.

SONG	“Winter floats Confetti and December sky While the stars Twinkle like Christmas lights Jack Frost turned The skating pond to ice “

HARPER	The most wonderful time of the year. Humbug., it's me.

MRS. HART	There's my baby Harper.

HARPER	Mother!

MRS. HART	Hmm. Where's your boyfriend?

HARPER	Good question.

MRS. HART	I thought he was coming.

HARPER	So did I. He had a work thing that popped up.

MRS. HART	Oh, that poor man works too hard.

HARPER	Hey, Dad.

MR. HART	Hey.

HARPER	Mark.

MARK	Hey.

HOLLY	Hey! Harper.

HARPER	Hi, Holly.

HOLLY	Hi. Can I borrow you for a minute?

HARPER	Sure.

HOLLY	I'm so glad you're here.

HARPER	It's nice to see you too, little sis
.
HOLLY	Mistletoe.

HARPER	Candy cane.

HOLLY	What?

HARPER	Ihave no idea what we're talking about.

HOLLY	Family mistletoe. You had to find the magic one.

HARPER	Oh, okay. Why does everyone keep bringing up magic this time of the year? Look, Holly, I've told you like a hundred times, there is no such thing as magic.

HOLLY	Okay. Our grandparents, our parents, Mr. and Mrs. McKnight. Barry and Terry. Our cousin Heather, and the guy she married—

HARPER	Peter.

HOLLY	Peter, and the other Peter who married Stephanie and then Stephanie's friend—

HARPER	Okay, coincidence.  Highly uncommon coincidence, but coincidence, nonetheless.

HOLLY	When people kiss under our family's mistletoe, they fall in love. Period. Fact. Undeniable.

HARPER	Holly.

HOLLY	Harp, I think Mark is finally ready to propose.

HARPER	Oh my—

HOLLY	Shh. Mom and Dad don't know yet.

HARPER	I'm so happy for you.

HOLLY	And this is why I need that mistletoe. You had it last year when you volunteeredto host Christmas dinner, remember?

HARPER	Volunteered?

HOLLY	Yeah.

HARPER	Okay. The terms “peer pressured,” “guilted” and “shamed” come to mind. Okay, fine. I have it somewhere in my condo. I'll look for it tonight.

HOLLY	Thank you. Okay. Bring it to dinner on Christmas Eve, I'm gonna hang it in the doorway to the family room, and make sure Mark and I are accidentally standing under it at the same time.

HARPER	Aww, my kid sister getting married... before me.

HOLLY	Hey, you still have Brad. By the way, where is he?

BRAD 	So, I'm up for anything. I'm like, "Whatever you want to throw at me, I'll take." And we're going back and forth. And then Nelson mentions the possibility of me hosting my own investigative series.

HARPER	That's great.

BRAD	I know. It's-- I mean, it's super premature, but just the fact that the upper brass sees me in that light-- I mean, it speaks to so many things.

HOLLY	I think I'm going to order Chinese. Are you in?

HARPER	Hold on. Are we going out for dinner tonight?

BRAD	Ah, pumpkin, I can't. It's going to be a late night for meand I've got a bunch of stuff to finish up here at the station, so.

HARPER	Yeah, no worries. Elle and I are going to do Chinese.

BRAD	Okay, great. So, like I was saying, Nelson thinks I'm perfect for this. Just the place that I'm at in my career and my look and just like the physical presence I bring; I think it's gonna be really a great opportunity to showcase myself.

ELLE	So, your sister's getting engaged?

HARPER	Yeah.

ELLE	And she's younger than you, right?

HARPER	Yeah.

ELLE	Hmm. I can't believe that Brad bailed on you-- again.

HARPER	I just wish we were on the same page with this relationship, you know?

ELLE	Yeah, I get it. And it looks like he might be getting a promotion?

HARPER	Yeah, it looks like it.

ELLE	So how does he feel about you trying to get your own promotion?

HARPER	Well, I haven't exactly told him that I'm aiming for my own promotion.

ELLE	Really? So, let me get this straight. You want him to take the relationship more seriously and yet, you haven't told him about your promotion?

HARPER	Possible promotion. I thought we were getting Chinese food?

ELLE	Oh, yeah.The pizza guy?Way cuter.

HARPER	Fair enough. Hey, do you remember what I did with that box of Christmas decorations that I had here a year ago?

ELLE	Yeah. It used to be in my storage unit. You asked me to hold on to it for you.

HARPER	Used to be?

ELLE	Uh-huh. I donated a bunch of that stuff to the thrift shop last week.

HARPER	What?

ELLE	I needed the space. You said you didn't want anything in there.

HARPER	No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

NARRATIVE TITLE	CHRISTMAS

HARPER	I can't believe it's not here. My family's going to kill me.

ELLE	Wehave checked every box.

HARPER	She's never gonna forgive me.

ELLE	Ah, is this yours or mine?

HARPER	That one's mine.

ELLE	Oh, cool. Can I have it? You know me and hats.

HARPER	Sure.

ELLE	Why don't you just buy new mistletoe?

HARPER	There's no way. That mistletoe was special.

ELLE	Special?

HARPER	Hart family legend says that my grandparentsfirst kissed under that mistletoe on Christmas and were married soon after. Since then, anyone who kisses under the mistletoe is married before the following Christmas.

ELLE	A magic mistletoe? Why didn't you tell me? We need to keep looking.

HARPER	Okay. There is no such thing as magic. It's just some silly story, but everybody feels like it's magic, and now I'm the one who's lost it.

ELLE	At Christmas time too? Ouch!

HARPER	Thanks, Elle. You know, I forgot it was Christmas time.

ELLE	It was an accident. Your family will understand
.
HARPER	You don't understand. My family loves Christmas. They always have, and I just—

ELLE	You're a Grinch.

HARPER	Christmas just isn't my thing.

ELLE	Hmm. Neither is magic.Or luck.Or fun? You know what you need?

HARPER	A magic mistletoe?

ELLE	A Christmas miracle!

HARPER	Right. Because even though magic doesn't exist, miracles do.

ELLE	Why don't you believe?

HARPER	Because I'm an adult. There's no such thing as magic or miracles or luck. If you want something, you work hard to get it.

ELLE	Well, that's your opinion.

HARPER	No, it's literally a fact, Elle. Hard work is the answer.

ELLE	Is hard work gonna fix this problem for you? Or, will it take a little magic? Or like I like to say, a miracle of the Christmas variety?

HARPER	Hard work.

ELLE	Really?

HARPER	When did you drop off the boxes?

ELLE	Last week. Why?

HARPER	We'll go to the thrift store first thing in the morning and buy it back. I mean, the chances that someone got it are small, right? So, it's got to be there.
ELLE	Yeah, it's possible. But—

HARPER	Positive thinking, Elle.

ELLE	Okay. Oh my gosh, so cute. Ah!

HARPER	It's got to be here, right?

ELLE	It should be.

LUKE	Can I help you, ladies?

HARPER	Yes. I'm looking for a mistletoe.

LUKE	Well, there are plenty right there in front of you.

ELLE	True. But these aren't the right one.

LUKE	Looking for something in particular, Harper?

ELLE	You know Harper?

HARPER	Yes. That's me. Harper Hart. Metro News Channel9 meteorologist. Wow. That's a lot of Christmas you're sporting there. Does your manager make you wear that?

LUKE	I am the manager.

HARPER	Perfect. So, can you help me find my family's mistletoe? It's an heirloom, actually. Irreplaceable.

LUKE	Okay.

HARPER	And you see, my neighbor, Elle, she donated it by accident. I mean, well, technically, it wasn't her fault, per se. I told her she could throw away anything that was in the storage unit and I forgot that I had a box of Christmas decorations in there.

LUKE	You really don't recognize me, do you?

HARPER	I'm sorry, should I? Wait, are you-- are you Tracy's ex-boyfriend, Steve?

LUKE	I dated Tracy.

HARPER	Great! So, Steve, can you help me find my family's beloved mistletoe?

LUKE	But, my name's not Steve.

HARPER	Luke. Your name is Luke. I mean, of course I remember you, Luke.

LUKE	I don't think you do.

ELLE	Yeah, I'm with Luke on this one. I don't think you remember him either.

HARPER	Sure, I do. Luke, you know, it's just been a while. How you've been?

LUKE	Okay. I got to get back to work. But good luck finding your special mistletoe.

HARPER	No, wait. Please, I need your help. It's not for me, it's for my family. And they love Christmas more than anyone.

LUKE	You want me to help you find your mistletoe?

HARPER	Yes.

LUKE	The one that your neighbor accidentally donated, but that you can't find now, even though you ransacked this entire aisle?

HARPER	Yes. And I'll-- I'll clean that up.

LUKE	How exactly can I help? I mean, someone's obviously bought it, right?

HARPER	Well maybe we can ask your salespeople if they remember anyone buying it?

ELLE	Or, we can check the security footage, huh?

HARPER	Yeah.

LUKE	You want me to go through the security camera footage to look for the person who may have bought your missing mistletoe?

ELLE	Yeah.

HARPER	Yeah.

LUKE	Okay. When did you bring the decorations?

ELLE	Last week. It was Thursday. I remember because I went to the pizza place that day.

LUKE	All right. Thursday, I sold one box of decorations.

HARPER	Do you remember to who?

LUKE	Yeah. To my aunt, actually.

HARPER	Can we check the security camera footage and see if it was my mistletoe she bought? Look, I know that the chances are small, but I'm desperate.

LUKE	Well, it will take a Christmas miracle.

ELLE	That's what I said.

NARRATIVE TITLE	LUKE'S THRIFTS & TREASURES

LUKE	Okay.

HARPER	Did you work at Metro News? We had a Luke there a couple of years ago. He was a sound guy.

LUKE	Nope.

HARPER	Okay. This is really starting to bug me. Where do we know each other from?

LUKE	Oh, I'm not gonna tell you.

HARPER	Well,now you're just being mean. You might end up on the naughty list.

ELLE	So, Luke, you really seem to like Christmas.

LUKE	Oh, doesn't everybody?

ELLE	You'd think.	And your girlfriend, is she big into Christmas too?

LUKE	Oh, I don't actually have a girlfriend.

ELLE	Ah, interesting.

HARPER	You know what else is really interesting? Security camera footage.

LUKE	Like I said, I get this is a family heirloom and all, but you seem to be taking this really seriously?

HARPER	Well, I might not care for the holidays, but my family loves Christmas. And my sister thinks that her boyfriend's going to propose to her, so she needs this mistletoe to work its magic.

LUKE	So basically, I'm saving Christmas for you and your family.

HARPER	If you need to feel special about yourself, sure. You could put it that way.

LUKE	Hmm. Or I could just go back to work.

ELLE	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

HARPER	No, no, no.

LUKE	Okay. Got it. And there's my aunt on Thursday and... looks like she bought the whole box.

ELLE	That's it. That's the box that I brought in.

LUKE	So, my aunt has the box.

HARPER	That's great.

LUKE	Hmm. Now what?

HARPER	You give me her address and I go over there.

LUKE	I can't do that.

HARPER	Well, I'm not gonna break into her house and rob her.

ELLE	Luke. Lukey, my man. Trust me. I know Harper, and there's only like a 40% chance that she would ever do something that crazy.

HARPER	Yeah. I'm just gonna knock on the door and offer to buy it back.

LUKE	Hmm. I'll go with you. She-- she doesn't live too far from here.

HARPER	Great.

ELLE	Well, you two might have all the time in the world, but I actually have to work this afternoon. Looks like you guys are on your own.

HARPER	Just Luke and I?

ELLE	Oh yeah.

HARPER	Hmm-mm. Did we go to college together?

LUKE	Close. Come on.

HARPER	Why can't I remember where we've met?

LUKE	Well, it says more about you than it does me.

HARPER	Can you please just tell me?

LUKE	Okay, sure. You and I—

ROBERT	Hello.

LUKE	Hi. Is Katherine here?

ROBERT	Yeah, she is. Kitty Cat, it's for you. Ah, please, come in.

LUKE	Thanks. Hi.

HARPER	Okay.

ROBERT	She'll be here in a sec. I'm making cookies.

HARPER	So, who is that guy?

LUKE	I have no idea. I thought my aunt was single.

KATHERINE	Luke, honey. Look at you! What a sweet surprise.

LUKE	Aunt Katherine, how are you?

KATHERINE	Oh.

LUKE	Oh, boy. I'm sorry to come unannounced like this.

KATHERINE	Oh, don't be silly. You can drop by anytime. And who is this lovely lady?

LUKE	Lovely la-- oh, sorry, Aunt Katherine. This is Harper. Harper, this is my aunt.

KATHERINE	Nice to meet you.

HARPER	Nice to meet you too. So, Katherine, I have a business proposition—

KATHERINE	Is she your girlfriend?

LUKE	Uh, no, no, she's an old friend.

KATHERINE	Really?

HARPER	Really?

LUKE	Yeah. Aunt Katherine, who was that man that answered the front door?

KATHERINE	That's Robert. He's my boyfriend.

LUKE	Your boyfriend? Since when do you have a—

HARPER	Uh,before we get too far off track here, can I just ask you about the decorations?

KATHERINE	Decorations? I love decorations.

HARPER	Oh no, not these ones.

KATHERINE	What's wrong with these ones?

HARPER	Nothing.

LUKE	Aunt Katherine, the other day, you came by the storeand bought a box of decorations.

KATHERINE	So?

LUKE	Well, Harper here—

HARPER	I donated them by accident. Well, technically, my neighbor did. But regardless, I need them back.

KATHERINE	You want them back?

HARPER	Yes.

LUKE	Aunt Katherine, what Harper's trying to say is, I'm sure she'd be willing to buy them back from you.

HARPER	Yes. What he said.

KATHERINE	But I don't have them anymore.

LUKE	Oh.

ROBERT	Here you go, freshly baked Christmas cookies.

KATHERINE	Thank you, Robbie Bear.

ROBERT	Anything for my Kitty Cat.

KATHERINE	Oh.

LUKE	All right, wait. How do you two—

HARPER	So, the Christmas decorations. What happened to them, and where are they?

KATHERINE	Oh, they weren't for me.

HARPER	Who were they for?

KATHERINE	Santa.

LUKE	What?

KATHERINE	I have a friend who works as a mall Santa. His photo booth needed some extra decorations. So he asked me to help.

ROBERT	Christmas cookie?

HARPER	Why not?

LUKE	Oh, sure.

KATHERINE	Oh—

LUKE	Ahh. Okay.

HARPER	Thank you, Robert.

ROBERT	You're welcome, Harper. Wait. Harper. Harper Hart, the weather person for Metro News?

HARPER	That's me.

ROBERT	Looka here, Kitty Cat. You have a celebrity in the house.

KATHERINE	Well, I wish I had known. Then I would've cleaned up a little. Oh, look at you, Luke. You were always lucky with the ladies.

LUKE	Oh no, we're not dating. And I was never lucky with the ladies.

KATHERINE	You're right. You weren't very lucky. But look at her. She's cute as a button.

LUKE	Aunt Katherine.

HARPER	That's very sweet of you, but I'm actually seeing someone.

ROBERT	Is it Brad Rockwood from Channel 9, huh? He's a handsome man.

HARPER	Brad? No, no.

KATHERINE	They can't date. That would be improper.

HARPER	She's right.

KATHERINE	Besides, my nephew is better looking than that man, isn't he?

HARPER	Your nephew is plenty good looking. But I feel like we're getting off track again. Your mall Santa friend. Where can we find him?

KATHERINE	He has a cute little photo stand in the Antique Mall just over on Main Street.

HARPER	Oh, that's not far. Thank you. Let's go?

LUKE	Yeah. Actually, just wait. When did all this happen? How'd you two meet?

KATHERINE	Actually, it had to do with that box of decorations.

HARPER	Really? Oh, how?

KATHERINE	I was dropping them off to my Santa friend and I was jumping into the cab.

ROBERT	Ta-da!

KATHERINE	And wouldn't you know it, Robert was driving.

ROBERT	[laughs] We knew each other years ago, but we had lost contact.

KATHERINE	He offered to buy me a coffee.

ROBERT	And here we are, a week later.

KATHERINE	Mm-mm-mm.

HARPER	Can we go now?

LUKE	Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay. Thanks, guys. We'll see you later. All right, this is amazing. A real magic mistletoe.

HARPER	What are you talking about?

LUKE 	Okay. Hear me out. Your magic mistletoe is in the box of decorations, right?

HARPER	Yeah.

LUKE	And, well, my aunt's been single for years. And—

HARPER	Don't even suggest it.

LUKE	I'm not suggesting it. I-- I'm just saying I'm glad that my aunt had some of the mistletoe magic rub off on her.

HARPER	Are you suggesting that your aunt and Robert met because of a mistletoe?

LUKE	Yeah. Usually these things only happen in the movies. Did you see how cute they were together?

HARPER	Old people are always cute together.

LUKE	I'm just glad she had a chance to buy your magic mistletoe.

HARPER	Okay. There's no such thing as magic. And there's certainly no such thing as a magic mistletoe.

LUKE 	Okay. Then how do you explain them running into each other, hmm?

HARPER	Random, probably.

LUKE	Hmm. I have a feeling this is going to be a magical Christmas.

HARPER	Really?

LUKE	Yeah.

HARPER	Oh, no!

LUKE	What?

HARPER	The mall Santa hours closed at noon, so we missed it.

LUKE	Well, I guess we'll continue our search for the missing magic mistletoe tomorrow.

HARPER	Well, tomorrow's Christmas Eve, and I need to bring it to my parents' place.

LUKE	All right, well, I'll meet you there in the morning. We'll have plenty of time. And we will find it, I promise.

HARPER	Oh, a promise?

LUKE	And I always keep my promises.

HARPER	Thank you for all of your help, Luke. I owe you one.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	I just wish there was some way I could repay the favor.

LUKE	Well, I guess I could use a little help in something I'm doing this afternoon, if you're free?

HARPER	Well, since my search for the missing mistletoe is postponed until tomorrow, looks like I have some free time on my hands.

LUKE	Great.

HARPER	Great.

MAN	Hey Luke, thanks for the winter jackets you donated last week. It really helped Mrs. Mitchell's family.

LUKE	Ah, hey, it's my pleasure. Happy to help.

HARPER	Do you volunteer here a lot?

LUKE	Yeah. Yeah, it's-- yeah. It's a-- it's a difficult time for some people. So, I-- I help out as much as I can. You know, making lunches, and warm meals. And I'll try to help people and families that need an extra hand.

HARPER	Who are you? Okay. No, seriously. Who are you? You gotta tell me how we know each other because it is bugging me.

LUKE	Okay. We went to school together.

HARPER	What? What school?

LUKE	All of 'em. Well, I mean, from grade school to junior high to real high school.

HARPER	No, we didn't.

LUKE	Yeah, we did.

HARPER	No, it's not possible. I would have recognized you.

LUKE	Okay. Picture me 50 pounds heavier, terrible brush cut, and always reading comic books.

HARPER	Lucas? Oh my gosh, it is you. What happened?

LUKE	What-- well... let's see, freshman year of college, I ditched the comic books and started socializing more. Sophomore year, I joined the water polo club and by senior year, I lost a lot of weight, and I guess, gained a fresh perspective on life.

HARPER	Well, congratulations, I guess.

LUKE	Thank you, I guess.

HARPER	I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to come out like that. It's just-- wow.

LUKE	Do you want a coffee or something?

HARPER 	I actually hate coffee, but I like tea. English Breakfast?

LUKE	Oh, okay. Well, I think you might be in luck, 'cause we just might have some of that here. I’ll get you one.

HARPER	Lucas!

LUKE	How's the tea?

HARPER	It's perfect.

LUKE	Great. So, your neighbor—

HARPER	Elle?

LUKE	Elle, yes. She-- she pulled me aside back at the thrift store.

HARPER	Oh, no. Did she say anything inappropriate?

LUKE	No. Does she usually?

HARPER	Elle can be-- direct.

LUKE	Oh. Well, we just talked. But she's now following me on social media.

HARPER	Which one?

LUKE	All of 'em.

HARPER	Yeah. Elle can get like that around cute guys.

LUKE	Oh. So now I'm cute.

HARPER	No.

LUKE	Oh.

HARPER	What I meant was that she—Elle-- obviously thinks that you are.

LUKE	Oh, okay. But, you know, what...

HARPER 	Ah, you know, you have nice hair and muscles and smile. And you are kind of saving the world, so maybe like a little bit.

LUKE 	Wow. I can't believe the prettiest girl in school just said I'm kinda cute.

HARPER	Are you blushing?

LUKE	Maybe.

HARPER	Okay, now that is cute. I bet Elle wishes she was here to see that.

LUKE	Well, she can. I got an idea.

HARPER	What?

LUKE	Well, we can take a selfie for Elle.

HARPER	For Elle?

LUKE	Okay. Well, maybe for all my old high school buddies since they won't believe I'm hanging out with Harper Hart.

HARPER	Okay. For Elle, and your high school buddies.

LUKE	All right. Here we go. Yeah. Hmm.

HARPER	That is horrible.

LUKE	What? Why?

HARPER	Well, it looks like one of us is holding the other hostage, but I can't figure out which one is the hostage and which one's the hostage taker.

LUKE	Oh—

HARPER	I'm a professional.

LUKE	Okay. Wow, you're-- you're good at this.

HARPER	Yeah. Years of selfies with fans.

LUKE	Wait. Weather people have fans?

HARPER	Why does it look like you're taking a photo with your aunt? Let's try that again. Just—

LUKE	Yeah.

HARPER	Get closer and smile.

LUKE	Okay. Well, this-- this'll do.

HARPER	Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that'll be enough to get Elle's attention and your high school buddies’. I should go.

LUKE	Yeah. I-- I should too. I got--you know, stuff to do back at the store. So I'll see you tomorrow?

HARPER	You don't have to come. I mean, I've already borrowed so much of your time, and tomorrow's Christmas Eve, so you probably have plans.

LUKE	No. You know, my family's all out of the city. And I don't have a girlfriend or a cat or a dog. Not even a goldfish. Plus, I-- I want to see your magic mistletoe. I-- who knows? Maybe it'll bring me luck.

HARPER	Okay.

LUKE	'Kay.

ELLE	So, he's gorgeous, and he does volunteer work?

HARPER	Yup.

ELLE	And you two were just hanging out?

HARPER	What else were you expecting?

ELLE	I don't know. Maybe dinner? Or at least a future plan for dinner.

HARPER	Elle, I have a boyfriend.

ELLE	No, you don't. What you have is a Brad.

HARPER	Who is my boyfriend. Kind of.

ELLE	If he's your boyfriend, then what's that all about?

HARPER	That is just two old friends catching up.

ELLE	With two very big smiles.

HARPER	Okay. I told him he has a cute smile.

ELLE	Why would you do that?

HARPER	I don't know. Just came up in conversation.

ELLE	Okay. Circle of truth. Do you like Luke?

HARPER	No.

ELLE	Really? Because it seems like you do.

HARPER	No.

ELLE	Okay then. I guess you won't mind if I ask him out?

HARPER	No, of course not.

ELLE	Really?

HARPER	Yeah. I mean, go for it. He's a great guy.

ELLE	Hmm-mm.

HARPER	I mean, maybe, don't ask him out right away because it is the holidays and it might be weird. So maybe in like a-- a month or two.

ELLE	A month or two?

HARPER	Yeah.

SONG	“ I made a promise On Christmas Eve To cut back on all The holiday treats No more empty calories No sugar” 

HARPER	Thanks again for coming with me today.

NARRATIVE TITLE	MEET SANTA

HARPER	I'm sure the store is busy.

LUKE	Oh no. I'm always closed on Christmas Eve. I let the big stores handle the last-minute shoppers.

HARPER	Smart.

LUKE	Oh. Ah! There he is.

HARPER	What gave it away? Was it the red suit, hat and beard? Hello? Hi, Mr. Santa. Hello.

LUKE	I-- it's not Mr. Santa. Just Santa.

HARPER	Santa?

LUKE	Yeah.

MRS. CLAUS	Can I help you, Miss?

HARPER	Thank you. Yes. We just need to ask Mr. Santa something.

MRS. CLAUS	Oh, no, it's just Santa.

LUKE	Told you. His last name is Claus. Technically would be Mr. Claus, but everyone just calls him Santa
.
HARPER	We're not asking Santa for any presents. We just need to ask him to give us something back that's very important to me for Christmas.

MRS. CLAUS	Oh, really?

HARPER	Maybe it does sound like I'm asking for presents, but we're not.

MRS. CLAUS	Back of the line. Hmm. Okay?

LUKE	Okay.

HARPER	Okay.

SONG	“ Frosty has his top hat Rudolph his red nose”

LUKE	Oh, come on. Who could be this agitated waiting in line to get their photo with Santa?

HARPER	No, it's not funny. It's my boyfriend. He just said there's a chance that he might not be able to meet my family tonight.

LUKE	Your boyfriend. You didn't mention him the other day.

HARPER	Yeah. Yeah. He's just some guy from work. He's been really busy lately.

LUKE	Well, it's-- you know, it's Christmas time. It's the holidays. People get busy.

HARPER	This holiday makes people crazy.

LUKE	Hey, since when did you stop liking Christmas? You weren't always this way.

HARPER	What do you mean?

LUKE	Well, as a kid, I'd walk by your house every day to school. And at Christmas time, your house was the most decorated I have ever seen.

HARPER	Yeah. It still is.

LUKE	Really?

HARPER	But that was my family's doing, not mine.

LUKE	Oh, okay. Well, growing up around all this Christmas cheer, how did you become such a—

HARPER	A Grinch?

LUKE	I-- I didn't say it.

HARPER	No, but it's true. I am.

LUKE	So?

HARPER	It's a long story.

LUKE	Oh, well, we got time.

HARPER	When I was a kid—

LUKE	Hmm?

HARPER	I loved my grandma so much. She was this amazing woman. She was a scientist back when women weren't usually scientists.

LUKE	Oh, wow.

HARPER	Yeah. She was so smart. I got my love of science from her. We were like best friends.

LUKE	Hmm. Sounds like an amazing role model to grow up with.

HARPER	Yeah, she was. And then just before Christmas, when I was nine, she passed away.

LUKE	Oh, Harper. I'm sorry. That-- that must have been so difficult.

HARPER	Yeah. Yeah, it was. I was devastated and before I knew it, the holidays came around, and my parents did what they always did. They decorated the house. They were acting like they were happy.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	And I guess I resented it. Yeah, I couldn't understand how they could just move on with Christmas and life without her.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	Just felt fake.

LUKE	Well, you were a kid. That's understandable.

HARPER	I guess this whole buying presents and throwing parties this time of the year, regardless of what's going on in our lives, just feels forced.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	Like people going through the motions.

LUKE	Well, I think people build traditions so that as generations change, they can be honored and remembered. And regardless of what people are doing in their lives, I feel these yearly traditions, they keep families together. They bring happiness in the good times, and peace and comfort in the difficult times. Going through the motions, as you say, just-- it brings comfort into people's lives when they're going through a difficult time. You're very lucky that your family still celebrates together.

HARPER	Never thought of it that way. Thank you.

MRS. CLAUS	Folks, you're next.

LUKE	Oh. Okay. Santa!

SANTA	Sit down, young man.

HARPER	Oh, you're really sitting down. Okay.

LUKE	Yes, you'll--Oh, you'll have to excuse my friend here, Santa. She's not the biggest fan of Christmas these days.

SANTA	Oh, it seems Harper hasn't been a fan of Christmas for a while now.

HARPER	You again? I saw him a few days ago at the ice rink.

LUKE	A Santa at Christmas? Weird.

HARPER	No, like literally the exact same Santa.

LUKE	Oh.

SANTA	It's nice seeing you again, Harper.

MRS. CLAUS	Are we ready to get a picture taken with Santa Claus?

HARPER	Sure. Why not?

LUKE	So, Harper, weren't you gonna ask Santa?

HARPER	Oh, right. The mistletoe. Santa, a few days ago, a woman named Katherine—

LUKE 	My aunt.

HARPER	Yes, Aunt Katherine, she brought in a box of Christmas decorations.

SANTA	Yeah, she did. It was faster than going back to the North Pole and getting my own.

HARPER	Ok-- okay. Focus. So, in that box of Christmas decorations was a mistletoe that is very important to me and my family.

SANTA	A mistletoe?

LUKE	A magic mistletoe.

SANTA	A magic mistletoe?

LUKE	Yeah.

HARPER	No, just a mistletoe. A regular, everyday mistletoe that,again, just so happens to be very important to me and my family.

SANTA	Why is it so important?

LUKE	Well, because of its ability to spread magic everywhere it goes.

SANTA	That is special.

LUKE	Yeah.

HARPER	So, the mistletoe. Can I have it back, please?

SANTA	I'm sure you can.

HARPER	Great.

SANTA	But I don't have it anymore.

HARPER	Where is it?

SANTA	Well, a mall Santa doesn't really have any use for mistletoe.

LUKE	Yeah. True.

HARPER	Please tell me you didn't get rid of it.

SANTA	Oh, don't be silly. I gave it to a buddy of mine.

HARPER	Urgh, not again.

MRS. CLAUS	Well, hold on, Santa. There you go.

SANTA	Thank you, Mrs. Claus.

HARPER	So, your friend. Where can we find him?

SANTA	He has a special Christmas tree shop on the other end of the city. I can give you the name.

HARPER	Yes, please. Just enter it into my phone.

MRS. CLAUS	Smile.

LUKE	Oh. Wow. This is an interesting Santa photo.

HARPER	It's horrible.

LUKE	Too bad. I posted it.
	
HARPER	Oh no, I'm not talking about that. This Christmas tree farm is literally on the other side of the city.

LUKE 	So?

HARPER	So, it's Christmas Eve and I have to be at my parents' house for dinner tonight.

LUKE	Well, don't worry. We got-- we got plenty of time.

HARPER	Luke, you've been great. And I can't thank you enough, but you don't have to come along. I mean, I know it's Christmas Eve and all.

LUKE	Are you crazy? I wanna see this adventure to the very end.

HARPER	You sure?

LUKE	Helping an old friend find a magic mistletoe on Christmas Eve. Hmm. Yeah, I'm sure.

HARPER	You know how much it irks me every time you say magic, don't you?

LUKE	I do. Oh, and what was that wink that Mrs. Claus gave Santa?

HARPER	I know. How awkward was that?

LUKE	So awkward. But what if—

HARPER	No, no. Don't do that.

LUKE	No. No, what if Santa and Mrs. Claus only started winking after Santa picked the box with the mistletoe?

HARPER 	That wink was not because of my family's mistletoe.

LUKE	How long are you gonna deny this streak before until it becomes unavoidable?

HARPER	It's been a long day.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	It's Elle.

LUKE	Okay. Well, I'm gonna grab some coffee. Do you want something?

HARPER	Tea? English—

LUKE	Yeah. English Breakfast with milk and sugar. I remember from yesterday.

ELLE	Having a good day, huh?

HARPER	How could you tell?

ELLE	How's the hunt going for the missing mistletoe?

HARPER	Not great. Luke and I have-- drove all over town trying to find this thing.

ELLE	You and Luke? It sounds like you're spending a lot of time with your old school buddy.

HARPER	Well, we weren't exactly buddies back in the day, but we knew each other.

ELLE 	Either way, this photo of you two with Santa--hmm, so cute.

HARPER	I can't believe he posted that.

ELLE	Hey, if Brad can't be at your parents' place for Christmas dinner, maybe Luke would be there for you
.
HARPER	Look, I know Brad bails a lot, but he knows how important this is to me. He's gonna be there.

ELLE	Well, it is the time of year for miracles.

HARPER	So, what are you doing tonight?

ELLE	Oh, just wrapping up the last of the Christmas gifts. You are going to love what I got you.

HARPER	Great. Yeah. You're gonna love what I got for you too.

ELLE	So, can we meet up tomorrow and exchange gifts?

HARPER	Yeah, of course. Hey, Luke is on his way back. So, I'm going to let you go.

ELLE	Okay. Bye.

HARPER	Bye.

LUKE	Hey. What's wrong?

HARPER	I forgot to get a Christmas present for Elle.

LUKE	It's okay. We'll just get it here.

HARPER	Last minute shopping on Christmas Eve? And crossing town to find a Christmas tree farm. Plus, I still have to go home and change for Christmas Eve dinner. I'm never going to make it all on time.

LUKE	Yes, you will. I have an idea. See? Problem solved. Private shopping with no crowded malls. Plus, you get to pick any outfit you like for Christmas dinner tonight. That should save us enough time to finish our magic mistletoe mission.

HARPER	You're a genius.

LUKE	Yeah.

SONG	“ I need you Christmas I need you now I try and I try And I try And I don't know how To bring back the laughter Bring back the joy Of a childon Christmas morning Filled with toys”

LUKE	You look—

HARPER	Decent?

LUKE	Beautiful.

HARPER	Thank you. But I still need to get something for Elle.

LUKE	Hmm. One final touch.

HARPER	A hat. That's it. She loves hats. Thanks for helping me out with this crazy quest.

LUKE	Are you kidding me? I love quests.

HARPER	Seriously. It's nice not having to do this alone.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	Brad would never do this with me.

LUKE	Well, it's Christmas. I feel it's my duty to help people out.

HARPER	Also, when we were at the mall waiting for Santa—

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	And I told you about my grandma...

LUKE	Yeah?

HARPER	Thanks for listening. And thanks for the new perspective.

LUKE	Anytime. And thank you for trusting me enough to tell me.

HARPER	Well, we do go way back.

LUKE	We do. And to be honest, I'm having fun tracking down your magic mistletoe.

HARPER	Me too.

NARRATIVE TITLE	FAKE CHRISTMAS TREES FOR SALE

HARPER	Fake Christmas trees, huh?

LUKE	Wait, this guy sells fake Christmas trees at a Christmas tree stand?

HARPER	It's brilliant.

LUKE	How?

HARPER	Well, maybe not everybody wants a real tree.

LUKE	Oh, come on. Who doesn't want a real tree? The way they look, the way they make your house smell, it's all part of the Christmas experience.

HARPER	Well, I for one, don't like the idea of using a real tree.

LUKE	Do you have any idea how bad plastic trees are for the environment?

HARPER	But they last so much longer than just one season.

LUKE	Oh.

HARPER	Do you know how much carbon gas is put into the air by cutting down and shipping trees every year? Now multiply that by the ten years you have one fake Christmas tree.

LUKE	I think I'm losing my mind here.

HARPER	Hmm, you really are upset.

LUKE	Yep.

HARPER	It's cute.

LUKE	Excuse me? Excuse me? Can you tell us about your trees here?

HARPER	I don't even think they realize we're here.

LUKE	No. Hello?

BUDDY	You'll have to excuse my two salespeople here. They've fallen down with a bad case of puppy love, I'm afraid.

LUKE	Buddy?

HARPER	Buddy?

BUDDY	That's me, Buddy of Buddy's Fake Christmas Tree Stand.

LUKE	Huh. So, Buddy, what's going on here? Why are you selling fake Christmas trees at a Christmas tree stand?

BUDDY	It's just like your girlfriend said.

LUKE	We're not together.

HARPER	Oh, we're not together.

BUDDY	Oh, okay. Anyway, it's just like the lady said. You know, fake Christmas trees last longer and ultimately, they're better for the environment.

LUKE	Yeah, even though they're plastic? And they end up at landfills?

BUDDY	No, no, no. Not these ones here. They're all made out of completely recycled materials.

HARPER	Recycled?

BUDDY	Uh-huh. Even better.

HARPER	I've been trying to get everyone to make the switch for years.

BUDDY	Ah, good for you.

LUKE	But why sell them at a Christmas tree stand?

BUDDY	Well, just because you're getting a fake tree doesn't mean you have to miss out on the whole Christmas tree buying experience.

LUKE	Well, that part's nice. I--I did love shopping for the perfect tree with my parents.

BUDDY	So, what type of tree are you two looking for? I can give you a great deal on these pre-lits over here.

LUKE	Actually, we're not looking for a tree.

HARPER	We're looking for a particular mistletoe.

BUDDY	Are you-- are you sure you two aren't a couple?

HARPER	Look, I know it sounds funny, but my family has this "magic"

LUKE	Magic.

HARPER	mistletoe

BUDDY	that my friend accidentally donated along with a box of decorations to his thrift store.

LUKE	And by chance, my aunt bought that box of decorations. And it turns out she bought it for a friend who runs a Santa booth at the antique mall.

HARPER	 Hmm-mm. And we tracked down that mall Santa and he said that he has no use for mistletoe, and that he gave it to you.

BUDDY	Ah.

LUKE	Ring any sleigh bells?

BUDDY	Yeah, I know the Santa you're talking about. He's a good guy. I was just there the other day with my kids getting their Christmas photo shoot done. And we started talking about the tree stand.

HARPER	Yeah, that Santa really loves to chat.

LUKE	Hmm.

BUDDY	Yeah. Well, he said he had these decorations he didn't want anymore. Asked me if I wanted them, and I said sure. So, if you want to see the mistletoe, they're right back here.

HARPER	Great.

LUKE	Great.

HARPER	No, it's not here. I don't see it. Do you have any more somewhere?

BUDDY	Uh-uh. Sorry. Those are the only ones I have.

HARPER	Mine was held together with a red and green wire. Almost like-- like a pipe cleaner, and it has a red bow on the bottom.

LUKE	Here, let me take another look.

BUDDY	No, no, no, no. Wait, I remember that one.

HARPER	You do?

BUDDY	A big red bow. Yeah. My sales kid, it's the only thing he sold this week. To some guy that I've seen around the neighborhood. He owns a bar just down the road.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	Let's go.

LUKE	Yeah. It-- wait. Hold on. How long have those two been so cozy for?

BUDDY	Ah, a few days now.

LUKE	You don't say. Right about the time that mistletoe showed up?

BUDDY	Hmm, right about that time. Yeah.

LUKE	Interesting. Hmm?

BUDDY	Yeah. Those kids haven't been able to sell anything since, but I don't have the heart to fire them at Christmas.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	People fall in love all the time during the holidays.

LUKE	Sure they do. Magic.

BUDDY	I'll fire them after New Year's.

LUKE	Okay. First there was Aunt Katherine running into Robert in a taxi, hmm?

HARPER	There is no such thing as magic.

LUKE	And then there was that cute little wink and smile between Santa and Mrs. Claus. Probably not their real names, but—

HARPER	You're really going out on a limb for that one, huh?

LUKE	But it was cute. Obviously, they'd been touched by the magic mistletoe.

HARPER	I think you're misusing the word "obvious."

LUKE	All right. And then there's Buddy's Fake Christmas Tree Stand. As strange as a concept as it was.

HARPER	And if by strange you mean brilliant.

LUKE	Okay, he has two lovebirds who just happen to fall in puppy love right around the time they come into contact with said missing magic mistletoe.

HARPER	Okay, they're kids on a break from school, spending time together. I think it's a pretty common way for kids to fall in love.

LUKE	You know what I love? How you continue to refuse to believe in the magic of your family's mistletoe in the face of irrefutable evidence.

HARPER	Okay. Again, I think you're misusing the word "irrefutable" and "evidence."

LUKE	Hmm. Not according to my law degree.

HARPER 	Law degree? You run a thrift shop.

LUKE	I don't, actually. I started a chain of charity thrift stores to help people buy things they couldn't otherwise afford.

HARPER	Wait, so you're a lawyer?

LUKE	I used to practice law, but I don't anymore.

HARPER	Well, that's crazy.

LUKE	That's what my mom said. And my ex-girlfriend at the time.

HARPER	Wait, so you gave up your career as a lawyer so that you could run a charity?

LUKE	Yeah.

HARPER 	Huh. You really are full of surprises, Lucas.

LUKE	The name's Luke, and everybody loves surprises. We're here.  Let's go.

LUKE	Can you see it?

HARPER 	Not yet. Oh, I see it. It's over by the bar.

LUKE	Yeah?

HARPER	Let's go. Ummm. Hi.

BOUNCER	We're closed.

HARPER	Uh... what?

BOUNCER	Sorry. Have a good night, folks. Merry Christmas.

LUKE	No, wait. We-- We have to come inside.

BOUNCER	I thought I made myself clear. We are closed.

HARPER	I don't understand. It's still early.

BOUNCER	Okay. It's Christmas Eve. People like to spend Christmas Eve with their loved ones.

LUKE	Yeah, he's got a point.

BOUNCER	We're closed. Merry Christmas. Again.

HARPER	Ummm... wait, sir. My friend has to use the restroom really, really bad.

LUKE	I do?

HARPER	Hmm-mm.

LUKE	Oh. I do. Real bad, you know? Okay. Okay, so why'd you tell him I had to go to the washroom?

HARPER	I don't know. It's all I could come up with. Look, we needed to get in, and now we're in.

LUKE	Well, you're right. So, what's the game plan here? Do we just steal his mistletoe?

HARPER	Oh, it's my mistletoe.

LUKE	No, it's-- actually technically not your mistletoe. Huh?

HARPER	Okay. Listen, Mr. Lawyer, we have come too far for something to go wrong. What if he doesn't want to sell it?

LUKE	What do we do then, hmm?

HARPER	I'm going to go distract the bouncer.

LUKE	How?

HARPER	I don't know, maybe he likes meteorology.

LUKE	Nobody likes meteorology.

HARPER	Lots of people do.

LUKE	Weather people, but not normal people who work in bars.

HARPER	Okay. Are we going to make fun of my profession? Or are we going to do this?

LUKE	Okay. All right. So what do I do, hmm?

HARPER	You go over there, untie the mistletoe. Hide it in your jacket. And then give me a signal, and we'll go.

LUKE	Yeah, okay. Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, what's the signal?

HARPER	I don't know.

LUKE	I got it. It's me running out the bar as fast as I can, okay?

BOUNCER	Hey.

LUKE	Yeah.

BOUNCER	Washroom's this way.

LUKE	Got it. Thank you. Be right over.

HARPER	Just be cool.

LUKE	Whoo! Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

HARPER	Be cool.

LUKE	Yeah. Yeah.

HARPER	We got this.

LUKE	Do we?

HARPER	Yeah.

LUKE	Okay. Gosh, I'm really bad at these things.

HARPER	Relax. Nobody's going to jail today.

LUKE	Oh, yeah, nobody's going to jail. Why would anyone go to jail?

HARPER	Probably.

LUKE	What?

HARPER	Focus.

LUKE	Hey, I was just going.

HARPER	Hi.

BOUNCER	Hello.

HARPER	How's it going?

BOUNCER	It's good.

HARPER	Good. Yeah, I'm doing good too.

BOUNCER	Great.

HARPER	So how long have you worked here?

BOUNCER	A while.

LUKE	Hey... Okay.

BOUNCER	Hey!

LUKE	Hey. What?

BOUNCER	What in the name of Christmas do you think you're doing?

LUKE	What? Who? Me? Why?

BOUNCER	Are you trying to steal that mistletoe?

LUKE	Steal-- what mistletoe? I—

BOUNCER	The one you're trying to untie.

LUKE	Ah—

HARPER	Ah. Mr. Bouncer, sir. This is my fault.

BOUNCER	Okay. What the heck is going on? You got to use the bathroom or not?

LUKE	I didn't, but now-- now I do.

HARPER	I'm sorry. But this is my family's mistletoe and it's an heirloom that I mistakenly-- well, actually my friend, Elle, she's kind of quirky and--Right. It was donated to Luke's thrift shop and, well, we kind of traced it back to your bar.

LUKE	Yeah. And we're kind of like detectives.

HARPER	Yeah. And my sister, she thinks her boyfriend's going to propose to her this Christmas and it's kind of a family tradition. She wants to kiss him under the mistletoe.

BOUNCER	That's a cute story and all, but I can't give you this mistletoe. I-I—

HARPER	Please, you have to understand this means the world to my family.

BOUNCER	But I can't give it to—

LUKE	We'd be willing to buy it from you.

HARPER	Absolutely.

LUKE	Yeah. Yeah, no? Ah, I can replace it. I've got-- I've got a shelf full of mistletoes and--and garlands if you want, yeah? Wreaths. I have lovely wreaths.

HARPER	Oh, you should see his wreaths. They're beautiful.

LUKE	Thank you.

HARPER	Oh, they are.

BOUNCER	Listen, I can't let you take the mistletoe because it's not my bar. I'm just a bouncer. You’ll have to talk to my boss, the owner.

LUKE	Are you sure we can't just work something out? You know, among the three of us here?

BOUNCER	My boss can get pretty weird about this kind of stuff.

LUKE	Weird?

BOUNCER	You'll see. You want that mistletoe? You have to wait till he gets here.

LUKE	I guess we wait.

HARPER	We're cutting it really close.

LUKE	I know. We'll-- we'll get it in time. Don't worry.

BOUNCER	Can I offer you two a drink while you wait?

HARPER	Oh, I'm driving.

LUKE	Don't drink.

BOUNCER	I have hot cocoa.

HARPER	Sure.

LUKE	Sure.

HARPER	So, what about you? Why haven't you gotten married yet?

LUKE	Well, you know how it is. Finding the right person and all.

HARPER	Well, there must've been someone?

LUKE	There was this amazing woman from law school.

HARPER	Sounds promising. What happened?

LUKE	I hated the hours worked being a lawyer and I-- mostly the people I worked with, I didn't like, so....

HARPER	Hmm. Yeah, I've been there.

LUKE	Yeah. I needed a change. I--I wanted my life to mean more than just billable hours.

HARPER	So that's when you started the thrift store?

LUKE	Yeah. Yeah. A lot of areas are really under-serviced with housing prices going up and rent. Average salary is staying the same. It's getting harder and harder for most people to make ends meet.

HARPER	And stores like yours make it easier for people to have a few more things they otherwise wouldn't?

LUKE	Yep.

HARPER	You're a really sweet guy, you know that?

LUKE	Oh, here comes the owner. And he looks grumpy, actually.

HARPER	Ah, excuse me, sir. I was just wondering if we could have a moment of your time?

BOBBY	My bouncer tells me you want my mistletoe?

HARPER	Well, technically it's my mistletoe.

BOBBY	Technically, I bought it from a fake Christmas tree stand two days ago.

BOUNCER	Fake Christmas tree stand?

BOBBY	Don't ask.

LUKE	Don't ask.

BOBBY	And if it's magic, why would I want to sell it?

HARPER	But my sister, she really needs it for this evening.

BOBBY	Listen, lady, it's the holidays. I'm really busy.

LUKE	Yeah. Yeah, wait. Hold on. We haven't even introduced ourselves. My name's Luke. Okay.

HARPER	I'm Harper.

BOBBY	Wait a minute. Meteorologist Harper Hart, Metro Channel 9 news.

HARPER	Ah, yes. That's me, Harper Hart.

BOBBY	I don't want to shake your hand.

LUKE	Oh.

HARPER	Oh. okay.

BOBBY	Come on. I'm your biggest fan.

HARPER	Really?

LUKE	Really?

BOUNCER	Really?

BOBBY	Really.

HARPER	Okay. I'm going to go in for a hug.

LUKE	Okay. Good luck. Oh.

BOBBY	No thanks.

BOUNCER	Look how happy Mr. West is.

LUKE	I never would have thought meteorologists have fans.

BOUNCER	You kiddin'? It's the only thing I've seen make him happy. The weather report. Who'd have thunk it? His wife died a few years back. So he quit his job, bought the bar, and just hides in the back all day. Maybe some of that mistletoe's magic will rub off on him?

LUKE	Well, it's been a pretty good streak so far. Actually, has anyone here fallen in love lately?

BOUNCER	Nah, not that I know of.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	Look, Mr. West—

BOBBY	Please call me Bobby.

HARPER	Bobby, thank you so much for letting me have this back. It means a lot to my family.

BOBBY	And you?

HARPER	Yeah, it means a lot to me as well.

LUKE	Are you sure we can't pay you back?

BOBBY	Don't even try, bud, I'll break your hand.

LUKE	Not trying.

BOBBY	I got a couple of autographs, a few dozen selfies, that ought to do.

HARPER	Well, I'm glad that we could do something for each other.

BOBBY	Are you kidding me? The guys in my chat room are gonna lose their minds when they hear about this.

LUKE	Wait, there are chat rooms for meteorologist fans?

HARPER	Oh, yeah.

BOBBY	You got a problem with that?

LUKE	No, sir. No.

BOBBY	It's a very interesting science.

LUKE	I will take your word for it.

BOBBY	No offense, Harper, but you can do better than this yutz.

HARPER	He's got his good points, trust me.

BOBBY	Well, you must have places to go. Cheer to spread.

LUKE	And magic.

BOBBY	It was a great Christmas present meeting you.

BOUNCER	This is beautiful.

BOBBY	Seeing as how it's Christmas Eve, I'm going to let this one slide.

LUKE	Thank you, sir.

BOBBY	No problem.

HARPER	Merry Christmas.

BOBBY	Merry Christmas.

LUKE	Merry Christmas.

HARPER	I can't believe we actually pulled this off.

LUKE	Oh. Out of all the people in the city to be meteorologist fans.

HARPER	Yeah. There's more than you think.

LUKE	Apparently.

HARPER 	Maybe you were right. Maybe Christmas miracles do exist. Maybe there is such a thing as a magic mistletoe.

LUKE	Oh, really? Now you're a believer?

HARPER	No. Well, maybe.

LUKE	You know what is strange, though. I was talking to the bouncer. He said no one in the bar has fallen in love there lately.

HARPER	Huh! So, it was all just a coincidence.

LUKE	Yeah, I really thought—

HARPER	Luke, I really wanna thank you for the last couple of days.

LUKE	Oh no, Harper, I—

HARPER	No, really, I do. Ever since running into you at the thrift store, it's just been this crazy adventure.

LUKE	I love adventures.

HARPER	And I couldn't have done it without you.

LUKE	Harper, I really want to say—

HARPER	Oh. I'm sorry, just a second.

LUKE	Hey. Everything okay?

HARPER	Ummm.... Not exactly. Brad…he's not coming to my Christmas dinner. He actually broke up with me.

LUKE	On Christmas Eve? Over text?

HARPER 	'Tis the season.

LUKE	[sighs] Harper, I'm so sorry.

HARPER 	Hey, you know what? It's okay. At least we got the mistletoe. My sister's going to be so happy.

LUKE	Yeah. Wait, didn't you-- didn't you say at the--the Christmas tree stand that your mistletoe is held together by green and red wires?

HARPER	Yeah. And a red ribbon.

LUKE	Well, this one-- hmm, just has a black wire. Here. Hmm?

HARPER	Oh no.

LUKE	Harper, ah....

HARPER	It's the wrong mistletoe.

LUKE	Look, the fake Christmas tree guy, he must've sold it to someone else. Look, it's not too far from here, and it's Christmas Eve. Maybe-- maybe it's still open?

HARPER 	No.

LUKE	If we run there, we can ask him if he sold it to somebody else, right?

HARPER 	No, Luke, it's over. It might not have even really started anyways.

LUKE	What?

HARPER	This whole thing has just been a waste of time. And you know, you even had me convinced for a moment that maybe--maybe there is such a thing as magic.

LUKE	No, no, no. Don't say that. You just told me how much fun you were having.

HARPER 	Yeah. Well, the adventure is over. And Christmas got me again. Let's hope this is close enough to fool my sister.

LUKE	No, don't do that.

HARPER	Well, that old plant never had any magic and neither does this one. You know, he's a great guy. They're gonna have a great marriage regardless of what mistletoe they kiss under tonight.

LUKE	We can just look a little harder, okay?

HARPER 	No, I'm done looking. And I'm done with whatever this was. And I'm definitely done with Christmas.

LUKE	Harper?

HARPER 	No, please, Luke. I just want to be alone.

LUKE	Nobody wants to be alone at Christmas.

HARPER 	I do.

LUKE	Bye, Harper.

HARPER 	No, no, no, no. Come on. Come on. Ohh! Why won't anyone believe me when I say I hate this holiday?

SANTA	I told you, you better watch out. Or you're going to end up on the naughty list.

HARPER 	Not in the mood.

SANTA	It looks like you found your mistletoe.

HARPER	Yeah. Well, no. It's a mistletoe, but it's not the right one.

SANTA	Well, that's too bad. I was hoping you would find it. A magic mistletoe is a rare thing.

HARPER 	Why do we keep running into each other?

SANTA	It's a small city.

HARPER 	No, it-- it's not, actually.

SANTA	Well, it's a small world then.

HARPER 	Is this all just an elaborate joke?

SANTA	What do you mean?

HARPER	Never mind. Wait, is this just some weird Christmas present that my family has put together to get me to fall in love with Christmas?

SANTA	Well, why would searching all over the city for missing mistletoe make you fall in love with Christmas again?

HARPER 	I don't know. Maybe making me spend time with an amazing guy who loves Christmas. And maybe I'll see the holidays through his eyes.

SANTA	You think your family has that kind of power? I don't even have that kind of power. What's his name?

HARPER	Luke.

SANTA	And what did you and Luke end up doing together?

HARPER 	We went to his aunt's house.

SANTA	Hmm-mm.

HARPER	And she had just fallen in love, and she was really happy to see her nephew twice in one week.

SANTA	Family is an important part of the holidays. What next?

HARPER 	And then we saw you.

SANTA	Hmm.

HARPER	And Ms. Claus made us wait in line to get a photo with you.

SANTA	A photo with a mall Santa. Something cherished by parents and families for a lifetime.

HARPER 	And then I had to get a present for Elle.

SANTA	Shopping on Christmas Eve. Sorry, kid, that must've been awful.

HARPER	No, it wasn't, actually. Luke made it fun. Actually, he made the entire time fun. And then we saw your friend at the fake Christmas tree stand.

SANTA	My buddy, Buddy. Pretty neat concept, huh?

HARPER 	And then at the bar, Mr. West was just so happy to talk about weather.

SANTA	Isn't that a great feeling? Making people happy? Maybe fulfilling somebody else's Christmas wish?

HARPER 	Hmm.

SANTA	You think maybe that's what Luke was doing?

HARPER	I just yelled at an amazing man who has done nothing but dedicate the last two days to---helping me find this.

SANTA	Seems like a nice kid. Although he did seem a little happy to see me at the mall. I mean, for a grown man and all.

HARPER	Yeah, he really does love Christmas.

SANTA	Maybe it's contagious.

HARPER	I have to go. I have so much to do before this night is over.

SANTA	Me too.

HARPER	Oh, I need a taxi.

SANTA	I'll handle it.

HARPER 	What? How?

SANTA	Merry Christmas, Harper.

HARPER	Merry Christmas, Santa.

ROBERT	Where to, miss?

HARPER	Robert?

ROBERT	Hey, it's you. Did you and Luke find the magic mistletoe?

HARPER	No, we didn't. But that's okay because I think Santa pointed out I may have found something much, much better.

ROBERT	Santa?

HARPER	Yeah, he's right ov--Wait, he was here just a moment ago.

ROBERT	Well, it is Christmas Eve. I'm sure he had places to be. So where to?

HARPER	I have to go to the suburbs. Can you get me there fast?

ROBERT	Buckle up, little lady.

SONG	“Winter flows Confetti and December sky While the stars Twinkle like Christmas lights Jack Frost turned The skating pond to ice And snow covers the canvas Tonight I see the picture Ain't it so clear But I don't feel The white Christmas this year I know green is the color Of holly and vine Red like the sidewalk Santa outside But everywhere I look There's nothing but blue  (vocalizing) That's the color Of Christmas Without you”

LUKE	Hi, you've reached Luke. Leave a message at the beep.

HARPER	Luke, it's Harper. I want to say I'm sorry. I hate what I said back at the car. I didn't mean it, and I-- I take it all back. I think you made me fall back in love with Christmas. And…I think you made me fall in love with you.

MRS. HART	Harper, you made it.

MR. HART	Well, that's perfect timing.

HOLLY	Harper, you made it.

HARPER	Hmm.

HOLLY	Oh, we were getting worried.

HARPER	Holly, I have to talk to you about something.

HOLLY	Oh my gosh! The mistletoe. You remembered.

HARPER	I don't know how to tell you this. I lost the family mistletoe.

HOLLY	No, you didn't. It's right there.

HARPER 	No, this one just looks like ours, but it's not. And I know how much it meant to you and the family and I know you were wanting to have it because you were hoping Mark was going to propose. And it's tradition.

HOLLY	Harp, it's okay.

HARPER	Oh, my gosh! Oh, congratulations.

HOLLY	Thank you. See, we didn't need the mistletoe after all. We made our own magic.

HARPER	I'm so happy for you two. You did good, Mark.

MARK	Thank you.

HOLLY	Yeah, I'll keep him around a while. Oh hey, where is your boyfriend?

HARPER	Oh, Luke?

HOLLY	Ah, I was talking about Brad.

HARPER	Hmm.

HOLLY	Who's Luke? 

HARPER	Sorry. It's just been a crazy couple of days. Brad and I actually broke up.

HOLLY	Oh, but he had a Christmas present delivered to the house yesterday.

MARK	I'll go get it for you.

HARPER	Yeah, we broke up like an hour ago.

HOLLY	Oh.

HARPER	Okay. Oh, he even wrapped it. Hmm.

HOLLY	A coffee maker? But you hate coffee.

HARPER	Hmm-mm.

MARK	It's Coffee 2000. Look, I hear these are great.

HARPER	Consider it an engagement gift.

MARK	Thank you. Awesome. Hmm.

HOLLY	So, who's this Luke guy? Come in.

LUKE	Harper?

HARPER	Luke? Luke, I'm so sorry about the awful things that I said to you.

LUKE	Don't worry about it.

HARPER	No. These past two days with you have been amazing.

MARK	What's going on?

HOLLY	I have no idea.

HARPER	Running around town hunting for the mistletoe, we did everything that most people do during the holidays.

LUKE	Hmm.

HARPER	We even went to a Christmas tree stand.

LUKE	Well, a fake Christmas tree stand.

HARPER	Which I loved.

LUKE	Really?

MARK	I hate fake Christmas trees.

HOLLY	Shh-shh-shh.

LUKE	Harper, I have to tell you something.

HARPER	No, wait. The thing is, we did everything that I usually hate about Christmas. But this time I loved it. And it's because I did all of it with you. So, it doesn't matter that we didn't find the mistletoe.

MR. HART	She lost the magic mistletoe?

HOLLY	Shh.

LUKE	Harper. Umm....

HARPER	Our mistletoe?

LUKE	Yeah.

MR. HART	Oh, thank goodness.

MRS. HART	Oh.

HARPER	But, how?

LUKE	Well, I went back to the fake Christmas tree stand. The two sales kids there were closing shop and I asked them about it, and it was hanging out back. They were kissing under it during their breaks.

HARPER	I can't believe you went back for it.

LUKE	What do you mean? It was a Christmas emergency.

HARPER	No, it was more than that. It was magic.

LUKE	Magic. Oh...

MR. HART	I'm confused. That doesn't look like Brad from the news.

MRS. HART	Hmm-mm.

HOLLY	His name is Luke.

MRS. HART	Is that Mary's boy, Lucas?

HOLLY	No, Mom. That kid was chubby.

MRS. HART	Not anymore. He lost that weight years ago. I think he runs a thrift store now.

HOLLY	Why would you know that?

MRS. HART	We're friends online.

HOLLY	Of course she is.

MR. HART	Okay, enough of this kissing. Let's eat.

HARPER	Do you want to join me and my family for Christmas Eve dinner?

LUKE	I'd love to.

SONG	“Under the mistletoe  You give a kiss And it brings a smile We see it and We talk by the fire At Christmas time There we find There’s a glow In the frosted window And we see the lights It'll soon be time For Christmas It's everywhere It'll soon be time For Christmas Why won’t yous how the world You care At Christmas time The wonderful time of year A time for love A time to share And somebody's all alone “

SANTA	And so, another Christmas comes, and you may ask yourself, is it all just ice crystals in the upper clouds and probability theory? Or is it magic? Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

SONG	“It'll soon be time For Christmas It's in the air It'll soon be time For Christmas Won't you show the world You care At Christmas time Let's build a world Where love is Christmas The celebration is for All to share It'll soon be time For Christmas Time we all can share It'll soon be time For Christmas It's everywhere It'll soon be time For Christmas Won't you show the world You care At Christmas time Christmas time  It's Christmas time Show the world you care Christmas time Frosty has his top hat Rudolph his red nose Santa's got a reindeer To keep that sleigh afloat Oh I may not have any magic But baby please don't go Come it's Christmas Eve  Let's you and me Find some mistletoe A Christmas kiss From your sweet lips No wrapping paper Can contain the joy You bring to me Hmm it's snowing On the sidewalk Got a fire Burning strong So get up your shoes Bring those baby blues We're dancing all night long  I'll pop some Sparkling (indistinct) Make a toast to love Don't need that tree Lit up to see It's you I'm dreaming of A Christmas kiss From your sweet lips Is the only gift I need”
