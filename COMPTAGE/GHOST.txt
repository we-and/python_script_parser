SOLDIER 1	Hey, get down! 

SOLDIER 2	Hey, get back! Get back! 

SOLDIER 3	[indistinct]. [men screaming] 

SOLDIER 1	[indistinct] they're everywhere! 

SOLDIER 2	[indistinct]. 

SOLDIER 1	They're coming! 

CHRIS	What do you want? [breathes heavily]

KIRK	Hey Butchie, you got an extra pair of them socks?

KIRK	These dogs is itchin' me like crazy. 

BUTCHIE	Shoulda packed two pair.

KIRK	I did. Put holes in the first pair after three days. Damn it. [chuckles] I wish I was born flat foot.

KIRK	My cousin's kid brother got flat feet.

KIRK	When he found out he couldn't get into the army,

KIRK	he hung himself in my uncle's barn.

EUGENE	You're so full of shit, Kirk.

EUGENE	Your cousin's kid brother still your cousin, ain't he?

EUGENE	Why would you call him anything else?

KIRK	No kidding. He's my cousin. 

EUGENE	Who would lie about that?

EUGENE	Do you even know why you lie?

KIRK	Who you cracking wise at?

CHRIS	[exhales] The outpost is 30 miles over those hills.

CHRIS	Let's move out.

CHRIS	Feel a Jeep coming. How many M7's we got? [Jeep engine revving]

EUGENE	Maybe we should've spared that Jeep.

EUGENE	Still a long way to walk. 

CHRIS	Yeah because it worked out so well for them.

TAPPERT	Nazis ain't so tough now, are you?

TAPPERT	Hmm. 

TAPPERT	You ain't going to be needing this. No. 

CHRIS	Hey Butchie, keep your eyes out for any maps, coded messages, anything we can use against these guys. 

BUTCHIE	What do you think I'm doing?

KIRK	Hey Butchie, we got a live one.

KIRK	You want, I should reel him in or throw him back?

BUTCHIE	He's a major. 

BUTCHIE	That'll do. Let's go, Jerry, put up your dukes.

TAPPERT	When yo' smiling Oh when yo' smiling §

TAPPERT	The whole world Smiles with you§

BUTCHIE	Huh? Huh?

EUGENE	Mein Freund will dich boxen.

BUTCHIE	Shut up, Eugene.

BUTCHIE	This Kraut fuck knows exactly what I'm saying. Huh?

MAJOR	Stoppen sie diesen wahnsinn!

BUTCHIE	Eh?

BUTCHIE	Or Eh?

BUTCHIE	Eh? Or Eh?

MAJOR	Yeah.

KIRK	Hey, look at Rocky Graciano!

BUTCHIE	Mother Mary, this guy is good.

CHRIS	Nearest crossing now is two miles over [indistinct].

KIRK	Go get him, Butchie. 

EUGENE	Yup. 

KIRK	Come on, you swing like a dame.

CHRIS	Sorry, guys, we're way behind. I think I made a wrong turn. Pack up.

TAPPERT	Guten menschen.

TAPPERT	Okay.

KIRK	Feels like my feet are going to fall off. 

CHRIS	Once we get there, it'll be cake.

CHRIS	You guys can sleep for days. 

BUTCHIE	Who we babysitting this time? 

CHRIS	Not a who. A mansion. Or castle. Supposed to be a big deal when the 82nd Airborne came through and pushed out the Nazi high-command. We're to hold it until our relief comes. 

BUTCHIE	How long is that? 

CHRIS	As long as it takes. 

EUGENE	Yowsa, yowsa, yowsa. Clean sheets and toilet paper. 

EUGENE	No wonder the Nazis commandeered it. 

TAPPERT	Yeah.

TAPPERT	What's not to love?

EUGENE	Maybe he's just sleeping?

BUTCHIE	Yeah, not enough rooms.

CHRIS	Easy, Lou. Your relief is here.

EUGENE	You fall asleep stargazing or something?

MORGAN	Major Gibb, our relief is here!

EUGENE	I think I died and gone to heaven, boys. 

CHRIS	Man, are you kidding me? Look at this. This place is as big as Roselands. 

TAPPERT	It's bigger than my whole neighborhood in Queens. 
GIBB	Okay, gear up, and fall in. We're out in two minutes.

SOLDIER	Wow. 

CHRIS	What's the hurry?

GIBB	There's no hurry. 

TAPPERT	Why aren't y'all sleeping in the beds?

TAPPERT	They got bedbugs or something?

PRIVATE 1	Yeah, bedbugs.

PRIVATE 1	We put most of the mattresses in the basement. 

TAPPERT	Hmm.

KIRK TO PRIVATE 2	What's the story, morning glory?

KIRK TO PRIVATE 2	Any news on that thing?

PRIVATE 2	No, uh... it doesn't pick up much out here. Must be broken.

BUTCHIE	Broken huh? Maybe you should leave it with us?

BUTCHIE	Eugene there's a regular Marconi with a screwdriver.

PRIVATE 2	Yeah.

PRIVATE 2	Yeah.

PRIVATE 2	Can I go now? 

KIRK	Not yet.

KIRK	Where's the grub? 

MORGAN	When this place was a Kraut base for operations,

MORGAN	they stacked the pantry full of sausage, cheeses, wine and all the brandy you can drink.

MORGAN	Supply truck comes through to re-up in a week.

MORGAN	They'll have fresh bread and K-rations. 

CHRIS	So what's wrong with the joint?

MORGAN	I mean, if this place is like Coney Island, what's the rush?

MORGAN	You're a day late. We're behind schedule and some of us would like to make furlough, okay, asshole?

MORGAN	Let's move.

EUGENE	One of them left their rucksack behind. 

BUTCHIE	What do you mean, you never had fondue? Were you raised in a brothel?

EUGENE	Give him pots and pans and he's little Lord Fauntleroy.

BUTCHIE	Hey, how far is the nearest cathouse, anyway?

BUTCHIE	Heard the French girls are cut sideways.

TAPPERT	It's Jap girls that are cut sideways you ding-a-ling.

BUTCHIE	Don't see why we should all be on lockdown.

BUTCHIE	We could be here all week. 

CHRIS	I'm going to take a look around the house.

KIRK	A bit of fondue.

BUTCHIE	Eugene! 
BUTCHIE	The cheese!

BUTCHIE	Boo! 

BUTCHIE	This is the life, boys.

EUGENE	What?

TAPPERT	Is it any good?

EUGENE	Oh, yeah. It's about a machine that's supposed to be a mental portal between dimensions,

EUGENE	but it turns out it's also a portal between times.

TAPPERT	You coulda just said "no".

KIRK	Break's over.

KIRK	What the hell is that? 

CHRIS	What the fuck? 

KIRK	Three, two, one. 

CHRIS	The hell was that?

KIRK	You saw it too? 

CHRIS	Not sure what I saw.

EUGENE	Earl Grey?

KIRK	It's true.

KIRK	My cousin's letter says they're treating us POWs well.

KIRK	The food ain't so bad, and we get to play baseball all day.

KIRK	I love you, and I can't wait to see you after the war.

KIRK	And then at the bottom of the letter, he writes,

KIRK	PS. Save the stamp for Uncle Harold.

KIRK	Except there is no Uncle Harold in the family.

KIRK	So me and Alice steams off the stamp all curious, you know?

KIRK	And underneath written in small letters, five words,

KIRK	"They've cut out my tongue."

BUTCHIE	God.

BUTCHIE	What's that?

EUGENE	Ah, I found it in the basement. Belonged to one of the Nazis who took over the house.

EUGENE	Dieter Werner, 18 years old.

BUTCHIE	Nazi shithead.

BUTCHIE	You guys remember Louie from Bravo company? The ginger from the pig farm?

BUTCHIE	How that old whore stole his money roll and locked herself in the bathroom? 

TAPPERT	What about her? 

BUTCHIE	He hears glass breaking. She starts screaming bloody murder.

BUTCHIE	So he starts poundin' on the door trying to break in,

BUTCHIE	but the door is solid.

BUTCHIE	After a couple of minutes, he gets through.

BUTCHIE	Sees a broken window.

BUTCHIE	The woman's ear in the sink,

BUTCHIE	and written in the vanity in lipstick,

BUTCHIE	"Welcome to the wonderful world of the clap."

EUGENE	You're so full of shit, Butchie.

CHRIS	You hear that?

KIRK	I hope it doesn't do that all night. I might have to sleep outside.

TAPPERT	It's cool you can read Kraut. 

EUGENE	Yeah.

EUGENE	I can see why they left it behind.

EUGENE	It says what happens to the family who lived here,

EUGENE	and what he did to them. 

CHRIS	Guys, I think I'm going cuckoo.

CHRIS	Is that Morse code?

EUGENE	I.H.A.V.E.N.O--

BUTCHIE	Bullshit.

EUGENE	L.E.G. 

EUGENE	S.

KIRK	"I have no legs"? 

EUGENE	Sh! 

BUTCHIE	Jesus.

TAPPERT	Hmm. 

EUGENE	Ah.

KIRK	Get rid of that. It's covered in disease.

TAPPERT	Who you're supposed to be? My mama?

EUGENE	Stop.

BUTCHIE	That was bullshit, right?

CHRIS	Tappert, take the attic tonight. Best vantage points if there's any conflict.

TAPPERT	Yeah. 

CHRIS	We can all sleep in a bed tonight, but stay within shouting distance till we know what the fuck's happening.

EUGENE	Come on. Open up.

EUGENE	Shit.

EUGENE	Shit. 

CHRIS	So, anyone wanna talk about last night?

KIRK	Those boys seemed like they wanted out in a hurry. 

EUGENE	Ever find out whose rucksack that was? 

CHRIS	Tappert's going through it.

KIRK	Think he'll find any gold teeth? 

EUGENE	He gives me the shivers. I mean, after Paris... 

KIRK	Drop it, Eug. 

EUGENE	You didn't find him sitting in a pool of blood. Six or seven 15-year-olds all carved up. 

KIRK	Hitler youth. 

EUGENE	Guts all on the floor.

EUGENE	And he's sittin' there, you know, with that look he gets.

EUGENE	That weird smile. And tellin' me they were smuggling diamonds. 

CHRIS	He show you any diamonds? 

EUGENE	What do you think?

EUGENE	I never told you guys this part. He holds up his hands...

EUGENE	and he's got string around his fingers.

EUGENE	You know a cat's cradle? And he just goes...

EUGENE	"Your move".

EUGENE	All dreamily.

KIRK	Okay. That's a little eggy. 

EUGENE	Yeah, well, one last thing

EUGENE	to pull your coat to; it wasn't the first move.

EUGENE	You know, like a cat's cradle, the first ten moves are easy, and then it gets hard.

EUGENE	So who helped him get to move five

EUGENE	in a room full of dead kids?

CHRIS	Glad he's on our side. 

TAPPERT	I think I figured out what put the bee in the bonnets in the last squad that was here.

TAPPERT	Radio said there's a German line coming through from Nuremberg,

TAPPERT	to some kind of camp inin Strasbourg.

TAPPERT	There's some trucks, maybe a couple of dozen Jerrys on foot.

EUGENE	Shit.

TAPPERT	Look I say, we gear up,

TAPPERT	head into those woods and wait for them to pass.

TAPPERT	We stay here, we're fish in a barrel.

CHRIS	We can't leave.

TAPPERT	Five guys against fifty, is plain suicide.

CHRIS	We're stayin'.

TAPPERT	Great.

TAPPERT	Okay, well then, I guess I'll just go up to the attic

TAPPERT	and try to spot the men. Any of you want to maybe come help?

TAPPERT	Eugene?

TAPPERT	Come on.

TAPPERT	We can play cat's cradle.

TAPPERT	Like talking about people when they're not around? 

EUGENE	What?

TAPPERT	What the hell is that?

EUGENE	Black magic.

EUGENE	Sacrificial altars.

EUGENE	They say Hitler's a big believer in the Occult.

TAPPERT	They say, huh?

EUGENE	The Nazis must've committed ritualistic killings on the Helwigs.

TAPPERT	Sick pups.

EUGENE	Hey, gimme a hand, will you?

TAPPERT	Going take it over there. 

EUGENE	Yeah, okay.

EUGENE	Got it. I got it.

TAPPERT	Ready? 

EUGENE	Hmm-mm.

TAPPERT	One...

EUGENE	Ah! [screaming] You motherfucker!

TAPPERT	You know it wasn't me.

EUGENE	Ah! Get away from me!

EUGENE	God. Ah! [moaning in pain]

EUGENE	Hear that?

KIRK	What is that? 

EUGENE	Wait.

CHRIS	I don't believe in witches,

CHRIS	but if an old hag flies around on a broomstick...

EUGENE	Please tell me we're having this conversation right now?

KIRK	I thought I was batshit.

EUGENE	Yeah, me too. Now I know why the last bunch was so desperate to am-scray.

EUGENE	I mean, this place is--

CHRIS	Haunted...

CHRIS	Unless someone's got a better word for it?

KIRK	Look, before the Nazis come, we should like, 23 skidoo.

KIRK	What is that? 

EUGENE	Ssshh...

EUGENE	I.F.

EUGENE	Y.O.U.

EUGENE	L.E.A.V.E.

EUGENE	If you leave...

KIRK	What the fuck is happening?

EUGENE	I'm not writing! I'm not writing! Ah!

KIRK	Fuck!

DEMONIC VOICE	If you leave... you die!

TAPPERT	What?

KIRK	It'd be nice if someone left something in these we could actually use. 

CHRIS	Then we go padlock the front door and make them think that we abandoned the place. They come in looking for food... [cocks gun] not our first rodeo. 

EUGENE	Wait, they're moving on. They're moving on.

EUGENE	Dammit. 

BUTCHIE	That son of a bitch.

EUGENE	Grenade!

EUGENE	Butchie, no!

CHRIS	Eugene! 

EUGENE	Chris. 

CHRIS	Kirk! 

KIRK	Chris!

MAN	Down here! Move!

CHRIS	Oh shit. Oh fuck. Shit.

CHRIS	Eugene!

EUGENE	Oh! 

EUGENE	This isn't real. This isn't real. [exhales]

KIRK	Always got to be the hero. 

CHRIS	How much morphine we have left? 

EUGENE	Enough do the job. If we have to. 

CHRIS	Take this trash out with the rest of 'em.

EUGENE	The hell did you do?

TAPPERT	You wouldn't understand it.

APPERT	Strip him down and put him with the rest.

CHRIS	What the hell does "haunted" even mean?

CHRIS	Does that mean specific people have ghosts that are somehow anchored to the places they died?

CHRIS	Or is that the places where evils occurred that makes the portal to demonic forces?

CHRIS	Or is evil simply a man-made concept in the first place? 

TAPPERT	Will you give it a rest already?

TAPPERT	Look, evil is just well, it's what makes the violence so much fun.

EUGENE	Everything we experienced, it's what the Nazis did to the family that lived here.

EUGENE	The Helwigs, despite their French royal lineage, were hiding Jews.

EUGENE	So the house fell into Nazi hands.

EUGENE	And when the Nazis finally came, they smashed the doors down

EUGENE	and the children ran and hid.

EUGENE	But, Mr. Helwig was found right here in the library. So the Nazis tied him to a chair.

EUGENE	Mrs. Helwig was hiding in the kitchen pantry,

EUGENE	so they dragged her upstairs

EUGENE	where they found her son hiding in the armoire in the attic.

EUGENE	They drowned her boy in the upstairs bathtub

EUGENE	and forced her to watch at gunpoint.

EUGENE	They found the daughter hiding in the servants' quarters,

EUGENE	Cristina. So they dragged her upstairs to the attic. 

EUGENE	And hanged her from the rafters.

EUGENE	They carried the screaming mom down to the library

EUGENE	where they had soaked her husband in kerosene,

EUGENE	laughing as they set him on fire.

EUGENE	They tossed their bodies in a heap.

EUGENE	No funerals, no headstones.

CHRIS	Is that why they're, you know, still here? No Christian burial, that sorta thing?

CHRIS	Wandering the earth with unfinished business?

EUGENE	I'm gonna go check on Butchie.

EUGENE	Ssh. 

EUGENE	Ssh. 

TAPPERT	Put it away.

TAPPERT	My father was a milkman. My mother was my den mother in elementary.

TAPPERT	I always had a thing for scary movies, you know?

TAPPERT	Abbott and Costello Meet The Mummy. I was a teenage werewolf. Waskids' stuff. [exhales] Scarier the better. After Normandy... I've seen anddone things...

TAPPERT	Hmm.

TAPPERT	Did I ever tell you how I didn't sleep for five days when I marched to Stuttgart?

TAPPERT	Five days. They say it's not possible without losing your mind.

TAPPERT	I couldn't tell if I was dreaming or awake after three.

TAPPERT	And in my more lucid moments, I wondered if I was ever going to get back to normal again.

TAPPERT	[whispers] What I did to those Hitler Youth kids was a fucking nightmare.

TAPPERT	A nightmare I got to control.

TAPPERT	I wanted to kill the eggs before they hatched.

TAPPERT	I was like floating above my body

TAPPERT	looking down on myself, when I cut that little blonde boy's head off.

TAPPERT	It was like I wasn't doing it at all.

TAPPERT	Fucking that I remember just...

TAPPERT	watching myself sitting there when that--that body just got up off the ground.

TAPPERT	Total insanity. Fever dream.

TAPPERT	And then he pulled a piece of string out of his pocket,

TAPPERT	that body without a head and-and he held his hands out.

TAPPERT	And he-he made a cat's cradle, and-and what am I going to do?

TAPPERT	I just cut his fuckin' head off. Am I gonna be rude? 

TAPPERT	So I played with him for a while. And then he just... laid back down.

TAPPERT	I'm pretty-pretty sure it was a-it was a dream.

TAPPERT	But I was just, I was just too scared to move. So I sat there, holding that cat's cradle for hours until you came and you found me with the bodies.

TAPPERT	I completely forgot that that ever happened.

EUGENE	And yesterday, I reminded you? 

TAPPERT	Yeah. Hmm. [sniffs] [door creaks]

CHRIS	Kirk! You forgot to drain the tub!

CHRIS	I'm here to help you.

EUGENE	Chr-Chr-Chris!

EUGENE	Wake up! Wake up! Chris! Hey--

EUGENE	It's another dream, man.

CHRIS	Ah. 

EUGENE	Hmm.

KIRK	How much longer can he go without food?

EUGENE	Ah, don't know.

EUGENE	So, what are we going to do, Chris? No one wants to stay here another night.

KIRK	We'll be court-martialed for deserting our post. Hey, Tap, you think you could find that Nazi truck again

KIRK	if you had to?

TAPPERT	I mean, it wouldn't matter. I slashed the tires.

KIRK	Fuck.

CHRIS	Maybe our relief will come soon.

EUGENE	All right, Butch. The next bit is about quantum entanglement, dulls-ville, 

TAPPERT	and then the Martian visitor explains that the deeds 

EUGENE	from one life are carried with you into the next. So, reincarnation for Martians... 

CHRIS	What are we looking for anyway? 

EUGENE	I don't know. Memoirs, diaries... anything that really belonged to the Helwigs.

EUGENE	Ah, fuck a duck. 

CHRIS	You got your Zippo? 

EUGENE	Yeah, upstairs.

EUGENE	Studying German?

CHRIS	You sure there isn't anything you want to tell me?

MRS. HELWIG	...Vetrulek...

KIRK	Is anyone down there? 

CHRIS	What's up? 

KIRK	Get your asses up here now.

BUTCHIE	This isn't real. This isn't real.

BUTCHIE	This isn't real, this isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. 

KIRK	Where's the damn morphine? 

BUTCHIE	This isn't real. This isn't real. 

KIRK	Eugene! The morphine! 

EUGENE	Ah! It's in the medical kit. 

BUTCHIE	This isn't real, this isn't real.

BUTCHIE	It was us. It was us. It was us. It was us.

BUTCHIE	It was us. It was us. It was us. 

CHRIS	What was us? Butchie, what was us?

BUTCHIE	Remember. 

KIRK	Come downstairs.

KIRK	We need to talk.

KIRK	We're not staying another night. 

EUGENE	Not saying we abandon post, but maybe take a new position in the woods or something. 

TAPPERT	Just frankly, my dear, fuck the court-martial. This place is bad juju. 

CHRIS	I think we should give them a proper burial. 

EUGENE	Oh. 

CHRIS	Send them off to heaven. 

KIRK	Or the other place.

CHRIS	Does the journal say where the bodies are dumped? Let me see the journal.

CHRIS	I don't understand. 

EUGENE	No kidding. It's in German.

EUGENE	You can barely order champagne in Paris.

CHRIS	Does Dieter say where they put the bodies? 

EUGENE	I'll check, okay?

EUGENE	But right now, let's get out of this house. 

CHRIS	And you're all willing to die in a military prison? 

KIRK	Yes.

CHRIS	I want everyone geared up and ready to clear out. Double time.

EUGENE	All right. Better get our stories straight before we hit a base camp. Like, the German soldiers burned the castle down. 

TAPPERT	That story ain't gonna seem so straight when they find the place in one piece. 

KIRK	Maybe we shoulda torched it. 

CHRIS	Maybe it wouldn't let us.

EUGENE	Do we keep going?

CHRIS	We could, uh, flip a coin, I guess.

CHRIS	You guys ever read "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge?" 

KIRK	The one where the entire story takes place in the mind of a guy hanging from a noose?

TAPPERT	If we're dead, heaven fucking sucks.

EUGENE	Unless it's the other place. Well, that's what they say, right? Hell is repetition. You know, most cultures have a version of hell

EUGENE	where the dead relive their sins over and over for eternity.

EUGENE	Just trapped in a loop.

TAPPERT	This ain't right, man. 

KIRK	Let's just turn around.

KIRK	I just realized...

KIRK	I haven't taken a shit since I can remember.

TAPPERT	That's a classic pick-up line.

CHRIS	Neither have I. For like weeks. That's not possible, right?

EUGENE	No, it's not. 

CHRIS	Situation Normal All Fucked Up.

EUGENE	SNAFU alright.

EUGENE	Okay. I'm just going to say what we're all thinking.

EUGENE	If we march tomorrow, and return... 

CHRIS	One day at a time.

CHRIS	Like the drunks say.

CRISTINA'S VOICE	...Vetrulek... 

TAPPERT	This ain't right, man. 

KIRK	Let's just turn around.

KIRK	Maybe the compass is broken.

TAPPERT	Yeah, the map too. 

CHRIS	It won't let us leave. 

KIRK	What if... what if we gave 'em a proper burial and all, like you said? 

CHRIS	Did the journal "20" the body dump?

EUGENE	The last page was missing.

CHRIS	We need to communicate with the spirits. Find out where their remains are. 

KIRK	By baking them a cake? 

CHRIS	Footsteps. I want to see where they go.

TAPPERT	Vetrulek... 

EUGENE	Where did you hear that word?

TAPPERT	Hmm?

EUGENE	Vetrulek.

TAPPERT	It's just something that's been...

TAPPERT	floating around in my head.

KIRK	Triple word score on that one.

EUGENE	You know, Dieter mentions that word. It's an old Muslim belief.

EUGENE	"If you let evil happen,

EUGENE	it could come back to haunt you tenfold." 

KIRK	Like "All that's required for evil to triumphis good men do nothing"?

EUGENE	Yeah, but more like a curse.

CHRIS	Why would Tappert know that word?

CHRIS	What do you want?

CHRIS	Guys, guys, help! Shoot her!

CHRIS	Fucking shoot her!!

EUGENE	Shoot it!

TAPPERT	Shoot what?

CHRIS	Shoot her! Fucking shoot her!

EUGENE	Flank left!

EUGENE	Chris, we're coming in! One, two three! 

CHRIS	They're here.

KIRK	What is it? 

EUGENE	It's the last page of the journal.

KIRK	Done. We should pray or something.

EUGENE	This makes no sense.

CHRIS	What? 

EUGENE	The Helwigs weren't French; they were Afghans.

EUGENE	This family, they hid dozens of Jews in the walls here

EUGENE	and spent a fortune providing them safe passage to America.

EUGENE	They risked their lives collaborating against the Nazis

EUGENE	for as long as they could.

KIRK	Since when do you know Arabic?

CHRIS	What else does it say?

EUGENE	Just before she died, Mrs. Helwig performed the vetrulek curse against the men who just stood by and watched.

EUGENE	Just haunting them to the grave.

KIRK	Could we just focus on one fucking thing for two seconds?

KIRK	Let's finish it.

KIRK	Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

KIRK	As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

KIRK	I will fear no evil.

KIRK	Court-martial, my ass, for all I care. 

KIRK	As long as it's not here. 

CHRIS	Amen to that. 

KIRK	Hey! Give me a hand with this.

KIRK	Oh! Slowly. Could be booby-trapped.

KIRK	Cigars!

CHRIS	Locked in a trunk? Gotta be worth something.

KIRK	Whatever. Let's clear out in five. 

EUGENE	Hold on a second.

EUGENE	Peter mentioned something about a trunk in his last entry. And once the Nazis opened it, his entries stopped.

CHRIS	What now?

EUGENE	It's like some of the words are different.

EUGENE	Like it says something new.

CHRIS	What?

EUGENE	That interring them only gave them power. 

KIRK	Power for what?

EUGENE	Power to bring them back from the dead.

CHRIS	Break's over.

BUTCHIE	This isn't real! This isn't real!

BUTCHIE	This isn't real!

CHRIS	Get off of me!

CRISTINA	Remembeeeeeer...

BUTCHIE	Remembeeeeeer...

BUTCHIE	This isn't real! This isn't real!

BUTCHIE	This isn't real!

HISHAM	Remembeeeeeer...

GERMAN MAJOR	Easy, son. Take it easy.

NURSE	It's alright. Relax.

GERMAN MAJOR	Hold him down.

GERMAN MAJOR	Easy.

CHRIS	Get away!

GERMAN MAJOR	Back up, back up!

GERMAN MAJOR	Lieutenant Goodson! You stand down!

GERMAN MAJOR	Stand down, son. Son, son!

GERMAN MAJOR	Before you hurt someone, give me that.

DR. ENGEL	And you pull them out,

DR. ENGEL	I don't want them going under like that again.

DR. ENGEL	Don't worry if you can't remember anything. 

DR. ENGEL	That will pass shortly.

CHRIS	Where am I?

DR. ENGEL	You were flown to a special off-book facility. Do you remember your last day in Afghanistan, Lieutenant?

DR. ENGEL	Give it a sec. It'll come to you.

CHRIS	Let's move!

CHRIS	What's the situation? 

ECHO 11	The asset's the blue-chip doctor for Islamic State's top brass. 

CHRIS	Cooperating? 

ECHO 11	Yeah. Fed us site intel on the last four high-value kills. Put his entire family at risk to help us. But he's been blown. Go for CENTCOM. So it's an extraction? The plan is to get his family to a safe house in Kabul, but, there goes our information pipeline. 

EUGENE	Copy that.

DR. ENGEL	The injuries to your squad were extreme.

DR. ENGEL	And they were far too critical for the Kandahar Trauma Center.

DR. ENGEL	The mind is a very powerful healing tool, but when depressed by the awareness of paralysis

DR. ENGEL	and amputation, it can simply shut down and die.

DR. ENGEL	Our computer simulation is designed to help soldiers

DR. ENGEL	recover from their post traumatic stress

DR. ENGEL	as they heal from their injuries. 

CHRIS	Where's Butchie?

CHRIS	Why can't I remember?

DR. ENGEL	I'm sorry. It's not supposed to happen like this.

CHRIS	Like what?

TAPPERT	Okay.

TAPPERT	Playing Cat's Cradle, huh?

TAPPERT	You see this? I was going to give this to my boy. Do you want it?

TAPPERT	Here's a tag. Get out of here. You want it?

TAPPERT	There.

MR. HELWIG	Hey, Paul!

ECHO 11	As-Salaam-Alaikum. 

MRS. HELWIG	Wa-As-Salaam-Alaikum, Paul. Please join us.

VOICE OVER RADIO	Echo-11, your window is closing. 

ECHO 11	Doctor.

CHRIS	Is this everyone? Yellow Six, standby with a van.

MRS. HELWIG	What's wrong? 
ECHO 11	That day we hoped would never come.

ECHO 11	Your name keeps coming up in the cyber chatter.

MRS. HELWIG	Why? What happened?

MRS. HELWIG	You promised to protect us. 

ECHO 11	I know, and I'm sorry, but look--

ECHO 11	you don't even have time to pack.

ECHO 11	Just get your children, get your passports,

ECHO 11	and meet us outside in two minutes.

ECHO 11	Let's move. 

VOICE OVER RADIO	Echo 11, Abort mission.

VOICE OVER RADIO	We've got three incoming land bogies

VOICE OVER RADIO	cutting off all major arteries.

VOICE OVER RADIO	You've got about 30 seconds to find cover.

ECHO 11	Command jacked into a NATO satellite. ISIS forces are coming in from all sides.

ECHO 11	Three vehicles.

ECHO 11	Put us in the wall.

MRS. HELWIG	What? 

ECHO 11	ISIS is coming and they're blocking our escape.

ECHO 11	Put us in the wall.

MR. HELWIG	Hide! Come please, please. This way. Here, here.

MR. HELWIG	Christina!

ECHO 11	Inside!

EUGENE	Keep dreaming, man.

ECHO 11	Extraction is now impossible. We wait for the Hajis, and let the drones track them back to the big brass.

ECHO 11	CDE can put eyes overhead in five. Move! 

CHRIS	Fuck that! I'm not going in there.

ECHO 11	You don't have a goddamn opinion until I give you one! 

EUGENE	What about protecting the family?

ECHO 11	Get in the fucking wall!

ECHO 11	NOW! 

CHRIS	Fuck.

MR. HELWIG	Come on. Come on.

MR. HELWIG	You have to hide. Come on!

MR. HELWIG	Get in! Go!

CHRIS	Shh.

ISIS LEADER	As-Salaam-Alaikum. 

MR. HELWIG	As-Salaam-Alaikum. Please join us, won't you?

ISIS LEADER	Thank you. What a lovely idea.

MR. HELWIG	Please. Sit.Thank you.

ISIS LEADER	Four times you've examined a member of the Shura Council, and four times they've been executed in a drone strike.

ISIS LEADER	Please help me understand this mystery.

MR. HELWIG	I swear I've said nothing to anyone.

MR. HELWIG	I didn't talk to anyone.

ISIS LEADERY	et we have so many glowing reports about you. The rare medicines you provide.

MR. HELWIG	I scrounge what I can from the nearby clinics.

ISIS LEADER	That's a relief, because someone suspicious might think

ISIS LEADER	you were receiving medicine from the Americans in exchange for information perhaps.

MR. HELWIG	No, no.

ISIS LEADER	Grab the kids.

MR. HELWIG	No, for God's sake!

MRS. HELWIG	Let them go!

MRS. HELWIG	Let them go!

MRS. HELWIG	They've done nothing wrong!

MR. HELWIG	No! I swear to God. I'm not stupid.

MR. HELWIG	I wouldn't put my family in danger!

CRISTINA	Leave my father alone.

MR. HELWIG	Hey! Hey!

EUGENE	You're done.

MRS. HELWIG	You will pay for this!

MRS. HELWIG	You will all suffer unimaginably! 

ECHO 11	Drones are locked. Nobody move.

CHRIS	See you at my court-martial.

ECHO 11	We were never here. 

KIRK	With all respect, fuck you, sir.

EHO 11	You got eyes on them? Do not lose them!

EUGENE	Bomb!

CHRIS	Oh, God. Oh, God. We should have helped them! We could have saved them before it was too late!

CHRIS	And what about these guys? They're still in France?

CHRIS	Why did you guys put us in the fucking war at all?

DR. ENGEL	World War II scenario has been the most effective for linking like-minded soldiers with purpose, with brotherhood,

DR. ENGEL	something the sim just can't create by itself.

DR. ENGEL	For six weeks, you all were thriving, making miraculous recoveries despite your conditions,

DR. ENGEL	especially in the mind.

DR. ENGEL	A few days ago, Butchie Martinson woke from an induced coma

DR. ENGEL	for reasons we don't understand.

DR. ENGEL	And when he saw his body,

DR. ENGEL	he just simply shut his eyes, and he died. 

CHRIS	Butchie tried to tell us. This isn't real.

CHRIS	Phantom itch.

ANN	You have an itch? 

CHRIS	No, in the sim.

CHRIS	Kirk was always scratching his feet.

CHRIS	And the Morse code we heard was a message from...

CHRIS	us.

CHRIS	"I have no legs." That was our subconscious mind telling us what we couldn't see for ourselves.

CHRIS	And, "You leave, you die."

DISTORTED VOICE	YOU LEAVE, YOU DIE

CHRIS	Not a threat, but a warning about the sim.

ANN	You sent subliminal messages to yourselves?

ANN	That's... that's incredible.

DR. ENGEL	Yeah. And dangerous. There's got to be a way to shut that down.

DR. ENGEL	More CTZ to the frontal lobe. 

CHRIS	Your sim is haunted, you know.

CHRIS	There's a ghost in the machine, or a computer virus,

CHRIS	or a programmer with a fuck-ton of issues,

CHRIS	unless it's supposed to feel like you're in a horror movie.

DR. ENGEL	How so?

CHRIS	That's not part of the program?

CHRIS	Sticking in avatars of previously engaged combatants?

CHRIS	Reliving old missions?

DR. ENGEL	God, no!

DR. ENGEL	The simulation is meant to be benign. World War II was chosen because it would trigger fewer real-world memories.

CHRIS	What about the word "vetrulek?"

CHRIS	What?

ANN	You all whispered that word at one time or another.

ANN	The Internet says it's a Muslim curse...

MRS. HELWIG	Vetrulek!

DR. ENGEL	What the hell is that?

CHRIS	We brought the Helwigs into the sim with us.

CHRIS	We brought them to life, we gave them power.

ANN	But it's just a program. None of it is real.

CHRIS	It's real when you're fucking in it! The prayers, everything!

DR. ENGEL	Get an EVAC team down here immediately!

CHRIS	Look, you gotta put me back in there!

ANN	No! I'm going to sedate them.

ANN	20 milliliters Propofol.

CHRIS	Put me back in! I can save them!

CHRIS	We were blind to what we did to them. They tried to show us, but we couldn't see.

CHRIS	Just look for yourself.

CHRIS	Are my memories of Afghanistan supposed to be there?

ANN	Okay. I'll put you back.

ANN	But what will you do? 

CHRIS	We need to face what we did, atone for our sins before it's too late.Do it!Okay. 

AUTOMATED VOICE	Initiating emergency procedures.
