CHLOE	What is this? It's okay. You keep going. Come on.

UMA	Chloe? Chloe! Chloe, where are you?

CHLOE	Uma! Uma! Uma! Uma!

UMA	Chloe? Chloe?

DUCHESS	Uma.

UMA	What are you?

DUCHESS	I'm just like you. A nasty little thorn in Mother's side.


DUCHESS	(SINGING) Five little bugs came out to play On a spider's web one day They got caught, all in a bunch And along I came In time for lunch!  At Mother's age, I can't exactly stop now, can I? Who'd want me then? Who'd want me then?

UMA	Leave her alone! I said leave her alone.

DUCHESS	Isn't this cute? A family reunion.

UMA	That's my substitute, you idiot. I'm the one you want. No, I'm the one you want. Don't listen. She's lying to you. That's my substitute. I'm the one you're looking for. How can you not recognize me? Don't listen to her. It's me, liar. Liar! I'm the one you want!

DUCHESS	Enough! Now... which one are you?

UMA	I am me.

MALE MISSING	We're still missing one substitute. Keep searching.

MARKUS	Copy. Uma. Uma. She lied to me. She told me that you chose him. She told me that you chose Son over me.

UMA	How much did she pay you?

MARKUS	I won't take it.

MALE MISSING	All clear over there, partner? Partner?

MARKUS	Yes, sir. All clear.

UMA	Here. This belongs to you. Thank you. What are you gonna do now? There's nothing left where I came from. Your parents? I tried to take care of my two little brothers... but 16 hours a day working in a factory, it wasn't enough. This man came to our town and offered me this job... if you can call it a job. He promised me my brothers would never go hungry again. I had to become somebody else so I could survive. I had to become you. I'm sorry. What's your name? Anna. It's nice to meet you, Anna.

DRUNK GUEST	Sing it again, sweetheart!

YOUNG GUEST	What a stunning bride.

GUEST MAN 1	And what a stupendous wedding. Your daughter is the epitome of Upper perfection.

GUEST WOMAN 1	She's earned the life ahead of her.

GUEST WOMAN 2	You must be so very proud.

ELOISE	Indeed.

GUEST MAN 2	And here she is. He was heartbroken... when you were the only one who went missing after that disaster. Only a man in love can suffer like that.

GUEST WOMAN 3	You should feel fortunate.

UMA	I do. Very much so. I just can't imagine how difficult it must've been for him. I mean, he's invested so much in me.

GUEST MAN 2	Smile, kid. You're giving it all back to him now.

SON'S ASSISTANT	Mr. Hingston is expecting you upstairs.  A husband shouldn't be kept waiting any longer.

SON	That place works miracles. You could be so difficult before. But now... it's as if that girl never existed.

UMA	Please, don't worry. I'll go.

ELOISE	Uma! Uma! Baby, what happened?
