DAD	Wow...

ABBY/LAURE	Ew, look.

DAD	It's a trout. That one's for you, Abby. 

LAURE	What about me? 

DAD	Next one.

MOM	Hi!

BOY	No!

GINGER MAN	Where you goin’! Fuck!

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN 	Damn kid!

GINGER MAN	Damn!

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	 Is he out? Is the kid out?

GINGER MAN	What did you do?

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	 Go, go. I'll open the trunk. Tie him up. Not a fuckin’ bowtie, tie him tight! He can’t feel it anyway.

GINGER MAN	Grab him.

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	Got him... Got him. 

OVERWEIGHT WOMAN	Come on! Take your sweet time there!

GINGER MAN	Will you be quiet!

MOM	Okay, let’s take a picture! Just go stand with Abby. Go, go, go. You go down and stand together really close. 

MOM	Keep smiling. Look at me the whole time, okay? Keep smiling, okay? 

MOM	Abby? Abby! Honey, look at the camera!

MOM	Big smile okay. Great big smile.

MOM/DAD (TO FAMILY)	Cheese! CLIFTON HILL

TWENTY-SOMETHING GIRL	What’s that?

TWENTY-SOMETHING BOY	My “Iron Ring”.

TWENTY-SOMETHING GIRL	Wow.

TWENTY-SOMETHING BOY	They give it to the engineers when we graduate. The iron’s from the first Quebec Bridge that collapsed and killed thirteen people.

TWENTY-SOMETHING GIRL	That’s kind of morbid.

TWENTY-SOMETHING BOY	It’s symbolic. I think they use stainless steel now. Iron turns your fingers black

BUS DRIVER	Good afternoon, folks. We’re about ten minutes from our destination and about ten seconds from your first glimpse of the Falls.

RANDY	May I first give you my deepest condolences. Your mother was a force, but you guys would know that better than anybody.. Now, where’s my glasses...

LAURE	So, I just sign this, and it’s done?

RANDY	No. I need you both to sign it.

ABBY	She agreed to this?

RANDY	Well, the building’s worthless. It’s less than worthless, when you count the cost of tearing it down. But that is a fair price for the land.

ABBY	The Charles Lake Company?

RANDY	It wasn’t exactly a bidding war.

ABBY	The Rainbow was everything to her.

RANDY	She wasn’t given much of a choice… was she?

LAURE	This looks good to me.

ABBY	Laure...

ABBY	Laure... Come on, this is our legacy.

LAURE	Abby, are you serious?

ABBY	The agreement says we have six weeks. C’mon, we have to try.

LAURE	Try? Try what? The… The Rainbow?

ABBY	It’s what Mom would want. 

LAURE	Mom arranged the sale you just walked out on. The place is a dump, Abby. Hookers wouldn’t even use it.

ABBY	They’re gonna turn it into a fucking glow-in the-dark mini-golf, or something.

LAURE	Good!

ABBY	We grew up there!

LAURE	Yeah, one of us grew up.

SINGH	Jesus! This thing is not…

SINGH	Hey, man, I think the jukebox is broken. 

BARTENDER	Sorry. 

SINGH	But the sign said that

ABBY	Sign says it’s free.

ABBY	Doesn’t say it works.

SINGH	Well, shit. 

ABBY	Just so you know, the haunted houses aren’t actually haunted. And the fun houses aren’t actually fun.

SINGH	Nice one. I like that.

ABBY	Just saving you money, dude. 

ABBY	Passing through?

SINGH	Here for a job. So, I guess you’re a local?

ABBY	I grew up here.

SINGH	That means you’re a local.

ABBY	I grew up here. 

SINGH	You grew up here. Well, okay, Miss I-Grew-Up-Here I thought that this whole place was supposed to be like Vegas and it’s not.
ABBY	Well, it’s the low season. They even turn down the Falls.

SINGH	How do you turn Niagara Falls down? 

ABBY	It’s a series of locks, divert the water to the power plant. I’m doing my Master’s on the hydro dam. Trying to get that iron ring. It’s an engineering thing. The metal's from a… a bridge that killed a bunch of people. 

ABBY	It’s morbid, but... symbolic.
SINGH	Is that true, seriously?

ABBY	Look it up. You know what I’d do? I’d dry the whole thing up. Like the Americans did back in the day. This is a nice town. But the thing drives people crazy. It’s just a bunch of water falling over some rocks. 

SINGH	Do you want another one? 

ABBY	Sure.

SINGH	Wow. Whoa.

ABBY	Well, it’s… not exactly how it looks on the website. Wait.

SINGH	I like that. 

ABBY	Yeah. 

SINGH	I like that. Okay. 

ABBY	I’m a virgin. 

SINGH	What did you say? 

ABBY	Nothing.

SINGH	Wait, wait. Did you… just say you’re a virgin?

ABBY	No. 

SINGH	You’re not a virgin. There's... You just… 

SINGH	You just picked up a stranger in a bar! So, what’s up with that? Hello? Fuck. Weird as fuck!

ABBY	Sorry. No vacancy. 

CHARLIE	Are you Abby? Abby. Charlie. From the CLC. No. Look, I’m not here to start any trouble. We’re a family business, too. I understand what you’re going through. We...lost my father a few years back. It was…   Condolences.

CHARLIE	I was actually surprised to hear from your mother when we did. Takes a certain kind of moxie to run a place like this.

ABBY	What does it take to pilfer it from a vulnerable widow?

CHARLIE	I just want you to know if you do change your mind… No hard feelings. Really. Pleasure to meet you, Abby.

ABBY	Thanks.

LAURE	For what?

ABBY	Dinner.

LAURE	It was his idea. 

ABBY	So, Marcus, what do you do at the casino? 

MARCUS	Well, nothing fancy like your sister.

LAURE	He’s our first line of defense. 

LAURE	Tell her what you look for. It’s very scientific. 

MARCUS	Okay. Well, there is a certain art to it. Rapid blinking, placing objects between themselves and the dealer. Feet pointed towards an exit. Well, verbally, it’s stuff, like formalized language…I mean, like, “I did not have sexual relations…”

WALTER	Hi. Fishing lures. Just fishing lures today. But I have found other things, I can tell you. 

ABBY	Like what?

WALTER	Firearms, watches, wedding rings. That one’s usually a grand gesture! Everything that goes over the Falls ends up flowing through this big basin here. Sometimes I get lucky. Walter. Nice to meet you.

ABBY	Nice to meet you. 

WALTER	Yeah. Out of town? 

ABBY	Vancouver. 

WALTER	That’s far away. Well, you’ve come to the right guy. Yeah. I’m sort of the town historian. You like podcasts? 

ABBY	Sure. 

WALTER	Yeah, it’s called “Over the Falls”. Lot of history around these parts. An awful lot of history.

ABBY	I bet. 

WALTER	Well… remember...rate and review. The podcast. It helps our rankings.

WALTER	Good night, darlin’.

AUTOMATED VOICE	Alien life-form approaching.

WALTER	So, what are you implying?

ABBY	The Moulins killed their own kid. The abuse, the tiger attack, the blackmail

WALTER	Yeah, yeah, yeah...

ABBY	Cui prodest, right? Bev Mole and the Moulins are bound. It’s been a Cold War ever since.

WALTER	I thought you were a smart kid. I thought your eyes were open. 

ABBY	"Complete the picture." That’s what this is. It isn’t some dubious campaign against the Lake family.

WALTER	You think you know these people. 

ABBY	I’ve seen you driving by my motel. Snooping around. You’re paranoid.

WALTER	Don’t you mean CLC’s motel? Or maybe you just forgot to mention your pending land deal. Goodbye.

ABBY	Fuck! Fuck!

VOCALIST	...Once, once it was mine If love’s a tear I want to cry If it has wings I wanna fly I know I’d never, never let go Once, once it was mine If there’s a sip of wine I want to taste it This heart and these lips of mine Don’t want to be wasted If love’s a game I want to play If there’s a price I want to pay Let me at least...

U.S. BORDER AGENT	Where you going today? 

ABBY	Just to town. Seeing a show.

U.S. BORDER AGENT	Enjoy the show.

ABBY	Thank you.

VOCALISTS	<singing> Once it was mine Once it was mine Once it was mine Once it was mine

ANNOUNCER	Ladies and gentlemen! Please take your seats. The show is about to begin. Ladies and gentlemen! The Cayuga Casino is proud to present the two-time world champions of magic the marvelous, miraculous, magical, Magnificent Moulins!

MRS. MOULIN	Bonsoir! Good evening!

MR. MOULIN	Thank you! Thank you and welcome to my show! 

MRS. MOULIN	What?!

MRS. MOULIN	Your show?! 

MR. MOULIN	Well... who’s show is it? 

MR. MOULIN	What is this?! What is going on? 

MRS. MOULIN	I think it is time to teach this animal a lesson! What do you think?

MRS. MOULIN	Bye. One, two, three!

MRS. MOULIN	The amazing Heka! Isn’t she beautiful? She loves your applause. 

MRS. MOULIN	We adopted her when she was six months old. Her mother died, she was left all alone. Abandoned. Hungry. But she’s a fighter!

MRS. MOULIN	Isn’t that right, Heka? What, Heka?

MRS. MOULIN	Did I hear that? You miss Mr. Moulin?

MRS. MOULIN	She wants me to bring him back.

MRS. MOULIN	Do I have to? Okay. Mr. Moulin! Where are you?

MR. MOULIN	Here I am!

MR. MOULIN	Thank you! Thank you, Heka!

MR. MOULIN 	And thank you, my love!

MRS. MOULIN	Thank you!

MRS. MOULIN	What is your name?

MRS. MOULIN	Good night.

ABBY	You guys... wow!

MRS. MOULIN	You’re way too kind! Who should I make it out to?

ABBY	Just make it out to Alex.

ABBY	I’ll be at the diner across the street.

VOCALIST	Won't you break my heart One more time Won't you kiss my lips One more time I'll be back when I know What I'll find You'll just break my heart One more time

ABBY	I don’t think you can smoke here.

WAITRESS	Coffee, Mrs. Moulin?

MRS. MOULIN	No.

VOCALIST	Do me wrong I don't care 

ABBY	Touching story about the tiger. I even saw some tears. Imagine the reaction if you told them about your dead son. How’d you do it?

MRS. MOULIN	It’s been twenty-five years. We’ve learned to adjust.

ABBY	I mean the tiger trick. It’s really spectacular.

MR. MOULIN	Look, what exactly do you want? 

MRS. MOULIN	She wants money…

MRS. MOULIN	imbecile! She sent you? Tell her she won’t get another grubby dime from us. We’ve got Chernobyl of dirt on her compared to that.

WAITRESS	Can I get anybody something

MRS. MOULIN	No, fuck off!

MRS. MOULIN	That woman stole from us. Blackmailed us, she almost ruined our careers!

ABBY	Not to mention, kidnapped your son.

MRS. MOULIN	She didn’t send you?

VOCALIST	You'll need a friend But there won't be...

ABBY	Keep it. I have the originals.

MR. MOULIN	Well, how much?

ABBY	I don’t want money. I want the truth.

MRS. MOULIN	Truth. You’re pretty smart? But what you’re doing here is fucking dopey. But I’ll admit you do it with a certain exuberance.

ABBY	You’re stalling.

MRS. MOULIN	The truth. 

MR. MOULIN	The truth.

MRS. MOULIN	The truth...

MR. MOULIN	The truth is... we don’t know. We paid her the money. The deal was she would take him back to the farm. But he never got there. We went to the police. They told us he committed suicide. They didn’t want to listen to us! Now, that Chicken hawk Charles Lake...was trying to send us a message. The police... and that bitch Beverly, they were all on the payroll.

ABBY	What message?

MR. MOULIN	He took my boy. Mon bébé. 

MR. MOULIN	Mon petit garcon. 

MRS. MOULIN	The truth...he was there...tied up in his little cage. Half-conscious. And we saw an opportunity. We tried to teach Alex, tried to include him. But he was spoiled, soft. Tigers bow to strength. Fear only makes them salivate. It was really his fault more than the tiger’s.It could have sent him over the cliff. The body breaks up on the rocks. The sad child does what sad children do. 

MRS. MOULIN	I’ll have some coffee please, now. Thank you.

MRS. MOULIN	Feels good to get that off our chest, doesn’t it, boy? 

MR. MOULIN	Yeah.

MRS. MOULIN	There you have it, the truth... and a lie. You have to decide which is which. More homework, I’m afraid. 
MRS. MOULIN	Don’t be embarrassed, honey. Don’t.

MRS. MOULIN	It’s smoke and mirrors, by the way, the trick.

MRS. MOULIN	We drop a mirror between Heka and the audience. A little redirection... a little light…

MRS. MOULIN	Go ahead… tell someone. See if they believe you. Now scram.

MR. MOULIN	Scram!

BORDER OFFICER	Whoa, whoa. Slow down!

BORDER OFFICER	How long were you in the States?

SINGH	Abby, this is strictly voluntary. Your sister has graciously agreed to take you in for the time being. However, I think you owe her an explanation as to what you were doing with her passport.

RANDY	It’s okay, Abby.

LAURE	My sister has these... cycles. 

SINGH	Laure, do you know what your sister was doing before she came back home?

LAURE	She mentioned something about bumming around Toronto with a… a boyfriend and fucking that all up, or...

LAURE	 What is this? 

RANDY	That is Abby’s last cycle. She was in Phoenix, Arizona, the last eighteen months claiming that she had retrograde amnesia. Do you know what that is?
SINGH	It’s when you hit your head and lose all memory of anything that happened before the injury.

RANDY	She convinced people she didn’t know who she was. Her name, her family, anything.

RANDY	People thought that she’d escaped some human trafficking ring. And then a local caseworker made Abby his pet cause, trying to get the state to issue her an ID. It was a bit of a story down there. The press dubbed her “Jane of the Desert”. And then once she got exposed, it got pretty messy, as you can imagine. Lawyers, psychiatrists, meds. The deportation. She was banned from ever going back into the United States. And it was your mom who came to her rescue.

LAURE	Mom?  She paid for all this? 

RANDY	Yes. With a loan against the sale of the motel. 

LAURE	Why didn’t she tell me?

RANDY	Because she was afraid it was going to tear the two of you apart, permanently. This had a real cost on your mom.

LAURE	Abby... you are my sister and I love you, despite everything. Just look me in the eye and tell me you did this. That’s all.

ABBY	I got them, Laure. They told me.

LAURE	Who? Who told you what? 

ABBY	The Moulins.

LAURE	No, Abby, we are not… we are not doing this.

ABBY	So you don’t believe any of this now? 

LAURE	Just tell me you’ll get help, I will be there the whole way.

ABBY	They laid it all out for me. They told me how they killed him and why. It’s means, motive, opportunity!

LAURE	Stop it!  

ABBY	The Moulins! You have to bring them in for questioning! 

LAURE	The Moulins? I thought Alex was whacked by some evil consortium

ABBY	I got the whole story, Laure!

LAURE	I’m sure it’s very interesting. But it just doesn’t add up.

SINGH	Abby, why can’t you just admit what you did in Phoenix?

ABBY	Because I’m not… Because I was protecting myself. 

ABBY	I’m not a liar. I’m not.  

ACTOR #1	…under the circumstances that you have a perfect right.

ACTOR #2	You do?

ACTOR #1	Well, I wouldn’t want to do it without a witness.

ACTOR #2	Well, that’s me.

ACTOR #1	It is? Well, that’s all I wanted to know...

BEVERLY	All right. Bye, babe. See you.

WOMAN	...and I felt like if I could just move my head over a little bit I could see who it is.

ABBY	Calm down. It’s okay. Don’t panic… Please. I just want to talk to you.

Okay.

ABBY	I want to show you something. Look at these. 

GERRY	What?

ABBY	I need you to look at these, please. You remember that day? This is me. 

GERRY	I don’t

ABBY	Look. Look, please!

ABBY	You see?

ABBY	You remember this day?

ABBY	You want to make it right again?

GERRY	I do... I just...

ABBY	Yeah. I can get you out of here. But I need you to do something for me.

GERRY	Yeah.

ABBY	You understand?

WALTER	Ndio, kwe and yineh to the “Over the Falls” podcast. Recorded live from the hangar deck of Niagara’s only flying saucer. I’m Walter Bell. And, folks, as Lawrence Welk would say, “It’s wonderful, wonderful to be here.

BEVERLY	Get the fuck out of my house!

WALTER	We have a very special episode for you today. Our long-time listeners will surely know why. For over 20 years I’ve been telling the police that Charles Lake II had Alex Moulin murdered all to protect his son, current CLC boss Charles III and his elicit taste for young, vulnerable boys. We fought a long and bloody battle to bring retribution to this criminal clan. So, today, I’m proud to say we are on the cusp of victory.

FIELD REPORTER	This sleepy neighbourhood in the suburban town of Ajax, 45 minutes outside of Toronto, was shaken by the sounds of a police raid as officers charged into this bungalow behind me. Inside, 58-year-old retiree, Beverly Mole, was arrested for the forcible confinement and suspected torture of her physically disabled husband. However, when police talked to the victim, 51-year-old Gerry Mole, he dropped a bombshell no one saw coming. According to Gerry, his wife was the hired gun for a ghastly crime that took place almost 25 years ago. A crime she committed on behalf of the now-deceased Niagara Falls tycoon

FIELD REPORTER	Charles Lake II.


FIELD REPORTER	A crime that, until now, wasn’t even a crime at all.

WALTER	Who could have fathomed such a fate for young Alex? Tortured by his parents, defiled by a deviant then fed to a den of tigers like some ritual slaughter. Truly, this was a masterpiece of degeneracy.

MRS. MOULIN	We did not know about the abuse. We certainly did not know about his murder. We intend to fight this gross, malicious slander.

FIELD REPORTER	Someone who was willing to comment was this man, Walter Bell, who many in the region would recognize as a member of the local daredevil and water rescue team, The Diving Bells. Walter was a part of the original search-party that scoured the Niagara River for any evidence of Alex Moulin’s remains. According to Walter, something seemed off immediately.

WALTER 	Of course, Alex wasn’t the first.  We’ve only started to scratch the surface on the story, believe me. I also have a podcast. It’s called “Over the Falls”.

WALTER	As we await the outcome of this re-opened investigation, I remind my listeners of our long fight for justice against nepotism, beguiling iniquity and bloodshed. To everyone that stuck with us, thus always to tyrants.

ABBY	Can I help you?

MAN	Yeah...

MAN	You have a room? 

ABBY	How many nights?

MAN	Don’t know yet.

ABBY	I have a room. I just need your driver’s license and credit card. 

MAN	Yeah. I only have cash.


ABBY	Okay. Do you have any ID?

MAN	How much?

ABBY	A hundred-dollar deposit.

ABBY	Vancouver.

MAN	Yeah. 

ABBY	It’s a long way from home. First time in Niagara Falls?

MAN	First time in a long time.

ABBY	What brings you back?

MAN	Do we know each other?

ABBY	No.

MAN	You know...

MAN	he’s not lying.

ABBY	He never hurt that kid?

MAN	No. Saved his life.

MAN	That mine?

ABBY	Yeah.

MAN	Thanks… Abby.

VOCALIST	Sometimes I get so lonely Sometimes I feel so blue
