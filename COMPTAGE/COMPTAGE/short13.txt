THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...Not giving up when something goes wrong. 

THOMAS	Connor is a very fast engine. But one day when he was travelling very quickly, his coupling rod came loose and he nearly derailed. 

THOMAS	Connor was fixed at the Steamworks, and Victor told him that now he was repaired he could go full speed again. 

THOMAS	But Connor was still worried! So he decided to travel really slowly so he didn't have any more accidents. But that made him late and his passengers angry!

THOMAS	Stephen told Connor that back in his day, engines often broke down. But they didn't give up no matter what happened! 

THOMAS	Connor realised Stephen was right, although he'd had an accident, he should keep doing his best. So to make sure he wasn't late again, Connor raced at full speed to the next station!

THOMAS	And that's why you shouldn't give up, even if something went wrong the first time.
