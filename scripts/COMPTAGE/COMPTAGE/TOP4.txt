NIGEL	Hello and welcome Thomas fans to another Top Five Sodor Moments... And welcome to my good friend Stan.

STAN	Hello, Nigel. So what are we looking at today?

NIGEL	Today, Stan we're looking at the top five 'engine breakdowns'.

STAN	Ahh, you mean the times when our engines cause Confusion and Delay through no fault of their own.

NIGEL	Indeed!

STAN	Well, straight in at number five is Harold!

NIGEL	Harold's not and engine, Stan.

STAN	No, Nigel but he is part of The Fat Controller’s team.

NIGEL	And he is Really Useful. Especially in an emergency.

STAN	Absolutely! But one day when his rotor blades jammed Thomas and Duck had to take him back to the Search and Rescue Centre by rail.

NIGEL	Ooh, how exiting! Was this Harold's first journey by rail?

STAN	It certainly was, Nigel. But helicopters aren't meant to travel by rail. 

NIGEL	You're right, Stan. They have trouble buying a ticket…

STAN 	<sarcastic laugh>

NIGEL	…ha ha ha ha and getting onto the platform…

STAN	Hmm. 

NIGEL	…and getting served in the buffet car..

STAN	Ha yeah. 

NIGEL	…and getting a seat and…

STAN	(Interrupting) Yeah well er let's just say I think Harold was pleased to be back in the air shall we?

NIGEL	And 'flying' in at number four is... Percy!

STAN	Percy! Fizzling Fireboxes!

NIGEL	Well, it wasn't fizzling fireboxes after Percy ran into deep water at the quarry and his firebox went out!

STAN	You could say a bit of 'wash out' for Percy, then...

NIGEL	And then when Diesel tried to rescue Percy, water got into his generator! 

STAN	So we've got two breakdowns for the price of one!

NIGEL	What a bargain! Are there three breakdowns next?

STAN	Er let's not get carried away, Nigel... At number three is Hiro!

NIGEL	Ahh, yes. Hiro by name and hero by nature! 

STAN	But this time it was Henry who was the hero. After some bad coal caused his pipes to get blocked, Hiro literally ran out of steam.

NIGEL	And did Hhhenry hhhelp Hhhiro up that high hill?

STAN	'Hapsolutly! 

NIGEL	Hhhhhooray! What a hero!

STAN	Gripping stuff, these countdowns.

NIGEL	But not for our number two... Caitlin!
STAN	That's right, Nigel Caitlin's brakes failed on the way down Ulfstead hill..

NIGEL	Very nasty. And was Henry there to save her?

STAN	No.

NIGEL	Hiro?

STAN	No! As you can see this time it was Emily, she cleverly used her own brakes to slow Caitlin down.

NIGEL	Tricky manoeuvre. But beautifully handled! 

STAN	You know, Nigel if you're going to break down it's always good to have your friends there to help you.

NIGEL	Very true, Stan. 

STAN	But for our number one engine breakdown even that didn't help.

NIGEL	That's right! Poor Gordon was winning the Great Race when disaster struck and he broke down!

STAN 	He certainly did. And what a breakdown it was! But he wouldn't have broken down if he'd listened to his friends!

NIGEL	There's a moral in there somewhere, Stan. But at the moment I just can't think of it...

STAN	Er... If you're going to break down, it's always good to have your friends there to help you?

NIGEL	Ooh that's a good one, Stan! Let's write it down in case we forget. Have you got a pen?

STAN	Er, no...I…

NIGEL	Chalk? 

STAN 	Well, until next time.

NIGEL 	When we see you again for more Top Five Sodor Moments!

STAN	Oh! I've just found a pencil will that do?

NIGEL	Great... (pause) Have you got any paper?
