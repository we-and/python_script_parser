F. pull violet	all the lights work. then we would put them on the tree and inevitably, there is a strand that doesn’t work. 

Homme pull vert	with the tree dazzler, i can get them out of the box and onto the tree, with a brilliant display, in less than three minutes.

F. pull violet	the remote is so easy to use. i mean it’s 3 buttons. how hard is that?! the lights don’t burn out. they don’t break. and they don’t tangle.

Homme pull vert	the tree dazzler is easy to use, lasts for years and it just couldn’t be more beautiful.

joe	let’s do a side by side comparison: traditional lights and tree dazzler.

mindy	well there’s really no comparison. those are bold and beautiful. right?

joe	this is a bundle of brightness! these we’ve seen before and their tough to work with.

mindy	oh my gosh yeah. i mean, once you get them out, first you have to untangle them then you have to wrap them around the tree. right?

joe	you see, with tree dazzler, look, you lift it out of the box, put it on the tree and you just light it up. it’s beautiful. there are no tangles! now i see you’ve got some lights burned out…

mindy	yep, burned out and they also burn hot. it’s just the way they are. 

joe	tree dazzler is cool to the touch. plus, they will never burn out. we have a 10 year stay bright guarantee. okay, let’s add some color, come on. i hit the button…

mindy	candy cane!

joe	you got it. or multi-color!

mindy	i love that one.

joe	wait a minute, look. i love the green too! 

mindy	pretty.

joe	how do you add color to the traditional lights?

mindy	well, i guess i’d have to buy a green and a red and then probably a multi-colored strand. 

joe	that’s not good!

mindy	no…

joe	look i’ve got a shimmer effect. watch this on the blue. they go in and they go out. shimmer your lights! 

mindy	brings them to life, right?

joe	yes!

mindy	does that count?

joe	no! no shimmer right?

mindy	no shimmer.

joe	okay wait, let’s put on a show. all the multi-color. here’s the christmas scroll. this is gorgeous. put on a show! 

mindy	umm, no show joe. 

joe	no show. i’ve got 16 dazzling displays with a push of a button.

mindy	umm zero displays and no button. 

joe	oh... these are meant to be stacked one on top of the other. it’s so simple to do. and when you do it, you double the dazzle. 

mindy	and i guess i’d have to go buy more lights and double to hassle.

joe	hey, it’s obvious. what’s the new number one tree lights? 

Joe/mindy	tree dazzler!

mindy	i love this tree.

joe	…we’ve got two tree dazzlers, one stacked on top of the other, just like that! they’re built so that you can do this, okay. now, if you have one tree dazzler, guess what, you get 16 dazzling displays. but with two, its endless! i’m telling you you can do this all day long and have gorgeous looks. in fact, right now, we’re on still white, on both of them. you take this controller and change it to whatever you want.

mindy	okay, i have an idea in mind. let me get to the blue. i think is pretty! it’s beautiful.

joe	and it changes the entire look of this tree. 

mindy	i have never seen anything like this. the possibilities really are endless!

F. blonde cheveux mi-long 	christmas is always our  ’s favorite time of year and we love the tree dazzler. it’s that little something extra special that really just makes the holiday festive. as a mom, it’s really comforting to me that the tree dazzler is so safe for the kids. the lights are bigger than usual. they’re cool to the touch. they are virtually unbreakable. the controller makes it very clear, very easy to create whatever mood you want. every night the kids take turns choosing a different color, a different display, a different shimmer. they really get excited in making the tree just light up as we count down to the big day. they can also set that mood for those cozy nights in front of the fire leading up to christmas day. the tree dazzler is so much fun. it really has now become part of our family holiday tradition.

joe	the only thing faster than putting tree dazzler on the tree is taking it off the tree and that’s exactly what i’m gonna do right now while you mindy have to take the traditional lights off that tree.

mindy	well, you know what, i’ve got pine needles all over the place now! haha!

joe	bigger, better, bolder lights. more dazzling displays and now, add to it, easy on the tree and easy taking it off the tree. you can’t beat that!

F. pull violet		“christmas is wonderful except when you have to undo the tree. but with the  tree dazzler, no more tangles! you take the ring on the top, you lift it off, the strands follow the ring, you put them in the box and you’re done. it’s like, wow!”
