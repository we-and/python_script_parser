WADE TO FRED        Does it matter?
WADE        Nice to get away, huh?
WADE        Yeah. Remote.
WADE        Remote, huh?
WADE        Everything okay in there?
WADE        He bothering you?
WADE        Boy, you're a real mess.
WADE        Look at that.
WADE        Brought a knife to a gunfight, didn't even use it.
WADE        Mm.
WADE        Spicy.
WADE        What's your code?
WADE        So peaceful here, isn't it?
WADE        Remote.
WADE        Thank you.
WADE        Aw.
WADE        That's a good one.
WADE        Jenny.
WADE        God damn.
WADE        You're a lucky man.
WADE        Were.
WADE        Jesus Christ.
WADE        Come on.
WADE        Need help?
WADE        Like this?
WADE        Miranda?
WADE        Miranda?
WADE        Miranda?
WADE        Come on.
WADE        Stop being a little bitch.
WADE        Come on out.
WADE        I'm not gonna hurt you.
WADE        Come on.
WADE        Be a good girl now. Come on out.
WADE        I'll be your new daddy.
WADE        Miranda, don't make me angry.
WADE        Oh.
WADE        It's delicious. Thank you, hon.
WADE        Really?
WADE        Nance.
WADE        Excuse me.
WADE        Oh.
WADE        Hi, Cupcake.
WADE        Hi, Cupcake.
WADE        You better stop calling. Eddie might get jealous.
WADE        I can do this all night.
WADE        It's fine.
WADE        She's not alone.
WADE        What the--?
WADE        No, no, no, no. No.
WADE        Fuck.
WADE        Fuck.
WADE        Nice fucking trick.
WADE        Doesn't matter. You're all the same.
WADE        Fucking deceptive, manipulative fucking cunts.
WADE        She's not as smart as she thinks she is.
WADE        Well, she's about to be a dead little girl.
WADE        Survival,
WADE        the act or fact of living
WADE        or continuing longer than another person or thing.
WADE        That's the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition.
WADE        So basically, I don't have to run faster
WADE        than the man-eating tiger,
WADE        I just have to run faster than you.
WADE        That's what I mean by strategic default.
WADE        Say the value of your house
WADE        drops below what you owe on the mortgage.
WADE        What do you do?
WADE        What do you do?
WADE        You stop making payments.
WADE        Now it's not your problem. It's the bank's problem.
WADE        And fuck the bank.
WADE        So, if your business is going under, you just--
WADE        tuck your tail between your legs?
WADE        Close up shop? No.
WADE        No.
WADE        You take as much unsecured debt as you can,
WADE        in the name of the business, of course.
WADE        You cut expenses to the bone.
WADE        You leverage that cash to open a new business.
WADE        By the time the bank figures out
WADE        your old business is dead, you're on to your next target.
WADE        The key is to stay in the game.
WADE        Keep moving before anybody can figure out
WADE        what you're doing.
WADE        You keep moving forward like a shark. Right?
WADE        You're either predator or you're prey.
WADE        Survival of the fittest.
WADE        A simple concept,
WADE        but it's not as easy as it sounds.
WADE        You gotta take risks.
WADE        Why do I waste my time?
WADE        You know what, cut the camera.
WADE        Everybody get out.
WADE        What? I'm letting you go early, okay?
WADE        You're welcome.
WADE        Go. Everybody get the hell out of my classroom.
WADE        Robert.
WADE        Make sure and post the lecture today.
WADE        Don't fuck it up like last time.
WADE        And cancel my office hours. I'm going home.
WADE        Miranda?
WADE        Miranda?
WADE        Miranda?
WADE        Hi, Cupcake.
WADE        Calm down, Jenny.
WADE        I want you to kill me.
WADE        Maybe I am. Maybe I am.
WADE        Take the fucking gun and shoot me.
WADE        Please.
WADE        Here, take the gun.
WADE        Stop asking the same question over and over, Jenny.
WADE        Here I am. Do it!
WADE        I did.
WADE        She's dead, Jenny! I fucking killed her!
WADE        Don't you get that?
WADE        Come on! Come on. Come here. Come here.
WADE        Come here. You can do it.
WADE        We'll do it together, okay? Come on.
WADE        I know you can do it.
WADE        You have to rack the gun, dummy.
WADE        Hi, Emily Cooper?
WADE        My name is Randy. I'm a nurse here
WADE        at the maternity ward,
WADE        and uh-- your mom, or your stepmom, I guess,
WADE        Jenny, is here with us.
WADE        She's very concerned about Miranda.
WADE        Can you tell me about her?
WADE        Uh-huh. Oh, that's great news.
WADE        She'll be very relieved.
WADE        Yeah. Yes, she is in labor,
WADE        but I'm sure it's still several hours away.
WADE        She would love it if you could do her a big favor
WADE        and stop by the house
WADE        to pick up her overnight bag that she left behind.
WADE        Yes. Yes, very exciting.
WADE        Little brother's on the way. Okay, bye-bye.
WADE        Our lucky day. They're on the way.
WADE        Welcome.
WADE        Hey, hey, hey.
WADE        Have a seat.
WADE        Wait.
WADE        Take it off.
WADE        Miranda, you're here next to me.
WADE        Hello, Emily Cooper. Nice to meet you in person.
WADE        We spoke on the phone.
WADE        Thanks for bringing Miranda home.
WADE        Have a seat.
WADE        This is nice.
WADE        Let's hold hands.
WADE        Bow your heads.
WADE        Close your eyes.
WADE        Dear Lord,
WADE        thank you for your random acts of betrayal,
WADE        adultery, wrath,
WADE        and violence,
WADE        for destroying families
WADE        and lives,
WADE        leaving nothing but death
WADE        and destruction in your wake.
WADE        Thank you for the rage and the thrill of the chase.
WADE        And thank you for these three beautiful women...
WADE        and for the glorious day ahead.
WADE        Amen.
WADE        Okay, the hand-holding is over now.
WADE        Let go.
WADE        Let's get started, shall we?
WADE        Sometimes when my wife was in the mood,
WADE        she enjoyed...
WADE        sharing a bottle of bubbly.
WADE        Ah. My wife.
WADE        So beautiful.
WADE        Now?
WADE        She's at home.
WADE        Where I left her.
WADE        In bed.
WADE        Dead.
WADE        You like it?
WADE        God, you look so much like her.
WADE        You're a quick learner, Cupcake.
WADE        It doesn't matter.
