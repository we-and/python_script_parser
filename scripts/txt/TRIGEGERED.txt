MR. PETERSON	This is all your fault.

MR. MILLER	No. What are you doin’? What are you doin’? What the f--

MR. PETERSON	There’s a good boy.

MR. MILLER	No. (cries) What’re you- what’re those? What the fuck are those? No. (crying) No. (gasping) 
(grunting)

MR. PETERSON	You left me no choice.

MR. MILLER	(grunting) (screams) (grunting) (muffled) Fuck! (grunting) He- help me! Somebody help me! 
Somebody help me! (grunting) 

MR. MILLER	Please don’t do this. They were fuckin’ kids. They’re just fuckin’ kids!

SHEA	We love you, Bobby.

CICI	You’re like a brother to us, Bobby.

BOBBY	Okay, why do I sense there’s a “but” coming here?

SHEA	But, this is the last time we let you organize us accommodations.

BOBBY	What? (exhales) You don’t like nature, huh? You don’t like the woods?

SHEA	I like electricity and I like hot water.

GROUP	(laughs)

KATO	Didn’t have to be so far out, man. There are closer camps.

EZRA	Yeah. We’re literally in the middle of nowhere, dude.

BOBBY	Okay, look. Every hotel within a thirty-mile radius was booked up. I mean everyone’s in town to 
watch the Hyenas demolish the Beavers tomorrow. Big game of football, small town, plus a little 
impromptu reunion with the nine of us means uh, not a lot of options to suit  everyone’s bank 
account. Okay?

GROUP	Great. / Great. Thanks.

PJ	Yeah, I don’t know. I’m pretty sure I can afford two rooms at the Tiki Motel.

EZRA	Sure-- 

KATO	People go to the Tiki Motel to get three things. Bed bugs, crack, dead. I’d rather share the woods 
with these vermin than step a foot in that shithole.

RIAN	Okay. There’s a lot of reasons why this is more advantageous than a hotel.

KATO	(overlapping) (sighs) Who says “advantageous”?

PJ	Uh, she does, bro.

RIAN	We can be as loud as we want. The fire’s awesome. And, we haven’t all been together in a while.

KATO	(coughs)

EZRA	Jesus, bro.

SHEA	Classic Kato.

AMBER	Still, such an idiot.

KATO	All right. All right. Laugh it up, a-holes. You don’t use that shit, you’re all gonna end up with Zika, 
Ebola, West Nile or Herpes.

AMBER	You’re such an idiot.

RIAN	(overlapping) Uh, relatively certain you can’t contract herpes from a mosquito.

KATO	Yeah, you can. Katie Krewson, my girlfriend junior year, she had it, she gave it to me. I asked her 
about it. She said she got it from a mosquito.

GROUP	(laughs)

EZRA	 don’t think that’s how it works, dude.

AMBER	Wait. That’s cured now, right?

KATO	Yeah. Probably.

BOBBY	Oh, gross.

EZRA	Where you goin', babe?

CICI	What, I can’t take a piss in the woods? Or do I have to get your permission for that, too? (grunts)

KATO	(whistles) Somebody put hot sauce in her taco.

BOBBY	What did you do, bro?

KATO	More like, who’d you do?

BOBBY	(laughs)

KATO	You got a reputation, man. That’s all I’m saying.

KATO	Chalk this one up to too many beers, but, the last person you wanna piss off is Cici, man. That 
chick is vindictive.

KATO	You remember-- What was that history teacher’s name?

RIAN	Mr. Edmunds.

PJ	Mr. Edmunds, gave Cici detention for texting in class one Friday.

KATO	So Monday, she comes back, posts on the N.A.M.B.L.A. forums from his school P.C.

PJ	NAMBLA?

RIAN	North American Man Boy Love Association.

GROUP	(laughs)

PJ	Ouch.

RIAN	Oh, poor Mr. Edmunds.

KATO	Guy gets arrested, put on the sex offender watch list.

BOBBY	Wa- wait. Seriously? Shit. I wondered what happened to that guy. Fuckin’ loved me. Gave me 
straight-As all the time.

PJ	Shea, you’re up.

EZRA	Yeah, we all did fucked-up shit in high school. No one here is innocent.

PJ	Well you know what I say? Fuck the past! Yeah.

KATO	(overlapping) Yeah. Fuck it.

EZRA	(overlapping) Yeah!

RIAN	Woo!

PJ	I’m just happy to be here right now.

AMBER	Boo! (laughs)

CICI	(overlapping) (gasps) Amber. You scared me.

AMBER	Sorry. So, you know I can read you like a book, right? Okay, well I don’t read books, but I can read 
you like a celebrity gossip blog. What did he do now? Wanna talk?

CICI	I think he’s cheating on me.

AMBER	(exhales) Okay. Well, if he is, then you need to be Amber Heard to his Johnny Depp and leave 
Ezra’s sorry ass.

CICI	I know. I just-- I kind of like making him fight for it. Watching him squirm.

AMBER	You are such a bitch.

AMBER	(overlapping) No wonder we’re besties.

RIAN	Hey, Erin.

ERIN	Oh, thanks.

RIAN	You seem quieter than usual.

ERIN	I’m fine. Just seeing everyone back together takes me back to high school. Wasn’t exactly the 
happiest time for me.

RIAN	I’m sorry.

ERIN	No, I, I don’t want this weekend to be about Caleb. I want it to be about having fun.

CICI	Remember when we played Truth or Dare and when it was her turn, you dared her to go home.

KATO	Oh, shit. (laughs)

CICI	(overlapping) (laughs) I’m just glad to see you’re not acting weird around Erin anymore.

KATO	High school was a long time ago.

KATO	(coughs) My taste in women has changed, for the worse.

AMBER	Dick.

KATO	I like a girl I can argue with, and then have explosive makeup sex with later. Besides, Erin’s been 
mute ever since, you know.

AMBER	Well, with what she’s been through, Kato,  maybe you should just cut her some slack.

KATO	W-- (grunts) I mean, she was like that before.

EZRA	(grunts) 

PJ	Need any help here, bro? No, thanks. I’ve seen too many rock stars go down that road. You 
remember my band, right?

EZRA	Dick Cancer.

PJ	Cock Tumor. We changed our name after college. Our sound had matured, so it made sense that 
we mature with it, you know? Go by Butthole Equinox now. Played Gato Loco last week, 
Wednesday. Place was packed. It was also half-off frozen margarita night, so, it’s tough to say what 
the big pull was. I sent you a link on Facebook though, didn’t I? I can make sure you’re added to the 
list.

EZRA	Don’t bother, bro. I blocked you. (grunts)

BOBBY	(quietly) Ow. Fuck.

SHEA	To old times?

BOBBY	(laughs) Yeah. Cheers.

BOBBY	(exhales) I did not think you’d come. I mean, this isn’t exactly (grunts) your kind of jam, roughing it. 
Falling asleep under the stars.

SHEA	Oh, fuck the stars. You should see the fairy lights in my tent.

KATO	Normally I’m a “bros before hos” kinda guy, but this one time I gotta cross the party line and ask, 
what the hell do you see in that guy? I mean, dead-end rock band. Dopey smile. You know, you 
were valedictorian. Now you’re graduating from M.I.T. I ain’t no genius, but that shit don’t compute.

RIAN	Weren’t you like, a huge drug dealer in college?

KATO	I grew out of it. I had the good sense to identify a bad habit and drop it.

RIAN	I need a refill.

KATO	Your drink’s almost full. (grunts)

RIAN	No it’s not. Dick head.

KATO	(exhales)

ERIN	(chuckles)

KATO	Something you wanna say?

PJ	Good night, Oregon!

EZRA	Hey, when are you opening for Cold Play?

PJ	Yeah.

KATO	Fuck this.

SHEA/BOBBY	(moaning...)

KATO	Jesus. Can’t tell if they’re fucking or performing an exorcism.

SHEA/BOBBY	(moaning...)

BOBBY	Come on, I’m gonna blow! I’m gonna blow.

SHEA	(overlapping) (moaning) Almost there, Bobby. Almost there--  

BOBBY	(overlapping) (moaning)

SHEA	What the fuck, Bobby!

EZRA	(overlapping) Come on, Cici. I told you nothing happened. Trust me, okay? What’s the point of us 
being out here if you’re gonna treat me this way, huh?

EZRA	Fine. Fuck. Whatever.

RIAN	All right, rock star, are you ready for something different?

PJ	Those real?

RIAN	They’re my dad’s.

PJ	That is disgusting. That is gross.

RIAN	(overlapping) Oh, no. They’re my dad’s department-issued cuffs.

PJ	(overlapping) Oh.

RIAN	(overlapping) So they’re legit.

PJ	Let’s get kinky.

RIAN	(moans)

PJ	Ow, ow, ow ow. Got caught on my skin.

RIAN	(overlapping) (grunts) Oh, I am sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

PJ	Oh, ow.

RIAN	(overlapping) I’m- I’m sorry. (laughs) I was trying to be cool.

PJ	How many times do I have to tell you, I’m the cool one in this relationship? I’m the rock star. You’re 
the smart one. Never forget that. Now get over here. What?

RIAN	Nothing.

PJ	Come on, say it.

RIAN	You seem really happy.

PJ	I’m just really excited for tomorrow.

RIAN	(laughs) Since when do you care about football?

SHEA	So, how ‘bout by the time we’re thirty-five, we get married.

BOBBY	What? (laughs) Um, let’s- let’s make it forty, okay? (laughs)

SHEA	Done deal.

BOBBY	Hey. Good work tonight. Jesus, I, I gotta go. Hold on. Fuck, I’m starving.

ERIN	(gasps)

ERIN	Fuck! Oh, shit. (grunting) (breathes heavily)

CLOAKED MAN/MR. PETERSON	Turn the fuck around, Erin. Don’t look at me. Get down!

ERIN	(overlapping) (gasping) (crying)

CLOAKED MAN/MR. PETERSON	Don’t you fuckin’ look at me. Are you alone? Speak up.

ERIN	Yes.

CLOAKED MAN/MR. PETERSON	Is everyone sleeping, hm?

ERIN	I think so.

CLOAKED MAN/MR. PETERSON	Has anybody seen me?

ERIN	No. (cries)

CLOAKED MAN/MR. PETERSON	Okay, good. That’s good. Okay. Turn around.

ERIN	(cries) Please, let me go. I haven’t seen your face.

CLOAKED MAN/MR. PETERSON	Shut your eyes.

ERIN	You don’t have to do this. Please.

CLOAKED MAN/MR. PETERSON	Close your eyes.

ERIN	Please!

CLOAKED MAN/MR. PETERSON	I’m so sorry. (grunts)

ERIN	(grunts) (breathes heavily) Rian. Rian, wake up. Rian.

RIAN	What’s going on?

ERIN	I don’t know.

PJ	(coughs)

RIAN	We were gassed. (grunts) What the hell are these?

ERIN	I have no fucking idea.

RIAN	(modified) Babe?

PJ	(modified) (mumbles)

AMBER	(modified) Kato, are you-- 

SHEA	(modified) Oh, my fucking god! What’s going on here?

CICI	(modified) Our cars! They’re gone.

ERIN	(breathes heavily)

SHEA	(modified) Bobby! (normally) Where the fuck are you!

CICI	Does everyone have these vests?

MR. PETERSON	(overlapping) Shut the fuck up.

AMBER	(gasps) What the fuck is going on he--  

MR. PETERSON	(overlapping) Jesus, you’re all so annoying.

RIAN	Mr. Peterson?

MR. PETERSON	Rian. It’ so good to see you again, though I do wish it was under better circumstances.

CICI	My head hurts.

MR. PETERSON	That’s from the Halothane.

PJ	What is that?

RIAN	Sleeping gas.

AMBER	Fuck.

MR. PETERSON	It’s been a long time since I taught all of you.

ERIN	(whimpers)

MR. PETERSON	Tonight’s your final lesson.

RIAN	This isn’t funny!

PJ	Don’t. Don’t.

MR. PETERSON	It’s not supposed to be funny.

SHEA	Where the fuck is Bobby, you fucking weirdo.

PJ	(overlapping) Cut this shit off.

MR. PETERSON	Don’t you worry about Bobby. You’ll hear from him soon enough.

RIAN	(overlapping) (grunts)

MR. PETERSON	(overlapping) Paul. That’s not coming off. Trust me.

PJ	(grunts)

MR. PETERSON	(overlapping) That’s industrial grade cabling. Save your energy. You’re gonna need it for later.

EZRA	What the fuck is going on!

MR. PETERSON	Get back! Get the fuck back!

EZRA	All right! All right! Just put it down. We can talk, man. Whatever’s going on, we can talk. Please, 
man. (breathes heavily)

MR. PETERSON	You’ve all gone on with your lives. Moved on as if nothing ever happened.

ERIN	(cries)

MR. PETERSON	Reckless? Yes. Entitled? Most definitely. Desensitized. That’s what all of you are. Erin. (sighs) I’m 
so sorry to drag you into this. You were always such a sweet girl.

ERIN	(overlapping) (whimpers)

MR. PETERSON	But I can’t leave anyone out of this.

ERIN	Is this about Caleb?

MR. PETERSON	No. This is about all of you!

KATO	We all graduated high school, man. We don’t need your science class problem solving bullshit! 
What the hell is this about?

MR. PETERSON	Tonight, you’re gonna find out just how good of friends you really are.

SHEA	What is that? 

KATO	What is that?

EZRA	Wait, what the fuck?

CICI	(overlapping) What the fuck- what the fuck is this!

ERIN	(whimpering)

SHEA	(gasps)

RIAN	(gasps)

PJ	Is this like, laser tag?

MR. PETERSON	I watched my son die. And then I watched my wife dose herself into suicide.

RIAN	(cries) He’s crazy.

MR. PETERSON	Time with my family was- was taken from me. Time. Only once it’s been stolen from you can you 
truly appreciate what a precious resource it really is. So precious in fact that, only one of you will 
leave these woods alive tonight. The one with the most time.

ERIN	(overlapping) What the fuck?

KATO	What the fuck?

GROUP	(groans...)

SHEA	Holy shit!

KATO	(overlapping) Oh! Fuckin’ hard core!

RIAN	(overlapping) (breathes heavily)

PJ	Rian, what are you doing? Get back! You’re gonna get brains all over yourself.

RIAN	(overlapping) (groans)

PJ	See this? This is why I was never allowed to sleep over at Caleb’s house.

SHEA	Why would he do that? Why would he do that in front of us?

RIAN	(overlapping) (breathing heavily)

EZRA	(overlapping) He was always fuckin’ weird, man. Just like his kid.

RIAN	(overlapping) Found our phones. (gasps)

EZRA	Then call the fuckin’ cops, brainiac.

RIAN	Good luck with that.

AMBER	Fuck, the one time I don’t get insurance.

RIAN	(overlapping) (breathes heavily)

ERIN	Guys. They’re timers.

ERIN	And they’re set.

CICI	This sucks.

AMBER	I don’t like this.

KATO	Now I know I had too much to drink, ‘cause I’m in the middle of a dream where my high school 
science teacher stitched my ass into a metal vest, downloaded all the Saw movies, bitched about 
millennials for a hot second, then blew his fucking brains out.

PJ	Well look, they’re green. Green’s a positive, happy color, right? Hey, Shea’s got a blue one.

SHEA	(gasps)

PJ	I want a blue one.

RIAN	(overlapping) ‘Cause she’s got the most time.

KATO	What the fuck does that mean, Miss M.I.T.?

ERIN	We can figure this out.

EZRA	Will we, Erin? What do you think happens when that timer hits zero, Erin? Generally speaking, 
unless I’m fuckin’ watchin’ a rocket launch...

RIAN	(overlapping) (breathes heavily) Shit.

EZRA	or heating up a burrito in a fuckin’ microwave, countdown timers are a bad fuckin’ thing!
CICI	Get this thing off of me!

PJ	Peterson said it was pointless.

CICI	I don’t care, just get it off.

PJ	Okay. Um-- 

ERIN	(crying)

PJ	I think I know a way how, but I’d have to chop off your arms and your head to do it.

CICI	Shut up, PJ!

EZRA	No, he’s fucking right. These things are airtight.

SHEA	Where the fuck is Bobby!

RIAN	The last thing we need is Bobby.

SHEA	And why the fuck not, Miss Know-It-All?

RIAN	Bobby sold us out. He worked with Peterson to get us here.

SHEA	No.

RIAN	Think about it, Shea. How does one man transport all of our cars out of the woods alone, gas us 
all? He doesn’t. Bobby helped him!

EZRA	No, Bobby would never do that.

CICI	Are you sure?

EZRA	(overlapping) Yeah, I’m fuckin’ sure.

CICI	It was mysteriously Bobby’s idea to come out here in the first place.

ERIN	(breathing heavily)

CICI	Bobby knew a place we could stay for free. Bobby and Mr. Peterson made a deal to trap us out 
here for whatever crazy, messed-up game this is.

SHEA	Where is he?

RIAN	We don’t need Bobby. What we need is a car! Fuck. Okay. Okay, all right. Mr. Peterson didn’t drive 
the last car out of here then walk back. There has to be a car around here somewhere. We need to 
find it and get back to civilization.

EZRA	All right, let’s fuckin’ move then. Go! Go! Go!

RIAN	Come on, PJ.

KATO	Come on. Let’s go up this way. Amber, pass the flashlight.

EZRA	Yo, Cici? Let’s check back here.

CICI	I think I’m gonna go with my friends. Let’s go, Kato.

RIAN	Just yell if you see anything.

KATO	No shit, Sherlock.

AMBER	This is the worst reunion ever!

EZRA	(overlapping) Shit.

RIAN	Something’s not right. The longer we wait around, the worse it’s gonna get.

PJ	Has anyone seen anything?

RIAN	They’ve gotta be close, guys.

PJ	Shea, come on.

SHEA	(gasping)

EZRA	(groans) Oh.

EZRA	Oh, fucking, come on. (breathes heavily)

KATO	There’s nothing here.

AMBER	Why would Peterson do this?

KATO	We all know why he’s doing it. Just don’t exactly know what he’s done.

EZRA	There’s fuck-all out here!

BOBBY	(groaning)

EZRA	Bobby? Guys! Hey, guys, come here! Over here!

EZRA	(muffled) (indistinct...)

RIAN	(breathing heavily) This way! Guys, come quick!

PJ	We better get some fucking answers. Shea, come on.

KATO	Amber, hurry up.

EZRA	(indistinct)

AMBER	(overlapping) (grunts) Kato, wait.

EZRA	We’re here!

SHEA	Oh my god, Bobby, are you okay?

BOBBY	Get the fuckin’ crowbar. Get the fuckin’ crowbar! Break this fuckin’ lock!

EZRA	(overlapping) Why is there a fuckin’ crowbar there, Bobby?

BOBBY	(overlapping) Please! I don’t have time! Please, just hurry, okay? Jesus.

SHEA	(overlapping) Somebody help me.

RIAN	What are you doing?

SHEA	I’m gonna get Bobby out.

RIAN	What the fuck, Shea? Bobby’s obviously working with Peterson. He helped get us here! Why would 
you let him out?

SHEA	We just found him chained to a tree with the shit kicked out of him, Rian! That doesn’t exactly 
scream “accomplice” to me.

BOBBY	Help, please!

CICI	You’re being crazy, Shea! You need to think!

RIAN	It’s a very basic situation. Bobby is not on our side.

BOBBY	Fuck! Okay. Okay. He made me do it. He made me do it. Just please, just- just- just get me out of 
this and I’ll explain everything, okay?

CICI	How exactly does someone make another person drag eight of their friends out into the woods to 
watch his suicide?

RIAN	Like I said, if I were to posit--  

EZRA	Posit? Fuckin’ posit? Words like that are why people fuckin’ hate you.

RIAN	(overlapping) Oh, people hate me?

EZRA	Yeah. I fuckin’ hate you.

KATO	Yeah, go do algebra somewhere.

PJ	(overlapping) Whoa, let’s take it easy, guys.

EZRA	Shut the fuck up.

RIAN	He was willingly helping Mr. Peterson. There’s no other feasible explanation.

SHEA	So we just leave him chained to a fucking tree?

BOBBY	I’m- (clears throat) I’m gay.

AMBER	Are you serious?

RIAN	(overlapping) What?

BOBBY	(overlapping) Okay. I’m- I’m gay every now and again.

SHEA	What do you mean, “You’re gay every now and then, Bobby?”

KATO	Like, part-time gay?

BOBBY	I’m bi. I’m bisexual.

EZRA	Thank god I didn’t share a fuckin’ tent with him.

BOBBY	Fuck you, Ezra!

EZRA	(overlapping) No, fuck you, Bobby!

BOBBY	Fuck you, man!

EZRA	No-fucking-thank-you.

BOBBY	Peterson knew! I, I confided in him, in high school. And now that sick fuck took photos of me at 
some club one month ago. And he- he threatened to release the pictures- it would ruin my life- 
unless I dr- dragged all you guys out here. Okay? And I did not know that anything fucked up was 
going on until he showed up with a gun. He said that he wanted closure for Caleb’s death. He 
wanted to reminisce about old memories or some bullshit like that. He knocked me out while he 
was gassing our tents. He’s the one who beat the shit out of me, okay?

KATO	What a fucking homophobe.

AMBER	Seriously, Kato?

BOBBY	My job is everything to me.

BOBBY	(overlapping) Okay, like, the only reason I’m doing so well at work is ‘cause- ‘cause my boss, Mrs. 
Rowe, she wants to fuck me. Okay?

RIAN	(overlapping) Fuck, dude.

BOBBY	(overlapping) Right? She’s not gonna wanna fuck a faggot, so here we are. And I’m sorry but I 
didn’t know anyone was gonna get hurt.

ERIN	(whimpers)

RIAN	What happens when these timers hit zero, huh?

BOBBY	Just take it easy.

EZRA	What do you mean, “get hurt?”

BOBBY	Hold-hold-hold-hold. He didn’t tell you the rules?

AMBER	What rules, Bobby?

BOBBY	Let’s just take it down, okay? Just let me out and I’ll explain everything. It’s really simple, actually. 
Come on, baby, yeah. Come on, please-please-please-please-please. What the fuck?

SHEA	Come on, guys. What are we supposed to do here? He’s our friend.

BOBBY	Yeah, thank you guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Okay, yeah.

EZRA	Watch your feet.

BOBBY	(overlapping) In the back.

EZRA	(grunts)

BOBBY	(overlapping) (unintelligible) Oh my god. Yeah. Yes! Thank you.

EZRA	Alright.

BOBBY	Thank you. At least some of you have fuckin’ souls.

CICI	He has something behind his back!

BOBBY	(mumbles)

EZRA	(overlapping) Bobby, why have you got a fuckin’ knife, dude!

SHEA	What’re you doing, Bobby?

BOBBY	He gave this to me, okay, ‘cause I’ve got the least amount of time. And now I am gonna stab that 
piece of shit right there. Get over here, Kato!

KATO	What the fuck, Bobby?

SHEA	(overlapping) We’re your friends. Why are you doing this?

BOBBY	Oh, please. Seriously, why do you think any of us ever hang out, huh? Huh? It’s because of Caleb. 
And he is gone. So don’t you tell me that we are fuckin’ friends. We are not fuckin’ friends.

SHEA	Bobby, you’re out of time.

EZRA	(overlapping) Shit.

BOBBY	Oh, fuck me and my asshole. 

BOBBY	I’m sorry!

KATO	Amber, here, come on.

PJ	(breathes heavily) (grunts)

SHEA	(vomits) Rian.

EZRA	(grunts) Uh, god. Here, take my hand.

CICI	I don’t want your help, Ezra.

RIAN	No-no, guys! Guys! Guys, stop!

PJ	Help!

RIAN	PJ, where are you? Guys, you gotta come back.

PJ	Rian-- 

EZRA	Cici, wait up.

CICI	Leave me alone, Ezra.

EZRA	Just talk to me.

CICI	You wanna talk? Let’s talk. She’s here tonight, isn’t she? The girl you’re sleeping with.

EZRA	I don’t know what to tell you. I didn’t cheat on you. I would never hurt you. Come on, Cici, what do I 
have to do to prove myself to you? We’re in the middle of the fucking woods with bombs strapped 
to our fucking chests. I am asking you to trust me.

CICI	You’re a cheat! You use women and you discard them. And when you’re done with them, that’s all 
you ever say. “Trust me. You can trust me.” People that you can actually trust don’t have to 
convince you of it all the time.

EZRA	Okay, this night is already so fucked up. Can we just- just figure out how to get out of here? Then 
we can talk, we can do whatever. Let’s just get out of here first, please, babe. You’ve got thirty 
minutes. I’ve got forty. Let’s use this time to figure this out. Come on, babe, please.

CICI	I wish I had more time.

EZRA	We all do.

CICI	So I can watch you die in front of me.

EZRA	(sighs) Fuck. Fuck me.

AMBER	What the fuck did...

AMBER	he do? (breathes heavily)

KATO	(overlapping) I don’t know. Doesn’t look like we got a lot of choice. Peterson said the only one to 
get out of here alive is the one with the most amount of time. That’s Shea. But why her? Whose 
dick did she suck to get more time?

AMBER	Uh, why the fuck would Bobby act like that?

KATO	Guy was a closet gay. Maybe he was just very, very frustrated. Look on the bright side. At least 
now we know what happens when these timers hit zero.

AMBER	Wait. That doesn’t seem fair. So the rest of us have gotta wait to blow up? Kato, who’s next? Who’s 
got the least amount of time?

CICI	Guys...

CICI	where are you? 

PJ	Oh, sh-- (softly) Guys?

CICI	Guys, where are you?

PJ	(gasps)

PJ	Stay purple- stay green! Stay green! Stay green! Shit. Rian!

EZRA	Oh, fuckin’ Bobby. (breathes heavily) (sighs) That’s not gonna heal. (grunts) Oh, god. Oh, what’s 
this? Come on. (grunts) Fuck. (grunts)

SHEA	Oh, shit. (breathes heavily) Where are you guys? Where the fuck are you guys? (grunts)

PJ	Rian? Rian? 

RIAN	(overlapping) I’m here, PJ!

PJ	Rian, I’m- I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do. I’m about to blow up, babe. I want the green lights to 
come back. Uh, what do I do? Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do.

RIAN	(overlapping) Uh, I don’t know. I don’t know.

PJ	You don’t know? You- you gotta know what to do. You always know what to do. Say something 
clever!

RIAN	(overlapping) I’m sorry, PJ. I don’t know what to do. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

PJ	(overlapping) (cries) I don’t want to die. I don’t wanna die. Please. Please, no, you gotta get away 
from me.

RIAN	(overlapping) No. No-no-no, PJ, no! No.

PJ	(overlapping) (unintelligible) No-no, no, I can’t be around you. No-no-no, get away from me. I don’t 
want you to be around me when this thing goes off.

RIAN	(overlapping) No, we can figure this out PJ. (crying)

PJ	Go away. Go--  

SHEA	(overlapping) Hey, guys.

PJ	(grunts)

SHEA	(grunts)

PJ	(gasps) Oh, that is a lot of blood.

RIAN	(screams)

KATO	That wasn’t an explosion.

AMBER	Well then, what happened?

KATO	Come on.

PJ	(breathing heavily) Oh m--  

SHEA	(grunts)

RIAN	(whimpering)

PJ	(overlapping) What the fuck have I done! (cries)

RIAN	No, come on. (grunts)

PJ	(overlapping) She came out of nowhere. Rian, you gotta believe me.

RIAN	No-no-no-no-no. Shea? (gasps) Oh, fuck. Oh, no.

PJ	(overlapping) (cries)

RIAN	She’s dead. (cries)

PJ	(overlapping) I didn’t- I didn’t see her come up behind me.

RIAN	Don’t do this to yourself.

PJ	(crying) She’s dead. Fuckin’ dead.

RIAN	(overlapping) Stop right now. Hey. Hey, PJ! We have to get out of here.

PJ	(cries) I, I can’t fuckin’ leave her.

RIAN	(overlapping) She’s dead, PJ.

PJ	I can’t leave her like that.

RIAN	(overlapping) Come on, PJ, we have to find the others.

EZRA	(grunts) Where are you! (grunts)

KATO	This way.

AMBER	What was that?

KATO	They’re over there.

AMBER	Oh, just what the fuck is happening?

EZRA	Holy shit, Pauls, what the fuck just happened?

KATO	Dude, what the fuck?

RIAN	It’s Shea.

AMBER	We heard a scream. Wha- was that Shea?

RIAN	No, that was me.

AMBER	Are you okay? What happened?

KATO	What’s going on? Why is there blood on your face, PJ? You run into a tree?

ERIN	Hey, guys.

KATO	Fuck. Even your footsteps are quiet.

AMBER	Sorry, where- where’s Cici?

KATO	What’s going on here, guys?

EZRA	She told me to get fucked and ran off.

KATO	Hey drummer boy, whose blood is that?

AMBER	Where- where’s Shea, PJ?

PJ	That’s what I’m trying to tell you. Um, she-- 

RIAN	Something happened to her.

EZRA	What? What the fuck happened, PJ?

RIAN	She’s dead.

EZRA	What the fuck did you do to her?

PJ	It was an accident, man. She came up behind me, I got a fright, I spun around and I hit her, right in 
the head with my flashlight. I hit her so fuckin’ hard, man.

EZRA	Jesus, dude.

PJ	It happened so fast. I’m so fuckin’ sorry, guys. I’m so fuckin’ sorry. Thought I was gonna blow up. I 
thought I was gonna die. (cries) I’m so sorry.

ERIN	Why does he have more time, now?

KATO	Oh, fuck. Now PJ has more time than me.

EZRA	He’s got more time than everyone. He’s fuckin’ blue.

ERIN	Who’s got the least?

KATO	Oh, shit. You.

RIAN	Guys, we have to find our cars.

KATO	We don’t have time for that.

ERIN	We don’t have time for anything.

KATO	No. Fuck, we’re all gonna die.

AMBER	Guys, I don’t wanna die.

RIAN	Well guys, give me a second here. Shea had over fifty minutes left when she died. PJ somehow 
inherited her time. It makes sense, now. This- this is what Peterson was getting at, why- why Bobby 
had the knife, why he wanted to kill you, Kato.

EZRA	Oh, what the fuck are you talking about?

RIAN	We can steal each other’s time to stay alive. Shea had fifty-three minutes left on her timer when 
she- when she was-- 

EZRA	What, murdered?

PJ	(cries) Man, take it easy.

EZRA	Oh, come on. Fuckin’ say it like it is.

RIAN	PJ inherited her remaining time.

KATO	But how? Why’d PJ get the time?

RIAN	There must be sensors in here, have- to read-- I, I don’t know. Uh, heartbeats, body heat, could be 
anything. Closest person near someone who dies must get the time. Proximity sensors.

ERIN	Why- but, why would Peterson program the vests to do that?

RIAN	To incentivize us.

EZRA	To incentivize us to do what, exactly?

RIAN	To kill each other

RIAN	The only way to stay alive is to take each other’s time.

CICI	(overlapping) (breathing heavily)

KATO	So the more you kill, the more time you get.

RIAN	Seems to be the high-level summary.

ERIN	Why would Peterson do something so evil?

EZRA	The fucker’s obviously off his rockers. Thinks we had something to do with his son fuckin’ OD’ing.

PJ	We were all there that night.

AMBER	That doesn’t make any fucking sense. If he was so pissed that his son was dead and we were all 
alive, then why didn’t he just kill us and get it all over with?

KATO	That’s fucking typical Peterson. A convoluted, over-the-top lesson when a bullet to each of our 
heads would’ve sufficed. (breathes heavily) He’s the same dick-head teacher he was five years 
ago.

RIAN	Joke’s on him. I mean, no one here is capable of murdering anyone else. Right?

EZRA	(laughs) Oh, no-no, no-no-no. Don’t try and fucking manipulate me like that. Don’t fucking try. No, 
I’m not gonna wait around here and be killed, not after your fucking boyfriend has gone all Lord of 
the Fucking Flies on one of our friends.

PJ	Back up, bro. I said it was an accident.

EZRA	And what happens when there’s another “accident”, bro?

AMBER	Just put the crowbar down.

EZRA	No, I think I’m gonna hold onto it, thanks.

RIAN	We’re dead if we let our emotions rule us.

AMBER	We’re all dead, no matter what. Peterson said that only one of us gets to survive. That means 
whoever has the most time. I.E., your fucking deadbeat boyfriend.

PJ	Deadbeat? Hey, fuck you.

RIAN	Come on, take it easy. We have to work together.

KATO	Yeah. Ask Shea how that worked out for her.

EZRA	Shut the fuck up, Kato.

AMBER	Look, we’re either all with each other or-- 

KATO	(overlapping) No. It’s every man for himself.

AMBER	And woman.

EZRA	Oh, for fuck’s sake.

KATO	No, shit. You  knew exactly what I meant. Now isn’t the time to be a bitch. We need to strategize.

RIAN	Strategize? You’re thinking strategy? Like, how to kill us all?

KATO	I’m thinking how not to die. Pretty soon, everyone here is gonna be doing the exact same thing. 
Some people are getting edgy, trying to get a head start on the game. Some people are collecting 
weapons.

EZRA	Weapons? (laughs) No, this is a fucking tool, you tool. This is to get this shit off.

RIAN	PJ, we should get out of here.

PJ	Okay.

EZRA	Oh, yeah, of course. Of fucking course, take your blue-vested boyfriend and get the fuck out of 
here. Protect him from reality like you did back in fuckin’ high school.

RIAN	We can’t just sit here and wait this out, Ezra. Time is a precious resource right now, and I’m not 
gonna wait around to try and convince you. It’s crazy. We have to try and get help.

ERIN	(softly) It’s better if we-- 

KATO	(overlapping) Oh, for fuck’s sake, speak up. Better if we what?

ERIN	We’re away from each other. So that another-- No one else gets hurt.

KATO	You know, you kept your mouth shut for so long, I really thought you’d come up with something 
better than that by now.

EZRA	Hey, no. She’s fuckin’ right, dude. No one here knows what they’re gonna do when they have thirty 
seconds left.

PJ	Dude, in horror movies, when people split up, that’s right before they die.

EZRA	Well, yeah, but in horror movies, the fuckin’ bad guy isn’t, you know, all the good guys.

KATO	That’s it. We all just go our separate ways.

CICI	(overlapping) (grunts) (screams)

PJ	Whoa! Just run, Rian!

RIAN	(breathing heavily)

EZRA	(grunts)

KATO	Fuckin’ psycho!

CICI	(whimpers)

KATO	Run, Amber! You’re gonna get us killed. Come on!

AMBER	(overlapping) This is not a situation. And you too, Kato!

EZRA	(grunts) Oh, for fuck’s sake. Where the fuck are you guys?

CICI	(crying)

AMBER	Wait up, Kato. This thing is heavy!

KATO	(grunts) Down here.

AMBER	(grunts)

KATO	Come on. We have to get to it before anyone else does.

PJ	(grunts)

RIAN	(breathes heavily) 

PJ	I think we’re safe.

RIAN	Right now, you’re the biggest target. If anyone wants to play the game, they’ll come after the person 
with the most time. So no PJ, we’re not safe.

PJ	I’m an endangered species.

RIAN	Look at me. We’re not dying here tonight. Not here in these woods like this.

PJ	Okay.

RIAN	Let’s go.

CICI	(whimpering)

KATO	It’s not here. Peterson’s gun is missing.

AMBER	What does- what does that mean?

KATO	It means that someone out here really wants to win, already.

AMBER	I don’t know if I can do it. I, I don’t think I could kill someone, let alone my best friend.

KATO	Wake up, Amber. You saw how we all scattered like cockroaches the second we faced a flicker of 
adversity. None of us are really friends anymore. We can’t trust anyone. We have to get out of here.

AMBER	And go where?

EZRA	Erin, is that you? Hey. You okay?

ERIN	(overlapping) (grunts) (breathing heavily) Get back! You should go and find Cici. She needs you.

EZRA	Cici thinks I cheated on her. Uh, she wanted to kill me long before she had a bomb strapped to her 
chest.

ERIN	(breathes heavily)

EZRA	No, come on. Wait. Please. No, come on, come back. Look, I don’t know what’s gonna happen 
tonight, okay? But everyone else seems  to have their teammates, except us. We were left out.


ERIN	What’re you saying? I need you to look out for me?

EZRA	No. I’m saying that you need a partner and I need a partner. (exhales) You know, someone to- well, 
you know.

ERIN	You just wanna keep me around, ‘cause you think I’m an easy kill. Like life insurance for when 
you’ve run out of time.

EZRA	Don’t think like that, please. I’m not gonna be able to do anything when the time comes. Hell, I can 
even eat gluten. Trust me, I’m not gonna be able to kill anyone.

ERIN	Why should I trust you? Your girlfriend doesn’t. You don’t even know my last name.

EZRA	Erin, come on.

ERIN	We’ve been in the same group of friends for over five years now, and you know nothing about me. I 
think this is the longest we’ve ever spoken.

EZRA	I didn’t cheat on Cici. Alright, she’s paranoid. Alright, now no one can be around someone who’s 
happy to assume the worst of others. You get that, right? I can’t be around someone who’s looking 
for permission to kill me. (breathes heavily) Besides, I have more time than you. So you’re gonna 
come after me way before I come after you. And it’s Coleman. Your last name is Coleman.

ERIN	Fine.

EZRA	Fine, we’re good?

ERIN	Yeah.

EZRA	Okay. Let’s go.

ERIN	Where, Ezra?

EZRA	To the next camp. Maybe they’ve got a car?

ERIN	How many people did we pass on the way here? It’s like Bobby said. Everyone’s in town for the big 
game tomorrow. We’re the only idiots camping out here, and it’s at least thirty miles back to town. 
We won’t make it.

EZRA	Well, maybe they got a ranger station or something out here, right? We have to find someone who 
can help us. Let’s just get to the road and we’ll figure it out from there. Come on. Come on, Erin.

RIAN	We just need to survive long enough until help gets here.

PJ	How are we gonna get help? In an hour we’re all forest confetti and all of our phones are gone.

RIAN	Do you think my dad would let me be away from him for a whole weekend in the deep, dark woods 
with just one cell phone?

PJ	I love your dad.

CICI	(whimpering) Ezra! I’m sorry.

EZRA	I have no fucking idea where to go. Do you? Something must’ve pushed Peterson off the edge. Did 
he say anything to you? Did you speak to him after the funeral? Why is he fucking with us now?

PJ	Okay. Where we lookin’?

RIAN	One of the big ones. (grunts)

PJ	Come on, baby. Come on.

RIAN	(breathing heavily) It’s gotta be here.

CICI	(whimpering)

PJ	You sure you packed it?

RIAN	I wouldn’t make a stupid mistake like that. It must be here. My dad even handed it to me. He made 
sure it was charged and everything. Keep looking, PJ.

PJ	(overlapping) Yes. I don’t know, maybe Peterson took it. Dickhead thought of everything else. 
(sighs)

RIAN	Oh.

PJ	Make sure you check the bottoms. Make sure you check the whole bag.

RIAN	Here, PJ, try this one.

PJ	Yeah, got it. Oh my god. (mumbles) Come on. Shit. (clears throat) I got nothing, babe. (grunts)

RIAN	(overlapping) Stop. Stop.

CICI	Please, Ezra, where are you?

RIAN	(overlapping) You hear that?

CICI	I don’t wanna die alone.

PJ	We should try and help her, right? Maybe unscrew the vest with my knife.

RIAN	Oh, we can’t.

PJ	What? Rian, she’s our friend. Do you really--  

RIAN	(overlapping) Sh.

CICI	Ezra. Where are you?

RIAN	(whispers) Keep looking, PJ.

PJ	Okay.

CICI	Where is it?

PJ	(grunts) Shit.

RIAN	Sh.

CICI	(grunts)

CICI	Come on. Come on. Come on. (breathes heavily) What’s this? No. Oh. (breathes heavily) (grunts)

PJ	(groans)

KATO	Stop complaining.

AMBER	Fuck off.

CICI	(gasps)

CICI	(groans)

RIAN	She’s gone.

RIAN	Any service?

PJ	Nada.

RIAN	Okay. Let’s get out of this valley.

PJ	Yeah.

RIAN	Oh, PJ, come on!

PJ	Hold on a second. Oh, yeah.

RIAN	What the fuck are you doing?

PJ	If we have it, no one else does, right?

RIAN	Let’s just go, please.

EZRA	Were you always like this, so closed off, or is that something that happened after Caleb died? It 
was my party where he had his heart attack. I tried to revive him but-- Seriously, you’re not gonna 
respond to that? Come on, you can’t keep all of that bottled up. It’s not good for you.

ERIN	To you, Caleb was the quiet smart kid who you maybe copied off of.

EZRA	Are you kidding me? That guy was in Advanced Placement classes. I was like, one notch above 
Special Ed.

RIN	Caleb was my boyfriend, Ezra. He was the first boy I was ever with. And the last. So yeah, it 
affected me.

EZRA	You know, there’s no shame in talking about it. Or admitting that it changed you. ‘Cause it changed 
me. Watching someone so smart and caring with a future that was so promising, poof, gone in an 
instant. It flipped a switch in me, made me realize that there’s no points for doing the right thing. 
People are shit, and they do shitty things, okay? If you’re not a user you’re probably being used.

ERIN	You’re just as pathetic as me. This loner rebel bullshit routine of yours, so forced and fake. Come 
on.

KATO	Erin would probably be the easiest. Wouldn’t even cry for help.

AMBER	Yeah but, who deserves it the most?

KATO	Oh, that goes without saying.

AMBER	(overlapping) Oh, who? What are you saying?

PJ	I guess I’ve never really trusted Kato, you know? One time I saw the guy put ice in milk, Rian. Ice in 
milk.

RIAN	There’s still no service. We gotta go higher. (grunts)

KATO	Oh, fuck. Your psychotic best friend’s been here.

AMBER	Cici? You here, babe? I don’t like this. Let’s get out of here.

CICI	Hey, weirdo!

KATO	(groans...)

AMBER	(overlapping) (screams)

CICI	(overlapping) (grunts)

AMBER	What’re you doing!

CICI	Back off, Amber!

KATO	(overlapping) (breathing heavily...)

CICI	I don’t wanna hurt you. But I’ve gotta kill him.

AMBER	This is not cool, Cici! This is not how best friends treat each other!

KATO	No! (grunts)

CICI	(grunts)

KATO	(overlapping) Why aren’t you with Ezra? (grunts)

CICI	It’s complicated. It’s either you or Amber.

AMBER	(cries)

CICI	I don’t wanna kill my best friend.

KATO	We can help you. We can help you find Ezra, together. And help you get his time. You should 
survive. Not him.

AMBER	No. She’ll never make it in time.

KATO	Oh, Jesus Christ, Amber. Seriously?

CICI	Rules are rules! I’m sorry.

KATO	(overlapping) Wait! Wait, Ezra was cheating on you!

CICI	No.

KATO	Yeah, yeah-yeah. But he was- but he was cheating on you with Amber. Oh, yeah. Plot twist.

CIC	What!

AMBER	No! (gasps) He’s- he’s lying! I would- I would never fuck your boyfriend, Cici.

KATO	It’s true. I went through her phone the other day. They were definitely fucking. They’ve been texting 
sweet nothings for weeks. He even sent her a dick pic. Average length. Kinda curved to the left. 
Terrible, terrible manscaping. I don’t know if it’s still going on.

CICI	Slut.

KATO	Last I saw, he accused her of giving him herpes.

AMBER	That’s insane! I don’t even have herpes!

KATO	Yeah you do. You got it from me.

AMBER	Fuck you!

KATO	And you gave it to Ezra.

CICI	And Ezra gave it to me, you bitch!

AMBER	(gasps)

CICI	I’ve been taking pills for months to get rid of this!

KATO	It’s a very, very resilient disease.

AMBER	Come on, you don’t wanna kill me.

CICI	Yes I do.

AMBER	That’s the herpes talking! Please! Please! No! I’m pregnant! Please. I’m pregnant, Cici. I’m gonna 
be a mom.

CICI	Bitch. No you ain’t. Yeah!

AMBER	(groans)

KATO	Oh, shit.

AMBER	(cries) (mumbles...)

CICI	(overlapping) I’m so sorry. Oh my-- Amber. What have I done?

KATO	(grunts...)

AMBER	(groans...)

CICI	(overlapping) Amber, I’m so sorry. What do I do? Is it in the ovaries? Are you-- I’m so sorry, Amber. 
Amber, I’m so sorry. Amber. Amber, I’m so s--  (gurgling...)

AMBER	(overlapping) (gasps) That is really, really intense. (gasps) Wait--  Fuck.

PJ	Any luck?

RIAN	Yeah. I got two bars.

PJ	Finally.

RIAN	(breathing heavily)

PJ	Whoa! Whoa!

RIAN	(overlapping) Whoa. Oh.

PJ	That’s not a good sign, right?

RIAN	(grunts)

AMBER	(breathing heavily)

ERIN	Oh, fuck! (gasps) Ezra!

EZRA	Shit. Someone’s dead. I didn’t hear an explosion, so.

ERIN	People are playing the game.

EZRA	Oh, fuck me.

KATO	Time to pop my murder cherry. (grunts) Cici! (grunts) Wait. What? You killed her?

AMBER	I did it. I did it. I, I k- I killed my best friend. I took all her time. That is next-level savage. I, I could 
actually win this thing.

KATO	You know to win this, you have to kill me, right?

AMBER	(whimpers) We- we’ve gotta do what we can to survive. That’s what you did. You- you left me alone 
with her to get the ax. You set Cici on me. You-- It’s cool. I know- I don’t blame you for what you 
did. You- you knew I could do it. I ju- I just needed a push. (inhales) The biggest mistake that 
people are gonna make is thinking that they have to wait until someone’s in the red to kill. We can 
jump all of them. We can get the most time. And then we can figure a way out of here. ‘Cause, 
there’s way too many nice people ignoring the very horrible game we’re being forced to play. So 
babe, who do we kill next?

RIAN	He’s still not picking up. (breathes heavily)

PJ	Well, try him again.

RIAN	Okay. (breathes heavily)

ERIN	Ezra, wait.

ERIN	Did you hear that? It’s coming from here.

EZRA	It’s nothing.

ERIN	Yeah, you’re probably right.

EZRA	No. No I’m not. (breathes heavily) Grow a fuckin’ backbone, I think you’re onto something. Let’s go.

ERIN	Seriously?

RIAN	Oh, no-no-no-no-no.

PJ	Maybe he’s just listening to that Cock Tumor EP I gave him for his birthday three years ago, and he 
just can’t hear the phone. Maybe he’s just a really deep sleeper.

RIAN	My dad sleeps with one eye open and the ringer on full blast, three feet from his head. Something’s 
not right. I’m going to track his phone.

PJ	Okay. Okay. And?

RIAN	It’s searching. It’s zoning in. PJ, let’s go!

PJ	What?

RIAN	It says it’s four hundred yards away over there!

PJ	Come on!

MR. MILLER	(groans)

EZRA	Erin. Erin, be careful.

MR. MILLER	Who’s that? Who the fuck is that? Help me. Help me, please. 

ERIN	(gasps)

EZRA	Holy shit.

ERIN	Mr. Miller? It’s me. It’s Erin. Are you okay?

MR. MILLER	Rian? Rian? Is Rian okay?

EZRA	Last we saw, she was in one piece, yeah.

MR. MILLER	Jesus Christ. He got all of you out here? (coughs) Help me out of this fuckin’ wire. Please, Erin, I 
don’t have a lot of time.

EZRA	Why has Peterson done this? What did we do to him?

MR. MILLER	Peterson is convinced his son’s death wasn’t natural.

ERIN	That’s crazy. Everyone knows Caleb had a heart condition.

MR. MILLER	That’s what I told him. So- so I closed the case. I thought it was over. I thought- I thought we could 
go on with our lives. He kept digging. Got his hookups at the university to run more fuck- fuckin’ 
blood tests. They discovered that Caleb had a lethal dose of speed in his system and that’s what 
cau- caused the heart attack.

EZRA	So, what, Caleb had a bum-ticker and accidentally did too much molly at my party? How does that 
justify putting us in these things?

MR. MILLER	Oh, no-no-no, you don’t understand. Caleb had five times the lethal does in his system. Peterson is 
convinced somebody was slipping it into his drink the entire night.

EZRA	So Caleb was poisoned by someone at my party?

ERIN	You’re saying someone in these woods is a cold-blooded murderer?

KATO	(grunting...)

KATO	Guys?

RIAN	(breathing heavily) (grunts)

PJ	Oh. Sh. (mumbles) You good?

RIAN	Yeah-yeah, I’m fine. (grunts) You hear that? Go! Quick, hide!

RIAN	(whispers) Who is it?

KATO	(grunts)

PJ	(whispers) It’s Kato.

RIAN	(whispers) Fuck. We’ve gotta run. (grunts)

KATO	(grunts)

RIAN	(grunts)

PJ	(overlapping) Go-go, go-go. Go, run. Go! Go! Go!

KATO	(grunts) Guys? Help.

RIAN	(grunting)

PJ	Rian, move!

RIAN	I’m coming!

KATO	(grunting) Guys, come on! We’re hurt real bad down here.

RIAN	(grunting)

PJ	This is ridiculous. (breathes heavily) I gotta go talk to him.

RIAN	No! Fuck, no!

PJ	Come on. He’s our friend. (breathes heavily) He’s not gonna do anything to us. And besides, he’s 
hurt.

RIAN	No-no-no-no.

PJ	(grunts) It’s Kato. He’s fucking scared of mosquitoes. I gotta try.

RIAN	(overlapping) (grunts) Babe, please!

PJ	Kato! I’m coming, bro. I don’t want any bullshit trouble, okay? Kato? 

PJ	Kato? Amber?

KATO	PJ, buddy, please.

PJ	Kato, where are you guys?

KATO	We gotta stick together, man.

PJ	Kato!

KATO	(overlapping) (grunts) (breathes heavily)

PJ	Kato!

KATO	(laughs) Right here, drummer boy.

PJ	What the hell, man? You’re not even triggered. You’re green.

KATO	Don’t hate the player, hate the game.

PJ	Oh, it’s perfectly acceptable to hate the player when the player’s being a total dick.

KATO	(laughs)

PJ	It doesn’t matter what Peterson wants us to do, man. This nightmare that we’ve woken up in, we 
gotta find a way out of here and we need to do it quick.

KATO	Oh, it’ll be over quick.

PJ	Whoa-whoa-whoa! (grunts)

KATO	(overlapping) (laughs) (grunts)

PJ	Stop it, man! Sonofabitch!

KATO	(groans) (cries)

PJ	Man, I’m so sorry. I didn’t see the leg. Are you okay?

KATO	Yeah. (screams)

PJ	(overlapping) Kato!

PJ	Fuck man, you’ve gone all Jason Bateman on me.

KATO	You mean Patrick Bateman, you idiot, from American Psycho. (grunts)

PJ	(overlapping) Well then who’s Jason Bateman?

KATO	He’s from Arrested Development. Jeez, you are an idiot, aren’t you? (grunts...)

PJ	(overlapping) (whispers) Patrick Bateman. 

KATO	(whispers) Fuck this. (screams)

KATO	Is that all you got, you hippie fuck? (grunts)

PJ	(overlapping) (grunts)

RIAN	(breathes heavily)

RIAN	What are you doing, Amber!

AMBER	(grunting)

RIAN	Leave us alone!

KATO	(grunts) Here we go.

PJ	Kato, please stop. Kato. (grunts)

AMBER	I’ve hated you since fucking grade school, you bitch!

AMBER	(screams) I’m gonna kill you!

KATO	Hold still!

PJ	No! Kato-Kato. No-no-no-no. No-no-no-no! (screams) (cries)

KATO	(overlapping) (grunting) Now that’s what I call a drum solo. (grunts)

RIAN	(whimpering) PJ! (grunting)

KATO	Time to level up.

PJ	I knew you were a fuckin’ psycho when you didn’t cry at the end of Terminator Two.

MR. MILLER	(groans)

EZRA	(overlapping) Almost there, almost there.

ERIN	(overlapping) No-no-no-no-no.

ERIN	(overlapping) Mr. Miller, please. Please.

MR. MILLER	(overlapping) (groans)

EZRA	(overlapping) (grunts)

ERIN	We have to get you back to camp. There’s a first aid kit there.

EZRA	He’s gonna need more than a first aid kit.

MR. MILLER	(groaning...)

ERIN	Let me help you.

EZRA	Oh, fuck. He’s crashing harder than bitcoin. 

KATO	(exhales) This is funny.

PJ	(groans)

KATO	When you kill someone with any other weapon, you’re just a regular old murderer. But as soon as 
you use an ax, you’re an ax murderer. Why is that, PJ?

PJ	Well, if I were to posit-- (grunts...)

KATO	(overlapping) (grunts) You sonofabitch! (grunts)

EZRA	Erin, you’re wasting the time you have left.

ERIN	When is doing the right thing a waste of time?

EZRA	You’re not gonna be much help to him if you’re around him in five minutes.

ERIN	(breathes heavily) Mr. Miller, where’s your phone?

MR. MILLER	It’s in there.

ERIN	I got it. I’ve got it. I’ll find help, okay?

KATO	Here piggy, piggy, piggy.

ERIN	Nine, one-one. (into phone) Hello? Oh, thank god. My name’s Erin Coleman. No, I can’t give you 
my location. Look, this is an emergency. Please, I need help.

MR. MILLER	(breathing heavily)

EZRA	Oh, shit.

MR. MILLER	(breathing heavily...)

EZRA	(overlapping) I’m sorry, man.

ERIN	Fuck. It’s dead. Do you know anything about the vests? How to disarm them?

MR. MILLER	The fucker had two controllers or- or detonators, one to tu- one to turn the bombs on, and one to 
(coughs)--

ERIN	To turn them off?

MR. MILLER	Yeah. Get those, find those. He had them on him when he tied me up. Erin.

ERIN	Yes?

MR. MILLER	(breathes heavily) Tell Rian- tell Rian that I-- 

ERIN	(gasps) No!

AMBER	(breathes heavily) Oh, for fuck’s sake.

ERIN	What the fuck are you doing! Why did you do that?

EZRA	He’s a dead man. His time was wasting away with him.

ERIN	(gasps) So you just killed him in cold blood, take his minutes for yourself? You wanna take my time, 
too?

EZRA	I didn’t take his time. I gave it to you. I made sure you were standing closest to the body. Take it. 
Take it! It’s almost fully loaded. Hold onto it and only use it if you have to. Do not give it to anyone! 
Think about numero uno for once. Stand up for yourself.

EZRA	You have the most time, now. (exhales) And a gun. You can survive this.

ERIN	I’m not playing this game, Ezra. I’m gonna find Rian. She might be able to save us all. No more 
bloodshed.

EZRA	Just stop with the wallflower shtick, all right? Make your voice heard. When the time is right, don’t 
be afraid to make a little noise.

ERIN	Where the fuck are you even going?

EZRA	I think I know who killed Caleb.

ERIN	(whimpers)

PJ	Rian? (grunts) Ri- Rian. Rian.

RIAN	(overlapping) Over here!

PJ	Rian.

RIAN	(overlapping) Oh, babe. Oh, what happened?

PJ	We gotta get outta here, okay?

RIAN	Okay. Well, where do we go?

PJ	Anywhere. Anywhere is fine! Anywhere!

RIAN	(overlapping) Okay, okay.

PJ	Let’s find your dad

EZRA	Kato!

PJ	Wait, where are we?

RIAN	I don’t know.

PJ	Didn’t we just come from- from here?

RIAN	I don’t know. It all looks the same.

PJ	You said you-- Okay. Okay. Let’s uh-- Oh, shit.

RIAN	Hey, Erin.

ERIN	Hey.

PJ	Hey. So spoiler alert. Kato and his girlfriend are psychopaths. They want everyone dead. Are you?

ERIN	No. What happened?

RIAN	He came after us. Went all crazy on PJ. Amber tried to kill me, too.

ERIN	You okay?

RIAN	For now. You got more time?

ERIN	Yeah. Um-- 

RIAN	Did you, like, kill-- 

ERIN	No, no, of course not!

RIAN	Okay. Thank god. My dad, we were tracking his phone. Bu- but it’s dead, now.

ERIN	We found him but he wasn’t gonna make it.

RIAN	What?

PJ	Wait. What?

RIAN	And did- did someone kill him? Where’s my father, Erin?

PJ	Why- why- why is your dad here? Why is he playing this game?

ERIN	Rian, he was bleeding out. He was stabbed, Rian.

RIAN	Who stabbed him?

ERIN	Ezra.

RIAN	Ezra killed my dad?

ERIN	No, Ezra was there with me. Peterson did. Peterson stabbed him and left him in the woods to bleed 
out. I was there when he died, Rian. That’s why I got his time. I swear, we were trying to help him. I 
swear. But he told us that Peterson had a detonator that controlled this vest.

RIAN	I’ve tried it. It doesn’t work! It doesn’t work!

ERIN	Your dad said he had another one. One that might deactivate them. Okay? That’s good, right?

PJ	Where is it, Erin?

ERIN	Um, I think your dad said it- it’s on Peterson’s body, back at the camp. Rian, I’m so sorry.

PJ	Rian. Ri, we can’t give up now. We can’t.

RIAN	(overlapping) (cries)

ERIN	I’m sorry.

RIAN	It’s- it’s not giving up, PJ. It’s called accepting reality. Maybe you should try to join me for once 
instead of living in fantasyland all the time!

RIAN	I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

PJ	(exhales) No, it’s o- it’s okay. It’s okay. Okay. Do- do you- do you wanna go see your dad?

ERIN	No, Rian, please, you don’t.

RIAN	(cries) Let’s figure this out first and- and then I’ll say goodbye if there’s time.

PJ	Yeah, he u- he’d expect that, you know, for you to save everybody, what’s left of us.

RIAN	Okay. You- you’re not coming with?

ERIN	If Kato’s gone nuts, I need to go help Ezra. I’ll meet you back at camp, okay?

RIAN	Okay. Be careful, Erin.

PJ	Let’s go. This place is gonna start sounding like a popcorn machine if this uh, doesn’t work.

KATO	(breathes heavily)

EZRA	(overlapping) Fuckin’ show yourself! Kato! You fuckin’ dickhead. I’m comin’ for you, you piece of 
shit! I know you always hated Caleb.

PJ	(grunts)

RIAN	PJ, this way! (grunts)

PJ	Hold on. (grunts)

RIAN	We gotta keep moving! We’re running out of time, PJ.

PJ	Just give me two seconds.

RIAN	Come on!

PJ	You know that I love you, right?

RIAN	Oh, I love you, too.

PJ	Okay, I just needed you to know that. There was a time when I thought I was gonna live forever and 
then Caleb died and it was like, I just hope that I outlive my parents. Now, now I’m not even gonna 
outlive fax machines. And look, I really, really wanted to do this in a better time and place, but, it’s 
gonna be game over soon, so I might as well do it now. I can’t die without asking you a very 
important question.

RIAN	No, babe. Not now. Let’s get out of this and- and you can do everything the way you planned, 
okay?

PJ	Okay. Just, can you please hold onto this for me, so- so that I don’t lose it?

RIAN	I will, just because I love it. But when everything’s back to normal, I want the going-down-on-one-
knee thing and everything. Okay?

PJ	Yeah.

RIAN	PJ.

PJ	Yeah?

RIAN	I was wrong. My favorite thing about you is how you dedicate your life to what you believe in. Your 
friends, your band, us. Don’t change.

EZRA	Kato! Kato!

KATO	‘Sup, bro?

EZRA	(grunts)

KATO	Got something you wanna get off your chest? Like that vest? Or maybe the fact that you fucked my 
girlfriend with that bushy pencil dick of yours.

EZRA	(whispers) Shit, he knows.

KATO	It’s called manscaping, bro. Read a G.Q. every once in a while. (chuckles)

EZRA	I know what you did to Caleb.

KATO	Fuck this.

EZRA	Oh, shit. (grunts)

KATO	(overlapping) (grunts) Who gives a fuck about Caleb?

EZRA	His dad, for one!

KATO	(grunts) So that’s what this is all about. Peterson thinks one of us killed Caleb, and you assume it 
was me!

EZRA	If the glove fits. You had a hard-on for Erin back in high school but she was with Caleb.

KATO	I always did like the quiet ones. I wanted to make ‘em scream.

EZRA	(grunts) You brought a metric shit-ton of Ecstasy to that party. Then made me swear to not say 
anything to the cops when they came asking questions. (grunts)

KATO	(grunts)

EZRA	You poisoned his drinks, didn’t you? (grunts)

KATO	That’s quite the story, Ez.

EZRA	Didn’t you! (grunts)

KATO	How am I supposed to have conversation with you if you will-- 

EZRA	(grunts)

KATO	(grunts) Give me a minute to spit some words out.


EZRA	I’ll give you four.

KATO	All right. Caleb, he just-- 

EZRA	(grunts)

KATO	(grunts) You said you’d let me talk.

EZRA	I can’t help it. You’ve just got such a punchable face.

KATO	Well we can’t all be vapid little pretty boys, now can we? (laughs)

EZRA	You think you’re better than me?

KATO	(overlapping) (laughs)

EZRA	(grunts)

ERIN	Ezra?

AMBER	(whimpering)

ERIN	(overlapping) Ezra.

AMBER	(crying) No.

ERIN	(overlapping) Amber? Amber, you okay?

AMBER	He made me do it. He made me kill my best friend.

KATO	Look at you, acting all high-and-fuckin’-mighty.

EZRA	(breathes heavily)

KATO	(overlapping) Don’t act like you grew a conscience, Ezra.

EZRA	(grunts)

KATO	(grunts) Whether I killed Caleb or not, is irrelevant. You want my time. You’re gonna kill me no 
matter what. You’re not the hero of the story, Ezra. (spits)

EZRA	(grunts)

AMBER	What choice did I have?

ERIN	Peterson made us all do things we didn’t wanna do. Look, let’s go back to camp. We can figure it 
out, okay?

AMBER	(groans)

ERIN	Rian is figuring out a way to disarm the vests.

AMBER	(screams)

ERIN	(overlapping) (screams) Get off me!

AMBER	(overlapping) Fuck you! Fuck you.

ERIN	(grunts)

ERIN	(screams)

RIAN	Sounds like Erin.

ERIN	(grunts)

AMBER	(grunts) I have to kill you.

PJ	I gotta go save her.

RIAN	What the fuck, PJ. No.

PJ	You- you don’t need me for this. You got this. Okay, what’s the point in surviving tonight if none of 
our friends, do? Okay, she could be dead by the time that we deactivate these things. No, I gotta do 
this.

ERIN	(overlapping) (screams)

RIAN	No, babe.

PJ	Ta- take this and stab Kato in the fucking face if he comes near you, okay? Be careful. You can end 
this. You got this! You fucking got this!

RIAN	(overlapping) (groans)

EZRA	(grunts)

KATO	(overlapping) (grunts) (spits) (grunts) You know what, man? (grunts) Just kill me. Just get it over 
with.

EZRA	No! Fight back! It’s fucking weird killing you when you’re surrendering.

PJ	(grunts) Erin?

ERIN	(grunts)

AMBER	(overlapping) (grunts) Oh, god. Fuck.

ERIN	(overlapping) (breathing heavily)

AMBER	Fuckin’ mute. (screams) Yeah.

KATO	Before you kill me, I just want you to know, I didn’t kill Caleb. I didn’t poison his drinks. I promise. I 
swear. (grunts)

EZRA	(grunts)

KATO	(overlapping) You bitch. From the moment you got back, all the punching notwithstanding, I knew 
something had changed. You got weak. Usually it takes months, if not years, for a girl to break a 
guy down into a spineless, emasculated puddle of a man. Ah, but five minutes with Erin and you got 
soft.

EZRA	(groans)

KATO	(overlapping) But I’m not soft. I am as hard as a priest in a playground.

RIAN	(grunting)

EZRA	(gurgling)

PJ	(grunting) Erin!

EZRA	(gurgling)

EZRA	(gurgling)

KATO	Come on, Ezra. You gonna fuckin’ die or blow up? Oh, finally. Still the lowest. Fuck! Even in death 
you’re a selfish dickhead.

AMBER	(grunts)

PJ	(overlapping) Stay back, Amber. Don’t fuckin’ move! Drop the fucking knife!

AMBER	Seriously? Is this a joke.?

PJ	Put the knife down!

AMBER	What, you’re a fuckin’ hero now?

KATO	(grunting) (spits)

PJ	Go back to Rian at the camp. Now, run!

AMBER	Yeah, run, you bitch! What, are you gonna shoot me, loser? Come on, just fuckin’ do it.

PJ	Don’t fuckin’ make me.

AMBER	Fuckin’ do it!

PJ	Don’t fuckin’ make me.

RIAN	(grunting...)

ERIN	Fuck. (grunting)

AMBER	Come on you loser, what’re you waiting for? You don’t know how to shoot a fucking gun? Idiot.

PJ	Kato. Guys, look, we think we found a way that we can all win this thing, okay? We can all win, 
Kato. (breathing heavily) Come on, man. Rian’s back at the camp now. She- we think we found a 
remote that can deactivate all of us. All right? I need you guys to come with me. Come with me 
back to camp. Please. I don’t wanna shoot you, bro. I really, really don’t wanna shoot you, man. 
Just please, you gotta trust me. You’re my friend. R- Rian, she can save us!

KATO	How sure is she?

PJ	I don’t know, bro. It’s fuckin’ Rian, she knows this shit.

KATO	What’re the odds?

PJ	Ninety-nine- ninety-nine percent.

KATO	Ninety-nine?

PJ	Come on, Kato.

KATO	Not good enough. (grunts)

PJ	Kato! Kato, get off-- Sonofabitch, Kato!

KATO	(overlapping) (grunting) Fuck you!

PJ	(overlapping) No! Stop right now! Stop! (breathes heavily)

KATO	(whimpering)

PJ	You’re like a brother to me, man. Why are you doing this?

KATO	Oh, what am I doing? What am I doing?

PJ	Kato.

KATO	(grunts) Oh, you’re right, PJ. Oh, you’re right. I’m so sorry.

PJ	It’s okay. It’s okay, man.

KATO	Let’s go back to camp.

PJ	Yeah. I’d like that. Kato!

KATO	(grunts)

AMBER	Fuck yes, babe! We’re gonna win this!

KATO	That’s more like it.

RIAN	(gasps) Oh, no-no-no-no-no. Oh. Oh. (gasps)

AMBER	Erin’s meeting Rian at the camp.

KATO	(grunts)

AMBER	They won’t be able to stop us, babe.

AMBER	What’re you doing?

KATO	You know...

AMBER	Kato?

KATO	I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that whole you fucking Ezra thing. Now seems as good a 
time as any.

AMBER	What- what the fuck are you doing?

KATO	Whatever I have to.

AMBER	I tried to help you, you fuckin’ freak!

KATO	(screams)

RIAN	(grunting)

KATO	(grnting)

ERIN	(whimpering)

KATO	(grunting)

RIAN	Help! Somebody help!

KATO	(grunting)

KATO	Thanks for the good time. Slut. (whistles)

RIAN	(grunting) (breathing heavily) (gasps) Oh. Oh. Oh, come on, come on, come on. Oh. Please work. 
Please work.

KATO	Hey. No fair!

RIAN	Nope. Nope. Fuck. No.

ERIN	Oh, shit.

RIAN	(breathing heavily) Oh, you sonofabitch.

ERIN	(whimpering) Oh, thank god. Rian.

RIAN	Erin, are you okay?

ERIN	What’s going on? We’re both red.

RIAN	The fuck? PJ didn’t find you? Where’s PJ?

ERIN	He’s with Amber. He’s got a gun. He- he told me to come back for you. Did you find the remote?

RIAN	Yeah, but- but it didn’t work. I, I think everyone’s timer has been reset to the lowest score on the 
board, mine. I-- It was a trick. Peterson thought of everything.

ERIN	No-no, you can try again.

RIAN	No! We can all die right now. I’m sorry! We have to go back for PJ.

RIAN	Oh, shit.

ERIN	(gasps)

RIAN	Where’s PJ?

KATO	I hope you weren’t expecting anymore mixtapes. ‘Cause PJ got a bad case of a bullet through the 
skull.

RIAN	(groans)

KATO	(overlapping) Surprisingly, more brains came out than you’d think. And I hope you weren’t 
expecting to fuck Ezra, ‘cause he’s dead, too. (grunts) Does anybody have an aspirin?

ERIN	You fucking asshole.

KATO	Sorry, what’s that, Erin?

ERIN	You fucking asshole!

KATO	(laughs) There it is. You know, I always wanted to make you scream. (grunts)

ERIN	You’re enjoying this a little too much, Kato.

KATO	Peterson made the rules. He didn’t say we had to feel bad about it.

RIAN	(grunts) He was going to propose, you fucking psycho!

KATO	Who, PJ?

RIAN	(grunts)

KATO	(grunts) At a football game? (grunts) How did you think both of you were gonna get out of here 
alive? He would’ve made some fucking stupid kids.

RIAN	You wanna see the ring, huh?

KATO	No, not really. (laughs)

RIAN	(grunts) Look at it, you piece of shit. Look at it.

KATO	That’s all right for a man of his income. What’s three months’ salary for a guy who makes zero 
dollars?

RIAN	(grunts)

KATO	(overlapping) (grunts)

RIAN	Fuck you, Kato!

KATO	(groans)

RIAN	Come on, Erin. We’re running out of time. Hurry up, Erin.

ERIN	(overlapping) (grunting) Rian, wait. Please. Please.

KATO	(grunts)

RIAN	(grunting)

ERIN	(overlapping) (grunting) Help me.

RIAN	Here.

ERIN	(grunts)

KATO	Come on. I haven’t got all day. (grunts)

ERIN	Here, Rian, give it back. What’re you doing?

RIAN	Even if Kato’s completely out of the picture, there’s not enough time to change the rules now. 

ERIN	What are you doing?

KATO	(grunting) Where the fuck are you two? (grunting)

RIAN	Only one of us can survive.

ERIN	Wait. What the fuck are you doing?

RIAN	I was wondering how you got all that extra time on your vest, Erin.

ERIN	Rian, please, I can explain. Don’t do this.

RIAN	‘Cause you have this, his gun, and you told me he just died?

KATO	(grunts)

RIAN	Did you kill my dad, Erin?

ERIN	Rian, I swear it wasn’t me. I was there when he died. He was bleeding out. Ezra was trying-- 

RIAN	(overlapping) Put him out of his misery? Huh?

ERIN	He knew your dad wasn’t gonna  make it. By giving me the extra time, it was one friend that didn’t 
have to kill someone else.

KATO	(grunting) I’m going to find you. (grunts)

ERIN	I’m sorry. This whole thing’s my fault.

RIAN	How?

ERIN	I introduced you all to Caleb. I brought him into the circle.

RIAN	It was me, Erin.

ERIN	What? Wait. What the fuck’s going on?

KATO	(grunting)

RIAN	I killed Caleb.

ERIN	What?

RIAN	He was trending towards a G.P.A. higher than mine and...

ERIN	No! (cries) Oh, please.

RIAN	And, I wanted to be valedictorian at all costs.

ERIN	(cries)

RIAN	I, I needed the scholarship. M.I.T. on a cop’s salary not going to work. Everyone was taking speed 
at Ezra’s party and I got my hands on Kato’s stash and- I never meant to kill him. I just wanted 
enough in his system to show up on a drug test, get him disqualified from being valedictorian. But I 
fucked up some metric to imperial conversion, wound up giving him way too much.

ERIN	(overlapping) (cries) Rian.

RIAN	(overlapping) I made a really stupid mistake and Caleb died.

ERIN	No. (cries) What are you doing?

KATO	(overlapping) (grunts)

RIAN	I, I let people cover it up. I, I let my dad cover it up. It wasn’t hard to sell him on the idea that 
Caleb’s death was an accident. And I will never forgive myself.

ERIN	(overlapping) (crying)

RIAN	I’ve had to live with that, no one else knowing.

RIAN	But I don’t have to live with it anymore. You deserve to walk out of here more than anyone. You 
definitely deserve it more than me. Take this and do what you need to do, Erin.

ERIN	Don’t say that.

RIAN	Take it.

ERIN	(cries)

KATO	Found you!

RIAN/ERIN	(gasp)

KATO	(screams) Fuck, yes! 

RIAN	(grunting...)

KATO	(grunts) I’m getting fucking good at this. Turning into John Wick.

RIAN	(gurgling)

KATO	(laughs) Oh, yes! Oh, yes! No! That’s my kill! You- you stay away from her! You time-stealing bitch! 
Fuck you! Fuck you. Well, you may have more time than me, but you know you’ve only got seconds 
left to live, right? You don’t have the balls to play this game the way it’s meant to be played. Do you, 
Erin? You charity case. Fucking poor person! (grunts) Don’t point that gun at me like you’re gonna 
use it. We both know you can’t pull that trigger. You basic bitch! Do it! Do it. Pull the trigger, skank. 
If it wasn’t me tonight, it would’ve been some other guy, some other time, guaranteed. Why are we 
even talking? You won’t kill me. You’re a left swipe on Tinder. You’re a forgettable mute coward 
who can’t kill shit.

ERIN	I don’t have to kill you. I just gotta outlast you.

KATO	(screams)

ERIN	(grunts)

KATO	Get back here. Erin, you come back here now! This is still killing someone in cold blood. You’re a 
fucking murderer.

ERIN	(overlapping) (whimpering)

KATO	(overlapping) Fucking femme fatale! I killed people. I put an ax through my girlfriend’s skull. (cries) I 
earned the win tonight, not you.
ERIN	(crying)

KATO	(overlapping) (grunting) Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck this. I’m going out on my own terms. (grunts)

ERIN	(screams) (breathing heavily) (crying)

ERIN	Oh, no! No! (cries)

ERIN	(crying) Help! Somebody help me!

ERIN	(crying) Help me, please. Help me, sir, please. Please, help me. All my friends have been killed.

DRIVER	Fuck that!

ERIN	Grow a pair, you fucking coward! You fucking fu-- Fuck you!
