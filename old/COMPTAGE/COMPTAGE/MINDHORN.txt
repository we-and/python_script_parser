RICHARD	Clive, okay. I have read the script. Something like this?
 
RICHARD	I've got you.
 
PAT	You've got me alright.
 
PAT	Save it for the take, baby.
 
RICHARD	Plenty more where that came from.
 
CLIVE	That was okay, but don't open your mouth when you kiss

CLIVE	because it spreads germs all around the set.
 
CLIVE	When you're acting, purse your lips like this.

RICHARD	Clive, Clive. We weren't acting.
 
PAT	I was acting.

RICHARD	What?  

RICHARD	Hello.
 
RICHARD	Pow!

ALL	This little firecracker is the real star of Mindhorn.

PAT	Maybe I could get some more lines next time.

PETER	I can't envisage any kind of spin-off.

MONCRIEF	We work hard on Mindhorn, but we play hard too,

MONCRIEF	sometimes too hard.

MONCRIEF	Hello, rehab.
 
SPECTRUM NARRATOR	But to stay at the top,
 
SPECTRUM NARRATOR	you need to be remarkable both onscreen and off,
 
SPECTRUM NARRATOR	and Richard certainly knows how to play that game.
 
RICHARD	The Isle of Man is a ****hole. (****HOLE: SHITHOLE)
 
RICHARD	What?
 
RICHARD	Peter Easterman is not a great actor.
 
RICHARD	But when he is acting, at least he stands there and does stuff.
 
SPECTRUM NARRATOR	Whether Richard's winning awards for his acting

RICHARD	Way off, Pat.

PAT	Right. I thought maybe you'd given up acting.
 
RICHARD	You didn't catch me on the last season of Midsomer Murders? 
 
PAT	That's what made me think you'd given up.

PAT	Gotta run.

RICHARD	I think you'd be very foolish to walk away
 
RICHARD	from what I'm about to plonk down on the table.
 
PAT	I'm a serious journalist now, Richard.
 
RICHARD	Well, maybe catching the psychotic killer Paul Melly
 
RICHARD	isn't a serious enough story for you.
 
PAT	There's a press gag on that case. How do you know about it?
 
RICHARD	Why don't we grab a bite and I'll give you the full exposé. 

PAT	You mean exclusive.
 
RICHARD	Whatever you say.
 
PAT	Let's talk later.
 
RICHARD	Let's do that.
 
RICHARD	Still got it.
 
RICHARD	Shit.

RICHARD	Shit.

BAINES	Where is he?

GREEN	He said he was meditating.
 
RICHARD	Went pretty deep. Threw in a bit of capoeira.
 
BAINES	Right.
 
RICHARD	Let's nail this mother.
 
RICHARD	Sorry.

BAINES	The suspect's name is Paul Melly, and we think he

BAINES	might be using the island's extensive mine system to evade capture.

RICHARD	Mine system? 

BAINES	Mm.

RICHARD	Clever bugger.

GREEN	Do you recognise him, Richard?

RICHARD	Oh, my God. (SIGHS)

RICHARD	It's my agent. (LAUGHS) Only joking. (LAUGHS)

RICHARD	Could I get an Americano with hot milk?

BAINES	So, tragically, the boy's parents

BAINES	were killed in a car crash when he was nine, and, er, when he was informed, he was watching an episode of Mindhorn,  

BAINES	so he has developed a sort of morbid obsession with the show.

RICHARD	Could have been worse. Could have been Windjammer. (LAUGHS)

BAINES	Yeah. Well, he... he is calling in fifteen minutes, Richard, and he's calling himself the Kestrel. Now, he might make some sort of kestrel noises, er...    

RICHARD	Kestrel... kestrel noises, good. Look, I've got a couple of friends coming.

RICHARD	I wonder if I could put a list on reception.

CHIEF	A list at reception?

RICHARD	Yeah, Jeffrey Moncrief plus one.

GREEN	Er, Richard, this is Chief Inspector Derek Newsome.

RICHARD	Ah, the head honcho. 

RICHARD	El honcherino. The big cheese.

RICHARD	You look familiar. Did we golf? 

CHIEF	No.

RICHARD	I actually wanted to talk to you about the press conference. I'm willing to front that.

RICHARD	We could co-host, but I'm camera trained, and sometimes in these things police can come across as a bit weird and sweaty-looking.    

CHIEF	Mister Thorncroft, 

CHIEF	you are aware of the seriousness of the situation?

RICHARD	Big time, yes, indeed. We'll hash out the details of that later. (TO ALL) Is there a dressing room?  

CHIEF	This is a

CHIEF	phone call. You know how phones work, right?

RICHARD	I don't know 

RICHARD	if you know how acting works.

CHIEF	Not really, and I'm not interested.

RICHARD	We all have our process. Er,

RICHARD	sometimes an item of clothing or footwear can define a character.

RICHARD	Er, you have your costume, I have mine.

CHIEF	This isn't a costume.

CHIEF	This is an officially sanctioned uniform denoting rank and civic responsibility.  

RICHARD	It's still a kind of costume, though, isn't it? You put it on to play 'the chief'  

RICHARD	and then later on you take it off when you go 

RICHARD	home to your wife, or maybe you don't. (LAUGHS)

RICHARD	All the world's a stage.

CHIEF	No, it isn't.

CHIEF	A young woman has been murdered and we're trying to catch her killer

CHIEF	before he does it again.

RICHARD	Okay.

BAINES	Do you wanna get

BAINES	changed through here?

RICHARD	Mm. What's wrong with him? 

RICHARD	Lost his truncheon?

RICHARD	Jeff. 

MONCRIEF	Richie.

RICHARD	The cops are being a little bloody stingy with the door policy. 

MONCRIEF	Ah, bastards.

RICHARD	Yeah, so we're gonna have to get the 

RICHARD	photographer to take the photos outside the building looking in. I'm on the first floor. I'll favour the windows on the north side. 

MONCRIEF	North windows. Right, got it.

RICHARD	Are you nearly here?

MONCRIEF	Er, I'm running a tad late, Richie. I had to tidy up the Glendale account. (TO AUDIENCE) Er, will you speed things up there, Barbara? 


MONCRIEF	You know, it's great to be heading back to the big time with you, Richie.

RICHARD	Wish me luck.

MONCRIEF	Hey, you are going to be great, Richie. Tits and teeth, eh.

RICHARD	Hello, old friend.

BAINES	Richard.

RICHARD	Bainesy.

BAINES	When Melly calls, you need to stay in character at all times.

RICHARD	Don't worry about that. When I go in, I go deep.

RICHARD	Ah, the old two-way mirrors. I love these things.

BAINES	Okay, 

BAINES	here's a list of prompts. If you could just stick to script, that would be great.

BAINES	And avoid any of these, you know, trigger words.

RICHARD 	Insane. Nutjob. Mental. Blah, blah, blah, usual stuff.

RICHARD	This the phone?

BAINES	That is the phone.

RICHARD	Great.

BAINES	Yeah.

RICHARD	Yeah. That's gonna be okay.

BAINES	If you... actually, if you could just keep it in 

BAINES	its cradle, Richard,

RICHARD	Sure.

BAINES	until, you know...

RICHARD	Just connecting with the props.

BAINES	So, when he calls, keep him on the line, keep him talking,

RICHARD	Hmm-mm.

BAINES	arrange to meet, and we'll take it from there.

GREEN	Here you go, Richard. 

GREEN	I couldn't find any manuka honey.

RICHARD	Oh.

RICHARD	Two teabags, though?

GREEN	Yep, just like you said.

RICHARD	Good. A little 

RICHARD	tip I picked up from Sean Bean. Double-bag Bean, we called him. The Bean Bag.

BAINES	This is it.

RICHARD	Shoes going on.

RICHARD	Shoes on. 

BAINES	Yeah, whenever you're ready, Richard. 

BAINES	Yeah, whenever you're ready, Richard.

CHIEF	Oh, Jesus. Answer it.

CHIEF	Fucking clown.

RICHARD	Mindhorn makes people wait.

RICHARD	And when they wait, they become angry, and when they're angry, they become vulnerable, and when they're vulnerable, they make mistakes. 

RICHARD	Yo, what's going down?

RICHARD	Hello? 

RICHARD	Hello?

RICHARD	He's hung up. 

RICHARD	You

RICHARD	might wanna try one four seven one.

RICHARD	Yo, what's going down, Kestrel?

MELLY	Do you remember me? 

RICHARD	Course I do. What do you want, sir?

MELLY	I have something for you, Mindhorn.

RICHARD	That's nice. 

RICHARD	Is it my birthday?

BAINES	Yes, yes, he's close, 

BAINES	maybe in a phone box just round the corner.

RICHARD	The only present I'm interested in is the 

RICHARD	truth. And don't bother wrapping it, because 

RICHARD	I don't care for pretty packaging.

MELLY	How do I know this is really 

MELLY	you?

RICHARD	How do I know it's really you, Kestrel,

RICHARD	not just some insane, mental nutjob?

MELLY	Why would you say that?

MELLY	I'm the Kestrel.

MELLY	More people are going to die.

RICHARD	We're all gonna die, Kestrel. Get over it. Some with a bang, some with a whimper. Some with a weird wasting disease. 

MELLY	It really is you.

RICHARD	Gold star, Kestrel. Now tell me something I don't already bloody 

RICHARD	know.

MELLY	You want to catch Katya's 

MELLY	killer, don't you? Well, 

MELLY	get this.

MELLY	What's that 

MELLY	noise? Is there anyone else there?

RICHARD	Negative, sir. Mindhorn works alone. Listen, big guy, why don't we grab some face-to-face time and 

RICHARD	sort this baby out? Where you calling from?

MELLY	No, it's not safe.

MELLY	The piggies are listening. 

MELLY	You know the quarry?

RICHARD	Course I know.

MELLY	Good.
MELLY	I'll meet you outside the quarry.

RICHARD	See you there.

MELLY	Come alone.

RICHARD	I always do.

BAINES	Which quarry?

RICHARD	No idea. Did you get a 

RICHARD	trace?

BAINES	No. 

RICHARD	What kind of an outfit

RICHARD	is this? That is a rookie mistake.

RICHARD	Hey.

CHIEF	You were meant to keep him on the line.

RICHARD	That's not the way the scene played out there, big dog.

GREEN	There's the quarry at Vazon Edge.

RICHARD	Hello. That's where 

RICHARD	we used to do all our car chases in the show. That's where he'll be. Go get him, team. 

CHIEF	Prick.

RICHARD	Oh, dear. 

RICHARD	Someone's not a happy bunny. 

RICHARD	I remember him now. I think it was his wife I used to play golf with. If you catch my drift.   

RICHARD	Hole in one.

RICHARD	Didn't think he knew.

GREEN	Er... why do you think Melly said outside the quarry?

RICHARD	Hm?

GREEN	Well it's just a strange thing to say.

GREEN	Do you think the quarry meant something different on Mindhorn?

RICHARD	A quarry's a 

RICHARD	quarry, Green. I wouldn't overthink these things. Just gonna go and drain the python.

RICHARD	And then we can have a natter about the press conference.

CHIEF	ETA to Vazon Edge quarry four minutes.

GREEN	All cars, all cars, the quarry is the police station. Melly is here. Over.

CHIEF	Roger that. Diverting.

CHIEF	Turn around. Do it 

CHIEF	now!

BAINES	What are you doing?

CHIEF	Move the fucking van, you prick!

BAINES	It's alright. Calm down.

GREEN	Richard.
GREEN	Thorncroft's gone. I repeat, I've lost eyes on Thorncroft. Thorncroft has gone. (TO AUDIENCE) Shit.  

RICHARD	Okay, you got the action shots through the window. Why don't we hit the park and get something a bit more dramatic?  

MELLY	Good plan.

GREEN	Thorncroft may be in danger. The suspect was outside the station.

RICHARD	That might be a great backdrop. I'll be here. Obviously I'll pull this in on the day. 

RICHARD	Er, good to go. 

MELLY	Your face

MELLY	has fallen down.

MELLY	It's all baggy. 

RICHARD	Er, yeah, 

RICHARD	do you mind? Er, We all age. 

RICHARD	Use some backlight, soften the focus. I'm not gonna tell you your job. 

RICHARD	Jesus. Jeff? 

MONCRIEF	Richie, where 

MONCRIEF	are you?

RICHARD	I'm with the photographer, and, to be honest, he's a bit weird. Where are you?  

MONCRIEF	I'm with the photographer. Outside the station.

MONCRIEF	Hey, you must have made quite an impression. There's police running about like headless chickens.  

MONCRIEF	Are you celebrating already. Richie?

MELLY	Clever Mindhorn.

MELLY	It's time.

MELLY	Time for the apocalypse of justice.

RICHARD	Ooh.

MELLY	Mindhorn. 

RICHARD	Please, no.

MELLY	Look...

MELLY	Look into my eyes.

MELLY	Can you see the truth?

RICHARD	Yeah.

MELLY	Did you receive 

MELLY	the evidence I sent to your house?

RICHARD	Yes, definitely.

MELLY	You did?

MELLY	Then you know I'm innocent! 

MELLY	Are you on the case?

RICHARD	Yes.

MELLY	Yeah?

RICHARD	Yes, sir. 

MELLY	Yeah? Yeah!

MELLY	It's

MELLY	pretend, see? 

CHIEF	Melly, 

CHIEF	step away from the actor!

BAINES	Stay

BAINES	down, Richard!

MELLY	See you at the wheel, Mindhorn.

RICHARD	Shoot him! 

RICHARD	Shoot him in the head!

MELLY	(REACTS)

PAT	My next guest 

PAT	is a celebrated actor and now an award-winning writer.

PAT	Richard Thorncroft, welcome to the show.

RICHARD	Hello.

PAT	So you finished your book, which is not only deeply entertaining.

PAT	It is also the first actor's autobiography to be nominated for a Booker Prize.  

PAT	You've embarked on a new production of Hamlet with Kenneth Branagh.

RICHARD	Mm hm.

PAT	All after becoming a hero by making this island safe for vulnerable women like myself.  

RICHARD	You're welcome.

PAT	Thank you.

PAT	Apparently after the shock of the accident, all your hair grew back.

RICHARD	Yes, it's 

RICHARD	a medical phenomenon known as follicle neogenesis.

KENNETH BRANAGH	And conversely, er, when I heard about the accident, 

KENNETH BRANAGH	er, all my hair fell out.

PAT	Thanks, Ken, but we're talking about Richard at the moment.

KENNETH BRANAGH	Oh, I'm so sorry. Sorry. (TO RICHARD) Sorry, Rich.

RICHARD	No probs, Ken.

KENNETH BRANAGH	Okay.

PAT	May I? 

RICHARD	Fill your boots.

RICHARD	Mm. That's 

RICHARD	it. Don't be afraid.

KENNETH BRANAGH	With that audition, he changed the  

KENNETH BRANAGH	way that people think about

KENNETH BRANAGH	making art.

KENNETH BRANAGH	Politically 

KENNETH BRANAGH	I think he's become very important.

PAM	Richard.

KENNETH BRANAGH	For me, there is no one else. 

KENNETH BRANAGH	Like   

KENNETH BRANAGH	Mandela,

PAT	Richard.

KENNETH BRANAGH	Ben Kingsley 

KENNETH BRANAGH	and then there is Richard.

PAT	Richard,...

MAYOR	...I'm going to give you the best Manx Day you've ever had.

MAYOR	Of course, the parade 

MAYOR	is at the heart of Manx Day, always has been, 

MAYOR	always will be, but this...

MONCRIEF	Richie, baby. Bloody....

RICHARD	Jeffrey Moncrief. (REACTS, LAUGHS)

MONCRIEF	Good to see 

MONCRIEF	you. Look at you. The years have treated 

MONCRIEF	you well.

RICHARD	You too. 

MONCRIEF	Ah. Don't lie. I'm 

MONCRIEF	a fucking wreck. But who cares, eh?

RICHARD	That's right. That's...

MONCRIEF	You did it. They got him. You're a hero.

RICHARD	Mm. Well... I don't think you can smoke in hospitals, Jeff.

MONCRIEF	Since when? 

RICHARD	Since the fifties? (LAUGHS)

MONCRIEF	Oh, right. How 

MONCRIEF	did it go with Pat?

RICHARD	Oh, very well, actually, yeah. 

RICHARD	I think we might just be in there.

MONCRIEF	I bet you 

MONCRIEF	are, eh.

RICHARD	Strictly business.

MONCRIEF	Oh.

MONCRIEF	Good, cos when your heroics hit the front page,

MONCRIEF	you'll have minge coming out your arse.

RICHARD	Ah. Lovely.
MONCRIEF	You remember these guys?

MONCRIEF	Nutmeg, the druid detective.

MONCRIEF	Moonshaft. He's blind, he's black and he's back.

RICHARD	They're out on DVD?

MONCRIEF	Ten grand apiece they got. And they were shite.

MONCRIEF	Mindhorn had a metal eye that could see the truth.

MONCRIEF	What did Nutmeg have? Some fucking joss sticks?

RICHARD	This is interesting, Jeff.

MONCRIEF	Aye, and Pete thinks so too.

MONCRIEF	He even wants to release it through his production company.

RICHARD	Pete Easterman? 

MONCRIEFF	The Windjammer himself.

RICHARD	Ah,

RICHARD	mm... this is a bad idea, Jeff.

MONCRIEF	Why?

RICHARD	Er, Pete and I have a history. Things have been said.

MONCRIEF	No, no, that's all water under the bridge.

MONCRIEF	Pete insisted you come to his country club this evening. He wants to make it happen.  

MONCRIEF	Mindhorn series one to three on DVD. How d'you like those apples?  

RICHARD	This is actually 

RICHARD	a bloody good idea.

MONCRIEF	(LAUGHS) I told you, eh. 

MONCRIEF	Lovely. Seven o'clock, Jammers Club.

MONCRIEF	Lock up your pussy! The Wolf Pack is back on the prowl.

MONCRIEF	Okay.

RICHARD	It's a hospital, 

RICHARD	Jeff. Keep it down a little bit.

MONCRIEF	Aye.

MONCRIEF	Flange ahoy, Richie. Flange ahoy.

RICHARD	Yes indeed.

PAT	More on that unfolding tragedy later.

PAT	Why does the Manx cat have no tail?

PAT	Some say they swam 

PAT	ashore during a shipwreck in the sixteenth century.

PAT 	Others say it's a genetic mutation.

PAT	Chekhov?

PAT	Chekhov?

PAT	Hello?

RICHARD	Hello, you.

PAT	Hello, Richard.

RICHARD	Hello. 

RICHARD	So, you're still at the Heights.

PAT	Yes, that's a good guess.

PAT	So, I hear they caught Melly.

RICHARD	Yeah.

RICHARD	I put him out of action. That lunatic won't be troubling the women of this island no more.  

PAT	Quite a story.

RICHARD	I like to think so.

PAT	Richard Thorncroft does something for somebody else.

RICHARD	Pow! I walked into that.

PAT	Where are you at the moment?

RICHARD	Oh, I'm staying at the Grand. Well, that's where they've put me up, anyway, you know, er...

RICHARD	For my sins. It's nice, you know, a little, er, suite. One of those little... suites...  

RICHARD	Ooh. Sorry. Just, er, slipped on a, er, breakfast tray.

RICHARD	Ha. Bloody room service. Huh.

RICHARD	Yeah, I mean, who'd have thought, hey, you and I would have ended up drifting like two lonely boats on the sea of life? (LAUGHS) 

RICHARD	Just two boats who crossed once before and are now crossing again on the return charter, looking for that safe harbour, that magical other person, and sometimes, let me tell you, that other person can be staring you right in the face and you never even realised it.

CLIVE	Hey, Richie.

RICHARD	Clive. 

CLIVE	Wow. 

RICHARD	Clive.

CLIVE	Wow. It's so good to see you.

RICHARD	It's so good to see you.

RICHARD	What's, ah...

CLIVE	What are you doing in my garden, man?

RICHARD	What are you doing in the garden?

CLIVE	Well, I live here. 

RICHARD	Yeah. 

CLIVE	Yeah.

RICHARD	What? What, in the garden?

CLIVE	No, silly. I live here with Pat. We've

CLIVE	been together for many, many years now, since you left.

CLIVE	You know that, right?

RICHARD	Yeah. Yeah, that's...

CLIVE	You're joking... You're joking with me.

RICHARD	Yes, I do. That's old news. Joke. (LAUGHS)

CLIVE	Oh, wow.

CLIVE	So what are you doing in the garden?

RICHARD	Yeah.

RICHARD	Yeah. Just, er... coming to get some fan mail. I popped round to get fan mail.

CLIVE	Ah. Yeah.

CLIVE	Well, we get that from time to time.

RICHARD	Yeah, so I thought I'd swing by...

CLIVE	So what's with the flowers?

RICHARD	Um, er, I've got a funeral later to do, so.

CLIVE	Ah, that's sad.

RICHARD	Er, yeah.

CLIVE	I guess you're at that age now.

RICHARD	Yeah, sad.

CLIVE	Anyone I 

CLIVE	know?

RICHARD	Erm, John Nettles.

CLIVE	John Nettles? Shit.

RICHARD	Yeah, not... not... not the...

CLIVE	I know John really well. 

RICHARD	No, no. Not that John Nettles.

CLIVE	Oh. Okay. Alright.

RICHARD	Another one. He's a new person.

CLIVE	That's a relief.

RICHARD	Yeah. (LAUGHS)

CLIVE	Come in. Oh, my God, come in. Pat's gonna love to see you.

RICHARD	Yeah. 

CLIVE	Everyone wants to see you.

RICHARD	I'm, really... It's very nice of you.

CLIVE	Come on in.

RICHARD	Everyone?

CLIVE	Yeah.

JASMINE	Clive,

JASMINE	can I have the keys to the Range Rover, please?

CLIVE	Hey, Jasmine, look who it is.

RICHARD	Hi.

CLIVE	It's Mindhorn. (LAUGHS) 

RICHARD	Hello.

CLIVE	I used to be this guy's stunt man. Can you believe it?

CLIVE	Look at him now. Look at this. (TO RICHARD) What is this you have here?

RICHARD	Ah, well, that's, er, called living the high life. (LAUGHS)

CLIVE	Yeah? Too many biscuits?

RICHARD	Ah, champagne, you know. Other stuff...

CLIVE	Too many garibaldis.

RICHARD	Steak and rich cheese.

CLIVE	Yeah.

JASMINE	At least he covers himself up. Can you 

JASMINE	put some trousers on?

CLIVE	She's joking. She's very funny. She has her mother's tongue, you know? 

JASMINE	Richard Thorncroft? 

CLIVE	Yeah, look at him. There he is.

RICHARD	Hm. Hm.

JASMINE	Yeah, I've heard a lot about you. 

RICHARD	Oh. All of it good, I hope?

CLIVE	Oh, watch out.

CLIVE	This guy, okay, this guy used to make me tell everybody he did his own stunts.

RICHARD	Well, I did a few of my own stunts.

CLIVE	No, no, you naughty liar.

RICHARD	That's not... that's not lying.

CLIVE	You never did. You never did any, you naughty, naughty boy.

RICHARD	I did... I did some. Come on, Clive.

CLIVE	No, you didn't (TO JASMINE) He couldn't even drive a car.

RICHARD	Yeah, but now I have passed, first time. You know...

JASMINE	Well, I'd love to stay here and watch you two verbally sparring,

CLIVE	Oh...

JASMINE	but I have to go.

JASMINE	Mum, are you ready?

CLIVE	Hey, Pat, 

CLIVE	look what I found in the garden. It's a Richard Thorncroft tree. I cut him down and brought him in the house. (LAUGHS)

PAT	Richard.

RICHARD	Hello.

PAT	What are you doing here? 

PAT	You said you were at the Grand.

RICHARD	Oh.

CLIVE	I can answer that. He's, er, come for some fan mail.



PAT	You're getting your fan mail? 

PAT	Oh. I'm really touched.

CLIVE	Oh, yeah, there's some in the garage. I'll go and fetch it for you.

RICHARD	Mm.

CLIVE	Oh...

CLIVE	Don't go getting back together. I'm kidding. Look at him.

CLIVE	He's so fat now. He's a mess.

RICHARD	Oh, he's great.

RICHARD	Um... Clive. (LAUGHS) 

PAT	Clive.

RICHARD	Clive. Mm.

PAT	You wanna talk about Clive?

RICHARD	I don't wanna talk about Clive.

RICHARD	No, no. I mean, obviously he's a great bloke, lovely bloke.

RICHARD	Er, great choice. Look, I think, er, I might scoot.

RICHARD	And we should do that interview, though.

PAT	Sure. 

PAT	Why don't you, erm, pop round to Manx TV tomorrow?

RICHARD	Okay.

RICHARD	See you tomorrow. 

PAT	You're going the wrong way, Richard.

RICHARD	Yeah.

CLIVE	Whoa... Hey, Richie.

CLIVE	Come on, I wanna show you something. You're gonna like it.

RICHARD	I've just - I've gotta get to this funeral.

CLIVE	No. Hey, look at this, huh?

CLIVE	Memories, huh?

RICHARD	Yes, sir.

CLIVE	You know, when I found her, 

CLIVE	she was on the scrap heap. Can you believe that? She was pretty busted up.

CLIVE	One careless owner.

CLIVE	But then I brought her here, fixed her up, gave her all the love and the care and attention she needed and now she goes like a dream.    

CLIVE	Take her out for a ride every single day.

CLIVE	And then 

CLIVE	I fixed up the car.

CLIVE	I was talking about Pat.

RICHARD	Yeah.

CLIVE	Not the car.

RICHARD	Hm-hm. Got it.

CLIVE	A double meaning type thing and I was...

RICHARD	Very good.

CLIVE	...being funny.

RICHARD	Yes.

CLIVE	But you didn't laugh.

RICHARD	No, I'll, I'll laugh later. 

CLIVE	That's okay.

RICHARD	Well, thank you for the joke.  

CLIVE	Oh, no, no, come

CLIVE	get your fan mail.

CLIVE	Yeah, it's just through here. Come on.

RICHARD	Right.

CLIVE	Yeah, step into my office.

RICHARD	Okay.

CLIVE	You know, wow, I didn't realise the show was so 

CLIVE	popular. You get so many letters.

RICHARD	Yeah, 

RICHARD	over the years it's acquired a certain cachet.

CLIVE	You want me to call a man with a van?

RICHARD	Very, very witty.

CLIVE	Yeah.

RICHARD	Yeah.

CLIVE	I did two jokes. One over there and one just now.

RICHARD	I see that 

RICHARD	you're very proud of yourself.

CLIVE	Yeah, a little bit.

RICHARD	You know what you are?

RICHARD	You are my stunt man. That's all 

RICHARD	you'll ever be.

CLIVE	Yeah, it's my job though, so... 

RICHARD	What,

RICHARD	to be my stand in?

CLIVE	Yeah, I'm a stand-in when people can't do things 

CLIVE	physically. That's when they call me. You know what I mean?

RICHARD	Well, I'm at the top of my physical game, sir.

CLIVE	Yeah, well, you're hiding it really well these days.

RICHARD	Yeah? 

RICHARD	Don't make me unleash the Ginga.

CLIVE	Ginga? You're 

CLIVE	going to play giant wooden blocks with me?

RICHARD	Ginga, not 

RICHARD	Jenga. It's a capoeira term. It could get messy, sir.

CLIVE	Enjoy reading the fan mail. Don't read it all at once.

CLIVE	You forgot your flowers.

CLIVE	Oh, sweet.

CLIVE	Hey, baby. 
CLIVE	I got you some flowers.

PAT	Thanks.

CLIVE	Yeah, 

CLIVE	you know, just to say

CLIVE	good luck with the golf and...

PAT	It's time to get some pussy'?

CLIVE	Well, it's been a while.

PAT	I'm gonna play golf. 

CLIVE	Okay, baby. I'm gonna do some gardening. 

JASMINE	Oh, it's nice. 

PAT	Don't.

MONCRIEF	Do you, er, fancy a toot?

RICHARD	I'm gonna

RICHARD	say no to that, Jeff actually, in public especially,

RICHARD	because, er, well, I, I had to give that up due to 

RICHARD	adverse chemical reactions.

MONCRIEF	Woah, let's make some fucking deals, eh? 

RICHARD	Yes, let's do that. Listen, I might take a lead when we get in 

RICHARD	there, you know, do the talking.

RICHARD	You could perhaps hang back?

MONCRIEF	Me?

MONCRIEF	No, no, I'm not going in anyway.

RICHARD	You're not going in?

MONCRIEF	No, I'm barred. 

RICHARD	Oh. Well, you didn't mention that, either.

MONCRIEF	Ah,

MONCRIEF	it's a long story.

RICHARD	Okay, Jeff. Alright, well I'll see you 

RICHARD	after.

MONCRIEF	I'll see you later.

RICHARD	You've still got some stuff...

MONCRIEF	Oh, right. (CLEARS THROAT)

RECEPTIONIST	Hello, sir.

WOMAN	Er, no, I'm not sure I'm just

WOMAN	waiting for a friend.

RICHARD	(LAUGHS) What a twat.

PETER	Richard Horncroft. //

RICHARD	The beast-man. (LAUGHS)

PETER	Be careful,

PETER	ladies. This guy is a real live wire.

PETER	Dangerous 

PETER	to know.

PETER	Twang! 

RICHARD	(REACTS, LAUGHS) Oof!

PETER	Ahh. So what you been doing? Where have you been hiding?

RICHARD	Inside a busy schedule.

PETER	Really?

RICHARD	Mmm. (LAUGHS)

PETER	How am I looking?

RICHARD	You're looking good.

PETER	Yeah, I know.

PETER	So a little dick bird tells me you've got an idea floating around in the old bonsai.

RICHARD	Hmm. I certainly do.

RICHARD	The heat I'm about to generate off the back of the police thing

RICHARD	I think could be funnelled through into a DVD release.//

RICHARD	And that's where you come in.

PETER	It's a sweet angle.

RICHARD	I think so too. 

RICHARD	So what do you think? Are, are we in business on this?

PETER	I say yeah, let's do it, let's sign.

RICHARD	Alright. (LAUGHS)

PETER	Thanks, Coco.

RICHARD	Pete, I like the way you do business.

MONCRIEF	We're heading back to the big time.

RICHARD	There you are. 

RICHARD	(CHUCKLES)

PETER	Before we, er, seal this puppy, is there anything else you wanna run by me?

RICHARD	No. I think we're good to go, yeah?

PETER	I mean, nothing, er, that you might have said, er, publicly?

PETER	You called 

PETER	me a stinking ham, on Wogan, with the emotional range of a chair leg.

RICHARD	Did I say that?

PETER	I've gotta say, you've got brass balls coming in here.

PETER	I'll give you that.

RICHARD	Okay, look, I - I just wanted to come here with an opportunity, something for you to get involved in.

PETER	What, in your pathetic career?

RICHARD	You've gone too far.

RICHARD	I've got plenty of offers all 

RICHARD	over this island. I don't need to go to you.

PETER	Oh, I'm sure you're inundated with requests

PETER	for the greatest actor of his generation. 

PETER	Behold...

RICHARD	When you're the head 

RICHARD	of a busy multinational corporation, 

RICHARD	you don't have time to exercise. But 

RICHARD	with Tumpers, the man girdle system for men,

RICHARD	you don't have to waste time 

RICHARD	on your waistline. Tumpers man girdle tightens 

RICHARD	the waist, removing unsightly side, back, 

RICHARD	and tummy bulge.

RICHARD	Yeah? Something funny?

PETER	You're finished.

PETER	You fucked off to Hollywood twenty-five years ago 'cause some LA windbag said you were gonna be the next Burt Reynolds.

PETER	Yeah. You gambled and you lost. You lost at life.

PETER	You're living in a dream world.

RICHARD	I'm living in a dream world?

RICHARD	Sorry, that's funny, because this is a dream world, Peter.

RICHARD	You're living in a plastic palace. None

RICHARD	of this is real. This is not real.

RICHARD	That's real, but this is not real.

RICHARD	It's full of sycophants and prostitutes.

PETER	You're a joke, Richard.

PETER	Pat never charged me. That one was on the house.

RICHARD	Shit.

RICHARD	Sorry. 

RICHARD	Sorry. I was not aiming for you.

PETER	Someone get Richard a skinny green.

ONLOOKER	Is she alright?

RICHARD	Shove it up your arse.

ONLOOKER	Somebody call the police.

MONCRIEF	Eh?

RICHARD	Get that cocaine.

RICHARD	And he's made one of the biggest mistakes of his professional career.

MONCRIEF	Biggest mistake. That's right. 

MONCRIEF	That's it, Richie. Get it down you. Eh!

MONCRIEF	I love you.

MONCRIEF	Do you remember this? Hey…(VOICE FX)

MONCRIEF	And 

MONCRIEF	action!

RICHARD	...Mindhorn.

RICHARD	Up yours! This

RICHARD	island is a shithole! (VOICE FX)

RICHARD	That was a classic night, Jeff. (GROANS)

CHIEF	Can I get you an Alka-Seltzer?

RICHARD	Oh, shit.

CHIEF	If you 

CHIEF	ever set foot on this island again, you're going to jail.

RICHARD	Is this about your wife?

CHIEF	What?

CHIEF	We've never forgotten what you said about the Isle of Man on Wogan.

CHIEF	You said that we had a limited 

CHIEF	gene pool.

RICHARD	Well, you do. And 

RICHARD	you have nothing on me because...

CHIEF	You're joking, aren't you?

CHIEF	I could bang you up just for the vandalism alone.

RICHARD	Yes. //

RICHARD	What vandalism?

CLIVE	On this side we have a penis here, as you can see, the scrotum. In Holland we call this the acorn. Got breasts here, phallus, this time with the sputum. I don't know what this is.
 
GREEN	That's an anus. 

CLIVE	No. I think it's a titty.

BAINES	Alright, Richard.

BAINES	You just wait here and I will get the car.

RICHARD	Okay.

CLIVE	Oh, hey, Rich. Hey, settle 

CLIVE	an argument. What - what is this here? Is it an anus?

RICHARD	I don't know what that is. It's got nothing to do with me.

CLIVE	You signed it, you moron. 

RICHARD	Well,

RICHARD	I can speak English.

CLIVE	And, he's...

CLIVE	now he's racist, so write this 

CLIVE	down. Racist.

PAT	You know, I nearly believed you for a minute.

RICHARD	Look, 

RICHARD	I came here to help the police and just… things went a bit wrong.

PAT	You came back here to get 

PAT	some publicity from the murder.

RICHARD	That's not why I came back.//

PAT	Stop lying to yourself, Richard.

RICHARD	And you're not lying to yourself? 

RICHARD	Serious journalism? Manx cats with no tails? //

RICHARD	Pat, you used to be an artist.

PAT	I was a piece of totty in a shit TV show.

RICHARD	Mindhorn was not a shit TV show.

CLIVE	Hey, Richie.

CLIVE	You keep leaving things at the house. Your jacket, Pat, your dignity. (LAUGHS)
 
RICHARD	Yeah. You think you've got it all, don't you, Clive? You think you've got it all sewn up. What you've got is a domestic prison.

CLIVE	Better than a real prison.

RICHARD	Yeah. You've got your little wife, your little daughter.

RICHARD	I've got freedom on my side. I go where the wind takes me.

CLIVE	No, Jasmine isn't 

CLIVE	mine.

RICHARD	What? 

CLIVE	Jasmine isn't mine.

CLIVE	Pat never told you?

RICHARD	Pat didn't tell me what?

RICHARD	What about Jasmine? 

BAINES	Richard!

CLIVE	Yeah, bye Richard. Nice to see you.

GREEN	He's a very confused man.

CLIVE	Yeah, tell me about it. He didn't even know about 

CLIVE	Jasmine.

GREEN	Your daughter? 

CLIVE	Oh, no,

CLIVE	she's not my daughter, I've had the, er, snip. No, she's, er, Peter Easterman's daughter.

CLIVE	You had the snip, Green?

GREEN	No.

CLIVE	Something to think about.

RICHARD	Well, we, we got our man. Hopefully that makes up for the graffiti. And, er, 

RICHARD	Well, you know, who knows, 

RICHARD	maybe under different circumstances...

BAINES	Yeah, thanks, bye.

AGENT	Richard, hi. I think you're going through another transitional phase.

AGENT	From unemployed actor to unemployable actor.

AGENT	I'm gonna have to let you go. I've left your headshots in reception. When you collect them, don't come up.
 
DAD WITH NEWSPAPER	Are you finished?

RICHARD	Hm?

DAD WITH NEWSPAPER	The newspaper?

RICHARD	Oh, yeah.

ANNOUNCER	Would foot passengers waiting for the two-fifteen departure to Liverpool now kindly make their way to the ferry terminal.

MELLY	Clue number one. The killer is a secret baldie.

MELLY	Clue number two. A videotape of the actual killing.

PAT	Breaking news at the Laxey 

PAT	Wheel. Suspected murderer Paul Melly has escaped from Greenborough Hospital 

PAT	and taken himself hostage.

PAT	The public are warned not to approach Melly, as he is both armed and

PAT	dangerous.

MELLY	Get me Mindhorn!

REPORTER	It now seems certain the actor Richard Thorncroft, who disappeared two days ago, is dead.

REPORTER	Thorncroft is the chief suspect in the murder of 'Mindhorn' 

REPORTER	PR guru Jeffrey Moncrief. It is now accepted that Thorncroft 

REPORTER	could be suffering a severe mental breakdown after a long career lull since the hit show ended.
 
RICHARD	Even a short walk can take its toll on the lower legs. That's why I use Thrombi-Sox.

RICHARD	Jeffrey Moncrief, who I will kill...

CLIVE	You can never say that it's a good thing when someone is dead,

CLIVE	but maybe with Richard this has been for the best.

PETER	I keep expecting him to walk through the door and er... 

PETER	and say, 'Hey, Pete, old buddy, how are the DVD sales going? 

PETER	Because, of course, 'Mindhorn' is finally released today on, on DVD.

PETER	Yeah. Erm... Actually, could you stop filming now? 'Cause I think I might be about to cry.

REPORTER	Thorncroft's excursion into the recording studio 

REPORTER	yielded this album from nineteen ninety


REPORTER	His signature tune, 'Can't Handcuff the Wind', reached number one in several East European countries.

MELLY	Your hair

MELLY	came off in the sea. But it's okay, 'cause I stuck it back on...

RICHARD	She's good enough. 

RICHARD	Lose the piece.

RICHARD	Turn around. 

RICHARD	Slowly. Hands in the air.

RICHARD	Now who's holding all the aces?

BAINES	Me, I think. 

PAT	Richard, you bloody idiot!

RICHARD	I didn't know she was gonna do that.

PAT	I thought you... (REACTS) //

RICHARD	No! 

RICHARD	Patricia!

RICHARD	Patricia, Patricia.

PAT	Richard.

RICHARD	I'm so sorry. 

PAT	No, I'm sorry. 

PAT	I never knew you wrote me all those letters.

RICHARD	Shh. Shh. That doesn't matter now.

PAT	Clive hid them from me.

RICHARD	What a wanker.

PAT	I'm sorry that I never believed you.

RICHARD	I'm sorry.

PAT	I love you, Richard.

BAINES	Fucking hell. Where's the tape, Richard?

RICHARD	There is no tape. It's fake.

RICHARD	Like everything else in my life! Without her, I may as

RICHARD	well be dead. (REACTS)

RICHARD	That was just 

RICHARD	a figure of speech.

RICHARD	Why? Why?

BAINES	The mayor's my uncle, 

BAINES	so I've gotta clean up his mess.

BAINES	Family's family. My family runs Man.

RICHARD	Call an ambulance. 

RICHARD	It's not too late. I can forget. 

BAINES	What, that I killed Moncrief?

RICHARD	Yeah, that.

RICHARD	I... I can pretend I don't know that. 

RICHARD	I can pretend.

BAINES	You're not that good an actor.

POLICEMAN	Baines! 

POLICEMAN	You all right?

BAINES	He shot Pat! He killed her and then he tried to kill me and I, er... (BREATHES) I had to take him down!

BAINES	I had to take him down!
CHIEF	Baines? 

BAINES	Chief. There was nothing I could do. It was er... 

BAINES	There was nothing I could do.

RICHARD	Nice working with you again.

CHIEF	What's going on, Thorncroft?

BAINES	The mayor's my uncle, 

BAINES	so I've gotta clean up his mess.

RICHARD	I can

RICHARD	forget.

BAINES	What, that I killed Moncrief?

RICHARD	Yeah. 

BAINES	You're not that good an actor.

RICHARD	Aren't I? (REACTS)

CLIVE	Oh, hey, now.

JASMINE	Mum!

CLIVE	Hey!

PAT	Jasmine!

CLIVE	Hey, hey, not cool.

BAINES	Both sets of keys, give 'em to me. 

CHIEF	Think about what you're doing, Baines.

BAINES	Keys now. Do it or I'll blow her away.

RICHARD	Get your 

RICHARD	filthy hands off my daughter!

BAINES	(LAUGHS) She's not your daughter. She's Windjammer's daughter.

PAT	Clive, do something.

CLIVE	Er, I'm not wearing the appropriate footwear.

RICHARD	Stand down, Clive. It's time I did my own stunts.

RICHARD	It's Ginga time.

RICHARD	This  

RICHARD	is the Ginga.

RICHARD	I'm moving between the air.

RICHARD	I'm 

RICHARD	here.

RICHARD	I'm the bringer of the  

RICHARD	Ginga.

RICHARD	And that's capoeira.

PAT	Jas.

RICHARD	Ah... The mayor was her uncle. Seems I was right about the limited gene pool. 

CHIEF	I am 

CHIEF	sorry that I rode you so hard back then. I hope we can put our differences behind us.

RICHARD	I will if you will, 

RICHARD	and, if it helps at all, I was pretty wasted all those years ago. I don't even remember that night with your wife.

CHIEF	What night with my wife? 

RICHARD	That's the spirit.

PAT	Oh, my God, Richard, that was 

PAT	so brave. It's a miracle that you weren't shot.

RICHARD	No more lies. I have to be honest.

RICHARD	The truth is, I knew there were blanks in that gun.

GREEN	Erm,
 	 
GREEN	no, no, this is Baines's gun. That was live ammunition.

PAT	Richard.

PAT	I've got you.

RICHARD	You've got me alright.

RICHARD	And that is the truth.
