IRIS			Hoeeeeeee!

PIETER			Boris, hey. Boris, come on.

PIETER			Let's go.

PIETER			Yeah, come on. Boris, hey.

PIETER			Well, let's go.

IRIS			Yes, come on.

PIETER			Breathe. And exhale, right.

IRIS			Pff, pff, pff, pff, pff, pff.  

INSERT			IN LABOUR, LOVING IT

IRIS			Whaaa, holy fack. 

OBSTETRICIAN	How's it going?

PIETER			Fine.

OBSTETRICIAN	Let me see how far along you are.

IRIS			There's another one. Ahhhhhhh!

ASSISTANT		Keep breathing, nice job.

IRIS			Hu…bleeeee. Ohhhh. Hi, sweetie

PIETER			Iris? Ahhhhhhh!

IRIS			Yes, sweetie?

PIETER			I want to ask you something important.

IRIS			Oh…

PIETER			Something I've been thinking about for a while now.

PIETER			Are you sure this child is mine?

IRIS			Seriously?

PIETER			It's just weird, suddenly you were pregnant. Despite birth control.

IRIS			Only 98 percent reliable.

PIETER		I've done some calculating. And nine months ago, you were in Milan with the camera teams.

IRIS			Mummmhhhh

PIETER			I'm sure it was fun with all those guys.

IRIS			Have you gone crazy?

PIETER			No, I really mean it.

IRIS		And this seemed like the right time to discuss it? Instead of any other time in the past nine months?

PETER-PAUL		Enter the Doctor

PIETER			Hé! 

PETER-PAUL		Hé, hé!

PIETER			Amice

PETER-PAUL		Amice!

PIETER			Hé, hé!

PETER-PAUL		Vandenberg. Congratualations

IRIS			Hé. 

PETER-PAUL		Congratulations

IRIS			Mummmhhhh

PETER-PAUL		May I?

IRIS			Be careful.

PETER-PAUL		Well, no question about it. A real Kraal.

PIETER			Just give him here.

PETER-PAUL		Right, let's take a look. Jesus.

IRIS			Hmm?

PETER-PAUL		Just kidding.

PETER-PAUL		My colleague really liked the way you pushed. No significant tearing.

IRIS			Well, PP, put away that chart. I'd like to keep it clean between us.

PETER-PAUL		But seriously, Vandenberg, really nice job.

IRIS			Oh, well.

PETER-PAUL		It's not such a big deal

IRIS			It's really pretty.

PETER-PAUL		Guys, he's really beautiful.

PIETER			Ciao. Jesus, it's just a bracelet. He gives it to all his patients by the way.

IRIS		Who cares? It's just really sweet. What are you giving me? A DNA-test? I can't believe you asked me that after hours of contractions and pushing. Contractions, do you have any idea how that feels?

PIETER			No, you're right.

IRIS		Well, it's terrible. They say it hurts,but not that it feels like you're dying, that you're tearing apart as if all the bones in your back are shattered all at once, that the pain causes you to black out.

PIETER			You were gone for a while there.

IRIS		I need you, I can't do this alone. I know you think you're not ready yet, but...you're the perfect man for me. And the perfect father for our child. I was so sure of it. I know you didn't want to have children yet, but I just speeded it up a bit. It was going to happen anyway.

PIETER			Excuse me?

IRIS		I didn't really take my birth control pills very regularly. Almost not at all... or really at all.

NURSE 2		Congratulations dr. Van Kralingen.

PIETER			Thank you.

DOCTOR		Want some Valium, Kraal?

PIETER			Dickie.

PIETER			I'm just going to get the car.

IRIS		Hey, little guy. HEY DR. LOVE, GOOD LUCK CHECK YOUR COAT FOR PRESENTS

IRIS			Suus? DADDY IS THE BEST

SUUS 			Hey, dr. Love, that was fast. Do you miss me already?

IRIS			Hello, Suus. This is Mrs Love.

SUUS 			Mrs Love? As far as I know, you're not married.

IRIS			We did just have a baby together.

SUUS 		Sweetie, you just had a baby. We'll still have to see whether Pieter is the father.

IRIS		You need to shut up. I'm sure you're really good at sucking but if you like solid foods, you should stay away from him.

SUUS (O.S.)		hat's going to be really difficult. I'm doing my residency with Kraal. And we just discussed a case while you were in labour. Good luck with the baby.

PIETER			There's my phone.

IRIS			Yes. Suus says hello.

PIETER			What do you mean?

IRIS			Is it that hard to understand?

PIETER		We're not doing this. You want me to forget you tricked me, but it's not working.

IRIS		You should've discussed it with your girl, with her dirty texts and presents.

PIETER		"I'm in love. I wanted to tell you at the beginning of this year but you were suddenly pregnant."

IRIS			At the start of the year?

PIETER		It seemed undesirable to make you go through pregnancy alone. But then Suus said that the child might not even be mine.

IRIS			So it was the idea of the horny nurse?

PIETER			Suus is not a nurse. She's an excellent student on the job.

IRIS			I am sure she is. She must be amazing,especially with hand jobs.

PIETER		This is so annoying, you are always so vulgar nowadays. That reality show changed you.

IRIS		Excuse me. You seem to forget I put you through college with my job. And now it's not good enough anymore.

PIETER			I'm in love and taking Suus to Malawi to set up a children's hospital.

IRIS		"So if I understand you correctly, you were just biding your time for nine months so you can start saving African children with Suus?"

PIETER		Stop yelling, it's not good for little Pieter. Babies are very sensitive to tension.

IRIS			Do you really think I'm naming him after you? Pieter!

PIETER			Seven storks?

IRIS			How does that work? Do they all bring a piece?

MARJAN		Surprise.

IRIS			Great timing. I couldn't have produced it more dramatic myself.

PIETER			Can we put a pin in this for now? Please?

MRS. VAN		Sorry! Hahahaha.

PIETER			Mom.

MRS. VAN		Congratulations my boy.

PIETER			Dad.

MR. VAN		Congratulations.

PIETER			Thanks.

MR. VAN 		Where's the little prince?

PIETER			With Iris. I'll go...

PIETER			Here we are.

MRS. VAN		He looks just like you. Sweetie.

BABETTE		Look at him. He's perfect.

CASSANDRA		This is the most beautiful baby ever.

BABETTE		So you have seen babies before?

CASSANDRA		From a safe distance, of course.

BABETTE		Hey.

CASSANDRA		I still have 20/20 vision, Babs.

BABETTE		You think eyesight deteriorates when giving birth?

CASSANDRA		It deteriorates your appearance.

MRS. VAN		Hey, little Pieter. Hello, pretty boy.

MR. VAN		Hey.

MRS. VAN 		Did you see all those pretty balloons and those fun birds? From grandpa and grandma Van Kralingen.

MR. VAN		Yes. 

MARJAN		Come on sweetie, take some time to recuperate.

IRIS			Yes.

MRS. VAN		Yes.

MR. VAN		Was he really bloody? Well…

MRS. VAN 		Stop it.

BABETTE		Wait here, I'll get you a chair.

PIETER			His Apgar score was an A+.

MR. VAN		He's got it from you.

PIETER			Very healthy.

MR. VAN		You were never sick.

CASSANDRA		Do you want a sip? Helps with all the bullshit.

MRS. VAN		Never.

BABETTE		Here sweetie, a hard chair, good for down there.

CASSANDRA		Jesus, "down there"? How old are you, 92?

MR. VAN		Well, everyone, I'd like to propose a toast.

MARJAN		Right on time.

MR. VAN		"To the young couple. And to our first grandchild, the newest member, Pieter van Kralingen junior."

MRS. VAN		Yeah.

BABETTE		Cheers.

MR. VAN		Cheers.

IEDEREEN		Cheers.

IRIS			Thank you so much for this amazing surprise.

MR. VAN		Sure.

PIETER			So amazing.

IRIS			Pieter also had a surprise for me.

MRS. VAN		He's so sweet.

MR. VAN 

PIETER			Iris.

IRIS		My beloved Pieter. The highly acclaimed dental surgeon wondered if the child was really his.

MRS. VAN	

IRIS		When I was working my ass off for one of my silly reality shows nine months ago I was voluntarily inseminated by a cameraman, according to Pieter. was I secretly stopped taking the pill to start a family with the love of my life. And he was the one who, during my entire pregnancy preferred to put it in someone else. And instead of being there for his son, he's taking that bed pan Suus to Malawi to save other people's sad children.

MRS. VAN		Pieter?

MR. VAN		But… Is this child ours or not?

IRIS		It certainly is mine. And tomorrow I'll register him as Milan Vandenberg. "Father unwanted."

PIETER	

BABETTE		Barry, go get the kids and let's go.

BARRY			Yes.

BABETTE		Sweetie?

CASSANDRA		Come on.

BABETTE		Jesus, Cassandra.

CASSANDRA		Yeah. 

BABETTE		Come on, do you want to sit down?

CASSANDRA		Hi babe.

IRIS			Jesus.

IRIS			I was supposed to breastfeed him.

PIETER		Really? I'd wait a while if I were you. Babette and Cassandra cleaned everything after taking you to bed.

IRIS			And my mother?

PIETER			She left immediately, of course.

IRIS	

PIETER			That's what she always does.

IRIS			Jesus, what a day, right?

IRIS			Where are you going?

IRIS			Boris won't fit in there.

PIETER			Boris was a present. He's yours. And Suus doesn't have a big house.

IRIS			You can't do this, we need to talk.

PIETER		I'm done talking. You always know what you want, anyways.You decide everything for us. Whether we wanted to keep the baby. You ignore everyone, like a spoiled teenager. This is who you are, with your perfect kitchen and designer lamps and way too many rooms.

IRIS		Have you gone insane? What are you saying with "my perfect kitchen"? It also has your espresso maker in there for 9000 euros. And too many rooms? How about that Star Trek room?

PIETER			Star Wars…

IRIS		Three holidays a year. The nicest cars and eating out every night. It is your life as well.

PIETER			Not anymore.

IRIS			Of course, just go away. This is all very normal.

DOUWE		How fun to see you again. Are you lying down immediately? It is nice, isn't it?

IRIS	

DOUWE		Hi. Congrats.

IRIS			Who are you and how did you get our key?

DOUWE		I'm sorry. I'm here to walk Boris. I'm stepping in for Laura, my sister.

IRIS			Okay, great that someone took the time to tell me

DOUWE		Laura texted and e-mailed.

IRIS			And I was busy doing something else.

DOUWE		I get that.

IRIS		Go ahead and take him. It's my ex's dog, so you can keep him, because Suus has a small house. Or take him to the a shelter, if you happen to pass by.

KARIN			Hello.

DOUWE		Hi.

KARIN			I'm the maternity nurse.

DOUWE	

KARIN			And you're the new parents?

IRIS		No, this is the dogwalker. The dad is on top of Suus, as we speak. He's screwing away the trauma of my delivery.

KARIN			Hormones. Yes.

DOUW			Yes, this would be a great contraceptive.

IRIS			I've just given birth, not gone deaf.

DOUWE		Okay, let's go. Come on, Boris.

KARIN			Let's get to work.

IRIS			Piet, I'm sorry. Can you please come home? Please?

KARIN			Yes!

IRIS	

KARIN 			If you have to sneeze, remember to close your legs.

IRIS			Too late. Ouch.

KARIN			There. Time for mother and child. There. Yes. Well…

IRIS			Don't leave.

KARIN			I'll stay here then. Well, this is going great.

IRIS		Babette, oh my God, help. I can't do this. What if I accidentally kill him or if he gets kidnapped?

IRIS		Hey, it's me again. They breathe on their own when they sleep, right? So I don't have to do anything? How should I know? It's my first child, I'm just a bit insecure. And alone. I quit breastfeeding, by the way. It hurt so bad. And I'm exhausted. Can you please, please come by?

IRIS			Shh, calm down.

IRIS			Oh! Fuck. Oh.

KARIN			Take it easy.

IRIS			Well, here we go.

KARIN			It will be fine.

IRIS			Yeah.

IRIS			Oh! Boris

IRIS			Calm down, come on.

IRIS	

IRIS			Let's go.

IRIS			Yes.

BABETTE		Well, how's it going?

CASSANDRA		We're having such a great time.

BABETTE		Pieter?

CASSANDRA		Karin.The maternity nurse has left and refused her friendship request on Facebook twice.

IRIS			(cries)

BABETTE		Oh, sweetie.

IRIS			I thought we had a real connection.

BABETTE		I'm sure Karin is just a bit busy.

CASSANDRA		Well, Milan has been changed and fed, Iris has not.

BABETTE		I brought her favourite, it'll be fine.

CASSANDRA		I brought along a lot of snacks so I don't think she suddenly wants your pasta.

BABETTE		I'm sure she does. It'll all be fine.

CASSANDRA		But it was already fine.

BABETTE		So it can only get better.

CASSANDRA		But it was already amazing.
BABETTE		Great.

CASSANDRA		Yes. 

BABETTE		Just go, you look a bit tired.

CASSANDRA		Yes, I have a really busy life.

BABETTE		Yes, I get that.

CASSANDRA		I have no time to slack off.

BABETTE	

CASSANDRA		Bitch. Well, bye, honey.

CASSANDRA		Bye.

BABETTE		Toodle-oo.

IRIS			(cries)

BABETTE		Sweetie, take a shower, because you smell. I'll take care of everything here. I'll stay with Milan.

IRIS			I don't think so, buddy. Go.

VOICE W		The number you have reached is not in service. Please check the number and dial again.

IRIS			Fuck. Cheers!

CASSANDRA		Wow, nice. Ober. Look. 

IRIS			He needs to come home eventually.

CASSANDRA		And then what?

IRIS		And then we'll get together again. It's all fun and games, but I never wanted to be a single mother.

CASSANDRA		That's never the plan. But sometimes things happen.

IRIS			No, only child, sad mother. Been there, done that.

CASSANDRA		I think it is a good idea to find another father.

IRIS			This is temporary. If he's done with that whore, he'll be back.

CASSANDRA		Hold on, he cheated on you and had an affair during your entire pregnancy and Pieter is just a jerk. He's unsuitable as a partner and certainly as a father.

DOUWE		Hi.  

CASSANDRA		Could we get another bottle?

DOUWE		Iris, right? Good to see you're out of the house.

DOUWE		Douwe... from Boris.

IRIS			Oh, right.

CASSANDRA	

IRIS			Shit, hi.

CASSANDRA		You're not a waiter? I'm sorry. What if I get another bottle, do you want to join us?

DOUWE		I'm here with a colleague, so another time. So, fun. I'll see you later and say hello to your baby for me.

CASSANDRA		Well…

IRIS			He walks the dog.

CASSANDRA		With a "colleague".

IRIS		Another dogwalker. Do you think they had a meeting or a business dinner?

CASSANDRA		Seems like a nice guy.

IRIS			The dogwalker who walks dogs?

CASSANDRA		Well, you tried a doctor. Maybe it's time for a change.

IRIS		Okay, Pieter is an asshole, I know. And what about all the married men and other attached men in your life?

CASSANDRA		Sex and then they're gone again. Nice and quiet. No chance at all at a steady relationship.

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	Seven ounces weight gain. Exactly following the curve. And you? How are you doing?

IRIS			Tired.

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	Everything okay at home?

IRIS			Yes, fine.

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	Are you getting help? The father, parents, friends? It takes a village to raise a child. Take good care of yourself, especially when you've just had a child. I think it's a good idea to take some blood, just to be sure. Iron.

IRIS			Thank you, bye.

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	Mrs Vandenberg? Your baby?

PETER-PAUL		Hey, Vandenberg.

IRIS			PP…

PETER-PAUL		Check-up?

IRIS			Yeah, they had to take some blood. Iron. How are you doing?

PETER-PAUL		Fine.

PETER-PAUL		I'm sure it's not easy.

IRIS			No, it definitely isn't. But, well...

PETER-PAUL		If I can do something for you...

IRIS			You just take care of Pieter, that's your role.

PETER-PAUL	Yeah, you'd think that, but I don't see him a lot anymore. She even took away our coffee breaks. Quality time.

IRIS			Not easy, then.

PETER-PAUL		I have to go to the vending machine.While they're in the coffee corner. Not right now. Iris.

IRIS			Hey.

DANIELLE		Iris.

IRIS			Hey. 

DANIELLE		Stupid bitch, come here.

IRIS			Daantje, ugly whore. Did you miss me?

DANIELLE		Definitely not.

IRIS			Any good gossip the last few months?

DANIELLE		Yep. But all about you.

EWART		Iris, you're back.

IRIS			Yes,

EWART		Weren't you on leave because you had to push out a baby?

IRIS			Correct, pushed the baby out.

EWART		Can't even tell. Okay, meeting in ten minutes about current matters.

DANIELLE		He thinks you're fat.

IRIS			You are fat.

IRIS			No way, you sentimental fool.

DANIELLE		I have a reputation to uphold.

IRIS			I won't tell.

EWART		I've seen this a thousand times. Guys, a bit more original, please. And the editing is terrible as well, can someone take a look at that?

IRIS			Yes, of course, but I will have to take a look at the material.

CLAUDIA		I've already seen the material, so I think it's better if I do it.

IRIS			Of course.

EWART		Well, or-gastronomy with our top chef the fourth season already. Who has ideas?

CLAUDIA		Sexy indiscretions. Or, how to keep him interested. Guilty pleasures, masturbation, cuisine for one.

EWART		Is this still about food?

CLAUDIA		Slow food. How to have more time for other things.

IRIS			Casserole? Not really sexy.

CLAUDIA		He can make cheese fondue sexy.

IRIS			Cheese fondue? It's heavy, it smells, you get bloated as if--

CLAUDIA		You're pregnant?

EWART		Well, we'll go with slow food. Can you do this, Claudia? And can you let Iris know what we've been working on the past few months? Okay. Ewart. Not a problem, I was just in a meeting.

CLAUDIA		I'll e-mail you the rest.

IRIS			Yes. 

CLAUDIA		Well, sweetie, you can go home now. Went pretty well, right?

IRIS			Yes, I was just on maternity leave, not a rehabilitation project.

BART			Iris, ma belle.

IRIS			Hey, Muys.

BART			I really missed you. It was just chaos here without you.

BART		I'm serious. So, what happened to that guy of yours? He's such a stupid jerk. If I was the father of your child, I'd cherish you. I would spoil you every day with nice food. 

BART			And tender love and care in bed.

IRIS			So if you were my husband, I would become bed-ridden and obese.

BART			Right, just come here. Cutie of mine.

IRIS		I could actually use some tender love and care and nice food. My place, next Saturday?

BART			Next Saturday, cool. Yes, great. And I will cook for you.

IRIS			Nice. 

BART			Oh, Iris. Oh oh you make my day. 

DANIELLE		That's my girl. 

IRIS			You're my dog, right? Look at this, old boy.

DOUWE		Storm, come here. Go get it. Yeah, nice job. Come here, nice job.

IRIS			So, that's not a bad life. Giving cookies away in the park.

DOUWE		And they let you out unsupervised?

IRIS	

DOUWE		Hey, do you even like dogs? Go get it.

IRIS			Well...

IRIS		No, I don't think so. Boris was a present from my boyfriend. To stop me from wanting a child. But I think he used it as an excuse to call his mistress while walking the dog.

DOUWE		You mean Suus, who doesn't have a big house.

IRIS		He does have someone who really wants him. I just feel so terribly alone. It would help if everyone wasn't so mean and consider me and my feelings. He really left us. And my mother as well, she always disappears when things get complicated. She drove my dad crazy and he left when I was two. And now it even seems like I've become redundant at work during my leave.

DOUWE		They're all assholes, aren't they?

IRIS			Yes. 

IRIS			But you've done well for yourself. Nice job, not a lot of responsibility.

DOUWE		Actually...

IRIS		And a nice sister to share annoying parents. So, where's Laura? Did she go on holiday? Or did she take a sabbatical?

DOUWE		No. Breast cancer.

IRIS			Oh, shit. 

DOUWE		Yeah, pretty much.

IRIS			Sorry. 

DOUWE		No, it's going well. The operation was successful. But since she has chemo, I try to cover for her as much as I can. It makes me feel that I can at least do something for her.

IRIS		Well, my gosh. Well, we should go. First day at day care is pretty exhausting.

DOUWE		Yes, I get that.

IRIS			Well, have fun at work.

DOUWE		Thank you.

IRIS			Dog. Boris, come. Boris, come here, now. Must be the treats.

DOUWE		Sure. Or your cold personality.

IRIS			Yes. 

DOUWE		I'll take him home.

IRIS			Thank you. 

BART		The trick is not to go too fast. Just take it easy. Just sear it a bit. And then... magic. One by one. All the ingredients.

IRIS	

BART			But not everything at once. What's wrong?

IRIS			Mr TV chef.

BART			You talk about something then.

IRIS			My life is a bit boring.

BART			Your son is not boring, is he?

IRIS			Definitely not, for me. But I don't want to bother you.

BART			Come on, tell me.

IRIS		He's really cute. And he talks all day. To me to the dog and even to his own hands. It's so sweet. Pieter, I wasn't expecting you.

BART			Me neither.

PIETER			Shut the fuck up, Lambik.

IRIS			Bart, I need to talk to Pieter.

BART			Really?

IRIS			Yeah

BART			Okay. 

PIETER		Look at that, Chateau La Mission Haut Brion. A waste, with the way you drink.

IRIS			It's great to see you.

PIETER			Yes. So fun, yes. Where's little Pieter?

IRIS			Milan is not here tonight.

IRIS		"He's doing really good. He loves peek-a-boo. And he seems really impressed by your Star Wars collection. Do you remember New York? Together at the International Toy Fair. Dinner at Nobu. That amazing hotel."

IRIS		Great timing, is she tracking your phone? Hello, nurse slut, this is the ex. Pieter, your behaviour is not normal, the way you left us.You have a son. Every moron can see he looks like you, except for you.

PIETER		I don't see a child here, because he didn't fit your plans tonight. I took a six months' sabbatical, we're leaving for Malawi. Vaccination booklet.

IRIS			Get the hell out. Get out of my house, asshole. I hope you get cholera.

PIETER			Yellow fever.

IRIS			Whatever. Beam me up, Scotty

BABETTE		I did start to worry when you started sniffing coffee cups.

IRIS			I'm fine now. I cleaned the house, it was great.

BABETTE		Can you afford to keep living there?

IRIS			Pieter still pays half of the mortgage.

BABETTE		I would love that, to be alone with the kids.

IRIS			What, you mean without Barry?

BABETTE		Yes, without Barry, please.

IRIS			I thought it was going better.

BABETTE		Well, better... You mean I forgave him for screwing some slut from the bowling alley for months.

IRIS			He chose you.

BABETTE		Well, hooray.

IRIS			If Pieter chose us...

BABETTE		You would have wondered every day if he still loved you or if he's jerking off on those bowling balls of her again. Sometimes I want to push a pillow on his unfaithful face. Look what he made me into. I'm no more than sloppy seconds. A hand-me-down, his second choice.

IRIS			Now, you're his first choice.

BABETTE		Fuck Barry. Nice. Nice, nice, nice. Four dates next week. I'm going crazy.

PETER-PAUL		Jesus, you keep getting more attractive.

IRIS	

PETER-PAUL		How are you doing?

IRIS			I'm doing okay.

PETER-PAUL		Yeah? I'm back to work and it's fun but also exhausting.

IRIS			Have you spoken to Pieter?

PETER-PAUL		Yes, he left yesterday. I have no idea what he's doing.

PETER-PAUL		I'm so sorry for you. For you both. I really don't understand it, you're so amazing. Beautiful, smart, funny.

IRIS			Well, I clearly picked the wrong student.

PETER-PAUL		I wanted to ask you something.

IRIS			Yes? 

PETER-PAUL		It might be a bit inappropriate now.

IRIS			Of course not.

PETER-PAUL		Cassandra, that friend of yours, is she seeing anyone?

IRIS	

PETER-PAUL		I thought we had a connection.

IRIS			Cassandra, of course. No, she's totally alone.

PETER-PAUL		Really? Thank God. I have to go now. Bye.

IRIS			Yeah. 

PETER-PAUL		Bye.

IRIS			Bye.

IRIS			Okay. 

DOUWE		Nice job, come here. Come on, bring it to me. Hey, Boris. The ball is over there, go get it. Go get it.

IRIS			Hi Boris, hey boy.

DOUWE		Hey Iris. 

IRIS			Hi. 

DOUWE		How are you? 

IRIS			I have no idea.

DOUWE		Tell me.

IRIS		No, I'll start complaining again and you come at me with something worse. Cancer. Boom.

DOUWE		Okay, so your life is not as bad as cancer. Well, that's good. 


IRIS			How is Laura doing? 

DOUWE		She's doing fairly well.

IRIS			So she will get better?

DOUWE		Of course. 

IRIS			It's so sweet of you to do this.

DOUWE		These dogs are her life. And their owners are busy and want certainty. So if you're not available, they'll find someone else.

IRIS			Dog people, gross.

DOUWE		So gross.  But, tell me, how are you doing?

IRIS		Well, I thought that my friend Babette was trying to save her relationship after her husband came crawling back after having an affair. But she doesn't want to save anything. She wants to kill Barry and go on as many Tinder dates as possible. And my other friend, Cassandra, the eternal bachelor is probably going to date the best friend of my ex.

DOUWE		Okay. 

IRIS	And I... I am jealous of both of them. I want Pieter to come crawling back, I want to wish he was dead and cheat on him so hard. And I want to be free like Cassandra to start something new with someone. Something new, fresh. Something that's sweet and fun and really exciting.

DOUWE		I get it, I think. But you do have to realise that they're probably jealous of you.

IRIS			Right.. 

DOUWE		Yes, Babette won't get rid of Barry until she actually kills him. And Cassandra doesn't know yet that the very exciting date will eventually end with a very painful separation.

IRIS			Jesus, cynical.

DOUWE		Yes, and all to cheer you up a bit.

DOUWE		Shit, I have to take this. Yes. No, you're not bothering me. Yes, I'm on my way.

IRIS			Hey Boris, come here, boy. 

MARJAN		Yes, you're smiling at me. You're smiling at me.

IRIS			Here you go.

MARJAN		A bottle? I thought you were breastfeeding.

IRIS			Yeah, but a lot didn't go according to plan. Pieter is in Malawi now.

MARJAN		Honey, I can see you had a hard time. But take care of yourself. Why aren't you wearing any make-up? You're so pale. Where is my pretty Iris?

IRIS			I want to know where you were these last five months.

MARJAN		I just couldn't handle it.

IRIS			You couldn't handle it?

MARJAN		Ineke said I should take some time.

IRIS			That spacy bitch with the third eye?

MARJAN		Everyone has a third eye and she's a clinical psychologist who helps me open my sixth chakra. Yours is blocked as well, by the way. Anyway, Ineke told me I should take some time away from you after that mess during that surprise party. All my old issues came back again. nxiety, night sweats, tinnitus.

IRIS		Yeah, I get it. Before you continue, do you have any idea what I went through these past months?

MARJAN		Mom…

IRIS		Before you continue, do you have any idea what I went through these past months?

MARJAN		Of course, it's exactly what happened to me more than 30 years ago. If Pieter comes back, give him a chance.

IRIS			You never liked Pieter.

MARJAN		One of the things I wanted to teach you, was that you need to be independent. And you are. And I'm so proud of you. So proud, sweetie. You know what I really wanted for you? That what happened to me, didn't happen to you.

IRIS			Jesus, Mom.

MARJAN		What?

IRIS		A lot of men leave. But you keep holding on to the fact that you're an abandoned wife.

MARJAN		Sweetie, if Pieter is not coming back and doesn't want you...

IRIS			Like I still want him.

MARJAN		You have to let him be the father. Even if it's not in the way you wanted. But sweetie, he will come back and you should just have some fun.Go get your hair done, dance, put some make-up on. Try some other men. Yes, and I'm here for you. Really, you know I am. And for Milan. Hi, sweetie. Yes.

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	His lower teeth are coming through, that's why he's crying and having diarrhea. He doesn't do it to tease you.

IRIS		Being a single mother is just hard. It's just not like how I imagined it. Nothing is like it should be. 

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	Are there certain rules for it? For life, being a mother? You should let go of every idea of how it should be. Being a mother is almost always different than expected. Being a good, stable parent is something you will learn while doing it. And it doesn't help to keep wallowing.

IRIS			I'm not. A friend of mine told me to let it fester until it comes out.

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	It sounds funny, but as a doctor I'm not a fan. Clean the wound, work on your defence, that really helps. You're almost 30, right?

IRIS	

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	In two weeks, I see. Nice moment to grow up.

IRIS		There we go, sweetie. Let me see. IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TOMORROW, WANT TO COME? FUN, BUT I WILL BE A BIT LATE, OKAY?

IRIS		Hey, who's that? Yes, that's Daddy. "Here, in Monkey Bay, where people have nothing, but are still very positive I realise that I was very busy in the Netherlands but that my life was empty. Pieter van Kralingen and Suzanne Sikkel. Life here feels like I'm finally home. I'll do everything to make these children smile again. I will start arrangements to sell my house as soon as possible There's nothing in the Netherlands for me anymore." HAVE TO POSTPONE PARTY, GOT SICK WILL HAVE A NEW DATE SOON

IRIS			Oh, sweetie.

IRIS			Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday to me

DOUWE		Iris? Hey

IRIS	

DOUWE		Hey, wake up.

IRIS			Pieter...It's my birthday. I'm 30 now.

DOUWE		Wake up, it's me, Douwe.

IRIS			What are you doing here?

DOUWE		I'm going to take you to bed. 

IRIS			Okay. 

DOUWE		Give me your legs.

IRIS			You're such a hero.

DOUWE		Hold on. 

IRIS			For your sister, for me.

DOUWE		Yes. 

IRIS		And for all the dogs who otherwise would have to pee and poop inside.

DOUWE		Let's get you to bed.

IRIS			Ouch. 

BABETTE		But why was he here?

IRIS		I invited him and forgot to cancel. I think. He took care of Milan this morning, at least I think so.

BABETTE		And did something happen?

IRIS			I really don't think so. I think so.

BABETTE		Jesus, you're such an idiot.

IRIS			hahaha. Jesus.

BABETTE		So he was just in the shower?

IRIS			Yes. A naked man. It's been a while.

BABETTE		Not for me. Tinder rules.

IRIS			Did you really have... sex?

BABETTE		Yes. 

IRIS			But what about Barry?

BABETTE		He's not invited.

IRIS			Fuck, I'm so stupid.

BABETTE		No, you're sweet.

IRIS			No, but I just want sex. And I just want to lick that tattoo of him.

BABETTE		So just do it. And ask him if he just wants to put in there a bit. Yeah, put it in there.

IRIS			Great, from dental surgeon to part-time dogwalker.

BABETTE		You won't feel that.

IRIS			But it's not really an upgrade.

BABETTE	

DOUWE		Hey, I... I should be on my way. It was fun.

BABETTE+IRIS	

BABETTE		"It was fun."

IRIS	

BABETTE		Ask him if he wants to...

IRIS			Douwe, I'm sorry. Wait a minute. This was really bad.

DOUWE		What? Those jokes or that I found you wasted, while you're child was sleeping upstairs?
IRIS			Jesus, you don't have to be so rude.

DOUWE		"Everything you do is fun and nothing else is.  Your child needs you, why don't you think about that?"

IRIS		So you're suddenly the expert when it comes to children? Yeah, just go. Just go back to your dogs.

BART		And yes, ladies. Real men like a bit of fat. And real men also know how to prepare it. Prepare everything. HOW'S DOUWE? HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM, SISTER IS BACK

CLAUDIA		I was thinking: Dads on probation. We follow the dads and kids separately. Before and during their release. We'll see if they did what they planned.

IRIS			Or not.

CLAUDIA		Fine, Iris.

IRIS		Children who get disappointed again. That's what you want to see, right? Your ideas are all about misery and failure.

OPNAMELEIDER	This is enough for now, thank you.

CLAUDIA		Oh my God, Bart...

EWART		Iris, nice to hear you speak up again. Too bad it's not really constructive.

IRIS			I'm trying.

EWART		That's really good, but if you don't like it here come up with something else or leave.

BABETTE		So why don't you come up with something yourself?

IRIS		I'm just not inspired right now. And I hate all the ideas that others come up with. Misery TV, watching how other people get destroyed.

CASSANDRA		Isn't that the point of your job?

IRIS			It isn't. And especially not anymore.

CASSANDRA		What? Because you became a mother?

IRIS			Well, maybe.

BABETTE		Don't say that to your boss. It makes you really weak.

CASSANDRA		Yes. 

IRIS			It's the end of the world.

IRIS			So, are we expecting someone?

CASSANDRA		No, why?

IRIS			Oh, so fun. Do you have to invite him every time?

PETER-PAUL		Ladies.

CASSANDRA	

PETER-PAUL		Hi. 

CASSANDRA	

PETER-PAUL		This is such a coincidence. I just...

CASSANDRA		She already knows.

PETER-PAUL		I'll go get some drinks.

IRIS		Be careful with him. You know he's not married. Before you know it, you're in a relationship.

CASSANDRA		No, we're just having fun. It's just fun. I'm going to help him.

IRIS			It was really fun.

MARJAN		I could have stayed over. I'd love to--

IRIS		Thank you very much and I will call you tomorrow. WANNA FUCK? ON MY WAY

IRIS			Mmmm. Come to mama baby. 

BART			So you thought of me. How are you?

IRIS			I'll go check on him.

BART			Do it fast.

IRIS			Don't leave.

BART			I wouldn't dare.

IRIS	

BART	

IRIS		So gross. Milan, what did we agree on? We poop during the day. Yeah, but you didn't. No, and right at the exact moment when Mommy has a gentleman over. And he's a nice gentleman. Judging by the bulge in his pants, Mommy is going to have a great night. And you have to stay quiet, little buddy. And you have to go back to sleep, because what will Mommy do? What will Mommy do? Inspect every corner of the house. Oh my God. Oh, sweetie. Help, help me, please.

BART			What happened?

IRIS			He fell on the floor.

BART			Let's go to the hospital.

BART			I'll park the car.

IRIS			No, just leave. EMERGENCY ROOM

VERPLEGER		You take a seat over there. I will get the doctor.

IRIS			Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

VERPLEGER 		Baby fell of the changing table, is still alert. But the mother isn't, if you know what I mean.

DOUWE		Hello, I'm doctor Drakema. Can you tell me...

IRIS			No. 

DOUWE		Iris. I'm a paediatrician, have been for a while. Dogs are just my hobby.

DOUWE		Can you tell me exactly what happened to Milan?

IRIS			He fell from the changing table.

DOUWE		Did he cry immediately?

IRIS			It took a while.

DOUWE		How long?

IRIS			I don't know. His diapers fell on the ground and he was suddenly gone.

DOUWE		Come on, sit down. Hey, Milan. Did you fall down?

IRIS	

DOUWE		This happens a lot. More often than you think.

DOUWE		Can I took a look at your eyes? I can, right? Come on, let me take a look. And the other one as well? Yes, nice job.

IRIS			Nice job.

DOUWE		We'll do some tests, okay? Can I touch his arms?

IRIS			Yes. 

DOUWE		Come here. The other one…

IRIS			And now you're a doctor. Just to make me feel even worse.

DOUWE		Yeah, it took some years to graduate, but everything for Iris. Get a CT and an X-ray to be safe and see if they can do it now.

VERPLEGER		Alright.

DOUWE		It will be fine.

IRIS			Yeah. 

DOUWE	

IRIS			It will all be fine. There we go, sweetie.

DOUWE	

MARJAN		Yes, we're back home.

IRIS			Thanks, Mom.

MARJAN		Not at all, sweetie. What a mess. Well, a nice cup of tea. Take a seat, it will all be fine.

IRIS			I'm fine now and Milan is fine as well. You can go.

MARJAN		Take a seat. Didn't you hear me? Come on, sweetie, I will put him to bed. Come on, honey. There, you're coming with grandma. You're getting heavy.

MARJAN		There we go.

IRIS			Yes. 

MARJAN		I think we should talk about men now.

IRIS			It's a bit late to talk to me about sex now.

MARJAN		Sweetie, in the last years I noticed that you never really listened to Pieter. You simply projected your own fantasies and desires onto him. Look, the outside world is a mirror of the inside world. You create situations in your life that validate your own feelings.

IRIS			This is Ineke talking.

MARJAN		No, I'm talking. To you. 

IRIS		Okay, well, bring it on. What kind of outside world have I created and how do I see myself?

MARJAN		A child without a father, to start with.

MARJAN		This is for you.

MARJAN		Read it. CONGRATULATIONS LOVE, DAD

IRIS			Casta. Is that the woman he left us for?

MARJAN		A man.

IRIS			He was gay?

MARJAN		Apparently.

MARJAN		You can say that again. But he didn't leave us, he left me. He wrote to you from day one and I've always ignored him. I loved him so much. And I loved our family and was so embarrassed. All I kept thinking was: How bad a wife do you have to be to turn your husband gay.

IRIS			He already was gay.

MARJAN		Yes, I know that now. But the first years I was so full of resentment. I felt helpless, betrayed and dirty. I made it so difficult for him. And it was already really hard for him. His coming out, his very religious parents who didn't accept him. He eventually fled to Spain with Casta. He started a B&B. Arco Iris.

IRIS			Really? 

MARJAN		Yes. Arco Iris means "rainbow".

IRIS			Jesus, that's so gay.

MARJAN		He always kept writing and hoping I would let him back into your life. And when you were six, I told him he could come visit with Casta. He wrote to me it was the happiest day of his life.

IRIS			So why didn't they come?

MARJAN		They didn't make it. They died in an accident. In Spain, on the way to the airport. They were driving some really old car.

IRIS			Why didn't you tell me sooner?

MARJAN		I was ashamed of myself. I was so ashamed and I'm so sorry. And I'm sorry I stayed mad at him for so long and didn't deal with it. But sweetie, look at me. You're so much stronger, smarter and more independent than I was. I am so proud of you. Don't make the same mistakes as me, please. Give Pieter a chance to be in Milan's life and move on. Without resentment. Oh, honey. Sweetie, I am so sorry. Oh, sweetie. I am so sorry. Oh, look at that. There we go, the sixth chakra. It has suddenly opened up.

IRIS		(cries) Fuck it. Yes, I was just throwing it out. What do you want from me Sweetheart, I know you can't read this card yet. But hopefully you like the picture.  We broke open the room with a sledge hammer today. And I felt myself get happier with every stone we removed. When the wall was gone, I felt so light. As if I dealt with a lot of other things while using that hammer." Whoops. Like father, like daughter.


IRIS		A show in which people deal with their pain and grief by hitting something. Squash It. We'll recreate the situation or a symbol of that situation with a decor. The school where you had a terrible time, the bedroom with your cheating husband. 

EWART		The trash can they stuffed you in during recess.

IRIS		Exactly. Or the desk of that awful boss. Or the decorated room for your birthday party when no one showed up.

EWART		Yes. It's a really good idea. Do it, start making a pilot.

IRIS		Feelings, emotions you can't hold in any longer. Memories, relief. No longer a victim but taking control of your own life and suffering. The participant chooses a souvenir to take home. Another symbolic piece will be displayed in the museum of Squash it. People can literally and figuratively leave a peace of their suffering behind.

MARJAN		Milan, come to grandma.

IRIS	

MARJAN		What do you have there? Girls, enjoy yourselves in Spain.

BABETTE		Yes.

IRIS			Yes.

BABETTE		No worries.

MARJAN		Bye, Mommy.

IRIS			One more kiss. One more.

MARJAN		Just go, you're just making it harder. Go and have fun.

IRIS			Bye. 

BABETTE		I likey, likey. 

IRIS			Keep your cooch in your pants, we're not there yet. It's an island.

BABETTE		No, no. 

BABETTE		Jesus, another bumpy road?

IRIS			Look around, it's gorgeous.
BABETTE		I'd rather just look in front me. Stop the car.

IRIS			Remember the deposit.

IRIS			Are you okay?

BABETTE		A deposit? Did you pay a deposit for this clunker?

IRIS			Come on Babs. We're almost there.

BABETTE		No way, I'm not getting back in. Go ahead, I'll walk. I'll start an IV of  margarita's.

IRIS			Are you sure?

BABETTE		Yes, bye.

IRIS			Okay. 

IRIS			Okay.

IRIS			Uh, no, no, my, my father. Uh, uh, padre. 

SPAANSE		Yes. 

IRIS			René van Amerongen?

SPAANSE		Who? 

IRIS			René van Amerongen.

SPAANSE		Just write it down.

BABETTE		Write it down.

IRIS			Right. Rene van Amerongen

SPAANSE		Van Amerongen

SPAANSE		I found him. Normally people lay here for 20 years. After 20 years…

IRIS		Ah, so, his, his grave is, is gone? My father is, is gone? Uhm, uh, disappeared.?

SPAANSE		Yes.  I'm sorry. I'm really very sorry. But he'll always be in your heart.

IRIS			Jesus, another disappointment.

BABETTE		But it doesn't really matter. Look at it, they're just a bunch of rocks. What were you hoping for?

IRIS			I don't know, I wanted to be closer to him.

BABETTE		Yeah. 

BABETTE		(in Spanish:) Tu Padre, no aqui. En corazon. En telebanco. Y cerveza. En jamon! 

IRIS			Jamon! Hahaha.

BABETTE	

IRIS			(in Spanish:) Bajo, bajo. Veinte años

BABETTE		I do think it is good we came here. When your past changes, if it's not what you thought it was everything changes.

IRIS			It explains a lot. My mother's behaviour.

BABETTE	

IRIS			The way I look at men.

BABETTE		Don't be like your mother. Take control of your own destiny.

IRIS			So I should go on Tinder?

BABETTE		I miss Barry. I think I want him back.

IRIS			That's sudden. Did something change?

BABETTE		Me, I guess. -I have had time to process things now.

IRIS			With Tinder revenge sex.

BABETTE		They're all such weirdos.

IRIS			Like you were so sane.

BABETTE		You're right. But I will no longer be the sad, dependant woman.

IRIS			Good for you. Ha. 

BABETTE		To love?

IRIS			To love. 

BABETTE		This is not as fun.

IRIS			Yeah, I was much more fun when I drank myself into a stupor.

IRIS			Nice view.

DOUWE		Not bad, right?

IRIS	

DOUWE		Iris? Iris? 

BABETTE 		Iris? 

IRIS			Oh my God.

BABETTE		Did you have a nice dream?

IRIS		Mwah… DR. DOUWE DRAKEMA PAEDIATRICIAN EMPLOYMENT HISTORY ADDITIONAL POSITIONS HEAD COORDINATOR EMMA TV

voice over 		Hello everyone, thanks for watching Emma TV

BABETTE		Emma TV? Does that still exist?

IRIS	

BABETTE		I was interviewed once, when I went to the hospital for my tonsils. Was the highlight of my youth.

IRIS		I tried to get pneumonia for two weeks. I was so jealous after you did that.

BABETTE		Really? 

IRIS			YeaH.

BABETTE		That's so sweet.

JUANITO		Hello, ladies.

IRIS			Hello. 


JUANITO		I am Juanito. So you beautiful lady’s like banana?

BABETTE		Stop looking.

JUANITO		Ha. Banana? You like to go on my banana? 

BABETTE		Ah, hahaha. Yes, yes. I want to go on, uh, your banana. 

JUANITO		You want to go on my banana so let's go!

IRIS			What about Barry?

BABETTE		Yes, mañana, mañana. So I go in the front? Okay. 

IRIS			Wait for me, wait. I want to come. WELCOME HOME, MOMMY

BARRY			Look who it is.

IRIS			Hey, sweetie.

IRIS			Hey, Boris. We're back home.

EWART		Vandenberg, congratulations. SBS has just ordered eight episodes.

IRIS			Wow, that's so cool.

EWART		This could be huge, so go ahead and find yourself a new handbag.

IRIS			As a reward for myself, as a woman. A handbag.


EWART		No, because I see you carrying them. But do what you want with the bonus. Buy an iron, for all I care. But what I meant to say, is that I'm proud of you.

IRIS		I am also really happy with the new show but I would like to do something else as well. A contribution to Emma TV, for the children's hospital. I would like to do more than simply entertain people. Which is also extremely important. It doesn't have to cost a lot and it's really good for Media Sharks. Socially relevant, corporate social responsibility. I have two tickets for the Emma fundraising night. Maybe we can start networking there. Not a problem with your charisma, right?

EWART		Dress code summer vibe?

IRIS			Fun for the children.

EWART		Should I wear my swim shorts?

IRIS			No, sunglasses are enough.

SPRAYMEISJE		Wow, pubic hair.

IRIS		Yes, I'm an adult woman, not a toddler. I have a party tonight and barely had any sun this year, so I need a spray tan.

SPRAYMEISJE		I think medium is the best choice.

IRIS		No, make it dark. Make it Saint-Tropez. It will enhance my beautiful smile.

SPRAYMEISJE		Whatever you want.

CLAUDIA		Sorry, hold on a minute. You're orange.

IRIS			Hooray, you're here too.

CLAUDIA		Sweetie, did you let Trump know you stole his tan?

IRIS			Claudia, I see you thought the dress code was happy hooker.

CLAUDIA		At least I look happy.

IRIS			Like a dog. Unable to filter your emotions.

CLAUDIA		I can filter like the best of them. Step up your game, bitch!

IRIS			Did you sell a show to SBS? No. Boom. 

DOUWE		That much? No way. 

IRIS			Hi. 

DOUWE		Sorry, that's Iris. This is Daphne, ambassador for the children's hospital.

DAPHNE		Hello. 

IRIS			Nice to meet you, hello.

DAPHNE		I'll speak to you later.

DOUWE		Yes, that's fine. What are you doing here?

IRIS			Networking.

DOUWE		And you came as an Oompa-Loompa.

IRIS			I just think orange is a really festive colour.

DOUWE		You're such an idiot.

IRIS			Thank you for you professional diagnosis, dr. Free Willy.

DOUWE		How are Milan and Boris?

IRIS			Fine. A lot of poop. Really a lot of poop.

DOUWE		And how are you?

IRIS			Getting better and better.

DOUWE		Good, that's nice to hear.

IRIS		I'm sorry I said all those weird things to you and about you. And that I dropped my child.

DOUWE		No problem. You shouldn't do that last thing again, because I will have to call CPS and that's such a hassle.

EWART		Iris. Well, I didn't recognize you. Nice colour, did you come as a carrot?

DOUWE	

EWART		This is such a great party.

IRIS			This is Ewart Staring, my boss.

DOUWE	

IRIS			This is Douwe Drakema.

EWART		Ewart. 

DOUWE		Douwe. 

IRIS			He's the driving force behind Emma TV.

DOUWE	

IRIS		Yes, Mr Drakema, we think you do amazing work. And we would like to  to that as Media Sharks.

DOUWE		Well, we should talk about that sometime.

EWART		Amazing. Let's get another drink, the same for everyone? Walk with me, I want to discuss some ideas. Sick children are not really sexy.

CLAUDIA		Ouch. Sorry. 

IRIS		Crawling, standing up, he picks up things. He almost got hold of a cigarette bud outside. I mean he already put it in his mouth.

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	Give him a drink and it's Friday night.

IRIS			Yes. 

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	And you seem to be doing well also.

IRIS		Yes, pretty good. My job is going amazing, I sold a show to SBS. And I'm working on a special project for Emma TV. And Milan and me are having fun together. We found our way together and I'm still learning every day as a mom.

DOCTOR KURTOGLU	And now you'll get the toddler puberty.	

IRIS			(voices on te background, not plot pertinent… )

DOUWE		(voices on te background, not plot pertinent… )

IRIS			(voices on te background, not plot pertinent… )

DOUWE		(voices on te background, not plot pertinent… )

IRIS			Hi. 

ELLA			Hi. 

IRIS			Are you looking forward to it?

ELLA			I am.

IRIS			Nice. 

DOUWE		Allright, ms Vandenberg, I am ready for my close-up.

IRIS			Is your trailer okay or do you need more roses?

DOUWE	

IRIS			Or do you want chocolate peanuts without peanuts?

DOUWE	

IRIS			Half-naked ladies?

DOUWE		Good luck. 

IRIS			You too. 

DOUWE		Hey, how's it going?

ELLA			So you like him?

IRIS			What? 

ELLA			Doctor Douwe. 

IRIS			What? No, why? Did he say something? 

ELLA			No. 

IRIS		Is it that obvious? I still have to get used to the fact that I like him. I mean, let's be honest. He's just really sexy. There's definitely a physical attraction. But, I don't know. It's more than that. It's a real match intellectually as well. That might be a bit shallow now that I know he's a doctor. But I'm sure he sees me as an idiot with a big mouth. And I am a bit. Or were. Well, I still am.

ELLA			Don't make it so difficult, just ask him out for of coffee.

IRIS	

DOUWE		Oh, I can have your Xbox? How sweet.

KINDEREN		No. 

DOUWE		I'm just kidding.

KINDEREN	

DOUWE		I would never do that. He'd come and find me when he's big and strong. And who yelled the loudest? Such a sweet girl with such a big mouth. Ella. Tell me, what would you like to have?

ELLA			A robot to change your colostomy bag.

DOUWE		A colostomy bag robot. That's a great idea. Didn't you make up a poem the other day? Do you still remember it?

ELLA		Yes. I wish I was a glow-worm,hen I would never be glum. Because how can you be sad when you have the sun

KINDEREN		Hahahaha. 

DOUWE		Yes, nice job.

IRIS			And that's a wrap.

DOUWE		That means we did really good. Applause. Nice job, guys.

IRIS			That's so cute.

DOUWE		Me? No, they're amazing. Ella is amazing, but they all are.

IRIS			So, do you want to grab a coffee together?

DOUWE		That's going to be difficult, because I have to get back to work.

IRIS			Another time? My treat, of course. You can even get a snack. 

DOUWE		Haha

IRIS			An apple pie or something savoury. Or I give you the money to go

DOUWE		Haha

IRIS			Or I give you the money to go and grab a coffee with someone else.

DOUWE		I don't know if... You and me is not such a good idea. I know that doesn't sound friendly, but… You're a bit…

IRIS			Of an idiot?

DOUWE		Confused. And I tend to want to fix that. My sister always tells me I want to save the whole world. And it's pretty exhausting.

IRIS		But I'm not looking for someone to save me. That's the whole point. I'm saving myself. For the first time in my life I know what I'm doing and why.

DOUWE		Good for you.

IRIS		Good for you? Akward… And a little bite for Milan. Nice job. And some for Mommy. Do you also want quinoa with vegetables next time? Little rascal.

PIETER		Hi Iris.  Can I come inside? I don't know where to start to try and make it up to you I really acted like an asshole.

IRIS			Come inside. Milan Pieter Vandenberg. 

PIETER			Pieter?  Hello. Hey, little guy. Hello, Milan.

DOUWE		I'm here for Boris. I could've let myself in, but I thought maybe you want to join me. Just walk the dogs together. And maybe we could get a cup of coffee somewhere. I realised that there's no saving you anymore. You do exactly what you want. And I want nothing more than to go down with you.

DOUWE		But coffee first, I think.

PIETER		Oh, the dogwalker, nice. Boris needs to run outside, he was so agitated last night. Boris, come here. Here you go. Come on. Thank you.

DOUWE		Boris, come with me.

PIETER		Hey, nice job. Hey, now that you're loaded, we can start our next Star Wars collection. That's really nice, because that was the best part. Travel the world together, go to trade shows, have dinner at Nobu.

IRIS			Piet, this is perfect. I'm really glad you're here.

PIETER			Yes. 

IRIS		But we're not getting back together. I hope you'll take the time to get to know Milan, because he is really special. And now I'm going to walk the dog and I'm sure you know what I mean.

PIETER			You're leaving? Now? What about Milan? I know nothing about babies.

IRIS		Call your parents, they're more than welcome. And maybe you can drive home with them.

IRIS	

CLAUDIA		Girl, are you in a hurry?

IRIS			Claudia, yes, very much.

BARISTA 1		Hi. 

CLAUDIA		I want to change my order. What kind of milk do you have?

BARISTA 1		Skimmed, full, oat milk, rice milk, goat's milk, soy milk.

CLAUDIA		No hemp or quinoa? Macadamia milk?

IRIS		I want to tell the love of my life that he's the love of my life. Long story not enough time, but I do need coffee. Two, please.

BARISTA 1		Aww.

CLAUDIA		Yes, it so sweet. But it's my turn.

IRIS			Yes. 

CLAUDIA		So, about the coffee. Can you recommend something, something you like to drink? Something really popular, which makes people say:  "Wow, this is so amazing, I can drink it every day." Like that movie Harry Met Sally in which everyone sees her drink something which she really, really likes and then they say this. I’ll have what she is having. 

BARISTA 2		Coffee?

IRIS			Yes.

BARISTA 2		Doesn't matter what kind?

IRIS			No. That's amazing. 

BARISTA 2		Here you go. They're on me. Good luck.

IRIS			So sweet. We'll call our love child after you. Barista.

CLAUDIA		Those were mine.

BARISTA 2		Maybe she should name her child after you. Nasty bitch.

IRIS			Bye. 

CLAUDIA		Wauw

IRIS			Oké, uh. Oeh. Oeh. Whoe! Eh! Eeeh! Oeh.

ZORAYA		Stop, we're going to help you.

IRIS			Holy fuck, no.

ZORAYA		Yes. We are women and we look out for each other.

IRIS			Not necessary, I've got it.

ZORAYA		No, no. We'll give you a ride. I assume someone is waiting for that drink?

IRIS			Jesus, yes. Okay.

BIERFIETS		Here we go again. Beer and titties, lalala. Wine and willies, lalala

IRIS			Stop. I'll give my spot to other women in need. Thank you.

ZORAYA		Good luck.

BIERFIETS 		Bye. 

ZORAYA		Okay, girls. Let's go for it.

BIERFIETS		Whoo!

IRIS			Hey Boris. Hey. 

DOUWE		Are you stuck? I used to always get stuck when I went up to my treehouse.

MOTHER IN PARK	Hello. What are you doing? Taking coffee on a jungle gym is so dangerous for kids.

IRIS			It's fine, it's not even hot anymore.

MOTHER IN PARK	I don't think so.

IRIS			Hey. 

MOTHER IN PARK	Do you have a child?

IRIS			At home, with his dad.

MOTHER IN PARK	Sure. People without children in a playground are suspicious.

IRIS			Look, a guy in a raincoat is handing out double espresso's to children.

DOUWE		One, two. Three. Is it still attached, does it hurt or is it not that bad? I hope… You're welcome.

MOTHER IN PARK	You with the coffee. I'm calling the police right now.

IRIS		Well, I got your attention. You need to be fast, because the cops and the psychiatrists are on their way.

DOUWE		Hi. 

IRIS		I'm Iris Vandenberg. Mother. Reasonably successful TV producer. Part time idiot and since a short while completely alcohol free. I would love to get to know you better while drinking a cup of coffee.

IRIS		Sorry for this. But mostly for just now, at my place. That was Pieter, my ex. He slept on the couch last night. And will hopefully be a father for Milan from now on. I should have said something right away. But he's not my boyfriend, because I'm still very single.

DOUWE		Good. 

IRIS		As in "good, she doesn't deserve any better" or "good, now I can ask her to go steady"?

DOUWE		Wow.

IRIS			No problem, we can discuss it later.

DOUWE		So, now you want to lick my tattoo?

IRIS			Seriously.

DOUWE		I thought you were crazy because of the alcohol.

IRIS			No, that's just who I am.

MOTHER IN PARK	That's unsafe. Hello? That's unsafe. That's not done, that coffee.

IRIS			Ha

ZORAYA		Hey, coffee girl. You go girl!

BIERFIETS 		Wooh!

MOTHER IN PARK	I've reported that they're kissing here.

IRIS			Are you comfortable?

DOUWE		Hum

CASSANDRA		No. no. no…

MARJAN		Look at that. What a beautiful cake, darling.

IRIS			It's snowing again.
