ISSIE	What’s wrong with her?

TOM	The wound’s infected, but she won’t let me clean it.

TOM	You could help, it would be good practice.

ISSIE	Practice?

DAN	Yeah, I’m training to be a vet.

MITCH	Do you have any idea what Hexronn’s gonna do to this town?

ISSIE	What are we talking about?

MITCH	Sam. Your mother’s fancy footing with him.

ISSIE	You’re here again. What do you want from me?

TOM	Issie. What are you doing?

ISSIE	Look Tom, she’s doing it.

ISSIE	Other way Blaze.

STELLA	How did she do that?

TOM	If you want to help, it’s gonna be a lot of work. Every day.

TOM	Hey.

ISSIE	Blaze looks much better today.

TOM	Yeah, she’s healing up pretty good. Could you go and help the others set up for the family fun day?

ISSIE	Oh, yeah. Ok. So, after that, I was wondering if, maybe it would be a good time to, ride her?

TOM	Ride her?

ISSIE	Yeah. Blaze.

TOM	You don’t just get on her. You got to get her used to the saddle. Start her slowly. Saddle cloth.

ISSIE	Mmm hmm. Ok. Ok yeah, sounds good. So, should we do that then?

TOM	If I say yes, will you leave me alone?

ISSIE	Done.

TOM	No, no, no, no, no. Try it again. Remember you can’t creep up on a horse, you’ve got to stay in her eyeline.

ISSIE	Yeah, yeah, ok.

TOM	Ok slowly, slowly, set…

TOM	…just let her settle, try again.

ISSIE	This isn’t working, we’ve been here for ages.

TOM	I told you, it takes time. You need patience with horses.

CAROLINE	Yeah cos horses can tell everything you’re thinking.

CALEB	Everyone can tell what you’re thinking Caroline, it’s always coming out of your mouth.

ISSIE	It’s ok Blaze, you can trust me.

CAROLINE	Wipe out.

ISSIE	I got it on though.

TOM	That’s not the point. This isn’t something you win. It’s a partnership.

ISSIE	Well, maybe Blaze doesn’t like saddle cloths, why don’t I try riding bareback?

TOM	Issie, this isn’t gonna happen.

ISSIE	Oh, but Tom.

TOM	No, you haven’t even sat on a horse yet.

ISSIE	Thanks for letting me do this. Once Tom sees me riding, he’ll have to let me ride Blaze. No offence Blue.

DAN	Can’t be long though, Kayleigh’s on her way.

ISSIE	Who’s that? Girlfriend?

DAN	Student. Yeah, she’s in an event at the family fun day tomorrow. Alright, foot in the stirrup.

ISSIE	Let’s do this. Let’s get this riding thing nailed.

ISSIE	See, easy.

DAN	Alright.

ISSIE	Why aren’t we going anywhere?

DAN	Kick him on.

DAN	Shorten your reins, like how I showed you.

ISSIE	I have.

DAN	No you haven’t, look at them.

ISSIE	Look, I don’t think it’s the reins.

DAN	What?

ISSIE	I think Blue just doesn’t get me.

DAN	Just, tell him what you want him to do.

ISSIE	Ok, fine. Go on Blue, gallop, go on.

DAN	No. Do what I showed you.

ISSIE	I did. It’s not, working.

DAN	You didn’t and… look, hop off, I gotta go.

ISSIE	But we haven’t got anywhere yet.

DAN	Yeah, that’s not my problem. I’m being assessed tomorrow and it’s my last chance to work with Kayleigh.

ISSIE	Assessed, for what?

DAN	A teaching qualification.

ISSIE	Yeah, good luck with that.

DAN	What’s that supposed to mean?

ISSIE	Well you didn’t teach me anything.

DAN	Yeah, ‘cause you’re not listening.

ISSIE	Well maybe it’s because you’re not a very good teacher.

DAN	It’s a two-way street Issie. Oh, and for the record, if you think Tom’s ever gonna let you ride Blaze, you are crazy.

ANISHA	I mean, if you ask me, it sounds like Tom’s totally playing you.

ISSIE	Really?

ANISHA	And like, it’s outrageous he won’t let you ride your horse. It’s like, weren’t you the only one who could get her in the stall and basically saved her life?

ISSIE	Exactly.

ANISHA	Sounds to me like everyone’s just jealous cos you’re gifted.

ISSIE	D’you think?

ANISHA	Totally, you should show them.

MITCH	What are you up today, love?

ISSIE	Going to the stables.

MITCH	You gonna be at the Family Fun Day?

ISSIE	Yeah. I guess.

AMANDA	Morning.

MITCH	Back on the job hunt today?

AMANDA	No.

MITCH	Oh.

AMANDA	I didn’t realise that my law degree would count for basically zero.

MITCH	Oh, that’s a headache, love.

AMANDA	Actually, I might, pop along with you to, Fun Day, if that’s ok?

MITCH	Have you done your hair?

AMANDA	No.

MITCH	I didn’t think horses were your thing.

AMANDA	Yeah, well I mean, you know?

MITCH	No.

AMANDA	What do you, what have you got there exactly?

MITCH	Nothing.

AMANDA	What’re you up to?

MITCH	What’re you up to?

ISSIE	Why is my family so weird?

CALEB	No, Caroline, come on, everyone’s getting ready. Hurry up.

CAROLINE	Here?

CALEB	Line it up, no, this way, this way.

CAROLINE	It’s fine.

CALEB	This way…

CAROLINE	Let’s go get ready.

DAN	Mum, where’s my logbook, I need it for the assessment.

MIRIAMA	Yeah, it’s in the bag.

KENNY	Yeah, I’m not gonna be racing, I’m not gonna be riding any horses today.

BIANCA	This place is, the worst. We’re gonna totally destroy them.

BIANCA	Ah, Hamish, hi we’re like really big fans, can we please have a photo with you?

HAMISH	Yeah, of course.

STELLA	Hamish’s matches always run late.

HEATHER	Don’t worry ok? We’ll be here.

STELLA	That’s what you always say.

HEATHER	We’ll be back in time for your race. Go get ‘em.

HAMISH	Hey Stel.

HAMISH	See you later, stink bomb.

STELLA	Don’t drop the ball, fish face.

ISSIE	Hey Blaze. You and me, we’re good right? Ok.

ISSIE	All right, stay, Blaze.

ISSIE	Blaze. Ahh.

ISSIE	Blaze. Stop. Stop, Blaze, Blaze.

TOM	What are you doing?

ISSIE	She just went nuts.

DAN	You tried to ride her.

TOM	I told you she wasn’t ready.

ISSIE	But, I…

TOM	Come on, woah girl.

TOM	Woah, woah, woah. Come on. That’s it.

ISSIE	What? You done gawping at the freak show guys?

NATASHA	Excuse me?

ISSIE	Why don’t you all run along to your pathetic, lame little pony show.

NATASHA	I’m sorry but if anyone’s pathetic it’s you…

TOM	Alright you lot, go and tack up.

NATASHA	But.

TOM	Go. Now.

TOM	Not you.

ISSIE	Look Tom, I don’t know what happened. But it really wasn’t my fault. I’m ready to ride her, I know I am.

TOM	Just because you want to ride her doesn’t mean you’re ready. I’ve had enough of your selfish attitude.

ISSIE	What?

TOM	You’ve got an ego problem, you don’t listen so you’re dangerous, you’ve got no place being around horses.

ISSIE	But Tom.

TOM	I don’t want you here. Go home Issie.

SAM	Julia, you’ve still got some quite, major questions and I can’t get a straight answer out of anyone, so I would really appreciate it if you just give me a call back. Please.

AMANDA	Sam, hi, hey.

SAM	Hello.

AMANDA	Can I, get you, coffee?

SAM	Oh no, no, you’re alright.

AMANDA	Um, listen, I’m sorry about the other day, sorry if I was a bit, weird, I think I was over-caffeinated.

AMANDA	Oh, there I go again. Stand back. Yeah. Um, what it was, was that my mum, she was like winding me up saying that our coffee was actually a date, which…

SAM	Which would be, terrible?

AMANDA	No, no, um, it’s just that I, I wasn’t sure if I was sort of, like, quite ready and then, I just, I got myself into a bit of a, state. Sorry.

SAM	So just to be clear, you don’t want to go on a date?

AMANDA	No. No, yes. Yes, I don’t, I don’t not, want to go on a date. I mean, I do want to go on a date if you, if you, do?

SAM	Ok. Ok.

AMANDA	Yeah. Ok.

SAM	How about I buy you a drink and then we’ll, we’ll call this a date?

AMANDA	Yes. Yes, let’s have this date. Ha, ha.

SAM	Another one of those?

AMANDA	Better not.

KENNY	Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome along to the Kauri Point Family Fun Day.

KENNY	Thanks mum. And for those of you who don’t know who I am. Where have you been? I’m Kenny Burford, your friend, and Mayor. Now, before we get started, I wanted to introduce you to a great friend of mine, a great guy, and sponsor of this event. Mr Sam Tucker.

SAM	Hi there. Thanks everyone for coming. Please feel free to help yourself to a bottle of water, courtesy from the good folks at Hexronn.

SAM	I, I know there was a bit of talk when I decided to merge with such a big company, but, I can assure you that this will be fantastic for our community and Fantail Pure Water will continue to be a company that puts the environment first.

KENNY	Well said Sam. He’s a handsome bloke, isn’t he? Look out ladies. Hey nice pants, where did you get those from?

NATASHA	Poor Blaze. Issie’s so full of herself.  She really believes she’s got some special connect.

TOM	Well she does have something.

NATASHA	Really? I mean she doesn’t like even ride.

TOM	She doesn’t do herself any favours, that’s for sure but she’s got raw talent. Your race is starting soon. Don’t be long, eh.

NATASHA	Why does everyone think she’s so freaking gifted?

NATASHA	Woah, I didn’t mean to scare you, easy. Calm down Blaze, it’s ok.

NATASHA	No Blaze, no. Come back.

MITCH	Issie. Issie.

ISSIE	Gran?

MITCH	Over here. In the loo.

ISSIE	What are you doing?

MITCH	This town is in serious jeopardy, Issie.

ISSIE	Ok.

MITCH	If you want people to sit up and take notice you gotta give them a little razzmatazz. Problem is I’ve got myself hooked on the flusher.

ISSIE	Look Gran, I need to go, if Tom catches me…

MITCH	I need you to pull me out. Give me a good yank.

MITCH	That’s it, that’s it.

MITCH	That was like being born.

MITCH	You’re gonna have to flip me over Issie.

ISSIE	Roll over.

MITCH	That’s it, that’s it, now pull, pull.

MITCH	Now, I need your help Issie.

ISSIE	Ok, fine. Where do you want to go?

MITCH	That’s my girl. Right, come on then.

ISSIE	Oh Gran. Careful.

KENNY	Ok, ready for a spot of jousting. Sounds painful. The riders are taking to the pitch, court, arena, whatever it’s called, not really a horse man myself, more of a sports car man.

CAROLINE	Dad.

NATASHA	Kenny’s on fire.

CALEB	Yep, so proud.

KENNY	…and looking very smart there, the Dulmoth ladies and gents, it’s quite hard to tell under those hats. Henry the Eighth was in fact a, wonderful jouster, just speculating there…

CAROLINE	Who are you looking for?

STELLA	My family.

CAROLINE	Oh, does that mean Hamish is coming?

MITCH	Ok. Listen up everybody. Hexronn are stealing our water.

KENNY	Hang on, what’s going on here?

ISSIE	Gran, stop.

CAROLINE	Is that Issie?

NATASHA	She’s such an attention seeker.

MITCH	And, that’s the man, there. Sam Tucker, who’s letting it happen.

AMANDA	Oh mum.

MIRIAMA	Some people really appreciate the jobs you know, Mitch.

KENNY	What are you supposed to be Mitch? A pencil?

JUDGE	I think she’s a bottle.

KENNY	Oh yeah, you’re a bottle, oh, very clever.

MITCH	Hexronn are gonna take ten times the amount of water. That’s ten times the trucks, it’s ten times the carbon emissions.

KENNY	Come on Mitch, put a cork in it.

MITCH	This is our water, and nobody has asked us what we think. My granddaughter deserves a future.

MITCH	When I say Hexronn, you say, no. Hexronn.

KENNY	No.

MITCH	That’s the spirit Kenny.

KENNY	No, I’m saying no, ‘cause I want you to stop.

MITCH	Hexronn, no.

MITCH	Issie, run.

KENNY	This is exciting.

ISSIE	Gran, what are you doing?

MITCH	Get away. That was a legal protest…

JAKE	Here we go.

MITCH	Help, help, I’m being silenced. No. Get off me.

KENNY	Thank you officials. I’m sure we all agree that she certainly had some bottle. Hah.

MITCH	Get your hands off me. I need to look after my granddaughter.

KENNY	Anyway, let’s get back to the race. I’ve got a sports massage at six and it’s non-refundable. On your marks, set…

KENNY	And they’re off…

KENNY	…Dulmoth Park looking very good, but Kauri Point, did they hear the thing?

NATASHA	Aramis.

NATASHA	Go, go, go.

KENNY	Oh, there they are, no, they’re off too. That’s Natasha Tucker, finally galloping towards the target. Each rider must knock these targets down and then return to the team as quickly as possible.

MITCH	I feel I’ve been on fire. Oh, hey, you’re not going anywhere, you stick with Grammy. That’s my girl.

NATASHA	Come on Caleb.

KENNY	And next out of the gate for Kauri Point is Caleb Burford, and yes, no coincidence he’s my son.

MITCH	Are you ok love?

ISSIE	Yeah, I think, just got a bit of a headache.

KENNY	Would you believe it? Kauri Point are neck and neck with Dulmoth Park, six times champions.

CAROLINE	Yes Caleb, yes, yes, yes.

CALEB	Stella. Stella.

CAROLINE	Stella, are you ok? What are you waiting for?

STELLA	My family, I don’t want to ride until they’re here.

KENNY	Kauri Point in some trouble there.

ISSIE	Oh no.

KENNY	Heavens to Betsy, a rare mistake from Dulmoth Park.

CAROLINE	Go, go, go.

CALEB	Come on, we need you. Come on Stella, yes.

KENNY	And she’s off.

ISSIE	Come on, come on.

KENNY	And Dulmoth Park have got it back folks.

KENNY	Smash goes the target. Kauri Point have lost valuable time, can they still do it?

KENNY	Oh, it’s a beautiful handover to Bianca Radcliff of Dulmoth Park, and she’s fast folks.

KENNY	But here comes Caroline Burford. Oh, Dulmoth Park smashes it.

ISSIE	Go Caroline.

KENNY	Go Caroline. She’s gaining, it’s neck and neck, go, go, go, go Caroline.

KENNY	Yes. Oh my goodness, that was a buttocks clenching finish.

KENNY	And massive news. Kauri Point, first equal, that’s right Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s a tie, and fastest time goes to Caroline, my daughter, yes.

CALEB	Yes, Caroline.

CAROLINE	Oh my gosh, that was so much fun out there.

DAN	You were flying.

CALEB	That was the best I’ve seen you Stella.

STELLA	Yeah right.

DAN	Seriously, you should be pumped with your performance.

ISSIE	Hey. I just wanted to, I was watching, and, well done.

NATASHA	Gawping at the freak show were you?

ISSIE	I’m really sorry, about, about before, about what I said, about Blaze, about everything. Did you see the Dulmoth Park girl’s face? After the race? She was livid.

CALEB	Yeah, she was so mad. I thought she was gonna lose it.

ISSIE	She was like, ah.

NATASHA	You alright Dan?

DAN	Yeah, I’m just trying to find out where Kayleigh is.

CAROLINE	Hey, are you coming to watch the New Rider?

ISSIE	Um.

STELLA	Yeah, you should come with us.

ISSIE	I’d like to, but, I don’t know.

TOM	Well done you lot. Great teamwork, I’m proud of you. Stella, you had me worried there for a moment.

STELLA	I know.

TOM	But you pulled it back, I was impressed. Nice riding.

STELLA	My family wasn’t there.

TOM	No. But we all were. We saw what you did. It was a great job.

TOM	You really don’t know how to leave, do you?

ISSIE	I’m really sorry Tom.

TOM	I’m sure you are. Listen mate, it’s bad news I’m afraid. Kayleigh’s sick, her mum’s just taken her home.

DAN	Wait, so I don’t have a new rider? What about the assessor, what’s she’s going to assess?

TOM	She could come back at another time, but it won’t be for a couple of months.

DAN	A couple of months?

TOM	Sorry son.

CALEB	Oh, tough one bro.

NATASHA	Yeah, sorry.

ISSIE	Why is this so important?

DAN	Because if I can’t charge for teaching, then I can’t afford the internship.

ISSIE	Aren’t I a new rider? And, aren’t you like my teacher? Technically?

CAROLINE	Ok, what do you think?

ISSIE	Wow. I couldn’t look more ridiculous.

ISSIE	Oh wait, I was wrong. Why is Dan so hung up on this internship thing anyway.

CAROLINE	He’s always been obsessed with being a vet, and it’s at this really cool hospital in Sydney.

STELLA	It’s like, the top place for horses.


CAROLINE	One for the KP Stables website.

ISSIE	Take it and I’ll break it.

KENNY	Let’s have a big hand now for all the new riders coming into the ring. Don’t they look lovely. On their little horses.

KENNY	They look kind of weird don’t they, those horses are really small.

ISSIE	I’m not going in with them, am I?

OFFICIAL	Ah, there’s no jewellery.

ISSIE	I’m not wearing any jewellery.

ISSIE	Oh no, I’m not taking that out.

OFFICIAL	Then you can’t ride.

ISSIE	There you go.

KENNY	And leading the pack is Ruby Williams on Scruffles. Ah, Ruby’s got a birthday on Friday, she’ll be seven years old and she’d like a unicorn cake mum, or dad of course, anyone can bake that cake.

DAN	Alright, keep your heels down.

ISSIE	They are.

DAN	Issie.

ISSIE	Sorry.

KENNY	And hulking over the rest of the pack is a rather mature candidate, Issie Brown.

ISSIE	Oh, kill me, kill me now.

AMANDA	And there’s me thinking my mum dressed as a foam bottle was the biggest surprise of the day.

SAM	Well, you’re a family of surprising women.

KENNY	And giving out the awards now, first prize goes to Ruby Williams, who was always gonna win that one, with a gorgeous jacket like that.

DAN	Issie.

ISSIE	What?

DAN	Take the rosette.

ISSIE	Oh.

DAN	You ok?

ISSIE	Yeah. Did I win something?

DAN	Well they don’t like you little ones to go home empty handed. So.

ISSIE	You know, I could still tell the assessor that you’re rubbish.

DAN	Hey, um, thank you, for everything.

STELLA	Well done Issie, you were amazing.

ISSIE	Stop, stop it.

CALEB	Well it was definitely surreal.

ASSESSOR	Daniel. Congratulations, well done.

DAN	Thank you.

MITCH	Why don’t you climb in the back and lie on it?

ISSIE	Why don’t you climb in the back and lie on it?

MITCH	Because I’m a frail old lady.

ISSIE	Yeah right.

TOM	Mitch. Enjoyed the entertainment.

MITCH	Anytime Tom.

TOM	Where are you going to? You’ve got a horse to look after.

ISSIE	Thank you.

TOM	Da, da, da, da.

ISSIE	Thanks.

ISSIE	Blaze?

ISSIE	I just don’t understand, how did she get out?

CAROLINE	We’ll all look for her.

TOM	Split up, cover more ground.

DAN	Come on. Let’s go.

DAN	Issie? Issie, you ok? You went somewhere.

ISSIE	What do you mean?

DAN	You did it before. What’s going on?

ISSIE	What? Nothing, I, the bridge.

DAN	What about it?

ISSIE	This way, just trust me.

DAN	Ok.

DAN	Which way?

ISSIE	I don’t know.

ISSIE	Um, is there a swing? Like a tyre one?

DAN	Yeah, there’s…

ISSIE	I think it’s red.

DAN	This way.

DAN	It’s just up ahead.

DAN	Ok, so, what are we doing here?

ISSIE	I don’t know.

DAN	Blaze? I’ll text Tom.

ISSIE	Good girl.

DAN	Wait, how did you know she was here?

DAN	Look it wasn’t just a guess. How did you know? And what is going on with you? You’ve been acting really weird. Come on, please. Tell me.

ISSIE	I don’t know how to, cos I don’t know myself. I see things.

DAN	Ok.

ISSIE	Like, visions.

DAN	So, what, you’re psychic?

ISSIE	No. Not really. I have, a see a horse. It’s kind of mystic.

DAN	Mystic?

ISSIE	Yeah. Like, ghostly. You think I’m nuts, don’t you?

DAN	I mean, yeah. But also, no, like it’s not weird to feel connected to animals.

ISSIE	Really?

DAN	Yeah. My nan thinks that the eels down at the creek know when someone in my family is gonna die. But she also thinks I have a beautiful singing voice.

DAN	Look, maybe you should see it as a gift.

ISSIE	A gift?

DAN	Yeah, it’s a good thing. This Mystic horse helps you find Blaze right? Maybe you shouldn’t be afraid of it.

TOM	Good job, how’d you find her?

DAN	Oh, Issie, had a hunch.

TOM	You lead her.

ISSIE	Come on Blaze. What’s going on with her? I don’t get it. What does she want? Does she want me to… do you think she’s ready?

TOM	That’s the first time you’ve asked the right question. Give it a try.

NATASHA	What?

CAROLINE	No way.

ISSIE	You’re home now.
