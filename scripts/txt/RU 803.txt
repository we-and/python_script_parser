RUPAUL	Previously on "RuPaul's Drag Race"…  You'll be competing in the drag-apella movie, "Bitch Perfect."

ALL	(sings) Now sissy that walk.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi Devayne, condragulations, you are the winner of this week's challenge.

RUPAUL	Dax ExclamationPoint, Laila McQueen, neither one of you survived that lip sync.

NAOMI	(mouths word) Shut the f*** up!

RUPAUL	Sashay away.

ACID BETTY	Oh, my god.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Oh!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I did not even see that coming.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Gag of the century.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	You never know what's gonna happen, and when you on the stage, bitch, you better own it.  This is a wakeup call for all of us.  If you ain't stepping that pussy up, your ass is going home.

ROBBIE TURNER	So who do you guys think that RuPaul called?

RUPAUL	I had to eliminate two queens today.  How soon can you get here?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	One queen who needs to be redeemed more than any queen on the "Drag Race" is Victoria "Pork Chop" Parker.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Question is when Shangela returns, what are we gonna do?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I think we should all agree that whoever the girl that comes in, we just ignore her and treat her like poo.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Damn.  We have another bitch coming into the competition?  Girl, this is some bull(bleep).


SINGER	RuPaul's Drag Race…

RUPAUL	The winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race" receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $,.  With extra-special guest judges "Empire's" Tasha Smith and the legendary Faith Evans!

SINGER	RuPaul's drag race.  May the best woman, best woman win.

ACID BETTY	Work.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Work.

ROBBIE TURNER	(laughing) It's a brand-new day!  We've survived.


RUPAUL	Ooh, girl.  She done already done had herses.  To be America's Next Drag Superstar, you don't need to be humble.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Agreed.

RUPAUL	But if you trip or stumble, well, honey, that's just the way that cookie crumbles.  (chuckles)

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

ROBBIE TURNER	Wow!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	This is the outfit.

RUPAUL	Why, thank you.  It is a Klein Epstein & Parker Suit.  They're made to measure.

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Now, ladies, when the supreme court legalized same sex marriage, they moved this country boldly forward.

THORGY THOR	Uh-hmm.

RUPAUL	But when it comes to their sense of style, the justices are, like, so th century.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah.

RUPAUL	Oh, Pit Crew!

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo!  Oh!

RUPAUL	Now for today's mini challenge, I want you to drag up these basic black robes.  Think Judge Judy Couture.  We'll take a -minute recess, and then, the Supreme Court Fashion Show will be in session.  Go!

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Ah!

THORGY THOR	Think this looks like absolute garbage, and I love it.

RUPAUL	Ladies!  Time's up.  Category is, Supreme Court Realness.

RUPAUL	First up, Bob The Drag Queen.  She received her law degree online from the Tyler Perry "I Can Learn Law All By Myself" School.  Supreme Court Justice Naomi Smalls from the Law Firm of Evangelista and Fangs.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughing)

RUPAUL	She almost got disbarred for excessive mouth pops.

NAOMI SMALLS	(pops)

RUPAUL	That was only one.

NAOMI SMALLS	(popping)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN & RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Justice Derrick Barry.  She was inspired to study law after sneaking into a matinee of "Legally Blonde."  Oh!

DERRICK BARRY	Oh, and then my wig come off.

RUPAUL	(laughs) All rise for Supreme Court Justice Cynthia Lee Fontaine, aka Cuckoo Freedom.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

RUPAUL	She made herstory with her landmark verdict for legalizing sex.

RUPAUL	Really, judge?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughing)

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I think it was funny.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Supreme Court Justice Acid Betty.  She believes in every citizen's right to go fisting.

RUPAUL		Uh, it said--I'm sorry, it's go fishing.

RUPAUL	Supreme Court Justice Robbie Turner.  If Justice Turner had her way, she'd outlaw ex-boyfriend Donald Trump.
BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

RUPAUL	All rise for Supreme Court Justice Kim Chi.  She got her start at the Law Firm of Ching Chang & Chong.  I did not write these.

RUPAUL	Do not send me letters.  Supreme Court Justice Thorgy Thor.

RUPAUL	She made herstory legalizing the right to stop traffic and tap-dance.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughing)

RUPAUL	All rise for Supreme Court Justice Chi Chi Devayne.  She made herstory with her landmark verdict legalizing ass clapping.
DERRICK BARRY	Wha!

RUPAUL	Yes, your honor, yes.  If justice is blind, that bitch is missing out.

RUPAUL	The winner is…


RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Nice!

THORGY THOR	Ooh!

RUPAUL	And I'll be posting all of these supreme looks at logotv.com.  Ladies, last week, several eliminations left a void that I've decided to fill with the one and only…

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Bitches, I'm back!

ALL	(screaming)

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Oh, my god, it's Naysha!  She's back on the competition.

ROBBIE TURNER	Naysha should have walked in with her luggage and just kept on walking.  Bye, girl.

RUPAUL	Naysha, you're getting a second chance.  So don't (bleep) it up.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Okay.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	Now, for this week's maxi challenge, you'll be overacting in a pilot for my new TV series, "Ruco's Empire."  #DragEmpire

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	That's right, RuRu Kitty girls.  It's cookie time.

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls, you won the mini challenge.  So you're a team captain.  And Naysha Lopez, as a welcome back gift, you're team captain too.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	I'm not trying to (bleep) my second chance, so let's do this.

RUPAUL	Naomi, you get first pick.

NAOMI SMALLS	I choose Robbie Turner.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	All right.

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Naysha.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Derrick Barry.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yay!

NAOMI SMALLS	Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoo!

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Thorgy.

THORGY THOR	Yes!

DERRICK BARRY	Awesome.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Whoo!

NAOMI SMALLS	Chi chi.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Whoo.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Kim Chi.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah!

RUPAUL	Well, that leaves Acid Betty and "Santee Alley" Fontaine.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm gonna go with "Santee Alley."

NAYSHA LOPEZ	All right.

RUPAUL	Which means Acid Betty, you are on Naysha's team.

ACID BETTY	(bleep).  Just kidding.

RUPAUL	Gentlemen, start your engines.  And may the smartest cookie win.  (claps hands)

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Okay, so let's go through all of them real quick.  "Ginger snap, classic militant activist." she's intense, so you want to take that role?

DERRICK BARRY	Uh…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick's playing this militant lesbian.  Really?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	"Chocolate Chip Cookie, the over-the-top super diva.  She's got major attitude and blingy style."

KIM CHI	I will feel comfortable with chocolate chip cookie, personally.

ACID BETTY	There's a lot of words in this.  Did you look at the script?

KIM CHI	(high pitched) That's right, Chocolate Chip Cookie's back!

ACID BETTY	I did not understand at all what you said.

KIM CHI	(high pitched) And this gonna be my chance to win back Rucious for good!

ACID BETTY	(high pitched) Why are you talking up here like that?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Think the other team should be worried because they have a lot of girls that are just like…not black.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

RUPAUL & FAITH	Action.

THORGY THOR	I'm here to get what's mine.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Bitch!  You couldn't even make bail.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I'm a strong gay woman!

RUPAUL	Okay.  (laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)


THORGY THOR	Boom!  (grunting)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	"You double-crossing bitches."  For today's challenge, we have to perform in scenes inspired by the show, "Empire."  It's got drama.  It's got Cookie.  I mean, this is a dream come true.  "Maybe it was a lil' somethin'-somethin' extra I put in the drink."  (laughs)

NAOMI SMALLS	I've never seen "Empire," but Cookie sounds like a handful.  And Bob is a (bleep) handful, so it's just a match made in heaven.

ROBBIE TURNER	One thing I would say, make it, like a "or maybe…"

NAOMI SMALLS	Let's do it again.

ROBBIE TURNER	'Cause it got lost.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yeah, yeah.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Robbie, she's a trained actress and she's giving us all these tips.

ROBBIE TURNER	Like, this whole thing, and then be like, "Stand back, bitches!"

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	We're definitely gonna win this challenge.

KIM CHI	"What you want?  Oh, hello, Rucious's doctor."  It's Rucious's doctor.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	This is one stale-ass Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Just an observation that I'm just making, Thorgy and Kim Chi switch.

THORGY THOR	I would love to.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yeah, super diva.

THORGY THOR	This is gonna be so good.  I really want to do this.  "Oh, you better think again, RuRu Kitty.  That's right; Chocolate Chip Cookie is back."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	"Did I hear my name?"

DERRICK BARRY	It sounded like Bob was doing…

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Of course.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah.

THORGY THOR	We're gonna be up against each other.  What part did you pick, Bob?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Chocolate Chip Cookie.

THORGY THOR	Of course both myself and Bob are playing Chocolate Chip Cookie parts, and we're gonna be compared.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Rivalry.  Thorgy's hilarious, but I'm like, "I am not worried about that."  "Well, where the hell is Rucious?  Rucious!"

THORGY THOR	There's a fire under my ass.  And I really, really (bleep) want to win the challenge.

RUPAUL	All right.  Team Naysha.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	It's time to shoot the scene, and everyone's feeling a little nervous.

RUPAUL	Welcome to our beautiful set, furnished by our friends at Rrivre Works.

RUPAUL	And say hello to my co-director.  Grammy Award-winning First Lady of Hip-hop, Faith Evans is here

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Hey.

FAITH	Hi, ladies.

DERRICK BARRY	What's up?  Mm-hmm.

RUPAUL	All right, places, people…(claps hands) places.

THORGY THOR	Whoo.

RUPAUL	It takes a village, people.

THORGY THOR	Jesus, be my savior.

RUPAUL	Here we go, and…

RUPAUL & FAITH	Action.

THORGY THOR	I'm here to get what's mine.

ACID BETTY	No, you're not.  (in deep voice) Yes, she is.  Who are you?  (in deep voice) Stop interrupting me.

RUPAUL	(chuckles)

KIM CHI	You all need to chill.  The big Ruco White Party is coming up.

RUPAUL	And cut.  Kim Chi, I need to see more of this.  I need to see this.

FAITH	We smack a lot when we ratchet.  (smacking lips)

KIM CHI	All tight.
FAITH	Girl.
RUPAUL	Mm-hmm.

KIM CHI	(no sound smack)

RUPAUL	Like this.

RUPAUL	Um…yeah.  Let's try that again.

KIM CHI	Listen, ho ho!  (clicks tongue)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

KIM CHI	Chocolate Chip Cookie's supposed to be in jail!  (clicks tongue)

FAITH	That was much better.  And action.

THORGY THOR	I'm gonna make you a star.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Bitch, you couldn't even make bail.

THORGY THOR	Ooh…

RUPAUL	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	But I can whoop yo ass.

THORGY THOR & NAYSHA LOPEZ	(grunting)

TEAM NAYSHA	(gasp)

FAITH	(laughing)

THORGY THOR & NAYSHA LOPEZ	(grunting)

THORGY THOR	Nobody wants a bitch who gets kicked off to come back, so I was glad to beat the (bleep) out of her with this dirty broom.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

DERRICK BARRY	The white party is the time for me to tell the whole world, it's okay to be gay.

RUPAUL	Cut.  Derrick, I'm losing you in that moment.  I know--you're not sort of connecting with anyone.  Just make sure that you command the room.

DERRICK BARRY	Okay.  The white party is the time for me to tell the whole world, that it's okay…(cries) it's okay to be gay.

ACID BETTY	What the hell is Derrick doing?  She's lost in an afro.  She's not funny.  Come on, Britney.  Step it up.

RUPAUL	Team Naomi.  My co-director, Faith Evans is here.

FAITH	Hi, ladies.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	This notorious B.I.G.'s wife.

NAOMI SMALLS	I got my drag name from Biggie Smalls, so I'm (bleep) freaking out.

RUPAUL	Now, she has lived this life, so if you have any questions for her in terms of character or inspiration…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	What's the best hand to slap a hoe with, like, the left or the right?

FAITH	Well, I'm left-handed.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, yeah.

RUPAUL	All right, so places, people, places.

FAITH	Action.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Now where the hell is Rucious?  Rucious!

NAOMI SMALLS	Rucious probably smelled you and went runnin'.

FAITH	(chuckles)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, then why did I waste my time puttin' on this.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Why you all gaggin'?  I bring it to you every episode.

FAITH	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(claps hands) Cut.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You say this is an over-acting challenge, I'm like, (puffs).  You ain't gotta tell me twice.

FAITH	Action.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(rapping) Yo, yo, yo, hallelu, hallelu.  My name's Shortbread, that's my girl, Macaroon.
RUPAUL & FAITH	(laughing)

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	And that's why they need a strong woman on this company.

RUPAUL	Cut.  Miss Cynthia Lee, you just left out the word "Gay," when you said, "This company needs a…"

RUPAUL & CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	"Strong, gay woman."

RUPAUL	Yes, because that's--that's the joke.  Okay, let's try that again.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	This company need a gay, strong woman.

RUPAUL	Wait, cut.  The line is, "A strong, gay woman!"

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I'm a strong, gay woman!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Cynthia's Ginger Snap is hilarious for all the wrong reasons.  I don't even know if she knows what she's saying.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	(whistles)

RUPAUL	All right.  Let's move on.

ROBBIE TURNER	That and how to shoplift.  Empty your pockets, please, ma'am.  (bleep), line.

RUPAUL	Robbie, differentiate those voices, so that we know it's two different people.

ROBBIE TURNER	Do want it, like, satanic or something?

FAITH	(clears throat)	

RUPAUL	Just make them different.

ROBBIE TURNER	Okay.  That and how to shoplift.  (high pitched) Please, sir, empty your…(babbling) please ma'am, will you empty your pocketbook?  (normal voice) Ah!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Robbie is really screwing it up.  You're the one I was most confident in.

RUPAUL	We're gonna have to work with what we have.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	We could end up losing this because of Robbie's mistakes.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	The girls are gonna do a runway in roller skates.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I've never skated before.

ACID BETTY	Really?  This is a mess I can't wait to see.

TASHA	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

RUPAUL	Whoa, whoa.

TASHA	(shrieks)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

ALL	(screaming happily)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	For the first time in Drag herstory, the girls are gonna do a runway in roller skates.

ACID BETTY	So anybody nervous about skating?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I've never skated before.

ACID BETTY	Really?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Ever.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	So since I can't skate, I have this idea, like, maybe I can, like, turn into a car to, like, mask it.

ACID BETTY	Do you have, like, wheels for your arms and stuff?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, I have to make my wheels, so.
ACID BETTY	You have to make wheels.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah.

ACID BETTY	So he plans on falling and what, crawling across the stage like a transformer?  This is a mess I can't wait to see.

THORGY THOR	How you feelin', Robbie?

ROBBIE TURNER	I feel…actually…better.

ROBBIE TURNER	Girl, I'm the Disco Rockin' Diva of the roller rink.  And my hope is that my runway look redeems me from that horrible performance in the acting challenge.  I'm actually wearing my mom's vintage sunglasses, which I'm really excited about.

THORGY THOR	My parents were straight-up hippies.

ROBBIE TURNER	I would love, love to meet your parents.

THORGY THOR	My mom, uh, passed away when I was .

ROBBIE TURNER	What happened?

THORGY THOR	She had cancer.  I was in college, like, having a blast, and, like, I would always call and be like, "How's everything?"  It was always fine.  But it wasn't.  And I finally got a call from my dad being like, "You know, you should probably really come home."  When I went home, I mean, she was not the--she was not a person.  She…she wasn't there.  I wish they were just a little bit more honest with me, 'cause when I got home, she died that day.

ROBBIE TURNER	Oh, my god.

THORGY THOR	She was a skeleton in a hospital bed.  I didn't really get a good-bye.  And I kinda feel like that was taken from me.  And I'm very angry about it, but I don't know where to put that anger.  It comes out of love for my dad, he's like, "I just don't want to, like, interrupt your life and ruin--like, I want better things for you."  And I'm like, I get that…

ROBBIE TURNER	"And my parents wanted to protect me."  Yeah.

THORGY THOR	But things like that, like…I didn't get to say good-bye to her.  She didn't want to make my dad and my sister feel, like, terrible, but…how come they didn't, like, tell me to come home?  I will never forget that day.  I guess that's why I talk about things so much.

ROBBIE TURNER	Just get it over with.  That's a great idea.

THORGY THOR	(laughs)

ROBBIE TURNER	Keep doing that.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

SINGER	Cover girl.…

MICHELLE	Yeah!

SINGER	Put the bass in your walk.  Head to toe…

SINGER	Let your whole body talk.  And what?

RUPAUL	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Yeah!

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "RuPaul's Drag Race."  Michelle Visage, thanks for helping me build my empire.  How was prison?

ICHELLE & RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Fashion superstar Carson Kressley, what's your favorite cookie?

CARSON	I like those Samoans.

MICHELLE	It's a Samoa.

CARSON	Oh, is it a Samoa?

MICHELLE	Samoan is the person.

RUPAUL	From the hit shows, "Empire" and "Power," my acting class pal, Tasha Smith is here.

TASHA	Hey, baby!

RUPAUL	(laughs)

TASHA	Hey!

RUPAUL	And the legendary Faith Evans.

FAITH	Hey, Ru.

RUPAUL	Were you mesmerized by my girls?

FAITH	Oh, my, was I.

RUPAUL	(laughs) This week, we challenged our queens to act up a storm in "Ruco's Empire."  Tonight, for the first time in Drag Race FirStory, category is Roller Girl Realness.  Gentlemen, start your roller skates.  And may the best woman win!
SINGER	The realness…

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez.

MICHELLE	Oh, my gosh, you're giving us Tamar Braxton.

FAITH	And Adrienne Bailon.

MICHELLE	Mm-hmm.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	I'm giving you "Xanadu" realness, boo.  Next thing you know, I fall.  Oh, my god, if they show me falling as my runway, I'm gonna be furious.

MICHELLE	That booty is cute, boo.

RUPAUL	Booty wonderland.

FAITH	Bootilicious.

RUPAUL & CARSON	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Thorgy Thor.

TASHA	She's giving very "Three's Company."

CARSON	Come and knock on her door.

TASHA	(laughs)

THORGY THOR	I'm super comfortable in these roller skates.  This is one of the first looks I ever did, like, this is classic Thorgy.

RUPAUL	Hey, good-lookin'.  Be back to pick you up later.

MICHELLE	Call me on the party line.  Is this a three-way?

CARSON	(giggles)

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.  Very Skaty Perry.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

DERRICK BARRY	I love my outfit.  I feel like I'm giving them pop princess peach.  It's different from anything that I've worn before.

FAITH	Oh!

RUPAUL	That's a bubble butt if I ever seen one.  Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	Toucan!

RUPAUL	Look at the size of that cockatoo.

KIM CHI	The entire ensemble is inspired by John Galliano.  It's a contrast between nude and all the colors that are in a parrot.

RUPAUL	Yes, honey, you better sissy that macaw.  Acid Betty.  "Beyond Thunderdome."


ACID BETTY	Punk unicorn realness.  I am a bitch on wheels times ten.  I'm reliving my childhood in the 's, honey.  Don't turn your back on me.

MICHELLE	Mad maxi pad.

CARSON	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls.

TASHA	Classic beauty.

RUPAUL	She is like a flamingo.

MICHELLE	Yes.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm wearing a pretty in pink bedroom scene.  My outfit is so not roller girl, but I'm pulling it off.

RUPAUL	Michelle, what's the hardest part of roller skating?

MICHELLE	Mm.

RUPAUL	Telling your mother that you're gay.

RUPAUL	See you later, roller skater.  Bob The Drag Queen.  Not to be confused with Bob The High School Counselor.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I didn't have enough time to finish this Transformer outfit, so I do my backup plan.  I'm like "Tron," robot-inspired character.

RUPAUL	She's a ro--oh, yes girl.

MICHELLE	Uh-oh.  Be careful.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	And I'm just like, try to move offstage without breaking a limb.

CARSON	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

TASHA	Whoa, whoa.  (shrieks)

RUPAUL	Nice save.  (claps hands) She's like a rumba!

FAITH	Don't go too fast now.

MICHELLE	Okay.  Slow down girl.

FAITH	Don't go too fast.

TASHA	(shrieks)

FAITH	Oh, work it!

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

CARSON	She's a little bit country.

RUPAUL	It's Barbara Mandrell on wheels.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I love my runway look.  It's like Farrah Fawcett meets with Olivia Newton John in Texas.  I feel like the goddesses of roller blades.

CARSON	If she falls, there will be a hoe down.

MICHELLE	There will be.

FAITH	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Chi Chi Devayne from Louisiana.  Yeah, this had a roller street part.

MICHELLE	That's it.

CARSON	Yes!

MICHELLE	She got tricks.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm a disco queen, honey.  Funky, tight roller girl.  This is me.

CARSON	She's got that hair snatched back in a afro puff.  Yeah.

RUPAUL	Ooh, a little backwards skating.

CARSON	Yeah, back rolls.

MICHELLE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Up next, Robbie Turner.  Oh, Lord!

TASHA	All right!

MICHELLE	Uh-oh!

ROBBIE TURNER	I am roller girl realness personified.  It's got my initials on my ass and a little star booty.  And I'm wearing my aunt Diana's hair.  I scalped her in, like, .

RUPAUL	It's like a Rhinestone roller girl.

CARSON	Yes.

RUPAUL	Mmm.  Coming up…

TASHA	Taraji is going to die.  Lee Daniels is going to die.

THORGY THOR	Yes!  (laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

MICHELLE	(laughing)

MAN	(on TV) Will it be my beautiful Halle Berry wannabe girlfriend, Vanilla Wafer?  (coughs) My brilliant daughter with multiple degrees and multiple personalities, Macaroon?  My overly sensitive daughter, who thinks she's sittin' on a secret, Ginger Snap?  My hood rat baby girl, Shortbread?  Or will it all go to my sassy ex-wife, Chocolate Chip Cookie?  (coughs violently)

KIM CHI	What?  (clicks tongue) But Chocolate Chip Cookie's supposed to be in jail!  (clicks tongue)

THORGY THOR	Ooh!  You better think again, RuRu Kitty.  That's right.  Chocolate Chip Cookie's back!  Get off of me.  And I'm here to take what's mine, now get this orange (bleep) off my body.

KIM CHI	Ex-squeeze me?

THORGY THOR	My baby's got talent.  (grunts)

RUPAUL AND MICHELLE	(laugh)

THORGY THOR	And that's for not visiting me in prison, bitch.

DERRICK BARRY	Stop!  It's time I get something off my chest.  (sings) This is my day I was born this way, and my biggest secret is I'm proud to be…

TEAM NAYSHA	Gay.  We know.

THORGY THOR	But damn, my little baby's got a voice.

DERRICK BARRY	Yeah.

THORGY THOR	I'm gonna make you a star.

RUPAUL	(chuckles)

THORGY THOR	No…but I can whoop yo ass with this!

NAYSHA LOPEZ	(gasps)

NAYSHA LOPEZ & THORGY THOR	(grunting)

RUPAUL	Next up, team Naomi.

NAOMI SMALLS	Girls, at this damn White Party, we're gonna act like a family.


BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs) I know y'all ain't starting this White-ass Party without me.  And why it gotta be white, you know?  (laughs) Uh, where's Rucious?  Rucious!

NAOMI SMALLS	Rucious probably smelled you and went runnin'.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, well, then why did I waste my time.  Putting on this?  Oh, there's more.  This!  Why'd I waste my time doin' that, bitch?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	'Cause you the crazy ass hoe.  (chuckles)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Where'd you learn to talk like that?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I learned it from you, bitch.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	That's about the only thing you taught us.

ROBBIE TURNER	Yeah, that, and how to shoplift.  Empty your pockets, please, ma'am.  (high pitched) I didn't do it!  Mama told me to!

NAOMI SMALLS	Well, well.  This is nice, but let's have a drink.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(stammering and shrieking) In this house, before we drink, we say grace.  Now can I get a "Amen, hallelu"?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(rapping) Yo, yo, yo, hallelu, hallelu my name's Shortbread, that's my girl, Macaroon.  Eat these cookie now whatcha want do and drink this milk, bitch you know you want to.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	All right, I knew you had it, baby!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yes!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I knew you had it.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Stop oppressing me!  (sings) I am sickening, I am gorgeous, I'm a strong, gay woman!

TEAM NAOMI	Bitch, we're all gay.

ROBBIE TURNER	I'm not gay.  (in a deep voice) Yes, you are.  (normal voice) That one time in college doesn't count.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	My baby.  (grunts)

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Jeez!

RUPAUL	Oh!  (laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Girl, you better step your medications up.

NAOMI SMALLS	Wow, you really all are crazy.  That's why I'm secretly plotting to go work for our rival company, Lady Bunny Death Hoe Records.

TEAM NAOMI	(gasp)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You fake-ass, Dominique Deveraux wannabe!  (screams)

ROBBIE TURNER	Oh, my god.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Take it, bitch.  Expensive vodka.

NAOMI SMALLS	Stand back, bitches.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Bring it, bitch.  (stammering and shouting)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You lucky my pre-paid phone ringin'.  I woulda whooped your little skinny ass.  Who dis?  It's Rucious' doctor, y'all.  Hello, Rucious's doctor.  What, what?  Rucious is…severely deadly illnesses is…contagious?

TEAM NAOMI	(screaming)

NAOMI SMALLS	Oh!

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Is because I'm gay?  Isn't it?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Peace.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh…I guess whatever Rucious had, it really was sickening.  (laughs) Or maybe it was a lil' extra somethin-somethin I put in the cocktails.  (maniacal laugh) Oh, you thirsty, bitch?  (laughs) Whoo!  I'ma take this (bleep).  Gimme the shoe, bitch.  (laughs) Oh!  Look at all this money.  He ain't got no (bleep) backup.  Is the train still runnin'?

RUPAUL	Wow.  Well, there you have it, ladies.  And all based on actual events.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Ladies, this week you acted in teams.  But tonight, you'll be judged individually.

RUPAUL	Coming up…

CARSON	I don't know what you were saying, but I didn't care.

FAITH	I think you were very convincing as a schizo.

MICHELLE	Show me that you do have soul.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Ladies, when I call your names, please roll forward.  Naomi Smalls.  Kim Chi.  Naysha Lopez.  Chi Chi Devayne.  Ladies, you are safe.  You may leave the stage.

RUPAUL	The rest of you represent the high rollers and the low rollers of the week.  Now it's time for the judges' critiques.  Starting with Thorgy Thor.

CARSON	Your roller girl look--you're giving me 's.  You had the big blonde 'fro.  Not the most wildly inventive.

THORGY THOR	Okay.

MICHELLE	Now I'm gonna go to your performance, which was so good.  Your delivery, your choreography was meticulously done.

THORGY THOR	Yes!  (laughs)

MICHELLE	I'm so proud of you.  Great job.

RUPAUL	Next up, Derrick Barry.

CARSON	I like this whole, like, Jeremy Scott for Katy Perry kind of thing.

MICHELLE	You are doing a great job with trying to give us something other than Brittney.  But I feel like you're coming out and these clothes are wearing you.
FAITH	With your performance, the personality of the character didn't really connect.  It was too laid back.

MICHELLE	I'd love to see you show me that you do have soul.  So what you need to get to work on is giving us your soul.  (chuckles)
RUPAUL	Thank you very much.  Next up, Acid Betty.

TASHA	Your performance, I felt like you gave me the "Sybil" multiple personality with a little bit of Carol Burnett goin' on.

FAITH	I think you were very convincing as a schizo.

ACID BETTY	(chuckles)

MICHELLE	This look tonight, it's getting kinda predictable.  I'd love to see something way different.

ACID BETTY	Another challenge, Michelle.

MICHELLE	I (bleep) love challenges.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

CARSON	Be you but don't be you.  Give us less but more.

RUPAUL	All right, next up, Bob The Drag Queen.

CARSON	I love this look.  You did this Glamazon girl from "Tron."

TASHA	Tin man, I have to say, needs some lubricant.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

MICHELLE	Now let's get to the performance.  Everything about it was on point.  That adlibs were really, really good.

TASHA	Taraji is going to die.  Lee Daniels is going to die.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(chuckles)

RUPAUL	Next up, Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

MICHELLE	Cynthia.  You have a great body with a shirt that's like a formal with a formal necklace and formal earrings, then you have, like, hooters shorts that don't fit at all.  It's so discombobulated.
CARSON	The "Empire" scene, I don't know what you were saying, but I didn't care.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

RUPAUL	There were some nuances that were missed.  What did you think, watching yourself in the scene?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I love it.

CARSON & FAITH	(laughs)

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	It was really good.  It was really good.

RUPAUL	Thank you very much.  All right, next, Robbie Turner.

MICHELLE	I do love the jumpsuit.  But what's bothering me is all the silver accoutrements and then a gold necklace.  I would lose the necklace.

FAITH	Um, when we were workin' on that scene, Ru was directing you to kinda get into the two different voices.  I don't think you stuck with that.
ROBBIE TURNER	It was kinda like I didn't have a moment to, like, break and think of your notes before we moved on to another note and also remember where the blocking for the camera was because I can't see very far.  When we originally read it, I was Vanilla Wafer.  And it--we did change it.

MICHELLE	Did that hurt you, you think?

ROBBIE TURNER	I think it did hurt me, and I didn't speak up even though I was feeling it, and so for the betterment of the team, I was like…

TASHA	You can't allow yourself to be a victim and use the excuse of, "I was being nice."  It's a competition.

RUPAUL	Well, thank you, ladies.  I think we've heard enough.  While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.

RUPAUL	All right, now just between us squirrel friends, what do you think?  Thorgy Thor.

TASHA	Her Chocolate Chip Cookie killed it.

RUPAUL	It's safe to say that, uh, her Chocolate Chip Cookie was baked in a lovin' oven.

TASHA & MICHELLE	Mm-hmm.

CARSON	It brings all the boys to the yard.

RUPAUL	Yeah!  (laughs)

FAITH	That's the milkshake.

CARSON	Oh.

RUPAUL	Yes.

TASHA	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

MICHELLE	She goes from Britney spears to Katy Perry.  I'm still waiting to find Derrick Barry.

FAITH	I thought the runway was really cute.

MICHELLE	But in the scene, Ginger Snap got lost to me.

RUPAUL	I've seen her perform as Britney Spears.  She puts her whole self into it, and that's what she needed to do in this challenge.  Acid Betty.
CARSON	I think she did look like a roller warrior, but I could probably do without the mohawk.

MICHELLE	In this role, she looks like she's one french fry short of a happy meal straight away.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

TASHA	It's not easy to improv, but also stay focused on the scene.  I am feelin' her swag.

CARSON	She has charisma and it allows her to sell absolutely anything.

MICHELLE	This "Tron" jumpsuit is so basic, and I found myself goin', "Oh, my god, I love it so much."

MICHELLE	This is great.

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

CARSON	Bless her cotton socks with that runway outfit.

RUPAUL	Oh!  Oh!

MICHELLE	They were fruit of the loom.

TASHA	I just felt like she didn't commit to the role that she had, as sweet as she is, but what's sweet got to do with it?

RUPAUL	All right, Ike Turner.

MICHELLE	Okay.

RUPAUL	Yes.  Robbie Turner.

TASHA	You had given a lot of direction, but Robbie did not really get it.

MICHELLE	But I love that jumpsuit.  I would wear the hell out of that jumpsuit.  I love it.

RUPAUL	(claps hands) Silence!  I've made my decision.  Bring back my roller girls.  (laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Welcome back, ladies.  I've made some decisions.  Thorgy Thor.  You're safe.  Bob The Drag Queen.  Condragulations, you're the winner of this week's challenge.

ROBBIE TURNER	Whoo!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you!

RUPAUL	You've won $, of innovative eyewear from Bradley Kenneth.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, wow!  Ah!  Now all the other girls can see what I can do.  I feel like everyone knows I'm a girl to beat.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty.  You're safe.

ACID BETTY	Thank you, mama.

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee Fontaine, your Ginger Snap was loca, but the judges were not crazy about your roller girl.  I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turner, your Macaroon was not coconut-y enough.  Derrick Barry, your Ginger Snap did not snap, crackle, or pop.  Robbie Turner, I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.  Derrick Barry, you are safe, but…you better work, bitch.

DERRICK BARRY	(chuckles) (sniffles)

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee, Robbie, now it's your choice.  Do you want to lip sync in heels or wheels?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Heels.

ROBBIE TURNER	Wheels.

ACID BETTY	Ooh.

RUPAUL	Two queens stand before me.  Prior to tonight, you are asked to prepare a lip sync performance of "Mesmerized" by Faith Evans.  Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination.

RUPAUL	The time has come…

RUPAUL	For you to lip sync…for your life.  (echoes)

ROBBIE TURNER	I deserve to be here.  I'm not going.

RUPAUL	Good luck and don't (bleep) it up.

SINGER	(talks) You ever heard about that thing?  I mean that real thing?  (sings) You don't know what you do to me, do to me.  Let me tell you how ya make me feel my heart is on fire since you put that thang on me, oh, oh.  You put that thang on me, baby.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I'm the star right now.  Everybody is mesmerized about my cuckoo and my dance.

SINGER	You got me so caught up baby, I'm spellbound.  I'm floating on cloud nine I can't even sleep, boy, you got me weak.  My heart is on fire since you put that thang on me.

ROBBIE TURNER	Am I the first girl that's ever broken a light on the runway?  I'm gonna say yes.

SINGER	You don't know what you do to me, do to me.  Let me tell you how ya make me feel.  I can't even sleep boy, you got me weak.  My heart is on fire since you put that thang on me.
ALL	(scream)

CARSON	Yeah!

RUPAUL	Ladies, I've made my decision.

RUPAUL	Robbie turner…shantay, you stay.

ROBBIE TURNER	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee Fontaine, Puerto Rico, Austin, Santee Alley, and now the world.  Keep spreading your cuckoo.  Now, sashay away.
CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I love you.  Thank you.  Thank you.


ROBBIE TURNER	Whoo!

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Thank you.

THORGY THOR	Love you.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	See you soon, mis amores!  I feel sad, but, at the same time, I don't have any regrets.  I would like to encourage everybody, don't stop believing.  Even if you are the only one that believes in yourself.  (speaks Spanish) This is Cynthia Lee Fontaine, #misamorescuckoo.

RUPAUL	Condragulations, my queens.  Now remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?  Can I get a Amen up here?

ALL	Amen!

RUPAUL	All right, now let the music play.

SINGER	Dance for life, die tomorrow, live tonight, die tomorrow, live tonight, die tomorrow, live tonight.
