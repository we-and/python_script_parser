("#HEGOTITALLMIXEDUP (DYSLEXIA)")

(Episode #106)




MARS	Yo, what up Martians, everybody else. Yo, I'ma take you onto this room real quick and I'ma show you guys some shit that's a little bit deep. Yo, hurry up though. Alright, hurry up. 'Cause I'm trying to keep my crazy ass sister out this room. Fort Greene Projects lock, keep the crazy motherfuckers out. Here's my safe, I'm “disliptic”. Shit keeps slipping, so I keep it open. Alright. Y'all ready for this? Real quick, my dad died when I was a kid and one of the best moments I ever had with him I'm about to share with you, right now. Boom, baby! April Eighteenth (18th), Nineteen-Ninety- Seven (1997). Madison Square Garden. New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls. Yo, my dad took me to see the orange and blue skies, my New York Knicks versus my main man Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. Me and my dad waited all night, yo at least two hours outside, for M.J. And he came out and signed his Thirteens (13s). Game on 13s. What?! My man had them hanging off his shoulders. My dad told me, I didn't remember too well but my Paps was like : “Yo, you asked him for them kicks.” Well if there's any confirmation he's the greatest dude on earth, is that right there. That was one of the best nights in my life and that was one of the best moments I ever had with my late father. I love you Paps. But it's getting a little deep up in here, so you ain't got to go home, but you got to get the fuck up out of of here, alright? I got places to go, I got people to see, I'm, like, making moves so... Love you, see you later. Sayonara, thanks for coming, love you Martians, and may O to the S out. Busted your Ass putting up some strong Ass Political Artwork and then some bitch ass Onyx come behind you trying to Piggy Back of your hard work? Get the fuck out of here. I tell you this, Martians. Fall Back on your Back and Back on your fall. ‘Cause that's the first thing you got to get back up from. Dyslexia got a Brother Bouncing but I ain’t Tripping. Dyslexia is my Super Power. So there’s a Damsel in Distress 'cause I got to de-stress my Damsel. Do you know, do you know, do you know?

CLORINDA	What’s taking so long?

NOLA	They’ll be here any minute.

CLORINDA	You’re cutting it to close. But don’t panic.

NOLA	Nobody's panicking.
 
CLORINDA	Even if it was suppose to be set up days ago.

NOLA	Clo, I told you, it wasn’t ready yet.

MARS	Hey lady! You the one that ordered this freak show?

NOLA	Okay, now I’m panicking.

CLORINDA	What is it Nola?

NOLA	Uh, I'll be there in a minute, okay? What the Hell is this? I thought you said you got a Cargo Van.

NOLA	I get it. I’ll text you the address, okay? I'm gonna catch a cab.

CASH	You want that paper? You want that Bugatti lease? You better shake that funky...

NOLA	Fucking “she Assed for it” commercials everywhere. How do they get air time? Yes!
 
CAB DRIVER	I see you on that show. She Assed for it. You weren't first winner?

NOLA	No, Sir, I was not the fucking first winner.

CAB DRIVER	Ah, why you cuss? I no cuss at you.

SHEMEKKA	Yo.

NOLA	What's going on with stuff?

SHEMEKKA	Very good. Tonight’s my Night.

NOLA	Your Night?

SHEMEKKA	Yeah, my Show’s tonight. You know, my show? I'm making my debut tonight. You don’t remember?

NOLA	No! Hold the fuck up. Your Debut's tonight and you didn’t tell me?

SHEMEKKA	Yeah whatever, I told you I got a show last week. So what's up, you coming through?

NOLA	No, no I mean I can't. My, my Show's tonight, too. Damn, I guess that means you ain't coming. I really kind of wanted you there like, I’m light weight nervous about it. When did you book your Show? I know I told you this gallery opening's tonight.
 
CAB DRIVER	Pretty lips. You have pretty lips.

NOLA	This motherfucker's crazy. Okay, Sir, I'm sorry, I will report you.

CAB DRIVER	No, no please.

NOLA	Like I will report you.

CAB DRIVER	No please don't deport me.

NOLA	No, report. Not deport.

CAB DRIVER	Please don't deport me.

NOLA	Sir, why are we stopping?

SHEMEKKA	Congratulations, Nola. Always about you.

NOLA	No, it's not all about me. That’s why I’m calling you... This fucking traffic though.

CAB DRIVER	Oh, why you cuss?

NOLA	Body contouring is good then?

SHEMEKKA	Yeah, I’m standing on the corner of Central Park South right now, about to walk into the Doctor’s office.
 
NOLA	Why, what happened?

SHEMEKKA	Nothing happened. Why something always gotta be happening? Getting a little top off for tonight. Wow, I thought you was calling to say Good Luck and shit with my Debut tonight.

NOLA	You don't even need to be on this street. We're just going to Dumbo? Quickest way, quickest way.

SHEMEKKA	Well nah, it’s Cool that you ain't coming through tonight. I just don’t want you judging me and shit 'cause that’s something Clorinda would do.

NOLA	Whatever makes you Happy.

SHEMEKKA	I am. I'm very happy. And I ain't have to rely on three niggas to make that shit happen.

NOLA	I gotta go.

CAB DRIVER	Pretty lips.

NOLA	Yeah I... I gotta go.

MARS	Daaamn! This Shit is Futuristical!
 
CLORINDA	Where is Nola?

MARS	How are you?

CLORINDA	Fine.

MARS	I didn't come here to start a Fight. I just came here for my Girl, Nola.

CLORINDA	You know what, I don't need to know all that. What I do need to know though is why is there a big ass Chinese Take Out Box in here?

MARS	I got Nola’s Art, yo. She’s behind me in a Cab.

CLORINDA	I hope it didn't get damaged.

MARS	I wouldn’t do my girls dirty like that.

CLORINDA	Yeah, you say that now.

MARS	Damn, you acting like you got Two Heads on your Shoulder and one of them is named Chip.

CLORINDA	Haha, you too fucking funny, I’ll give you that. How’s that working out for you? You still living at your Sister's in the Fort Greene Projects?
 
MARS	Let’s not beat around the Bush, alright? Let’s get to it and shove it in.

CLORINDA	Ewww. You are so uncouth.

MARS	Don’t be trying to throw fancy words at me. You taking shots at my Dysleptia?

CLORINDA	If you could say Dyslexia, that wouldn't be your only problem.

MARS	And you’re also Mad that I dumped you and that's the element in the Room.

CLORINDA	It’s ‘Elephant!’ It's an “Elephant” in the room, not, ‘Element!’ You know, what? Why don’t you just do Nola a solid and just renege on tonight’s invite, okay? Some other time. Ciao!

MARS	Whoah. Whoah. Whoah. Whoah. Whoah. Is that what's happening here?

NOLA	Mars? I asked you nicely to wait for me out front.

MARS	‘Cause you didn’t wanna tell me about some shit you got going down here tonight?

CLORINDA	That’s a perfectly good excuse.

NOLA	No, no, just I've had a lot on my mind with The Show. You don’t have to take it personally.
 
MARS	How could you ask me to bring your Art over and not expect me to figure out what the Hell is going on here? You think I’m a fucking retard?

CLORINDA	He’s got a good point.

MARS	Are you trying to say I’m Imbecilic?

NOLA	No, No. I'm saying you're reliable and I knew I could count on you...

MARS	Word?

NOLA	Yeah, word. I needed some help at the last minute after the other thing fell through.

MARS	Ohhh!

CLORINDA	Okay, enough with the Telenovela Nola. We really need to hang these. (Now.)

MARS	Well, I at least hope you had the dic-nity to not invite the other fucking dudes you’re seeing.

NOLA	This ain’t about a dude, Mars. It’s about the Art.

MARS	I know about Art! You spell it, A. R. T. I look at it, I see a R.A.T. But I know that if you don't feel nothing it ain’t Shit. Art is in the Eye of the Beholder. And I don’t like to Beholden to nobody. You know what I be holding? My Johnson. So you can't tell me that I can’t Hang after my Ass almost died trying to bring your Art over here. I’m of the Last Generation to be Hired and the First to be Fired! Lesson of the day : Protect your Neck when you sticking it out for other People!

CLORINDA	Now you know why I dumped him.

NOLA	What is up with you Two?

CLORINDA	What? Nobody told you to screw my Ex.

NOLA	I asked you and you said you didn’t care.

CLORINDA	I don’t but ‘Fuck a Girl Code,’ right?




DR. JAMISON	So, How are you feeling about your Group Show tonight?

NOLA	I feel vulnerable. My name is actually attached to this work. You know, the Street Campaign is like my Alter Ego. It was created out of my Assault and the thought of being judged on my Art never really crossed my mind with that work.

DR. JAMISON	Would you feel less vulnerable if you had included your Street Art in the, in the Group Show tonight?

NOLA	Maybe. “My Name Isn’t” is what brought me here, well, I mean the Assault. But I feel like I’ve moved on from that Pain.
 
DR. JAMISON	You feel like you can move forward?

NOLA	Maybe?

DR. JAMISON	Well we want to make certain that we can or should... Your Street Campaign is powerful. What are... What are your expectations for Tonight?

NOLA	This Group Show is an amazing opportunity that could shoot me off in the right direction. A serious turning point for me. And I want it to put me on the Map. Put me in a place where I can talk about my Art with other Artists. I want it to lead to some Serious Sales. I want to see my work hanging on the walls of Jay-Z, Michelle Obama, Oprah... Basically, there's a lot at Stake for me tonight. I could be on the Street the next time you see me... Crazy Girl on the Street making crazy Street Art!

DR. JAMISON	Here’s what I’m seeing. Nola Darling has moved on from the “My Name Isn’t” Work, which is fine, fine, but I think you haven’t fully embraced it first because there is, understandably, some negativity attached to it. And then, because there's a slight chance of, and and I don’t want to call it a problem, but of something triggering the assault again. Does that make sense?


NOLA	It does.

DR. JAMISON	Yeah, some things to think about. Okay.

NOLA	Thank you.

DR. JAMISON	If you start to Panic just use your Tools.
 
NOLA	I hope you can make it!

DR. JAMISON	Have a good Show, Nola.

NOLA	Thank you.

CLORINDA	Hi everyone, welcome. My name is Clorinda Bradford. Thank you so much for coming, this is a historic night for me, I'm so happy to spend it with you all. Welcome to the future. Welcome to the Diastopian. It is a movement of forward thinking Afrocentric Artists reaching across boundaries to Fabulate, Deconstruct, Redefine, Assert and Expand the Breadth and Reach of the Millennial Voices of the people of the African Diaspora. I'm so humbled and proud to introduce these four young beautifully brilliant artists. The sculptress : Zora Kneel Hurtin. The painter : Baptiste. Conceptual artist : Lemuel R. Richards. And my best friend, Miss Nola Darling. Thank you so much everyone so please enjoy and also remember that all of these incredible pieces are on sale tonight so please, lend your hand and support your black Brooklyn artist. One of you could be the next Basquiat and sell for a hundred mill. So please enjoy and mingle and introduce yourselves because they're fantastic people. Enjoy everyone, thank you so much.

NOLA	Thank you for coming.
 
CLORINDA	I would love for you both to meet someone very special. Dean, if you could meet one of the ‘Diastopian’ Artist, Miss Nola Darling.

DEAN	I’m here to represent My Beautiful Peoples. It’s Nation Time, Nation Time.

CLORINDA	Nation time. So you could talk about that.

DEAN	My Beautiful ‘Diastopian’ African Queen, I’m really feeling your (indistinct) Hot Combs.

NOLA	That’s actually not my work. These are my portraits right here.

EBONY	Darla.

NOLA	Darling, Nola.

EBONY	I’m, I'm Ebony. I Model for all of Dean’s Nude Black Women Paintings. Belinda, I have to put you down now so she can see.

BELINDA	No, Mother. I’m hungry.

EBONY	I still Breast Feed my Sweet Angel.

BELINDA	That’s why I don’t have any Friends.

EBONY	I said... get... down.

NOLA	Fascinating.
 
EBONY	Nobody captures the Black Female form like Dean does.

DEAN	We sell the t-shirts on E-Bay, so if you want one, I got the hook-up, if you want a cup.

NOLA	Cool.

EBONY	But I love the way you use those Barbaric Hot Combs and shove them back in Whitey’s face. Ssssss!

NOLA	Huh, again, not my work, my work, not... You know what, doesn't matter. Nice to meet you, Dean, Ebony, right? Nice to meet you Belinda.

BELINDA	Hello.

NOLA	Thank you.

DEAN	It's nation time. Nation time.

DANTON	I like it, I like, I like it.

NOLA	Thank you.

DANTON	Danton Phillips.

NOLA	Nola Darling.
 
DANTON	Haha yes, I may be old but I did just hear Clorinda introduce you.

NOLA	Right.

CLORINDA	Danton is one of my old friends you might have heard me talking about him.

DANTON	Yeah, I think she knows about the old part.

CLORINDA	He's a patron of the black arts. Would you be a dear and maybe get us a couple drinks?

NOLA	Hum, what would you like?

CLORINDA	Nola? Girl? She's good, she's funny. Yeah you got it. Scoot. Two champagnes, please. Yeah, he's fine.

NOLA	Yeah sure, why not.

CLORINDA	Girl you don’t have to stand in front of your Art Work like you're standing in front of your lemonade stand. Collectors like to know about the Artist as much as they do about the Art.

NOLA	Great.

CLORINDA	Your dress is perfect, you look great.

NOLA	Okay, okay.

CLORINDA	Walk around.

NOLA	Out there?
 
CLORINDA	Yes. You're good. You got this, you got this.

NOLA	Okay, okay.

CLORINDA	Good luck.




ZORA	When I was a little girl, growing up in Scottsville, Alabama. Every Saturday morning my mommy used to drag me into the kitchen to get my hair done, with a hot comb. Every Saturday morning she burned my scalp with that hot comb and I'd take off running. I still have the scars on my forehead to prove that she would burn the heck out of me. So, I've become obsessed with the hot combs...

WOMAN	Miss Darling? Hi!

NOLA	Hi.

WOMAN	I love your work.

NOLA	Oh thank you so much.

WOMAN	Are you kidding? You're incredible. I just, I had to tell you, your work is just, it's just incredible and I really really love it.

WOMAN	Me?

NOLA	Yeah.

WOMAN	Nah, I'm a great fan of your work and so I just wanted to tell you the best to you.

NOLA	You're right. I’m sorry. I totally do. But I'm sure we can fix that, right Opal?

OPAL	...Congratulations. This is... the turn out is...

SKYLAR	Awkward, Mom. Mom changes the Subject when she doesn’t want to Say No.

NOLA	I see. But yeah, it really is a good turn out. I’m kind of stunned, actually.

SKYLAR	You portrait is my favorite. This other stuff doesn’t fit in with yours. What? I’m precocious.

DEAN	Son, I’m married, don’t get it Twisted... Although, I wouldn’t turn down some stray Nappy Dugout, Tho.

MARS	Nah son, Nola’s a Bad Ass artist... First. Ya’know? She’s about to Blow the Fuck Up.

DEAN	I feel you, B. I’m a Bad Ass artist too but I'm a Revolutionary like Basquiat. Me and my N Word, we brought back from the Primitive. Took it straight out the Caves of Mother Africa. Ya heard? And I’ll punch a Cracker in his Neck he try to say Basquiat stole his style from Picasso. Don’t let my Skin colour get it Twisted, Tho. I know what White Pain is too... My Great Grandfather died in a Concentration Camp.

NOLA	I don’t know if you remember me but we've actually met before.

ZORA	Probably. Did Clorinda get you in the show?

NOLA	Yes.

ZORA	Of course.

BAPTISTE	Where did you say you were from Nola?
 
NOLA	I’m from here. I’m from Brooklyn.

BAPTISTE	Everybody is these days, I see.

JULIUS	Hello.

BAPTISTE	Mr. (Campbell?).

LEMUEL	Let's get out of here.

JULIUS	Hey, Nola Darling. So...

NOLA	Hi.
 
JULIUS	So, what's your work about?

NOLA	Hum, Seriously?! The Free Female Black Form. I’m a bit of an Emotional Painter.

JULIUS	A bit of...?

NOLA	I mean my previous work, I mean...

JULIUS	Okay, yes. Well, tell me more. I’m all Ears.

NOLA	Yes, yes. As one of the...

JULIUS	You know, I think I’m boring you. I tend to do that... So, sorry. Excuse Me.

JAMIE	Nola! Congrats on a Wonderful Show.

NOLA	Thank you.

JAMIE	My invite must have gotten lost in my Emails. So I'm glad you got the dress.

NOLA	Jamie, I’m sorry.

JAMIE	No no no no worries, no worries. Nothing that some Cash in the Doorman’s hand couldn’t fix...

NOLA	Don’t take it Personally, okay?

JAMIE	I didn’t get an invite, did I?
 
NOLA	Like I said, don’t take it to heart. It’s just business. You understand that, right?

JAMIE	I love the dress.

BELINDA	Nola.

MARS	Yo Nola!

NOLA	What the fuck are you doing here, Mars?

MARS	Look, Look! I got him! He’s busted.

NOLA	Who?

MARS	Look at this. This is the Smokin’ Gun. This is Dean’s Tag. Look at the “N”. See it through my Eyes. Yo, My Super-Power Skills. I’m using them to help you.

NOLA	Dean?

MARS	That Motherfucker's perpetrating a Fraud. I’m a Graffitiologist. I can spot all types of Styles. What I’m saying is, that Fake Ass Dean Haggin, his ”N” is the same as ONYX!

NOLA	I... Mars, I don’t care about that right now. Do you see where we're at?

MARS	You Busted your Ass for your Art. You got to step to him. Wait wait wait wait, you can't step to him now.

JULIUS	This guy.

NOLA	What? You just said to step to him.

MARS	Yes I said step to him, but I mean later. Step to him later. I got your back, I'll go with you, but you gotta... you can't...
 
NOLA	The fuck, Mars? Why did you get me all hamped up? He's right there.

MARS	I'm serious, alright. No but chill though, relax.

JAMIE	Yo Winny, What’s up? The fuck you mean?

NOLA	Would you excuse me for a second, please? Please? Hey, how is she?

BRENDA	Thank you, Jesus. I didn’t think you were coming. I know it’s hard seeing her like this.

NOLA	How is Shemekka doing?

BRENDA	The Doctor say She has an infection in her blood and they giving her antibiotics and medicine to maintain her Blood pressure.

NOLA	I’m so sorry Miss Brenda.

BRENDA	I don’t understand how this could have happened. I keep asking Shemekka how your Butt grow so from Pancake to Big Bottom? I knew something wasn’t right. My daughter works hard. She a single mother. She has a nice Hostess job at Appleby’s in Downtown Brooklyn. How does she end up getting some Back-Alley Butt injections and dancing in some damn Strip Club? Shemekka thinks she's so tough, but she is mush inside. She don’t have a lot of friends. Nola, I know she tell you everything. You must know something...
