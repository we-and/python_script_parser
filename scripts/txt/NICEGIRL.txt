(A Nice Girl Like You)
?

	
LUCY	Come on, it's just a word. Say it, already. Alright, you got this. want your hot, throbbing...Ugh. Uh-uh. No. Gross. And painful. Who would ask for hot, throbbing anything? Throbbing is what happens to your finger when you slam it in the car door. I want it now. Your hot, throbbing... Ok. Give it to me. And by "it", I mean I want your hot, throbbing... nope! No! Not at all convincing! God, Luce, it's a word. It's a word, just say it already. Alright. I want your hot, throbbing...For the love of god! Cock! Cock! Cock! Cock! Cock! Cock! Oh... um, my friend has this farm and there's this rooster.
	Troublemaker. Alright. Well, that is a... sentence that's just never gonna happen.

MUSIC	 That's life,  That's life, That's what all the people say,  You're riding high in April, Shot down in May, But I know I'm gonna change that tune, When I'm back on top, Back on top in June, I said that's life, That's life, And as funny as it may seem, Some people get their kicks, Stomping on a dream, But I don't let it, let it get me down, 'Cause this fine old world, It keeps spinning around, I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, A pawn and a king, I've been up and down and over and out, And I know one thing, Each time find myself, Flat on my face, I pick myself up and get back in the race, That's life, That's life, I tell you, I can't deny it, I thought of quitting, baby, But my heart just ain't gonna buy it, And if I didn't think it was worth one single try, I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly, I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, A pawn and a king,  I've been up and down and over and out, 
	 And I know one thing,  Each time I find myself, Flat on my face,  I just pick myself up and get back in the race... 

LUCY	Luce: Wait, what's he doing with his hand? That actually feels good. So that was an accident.

JEFF	You're so... good to me. Hey.

LUCY	Hmm?

JEFF	Are we good?

LUCY	Yeah.

JEFF	You like that? Ok. Good.

LUCY	Ok, sexy thoughts. A cabana on a hot, tropical beach. I'm getting a massage, which suddenly turns into spontaneous, unbridled sex. With Steve Carell.
	Only like in his newer movies, with silver hair. Yes! Yes!

JEFF	I'm coming!

LUCY	Yes! Wheat-free waffles! Shit, did I just say that out loud?

JEFF	Huh?

LUCY	Sorry. Just a second. That was what I forgot at the store. I couldn't remember all day. No, no, no, no. It's good. My mind is completely free. I'm ready now.

JEFF	Yeah... I don't think you are.

LUCY	We should get a ceiling fan. Hey, what're you doing? No- don't mess up my lists.

JEFF	Why? It's not like you ever finish any of them.

LUCY	That is not true. Just because you're angry, don't-

JEFF	Ok, look. Most women, during sex, you know, they say things like...I don't- like, "yes, yes, give it to me good".

LUCY	Who says that?

JEFF	People.

LUCY	People who you know? You honestly want me to yell out "yes, yes, give it to me good"?

JEFF	Well, it would be better than "wheat-free waffles". Why don't you just admit that you're not into sex?

LUCY	I'm so not not into sex.

JEFF	You didn't even take off your pyjamas!

LUCY	Yeah, well, they're comfortable! What're you doing?

JEFF	You gotta be kidding me. I have work to do. I'm on a deadline.

LUCY	You work in the garage, alright? Testing video games! Don't judge me.
	Sorry, Mr. Bach. I need something with a little more spirit. Great. Where is my cord?

LUCY	Oh my god, he's a regular.

HONEY PARKER	(VIDEO)(moaning) Don't stop!

LUCY	Oh my- oh my... that is a lot of vagina.

HONEY PARKER	(VIDEO)(moaning) Yes, yes, give it to me good!

LUCY	Oh my god, did she really just say that?

HONEY PARKER	(VIDEO)(moaning) Thank you, sweetie.

LUCY	I thought you were evolved. We met at a film festival, for god's sake!

JEFF	What're you talking about?

LUCY	What I'm talking about is that. What is that?

JEFF	I don't know, a girl?

LUCY	No. I'm a girl. That is a vixen.

JEFF	Whatever.

LUCY	Excuse me? What, I'm not enough?

JEFF	Look, ok, yeah. I'm sorry you're upset, but you kinda have this, like, irrational fear of intimacy or anything that can't be put on a list.

LUCY	You are talking sensuality to me as you are sitting there hacking heads off? Oh, is this funny to you? Really? Since when are you a porn person?

JEFF	Well, I'm a guy, so since always. Oh, see, that's bullshit. I just got killed by crossfire again.

LUCY	How are you being so nonchalant about this? In this day in age, when women are finally standing up to men who use sex as a tool of oppression, you're-

JEFF	Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah! I'm not oppressing anyone, ok? They put it out there, guys pay for it, and girls, everyone's happy. Have... have you ever watched a porn film?

LUCY	I think I just saw plenty, and I hardly think that the word film applies, not when it degrades the entire female species.

JEFF	Yeah, see, I don't think so. I think it's just a business.

LUCY	Oh. Oh, ok. I see. So it's just a collection of highly-skilled workers
	providing a service.

JEFF	Yeah, exactly. And the best are banking millions and the rest are compensated really well for their... artistry.

LUCY	Artistry?

JEFF	Yeah. Mmmhmm. Yeah. Yes. It's uh, it's kinda like you with your violin.
	Right? Is it so hard for you to understand that, you know, this is how some people express themselves?

LUCY	What I can't believe is that you are attempting to draw a parallel between what I do and this.

JEFF	That's because you're pornophobic.

LUCY	That's not even a word.

JEFF	You know, how uptight you are, it's kinda like your whole life problem. No, even words are too much for you.

LUCY	We're done.

JEFF	Wait, no, we're not done. Lucy. Come here. Ow, Jesus. Come on.

LUCY	Ugh.

JEFF	Lucy, come back. Hey! Wait! Just try saying something racy.

LUCY	Like what?

JEFF	Like, I don't know, like... use "hot, throbbing cock" convincingly in a sentence.

LUCY	Why would anyone do that?

JEFF	And by the way, since when do we spy on each other? I mean, spying? That's not cool.

LUCY	I wasn't spying! And I don't know who you are anymore.

JEFF	Yeah, well I don't know you worse!

LUCY	Well, I'm not gonna compete with all of that. So... so you need to decide. It's me or the porn! Really? That's what you consider an essential item?

JEFF	He's autographed. Come on, bud. Don't- don't crease and don't break. Alright, it's just you and me now. I hope you get that stick out of your ass!

LUCY	Why? So you can use it on yourself?! Hi, Mr. Glassell. Good morning.

MR. GLASSELL	It was.
	
PRISCILLA	Where are you? You're late. You're never late. I'm worried. Should I be worried?

LUCY	I'm coming. Sorry. Ok, so sorry.

PRISCILLA	Where have you been? The bride's about to start trotting up.

LUCY	Sorry. A bride on a horse. What could go wrong?

WEDDING COORD.	Play.
	
NESSA	Hello there, Mr. Best Man.

PAUL	Oh, no, that's actually my friend Grant. I think he's just a groomsman.

MINISTER	Matrimony.

HORSE	(whinnying)

MINISTER	The commemoration of an unshakable bond.

HORSE	(neighing)

PAUL	Oh, dear me.

GROOM	Oh my- oh my god.

NESSA	Yeah, no, this wedding is awesome.

PAUL	That could not have been the plan.

HORSE	(whinnying)

NESSA	 Oh gosh.

WOMAN	Is that horse poo?

MAN	God, it smells.

GROOM	Pretend it's not there.

PAUL	Oh, she's gonna remember this day, isn't she?

GROOM	You wanted the horse, ok?

PRISCILLA	Well, if she cancels she still has to pay us, right?

PAUL	Yes, especially because it was Grant who referred us for the job.

NESSA	I just- I'm sorry, I can't get over how he is so good-looking and you never told me about him.

PAUL	You don't date actual adults.

NESSA	Kale? He's an adult.

PAUL	He picks you up on a skateboard.

MINISTER	It's ok, everyone.

BRIDE	I'm ok.

NESSA	Why are you giving my dude such a hard time when this one over here, she's sleeping on Captain America sheets.

PAUL	Lucy, are you alright? Are you crying?

NESSA	I was just kidding.

PAUL	Yeah, it was just a joke about the sheets.

LUCY	Jeff left me. He moved out.

PRISCILLA	Are you ok?

PAUL	I'm so sorry, Luce, that's terrible.

MINISTER	Ok, now.

GROOM	Where were we?

MINISTER	We're going to get married now.

BRIDE	Yeah.
	
LUCY	I don't know, it's all such a blur. Actually, no. It started while we were having sex, and-

PAUL	Ok.

NESSA	Is that why you guys fought?

LUCY	I remembered an item off of my grocery list, so-

PRISCILLA	Oh, honey. How do you expect to survive marriage week after week, year after year? Sex with the same person in the same order for 27 years. Well, until you find yourself one day dressing up for the guy who sprays for bugs. Well, how do you expect to survive all that if you can't focus now?

LUCY	I might have focus issues but he is into porn, alright? It's disgusting! It was all over his computer, he is totally-

NESSA	A man?

PRISCILLA	All men look at dirty pictures, married or not. It's- it's how they maintain their vigour. Right, Paul?

PAUL	Well, it's-

PRISCILLA	When men start declining sexually by the age of 18. Once they hit 30 it's a ski slope.

PAUL	I beg your pardon.

PRISCILLA	Except for Paul. Who is, I'm sure, a sexual wonder.

NESSA	Didn't your girlfriend leave you for a woman, though?

PAUL	Ok, easy.

LUCY	Wait, does this mean you have porn?

PAUL	Hmm?

LUCY	And go to strip clubs?

PAUL	No, I do not go to strip clubs.

LUCY	Ever?

PAUL	I have, but it's not like I do.

LUCY	Do you use the internet?

PAUL	Define "use".

LUCY	What about prostitutes? No, not the ones who do it for crack. I mean like the ones you go to that thing in Vegas that I've seen on HBO.

PAUL	Do you know what? I'm out.

LUCY	I knew it.

NESSA	Hello. Ask me about sex. I'm right here.

LUCY	No. Your enthusiasm is really un-relatable.

NESSA	Oh, come on. I got this whole library of cliterature. You can just-

LUCY	You have what?

NESSA	Books you diddle to, babe. Please, girl. Tell me that you masturbate, at least.

LUCY	No. This is not about me, alright? This is about my boyfriend leaving because I think being a pervert is really inappropriate.

NESSA	I also have blindfolds, handcuffs, vibrators... Priscilla has them, too!

PRISCILLA	Oh, the buzz buzz, not the rest of it.

LUCY	You do?

PRISCILLA	It's called a personal massager. I got it at Brookestone.

PAUL	Really?

NESSA	Oh.

LUCY	Well... but you have Stanley.

PRISCILLA	Vibrators are necessary, my dear. Because life is short and explaining things to men is long.

LUCY	Sex to do list. Number one. Watch 25 porn films. Number two. Go to a sex store. Number three. Read cliterature. Number four. Visit strip club. Number five. Sex toy party. Number six. Sex seminar. Number seven. Test vibrators. Number eight. Internet porn - view some. Number nine. Consult a sex expert. Number ten. Brothel - visit. Number eleven. Meet a porn star.
	Number twelve. Use "hot, throbbing cock" convincingly in a sentence. There. And I can even check the last one off right now. For the love of god, cock! Cock! Cock! Cock! Cock! Cock. I want your cock!

GRANT	Well done.

LUCY	Cock. God!

GRANT	Hey!

GROOM	Woah! Oh, Grant, you gotta go check out the ballroom, man. The bridal party's twerkin'. Woah.

GRANT	You're kidding.

GROOM	Ah, ah!

LUCY	Ugh! Oh my god, are you serious?

GRANT	Hello?

LUCY	I can't believe you would do this to me. What, Jeff? I'm not enough for you?
	Ugh!

GRANT	Everything alright in there? Coming in. You alright, love? You want me to get the doctor?

LUCY	What? Why- no. What, because I'm on the floor? No. No. No, no, no. I'm just medicating. Tating. Meditating.

GRANT	I just heard crying or yelling.

LUCY	Chanting.

GRANT	Chanting?

LUCY	Yeah.

GRANT	Yeah.
	Just coming to check to make sure everything's fine?

LUCY	Yeah. No, I always do like a little chant for the gride and broom. Before the first dance.

GRANT	How do you mean?

LUCY	Oh, you know, like a chant.

GRANT	Yeah, no, I don't.

LUCY	Yeah, just sort of...-Close my eyes and go Chanting...

GRANT	Which obviously means something.

LUCY	Unity.

GRANT	Yeah.

LUCY	Yeah. It means unity in that they're now one. And yet they're two. So, really it's about being strong enough to make one one out of two ones. And yet still be two.

GRANT	Yeah. Makes sense. Totally get it.

LUCY	You do?

GRANT	Yeah. It's... like a building. It's only as strong as its weakest pillar.

LUCY	Yeah, but is that true? Because it seems to me that if you have enough pillars, like say you're the acropolis, I think you could get away with one crappy pillar.

GRANT	Sure. Except for earthquakes, hurricanes, strong winds...

LUCY	Aliens.

GRANT	Well, we can't do much about that. But you make a good point. One in which I happen to believe in.

LUCY	Uh... what- what point is that?

GRANT	Well, you can't be useful in a two until you figure yourself out as a one.

LUCY	Hmm. Cocktail?

GRANT	Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

LUCY	Well, here's to me. That was brilliant. But you're right. No time for cocktails.
	The two ones must waltz so this one one must play. Ok. Alrighty.

GRANT	Hey. Don't you need this? Or you chant the waltz, too?

LUCY	Sometimes. I'm not pornophobic.

PRISCILLA	All men look at dirty pictures.

HONEY PARKER	Oh, Jeff.

JEFF	Yes, yes, give it to me good. You're pornophobic.

NOSFERATU	I cannot drink her blood, she's pornophobic.

LUCY	Am I not enough?

DOCTOR	Looks like she's suffering from stage four pornophobia.

JEFF	Say something racy.

LUCY	It's a word. Just say it already.

JEFF	Pornophobic.

LUCY	Jeff left me.

JEFF	Pornophobic.

MINISTER	Today we gather here to remember Lucy Nell, who died alone from pornophobia. She died in the house she inherited from her grandmother
	that she was only able to fill with unfinished lists, not love.

JEFF	You're pornophobic!

LUCY	Ok. Sexpressions of Lust? Please. Madame Mischief's Boudoir Secrets. Maybe it's a historical fiction? And who doesn't like secrets? Better get one more for back-up. Bad Sally. That can't be right. Oh god. Faline springs from the house as Michele passionately gives chase. Running for her life, Michele grabs Faline's wrist and twirls her until he backs her into an erect pillar.
	He could almost taste her ruby lips but Faline thrusts her knee into Michele, spins him around. Seizing the moment, Faline pulls out a hidden pistol sheathed on her thigh and pulls it up to his chin. And then stops.
	Michele takes one strong finger and slowly drags the pistol downwards.
	Faline watches in wonder as the cold steel surrenders to its final destination. Michele's manhood. Michele walks his finger across the barrel and cocks the gun. Faline knows what she wants and she decides to take it. (gasping) Whew. Salt shaker is done. I can check that off my list. Hello.

PRISCILLA	We have chocolate, mimosas, tissues, sympathy. Wait, why do you look so good?

NESSA	Where did you get those jeans?

LUCY	No reason. Nowhere. And pity's not why I called.

PRISCILLA	I told you we need When Harry Met Sally.

NESSA	Mmmhmm.
	You do chocolates, I'm on cocktails.

LUCY	No, really. I'm fine. I am. For, I have renewed life purpose in the form of a research project with which I need your help.

PRISCILLA	(laughs)

NESSA	She said research. She called me for research.

PRISCILLA	You're losing it.

PRISCILLA AND NESSA	(laughing)

LUCY	We're doing number two and the train is leaving in one minute.
	Guys, do you think I'm gonna need this?

NESSA	Best break-up ever.

PRISCILLA	Oh god.

PRISCILLA AND NESSA	(excited chatter)

GERTRUDE	This is your Nissan Leaf, this is your Mercedes C Class,
	and this is the Maserati of vibrators.
	A serious piece of equipment for only the most experienced user.

NESSA	Oh. Sold.

GERTRUDE	Using it could desensitize you to men forever.

NESSA	I'll take one. Hey, Luce! I found something for ya. He doesn't say irritating things, he's a feminist, doesn't watch football, or fart.

PRISCILLA	Well, none of them do at first.

RICKI	Can I help you with that cock ring?

LUCY	No. No, I got this. I was just checking...

RICKI	Sure.

GRANT	Everything alright over there?

LUCY	Sorry, just um... looking for... for a Mother's Day gift.

GRANT	Oh. You know, I was wondering what a nice girl like you was doing in a place like this.

LUCY	I could ask you the same thing.

GRANT	Go ahead.

LUCY	What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?

GRANT	Oh...

LUCY	Oh!

GRANT	Busy day you got there.

LUCY	Oh-

GRANT	Uh, it's amazing you have the time with all the violin playing and the chanting.

LUCY	Of course you remember me.

GRANT	It's not every day I run into a beautiful girl with such a propensity for crouching.

LUCY	Did he actually just use the word "propensity"?

GRANT	Oh hey. Adopted this puppy. And breakfast is ready. And the dishes are done.

NESSA	Hey, you're the best man from the wedding with the pooping horse?

GRANT	Oh, yeah, I was just a groomsman.

NESSA	Oh, well, I'm Nessa. I was a part of the quartet.

GRANT	Oh, yeah. You guys were great.

NESSA	Thank you. I play the cello. Um, yeah. It's, you know, the big one between your legs? Lucy over here, she plays the violin.

GRANT	So it's Lucy, is it?

NESSA	So fancy meeting you here. What're you doing?

GRANT	Oh yeah, um, good question. I'm looking for a Mother's Day gift.

NESSA	Oh, really? Me too. I mean, I would never be here for myself. Or would I?

LUCY	Nessa.

GRANT	Uh, I'm actually an architect. Paul Goodwin works at my firm.

LUCY	Right. Yeah, I vaguely remember him mentioning something like that.

GRANT	I'm ah, working on a job upstairs to reconfigure the office space.

LUCY	Oh.

GRANT	Not nearly as interesting as what's going on on that list.

LUCY	Oh, no. This is purely a research project. Yeah, honestly I can't help it.
	I went to Harvard so I'm research-y. Actually, that's where I met Paul.

NESSA	Really? You're using the H-bomb on the best man? I just can't. I'm gonna go talk to Priscilla. And what the hell is up with your lips, girl?

GRANT	I'm Grant.

PUSHY ALBERT	Who works here? Did I hear you say you work here?

LUCY	Why, yes he does.

GRANT	So does she.

PUSHY ALBERT	I just wanna find out if this works.

LUCY	Actually, sir, I am very familiar with this product. It's one of my favourites. In fact, I've got it on right now.

PUSHY ALBERT	What do you mean, you're wearing it now? On what?

LUCY	On my lips.

PUSHY ALBERT	You put it on your lips?

GRANT	Uh, Luce, I don't think you put erection cream on your lips.

LUCY	Oh my god.

PRISCILLA	Oh. Excuse me? Do these come in extra-large?

GRANT	Got you some ice from the cafe.

LUCY	Thanks.

GRANT	Yeah, I thought your lips looked a little... You got a chant for this sort of thing? Woah. Can I have your number?

LUCY	You want my number?

GRANT	Yeah.

LUCY	Wait, really?

GRANT	I have a gig you might be interested in playing.

LUCY	That's awesome.

GRANT	I'll um, I'll wait out here.

LUCY	Bye.

MUSIC	Big girls don't cry, Big girls don't cry, Big girls Don't cry, They don't cry, 

LUCY	So his dad co-chairs this annual insurance commissioner's dinner and he wants you and me to walk around and do the wandering minstrel thing.

PRISCILLA	First the wedding and now this? Is he your new booking agent?

NESSA	Excuse me, why not all of us?

LUCY	Uh, I don't know, but you did make it a point to tell him that your legs are pretty occupied while you play.

PRISCILLA	(laughs)

NESSA	Will he be there?

LUCY	He didn't say.

PRISCILLA	So, with the exception of the H-bomb incident, and putting erection cream on your lips, I'd say this was very successful. You had a nice conversation with a handsome man, we got a gig out of nowhere, and you got Burt.

MUSIC	Big girls don't cry, Big girls don't cry, Big girls don't cry, Big girls don't cry, Big girls don't cry, (playing violin) 

LUCY	Hmm. You know, after one week of being broken up with Jeff after four years of dating and I cannot believe how great I feel.

PAUL	Well, what I can't believe is that we're actually doing this.

CHUCK	Alright, Jersey, how we doin'? All six of you.

PAUL	Alright, first thing's first. I'm gonna go grab us some drinks.

CHUCK	Alright, now for the sexiest identical twins with the hottest dance moves.
	Everybody give it up for Cherry and (singing)  ... Dallas. Yeah!

WES	Hey Wes, can I trouble you for two beers, mate? Pretend like you don't know me. Brilliant. Did he say Cherry and Dallas?

LUCY	You know, this is not what I expected.

PAUL	Shh.

LUCY	Why? Are you afraid I'm gonna wake them up?

PAUL	Oh, come on. They're performers and you're talking over them. Don't be rude. It's disrespectful.

LUCY	I'm just saying.

PAUL	Hi, Cynthia. Loving the hair. How are you doing tonight?

LUCY	Hi. Thank you. Oh, it's a little cold in here. Can I-

PAUL	Actually, we're totally fine. Why don't you keep the change? You know what? Throw that in for good measure. Don't embarrass me.

LUCY	Embarrassment's the least of your problems.

PAUL	Ok, I need to level with you. It's not cold in here. It's optimal. Get with the program. Where are you going?

LUCY	Getting with the program.

PAUL	Don't do that! Lucy, come back, please.

LUCY	Hi. Your wife didn't send me here to spy on you, I promise.
	Don't worry. I wonder how these girls stay in such good shape. Quick question for you. Do you do Pilates or... oh, wow.

PAUL	Oh, nice, Luce.

LUCY	Thank you so much. Wait a second. She is totally thinking about her shopping list. Ha! Woo!

PAUL	(whistles)

LUCY	Oh. Ok. I'm just gonna see what-

CHERRY	She's trying to take my money!

LUCY	No, I can't make change?

NESSA	No, you did not.

PRISCILLA	What were you thinking?

LUCY	As pleasing as her vagina thrusts were, it just- it was not a $20 kind of happy.

BEATRICE	Welcome to the Pleasure Palace Party. We got the dildos, we got the vibrators, so look around, don't be shy. If you wanna get to the top of the mountain you gotta go equipped.

LUCY	Oh. I did learn one very important thing at the strip club. If naked enough it doesn't matter if you can actually dance. Oh, I know what these are. People use these for meditating.

NESSA	No, those are ben-wah balls. 50 Shades? Book two?

PRISCILLA	Ben who?

BEATRICE	You take two of those, you stick 'em up your lady, and just hold them for a couple of hours, ok?

LUCY	Wait, what?

NESSA	Oh my god. Those are for Kegel exercises. You could do 'em in the car. Shit, I'm doing them right now.

PRISCILLA	Experience intense natural pleasure as each weighted ball rolls and moves with you to give you a mind-blowing internal massage.

BEATRICE	Now, you're gonna sculpt a banana into a penis with your teeth.

WOMEN	(clamouring)

BEATRICE	Catch that! Oh yeah, get that banana.

LUCY	Well, I'll never look at a banana the same way again. And neither will Paul.
	Sex toy party. Check.

PRISCILLA AND NESSA	(cackling)
	
PRISCILLA	Wait, why'd you stop?

LUCY	Uh, nothing. Nothing. I think I just... I really need to go to the bathroom.

PRISCILLA	Oh my, well go! It's right down there.

LUCY	I don't think I can make it that far. Oh god. It's gonna come out.

PRISCILLA	What is? (laughs)

LUCY	Not a word. Not a word. Uh-uh.

PRISCILLA	(laughing)

LUCY	Ok. Oh. Oh! I don't think I can bend over.

PRISCILLA	Because there's a second one?

LUCY	Three.

PRISCILLA	Oh!

LUCY	There are three more. I bought two boxes.

PRISCILLA	I see.

LUCY	For Kegels.

PRISCILLA	Say no more.

LUCY	I need you to pick it up.

PRISCILLA	You know, I didn't think there were limits to our friendship. I realize it's just not true.

LUCY	Oh, this is not funny. It's not funny, ok? I only wore these to a work function
	because I knew we would be standing for three hours and, you know, I wanted to tone.

PRISCILLA	(laughing)

LUCY	Stop! Stop, ok? If you make me laugh another ball will pop out.

PRISCILLA	Oh god, I'm so...

LUCY	I need help here. Please.

PRISCILLA	Ok, ok. Let's go.

LUCY	(gasps)

PRISCILLA	What was that?

LUCY	I don't know. When I walk my legs just sort of rub together and I'm already so, so- oh my god, I might-

PRISCILLA	Hallelujah?

LUCY	Yeah.

PRISCILLA	Ok, we're gonna have to risk it. Lucy, if you do this while holding my hand
	this friendship will never be the same.

GRANT	Ladies, you look like you're having a good night.

PRISCILLA	Some of us more than others.

LUCY	Hi.
	What're you doing here?

GRANT	Oh, seeing my dad. He's on the board with the trust. It's irrelevant. Now I'm seeing you.

LUCY	Have you met Priscilla?

GRANT	No, how are you?

LUCY	The leader of our quartet. My dear friend, who always comes to my rescue.

GRANT	Oh, you need a lot of that?

PRISCILLA	No, not at all, but even still, she's just always waiting for the other ball to drop. I mean shoe.

LUCY	Is it hot in here?

PRISCILLA	Yeah, it is.

LUCY	Hmm.

PRISCILLA	Um, I see someone that I...I don't see anyone. I'm just getting out of the way.

GRANT	Are you tired?

LUCY	Am I tired?

GRANT	Yeah, you seem a bit out of breath.

LUCY	Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No, I just sort of get that way when I play.

GRANT	Oh, I get it. You're amazing.

LUCY	(gasps) Sweet Jesus.

GRANT	Oh, what was that?

LUCY	Hmm?

GRANT	That.

LUCY	No, my back just gets that way when I stand and play.

GRANT	Alright. Are you cold?

LUCY	Mmmhmm. Yeah.

GRANT	Oh, let's get you moving.

LUCY	Oh.

GRANT	Come on.

LUCY	Ah.

GRANT	You ok?

LUCY	Yeah. Yeah. Just warming up a little.

GRANT	If I didn't know better, your lips look beautifully deflated this evening.

LUCY	(laughs) (gasps)

GRANT	Women don't usually find me funny.

LUCY	It's my pleasure. Truly. Oh. Oh.

GRANT	Oh, what was that?

LUCY	What was what?

GRANT	Something just hit my foot.

LUCY	Is that a bird?

GRANT	There's a bird?

LUCY	Nope. Nope. Sorry, my mistake. Weird.

GRANT	Anyway.

LUCY	Hmm?

GRANT	I was thinking...

LUCY	Yeah?

GRANT	If you're not too busy-

LUCY	Never.

GRANT	(indistinct) Would you like to-

LUCY	Yes.

GRANT	Have dinner with me?

LUCY	Dear god, yes!

HERBERT	(speaking French)

JEFF	So you call me up out of the blue to ask me how good you were in bed?

LUCY	Mmmhmm. Out of a percentage out of 100. But if you must, I will accept a letter grade.

JEFF	Did you meet someone?

LUCY	What? No. No. I was just wondering-

JEFF	You did. You're seeing someone.

LUCY	Yeah, I am. I'm sorry. It's very new-

JEFF	No, no. It's a- I'm relieved, ok? 'Cause I'm... I'm also seeing someone else, too.

LUCY	You are?

JEFF	Yeah.

LUCY	Huh. Wow. Halloween.

JEFF	Yeah.

LUCY	Right after we broke up. Oh, or is that how she dresses all the time?

JEFF	That's funny. I miss your sense of humour. Is that- I'm sorry, is that bad for me to say that I miss something about you? Uh... so, how are the- how's your lists coming?

LUCY	Oh, very well, thank you. Yeah, after the porn thing I made a list that's all about sex. And I recently went to both a porn shop and a strip club.

JEFF	(laughing)

LUCY	What?

JEFF	You- no, you're...you're hilarious. You see, this- you, us being friends, this rocks.

LUCY	Yeah, it's great. Uh, but, sex with me. How was it?

JEFF	Oh, right. Um... it was fine.

LUCY	Jeff, literally choose any letter.

JEFF	Ok, uh, geez. Uh... like A through F, right?

LUCY	Yes.

JEFF	Ok. Uh, you are a...

LUCY	D. It's in room D.

PRISCILLA	Are you sure? It doesn't say "sex seminar".

LUCY	They're not gonna call it that. It's this one. It has to be. Come on.

RENEE LOWELL	Proficiency in sex is a must. It is the universal language of humanity. You're tardy. Take a seat.

PRISCILLA	Did you invite her?

LUCY	No. What could she have to learn?

RENEE LOWELL	To walk around speaking slang is to be ignorant to one's self.

LUCY	What're you doing here?

NESSA	I just came here to do research for you.

RENEE LOWELL	Number one miscommunication slang speakers make is to think of it as a male -centric activity. That is, they think about when men intercourse
	with women that it's all about the guy. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! From this moment on you will refer to sexual communication as the gift that you will give to only a worthy man, from you, the soon to be supremely empowered woman! (applause)

LUCY	Oh, hit- oh wow, you are tense. Yeah, I don't think smacking it like that is part of the technique.

NESSA	Kale, he left me for someone his own age so I'm just- I can't deal with men right now.

LUCY	Oh, Nessa, I'm so sorry. Here. I'm gonna help you. Ok?

NESSA	It's like we're in Ghost and you're my Patrick Swayze. Oh, of course you get to be Demi Moore.

RENEE LOWELL	It takes a village.

LUCY	Ok, so five weeks until my audition for the Philharmonic- I'm not getting any better, am I?

PRISCILLA	No, you're really not.

LUCY	What?

PRISCILLA	'Cause you're already a genius. Well, it's true, and you know it. You just gotta get out of there.

LUCY	Did you know that the female ferret will die if she goes into heat and can't find a mate?

PRISCILLA	Jeff was the rodent, not you. What about the best man?

LUCY	Groomsman.

PRISCILLA	Hasn't he called? You really should ask Paul what his story is because-

LUCY	No. No, he did. We're going out on Saturday.

PRISCILLA	You are?!

LUCY	Oh.

PRISCILLA	That's wonderful!

LUCY	Oh. You're at a ten.

PRISCILLA	Well, what are your plans? I mean, you could do a dinner cruise. Oh, a hot air balloon.

LUCY	What is with you today?

PRISCILLA	Nothing, I'm just happy for you.

LUCY	Oh... what are those?

PRISCILLA	Stan got me diamonds.

LUCY	Oh my god. Was it the seminar?

PRISCILLA	I have a sex life again after 27 years. Stan and I are doing it like high school kids on prom night.

LUCY	Oh, so meaning it's over in five minutes and you get nothing out of it.

PRISCILLA	Except a bad reputation. Anyway, enough about me. Why aren't you thrilled about the best man?

LUCY	I am. I... don't you think he's a little out of my league?

PRISCILLA	I'm not even gonna dignify that question. You're just afraid to get back on the horse. Lucy, it's like riding a bike. Or maybe a pogo stick.

LUCY	I'm just freaking out because in my effort to be supremely empowered I insisted on planning the date. And I've got nothing.

PRISCILLA	Well, if you're interested, Stan got us two tickets to the Dr. Becker taping on Saturday night. VIP seats.

LUCY	Which is...?

PRISCILLA	She's a sex expert. I showed Stan the list. He got very inspired. Anyway, if I promised to make it worth his while I'm sure I can get him to stay at home.

LUCY	Ok, if I promise to take the tickets do you promise to never talk about you and Stan sexually communicating ever again?

PRISCILLA	Deal.

LUCY	Ok.

PRISCILLA	Can I just tell you one thing?

LUCY	Alright, yes.

PRISCILLA	I'm gonna get my labia tightened.

LUCY	(laughing)
	
GRANT	What do you think about oyster shooters?

LUCY	Mmm, aren't oysters more of a third date kind of food?

GRANT	Yes, good point. It's not like you're taking me to a sex show.

LUCY	Lecture by a progressive, world renowned researcher who went to Yale.
	Which is definitely not Harvard. But she happens to be discussing human sexuality and I-

GRANT	I know, I know, consult an expert is on your list. I'm messing with you.

LUCY	And just because we're going to a lecture like this doesn't make me a sure thing, you know.

GRANT	Me neither.

LUCY	Good. Wouldn't want you getting the wrong idea.

GRANT	What idea might that be?

LUCY	I don't know, I just wouldn't want you misinterpreting my list, 'cause I'm really not that kind of girl.

GRANT	And what kind of girl are you?

LUCY	That's for me to know and for you to wonder. Ok, well now I'm gonna ask you a bunch of things so I can make a meaningful snap judgement about you without being distracted by all your charming, attractive... you-ness.

GRANT	Is this where you ask me for my tax return? 'Cause I didn't bring it.

LUCY	Uh, no. I was just gonna ask you what your favourite book was.

GRANT	Um, sorry. My last girlfriend did that on the first date.

LUCY	And you still ended up dating her? Oh. Alright, yeah. Your last girlfriend must have been a supermodel.

GRANT	She was a model, yes, but super, no. Definitely not. And she's certainly not Harvard material.

LUCY	Ah. Well, as an artist, I do not require financial documentation. Being well kept doesn't really apply to me.

GRANT	And yet you seem to be kept very well. That is corny.

LUCY AND GRANT	(laughs)

GRANT	Uh, let's do the books. I have two.

LUCY	I also have two favourites.

GRANT	Ladies first.

LUCY	Nope.

GRANT	Huh?

LUCY	No. I asked you first.

GRANT	Revealing book love is a very personal thing.

LUCY	I know. That's why it's my stock first date question. It's gonna tell me everything I need to know about you.

GRANT	Are you sure you wanna know?

LUCY	Yeah, you're right. It could be the end of something good before it even starts.

GRANT	Or it could be the start of something good that doesn't end. What the hell's in this drink?

LUCY	(laughs) Ok, alright. Let's just state our books.

GRANT	Yep.

LUCY	And let's get this ship to sinking, ok?

GRANT	Please.

LUCY	Alright.

GRANT	Yeah. At the same time, count of three?

LUCY	Yes. Alright. Ok. One, two, three. Everything That Rises Must Converge,
	and The Story of Your Life.

GRANT	The Story of Your Life and Everything That Rises Must Converge.

LUCY	Well, you like them in the wrong order.

GRANT	Yeah. It's definitely not gonna work.

LUCY	This is the Dr. Becker show?

ANNIE	Yeah. Hi, welcome.

LUCY	Hi. Oh, uh, will Dr. Becker be out soon?

ANNIE	That is Dr. Becker.

PA	Alright, let's get everybody in their seats now-

LUCY	Wait, she's a Magna Cum Laude Yale PhD?

ANNIE	Follow me.

PA	Alright, ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. The show is about to start. Dr. Becker, you're on in three, two...

LUCY	Ok. I am so sorry. I had no idea-

GRANT	Are you kidding me? This is the most interesting date I have ever gone on
	in my entire life.

DR. BECKER	Welcome. Tonight's guest is both a true pleasure to have and a departure from my usual science-based approach to sexual enlightenment.

LUCY	Science was nothing like this where I went to school.

GRANT	Really? I thought boarding schools were known for sexual enlightenment.

DR. BECKER	Please help me welcome Madam Swarovska, world renowned sexual psychic.

GRANT	What's a sexual psychic?

LUCY	Someone who can do the pull and pray method of birth control?

GRANT	(snorts)

LUCY	You snorted. Ok, I'm leaving.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	That one. She suffers. Oh?

DR. BECKER	Oh. Madame Swarovska, can you explain to our audience what it is that you're doing?

LUCY	And me, would be nice.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	I am assessing the aura. Seeing what colours surround her.

LUCY	Sounds lovely. Thank you.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	For most people, yes. For you, no. For you, is grey.

LUCY	Grey?

DR. BECKER	Are you saying that she's sexually...

MADAME SWAROSKA	Grey! Yes.

LUCY	Well, lucky for me neutrals are in for fall. You know, we can go like five minutes ago.

GRANT	No, no, this is awesome. This is great.

DR. BECKER	How about we get you on stage, Miss...?

LUCY	Uh, Lu...Lulubell.

DR. BECKER	Well, come on up here, Lulubell, so Madame Swarovska can read you. Come on. You're safe.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Yes, the grey one is in deep struggle with the sex.

DR. BECKER	I often discuss a condition called sexual attention deficit disorder.
	SADD. Sad, for short. Which involves frequent mental wanderings
	of a non-sexual nature during intercourse. Might that be what-

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Yes, but also lack of experience.

AUDIENCE	(audience laughs)

LUCY	Oh, trust me, I- I have plenty of experience.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	The cards say no.

LUCY	No, I assure you. I know what I'm doing.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	The cards say no.

AUDIENCE	(audience murmurs)

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Oh, I see. You are very old when you are first having sex.

LUCY	Surely you mean old enough.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	No, I mean old.

LUCY	Oh.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Oh, old is why you are only having sex with four people?

DR. BECKER	Is that true? Four?

LUCY	No.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	No?

LUCY	Well, yeah. But what's wrong with that?

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Oh, one does not count. It ends uh, how you say... prematurely.

LUCY	Oh, that one looks promising.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Yeah, when is upright yes, but for you is reverse.

LUCY	Oh.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Oh. Grey one.

LUCY	Yeah?

MADAME SWAROVSKA	You're not having the big booms?

LUCY	What?

MADAME SWAROVSKA	The big booms. The rolling thunder. The crotch magic, you know? Like, oh yeah, baby. I love it! You know? Like, woah Nelly gets really crazy, that kind of sex. Like uh, like magic time. Crotch magic. Blast it off. Blast up inside, you know? I can't handle it anymore! Like... woo! This type of thing. What- how you call it?

DR. BECKER	She sees... um, you don't orgasm.

LUCY	I got it. Thanks.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Oh, but you're giving booms to yourself sometime, that's good. That's ok. That's something, huh? That's nice. You keep that going, ok? Now I'm going to see about the one you come here with. This guy over here.

LUCY	Oh, oh.

MADAME SWAROVSKA	Hey, now. This is really lucky. The devil's card in reverse is representing
	like breaking freedom from restraint. This guy is going to give you the big booms! Yes.

DR. BECKER	Isn't that amazing how accurate the Madame is?
	
MUSIC	What a difference a day makes, 
	
GRANT	Well uh, thank you again for a uh, revealing night.

LUCY	Once again, she was so not right about anything she said.

GRANT	No.

LUCY	By the way.

GRANT	She's crazy. She said I rocked your world when we barely even know
	each other, let alone have had, you know, sex.

LUCY	Right? I know. Like, what was she even saying? That just me being close to you I get like all... I don't know. Sorry, no. Look how in control I am around you.

GRANT	Right.

LUCY	Anyway, yeah, she was wrong. She was crazy wrong.

GRANT	Who knows?

LUCY	Anyway, twice again, for the official record, I had absolutely no idea about tonight and I am so, so, so sorry. I'm really sorry.

GRANT	I'm not.

MUSIC	 What a difference a day makes... 
	
LUCY	Goodnight.

GRANT	Yeah.

PAUL	I swear you're going to get me fired. Or even worse, assigned to awful jobs.
	Grant's a pretty big deal at the firm, you know.

PRISCILLA	And you're a big deal to us, Paul, but this isn't about you.

PAUL	Yet.

PRISCILLA	The psychic didn't say anything positive?

LUCY	Just that I wouldn't end up alone.

PAUL	Well, that could just mean she thinks you'll get a cat. What? Ok, let me paint a picture for you. If Grant is the devil and not even he can get lucky with her, then perhaps poor Luce is destined to end up with a litter of cats.
	But seriously, let's get back on point. How did you two leave things? Am I gonna have to avoid him at the office?

LUCY	Can't hear you. I'm shopping.

PAUL	Luce, quick question. Isn't this the section for girls who do get kissed?

LUCY	Hey. Just so you know, he said he was gonna call this weekend to make plans. And no, I'm in the right section.

PAUL	Mmmhmm.

LUCY	Guys, I have to tell you something.

PRISCILLA	Good god, you're not preg- how?

LUCY	What? No. The question would be who, since I can't even seem to get a guy past the front porch. You know those jeans that make my ass look like a sorority girl's?

PRISCILLA	Here? We're going to the women's section.

LUCY	Nope, not the women's.

PRISCILLA	Men's? That's brilliant.

LUCY	Right here. In maternity. Look, they have this stretchy stuff that goes over the stomach and just kinda smooths everything out. I know, you think I'm pathetic.

PAUL	No, no. I'm just trying to figure out my size in women's.
	
	
PRISCILLA	Who knew strings could accompany threesome-type sex so well?

NESSA	I say we rehearse like this all the time.

PRISCILLA	(laughs)

NESSA	I'm so surprised you're still doing the list. I'm psyched.

LUCY	I've been labelled sexually grey. It kinda solidified the mission. And I've been waiting for Grant to call me all week so I figured I might as well just watch my 25 films.

NESSA	Why are you waiting for him to call? Why don't you call him?

LUCY	Anyway, so I had one of these on when it came time to practise one day, so...

NESSA	Well, if it means anything, I've never heard you play this good, girl.

LUCY	Don't be ridiculous.

PRISCILLA	A month until the Philharmonic auditions remember us when.

NESSA	Mmmhmm.

LUCY	Oh my god. It's him.

PRISCILLA	The best man?

LUCY	Yeah. Do I- what, do I answer?

PRISCILLA	No!

NESSA	No. Yes. I don't know.

PAUL	Ok, answer it or I will. I already suffered through high school once.

LUCY	Ok. Ok. Hey.

GRANT	Hey yourself. It's Grant. Listen, sorry I haven't called you...

PRISCILLA	"Hey"? The man of your dreams calls and you say "hey"?

LUCY	Shh!

GRANT	Uh, me shush?

LUCY	No, sorry. Not you. I'm with the quartet.

NESSA	Rehearsing some porn! (laughs)

GRANT	Did she say you're watching porn?

LUCY	No. No, she did not. She said "horn". Yeah, we're adding a French horn to the group.

GRANT	Ah, well, I can't help you with that.

LUCY	So um, you're working on a Saturday?

GRANT	Uh, listen. Sorry I haven't called all week. I've been bloody busy in non-stop meetings and-

LUCY	He was out of town all week.

PRISCILLA	That's it. Woohoo!

PAUL	Oh, thank god.

PRISCILLA	There it is.

PAUL	Oh!

PORN STAR	(moaning)

PRISCILLA	Oh, Paul, your ass.

LUCY	Turn it down! Turn it down!

PORN STARS	(moaning)

LUCY	Sorry, Nessa just stubbed her toe.

NESSA	Why me?

GRANT	Anyway, look. I know it's last minute but I was thinking,
	if you wanted to go out-

LUCY	I'd love to. Yes. Whatever it is.

PAUL	So sorry!

NESSA	(laughing)

PRISCILLA	Not sorry.

MUSIC	Baby, baby, close your eyes, Baby, baby, don't think twice,  I want you,  I want you, Baby, baby, close your eyes, Baby, baby, don't think twice,  I want you, I want you, I want you, want you,  want you, want you, 
	
	
LUCY	Ok. Ok. Here we go.

GRANT	Wait. Wait.

LUCY	What? Mmm-mmm.

GRANT	No? You want me to stop?

LUCY	What? No. Go.

GRANT	No? As in it's a no go?

LUCY	No. No. Keep going.
	
GRANT	The perfect pants for you two.

LUCY	Hi.

GRANT	Hey. Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. Um, I was just gonna...

LUCY	Oh. Ok.

GRANT	I'll call you.

LUCY	Yeah. Oh my god. No! No! Grant! Wait! Shit. No. No. Grant! Wait! Grant? Grant! If it's about the porn I can quit any time! What? So I watch porn. Big fucking deal.

MR. GLASSELL	As long as it's consensual. No judgement.

LUCY	Stupid. Useless! This tastes like crap! Disgusting! Ugh! Don't even work! Ugh! God, I can't believe this. And you. Stupid.
		
MORGANA	Ugh, Phil's penthouse is just so gorge. My boyfriend and I walked in and he was all "this place owns the skyline".

PAUL	Well, it did take us about a year to complete so you can imagine what it cost.

MORGANA	I don't do numbers.

NESSA	Me neither, but like how much?

PAUL	Anyway, if you thought the penthouse is impressive you really ought to see his place in the Hamptons. I can't wait to own multiple homes in which I don't actually live.

MORGANA	My boyfriend and I love the Hams.

LUCY	The Hams? Is that what we're calling it now?

MORGANA	Only people who live there. Or people who know people, like my boyfriend does. You guys need to meet him. He'll be here in a minute.

PAUL	Mmm.

LUCY	You know what? I want some more wine. In fact, I'll take an I.V. of it.

PAUL	Noted.

NESSA	Two I.V.'s.

PAUL	Nessa, you've gotta slow your roll, love.

MORGANA	Um, why are you guys here, again?

NESSA	Paul, he's doing the panel thing.

LUCY	Yeah, because he has actual things to say. Sorry. Um, there is a designer on the panel and Paul wants to ask her out.

NESSA	He makes us act like we're interested in him so he can, like, get girls.

PAUL	Yeah, it's legitimizing. Once I make partner I probably won't need it.

MORGANA	He's right. My boyfriend's a partner. It's attractive. I mean, my boyfriend's already attractive. My boyfriend. My boyfriend. My boyfriend. My boyfriend. My boyfriend. My boyfriend. My boyfriend. My boyfriend.

LUCY	Maybe you should get a shirt that says "I have a boyfriend" and then you wouldn't have to tell us every five seconds.

PAUL	Ok, refill. Coming right up.

MORGANA	I didn't mean to make you jealous.

LUCY	Of what?

NESSA	You know what? This is a good time to go.

LUCY	I'm good.

MORGANA	Oh, there he is.
	
LUCY	Ugh.

HONEY PARKER	(moaning) I'm all out of sausage. I hope you brought your hot, throbbing co-

LUCY	What am I doing?
	
HAL GREGSON	Thank you. We'll be in touch. It's that way.

LUCY	(RECORDING) Hey, Priscilla, it's me. So the audition went great. I did it!
	I finally crossed something big off one of my lists. Ah, I feel amazing.
	
PAUL	Jeff's getting married? And he's inviting you? And this is his idea of a wedding invitation? Talk about no taste.

LUCY	It gets worse.

PAUL	Don't even. He wants you to play at the wedding.

LUCY	Us. Yeah. He wants the quartet.

PAUL	Well, we're not doing that. And I don't even understand, why would he want you to be there at the wedding?

LUCY	Maybe he feels guilty. I don't know, maybe he feels like he's doing me a big favour.

PAUL	How is this a favour?

LUCY	The girl's family is loaded.

PAUL	Ok, so we're absolutely doing it. But Jeff is a tool. And not a sharp one. Do you know, Luce, when uh, when Sharon left me for Jennifer...it was more the rejection that hurt. Not necessarily her leaving.

LUCY	Honestly, I don't really care about Jeff leaving. And who wants to have super lame sex the rest of their life, anyway?

PAUL	Uh, I do. Lame sex, virtual sex, the faint possibility of sex, any of which would be more than I'm currently getting. I can't even get my hand to have sex with me anymore.

LUCY	Yeah, well, maybe if you dressed up your hand like a redhead who cooks, loves musicals, and has a PhD...

PAUL	I'm sad to report that my standards have dropped somewhat significantly.

LUCY	Oh yeah? Well, what is your type these days?

PAUL	Willing.

LUCY	(laughs)

PAUL	And I've got to go to Vegas for a bachelor party. I swear, all those boobs I can't touch might just be the end of me.

LUCY	Yeah, I'm pretty sure no one over the age of two has ever died from lack of boob.

PAUL	That's a valid point.

LUCY	Wait a second, when are you leaving?

PAUL	For Vegas?

LUCY	Yeah.

PAUL	Tomorrow, why?

LUCY	Because I need to finish my list and there's this Vegas thing on there.

PAUL	No, no, no, you need to finish it because Jeff's getting married.

LUCY	No, I-

PAUL	Besides, Grant's gonna be there.

LUCY	I don't care if Grant's gonna be there. I just need to finish my list, alright?
	And you're gonna help me.

PAUL	So just embarrassing me at the strip club wasn't enough for you, was it?

LUCY	This'll be so much better.

PAUL	Will it be, though?

LUCY	Yeah.

PAUL	Could I get more needles in here, please? Tensing up!

MUSIC	It's Saturday night and the feeling's alright, The start of a lovely affair,  Let's get on with the dancing,  Flirting and romancing, What a wonderful night we can share,  They're selling kisses at the bar,  Drinks and cigars,  Music is filling the air,  Let's sing another song, Keep dancing all night long, We're swinging on a Saturday night, We're swinging and singing tonight 

LUCY	You need to have sex. And I have to finish my list. So it's a win-win.

PAUL	Um, for losers. So I'm not sure we come out on the right side of this.

LUCY	Ok. Here is who's working today.

PAUL	Nope. Can't do it. Do you know what? They're probably all diseased.

LUCY	No, you're more likely to catch something in a sorority house. See?
	Here is a whole information sheet about their weekly tests, how they check each customer for symptoms, and clean everyone's genitals with anti-bacterial-

PAUL	How about we don't use the word "genitals"?

LUCY	Will you please just go in there and do the deed so you can report back?

PAUL	Why don't you just go inside and do the deed and report back?

LUCY	Because they don't service lesbians or straight girls who like sex with women.

PAUL	How do you know they don't service women? Oh my god, you called and asked for yourself. Wow, you really have turned over a new leaf.

LUCY	Look, you buy women nice dinners all the time hoping to get sex out of it, correct?

PAUL	What? Pfff. I- I do.

LUCY	Yeah. So that's just a more honest side of the exact same coin, and it's perfectly natural.

PAUL	I'm not going in there alone.

LUCY	Well, great. Let's get in there.

PAUL	Wow. Called my bluff. Oh boy, this is happening. (southern accent) Hey, sweetheart. You worry too much. I told you there'd be other normal people here. Howdy, fellas. How y'all doin' today? We're here to get her some, if you know what I mean. Ain't that right, honey bunch? It's a perfectly natural thing.

LUCY	What dialect is that?

PAUL	Is it not southern?

LUCY	Not at all. And just to be clear, this is already not worth it.

PAUL	So we are clear, am I to share your girl or get my own? I mean, we've not really worked out any of the details here. Oh. Interesting.

CAROLINE	Ladies? Please say hello.

PAUL	Just like that, here they come, down the staircase.

LUCY	Oh, that's a nice dress.

MAX	Thank you.

PAUL	I need to go to the bathroom. Uh... I can't do this. I'm so, so sorry. May I squeeze through? Good luck.

VICTOR	What happened to your boyfriend?

LUCY	Oh, no, he's not my boyfriend. He's more of a colleague.

CAROLINE	Excuse me, doll? We don't service single women here.

LUCY	Actually, I want to apply for a job.

CAROLINE	As...?

LUCY	As a... you know, what they are. Do. Hi.

CAROLINE	You want to be a working girl.

LUCY	Yeah.

CAROLINE	(chuckles)

LUCY	Wow.

PAUL	How'd it go?

LUCY	Well, I applied to be one of the girls.

PAUL	I'm sorry, what?

LUCY	Well, I didn't get the job, obviously.

PAUL	So quick question. When I tell the story later, which do you think is going to be better? The fact that you applied to be a prostitute or that you didn't get the job?

LUCY	Anyway, I'm really sorry that you're late for your bachelor party.

PAUL	No, that's alright.  I'll just tell them the truth, that you got hung up at a job interview. I'm just teasing. They'd be lucky to have you.

LUCY	Thank you.
	
PAUL	Here we are, huh? Well, I mean, are you sure you don't wanna come along?
	You can always be the entertainment package.

LUCY	No, I'm just gonna wander around.

PAUL	Alright.

LUCY	All I want right now is a quiet bar and an artfully crafted cocktail.

PAUL	Fair enough.

LUCY	Have fun!

PAUL	Alright, have a good night!

LUCY	Woooo! Yes! Ooh, that's strong. Let's take a picture. My new friends. One, two, three.

GUITARIST	Alright, Vegas. Welcome to karaoke night at the Blue Saloon. Up next we've got... Lucy Nell. Come on up.

LUCY	What? Oh, no. No, I didn't sign up.

GUITARIST	Well, someone put your name in there.

LUCY	Well... actually, I don't sing.

GUITARIST	What do you do, then?

LUCY	Um... I'm a violinist?

GUITARIST	Oh. Well then why don't you come down and play some violin for us?

LUCY	Oh, no, no, no. No, I'm good. Thank you.

GUITARIST	Come on, there's only like five people in here. What've you got to lose? Get up here, have some fun.

LUCY	Crap. Ok. Not cool, guys.

GUITARIST	Give it up for Lucy.

HARVARD GRADS	(cheering)

LUCY	I play classical mostly.

GUITARIST	Don't worry about it. Just play along. We're in the key of G. It's an original.
	There's your bow. Are you guys ready? Hello my lovely baby, I want you near,  I see you walking through my door, And it is clear, I need you more and more, don't I?

Alright, Lucy! Yeah. Well done. Alright, let's see who's up next. Anyone else have any hidden talents out there?

LUCY	What're you doing here? Shouldn't you be at the bachelor party with Paul?

GRANT	Paul showed me the picture you texted him of you and the posse of Harvard boys. I recognized the bar so-

LUCY	What, so you-

GRANT	Thought I'd come looking for you.

LUCY	Please tell me you've got better than that.

GRANT	How about I tell you how sorry I am that I fell off the face of the earth?
	I was an idiot.

LUCY	Why didn't you call?

GRANT	A bunch of reasons. None of them good.

LUCY	Ok, look. This has been fun and thank you for whatever this is but I am not-

GRANT	But- but wait. Can I just have one second? Meeting you was a big surprise.
	And then I realized how much I really liked you. But then I- I just-

LUCY	Decided to show your considerable appreciation by sleeping with me and then running out?

GRANT	It's just- it's a scary proposition.

LUCY	What's scary? I'm scary? What is scary about me?

GRANT	For starters, you're obsessed with sex.

LUCY	Look, you came around at a really weird time. And I know the list is bizarre
	but I've got something important to prove.

GRANT	Prove what? To who?

LUCY	To myself. I guess... I need to prove to myself that I'm enough.

GRANT	Leaving like that was a mistake. Not calling you was a mistake. Will you please forgive me?

LUCY	Sorry.

GRANT	Woah, woah, woah. Wait. Wait. Stop.

LUCY	Stop?

GRANT	I don't wanna hurt the baby.

LUCY	What? Um... I'm not pregnant.

GRANT	I beg your pardon?

LUCY	Wait-

GRANT	You're not?

LUCY	I know- I know I've been emotional and like I'm craving some weird stuff, but oh my- oh my god, do I look pregnant?

GRANT	No, no, no. You're not emotional. You look stunning and beautiful. It's uh, at your house you had maternity pants on the chair. Honestly, I saw the pants and I freaked out and that's why I left.

LUCY	Oh my god.

GRANT	What?

LUCY	Oh my god. You left because you thought I was pregnant?

GRANT	It's a scary proposition.

LUCY AND GRANT	(laughing)

LUCY	Wow. Wait. You thought that and you still wanted to be with me.

GRANT	We like the same books.

LUCY	Mmm. Not in the same order.

GRANT	You're right. It's never gonna work.

PAUL	(RECORDING)Luce, it's Paul. You're never gonna believe this. I've met the girl of my dreams. Her name is Destiny and yes, she is a stripper. Let me tell you...

HAL GREGSON	(RECORDING)Hi Lucy, Howard Gregson. Our committee loved your audition but ultimately decided your playing is too expansive. A hair uninhibited for our conductor. But I think your skills are just a bit misplaced. To that end I have an opportunity coming up in a couple of weeks.

LUCY	Hey.

GRANT	Hey.

LUCY	You all ready for the wedding?

GRANT	Yes, but there's something we need to do first.
	
LUCY	Wow.

GRANT	Well, you've still got one more thing on your list.

LUCY	Oh. Yes I do. Let's go.
	
HONEY PARKER	There you go. Thank you guys so much. Thank you.

GRANT	Hi

HONEY PARKER	Hi. Hey. Who can I make it out to?

GRANT	Uh, Lucy. Yeah, she's a big fan.

HONEY PARKER	Um, how do I spell that?

LUCY	Actually, there's a much bigger fan that you should make this out to. I mean, this is just so Jeff.

GRANT	Care to dance?

LUCY	Yes, I would love to.
	
NESSA	Ok, Stan. Woo!

JEFF	Hey, there she is. Here, come on. Switch.

LUCY	Oh. Hey, congratulations.

ANNE	Oh, thanks. And thanks for playing for us. The force is strong with you.

JEFF	(laughing) Mind if I...? That's cool. Thanks for doing this.

LUCY	The price was right.

JEFF	Is that the only reason?

LUCY	No. Well, maybe. Ok, yes. It was. But...

JEFF	Ok.

LUCY	I'm glad I did. I'm glad we're good.

JEFF	Me too. Uh, I gotta ask you. Um, whatever happened to that list you had?
	The interesting one?

LUCY	Wait until you see the wedding gift I got for you.
	
JEFF	I can't find it.

HONEY PARKER	That's because it's right here. And I can't wait to give it to you.

JEFF	I'm... married. I'm- I got married. I'm married today.

LUCY	Thank you so much for doing this.

HONEY PARKER	What can I say? I believe in love.

PAUL	 Hey, Luce, all the bridesmaids are twerking   on the dance floor... hi.  I'm Paul.

HONEY PARKER	I'm Honey.

PAUL	Delighted.

HONEY PARKER	Are you gonna ask me to dance?

PAUL	Yes, yes I am. Right this way, please.

LUCY	(exhales)
