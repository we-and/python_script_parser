AUDREY 	There’s a narrow ledge, okay? So lift your foot. 

MARK 	(grunts)

AUDREY 	Wait for me. Okay, you got it. 

SARGE	Shit.

AUDREY 	Okay, ready?

SARGE 	Let’s go. 

AUDREY 	Mark! 

SUA 	(speaks in Laotian)

KANYA 	(grunts) 

SUA 	Kanya! Kanya! Kanya! 

KANYA 	(grunts) (breathes heavily) (speaks in Laotian)

SARGE	(grunts)

AUDREY 	Hey.

MARK 	Take the baby. Take the baby. 

AUDREY 	Okay. It’s okay. 

SARGE 	(overlapping) (groans) 

MARK 	C’mon, big man. (grunts) That’s okay. Come on. Come on. I got you. (grunts) Okay. All right, I got you, man. 

SARGE 	(gasps)

MARK 	You made it, brother. You made it, brother. (to Kanya) No. 

KANYA 	What…

MARK 	No, no.

KANYA	(speaks Laotian) 

MARK 	No, no, no! No, no, no, no. 

AUDREY 	Please, please.

MARK 	Okay, he’s hurt. He’s hurt. 

AUDREY 	(overlapping) Please.

MARK 	All right?

SARGE 	Please. Help. 

SUA 	Do exactly as I say. Or we leave you here. Move.

MARK 	Yeah. 

AUDREY 	(softly) Okay. 

KANYA	(speaks Laotian) 

AUDREY 	(to baby) It’s okay. Hey? Excuse me? The baby needs dry clothes.

KANYA 	Hurry up. 

MARK 	(to baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

AUDREY 	I'm gonna change her. 

MARK 	Okay.

AUDREY 	(to baby) Shh-shh-shh. It’s okay. 

MARK 	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! 

SUA 	Let her go. 

MARK 	All right. All right. All right. All right.

SUA 	Police. I should have fuckin’ guessed.

MARK 	Golden Triangle. I already knew. We’re good.

AUDREY 	Okay, what the hell does that mean?

MARK 	Nothing. Now just get the baby, just get-- 

KANYA 	(speaks in Laotian) 

AUDREY 	(overlapping) Look out! 

MARK 	Mother fucker.

SUA 	C’mon, you little boy. 

MARK 	Come on. Come on.

SUA 	(coughs)

MARK 	Come on.

SUA 	Come on. Come on.

AUDREY 	(strained voice) Mark! Mark. (gasps) 

KANYA 	Sua!

AUDREY 	(gasps)

KANYA 	(to Audrey) Shh. Shh.

SUA 	(grunts)

AUDREY 	The baby. (grunts…) 

MARK 	Who are they? Warlords? Militia? (breathes heavily) 

SUA 	Worse. Police. Since the aliens came, they’ve been on the warpath. They take everything. The women, too. We need to get out of this valley. 

MARK 	Look, I’ll help you. You, you get that baby to a doctor, yeah? (breathes heavily…)

SUA	(grunts)

MARK 	(whispers) Fuck. 

KANYA 	Oy! 

SUA 	Minefield. No shortcuts in Lao. 

AUDREY 	She needs to rest. 

SUA 	We camp here.

MARK 	When I was up on that ship, I only saw one real alien. All the rest were just slaves. 

KANYA 	Bullshit. 

MARK 	You love your brother, right? No matter what?

KANYA 	No matter what.

MARK 	Well, these things are still human up here. Our family, our friends, our brothers. If one of ‘em can be freed, they all can be freed. It’s not bullshit. 

AUDREY 	What was her name? I- I'm so sorry. Sorry. 

MARK 	(overlapping) No. How’s the kid?

AUDREY 	Uh, she- she’s still growing, Mark.

MARK 	Yeah, I know.

AUDREY 	I mean, what, you think they can help? 

MARK 	You got a better plan let me know. 

AUDREY 	Right, okay. 

MARK 	Rose. My wife’s name was Rose. 

AUDREY 	That’s a classic. 

MARK 	She was. 

THE CHIEF 	Shh.

THE CHIEF 	(speaks in Laotian)

KANYA 	(gasps)

THE CHIEF 	(speaks in Laotian) 

MARK 	What?

THE CHIEF 	(speaks in Laotian) 

MARK 	I don’t know what you’re sayin’. 

THE CHIEF 	(speaks in Laotian) 

MARK 	I don’t know what you’re sayin’. 

THE CHIEF 	(yells) (speaks in Laotian)

MARK 	(overlapping) (yells) I don’t know what-- 

THE CHIEF	(grunts) 

SUA 	(breathes heavily)

AUDREY 	Hey! Hey, hey, no, it’s okay. He’s down. He’s wounded. He can’t- he can’t hurt you. We’ll take him with us, so please, please…

THE CHIEF 	(overlapping) (grunts)

AUDREY 	Hey. Hey, hey, hey. It’s okay. Okay? Okay, come here. 

KANYA 	(speaks Laotian) 

SUA	(speaks Laotian) 

KANYA	(speaks Laotian) 

AUDREY 	It’s beautiful. 

KANYA 	(speaks in Laotian) A thousand years ago, we built this to honor the gods. Now, we use it to fight them. 

MARK 	Jesus Christ. I hope they have room service. Fuckin’ Temple of Doom. 

KANYA
	(speaks Laotian) 
HARPER 	Harper.

MARK 	Mark.

HARPER 	Nice to meet you.

MARK 	What is this place?

HARPER 	Home. How’s it up there?

MARK 	Not good.

HARPER 	(chuckles lightly) Yeah, it’s pretty fucked, right?

THE CHIEF 	(grunts) (breathes heavily…)

HARPER 	She’s got an extremely high temperature. What is she, three years old?

MARK 	Try two days.

AUDREY 	Yeah. They don’t cover this at med school, huh? 

HARPER 	Actually, love, I'm a scientist. 

MARK 	Lemme guess, a chemist by trade.

HARPER 	Well, it pays better than the CDC. Plus, you really can’t beat the benefits. 

SUA 	(to Mark) We need to talk. Tell me about the girl. 

MARK 	What you see in there, that’s what I know. That’s it. 

SUA 	You think I care you’re police? You think that matters now? 

MARK 	Some shit matters. You hear me? Some shit still matters, like who I can trust. I can’t trust that guy. Drug runners aren’t real high on my list. 

SUA 	As soon as Americans stop buying… we stop making.  

MARK 	Well, I guess the apocalypse wasn’t a total loss then, was it?

SUA 	Apocalypse. Yeah, that’s funny. Look around. When do you think this place was built? Forty years ago you bombed us. You tried to destroy us. But we survived the American apocalypse. (sighs) We’ll survive this one, too. 

KANYA 	I’ve got a present for you. 

HARPER	I’ve never seen anything quite like this.

KANYA 	Mm-hmm.

HARPER	Something changed her DNA.

KANYA 	Change how?

HARPER	I don’t know if she’s human. Fuck me.

AUDREY 	Hey, hey. Hey! 

KANYA 	She’s not welcome here!

SUA 	Kanya! Hey, Kanya! 

MARK 	(overlapping) Hey, hey, hey! 

SUA 	(overlapping) Stop, stop. Stop! 

MARK	(overlapping) Enough! Enough! Enough!

SUA 	(overlapping) No, no, no, no, no! Stop!

MARK 	(overlapping) Enough, enough! 

KANYA 	Alien! 

MARK 	No alien! 

AUDREY 	No!

MARK 	Enough!

KANYA 	(breathes heavily) 

MARK 	Listen to me. When I was on that ship, I saw them... doing experiments on our unborn children. Dissecting them. Unborn babies. (breathes heavily) When women see that light something happens. The babies grow fast. Most of them die. (breathes heavily) She lived. This child can be the key to freeing the others. Do you understand me? Hope. She’s our hope! 

HARPER	Now, I’ve got good news and bad. Her cell walls are denser, almost like a shielding. Her blood is… nothing short of extraordinary. 

MARK 	Yeah, right. Okay, good. What’s the bad news?

HARPER	She’s running out. The constant growth has just depleted her entire system and she’s shutting down. She needs a transfusion. 

AUDREY 	Oka- okay, but she’s- she’s not human. How can we match her blood type? 

HARPER	I'm not gonna lie. Odds are we can’t. 

MARK 	Hey! What about me? I was weaponized. 

HARPER 	(sighs deeply) 

MARK 	How ya doin’ there, kiddo?

3-YEAR-OLD ROSE	Hey.

MARK 	(chuckles lightly) 

HARPER	Well, I’ll be damned. 

MARK 	Yeah. 

HARPER 	So, this is actually a bullet and this blue shit is what fuels their light weapons, mind control, all of it. 

SUA	Can you make a vaccine?

HARPER 	Well, it’s not actually a virus. It behaves like bacteria, a virus, a sentient being, the whole gamut. Scientifically speaking, it’s, uh… completely bloody alien. 

AUDREY 	(chuckles)

HARPER 	Except… it’s biologically compatible with our DNA. Do you realize how unlikely that is?

AUDREY 	They’ve been here before. 

HARPER 	I’ll go one further. They might have put us here… planted us like a crop. And every couple of millennia they come back to harvest. 

MARK 	Huh. (to Sua) You sure he’s not doin’ the drugs?

AUDREY 	(chuckles) 

HARPER 	But… they weren’t counting on one thing. Evolution. Her serum blocks it. So, we load one of their bullets with her blood into the right delivery system, we can free them all.

MARK 	We need to use one of their cannons. You are not fuckin’ around. 

AUDREY 	Wow. Okay. 

MARK 	(chuckles) Huh? 

AUDREY 	Are you compensating for something?

MARK 	Too big? 

SUA	(chuckles lightly) Kanya, go rig the hillside. Take her with you.

AUDREY 	Okay.

KANYA 	‘Kay.

HARPER 	This is all we’ll have for the next twenty-four hours.

SUA	We leave at nightfall.

KANYA 	(hums…)

AUDREY 	Fights. Guns. Bombs. Yeah, you’re really good for my health. Hey, thanks. 

KANYA 	Stay here. 

SUA 	(on radio) Kanya. I said-- 

KANYA 	(exhales)

SUA 	(on radio) Kanya, come in. Kanya? 

AUDREY 	(shrieks) Ah! (grunts) 

SUA 	(on radio) Kanya!

KANYA 	Duck! 

SUA 	(on radio) Kanya!

HARPER 	What? What’s wrong? What?

KANYA 	(pants) (grunts) 

SUA	The minefield! 

HARPER	Oh my God.

KANYA 	(grunts…) Ah! 

HARPER	Oh! 

KANYA 	(speaks in Laotian)

HARPER 	Run, baby, run. Run. Run! Whoa, wait, what is she doing? Run! 

KANYA 	(speaks Laotian) 

HARPER	What?

KANYA 	(on radio) (speaks Laotian) 

SUA 	(on radio) No, No, Kanya, please. Please.

HARPER 	(voice breaks) Fuck. 

AUDREY 	(breathes shakily) 

HARPER 	(voice breaks) Fuck. (exhales shakily) 

AUDREY 	(exhales) Oh, shit. 

MARK 	(grunts) Hey, you okay? 

AUDREY 	(breathes shakily) (gasps) 

MARK 	All right, all right, all right, all right.  

AUDREY 	(breathes shakily) (softly) Oh my God. 

MARK 	Okay. Breathe. You’re good. (to Sua) Hey, we gotta leave. 

SUA	No. We defend these tunnels every day.

MARK 	Don’t move. (to Sua) Hey! How much time can you give me? 

SUA 	Not a lot.

MARK 	I need that syringe. I'm goin’ after the cannon. 

SUA 	You’ll never make it. 

MARK 	They’re still human inside.

SUA	No! They’re death. It’s us or them.

MARK 	One of them is my son. Yeah, it’s crazy. I need the syringe. 

SUA	(sighs) Fuckin’ Americans. 

MARK 	I'm gonna get you to someplace safe, huh? Make sure nothin’ happens to you. Because I made a promise. 

MARK	Yeah. You know what that means? That means that no matter what happens, I'm not gonna let anything hurt you.

3-YEAR-OLD ROSE	Promise?

MARK 	Yeah, kid. I promise. 

AUDREY 	Mark, you are not going out there alone.

MARK 	There’s no time for this. We don’t have time. 

AUDREY 	(overlapping) Come on. We need to talk about this now. 

MARK 	Listen, we both know this is a one-way trip. 

AUDREY 	(overlapping) Please! (softly) Please! 

MARK 	You are all she has left. 

AUDREY 	You’re the parent, Mark. Not me. 

MARK 	Come on.

AUDREY 	(exhales) I'm so sorry your family is gone, but killing yourself is not gonna change that. 

MARK 	(softly) I gotta go.

SUA 	(on radio) Be ready.

MAN #1	(on radio) Ready. 

SUA 	(on radio) They’re in. Hold.  Hold. Now!  Move back. Move back! Give it to me. Come on. 

GUARD #1 	(yells) 

GUARD #2	(grunts) (screams) Ah! 

GUARD #3 	(yells) Ah…! (grunts) 

SUA 	(grunts) Oh fuck! (grunts…) (speaks Laotian) 

MARK	(whispers) All right  (grunts)

SUA 	Take it. Take it. Come on. 

MARK 	(breathes heavily…) 

AUDREY 	(hums…) Harper. 

HARPER 	Apologies love. I'm, uh, I'm not a warrior. I'm, uh, I'm a survivor.

AUDREY 	Yeah. I used to think that was enough. (exhales) 

SUA 	(speaks in Laotian)

AUDREY 	(gasps) Keep your eyes closed. 

MARK 	(grunts) 

GUARD #4 	(speaks in Laotian) 

SUA	Run, run, run. Come on. 

HARPER	Come on. 

MARK	(grunts…) Trent? Trent! Trent, don’t! (grunts) (grunts) 

HARPER 	(yells) Audrey! Ah! Ah! (grunts…) 

AUDREY 	Oh! (grunts)

MARK 	(breathes heavily)

TRENT 	(yells) Dad…! Dad! Dad! 

MARK 	Ah! (grunts) (breathes heavily) (grunts) 

AUDREY 	(yells) Ah…! Ah…! Ah… (gasps)

MARK 	(softly) Oh, shit.

AUDREY	Oh my God. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey!

MARK 	It’s Trent. There. All you. Here, here, here! (grunts) Fight, Trent! Fight! 

AUDREY 	(gasps) No!

THE CHIEF	(grunts…) 

WOMAN 	(speaks in Laotian) 

THE CHIEF 	(grunts…) Ah…! (grunts) 

SUA 	(grunts…) Fuckin’ aliens.

AUDREY 	Ya! Ya! 

MARK 	Get outta the way, kid! Look out! 

AUDREY 	(exhales) Hey. Hey. 

3-YEAR-OLD ROSE 	(overlapping) (giggles) 

SUA 	I told you we would survive. 

MARK 	Survive? We did a hell of a lot more than survive, my friend. We evolved. (to Audrey) We have a name for this little one? 

AUDREY 	How about… Rose? 

MARK 	Yeah. Rose. 

ROSE 	And that’s my name. Classic, huh? 

SOLDIER	Captain on deck! 

ROSE	At ease, guys. That was the day we found their weakness. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Trent. I was a little busy.And our strength. How about next time I drive… you get stabbed. Now, we’re not just fighting back. We’re taking the fight to them. Ready? Promise? 

MARK 	Whoa!

TRENT AS ALIEN 	Fuck.

MARK 	(grunts) 

MAN #2 	(laughs) 

AUDREY 	(laughs) 

MARK 	What are you doin’ here?

HARPER 	Just acting and shit. 

MAN #3 	(laughs) 

SARGE 	I gotta take a piss. It ain’t funny. 

THE CHIEF 	Ah! 

GARCIA	I'm an arm or two shorter, bro. 

AUDREY 	(yells) Bring it on…! (laughs) 

SUA 	(grunts) 

MAN #4 	(grunts) Yeah, I can see. 

MARK 	Let’s get together after this.

SUA 	All right. 

MARK 	Thank you.

SUA 	I’ll see you on the next project.

MARK 	Yeah. Thank you. 

SUA 	(overlapping) Okay. You, too.

AUDREY 	You guys are--

MARK 	You’re the stupidest fuckin’ monster I’ve ever seen in my life. 

MAN #5	(laughs) Fuck off. 

MARK 	I'm just sayin’. You’re gonna blow us up. (laughs)
