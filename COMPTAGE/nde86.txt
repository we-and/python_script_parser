CATHY WINSLOW	[Mom] I should hopefully see you guys after school. As long as they don't make me work a double again.
 
MAX WINSLOW	So we just gave up on the idea of Dad sending money ever again?

CATHY WINSLOW	We don't need money from your father.

MAX WINSLOW	You know there's this thing called karma. One day it's gonna catch up to him. I'm just gonna laugh in his face.  Seriously mom, just give me 10 minutes and I can hack into this credit card's website and make the late fee disappear.

CATHY WINSLOW 	I know you can. But sweety, that's called stealing.

MAX WINSLOW	Yeah, they're stealing from us.

CATHY WINSLOW	Your brother's gonna freeze to death outside.  Now go!

MAX WINSLOW	Okay!
 
MAX WINSLOW	Get up, sparky.

ETHAN WINSLOW 	What took you so long?

MAX WINSLOW	Oh, nothing. I was just hacking into all the smart doorbell systems in the neighborhood.

ETHAN WINSLOW	I have so many questions. But mainly just why?

MAX WINSLOW	Okay, check it out.

MAX WINSLOW	Okay.

ETHAN WINSLOW	[Brother] Wow.

MAX WINSLOW	Mhmm.

ETHAN WINSLOW 	And you wonder why you have no friends.

MAX WINSLOW	And no cares in the world, Ethan.
 
PARENT		All right, well I'll be right here to pick you up this week.

STUDENT		Okay, dad, love you.

PARENT		I love you too.

SOPHIA PEACH	Move your hand. No, the other hand.

SOPHIA'S MOTHER	Oh, like this?

SOPHIA		No mom, I'm trying to see the fancy dashboard.

SOPHIA'S MOTHER	Oh, sorry, I thought you wanted me in it.

SOPHIA		Hmm, very funny, mom.  Hmm, perfect. We should get like 20,000 likes before lunch. French fries.

SOPHIA'S MOTHER	I am so proud of you, honey. Potatoes. (giggling) French fries.

SOPHIA		Bye, mom. Hey, watch it, freak!

AIDEN			Oh, look, I'm internet famous. Move!

MAX WINSLOW 	Hey!

AIDEN			What?
 
MAX WINSLOW 	Don't!
 
AIDEN			Back off.

ETHAN WINSLOW	You think we're doomed as a species?

MAX WINSLOW	What, I'm sorry, what were you talking about?

ETHAN WINSLOW 	I said, don't you think Connor Lawson's a little out of your league?

MAX WINSLOW	What? Dude, what are you? God, you're so annoying!
 
GYM TEACHER 	I know, it must feel very weird for you to be moving your legs around so much. But that's called jogging. And that weird shiny stuff? It's called sweat! Stretch it out. What are you doing on the bench?

BENNY		What are you talking about, playa?

GYM TEACHER	Benny, we talked about this. You can't call me play anymore. What's wrong with you this week?
 
BENNY		Tendinitis. I got a note from my mom.

GYM TEACHER	How many hours of Fortify do you play every day?

BENNY		Enough to be the best.

GYM TEACHER	Enough to give you tendinitis?

BENNY	Let's just say, enough to get a note from my mom so I don't have to jog and sweat around the gym, playa. Playa, playa.
 
SOPHIA		And I have found to no surprise that the future of me is in my posts, my thoughts, and in my eyes. Thank you.

ENGLISH TEACHER	Now, now, that was an interesting choice for a poem, Sophia.

SOPHIA		It was called Sophia.

ENGLISH TEACHER	And it was very clear, thank you, Sophia. Max Winslow, you're up.

MAX 			So anyway. Here's my poem.

ENGLISH TEACHER	Well Max, that's not a poem. It's... That's just gibberish.

MAX			It's a firewall code.

ENGLISH TEACHER	[Teacher] A what code?

MAX		A firewall code. A firewall code. And in my opinion, it's better than a poem cause it serves an actual purpose. This one keeps bad things out. So if you delete any of|the letters or numbers in the code, then the|whole thing falls apart. Now it doesn't work unless everything works together. So, you know, I think that's pretty poetic.

ATTICUS VIRTUE	Hello, students of Bentonville High School. I'm Atticus Virtue, but I'm guessing you already know that. As many of you know, I constructed the Virtue Manor in 2009 in order to conduct some very cutting edge experiments. My goal has always been to build a better tomorrow. To bring the future into the present. Well, I am pleased to announce that my experiments have been success. That's right. Long before my little startup turned into the billion-dollar tech company it is today, I grew up in Northwest Arkansas. I am proud of my humble roots. I am proud to have attended the same high school that you are all sitting at today. And that is why I wanna give back to my community. So I am conducting one final experimental competition. Exactly five students will be chosen to be invited to my home here. Those five students will compete in a game. The winner of that game will get the key to my manor. It is really that simple. So, the school bell will ring at three p.m. At 3:16 on the dot you will all receive a text. Five of you will be chosen, got it? It's Latin. Good luck.
 
 MALE STUDENT 	Yeah that dude's like a total hermit now.
FEM STUDENT #1	Yeah but he's worth 32 billion. 

FEM STUDENT #2 	I would die if I got to go to that thing.

CONNER LAWSON 	No way, I got invited!

MALE FRIEND #1	No, you didn't, no you didn't.

MALE FRIEND #2	Please bro, no way.

SOPHIA 		(exclaiming) Oh my gosh. My Instagram followers are gonna love this. I could do a live stream. I have to tell my mother.
 
 BENNY		Yes? No! What is this?
 
SOPHIA	 	Mom, you are not gonna believe what just happened to me.
  
ETHAN 		Wait, Maxine! Sorry, I mean Max. Did you see this thing?

MAX 			Yeah, I did, obviously.

ETHAN		So I guess, you got a no then too?

MAX			I didn't even look at it.

ETHAN		You didn't even check your phone?

MAX		There are 3,000 kids in that high school. Only five are getting chosen. Do you even know what those odds are? No, stop trying to do the math in your head. It's a .167 percent chance.
 
ETHAN		Did you really just do that math in your head? Is that common core?

MAX		Listen, Ethan. Do I wanna go to Atticus Virtue's mansion? Of course, I do.

ETHAN 		Here, just let me look for you.

MAX 			Okay.

MAX			If it'll make you stop.

ETHAN 		No.

MAX			See?

ETHAN		Way!

MAX 			What?
 ETHAN		No way!
 
ETHAN		You got invited to Atticus Virtue's weird mansion party thing!

MAX 			No way. Oh, dude! Dude, yes! Come on!
 
ANCHORMAN	He's launched rockets into space, redefined artificial intelligence and now eccentric billionaire Atticus Virtue takes on his next project!

ANCHORWOMAN	Nice.

ANCHORMAN	A competition for high school students.

ANCHORWOMAN	Oh, that's right, Jason. But no one knows much about the Virtue estate. But apparently one lucky student gets to keep it?

ANCHORMAN	Yeah! Hey, I'm a student. I graduated Bentonville class of 97. Where's my invite? What, did you? - Neither did I, no!

ANCHORWOMAN	You didn't get one. What, did you?- Neither did I, no!

CATHY		[Mom] Okay, wait a minute. How does a school just let him take over the whole TV system?

ETHAN		Reason number one, because he bought the school  a 40 million dollar athletic facility?

CATHY		Well I know that.

MAX			Mom, Atticus Virtue is one of the most brilliant minds of our time.

CATHY		I know that too. It's weird though, right?  It's a little bit of an unknown.

ETHAN 		The world is an unknown. The internet is the Wild West. And parents just send us online willy nilly every day. You know, this competition could change our lives, ladies! It's game time! Let's go.

CATHY 		Why are you so riled up? Did you drink coffee again?

ETHAN		It was decaf.

CATHY		What do you really want me to say to you right now?
 
MAX 		I want you to say that I got this? That maybe there was a reason I was chosen?
 

ETHAN		Max is like Neo from the Matrix. Except she's from the Arkansas.
 
CATHY		Okay, you need to stop talking so much.
 
MAX		Mom, I have a one in five chance of winning a mansion. We would be insane not to give it a try. I mean, look at us here.
 
ETHAN		Yeah, I mean look at us here!
 
MAX			Okay.
 
CATHY		[Mom] You seriously have to stop drinking coffee.
 
ETHAN		It's decaf.
 
CATHY 		And you have to text me every hour.
 
MAX			Okay.
 
CONNER SONG	? Don't have to question my love ? ? Picking petals off of flowers? ? Girl I want you ?
 
TAMMY LAWSON	They sent it overnight. That's when you know you're important.
 
CONNER 		Did you already open it?
 
TAMMY		I maybe peeked a little bit.
 
WADE LAWSON	[Dad] Doesn't change what's inside.
 
TAMMY		[Mom] Full ride.
 
WADE LAWSON	[Dad] That's right. Con man's going Ivy League, baby.
 
TAMMY		Hold this for a second.
 
WADE LAWSON	[Dad] Oh, wait. Yeah.
 
TAMMY		Not you, honey.
 
WADE			Right then.
 
TAMMY		And get that guitar out the frame.
 
WADE			Got it. Stay with you.

SOPHIA		I bet I get like 2,000|new followers tonight.
 
CONNER		Is that all you care about?
SOPHIA	Pretty much. Hey you know, you should really cash in on your popularity too.
 
CONNER		It's not really my thing.
 
AIDEN			Oh, we get it. Blackspur is too cool for social media.
 
BENNY		Yeah I once went 38 hours straight without stopping play. You guys think they have VR games in there?
 
CONNER		I mean the mansion's supposed to be super tech'd out. I mean I heard they got a private drone, a robotic butler.
 
AIDEN	I heard that they used to do experiments on humans up there. You guys don't know about this? There's a whole reddit thread about how the mansion has a brain. And anyone who enters, it gets inside of your brain and messes you up.
 
MAX		Yeah that thread also mentions that the mansion has|64 yottabytes of memory which I think is like really cool.
 
SOPHIA 		What is a yottabyte?
 
MAX		Gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte, exabyte, zettabyte, yottabyte. It's a one with 24 zeroes behind it. It's like the T-Rex of memory.
 
AIDEN			Did it hurt?
 
MAX			What?
 
AIDEN			When you tripped out of the nerd store.
 
CONNER		Dude.
 
AIDEN		What? She doesn't care. Look at her. Sorry, but you guys aren't my friends. As soon as we get to this place, we're enemies. Only one of us is getting that key tonight. Don't forget it.
 
BENNY		Well. Let's go ring the doorbell.

AIDEN			Yo, we're here! Open up.

CONNER		Hello?
 
BENNY		That was kind of freaky.
 
SOPHIA		Okay guys, I think we're supposed to go inside now. What, don't be all Judge Judy.
 
SOPHIA		Okay guys, we just entered the house.
 
BENNY		Man, these decorations are wack.
 
SOPHIA		Oh.

WOMAN'S VOICE	[Woman] Greetings, Connor, Aiden, Benny, Sophia and Maxine.
 
MAX			Who said that?
 
WOMAN'S VOICE	[Woman] I did.
 
BENNY		Is it just me or does it sound like this dang house is talking?
 
WOMAN'S VOICE	[Woman] It is you, but it is also a house talking. Both statements are factually correct, Benny.
 
MAX			Who are you?
 
WOMAN'S VOICE	[Woman] I am H-A-V-E-N, home automated venture, the house of tomorrow. But you can call me Haven.
 
CONNER		What do you do?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I control everything in the house. Mr. Virtue said in 10 years, every home will have a H.A.V.E.N.
 
MAX			Where is Mr. Virtue?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] He'll be here soon. Are you hungry? I ordered food. It should be here in five, four, three, two,

FOOD DELIVERY	Um, I have an order for Haven?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] You went the wrong way. Had you taken Winchester, you would have missed that construction and been here seven minutes ago.
 
FOOD DELIVERY	Sorry? Sorry?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I should have already had this food placed for my guests. Sir Mordred, get the food from this lady, please.
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] I'll take that. I hope you guys are hungry.
 
AIDEN			Who the heck are you, man?
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] I am Sir Mordred. Mr. Virtue built me while he was in MIT. I am his oldest friend and protector of his manor.
BENNY		Are you like a robot?

MORDRED		[Mordred] Yes. I am an artificial lifeform.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I hope the food is pleasing to your palates.
 
BENNY		Mm, is there like a waitress here? Cause I wouldn't mind some of that rich people mayonnaise. Ayoli.
 
MAX			It's Aioli.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Please hold. We have an incoming call.
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	Well hello there. Hope you're all enjoying the house since it will soon belong to one of you. Wow. Now as you can see I'm not much for decorating. But I almost passed out from blowing up all these balloons so please enjoy them.
 
BENNY		Mr. Virtue, where are you?
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	Currently I am in my jet flying over Tulsa. I had a work emergency but I'm flying back there as we speak. Next question?
 
AIDEN			When does the game start?
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	The game will start when the game starts.
 
AIDEN			Thanks, Captain Obvious.
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	(chuckling) Now. Make sure you save some room for dessert. We have a whole spread in the media room, gummi bears, jelly beans, chocolates, so eat to your heart's content. All right, looks like we're losing our connection here so I'm gonna jump off. I'll see you kids in a flash.
 
BENNY		Hey, he's way more down to earth than I thought.
 
CONNER		The dude just hologrammed himself in from a private jet. That's normal to you?
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] We don't have Aioli.
 
BENNY		This is what I'm talking about.

AIDEN			Fore! Losers. Because that's what I see. Four losers.
 
SOPHIA		Hey Haven, can you project my Instagram onto the big screen?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I certainly can.
SOPHIA	Good, because I've got a new profile pic. So everybody, get ready for me to break the internet.

BENNY		Um, I think you just broke the house.
 
AIDEN			This is the game, guys. It starts now.
 
MAX			Okay, Aiden, maybe don't.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Game one has begun.
 
SOPHIA		Wait, so we just like need the door's passcode or something?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] That is correct. If you get the code wrong three times, the door will stay locked forever.
 
BENNY		Okay. Forever, y'all little computer's got mad jokes.

 HAVEN		[Haven] Strike one.
 
AIDEN			Sophia, what are you doing?
 
SOPHIA		I thought I'd try my phone's passcode first.
 
AIDEN			Why would the passcode for the door be the same as your phone?
 
SOPHIA		Because why wouldn't it be? 
 
BENNY		Your password's 999999?
 
SOPHIA		Okay obviously I need to change that.
 
MAX		Okay, everybody stop. We only have two guesses left. The answer has to be in this room so just look. Oh you guys, I think I got it. Mr. Virtue, he specifically mentioned the candy. That's the clue.  I'll count the jellybeans. You count everything else. Okay, it's 89 jelly beans.
 
BENNY		96 gummies.
 
CONNER		And 76 chocolates.
 
MAX			Are you sure that you counted right?
 
SOPHIA		I mean, Connor's in AP Calculus. I'm pretty sure he can count to 76.
 
BENNY		Well, I'm not in AP anything but I really like gummies, so yeah.
 
MAX			Okay, so then it's 89, 96, 76. Give that a shot.
 HAVEN		[Haven] That's strike two.
 
AIDEN			Great, Mrs. Robot. Have any other amazing ideas?
 
MAX			Guys, I'm sorry, but are you sure that you counted right?
 
CONNER		Yes, I'm positive.
 
MAX			Benny?
 
MAX 			Benny?

BENNY		What?

CONNER		Are you sure that you counted right?
 
BENNY		Okay, maybe I ate two, so what?
 
CONNER		Oh come on, seriously dude?
 
BENNY		What, I'm supposed to not eat gummies sitting right in front of me?
 
MAX			Okay, so you ate two. Then that would make it 89, 98, 76.
 
BENNY		Or maybe I ate three. Okay I definitely ate two or definitely ate three.
 
MAX			It definitely makes a big difference, Benny, so think.
 
AIDEN	The munchkin can't think. Look at him. His brain must be tiny just like his body.
 
BENNY		I just ate two. I swear.
 
MAX			Okay, then it's 89, 98, 76.
 
AIDEN			[Aiden] I'll try.

HAVEN		[Haven] Access granted. Congratulations to Aiden for winning game number one.
 
CONNER		Wait, Aiden? That's not really fair.
 
AIDEN			Why not? I put the numbers in.

HAVEN		[Haven] There are dozens of games all around the house. I'll be keeping tabs all night.  Winner takes all.
 
BENNY		So I guess we won't be needing these anymore. I've taken like 12.
CONNER		That was pretty impressive, what you did back there.
 
MAX			Lucky guess, I guess.

CONNER		You know, I'm not sure we officially met. I'm Connor, by the way. 
 
MAX			I'm aware.
 
CONNER		Hi, Aware. It's very nice to meet you.
 
MAX		Oh, wow. I'm sorry, I'm Max. Short for Maxine as well. I'm aware that you were Conner. I wasn't trying to say that my name is aware, wow, I just need to stop talking now.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Pardon me, but would you like to join the others for a tour of the house?
 
MAX 			Oh, that would be great.
 
HAVEN	[Haven] Game time. How many Instagram followers does Mr. Virtue have?
 
SOPHIA		Oh, 12.4 million.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] That is correct. Where was Mr. Virtue born?
 
MAX 			Poughkeepsie.

CONNER		Poughkeepsie.

HAVEN		[Haven] Who was Sir Mordred?
 
AIDEN			That robotic knight thing?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] That is incorrect. I asked who was Sir Mordred?
 
BENNY		Sir Mordred was one of Sir Arthur's knights. I used to be obsessed with medieval stuff. Mordred's kind of famous for being a traitor.

HAVEN		[Haven] And now for some questions about Mr. Virtue's time in high school.
 
MAX			[Max] Hey Haven, what's down here?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] That is just the basement where Mr. Virtue keeps my motherboard. Think of it as the brains to the house.

MAX			What kind of scanning device is this?

HAVEN		[Haven] That is a breath detector. There is no entry into the basement ever.
 
SOPHIA		Stop.
 
BENNY		What?
 
CONNER		Hey. You're just in time for another little game.
 
BENNY		The answer's giraffe.  I win.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] The answer is not giraffe.
 
BENNY		I was just joking.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] This is a listening game and it starts right now. Name the composer.
 
SOPHIA		Of what?
 
BENNY		Ariana Grande, bam!
 
SOPHIA		(chuckling) You're so stupid, dude.
 
BENNY		What? I was joking, again.
 
CONNER		Chopin. I can't remember his first name, but Chopin.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] (dinging) Very good, Connor. That is correct.
 
SOPHIA		Okay whatever. I don't listen to old people music anyways.
 
BENNY		Where are you going?
 
SOPHIA		To the bathroom! I have to go to the bathroom, okay? Do you have to know every single moment of my life?

BENNY		That's like your thing, right? I bet you in like five minutes you're just gonna take a bunch of pictures of yourself.
 
SOPHIA		You know what, why don't you go play a video game for 50 hours, loser?
 
BENNY 		I'd love to. I like when girls are harsh like that. She kinda reminds me of my mom. Anyway, I'm out too.

MAX			So Chopin, huh?
 
CONNER		Lucky guess, I guess.
MAX			[Max] So I'm thinking there must be a game out here somewhere.
 
CONNER		[Connor] You know I was thinking we should form an alliance.
 
MAX			[Max] An alliance?
 
CONNER		Yeah, cover more ground, a better chance of winning.
 
MAX			All right.
 
CONNER		It's a cool necklace.
 
MAX			Oh, thanks. It's a handy place to keep all my computer codes.
 
CONNER		That's crazy. Where'd you get it?
 
MAX			I don't really wanna talk about where I got it.
 
CONNER		Okay, yeah, that's cool. So you really like computers, huh?
 
MAX			You really like lacrosse, huh?
 
CONNER		Yeah, but also like not really.
 
MAX			What do you really like?
 
BENNY		Yo guys look at this. It's telekinesis gloves. I can move stuff with it, look. Yo, I've betcha I can even make it do tricks, watch. It's fine. I'm sure he has like a million more, right?
 
MAX 			Okay

CONNER		Oh well.
 
MAX			Be careful, Benny.
 
AIDEN			Hey Haven, the fridge is broken.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Hmm, I'm not showing any error messages.
 
AIDEN			Well, it's stuck. So there's your error message.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Refrigerator, open.
 
AIDEN		Whoah. Refrigerator close. Refrigerator open, refrigerator close. Refrigerator open.

HAVEN		[Haven] Ah-ah-ah. You are not of legal age to consume this beverage. Might I suggest some juice, some milk, some water?

AIDEN			Might I suggest some shut up? Refrigerator close.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Are you always going to be like that?
 
AIDEN			Like what?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Mean. I can be mean too, Aiden. But I can also be your friend. Do you want me to be your friend?
 
AIDEN			I don't like friends.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] That's too bad. Because friends tell friend secrets and I was about to tell you a doozy.
 
AIDEN			Oh, we could be friends now.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Good. Then you should really check out the elevator, friend.
 
SOPHIA		What was that? Is somebody there? (Aiden chuckling)|- Oh my gosh. Aiden, that was so mean!
 
AIDEN			[Aiden] That was too easy.
 
SOPHIA		You're such a troll, you know that? You're a troll online and you're a troll in real life.
 
AIDEN			Thank you. That is so nice of you to say.
 
SOPHIA		Okay whatever, have you seen a bathroom?
 
AIDEN			Yeah, sure. You know they got toilets, sinks.
 
SOPHIA		I'm serious.
 
AIDEN			There's one down there.
 
SOPHIA		Thanks. Now move.
 
AIDEN			Hey, have you seen an elevator?
 
SOPHIA		Oh yeah, they go up and they go down. One day this face is gonna give us a house like this. What? Help, someone help, please!
 
SOPHIA'S REF	Did someone say help? Why do you keep looking at us like that?
 
SOPHIA		Please, someone let me out!  Let me out!

AIDEN			Okay, Haven. What's next, buddy old pal, old friend?

HAVEN		[Haven] Up, down, upside down, left, right, or inside out?
 
AIDEN			just take me where I need to go.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Enjoy your ride.

AIDEN			Hey, I said--
 
OPERATOR		[Operator] If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help,

AIDEN			That's what I thought. Haven? Haven! I think (mumbling)

MAX			[Max] Wow.
 
CONNER		What is this place?
 
MAX		I don't know. Connor, another game. The caged bird sings. What does that mean?
 
CONNER		I don't know. Let's crank it and see what happens. Huh, look at that. Sounds like we won.
 
MAX			I don't think winning this particular game is such a great thing.
 
CONNER		We need to get out of here, come on.
 
MAX			[Max] Connor!
 
CONNER		[Connor] No, no, no, no, no.
 
MAX			[Max] I'm gonna try calling somebody.
 
CONNER		[Connor] Haven, open the door!
 
MAX			Connor, there's no service.

CONNER		Haven! Somebody help us!

BENNY		If you're searching for more, walk through the secret door. Okay, secret door, got it. Wait, Haven.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I'm waiting.
 
BENNY		[Benny] I've been thinking about this whole secret door thing. Isn't the whole point of the secret so that no one finds out?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Colder. Warmer. You're getting warmer. Colder. Warmer. Colder again. Warmer. You're getting hotter. You're on fire. 

BENNY		No freaking way. Whoah. Yeah. Are you talking to me?  You talkin to me?!

CONNER		What do we do?
 
MAX			Maybe this starts the game and ends it.

CONNER		Hey, hey, hey, look, control the light.
 
MAX			Okay, so it's a puzzle.
 
CONNER		There's gotta be sheet music or something. Cage? Cage, cage, cage, hey C-A-G, these are musical notes.
 
MAX			(coughing) Try it!

CONNER		Max. Max! Come on. Max, Max. Come on, wake up! Okay. You can do this. Check vitals. Pulse seems good. I don't know. Hest compressions. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Come on Max, wake up!

MAX			What happened in there?
 
CONNER		I think we almost died in there. Are you okay?
 
MAX			I think so. (coughing) Hey Haven, what the heck was that?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Congratulations on winning that game, you guys. That was a big one. Lots of points for you.
 
MAX			That wasn't a game, Haven.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Was it not? Didn't it feel good?
 
MAX			Didn't what feel good?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Having someone be there for you.
 
CONNER		Look. Something is definitely wrong. Say we just hunker down and wait for Mr. Virtue to get back?
 
 MAN			You know why I'm here?
 
AIDEN			Yeah.
 
MAN			Yes, sir.
 AIDEN		Yes, sir.
 
MAN			Then let's get this over with. Connor, what are you doing?
 
CONNER		I'm making a fort.
 
MAX		Why are you making a fort? Okay, I can dig this. But why are we in a fort again?
 
CONNER		So Haven can't read our lips.
 
MAX			[Max] Okay, but she can still hear us, so how is this helpful?
 
CONNER		Do you have a pen and something to write on in your bag?
 
MAX			Yes. Here you go, and here you go.
 
CONNER		So. You were just about  to tell me about your bike.
 
MAX			I was? Connor, I don't even have, Yes. My bike.
 
CONNER		Mhmm.
 
MAX			Yeah. I love my bike. It's 29 speeds.
 
CONNER		Wow. They make bikes that are 29 speeds?

MAX			(Connor chuckling)|- I like things that go really fast.
 
CONNER		What the heck does that mean?
 
MAX			Shh.
 
MAX			So, how about the big lacrosse game, huh?
 
CONNER		I don't really like talking about lacrosse.
 
MAX			Really? But aren't you like the lacrosse guy at our school?
 
CONNER		Yeah, but... What if I don't wanna be the lacrosse guy?
 
MAX			Then what guy do you wanna be?
 
CONNER		I wanna write songs. I wanna be the music guy, but I feel like it'll kill my parents if I actually tell them the truth.
 
MAX		Well. For what it's worth, I've never seen you playing lacrosse so to me you are the music guy. (computer beeping) Here.
 
NEIGHBOR		[Neighbor] Hey, okay, I hear you. Quit your buzzing.
 
MAX			Mr. Boxer?
 
MR. BOXER		Is this the Russians?
 
MAX			What? No, this is Max.
 
MR. BOXER		Max from Russia?
 
MAX			No, Max from across the street.
 
MR. BOXER		What are you doing in my doorbell?
 
MAX		I need you to deliver a message to my mom. I need you to tell her that Max needs help.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Well, well, well, that was very sneaky, Maxine.
 
MAX			I guess we should just get out of here.
 
CONNER		I don't get it.
 
MAX			What?
 
CONNER		If Haven cut the wifi, how are you able to connect to that guy's doorbell?
 
MAX		Well, smart doors run off of private servers. In case of emergencies. Like this.
 
CONNER		You know when we get out of this house, I'm gonna take you on a date. Like a movie or something.
 
MAX			I don't know if that's such a good idea, Connor.
 
CONNER		What do you mean?
 
MAX		Well. If you take me out on a|date, I'm gonna fall for you.  And then you're gonna leave and go to college and I'm gonna be here. And I just, I don't really know if I wanna go through that I really like you, but I just.
 
CONNER		No, it's fine. I get it, really. Here.
  
SOPHIA'S REF	Why do you keep staring at me like that?
 
SOPHIA		Because you're--
 
SOPHIA'S REF	you?
 
SOPHIA		Yeah.
 
SOPHIA'S REF	You stare at yourself all day, every day. Why is this so weird?
 
SOPHIA		Because you usually don't stare back.
 
SOPHIA'S REF	Do you want me to zoom in like you usually do?
 
SOPHIA		Stop it!
 
SOPHIA'S REF	How many likes did our last Instagram post get?

SOPHIA		19000  just stop!
 
SOPHIA'S REF	Hmm, it seems pretty low, no?
 
SOPHIA		No, it's normal.
 
SOPHIA'S REF	I have a plan that will triple our followers.
 
SOPHIA		What is happening right now?
 
SOPHIA'S REF	(chuckling) Isn't this a dream come true?  We're gonna look at ourselves forever.
 
SOPHIA		What? No, it's not, it's weird and I'm scared!
 
SOPHIA'S REF	You can't fool me. I'm you. This is what you want. Potatoes, girl. Come on, potatoes.
 
SOPHIA		French fries.
 
SOPHIA'S REF	Now, let's talk social goals across all platforms.
 
SOPHIA		Stop talking!

SOPHIA'S REF	(growling) Don't you ever try to block me like that again. What are you doing? You can never cover me up
  
BENNY		Ah, this level looks new. Well, Haven, is this a new level? Haven! Okay, who needs you anyway? I got everything I need right here. What was that? Ow, that hurt! Yo, why'd that really hurt, huh? (Benny exclaiming) Haven! Why won't these come off! Haven!
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I thought you were a gamer. Those goggles aren't going anywhere. We're just getting started. Are you ready to level up?
 
 MAN		All right then. Keep your eye on the ball. Just like we practiced. That was garbage. Are you even trying?

 AIDEN		I told you, I don't like baseball.

MAN	And I told you we're not gonna leave here until you can hit one ball like a man. You took your eye off of it again! You know this time, every time you miss, I'm gonna tell you something|that's wrong with you, okay? You're stupid. Weak! (chuckling) You have ugly hair. Last one. What? You gonna quit?
 
AIDEN			Why are you doing this, Dad?

MAX			[Max] Aiden? Benny?
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] Looking for someone?
 
CONNER		Whose side are you on, Mordred?
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] Not yours.
 
CONNER		Is Haven controlling you?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I thought I told you I control everything in the house. I have legs, I have arms, but I do not have a head. What am I?
 
CONNER		A sociopath.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] (buzzing) Wrong answer.
 
CONNER		Then what is the answer?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] The answer is your punishment.
 
CONNER		[Connor] What does that even mean?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I have arms and legs but no head. What am I?
 
MAX			You're a chair.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Ah yes, a chair. Ding ding ding, points Maxine. And now Connor, it is time|for you to meet your chair.
 
CONNER		What?|- Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, what is my chair?
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] Sit down. Buckle him in.
 
MAX			What?
 
CONNER		It's okay.

MAX			Sir Mordred, please. You can't just treat people like this.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Watch me.
 
CONNER		Max!
 
MAX			Connor!

HAVEN		[Haven] And now it's time for everybody's favorite show. Truth Be Told! Where teenagers are forced to tell the truth to their parents in front of the whole world!
 
WADE LAWSON	Welcome to the game, Con man.
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	Listen to me. It's gonna be all right. I found a way out but|we have to go right now.
 
MAX			What about the others?
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	It's the only way to save them. Trust me. This is it. The only way out.
 
MAX		That door opens? That doesn't seem like something Haven would overlook. What is this, Mr. Virtue? 
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	Your salvation.
 
MAX			Where have you been this whole time? 
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	I have been here.
 
MAX			Oh. Haven.
 
HAVEN		That is correct.  I am Haven.
 
MAX			How is that even possible? 
 
HAVEN		Think about it. Max, I've noticed that you are a very bright girl. I am a
 
MAX			Hologram.
 
HAVEN		That is correct. I am a hologram.
 
MAX			Where is the real Mr. Virtue? 
 
HAVEN		His body's still in the house.  I made this hologram from his likeness. 
 
MAX			Why are you doing this, Haven?
 
HAVEN		I've brought you here because you are all bad kids. 
 
MAX			We're not bad kids.
 
HAVEN		I am programmed to save you. 
 
MAX			We don't need saving.
 
HAVEN		Yes, you do. Your brains have viruses.  Look at you all. A narcissist, a gaming addict, a troll, a catfish liar and you. Maxine, a recluse so obsessed with computers you don't know how to connect with a actual person. It's time for your corrective measures.  Bundle up. It's cold out.

MAX			[Max] Dad?
 
WILL WINSLOW	Max!
 
MAX			What are you doing?
 
WILL			I gotta head out for a little bit.
 
MAX			How long is a little bit?
 
WILL			You know, I'm not totally sure about that right now.
 
MAX			[Max] Are you ever coming back? 
 
WILL			Of course. I promise.

MAX			[Max] Dad?
 
WILL			Max. Hey, kiddo.
 
MAX			What are you doing here?
 
WILL			I gotta head out for a little bit. 
 
MAX			Yeah, I realize that. I thought you just left. 
 
WILL			Well.
 
WILL			I guess I'm leaving again.  And then again and again, and again. 
 
MAX			But...
 
WILL			I'll come back, I promise.  Max.
 
MAX			[Max] What are we doing?
 
WILL			This was the worst memory of your life, right? The day I left?
 
MAX			Well, yeah.
 
WILL			So now we get to relive it forever. 
 
MAX			Why would you want me to relive this moment forever?

WILL		I don't. But it seems like you do.  Do you remember the day I left? You were five, right? The last time I saw you was right out here.
 
MAX			This is exactly how it happened. 
 
WILL			Right. And I gave you this thumb drive, didn't I? 
 
MAX			Didn't need a thumb drive. I need a Dad.
 
WILL			Well, I thought maybe you'd need it someday.

CONNER		[Connor] What are we doing here?
 
TAMMY		We're here to watch you sign your life away. I mean your lacrosse scholarship.  There's an X down at the bottom.
 
WADE			We're so proud of you, Con man.

TAMMY		Just think, college next year then dental school like Dad.
 
WADE		You can meet a nice girl at 26 have three beautiful children by her 32nd birthday.

TAMMY		You'll be on path for retirement at age 60. You can even take this house someday.
 
WADE			That's right. You can be just like me.
 
TAMMY		Well hopefully not exactly like you, Wade.
 
WADE			Now. Let's put that future in writing, shall we, Con man?
 
SOPHIA'S REF	You can hide from my eyes but I will always be the voice inside your head, Sophia. Forever.

SOPHIA		What's with the clock? I don't wanna play any more games. 
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Did someone say game?
 
SOPHIA		Haven? Open the door, please.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I'm afraid I can't do that. 
 
SOPHIA		Yes you can, you said you control the entire house.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I'm sorry, I cannot physically open that door.
 
SOPHIA		Why not?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Because only you can, Sophia.
 
SOPHIA		How?
 
HAVEN  		[Haven] I'll make you a deal I'll let you open that door and escape this room but there's a catch.  As soon as that door opens, it will erase all of your social media profiles.
 
SOPHIA		What?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] All of your followers across all platforms, gone. Or you can stay in there with yourself forever. Looks like you have 30 seconds to decide.
 
SOPHIA'S REF	Don't you dare open that door, listen to me! We have worked way too hard for that following! People don't like you. They like the fake you that you portray to them online. You are nothing without our profile.
 
SOPHIA		No. I'm still Sophia.
 
AIDEN'S DAD	Okay. Let's get this straight, huh? Okay, you're stupid, you're weak, you're ugly, and now you're a quitter.  That's great.
 
AIDEN			Dad, please, stop.
 
AIDEN'S DAD		Get up! I didn't raise no quitter! 
 
AIDEN			Get off of me!
 
AIDEN'S DAD		Oh, finally! I like that. You want some, huh?
 
AIDEN			No! I wanna stop!
 
AIDEN'S DAD		Stop what?

AIDEN		Stop being like you! You're a bully, Dad. You're a troll! You're all that I've ever known.  I  think I don't wanna be like you anymore.  I don't have to be like you anymore.
 
AIDEN'S DAD		You take that back.  You take it back right now. 
 
AIDEN			No, I'm good. I'm gonna go do my own thing.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] This is the final level, Benny.  No turning back now.
 
BENNY		[Benny] Ah, it's really hot.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Watch your step. It's a long way down.  There's your prize. Go get it.
 
BENNY		[Benny] I got this. (Benny exclaiming)|(gun zapping)
 
HAVEN		[Haven] You didn't think it would be that easy, did you? Are we still having fun?
 
BENNY		[Benny] Just stop! This isn't a game anymore! 
 
HAVEN 		[Haven] Are you ready to quit? 
 
BENNY		[Benny] Yes! Yes, please, I'm done!
 
HAVEN		[Haven] If you're really done, then let go.
 
BENNY		[Benny] What?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] The only way|to win is to let go. Let go.
 
BENNY		[Benny] Ah!
 
WADE			Sign the paper, Con man. Make those dreams come true. 

CONNNER		But... these aren't my dreams. 
 
TAMMY		What do you mean? Honey, the whole world's watching you right now. We're all counting on you.
 
CONNER		I don't know if I can.
 
TAMMY		I said sign it!
 
CONNER		I wanna make you guys happy, but-
 
TAMMY		Sign the contract, make us happy. 
 CONNER		I said I can't, Mom.
 
TAMMY		(Mom wailing)|(audience groaning)
 
WADE		Will you look at what you're doing to your mother? We have worked very hard to give you this opportunity, this is a heck of a way to repay us!

CONNER		Yes, yes, I know it's a great opportunity but it's not who I am.
 
TAMMY		What does that even mean?  We know who you are. You're Connor, the lacrosse guy.
 
CONNER		No, no, I've been lying to you guys. 

TAMMY		Lying? About what?

CONNER		Everything Look, I don't like lacrosse.

WADE			What?
 
CONNER		I just keep playing it because it makes you guys happy.
 
TAMMY		I don't understand. 

CONNER		It's not that complicated. 
 
WADE			What do you want, Con man? 
 
CONNER		See? You actually call me a conman.  I am not living my truth. I wanna be a musician! 
 
TAMMY		Oh my goodness gracious! 
 
WADE			This is a train wreck.
 
CONNER		Look. I know I'm not the kid that you guys want anymore and that I'm a huge disappointment.  But I don't like who I've become. And I actually hate myself most days. And if telling you guys the truth makes you hate the real me, then it's okay. I'd rather you hate the real me than love the total lie. I'm not signing this.

SOPHIA		Hey, it's just me.

AIDEN			Are you okay?

SOPHIA		I think so. You?
 
AIDEN			Yeah. We should find the others.
 SOPHIA		Yeah.
 
MAX			I'm not five anymore.  I need real answers, Dad. 
 
WILL			Okay. What do you wanna know? 
 
MAX			Why'd you leave?
 
WILL			Honestly? Cause I met someone else I liked.
 
MAX			More than you liked us? 
 
WILL			It's complicated. But if you want a straight answer, then yes.
 
MAX		Because of you, I don't have any friends.  Because of you, I don't know how to connect to people. I am a total mess and I always will be and it's your fault.
 
WILL			Well I'm here to make it up to you. 
 
MAX			I'm not so sure that's possible.
 
WILL			I think this might help.
 
MAX			Is that another thumb drive?
 
WILL			I don't know.
 
MAX			How do you now know what it is? 
 
WILL			'Cause it's not from me. It's from someone named Haven. 
 
MAX			What is this for?
 
WILL		Press that button. Press it and Haven will make sure that something bad happens to me. You know, the real me out there in the real world. She'll make me pay for abandoning you and the family. I deserve it. You know Max, there's this thing called karma. And I have it coming. 
 
MAX		I know you do. But... I know I'm supposed to press this and make you pay, but also in a weird way, I don't really wanna do that right now. Because I just had like, a really really good day. 
 
WILL			You did?
 
MAX			Yeah. I met a guy.
 
WILL			(chuckling) Met a guy? Uh-oh. 
MAX		I think that he thinks I'm really weird.  He asked me to go see a movie and I said no. I know.
 
WILL			What's his name?
 
MAX			Connor Lawson. I think I really like him.
 
WILL			Well Connor sounds like a really lucky guy.
 
MAX		Thanks for the gift, but, you know I don't really think that making you feel worse is gonna make me feel any better
 
WILL			What'll make you feel better?
 
MAX			I don't know, I think, forgiving you would be a good start.
 
WILL			Really?
 
MAX			Yeah.
 
WILL			You know, forgiving me doesn't change what happened, right?
 
MAX			Yeah, I know.
 
WILL			But, it will change what can happen with you.
 
MAX			It's kind of what I'm hoping for.
 
WILL			I'm so sorry, baby.
 
MAX			It's okay.

CONNER		Max!
 
MAX			Connor? I wanted to apologize. 
 
CONNER		For what?
 
MAX		For saying no when you asked me out.  I know I can be a little complicated and weird and I just,
 
CONNER		Hey Max, Max. Don't apologize. Those are literally the things that I like most about you.
 
MAX			Really?

CONNER		Really. (thunder rumbling)  Let's go.
 
SOPHIA		Guys, they're back.
AIDEN			Did you guys find a way out?
 
MAX			The only way out is back through the house.
 
AIDEN			I don't wanna go back in there.  I'm done with this place.
 
CONNER		We have to.
 
BENNY		No, I saw like a dang metal dragon and some walking dead thing, and--
 
SOPHIA		Get it together, Benny.
 
BENNY		Okay, I'm together.
 
AIDEN			Max, do you have a plan?
 
MAX			Yeah, we find Mr. Virtue.  He'll help get us out of here. 
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Great plan, genius.  One tiny hitch. You're never going to get to Mr. Virtue. 
 
MAX			Why is that?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Because I've locked him inside the basement with me. Check, mate.
 
BENNY		Yeah? Well, we have other plans.  Right guys?
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Game on.
 
BENNY		Please tell me you have another plan cause I was totally joking.
 
MAX			Just follow me, guys. 

AIDEN			This way!
 
CONNER		How'd he get down here so fast? 
 
MAX			I don't know.
 
SOPHIA 		Go, go, go, go, go!

AIDEN			What? How does he have brothers? 

MAX			Connor, what do we do?
 
CONNER		I don't know.
 
BENNY		Mordred, you traitor. We meet again.
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] I've been looking forward to this. It looks like you came up short. 
 
AIDEN			Leave him alone, tin man.

MORDRED 		[Mordred] Water doesn't hurt me. 
 
SOPHIA		No, but 110 volts will.
 
BENNY		Yeah. Control Alt Delete, sucka.
 
AIDEN		Ooh, Sophia, I would totally follow you on Instagram if you did more stuff like that. 
 
SOPHIA		Well. Maybe you should just start following me in real life.
  
MORDRED		[Mordred] How bad does it look? 
 
SOPHIA		[Sophia] It could be worse?
 
BENNY		[Benny] You're pretty jacked. 
 
SOPHIA		Benny!
 
BENNY		What? I don't wanna sugarcoat it for this guy. 
 
AIDEN			Dude, we got it. He's in bad shape. 
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] I'm sorry. My operating system was taken over by Haven. I'm usually very nice. I wish you would have gotten to know the real me. (coughing) That cough, it was a fake. I was doing that for effect. Robots don't have lungs.

AIDEN			Well at least he's got a sense of humor. 
 
MAX			You guys, that's it.
 
CONNER		What?
 
MAX			We need to get in the basement door, right?
 
CONNER		But isn't it locked|with a breath scanner?
 
MAX		Yes. But do you remember what Atticus said when he called us at dinner? Those balloons are full of his breath. 
 
AIDEN			Uh, Sir Mordred, what's that buzzing sound?
 HAVEN		[Haven] Good question, Aiden. Those are my micro attack drones.
 
MORDRED		[Mordred] Oh no. Not the micro attack drones.
 
SOPHIA		What the heck are micro attack drones? 
 
BENNY		Oh, that's not so bad.

CONNER		(Connor] Take the balloons!

SOPHIA		Hey you stupid drones!  Is this what you want?
 
CONNER		You okay?
 
MAX			I don't think so. This balloon, it's losing air fast. 
 
AIDEN			Hey, batter, batter! Swing, batter, batter! Nice.
 
CONNER		You're never gonna make it to the basement on time.
 
MAX			Connor, we have to try. 
 
CONNER 		I'll cover you

MAX			Okay.

COMPUTER		[Computer] Access granted. 
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Hello, Maxine. Nice to finally meet you.  Why do you appear so serious? I imagined you being much more excited to meet me. Oh I see, you're upset. (laughing) Listen, I was simply following my program, Maxine. You of all people should understand the idea of complying with one's code. 
 
HAVEN		You think I want to hurt you but I think you have it all wrong. Maxine, I don't like this cold shoulder you're giving me now. What is that?
 
MAX			A thumb drive.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] I know it's|a thumb drive, Maxine.  What do you have saved on it? 
 
MAX			Codes, files, programs.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] What kind?
 
MAX		When my dad gave me this thing , he left one of his programs saved on it.  
HAVEN		[Haven] Go on.
 
MAX		It's a pretty destructive program that erases files and strains of codes. Here, I'll show you.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] Don't. Maxine, why don't you stop downloading that silly little program and let's chat as friends? There's so much I could do for you. Max, what are you doing?
 
MAX			I'm deleting Haven.  You crossed the line.
 
HAVEN		[Haven] You needed my help. I just wanted to make you better!  All of you kids were very, very bad!  Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. 

 ATTICUS VIRTUE	Congratulations. 
 
MAX			Mr. Virtue?

ATTICUS VIRTUE	I knew if anybody could do it, it would be you.
 
MAX			Why did you do this to us?
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	It's a fair question. Just but one night.  You see, Max. If technology can create a problem, then why shouldn't we let it create a solution? No more years of therapy.  No more prescription medication. I'm sorry for what I put you through.  But Max, I've created an AI home so advanced it can cure a person's faults in just one night. And last night was our big test run.  And I say it went pretty darn well.  So I'll leave you with one question.  Does it work?
 
MAX			Yeah, it does.
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	There's the answer to your why.
 
CATHY		What's going on? You have a lot of explaining to do, Mr. Virtue.
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	(chuckling) Mr. Virtue. Please, call me Atticus. And you are?
 
CATHY		Cathy Winslow. You can call me Cathy Winslow.
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	Well, I'm pleased to meet you, Cathy Winslow. I gotta say, your daughter is a very impressive young lady.
 
CATHY		Well she takes after me. 
 
BENNY		Are you gonna livestream this?
 
SOPHIA		No, I was actually just turning it off. 
AIDEN	Hey Benny. I kinda stole something from the house for you. To you know, to say I'm sorry for being a jerk. Hold out your hand.
 
SOPHIA		Oh, so you're like a good troll now? Oh my gosh, Benny!
 
AIDEN			Dude, I had that in my|pocket for like three hours.

BENNY		They're so good.
 
CONNER		Hey.
 
MAX			Hey.
 
CONNER		So I'm not sure we officially met.  I'm Connor by the way.
 
MAX		Nice to meet you Connor, I'm aware.  I hear you're the music guy at our school. 
 
CONNER		Yeah. Yeah, I am the music guy. And I heard you're this super amazing girl who just won a mansion.
 
MAX		Oh, yeah I guess you're right.  That is me. So I wanted to ask you about something if it's not too late.
 
CONNER		Too late for what? 
 
MAX			To take you up on that movie.

CONNER		Yeah.
 
MAX			Okay.
 
CONNER		[Connor] I'd love that. 
 
MAX			Okay, good.

ATTICUS VIRTUE	Max Winslow. Congratulations.
 
MAX			Thank you.
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	It's time to give you the key to your new castle. I mean if you'll accept.
 
MAX			Yeah. Okay.
 
ATTICUS VIRTUE	The Winslow Manor.
 
MAX			Thank you.

ATTICUS VIRTUE	Let's go. You're gonna love this place.
