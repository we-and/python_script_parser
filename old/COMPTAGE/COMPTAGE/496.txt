STORYTELLER	A Most Singular Engine
STORYTELLER	One day, Diesel was sent to Arlesburgh to pull trucks on the line where Ryan and Daisy work...
DIESEL	Hello, Daisy the diesel!
DAISY	Diesel railcar thank you very much!
DIESEL	Well, as I’m shunting trucks between Harwick and Knapford the line will be much improved with we two diesels working here.
DAISY	I'm not just any dieselI'm uniqueA most singular engine...
DAISY	...I’m certainly not the same kind of Diesel as you are.
DIESEL	Ohhh
STORYTELLER	Daisy really is a one of a kind, uniquely useful...
STORYTELLER	...and she never tires of reminding the other engines about this!
DAISY	Railcars carry passengers, you know, SkiffAnd I am the only one on the Island Of Sodor...
DAISY	I don't pull dusty old trucks...
DAISY	...they would be bad for my swerves.
DAISY 	There's no other engine like me…Oh! So rude!
STORYTELLER	Diesel was cross with Daisy the diesel railcarHe thought she was very full of herself.
STORYTELLER	And he was fed up with her boasting!
THOMAS	You know- a real one of a kind engine! Uniquely useful! The only one on the North Western Railway!
DIESEL	Oh I'm sick of hearing about "Daisy the diesel railcar"! 
PERCY	Who's talking about Daisy?
THOMAS	I was talking about Harvey.
STORYTELLER	Harvey is a tank engine with a crane mounted on top of his boilerA unique engine, one of a kind…
STORYTELLER	…then Diesel saw a way to show Daisy that she wasn't the most singular engine on Sodor!
DIESEL	Hullo, Harvey.
HARVEY	Oh..ummmHello, Diesel.
DIESEL	Did you know that Daisy has been saying she is the most uniquely useful engine on Sodor?
HARVEY	Well, we're all usefulIn our own way.
DIESEL	Yes, yes HarveyBut..do you think she's more useful than you? With your crane?
DIESEL	Because that's what she's been saying!
HARVEY	Oh…Really...?
DIESEL	More or less!
HARVEY	WellThat's not a very nice thing to sayI can be useful too.
DIESEL	That's not what Daisy thinks!
STORYTELLER	So Diesel started spreading rumours and causing problems between Harvey and Daisy.
DIESEL	Hey, Ryan! You'd better look out for your friend DaisyHarvey's been saying he's much more useful than she is.
RYAN	Oh
DIESEL	The engine with a craneYou must know himThere's no other engine like him on the whole of Sodor.
DAISY	No, DieselI DON'T think I do know himBut HE should certainly know there's no engine like ME! 
DIESEL	HAHAHAHA
DAISY	How rude!
DIESEL	Well she says she can carry passengers without a coachThat's much more useful than having a crane and silly wooden buffers – 
RYAN	What's going on with you and Harvey? He's been saying he's more useful than you...?
DAISY	(Scoffs)
DIESEL	If I were, Harvey, I'd give that Daisy a piece of my mind! Anyway, ThomasMust dashTrucks to shunt and all thatHahahah
THOMAS 	Hello, HarveyWhat's going on between you and Daisy?
HARVEY 	I don't know! Everyone keeps asking me about thatShe sounds like a rude and unpleasant engineI hope I don't run into her.
DIESEL	<CACKLING!>
STORYTELLER	Daisy was on her way to Harwick too, when there was trouble...! 
DAISY	Ohhh…
DAISY	Harvey!	
HARVEY	Daisy? 
HARVEY	Is there a problem?
DAISY	These cratesOn the line.
HARVEY	Oh.
DAISY	I guess I'm going to be delayed nowThat's not very useful, is it?
HARVEY	Well, I could move the cratesWith my craneBut then I would be running late, too.
HARVEY	Err I have to go and pick up a replacement passenger coach for one that Diesel derailed this morning.
DAISY	<Gasp> No need for that! I can pick up the extra passengers..without a coach!
HARVEY	Oh! How useful is that?!
DAISY	Very useful! But, right now, not as useful as having that..swingy thingy!
HARVEY	Oh aha you mean my crane! <LAUGHING> Right!
HARVEY	So I'll move these crates…
DAISY	And I'll pick up the extra passengers!
DAISY	And you'll never guess what? They did the puppet show right there!
HARVEY	<LAUGHING> That sounds so funny! 
DAISY	It was magnifique!
HARVEY	<LAUGHING> Magnifique!
DIESEL	You're not supposed to be friends!
DAISY	<LAUGH>
HARVEY	<LAUGH>Why would you ever think we wouldn't get along Diesel?
DIESEL	But..you're both so..different! A diesel..railcar!? And a steamy..with a crane?! Ohhhhh
DAISY	<LAUGH>
HARVEY	<LAUGH> Oh dear…what's the matter with him?
DIESEL	Ohh ohh silly engines..acting like they're so special...
STORYTELLER	Diesel was in such a grumpy mood that he didn't notice the points were set towards the ramp...
STORYTELLER	...that lead down towards the sea!
DIESEL	Argh! No! I don't want to go-- !!! 
DIESEL	<Walla> My bottoms wet!
HARVEY	<Harvey walla> Don’t worry Diesel I’m here! <walla>
DIESEL 	Harvey? Why are you helping me? I wasn't very nice to you.
HARVEY	Ha!I know, Diesel, but I'm always willing to help! hehe
DAISY	Do you know what I think, Harvey?
HARVEY	What's that, Daisy?
DAISY	Maybe what makes an engine really special is not how they look - but what they do! Like you, Harvey, helping Diesel after he's been causing all that trouble.
HARVEY	But Diesel can be uniquely useful too, Daisy..when he's pulling trucks and helping on the railway.
DAISY	<Walla>
STORYTELLER	Daisy the diesel railcar likes that her new friend Harvey is so different.
DAISY	…And with that crane you're not just a bog-standard engine…<gasp> c'est fantastique! <Giggles>
STORYTELLER	And Harvey admires Daisy...
HARVEY	Ha! Oh, Daisy! You do make me chuckle with your funny words!
STORYTELLER	...just for being Daisy!
DIESEL	Comes on you two! Some of us are trying to be useful here! 
DAISY	See you later, Harvey! Aha Au revoir!
HARVEY	Bye, Daisy! <Chukcles>
DIESEL	What a pair..of 'most singular engines'! Honestly!
DAISY	<Giggles>
HARVEY	<Giggles>
