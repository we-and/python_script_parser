Skull Tattoo		Hey!

LIM Chun-ho		Please! Don’t kill me!

LIM Chun-ho		If you spare me,|I’ll do anything for you.

PARK Woong-chul	Goddammit…

PARK Woong-chul	What’s all the fuss about?|I was nailing my topstitch.

PARK Woong-chul	What’s going on? A riot?

Prison Officer		The newbie is a total nut job.|He’s in for killing a man.

PARK Woong-chul	How come you’re just watching?

Prison Governer 1	We could get hurt...

Prison Governer 1	and you arrived just in time.

PARK Woong-chul	And you still get your paycheck?

PARK Woong-chul	Outta the way.

Prisoner 2		The big boss is here.

Prisoner 3		Shit, it’s him.

Prisoner 4		We gotta get outta here.

PARK Woong-chul	Don’t you get tired of this?

PARK Woong-chul	Don't just stand there.|Clean up this mess.

PARK Woong-chul	The fight is over.

KO Yoo-sung		What the hell…

PARK Woong-chul	Clueless bastard.

PARK Woong-chul	Oh, shoot! My glove!

PARK Woong-chul	That son of a bitch…

PARK Woong-chul	I could’ve ruined it.

KO Yoo-sung		Stop.

KO Yoo-sung		Come back here.

Prison Governer 2	Stop! All of you!

PARK Woong-chul	What is it?

Prison Governer 2	I thought I should show you this.

PARK Woong-chul	No.

Prison Governer 2	You were never an actual gangster.

Prison Governer 2	You did what you did for a friend

Prison Governer 2	then took the fall for everything.

Prison Governer 2	I’m sorry it worked out this way|but don’t let it ruin you.

Prison Governer 2	I’ll give you a two-day leave to see him off.

PARK Woong-chul	You’ve got no other friends?|No one to hang out with?

NAM Myung-suk	No, I got someone here.|Why do I need anyone else?

PARK Woong-chul	Cut the crap.|Something bothering you?

NAM Myung-suk	When you were around,|your name alone solved problems.

NAM Myung-suk	Not anymore.

PARK Woong-chul	I told you to quit.

PARK Woong-chul	You’re too soft.|You aren’t cut out for this job.

NAM Myung-suk	I heard you picked up sewing.

PARK Woong-chul	Just to kill time... it’s a hobby.

PARK Woong-chul	My old man has a drycleaner’s.

NAM Myung-suk	And my mom raised the six of us|with her sewing machine.

NAM Myung-suk	She used to wear one of these|all the time.

NAM Myung-suk	To look after her hand,|the tool of her trade.

PARK Woong-chul	So this belonged to your ma?|You sure I can have it?

NAM Myung-suk	I support what you’re doing.

PARK Woong-chul	Man...

PARK Woong-chul	I don’t know if my hand will fit.

PARK Woong-chul	It does. Wow!

PARK Woong-chul	It definitely gives you|a sense of professionalism.

PARK Woong-chul	Right?

PARK Woong-chul	You caught your daughter’s killer.|Why are you living like this?

PARK Woong-chul	I have something to ask you.

OH Gu-tak		If it’s about your friend,|you wasted your trip.

OH Gu-tak		It’s cancer.

OH Gu-tak		I’ll be meeting my daughter soon.

OH Gu-tak		Don’t bother me. I wanna go quietly.

OH Gu-tak		Mi-young came to me a few days ago.

OH Gu-tak		She’s snooping about the Junggu Clan.

OH Gu-tak		She thinks they might be|behind your buddy’s murder.

OH Gu-tak		Look her up.

YOO Mi-young's	What’s with the last minute prisoner transfer?

YOO Mi-young	We do what we’re told,|no questions asked.

PARK Woong-chul	Long time no see, little lady!

YOO Mi-young	You’re calling from your phone?|Did you break out?

PARK Woong-chul	Just a short leave.

YOO Mi-young	You make prison sound like high school.

PARK Woong-chul	I wanted to say thanks|for helping with my dad.

PARK Woong-chul	He’s much better now.

PARK Woong-chul	We should catch up.|I’ll wait outside your work.

YOO Mi-young	Sounds good.

KO Yoo-sung		Find another seat.

Bus Driver		What the hell?|I checked it before we left.

Bus Driver		You checked too, right?

Prison Of Bus Conv1	How…We gotta problem. I repeat. We gotta problem. We need to stop for gas.

YOO Mi-young	Are you kidding me?

YOO Mi-young	Copy. Round up all escorts.

YOO Mi-young	CK, surveil up front.

YOO Mi-young	We’re changing course to C,

YOO Mi-young	stopping at gas station 45.

YOO Mi-young	This is Bell 1. Do you copy?

Driver 1		Copy. S-1 to C course.

Prison Of Bus Conv1	Transfer bus to C course.

Driver 2		S-2 to C course.

Female Cop		Okay, you’re done.

KWAK No-soon	All that running must’ve|upset my stomach.

Female Cop		Open this door. Kwak No-soon! I’ll tear it down! Kwak! What are you doing in there? You hear me? One… Two… Three!

KWAK No-soon	Was that necessary?

KWAK No-soon	And my name is Jessica,|not No-soon.

KWAK No-soon	Jessica?

Female Cop		Whatever…

KWAK No-soon	My stomach hurts real bad.|Can we stop by the hospital?

Female Cop		Come on.

Senior Cop		What’s the ETA?

YOO Mi-young	About an hour.

YOO Mi-young	Wow, you finally caught her.

Senior Cop		She was a slippery one.

Senior Cop		Her site was based in Myanmar,|so we searched all of Yangon.

Senior Cop		But turned out her operation was here|the whole time.

Senior Cop		One of the residents dug up|a box of money in a field.

YOO Mi-young	What about accomplices?

Senior Cop		No such thing.|She seems to fly solo.

YOO Mi-young	Is that possible?

Senior Cop		Doesn’t make sense, does it?

Senior Cop		But if anyone could pull it off,|it would be her.

Senior Cop		She’s the real deal.

Senior Cop		And global too.

KWAK No-soon	I’m feeling nauseous.

KWAK No-soon	Seriously.|I think I might be pregnant.

Female Cop		The station first…

Senior Cop		You don’t give up, do you?|-

KWAK No-soon	You been pregnant before?

KIM Chang-min	What the fuck?

KIM Chang-min	Shit…


KIM Chang-min	Let go of me!

KIM Chang-min	What are you doing?|Aren’t you gonna go?

KIM Chang-min	What are you doing?

KWAK No-soon	Man, oh man…

KWAK No-soon	I’m getting outta here.|Can’t let all that money go to waste.

YOO Mi-young	Hello, I’m Detective Yoo|with the Seoul Met Police.

YOO Mi-young	Hello? Can you hear me?

KO Yoo-sung		What the hell…

Skull Tattoo		Noh Sang-sik, you’re coming with us.

KO Yoo-sung		Who are you?

KO Yoo-sung		Where are you taking him?

KO Yoo-sung		Can you hear me?|The transfer bus has been in an accident.

KO Yoo-sung		On Route 39,|near Gyeongcheon Gas Station.

KO Yoo-sung		1-6, do you copy?

KO Yoo-sung		Come in, 1-6.

KO Yoo-sung		1-6?! Dammit…

KO Yoo-sung		Son of a bitch!

KO Yoo-sung		Who are you?

Pickpocket		Outta the way!

KO Yoo-sung		Stop, you bastard!

PARK Woong-chul	The only two people that treated me|like a human being ended up this way.

PARK Woong-chul	I’ll take care of it.

PARK Woong-chul	You take care of yourself.

PARK Woong-chul	Let’s do this.

Thug 1			You fucking bastard!

PARK Woong-chul	Come here.

PARK Woong-chul	Who’s your boss? Where is he?

Thug 2			His name is Noh Sang-sik,|but he’s not here.

PARK Woong-chul	Where the hell is he?

Thug 2			In the big house.

PARK Woong-chul	You took out the Dongbang boss|to take over the clan?!

Thug 2			No! After our boss went inside...

PARK Woong-chul	If I hear a single lie...

Thug 2			We merged with Dongbang.|I’m telling the truth!

PARK Woong-chul	Damn…

OH Gu-tak		I knew you’d be here.

OH Gu-tak		It looks like more than a day’s job.

KWAK No-soon	You saw the news?|Get me a passport and a flight.

KWAK No-soon	No time for explanation. Hurry!

CHO Dong-chul	Can I get some tea?

UHM Jung-han	What would you like?

CHO Dong-chul	Actually, coffee with milk|and extra sugar, please.

CHO Dong-chul	I’m getting a sweet tooth|because I’m tired.

UHM Jung-han	I know how it’s been for you.

CHO Dong-chul	This one and this one…

CHO Dong-chul	we arrested these two today.

CHO Dong-chul	This one, this one, and this one...

CHO Dong-chul	we got a lead on their whereabouts,|so it’s just a matter of time.

CHO Dong-chul	But these three and this woman|are still missing.

CHO Dong-chul	They’re the big ones.

UHM Jung-han	Any info on the attacker|or who’s behind it?

CHO Dong-chul	This is the Junggu Clan boss,|Noh Sang-sik.

CHO Dong-chul	It could be one of his boys

CHO Dong-chul	but who would stick their neck out|for a clan practically defunct?

CHO Dong-chul	We’re checking all possibilities.

CHO Dong-chul	Once this hiccup passes,

CHO Dong-chul	will you officially become|the youngest commissioner ever?

UHM Jung-han	Is that jealousy I hear?

CHO Dong-chul	I’m happy to see my classmate prosper.

CHO Dong-chul	I just hope you’ll help me up|once you get to the top.

UHM Jung-han	Listen, seven of our men|got killed in this incident.

UHM Jung-han	If you’re done drinking coffee,|go out and bring in those bastards!

UHM Jung-han	And let me worry about who I pull up.

CHO Dong-chul	Well, I’d hate to taint|your reputation as a clairvoyant.

CHO Dong-chul	I’ll be on my way.

CHO Dong-chul	Woah, look who’s here!

CHO Dong-chul	You’re Oh Gu-tak, founder of|the legendary Special Crime Unit, right?

CHO Dong-chul	I’m Detective Cho, in charge|of the prison bus escape case.

OH Gu-tak		I’m not in the mood for introductions.

OH Gu-tak		Bring me up to speed.

UHM Jung-han	The Junggu clan is a mafia organization|based in and around Seoul.

UHM Jung-han	The boss is Noh Sang-sik.

Gangs			Morning, sir.

Gangs			Mr. Chairman!

UHM Jung-han	He recently took over Sammi Savings Bank|with funds from God knows who and has been playing entrepreneur ever since. The clan was growing fast, getting powerful|until his recent bust. About a month ago, Noh called|Detective Yoo from prison. He’d received death threats|and wished to come clean. He said he wasn’t the actual leader. The de facto boss is of incredible|financial means and political  connections, and on his way to subjugating the|underground finance world. He claimed he has a bribe book|to back his wordsand that he’s willing to hand it over. He demanded strict confidentiality|until safety was guaranteed. Then a few days later, there was a second assassination attempt...

OH Gu-tak		So an urgent transfer was arranged,|and this happened. There was clearly a leak, meaning a mole within the force?

UHM Jung-han	To be honest, I don’t know where to start...

OH Gu-tak		You can’t trust anyone and|you want this to go away quickly and quietly.

UHM Jung-han	First things first.

UHM Jung-han	I’ll get you reinstated.|Tell me what you need.

UHM Jung-han	I’ll provide full cooperation.

OH Gu-tak		We’ll unleash the dogs again.

CHO Dong-chul	It’s like handing it to him|on a silver platter.

NAM Young-kyu	Sir?

CHO Dong-chul	A few years ago, they launched|an unconventional crime unit.

NAM Young-kyu	So the rumor was true?|They used inmates to catch criminals?

CHO Dong-chul	You remember when

CHO Dong-chul	that massive organ-trafficking|network was broken up?

NAM Young-kyu	Yeah.

CHO Dong-chul	The police-DA joint operation|sat on leads for a full year, but that crime unit brought it all down in 3 weeks. They busted into the network’s den|and went straight to the top. First, the Muscle grabs the butcher|who snaps a man’s neck like a twig, and cuts all the tendons|in his wrists and ankles. Second, the Mad Dog doesn’t hesitate|to shoot any criminal he encounters. Third, the relentless, crazy Bitch Cop moves through|thugs like a shredder through paper. And fourth, Jung Tae-su finishes the job. No one can clean up|scum like he can. He’s a mad, man-killing machine. They’re all veritably mad. This case is big,|with a promotion at stake. Let’s do it right.

NAM Young-kyu	Yes, sir.

OH Gu-tak		You’re a three-time commendation recipient for|arresting the West Village boss and rounding up the|White Tigers and the entire Miari Clan. How did you end up in jail?

KO Yoo-sung		I didn’t get a chance to ask|the perp I was chasing about his medical record|before he started running from me. He dropped dead of a heart attack. 5 years for involuntary manslaughter.

OH Gu-tak		They wouldn’t do that|for one tragic accident.

OH Gu-tak		There was also brutality, tainting the force’s name,|assault causing bodily harm, insubordination, etc… Top of your class at the academy… But like your father, you weren’t|interested in climbing the ladder.

KO Yoo-sung		What do you know about the old man?

OH Gu-tak		I worked with him briefly.

KO Yoo-sung		Then not long enough for him to suffocate you.

OH Gu-tak		He was a way better cop|than I could ever be.

KO Yoo-sung		Are you just being respectful for the dead or what?

OH Gu-tak		You got some mouth on you.

OH Gu-tak		Alright, I’ll cut to it.

OH Gu-tak		You must’ve heard about|the Special Crime Unit.

OH Gu-tak		We don't care about procedures|or what the top brass say.

OH Gu-tak		We just catch bad guys.

OH Gu-tak		There is one rule though.

OH Gu-tak		You can beat, cut,|smash perps up all you want, but you gotta bring them back|to me breathing. Solve this case, and we’ll knock|5 years off your time.

KO Yoo-sung		I’ll pay my dues one way or another, but I get antsy being locked up. So I’m excited to crack|some criminal skulls again. Also, there’s a personal debt to settle.

OH Gu-tak		How come it’s just you?|Where’s Tae-su?

PARK Woong-chul	He’s done getting blood on his hands.

OH Gu-tak		I believe you two have met.

OH Gu-tak		This is your partner from today on.

KO Yoo-sung		Partner, my ass…

PARK Woong-chul	I heard about you.

PARK Woong-chul	If you’re gonna do this,|do it with a smile on your face.

KO Yoo-sung		Yeah, whatever. Let’s get to work.

OH Gu-tak		Park Sung-tae, 45.

OH Gu-tak		Starting with the murder of|a professor and his wife 10 years ago,

OH Gu-tak		he’s killed 8 people|over a period of 2 years.

OH Gu-tak		He targets the elder and women.

OH Gu-tak		He was arrested in 2007|and sentenced to death.

KO Yoo-sung		A devil unleashed to the world|after 11 years.

PARK Woong-chul	What he needs is a good beating.

OH Gu-tak		Next, Kim Chang-min.

OH Gu-tak		He has a rap sheet|with any crime you can name on it,

OH Gu-tak		but he only got 15 years.

OH Gu-tak		What’s notable about him is

OH Gu-tak		he broke out of prison in 2009|and was on the lam for 907 days.

OH Gu-tak		57 officers were submitted to|disciplinary measures
	
OH Gu-tak		and 7 were relieved of their posts.

OH Gu-tak		He’s fast on foot,

PARK Woong-chul	good with his fists.

KO Yoo-sung		And in excellent shape.

PARK Woong-chul	How do you know his shape?

OH Gu-tak		Our third target is

OH Gu-tak		Noh Sang-sik.

PARK Woong-chul	Let’s make this clear,|I call dibs on him.

OH Gu-tak		They suspect the whole incident

OH Gu-tak		was to snatch this guy.

PARK Woong-chul	I don’t understand how|a third-rate clan no one’s heard of

PARK Woong-chul	can suddenly rise to power and|take over major cities so quickly.

PARK Woong-chul	It doesn’t make sense.|An unanswered question.

KO Yoo-sung		Why not?|Who subjugated Seoul in just 25 days

KO Yoo-sung		by taking over 1 district a day|from Guro to Nowon?

PARK Woong-chul	That was a long time ago…

PARK Woong-chul	And by the way, stop talking|to me like I’m your little brother

PARK Woong-chul	or I’ll smack some sense into you.

OH Gu-tak		Both of you knock it off.

OH Gu-tak		Lastly, there’s Kwak No-soon.

OH Gu-tak		She operated an illegal gambling site,

OH Gu-tak		milking millions from gambling addicts.

PARK Woong-chul	Wait, I know her.

PARK Woong-chul	She’s called...

PARK Woong-chul	Jessica!|A friend of Chul-joo’s.

OH Gu-tak		Yoon Chul-joo? The crook?

PARK Woong-chul	Yeah, the greasy-looking one.

OH Gu-tak		Remember, use your words, not hands.

PARK Woong-chul	Of course not. Like the saying goes...

PARK Woong-chul	Be good to those you know.

KO Yoo-sung		What kinda bullshit is that?

YOON Chul-joo	You know everyone around here|uses my towel.

Restaurant owner	I know, but customers|complained about the smell.

YOON Chul-joo	Who complained?

YOON Chul-joo	Some damn sharp noses?

YOON Chul-joo	What smell are they talking about?|Shit…

YOON Chul-joo	Don’t you know who I am?

YOON Chul-joo	I’m Park Woong-chul.|From Guro to Nowon,

YOON Chul-joo	I wiped out 1 district a day,|taking over Seoul in just 25 days.

YOON Chul-joo	That’s it.|Closing business today.

YOON Chul-joo	What are you doing?

YOON's Underling	Sorry, boss.

YOON's Underling	Everyone out! I said out!

YOON Chul-joo	We’re closing for the day. Bye!

YOON Chul-joo	Come on, keep smiling.

YOON Chul-joo	Isn’t he finished?|Or is he deaf?

YOON Chul-joo	Hey, little one…

PARK Woong-chul	Long time, Chul-joo.

PARK Woong-chul	Or is it Woong-chul now?

YOON Chul-joo	I, I can’t believe this…

YOON's Underling	Is everything okay, boss?

YOON Chul-joo	Sure.

YOON's Underling	Hey, punk. Do you have any idea|who this man is?

YOON Chul-joo	Don’t worry about it.

YOON's Underling	What’s the matter, boss?

YOON Chul-joo	Oh, I remember!

YOON Chul-joo	Good to see you again.|You must’ve been released.

PARK Woong-chul	You little shit....

YOON's Underling	How dare you talk to my boss like that?

YOON Chul-joo	Stop. Don’t.

YOON Chul-joo	Don’t do that.

YOON Chul-joo	Well, this is my buddy, Chul-joo.|We go way back.

YOON's Underling	Oh, the crook that used to work|under you, right?

YOON Chul-joo	Not under me. No.|He’s my best friend, you know?

YOON Chul-joo	Stop offending my buddy|and get outta here.

YOON's Underling	Yes, boss.
YOON Chul-joo	Go.

PARK Woong-chul	Hey, get back here.

YOON's Underling	What the hell…

PARK Woong-chul	You will pay for everyone you threw out|and clean the place up, understand?

YOON's Underling	Yes... sir.

PARK Woong-chul	Chul-joo, come here.|I wanna talk to you.

YOON Chul-joo	Will you just leave me alone?!

PARK Woong-chul	You wrote to me saying|you’ll leave the past behind.

YOON Chul-joo	I’m sorry, man…|for not keeping my word -

OH Gu-tak		You didn’t hit him, did you?

OH Gu-tak		You were gentle with him?

PARK Woong-chul	It’s good to see you too!|It’s been a long time.

PARK Woong-chul	Why didn’t you write more often?

PARK Woong-chul	Yeah, I missed you too.

OH Gu-tak		You...

PARK Woong-chul	You must be very tired.

YOON Chul-joo	Jessica! Jessica!

KWAK No-soon	Hey!

KWAK No-soon	Did you get what I asked for?

YOON Chul-joo	Of course.

YOON Chul-joo	Let’s enjoy tequila by the Iguasu Falls.

KWAK No-soon	Sure thing.

KWAK No-soon	What’s the matter?

YOON Chul-joo	Oh… nothing.

KWAK No-soon	You’re sweating like a pig.

YOON Chul-joo	It’s… hyperhidrosis. That’s all.

YOON Chul-joo	See you later.

KWAK No-soon	You know, I wasn’t entirely sure|when I asked you to help.

KWAK No-soon	I thought you might sell me out to the police.

KWAK No-soon	So I got this just in case.

YOON Chul-joo	Jessica!

KWAK No-soon	You didn’t tell, did you?

YOON Chul-joo	Don’t be ridiculous! Though|I would’ve understood if you had.

YOON Chul-joo	Because we’re friends…

KWAK No-soon	You fucking idiot!

OH Gu-tak		Kwak No-soon!

KWAK No-soon	I’m gonna kill you!

KWAK No-soon	Good to see you again, Captain!

OH Gu-tak		Let’s not make a scene.

KWAK No-soon	There are 5 exits and just 2 of you.|You’ll never catch me.

YOON Chul-joo	You are in danger.

PARK Woong-chul	Come here.

KWAK No-soon	Stop.

KWAK No-soon	Stop!

YOON Chul-joo	Help me.

KO Yoo-sung		Kwak No-soon…

KWAK No-soon	Fine. I’m turning myself in.

Politician 1 (Hiker 1)	Huh?

Politician 1 (Hiker 1)	Hey, it’s been so long.|I almost forgot your face.

Skull Tattoo		I’m sorry I didn’t visit more often.

Skull Tattoo		Pay respects to him.

LIM Chun-ho		Sir, my name is Lim Chun-ho.|I’m the new CEO.

Politician 1 (Hiker 1)	Good. How’s the Chairman?

Skull Tattoo		Very well. How’s the food?

Politician 2 (Hiker 2)	Rice wine after hiking is the best.

Politician 1 (Hiker 1)	The Chairman always knows|exactly what I want.

Politician 3 (Hiker 3)	Have a great time here,|and let us pass the budget review.

Skull Tattoo		Enough talk of state affairs.

Hiker 4			Let’s have a good time.

Hiker 5			Have you been taking something?

KWAK No-soon	Captain, can I have a word?

KWAK No-soon	Clearly there’s been a misunderstanding.|I need to talk to you.

OH Gu-tak		Someone’s coming to pick you up.|Won’t be but a moment.

KWAK No-soon	At least untie me.

KWAK No-soon	You can’t do this.|I turned myself in, remember?

KWAK No-soon	Uncuff me. Come on!

PARK Woong-chul	Hey!

PARK Woong-chul	You’re loud and annoying.

PARK Woong-chul	I’ll uncuff you if you’ll shut up.

PARK Woong-chul	There. You better keep quiet now.

KWAK No-soon	Thanks.

KWAK No-soon	Captain, what is this place?

KWAK No-soon	Some kinda torture chamber?

PARK Woong-chul	Shut up and sit down, will you?

KWAK No-soon	In a minute.

PARK Woong-chul	Don’t try my patience...

PARK Woong-chul	Why... why are you doing this?

KO Yoo-sung		Captain…

KO Yoo-sung		We gotta lead on Noh.

OH Gu-tak		He’s on the run with|legendary fugitive Kim Chang-min,

OH Gu-tak		who’s dodged police detection|for over 3 years now.

OH Gu-tak		What are the police doing?

KO Yoo-sung		They’re reinforcing checkpoints|and police force

KO Yoo-sung		throughout the province of Gangwon.

KWAK No-soon	But that’s not Kim’s style.

KO Yoo-sung		You know him?

KWAK No-soon	Oh, very well.

KWAK No-soon	I partnered with him briefly|while working over some old misers.

KWAK No-soon	He’d rob their houses|while I distracted them.

PARK Woong-chul	She’s bullshitting her way through this.|Take her away.

KWAK No-soon	How dare you say that about me!

KWAK No-soon	Captain…

KWAK No-soon	There’s no one that knows him like I do.

KWAK No-soon	He was begging to meet me|the last time he broke out of prison.

PARK Woong-chul	Just get her out of here.

OH Gu-tak		Wait!

OH Gu-tak		Why don’t we hear|what No-soon has to say?

KWAK No-soon	Now we’re talking.

KWAK No-soon	By the way, it’s not No-soon.

KWAK No-soon	It’s Jessica.

KWAK No-soon	I would kill for that sweet...|what is it?

KWAK No-soon	Caramel Macchiato.

KWAK No-soon	I indicated where Kim was|during his escape in 2009.

KWAK No-soon	He broke out in Busan

KWAK No-soon	and went into hiding for 907 days,|covering 40,000km.

KWAK No-soon	And he never once appeared|in Gangwon province.

KWAK No-soon	Why?

KWAK No-soon	Because no one lives there.

KWAK No-soon	You poke your head out,|and you’ll be noticed instantly.

KWAK No-soon	He didn’t go there.

KWAK No-soon	He just shot a smoke bomb off|to divert attention.

KO Yoo-sung		Then where do you think he is now?

KWAK No-soon	In 2010, he appeared briefly|in Gaepo, Seoul.

KWAK No-soon	He gave 13,000 cops the slip|and after just 2 days,

KWAK No-soon	turned up in Iksan 200km away.

KWAK No-soon	He made his way down on|nothing but fucking milk and bread.

KWAK No-soon	Pardon my French.

KWAK No-soon	And the police? They were|searching the sewers of Gaepo.

KWAK No-soon	You really wanna catch Kim?

KWAK No-soon	Forget statistics and logic.

KWAK No-soon	You need a humanistic|and emotional approach.

PARK Woong-chul	What the hell are you saying?

KWAK No-soon	You dense, dumb...

KWAK No-soon	It’s women.

KO Yoo-sung		When he was arrested in 2011,|Kim famously said

KO Yoo-sung		there was only|one woman he ever loved.

OH Gu-tak		Give that to No-soon.

PARK Woong-chul	Wait, are you telling us to work|with this nut job?

KWAK No-soon	Oh, come on, sweetheart.

KWAK No-soon	It’ll be fun working together.

PARK Woong-chul	Don’t call me sweetheart.

PARK Woong-chul	Hey, can you work with her?|Be honest.

KO Yoo-sung		I don't care. Whatever.

PARK Woong-chul	Ridiculous.|- Some cooperation, please?

OH Gu-tak		She’ll come in handy, that’s for sure.

PARK Woong-chul	I don’t know…

KWAK No-soon	Are you kidding?

KWAK No-soon	I’m supposed to wear this?

KWAK No-soon	What happened to human rights?

PARK Woong-chul	Wear it or you’re out.

KWAK No-soon	But my million dollar legs...

KWAK No-soon	Urgh, I can only do the pants for now.

OH Gu-tak		Whether you like it or not,|that’s the condition

OH Gu-tak		if you wanna work here.

OH Gu-tak		These exceptionally proud two|are wearing them without complaints.

OH Gu-tak		Catching the small fish knocks off 3 years.|The big one, 5.

OH Gu-tak		Not a bad deal, huh?

OH Gu-tak		If I catch the big one,|I’m exonerated immediately…

KWAK No-soon	Here.

KWAK No-soon	Wow…

KO Yoo-sung		These are the women who|helped him while he was on the run.

KO Yoo-sung		Their locations and jobs are all different.

PARK Woong-chul	There’s gotta be a link somewhere.

PARK Woong-chul	How many women is that?

OH Gu-tak		How can we categorize them?

KWAK No-soon	Love proportion.

KWAK No-soon	The longer you travel,|the more often you need to take a dump.

KWAK No-soon	So we follow the smell.

PARK Woong-chul	What... is she getting at?

KWAK No-soon	It took days for Kim|to travel to his next woman.

KWAK No-soon	What’s his nickname?|- 

KO Yoo-sung		The Romantic Outlaw.

KWAK No-soon	Exactly.

KWAK No-soon	But still an outlaw.

KWAK No-soon	Still stealing to live.

UHM Jung-han	I sent over the record

UHM Jung-han	of open, nationwide theft cases|since the escape.

OH Gu-tak		I appreciate it.

UHM Jung-han	Remember,

UHM Jung-han	Kwak is a five-time fraud convict.

UHM Jung-han	Use her carefully then ditch her.

KWAK No-soon	No studios or small apartments.

KWAK No-soon	Too much unnecessary attention.

KWAK No-soon	Look for houses at least|3,500 sq.ft. and in affluent areas.

KWAK No-soon	Where things haven’t changed|much since the 90’s.

KWAK No-soon	Houses with high walls,|that’s what we want.

PARK Woong-chul	What is she doing to the map?

KWAK No-soon	Kim never revisits the same area twice.

KO Yoo-sung		I think she’s marking patterns|and directions in color.

PARK Woong-chul	Oh... what the hell’s that mean?

OH Gu-tak		Just let her do her thing.

KWAK No-soon	Done.

KWAK No-soon	Choi Sun-mi?

CHOI Sun-mi		Who are you?

KWAK No-soon	Someone that can help.

CHOI Sun-mi		What are you talking about?

KWAK No-soon	You’re taking him food|this late at night...

KWAK No-soon	You think it’s love, don’t you?

KWAK No-soon	You’re wrong.|He’s just using you.

CHOI Sun-mi		What do you know about him?

KWAK No-soon	Oh, I know him.|Want me to convince you?

KWAK No-soon	He must’ve told you|about his miserable past,

KWAK No-soon	how the world is the problem,

KWAK No-soon	but now he’s repenting|and he can’t live without you.

KWAK No-soon	Snap out of it.|That’s his repertoire.

KWAK No-soon	The women he sweet talked into|helping him he simply used then ditched...

KWAK No-soon	There are 15 in the police record alone.

KWAK No-soon	My own sister fell victim|to the same trick.

KIM Chang-min	It’s good.

KIM Chang-min	You’re an amazing cook.

KIM Chang-min	I’ll open a restaurant for you one day.

CHOI Sun-mi		Honey, listen...

CHOI Sun-mi		The police came to me earlier.

OH Gu-tak		Kim Chang-min,|where’s Noh Sang-sik?

PARK Woong-chul	Why would they make a road like this…

PARK Woong-chul	All this unnecessary work at night.

PARK Woong-chul	Get up.

CHOI Sun-mi		Chang-min?

CHOI Sun-mi		You okay?

CHOI Sun-mi		They’ll say you turned yourself in.

CHOI Sun-mi		Don’t worry.
CHOI Sun-mi		What are you doing?

KIM Chang-min	You’re so dumb. I was gonna|keep you around for a bit longer.

KWAK No-soon	Once a scum...

KIM Chang-min	It was you.

PARK Woong-chul	I didn’t know you had a sister.

KWAK No-soon	A crazy girl.

KIM Chang-min	Bring it on. I’ve got nothing to lose.

KIM Chang-min	Goddammit!

KIM Chang-min	Bitch! I’ll kill you!

PARK Woong-chul	You piece of shit…

PARK Woong-chul	Get up.

PARK Woong-chul	What the hell?

PARK Woong-chul	You...

OH Gu-tak		That son of a bitch!

CHO Dong-chul	Back up, back up!

KWAK No-soon	What’s wrong?

PARK Woong-chul	Captain?

PARK Woong-chul	You okay?

KWAK No-soon	Captain?

PARK Woong-chul	What is it?

KO Yoo-sung		Just fucking great....

KWAK No-soon	I’m not going anywhere.

KO Yoo-sung		I knew this was gonna happen|when you paired with a criminal.

KO Yoo-sung		He’s not at the church,|and he’s not answering his phone.

OH Gu-tak		Track down his ankle monitor.

KO Yoo-sung		Then what?

KO Yoo-sung		What am I supposed to do|with you in the hospital?

OH Gu-tak		You know what the difference is|between your father and us?

OH Gu-tak		If a perp jumped into a fire pit,|you and I would chase them into it.

OH Gu-tak		We’re not too bad as cops.

OH Gu-tak		But your father prevented|countless crimes in advance.

TEXT			Superintendent|Ko Chang-ho

OH Gu-tak		Woong-chul is ready to|live as a changed man.

OH Gu-tak		He just hasn’t had the chance yet.

OH Gu-tak		With his flesh and bone,|he’s expiating in his own way.

LIM Chun-ho		Show me some respect.

Pub Lady		Okay, okay…

LIM Chun-ho		Do you know who I am?

Thug 3			What’s going on?

PARK Woong-chul	Wake up.

LIM Chun-ho		Hey!

PARK Woong-chul	Did I sober you up?

LIM Chun-ho		It wasn’t me, man.

PARK Woong-chul	I know.

PARK Woong-chul	You don’t have the balls to do that.

PARK Woong-chul	So who’s the actual boss of the clan?

LIM Chun-ho		They call him the Chairman.|I saw him once.

LIM Chun-ho		They say he’s like a phantom -

PARK Woong-chul	Chun-ho…

LIM Chun-ho		Yeah?

PARK Woong-chul	Remember how we used to|go to the sauna together,

PARK Woong-chul	you, me, and Myung-suk?

PARK Woong-chul	For old times’ sake,|I need you to be honest with me.

LIM Chun-ho		Of course.

PARK Woong-chul	Where is their hideout?

LIM Chun-ho		I was taken there once,|but the car windows were blacked out.

LIM Chun-ho		I think it was near Incheon Port.

PARK Woong-chul	Who are they?

LIM Chun-ho		Shit...

LIM Chun-ho		I’m not the loser that used to|rub your back at the sauna anymore!

PARK Woong-chul	Any more goons?

PARK Woong-chul	Come back here.

KO Yoo-sung		Ever heard of teamwork?|Don’t go rogue on us.

LIM Chun-ho		Stop, stop.

LIM Chun-ho		Stop!

LIM Chun-ho		Man...

PARK Woong-chul	It was the Junggu boss|that killed Myung-suk.

KO Yoo-sung		So let’s pay Chang-min|a visit at the station.

PARK Woong-chul	We gotta find Noh anyhow.|He holds the key.

KWAK No-soon	Okay, let’s go.

NAM Young-kyu	Who are you?

CHO's crew 1		Damn… you okay?

CHO's crew 		Call an ambulance!|-

CHO's crew 2		What was that?

CHO Dong-chul	That crazy fucker…

KO Yoo-sung		Chief Cho…

KO Yoo-sung		this should make us even.

KO Yoo-sung		Oh, and...

KO Yoo-sung		if you ever touch one of mine again,|I’ll bash your fucking head in.

KO Yoo-sung		A message from Captain Oh.

KO Yoo-sung		Where’s Noh?

KIM Chang-min	Why should I tell you that?

KO Yoo-sung		You got nothing for me then?

KO Yoo-sung		You better heed those words.

KIM Chang-min	You’re all insane!

KWAK No-soon	Chang-min…

KWAK No-soon	I get so turned on

KWAK No-soon	just thinking about kicking your ass.

KIM Chang-min	Crazy bitch...

KWAK No-soon	Where’s Noh?

KWAK No-soon	Not gonna tell me?

KWAK No-soon	Don’t change your mind, okay?

KIM Chang-min	Hey... wait!

KIM Chang-min	A few of us ran to the bus terminal.

KIM Chang-min	We just happened to be there together!

KIM Chang-min	It’s the truth!

PARK Sung-tae	Excuse me.|Can I ask you something?

Constable		Sure.

PARK Sung-tae	I want to find my friend’s address.|I have her social security number.

Constable		If she’s your friend, why don’t you ask her?

PARK Sung-tae	Stop.

PARK Sung-tae	I’m asking you because|I can’t ask her myself.

Constable		Why not?

PARK Sung-tae	It’s difficult to say.

Superintendent	You said you know this person.

Superintendent	So why’s it difficult?

PARK Sung-tae	Because she knows|if I find her,

PARK Sung-tae	I’ll kill her.

Constable		What?

PARK Sung-tae	I’m going to kill her.

Constable		What are you…

NOH Sang-sik		You goddamn butcher!|How long do I have to put up with this shit?

PARK Sung-tae	Shit, this will hurt when it’s wet.

PARK Sung-tae	This is it.|The escape boat is tomorrow?

NOH Sang-sik		I’ll get you onboard,|but let’s split up for now.

PARK Sung-tae	I saved your life in the machine room.

PARK Sung-tae	Don’t complicate things.|Just shut up and stick with me.

PARK Sung-tae	Requesting ID.

Panel 1		10,000 police were|dispatched to the wrong place,

Panel 1		and there’s a psycho|serial killer on the loose.

Panel 2		Pandora’s box is wide open.

Panel 2|TEXT		What about collateral damage -|Prisoners still at large. Where are the police?

HAN Mi-jung		I said no.

KWAK No-soon	You’re not listening to us.

PARK Woong-chul	I don’t think you understand...

HAN Mi-jung		Whether he kills me|or I starve to death,

HAN Mi-jung		I wind up dead either way.

KWAK No-soon	You are in grave danger.

HAN Mi-jung		Who are you people?

HAN Mi-jung		That news has been running for days.

HAN Mi-jung		What’re the police doing?

HAN Mi-jung		I wish I’d never reported him.

HAN Mi-jung		He’s the criminal, but|I’m the one living in agony!

HAN Mi-jung		You said it was the right thing to do.

HAN Mi-jung		You said I did the right thing.

PARK Woong-chul	I’m sorry but...

KO Yoo-sung		I can’t speak on behalf of the police,

KO Yoo-sung		but I’m truly sorry.

PARK Woong-chul	We’re not actually with the –

KO Yoo-sung		Yes, sir.

KO Yoo-sung		The Deputy Commissioner wants to see me.

PARK Woong-chul	Catch you later.

UHM Jung-han	Two officers were murdered last night.

UHM Jung-han	This is from the dash cam.

UHM Jung-han	That’s Park, right?|Increase security around -

KO Yoo-sung		Hold on.

KWAK No-soon	She went out the back.

KWAK No-soon	She went to work against our warning.

KO Yoo-sung		Dammit…

Café Lady 1		Good evening.

PARK Sung-tae	You came in early.

PARK Sung-tae	He must be on some kinda blood thinner.|There was a ton of blood.

PARK Sung-tae	I missed you, baby.

PARK Woong-chul	I’ll stand guard.

PARK Sung-tae	Baby, you awake?

PARK Sung-tae	I created a song to help me remember|your social security number.

PARK Sung-tae	7-5-1-0-2-1-4

PARK Sung-tae	2-8-5-0...

HAN Mi-jung		Just kill me already, you nut job...

PARK Sung-tae	Oh don’t worry, I will.

PARK Sung-tae	I’ve been itching to do it for a while.

Café Customer 1	Another drink?

Café Customer 2	I’m in. Where at?

Café Customer 1	How about...

KO Yoo-sung		Hey, Noh Sang-sik!

PARK Sung-tae	Why are you looking at me funny?

PARK Sung-tae	If that’s how you wanna do this...

KWAK No-soon	Open this door!

KWAK No-soon	Open it, dammit!

KWAK No-soon	Son of a bitch!

PARK Woong-chul	Outta the way.

PARK Woong-chul	You piece of shit.

PARK Woong-chul	Come here.

PARK Woong-chul	I wanna kill you, but I can’t.

PARK Woong-chul	So I’ll just kill half of you.

KWAK No-soon	Stay with me.

Nurse			This way!

NOH Sang-sik		Crazy fucker!

KO Yoo-sung		Shit, that was close.|Why did you run?

NOH Sang-sik		Damn you...

KO Yoo-sung		Hi, good to finally see you.

PARK Woong-chul	Get up.

PARK Woong-chul	I told you he was mine.

KO Yoo-sung		Let go of him.

KWAK No-soon	What are you doing?

PARK Woong-chul	I’m gonna kill this bastard|and end it all right here.

KO Yoo-sung		Don’t be an idiot! Killing him won’t|bring back your friend!

PARK Woong-chul	Come again?|You want me to kill you too?

KWAK No-soon	We didn’t go through all this shit|just so you can fuck it up for us!

PARK Woong-chul	Let go.

PARK Woong-chul	Come here.

PARK Woong-chul	You killed Myung-suk, didn’t you?

NOH Sang-sik		It wasn’t me. I swear.

PARK Woong-chul	Don’t fucking lie to me!

NOH Sang-sik		I didn’t do it! Let me explain!

KWAK No-soon	Let’s hear him out.

PARK Woong-chul	Fine…

PARK Woong-chul	Start lying and I’ll rip your tongue out.

NOH Sang-sik		The real boss of the Junggu Clan is the boss of Yoshihara-kye,|a branch of of Yamaguchi-gumi.

PARK Woong-chul	Yakuza?

NOH Sang-sik		Backed by extreme right power,

NOH Sang-sik		Yoshihara started a war against|Yamaguchi, Japan’s largest yakuza.

NOH Sang-sik		After 7 years, Yoshihara|subjugated the yakuza world like Toyotomi Hideyoshi did centuries ago.

NOH Sang-sik		After taking over Japan, he turned his sights outwards,|with enormous money at his disposal.

KWAK No-soon	So they’re basically like a K-pop band.

NOH Sang-sik		5 years ago,

NOH Sang-sik		he approached me right after|I made the Junggu Clan with a few boys.

NOH Sang-sik		He said he’d back me up and make me Korea’s top boss|in return for my loyalty.

PARK Woong-chul	You filthy traitor…

KWAK No-soon	Relax.

NOH Sang-sik		Please, let me finish.

PARK Woong-chul	So you were wiping Yakuza ass.|Why are you even telling us this?

NOH Sang-sik		It all comes down to ice.

PARK Woong-chul	Like... crystal meth?

NOH Sang-sik		Yes.

NOH Sang-sik		One day, Yoshihara took me to a warehouse

NOH Sang-sik		and showed me our next line of business.

NOH Sang-sik		With massive funding from banks,|he bought equipment and manpower

NOH Sang-sik		and began organ trafficking.

NOH Sang-sik		He bribed people up top,|even got laws changed

NOH Sang-sik		to acquire a pharmaceutical company.

NOH Sang-sik		From organ trafficking to meth production...

NOH Sang-sik		I’ve seen some shit in my line of work,|but that was… 

NOH Sang-sik		That was hell on earth.

NOH Sang-sik		He turned our young members into addicts.

NOH Sang-sik		He recruited homeless, illegals,

NOH Sang-sik		kids just out of orphanages,

NOH Sang-sik		made them work for him and even...

NOH Sang-sik		He even used them for testing.

NOH Sang-sik		Just like back in the Japanese occupation.

KO Yoo-sung		With that kind of data,

KO Yoo-sung		they must have amazing knowhow.

NOH Sang-sik		They do.

NOH Sang-sik		They started producing|stuff unlike any existing drugs.

KO Yoo-sung		Why did he want to get rid of you?

NOH Sang-sik		Wait, but… who exactly are you people?

PARK Woong-chul	You don’t ask questions.|You talk and reflect on still being alive.

KO Yoo-sung		You know Detective Yoo?|We’re with her.

NOH Sang-sik		I guess this is how it’s gonna be.

NOH Sang-sik		Yoshihara would’ve built|sales networks,

NOH Sang-sik		probably through arcades and karaoke bars.

NOH Sang-sik		If you don’t stop him,|this country will fall apart.

UHM Jung-han	Fantastic job.

UHM Jung-han	Mission complete! Alright!

PARK Woong-chul	Who are these people?

UHM Jung-han	We’ll take it from here.

UHM Jung-han	You’re good, I gotta give you that.

UHM Jung-han	The police will do things|according to procedure from here.

PARK Woong-chul	I don’t like where this is going.

UHM Jung-han	Bunch of criminals running around,|acting like heroes…

UHM Jung-han	You’ve served your purpose.|It’s time to let you go.

KO Yoo-sung		You know me, don’t you?

PARK Woong-chul	How much did they bribe you|to turn you like this?

UHM Jung-han	It’s not just about the money.

UHM Jung-han	My reputation as the|clairvoyant of Seoul Police...

UHM Jung-han	Let’s just say I got help,|not clairvoyance.

KO Yoo-sung		Yoshihara spoon fed you|juicy cases then pulled strings.

KO Yoo-sung		They put some hard work|into getting you on top.

UHM Jung-han	So now you know|why I brought you in.

KO Yoo-sung		It’s not rocket science.|You’ll take the bribe book,

OH Gu-tak		frame us for snatching Noh|for money, and get rid of us.

KO Yoo-sung		No handcuffs?|You’re gonna do it here?

UHM Jung-han	Clever boy.

UHM Jung-han	You’re the late|Superintendent Ko’s son?

UHM Jung-han	Like your old man,|you’re too damn romantic.

UHM Jung-han	That’s not how the world works.

UHM Jung-han	If you try to be a hero like your dad,|you’ll die like him.

KO Yoo-sung		Son of a bitch!

UHM Jung-han	Wait, wait.

UHM Jung-han	No bullet holes.

UHM Jung-han	Let’s not complicate the autopsy.

PARK Woong-chul	I know your face.|Better not bump into me again.

UHM Jung-han	Take a good look.|What are you gonna do?

UHM Jung-han	This’ll be the last thing you see.

UHM Jung-han	I heard Oh could go any day now.

UHM Jung-han	At least, he’ll have you|to keep him company.

KWAK No-soon	And you call us the criminals?

UHM Jung-han	Shut up, bitch.

UHM Jung-han	We don’t want the|crime scene to reek of petrol.

UHM Jung-han	It’s practically a tinder box.|Just set it on fire.

UHM Jung-han	And make sure they burn with it.

SWAT Team Leader	I’ll report to you later, sir.

KWAK No-soon	Come on, think!

PARK Woong-chul	I can’t if you keep yapping.

KO Yoo-sung		Both of you shut up! The smoke|gets you before the fire.

PARK Woong-chul	Okay, this is gonna hurt.

PARK Woong-chul	What? What’s the matter?

KWAK No-soon	There’s gotta be another way!

PARK Woong-chul	Just stick it out a little longer!

KO Yoo-sung		It hurts bad, like really bad…

KWAK No-soon	Wait!

KWAK No-soon 	I have an idea.

KO Yoo-sung		So do I

KO Yoo-sung		You’re ripping me in two!

PARK Woong-chul	It worked!

PARK Woong-chul	This old building…

PARK Woong-chul	Don’t be dramatic.

PARK Woong-chul	Get up. Let’s get outta here.

PARK Woong-chul	Ugh... my belly…

PARK Woong-chul	What’s wrong with him now?

PARK Woong-chul	Well… shit…

PARK Woong-chul	Goddammit.

PARK Woong-chul	Don’t be embarrassed.|No one saw anything.

KO Yoo-sung		Saw what?

PARK Woong-chul	What’s wrong with her?

PARK Woong-chul	Hey!

PARK Woong-chul	She’s not breathing.

PARK Woong-chul	Geez, you scared me.

PARK Woong-chul	You okay?

KWAK No-soon	I’m okay. I’m fine.

PARK Woong-chul	You sure?

KWAK No-soon	I’m breathing. See?

PARK Woong-chul	What?

NAM Young-kyu	Finish off here.

CHO's crew 1		Yes, sir.

KWAK No-soon	Thanks.

PARK Woong-chul	Are you allowed out here?

OH Gu-tak		Worry about yourselves.

OH Gu-tak		I kept getting a bad feeling,|couldn’t sleep.

KO Yoo-sung		They took the books with them.

CHO Dong-chul	You’re all here.

CHO Dong-chul	Like you said,|something didn’t add up.

PARK Woong-chul	I knew it.

CHO Dong-chul	Geez, you scared me.

PARK Woong-chul	I’m not gonna eat you.

PARK Woong-chul	I have a favor.

CHO Dong-chul	You’re asking me for a favor?

PARK Woong-chul	It’s all about catching the bad guy.|We’re working together.

PARK Woong-chul	Like the saying goes...

PARK Woong-chul	When asked for a favor, do it.

CHO Dong-chul	What?

CHO Dong-chul	Let me at least hear it.

PARK Woong-chul	Look into recent|gang activities in Incheon.

CHO Dong-chul	They’ve kept things low key|for years now.

PARK Woong-chul	Junggu merged with them|without any friction.

PARK Woong-chul	Too quiet, too smooth…

PARK Woong-chul	Something is cooking for sure.

PARK Woong-chul	We gotta find their secret location.

CHO Dong-chul	It’s a huge city.

PARK Woong-chul	They need a lotta people|to run such an operation.

PARK Woong-chul	Look for places with a sudden|flow of people for no reason.

CHO Dong-chul	Okay, but what makes you|think you can trust me?

PARK Woong-chul	Some things are just obvious.

PARK Woong-chul	You don’t seem to have extra|cash to splash on nice clothes.

PARK Woong-chul	You’re still low in rank,|so you’re probably not a kiss ass.

CHO Dong-chul	Okay, okay. I get it.

PARK Woong-chul	Thanks.

CHO Dong-chul	It’s a stuffed toy factory with|no usual factory types working there.

CHO Dong-chul	Only burly men come and go,|and security is very tight.

PARK Woong-chul	So this is the factory.
OH Gu-tak		Gotta be a thug to think like one...

OH Gu-tak		Is that it?

PARK Woong-chul	Something like that.

CHO Dong-chul	Now what?

OH Gu-tak		We catch some Yakuza.|What else?

OH Gu-tak		What? You wanna join in?

CHO Dong-chul	We gotta go too, but

CHO Dong-chul	we don’t have a warrant.

CHO Dong-chul	No. Don’t even think about it.

UHM Jung-han	I told you you could count on me.

Yoshihara		Good work.

Yoshihara		I think you’re ready to trade|your nightstick in for a political podium.

Yoshihara		I’ll arrange a dinner with|the big boss next week.

UHM Jung-han	Thank you, sir.

NOH Sang-sik		Please don’t kill me.

Yoshihara		The only place for a traitor is hell.

Yoshihara		Listen,

Yoshihara		this is worth 30 shots of ice,

Yoshihara		which equates to a grand.

Yoshihara		1kg of ice is 3 million dollars,

Yoshihara		and 10kg, 30 million.

Yoshihara		But I didn't spend tens of millions

Yoshihara		to make petty cash in return.

Yoshihara		This country is a mere test bed.

Yoshihara		Once today’s operation proves solid,|we head mainland.

Yoshihara		Understand?

Yoshihara's H		1,2,3	Yes, Mr. Chairman!

OH Gu-tak		Being outnumbered is one thing, but

OH Gu-tak		getting in will take forever too.

PARK Woong-chul	That’s why I brought in Goblin Foot.

KWAK No-soon	Who the hell is that?

PARK Woong-chul	Someone I used to worked with.

Guard Post Gang1	Who’s this?

Guard Post Gang2	Maybe they ordered from inside.

PARK Woong-chul	You know, he’d give his life|if I asked him to.

OH Gu-tak		That’s a big favor.

Guard Post Gang1	Don’t just stand there,|take it inside.

KO Yoo-sung		Why’s he called Goblin Foot?

PARK Woong-chul	He’s so fast, you don’t see his feet move.

KO Yoo-sung		You thugs are so creative|when it comes to nicknames.

KO Yoo-sung		And No-soon got her name|because her mom had her in the street?

PARK Woong-chul	There he is.

OH Gu-tak		Long time. All good?

PARK Woong-chul	You ready for some heavy lifting?

Skull Tattoo		The deputy’s men got arrested.

UHM Jung-han	So good…

KWAK No-soon	Captain,

KWAK No-soon	if I take out the head,|I get 5 years off, right?

PARK Woong-chul	I can’t help you if you get beat up.|You’re on your own.

OH Gu-tak		Are you ready?

PARK Woong-chul	Let’s do this.

UHM Jung-han	Chairman!

UHM Jung-han	Fucking hell!

UHM Jung-han	I’m a Superintendent General|with the Korean Police!

UHM Jung-han	You wouldn’t dare do this to me.

Yoshihara's H		Open his mouth.

UHM Jung-han	Wait! No!

Yoshihara		The Republic of Korea...

Yoshihara		is there anything that|money can’t do here?

Yoshihara		Covering things up isn’t hard,

Yoshihara		as long as there’s a face|for people to blame..

Yoshihara		Make it that the Deputy Commissioner|did this after taking the drug.

Warehouse Gang	Who the hell are you?

Warehouse Gang	How did you get here?

PARK Woong-chul	GPS is how, you dumbass.

Warehouse Gang	You fucking punk…

PARK Woong-chul	Wait.

PARK Woong-chul	You’re not getting outta here.

PARK Woong-chul	I’m about to bring the|hammer down on this place.

KWAK No-soon	He can be really scary, right?|I mean, look at his face. It’s barely human.

Warehouse Gang	Kill them.

Skull Tattoo		How dare they sneak in here!

Skull Tattoo		1 million apiece,

Skull Tattoo		bring their heads to the Chairman’s office.

OH Gu-tak		That way.

LIM Chun-ho		Come on, get them!

OH Gu-tak		You’re not coming?

PARK Woong-chul	I gotta take care of something.|I’ll catch you later.

PARK Woong-chul	Goblin, make way.

PARK Woong-chul	Come here.

PARK Woong-chul	There’s something|I’ve been meaning to tell you.

PARK Woong-chul	You give shitty back rubs!

PARK Woong-chul	Ha!

PARK Woong-chul	What... aren’t you gonna work?

Skull Tattoo		They’ll take care of this.|You should lay low in Japan for a while.

KO Yoo-sung		Son of a bitch…

PARK Woong-chul	Need a hand?

KO Yoo-sung		No, I got it.|The Yakuza went up to the roof.

PARK Woong-chul	Shit… more stairs?

PARK Woong-chul	Okay! Keep at it!

KO Yoo-sung		I’m gonna kill you today, you asshole.

PARK Woong-chul	You’re not going anywhere!

Skull Tattoo		Tenacious bastard…

Skull Tattoo		I admire your spirit.

Skull Tattoo		Any last words?

KO Yoo-sung		You have the right to remain silent

KO Yoo-sung		and the right to an attorney.|Scumbag.

Skull Tattoo		Crazy bastard…

Yoshihara		It’s been so long.|It makes my blood boil.

PARK Woong-chul	Um… no onions, please.

PARK Woong-chul	Maybe that wasn’t right.

PARK Woong-chul	Just come here.

Yoshihara		Bring it on.

Yoshihara		You bastard.

PARK Woong-chul	Just two more, okay?

PARK Woong-chul	This one’s for Detective Yoo,

PARK Woong-chul	and this one, for Myung-suk.

KO Yoo-sung		Worthless son of a bitch.

UHM Jung-han	Captain Oh,

UHM Jung-han	we’ve got bodies everywhere in here.

UHM Jung-han	If you let this one slip,

UHM Jung-han	I’ll find you a matching liver.

UHM Jung-han	I promise.

OH Gu-tak		What are they paying you?
