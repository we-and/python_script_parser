DANNY		Sure is something to look at.

DANNY	You were smart to pick her.

COLIN	My God.
    
VOICE	Stay here.

DANNY	The smell of success.

JASPER	Colin, we can fix this!

NADIA	Colin.

JASPER	Stop him now!

SARAH	Colin, we are all real.

JASPER	Nothing a little adrenaline can't fix.

COLIN	(gasps!)

JASPER	You think it's bad now?

COLIN	(gasps!) Stay away!

MARTY	One, two, seven Grant. Do you read me? Over.

MARTY	One, two, seven Grant. Do you copy? Over.

MARTY	One, two, seven Grant. Do you read me? Over.

JACK	Hey.

JACK	Colin?

BRENNEN	Hey, Colin!

BRENNEN	Colin, stop! 

BRENNE	Stop! 

JACK	Colin!

BRENNEN	Keep going.

JACK	Colin!

JACK	Get him! Stop him!

BRENNEN	Colin. (to group) Door's locked!

JACK	Get the gate! Come on! Push!

DANNY	Ah... she sure is something to look at.

DANNY	You were smart to pick her.

COLIN	Happy New Year's, Danny.

COLIN		Where are we going?

SARAH	Trying to get you to Medical and take care of you.

JACK	(overlapping) Come on, stay with us.

SARAH	But you're not making it easy on us!

JACK		Come on! Let's go! Stay with me.

BRENNEN	Come on, man! This is a...

BRENNEN	...17 years... 

BRENNEN	...oak barrels. It's a damn shame to waste it on a punk like this.

SARAH	Brennen!

BRENNEN		This is gonna sting a bit.

NADIA	Colin.

WOMAN	Are you okay?

JASPER	We're getting closer. 

JASPER	The storms are increasing.

JASPER		We're running out of time!

SARAH		Hey, Colin. Are you okay?

COLIN	There was someone else in here just now.

SARAH	What?

COLIN		What happened to me? What happened out there? A-am I crazy, seeing things?

SARAH	I don't know. Maybe. Come on, let's sit down.

COLIN	That storm, there were two suns in the sky!

SARAH	Yeah. You remember that.

COLIN	I just saw it--

SARAH	You just saw it again. Come on, have a seat. Come on. Right there.

SARAH	Check your back pocket. 

COLIN	"Your name is Colin. You lost your memory in the event."

COLIN	Wait, what event? 

SARAH	Keep reading.

COLIN	"Last New Year's Eve, a great disaster consumed our planet."

COLIN	"Earth is now in another solar system."

SARAH	That's two suns and five moons.

COLIN	No, no, no, that-that's not possible.

SARAH	Yeah, I've been telling myself the same thing every day, and yet, here we are. Come on, I need you to follow my finger.

SARAH	Good.

COLIN	Wait, wait, wait.

COLIN	Stop the test!

COLIN	New Year's Eve. How long have things been like this?

SARAH	Almost a year.

COLIN	A year? I've lost a year?

SARAH	Yes, Colin. And you should be thankful. Billions of people lost their lives.

COLIN	I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. This is a nightmare.

SARAH	Trust me, it is very real.

COLIN	Wait!

COLIN	I--

COLIN	My wife.

SARAH	Who?
 
COLIN	My wife, my kid, they're out there somewhere.

SARAH	Okay, you've never mentioned them before.

COLIN	No, I need to go find...

COLIN	...them!

SARAH	Hey, you're not going out there. You need to rest.

COLIN	I've rested long enough.

SARAH	I'll be the judge of that!

COLIN	No, you won't!

SARAH	Hey, tough guy! Listen! We've been taking care of you for almost a year. Do you think that's been easy? 

SARAH	Now, you don't need to go outside and have another lapse!

SARAH	And you certainly don't wanna put the people who saved you in danger again.

COLIN	But what if...

COLIN	...she thinks that I'm--

SARAH	It's been almost a year. I'm sorry, Colin, but she's probably gone.

SARAH	The whole world has been ravaged.

SARAH	There's not many of us left.

SARAH		The ones here, we do our best to save, and that includes you. Your memory is coming back. Let's not push it. Come on. 

MARTY	This is one, two, seven Grand. We're in desperate need of...

MARTY	...food and gas and medical supplies. Do you copy? This is one, two, seven Grand. We need food--

SARAH	We're losing power again.

JACK	Oh, Jesus.

MARTY	No gas, no lights.

MARTY		See, this radio is a drain.

JACK	We gotta keep trying. Just keep trying, Marty. Come on. (to Sarah & Brennen) Look, there's still gas out there, and we're gonna have to find it.

BRENNEN	Right. Preferably before one of those hail-bombs sends me to an early grave.

JACK	Marty, I need you to go in with him.

MARTY	Me? I'm manning the radio.

JACK	No, I gotta take over that for you, okay? I need you to do this. Come on, let's get a move on it.

JACK	Things don't stay quiet around here for too long.

BRENNEN	All right, we're going, Jack. We are going. We're going to get our asses killed.

MARTY	Can I go out with someone else?

BRENNEN	What?

SARAH	Just go before things get worse.

BRENNEN	(sighs / chuckles) Right.

BRENNEN	Shit gets worse. You know what? That's the funniest thing I've heard all day.

BRENNEN	(chuckles)

BRENNEN	Yeah.
SARAH	Hey, and be careful.

BRENNEN	Mm-hmm.

JACK	This is one, two, seven Grant. Come in.

DANNY	Well... the proofs are in.

DANNY	What do you think of that, huh? It's perfect, right?

COLIN	Ah...

COLIN	...something's not right.

DANNY	What, are you a perfectionist? We could sell this to the government, double our money, and not have to worry about the little stuff!

COLIN	I knew I smelled something.

DANNY	The smell of success.

COLIN	(chuckles) 

BRENNEN	All right, Rip Van, let's go before another storm heads in. See...

BRENNEN	...I've been carrying your ass for nearly a year now, and I hear that you're right as rain, so... it's time for you to earn your keep.

COLIN	Hey, where we going?

COLIN	So, those things falling from the sky?

MARTY	Methane. They say it gets trapped in the upper atmosphere...

MARTY	...freezes in those huge crystals, and falls from the sky like bombs. It's fun.

BRENNEN	That's nothing, man. The e-clouds, that's what scares the shit out of me.

COLIN	E-clouds?

BRENNEN	Oh, that's right, man, you don't remember.

MARTY	Like thick fog.

BRENNEN	Yeah. 

BRENNEN	Except there's two million volts of electricity flowing through them.

MARTY	You don't remember any of this?

BRENNEN	Look, man, I'm telling you, it's the e-clouds that's messing with our brain! It's like screwing up our wiring!

BRENNEN	All that electricity just flowing through the air...

BRENNEN	...cooking us from the inside out. I'm telling you, man, we're being zombified.

BRENNEN	All right. Keep...

BRENNEN	...your eyes open. And if you find anything let us know, all right? And don't pocket anything! Jack will check you when you get back.

COLIN	Eyes open for what?

BRENNEN	Things for survival, what else?

MARTY	Mainly food, gas...

MARTY	...for the generators, and...

MARTY	...medical supplies.

BRENNEN	Oh, man. You gotta be kidding me.

BRENNEN	Man, look.

BRENNEN	There ain't nothing here. They took everything.

MARTY	Colin?

COLIN	Yeah.

MARTY	Go find some gas.

MARTY	Look for a boiler room.

BRENNEN	Please hurry, before a storm comes.

COLIN	O-okay. Okay.

MARTY	Hallelujah!

BRENNEN	What? What, what, what?

BRENNEN	What did you find? What did you find?

BRENNEN	Pinto beans. Oh, yeah.

BRENNEN	Real jackpot.

PENELOPE	Colin.

COLIN	Hmm?

PENELOPE	Your wife and child are here.

COLIN	Ah!

COLIN	Everyone! Stay calm!

COLIN	My God.

ZOEY	Hey! You got food in that bag?

COLIN	No.

COLIN	Hey! Hey! Stop! I need that bag!

COLIN	Hey!

COLIN	Hey!

COLIN	Come back!

COLIN	Hey! Hey!

BRENNEN		(indistinct)

BRENNEN	Where the hell is he going?

MARTY	Colin!

MARTY	Hey, where are you going?

MARTY	Colin!

MARTY	Colin!

COLIN	Hey!

MARTY	What the hell are you doing out here? Are you crazy? Get back inside! That cloud hits, we're dead!

BRENNEN	Hey! What the hell are you guys doing?

MARTY	Out of the way!

BRENNEN	No!

BRENNEN	Colin, run! Run and take cover!

COLIN	Hey! Wait!

COLIN	Hey! Stop!

COLIN	Shit!

COLIN	Hello?

COLIN	Hello?

COLIN	I know you're hiding in here.

COLIN	Look, you can keep my bag. I just want the book.

ZOEY	Don't turn around! I have a gun, and I...

ZOEY	...swear I will shoot you.

ZOEY	Put your hands up.

COLIN	All right. That's enough of that, okay?

ZOEY	Please, don't shoot.

COLIN	What? I just--

ZOEY	Don't hurt me.

COLIN	Look, I'm really confused right now, okay? Look, I just need the cards in that bag.

COLIN	You can keep the rest. Deal?

ZOEY	He's not gonna let you have them back.

COLIN	Who's--

ALEX	Me.

DANNY	Is that for me?

COLIN	(chuckles) I knew I smelled something.

DANNY	The smell of success.

DANNY	We could sell this to the government, double our money and not have to worry about the little stuff!

COLIN	This is his technology. I'm just carrying out his dream the way he wanted it to be done.

COLIN	Is that enough to get started?

NADIA	Hey. Hey.

NADIA	You with me?

COLIN	Yeah. Yeah, relax.

COLIN	Oh, God.

NADIA	What are these?

COLIN	Memories. It's for me. It's personal.

COLIN	My family's out here somewhere. I need to try and find them.

ZOEY	If your family's out there and you haven't seen them yet? Your family's dead, just like mine.

ALEX	Get up!

ZOEY	Hey, don't--

ALEX	All right, sleeping dipshit. Food. You have it, we want it.

COLIN	No. That's what I came here to find, was food and supplies. Look, I'm telling you, that's what we came here to find!

ALEX	You think those clouds juggled his brains?

NADIA	Like they did yours?

NADIA	Yeah, they probably messed with his memory. He's got amnesia or something.

ALEX	Well, how convenient.

ALEX	But you know what that means, you're no good to me.

NADIA	Alex, don't!

ALEX	You have exactly three seconds to give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you. One...

NADIA	Alex!

ALEX	...two!

COLIN	Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

COLIN	Money. Money. I have money. A lot of money. Cash. In a safe in my office, I swear.

NADIA	I'm sorry, is this a joke?

ALEX	Wait, wait, wait.

ALEX	How much we talking?

COLIN	A hundred grand, maybe more. If you help me find my office building.

ALEX	Well, hell, if you ain't lying, you wouldn't be able to find your own ass with two hands on a road map.

COLIN	No, no, no. My book, my book. No. My book.

COLIN	There's a building...

COLIN	...with this log on it. See?

NADIA	Yeah, and I know the building with the logo, but we need food not money, Alex.

ALEX	It's a lot of money.

NADIA	Forget the money!

ALEX	Shut up!

ALEX	I've been hearing a lot of rumors, okay?  Word is spreading! And you heard the same thing!

ZOEY	We are not getting back!

ALEX	Shut your trap, Zoey. I'm not just making this stuff up!

ZOEY	No, you're too smart for that.

COLIN	Wait, wait, wait. Making what up?

NADIA	Nothing!

ALEX	Go ahead, tell him!

NADIA	People have been saying that whatever happened a year ago is gonna happen again, but this time it's gonna take us home.

ALEX	That's right! And if it does happen, what's the big deal with going back with a extra hundred K in hand? 

NADIA	It's useless! 

NADIA	You do whatever you want. Zoey and I are gonna go find food.

ALEX	Hey! You go... where I go. Now, you can search the building for food, but I'm getting that money. And you're coming with. Both of you!

ALEX	You got that? Huh?

NADIA	Yeah.

ALEX	Good.

ALEX	Get up!

COLIN	All right. Okay, okay.

ALEX	There's no money... you die. If there's no food, you die. If you try anything...you die.

ALEX	You got that?

JACK	I told you he couldn't go! I told you, and now Marty's dead!

BRENNEN	The guy was a liability, and we've been carrying him long enough!

SARAH	That wasn't your decision to make.

BRENNEN	Like hell it was! Our supplies are running out! My supplies! 

JACK	All right.

BRENNEN	My good will only goes so far.

JACK	Oh, your good will only goes so far, huh? Well, it takes us to survive this, okay?

JACK	We have to work together. So you're gonna have to go back out there.

BRENNEN	That is crazy. I'm not going--

JACK	Do you understand me?

JACK	Gerry! Go with him!

JACK	Go. Now. Please.

BRENNEN	Let's go.

NADIA	Keep going! We're not clear yet!

COLIN	So this is the underground?

NADIA	You were expecting the botanical gardens?

COLIN	No, I just heard it was dangerous.

NADIA	You know of any place that isn't right now?

ALEX	Wait.

ALEX	Zoey, check his pockets.

ZOEY	You check his pockets. I'm not touching that.

ALEX	I said check his pockets! Check them!

NADIA	I'm sick of you pointing that gun at us! We're not your prisoners!

ALEX	Hey. Hey.

NADIA	(grunts and gasps)

ALEX	I'm the one who keeps you alive! Right?

NADIA	Fuck you.

ALEX	You got that?

COLIN	All right, that's enough!

ALEX	There we go. There we go.

ALEX	That's two strikes. And there won't be a third.

ALEX	Now you're on borrowed time.

ALEX	Let's move.

COLIN	Hey. Hey. Real charming guy you got there.

NADIA	We're still alive, aren't we?

COLIN	Yeah. For right now anyway.

ALEX	Move. Move.

JACK	We've got sick kids in tents two and three, and we need antibiotics. We are completely out.

BRENNEN	Anything else you need... boss?

JACK	Our medical supplies are dangerously low.

BRENNEN	Yeah. Right.

GERRY	Look, sooner we go, sooner we get back.

BRENNEN	You hope so.

SARAH	Hey, Jack. You know what, they can't go. A nasty report just came over the radio. These storms, they're getting worse. Much worse.

JACK	They have to go.

SARAH	Jack, if you send them out there, they don't come back.

BRENNEN	Hey, hey, hey!

BRENNEN	I'll go. Right? I'm...ah, I'm good. Gerry?

GERRY	I'm good.

BRENNEN	See? We're good.

JACK	Thank you.

BRENNEN	Let's go. Come on.

JACK	We got tent two and three to deal with. Come on.

NADIA	The storm is coming back.

COLIN	My God.

NADIA	Nope. We gotta go back.

COLIN	No, no, that's it.

COLIN	Over there. Come on.

ALEX	Let's go!

ZOEY	He's gonna get us all killed!

COLIN	Come on!

COLIN	Whoa!

ALEX	Move!

NADIA	This place is a death trap!

ALEX	Come on! Come on! Come on!

ALEX	Your office! Where's your office! 

COLIN	Ah...ah...

ALEX	Where is it?

COLIN	Couple of floors up.

ALEX	Your office now! 

ALEX	We'll check every floor if we have to!

ZOEY	Eighth floor, geniuses.

ALEX	Eighth floor. The eighth floor! Stairs! We need stairs!

COLIN	Ah...All right.

ALEX	Stairs!

COLIN	I don't know.

ALEX	Come on, come on! 

ALEX	Come on!

COLIN	I'm going, all right? Take it easy!

ALEX	Come on!

COLIN	I'm looking. I'm looking.

COLIN	Yeah.

DANNY	My future is tied to your decisions.

COLIN		Happy New Year's, Danny.

DANNY	We've built an empire.

DANNY	It's perfect, right?

ALEX	Hey! 

ALEX	Stop stalling and find it!

COLIN	All right. All right.

ALEX	(grunts)

ALEX	Come on!

COLIN	Here. 

COLIN	Here. This is it.

ZOEY	What, you owned the whole building?

COLIN	Ah...Yeah, I guess.

ALEX	Go in!
COLIN	All right.

ALEX	You guys stay here, and you wait.

COLIN	Okay, okay, okay.

ALEX	Find it!

DANNY	The proofs are in.

DANNY	It's perfect, right?

PENELOPE	Colin, your wife and child are here.

DANNY	She sure is something to look at.

DANNY	You were smart to pick her.

COLIN	No. Something's not right.

COLIN		They're not real.

ALEX	What are you doing? Find it!

COLIN	It's-- Gimme a second! It's...

ALEX	We don't have any time! Come on!
COLIN	Hold on! Hold on. Hold on.

COLIN	It's here. It's here.

ALEX	Okay, open it! Open it! 

ALEX	Come on!

COLIN	I am! Hang on! Agh!

ALEX	How about I help you remember!

COLIN	Gimme a second!

ALEX	Come on!

ALEX	Come on!

COLIN	I'm working on it!

COLIN		That's it! Okay. All right, I got it, I got it, I got it.

ALEX	Come on, come on! Money! Where's the money? I want the money! Where is it? Come on!

COLIN	It's right here.

COLIN AND ALEX	(grunts)

ALEX	All right. All right.

NADIA	E-cloud.

NADIA	E-cloud!

ALEX	Now you die! Strike three!

ALEX	Ahh!

NADIA	You're out.

NADIA	Go on! Get outta here! Go, go, go!

COLIN	All right, come on.

COLIN	Come on!

COLIN		Whoa!

COLIN	Okay. Over here. 

COLIN	This way, this way, this way! Come on.

ALEX	I'll kill you!

COLIN & GIRLS	(grunts/heavy breathing)

NADIA	Keep going! Keep going!

COLIN	Don't touch any metal!

ZOEY	Ahhh!

COLIN	Zoey?

NADIA	Zoey! No!

COLIN	Zoey? Hey.

NADIA	Zoey!

JASPER	Get down!

JASPER	(heavy breathing) All right.

JASPER	The storms are increasing.

COLIN	It's you.

NADIA	What was that?

JASPER	This? It's a homemade e-cloud disbursement unit. I like to call her "Bertha". 

JASPER	Now come on, let's go!

NADIA	Come on!

JACK	(into radio) This is one, two, seven Grant. Come in.

JACK	(into radio) This is one, two, seven Grant. Come in.

GROUP	(scream/react)

SARAH	The entire area is becoming unstable.

JACK	Have you seen Brennen and Gerry?

SARAH	No. Jack, we really need to think about moving.

JACK	Move. Are you crazy?

SARAH	Can we at least load the trucks?

JACK	And go where?

JACK	(into radio) This is one, two, seven--

SARAH	Jack!

JACK	I heard you.

JACK	I heard you. (into radio) This is one, two, seven Grant. Come in. 

JACK	(into radio) This is one, two, seven Grant. Come in. Gerry. Brennen. Do you read me?

JASPER	Nothing a little adrenaline can't fix.

ZOEY	What happened?

NADIA	I thought I'd lost you.

JASPER	Nothing a little adrenaline can't fix.

JASPER	Okay.

ZOEY	Easy. I feel like I've been hit by a train.

COLIN	Wait, wait, wait, wait!

JASPER	Come on, I saved the kid. Can we go now?

COLIN	No, no, no! I've seen you before, in my visions. I don't know how to explain this.

COLIN	Okay? You were there. You were in the tent with me.

JASPER	There's no way that's possible, man.

COLIN	Wait! Look! I'm not making this up, okay? You were in there!

COLIN	You said that exact same thing! About the adrenaline! All right? I'm not making this up.

JASPER	Trippy shit. All right, I've heard that people's minds got worked and whatnot.

NADIA	Wait, he's not confused?

JASPER	He might not be. Okay, the moment we went through, space and time, it was warped and folded, right? You could be having a future memory. All right.

JASPER	Guys, we don't have time to explain this. We need to go right now. Come on. Let's go!

COLIN	Let's go!

JASPER	Come on, guys, let's go!

NADIA	All right, fine!

JASPER	Get in the truck! Let's go!

NADIA	Come on!

COLIN	What were you doing here?

JASPER	Preparing.

COLIN	For what?

JASPER	I was looking for something.

COLIN	For what?

NADIA	You think we're going back, don't you?

JASPER	Think? With any luck, I'll be the one that gets us there.

JASPER	Wow, trippy shit, man. Colin, you and I are meant to fix this.

JASPER	This is not a chance encounter.

COLIN	Okay, but what makes you think that you can get us back?

JASPER	Because I was an engineer at Fuel X Corp.

PENELOPE	This is Jasper Borash. He's part of the Fuel Cell team.

JASPER	Are you-- are you-- Are you all right? Are you okay?

JASPER	I was...

JASPER	...in part responsible for the technology that I believe was used to create the wormhole in the first place. Nuclear--

COLIN	Fuel cells.

COLIN	Stop the test!

DANNY	What, are you your father? Come on, he died without any major accomplishments --

COLIN	Danny. This is his technology.

JASPER.	You think the Earth just happened upon a wormhole that slingshot us across the galaxy?

JASPER	No way. No way. Someone or something...

JASPER		...opened up that wormhole. All right, look, we're in the safe zone of those two suns up there, okay?

JASPER	One is a good distance away, but we're currently being pulled towards the other.

JASPER	And when that happens, it's gonna consume the entire planet!

JASPER	And we're running out of time to fix it.

JASPER	Hey. Hey, buddy.

NADIA	Hey, Colin!

JASPER		What are you doing?

JASPER	Are you-- are you okay?

PENELOPE	Hey, you don't-- you don't look so hot.

COLIN	Ah, No, ah, no. Sorry. Excuse me.

JASPER	Sure, sure.

NADIA	Colin.

JASPER	We're running out of time!

JACK	Colin!

PENELOPE	Are you okay? I was worried--

COLIN	I think someone put something in my drink.

JASPER	Okay, here we go. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. There we go. Back it up. Back it up. There we go. Okay.

JASPER	Hooo! Well, welcome to my... home.

NADIA	Hmm. At least your house is still standing.

JASPER	Good, 'cause I don't have apocalypse insurance. But I do have power.

JASPER	(sighs) Oh, man. How's he doing?

NADIA	Not so good.

JASPER	Let's see what we got here.

JASPER	Hey, buddy. Let's check and see.

COLIN	Ahhh!

JASPER	Geez! Don't do that to me!

COLIN	Wha-- wha--?

JASPER	Jesus, man.

COLIN	I saw myself.

JASPER	You what?

COLIN	I saw myself seeing the disaster. New Year's Eve. You were there.

COLIN	Wait, that's not possible.

JASPER	I've talked to survivors who have claimed the same sort of thing. It's...it's like you're... it's like you're living in a time loop between two dimensions. That's the only way that you saw me and saw yourself. Holy turd on a stick! Einstein's doing cartwheels in his grave right about now.

COLIN	Wait, wait, wait.

JASPER	Wait, wait, wait.

COLIN	What? What?

JASPER	There was rumors... There was rumors that you had a...ah...ah, working prototype. The original fuel cell. Is that true?

COLIN	Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I had...I had it in my safe at my office.

JASPER	Are you sure?

COLIN	I think so.

JASPER	"Think" isn't good enough. We only have one shot.

COLIN	O-- Okay!

COLIN	Yes. 

COLIN	Yes, it was there, I'm positive.

JASPER	Okay.

COLIN	What about it?

JASPER	Okay, all right. So listen. If...if you had the prototype, and...and you don't have it...you don't have it now...then that means, it must have been there then, that night.

COLIN	Of course.

JASPER	Yes.

COLIN	The government. No, the government.

COLIN	If...if they knew of a working prototype, then they would want to steal it. They wouldn't want another one around.

JASPER	Exactly. 

JASPER	Okay, Colin, listen to me. Somehow, you're living in two different dimensions, okay? And you're communicating with yourself. We can use that.

COLIN	We...we...we can use what? What are you talking about?

JASPER	Okay. You have to get a message to yourself.

COLIN	What? I mean-- Get a message? How...how am I going to do that?

JASPER	Okay.

JASPER	Theoretically, if you're having these visions, then that means that you're communicating to yourself subconsciously.

COLIN	Subconsciously?

JASPER	Okay, all right. Okay, this is very, very important, okay? Colin, you have to get the fuel cell to the test facility.

JASPER	We don't have a lot of time. If we can get it there, then we can...

JASPER	...repeat the test. We can actually open up the wormhole...

JASPER	...and send the Earth back through it.

COLIN	Whoa, whoa, whoa. They were performing the testing that night. Wouldn't the whole place be surrounded by government agents?

JASPER	Yeah, of course it would.

COLIN	Great.

JASPER	No, see, that's okay, because it's the last place that they would expect you to take it. Okay, Colin, listen to me.

JASPER	When do you most have these visions?

COLIN	Ah...When I'm knocked out or coming to.

JASPER	Of course. Of course. Okay, all right, listen, you need to get this message to yourself. You need to say this, okay? Get the prototype, take it to the facility. Can you say that?

COLIN	Get the prototype, take it to the facility. How does that help us?

JASPER	Just say it with me.

JASPER & COLIN	Get the prototype, take it to the facility.

JASPER	Good. Say it one more time.

COLIN	Get the prototype, take it to the--

ZOEY	(gasps)

ZOEY	We have reached a whole new level of crazy.

JASPER	Oh, God. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

COLIN	"Get the fuel cell."

COLIN	Prototype. 

COLIN	Take it to the facility.

PENELOPE	Are you okay? I was worried. People were looking for you.

COLIN	I'm fine. Where's Danny?

PENELOPE	I don't know. I haven't seen him.

PENELOPE	Look, why don't you just relax and enjoy the evening?

COLIN	I can't.

COLIN	Please don't do anything and just act normal.

PENELOPE	What are you doing?

COLIN	I don't know.

PENELOPE	Colin!

NADIA	Colin. Colin

NADIA	You put him in a coma.

JASPER	No.

JASPER	Listen. Leave him alone, okay? The longer he's out, the better of a chance we have.

NADIA	Oh, that makes sense.

JASPER	Yeah, it...it does to me, okay? (sigh) You know what? I need a minute. I need a minute.

ZOEY	It's not safe here for long.

ZOEY	That sun is getting closer.

JASPER	We're not safe anywhere...

JASPER	...for long. The sun is gonna fry us all, and soon.

ZOEY	You really think this...

ZOEY	...is gonna work?

JASPER	I don't know.

JASPER	Maybe. And don't tell them that.

JASPER	Why do you ask?

ZOEY		I don't know.

ZOEY	In a crazy, weird way, things are actually better for me now than before it happened.

JASPER	(sighs)

NADIA	Colin. Colin. Colin!

NADIA	Yes. There you go. He's awake!

COLIN	Agh. I feel like I got hit by a truck.

JASPER	Hey. Hey. 

JASPER		Hey.

COLIN	What?

JASPER	Did you see anything?

COLIN	What? What?

COLIN	Ah...Yeah. I was...I was at the party (chuckles) and they were shooting at me.

JASPER	Okay. What...what about the fuel cell? Do you remember anything about that?

COLIN	(chuckles) Why do you think they were shooting at me?

JASPER	(gasps with joy)

JASPER	Mother of all mind trips.

JASPER	It freaking worked!

COLIN	Yeah, it worked. Now what?

JASPER	I was hoping, I guess the back-up generators wouldn't be working at the facility. I was hoping to get enough gas to power them now, but...

JASPER	...I've been too busy and concerned with this.

COLIN	A fuel cell from scratch? 

JASPER	I had to try something, man. 

JASPER	But...but now...now...now, a...

JASPER	... fully operational prototype is within our reach.

COLIN	Yeah, with some...inter-dimensional telepathy across space and time. Yeah, sure. Sounds….sounds great.

NADIA	And no power.

COLIN	That, too.

JASPER	Gas. We just need gas. We need to get gas.

ZOEY	Yeah, let's just go back to city, huh?

JASPER	(growls)

COLIN	No. A...ah...de---  A Radio...radio. Short wave or Ham.

JASPER	Yeah, what about them?

COLIN	Do you have one?

JASPER	Yeah, of course I do.

COLIN	Right. Get that baby up and running. I've got an idea.

COLIN	(reading) "Hate. Kid younger. Wife should be brunette or redhead"?

COLIN	Ugh! I can't believe it!

NADIA	What can't you believe?

COLIN	Since I lost my memory, nothing has been real. I have been chasing after a wife I don't have and a kid who doesn't exist.

COLIN	They're models. Models for the brochure.

COLIN	It was a memory I manufactured.

COLIN	I wake up in this hell that I created...

COLIN	...and the one, the one memory that had any meaning to me, isn't real!

COLIN	 I can't do this. I can't do this.

NADIA	Colin. Colin. Colin.

COLIN	What?

NADIA	I'm real. Zoey's real. Jasper is real. This whole thing is real. We're all in this together. You know, you weren't the only one that the event changed.
NADIA	You know Zoey? She was a runaway.

NADIA	My fiancé broke up with me the night of the event, about a block away from your building. I ran outside to get a cab and that's when that little rat tried to steal my purse.

ZOEY	You stole my cab.

NADIA	Anyway, there was a flash of light. You know what happened next. And we've been together ever since.

COLIN	(sighs) Sorry. 

NADIA	Don't say you're sorry. Come on, quit the pity party. You can do this, Colin.

NADIA	You can do this.

JASPER	Oh, I hate to break up this beautiful moment, but I've got one Ham radio at your service.

SARAH	Everyone please stay calm! It's going to be okay!

COLIN	(over radio) (garbled static)

COLIN	(into radio) Brennen. Can anyone hear me?

COLIN	(over radio) (garbled static)

COLIN	(over radio) (garbled static)

COLIN	(into radio) Please, if you can hear me.

JASPER	Come on, Colin, this is our only chance. You have to keep trying.

COLIN	(into radio) This is Colin Prite. Grant 127, do you copy? I repeat, this is Colin Prite. Sarah, please, if you can hear me.

COLIN		This is useless.

SARAH	(over radio) This is Sarah at Grant 127.

COLIN	(into radio) Sarah, thank God.

COLIN	(over radio) Listen to me.

SARAH	(into radio) Who's this?

COLIN	(over radio) It's Colin.

SARAH	Jack!

SARAH	Get in here! It's Colin. He's alive. (into radio) Colin, are you okay?

COLIN		(over radio) I'm fine. Look, it's a long story...

COLIN	(into radio) and I wish I had time to explain. 

COLIN	(over radio) I need your help.

SARAH	(into radio) What's going on?

COLIN	(into radio) I need gas.

BRENNEN	(over radio) You... (ON) and half the world, man!

COLIN	(into radio) Listen, I need you to trust me on this. I don't have time to explain everything. (OFF) All the gas you have, we need it.

JACK	(into radio) Colin, this is Jack. (OFF) We're getting hammered over here by a storm. That is absolutely impossible.

COLIN	(into radio) Listen to me.(OFF) I know this sounds crazy, but we can fix this. The wormhole, I can send us back through. But you are going to have to trust me.

SARAH	(into radio) Us going back through that wormhole is a rumor...

SARAH	(over radio) ...Colin.

COLIN	(into radio) No, it's not! And the only way you'll see that is if (OFF) you give me a chance.

JACK	(into radio) Colin. Colin. That gas (OFF) we use to save people's lives.

COLIN	(into radio) How many lives? (OFF) 20? 50? 100? (ON) I'm talking about saving everybody.

BRENNEN	(into radio) Look, if he's wrong...

BRENNEN	(into radio) ...that is it, okay? That's it, we're toast!

SARAH	(sighs)

SARAH	(over radio) Maybe you're still a little bit confused, Colin. No offense.

COLIN	(into radio) I have never been more clear. (OFF) I can do this. All the gas you have, we need to load it up (ON) get it to the Fuel X Corp. facility. (OFF) It's on the outskirts of town (ON) just past the 10, on Firestone.

COLIN	(over radio) This is our one and only chance. (ON) I need you to trust me.

COLIN	No, no, no, no, no.

NADIA	What happened?

COLIN	We lost them.

ZOEY	That didn't sound good.

JASPER	You think they're gonna do it?

NADIA	I think a better question is, did they make it?

JACK	Easy. Easy. Easy. What if he's right? What if he's right?

COLIN	I don't know. Are you sure there's no other way to get that facility operational?

JASPER	I guess we're gonna find out.

JACK	We all know who he is. 

JACK	What his company was working on.

JACK	What are we doing but simply prolonging the inevitable? I mean, really, what do we have to lose?

SARAH	Are you serious?

JACK	I'd rather have hope... hope in a real future, hope in a real future instead of waiting for our inevitable demise! Come on! I don't care what he says. I don't care whether he's right or if he's wrong.

SURVIVOR	We gotta move now, guys!

SURVIVOR	This place is coming down!

SARAH	Let's go. Let's go. Go.

JACK	Everyone! Get to the bunker!

SARAH	Move, move, move! It's not safe!

BRENNEN	Come on! Let's go, come on!

SARAH	All right, guys, we gotta go!

JACK	Let's go. Come on, everybody, it's gonna blow!

SARAH	Here we go!

SARAH	Here we go!

COLIN	Great. How the heck are we gonna make it through that?

SECURITY AGENT	Hey! Stop! Hey!

SECURITY AGENT	(into radio) On the bike, headed south!

NADIA	You guys.

JASPER		Oh, God.

ZOEY	Oh, my God.

COLIN	Oh, my God! Watch out! Watch out!

NADIA	(screams)

COLIN	Watch out!

COLIN	Hey, you okay?

NADIA	Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

COLIN	Hey, Jasper. Oh, God. Jasper.

COLIN	Oh, yeah. Come on. 

COLIN	Come on. God.

COLIN	I got you. Okay, okay, okay.

JASPER	(moans)

COLIN	Put your head back. Put your head back.

JASPER	(moans) Listen to me.

JASPER	I'm not gonna make it.

COLIN	No, no, no.

COLIN	We'll get you some help.

JASPER	You have to get the facility up and running.

COLIN		How? How am I gonna do that without you?

JASPER	It's gonna be easy. (coughs)

JASPER	The gas generators will power the capacitor. (coughs) The capacitor will get the facility up and running. And the fuel cell will take care of the rest. It self-generates power.

JASPER	(coughs) And lots of it. (coughs) This wasn't fun, Colin. Let's not do this again.

COLIN	Jasper...

COLIN	Oh, God.

COLIN	Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jasper.

JASPER	(coughs)

COLIN	Jasper?	

COLIN	Jasper? Jasper! Jasper!

COLIN	Get the gun.

COLIN	Come on.

NADIA	Where's this fuel cell?

COLIN	It's in here somewhere.

COLIN	Where? Where? Where? Where?

COLIN	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

SECURITY GUY	Hey! Stop!

AGENT	Where's the prototype?

COLIN	I don't know.

AGENT	Where's the prototype?

DANNY	Hello, Colin.

COLIN	Dad.
DANNY	Your father...

DANNY	...didn't he die penniless?

DANNY	Piss it all away...

DANNY	...chasing his foolish dreams?

COLIN	I'm not selling.

COLIN	I don't want them turning this into a weapon.

DANNY	Where is it?

COLIN	You thieving son of a bitch!

DANNY	How's that feel, huh? Where's the prototype? It's not in here!

COLIN	Put it in the bag!

DANNY	Okay, okay. Don't shoot!

DANNY	Stop him!

DANNY	Stop him now!

COLIN	Dan, you have to stop the test. You're going to destroy everything.

DANNY	The test is progress.

COLIN	I have a working prototype.

COLIN	Did you do that?

DANNY	You know where the real money lies.

DANNY	 We can sell this to the government, double our money, and not have to worry about the little stuff.

COLIN		Danny, I'm not selling. I don't want them turning this into a weapon.

DANNY	Whatever.

DANNY	You're making a mistake.

COLIN	Danny, when we roll out these fuel cells--

DANNY	I can't wait for them to roll out! I need money, Colin! I need it now!

COLIN	That enough to get started?

DANNY	It'll help.

COLIN	You have no idea what this is going to do!

DANNY	Looks like I gotta go. You see, there's gonna be a big show, and I got a front row seat. But when I return, you're gonna give me that fuel cell.

DANNY	(chuckles) Don't make a mistake...

DANNY	...you're gonna regret the rest of your life.

COLIN	Give me the bag!

DANNY	Okay.

COLIN	Being in business with you, that's my only regret.

AGENT	Where is it?

COLIN	Wait, wait, wait, wait.

COLIN	It's in here.

COLIN	Drop it! Drop it, I swear to God! Drop it!

AGENT	Hey! Stop!

COLIN	(chuckles)

COLIN	Drop it, I swear to God! Drop it!

COLIN	Keys. Keys, come on!

COLIN	We need power.

JACK	Colin!

COLIN		Wait, did you hear that?

COLIN	Sarah?

SARAH	Colin!

COLIN	Yes. It's not over.
	
JACK	Colin!

OLIN	Oh, thank God!

BRENNEN	Man, I'm so damn tired of saving your ass, kid.

COLIN	Only one more time. Come on.

BRENNEN	All right.

COLIN	All right, let's go. We gotta hurry. 

COLIN	Back-up generator's in here. Hurry! Come on! We need to power this place up. Let's go.

DANNY	Initiate the system.

LAB ASSISTANT	Copy. System initiating.

JACK	Where's the generator?

COLIN	It's in here. It's in here. It's in here.

JACK	Is this it?

COLIN	Corner! 

COLIN	Corner! Right over there. That's it. All right, gas in right now. Let's go. Let's go.

SARAH	All right, what about the fuel cell?

COLIN	I gotta get down to the main centrifuge. But I need power first.

BRENNEN	So this is gonna...

BRENNEN	...power this place and open a wormhole, huh?

COLIN	That's the plan.

BRENNEN	Damn!

COLIN	All right, come on, come on, come on! It's good. It's good. Cap it off. Cap it off. All right, come on.

SARAH	Come on!

COLIN	Okay.

BRENNEN	Easy.

COLIN	Please, please, please. Come on, please.

BRENNEN	Come on!

GROUP IN UNISON	Yes! Yeah!

COLIN	All right, let's go! We gotta go! We gotta hurry!

COLIN	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

BRENNEN	Hey, hey, hey, hey, ho!

COLIN	All right, we're looking for a lab.

BRENNEN	Okay, I'm gonna go this way.

COLIN	Danny!

COLIN	Stop the test!

BRENNEN	Hey. That's it! There's the lab!

SARAH	Brennen, e-cloud! Watch out!

JACK	Go, go, go! Get him!

BRENNEN	(screams in pain!)

SARAH	Hey!

COLIN	Brennen.

SARAH	You okay?

COLIN	Stay with him!

JACK	Get out of here.
	
COLIN	Stay with him!

JACK	All right, go.

COLIN	Stay out here! Don't follow me in!

DANNY	What's happening?

LAB ASSISTANT	I don't know.

DANNY	What do you mean you don't know? Shut it down!

LAB ASSISTANT	I can't!

DANNY	What do you mean you can't!

COLIN	Danny!

DANNY	Shut it down!

LAB ASSISTANT	I can't!

JACK	Colin...

JACK	...hurry up! We're in a coffin here!

COLIN	It's booting up!

COLIN	Initiating!

DANNY	 Shut it down!

LAB ASSISTANT	I'm trying! It's not responding!

DANNY	Shut it down!

NADIA	Colin!

JACK	Colin! He's down! Let's go!


JACK	Come on!

SARAH	What happened?

JACK	Nothing. Nothing happened.

JACK	It didn't work.

JACK	It's over.

NADIA	(sobs)

JACK	It's over.

COLIN	I tried, guys. I tried.

JACK	Everybody! Hold on!

CROWD	Happy New Year!

PENELOPE	Happy New Year, Mr. Prite.

COLIN	You, too, Penelope.

PENELOPE	Not enjoying yourself?

COLIN	Are you?

PENELOPE	I like parties. You know, your father would be proud, right?

COLIN	Thank you.

COLIN	That means a lot to me.

PENELOPE	Did you just thank me? (chuckles)

PENELOPE	You still wanna replace her?

PENELOPE	She's your wife, after all.

COLIN	She's fine. (long beat) She's not my wife.

DANNY	Colin! Happy New Year...

DANNY	...bud. Hope this is the year we get that government contract, huh?

COLIN	Hey, Danny?

DANNY	Yeah.

COLIN	Happy New Year. You're fired.

PENELOPE	Colin, is everything all right?
	
PENELOPE	Mr. Prite!

NADIA	I'm going to Koreatown.

NADIA	Whoa! That's my purse!

ZOEY	Let go!

COLIN	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

NADIA	What are you doing?

COLIN	Zoey, give her her purse back.

ZOEY	Who are you?

COLIN	Thank you. 

ZOEY	What?

COLIN	(to Nadia) Nadia.

NADIA	Thank you.

COLIN	Yeah. Hop in the cab.

ZOEY	Where are we going?

NADIA	What's going on?

COLIN	(chuckles) Trust me. It's a long story.

COLIN	Hop in the cab.

NADIA	Don't I know you?

COLIN	Sort of.

COLIN	I'll explain. Come on.

COLIN	Come on.

COLIN	Happy New Year's.

NADIA	So, who are you really?

ZOEY	And how do you know us?

COLIN	Like I said, it's a long story.
