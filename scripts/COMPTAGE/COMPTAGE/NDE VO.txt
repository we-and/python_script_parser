JULIE			Andy, are you ready? Get up here.

ANDY			I'm done with my boat, Mom.

JULIE			We're gonna be late to the airport. Please bring your bag down.

ANDY			I can't find it!

JULIE 			Did you look under your bed?

JULIE			What are you doing up there?		
		
JULIE			Babe, you got the passports?		

KEVIN			Yeah, I got 'em.		
		
ANDY			Daddy, Daddy, look.	

KEVIN			Oh, yeah, it looks good. The sail looks great. You almost got it.		
		
KEVIN			That's good. I checked the weather. Not a drop of rain all week.		
		
JULIE			I know. That's great.		

KEVIN			Hello?		

JULIE		Can you take the luggage outside, please?	 Andy, where's your bag? Andy Where's your bag, sweetie?		

KEVIN		Yeah, I saw the X-ray. Well, schedule an MRI, and let's just wait to see what the results of the blood test are, and we'll talk next week, okay? Email me his results. Yeah, thank you. All right.		

ANDY			Daddy.		

KEVIN			Yeah?		

ANDY		Are we gonna go on jet skis? Because Colin said he went on a lake, and his dad let him drive a jet ski.		

KEVIN			Six-year-old Colin rode a jet ski by himself?		

ANDY		He went 100 miles per hour! And he also said that his dad can kick your ass because you're a doctor.		

KEVIN		First of all, do not repeat bad words after Colin. Secondly, doctors are pretty tough.	You'd be surprised. And I highly doubt Colin rode a jet ski by himself.	

ANDY		Then promise me we will go together then.		

KEVIN		I promise.		

LUCAS		Kevin, Andy!	So, you're finally leaving.		

KEVIN		Lucas, yeah. Jules found a really good deal in the Caribbean.		
		We're gonna spend some quality time with the family.		
		
LUCAS		Well, that's what vacations are for.	 And only because of you, Margie and I were able to spend	our last vacation together.	

KEVIN		I know, I know. It's okay. You don't have to thank me.		
		
LUCAS		By the way, Julie mentioned you can't start the lawnmower again. I'll tell you what, I could show you how to fix it. It's simple. It'll only take a second.		
LUCAS		It's a small-- And they're all the same.		

KEVIN		No.		

KEVIN		I-- I'm on vacation.	I'm not fixing anything right now.	

LUCAS		Andy, your father can fix a human heart but he can't fix the lawnmower. Be careful. Some areas are not very safe out there.		

KEVIN		Thanks, Lucas, I'll keep that in mind.		

LUCAS		Toodle-loo.		

KEVIN		Have a nice week.		

LUCAS		Kevin! Slip the concierge a little something extra. He'll upgrade your room. Money, uh...That's how everything works	down there.		

KEVIN		Okay. Thanks.		

LUCAS		Au revoir.		

ANDY		Daddy, what's a concierge?		

ANDY		Daddy, is Treasure Island real?		
		
KEVIN		Yeah, for sure. Hundreds of years ago pirates used to hide treasure on deserted islands.		

ANDY		Why?		

KEVIN		So no one else could figure out where they hid it.			

ANDY		Why didn't they keep their treasure at home with their families?		

KEVIN		Pirates don't have homes or families.		

ANDY		If they didn't have homes or family, why did they need treasure?		

KEVIN		That's a good question.	

KEVIN		Hey. Come here!		

JULIE		What do you think? It's pretty amazing.		

KEVIN		It's pretty good. Yeah.		

CONCIERGE		Welcome!		

KEVIN		Hi.		

CONCIERGE		May I have your name and reservation number?		

KEVIN		Kevin Riley.	

KEVIN		I don't think I'm really particularly good at this, but if you were willing to upgrade our room, I would be willing to compensate you personally, financially.		
CONCIERGE		Certainly. Let's see what we have available.		
		
KEVIN			Thanks, man.

KEVIN		So what do you think of the honeymoon suite?		
		
JULIE		It's pretty great. Nice to finally see one.		

KEVIN		Oh, come on. Our honeymoon suite was nice.		

JULIE		I'm sorry, our honeymoon suite, did you just say? Our honeymoon suite was		a tiny bed in the back of an RV on the way to Mexico.		

KEVIN		So?		

KEVIN		That sounds like fun. It was great.	

JULIE		It was the worst trip ever.		

KEVIN		I thought it was fun.		
		
JULIE		I know you did. I love you.

KEVIN	Hi there.		

RENTAL ATTENDANT		Good morning. How you doing?		

KEVIN		Good. How are you?		

RENTAL ATTENDANT		I'm good, I'm good. How can I help you today?		

KEVIN		I want to get a jet ski, please.		

RENTAL ATTENDANT		Man, uh... yeah, I'm sorry, but we're all out for today. You know, the list is full. I'm sorry. Actually, if you can give me your name, I can book you for tomorrow.		
KEVIN			I get it. That's cool.		
		
RENTAL ATTENDANT		Sir, sir, we don't have any jet skis.		
		
KEVIN		Okay, my son,	 he's never been on one before, and I swear to you, it's all he talks about.	If there's anything that you could do, it would be great. It would mean a lot to me.		

RENTAL ATTENDANT		I'm not even supposed to tell you this, but you can rent a motorboat from one of the locals. A couple of kilometers down, you'll see a bunch of guys, and they have all kinds of boat, all right?		
		
BOY		Hey, mister!	

KEVIN			What you got there?		

BOY		Five-dollar fish.		

KEVIN		No, thanks. Nice fish though.		

BOATMAN #1		Yo, my friend! You need a boat?		
		
KEVIN		Yeah.		
		
BOATMAN #1	Only 300, bro.		

KEVIN		Which one?		

BOATMAN #1		Right there, the white one.												
BOATMAN #2	Right here, my man,	it's the fastest boat is right here.		

BOATMAN #1		Yeah, right. Give me 250.		
		
BOATMAN #2	Three hours for $200. Come here, you gonna like it. Right here, come on.		
BOATMAN #1	Just give me 250.		

KEVIN		He says 200.		

BOATMAN #2		Fun boat. You're gonna love it.	

BOATMAN #1		Go ahead.		

KEVIN		Thanks, man.		
		
KEVIN			I like this one.		

BOATMAN #2		How you doing, sir?		

KEVIN		I'm good. How are you?		

BOATMAN #2		Fine. This is a good boat. This is the fastest boat ever, okay? That engine right there, 60 horsepower. It came from a old sport boat. Just $200 for three hours.	Cash, please. Thank you very much.		

KEVIN		You need my license?		

BOATMAN #2		Get in, come on. No, man. I don't need your license, come on. What, you gonna steal my boat?		

KEVIN		Maybe.		

BOATMAN #2		You can take it. I'll get insurance money. Don't worry, man. Just bring it clean, and I'm not gonna charge you a cleaning fee. Sit down. I'm gonna show you how it works, okay? Okay, very simple, okay? Put the gear in drive,	and you're gonna put the throttle control lever up, and that's it, you're ready to go. You got the life vests right there, okay, and make sure if you got kids, put them on. You got a full tank of gas. Be safe.	Remember, if you go swimming, remember to drop the anchor. 'Cause when you come back, you're not gonna see the boat again, okay? Have a good trip!	

KEVIN		You can steer it. Here we go.		

JULIE		Hey!		

KEVIN		Yeah?		

JULIE		Where did you find this thing?		

KEVIN		They didn't have any jet skis, but the good thing is, this is safer, and we're all together. Right? [women yelling]		
		
ANDY		Wow!

KEVIN		Oh, I see how it is. These guys think they can take us, huh? What do you say we show 'em what we can do?		

KEVIN		Buckle up!		

JULIE		Do it!		

ANDY		Yeah! Faster, Daddy, faster!	 [Kevin laughs] [Julie screams]		

KEVIN	Bet you Colin never went this fast.	

JULIE		Kevin. Kevin!		

KEVIN		Yeah?

JULIE	Slow down!		
		
KEVIN			Okay.		

JULIE		Babe, listen, I think we should go back. We can't even see the land anymore.		
ANDY		No!		

KEVIN		Yeah.		

KEVIN		We got two hours left. Come on.		

JULIE		I think it's gonna take us a while to get back. We should turn around.		

KEVIN	All right. Your mom is right.	 Let's turn this baby around, and we'll cruise around	closer to shore, okay?
		
ANDY		No!		

JULIE		I know, buddy. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a party pooper. It's safer.		

ANDY		Island! Island! I wanna see the island! Daddy, Treasure Island!		

JULIE		I don't think it's a good idea.	

ANDY		Mom, just for a minute. Can we see the island?		

KEVIN		What do you say, Mom? Not every day you get to see a deserted island. Why don't we just check it out? We'll go home and have lunch after.		

ANDY		Yeah! Mom, please, please, please?		
		
JULIE		[chuckles] Okay.		

ANDY		Yeah! Full speed ahead! Next stop, Treasure Island!		
		
ANDY			Daddy, look, palm trees.		

JULIE		They're everywhere.		

KEVIN		Awesome.		

JULIE		Your ears are red.		

ANDY		Dad, you think there's treasure here?		

KEVIN		You never know. You guys wanna take a walk around the island?		

JULIE	I think I'm gonna sit down and read for a little bit. You guys go ahead.		

KEVIN		All right.		

ANDY		Let's look for buried treasure.		

KEVIN		Well, let's do it. Come on.	

JULIE		You boys have fun.		

KEVIN		Let's do it. Come on. Let's find some treasure.		
		
KEVIN		What do you think, huh?		

ANDY		Awesome.		

KEVIN		Let's go see this thing, Let's see if we can make it all the way around.		

ANDY		Cool!

ANDY		Whoa! A seashell! Dad, look.		

KEVIN		Wow. That's pretty cool. Take a look inside, see if anybody's home.		
		
JULIE		Hello, darlings.

ANDY		Look, Mom, we found a cool seashell.		

JULIE		Oh, a conk shell. It's good luck, you know.	 Conk. Can you say conk?		
	
ANDY		Conk.		

JULIE	Conk shell. It's good luck. You ready?		

KEVIN		I'm hungry.		

JULIE		I'm hungry too.		

KEVIN		Let me help you up. Who wants sushi?		

JULIE		I want sushi.		

KEVIN		Okay. How about a...	What do you say we get Mom a caterpillar roll?		

JULIE, ANDY		Eww!		

KEVIN		Or a spider roll.		

ANDY		What about a tarantula roll?		

KEVIN		What? No, those are too hairy. I don't like those.	How about some, uh... start with some miso chorizo?		

JULIE		Miso chorizo?		

KEVIN	Or some edamame salami?		

ANDY		I don't think there's	a crab there coming out.		

JULIE		What's going on over there, hon? We run out of gas?		
		
KEVIN		No, it's full.		

JULIE		Okay.

KEVIN		The thing is supposed to be down.		

KEVIN		All right, come on. Come on.		
		
KEVIN		Come on, come on, come on.		

KEVIN		I mean, anyways, if anything, there's... there's got to be a bunch of boats around.		
KEVIN		Let me check.	 There we go.	 It's basically a lawnmower engine.		
		
KEVIN		Fuck. Come on, come on.												
JULIE		It won't be much longer, honey.		
		
JULIE		All right, so how long do you think	 before they notice the boat is missing, and they come looking for us?		

KEVIN		I don't know if they care if their boat is missing. I rented it from a local, paid in cash. He doesn't know my name or where we're staying.		

JULIE		And he wouldn't want to report his missing boat to the police?		

KEVIN		I hope he does. Look, if it comes down to it, I'll put on a life vest and I'll swim back.		

JULIE		You can't swim back. It took us an hour going whatever miles per hour we were doing to get out here. Can you even imagine how far out we are?		
		
JULIE		I'm gonna keep looking for boats on the other side.	

JULIE		Hey. You okay?		

KEVIN		Only the battery's dead. I've been messing with the engine all morning, and it seems fine. The fuel line's good. We've got fuel.  The engine's just, I don't know. I think it's the battery that's dead. I went around the island. I didn't see any water. I did see a boat a little while ago.		

ANDY	Mommy! My head hurts, and I'm thirsty.		

JULIE		I know, sweetheart, but you have to stay out of the sun,	 Your father's asked you twice to stay out of the sun.	

ANDY		Hey, chief. Everything's gonna be fine. Just like in the pirate stories. Did you know that when they used to sail these seas, they would go for	 weeks at a time without food? And they didn't mind because it was an adventure, just like it is for us. So I want you to do what your mom says,	and I want you to stay under that tree and out of the sun,	 and I want you to think about what you're gonna tell Colin about your big adventure on Treasure Island, okay? Okay? Look. Boat! Boat. Boat! Hey! Babe, boat! Yo!		
		
JULIE		Hey!		

KEVIN		Help!		

JULIE		Hey!		

KEVIN		Hey!		

JULIE		Hey!

KEVIN		Whoo! Help!		
		
JULIE			Help!		

KEVIN		Stop!		
		
KEVIN		Help!		

JULIE		Help us!		

KEVIN		Hey! Whoo! Help!		

JULIE		We need help!		
KEVIN		No!

KEVIN	Help! Hey!		

JULIE		Look over here!		

KEVIN		Hey! Whoo!		
		
KEVIN		It's okay. There's gonna be plenty more. That's just one. A boat is gonna come along,and they're gonna get us, okay? Now in the meantime, you get under that palm tree. Stay out of the sun.		

JULIE		What are we gonna do?		

KEVIN		Well, we can last a couple of days without food. Someone's guaranteed to come by then.		

JULIE		How long can we last without water?	

JULIE	I can't believe	 this is actually happening. Hey. I know I've been too hard on you. I'm sorry., Do you really think we're gonna be okay?		

KEVIN		Of course we're gonna be okay.		
				
KEVIN		I will not let us die out here. That's a promise.		
		
KEVIN	Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules, you got to wake up. His heart is racing.	 He's overcompensating 'cause he can't pump the blood properly.		

JULIE		Andy. Andy!		
		
JULIE		Damn it! Goddamn it!		

JULIE		Please don't let him die. We have to do something.		

KEVIN		Hey, hey, hey, hey. We have to get off the island.	We have to get out on the water.	There are boats out there. Someone is gonna spot us. If we don't, he's not gonna wake up tomorrow. None of us will.		

KEVIN		Baby, I'm sorry. I love you.		

JULIE		I love you.		
		
KEVIN			Hello! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Hello! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
		
MIGUEL		Jorge!		

MIGUEL	 [Miguel speaking Spanish]		
		
KEVIN		My son and my wife, they need water.		
		
MIGUEL		Here. Here. Wet their lips.		

KEVIN		That's water?		

MIGUEL		It's fresh water.		
		
KEVIN		Jules. Come here. I got water. No, no, put it on her neck, put it on her neck. The skin is thin there. It'll suck in the moisture. I'm a doctor. Exactly. Now get her wrist, get her wrist.		

KEVIN		Come on. Water.		

MIGUEL		How long you been out here?		

KEVIN		Few days.		

MIGUEL		Days?		

KEVIN		Days.		

MIGUEL		What happened?		

KEVIN		We're staying at a resort, and I rented this boat, and then the engine just wouldn't start. Drifted out to sea and... But my son, I need to get him to the hospital. He won't last much longer. Please.		

MIGUEL		Let me take the kid.		

KEVIN		Come on, babe, we're going home.		

KEVIN		I'm Kevin. This is my wife Julie. I want to say we're gonna be forever grateful for what you've done for us.		

KEVIN		What is your name?		

MIGUEL		Listen, man, I want to help you. I want to save you and your family, okay?		
KEVIN		Okay.		

MIGUEL		But I would like a reward, you know. A compensation for saving your lives.		
KEVIN		Yes, of course, definitely. I swear to you, you'll be very happy.		

MIGUEL		Yeah, but I would like to agree on the price right now.		
		
KEVIN		Of course. Anything you want. Uh, ten... thousand. Ten thousand dollars, ten thousand dollars.		

KEVIN		Forty, forty. That's everything we have in our savings. I'll give you forty thousand dollars.		

MIGUEL		How much is your family's life worth? I want one million dollars.		
		

KEVIN		I don't have a million dollars.		

MIGUEL		But you're a doctor, right?		

KEVIN		Yes, I'm a doctor, but I work at a county hospital. We don't even make anything like that.		

MIGUEL		Listen, man, I have a family too. You all come here and spend $10,000 on one vacation. That's more than I made	this whole year! For four people! I need a million dollars or I'm leaving. Make up your mind.		

KEVIN		No. No, you can't leave us. You can't leave us. You can't be serious! We'll die out here! You said you have a family. I've offered you $40,000. $40,000. Isn't that enough?		

MIGUEL		Not for me.		

KEVIN		Wait, don't, don't.		

KEVIN		Don't. Please don't go.		

MIGUEL		One million dollars or no deal.		

KEVIN		Wait, wait, wait, wait You can't leave my family here!		
		
MIGUEL		One million dollars or no deal.		

KEVIN		I don't have a million dollars! My son is six years old, you motherfucker!		
MIGUEL		You can die here. Or we can go to town. Call one of your rich friends, get my money, and your family lives.		

KEVIN		I'll get money. Just get us off the island, and I'll get you a million dollars.		
MIGUEL		You sure?		

KEVIN		Yeah.		

MIGUEL		Good.		

MIGUEL		Wake up.		

KEVIN		Where's my wife and my son? My son?		

MIGUEL		Back on the island.		
		
KEVIN			Why? We agreed.		
		
MIGUEL		Listen to me.	We have to go to the bank and transfer the money, and then we go back to the island with the second boat, so you can get your family.		

KEVIN		But they don't have any water.		

MIGUEL		They had enough water. Listen carefully.	Think about your family. Your family is on the line. You do anything stupid, your family's gonna die, okay?		
		
KEVIN		Why are you doing this?		

MIGUEL		By the moment, they're gonna die.		
		
KEVIN		Shut the fuck up!		

MIGUEL		Don't do anything stupid. Don't tell the police or anyone else because if you do I won't tell anyone anything.	I will say this guy is a liar.		

KEVIN		Turn around, go back. please. Turn around and go back, please. I swear to God I'll still pay you the money.	Just take me back, please. I swear to God,	 I'll still give you the money.	I'll give you the money!		

MIGUEL		Let's make sure you do that.		

MIGUEL		So I'm in town, and I'm coming right now. Okay. All right. Just make sure you text me the account number right away. Yeah.	Okay, good.		
		
MIGUEL		All right. Don't mess with me, man. I'm on the way right now. Jorge!		

MIGUEL		Bye. There are thousands of islands back there. I am the only one who knows where your family is, so don't do anything stupid. Here.	 Clean up.		
		
KEVIN		Jimmy, it's Kevin. I'm in a lot of trouble. I need money today. I don't even have time to talk about this right now, but you have to do something for me immediately.	I can't tell you right now, It's about Andy and Julie. Just wire it.	 You have my bank info. Just get it to me. Put me in with Dr. Zett's office, please. Can't talk about it right now. I'm in a bad situation. What do you mean? 9-0-5-6-4-9-8-3. Hello, can you hear me? I need money.	 No, no. no. Get it to me now Richard, Richard, I've been waiting on the phone for you for ten minutes. Ten minutes I've been sitting here waiting for you. No, no, no, no. No, I cannot wait. I cannot wait!  [Kevin shouts]		

KEVIN		Get him on the phone. Get him on the phone! Fuck!		
		
KEVIN		Lucas! Lucas, it's Kevin. Can you hear me? Listen, I know that you always said that you wanted to repay me for what I did for Margie. Well, now's the day. Take me to the bank.		
		
BANK TELLER		How can I help you?		

KEVIN		I need to check my account.		

BANK TELLER		Can I have your card? Thank you, Mr. Riley.		

BANK TELLER		Anything else I can do for you today?		

BANK TELLER		Have a good day.		

MIGUEL		This wasn't the deal.		

KEVIN		You can either take that money now or you can take nothing. If you don't take my money, if you don't tell me where my wife and my child are, you're gonna be looking over your shoulder	 for the rest of your short, agonizing, miserable life	because I'm gonna take your face and break it in half with my hands,	you understand me?		

KEVIN		I need to know that we have a deal.		

MIGUEL		Transfer it.		

BANK TELLER		Anything else? Thank you.		
KEVIN		Hello again.		

BANK TELLER		Hi.		

KEVIN		I want to transfer to that account number, please.		
		
BANK TELLER		Whole amount?		

KEVIN		The entire balance.		

BANK TELLER		Sure thing.		
		
MIGUEL		Yeah. Wired two minutes ago. We're good.		

KEVIN		Okay, sure.		
		
MIGUEL		Jorge, prepare el otro bote.	Okay. Come.		
		
MIGUEL		You can follow us in this one.		

KEVIN		Hey, why are you locking me in?		
		
MIGUEL		For your own safety and everyone's, don't communicate with anyone.		
KEVIN	Open the door!		

MIGUEL		Listen! Listen!		

MIGUEL		When we get to the island,	I will let you out, but first you have to wait one hour after we leave,		

MIGUEL		then you leave.		

KEVIN		No!		
		
KEVIN			Open it up!		

MIGUEL		Don't worry.		

KEVIN		Hey, hey, I don't know how to get back! It's gonna be dark!		

MIGUEL		Okay, Jorge, let's go.		

KEVIN	Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? I gave you all that money! I swear on my son's life, I will never tell anyone about this! You got the money!		
		
MIGUEL		Jorge, back! Back! Go back!		
		
JORGE		Escucha!		

MIGUEL		Back!		

MIGUEL		I will tell you! Stay back!		

KEVIN		Please!		
JORGE		Hey!		

KEVIN		I paid you the money! I gave you everything I have! Why are you doing this? Please, just take me back to my family. I swear to God I'll never tell anybody!		
MIGUEL		I know you will tell your government!		

KEVIN		I won't tell anybody, I swear!		

MIGUEL		You'll tell your government, and they can look for me and arrest me.	You think I'm stupid? No.		

KEVIN		Aah! Just tell somebody! Please! Don't let them die! Don't you let them die! Please! Just tell somebody!	Do not leave my family on that island! Please! Don't you let them die!		

MAN ON BOAT		Hey! Grab the lifesaver! Grab it!		
		
WOMAN ON BOAT		He's got it!		

MAN ON BOAT		Pull him in! Pull him in now!		

WOMAN ON BOAT		Pull him in!		
		
HAAGEN		Mr. Riley. Detective Constable Haagen. We spoke on the phone. The US Embassy	has been notified, and the US Coast Guard captain will guide you through the rescue plan.		

HAAGEN		How's your leg?		

KEVIN		I'll live.		

COAST GUARD		Now we're right here, and these are the islands	where you most likely made your initial landfall,	and then you drifted at sea for at least one full day and night, more likely going north, northeast, following the prevailing currents. They move at about four, four and a half knots.	That potentially takes us out another 150 nautical miles from these islands. We have an initial search area.	It's about 2,000 square miles, roughly the same size as the state of Delaware, and inside that search area, there are hundreds of islands and keys. We can do this. It's just gonna take some time.		

KEVIN		Okay, realistically, how long to search the entire area?		

COAST GUARD 	A major search and rescue	operation like this can take weeks.		

KEVIN		Weeks? They're gonna be dead before the sun rises! Weeks?		
		
COAST GUARD 	Mr. Riley, the ships are in preparation to deploy in about three hours, and that's gonna put us at this first chain of islands just before dawn.		
		
KEVIN		Don't helicopters have lights?		

COAST GUARD 	Yeah, but it's virtually impossible to spot two unconscious people on an unknown island in the dark, even with night vision. There's nothing we can do right now.		
		

KEVIN		What about the fisherman?		

HAAGEN		We have to focus on your family, and then we'll find the fisherman.		

KEVIN		Why don't we go for the fisherman right now?		

HAAGEN		Let's talk alone, please.		
		
HAAGEN		How do you suppose we get this guy? You don't know his name, you don't know	the vessel hull number.		

KEVIN		I told you on the phone. His name is Jorge.		

HAAGEN		Jorge.	Listen, man, be realistic. Most likely, Jorge is a Cuban migrant. Most deckhands are immigrant workers with no records at all. I bet the fisherman	is a migrant himself.	 Probably Haitian.		

KEVIN		What about the bank?		

HAAGEN		We have the video. We're looking into the wire transaction and the receiving account as we speak. But this is the Caribbean. I'm sure you know that there's a lot of shady stuff going on in these banks.		
		
HAAGEN		Have you had any arguments with your wife lately?		

KEVIN		Why do you ask?		

HAAGEN		Does your wife or your son	have life insurance?		

KEVIN		No. Yes, with our credit union.		
		
HAAGEN		Where did all the money from your account come from?		

KEVIN		What difference does it make?		

HAAGEN		A big difference. You rented a boat from a local man away from the resort. You don't have a witness that saw your wife or your son get onto that boat Days later, you show up at a bank to complete a wire transfer to an offshore account,	accompanied by a mysterious fisherman.	Mr. Riley, is there actually a fisherman?	Is it possible that your family was not on the boat as you said?		
		
KEVIN		Are you serious? You're wondering if I'm lying?	You're wondering if I would do something to harm my six-year-old son and my wife? I don't know who the fisherman is but I know he left my wife and my son on an island to die. Right now they are dying of severe dehydration and thirst, unless we go out and save them.		
		
HAAGEN		You look exhausted.	You need to get some rest before the search start tomorrow. I'll take you back to the hotel.	We're going to find your family, Mr. Riley. We're going to find them.		

MIGUEL		I have a family too. Text me the account number. There are dozens of islands	back there. I am the only one who knows	 where your family is.		

KEVIN		Damn it.		
AMERICAN TOURIST		Checking out the scores? Yeah, me too. I tell you, it's the only thing that keeps me sane. Family has fun and whatnot and go to the beach and... But I've been stuck with my wife and the kids in the same hotel room for a week now, you know what I mean?	 Don't get me wrong. You know, it's a nice place.	 I like it here. The family does.		
		
KEVIN		You fish?		

AMERICAN TOURIST		Big game fishing. One of my favorite sports. I placed third in this one.	 I also fish marlin--		

KEVIN		What do you do with the fish after you catch them?		

AMERICAN TOURIST		Throw it back in or sell it.		

KEVIN		Who do you sell it to?		

AMERICAN TOURIST		Fish suppliers.		

KEVIN		Thank you.		

AMERICAN TOURIST		Hey, anytime.		
		
KEVIN		Detective, if this guy's a fisherman, then he has a buyer. He's got to have somebody that he sells his fish to regularly, and I think we can	 track him that way.		

HAAGEN		Do you know how much resources	 it would take to do that? And if by some miracle we do track him down through the buyer, there's no guarantee that the fisherman will talk in time to save your family.		

KEVIN		I'll make him talk.		

HAAGEN		The plan is to search and rescue. We do not have all the resources possible,	so you have to bear with us.		

SWEENEY		Let me jump in here. Mr. Riley, let me introduce myself. I'm Brian Sweeney.	I'm Deputy Chief of Mission, United States Embassy.	Can I have a word with you?		
HAAGEN		We're on the case, okay?		

SWEENEY		Look, I know the detective personally. He's a good man. He's been around the block. Let's let him find the fisherman, all right?	But in the meantime, I need every available resource out there	searching for your family, and that includes you. You have the 100% cooperation and backing of the United States Embassy.		
SWEENEY		Let them do their job.		

KEVIN		Thank you.		

SWEENEY		Okay?		

KEVIN		Thank you.		

HAAGEN		Mr. Riley!		

KEVIN		Yeah.		

HAAGEN		Don't go too far. They're expecting you at the base in an hour.		

KEVIN		I'm just gonna go up to my room.	I'll be back in a minute.		

HAAGEN		In an hour, Mr. Riley!		
		
KEVIN		Hey, can I get a taxi?		

VALET		[whistles] Taxi!		

KEVIN		Thank you.		
		
TAXI DRIVER		Where to, boss?		

KEVIN		Where do fishermen	 sell their fish around here?		

TAXI DRIVER		We can go to the market, if it's still open.		
		
KEVIN			Let's go.		

TAXI DRIVER		All right.		

KEVIN		Excuse me, I'm looking for a couple of fishermen that may be doing business here.	One is, uh, Haitian. He's really thin. He's probably 40 years old. Average height.	 Do you know somebody like that?		

MARKET EMPLOYEE		I don't know, but there's this guy named Roger.	He knows all of them. Maybe you can catch him at the loading dock. He drives a brown van.		

KEVIN		Thanks.		

KEVIN		Hey! Stop the van! Hey, stop! I'm sorry, man. I was told that you might be able to help me with something. I'm looking for a couple of fisherman	 who probably do business here. One is Haitian, and he's got a guy he works with. His name is Jorge. He's Latino. Does the name ring a bell?		

ROGER		No, man.		

KEVIN		What about the boat? Pretty rusty, antennas going--		

ROGER		I been doing this for 30 years. I would know. No one we deal with comes to mind.	How do you know those guys are here at the market? There are hundreds of boat	 on notice all over the islands.		
		
KEVIN		What if I were to hire somebody like a deckhand, you know, somebody to work on my boat for me, with me.		

ROGER		You can try the the harbor in the morning.		

KEVIN		Night fishing. What if I wanted to hire someone tonight? How would I do that?		
ROGER		If you are desperate,	 there's a bar by the harbor.	 They all hang out there. Easy.		
		
KEVIN		Guys, excuse me. I'm looking for a guy by the name of Jorge. Do you by any chance know--		

PATRON		What do you need?		

KEVIN		Deck hand for my boat.		

PATRON		Got a couple of guys here, you know?		

KEVIN		No, no, it's okay. I just want to hire the guy Jorge. Do you know him?		

PATRON		Yeah, that guy, blue shirt.		
		
KEVIN		Jorge!		

LATINO MAN		Yes?		
		
KEVIN			Sorry.		

HAAGEN		Haagen.		

KEVIN		Detective, are there any leads on the fisherman?		
		
HAAGEN		Where are you?		

HAAGEN		This is starting to look very suspicious. What are you not telling me?		
		
KEVIN		I cannot just sit on my ass and wait for the sun to come up.		

HAAGEN		I need you to tell me	where you are immediately.		

KEVIN		Okay, you call me if there's	any further developments.		
		
POLICEMAN		I'm telling you, my friend, something's going on.	From the first time I saw him, I know something was wrong.		

HAAGEN		Yeah.		

TAXI DRIVER		What's up, boss? Where to now?		

KEVIN		[sighs]	 I don't know.		
		
TAXI DRIVER		What you looking for, man?	 You want some girls?		
		
KEVIN			No. No girls.		

TAXI DRIVER		Okay.		

KEVIN		Hey, you know what? I'll give you 100 bucks... just to wait.		

TAXI DRIVER		No problem, man.		

KEVIN		Where'd you get that scar?		

TAXI DRIVER		I was cooking some swordfish, and a bone sliced it. Almost cut my finger off.		
KEVIN			Where did you get the sutures?		

TAXI DRIVER		What?		

KEVIN		Stitches. Who fixed you up?		

TAXI DRIVER		Oh, they did it at the hospital, man.		

KEVIN		Which one? How many are there around here?		

TAXI DRIVER		There's only one.		
		
KEVIN		Excuse me, I have a leg wound that is showing signs of infection.		

RECEPTIONIST		Please, first door.		

KEVIN		Thank you.		

RECEPTIONIST		Okay.		
		
KEVIN		Please listen to me. A few days ago, I took a boat ride with my family.	 We got stranded on an island, and a fisherman asked us for a lot of money to save us He took me back to the shore,	and he left my wife and my child on the island. After he received the money, he tried to drown me, and then he just disappeared.	My wife and my son are still out on that island, and they have severe dehydration right now. The fisherman is Haitian, about forty years old.		

KEVIN		He's very thin, really thin.		

DOCTOR		Sir, please.		

KEVIN		He's average height,	 but he's got a deep laceration on his inner tricep, and the sutures are fresh. They can't be more than a week old, and I think that he got them here. I need... I need his information. Look, look. I'm a doctor too.		
DOCTOR		Good. Then you should know I can't do that.		

KEVIN		I didn't come here for treatment. That man is the only person who knows where my wife and my son are.		

DOCTOR		I'm sorry, sir.		

KEVIN		Listen to me. The only person!		

DOCTOR		Sir, we can't give out any patient's information unless you're a police.	You should know that. You're a doctor, right?		
		
KEVIN		He'll never talk to the police. The only person he's gonna talk to is me. Look, that's my wife. That's us. That's my wife and my son. That's my wife and my son That man is the only person who knows where my wife and my son are. He's not gonna tell the police	anything. I need this information for myself.		

DOCTOR		Sorry, sir.		

KEVIN		Please.		

DOCTOR		I can't do that.		

KEVIN		Yes, you can.		

DOCTOR		I can't do that, but I'm going to step out for a minute, okay?		

KEVIN		Miguel Kaba.		
		
KEVIN			I got you, you son of a bitch.		
		
KEVIN		I want you to wait here. A man is going to come with me. If you don't ask any questions, I'm gonna give you another $100.		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		Who's this?		

KEVIN		I'm looking for Miguel.		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		Who's this?		

KEVIN		I need a man with a boat. I was told down in the marina	 by some guys that he's good, so I want to hire him.	 Go away! Go away now!		

KEVIN		I'm not gonna hurt you!		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		Do not touch my daughter!		

KEVIN		I need to know where Miguel is.		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		I don't know!		

KEVIN		I'm not gonna hurt your child or you. I just need to know where is Miguel.		
MIGUEL'S WIFE		I don't know! I say I don't know!		

KEVIN		I know he lives here!		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		Get back!		
		
KEVIN		What about Jorge?		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		I don't know!		

KEVIN		Where is Jorge? I know you know Jorge! Where is he?		
		
MIGUEL'S WIFE		I don't know, I don't know!		

KEVIN		Where is he? Where is he?		

KEVIN		Take me back there.		

MIGUEL		I don't know what you're talking about.		

KEVIN		Take me back there	right this fucking second. You kidnapped my wife and my son!		
		
MIGUEL		Fuck you.			
KEVIN		Take me back there!		

MIGUEL		Fuck you!		

KEVIN		Don't fuck with me. You have to take me back there! Take me back to my family! You done, huh?		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		Let him go! Now! Now!		

MIGUEL'S DAUGHTER		Papa?		
		
MIGUEL'S WIFE		Go back! Go back!		
		
MIGUEL		Hey! Let her go!		

KEVIN		Put that thing down!		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		You put her down!		
		
KEVIN		How does this feel? Put it down or	somebody's gonna get hurt!		

KEVIN		Put it down!		

MIGUEL		I'll put it down!		
		
KEVIN		Drop it, Miguel! You put it down!		

MIGUEL'S WIFE		No! No! No!		

MIGUEL		I'm gonna fucking kill you!		
		
MIGUEL		I'm gonna fucking kill you!		

HAAGEN		It's a gruesome scene at that house!		
		
KEVIN		That was self defense. Listen to me. I have the hull number. That means we can locate Jorge.		

HAAGEN		Mr. Riley, you're responsible for the murder of two people, including a little girl!		
KEVIN			That was an accident!		

HAAGEN		You're hereby held into custody. You held her at knifepoint before slitting her father's throat!		
		
KEVIN		No! I-I-I didn't kill her! I did not-- I'm innocent!		
		
HAAGEN		You transferred a large amount of money and were implicated	 in a double homicide after that!		

KEVIN		The fisherman made me transfer the money. There's a boat sunk in the sea What do you think I did? You think I tried to fake-drown myself in a boat?		

HAAGEN		It looks like you were involved in a money laundering scheme, or you paid the fisherman to get rid of your family	 and then you got rid of him!		

KEVIN		I'm not talking to you anymore. I'm talking to him.		
		
HAAGEN		Be my guest.		

KEVIN		Listen, I got the number for the boat.		

SWEENEY		You need to stop talking right now. This no longer a missing persons investigation.	 This is a double homicide. You need to get a lawyer.		

KEVIN		GPC9243.		

SWEENEY		Are you listening to me?		

KEVIN		That means we can get to Jorge. We can make him lead	the search party.		
SWEENEY		Mr. Riley, the search	has been called off.		

KEVIN		What?		

SWEENEY		The search is over.		

KEVIN		Why?		

SWEENEY		Because you're an American citizen who is in custody, and they think you murdered two of their nationals. That's why.		

KEVIN		You're gonna leave them out there to die?		

HAAGEN		It's not what I'm gonna do. Mr. Riley, there's nothing I can do! They no longer believe that your story is credible,	so they are calling off the search! You got to understand that this is a tourist nation, all right?	 They rely heavily on tourists.		
KEVIN		I don't give a fuck!		

SWEENEY		Okay, listen, the last thing they want is a media shit storm that they think is started by someone who they consider a murderer! So just take my advice--		
KEVIN		What do you think I'm doing?!		

SWEENEY		You have got to keep your mouth shut!		

KEVIN		No, we went to a hotel, we checked in, my wife and son,	 then we went on a ride--		
SWEENEY		I'm trying to help you. There's nothing else that I can do for you! Listen, my hands are tied. I am trying to help.		

KEVIN		What if you're wrong?		

SWEENEY	It doesn't matter.		

KEVIN		You're gonna have blood on your hands!		

SWEENEY		You are under investigation! You're about to get transferred! You are gonna get transferred to a secure facility, where you will receive medical treatment. Just take him away, please. Mr. Riley! Mr. Riley! Calm down! Jesus Christ!		

KEVIN		Get back! Get back!		
		
HAAGEN		Get back.		

KEVIN		Get back!		
		
KEVIN		Uncuff me.		

HAAGEN		Uncuff him.		

KEVIN		Get back!		

HAAGEN		Okay.		
		
KEVIN		I did not kill that girl! It was an accident! And my wife and my son are out there!		
HAAGEN		Kevin, I believe you!		

KEVIN			No, you don't.		

KEVIN		If you follow me... I'll shoot. I'll shoot.		
		
HAAGEN		Kevin!		

KEVIN		Good morning, guys.		

HARBOR CLERK		Good morning.		
		
KEVIN		I don't mean to be rude. I'm just in a real hurry.		

HARBOR CLERK		Yes?		

KEVIN		Last night, I was out with a couple guys, and they told me they're going shark fishing, and I've actually never been before, and I kind of missed them this morning, and I don't know where their boat is, so I kind of need to know where it's docked.		

HARBOR CLERK		I can't help you without a last name and a hull number.		

KEVIN		Miguel Kaba is his name, and he mentioned that	the hull number was GPC9243.		
HARBOR CLERK		Miguel Kaba, number C4400, slip 37, Compass King.		
		
KEVIN		How do I get there?		

HARBOR CLERK		Take the north ferry. About an hour from here.		

KEVIN		Thank you.		

HARBOR CLERK		Wait. Actually, the lease was terminated on this slip yesterday.		
		
KEVIN		Are you saying that the boat isn't there?		

HARBOR CLERK		That's right, man. Sorry, but your fishing trip might not happen after all. You know, you can rent a boat from one of the locals if you want.		

MAN PHONE		Everything is coming, I promise you. We'll go over everything in sight. I'll be back in the office in a couple hours.		

AMBER		United States Embassy. Yes. Sir, yes, please hold. Sir, sir. Sir!		

SWEENEY		What?		

AMBER		It's him. Line two.		

SWEENEY 	Mr. Riley.		

KEVIN		Jorge has a cell phone.		

SWEENEY		Mr. Riley, you have got to understand--		

KEVIN		The fisherman called Jorge on his phone when we left the bank.		

SWEENEY		Being on the run, you are making your case infinitely harder.		
		
KEVIN		Jorge definitely has a cell phone, so the only way I'm gonna give myself up is if you trace his calls, you get him, you bring him to main square at noon, and you have yourself, the police, and a translator. That's the only way I'm gonna give myself up, do you hear me?		

SWEENEY		Mr. Riley, I promise you, I'm gonna do everything in my power to help you out but I want you to do me one favor. Don't do anything rash, okay? Mr. Riley?	 Mr. Ri-- Amber!		

HAAGEN		Haagen.		

KEVIN		You think you can outsmart me?		

KEVIN		I told you I would give myself up, but only if you let me see Jorge. If you don't,	you're never gonna catch me.		

HAAGEN		We called Jorge's number. Whoever picked up got spooked. The signal disappeared. If it was Jorge, then he's probably on his way off the island for good. Kevin, I believe you, but you're wanted for murder. In order to help you,	I need you to turn yourself in. Otherwise, you're gonna spend the rest of your life running. KeviN. Kevin! Jorge?		
		
KEVIN		Jorge!	 Stop the bus.	 Stop! Stop the bus!		

KEVIN		Jorge, stop!		

WOMAN ON BUS		He's gonna jump.		
		
KEVIN			Jorge, stop! Jorge! Stop! Stop! Stop! Jorge! Jorge, stop! My family! Please!		
KEVIN			My family! Familia! Familia! Familia! Please, no, no policia! No policia! My family			Where is my family?	Please!		

KEVIN		Get back in your truck. Move it a few feet forward.		
		
KEVIN		Just a couple feet. That's it, that's it.		
		
KEVIN			Call for help.		

TRUCK DRIVER		I don't have a phone.		
		
KEVIN		Jorge, Jorge. Jorge. Where is my family? Look, where is my family? Are they here? Are they here, Look on this map. Where is my family? Which island? Which island? Jorge. Jorge! Jorge! You have to look! You have to look!		
		
KEVIN			Is it that one?	 Or is it this one? Which one is it?		

KEVIN		Where's the closest marina?		
		
KEVIN		I'm taking your truck.		
		
KEVIN		Where's the hospital?		

KEVIN		Help me get him in the truck. Take down the gate.		
		
KEVIN		Hey, hey, you take him to the hospital. Drive fast or he's gonna die.		

KEVIN	Sir! Can you take me to this island? I'll pay you. How long will it take us?		
OLD TIMER		I have to take her to fill up first. By nightfall if we're lucky.
