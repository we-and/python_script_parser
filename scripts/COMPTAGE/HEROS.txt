Buckwit	Oh. As I see you’re coming around. In case you don’t remember me, my name is… Buckwit. Normally I would just provide game tips for the players. But it looks like the tips alone are not going to be enough. I’ll have to offer you a full tutorial. Here we go

Buckwit	Welcome to the world of the video game  “Heroes of Envell.” This place is real, much more real than you think. Obstacles, enemies, weapons—all of that is real too. If you want to jump over an abyss, do it yourself. And you better not fail. The players can enter and exit the game through the portal. Only five people can be playing the game at the same time. The portal won’t let any intruder into the game. Now for the characters. Art, Vic, Phill, Kira, and… err… Mrs Norton. These four school students and their teacher accidentally found the portal and ended up in the game. Art, class - knight. Abilities: shotgun-sword, shield and double-jump boots. Vic, class - engineer. Abilities: crafting and repairing items. Phill, class - wizard. Ability to cast various spells. Kira, class - thief. Abilities: crossbow with different types of arrows and invisibility. 1Mrs Norton, class - bard. Abilities: supporting spells. And now we can get to the plot. Mourgarth is the game’s final boss. One day, Mourgarth realized that he doesn’t want to be a simple mob and decided to break out of the game and have his revenge. With the help of his minion, Salamandra, Mourgarth captured all previous players and turned them into chess pieces. According to the rules of the game, none of the mobs are allowed to use the portal. That’s why Mourgarth wants to find a valuable artifact, the Cheaters Cube. With its help, Mourgarth plans to change the rules of the game and get out of it. At the start of my explanation, the cube was in the hands of a game monster, Chupacabra. Chupacabra is willing to trade the cube for Creep, another monster from the game who’s also happens to be Kira’s beloved pet. Our five characters turned out to be the only ones who can stop Mourgarth. But before that, they had to solve several other problems. First, a whole bunch of monsters are after Kira. Second, which is even worse, she was transferred to another school

Vic	Why does Chupacabra need Creep?

Phill	What does it matter? If it’s the only way to get the cube back.

Mrs Norton	Maybe there’s some kind of spell for these situations?

Phill	There is. “Summon a monster”. But Kira is not picking up.

Vic	Art, did you get any word from her yet?

Art	Still no.

Phill	Try better! We need Creep!

Art	And Kira.

Karen	Who’s that texting you all the time?

Kira	Ugh. No one.

Karen	Anywho, we’ve created a fake account with a picture of the guy that Mary really likes and sent her a bunch of private messages as if from him. Here’s her receiving the first one.

Karen	Here’s her replying. And here she finds out it was a prank. Just look at her face!

Karen 	Oh! And this is when we poured glue in her purse!

Kira	That’s kind of harsh. She has just joined the class.

Karen	That’s right. There’s nothing as fun as playing pranks on newbies.

Marina	Is that him texting you again?

Kira	Possibly.

Karen	He must really like you. But do you like him back?

Kira	Me? No! No. I don’t like him at all.

Marina	In that case, let’s play a prank on him.

Kira	Err… No.

Karen	Kira. You have also just joined our class. You need to choose. Either you are with us, or expect glue in your purse. Ah! I got you! You should’ve seen your face! Pity I didn’t film it!

Mrs Norton	So do you guys think we can use this spell on someone?

Vic	We should maybe give it a try.

Art	She texted me back.

Phill/Vic	What is it? What is it? What is it?

Art	None of your business. I’m gonna meet with her. And discuss everything. I see you, guys, at Phill’s place.

Phill	I don’t know what I want to do more—follow Art and Kira on a date or use you to try out the new spell.

Vic	Use me?

Phill	Ha. Didn’t you say we should give it a try?

Kira	Well, finally! Where have you guys been?

Art	Er… Sorry, what?

Kira	Art? What are you doing here?

Art	Err… I came to see you.

Kira	Yeah, but how did you… What are you staring at?

Art	Your hair looks different.

Kira	Yeah… This prep school is obsessed with a straightlaced appearance.

Art	So why did you decide to go there?

Kira	It’s not like anyone asked my opinion. Mom was just like, “Well, Kira, I arranged everything at the prep school. You are now studying there. Or you won’t get your high-school diploma.”

Art	That sucks.

Kira	Yeah.

Art	Why didn’t you say anything about getting a D?

Kira	I don’t know. I thought I could handle it. / You were handling it somehow. Even Phill managed to get a C. Despite the fact that we were playing the game several hours a day! But I couldn’t make it, I failed. I’m stupid.

Art	I don’t think you are stupid at all.

Kira.	Thank you, Art. I’m sorry for not replying to all the messages you sent me.

Art	You know… The thing is… Mmm… Anyway, I like you too. I’ve been meaning to tell you, but… you texted me that first.

Kira	I texted you that first?

Art	Yeah.  “Arthur, I really like you. I’m in Cabin Café. Let’s go to the movies.” I got the tickets.

Kira	Wait a second. I didn’t text you. / Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no!

Karen/Marina	Surprise!

Karen	We’ve got a confession!

Marina	Smile into the camera!

Karen	You’ve been played, boy!

Kira	Hey! This is not funny! Stop it now!

Karen	Why do you even care? Didn’t you say yourself that you didn’t like him?

Marina	If we knew you liked him, we would never prank him.

Art	So this is just a prank?

Kira	It is, but… Ugh!

Art	Okay, I’m going.

Kira	Hold on, Art! 

Art	Everything’s fine.

Kira	Keep it here!

Marina	Don’t touch that!

Karen	Kira, either you’re with us…

Kira	You know what! I’m not afraid of you. If I find so much as a drop of glue in my purse, or even just think that I found it, or anything else of that sort, you both are gonna regret it! And from now on, don’t even come close to Mary. Am I clear?

Marina	Ha! I gotcha! You should have seen your face! All right, never mind.

Art	Where did you get invisibility?

Kira 	I stole the cloak from Harry Potter.

Creep	Creep?

Kira	Hey, Art… you think… the movie has already started?

Art	We’ll make it. Trailers for the first half an hour anyway.

Kira	Actually, I love watching trailers.

Art	I love them too.

Narrator	In the world where there’s no justice left, where evil stopped hiding in back alleys,  there is one hero prepared to change everything.

Male Lead	I’m prepared to change everything!

Female Lead	Don’t even think that you can do it on your own.

Male Lead	I can do it because I am the lone wolf.

Narrator	The Wolf and The Fox. World premiere!

Art	Wow! Are they for real?

Kira	I hate it when they don’t bother creating new comic superheroes and just churn out these sloppy rip-offs.

Art	Yeah, stupid. But we’ll have to watch.

Kira	We’ll have to watch

Kir	Art, back in the café… Whe I told those two girls that… that I don’t really like you…

Art 	Yeah, I got your point.

Kira	I didn’t really say the truth.

Viewers	Young man! Can you turn off the sound? Guys, are you kidding? Seriously? You couldn’t turn off your phone?

Art	Sorry! 

Art	Phill! What do you want?  You couldn’t call some other time?!

Phill	No, man! We have a problem with Vic!

Art	A problem with Vic?

Vic	Creep! / Creep, creep, creep

Mrs Norton	Vic, don’t do that! That’s dangerous!

Vic	Creep, creep

Art	Oh, let me guess this one. Doesn’t want to go down?

Mrs Norton	No. He doesn’t want to turn back into himself.

Vic 	Creep!

Phill	Where have you been?

Art	Doesn’t matter. Look who I brought with me! Huh?

Phill	Wow! You convinced Kira to give up Creep? Masterful talking!

Kira	Give up Creep?

Phill	You didn’t… tell her we need Creep?

Mourgarth	Well, the cube is at Chupacabrs`s. The end is near.

Mourgarth	I’m curious, Salamandra, do you think my position has a name? When a punching bag suddenly learned how to fight back?

Mourgarth	I really hope you can hear me. You shouldn’t have made this cube. Did it never even occur to you that I would want to use the cube myself? (chuckle) How arrogant and cocky you must have been!

Mourgarth	But I’m not complaining. After all, the children shouldn’t hold grudges against their own parents. I’ve been created by you to make the video game more interesting. And I can promise you. No one. In there. Will get bored.

Vic	Creep.

Phill	
Hold still, Creepman! I’m gonna turn you back to normal. Hey, come over here. Careful, okay. Okay. Grab him now! Quickly! He’s escaping! Come on! Faster! Faster! He’s gone! Wait a moment, please!

Art	Kira, hold on!

Kira	Thank you for a great date, Art! I have to go.

Art	I didn’t bring you back because of Creep.

Kira	Of course, not, it was just a coincidence.

Art	That’s the truth! You don’t believe me?

Kira	I do. But promise me you won’t give up Creep.

Art	I promise.

Kira	Vic! Quiet! Sit down!

Mrs Norton	Are you okay? Should we get a doctor?

Vic	Phiiill! Get over here!

Art	He is okay. No doctor needed.

Kira	Where is Chupacabra hiding the cube?

Art	We need to track him down.

Vic	Buckwit, where did he get it from?

Buckwit	Chupacabra collects objects that have been lost all over the game. Like misplaced coins. Or potion vials. Or misaimed arrows.

Vic	But it’s the arrow of the forest people. The marionettes have kidnapped them and hid them.

Buckwit	Oh, Chupacabra knows how to find what’s hidden.

Mrs Norton	Vic, it’s my turn to take the watch.

Vic	Nothing once again. I have no clue how he opens up his box.

Art	Sooner or later we’ll figure it out.

Art’s Dad	Oh! Hello, guys! Whatcha doing? Playing?

Art	Yeah…

Art’s Dad	You should go outside for a walk! The weather’s awesome!

Art	Yeah, yeah, dad. It won’t take long

Art	All right, I’m gonna go get Mrs Norton.

Art’s Dad	Artichoke! Have you been sitting here all night? Kiddo, this is wrong. Yes, I was also constantly staring at the screen when I was young. But that’s me. I was saving Arulco. And what do you have here? Dangerous Dave?

Art	Dad, no, it’s a different game.

Art’s Dad	It doesn’t matter! Playing games day and night is just not okay. Give it to me! I’m talking just like an adult. Ahem.

Art	We’re gonna play as much as we want to.

Art’s Dad	Not on my watch! I bear responsibility for you and for your well-being. And so get up, pack your things and let’s go to nature. Right now!

All	No! Wait a second! Stop! Don`t

Art’s Dad	Calm down! I put the game on pause.

Vic	 I hope Mrs Norton doesn’t mind that.

Mrs Norton	B-b-buckwit, save the game and exit. If you don’t mind. Be so kind!

Art’s Dad	Welcome to our house! Here’s the deal. You are not getting the laptop back until I see color in your faces.

Phill	New location unlocked. The edge of the map.

Art	Beyond the edge.

Kira	I’m worried about Mrs Norton.

Art	Relax! We’ve seen monsters much scarier than him. We can take care of my dad. The laptop’s in the car. Phill, distract dad. Vic, the car key is in the right pocket of his coat. Pull it out with your glove and throw it to me. I’m gonna open the car and get Mrs Norton out. Ready?

Phill	So, err, how do you like new Metal Gear? Sucks without Kojima, right?

Art’s Dad	I wouldn’t say so. I saw Art playing it. I think the game is really awesome! Yeah, amazing graphics. Prague is almost real.

Phill	Err… Prague was in the fourth MGS.

Art’s Dad	Yeah?

Phill	Yeah, it was released, like, ten years ago.

Art’s Dad	Is that right? Hahaha! That’s something we can check right now. Okay. Where’s my phone? Eh?

Kira	Erm… Death match?

Art	Hey, careful. do not let Chupacabra see you. Mrs Norton, are you here?

Mrs Norton	Arthur! I’m sorry.

Art	Did you find out where he’s hiding the cube?

Mrs Norton	No. But I’ve noticed another interesting thing.  The lights! There. You see them?

Art	That’s Mourgarth!

Chupacabra	Ah! So? Did you bring Creep?

Art	We have no time for this! Mourgarth is coming! Give me the cube or he is gonna take it from you!

Chupacabra	Haha! So what? I’ll find a way to make a deal with Mourgarth.

Mrs Norton	Art! They are here!

Art	Creep, as soon as I get the cube, fly away. (noises) And there’s no need to tell Kira about this, all right?

Art	He’s yours.

Art	Give me the cube!

Mourgarth	Ha. I think I’m right on time.

Mrs Norton	Art! Catch it!

Mrs Norton	Give me your hand.

Mourgarth	I can feel you hiding… somewhere very close. But I will let you go. Because I know that you will return. And when you do, watch your back! My revenge will be horrible!

Art’s Dad	Two on one? That’s not fair! 

Kira	Hey, guys!

Art	There’s no cube anymore.

Kira	Where’s Creep? What happened?

Art	Chupacabra took him and left.

Kira	But you promised me not to give up Creep!

Art	Kira, I’m sorry. But I didn’t have any other choice.

Kira	Then we are going back in the game to get him!

Art	No! That’s dangerous! Kira, look, we shouldn’t ever return into the game! Mourgarth is locked inside for good. We are the winners.

Phill	Winner winner chicken dinner?

Art	Something like that. Kira! Hold on!

Kira	Do not touch me!

Art	Argh! I hate this stupid game!

Art’s Dad	Head shot! Hahaha! How about that, kiddo? Haha! And this is for you! For you! And for… err… Hello! And this if for you.

Mrs Norton	Hello back.

Art	Dad, enough!

Art’s Dad	Haha! I don’t think so! This is the best weekend ever! We’re in the country, with your friends, playing Quake in the snow.

Art	What Quake, dad? Everyone stopped playing it a long time ago! Stop acting like you know what you are talking about! You’re an adult, not my friend.  

Art’s Dad	What’s that all about? Arthur! Where are you going? What’s gotten into him?

Phill	Please, forgive him. He has just saved… the world.

Art’s Dad	Happens to everyone.. at this troubled age.

Mourgarth	I agree. Plan B is a great idea. What would you say to that? Oh, come on. Don’t make me summon you in a formal manner, Buckwit!

Buckwit	What do you want?

Mourgarth	I’m offering you… a deal.

Buckwit	Err… Well, we have a little bit of time while the next level of the game is loading. 

Buckwit	As you can see, the players have already become attached to the game. At some point, Phill managed to get to the maximum level, which unlocked his personal kingdom. But nothing comes without a price. Phill can cast all sorts of potent and powerful spells but only as long as his kingdom remains intact. Which he is not sure about anymore. Vic’s story is different. There’s a race of healers in the game. Usually, they are not supposed to talk to players. But Vic managed to melt their Princess’ heart. Which lead to Mourgarth’s troops kidnapping her and all her people.

Kira	You have news? 

Phill	I got you a spell. Summoning a monster. I can summon Creep. Only… I’m not sure that it would be your Creep responding. What if there are a lot of them?

Kira	I’m coming with you.

Phill	To the game? But there’s a bunch of fans waiting for you there. 

Kira	We will have at least fifteen seconds. That’s enough.

Phill	A mission in fifteen seconds. Will it put us on the record list?

Kira	Err… You know, I used to think you are extremely unreliable. But now I understand that I was wrong. You’re reliable. Thank you for agreeing to help me with this.

Phill	No problem.

Kira	Everything’s okay?

Phill	Yeah.

Phill	Hello?

Vic	Phill, where’s the laptop?

Phill	Err… I believe Mrs Norton has it now.

Vic	I just asked her about it. She doesn’t have it.

Phill	Right. Why do you need it anyway?

Vic	Phill, where are you?

Phill	Look, man, I have to go.

Phill	Get this! Vic wants the laptop.

Kira	Urgh! And that’s when we all have agreed—no more entering the game.

Vic	Hey! What are you doing? Open the door!

Phill	It’s not working.

Kira	That way! Hurry!

Phill	Enemy, three o’clock. I mean, nine o’clock. I mean, nine fifteen!

Kira	Just stop it! You don’t know how to use clock for directions!

Phill	Like anyone else knows how to do that!

Kira	Where’s your magic?

Phill	Urgh! I ran out of it!

Kira	So what do we do now?

Phill	Kira, I think we should return to my kingdom. I need to recharge my tablet right now!

Kira	Why the rush? We didn’t make it to the record list anyhow.

Vic	Buckwit, listen, I want to save Val. How can I check where Chupacabra found her arrows? Is it like…

Computer	The history of finds.

Vic	Hello! Err… Where were the arrows of the forest people found?

Computer	The mothership of the marionettes. The route is planned. Make sure your seatbelt is fastened.

Vic	Ah! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! There are no seatbelts.

Computer	Wonderful. Enjoy your flight.

Vic	Whoah!

Phill	Done! While you’re in stealth mode, the hunt is off! I’d like to welcome you to Kingdom 4K-Phildor!

Kira	Did you come up with the name?

Phill	Of course!

Kira	Mmm… I recognize your style.

Computer	Missile straight ahead. Please, turn left.

Computer	Several missiles straight ahead. Please, turn around.

Computer	Critical damage sustained. Activating the catapult.

Vic	Wait, wait, wait, wait

Computer	Make sure your seatbelt is fastened.

Computer	You have arrived at your  destination.

Kira	You said it’s a party here day and night. But I don’t see anyone.

Phill	Well, it’s only 2 pm. Normal people are still sleeping. Oh! There you go! Ahem-ahem. Comfortable throne? No-no, it’s okay, no need to get up. It is only me, your king. / Hey! Wake up! Your Majesty needs resources! 

Kira	So those were your workers?

Phill	No! My workers are super cool, kind and they adore me!
Bearded Miner There you are!

Phill	Hey! What’s going on? Get your hands off of Your King’s body!

Bearded Miner	You are no king!

Girl Miner	A real king always takes care of his loyal subjects.

Big Miner	You lied to us!

Bearded Miner	You said that you defeated the fuel monster.  

Girl Miner	But he’s alive! You don’t have a kingdom anymore!

Big Miner	Such a bad king. Bad king. Bad king. Bad king.

Kira	Great job! Just amazing! Who else is the victim of your wrong doings?

Phill	You know, when you are invisible, it’s like you are my conscience. Ow! Conscience cannot start fighting!

Kira	Words are not having an effect on you!

Phill	Kira! Ow! Stop it already! Enough!

Kira	I explicitly asked you if everything’s okay. Why did you lie?

Phill	I wanted to help! You told me that I’m… reliable.

Kira	We cannot exit the game, we cannot fly out from here, we have nothing to fight monsters with… I’m not even able to punch you properly because I cannot see my own arms! I’m stuck in the game with an army of hunters behind the scenes. Thanks a lot for your help!

Phill	Did you just say, an army of hunters?

Phill	Okay. We know that monsters in this game aggro each other. One army is trying to hunt you down. And here I’ve got another one. So let’s just sic our armies on each other. We’ll be better off no matter what. I’m gonna be rooting for yours.

Kira	How do you imagine pulling that off?

Phill	Ehm… Well… You’ll turn off stealth mode and make a couple of laps around town. Preferably, loudly screaming.

Kira	You cannot see it, but I’m absolutely stoked!

Phill	Kira, this is gonna work. Please, trust me! I won’t let you down. I cannot summon Creep without mana.

Kira	Apparently, it’s either a bad plan, or no plan at all. The choice is obvious.

Vic	Val! Are you here?

Vic	Let me go!

Advisor	Quiet, quiet! Stop screaming! Biting is not fair!

Vic	It’s you?

Advisor	Partly.

Vic	But I thought you died!

Advisor	And I did. But Princess Val found me and saved my life.

Vic	She’s here? Where’s she? I’m gonna save her!

Advisor	I’m afraid that’s… a little impossible. I managed to hide here myself, but she was caught and turned into that.

Vic	I’m gonna get her out of there!

Advisor	Stop, stop, stop! I said, wait! Setting Val free is only half of the problem.

Vic	Yes. The other half is escaping from here.

Advisor	There’s also a third half. She won’t remember you. Master Vic, the more time a healer spends in the body of a marionette, the less they remember.

Vic	So… So she…

Advisor	Yes. Too much time. Let’s go, Master Vic. There’s an escape capsule here. Granted, it’s broken, but with your ability to fix things…

Vic	I want to save the forest people.

Advisor	Oh, come now, Master Vic! You don’t want to do that! That’s way too dangerous! We’ll have to distract all marionettes, neutralize the captain, seize the mothership and… I shouldn’t have said all that, huh?

Vic	Listen to me. I promised Val that I will set your people free. And that’s I’m gonna do!

Advisor	Daring, stupid, utterly reckless. I’m in.

Vic	Here’s the plan. I’m gonna take care of Val, while you’ll be distracting the others.

Advisor	Emm, I’m not so excited about this part of your plan.

Advisor	Ahem. May I have your attention? (Now, that’s a difficult audience.

Kira	Well, hello!

Phill	All right, everyone, good morning! Time to go to school! But you can skip the first class.

Vic	Val? It is me. If you’re in there, give me a sign.

Vic	How about a different sign?

Phill	Did it work?

Kira	You bet!

Phill	Virtus versus Liquid, round one.

Phill	That’s not fair!

Advisor	Wait a moment! Thank you! That’s enough for me. That’s so rude! Hey! 

Vic	Val? Hey… Do you remember me?

Vic	Ehh, I guess this means that you don’t. Or are you just angry at me? Val! It is me! Don’t you remember how we met? Remember giving me this medallion? Remember Art, and Kira, and Phill? You brought all of us to the secret village. I gave you a valentine! Come on! No!

Vic	My ribs… Ah, it’s fine. They will heal later.

Big Miner	Is the monster… gone?

Phill	Now definitely gone.

Phill	Oh, no-no-no. Don’t even try to talk me in. I have wronged all of you. I have… let you down. And I don’t deserve the honor to be called Your Royal Majesty.

Kira	We need to get fuel.

Phill	Okay, give it here!

Kira	Creep? Creep! Creep!

Chupacabra	Here, Creep!

Kira	Let him go, now! You hear me?

Chupacabra	Forget! Creep’s mine! You know how long I’ve been leveling him up?

Kira	I get it: “speech” failed. Phil!

Chupacabra	No! Don’t do that!

Kira	Creep, creep! Stop it. Come on now.

Phill	Wow. Looks like You’re gonna need a bigger purse from now on.

Advisor	Whose arm is this? Raise your hand if this is your arm!

Advisor	Your Majesty! Oh, I’m sorry. Simply Val.

Vic	How can we heal their memory?

Advisor	Mmm, let’s start by getting them back home.

Vic	Emm, How’s it going? Err… Well, I… All this time, I was imagining that we might end up alone somewhere. And… that I will have to talk to you. But I don’t know how. I was so afraid of that! I wanted you to think that I was smart and strong and cool. I… I even ended up asking Kira what to talk to you about and how to behave. And she was like, “You just have to relax and be yourself.” And I was like, “How’s that? What’s it’s like, being yourself? How do I know?”  So… yeah. But right now… we are here and… it’s so beautiful. I… I’m with you. I understand that… I don’t need to seem cool. It’s cool when we can just sit like this.

Kira	Brother?

Vic	Kira? Phill? Buckwit?

Buckwit	Heroes, I have bad news for you. The cube hasn’t been destroyed. Mourgarth still has a chance of escaping from the game. When you were solving the cube, you were supposed to set up a new password. I’m gonna leave the cube in the ruins on the edge of the woods. You need to take it and enter your password. And hurry up. Remember, every second counts.

Phill	Err… We didn’t set up a password.

Buckwit	Heroes, I have bad news for you.

Vic	It’s a recording.

Kira	Phill, did you solve the cube?

Phill	Me? I hate puzzles of any sort! It was Vic’s job.

Vic	No. It was Mr Turner’s.

Phill	That’s right!

Kira	Err.. Does anyone have his phone number?

Art	Yeah?

Vic	Hi! Errr… Is your dad close by?

Art	Why do you care?

Vic	Well… Just give him the phone!

Art	He went hiking. Without his cell phone. / I don’t know when he’ll be back.

Vic	Hiking? So he left you home alone?

Art	Yeah, he always does that when he’s depressed.

Vic	Oh… is it because of that fight at the country house?

Art	Yes, because of that.  What’s going on?

Vic	Art said he’s coming over.

Phill	What for? While Mr Turner is hiking, we won’t know the password.

Vic	And we don’t know when he’s coming back.

Phill	I really hate timed missions!

Kira	Phill, remember Mark shooting a video when he turned into the Slender Man?

Phill	I deleted it!

Kira	Were you filming that day?

Phill	Earlier. Earlier.

Vic	Phill, do you ever turn off your camera?

Phill	Of course, not! This is all for history! Look, look. Check it out!

Kira	Thank you. I really didn’t want to see that.

Phill	What?  It’s funny!

Kira	It is. But only when it’s done by Leonardo di Caprio. Not by Phill Andersson.

Vic	Here it is!

Kira	Did you delete everything?

Phill	Er… Yeah.  Look at you adjusting Mark’s little hat!

Kira	Do you want me to adjust your hat? 

Vic	Quiet!

Buckwit	Set up a new password.

Art`s Dad	Artichoke!

Vic	The most powerful device in the world can be accessed by the word “Artichoke?”

Phill	Imagine Mourgarth’s face if he finds out about this!

Art	Hey, guys! Can I get in on the laughing?

Kira	Strange place for a meeting!

Phill	Yeah. Very Uncharted.

Vic	Hey! Check it out! Someone’s there!

Art	Mrs Norton? Did you give them the laptop? Er… Are you here?

Kira	Mrs Norton, it’s you?  What are you doing here?

Mrs Norton	Oh! It’s you guys! I was looking for the laptop. I thought I lost it somewhere. I came to the dressing room and saw a message from Buckwit. And the laptop. I entered the game, err… and found this. Do you know how to solve it?

Phill	Go on! We know that it’s possible! Mr Turner did it, and so can you!

Vic	Phill, this is not helpful whatsoever!

Art	No!

Buckwit	Enter the password.

Vic	Errr… Artichoke.

Phill	Wait a sec. So if we destroy the cube right now, it’ll be officially a happy end?

Mrs Norton	Err… Buckwit said that the cube cannot be destroyed.

Vic	Right! I mean Art couldn’t do it!

Kira	All right, it cannot be destroyed. / What do we do next then?

Mrs Norton	Maybe I could have a look?

Art	Stop! Do not give her the cube! It’s all a lie! She’s not a real teacher!

Kira	What?

Art	There was a fake cube hidden in the teacher’s lounge! She must have swapped the cubes when we were fighting Mourgarth!

Mrs Norton	Arthur, I’m sorry, I don’t understand what you’re saying! What cube?

Art	There was also the bracelet of that lizard!

Mrs Norton	The lizard must have planted it there!

Art	And your cell phone.

Mrs Norton	Oh, I was missing it! I would never think of searching for it in the illusionary television.

Kira	Wait a minute! Art didn’t say where he found your cell phone. What’s going on, Mrs Norton?

Salamandra	Mrs Norton is no longer with us. From now on  you can call me Salamandra.

Art	Get the cube!

Salamandra	Couldn’t come earlier?

Mourgarth	Well, I wanted to see you in action.

Salamandra	Leave them alone!

Mourgarth	But of course. I remember our deal. I’m only wondering.  What for?

Salamandra	They make things interesting.

Mourgarth	I understand. / It’s rather difficult to find worthy opponents. / But back to business.

Salamandra	That’s it?

Mourgarth	You really thought I was controlling all the marionettes? No.  One squad is more than enough.  The rest are acting on their own.  Take it. The Envell world is yours.  And now, be so kind,  give me what’s mine.   

Mourgarth	Enjoy the game.

Art	Everyone okay?

Kira	Yeah!

Vic	Mrs Norton has betrayed us!

Phill	So did Buckwit! Guides in videogames always lie!

Buckwit	Nothing of the sort! I don’t have a right to lie!

Art	Ah, you!

Buckwit	Shut up! / Not a word! / Hm. / That’s right.

Art	You’ve lured us into the game to help Mourgarth break free!

Buckwit	He got his hands on the cube. And forced me to make an ultimate choice. Either he guesses the password himself and deletes me, or I help him with his goal and stay alive. Err … Forgive me, please. The choice wasn’t… a nice one.

Vic	How come you didn’t know that Mrs Norton was actually that lizard?

Buckwit	Mmm… I don’t know. It’s like… it’s like Mourgarth has done something to me.

Art	We’re gonna stop him in our world! Pull yourself together! Save the game and exit! / Buckwit!

Mourgarth	Well.  Let’s play a little.

Art	I knew I’d find you here.

Kira	Easy, easy. I won’t let him use you as a bargaining chip again!

Art	Kira, this is not the time. You know well how it was. I didn’t mean for anything bad to happen to you or Creep. I thought I was saving us. / Remember that time we danced here?

Kira	Get back, Creep! That’s Art! Stop it!

Art	Maybe, he doesn’t remember me?

Kira	Go away!

Phill	Stop-stop-stop-stop-stop! What on earth is this? Where is your weapon?

Girl Miner	Oh, right. I forgot.

Phill	Use your shield! Like this. Marionettes always strike from the right. Except for the cases when they strike from the left.

Art	Phill, are you gonna help me?

Phill	I can’t. My troops just are not trained enough yet.

Art	We don’t need your troops. Your magic is enough.

Phill	I can’t abandon them. Salamandra is now the ruler of Envell. All peoples of the game have to follow her orders. Sooner or later, her troops are gonna come here… and that will be… a big party.

Big Miner	Oh, I love having parties!

Phill	Art, I’m sorry, but I can’t help you. The kingdom cannot defend itself.

Advisor	Oh, thank you for your help.

Elf Girl	
Wait a minute! What should I do with this?

Advisor	Only one very simple thing. Take it to Master Vic. (reaction) And another only one thing. Whatever the case, don’t drop it!

Art	Here you go. I couldn’t find more. Are you ready now?

Vic	We need one more.

Art	Stop making excuses, Vic! Are you gonna help me?

Vic	Art, do you really want to go to Salamandra’s palace? Just like that? Without an army, without training, without saves?

Art	Yes! I’m not going to wage a war. I just want to talk to her.

Vic	To talk to her? Art, this is not Fallout. You cannot load a shotgun with your charisma.

Art	Oh, that’s right! Let’s just stay in the game doing nothing!

Vic	I have plenty to do! I need to rebuild the settlement. I need to reinforce the defense. 

Art	You need to hang out with Val.

Vic	Look, what can we do? We’re locked in the game. Salamandra knows where we’re hiding. We have to prepare for her attack. And outside, Mourgarth will be dealt with without us. Oh! Give it here! 

Art	What on earth is that?

Vic	A beacon for discovering enemies. If an enemy’s close, we’ll hear an alarm. I guess I didn’t assemble it right.

Minister	M…err… Your Majesty. About  m… er… the coronation…

Salamandra	The coronation is still on. The ceremony will be held on the central square. Tell the guards they are dismissed. I have the protection of my marionettes. Oh, and I will need another crown.

Minister	As you wish.

Art	What, the crown’s too small?

Salamandra	You shouldn’t have come.

Art	Easy, easy, easy. I only want to talk to you.

Salamandra	We have nothing to talk about.

Art	Hey! Enough! Mrs Norton, stop it now! I know you don’t really want to kill me.

Salamandra	You think I’m joking?

Art	There! That’s exactly what I couldn’t understand. I kept wondering why you hadn’t attacked us earlier.

Salamandra	There were four of you. I cannot handle four enemies in open combat.

Art	What? Seriously? Invisibility and taking the form of other people! With those abilities, you can do just about anything! You could just turn into Kira and take the laptop.

Salamandra	There are restrictions! I cannot transform into anyone. And the invisibility is not endless.

Art	That’s not the point. You gained our trust. You’d been with us all this time. You had plenty of chances to stab us in the back.

Salamandra	Mourgarth was using you to find the cube.

Art	That’s what I thought at first. But something didn’t quite add up. You found the cube with me, swapped the real cube for a fake one, made everyone think that I destroyed the cube. Why go to all that trouble? It’d be easier to get rid of us and just keep searching for the cube. But then I remembered your conversation with Mourgarth. He asked you, “Why?” And you answered, “They make things interesting.” You had a deal with Mourgarth that he wouldn’t hurt us. Because you’re not one of those videogame villains.

Salamandra	Technically, I am a villain.

Art	Wait, really? I was right? You’re good? (reaction) I didn’t think this would work.

Salamandra	I’m good? Having problems with your moral compass? But you got one thing right. It’s true that I didn’t want to do you any harm. You were not even supposed to get involved in all of this. And besides, you’re just kids.  What now?

Art	Nothing, it’s just… I’m not used to talking to a giant lizard. Not that I have anything against lizards. I don’t.

Salamandra	I’m not a lizard. This is my real shape. Only my hair used to look different. I was always playing for the thief.

Art	You were playing before?

Salmandra	Quite a lot..

Art	I have so many questions.

Salamandra	I`m not your Buckwit

Art	Humor me! Just one question!

Salamandra	All right. Only one.

Art	What`s going on?

Salamandra	So you’re not letting this go? I don’t know a lot really. I was invited to test Heroes of Envell. I started to play and fell in love with this game at first sight. I played it non-stop for months at a time. But then the game developers created Mourgarth. Nobody knew how to beat him. I wanted to try and talk to him, to make him change his mind. But the developers were against it. We had a fight. At that time, I learned about the existence of the cube and the world editor. The developers wanted to delete my character. I wasn’t going to put up with that. I told Mourgarth about the cube. And we made a deal. I help Mourgarth to get out of the game, and in exchange, he gives the game to me. But to achieve my goal, I needed the cube. But what could I do in the real world, alone against all developers? Mourgarth gave me power. He made me one of the game’s bosses. After becoming Salamandra, I managed to lure the developers into a trap set up by Mourgarth. But not before they passed the cube to Buckwit. Then you found the cube. Then you lost it. Mourgarth wanted to concentrate all his efforts on finding it and I was supposed to stop you. But I knew that the cube could be password-protected. I offered him another option. I would help you find the cube and make sure that you don’t destroy it.   And then if the cube doesn’t have a password, it’s a win. And if there’s a password, I’ll learn it from you. In exchange, Mourgarth promised not to hurt you. And that’s it.

Art	And you really wanted to stay here?

Salamandra	Don’t you understand it? What’s so good about the real world? Stress, problems, responsibility… Loneliness. Here, you’re judged fairly for what you’ve achieved. You can develop, get to the maximum level and become a real king! In the real world, you might have talent and diligence, but absolutely no guarantee of success! You need to bend over backwards to get the slightest bit of attention. But here… we… are heroes. It’s easier. I don’t want to go back.

Art	I want to go back. It might be easier here. But… But that’s my home. Will you help me get out of here? 

Salamandra	I’m curious, what were you expecting? I don’t have the cube. The laptop’s closed or broken. There are no other ways out.

Art	How were you communicating with Mourgarth?

Salamandra	Who are you looking for?

Art	Mark! 

Art	Mark! Wait! I’m here!

Mark	Art! What’s going on?

Art	Mark, I really need your help.

Mark	Whoah! Awesome! But you know what? I don’t believe you. This is just another one of your pranks. And I’m not gonna buy it. Pff! Animatronics!

Art	There has to be another way out.

Salamadra	You should try asking someone else.

Principal	Okay…

Art	Mr Palmer!

Principal	Well, who did this?

Art	Mr Palmer! Can you help us! Can you at least pass the camera to Stark? / It’s urgent! / Can you even hear us?

Mourgarth	es. I hear you perfectly.

Salamandra	What do you want?

Mourgarth	I’m testing your loyalty.

Salamandra	We are even. I don’t owe you anything.

Mourgarth	But of course.

Art	That was… weird.

Salamandra	Yes… It was odd… Order! Tighten border security! Immediately!

Minister	Err… Your Majesty, but you have already given an order to dismiss all guards.

Art	You think Mourgarth is going to attack you?

Salamandra	He… already did.

Art	What’s going on?

Salamandra	What do you think? Mourgarth thinks that I’m helping you.

Art	But he gave the game to you!

Salamandra	That’s what I thought too.

Art	So what should we do now?

Salamandra	You figure it out. It’s every man for himself.

Art	Anyone! I need help! 

Mark	Hey, Turner! I don’t know if you’re there, but “thanks” for ratting me out to the principal.

Art	Please, help me!

Mark	What? I can’t hear you. Are you playing Destiny? 

Art	Mark! This is not a game!

Art	Kira?! What are you doing here?

Kira	I was keeping an eye on you, obviously. Hold on tight! We’re leaving!

Art	Wait! Let’s go back! We need to fix this thing!

Kira	What is it?

Art	Our only means of contacting the outside world. 

Kira	How does it work?

Art	Like Skype. I found Mark and asked him for help. (reaction) Only he didn’t listen to me.

Kira	And how did you ask him?

Art	I asked him nicely! Ow! (groan) We just should’ve been friendly with him instead of fighting all the time.

Kira	I’ve always been saying that!

Art	Oh, come on! He was accessorizing with band-aids?

Kira	That time, it was his fault!

Mark	Hey, guys! I can hear you.

Kira	Hey, Mark! Where are you now?

Mark	In school, obviously.

Kira	Listen! Can you please go down to the closet under the stairs on the first floor! There should be a laptop there. See, I need you to open it for me. It’s very important. Please? 

Mark	Err… All right.

Art	Why was he willing to listen to you, but not me?

Kira	I have a gift. Of convincing.

Art	Hey, Mark! Please, hurry up!

Vic	I knew he’d be here! 

Vic	Val! I can’t turn the ship around in time! 

Kira	Art! You have to save them!

Mark	Kira? I’m in the closet. But your laptop is smashed to pieces.

Kira	You think you can fix it?

Mark	Err… I‘m not sure.

Kira	Listen, that wasn’t a question. You can fix it!

Phill	Tram, pam, pam-pam-pa-param! Pam, pam, pram-pam-pam-pam. (sigh) To express your gratitude, you should press the like button. Er… Vic? What are you doing here?

Vic	I came here to save Art.

Phill	Wait a sec! / I came here to save Art before you!

Art	Hey, quiet! All of you…

Phill, Vic	Watch out!

Art	Relax! They are friends!

Phill	And this one is also a friend, right?

Vic	First, throw a meteorite at him, and then we’ll see.

Phill	I’ve spent all my resources on the storm!

Art	Stay back and recover! We’ll distract him.

Kira	Hi, everybody!

Vic	Hello! (reaction) Did you also come here to save Art?

Phill	Everyone’s saving him today.

Kira	I was saving Art way before it became mainstream.

Vic	V-val… It’s all… gonna… be…(groan)  okay… 

Vic	Val! What have you done?

Val	I’m sorry.

Kira	Brother, you okay?

Vic	Val… (breathing) Mourgarth’s gonna pay for this!

Mark	Guys? Are you there? Something bad’s happening. Looks like… aliens are invading the city.

Art	Did you fix the laptop?

Mark	Yeah! You should really thank my physics tutor!

Art	Thank you, Mark! Alright. Everyone ready? Mark, step away from the laptop. We’re coming / home.

Art	Mark, all of this is real. It’s very important that you believe us now.

Mark	A final boss from a videogame broke out into the real world and now wants to take over it. Err… Okay. I guess I believe you. 

Kira	I told you, he’ll understand.

Mark	I always knew something was off! And lately, things have gotten pretty weird around here. But now it all make sense. Well now, should we go and kick the final boss’s butt?

Art	Well, Mark, we’d like to welcome you to our t… Ah, great! Mark… Hey, Mark?

Kira	Phi-i-ill!

Phill	Don’t look at me, this time it wasn’t me!

Art	Mark, you can dance later. It’s time to fight Mourgarth!

Mark	That’s all right. I can wait.

School Principal	We don’t need to hurry.

Classmates	Let’s play a little.

Kira	Hold on! These are people! 

Phill	Three seconds! Hurry up!

Art	To the right!

Phill	I always thought Mark would end up on our team.

Art	We have to find Mourgarth.

Phill	How? “Excuse me, but have you by any chance seen a four-armed gentleman around here?”
	
Kira	There’s no one to ask.  No signal.

Art	Everyone has turned into marionettes.

Kira	Why haven’t we followed their fate?

Phill	Because we are  players.

Vic	They are carrying resources somewhere.

Art	We should follow them.

Kira	Foggy just like in Silent Hill.

Art	Dude, do you see anything? 

Vic	Yeah. Looks like everyone’s going to that point.

Phill	Saving his strength before one powerful attack. Sick. I’d do the same thing if I were him.

Kira	Better think about what you’d do if you were us!

Art	How about Kira becomes invisible and steals the cube? While we’ll be distracting Mourgarth.

Phill	Don’t you think it’s too simple?

Art	A simple plan is easy to carry out. 

Phill	And just as easy to blow. 

Mourgarth	I see you were quick to find me.

Art	Well, you’re a round chambers kinda guy.

Mourgarth	I like to adjust the reality to my very taste.

Vic	So… do you like our world?

Mourgarth	I’ll be honest. I am loving it. Grey skies, (chuckle) wonderful architecture, and people who have never even heard about videogames is the most peculiar thing.

Phill	Welcome to Saint Petersburg.

Art	So… have you… already conquered the Earth? 

Mourgarth	Oh, no. I have just started.

Art	Daddy?

Art’s Dad	Hello, kiddo! / How are things at school? / What, / are you going to fight your own father?

Vic	Art! It’s possible to wake them up! I’ve mentioned that before. You need to remind him about something he really likes!

Art	Dad! Err… Remember your favorite game about the mercenaries? Or how about that pirate quest? You really liked it! What’s it called, huh? Phill!

Phill	What? You think I know all games?

Art	I have absolutely no idea what my father likes!

Mourgarth	Oh, no-no-no! I am not done playing yet!

Art	No! 

Art	Leave my father alone!

Mourgarth	In that case, lay down your weapons!

Phill	I have an offer! Err… Listen, so let’s say you beat us. And then what? We are the only players.  How about you let us go? We are gonna work on our skills, come back, have another big fight. And we can sort of have like an eternal rivalry, huh. Like Joker and Batman. Right?

Mourgarth	Ah, that’s so tempting. / But you know what? / I’ll find other things to do after my victory.

Art	Only / you let your guard down too fast. / I liked the way you put that other time, / “In a good game, any battle can be won with words.”

Mourgarth	Oh! Finally!  I was waiting for you to show your face. If you don’t mind… Is that it?  Or have you prepared a plan B? No? (sigh) That’s quite a shame. You won’t get to see everything I’ve prepared for you. And so, all five of you are here. It’s time to put an end to this.


Kira	Five of us?

Mourgarth	But of course! Did you really think I wouldn’t notice you, Salamandra? Oh, I assume you wanted to appear at the last moment and save our heroes. Sorry. I ruined the moment.

Salamandra	Let them go!

Mourgarth 	I see you have your instrument. / Go on, / play something for us.

Salamandra	Well, I think I can only do Jimi Hendrix.

Mourgarth	Playing solos with your teeth?

Salamandra	Setting the guitar on fire!

Mourgarth 	Salamandra.  I gave you your own perfect world. The World of Envell.  You were free to do anything you wanted there. But you returned here. Tell me, why?

Salamandra	That’s because… They are my friends.

Mourgarth	Did you actually hope to save them?  But you knew that I can easily get rid of you.

Salamandra	Yes.  That was exactly… what I was counting on.

Mourgarth	Bravo 

Kira	The signal’s back.

Art	Hey, dad! You okay?

Art’s Dad	Where am I? Oh! Artichoke!

Art	Dad, I hope you can forgive me. The things I said were really unfair. What I’m trying to say is I didn’t mean it. And the truth is…

Art’s Dad	Ah, it’s all right, kiddo! I’m not angry! As long as you are safe and sound, nothing else really matters. Or does it?

Phill	I’ve got thirty five missed calls from my parents. I’m so dead.

Vic	Hundred forty three. Who did you say… is dead?

Kira	Fifteen hundred… and… seven. And that’s just from my mom.

Phill	Okay. You’re the winner.

Vic/Phill/Kira	Yeah. Hi mom/dad! Yeah, everything’s okay. I was… I was playing videogames with friends.

Vic	Everything okay?

Kira	Yeah. I couldn’t get out earlier.

Art	Where’s Mourgarth?

Vic	I have no clue where he is except that he’s really far away.

Art	Phill, did you figure it out? 

Phill	Na-ah! I can’t edit anything while he’s inside the game.

Kira	If we leave him in there like that, he’ll seize the whole Envell again.

Phill	Hang on. Mourgarth is now / the fifth player. And I can give him a timed quest to complete. And if he fails to complete it, he’ll be kicked back to the checkpoint.

Art	I doubt he’ll fail anything, considering he has literally our whole arsenal.

Phill	I’m gonna give him… just one… second to complete it.

Art	Ooof! Touché!

Vic	So that means, he’s losing the game every second.

Kira	I’m starting to doubt who’s actually the biggest villain here.

Phill	Really, you don’t have to thank me.  You can… just start calling me a genius.  That’s good enough.

Kira	Somehow, I was hoping that in the end we would save her.

Vic	Same here.

Art	Buckwit, where did all the players go?

Buckwit	They… They are not playing anymore. That’s how it is. I’m very sorry.

Journalist	More than a month has passed since the incident, yet the scientists are still at a loss as to what caused the mass fainting which got its own hashtag in the social networks, Grand Nap. To recap, as a result of the incident, one whole day was erased from the memory of all city residents. Luckily, there were no victims. Nevertheless, some people still complain about significant memory loss. City Resident I don’t know who and where I am.  But I do like it here.

Vic	I remember you swearing, “After Envell, I’m never playing videogames again.”

Phill	Look, man,  with everything we’ve been through! I realized I should make use of that. And that’s why… I signed up for gamedev classes. I’m gonna be building my own games.

Vic	Right. Only the game you’re playing now is not yours.

Phill	Well, this is called, “Reference collection.”

Mark	Andersson, playing after classes too? So are you ready for the exams? Oh, no, don’t tell me. You’re too lazy to answer anyway. Oh! Good afternoon, Mister Palmer. Err… Nice weather today, don’t you think?

Phill	Why is it that out of all days he forgot the only one when he was a normal guy?

Vic	To think that we almost became friends.

Art	Yes. Yes, dad.  No. No, you need to grab the crystal, insert it into the slot next to the bridge,  and then press on it. Yeah, don’t sweat it. Alright, bye. Dad is playing God Of War.

Kira	Cool. The only thing my dad likes playing is Solitaire.

Art	I still… cannot believe it.

Kira	Me… neither.

Art	Maybe… we should tell the guys?

Kira	You’re ready to be ridiculed?

Art	We survived two battles with Mourgarth. What’s a couple of jokes next to that?

Phill	No, no, no, no, no! Don’t mind us! The secret’s long been out. If you want, I can marry you. It will be official, too, ‘cause I’m a king. Kira, do you agree to take as your lawfully wedded…

Art/Kira	Back off! Phill, what are you doing?

Kira	Do you think Salamandra… I mean Mrs Norton… really sacrificed herself? Could it… have been a set-up like she did before?

Vic	If all of that was just a set-up, the laptop wouldn’t consider Mourgarth a new player.

Art	But why him?  And not any of the other people who were there? That place was pretty crowded.
Phill	Those were all marionettes. Nothing but bots.

Art	How can people be bots in the real world?

Kira	And how were our weapons working? Or bottomless backpacks?

Phill	I guess we should make a list of questions.

Vic	Actually, I’ve already made one.

Vic	Who created the game? Why isn’t there a single mention of it on the Internet? What’s the physical location of the game?  How can Mourgarth be a player?  What did he want? Was it really just to conquer the world? And the list keeps going for six pages.

Phill	There’s only one way we can find out the truth.

Vic/Kira/Art	Phill, no!

Phill	Oh, come on, guys! I just wanna take a peek at my kingdom.

Kira	
Art, do you still have the cube?

Art	Yeah, I hid it at home. And Vic has the password. But! Even if Phill manages to steal the cube… and learn the password, there will still be the biggest obstacle left.  The cube requires solving.

Kira	Yeah!  No way Phill can do that.

Phill	Look who’s talking! You yourself…

Kira	Creep should not be held in the game.

Phill	Let’s show the cube to the public! We’ll become celebrities!

Vic	Phill, Mourgarth broke into our world,/ and no one was able to beat him. We cannot entrust the cube to anyone.

Phill	All right, no entrusting. / We’ll be using it ourselves. We have superpowers. And we’ve already defeated one supervillain. You were the one who said we can be superheroes. Right?

Art	The way I see it… we already are.

Buckwit	Do you know what the hardest part of my job is? It’s to remain indifferent. I have no right to intervene. All I can do is give the players game tips. It is you who made me this way. So I didn’t have to bring you back to life. It’s none of my business. Especially since I know what you want to do with my world.

Buckwit	But I thought that I could… make you change your mind. That’s when I told the kids… that you don’t play… anymore. (chuckle) And they just assumed that you’re dead. Well, I see you now remember everything. And now… I think you and I… should have a chat.
