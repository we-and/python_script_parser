Surprise!%%23%%22
Oh my God, you're huge.%%23%%22
No traffic.%%23%%22
And I crushed the final.%%23%%22
%%23%%22
No such luck.%%23%%22
My mom was the math genius.%%23%%22
Look at you.%%23%%22
Wow. Bag packed.%%23%%22
House looks great.%%23%%22
You've been busy.%%23%%22
Where is Miranda?%%23%%22
Yes.%%23%%22
Thank you, thank you.%%23%%22
You sure you're okay?%%23%%22
Seriously, I am here to help.%%23%%22
Mm. Yum.%%23%%22
True.%%23%%22
That's definitely in the genes.%%23%%22
He has that because of you.%%23%%22
Really? You think he's funny?%%23%%22
No wonder he loves you.%%23%%22
Whatever you say.%%23%%22
Oh. I got this for Anthony. Isn't he cute?%%23%%22
And I got this%%23%%22
from my friend who's a psych major.%%23%%22
I think it might help. Dad said Miranda's%%23%%22
still not doing well.%%23%%22
Good.%%23%%22
They should be home soon, right?%%23%%22
Oh.%%23%%22
What is it? What's wrong?%%23%%22
No.%%23%%22
I'll go.%%23%%22
Yes, it makes the most sense.%%23%%22
You should stay here and wait for Miranda to come home.%%23%%22
I'll follow you.%%23%%22
I will.%%23%%22
We'll find her.%%23%%22
I haven't seen him in months.%%23%%22
I've been away at school.%%23%%22
He was so happy with Jenny and the baby.%%23%%22
Still no word on Miranda?%%23%%22
Morning?%%23%%22
That's too late.%%23%%22
I have to do something. I can't just sit here.%%23%%22
I can get volunteers through social media.%%23%%22
Wait, what?%%23%%22
Where's the sheriff? Why isn't he here?%%23%%22
Who's in charge?%%23%%22
But you're not.%%23%%22
My dad is dead, and my sister is missing.%%23%%22
What are you doing about it?%%23%%22
No, you don't.%%23%%22
Jesus.%%23%%22
You called the others, right?%%23%%22
I know, but I just can't sit here anymore%%23%%22
doing nothing.%%23%%22
The deputies aren't telling me anything%%23%%22
and I don't even think they know what they're doing.%%23%%22
I know it's dangerous, you don't have to do it.%%23%%22
Okay. Thank you.%%23%%22
I'll see you in an hour at the rest stop.%%23%%22
And keep it quiet.%%23%%22
Watch your step.%%23%%22
Can we hurry up, please?%%23%%22
 Yeah, I do. He's old.%%23%%22
We should branch out.%%23%%22
Guys! Come here.%%23%%22
That's Miranda's.%%23%%22
Positive.%%23%%22
Does that mean you found her?%%23%%22
Is there something we can do?%%23%%22
Can we go with you%%23%%22
and organize the volunteer search party there?%%23%%22
Please?%%23%%22
Understood.%%23%%22
We wanna help look for Miranda.%%23%%22
Miranda!%%23%%22
Thank God. Thank God.%%23%%22
Oh my God.%%23%%22
I can't get through. It keeps going straight to voicemail.%%23%%22
Hello?%%23%%22
I'll make you a sandwich.%%23%%22
Oh, my God.%%23%%22
Let's go.%%23%%22
The bag. The bag.%%23%%22
Breathe, Mom. Breathe.%%23%%22
