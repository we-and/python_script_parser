NON	I(blows saxophone) It's impossible.

CECIL	Don't ever use that word in my presence.

SYDNEY	Another girl came forward. If we go to the police together, maybe they'll get off their asses and arrest him.

CARLTON	Right about now, you might want to make travel plans.

EBONIE	I told you everything that Danny and his goons did to me. And you joined that band anyway?

EVA	It's not a bad thing to do something you love to do, despite how you feel.

TERRENCE	Why?

COACH HARDWICK	Right now, you need a lawyer.

DRE	Chantel won't want you getting down like that, bro. Mess up what you got here.

CARLTON	Ooh. Mmm. Ooh. (chuckles)

JASON	See, that's good...

DEREK	Yeah.

CARLTON	Ah--ah. (chuckles) Oh. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

JASON	That's style, right there.

DEREK	Mm, yeah, mm.

MAN	(chuckling)

WOMAN	(laughing)

CARLTON	(laughs)

ALL	(laughing)

EVA	(exhales) Shit.

NONI	Oh. Sir. You're back.

CECIL	I am. And you're here. Why?

NONI	Just--just to return this. We didn't know you were getting out so soon.

CECIL	I discharged myself. I can't be laying around a hospital bed with homecoming around the corner. Giving up?

NONI	Oh, no-no-no. No, never. I am just ready for bigger challenges, sir. I mastered this one.

CECIL	Good. The great mold themselves in the fire of their will.

NONI	Yes, we do, sir--they. Yes, they do. Sir. I do. I was there. At the hospital. Um, but you were pretty...

CECIL	Sedated.

NONI	Yeah.

CECIL	The great are also conscious of the gifted. I knew you were there.

NONI	That's good to know, sir. Thank you.

PROFESSOR RUDOLPH	Not only did you all pass the midterm, but two of you solved the extra credit problem. Mr. Hobbs, Ms. Platt, go ahead and stand, take a bow.

PROFESSOR RUDOLPH	All right. Uh--you all are dismissed.

BRONWYN	Hey, Cedric. Hi, I'm Bronwyn.

CEDRIC	Good job on the test.

BRONWYN	Oh, thanks. You too. Um, I was wondering. I tutor math at Andrew Young Elementary. You think you might be interested in something like that?

CEDRIC	Nah, that's not really my thing, no offense.

BRONWYN	(soft laugh) None taken. But look, you just look as far from a math geek as anybody can get, and the at-risk kids might respond to you, you know?

CEDRIC	(soft laugh) You saying I look at-risk?

BRONWYN	No, no. I--I'm not saying that, I'm just...

CEDRIC	Damn. Supposed to be a joke.

BRONWYN	Oh.

CEDRIC	Nah, but on the real, I don't know nothing about teaching.

BRONWYN	No, but look, you just got an A on a crazy hard exam. That's all you need to know. Look, I really got to get to class. Just think about it, okay?

TRINA	Hey.

MADISON	Hi.

SYDNEY	Hello, Trina.

TRINA	You ready, Sydney?

SYDNEY	I am.

TRINA	Good.

MADISON	Syd, you sure about this?

SYDNEY	No. I'm not. I'm scared as shit. Which is why I don't need any more doubt-talk.

MADISON	Look, it is not doubt-talk. It's worry. But I get it, you don't need any more of that, so. Let's go.

MAN	One, two, three, four, five...

TERRENCE	All right, y'all. (claps) Listen up! Listen up! (claps) Bring it in. Yo, kill the music. Y'all, this isn't just our homecoming. It's an opportunity to let everybody know that luck ain't got nothing to do with our wins.

MAN	Right.

TAVARUS	You're damn right about that.

MAN	Yeah.

TERRENCE	So get your minds right. Focus. On three, no distractions, y'all. Let's go.

MAN	Yeah.

MAN	Do it.

HENDERSON	No distractions, huh? Does that include you?

TERRENCE	It includes me, man. Now join the team.

VERNON	Come on, man. You in here or what?

HENDERSON	Get off his damn jock. We putting up W's, and we still getting dragged. Why?

JUNIOR	Guys, let's just focus on the homecoming game.

BOJOHN	I'm with Junior on this one. We need to focus. Keep our ducks in a row.

TERRENCE	(laughs) Listen that--your country ass. Ain't nobody got no ducks.

HENDERSON	Exactly what's wrong with you, man.

JUNIOR	Come on...

TERRENCE	It's about us sticking together. That's why, as team captain, I called this meeting. Remind us, we got this, y'all.

HENDERSON	If you a team captain, then act like it. 'Cause you ain't said nothing to us about what these chicks accuse you of.


TAVARUS	Yo, I'm with you on that one. We should've heard something straight from you a long time ago. You supposed to be our lead.

MAN	Yeah, man.

HENDERSON	That's what I thought, boy. You must be guilty.

TERRENCE	What'd you say?

HENDERSON	You heard me.

BOJOHN	Hey-hey-hey-hey!

JUNIOR	Chill.

ALL	(shouting)

BOJOHN	You good! You good!

ALL	(shouting)

COACH HARDWICK	Hey-hey-hey-hey! The hell's going on in here, huh?

HENDERSON	Ask Captain Secret Lover to improve performance.

VERNON	Oh, yo, man, come on, man.

BRONWYN	Look, don't get intimidated just because it's a word problem. Math is just, um, like translating a language. Some people, they might speak Spanish and then other people, they might speak English, but anybody can speak math. You guys understand?

CEDRIC	Hey, um, y'all listen up. It's like graffiti or a text-chat. You gotta know, uh, the signs and the symbols. Once you understand that, well then you can write it out. Manipulate it, make it say what you want it to say. Like if I wanted to say, um, it's Deontay, right?

DEONTAY	Yeah.

CEDRIC	If I want to say, "Deontay is dope forever," I say, "D equals sign--which means is-- and infinity symbol here, which means forever." Y'all get that?

KIDS	Yeah.

SCARED KID	Give it back!

LEMICHAEL	Shut up.

BRONWYN	Wait-wait-wait. What's going on? What's the deal?

SCARED KID	He took my money.

BRONWYN	Is that true, LeMichael?

LEMICHAEL	No.

CEDRIC	Come on, Shorty, just give it back to him and it's squashed.

LEMICHAEL	I told you, I ain't got his money.

CEDRIC	So why he think you do?

BRONWYN	Look, just empty your pockets, LeMichael. Please.

CEDRIC	You heard her. Come on, empty your pockets, Shorty.

LEMICHAEL	I ain't emptying shit.

CEDRIC	Ain't nobody playing with you...

LEMICHAEL	Hey, get off! Get your hands off...

CEDRIC	No, no...

LEMICHAEL	Get your hands off me!

CEDRIC	No...

BRONWYN	Ced, get off of him.

BRONWYN	You guys go sit down right now. Go, right now.

LEMICHAEL	Asshole.

CEDRIC	What?

BRONWYN	Sit down. What is wrong with you?

CEDRIC	What's wrong with me?

BRONWYN	You can't put your hands on a kid, Ced. That is against the law.

CEDRIC	It's against the law to steal, too. I told you I don't know nothing about this teaching stuff.

BRONWYN	But you know a little something about common sense, right?

CEDRIC	You need to ask yourself the same damn question, man.

WOMAN	Yeah, that's true.

ALYSSA	Junior hit the lottery. Tiesha's really pretty.

BOJOHN	They're just friends.

ALYSSA	Oh. You think she's pretty?

BOJOHN	I don't know.

ALYSSA	I think you do.

TAVARUS	You look beautiful tonight.

WOMAN	Thank you.

TAVARUS	Yeah.

EVA	Good afternoon, everyone.

ALL	Good afternoon.

EVA	And welcome to our annual homecoming banquet.

EVA	Congratulations on being bowl-eligible for the first time this decade.

JUNIOR/BOJOHN/HENDERSON	You know!

TERRENCE	Whoo-whoo-whoo!

EVA	We will now say grace. Coach Hardwick.

COACH HARDWICK	My pleasure. Let us bow our heads.

TERRENCE	Coach, may I say a few words?

COACH HARDWICK	Sure.

TERRENCE	(clears throat) GAMU changed my life. Football, this squad-- y'all are everything. With this team by my side, we're gonna continue to make you proud. Thank you.

TERRENCE	Thank you, Coach.

COACH HARDWICK	Thank you for those words, T, and a great season so far. All right. Let us bow our heads. Dear Lord...

SYDNEY	I did not consent!

SYDNEY	I didn't consent. I did not consent.

TRINA	I did not consent!

MICHELLE	I did not consent!

WOMEN	(chanting) I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent! I did not consent...

BRUCE	Dr. Fletcher, did you know about the demonstration beforehand?

EVA	I didn't.

JILL	Since the university doesn't have the same standard of proof as the criminal justice system, what would be Terrence Berry's fate if the university decides he's guilty?

ASHLEY	They have publicly tried and convicted Terrence Berry. Yet he has not been charged with anything. At best, this is rank bullying. At worst, it's ugly vigilante justice. He's too upset to appear at this press conference, so I will speak for him. We are deeply disappointed in the university president for her lack of support. When Cedric Hobbs was arrested, she insisted he receive his constitutional presumption of innocence. "When a student chooses Georgia A&M, we choose them right back." Those were Eva Fletcher's words. Well, Terrence Berry is waiting for you to choose him, Dr. Fletcher.

ASHLEY	Thank you.

SYDNEY	Thank you for waiting. The campus police decided we didn't need to be put through processing for protesting.

LYNN	Why disrupt your mother's first homecoming banquet?

SYDNEY	To get your attention. Myself and another woman spent this morning giving the Atlanta Police Department our statements regarding being sexually assaulted by Terrence Berry. I was drunk when he raped me. My inebriation was an opportunity for Terrence to be a gentlemen or a rapist. He chose to be a rapist. I know I exercised poor judgment by drinking too much. I'm not proud of that.

BRUCE	Are you saying that you were too drunk to know what was going on?

SYDNEY	I'm saying that from this day until my last, I am and always will be violated.

SYDNEY	But I am not a victim. I am a survivor who is taking responsibility for my behavior. I need Terrence Berry to take responsibility for his.

CEDRIC	Deontay.

DEONTAY	What's up?

CEDRIC	How them math problems going?

DEONTAY	They're all right.

CEDRIC	Good? (scoffs) Hey.

BRONWYN	What's up?

CEDRIC	Can I holler at you for a minute?

BRONWYN	That's really all I have for you right now, Cedric. A minute.

CEDRIC	Look, I--I came up a certain way. You know, you do what you gotta do to survive. So I did what I would have done. I taught little badass a lesson in survival...

BRONWYN	But you...

CEDRIC	But--that's my life. And I don't got nothing to do with you trying to do here. I'm sorry for disrespecting that. For real.

BRONWYN	Apology accepted.

CEDRIC	That's it? "Apology accepted"?

BRONWYN	I--I don't know what else you want from me.

CEDRIC	Nothing. I'm out.

BRONWYN	Okay.

EBONIE	Dude, use your key.

EBONIE	Ced, damn.

EBONIE	Why you... Ced ain't here. Bryce either.

NONI	I wanted to see you. Cedric told me you were coming up so you guys could get into the studio and make some music.

EBONIE	What do you want?

NONI	I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was in the band.

EBONIE	And I'm sorry that you didn't hear me when I say that I never wanted to see you again.

NONI	That's gonna be kind of difficult if you're hanging around my dorm. Wait--Ebonie, please, don't. Please, don't do that. I'd really appreciate it if you'd give me five minutes to say what I need to say.

EBONIE	Fine. You got five minutes to explain why you stabbed me in the back.

NONI	"King of Rock." 1985. Run-DMC's best. For as long as I can remember, I was the girl that wasn't invited to birthday parties. Who never said the right things, never fit in. I had to change schools because I was bullied so badly. My mom once said to me, "Stop taking those stupid comic books if you want the kids to stop attacking you." (soft laugh) Like getting beat up was my fault. And then I came here. And I got you as a roommate. And we liked the same classic hip-hop. Same crappy cheesesteak. We had the same dreams. Finally, somebody in the world who got me.

EBONIE	And you appreciated me so much that you had to screw me over to prove it.

NONI	I--I didn't screw you over.

EBONIE	Noni, stop. I got beat down. Okay? I had to have two surgeries. I still get bad headaches. And you knew everything. They were trying to break me. But you--you--you kept saying they couldn't. But they did. And while I was sitting at home, thinking about killing myself, you--you were playing my position. Now tell me that that don't sound like betrayal to you.

NONI	I wasn't trying to stab you in the back. I was planning his payback.

EBONIE	Whose payback?

NONI	Drum Major Asshole. I knew he always took pictures on his cell phone of the music sheets. So I waited for him to put his phone down or misplace it like he always does.

NONI	Then I grabbed it and mailed Mr. Diamond's composition to Clive Taylor.

EBONIE	So that's why y'all played the "Maze" song at the Battle of the Bands?

NONI	We had no choice after Southwestern Delta performed Mr. Diamond's composition before we did.

EBONIE	But wait, so--so you screwed your mentor over too? I really don't know who you are.

NONI	Did you hear me? Danny's gone. He hazed you and I got rid of him.

EBONIE	Yeah. Thanks. At least he's gone. I mean, that's--that's big. That's really big.

JASON AND EVA	(moaning and grunting)

JASON	Are you kidding me? Oh. It just keeps getting better and better. Wow.

EVA	(soft laugh)

JASON	Eva. (exhales) I can't even breathe. I can't. (sighs) Never a dull moment, huh?

EVA	Never. It's always something.

JASON	You want to talk about it?

EVA	(sighs) Do I want to talk about my career problems with you? No.

JASON	(soft laugh) I'm not sure how I'm supposed to take that. What, you don't think that I can relate to your issues?

EVA	When we're together, I can forget about my issues. I like that about us.

JASON	I mean, if we're ever gonna be more than just--this, baby, I want to know what's on your mind. Whether it be good or bad. Huh? So go ahead and tell me. What's bothering my baby?

EVA	Okay. In the last year, four female HBCU presidents were fired. Contracts paid out and gone.

JASON	And you don't want to be the fifth.

EVA	Precisely. And then Dominique Briggs comes along.

JASON	Who you talking about, the strip club owner?

EVA	How'd you know?


JASON	You can't be a male at this school and not know about those clubs.

EVA	Anyway, he comes along with an opportunity to bring some real money in. Now, if he delivers, I'm good here for as long as I want to be. But if he doesn't...

JASON	Well, then you're screwed.

EVA	And I have no desire to be the next member of the Fired Female Presidents Club. According to Dominique, if the audit clears, the university will get the money. Now, will the donors want something in return? Of course. Will it be something that I can't or shouldn't deliver? I certainly hope not.

JASON	Do you really not see that all Mr. Strip Club wants to do is get in your pants?

EVA	Thank you. Hm, thank you for proving that I should talk to you about my problems. I have to go to work.

EVA	Get dressed.

JASON	(laughs)

CARLTON	Thought I told my secretary to let you know my schedule was tight.

EVA	I just got out of a meeting with Bill Webster from the auditing firm.

CARLTON	You did, did you?

EVA	He's found a number of inconsistencies in the discretionary fund. Care to guess in which subaccount these inconsistencies were discovered?

CARLTON	The suspense is killing me.

EVA	The President's Office account.

CARLTON	Well, that can't be good for you. I imagine the press is gonna have a field day with that. Type of thing that can get someone fired. Or worse.

EVA	Yes, it's the "worse" that I'm looking forward to. They're already considering reporting their findings to the authorities. And when they do, I am going to make sure that they look back. Far back. Until it leads back to you and Thurgood Bradford.

CARLTON	(laughs) What makes you think I had anything to do with that?

EVA	(laughs) Let's not pretend that you won't do anything to get to your end. Means be damned.

CARLTON	Well, that's rich coming from someone who's crawled into bed, perhaps literally, with a man who owns a chain of strip clubs.

EVA	Dominique Briggs is a more honorable man than you will ever be.

CARLTON	Once you stop looking at him through those rose-colored glasses, ask yourself why he came forward with a cockamamie excuse for an audit at this moment in time. Hm? Yes, I know he asked for it.

CARLTON	The school has a history with Mr. Briggs. And it's history for good reason. Now if you'll excuse me...

DANNY	I was hoping I could speak with you.

CECIL	If the words "sorry," "sheet music," or "Battle of the Bands," are about to come out of your mouth, save them for whatever marching band'll have you.

DANNY	Have I ever given you a reason to question my loyalty?

CECIL	And Jesus called Judas to be a disciple.

DANNY	So that's it? You're not even gonna entertain the idea that someone else did this? Someone like that kiss-ass freshman you let into the band. Think about it. She's the only one who'd screw you to screw me.

CECIL	Son, here's the thing about responsibility. Nobody gives a shit about your excuses. Nobody cares about the why's, the when's, or the how's. They just want to know that you delivered. You were responsible for that music and it was stolen. You had to be held accountable for that.

DANNY	I am being accountable. I am standing here, begging you not to ruin my life for a betrayal that I didn't even commit, because I don't want to lose the only thing that I love. I stayed here another year rather than graduate so I can be GAMU's drum major one more season. This band is my life!

CECIL	You done?

DANNY	You know, maybe you never lost anything, is that it? Is that how you can be this callous?

CECIL	I have lost plenty. I have lost plenty.

DANNY	Yeah, well maybe you haven't lost enough. Maybe one day you will.

COACH HARDWICK	Thanks for coming in, Tiesha.

TIESHA	Thank you for making time for me.

TERRENCE	What're you doing here?

TIESHA	I go here, remember?

TERRENCE	You wanted to see me, Coach?

COACH HARDWICK	A lot going on, huh?

TERRENCE	Yeah. Crazy-ass girls ruined our banquet. I can't wait till this all dies down.

COACH HARDWICK	Sydney Fletcher and those other women. They didn't look crazy to me. They looked serious. Committed. Really showed me something. Now, I need you to tell me something. Do you remember asking?

TERRENCE	You don't ask a girl can you kiss her, Coach, you--you kiss her.

COACH HARDWICK	What about the other girl who went to the police department with Sydney?

TERRENCE	She's just mad because I hooked up with her roommate before I found out it was her roommate.

COACH HARDWICK	That girl was accepted to law school at Stanford. You don't think she understands the consequences of falsely accusing someone of rape?

TERRENCE	If she felt like she was threatened, then she should have screamed or some...

COACH HARDWICK	If you looking for screaming... I know. I know there were other girls. So why don't you do me a favor and say what happened, Terrence.

TERRENCE	(scoffs) Wow. You serious right now?

COACH HARDWICK	Look, man, I can't be a coach who keep players around who sexually assaults girls and don't take responsibility for it.

TERRENCE	So what? Huh? You kicking me off the team?

COACH HARDWICK	From the moment I sat down with your mother, boy, I treated you like you were one of my own, because I promised I would. But now, somehow, someway, we ended up in this shit-storm, because you keep giving me answers that don't make sense. But you know what, maybe it was my fault. Maybe I wasn't asking the right questions. Maybe I should have been asking how many girls have you assaulted?

TERRENCE	So you believe these tricks over me?

COACH HARDWICK	I believe I put 80 other athletes' education in jeopardy to stand by your side and you let me!

TERRENCE	And I let you have the best season since you been here, and I don't see you complaining about that!

COACH HARDWICK	Boy, clean out your locker. You're done. You're done.

TERRENCE	What am I supposed to do now?

COACH HARDWICK	I don't give a damn what you do. But right now, you better get your ass out my office before I end up in jail. Make me say it again.

TIESHA	Cheers to an epic win and the quarterback who made it happen.

BOJOHN	Oh, no, no, no way. I'm not drinking to that.

JUNIOR	Dude, you scored three touchdowns in the air and one on the ground. Just take credit when it's due.

MAN	Mountain Cat!

TIESHA	And do it quick so we can go party.

BOJOHN	It--but it just don't feel right, you know? Something awful had to happen to somebody just for me to get here.
JUNIOR	Stop it, bro. It's a sin for you to not thank God for His blessings just because He did it in a way you wouldn't have thought.

TIESHA	Amen.

BOJOHN	Hey, Tie, I'm just wondering. You and Terrence were together for a minute.

TIESHA	Stop yourself right there.

JUNIOR	So you're saying he...

TIESHA	Didn't I just say stop yourself, Big J?

JUNIOR	All right.

TIESHA	I'm changing the subject.

BOJOHN	Thank you.

TIESHA	I see your racist, asshole, abusive father wasn't there.

JUNIOR	Ooh. Change the subject again, Tiesha.

BOJOHN	It's cool, man. I never mind honesty. I know my father's an asshole. But he's also the man who was at every practice. Encouraged me in a way that only he knew how.

TIESHA	Well, since we're being honest, you don't need that asshole in your life.

BOJOHN	Go easy. He's still family.

TIESHA	We're your family now. And Alyssa, I guess. And we don't have to kick your ass to prove it. To family.

JUNIOR	To family.

BOJOHN	To family.

TIESHA	(laughs) Yes.

JUNIOR	I like Alyssa.

EVA	Is everything okay?

JASON	Never better.

EVA	How was your day?

JASON	It's over. I'm here with you. That's all that matters.

EVA	Should we take this upstairs?

JASON	No-no, I just, uh, sit.

EVA	Jason, are you sure you're okay?

JASON	Look, I know that, um, you probably thought that it wasn't the right time to tell me that you're getting divorced, but...

EVA	Jason.

JASON	Eva, the time is right--and I mean right now--for us to be together. And baby, I mean for real. Baby, will you marry me?

EVA	Jason.	

JASON	Look, I--I know your divorce isn't final, but...

EVA	Jason, I'm sorry. I--I--I don't know if I ever want to get married again.

JASON	(scoffs) Did your quick decision have anything to do with the money man?

EVA	What? No. And I don't appreciate what you're implying.

JASON	Yeah, well, I don't appreciate being played.

EVA	Being played? What--what are we, 12?

JASON	No, Eva, what we are is done.

EVA	Jason, don't do this. Come on, we both know...

JASON	You don't know shit. But I promise you, you will. Yeah, you're gonna.

CEDRIC	"And I ain't never had a street, dog. So I'm like..."

CEDRIC	One minute. "Like your..."

BRONWYN	Hey.

CEDRIC	What's up?

WOMAN	Hey, Ced.

CEDRIC	What's up?

WOMAN	Call me later, okay?

BRONWYN	So can I come inside?

CEDRIC	Uh...

BRONWYN	So where's your roommate?

CEDRIC	Ah, he went out hunting with his brother. You know, they do weird shit like that. (exhales) Why are you here, Bronwyn?

BRONWYN	Is it weird that I've wanted to kiss you ever since you solved that equation with me?

CEDRIC	Yeah, kind of.

BRONWYN	(soft laugh)

BRONWYN	Was that weird? Slow, okay?

CEDRIC	Okay.

BRONWYN	Wait, wait.

CEDRIC	I got you. Trust me.

BRONWYN	Kay. (moaning)

WOMAN	Girl, come on.

WOMEN	Yeah.

JUNIOR	Yo, Michelle. You wanna be my homecoming queen?

MICHELLE	(laughs) I'm going to assume that means "Congratulations on becoming homecoming queen."

JUNIOR	(laughs)

TAVARUS	She always...

MICHELLE	Yes...

JUNIOR	Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa, hold up. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. (grunts)

EVA	So I--I think we want to make sure that we get...

EVA	What is that?

MAN	Yo, is that a gunshot?

MAN	Hey, hey, turn the music down.

MAN	Campus 911?

WOMAN	Help! Help! I just walked up the steps and he's just lying there. I think he shot himself.

MAN	Okay, try to calm down. Tell me exactly where you are.

WOMAN	Second floor. Tubman Hall.

MAN	We're sending someone now.
MAN	We have a black, male student with what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He is deceased.

MAN	It looks like the quarterback.

MAN	Damn shame.

MAN	Just--just terrible.

MAN	What a waste.

MAN	Call Coach Hardwick.

COACH HARDWICK	Coach Hardwick. Dear God...
