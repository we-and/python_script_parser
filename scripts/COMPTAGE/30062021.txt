PASIPHAE	(running efforts, presence, breathing throughout entire scene)

ICARUS	(squirts) Father! Look how bright this one is!

DAEDALUS	Yes. It’s a pearlescent nautilus shell! A rare specimen! How was your catch today? Good. Someone is waiting for us to break her mold. Meet me upstairs!

ICARUS	(running efforts)

DAEDALUS	Hahaa!

ICARUS	(scares, then laughs)

DAEDALUS	Aaah. For you. 

ICARUS	(excited reaction)

DAEDALUS	Heh he he he. 

ICARUS	(laughs)

DAEDALUS	Ready?

ICARUS	(presence, effort when hitting the mould)

DAEDALUS	(presence, effort when hitting the mould)

ICARUS	(coughing, laughing) Who is she?

DAEDALUS	Hah hah. She is a mystery. An idea that comes alive in my hands. My purpose is to shape it, give it form and character. Yet once completed, it no longer does my bidding (blows) : it eludes me to seek her own meaning.

ICARUS	(laughs)

DAEDALUS	Many a time, my sculptures have a greater imagination than I do.

ICARUS	(presence)

DAEDALUS	(presence?)

ICARUS	(reaction, giggles)

DAEDALUS	Haah. We have a big day tomorrow.

ICARUS	Huh? 

DAEDALUS	You are coming with me to the palace. We'll bring the sculpture to the queen.

ICARUS	(gasp)

DAEDALUS	And since you’re about to come out of your shell...

ICARUS	Hooh! But how did you make the thread go through all the chambers?

DAEDALUS	Heh heh… I asked my little ants...

ICARUS	Hmmm. 

DAEDALUS	Never stop looking for answers, my son.

ICARUS	(yawns) Hm.

2 SALESMEN	(dialogues)

WALLA	(people in the street, marketplace… until 10:05:56:00)

ICARUS	Huh!

DAEDALUS	He he he. 

ICARUS	Whoa! Ha haa! Oooh!

DAEDALUS	(gets of the cart) Come!

ICARUS	Oh. Euhm. (jumps of cart) Huh. Mphf.

PASIPHAE	Masterful, Daedalus! I can barely conceal the effect you have on me. The clay comes to life in your hands. Look: she breathes...

DAEDALUS	(bowing) My queen.

PASIPHAE	(presence?)

DAEDALUS	(presence?)

PASIPHAE	(presence/running?)

ICARUS	Huh? Huh?!

GUARD	Master, the King awaits you.

DAEDALUS	I'll be back in a moment.

ICARUS	Uhuh.

MINOS	So you understand the situation, Daedalus: I need to take my precautions and preserve the honor of my name. The ominous creature needs to disappear, but we shall not offend the god that spawned it. I trust your hgreat mind to find a solution! Come back to me when you have a plan!

ICARUS	(reac)

2 PEOPLE 	(talking to each other on bridge)

ICARUS	The king did not wish to see our sculpture?

DAEDALUS	No. Queen Pasiphae asked for this piece.

ICARUS	The queen looked happy to see you... Are you also a friend of the king?

DAEDALUS	He is the King, I am his inventor. The palace of Knossos, which we visited today, I conceived it at the king's demand.

ICARUS	He should be satisfied. Or is he?

DAEDALUS	Minos is at war. 

MINOS		(vocalisation)

SOLDIERS	(war walla)

DAEDALUS	He lost his eldest son at the games in Athens two years ago. 

SOLDIERS	(vocalisation)

SON		(vocalisation)

DAEDALUS	And his son meant everything to the king. 

MINOS		(vocalisation)

DAEDALUS	He will never forgive the Greeks.

ICARUS	What is he going to do?

DAEDALUS	Avenge his son.

GUARDS	(something needed here?)

ICARUS	Hmmm. So does the king need another sculpture?

DAEDALUS	What the king has asked of me is not yet of this world. It is my duty to invent it.

ICARUS	(yawns) Huh. (giggles) (humming) Yeah. (efforts) Huh. Euh. Huuh? (laughing) Mmm. (running efforts)

DAEDALUS	Hmmm?

ICARUS	Huh!

DAEDALUS	This spindle of wool is for the princess.

ICARUS	Hoh!

DAEDALUS	You can deliver it to the palace, you know the way by now.

ARIANE	Aphrodite is playing tricks! I asked for a lover, not a child! What do you want?

ICARUS	(flustered) I... I am...

ARIANE	Icarus, son of Daedalus. Yes! I know that. (she sighs ostentatiously) Oooooh, I need a breather! (snaps her fingers) Refreshments! Flowers! Indulge me!

MAIDS		(reactions) Hurry… 

ICARUS	I was supposed to find the princess. That is you... Ariane?

ARIANE	Mh.
ARIANE	I am she and I must thank you for distracting me from this dreadful rehearsal! My musicians are tormenting me!

MUSICIAN	(reaction)

ARIANE	If only they had your father’s talent...   Oooh, is that for me?

ICARUS	Euh. Here, I believe this will help you weave your dress.

ARIANE	(shrieking with laughter) Icarus, you’re a doll! My servants take care of my tailoring! Run along and find them! Away! Quick now!

ICARUS	(running efforts)

ARIANE	Where we left off! 5, 6, 7, 8!

ICARUS	(laughs) (reaction)(laughing) Oooh!  Huh? Uh.

ASTERION 	(V.O.) I was waiting for you, Bird.

WALLA		(people in the background?)

ICARUS	(running efforts) I'm here. Come. Is it you speaking inside my head? (smiles) Euh, does that mean you can hear me too? Who are you? Why is the king hurting you? Can I...? No! Stay! Come back!

PASIPHAE	(do we need to hear something as Asterion suddenly runs away towards her?)

ICARUS	(gasps)

PASIPHAE	Asterion!... Oh, my Asterion! My sole refuge. I taste life again. (breathing)

ICARUS 	(V.O.)	Asterion...

PASIPHAE	(presence)

ARIANE	Servant! My bath turns cold! Oh! I should have recognised that particular aroma with my eyes closed. You reek of the cowshed... Good evening, Mother.

PASIPHAE	Watch your tongue, my child. You are not immune to the hazards of fortune... Perhaps a little hot water will warm your heart...

ARIANE	Ah! You’re concerned for my well-being now, are you? You’ve remembered you have a daughter?

PASIPHAE	My body remembers. When I carried you, our hearts beat in harmony. Those lovely times, someone else ago...

ARIANE	I understand your detachment... I must seem like a distant memory... Cold water... Huh! Nothing more invigorating! It would be a pity to deprive yourself.

PASIPHAE	(do we need to hear her giving labour?)

MINOS		Aah. (laughing)

ASTERION 	Not yet free...

ASTERION 	 Everything I need is here.

ASTERION	The only one that counts is yours.

ICARUS 	Mine?

ASTERION	The one that doesn’t glow at night.

ICARUS	Mmm. How will I recognise it? How will I recognise it? (laughs)

ASTERION (V.O.)	This way.

ICARUS	Huh! (smiles)

DAEDALUS	It is late.

ICARUS	(sighs?)

DAEDALUS	Listen... I know I haven't been there for you in a long time. Tomorrow, the King's construction will come to an end. We'll work together again, like before, I'll give you new riddles to solve.

ICARUS	(relieved sigh)

DAEDALUS	Now go get some sleep. I have a task for you in the morning.

ICARUS	(reactions)

DAEDALUS	Oh, and does this belong to you?

ICARUS	(reaction) Uh huh. 

DAEDALUS	I'll keep it for now. 

ICARUS	(reactions - until the end of the scene)

DAEDALUS	I don't want you to get hurt.

MINOS		Pathetic creature! 

MINOS	I have kept you in the shadows, in the bowels of my palace, hidden from the world. And now is the time for you to shine! Athens will soon be paying its heavy toll: seven girls and seven boys! Every year the Greeks will sacrifice their finest youths to me! And it is YOU who will give me my vengeance, the "Monster of Crete", my Minotaur!

ICARUS	(on the verge of tears) Asterion... we must save him!

PASIPHAE	There is nothing to save! Everything is in its rightful place.

ICARUS	(crying)

PASIPHAE	It is not he who is imprisoned. Asterion is the mask that covers their madness...

ICARUS	But why did my father do this?!

PASIPHAE	Your father is following the line drawn by fate. But you, Icarus, you still have a choice!

ICARUS	(breathing)

PASIPHAE	I see his light in your eyes!

PASIPHAE	Find another star, Icarus, it will shine for both of you!

ICARUS	But...

PASIPHAE	Do not lose yourself in the night! Go! Be gone! (she shoos him away)

ICARUS	But… (running away)

DAEDALUS	(efforts)

ICARUS	Huh. 

ICARUS	He doesn't look like that.

DAEDALUS	I know. Things aren't always what they seem.

ICARUS	I don't want any more of your riddles. And I don't...

ICARUS	I don't want to work with you anymore.

WALLA		(reaction)

THESEUS	(looking up to the sky) You seek to impress me?

THESEUS	(looking at Minos) Sad little King!

MINOS		Your death will make me happy.

THESEUS	My creator, God of the Sea will bestow his glory on me!

ARIANE	Daedalus, I need the plans of the labyrinth you built for my father!

DAEDALUS	I do not understand.
ARIANE	Theseus, the Greek Prince, will battle the Minotaur inside the labyrinth, he needs the plans to find his way out of the maze! I want him to succeed. Oblige me, Daedalus!

DAEDALUS	Alas, Princess, I cannot give you my plans.

ICARUS	(presence)

ARIANE	... I can’t believe my ears! You once agreed to my mother’s unspeakable request and tonight you refuse to help me.

DAEDALUS	If Theseus wants to battle the Minotaur, he will have to enter the labyrinth and he will lose himself. There is nothing I can do for him.

ICARUS 	(V.O.)	"battle the Minotaur"? But Asterion is not... No! I cannot let it happen!

ARIANE	Daedalus! Listen to the agony I’m in! Did you not invent the labyrinth? Give me the plans!

DAEDALUS	I'm afraid that is out of the question.

DAEDALUS	Icarus, think carefully.

DAEDALUS	What you hold in your hands is my work.

ICARUS	(presence)

DAEDALUS	Come, put back the plans where you found them and I’ll forget all about it.

ICARUS	Forget... it’s so easy for you. Isn't it?

ICARUS	... because you design, you craft, you build... but what for? What are you weaving in your hand?

DAEDALUS	Art cannot be burdened by such sentiments.

ICARUS	Art... Well, look behind you father! See the carnage you have left in your wake.

DAEDALUS	For 16 years, I’ve dedicated myself to passing on everything I know. And you still do not understand.

ICARUS	I understand that I got things wrong... I believed in your light, father, and you… you left me in the dark. To think that it was I who worried about being a bad son.

DAEDALUS	How dare you?

DAEDALUS	No-one will betray the secret of my labyrinth.

ARIANE	... But so full of promise! Where will it end? What’s the point of sleeping when you're tired to pretend!

ARIANE	Slumber will find you before it comes to me.

PASIPHAE	Ariane, have you seen your father?

ARIANE	Huh?

PASIPHAE	I must speak with him!

ARIANE 	(V.O.)	Oh! 

ARIANE	(reactions, giggling throughout entire scene)

ARIANE	 (V.O.)	So, the night of possibilities is upon us! Mysteries and prophecies, rise up, come to life! If everything goes as intended: Icarus brings me the plans, I run to Theseus and I hone my argument.

ARIANE 	(V.O.)	To the labyrinth then, my heart forgives him, and his heart chooses ME!

ARIANE 	(V.O.)	Far away we sail, and the people of Greece bow down. The greatest beauty they’ve ever seen. I no longer answer to the name of Ariane...

ARIANE	Huh!

ICARUS	(presence, breathing)

MINOS	Daughter of mine, you are not blind! His golden locks, his brazen physique! If your gaze delights in him, who could blame it?

ARIANE	Poppycock! This Neanderthal Greek is so full of himself! Not my type at all.


ICARUS	(presence, breathing)

MINOS	Splendid! So, you won’t give a damn when you watch on as he is swallowed up by the labyrinth tomorrow!

ARIANE	Tsss…

ARIANE	So everything is lost!

ICARUS	Ariane, stop. Where is Theseus?

ARIANE	Don’t even say his name, you wretched boy!

ICARUS	(reaction)

ICARUS	(sighs)

ICARUS	I didn’t come to convince you... 

ICARUS	I must talk to Theseus. He will understand.

ARIANE	But what fate do you have in mind for the prince? Without the plans, he’ll never find his way out of the labyrinth!

ARIANE	And I've seen us leaving together, hand in hand...

ARIANE	... But to let go of his hand is to lose him...

ICARUS	Ariane! The spindle my father gave you, do you still have it?

ICARUS	Don’t forget our agreement!

PASIPHAE	(presence)

MINOS		My queen, I cannot conceal the pleasure your visit bestows on me...

MINOS		I’ve lost my appetite.

PASIPHAE	Since the sight of me inspires disgust, I’ll make it brief. Theseus will not back down from anything to save his people. Do not permit him entry into the labyrinth!

MINOS	What delicious beverage so intoxicates me that I hear such sweet words in my ears?

MINOS		An order from the queen! (barks with laughter)

MINOS	I had no idea you had become so close to the enemy... although you are hardly famed for your loyalty.

PASIPHAE	Minos! Kill Theseus before it is too late! Save Crete from this insult!

MINOS		So many efforts to come here and defend the honour of Knossos...

MINOS		And here you are, reptile, begging me.

PASIPHAE	Athens took your son, don’t let her take mine!

MINOS	PITIFUL	WENCH! Do you think for one second that your despicable mongrel matters? That your treachery deserves my pity? Let him die! Let them all die! Nobody will get out alive!

PASIPHAE	(reaction)

PASIPHAE	Enough! Must hate never end? Have we not endured your vengeance enough? Minos, I beg of you! Punish your queen, punish me!

ARIANE	(whispering) There, we're here.

ICARUS	You need to create a diversion!

ARIANE	No, no, wait here. I will go and fetch him.

ARIANE	You have given me inspiration this evening, Icarus.

ARIANE	 May it not desert me!

ICARUS	(reaction)

ICARUS	(presence)

THESEUS	Temptress!

ARIANE	Really! Is that how you greet a princess where you come from?

THESEUS	I expect nothing but ruse and deception from the daughter of Minos.

ARIANE	Who do you take me for?

ARIANE	It was sheer curiosity that lured me here to look more closely at the face of reckless bravery...

ARIANE	I said face...

THESEUS	Yours is incapable of lying...

THESEUS	You’re rather ahead of yourself to be celebrating my victory against the Minotaur...

ARIANE	No doubt I must have reason to count on it...

ARIANE	Test me out.

THESEUS	I’m really not in the mood to finish off another creature...

ARIANE	Only half a reckless man then... At last I understand the amputated nature of the demigods.

THESEUS	You insult my blood when it resists your charms...

THESEUS	And yet... My appetite is awakening.

ARIANE	Would you take me for your last meal?

THESEUS	Never. I can go without.

ARIANE	At ease! I’ll leave the Athenian boor to his own devices. I shall be gone.

THESEUS	A proud woman only stiffens my indifference.

ARIANE	Adieu, Prince... My dance offends you. I’ll draw the curtain.

THESEUS	Ariane! Stay!

THESEUS	Fortune has guided you this far. Let us speak plainly.

ARIANE	Only if your eyes promise not to turn away again...

THESEUS	The vow... The poison of women, whose antidote is pleasure.

ARIANE	Theseus! In the heart of the labyrinth, is not venom preferable to agony?

THESEUS	(bringing his mouth to hers) My daring will guide me.

ARIANE	In the meandering night, your eyes will seek in vain...

ARIANE	... Only touch will save you!

ARIANE	Prince of Athens, take the hand I offer you and see our destinies forever  entwined.

ARIANE	(breathing)

THESEUS	(breathing)

DAEDALUS	(presence, sighs)

DAEDALUS	Icarus…

ARIANE	How drole they are! Ha ha, not at all! I assure you, it is my natural colour. Ha		ha!

GUARDS	(react to what Ariane is saying)

ICARUS	(reaction?)

ICARUS	Huh. (+ presence)

ICARUS	(sighs, presence)

THESEUS	(reaction)

PASIPHAE	(crying)

DAEDALUS	(reaction)

DAEDALUS	(reaction)

PASIPHAE	Daedalus... Yes... My witness... That night in the forest...

DAEDALUS	Yes, I was there with you.

PASIPHAE	... The beloved will find a place among the stars... won’t they?

DAEDALUS	I don't know... and I fear my talents are no longer of use to you now.

DAEDALUS	Not even to find my son.

PASIPHAE	(gasps)

DAEDALUS	(reaction)

DAEDALUS	Icarus! WAIT!

PASIPHAE	(reaction)

DAEDALUS	Pasiphae... What have we done? (presence)

ARIANE	(presence)

ICARUS	I entrust this horn to you. You alone can venture to the centre of the labyrinth. When you find him in the dark, I hope it will glow, and if it glows, you will see the truth.

ICARUS	...and he will be saved.

ARIANE	Theseus, the labyrinth awaits.

THESEUS	Let the princess lead the dance.

ICARUS	Don’t waste any time!

ARIANE	(embraces Icarus)

ICARUS	(reaction)

ARIANE	If we come out of this trial alive, 

ARIANE	Perhaps you will follow us...

ICARUS	I think my place is elsewhere.

ICARUS	But I will prepare the ship for your escape.

ARIANE	We’ll see you then on the pier when we set sail.

ARIANE	(running efforts)

ARIANE	(presence)

ICARUS	(running, reactions)

ICARUS	Huh huh.

ICARUS	(efforts)

ICARUS	(efforts)

ICARUS	(efforts)

ICARUS	Huh.

DAEDALUS	Oh.

ICARUS	(efforts)

ICARUS	Oh, Icarus!

ARIANE	(reaction, disgusted by Theseus)

THESEUS	(redo breathing for the entire sequence - until 11:04:20:18)

PASIPHAE	(breathing, presence)

ARIANE	(reaction)

ICARUS	(reaction, presence)

ICARUS 	(V.O.)	Asterion...

ICARUS	Huh

WALLA		(servants reactions in corridor: shouting, crying)

MINOS		(snoring)

GUARDS	(shouting, running)

ICARUS	(presence)

MINOS		(running, reactions)

MINOS		You… MMMMMMM

DAEDALUS	No.

MINOS		(sighs)

DAEDALUS	I thought I lost you.

ICARUS	I might have lost myself. He was my only friend.

DAEDALUS	Nothing is lost forever. Things end to start anew.

DAEDALUS	The way out of the labyrinth is to follow your own truth.

ICARUS	My truth... How will I recognize it?

DAEDALUS	Haven't you been weaving it all along? If Asterion still exists, I trust that you will find him. Aren't we all made of the same matter: the earth and the air, the ants, the bees and the seagulls.

ARIANE	(breathing)

THESEUS	(breathing)

ICARUS	(presence needed?)

THESEUS	(we should already feel him here)

THESEUS	(presence)

ARIANE	(sighs)

ICARUS	(breaths)

DAEDALUS 	(V.O.) Each piece is a mystery, an idea that comes alive in my hands. I shape it, give it form and character.

ICARUS	(inhale)

ICARUS	(inhale + exhale)

DAEDALUS 	(V.O.) Yet once completed, it no longer does my bidding: it breaks free to meet its own destiny.

DAEDALUS	(blows)

DAEDALUS	Many a time, its imagination is far greater than mine.
ARIANE	(presence)

ARIANE	(presence)

ICARUS	(reaction, presence)

ICARUS	(sighs)

ASTERION	Would you believe it my brother. This blinding light. Unlike no other. A prison there was none. No more than there was fire. Four sad walls be gone. Burnt upon the pire.

DAEDALUS	(sighs)
