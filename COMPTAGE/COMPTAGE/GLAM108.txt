Glammys School Of Fashion vlog EPS 108

DAVID	Eh...hi! What do you think of me? I learned all that I know about life from surfing. I believe that the sea can make you stronger than all the others.

REBECCA	(Sigh) How cute!... Hi David

DAVID	AH! yeah, ehehe...ehhhh greetings! (to himself) Greetings? How geeky was that? 

REBECCA	David, Daviddd

DAVID	So I’m going back to su-rf...eh...uh

DAVID	I have a little house on the beach to exhibit the surf boards that I design and make! Mancuso left me the house, he really cares about my boards...

MANCUSO	They are beautiful, David, but this last one is missing something...more vitality, maybe. 

DAVID	Vitality...

BOTH	Good evening, headmaster!... (Laugh)

MANCUSO	hmmmm good evening guys..

DAVID	Ehm, vitality...

AMBRA	hi David, what are you looking at?

DAVID	Vitality...

VICTOR	I know just what you need to come with us

DAVID	I love my friends. When classes are over, often they come to meet me and we celebrate.

CARMEN	Here you are, you finally came

DAVID	Uh, someone really insisted

KEY	Come on, sit down with us

REBECCA	Hi

DAVID	Thanks..oh

REBECCA	Ahm

CAMI	(Chewing)

CARMEN	Camiiiii

ALL	(Laugh)

DAVID	Here is the vitality. The inspiration that I was missing. The most beautiful surfboard came out of it: but I never sold or even used it. I know to whom I want to give it

REBECCA	So, David, what are you saying on your Vlog?

DAVID	Who...me? What... I was just finishing...ehm...greetings!
