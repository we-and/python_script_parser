DENNIS	So, how was your date with Michael?

RACHEL	Can't call it a date, Dad.

RACHEL	Come on, we just meet.

DENNIS	Well, what should I call it then?

RACHEL	A shared dinner engagement.

DENNIS	Oh, come on.

DENNIS	Engagement, date, what's the difference?

DENNIS	All right, all right, what time does Sadler come?

RACHEL	Three o'clock.

DENNIS	Three o'clock, oh, I'm so busy then.

RACHEL	No, Dad, no.

RACHEL	No, he needs to see the clinic in action.

DENNIS	Why do I have to sell the clinic?

DENNIS	I don't need the money.

RACHEL	Because if you don't sell the clinic,

RACHEL	you're never going to retire.

DENNIS	Is that so bad?

RACHEL	Yes, Dad, please.

RACHEL	Come on, this is for your health.

DENNIS	My health?

DENNIS	Look at me, I'm fit as a fiddle.

RACHEL	Okay, I can't keep having this conversation.

RACHEL	I got a chihuahua in two.

DENNIS	Okay.

RACHEL	Dad.

DENNIS	What, he's cute.

DENNIS	I got a barn call, I'll be back.

MICHAEL	Enjoy, bon appetit.

TODD	Ole!

MICHAEL	Hey!

EMMA	Whoa, Baryshnikov, you wanna tone it down a little?

EMMA	You've been buzz'n since you got in here.

MICHAEL	So?

MICHAEL	Life is good.

MICHAEL	I was also thinking about making Christmas dinner.

EMMA	I'm pretty sure that's my gig.

MICHAEL	I know, but you do it like 365 days a year.

MICHAEL	I'm pretty sure you can take a break.

MICHAEL	I was also thinking about inviting a few people over.

EMMA	Rachael?

MICHAEL	No.

MICHAEL	Todd.

EMMA	What?

MICHAEL	Todd's got a crush on you.

EMMA	Yeah, I noticed that.

EMMA	Yeah, yeah.

MICHAEL	Should I?

EMMA	Invite Todd?

MICHAEL	You serious?

EMMA	What?

MICHAEL	Rachael.

EMMA	Oh, yes.

EMMA	I think you should invite Rachael.

EMMA	But I'm gonna be cooking.

MICHAEL	Whatever.

EMMA	I'll leave you with that.

BOTH	Yeah.

MICHAEL	You serious?

MICHAEL	Come on, man.

SADLER	Are you sure these rooms can handle farm animals?

RACHEL	Oh yeah.

RACHEL	We had goldfish in here this morning.

RACHEL	And our facility does offer on-site services

RACHEL	to dozens of different farms in the area

RACHEL	with plenty of room to grow.

RACHEL	It's just that my Dad, he slowed down a little bit.

SADLER	Good.

SADLER	And the asking price?

RACHEL	Well, I mean, it's negotiable,

RACHEL	but honestly, it's really fair.

RACHEL	I mean, we're giving you an established clientele

RACHEL	and a storefront.

RACHEL	You know, my dad has built this place

RACHEL	over the last 40 years.

RACHEL	It's a little comfortable.

BRAD	I know she's here.

BRAD	I hear her voice.

BRAD	Hey.

RACHEL	Brad, what are you doing here?

BRAD	Wow, good to see you too.

BRAD	Brought you some roses.

RACHEL	Nope.

BRAD	Aw.

BRAD	Hey buddy.

BRAD	How you doing? 

BRAD	Thomas.

BRAD	Rachael's boyfriend.

SADLER	Doctor Sadler, potential buyer of the clinic.

BRAD	Doctor, come on, you gotta be kidding me.

BRAD	You look a day over 18.

BRAD	You really buying this place?

BRAD	Wow, your daddy giving you a little loan?

SADLER	I'm paying cash.

BRAD	Wow, Doctor Sadler, here's my card

BRAD	and I think I might have a deal for you.


BRAD	You like the islands?

BRAD	The concert in Norman's Cay, Memorial Day Weekend

BRAD	and I happen to have a few extra VIP beach houses.

BRAD	And that's exclusive, that's just for you.

RACHEL	Oh, Twinkie!

RACHEL	Watch it.

BRAD	Oh, thank you.

BRAD	You know these shoes are pretty expensive.

RACHEL	You!

RACHEL	You stood me up and you didn't even call.

BRAD	Sweetie, I dropped my phone in the Ocean

BRAD	and a shark ate it.

BRAD	I miss you.

BRAD	Come on, sweetie, I miss us.

RACHEL	See right there, that is the problem

RACHEL	because there is no us.

RACHEL	There's only Brad.

BRAD	I know, it's been hard for me

BRAD	and I'm still not use to exposing myself to someone.

RACHEL	Literally, you know you have problems.

BRAD	Come on, sweetie.

BRAD	I know I've made mistakes and I've really thought about it.

BRAD	And now I know, I know what I want.

BRAD	I want you.

RACHEL	Brad, I'm not an asset.

BRAD	Come on, sweetie.

BRAD	Let's travel the world.

BRAD	Let's live on an island.

RACHEL	No no no no no.

RACHEL	You, you want to live on an island.

RACHEL	I like it here, I'm comfortable.

BRAD	You're comfortable?

BRAD	In this dump?

BRAD	No, you're not.

BRAD	You're trapped and I'm the guy that's Holding

BRAD	that door wide open for you.

RACHEL	Oh yeah?

RACHEL	If it's open, why don't you go use it

RACHEL	and just leave me alone, okay?

RACHEL	I got a pug with a personality disorder

RACHEL	so I have to go.

BRAD	Okay, can I call you?

RACHEL	From the belly of a shark.

BRAD	That's why I love you, Rachael.

BRAD	And nothing's gonna change that.

RACHEL	Brad, wait!

BRAD	Oh, oh no.

BRAD	Where is that little...

BRAD	I'm gonna be around for the holidays, okay?

SOPHIA	I'm never coming out, Dad.

MICHAEL	Come on, you were great.

MICHAEL	Nobody even noticed.

SOPHIA	Oh see, you noticed.

RACHEL	Hey Sophie, it's Rachael.

RACHEL	So you know, some of the most successful people in life

RACHEL	make the most mistakes.

RACHEL	Because they are always trying

RACHEL	and they use their mistakes to make themselves better.

RACHEL	So, if you messed up but you gave it your all,

RACHEL	well, then you've got nothing to be ashamed of.

RACHEL	You have to believe in yourself.

RACHEL	I know I believe in you.

SOPHIA	You do?

RACHEL	Yeah, I do.

SOPHIA	Thank you.

DENNIS	What is a marsupial?

DENNIS	Hey, thank you.

DENNIS	I hear Brad's back in town.

RACHEL	Shark ate his phone.

DENNIS	That makes perfect sense.

DENNIS	Who is Charles Darwin?

T.V.	Who is Charles Darwin?

DENNIS	What did you say?

RACHEL	We're done.

DENNIS	Oh good.

DENNIS	Cause it'd be very strange me dating Donna.

RACHEL	Dad, you know that she just tolerates you, right?

DENNIS	No no.

DENNIS	You know, you've been on a playground, right?

DENNIS	You know the way a girl pretends not to like the boy

DENNIS	so the boy likes her.

DENNIS	Same concept, it's classic Doctor Spock.

RACHEL	The Vulcan?

DENNIS	Him too, mm-hm.


DENNIS	Any man that doesn't treat you like the Queen of England,

DENNIS	off with his head.

RACHEL	Oh.

RACHEL	Hello.

RACHEL	Oh, no, Michael, it's me.

RACHEL	I was just...

DENNIS	Hi, yes.

DENNIS	Tell him to live long and prosper.

RACHEL	No, I haven't eaten.

DENNIS	Ooh!

RACHEL	Yeah, yeah.

RACHEL	I can come over for dinner.

DENNIS	What is an invertebrate?

DONNA	No, veggies give her gas

DONNA	and I'm talking silent but deadlies

DONNA	that'll coat your nostrils for days.

DONNA	So, what are you gonna do about Rachael?

BRAD	Well, she's not speaking to me right now.

DONNA	You think your father and I always got along?

BRAD	No.

BRAD	I mean, I'm not sure.

DONNA	Has

DENNIS	sold the clinic?

BRAD	He had a young doctor looking at this afternoon.

DONNA	Hm, any idea what it's going for?

BRAD	Two million.

BRAD	Wow, you're kidding?

BRAD	Gee, another millionaire in town.

BRAD	It's been so lonely on top.

BRAD	How long you staying?

BRAD	I don't know, maybe a couple weeks.

DONNA	Oh good, I'm taking a New Years cruise.

DONNA	So you can stay and watch Mrs. Pickles.

DONNA	Oh!

RACHEL	I literally can't eat one more bite of this.

SOPHIA	Emma's a really good cook.

RACHEL	She really is.

TODD	Let me grab these for you guys.

RACHEL	Thank you.

SOPHIA	Oh, I will help.

RACHEL	She's adorable.

MICHAEL	Yeah, she says I smother her.

RACHEL	Okay, my dad says the exact same thing.

RACHEL	I don't think that would call that smothering though.

RACHEL	I mean, look, I get it.

RACHEL	I'm a little protective, but he's all I got.

RACHEL	When I was young, he would put us in the car

RACHEL	and we would drive around for hours

RACHEL	with absolutely no destination in mind.

RACHEL	We would just go and explore

RACHEL	and go rock hunting and we'd go see caves.

RACHEL	And we'd go on picnics.

RACHEL	We'd do everything together.

MICHAEL	Sounds to me like driving wasn't the thing that he loved.

RACHEL	Yep, I never thought about it like that.

MICHAEL	To driving.

RACHEL	Here's to driving.

SING	? Merry Christmas, darling ? ? I heard you're doing well ?

MICHAEL	Oh, oh okay, yeah.

MICHAEL	Rachael, may I have this dance?

RACHEL	Yes, you got me.

RACHEL	You may.

MICHAEL	What kind of man do you think I am

SING	? ? Merry Christmas, sweetie ?

RACHEL	A little switch-a-roo.

MICHAEL	No.

RACHEL	You are.

MICHAEL	This is not.

RACHEL	That was a switch-a-roo.

MICHAEL	This is not my doing.

RACHEL	It's not?

TODD	Would you like to dance?

EMMA	Me?

TODD	Yeah, you.

TODD	Who do you think I'm talking to?

SOPHIA	No, Dad, I have to ask her something.

MICHAEL	No.

SOPHIA	Why not?

MICHAEL	Because I said so.

SOPHIA	You are acting a kid.

MICHAEL	You don't need Rachael to sing better, all right?

MICHAEL	Can we just stop talking about this? Please, I wanna eat.

SOPHIA	Okay, you okay?

MICHAEL	Yeah, why?

SOPHIA	Okay, say it, don't spray it.

DENNIS	How you holding up?

RACHEL	Not working, not working.

DENNIS	You finally get what you want,

DENNIS	and now you don't know if you want it anymore.

RACHEL	I know that I want this thing off my finger.

DENNIS	You call Michael?

RACHEL	No.

RACHEL	Dad, I don't know what I'm gonna say.

DENNIS	Sounds to me like you've already made up your mind.

RACHEL	Dad, it just happened so fast.

DENNIS	Love's a bullet, baby.

DENNIS	Don't let it take you down.

RACHEL	Dad, I really hurt him.

DENNIS	He'll understand.

RACHEL	And what if he doesn't?

DENNIS	Do something.

DENNIS	Tell him how you feel.

DENNIS	Yeah?

DENNIS	You're not gonna get him back standing here talking to me.

DENNIS	This...

RACHEL	Yeah.

DENNIS	Oof, try some coconut oil on that, all right?

RACHEL	Coconut, okay.

DENNIS	Who loves you?

RACHEL	You.

DENNIS	I do.

EMMA	You okay?

MICHAEL	I'm fine.

EMMA	Do you remember when we were kids

EMMA	how I use to break out in hives every time we went camping?

EMMA	Mom and Dad could not figure out what I was allergic to

EMMA	and we had to leave the campground every year

EMMA	and go get a hotel.

EMMA	About 10 years ago I figured out what it was.

EMMA	Stress.

EMMA	And I'm sorry that I wasn't there.

EMMA	I know when she died, that was really hard on you,

EMMA	and I should've

MICHAEL	No no.

MICHAEL	No, look at me.

MICHAEL	I'm happy.

MICHAEL	Come here.

MICHAEL	I love you.

EMMA	I love you, too.

EMMA	I forgot to set the alarm at the cafe.

EMMA	So I'm gonna turn that off.

MICHAEL	No no, I'll get it.

EMMA	No.

MICHAEL	Yeah yeah, listen.

MICHAEL	Please, go chill with Sophie.

MICHAEL	The pageant's coming up and she's like...

MICHAEL	She's says I'm hovering over here.

MICHAEL	I make her nervous.

EMMA	She said that?

MICHAEL	Mm-hm.

EMMA	Yeah, okay.

MICHAEL	All right, cool, I'll see you there.

EMMA	Mm-hm, I'll see you.

MICHAEL	Bye.

EMMA	Bye.

ELLEN	Got it!

PASTOR	Okay, just a little left.

ELLEN	I got it!

PASTOR	Just a little bit more right.

ELLEN	I got it.

PASTOR	Just a little bit right.

ELLEN	Don't got it.

ELLEN	I'll fix it.

RACHEL	It looks like maybe you could use a little help.

PASTOR	I think you could more than I.

RACHEL	Yeah, I think I'm just gonna cut the whole finger off.

PASTOR	I have shears in the green shed if you wanna.

RACHEL	Oh okay.

RACHEL	Look, can I ask you a question?

PASTOR	Always go with your instinct.

RACHEL	My dad said the extra same thing.

PASTOR	Wise man.

PASTOR	Look, whatever you decide, just consider the fact

PASTOR	that there are three people affected by this decision.

RACHEL	Three?

PASTOR	You, Michael, and Brad.

RACHEL	Brad.

PASTOR	You may not wanna be with him,

PASTOR	but you have to consider his feelings too.

RACHEL	Yeah, and now on the other hand, Michael.

RACHEL	Yeah, I don't think that he's gonna forgive me.

RACHEL	I mean, I lied to him.

PASTOR	Sounds like a pickle.

RACHEL	Pickle, Mrs. Pickle, she's so cute, right?

PASTOR	Who?

RACHEL	The dog, no?

RACHEL	Nevermind.

RACHEL	So, what do I do?

PASTOR	First, we start by being honest with yourself.

PASTOR	And then you go be honest with them.

RACHEL	And what happens if they both leave me?

PASTOR	Then neither one of them was right for you.

PASTOR	God works in mysterious ways.

RACHEL	Yes.

RACHEL	You're good, you're good.

PASTOR	Actually I need some refreshments picked up

PASTOR	from Brad's house.

PASTOR	Might be a good time to go clear the air?

RACHEL	Yeah.

RACHEL	Okay.

RACHEL	I really wish that I could get this ring off my.

PASTOR	Mysterious ways.

BRAD	Rachael?

ACHEL	Hello Brad.

BRAD	What are you doing here?

RACHEL	Okay, two things.

RACHEL	One, I gotta pick up the cookies.

RACHEL	And number two, I really wanna talk.

BRAD	Yeah, well, the last batch is cooking.

BRAD	Gingerbread men.

RACHEL	Oh, you made gingerbread men?

BRAD	I did.

BRAD	And one of them attacked me

BRAD	and Mrs. Pickles barely saved my life.

BRAD	She gassed them out.

RACHEL	Oh stop.

DONNA	Brad, who's at the door?

DONNA	Oh, Rachael.

RACHEL	Hi Donna.

DONNA	Hi.

DONNA	Is DENNIS going to the show tonight?

RACHEL	I suppose.

DONNA	Well, I mean, not that I care.

RACHEL	Of course not.

DONNA	Who said I did?

RACHEL	No one.

DONNA	Well, there's a formal event,

DONNA	and I should get ready.

DONNA	I'd like to look my best,

DONNA	but not for anyone special.

RACHEL	Who would it be for?

DONNA	No one.

RACHEL	Yeah.

BRAD	Rachael, sweetie.

RACHEL	Yeah, look, listen.

RACHEL	Come here, I really wanna talk to you about this

RACHEL	because this has really been weighing really heavy on me.

RACHEL	And well, I can't marry you.

BRAD	Oh, well why not?

RACHEL	I don't love you.

BRAD	Okay, so then you hate me.

RACHEL	No, I don't hate you.

RACHEL	We're good friends

RACHEL	and we're really good at being good friends.

RACHEL	Just with no commitment.

RACHEL	I mean, there's a lot of love here.

RACHEL	I'm just not in love with you.

RACHEL	And, well, I finally know the difference.

BRAD	I get it, I do.


RACHEL	Look, despite everything that we've been through,

RACHEL	I really do think you are gonna make

RACHEL	an amazing husband some day.

BRAD	No, no, I'm not.

RACHEL	Why?

BRAD	You can keep the ring, it's a fake.

RACHEL	Yeah, I know.

BRAD	And I wanted to marry you because I'm broke.

BOTH	What?

BRAD	I made a bad business investment with Tony Bruno.

BRAD	I borrowed $200,000 and if I don't get it back to him,

BRAD	this will be my last Christmas.

DONNA	And why didn't you tell me?

BRAD	Mom, because you're always hovering around me.

BRAD	I mean, you're always paying things.

BRAD	I need some space.

BRAD	The music festival was gonna be my way out.

BRAD	But it flopped.

BRAD	And the artist didn't even show up,

BRAD	and I had to refund everybody's tickets.

BRAD	I'm sorry for everything.

RACHEL	I know, I know.

BRAD	All right, I'm gonna go get the cookies.

RACHEL	Okay.

DONNA	Well, I guess this is the Eve for coming clean.

DONNA	So, tell your father to save a seat for moi.

RACHEL	Okay.

DENNIS	Excuse me.

MICHAEL	Sorry, we're closed for Christmas Eve.

DENNIS	No, I'm not here for the food.

DENNIS	Dennis, we meet the other night.

MICHAEL	How are you, Dennis?

DENNIS	How are you, man?

MICHAEL	Good.

DENNIS	Do you have a second that I could maybe talk to you?

MICHAEL	Sure, have a seat.

DENNIS	Okay.

DENNIS	Just take a minute.

MICHAEL	Sure.

DENNIS	I'm sure Rachael's talked to you about her mom.

MICHAEL	Mm-hm.

DENNIS	Elizabeth, spectacular woman, outstanding.

DENNIS	Every much like Rachael.

DENNIS	Independent and resilient and thickheaded, yeah?

DENNIS	When we met, she was engaged

DENNIS	to the high school quarterback star.

DENNIS	He had a giant scholarship to Yale, right?

DENNIS	I was this scrawny kid.

DENNIS	I had no business picking up the homecoming queen.

DENNIS	Much less, Bobby's finance, right?

DENNIS	But man, I was driven, you know?

DENNIS	She really make me feel alive.

DENNIS	I heard no a lot more than I heard yes,

DENNIS	but being the tenacious son-of-a-gun that I am,

DENNIS	I persisted and eventually I stole her from Bobby, right?

MICHAEL	Dennis.

MICHAEL	I get it.

DENNIS	Okay.

MICHAEL	But she didn't tell me about Brad,

MICHAEL	and I have to protect Sophia.

MICHAEL	I've only dated one woman since Sophia's mom passed.

MICHAEL	And when things went wrong and affected her,

MICHAEL	I just have to be really careful right now.

MICHAEL	That's where I'm at, you understand that, right?

DENNIS	Yes, and I commend you for that.

DENNIS	I mean, that was very honorable.

DENNIS	But Michael, everybody make mistakes.

DENNIS	She thought BRAD was long gone.

DENNIS	And speaking for myself,

DENNIS	I never thought he was in the running in the first place.

DENNIS	All right, I know I'm rambling.

DENNIS	Dennis, come on, get to the point.

DENNIS	Okay, the real test of love is forgiveness.

DENNIS	Can you forgive her for what she did?

DENNIS	Because I've never seen her act the way she's acting

DENNIS	around another man.

DENNIS	And Michael, that makes you special.

DENNIS	That's my whole spiel.

MICHAEL	And I appreciate you.

DENNIS	All right, thanks for taking a minute to listen to me.

MICHAEL	Merry Christmas.

DENNIS	Merry Christmas.

MICHAEL	You look great.

MICHAEL	Thanks.

EMMA	How you feeling?

SOPHIA	Like I'm gonna mess up.

EMMA	You're not gonna mess up.

EMMA	You just have to remember everything you learned.

RACHEL	Sophia.

SOPHIA	Rachael.

RACHEL	I just wanted to say go get 'em.

RACHEL	Yeah, you're gonna be great out there.

RACHEL	How you doing?

SOPHIA	I'm still nervous.

RACHEL	Yeah, well, listen, just breath

RACHEL	and remember when it gets to that E,

RACHEL	sing from here, right?

RACHEL	Yeah, okay.

RACHEL	And one thing I didn't tell you,

RACHEL	you have to always sing from here.

SOPHIA	Thank you.

RACHEL	Yeah.

RACHEL	Okay, go break a leg.

SOPHIA	Okay.

RACHEL	She's amazing.

EMMA	She is.

EMMA	So was my brother.

RACHEL	Yeah.

RACHEL	Woo, it's really hot in here, isn't it?

RACHEL	Kinda a little hot.

RACHEL	I'm up here having to say something

RACHEL	and I realized I am making a fool out of myself.

RACHEL	It's kind of embarrassing.

RACHEL	Michael, I lied and I hurt you.

RACHEL	And you don't deserve it.

RACHEL	And well, what I wanna say to you

RACHEL	is that this happened so fast

RACHEL	and this was just so unexpected.

RACHEL	You know, what I realized is that I have been in love

RACHEL	with an idea of something.

RACHEL	I didn't even know what it was until I met you.

RACHEL	From the moment we met, you have just lifted up my heart,

RACHEL	and I have not been on solid ground since.

RACHEL	It's really beautiful.

RACHEL	And it's really scary.

RACHEL	And I think the most terrifying thing

RACHEL	would just be that if you left

RACHEL	and I didn't say I am so sorry.

RACHEL	I am so sorry.

MICHAEL	A wise man once told me

MICHAEL	that a true test of love is forgiveness.

RACHEL	A wise man, huh?

MICHAEL	Mm-hm.

MICHAEL	He's always meddling.

BRAD	Tony, relax, I'm getting ya the money.
