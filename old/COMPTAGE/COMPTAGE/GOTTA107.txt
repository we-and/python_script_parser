BRENDA	Thank you, Jesus. I didnít think you were coming. I know itís hard to see her like this.

NOLA	How is Shemekka doing?

BRENDA	The Doctor say She has an infection in her blood and they giving her antibiotics and medicine to maintain her Blood pressure.

NOLA	Iím so sorry Miss Brenda.

BRENDA	I donít understand how this could have happened. I keep asking Shemekka how your Butt grow so from Pancake to Big Bottom? I knew something wasnít right. She works hard. She has a nice Hostess job at Applebyís in Downtown Brooklyn. How does she end up getting some Back-Alley Butt injections and dancing at some damn Strip Club? Shemekka tries to act so tough, but she is mush inside. Sheís a Mother. She donít have a lot of friends. And I know she tells you everything. You must know something...

NOLA	Iím sorry Miss Brenda.

CLORINDA	Hey Girl, itís Clo. What happened to you? Why did you run out last night? Anyway, let me be the first to Congratulate you. You did it. You had your First Show. I am proud of you. And you helped set the Diastopian on Fi-yah!

CLORINDA	Donít worry about the Julius Kemper Review. Just know, I donít completely agree. Love, Love, Love!

JULIUS KEMPER	I am bursting with excitement. I want to flap my wings! An outstanding Group Show curated by the talented Clorinda Bradford opened last night at the New Medina Gallery in Dumbo, entitled ÒDiastopiaÓ which is a New Movement, coined by Miss Bradford, that I am overjoyed to learn about...  Blasian - I believe thatís the Correct Term ... meaty textured Blak on Blak... made Pop.. CJ Walker...Hot Comb... Iron...

NOLA	Ahhhhh!

JULIUS KEMPER	...arresting Mugshots ñ pun intended... entitled A Reckoning, a direct response to Black Lives Matter... Which brings me to the problem of The Show and its weakest link... Ha! Nooooola Daaaaarling... You heard right the first time. You, Nola Darling, are The Weakest Link. Stop fast forwarding! Ms. Darlingís Work seems almost out of place and overshadowed by the fierce Trifecta of African-American Artists. Her selection of Work is pedestrian compared to the electrifying political perspective of her Peers. I had the opportunity to speak with Miss Darling about her selection of works which she has presumptively entitled ÒThe Free Female Black Form” and she was decidedly unable to articulate its meaning in any cohesive manner. Is it any surprise? How does one encapsulate the Free Female Black Form? To her credit, Ms. Darling has ample facility. Itís not a question of Talent or Skill. Not by any means.

NOLA	Oh, Thanks.

JULIUS KEMPER	Perhaps her Artistic Eyes were bigger than her Stomach. Letís be frank, not quite working with the same intensity as her Diastopian peers and with no unifying principles, Ms. Darlingsí selection of Works are Disparate, Disjointed and Diluted. I donít want to know who Ms. Darling is inspired by, I want to know who Ms. Darling is.

NOLA	Fuck Julius Kemper.

GREER	(re: book) Itís not what you think. What do you want me to say? Sometimes being this Good Looking can be a burden. Sometimes, it can attract unwanted attention but Iím used to it. Nola and I met a year ago. She wasnít even interested. That was a big Turn On. And Iíve been Turning her on ever since. As Nola likes to say, weíre Fuck Buddies and with that come Fuck Buddy Codes. She has her Rules. We donít really Hang Out. We may not be exclusive but Iím about to change that. Last night I saw a different side of Nola. Now I see more than just her Body. I see the Woman inside. I saw Nola in her World. I saw a Woman in her Element, Self-Possessed. Sheís Special. Hey, itís one thing to be Fucking in her Loviní Bed, itís another to be in the Real World together. I know thereís some other Dude sheís hanging with. His Punk-Ass was probably orbiting last night at her Show. But I didnít see any competition, except for maybe that Woman. I gotta admit Iím not used to working this hard. But, Iím up for the challenge. Why wouldnít she want to be with me? Iím a great Bonjour, Mademoiselle Nola, Cíest moi, Greer. Cherie, Felicitations! Call me back.

SEPTIMA	Sweetheart, this is Mommy and Daddy calling. We are so proud of you. Your Father made your favorite Greasy-Ass breakfast. Stop by.

JAMIE	Nola, I hope my presence was a pleasant surprise. I promise it wonít be the last. Call me.

TERRELL	Congratulations! Youíve been initiated. Listen, forget Julius Kemper. Heís a Bitchy Troll!

MISS BRENDA	Nola, this is Miss Brenda calling. Shemekkaís conscious and sheís asking for you.

GREER	Nola, Cherie, Call me back.

OPAL & SKYLAR	(Opal and Skylar chanting) Money is coming! Money is coming!

MARS	Yo,yo,yo, Nola. Wassup. Wassup. Yo, I ainít Mad at you for not invitiní me. I hope you ainít mad at the Kid for standing up for his Femme Fatale. On the sincerious tip, how Ôbout a make up Call? Holla at Ya Boy.

NOLA	Who is it?! I canít hear you! Stop ringing my bell! Go away you Jehovahís Witnesses! Iím down with Jesus! Are you kidding me? What The Fuck! What the Fuck are you doing here, Greer?

GREER	Somebody had a long night. Are you going to let me in?

NOLA	No, Iím not gonna let you in and I donít appreciate you showing up unannounced.

GREER	But you didnít answer my Calls or Texts.

NOLA	Boy Bye.

GREER	Baby, can you please open the door so I can talk to you?

NOLA	Greer, did I not set the Rules? And didn you not agree to those rules?

GREER	All you do is Break the Rules.

NOLA	Whatever. Iím not in the mood for a Booty-Call.

GREER	Iím not here to be in you Loviní Bed. Letís go out and celebrate your triumphant debut. How about Dinner? Go to a Film? Whatever you like. I just want to show you a nice time. Cinema. Old or New?

NOLA	Old. Shot in Black and White.

GREER	Okay, a Film. Iíll Text You.

NOLA	I didnít commit to that.

GREER	You just did. Ravishing.

NOLA	Come on, I donít want to miss the previews.

GREER	Are you okay?

NOLA	Iím fine.

GREER	You have this ÒJe Ne Sais Quoi.

NOLA	No, not again.

GREER	Come on, get in here.

NOLA	Thatís Sweet.

GREER	Bisou. Merci. Youíre so Fuckiní Sexy. I just want to devour you.

NOLA	You ainít so Bad yourself.

KRISHNA	Bonjour Greer! How are you?

GREER	Hey Krish!

KRISHNA	Ginger Elixirs. On the house!

GREER	Nola, Krishna, Krishna, Nola.

KRISHNA	Youíre Beautiful!

NOLA	Thank you. So are you!

GREER	Nola just had her first opening last night. It was a huge success. Weíre here to celebrate. Sheís an amazing Painter. You and your friends should come down and see her work. In fact, you should tell Monsieur Benoit he should buy her Work and put it on the wall. Sheís going to be huge.

KRISHNA	Ah! Congratulations! Iíll be back in a Jiff to take your orders.

NOLA	Guido! Guido! So you got your Harem King Solomon. Quíest-ce quíil yía à manger?

GREER	Ooh la, la. You speak French now? Your accent is So Cute. This place is Vegetarian, Gluten and Dairy Free. Is that okay? I want you to try something of these Vegan Dishes. Itís my Cheat Day. Try this. Fennel Sausage. Aduki Bacon. Itís all Beans. Bon Apetít.

NOLA	Thatís very good. Iíve never had that. I donít mind Vegetarian but Iím an Omnivore.

GREER	I may be Vegetarian but Iím a Carnivore in Bed.

NOLA	Youíre a Cannibal.

GREER	You Damn Right! A ta Santé and Congratulations on your Superb Show. So that was quite a turnout last night. How do you think it went?

NOLA	It went well. I was in Good Company. It was a little nerve- wracking. But I was Happy to be a part of it. It would have been nice if one of my Pieces had Sold.

GREER	It was quite a Scene. Iíve never seen you like that before. I wish you had invited me.

NOLA	It wasnít about you. It was about my Work. You had no problem getting in.

GREER	I can talk my way into anywhere.

NOLA	What a Gift.

GREER	Was your other Dude there? He probably got an invite.

NOLA	Yes, She did. I donít ask you about your other Women.

GREER	What do you want to know?

NOLA	I donít.

GREER	That first time you sketched me, What did you see?

NOLA	I donít know. I saw Shapes, Colors, Lines, Contrasts, Shadows, Contours and Negative space.

JAMIE	Smells good.

CHERYL	I picked up your Suit from the Dry Cleaners.

JAMIE	Thanks. Whereís Virgil?

CHERYL	Heís at Conorís.

JAMIE	Tastes good too.

CHERYL	Parent Teacher Meetings are next Thursday. Do you want to go or shall I?

JAMIE	As long as that White Liberal Asshole Headmaster ainít gonna be there.

GREER	In France, you donít enter the room wearing your Race on your sleeve like you do here. You donít really have to chose. You can be both. When I moved here as a Child it was a difficult transition.

NOLA	What? Thereís no Racism in France?

GREER	Iím not saying it doesnít exist. But itís more Binary here. So youíre upset because the Critic said your Work is Pedestrian?

NOLA	Basically. I have no Clear Voice and my Work didnít fit in with the Theme of the Show. Not cohesive. Not Black enough.

GREER	A French Critic would never have that critique. But, Cherie, you did have Three that very different pieces. How do they connect?

NOLA	They just do.

GREER	I want to know.

NOLA	How do you say, ÔCheck Pleaseí in French?

CHERYL	Goodnight.

JAMIE	Gínight.
GREER	Actually your Work wasnít like the other Artists. Thatís what I Loved about it. Theirs was Blackity- Black-Black, Iím so tired of that and then yours was... Nolaís Point of View. Fluid.

NOLA	Yes. Exactly. Thank you. This Guy thinks heís the authority on Blackness. The Black Female Form.

GREER	I love your Form.

NOLA	Heís calling my Blackness into question. As if thereís one singular representation. Like Iím not Black enough.

GREER	Yes, I understand completely.

NOLA	I got singled out by this White Critic Asshole for not expressing his version of The Black Aesthetic. What the Fuck does he know?

GREER	Yes! See?  Cherie, this is what Iím saying. We have a lot in common. Like the way I get criticized by Black people for not being Black enough. And I feel like that Iím always having to prove my identity and choose a side. And if I chose do I deny my French Mother? Does it mean I am not Black? What about my African-American Father? The Man was a Black Panther.

NOLA	Itís just fucked up. Commercially the space is dominated by White Folks. Theyíre The Gatekeepers. They get to decide whatís Good and whatís Not.

GREER	Can you feel how hard I am right now? Itís Fucked up. I just want you to be resilient. I Love how you have the Courage to put your Work out there. I want the same for myself. Commercial Photography is disposable. Just appeasing the Clients.

NOLA	The Gatekeepers. What are your Artistic Aspirations?

GREER	I want my Work to be Immortal. Iíd like to have a Show one day too. Or a Book. Something personal. personal.

NOLA	Why donít you?

GREER	It takes courage. I guess Iím caught between wanting to move forward and wanting the stability of being able to Eat and have a roof over my Head. I donít want to lose my Net.

NOLA	Sometimes you have to jump without the net. But, I can understand that. Itís a Hustle.

GREER	Well, apparently not, if your Art isnít Selling.

NOLA	You know, I was waiting for the Old Greer to rear itís Ugly-Asshole head.

GREER	Cherie, donít. Stay. Sit.

CHERYL	What are you doing? Why are you in my Bathroom?

JAMIE	Can I join you?

CHERYL	Shut the door.

LILY	Your coat.

GREER	Thank you.

NOLA	Whatís this? Who are you today? Awww, thatís so sweet, Greer. This is pretty ...

GREER	Do you remember?

NOLA	Of course I remember. Thank you Greer.

GREER	I know the Title is a bit shocking but itís actually a Novel about two young Black roommates, these Francophiles living in the slums of Montreal during the 1980ís. One is Writer and the other one sleeps a lot and quotes the Qurían and Camus. They donít have to do much because all these young White women throw themselves at them.

NOLA	There you go.

GREER	ÒMiz NolaÓ, I donít want them, I want you. I want us to do this more. Go out on Dates. See Movies. Together. What do you say?

NOLA	You know Greer... I just feel like I need to be somewhere else. I canít...

GREER	... Cherie? Why?

NOLA	I canít... do this right now.

KRISHNA	Anything else I can get you Two Kids?

NOLA	Nope.

KENSIE	Greer! I Love The Headshots.

NOLA	Ciao, Guido.

SHEMEKKA	Bitch, are you drunk?

NOLA	What?! No!

SHEMEKKA	Why are you shouting?

NOLA	Shhhhh. Weíre in a Hospital.

SHEMEKKA	Iím sorry I missed your Show.

NOLA	Iím sorry I missed yours too.

SHEMEKKA	You ainít missed nuthiní.

NOLA	You didnít either actually.
