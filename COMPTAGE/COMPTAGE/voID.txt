WOMAN	No.

VINCENT	He won’t get far.

WOMAN	No.

DISPATCH	What’s the good word, Carter? You still awake?

CARTER	Ah... In the middle of a high speed chase, so this better be important. 

DISPATCH	just feel so good knowing you’re out there keeping us safe.

CARTER	Any news on your end?

DISPATCH	There’s a mess of chatter from state police, but it sounds like they’ve got it under control. Anyway, you’re about up, so we’ll see you when you get in.


CARTER	Okay. Hold on. Looks like I got some kind of a drunk teenager or, I don’t know... Hey! Hey buddy, you know it’s a little cold to be crawling all the way home.  Standby.  Big night, huh? Holy shit! Dispatch, where am I taking this guy?

DISPATCH	Closest emergency services is still Marsh County. Not sure what’s left of it after the fire. I think they’re moving but they’re still listed on duty.

CARTER	Okay uhh, how about Lakeland?

DISPATCH	It’s another 20 minutes at least. It’s your call.

CARTER	Okay, you call ahead to Marsh, let them know that it’s me bringing him in. You call ahead.  Can I get some help here?

ALLISON	Uhh Bev, I need hands up front! Bring a stretcher.

CARTER	Did dispatch not call ahead?

ALLISON	What? We didn’t get a call. 

CARTER	No?

ALLISON	Bev uhh, wanna get his feet? 

BEVERLY	Yep, I’ll get em’.

ALLISON	One. Two. Three.  Are you okay? Can you hear me?

BEVERLY	What’s his story, Danny?

CARTER	Uhh, he’s bleeding, Bev.

ALLISON	I’m gonna take care of you. Uhh Beverly, we gotta get him on a monitor and in to see Dr. Powell. Let’s go.

CARTER	Oh. Hi.

CLIFF	What’s that about?

KIM	Who knows. They won’t let me do anything around here. Ouu, here’s a good one: ‘Degloving.’ There’s a picture.

CLIFF	Ugh, Jesus.

KIM	ou know statistically, you’re more likely to die in a hospital than anywhere else.

CLIFF	Cool.

KIM	I could give you a catheter. That could be fun.

CLIFF	Are you even a nurse?

KIM	I am in training.

CLIFF	That’s so cool but I’m just gonna go to sleep. Kay?

KIM	I should go anyway. Guess you won’t be needing this. Goodnight!


BEN	Ahh, you sure know how to make an entrance, Danny boy.

CARTER	Yeah. How you feeling Maggie?

MAGGIE	I’ve been having some pains. Dr. Powell says the baby might be on its way.

BEN	Yeah. He’s kicking up a storm in there, that’s for sure. Anyhow, I’m just glad the Doc stuck around. That fire really did a number on the place, and I can’t afford to be driving her into the city every time the kid gets fidgety.

MAGGIE	 Give it a rest, Grandad.

JAMES	No! No! LET GO OF ME! LET GO OF ME! STOP!

ALLISON	Calm down!

JAMES	LET GO OF ME! 

DR. POWELL	One more thing. 

JAMES	STOP!

DR. POWELL	Just one more thing. 

ALLISON	Breathe. Breathe.

DR. POWELL	Okay.

ALLISON	Not gonna miss this.

CARTER	Gonna be able to handle him, Richard?

DR. POWELL	Your friend here has had quite a trauma.

ALLISON	Ah, not that we have and I.D. bracelets left, but for the record his name is James.

CARTER	How bad is he?

DR. POWELL	Well, he’s not been very cooperative. The sedative will help us determine exactly what his condition is. But uhh, our resources are limited here. Everything’s been packed up for the move. 

ALLISON	Looks like James here isn't any stranger to needles. Where’d you find this guy?

CARTER 	He fucking bled on me.

BEVERLY	Kim, I know getting transferred over here wasn’t your first choice, but you’re supposed to be boxing up files. 

KIM	You know, there are things called computers now.

BEVERLY	Can computers put files in boxes? Thank you.

KIM	So old school.

ALLISON	You might need something a little stronger if you’re going to get that stain out..

CARTER	No,no... This is the—Whatever fuck. I can do my own laundry. 

ALLISON	Wow, look at you. Brought you a coffee.

CARTER	Nice. I was looking for that. 

ALLISON	It’s mine now. So don’t you get any ideas. 

CARTER	Right. You’re being friendly.

ALLISON	It’s good to see you.

DR. POWELL	Ahh, I’m sorry. Am I interrupting something?

ALLISON	No. No, no, no. I’m just gonna go make sure Bev hasn’t murdered my intern. I’ll uhh, see ya.

DR. POWELL	Our guest is out for now. Uhh, he’s not badly hurt but it will be a while before you can talk to him. 

CARTER	Fuck.

DR. POWELL	You should be gentle with Allison. She’s still coming to terms with what happened.

CARTER	Yeah, okay.

DR. POWELL	As you know Daniel, there’s nothing worse than losing a child. When we lost Sara I was uhh-- I was a mess. It took a long time to come back from that. You just have to keep going.


CARTER	Yeah. Beverly? Are you okay? Beverly? Jesus Christ. What the fuck are you doing, Bev? Beverly?

BEVERLY	This isn’t my face.

CARTER	What-- Bev! No, no! Don’t do that! Put the scissors down! Look at me! Bev! Okay, stop!

BEVERLY	It’s not me. 

CARTER	No, no, no! Don’t do that! Bev.

BEVERLY	Can you help me?

CARTER	Bev. Bev. Stop. No, no, no! Beverly, stop! Oh fuck...

ALLISON	Daniel. Daniel! What did—What did you do?

KIM	What the fuck?

ALLISON	Kim. Kim, get out of here. Kim, you don’t need to see this.

CARTER	She killed him. I-I uhh—She came at me. She came at me. Okay?

KIM	Cliff? I was just in here.

DR. POWELL	Was that a gunshot? My god! What happened!?

CARTER	I don’t understand. Her fa--

ALLISON	Beverly. She-She attacked Daniel and the Robinson kid.

CARTER	I’ve gotta call this in. I’ve gotta call this in.

ALLISON	Give yourself a second, okay? Just calm--

CARTER	Tell them I gotta—Just give me a sec. 

ALLISON	Can you just call from the office?

CARTER	Give me a sec. Ugh...

DR. POWELL	How are you feeling?

CARTER	What? I’m fine. I’m okay.

ALLISON	Just take it easy, Daniel. It looks like you might have had a seizure.

DR. POWELL	No, no, no, no. If you’re feeling dizzy, Daniel, you shouldn’t try to get up.

ALLISON	Just sit down, okay? Come on.

CARTER	I gotta call it in.

ALLISON	You need to take it easy. There’s a state trooper already here.

CARTER	What? How long was out for?!

DR. POWELL	Not long. Apparently he was already on his way.

ALLISON	Something to do with that kid you brought in. Look, it’s not important right now. 

DR. POWELL	This trooper’s probably gonna wanna talk to you, we should see about moving you to a room.

CARTER	No, no, no.

DR. POWELL	You’ve just experienced an extremely traumatic event--

CARTER	Okay.

DR. POWELL	Okay, look you are stubborn like your father was. You should take this very seriously.

CARTER	I am. I am. I’m good.

DR. POWELL	All right.

ALLISON	Daniel.

CARTER	Mitchell?

MITCHELL	There you are. So, what happened? They told me you found the two of them together?

CARTER	Uhh yeah, umm, he was dead when I arrived and umm, she came at me with a pair of scissors. How did you get here so fast?

MITCHELL	Your guy in the other room.

CARTER	What about him?

MITCHELL	We got a major bloodbath about 20 miles north of here. Looks like he tore the place up like a butcher shop.

ALLISON	Umm, yeah, We-We looked him over and most the blood on his body was not his.

MITCHELL	Well, he has a long list of drug-related priors. So, I think he gave your nurse something. I’ve got him cuffed to the bed for the time being.

ALLISON	Well, he’s been out cold.

MITCHELL	Well, I’m here now, I’ll sort it out. I need to take your firearm.

CARTER	Yeah. 

MITCHELL	You know Carter, your dad was a standup cop. Wonder what he’d think if he saw this shit show. Okay, we need to make sure everybody’s accounted for. Who else is here?

ALLISON	Umm, Dr. Powell and Kim. Oh, and umm, Ben and Maggie. She’s pregnant.

MITCHELL	Christ, what a mess.

CARTER	Hey uhh, do you mind if I call it in?

MITCHELL	All right.

CARTER	Thanks.

CARTER	I’m not getting through in here. Do you copy Mitchell? I’m gonna try the car.

MITCHELL	Copy.

CARTER	Dispatch, this is Carter at Marsh County. Do you copy? Dispatch, this is Carter at Marsh County. Do you copy? I have a code 3 and I need assist. Fuck! Hi!  What the fuck are you doing? Shit! Whoa! Whoa! Help!

ALLISON	Oh my god! DANIEL! Daniel! Daniel! RICHARD! He’s losing a lot of blood.

DR. POWELL	Keep pressure over the wound.

ALLISON	It’s fine. Look at me.

DR. POWELL	Kim, I need you to bring me a suture kit and eight milligrams of morphine.

ALLISON	Keep your eyes on me, you hear me?

DR. POWELL	Did you hear what I said?

ALLISON	Kim! Kim! What are you doing!?

DR. POWELL	Kim! Did you hear me!?!

KIM	Wh-What?

ALLISON	For fuck sakes! Come here!

DR. POWELL	You’ll be all right. You’ll be all right. Keep breathing.

ALLISON	Keep both your hands here, firm pressure!

KIM	Uh, okay...
 
ALLISON	Don’t stop. Keep him awake. Keep your eyes on him. Keep an eye on his eyes, all right?

DR. POWELL	That’s it! That's a good boy, Daniel. That’s a good boy!

ALLISON	Kim! Don’t let him close his eyes!

KIM	Hey! 

DR. POWELL	Stay awake, Daniel! Stay awake.

KIM	Stay awake. Hey!

ALLISON	Hey. Daniel.

DR. POWELL	I’ve stopped the bleeding for now.

ALLISON	Thank god.

CARTER	There’s someone outside.

ALLISON	Yeah, we know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Hey! Okay maybe, don’t try to get up just yet.

MITCHELL	What happened out there? 

DR. POWELL	Just give him a second. It looks like they got the place surrounded. They’re not trying to get in.

ALLISON	Who are they?

CARTER	I don’t know.

MITCHELL	I wasn’t able to get through? You?

CARTER	No.

DR. POWELL	We should move everyone back inside. Who knows what they want.

CARTER	M-M-Maybe we can uhh, barricade the doors or you know—Get out some other way?

MITCHELL	Shit, I forgot about him.

JAMES	Do something! Fucking shoot it! Oh my god, do something! Shoot it! Help me! Help me! Oh my god, fucking help me, goddammit! Help me! Help me!

MITCHELL	What is that?

CARTER	I think that was Beverly...

ALLISON	Jesus. What the hell was that?

CARTER	We’re leaving. Now. Now. Now. Now.

DR. POWELL	Hey! That’s not a good idea, Daniel. 

ALLISON	Wait, wait, wait! What about those lunatics out there?

CARTER	We’ve got other things to worry about. Believe me. Mitchell! Mitchell!  You and I, let’s go get the cars, okay! Are you with me?

ALLISON	Shit! Okay, just back up.

MITCHELL	What the hell was that?

CARTER	Make safe. Back up! Stay away from the doors! He’s got a gun.

ALLISON	Back, back, back.

CARTER	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Make safe! Make safe. Okay, okay, okay! Drop it! Whoa! Okay, drop it! Drop it!

VINCENT	Fuck you. 

JAMES	Get the fuck back!

CARTER	Okay, put it down! Whoa! Everybody just stay calm!

ALLISON	Stay calm, stay calm!

JAMES	Stay the fuck away from me!

CARTER	Okay, put down the gun, it’s okay. Everybody just calm down!

DR. POWELL	Calm down.

CARTER	Richard, Richard, Richard!

DR. POWELL	No, no, no! There’s no reason to involve her in this. It’s not gonna help you.

CARTER	Richard.

DR. POWELL	Listen; just give me the knife and this will all be over. This isn’t going to help you.

CARTER	Richard.

JAMES	I don’t know what the fuck to do!

DR. POWELL	Don’t worry, Maggie. He’s not going to hurt you. Just let me help you.

JAMES	Don’t tell me what to do!

CARTER	No, no, no, no, no!

ALLISON	Richard! Kim!

KIM	Here, I got him! I got him, Oh my god!

CARTER	Look at me, look at me, look at me.

JAMES	I’m not gonna die in this fucking place.

CARTER	Nobody wants to be here longer than we have to, believe me.

VINCENT	He’s not going anywhere.

JAMES	You think I’m a fucking idiot? You think...

VINCENT	What the fuck was that?

ALLISON	Sweetheart, you’re gonna be fine. You’re gonna be fine. Fuck sakes. 

CARTER	Mitchell!?

VINCENT	Shit!  Stay back!  Oh fuck.

CARTER	Get in the office. Get in the office, now. Now!

ALLISON	Help them. Get them!

CARTER	Okay, go to the office. 

ALLISON	What the fuck was that? 

CARTER	I’m not gonna argue with you! 

ALLISON	You need to tell me what was in there! 

CARTER	I don’t know! But please, just go!

VINCENT	Watch the door!

ALLISON	Okay, you hold on. Who are you?

VINCENT	Get the fuck away from me!

CARTER	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, just slow down. Who are you? Who are you, just tell us that!

VINCENT	I want him, all right?

CARTER	Okay, look, all right. I think we all agree that we need to get the hell out of this building, right? These personal differences—

ALLISON	Daniel!

CARTER	Fuck!

ALLISON	Stop!

VINCENT	No one is going anywhere.

CARTER	Okay, okay, okay.

ALLISON	Okay.

VINCENT	We don’t know anything about this place. If he led us here we can’t trust them.

ALLISON	You don’t need to do this! Can you get him to stop!

VINCENT	He can’t answer you. Show her!  See? That’s what the last people he trusted did.

CARTER	You’re making a mistake! You can trust us. You can trust us.

VINCENT	I don’t think so.

CARTER	You can trust us! Woah! Wait, wait, please! Please, woah, woah!

VINCENT	Take your hand off me!

CARTER	All right, you calm down! Okay, we’re good.

VINCENT	You wanna go through all this again? 

CARTER	You believe me when I tell you, we don’t know what the fuck is going on, okay! I, uhh, there were things growing out of her, you saw it! You saw it! What was that!?

VINCENT	We could burn what’s left place. Take em’ all with it?

ALLISON	Okay listen to me, we didn’t do anything to you. I have a girl back there who’s to give birth and I need to get her somewhere safe.

VINCENT	Are you fucking kidding? Have you had a look outside, lady? There’s nowhere to go. You could hear those horns for miles. There is something calling them all here.

CARTER	Okay, what is that? Who are they?

VINCENT	How the fuck should I know? No idea. Go ask them. Go ask em’!

CARTER	It’s okay! It’s okay! All I know is if that thing woke up once already, I don’t wanna be around when it happens again.

KIM	Uh, there’s a problem. Maggie. I didn’t know what to do.

ALLISON	Okay, hey, sweetie.

KIM	Are we leaving?

CARTER	No, not just yet.

ALLISON	Would you put that out?

CARTER	Al.

VINCENT	What this?

ALLISON	Yeah. Put it out.

CARTER	Okay, I think that uhh, we should all just remain calm.

BEN	Bullshit! We shoulda been outta’ here already.

VINCENT	You people need to wake up.

KIM	Or what?

VINCENT	You think you’ll stand a chance if there’s another one of those things out here? Will ya’, huh?

CARTER	Okay. Okay. Okay.

VINCENT	Who’s going to stop it? Grandpa? The teenage fucking slut! Come on then!

CARTER	Woah, woah, woah! Come on.

VINCENT	Come on then!

KIM	We’re gonna die...

VINCENT	No! We’re not gonna die. You’re gonna die.

CARTER	I’m not going to let that happen.

CARTER	It’s good.

ALLISON	Okay.

CARTER	It’s good. I don’t know what the fuck you think you’re trying to do, okay just calm down.

ALLISON	If he’s upsetting her and that is not good. Okay.

CARTER	Can you please tell me what’s going on over there?

ALLISON	Her contractions are still spread out, but she’s having abdominal pain which is a bad sign.

CARTER	I don’t know what that means. What does that mean?

ALLISON	That means that we can’t move her. It could make things much worse. The last thing that I need is to be performing a cesarean in the middle of this. But I have nothing here to help her and if I don’t do anything the baby could die. I need to go to the Med Supply Room. I’ll go.

CARTER	Alone? No, no, no.  That’s out of the question.

ALLISON	I’m not asking. We need to handle this now.

CARTER	All right, okay look, We have no idea what is out there. We have no way of defending ourselves, plus these two fucking psychos now think that we’re hostage. 

ALLISON	I’m doing this.

CARTER	You’re not. You’re not. You’re not eve—If this is because of the baby then you need to-you need to get a mental check.

ALLISON	Jesus Christ, Daniel! This is not about us. If that girl, if she suffers an abruption then her baby will die. If I try to take it out of her and I don’t use anesthetic then she could die of shock. Daniel, look at me.

CARTER	Okay fine, fuck it. Fuck it. Uhh. Okay, but you’re not going alone, you have to promise to wait for me, okay? You promise? 

ALLISON	Okay. 

CARTER	All right. May I approach? The girls’ not doing well and neither is the baby. So, we need to go and get some things to help her.

VINCENT	And what do you want from us?

CARTER 	Well, I have a shotgun in my cruiser. I have ammunition.

VINCENT	We just fought our way in here. I’m not just gonna stroll back out again.

CARTER	Okay but, As far as I can tell, we’re all in the same boat. You’ve got rifle without any bullets and a couple of fucking fire axes. It’s just, it’s close. And we can do it fast. 

VINCENT	All right, we’re not risking our lives for you. We get that gun, it’s ours.

CARTER	Oh absolutely. 

VINCENT	Abso-fucking-loutely.

CARTER	Okay. 

VINCENT	I thought you said it was close?

CARTER	What the hell?

VINCENT	They’re still out there.

CARTER	Yeah, but what are they waiting for?

VINCENT	Let’s just make this quick.

CARTER	The shotgun’s locked in the front seat. I’ve gotta release it but you get all the ammo out of the trunk.

VINCENT	Don’t get any bright ideas. Hold up, goddammit.

KIM	What if they don’t come back?

ALLISON	Daniel knows what he’s doing.

BEN	It’s all right.

KIM	I shouldn't even be here right now. I should be at Lakeland turning over patients. Fuck this place.

ALLISON	Well you’re stuck with us now, Kim, so deal with it. you doing, honey?


MAGGIE	It hurts. What’s gonna happen to my baby? 

ALLISON	Listen to me, you and your baby are going to be fine. You have my word.

CARTER	Okay, come on, come on, come on. Ahh, shit.

VINCENT	What the fuck are you doing in there? What the fuck's going on in there?

CARTER	Ughh, God, Shit. 

VINCENT	Okay, time’s up. That’s our cue to leave. COME ON GODDAMMIT!! For Fuck sakes! Fucking hurry up! 

CARTER	Look out! I’m keeping the fucking gun! This place isn’t going to keep anything out.

KIM	Oh my god. Hey, you’ll be okay. Fuck!

BEN	What happened?

KIM	Here. HERE.

CARTER	Where’s Allie?

BEN	Well, she went to get some medicine for Maggie.

CARTER	Where!?

KIM	The Med Room. 

CARTER	Jesus Christ. You fucking—

KIM	She said there wasn’t anything to worry about inside.

CARTER	Are you guys in the same fucking building?! Would you please wait here, look after them. Excuse me sir, would you mind following me? Thank you. kid will be fine.

VINCENT	He’s been through a lot worse. Those people killed his family. I barely got him out of there alive.

CARTER	Yeah? What about you, Man of Mystery?

VINCENT	Mind your own business. And by the way, pretty stupid to go running off by herself.

CARTER	Okay, I’m pretty certain you can beat the shit outta’ me but, I consider it my special privilege to hate my wife right now, so if you can kindly shut the fuck up! That’s Mitchell’s gun. Fuck.

VINCENT	What?

ANONYMOUS CALLER	Hello Daniel.

CARTER	Who is this?

ANONYMOUS CALLER	You saw... something. I felt it when you woke up. But what was it? I can show you more, if you like.

CARTER	Hi Richard.

DR. POWELL	I’m sure it’s hard for you to understand. Beverly found it difficult as well. But I assure you my intentions are altruistic.

CARTER	Please. Tell me what you’ve done? Richard. Richard, tell me! Tell me! 

DR. POWELL	You’re trying so hard to follow in your father’s footsteps, Daniel. Do you really want to follow him where he’s gone? I understand how desperate loss can make you. Allison to me. The life inside her, desperately clawing to get out.  Losing my daughter changed me. But-But I’m doing what I have to, to make it right. You’ll understand soon enough.

CARTER	Just please, can you please tell me where Allison is just-- You tell me goddammit! You tell me where she is!

DR. POWELL	Don’t worry, Daniel. I’m going to help her. I’m going to help all of you. 

KIM	This is crazy. I don’t know what I’m doing. You can’t just leave us.

CARTER	Kim, Kim, I don’t have a choice. Allison’s the only one who knows how to look after Maggie. Please, look, these still seem to work inside. 

KIM	No.

CARTER	We’ll keep in touch just in case. We’re not gonna be gone long, we’re not going far. Look.

MAGGIE	It hurts. It hurts, so bad!

KIM	I don’t know what half of this stuff is. Please! Please don’t! Please.

CARTER	Listen to me! Listen to me! Please! We’re just gonna go down there, I’m gonna bring back Allison and I need you to hold out until then, all right!?

KIM	What if something happens? What if those people get in here? What are we supposed to do?

CARTER	Those people are not trying to get in here. Those people are trying to keep us from getting out. Okay. That’s the best that I can do. Hope you know how to use it. And, uh, that’s there just in case.

BEN	You better know what you’re doing.

CARTER	Okay, let’s go.

VINCENT	You think we’re just gonna go down there, and that’ll be that?

CARTER	If you have something to say, then say it. You smug fuck. Do you know what’s down there?

VINCENT	No. But I know someone who might. Hey. Hey meth boy.

JAMES	Oh shit.

VINCENT	Oh good, you remember us.

JAMES	It’s not my fault, okay? You’ve got to believe me. I didn’t fuckin’ do anything.

CARTER	Just save it. Save it!

JAMES	Please help me. These guys are gonna kill me.

VINCENT	Hey! You’re gonna wanna pay attention to my questions.

JAMES	Please. No, wait, wait, wait! Oh God please don’t.

VINCENT	Alright, pick a finger.

JAMES	Don’t do this. No, no! You haven’t asked me anything yet!

VINCENT	I wanna make sure you know I’m serious.

JAMES	I believe you, okay?! I fuckin’ believe you!

CARTER	Okay, alright, hey! Do you know anything that will help keep us safe? Anything at all? Anything that will help us survive?

JAMES	It’s that fucking Doctor. It’s that fucking doctor!

CARTER	Okay, we know that already. We don’t have time for this!

VINCENT	Alright, you know what? Make it clean.

JAMES	No, no, please! It is him. It’s him, and I killed him. I swear to God, I did you a fuckin’ favour! 

CARTER	Yeah, well, he’s not dead anymore. How’s that possible?

JAMES	What? Oh God. No no no.

CARTER	Look at me! Look at me!

JAMES	Oh God!

CARTER	Look at me. Stop! Listen to me. How is he alive? What is he?

JAMES	I don’t fuckin’ know!

CARTER	Okay, take his hand off. 

JAMES	No! Please don’t! Please, please! I don’t know, I’m serious! I met some girl on the road! Please, please! I met a girl on the road and she told me she could help me score crystal, so I followed her to this fucking pill house. Except it wasn’t a pill house!

CARTER	What was it? What was it?

VINCENT	I	t was an old farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere. Full of these fucking junkies. It was a mess. Looked like they’d been killing people for a while.

JAMES	He gave us drugs. He watched us have sex. He called the place a church!

CARTER	Okay, what? You’re telling me Richard was some kind of sex fiend, religious thing? My dad knew him for years, we all did. That’s bull shit.

JAMES	They were dressed just like this. There’s a bunch of people dressed like this, okay? And they did killings and sacrifices, and they made us watch!

VINCENT	You talking devil worshipping?

JAMES	No. No, I don’t believe in the devil, but I believe in this. He made people change. I saw it. 

JAMES	Thank you.

CARTER	You’re coming with us. There’s no reason to thank us.

JAMES	What?

VINCENT	Yeah. You know what? We’re gonna visit your friend in the basement.

JAMES	No!

VINCENT	Mhm.

JAMES	Are you nuts? No! You’ve seen what he can do! Let’s just get out of here, okay? Fuck this place.

VINCENT	Yeah? Have a look. Go on. Be my guest.

JAMES	This is suicide. Oh my God. No! You’re as crazy as they are.

VINCENT	Come on.

CARTER	Yeah, maybe. Down here.

VINCENT	Looks like this place is gonna collapse.

KIM	Can you hear me okay?

CARTER	Loud and clear.

KIM	The stairwell to the basement is at the back of the building.

VINCENT	Roger that.

CARTER	Got it.

VINCENT	Look. Someone’s been here.

CARTER	Kim, where we going?

KIM	The door to the morgue--Should be right there in front of you.

CARTER	I don’t see any doors. It’s just a bunch of corridors. You sure this is--the right place?

BEN	He went down the wrong stairs!

KIM	There’s only one set of stairs. I know where they’re going. Hello? Carter?

VINCENT	She better not be leading us into a trap.

KIM	What’s going on?

CARTER	You gotta be kidding me.

KIM	Did you find it?

CARTER	Is there some kind of sub-basement or—

KIM	No. No. No. What are you talking about?

CARTER	There’s a staircase going down.

KIM	What? Fuck. Carter! Can you hear me!?

VINCENT	No. You gotta go back. I can’t ask you to follow me down here... You understand?

KIM	Guys, what’s happening? 

CARTER	Nothing. We’re gonna go down the stairs. Hey, hey meth head, hey, you get to go first.

JAMES	Yeah right.

CARTER	I’m not asking. Just be quiet! Go slow.

ALLISON	I... 

DR. POWELL	Don’t bother. You won’t be able to move.

ALLISON	...Richard? 

DR. POWELL	Be patient. I’m almost ready.

ALLISON	What-What... is this? I saw you... die.

DR. POWELL	I had no idea that it would feel like this. The years I’ve spent operating on people. Opening them up and stitching them back together again. It’s remarkable, the sensation. It’s not pain. More a sense of... release.

ALLISON	Why-Why... are you...?

DR. POWELL	Be quiet, please. This is uncharted territory. The chance to study my own transformation. I understand your hesitation, Allison. But let me ask you, all these years, haven’t you ever wished to save someone beyond saving, no matter what the cost? Well, losing Sara-- 

DR. POWELL	destroyed me. But it also-- compelled me to find a solution. You’d be surprised at the things you find when you go looking.

VINCENT	Smells like a grave.

JAMES	I’ve seen this place before...

VINCENT	This was all over the house we cleaned out.

JAMES	He made us look at things. The worst things I’ve ever seen.

VINCENT	We found rooms full of bodies in the basement of that place. They had someone on a-on a table like they were doing surgery down there. Half turned into one of those things.

JAMES	No. No. Worse than that. Like a nightmare. Like it wasn’t real. It’s not real.

VINCENT	It’s a rat’s maze. 

KIM	Carter!

MAGGIE	Is he here?

KIM	Hey, yeah...

MAGGIE	He has to be here for the baby.

BEN	I’m right here, kiddo. It’s okay. It’s all right. You’re gonna be fine.

KIM	You’re lucky your grandpa cares about you so much. My grandpa just yells at his TV and smokes.

MAGGIE	It hurts!

KIM	Shit.

BEN	Ahh! Please! Help! Please, help her. Help her. Please.

KIM	Oh shit. Okay. wait, wait! Uh, the Paradine, I think. Okay, Maggie, hold still for one second. I got this. Okay, I’m gonna give you something that’s really gonna help you, it’s gonna feel really good. You’re doing real good.

BEN	It’s all right, it’s all right.

KIM	It’s gonna be real painless. It’s gonna be okay in a second. 

BEN	Okay, okay.

KIM	Just give me a second! Okay, okay... You gotta hold her still. You gotta hold her still. Once I get this in, okay ready? There you go... Yeah. Yeah.

BEN	It’s okay.

KIM	There’s no problem. No problem.

VINCENT	Great.

JAMES	I’m not going in there. Fucking shoot me.

VINCENT	Hey!

CARTER	This is it?

VINCENT	This is what? I appreciate your enthusiasm but we need to think this through. This is a mistake. Come here you motherfucker.

DR. POWELL	Do you know where you go when you die? I do. You travel on, re-born into something else. Like a caterpillar becoming a moth. Until now, I’ve only been able to trap the moth in its cocoon. The body has to adjust, of course. Adapt. We weren’t built for this kind of thing. I-I admit, early on, I made mistakes. Some of those earliest mistakes are still down here with us. In fact, they caused the fire that destroyed this hospital. You see, they want to die. But I won’t let them. Don’t cry, Allison. I am going to help you. This is an end to the cycle of life and death. Do you really want this world? This world that took your son from you? Do you know what happened that night? To your unborn child? 

ALLISON	No please...

DR. POWELL	The umbilical cord became entangled. Simple as that. Strange, isn’t it? The very life line between you and your child constricting like a noose around its neck as it struggled to get out. Tighter and tighter, until finally it couldn’t struggle anymore. Nature’s futility.

ALLISON	No...

DR. POWELL	I can stop it. This is the first real step. A true resurrection. I lost my daughter to the abyss, but tonight I am calling her back.

ALLISON	Richard. Please... Don’t do this.

DR. POWELL	But it’s already done. You are so beautiful, Allison. You will become something truly remarkable.

VINCENT	This is a slaughter house.

JAMES	Get these things off of me!

VINCENT	Shut the fuck up! I should’ve killed you back at that house.

CARTER	Get a hold of yourselves.

BEN	Is she all right?

KIM	I don’t know, she feels hot. Oh god. Oh my God!

BEN	Oh my god! Do something!

KIM	Oh my God! Okay, okay! I got this. I can’t believe this is happening! 

JAMES	Please.

CARTER	Get ahold of yourself!

VINCENT	Fuck you. Look around us, huh!? I told you this was a mistake. He knows something.

WOMAN	We need you with us.

JAMES	He’s in his head! He’s in his head!

VINCENT	Shut the fu—

CARTER	Stop it!

VINCENT	We’re in hell.

KIM	You’ve got to hold her still! going to be okay. It’s going to be okay.  can do this. I can do this.

BEN	That’s the front entrance.

CARTER	Where are you going? Wait, goddammit!

KIM	I can’t! I can’t do it!

BEN	You have to!

KIM 	Fuck!

JAMES	I’m not gonna die in this place! What the fuck is that!? Noooo! Noooo!

BEN	You do what you have to do, I’ll keep those bastards out. 

KIM	I could kill her.

BEN	You have to do this! You are the only chance she has! 

KIM	No!

BEN	Please!

KIM	Sorry, I can’t!

BEN	Please! Do this!

KIM	Oh my god! Why did you do that!?

MAGGIE	It’s finally time.

KIM	How could you!? Your baby!

MAGGIE	Doctor Powell is a great man. I’m lucky to carry his child. Nothing else matters now.  Don’t worry. Everything is about to change.

KIM	Get the fuck away from me! Fuck!

VINCENT	Just-Just wait. Just-Just wait. What do-What do I have to do? Just wait. This is your fault. This is your fault! I wasn’t there! You should have protected them. Your mother wants us to stay. I told you what we have to do, we have to stay here. You should have protected them! Stay here! I’m sorry! What is this?

KIM	Carter. Carter. Carter. Carter. Carter. Carter! Where are you? Where are you?? Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Fuck!

ALLISON	Daniel… Where are you? Daniel.

CARTER	Allison.

ALLISON	Where are you? I’m scared.

CARTER	No, no, no, no, Allison. I’m right here. I’m right here. I’m right here. Look at me, it’s okay. Hi.

ALLISON	I can feel it coming. Hold my hand. I need you.

CARTER	I’m not going to leave.

DR. POWELL	Daniel. I know your secret. I saw it in your face the night Allison lost your child. I saw relief. 

CARTER	What have you done?!

DR. POWELL	I’ve given her what she wanted. She’s a mother. Isn’t she beautiful?

ALLISON	Daniel. Stay.

DR. POWELL	Do you see, Daniel? Tell me what you see.

CARTER	I see a monster that thinks he’s god.

DR. POWELL	I’m disappointed. All the things I’ve shown you, and you still don’t understand.

CARTER	No. No you’re right, I don’t.

DR. POWELL	I refuse to let death be the end. I defy god. There are things much older. Older than time. And they’ve blessed me.

CARTER	Well, congratulations.

DR. POWELL	I spent my life resisting death. But now I understand I must embrace it. I’ll have my beautiful daughter back. I just need one final thing... Come. Join me. The others have all gathered to witness my daughter’s rebirth. My Disciples, ready for their own transformation. You’ll experience it yourself. But first you have to die for me, like your father and son before you. You’ve done wonderfully, my dear.  Now, watch. You will be my audience. Watch the abyss open itself to me. 

MAGGIE	Come and bless my baby.

DR. POWELL	Place my daughter into this vessel. Yes... Give yourself to her. Let her come to me. It’s her. You see?

VINCENT	HEY! NO! Look out! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it.

DR. POWELL	We will all be saved. Everything has lead to this our apotheosis.  I can see it all before me, the infinite astral workings. It’s beautiful.  Don’t fight it, Daniel. I can give Allison to you. That’s what you want, isn’t it? She’s waiting for you. All you have to do is let go and you can be together. That’s a good boy. This isn’t the end.

CARTER	Yes. Yes. It is.

KIM	Is it over? Is it over?
