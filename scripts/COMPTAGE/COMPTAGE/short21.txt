THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching..? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	On Sodor it doesn't matter what the weather is like, the engines are always hard at work out on the tracks. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	But Henry's not out on the tracks today. Henry isn't very keen on a certain type of weather. He'd rather stay dry in the sheds! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	What kind of weather does Henry not like? Is it snow? Is it rain? Or is it sunshine?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Henry doesn't like the rain!

THE EARL OF SODOR	He doesn't like getting wet! But Henry needn't worry. Now Thomas has persuaded him to come out of the sheds, he's having a splendid time in the rain!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray! That was fun. Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Today, Thomas is working at the China Clay Pits. He needs to find the two brothers who work here. These brothers are identical twins, and very difficult to tell apart!

THE EARL OF SODOR	And they're both very cheeky. No matter how fast Thomas chuffs, he can't catch either of them! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Which two engines are brothers? Is it Percy and James? Spencer and Gordon? Or Bill and Ben?

THE EARL OF SODOR	The two brothers are Bill and Ben!

THE EARL OF SODOR	<laughs> And it looks like they're up to their tricks as usual!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh, jolly well done for playing! I look forward to seeing you again next time. Goodbye!5
