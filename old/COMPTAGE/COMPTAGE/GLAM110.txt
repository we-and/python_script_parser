(Glammys School Of Fashion vlog EPS 110)
     
VAN LINDEN	Ah the registration has begun... Hello everyone! I am Professor Van Linden, the jewel in the school’s crown. I say it without false modesty, I know. Everyone here loves me. There are students who come from the other side of the world to come to a school at which Professor Van Linden teaches. The students really love me an awful lot...I am a bit tough, I know.. but they respect me.
     
VAN LINDEN	Unfortunately, ladies.. the truth is that you have no style. 

REBECCA	But how is she always so scathing? I am really curious to see her style when she is at home.

AMBRA	Great Rebecca! Excellent idea! Let’s follow her!

VAN LINDEN	I live near the school, in an old villa I inherited from my family. But I love going to school in my Jaguar.

AMBRA	Look at that prehistoric dress!

REBECCA	Just as well we were the ones without any style

VAN LINDEN	(Reactions) 

GIRLS	(Laugh) 

VAN LINDEN	Don’t panic… Calm will help me come up with a solution... HELP ME!

REBECCA	Ambra, should we help her?

AMBRA	Hold on, I’m finishing filming her.

REBECCA	Come on, stop, poor thing let’s help her.

AMBRA	Oof, ok I’m coming.

VAN LINDEN	Ladies! What are you doing here?

AMBRA	Professor we have to tailor your dress

VAN LINDEN	Nooo!

VAN LINDEN	Ok girls, thank you very much... In the end, this dress is in any case out of fashion for thirty years...unfortunately. 

REBECCA	Ok, professor, we’re going now.

VAN LINDEN	Not before you delete all of those photos and videos you took from your phones...

VAN LINDEN	In general all that may be said about me is that I am someone who has always got the situation under control. See you tomorrow...punctuality, thank you!
