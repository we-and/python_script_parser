JAMIE	Oh, fuck. Whoo!

JAMIE 	Shit. I still can't believe he fucking fought back like that.

MATTY	Can't believe you shot him. Hope it was worth it.

JAMIE	Did you check? 

JAMIE	How much is it? Is it enough?

MATTY	Hold on a sec, damn it.

JAMIE	Well, it's gotta be more than we need. Has to be.

MATTY	Maybe about 20K Old Billy Boy's definitely snakin' from the top. 

JAMIE	I told you he had it coming.

MATTY 	Ah, all right. We gotta get to the border tonight. When they find that body in the morning, they're gonna come looking for us.

JAMIE	Straight to Mexico. 

MATTY 	Yeah. Straight to Mexico.

JAMIE	Think we'll have enough for that beach house?

MATTY	Keep dreaming.

JAMIE	Oh, come on. Something right on the sand.

MATTY	Okay, right on it.

JAMIE	I gotta learn to surf.

MATTY	You got a lot to learn, buddy. 

RICH	You're born, you go to school, get a job, get married,and you're supposed to do one thing after the other. And in the end, get what you want.

ALICE	I don't know what you want me to say, Rich.  Best laid plans and all that.

RICH	Well, thanks for getting me a job at the clinic.

ALICE	Oh, of course. You know, I know it's not big city hospital. It's not as exciting, but... it's enough to get you and Jan back on your feet. 

RICH 	Yeah. 

JAN	He threw away his entire career. Took one mistake and let 'em beat him with it.

RACHEL 	Jan...

JAN	All of that work for nothing. He didn't even fight it.

RACHEL	He meant well, even if he didn't show it right.

JAN	Yeah. I'm gonna start on Biology next week. I'm just waiting on the textbooks. I can't have Riley falling too far behind.

RACHEL	It's only things, stuff. You can buy new stuff. A new house.

JAN	Thank you for letting us stay here. Just a few more months.

RACHEL	Our home is your home.

ALICE	Man, you really need a lawyer for this stuff, Rich. 

RICH	Can't afford a lawyer. 

ALICE	What does Dad have to say about that?

RICH	He sees it as a personal insult.

RICH 	Thanks, sis.

ALICE	Oh.

ALICE	Thanks for the beer.

RICH 	Mm.

RICH	Hey, Pops. Listen, I just wanted to thank you for letting us stay at your place. And I wanted to let you know that I finished the last of the papers. So... 

FRANK	What do you want me to say, Rich? Congratulations? You fucked up.

RICH	You act like I had a choice. What was I supposed to do? Take it to court, drag it out for years? I couldn't put my family through that.

FRANK	Suppose I was one of your patients?

RICH	Oh, Dad, come on!

FRANK	Just suppose. Just stitch me up. There's a / chance that I'll pull through. But what do you tell me?

RICH	I'd tell you to fight.

FRANK	Yeah. Right.

RICH	But that is not always the answer, you know? Sometimes you gotta know when you've lost. I lost.

FRANK	Spoken like someone who is just used to being a loser.

RICH	It's funny how your version of winning always has you at the front and your family somewhere else. I won't do that to mine.

RACHEL	And now the piece de resistance.

RACHEL	Authentic vegetarian lasagna.

FRANK	I'm starving. Thank you.

RACHEL	I got the recipe off the Internet.

RICH	If it mattered to you so much, why didn't you say something?

JAN	I said we should have got a lawyer. 

RACHEL	Frank, it's okay.

RACHEL	Don't worry, Riley. Your granddaddy and I used to argue all the time. Didn't we, honey? These things pass.

FRANK	Come here. Have something to eat. 

JAN	Rich, I love you, but I need to know that you're still in this, that I am not doing this on my own.

RICH	Hey. Hey. You're not. You're not.

JAN	Because if I am, then maybe I should be on my own.

RICH 	Jan.

JAMIE	It's hot as balls out here.

MATTY	I wanna get to state line by midnight.

MATTY	Put some money on two, all right? Hey, what are you doing?

JAMIE	Hey, hey, hey, relax.

MATTY	Jesus Christ. Fucking money everywhere. Are you crazy? Relax.

JAMIE	It's not going anywhere.

MATTY 	Jesus.

MATTY	And don't forget my beer. God! Idiot.

WOMAN	Lookin' for something?

JAMIE	Just checking the merchandise.

CLERK	Everything okay with you, bud?

JAMIE	Yeah, bud.

CLERK	Hey, you one of the Granger boys?

JAMIE	Who's asking?

CLERK	Out back.

MATTY 	Oh, fuck. 

MATTY	Jamie!

JAMIE	Stay there! Stay there and flank the bastard. 

MATTY	What the hell are you doing?

JAMIE	I don't know. It was a spur of the moment kinda thing. I couldn't pass it up.

WOMAN	Please! I have a baby!

MATTY	Jamie, what about the cameras? 

JAMIE	Relax, they're not on.

CLERK	The cops are on the way!

JAMIE	Your dumb ass didn't get anywhere near that alarm!

MATTY	Throw down your gun and come out. We'll tape you and the girl up, and we'll go. We'll get out of here. You'll never see us again. I give you my word.

CLERK	No fucking way, scumbags!

MATTY 	Stay.

JAMIE	All right, no more fucking around, asshole. You come out now, or I'm gonna kill this bitch. You have five seconds!

MATTY 	Five...

WOMAN	I have a baby! Please! 

MATTY	Jamie, don't do this.

WOMAN	I won't tell anybody.

JAMIE 	Four!

WOMAN	Please, just let me go home.

JAMIE	Three!

WOMAN	Just let me go home, please.

JAMIE	Two! Come on, asshole.

CLERK	He's not gonna do it.

JAMIE	You want her kid growing up without a mom?

MATTY	Jamie, don't do this.

WOMAN 	Please.

JAMIE 	One.

MATTY 	Jamie.

CLERK	Sons of bitches! Mother fuckers! 

MATTY	Jesus Christ, Jamie! What'd you do?

JAMIE	I don't know. I just saw the register and the cash. I thought we could

MATTY	I meant the girl! Goddamn!

JAMIE	I didn't mean for it to get all fucked up. I just thought we could get the money.

MATTY	Just shut up! 

JAMIE	Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

MATTY	Come over here.

JAMIE	Oh, shit, I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

MATTY	Help me up.

JAMIE 	Oh, fuck.

MATTY	Okay, help me up.

JAMIE 	Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck, shit.

FRANK	You know, quail season's coming. You wanna go hunting?

RILEY	Um, hell yeah. I mean yes.

FRANK	Your dad was your age when I took him.

RICH	I remember.

RILEY	Can I go, Mom? Please?

RICH	The joys of having a former sheriff as your father.

JAN	I'm sure Frank will take good care of her.

FRANK	Well, I can't promise she's gonna shoot straight. Unless talent skips a generation.

RICH	Excuse me, I wasn't that bad. You know that.

FRANK	Learned from the best.

RICH	That's true.

RACHEL	Rich, it's the clinic. Alice says they need you now.

RICH	And duty calls. Eat your greens, Riley.

MATTY	I'm dying, Jamie. Fuckin' dying.

JAMIE	No, don't even say it. That bullet, it just It just hit your leg. It's, it's... 	

MATTY	Must've hit something important.

JAMIE	What do we do?

MATTY	We gotta get as far away as possible. We have until dawn until they find the store. Once that happens, they're gonna set up roadblocks, and we're fucked.

JAMIE	You really think they'd go to all that trouble?

MATTY	They're gonna be looking for us. They're gonna be looking for us hard after what you did.

JAMIE	You don't have to stay on it like that. I said I'm sorry.

MATTY	Oh, I need a doctor. Fuck.

JAMIE 	No. No. Those hospital bitches will report it.

MATTY	I got a plan.

JAMIE	I think that we should just keep going and

MATTY	Just keep driving. Just keep driving. 

ALICE	Thanks for coming in on such short notice.

RICH	Here to the rescue.

MATTY	Hey, hey, be careful.

JAMIE	Just hang on, bro. Two weeks from now, we'll be laughing about this.

RICH	Most intense thing I ever been through. God, there was so much bleeding. So much! And he... It's actually a miracle he didn't die the moment he hit the ground. We induced a coma and waited for the swelling to go down. We operated. Took like six hours. 

ALICE	But you saved his life.

RICH	Well, and he was one of the lucky ones.

ALICE	Look, Rich, I know you don't wanna hear this, but you can still make a difference here.

RICH 	Yeah. All right, I gotta get going.

MATTY	Is that him?

JAMIE	Yeah, that's him. 

JAMIE	Fucking brilliant, Matty! This is gonna work. I can feel it. That last line, I won't et another chance.

JAMIE	Just hang on, bro, you hear me?

MATTY	Yeah.

JAMIE	You just hang on. 

MATTY	I haven't seen a house for miles.

JAMIE	What'd you go and get Grizzly Adams for a doctor?

MATTY	This is perfect. Isolated, remote, no one else around. We got lucky. You did good. You did real good.

JAMIE	Yeah.

MATTY	Right there. He's turning. 

MATTY	Little longer, until he falls asleep.

FRANK	Did you ever wonder?

RACHEL 	About?

FRANK	How we did.

RACHEL	We did the best we could. We weren't perfect, but no one is.

FRANK	Well, tell that to your son.

RACHEL 	Sweetheart...

FRANK	Oh, baby, I could've done much better.

RACHEL	Rich does not need a lecture. He needs you to listen,  to be there.

FRANK	He knows I am.

RACHEL		It wouldn't hurt to tell him every now and then.

FRANK	I listen to him. Why do you always  have to be right?

RACHEL	What would you do without me?

FRANK	Oh, I can't even remember where my socks are without you. 

RACHEL 	Oh, please. 

FRANK 	Baby.

RACHEL	I love you.

FRANK	I can't live without you.

RICH 	Hey. 

JAN 	Yeah? 

RICH	I've been thinking about everything. We were talking about it. Look, we only have to stay here until the end of summer. And we'll put some money away. I'll open my own practice. And I'll fix this, I promise. You and Riley...mean the world to me.

MATTY 	It's time.

JAMIE	All right.

MATTY	We're gonna do this one clean. Just tie 'em up, that's it. You got it?

BACK	Hey. No killing.

JAMIE	Yeah, well, what if they run?

MATTY	Then you knock 'em down. You got it? Hey! Hey, I wanna hear you say it.

JAMIE 	No fucking killing. I got you, bro.

MATTY 	Oh, shit.

JAN	Was that...

RICH	Stay here.


JAMIE	Hey, hey, Matty! Matty, help! Matty! Help me, Matt! Matty, help! 

MATTY 	No. I'm-- I'm sorry. Did you have to shoot? What'd I fucking tell you? What'd I tell you? Come on! 

RICH 	Dad?

JAMIE	I swear it was an--

MATTY	You bastard.

MATTY	No, it was not a fucking accident.

JAMIE	She just fucking walked in the back, and I reacted. I didn't mean to.

MATTY	It's okay.

JAMIE	I swear. Please.

MATTY	Oh, shit, the doc.

RICH	Guys are breaking in.

JAN	What?

JAN	The line's dead. Riley.

RICH	Jan, Jan, stay Jan. 

JAN 	Riley. 

RILEY	Mom.

JAN	Baby, you gotta run, okay? Don't ask any questions. We just have to--

RILEY 	Mom! Mom.

JAMIE	Shh.

RICH	Get out of my house.	

MATTY	My brother already has your wife and kid. I won't hurt 'em. I give you my word. But you pull that trigger, there's no guarantee what my brother might do. 

MATTY	Good choice.

JAMIE	That's all of 'em. Phones have shit reception. But I grabbed these just in case.

MATTY	Do it. I don't wanna  take any chances.

MATTY	Bring me the doc.

JAN	No, leave him alone!

RILEY	Mom, are we gonna be okay? Where's Grandma?

JAN	It's gonna be okay.

RICH	Where's my mom?

MATTY	It was an accident.

RICH	No. No.

MATTY	We're not here to hurt anyone. And we're not gonna steal anything. 

RICH	Then why?

MATTY	I'm bleeding to death, and I need somebody to plug this leak, and you're a doctor.

RICH	Not that kind of a doctor.

MATTY	Meaning what?

RICH	I haven't seen the inside of a leg in  years. I can't help you.

JAMIE	You're a lying piece of shit. I heard you at the clinic. He was talking about stitches and swelling and surgery. You know what you're doing. 

RICH	I don't operate on legs. You're gonna have to find someone else.

MATTY	There's no time. Whatever you were before, tonight you're a leg surgeon, Doc.

RICH	I'll need equipment.

JAMIE	Like what? A knife?

RICH	A scalpel. I'm gonna need clamps, a suturing kit.

MATTY	Where can we get 'em?

RICH	Back at the clinic.

JAMIE	What the fuck did you just say? We're not going back there.

RICH	It's the only way.

MATTY 	Jamie.

JAMIE	Yeah, Matty.

MATTY	Bring me his wife.

RICH	Wait! There might be a box of tools in a box. Uh, just old college tools in one of the barns. Let me go check.

MATTY	I don't know if you're lying or not, and I don't really care, but if you're playingsome kinda trick, and I die, you're gonna be stuck on this farm with my brother, and he already killed Grandma. What do you think he's gonna do to the rest of you?

RICH	And you brought him here.

MATTY 	Jamie...get him out of here.

MATTY	You don't have to be afraid. I'm not gonna hurt you. It was all a mistake before.

FRANK	Mistake?

MATTY	I never wanted to hurt anyone. Without your son, I'm gonna die.

FRANK	I've been with scum like you my whole life. You're all the same.

MATTY 	No. You got us all wrong. Trust me.

RICH	It's in one of those. 

JAMIE	We get what we came for, and we're gone.

MATTY	We used to live in a house like this. Ours isn't big though. It was just us and Dad. I could've left. Could've gone to college. But I stayed. I was always there for him.

JAMIE	You find it yet?

RICH	Give me a minute.

JAMIE 	Faster, Doc.

RICH	I killed a guy, you know.

JAMIE	What are you yapping about?

RICH	You asked me why I was on this farm. There was a car accident. Guy came in. I cut when I should've stitched or stitched when I should've cut. I don't even know. His family sued in civil court, and I lost everything.

JAMIE 	Yeah?

JAMIE	Just remember. You fuck up with my brother, and it's gonna cost you a lot more than a lawsuit. Now let's fucking go! 

MATTY	No. Just stop. 

MATTY 	Please don't.

FRANK 	Uh-huh. 

RICH	You know, I could've fought it. I probably would've won. The truth...is that they were right. I fucked up. I deserved to lose. No one understands. Wife doesn't understand, but I do. Now here I am, working at a clinic. Routine stuff nowadays, just basic. They don't even trust me with the kids. They don't trust me with anything. You really sure that you want me operating on your brother?

JAMIE 	No, I'm not. But I guess we're both fucking unlucky tonight. You done? Good fucking boy. Now let's go. Let's fucking go.

RICH	Ah, shit.

JAMIE	What the fuck? 

MATTY	He didn't mean it. He'll be good. Then we just get out of here. Everything will be okay. We just need to get to the border. There's this-- Let's get to the border.

JAMIE 	Get up! Grab the shit! 

FRANK 	Uh-huh.

JAMIE 	Fuck. 

JAN	I think someone's coming. 

JAMIE	Uh, Matty?

RILEY 	Dad.

RICH	Jan, Riley, Dad, you okay?

JAMIE 	Hey.

JAMIE	How you doing? It's gonna be all right. We got the stuff.

FRANK 	Don't do anything else they say. You understand?

RICH 	Okay. I'm gonna get us out of this, okay?

FRANK	Listen, we have to take control. I've seen how these things end. 

JAMIE	No, you don't worry about them. Just get better. I'll take care of it.

MATTY	No killing. No killing.

JAMIE	You just rest easy, bro.

JAMIE	You're operating, Doc. Now! 

RICH	I'll get us out of this. 

RICH	Now, I'm gonna need some help. Would you grab my wife?

JAMIE	Not a chance.


RICH	When I start cutting  into your brother, you're gonna have to hold him down as hard as you can. So as I said, my wife.

JAMIE	You're a doctor, right? You swore an oath? You have to help my brother. If he dies... that's against your oath, right?

JAMIE 	Fine. Your wife.

JAMIE 	You fuck!

JAMIE	Looks like you're up, old man.

JAMIE 	Oh.

JAMIE	You're a tough son of a bitch, huh? Used to be the big dog in town. Yeah. Bet you got a hard-on for me after I killed your wife.

JAMIE	Sure you'd like to dance with me if gave you the chance.

FRANK	Just give me five minutes alone. Take your fucking head off.

JAMIE 	Oh! Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, that's what I fucking thought. I'm gonna untie you now, and you better fucking behave, you hear me? Better fucking behave.

JAMIE	Just walk. No fucking...

JAMIE	Listen, I don't need fucking cuffs for you. Don't try anything.

RICH	Take it easy.

JAMIE	If my brother dies, I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill your daughter, I'm gonna kill your wife, and I'm gonna kill your fucking dad.

RICH 	All right. When I start cutting, bite on this.  need you to hold him down as best as you can.

RICH 	Got it?

JAMIE 	Yeah.

RICH	Okay. Dad, grab his ankles.

RICH	On three.

JAMIE	All right.

RICH 	One. Two.	

JAMIE	Hey, hey, hey! Hey, you're fucking killing him! Hey!
