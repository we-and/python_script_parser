MANCUSO	Professor Boheme is late. They wait for him, still and in absolute silence (all immobile, Mancuso exits, hullabaloo)

AINA	Hey, spring my beauty..

VICTOR	Fasten your seat belts..ready for takeoff...go

BOHEME	Hey guys! The airplane is late, but I haven’t forgotten you. In addition to being your professor, I am an esteemed costume-maker for the Paris Opera. An extraordinary undertaking, that hasn’t distracted me for a second from my love of teaching... 

CRYSTAL	Mmm Boheme? Yes, good, bye, I have to go...

CRYSTAL	Hello professor, how was Paris? You didn’t forget about us, your students? Wait, I’ll help you...a fur? Are these the costumes for the Opera? Can I see? I have always dreamed of dressing like a diva

BOHEME	uh..

BOHEME	Shhh, ok follow me...Yes, you discovered me. I’m in trouble. Have you ever had dealings with a diva? You don’t know how it is! The first actress is impossible “I look fat, I look thin, more fur, less sequins!” If they don’t send the dress to Paris by tomorrow... I’m ruined! 

CRYSTAL	So I have to stay quiet? Mmm... Everything has a price...

BOHEME	Let’s do the following: you’ll put on the diva’s costume and all of your classmates will love you... 

CRYSTAL	Hurray!!

BOHEME	Shh but you have to help me

BOHEME	I put a lot of work into repairing the materials for this theatre costume lesson, but luckily Crystal has helped me and offered to model:  Here is the protagonist of the musical planet of the apes...

BOHEME	Let’s add the finishing touches to the diva’s costume

CLASS	(Laughter)

CRYSTAL	Hmph! This is how I learn to mind my own business

VICTOR	(Laugh)

CRYSTAL	(Growl)

BOHEME 	I love my students more than anything else...please, never change! Bye from Boheme and from the High school of Fashion!
