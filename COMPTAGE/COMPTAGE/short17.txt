THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching..? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Thomas has come to the docks to collect a big crate with red ribbon around it... It should be easy to find, but no matter how hard Thomas looks he still can't see it.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Luckily Salty is here to help... And I think he might have found Thomas' crate.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	What color was the ribbon on the crate that Thomas was looking for? Was it red? Was it blue? Or was it green?

THE EARL OF SODOR	The ribbon was red.

THE EARL OF SODOR	That's right, Salty. That's the crate Thomas is looking for. Now Thomas can be on his way through the snow!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray! That was fun. Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	There are many different ways to travel on the roads around Sodor. Bertie the bus carries passengers. Mr. Percival is very fond of riding his bright, shiny bicycle.

THE EARL OF SODOR	...And  Sir Topham Hatt prefers travelling in his car...

THE EARL OF SODOR	What did Mr. Percival travel on? Was it a car? Was it a bicycle? Or was it a helicopter? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Mr. Percival travelled by bicycle!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Now someone else has decided to try cycling...

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh dear! Maybe Sir Topham Hatt ought to stick with his car. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh, jolly well done for playing! I look forward to seeing you again next time. Goodbye!
