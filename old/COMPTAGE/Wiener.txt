DANNY	Yes! Wake up, girl. We’re going to the races!

JUDGE BROWN	Ladies and Gentlemen! 

JUDGE BROWN	The race you have all been waiting for!

PHIL	Alright, kiddo. What is it you want for your birthday?

DANNY	I was thinkin’ a dog.

PHIL	Dog?

DANNY	I wanna enter my dog in the race.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	How much would you take for that dog?

DANNY	She’s not for sale.

DANNY	She made it into regionals.

PHIL	Indiana? We can’t afford to go to a dog race in Indiana!

DANNY	I think Shelly hurt her leg.

BRIDGET	Please help her.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Fast little friend is a bit of a pushover.

SKIP	I don’t trust this Ms. Merryweather woman.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	I don’t race for the money, I race for the dignity.

SKIP	And you got his name because he had a birthmark.

BRIDGET	Just like the one Shelly has!

ANNOUNCER	May the best Wiener win and the rest roast!

PHIL	Hey, Shelly.

PHIL	What do you think? 

PHIL	Really wish I knew what you were thinking.  

PHIL 	Good morning.

DANNY	Ready for the big day?

PHIL	Well, as ready as I’ll ever be. 

PHIL	Hey, I’m really sorry that we had to cancel going to the Internationals, bud. 

PHIL	I know how much that meant to you.

DANNY	I know how much this means to you.

PHIL	Yeah, well we’re starting a family. 

PHIL	Sort of a race in itself, right?

DANNY	That’s a race?

PHIL	Well, more like a marathon.

DANNY	You know,

DANNY	I’m sad about missing the Internationals, but I’m happy that you’re happy.

PHIL	Well, I’ll be happy if she says yes.

DANNY	She will.

PHIL	Alright, well, go get your brother and sister up. I gotta get goin’.

PHIL	You kids be good while I’m gone.

DANNY	We will.

PHIL	No fighting.

BRIDGET	We’ll play nice.

PHIL	And get to bed on time.

SKIP	I’ll get them to 

SKIP	bed.

PHIL 	Yeah (chuckles), that goes for you too.

SKIP 	Mm-hm.

PHIL	You guys sure you’re okay with 

PHIL	this? 

PHIL 	Bringing Melanie officially into the family?

BRIDGET	She became a part of this family the second she stood up 

BRIDGET	for Shelly.

PHIL	Alright, cool. Alright, well as soon as she gets moved in and this feels real, then I’m sure everything will be fine. 

PHIL 	No, it’ll be better than fine. It’ll be awesome!

SKIP	(chuckles)

PHIL	Am I over doing it?

SKIP	Yes.

SKIP 	Go. Before she changes her mind.

PHIL	Alright.

PHIL 	This will be simple. Go to Paris. Propose. She says 

PHIL 	yes. We come back here 

PHIL 	and she lives 

PHIL	with us. 

PHIL 	Forever.

BRIDGET	Nervous?

PHIL	No. 

PHIL 	Yes.

DANNY	It’s okay, Dad. 

DANNY 	You’ve got us to get you through it.

PHIL	Alright, well I love you guys.

BRIDGET	Love you too.

PHIL	Aunt Jen is gonna be here tomorrow and she’s gonna cook for you guys for a couple of days and take care of you, alright? 

PHIL 	Be good for her.

DANNY	Relax. We’ve got it.

PHIL 	I mean it, please.

DANNY	We will.

BRIDGET	Bye!

DANNY	Bye!

BRIDGET	Good luck!

SKIP	See ya!

DANNY	Well,

DANNY 	Dad has officially left us 

DANNY	alone to fend for ourselves.

SKIP	Hm.

BRIDGET	I know. 

BRIDGET 	Isn’t it great?

SKIP	Hey, love will make you do crazy things.

DANNY	I still can’t believe he’s going to propose the same week as the 

DANNY 	Internationals.

BRIDGET	It’s the only 

BRIDGET 	week he could take off. You know that.

SKIP	Well, um… since I’m in charge now, there’s gonna be no more talking about wiener dog races, okay?

DANNY	That’s like 

DANNY 	all I have to talk about.

SKIP	Alright, well… go clean your room!

DANNY	What?

SKIP	Relax (chuckles), I’m just kidding. 

SKIP 	Go clean my room.

BRIDGET	Ha, ha.

DANNY	(to Shelly) Here girl, have some Canine Caviar. You’re so lucky your food’s already made.

DANNY 	I know it’s good, 

DANNY 	but it’ll still be there when you get back.

REPORTER	Danny Jack?

DANNY	Um, yes.

REPORTER	Is it true Shelly will not 

REPORTER	be racing in this year’s Internationals? 

REPORTER 	Come on kid, just gimme a sound bite.

DANNY	(sighs) 

DANNY 	It’s true. 

DANNY 	It’s not what I wanted. 

DANNY 	It’s not what we wanted. 

DANNY 	But it’s bigger than just us. 

DANNY 	This has 

DANNY 	to do with our whole family. 

DANNY 	I can’t say what our Dad’s doing 

DANNY 	right now because it’s a surprise, 

DANNY 	but we’re happy for him.

DANNY 	We’re also really sad 

DANNY 	to be

REPORTER	Quitting.

REPORTER 	Is something wrong with Shelly? 

REPORTER 	Has Shelly not been working out? 

REPORTER 	Tell me, really. Is something wrong with the dog?

SKIP	Hey, what do you think you’re 

SKIP 	doing?

REPORTER	Are you Skip?

SKIP	You can’t just walk

SKIP 	on our property and roll 

SKIP	cameras. 

SKIP 	Get outta here! (to Danny and Bridget) Come on.

BRIDGET	But I wanna be a 

BRIDGET 	movie star!

SKIP	(to Reporter) Good-bye. 

REPORTER	(rushing) Will Shelly 

REPORTER	be racing next year?  

REPORTER 	(sighs) 

DANNY	Who’s on our lawn?

BRIDGET	It’s

BRIDGET 	just the neighbor girl. 

BRIDGET 	She is so weird.

SKIP	(to Bridget) Here you go. (to Danny) Here 

SKIP	you go.

BRIDGET	Wow. You cooked this?

DANNY	I thought you didn’t know how to cook.

SKIP	Relax. Dad made it before he left.

BRIDGET	Oh.

DANNY	I thought so.

DANNY 	Your cooking

DANNY 	usually comes out of a box.

BRIDGET	And includes the directions 

BRIDGET 	“just add water”.

DANNY	(to Shelly) Ya better eat up too, girl. 

DANNY 	Can we take Shelly on a walk after dinner?

BRIDGET	Ooh, do you 

BRIDGET 	think we’ll see any more reporters? How’s my hair?

DANNY	I don’t know, how’s mine? 

DANNY 	Hey-ah!

SKIP	You two

SKIP 	can go on a walk but no more talking about 

SKIP	wiener dog races, okay?

BRIDGET	Okay.

DANNY	(to Shelly) You’re lucky you can’t 

DANNY	talk. Skip 

DANNY 	is so mean.

SKIP	Okay, the only

SKIP 	one that should be giving me puppy dog eyes

SKIP	is Shelly. 

SKIP	‘Cause 

SKIP 	she is a puppy dog. 

SKIP 	I don’t need a guilt trip from either one 

SKIP	of you. Okay? Now eat.

DANNY 	What if we go to the Internationals? 

DANNY 	You know, just for a little bit.

BRIDGET	Danny! Just for a little bit? The races are like thousands of miles away.

DANNY	Yeah, but

BRIDGET	Never, ever thought I’d be saying this, but I’m with Skip on this one. No more talking about wiener dog races. 

BRIDGET	I mean, at least for today.

BRIDGET 	Unless we see more reporters, of course. Really, how is my hair?

JUDGE BROWN	There you are!

JUDGE BROWN 	I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

DANNY	Judge Brown.

JUDGE BROWN	What have you done?

DANNY	What’s going on?

JUDGE BROWN	You have withdrawn 

JUDGE BROWN	from the race. 

JUDGE BROWN 	You’re not going to the Wiener 

JUDGE BROWN	Dog Internationals?

DANNY	We can’t go.

DANNY 	Our Dad’s on his way to propose 

DANNY 	to Melanie.

JUDGE BROWN	Ugh, those two and their blatant disregard for the rules! 

JUDGE BROWN  	Oh this is bad. 

JUDGE BROWN	This is very, 

JUDGE BROWN 	very bad.

BRIDGET	Wait, 

BRIDGET 	...are you upset because you won’t have a U.S. racer?

JUDGE BROWN	Well, it’s not we won’t have a racer, 

JUDGE BROWN 	it’s who we will have if you two don’t race.

DANNY	Can’t Handshake 

DANNY 	go in our place? Or one of the other dogs that 

DANNY 	placed in the Nationals?

JUDGE BROWN	Does anyone read the rules, except me? 

JUDGE BROWN	No! That’s 

JUDGE BROWN 	not how it works! 

JUDGE BROWN	Just as the Nationals have a rulebook, right? 

JUDGE BROWN 	Now, so do the Internationals. But the International rulebook is much bigger and thicker and longer and harder and much more cumbersome for me to understand. And mainly because it’s composed of thirty-seven different languages, and I don’t speak Swahili that well.

DANNY	So, who will go in our place then?

JUDGE BROWN	Mrs. Merryweather.

BRIDGET	She was disqualified!

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, for the Nationals, yes. 

JUDGE BROWN	But this is the Wiener 

JUDGE BROWN 	Dog Internationals. They are two separate organizations.

DANNY	So, what’s the difference?

JUDGE BROWN	One ends in an “N” the other ends in an “I”.

BRIDGET	But isn’t a race a race?

JUDGE BROWN	(sighs) Little Bo Bridget, you obviously have

JUDGE BROWN 	never been to the Internationals.

JUDGE BROWN 	It’s not just a race. No, it’s the motherlode grand dame of all

JUDGE BROWN 	races.

JUDGE BROWN 	I must speak to your father. Here,

JUDGE BROWN 	have

JUDGE BROWN 	him call me.

JUDGE BROWN 	We

JUDGE BROWN 	need to make sure that you stay in the race.

JUDGE BROWN 	Now, I leave tomorrow.

JUDGE BROWN 	Perhaps,

JUDGE BROWN 	you could ride with me if you like.

JUDGE BROWN 	(to Shelly) I can’t even look at you, Shelly. I’m just too upset. Okay, well if you insist. One, just one little

JUDGE BROWN 	itty-bitty,

JUDGE BROWN 	teeny-weeny little pet. (speaks in baby-talk) That’s a go

JUDGE BROWN 	Awe. That’s a good girl. 

JUDGE BROWN 	That’s such a good puppy. That’s a good, good, good girl. Yes, it is.

DANNY	Judge Brown?

JUDGE BROWN	Well we must speak to your father. Rule twelve point twenty-three clearly states that if you are not

JUDGE BROWN 	in the stands at the time your race is announced,

JUDGE BROWN 	Mrs. Merryweather will race in your place. 

JUDGE BROWN 	Now, 

JUDGE BROWN 	you can sign this form withdrawing from the race 

JUDGE BROWN 	and I will contact Ms. Merryweather. 

JUDGE BROWN	Or

JUDGE BROWN 	you can convince your father 

JUDGE BROWN 	to let you partake in the Wiener Dog 

JUDGE BROWN 	Internationals. 

JUDGE BROWN	The choice is yours. Choose 

JUDGE BROWN 	wisely.

DANNY	So, 

DANNY 	if we sign this… 

DANNY 	...can we go next year?

JUDGE BROWN 	Yes, of course. But 

JUDGE BROWN 	only as a mere spectator. 

JUDGE BROWN 	Good day.

BRIDGET	So, this may really be our only chance to go to this thing.

SKIP	Keepin’ her warm for next year?

DANNY	Yeah, 

DANNY 	I guess.

SKIP	You know, I thought you two would be having more fun giving me a hard time, 

SKIP 	making my life all difficult and all.

DANNY	Is that what you expected?

SKIP	If I were you, I’d be giving me a hard time.

BRIDGET	I can be more difficult on you, if you’d like.

SKIP	I didn’t mean for it to

SKIP 	sound like I was asking for it. 

DANNY	Can I show you something?

SKIP	Sure.

BRIDGET	Come on!

DANNY	Yes!

BRIDGET	Oh! Oh, you’re so good.

DANNY	Distance divided by time equals speed. Shelly went twenty-two miles per hour!

SKIP	Wow.

SKIP	You’re way too into math. 

SKIP 	Well, I’m gonna go spend the rest of my time inside.

DANNY	Wait, 

DANNY	Skip!

SKIP	What?

DANNY	What if…

SKIP	What?

DANNY	What

DANNY 	if we were to go to the 

DANNY	Internationals? Dad wouldn’t find out, 

DANNY 	and we’d be back before he even 

DANNY 	knew it.

SKIP	Not a chance. 

SKIP	No puppy dog eyes! 

BRIDGET	Well, there’s always next year.

DANNY	Yeah, I guess so.

BRIDGET	Whatcha doin’?

DANNY	Trying to cheer myself up.

BRIDGET	Well, 

BRIDGET	come on. Let’s watch some TV to get your 

BRIDGET 	mind off things.

SKIP	Yes, please. I don’t know what to do

SKIP 	with “Sad Danny”.

NEWSCASTER	The Wiener Dog Internationals is only days 

NEWSCASTER	away, and we’re told the 

NEWSCASTER	U.S. is 

NEWSCASTER	unsure of who will be 

NEWSCASTER	sent to represent America.

SKIP	Oh, that’s not helping him get his mind off the race.

BRIDGET	Shh!

NEWSCASTER	On one hand 

NEWSCASTER	you have current champion 

NEWSCASTER	Shelly Jack. On the other, two-time champion, Princess.

DANNY	Boo!

NEWSCASTER	Some 

NEWSCASTER	think Princess 

NEWSCASTER	is the stronger racer. 

NEWSCASTER	It 

NEWSCASTER	may almost be better for the U.S. if the 

NEWSCASTER	Jack family 

NEWSCASTER	lets this one go.

BRIDGET	Hey!

NEWSCASTER	However, after Ms. 

NEWSCASTER	Merryweather was ejected from the Nationals for unsportsmanlike conduct, 

NEWSCASTER	it’s of this reporter’s opinion 

NEWSCASTER	that the U.S. is rooting for an 

NEWSCASTER	honest champion, and that’s 

NEWSCASTER	Shelly Jack.

DANNY	That’s right!

NEWSCASTER	Of course,

NEWSCASTER	everyone’s favorite to win is Russia. 

NEWSCASTER	Hailing from the small town of Birsk, the Iron Hammer is thought to be a 

NEWSCASTER	clear contender for the title.

DARYA	The Hammer will crush the 

DARYA	competition. The Hammer will pound you to the ground. 

DARYA	The Hammer will win!

BRIDGET	Ooh, she’s scary.

SKIP	Yeah, well that puts an end to that. Time for 

SKIP	bed.

BRIDGET	C’mon Shelly!

SKIP	This parenting thing’s not that hard. I don’t know what Dad’s complaining about. Kids...

BRIDGET	How are you feeling?

DANNY	I’m happy that Dad’s moved on. 

DANNY	I am. 

DANNY 	But I really wanted this race. 

DANNY 	Shelly’s good, you know? She’s 

DANNY	really good.

BRIDGET	Mom would have been proud that you made it 

BRIDGET 	this far.

DANNY	You think so?

BRIDGET	Of course.

BRIDGET 	Nobody thought we were gonna win anything when we 

BRIDGET 	adopted Shelly.

DANNY	I don’t know. 

DANNY 	This whole thing is silly, 

DANNY 	I know, but somehow it’s the only place I feel so alive. 

DANNY 	It’s so… 

DANNY 	big, you know?

SKIP	Hey, 

SKIP	I thought I told you guys to get 

SKIP 	ready for bed. 

SKIP	No puppy 

SKIP	dog eyes! 

SKIP 	Alright, I’ve had enough of this. Living room, five minutes!

DANNY	Living room? 

DANNY 	Five minutes?

BRIDGET	Oh, no! He’s calling a meeting!

DANNY	He thinks he’s 

DANNY	Dad.

SKIP	Take a seat. 

SKIP	So I was 

SKIP 	thinking and

BRIDGET	You’re gonna let us go to the 

BRIDGET	race?

DANNY	Let Skip 

DANNY 	speak.

SKIP	So I know

SKIP 	I’m not the first to admit that the Nationals changed our lives 

SKIP 	for the better, 

SKIP 	but it did. 

SKIP	And you’ll never get me to repeat that to 

SKIP 	anybody else.

DANNY	That’s okay. I recorded it.

SKIP	Hey! Gimme that! 

SKIP 	So, 

SKIP	the way I was thinking it, 

SKIP 	the Internationals might be good for us too.

DANNY	We can’t let Ms. Merryweather race. 

DANNY 	Don’t forget about her!

BRIDGET	Mean, Ms. Merryweather.

SKIP	What if you two went with Judge Brown to compete?

SKIP	I mean,

SKIP 	he’s a responsible adult.

DANNY	He is a standup guy.

SKIP	Probably a lot more responsible than me.

BRIDGET	The best.

SKIP	So, if you do go race 

SKIP 	and you come straight 

SKIP	back, 

SKIP 	Dad may not be the wiser.

DANNY	So… yes?

SKIP	Yeah. Why not?

DANNY	Yes!

BRIDGET	Can we get up and scream now?

SKIP	Sure.

DANNY	We’re really going to the

DANNY 	Internationals?

BRIDGET	Wait, 

BRIDGET 	how are we gonna convince Judge Brown that Dad said yes?

SKIP	Leave that to me. Go pack your bags.

BRIDGET	Come on!

DANNY	(laughs) Come on!

DANNY	Shelly! We’re 

DANNY 	going to the Internationals!

BRIDGET	Come on, Shelly! (singing) the Internationals!

BRIDGET	The Internationals! 

BRIDGET	The Internationals!

BRIDGET 	Yay!

SKIP	Alright. 

SKIP 	Take care you two!

BRIDGET	Hey!

BRIDGET 	I didn’t get a hug. Get back here!

SKIP	Alright.

SKIP 	Come on.

DANNY	Uh-uh.

BRIDGET	Oh.

DANNY	Um, I 

DANNY	cannot believe I’m letting you do this.

BRIDGET	Ooh.

SKIP	You happy now?

BRIDGET	Yeah.

SKIP	No puppy dog

SKIP	eyes! I told you guys! 

SKIP	Good-byes are 

SKIP 	stupid anyways. Know what, you two stay together, 

SKIP 	...don’t talk to strangers…

BRIDGET	Look both ways before crossing the road. We got it.

SKIP	And take care of yourselves, okay?

BRIDGET	We will.

DANNY	Thank you for doing this.

DANNY 	You’re a pretty-okay older brother after all.

SKIP	Pretty okay? 

SKIP	Okay, whatever. Get outta 

SKIP 	here before I change my mind.

BRIDGET	Oh, and it shouldn’t take us more than twenty minutes to get to his house. So set an alarm.

SKIP	Are you afraid I’m gonna forget or something?

BRIDGET	Yeah.

SKIP	What do you think I am?

DANNY	Our older brother.

SKIP	Get outta here.

BRIDGET	Bye, Skip.

DANNY	Bye. See ya!

BRIDGET	Miss you already.

SKIP	This is probably my worst idea ever.

SKIP 	Oh… 

SKIP	Go time!  Hello?

JENNY	 Skip-a-doodle-do!

SKIP	Hey, Aunt Jenny! What’s up?

JENNY	I’m just at the store getting a few things, and then I’ll be heading over to see everybody real soon.

SKIP	Oh! I thought you weren’t coming until tonight.

JENNY	Well, you’re in luck. I’m early. I know. (laughs)

SKIP	Okay, Aunt Jenny. 

SKIP 	Talked to Dad and he said you don’t need to come by anymore.

JENNY	Really? Well, I, I, I just got some food and I’m here. 

JENNY 	So I Well, ma- maybe I’ll ju- I’ll just come by for dinner and then I’ll head 

JENNY	out. How’s that?

SKIP	Um, yeah. Sounds great.

JENNY	Well, put one of those buckets of sunshine on the phone.

SKIP	Danny and Bridget are outside playing Cops and Robbers so… um… they have tape over their mouths?

JENNY	They both have tape over their mouths?

SKIP	I never said they were good at it.

JENNY	Well, uh, Skip. I’m not gonna ask you again. Put the kids on the phone.

SKIP	Danny! Bridget! Aunt Jenny 

SKIP 	wants to talk to you! (sighs)

DANNY	Coming! 

DANNY 	Hi, Aunt Jenny!

JENNY	Hi, little curly top. Is Skip 

JENNY	treating you okay?

DANNY	Skip’s been great! He’s doing a really good job taking care of us.

BRIDGET	Skip’s the 

BRIDGET	best older brother a little kid 

BRIDGET	could ask for. We’re so 

BRIDGET	super excited to be 

BRIDGET	spending all this time with him alone and bonding. 

BRIDGET	It’s nice with no adults in the home.

JENNY	But uh, are you two on separate lines? 

JENNY	How can you both hear me?

SKIP	Okay, have fun kids! 

SKIP	Ah. Kids.

SKIP 	They went back outside to play.

JENNY	Well, get ‘em lined up for when I arrive. I wanna collect me some hug sandwiches. (laughs)

SKIP	Um-hm. Sure. 

SKIP 	Definitely will do that.

JENNY	Bye! 

JENNY 	Awesome! Ah, so excited! Nom, nom, nom! (chuckles)

SKIP 	I need to come up with a new plan.  

SKIP 	Ooh, go time part two!

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, oh, good morning. 

JUDGE BROWN 	Is… 

JUDGE BROWN 	...that the withdrawal form? 

JUDGE BROWN 	(sighs) 

JUDGE BROWN 	I’m so sorry to see it end like this.

JUDGE BROWN 	I understand your father is

JUDGE BROWN 	proposing to Melanie 

JUDGE BROWN 	but this is a very important 

JUDGE BROWN 	event. 

JUDGE BROWN	Wait. Wait, this is not signed.

DANNY	Nope. We’re going to the 

DANNY	Internationals!

JUDGE BROWN	Yea 

JUDGE BROWN 	Oh, yippee! 

JUDGE BROWN 	Yeah!

BRIDGET	Yeah.

JUDGE BROWN	(clears throat) We must have your 

JUDGE BROWN 	father’s approval.

BRIDGET 	Uh,

BRIDGET	Judge Brown. You better get that.

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, yes. My pocket’s 

JUDGE BROWN 	ringing. 

JUDGE BROWN 	Hello?

SKIP	Judge Brown.

SKIP 	Do you know who this is?

JUDGE BROWN	Uh, no. actually I don’t.

SKIP	This is Phil Jack.

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, oh, of course. Yes, Phil Jack, how are you? I’m, I’m (whispering to kids) It’s your 

JUDGE BROWN 	father.

BRIDGET	Yeah.

SKIP	I heard that you are willing to take my 

SKIP	kids to the Internationals?

JUDGE BROWN	Yes, yes, I am.

SKIP	I’d very much 

SKIP	appreciate that. Uh, I heard Mrs. 

SKIP	Merryweather will be taking our place so…

SKIP 	 I feel it’s best if we right this wrong.

JUDGE BROWN	Yes, of course. I will take excellent 

JUDGE BROWN 	care of the children. 

JUDGE BROWN 	And 

JUDGE BROWN	little Shelly. And we will 

JUDGE BROWN 	see you at the race, I assume?

SKIP	 Uh, well of, of course!

SKIP 	Yeah, 

SKIP	of course. I’ll see you in a few days.

SKIP 	Good-bye.

JUDGE BROWN	Good-bye. (to kids) Well, 

JUDGE BROWN 	...it looks like 

JUDGE BROWN 	you three are 

JUDGE BROWN	going to the 

JUDGE BROWN	Internationals.

JUDGE BROWN 	We’ll take my car. To the 

JUDGE BROWN 	Wiener Mobile!

BRIDGET/DANNY	To the Wiener Mobile!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	We cannot let this happen, Princess. Those kids have gotta be stopped. Looks like you and I are taking a road trip. (to driver) Let’s go!

BRIDGET/DANNY/JUDGE BROWN	Ninety-nine hotdogs and buns on

BRIDGET/DANNY/JUDGE BROWN	the wall, Ninety-nine hotdogs and buns. 

BRIDGET/DANNY/JUDGE BROWN	You take one down, you pass it around, 

BRIDGET/DANNY/JUDGE BROWN	ninety-eight hotdogs and buns on the wall. Ninety-eight…

SKIP	Oh, 

SKIP 	...hey Aunt Jenny!

JENNY	Hey, Skip!

SKIP	That was

SKIP 	fast. Um, 

SKIP 	I was actually on my way out.

JENNY	Yeah,

JENNY 	the store was really close. 

JENNY 	You look great!

SKIP	Uh, you look… 

SKIP 	like it’s windy.

JENNY	(laughs) 

SKIP	Um, 

SKIP	your car’s smoking.

JENNY	Uh,

JENNY 	...it does that, but I’ll, I’ll move it 

JENNY 	later. 

JENNY 	Look at you! You’re so grown up! Ha-ha-ha ho-ho!

SKIP	Okay. 

JENNY 	Oh.

JENNY	I suppose you are too old for a 

SKIP 	Yeah.

JENNY 	hair ruffle and cheek pinch.

SKIP	A little bit.

JENNY	Are you gonna invite me in?

SKIP	Oh, like I said, I talked to Dad. Um, he knows everything’s good now. So, 

SKIP 	if you have anywhere else to be… I mean…

JENNY	Nonsense. No. 

JENNY 	Where are those 

JENNY 	two little munchkins? They’re not too old for a 

JENNY 	hair ruffle or a cheek pinch.

SKIP	Yeah, they’re at the park.

JENNY	But you said they were 

JENNY 	already 

JENNY 	playing in the backyard. But you’re supposed to be watching them at all times.

SKIP	Uh, yeah, uh, well,  it’s a very safe park?

JENNY	Sounded like a question.

SKIP	N no it’s not a question, it’s just…

SKIP 	it’s a very safe park, for sure.

JENNY	Huh. Okay, good.

SKIP 	Yeah.

JENNY 	Well, I tell you what… I have to run back to the store because I forgot a few things.

SKIP	Oh.

SKIP 	Oh, so you’re staying?

JENNY	Yeah. Just for dinner and
JENNY 	the smoke usually means I shouldn’t drive for a few hours.

SKIP	Yeah, I am pretty sure that’s not supposed to happen to a car.

JENNY	I know, um, but when I say I’m gonna run to the store, I mean I’m 
	
JENNY 	gonna literally run to the store, cause I 

JENNY 	can’t take the car 
JENNY 	so… 

JENNY 	Will see ya in a bit!

SKIP	Okay. 

SKIP 	She’s crazy.

BRIDGET/DANNY/JUDGE BROWN	Fifty-nine hotdogs and

BRIDGET/DANNY/JUDGE BROWN	buns on the wall,

BRIDGET/DANNY/JUDGE BROWN	fifty-nine hotdogs and buns.

JUDGE BROWN 	Oh.

DANNY 	With relish.

BRIDGET/DANNY/JUDGE BROWN	You take one down, you pass it around…

DANNY 	This is getting really boring…

BRIDGET/DANNY	Fifty-eight hot dogs and buns on the wall.

BRIDGET 	From the top!

ROBERT	Can I help you?

SKIP	Yeah, I need a uh…

SKIP 	I’m lookin’ for a wiener dog.

ROBERT	There’s one right down there.

SKIP	Yeah, that’s not a wiener dog. 

SKIP 	That’s a pig.

ROBERT	Alright, alright. Excuse 

ROBERT	me, okay, 

ROBERT 	but I’m in sales. 

ROBERT 	Right 

ROBERT	down there, if you want her, 

ROBERT	you bring her up here.

SKIP	Hey, Shelly number two. 

SKIP 	She’ll do.

ROBERT	Okay.

SKIP	Is that a…

ROBERT	Art?

ROBERT 	Yes, it is.

SKIP	Okay.

DANNY	Look! Wiener schnitzel!

BRIDGET	Okay, everybody! From the top! And a five, six, seven, eight! (singing) Go to the store and buy some more, ninety-nine hotdogs and buns on the wall!

DANNY	So, you’re saying this race is bigger than the Nationals?

JUDGE BROWN	Oh,

JUDGE BROWN	...yes. Very much so. But it can also be very 

JUDGE BROWN	intimidating. Eight 

JUDGE BROWN	races, with eight dogs 

JUDGE BROWN	in each, 

JUDGE BROWN	all competing for 

JUDGE BROWN	top dog. 

JUDGE BROWN	Wiener of the World!

DANNY	Wow.

DANNY	Sixty-four countries? That is a bit 

DANNY	intimidating.

JUDGE BROWN	Yes,

JUDGE BROWN	well for some. But not for Shelly. 

JUDGE BROWN	‘Cause she’s a 

JUDGE BROWN	natural, she is.

BRIDGET	I didn’t even 

BRIDGET	know there were that many countries.

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, there are quite a lot more than that, but some of them don’t have enough wiener 

JUDGE BROWN	dogs to compete. 

DANNY	So, who are we up against first?

JUDGE BROWN	Well, that will all be determined tomorrow when we arrive. It’s all done randomly. 

JUDGE BROWN	Let’s say a prayer 

JUDGE BROWN	you’re not stuck with mean Russia. That little mutt is favored to win.

BRIDGET	Hey! Watch what you say in front of Shelly!

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, oh. Sorry, Shelly! 

JUDGE BROWN	Delicious!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Hand me my vintage gold embossed, Teflon coated, chiffon buffed, hot pink, tire deflator, please. 

JENNY	I’m back! Are the kids 

JENNY	back yet?

SKIP	Ah, yeah. Um, 

SKIP	Danny’s upstairs. He’s not feeling well…

JENNY	Is this Shelly? 

SKIP	Uh-huh. Yeah. 

JENNY	Hi! 

SKIP	Yeah, that’s, uh, that’s 

SKIP	Shelly.

JENNY	You should’ve heard your Dad 

JENNY	talking about you guys winning the Nationals. 

JENNY	He was so proud.

SKIP	Yeah, well, he has a funny way of showing it.

JENNY	Well, it’s his way of showing it. (kissing sounds)

SKIP	Yeah, so just don’t touch her 

SKIP	birthmark, that whole side. She got hurt in the last race. 

SKIP	So…

JENNY	Oh, okay. Hi.

JENNY	That’s weird. (chuckles)

SKIP	No, no. That’s not weird. 

SKIP	I mean, she just doesn’t like 

SKIP	new people. So…

JENNY	Well, she’s hoppin’ around okay. Get the kids out here! Where are they?

SKIP	Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean Danny he’s uh, he’s upstairs, like I said. Um…

JENNY	And Bridget?

SKIP	Uh...

KITTY	Hello.

JENNY	Oh, wow. 

JENNY	Is that really you, Bridget?

SKIP	Of course that’s her! Yeah. (scoffs) 

SKIP	Course it is. (laughs)

JENNY	Uh, yeah just you look so grown up. 

JENNY	Come here! Give your Aunt a hug! 

JENNY	What’s

JENNY	(laughs) What’s that? You’re supposed to be the warm 

JENNY	one. (laughs) 

JENNY	(laughs) Remember our 

JENNY	secret handshake?

KITTY	Secret handshake?

JENNY	Yeah. 

JENNY	Huh,

JENNY	...no?

JENNY	Oh, 

JENNY	...well, well, it’s been a while. 

JENNY	(laughs) 

JENNY	You guys hungry? Let’s eat! Yeah?

SKIP	(to Kitty) So, you did good.

KITTY	I need to get home soon.

SKIP	Can you please just stay for dinner? I mean, she’ll be outta here in no time.

KITTY	That means I’m going to have to eat dinner twice?

SKIP	Well, you’ll deal.

DANNY	That was good.

JUDGE BROWN	Nothing beats a good wiener!

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, no! 

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, no, no. 

JUDGE BROWN	No, no, no, no, no! This,  

JUDGE BROWN	...this will not do!

BRIDGET	What is it?

JUDGE BROWN	Ha! Someone let the air out of our tire. Or we have a big hole. (to Danny) Huh, did we run over anything sharp on the way here?

DANNY	I didn’t hear anything.

BRIDGET	Me neither.

JUDGE BROWN	Uh, I hope this doesn’t make us late for the Internationals.

DANNY	Hey, look!

BRIDGET	Let me see. (sniffs) Looks like dog hair.

JUDGE BROWN	Hmm. (sniffs) Very suspicious. Proceed with caution!

JENNY	So, what’s been new with you, Bridget? 

JENNY 	Bridget! (chuckles)

KITTY	Oh, um, new with me, 

KITTY	Uh...

KITTY 	That’s a tough one,

KITTY	because

JENNY	Because?

KITTY	Because… there are so many new things about me.

JENNY	Oh, I bet. You are at a fun age. (chuckles)

KITTY	Not sure if fun’s the right word.

JENNY/KITTY 	(laughs) 

JENNY	You know, I’m gonna go check on Danny.

SKIP	No!

SKIP 	I mean, he’s sleeping. So…

JENNY	I, I, I just wanna peak. I’ll be quiet, don’t worry! (laughs) 

SKIP	Go stop her!

KITTY	You’re not paying me enough to get that 

KITTY 	involved.

SKIP	I like the real Bridget better.

JENNY	Hey, Danny. It’s me. Aunt Jenny. 

JENNY 	I just wanna look at you, okay?

SKIP	I took his temperature before you got back, so…

JENNY	Oh, how bad was it?

SKIP	Um, one-oh-eight?

JENNY	What?

SKIP	I mean, ninety-eight. Ninety-eight.

JENNY	Oh, that’s not that bad.

SKIP	No, I mean it

SKIP 	seems like the sleep’s helping. So…

JENNY	Yeah. He’s

JENNY 	so quiet. 

JENNY 	It’s, it’s like he’s not breathing.

SKIP	Yeah. 

SKIP 	He lost his voice.

JENNY	Really? Your Dad said he just spoke with him.

SKIP	Well, you know how colds are. They’re,

SKIP	uh, here one minute,

SKIP 	gone the next.	

JENNY	Well, at least he has his dog.

JENNY 	You can tell they’re close.

SKIP	Yeah, very close. 

SKIP 	Uh, we should probably leave him alone.

JENNY	Yeah.

JENNY	His hair is so

JENNY 	soft. What kind of shampoo does he use?

SKIP	(speaks quietly) Uh… doggie shampoo.

JENNY	Okay.

MECHANIC 	It seems to be holding the air just fine.

MECHANIC	My guess is somebody deflated your tires. 

MECHANIC	Coulda been some bored kids.

DANNY	Or it could be somebody with an agenda.

MECHANIC	That’s a little

MECHANIC	dramatic. Who would wanna stop a couple of kids on their way to a race?

JUDGE BROWN	I can think of someone.

DANNY	Me too.

BRIDGET	Me three.

DANNY 	Wow.

DANNY 	This place is nice.

JUDGE BROWN 	Now, kids.

JUDGE BROWN 	You are right upstairs.

JUDGE BROWN 	I am down the hall if you need anything. Now,

JUDGE BROWN 	do not charge anything to the room.

BRIDGET	We’ll be good.

DANNY	Yes.

DANNY 	What is it, girl?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Alright,

MS. MERRYWEATHER	kid. Alright.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Let’s just keep

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	this our little secret, okay?

BRIDGET	(screams)

BRIDGET	Judge Brown! It’s Ms. Merryweather!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Stop the rackets!

JUDGE BROWN	Mrs.

JUDGE BROWN 	Merryweather!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	This is not what it looks like.

JUDGE BROWN	Oh!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh.

JUDGE BROWN	It’s a 

JUDGE BROWN 	match.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Alright, fine.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	It’s exactly what it looks

MS. MERRYWEATHER	like.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	But can you blame me, honestly?

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	I mean, I should be the one at the Internationals.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Not you!

DANNY	We won the

DANNY 	Nationals fair and square! It’s not our fault that you cheated!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Cheating is

MS. MERRYWEATHER	such a harsh word. I’d prefer to think of it

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	as creating an advantage.

BRIDGET	And what do you call this?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh, I call this creating a very big advantage.

JUDGE BROWN	Oh Mrs. Merryweather.

JUDGE BROWN 	For three long years I stood by your side,

JUDGE BROWN	promoted you with this wonderful

JUDGE BROWN 	wide world of wiener dog racing.

JUDGE BROWN	But no more.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Yes. I can see whose

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	side you’re standing on

MS. MERRYWEATHER	now. Well,

MS. MERRYWEATHER	...fine.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	You caught me trying to damage your vehicle. Fair enough. Well

MS. MERRYWEATHER	played. However, the Internationals are a public event.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	And I assure you, I will be there with

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	more allies than enemies.

DANNY	You don’t scare us. We’ve got Shelly.

MS. MERRYWEATHER.	Yes.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	For now.

DANNY	What do you 

DANNY	mean?

SKIP	Hey, well, uh,

SKIP 	...thank you for coming, Aunt Jenny.

SKIP 	It was so

SKIP 	nice to see you.

JENNY	Yeah, you too! Sorry I had to be so quick. (speaks in silly voice) Quick like a bunny!

JENNY	(laughs) Gosh,

JENNY 	I do love bunnies.

KITTY	Yes, it was

KITTY 	really great meeting you…

KITTY 	I mean, meeting you here.

KITTY 	At the house.

JENNY	(laughs)

JENNY 	Well, hopefully I’ll be able to come out here again soon. I feel like I hardly recognize you two anymore. (laughs)

SKIP	Yeah.

KITTY	I know the feeling.

KITTY	Can I go home now?

SKIP	Yeah, sure.

KITTY	Your family is so weird.

SKIP	I know.

JENNY 	(sighs) 

JENNY	What?

JENNY 	Hey! What do you think you’re doing?

KITTY’S MOTHER	Excuse me?

JENNY	What’re you doing with Bridget?

KITTY’S MOTHER	Who’s Bridget?

SKIP	Hey, Aunt Jenny! 

SKIP	I see that you found Bridget. 

SKIP 	And the neighbor lady.

JENNY	This isn’t Bridget,

JENNY 	Skip. And I’m guessing Danny’s not sick,

JENNY	either.

JENNY 	What’s going on?
	
SKIP	Yeah. (sighs)

DANNY	(on tape recorder) Skip’s the

DANNY	(on tape recorder) best older brother a little kid could ask for.

JENNY	What did you do with the kids?

SKIP	Uh…

JENNY	Okay.

PHIL	I can’t believe he did that.

JENNY	I understand Phil.

JENNY 	Bye. (to Skip) Well, I just spoke to your dad. He’s furious

JENNY	about what you did.

JENNY	He was just hours away from proposing

JENNY 	and now he’s hopping on a plane to California instead.

SKIP	Danny and Bridget gave me

SKIP	puppy dog eyes.

SKIP 	I’m not good with puppy dog eyes.

JENNY	He said you need to take responsibility and clean up your mess. You’re gonna go meet him there.

SKIP	I’m going to California?

SKIP	How?

SKIP 	In a car that barely even starts?

JENNY	It’s good enough to get you to the airport. Okay, (stammers) now grab Shelly. You’re gonna be takin’ her with you.

SKIP	Ah…

JENNY	What?

JENNY 	What is it now?

SKIP	(high pitch voice) Nothin’. (normal voice) Yeah, yeah, n- nothin’.

SKIP 	Nothing at all. Nothing

SKIP 	at all. Come on, Shelly.

GROUP	Shelly!

DANNY	This is exciting.

BRIDGET	(sighs)

DANNY	So, where are we going now?

JUDGE BROWN	You 

JUDGE BROWN	smell that?

DANNY	I smell greasy food.

BRIDGET	Ew. And dirty laundry.

JUDGE BROWN	No, no, no, no, under that. The undercurrent. (inhales deeply) That is the smell of the race.

BRIDGET	Nope.

BRIDGET 	Still gettin’ dirty laundry.

DANNY	Me too. And dog.

JUDGE BROWN	Alright, let’s just get you checked into your 

JUDGE BROWN 	dorms, okay?

DANNY	We get our own rooms?

JUDGE BROWN	Well, sort of. Each racing team gets to bunk with another racing team. 

JUDGE BROWN 	So you get half of a room.

SUPER FAN	Is that the real Shelly?	

DANNY	Um, yes.

SUPER FAN	Victory, victory! That’s our cry. V-I-C-T-O-R-Y! 

SUPER FAN	Yay, Shelly! 

SUPER FAN	Can I pet her?

DANNY	Sure.

SUPER FAN	This is my dog Pretzel.

BRIDGET	Awe. This is gonna be fun.

DARYA	Watch it, termites. Or I will crush you. 

DARYA	I will crush you, 
DARYA	like something that crushes 

DARYA	with a crunch. 

DARYA	Excuse me.

JUDGE BROWN	That’s the Russian I was telling you about. Let’s hope she’s not your roommate.

BRIDGET	She’s even scarier than on TV.

DANNY	Definitely.

JUDGE BROWN	Well, soon

JUDGE BROWN 	we will have to part ways. As I step foot onto sacred ground, which is the racetrack, I will have to look out, not just for you, but for all the other racers equally.

JUDGE BROWN 	So, I guess now it is (inhales) time for a… hug.

BRIDGET	Thank you for bringing us here.

DANNY	You’re the best.

JUDGE BROWN	Okay, that’s enough. Alright, I will call your father and let him know that you’ve arrived safely.

DANNY	Um, that’s okay.

DANNY 	We’ll do it from the dorm room.

JUDGE BROWN	Okay. Well, suit yourselves. I will see you 

JUDGE BROWN 	and (to Shelly) you, at the race.

DANNY	This is gonna be fun! Come on!

DANNY	How’re we supposed to find out which room is ours?

ETSUKO	Did you two need some help?

DANNY	I think so. We’re pretty lost.

ETSUKO	You’re the Jack Family, correct?

DANNY	How do you know?

ETSUKO	Your race last year was very

ETSUKO	famous.

ETSUKO 	As far as wiener dog races go. It was all over Japan.

DANNY	You’re the Japanese Racer? Yoshi, 

DANNY 	right?

ETSUKO	I’m Etsuko. 

ETSUKO	My sister is Ayameko.

ETSUKO 	Our dog is Yoshi. 

ETSUKO	It’s more her thing than mine, 

ETSUKO 	but yes… we represent Japan.

DANNY	So, how do we find out where we’re staying?

ETSUKO	First time here? Well, there’s a very long line around the corner but lucky for you,

ETSUKO 	you don’t have to stand in it.

DANNY	Why not?

ETSUKO	Cause you’re bunking with

ETSUKO 	us!

BRIDGET	I like you!

ETSUKO	I like you

ETSUKO 	too!

ETSUKO 	I know we may be enemies if we both make it

ETSUKO	into the final race,

ETSUKO 	but until then you’ll want to stick with us. These races can be brutal. Hm.

BRIDGET	Hm.

DANNY	Hm.

ETSUKO	Look who I found wandering the halls.

AYAMEKO	Shelly, Jack and the kids.

DANNY	I’m Danny.

BRIDGET	And I’m Bridget.

AYAMEKO	Yes, yes, of course I know

AYAMEKO	who you are. And

AYAMEKO 	this is Shelly.

AYAMEKO	My goodness. She’s standing

AYAMEKO 	right there in front

AYAMEKO	of me. I am so

AYAMEKO 	excited, I could just squeeze 

AYAMEKO 	her.

AYAMEKO 	I won’t really squeeze her. I was just stepping forward to take a look at her birthmark.

AYAMEKO 	The famous lightning

AYAMEKO	bolt.

AYAMEKO	Ah, yes.

AYAMEKO 	The mark

AYAMEKO 	of a champion. You should take a look at Yoshi.

DANNY	Is that…

AYAMEKO	It’s a

AYAMEKO	bird. Birthmark of agility,

AYAMEKO 	grace and high aspirations.

DANNY	Never seen another dog with a birthmark

DANNY	in the exact same

DANNY 	spot as Shelly’s.

AYAMEKO	Oh, keep your eyes peeled here.

AYAMEKO 	There are several. Seems to be a universal mark of a winner.

BRIDGET	It’s kinda weird that there’d be so many.

AYAMEKO	Don’t worry

AYAMEKO 	your pretty little head about it.

DANNY	Come on, Bridge.

AYAMEKO	You can leave Shelly here with me if you’d like.

DANNY	No,

DANNY 	that’s okay. I want her to see where she’s racing tomorrow.

AYAMEKO	Visualize

AYAMEKO 	the win? Is that your tactic?

DANNY	Um, no. We don’t

DANNY 	visualize anything.

DANNY 	Win or lose,

DANNY 	we do it together.

AYAMEKO	That’s very Zen.

BRIDGET	What does Zen mean?

DANNY	I don’t know. 

DANNY 	It’s a Japanese word. I think it means like, like you know um,

DANNY	humble or something. I really don’t 

DANNY 	know.

ETSUKO	Is that

ETSUKO	Ms. Merryweather?

AYAMEKO	Give me a second.

AYAMEKO 	She wants us to dognap Shelly.

ETSUKO	I don’t know about that.

AYAMEKO	That wasn’t a question.

AYAMEKO	If Mrs. M. says jump,	

AYAMEKO 	you jump.

DANNY	She was kinda weird.

BRIDGET	Yeah. The other one seems nice though.

DANNY	I wonder how Skip’s doing with Aunt Jenny.

BRIDGET	I’m sure he’s got it under control.

DANNY	Wow.

BRIDGET	I thought it was gonna be bigger than last time.

DANNY	It is bigger. It’s televised 

DANNY	all over the world.

BRIDGET	Come on!

DANNY	We’ll be starting about here.

BRIDGET	And ending

BRIDGET 	over there.

DANNY	Wanna give it a try?

BRIDGET	I think that’s a yes. (chuckles)

BRIDGET 	Okay!

DANNY	Ready?

BRIDGET	Come on.

BRIDGET	Come on!

DANNY	Go!

BRIDGET 	Yes!

DANNY 	Yes!

PHIL	Go get them and bring ‘em back to the car. You’re not racing. Not after what you did.

SKIP	Dad, I’m so, so

PHIL	Not now. Go.

SKIP	Okay, I’ll go find them.

BRIDGET 	Hopefully this time around she gets a fair race.

DANNY	There’s no Merryweather, at least.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Well, that’s not very nice.

BRIDGET	Ms. Merryweather!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Yes. What kind of dog race would it be without us?

DANNY	A fair race.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh. That’s mean.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	How about a smile

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	for an old friend?

BRIDGET	We’re not old friends.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	There you go, sweetie.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Girl, you better watch that attitude.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	You’re gonna wind up

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	not that different from me.

DANNY	What do you want?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Well, with you? Nothing, actually. I mean I admit, I did try to prevent you from getting

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	here earlier, but

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	now that I see you on the track… 

MS. MERRYWEATHER	well, I just saw her run.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Timed her, actually.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Sixteen miles per hour.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	She is never gonna win if that’s the best she’s got.

DANNY	She can do better.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Ah, I hope you’re right.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Actually, I don’t hope you’re right.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	That’s just an expression. I hope you’re 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	wrong.

BRIDGET	Why are you here

BRIDGET 	if you can’t race?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Did you know this event is

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	televised?

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	One hundred and twenty million viewers worldwide.

DANNY	That’s more than the Super Bowl.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Well, give or take a hundred million.

BRIDGET	Why are you

BRIDGET 	here?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Besides the chance at eternal fame…

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	well, let’s just say I may have some

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	investment.

DANNY	Investments?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Merryweather Industries is the major sponsor of

MS. MERRYWEATHER	the event this year.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Ah, along with other involvements.

DANNY	You own a

DANNY 	company?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	It’s called a conglomerate,

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	actually. We have subsidiaries

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	all over the world.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	I mean you 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	didn’t really think I made my fortune

MS. MERRYWEATHER	racing wieners, did you?

BRIDGET	Well, kinda.

DANNY	Yeah.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Ah, children.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	So simple.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Hmm.

BRIDGET	Come on,

BRIDGET 	Danny. Let’s head back.

BRIDGET 	They’ll be announcing the racing brackets soon.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Yes, yes. Take care of yourselves.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	We wouldn’t want anything to happen between now and

MS. MERRYWEATHER	the race.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	You go along and take care of yourself.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Maybe I’ll just stay here and

MS. MERRYWEATHER	warm up Princess.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Just in case.

DANNY	Come on, Bridget.

BRIDGET	Come on, Shelly!

DANNY	Looks like we can put off racing Russia.

BRIDGET	At least until they win their bracket, and we win ours.

DANNY	Let’s see. U.S., U.S.A., U.S., U.S., U.S.A. 

DANNY 	U.S., U.S.A. U.S., U.S.A. 

DANNY 	Looks like we’re goin’ last.

BRIDGET	That’s what you save the best for.

BRIDGET 	Come on, Shelly!

SKIP	Judge Brown!
SKIP	Judge Brown!

JUDGE BROWN	Skip!

JUDGE BROWN	Wh- wh- 

JUDGE BROWN 	what are you doing here?

SKIP	Oh. 

SKIP	First I want to apologize. 

SKIP 	Um, I’m really sorry for what I did.

JUDGE BROWN	What did you do?

SKIP	Oh, you don’t know yet. Great, never mind.

SKIP 	It’s nothing. Um, where are my brother and sister?

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, oh they’re in the dorms. 

JUDGE BROWN	Room eight. 

JUDGE BROWN 	But, what, what are you doing with Shelly?

SKIP	Okay. Thanks. Bye.

JUDGE BROWN	Wait,

JUDGE BROWN 	Skip! Wh- wh- what did you do?

JUDGE BROWN 	Oh this can’t be good. Oh heavens to wieners. This cannot be good.

ETSUKO	It’s wrong.

ETSUKO 	Don’t you feel bad?

AYAMEKO	I don’t care how it feels.

AYAMEKO 	I’m paying you, and you do what

AYAMEKO 	you’re paid for.

SKIP	Oh.

SKIP	I’m looking for my brother and sister.

AYAMEKO	Danny and

AYAMEKO 	Bridget?

SKIP	Yeah.

ETSUKO	(chuckles)

SKIP	That’s them.

ETSUKO	Uh, yes, they went to see the racetrack, but they’re in here with

ETSUKO 	my sister tonight.

SKIP 	Oh.

ETSUKO 	We’re from Japan.

SKIP	Nice. That’s cool.

AYAMEKO	Hello. (chuckles)

SKIP	Hi.

ETSUKO	Sorry about the

ETSUKO	melodrama,

ETSUKO 	but um,

ETSUKO 	we’re rehearsing for a play. (chuckles)

SKIP	Huh.

SKIP 	Best Friends.

SKIP	Seems like the

SKIP 	name needs a little bit of work.

SKIP	But, uh,

SKIP 	...seems cool.

ETSUKO	(giggles)

ETSUKO 	You excited for the race?

SKIP	Yeah, well that’s uh, more of my brother and 

SKIP	sister’s thing.

ETSUKO	Mine too.

AYAMEKO	Is that really 

AYAMEKO	Shelly?

SKIP	The one and only.

AYAMEKO	How come you have Shelly

AYAMEKO 	if you haven’t found your brother and sister yet?

SKIP	Yeah, that’s kind of a weird story.

ETSUKO	Yeah, I got a few of those.

SKIP	Actually, I had a

SKIP	question for you. Could you possibly watch

SKIP	Shelly, while I go look for the kids?

ETSUKO	Oh,

ETSUKO	I don’t know.

SKIP	Oh, I mean, if you have somewhere to be or

SKIP	somewhere to go…

AYAMEKO	(overlapping) What are you talking about?

AYAMEKO 	It’s fine. (chuckles)

SKIP	Awesome. 

SKIP 	Thank you.

SKIP	I’ll be back right after I find them.

ETSUKO	Okay.

SKIP	Thank you.

AYAMEKO	He’s cute, if you like that

AYAMEKO 	blonde hair, blue-eyed kinda thing. Too bad we’ll have to crush him.

AYAMEKO	Oh, great.

AYAMEKO 	You have a crush on him.

ETSUKO	No, I just met him.

AYAMEKO	Right. So did I. But I can still tell you like 

AYAMEKO 	him. Keep it in check. ‘Cause if he

AYAMEKO 	likes you back, we might be able to use that.

ETSUKO	(sighs) (to Shelly) We’re only keeping you just through the race, okay? Then it’s back to your family.

AYAMEKO	Stop with the

AYAMEKO 	puppy dog talk to the dog. Okay?

ETSUKO	Sorry.

AYAMEKO	Just remember what I hired you to do.

ETSUKO	Of course.

AYAMEKO	Quick thinking with the

AYAMEKO 	rehearsing the script bit, by the way.

AYAMEKO 	I thought we

AYAMEKO 	were busted.

BRIDGET	You know what they say. Save the best for last. And I think you’re the best.

DANNY	Me too.

BRIDGET	Come on!

BRIDGET	Hey.

BRIDGET 	We’re back.

ETSUKO	Wait. You have Shelly?

DANNY	Of course we do. You saw us leave with her.

ETSUKO	Yes, but…

BRIDGET	But, what?

BRIDGET	What is it?

AYAMEKO	Nothing. It’s just… 

AYAMEKO 	always good 

AYAMEKO  	to see the one and only Shelly.

BRIDGET	Oh, um. They announced the racing brackets. 

BRIDGET	Did you girls see it? You’re in race 

BRIDGET 	number two.

AYAMEKO	Will you stay here while I go take a look?

ETSUKO	Yes, of course!

AYAMEKO	Do what needs to be done.

ETSUKO	Your brother was here looking for you.

DANNY	What?

DANNY 	Skip’s 

DANNY	here?

BRIDGET	That means that Dad found out.

DANNY	This isn’t

DANNY 	good. Where did he go?

ETSUKO	I think he’s headed to the racetrack.

DANNY	We gotta go after him. Can we leave Shelly 

DANNY	here with you?

ETSUKO	Yes, of course. I keep an eye on her.

ETSUKO 	Make sure she’s safe.

DANNY	Thank you.

DANNY	Come on, Bridget.

ETSUKO	It’s okay girl.

ETSUKO	It’s only for 

ETSUKO 	one day. (chuckles)

SKIP	Danny! Bridget! Shelly?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh, uh, I think

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	you just missed them. They were just here.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	You must have crossed paths. I think they were heading back to check the racing brackets.

SKIP	Okay. Uh, thanks.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh, wait. Um, before you go… I have a quick 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	question to ask.

SKIP	Yeah. Sure. What is it?

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Well, if it were just

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	you,

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	...what would you sell that dog for?

SKIP	Okay, no matter how I answer this

SKIP	Ms. Merryweather,

SKIP 	it’s not gonna change a thing because it’s not just me.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	I know. But still…

DANNY	Skip!

DANNY 	What’s going

DANNY	on?

SKIP	Hey, you two!

SKIP	Yeah, okay. I’m sorry.

SKIP 	That was that was really weird.

BRIDGET	Aw, you miss us!

DANNY	Are we being kicked out of 

DANNY	the race?

BRIDGET	Wait,

BRIDGET 	does Dad know that we’re here?

SKIP	Yeah, he doesn’t just know, he actually, uh, he flew out here to 

SKIP 	meet me, and he’s trying to take you two back.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Wait, wait, wait! Your father didn’t know that you 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	came here? 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Uh, excuse me. I really must start warming Princess up.

AYAMEKO 	Two Shellys.

AYAMEKO 	One has got to be

AYAMEKO	real, and one fake.

AYAMEKO 	But why?

ETSUKO	One thing we learn in improv is to never question 

ETSUKO	why. 

ETSUKO 	Just go with the flow.

AYAMEKO	Occasionally you give good advice. Hand me a tissue.

AYAMEKO 	Guess we know which one

AYAMEKO 	is real. We’ll have to switch their collars.

ETSUKO	I don’t wanna do this.

AYAMEKO	Relax. It’s just for the night.

ETSUKO	I don’t know. It doesn’t feel right anymore.

ETSUKO	When you hired me to pretend

ETSUKO 	to be your sister, I thought it was more…

AYAMEKO	More what?

ETSUKO	More sisterly.

ETSUKO 	I thought you were

ETSUKO 	lonely or just wanted someone to walk around with you on campus.

AYAMEKO	(laughs) Do I look lonely

AYAMEKO	to you?

AYAMEKO 	I own the fastest wiener dog

AYAMEKO 	in all of Japan, and

AYAMEKO	soon, the world.

AYAMEKO 	Everyone will wanna be my friend.

ETSUKO	That’s not real friendship.

ETSUKO 	Real friendship doesn’t cost you anything.

AYAMEKO	Everything costs you something.

AYAMEKO 	Lunches, visits… every friendship has a cost. 

AYAMEKO 	Now go put her somewhere quiet 

AYAMEKO 	for the night.

ETSUKO	Okay (sighs), but

ETSUKO	if I get

ETSUKO 	any indication that you might

ETSUKO	hurt her

AYAMEKO	What do I look like to you? A monster?

ETSUKO	Why are you so afraid of this

ETSUKO 	dog?

AYAMEKO	I’m not afraid. It’s

AYAMEKO 	just,  she’s got the drive, the determination to win. 

AYAMEKO  	Keep her out of sight.

PHIL	Hi, I’m looking for

PHIL 	Bridget and Danny.

PHIL 	Shelly?

PHIL 	Come here, girl!

PHIL	Shelly!

PHIL 	She never listens

PHIL	to me. Hi.

PHIL 	How are ya? 

PHIL 	Come on. 

PHIL	Come on.

PHIL	Good girl. 

PHIL 	Is that another dog?

ETSUKO	Um…

AYAMEKO	That’s Yoshi. Our dog. (chuckles)

PHIL	Hi, Yoshi.

PHIL 	Whoa.

PHIL 	Well you put on a few pounds,

PHIL 	...haven’t you?

DANNY	Dad?

SKIP	I thought we were meeting you at the car.

PHIL	I’m really angry at you.

PHIL 	I’m glad you’re okay.

PHIL 	But being glad that you’re okay and okay with what you did are two different things.

BRIDGET	We’re really sorry, Dad.

DANNY	It’s just…

DANNY 	...this race means a lot to us. 

DANNY 	Can we just stay until tomorrow?

DANNY	I mean, 

DANNY 	...we’re, we’re already here.

PHIL	After what you did?

PHIL 	No way.

DANNY	But

PHIL	No buts.

PHIL 	No what ifs. No pleases. I’ve got Shelly. Meet me downstairs.

BRIDGET	But, Dad! What if? Please!

AYAMEKO	I’m sorry to see you go. I was really looking forward to watching Shelly race.

AYAMEKO	I’m sure

AYAMEKO 	she would have surprised everyone. (chuckles)

DANNY	Come on, 

DANNY 	Bridget.

SKIP	So…

SKIP 	...where’s the other dog?

ETSUKO	She’s safe with us. I’ll adopt her.

ETSUKO 	You

ETSUKO 	got the real Shelly back and that’s all that matters.

SKIP	Okay. Ah, well, thank you.

ETSUKO	Skip!

SKIP	Yeah.

ETSUKO	I’m really sorry how it worked out. I know that that 

ETSUKO 	meant a lot to them.

SKIP	Well,

SKIP 	...it’s kinda my fault. I messed up. So… yeah.

SKIP 	I was actually hoping…

SKIP 	...maybe…

ETSUKO	Yes?

SKIP	N- never mind. Yeah, I mean, I’m gonna be leaving town anyways so… it doesn’t really matter. But um…

ETSUKO	Where you going to ask me out?

SKIP	I don’t know. I think so…

AYAMEKO	Sweet. But he’s gone now, so do what I hired you for.

ETSUKO	Maybe we should just give her back. I mean, they’re not even going to race her now.

AYAMEKO	Are you mad? This is high stakes. This is

AYAMEKO 	Internationals. I’m not taking

AYAMEKO 	any chances. Now go put Shelly in a nice, quiet place until after the race. Then she’ll either go back to the family or to the highest bidder.

ETSUKO	You said you weren’t going to hurt her.

AYAMEKO	And I won’t. Don’t worry. The Jack Family still left with a dog.

AYAMEKO 	I doubt they’ll know the difference

AYAMEKO 	without racing her.

DANNY	I can’t believe you’re pulling us from the race.

PHIL	You created the position you’re in. I told you to stay home.

DANNY	And miss the biggest opportunity of me and Shelly’s career?

PHIL	Career? Are you kidding me? You’re nine.

DANNY	I’m ten, Dad.

BRIDGET	We’re really sorry that you had to fly all the way

BRIDGET	out here, but we weren’t in big

BRIDGET 	trouble. You could have just let us stay.

BRIDGET	We would’ve been home before you,  

BRIDGET	and it would have been fine and

PHIL	I’m not discussing this anymore.

BRIDGET	(sighs)

PHIL	Get to bed.

PHIL 	We’re leaving in the morning.

SKIP 	I should probably mention something.

DANNY	What?!

SKIP	Never mind. Yeah,

SKIP 	N Dad’s right. We should probably go to bed.

BRIDGET	Uh, guys…

SKIP	Ooh, yeah.

BRIDGET	Her birthmark’s leaking.

SKIP	Yeah… I think I know what’s causing that.

SKIP 	You’re not gonna like it though.

DANNY	Dad?

ETSUKO	This is just for a little bit, okay?

ETSUKO	I suppose we can’t be friends after

ETSUKO 	all I’m putting you through.

ETSUKO 	Oh, well.

ETSUKO 	Maybe we

ETSUKO 	can. 

ETSUKO 	I’m sorry. (sighs) You shouldn’t 

ETSUKO 	be locked up in here. 

ETSUKO 	You should be out there racing.

DANNY	I can’t believe you could make

DANNY	a fake Shelly.

SKIP	Okay, I’m sorry. It was only supposed to be for a day.

PHIL	Yeah, well Skip, that’s why it’s

PHIL 	necessary to start thinking further ahead than tomorrow.

BRIDGET	Skip! Really?

BRIDGET 	How could you leave Shelly behind like that?

SKIP	Etsuko

SKIP 	said she was the right dog.

BRIDGET	You relied on the enemy

BRIDGET 	for information?

SKIP	Okay. Etsuko is

SKIP 	not the enemy.

BRIDGET	Really?

BRIDGET	She

BRIDGET 	lied to you and stole our dog. You know,  Skip, that’s what most

BRIDGET 	people would call an enemy!

PHIL	Listen,

PHIL 	that’s enough, alright?

PHIL 	We’re gonna get

PHIL 	Shelly, and then we’re gonna go.

PHIL 	We’re not racing. We got a plane to

PHIL	catch in three hours.

PHIL 	Let’s go.

DANNY	Listen to me…

SKIP	Okay.

DANNY	If she has a scratch, you get a scar.

BRIDGET	Oh! 

BRIDGET 	Have you thought of a name for this little guy, besides Fake Shelly yet?

SKIP	Honestly,

SKIP 	I haven’t 

SKIP 	thought that far ahead.

BRIDGET	That’s okay. I’ll think about it for you.

DANNY	How we gonna find Shelly with all these people and dogs around?

BRIDGET	That’s easy. Follow the only person who knows where she is.

DANNY	Where do you think she’s going?

BRIDGET	Let’s find out.

AYAMEKO	What is this?

ETSUKO	(yawns)

ETSUKO	She was cold.

AYAMEKO	She’s our prisoner.

AYAMEKO	You’re not supposed to

AYAMEKO 	cuddle with the prisoners.

ETSUKO	Well, I was cold too.

ETSUKO 	(sighs) Look. Ayameko, I don’t feel good about this whole thing. 

ETSUKO	She should race.

AYAMEKO	You think I went through all this just to have a change of heart?

AYAMEKO	That’s not 

AYAMEKO 	how the world works, Etsuko.

ETSUKO	Fine, well, I’ll just tell them 

ETSUKO	myself.

AYAMEKO	Oh, I’d be scared

AYAMEKO	if they weren’t already halfway across the country by now. Remember

AYAMEKO 	our deal? You go along with this and my sponsor 

AYAMEKO	keeps paying for your college. 

AYAMEKO 	You stop and… bye, bye.

ETSUKO	Well, maybe that’s not such a bad thing.

AYAMEKO	You know wiener dog racing is everything to me.

AYAMEKO 	There’s only a few people on this planet who understand how

AYAMEKO 	badly I want this.

AYAMEKO 	Ms. Merryweather for example, and…

AYAMEKO 	I can’t think of anyone else.

ETSUKO	You’re crazy.

AYAMEKO	There’s a fine line between crazy and genius.

AYAMEKO	I like to think of that line as the starting point to

AYAMEKO 	wiener dog racing.

AYAMEKO	Etsuko. Now let’s get her back in her cage.

AYAMEKO 	We’ll need to bring her to the races so she can watch

AYAMEKO	someone else win.
	
DANNY	Come on!

DANNY 	Why did you

DANNY	take Shelly?

ETSUKO	It’s not what it looks like.

DANNY	What is it then?

ETSUKO	My

ETSUKO 	real name is Cynthia. 

ETSUKO 	I’m not even Japanese. I’m half-Chinese, half Vietnamese.

BRIDGET	I knew it! 

BRIDGET 	Okay, I didn’t know it, know it, but I knew something wasn’t 

BRIDGET	right.

DANNY	Right. Why’d you take Shelly?

ETSUKO	Ayameko hired me to pretend to be her guardian so she could enter the race alone. 

ETSUKO 	She has some kind of sponsor.

DANNY	Merryweather.

ETSUKO	Once she saw that you brought two dogs to the race,

ETSUKO 	she told me to take the real Shelly and hide her.

ETSUKO 	We were going to

ETSUKO 	return her to you after the race.

DANNY	Why would you do that?

DANNY 	We weren’t even going to race.

ETSUKO	I know. But Ayameko doesn’t leave anything to chance.

DANNY	That’s what a race is all about. Chance.

BRIDGET	Yeah.

ETSUKO	Not in her world.

ETSUKO 	(sighs) Look, I know it may not appear this way, but this isn’t me. This isn’t who I am. 

ETSUKO 	You guys still have the fake Shelly, right?

DANNY	Her name’s Tricksy, now.

BRIDGET	She’s with our dad.

ETSUKO	Well, how about we let Tricksy do what she does best?

DANNY	Judge Brown!

DANNY 	I need to speak to you.

JUDGE BROWN	Yeah, make it quick.

JUDGE BROWN 	I’m about to go announce the races. (nonsensical sounds/vocal warm up)

DANNY	What’s that?

JUDGE BROWN	Vocal exercises.

DANNY	Oh.

DANNY	Okay. So, we

DANNY 	picked up Shelly yesterday. At least we thought we did and

JUDGE BROWN	Yeah, you have to excuse me. I, I, I, I am about to walk on 

JUDGE BROWN 	to the stage.

DANNY	The Shelly we picked up

DANNY 	was a fake.

JUDGE BROWN	A fake dog?

DANNY	No, no, no. A fake Shelly.

JUDGE BROWN	What in the wonderful world of wienies would you be doing with a fake 

JUDGE BROWN	Shelly?

DANNY	That’s

DANNY 	a long story.

JUDGE BROWN	Well, I

DANNY	The point is, 

DANNY 	Ayameko dognapped Shelly.
JUDGE BROWN	You mean

JUDGE BROWN 	Ayameko, the champion from Japan?

JUDGE BROWN 	Oh, Danny, Danny.

JUDGE BROWN 	That’s a very serious allegation.

JUDGE BROWN 	Accusing another racer of, of dognapping is a direct

JUDGE BROWN 	violation of rule

JUDGE BROWN 	seven bu- but actually it’s not seven point it might be si- I’m not su

JUDGE BROWN	Make a note. We need to add a rule about dognapping, and dognapping allegation.

JB’S ASSISTANT	Yes, sir.

JUDGE BROWN	Yes. Now, 

JUDGE BROWN 	what is it you need? 

DANNY	Have you noticed how a lot of the dogs have 

DANNY 	similar… 

DANNY 	birthmarks to 

DANNY	Shelly’s?

JUDGE BROWN	Yes. They’re calling it (grunts)

JUDGE BROWN 	the mark of a champion this year.

DANNY	Don’t you find it a bit suspicious?

JUDGE BROWN	You mean, 

JUDGE BROWN	coincidental?

DANNY	No.

DANNY 	I mean suspicious.

DANNY 	We think Ms. Merryweather’s behind

DANNY 	it.

JUDGE BROWN	Ms.

JUDGE BROWN 	Merryweather?

JUDGE BROWN	What would Ms. Merryweather have to do with

JUDGE BROWN	hundreds of dogs having identical

JUDGE BROWN 	birthmark placement? I mean,  

JUDGE BROWN 	(nonsensical sounds/vocal warm up)

DANNY	Cloning.

JUDGE BROWN	That’s ridiculous.

DANNY	It’s not ridiculous.

DANNY 	Merryweather Industries is well known in the scientific world for aggressive experiments.

JUDGE BROWN	Yes, but there wouldn’t—

DANNY	It just Please look into it. 

DANNY 	We made a list of all the different countries 

JUDGE BROWN 	with dogs that have birthmarks like Shelly’s.

JUDGE BROWN	Huh, well, that’s why I have an assistant. 

JUDGE BROWN 	Now, you understand it’s too late for us to do anything about this before the 

JUDGE BROWN	race today.

DANNY	Of course.

JUDGE BROWN	Also,

JUDGE BROWN 	I need to know who will be representing

JUDGE BROWN	the United States?

JUDGE BROWN 	Will it be Ms. Merryweather

JUDGE BROWN	or

JUDGE BROWN 	the Jack Family?

DANNY	I believe we will, Sir.

DANNY	There’s just one more thing we have to do.

JUDGE BROWN	Well, you do understand that by the time I announce the race, you must be seated underneath the U.S. flag or

JUDGE BROWN 	Mrs. Merryweather will race in your place.

DANNY	Yes, sir.

JUDGE BROWN	Yes. (clears throat) (hums)

DANNY	Judge Brown?

JUDGE BROWN	Yes?

DANNY	I owe you.

JUDGE BROWN	(hums) Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.

JUDGE BROWN 	No, no, no, no, no.

JUDGE BROWN 	No, no, no, no, no. Owing me,

JUDGE BROWN 	well, that would be in direct violation of rule two point nine. (hums)

JUDGE BROWN 	(sings) If a dog chews shoes, what shoes would he chew?

DANNY	Rules.

JUDGE BROWN	If a dog chews shoes, what shoes would he chew? (hums) (sings) If a dog 

JUDGE BROWN 	chews shoes, what shoes would he chew? If a dog chews shoes...

JUDGE BROWN	It brings

JUDGE BROWN	me great

JUDGE BROWN	excitement to kick off the thirteenth

JUDGE BROWN	annual Wiener Dog

JUDGE BROWN	Internationals.

JUDGE BROWN	Televised in over one	

JUDGE BROWN	hundred countries.

JUDGE BROWN	Viewed by over

JUDGE BROWN	twenty million

JUDGE BROWN	people. It’s

JUDGE BROWN  	the biggest wiener dog event of the year!

JUDGE BROWN	Thank you!

JUDGE BROWN 	Thank you!

JUDGE BROWN	As some of you may know,

JUDGE BROWN	I was recently asked to take over

JUDGE BROWN  	as head judge for this esteemed organization, after serving for fifteen years for the U.S. Nationals,

JUDGE BROWN	and I am excited

JUDGE BROWN	to be part of this international

JUDGE BROWN	legacy. And now to kick

JUDGE BROWN	us off, open your ears

JUDGE BROWN	and listen to the wonderful recording

JUDGE BROWN	by Barking Tempo

JUDGE BROWN 	of the Internationals theme song.

AYAMEKO	Hello, Jack Family.

DANNY	You don’t scare us.

AYAMEKO	Oh,

AYAMEKO 	good. I just wanted to wish you luck on the race today.

BRIDGET	Really?

AYAMEKO	No! Not really.

BRIDGET	Oh.

AYAMEKO	That was 

AYAMEKO 	sarcasm.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Ah, 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	sarcasm. 

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Something my protégé 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	excels at.

DANNY	Merryweather.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Why the glum 

MS. MERRYWEATHER	face? 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	I mean it’s just a race, 

MS. MERRYWEATHER	right? 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Not like anyone has to get hurt.

DANNY	Right.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh, and I see you brought Shelly.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	I guess that means 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	I’ll be sitting on the sidelines, huh?

DANNY	It’s where you belong.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Let’s just hope she lives up to her reputation. 


MS. MERRYWEATHER	I wouldn’t want her to feel 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	she didn’t belong.

BRIDGET	Yes, I’m sure that would really devastate you.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Have a nice race.

PHIL	You know, for someone who has so much money, you sure do blow a lot of it picking on kids.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh, thanks for noticing.

PHIL	Let’s go!

DANNY	She knows this Shelly’s a fake.

BRIDGET	But she doesn’t know that we know.

JUDGE BROWN	Ladies and

JUDGE BROWN	Gentlemen,

JUDGE BROWN	with sixty-four

JUDGE BROWN	countries present here today it is a verifiable

JUDGE BROWN 	War of the Wieners.

JUDGE BROWN	Now, today you’ll

JUDGE BROWN	witness eight races,

JUDGE BROWN 	with eight dogs in each race. The winner of each race will advance to the final showdown.

JUDGE BROWN	Let’s welcome the racers from our

JUDGE BROWN	first eight countries!

JUDGE BROWN	Canada,

JUDGE BROWN	Australia,

JUDGE BROWN	United Arab Emirates,

JUDGE BROWN	France,

JUDGE BROWN	Switzerland,

JUDGE BROWN	Sweden,	

JUDGE BROWN	Venezuela

JUDGE BROWN	And

JUDGE BROWN  	Russia.	

SKIP	She’s warming up

SKIP 	herself not the dog, but why, why

SKIP 	are you even doing that?

PHIL	Focus on what we’re here

PHIL 	for. We’re here to get Shelly.

SKIP	Alright.

JUDGE BROWN	And now,

JUDGE BROWN 	the moment we have all been waiting for.

JUDGE BROWN	The moment some of us 

JUDGE BROWN	have traveled halfway around the 

JUDGE BROWN	world for. Ladies 

JUDGE BROWN 	and gentlemen, start your wieners!

JUDGE BROWN	I don’t believe it.

JUDGE BROWN 	Russia has been defeated in the first race.

JUDGE BROWN 	Thought to be a favorite, well it turns out that

JUDGE BROWN	Clementine from France has	

JUDGE BROWN 	snatched sweet victory right from the claws of oppressive Mother Russia.

JUDGE BROWN	Unpredictability is one of the many qualities that makes Wiener Dog racing one of the most beloved sports 

JUDGE BROWN	around.

BRIDGET	Aw.

BRIDGET 	I guess you don’t know what to expect in a race like this.

DANNY	I hope 

DANNY 	so.

DANNY 	Go to Etsuko. 

DANNY 	Go! 

DANNY	Go that way. 

DANNY	That way!

BRIDGET	No, to the right!

BRIDGET	Other right!

BRIDGET 	That way, that way! Yeah!

DANNY/BRIDGET	Not the hotdog!

DANNY	It’s not edible!

DANNY 	Okay. That way. Yes. Good.

BRIDGET	Perfect.

DANNY	Yes.

BRIDGET	Bye, Tricksy!

AYAMEKO	We’re up.

AYAMEKO 	This is it.

ETSUKO	Good luck out there.

AYAMEKO	I don’t need luck. Make sure the Jack Family doesn’t get near that dog carrier.

ETSUKO	You got it.

ETSUKO 	Hey, Tricksy.

ETSUKO 	Go to Danny!

DANNY	Shelly!

SUPER FAN	Two-four-six-eight!

SUPER FAN	Who do we appreciate?

SUPER FAN	Shelly! Shelly! 

SUPER FAN	Yay, Shelly!

BRIDGET	Hey, we’re being watched.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	(whispers inaudibly)

PHIL	Hey, now that

PHIL	we got what we came for,

PHIL 	...let’s go.

DANNY	What?

PHIL	I already told you. After what you did, I’m not lettin’ 

PHIL	you race.

DANNY	Dad.

BRIDGET	Look, we got her back. It’s the 

BRIDGET 	most important thing, right?

DANNY	Yeah, I guess so.
BRIDGET	Come on, Danny.


JUDGE BROWN	I, I, I, I don’t believe it.

JUDGE BROWN 	As the racers

JUDGE BROWN 	lead to their marks, it appears the Jack Family 

JUDGE BROWN	have conceded their bench.

SUPER FAN	Boo!

SUPER FAN	Get off their bench!

JUDGE BROWN	Oh.

JUDGE BROWN 	Oh no.

ANNOUNCER	Race two.

JUDGE BROWN	And it looks like this race

JUDGE BROWN 	goes to Japan.

JAPAN	WINS!

JUDGE BROWN	We are leading up

JUDGE BROWN 	to one very exciting final race,

JUDGE BROWN	with France and Japan taking two of the eight spots.

ANNOUNCER	Race three.

JUDGE BROWN	Antarctica,

JUDGE BROWN	win!

ANNOUNCER	Race four.

GERMANY	WINS!

JUDGE BROWN	Germany, win!

JUDGE BROWN	Singapore,

SINGAPORE	WINS!

UNITED KINGDOM	WINS!

JUDGE BROWN	United Kingdom, win!

NEWSCASTER 1	(speaks French)

NEWSCASTER 2	(speaks Japanese) France, Germany and Japan have advanced to the final race.

NEWSCASTER 3	(speaks Russian) Russia, thought to be the favorite to win…lost in their first race. All eyes now turn to the U.S.A.

JUDGE BROWN	Now we are getting down to the final race, and it still appears that Ms. Merryweather is on the U.S. bench.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh, Princess. This is it. This is our big moment.

JUDGE BROWN	The question on everyone’s lips… what happened to the Jack Family?

DANNY	Dad?

BRIDGET	Are we going home?

PHIL	(sighs)

JB’S ASSISTANT 	Excuse

JB’S ASSISTANT 	me.

JB’S ASSISTANT 	(clears throat) Judge Brown, sir.

JUDGE BROWN	Yes, what it is?

JB’S ASSISTANT	I have the results of that research you wanted me to do.

JUDGE BROWN	And?

JB’S ASSISTANT	Well, it’s not looking good, sir. I think the 

JB’S ASSISTANT 	kids may be right.

JUDGE BROWN	Hmm.

JB’S ASSISTANT	There are several instances of known cloning, and Merryweather Industries recently became a sponsor of several of the countries involved.

JUDGE BROWN	Hmm.

JB’S ASSISTANT	In fact, most of today’s winning dogs.

JUDGE BROWN	(gasps) A wiener conspiracy.

JB’S ASSISTANT	I’m afraid so, sir

JUDGE BROWN	Ooh, well.

JUDGE BROWN 	Is there any way we can stop Mrs. Merryweather from racing?

JB’S ASSISTANT	Well, there’s nothing in the rulebook that specifically forbids it.

JUDGE BROWN	(sighs) Now, have you checked all thirty-seven translations, 

JUDGE BROWN 	including Swahili and Ancient Greek?

JB’S ASSISTANT	I don’t believe so, sir.

JB’S ASSISTANT 	I, I, I’ll check again.

JUDGE BROWN	Good. (sighs) This isn’t good. This is not good.

JUDGE BROWN 	I, I, I

JUDGE BROWN 	I don’t believe it. The Jack Family is back.

DANNY	We’d like our bench back.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	You just can’t seem to make up your mind about this whole racing thing, can you?

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	Why don’t you just step aside and let me show you how it’s 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	done.

DANNY	Our mind is made up.

DANNY	We’re doing this race. 

PHIL	Yeah, it’s

PHIL 	time for Shelly to show the world what she’s made of.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Oh, I’ve seen what she’s made of. Literally. (sniffs)

DANNY	These jackets have gotten too tight.

BRIDGET	So last race.

DANNY	Definitely.

JUDGE BROWN	They are 

JUDGE BROWN 	bringing it right down to the wire, as the eighth race is about to begin.

JENNY	Look, look! Look, it’s Shelly! Oh.

JUDGE BROWN	This is excitement.

ANNOUNCER #2	Come and pick your

ANNOUNCER #2	wiener winter wear this Wednesday. 

ANNOUNCER #2	Buy one, get one free!

AYAMEKO	Watch your family go down in the 

AYAMEKO	record books as the worst racers

AYAMEKO 	in U.S. History. (chuckles)

AYAMEKO 	What is this? 

AYAMEKO 	We have the fake Shelly! 

AYAMEKO 	How did this happen?

ETSUKO	Her name’s Tricksy, now. And she’s mine.

JUDGE BROWN	Hmm. There seems to be some sort of commotion 

JUDGE BROWN 	in the Japanese corner 

JUDGE BROWN 	as the eighth and final race takes 

JUDGE BROWN	to the track.

DANNY	This is it, girl.

DANNY 	You can do this.

DANNY 	Listen, win or lose, I love you, okay?

BRIDGET	Excuse me, coming through.

BRIDGET 	Hey.

BRIDGET 	Have fun. (to Shelly) And you, 

BRIDGET 	do what you do best. 

BRIDGET 	Win. Good luck, Shelly! Excuse me.

DANNY	Shelly, you were born to run.

ANNOUNCER	Race eight.

JUDGE BROWN	And the

JUDGE BROWN	U.S. pulls way ahead.

ETSUKO	Yes!

JUDGE BROWN	Shelly Jack

JUDGE BROWN 	possessed as she pumps her way 

JUDGE BROWN 	to the finish line.

AYAMEKO	No!

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, my gosh! I think Shelly Jack

JUDGE BROWN 	has set world records today!

AYAMEKO	This is

AYAMEKO 	not how it’s supposed to go down. You’re fired, Etsuko. 

AYAMEKO 	Fired!

ETSUKO	You can’t fire me. 

ETSUKO	I already quit.

JUDGE BROWN	Eight races have been

JUDGE BROWN 	completed today, folks. And here is who remains for the final.

JUDGE BROWN	France,

JUDGE BROWN	Japan,

JUDGE BROWN	Germany,

JUDGE BROWN	Jamaica,

JUDGE BROWN	Singapore,

JUDGE BROWN	United Kingdom,

JUDGE BROWN	Antarctica

JUDGE BROWN	and the U.S.A.

JUDGE BROWN 	We are now gonna let the racers regroup, but sit tight people, because the final race

JUDGE BROWN 	is about to begin.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Uh, this is a private area. Uh, private. Private. Shoo! (scoffs)

SKIP	Hey,

SKIP 	...uh… 

SKIP 	Thanks.

ETSUKO	For what? (sighs) Stealing your dog?

SKIP	Well, maybe not for that part, but you know…

SKIP 	for the other stuff.

SKIP 	You know,

SKIP 	where you helped and stuff.

ETSUKO	You’re welcome.

SKIP	You know,

SKIP 	since you don’t actually live in Japan…

SKIP 	you know, I mean,

ETSUKO 	I, I, I

SKIP 	don’t know… maybe

SKIP 	...maybe we could

ETSUKO	Meet at another race?

ETSUKO 	I’m joking.

ETSUKO 	I’d love to see you again.

SKIP	Good. 

SKIP 	I, I mean, if that’s what you want.

ETSUKO	Yeah. (chuckles)

ETSUKO 	You know, I think Tricksy is taking a liking to me.

ETSUKO 	You think she may wanna adopt me?

SKIP	I think she’ll make room for you.

AYAMEKO	You’ve gotten this far,

AYAMEKO 	but that doesn’t mean you won.

DANNY	Nope.

DANNY 	Just means we have a chance.

AYAMEKO	Not much of a chance if you ask

AYAMEKO	me. You notice

AYAMEKO 	something about most of these 

AYAMEKO 	dogs you’re up against?

DANNY	They’re all cute.

AYAMEKO	A lot of them have birthmarks

AYAMEKO 	exactly where Shelly does.

DANNY	You said that was the mark of a champion, right?

AYAMEKO	Merryweather Industries cloned your 

AYAMEKO 	dog, Danny. 

AYAMEKO 	Shelly’s racing a 

AYAMEKO	bunch of Shellys. 

AYAMEKO	And one of us 

AYAMEKO 	is going to win.

DANNY	That’s not true!

BRIDGET	They don’t all look alike.

AYAMEKO	Improvements on the original.

AYAMEKO 	I don’t care if you believe me. I didn’t tell you so we could be friends. 

AYAMEKO	I told you, so 

AYAMEKO 	you know exactly what you’re up against.

DANNY	There’s only one Shelly.

AYAMEKO	Not today.

JUDGE BROWN	Ladies and

JUDGE BROWN 	Gentlemen, we are

JUDGE BROWN 	calling the racers back to the track. The final race is about 

JUDGE BROWN	to begin.

AYAMEKO	I’d say good

AYAMEKO 	luck, but, you know…

BRIDGET	Look, don’t listen to her. Okay, I don’t care if Ms. Merryweather did clone Shelly.

BRIDGET	They were basically just 

BRIDGET	a bunch of blank slates 

BRIDGET 	when they were born. They won’t have 

BRIDGET 	this girl’s heart.

DANNY	I hope you’re right.

BRIDGET	Me too.

JUDGE BROWN	This is it. The final moment. The winner of this race will be the winner of the Internationals.

JUDGE BROWN 	A full year of preparation.

JUDGE BROWN	A full day of races have led us

JUDGE BROWN	all

JUDGE BROWN 	to this moment.

JUDGE BROWN	And the bell

JUDGE BROWN 	will ring

JUDGE BROWN	in five…

JUDGE BROWN	four…

JUDGE BROWN 	three…

JUDGE BROWN	two…

JUDGE BROWN	one…

JUDGE BROWN	Ring it!

AYAMEKO	Come on, Yoshi!

AYAMEKO	Move your feet!

ETSUKO 	Come on, Shelly! Come on!

AYAMEKO 	Come on!

DANNY 	Come on!

JUDGE BROWN	Wow-wee. Wow! Wieners!

JUDGE BROWN 	That was a close one.

JUDGE BROWN 	Oh, we’re gonna have to go to the cameras to see that.

SHELLY JACK	WINS!

JENNY	She did it!

DANNY	Yay!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	No, no, no!
 
PHIL	I’m still mad at you. But I’m really proud of you, too.

BRIDGET	Oh…

PHIL	Good job.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	This isn’t over, Shelly. 

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	We’ll be back next year. Right, Princess?

JB’S ASSISTANT	Ms. Ms. Ms. Merryweather? Um, you’ll need to come with us. The uh, with the security guard. We have to ask you a few questions about Merryweather Industries.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Everything I did was within the confines of the rulebook.

JUDGE BROWN	You may not be technically breaking the rules today, Ms. Merryweather,

JUDGE BROWN 	but rule four-point-two-six clearly states that we reserve the right to add a decimal point to the rulebook.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	You wouldn’t.

JUDGE BROWN	Oh, wouldn’t I?

JUDGE BROWN 	You may have bought your way out of your last race.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	You can’t ban me from

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	racing, Judge Brown.

MS. MERRYWEATHER 	I’ll find a way.

JUDGE BROWN	I know you will. And I’ll be right there,

JUDGE BROWN 	waiting in the wings of the great Wiener Hall to stop 

JUDGE BROWN	you. 

JUDGE BROWN 	Now, 

JUDGE BROWN	...take her 

JUDGE BROWN 	away!

MS. MERRYWEATHER	Wiener Hall?

BRIDGET	So, do you think we’re done with

BRIDGET 	this whole wiener dog-racing thing for a while?

DANNY	I don’t know. Ask her.

PHOTOGRAPHER	Can I get a quick picture of you two and Shelly?

DANNY	Sure.

BRIDGET	Yeah.

PHOTOGRAPHER	She is an international

PHOTOGRAPHER 	treasure.

BRIDGET	(laughs)

JENNY 	Okay.

JENNY 	I’m about ready to head home. Got my bunny loaded in the car. She was such a good find. And this, for my

JENNY 	mediation room. 

JENNY 	I just need to fill my hug meter.

BRIDGET	(laughs lightly)

JENNY	Ah,

JENNY 	so many hugs.

ALL	(laughs)

SKIP	I’m sorry for tricking you.

JENNY	Hey, you put that

JENNY 	brain to some better uses, you might

JENNY 	change the world.

SKIP	Maybe I can clone something.

DANNY	Just hope you don’t clone yourself.

SKIP	Hey.

PHIL	Hey! So, you’re taking off?

JENNY	Yep. It’s about that time. Oh, Melanie called.

JENNY 	Um, she said she’s back in town,

JENNY 	and she wanted you to meet her

JENNY	in St. Joseph’s. 

JENNY 	Michigan’s most romantic 

JENNY 	city.

PHIL	What? Now?

JENNY	Look, I mean the sooner the better. 

JENNY 	I... 

JENNY 	may have let it slip about what you were planning to do. 

ALL 	(laughs) 

PHIL	Why would you do that?

JENNY	Well, she needed to know

JENNY 	that the reason you went to see her, and the reason you left before

JENNY 	proposing were the same.

JENNY 	Family.

BRIDGET	Go, Dad.

BRIDGET 	This is your chance to be super romantic.

DANNY	Instead of all grouchy.

PHIL	Oh, really?  (to Skip) What do you think?

SKIP	Yeah, Dad. Relax. I got the rugrats.

BRIDGET	Go!

PHIL	Sure?

JENNY	Come on, I’ll drive ya! 

SKIP	Yeah.

JENNY 	I’m great at watchin’ 

JENNY 	proposals. Hardly know I’m there.

PHIL	Okay. I'll, I'll, I'll go.

PHIL 	Thank you, guys.

BRIDGET	Go!

PHIL	Thanks, guys.

DANNY	Go!

SKIP	Go on, go! Get outta here. You got it.

BRIDGET	Go!

BRIDGET	Go! Go!

PHIL	Okay, okay.

DANNY	And remember Dad. It’s a marathon, not a race.

PHIL	I will remember that.

SKIP	So, is anybody ready for a new adventure?

BRIDGET	We’re always ready for a new adventure.

DANNY	You know, I hear there’s some really great wiener dog races 

DANNY	happening in Mexico.

SKIP 	I’m not going to Mexico for a wiener dog race.

DANNY 	I knew you’d say that. So I actually made an itinerary of other things to do in Mexico while me and Bridget race.

BRIDGET 	Oh, and we can sing that ninety-nine hotdogs song again! But maybe this time let’s start at one thousand!

SKIP 	Yeah. Not a chance!

SOUNDTRACK 	It’s not our first time. We’ve been here before. We won’t stop trying when they’re gonna shut the door. We’re on the right track; There’s no looking back. No matter who you are; we’re all shining stars. On your mark, get ready, yeah. On your mark get ready. (Ready, set, go! Hey!) Together we can do it; I’m by your side for the long ride, baby, around the world you and I, we’re heading back to the starting line. Scream and shout (unintelligible) Set to race, set the pace at the starting line.

NEWSCASTER 1	Merryweather Industries was shutdown today due to mass speculation of tampering with the integrity of the Wiener Dog Internationals, a much loved family event.

NEWSCASTER 2	Over one hundred and fifty cloned dogs were taken away from the scene, and oddly all of them were given homes in the small town of New Glarus, Wisconsin.

NEWSCASTER 3	It’s not clear whether Ms. Merryweather will be going to jail or paying a large fine but one thing is certain, she’s not the winner of this race.

MS. MERRYWEATHER	No. No. No, no, no, no! Just go away! I have no comment. No comment! Hear me? Just… (sighs) So rude! What has happened to the press?

NEWSCASTER 4	Merryweather Industries was taken down today,

NEWSCASTER 4 	as speculation for its contribution to cloned wiener dogs everywhere sent proponents of wiener dog racing into a flurry of allegations and lawsuits. The Jack Family, whose dog Shelly Jack, named in honor of shelter dogs everywhere, had this to say…

DANNY	We’ve had run-ins with Ms. Merryweather in the past. So I guess it’s not that surprising what she did.

BRIDGET	She’s a pretty mean lady for sure, but she’s also kind of brilliant. I mean, who would have ever thought she could 

BRIDGET 	be cloning something and still remain so classy. 

BRIDGET 	But in an evil kind of way. 

BRIDGET	Told ya we’d see more reporters.

DANNY	(mimics Bridget) Told ya we’d see more reporters.

SOUNDTRACK	You can do it, yeah. You can make it. (Hey!) Getting’ ready, yeah, come on shake it. (ooh, ooh) You can do it, yeah. You can make it. (Hey!) Scream and shout, raise your hands, you can do it now. You can do it (yeah!) You can make it (hey!) Get ready (yeah!) Come on, shake it. (Ooh Ooh!) You can do it. (Yeah) You can make it. (Hey!) Scream and shout, raise your hands, you can do it now. Together we can do it. I’m by your side for the long ride baby. Around the world you and I. we’re heading back to the starting line. Scream and shout and pretend that you don’t mind. Set the race, set the pace at the starting line. Heading back to the starting line, heading back to the starting line. Heading back to the starting line. To the starting line. Scream and shout and pretend that you don’t mind. On your mark, get ready, set, go!
