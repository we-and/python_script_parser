PYTHON	What a beautiful day, my little friend...

PYTHON	Congratulations. Becoming my meal is a great honor for you.

PYTHON	(hissing)

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

PYTHON	(grunt)

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

MR PANDA	Well? Are you up to your old tricks again? You just refuse to listen, even though I warned you. Fine, let's do it the hard way then.

PYTHON	Take it easy, friend. Let’s talk like civilized animals. (grunt) Give me those monkeys. They’re mine.

MR PANDA	Uh-uh. Not convinced.

PYTHON	(choking)

PYTHON	Just you wait, beefcake! My memory is longer than my tail. And will be sorry, very soon! (hiss off-screen)

MRS PANDA	What is going on? (on) Come on, we’ve got lots of work to do!

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

MR PANDA	Yes, dear. Right away, dear. I'll be right there.

MR PANDA	We have a bit of fun with the guys here. Just like old times.	

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds, surprised gasps)

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds >on-screen)

MIC-MIC	(grunts, scared sounds, panting, sounds)

MIC-MIC	What?

MIC-MIC	Phew, I'm so glad it was just a dream! (gasp) (off) Oh!

MIC-MIC	Today, you will witness a rocket being launched for the Moon carrying this forest's first space traveler, Oscar the Hare.

MIC-MIC	What? Oscar? (sounds, spits)

TITLE	BIG TRIP

MIC-MIC	(relaxed grunts)

BENNY	Mister Mic-Mic? Mister Mic-Mic!

MIC-MIC	(sigh)

BENNY	Good morning! Are you coming to see the rocket launch?

MIC-MIC	Absolutely not! And you should do the same (scoffs) There’s nothing to see there.

BENNY	Alright! (giggle) Suit yourself. (singing without lyrics)

MIC-MIC	Oh my.

HOUSTON	Hey there, Mic-Mic. Are you coming to watch the rocket launch?

MIC-MIC	No, Houston! I don't have time for nonsense.

HOUSTON	But... (short laugh) It's not nonsense. Your friend Oscar is going to the Moon.

MIC-MIC	Oscar is not my friend!

HOUSTON	Okay, I see. (short laugh) No more questions. (singing)

HOUSTON	So you're not coming?

MIC-MIC	(frustrated sounds) No!!!

HOUSTON	Why didn’t you just say so? What's up with all the yelling? Gosh, sometimes (off) you just need to chill out.

MIC-MIC	(humming)

STEVIE RAY	Oh, what the…?

MIC-MIC	Huh? (screaming)

STEVIE RAY	Who’s there?!

MIC-MIC	I am there!

STEVIE RAY	And where is there?

MIC-MIC	(grunt) Well, I thought that I was home where I had privacy.

STEVIE RAY	Ah! Mic-Mic! It is you, huh? (off) I heard they're launching a rocket to (on) the Moon. I can’t see a thing, but I had a brilliant idea! Why don't you come along and tell me everything that happening all around?

MIC-MIC	Come on! Do you really believe he's going on that flight?

STEVIE RAY	A kite? No, he’s not using a kite. He’s using a rocket!

MIC-MIC	I don’t care if he flies in his own pocket! Cause I am not going…

STEVIE RAY	Why crowing? There's no crowing, I'm talking about your friend Oscar who’s going to the Moon.

MIC-MIC	Oscar is not my friend! He's NOT!

MIC-MIC	I don't need friends. Got it, Stevie? Hm.

STEVIE RAY	I got it, I got it. I am glad you're coming! I'll be on my way. You catch up. See you at the launch pad!

MIC-MIC	(gasp, sounds, grunts)

STEVIE RAY	(humming)

MIC-MIC	(short laugh) Whew. Hm.

OSCAR	My friends! Today is definitely the day. The Moon is within our reach. And you know what? That's one small step for a hare…

OSCAR	…Yet one giant leap for the whole animal kingdom! Hey, have you, guys, seen Mic- Mic?

BENNY/HOUSTON/STEVIE RAY Uh-uh!

BENNY	He said he's not coming.

HOUSTON	Yeah, not a chance.

OSCAR	Well, haters gonna hate. I will not let them win! I will prove to him... I mean them... I mean everyone!

OSCAR	Switch on! Ignition sequence start.

HOUSTON	Huh?

OSCAR	Oops! I forgot the fuel.

HOUSTON	(confused sounds)

BENNY	(confused sounds)

STEVIE RAY	It happens.

BENNY	Come on!

OSCAR	We got a lift-off!

BENNY	Houston, (on) we’ve got a problem!

HOUSTON	Yeah, we most certainly do…

STEVIE RAY	Did you just say, a serpent flew too? No, no, I’m sure Oscar is flying that rocket all by himself!

OSCAR	(screaming)

BENNY	Good-bye, Oscar.

HOUSTON	Good-bye, friend…

STEVIE RAY	Have a safe journey!

MIC-MIC	My dizzy bees.

MIC-MIC	Mmm! (gasp)

MIC-MIC	(sounds, gasps)

MIC-MIC	Hm? (gasp)

MIC-MIC	(scream) (gasp, sounds)

MIC-MIC	Oops!

OSCAR	(screaming >on-screen)

OSCAR	(screaming >on-screen, panting)

OSCAR	Sweet trousers!

MIC-MIC	Time to get out of here.

OSCAR	Get out of here? Right now?

MIC-MIC	Yes and right now!

OSCAR	My ears!

MIC-MIC	(frustrated sounds)

OSCAR	Whoa.

STORK 25	Wild-beak-two, do you copy? How is the weather over Paris?

STORK 26	It’s ok. The sky is clear. But we expect a little rain today. How about you?

STORK 25	I’m flying to India. Hope to avoid turbulence when I fly over Mumbai,

STORK MANAGER	Stop the chatter, boys! Keep this channel clear. Good luck to everyone!

STORK 1	Oh! (on) Look guys, it’s Karl!

STORK 2	I cannot believe they hired him back.

STORK 1	I guess, the management really desperate.

STORK 2	He’s on probation for now.

STORK 1	What poor animal are you delivering this time, Karl?

STORK 3	He’s got a baby panda. (short laugh) Great.

STORK 2	Don’t mess it up, Karl.

STORK 1	Like when you delivered a baby zebra to a horse couple!

STORK 1,	STORK 2,

STORK 3	(laugh)

ZEBRA	(sounds)

MALE HORSE	(confused sounds)	

DONKEY	(sounds, braying >off-screen)

MALE HORSE	(sounds, neighing)

STORK 2, 3	It was fun!

STORK 1	Don't try to take that baby to a bear, Karl.

KARL	Oh, don't you worry! It's okay, little baby, everything is under control. (gasp)

KARL	(scared sounds)

KARL	(reacts, screaming, reacts)

KARL	Wait…/ I'm totally confused. Who is this baby for? Pandas or bears? (off) Hm?

KARL	Right! I remember! Of course, it was bears. There's no doubt about it! Heh! (gasp, reacts)

MIC-MIC	Two words for you, Oscar. Long-eared rocket man!

OSCAR	Listen, I understand that you're probably upset.

MIC-MIC	Who's upset? I am upset?

OSCAR	Yeah.

MIC-MIC	No, not at all, buddy. I am furious!!!

OSCAR	I’m very sorry, buddy, but it’s your own fault, you know. You set up those beehives in the wrong order. That’s why they fell down. (falls down, reacts)

MIC-MIC	(heavy breathing)

OSCAR	All you had to do was set them up the right way. And then, even a dozen bunnies coming crashing down from the skies would not be able to break them.

MIC-MIC	Are you insane, rocket-hare? Why on earth do you go around telling everyone that we are friends? We are not friends, Oscar. You’re nothing but a pathetic loser who always gets into trouble. Nothing good ever comes out of your mischief, absolutely nothing!

OSCAR	What are you talking about? You kept saying the rocket would never fly, but it did!

MIC-MIC	Your stupid rocket flew so well, it turned my favorite boat into a Swiss cheese! All my beehives are ruined! And you nearly killed me!

OSCAR	But I didn't, right?

MIC-MIC	Yeah? Remember, how you decided to dam the river, and my house got flooded?

OSCAR	I just wanted to make a lake and raised trout.

MIC-MIC	Then you decided to drill a hole in my garden to pump oil, remember that fluff-head? And out came a fountain of boiling hot water!

OSCAR	And then a beautiful coconut tree grew in its place!

MIC-MIC	Except I don't even like coconuts!

OSCAR	I'm sorry, I couldn't really hear you. Could you repeat what you just said?

MIC-MIC	Yes. I said, get out!

OSCAR	Okay, you're absolutely right. But I swear, things will be different now. I’ve thought it all through. Do you believe me?

OSCAR	I can help you if you want! Collect the harvest. Bring the bees back. Forget the bees, I’ll make the honey myself, who needs bees.

MIC-MIC	No way. Go home.

OSCAR	The thing is, my house is kind of blown to pieces… More like turned to dust, I’d say. Can I stay at your place for a while, huh?

MIC-MIC	(grunt) So this is why you’re calling yourself my friend.

OSCAR	No, I didn't mean it like that. Look, we make perfect partners, you and I. A superhare like me always needs a superbear like you! (17:04) Together, we will be like Batman and Robin, (off) like d’Artagnan and the three musketeers, (exhale) like Bonnie and Clyde (on) like…like… like... (gasp) like Dolce and Gabbana!

MIC-MIC	Yeah, yeah.

MIC-MIC	(sound) No way. I don't want to be like Dolce and Gabbana with you.

OSCAR	Yeah? What about the three musketeers?

MIC-MIC	Forget about it. Ow!

MIC-MIC	(efforts)

OSCAR	We'll be famous in no time. Oh, the places we'll go. We'll be on our way up! We'll be seeing great sights! We will rock the world!

MIC-MIC	No!

OSCAR	Oh, come on! Give me a chance!

BABY	(babbling)

BABY	(babbling >on-screen)

OSCAR	Baby panda. Mic-Mic, why did you order this?

MIC-MIC	I didn’t.

BABY	(babbling) (18:16) (babbling)

BABY	(crying >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	(reacts) (18:37) Oscar, do something! I'm begging you! I cannot stand it when babies cry. It drives me nuts!

BABY	(crying >on-screen, then off-screen)

OSCAR	He's just hungry. I heard babies cry when they want something to eat.

MIC-MIC	Really? So what do they eat?

OSCAR	All babies drink milk.

MIC-MIC	Are you sure?

OSCAR	I think so.

MIC-MIC	Where do we get milk?

OSCAR	Um... I got it!

OSCAR	Mic-Mic, how about we keep this baby, huh? He’s so cute. (on) You can be his Daddy, and I can be…

MIC-MIC	Stop right there! (on) I want my regular life back and this is absolutely unregular...

BABY	(babbling)

MIC-MIC	…a baby panda in my house. He has to go back to his parents immediately. They’re probably worried sick by now.

OSCAR	Really? What should we do?

MIC-MIC	We? Who said anything about “we”? Forget about it.

MIC-MIC	Well, it really is a baby panda. (off) Pandas live in bamboo forests far off in the South.

MIC-MIC	Heh, sounds like a big trip. (off) But if I sail down the river, well, it just might be doable.

OSCAR	(gasp) Down the river?

OSCAR	You’ve got to find a way to go with them, Oscar. Come on, think! Think, there’s gotta be a way!

OSCAR	Mic-Mic, are you sure you don't need any help?

MIC-MIC	Not from you.

OSCAR	I could be your first mate.

MIC-MIC	Get lost!

OSCAR	Wait, I can help with the supplies. (efforts) Why is it so heavy? (sounds)

MIC-MIC	(effort) Get out of here!

OSCAR	Don’t give up, Oscar, there's gotta be a way. You just gotta think hard. Come on. Come o-on.

OSCAR	(crying) Mic-Mic, please, you gotta take me with you. For the sake of our friendship, please, you gotta!

MIC-MIC	I already told you, I am not taking you. We won't last a mile with you on board. And we're not friends, alright Oscar? Goodbye and good luck!

OSCAR	Okay, okay. If that’s the way you wanted. I’ll just…

MIC-MIC	(spits) Oh, and you know what, Oscar…

OSCAR	Hm?

MIC-MIC	Rebuild my beehives before I come back!

MIC-MIC	Gosh, what a clown!

OSCAR	Mic-Mic? You really want to leave me here all by myself?

MIC-MIC	Now that’s paradise! It’s a good thing Oscar is not around. Heh.

MIC-MIC	(singing) Don’t worry… Be happy.

OSCAR	(muffled sounds)

OSCAR	(muffled sounds)

MIC-MIC	(gasp) What’s that?

MIC-MIC	(effort)

OSCAR	(muffled sounds)

MIC-MIC	Huh?

MIC-MIC	Now, that's interesting. (blows)

OSCAR	(screaming) I can fly! Woo-hoo! (laugh)

OSCAR	(screaming)

OSCAR	Holy moly! (scream)

OSCAR	Ow. Ouch.

MIC-MIC	Oscar…

OSCAR	Hey, Mic-Mic. I was just, you know, passing by. Thought I’d drop in for a cup of tea.

MIC-MIC	Well, hello. And goodbye.

OSCAR	Or maybe, I could stay for a bit?

MIC-MIC	No and never. Get out now!

BABY	(babbles) (on) (crying >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	(reacts)

OSCAR	(singing La Cucaracha >on-screen)

MIC-MIC	(reacts)

OSCAR	Cha-cha-cha!

BABY	(laugh >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	Okay, you can stay, cha-cha-cha. Make yourself useful for a change.

BABY	(laugh)

OSCAR	I promise, you will not regret it. I…

MIC-MIC	You zip it. Understood?

OSCAR	Mhmm. (giggle)

BABY	(laugh)

MIC-MIC	And you too. Huh. (humming La Cucaracha) Oh, man. Stupid song.

DUKE	I remember it, as if it were yesterday. I was crossing (on) Africa with a flock of ducks. So, here we were, by (off) Mount Kilimanjaro, when suddenly, Eagles attacked us! (on) Oh mon Dieu! What a fight it was! Let me tell you, I fought like a wild beast, and I won!

DUKE	Thanks to me, everyone was safe and sound, and the Queen of Ducks gave me her heart…

DUCKS	(laugh)

DUKE	Why are you laughing? I'm telling you the truth!

BIG DRAKE	(cough) Tell me, Duke. Aren't you tired of your lies? No one around here believes you anymore. Do you, guys, know why he has such a huge beak?

DUCKS	(sounds: uh-uh)

BIG DRAKE	Because he needs enough room to hold his blabbering tongue.

DUKE	(gasping)

DUCKS	(laugh)

DUKE	Hm. Well, do you, guys, know why he has such a tiny head? Because it perfectly fits his teeny-tiny brain!

BIG DRAKE	(sounds)

DUCKS	(laugh)

FIRST DUCK	Wait, what? Does that mean my brain is teeny-tiny too?

SECOND DUCK	Or mine?	

BIG DRAKE	At least we are smart enough to know when we are not welcome!

DUKE	Oh, I will leave, but it's your loss! You will never get to know the true power of imagination! I'm off to tell the whole world about (off) my adventures!

DUCKS	(laugh)

BIG DRAKE	Goodbye and good riddance, you over feathered decoy.

DUKE	(short laugh) (on) Oh, Duke, don’t take it too close to heart. They didn’t even understand who they had the pleasure of speaking to. Their whole reason of existence is to become a Peking duck. (screaming)

DUKE	(sounds of relief) Oh! Would you look at that? What do we have here?
DUKE	Ladies and gentleman, please make sure your seat belts are securely fastened and your seats are in upright position. We’re beginning to descent. Woo-hoo!

MIC-MIC	(yawn) Okay, Oscar, the wheel is all yours. And I'm going to have a nice nap. (off) You stay the course and make sure the baby doesn't cry. (on) Got it?

OSCAR	Aye-aye, captain!

MIC-MIC	Clown…

BABY	(babbles)

OSCAR	It’s an inside joke, you know. (laugh, effort)

OSCAR	(screaming)

DUKE	Bonjour, my friends! (laugh)

DUKE	Mon chéri, let me tell you a story. Once, I took part in a sailing race in the Strait of Gibraltar…

OSCAR	I'm sorry, a sailing race where?

DUKE	What? You set sail without any theoretical knowledge? A Strait of Gibraltar is a strait between… um...

MIC-MIC	Who are you exactly?

DUKE	Let me introduce myself, I am Duke the Pelican, a traveler, a humanist, and also a philanthropist.

MIC-MIC	Good-bye, humanthropist! Good riddance! Fly safe! Bon voyage! Hm!

DUKE	But I was hoping for a cup of tea with a splash of milk, maybe, in return I would love to tell you about…

MIC-MIC	You were hoping, huh? We don't serve tea on Fridays.

DUKE	Is it Friday already? Let me tell you a story, when I served at the Great Sultan's Harem, every Friday we used to…

MIC-MIC	Get off my raft!

BABY	(crying)

MIC-MIC	(reacts) Oscar!

OSCAR	Just a sec.

OSCAR	(singing La Cucaracha)

MIC-MIC	(frustrated roar, hitting his head)

DUKE	Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, when I babysat the future Queen of England. Now, when was this?.. If I remember correctly… Right, George the Fifth was a king back then… And you know what? Um... Hm...

BABY	(laughing >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	Huh?

DUKE	But I guess… You're not interested in all that, are you?

MIC-MIC	No, Duke. Tell us all about it. Come on, tell us. I’ll be thrilled to listen to all of your stories.

DUKE	Oh, really?

DUKE	Let me tell you another story. Once, I was at the reception of Pharaoh Two-tongue-come- on the Fifteenth. I don't know why he was called that, I am pretty sure he had just one tongue.

BABY	(laughing)

DUKE	By the way, where are we going?

OSCAR	We're taking this baby panda back to his parents.

DUKE	Oh, a noble mission. I’m so honored.

MIC-MIC	Okay, Oscar, turn to shore. It's time we roast this goose.

DUKE	But you can’t roast me I’m not a goose.

MIC-MIC	That’s too bad. I’m really hungry.

JANUS	(scared sounds >on-screen)

OWL	(hoot)

JANUS	(gasp, fall)

FEAR	Well, look at you. All seized up again?

JANUS	(stammering) Who's there?

FEAR	Good question. Who do you think?

JANUS	Well… um... I don’t know.

FEAR	Come on, think really hard.

JANUS	(efforts)

FEAR	You do know. (short laugh) Because I am

you!

JANUS	What? (whimpering) No. I’m me.

FEAR	That's right but… I am the best part of you.

JANUS	The best?

FEAR	Yes. I am your fear.

JANUS	(whimper)

FEAR	I came here to tell you that (yawn) I am proud of you. You are so scared of everything around you, that the fear literally paralyzes you.

JANUS	(stammering) But... But I do not want to be scared.	

FEAR	Oh, but you should. This forest right here is the worst place to be. It is full of spine- chilling horrors and hidden dangers!

FEAR	Hear this rustling?

JANUS	(whimper)

FEAR	Or that squeaking?

FEAR	Wild animals everywhere!

JANUS	(whimper) (32:28) (reacts, falls down)

FEAR	Paralyzed by fear, just like I said.

JANUS	But I’m so tired of being afraid. I'm shunned by my own pack.

FEAR	It's a good thing! (short laugh) They are not worthy of you. They are fools (off) pretending (on) that they have courage. They’re unhappy because being brave is the most tiring thing in the world.

JANUS	(whimper) No! You don’t exist. You are a figment of my imagination. You are just a hallucination.

FEAR	A hallucination? You can touch me if you want.	

JANUS	No. I’m scared of you.

FEAR	That’s right. You should be. Good boy. 

JANUS	Go away! Get out of my head, leave me alone. Get out! Get out! Get out!!!

FEAR	Trust me, boy, you can't get rid of me that easily. No, you are stuck with me forever and ever!

MIC-MIC	Oscar, leave me alone. (snoring)

DUKE	And then they asked me, "Chicken or fish"? And I said, (off) I don’t eat fish.

OSCAR	(yawn) Everyone's asleep.

BABY	(snoring >on-screen)

MIC-MIC	(snoring)

OSCAR	(reacts, falls asleep, snoring)

OSCAR	Mic-Mic?

MIC-MIC	What is it now?

OSCAR	I never told this to anybody, but my real parents were bears.

MIC-MIC	(sigh)

OSCAR	My Dad went missing out at sea many years ago, and my Mom went looking for him and never came back.

MIC-MIC	Really?

OSCAR	I was brought up by a family of hares.

MIC-MIC	Son, is that you?

OSCAR	Daddy?

MIC-MIC	My son!

OSCAR	Daddy!

MIC-MIC	My son.

OSCAR	Daddy.

OSCAR	And you’re not mad that I turned your favorite boat into a Swiss cheese?

MIC-MIC	No, of course not, it's just a boat.

OSCAR	Even though we're now sinking because of me?

MIC-MIC	Who cares? You are my son. What? We're sinking? (screaming)

MIC-MIC	(screaming >on-screen)

OSCAR	(gasp)

MIC-MIC	Huh? Huh?

OSCAR	What’s wrong? Mic-Mic?

MIC-MIC	(grunt) Nothing's wrong. I’ve just had the most awful dream. Whew.

OSCAR	Something scary?

MIC-MIC	You’re not gonna believe this. I dreamt, that you, Oscar, were my son.

OSCAR	Me too.

MIC-MIC	Whoa, can you imagine? That would be a nightmare!

OSCAR	Yeah, of course. A terrible dream. Not a cool dream at all.

OSCAR	Okay, Duke, it’s your turn to keep watch. 

MIC-MIC	Well… I guess, I’ll turn in too. And you Duke, keep an eye on the baby. If he cries, just tell him one of your endless stories.

DUKE	I’ll tell him about that time when Leonardo Da Vinci asked me to pose for Mona Lisa’s portrait. (37:28) But then he changed his mind and he replaced my splendid beak with his neighbor’s ugly face.

MIC-MIC	For all I care, you can tell him you went to the ball with Cinderella along with Snow White! Just remember, your job/ is to keep him quiet.

JANUS	(panting) Leave me alone! Get out of my head! (panting) (on) You don’t exist! You're not real. Get… Get out of my head!

JANUS	(panting) (on) You're not real! You're not (slow-motion) real! (normal speed) Get away! Get away! (off) (panting)

DUKE	(falling down)

JANUS	(whimper)

MIC-MIC	And who are you?

JANUS	(stammering) M-me? I’m Janus-s-s.

MIC-MIC	And why did you freeze, Janus-s-s?

JANUS	(stammering) I… I always freeze like this when I’m afraid.

MIC-MIC	What are you afraid of?

JANUS	Everything. And everyone!

MIC-MIC	Oh!

DUKE	Oh! Even us?

JANUS	You too. Especially you.

OSCAR	Really? Even me?

JANUS	Yes, even you. A little bit.

BABY	(crying >on-screen)

MIC-MIC	(reacts) (on) Oscar!

BABY	(crying >on-screen)

OSCAR	Aha. (singing La Cucaracha)

MIC-MIC	(reacts)

MIC-MIC	Duke!

DUKE	Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, we were camping (off) by the Limpopo river. (on) And a pack of hungry wolves attacked us. Oh mon Dieu, you can't imagine the howling! (off) Oh, the howling!

JANUS	(howl, sound)

BABY	(laugh)

MIC-MIC	Alright, time to leave. Janus, you're coming with us.

JANUS	(stammering) M-me?

MIC-MIC	Yes, you. What, you're too scared?

JANUS	I'm very scared. B-but staying here… (sigh) is even scarier.

MIC-MIC	Well, it's decided then. Come on. All aboard.

JANUS	(scared whimper, falls down)

DUKE	My dear friends, let me tell you (on) another story... This is a good one! We were right around these parts, me and my good friend Tiger...

MIC-MIC	Everyone knows, there are no tigers around here. Do you know what a blabber-mouth you are, Duke?

DUKE	Me? Blabber-mouth?

MIC-MIC/JANUS/OSCAR	Mhmm.

DUKE	I swear! There are tigers here!

AMUR	Hello, little Bee! Would you like to be my friend? I'm terribly lonely. I have no one to talk to.

BEE	(buzz)

AMUR	We can talk about weather or sports, if you like... Or maybe even… Oh, I’ve got an idea! We could write a poem together.

BEE	(buzz)

AMUR	The Bee or not the Bee, that is the question. Whether I stay and drink the water from a puddle or rush ahead? Whoever knows? Who can tell me was I born to bravely win them over as a courageous superhero!

BEE	(buzz)

AMUR	Is something wrong with me? Why doesn't anyone want to talk to me? Everybody has friends but me. (sigh)

DUKE	I have another story to tell. (on) One day, I was sailing down the Zambezi river, and suddenly I ended up in very thick fog.

MIC-MIC	Hold on a sec, Duke. What’s this noise? I thought I heard something.

DUKE	Noise? Wasn't me. Oh, look!

MIC-MIC	(sounds, swallows) Remind me, Duke, what exactly were you saying about the fog?

DUKE	Oh, yeah... That's right. When we were out of the fog…

OSCAR	There! Watch out!

JANUS	(falls down)

MIC-MIC	(reacts, screaming )

DUKE	(screaming)


MIC-MIC	(reacts)

DUKE	(screaming)

MIC-MIC	(grunting)

OSCAR	(scared sounds)

DUKE	(screaming)

MIC-MIC	(effort) Duke, grab the baby and fly away!

DUKE	Aye, aye, captain! Taking off now! (sounds) What about you?

MIC-MIC	Don't worry about us! We are doomed!

JANUS	Yes, we are doomed. (sound)

DUKE	Maybe not! I see a shore ahead. You can try to pull in there.

MIC-MIC	(grunt)

OSCAR	(sounds)

MIC-MIC	Oscar!

OSCAR	Why always me? (sound)

MIC-MIC	Steer the raft to that shore. And I will be (off) rowing.

OSCAR	(sounds)

MIC-MIC	Oscar!

DUKE	We can't sail any further. Too many rocks!

MIC-MIC	I knew I shouldn’t have taken you on board you are nothing but trouble! A hare on board is always bad luck.

OSCAR	What? You think, I am bad luck? You were the one steering the raft!

MIC-MIC	Oh, so this is my fault now?

OSCAR	It’s not mine!

MIC-MIC	And you all agree?

JANUS	(falls down)

DUKE	(sounds)

MIC-MIC	Alright! Super duper! Well, I don't need you anymore. You guys can all go home now. Hope you won't get lost on your way, because I won't be there to be blamed for it.

BABY	(crying >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	(reacts) Oscar, dance now!

OSCAR	Uh-uh.

MIC-MIC	Alright then. Duke!

DUKE	Uh-uh.

MIC-MIC	Janus!

MIC-MIC	Well, fine, I’ll handle it myself!

MIC-MIC	Hm. (short laugh) Aha…(singing La Cucaracha)

BABY	(crying >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	Okay, okay. Shh! Hush!

MIC-MIC	Let me tell you a story. So, I decided to visit a friend, who also happens to be a bee... (off) But then a Badger showed up. And he said, (on) "Your bee friend is not even a bee. She is actually a wasp!" What do you think of that?

BABY	(crying)

MIC-MIC	(crying, howling)

BABY	(crying >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	(falls down)

AMUR	(on) Hello, my dear friends!

MIC-MIC	Who are you? An oversized bee? Then buzz outta here!

AMUR	I dreamed of sailing away. I even found a perfect way. But where am I headed? Out there, under a dark sky, No one is waiting for me. I can hear a baby cry. Maybe, it's crying for me.

BABY	(laugh >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	So, do you have a name, Shakespeare?

AMUR	Uh, William. Ah… I mean Amur.

MIC-MIC	Well, Amur… Bonjour! I'm on a quest of finding this baby panda's parents. You want to tag along?

AMUR	Of course. Looks like I've finally found a friend.

MIC-MIC	Not again! What have I ever done to you?

AMUR	You saved me from myself…

MIC-MIC	Alright, Lord Byron, that's enough. Time to get moving! To the south!

MIC-MIC	Well, what are you waiting for? Come on.

DUKE	(sounds)

DUKE	(coughing >on-screen, heavy breathing)

DUKE	(heavy breathing)

DUKE	(heavy breathing, efforts, fall down)

DUKE	Here it is, my friends. (on) The Great Wall of China. It is 16 feet thick and measure’s whole 30 feet tall my friends. And you can see the thing from outer space!

OSCAR	Duke, how you do know all this?

DUKE	How do I know? I was elder statesman to the Chinese Emperor during the Ming…

MIC-MIC	That's perfect, Duke. Then you should know the best way for us to get to the other side of the wall.

DUKE	Well… We birds, we usually just fly over obstacles. Like this.

MIC-MIC	Thank you, Duke, that really helped. But wait … I could just throw you guys over it!

OSCAR	(nervous laugh) Are you kidding? We'll break our necks.

DUKE	Like in a circus…

MIC-MIC	Brilliant, like in a circus!

DUKE	Woo-hoo!

OSCAR	(no sound) Got it!

JANUS	(falls down)

MIC-MIC	Hm. (short laugh, effort)

JANUS	(screaming >slow motion)

MIC-MIC	(effort)

AMUR	Hold on, Mic-Mic. Who will throw you over the Wall?

MIC-MIC	Hmm. You've got a point there, Homer.

DUKE	Well let me finish my story. In the circus, in a world famous team of pelican-gymnasts we used to use a catapult to jump over each other. Ta-da!

MIC-MIC	A catapult, eh? (grunt)

MIC-MIC	(grunt)

MIC-MIC	Huh? (sounds)

DUKE	Don't worry. You’ll get it next time.

MIC-MIC	Yeah, I'm not worried at all.

DUKE	(screaming, sounds)

MIC-MIC	Do not (on) let go! Steer with your wings! Use your wings!

MIC-MIC	(grunt) Huh? Hm! (grunting)

MIC-MIC	Okay…

DUKE	(screaming)

MIC-MIC	Duke, not so fast this time!

DUKE	Going down!

MIC-MIC	Use your wings to slow down or we'll have to start over!

DUKE	Okay!

MIC-MIC	Now drop the stone!

DUKE	I'm trying! (screaming)

MIC-MIC	(screaming, reacting)

OSCAR	Came down like a feather, Mic-Mic.

MIC-MIC	Phew. I say we take a rest.

BABY	(sounds)

OSCAR	(gasp) Look, everyone! Our baby is all grown up.

AMUR	Where’s he headed? He must have felt something.

DUKE	Little guy feels like he’s home at last.

MIC-MIC	(scoffs) You all are so sensitive. (sound)

MIC-MIC	(grunt, laugh)

ELEPHANTS	(trumpeting >on-screen)

MIC-MIC	(gasp) Huh? (grunting) (gasp)

JANUS	Whoa. So this is how my story ends. (falls down)

MIC-MIC/OSCAR/AMUR	(panting)

ELEPHANTS	(trumpeting)

MIC-MIC	Guys, we have to split up now!

OSCAR	Right! Left! Right! (off) (scream)

ELEPHANTS	(trumpeting)

MIC-MIC	Everybody freeze!

JANUS	Way ahead of you, boss.

ELEPHANTS	(trumpeting)

DUKE	What a dangerous place!

MIC-MIC	Alright. Now, let’s find a place to set up camp. Oscar, you will keep watch. Keep an eye on the baby in case he decides to run away.
OSCAR	Mhmm.

OSCAR	Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are. Baby panda go to sleep, May your dreams be kind and neat.
BABY	(babbling) Daddy!

OSCAR	(sigh) Me, daddy? Well, guess what, little guy? By this time tomorrow you'll finally be home with your real parents. (sigh)

PYTHON	I simply can't believe my luck. (laugh)

PYTHON	This is my chance for a perfect revenge on that muscle head. Just you wait. (laugh)

PYTHON	Hello there, little baby.

OSCAR	(humming a lullaby >on-screen, yawning)

MIC-MIC	(snoring) (sounds)

DUKE	(off)

MIC-MIC	(screaming >off-screen)

OSCAR	Mic-Mic, what are you screaming for?

MIC-MIC	What do you mean? I thought we were...that we are, you know, sinking!

OSCAR	Why sinking? What are you talking about?We are in the desert!

MIC-MIC	What? In a desert?

OSCAR	Besides, we are unsinkable, you and I! I mean I’m your son.

MIC-MIC	You are my son?

OSCAR	Of course, I am. How could you forget?

AMUR/DUKE/JANUS	And us too.

MIC-MIC	And you?

DUKE	Obviously.

DUKE/JANUS/AMUR	How could you forget, Mic-Mic?

ELEPHANTS/HOUSTON/STEVIE RAY/BENNY	How could you forget?

MIC-MIC	Wait, you too, Houston?

HOUSTON	Of course, I am. How could you forget?

ELEPHANTS/HOUSTON/STEVIE RAY/BENNY	How could you forget?

MIC-MIC	Uh... (swallows)

ELEPHANTS/HOUSTON/STEVIE RAY/BENNY	Daddy!

ELEPHANTS/HOUSTON/STEVIE RAY/BENNY	Daddy!

MIC-MIC	(sound)

ELEPHANTS/HOUSTON	Daddy!

STEVIE RAY/BENNY/MIC-MIC	(gasp, sounds)

ELEPHANTS/HOUSTON/STEVIE RAY/BENNY	Daddy!

MIC-MIC	(screaming)

MIC-MIC	(screaming, sounds, breathing)

OSCAR	Daddy! Daddy! (off) (56:19) Daddy! (on) Daddy! Daddy!

MIC-MIC	Whew. It’s that nightmare again, that we both share.

MIC-MIC	(no sound) Oscar!

OSCAR/AMUR/JANUS	(react)

MIC-MIC	Oscar! Where is the baby? (off) (sounds)

OSCAR/AMUR/JANUS	(react)

OSCAR	I’ll be right back. Baby! Baby! Baby!/ Where are you?

OSCAR	Baby!/ Baby.

MIC-MIC	I wish you went missing, not the baby! You were supposed to be watching him! (off)

OSCAR	It's all the elephants' fault. If it wasn't for them…

MIC-MIC	The elephants?

DUKE	Mic-Mic, it’s your fault. You should have known Oscar cannot be trusted with a baby!

MIC-MIC	My fault? And where have you been? Instead of watching Oscar who should have been watching the baby, you slept like a log. You know who else sleeps like a log? Lazy Thanksgiving turkeys, that’s who!

DUKE	Excuse me? (breathing) You're calling me a turkey?/ Well, now I’m mad! Now I’m really mad! Last time I was this mad, I... um... well I can’t remember one story, that’s how mad I am.

AMUR	Please, don't fight, my friends. How is this going to help the baby panda?

MIC-MIC	Well, look who’s purring here! Our little poet!

AMUR	Hm? Hm? Hm.

MIC-MIC	I've had it with all of you! That's it! I am leaving! Ciao.

OSCAR	Who does he think he is? He's leaving? Well, I'm leaving too!


DUKE	Guys, you don’t have to be like that! Too bad. You were such a good audience for my stories... Sometimes.

JANUS	So what shall we do now?

AMUR	I guess, I will be heading home. What about you?

JANUS	M-me? Um... I'll just sit here, scared to death.

JANUS	(sounds, howl)

JANUS	That's it! I'm tired of being scared! I can't take it anymore. Alright… (whimper, sounds)

JANUS	Let's see… (sniffing) Who would leave such a long and wide track like that? A crocodile? (gasp) A crocodile!

JANUS	No. There would be footprints. Now, who else can it be? Maybe, a snake? (gasp) That would have to be a large snake. A very large snake. (falls down)

JANUS	This time it's legitimately scary.

FEAR	You are absolutely right. (on) It's horrifying. Anyone would be scared to death. I mean, just think about it. What could leave a trace like this? Well probably something that can swallow you in the blink of an eye.

JANUS	But I have to try and save the baby.

FEAR	Do you? Why on Earth would you do that? Let the others do the dirty work. By the way, where did your so-called friends go? There's nobody here.

JANUS	Uh-huh.

JANUS	(sigh) (on) (sigh)

MIC-MIC	(grunt) Well, that turned out just great. So much for reuniting a family. Ha-ha! So much for saving the day. Yeah, the story of my life! I tried my best, and you know the rest. (sigh)

MIC-MIC	Wait… What is wrong with me? There's still hope, I have to go back. Yes! I will find baby panda and I get him back to his family!

OSCAR	Why it’s always my fault? Go on, blame Oscar for everything! If something's wrong, it's always Oscar who did it. Extinct dinosaurs? Didn't you know? Oscar did it! What about the Ice Age? Of course it was me! Who else would it has been? Global warming? That was me too. Come on, blame me, blame me for everything! It’s all my fault.

OSCAR	Except… (sigh) This time, it really is my fault. (sniff) That baby loved me, he really trusted me, and what did I do… What kind a hare am I? (sigh) Well, I was the one who lost him, I'll be the one who finds.

DUKE	Duke, buddy, what in the world has happened to you? I don't recognize you. You want to run and hide from danger now? Are you running away? You want to sit up there at your warm nest, huh? No. Of course not! But everyone left! So what? (01:01:44) No, I'm not a pelican, I'm a donkey. I will save the baby! I will, and it will become my greatest story ever!

AMUR	Well, are you proud of yourself, tiger? You lost a little baby. You lost all your friends. You are the stuff of legend, my friend. You are true hero. No, this just won't do. The little panda counts on you. And you will save him, no matter what! (growl)

FEAR	Alright. (on) Don't try being a hero. You won't achieve much all by yourself. Time to run home with your tail between your legs. I'm surprised you made it this far, to be completely honest with you. Oh. You think you're so special because you found a track? Who do you think you are? K9? (01:02:39) Lets go back home, so we can live a wonderful safe life together like the true cowards we are.

JANUS	No. You do not exist, do you hear me? You are not real. Go away and leave me alone. Get away! Go away! Leave me alone! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! (off) (sounds)

MIC-MIC	Who are you fighting there, Janus?

JANUS	Nobody. Just practicing.

MIC-MIC	And what exactly are you practicing for?

OSCAR	(panting)

OSCAR	Wait, Mic-Mic. Listen up, guys. (panting) I… I wanna tell you…I…It’s all my fault.

MIC-MIC	Heh.What else is new?

AMUR	My dear friends, please, no fighting. (on) Hot temper will not solve anything. We need to work together if we want to save the baby.

MIC-MIC	(grunt) Hm.

AMUR	Hm.

JANUS	Hm.

DUKE	Whoo-hoo-hoo! We need to come up with a plan. Have I ever told you the story of the battle of Trafalgar?

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

MIC-MIC	Hm?

DUKE	Hm?

JANUS	Hm?

AMUR	Hm?

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

MIC-MIC	What? I'm not good at charades. What are you saying?

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

MIC-MIC	So, a hedgehog stretched and jumped into the ocean?

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

DUKE	(gasp) They tied a rope into a sailor's knot?

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds)

AMUR	The sun is finally out, and the waves are gone?

OSCAR	No. (on) They are trying to tell us that the baby was taken by a very large and very long snake.

JANUS	Yes, a very, very large snake. Huge.

MIC-MIC	What do you mean, a large snake? A python?

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	Do you have any idea where he might have taken the baby?

MONKEYS	(monkey sounds >off-screen)

MIC-MIC	Follow them!

BABY	(crying)

PYTHON	There's no need to cry. You won't taste as good, if you cry too much. Don't spoil the meat.

BABY	(crying)

PYTHON	Ah. Poor baby is hungry. Well, don't worry, dinner is almost ready...

PYTHON	And you have the honor of being the main course. (laugh)

DUKE, OSCAR	(laugh)

PYTHON	It sounds like we have company? Stay here, and don't you dare try to escape, little one (hissing)

OSCAR	Hey, Duke, is it true that (on) a footless, yellow earthworm lives here?

DUKE	Oh, yes. That’s right! He also goes by Speckled Frog.

OSCAR	Heh. Is he really as stupid as they say he is?

DUKE	Yes, and if there’re ever an Olympics for idiots, he would be the unrivaled champion.

DUKE, OSCAR	(laugh >off-screen)

PYTHON	You think that's funny? Alright then…

PYTHON	Hello there. (hissing)

MIC-MIC	It’s time! (grunt) (off) (panting)

JANUS	You go ahead! I’ll catch up with you soon!

PYTHON	(sounds, growl)

PYTHON	Now watch me closely. (off) Listen to me very carefully. (on) From now on, I am your master. (hiss) You will obey me and do exactly as I tell you.

MIC-MIC	Hey, you, David Blaine, you can stop with your magic tricks now, because no one is buying it. Hypnotize this!

PYTHON	(sounds)

MIC-MIC	(effort) Ow! (groan, sounds)

PYTHON	(sounds)

MIC-MIC	(screaming)

PYTHON	(hissing)

PYTHON	Oh, what's wrong, Mr. Tough Guy? Does your hand hurt? (hissing)

MIC-MIC	(sounds)

PYTHON	Don't worry, it will stop hurting. (sounds)

OSCAR	Hey, you, overstretched hot-dog. Let my friend go!

OSCAR	(screaming)

MIC-MIC	(screaming)

PYTHON	(hissing) Well, you asked for it long use.

AMUR	(roar)

PYTHON	(hissing) Look who’s there. A striped kitten. Well, wait. I'll get to you too. (hissing)

JANUS	(sounds)

AMUR	Finally, I found out (panting) That my friends are all around. There's a grumpy bear Who could try to keep it down (panting) (on) And a cheerful hare Who is funny like a clown. (panting) And there's a feathered storyteller With the largest beak. (panting)

DUKE	(laugh)

AMUR	And also there's a gentle wolf, Who's too scared to speak. (panting)

JANUS	(sounds)

FEAR	Janus, don’t even think about it (on) Are you seriously considering helping this stripy Shakespeare? Do not be a fool. Run away while you still can. Trust me, it is not your fight, Janus.

JANUS	(stammering) Stop it! I’ve had enough of you. You’re not even real.

FEAR	And this is where you're wrong, buddy. I am real, and you are not. You’re nothing but a reflection of me.

JANUS	No, I’m not! This is enough! I am done being scared, do you hear me? I am not afraid anymore! (sounds)

JANUS	Wow! I’m not Janus anymore. I’m Jackie Chanus!

AMUR	They always help me, without fail.

AMUR	Why don’t you get off my tail? (panting)


AMUR	(sounds)

AMUR	And I love them just the same. (off) (sounds >on-screen)

AMUR	(sounds)

PYTHON	(hissing, gasp)

JANUS	(sounds >off-screen)

PYTHON	(sounds)

PYTHON	Why don't we call it a draw?

MIC-MIC	Yeah, right. Dream on, buddy! No way!

PYTHON	Let me go right this second.

MIC-MIC	You want me to let you go? I can do that. (off) (efforts)

PYTHON	(screaming)

MIC-MIC	There! I let go!

DUKE	I found him! I saved our little guy!

MIC-MIC	Hey, little guy. Are you okay?

BABY	(babbles)

MIC-MIC	(sound) Well done, Duke, thank you. And you, Janus. You did good too. (off) We wouldn't have won, if it wasn't for you.

AMUR	Thanks for your help. We never could bit this firehose without you, pal.

JANUS	You know, I felt brave enough to jump in, only because Oscar and Amur showed me what bravery was.

MIC-MIC	By the way, where’s Oscar?

OSCAR	(moan) Mic-Mic? Where is the python?

MIC-MIC	Very far from here. Thank you, Oscar, you saved my life.

OSCAR	Oh, come on. What are talking about? Without all of you I’m a worthless half point.

DUKE	We are all winners. We won today because we worked together!

JANUS	It was the best day!

DUKE	And now, do you, guys, remember see me fly up over the python…

MIC-MIC	Well done. Hey, remember how you jumped on him, and called him an overstretched hot- dog?

AMUR	I even managed to write an epitaph about myself.

OSCAR/MIC- MIC/AMUR/JANUS/DUKE	(indistinct chatter)

MR PANDA	Where is that stork? We’ve been waiting such a long time now.

MRS PANDA	Yes. I am so worried.

MR PANDA	(sigh)

MRS PANDA	(sigh)

BABY	(babbling, laughing)

MRS PANDA	(gasp, sounds)

MR PANDA	Hm.

MRS PANDA	It’s him?

MR PANDA	(gasp)

MR PANDA	(sound)

BABY	(babbling, laughing)

MR PANDA	(gasp)

MRS PANDA	Oh my…

MIC-MIC/OSCAR	(heavy breathing)	

MRS PANDA	(gasp, laugh) Son! My baby! (sounds)

BABY	Mommy.

BABY	Daddy.

MR PANDA	Our son…

MRS PANDA	(sound)

MIC-MIC	Hm-hm. Alright So what's the plan now, guys?

DUKE	I think I’ll stay here for a while. You see, I finally have found my audience. They don't interrupt, they don't argue, they believe me! What else could I ask for? And besides, now I have a true story.

AMUR	I’m going to stay here, as well. And I'm going to write a greatest poem about our adventure.

JANUS	I'm going back to my pack. The elections are coming, and I want to run for the alpha-male.

MIC-MIC	Good luck then. Well, Oscar and I are going back to our forest.

OSCAR	Yeap. Time to go home. All right, little guy, give uncle Oscar a hug.

BABY	(babble) Oscar…

OSCAR	Our baby’s talking! Did you hear? He said my name.

BABY	Mic-Mic…

MIC-MIC	Huh? Well… You… Uhm… Make sure to come visit us when you grow up, alright? You can all come too, of course. We have a great forest. And loads of honey.

MR PANDA	Thank you. We’ll come visit sometime.

MRS PANDA	And you are always welcome here.

MR PANDA/MRS PANDA/DUKE/AMUR/JANUS Have a safe journey!

BABY	Oscar! Mic-Mic!

MIC-MIC	Ah, home, sweet home./ Whew, that was one big trip.

OSCAR	Uh... (sigh) Well, guess I'll be going then. It was nice traveling with you, Mic-Mic. (sigh)

MIC-MIC	Hey, Oscar.

OSCAR	Yeah? What?

MIC-MIC	Stay at my place for the night, and we'll start building you a new house tomorrow.

OSCAR	No kiddin’?

MIC-MIC	Well, of course. What are friends for?

OSCAR	We're friends? Are you sure?

MIC-MIC	There's no doubt about it.

MIC-MIC	(snoring) Ah! What is it? (sounds)

BABY 2	(crying)

MIC-MIC	Oscar!

OSCAR	What is it? Oh my!

MIC-MIC	(sounds, panting, sounds)

BABY 2	(babbling)

MIC-MIC	Oh, no! Not again!

OSCAR	Unbelievable! I guess we better quality ask the stork delivery service for a membership discount.

BABY 2	(crying)

MIC-MIC	(sounds)

MIC-MIC	(screaming)
