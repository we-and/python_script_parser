ISSIE	We will find them. I promise.

DAN	That’s Patrick Freeman, he’s the one running the internship.

NATASHA	Dad? What is this?

SAM	They’re planning to ship abroad. They’d need a whole second plant to do that, it’d have to be huge.

AMANDA	So they can’t do anything with to the land if the horses are there.

ISSIE	Rachel Marchetti, so she’s not Frankie Pines at all.

ISSIE	I’m gonna call the police.

FRANKIE	The herd’s only in New Zealand for another forty-five minutes and you have no phone or car.

ISSIE	I know where they are.

 ISSIE	They’re here aren’t they? But where?

CALEB	What’d you say?

DAN	I said are you ok London? Get in touch.

CAROLINE	I hope she does. Stel, what about the track app?

STELLA	Oh yeah, gimmee your phone.

FRANKIE	Naw, your boyfriend’s worried. Sweet. Hey, don’t worry.

STELLA	Issie?

DAN	Yeah, she said, don’t worry, I’m with Tom, we have a lead.

CALEB	Really?

CAROLINE	Great.

CAROLINE	What’s that?

MITCH	I wonder what Sam’s got to say for himself, the grub.

MITCH	Hang on, what the.

MITCH	Amanda. Really?

MITCH	What on earth?

AMANDA	Hexronn.

CAROLINE	Where are they going?

CALEB	I don’t like the look of this.

SAM	What are you playing at, Julia?

JULIA	Excuse me?

SAM	Well you’ve lied to me, and you’ve made me lie to everyone else.

JULIA	That’s on you, Sam. We said we’d create jobs for Kauri Point and we have done that.

SAM	Single use plastics were never on the agenda.

JULIA	So?

NATASHA	Plastic? Seriously? Ever heard of climate change? Plastic can take a thousand years to decompose, it’s contaminating our soil and water, and causing the extinction of hundreds of species.

JULIA	I love hearing how engaged young people are with the environment. Good for you. But you see, the thing is Hexronn is a global company with huge reach and it just was no longer viable to use glass.

NATASHA	But.

JULIA	Look, I was gonna show you this today anyway.

JULIA	I am pleased to tell you that Hexronn has chosen Kauri Point as the town best placed to build the biggest water bottling plant in the Southern Hemisphere.

SAM	So you want to decimate our forest to build this?

NATASHA	That is illegal.

JULIA	No, sweetie, we own the forest, the only thing that is illegal is disposing of a herd of wild horses, aye Sam.

NATASHA	Oh, Dad.

SAM	And I would do anything to take that back, look Julia, let’s sit down and we can work this out.

JULIA	I’m afraid it’s a little too late for that, the forest is being cleared right now.

SAM	You can’t do that.

NATASHA	No.

JULIA	I can and I am.

SAM	Well, I’m not gonna be a part of this.

JULIA	Is that your resignation? Suit yourself.

NATASHA	I put chewing gum under your desk.

DAN	Oh, this isn’t good.

DAN	They’re gonna bulldoze the trees.

CAROLINE	Caleb, what are you doing?

CALEB	Go on then. You want it? Come and get it. Knock me down. Come on.

DAN	Is he alright? He looks like he’s gone rogue.

 CAROLINE	Yes, I’ve seen it once before, we were six and I dropped his microscope.

BULLDOZER DRIVER	Oi, move. 

STELLA	But, it’s working.

BULLDOZER DRIVER	Get out of the way.

DAN	Nice one. Come on, let’s get in front of the others.

CAROLINE	Cool, so we can just stand here, they can’t just drive over us.

DAN	Yeah, but how long can we hold them off? It’s just the four of us.

STELLA	Stella, get in front of that tree.

ADAM	Ninety per cent of the horses. Listen… No…

FRANKIE	Why not?

ADAM	Because you said she was gonna be sold separately, because the girl tamed her right? and it’s fast.

ISSIE	Blaze?

FRANKIE	Yeah, but she’s been shipped with the others you idiot. It’s all in here. Issie reaches into Frankie’s car, grabs her phone and hides again before Frankie opens the other side of the car. Frankie grabs a bag of documents and thrusts them at Adam.

CORRINE	Heather. Any moments that made you laugh or cry in Agatha’s Wheel?

KENNY	Do you have to do this here?

HEATHER	Oh, for me it was Devon’s wedding.

TIPENE	Oh, I loved him.

MIRIAMA	Devon got married?

HEATHER	Mmm.

CORRINE	Was he the one in prison?

HEATHER	No, that was the Tasmanian sheep farmer. Wasn’t it?

KENNY	Have any of you actually read this book?

SAM	Hey, ah, sorry to disturb you folks, but, we need a talk, Hexronn are moving in on the forest.

TIPENE	What? Kia tikara?

SAM	Right now. They’re gonna destroy it all. They want to build a second bottling plant there.

MIRIAMA	Slow down Sam, don’t you work for Hexronn?

SAM	No, no, not anymore.

TIPENE	They can’t just knock down the forest.

SAM	They can, they own it.

EVERYBODY	Aye?

SAM	After they bought Fantail, they bought out the forest, they said it was just to test for water sources, but they lied to me.

CORRINE	Looks like you dropped us in it, Sam.

SAM	Look, I.

HEATHER	Yeah, how could you do that?

TIPENE	Yeah, how could you?

NATASHA	This isn’t getting us anywhere, well we can sit here and blame my Dad, or we could do something to stop Hexronn before it’s too late.

HEATHER	Do what?

NATASHA	Stand up to them.

CORRINE	They’re not gonna listen to us love.

NATASHA	We have to make them. The factory they’re building is going to be huge. It’ll redefine Kauri Point, do we really want to be that town? With the enormous, polluting, water stealing, plastic bottle plant?

KENNY	Well, that’s a no.

MIRIAMA	It can’t be that bad, if it was, it wouldn’t be allowed.

HEATHER	Someone would stop it.

NATASHA	Yes. Us. This is our forest and our town, there is no one else. If you think we’ve already lost, then fine, sit here and enjoy your flat whites But I’m not willing to just give up, and let them take our forest. Because, that’s what will happen if we just, look the other way. It’s now, or never. We need to do something before it’s too late.

SAM	I couldn’t be prouder of you right now.

ISSIE	Marchetti.

ISSIE	I think I found the herd. I’m gonna try and bring them home.

ISSIE	Come on. Come on.

ISSIE	Blaze. Let go of her.

ADAM	What are you doing here?

ISSIE	I’ve come to get the herd.

ADAM	You really like to make life difficult for yourself, don’t you?

ISSIE	They’re wild horses, you have no right.

ADAM	Just get out of here.

ISSIE	They’re in there, aren’t they?

ADAM	Don’t. Unless you fancy being shipped to Australia with them.

ADAM	Stupid kid.

FRANKIE	Adam?

ADAM	Get back, get back, get down, no, ahhh.

FRANKIE	Hey, ahhh.

MITCH	So cars just fill themselves up with petrol in London, do they?

AMANDA	Mum, stop going on about it.

SAM	You ok? Where you headed?

AMANDA	To find you.

MITCH	We’ve seen the statute Sam, we know what you did.

AMANDA	How could you do it? Steal a whole herd of wild horses, just because they were inconvenient for your business deal.

SAM	It was a terrible mistake. But I had to.

MITCH	Go on.

SAM	Hexronn wanted all the land around the plant, including the forest, just water sources they said, and then they found the horses and they were gonna pull the whole deal, and I panicked. I got Adam to…

AMANDA	Where are the horses now?

SAM	Adam’s not answering his phone. But as far as I know, they’re gone, they were shipped out of the country. Look, jobs were on the line.

MITCH	Your deal was on the line.

SAM	Yeah. Ok, both.

NATASHA	He knows he’s messed up, ok. He quit Hexronn. Look they’re knocking down the forest right now.

MITCH	They’re what?

NATASHA	Please, we need to go. Come with us.

DAN	Do you think they’re gonna move in anyway?

CAROLINE	What do we do?

DAN	Look.

MITCH	Alright, that’s the way to do it kids.

NATASHA	Wow, good one guys.

CAROLINE	Do you know what’s going on?

NATASHA	They’re building a second plant here.

DAN	They can’t do that.

STELLA & CAROLINE	What? No.

AMANDA	Where’s Issie?

DAN	With Tom.

MITCH	Right, come on you lot.

MITCH	Roll over this, bozo.


AMANDA	Mum, be careful.

MITCH	Where’s the girl who jumped off the garage roof with a pair of pants and a table cloth?

AMANDA	Yeah, I was seven, and I wanted to be Wonder Woman, anyway, it’s not important.

MITCH	Ah ha.

DAN	Guys, there’s still not enough of us.

NATASHA	Dad, they came.

MIRIAMA	I was so glad when you’re Dad got that job, but it’s not worth this. You were right son.

TIPENE	Yeah, ka pai you, Daniel.

MITCH	Come on Ken, have a sit down.

KENNY	My suit’s dry clean only. Oh, what the hey, ho. Principles are principles. 

KENNY	This will be good for the website. Hey Corinne, take a photo.

CORRINE	Bit busy right now, Ken.

EVERYBODY	Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. 

CALEB	This is amazing.

CAROLINE	Yeah, where’s Issie and Tom. They should be here.

TOM	Kia ora. Yeah. I’m his sponsor. Really? That’s great. Nah, he’s gonna be so thrilled. And you won’t regret it, he’s a good kid. Awesome. Ok, great, bye.

TOM	Chief. Have you traced him yet?

POLICE OFFICER	Ah, we’re looking into it.

TOM	Right, well it’s urgent aye. These horses could be shipped out of the country at any minute.

TOM	I wish these things were never invented.

TOM	Ok, look, I’ve gotta go. If you find anything, could you tell me?

POLICE OFFICER	Of course.

EVERYBODY	Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. Go home Hexronn. 

JULIA	You’re in charge.

JAKE	Sweet. Do I get a pay rise?

JULIA	Get it done.

JAKE	Right, go on lads.

DAN	Dad, Dad, Dad.

MIRIAMA	Jake now.

JAKE	Look, it’s just my job, son.

DAN	You can’t.

JAKE	It’s just the way it is, ok?

DAN	That’s not good enough. Look at what you’re cutting down.

JAKE	Yeah, yeah, it’s a tree, so what?

DAN	Look around Dan, these trees took hundreds of years to grow, and they won’t come back in our lifetime. This is wrong, and you know it.

JAKE	I just work for Hexronn, ok, I’m not responsible for their decisions.

DAN	No, but what you do counts. We have to protect these trees, like they protect us.

MIRIAMA	Well said Daniel.

DAN	Please, I’m just asking you, to stand up for what’s right, for once.

JAKE	I think that’s a tea break. Don’t you lads?

JULIA	Wait, wait, wait. For how long?

JAKE	Oh, difficult to say, really. Think I’ll take mine over there.

JULIA	You take one more step and you will never work for Hexronn again.

MIRIAMA	Frustrating isn’t it? He never listens to me either.

JULIA	You can’t stop this. Hexronn owns this forest, and all of you employees are in breach of your contracts. The rest of you, trespassing.

JULIA	I’d like to report some illegal action taking place on private property.

TOM	Look at you, Kauri Point. You having fun?

MITCH	Lie down and join us, Tom.

AMANDA	Where’s Issie, is she with you.

TOM	No, I haven’t seen her all day.

AMANDA	I thought you said she was with Tom.

CALEB	She said she was, she texted.

DAN	Look, here.

DAN	Wait, there’s another one. I think I found the herd and I’m gonna try and bring them home.

NATASHA	What?

CALEB	She’s found the Kauri Point Herd?

MITCH	If she has found the herd and she brings them here, Hexronn will have to stop.

CALEB	Why?

AMANDA	They’re protected. There’s a statute.

MITCH	Aye, Sam.

SAM	Yes, the forest is protected, as long as the horses are here.

CAROLINE	So, Issie could save the forest?

AMANDA	Yeah, but where is she?

STELLA	Hey, the tracking app.

NATASHA	Yeah, we could track her on our phone.

CAROLINE	Oh, I’ve got her.

AMANDA	Oh, thank goodness.

CAROLINE	She’s moving, really fast. Maybe she’s in a car?

TOM	Nah, that’s in the bush, you’d never get a car through there. I think maybe she’s riding.

DAN	Do you think she’s got the herd with her?

AMANDA	What? What is it?

TOM	Well ah, where she’s headed, it’s um, it’s a bit tricky. So I would like to ah, go and meet her, just to help her, you know. Um, but I’m gonna have to go, cross country, if I’m gonna make it on time.

AMANDA	And that’s ok?

TOM	Yeah, yeah, it’s all good.

TOM	You come with me. The way Issie’s going, she’s gonna have to cut across Laurieston farm.

CAROLINE	She’s gonna hit the cattle grid?

AMANDA	Maybe I should come with you.

TOM	No, we’re gonna ride, you stay. Ok. Trust me.

AMANDA	Ok.

CAROLINE	Are we gonna make it?

TOM	We have to.

DAN	Tom’s gonna ride?

CALEB	It sounded like it.

AMANDA	What’s the deal with that?

MITCH	He hasn’t ridden in over ten years. He was in a pretty bad accident.

NATASHA	The horse died. He was in a coma. When he woke, he swore he’d never ride again.

POLICEWOMAN	This, is an illegal protest. Leave this forest with immediate effect, or you’ll be arrested for trespassing.

MITCH	We’re not moving.

POLICEWOMAN	This is your final warning. Step away from the trees immediately.

DAN	We have the Kauri Point Herd.

JULIA	Really? Where are they?

NATASHA	They’re coming. Issie’s bringing them. We know this forest is protected.

KENNY	Is it?

STELLA	So you have to stop.

JULIA	I don’t see any horses. What I do see is the Police. But the choice is yours.

CAROLINE	If she’s got the herd, they’ll break their legs.

TOM	Quick. Drag this over the grid.

POLICEMAN	Ok, start bringing them into the station.

KENNY	I’m sorry. I can’t do jail time. I’m the Mayor.

HEATHER	I’m sorry love. But I can’t risk it either, not with you kids.

STELLA	Mum.

CORRINE	Come on love.

CALEB	We just have to wait a bit longer.

NATASHA	Please.

MITCH	Oh, no you don’t.

CALEB	Wait, will you? Please. My bike.

CAROLINE	Tom, hurry, she’ll be here any second.

MITCH	This forest is protected.

POLICEWOMAN	We have no choice but to arrest.

MITCH	Go home, Hexronn.

DAN	She’s here. Issie’s here.

JULIA	What is she doing?

NATASHA	She’s bringing them home.

AMANDA	That’s your granddaughter.

MITCH	And your daughter.

DAN	You did it London, she can’t touch the forest now.

ISSIE	I guess you were right. Girls like me always find a way to make trouble.

JULIA	Shut it down.

FRANKIE	It’s Dad.

ADAM	What are you gonna tell him?

FRANKIE	The truth. That you messed up.

ADAM	I didn’t mess up.

ADAM	Oh no.

FRANKIE	Fantastic.

ISSIE	Here you go then. Home. I’m really gonna miss you.

TOM	Come on kids. Let’s go.

TOM	How would you, like to go to Australia?

DAN	What?

TOM	Your Patrick Freeman called. You got the internship. Well done, son.

DAN	But, I thought.

TOM	Yeah, he changed his mind, he thought you were impressive and I said, he’s a waste of space, but, he didn’t want to listen.

CAROLINE	Send us photos, yeah?

DAN	Yeah. Loads of photos of gory horse operations.

CALEB	Just the opera house would be fine.

STELLA	Or an emu.

NATASHA	Don’t kill any horses.

DAN	I’ll do my best.

ISSIE	Hey.

DAN	Oh, hey. I was just gonna come and find you. I’m about to go. I’ve written up a list of the supplements for you.

ISSIE	Yes, stop stressing. You’ve been telling me this for two weeks.

DAN	I’m really glad that you came to KP.

ISSIE	Me too.

TOM	Are you ready?

DAN	Yeah, sure, coming. Thanks for covering for me London.

ISSIE	Sure.

DAN	Just try not to lose me my job though.

ISSIE	Hey, it may take your lazy butt all day to feed a few horses.

DAN	I’ll see you when I come back.

ISSIE	Yeah.

MITCH	Want some sparkling water?

AMANDA	Fantail? Really mum? I thought Sam was the Devil.

MITCH	Oh, give him a break.

AMANDA	What?

MITCH	He’s doing his best. Got rid of Hexronn, done right by the workers. You know, he’s quite a sensitive chap.

AMANDA	How do you not get whip lash changing direction that quick mum? Where are you off to?

ISSIE	Ah, stables.

AMANDA	What? Now?

ISSIE	Tom texted, apparently I didn’t clean the water trough.

AMANDA	No. I’m sorry, but.

ISSIE	It’s fine mum.

AMANDA	No, Issie, it is not fine. I’m gonna have words with that man. Come on.

TOM	Go on then.

AMANDA	Look, is this really necessary?

AMANDA	Excuse me.

ISSIE	What’s she doing here?

TOM	Well she didn’t come back for me.
