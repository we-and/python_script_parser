??	So?  

??	I can't tonight, Kris.

??	Yes, you can.

??	All right, maybe I can.

??	Michael, I have to go.

??	So?

??	Come on! Seriously?

??	Just come right back.

??	Michael, it's Saturday.

??	They don't need you  in the office.

??	I just have to make sure  the file I was working on  last night gets sent.

??	What time  did you come home  last night?

??	Late.

??	You were snoring so cutely  I didn't want to wake you up.

??	You should've.  I was waiting up for you.

??	Reading a sexy book.

??	Really?  Yeah.

??	Tell me more  about this book.

??	Oh, you know,  it was kind of...

??	a "you had to be there"  kind of thing.

??	You know, no one's probably  even in the office  in England.

??	They take weekends  over there, you know.

??	Something  you should consider.

??	This is me taking a weekend.

??	Come here.  No.

??	Come here.

??	Yeah.   

??	Yeah.

??	I gotta check an e-mail.  No way.

??	Thanks for the coffee.

??	I feel like we need to get away.

??	What do you mean, get away?  Get away from what?

??	Away from work.

??	Like normal people do  on the weekends?
	
??	They get away.

??	I was just checking out--

??	You know,  I wish I got checked out  as much as your e-mail does.

??	Come on, hon,  you know I think  you're incredibly hot.

??	Sure, when you remember  that I'm here.
	
??	That's not fair.

??	So the new guy at work told me  about this bed-and-breakfast  that's in the hills,

??	and I guess him and his wife  go pretty often...

??	when they need  to reconnect.  New guy?

??	Oh, seriously?

??	He just moved over from Axis,  and I've been training him.

??	He's a nice guy.

??	Listen, you don't need  to be talking to the new guy  about us, okay?

??	We're fine.

??	Did you not hear anything  I just said?

??	We're not fine.

??	Hey.

??	What's the name of that place?  Wow.  Place better  have Internet.

??	Or what? You'll leave?

??	Why don't you  just get in the car  and go home right now, Michael? I'm sorry.  My mind's going  a million miles an hour...

??	wrapped around  this work thing.

??	I'm here for you  this weekend.

??	I promise.   

??	Hi! You must be  Michael and Annie.  I'm Serena Milton.

??	My husband Max is in town  picking up some wine and cheese  for tonight.

??	I hope you'll join us.

??	That sounds excellent  actually.  Wonderful. So there's another couple  staying here this weekend...

??	but we have  our private apartment  in the back,

??	so the four of you  basically have  full run of the house.

??	Kristen and Todd  just arrived as well,

??	so I'll introduce you  when they come down.

??	In the meantime,  can I give you a tour?

??	Uh, Todd Jackson?

??	And his wife Kristen.  They're regulars here.

??	Do you know Todd?

??	Um, he's actually the one  who introduced  Holly Hill to us.

??	Oh.  Oh, the new guy.

??	Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We're not staying.

??	Oh, come on, Michael.  We're already here,  and you don't even know the guy.

??	Oh, hey. You guys must be  our last-minute reservations.

??	How you doin'?  I'm Max Barrons.

??	I hop you guys  like olives and Dutch cheeses,

??	'cause I think I bought  the whole store out.

??	How you doin', man?  I'm Michael.  Nice to meet you.

??	This is Annie.  You need a hand  with the bags?

??	Oh, no, thanks.  That's okay.

??	I'm just gonna kiss my wife  and get these things  into the kitchen.

??	That is the sexiest man  I've ever met.

??	How long have you two  been together?

??	Ten years actually.  We grew up next door  to each other.

??	That's a long time.  Yeah.

??	Marry your best friend  and keep an open mind.

??	That's the key.  Speaking of keys,  here's the key to your room.

??	It's down the hallway,  first door to your right.

??	Wine and cheese  will be out around :  this evening.

??	And otherwise,  make yourself at home.

??	I'm gonna give my husband  a proper thank-you  for running the errands today.

??	You do that.

??	Hey.  How are they?

??	It's hard to tell.

??	He seems wound  kind of tight,

??	and I think it was  her idea to come here.

??	Ooh. She said that Todd's  the one that recommended us  to them.

??	Really.  Do they play together?

??	Based on his reaction,  I would say no.

??	You know, I didn't see Todd  and Kristen come in.

??	How are they doin'?

??	I'm not sure.

??	Something seemed  kind of off with them.

??	Well, you know,  it's gonna be  an interesting weekend then.

??	Mmm.

??	You wanna play with me  before we enter the arena?  Mmm.

??	I don't know.  Do I need to mark  my territory...

??	before you get involved  in all these people's drama?

??	You think you can mark me?  I like to see you try.

??	Oh, yeah?  Come here, woman.  [ Squeals ]

??	Yes!

??	You wear  too much clothing.

??	Yeah.

??	What do you think  you're doing?

??	Do you wanna mess with me?  Yeah.

??	Good.

??	That's exactly what  I wanted.

??	Come here, you.  Mmm.

??	Hey, you think  they can hear us?

??	I hope.

??	Oh, baby.

??	You dirty little sex toy.

??	Oh, shit!

??	Oh, God. Oh, God.  Oh, God. Oh, God.

??	Annie!  Have you met Kristen?

??	I haven't.  Hi. I work with Todd  at Codex.

??	Hi. He didn't mention anything  about arranging for other people  this weekend.

??	Oh, Todd doesn't know  we're here. We just--

??	He had mentioned it  as a place you guys  like to come to reconnect,

??	and so here we are.

??	Oh, this is  my husband Michael.

??	You okay, honey?  You look a little pale.

??	Yeah, I'm fine.

??	Fine. I just had a few  too many liquids,  that's all.

??	Hi, Michael.

??	Nice to meet you, Kristen.

??	Annie from Codex.

??	Oh, Todd.  I swear we didn't know  you guys were gonna be here,

??	or we wouldn't have horned in  on your weekend.

??	Oh, no.  Everything happens for a reason.  I'm glad you're here.

??	You'll really  like this place.

??	Todd Jackson.  Michael Murphy.

??	Good to meet you, Mike.  - Yeah, it's Michael.

??	Ah. So you're  getting to know Kris?

??	That's good.  Think you guys  would make good friends.

??	Hello.

??	I'm sorry about that.  I was hoping there'd be  no service up here.

??	I could have Max  turn off the "M" cell,  if you like.

??	You can do that?  - No, don't. I'm expectingsome important calls later.

??	So what do you do for work?

??	I manage  an office building downtown.

??	Oh. Do you manage  the Govern Building?

??	That's the one  that Michael's in.

??	Um, our firm  handles it, yes.

??	That's pretty impressive.

??	Must be a lot  with all those tenants  downtown nowadays.

??	Yeah, she's very close  with her clients.

??	That's why she gets  so many referrals.

??	Do you have to work  all the time too?

??	Um, it's-- it's up to me.

??	It just depends how much time  I invest in my clients.

??	I wish that was the case  with Michael.

??	I swear,  he's getting tumors nowadays...

??	from all the time he's spending  on his cell phone.

??	Speaking of cell phones,  not tumors.

??	I left mine in the room.

??	I'll be back.

??	Uh-oh. Send meto the cellars.  - [ Annie Laughs ]

??	Oh. Looks like everyone's  a red drinker tonight.

??	I'll be back with some more.

??	You're not lit up.  Excuse me?

??	There's no light  in your eyes.  

??	I don't even know  what you mean.

??	Well, I'm here  to turn the lights on.

??	That's my job tonight. 

??	Yeah, that account was supposed  to be closed days ago.

??	Get me the file tonight.  All right? Good-bye.

??	Hey. Would it have killed you  to admit you know me  from work?

??	What are you doing here?

??	You're on my turf.

??	Okay. What the hell  is your husband doing,

??	suggesting this place  to my wife?

??	How am I supposed to know?  I didn't even know  they knew each other.

??	And shut up.  They're gonna hear us.

??	What are you doing?  Shutting you up.Yeah. Yeah.

??	Is everything okay?

??	With me? Yeah.

??	With our guests--

??	I'm thinkin'  there's gonna be  some fireworks tonight.

??	Oh. Of what variety?

??	Explosive.

??	Mm.  Full of heat.

??	I'm not sure,  but I think that Kristen  and the new guy, Michael,

??	know each other--  but aren't saying.

??	Hmm. Fascinating.

??	And Todd and Michael's wife  work together, right?

??	Mm-hmm.

??	He seemed really intent  on talking to her.

??	That's why  I came out here.

??	So tell me.

??	Do any of our guests  intrigue you this weekend?

??	Kristen and Michael  just seem like a lot  of drama waiting to happen.

??	And I've been there  and done Todd.

??	So that just leaves Annie.

??	I just get the feeling  that she's kind of...

??	sleepwalking  through her relationship.

??	Kind of makes me wonder  what she'd be like...

??	if she woke up.

??	Mmm. Sounds interesting.

??	Think you'd let me watch?

??	Maybe.

??	But even if you don't,  you always get  the complete story...

??	with all the details.

??	Oh, but it's so much more fun  to watch.

??	I said we'll see.

??	You comin'?  Oh, I'm not  gonna miss this.

??	Refills, anyone?  Yeah.

??	So, Todd tells me  you two met  at a couples yoga retreat.

??	I'm surprised  he told you that.

??	He doesn't really tell that  to many people.

??	I can see why.

??	I'm having a little trouble  with the visual.

??	What? You can't picture me  wrapped around a woman  like a pretzel?

??	Well, maybe I'll have  to show you sometime.

??	What Todd didn't tell you,  I'm sure,

??	was that the main emphasis  of the retreat...

??	was on relating  to your partner.

??	Yoga was just the access  to heightened communication.

??	So is it something you guys  would ever try again?

??	It was definitely  an eye-opening experience  for all of us.

??	I hear a deep and meaningful  conversation coming on.

??	I think that's my cue.

??	Yeah, I think it's time  to go to the man cave.

??	What do you think?  Yeah.

??	You know wherewe're gonna be. 

??	How come they just bolted?

??	Pretty sure Todd  didn't want to see  the expression on your face...

??	when I told you  that the four of us...

??	ended up  having sex together  after that weekend.

??	Exactly.

??	Why?

??	Why did we get together,  or why didn't he want  to see your face?

??	Both.

??	Okay. Easy one first.

??	I think Todd's  attracted to you...

??	and he doesn't want  to scare you away.

??	But he's married.  And so are you.

??	Which leads me  to my second point.

??	One of the main things  we all got  from that retreat...

??	was the idea  that we use our bodies  to communicate...

??	all the time,  even when  we don't realize it.

??	Like body language.  Definitely that,

??	but there's also  this whole communication...

??	that happens with sex.

??	Okay, for example,

??	you know how men and women  use sex and love  differently?

??	Yeah.

??	Men get more offended  when a woman has sex, and women get more offended  when a man falls in love.  Right.

??	That's  the unspoken agreement  we seem to have.

??	But if you open up the lines  of communication...

??	and you explore physical  and emotional intimacy  with your partner... while----exploring   other people,

??	it just sort of forces  all those unspoken things  out into the open...

??	where they're less damaging  to a relationship.

??	Yeah, but me and Michael  don't really have a hard time  in our sex life though.

??	So connecting in bed  isn't your problem.

??	What about all  the other connections  that make a relationship strong?

??	Me not feeling like a priority  has nothing to do with sex.

??	Of course it does.

??	If the sex is fine  and Michael always has time  to connect physically,

??	it just shines a big light  on all the times...

??	he's not taking time  to connect emotionally.

??	Well-- Crap.

??	Exactly.

??	Hmm.

??	But seriously,  you're basically talking  about swinging, right?

??	Doesn't that conjure up images  of 's key games...

??	and naked  backyard pool parties?

??	Yeah. Exactly.

??	For us, it's more  about an open dialogue...

??	with each other.

??	It's just exploring  a physical side  of ourselves...that most people put a lid on  when they find their partner.

??	You guys  are still doing this.

??	What if I told you  that it totally turns me on...

??	that Todd's attracted to you? 

??	I think you'd have  to talk to my husband.

??	And what if I said I will?

??	What are you gonna say?

??	I'll tell him that he has  an incredibly intelligent,  sexy, interesting woman...

??	and he's cheating himself  out of all the best parts  of her.

??	How so?

??	He's taking you  for granted.

??	Sex has become separate  from everything else,

??	and it's  the "everything else"  part of sex...

??	that makes it  so amazing.

??	There's something  about really being seen...

??	that's such a turn-on.

??	Your skin is so soft.

??	Does he even  notice that anymore?  [ Scoffs ]

??	If he watched me  make love to you,

??	he'd be damn sure  to notice.

??	What would you do  if he was watching?

??	You're right though.

??	He's missing out  on a part of me, and it's affecting  our relationship. 

??	Deal is,  you tell him afterwards.

??	He's gonna hate that.  Yeah, maybe.

??	Or else your conscience  is gonna get in the way  of communication.

??	Looks like  we have an audience.  

??	Oh, my God.  

??	I'm so sorry, honey.  I got caught up  on this conference call...

??	with the one guy from London  that doesn't sleep,

??	and I just wanted  to get finished...

??	so I can spend  the rest of the time  with you.

??	We need to talk.

??	Okay.

??	I... made love  to someone else.

??	I knew we only came here  so you could fuck Todd.

??	What? No.  I didn't even know  he was gonna be here.

??	Hold on.  You don't understand.  No, no, no, no, no.

??	Even if I did believe you--  which I don't--

??	it doesn't  change the fact...

??	that you let someone else  put their fuckin' dick  inside you, does it?

??	Oh, my God.  Michael, calm down.

??	Let me finish.

??	If that's what you want,  fine.

??	Finished. See you.

??	That went well.

??	I know we sort of  put the brakes...

??	on playing around  with anybody else,  other than Serena and Max,

??	but I think  a little playtime  with Annie...

??	might be really good  for us.

??	Why? What's wrong  with keeping things  the way they are?

??	N-N-N--  Nothing's wrong.

??	I just wondered  what it would look like...

??	to see the two of you  together.

??	I thought we weren't  gonna have sex  with other people anymore, Todd.

??	I know. I know.

??	I was being  a really big jerk  about the other guys,

??	but I've been working  on that, babe.

??	Well, what if I wanted  to have sex with Michael?

??	How would you feel  about a full swap?

??	Okay.  No!

??	What? Why not? 

??	Because you said yes.  That means you're into her.

??	You asked me  a hypothetical question.

??	I gave you  a hypothetical answer.

??	You're just making  the other shit up.

??	It sounded pretty real to me.

??	Look, I don't know the chick,  and I definitely  don't know the guy.

??	But you're  the real one for me.

??	Annie?

??	You okay?

??	Fine.

??	You don't sound fine. 

??	Michael left.

??	Gone?

??	Car's gone.

??	I'll give you a ride  anywhere you want.

??	Actually, that's part  of the problem.

??	Michael thinks  you already did.

??	Bastard.  Yep.

??	I'm sorry.

??	Don't be.  You didn't do anything.

??	Not for the lack  of wanting to. 

??	Yeah. I heard about  your arrangement  with Serena and Max.

??	Prior experience tells me  that's not for me.

??	So, what is for you?

??	Partner. Best friend.

??	Michael and I met in college  and started building  a life together.

??	And then the job came in  and took over as priority.

??	Like Serena said,  good sex doesn't fill  all the holes in a relationship.

??	Truth?  Always.

??	You're the best thing  about going to work.

??	I spend a lot of time  figuring out ways  to make you laugh.

??	See?

??	You have  a really nice smile.

??	We're both married.

??	Yeah. There's that.

??	I have to go.  Hey.

??	I can't.  I want you.

??	I  can't.

??	I've been second in line  for too long,

??	and we're both...  married.

Michael	Come out and face me,  you bastard.

??	Get your ass out here  and face me like a man.

??	What the hell  is your problem, Murphy?

??	You're fuckin' my wife.  That's my problem.

??	Hey, guys! Come on, man.  This isn't the time  or place.

??	Dude, you need  to get your facts straight...

??	before you come busting in here,  waking everybody up  with your bullshit.

Michael	Do I?

??	She told me last night  you guys hooked up.

??	Michael, that's not  what I said.  You need to calm down.

??	You don't get to tell me  to calm down anymore.

??	You don't get to tell me  to do anything anymore.

??	You lost that  fuckin' privilege, bitch.

??	Now, hey.  Get yourself  under control, man.

??	Okay? Stay out of it, Max.

??	You been hittin' on my wife  since we got here.

??	Fuck, this entire house  has been your idea.

??	Did you two get together  to fuckin' plan this weekend...

??	to go fuckin'  underneath my nose?

??	You should have shut up  about five minutes ago, man.

??	What's the deal, asshole?

??	I've been fucking your wife  for two months  under both your noses.

 Annie	Michael!

??	Todd, no.

??	Happy now?

??	Feel more connected?

??	You're an asshole.

??	Serena said  there'd be fireworks.

??	I guess she was right.

??	Yeah.

??	I'm really sorry  about what happened  this morning.

??	I'm the one who's sorry.

??	I feel like  what happened last night...

??	was the catalyst  for what seems like...

??	a huge misunderstanding.

??	It's what he wanted  to hear, obviously.

??	At a certain point,  it didn't matter  what I said anymore.

??	How are you feeling?

??	Like I got hit with  the emotional equivalent  of a bus.

??	Where does it hurt?

??	My pride mostly.

??	Did Todd know  they were having  an affair?

??	No.

??	So it wasn't  some big swinger thing?

??	They didn't have  an open marriage, Annie.

??	When they played  with someone else,

??	it was always  with the other person's  complete permission...

??	and always  in the same room.

??	And, honestly,  Kristen and Todd...

??	stopped being intimate  with other people  a while ago...

??	because Todd  didn't like to share.

??	Really?

??	He's pretty much  a one-woman kinda guy.

??	But lately I've had the feeling  that he was with Kristen  more out of commitment...

??	than because he was  really happy.

??	Speaking of, Todd said  he would give you a ride  back to the city...

??	when you wanted to go.

??	Oh.

??	Thanks, but I'll probably  just call a taxi.

??	I don't think I could  be in the same car  with his wife.

??	Kristen left this morning...

??	with Michael.

??	Thank you, Serena.

??	I'm sorry things turned out  the way they did.

??	Don't be.

??	Everything happens  for a reason.

??	Nice right hook.

??	You okay?

??	I will be.

??	You?  Coding's gonna be a little tough  for a week or so. 

??	Well, maybe  I can be your hands...

??	while you don't  have yours.

??	Well, maybe I don't  want my hands back.

??	I told you  I don't share, right?  Yeah.

??	Been there and done that.

??	Doesn't work out too well.

??	You know, I'm sorry.  He doesn't deserve you.

??	No, he doesn't.

??	I do though.  Really?

??	I've been holding  a place for you  at the head of the line.

??	You know, I know a place.

??	Mmm.
