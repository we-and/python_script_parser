LAURA	It’s Tooth Fairy, actually. (chuckles)

PORN ACTRESS	Oh.  That’s a new one.  I like it!  Is that like an oral thing?

LAURA	Oral?  Sure.  So, what’s your “thing”?

PORN ACTRESS	I used to do solos exclusively, but the whole group thing pays more so, you know, got a car payment.

LAURA	I love solos.

PORN ACTRESS	Who doesn’t?  And you might as well get paid for it, right?

LAURA	Oh!  Oh.  (sighs)

KEVIN	We open on a child’s hand as it slowly, slowly reaches into the darkness for something and we can just make out her tiny, little frozen fingers as they grasp around a gun with a swastika on the handle.  It’s just a little girl and she has that look in her eyes, that look

WAITRESS	Are you ready to order?

KEVIN	Uh, no.  I’m actually-I’m still waiting for someone else.

WAITRESS	Okay.

KEVIN	I will take some more water, though. (slurps) Fill’er up.

ZACK	Get rid of the writer.  We’ll get some USC student to do the polish for scale.  For free.  Whatever.  Look, we’re looking for a new sci-fi tent pole, “Bourne Identity,” shit, sci-fi shit.  Flying cars.  No-no-no emaciated children, no Nazis, for Christ sakes!  Just call the agencies, get someone new, someone cheap.  (to Kevin) Jesus Christ, and oy vey, nice to meet you, Zack Steiner.

KEVIN	Kevin Adams.  It’s very

ZACK	That thrills me. 

KEVIN	(chuckles) 

ZACK	Go on.

KEVIN	Well, the year is twenty forty-three.

ZACK	Okay.

KEVIN	And our hero, uh, a woman, a cyborg, but she doesn’t know that because you know her-her memory’s been erased...
ZACK	Right.

KEVIN	…by the CIA.  She forgets, uh, but she is on the run from the government because she’s

ZACK	Sure, sure, wait, stop!  Is she a robot?  

KEVIN	Yeah.  Very life-like robot.  

ZACK	Life-like robot.  

ZACK	See, that’s important.  Life-like is-is actually key.  We don’t want, you know, we want “T” not “Short Circuit.”  Hang on a second.  I’m sorry.

KEVIN	Yeah, I get it, I get it.

ZACK	Hey, babe, I’m in a thing.  What? 

KEVIN	(slurps)

ZACK	Slow down, slow down, slow down.  She had a seizure?  Is it diarrhea or a seizure?  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, stay at Jimmy Choo.  I’ll be there in a minute.  (to Kevin) All right.  Dude, I’m really sorry to do this, I really gotta run.  It’s a thing with my dog.  I love it.  I love it.  Send it over first thing in the morning.

KEVIN	Yup, um

ZACK	And I’ll have my assistant take a look and we-we-we’re onto something here, though.  

KEVIN	Really?

ZACK	Yeah, yeah, we are.  Stay safe!

KEVIN	I-I could

ZACK	Thank you.  Hey.  Hey, sorry-I’m sorry.  What?

LAURA	Thank you, thank you, thank you.  You, you’re a lifesaver.  Okay, I’ll just, uh, stay here.  Okay, thank you.  Bye. 

BARISTA	So, the Prince is on his way?  

LAURA	(scoffs) Just the chambermaid.  

BARISTA	You poor thing.

LAURA	Can I make one more quick phone call?  Really quick?

BARISTA	Make it quick.

LAURA	Thank you.

BARISTA	Uh-huh.

MINDY	Hi!

LAURA	I’m so sorry.

MINDY	Yeah.  What inspired this little frock today?

LAURA	I look ridiculous.

MINDY	Look, no one is West Hollywood’s even gonna pay attention, though.  You’re good.  Let’s get some lattes, crazy.

LAURA	You will never believe what happened to me today. (sighs)

MINDY	What, you met some gorgeous man who wanted to defile you in your little petticoat?

LAURA	Funny you should mention that.  I almost met several.

MINDY	Do tell.

LAURA	Have you heard of “Hester’s Gang Bang Three”?

MINDY	Uh, no.  Sounds disturbing.

LAURA 	There will be a sequel.

MINDY	Okay, even more disturbing that you know that.  What were you doing today?

LAURA	There was a little switch-a-roo at the agency.  While I was in a waiting room full of hopeful Hesters, the other Laura Bloom, you know, the six-foot tall Double D version, was across town auditioning for my role as a tooth fairy.

MINDY	Okay, you need a new agent.

LAURA	Agent?  I need to change my name.  

MINDY	That, too.

BARISTA	Hey, what can I get you ladies?

MINDY	I want a skinny latte no sugar added soy.  What do you want?

LAURA	Um, what she’s having, no foam.  So, I take it your date went well.

MINDY	How do you know?

LAURA	Your dress looks just as good as it did last night.

MINDY	Look at how observant you are!  I’m really sorry that I didn’t call you and tell you I wasn’t coming home.

LAURA	Yeah.  I worry.

MINDY	I know, but I was with a cop, very safe.

LAURA	Where do you meet these guys?

MINDY	I told you.  I ran that red light last week in Hollywood?

LAURA	Okay, that is definitely considered bribing an officer.  

MINDY	A very handsome officer who let me get off.

LAURA	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I’m gonna pass on those details. 

MINDY	(giggles)

LAURA	(scoffs) I have completely given up on the fact that I’m gonna meet somebody in this city.  And I’m okay with that.  My grandmother said if you wanna find something you gotta stop looking for it.

MINDY	Now she has seven cats and her house smells like goulash.  

LAURA	Sometimes you say things that make me wanna to cry.

MINDY	(groans) I know.  But you know what else?

LAURA	What?

MINDY	I gotta pee.  Chin up!

KEVIN	Hey, man.  Yeah, Zack Steiner went great.  Pretty into it.  I’m, uh, actually really excited but, uh, I had an idea.  Um, you know, just for that final bit there where you see the, uh, oh!  Crap!  I, uh, I gotta get to this Bernstein meeting.  Can you actually call ahead and tell them, uh, I might be a little bit late?  Um, I didn’t realize what time it was.  I stopped, um, I just want to tweak that last.

BARISTA	Laura?

KEVIN	You know, the moment there at the end of the scene, you know, at the very end?  I just wanna tweak that and see if we could just really, I don’t know, I think we can make a little bit something more out of that.  What-what do they want me to pitch exactly?  I mean do they want the pilot?  I could do-I could do the, uh, a pilot that I’ve been working

LAURA	(gasps) 

KEVIN	(shouts) Ow!  Ah!

LAURA	Oh, my God.

KEVIN	Ah-ah-ah!

LAURA	Oh, my God, I’m so sorry.  

KEVIN	Oh, Jen, I’ll call you back.  (to self) Ow.  Oooh!  Ah!

LAURA	God, um, uh, here let me-let me.  

KEVIN	(hissing) Okay.

LAURA	I’m sorry.  It’s my dress.  I should have hemmed it.  I’m such a klutz.

KEVIN	No, no, no, no, no.  Stop, what are you doing?  Get it off the skin.  

LAURA	This will come out.

KEVIN	Ah-ah!  Just stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!  It’s-it’s-it’s ruined.

LAURA	Baking soda.  Maybe, uh, I’ll see if they have some-have it. 

KEVIN	No, no, no, no, no, no.  It’s fine.  It’s-it’s-it’s don’t-don’t worry about it.  Ju-just it’s fine.

LAURA	Oh.

KEVIN	Oh.  It’s just, (exhales) it’s just hot.  (exhales).  

LAURA	Are you gonna have time to change before your meeting?

KEVIN	No, not really.

LAURA	I’m so sorry.

KEVIN	Eh.  It’s just my luck anyways.  

LAURA	(exhales) 

KEVIN	Wait.  How… were you eavesdropping on my conversation?

LAURA	You were a little loud.

KEVIN	Well, um, I’m glad you’re up to speed.  So, I’m guessing you were going to a Renaissance fair?  

LAURA	An audition. (sighs).

KEVIN	Actress?

LAURA	Actress.

KEVIN	It’s okay.  Um, I gotta, yeah.  Careful with, um, hot beverages.

LAURA	Will do.  Good luck on your meeting.

KEVIN	Bye, now.

LAURA	Bye.

TOOTH FAIRY	Who said a tooth fairy can’t have a sweet tooth?  Mmm.  Sparkle Zest let’s me eat all the candy I want, and I don’t have to worry about cavities.  

LAURA	Yeah, you do.

TOOTH FAIRY	Sparkle Zest is the best!  Don’t trust your teeth to all the rest.

MINDY	Which one?

LAURA	Objective?

MINDY	House in the hills, two kids, a dog and a pool-boy named Mario.

LAURA	Black.

MINDY	Yellow it is!  Thank you. (humming)

LAURA	So, who’s the victim?

MINDY	Huh!  A guy a I met online.

LAURA	Ah, one of those.

MINDY	Don’t judge.  We’re young.  I’m having fun.  Zip, please.  You know what you should do is get on the dating sites like me.

LAURA	I’m not desperate.  I didn’t mean it like that.

MINDY	You know what your problem is?  Or one of your many, I should say.  It’s that you don’t embrace contemporary means of courtship, then you get upset that you’re not meeting anybody.  

LAURA	I don’t think people should meet that way.  It should be fate, not Date.com, buy one get one free.  

MINDY	Uh, okay, and so how do you suggest people meet, then, Miss Sunday School?  At the church dance?

LAURA	I don’t know, I mean don’t people just meet anymore?

MINDY	L, a guy would literally have to sit on your head for you to do anything about it.  (laughs) I’m just saying.  Last week, the coffee spill?  Y-you said he was cute.  

LAURA	So?

MINDY	So, you were talking about him for like four days.

LAURA	Uh, no I didn’t.  Okay, maybe just a little.  But you know I have obsessive tendencies and that’s what it was.  Plus, I looked like the freakin’ tooth fairy.

MINDY	Well, yeah, you still could have given him your number.  

LAURA	What was I supposed to say?  “Sorry, I drenched you with my latte, here’s my number?  How about we sit and talk about it some time?”

MINDY	You could have offered to pay for his dry cleaning.  You’ve got to think on your feet because sometimes you only get one shot.  Speaking of, how do I look?

LAURA	I’d do ya.

MINDY	I’ll consider it.  Mwah.  Don’t wait up.

KEVIN	I just can’t get this girl out of my mind, man.  I mean, she was in and out of my life in less than five minutes.  You know how-how electricity can-can pass between people?  The-it was like this-this thing!  Do you know that thing?  It’s like a laser and it I’m ju-I’m-I’m-I’m absolutely, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t get her name, I didn’t get her number, nothing.  I mean, what was I thinking?  Why- what was I thinking?  I don’t kno- what do you think?  Do you think I should just-just-just forget this whole thing?  (exhales)

TED	No.

KEVIN	See?  Me neither.  I think I should go back to that coffee shop and see, I don’t know, maybe she’ll show up again.  

TED	All right. (laughs) I will catch you on the flip side.  You stay away from the racetrack, you crazy gambler.  All right, then.  Okay.  (to Kevin) This guy has a serious gambling problem.  What were you saying?  Kev?

DR. TIM	Dr. Colleen Sanders, psychologist and expert on the Law of Attraction and the author of this new book, “Get What’s Yours.”

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Well, that’s really what my book is talking about.  We’re all part of this universe and it very much wants us to succeed in every area of our lives, be it love, career, wealth, and the universe will create opportunities for us, however it’s up to us to recognize those opportunities, notice the signs.

DR. TIM	So how does this apply to love, for example?  I’m sure we have a lot of single people at home who want to know how to meet that special person, or perhaps maybe to find out if they already have.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Well, Tim, it all really comes down to paying attention to the signs the universe is giving us and do everything possible to take advantage of them and ultimately fulfill what the universe already wants for us.

DR. TIM	So, in a sense, everything happens for a reason.  So get off your butt, get out there and get what’s already yours!

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Exactly.

DR. TIM	We’ll be right back.

CYNDY	Are you avoiding my phone calls, Mister?

KEVIN	No.  I, uh, just thought we were gonna, weren’t gonna, you know, call for a bit?

CYNDY	I-I stopped calling, didn’t I?  (laughs)

KEVIN	So you just decided to… drop by?

CYNDY	I mean how else am I supposed to talk (chuckles) to you if you won’t answer your phone?

KEVIN	I thought we decided to take a little time off.  Even you said it might be good for us, remember?

CYNDY	I just don’t understand why you hate me so much.

KEVIN	Cyndy, I don’t hate you.  You know that’s not true.  I just need to, like, marinate in this new script.  You know, I just-I think you’re like taking this like a little too personally.

CYNDY	Of course I am!  I am a person.  

KEVIN	Yeah, I know that and… but I just need some space, you know?

CYNDY	I’m starving.  Do you have any food?

CYNDY	You know what?  Why don’t we go out to dinner?

KEVIN	No, I’m not hungry.  I just- I have a lot of work to do.

CYNDY	Oh, come on, baby, you’re just tired.  You know?

KEVIN	I don’t know.

CYNDY 	You just need to relax. (gasps) Do you want a laxative?  I think I have some Xanax left.  

KEVIN	No.  Thank you.

CYNDY	Okay, you know what?  Why don’t we just stay in and we’ll get some takeout and we’ll just go on the couch and cuddle.

KEVIN	Okay.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Hi.  

LAURA	Excuse me.  Um, hi.  

LAURA 	I saw you on TV.  I’m a big fan.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Oh, thank you!  Thanks for watching.  Can I also get a pack of Kools menthol, please.

LAURA	Hi.  Can I just ask you a question?

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Uh, sure.  Also a scratcher.  Two.

LAURA	I mean, it’s, uh, something you said on the show.  I am totally gonna buy your book.  I am not looking for a freebie here.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	I only have a few minutes left to my meter, so.

LAURA	Oh, perfect.  Perfect.  I’ll be really quick.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	All right.

LAURA	Okay.  On your show you said everything happens for a reason.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Right.

LAURA	And, uh, there are no coincidences and all that.  

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Yeah.

LIQUOR STORE OWNER	Twenty six fifty-three, please.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Mm-hmm.

LAURA	Well, I just happened to see you on TV and well, here you are!  So if that’s not a coincidence, it’s a sign, right?

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Because you saw me on TV and then you ran into me in a liquor store in Los Angeles?

LAURA	Well, yes.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Sounds like a sign to me.  

LAURA	Yes!  I knew there was something up in the sky.  So what do I do now?

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	I’m so sorry.  I really am in a bit of a rush.

LAURA	I am so gonna get that book.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Best of luck.

LAURA	You, too.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Love the robe.

LAURA	Oh, um.  (chuckles) 

LAURA	Sorry, um.  

MIKE	(laughs)

MINDY	(giggling) That’s so funny.

LAURA	Hi!

MINDY	Hi!

LAURA	I know what I have to do.

MINDY	Okay.  Laura, this is Mike.  Mike, this is my roommate, Laura, in an un-medicated state.  

LAURA	Very nice to meet you.

MIKE	What’s up?

LAURA	So listen, the Universe was sending me a sign.  It’s fate.

MINDY	Okay.  Um, (chuckles) my bedroom is right there, I just might be a minute. (whispering) What are you talking about?

LAURA	The Universe, it was-it was creating an opportunity for me.  I just wasn’t paying attention.

MINDY	Okay.

LAURA	You know, the whole, uh, everything happens for a reason, fate, destiny, there are signs out there.  It’s just up to us to notice them!

MINDY	What signs, honey?  (gasps) Oh, my God.  Did you eat the mushrooms from the freezer?

LAURA	No, silly, listen.  I’m gonna find him.

MINDY	Who?

LAURA	The coffee guy!  

MINDY	How are you planning on doing that?

LAURA	I haven’t figured that out yet.  Maybe I’ll go back to the coffee shop.  Maybe he goes there all the time, maybe I’ll run into him.  

MINDY	Oh, so you’re gonna stalk?

LAURA	No, loiter, really.  Is this crazy?

MINDY	A little crazy’s okay, just promise me you’re not gonna start boiling any rabbits.

LAURA	Hey, you have my word.  

MINDY	And don’t wear the princess outfit.  I know you want to, just don’t.  

LAURA	No.

MINDY	Okay.

ZACK	Yo, Kev!

KEVIN	Zack Steiner.

ZACK	What’s up, bro?  What are you doing here?

KEVIN	Just, you know, uh, hoping to run into you.

ZACK	No shit?  Yeah, I’m here every Saturday after my ride.  They got good wheatgrass.  You like wheatgrass?

KEVIN	Yeah, didn’t know they sold it here.

ZACK	Yeah, secret menu.  I crave the shit after a ride.  Listen, man, I’m sorry about bailing on you the other day.  I had to take my wife to the vet.  

KEVIN	Is she okay?

ZACK	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She’s fine, she’s fine.  It’s her Bichon.  The little bitch had a psychotic reaction to our new lawn fertilizer.  

KEVIN	Wow.  The, uh, the chemicals they put in that stuff, huh?

ZACK	No shit.  Listen, lemme buy you a shot of wheatgrass.  We’ll sit down, we’ll talk about your script.  (exhales smoke) Do you have it on you?

KEVIN	I, no, I actually, yes, I have a copy in my car.

ZACK	Perfect.  Why don’t you grab it, I’ll meet you here.

KEVIN	Okay.

ZACK	Right on.

KEVIN	Sounds like a plan.

ZACK	Go on.

LAURA	So what do I do, because the coffee shop was obviously a bust.

MINDY	Hmm.

LAURA	What if he doesn’t even live in L.A.?  

LAURA	What if he was just here for some meetings and then he hopped right back on a plane to anywhere.

MINDY	To his wife, kids, white picket fence in the suburbs.

LAURA	You think he was married?

MINDY	I think it’s possible.

LAURA	I never even thought of that.  

MINDY	Did you see a ring?

LAURA	I didn’t look.

MINDY	You always have to look for a ring!  

LAURA	Like that’s stopped you.  

MINDY	Okay, excuse me?  That was just one time.  

LAURA	(laughs)

MINDY	Okay, maybe two times, but that other time doesn’t really count because he wasn’t married yet.  

LAURA	Even if coffee guy isn’t married, he probably has a girlfriend or a fiancée.

MINDY	He could be gay.

LAURA	I can totally see that.

MINDY	It’s just an exercise in futility, although not entirely irreversible.  

LAURA	I’m chasing a guy who doesn’t exist. 

MINDY	Oh, honey, aren’t we all?

LAURA	Oh, this is torture.  

MINDY	(whispers) I’ve got an idea.

LAURA	Oh, she has an idea.  

MINDY	It’s brilliant.  It’s brilliant, May.  (giggles)

CYNDY	You know what I was thinking?  

KEVIN	Hmm?

CYNDY	Who made up words?

KEVIN	Words?

CYNDY	Table, dog, insecticide.  

KEVIN	I have no idea, hon.

CYNDY	Just like a bunch of guys a hundred years ago and they’re all sitting around saying, you know, “We have these things, we might as well call them something.  Let’s make up some words.”  

KEVIN	But how did they have that conversation if they hadn’t invented the words yet?

CYNDY	Hmm.  You are so smart.  Mmm, that’s why we’re so good together.  

KEVIN	Yeah, that’s got to be it.

CYNDY	(chuckles) Hmm.

MINDY	Okay, this is it.  This is like the biggest dating site in L.A..  We’ve got straight dating, gay dating, bi-dating, group dating, bizarre and unusual, fetishes, ooh, (chuckles) that’s not for you.  But then, okay, random encounters is what we’re looking for.  This is basically for people who meet each other, feel like they have a connection, but they’re too chicken-shit to do something about it, so it’s pretty much for people like you.  

LAURA	Thank you.

MINDY	So, what we’re going to do is create an ad.  You’re going to say where you met, how it happened and, you know, if he thinks you’re talking about him to send you an email.  And of course your name, email, all that stays anonymous.  You got it?

LAURA	There’s no guarantee that he’s gonna to read this, though, right?

MINDY	No, none.

LAURA	Well, how do we know that he hasn’t put up an ad looking for me?

MINDY	Oh, honey, that wouldn’t have gotten past me.  I troll these sites at least once a day.

LAURA	Silly me, I forgot.

MINDY	Okay, you ready?

LAURA	Yeah.

MINDY	Okay, what do you want it to say?

LAURA	What?

MINDY	The ad!  

LAURA	The ad.  “To Whom it May Concern.”  No, no, no, actually scratch that.

MINDY	Mmm.  

LAURA	“Dear Mystery Man.  Coffee shop, collision, coffee on shirt, spill, so unnecessary.”

MINDY	It’s not a haiku.  It’s okay.  You’ll get it.  Let’s just-let’s-let’s just try something else, okay?

LAURA	Okay.  “Thee who hath coffee stain on thy shirt respond at once or--“

MINDY	Mmm, no, no!  

LAURA	I was just trying to make it stand out.

MINDY	I know.  It’s great but it’s not Shakespeare in the Park.

LAURA	No.  No, no, no.

MINDY	Okay, so what we’re gonna need to do is just keep it-keep it modern, keep it contemporary.  

LAURA	Contemporary.  Contemporary.  All right.  Um, contemporary.  Got it.

MINDY	Okay.

LAURA	(rapping)  Wass’up fellas?  Peeped you at the coffee shop way back, dunked my latte on your threads.  Hit me back if you wanna yack.  What, what?  (normal voice) What?  What?

MINDY	No.  I’m gonna delete that.  We’re gonna pretend like it never happened.  You know what?  I got an idea.  Why don’t you just go downstairs, get us some sushi and I am going to take care of this for both our sakes.  Okay.

LAURA	Yes, please.

MINDY	Go.

TED	You gotta stop going to that coffee shop.  Okay?  Forget about that girl.  Forget about it, I mean I bet she hasn’t even given you a second thought.

KEVIN	You don’t know that.  Don’t say that.  I mean she could be out there right now looking for me.  

TED	Yeah?  What are the chances of that?

KEVIN	Slim to none.  Closer to the none side.

TED	Let it go, bro.  Have I ever given you bad relationship advice?

KEVIN	Well, you introduced me to Cyndy.

TED	You said you wanted to meet someone with a sense of wonder.  Do you remember saying that?  

KEVIN	Yes, but not the sense of wonder of a toddler, Ted.

TED	(laughs) Dude.

KEVIN	Besides, I was in a very different place then.

TED	Dude, don’t blame me, okay?  You asked me to hook it up, I hooked it up.  I always hook it up.  

KEVIN	Well, maybe there’s something you can do to make it up to me for Cyndy.

TED	Like what?

KEVIN	An audition.

TED	You wanna act?

KEVIN	No, I want you to set up an audition.  She is an actress.  The girl from the coffee shop, she’s an actress, so she’ll show up.

TED	Dude, tell me you’re kidding right now.  

KEVIN	Look, if it doesn’t work, I will never mention her again.  I’m serious.  And I will write, day and night, blockbusters, Ted.  Big, nasty action-packed blockbusters that you can sell for big, nasty money.

TED	Now you’re just teasing me.

CYNDY	Sorry, I got lost.  This place is like a big crossword puzzle.  Are you guys having a staring contest?

TED	I’ll do it.

CYNDY	Do what?

ON-SCREEN TEXT	Hi, Laura! 126 UNREAD EMAILS You have  unread emails.

LAURA	What did she write in this ad?

MINDY	(laughing) Oh, my God.

LAURA	It’s gonna be a long night.

MINDY	Morning, Sunshine.  Want some shake?

LAURA	No, no, no, I’m good.

MINDY	Oh, ooh!  Did you get any hits?

LAURA	Hundreds.

MINDY	And?  Want me to help you filter out the freaks?

LAURA	Something tells me that your criteria would have a few less bullet points than mine.

MINDY	Mmm.  Anyone look like your guy?

LAURA	I did narrow it down, a lot, and for the record this internet thing is the craziest thing I’ve ever done for a guy in my life, high school does not count, all thanks to you.  

MINDY	I am just trying to bring you up with modern times.  I’m all for old-fashioned romance.

DAN	(clears throat) Hey, um, I’m, uh, I’m gonna get going now, so.

MINDY	See ya!

DAN	I’ll text ya.

MINDY	Sure.

LAURA	Sounds promising.

MINDY	Okay, what do we got?

LAURA	Okay, so out of the ones that I emailed back, uh, a few emailed me pictures of their

MINDY	Oh!

LAURA	Yeah, I would not recognize him by that.

MINDY	Naturally.

LAURA	I forwarded those to you.

MINDY	I’ll see if know them.

LAURA	And a few others asked if I’d be interested in helping them transfer funds from Tunisia, which I don’t have the time nor the energy to do, although normally I would love to help.

MINDY	Of course you would.

LAURA	So that leaves me with six.

MINDY	Six is great!

LAURA	Although none of them will send a picture, so I’m still left with nothing.

MINDY	Right, twenty-four hours ago you were a spinster, now you’ve got six dates, you’re still unhappy?

LAURA	Yeah, but who knows if any of these guys are the coffee guy.  I mean who knew that so many men in L.A. have coffee spilled on them on a daily basis.  I mean the statistics are mind-boggling!

MINDY	Right, but one of them could be him, that’s the point, isn’t it?

LAURA	I know, but still.

MINDY	Still what?

LAURA	Why can’t it be more like real life, like “Casablanca” or “Pretty Woman”?

MINDY	You want to be a hooker on Hollywood Boulevard?  

LAURA	Yes.  No!  I just- this is crazy!  This is crazy!  

MINDY	Let’s get you ready for some dates.

LAURA	(sighs)

TED	No, no.

KEVIN	What?

TED 	No!

KEVIN	What?

TED	What is this?

KEVIN	It’s exactly how it happened.  I was sitting there, I-I looked up and she just walked into me with a latte.

TED	Dude, this is never gonna work.

KEVIN	Why not?

TED	Because when I put out a casting call the actresses are gonna get the script.  If she reads this, she’s gonna realize something’s up.  

KEVIN	I didn’t think of that.

TED	It doesn’t matter what the script is.  Just as long as she shows up, right?

KEVIN	Mmm.  Yeah.

TED	So, you might as well have fun with this.

KEVIN	What do you mean?  What?

TED	Add a little drama to it.  I mean if I have to watch two dozen girls read this, I’m gonna put a freakin’ hole in my head.  

KEVIN	Gee, thanks, Ted, I’m so glad you’re my agent.

TED	You’re too close to it!  What you need is some objectivity!  Let me write it.

KEVIN	I can write it!

TED	Oh, no, no, I’m your friend, I agreed to help you.  I’ll do the casting call, I’ll write the script.  Deal?

KEVIN	All right.  You cannot change the description, though, okay?  She has to match the description I’m writing for this.

TED	Yeah, I got it.

KEVIN	And you have to keep the coffee spill, like I think it’s cool if she recognizes something.  Then it’s like some kind of secret message between the two of us that only, like, she and I understand, like I think-I think that is romantic, right?

TED	I’ll keep the coffee spill.

TED 	Beer me.  (chuckles) 

CRUTCHES DATE	Are you Laura?

LAURA	Um, yes.

CRUTCHES DATE	I’m Dave.

LAURA	Hi.  So, some girl spilled coffee on you, too?

CRUTCHES DATE	You did, didn’t you?

LAURA	Nope.  Not me.

SLICK RICK DATE	So, maybe you’re not her exactly.  You know, who cares about being exact?  Love’s not an exact science.  Let’s give it time, see where this thing goes.  I mean you’re a woman, I’m a man.  Let’s party a little bit.

STONER DATE	So what if I’m not the guy.  So what if I didn’t go to a proper college.  So what if I’m in a grunge band.  I’m capable of romance.  I know how to seduce.  I know how to love.  But if that’s too much for you to handle, then forget you, man.  Forget you.

PSYCHO DATE	Mother says I should go meet a girl.  Well, then who’s gonna take care of Mother?  Who do you think cooks and cleans?  Who do you think runs the shop?  We got vermin squatting under the house.  Who do you think takes care of that problem, huh?  I don’t usually complain this much.  I just get these headaches sometimes.  If you want, I can show you what I got in the back of my van.  

BUTCH DATE	Sure you don’t wanna try?

LAURA	I’ve got your number.  

MINDY	I told you, you should’a let me filter out the freaks.

LAURA	But they all seemed so normal in their emails.  

MINDY	They always do.  Well, look, at least you’ve gotten rid of a few of ‘em and I bet you have some more in your inbox.

LAURA	I want nothing in my inbox.  

MINDY	(laughs) 

LAURA	I’m done with dates.  No more.

MINDY	All right, maybe you got it outta your system.

LAURA	You have no idea what it feels like to lose your hypothetical soul mate.  

MINDY	You know what?  I’ve got an idea.  

LAURA	(groans) Oh, you and your ideas.  Please do not say you’re thinking electric shock therapy because the coincidence would be way too much for me to handle right now.

MINDY	No, as a matter of fact, I was thinking more along the lines of facials and waxing.  Half-off Brazilian on Tuesday.  Half-off, take it all off.

LAURA	Sounds enticing, but I have an audition.

MINDY	Mmm, anything interesting?

LAURA	Some pilot.

MINDY	Oh, I love pilots.  I’ll show you a cockpit.  Ha-ha-ha.  Zinger!

LAURA	Not helping.  Not helping.  

MINDY	Oh, come on, laugh.  I’m funny.

KEVIN	Um, exc-pardon, I just got-I’m sorry.  Hey.  What did you put in the ad?  It’s like a Hugh Heffner party out there.

TED	I tried to keep it to the average type to maximize our odds.  

KEVIN	Average?  That is not average.  That’s like Victoria’s Secret.  

TED	I don’t understand what the point of this is if they’re not gonna be hot.

KEVIN	The point-you weren’t-mmm, never mind.  Can we just start, please?

TED	Let’s try to make this quick.  I’m paying my assistant overtime.  Angie, send in the first girl, love.

CASTING ASSISTANT	Shelly Swimmers.

TED	I’m the one with the coffee stain in the shape of Africa on my shirt!

AUDITION GIRL #	Well, screw you!  It’s all your fault.  You should watch where you’re going!

TED	Thank you.  That’s all.

AUDITION GIRL #	What is this “Female Heat Hotness Project” anyway?

TED	It’s just like the ad said, uh, a new pilot for Spike TV.

AUDITION GIRL #	Yes, I am dressed as a princess!  You gotta a problem with that?  I… I’m an actress!  

TED	And scene, thank you.  That will be all.

KEVIN	Thank you very much.

CASTING ASSISTANT	Lana Alexis.

AUDITION GIRL #	Should we start at the top?

TED	Top, bottom, I’m fine with both.

AUDITION GIRL #	Screw you!  It’s all your fault!  You should watch where you’re going.

TED	I think your talent warrants a deeper investigation then we actually have time for today.  Do you think it’s possible for my office to arrange a private callback?

CASTING ASSISTANT	Marta Letting?

AUDITION GIRL #	Well, certainly I wouldn’t get upset about that piece of shit suit.  I’m sorry.  Can I-can I start over?

TED	It says here that you can do the splits?

AUDITION GIRL #	Yeah.

TED	Can you show us?

CASTING ASSISTANT	Laura Bloom.  This is Laura Bloom reading for the part of Rebecca.  Laura, this is our casting director, Mary Harr, and our director, Benson Drake.  

BENSON	It’s nice to meet you, Laura.  

LAURA	It’s nice to meet you, too.

MARY HARR	(clears throat) Could we get started, please?

BENSON	Yes, of course.  Uh, let’s start with the scene on top of, um, uh, page sixteen where Rebecca and Steven are talking about what happened at the clock tower.  

MARY HARR	I’ll read Steven.

LAURA	Okay.

MARY HARR	“I-I think Nancy and-and Sam are still trapped in that tower, we’ve got to go get them!”

KEVIN	Remind me to never ask you a favor ever again.

TED	I guess it’s time for you to get some writing done, pal.  Nothing less than a big, nasty money-making blockbuster.  Do you think it’d be weird if I had callbacks at my house?

LAURA	“And we must believe that we can overcome this.  We must have hope.  It’s the only thing that will keep us going.  Without it, we don’t stand a chance.  And neither does all of humanity.”  

BENSON	And scene.  (exhales) Well, that’s all I need to see.  Thank you.

LAURA	Thank you.

MARY HARR	Thank you, Laura.  

LAURA	It was nice meeting you.

BENSON	She was amazing, wasn’t she?

MARY HARR	She was okay.

BENSON	She was really- hold on a second.

MARY HARR	What are you

CASTING ASSISTANT	Stephanie Woodburn.
BENSON	Laura!  Hey.

LAURA	Oh.

BENSON	Hi.

LAURA	Hi.

BENSON	Listen, I thought your read was fantastic.  And, um, I don’t usually do this but I-I couldn’t resist.  Do you mind if I give you a call sometime?  Um, we could get together, um, for dinner and, uh, discuss the part, of course.  

LAURA	The part, uh, sure.  

BENSON	Great.  So I-I’ll get your number from your headshot, all right?

LAURA	Okay.

BENSON	Great.

LAURA	Thank you.

BENSON	All right.

BENSON 	(chuckles) 

KEVIN	Fade in on the desert, vast and desolate.  Angle on a small caravan of… gypsies.  Yeah, gypsies.  As they look up into the sky and see three, no, six… Blackhawks.  (sighs)

KEVIN 	Fade in, a coffee shop in Hollywood.  A girl wearing a princess dress comes out of, no, appears from, no.  Manifests, manifests, yes.  This is beauty in its purest and truest form.

KEVIN	Yo.

TED	How is my action-filled blockbuster coming along?

KEVIN	It’s, uh, great.  I’m working on the big shootout for the opening right now.  Lots of death, you’re gonna love it.

TED	Not as much as you’re gonna love this.  I just got a call from Zack Steiner, he loves the new draft. He’d like you to meet with Terri Preston, like, immediately.  

KEVIN	Uh, Preston Pictures Terri Preston?  

TED	We’re playing with the big girls now, Kev, so put on your big-boy pants.  You hear me?  I want you to get dressed and meet me over there.  I’ll text you the address.  Ciao, baby!

KEVIN	(grunts)

ZACK	Okay, that is what I’m talking about.  That is what people want to see when they drop their fourteen bucks at the multiplex on a Friday night.  That, my friend has juice!

TED	Thanks to you know who.

ZACK	Do you know what I mean by juice, Kev?

TED	Oh, he knows.  

KEVIN	Act

TED	He knows.

ZACK	Okay, what I mean is, it-it-it-it-it it makes me I-I wanna-I wanna-I wanna slaughter a pig with my bare hands and eat the raw flesh right off the carcass and suck out the membranes and the intestines, the sauce, the-the-the-the intestinal juice!  Okay, look, I wanna stand in front of a crowd of people and whip out my… Terri, Terri Preston, our lovely President and CEO.  You know Ted, of course.  

TED	Terri.

ZACK	And, Kevin, the writer.

KEVIN	Pleasure.

TERR	Hi, guys.  Sit.

ZACK	I was just telling Kevin here how much we like his script.

TERRI	It has such a neo-carnal lust, mixed with a-a kind of, um, maternal tenderness.  It’s very rare to see in a spy thriller.  
ZACK	Hmm, yes, the coverage was extremely positive.

KEVIN	The coverage?  Bu-um, but you’ve both read the entire script, haven’t you?

TERRI	Hmm, no need to.  We have people that do that for us.  

ZACK	(scoffs) We’ve got people, Kev.  

TERRI	Oh, I mean, really, if we-if we read every script that came through here (chuckles) we would never get anything done.
ZACK	Mmm, mmm, lots to do.  Lots to do.

TERRI	We have a few notes, of course.  

ZACK	Nothing, tweaks, minor, it’s nothing.

TERRI 	Shall we start from the beginning?  

KEVIN	Love to.

TED	A very good place to start.

LAURA	Have you ever been up there?

MINDY	Where?  Oh, no, I don’t think you can get up there.

LAURA	That’s too bad.  I’ve always wanted to see it up close.  When I was growing up and wanted to become an actress, I’d see it on postcards and I’d think to myself, “One of these days, I’m gonna be there.”  I guess it just represents the magic of this place or something. (chuckles) 

MINDY	The magic?  In Hollywood?  L, you’ve been here a year.  What magical thing has happened?

LAURA	A girl can dream, can’t she?  All I’m saying is one of these days I’m gonna get to that sign.  

MINDY	Oh, you didn’t tell me about your British director.

LAURA	I don’t know much about him.  He asked me to dinner after the audition.  He said he wanted to discuss the role with me.

MINDY	Aw, see?  You say people just don’t meet anymore.  Is he cute? 

LAURA	Well, yeah.  

MINDY	(laughs) Sounds like somebody’s gonna be working extra hard to get that role.

LAURA	Shut up!  I would never do that!  It’s strictly professional, as far as I’m concerned.

MINDY	We should go out tonight.  

LAURA	Why?

MINDY	What do you mean, “Why?”  Why do people go out?  To have fun, to get dolled up.  You know, if you need a reason to celebrate, we’ll celebrate the fact that this guy asked you on a date and perhaps, while we’re there, meet a few other options.

LAURA	Maybe.  

MINDY	I’ll take it as a yes, and I will find something appropriate for you to wear.

LAURA	Our ideas of appropriate are probably pretty opposite.

TED	I mean look at this offer!  This is an offer.

KEVIN	They want me to take out the scene on the ferry.

TED	We are celebrating tonight!

KEVIN	That’s one of the best scenes I’ve ever written.

TED	Mikey!  

TED	Oh my God, Johnny, I love you.  

MAN	Let’s have a good time!

MAN	Whoo!

MINDY	Stop fidgeting, too.

LAURA	I can’t.  This dress is like sliding all over.

MINDY	Oh, honey, that’s what it’s supposed to do.  Hi!  Josh!

BOUNCER	Hey, baby, how you doin’?

MINDY	Looking good.

BOUNCER	All right.  These girls are good, man.  Come on in.

MINDY	I like it.  

BOUNCER	Chill.

MINDY 	Whoo!  Oh!  It’s a good crowd tonight.

LAURA	Yeah.  So how are we supposed to meet people?

MINDY	Oh, come on, look at us!  How do we not meet people?  What do you want?

LAURA	Um…

MINDY	We’ll have two gin and tonics.  

GROUP OF MALE FRIENDS IN CLUB	What’s up!  /  What up, dudes!  / What’s up, man?  /  Yeah!  /  Oh, man.  /  There he is.  /  Oh!  /  This guy right here.  /  Yeah!  /  Oh!  /  Yeah.  /  Oh!   

TED	That’s right.  Give me some love.  It’s all about him, tonight.  It’s all about him.

CLUB SERVER	Yeah?

MINDY	Hey, I need another round.  (to Laura) Why are you so stiff?

LAURA	There’s no breathing room in this dress.  

MINDY	Oh!  

LAURA	What size are you?

MINDY	I’m a two!

LAURA	So am I!

MINDY	Yeah, well the dress is a zero!  I mean, come on, it’s gotta feel like it needs to be ripped off.  Trust me, just go with it!  

KEVIN	(grunts)

CYNDY	You know, now that you’re a big-shot Hollywood writer, I think we should get married.  

KEVIN	What?  Why?

CYNDY	(giggles) Because I don’t wanna be left for some bimbo actress.  

KEVIN	Wait, that’s why you wanna marry me?  So I won’t leave you?  

CYNDY	Yeah, Kevin, I can see you looking at other girls.  
KEVIN	We’re in a club.

CYNDY	So, you should just be looking at me.

KEVIN	I am looking at you.  

CYNDY	Not the way you were looking at her.

KEVIN	Who-she… I, can we please not do this tonight?

CYNDY	Fine.

TED	Brospehine, we’re gonna go bust a move on the dance floor.  Wanna come with us?  Good luck.  Fall out, dance floor.  

GROUP OF MALE FRIENDS	Whoo!

MINDY	We gotta figure out a way to get into the VIP lounge.  

LAURA	What’s up there?  

MINDY	Famous people.

LAURA	Oh, I don’t really care about that, do you?

MINDY	Well, what do you wanna do, stand here all night?

LAURA	I don’t know.  No one’s really asking us to dance.

MINDY	We have to dance with each other, first.

LAURA	Really?

MINDY	Yeah.  Guys love that shit.  Trust me.

LAURA	Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  

MINDY	Wait for it.  It’s all about, like, non-verbal body language, you know?  Feel it.  Yeah, no, but look like you’re really bored and have a serious attitude problem.  It’s okay, we’ll try later.  You’re good.  

KEVIN	Listen, Cyndy we need to talk.

CYNDY	I don’t wanna talk.  You’re a meany.  

KEVIN	I am a meany.  

CYNDI	Mm-hmm.

KEVIN	Which is-which is why I feel like you should be with someone who is nicer to you.  You deserve a

CYNDY	Are you breaking up with me?

KEVIN	This isn’t working, is it?

CYNDY	What’s not working?

KEVIN	You and me.  I-I just feel like we want different things right now.

CYNDY	That isn’t true, okay?  We-we order the exact same thing at In-and-Out and we-we always wanna have sex at the same time and then afterwards we always get thirsty and

KEVIN	Not those things.  I feel like we’re in very different places in our lives.  

CYNDY	(sniffs) Does that mean you don’t wanna marry me?

KEVIN	That’s exactly what it means.  Listen, you are young and you are beautiful and you’re gonna find someone who’s perfect for you.

CYNDY	I don’t wanna find somebody who’s perfect for me, okay?  I want you!  And I’m-I am not that much younger than you, okay?  And in three years we’re gonna be the exact same age.  

KEVIN	Cyndy

CYNDY	What? 

KEVIN	I met someone else.  

CYNDY	You what?  Who is she?  What is her name?

KEVIN	I don’t know.

CYNDY	No, do not lie to me!  What is her name?

KEVIN	I-I don’t know.

CYNDY	I hate you, Kevin!  You’re a jerk.  No, you’re worse than a jerk!  You’re a stupid jerk!  Goodbye!  

MINDY	Ah!  Oh, wait for it!

TED	What’s up, ladies?  How’s it going?

MINDY	Told ya!

HORACE	Hey!

LAURA	Hi!  

HORACE	My name’s Horace.  What’s your name?

LAURA	Laura.

HORACE	Laura?  I got a sister named Laura.  

LAURA	Awesome!  

HORACE	So, you got a boyfriend?

LAURA	Uh, yeah!

HORACE	That’s cool.  Can he do this?

LAURA	Wow!  Uh, that-that was really great.

HORACE	Thank you!  

LAURA	I’m gonna run to the restroom.  Excuse me for a second.

HORACE	All right, I’ll be right here.

LAURA	Okay.  (to Mindy) I’m gonna go to the restroom.  You wanna come?

MINDY	No!  

CYNDY	Oh my God.  

LAURA	Are you okay?

CYNDY	No, do I look like I’m okay?

LAURA	Should I go get someone?

CYNDY	No, I just-my boyfriend just broke up with me.

LAURA	I’m sorry.

CYNDY	Whatever.  

LAURA	Do you want to get cleaned up?  Get you out of here?

CYNDY	Okay.  

LAURA	Got it?

CYNDY	Mm-hmm.

LAURA	All right.  All right.  You good?

CYNDY	Mm-hmm.

LAURA	Okay.

CYNDY	Oh, my-my makeup is all ruined.

LAURA	No, no, no, it’s okay.  Look.  There we go.

CYNDY	(breathe hitches) And he cheated on me.  With someone else.

LAURA	Well, you know what?  You’re gonna get over him.  You’re gonna get over him or he’s gonna come crawling back to you first.  

CYNDY	You know what I’m gonna do? (chuckles) I’m gonna find that bitch, and I’m gonna sock her in the face, and I’m gonna give her a black eye.  That’s what I’m gonna do.

LAURA	Oh.  Good for you.

CYNDY	She’s a bitch!  

LAURA	Bitch!

CYNDY	Bitch.  (whimpering)

LAURA	Do you have a ride home?  

CYNDY	No!  He broke up with me!  I told you that.  (crying)  

MINDY	(screaming) 

TED	Wanna get a drink?

MINDY	What?

TED	A drink!  I got the VIP booth upstairs.

MINDY	Oh, no, no, no, I gotta wait for my friend.  She’s in the bathroom.

TED	Oh, no, no, my friend Horace will watch out for her.  Don’t worry.  Horace, you’ll watch out for her friend?

HORACE	Oh, I’ll make sure she’s a happy camper.

MINDY	Wait, will you make sure she gets upstairs when you find her? 

HORACE	Will do!  (yells)

LAURA	Hey!  Stay right here just one second, okay?  Don’t move.

LAURA	Excuse me.  Excuse me, pardon me.  (to Cyndi) You okay?  

CYNDY	I think I’m gonna be sick.

LAURA 	All right, all right, all right, let’s get you outta here.  

MINDY	Are you talking to the drink?

TED	It’s a blue drink.  Get your blue on.

TED	Just like the movie.  (sings) Those Hollywood nights.  Those Hollywood hills.  

TED	No, no, your dance moves were outstanding out there.

MINDY	Thank you.

TED	Really good.

MINDY	Thank you.

TED	It-it makes me think of my friend, uh, Janelle.  Sh-you guys have the same exact hair color and your dancing was almost identical.

TED	I was telling her how good of a dancer you were.

WOMAN	Oh.

TED	Yeah.  And just like when we were out there it made me think of like you and then, you know, she sort of has like the moves and so, uh.

WOMAN	Oh, I see.  (chuckles) 

MINDY	Hi!

KEVIN	Hi.

MINDY	Why are you so sad over here in the corner?

KEVIN	I’m not sad.  I’m just hanging out.

MINDY	What’s your name?

KEVIN	Kevin.  What’s your name?

MINDY	Mindy.

KEVIN	Hi, Mindy.

MINDY	Hi.

LAURA	Hey, Mindy, it’s me.  Um, I looked everywhere for you.  I’m sorry.  I had to go.  I’ll explain it to you later.  Give me a call.  I’m going home.  Okay, bye. 

CYNDY	Oh, we’re here.

LAURA	Are you gonna be okay?

CYNDY	Mm-hmm.  Um, thank you for being so nice.  Um, you can have your tissues back.

LAURA	Thank you.  Do you want help to the door?

CYNDY	I’m good.

LAURA	Just remember that everything that happens is for the best, okay?  There are a lot of guys out there.  A lot of fish in the sea.  Okay?

CYNDY	Mm-hmm.  (whimpering) Thank you.  Bye.  

LAURA	Oh, okay.

CYNDY	Oh, God.

LAURA 	Uh, take care.

CYNDY	Stuck.

LAURA	Bye.

GROUP OF MALE FRIENDS 	We are the champions.  /  Time to party!  /  Whoo!  /  Whoo!

KEVIN	Your pen.

MINDY	You’re gonna call me?  Yes?  Yes, you better.  

KEVIN	I’ll call you.

MINDY	You.  

TED	Hey, man.  You see that?  One door closes, another door opens.  Yes.  

MINDY	Laura?  Laura?  What happened to you?

LAURA	I looked everywhere for you.  

MINDY	Aw.

LAURA	I saw this drunk girl in the bathroom, and the poor thing was so upset that I had to help her get home.  What?

MINDY	I met someone.

LAURA	Really?  At the club?  

MINDY	Mm-hmm.

LAURA	And you didn’t bring him home?  That’s a first.  

MINDY	Trust me, it was not for my lack of trying, but I did give him my number.  (laughs) His name is Kevin and he’s a total cutie.  And evidently newly single, which means rebound.  It just goes to show you have to be in the right place at the right time.  

LAURA	Which is something I’m apparently terrible at.  

MINDY	Okay, you have a date with the director.

LAURA	Okay, it’s not a date.  It’s a meeting.

MINDY	Oh, I’m sure that’s what he thinks, too.

LAURA	It is.  So is this Kevin guy gonna call you?

MINDY	Oh, I hope so.  Mmm, I have got plans for him.  

LAURA	You’re so bad.

MINDY	This guy is so much fun, he’s so cute!  He’s so cute!  

MINDY	Oh!  What are you reading?

LAURA	Shhh.  

MINDY	Where do you think he’s gonna take you tonight?

LAURA	I am not really sure.  

MINDY	We should go on a double date.

LAURA	(chuckles) It’s not a date.  It’s a meeting.

MINDY	You’re just afraid I’m gonna steal your director.

LAURA	(scoffs) No.

MINDY	Oh!  You think it’s mine or yours?

BENSON 	Hi.

MINDY	Hi!

BENSON 	How are you doing?

MINDY	One second.  I’m just gonna go grab her.  Of course you got the punctual one.  Take that sweater off.

LAURA	I like the sweater.

MINDY	It’s hideous.

LAURA	(sighs)

MINDY	Take it

LAURA	I like the sweater.

LAURA	Interesting place.

BENSON	Yeah, Moroccan.  You come for the lamb, but you stay for the belly dancers.  Yeah, the lamb here is quite yummy.  Mmm-mmm.

LAURA	Yummy is good.

BENSON	Yup.

LAURA	Oh, the chicken kabob looks good, too.

BENSON	So, you’re decided then?  Perfect.  So, Laura, tell me a little bit about yourself.  Where are you from, for instance?  

LAURA	Akron, Ohio.

BENSON	Mmm, absolutely hated Ohio.  

LAURA	I’m sorry to hear that.

BENSON	Spent three of the most miserable months of my entire life over there.  Was doing a film a few years back.  It was a dramatic film, you know, about class struggles.  I just found it to be such a dreary place, so middle class, you know?  I-I just found it to be depressing, don’t you think?

LAURA	I don’t think so.  

BENSON	Oh, come on, now.  I mean you did leave there to come here, right?  I mean you’re here in sunny Los Angeles, right?  I mean it must be much better here, right?  Yeah, come on.

LAURA	It has its charms.

BENSON	Indeed it has.  (chuckles) 

KEVIN	Cheers.

MINDY	I’m so glad you called.

KEVIN	To calling.

MINDY	To calling.

KEVIN	Right?

MINDY	Yeah.  Mmm.

KEVIN	So?  You didn’t think I would call?

MINDY	Oh, I knew you would call.  I love guys that don’t play games.  It’s great.

KEVIN	Yeah?

MINDY	Yes.

KEVIN	I don’t-I don’t play games.

MINDY	Mmm.

KEVIN	It’s, uh, it’s not the way I roll.

MINDY	That’s your thing?  It’s so funny because I’ve gone out with so many guys and they play all these games and you, I just knew, I just knew there was something different, you know?

KEVIN	Now, see, I feel like girls are the ones who play games.

MINDY	Oh, come on.

KEVIN	Women, I’m sorry, pardon me, women.

MINDY	Thank you very much.

KEVIN	You’re definitely a woman, not a girl.

MINDY	Let’s-wait, let’s play a drinking game.

KEVIN	Am I still talking?

MINDY	You are, but let’s-let’s do every time you say w-w-w-woman we drink.

KEVIN	Okay.

MINDY	What’s the opposite of man?

KEVIN	The last time I been with a wom

MINDY	Whoop, ah!  (giggling)

KEVIN	Oh my goodness.

BENSON	Did you see a movie I did last year called “The Spiral Orifice?”  

LAURA	Mmm-mmm.

BENSON	It did fantastic in Europe.  Do you find that American people just don’t really appreciate films with real complexity?

LAURA	I think movies should be fun.  I think movies should make you laugh and cry, but mainly laugh.  I really like comedies.

BENSON	Eh, it’s all right.  You-you still got much to learn about human suffering.

RESTAURANT SERVER	Have you decided yet?

BENSON	Yeah, we’re gonna have, uh, two lamb, please, uh, sauce on the side if you don’t mind and, uh, none of those little green things.  They-they’re horrible, really sour.  Personally I think they do a disservice to the dish, you might wanna communicate that over to the chef. 

RESTAURANT SERVER	I’ll be sure to let him know that.

BENSON	You do that.  Did I tell you I’m a bit of a connoisseur of food, as well?

LAURA	You don’t say?

BENSON	Yeah.

MINDY	Ready?

KEVIN	Yes!

MINDY	To…

KEVIN	The end of prohibition.

MINDY	(laughs) I love it.  No, you gotta-- (unintelligible).  

KEVIN	Ah, it burns!  Do you have a-do you have a-do you have a lime or something?

MINDY	Oh, no, come on.  Next one, next one.

KEVIN	Ne

MINDY	Come on!  Go!  Go!  Uh!

KEVIN	Who are you?

MINDY	Mmm.  The best thing that’s ever happened to you, I know it is. No.  (laughs) 

KEVIN	Oh, that’s awful!  (gagging) I’m dying.  

MINDY	No-no!  No, no, no.  (laughs)

KEVIN	Are you doing another one?

MINDY	Yes!

KEVIN	I can’t do another one.

MINDY	Yes, you can!  Go!  Uh!  Take it!

KEVIN	Okay.

MINDY	Ew.

KEVIN	I’m gonna die tonight.

BENSON	Touch upon things that speak to everybody, that everyone can understand and just, you know, relate to.  So, so making films is always an uphill creative struggle, but, you know, the fight, it must go on.  

LAURA	(scoffs) 

BENSON	Sorry, so where were we?  Oh, we’re here, right?  Yeah.

LAURA	That we are.

BENSON	Great.

LAURA	Thank you for dinner.

BENSON	It was my pleasure.  Well, so we should continue the evening upstairs, right?  Yeah, is

LAURA	I’m-I’m kind of tired.  I think I’m gonna call it a night.

BENSON	Come on now, love.  I did show you a good time, now, didn’t I?  You don’t wanna be rude.  You did have fun, right?  

LAURA	I had so much fun.

BENSON	Right.  And you do want a part in my next film, yes?  

LAURA	Yeah, I’m-I’m-I would love that, and I’m sorry that we didn’t get a chance to talk about the part.

BENSON	Well, perhaps we can have that conversation upstairs in your flat.  Yeah?

LAURA	I-I think you’re a really great guy, and I had a really good time.

BENSON	Thank you.  Yeah?

LAURA	But it’s a bit late.

BENSON	(scoffs) Oh, darling, you really must be tired.  Let me try and, uh, explain it to you this way.  

LAURA	What are you doing?  Get off me!  What are you doing?

BENSON	Why are you being such a little prude?  You know, I do hope you know you’re being awfully rude here!  Huh?  

LAURA	Good night, Benson.  

BENSON	What?  Well, you can forget about getting a part in my next film.  You’ll be lucky if you get a part in a puppet theater!

LAURA	(crying)

MINDY	(laughing) 

MINDY	(laughs) Shh.  (giggles)

KEVIN	(grunts)  Oh.  Oh.  No, not, uh. 

MINDY	(breathing heavy)

KEVIN	You know how when you first meet someone and you just, you know in that instant that-that this is it, this is-this is good, this is-this is, so I’ve been waiting for it.

KEVIN	Oh.  But then for some reason you just can’t quite say the right thing, you don’t do the right thing.  You don’t-you just let ‘em go.  You just let her walk away.

MINDY	(yawning)

KEVIN	Do you know what I’m talking about?

MINDY	No, I don’t.

KEVIN	That’s okay, too.

MINDY	I don’t like complications.  

KEVIN	Oh, I had a rough day.

MINDY	Aw.

KEVIN	Oh.

MINDY	Well maybe I can make it better. (giggles) Ah.

KEVIN	What-no!  Mmm-mmm.  

MINDY	N-no.

KEVIN	Mmm-mmm.  No-no-no.  I’m just gonna.  I’m sorry.  You’re, look, you’re terrific.  You’re-you’re beautiful and whatever we were gonna do here, I would normally do it.  I just can’t.

MINDY	Wait-wait-wait, you can’t or you don’t want to?

KEVIN	Probably both.

MINDY	Because if it’s that you can’t, I’ve got something you can take, it’ll just pick things right up.

KEVIN	No, no, no, no, no, no, look, I-I’m just-I, sorry.  This is-this is all very lovely.  

MINDY	Look, you can’t, you’re not gonna be able to get a cab right now.  You can’t go back.  Just-just stay.

KEVIN	(moans)

MINDY	And, um, sleep it off.  Go home in the morning.

KEVIN	No, no, no, no.

MINDY	Stay here, sleep it off.

KEVIN	Mmm.

MINDY	Really.  It’s-look, it’s nice to sleep next to somebody even if we don’t do anything.  

KEVIN	Okay.

MINDY	Okay.  Hmmm.

KEVIN	(groans) 

KEVIN 	(vomiting) (sniffing) (gagging)

KEVIN	Oh.  (spitting) Ah.  (sniffling) 

LAURA	You’re Kevin.

KEVIN	You know me.  You spilled the-the coffee on me a couple of weeks ago.  And you were wearing the princess costume and

LAURA	That stain ever come out?

KEVIN	No, no.  

LAURA	Shame.  Okay.  It was nice seeing you.  Again.  I gotta go.

KEVIN	Hold on.  So you’re Mindy’s roommate?  

LAURA	It seems that way, doesn’t it?

KEVIN	Look, we, I mean, um, Mi-we-Mi-we-we’re not

LAURA	You might wanna keep your voice down.  It might ruin your morning after getaway.

KEVIN	You have the total wrong idea here.  Um

LAURA	You don’t owe me an explanation.  Besides, um, I’ve got a date, a breakfast date.

KEVIN	Look, this is just one, uh, big misunderstanding.  I mean, Mindy and I, we-we-we-we, like I didn’t, I was –

LAURA	I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  I’m just not in the, uh, habit of chatting up my roommate’s one night stands.  You’re never gonna see her again, right?

KEVIN	Uh, you don’t-you don’t know what you’re talking about.  Sh-okay, if it helps you to write me off as some kind of asshole, then so be it.  I don’t blame you ‘cause that’s exactly what this looks like.  Sh- uh, you just don’t-you don’t know me.  

LAURA	You’re right, I don’t know you.  I’ve gotta go.  

KEVIN	Okay.  All right, I get it.  I’m sorry.  

LAURA	Sorry for what?  I-I’m not the one that you should be apologizing to, if anyone.

KEVIN	Um, could you just tell me your name?

LAURA	Laura.

KEVIN	Well, goodbye, Laura.

LAURA	Goodbye, Kevin.

MINDY	(laughs) Oh-oh-oh.  Look who’s in the same dress from last night.  I wanna hear everything.  

LAURA	Trust me, it’s not what you think.

MINDY	Oh, come on.  What happened?

LAURA	I don’t wanna talk about it.

MINDY	Okay, that is so not fair.  If anyone deserves to hear all the details it’s me, because I tell you (whispers) everything.  

LAURA	Yeah, except I never remember asking.

MINDY	Whoa.  Wait, what’s going on?  Did something happen?

LAURA	Nothing happened, okay?  I’m not gonna see him again.  He’s a jerk.  Just like everyone else in this town.

MINDY	Okay, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa wait.  Wait a minute!

LAURA	What?  You wanna fill me in on last night’s steamy details?  Because I am really not interested.

MINDY	Whoa, way to jump to conclusions.  What is wrong with you right now?

LAURA	I really don’t think I’m jumping to anything.  I saw your little buddy dodge outta your room this morning.

MINDY	Oh, okay.  Why do you even care?

LAURA	I don’t care!  That’s my point exactly.  And I’m so tired of hearing about how everything went perfect for you and how you stayed up all night having

MINDY	Okay, first of all, you don’t even know what you’re talking about.  You’re assuming that I had some amazing date and we just jumped into bed together, which is not at all the case!  Secondly

LAURA	What is the case?  I saw him!

MINDY	Okay, you saw him.  He happened to sleep on top of the sheets with his shoes on so there are no steamy details to report.  You kn-God, Laura, all I wanted was to hear how your date went.  But you don’t care, and you know what?  Neither do I! 

MINDY	What?

LAURA	Mindy?  Can I come in?

MINDY	No.

LAURA	It was him.

MINDY	Who?

LAURA	Kevin, your date.  It was him.

MINDY	What?

LAURA	It’s my coffee guy.

MINDY	Kevin, the guy that left my room this morning, that’s your coffee guy?  Holy shit!

KEVIN	All right, okay.

KEVIN 	Come on, can we, like, figure something out here?  

IGOR	No.

KEVIN	I mean, you’re a reasonable guy, right?

IGOR	No.

KEVIN	Okay, so, um, wha-what am I supposed to do?

IGOR 	Get it from impound.

KEVIN	But it’s not at the impound yet, that’s my point.  

IGOR	Will be there in twenty minutes.  Larry’s Towing, my friend, and Larry has rules.  Sorry.

KEVIN	Okay, all right!  Fine!  Will you at least give me a ride there?

LAURA	So you don’t have a phone number or anything?

MINDY	No, look, I mean I gave him my number at the club and then-then he called me from a restricted number.  I-I-oh, I don’t even know his last name!

LAURA	So nothing happened?  Like, nothing.

MINDY	Well, in the interest of full disclosure, I did take his pants off, but nothing happened!  The boxer’s stayed intact, that’s it, nothing.  I swear.

LAURA	God, how could I be so stupid!  He was right in front of me and I basically kicked him out.

MINDY	We will find him.  You look right, I’ll look left and use one of these, you look a little crazy.

LAURA	Well, I feel a little crazy.

MINDY	I know he parked it right here.  (sighs)

LAURA	I really blew it, didn’t I?

MINDY	Well, you know, we’ll find him.  

LAURA	Let’s just go home.

KEVIN	What?

IGOR	Nothing.

KEVIN	You’re smiling and shaking your head.

IGOR	Man, you-you give up too easy, man.  Everybody wants their car.  You have to work for it. 

KEVIN	I-I tried reasoning with you.  I-I didn’t just say, like, “Can I have my car back?” 

IGOR	Reasoning.  Reasoning is not enough.  Have to see some emotion.  I need to see you really need it.  Maybe cry a little bit.  All I’m trying to say is you already had your chance, and what you did, just gave up.  So, no.  

KEVIN	What do you want me to do, like, beg?

IGOR	(chuckles) 

KEVIN	I’m begging you.  Can I please have my car back?

IGOR	No.

MINDY	Do you want to go get a bagel or something?

LAURA	I’m not hungry. 

MINDY	Ooh!  Okay, what about-what about that place that you love, that brunch place where they have the, um, you know, those bottomless mimosas and Bellinis and the French toast, right?  We can go there.  

LAURA	No, I just need to take a walk or something.  Just feel like I need to clear my head.

MINDY	Like, right now, with what you’re wearing?

LAURA	Can you drop me somewhere?

MINDY	Yeah, of course.  I mean, where do you want to go?

LAURA	Up there.

KEVIN	No, no, I’m begging you, I’m begging you on my knees.  Can I please have my car back.  

IGOR	Stand up!  Stand up!  Just stand up.  Oh, come on, man.  Don’t do that.

KEVIN	Well, please?

IGOR	Behave yourself.

KEVIN	What’s your name?

IGOR	Igor.

KEVIN	Well, Igor, I met a girl.

IGOR	Good for you.

KEVIN	And I need my car to find her.

IGOR	Yeah, huh?  And you want me to believe you.  

KEVIN	Have you ever been in love?

IGOR	Yes, I was.  But I never parked my car where it says, “No parking.”

KEVIN	Right.  Hey, listen, Igor, can you take me?  Can you give me a ride somewhere?  

IGOR	Where?

MINDY	Are you sure you don’t want me to come with?

LAURA 	Yeah, I just, I wanna be alone.

MINDY	I mean, I can wait.  

LAURA	No, you should go.  Um, I’ll figure out a way to get home.  Thank you for everything.  I mean it.  Okay?


MINDY	Oh, come on, I didn’t really do anything except for get your boyfriend drunk and take his pants off.

LAURA	(chuckles) 

MINDY	(chuckles) 

LAURA	I love you.

MINDY	Oh.  It’s just a boy, L.  

LAURA 	I know.  

KEVIN	Mindy.

LAURA	Oh, my God!  

KEVIN	Hi.

MINDY	Don’t move!

KEVIN	Look, I just-I wanna apologize to you for this morning.

MINDY	No-no-no-shhh-shhh-shhh I gotta think.  	I gotta think.

KEVIN	Look, all I wanna do is I-I wanna apologize to you because that was not

MINDY	I got it!  You’re coming with me.

KEVIN	What?  Where?

MINDY	Come on.  

MINDY	You’re coming with me!  Come on!  Come on!

KEVIN	Where?

MINDY	Go, go, go, go!  She’s up there!  Yeah.  Go!  

KEVIN	Laura?

LAURA	What are you doing here?

KEVIN	Hoping to run into you.

DR. TIM	And that’s their story, folks.  We are once again talking to Dr. Colleen Sanders about her newest book, “A Practical Guide to Fulfilling Your Destiny.”  Thank you so much for being here with us again, Colleen.  

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	(laughs) It is always my pleasure, Tim.  

DR. TIM	Well, now, without further ado, let’s bring ‘em out to our stage, please welcome Kevin and Laura.

DR. TIM 	Kevin, everybody out there wants to know when the movie about all this is gonna be coming out.

KEVIN	Uh, well, it’s already written, but it’s gonna be a while.  Some people are having a tough time with the ending.  

DR. TIM	The ending, yeah, that’s important in a movie, gotta have a good ending.  Well, maybe we can help you out with that a little bit.  We’re pretty creative here.  Don’t you have, uh, a surprise for us today?

KEVIN	I sure do, Tim, I sure do.  

LAURA	What surprise?

DR. TIM	Oh, come on now.  

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	(laughs) 

DR. TIM	Don’t you worry about it, darlin’.  Don’t you worry.  I’m not Jerry Springer.  That’s not what this show is all about, so.  

KEVIN & LAURA	(laughs)

DR. TIM	Kevin?

KEVIN	All right.  Laura, the last two years have been the most exciting years of my entire life.  Every time I look at you

LAURA	Yes.  (crying)

KEVIN	The only thi-… Yes!

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	This is the proof, ladies.  Get my new book.  It works.  

DR. TIM	Yes, it obviously does work.  Look at them go.  I am telling you, how about that for a happy ending, Hollywood?  And you saw it right here on the Dr. Tim show.  We’ll be right back.

DR. COLLEEN SANDERS	Oh!  Dr. Tim.
