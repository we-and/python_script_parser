Jess	(tisk) sooo..all that... preparation and planning...

Jess	(laughs)

Mel	(sighs) I totally ruined the meatloaf. It was a disaster. It would make a good doorstop, but wasn't going to be a good anniversary dinner.
	
Jess	Hey, come on. It's ok. You know that I like takeout! Besides, it's not about the cuisine. It's about the company.
	
Mel	(blows air) Oh God I love you!

Jess	(laughs) Yeah, I kinda figured that.

Mel	It's me and you against the world right?

Jess	I mean come on, the world doesn't stand a chance, but what if..it was three of us?

Haley	What are you talkin about? I make every scene.

Lindsay	Catch me if you can!

Mel	ohhh. Wow. Two new additions. Hopefully we didn't bite off more than we can chew.
	
Jess	(laughs) Speaking of chew, looks like one of them just found a new chew toy.
	
Lindsay	This smells so good! This is mine now.


Mel	Hey! Those are my favorite sweat socks!


Jess	(laughing) Well, let the compromises begin. Welcome to family life.

Haley	Hey, give that back! I found it first! Get back here!

Mel	That's good to know.


Delilah	Just a little reminder. I'm going to go check on them ok. Hey guys! Did you poop yet!


Jess	Oh Mel, listen, despite this little snafu, today, is the best day of my life. Worst day of my life!

Mel	So that that's it! You're you're just gonna leave?

Jess	There's nothing else to talk about.


Mel	Yeah, you know cause I thought, I thought that we had something special!


Jess	Well so did I! But if you're not willing to support my career decisions...
	
Mel	Moving to Los Angeles is ridiculous! Ok, you can put on makeup here!
	
Jess	Working for the largest cosmetics company in the world is not just putting on makeup! You think that my career is just some sort of hobby! Your dream of having some woman cook and clean and take care of you is delusional!
	
	
	





Mel	So, so I'm supposed to sell my parents ranch! huh? Give up my entire life and move with you to Los Angeles, the, the black hole of depravity!
	
Jess	Tell me what you really think!
	
Lindsay	Hey, what's going on?! This isn't fair. We're family, we're supposed to stay together.

Mel	You know what, fine! Go ahead, go, see if I care!
	
Jess	You can take back your poop ring! You want Lindsay's sweat sock too?

Mel	No, no. You know what, she can keep that.

Jess	You know where I'll be.

Mel	You know where I'll be. 

Jess	Goodbye Mel.

Mel	Goodbye Jess.
 

Lindsay	(Puppy cries)

Jess	Hey don't worry, Lindsay. We'll find a new home. No matter how. You'll see.


Powers	Uh Jessica, could you please come to my office.


Jess	Yes, Powers.

Lindsay	Powers calls, you go running.
	
Jess	Um..Powers?

Powers	Do you know what time it is?

Powers	Let me rephrase that. Can you guess what time it is?

Jess	Ten thirty-four.

Powers	No. It is time to celebrate! I'll get it...we're gonna celebrate this, watch..Celebration time, watch it! yeehoooo!
	
	
 
	








Lindsay	Hey, watch it!
	
Jess	Uh! ok, what are we celebrating?

Powers	Your new scent, Xtraordinar has just been approved to go to market! HA!

Jess	That's amazing! Lindsay, did you hear that...
	
Lindsay	Be careful.

Jess	oh, oh my gosh, I'm so sorry! Let me just clean that up. Just one..

Powers	Never apologize it's a sign of weakness, and please, we pay people to do that. They clean, we celebrate.

Jess	uh, wow, uh, so it was already approved?
 
Powers	With flying scents! I told you, with my management prowess you are on the road to success in no time. And no time is now time. Morphascent Cosmetics is going to send you on a nationwide publicity to launch Xtraordinar, the androgynous scent for men and women!
	
Lindsay	What's this about a tour? You know I have abandonment issues.

Powers	A toast, to the most beautiful, hard working, and soon to make me the richaaa, happiest husband on planet earth. Lipstick..

Jess	Uh..I'm sorry, isn't this all just going a bit fast?
 
Powers	Poppycock! You've been working on this for four long years. All I did was just grease the wheels a little to make them spin faster. Leonard!

Leonard	I heard my name! .

Lindsay	grrrrrrrrrrrr Nice doggy..

Powers	(breathing out) go on! go on! oh the sample!
	
Leonard	Close your eyes. (singing) Don't you dare open those eyes. You're going to be so excited. I can't wait to see your reaction. Tahdah!
	
Powers	What do you think?
	
Jess	It's my face.
	
Lindsay	Whoa, that is freaky.

Powers	You're coming into your own, Jess. And I have got it all worked out. You're going to go on your publicity tour to launch Xtraordinar. When you get back in a few weeks, wedding bells will be ringing. we are going to get married in a hot air balloon followed by a flock of doves over hundreds of people. Everyone is going to be there! Possibly even a few people you know.
 
Jess	oh, well..uh..What about Lindsay?


Powers	Who?

Leonard	Lindsay, the dog.

Lindsay	Yeah, what about me? I go everywhere with her.

Powers	Oh! oh, well yeah I mean she will be the pup of honor.

Lindsay	You know I don't like you, right?

Jess	No, no. I,I meant for the publicity tour.

Leonard	nonoono, No dogs. No


Powers	We don't want dogs on a pub...they can't sell perfume. They sm....
	

Jess	You guys know that I can't go anywhere without her.

Lindsay	Yes. Put that foot down. Just watch where you step.

Powers	But of course you won't go anywhere without her! hahaha, Well my..your assistant Leonard will be there the whole entire time. And a, if there's anything you need he will be there to fetch it for you, so to speak. heheh
	
Leonard	I'll be there, I'll be there. yeah.
	
Powers	So, is everything ready?

Leonard	Oh everything's ready, Mr. Andrews. The tickets are purchased, the bags are packed. I hired a nice little driver. Ex Military, I think Special Ops. And you're going to need to dust off your cowboy boots because we are going to Montana!
	
	
Lindsay	What did he just say?

Jess	I'm sorry. Wait, um, Montana




Powers	Yeah, I figured that we'd stack the deck in, in our favor. Hometown girl makes good. You'll be a smash! Toast of the town! They have toast in Montana?

Leonard	I think so.


Jess	I'm sorry, I just haven't been back to Montana you know since..well since I left.
	
Powers	Oh yeah, and you left a nobody and you're coming a star! The publicity practically writes itself! In fact, Leonard, get our people on that right away!
	
Leonard	I'll be on it.

Powers	I love you kid. Big things are afoot for us. Big things, for both of us! Hey, listen, don't forget this is a throat coat business. It it is a dog eat dog world! out there! No offense.
 
	
Lindsay	Dog eat what?

Powers	But, I want you to do me a favor. Do not listen to what anybody has to say. No one. You just do what you feel in your heart is right. Unless that person knows what's best for you. Like me! hehehe. Lipstick.
	
Leonard	Mr. Andrews, Could I talk to you about the a little bit the pronunciation?

Powers	Sure, yes

Leonard	What do you think about Xtraordinar?

Powers	uhhhhh...I hate it.


Jess	Wow. Well alright. Lindsay, what do you say? You and me kiddo..on an adventure to Montana.

Lindsay	(puppy whine) Montana, huh. How's the weather this time of year? Will I get dry fur?
	
Haley	Howdy Clark. What's the word on the street, Martin? Hey there Julie. Good to see ya. Hey ladies. Lookin good today. ruff, ruff, ruff (barking)

Mel	Hey! Quit your barkin.

Haley	Just greetin the world. You should give it a try.


Mel	Huh, you're all excited aren't ya? Gonna go see Delilah Higgins in your dog park resort, right?

Haley	Oh great, I can see my friends!


Mel	We just got one stop to make. Gotta keep the lights on don't we? Gotta keep you fed. Huh?


Haley	You know getting fed is always high on my to do list.
	

Sally Ann	Have a nice day.

Customer	Thanks.
	

Haley	Hey, What are you carrying there? Is that food for me?

Mel	Hey Sally Ann.

Sally Ann	Hey Mel.

Mel	Where's you father?

Sally Ann	He takes weekends off now, but he gave me permission to pay you top dollar.

Mel	Thanks. You know you might be overpaying me just a little bit.

Sally Ann	You're are best provider, Mel. You're worth every penny and then some. So where's the town's most eligible bachelor off to now?
	
Mel	Uh, Delilah Higgins place.
 

Sally Ann	You're still volunteering there?

Mel	Yeah. You know she could use the help and you know her knees, and hips, and back, and is not what it used to be. Besides, Haley loves it.
	
Haley	That's true, but not as much as I love food.

Sally Ann 	You know sometimes I think you like hanging  around more with animals than you do with people. You ever think about settling down with someone with two legs rather than four?

Mel	I don't know. Least with animals you know where you stand.

Sally Ann	You're always in good standing with me, Mel. You too Haley.

Haley	Something smells good.

Sally Ann	Gotcha two more bags of your favorite dog food.

Mel	Ah, Would you mind putting that in my pick up truck?

Grocery Clerk	Red one?

Mel	Yeah.

Grocery Clerk	Of course.

Mel	Thank you. You trying to win over my dogs heart?

Sally Ann	It's a start. So you gonna go to the fair this weekend?

Mel	Yeah, I'll be there. My beef stews gonna win first place.
	
Sally Ann	(sigh) and he cooks too.

Mel	(deep breath out) I'll see you around, Sally Ann

Sally Ann	Count on it.

Mel	Come on, Let's go Haley! (whistles)

Haley	Can I ride in the back? I wanna protect that grub.
 
Mel	Thanks, bud.
	
Leonard	Now, I have your itinerary, right here. Here you go.
	
Jess	Ok

Lindsay	I'm Miss Reynold's consultant. I'll look these over first.

Jess	Lindsay! Hey!

Leonard	Lindsay! Those aren't for you!

Lindsay	My bad.

Jess	I just..I don't know what's gotten into her.

Leonard	The Devil perhaps. Mutt could use a shock collar and some little cement shoes.

Lindsay	Try it, and you'll be singing soprano forever. (bark)
	



Leonard	oh..no..Lindsay, get off! Get off Lindsay! Stop it, ow! ah, ow! Lindsay, stop it! Get off  of me!- (whispers) disgusting.
	
Mel	You wanna check it out?
 
Haley	Does a dog get fleas?

Mel	Alright, go on.

Delilah	Hey you're back!
	

Mel	Yeah.

Delilah	What did you say?

Mel	I said, yeah I'm back.

Delilah	No, my back's fine. It's about the only part of me that is fine these days, but..

Mel	How are you feeling?

Delilah	Well you know it comes and it goes. Is what it is. Mel, this is none of my business, but I really don't think it's healthy for you to be spending all your time here. You know there is a whole world out there. There's women. There's dating. Women. Bingo. Bingo tournaments with women. There's skydiving which you would love! Skydiving with women. There ya go!
		
Mel	I, I like it here.

Delilah	Of course I can hear you. I'm not that deaf. Not yet, but you know what I think? I'm beginning to have my memory going.

Mel	Delilah, don't worry about me, ok. I'm going to be fine. I got my ranch, business is great. You know Haley, Haley's amazing.

Delilah	How do I put this subtly. YOU NEED A GIRLFRIEND, MEL!

Mel	You know you're the one who's hard of hearing. Not me.

Delilah	Yes you. I've seen the way these girls look at you. At least I would if everything wasn't so blurry, and I hear things. A little muffled, but I do hear them. What is going on with you and Sally Ann, huh?
	
Mel	We're just friends. She's not my type.

Delilah	Who cares if she can type? That's a very overrated skill, especially in this day and age. The point is, she's a female. She's a human female!


Mel	I get it. I get it. She's a member of the opposite sex.




Delilah	(laughs) She's not opposed to sex,not that one! That's the silliest thing I've ever heard. And I do hear things. Guess who's coming into town today?
	
Mel	Who?

Delilah	I asked you. Who?
	
Delilah	What was I saying? Oh gosh, oh I hate this. I think my memory's starting to go.

Mel	Do you need some dog food for the kennel? Cause I got a ton in my truck.


Delilah	You know what, we could really use some dog food for the kennel. Do you have any extra in your truck?
	
Mel	I'll see what I can do.

Delilah	No, I can't see what you're doing, but I trust you. Good boy! you want another one? Come on, you want another treat? Oh, good boy! You're beautiful! Umhum.

Jess	So, my thought was to create a new fragrance for women on the go. Something that... blends...with your... natural scent. Uh, and really highlights...the.. well..just highlights the positive stuff. Um, which is why Xtraordinar is truly extraordinary. Um, it really accents the positive, and then it um says negative no way get out of here. Ok. Let me just give you guys a sample. Here ya go. here ya go.
	
Lindsay	(whines) Oh boy, she's not doing to well. I've got to stop this. Oh,It smells like the Botanical gardens caught on fire in here.

Salon Patron	When will this be available to buy?

Jess	Um, I can actually give you a free sample today.
 
Lindsay	This is torture. I have to do something about this, so smell up.

Leonard	No! Lindsay!

Jess	Lindsay! Lindsay! oh no! Lindsay! Oh!
	
Lindsay	Hey, this isn't cool!

Jess	Does anyone have a towel and I'll clean, I'll clean everything right up. Oh God, Oh no!

Patrons	(laughing)




Leonard	Lindsay, I appreciate your efforts, but you will not be bothering Ms. Reynolds anymore. You're going to go away and disappear, and I'm going to see to it.

Lindsay	Can't blame this on me. I've been framed! I want to speak to a lawyer.
	
Powers	(breathing hard) Speak!

Leonard	It's Leonard, Sir. Um, everything's going great, except for the dog. The dog is terrible. Trying to ruin everything.

Powers	Oh God, I hate that dog. Can't you lose it in Montana or something? Isn't there a pastures out there you can leave it in?

Leonard	There are a lot of pastures with deep holes.

Powers	Good, well find one that preferably has some wolves or mountain lions or some kind of bear in it or something and leave it there. There's no way I'm letting a that fleabag get in the way of me profiting of of Jessica's success. I have worked way too hard watching her work way too hard for this. You understand me?
	
Leonard	Understood, yes. Yes.
 
Powers	Leonard, you are my eyes and ears out there. If she blinks, If she sneezes, if she even breaks wind I want to know about it. I want to smells like, what it sounds like, the texture, and I want a demonstration. You hear me!
	
Leonard	Ok


Powers	Over and out. (breathing hard)
	
Leonard	Hey buddy.

Frank	Call me Frank.

Leonard	Franklin?

Frank	Whatever.


Leonard	Well, with your local knowledge, do you have any way of making a dog disappear?

Frank	You mean (whistle) disa..

Leonard	No, no, nonononono! Just hidden for awhile.

Frank	Right down the road, Big Sky Animal Shelter.

Leonard	Will you take that dog there? Here you go. Will that do it? ok.. and my bag is getting heavy. Will you take it to our next appointment? We'll be walking. Ok? Thanks, Franklin.
	
Lindsay	Unfair I say. This treatment shouldn't happen to a dog! Hey, this place smells familiar.

Delilah	Can I help you?
 
Frank	Ah yes ma'am. I've got this rather rambunctious little dog and I need a place for him to stay for a few hours.
	
Delilah	A place to play.

Frank	Yeah, that will be fine too. yeah.

Delilah	Oh, no we don't charge much. We take all animals here. However we do take donations.
	
Frank	Yes, yes, thank you very much. I'll be back by the end of the day to pick him up. Thank you very much.

Delilah	Lindsay! (laughs) oh boy, oh boy. There ya go.

Lindsay	Hey Delilah.
	
Mel	Yeah, I noticed you're, you're also running low on some bedding pads.I'll run into town and pick some up.

Delilah	You're going into town? Could you pick us up some bedding pads? We're kinda running low here.

Mel	It's a good idea, Delilah. 

Delilah	Still sharp as a twig.

Mel	Be back soon girl. Keep an eye on her.

Lindsay	Wait, was he talking to me?

Delilah	Tac! Tac! I'm sharp as a tac!
	
Lindsay	(sniff, sniff) Hey, that's my sisters sock!
	

Zeik	Finders Keepers!
	


Lindsay	Steelers Weepers! (barking) You're a dead dog if I can catch you! Hey get back here, that's mine!

Zeik	ha, ha, mine now.
	
Shepherd dog	Uhuhu..Uhuhu..so then what happened?

Haley	So I go up to that chicken and say in my scary voice, "You better start layin eggs bucko, or else!

Shepherd dog	Or else what?

Haley	Well...that's what's great about or else. You don't need specifics. It's like the worst thing you can imagine. Let me tell ya, Bucko the chicken started laying eggs. Zeik! Where ya goin in such a hurry?

Zeik	Runnin away from you!.	HUH?
	
	
Haley	Hey! What's the big idea?

Lindsay	Pardon me, I was just chasing........

Lindsay, Haley	Why do you look like me?! Stop repeating what I'm saying! Stop it! I mean it! JINX!
 
Zeik	Who put a mirror in here?

Shepherd dog	Why do you two look alike?

Lindsay	Haley?!

Haley	Lindsay?

Zeik	Ha, ha, Freaky Friday!

Shepherd dog	No, that's a different movie, Zeik.

Lindsay	Sis?

Haley	Wherrr, Where ya been?!
	

Lindsay	Sis! LA, with Jess. What about you?


Haley	Right here with Mel. We never left the ol' Homestead, remember?

Lindsay	Actually, it's kind of hazy. I was just a puppy back then.


Haley	What was I, chicken liver? We have lots of catchin up to do. What brings ya back?

Lindsay	Jess is doing a publicity tour for a new smell she invented.
	
Haley	Huh, Jess smells?

Lindsay	All the time! It's her business. She's a professional smeller. I don't mind, but I don't like the people she smells with. She has this assistant, Leonard, who hates me. I don't care for him either, and she's engaged to this Powers guy I really don't trust.
	
Haley	At least she's with someone. Mel's all alone. He acts like he's cool with it, but I can sense he's lonely even with me around. I think he misses Jess.
	
Lindsay	I barely remember Mel, but I bet Jessica would be better off with him than with Powers and Leonard.
	
Haley	Heeeeyyyy, Wouldn't it be great if Jess and Mel got back together?

Lindsay	Then we could be a family again! But..wait, when we get back to LA she's getting married

Haley	Well, we can't let that happen. You have to stop her from leavin so we can hook our humans backup.
	
Lindsay	How? I don't know the detours in this town like you do.

Haley	I got it! I got it!

Zeik	The fleas again?

Haley	No Ziek. We switch places. I'll be you and you be me.

Lindsay	Say what!

Haley	Once they've figured out they have the wrong dog they will have to return us to each other. Criss-Cross. Then we all meet in the middle like a deer in headlights. BAM!!!

Lindsay	It'll never work. We're nothing alike. Personality wise.

Haley	I got plenty of personality!

Lindsay	I'm talking about the way you act. You're too.	country.
 
	
Haley	And proud of it! Oooh!

Lindsay	If you're going to be me, you have to have a certain amount of class. Walk tall, watch your manners, only eat meat that is well cooked or at the very least medium rare.






Haley	No problemo, and if your gonna be me you gotta get a little down and dirty. Don't be a stick in the mud, play, let loose. Pee where you want, when you want, and make no apologies. Oh, and there's one more thing.

Lindsay	Hey! What are you doing!? OH MY GOD! I'm naked!

Haley	Give me a break. Now you pull off mine.

Mel	Fancy, fancy
	
Leonard	Well! I think that went wonderfully Ms. Reynolds.

Jess	Better than last time. Lindsay! Where's my dog? Why isn't she in the car?
	
Leonard	I thought she was..Franklin, where is Ms. Reynolds dog?

Frank	At the animal shelter, like we spoke...

Leonard	What! You put Lindsay in an animal shelter! Why would you do something like that? We'll get her back ASAP.
	
Jess	Yes, we will! Not happy about this! Not happy at all!
 
Leonard	shhhh. shhhhh

Delilah	(humming)

Haley	Hey Delilah, hopin you can help us out.

Delilah	What happened here?

Lindsay	I don't know about this. I hope she gets it.


Delilah	(bell dings, she laughs) Aw, you two! Come, there, yeah, ok stay, ok hang on. Ok, stay, alright hang on. Ow!
	
Haley	Success!
	
Haley	Let the games begin!
	
Mel	(coughs) alright, here ya go Delilah.

Delilah	Where am I going?
 



Mel	I don't know where you're going, Delilah, but I'm going. I'm going home. I gotta start cookin if I'm gonna be ready for for the fair.
	
Delilah	Oh. umhum. What's this?

Mel	Ah, it's bedding pads. See ya later, Delilah.

Delilah	No, I won't see you. I'm going blind, remember!
	
Mel	(whistles) Let's go Haley. Time to go. Playtime's over.

Haley	Ok, so how'll we stay in contact?

Lindsay	Don't worry, I'll find you.

Haley	Ok. I trust you. Good luck!

Mel	Haley, come on! Hey, hey, yeah, oh oh yeah! Hey, hey girl. Hey, did you miss me? Yeah, I missed you. It's good to see you too! Yeah, come on. Homeward bound. Let's go. Alright Delilah, We'll see you later.
	
Jess	Lindsay! Lindsay better be here!

Leonard	I'm sorry, I just thought it would be in the dogs best interest to..not be at the presentations.

Jess	Delilah!? Oh my goodness! (laughing)
 
Delilah	Jessie Reynolds! Ohhhh wonderful! I knew someone important was coming to town! (laughing)

Jess	(laughing) Oh my goodness! So you're still working here.

Delilah	Dear, I may be too old for men, but one is never too old for dogs. (laughs)

Jess	(laughs) Well I hear that dogs take better care of you then men anyway.

Delilah	Oho, your telling me, they certainly do! How long are you here for?

Jess	Uh, just a short while. We're just passing through, really. Is Lindsay here?
	
Delilah	Yeah. She is. yes.

Jess	Oh, thank God. Lindsay! Oh my goodness! Girl! Lindsay!

Haley	Jessie!

Jess	Aww. I've missed ya. I've missed you, girl. Oh my goodness.
	
	


Delilah	A girl and her dog. There's no sweeter thing on earth. You plannin on seeing Mel while you're here?

Jess	Uh.No um, I don't think so. I doubt if he'd really want to see me again.

Delilah	Oh I doubt that your right about that.

Jess	Do you see Mel often?

Delilah	I don't see much often anymore dear. I'm blind as a beagle. Blind as a bat!
	
Leonard	Speaking of bats. We should be using out echo locators and going to the airport.

Delilah	Who's your lovely tall lady friend, dear?

Jess	Uh, this is Leonard.
	
Delilah	Well that's a strange name for a gal in Montana anyway. (laughs)
	
Leonard	We should really be going. Um, tight schedule, and this place smells like, like..
	
Delilah	I like it too. Take a deep breath. (breathes in) through your nostrils and your home!

Leonard	Okay.

Jess Delilah

Jess	Ah, it was so good to see you. Take care Delilah.

Delilah	These days I'll take what I can get.

Jess	(laughs) Alright, come on Lindsay girl, let's go.

Haley	(barks)
 
Delilah	So nice to meet you. Lessie, Lesley?

Leonard	Leonard. Leonard.

Delilah	Lesley, Nice to meet you, Lesley,You're lovely! Bye, take care of Jess!

Leonard	Bye, I'm going. Bye
	
Lindsay	My home. My real home.


Mel	Come on. Got some stew to cook. You got some eatin to do. It's dinner time.
	
Lindsay	Dinner sounds like an excellent idea to me.

Haley	Geez, Never been in a spaceship before.

Jess	I'm sorry that I yelled at you, Leonard. I know you were just trying to help.
	
Leonard	It's ok Ms. Reynolds. No harm no foul. We are a little behind but we should be able to make the next flight to Dallas.

Haley	Don't get much sun in here. huh?

Leonard	Franklin, step on it!

Haley	Leaving already! Uhoh

Jess	Wait, next flight..why leaving so quick? I thought that I thought I would have some time to look around and..

Leonard	(pshhhh) Why? There's nothing here but wide open spaces infested with wild and domesticated animals and they stink.
	
Haley	I speak for all animals when I say, that's pretty offensive.
 
Jess	Wow. Just been awhile since I've been back and I thought I'd have a little time.

Leonard	(scoffs) See, Ms. Reynolds that's exactly the problem. We do have little time. Mr. Andrews runs a tight ship and he doesn't allow for any dilly-dallying.
	
Jess	Don't I know it. No time to stop and smell the flowers. Isn't that right, Lindsay?

Haley	That's a good idea. I think we should stop and smell flowers.

Jess	Lindsay? Lindsay, what has gotten into you?

Leonard	Uh,

Jess	I think she needs to go out.

Leonard	No! It'll throw us off schedule. We're not stopping.

Haley	(growling) Franklin, continue.

Jess	Franklin, please stop the car!

Leonard	We're not, We are not stopping.

Haley	Oh yeah?

Leonard	OH! Lindsay, stay away from my shoes! NO! Ah Franklin, yes we can stop. We can stop right now very briefly.
	
Frank	Are you serious! ahhh.

Leonard	It's ok.

Jess	No, Lindsay! No!

Leonard	Disgusting, animals.
	
Mel	Haley, it's your favorite. Num Nums.
 

Lindsay	Uhhh. This is disgusting. What is this?

Mel	What? You love this stuff!

Lindsay	You're serving me poison. I think Haley's been humoring you.

Mel	Oh you want some of my stew. Ok, well let me finish cooking it Princess then I'll give you some.

Lindsay	We need to have a serious conversation about diet.
	
Haley	Oh boy, I need to come up with something fast!

Leonard	This better not take too long.

Haley	I need to find the scent, and I need to find the trail.

Jess	Wow, it really is beautiful. We don't get vistas like this in LA.
	
Haley	It's this way. Time for a little hide and seek.

Jess	Lindsay! Lindsay!

Haley	(giggle) Better come get me.

Jess	She's never done this before!

Leonard	We have really got to get going or we are going to miss the last flight.

Jess	I'm not leaving without my dog. I'll get her. Lindsay! Lindsay! Hey, come on!
	
Haley	I'm pretending to not hear you.
 
Leonard	I'm calling Powers. Looks like we're spending the night.

Lindsay	This place is disgusting. He could use some help around here. A maid or something.

Doorbell	(Doorbell rings)
	
Sally Ann	Surprise!

Mel	Yes it is. Uh, Sally, It's really great to see you always, but why are you here?
	
Sally Ann	Well, I thought you could use some more supplies to make your famous stew.

Mel	Um, I'm pretty much all set.

Sally Ann	Well, you know these bags are getting kinda heavy.

Mel	Oh! yeah, let me take those. Come on in.
	
Sally Ann	Hi, Haley! How do I look?

Lindsay	(growls) Like competition.
	
Haley	Peekaboo! Come on Jess, love awaits. Follow mee!

Jess	Lindsay! Hey come on! Now is not playtime! Where are you going? Lindsay, Lindsay!

Haley	Catch me if you can! This is so much fun.

Jess	Hey!

Haley	I'm so good at this.

Jess	Where are you going!
 
Haley	Follow me and you'll see. (barks)

Jess	(breathing hard and gasps) Are you serious!

Sally Ann	Oh so that's your secret ingredient.

Mel	Shhh. Can't tell anyone.

Sally Ann	Or you'll have to kill me?

Mel	Yeah. Put you in one of my stews. Call me the demon farmer of beef street.
	
	
	
	
	

Sally Ann	(laughs)Ah, smells delicious.

Mel	mmm, wait until you taste it.
	
Sally Ann	My lips are ready.

Lindsay	You better not kiss her! Don't do it!
	
Mel	OH!

Sally Ann	(gasps)

Mel	Haley! What's gotten into you! I am so sorry. She, she hasn't done something like that since she was a PUPPY. Or maybe that was Lindsay.
	
Sally Ann	Tastes good. You want a lick?

Mel	Uh. look, you can um go upstairs and just take off your..uh put on one of my shirts, towel, uh (sigh) What is wrong with you!

Lindsay	Uhhh, I plead the fifth.

Jess	Lindsay! What has gotten into you! Is it the Montana air? Wait a minute. oh we're not.. I don't believe it. You found your way home. hum. It's like nothings changed.

Haley	That's right, You're home again. Hopefully forever.

Jess	Alright. Come on, we gotta go.
	
Haley	Hold your horses honey. Stay awhile. Trust me.

Jess	(sigh)... I wonder if he's home.

Mel	I thought that you liked Sally Ann? Huh? What, are you gettin jealous, girl?

Lindsay	Her? palease. There's someone better out there for you.

Mel	You know Sally and I are just friends. Just friends. (sigh) You know maybe I should rethink that. Face the facts. Jess is never comin back. Delilah's right. I should move on with my life.Right?

Lindsay	Wrong, so wrong.
Jess	Wait. Lindsay! (whispers) Lindsay, hey get over here! Lindsay! No, come here. Hey, come on. Well, I guess Mel found someone too.

Haley	UHOH, she's not supposed to be here.

Jess	Alright Lindsay, let's go. We don't want to disturb them do we?



Haley	No. This is some kind of mistake. Sally Ann and Mel aren't an item. He's still in love with you. Trust me on this one.
		
Jess	Alright. Come on girl. (Phone rings) Oh shoot! Hi, Powers.

Powers	Hello? Is that you? Hey what's going on there! You missed your flight. Is everything ok sweetie..pie?

Jess	Yes, Lindsay ran away, but I found her so you don't have anything to worry about.

Lindsay	This is about to get good.

Powers	Wait, wait, what, what's that? Speak up, I can't hear you.
 
Jess	I'm fine. I just can't talk any louder than this. Let me call you back.

Mel	Jessica?

Jess	(gasps) Mel!
	
Haley	This is so exciting! Back together again.

Lindsay	You didn't tell me he had a girlfriend.

Haley	Relax, they're just friends.

Jess	(breathes out) Fancy seeing you here.

Mel	Well, um..my home is usually a good place to find me. Wh.. why are you here?

Jess	I'm not here. I mean I'm here, but I'm not staying.

Powers	Not where? Who, what! Where are you, who is that!

Jess	Oh, um, I'm at Mel's place.

Powers	Mel Danberry your ex boyfriend!

Jess	Yes.

Mel	Who ya talkin to?

Jess	Powers Andrews.

Powers	Yes!

Jess	He's my fiance.

Powers	Mel's your fiance!

Jess	No! no you are.

Mel	I am your what?
 
Jess	My ex boyfriend.

Powers	Your breaking up with me!

Jess	No! I'm marrying you!

Mel	What?

Powers	I'm so confused! What, what on earth is going on out there! My hands are sweating! They never sweat!

Sally Ann	What's going on here? Who's she?

Haley	Well this is not helping our cause.

Lindsay	They were going to kiss. I had to improvise.

Mel	This is Jessica Reynolds.
	
Sally Ann	I thought you two broke up?

Mel, Jess	We did.
	
Jess	Powers listen, there's nothing going on here. I'm going to have to call you back.

Powers	Hello! Hello! Hello! Oh no.

Jess	I'm sorry. Um. I didn't mean to..bother you. I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
		
Mel	In the neighborhood?

Jess	Chasing Lindsay.

Haley	(barks)
 
Mel	Oh my God! Lindsay! Oh my God, Lindsay! Look at you! Oh my God look at how much you've grown! (laughs)

Jess	Uh yeah, so has Haley. I mean you can barely tell them apart.

Lindsay	That's the concept in a nutshell.

Mel	Well it's good to see you girl. mmmm(kiss noise)

Haley	Yeah, it's been three hours. Missed you too. (barks) Talk to Jess.

Mel	So she ran away, what from Los Angeles?

Jess	No, um, I'm actually here on a publicity tour for my, my new perfume, Xtraordinar.
	
Mel	You sure are.
	
Hale	I knew it! The flame still burns.

Lindsay	We're geniuses!

Mel	Would you like to come in?

Jess	No, I, I don't want to intrude. Besides, it looks like you've got your hands full.
	
Sally Ann	Oh Mel and I were just cooking and I got all wet. 

Jess	You don't say.

Haley	She did not just say that.

Jess	Um, Why don't you just point me to the road.

Mel	Where's your car?
 
Jess	My limo, um, I think it's back there somewhere.
	
Jess	Come on Lindsay.

Haley	I'm not going anywhere, Jess. 

Mel	Where ya stayin?

Jess	I don't know. I'm sure my assistant Leonard will find me a place.

Mel	Come inside. Come on, five minutes.
	
Lindsay	So we got them together, now how do we keep them together?

Haley	Don't worry, love is in the air.

Lindsay	Really? All I smell is perfume and beef stew.

Powers	Leonard! ohhhhohhhohhhh, I am bitterly disappointed in you. Jess is supposed to be on a plane right now! You know where she is, huh! You know where she is! You know where she is! She is at her ex boyfriends house!

Leonard	I will have her on a plane first thing tomorrow, Mr. Andrews.
 

Powers	Oh you better! Because the buyers tracking report says that Xtraordinar is going to be a HUGE success! Which means Jess is going to be filthy rich, which means that I am going to be filthy rich when we are married! And nothing is going to get in the way of that! Not some rabid ex boyfriend, and certainly not that flea ridden dirt bag that she calls a dog! (screams) Ok, ok (deep breath in and out) Breathe and calm.You are in control.You are in control of this. The world is your oyster. (breathes) LAUREN GET ME A TICKET TO MONTANA! NOW!

Mel	Ahh, so, publicity tour, a limo, personal assistant, a new fiance, well you've done well for yourself.
	
Jess	Livin my LA life.

Mel	That's, that's wonderful. You look great. And you, you seem happy. You don..you don't need to get that?

Jess	Uh, no it can wait. Um, yeah, I mean city life you know can be a little overwhelming, but I mean I really can't complain. So, How about you? Sally Ann huh?
	
Mel	Yeheyes. Yeah, she's great. She runs the a grocery store downtown.
	
Jess	(laughs) So it's business and pleasure.

Mel	Yeah. Yeah I guess you could say that.
		
Haley	Why aren't they kissing?

Lindsay	Here comes one of the reasons

Sally Ann	Hey I should get goin. Looks like you guys have some catching up to do so...

Jess	Oh a nonsense. I'm really the one who should be going.

Haley	No! Absolutely not!

Jerss	You know what they say. Two's company but...

Sally Ann	Three's a ménage á trois.

Haley	I don't speak French.

Lindsay	Crowd, I think it's French for crowd.

Jess	I'm gonna call Leonard to pick me up, um!
 
Mel	No, nono. Don't be silly, ok look, I will take you to town. Let me just go put my stew away.

Jess	Gravy.

Sally Ann	Uhuh.

Jess	(whispers) okay

Haley	What now?

Lindsay	Mel and Jess need some alone time together that's what.
	
Sally Ann	You know I could give Jessica a ride back to town. It's no bother.
	
Mel	No. Listen, you've done enough, Sally. Thank you. Uh, besides, looks like Haley and Lindsay are inseparable again.
	
Jess	Just like old times.

Mel	It is.
	
Sally Ann	(sigh) Ok, well I'll see you at the fair tomorrow when you take first prize. I've got the gravy stains to prove it.
	
Lindsay	They just need more time together, so...let...me.. just fix this.	truck
	
Haley	What's that gonna do?

Lindsay	You'll see. Just let me...get this...in here a..little bit.

Haley	This better work.
 
Lindsay	It will. Trust me.

Haley	I guess I don't have a choice, do I?

Lindsay	That should do it!

Jess	Gravy stains, huh?

Mel	It's actually a funny story with that one.

Jess	I bet. Why don't you tell me on the ride back to town.

Mel	Ok
	
Jess	Are you taking the back roads?

Mel	It, it's quicker.

Jess	Oh, so you're trying to get rid of me?

Mel	No no, no, no, no that's not it. I...thought..I thought you might be in a hurry so I..

Jess	I'm kidding. Besides, I wouldn't wa..I wouldn't blame you. I did show up... unexpected.

Mel	(laughs) Yeah, yes, that was definitely a surprise, and it was not a..an unpleasant surprise.

Jess	Well, you were always like, full of surprises. I was just trying for a change.

Mel	What the...NO, No, No. No, No, No!

Jess	What?,,,You've gotta be kidding me!
	
Mel	(coughing) Aw God. I think we threw a rod. I don't understand, this trucks never given me any trouble before!
 
Jess	Well can you fix it?

Mel	Nah, This isn't going anywhere.

Jess	Ok, well I'll just call the local gas station. Do you know the number? Minor problem. No reception. Do you have a cell phone?

Mel	Nope. Well, as you know.. don't really work out here. Plus not a big fan being on call twenty-four seven.
	
Jess	(tisk) Yeah, I remember. Alright, so what do we do? Walk?

Mel	(tisk) Well it's probably about twenty miles to town. Ten miles back to my place, but I do have some camping equipment in the back.
	
Jess	I'm hungry. What are we going to eat?

Mel	How do you like your eggs? 

Jess	Raw...I

Mel	Scrambled, over-easy, sunny side up?

Haley	Let's leave these two alone for a bit.

Jess	It's pretty good. All without the help of takeout. (laughing quietly)
 
Mel	You should try my beef stew. Best beef stew in the county.
	
Jess	(short laugh) I believe it.

Mel	I've made improvements. you know.

Jess	I can tell.

Mel	(blows out breath) So what about this, um, Powers guy? Huh? Does he cook for you?

Jess	I wouldn't exactly call Powers the hands on type. Unless it comes to money contracts. I don't want to talk about him. Can't remember the last time I went camping like this.

Mel	June 10th, 2012. We were coming back from your moms. We got home and found that an army of cats had taken over our place. Turned it into their own personal litter box. (laughs)
	
Jess	(laughs) oh that's right! Took all week to fumigate.

Haley	Insert cat joke here.

Mel	Well, so we went on that campin trip.

Lindsay	I really hope they kiss soon.

Haley	Yeah, me too.

Jess	You remember the exact date?

Mel	No, no, I just made it up, made it up. Thought it might impress you.

Jess	Trying to impress me. Why?
 
Mel	Look at you. You're this big city girl. You come back and visit your old country boyfriend. Come on, how am I supposed to compete with that? Compete with that whole LA lifestyle.
	
Jess	There's no competition. (clears throat) Two totally different worlds.

Lindsay	I think I prefer this place.

Haley	Don't have skies like this in LA?

Lindsay	We live in a condo. What's a sky?

Mel	LA. Must be exciting.
	
Jess	It gets old sometimes.

Mel	This gets old.

Jess	(laughs) This is beautiful.
	
Lindsay	It sure is beautiful. NOW KISS! Come on.

Jess	It's almost like you planned for your truck to break down.



Mel	Yeah, I planned this whole thing. Planned for my truck to break down. Then you must have planned for no cell service.

Lindsay	Uhoh, I think they're onto us! Let's give the lovebirds some privacy.
	
Mel, Jess	Nooo

Mel	No You can use the sleeping bag.

Jess	There's only one.

Mel	I usually only need one.

Jess	For you and...Miss Gravy Stains.

Mel	There's nothin between Sally Ann and I. You said you don't want to talk about Powers. I don't want to talk about Sally Ann. Deal?

Jess	Fair enough. To be even more fair, Do you, promise to behave yourself? I'll let you share the sleeping bag with me.

Mel	I'm good.

Jess	(scoffs) You're chilly. Stop acting stupid.

Mel	Ohhh, so now you're calling me stupid huh?

Jess	Yeah. Only when you act stupid.

Mel	Now I remember why we split up in the first place.

Jess	Oh you're just now remembering that?

Mel	Uhuh, you're funny.

Jess	It's a gift.

Mel

 Mel	If you say so.

Jess	I always say so.	Um (clears throat)

Mel	Move over. Let me just get in a little. Can you move over there. Ok. (grunts, laughs)

Jess	(grunts, laughs)

Mel	(laughs) Did you check for snakes?

Jess	(laughs)

Mel	ahhhh (laughing)
 
Mel	Are you ok?

Jess	Perfect.

Haley	Look! they're together.

Lindsay	Let's make sure they stay together.
	
Haley	be careful!

Lindsay	I've got this, relax.
	
Frank	Yo! Any word from Ms. Reynolds? I checked the Danberry ranch. Nada.

Leonard	I called her twenty-seven times last night. She didn't call me back, she didn't answer, she didn't do anything! I know she's dead! I'm going to lose my job again just like in Milan. She was probably abducted by some militia lumberjack organization and now I'm going to lose my job! I've got to take this. Jessica!

Powers	Oh, you still haven't found her, have you?


Leonard	Not, not yet, Mr. Andrews.

Powers	Alright, well, pick me up.

Leonard	Ha! Physically? I don't think I'm strong enough for that, Sir!
 
Powers	eh, no, nonono. I'm at the airport, or at least what they call an airport. It's more like a barn surrounded by planes, but I just arrived.

Leonard	You're in Montana?

Powers	Yes! I took the red eye. I'm exhausted! Please hurry, I do not like to wait.
	
Leonard	To the airport, fast! Wait! I'm supposed to be in the car!

Lindsay	Awwww, so cute! They look so happy!

Haley	Why did they break up? Mel never talks about it.

Lindsay	Had something to do with her job, his dream, the house,but I think she's been longing for a change.
	
Mel	Uh, morning.

Jess	Uh, yeah. Good morning.

Mel	Yeah.

Jess	It's a little snug in here, don't you think?

Mel	Yeah, It's a one person sleeping bag. Er, ok.

Jess	Ok.

Mel	Let me see if I can get the zipper..it's not...

Jess	What is it?

Mel	It's not going, I think it's... it's...it's broken.

Jess	Very funny, Mel.

Mel	No, I'm not joking.

Jess	Oh come on, you have got to get me ou..out of this thing!

Mel	I can't! Ok..Hair is everywhere! Everywhere!

Jess	Well yeah, that's because it's attached to my head!

Mel	No, and in my face!

Jess	Ok, well maybe if you didn't have such big stupid broad shoulders, maybe you'd get out of this thing by now!
	
Mel	Oh nice! Nice, so now I have stupid shoulders?

Jess	Uhuh, yeah!

Mel	Yeah, nice. Ok. (grunts)

Jess	Why'd you zip us in so tight!

Mel	Look, I didn't!

Jess	Yeah, then who did? What, the dogs?

Lindsay	I don't know what you're talking about.

Jess, Mel	(sighs)

Mel	Ok look. Listen I got a pocket knife,but I can't reach it, so just, you give me a reach around...I got a pocket knife, but I can't reach it, so just, you give me a reach around...

Mel	I,I ok, let's try and wiggle out. No wiggle!

Jess	oh no, nononono

Lindsay	But I'm kinda enjoying this.

Jess	I can't wiggle!
	
Mel	(hard breath out) Are you ok? Are you ok?

Jess	I'm ok. (laughing)

Haley	Oh no, what did you do? Are they ok? You're taking the blame for this one.

Lindsay	That's alright with me.

Jess	Oh my gosh. (laughing)

Mel	Oh God...(laughing)
 
Jess	That was terrible! (groaning)

Mel	(groaning) That's one way to wake up! Let's get out of here.

Jess	Alright.

Frank	Yo, hey, hey, come on press the one on the right! Come on!

Leonard	Where do you mountain people learn how to drive!
	
Haley	So nice out here. If this isn't romantic, I don't know what is.

Lindsay	OH! OH! I've never had so much fun in my life!

Haley	Wait for meeee!

Mel	So when's the big day? The wedding.

Jess	Oh uh right. Um, when I get back. Powers has the whole thing planned out.

Mel	Really? He must be quite the guy.

Jess	What does that mean?

Mel	I don't know, you lettin somebody plan out your life for ya. Just doesn't seem like you, Jess.

Jess	Look, like I said the city is different. Everything's faster, sometimes I just don't have time to..

Mel	To breathe.
 
Jess	Or think. It's just rush, rush, rush.

Mel	Hence the assistant.

Jess	(Laughs) Leonard is probably freaking out right now. He has no idea where I am. Neither do I.

Mel	That makes three of us.

Jess	I thought you said you knew where we were.

Mel	Relax. I know exactly where we are.
	
Lindsay	(barks)

Mel	Hey, looks like Ol Glory got out of his stall again.
	
Jess	Ol'Glory, Jim Parkers horse.

Mel	You got a good memory. You tired of walkin?

Jess	Oh no we can't take Ol'Glory.


Mel	Borrow. Borrow. Besides, Jim will be glad if we bring her back.
	
Leonard	We will find her Mr. Andrews. Rest assured of that.
	
Powers	I am not rest assured of Anything, Leonard! Nothing! (ugh) What is going on around here?

Leonard	(whispers) I don't know.
 
Frank	Aaaa, it's the annual county fair. You know, aaa pie eating contests, rodeo, pig slappin, who's got the nicer cow. Bunch of ranch folk walkin around. The usual.

Leonard	I've got a gut feeling that Ms. Reynolds is there.


Powers	Looks like a caveman disco out there. alright I guess we'll check it out.

Leonard	Franklin.

Frank	You got it.

Mel	Hey hey. Hey girl. Good to see you. Yeah, you up for a little ride? Huh? Ahhh. There you go. Alright come on. (clicks tongue)

Haley	What did I tell you, this guy's a stud!

Lindsay	This is definitely going to work.
	
Mel	Whoa. You remember how to ride?

Jess	It's like riding a bicycle. Only bigger, and an animal.

Mel	Well. Ready?

Jess	Yup. (grunts)

Mel	Up! (grunts) There ya go! Well I guess we'll get you back to town.

Jess	Isn't the fair today?
 
Mel	Yeah.

Mel	I figured you needed to be gettin back.

Jess	I have some time.

Mel	My place it is then. (clicks tongue) yah.

Haley	We're so good a playing matchmaker. This is a blast!
	
Powers	Hehe, don't touch any of them. You may get mad cow disease. I don't see her anywhere.

Leonard	Oh! Maybe she knows! It's an old friend of Ms.Reynolds.
 
Delilah	You found a forever home!

Powers	Very old.

Leonard	 Excuse me!

Delilah	Oh fantastic!

Leonard	You!

Delilah	Awesome!

Leonard	Excuse me!

Delilah	Huh?

Leonard	Dear Lady, M'am.

Leonard	(short laugh) Oh, Delilah.

Delilah	Uh Huh.

Leonard	Do you remember us?

Delilah	I can't say that I do. No, cause I don't.

Leonard	Um, we came by yesterday with Jessica Reynolds to collect her dog. Have you seen her?
		
Delilah	The dog, or the girl?

Powers	The girl. We don't care about the dog.

Delilah	Yes, I saw her yesterday. I saw her with you two yesterday.

Leonard	Since yesterday.

Delilah	Since yesterday, what?


Powers	Have you seen the girl?

Delilah	Yes!

Leonard	When!?

Delilah	Yesterday!

Powers, Leonard	Yesterday!

Powers	Round up the troops!

Delilah	I saw her yesterday. I think it was yesterday.
	
Lindsay	I'm exhausted. I've never run so much in my life!

Haley	Don't be a wimp! It's great exercise.

Mel	Ha,Ha. Haley and Lindsay seem to be enjoying themselves.

Jess	They're not the only ones.
 
Mel	You coulda come back, ya know.

Jess	You could have come after me.

Mel	Look, the past is the past, right? No point in livin there.
	
	




Jess	If you say so.

Mel	You should be able to call your assistant now. I'm gonna get my stew and I'll take you back into town. I got another truck by the barn.

Lindsay	Why is she sad? I thought everything was going according to plan.

Jess	Hey, Leonard. It's me.

Haley	Come on we've gotta think of somethin! Smells good in here! Oh, I'm hungry!

Mel	mmm.

Haley	Ohhhhh so gooood
	
Mel	mmm. Now you're hungry.

Haley	Yeah, I'm always hungry.

Lindsay	How can you eat that stuff?

Haley	Easily, (chewing sound) Watch Try it. It's really good.

Lindsay	Nooo thank you.

Mel	Haley

Haley	What?

Lindsay	What are you doing?! I'm you remember!

Haley	Oooops
 
Jess	Hey, is Lindsay in there with you?

Haley	Oh, they're gonna bust us!

Mel	(breathy laugh) Right, this is gonna sound crazy, but I think..I think our little puppies are playing a trick on us.

Jess	Ok, what do you mean?

Mel	Was Lindsay at Delilah's dog park yesterday?

Jess	Yeah, for a few hours. How did you know that?

Mel	Haley was there too. They switched places. Their collars got switched.
	
Haley	We did it for a good cause.

Lindsay	Yeah, we didn't mean any harm.


Mel	Watch. Haley.

Jess	Lindsay.

Haley	Yeah

Lindsay	Hey

Jess	ohhhh.

Mel	Hum?

Jess	Ok! So, so you are Haley, and that's how you knew how to get back here.

Mel	And you're Lindsay, and that's why you spilled stew on Sally Ann last night. What if my truck breaking down, a was not an accident?

Jess	And what, the sleeping bag incident was....

Mel	(laughs)

Haley	I think it's time to make an exit. Let's go!
	
Mel	Haley!

Jess	Hey Lindsay, come on!

Haley	(panting) Come on, let's hide!

Mel	(exasperated breath)
 
Jess	So which dog is which?

Mel	Haley!

Jess	Lindsay!

Haley, Lindsay	What!

Mel	(laughs)

Jess	Oh, well nice try ladies.

Lindsay	The jig is up.

Jess	There you go.

Mel	I missed you. Yeah. Well it's gettin late. We should go. So you're gonna stick around for the a contest, or you takin off right away?


Jess	Uh, I probably have to take off pretty quickly after we figure out which dog is mine.

Mel	Haley!

Haley	You figured it out already.

Leonard	Oh, there she is! Let's go! Ms. Reynolds! We have been looking everywhere for you!
	
Jess	You know, I'm so sorry Leonard. I, I got sidetracked.

Mel	No, no it's my fault. It's my fault. I take full responsibility for it.
 
Jess	Uh, you don't need to take responsibility for it. I believe we were pawns in a certain game of manipulation.

Haley	These guys are trouble.

Lindsay	Don't listen them.

Powers	Jesse! Haha!
	
Jess	Oh my God, Powers! I, I didn't think you would fly all the way out here to...
	
Powers	To the a-armpit of America? Well when my star attraction, and the Love of my life goes missing, I leave no stone unturned.
	
Lindsay	This guy's the worst.
	
Powers	(clears throat)

Jess	Oh um, Powers, um, this is Mel, um, my good friend um Mel, this is Powers Andrews my fiance. And a this is Leonard my assistant and Franklin my driver.

Mel	It's nice to meet you guys. I would shake hands, but a...
	
Powers	Oh I wouldn't want to get my hands all dirty anyway. (laughs) Thank you so much for protecting my little sweet pea here.

Mel	She's worth protecting. You're a lucky man.

Powers	Well I believe that real men create their own luck. The secret to success is raw ambition, a lot of planning, and the right amount of financing. (laughs)
	
Mel	That's funny, cause I was referring to your upcoming wedding.

Powers	Oh! oh well of course. Yeah, same rules apply really.


Haley	I don't know what Jess sees in this guy.

Sally Ann	There you are! Come on, let's go register your stew!
	
Mel	I gotta go, Jess. Goodbye. 

Jess	Bye.

Leonard	Good luck with your stew! Well that's great because now we can catch the two- fifteen flight!

Powers	Excellent! Let's get out of the eighteen hundreds and back to modern America! Whoo. I can't wait to get home.

Jess	You know what! I want to stay and see if Mel wins the stew competition.

Powers	But stew is so gross! Why?

Jess	Because it's, uh, it's what I want. Look, coming back here has reminded me of who I was. Who I am.

Leonard	Aw.

Powers	A nobody from a dinkytown in a pathetic state filled with people whom to call them backwards would be a compliment. (laughs) Did I say something wrong? Well get after her!

Leonard	Well, uh, that wasn't in my original job description.
 
Powers	Unless you want your original job description to read permanently unemployed, you will go and get her and bring her right back here to me, both of you. Go on, scoot!
	
Lindsay	What do we do now?

Haley	Not sure, but we can't let her leave with him. Follow me!

Powers	(Heavy sigh) Shew, what is that smell?

Lindsay	Coming through, Watch out!

Haley	Coming through.

Frank	Hey, hey, the dogs!

Leonard	If we follow them they'll lead us, lead us to Ms. Reynolds. Let's go get them!

Haley	Watch your step.
	
Leonard	ohhhhh, owwww, ahh




Frank	(Laughs)

Leonard	You think it's funny!

Lindsay	Hehehe, misery loves company.

Frank	(laughs)

Leonard	Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Take that!

Haley	That went great! Come on, follow me!
 
Sally Ann	Just in time.

Mel	Yeah.

Sally Ann	Do you believe in destiny?

Mel	You know what, actually I do.

Sally Ann	Cause I think we make a really good couple together, and I think we should...

Mel	Look Sally, you're a great gal, ok. And you are going to find the right guy some day, but I'm not him. My heart belongs to someone else. It always has and always will, and I can't let her get away again. I'm sorry.
	
Powers	Jesse! I refuse to let you leave this way!

Jess	Why? Because I'm under contract?

Powers	NO, no, no, no. no, no, no, no. This is not about business. I love you.
	
Jess	Powers. Everything you do is scheduled and, planned, and jotted down. Look I got caught up in that lifestyle too, but that's not what I want anymore. I'm free here, I'm spontaneous.
 
Powers	Oh! Spontaneity! That, that's what you want! If you want spontaneity, I will give you spontaneity! We can get married right here right now today! Hum?
		
Jess	Today?

Powers	Yes. I'm sure we can find a Justice of the Peace somewhere in this windswept wasteland that can perform the ceremony.
	
Powers	(phone ringing) Hold that thought! Oh, shoot! Hello. Yeah, Hello. Hello.








Mel	Jess! Jess. Look I gotta tell you somethin. I'm sorry, ok. I was wrong. I was wrong for not supporting you. Your career, your dreams, your goals. I was selfish. I was selfish for trying to keep you here. They say if you love somethin you should set it free, not force it to stay.

Jess	What would you say if they came back?
	
Haley	Yeah!

Lindsey	We did it! We did it!

Haley	Whoohoo! We're the best!

Powers	Hey!!! Hey, hey, hey!!! That is my future wife you're kissing!
	
Jess	Ex future wife.

Powers	Oh no,no,no,no! You're mistaken! He's the ex.

Jess	Not anymore.
	
Stew Judge	Mr. Danberry! Congratulations! You're a winner.

Mel	I certainly am.

Powers	No! I am the one who always wins around here! I am the winner! So, unless you want to lose everything, uh, the car, the house, the jewelry, all of the clothes, oh and also your highly lucrative perfume contract, all those dreams, poof, up in smoke!

Jess	Powers. Look, you're confusing your dreams with mine. Everything I want is right here. I'm sorry, Powers. I'm done.
	
Leonard	Never say sorry unless you also say not sorry. Sorry, not sorry. Sorry, not sorry.

Powers	Ahh Leonard, please shut up.

Leonard	No, you shut up! Ms. Reynolds is right, you have never said one nice thing to me in all the time I've worked for you. I quit. I'm leaving you too. I do quit, I quit, I'm done.
 
Powers	Whatever!

Haley	Alright, I'm takin this guy out! (barks)

Stew Judge	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
	
Powers	Ewwww, ewwww!

Jess	How's this for closure?
	
Haley	Diamonds are a dog's best friend. Thank you!

Powers	No!

Mel	Nonononono!

Jess	No, no!

Powers	Do you know how much that ring cost me! Oh you stupid mutt! (growls) Oh, oh, oh, what about the wedding?
	
Haley	The moment we've all been waiting for. I prepared a little gem.
		
Delilah	(Deep breath)

Leonard	Extraordinary. Mel.

Delilah	Ooo, I've waited so long for this! We are gathered here today to join Jessica and Melvin... Melvin, really? Mel (whispers better) To join Jessica and Mel together in holy matrimony, and the ring in this ceremony symbolizes the never ending circle of their love, and it's, it's a, hang on it's right here. I've got it.
 
Lindsey	I'm so proud!

Haley	It was a team effort sis!

Lindsay	I just wish that they didn't waste all that pie. hum, I'm so hungry!

Delilah	I know I have the ring. I know..Wait a minute,I had the ring, I bent down, I patted the dogs..eh, oh no!
	
Jess, Mel	(laugh)

Delilah	Oh I'm sorry.

Haley	Oh you didn't, not again?!

Jess	Lindsay!

Lindsay	Why is everyone looking at me?

Haley	You know you're supposed to wear diamonds, not eat them.

Lindsay	It was tasty.



Delilah	Well, we'll get it back very fast. You can't kiss yet! Gotta retrieve the..uh..ring.
	
Lindsay	Here we go again.

Mel	I love you.

Jess	I love you too.
 
Powers	(gagging) Oh God. I'm going to get eaten alive by some redneck. Oh God. Oh, oh, oh, (whining) Oh shew. Whoo,hehe! Hi! Well, well, well. You going my way sweetheart?
	
Sally Ann	(laughs) I can do so much better.

Powers	No you can't! No one can do better than me! I'm the best!
