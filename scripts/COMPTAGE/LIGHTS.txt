(LIGHTS, CAMERA, ROMANCE)





 

ALBERT	Do you like it?

EMMA	Of course I do. I love it.

ALBERT	Every moment I spent painting it, I thought of you.

EMMA	I didn't think you would finish it. I expected you would have thrown it away.

ALBERT	Never. It is forever tied to the woman I love.

DIRECTOR	Cut! Beautiful. Thank you, Emma, Albert. Nicely done. That's a wrap, everyone!

EMMA	Thanks, Albert.

ALBERT	Wonderful working with you, Emma.

DIRECTOR	Emma, fabulous. Such a pleasure, the whole film, truly.

EMMA	I feel the same way! I'm so excited to see it.

DIRECTOR	We'll talk soon!

ZANE ELTON	Your best work yet.

EMMA	Thanks, Zane; you're sweet but it's nothing I haven't done before. Have you heard of anything else coming up? My schedule is a little too clear for my liking.

ZANE ELTON	A break isn't a bad thing.

EMMA	I just want to keep busy. Maybe do something different? Oh. Well, word is Clyde Romano is doing a new film. Big budget	 theatrical. Oh I love Clyde! He was so great to work with. What is it?

ZANE ELTON	(dismissive)Some fantasy action adventure.

EMMA	Seriously? That would be perfect!

ZANE ELTON	But Emma, it's not what people know you for—

EMMA	Exactly! Come on, you're my agent. See what you can find out.

KYLIE	Emma, thanks again! I don't know how you knew we'd be perfect for each other.

EMMA	I could just tell.

ZANE ELTON	What was that?

EMMA	The props master and the camera assistant. I paired them up.

ZANE ELTON	Oh. They do look happy.

EMMA	So, you'll call Clyde? Please?

ZANE ELTON	Anything for you.

LIZ	You are kidding.

ELINOR	This is beyond what I expected of him. Despite our differences, I have always tried to respect him.

LIZ	So much for that.

EMMA	What? Everything okay at your dance studio?

LIZ	I'm fine, but Elinor's stepbrother fired her from the family company.

EMMA	No! Can he do that?

ELINOR	He did it.

EMMA	But your stepdad wouldn't ever agree. You're too valuable there!
	
LIZ	He doesn't know.

ELINOR	He's in semi-retirement anyway. I don't want to be responsible for dragging him into this mess.

EMMA	You can't let this go without a fight.

ELINOR	Ugh, you sound like Liz.

LIZ	That's because I'm right.

EMMA	Did he give any reason?

ELINOR	(beat) Budget cuts.

EMMA	You're their internal auditor—

LIZ	Exactly. It makes no sense. Or it makes perfect sense. He's trying to hide something.

ELINOR	I'm sure he's....

LIZ	Don't defend him.

ELINOR	He must have his reasons.

EMMA	I'm so sorry.

LIZ	Maybe you should stage a coup.

GRAY	Did you all order yet?

EMMA	I don't know--have we?

LIZ	Yeah, the usual. (beat) Elinor got fired. By her own brother.

ELINOR	Step brother.

GRAY	Sorry, Elinor. Anything I can do?

LIZ	Represent her in a lawsuit for wrongful -- what do you call it?

GRAY	Wrongful termination.

ELINOR	Thank you, but I'm still figuring it out. No lawsuit needed. Let's focus on something better. Less stressful.

GRAY	How'd the filming go?

EMMA	All done. Oh! My agent told me about this new project coming up, totally different from what I normally do.

LIZ	No romance?

EMMA	I assume not, but I haven't seen the script yet. It's action, fantasy, something like that.

GRAY	Closer to my kind of movie. Not that I don't love your work.

EMMA	Nice save. Anyway, I'll have to keep busy till that's arranged. 
 
LIZ	Uh oh. 

EMMA	What?
LIZ	A bored Emma is a dangerous Emma.

EMMA	What?

ELINOR	You tend to latch onto ... projects when you have nothing to do. Like, setting people up.

EMMA	Not all the time. I can't help that I'm good at it.

GRAY	Remember setting me up with ... Daphne? Darby?

EMMA	That was a big misunderstanding.

GRAY	I'll say.

EMMA	Either way, turning my back on someone else's potential happiness is just wrong, so I'll help where I can. Like my agent--he said something today that got me thinking he'd love to find his soulmate.

GRAY	Oh boy.

EMMA	Come on. I've actually never set him up before. It'll be good.

LIZ	All I can say is—"Not it."

ELINOR	Not it!

EMMA	Are you okay? Need a hand?

HOPE MURPHY	Oh, thanks! I think I have it—

EMMA	Here—

HOPE MURPHY	Thanks. I'm Hope, Hope Murphy. I just rented this house.

EMMA	I'm Emma. You'll really like the neighborhood.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh, good! (gasps) You're Emma Hutton! The actress!

EMMA	(surprised) Ah, yes.

HOPE MURPHY	I love your movies!	 I've seen them all, and I have most of them in one of these boxes.	
 
EMMA	Oh! That's so nice to hear.

HOPE MURPHY	Sorry. That sounds funny out loud. You must get strange fans all the time.

EMMA	Not really.
	
HOPE MURPHY	Just me then.

EMMA	So, what brought you here?

HOPE MURPHY	I'm starting a new job.

EMMA	Oh, what do you do?

HOPE MURPHY	I'm a dentist. A practice nearby hired me on. I'm lucky I found this place.

EMMA	That's wonderful. Is it just you?

HOPE MURPHY	Yep.

EMMA	You sure you don't want help?

HOPE MURPHY	Oh, no, you're sweet. Thank you though.

EMMA	Well, I'll let you finish.

HOPE MURPHY	Okay. Great to meet you!

EMMA	And you.

HOPE MURPHY	(under her breath)... Embarrassing...

EMMA	Come on.....

HOPE MURPHY	Emma! Hi!

EMMA	Hi Hope. Sorry, it's a bit early, but I am out of milk and am in the middle of making something. Could I—

HOPE MURPHY	Sure, how much do you need?

EMMA	A cup if you have it to spare.

HOPE MURPHY	Of course. Hang on--Here you go.

EMMA	Thank you so much.

HOPE MURPHY	No problem.

EMMA	Why don't you come over and have a bite when it's ready? I literally wouldn't be able to make this without your help.

HOPE MURPHY	Thanks, I'd like that.

EMMA	Give me 20 minutes or so. See you soon! Zane! Come in.

ZANE ELTON	Smells good.

EMMA	Come try some.

ZANE ELTON	I got a hold of Clyde Romano. He says he and the studio are already thinking of a few other actresses. Some who are more... established in the genre.

EMMA	Established?!

ZANE ELTON	(trying to phrase and flatter) Someone more in the big studio, epic movie space.
	
EMMA	But didn't you tell him I'm interested? Call him; tell him it'd be such a creative move to cast against type, someone fresh who's not always in the blockbusters. I can do it, I know I can.

ZANE ELTON	You haven't read the script. I haven't either for that matter.

EMMA	That's perfect! Use that to call him back and ask for it. Tell him I'd love to audition for him. He has to consider me. That's Hope.

HOPE MURPHY	Hi! I brought some orange juice.

EMMA	Oh that's so nice! You already bailed me out with the milk. Come in. My agent just stopped by. Zane, this is my neighbor, Hope.

ZANE ELTON	Happy to meet you. (to Emma) Sorry, I should leave you to your plans.

EMMA	No, stay. I have plenty.

ZANE ELTON	I thought I knew all of Emma's friends.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh, I'm new -I just moved in.

ZANE ELTON	Great! You can't ask for a better friend than Emma.

HOPE MURPHY	She's been so kind to me already.

ZANE ELTON	(glances to Emma) You must deserve it. I love to say Emma can judge good character in anyone she meets.

EMMA	Don't you want to try something on?
	
ELINOR	I can't afford to buy right now anyway.
	
EMMA	My treat?
	
ELINOR	Thanks, but no. What I could use is your help. Will you look over my résumé?	
 
EMMA	I'm not sure I'm the best to do this. My résumé is a list of movies and characters, not skills like--(gesturing to the paper)--"Proficient in managing a team of 7 accountants," or "implemented a critical component in auditing transactional data."

ELINOR	Then, look for typos.

EMMA	That I can do.

ELINOR	The thing no one is going to look past is that I was fired by my own family.

EMMA	A bully in the family.
	
ELINOR	I can't quite explain it away without sounding bitter and unreasonable.

EMMA	You could say you decided to leave, that you were ready for something new?

ELINOR	What do I do for a reference when they call my stepbrother?

EMMA	Put your stepfather down as a reference instead.

ELINOR	Then he'll know I got fired the minute someone calls him.
 
EMMA	(beat) Why don't you want to tell him?

ELINOR	Because he'll get upset about it and then my mom will get upset and I just--I just want to move on.

EMMA	They'll find out at some point.

ELINOR	Yes, but that can happen when I'm over it and better off. So—

EMMA	Okay. It would be easier if you had other companies that you worked for more recently but...

ELINOR	I worked for my stepfather's company for years. (sighs) So I need something else to put here. Something to take the negative attention away.

EMMA	That looks too intense to be one of my contracts.
 
GRAY	No, your acting contracts are thankfully much simpler. This is four versions of an endorsement deal. Somewhere along the way the terms got mixed and mingled and it's not even close to what it's supposed to be. What's up?

EMMA	Elinor. I thought you'd be better suited to looking at her résumé.

GRAY	Sure.

EMMA	She's so worried about her experience. I think she just needs something soon to calm her down. Boost her confidence.

GRAY	Yeah.

EMMA	It's unfortunate I can't hire her for some movie, you know? I wish I could.

GRAY	You want me to see if there's a job here for her.

EMMA	You see right through me.
 
GRAY	Subtlety is not one of your strengths. I have no idea what openings are even at the firm.

EMMA	What about something temporary?

GRAY	Maybe....

EMMA	You know how organized she is. Even if it's not something she has done before, she can do it.

GRAY	Let me look into it. Can I keep this?

EMMA	Yes! Thank you.

GRAY	All right, all right. Enough of that.

EMMA	Hi!

HOPE MURPHY	Oh, hi, Emma!

EMMA	Did you start work today?

HOPE MURPHY	No, tomorrow.

EMMA	Good, more time for you to settle in. (beat) I was glad you could meet Zane.

HOPE MURPHY	Me too, he was very nice.

EMMA	Very nice?

HOPE MURPHY	Yeah.

EMMA	I think you two got along well.

HOPE MURPHY	You do? Did he say anything?

EMMA	He didn't have to.

HOPE MURPHY	Tell me about him.

EMMA	A party?

GRAY	It's ridiculous.

EMMA	Oh? What's the occasion?

GRAY	Bell, the firm's managing partner,	 is celebrating the hiring of his lackluster son, who finally got around to passing the bar. He's being made Junior Partner right out of law school. Guess which nice office he got?

EMMA	The best one in the building?

GRAY	Second best. Bell himself has the first.	Nepotism at its finest.

EMMA	At least it will be a nice party. Formal, catered—

GRAY	Expensive. These things are purely for the Bell family ego.

EMMA	Sorry.

GRAY	It does come with one upside.

EMMA	What?

GRAY	I was venting about it to June in Billing, and she started venting back about how much waste there is in the firm.	Frivolous spending, unaccounted expenses, billing errors because of partner idiocies--so she's hiring someone to come in and find all the areas to trim back and reconcile. And I recommended—

EMMA	Elinor!

GRAY	Yes. June should email her soon about it.

EMMA	You are the best.

GRAY	It's just temporary at this point, but—

EMMA	It's perfect. Thank you.

GRAY	My pleasure. But I need a favor too.

EMMA	Sure.

GRAY	I don't want to be pestered and I need a date for this-- (waves the invitation around) --so will you go with me?

EMMA	Of course.

GRAY	Thank you.

EMMA	It's Zane. He got the script and wants me to stop by his office to pick it up.

GRAY	For that big studio movie you want to do?
	
EMMA	Yes! I'll swing by my place and get Hope to come with me.

GRAY	What? Who's Hope?

EMMA	My new neighbor, who I think Zane is already eying.

GRAY	Oh no....

EMMA	Oh yes.

GRAY	Zane's office is just around the corner from here. Why go back to your house?


EMMA	So he can see Hope again. A little extra travel time for me is worth it if it means true love for someone else.

GRAY	Of course. Silly me.

ZANE ELTON	I'll push them to move back your filming dates, but I can't promise anything. Take care now. Bye bye. You couldn't wait to see me, could you?

EMMA	Hope and I were in the neighborhood.

ZANE ELTON	Fantastic.

EMMA	I'll read this as soon as I get home. When's the audition?

ZANE ELTON	I'm working on that.

EMMA	My schedule is open.

ZANE ELTON	I am whittling down Clyde and the casting director, I promise.

EMMA	All right. Thanks. I'm going to grab a drink of water real quick, but Hope wants to find out more about you and what you do.

ZANE ELTON	Fire away. (beat)

HOPE MURPHY	How long have you been Emma's agent?

ZANE ELTON	Three years.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh. Great. Do you like the entertainment field?

ZANE ELTON	She was brilliant, totally unafraid even if she was dressed in a gorilla suit. Emma, remember that gorilla costume you had to wear?

EMMA	Oh yes. What movie was that for?

HOPE MURPHY	I think that was the flower shop one.

ZANE ELTON	That's it. Very random but you nailed it. Oh, excuse me.

EMMA	We'll let you get back to it then.

ZANE ELTON	Thanks for stopping by.

HOPE MURPHY	Good to see you again.

ZANE ELTON	(answering) Zane Elton.

EMMA	He's funny, isn't he?

HOPE MURPHY	I nearly panicked when you left me on my own, but then he started telling stories about you, and it got better.

EMMA	See?

HOPE MURPHY	He made me feel at ease.

EMMA	Oh good! He relates to people well. I guess it's his job. (beat) So maybe you should spend more time with him. Like, go out with him.

HOPE MURPHY	No, I couldn't.

EMMA	Why not? Do you have a boyfriend?

HOPE MURPHY	No, but -- I hardly know him.

EMMA	That's why you go out.

HOPE MURPHY	I barely had enough to say with you out of the room for a few minutes. It'd be awkward and I don't do well when things are awkward.
 
EMMA	Whoa, you're worrying for nothing. I can tell you'd be fine.

HOPE MURPHY	(firmly) I can't ask him out.

EMMA	I can set you two up then.

HOPE MURPHY	It'd still be awkward.

EMMA	I think you could make Zane happy, and he can make you happy too. So, what would it take?

HOPE MURPHY	Make it a double date. It takes the pressure off.

EMMA	Okay. Done.

LIZ	Everyone, line up. Let's see your best, please.

ELINOR	Have you considered maybe Hope doesn't want a relationship right now?

EMMA	It's just a date.
 
ELINOR	But she moved into a new place, with a new job. It's a lot of change.

EMMA	Is this your way of telling me I shouldn't set her up?

ELINOR	Be careful--that's all.

EMMA	It'll be fine. You should see how good they look together.

ELINOR	Have you figured out who you're going to ask for your date?

EMMA	Not yet. I really don't want to go but I understand Hope's anxious, so I'll be there.

ELINOR	Make sure it's not someone you're too interested in because then you're distracted with your date, and if she needs you—

EMMA	Good thinking. It's not really a problem though.

ELINOR	No suitable men in your contact list?

LIZ	Okay, well done! I will see you next time. What'd I miss?

ELINOR	Emma is looking for a guy for a double date she's going on.

LIZ	What about Baker Caulfield?

EMMA	Ew. No.

LIZ	You set him up with me!

EMMA	I did?

LIZ	True friendship, right here. You threw a guy at me who wasn't even good enough for yourself.

EMMA	This would be much easier if you two had available brothers.

LIZ	I only have four sisters of varying degrees of respectability. Trust me, my dad wishes he'd had a son somewhere along the way.

ELINOR	And I value our friendship too much to recommend my stepbrother, even if he wasn't married. Huh.

EMMA	What?

ELINOR	It's an email from the lady I interviewed with at Gray's firm. They want me to consult! I'm to "evaluate, and recommend cost- saving measures" for the firm.

LIZ	That's perfect!

EMMA	Congrats, Elinor!

LIZ	(still mid-hug) Okay, I'm starving. Can we go?

EMMA	Zane, the script is-- I want the part. I have to have it. Have you read it? It's everything I've wanted to do, all in one character. Oh. Sorry, the time got away from me. We can chat tomorrow. (beat) Oh! Before I let you go, set aside Friday night. We're going out--a double date. You, Hope, me.	She's new in town and could use fantastic company and a night out. (beat) Okay, great. Good night! This character doesn't back down but she's full of these insecurities, and it's delightful. And then she's this epic hero even though she's flawed, and--it's so complex and I love it. (beat) I think I've waited my whole career—

GRAY	All 8 years of it?

EMMA	That's just the years I started getting paid. I acted long before that. But this is what I've wanted, maybe without realizing it till now.

GRAY	Well, may Zane work his tail off to get you the audition.

EMMA	Did you ever think I'd be a serious actress?

GRAY	Ever? You are one now.

EMMA	Like when we were younger. My father always indulged acting but I don't think he saw it as a career.

GRAY	There was a play you were in when I started law school. I think it was Romeo and Juliet, and you know how I feel about romances.

EMMA	It's a tragic romance. Isn't that better?

GRAY	No. But I came opening night, because I knew I'd never hear the end of it from your father or my parents if I didn't. (searching his memory) I remember the castle set fell apart.

EMMA	Yes.

GRAY	Everyone was running around like someone just walked in on them in the shower. Not you though. You --somehow -- stayed in character, helped put the set piece back together, and kept going. That's when I knew.

EMMA	Thank you. Is Elinor here today?

GRAY	Yes, she signed with HR this morning. We should call her in. There's enough food.

EMMA	Are you kidding? She has very strict thoughts about breaks and ... talking at work.

GRAY	Really?

EMMA	"110% at work" is her motto.

GRAY	Guess I should set a better example. Thanks for lunch.

EMMA	Of course. I do have a favor.

GRAY	Another one?

EMMA	Oh stop it. It's not that bad.

GRAY	What is it?

EMMA	Since I'm your plus-one for your company party—

GRAY	(grumbles) Over indulgent party—

EMMA	Can you be mine for this double date I set up for Zane and Hope?

GRAY	Is it worse to be on a first date or witness someone else's?

EMMA	Stop. They already know each other.

GRAY	A little.

EMMA	Will you come?

GRAY	Fine. Nice to meet you, Hope. I've heard a lot about you from Emma.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh, thank you!

ZANE ELTON	Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

EMMA	Zane, you know Gray, my attorney?

ZANE ELTON	Of course. Good to see you again.

HOPE MURPHY	Hi Zane. 

ZANE ELTON	Hope.

EMMA	Should we sit?

GRAY	Thank you.

EMMA	Thanks. (to Gray) I'm going to powder my nose real quick. Will you order the fish for me please?

GRAY	Sure.

HOPE MURPHY	Uh, I'll come with you.

EMMA	Do you know what you want to order too?

HOPE MURPHY	Oh. (to Zane) The fish for me also. Thanks.

GRAY	Everything all right?

ZANE ELTON	Sure. So are you and Emma ... dating?

GRAY	Ah, no. It's just a favor, is all.

ZANE ELTON	That makes more sense. I thought you were just the lawyer and nothing more, so... good.

GRAY	Well, we've been friends for years, before I went into law.

ZANE ELTON	Oh. She never mentioned that.

GRAY	Hope seems nice.

ZANE ELTON	If you like that type.

GRAY	Hey.

ELINOR	Hi! Thanks so much for your help. This job is just what I needed.

GRAY	Good, good.

ELINOR	What's up?

GRAY	I-- I'm 95% certain that the guy Emma's setting up with her friend is actually in love with Emma.

ELINOR	Zane, the agent?

GRAY	Do I warn her?

ELINOR	Poor Hope. I don't know.

GRAY	I mean Emma.

ELINOR	What if you're wrong?

GRAY	If I picked up on it, doesn't that say something?

ELINOR	I see your point. How is Emma missing it then?

GRAY	Seriously? Emma is in her own world when it comes to romance. She sees it completely different from reality.

ELINOR	Warn her then. But, tell her you're not sure, just in case, you know—

GRAY	Yeah. But I'm not wrong. (beat) Thanks.

EMMA	(on phone) You are a miracle worker. I will be there tomorrow. Thank you, Zane!

HOPE MURPHY	What happened? (to Dental Receptionist) Are these the prescription authorizations?

EMMA	Zane got me the audition.

HOPE MURPHY	That's so great!

EMMA	Thank you. Oh! I should have asked Zane what he thought of the date.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh no, don't do that.

EMMA	How do you think it went?

HOPE MURPHY	Good. I always feel awkward, so I'm glad you were there.

EMMA	Next time though, you should go just the two of you.

HOPE MURPHY	If there's a next time.

EMMA	I saw the way he smiled at you, and you talked as if you had a lot in common. There will be a next time. My offer to call him back still stands.

HOPE MURPHY	No no no. That's too much.

EMMA	How about this? I'll be talking to him anyway about the audition, so I can carefully, subtly learn how he feels and imply you would love to go out again?
 
HOPE MURPHY	Perfect.

EMMA	Where should we go for lunch? (words can drop in and out with her mumbling) "If we fail now, we never recover.	" "We never return to any happiness or peace, which many of us fought for since we were children. " If we fail now, we never recover. We'll never return to the peace--Return to any happiness or peace, which we fought for since—Hi!
 
GRAY	Memorizing lines?

EMMA	Trying.

GRAY	When's the audition.

EMMA	10am.

GRAY	You'll do great.

EMMA	You always say that.

GRAY	Doesn't mean I don't believe it.

EMMA	Line check, no emotion.

GRAY	Got it. Go.

EMMA	"If we fail now, we never recover. We never return to any happiness or peace, which we fought for since we were children." (beat) Ummm.... "We'll retreat. We have to.	 Not for ourselves but our villages	 near and far. We must survive for them." How am I doing so far?

GRAY	80%?

EMMA	Ugh. How was your day?

GRAY	Fine.

EMMA	I never thanked you for coming with me the other night.

GRAY	No thanks needed. But about that...
 
EMMA	What?

GRAY	I noticed that Zane seemed...Nevermind.

EMMA	Wait, I'm listening. I need a break anyway. You were saying?

GRAY	Okay. At dinner, I kept noticing... I got the feeling, repeatedly, that Zane...

EMMA	What about him?

GRAY	He's into you.

EMMA	What? That's ridiculous.

GRAY	Not really.

EMMA	He's my agent.

GRAY	He wants to be more than that.

EMMA	He was there on a date with Hope—

GRAY	But he addressed you every time he said something. Not her.

EMMA	Gray, I think you're reading too much into it.

GRAY	I'm not. You love to play Cupid but that doesn't mean you are right all the time.

EMMA	Hope likes Zane.

GRAY	And that's great. But I'm warning you that it's not mutual.

EMMA	Well, I don't believe it.

GRAY	Then you're in denial.

EMMA	Come on, I would have noticed if what you're saying is true.

GRAY	You don't notice anything if it means you're wrong.

EMMA	(playfully upset) Hey! I appreciate your concern. But I'm not wrong.

GRAY	Fine. From the beginning?
 

ZANE ELTON	Hey. Clyde is running behind. The	 casting director said it'll be just a few more minutes.

EMMA	Okay. I didn't expect you here.

ZANE ELTON	I know how important this is to you. How are you feeling?

EMMA	Ready.

ZANE ELTON	Good.

EMMA	Thanks again, for getting me this chance.

ZANE ELTON	You're my star. And you deserve it.

SHELLEY	Clyde’s just about ready.

EMMA	Thank you. I’m so nervous.

ZANE ELTON	You got this. You'll be fine.

EMMA	Thanks.

ZANE ELTON	What?

EMMA	Zane-- I....

ZANE ELTON	I love you.

EMMA	You do?

ZANE ELTON	Didn't you know?

EMMA	But Hope—

ZANE ELTON	What about her?

EMMA	The date—

ZANE ELTON	I thought you had asked me out as your date, until I realized you were there with Gray and that Hope was supposed to be my date. So I went with it.

EMMA	We've never –

ZANE ELTON	I know, and that's why I want to be clear now. No more sideways glances, setting each other up when really we want to be together. I love you. Emma?

SHELLEY	We're ready for you now.
	
EMMA	(to Zane) I have to go do this.

ZANE ELTON	Emma....

EMMA	Zane, don't ....I'm sorry. I've never thought of you that way.

ZANE ELTON	But you could.

SHELLEY	Emma?

EMMA	Yes, coming.

CLYDE ROMANO	Good to see you again.
	
EMMA	You too. Thank you for letting me audition.

CLYDE ROMANO	Whenever you are ready. Shelley will	 read opposite you.

EMMA	If we fail now, we never recover. We never return to any happiness or peace, which many of us fought for since we were children.

SHELLEY	What can we do? You are to lead us, aren't you? Tell us.

EMMA	We retreat.
	
SHELLEY	Retreat?!
	
EMMA	We must. Not for our own lives but for those of every village near and far. We must survive for them.
	
SHELLEY	What difference will it make? Whether we die today or in another battle?
	
EMMA	I was so wrong.

GRAY	I'm trying very hard not to say, "I told you--"

EMMA	Good. Keep trying. (beat) I really had no idea he liked me.

GRAY	(sincerely) I know.

EMMA	And poor Hope. She'll ... there's no way around her getting hurt, is there? Then tack on the audition. (scoffs bitterly) Disaster.

GRAY	It couldn't have been that bad.

EMMA	The casting director only said "Thanks for coming by" when I finished. No comment on the performance, no "let's try it this way" from Clyde, not even a "great to see you again." (beat) I should have listened to you.

GRAY	Come here. It's not as if you wanted this to happen. You were trying to make Zane and Hope happy.

EMMA	Trying and failing.

GRAY	Failure every now and then is healthy. It helps us grow.

EMMA	Did you just make that up?

GRAY	No.

EMMA	Still, the worst is still to come.

GRAY	What?

EMMA	Telling Hope.

HOPE MURPHY	Hi! I came as soon as I got off work. What's up?

EMMA	I was wrong about Zane. I never would have recommended him if I'd known. And the last thing I want is for you to get hurt.

HOPE MURPHY	I know.

EMMA	You do?

HOPE MURPHY	Can I ask you something?

EMMA	Of course.

HOPE MURPHY	Now that you know he's interested in you, do you want to date him?

EMMA	No. Are you -- how are you feeling? Feel free to yell and throw things.

HOPE MURPHY	You really can't think so little of me. I barely knew him.

EMMA	It's completely understandable being angry though—

HOPE MURPHY	I'm not. Sure, it stings a bit, being rejected but.... honestly, I had more fun on the date just joking around and talking with you, Gray and Zane. It's not like I had my heart firmly set on him. (beat) We tried. It didn't work out. No big deal. What's in these cookies? They're really good.

LIZ	She's a saint. I was furious at you when you set me up with Neon Jacket guy.

EMMA	You both would like her. We need to all get together. I imagine she's still trying to feel comfortable here, not so alone.

ELINOR	I'm glad you're considering a supportive group of friends now, instead of a date.

EMMA	(beat)	Well, I'm not giving up on her—

LIZ	(groans) Emma, come on. Give the girl a break. Besides, weren't you originally trying to set up Zane?

EMMA	Yes but he's not taking my calls, so I think that's out.

LIZ	This one?

EMMA	Not for an office party.

ELINOR	Maybe you should give Hope time to just be herself.

LIZ	Yeah, stop pressuring her to find romance.

EMMA	I'm not pressuring her—

LIZ	You're worse than my mother.

EMMA	I take offense to that.

LIZ	You'll get over it.

ELINOR	(smoothing things over) I think what Liz means is there is nothing wrong with letting romance develop on its own. Without any well- meaning nudges.

EMMA	Not that one. (beat) I don't want Hope to think I'm giving up on her.

LIZ	You're not.

EMMA	And I do enjoy trying to match people up.

LIZ	Then why not stick to finding someone for yourself?

EMMA	That's like me being a surgeon trying to operate on myself. Oh—

ELINOR	I like that one.

LIZ	If you must, find someone for my sister Lydia. She'd swoon over anyone you set her up with, especially if they were "famous."

EMMA	You could smile. It might shock someone, which could be amusing.

GRAY	No, it might lure someone over here.

EMMA	If you dread it so much, why'd you come?

GRAY	Obligation. Bell notices. I think he has his secretary taking roll.

EMMA	At least he doesn't ignore you.

GRAY	Who's ignoring you? That director?

EMMA	No. Zane.

GRAY	You called him?

EMMA	Yeah. He never picks up. I want to know about the audition, but that seems awkward too.

GRAY	There's too much that's not been said yet.
 
EMMA	Yes. But I don't want to make things worse.

GRAY	You can't avoid each other forever. At some point, you have to work with him again.

EMMA	I know. I wish I'd ... noticed how he felt. What if I did something to encourage him without realizing it?

GRAY	You can be a bit of a flirt. Have you been by his office?

EMMA	No.
	
GRAY	You should go there. Smooth things over. It might make him feel better. (beat) And you. Time to try out the overpriced hor dourves. Want some?

EMMA	Sure.

GRAY	Be right back.

BARRY BELL	What's amusing you? Oh. He got snagged by my father. Poor guy.

EMMA	That's your father?

BARRY BELL	You must not work for the firm. Barry Bell.

EMMA	Ah, the newly hired partner. Emma Hutton.

BARRY BELL	Pleasure to meet you. I noticed you didn't throw out I'm the undeserving "son," a tribute to "nepotism." I hear the office rumor mill.

EMMA	Is being the newest partner—

BARRY BELL	Junior partner.

EMMA	--Is it everything you imagined?

BARRY BELL	It's okay. It's work. What about you? You don't work here but are you a lawyer?

EMMA	No. I've only played one before in a movie.

BARRY BELL	An actress then! Fascinating. What films have you done?

EMMA	Mainly romantic, love-story movies.	
 
BARRY BELL	How fun! I don't know if I recognized you or not, but when I saw you I had to come meet you. So what are you working on right now?

EMMA	(hesitates) I just finished one project, and I'm hoping to hear about one in particular soon.

BARRY BELL	You know, I have always wanted to act. You hear that all the time.

EMMA	I do.

BARRY BELL	Sorry. It's true though. But is it everything I imagine it would be?

EMMA	At times, yes.

BARRY BELL	And others?

EMMA	It's still work. Good times and bad. Stressful. I love it though.

BARRY BELL	Tell me about the bad. If I consider a career change, I want to know what I'm getting into.

EMMA	Long hours. Working with new people all the time, some good, some a little odd. Oh, speaking of odd, fans—not that I have tons but there's always a handful who can be a little out there.	

BARRY BELL	You can't blame them for being wild about you.

EMMA	You said to stick to finding someone for myself. Who knew he'd come to me?

LIZ	But Barry Bell? Is that really his name?

EMMA	Yes, and he was nice.

LIZ	I thought Gray didn't think much of him.

EMMA	I get why--Barry has the family connection, and Gray's worked hard to get where he is. But it doesn't mean Barry's a bad guy.

LIZ	You're... serious about him. (downplaying) I think he's worth getting to know better. So are you going to call him?

EMMA	I can't. I don't have his number, but he asked for mine.

LIZ	So you have to wait. Your favorite thing.

EMMA	It's worse than waiting to hear about an audition. Almost.

LIZ	Oh, any word on that role you wanted?

EMMA	Not yet.

ZANE ELTON	I haven't heard about the audition.

EMMA	How are you?

ZANE ELTON	Fine.

EMMA	Are you redecorating?

ZANE ELTON	Yes. The agency had a meeting and is shuffling assignments. I've been assigned other people to represent, and a new agent, Cathy, will now represent you.

EMMA	Oh.

ZANE ELTON	She's good. I'll tell her to pass on any updates from Clyde Romano.

EMMA	Thanks. (beat) I didn't know. If I had, I	I would never mislead you.

ZANE ELTON	I'm sorry, but I need to focus on this deal I'm putting together for another actor.

EMMA	(beat) Okay.(beat) Bye, Zane.

ZANE ELTON	Goodbye, Emma.
	
BARRY BELL	Emma! I hope I didn't keep you waiting. Well, I was hoping you'd let me take you out. How's tonight then? (beat) I'll meet you there.

EMMA	I need your help.

HOPE MURPHY	Mine? For what?
	
EMMA	I have a date tonight. What do you think?

HOPE MURPHY	Who is your date?

EMMA	This lawyer I met at Gray's firm. It's just what I need right now.

HOPE MURPHY	A distraction?

EMMA	Romance.

HOPE MURPHY	I like the color of this one.

EMMA	Good. Any others?

HOPE MURPHY	Let's see....

EMMA	Am I being insensitive about this?

HOPE MURPHY	What do you mean?

EMMA	I mean, with how Zane turned out, and now I'm going on a date.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh please-- (waves it off) I'm fine. Don't hold back.

EMMA	All right. Maybe I should go more casually? Let me grab a few other options.

HOPE MURPHY	So you said your date's a friend of Gray's?

EMMA	Not really. They work in the same firm now but I don't think Gray knows him that well.

HOPE MURPHY	How do you and Gray know each other?

EMMA	We grew up in the same neighborhood. Our parents were good friends. He's a bit older than I am so we weren't in school together, but it became inevitable with our families that we'd interact. He's been a good friend, a trusted friend. (beat) I guess that's why he's my attorney too.

HOPE MURPHY	What does he do?

EMMA	Oh, contracts for my acting jobs, and all that. Making sure I'm not signing something I shouldn't.

HOPE MURPHY	He was very nice, I thought.

EMMA	(distracted) Yes, he is.

HOPE MURPHY	Do you have a blouse to go with this? I like it better than the dress.

EMMA	Hmm. Yes. Hello? (beat) Oh hi. Nice to hear from you. (beat; excited) Really? They did? That's amazing! Oh thank you! Okay, I'll be ready. Bye!

HOPE MURPHY	What was that?

EMMA	My new agent. I'm wanted for a camera test!

HOPE MURPHY	What's a—

EMMA	It's like another audition, usually more in depth, and they film it to see how I look on camera. This is	 fantastic; I thought I'd ruined my chances before.

HOPE MURPHY	I'm so happy for you!

EMMA	Thank you! I had to cut my hair just to get free.

BARRY BELL	No!

EMMA	It was a mess, and it changed my look in the middle of the show. I thought for sure I'd ruined the whole movie right then.

BARRY BELL	Did you get in trouble?

EMMA	Thankfully no, but I think that's only because the director could tell it wasn't my fault. One wig later, and I got through it.

BARRY BELL	I'd always heard acting is dramatic but that....

EMMA	Not what you'd expect.

BARRY BELL	If it makes you feel better, I watched that very movie last night and couldn't tell.

EMMA	Good.

BARRY BELL	You really are quite talented.

EMMA	Thank you.

BARRY BELL	I'd love to see you work sometime.

EMMA	I'd like that. (beat) Hopefully this camera test leads somewhere.

BARRY BELL	When is it?

EMMA	Tomorrow.

BARRY BELL	So soon?

EMMA	Yeah.

BARRY BELL	That's a lot of pressure.

EMMA	You get used to it.

BARRY BELL	Do you need help, or moral support, or anything I can do?

EMMA	Oh, thank you. I should be fine, aside from the normal nerves.

BARRY BELL	Let me come with you then.

 
EMMA	They don't let you in to watch.

BARRY BELL	I'll wait in the lobby or whatever. I want to be there.

EMMA	Okay. Thanks.

BARRY BELL	So how did you get into acting? Sorry,	 I'm bombarding you with questions, aren't I?

EMMA	Maybe you're channeling your inner lawyer. Is this a cross-examination?

BARRY BELL	(chuckles) I haven't been in court yet.

EMMA	I feel like I'm always talking about my work. Tell me about you more.

BARRY BELL	No, I love hearing about what you do. Promise. Now, tell me how you trained to become such a great actress.

SHELLEY	Emma, hi.

EMMA	Hi, good to see you again.

SHELLEY	Have a seat, and we'll call you back in a minute.

EMMA	Thank you.

SHELLEY	They're ready for you.

BARRY BELL	(whispering) Are they the competition?

EMMA	Shhhh. Maybe, but they could be here for another role. Are you nervous?

BARRY BELL	Yes! Isn't that crazy? How do you do this?

EMMA	It's just like a job interview.

BARRY BELL	I work for my father. The interview got skipped. So what happens when it's your turn?

EMMA	They'll lead me to a studio and someone will read the lines of the other characters while I act out my part.

BARRY BELL	That's it?

EMMA	Hopefully there's some chance to talk, make a personal impression too.

SHELLEY	Emma?

BARRY BELL	Break a leg!

CLYDE ROMANO	Emma. Good to see you again.

EMMA	Thank you for giving me another chance.

CLYDE ROMANO	It took some convincing of some higher ups.

EMMA	Higher ups?

CLYDE ROMANO	Studio big wigs. Here they come—

EMMA	Oh.



CLYDE ROMANO	Don't worry about it. I saw something in your audition that I didn't expect. The way you were so conflicted--it was just eye-opening.

EMMA	(trying to hide the surprise) I'm glad you liked it.

CLYDE ROMANO	Maybe this character could be fresh, not the confident, we-know-she'll- win hero, but someone vulnerable, who grows into her heroism.

EMMA	I love that idea.

CLYDE ROMANO	Great. To that end, I still have to show the studio options. So let's do a few versions here today to cover what I want, and the normal, overconfident way they might want.

SHELLEY	Ready?

HOPE MURPHY	Thanks.

ZANE ELTON	Yeah, get me a chicken wrap, with a side of hummus.

CASHIER	$12.44.

HOPE MURPHY	How have you been?

ZANE ELTON	Fine.

HOPE MURPHY	(beat) Is work going all right for you?

ZANE ELTON	Yes.

CASHIER	Number 219!

HOPE MURPHY	So... any fun plans this weekend?

ZANE ELTON	Leave me alone. I wasn't interested in you before, and I certainly don't want to be bored by you now.

CASHIER	Number 220! 220!

GRAY	Thanks. You don't deserve her. Either of them. Hope. Hope! Hey, are you all right?

HOPE MURPHY	Gray? Yes, I'm fine. Oh, thank you-- (beat) You saw.

GRAY	I could never put my finger on why I didn't care for Zane. Until today.

HOPE MURPHY	I think I lost my appetite.

GRAY	No, come on. Don't let him get to you.

HOPE MURPHY	Want some? This isn't just the fan-girl in me, but I sometimes wish I were like Emma.

GRAY	How so?

HOPE MURPHY	You know... everyone loves her.

GRAY	Zane isn't everyone.

HOPE MURPHY	But... it must be nice to be sought after.

GRAY	Maybe that's overrated. And... Emma is wonderful, but it's easy to just see the actress while ignoring the person. (beat) She's not a perfect person. I mean,	 she's my best friend but sometimes she doesn't see the impact she has on others. She's very human.

HOPE MURPHY	(laughs) It's hard to see her that way.

GRAY	(lightly) Trust me, I see it. And I don't always agree with her "matchmaking" picks,	 but she does choose great friends.
 
HOPE MURPHY	Thank you.

GRAY	You're welcome. (beat) You know, a group of us are getting together tonight.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh, Emma told me. But I don't know—

GRAY	Come. Forget Zane. And have some fun.

HOPE MURPHY	Okay. (beat) Thanks.

LIZ	So how'd the camera test go?

EMMA	It went great. Really well.

ELINOR	That's awesome! And you were so worried you had a horrible audition.

EMMA	I did, but guess what? I got the second chance because they loved how "conflicted" I played it before. Who knew Zane throwing me off my game would lead to this?

GRAY	So what's next?

EMMA	It's back to waiting by the phone, but at least this time I feel like I did my best.

HOPE MURPHY	I hope you'll get it.

EMMA	Thank you.

ELINOR	So, how's everyone decorating these?

LIZ	I'm going to make mine dance-themed. Somehow.

HOPE MURPHY	I think I'll leave my profession out of this.

GRAY	And I just want to point out that I am here with you all, even though I voted for bowling.

LIZ	Hope, how is your new job?

HOPE MURPHY	It's good. The other dentist and staff are really nice. There are a lot of patients each day but I like to keep busy.

GRAY	Sounds like a good fit then.

HOPE MURPHY	Yeah.

ELINOR	Where did you move from?

HOPE MURPHY	Washington.

LIZ	That's a decent move. Any family around here?

HOPE MURPHY	Nope, just me.

EMMA	Oh! I've been meaning to tell you. There's this actor I worked with on my last movie. Super nice, handsome, and he actually went to dental school before he became an actor--want me to introduce you to him?

HOPE MURPHY	I think I'm fine.

EMMA	Or I can keep looking—

HOPE MURPHY	No, you should focus on your acting and getting that part.

EMMA	Are you sure?

HOPE MURPHY	Yeah. And if I change my mind, I'll let you know.

ELINOR	Who is it?

EMMA	Barry. He's invited me to a party.

HOPE MURPHY	Are you going to go?

EMMA	Of course.

ELINOR	I didn't realize you planned to go out with him again.

EMMA	Why wouldn't I? He's... attentive. And nice--that's a given. He has these dreams, and I find that refreshing.

LIZ	Shouldn't he be beyond that by now?

EMMA	Dreams?

LIZ	You know, like settling down and past the point of figuring out what he wants to be when he grows up. He's kind of late to the party to be a lawyer.

GRAY	(under his breath) I'll say.

EMMA	Is he? I kind of admire that he's worked hard to finish his law degree.

HOPE MURPHY	Thanks for getting me to come tonight.

GRAY	Kind of fun, isn't it? Don't tell them I said that though.

ELINOR	Can we eat these when they're done?
	
LIZ	Why not?

HOPE MURPHY	Have you heard anything about that new space movie that's out?
	
GRAY	Uh, no, not much.

HOPE MURPHY	I kind of like science-fiction type things.

GRAY	Yeah, me too.

HOPE MURPHY	I thought I'd go see it this weekend. (beat) Want to come with me?

GRAY	When were you thinking?

EMMA	Isn't he funny?

HOPE MURPHY	Friday.

GRAY	Yeah. (looking to her; genuine) Yeah, that works.

ELINOR	Did you know the firm spends $650,000 on private jet rentals every quarter?

GRAY	What's wrong with flying commercial?

ELINOR	Nothing, but why stoop to that if you don't mind wasting money?

GRAY	Is that on the top of your cost- cutting list?

ELINOR	Sadly, no. I have a feeling some of the people whose names are on the building might be protective of their private jet trips anyway.

GRAY	Probably.

ELINOR	So, what do you think about Barry and Emma?

GRAY	What about them?

ELINOR	I thought you'd be opposed to her going out with him again.

GRAY	She didn't ask my opinion.

ELINOR	And if she did?

GRAY	If he makes her happy, then I'm fine.

ELINOR	Really?

GRAY	How do you feel about him?
 
ELINOR	I don't have any of his expenses yet but something tells me they'll all end up on my recommendation list for trimming back. That doesn't mean he's a bad person though.

GRAY	No. It's up to Emma.

EMMA	Oh!

GRAY	Sorry.

EMMA	Come in. What are you doing here?

GRAY	I'm seeing a movie with Hope, but I thought I'd say hi.

EMMA	Oh.

GRAY	You're going out.

EMMA	Yeah. Barry.

GRAY	Is he picking you up?

EMMA	Uh, no, I'm meeting him at this party.

GRAY	Well, have fun.

EMMA	Thanks. You too.

HOPE MURPHY	I chose seats in the middle, towards the back.

GRAY	Works for me. Thanks for suggesting this.

HOPE MURPHY	Thanks for coming with me.

BARRY BELL	You're here! Great! Come in, welcome. Everyone, this is Emma Hutton. THE Emma Hutton, outstanding actress.

EMMA	Hi (quietly to Barry) I'm way overdressed.

BARRY BELL	No, no, you look fabulous. Come on, let's get started.

EMMA	Started?

BARRY BELL	Everyone, as you know, I've always wanted to act, and Jocelyn--Has a killer script. I think you're going to love it as we read through it tonight. Grab a drink and some food and we'll get going.

EMMA	What's going on?

BARRY BELL	What do you mean?

EMMA	It's just, you said this was a party--

BARRY BELL	(still enthusiastic) It is!

EMMA	This is a script read-through. I	 know because I've sat through them before.

BARRY BELL	Trust me. We'll have a great time.

JOCELYN	(reading the direction) "Camera pulls back. The rain falls around our hero. Undeterred, he boldly stands in the elements. The people cheer for him. Fade to black.

BARRY BELL	Wasn't that wonderful? Jocelyn--you're so talented. (turning to Emma) So Emma. What do you think?

EMMA	Um, it was very interesting.
 
BARRY BELL	You're so connected, and the moment I met you, I knew we were all destined to work together.

EMMA	How…?

BARRY BELL	We have this awesome story. I've always wanted to act. And you can play the role of Chelsea. How can we make it all happen?

EMMA	You know, I think I need a refill.

HOPE MURPHY	What did you think?

GRAY	I liked it. You?

HOPE MURPHY	Loved it.

GRAY	Good.

HOPE MURPHY	Thanks again for coming with me.

GRAY	I'm glad I did. Are you hungry? How about we go get a bite to eat?

HOPE MURPHY	That sounds great.

BARRY BELL	Everything okay?

EMMA	Yeah. This was ... different than I expected.

BARRY BELL	I know, right? The script just takes you in a totally different direction than you'd think.

EMMA	No, that's not-- (deep breath) Why am I here?

BARRY BELL	What do you mean?

EMMA	I mean, why have you asked me out-- asked to see me the other night and tonight?

BARRY BELL	You inspire me.

EMMA	Okay....

BARRY BELL	I wished all my life to do what you do, but my father envisioned me as Bell and Whatever junior partner. But that doesn't have to be a dream. If I can show him this can be real, that I have a shot....

EMMA	How did you come across Jocelyn's work?

BARRY BELL	(nothing to hide) Oh, I've always told her she is creative. She thought I was just saying that because I'm her boyfriend but I think she gets it now. So tell me honestly. Do you think we can get this movie going for all of us?

LIZ	What did you tell him?

EMMA	I gave him the number of my new agent.

LIZ	That's it?

EMMA	I called ahead and told my agent to take it somewhat seriously. "Hey, Barry wants to act and he has this project," etc, etc.

LIZ	You're nicer than I am. Barry led you on.


EMMA	I don't think he meant to.

LIZ	The way you described how he acted--

EMMA	He has a bit of a flirtatious personality but ... as I think about it, every conversation was about acting. It was business to him. And not like I can fault him.

LIZ	What do you mean?

EMMA	Having broken Zane's heart without realizing he had feelings for me, can I really put down Barry?

LIZ	Fine. (beat) Are you okay?

EMMA	(beat) Yeah. When I don't dwell on how I misread everything, or when I don't think about how Gray will tease me about this, I'm fine.

LIZ	Don't tell Gray then.

EMMA	He's going to figure out my "relationship" fizzled eventually.

LIZ	Then let him find out. You don't have to tell him the details.

EMMA	Class time. I'll get out of your way.

LIZ	Next time wear clothes you can move in more.

EMMA	(grins) Thanks. Hey, how are you?

HOPE MURPHY	Good!

EMMA	Do you want to do something tonight? I'm feeling like staying in for a girls night or something.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh, I can't. I came home for my lunch break so I could get an outfit. I won't have time to come here after work.

EMMA	What are you doing?

HOPE MURPHY	Gray invited me over for dinner.

EMMA	He did?

HOPE MURPHY	Yeah.

EMMA	Just you?

HOPE MURPHY	Yeah.

EMMA	That's great.


HOPE MURPHY	Well, I better hurry back to work.

EMMA	Yeah, sure. See you later.

HOPE MURPHY	Bye!

EMMA	Hello? I did? Oh thank you! Thank you!!

ELINOR	Taking off?

GRAY	Yeah.

ELINOR	Did you hear?

GRAY	What?

ELINOR	Emma got that role she wanted.

GRAY	That's great.

ELINOR	Liz and I are headed over there to celebrate. You coming?

GRAY	No, I have a date with Hope.

ELINOR	Oh, that's great. Makes sense but I wasn't expecting it.

GRAY	She's nice.

ELINOR	Yeah. I like her. Is Emma okay with it?

GRAY	Why wouldn't she be?

ELINOR	Well, you know, she was trying to set up Hope for awhile.

GRAY	She'll get over it.

ELINOR	And I thought you... and Emma...You're good friends.

GRAY	And...

ELINOR	And, I thought maybe there might be something deeper than friendship, at times.

GRAY	I'm the brother Emma never had.

ELINOR	That's not what I meant.

GRAY	She dates and comes back to tell me about her latest love all the time. Why shouldn't I do the same? You know, give someone a chance?

EMMA	The director said the studio execs loved me. They saw my range and realized I could really make this movie stand out.

ELINOR	When do you start filming?

EMMA	A week from Tuesday. There's so much to do. I have to meet with the director and go over character, fight choreography, costume fittings. Ugh and I really need to start memorizing all my lines.

LIZ	The character—

ELINOR	Don't spoil it. So Gray's got to get going on your contract then.

EMMA	Yeah, it'll be fine. I'll tell him tomorrow.

LIZ	You haven't told him?

EMMA	Not yet.

LIZ	I thought he'd be your first call. Where is he tonight?

EMMA	On a date.

LIZ	I didn't think he dated much.

EMMA	I guess he's starting.

LIZ	Who is it?

EMMA	Hope.

LIZ	That's sweet. Isn't it?

EMMA	Yeah. Well, I was trying to set her up with someone. So Gray kind of derailed my plans there. But that's fine. It happens. The next scene is really great.

CLYDE ROMANO	In the aftermath of the battle, I think she'd be shaken.

EMMA	I like that. It'd be the opposite of what everyone is used to in such a moment after the triumph.

CLYDE ROMANO	Exactly. Instead of glorying in victory, she's vulnerable.

EMMA	What about when she faces Mortak? Am I saying that name right?

CLYDE ROMANO	Yeah. I want her to doubt herself, then be overconfident when he stumbles, and then doubtful again.

EMMA	Got it.

SHELLEY	Excuse me. We have a problem with our Mortak actor. He broke his leg water skiing.
	
CLYDE ROMANO	(sighs) What other choices do we have?

SHELLEY	Here's who the studio wants.

CLYDE ROMANO	Sorry, Emma.

EMMA	No problem.

SHELLEY	Oh, Emma, we haven't received your contract back yet.

EMMA	I texted my lawyer about it. He's going through it and will get it back to you soon.

SHELLEY	Thank you.

EMMA	Excuse me.

CLYDE ROMANO	Let's go with this one.

EMMA	Hope, hi. (beat) Lunch sounds great. (beat) Okay, bye.

CLYDE ROMANO	Where were we?

HOPE MURPHY	Gray is so kind. Every moment I spend with him makes me like him more.

EMMA	Good. You two have been dating then?

HOPE MURPHY	I guess so. It's so early still, you know? But I wanted your input.

EMMA	Mine?

HOPE MURPHY	Tell me about him. Everything.

EMMA	Oh. Um, okay. Where do you want me to begin?

HOPE MURPHY	His family.

EMMA	All right. It's his parents and his younger brother. His parents are really nice. His dad was a Chief something-or-other of a company, but he's retired now. And his mother is a doctor. She's still practicing.

HOPE MURPHY	Wow. That's... intimidating.

EMMA	Don't worry. You're a dentist. You studied and worked hard to get where you are too.

HOPE MURPHY	What made Gray go into law school?

EMMA	He saw what it was like to be a doctor from his mother. And business from his father. He wanted something different. I remember when he got into law school, he was so proud. A month into the program, though, he hated it.

HOPE MURPHY	Why?

EMMA	It was so competitive. He liked the challenge and what he learned but not the atmosphere. He even considered quitting. He knew if he did, he'd be mad at himself some day. I told him the only thing that mattered is if he was happy. Or could be happy with whatever he chose. I had gotten this role, my first full movie, and they sent me this contract. I didn't know what to make of it. So I asked Gray. He helped me understand everything, and what to ask about. It got him thinking. Maybe contracts and a specific industry were better than the usual courtroom field.

HOPE MURPHY	And that's how he came to be your lawyer.

EMMA	Yes. I always knew I could trust him. He's been my best...My best friend.

HOPE MURPHY	What about things he likes?

EMMA	You don't want me to tell you everything.	If you like him, don't miss out on getting to know him yourself.

LIZ	Great job today! Keep practicing your leaps. See you next week. What's wrong?

EMMA	Is Elinor here yet?

LIZ	Is she supposed to be?

EMMA	I texted her to meet—

ELINOR	I'm here. What's going on?

EMMA	I thought I could just ignore it, but I can't.

LIZ	What?

EMMA	Gray.

LIZ	What'd he do?

EMMA	Nothing, it's just--he and Hope are dating, and it kept bothering me, and I thought it was all because I wouldn't be able to match them, or something else, or maybe I was upset Barry didn't work out, but it's not that.

ELINOR	What happened with Barry?

LIZ	He just wanted to be around Emma for her acting connections. Keep up. Emma, what's bothering you then?

EMMA	(beat) I love him. I love Gray.

ELINOR	I'm so happy for you!

LIZ	You're sure?

ELINOR	What kind of question is that?

LIZ	Well, face it, Emma can be a bit oblivious when it comes to romance, which is remarkable considering how many times she acts like she's falling in love in movies.

ELINOR	She's not oblivious.

EMMA	Yeah, I'm not.

LIZ	You date and realize you don't really like something about a man, and then you turn your attention to pairing other people up until someone else catches your attention.
	
ELINOR	Just because she hasn't really been in love before doesn't mean she hasn't wanted it this whole time.

EMMA	Yes! What she said.

LIZ	What I mean is, are you sure it's love? Not jealousy that someone else has Gray's attention?

EMMA	It's not jealousy. (beat) I think of all the times Gray and I have spent together, and this warmth fills my soul, like no one else does. (beat) He's ... every happy moment in my life.

LIZ	You are in love.

ELINOR	Of course she is!

EMMA	But he's with Hope now.

LIZ	So?

EMMA	I can't interfere. I don't want to hurt Hope--again.

ELINOR	Emma's right.

EMMA	And I don't want to hurt Gray either.

LIZ	How would it hurt Gray?

EMMA	He might just think of me as a client. Look how I thought of Zane. What if I'm the Zane here?

LIZ	You aren't. Tell him how you feel.

ELINOR	Unless you're scared if he doesn't feel the same way about you? Like it'll make your friendship awkward?

EMMA	Yes! That!

LIZ	(to Elinor) Stop making her doubt. (to Emma) You need to tell Gray how you feel.

ELINOR	But what about Hope?

EMMA	Yes, what about her?

LIZ	She'll get over it.

ELINOR	Liz!

LIZ	What? If she's a true friend here, she'd want Emma to be happy.

ELINOR	That's a two-way street.

EMMA	What if Gray and Hope are happy? Think about it. When has Gray really dated anyone else? That must mean something. And Hope...she's sweet, and smart and.... Are we surprised he'd see that too? Gray has been my friend for years. I missed my chance. Now...I want him to be happy. Even if I'm not part of that happiness.

LIZ	Come here—

GRAY	Barry.

BARRY BELL	Gray! Good to see you. Did Emma tell you? She set up a meeting for me with her agent.

GRAY	Oh. Why?

BARRY BELL	I'm getting into the business! Don't tell my father yet though. Emma read the script that my gir-- Oh, this is her. Hey honey!

EMMA	If the chances are so poor, do we give up then? No. We hold to hope.	 When there's none other, yes. Spread	 the word. Fall back to the forest. The fight for our very salvation is just beginning.

GRAY	I have the contract for you to sign.

EMMA	Oh. Thanks. Come in.

GRAY	Are you all right?

EMMA	Uh. Just nervous. About this role.

GRAY	You'll do fine. (beat) You have everything you want.

EMMA	Yeah....

GRAY	I'm happy for you.

EMMA	Me too. I mean, for you. You know, you and Hope. It's great.

GRAY	Thanks.

EMMA	(making light of it) I guess you saved me from pairing her up with someone else.

GRAY	Probably a good thing.

EMMA	After Zane, definitely. Well. I can't fault her choice. You're... you're the best any woman could ask for.

GRAY	Thank you...

EMMA	(fake smile) I'm so far behind on my lines. I should keep practicing.

GRAY	Yeah, do...that. I'll...see you later.

HOPE MURPHY	--It's so simple, but people ignore it all the time.

GRAY	I think I had a slew of cavities when I was a kid before I started following the whole flossing advice.

HOPE MURPHY	You're not alone. I should be grateful. It keeps the dental industry going. Thanks for tonight.

GRAY	Yeah. I had a good time.

HOPE MURPHY	Are we still on for the movie this weekend?

GRAY	Sure. I'll pick up tickets.

HOPE MURPHY	Okay.

GRAY	Good night, Hope.

HOPE MURPHY	Good night.
	
BARRY BELL	This was all your idea anyway. I won't stay to waste away here!

ELINOR	The only wasting with Barry was his credit card bill. For having no clients, he sure had a lot of work lunches.

GRAY	Surprised he quit?

ELINOR	No.

GRAY	I wonder how Emma will feel about this.

ELINOR	Why would she care?

GRAY	They're dating.
 
ELINOR	Yeah, that never really happened. Their relationship was pretty much over before it began.

GRAY	Really? Why didn't she tell me?

ELINOR	(strategically) Maybe she didn't want to distract you with you and Hope dating.

GRAY	Great.

ELINOR	What?

GRAY	Another contract, from one of my more difficult clients.
	
ELINOR	Sorry.

GRAY	I better get back to work.

HOPE MURPHY	Hi!

GRAY	Hi. I got reservations for 6:30.

HOPE MURPHY	I'm just tidying up, finishing a few things.
 
GRAY	Great.

HOPE MURPHY	How was your day?

GRAY	I survived.

HOPE MURPHY	That bad?

GRAY	This one client--I handle a lot of entertainment contracts, like with actors.

HOPE MURPHY	Like Emma.

GRAY	Yeah, except she's not difficult. Actors, actresses, this one today-- some of them are so bossy, like no one is good enough to talk to them, like they're condescending to even address you.

HOPE MURPHY	You're kidding. Although--I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

GRAY	Never mind that I have a law degree, a successful career, that I'm good at my job.

HOPE MURPHY	I'm sorry.

GRAY	It's not just me either. Unless it's someone they want a favor from, they're ... vicious.

HOPE MURPHY	And yet lawyers get the bad reputation.

GRAY	Lucky me.

HOPE MURPHY	You're the best. And if a client	 can't see that, that's their loss.

GRAY	Thanks.

HOPE MURPHY	I never thought you'd have to deal with something like that.

GRAY	Mean people in law?

HOPE MURPHY	People who...look down on you.

GRAY	Maybe I was spoiled at the beginning. Emma was my first client, and she never was like this.

HOPE MURPHY	And she was already your friend.

GRAY	Yeah, but she's always been nice to people. I mean, she doesn't do that I'm-going-to-put-you-down-because-I- can thing that others do.

HOPE MURPHY	Yeah, I get what you mean.

GRAY	(beat) I've always admired that about her. She has never let the camera, the fame, the ... whatever, change her. She's always been Emma at heart.

HOPE MURPHY	If only more actors were like her, right?
 
GRAY	Or all people, actor or not.

HOPE MURPHY	You really admire her.

GRAY	What do you mean?

HOPE MURPHY	You love her. It's all right. I thought it was just friendship, a special one, but nothing more. She was dating someone, and you said yes, so....

GRAY	Hope. We're not—

HOPE MURPHY	I know nothing is going on between you two. But I can see that you care for her. And I think she loves you too. I don't want to stand in the way of that.

GRAY	We may be friends but we're never going to be more than that.

HOPE MURPHY	Not if you don't try. Have you? Have you talked to her about how you feel?

GRAY	It doesn't matter. I'm seeing you.

HOPE MURPHY	Maybe you shouldn't anymore. Gray.... think about it. Be honest with yourself. Besides, I'm not crazy about being someone's second choice.

GRAY	What now then?

HOPE MURPHY	For me, I don't mind focusing on work for awhile, without worrying about dating. But I'd still like to be your friend.
 
GRAY	Me too.

HOPE MURPHY	Hey. Happy First Day of your movie.

EMMA	Thank you.

HOPE MURPHY	You'll do great.

EMMA	Thanks.

HOPE MURPHY	Um, have you talked to Gray lately?

EMMA	No. I've been busy.

HOPE MURPHY	Of course. You should though. It's just, I've been seeing things and thinking, and he and I—

EMMA	Sorry. I need to get going. It's never good to be late the first day.

HOPE MURPHY	Oh. Yeah, of course.

EMMA	Can we catch up later?

HOPE MURPHY	You bet. I hope everything goes well.

EMMA	Thanks.

GRAY	Can I join you?

ELINOR	Hey! Yeah.

GRAY	Job listings? Are you jumping ship?
 
ELINOR	Not at all, but I know this is temporary.

GRAY	I can see what else the firm—

ELINOR	It's okay. Nothing lasts forever. Better to be prepared. Although, check out this one. Personal auditor.

GRAY	Huh?

ELINOR	"Help sort through receipts from past decade for an Internal Revenue Service audit."

GRAY	Thrilling.

ELINOR	How are you doing?

GRAY	Okay. Hope told me she didn't want us to date anymore.

ELINOR	Oh. That's... unexpected. I thought she liked you.

GRAY	She thinks I'm in love with Emma.

 
	
ELINOR	What do you think? So what are you doing here?

GRAY	I don't know how she feels.

ELINOR	I do.

GRAY	And?

ELINOR	I shouldn't say anything.

GRAY	Come on. Women talk. Tell me.

ELINOR	You should go see her. Talk to her. Because how she feels is something you should hear directly from her.

CLYDE ROMANO	Okay, are we ready?
 
MAKEUP ARTIST	Can I have last looks?

CLYDE ROMANO	Go.

EMMA	Thanks.

CLYDE ROMANO	All right, let's go!

1ST AD	Let's roll it!

SOUND MIXER	Sound speed!

CAMERA OPERATOR	Camera speed!

2ND AC	(holding slate) Scene 45, take 3.
	
CLYDE ROMANO	And... action!

VILLAGER #1	My lady! We won't succeed.	

EMMA	If we fail now, we never recover. We never return to any happiness or peace, which many of us fought for since we were children.

VILLAGER #1	What can we do? You are to lead us, aren't you? Tell us!

EMMA	We retreat.
	
VILLAGER #2	Retreat?!
	
EMMA	We must. Not for our own lives but for those of every village near and far. We must survive for them.
	
VILLAGER #2	What difference will it make? Whether we die today or in another battle?

EMMA	There is someone who knows a weakness, the key to defeating our enemies. We find them. Together, we will rise	 again.
	
VILLAGER #1	The villages are still a mere drop of water in all the oceans combined against them!
	
EMMA	Perhaps. If the chances are so poor, do we give up then? No. We hold to hope.

VILLAGER #2	Hope? That's your answer?

EMMA	When there's none other, yes. (stronger) Spread the word. Fall back to the forest. The fight for our very salvation is just beginning.

CLYDE ROMANO	Cut! Emma, that was great. Just a little bobble on the hope line, but the emotion was great. What do you think of going more gradual on the confidence? Let it slowly ramp up and then -- boom!

EMMA	I like it. Could I have a moment?

CLYDE ROMANO	Sure. Everyone, let's reset!
	
EMMA	What are you doing here?

GRAY	I'm sorry, I know I don't do this—

EMMA	No, it's fine. I'm just surprised.

GRAY	I couldn't wait till later.

EMMA	For what?

GRAY	To see you.

EMMA	What's happened?

GRAY	Nothing, nothing bad. But I... I've waited long enough, and I had to tell you....That I love you.

EMMA	(hopeful) You do?

GRAY	And I know our families forced us to endure each other's company when we were younger but somewhere along the way, we became friends, didn't we?

EMMA	Of course.
	
GRAY	And somewhere since then, I hoped we'd be more.	That you'd see me as more than a friend. When you started dating Barry, I thought I had to move on, but I couldn't. Not really.

EMMA	(worried) What about Hope?

GRAY	We're not dating anymore. She's fine. She helped me figure out how I feel.

EMMA	She did?

GRAY	Yes. But it doesn't matter what she or anyone else thinks, only you.

EMMA	I love you too. I always have but I didn't realize it till I thought it was too late.

GRAY	You're not.

EMMA	Good! Because I do love you.

CLYDE ROMANO	Tell Makeup we're going to need touchups again.



(THE END.)
