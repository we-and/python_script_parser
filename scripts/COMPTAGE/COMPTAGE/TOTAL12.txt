 

JONATAS	Do you really know that guy?

ELIZA	“Aham”
	
ARTHUR	You’re beautiful, uh? I work looking for girls like you, and you, you are wonderful.

ELIZA	He said I could be a model.

ARTHUR	Look, posture, walk…

CAROLINA	Ah.

ARTHUR	It’s easy to teach that. And I can prove that to you.

ELIZA	Hi.

ARTHUR	It’s you.
	
ELIZA	(Laughs) It’s me.

ARTHUR	Her hair is a bit messy, but it’s pretty.

ARTHUR (off)	She’s dirty, but she just needs a shower! Under this misery there’s a beautiful girl. I'm going to turn this flower girl…

ARTHUR	… into the new Total Dreamer Girl!

CAROLINA	You’re so full of yourself!

ARTHUR	I’m not full of myself. I’m competent. I understand about woman.

CAROLINA	Ah!

ARTHUR	This natural beauty thing you want, I can create that!

CAROLINA	Wow! (Laughs)

ARTHUR	I just need to teach a girl to have a confident look, posture, nice walk…
	
CAROLINA	“Aham”

ARTHUR	And, of course, my personal touch! And I don’t reveal what that is. Not even under torture. Or sweet gestures…

CAROLINA	Oh, so where is she? Where is your little flower girl? I can’t see her. Without her, there’s no bet.

ARTHUR	I’ll be right back with my future magazine cover.

CAROLINA	He’s such a show off!

LOBATO	Do you need anything, doctor Arthur? Can I help you?

ARTHUR	Have you seen that girl selling flowers? She was right here.

LOBATO	Did she steal something from you?

ARTHUR	No, of course not, Lobato. I just want to talk to her. Do you know where she went?

LOBATO	Ah, she shows up around here sometimes during lunchtime. She’s always around this area.

ARTHUR	Do you at least know her name?

LOBATO	No.

CAROLINA	Arthur, where is your florist? I thought your beggar was going to join us for lunch. Poor girl.

ARTHUR	She disappeared.

CAROLINA	Ah, as if! This is just a stupid excuse, because you don’t want to lose our bet, right? Obviously.

ARTHUR	Who said I’m giving up?

CAROLINA	Arthur, enough with that show, ok? Lets eat, because the lobster is getting cold.

ARTHUR	You think I’m just saying this things, right?

CAROLINA	m going to find that girl and rist the next Totally Amazing Girl.rince. king you talk like that. a personality! We can teach herHum...

ARTHUR	If I want, I can make that florist the next Total Dreamer Girl.

CAROLINA	Repeating…

ARTHUR	Lobato told me she’s always around here. I’m going to find that girl and show you what I’m capable of.

CAROLINA	Arthur! Enough! Leave your pride behind! Admit it’s impossible for you to win this bet!

ARTHUR	Never.

ELIZA	(RC)

JONATAS	What happened?

ELIZA	(Cry)

JONATAS	Give me a minute. Take care of this, Riscado.

ELIZA	(RC)

RISCADO	Where are you going?	

JONATAS	Take care of my products. Come over here!

ELIZA	(RC)

JONATAS	What happened?

ELIZA	He doesn’t remember me. He humiliated me in front of that ridiculous, nasty lady!

JONATAS	Who?

ELIZA	The prince.

JONATAS	Who?

ELIZA	Don’t you remember that guy we saw in the palace, in Downtown? The guy I knew, from Campo Claro.

JONATAS	Oh, that nice guy you showed me…

ELIZA	Yes, that’s him. You were right, that guy is an idiot. He and that nasty lady were laughing at me. They even wanted to see my teeth. They treated me like, like if I was something, an animal.

JONATAS	And what did you do?

ELIZA	I lost my mind, right? Obviously! I threw my flowers on her face and I said a lot of stuff. Uh, but I’m still so angry. I can feel it here, see? It’s getting worst. I’m so ashamed. 

JONATAS	Calm down, red head. Don’t be upset. This people with money think they can do everything. They think they mock us. They think they are better than others. They don't deserve your tears.

ELIZA	I need to tell you something. Since I saw that idiot, on that red carpet, I knew I was going to see him again, you know? I thought he was “gonna” (going to) recognize me, help me. I even dreamed about him. (RC) Stupid! I was so stupid! I sound like Dayse, my little sister. She believes in charming prince.

JONATAS	(Laughs) That would be good, right? If life was like a fairytale. A charming prince. A crystal shoe. A happy ending… You would be Cinderella, and who would I be?

ELIZA	The frog.

JONATAS	The frog? No problem! Can you kiss me so we can figure if I’ll turn into a prince?

ELIZA	I don’t want to think about fairytales anymore. If I see that horrible prince again, I’m “gonna” (going to) slap him!

JONATAS	Now it looks like Eliza is back! I know you won’t take that kind of treatment.

ELIZA	(RC) I really won’t.

LURDINHA	(RC)

KATIA	Tcharam!

LURDINHA	(Laughs)

KATIA	(Laughs)

LURDINHA	You nailed it! And the makeup is amazing!

KATIA	Ah! (Laughs)

CASSANDRA	Is it good?

KATIA	What?

LURDINHA	(Laughs)

KATIA	Darling, red head is the new blond! (Laughs)

DEBORA	Ah, don’t you think this red looks fake?

KATIA	Hey, Debora! Since when do you understand anything about hair color?

DEBORA	I study chemistry. I know all the ingredients in that formula.

LURDINHA	This is about looks, honey! And you missed that class. Leave it to the professionals!

KATIA	Thank you.

LURDINHA	(RC)

CASSANDRA	Let me see! Let me see!

LURDINHA	Here.

CASSANDRA	(Yells) No, wait a minute, wait a minute! The Total Dreamer contest wants a girl with natural beauty. Maybe this is a little too much, huh, girls?

KATIA	“Aham” (denying)

DEBORA	Yes.

LURDINHA	You want more natural than this?

KATIA	No way!

DEBORA	Guys…

LURDINHA	Only if you were born a redhead!

KATIA	(Laughs)

DEBORA	Ah, why don’t we had some freckles? I think it’s “gonna” (going to) look natural, right?

CASSANDRA	Do you think it’s “gonna” (going to) look good?

KATIA	Hey, hey, hey. Listen, I think your sister was being ironic. Get it?


LURDINHA	Your sister is making fun of our work.

CASSANDRA	Hey, envy girl! If you’re not helping, than don’t be a problem! Ok?

DEBORA	I’m trying.

CASSANDRA	Focus!

DEBORA	(RC)

CASSANDRA	Here, on me!

DEBORA	Ok.

CASSANDRA	If I want to be accepted in Excalibur again, I need a new name, right? Because they really don’t like me, guys.

DEBORA	(RC)

LURDINHA	You need a strong name. A name that matches your hair!

KATIA	Yes! A name with personality and attitude, you know?

LURDINHA	Yeah!

KATIA	Something like, Cassandra to…

LURDINHA	Eh…

CASSANDRA	I know! We can mix all the letters in my name and change from Cassandra to Salamandra!

KATIA E LURDINHA	(RC)

LURDINHA	Uh, I got goosebumps!

CASSANDRA	Salamandra!

KATIA	Sounds do pretty.

LURDINHA	What a strong name! (RC)

DEBORA	Like a lizard?

CASSANDRA	Honey, you're the lizard!

DEBORA	Ah!

CASSANDRA	Right? Kiss!

DEBORA	No…

CASSANDRA	Salamandra is a good one?

LURDINHA	Love it! Love it!

CASSANDRA	Does it sounds good?

KATIA	Yeah, it does.

CASSANDRA	Is it sticky?

LOBATO	Doctor Arthur.

ARTHUR	Lobato. Carolina, my dear, the bill is yours. Since you lost our last bet.

CAROLINA	Ah.

LOBATO	Mrs. Carolina.

CAROLINA	But the next one I’m going to win, Lobato.

LOBATO	Excuse me.

CAROLINA	(Laughs)

ARTHUR	This means we have a bet?

CAROLINA	Your crazy idea of transforming that beggar in a model? Ah, please, Arthur. Enough!

ARTHUR	Not just a model. The Total Dreamer Girl.

CAROLINA	(RC) Are you going to insist on that? 

ARTHUR	Of course I will. How much is the bet? How much? A dinner in a nice restaurant like this? Another Champagne bottle? How much is the bet? Tell me.

CAROLINA	Since you’re so convinced you’re winning this bet…

ARTHUR	“Ham”?

CAROLINA	… why don’t we make this bet a little more interesting? You will have to pay a lot for being so full of yourself, Arthur. 

ARTHUR	You’re free to choose. What do you want? Say it.

CAROLINA	If I win…

ARTHUR	Hum?

CAROLINA	I want Excalibur.

ARTHUR	 (Laughs)

CAROLINA	Your model agency is mine.

ARTHUR	(Laughs) Ah, that’s not possible! Are you crazy? (Laughs)

CAROLINA	Am I?

ARTHUR	(Laughs)

CAROLINA	Am I crazy?

ARTHUR	(Laughs)

CAROLINA	You can give up.

ARTHUR	(Laughs) Never.

CAROLINA	So, it’s a bet! Hum?

ARTHUR	Wait. Wait. Wait! If that florist becomes the new Total Dreamer Girl, you’re quitting your adored magazine, and you will work for me, in my agency.

CAROLINA	(Laughs) You are insane!

ARTHUR	My agency or your job. So, deal?

CAROLINA	Deal!

ARTHUR	You guys need to find that girl, ok?

MAX	The Total Dreamer Girl? Everyone in the agency is working on it. We have several new options…

ADELE	Right.

ARTHUR	 (RC)

MAX	… a lot of new girls from all over Brazil, right, Adele?

ADELE	By the way…

MAX	Look at that!

ADELE	… There’s a girl from outside Brazil sending her material. We’re super popular now!

MAX	Take a look.

ARTHUR	But I don’t want any of these girls now. I know who I want.

 MAX E ADELE	Who?

ARTHUR	It’s florist girl. A redhead.

MAX	Is this a joke?

ARTHUR	No, it’s a bet. A bet I’m going to win, no matter what it takes.

CAROLINA	Pietro!

PIETRO	Yes?

CAROLINA	Mr. “Arthur Presumptuous” is really mistaken if he thinks I’m joking! What are you people looking at? You don't have any work to do? If you have a lot of free time, go look for another job! No one should get paid just to look at me! Come on, Pietro!
		
PIETRO	What a day, huh?

CAROLINA	Come in, Pietro! (RC) My God!

PIETRO	I got a feeling that your lunch with Arthur is being hard to digest.

CAROLINA	(RC)

PIETRO	Do you need an antacid, honey?

CAROLINA	I want to chop off that show-off’s head! That’s what I want.

PIETRO	What happened?

CAROLINA	(RC)
		
PIETRO	Wait, let me guess. You lost another bet.

CAROLINA	No. I didn’t lose, and I won’t lose. Can you believe that bastard thinks he can transform a beggar, a street beggar, into our new Total Dreamer Girl?

PIETRO	Well, it depends on how much Champagne you guys had.

CAROLINA	No. Depends on the size of his ego. He’s playing with my contest. Can you believe he said… he said that with his personal touch, any girl would look like a natural beauty? Can you believe that?

PIETRO	Oh, his touch, huh? You mentioned that “touch” so many times…

CAROLINA	Pietro, for the love of God! Huh? I’m not talking about that, you perverted! I’m talking about something different! Who does he think he is? He thinks he is God! But he will see. I’m going to teach him a lesson he will never forget.

PIETRO	You’re the best “Despicable Me”

CAROLINA	You know me, right, Pietro?

PIETRO	(RC)

CAROLINA	When I’m good, I’m very good. But when I’m bad, I I’m better! By the way, why the new issue model is not ready yet? “Ham”? The structure is not complete! The exclusive interview with Sandrini, should be exclusive, or shouldn’t? It’s going to be a biased toward the government? Because if it’s not, I don’t want it! And I’m asking if he dated the motorcycle delivery boy! Otherwise, I’m not even publishing the interview!

PIETRO	Sure, sure, sure. I will, I will, I will check all that. Excuse, sweetie.

PIETRO	(RC) Don’t worry, guys! No one here is getting fired!

FUNCIONÁRIOS	(RC – relieve)

PIETRO	Yet! But if someone needs to deliver any article, do it fast so we can add at the magazine’s structure! Otherwise, Carol is going to lose her mind! Was I clear?

LU	Pietro. Pietro. Excuse me.

LU	Can, can I show my article to you? Because when Carol is like this…

PIETRO	Our chief writer is mad, aggressive, but deep, deep down… she’s really a bad person! I’m already used to it. And I must confess: I really like her that way.

LU	(Laughs)

PIETRO	Give it to me.

LU	Thank you. Pietro, since I’m done with work a little earlier today, I was thinking about leaving, leaving a little earlier.

PIETRO	Funeral or burial?

LU	Do you remember that photographer Carol asked to set a meeting with? I can’t reach him on the phone, so I was thinking about going over his studio…

PIETRO	Neither a funeral nor a burial… you’re having sex, huh? Got it.

CHARLES	I’m actually cute!

RAFAEL	Told you? You’re good enough to be a model.

CHARLES	I’m good enough for a lot of thinks! Terrible joke!

RAFAEL	Oh, how creative, “ham”?

CHARLES	Yeah!

RAFAEL	Right? (Ironic laughter)

CHARLES	I need tell you this: I really love your studio, man.

RAFAEL	Hum.

CHARLES	If I can’t get any gig as a model, I could help you out here. I only do bartending at night.

RAFAEL	So pick that equipment and…

CHARLES	Ok.

RAFAEL	… and put on that corner over there, please? Come back here. Come back here. Come back here. (Laughing)

CHARLES	 (Laughs)

RAFAEL	Not so fast! Put this Hard Drive in that locker for me, please.

CHARLES	Ok. Can I actually put in this drawer?

RAFAEL	No, no, no, this drawer…

CHARLES	Ah. 
Ah!

RAFAEL	No. Don’t touch this, Charles!

CHARLES	What is that, man?

RAFAEL	Charles, don’t touch it.

CHARLES	Trophies?

RAFAEL	(RC)

CHARLES	Dude, did you hook up with all of them?

RAFAEL	No, don’t touch this, Charles!

CHARLES	Uh! (Laughs) I know this one. Isn’t she the one who’s always at the bar, following you?

RAFAEL	Can I see?

CHARLES	Here.

RAFAEL	Yes. This is she, but…

CHARLES	What?

RAFAEL	… we’re done.

RAFAEL	(RC) Oh, oh.

JONATAS	Ok, doctor! It’s a deal. We’re set for tomorrow. We can meet up wherever you want. Yes, we’ll take a bus to Curicica.


ZÉ PEDRO	Are you crazy? Take a bus to Curicica? No way! Let’s do this: we’ll pick up a bus right in front that Riachuelo store, near Arcos. As soon as I get there, I’ll call you, all right? Cool. Bye.

DORINHA	What are you doing in Curicida, my sweet pie?

ZÉ PEDRO	I’m working on a case outside Bastille.

DORINHA	Oh, good! Extra money! You what we should do?

ZÉ PEDRO	“Ham”? 

DORINHA	We can buy a whirlpool, like the one Carol has in the place.

ZÉ PEDRO	Uh! That won’t happen. This work is charity. I’m not getting any money for that.

DORINHA	Oh, Zé Pedro. Are we rich so you can go around doing charity work?

ZÉ PEDRO	I’m not rich, but I’m being cautious. 

DORINHA	Ah. (Complains)

ZÉ PEDRO	My boss’s son asked me.

DORINHA	“Ham”? 

ZÉ PEDRO	You know how things work, right? Tomorrow, the boss’s son will become then new boss.

DORINHA	“Ham”?

ZÉ PEDRO	(Kiss)

DORINHA	Ok. I got it.

ZÉ PEDRO	Yes.

DORINHA	Do you know I call that?

ZÉ PEDRO	“Ham”?

DORINHA	Charity work using other people’s wallets. In that case, using other people’s husbands, right, Zé Pedro?

ZÉ PEDRO	Relax, pumpkin, I know what I’m going to do.

DORINHA	Bye-bye whirlpool. (RC)

JONATAS	Hey, I need to work on something tomorrow. I have to go to Curicica. Do you “wanna” (want to) go with me?

ELIZA	And not work for a whole day? No way! Today was already bad enough.

JONATAS	Well, that’s the reason I invited you. I thought you’re still upset.

ELIZA	I already forgot about it. That’s a lie. I didn’t forget. But if I see that bastard, he’s the ones who will be sad!

JONATAS	Are you “gonna” (going to) be ok by yourself?

ELIZA	Relax. I know how to take care of myself. “Wanna” (want to) eat? 

JONATAS	Ah, the smell is amazing!

ELIZA	Hum. I’m not a good cook like my mom is, you know? But I’m good enough.

JONATAS	Yeah? Let me try this weird thing then.

ELIZA	Hum?

JONATAS	(RC)

ELIZA	What did you say?

JONATAS	Weird thing.

ELIZA	Weird thing? “Aham”

JONATAS	No! No!

ELIZA	I’m “gonna” (going to) let you starve.

JONATAS	But…

ELIZA	I’ll eat by myself.

JONATAS	No. Let me try just a little, redhead? One second. No! Wait! Wait!

ELIZA	Good?

JONATAS	So good!

CHARLES	Thanks, Rafa! I’m “gonna” (going to) take off. I’m late for work. I’ll give you and the hot chick some privacy.

RAFAEL	All right.

LU	It’s not what you’re thinking. I came here for work and I’ll leave right after.

RAFAEL	For work?

CHARLES	For work?

RAFAEL	Yeah. Work.

CHARLES	“Aham”

RAFAEL	Ok! Have a great time at work, Charles!

CHARLES	Have a great time working, Rafa!

RAFAEL	Work? Yeah…

LU	My boss asked me to schedule a meeting with you. Wednesday, 2pm is ok?

RAFAEL	You came all the way here just to say that? You guys don’t have a telephone at the magazine?

LU	You live near my place, so…

RAFAEL	Oh, but don’t you live in Barra?

LU	"Aham". 
“Aham”

RAFAEL	Don’t you also work in Barra?

LU	You want me to leave, is that it?

RAFAEL	No, no. Of course not! For the love of God. I want quite the opposite. Since you came all the way here, don’t you want to have a drink with me?

LU	No, thank you. I still need to drive back home, you know?

RAFAEL	You shouldn’t drink and drive. But, if you want, you can sleep here. It would be the first time.

LU	So the next day you will forget about me? Like you always do?

RAFAEL	“Ham”. You were the one who left the club hugging that huge guy!

LU	Max?

RAFAEL	“Aham”

LU	Ah, Max is gay! (Laughs). I don’t know what happened to him that night.

RAFAEL	He didn’t look gay to me.

LU	Yeah. He did that because he thinks you need to learn a lesson after treating me so bad.

RAFAEL	Am I treating you bad now, huh? Stay, please.

LU	Hold on. If I stay, will you call me tomorrow so we can hang out the next day, again? At least send me flowers? No, I got it! You’re going to send me a text saying that the night was wonderful, and I’m that special?

RAFAEL	Honestly? No.

LU	(RC) Ok. I’ll stay anyway. (Kiss)

LU	(RC) Rafa? Rafa. Hit the door when you leave. Thanks. (RC) That’s it? Ai, Maria Luiza, you’re so dumb!

DEBORA	(Kiss)

HUGO	Honey, say a number, please. But really think about it, huh?

DEBORA	Oh, dad.

HUGO	I already put our birthday dates. So not those numbers.

DEBORA	Ok. Hum. Cobalt twenty seven.

HUGO	“Aham”

DEBORA	Potassium nineteen.

HUGO	Nineteen. 

DEBORA	Plutonium, ninety-four.

HUGO 	What, what is that?

DEBORA	Periodic Table.

HUGO	Oh, ok! Well, I hope this means luck, huh? (Laughs) Oh, before you leave, can you please see if we have any change in the register? If we have enough silverwear. Ok?

DEBORA	But, that, where’s Cassandra? This is my sister’s job! Not mine.

CASSANDRA	My name now is Salamadra, annoying girl.

DEBORA	Ah.

HUGO	Jesus!

DEBORA	Dad, don’t you think we’re “letting the sunshine in” or that “our bar is on fire”? No, no, no. This is my sister’s new hair. Super natural…

CASSANDRA	Wow! You’re so funny, Debora.

DEBORA	Thank you!

CASSANDRA	Daddy! Tell her you like my new hair! Tell her I look great, diva, wonderful and everything she will never be!

DEBORA	(RC)

HUGO	You, you are pretty, darling. It looks great! But I prefer your hair natural. 

CASSANDRA	And what was the color? Guys, I can’t remember. For real! But the past is in the past, right? This is the new me! I mean… I’m Salamandra now. But I’m still myself. I’m confused now.

DEBORA	Tell me something new. Can you stop being a show-off for a while? I need some help…

CASSANDRA	Adele, girl, wait!

DEBORA	You, like…

CASSANDRA	Adele! Adele!

DEBORA	Oh.

CASSANDRA	Hey, girl! I’m calling your name!

DEBORA	Dad, I love this.

CASSANDRA	Psiu! Adele!

DEBORA	I think it’s great when I’m she leaves me here, talking to myself.

ADELE	Cassandra, what happened to your hair?

CASSANDRA	You like it?

ADELE	It looks very different, huh?

CASSANDRA	Different…

ADELE	Dear Lord!

CASSANDRA	… different good, or different bad?

ADELE	do you really want me to answer?

CASSANDRA	Adele, Adele, Adele, Adele, Adele…

ADELE	No, Cassandra.

CASSANDRA	Wait!

ADELE	I’m going to work.

CASSANDRA	Hold on!

ADELE	Ah, Cassandra.

CASSANDRA	You need to focus now. You need to introduce me to Arthur now as Salamandra. The new face…

ADELE	Oh. Oh!

CASSANDRA	… that everyone will love! (Laughs)

ADELE	What do you mean “Salamandra”, Cassandra? What the hell?

CASSANDRA	No…

ADELE	That’s not a possibility!

CASSANDRA	Girl, I’m ready to go to the agency with you!

ADELE	You’re not going to the agency with me. Arthur already decided: it’s a girl who sells flowers in Downtown.

CASSANDRA	He decided? What?

ADELE	He already decided. The agency is looking for that girl. I have got to go, girl, ok? I’m right on time…

CASSANDRA	No! Wait! Girl who sells flowers? Tell me more about that.

ADELE	Yeah, she sells… I’ll tell you more later, Cassandra. Bye!

CASSANDRA	Bye. Girl who sells flowers. Ah…

MAX	Lu? Where did you sleep? With who? Oh, no, Maria Luiza. I know I’m not your mother, girl, but I’m calling you by your full name, because you deserve it! You’re such a cliché, do you know that? Aren’t you ashamed of your self? Huh? Don’t call me anymore. I don’t care! I’m going to walk around the city looking for a girl selling flowers. Look, sweetie, if I get home and you’re crying because of that photographer, I’m moving out! I’m moving out, and you will have a hamster as your new roommate!

MAX (off) 	A hamster is your new roommate!

LU	(RC)

MAX (off)	That’s right, a hamster!

LU	With a hamster, Max?

MAX	Sweetie, listen: get out of this bed, get ready and go to work, ok? Get out! I’m doing the same, ok? Kisses!

MAX (off)	Love you!

LU	(Cry) Love you too! (Cry – RC – Laughs – RC). What a bastard! What a dirty bastard! (RC – Screams) Ah, I’m so stupid! (Cry)

HUGO	Her crazy way brings joy to our lives.

DEBORA	Yeah…

HUGO	Your mom was like that.

DEBORA	Why are you talking about mom? We never talk about her. I don’t remember her at all, by the way.

HUGO	You girls were too young when she left us. It’s been such a long time.

DEBORA	It’s been a long time.

HUGO	But she was like that. Like your sister. She was always talking, a lot of energy, (Laughs) vain, (Laughs) a lot of big plans and she would get new ones every week.

DEBORA	Well, for sure I’m not like my mother.

HUGO	Honey I, I’m not sure if this can be a compliment, but I think you’re like me.

DEBORA	What do you mean “you’re not sure”? Of course it’s a compliment.

HUGO	 (Laughs)

DEBORA	What?... (Laughs) are you, are you ashamed of me?

HUGO	No. (Laughs)

DEBORA	(Laughs)

AMBOS	(Laughs)

HUGO	Go, you should go. I will…

DEBORA	(Laughs)

HUGO	I’ll work on this.

DEBORA	 (Laughs) You’re so silly.

JONATAS	If my mom asks, you’re friends with my boss, doctor Jivago.

ZÉ PEDRO	Oh, all right. Wait a minute, isn’t that a name of an old movie?

JONATAS	Yes, but my mom never watched it. I’m positive.

ZÉ PEDRO	Well, ok, I don’t care. The important thing is that you’re going to say a lot of great stuff about me for your boss’s son if I help your mother.

JONATAS	No problem.

ZÉ PEDRO	This is a Sine Qua Non agreement.

JONATAS	Ok, ok, ok! It’s a deal. If you can make Florisval pay the child support I’ll tell him you’re the best lawyer in the city!

ZÉ PEDRO	Great!

JONATAS	Not amazing. You’re the best lawyer in country!

ZÉ PEDRO	That’s better.

JONATAS	Then I’ll say you’re the best lawyer in the world!

ZÉ PEDRO	Ah, perfect!

JONATAS	(Laughs)

ZÉ PEDRO	Perfect!

ROSÂNGELA	Good morning!

JONATAS	Blessing, mom. (Kiss)

ROSÂNGELA	God bless you, son!

JONATAS	Amen. This is doctor José Pedro, he’s “gonna” (going to) help you.

ROSÂNGELA	Hi, doctor!

ZÉ PEDRO	How are you doing?

ROSÂNGELA	Uh, make yourself at home, ok?

ZÉ PEDRO	Excuse me.

ROSÂNGELA	Hi, doctor!

ZÉ PEDRO	How are you doing?

ROSÂNGELA	Uh, make yourself at home, ok?

ZÉ PEDRO	 “Aham”

JONATAS	So, doctor, these are my siblings. Wesley and Jennifer are Florisval’s kids. Like I told you before.

ZÉ PEDRO	Good morning, guys!

ROSÂNGELA	Don’t be rude! You guys should answer!

WESLEY E JENIFFER	Good morning!

ROSÂNGELA	Would you like a coffee?

ZÉ PEDRO	Oh, please.

ROSÂNGELA	Bola, open some space for the doctor, huh? Turn that video game off, ok?

BOLA	Ok, but why do we need a doctor, mom? Is someone sick or something?

ZÉ PEDRO	No, I’m not a doctor, big boy. I’m a lawyer.

JENIFFER	Why do we need a lawyer?

ROSÂNGELA	Guys, why are you asking so many questions? Hey, you should be in school, right? This is a grown up conversation. Everybody out! Get out. Go, go, go. Everybody!

JONATAS	I’m “gonna” (going to) go with you guys. I “wanna” (want to) see if the school’s principal remembers who I am. 

WESLEY	Oh, she does! She’s always saying: “Jonatas was always a great student!”

JONATAS	(Laughs)

ROSÂNGELA	And his young brother is so different. All he thinks about is to play soccer, right, Wesley?

WESLEY	Are you doing this, already, mom?

ROSÂNGELA	Go!

WESLEY	Bye.

ROSÂNGELA	Bye. (Kiss). Bye, my love.

WESLEY	Bye.

ROSÂNGELA	You also work with doctor Jivago?

ZÉ PEDRO	No, no, but we’re close friends.

ROSÂNGELA	Oh, I see. (RC)

ZÉ PEDRO	But, let’s go to the point: what’s your ex husband full name?

ROSÂNGELA	That bustard’s name is Florisval Pereira. It’s been months since the last time he paid child support. He spends his money with some tramp and keeps making fun of me.

ZÉ PEDRO	That always happens.

ROSÂNGELA	I set e meeting with a Public Defender before…

ZÉ PEDRO	Hum?

ROSÂNGELA	… but Florisval never showed up to the meeting. And I felt sorry for him. I let it go. But enough is enough! He doesn’t pay anything to his kids. I can’t allow this anymore.

ZÉ PEDRO	Well, ma’am, according to the Brazilian law…

ROSÂNGELA	I know. And that’s exactly what I want. I “wanna” put that bastard in jail till he pays me evertything!


FLORISVAL	Hey, hey, hey, hey! “Psiu”! “Wanna” hang out with me? Ah, ah. (Laughs) Ah.

MARISTELA	Every time you see a lady it’s the same thing, huh?

FLORISVAL	What are you doing here? What a nice surprise, my blonde!

MARISTELA	You are crazy, Florisval! You’re completely crazy!

FLORISVAL	Tell me, what’s the big deal? I was just waxing a little more over that area. That’s it!

MARISTELA	 “Ham’. Ok. I’ll pretend I believe you. I don’t “wanna” be stressed this early.

FLORISVAL	Oh, God! What is that? You came all the way here to fight with me? (RC)

MARISTELA	No. I don’t want it. Get off!

FLORISVAL	(RC)

MARISTELA	Let me go! I don’t “wanna” (want to) fight with you. I came because I have a client here in Barra, so came by to visit you here.

FLORISVAL	Oh, yeah?

MARISTELA	Yeah.

FLORISVAL	I had no idea you work at people’s home now.

MARISTELA	Uh, I do that a lot! Some clients prefer privacy at their own place, ok?

FLORISVAL	Privacy?

MARISTELA	At home. They prefer me to wax them in their bedroom.

FLORISVAL	Oh, yeah? God, the bedroom…

MARISTELA	In the bedroom.

FLORISVAL	So come here! (Kiss)

MARISTELA	Where?

FLORISVAL	Come over here. Come over here.

MARISTELA	What?

FLORISVAL	I already know what you’re doing!

MARISTELA	Where do you want me to go?

FLORISVAL	You’re “gonna” (going to) do that Chaplin’s shape for me, huh?

MARISTELA	Where are you going, Florisval?

FLORISVAL	Come here. Come here!

MARISTELA	Oh! Stop it! Where are you going?

FLORISVAL	It will be quick!

MARISTELA	I’m not going!

FLORISVAL	Come!

MARISTELA	There are a lot of people here!

FLORISVAL	Come here.

MARISTELA	You’re so crazy!

FLORISVAL	Chill! No one will se anything!

MARISTELA	(Laughs)

FLORISVAL	Come here.

MARISTELA	Let me go!

FLORISVAL	It will be quick!

MARISTELA	It won’t! You smell so nice!

FLORISVAL	My princess!

MARISTELA	(Kiss). Oh!

FLORISVAL	(RC – Kiss) No. Stop it! Stop it!

MARISTELA	Oh, what?

FLORISVAL	Stop it.

MARISTELA	Why?

FLORISVAL	My boss’s kiss ass secretary! She’s looking at us!

MARISTELA	(RC)

FLORISVAL	Oh my God!

MARISTELA	Jesus!

FLORISVAL	Ah.

LU	Open! Open the window!

FLORISVAL	(RC)

LU	Open! I heard you, ok? First of all, I’m not a secretary!

FLORISVAL	Sorry!

LU	I’m Carolina’s personal assistant.

FLORISVAL	Yeah, persistent.

MARISTELA	Ok.

FLORISVAL	Ok.

MARISTELA	I knew that.	

FLORISVAL	Ok, Lu, Lu. I’m sorry. I was the one who said that.

LU	Second of all, what are you guys doing there?

FLORISVAL	Nothing. We’re getting out now.

MARISTELA	I’m leaving now.

FLORISVAL	She was just explaining me about nails…

MARISTELA	I was just looking for something here.

FLORISVAL	It was just…

LU	Get out, get out, get out!

FLORISVAL	Yeah. No.

LU	Get out!

FLORISVAL	She’s getting out now.

MARISTELA	Hold on.

FLORISVAL	Calm down.

MARISTELA	Be careful with me.

FLORISVAL	She’s just…

LU	What the hell is this, guys?

FLORISVAL	She was teaching me manicure stuff.

MARISTELA	It was something about…

FLORISVAL	Because I have a cuticle problem.

MARISTELA	Calm down.

LU	I can’t believe that…

FLORISVAL	Calm down.

LU	Listen! I’m not in a good mood today to see people caressing each other on the middle of the streets!

FLORISVAL	You’re right.

LU	Got it? Especially right in front of the place I work, ok?

FLORISVAL	No! Ok. Of course! Perfect. I…

LU	All the men behave like children! You’re all a bunch of stupid! That’s what you are: stupid! Sexist! You don’t worth a dime! You’re all the same! You think he’s going to call you tomorrow? You think he’s going to call you the next day? That he’s going to send you flowers? I doubt that!

MARISTELA	Hey, hey, hey, hey!

FLORISVAL	Leave her alone.

MARISTELA	Stop cursing me, you crazy girl! Weirdo! 

FLORISVAL	No, no, no!

MARISTELA	My God!

FLORISVAL	No, no. Leave her…

MARISTELA	What was that, guys?

FLORISVAL	Leave her.

MARISTELA	This girl…

FLORISVAL	Forget about that.

MARISTELA	Jesus!

FLORISVAL	Forget about her, Dear Lord! I need to finish working on this car. Otherwise, she’s “gonna” (going to) complain about me to our boss.

MARISTELA	All right.

FLORISVAL	You should go. Go.

MARISTELA	I’ll go.

FLORISVAL	 (Kiss) Be careful walking on the streets. 

MARISTELA	I’ll see you later, right?

FLORISVAL	Sure, sure. On my place, ok?

MARISTELA	Ok.

FLORISVAL	We can prepare some food over there.

MARISTELA	We will.

FLORISVAL	We can…

MARISTELA	Stay very close together!

FLORISVAL	(kiss) “Aham”. (Kiss). Go, go, go.

MARISTELA	But, hey! I want flowers on the next day!

FLORISVAL	Don’t worry! I got you!

MARISTELA	I hope so!

FLORISVAL	You will see! (RC)

LOBATO	Great…

MAX	Hi!

LOBATO	Hi!

MAX	Hi. Good morning!

LOBATO	Good morning!

MAX	By any chance, have you seen a redhead girl, who sells flowers, around today?

LOBATO	It’s still early. The restaurant is not open yet.

MAX	What time do you think I’ll be able to find her?

LOBATO	Here, during lunchtime. But if you want to find her, go to the flower market now. She’s probably there.

ELIZA	Damn. How come Jonatas finds so many beautiful flowers on the floor? I only see rotten flowers. Ah, Ms. Conceição, there’s no other way. I need to buy a couple today.

CASSANDRA	Look!

ELIZA	How much?

CASSANDRA	This one is a flower meadow, right?

CONCEIÇÃO	Twenty reais.

ELIZA	Twenty?

CASSANDRA	The cheapest one.

CONCEIÇÃO	Yes.

CASSANDRA	Thank you. 

CONCEIÇÃO	Look at the money. It’s “gonna” (going to) fall down. Look!

CASSANDRA	 (RC) I sell flowers! Would you like a flower? No? Good afternoon. Poor me! “Wanna” (want to) buy a flower? Help me. (RC) Flowers? (Laughs)

CONCEIÇÃO	(RC)

CASSANDRA	How much?

CONCEIÇÃO	Fifteen reais.

CASSANDRA	Fifteen?

CONCEIÇÃO	Yes.

CASSANDRA	They are the cheapest ones, right? I do look like a flower seller, right?

CONCEIÇÃO	You look pretty.

CASSANDRA	They are so pretty!

MAX	Jesus! Redhead, holding flowers… That’s probably her, Brazil! Hi!

CASSANDRA	Hi!

MAX	Nice to meet you! Can I talk to you for a second?

CASSANDRA	Would you like to buy some flowers?

MAX	A lot! I would like a lot of flowers!

CASSANDRA	Hum.

MAX	Can we go over there?

CASSANDRA	Of course!

ARTHUR	Adele, I told you I want everyone on the streets looking for the florist?

ADELE	You did, Arthur. You did. I’m sorry, but someone needs to stay in the agency to pick up the phone, at least. We have other work to do as well.

ARTHUR	Yes, but this is the most important one, Adele. You know? The Total Dreamer Girl it’s the magazine’s cover. We have a year contract with Bastille and the most important of all is…

ADELE	I know, Arthur, I know. But a florist works during lunchtime, right? And right now, the restaurants are not open yet. There are no clients for her. Why should I go look for there now?

MAX	Prepare the red carpet so I can walk on it! Because I deserve it! I found her! You can congratulate me, boss! You cry and ask me for something; and I smile and work on it for you!

ARTHUR	Wait, wait, wait! You found my florist? Tell me you did!

MAX	The new Excalibur’s redhead is beautiful! Let her in!

CASSANDRA	Hi! Anyone wants flowers?

CASSANDRA	Are you the one looking for a florist? It’s me.

ARTHUR	You?

CASSANDRA	It’s me!

ARTHUR	What is this crazy girl doing here again?

MAX	Well, you asked for a redhead girl selling flowers in Downtown. And I found her!

ARTHUR	Don’t you recognize this crazy girl?

ADELE	 (RC) I guess I’m going to be fired today.

MAX	Let me take off the flowers and the red hair… Oh, no! My Gosh! You’re Adele’s crazy friend!

ARTHUR	Yes, the one who spilled coffee on me!

ADELE	I have nothing to do with that! I did not bring her!

CASSANDRA	Wait! Wait, guys! This is a mistake! You guys probably think that I’m Cassandra. The girl who was expelled? Everyone thinks I’m her. It’s impressive. No, no. Nice to meet you! My name is Salamandra. I’m a humble and beautiful florist. Isn’t that what you guys want?

ARTHUR	You’re probably thinking that my agency is an asylum, right? Hey, hey, Cassandra! Get out of here!

CASSANDRA	No, I’m Salamandra. I’m Sala…

ADELE	Hey, Cassandra! Just go away!

MAX	Honey, go straight…

CASSANDRA	No.

MAX	… go into the ocean and…

CASSANDRA	No.

MAX	… and good deep…

CASSANDRA	Ok.

MAX	Ok?

CASSANDRA	Arthur, Arthur… give me an opportunity!

MAX	Get out of here, girl!

CASSANDRA	Chill, I…

MAX	Stupid, idiot…

ADELE	(RC)

MAX	I’m so mad!

ARTHUR	Where the hell is my florist?

ELIZA	Flowers?

MOÇA 1	(Laughs)

MOÇO 1	Look at that.

MOÇA 1	(Laughs) It’s the same thing, right?

MOÇO 1	Everyday, the same…

MOÇA 1	Everyday. (Laughs)

MOÇO 1	… thing. Always the same thing.

MOÇA 1	 (Laughs)

MOÇO 1	How are you?

MOÇA 1	(Laughs) Ah.

MOÇO 1	Sorry! We want this one… and that’s it.

GARÇOM	Excuse me.

MOÇA 1	Thank you.

MOÇO 1 E MOÇA 1	(Voices)

MOÇO 1	Every time. Every time we’re here…

MOÇA 1	(Laughs) It’s an absurd!

MOÇO 1 E MOÇA 1	(Voices)

ARTHUR E CAROLINA	(Laughs)

ARTHUR	I can work on the Total Dreamer Girl for you!

CAROLINA	Oh, Arthur, for the love of God!

ARTHUR	I’m telling you!

CAROLINA	It’s a natural beauty, honey. You are, you are…

ARTHUR	Do you know what natural beauty means to me?

CAROLINA	 “Ham”, what is it?

ARTHUR	It’s attitude, magnetism, personality…

CAROLINA	You’re not thinking about making this beggar my new…

ARTHUR	Ah.

CAROLINA	… Total Dreamer Girl, are you?

ARTHUR	You’re crazy!

ELIZA	I told I’m not…

CAROLINA	No!

ELIZA	… a beggar! Nasty lady!

ARTHUR	She is…

CAROLINA	(RC) Look! She’s not even polite!

ARTHUR	 (RC)

CAROLINA	(Laughs)

ARTHUR	I can work on that. Can I see your teeth?

CAROLINA	Wow! Calm down!

ELIZA	Get out!

CAROLINA	Be careful! She still needs to take a vaccine!

ELIZA	Who?

ARTHUR	Such an attitude, huh?

CAROLINA	(Laughs)

ARTHUR	Personality…

CAROLINA	Uh!

ARTHUR	What a hair.

CAROLINA	Jesus! I might get… (Laughing)

ARTHUR	It’s nice.

CAROLINA	… lice. (Laughs)

ARTHUR	It’s nice! Come on, she’s great!

CAROLINA	(Laughs)

ARTHUR	She’s amazing.

CAROLINA	Total Dreamer!

ARTHUR	(Laughs)

CAROLINA	Totally ridiculous!

AMBOS	(Laughs)

ELIZA	(RC) Stupid! You idiot! I thought you were going to help me! (Cry)

MOÇA 1	That’s crazy!

ELIZA	(RC – cry)

MOÇO 1	Girl.

MOÇA 1	Girl.

ELIZA	 (RC)

MOÇO 1	Hey!

MOÇA 1	What is happening?

MOÇO 1	Is everything ok?

MOÇA 1	Calm down. Are you ok?

MOÇO 1	Waiter. Help us, please!

MOÇA 1	My God!

MOÇO 1	Girl!

MOÇA 1	Calm down!

MOÇO 1	Are you ok?

MOÇA 1	Relax. Can I help?

MOÇO 1	Are you ok?

MOÇA 1	Gosh. What a crazy girl.

MOÇO 1	Hey, are you ok? Or not?

ELIZA	I’m sorry.

MOÇA 1	What happened? Calm down.

MOÇO 1	Wow. What happened?

MOÇA 1	Jesus. That girl is crazy. She’s probably going throe a lot. 

JONATAS	So Bastille is here?

ZÉ PEDRO	“Aham”

JONATAS	Cool. Do you know if Fabinho is around?

ZÉ PEDRO	Well, if he is, don’t forget about our deal, huh? Say a lot of good things about me.

JONATAS	No, don’t worry, doctor. It’s really important what you’re doing for my family!
	
ZÉ PEDRO	Speaking of the devil, look: he’s coming. I’m going to leave, so it doesn’t look like I’m pressuring you, ok?

JONATAS	All right. Thank you, doctor.

FABINHO	What’s up, dude?

JONATAS	What’s up? 

FABINHO	What are you doing here?

JONATAS	Well, your dad’s lawyer is “gonna” (going to) help my mom, like you said he would. He’s such a cool guy, huh? He gave me a ride and now I’m going to Downtown.

FABINHO	So, Zé Pedro is helping your mom?

JONATAS	A lot!

FABINHO	Great! That’s good.

JONATAS	The guy is amazing!

FABINHO	Good.
	
JONATAS	Thank you so much, “bro” (brother).

FABINHO	No! Not a problem, dude. That’s the least I could do to pay you back. You saved me, man.

JONATAS	(Laughs) Tell me one thing: is this company yours?

FABINHO	(Laughs)

JONATAS	You in a good place, huh, “bro” (brother)?

FABINHO	(RC) No, it’s my family’s. I don’t have the best relationship with my father, but I come up with some ideas, sometimes. Maybe I’ll be able to convince him to do things differently.

GERMANO	Where were you? In Curicica? Doing a favor for one of Fabinho’s friends? Seriously, Zé Pedro?

ZÉ PEDRO	Actually, it was for the friend’s mother.

GERMANO	Who authorized you to leave?

FABINHO	Mine. Jonatas doesn’t have any money and he helped me a lot when I needed. So, I thought it was not a problem.

GERMANO	But it is. You wasted Zé Pedro’s time. He works at Bastille and makes a lot of money here.

ZÉ PEDRO	Actually, is not a lot, sir.

GERMANO	Quiet! Your mom thinks you have a lot to add in this company, but I think you need to work really hard to prove me you can. And this is not a good start!

FABINHO	What’s the point of proving something, since you think I’m always wrong? What’s the point of working hard? Look, I’m not here to have fun, ok? I also didn’t asked Zé Pedro to help a poor kid as a joke. And if you don’t believe anything I’m saying, I’m going to get out of here, because I’m wasting my time, since you already have an opinion about me. Excuse me!

GERMANO	Fabio, wait! Fabinho! Hold on.

FABINHO	What do you want now?

GERMANO	I want to talk to you!

FABINHO	You want to keep hurting me? Anyway, my mom is the only one who believes you would give me a change.

GERMANO	Ah, it’s not like that. Hold on. You’re right!

FABINHO	What? Wait a minute. Did I hear you right?

GERMANO	Ok, don’t be ironic, all right? You’re my son and I can’t keep thinking that everything you do is wrong. Why are you here today?

FABINHO	You asked me to work on a budget so Bastille would stop polluting the Tamanduá River, right? That’s why I’m here. So I can do everything you asked me: collect data; do a research; I just want to prove that this project is viable.
	
GERMANO	So let’s star over. Come on.

FABINHO	I don’t know if it’s worth my time.

GERMANO	Listen, Fabinho, I’m going to tell you something, even if you don’t believe me: I just want the best for you! The best for you. If I’m tough sometimes, it’s because life is tough. It’s not because you’re my son that I’ll make your life easier.


FABINHO	It’s quite the opposite, right dad? You always make it harder!

GERMANO	And what you going to do? Are you giving up because of this? Why don’t go back to that fabric and prove to your stubborn dad that he is wrong?

FABINHO	All right. I’m not going to give up.

GERMANO	Great. I promise I’ll be fair with you. (RC)

HUGO	What’s wrong, honey? What happened?

CASSANDRA	Everything went wrong, dad! (Cry) Why is everything so hard in my life?

HUGO	Tell me. Who hurt you? I’m “gonna” (going to) go there and break his face!

CASSANDRA	I broke my own face, dad! Again! (Laughs) I think I was dreaming too high. I’ll never make it as a model, much less as the Total Dreamer Girl. Because I’m horrible, dad. I’m horrible! I’m ridiculous!

HUGO	How come can you something like that, honey? You’re beautiful. You can do anything you want with your life.

CASSANDRA	You only say because you love me. But what’s the point of keeping fooling myself? I couldn’t make it even as a Miss Fatima’s Neighborhood. I was in the third place! Don’t you remember? I do. (Crying)
	
HUGO	Oh, my darling. When you talk like that, it breaks my heart.

CASSANDRA	(Cry)

HUGO	Don’t give up on your dreams. Never.

CASSANDRA	(Cry)

HUGO	I already damned my life to work behind this counter, believing I would win the lottery someday. That I will get rich. Thinking about getting Carolina back. And life was passing by, passing by… (RC) Is that what you want for yourself?

CASSANDRA	What? Be like you and stay in this dirty place the rest of my life? (RC) No way! (RC) I mean… dad, this pretty counter, this bar, with nice clients, right? Very clean! (RC) You’re right. I won’t give up. (Laughs) I’ll work my way in that contest.

HUGO	That’s my Sandra, uh, my Cassandra.

CASSANDRA	(Laughs)

HUGO	My, my Salamandra, my crazy girl!

CASSANDRA	(Laughs)

HUGO	And whoever you want to be. (Laughs) That’s my little girl.

CASSANDRA	Thank you, dad.

JONATAS	How was your day?

ELIZA	Terrible. I didn’t sell anything today.

JONATAS	Oh, with that upset face it gets hard to sell flowers, you know?

ELIZA	Yeah, but it’s hard to smile today, ok? (RC) Maybe now I’ll get better. (RC) Tell me, how was everything? Everything ok? Your mom? The lawyer?

JONATAS	I think it was pretty good. Very good. The guy is really cool. He even said he was Jivago’s friend.

ELIZA	Poor Ms. Rosângela. You lie a lot to her.

JONATAS	But it’s for her own good. Doctor Jivago may be a lie, but the lawyer is real. And the guy is good.

ELIZA	(RC)

JONATAS	This time, Florisval has no other option. Either he pays child support, or he’s arrested. That’s the important thing.

JONATAS	Oh, that’s probably the lawyer. No, I guess is from your hometown.

ELIZA	Mom?

GILDA	Honey. I got some money. I’m going to Rio to see you. If everything works out, I’m going tomorrow.

ELIZA	Tomorrow, already?
GILDA	
I was supposed to be there already, don’t you think, Eliza? I know you’re working things out, but I need to see you. I need to see if you’re ok. I’m concerned. I’m your mother.

ELIZA	Keep that money to buy something for the kids, mom. I told you, I’m fine.

GILDA	Only after I see you and make sure you’re really ok. Ok, sure, sure. I, I’m arriving tomorrow, dear cousin. I’m going to Itaboraí to see you, ok? As soon as I arrive, I’ll call you on this number. Yeah. God bless you. See you. Why are you looking me like that, baby? I told you, I need to see my aunt, right?

DINO	I don’t like anything about this trip.

GILDA	Uh, Dino. My aunt is dying. Oh, I’ll come back on the same day. Stop being so jealous, please. There’s no reason for that, babe.

DINO	(RC)

GILDA	(Kiss – Laughs)

DINO	(RC – Laughs)

ELIZA	
What now? What I am “gonna” (going to) tell my mom? Well, because when she realizes I’m living here and working on the streets, she’s “gonna” (going to) lose her mind!

JONATAS	Uh! Now you understand how it is.

ELIZA	What should I do?

JONATAS	The same as I do: lie. But don’t worry about it. (RC) I’m “gonna” (going to) help you. (Laughs – RC) Your mom will believe you have a good life.

AMBOS	(Laughs)

ELIZA	How?

JONATAS	Is that a smile?

ELIZA	(Laughs)

JONATAS	If you go to work like this, you’re “gonna” (going to) sell a bunch of flowers.

ELIZA	Ah.

JONATAS	Let’s go work?

ELIZA	Jonatas, do you think someday I’ll really have a good life? That I’ll be able to bring my mom and my siblings over here?

JONATAS	With that smile, you can do anything you want in the world.

ELIZA	(RC – Laughs) Silly.

JONATAS	(RC)

ELIZA	Let’s go?

JONATAS	“Ham”?

ELIZA	Flowers?

JONATAS	Flowers.

ELIZA	To sell flowers.

JONATAS	To sell flowers, of course! Let’s sell…

ELIZA	Let’s go.

JONATAS	… flowers.

CAROLINA	Hum, we can drop that beauty editorial.

PIETRO	“Aham”.

CAROLINA	It can go on the next month’s issue.

PIETRO	 “Aham”. Well, I think this issue is basically ready. But we’re missing two behavior articles.

CAROLINA	Arthur gave me a great idea for that one: to put a beggar on a magazine cover! What do you think?

PIETRO	Oh, yeah. The bet you guys made. Uff, that again?

CAROLINA	Yes. Again. Once more. Unless that show-off has given up that bet, right?

ARTHUR	What are you talking, Carol? I should give up on the bet? (RC) You’re crazy, aren’t you? I just need to find the florist girl. Everything is ok. We’re working on that. (RC) You’re going to lose that bet and come to work for me, my dear. Hey, don’t talk like that, because I like it, ok? Goodbye. You heard me, right? You heard that if I lose that bet, you lose your job.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
MAX	Oh! Don’t say that, boss!

ARTHUR	So where is my flower girl? The real one.              

MAX	I’m going to solve that problem right now. I’m going to Downtown, walk around, till I find her.

ARTHUR	At this time?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

MAX	Well, if she sells flowers during lunchtime she probably works at night. It’s even better. Full of couples.

ARTHUR	You’re right. You’re right. I’ll go with you.

MAX	Come. Come with me. Come.                                                                                                      

PEÇANHA	Hey, hey, Dino…

DINO E GILDA	 (Kiss – Laughs)

PEÇANHA	Where’re the crumbs?

GILDA	Ouch.

PEÇANHA	I want to put some on the sausage, man!

GILDA	(Laughs)

PEÇANHA	You’ve “gotta” (got to) be kidding me! The service here was better before, huh?

GILDA	Ih!

DINO	Chill, Sheriff! I’m busy with my lady.

GILDA	 (Laughs)

DINO	I’m going! 	 

PEÇANHA	I’m hungry, man!

GILDA	All you do is complain, right?

DINO	(Kiss)

GILDA	Ah, Dino. (Laughs)

DINO	(Kiss) Let me… (Kiss)

GILDA	(Laughs)

DINO	Let me go and I’ll help you.

GILDA	(Laughs)

DINO	Where are the crumbs?

GILDA	It’s here here.

DINO	Here, see?

GILDA	No, not in this can!

DINO	Calm down, Gilda. What is wrong with you?

GILDA	Give me that!

JONATAS	Hey! Don’t you “wanna” (want to) try to sell here?

ELIZA	Hang in there, ok?

JONATAS	Ok.

ELIZA	Flowers? Flowers?

PEDESTRE	 (RC) My God.

MAX	I think we should pull over and walk around to look for her.

ARTHUR	Dude, it’s not allowed to park anywhere around here.

MAX	Yes! I know there’s a place. There’s some place that allows parking. I’m pretty sure. There might be a spot. There might be a spot around here. I’m positive.

ARTHUR	Oh! It’s her!

POLICIAL 1 	Mr. Florisval Pereira?

FLORISVAL	It depends…

POLICIAL 2	It depends? That’s him. According to the picture. You’re arrested, Mr. Florisval.

FLORISVAL	What? (Laughs)

CAROLINA	Since you’re already here…

ZÉ PEDRO	Hum?

CAROLINA	And I know you like to do work outside that office, now it’s my turn to ask.

ZÉ PEDRO	Ask what?

CAROLINA	Can you put a bet in a contract?

PIETRO	(RC)

ZÉ PEDRO	(RC)
 	
DINO	I need more money!

CORREA	Don’t you think it’s time to stop betting when you play pool?

DINO	Who said anything about betting, Correa? I need to buy a new stove. Gilda is always complaining, and she’s right. But she won’t leave me alone!

CORREA	So that was the reason…

DINO	What do you mean?

CORREA	Nothing. Nothing. I meant that this is why she pawned her necklace. Maybe that means Gilda is “gonna” get a new stove with her own money?
