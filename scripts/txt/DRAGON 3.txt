(THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL 3)





GUARD	I said you can’t... Stop…ahh! Shoot! Over here!

PETER THE FIRST	Faster! Go!

GUARD	Take him! Fire! Stop the carriage!

JAMES HOOK	I've been waiting for this for a long time!  You will make a fine specimen in my collection. You’re a great fighter!

MASTER	You’re very strong too.

JAMES HOOK	Just remember, we are still chained to each other. So you are not going anywhere.

GUARDS	No one has ever escaped the Tower.

PETER THE FIRST	So I'm going to be the first.

GUARD	After him! Quick! Faster! Faster!

MASTER	You look better this way!

JAMES HOOK	Ah… You look younger!

MASTER	Do I?

JAMES HOOK	No, no! Don’t touch this! This is the helmet of Genghis Khan!

MASTER	Helmet?

JAMES HOOK	Yes!

MASTER	Pffft! This is the incense pot! So stupid…

JAMES HOOK	No!  This is the spear of Alexander the Great. No, don’t touch that one! No, this is the sword of the Turkish Sultan! No! No! No! No, no, no! No, no!

MASTER	So what should I do?! Good! That’s fair.

PETER THE FIRST	Damn! Where did you come from? 

GUARD	You won’t get away that easy from me!

MISS DUDLEY	Gentlemen, please stop now, or we'll be killed!

GIRL	Goodness! Are you alright? Can I help you?

GUARD	He escaped from the Tower! 

MASTER	Hey, big guy! You are only helping me!

JAMESHOOK	You're helping me get down…

PRISONERS	Look! He's almost at the top! Now run! You're free!

JAMES HOOK	Not today!

MISS DUDLEY	And where is the China man?!  You escaped together! He said, he'd bring Jonathan home!

PETER THE FIRST	I’ll be doing that for him.

MISS DUDLEY	Sure you can do it?

PETER THE FIRST	Yes! I need to return the Seal! I gave him my word!

BOY	Give it back here sir! Oi, give my hat back!

MISS DUDLEY	Are you going to China? Take me with you! Hey! Hey!

PETER THE FIRST	Get out of my way! A Russian ship… What luck! Where is it headed?

SAILOR	To China. And who are you? Why I don’t remember you?

BOATSWAIN	Throw it there near the barrels with Makheevs’s sauce.

SAILOR	Put the grain barrels at the stern, by the water barrels!

BOATSWAIN	Move faster! A tortoise could do it quicker'n you!

SAILOR	Oh, such a pretty lady! What's she doing in a place full of scallywags and|ne'er-do-wells like this?

MISS DUDLEY	Don’t touch me! Take your hands off me! Excuse me, ladies, could you tell me how to book passage on the Russian ship?

PROSTITUTE	Oh, Russian sailor!… 

MISS DUDLEY	Oh, stop it! Stop it!

RUSSIAN SAILOR	What are you doing? I'll go if I damn well please! Ladies …I’ll be sailing soon. So I’ll need something to drink  and someone pretty to share it with.

MISS DUDLEY	Well… It looks like I have no choice…

RUSSIAN SAILOR	That's a ruble. I could buy a fine mare in Moscow for that!

MISS DUDLEY	Hey! Russian! Mmm?




MISS DUDLEY	Will you take me to your ship?

RUSSIAN SAILOR	A woman on a ship means trouble. I’m in a hurry! 

MISS DUDLEY	I'm in a hurry too! Quickly then! Let's go!

SIRKO	Where is the captain's case of whiskey? And just who are you?

ZHONG BROTHERS	This gentleman hired us.

MAKHEEV	Yes, yes, let them through!

SPIRID	What’s that?

MISS DUDLEY	Whiskey.

CAPTAIN	Stop! This is mine! Come with me, sir! Where are you going? Come back here! Stop! Put it down. Single-malt?

MISS DUDLEY	Yes, sir...

CAPTAIN	So you know your whiskeys, do you?…

MISS DUDLEY	Yes, I do.

BOATSWAIN	Makheev, are you sure this is the captain who will take us to China?

CAPTAIN	Pour me! Appreciated!

MAKHEEV	It's written all over his face: "World cruise!"

CAPTAIN	Now you!

MAKHEEV	I found him at the port tavern, haunt of all the old sea dogs…

BOATSWAIN	Cast off the lines! You, landlubbers! Clear the moorings!

RUSSIAN SAILOR	Stop! You forgot me! Stop! I am Russian! You forgot me!  Don’t leave me here!... Wait! Wait!

CAPTAIN	Sail on!

BOATSWAIN	Faster! Spread the sails! 

JAMES HOOK	Let’s see how you train this time around!

JONATHAN GREEN	Dear Miss Dudley, I proceed on my journey to the East. The longing in my heart for you grows with the distance between us.  My way is filled with dangers and leads me anywhere, but home. Now we are crossing the Baikal, the most beautiful lake in the entire world! I leave Russia heavyhearted. The future of this country without the real Peter the Great is gloomy and unknown.

PETER THE FIRST	What's the Captain's name? Which port does this ship belong to?

BOATSWAIN	What did you drink, you tin scarecrow?!  The bucket is used for completely different purposes on this ship.

PETER THE FIRST	What are you laughing , dirty servants? Kneel before your Tsar!

BOATSWAIN	Woah!

PETER THE FIRST	And you, call the Captain! 

BOATSWAIN	He's right here! 

PETER THE FIRST	Where?

BOATSWAIN	Here!

PETER THE FIRST	Where? I don't see him!

CAPTAIN	Blah-blah-blah-blah! 

PETER THE FIRST	What is it? 

CAPTAIN	Where the heck is he from? Figures, throw this trash in the hole!

PETER THE FIRST	You are here, Mi... 

SAILOR	Well done! Smack on the gob!
