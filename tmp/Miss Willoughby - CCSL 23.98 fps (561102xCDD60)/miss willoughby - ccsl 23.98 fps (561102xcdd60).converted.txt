JACK WILLOUGHBY	09/11/1952 13/07/1996
BUTLER TO YOUNG ROBERT)	Welcome back, sir.
(CONT'D)	May I be of any further assistance?
YOUNG ROBERT TO BUTLER)	Thank you, we'll manage from here.
MAID TO YOUNG ROBERT)	- Very good, sir.
MAID TO YOUNG ROBERT)	- We'll leave you now, sir.
YOUNG ROBERT)	Why was your uniform different
YOUNG ROBERT)	to everybody else's?
WILLOUGHBY)	Because they served in the British Army
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	and I served in the US Marines,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	which is how I met your father.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	We served together overseas.
YOUNG ROBERT)	I didn't know that.
WILLOUGHBY)	Goodnight, Lizzie.
YOUNG ROBERT)	What do you want me to do with her,
YOUNG ROBERT)	Jack?
WILLOUGHBY)	What is it, today?
YOUNG ROBERT)	Terpsichore, the fifth
YOUNG ROBERT)	of the Herodotus histories.
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Right now, the Megabazus
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	are thrashing the Thracians.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	Sounds pretty bloody.
YOUNG ROBERT)	It is, Robert, it's frightful.
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Are you dragging me out now?
WILLOUGHBY)	We made a deal.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	You can spend the morning reading
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	if you spend the afternoon exercising.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	You've got to get the heart pumping.
YOUNG ROBERT)	Can't I just kick a ball around instead?
WILLOUGHBY)	This is all about your confidence, Lizzie.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	This is all about you
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	not having to be afraid.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	Now, you're right handed,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	so your left shoulder'll face
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	the opponent,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	legs shoulder width apart, knees bent.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	Okay, one, two.
WILLOUGHBY)	- I feel stupid.
WILLOUGHBY)	- Well you're not.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	Pretend you're…
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	thrashing the Thracians.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	That's it, left-right.
(CONT'D)	Remember, when you see a good move
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	look for a better one.
YOUNG ROBERT)	Emanuel Lasker beat
YOUNG ROBERT)	William Steinitz in 1894
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	to win the World Chess Cup.
WILLOUGHBY TO YOUNG ROBERT)	- I am impressed.
WILLOUGHBY TO YOUNG ROBERT)	- Not really.
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	You tell me every time.
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	I was reading Appian today,
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	the Battle of Zama, those poor
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	elephants!
WILLOUGHBY)	Forget about them. It's Scipio's
YOUNG ROBERT)	Robert! I could never forget
YOUNG ROBERT)	about the elephants!
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Oh, for goodness' sake, Robert!
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Make your move and stop pretending
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	that you're going to let me win!
WILLOUGHBY)	Left-right.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	One, two, three.
YOUNG ROBERT TO LAURA)	Goodbye, Laura.
YOUNG ROBERT TO LAURA)	Thank you for everything.
LAURA TO YOUNG ROBERT)	Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.
WILLOUGHBY)	What is it this time?
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	The wooing of the Amazons by the
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	Scythes?
YOUNG ROBERT)	That was last night. Great Expectations.
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Estella's being vile to poor old Pip.
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Are you going to go away, Robert,
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	like everyone else?
YOUNG ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Are you going to leave me like Laura?
WILLOUGHBY)	No, no I'm staying here with you.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	I'm your guardian. It's what your mother
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	and father instructed in their will.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	I have no reason to argue.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	When you're an adult
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	and you're running the house
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	and the estate,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	then it'll be up to you,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	but for now, you're stuck with me.
YOUNG ROBERT)	Good.
WILLOUGHBY)	Lights out, Lizzie.
YOUNG MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Hah! Hah! Hah!
YOUNG MISS WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D	Hah! Hah!
YOUNG ROBERT)	Aah!
YOUNG MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Hah!
__VOICEOVER	
YOUNG MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Yes!
YOUNG MISS WILLOUGHBY TO COW	Oh, shut up!
YOUNG MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Hah! Hah! Hah!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO COW)	Oh, shut up!
WILLOUGHBY)	- Thank you, Andrew.
WILLOUGHBY)	- Ms. Willoughby.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL)	And so, through a lethal
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL)	combination of death,
__VOICEOVER	extreme hubris and rampant ambition,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	the first Triumvirate ceased to exist,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	and clearly, politics
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	hasn't evolved that much
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	in the past 2,000 years.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	That's all for today,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	I'll get you the reading list
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	for tomorrow morning.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	Please find time in your busy social lives
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	to have a look at it.
__VOICEOVER	I am so proud of the lot of you.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	You bring me such joy.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	Oliver! How lovely to hear from you.
[VO])	I've been meaning to pop by the shop.
THEN OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY	- How are you? How's Helen?
THEN OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY	- I am well, thanks.
(CONT'D)	Yes, um, Helen's…
(CONT'D)	okay. She's okay.
(CONT'D) [VO])	Uh, the reason that I'm calling
(CONT'D) [VO])	is the books have arrived.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Oh, marvelous.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- And I wondered if
(CONT'D)	I couldn't swing by and drop them off?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	Oh, you really don't need to do that.
(CONT'D)	No, no, no, honestly,
(CONT'D)	sweetheart, it's no trouble.
(CONT'D)	Actually, we're headed
(CONT'D)	in your direction tomorrow, so…
(CONT'D)	To be frank, Lizzie,
(CONT'D)	it would be good to talk.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	Is everything alright?
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I, I'd rather say in person.
[VO])	Oh, of course.
(CONT'D)	Why don't you come around tea time?
(CONT'D)	It's a good excuse for cake.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Well, cake would be great.
THEN MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER	- Thank you.
THEN MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER	- Marvelous, I'll see you then.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	See you then.
MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Hm.
OLIVER TO HELEN)	Well.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I understand we're expecting
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	company tomorrow?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Yes, I've got a call from Oliver Deakin.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	He and Helen are popping 'round with
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	those
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- first editions he found me.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Aah.
(CONT'D)	I haven't seen Helen in a while.
(CONT'D)	Her father,
(CONT'D)	Brigadier Ronald, wonderful old chap,
(CONT'D)	and a good friend to your father.
(CONT'D)	He was in Burma under Wingate,
(CONT'D)	uh, Chindits.
(CONT'D)	There was some controversy,
(CONT'D)	but I'd say that they were among
(CONT'D)	the bravest and the toughest.
(CONT'D)	Do you remember him?
(CONT'D)	Ah, that's a shame.
(CONT'D)	Tiny, but utterly fearless.
(CONT'D)	You know, he never did approve
(CONT'D)	of Helen marrying Oliver,
(CONT'D)	used to say his eyes
(CONT'D)	were too close together.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Oh, dear, well, they're coming for tea.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	And?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	And…
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	there'll be cake?
__VOICEOVER	And?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	And what?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Gah! You're no fun,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I can't keep anything from you.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Something's up. Oliver wasn't himself.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	In what way?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- You'll laugh.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Try me.
__VOICEOVER	He called me "sweetheart".
(CONT'D)	I've known him for 20 years,
(CONT'D)	he's never called me sweetheart.
(CONT'D)	He's just not the type.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Let me clarify a little something for you.
(CONT'D)	All men are the type.
HELEN TO ALL)	So, what do you make of Philip?
HELEN TO ALL) (CONT'D)	Does the author intend us
HELEN TO ALL) (CONT'D)	to feel sympathy for him?
2 TO ALL)	Oh, sympathy? With Rachel throwing
2 TO ALL)	herself
2 TO ALL) (CONT'D)	at him? Lucky sod!
DIANA TO ALL)	I think it's obvious
DIANA TO ALL)	we're meant to despise Philip
DIANA TO ALL)	for the weak man-child that he is.
SARAH)	- That's a bit harsh.
SARAH)	- He's so whiny
DIANA TO SARAH) (CONT'D)	and so love-struck.
__VOICEOVER	had anything to do with him.
5 TO DIANA THEN SARAH TO DIANA)	- She was playing him.
5 TO DIANA THEN SARAH TO DIANA)	- We've all known women
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	like Rachel, women with a certain
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	amount
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	of superficial beauty
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	but little intelligence
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	using men, and then
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	throwing them away on a whim,
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	or worse, driving them mad,
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	never mind if they're
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	someone's husband, family men!
DIANA TO SARAH)	Ooh, Sarah,
DIANA TO SARAH)	you're speaking from experience?
__VOICEOVER	Absolutely not. Don't be absurd.
SARAH TO DIANA)	I'm just saying
SARAH TO DIANA)	that Philip is a victim in all this.
SARAH TO DIANA)	Rachel is a predator.
DIANA TO SARAH)	And of course, she's punished
DIANA TO SARAH)	for her sexuality--
DIANA)	- Perhaps we should just--
DIANA)	- She's punished for using
SARAH TO DIANA)	her sexuality to destroy people's lives,
DIANA TO SARAH)	- quite rightly!
DIANA TO SARAH)	- Oh, come on!
DIANA TO SARAH) (CONT'D)	Philip gave her the jewels,
DIANA TO SARAH) (CONT'D)	she didn't ask for them.
SARAH)	- Not directly, no.
SARAH)	- Now you're being obtuse.
HELEN TO ALL)	And on that note, I think
HELEN TO ALL)	we should call it a night.
HELEN TO SARAH)	Excuse me. Sarah.
HELEN TO SARAH)	Are you alright to drive?
SARAH TO HELEN)	No, I'm alright. Fine.
__VOICEOVER	Thank you. Thank you.
MAN TO HELEN)	Thank you.
HELEN TO DIANA)	I think you've upset her.
DIANA TO HELEN)	Ah, Sarah ought to live
DIANA TO HELEN)	in the real world for a change,
DIANA TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	it's not all gin and jacks and bridge,
DIANA TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	but you know that, don't you, Helen?
DIANA TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	You're such a free spirit.
DIANA TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Such a dear friend.
HELEN)	Hello?
HELEN) (CONT'D)	Is anyone there?
HELEN) (CONT'D)	Please.
__VOICEOVER	
ROBERT TO HELEN)	- Thank you.
ROBERT TO HELEN)	- Hi!
HELEN)	- So good to see you.
HELEN)	- Helen!
ROBERT TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Aw, you have missed me, haven't you?
__VOICEOVER	Come.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Hello, darling.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Nothing's changed.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Comforting, isn't it?
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Yeah.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	So lovely to be here, Willow.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	You know, you're practically
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	the only person
(CONT'D)	who still calls me that.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, you don't mind?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Of course not, it's lovely.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	We have such fond memories
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	of this place, Lizzie.
(CONT'D)	Your parents, such a tragedy.
OLIVER)	- Hm.
OLIVER)	- You two met each other here?
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	Ah, no, no, but Helen
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Oh, Helen, you didn't?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Well,
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'd still be waiting
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	if I'd left it to him.
OLIVER TO ALL)	She, she's probably right.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	How's the, the estate managing, Lizzie?
(CONT'D)	I expect it runs itself?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	Oh well, that's Robert's domain.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	I just sign the checks.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Yes well, we've had to make some
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	changes over the past few years,
__VOICEOVER	but I've brought in young Matthew
__VOICEOVER	Cridick.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	He's worked out wonderfully well.
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	Ah well, it is a business
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	like anything else.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	Yes, how's the bookshop?
(CONT'D)	I mean, do people even buy books
(CONT'D)	anymore?
(CONT'D)	I'm appalled at the gaps
(CONT'D)	in some of my students' reading.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	It's not easy.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	What is it, Oliver?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	It's not Oliver, it, it's me.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'm sorry, it's just that we couldn't
(CONT'D)	think of anybody else to talk to.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Well, there's nothing
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	that you can't tell us.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I've been having
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	these weird experiences,
(CONT'D)	encounters, I suppose you could call
(CONT'D)	'em.
(CONT'D)	I think I'm being haunted.
(CONT'D)	I think I'm being haunted
(CONT'D)	by my dear old dad.
(CONT'D)	Now, I know how it sounds.
__VOICEOVER	when I was closing up the shop,
(CONT'D)	only this time, I saw something
(CONT'D)	afterwards, from outside.
(CONT'D)	Someone in the shop, I'm sure.
(CONT'D)	I don't know what to think.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	Have you seen anything, Oliver?
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Uh no, no, but that
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	doesn't mean it didn't happen.
ROBERT)	Ah.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Oliver, old chap,
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	why don't I show you some of the
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	we've made in the cellar?
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	Oh yes, yes, of course.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	We added more room,
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	which of course means more wine.
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	Ah, marvelous.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	I suspect Robert will introduce Oliver
(CONT'D)	to a glass of single malt on the way.
(CONT'D)	Oh, Helen, please don't.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'm sorry.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Don't cry, I'm sure it's nothing.
(CONT'D)	There's an explanation
(CONT'D)	for everything under the sun.
(CONT'D)	Why don't you start at the beginning?
WILLOUGHBY)	- When did it first happen?
WILLOUGHBY)	- Ah.
(CONT'D)	Well, it was a couple of months ago.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	And these encounters, they've
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	only ever happened at the shop?
(CONT'D)	The odd book moving, things
(CONT'D)	not being where they should be.
(CONT'D)	I became aware of things
(CONT'D)	in my peripheral vision,
(CONT'D)	just there.
(CONT'D)	Recently…
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Go on.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, it's the weirdest thing,
(CONT'D)	but sometimes there's this distinct smell
(CONT'D)	and it's my father.
(CONT'D)	He always wore this particular cologne
(CONT'D)	from a perfumery in Provence.
(CONT'D)	I'd turn a corner in the shop
(CONT'D)	and the smell would just hit me
(CONT'D)	and it's as though
(CONT'D)	he's standing right there.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	And it couldn't be another
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	customer wearing the same scent?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I doubt it. The perfumery went
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	out of business in the late 90s.
(CONT'D)	I remember my dad using
(CONT'D)	the last of it one Christmas.
(CONT'D)	I must sound insane.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Oh, so what if you are?
(CONT'D)	We're all a little bit potty.
(CONT'D)	It's what makes life so interesting.
(CONT'D)	Have you told anybody else about this?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Well, I'm seeing a psychiatrist.
(CONT'D)	It was Oliver's idea.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Well, that's good. How's it going?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Dr. Shirani's alright.
(CONT'D)	She can be a bit cold at times, but--
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Dr. Gaya Shirani?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	- Oh, do you know her?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	- Um…
(CONT'D)	I used to, yes.
(CONT'D)	Has she given you any medication?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Just some mild anxiety medication,
(CONT'D)	when it all gets too much.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, do they? I don't know.
(CONT'D)	I suppose it must be.
(CONT'D)	I'm just so exhausted.
(CONT'D)	I spend all my time waiting
(CONT'D)	for it to happen again.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Do you want me to see what I can do?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- What do you mean?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Well, there's a logical
(CONT'D)	explanation for this, I know there is.
(CONT'D)	Do you want me to see if
(CONT'D)	I can get to the bottom of it?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, you can't. I mean, your work.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	- I couldn't possibly…
(CONT'D)	You were so kind to me when I was little
(CONT'D)	after my parents died.
(CONT'D)	I haven't forgotten.
(CONT'D)	Please let me help you.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Thank you.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	I still can't believe you remember
(CONT'D)	Daddy calling me Willow.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Your father copied mine.
(CONT'D)	His special name for me was Bella.
__VOICEOVER	too.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Huh. That's so sweet.
(CONT'D)	I don't think I've ever heard
(CONT'D)	anybody call you Bella,
(CONT'D)	not even Oliver.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	No, I've never told him.
(CONT'D)	I've never told anyone.
(CONT'D)	It was just between my father and me,
(CONT'D)	and now I've told you.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Well, I'm glad.
(CONT'D)	Now…
(CONT'D)	why don't we have some of that cake
(CONT'D)	before the boys come back and eat it all
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Poor Helen seems very fragile.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	You've known her longer than I have.
(CONT'D)	Is this in her character?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	It certainly wasn't in her father's.
(CONT'D)	I never knew her mother.
(CONT'D)	You noticed the shaking?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Yes.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- It's not alcohol.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- You're sure?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I couldn't smell it on her breath.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	More likely it's the anti-anxiety
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	medication she's on.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	So, we're in the business
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Do I detect a teeny-weeny
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	degree of cynicism?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Can you blame me?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I know it's an unusual one, but…
(CONT'D)	I haven't had a case to work on for ages
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	This isn't a case.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Indulge me.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Where will you start?
MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I don't quite know yet.
CAROLE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Good morning, Carole.
CAROLE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Morning!
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I take it you have a plan?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I take it you found the spirit level?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You do know they have nothing
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	to do with actual spirits?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ANDREW)	Thank you, Andrew.
ANDREW TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You have a nice day, Ms. Willoughby.
MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Let's go.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Everything seems alright
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	with your electrics.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Yeah, I told you.
(CONT'D)	There is no explanation.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Not yet.
(CONT'D)	Hm.
(CONT'D)	Do these shelves move?
(CONT'D)	Huh, they did.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	They haven't been touched for years.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Hm.
HELEN TO MAN)	If you need any help,
HELEN TO MAN)	they'll help you at the desk.
THE HELEN TO MAN)	- Thank you.
THE HELEN TO MAN)	- Anything?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Bubble gum.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Ah.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Where exactly did the books
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	start flying off the shelves?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	It was, it was around here.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Sometimes, I catch this look in his eye.
(CONT'D)	He thinks I'm going mad.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	He's just worried about you, that's all.
(CONT'D)	Now where exactly am
(CONT'D)	I supposed to be looking?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	It was around the Greek mythology
(CONT'D)	I think.
(CONT'D)	I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
(CONT'D)	It's all a bit hazy.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	It's okay.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	God help us. Sorry Willow,
(CONT'D)	will you excuse me?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Sure.
HELEN TO DIANA)	Ah, Diana.
DIANA TO HELEN)	- Can I help you?
DIANA TO HELEN)	- Hi Helen,
DIANA TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	have you got my, um, first edition?
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- I'm so sorry.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- You really shouldn't
(CONT'D)	just step back like that.
(CONT'D)	What were you thinking?
(CONT'D)	And in those boots!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	Oh, um, here.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I know you! You're Elizabeth Willoughby
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Yes, I am.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- I did enjoy your last book.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Informative, yet accessible,
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	which is so rare in non-fiction.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	It's always nice to meet a fan.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Sarah Clarkson, and I wouldn't say
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'm a fan, exactly.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	Oh. Um, I think this might be yours.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, you can have it.
(CONT'D)	It's some harebrained project
(CONT'D)	of Diana Branson.
(CONT'D)	For an intelligent woman,
(CONT'D)	she really does have
(CONT'D)	some ludicrous notions,
(CONT'D)	but given the circumstances,
(CONT'D)	well, she might be desperate.
(CONT'D)	Now that we've been introduced, I
(CONT'D)	wonder,
(CONT'D)	I might as well come out with it.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	- I've written a book.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	A family history,
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I suppose you could call it.
(CONT'D)	I come from a long line of accountants.
(CONT'D)	I wondered if you could read it for me?
(CONT'D)	Tell me if it's any good.
__VOICEOVER	Oh good Lord. Helen?
(CONT'D)	Helen! Helen?
HELEN)	- My pills, Ollie!
HELEN)	- For God's sake, Helen, stop.
__VOICEOVER	Here, sweetheart.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Take a deep breath.
OLIVER TO HELEN)	What is it? What?
WILLOUGHBY)	I saw him again! He was here!
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Who? Who did you see?
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- My father!
(CONT'D)	It was him standing right there.
ROBERT TO BRIONY)	If you don't mind, Briony, please?
BRIONY TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Thank you, Briony.
BRIONY TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Thank you, Ms. Willoughby.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Robert, there's something
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I need to talk to you about,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	and I don't want you
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	to take it the wrong way.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh dear. Not sure
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I like the sound of this.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	No, don't be silly, it's just, well…
(CONT'D)	the thing is, you've been looking
(CONT'D)	after me for 25 years now,
(CONT'D)	and you've basically put
(CONT'D)	your own life on hold--
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'm not having this conversation.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	But, I worry about you
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	and I want you to be happy.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I am happy.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	But, do you not want to marry, or…
__VOICEOVER	do something different?
__VOICEOVER	I feel like I've been selfish
(CONT'D)	and I've held you back
(CONT'D)	from the life that you could have led.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- This is my life.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- I'm just saying,
(CONT'D)	if you did want to move on, I'd be okay,
(CONT'D)	and you should do it now whilst
(CONT'D)	you're still yo-- healthy.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I… am not that decrepit.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	You know what I mean.
(CONT'D)	Matthew's settled
(CONT'D)	into running the estate and
(CONT'D)	you could travel,
(CONT'D)	you could go back to America.
(CONT'D)	Find a nice young lady
WILLOUGHBY)	- Palm Beach.
WILLOUGHBY)	- Do you want me to go?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	No, I knew you'd say that.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Lizzie…
(CONT'D)	when Jack and Mary died
(CONT'D)	and I was left to look after you,
(CONT'D)	I was terrified.
(CONT'D)	What did I know about
(CONT'D)	bringing up a child?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	You were brilliant,
(CONT'D)	but I'm an adult now.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Are you saying
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	you don't need me?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	No, of course not.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You don't seem to understand
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	what you've become to me.
(CONT'D)	I could not be prouder
(CONT'D)	of the woman that you've become.
(CONT'D)	Nothing makes me happier.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Just promise me
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	you'll think about it.
(CONT'D)	Promise me you won't sacrifice
(CONT'D)	your happiness for mine,
(CONT'D)	because it'll be okay,
(CONT'D)	you know, I'd manage.
__VOICEOVER	Of course you would.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	And I'm only saying this
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	because I love you.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I know.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- So that's settled.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Settled.
(CONT'D)	But I'm not going anywhere.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	But you could if you wanted to.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- I don't want to.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- But you might change your mind.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- I won't change my mind.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- But you never know--
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	If you keep this up, I will go.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I won't mention it again.

MURRAY)	Is this is a good time?
WILLOUGHBY)	Yes, of course, absolutely,

WILLOUGHBY)	when you want to pick my brain?
MURRAY)	Oh I don't, do I?
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	Well, maybe,
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	but I did bring you these.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	Aah! Oh!
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	And this offering
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	isn't because you called
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	my work pseudo-scientific
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	claptrap?
TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Oh Vernon, please don't.
TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Oh, I'm only teasing.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	I mean, it is what people are saying,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	you may as well be right.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	Ooh, well, what is it?
MURRAY)	Well, I have a friend.
WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, ah, the mythical,

MURRAY)	No, really,

MURRAY) (CONT'D)	she's a dear woman but
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	she seems to have got herself
WILLOUGHBY)	- into a bit of a state.
WILLOUGHBY)	- Mh-hm, tell me.
MURRAY)	She claims to be haunted
MURRAY)	by the ghost of her father.
WILLOUGHBY)	How long has he been passed?
MURRAY)	Um, 20 years or so.
WILLOUGHBY)	And she doesn't have
WILLOUGHBY)	history of hysterics?
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	She's, uh…
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	not a lover of drama
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	or a narcissist?

MURRAY)	- or psychotropic drugs?
MURRAY)	- No.
WILLOUGHBY)	Alcohol consumption?
TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Negligible.
TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- And you believe her story?
MURRAY)	I believe…
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	that certain unexplained
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	incidents have occurred, yes.
WILLOUGHBY)	And are these incidents
WILLOUGHBY)	unexplained because they are…
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	unexplainable,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	or because you haven't found
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	an explanation?
MURRAY)	I honestly don't know, Vernon.
WILLOUGHBY)	Yes, you do.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	You're just too polite
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	to tell me to my face.
MURRAY)	I deal in facts, not conjecture.
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	I think a logical
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	explanation is more likely.
WILLOUGHBY)	So why do you come to me?
MURRAY)	Because my friend is in pain
MURRAY)	and I want to help her.
WILLOUGHBY)	I'm not your man.
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	She smells him, Vernon,
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	when he is there,
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	she smells his cologne,
MURRAY) (CONT'D)	a specific cologne to him.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	You know, I was bored,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	you'd lost me, but this,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	this rings all the bells.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	It's an olfactory
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	experience, this,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	this is an incredibly powerful one.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	Have I talked to you
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	about Morphic Resonance?
TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Um, focus, Vernon.
TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Sorry, sorry, sorry, yes.

WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	You'll find messages online.
__VOICEOVER	some firewalls, but,
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	perhaps you can use a proxy.

ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Thought you could do

ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oliver called.
(CONT'D)	He said Helen
(CONT'D)	was doing much better.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Good.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	So, how far have you got?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I don't know.
(CONT'D)	I mean, look at this.
(CONT'D)	The Rogers' Foundary, 1996.
(CONT'D)	A night watchman was fired
(CONT'D)	for being drunk on duty
(CONT'D)	because he claims he saw
(CONT'D)	the ghost of a former employee
(CONT'D)	who died in an accident,
(CONT'D)	and then, the following year,
(CONT'D)	on the same day, his replacement
(CONT'D)	makes the same claim.
(CONT'D)	And the next year, and the next.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Yes, Lizzie, but--
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Oh,
(CONT'D)	the Docklands Drownings, 2003.
(CONT'D)	Five independent witnesses,
(CONT'D)	all call 999
(CONT'D)	because they saw a woman
(CONT'D)	drowning
(CONT'D)	in the same part
(CONT'D)	of the Thames,
(CONT'D)	but over a six month period.
(CONT'D)	The same screams,
(CONT'D)	the same clothes,
(CONT'D)	but no body was ever found and
(CONT'D)	no missing persons reports and--
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	People drown
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	and are never found.
(CONT'D)	It happens all the time.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	The Enfield Poltergeist.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Ah, I know about that one,
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	the sisters,
(CONT'D)	they were making it up,
(CONT'D)	weren't they?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I just, I mean,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I don't know, at this point. I--
(CONT'D)	The Myrtle's Plantation, I--
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I think you need
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	to take a break.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Yes.
(CONT'D)	I'm not saying
(CONT'D)	I believe in ghosts.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	So, what are you saying?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I'm saying that the individuals
(CONT'D)	who witness these events
(CONT'D)	do believe in them.
(CONT'D)	All sane, rational people,
(CONT'D)	and they may be mistaken
(CONT'D)	and there's
(CONT'D)	a logical explanation, but…
(CONT'D)	they're not lying.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	And is that what
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	you're going to say to Helen?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	If she thinks she is being
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	haunted by Ronald, then she is?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	No, of course not.
(CONT'D)	It's just,
(CONT'D)	after reading all this bunkum,
(CONT'D)	it's made me even more
(CONT'D)	determined to find an answer.
(CONT'D)	I'm not going to let it
(CONT'D)	get the better of me.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	That's my girl.
(CONT'D)	You're going
(CONT'D)	to want to finish that.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Where are you taking me,
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Lizzie?
(CONT'D)	They're rerunning Heroes of
(CONT'D)	Telemark for the umpteenth time,
(CONT'D)	yet I am
(CONT'D)	still eager to watch it.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- I've made you an appointment.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- With whom?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Dr. Gaya Shirani.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You stole her boyfriend.
THE ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY	- She set fire to my lab-coat.
THE ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY	- And why, exactly,
__VOICEOVER	do I have an appointment
__VOICEOVER	with the pyromaniac?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Because, Robert,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	you've been seeing ghosts.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	How long
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	have you been experiencing
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	these apparitions, Mr. Thompson?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Over the past several months.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	They just… pop up
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	when I least expect it.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	And has this ever
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	happened before?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Good God, no.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	And have you suffered a trauma
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	recently or aggrievement?
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	These events can trigger
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	huge shifts in the psyche.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Nothing comes to mind.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	I think you'd remember.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Yes.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	Of course, no.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	No trauma.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	My doctor did give me
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	some pills recently and, um,
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	I think they might
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	be making it worse.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	Could they do that, you think?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI (CONT'D)	Could they be giving me
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI (CONT'D)	hallucinations, for example?
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	Is that what's happening?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Yes, all the time.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	What were you prescribed?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Um.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Yeah.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	It's, uh, hang on.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	It's pro--
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	pro, yeah, Propram--
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Propranolol.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	It's a beta blocker,
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	often prescribed
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	for panic attacks,
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	but it rarely causes
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	hallucinations or
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	any kind of delusional behavior.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	What was his name, by the way?
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- Who?
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- Your doctor.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Foster.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	Dr. Foster?
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Was he in Gloucester
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	by any chance?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Yes, do you know him?
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	Of course,
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	having said that Propranolol
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	is unlikely
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	to cause delusions,
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	there's always
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	the exception to the rule.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Hm.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	Tell me more about Dr. Foster.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Well, there's really
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	nothing much to say.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	Then tell me about yourself.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	Your childhood.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Oh, you don't want
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	to hear about that.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	I do.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Well, it was, uh…
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	a perfectly normal childhood.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	It was a happy childhood.
THEN DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- I laughed a lot.
THEN DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- Brothers and sisters?
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- I was an only child.
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- And yet you laughed a lot?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	With my dog.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	I had a dog.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	He made me laugh.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	Heh, it was a great dog.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	- Was your dog your only friend?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	- No.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	Yes.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	Yes, I suppose, he was.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	You know, I don't really see
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	what this has to do with
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	my seeing ghosts,
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	I mean this was 50 years ago.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Our childhoods mold our lives.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	The seeds of psychosis are
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	planted when we are very young.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Tell me, did you have
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- Doesn't everybody?
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- I didn't.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Tell me about yours.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Her name was Betty.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	And do you miss her?
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- No, of course not.
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- Is it Betty you see?
__VOICEOVER	No, no, I haven't seen her
__VOICEOVER	or thought about Betty in years.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	And how does it feel
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	to be talking about her now?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	It feels rather wonderful,
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	actually.
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- Hah.
SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	- You see,
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	now we're getting somewhere.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO PERSON)	No, thank you,
(CONT'D)	I know, bit of an odd request
(CONT'D)	but you've been very helpful.
(CONT'D)	Who knew the art of perfumery
(CONT'D)	was so involved?
(CONT'D)	Yes, thank you again, goodbye.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	Hello, again.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	- Ms. Willoughby.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	- Don't mind, do you?
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'm sorry,
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	this really is too much.
(CONT'D)	I come in here for
(CONT'D)	my daily dose of me time.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	Uh, yes. You seem to be
(CONT'D)	somewhat of a regular
(CONT'D)	at the bookshop.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I suppose I am,
(CONT'D)	and of course,
(CONT'D)	the book club meets there.
(CONT'D)	It's one of Helen's
(CONT'D)	attempts to stay afloat,
(CONT'D)	sort of a mixed bunch.
(CONT'D)	Rather too
(CONT'D)	much alcohol is involved,
__VOICEOVER	but it does one good
__VOICEOVER	to flex one's critical muscles.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	Yes, I'm sure.
(CONT'D)	Um, considering what
(CONT'D)	happened yesterday,
(CONT'D)	have you seen anything unusual
(CONT'D)	or different recently?
(CONT'D)	In York?
(CONT'D)	Or in the bookshop?
(CONT'D)	No.
(CONT'D)	It's as dead as it always is,
(CONT'D)	like God.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	It was just a thought.
__VOICEOVER	- Of course,
(CONT'D)	Helen isn't without some stress
(CONT'D)	in her life
(CONT'D)	on top of the book shop.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	I'm sorry?
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	There's talk that she's
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	being pressured into
(CONT'D)	selling their house.
(CONT'D)	It's her family's, you know?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	Yes, it's
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	been there for generations.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Well, I wouldn't know about that
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	but I'd heard, God knows where,
__VOICEOVER	is offering her silly money.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	You don't happen to know
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	the name of this developer?
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Ch--
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Charles Vaines.
(CONT'D)	Sorry,
(CONT'D)	I couldn't help myself.
(CONT'D)	Diana Branson.
(CONT'D)	No relation,
(CONT'D)	and I know who you are.
(CONT'D)	Has Sarah been telling you
(CONT'D)	Oh, you should ask
(CONT'D)	Elizabeth to read it.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	I'm sorry.
(CONT'D)	Charles Vaines has been
(CONT'D)	putting pressure on Helen?
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, he's been
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	hounding her for months.
(CONT'D)	Very stressful for her.
(CONT'D)	I'm sure
(CONT'D)	it's not helping anything.
(CONT'D)	In fact, everything could
(CONT'D)	be his fault, don't you think?
(CONT'D)	Should we blame him?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	I mean, knowing Charles Vaines,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	I wouldn't be at all surprised.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Poor Helen.
(CONT'D)	She's such a free spirit.
(CONT'D)	Such an old and wise soul.
(CONT'D)	The Charles Vaines of this life
(CONT'D)	must be something of
(CONT'D)	a shock for her.
(CONT'D)	It's no wonder she's
(CONT'D)	falling apart, really, is it?

(CONT'D)	of course
(CONT'D)	I'm still angry at you.
CHARLES TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Well, at least we can pretend to be civil.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO CHARLES)	Why are you pressuring
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO CHARLES)	Helen Deakin
(CONT'D)	to sell her father's estate?
(CONT'D)	It's been in her family
(CONT'D)	for generations.
CHARLES TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Not everyone can afford
CHARLES TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	the luxury of sentimentality
(CONT'D)	when it comes to paying the bills.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO CHARLES)	What are your plans for it?
CHARLES TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Green Acres Golf Course and Spa.
THE CHARLES TO MISS WILLOUGHB	- Another spa?
THE CHARLES TO MISS WILLOUGHB	- That house
(CONT'D)	is falling apart
(CONT'D)	around their ears,
(CONT'D)	coupled with that hemorrhaging
(CONT'D)	albatross of a business.
(CONT'D)	They'll soon be begging me
(CONT'D)	to take it off their hands.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO CHARLES)	Helen Deakin
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO CHARLES)	does not want your money
(CONT'D)	and no amount of bullying
(CONT'D)	is going to make her
(CONT'D)	change her mind.
CHARLES TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Bravo.
CHARLES TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Fabulous.
(CONT'D)	You quite made my day,
(CONT'D)	but I will get my hands
(CONT'D)	on that property,
(CONT'D)	histrionics or no histrionics.
(CONT'D)	I'll send you
(CONT'D)	a voucher for a facial.
(CONT'D)	You can bring a friend.

ROBERT)	- Vernon.
ROBERT)	- Robert, you made it in time.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- I take it everybody's met?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Yes.
ROBERT TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)	What is that?
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ROBERT)	It's an Electromagnetic Field Meter.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ROBERT)	It detects objects
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ROBERT)	that move with electricity.
OLIVER TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)	Wait, do ghosts move
OLIVER TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)	with electricity?
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO OLIVER)	Well, by way
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO OLIVER)	of electrical field, yes.
(CONT'D)	Possibly.
(CONT'D)	It all comes under the banner
__VOICEOVER	of Morphic resonance.
(CONT'D)	It's a fascinating hypothesis
(CONT'D)	if you've got a minute.
MURRAY)	Uh, not now, Vernon.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ALL)	Well, ah, so, I shall use
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ALL)	the recording equipment
(CONT'D)	to capture any
(CONT'D)	electronic voice phenomena.
THEN PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ALL)	- Of course you will.
THEN PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ALL)	- Well, I think that's it.
(CONT'D)	I think we're all set,
(CONT'D)	and we'll start where
(CONT'D)	you first sensed something.
(CONT'D)	If you wouldn't mind observing
(CONT'D)	from there, thank you.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	So, how was the charming Gaya?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, absolutely delightful,
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	we had a wonderful time.
(CONT'D)	Yes, she is still crippled
(CONT'D)	by your treachery
(CONT'D)	and your betrayal
(CONT'D)	of the sisterhood,
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	but she's not going
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	to let that stand in her way.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	What did she say
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	about the medication?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	She did mention
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	post-traumatic psychosis.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- I think that's a non-starter.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Yeah.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You shouldn't really
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	be encouraging this, Lizzie.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I completely agree.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Oh come on, aren't you
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	just a little bit intrigued?
HELEN TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)	I think it was round about here.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	I hear Charles Vaines
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	has been snooping around.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Hm. Helen won't sell.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I pleaded with her,
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	but she just won't.
OLIVER TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)	Sorry.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO HELEN)	Please?
HELEN TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)	I don't want to go on.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO HELEN)	Just a little bit farther, please.
(CONT'D)	Alright, you can return.
MURRAY)	- Did you get anything?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Bit of a washout, I'd say.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Shh.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ALL)	Let's see what we've got.
HELEN TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)(VO	I don't want to go on.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO HELEN)(VO	Just a little bit farther, please.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ALL)	There!
MURRAY)	No, I, I didn't hear anything.
WILLOUGHBY)	Listen, listen.
HELEN TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)(VO	I don't want to go on.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO HELEN)(VO	Just a little bit farther, please.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO ALL)	There!
HELEN TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)	I can hear what it's saying.
MURRAY)	- Do you know that voice?
MURRAY)	- It's him.
(CONT'D)	It's my father.
(CONT'D)	I know what he's saying.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL)	"Bella."
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ALL) (CONT'D	He's saying "Oh, Bella."
RONALD TO HELEN)(VO)	Oh, Bella.
WILLOUGHBY)	I'm really, really excited.
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	This is an incredibly
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	strong response!
TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Yes, thank you, Vernon.
TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- When do you think
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	I could come again?
WILLOUGHBY) (CONT'D)	I'd like to bring a colleague.
MURRAY)	Um, I, I don't know.
MURRAY)	I'll see you later, thank you.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- I, I think we should go, Robert.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Right.
ROBERT TO HELEN)	Get a good,
ROBERT TO HELEN)	stiff drink down you.
__VOICEOVER	- There's the book club
HELEN TO ROBERT (CONT'D)	this evening,
HELEN TO ROBERT (CONT'D)	I can't let them down.
HELEN TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	To be among friends
HELEN TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	will do me good.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	I'll, um,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Yes, thank you, Lizzie…
(CONT'D)	I think.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Do you think that was a mistake?
(CONT'D)	Helen wouldn't even look at me,
(CONT'D)	did you see that?
(CONT'D)	You felt something, didn't you?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Not sure what I felt.
(CONT'D)	It was pure theater,
(CONT'D)	Lizzie, nothing more.
(CONT'D)	If I felt anything,
(CONT'D)	it was because
(CONT'D)	I was being manipulated
(CONT'D)	by Murray
(CONT'D)	by tapping into
(CONT'D)	and exploiting some…
(CONT'D)	latent fear
(CONT'D)	that we all share.
(CONT'D)	Are you listening to me, Lizzie?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Oh, I'm sorry.
__VOICEOVER	Uh, why don't you take
__VOICEOVER	the car and go home?
(CONT'D)	I need to clear my head.
(CONT'D)	I'll call Andrew later
(CONT'D)	and he can come get me.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Alright, Lizzie.
(CONT'D)	Take your time.
OLIVER TO HELEN)	Who the hell is Bella?
HELEN TO OLIVER)	That's me, Oliver.
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	For God's sake, that was
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Daddy's name for me, I'm Bella.
OLIVER TO HELEN)	How was I supposed to know that?
HELEN TO OLIVER)	Oh, it doesn't matter.
OLIVER TO HELEN)	Helen.
OLIVER TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Helen, you're not going ahead
OLIVER TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	with this evening. Why not?
HELEN TO OLIVER)	It's not as if my dead father's
HELEN TO OLIVER)	trying to make contact with me.
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	It's not as if
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	I'm losing my mind, like,
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	unraveling or falling apart
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	or losing my grip or anything.
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	So why not?
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	May as well carry on
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	as if nothing's wrong
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	and your wife isn't a lunatic
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	with unresolved daddy issues,
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	because, admit it,
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	it's what you are really thinking.
TITLE)	minster
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- "Hotel by the Shore."
(CONT'D)	Diana's choice.
(CONT'D)	Such a very slim volume,
(CONT'D)	not really to my liking.
(CONT'D)	I find extra-marital
(CONT'D)	relationships rather dispirited.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	I thought it was more
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	to do with the loneliness
(CONT'D)	and futility of being
(CONT'D)	a middle-aged woman.
(CONT'D)	Why the change in venue?
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh, isn't it marvelous?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	And what about Helen?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	She's over there right now,
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- setting up.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- No.
(CONT'D) THEN SARAH TO DIANA)	- No. She knew.
(CONT'D) THEN SARAH TO DIANA)	- I thought you'd told her, Diana.
DIANA)	- What?
DIANA)	- Well, I thought
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	you'd spoken to her,
SARAH TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	it was your idea after all.
__VOICEOVER	Oh God, I am so sorry.
DIANA TO SARAH) (CONT'D)	It completely slipped my mind.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	So you just thought
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	you'd hijack
(CONT'D)	her book club
(CONT'D)	without telling her?
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Hardly hijacking.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Slight overdramatisation.
(CONT'D) THEN SARAH TO DIANA)	- We just thought--
(CONT'D) THEN SARAH TO DIANA)	- You thought.
DIANA TO SARAH)	I thought…
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	that with everything
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	that's going on,
(CONT'D)	this was just the last thing
(CONT'D)	that Helen needed.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	She's not well.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	We worry about her.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I worry about her safety.
(CONT'D)	I worry about Oliver
(CONT'D)	and his safety too,
(CONT'D)	but you know what she is like,
(CONT'D)	Elizabeth.
(CONT'D)	She wouldn't dream
(CONT'D)	of letting us down.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	It's just a shame
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	you didn't bother to tell her.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	It was a genuine mistake.
(CONT'D)	I really don't know why
(CONT'D)	you're making such a fuss.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	You've got something
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	green stuck in your teeth.
SARAH TO DIANA)	Yeah, it is right there,
SARAH TO DIANA)	love, yeah.
__VOICEOVER	You've got something.
ANDREW TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Goodnight,
ANDREW TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Ms. Willoughby.
ROBERT TO ANDREW)	Thank you, Andrew.
ROBERT TO ANDREW)	Goodnight.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Not for me,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	thank you.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You're letting all this
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	mumbo jumbo get to you.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	You're probably right.
(CONT'D)	Eh, but listen to this
(CONT'D)	and tell me you can't hear it.
HELEN TO PROFESSOR MURRAY)(VO	I don't want to go on.
PROFESSOR MURRAY TO HELEN)(VO	Just a little bit farther, please.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	What do you want to achieve?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I want to hear it again.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	It was so clear in the shop.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You heard
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	what you wanted to hear.
(CONT'D)	So did Helen.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	That's the point.
(CONT'D)	I don't want to hear it.
(CONT'D)	I don't want it to be true.
(CONT'D)	I don't want it to be
(CONT'D)	the ghost of Helen's father.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I don't understand.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Because…
(CONT'D)	because if it is…
(CONT'D)	then…
(CONT'D)	then why haven't Mummy
(CONT'D)	and Daddy ever come to see me?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Lizzie.
(CONT'D)	There's nothing here.
(CONT'D)	What you thought you heard,
(CONT'D)	what we all felt,
(CONT'D)	it's just a flimflam.
(CONT'D)	Pepper's ghost,
(CONT'D)	with Murray as the Wizard of Oz,
(CONT'D)	pulling his levers
(CONT'D)	and fiddling with his dials.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Can you be absolutely certain?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	The only think I can
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	be absolutely certain of
(CONT'D)	is that Helen is a wonderful,
(CONT'D)	lovely woman, who is…
(CONT'D)	not well.
(CONT'D)	The kindest thing to do
(CONT'D)	is take a step back
(CONT'D)	and let Oliver get her
(CONT'D)	the help she needs.
(CONT'D)	I'll see you in the morning.
(CONT'D)	Lizzie.
(CONT'D)	You parents loved you.
(CONT'D)	They loved you very, very much.
HELEN TO OLIVER)	Oliver?
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Oliver?
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Oliver?
OLIVER)	- Helen?
OLIVER)	-Did you hear the piano?
__VOICEOVER	Just now?
OLIVER TO HELEN)	I'm just grabbing
OLIVER TO HELEN)	a glass of water.
HELEN)	- He's here!
HELEN TO OLIVER)	My father! He's here.
HELEN TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Do you hear that?
OLIVER)	- What?
OLIVER)	- The piano!
OLIVER TO HELEN)	I can't hear it.
OLIVER TO HELEN)	Anything, I can't hear it.
HELEN TO OLIVER)	- For God's sake!
HELEN TO OLIVER)	- Please, let me go!
OLIVER TO HELEN)	No! There's no one here,
OLIVER TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Helen, I promise you!
OLIVER TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	There's nothing to be afraid of.
HELEN)	- Let me go, Oliver! Let me go!
HELEN)	- Listen to me!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Hello?
HELEN TO OLIVER)	- Helen?
HELEN TO OLIVER)	- He's here!
OLIVER TO HELEN)(VO)	Will you listen?!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Helen!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	- Helen!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	- Oliver!
OLIVER)	Somebody pick up the phone!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ANDREW)	Andrew,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ANDREW)	I'm sorry to wake you
(CONT'D)	but I need the car brought
(CONT'D)	'round immediately.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)(VO)	Are you sure about this, Lizzie?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- You didn't hear them.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- I don't think turning up
TO ROBERT)	- half-handed is the answer.
TO ROBERT)	- She said her father was there.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Sounds like she's hysterical.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- She wasn't.
(CONT'D)	It was just when Oliver
(CONT'D)	got the phone it all kicked off.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Do you think I should drive?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Do you want to drive?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Yes!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Don't be ridiculous,
(CONT'D)	I've got my advanced driver's
(CONT'D)	certificate, get in the car.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Lizzie!
(CONT'D)	He's still breathing.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Oliver. Oliver!
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	It was like this
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	when you arrived?
TO D.I. PRYCE)	- Lizzie?
TO D.I. PRYCE)	- What? Sorry!
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	The front door was open
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	and Mr. Deakin unconscious…
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE)	I found him there, yes.
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	And you heard Mrs. Deakin
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	attack her husband?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	Well, I don't know what I heard.
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Mr. Deakin said it was his wife.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	She's been under an awful lot
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	of stress recently.
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	And there's no sign of her.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	No. Both cards are still here
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	so she's on foot.
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I hate to say it,
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Elizabeth,
(CONT'D)	but you are a trouble magnet,
(CONT'D)	aren't you?
__VOICEOVER	That is exactly what
__VOICEOVER	I keep telling her, Jimmy.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	What did I do?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	She probably ran into the woods.
PRYCE)	- And what makes you think that?
PRYCE)	- Well, there's only
(CONT'D)	one track out of here
(CONT'D)	and none of us saw her,
(CONT'D)	and Helen knows these woods
(CONT'D)	like the back of her hand.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oliver said she's wearing
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	a blue tartan dressing gown
(CONT'D)	with slippers.
(CONT'D)	It's a full moon,
(CONT'D)	should make it
(CONT'D)	easier to find her.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Okay, well you stay here
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	in case she doubles back.
__VOICEOVER	- I'll go with Jimmy.
__VOICEOVER	- Ah, you and I are going nowhere.
(CONT'D)	It's the middle of the night
(CONT'D)	and I've only got
PRYCE)	- one other officer with me.
PRYCE)	- Well, what time
WILLOUGHBY)	- does backup arrive?
WILLOUGHBY)	- God knows.
WILLOUGHBY)	- That's not good enough, is it?
WILLOUGHBY)	- It's protocol, Elizabeth.
WILLOUGHBY)	- Helen is out there alone.
WILLOUGHBY)	- And we'll find her,
(CONT'D)	but we've got to do
(CONT'D)	everything by the book.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	You're going to let
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	a defenseless member
(CONT'D)	of the public, a woman,
(CONT'D)	and a taxpayer, I might add,
(CONT'D)	go out there,
(CONT'D)	into the impenetrable forest,
(CONT'D)	alone,
(CONT'D)	in the middle of the night,
(CONT'D)	with just a torch
(CONT'D)	to protect herself?
(CONT'D)	Or are you going to start
(CONT'D)	acting like a detective?
D.I. PRYCE TO ROBERT)	Stay with Deakin, will you?
D.I. PRYCE TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Elizabeth's right.
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE)	She usually is!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Helen! Where are you?
D.I. PRYCE TO HELEN)	Mrs. Deakin!
__VOICEOVER	Helen!
D.I. PRYCE TO HELEN)	Helen!
D.I. PRYCE TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Mrs. Deakin!
D.I. PRYCE TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Mrs. Deakin!
D.I. PRYCE TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Helen?
D.I. PRYCE TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Helen Deakin!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Helen!
(CONT'D)	Helen!
D.I. PRYCE TO HELEN)	Mrs. Deakin!
D.I. PRYCE TO HELEN) (CONT'D)	Mrs. Deakin!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	Jimmy! Jimmy, I found something!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Helen!
(CONT'D)	Helen.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	Have you done this before, Jimmy?
(CONT'D)	Do you think she's down there?
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'll keep you posted.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Any luck?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Where's Oliver?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	They took him in the ambulance?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	No, it was just a superficial wound.
(CONT'D)	He's asleep upstairs.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	You were right.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	About what?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Helen.
(CONT'D)	I should have listened to you.
(CONT'D)	She's very ill and I didn't see it
(CONT'D)	because I didn't want to.
(CONT'D)	I can solve a mystery
(CONT'D)	but I can't solve somebody being sick.
(CONT'D)	This is all my fault, Robert,
(CONT'D)	me and my ego…
(CONT'D)	thinking I know better
(CONT'D)	than everybody else,
(CONT'D)	when all I've done
(CONT'D)	is make it worse.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Lizzie.
(CONT'D)	Don't do this.
(CONT'D)	You were just trying to help.
(CONT'D)	It's what you always do.
(CONT'D)	You can't win every battle.
(CONT'D)	How many times
(CONT'D)	have I told you that?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Too many.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'll go up and check on Oliver.
MAN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Ma'am.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Lizzie.
(CONT'D)	He's out like a light.
(CONT'D)	You look like you
(CONT'D)	could use some rest.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I'm fine, honestly.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'm not taking no for an answer.
(CONT'D)	Come on. You can curl up
(CONT'D)	in one of their spare bedrooms.
(CONT'D)	I will wake you
(CONT'D)	if there's any news.
OLIVER TO MAN)	I know.
OLIVER TO SPEAKER) (CONT'D)	I know, yes.
OLIVER TO SPEAKER) (CONT'D)	They're searching the lake.
OLIVER TO SPEAKER) (CONT'D)	I know, you were right.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	- Lizzie.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	- Sorry. I'm just gonna…
WILLOUGHBY)	put my head down for a minute.
WILLOUGHBY)	Yes, yes, of course,
(CONT'D)	of course.
OLIVER TO SPEAKER)(VO) [VO])	"They're searching the lake.
[VO])	You were right."
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Lizzie, wake up.
(CONT'D)	They found something.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I can't do this, Lizzie.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	It's okay. You stay with Robert.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	Do you think it's her?
D.I. PRYCE TO LIZZE)	We don't know.
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Are you sure you want
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	to do this?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	Hm.
D.I. PRYCE TO OFFICER)	Call the coroner, please.
D.I. PRYCE TO OFFICER) (CONT'D)	Tell her it's not Helen Deakin.
__VOICEOVER	Tell her we've got another
__VOICEOVER	corpse on our hand,
D.I. PRYCE TO OFFICER) (CONT'D)	looks like
D.I. PRYCE TO OFFICER) (CONT'D)	he's been down there a while.
WILLOUGHBY)	- What now?
WILLOUGHBY)	- We keep looking.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	What are the odds of you
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	finding another body down there?
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Extraordinary.
(CONT'D)	Bodies aren't like London buses,
(CONT'D)	they don't come all at once.
OFFICER TO D.I. PRYCE)	The coroner would like a word.
__VOICEOVER	Excuse me.
OLIVER TO GROUP)	I can't believe it.
OLIVER TO GROUP)	I convinced myself it was her.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	No, it's, it's been
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	down there a few years,
(CONT'D)	by the looks of things.
ROBERT TO GROUP)	Well, then this is good news.
OLIVER TO GROUP)	Yes, yes I know. Um…
OLIVER TO GROUP) (CONT'D)	I'm going back to the house,
OLIVER TO GROUP)	I can't go through that again.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Well, we'll come with you.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- No, no, it's alright.
(CONT'D)	I'd rather be on my own, please.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Just leave me alone.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Very.
(CONT'D)	That was Oliver!
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Where is he going
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	in such a hurry?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I don't know,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	but I'm going to find out.
(CONT'D)	You stay here
(CONT'D)	and wait for Pryce.
__VOICEOVER	
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Willoughby.
(CONT'D)	You caught me,
(CONT'D)	got me bang for rights.
(CONT'D)	I'll come peacefully,
(CONT'D)	officer, no need to cuff me.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Oliver, what are you doing?
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- I, actually…
__VOICEOVER	you'll laugh, because I know…
(CONT'D)	this sounds strange, but I…
(CONT'D)	I booked Helen a spa day for
(CONT'D)	when she returns because that,
(CONT'D)	that's what she's going to do,
(CONT'D)	isn't it?
(CONT'D)	She's going to,
(CONT'D)	she's going to come back.
(CONT'D)	I realized that when
(CONT'D)	she wasn't in the lake,
(CONT'D)	that she's going to come back,
(CONT'D)	and when she does,
(CONT'D)	she'll have a spa day.
(CONT'D)	For our wedding anniversary.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	Oh, I see.
(CONT'D)	When is that?
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Next month. Why?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	Oh. August wedding, how lovely.
(CONT'D)	Oliver I,
(CONT'D)	I think you should go home.
(CONT'D)	Have something to eat,
(CONT'D)	take a shower,
(CONT'D)	wait for D.I. Pryce to update you.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You're right,
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	of course you're right.
(CONT'D)	I'm not thinking straight, am I?
(CONT'D)	I'll go home now.
(CONT'D)	Look at me going home.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	Diana Branson.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	- What about her?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	- Who is she?
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'd heard you were
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	the amateur sleuth.
(CONT'D)	I'd have thought that
(CONT'D)	was basic research.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	But you know everything.
(CONT'D)	Humor me, and I'll read your book.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Born and raised in London,
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	then Oxford,
(CONT'D)	a degree in in something
(CONT'D)	pharmacological.
(CONT'D)	Oxford's also where
(CONT'D)	she met her first husband.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Her first?
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- There have been four.
(CONT'D)	First one died, choked on
(CONT'D)	a salt and vinegar crisp.
(CONT'D)	Second one divorced,
TO SARAH)	- third one disappeared.
TO SARAH)	- And the fourth?
__VOICEOVER	He was some financial hotshot.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- Was?
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	- He died…
(CONT'D)	about a year ago, in prison,
(CONT'D)	having been convicted of fraud.
(CONT'D)	Diana was also tried
(CONT'D)	but got off.
(CONT'D)	She lost all her money.
(CONT'D)	How she pays for that house
(CONT'D)	is anyone's guess.
(CONT'D)	As for that ridiculous
(CONT'D)	business of hers--
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	Thank you.
(CONT'D)	Wait, where do I send my book?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Lizzie, call me back, please.
(CONT'D)	Oliver's back,
(CONT'D)	he is acting oddly.
__VOICEOVER	Elizabeth, what a surprise.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SPEAKER)	May I come in?
SPEAKER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Yes, of course you can.
(CONT'D)	Do you want tea?
(CONT'D)	I was just steeping some matcha.
(CONT'D)	What do you say?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SPEAKER)	Uh, no thank you, I'm a
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SPEAKER)	English Breakfast kind of girl.
WILLOUGHBY)	- So you know Charles Vaines?
WILLOUGHBY)	- Mm-hm.
(CONT'D)	Charles and I go back years.
(CONT'D)	This house was one of his
(CONT'D)	more recent developments.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SPEAKER)	You visited him on
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SPEAKER)	the same day that I did.
(CONT'D)	Was it to warm him?
SPEAKER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Have you been following me?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SPEAKER)	You left a rather
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SPEAKER)	juicy calling card.
__VOICEOVER	House like this can't come cheap.
SPEAKER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You have been doing
SPEAKER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	your homework.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Subject: The Lifetime
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	and Finances of Diana Branson.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	Oh not really,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	I just had tea with Sarah.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh.
(CONT'D)	Dear Sarah,
(CONT'D)	the eyes and ears of the world.
(CONT'D)	Why are you here?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	Helen's missing.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Oh.
(CONT'D)	That's dreadful.
(CONT'D)	Um…
(CONT'D)	how's Oliver coping?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	He's devastated, obviously.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Yes, I can imagine.
(CONT'D)	What have the police said?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	Nothing.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	They haven't found anything?
(CONT'D)	Huh,
(CONT'D)	no clues as to
(CONT'D)	her whereabouts,
(CONT'D)	isn't that what they say?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	The investigation is ongoing.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	What about me?
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	The word around town is
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	you're quite the detective.
(CONT'D)	Since the police
(CONT'D)	are getting nowhere,
(CONT'D)	I wondered
(CONT'D)	if you had the answer.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	Just another question.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Which is?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	How long have you
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	an Oliver been having an affair?
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	It's a long story.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I've got plenty of time.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Why don't you let me
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	go put the kettle on?
(CONT'D)	You're sure I can't tempt you?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	No. Thank you.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I don't know about you,
(CONT'D)	but I quite fancy a drive.
(CONT'D)	What do you think?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	You were in the house
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	when Helen disappeared.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Stop talking.
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I've done this before, you know?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	The third husband?
(CONT'D)	Where is Helen, is she alive?
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	"Where is Helen?
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Is she alive?"
(CONT'D)	Yes, of course she's alive.
(CONT'D)	Come on.
(CONT'D)	Pretend I'm your best friend.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	Where are we going?
DIANA TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Get in.
(CONT'D)	Get out. Come on.
(CONT'D)	You won't need that.
(CONT'D)	Walk, walk, walk.
(CONT'D)	Here, take these keys.
(CONT'D)	The big one.
(CONT'D)	Inside.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Helen!
__VOICEOVER	Get back.
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE)	How long until they've finished?
D.I. PRYCE TO ROBERT)	24 hours at a guess, 36 tops.
D.I. PRYCE TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	After that,
D.I. PRYCE TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	we'll focus on the moors.
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE)	Hm.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	If that's Willoughby,
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	tell her to call me back.
OLIVER TO DIANA)	What is it?
__VOICEOVER	- What?
DIANA TO OLIVER)	She turned up at the house.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	My house!
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	She knows about everything.
OLIVER TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	Sweetheart, sweetheart,
OLIVER TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	I can't just leave.
OLIVER TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	My wife's supposed
OLIVER TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	to be missing, remember?
DIANA TO OLIVER)	This is your mess.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Come and clean it up.
OLIVER TO DIANA)	I can't, not right now!
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Everything alright?
__VOICEOVER	Yes.
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Absolutely.
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	That was Helen's psychiatrist.
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	I have to go into town.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Now?
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	Yes.
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Uh, I want to pick up
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Helen's prescription.
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	She'll need it when she,
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	uh, comes back.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Why didn't you pick it up
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	earlier when you were in town?
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	Different direction.
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	I, uh, went to fill the car up.
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	I have to do something, Robert,
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	I can't bear all this waiting.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	I completely understand.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Listen, mind if I catch a ride with you?
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	Hm.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Great.
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Willoughby's
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	left me high and dry, you know?
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Hey, thanks for this.
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Thought you could use
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	some company, anyhow.
OLIVER TO ROBERT)	Um, actually, actually, uh…
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	no.
OLIVER TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	No, I prefer to be by myself.
ROBERT TO OLIVER)	Well, uh, if you're sure.
ROBERT TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Drive safe!
ROBERT TO OFFICER)	I need to speak to D.I. Pryce,
ROBERT TO OFFICER) (CONT'D)	and I need somebody
ROBERT TO OFFICER) (CONT'D)	to give me ride
ROBERT TO OFFICER) (CONT'D)	back to Willoughby House. Now!
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE)	Here it is.
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE) (CONT'D)	Success!
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE) (CONT'D)	Pryce, I have him.
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE) [VO])	The Howardian Hills.
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE) [VO])	He's a long way from home.
D.I. PRYCE TO ROBERT [VO])	Okay, Robert, direct me.
OLIVE TO DIANA)	What a mess.
DIANA TO OLIVER)	You weren't followed?
OLIVE TO DIANA)	No!
OLIVE TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	They were all
OLIVE TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	too busy at the lake.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Oh…
(CONT'D)	oh, Helen!
DIANA TO OLIVER)	Sweetheart.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	I know it's difficult,
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	but you did agree
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	it was the only way.
OLIVER TO DIANA)	I know.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	- What am I going to do?!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	- Try and stay calm, okay?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	- She's going to kill us.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	- Okay, take a deep breath.
OLIVER TO DIANA)	- Just be calm.
OLIVER TO DIANA)	- Are you sure
OLIVER TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	I can't just talk to her?
OLIVER TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	Get a divorce.
OLIVER TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	Like normal people.
DIANA TO OLIVER)	And live off
DIANA TO OLIVER)	what the bookshop makes?
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	I don't think so.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	We need the house.
OLIVER TO DIANA)	But it's her family home.
DIANA TO OLIVER)	Do you want to spend the rest
DIANA TO OLIVER)	of your life with me or not?
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Notice you have
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	to think about it…
OLIVER TO DIANA)	No! No, of course I,
OLIVER TO DIANA)	of course I do.
__VOICEOVER	Of course, I just…
OLIVER TO DIANA) (CONT'D)	but there are two of them now.
DIANA TO OLIVER)	You got Willoughby involved,
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	you can sort her out.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Key, gun,
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	bang bang.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	That's it.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Do it for me, sweetheart.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Do it for us.
DIANA TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	This way.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Okay, shh.
(CONT'D)	Stay here, just stay here.
(CONT'D)	Shh.
OLIVER TO HELEN)	I'm sorry.
HELEN TO OLIVER)	Oh.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Helen!
(CONT'D)	Helen!
DIANA TO OLIVER)	You're utterly pathetic.
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE)	Keep going,
ROBERT TO D.I. PRYCE)	it should be the next right.
D.I. PRYCE TO OLIVER)	Where are they?
D.I. PRYCE TO OLIVER) (CONT'D)	Where's Willoughby?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Hey, hey.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Quick, quick, this way.
(CONT'D)	Quick!
D.I. PRYCE TO OFFICER)	Cuff him!
D.I. PRYCE TO OFFICER)	I need armed response.
D.I. PRYCE TO OFFICER) (CONT'D)	We've got gunfire
D.I. PRYCE TO OFFICER) (CONT'D)	at the Howardian Hills.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Shh, stay here.
__VOICEOVER	
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	Phew.
D.I. PRYCE TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Elizabeth!
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO D.I. PRYCE)	Jimmy! Just in time.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Thank you, Willow.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	I think I broke her nose.
HELEN TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Good.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	So, a love-struck husband,
(CONT'D)	a bankrupt mistress,
(CONT'D)	an estate worth of fortune,
(CONT'D)	why didn't Oliver
(CONT'D)	just ask for a divorce?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Well, because a divorce
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	would mean sharing
(CONT'D)	and Diana's
(CONT'D)	not the sharing type.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	So…
(CONT'D)	the two of them set about
(CONT'D)	to drive dear Helen mad.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Well, they set about
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	making her think she was mad.
(CONT'D)	It's classic gas-lighting.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You know, sometimes
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I fail to see how you do it.
(CONT'D)	You and I have exactly
(CONT'D)	the same information and yet,
(CONT'D)	to me, it's still a mystery.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Well, our brains work
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	in different ways.
(CONT'D)	Once I realized that Oliver was
(CONT'D)	having an affair with Diana,
(CONT'D)	I mean, everything
(CONT'D)	fell into place,
(CONT'D)	and then he confirmed it
(CONT'D)	with that silly little lie
(CONT'D)	about the date
(CONT'D)	of his wedding anniversary.
OLIVER TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	She'll have a spa day.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	- For our wedding anniversary.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	- When is that?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	- Next month. Why?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO OLIVER)	- Oh. August wedding.
(CONT'D)	How lovely.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I'm afraid I really don't
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	understand what you are saying.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I suspect that Oliver
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	ran to Diana in a panic
(CONT'D)	after that other body
(CONT'D)	was found,
(CONT'D)	which, by the way,
(CONT'D)	I think we'll find
(CONT'D)	was Diana's third husband,
(CONT'D)	the one that disappeared?
(CONT'D)	Classic Black Widow.
(CONT'D) [VO])	And then there's
(CONT'D) [VO])	the connection to Vaines,
__VOICEOVER	this was all about.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	You left a rather
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DIANA)	juicy calling card.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	The house and the estate,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	I mean God knows
(CONT'D)	what would have happened
(CONT'D)	to Oliver eventually?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	The abduction?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Well, Diana was in
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	the house that night.
(CONT'D) [VO])	She had a recording
(CONT'D) [VO])	of the piano music and…
(CONT'D) [VO])	her car was parked outside
(CONT'D) [VO])	while it was raining,
(CONT'D) [VO])	hence the dry patch
(CONT'D) [VO])	on the driveway.
(CONT'D)	She drove off with Helen,
(CONT'D)	probably drugged and…
(CONT'D)	Oliver hit himself
(CONT'D)	over the head with a plant pot.
(CONT'D)	That's why the wound
(CONT'D)	was so superficial.
__VOICEOVER	was in the house?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Her OCD.
(CONT'D) [VO])	She has this thing
(CONT'D) [VO])	about straight lines.
(CONT'D) [VO])	It was all in the pencils.
(CONT'D) [VO])	She couldn't resist.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- What about Ronald's ghost?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	- Well…
__VOICEOVER	when you mentioned Pepper's ghost.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Mm?
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	It's easy to make
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	a few bookcases wobble,
(CONT'D)	I mean they're movable,
(CONT'D)	and they had been moved recently,
(CONT'D) [VO])	'cause I saw fresh drag marks
(CONT'D) [VO])	on the bookshop floor.
(CONT'D) [VO])	Books fly off the shelves
(CONT'D) [VO])	with a push, that's easy.
(CONT'D)	They put the idea
(CONT'D)	of the ghost in Helen's head,
(CONT'D)	and that's what she saw
(CONT'D)	with the aid
(CONT'D)	of Diana's
(CONT'D)	pharmaceutical knowledge.
(CONT'D) [VO])	I'm willing to guess
(CONT'D) [VO])	her beta blockers were anything but,
(CONT'D)	swapped out for something
(CONT'D)	more prone to hallucinations.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	I am supposing
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	they must have sourced
(CONT'D)	Ronald's cologne from somewhere.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Yes, the cologne.
(CONT'D)	It's the only thing
(CONT'D)	that's niggling.
(CONT'D)	I checked
(CONT'D)	with the perfumery in town,
(CONT'D)	Ronald's cologne
(CONT'D)	was an artisanal creation
(CONT'D)	that was made before certain
(CONT'D)	ingredients were banned,
(CONT'D)	uh, synthetic musk
(CONT'D)	in particular.
(CONT'D)	There's just no way that anyone
(CONT'D)	could recreate that scent now.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	So, it was all in her head then?
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	You know,
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	you have a brilliant mind.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Thank you, Robert.
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Hah.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Oh, you monster!
ROBERT TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Goodnight, my dear.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO ROBERT)	Goodnight, Robert.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DR. SHIRANI)	Gaya!
(CONT'D)	I'd forgotten
(CONT'D)	you were Helen's doctor.
WILLOUGHBY)	- How is she?
WILLOUGHBY)	- She'll be fine.
(CONT'D)	She's still affected
(CONT'D)	by the medication but
(CONT'D)	it'll take time
(CONT'D)	to get out of her system.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DR. SHIRANI)	Good. Well, it's…
(CONT'D)	nice to see you
(CONT'D)	after all these years.
(CONT'D)	No hard feelings, I hope?
DR. SHIRANI TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Of course there are.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO DR. SHIRANI)	Oh.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	Mr. Thompson?
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	How are you feeling?
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI)	Wonderful.
ROBERT TO DR. SHIRANI) (CONT'D)	I feel wonderful.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT)	That's marvelous.
DR. SHIRANI TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	Do send my regards to Dr. Foster.
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	Ms. Willoughby,
SARAH TO MISS WILLOUGHBY)	how lovely to see you!
(CONT'D)	Come in, come in.
(CONT'D)	I, uh, I couldn't leave
(CONT'D)	She's been through so much.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO SARAH)	That's very nice of you.
SARAH)	- Can I take those?
SARAH)	- Of course.
SARAH TO ROBERT)	And who's this?
ROBERT TO SARAH)	Um, uh, Robert,
ROBERT TO SARAH)	an old friend.
SARAH TO ROBERT)	And American?
SARAH TO ROBERT)	How romantic.
SARAH TO ROBERT)	- I'll just, I'll just go.
SARAH TO ROBERT)	- I made some tea.
SARAH TO ROBERT) (CONT'D)	And there's cake.
ROBERT TO SARAH)	Ooh.
RONALD TO HELEN)	Oh, Bella.
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	Oh Helen,
MISS WILLOUGHBY TO HELEN)	this will make you laugh.
