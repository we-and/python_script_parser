THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But just how closely are you watching? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	There are lots of cranes on Sodor. They are all different sizes and do all sorts of different jobs.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Kevin helps Victor at the Steamworks. Well, most of the time! (chuckle.)

THE EARL OF SODOR	Rocky is part of the Search and Rescue team. He lifts de-railed engines back onto the tracks.

THE EARL OF SODOR	...And Cranky lifts cargo on and off of the ships at Brendam Docks.

THE EARL OF SODOR	But which of these cranes is the tallest? Is it Kevin? Is it Rocky? Or is it Cranky?

THE EARL OF SODOR	It's Cranky! Cranky is a very tall crane. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	He needs to be tall, so he can lift up cargo from the dockside onto the waiting ships.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray! That was fun! Let's play again.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Harold is having some trouble taking off. His rotor blades are jammed and need fixing. So today Thomas and Duck are taking him to the Search and Rescue Centre by rail.

THE EARL OF SODOR	But Harold's not designed to travel along the tracks. And I don't think he's enjoying his journey.

THE EARL OF SODOR	How does Harold the helicopter usually travel? Does he swim in the water? Does he fly in the air? Or does he drive on the road? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	(Laughs). Harold flies high in the sky. That way he can travel quickly all around the island...

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Which is jolly useful if you need to rescue someone stranded in a difficult place!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Jolly Well done! Do come back again soon. Goodbye!
