(NEAR AND FAR IVAN)

THOMAS	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER    	Ivan raced through the snowy Russian countryside. As the wind got colder and the snow got deeper, he knew he was nearly home. 

STORYTELLER	But then Ivan met a very chilly looking little steam engine. 'What are you waiting here for?' Ivan asked. 'The coal delivery didn't arrive, so I couldn't fill up and now I'm stuck because I've run out of coal' Said the engine. 

STORYTELLER	'Don't worry, I've got a whole tank full of diesel. I can push you to the next station, then I’ll go and collect some coal for you!'

STORYTELLER	So Ivan buffered up behind the little steam engine...

STORYTELLER     	And pushed him towards the next station. But then...

STORYTELLER	Ivan found a BIG steam engine that had run out of coal too. And this one had some very cold passengers on board.

STORYTELLER	'Don't worry, I still have half a tank of diesel fuel, I'll take you both to the next station!'

STORYTELLER	'Are you sure?' Said the big steam engine. 'I'll be very heavy, especially with all my passengers!'

STORYTELLER	The big engine was right, he was very heavy.

STORYTELLER	But Ivan pushed as hard as he could... 

STORYTELLER	And soon his wheels started to turn. 'Wahey!' 'Well done, Ivan!' 

STORYTELLER	So, Ivan took the two steam engines all the way to the next station.

STORYTELLER    	Then Ivan raced off to collect some coal...

STORYTELLER      	'Those steamies will soon be on the move again!' Said Ivan.

STORYTELLER    	Ivan took the coal to the engines that were waiting at the station.

STORYTELLER      	The steam engines were soon as warm as toast and ready to puff again. 'Thank you!' 

STORYTELLER	'You're welcome! Now I'll be on my way...'

STORYTELLER	But Ivan didn't move... 'Oh dear, I've run out of diesel fuel!'

STORYTELLER	'Don't worry!  'I've got some coal now, I can take you to the fueling depot!'

STORYTELLER     	So the little steam engine pushed Ivan all the way to the fuelling depot.

STORYTELLER    	'Thank you, it seems that steam engines and diesel engines can always help each other!'

THOMAS	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
