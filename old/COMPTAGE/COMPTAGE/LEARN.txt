THOMAS	hello everyone! today i learnt a very important lesson about... not playing rough and tough. diesel is often mean to other engines and acts rough and tough to impress his friends. but one day, i found diesel talking kindly and gently to some fluffy ducklings. diesel was so embarrassed. he was worried his friends wouldn't like him if they thought he was a big softie...so i agreed not to tell anyone about the ducklings, as long as diesel promised to be kind to the other engines. ...but it wasn't long before diesel was being rough and tough again. so i took 'arry and bert to see diesel's ducklings.. 'arry and bert loved the ducklings and they still liked diesel even when he was being kind. diesel learnt his friends would like him even if he wasn't rough and tough.

(END.)
