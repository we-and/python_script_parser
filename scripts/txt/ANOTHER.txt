Henry	Now, if I mention something, do you promise to be civil about it?
Audrey	When you say things like that, I notice I grip the handle of the pan just a little tighter.
Henry	It's not that I don't appreciate everything that you do for me, and the family too.
Audrey	Out with it.
Henry	The hem is a bit short on one side.
Audrey	You're blind.
Audrey	Are you keeping an eye on the time?
Henry	I'm paying attention.
Henry	But look. Look here.
Audrey	They were the same when I did them.
Henry	Yeah, but that's all well and good, but I'll be at the office and I'll be looking like I'm some kind of rapper guy.
Audrey	then replies I highly doubt that anybody is ever going to mistake you for a rapper guy.
Audrey	What time is it?
Audrey	Henry, she's there. Come on, Henry.
Henry	She's early
Audrey	Be Careful. Watch your steps.
Audrey	Shh. Quiet.
Audrey	Watch the baby.
Henry	I can't. I can't get--Get her off of me.
Henry	Got it. Come on!
Shannon	No, No, No!
Audrey	Shh. Keep quiet.
Henry	Shh.
Audrey	Shh. Shh. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
Jackson	Aloha means hello and goodbye.'
Audrey	She's up.
Shannon	Hmm?
Audrey	Oh.
Audrey	Hello. My name is Audrey.-- And this is my husband--Oh. Well, he'll be along. The stairs just take a few extra seconds.
Shannon	Mmm, mmm!
Audrey	There.
Audrey	Uh, as I was saying my name is Audrey, and this is my husband Henry.
Audrey	First and foremost, Shannon, we would like to apologize for scaring you this morning, but after much deliberation, we feel this would be the best way for you to go missing. 
Audrey	By now, you've recognized my husband Henry, or Dr, Walsh as you would better know him.
Henry	Hello, Miss Shannon.
Audrey	Dr. Walsh will continue your care from our home. You should know that we mean you or your unborn child no harm. While we apologize for what we must do, please make no mistake. We must do it, and we will not waiver no matter how much you beg. So, please do not try, as we all have feelings. Do you understand?
Shannon	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Audrey	Do you know that we don't want to hurt you or your baby. Can you nod?
Audrey	I guess that's out of the way, then.
Audrey	Maybe we should get the teste over with.
Henry	Now?
Henry	Give me a minute
Henry	Okay. I'm ready.
Shannon	Help!
Shannon	Please, someone! Please!
Henry	Nothing.
Shannon	Help! Somone, please!
Audrey	Now, nothing or nothing at all?
Henry	We're good.
Shannon	Please!
Audrey	Shh.
Audrey	Listen to me, listen. No one can hear you. We've soundproofed the room. Shh.
Audrey	Now, don't make this any more unpleasant than it already is. 
Audrey	We want you to be comfortable here.
Audrey	For you, and for the sake of the baby.
Audrey	You know, I don't want to have to gag you again, but I will.
Audrey	Do you understand?'
Shannon	Why are you doing this?
Audrey	We need to bring our grandon back, and this is the only way.
Jackson	I can't eat it in the car.
Jackson	Ta-da.
Shannon	Him?
Audrey	What do you see?
Jackson	Finished.
Audrey	You see him?
Audrey	Oh! He knows.
Audrey	He know you're here to save him.
Shannon	I don't know what you’re saying.
Audrey	Jackson, dear. He's dead.
Jackson	Let's make him a little bit higher.
Shannon	Oh, Jesus.
Audrey	Oh, no. We don't use that name in this house.
Audrey	All right. You rest, and I'll bring you some lunch in a little while.
Audrey	Jackie loves music.
Audrey	See?
Shannon	Someone, please!
Shannon	Please help me.
Henry	Have you seen my keys?
Henry	I thought they were in my pocket.
Henry	They're not in my coat.
Henry	What?
Audrey	He showed himself to her.
Henry	No.
Audrey	Mm-hmm.
Henry	That's good, right?
Audrey	Yeah.
Henry	The, umm…
Audrey	…appearing
Henry	Appearing to the host is a good thing, right?
Audrey	Mm-hmm.
Audrey	He's coming back to us.
Henry	You know, I think I'm going to stay home today.
Henry	I'll call and I'll reschedule my app--
Audrey	No.
Audrey	No. Keep up appearances.
Audrey	No changes in our routine.
Henry	You're right.
Audrey	I always am.
Henry	Hmm.
Audrey	Have a great day.
Rory	Well, there's something I didn't think I'd see in this lifetime.
Henry	What?
Rory	You. You're still here.
Rory	I shovel your snow.
Henry	Oh. Ray, right?
Rory	Rory.
Henry	Rory.
Rory	If you give me two minutes, I'll clear you a path here right quick.
Henry	Uh, Mrs. Walsh is pretty sick.
Rory	Everything's all right, I hope?
Henry	Oh, yeah, yeah. She's just come down with something, which is why I'm a little late today. So, I think we should let her rest this morning.
Rory	Of course.
Rory	Now, if you want, I can get my shovel. Whisper quiet, she'll never even know I was here.
Henry	Thank you, but I think we should let her rest.
Rory	Okay, okay. I'll come back in a couple days when she's feeling better.
Henry	Now, if you could just move your truck so I could get out, I'm a tad late for work.
Rory	Ah. Look at me, screwing with your day.
Rory	You wish Mrs. Walsh a speedy recovery,  and you drop me a line anytime you're ready. I'll fix you up.
Henry	Thank you. You have a good day, now.
Rory	You, too.
Audrey	Hello.
Audrey	Time for our morning vitamins.
Audrey	Oh, we can't have Mommy missing out, now, can we?
Audrey	Oop. There.
Audrey	Okay. There you go.
Audrey	No, don’t worry, They're just vitamins.
Audrey	You see?
Audrey	There.
Audrey	All right. I get it.
Audrey	It's been a big morning
Audrey	I will back off.
Shannon	Hey.
Audrey	Don't worry, Don't worry.
Audrey	Oh, oh. You brought your own pills. Are these pre-natals?
Audrey	Gosh. I can't read that.
Audrey	Don't get old.
Audrey	I need to get my glasses.
Audrey	I will be right back.
Audrey	Okey-dokey?
Shannon	Yes.
Shannon	No. No!
Audrey	Give me the phone. Give it to me.
Shannon	No.
Audrey	No extra stress, now. Come on.
Audrey	Thank you.
Audrey	There you go.
Audrey	Let's see.
Audrey	5-0-2-9
Shannon	Stop it.
Audrey	No, no. It's alright. It's all just part of it
Shannon	Give me my fucking phone!
Audrey	Oh, no. Swearing is bad for our baby.
Audrey	There we go.
Audrey	Oh, I'm sorry to paint you as a woman who would do this sort of thing, but it's just a little extra nsurance at our end.
Shannon	No. You don't have to do this.
Shannon	You don’t have to do this! Please.
Audrey	All right. I'm sorry.
Audrey	I'm sorry. I can't do two things at once.
Audrey	Shh. Shh.
Audrey	All right. Okay.
Audrey	Um, let me see.
Audrey	Um--All right.
Audrey	That's good.
Audrey	Would you say Taking a me day? Henry and I went back and forth on that.
Audrey	I said Mommy needs some alone time, but you know, sometimes you just have to let them win.
Audrey	Well, aren't you popular.
Audrey	Oh.
Audrey	DTF?
Audrey	What in the world does that mean?
Audrey	DT Down To Oh, my goodness.
Audrey	Well, no wonder he didn’t spell it out.
Audrey	You know, if you can’t even say it, you shouldn’t be doing it.
Audrey	That's a good rule of thumb, I think.
Audrey	Okay.Um, Meet me at Fairy Lake, 2:00. Send.
Audrey	All right.
Audrey	There we go.
Audrey	There.
Audrey	Hi, dear. Yeah. I just wanted to let you know that the plan worked.
Audrey	I made the call and got the prize.
Henry	Wonderful. You're a full-blown techie now.
Audrey	Have a good day, my love.
Henry	Bye-bye.
Audrey	Belive me when I say we have thought of everything.
Audrey	No one has more time than a grieving family.
Audrey	No one.
Talia	Dr. Walsh, the hospital called. They’re just asking if you can do a review for them.
Henry	Yes, of course.
Henry	Um, good.
Henry	could you make sure you forward that, please?
Talia	Already sent.
Colin	Dr. Walsh.
Henry	Colin.
Colin	Hi.
Henry	To what doe we owe this pleasure?
Colin	First off, I know what you're going to say.
Colin	Yeah. It is entirely possible that I don’t have HPV.
Colin	I'm sorry for my rudeness.
Colin	I'm really stressed out right now, okay?
Henry	All righty.
Colin	And if I could go ahead of you guys, that would be really appreciated.
Henry	Let's go into the back room now--
Talia	You have Ms. Becker right now.
Henry	No, no. She's not until Friday morning.
Talia	No. She rescehduled. She had a couple of questions for you.
Colin	No, no. he's got to help me now.
Henry	Wait, wait. Uh, no. She said--Send an e-mail.
Colin	Help me!
Talia	No, no. I still don’t see anything. Did she e-mail you directly, or--
Henry	No. That's right. I saw her this morning. She was out for a walk--
Colin	I could be done by now. I could be done!
Henry	And she said that she couldn’t make it today.
Talia	Okay. Well, Dr. Walsh, she's 37 weeks. So, is she coming in later today? Because the hostpital eeps asking.
Henry	I have no idea. Could you just help me here, please?
Colin	Dr.Walsh, I swear I have it.
Henry	Yes. Let's go on at the back. Thank you.
Talia	Uh--
Talia	I'm so sorry.
Audrey	Here it is.
Henry	What am I looking at?
Audrey	I found it here this morning
Henry	Okay.
Audrey	Dead, right?
Henry	Well, I'm not going to touch it, but yes, it looks dead.
Audrey	Yeah.
Henry	What are you doing? You can't be carrying that around. It's a thousand years old.
Audrey	I know.
Audrey	Just hold it here. Let me open it.
Henry	Oh.
Audrey	There. Hold that. All right.
Audrey	Just watch.
Audrey	You ready?
Audrey	All right. 
Audrey	Ut aosoth meum sanguinem, dedi sanguinem commutant, ut suus reddet animam pro animam pulmonis apud.
Henry	How did you do that?
Audrey	I found it in the book.
Audrey	I needed to test it to see if it was real. I wasn't sure I believed it
Henry	We can't be bringing dead things to life.
Audrey	Well, I can. I've been doing it all morning.
Henry	All morning?
Audrey	Henry, yes. Do you know what this means?
Audrey	It works. The book is real.
Audrey	We can do this.
Audrey	We're getting him back, my love.
Audrey	Henry?
Audrey	Henry? 
Audrey	You seem nervous.
Henry	Maybe it's because we have a pregnant woman locked up in our house.
Audrey	We have to keep up appearances.
Henry	Got it.
Henry	Hey there, Ian.
Ian	Henry, Audrey.
Audrey	Oh.
Audrey	Thank you so much for the book, Ian. It was a fascinating read.
Ian	I'm glad you liked it.
Ian	You can still keep it if you want.
Audrey	No, no. I read it, dear.
Ian	I know.
Henry	Let's not be late hmm?
Ian		Okay.
Ian	Uh, Henry? Henry? Remember the Beur book you were looking for?
Henry	Oh, yes. Uh, that was just curiosity.
Ian	Yeah. Most subs I'm in don’t think it exists.
Henry	Well, I appreciate you looking.
Ian	Well, I did have a lead.
Ian	I had a lead, but the guy said he sold it.
Ian	And to be honest with you, I think he's full of dog shit.
Audrey	You asked him about it?
Henry	That was before I found it. We were desperate.
Audrey	What if he tells somebody? What if it gets out?
Henry	Well, it won't get out, so stop talking about it.
Yolanda	I have to eat, you know? I mean, everyone has to eat. We're human.
Yolanda	Looks like we're all here.
Yolanda	I trust everyone had a good week?
Man #1	Yep.
Man #2	Had a horrible week.
Yolanda	My boyfriend graciously made snacks for everyone, but if you don’t mind, I'd like to wait until fter to enjoy them.
Yolanda	Excellent.
Yolanda	Let us begin.
Yolanda	Glory be to Satan, the Father of the Earth, and to Lucifer, our guiding light.
Yolanda	As it was in the void of the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, Satan's kingdom without end.
Yolanda	And so it is done.
Everyone	Hail Satan.
Everyone	Hail Satan. Hail Satan.
Everyone	Hail Satan.
Henry	Well, Miss Becker,...
Henry	…I think it's safe to rule out any chance of a tapeworm.
Shannon	Yes. That just leaves me being pregnant.
Henry	It certainly does.
Shannon	Oh, my God. I was kidding.
Henry	I'm so sorry. I--I thought this wold come as welcome news.
Shannon	Thank you.
Henry	You know, there are options.
Henry	Out of state, unfortunately.
Henry	But also, I could talk to the father if you wished.
Shannon	Long gone.
Shannon	Didn't even give me a real name.
Shannon	Plus I don’t really believe in the, uh…option.
Henry	I see.
Shannon	I promise, I usually make good decisions.
Henry	Of course.
Henry	Um--
Henry	What about family or friends? I'm sorry. This really is none of my business.
Shannon	Um,
Shannon	my mom lives in Florida.
Shannon	Um, she might, uh,--
Shannon	Oh, I really don’t want to give her another reason to call me a failure.
Henry	This does not make you a failure.
Shannon	Right.
Shannon	I guess I'm having a baby.
Shannon	Uh
Henry	Oh, yes. You are.
Henry	Oh, I'm sorry.
Henry	Sometimes I can be a little emotional, too.
Shannon	It's refreshing.
Shannon	It's nice to know I'll be in good hands.
Henry	Ah.
Shannon	Uh, I guess I have some planning to do.
Shannon	Uh-- 
Henry	Um, would you mind if I took a photo of you?
Shannon	Uh, a photo?
Henry	Yeah. Just for the records. To match a face to the names. Um, sadly, at my age, my memory needs a bit of a reminder.
Shannon	Sure.
Shannon	I'm sure I look my best.
Shannon	Um, should I say cheese?
Henry	Say miracle.
Shannon	Miracle.
Shannon	No, no!
Shannon	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Audrey	You won't find him here, sweetie.
Shannon	No, no!
Shannon	You don’t have to do this.
Shannon	Please don’t do this.
Shannon	You don’t have to do this.
Shannon	No, no.
Audrey	Just a little bit.
Audrey	It'll only take a minute.
Shannon	Please don’t do this.
Shannon	Please don’t do this.
Audrey	All right. 
Audrey	There you go.
Shannon	You don’t have to do this.
Audrey	The worst--The worst is over.
Audrey	It's all right. All right.
Audrey	We ask for an audience.
Audrey	We wish to invite our dark lord to a seat at the head of our home. We welcome you.
Shannon	Please don’t do this. Please don’t do this.
Audrey	My blood is your blood.
Henry	My blood is your blood.
Shannon	Don’t hurt my baby. Please don’t hurt my baby.
Shannon	Please don’t hurt my baby, no!
Henry	Start reading.
Audrey	Nos invite Surgot in domum nostram.
Audrey	Placere reserare fores condemnabitur.
Henry	Keep going.
Audrey	Rogamus autem vos recludam haec processerat.
Audrey	Hoc reserare in domum suam.
Audrey	I see you!
Audrey	Oh, Jackson.
Audrey	Oh, he's here.
Audrey	Jackson, come and take the baby.
Henry	Go on, Jackie. You can do it.
Henry	Go on. Keep reading.
Audrey	Nos invite mortuis. Nos invitare in domum nostram.
Henry	Are you all right?
Audrey	Yeah. I'm fine.
Audrey	Henry
Henry	She's okay.
Audrey	Let me hear.
Audrey	Here.
Audrey	It’s him.
Henry	Audrey
Audrey	I know my grandon's heartbeat.
Henry	Yes, yes. Of course you do. I'm sorry.
Henry	We did it.
Audrey	Here.
Audrey	I'll put on some tea.
Henry	Aud?
Henry	Had a hell of a time sleeping last night.
Henry	I guess side effects are to be expected.
Henry	Sorry. Bad joke.
Henry	It's all going to work out.
Henry	I had my doubts, 
Henry	but you were right.
Henry	Hello?
Audrey	Henry, can you give me a hand with the groceries?
Audrey	You’re not still in bed, are you?
Henry	Audrey?
Henry	Get away.
Henry	Keep--
Henry	Audrey!
Henry	Audrey!
Audrey	What's wrong?
Audrey		What?
Henry	I, I--You--
Audrey	No. I'm right here. What?
Audrey	What?
Henry	All those things.
Audrey	Well, you just--What?
Audrey	Look. There's nothing there.
Henry	Hello?
Talia	Excuse me, Dr. Walsh.
Talia	There's an officer here to see you.
Henry	An officer?
Talia	Yes. She said she'd like to speak with you.
Henry	I'll be right there.
Talia	Okay.
Detective Bellows	Dr. Walsh?
Henry	Yes?
Detective Bellows	Detective Bellows.
Henry	Is something wrong?
Detective Bellows	I'm looking into a missing persons case.
Detective Bellows	Do you know a Miss Shannon Becker?
Henry	Oh, yes. Of course. She's a patient.
Detective Bellows	Well, unfortunately, she hasn't been to work in a couple of days, and she has quite a few people worried.
Henry	Oh. Well, that’s just awful.
Henry	Um, do you have any leads?
Detective Bellows	Well, we're retracing her steps.
Detective Bellows	Miss Becker had a appointment to see you on the same day that she went missing. What time did she come in?
Henry	Ah. Well, actually, um, she cancelled that day.
Detective Bellows	Do you know when she called?
Detective Bellows	Do you keep phone records, by chance? I'd love to have a listen.
Talia	Actually, she didn’t call.
Detective Bellows	Really?
Talia	Well, remember, I asked you if she called, and then you said that you saw her earlier in the day.
Talia	Right, doctor?
Henry	Oh, right.
Henry	Thank you, Talia. My mistake. Yes. I saw her walking.
Detective Bellows	Walking?
Henry	Uh-huh.
Detective Bellows	And where was this?
Henry	Um--
Detective Bellows	Do you remember what street? Time of day?
Detective Bellows	Anything would be helpful.
Henry	Um, yeah.
Henry	I was on my way to work. She walked by my house. It would've been about 9:00, 9:30.
Henry	Sorry. I should've rememered.
Detective Bellows	Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Detective Bellows	Which street was this?
Henry	My street. Hibiscus Avenue.
Detective Bellows	Thank you.
Detective Bellows	This has been very helpful.
Detective Bellows	Both of you.
Henry	Well, please keep us posted.
Audrey	You're panicking.
Henry	She was in my office.
Audrey	Well, we knew this. It's no a shock, Henry.
Audrey	We planned for it. They came in, and you told them that she'd cancelled her appointment. And then they're look at ther updates and her dating app and see that she met a stranger. We've been all through this.
Henry	Well, there was some confusion. I had to tell the police that I saw her walk--
Audrey	What?
Henry	Well, it's fine. Nothing changes. I just said that I saw her walking and she cancelled.
Audrey	What reason did she give for cancelling?
Henry	Well, we didn't--
Audrey	Well did she go left or right at the bottom of the hill? I mean--
Henry	I know what you're doing.
Audrey	Why were you watching her all the way down to the bottom of the hill? Are you attracted to younger girls, Henry? It's not a plan if you don’t stick to it.
Henry	All right, now.
Henry	I'm sorry. I made a mistake. But we'll go over all this tonight. Okay, Audrey? 
Audrey	Damn it.
Henry	What's the matter?
Audrey	Well, it's probably the police at the door.
Audrey	I'm coming.
Kid	Trick or treat?
Audrey	What?
Kid	Trick or treat?
Audrey	That's not very funny.
Audrey	I don’t like games.
Audrey	Whoever put you up tp this is just cruel.
Audrey	Please don’t knock again.
Kid	Trick or treat?
Kid	Trick or treat?
Audrey	No!
Kid	Trick or treat?
Kid	Please?
Henry	Hello?
Audrey	Henry? Henry, I need help.
Henry	What's wrong?
Audrey	She's trying to get me.
Kid	Trick or treat?
Audrey	Get out!
Henry	Maybe you should giver her your soul.
Audrey	What?
Henry	Trick or treat?
Henry	Trick or treat?
Audrey	What?
Henry	Trick or treat?
Audrey	What?
Henry	Trick or treat? Trick or treat? Trick or treat?
Audrey	Oh. Oh, God.
Audrey	Come on.
Giant Phantom Kid	Trick or treat?
Giant Phantom Kid	Trick or treat?
Giant Phantom Kid	Trick or treat?
Audrey	No.
Shannon	Why were you screaming?
Audrey	Screaming?
Shannon	Earlier. I heard you screaming.
Audrey	My daughter just came to see me.
Audrey	She used to dress as a ghost every year for Halloween.
Audrey	I tried to get her into a princess costume or a ballerina, anything other than that darn ghost.
Audrey	But they like what they like.
Audrey	I can't believe I tried to change that.
Audrey	Seems so silly now, when I look back.
Shannon	Where's your dughter now?
Audrey	I love my Jackson.
Audrey	And Jackson loves his gammy's cookies.
Audrey	I'm going to make some right now.
Shannon	Whoa, whoa!
Audrey	I can't get the door open.
Henry	What the hell is going on?
Henry		She's all stitched up.
Henry	No real damage
Audrey	I'm so sorry
Henry	No.
Henry	Whatever this is, we both did it.
Audrey	You know, I think we’re in over our heads.
Henry	Well, we can't Google this.
Audrey	Do you think we made a mistake?
Henry	Let’s get some sleep.
Shannon	Good morning.
Henry	Right on schedule.
Shannon	If I don’t do it in the morning, I don’t do it.
Shannon	And someone seems to crave the consistency.
Henry	Better get used to it.
Henry	Pretty soon, that little person will be calling all the shots.
Shannon	I am.
Henry	Sorry?
Shannon	Um, getting used to it, I mean.
Shannon	I know I was apprehensive. But, uh, I was laying in bed the other day worrying about bills and formula. And all of a sudden, this little mush starts squirming.
Henry	Yeah, right.
Shannon	It made all my worries go away.
Shannon	I finally found my family.
Henry	They do have a way go getting into your heart, don’t they?
Shannon	They really do.
Henry	Well, I'm glad that you’re excited to be a mom.
Shannon	You have no idea. Um, I'll see you Thursday?
Henry	Wouldn’t miss it.
Audrey	Are there more?
Henry	Yes.
Audrey	How can you tell?
Henry	I tend to notice a murder of crows in my backyard.
Audrey	It's because of what we did?
Henry	Yep.
Henry	Its because of what we did.
Henry	Oh, no.
Audrey	What's he doing here?
Henry	Go on upstairs. Keep her quiet.
Rory	Dr. Walsh? Morning. I'm here to clean your drive.
Henry	Uh, Yeah. I thought we talked about this. We're still okay.
Rory	Pretty sure you and I got a different meaning of okay.
Henry	Yes, but I called, though.
Rory	What's that?
Henry	Um, after last time, uh, I called your wife, and I explained that I wouldn’t need you for a month or two. We're not firing you or anything. We just don’t need you.
Rory	Oh, boy. Full discloure here, doc.
Rory	I havent been home in a while.
Henry	Is that right?
Rory	The number you calld is Jenny.
Rory	On account of taxes, everything's in her name, and she's gone ad chucke me.
Rory	I mean, I get it. I made a mistake.
Rory	A stupid, stupid mistake.
Rory	And now, will you look at all this, huh?
Rory	I'm going to lose my business, my home. Cripes she won't even let me see my two girls.
Rory	How the hell is that fair?
Henry	I'm sorry to hear that, Rory. But maybe you could, um, send her some flowers or something.
Rory	Oh! What am I doing?
Rory	This isn't on you.
Rory	No. Uh--
Rory	That's it. It's over. No more.
Henry	Well, that's good to know.
Henry	Um, I'll be seeing you, then, Rory.
Rory	No, no, no. I'm not leaving. You're getting a freebie.
Henry	No, no. Everything's okay.
Rory	No. It’s settled. You need it. I need it. Done-zo. I am hooking you up.
Audrey	Henry?
Henry	What the hell was that?
Audrey	Don't yell at me. I am not a doctor.
Audrey	I thought you told me you cancelled him?
Henry	I did! He woudn't take no for an answer.
Rory	Hey!
Rory	Hey!
Henry	Oh…
Rory	Hey, Mrs. Walsh!
Henry	Wave.
Rory	Hi!
Henry	Smile.
Rory	Glad you're feeling better!
Audrey	Thank you, Rory.
Henry	Hey. Hey...What's wrong?
Audrey	I just…I don’t know what the other ghosts are. I don’t know whay they're here.
Audrey	What if we did it all wrong?
Audrey	What if -- What if Jackson's not--
Henry	No. In a few days, we'll have Jackson back, we'll head to Mexico…
Audrey	Okay.
Henry	And I'll burn this house down, ghosts and all. I promise.
Rory	Hey!
Rory	You did it right. Jackson's in there.
Rory	He's coming back to you.
Shannon	Stay the hell away from me.
Audrey	No, I-I'm just here to clean you, nothing else.
Audrey	All right.
Audrey	There we go.
Audrey	Oh…
Audrey	Wrists are just not getting any blood circulaton.
Audrey	Please don’t move.
Audrey	There.
Audrey	Okay.
Audrey	This will just make it a lot…softer for you. Okay?
Audrey	I hope this works.
Audrey	You ready?
Audrey	There. How does that feel?
Shannon	Are you gonna kill me?
Shannon	When this is over
Shannon	and you have your grandson back?
Shannon	You’re not saying anything.
Audrey	There's…
Audrey	a…lot of words in silence.
Shannon	Does that mean yes?
Audrey	Shannon, the first rule we set for ourselves was that you cannot get hurt.
Audrey	You know, you remind me of her.
Shannon	Your daughter?
Audrey	She was such a good girl.
Audrey	She was always so much smarter than the other kids.
Audrey	She always knew what she wanted.
Shannon	Did you try and bring her back?
Audrey	I don’t think she can come back.
Audrey	She was in the car, but…
Audrey	We didn't lose her right away.
Audrey	We…we renovated this house to give her everything she needed.
Audrey	Henry and I tried to make her as comfortable as possible, so that she could…try to move on.
Audrey	But…
Audrey	I didn’t realize how impossible it is to move on after losing a child…
Audrey	until I lost mine.
Audrey	But you know, I know that she would be happy knowing that youre helping bring our Jackson back.
Henry	Oh, God damn it.
Henry	Yes. Hello?
Detective Bellows	Dr. Walsh?
Henry	It is.
Detective Bellows	This is Detective Bellows. We met a few days ago at your office.
Henry	Uh-huh.
Detective Bellows	Sorry to disturb you. I'm just following up on a few notes. I remembered you saying you saw Miss Becker walking the morning she went missing.
Detective Bellows	I wondered if I could come see you for a quick chat?
Henry	Uh, yes, of course.
Henry	Always happy to help.
Henry	Have you had any luck in finding Miss Becker?
Henry	Um… I saw on the news that you might have got a suspect.
Detective Bellows	I'm not at liverty to discuss that with you.
Henry	No, of course. I was just, uh, concerned about her. You know that, um, she-- she's due to give birthany day now.
Detective Bellows	Uh-huh. Can I come by your house?
Henry	Well, actually, I'm out right now. But how about we meet at the clinic tomorrow morning first thing?
Detective Bellows	Aww, Doctor, time is of the essence in these circumstances, you understand.
Henry	Well, of course. Um…Yes. You know, I--acturally, I could be there in--in--in an hour.
Detective Bellows	I'm actually in your neighbourhood. Let's meet at your house.
Henry	Ahh!
Shannon	I would help.
Audrey	What do you mean?
Shannon	Be Jackson's mom…
Shannon	with you and Dr. Walsh.
Audrey	You're just saying that.
Audrey	Yeah, Henry told me that--that you would try and use my emotions against me.
Audrey	Shame on you.
Shannon	I'm not-- I…
Shannon	I…I don’t agree with this, but…
Shannon	I understand it.
Shannon	Doing anything for him.
Shannon	I'm just trying to do the same for my baby.
Audrey	I don’t know.
Shannon	You and Dr. Walsh aren't young.
Shannon	You're gonna need someone to look after Jackson.
Shannon	You can lock me up in a room. I don't care. I just--I just-- I just want to be a part of the baby's ife.
Audrey	Do you really think you could do that?
Audrey	like, if I talk to Henry. You're not just saying it?
Shannon	I do. I'll od whatever you want.
Shannon	Please.
Audrey	I'm sorry.
Audrey	I'll come back and take that off in a minute.
Detective Bellows	Henry Walsh!
Audrey	Henry, I tried to stop her!
Detective Bellows	Place your hands on your head and get on your knees.
Henry	Are you okay, my love?
Audrey	Henry, I'm so sorry!
Detective Bellows	Henry Walsh, get down on your knees now.
Shannon	Let me go!
Audrey	I'm sorry.
Audrey	Let me up.
Henry	No, it's all me, Officer. Please. My--my wife had nothing to do with this. Please. Please, let her go.
Shannon	Let me up, please. You have to help my baby.
Detective Bellows	Dr. Walsh, I am placing you under arrest for the kidnapping of Miss Shannon Becker.
Shannon	Help my baby.
Shannon	Please!
Shannon	Please, no! Just let me out of here.
Detective Bellows	Miss Becker, calm down.
Shannon	You have to let me out.
Detective Bellows	I know you're afraid but it's all over now.
Detective Bellows	I just have to do this one thing.
Audrey	Oh, Henry…
Audrey	It can't be…
Audrey	Can you help me? Henry…
Henry	There we go.
Audrey	Oh my God.
Henry	Don't look. Did she call for backup?
Audrey	I don’t know.
Henry	The cop.
Audrey	What?
Henry	Did she call for backup?
Audrey	No, no.
Henry	No?
Audrey	No, she heard Becker.
Audrey	I tried to get rid of her, Henry. I tried to get rid of her.
Henry	I know. Let's-- let's get her away from here.
Audrey	What?
Henry	Come on.
Audrey	Oh my God.
Henry	I'll get an arm, you get an arm. Get her arm. Come on.
Audrey	Where are we gonna take her?
Henry	Back side, just right in the corner.
Audrey	All right. All right.
Henry	Good.
Audrey	Will you please stop that?
Henry	I'm nervous.
Audrey	I'm aware.
Audrey	We need to talk about Becker.
Audrey	She and I were chatting. I-I know I'm always the one yelling about plans, but just hear me out.
Henry	Later, okay?
Ian	Do you acyually have it? Like, actually have it?
Henry	Come inside.
Ian	Where did you find this?
Henry	I went to a museum. Talked to some historians.
Henry	One of them sent me to another guy, and another guy.
Henry	Eventually, I flew to Jerusalem and bought it off a very shady-looking individual, who seemed only too please to be rid of it.
Ian	How much did it cost?
Henry	Well, we don’t have a retirement plan left.
Audrey	Can you read it, Ian?
Ian	Of course I can read it.
Ian	Some of it, not all of it.
Ian	It looks like it was written over… a bunch of years. There's  different languages, there's different dialects and religions. 
Ian	This might be the oldest book in the world.
Henry	Ian?
Henry	We're friends, right? 
Ian	I don’t have friends.
Audrey	But we're bound to each other with the church.
Ian	Of course.
Henry	So…
Henry	could you show what you make of this here, where it says the invoking, where you can invite a spirit into a new vessel?
Ian	Well, first of all, you can’t invite a specific…
Henry	Wh-h-what if we did?
Ian	Then, I'd be an idiot for standing here. So…
Henry	It's okay.
Ian	Okay.
Ian	You guys…
Ian	need to tell me exactly, exactly…
Audrey	Uh-huh.
Ian	…what you did right now.
Audrey	Um,…okay, well, we, uh--yeah, we asked this one to bring us back our grandson back.
Ian	You asked Surgat to bring him back?
Henry	The book said he could.
Ian	No. Henry…your translations are so far off.Yes, this is Surgat, the demon who unlocks the gate between us and tormented souls. And, yes, technically, he is the first step in bringing …someone back, but it's not a private goddamn VIP invitation.
Ian	Okay, once that gate is opened, every ghost in purgatory is gonna be crawling to find a host.
Ian	What host did you use?
Ian	is she alive?
Audrey	Yes. Uh, sedated.
Ian	When did you-- when did you do it?
Audrey	A few days ago.
Ian	This is hers?
Henry	No. That's… someone else's.
Audrey	Is Jackson in there?
Ian	Who's Jackson?
Henry	Um, our grandson--the reason that we're doing this.
Ian	Oh. Um...
Ian	No.
Ian	But he can be. He can be. 
Ian	You guys only did half the ceremony.
Ian	I'm not gonna… praise you for your choices, but… you actually did the right thing.
Ian	Now, you need to follow up.
Ian	Trade the life, invite him in.
Audrey	Trade?
Ian	The mother trades her life, so the tormented can come back.
Henry	You-- you think that you can perform this?
Ian	Of course I can.
Ian	I studied my whole life for this.
Ian	I just can't believe it's real.
Ian	I get to keep the book when we're done.
Henry	Of course.
Ian	And $10,000 as well.
Ian	I don’t have a lot of money and…you seem to have more.
Audrey	No problem.
Henry	When do you think that you could do this?
Henry	How quickly?
Ian	ASAP. As soon as possible.
Ian	Tomorrow work for you guys?
Ian	I'm gonna have to get some stuff.
Ian	I'm assuming you've seen some ghosts, huh?
Audrey	Mm-hmm.
Ian	You're gonna need salt, ...
Ian	rock salt, kosher only.
Ian	Spread it all around this…woman here.
Ian	That unborn baby's literally a free ticket back to life for those things.
Henry	Salt keeps them away?
Ian	I don’t fucking know, Henry.
Ian	But I've read it helps, so do it. Okay?
Ian	And put it around yourselves, too.
Ian	You aren't ideal, but they're not picky.
Ian	I think I'm gonna..go.
Ian	I don’t really feel safe bing here…until we do this.
Shannon	He says you have to kill me.
Henry	Mm-hmm.
Shannon	Mrs. Walsh said that I could be the mom to Jackson.
Shannon	Did she talk to you about that?
Shannon	How many more people have to die just to bring your grandson back?
Henry	All of them. Whatever it takes.
Henry	Rory, the cop, you, me.
Henry	You can't win a moral argument with me.
Henry	I've made a deal with the devil.
Shannon	You haven't made the deal yet.
Henry	I made that deal the day we lost Jackson.
Shannon	I know you love him.
Henry	Her.
Henry	When it happened, she couldn't remember a thing, but I know that she was distracted.
Henry	She couldn't resist fussing over Jackson, especially on car rides.
Shannon	She was driving a car?
Henry	I realize that she couldn’t accept what happened and I couldn’t expect her to…come back up.
Henry	So…
Henry	I joined her, going back down.
Shannon	You're doing all this for her?
Henry	I do everything for her.
Henry	I'm sorry.
Shannon	People saysorry instead of fixing things.
Shannon	You could fix this, but you choose not to.
Shannon	So…you aren't.
Henry	What if--
Shannon	I hope that happens for the rest of your life.
Ian's Mom	Ian, come to supper please.
Ian	Not hungry.
Ian's Mom	I'll keep it warm in the oven for you.
Ian's Mom	Are you sure you don’t want something? Just a little?
Ian's Mom	Sweetie, I really don’t mind. I'll bring it down to you.
Ian	Not fucking hungry!
Ian	Henry?
Ian	Audrey?
Ian	Guys?
Ian	Guys?
Audrey	She's been doing that all night.
Henry	Don't step on the salt.
Ian	Okay.
Ian	Turn to the page with the bookmark, read it.
Henry	Hoc autem--
Ian	Hoc au-tem.
Henry	Hoc autem satanas in domum suam, invenit eum coram te relinquo.
Audrey	What does it mean?
Ian	The salt slows them down…
Ian	The sacrafice keeps them away.
Ian	This will help keep them out…
Ian	until…
Ian	we're ready…to do this.
Ian	Don’t disturb it, please.
Ian	One of you starts with…this.
Ian	I know it's in here…somewhere.
Ian	One of you starts with this.
Ian	The other, come with me.
Ian	One, two, three, four, five, six.
Ian	Here. Here
Ian	You know when it comes time, youre gonna have to be the one to kill her, Henry. I can't do that for you.
Henry	You don’t hve to worry about that. I'll take care of it.
Ian	You can't hesitate.
Ian	Okay? Is he senses that you're not ready, Henry…
Ian	Henry!
Ian	…we'll all die. We'll all die. I'm not saying this to be mean, but this is your deal.
Ian	I'm just here to broker it.
Henry	I told you, I'll take care of it.
Henry	Ian, this will work, right?
Ian	He's listening, Henry.
Ian	He actually wants to hear you.
Ian	Please don't ever doubt him in my presence again.
Ian	Three more to go.
Shannon	Is it today?
Audrey	It is.
Shannon	And you spoke to Dr. Walsh? About me coming with you? Raising Jackson with you?
Audrey	We did.
Audrey	He thinks it’s a great idea.
Shannon	So, when this is over and you have Jackosn, with the ceremony, …you're gonna let me out of these?
Audrey	We are.
Audrey	We're --we're even gonna have a room for you, with a crib and everything.
Shannon	I was thinking, uh,  maybe we could send my mom a picture. Of the baby  when he's born?
Shannon	We're not close, but, uh…
Shannon	She'll still be really excited to be a grandma.
Audrey	Well, that's a great idea. Let's do that.
Shannon	I'm kind of hungry.
Shannon	I…I just want to make sure I have my strength for this.
Audrey	Okay.
Audrey	Let me fix you soemthing.
Audrey	Shannon ?
Shannon	Mrs. Walsh!
Shannon	Mrs. Walsh!
Audrey	What?
Shannon	My water broke.
Audrey	Oh my goodness.
Audrey	Henry! Henry!
Ian	She never starts meetins with a blessing, she never acknowledges the work that I do to make those meetings even fucking happen.
Ian	You thought that twat could help you with this?
Henry	No, no.You're certainly the one that should be running it.
Ian	Yeah. She doesn't even care about the church. She's a stupid…stupid skank.
Henry	Speak of the devil.
