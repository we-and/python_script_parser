NOLA	Peace and Blessings, My Parents had decided to spend the Holiday with my Father’s Parents. I couldn’t go because my Boss Miss Raqueletta Moss wouldn’t let me off work yesterday, so here I am in the Republic of Brooklyn. To Me, Thanksgiving is about appreciating Family, Love and Life. I give Thanks to The Most High for a Great Mom and Dad who definitely let me DO ME and BE ME. They have supported from the Git- Go me being an Artist, to express who I am and who I hope to become through my Art. The way I see Me as opposed to how others see Me. Of course, Thanksgiving is also a Grim Reminder of This Country’s Genocide of Our Native Peoples, the Forced Occupation Slash Takeover Slash Total Bogarting of their LAND. Much like how modern Gentrifiers have BUM- RUSHED HOODS All across God’s formally green Planet. In any case, Happy Thanksgiving. May you share it today amongst Beloved Family and friends in these very interesting times we all live in.

JAMIE	It's tasty.
GREER	Sweet.
MARS	I can taste The Vanilla, know what I mean?
NOLA	That's My Mom’s Secret Ingredient. She made The Pies.
JAMIE	What's the real purpose of inviting all Three of us here?
GREER	Yeah, what is this all about?
MARS	That's the Element in the Room.
GREER	Elephant.
MARS	First thing we agreed on All Night.
NOLA	I would like you all to know that the only reason I’m doing this is because you Men think you know me. You think you know what I’m about and the Truth is you don’t know. I Mess up, just like we all do but I try not to punish myself for my mistakes. You know, like I don't see the Point? The World is too ready to punish us anyway. So if in the End you get something good out of this then that’s cool too. But this is for me. I consider myself Abnormal and I really don't want to be like anybody else. I don't. You've all called me a Freak and I Hate that Word. I don’t believe  in it. I guess, what I'm trying to say is the world has made me the man of my Dreams.
NOLA	That’s a MeShell Ndegeocello album. Nobody?
MARS	That's my girl.
JAMIE	We all appreciate your candor but I don’t believe you answered the questions.
GREER	Why are we all here?
NOLA	You've each asked me about the other Dude, Well you, you, you. You're the “other Dude.” I feel so much better. Did I answer all your questions?
JAMIE	Sort of.
NOLA	What don’t you understand?
GREER	Oh no,we understand...
MARS	...We just don’t like it.
NOLA	Well, that’s for you to deal with.
GREER	What kind of a Lady...
NOLA	...Acts like a Man?
JAMIE	Tasty.
GREER	Sweet.
MARS	I taste The Vanilla, You know what I mean?
GREER	(Subtitle) Darling. My love. No, these hands are far too gentile for dish water. Let me help you.
NOLA	I'm good but thank you.
GREER	Please? (Subtitle) Come on... Please?
NOLA	Go relax.
GREER	Fine.
MARS	I love washing Dishes. I ever tell you My first job was as was a Dishwasher.
NOLA	No you haven't, but Rule number Sixty-Eight: My Guests do not help wash dishes.
MARS	Rule number Sixty-Nine, Nola has too many Rules. Good Luck.
JAMIE	Hey.
NOLA	Hey hey. I’m surprised you could make it.
JAMIE	Yeah, my Family, we usually have an Early Thanksgiving Dinner.
NOLA	How did you get away?
JAMIE	During Dessert Cheryl and I got into it and she told me to leave the House. To be honest, I wasn’t planning on being here when I got the invite.
NOLA	Sorry.
JAMIE	I’m here.
NOLA	You are.
JAMIE	If I’d known there would be other invited Guest I...
NOLA	What? “It’s Complicated”?
JAMIE	I won’t speak on behalf of Greer and Mars but this is highly uncomfortable.
NOLA	And sometimes being uncomfortable can be a good thing, you know. It forces us to React, Move, Evolve.
JAMIE	Is that what we’re doing?
NOLA	You tell me.
JAMIE	Why do you always answer and Question with a Question?
NOLA	What?
JAMIE	You ain’t right.
NOLA	Whatever.
JAMIE	Yeah you ain't right. I got a Real Estate Agent looking for an Apartment for you. Your Life, Your art and us.
NOLA	Thank you for the kind offer but no can do. I’m a Strong, Independent Black Woman and God Willing I will get to a place where I can be fending for myself.
JAMIE	Everybody needs Help.
NOLA	Yeah, and The Catlett Prize has been a Big Help.
JAMIE	I’m Happy about that for you.
NOLA	Thank you. Truth be told, I'm just like what if Cheryl cancels another Check or... I can't go through that kind of embarrassment again, Jamie. You Feel Me? Do you?
JAMIE	You're right, you're right, I feel you but I don't feel good about it.
NOLA	Come on, let's hum... We’re being rude to the other guests.
JAMIE	The other guests...
NOLA	Who wants to partake? Who's ready to Get Down To the Nitty Gritty?
MARS	Yo, I'm down.
NOLA	I get this from my Jamaica Weed Guy. Special blend, All Natural. It goes by the Moniker of White Gold. My Mr. Jamaica calls this the Truth Serum. This Cannabis Breaks Down all the Bullshit. All the masks, Facades,  Fronting and stunting. Puff puff pass.
JAMIE	Oh, he don't know the rotation.
NOLA	I got the Truth for y'all. Follow me.
JAMIE	What's this?
NOLA	This is my Latest work of Art. You ready? I call it the 3 HEADED MONSTER.
MARS	WHAT THE FUCK, NOLA!
GREER	You can say that again.
JAMIE	Is this how you think of us?
NOLA	The Beautiful Thing about Art is it’s OPEN to Interpretation.
MARS	This fo sho is some Abstractachalism and  Shit.
NOLA	Objectification is a BITCH. Right?
GREER	Well Nola got one thing right. I've got the  Biggest Member.
JAMIE	Hold up, you don’t have the Girth. The WidthI possess. Nola, you can bet your last money  it's all gonna be a stone gas, honey.
MARS	Like My Late Father Monty told me, Son, you got to work with what you got. So let me tell Y’all, NOLA don’t mind ‘cause I DO IT TO HER MIND. Bang bang!
NOLA	Alright, okay, alright. What's the verdict, did I body this or what?
JAMIE	You took shit to Another Level.
GREER	Next Level.
MARS	Dope Fleek.
GREER	Well this has been FUN. Nola, Thank you but I am going to bid You Adieu.
NOLA	Why, It’s still so early. Excusez-moi.
JAMIE	I bought the vintage french wine.
MARS	You know I gifteded her that album.
GREER	Flowers by Greer Childs.
ITIS CRAWL	Hello. For All of You uninformed Folks. The Definition of Da “ITIS” according To The Urban Dictionary is “The General Feeling of Lethargy, sleepy and Well-Being experienced after Devouring a Satisfying Meal like Thanksgiving. This Phenomenon is particularly triggered by Carbohydrates and Meats containing the Amino Acid Tryptophan. Da “ITIS” is a Common Negroidal Tendency. Ya dig? Sho-Nuff.
NOLA	Oh, What A Thanksgiving Night. As you've observed I have a “Rashamon Effect” on the Treacherous Three. My Lovers Jamie, Greer  and Mars. They all view me differently but they also all want to Possess Me. And I will not allow them to put me in a Box, To Paint  My Life as They see fit. I dealing with who I am now at this very special Moment in Time and Space. I got to look within to feel and understand what makes me Happy. And If Jamie Overstreet, Greer Childs and Mars “Crazy motherfucker” Blackmon want to Deal with ME it must be, has to be on my Terms or it ain’t gonna happen. That’s why I painted the 3 HEADED MONSTER. That Artwork is about being Open, Shiny and not Shadowy, it's about the Truth and I understand often that is the Hardest thing to Get To, to Land at a Place where Folks can find openness, Candor and Frankness amongst Each Other. I feel I demonstrate that first and foremost through my Art. And whatever you feel about my personal Truths... that’s on you. Oh shit, I almost forgot I gotta give a LOVE SHOUT OUT To My Soul sisters. I love you Mekka, Clorinda, Miss Raqueletta Moss and Reggie, Skylar and her Mom Opal. Love You Black.
NOLA	Who IS It?
OPAL	Nola, it’s me, Opal.
NOLA	What are you doing here?
OPAL	Skylar’s father is in town for Thanksgiving and she’s spending the night with him. I've got this bottle of Champagne that I thought we could share. Nola Darling.
