NOAH	Dude, working late doesn't make you smarter than the rest of us.

RAJESH	Hey.

NOAH	Hey. Rajesh, you've got some pixels out.

NOAH	Email Eddie and he'll replace that monitor for you.

RAJESH	Thanks, Noah.

RAJESH	It's not the screen.

NOAH	What is it?

NOAH	Problem with the dish? Maybe a bird landed on it or something.

RAJESH	No. No.

RAJESH	That's crazy, it could be...

RAJESH	You'd better wake up, Dr. Picciotto!

NOAH	What is it?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Dark matter.

DR. PICCIOTTO	Get me a triangulation.

RAJESH	Yeah.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Oh my god.

RAJESH	What is it?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	It's falling straight for us.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	This is Dr. Picciotto. Get me the Pentagon.

MATT	Johanna, have you seen my flashlight? The big metal one?

JOHANNA	You mean this?

MATT	Oh, geez. Sorry.

MATT	I'm gonna be late. Rick's practice get's out

MATT	in half an hour.

JOHANNA	Just try to relax, Matt. This is supposed to be fun, remember?

CASSIE	Oh gross!

MATT	Gross? You're gross!

CASSIE	No, you are!

MATT	I don't know. Pretty soon, you're going to want

MATT	to be smooching somebody yourself.

CASSIE	Never.

JOHANNA	Cassie, can you go get your sister

JOHANNA	your dad's ready to go.

CASSIE	Kaley!

KALEY	What?

JOHANNA	Are you sure we shouldn't be doing this together?

MATT	No, not really.

MATT	You know. I feel like it'd be good if you stayed here and

MATT	you bonded with the girls and I've got a son with a serious

MATT	case of teenage-itis in desperate need of some

MATT	father and son time... I think. I hope.

MATT	There's one thing I do know for sure.

JOHANNA	Hmm.

MATT	I'm sure that I love you.

JOHANNA	I love you.

KALEY	You're leaving?

MATT	Yeah! Picking up Rick from practice.

MATT	We'll be back Sunday night, okay? So come here.

MATT	Okay.

MATT	There might not be any cell service up there.

MATT	So, why don't we try the short waves again?

KALEY	I haven't used that thing since i was her age.

KALEY	I don't even know where it is.

MATT	Okay, well, you ladies have a good weekend and play nice!

MATT	Alright.

JOHANNA	I love you.	

MATT	See you, Sunday.

JOHANNA	Bye

JOHANNA	So... What shall we do tomorrow?

JOHANNA	Volleyball? Motocross again?!

JOHANNA	I could teach you girls rock climbing.

CASSIE / KALEY	Mani-pedi!

MATT	Come on. Enough with the phone already, alright?

MATT	You haven't said two words since i picked you up.

RICK	I can't believe you picked me up in the Grunt mobile.

RICK	Why'd you even buy this thing anyhow?

MATT	Well, you know we need something for camping,

MATT	and military surplus was a lot cheaper than a brand new Jeep.

MATT	Besides, this thing

MATT / RICK	can go anywhere and do anything.

RICK	Yeah. But why you have to pick me up at school?

RICK	All my friends think you're-

MATT	The coolest dad ever?

RICK	An environmental terrorist.

MATT	Alright.

RICK	You know this thing gets like ten miles in a gallon.

MATT	You thought it was cool when we got it.

MATT	You even helped me fix it up, remember?

RICK	I was ten. I handed you tools.

MATT	Well... Johanna thinksit's cool.

MATT	Hey, look, Rick. Your mom's been gone for awhile now. Okay?

MATT	And we can't live in grief forever.

MATT	Alright, Jo's family now. You don't have to love her

MATT	but you gotta get along with her.

MATT	Okay. She'll never be your mother, but-

RICK	She's not old enough to be my mother!

RICK	You're such a cliché.

MATT	Alright, we're all just people just doing the best we can okay?

MATT	And you're playing the angry teenager cliche pretty well yourself.

RICK	Yeah, well, one of us has to act our age.

RAJESH	It's definitely at zero.

RAJESH	It's accelerating at point 5 C.

RAJESH	That's impossible.

NOAH	Rajesh! Rajesh! Rajesh!

NOAH	It's accelerating towards us.

RAJESH	How can that be?

RAJESH	Gravity's a bitch. Less than eight hours now.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Well the Secretary of Defense,

DR. PIOCIOTTO	the President's Science Advisor, the Nasa Administrator,

DR. PIOCIOTTO	the Director of Astrophysical research at JPL,

DR. PIOCIOTTO	dozens of top scientists from around the world,

DR. PIOCIOTTO	and I, all agree.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	There's nothing we can do to stop it.

NOAH	Nothing?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	They've put the military on alert, recalled all off-duty

DR. PIOCIOTTO	personnel and initiated continuity of government plans,

DR. PIOCIOTTO	but there's no way to stop what's going to happen.

NOAH	What about warning the public? Evacuations?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	It would just cause panic.

NOAH	What's gonna happen?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	I'm still not certain,

DR. PIOCIOTTO	but i suspect we are all going to get a pretty

DR. PIOCIOTTO	good idea of how the dinosaurs felt.

RAJESH	What should we do, Professor?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Call your families.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	And then set up connections with every earth observatory,

DR. PIOCIOTTO	every ground station, every earth monitor, everywhere.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Keep the information flowing.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	And learn everything we can about dark matter.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	It may be the last thing that science ever does.

MATT	There should be good fishing this time of year.

MATT	I could show you some of those jujitsu moves that you always

MATT	wanted me to teach you when I was taking those classes.

RICK	Yeah that was before I found out that your

RICK	teacher was moving in with us.

MATT	Here. Be useful.

RICK	In 3.8 miles, you're going to turn right onto "Dirt Road."

RICK	Sounds promising.

MATT	Dirt Road? It sounds like an adventure.

NEWS REPORTER	Traffic in downtown DC was snarled for

NEWS REPORTER	hours today by a surprise disaster preparedness

NEWS REPORTER	mobilization. Metro police provided no further comment or

NEWS REPORTER	explanation of why the exercise was not previously announced.

NEWS REPORTER	Also, today the president left the White House for

NEWS REPORTER	an unscheduled visit at Camp David.

NEWS REPORTER	The White House Press Secretary said the trip was a much need

NEWS REPORTER	break for the president to spend time with his family

NEWS REPORTER	and closest friends.

MATT	Alright, let's see if we can do this. Know how to do it?

MATT	Here. Help me out.

MATT	Not off to a good start.

MATT	Okay.

MATT	So, how's school?

RICK	Fine.

MATT	Just fine? You don't want to expand on that at all?

RICK	Nope.

MATT	It's gonna be hot, huh?

RICK	Yeah.

MATT	Yeah. Okay.

MATT	Well, you know I was at the grocery store yesterday.

MATT	It's a funny story actually.

MATT	Is this right?

RICK	Yeah.

MATT	And, uh, I was at the check out.

MATT	And this, the cashier asked me if I wanted my milk in a bag,

MATT	and I said, "No I'd rather keep it in a carton."

RICK	Are you kidding me?

MATT	[ laughing ]

MATT	Come on. Lighten up a little bit. Come on.

RICK	Are you trying to make this miserable for me?

MATT	Come on. Pull.

MATT	Ta da.

RICK	About time.

RICK	No service.

MATT	That's kinda the point.

MATT	I really hope that we can talk this weekend, Ricky.

RICK	What's there to talk about? You married her for you,

RICK	and me and the girls just have to live with it.

MATT	You know, I think she'd be good for you

MATT	if you just gave her a chance.

RICK	Sure.

MATT	Fishing tomorrow?

RICK	Sure, Dad.

MATT	Good night, Ricky.

RICK	Good night, Dad.

RAJESH	Twenty seconds.

RAJESH	Definitely northern Alaska.

NOAH	I've got video feed from the ISS!

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Put it on the big screen.

RAJESH	Ten, nine, eight...

NOAH	I'm tapped into the USGS seismic network.

RAJESH	Five, four...

RAJESH	... three, two, one!

RAJESH	Oh my god.

JOHANNA	It's okay. It's okay.

JOHANNA	Just stay calm. It's just a head wound.

JOHANNA	They look a lot worse then they are.

JOHANNA	What you should do is take your sleeve and put pressure on it.

JOHANNA	It's okay,

JOHANNA	I took a spill on my dirt bike once and it was

JOHANNA	bleeding worse than that.

JOHANNA	But after a few minutes, it was okay.

JOHANNA	Can you find a clean part of your sleeve

CASSIE	[ screams ]

JOHANNA	[ coughing ]

JOHANNA	Okay, that's going tokeep happening.

KALEY	We need to get out of here! [ coughing ]

JOHANNA	Yes we do. I'm going to get you girls out of here

JOHANNA	and we're going to go get your dad.

KALEY	Should we use the stairs?

JOHANNA	Look.

JOHANNA	We're in a little bit of trouble.

JOHANNA	But it's going to be okay.

JOHANNA	Just- just keep calm and do what I say.

MATT	Come here, Hey Rick, Hey. Rick! Rick!

RICK	I Can't.

MATT	We've got to keep climbing.

RICK	I can't. Someone will come.

MATT	No. Come on. We've got to keep climbing,

MATT	no body's gonna save us, alright? We have to keep going.

RICK	I never should have come on this trip.

MATT	How could I have known this would happen?

RICK	I used to think you were an action hero!

RICK	I used to think you could do anything!

RICK	I thought I could be safe whenever I was with you!

RICK	And now you're just a stereotype for a mid-life crisis!

RICK	And it's going to get us both killed.

MATT	Look, Rick. No mater what I've done, okay?

MATT	No matter what it looks like.

MATT	I'm still the same on the inside that I have always been.

MATT	Okay?

MATT	I'm still the same father that I've always been to you okay?

MATT	And I will never ever let anything happen to you!

MATT	Lookout!

MATT	Ricky! Hey. Ricky.

RICK	[ grunts ]

JOHANNA	[ groans ]

JOHANNA	Stop, stop, stop.

CASSIE	What do we do?

KALEY	My phone!

CASSIE	Try Dad!

JOHANNA	The cell towers are all probably down.

JOHANNA	It was a big quake.

CASSIE	We could try calling for help again.

JOHANNA	Girls, cover your heads.

JOHANNA	Okay, on three. One, two, three-

JOHANNA / CASSIE / KALEY	HELP!!!!

JOHANNA	Again?

JOHANNA / CASSIE / KALEY HELP!!!!

JOHANNA	Oh! Grab the rebar.

KALEY	What?

JOHANNA	That piece of metal.

CASSIE	A lever!

JOHANNA	Exactly.

JOHANNA	Just shove it under the concrete. Don't stab me.

KALEY	We can't do this. We need to get help.

JOHANNA	There's no time for that the building could collapse.

JOHANNA	Look girls, It's going to be okay.

JOHANNA	You just need to free my leg.

JOHANNA	Then we are just going to walk down the stairs and go outside.

JOHANNA	That's it. I need you to stay calm for your sister.

JOHANNA	Girls, this is no problem.

JOHANNA	When I was climbing in Nepal, my buddy got her arm

JOHANNA	clean cut off in an avalanche!

JOHANNA	I had to carry her down a mountain.

JOHANNA	But we got to a hospital and they reattached her

JOHANNA	arm and she was fine.

JOHANNA	That was a mountain. We just have to go down

JOHANNA	a few sets of stairs.

CASSIE	You carried her arm too?

JOHANNA	No. She carried that in her other hand.

CASSIE	Cool!

JOHANNA	Come on.

JOHANNA	Wait!

JOHANNA	When you lift that up there might be more blood.

JOHANNA	I'm going to need a bandage.

KALEY	We don't have any bandages.

JOHANNA	Kaley, I'm going to need you to rip your sleeve off.

KALEY	No! I just got this! Why can't it be hers or something.

JOHANNA	Sorry.

KALEY	[ scoffs ]

KALEY	[ grunts ] It won't work.

JOHANNA	You're just gonna have to take it off and use both hands.

KALEY	I don't have anything on underneath.

JOHANNA	Kaley. Look. We're just gonna look away. Right, Cassie?

KALEY	Can I get some light?

KALEY	Here.

JOHANNA	Thank you, Kaley.

JOHANNA	Okay.

KALEY	Come on, Cassie.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	[ groan ]

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Geez.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Is everyone alright?

NOAH	I think my arm is broken.

NOAH	Or maybe not.

NOAH	[grunts ]

DR. PIOCIOTTO	We need to reboot. We've got to see what happened.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	The network is counting us to relay data.

RAJESH	The Space Station feed comes directly into the antenna.

RAJESH	That might work.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Oh my god.

MATT	Hey. Thank you.

RODNEY	Oh. No, no. No problem at all.

MATT	Hell of a quake, huh?

RODNEY	That had to be a 9.

RODNEY	I've never felt anything like that.

MATT	I wonder if it hit this city.

RODNEY	That's a good question.

RODNEY	I got some spare pants in here. I think you could use these.

MATT	Thanks.

GIANELLI	Hello there.

JOHANNA	Are you alright, sir?

GIANELLI	Sir?

GIANELLI	My name is Roberto Gianelli.

GIANELLI	Sir is what you call old men.

GIANELLI	I don't look old to you, do I?

GIANELLI	That's all right, miss.

GIANELLI	You got to be 90 before year old, right?

GIANELLI	A little bit to go yet, huh?

GIANELLI	[ nervous chuckle ] 

GIANELLI	Well, isn't this a site to behold.

GIANELLI	Five angels descending from heaven.

GIANELLI	Yeah.

JOHANNA	What are you doing here, Mr. Gianelli?

JOHANNA	We should be getting out of the building.

GIANELLI	[ grunts ]  Right you are. That's for sure.

GIANELLI	I got out of my apartment okay.

GIANELLI	I got in the stairwell and all I can tell you-

GIANELLI	I --

GIANELLI	I couldn't make it down the stairs,

GIANELLI	so I thought I'd just take a rest.

GIANELLI	[ sniffs ]

AURORA	Come on, Mr. Gianelli.

AURORA	We gotta get out of here before this whole place collapses.

GIANELLI	I heard on the news on my little radio

GIANELLI	before the battery went dead.

GIANELLI	They were saying that this might just be a foreshock.

GIANELLI	That the whole city could collapse.

GIANELLI	They were talking about maybe tidal waves even.

JOHANNA	It's okay. It's okay, Cassie. We're almost down.

GIANELLI	Hey. Hey.

GIANELLI	Don't you worry, little Miss.

GIANELLI	We'll be out of here in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

GIANELLI	Okay. I guarantee ya.

GIANELLI	Come on. Let's go.

KALEY	Great. Now, what do we do?

CASSIE	Try the phone again.

JOHANNA	Wait. Turn off your flashlight for second.

CASSIE	What's going on?

AURORA	Look. We're there.

JOHANNA	We just need to get this out of the way

JOHANNA	Nice guns!

JOHANNA	You ever do martial arts?

MAY	Took a Krav Maga intro once. That's about it.

JOHANNA	I teach jujitsu, if you ever want to try

JOHANNA	something different.

KALEY	It's the end of the world and your marketing?

JOHANNA	[ grunts ]

JOHANNA	Cassie! Kaley!

CASSIE	It's okay. I'm through. It's not that far.	

CASSIE	Come on.

CASSIE	We're almost there.

GIANELLI	Well, I've been through smaller foxhole then that. [ chuckles ]

GIANELLI	Of course that was sixty years ago.

JOHANNA	We'll get you through, Roberto.

JOHANNA	I'll pull, you push.

MAY	Be careful.

AURORA	Come on.

JOHANNA	[ screaming ]

MAY	Aurora!

RODNEY	Hey. Here you go.

MATT	Alright.

RODNEY	Rodney Jackson.

MATT	Matt. Matt Mason. This is my son, Ricky.

RICK	You saved our lives.

RODNEY	No, no, no.

RODNEY	Your dad here saved your life.

RODNEY	I just lend a hand.

MATT	No, he's right. We owe you.

RODNEY	Well, hey wouldn't turn down a ride. A tree landed on my car.

RODNEY	I was walking out when I heard you shout.

MATT	You got it. And anything else you need.

RODNEY	Well, I appreciate that.

RODNEY	The roads are pretty smashed up.

RODNEY	You got four wheel drive?

MATT	Oh yeah, we do.

MATT	Oh yeah. [ chuckles ]

RODNEY	Yeah? You got four wheel drive? Alright!

RODNEY	Alright.

JOHANNA	We got to go.

JOHANNA	May, we have to go! 

MAY	Go on, I'll catch up.

JOHANNA	May!

MAY	I'll be right there.

GIANELLI	Leave her be, Miss. She just needs a minute.

CASSIE	Come on, Johanna.

JOHANNA / CASSIE / KALEY	MAY!

NOAH	[ grunts ] Hurry up.

NOAH	So dark matter passes through the planet, leaves a hole,

NOAH	but no explosion?

RAJESH	It doesn't really make any sense.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Not now. But once we study the telemetry we

DR. PIOCIOTTO	might understand it.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	And learn a lot about gravity and the nature of the universe,

DR. PIOCIOTTO	in the process.

NOAH	It's like a bullet that passes through jello.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Except that the Earth has a warm melty center.

RAJESH	More like a creme egg?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	And now the "creme" is filling in the hole.

NOAH	That's good, right?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	It's the heat of all that deep core magma that worries me.

RAJESH	Look at that!

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Give me an estimate on the wave height!

DR. PIOCIOTTO	This is Dr. Picciotto at Arecibo.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	We're tracking a mega tsunami radiating from

DR. PIOCIOTTO	the Arctic south through the Pacific.

RAJESH	It's over one hundred feet.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Estimated wave height at leastone hundred feet.

NOAH	My god, it can take out the whole Pacific Coast.

JOHANNA	Duck. Duck.

CASSIE	She could have gotten out.

GIANELLI	She's with her friend now.

KALEY	Friend? You mean wife, don't ya?

GIANELLI	I guess so.

JOHANNA	We need to get you girls someplace safe.

KALEY	What? No. Dad said if we ever got separated in an emergency,

KALEY	to meet at home.

JOHANNA	Matt's not here. And our home is gone.

KALEY	Well if we stay where we can see it,

KALEY	when he comes home we'll see him.

CASSIE	Do you think there was an earthquake in the mountains too?

JOHANNA	I don't know.

JOHANNA	But maybe we should get it out of the city.

JOHANNA	The cops won't be able to handle this.

GIANELLI	Yeah, you got That right. Once people get it into their minds

GIANELLI	they can get away with something.

JOHANNA	Even food and water will be scarce.

KALEY	No. No! We are staying here.

KALEY	[ groans ]

JOHANNA	Come on. Let's go.

KALEY	No! We have to stay here.

KALEY	I wish I had that stupid walkie-talkie dad bought me.

JOHANNA	That's right. Matt has that old shortwave in the Humvee.

JOHANNA	If we could find a HAM radio--

KALEY	There's an electronic store up the street.

JOHANNA	There is? 

JOHANNA	Can you show me, girls?

JOHANNA	Alright. Quickly. Go. Okay.

JOHANNA	Come on.

MATT	Hey, call your--Johanna.

RICK	My phone was in the tent.

MATT	Dammit. So was mine.

RODNEY	Here you go.

RICK	I don't know her number.

RICK	What? It was in the memory.

MATT	3-1-0-2-2-6-- 

RICK	It doesn't matter. No service.

MATT	Alright. Try an emergency band.

RADIO NEWSCASTER	[ radio ] An earthquake measuring 9.2 on the

RADIO NEWSCASTER	Richter scale has hit Los Angeles.

RADIO NEWSCASTER	There has been scattered reports from other countries indicating

RADIO NEWSCASTER	this maybe a global disaster.

RADIO NEWSCASTER	Blackouts blanket the LA area and we're getting unconfirmed

RADIO NEWSCASTER	reports of a large scale movement.

RADIO NEWSCASTER	Authorities are warning residents to shelter in

RADIO NEWSCASTER	place and to avoid large cities.

RADIO NEWSCASTER	HAM radios are reporting that a meteor may have struck Alaska.

RADIO NEWSCASTER	But we have no confirmation of that. Again, avoid--

RICK	Maybe we should stay appear.

RODNEY	No. I don't think this mountain

RODNEY	is completely stable.

MATT	Look. Doesn't matter. We gotta get back to the girls. Alright?

MATT	Try this shortwave- shortwave band.

RADIO NEWSCASTER	[ radio ] And that's what I've been saying all these years. 

RADIO NEWSCASTER	Something like this was going to happen and civilization

RADIO NEWSCASTER	would be over just like that.

RICK	Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

RICK	Does anybody know what's happened?

RADIO NEWSCASTER	[ radio ] And now, just wait, the government will declare

RADIO NEWSCASTER	Marshall Law and start rounding us up. You'll see.

MATT	Try 2160.

RICK	Okay.

RICK	Here.

MATT	W9GFO. W9GFO. This is W7THX, do you read me?

RICK	No way she's remember her call sign.

MATT	Kaley Mason, this is dad. Do you read me?

RODNEY	Maybe when we get out of the forest.

RADIO VOICES	[ radio static/voice breaking ] Mayday. Can anyone there?...

RADIO VOICES	Can anybody hear me?

RADIO VOICES	[ radio static/voice breaking ]

RICK	Dad, look out!

RODNEY	It's like the entire city and evacuated at once.

MATT	Oh god.

MATT	W9GFO. Johanna. Kaylee. It's Matt, do you hear me?

MATT	We're never going to get home this way.

RODNEY	Oh, no, no, no.

RODNEY	We got to get down.

RODNEY	I was studying this mountain. I am a geologist at Cal Tech.

RODNEY	If it keeps shaking we could be in real trouble here.

RICK	A back road, maybe?

MATT	Good work, son. Which way?

RICK	There.

KALEY	Johanna, come on.

KALEY	The electronic store is right up here.

JOHANNA	I got to get you girls out of this.

JOHANNA	Come on.

CASSIE	Doesn't this make us looters too?

JOHANNA	We'll come back and pay for them tomorrow.

GIANELLI	Maybe we should go around back?

JOHANNA	Go! Go! 

JOHANNA	Come on. We gotta go.

JOHANNA	Come on.

CASSIE	It's right up there.

KALEY	[ grunts ]

KALEY	Ugh! Now what?

GIANELLI	Any of you gotta paperclip or a hair pin?

GIANELLI	Or something like that?

GIANELLI	Yeah.

GIANELLI	There we go.

GIANELLI	Alright. 

GIANELLI	Look out. Look out.

GIANELLI	Step aside.

GIANELLI	Alright. 

GIANELLI	Okay.

GIANELLI	[ laughing ]

GIANELLI	I wasn't always an old man, you know. [ laughs ]

GIANELLI	Go on. After you.

GIANELLI	[ chuckles ]

GIANELLI	Alright.

RODNEY	Guys, I have a really bad feeling about this.

RODNEY	Drive faster.

CASSIE	Hmm. It says you need a license.

KALEY	Yeah, I have one.

KALEY	This is W9GFO calling W7THX, over.

JOHANNA	I'm impressed.

KALEY	Yeah. Well, passing that stupid test was one of the last thing

KALEY	I did with my mom.

KALEY	W7THX, do you read?

KALEY	Dad?

JOHANNA	Maybe we can try from up there.

MATT	It's gonna be alright.

KALEY	[ radio ] This is W9GFO calling Matt Mason, W7THX, over!

MATT	Kaley?! Is that you?

MATT	Dad!

MILITIA MAN	It's a nice vehicle you got there.

MILITIA MAN	We're gonna need it.

MATT	Alright. Stay in the car.

MATT	No matter what.

MILITIA MAN	You two, out!

MATT	(nervous)  Hey. I'm Matt.

MATT	That's my son Rick and that's Rodney.

MILITIA MAN	Yeah. I don't care about introductions.

MILITIA MAN	I said, get out of the vehicle!

MATT	Hey look, we got a winch in there.

MATT	Maybe we could help you. We'd be happy to pull

MATT	your truck out the ditch.

OLIVER	He radiator's busted. Have you got--

MILITIA MAN	That truck ain't going anywhere, Oliver.

MILITIA MAN	We're taking yours.

MILITIA MAN	Stop!

MILITIA MAN	Stop!

MILITIA MAN	I said, you two out of the car!

RICK	Dad.

RODNEY	Your dad knows what he's doing.

RICK	It doesn't seem like it.

MATT	Come on, man. I'm just trying to get my kid back to the city.

MATT	Back to his mom and my daughters.

MATT	We could take you with us.

MILITIA MAN	No. There's not enough room.

MILITIA MAN	Besides, you're a fool if you go back to the city.

MILITIA WOMAN	Maybe they can come with us. 

MILITIA MAN	Shut up!

OLIVER	We just need to rendezvous with the--

MILITIA MAN	Shut up, Oliver!

MATT	Come on. Please.

ALL	[ screams ]

MILITIA MAN	[ grunts ]

RODNEY	[ gasp ] Oh.

RICK	What are you doing?

RICK	Dad?

RICK	Dad, no.

MATT	It's the right thing to do.

RODNEY	Let's go.

RICK	This is just like HER!

RICK	You have to put your children first!

MATT	Drop the guns.

MATT	Come on. Get in! Just leave the guns.

OLIVER	Thank you so much!

OLIVER	The name's Oliver. Come on.

MATT	Come on.  Hurry up.

MATT	Kaley! You there?!

MATT	Alright. Where's this other truck of yours?

RADIO VOICE	[ indistinct dialogue over radio ]

KALEY	Dad, are you there?!

KALEY	W7THX this is W9GFO, do you read me?!

JOHANNA	That's it, Mr. Gianelli.

JOHANNA	You're almost there.

JOHANNA	You're doing great.

JOHANNA	Did you reach him?

KALEY	Not yet!

JOHANNA	It's okay, honey.

JOHANNA	You're in the line of sight.

JOHANNA	Are you sure you're on the right frequency?

RADIO VOICE	[ indistinct dialogue over radio ]

KALEY	It's Kaley, dad. Over.

GIANELLI	Oy vey. I shouldn't have quit my Zumba class. [ laughs ]

JOHANNA	Mr. Gianelli, I'll do Zumba with you any time!

GIANELLI	[coughing]

GIANELLI	You should go with your daughters. I'm fine. Go.

JOHANNA	They're not actually my daughters.

GIANELLI	Aren't they?

GIANELLI	Eh?

GIANELLI	Go on.

KALEY	Anyone?

JOHANNA	Can you make reservations to Club Med on that thing?

JOHANNA	I think we're all going to need a vacation after this.

CASSIE	How about Disney World?

KALEY	[ scoff ] Dork.

KALEY	Look around. Disney World's toast.

JOHANNA	Kaley!

KALEY	What? People are talking about it. It's happening

KALEY	all over the world.

KALEY	Earth was hit by a meteor or something.

CASSIE	Everywhere?!

JOHANNA	Not everywhere, Cassie.

JOHANNA	We know your dad's fine. We just heard from him.

JOHANNA	Try again.

MATT	W9GFO, this is W7THX.

MATT	Kaley, do you read me?

CASSIE	It's dad!

KALEY	Dad! Dad, are you okay?!

KALEY	Is Ricky?!

MATT	Don't worry. We're okay.	

MATT	Are you with your sister?

MATT	Is Johanna with you?

KALEY	Yeah. Yeah. We're all together, but the building collapsed.

MATT	You say the building collapsed?! Everybody's okay? No one's hurt?

JOHANNA	Matt. Matt. We're all together. We're fine. Where are you?

MATT	[ indistinguishable dialogue on radio ]

JOHANNA	Matt, the city is not safe.

JOHANNA	There's a lot of of rubble and people are getting

JOHANNA	out of control.

JOHANNA	I need to get these girls someplace safe.

MATT	[  transmission breaking ] Say again? Where safe?

JOHANNA	Matt, where are you?

JOHANNA	Matt, are you there?!

KALEY	W7THX, this is Kaley, over.

JOHANNA	We know where he is.

JOHANNA	He's coming down Route 38.

JOHANNA	Okay. We'll just have to head that way.

JOHANNA	Come on.

KALEY	No! No! Dad said to meet at home!

JOHANNA	We couldn't hear what he said.

CASSIE	Johanna? Isn't the car, under like a million tons of rubble?

CASSIE	How could we go anywhere anyhow?

JOHANNA	Maybe we could find some bicycles.

RAJESH	I wish there was something more we could do.

NOAH	Tsunami warnings are being activated.

NOAH	The USGS is monitoring the seismic quakes.

NOAH	The U.S. military is getting it's act together to

NOAH	start relief operations.

NOAH	We're just an observatory. We're observing.

RAJESH	I know. I said I wish there was more we could do.

RAJESH	So many people must be dying today.

NOAH	So how does someone end up with the name Rajesh Vasquez?

NOAH	Was your mother Indian and your dad Mexican?

RAJESH	Yeah.

NOAH	Oh.

RAJESH	How does someone of Chinese descent,

RAJESH	I'm guessing from around the Shandong province,

RAJESH	end up with the name like Noah Smith?

NOAH	Noah Smith is a very traditional Chinese name.

NOAH	I was adopted. And it was the Jiangsu province.

RAJESH	Oh. Okay.

RAJESH	Okay.

NOAH	I'm glad we cleared that up.

RAJESH	Me too.

NOAH	Oh!

DR. PIOCIOTTO	What's going on?

NOAH	The weather satellites are going crazy!

RAJESH	Looks like the superheated air created by

RAJESH	the magma filling in the hole is negatively charged.

RAJESH	It's spin is creating static discharges in the thermosphere.

NOAH	What does that mean?

DR. PIOCIOTTO	The mother of all electrical storms.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Send this to the Pentagon.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	The same thing's happening on the other side of the world

DR. PIOCIOTTO	with a positive charge.

OLIVER	Our rendezvous with the rest of our group is about a mile ahead.

MATT	Alright, I'm not going to have trouble with this guy, am I?

OLIVER	You saved our lives when you had no reason to.

OLIVER	You seem to know what you're doing, and I'm guessing

OLIVER	this vehicle can go anywhere and do anything.

OLIVER	You'd be welcome to join us. All three of you.

OLIVER	We've got a bunker in the desert. It used to be

OLIVER	an old missile silo.

OLIVER	We've got weapons, and food and water to last years.

MATT	Nah. I've got to get back to my family. Thanks.

OLIVER	Well, the offer stands.

OLIVER	Bring your family.

RODNEY	I'll come with you.

RODNEY	What we're hearing happened actually happened,

RODNEY	things are gonna get a lot worse before

RODNEY	they get any better.

RODNEY	Earthquakes and volcanoes all over the world.

RODNEY	That's a lot of ash and dust in the sky.

RODNEY	Which can cause a nuclear winter.

RODNEY	Plus the power grids are down.

RODNEY	It could take years to get electricity restored everywhere.

RODNEY	And you just know some fool is going to use us to start a war.

RODNEY	I think a bunker--

RODNEY	a bunker in the desert sounds like a good idea.

RODNEY	There's no telling what will happen next.

MATT	What the hell is that?

MATT	That can't be good.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	It looks like it's only hitting the surface at volcanic events.

RAJESH	Some kind of current flow through the mantle?

RAJESH	I've lost telemetry!

NOAH	Me too.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	It's frying our satellites! Damn!

CASSIE	Is that Dad's mountain?

JOHANNA	Of course not, honey.

JOHANNA	Don't worry about your dad. He knows what he's doing.

JOHANNA	We've got to get off this roof.

CASSIE	But we can see where our building was from here.

CASSIE	We'll be able to tell when dad gets back.

JOHANNA	We at least need to get you undercover. Come on.

JOHANNA	Girls, we can't stay here. The city is the worst place

JOHANNA	to be in a disaster.

JOHANNA	There are too many people. People who are desperate. Okay?

JOHANNA	You, Kaley, you know what can happens

JOHANNA	when people lose control, right?

KALEY	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

KALEY	But we need to meet up with dad.

JOHANNA	And we will. We just need to move closer were the

JOHANNA	radio reception is better.

JOHANNA	We have to keep moving there. Closer to him.

JOHANNA	Matt! Matt Mason!

JOHANNA	Are you there?!

KALEY	W7... I can't! Dad! It's Kaley, over!

TRUCK DRIVER	What happened?

TRUCK DRIVER	Where's your truck?

OLIVER	Long story. This is Matt and his son Rick, and Rodney.

OLIVER	They saved us from the lava.

TRUCK DRIVER	Lava?!

OLIVER	Yeah. It's coming this way.

MATT	We gotta go.

OLIVER	Rodney's joining us. I've invited Matt and his family too.

TRUCK DRIVER	Okay. Everyone's in the back.

TRUCK DRIVER	What the hell happened to him?

MATT	Same long story.

OLIVER	If you find your family, we'll be monitoring 3.4 megahertz.

MATT	Thank you.

OLIVER	No, thank you!

OLIVER	Let's go!

RODNEY	Good luck! Keep your heads down!

MATT	Alright. you too.

RICK	Thanks for saving our lives, Rodney!	

RODNEY	Anytime.

MATT	Come on.

MATT	W9GFO, are you there?

RICK	How are we going to get to the girls?

MATT	You remember what I told you to do in case of an emergency?

RICK	Meet at home!

MATT	I'm sure they remember too.

RICK	Okay.

MATT	No one can protect them like Johanna can. She's fierce.

RICK	Fierce is good?

MATT	Fierce is very good.

MATT	-Oh Sh--

CASSIE	No!

JOHANNA	It's okay, Cassie. It's okay.

JOHANNA	Your dad was coming down a long time ago. He's fine.

CASSIE	You said that wasn't even his mountain.

KALEY	Of course that's the mountain! You've been there!

JOHANNA	Kaley!

KALEY	She's just trying to protect you!

KALEY	She's always trying to protect you!

KALEY	Why is she the one you're always protecting and never me?!

KALEY	The minute you came into our lives, it was always her!

JOHANNA	I was just treating you like an adult.

JOHANNA	I thought that's what you wanted.

KALEY	You knew I was out last night,

KALEY	and you didn't even care.

KALEY	You haven't said anything!

KALEY	You know, I wish Dad never married you!

JOHANNA	I thought...

JOHANNA	I--

JOHANNA	I was just trying to be your friend, Kaley.

JOHANNA	Not judge you.

JOHANNA	Look. I knew that I could never be your mother,

JOHANNA	so I was just trying to be your friend.

KALEY	No. No! Don't you get it?

KALEY	I NEED A MOM!

KALEY	Especially now. 

KALEY	I don't have a dad.

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	This is the emergency alert system.

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	This is not a test. Following a Celestial impact

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	in northern Alaska,

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	A catastrophic Tsunami warning has been issued for the entire

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	West Coast of the United States.

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	A wave exceeding 100 feet in height may inundate coastal

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	areas as far inland as 30 miles.

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	The Pacific Northwest should expect imminent landfall.

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	Southern California including Los Angeles should expect

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	the wave within 30 minutes.

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	Residents are urged to seek high ground immediately.

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	This has been the emergency alert system.

EMERGENCY ALERT VOICE	This is not a test.

CASSIE	What do we do?

KALEY	I mean, even if we had a car, the freeways will be jammed!

JOHANNA	Everywhere will be jammed.

CASSIE	If we leave, how will we find dad?

JOHANNA	There's no time for that, Cassie.

JOHANNA	If we stay here, we die.

JOHANNA	If we could get to the airport or find a helicopter.

GIANELLI	Ladies.

CASSIE	Can you fly, too?

GIANELLI	Ladies!

GIANELLI	Perhaps this is your solution?

GIANELLI	Huh?

GIANELLI	[ chuckle ]

JOHANNA	Yes! 

GIANELLI	Eh.

JOHANNA	Alright. Come on, girls. We got to get down.

JOHANNA	W7THX, this is W9GFO, transmitting in the clear.

JOHANNA	Matt, there's a tsunami heading towards Los Angeles.

JOHANNA	We're bugging out.

JOHANNA	Meet us in the hills where we had our third date!

JOHANNA	I repeat, meet us in the hills where we first...

JOHANNA	had a picnic. W9GFO out.

JOHANNA	Mr. Gianelli, come on!

GIANELLI	Hold on, hold on, hold on.

GIANELLI	Before you start.

GIANELLI	I am not gonna be able to ride a motorcycle through the city

GIANELLI	on the brink of chaos.

GIANELLI	Let alone slow in the driveway.

GIANELLI	And I'm certainly not going to be able to make it

GIANELLI	down that ladder.

JOHANNA	I'll help you.

GIANELLI	I'll slow you down.

JOHANNA	But--

GIANELLI	[ sigh ] Listen.	

GIANELLI	You've got those two girls to take care of.

GIANELLI	So, don't you worry about me.

GIANELLI	You'll die.

KALEY	Hey! What's going on?

GIANELLI	Listen to me. I'ma be just fine. Okay?

GIANELLI	I thank you very much for getting me out

GIANELLI	of the dark stairwell.

GIANELLI	I think it's better to have the sun on my face, huh?

KALEY	Come on!

JOHANNA	[ sniffs ]

GIANELLI	Go on.

JOHANNA	[ kiss ]

GIANELLI	I think that's pretty well worth it! [ chuckle ]

KALEY	What about him?

JOHANNA	Cassie, come with me.

JOHANNA	Kaley, it's like that time we did motocross.

JOHANNA	It's not that different from your scooter.

KALEY	Yeah. Don't worry, I got this.

BIKER	You're too late.

JOHANNA	Those your bikes?

BIKER	They are now.

BIKER	Forget about it, Honey.

BIKER	I'm taking the other one to my buddy.

JOHANNA	Maybe we could work something out?

JOHANNA	Come along with you.

JOHANNA	Keep you company.

BIKER	Just you.

BIKER	Don't need no kids slowing me down.

BIKER	And you'd better be good company too.

JOHANNA / BIKER	[ grunts/efforts ]

BIKER	[ grunt ]

JOHANNA	Come on!

KALEY	Oh my god!

KALEY	You're like Wonder Woman!

JOHANNA	Okay.

JOHANNA	We got to get out of this traffic,

JOHANNA	get up into the hills.

JOHANNA	Let's try the freeway.

JOHANNA	Come on.

KALEY	Go. Go! Come on, hurry!

KALEY	Let's go.

JOHANNA	Come on. Almost there.

JOHANNA	Go. [ groan ]	

JOHANNA	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

CASSIE	Mommy!

KALEY	Try the radio again.

JOHANNA	It must have fallen out somewhere.

KALEY	Dad.

CASSIE / KALEY	Dad! DAD!

KALEY	Come on, Cassie!

KALEY	Ricky!

CASSIE	I miss you guys so much.

MATT	[ relief chuckle ]

RICK	You saved them.

JOHANNA	We saved each other.

KALEY	Okay.

RICK	Oh my god!

RAJESH	Is anyone else seeing this?

RAJESH	All the weather stations north of L.A. are going crazy.

RAJESH	And then just going dead.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	My god.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	The magma plug in the hole must have collapsed.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	It's created a vortex that's sucking in the atmosphere.

NOAH	It's expanding exponentially.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	The Coriolis effect should dissipate it once it

DR. PIOCIOTTO	expands to the equator.

RAJESH	Okay.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	But first it will scour every sign of life from the face

DR. PIOCIOTTO	of North America.

MATT	Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Go.

MATT	Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

MATT	Go, go, go, go. Come on! Get in.

JOHANNA	Where are we going?

MATT	The desert!

JOHANNA	We can't outrun that thing for long!

MATT	We don't need long!

MATT	We met some friends.

JOHANNA	Are you sure you know where you're going?

MATT	Yeah. I got it! I got it!

JOHANNA	Are you sure, Matt?

MATT	I got it!

JOHANNA	What is this place?

RICK	Alright. Just a little bit further and we should be good.

RICK	Come on. Come on! 

JOHANNA	Come on! Come on!

JOHANNA	Come on!

RICK	Come on!

MATT	How we doing over there?

JOHANNA	What are we looking for?

KALEY	It's okay. It's okay. 

JOHANNA	Matt, what are We looking for?

JOHANNA	MATT!!

MATT	Just hang on girls. I'll be okay. Okay?

RICK	This is the place. It's got to be here.

KALEY	It's okay. 

MATT	Over there. I think that's it.

JOHANNA	Faster!

MATT	Almost there.

KALEY	Dad! Go! Go!

KALEY	I mean it!

MATT	Almost there! Almost there!

JOHANNA	Almost where?

MATT	Rick?

RICK	Sanctuary, Sanctuary, the Masons are inbound!

JOHANNA	Where are you taking us?

MATT	You wouldn't believe me

MATT	if I told ya.

MATT	I love you guys.

JOHANNA	I missed you guys.

MATT	Good work, Ricky.

RICK	I love you, dad.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Gentlemen, how's that report coming?

RAJESH	There's so much data from that day, we're still collating.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Well, what can you tell me about dark matter now that

DR. PIOCIOTTO	we didn't know a year ago?

NOAH	Uh, It's really bad.

DR. PIOCIOTTO	Keep up the good work!

RODNEY	The latest seismographs show the faults have stabilized.

RODNEY	With the pressure released, we won't see another earthquake

RODNEY	for a hundred years!

MATT	A hundred years. That's good news. [ laughs ]

OLIVER	We're able to start sending scouting teams into the city,

OLIVER	if you guys want to check on your home?

MATT	Thanks. We'll let you know.

MATT	Alright.

MATT	What do you think? You wanna go home?

KALEY	Everything we've ever known is gone.

RICK	Yeah. I mean, I know it was just a year ago,

RICK	but it feels like a whole other world.

CASSIE	I kinda like being a country girl.

JOHANNA	[ laughing ]

MATT	What do you think Jo? You want to go back to the city?

JOHANNA	[ exhale ]

JOHANNA	It doesn't really matter where we go.

JOHANNA	So long as we do it as a family.

JOHANNA / KALEY / CASSIE	[ giggling ]

MATT	[ kiss ]
