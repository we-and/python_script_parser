(SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT)
("#HOWTOMAKELOVETOANEGROWITH OUTGETTINGTIRED")
(Episode #107 Theme: FIRST DATES)



GREER	Sometimes being this Good Looking can be a burden. Oh yeah. But I’m used to it. Nola and I met a year ago. I saw her eyeing me, and she wasn't even interested. And that was a big Turn On. And I’ve been Turning her out ever since. As Nola likes to say, we are Fuck Buddies and with that comes Fuck Buddy Codes. She has her Rules. We don’t really Hang Out. We can't say we're exclusive but that's about to change. Last night, at the gallery, I saw a different side of Nola Darling. Now I see more than just her Body. I see the Woman inside. I saw Nola in her World. A Woman in her Element, Self- Possessed. She is Special. Hey, it’s one thing Fucking her in her Lovin’ Bed, but it’s another being in the Real World together. I know she's got those Dudes she hangs with. Them Punk-Ass were probably orbiting around her show last night. But I didn’t see any competition, except for maybe that Woman, Opal. Okay, you got me. I’m not used to working this hard. But, I’m up for the challenge. People, I came out of my dear mother's womb ready. Why wouldn’t she want to be with me? I am a great Fucking Catch. That's it, Today I’m breaking those Rules.
 
NOLA	Okay. Ahh, get out.

JULIUS KEMPER	I am bursting with excitement. I want to howl like a wolf. Woooo! An outstanding Group Show curated by the talented Clorinda Bradford opened last night at the New  Medina Gallery in Dumbo. First, of course, we have to Haitian sensation Baptiste, who's meaty texture black on black eliminates the need for change in line and contour by bathing the eye in the infinity that is found in total blackness.

NOLA	Blah blah blah blah blah..

JULIUS KEMPER	Zora Kneel Hurtin subverts pop art...

NOLA	Enough already.

JULIUS KEMPER	...by re-purposing Madam C.J Walker's hot comb iron and thus set's fire to the items that shackles the souls of black folk. Lemuel Richards excretes blackness in every stroke of his pen. You don't get it? He doesn't give a fuck! (indistinct) And that brings me to the problem of the show and it's weakest link, Nola Darling. And that brings me to the problem of the show and it's weakest link, Nola Darling. You heard right the first time. You, Nola Darling, are The Weakest Link. Ms. Darling’s Work is almost out of place and overshadowed by the fierce Trifecta of African-American Artists. Her selection of Work is pedestrian when compared to the electrifying political perspectives of her piers.
 
NOLA	Fast forward.

JULIUS KEMPER	Stop fast-forwarding. Now I had the opportunity to talk with Miss Darling about her selection of works which she has presumptively entitled “The Free Female Black Form” and she was decidedly unable to articulate its meaning in any cohesive manner.

NOLA	Fuck!

JULIUS KEMPER	And is there any surprise in that? How can one encapsulate the Free Female Black Form? To her credit, Miss. Darling has ample facility. It’s certainly not a question of Talent or Skill. Not by any means.

NOLA	Oh, Thanks.

JULIUS KEMPER	Perhaps her Artistic Eyes were just bigger than her Stomach. Let’s be frank, not quite working with the same intensity as her Diastopian peers and with no unifying principles, Ms. Darlings’ selection of Work is Disparate, Disjointed, Diluted and dysfunctional. I don’t want to know who Ms. Darling is inspired by, I want to know who she is.

NOLA	Fuck you Julius Kemper. Shit!

GREER	Bonjour, Mademoiselle Nola, C’est moi, Greer. Cherie, Felicitations! Call me back.
 
SEPTIMA	Ladybug, this is Mommy and Daddy calling. We are so proud of you. Your Father's making your favorite Greasy breakfast. Some salmon croquettes, some grits and potatoes. Stop by.

JAMIE	Nola, I hope my presence was a pleasant surprise. I promise it won’t be the last. Hit me back.

GREER	Nola, Cherie, Call me back.

OPAL & SKYLAR	Money is coming! Money is coming!

MARS	Yo,yo,yo, Nola. What up? Yo, I ain’t Mad at you for not inviting me. I hope you ain’t mad at the Kid for standing up for his Femme Fatale, alright? On the sincerious tip, how about a make up Call? Love from the planet Mars.

JAMIE	Come in.

CHERYL	How are you?

JAMIE	Fine. You?

CHERYL	Fine.

JAMIE	Must be important for you to walk all the way down here, in my dungeon.
 
CHERYL	In fact, it's very important. Virgil wants to play us something.

JAMIE	How is our son doing?

CHERYL	Great. But you need to ask him yourself.

JAMIE	Yeah.

CHERYL	Bravo! Come here, give me a kiss. Where did that come from?

VIRGIL	It came from that stupid Video I was in. I thought about who I am and what this Country is all about. I did some research and found out Francis Scott Key wrote a Mad Racist Verse endorsing Slavery so all this time you've been singing this National Anthem about our 246 Years of Enslavement, not to end it but to continue it.

CHERYL	Virgil, I didn’t know this.

JAMIE	Me neither.

VIRGIL	Google.

JAMIE	Alright, we'll be up soon. That was great.

VIRGIL	Thank you.

JAMIE	Love you.
 
VIRGIL	Love you too.

CHERYL	That's our best work.

JAMIE	Yeah.

MARS	Where is NoNo LaLa? LaNo? LaNo?

NOLA	Who is it? I can’t hear you!

GREER	It's the law!

NOLA	Stop ringing my bell, go away. Are you fucking kidding me? Go to hell! What The Fuck are you doing here Greer?

GREER	Somebody had a long night. You gonna let me in?

NOLA	No! No, I’m not gonna let you in and I do not appreciate you coming over here unannounced.

GREER	But if you would've answered my Calls or Texts.
 
NOLA	Boy Bye.

GREER	Baby, could you please open the door so I can talk to you?

NOLA	Did I not set the Rules? And didn't you not agree to those rules?

GREER	All you do is Break the Rules.

NOLA	Whatever. I’m not in the mood for a Booty- Call.

GREER	No, I’m not... I'm not here for your Lovin’ Bed. Let’s go out and celebrate your triumphant debut. How about Dinner? Go to a Film? Whatever you like. I just want to show you a nice time. Cinema. Okay, Old or New?

NOLA	Old. Shot in Black and White.

GREER	Okay, a Film it is. I’ll Text You.


NOLA	I did not commit to that. Come on, I don’t want to miss the previews.
 
MAN	Give me one of those.

PEOLA	Yes.

OLD MAN	What can I do for you?

BEA	Peola. We've been looking everywhere for you.

PEOLA	Are you talking to me? There must be some mistake. My name isn't Peola.

BEA	There ain't no mistake. Why have you got this job? You don't have to work. I'll give you everything you want.

PEOLA	What are you talking about? I'm sure you've got me confused with someone else.

BEA	Why, why Peola child! I'm your mammy!

PEOLA	Why, that's ridiculous! I never saw you before in my life!

OLD MAN	What's the meaning of this?
 
PEOLA	This woman doesn't know what she's talking about. Do I look like her daughter? Do I look like I could be her daughter? Why, she must be crazy!

GREER	You okay?

NOLA	Yeah, I’m fine.

GREER	You got that, I don't know, this “Je Ne Sais Quoi.” In fact, let me show you.

NOLA	Hum, I'm really...

GREER	Just get over here.

NOLA	That’s Sweet.

GREER	Bisou.

WOMAN #1	Greer, you lost my number?

WOMAN #2	I missed you.
 
WOMAN #3	How you doing?

WOMAN #4	Long time no see.

WOMAN #5	Greer!

WOMAN #6	Call me back.

WOMAN #7	Where have you been?

WOMAN #8	Mi amore, call me.

WOMAN #9	See you soon.

WOMAN #10	Hola.

LILY (subtitle)	Salut Greer! (Hello Greer!)

GREER (subtitle)	Salut Lily. (Hey Lily!)

LILY (subtitle)	Ça va ? (how are you?)

GREER (Subtitle)	Ça va bien. (Things are going well.)

LILY	Salut.
 
NOLA	Thank you.

GREER	Problem?

NOLA	Not mine

LILY	May I join you?

NOLA	Yes, please do

GREER	Nola, Lily, Lily, Nola.

LILY	You’re Beautiful!

NOLA	Thank you. So are you!

GREER (Subtitle)	Elle a eut son vernissage hier soir. Grand succes! On est là pour fêter ça. C'est une artiste incroyable. Toi et tes amis, vous devriez venir la voir. Tu devrait dire à Monsieur Benoît d'achetter quelques'un de ces tableaux et les acrocher au mur. Elle serra super connue. (She had her opening last night. It was a big success. We’re here to celebrate. She’s an amazing artist. You and your friends should come see her work. You should tell Mr. Benoît that he should buy a few of her paintings and hang them on the wall. She’s going to be huge.)

LILY	Congratulations!

NOLA	Thank you.

LILY	I’ll be back with your drink orders.

GREER	Thank you.
 
NOLA	So what, you think you're Guido from Fellini's Eight and a half? “So you got your Harem King Solomon.”

LILY (Subtitle)	Oh, c'est trop bon. (That's so good.)

NOLA (Subtitle)	Anyway, qu'est-ce qu'il y a à manger ? (What is there to eat?)

GREER (Subtitle)	Ou la la. Tu parles français maintenant ? (You speak French now?) You speak French now?

NOLA	Maybe.

GREER	The language of love. Your accent is so whack. It's cute, it's cute.

NOLA	Don't touch me.

GREER	I want you to try something of these Vegan Dishes. It’s my Cheat Day. This is Fennel Sausage. This is Aduki Bacon. It’s all Beans.

NOLA	That is really good. I’ve never had that before. I don’t mind Vegetarian but I’m an Omnivore.

GREER	Well I may be Vegetarian but I’m a Carnivore in your Loving Bed.

NOLA	You are a Cannibal in my Loving Bed.

GREER (Subtitle)	À ta Santé (Cheers) and Congratulations on your Show. Superbe. (Superb.)

NOLA	Thank you.

CHERYL	Parent Teacher conferences are next Thursday. Do you want to go or shall I?

JAMIE	As long as that White Liberal Asshole Headmaster is there.

CHERYL	That's fine, I'll go.

JAMIE	I'll go. It's not what I said, if he's not there...

CHERYL	No it's fine.

JAMIE	… I can go.

CHERYL	I'm happy to go.

JAMIE	I told my wife and my son that I would never leave them like my Father left my mother and I. I’m stuck. Love versus duty. Passion over security. I need Nola Darling, but my Family needs me more. There’s a Poetry in this dilemma. But it's a Poem that I wish I could write my way out of. Can I evolve. Give it all up for Nola? Or make it work with my beautiful wife Cheryl? Why did I buy this self-portrait? If only it were Nola herself in my bed. It might be the only thing about Nola I can afford. I grip it tight with the hand that wears our Wedding Ring. This Canvas is Cold. This Bed is colder. How can I spend another Cold Night alone?
 
GREER	That was quite a turnout last night. How do you think it went?

NOLA	It went well. I was in Good Company. It was a bit nerve- wracking at first. But, you know, I was Happy to be a part of it. Just wish one of my Pieces had Sold.

GREER	Quite a Scene. You know, I don't think I've ever seen you that way before. Would have been nice to get an invitation.

NOLA	It wasn’t about you. It was about my Work. Besides, you didn't seem that have any problems getting in.

GREER	I'm Greer Childs.

NOLA	What a Gift.

GREER	I bet your other Dudes were there. Did they get an invitation?

NOLA	Yes, She did. I don’t ask you about your other Women.

GREER	What do you want to know?

NOLA	I don’t.

GREER	That first time you sketched me, What did you see?
 
NOLA	Shapes, Colors, Lines, Contrasts, Shadows, Contours and... Negative space. Did I say you could sit down?

JAMIE	Do I need permission?

NOLA	Of course.

JAMIE	Excuse me Miss? May I sit next to you?

NOLA	I love that song. Jay-Z and Pharrell, right?

JAMIE	What do you know about Hov?

NOLA	I know he that Dude. Did you know Jay-Z mentions Rilke in “What they gonna do” from The Blueprint 2?

JAMIE	I have a Friend of a Friend, who knows Jay, who told me that one of his Dopest Tracks, “There’s Been a Murder,” was heavily influenced by Rilke’s “Death Experience.” You know that one?

NOLA	Nah. Spit a Few Bars.
 
JAMIE	Okay. We Continue Our Play, Picking up Gestures Now and Then, And Anxiously Reciting that Which Was Difficult to Learn, But You’re Far Away, So That For a While We Play Life Rapturously, Not Thinking of Any Applause. Rapturously. Rilke was definitely the Jay-Z of his Time.

NOLA	So I guess you like Poetry, or Whatever?

JAMIE	I Love Poetry.

JAMIE	My name is Jamie.

NOLA	Nola.

JAMIE	Pleased to meet you Nola.


NOLA	Likewise, Mr. Jamie.

JAMIE	Dayum. Mister Jamie? It’s like that?

NOLA	Yes like that, You’re Grown as Fuck.

JAMIE	I Love your Candor.

NOLA	I Love the fact that you just used the word Candor.

JAMIE	As opposed to keepin’ it One-Hundred?

NOLA	Oh my goodness. Everybody is saying Keep It One-Hundred. Like everybody.
 
JAMIE	Especially the White Hipsters trying to Lean and Dab around the pool at the Weekend Rooftop Parties at the Ganesvoort Park Avenue. It's a Cultural Black Card. Plus, they know all the words back to back.

NOLA	Of Course. Drake is a Cult.

JAMIE	No doubt Nola. But here’s the burning question.

NOLA	What's that?

JAMIE	Do you believe in Love at First Sight?

NOLA	In the film Love Jones, yes. Not so much in Real Life.

JAMIE	Nola, Jamie. Call me.

GREER	In France, you don’t enter the room wearing your Race on your sleeve like you do here. You know, you don’t have to chose. You can be both. So when I came here as a kid it was a difficult transition.
 
NOLA	So wait, what are you saying? There’s no Racism in France? Do you see how the French treat Africans and Muslims?

GREER	I know. It’s just more Binary in the U.S. Anyway so you’re mad about some Critic said that your Work is Pedestrian?

NOLA	Basically. I have no Clear vision and my Work didn’t fit in with the Theme of the Show. Not cohesive. Not Black enough.

GREER	You see, right there, a French Critic would never have that criticism. But, Cherie, you had very different pieces. Like, how did they actually connect?

NOLA	They just do.

GREER	Right. But I want to know how they connect.

NOLA	How do you say, ‘Check Please’ in French? Lily? Lily?

GREER	Actually your Work wasn’t like the other Artists. That’s what I Loved about it. Theirs was so Blackity- Black-Black, I’m so sick of that. And yours was... Nola’s Point of View. Fluid.

NOLA	Yes. Exactly. Thank you. This Guy thinks he’s the authority on Blackness. The Black Female Form.

GREER	I love your Form.
 
NOLA	Like he’s calling my Blackness into question. As if there’s some singular representation. Like I’m not Black enough.

GREER	Yes, I understand completely.

NOLA	So I get called out by this White Critic Asshole for not expressing his version of The Black Aesthetic. What the Fuck does he know?

GREER	See? Thank you! This is what I’m trying to say. We have s much in common. Like how I get criticized by Black people for not being Black enough. I feel like I’m always having to prove my identity and choose a side. And if I chose, what, what do I deny my white French Mother? Does that make me more black? What about my African-American Father? The Man was a Black Panther, for christ sake.

NOLA	It’s just fucked up. Commercially the space is dominated by White Folks. They’re The Gatekeepers. They get to decide what’s hot and what’s Not.

GREER	Can you feel how hard I am right now? But it’s Fucked up. I just want you to be resilient. I Love how you have the Courage to put your Work out there. I want the same for myself, you know. Commercial Photography is just disposable, you know. It's just appeasing the Clients.

NOLA	The Gatekeepers. What are your Artistic Aspirations?
 
GREER	I want my Work to be Immortal. Maybe do a Show. Put a Book out. You know, something personal.

NOLA	Why don’t you?

GREER	It takes courage. I guess I’m caught between wanting to move forward and wanting to have the stability of being able to Eat, keep a roof over my Head. I don’t want to lose my Net. I mean can't you see how I live?

NOLA	Sometimes you got to jump without the net. But, I can understand that. You know, that's that New York City Hustle.

GREER	Well, apparently not, if your Art's not Selling.

NOLA	You know, I was waiting for the Old Greer to rear it’s Ugly-Asshole head and there it is.

GREER	No no no, wait don't... Cherie, Stay. Sit. Relax.

CHERYL	What are you doing? Why are you in my Bathroom?

JAMIE	Can I join you? Please?

CHERYL	Shut the door.
 
GREER	You trying to... trick me?

LILY	Here's your coat.

GREER	Thank you...

LILY	Of course.

GREER	...For bringing this.

NOLA	What’s this? Really? Who are you today? This is pretty. That’s so sweet.

GREER	Do you remember?

NOLA	Of course I remember.

GREER	Yeah. I know the Title is a bit shocking but it’s actually a Novel. It's about these two young Black roommates, these Francophiles living in the slums of Montreal in the 1980’s. So good. One's a Writer and the other sleeps a lot and quotes the Qur’an and Camus. They don’t have to do much because all these White women just keep throwing themselves at them.

NOLA	There you go.

GREER	“Miss Nola”, I don’t want them, I want you. I want us to do this more. Go out on, movies, Dates. Together. What do you say?
 
NOLA	I say I... I can’t... do this right now.

GREER	Nola. Nola! Nola!

JOE	One more.

JAMIE	Thanks.

JOE	Madame.

CHERYL	Thank you.

JOE	Vodka Martini.

CHERYL	Thank you.

JOE	Please, allow me.

CHERYL	Oh, thank you.

JOE	Like it.

JAMIE	Alright.

JOE	Overstreet, that's the last one. Hey Mac, I'm calling you a cab.

JAMIE	I miss you, Nola. I miss you so much.
 
SHEMEKKA	Bitch, are you drunk?

NOLA	What?! No!

SHEMEKKA	Shhh, you're so loud. You look pretty.

NOLA	I feel like shit. You look like shit.

SHEMEKKA	Damn you bastard. Ow, ow, ouch.

NOLA	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

SHEMEKKA	I'm sorry.

NOLA	I'm sorry too.

SHEMEKKA	I’m sorry I missed your Show.

NOLA	I’m sorry I missed yours too.

SHEMEKKA	You ain’t missed anything.

NOLA	Neither did you, actually.
