THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching.? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Philip is an enthusiastic little engine, who loves to show everyone how good he is at shunting and how good he is at racing.

THE EARL OF SODOR	But it looks like Philip has got rather confused...<Gasp> That very big engine is on the same track! Ohhh look out, Philip!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

The EARL OF SODOR	Which engine was on the same track as Philip? Was it Henry? Was it Spencer? Or was it Gordon?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Gordon is on the track with Philip! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	That was close. It's lucky Philip can reverse quickly too! Ohh Philip, you need to pay attention to what you're doing instead of rushing around.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray! That was fun. Let's play again!

THE EARL OF SODOR	Lots of wonderful animals live here on Sodor. They live in the trees, in the fields and in the lakes and rivers...

THE EARL OF SODOR	But it's dangerous for animals to stray onto the tracks.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Luckily, today Thomas has come to this little lamb's rescue!

THOMAS	How many lambs did the guard pick up? Was it one? Was it two? Or was it three?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Thomas rescued one lamb. And he found even more sheep further down the track...

THE EARL OF SODOR	Thomas collected all the sheep and returned them safely to Farmer McColl.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Oh, jolly well done for playing! I look forward to seeing you again next time. Goodbye!
