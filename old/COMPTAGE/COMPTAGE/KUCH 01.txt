All	Good morning, sir!

Dev	Good morning.

Female1	Good morning, sir.

Dev	Good morning.

Female1	Sir, Mr. Bose is waiting for you.

Female1	Sir! Today at 4 pm, you have...

Male2	Good morning. 

Dev	Good morning.

Female1	...a meeting with Mr. Oberoi.

Male3	Good morning.

Dev	Good morning.

Female1	And, then you'll meet the London delegation. -

Male4	Good morning, sir.

Dev	Good morning.

Male5	Good morning, sir.

Dev	Good morning.

Mr. Bosh	Mr. Dev, your deal is final.

Mr. Bosh	But, I can get you a better deal.

Mr. Bosh	Look at this. In Greater Kailash 2. What a bungalow!

Mr. Bosh	4500 square feet.

Mr. Bosh	It's five minutes away from the M block market.

Mr. Bosh	Have you seen the movie, "Piku"? It was shot there.

Mr. Bosh	Director Shoojit Sircar. He's Bengali.

Mr. Bosh	And this is Satyajit Ray. When he came to Delhi...

Dev	Are the papers ready?

Male2	Sir, I've checked the papers of this property.

Male2	You can sign on them.
Mr. Bosh	Mr. Dev, you're paying way too much for this house.

Mr. Bosh	With your budget, you could get a house in a better location.

Dev	I can get a house. Not a home.

Dev	Mr. Bose, I'm looking to buy a home, not a house.

Mr. Bosh	You're a very emotional man, just like me. When I saw the film, "Parineeta"... ...Pradeep Sarkar. I cried bitterly at the end.

Dev	Help yourself to some sweets.

Mr. Bosh	Thank you.

Dev	The box is for you.

Mr. Bosh	For me?

Mr. Bosh	Thank you so much!

Mr. Bosh	Mr. Dev, you're a different kind of man.

Mr. Bosh	I mean, you've bought a house worth 70 million in a place where...

Dev	There are no elite neighbors?

Mr. Bosh	Yes. I mean, why such a place?

Dev	Because...

Dev	...a tree may reach very high, but never lets go of its roots.

Dev	Are you crying?

Ishwari	No.

Dev	Are you happy?

Ishwari	Are you?

Dev	Yes.

Ishwari	Then, I'm happy, too.

Dev	Why the tears, then?

Ishwari	These tears?

Ishwari	The heart is unpredictable.

Ishwari	Excessive joy has made me shed tears.

Ishwari	If your dad were here today...

Dev	No matter where he is...

Dev	...he must be proud of you.

Dev	You've protected the childhood of your kids, so well...

Dev	...I bet no one else could do it.

Ishwari	We've come after so many years!

Ishwari	Everything is so different. Harilala used to have a shop here, before. And then there was the house of Nanku, the confectioner. A little further was an oak tree, under which... ...an old beggar used to sit.

Dev	You used to feed him every day.

Ishwari	Yes.

Dev	I used to fight with you about it every day.

Dev	Why do you give him your flatbread?

Dev	You said, that...

Ishwari	God may have made us poor...

Ishwari	...but, don't have a pauper's heart.

Ishwari	Let's pay our respects to Lord Shiva and then go home.

Dev	Ram Singh, stop the car.

Dev	Mom.

Dev	Let's settle the old scores, today.

Ishwari	No!

Dev	Why, mom? You always said so that...

Dev	...a son is a mother's stick.

Dev	A stick provides support and punishment.

Ishwari	No, Dev! Don't engage something that makes you bitter. Stay away from it. We have to do the same with bitter memories. Yes, my son. God has granted us everything. You've studied and made something of yourself. Neha is getting married, next month. Everything is going well Why are you... ...reopening your old wounds? Come along. Let's go.

Ishwari	Okay, tell me. Who used to live here?

Dev	Aunt Savitri.

Ishwari	Very nice. You remember everything!

Dev	That's it. It's easy to remember.

Dev	It's tough to forget.

Ishwari	Do you think, the kids are home?

Dev	Yes. Uncle, aunt, Neha, Ria, Nikki. All of them.

Dev	Nikki must be yelling, already.

Nikki	Sister!

Nikki	What a huge house!

Nikki	I mean, you'd need to have roaming on your phone, it's so huge!

Nikki	Have you seen Neha's room? It's the largest room.

Nikki	Let's tell her to exchange rooms. Please!

Riya	You talk to her. I'm happy...

Riya	...with what Dev has given me.

Nikki	What is it with you? Don't you want anything, ever? You're the Goddess of Satisfaction, personified! Anyways, the first selfie in the new house. Come on! Come on, I taught you to do the duck face. This way.

Mamaji	Let's have a selfie with me, too.

Riya	Uncle, this is a selfie.

Riya	You have to click it for yourself.

Nikki	Besides, teenage girls look cute, pouting.

Nikki	Not you!

Mamaji	Listen to me. This is an awesome house. Everything here, will seem cute. Including me! Besides, this isn't a house, it's a palace. Look at your aunt! She moving around, looking shell shocked.

Nikki	What was that again?

Mamaji	Shell shocked.

Nikki	Uncle, you're so cute. We want to see Neha's room. Bye!

Mamaji	Dev has got a fantastic house. Right, dear? What do you think?

Riya	There are so many butterflies in Neha's room!

Riya	Dev remembers that she has always loved butterflies.

Riya	Neha! Do you remember, what you used to say as a kid?

Riya	The flowers which have wings...

Riya	...turn into butterflies, right?

Nikki	Dev didn't even put up so much as a fly in my room!

Nikki	Neha, your room is the best in the house. It's the very best.

Neha	The best? What's so great about it? As usual, it's a very normal room.

Nikki	Please Neha, stop doing that. Anyway, I like this room the most. I have an idea. You'll get married after a month. Then, I'll stay on in this room. I will have pizza and wipe my hands on the curtains of your room. I'll spill ketchup on the floor, while eating sandwiches. Then, Ria will apply oil in my hair... ...while I rub my head all over this pillow!

Neha	You're asking for a thrashing. Come here. It's going to my room even after the wedding. No one will come here.

Nikki	So possessive. You don't like the room. Why are you upset, then?

Neha	It's okay. But the best part is... ...that cupboard. It's lovely.

Nikki	Come on.

Neha	Why is this locked?

Male6	It has to be shifted. It came here, by mistake.

Neha	Let it be.

Male6	No, ma'am. It has to be shifted.

Neha	What do you mean? I want it here.

Male6	Mr. Dev said so, specifically.

Dev	It's taken years, but we are finally back home.

Mamaji	My dear, why are you in tears? What is it?

Mamaji	I get it. These are tears of joy, right?

Radharani	Ishwari! So, you're here.

Radharani	Just see, what a lovely house Dev has got us.

Mamaji	Radha, very important men live in houses like these. Ishwari has worked very hard... ...for Dev's success.

Ishwari	No, I just did what every mother does. Dev has done everything on his own steam.

Mamaji	Ishwari, take a tour of your home.

Ishwari	Yes, sure. I have to first...

Dev	Use the kitchen

Dev	This is your kitchen.

Dev	It's got everything.

Ishwari	It's really huge.

Ishwari	Who is this, Dev?

Dev	Let me show you. Come along.

Dev	Come here, mom.

Ishwari	Dev, what is this?

Ishwari	The ladies of the family cook the first meal.

Dev	Mom, you've worked enough. From today, you're not going to be in the kitchen.

Ishwari	Dev! A kitchen isn't just about cooking. It's the mother's best friend. It supports a mother through thick and thin. When a mother sheds tears... ...she slices onions in the kitchen to hide them. When she smiles, she shares it... ...by making sweets in the kitchen.

Dev	I know, mom. I know, the house and hearth is for kids. But, the mother...

Ishwari	Has the kitchen.

Ishwari	You know all this. Then, why are you taking my kitchen from me? Who are you giving it to?

Dev	Mom, he's from Nathu the confectioner's place. He will make sure, the place is clean and hygienic.

Male7	Mother, I bathed the day before yesterday.

Ishwari	Dev, I'll make the profiteroles.

Ishwari	Sir, please excuse me.

Dev	Mom!

Dev	If you make the sweets, who will sit for the veneration?

Ishwari	I'll do everything...

Ishwari	The veneration?

Ishwari	Have you organized a veneration at home?

Dev	Just for you.

Dev	I never got along with your God. I still don't.

Ishwari	Dev! I've told you not to say that, so often. At least, today you should bow down to God. For me.

Dev	Alright.

Dev	Here you are. I've bowed down to God.

Ishwari	God bless you.

Male8	Sir, I'll do it.

Dev	It's okay, I'll do it.

Dev	Where is the container for the holy fire?

Male8	Sir, it's in the garage and the door is locked. The estate agent forgot to give us the keys.

Dev	Okay, you can leave.

Dev	Hello, Bose?

Sonakshi	Bose speaking.

Dev	I need to speak to Mr. Bose.

Sonakshi	Trying to act over smart, are you? Naughty! You want sweets after sugar, now? You can't get away with this.

Dev	What did you say?

Sonakshi	You can't get away with this, since mom loves you.

Dev	What do you mean, ma'am?

Sonakshi	One moment. I didn't speak to you. Why are you screaming? Who do you want to speak to?

Dev	I need to speak to Mr. Saurav Bose. Is this his number?

Sonakshi	Yes, actually, my brother left his phone at home. These days, he's acting lost. I think, he should have vitamin B 12.

Dev	Listen, when will he return?

Sonakshi	I don't know. Leave your name and message.

Dev	My name is Dev Dixit. Tell him to call me. Thank you.

Sonakshi	Dev Dixit.

Sonakshi	VIP culture. Don't be specific and don't care about specifics.

Bunty	Hey! It's a cupboard. It's not Priyanka Chopra, so lay off.

Dev	All you can see is Priyanka Chopra.

Bunty	Of course! I do, so what? Oh, man! This is amazing. Dev, this is amazing. I've seen such houses, only in films.

Bunty	Amazing! You've got a huge house and forgotten me!

Dev	Bunty, I can't forget you.

Bunty	Congratulations. Your dream of making aunt a house owner... ...rather than a tenant, has come true, today.

Dev	Yes.

All	Yes!  That's a six!

All	Come on!

Bunty	Dev, do you remember how much fun it was to play here?

Dev	I hit so many sixes off your bowling.

Bunty	So, big deal! As if you were aiming for the moon.

Bunty	The six run mark was till the juice vendor's shop.

Dev	And Ratna Tea room was out.

Bunty	Honestly, if you hadn't quit street cricket at the age of nine...

Bunty	...you would be playing instead of Kohli (cricketer).

Bunty	But, you had a different set of ambitions.

Bunty	Do you remember?

Bunty	That teacher, in the third grade?

Dev	Yes.

Bunty	You know, the bald guy.

Dev	Yes.

Bunty	He once asked all of us about our ambition.

Bunty	Dubey, the fatty said, he wants to be an engine driver.

Bunty	He used to look like a rhino.

Bunty	But, he wanted to be an engine driver. And me? You know me. I've been hitting the left cut, since childhood. I thought, I'd be an ace cricketer.

Bunty	But, you said...

Dev	I want to be a good son.

Bunty	What the heck?

Bunty	You've always had boring dreams. Ask me for interesting dreams. In the fourth grade, I had the most amazing dreams. But Dev, be honest with me. Didn't you dream of anything else, ever?

Dev	Well, my mind... ...didn't have any space for any other dream.

All	First, me! Me first.

All	It's my turn.

All	I came here, first.

Ishwari	Stop it. Wait for two minutes. Wait. Yes, I'll take it.

Ishwari	You won't even let me get it together.

Female3	Here, mom. Let me help you.

Ishwari	Why did you stop studying and come here?

Ishwari	Go and study!

Bunty	What is it?

Dev	Nothing. Let's go.

Bunty	Let's tell Nathu, he's making the sweets.

Dev	Did you speak to the priest?

Bunty	Yes, I did.

Dev	Is everything ready for the veneration? 

Bunty	Yes.

Neha	Bunty organized everything. For your mom, no less. How can anything go wrong?

Bunty	Dev, there was once a singer Tansen. And she's the taunting girl. You can't help yourself, right?

Neha	But, what's the use? With shameless people like you... ...the taunts are wasted.

Bunty	See, the fact is that... ...shamelessness is an art, Ms. Taunting girl.

Neha	Really?

Bunty	Well...

Bunty	...it's getting really hot in here.

Bunty	I'm going to check on things outside.

Dev	Neha.

Dev	How do you like your room?

Neha	It's nice.

Dev	You know, your room is the most beautiful one in the room. It's the biggest room, with the biggest bathtub.

Neha	Mom didn't send me to a fancy school, like you.

Neha	Nor did she have fine dreams for me. So, the big house and the big room... ...is meant to be compensation, right?

Dev	Neha.

Neha	Dev. Since childhood, till college at every event... ...you won gold medals. You won a silver medal only once. How long were you angry for? Do you remember? Think about it. When, I was born with a silver medal around my neck... ...how do I feel? My mom treated me like second best, all my life. Won't it upset me?

Dev	Neha! I can't change, what's happened. But, you tell me. Tell me, what you want. I will do what you want.

Neha	In that case... ...I want this cupboard.

Dev	Alright, you'll have the same kind of cupboard, tomorrow.

Neha	I don't want this kind, I want this cupboard.

Neha	I want it today.

Dev	Neha.

Neha	I will get what I want.

Radharani	Neha. Where are you going off, so purposefully? Look at me, once.

Neha	Aunt.

Radharani	What is it? Why are you looking so sad? Don't cry now, please. Leave your tears for your farewell. If you don't cry then... ...people will question your morals.

Radharani	I have to say something. We've prepared very well for your wedding. Honestly, Dev is just as ideal as Lord Ram. What is it? Did you fight with him? Siblings tend to quarrel. What is the problem, if he said something? He's your brother. He can say something.

Neha	Yes. He does say things very casually. He said, he would do anything for me. But, what happened? He couldn't even give me a cupboard.

Radharani	You've given over your childhood, to him. He could have given you the cupboard. What is so special about it, though? I have to see it. What does a boy like Dev... ...hide from his entire family?

Dev	Hello, Mr. Bose?

Sonakshi	Tell me.

Dev	I need to speak to Mr. Bose.

Sonakshi	He's not back yet.

Dev	When will he be back?

Dev	Your brother hasn't done his job completely.

Dev	And...

Sonakshi	One moment.

Sonakshi	Why are you scolding me?

Sonakshi	I'm Bose, not Saurav Bose. Control your temper. Eat bottle gourd. It'll help.

Dev	Listen, miss...

Sonakshi	You're the fool.

Dev	What is that? Why are you speaking in Bengali?

Sonakshi	I'm not your property dealer or your translator.

Sonakshi	So, goodbye.

Dev	Hello?

Ishwari	Dev doesn't like dry profiteroles! Add some clarified butter.

Ishwari	Oh, no!

Dev	What is it?

Ishwari	I dropped this, son.

Ishwari	It's nothing.

Dev	Mom, come here.

Dev	Can't you watch what you're doing? Is this any way to work?

Ishwari	Dev! Dev! Dev, nothing has happened to me. Dev, he's not a fault. Actually, the oil spilt over. Scold the oil.

Dev	Mom!

Ishwari	I am fine, son. It's just a bit of...

Dev	Mom!

Dev	Let's go.

Ishwari	I'm fine.

Dev	Let's go.

Ishwari	I'm fine. Listen to me.

Ishwari	I'm fine, my son.

Radharani	Where are you going?

Radharani	Wait. Things happen at home. Just let it go. Tell me, what did Dev keep in that cupboard? Don't you want to see?

Radharani	Here! See? Let's go.

Dev	Where is the first aid box?

Ishwari	Oh, no!

Ishwari	Why are you getting so hassled, Dev? I am fine.

Dev	Mom, stop it.

Ishwari	I'm fine, I told you.

Ishwari	What was that?

Dev	Hey, wait.

Dev	Sit down.

Dev	Sit down. I'll see.

Ishwari	Sure, go and see.


Dev	Neha!

Radharani	Dev, what is this? Why did you lock all this up?

Radharani	This is a lovely, expensive cupboard. What have you put into this? It's all scrap! All that effort and nothing for it.

Radharani	These disgusting worn out slippers. Whose are they?

Radharani	This torn shawl, which is ancient.

Radharani	A torn diary. What is in it?

Radharani	12th February, 1997. The house rent...

Radharani	...1500, Dev's...

Neha	Aunt, let it be.

Radharani	Wait for a moment. Tea leaves, wood, tape, paper, uniform, water bills. Ew!

Radharani	What is this, Dev? This is just...

Ishwari	This is all mine.

Radharani	Why have you filled scrap into this?

Dev	Enough.

Dev	How much time did it take you to get here?

Radharani	We arrived here, soon. It took about 25 minutes.

Dev	But, my mother took 25 years to get to this house.

Dev	And the journey was long. That's why, you wear your shoes out.

Dev	This diary contains the old accounts and... ...sometimes a hundred rupee note. But, it was much more. It contained a lot of tiny dreams. When a child is hurt, it's not just money spent on him... ...it's the loss of many dreams. The diary... ...has the account of her dreams. If you think, this is scrap... ...well, this isn't scrap. For me, this is... ...my mother's hard work.

Ishwari	Dev.

Ishwari	It's time for the veneration. Neha, go and get ready, fast. Your in-laws will be here, soon.

Dev	From now on... ...no one will touch this cupboard. Neha. You will get a cupboard like this one, tomorrow.
