chris	radio controlled, toy monster truck things. 
corrine	oh yeah, my little brother had one, yeah.
chris	right, so, he got it for her as like this gag gift, for her birthday. and she’s out, you know, test driving it around the block. and he’s like, egging her on.
chris	and she accidentally cuts off a car.
corrine	mhm. 
chris	driver overcorrects, plows into a tree. everyone dies.
chris	mom, two kids .
chris	she, um...
chris	well, she really just blamed her ex for, you know, pushing her to try this thing. and, um...

corrine	should i... go?
corrine	hey, you can come and shoot me any time, you know. without my permission. it’s ok. ok? 
corrine	alright.
rachel	oh, please don’t touch me! 
chris	so then i guess sex is out of the question?

chris	what?
rachel	that’s what he was barking at! i know it! he hated that thing even more than i do.

rachel	i never should have let you put him out there.
chris	sweetheart, i am sorry. i am really sorry.
rachel	just go. go to work.
chris	i can’t leave you like this.
rachel	you don’t need to waste a whole day trying to make me feel better. i’m not going to.
reporter	it’s been three weeks since the death of ramsey theodore sambino, the man that police are saying killed seven women over the past two years under the alias known as the violator.
reporter	but we still know very little about what led the solitary man to commit such atrocious acts.
singer	here i am. dreaming of you.
singer	wouldn’t you be my dream
singer	come true
paprazzi	rachel! rachel!
mom	don't cry
man	i love you
violator	this is not how it ends!
rachel	[gasp]
chris	rach, you sound insane. 
rachel	chris, i’m telling you, the drone was trying to communicate with me. it was operating the 
tv. 
chris	wait, now the tv is in on this? 
rachel	you’re not listening to me, as usual! 
chris	baby, have you been drinking tonight? 
rachel	chris! i’m not drunk! and i’m not insane! ok? i saw it! i saw it take words from peoples’ mouths to form this message and then lightning struck and the tv turned white. 
chris	a drone did this? 
rachel	i’m starting to think you didn’t even take those pictures.
chris	what pictures?
chris	jesus.
chris	babe. why didn’t you tell me about this.
rachel	i tried too. i thought you didn’t want me to know.
chris	i didn’t do this.
chris	maybe
chris	it was being driven by the drones previous owner. 
rachel	no
rachel	these pics are dated.
rachel	the drone put these on the desktop for me to find.
rachel	oh. and this.
chris	wait.
rachel	and that’s not all. the drone moves around the house by itself
rachel	first it’s here. then it’s there.
chris	okay. wait. hold on.
chris	you know what? maybe.
chris	there’s something wrong with 
this.
chris	this didn’t come with the drone you know.
chris	oh wait, maybe the drone is reacting to a different controller.
rachel	this is more than a wrong controller chris..
chris	listen. maybe whoever bought the drone has the controller. 
probably :
chris	lives in the neighborhood. and i bet has been trying to call the drone home. 
rachel	the drone is controlling itself!
