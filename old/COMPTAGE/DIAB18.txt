SERIE DIABETE
EP. 18 – CORALIE (LONG)



1 (01:00:00:00)

CAMILLE	Hello everybody! Today, I want to talk about the relationship between body and image for people with diabetes. This is definitely a current topic since our devices are becoming more and more visible each day. Coralie is here to talk about this today... a.k.a. "Coco and Podie" on Instagram. (h/) Coralie is an inspiring and positive influencer' who sheds a new, fashionable light on diabetes..

CORALIE	(h/) (laughs)

CAMILLE	Hello, Coralie.

CORALIE	Hello, Camilla.

CAMILLE	I'm really happy to have you here with me today.

CORALIE	Well, I'm happy to be here, sitting on this super famous 'generation Type-One' couch. It's super cool!

CAMILLE	(mm) Let the video begin!

CORALIE	video begin!

2 (01:00:38:07)

CAMILLE	So( uh_), would you mind introducing yourself to everyone? Tell us about yourself, when you were diagnosed...

CORALIE	My name's Coralie, (h/) I'm twenty-four years old, (uh_m) I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was nine years old, so I've had it for almost sixteen years. And my presentation wouldn't be complete if I didn't mention( uh )'Podie', as well. (h/) ( uh ) It's the pet name I've given to my diabetes, over the years. My pump is actually called 'Podie', so there's a sticker on the side of the pump with the name 'Podie' on it. (h/) And, well, since my nickname is 'Coco', (h/) and the other part of me is my diabetes, that I... ended up naming 'Podie', so 'Coco and Podie' is the profile name I use on my Instagram account.

3 (01:01:15:11)

CAMILLE	Could you tell us a bit about your Instagram account, why it's so important to you and why you created it?

CORALIE	(tsk h/) Well, I created my account four years ago. (mts) In fact( uh ), I took a look around and quickly realized I couldn't find anybody with whom( uh )I could really identify with on Instagram, and then I also noticed that all of the bloggers out there were all kind of, you know...

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	it was all more or less... let's just say their Instagram was solely dedicated to their online personalities, but I thought we could use Insta to talk about something truly important to us. So I said to myself: well, if I can't find anyone or anything that inspires me, maybe I should create the content myself.

CAMILLE	(mm)


4 (01:01:47:18)

CORALIE	(h/ )So I decided to try my luck and I create 'Coco and Podie', and my main goal was always to truly... show all of the medical side from an artistic point of view.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	I wanted to mimic all those bloggers... but all while putting my diabetes... front and center. So that meant imitating the aesthetic codes but also including my insulin pump or my sensor...

CAMILLE	Yeah...

CORALIE	I wanted to show people we have the right to be fashionable, to do things, to go out for dinner. So on my Instagram account, you'll see a photo of the beautiful dish I'm about to eat, side by side with my insulin pump. It's my version of what some people would call a "fashion photo".

CAMILLE	Yeah.

CORALIE	(h/m)

CAMILLE	(mm)


5 (01:02:22:21)

CORALIE	So that was the first thing I noticed, then the second thing I noticed was that most don't know the difference between a Type-One and a Type-Two, (h/ )and... well, it seemed to me that using social media could be the best way to explain it to them.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	(h/) So with that in mind, my idea was... if I can reach people who have diabetes... and show them... that I understand them, but at the same time, I wanted to create some sort of visual trigger by using photos. Because, if you see the photo of a young woman who has a... a sensor placed on her arm, you're gonna say: 'that's strange, she's so young, she shouldn't have any medical devices.

CAMILLE	Yeah.

CORALIE	(h/ )And( uh) people who are curious will click on it, visit the page and say 'Oh, wow, she has diabetes. I thought it was an old person's disease. I guess I was wrong, I didn't know about that.

CAMILLE	Yeah. (Mm)


6 (01:02:59:11)

CORALIE	I'm sure you've already heard things like that. (laughs_) That's when you know people really don't understand, but, yeah, that's what made me want to...

CAMILLE	Yeah.

CORALIE	show people a new image of diabetes, and, at the same time, increase awareness, because that's one of the most important things for me.

CAMILLE	(mm) Would you say that you're more comfortable with your diabetes now that you have an Instagram page, or( uh...) or did it not make a real difference for you?


7 (01:03:20:00)

CORALIE	(tsk) It has made a world of difference to me.( laughs) Seriously, (h/) Because, when I was younger, I went through a phase, I don't know if it's a normal teenager phase, don't know if you went through this, but for a while, I didn't want to talk about it.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	I was like: 'Diabetes, yeah, I know I have it, but( ff ff ) I don't really want to deal with it. I was in school, middle school then high school, (h/) I was managing it, but I didn't want to tell anyone about it, I didn't want to show them I was different.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	(h/) And after, I understood being different was my strength, and that, in turn, had made me even more unique than I was. (h/) So I decided that, if I had to be different, then I would showcase it. And, I've been showcasing my diabetes through my Instagram page and doing my best to raise awareness... (h/_)

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	because it's what makes us different and stronger, and, yes, it helped me become... who I am today.

INSERT	ADVICE AND TIPS


8 (01:04:03:22)

CAMILLE	Now that this disease is becoming more and more visible, even though it's supposed to be an invisible disease, (h/) do you have any advice, or any feedback for people who are having... problems accepting the fact that this disease is becoming more recognizable or "visible" with all the new medical devices available to us nowadays?

CORALIE	(mh/) (Uhm ) Well, first of all, I'd like to reassure everyone that it's completely normal to sometimes want to hide it. There are days when you won't want to show your devices. (h/)

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	It happens to me as well. Today, I have absolutely no problem showing off my pump or wearing short sleeves, but there are days when we're more tired than others, and we don't feel up to answering questions, so we end up wearing long sleeves to cover it up. But we can't when it's summer time,( laughs )

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	we can't always do that. (h/)


9 (01:04:41:18)

CORALIE	What I really like is personalizing my diabetes, and changing it into a fashion accessory. (h/) And I can go as far as to say that it makes some of my friends jealous.

CAMILLE	(laughs)

CORALIE	You can see on my pump that I have a casing,

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	and... in fact it's totally removable, it's a casing you can put on every new Omnipod.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	I chose this one because it has glitter, it's black and made out of silicone and I like it. (h/) And( um) my tip to everyone would be ... (mts) Do what you can to make diabetes a little "more fun" quote unquote.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	But choose what you want to make it more festive, or colorful. Some people use stickers, that's always a good choice, but that's not really my thing, I prefer having a casing because you can keep it for an awfully long time, and that's real cool.

CAMILLE	(mm) yep


10 (01:05:17:14)

CORALIE	And if I had to give a tip to someone who wanted to hide it, well, I don't really want people to hide their devices.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	(h/) I feel we should be proud of who we are and use the fact that we're different to become someone strong.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	But there will obviously be a period in our life, before we're able to be strong, where we'll have to go through, well, in my opinion, to go through a phase of denial and wanting to hide it at all cost.

CAMILLE	Yeah, you're right, yes. (mm)

CORALIE	You go through phases, but when you're ready to accept it and... you start putting on... the stickers or you start accessorizing it and you're proud, and people come up to you and ask you what it is, that's really cool.

CAMILLE	You're right.


11 (01:05:47:06)

CORALIE	So, to answer your question 'what advice would I like to give people, (h/) is that you should hide it during summer. I do because I want to avoid having multiple tan lines,

CAMILLE	Oh yeah.

CORALIE	because my pump was visible, or( uh_) Well, I always leave my sensor on my arm, I know some people are capable of putting it wherever they want.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	(h/) but my pump always goes on my lower back and then I put my swimsuit bottom over it.

CAMILLE	Okay.

CORALIE	(h/ )That way we don't have a weird tan line because of your device, and on top of it, you're insulin stays cold...

CAMILLE	Yeah.

CORALIE	because the bottom of your swimsuit... is wet.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	So, thanks to that, your insulin isn't boiling hot.

CAMILLE	Pretty clever, well done.

CORALIE	That's the only time I'll hide it, but it works out okay.

CAMILLE	Yeah, I get it.


12 (01:06:19:03)

CAMILLE	Do you think that social media has helped you find a sense of liberation with regards to your physical appearance?

CORALIE	Absolutely.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	I think, and tell me if you agree, but there are many different types of people asserting themselves.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	There was a ... big is beautiful women's movement where they proudly walked, where they showed off their bodies and their curves.

CAMILLE	Yeah (mm)

CORALIE	(h/) There was also a fashion model, her name is Winnie Harlow, and her skin disease gives her discolored patches all over her, and yet she's proud of herself and beautiful the way she is.

CAMILLE	Yeah. (mm)

CORALIE	There are multiple social movements, so I started to wonder where all the diabetics were hiding. (laughs) Where are all the beautiful diabetic women with their patches? I mean, after all, those are the beauty standards that we identify with first.

CAMILLE	(mm)


13 (01:06:56:03)

CORALIE	We are beautiful with our sensors, we are beautiful with our patches and our pumps and our tubes and all. And... well, social media has allowed me, in my opinion, to free myself, and I hope that it will in turn free other people, because this will help create new standards for us, ones we can identify with openly and... For me, that's the most important thing. And we seem to be following the movement that will hopefully free the body as well as the mind.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	For us, freedom will be when we're able to show everyone who we are, and that also means showing our devices... which are... and I don't want them to be considered ugly anymore, that needs to stop now.

CAMILLE	Yeah.

CORALIE	They are what they are and they're part of us no matter what and you can't change who you are, so...

CAMILLE	(mm) Yeah, it's part of who you are.

CORALIE	(_hh_) Absolutely.

CAMILLE	(mm)

INSERT	IN CONCLUSION


14 (01:07:37:23)

CORALIE	(mts) I would say that this right here... (h/ )let's just call it 'diabetes' for those who don't wear an Omnipod, (h/ ) is your biggest strength. It truly is.

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	It's... Diabetes gives you... it gives you courage to do things, it gives you empathy, it gives you... (h/) it gives you the strength to conquer anything you want. And... "thanks" to diabetes, in some way, we can see the bright side of things, the proverbial glass half empty, half full,

CAMILLE	(mm)

CORALIE	it's an old expression, but it's true... But once I understood what it really meant, I said: 'Oh yeah, that makes sense now!' So, when I decided to... look at my disease from a "positive standpoint,(laughs) I realized that, thanks to this disease, I met some amazing people,... and also had some incredible experiences... thanks to my diabetes. I never would have thought it possible in a hundred years. I was the type of person who never wanted to talk about... her diabetes with anyone. I was mortified and ashamed. (h/) And then I decided to invert it and make it my strength, because I had it and I knew it was here to stay. So I decided to embrace it, and from that moment on, I've had only positive things happen. It's all been positive.

CAMILLE	(mm) Okay. Thank you so much for being here.

CORALIE	Thanks for having me! (laughs)
