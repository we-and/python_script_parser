KAREN	What we wanna know is where we can stay.  

OPHELIA	It looks like we’re all gonna be roommates.

LISA	Really…

JAMES	We’re free to do what we want, when we want to, with who we want.

OPHELIA	You’re an incredible asshole.

FREDDY	I fuckin’ love college.

KAREN	Is this guy for real?

OPHELIA	Aw, yeah.

JAMES	Who’s your daddy?

BLOND	Brian Talbert.  Why?

LISA	I just want a good education.

JOSE	Whatta ya talkin’ about?

KAREN	Tell me again why I’m dressed up like some pet-ville sweater monkey?

ROBBIE	Baby, I told you.  It’s top secret.

KAREN	(frustrated sound)

ROBBIE	Okay, okay, wait, wait, I’ll tell you.  But for your own safety, you can’t tell anyone.  I know you look at me and you see nothing more than this muscle-bound tight-end, but peel back the façade, you’ll find a man’s who’s dedicated to the truth.

KAREN	Really?

ROBBIE	I’m workin’ undercover for the campus news.

KAREN	Oh!  My roommate, Lisa, she’s a reporter for the campus station.

ROBBIE	There, that’s why you can’t break cover.

KAREN	Okay, okay, I won’t.  I swear…  So, what’s the story?

ROBBIE	Okay, well, I’m investigating the coach, trying to prove that he’s been slippin’ the players steroids.  I mean, I just, like, feel like I have to inform the public, ya know, like shine the light on the truth.  I mean, these poor children and their innocent lives and just…  mm…  I’m sorry, I just get all fired up when I think about it.

KAREN	It’s okay.  I understand.  I know how you feel.

ROBBIE	I didn’t mean to scare you.  I just feel like I can talk to you.

KAREN	No, you didn’t scare me, but, um, why am I dressed up like a cheerleader?

ROBBIE	Shh…  I said too much, already.  You have no idea of what kind of danger you’re in, here.

KAREN	I’ll take the risk.  I just feel like you deserve some sort of reward.

ROBBIE	Oh my god.  This is better than a Pulitzer.  

KAREN	Mm.  My roommate, Lisa, she is a master at this.  She taught me to suck out all the badger poison.  Mm…

ROBBIE	Badger poison…  Um… ooh…

KAREN	Long story, I’ll tell you later.

ROBBIE	(breath sounds)  …

CROWD	(cheering)

KAREN	(moaning, yeah’s, etc. – continuous)

JOSE	Yo…  Oh, oh… Ah… Oh, no…  C’mon, man…  

JAMES	Look, dude.  I’m giving you 8 points on the over-under.  Okay?  You wanna piece of this action, your fuckin’ loss, buddy.

OPHELIA	(light moans)

JAMES	… Ohh!

JOSE	Ooh!

OPHELIA	(light moaning – continuous)

JAMES/JOSE	Ohh!!

JAMES	Oh, no!!

OPHELIA	Ah…  (light moans)

JOSE	Oh, no.

JAMES	Oh!

OPHELIA	(moaning – continuous)

JAMES	Go!  Go!

OPHELIA	(moaning – continuous)

JAMES	Go!  …  Go, go, go, go, go!

JOSE	Go, go, go, go, go…

JAMES	Ohh…

JAMES	Great.

JOSE	Why’d they give the ball to Robbie?  For Christ sakes, don’t throw him the ball, Langford.

JAMES	Yeah, good fuckin’ question…  If anybody, if it’s for me, I died.

OPHELIA	James, we need to talk.

JAMES	can’t it wait?  I’m kinda on a run, here.

OPHELIA	What happened last night?  …  When you said you’d never been in love?  …  Did you really mean that?  …  Ah, you’re not even listening to me, are you?

LISA	Robbie Langford benched by the coach after yet, another fumble.  Let’s try to get a word from him.  Robbie, Lisa Wilcox, Campus News.  Can you tell us what happened out there, today?

ROBBIE	I don’t know.  I just thought that, um…  Did you say your name was Lisa?

LISA	Yes, Lisa Wilcox.  Campus News.	

ROBBIE	Ah.  I heard all about you.

LISA	Really!?

ROBBIE	I heard you give the best blow jobs.

ROBBIE	Learn how to suck out all the badger poison.

LISA	(coughs)  Cut…

FREDDY	You slept with Robbie, for Christ sake, ‘Don’t throw the ball’ Langford?

KAREN	We didn’t do any sleeping.

FREDDY	The guy’s a moron.

KAREN	Actually, he’s quite complex.

FREDDY	Oh, please, let me guess.  He used, We’re working on a big story and people deserve to know the truth, speech.

KAREN	No.  Well, yeah.  But he sounded so…

FREDDY	Full of shit.  He uses that crap on every girl.  See, I expected more from you…  You’re better than that.  You’re better than him…  And now he goes on air and tell, tells everybody about Lisa’s badger sucking prowess.

KAREN	What?

FREDDY	Yeah, Robbie announced on the air waves that Lisa taught you how to give incredibly good blow jobs.

KAREN	Oh, my god.

LISA	Karen!  …

KAREN	I can explain.

LISA	You, you… B – I – T – C – H!

KAREN	I know.  I’m sorry, I blew it.

FREDDY	That’s what Robbie said, over the loud speaker during the half-time show.  (light laugh)

LISA	How could you do this to me?

KAREN	I didn’t do it to you.  Robbie did it.  And I’m just as horrified as you are.  He told everybody about me blowing him.

FREDDY	Hey, no PR’s bad PR...  (very light laugh)

LISA	He ruined my whole life.

KAREN	Okay.  Just relax.  It’s a campus news station, for god’s sakes.  Nobody watches it…  It’ll be forgotten by tomorrow.  I promise.

GUY	Badger poison! (??)

LISA	(screams)  Ah…

ANNOUNCER	Attention all students.  We just want to clarify something.  Contrary to popular rumor, the prize in this year’s homecoming raffle is not a blow job from Lisa Wilcox…  Thank you.

LISA	(spitting sound)

JOSE	Hey…  Tough day, huh?

LISA	Boys are like dogs in heat.  It’s ridiculous.  Just a couple of days ago, they never noticed me.  And now, I’m like the Arc in the Indiana Jones movies.

JOSE	Damn.  That must suck…

LISA	You’re like the only one around here who doesn’t want oral pleasure.

JOSE	Oh…  Well…  I, I am… think…

KAREN	Hi, Lisa…  How was your day?

LISA	… My day?  Well, imagine being pursued by every little horny idiot on campus, pretending that they’ve all been bitten in their nether-regions.  That’s how my day was.  How was yours?  …

OPHELIA	I’m finishing up.  I’ll be about half an hour.

JAMES	Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.

OPHELIA	Oh my god.

JAMES	Look.  Jeez, babe.  You used to love surprises…

OPHELIA	Ya know what?  Keep the mask on.

JAMES	Okay.  Where’s this going?  (muffled voice)  C’mon, you can’t stay mad at a monkey.  Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo…  whoo, whoo, whoo…

OPHELIA	Well, strictly speaking, you’re a gorilla.  And yeah, I can.

JAMES	C’mon, baby.  Throw me a banana here, will ya?  C’mon, baby.  (monkey sounds)

OPHELIA	You’re fucking nuts.  You know that?

JAMES	Uh huh.  I know that.  Mm…  (monkey sounds)

KAREN	Lisa?  Can I talk to you?

LISA	… Sure…  Let me get my camera so we can broadcast another private girlfriend moment.

KAREN	Okay, I deserved that.  But seriously, I’ve been thinking and I have a way to fix it.  You know, to make it up to you.  But first, what exactly is, True Love Waits?  What are you waiting for?

LISA	The man I’m going to spend the rest of my life with.

KAREN	And how will you know once you’ve met him?  … Okay, see, what I’ve been thinking about is that really crappy movie, you know, the one with Cher in it.

LISA	All of Cher’s movies are terrible.	

KAREN	No.  The worst one.

LISA	There’re so many to pick from.

KAREN	Okay, it has that crappy song in it.  Remember, that really crappy song.

LISA	Is this how you’re making it up to me?  Reminding me of crappy Cher songs?

KAREN	I just think that, whenever making a major life decision, it’s always wise to consult the lyrics of Cher’s 80’s hits.  Maybe it’s just me, I don’t know.  I really think I’m on to something here, I really do…  Oh, it’s that one.  It’s the one, (singing)  ‘It’s in his kiss, that’s where it is…’	

LISA	That’s the cover version.

LAREN	But it’s still good advice, right?

OPHELIA	(moaning, light laughing – etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(monkey sounds – continuous)

KAREN	Ew.  Oh my god.  I’m scarred for life…  Saves me watching the Discovery Channel for a few weeks, anyway.

OPHELIA	Whatta you want?

KAREN	I need your help.  I figured out a way to make it up to Lisa.

OPHELIA	How?

KAREN	I’m gonna get her laid.

OPHELIA	… Excuse me?

JAMES	Su-weet… 

KAREN	Ah, huh.

LISA	What’s a blind date party?

KAREN	Well, you’ll be blind-folded…

LISA	Okay…  Then what?

KAREN	Then, any potential Prince Charming who are at the party, can come up and kiss you.

LISA	I’m not doing it.

KAREN	You won’t see them.  You’ll be able to tell just by the way they kiss you, whether or not he’s your true love.  And then, you can crew his brains out…  You’re welcome…  What, Jose?

JOSE	You’re going to let anyone walk in, off the street and kiss Lisa?  What would that prove?

OPHELIA	Well, actually, scientific research has shown that the sense of touch, a kiss, for example, can generate some of the most powerful emotions.  … You can tell a lot from a kiss.

KAREN	Boo-ya!  Thank you, Cher.  And don’t worry, Lisa.  Every guy, will not get in unless they meet my personal “I will fuck him” criteria.

JOSE	(very light laugh)…

LISA	Wow.  What a great sale’s pitch., guys.

JOSE	Lisa, you don’t have to do this.

KAREN	Oh, come on.  I’m trying to make things right here, Jose.  Throw a girl a bone…  It’s worth a shot, isn’t it?  What have you got to lose?

JAMES	Ah, she could lose her hymen…

LISA	What’s a hymen? …

LISA	I can’t do this…  This isn’t working.

JOSE	Believe me, with you dressed like that…  it’ll work…

LISA	… When I made that pledge, I thought, you know, true love was gonna find me.  I didn’t think I’d have to advertise.

JOSE	No matter what happens, I’ll be here for you…

LISA	Jose, you’re so sweet.  (sighs)  I feel like you’re my… big brother…

ARTHUR	Like the young King Arthur, I’m here to try to pull the sword from the stone.

OPHELIA	Arthur Newson…  Freshman.

ARTHUR	Mm.

OPHELIA	Virgin.  Clean bill of health.

ARTHUR	Pray tell, how did you know I’m a virgin?

OPHELIA	Are you kidding?  You’ve never put your sword anywhere.  In you go.

LISA	(squeak sound)

JOSE	Ready?

LISA	Yeah.

JOSE	Okay.

LISA	(whisper)  Okay.

ARTHUR	I believe I was next…  Yeah, you taste like glue!

LISA	Oh!!  Next!!

KAREN	Go on in.

GEEK 1	Is this the place you come for, ah, free head?

KAREN	Right, um…  actually, it’s the next door, on your right.  The Alpha Beta House.  Have fun…

FREDDY	For sleeping with that idiot, Langford, I forgive you.

KAREN	I didn’t ask for your forgiveness, Freddy.	

FREDDY	And I forgive you for that one, too.

KAREN	Well, gee, thank you so much…  Well, hello there.

GEEK 2	I’m here for…

FREDDY	Upstairs, 2nd door on the left…  So, um, maybe I think, we should, ya know…

KAREN	No, I don’t know.

FREDDY	Maybe kiss and make-up?

KAREN	Fine, Freddy…

ROBBIE	Karen?

KAREN	Robbie, you have a lot of nerve showing up here.

ROBBIE	I know.  I know.  I messed up, but, ah…  I wanna make it up to you.

KAREN	It’s okay, Freddy.  I can take care of this myself…  Come inside…  Let’s talk about it upstairs…

KAREN	Oh my gosh, Robbie.  I’ve been thinking and if you’re serious about making it in the news business, I really think there’s someone you ought to meet.

ROBBIE	Is that right?  And who might that be?

KAREN	Oh my god.  She’s a total news hound.  Shits on all the big names.

ROBBIE	Really?

KAREN	Uh huh.  In fact, she’s in this room, right now, waiting for you.

ROBBIE	Yeah?

KAREN	Yeah…  Oh, and Robbie, for Christ’s sake, don’t let her near your balls.

ROBBIE	(screaming in pain)

LISA	That was nice.

JOSE	Oh…  Next.

FREDDY	Shit bag with no wedge.  Can’t drag a 62 from, from a swing back (something???) fumble.  (hard to hear, all football references)  … God…  (sigh)  … Karen, without you, my life is so bare… no air.  So bare…  I need you.  (sighs)

GEEK 2	I’m here…

LISA	Please tell me that was it.

JOSE	Looks like you’re done.  Any sign of Mr. Right?  …  Wait…  There’s one more…

LISA	(breath sounds – moaning, etc. – continuous)  …  

LISA	You’re the one.  Oh my god.  You’re the one…  (breath sounds)…

LISA	It was like a light went on, in one kiss, everything I knew, everything I believed, changed.  But who was he?  Oh god, what if it wasn’t a he?

LISA	It was a guy.  I’m pretty sure it was a guy.  So, the question is, who came to the party?

LISA	(moaning, light laughing, etc. – continuous)

FREDDY	The camera loves you, babe.

LISA	(little scream)  No, no, no, no.  (V.O.)  It wasn’t Freddy.  Oh please god, it wasn’t Freddy.

JOSE	breakfast.  Come and get some.

LISA	It couldn’t be.  Could it?  …

LISA	(light moaning, yeah’s, etc. – continuous)  …

LISA	(light moaning, light laughing, etc. – continuous) …

LISA	No, no.  No, no, no.  No.  Ah, no thank you.

JOSE	Breakfast…  C’mon, come and get some…

KAREN	You are a god amongst men.

JOSE	Well, I do my best to please.

KAREN	I don’t doubt it…  Ew, Freddy.  This is disgusting.

OPHELIA/JAMES	(very light laugh)

KAREN	I can’t eat looking at this…  Jesus.  Is that even physically possible?

FREDDY	Ah, done that.  Done that.  Done her.

JAMES	Who?  God…

OPHELIA	Well, Jose, you’re in a very good mood this morning.  What’s the occasion?

JOSE	Can’t a guy just, smile?

JAMES	No, ya know, come to think of it, there are only two reasons a guy cooks breakfast and looks happy while he’s doin’ it.

JOSE	Really?

JAMES	Yeah.  Either he just got laid or he’s about to.  See, that shit, right there?  That look is what I’m talkin’ about.  Something’s goin’ on with you, son.

KAREN	You’re hopelessly addicted to this smut, aren’t you?

FREDDY	Yeah, my name’s Freddy and I’m a pornaholic.

OPHELIA/JAMES	(light laugh)

JOSE	That’s the first step, my man.  Admitting you have a problem.

FREDDY	Who said it was a problem?

KAREN	I did.  And it’s not just porn, it’s all things sexual.

FREDDY	And…?

OPHELIA	You know, male lions sleep with up to 30 lionesses in a 7 day mating period.  They can detect whether the female in the pride is in heat by smelling her reproductive organs.

FREDDY	Yeah, I don’t do that, anymore.

JOSE	(light laugh)

KAREN	No, you like in your room all day jerking off.  You think I don’t hear you in there?

FREDDY	You’re such a bitch, you fake a headache to get outta masturbating.

KAREN	I bet you couldn’t go 10 seconds without thinking about sex.

JAMES	(laughs)

KAREN	You’re biologically incapable.

OPHELIA	Okay, that’s a bit harsh.  A day, tops.

JAMES	Alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  Hold on…  I think you ladies are on to something.  Why don’t we make it a bet?

KAREN	What?!

FREDDY	Yeah, what?

JAMES	Okay.  Who is tired, of looking at Freddy’s porn?	

JOSE	Here.

JAMES	Um hum, um hum, mm, mm.  And, who is tired of listening to Freddy enjoy his porn?

JOSE	Here, again.

KAREN	And who’s tired of all the little whores he brings home?

FREDDY	Hey, I don’t pay for sex.  Sex pays for me.

KAREN	What the hell is that supposed to mean?

FREDDY	(very, very light laugh)

JAMES	Alright, alright, alright.  Se, here’s the bet.  One week.  No sex.  No porn.

FREDDY	No problem.

KAREN	No porn.  No fucky, no sucky and no 5 finger shots.

FREDDY	That’s not fair.

JAMES	Hey.  I got 100 bucks on my boy.

FREDDY	Hey, seriously, she had a point about the 10 minute thing.

JAMES	C’mon, champ.  You can do this.  ‘Kay?  Just think like an ameba.  You no longer have sexual organs…  You’re Lisa.

LISA	Who’s what? …

JOSE	Lisa.  For you…

LISA	Whatta ya guys talking about?

JOSE	Karen bet Freddy that he can’t make it a whole week without any sexual contact.

LISA	Ooh.

JOSE	That’s right.

LISA	Okay.  I’ll take some of that action.

FREDDY	Okay.  Say that I lose, what’ll happen?

KAREN	You sleep outside for a week…  That way, maybe, we’ll get some peace and quiet around here.

FREDDY	And if I win?

KAREN	You decide.

FREDDY	Alright.  You’re on…  I’ll decide what I want, when I want it.

LISA	(very, very light laugh)  …

JOSE	You okay?

LISA	Yeah…  yeah…  No…

JOSE	Do you, want to talk about it?

LISA	Something happened to me last night.

JOSE	Me, too.

LISA	I think, just maybe, I found true love.  (screams)

JOSE	That, that’s incredible…

LISA	He, I think he’s the one…  I can’t stop thinking about it.  He opening up my Pandora’s Box…  The problem is, he’s gone.  I don’t know who he is.

JOSE	(clears throat)

LISA	But I’ll wait for my true love.

JOSE	(clears throat)

Lisa	But in the meantime, my Pandora’s Box is open for business.

JOSE	(coughing)

LISA	You should really get that checked out, Jose…

OPHELIA	In your shoe?  … Sorry, Freddy.  You thought about what you want?

FREDDY	Yeah.

OPHELIA	And?

FREDDY	Karen…  I want Karen.

KAREN	Ew, Freddy.  Forget about it.  Bet’s off.

OPHELIA	C’mon, Karen.  Take one for the team.

FREDDY	I’ll take more than one.  (very light laugh)

OPHELIA	Either way, it’ll only last 10 seconds.

KAREN	(laughs)  Okay.  Well, in that case, you’re on.

FREDDY	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  There’s nothing in there…  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  There’s nothing in here, okay?

KAREN	Let me see.

FREDDY	Why?  Don’t you trust me?

KAREN	Let me see, or forfeit, right now.

FREDDY	Happy now?

KAREN	I will be, 7 days from now…

OPHELIA	Alright, class, today we are going to be doing a little remedial art…  Freddy.

FREDDY	Isn’t this anthropology?  

OPHELIA	Yes, but I thought today we’d examine art in its earliest form.  The prehistoric cave painting…

FREDDY	(sigh sound)

OPHELIA	We’ll start with hunter, gatherer.

FREDDY	(light clears throat)

OPHELIA	Begin…

OPHELIA	Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.  This is no good.

FREDDY	Well, ya can’t create art.

OPHELIA	You see the way her breasts curves her perfectly?  The way her back arches just above her glorious, perfect ass?  …

MODEL	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

OPHELIA	And now, making fire…

MODEL	(moaning, etc. – continuous)  (screaming at end)

FREDDY	God…

GIRL	(moaning – continuous throughout scene)

FREDDY	(very light laugh)  Ah, no.  Ahh…  Work.  Working is cool…  Quantum.   Quantum, quantum…

GIRL	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

FREDDY	Quantum, quantum, quantum…  quantum.  Quantum.  Oh.  Oh…  Oh, god…

GIRLS	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

KAREN	It’s fine.  It’s natural.  It’s a great stress relaxer.  (breath sound)  It’s like yoga, without the mat…

LISA	(moaning, light laughing, screams, etc. – continuous)

FREDDY	Oh!  Oh, oh.  Mercy.  Mercy.  Ah!!  …  Oh baby bird.  Ohh!!!


JAMES	Hey, babe.

OPHELIA	Hey, you.

JAMES	(light clears throat)

OPHELIA	So, you wanna fool around?

JAMES	I, I can’t.  Right now, I’m abstaining in solidarity with my boy, Freddy.  Right, Freddy?  …  Sorry, babe.  (clears throat)  …  No.  No.

OPHELIA	Really?  Sure you don’t wanna, kiss me?  … Touch me?  …  Fuck me?  We can do whatever you want.  We can do… (??? Can’t understand, maybe some position)

JAMES	(clears throat)

OPHELIA	(??? Another position – can’t understand)

JAMES	(repeats position ???)

OPHELIA	Um, hm…

OPHELIA	(breath sounds, moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

FREDDY	Ah…  No…

LISA	(moaning – continuous)

FREDDY	Jesus, man, does she ever stop?

JOSE	I don’t know, but it’s torture,  Torture for you…

FREDDY”	(sort of singing)  Old MacDonald had a farm, and on that farm he had a pig.  Old MacDonald, Old MacDonald, Old MacDonald.

KAREN	Old MacDonald?

FREDDY	Yeah.  Nursery rhymes help, don’t ask why.

KAREN	I won’t.  C’mon, big guy.  I got the perfect place…

FREDDY	This is the perfect place/

KAREN	Yes, it is.

FREDDY	(singing)  The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round…  The wheels on the bus go round and round, (muffled) all over town…

KAREN	(light laugh)  C’mon, I have a bet to win.

FREDDY	Mary had a little lamb.  A cute little lamb.  Mary had a little lamb.  Damn lamb.

GIRL	Sorry, he’s gay.

KAREN	It’s not possible.  How did he do it?

JAMES	(very light laugh)  Because I taught him ultimate self control.

KAREN	Really?  And who taught you?

OPHELIA	Oh god, here we go.

JAMES	My guru.  My sensei.  My spiritual guide.  Steve!  I could fuck for days.  Days!

KAREN	(light laugh)

LISA	Well, it was worth it for me.

OPHELIA	How come?

LISA	I took Freddy’s porno and if he wants it back, he’s gonna have to fight me for it.

ALL	(light laugh)

JOSE	Lisa, don’t you think, maybe, you should stop goin’ through that box for a while?

LISA	Mm, mm.  (as in no)

KAREN	It’s not over, yet.  I’m not giving up.  I’m gonna break that boy, if it’s the last thing I do…

KAREN	She cried as she tried to buy all the lies, but inside, I died when I vied for her love…  Love?

FREDDY	Karen.

KAREN	Freddy, I…

FREDDY	A couple of more minutes.

KAREN	This is…

FREDDY	Private.

KAREN	It’s beautiful.  It’s just so beautiful.

FREDDY	Just don’t be telling anybody about it, alright?  …

KAREN	There’s nothing to be ashamed of, Freddy.  I think, I think you’re amazing.

FREDDY	It’s the only way I know to get those things off my mind, ya know?

KAREN	You said ‘love.’  That, you vie for my love…  Well, you have it.  You have it…  Mm…		

FREDDY	Two minutes…

KAREN	Mm…

FREDDY	Mm, mm, mm…  I, I can’t.  I can’t…  Lie back.

KAREN	Would it be so bad?

FREDDY	Your skin like an ocean, flowing and ebbing.  Your longing, in the hot desert sun…  Your flower blossoming, reaching into the sky…

KAREN	Ahh…

KAREN	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	Dude!

KAREN	Ahh!

OPHELIA	You lost.

KAREN	Oh, shit.  Shit, shit, shit.  I turned the clock forward, but it…

FREDDY	Wait.  This was all a trick?

KAREN	Freddy, no.

FREDDY	Dude.  Can you help me get my sleeping bag?

FREDDY	London Bridges falling down.  Falling down…  Perfect.  This is perfect…

GIRL	(breath sounds, moaning, etc.)  (screams!)

KILLER	(laughs)

GUY	Dude.  That’s supposed to be scary?

KILLER	What is this?  This is stupid.

GUY	You’re stupid.

KILLER	Sick balls, killer.  C’mon.

GUY	(pain sounds)

KILLER	Woof.

GUY	Now let’s go, we gotta get this on air in less than an hour.

KILLER	And how we gonna do that?

GUY	Don’t worry about it.  I’ll worry about that, okay?  Let’s go.

KILLER	Continue.

GIRL	Ah…

LISA	Hey, what’s up?

OPHELIA	This was on the porch.

LISA	Who left it there?

LISA	I don’t know, but there’s a note…

LISA	‘From the Climax Killer…’

GIRL	(on TV)  (moaning, etc. – continuous)

LISA	I’m surprised they let me leave this bit in.

FREDDY	And fuck (** can’t understand dialog at all)

LISA	(TV voice)  The Climax Killer’s victim, coming and going at the same time.  The police are going over the tapes, now, trying to ascertain the victim’s identity.  They are warning students to be vigilant.  Lock your doors and windows.  (reg. voice)  What if he’s watching this?  What if he’s after me, now?

FREDDY	Oh, god.

OPHELIA	You’re a reporter, Lisa.  You can’t hide from the truth.

JAMES	Lisa, and you’re a great reporter.  I mean, that story has touched me, in places I didn’t even know I had.  I cried.  I laughed.  I…

JOSE	Stop it, man.

FREDDY	This is all bull shit.  There is no Climax Killer.

JAMES	Thanks you.

JOSE	Don’t worry, Lisa.  I won’t let anything bad happen to you.

FREDDY	Well, I’m not sleepin’ outside, again, tonight.  Not again.  I almost froze my balls off last night.

OPHELIA	What a tragedy that woulda been.

JAMES	(light laugh)

LISA	No one’s going anywhere, you guys, not until we catch the Climax Killer.  (breath sounds)

OPHELIA	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

JAMES	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

OPHELIA	(scared sound!)

JAMES	Jesus, Ophelia, I’m better than I thought.  God, this is got to be one of my personal bests.

OPHELIA	There’s someone there.

JAMES	Where?  …  Where?

OPHELIA	I saw someone.  Outside.  A guy.  A big buy with dark eyes!  Haunted eyes!

LISA	Ahh!

FREDDY	What the fuck??

KAREN	Freddy, what the hell happened?

FREDDY	It looks a lot like the power went off.

KAREN	No shit, smart ass.  Now, whatta ya gonna do about it?

FREDDY	The power goes off.  The power goes on.  I’m not its baby-sitter.

LISA	(screams!)  It’s the Climax Killer.  It has to be.  (scared sounds)  

KAREN	Lisa, I think you’re taking this Climax Killer thing a little too seriously.  The whole thing looks fake to me.

OPHELIA	I saw him.  Outside my window.

KAREN/LISA	(screams/crying sounds)

JOSE	Are you okay?

LISA	(screaming/crying)  The Climax Killer’s out there!  I know it.

JOSE	C’mon.

LISA	(crying)  We have to call the cops.

JAMES	Cops?  Say what?

LISA	(crying)  I have to call ‘em.  He’s gonna come out and get us.

OPHELIA	The guy I saw out the window, he’s an escaped killer!  The Climax Killer.

JAMES	Oh.

OPEHLIA	He was right there!  What if he’s still outside?

LISA	(screams!)

JAMES	Um.  I don’t know, I thought it was something serious.  My bad.

KAREN	We’re all gonna die.  (cries)

MIA	I’m sure this is a big misunderstanding.

JANE	Um, hm, yeah, you’re ex-boyfriend wanted you to burn down his trailer.  (fake laugh)

MIA	(light laugh)  Um, I think there’s some room for us, for some legal wiggling there.  C’mon, give me one more chance.  I promise I’ll go straight.

JANE	Mm.  (as in ‘no’)

MIA	But, before I do…

JANE	Look, stop that.  I got work to do, okay?  (whisper)  God…  Mia, stop.

MIA	C’mon, Plain Jane.

JANE	Yup?  I mean, Campus Security…  Oh, uh oh.  Ah…  Climax Killer you say?  …  Oh… oh, no.  Ah, yeah, that’s as far, ah, um!  Really, I, I’m trying’ to understand your concerns, but I… (moans)  I’m gonna come… coming…  (breathing sounds)

MIA	(light moans)

LISA	Okay.  They’re coming.

OPHELIA	Good.  Alright, you guys sit tight.  I’m gonna find the fuse box..

LISA	Okay.

FREDDY	Da, da!…  Da, Da!!

LISA	(screams)

FREDDY	(laughs)

JANE	(moaning)

MIA	Whatta ya doing here, with some maniac out there?  Mm…

JANE	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

MIA	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

JOSE	Lisa, are you okay?

LISA	(weepy)  For my nerves.  Just knowing that he’s out there, somewhere…

JOSE	…  (coughs)  … Don’t worry.  I’ll protect you.

LISA	(weepy)  Makes you think about things, doesn’t it?  That death is maybe just around the corner…  It makes you think about things…  (breath sounds)  I mean, what if I can’t wait.  What if I wait too long.  What if the Climax Killer reaches me before I meet Mr. Right?  I don’t wanna die a virgin.

JOSE	Really?

LISA	I wanna know what it feels like to experience the sensation.  I wanna get laid before I die…  I can’t wait for Mr. Right, forever…

JOSE	Lisa?

LISA	Jose.  Just fuck me.  Fuck me right now…

KAREN	Hey.  About last night.

FREDDY	Forget it.  You won.  I’ve moved on.

KAREN	Freddy, I didn’t mean to.  I really didn’t..

FREDDY	Sure.

KAREN	Well, ya know those poems?  They really touched me.

FREDDY	Do me a favor.

KAREN	Name it.

FREDDY	Don’t tell anybody about those poems, okay?  They would make me look, fruity.

KAREN	I think they make you look like a genuinely nice guy.

FREDDY	Yeah, a genuinely nice gay guy.

KAREN	If that’s what you want, then fine.  I won’t tell anybody.

FREDDY	Yeah, as a matter of fact, I should really be getting’ rid of those poems, right now.

KAREN	Freddy, don’t!

OPHELIA	(softly)  Where is it?  …  (screams!!)  What the hell are you doing?  You scared the shit out of me!

JAMES	C’mon, baby.  I’m just as scared as you are.  I wanna comfort you…  Now, that’s better.

OPHELIA	Help me find the fuse box.

JAMES	Okay…  Sure.

OPHELIA	(light laugh)

JAMES	Mm…

OPHELIA	Mm…

JAMES	Mm…  Okay, hang on.  Hang on…  I think I found it.  (light laugh)  Mm…

OPHELIA	(very light laugh)  Mm…

JAMES	I’m gonna flip the switch.

OPHELIA	Mm…

JAMES	You tell me if anything comes on…

OPHELIA	(screams!!)

JANE	Hello.  Is anyone there?

JANE	They locked us in.

MIA	What did I tell you?  There’s just no helping some people.

OPHELIA	You were supposed to protect me.

JAMES	I, I…  technically, there was not even a verbal agreement.

OPHELIA	Pussy!

JAMES	Are you questioning my masculinity?  

OPHELIA	I’m not questioning it, I’m denying its existence.  Pussy!

JAMES	Okay…  That’s it.

OPHELIA	Where’re you going?

JAMES	To put an end to this, once and for all.

OPHELIA	But he’s in the basement, he’s not in the kitchen.

JAMES	I know that.  You can’t fight evil on an empty stomach, can ya?

OPHELIA	Huh…

KAREN	Freddy…

FREDDY	(sigh sounds)  …

KAREN	Freddy!  Uh.  Please don’t.  Nobody’s ever written a poem for me, before…

FREDDY	I’ve dreamed about this…

KAREN	Mm…  Uh…

FREDDY	Wow, I can’t believe…  whatta ya know…

KAREN	Mm.  Believe me, I’ve been dreaming about this just as much as you have.

FREDDY	(light laugh)  Wow, this is really gonna happen…

KAREN	(moaning, etc. – continuous)  Ah, it’s happening.  Oh my god.  It’s happening…  Ah, it’s happening.  Oh my god, it’s happening.  Ah…

FREDDY	It’s happened…

LISA	Okay, let’s just get it over with before they all come and kill us.

JOSE	You sure about this?

LISA	(a tad drunk sounding)  Jose, c’mon…  Yeah.  Drink up.  Yeah, it does a body good…  Yeah…  Oh, yeah.  (light laughing)  Oh yeah…  Hi…  (light laughing)

JOSE	Lisa…  There’s something I should tell you.

LISA	Hello.  Can it wait?

JOSE	No.  Ah.  I’ve gotta be honest.  Ah, you remember the blind date, right?

LISA	Uh huh.  (light laugh)  Oh yeah.

JOSE	I had to stand and watch all those guys come in here and kiss you, and all that time I’m thinking, she’s makin’ a mistake.  You were looking so badly for Mr. Right, but… he’s right here.  It was me…  I’m the one…

LISA	(slight snoring sounds)

OPHELIA	You look like Robo-cop’s retarded brother.

JAMES	C’mon.

OPHELIA	Ah, you’re not going down there, not dressed like that.

JAMES	Pussy, huh?

OPHELIA	Alright, I’m sorry.  I was wrong.  You’re not a pussy.  You’re an idiot.

JAMES	Look, if I’m not back in 5 minutes, you can have my CD collection.

OPHELIA	But, what if the killer’s really down there?

JAMES	Then he’s about to meet his maker.

OPHELIA	Whatta ya going to do, spoon him to death?

JAMES	Poke (or pork??) you, Climax Killer?

OPHELIA	James, what if we have to do some cooking?

JAMES	Would you just get the door for me, please…?

JOSE	Excuse me?

DELIVERY MAN	Hey, are you gonna sign for this or not?  I’ve been out here all night.

JOSE	Why didn’t you knock?

DELIVERY MAN	Shit.  I shoulda known.  Rookie mistake.

JOSE	Who’s it for?

DELIVERY MAN	Um.  James Tyler.

JOSE	That’s fine.  I’ll take it for him.

DELIVERY MAN	Good.

JOSE	Thanks…  Have a good day.

JOSE	(whispers)  Ophelia.  Ophelia.  

OPHELIA	Mm…

JOSE	It’s morning…  Hey, I think your stalker was trying to deliver this to James.

OPHELIA	Hill’s Brothers Jewelers?  Aren’t they…?

JOSE	Yeah.  Yeah.  The biggest wedding ring store in the country.  You can’t get away from seeing their ads on TV…  Okay, here it is.  I think you should give it to him, he’ll open it and he’ll give it right back to you.  (very, very light laugh)

FREDDY	How could you?  You ungrateful, good-for-nothing bastard.

KAREN	Freddy, are you okay?

FREDDY	I’m gonna get an erection, if, if it kills me.

KAREN	Don’t worry about it.

FREDDY	Don’t worry about it?

KAREN	Really, Freddy, it’s okay.  We’ll try again some other day.

FREDDY	But what about the Climax Killer?

KAREN	The power came back on this morning.

MAN	(TV voice)  And to recap, there was no Climax Killer.  Sources have claimed that the hoax perpetrated by the Alpha Beta’s will cost the university over a million dollars.  Way to go, guys.

MIA	(light moaning)

OPHELIA	Whatta ya doing?

JAMES	I’m just watching.  This stuff’s better than Cinemax.

OPHELIA	This came for you.

JAMES	It did?  … Oh…

BOTH	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

LISA	(wake-up sounds)  … Jose?  … Oh…

LISA	Jose…  Jose!  …  It was you.  (light laughing)  It was you.

JOSE	It was always me.

LISA	(very light laugh)

LISA	(very softly)  … Oh my god.  Jose.  This is what it feels like…  Oh my god…  It’s so beautiful.  Oh, oh, oh my god.  Don’t stop…  Never stop…  Kiss me…  (moaning, oh my god’s, etc. – continuous)  Oh my god.  Don’t ever stop.  (screams)  Oh, my god!  What was that?  Oh my god.  Mm, Jose…  Oh my god…
