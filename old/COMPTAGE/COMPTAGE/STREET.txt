JAMES	Did they bring my guitar?

VAL	Nice to see you, too.

JAMES	Sorry, I'm not exactly myself this morning.

VAL	That's a matter of opinion.

VAL	They brought it to me.

JAMES	To you?

VAL	Well, it isn't our first time at this circus, is it?

JAMES	I'm sorry.

JAMES	I know I made a mistake. I messed up.

VAL	Tell me something I haven't already heard 20 times today.

VAL	Good.

VAL	I so much prefer the sound of silence to bullshit.

VAL	How do you feel?

JAMES	Like death.

JAMES	Like, look at me, I'm...

JAMES	It's horrible.

VAL	Turns out you've also got hepatitis.

VAL	Congratulations.

VAL	Ever wonder why you see so many old alkies, but never junkies?

JAMES	You're all full of good news this morning, aren't you?

VAL	You can't mix heroin with methadone.

VAL	You OD. You know this stuff.

JAMES	Yeah.

VAL	Do it again, and you'll probably die.

JAMES	I know. Look, I...

JAMES	I'm sorry...

VAL	Silence over bullshit.

VAL	Right.


VAL	I'll see you when you're discharged.

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Hi. 

VAL	What did you do, nick an orderly's uniform?

JAMES	No, I didn't nick it.

JAMES	A nurse gave it to me because they lost my Tshirt.

VAL	Right.

VAL	You know the drill. Sign that one...

VAL	and take that one to the chemist every day for your methadone.

VAL	Check in with me every two weeks.

VAL	And addicts who stop the methadone treatment and go back to heroin...

VAL	have a higher percentage of ODing.

JAMES	Yeah, I know this already.

VAL	It's my job to tell you. Fall off the methadone...

VAL	and it's more likely you'll OD the next time you do heroin.

VAL	And you could well die.

JAMES	Yeah.

VAL	Is there anyone I can call?

VAL	Any relative anywhere?

JAMES	I'm kind of solo these days.

VAL	No word from your dad?

VAL	Or mum?

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	"Get lost."

JAMES	I guess that's two words.

VAL	Here you go.

JAMES	Thank you.

VAL	You're gonna play something for me?

JAMES	You wanna hear me sing?

VAL	Are you any good?

JAMES	Okay.

JAMES SINGING	You once asked me how long

JAMES SINGING	It takes to mend a broken heart

JAMES SINGING	But it's like a river's song

JAMES SINGING	It never really ends or starts

JAMES SINGING	Some days you go out And you don't come back

JAMES SINGING	You come back as someoe new

JAMES SINGING	And all the pain and all the hurt

JAMES SINGING	And all the lonely nights

JAMES SINGING	Well, it's all a part of you

MAN ON STREET	Here you are, mate.

JAMES SINGING	Some people, they don't mean To bring you down

JAMES SINGING	Sometimes, they got a good heart

JAMES SINGING	Well, I know that two good people can

JAMES SINGING	Be two good people apart

VAL	I wouldn't be begging you if it wasn't a special case.

LOCAL HOUSING OFFICER	Special?

LOCAL HOUSING OFFICER	I've got three single mums waiting for a spot.

LOCAL HOUSING OFFICER	I've got a sweet old pensioner who's getting kicked out of his son's house.

LOCAL HOUSING OFFICER	They all need emergency housing. They're all special.

VAL	Please.

LOCAL HOUSING OFFICER	What's so special about a drug addict? Why this one?

VAL	I don't know.

VAL	Every now and then, one comes along...

VAL	and you just know they have it in them to be clean.

VAL	I think this is his last shot.

VAL	He really wants to be clean, but he's got nothing.

VAL	No support system at all.

VAL	I have to get him off the street, or I'm gonna lose him.

LOCAL HOUSING OFFICER	I'm not giving a spot to a user.

VAL	He's in the program.

LOCAL HOUSING OFFICER	He falls off his methadone, he's out. Period.

VAL	He won't.

VAL	I hope.

BETTY	Come on, everybody.

BETTY	Come on, then. Albert, this side.

JAMES	Val?

THEN VAL	Hey. Come in.

JAMES	Wow.

VAL	Welcome home.

VAL

JAMES	You okay? Yeah.

VAL	It was a little bit stuffy, so I just opened a window.

JAMES	Hot water.

VAL	Look, I've gotta run.

VAL	Keys.

JAMES	Right, yeah.

JAMES	Val, I...

VAL	You're welcome.

VAL	And I put some cereal in the kitchen and milk in the fridge.

JAMES	I don't know what to say.

JAMES	I've got a weapon here!

JAMES	I'm seriously armed!

JAMES	That was you making all that noise?

JAMES	How did you get...

JAMES	I see.

JAMES	You're a thief, are you?

JAMES	Stealing all my corn flakes?

JAMES	Hey, are you friendly?

JAMES	Guess that answers that.

JAMES	No. Come on. This way.

JAMES	There you go.

JAMES	They're better with a bit of milk, actually.

JAMES	I'm gonna get this out.

JAMES	You're not a very good thief, by the way.

JAMES	Next time, try and be a bit quieter.

JAMES	That's the trick, I hear. Come on.

JAMES	Up you come. Look.

JAMES	Look at that.

JAMES	There's gonna be a family worried about you.

JAMES	You better go home now.

JAMES	No, no, no.

JAMES	This way.

JAMES	I know. But I think it's time, you'd better go home.

JAMES	Hey, no, this way. There you go.

JAMES	Go on. Go out there.

JAMES	That's it. Go on.

JAMES	No, don't look at me like that, okay?

JAMES	All right, then.

JAMES	One night, okay?

JAMES	And then I'm gonna take you back to your owner.

JAMES	Yeah, deal?

JAMES SINGING	Some days you go out And you don't come back

JAMES SINGING	You come back as someone new

JAMES SINGING	And all the pain and all the hurt

JAMES SINGING	And all the lonely nights

JAMES SINGING	Well, it's all a part of you

JAMES SINGING	All that really matters Is you don't stop trying


JAMES SINGING	All that really matters Is you don't stop trying

JAMES SINGING	Don't give up

JAMES	There you go.

JAMES	I'll see you in the morning, okay?

JAMES	Over there?

JAMES SINGING	And, oh...

JAMES SINGING	Grind it all to dust And all the rest?

TUBE STATION GUARD	Not you again. Oi!

TUBE STATION GUARD	Come on, on your way.

JAMES	Don't do this, mate.

TUBE STATION GUARD	You know the rules. You're causing an obstruction.

JAMES	I'm just trying to make a living here. I'm not in anyone's way.

TUBE STATION GUARD	It's an health and safety issue.

TUBE STATION GUARD	If you stand there, you're obstructing the exit.

JAMES	Well, if you stand there, you're obstructing the exit.

TUBE STATION GUARD	One toot on this, mate, they'll haul you away.

JACK	Again?

JAMES	It won't be like last time. I've got my own flat now, and everything.

HILARY	Jack.

JACK	You remember Hilary.

JAMES	Hi.

HILARY	We're late, darling.

HILARY	I'm sorry, we've got to...

JAMES	We were just chatting about Christmas, actually.

JAMES	Family and all that.

JAMES	Coming together.

JAMES	Christmas dinner. Right, Dad?

HILARY	I wish we'd known.

HILARY	Unfortunately, our table's full.

JAMES	Always room for one more at Christmas.

JAMES	Right?

JACK	Don't you think, darling? Maybe one more would...

HILARY	What, in our house? We'll have children there.

JACK	What's that supposed to mean?

HILARY	Jack, we're late. Come on.

JAMES	I'm not contagious, you know.

JACK	Take this.

JAMES	No, I don't want your money.

JACK	Here.

JACK	Maybe...

JACK	Maybe New Year's, okay?

JACK	Darling. Hold up.

JACK	Hey, wait up.

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Hey, mate.

JAMES	Hey, boy.

JAMES	It's okay.

JAMES	It's okay.

JAMES	You're hurt.

JAMES	What have you been doing today?

JAMES	Have you been in a fight?

JAMES	Is it okay if I take you and try and find your owner?

JAMES	Is that okay?

JAMES	It's okay.

JAMES	Here, down here?

JAMES	Excuse me. Do you know whose cat this is?

JAMES	Wait, I have a hurt cat here.

JAMES	It's you, with the dogs.

JAMES	Yeah, it's just in there.

BETTY	What did you do to it?

JAMES	Me? I didn't do anything. I just found him over there.

BETTY	Don't just stand there.

JAMES	It's all right.

BETTY	It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

JAMES	There you go.

BETTY	There we go.

BETTY	Yeah, it might be purulent.

JAMES	It might be what?

BETTY	The wound.

BETTY	He needs antibiotics before it's infected.

BETTY	Maybe they can glue it together. He needs a vet.

JAMES	That sounds expensive.

BETTY	Can you put a price on love?

JAMES	No, no. He's not my cat.

JAMES	I just found him. I think he's a stray or...

JAMES	I don't know.

BETTY	He is telling me he was put here to be with you.

BETTY	Reading his spirit loud and clear.

BETTY	He came to you for a reason.

JAMES	Really? You're sensing that?

BETTY	Of course not. What do I look like, some kind of nut?

BETTY	There's a card there for the vet that I volunteer at.

BETTY	It's a charity.

BETTY	Tell them Betty sent you.

JAMES	Okay, thanks.

BETTY	And you are?

JAMES	Me? I'm James.

JAMES	James Bowen.

BETTY	I don't believe in last names. Patriarchal burdens.

BETTY	I gotta go. I've got dogs to walk.

JAMES	Right, yeah.

JAMES	Okay, mate. It's all right.

JAMES	Are you okay?

BETTY	Yeah. Allergic. Animals.

BETTY	Ironic, huh?

JAMES	Yeah.

BETTY	You should go.

BETTY	Bacteria's multiplying by the second...

BETTY	and Bob needs a vet.

JAMES	Bob?

BETTY	That's what he told me he wants you to call him.

JAMES	It's okay.

JAMES	He's not actually my cat, you know.

BETTY	Mine, yours. We all belong to each other.

BETTY	See you, Bob!

JAMES	It was nice to meet you.
JAMES	You're a bit of an attention hog.

JAMES	Do you know that, Bob?

JAMES	It's okay. I got you.

JAMES	Hi there.

JAMES	I just found this cat, and he's hurt himself.

VET RECEPTIONIST	A stray?

JAMES	I don't know.

VET RECEPTIONIST	Are you asking us to put him down?

JAMES	What? No.

VET RECEPTIONIST	Do you know how many stray cats there are in London?

VET RECEPTIONIST	It's an epidemic.

JAMES	Well, he's got a name. It's Bob.


JAMES	And the wound, it's purulent.

VET RECEPTIONIST	Take a number.

VET RECEPTIONIST	It's gonna be a long wait.

JAMES	I've gotta be somewhere.

JAMES	Can't I drop him off and come back?

VET RECEPTIONIST	Does this look like a drycleaner's?

JAMES	Okay, okay.

JAMES	It's okay, it's okay.

JAMES	It's okay.

JAMES	Look.

JAMES	It's a rabbit.

JAMES	No, no, no.

JAMES	Don't look at the rabbit. The rabbit's not for dinner, okay?

JAMES	Don't worry about him, Bob. It's okay.

JAMES	Bob, look, it's the month of the cat.

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	That's the kind of hat for you, isn't it?

JAMES	Look at Tiffany.

JAMES	She looks cute.

JAMES	Who's that? Look at that one.

JAMES	Lucky. Look at Lucky.

JAMES	Doesn't look so lucky, does he?

JAMES	I've missed my appointment. Val's gonna kill me. 

JAMES	I can't miss rushhour busking, too. I've gotta go, all right?

JAMES	I'll have to come back tomorrow.

VET RECEPTIONIST	Number 62 is up.

JAMES	It's okay. It's okay. 

VET ASSISTANT	Hi.

VET	He did great.

JAMES	You okay?

JAMES	Yeah? Come on, then, mister. In you get.

JAMES	That's it. Good boy.

VET ASSISTANT	And you get your pills from the front desk.


JAMES	Okay.

VET RECEPTIONIST	22 pounds.

JAMES	What? I thought she said this place was free.

VET RECEPTIONIST	Not the drugs.

JAMES	Sorry, mate.

JAMES	Hang on.

JAMES	That's all I've got. Come on, he's really sick.

JAMES	All right, wait.

JAMES	This is my food money for the next week.

VET RECEPTIONIST	It's up to you.

JAMES	Right. Come on, Bob.

JAMES	Time for your medicine.

JAMES	This is gonna make you feel better.

JAMES	Look, what's that? Yeah, exactly.

JAMES	All right, ready?

JAMES	Open wide.

JAMES	No, no, no, no. Come here.

JAMES	Bob, look.

JAMES	Yeah. Just down the hatch, mate.

JAMES	Oi. Come back here, mister.

JAMES	Come here.

JAMES	Come here.

JAMES	Oi.

JAMES	No, Bob.

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Right. Okay.

JAMES	Bob. Treat.

JAMES	Right, mister.

JAMES	Let's try this again.
JAMES	Twice a day for two weeks, they said.

JAMES	No, come here.

JAMES	All right.
JAMES	No, no, no. Stay here, stay here.

JAMES	Stay here. Bob, Bob, Bob.

JAMES	Oi! Come here, come here.

JAMES	Wait, come here.

JAMES	Look, what's that? What's that? What's that?

JAMES	What's that? What's that?

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	It's all right, mate. It's okay.

BETTY	I know.

JAMES	I swear he wasn't like this earlier.

BETTY	Well, I've had practice.

BETTY	Did they tell you to bring him back in a couple of weeks?

BETTY	Yeah, that'll be a good time to get him snipped.

JAMES	"Snipped"?

BETTY	Yeah, the man parts.

JAMES	But, I mean...

BETTY	Please, it isn't a big deal.

JAMES	It's easy for you to say. Besides, he's not even mine. 

BETTY	An intact male alone on the streets, it's the worst life imaginable.

BETTY	They fight for food, they fight for territory.

JAMES	Don't need to imagine that, do we?

BETTY	If you can't give him a home, at least give him the chance to stay alive.

BETTY	Now, ordinarily, I don't touch meat...

BETTY	but Bob's gonna need some protein.

BETTY	What do you do?

BETTY	How did you end up here?

JAMES	Me?

BETTY	Well, I know what he does.

JAMES	What have you got there?

BETTY	Allergy pill.

JAMES	Right. I thought...

BETTY	Otherwise, I am 100% antidrug.

BETTY	Lot of addicts in here.

BETTY	I steer clear.

BETTY	So, what do you do? How did you end up here?

JAMES	I'm a musician.

JAMES	I write songs and play.

BETTY	Yeah?

JAMES	I haven't exactly been discovered yet...

JAMES	but I just moved in here, which is good.

BETTY	From... Australia.

JAMES	I've actually been back a while.

JAMES	I've been sort of in between places...

JAMES	I guess you could say.

JAMES	But no, I got taken out of there when I was a kid when my parents split up.

JAMES	And my mum took me out there, and Dad stayed here.

JAMES	He had his business to run...

JAMES	and didn't like flying, apparently.

BETTY	And you?

JAMES	Well...

JAMES	she bought me a kitten, actually.

JAMES	Dad, kitten. Kitten, Dad.

BETTY	You must have missed him.

JAMES	My dad?

JAMES	It's a long story.

JAMES	Long story, eh?

JAMES	Val, I'm so sorry I missed our time.

JAMES	Honestly, I tried to get there. There were things...

JAMES	There was this cat, right?

VAL	We have an agreement. You miss your appointment, you're out of the program.


JAMES	And I met this girl, Betty.

VAL	I'm waiting for the part that explains why you missed our appointment.

VAL	Is that blood on your coat?

JAMES	Must be Bob's.

VAL	Who's Bob?

JAMES	Bob's my cat I'm telling you about.

JAMES	Well, not really mine.

VAL	Betty's?

JAMES	No.

JAMES	Betty's allergic.

JAMES	But she told me to take him to the vet.

VAL	You seem a little rattled.

JAMES	I'm trying to explain to you why I missed our appointment.

JAMES	Bob was hurt. He needed a vet.

JAMES	It took forever.

VAL	How'd you pay for the vet?

JAMES	My dad gave me some money.

VAL	You saw your dad?

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Bumped into him.

JAMES	It didn't go very well.

VAL	This Betty...

VAL	does she use?

JAMES	No.

VAL	I put myself on the line for you.

JAMES	I know.

VAL	Did you tell her you're in the program?

JAMES	I told her I was a musician.

VAL	So you didn't tell her the truth.

VAL	Well...

VAL	you've covered a lot of ground since I last saw you.

VAL	You can't take on too much too fast.

JAMES	Because I'm an emotional wreck?

VAL	Because feelings aren't an addict's friend.

VAL	Bad, good, any feelings.

VAL	When was the last time you were totally sober?

VAL	No weed, no brown, nothing.

JAMES	When my parents split up, and I was...

VAL	You just couldn't deal with your emotions.

VAL	Emotions are still dangerous.


VAL	It's baby steps, James.

VAL	You're not ready for a relationship.

JAMES	Another one?

JAMES	You wanna go up high? Wanna go up high?

JAMES	Go on, Bob.

JAMES	Good boy.

JAMES	You've got your strength back.

BETTY	Hey.

BETTY	Here he is.

JAMES	Look at your collar.

JAMES	Look at you. You're like Shakespeare or something.

BETTY	He's a little drowsy,but the castration went well.

JAMES	Please, don't even say the word.

JAMES	I think he understands English.

BETTY	Here you go.

JAMES	It's okay. Does he hurt down there?

BETTY	You big wally.

BETTY	Do you know how many cats we castrate every...

BETTY	Perform the procedure on?

BETTY

BOB	He won't even remember. Will you, Bob?

JAMES	I don't know about that.

JAMES	I was thinking, is he too thin?

BETTY	You're keeping him, aren't you?

JAMES	Well, I'd like to...

JAMES	but I can't. It wouldn't be fair to him, would it?

JAMES	Keep him cooped up all day?

JAMES	He's a street cat.

BETTY	His weight's fine. He should be good to go in a week.

JAMES	Okay.

JAMES	Thank you.

JAMES	Oi. I know, I know.

JAMES	No, don't look at me like that.


JAMES	It's for your own good.

JAMES	Hey.

JAMES	It wasn't my idea. You can take it up with Betty.

JAMES	Okay, look.

JAMES	I'll take that off if you promise not to lick the stitches.

JAMES	Okay?

JAMES	Right. No, it's okay.

JAMES	Now, you hold still there, okay?

JAMES	Okay, Bob.

JAMES	Let me just take this off. Okay, that's it.

JAMES	That is a good boy. Okay, here we go.

JAMES	There you go.

JAMES	Hey, look at this.

JAMES	Come on.

JAMES	See, there you go.

JAMES	Yeah, I'm your hero now.

JAMES	You wait till you realise you've got no bits left.

JAMES	Morning, mate.

JAMES	No, no, no, Bob!

JAMES	Bob, Bob, Bob. No.

JAMES	Naughty.

JAMES	Do I not feed you enough?

JAMES	You only eat what I give you, yeah?

JAMES	Not the neighbours.

JAMES	And you...

JAMES	don't come back.

JAMES	No, look, Bob...

JAMES	Bob.

JAMES	I've gotta go to work, all right?

JAMES	I can't take care of you.

JAMES	I wish I could...

JAMES	but I can't.

JAMES	Look at the big world out there...

JAMES	waiting for you.

JAMES	Go and explore it.

JAMES	That's it. Good boy.

JAMES	So long, Bob.

JAMES	Come on. This is silly now.

JAMES	What did I just say? You're gonna get yourself run over.

JAMES	Hey, it's not safe out here.

JAMES	I mean it.

JAMES	You can't come with me.

JAMES	Seriously, you'd be surprised how much he understands.

JAMES	Hey, Bob.

JAMES	Go on, go back to the grass.

JAMES	Go on. Good boy.

JAMES	Good boy.

WOMAN ON BUS #1	Darling, look.

JAMES	What are you doing here?

JAMES	No, don't go over there.

JAMES	He's not even my cat. He's just followed me onto the bus.

JAMES	Haven't you, eh?

BUS CONDUCTRESS	Isn't he lovely?

JAMES	Is it okay that he's on here?

BUS CONDUCTRESS	I don't know. Have you paid for him?

BETTY	My parents didn't call.

BETTY	They drove up and told me.

BETTY	My brother was everything to me.

BETTY	Protector, teacher.

BETTY	He was the best painter I ever knew.

JAMES	This was your...

JAMES	your brother's place.

BETTY	He died right back there in the bathroom...

BETTY	needle still in his arm.
BETTY	28.

JAMES	So why did you...

BETTY	Move in here?

BETTY	To be near him.

BETTY	He tried...

BETTY	so hard, to get clean.

BETTY	But I guess that he didn't want it enough.

BETTY	Or could want it enough.

BETTY	But he couldn't do it...

BETTY	not even for me.

JAMES	I thought you wanted clean.

VAL	I do. God, of course I do.

JAMES	Then why not now?

JAMES	I'm ready to come off the methadone.

VAL	It's a process, James.

VAL	It's my job to manage the process with you.

JAMES	I'm down to 10 ml.

VAL	Let's revisit this after the holidays.

VAL	God knows they're hard enough as it is.

VAL	Hey, you're doing great.

JAMES	I just, I want...

JAMES	I wanna be clean.

JAMES	I want to live a life, you know?

JAMES	This kid I knew, Baz...

JAMES	he...

JAMES	He OD'd. He died.

JAMES	And I don't wanna go that way.

VAL	I know.

VAL	After the holidays.

JAMES	Yeah?

VAL	Look, I've got another appointment.

JAMES	Okay.

JAMES	Hey, no.

JAMES	Come on.

VAL	What are you doing for Christmas?

JAMES	Betty said she'd spend it with me...

JAMES	as long as I promised not to mention the words "Christmas" or "merry" in any order.

VAL	My kind of girl.

BETTY	Ho, ho, ho! Happy Catsmas!

JAMES	What's all this?

BETTY	Happy Catsmas, Bob. New girlfriend for you.

BETTY	This is Bobina.

JAMES	He's not impressed.

BETTY	I'm sorry.

BETTY	He will. Just playing hard to get.

JAMES	Don't panic, by the way. This isn't a youknowwhat tree.

JAMES	No, it's a lamp tree.

BETTY	Taste like turkey?

JAMES	Not even vaguely.

BETTY	It does!

JAMES	Tastes like rubber.

BETTY	No, it doesn't!

JAMES	It's nice, but what I think is that...

JAMES	if you're gonna eat tofu...

JAMES	why pretend it's turkey or burgers or whatever?

JAMES	It's like giving tofu an inferiority complex.

JAMES	Let it be who it wants to be.

JAMES	"I am tofu.

JAMES	"I am inedible."

BETTY	It's not inedible!

JAMES	No.

BETTY	Give it to Bob to try. He's a better judge than you.

JAMES	Bob. What's that?

JAMES	What's that?

JAMES	Num nums?

JAMES	I think we'll take that as a "no."
BETTY	Wow!

BETTY	I love it!

JAMES	Yeah?

BETTY	Thank you.

JAMES	Right, so I'll read this to you, mate.

JAMES	Look.

JAMES	"Dear James and Boblet...

JAMES	It's your fault! It's that dog! I've got a cat in here!
VAL	CCTV proved it wasn't your fault.

VAL	But you're prohibited from busking for six months.

JAMES	I said where's Bob?

VAL	Maybe you can focus.

VAL	You can't go back to Covent Garden. You're banned from busking.

JAMES	I wanna know where my cat is!

VAL	You missed your meds, didn't you?

JAMES	I just wanna know where Bob is.

VAL	We can go and get him right now.

VAL	You got yourself arrested, and you didn't get your methadone.

VAL	James.

VAL	You are so close.

VAL	Don't lose it now.

JAMES	It wasn't my fault, none of this.

JAMES	It wasn't my fault.

VAL	Look, I'm gonna call the chemist, authorize them to give you the methadone...

VAL	even though you missed it yesterday.

VAL	You go straight there. I'll get Bob.

VAL	Okay?

JAMES	Hello.

PHARMACIST	Sign.
	
JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Come on, man.

JAMES	Let me explain!

BETTY	What's to explain? I have eyes, James.

BETTY	You're an addict. You lied to me!

JAMES	No, I didn't!

JAMES	I just shaded the truth a little.

BETTY	Oh, please!

JAMES	Wait, look...

JAMES	yeah, I'm on the methadone program...

JAMES	but I haven't used for three months. Believe me.

JAMES	I am trying to get clean.

BETTY	I can't be around addicts. I told you that.

BETTY	It's just, it's too much...

BETTY	I can't do it. And I wasn't shading the truth.

JAMES	This dog came after Bob, and I was trying to protect him.

JAMES	And then this whole fight broke out.

JAMES	And then I got arrested.

JAMES	I wasn't doing anything wrong. It wasn't my fault.

JAMES	But now I can't busk. And if I do, then I'll get arrested again.

JAMES	And then...

JAMES	I don't know what will even happen to Bob.

BETTY	If you can't sing, then you can't make any money.

BETTY	And if you do sing, then you'll get arrested.

BETTY	And all you're thinking about is what happens to the cat!

KELLY	When you sell our magazine, you get out what you put in. 

KELLY	You know how they say weed is a gateway drug? 

JAMES	Yeah, I'm a little familiar with the concept.

KELLY	Well, The Big Issue is a gateway opportunity.

KELLY	I'll start you off with a handful of free ones.

KELLY	Just like a pusher, right?

KELLY	You sell them, the next ones you buy from us.

KELLY	Sell those, make a little profit...

KELLY	buy even more.

KELLY	So you gotta plan.

KELLY	And you get one designated territory. Get it?

KELLY	Poach on anyone else, and you're done.

KELLY	James, you knew the rules.

JAMES	I wasn't selling...

KELLY	One month, no papers.

JAMES	Come on! Don't do this to me. I wasn't selling, I promise you.

JAMES	There was this one couple that came up.

GEOFF	You saw what happened.
	
GEOFF	So they forced you to sell to them, did they?

JAMES	I wasn't trying to...


GEOFF	Look, you're taking business off me.

JAMES	Why are you making this up? Why are you picking on me?

KELLY	Enough. Enough.

KELLY	One month, no papers.

JAMES	What?

BETTY	Nothing.

BETTY	Just the chaos.

JAMES	Chaos around drug addicts?

JAMES	Where life's a constant shit storm...

JAMES	that kind of chaos?

JAMES	Bob, put the frog down.

JAMES	Leave it.

JAMES SINGING	I see you in the headlights

JAMES SINGING	I see you in the headlights

JAMES SINGING	A city built on aspiration

JAMES SINGING	All summed up in a quotation

JAMES SINGING	Somewhere on the avenue

JAMES SINGING	Life is good And good for you

JAMES SINGING	Circle of a spotlight

JAMES SINGING	Silhouette against the dark night

JAMES SINGING	Everybody wants to make it

JAMES	I'll leave that one. That's for the tuna.

JAMES SINGING	Any chance, you gotta take it

JAMES	Come on.

JAMES	There you go.

JAMES	You need this more than me.

JAMES SINGING	Broken hearts walk two by two

JAMES SINGING	Forgotten dreams sing lonesome blues

JAMES	Thank you.

JAMES	Come on, Bob.

JAMES SINGING	In the shadow of a twilight

JAMES SINGING	Stars get lost in the night sky

JAMES SINGING	Loneliness and isolation


JAMES SINGING	Hidden deep in the foundation

JAMES SINGING	Somewhere on the avenue

JAMES SINGING	Life is good And good for you

JAMES SINGING	Somewhere on the avenue
JAMES SINGING	Life is good for you

JAMES	Mate, there's nothing there.

JAMES	It's empty, mate.

JAMES	Bob...

JAMES	Bob, stop it.

JAMES	Give it a rest, mate. Come on.

JAMES	Bob.

JAMES	Stop it!

JAMES	I'm sorry.

JAMES	I'm sorry.

JAMES	I know. I know you're hungry, buddy.

JAMES	I'm sorry.

JAMES	I'll find a way, okay?

JAMES	I'll find a way.

JAMES SINGING	Broken hearts walk two by two

JAMES SINGING	Forgotten dreams sing lonesome blues

BETTY	James. What are you doing?

JAMES	Betty. Hi. I'm just...

BETTY	Wait, you've been banned from busking.

JAMES	Well, Bob's hungry, I'm hungry...

BETTY	If you get arrested, you're not gonna be able to feed Bob.

JAMES	They're not gonna arrest me, not here.

BETTY	What, do you think you're just above the rules?

BETTY	Like they don't apply to you? God, so typical.

JAMES	Typical of what, Betty?

BETTY	Stop it.

JAMES	No, go on, say it. Let them hear.

BETTY	Stop it.

JAMES	What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to eat?


BETTY	I don't know. I don't know.

JAMES	What do you want me to do...

JAMES	just erase the last 20 years of my life and start over?

BETTY	I don't know!

JAMES	I would if I could.

BETTY	Do you know who shouts like this in public?

BETTY	Junkies do.

BETTY	And the people who fall in love with them, that's who.

BETTY	I can't do this again.

KELLY	I didn't like it any more than you.

KELLY	Those are the rules.

KELLY	Welcome back.

JAMES	Thank you.

KELLY	James.

KELLY	Watch yourself, okay?

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Big Issue!

JAMES	Give it a try! Help Bob and I!

JAMES	Big Issue. Come on.

JAMES	Yes, mate.

JAMES	Thank you very much.

RICH WOMAN	He's adorable.

JAMES	This is Bob. You wanna say hello?

JAMES	Say hello.

GRAHAM	Hi!

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Care for a Big Issue, madam?

RICH WOMAN	Oh, yes.

RICH WOMAN	Actually, we came to see the cat.

JAMES	Oh, yeah?

RICH WOMAN	Yes, Graham can't stop talking about him.

JAMES	He's beautiful, isn't he?


GRAHAM	Where's he from? I found him.

JAMES	Do you like Bob?

JAMES	£2.50, please.

JAMES	He's my best mate.

RICH WOMAN	You want the best for him...

RICH WOMAN	all of that.

JAMES	Thank you very much. Yeah, of course.

RICH WOMAN	Actually, what I mean is, I'd be willing to take him.

RICH WOMAN	To buy him.

JAMES	He's not for sale.

RICH WOMAN	Look, obviously, this isn't the best environment for an animal...

RICH WOMAN	living on the street and all that.

RICH WOMAN	Yes, all right, darling.

JAMES	We've got a flat.

RICH WOMAN	And we'd be able to give him all the things that you can't...

RICH WOMAN	like a decent home.

JAMES	He's not for sale.

RICH WOMAN	I'm sure you could use the cash. How much do you want?

JAMES	No, I don't want your money. How about how much for your kid?

JAMES	I'll trade you.

JAMES	I'll give him a decent home.

RICH WOMAN	How dare you. That's exceptionally rude.

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Come back!

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Bob!

KELVIN'S OWNER	Thank you so much.

JAMES	Excuse me, did you see a cat come in here?

JAMES	A ginger cat? No?

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Bob.

JAMES	Come on, mate. Where are you?

JAMES	Bob.

JAMES	Bob.

JAMES	What if a dog got him? Or a car, or...

JAMES	I can't...

JAMES	It's been two nights, you know.

VAL	Look, I'm not saying this is it...

VAL	but maybe Bob did what he was meant to do.

VAL	He's a cat. Cats are independent animals.

JAMES	It's my own stupid fault.

JAMES	I wasn't watching him.

JAMES	I promised I'd take care of him...

JAMES	but I wasn't watching him.

VAL	This isn't a time you wanna be on your own.

VAL	What about your dad, or Betty?

JAMES	No, I need to...

JAMES	I need to get home. I need to wait for him there.

JAMES	Maybe he'll come back.

VAL	I really think you should have someone with you.

JAMES	He might come back, mightn't he?

VAL	He might do, yeah.

JAMES	He could come home, couldn't he?

VAL	James.

MARY	I know these two.

MARY	I used to see them all the time when he was singing.

DANIELLE	But look at this.

DANIELLE	This guy and his cat are all over YouTube.


DANIELLE	Look at the hits.

DANIELLE	Over a million.

DANIELLE	They're on Instagram.

DANIELLE	And Facebook.

MARY	That is so cute.

MARY	Look at that.

DANIELLE	Incredible.

MARY	So, you're thinking a book?

DRUG DEALER	You looking for paradise?

DRUG DEALER	Because I've got it all here.

DRUG DEALER	White... 

DRUG DEALER	brown, whatever you like.

JAMES	I want my cat.

JAMES	I'm looking for a ginger cat.

JAMES	Have you seen it anywhere?

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Hey.

JAMES	Hey, mister.

JAMES	Where have you been, hey?

JAMES	Where have you been?

JAMES	Bob.

JAMES	Where have you been?

JAMES	I'm ready.

VAL	I think you are, too.

VAL	It's about weathering the tests, James.

VAL	"Can I do it straight?" That's always an addict's question.

VAL	Think of the worst flu you've ever had.

VAL	Multiply that by a hundred.

VAL	Do you know what "riding the bike" is?

VAL	It's when you can't keep your legs still even when you're lying down.

VAL	For a week, every day will be a fight.

VAL	Every hour, a struggle not to go out and score.

VAL	It's harder coming off methadone than kicking heroin.

VAL	You can't do it on your own.

JAMES	I'm not.

JAMES	I've got him. He got me this far.

JAMES	The other day, we were out selling papers...

JAMES	and this guy came up to us.

JAMES	Really welldressed...

JAMES	the sort that wouldn't wanna share the pavement with me before.

JAMES	He called me "sir."

JAMES	"Sir, do you mind if I take your picture?"

JAMES	No one's ever called me "sir" before.

JAMES	And it's because of Bob.

JAMES	He's shown me what life could be like...

JAMES	on the other side.

JAMES	Betty?

JAMES	I know you're in there.

JAMES	I just wanted to say you're not gonna see me for a few days.

JAMES	Val's given me the goahead.

JAMES	So I'm doing it.

JAMES	I'm sorry that I've disappointed you.

JAMES	After all this...

JAMES	I'll make it up to you.

JAMES	I'll make it up to everyone I ever knew.

JAMES	I just wanted to let you know.

BETTY	You're gonna need food, a stockpile...

BETTY	because any excuse to go outside, and you're gonna try and score.

BETTY	Let me bring you the food. Then lock the door.

JAMES	Tofu?

BETTY	I'll make an exception this once.

JAMES	Okay.

JAMES	But that's all.

JAMES	I don't want you to see me like that.

BETTY	And I've got Bob.

BETTY	He'll look after me.

JAMES	Bob!

JAMES	Hey.

JAMES	Hey, mister.

VAL	I'm proud of you, James.

VAL	So, what are you gonna do now?

JAMES	Well, first thing...

JAMES	I'm gonna try and find a way to thank you.

VAL	Come here.

JAMES	All right, come on, mister.

JAMES	Let's go. Come on.

JAMES	Yeah.

VAL	You take care of yourself.

JAMES	And you.

JAMES	Thanks, Val.

JAMES	Come on, mate.

MOVER #1	Coming.

MOVER #1	Yeah, that one too.

MOVER #1	I'll go in, yeah?

MOVER #2	Wanna give us a hand with this?

MOVER #2	Ready.

BETTY	Sorry, I don't know why the door was shut...

BETTY	Hi.

JAMES	Hi.

BETTY	Look at you.

BETTY	You did it.

JAMES	Yeah, just.

BETTY	You look great.

JAMES	Thanks.

BETTY	How do you feel?

JAMES	Yeah...

JAMES	now I feel good.

JAMES	Same...


JAMES	but totally different.

JAMES	What's going on? You're moving.

BETTY	Yeah.

BETTY	I'm going home for a while.

JAMES	Right.

BETTY	I can't stay here.

BETTY	It's not my life.

BETTY	It was my brother's...

BETTY	and I need to move on.

BETTY	You actually helped me see that.

JAMES	Good.

BETTY	Yeah.

BETTY	It doesn't necessarily mean goodbye.

JAMES	No.

BETTY	Wait.

BETTY	For you.

BETTY	I made this one.

BETTY	You just have to hang it over...

JAMES	Yeah, I know what these are.

JAMES	Thank you.

BETTY	That's my address.

BETTY	It's my parents' address. That's where I'll be staying.

JAMEs	Elizabeth Robinson.

BETTY	It's my real name.

JAMES	Hello, reality.

BETTY	My number's on there, too...

BETTY	in case you need me.

BETTY	Until we meet again.

BETTY	There was a guy hanging around...

BETTY	who wanted to give you this.

BETTY	He asked me to make sure you got it.

BETTY	Literary agency.

JAMES	Right.

BETTY	Say hi to Bob.

JAMES	I will do.

JAMES	Good luck.

BETTY	Yeah, you too.

JAMES AND BETTY	Bye.

MARY	We were thinking a book, for starters.

MARY	We'd like to team you up with a ghostwriter.

DANIELLE	He'll help you tell your story.

DANIELLE	Sorry, stories.

DANIELLE	We think it would make a great book.

MARY	Or a series of books.

MARY	The important thing is...

MARY	we need to get hold of you.

JAMES	I don't actually have a phone currently.

MARY	Okay.

MARY	We can sort that. Should we get one for Bob?

JAMES	I think we can share.

JAMES	Looks like he wants to write it, though.

JACK	What are you...

JAMES	I'm clean, Dad.

JACK	"Clean" as, what, like...

JAMES	Everything.

JAMES	I just wanted you to know.

JAMES	You know, I was...

JAMES	I was thinking while I was standing here just now...

JAMES	the last time I wasn't high in front of you...

JAMES	I was 11.

JAMES	Before Australia.

JAMES	I wanted to apologise.

JAMES	For everything.

JAMES	I don't blame you for giving up on me.

JAMES	No, Dad, I don't want your money.

JACK	I didn't give up on you.

JACK	I was ashamed...

JACK	of myself.

JACK	I was never afraid to fly.

JACK	I just didn't know how to do...

JACK	I didn't know how to be your father.

JACK	I'm the one who needs to apologise.

JAMES	No...

HILARY	Jack, what are you doing out there?

JACK	I'm talking to my son.

JACK	And my grandson.

JAMES	Got him on a lead, don't worry.

JAMES	Wait till you see the screensaver.

JAMES	Look at that.

JAMES	Yeah?

JAMES	Where'd they go?

JAMES	How are you doing in the deep blue sea there, Bob?

JAMES	Hey, come on.

JAMES	I've gotta get this bloke Gary a load of notes.

JAMES	Stop fishing.

JAMES	Morning, monster.

JAMES	Hello, mate.

JAMES	Caught any fish yet?

JAMES	How is a guy, who's spent a third of his life checked out, to write a book?

JAMES	Come on, Bob, help me out here.

JAMES	I'm stuck.

JAMES	Bob.

JAMES	Bob!

CAT ENTHUSIAST	I just loved it.

CAT ENTHUSIAST	Every word.

JAMES	Thank you.

CAT ENTHUSIAST	Thank you.

MARY	James, we're about to start.

BETTY	Not before you say hi to your biggest fan.

JAMES	Betty.

BETTY	I'm so proud of you.

JAMES	Hi.

JAMES	Thanks for coming.

MARY	James.

MARY	James.

JAMES	Yeah.

MARY	Bob.

JAMES	Okay.

MARY	Off you go.

JAMES	Okay, Bob.

PHOTOGRAPHER	Great, thank you.

MARY	Ready?

JAMES	Yeah.

VAL	Good luck.

JAMES	Thank you.

VAL	Hey, Bob.

JAMES	Hey, Dad.

JACK	Son.

JACK	It's all a bit overwhelming.

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	He's got your scarf.

BUS CONDUCTRESS	I told you he wasn't a stray.

MARY	Bob, you good?

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Go on, Bob. Highfive.

JAMES	Good boy.

JAMES	Hi, everyone.

JAMES	Didn't expect there to be so many people here.

JAMES	I could make some joke about there not being enough room to swing a cat...

JAMES	but I don't think Bob would like that.

JAMES	A friend helped me with this.

JAMES	And when I was stuck, her advice was...

JAMES	start by mentioning that everyone gets a second chance.

JAMES	But that not everyone manages to take them.

JAMES	Luckily for me...

JAMES	I had some very important companions...

JAMES	to help with my second chance.

JAMES	And then she said...

JAMES	to just tell the truth.

JAMES	And that's what I've done.

FEMALE FAN AT READING #1	Absolutely loved it, mate. Well done.

JAMES	Thank you.

JAMES	Little paw print there.

FEMALE FAN AT READING #2	Thank you so much.

JAMES	Here you go.

JAMES TO MALE FAN AT READING #1	You enjoy that?

MALE FAN AT READING #1	Felt like I lived every moment.

JAMES TO MALE FAN AT READING #1	Good.

FEMALE FAN AT READING #3	Hi.

JAMES	Keep it going. That's great.

JAMES	Now you guys.

JAMES	Beautiful! That's great. Now, the basses.

JAMES	Come on, get low.

JAMES	All together!

JAMES	That's it, beautiful!

JAMES	We'll break it down now.

JAMES SINGING	Satellite moments

JAMES SINGING	They light up the sky

JAMES SINGING	Satellite moments

JAMES SINGING	Are just passing by

JAMES SINGING	Satellite moments

JAMES	Yeah! Give yourself a round of applause!

JAMES	Yes, brother. Yes, mate.

JAMES	Nice one, dude.

CROWD	Bob the cat, eh?
