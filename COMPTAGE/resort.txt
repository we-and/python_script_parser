SECURITY GUY 1	Hello? Anybody down here?

SECURITY GUY 2	(screams)

SECURITY GUY 1	(screams)

SECURITY GUY 2	(laughs)

SECURITY GUY 1	That’s it. I quit. You almost gave me another heart attack.

SECURITY GUY 2	Could’ve seen the look on your face. You’re such a pussy.

SECURITY GUY 1	You freaking dick.

SECURITY GUY 1	Dude, you ever pull that… [DOOR CREAKING THEN CLOSING]

FEMALE	Hello? Hello? 

SECURITY GUY 1	What the fuck was that?

SECURITY GUY 2	It sounds like a bunch of fucking kids screaming.

SECURITY GUY 2	Shit.

SECURITY GUY 1	Dude, your breath.

SECURITY GUY 2	(screams)

SAM	Surprise!

CHRIS	Surprise!

BREE	Surprise!

LEX	You guys! First a birthday trip to Hawaii and now this! It’s too much!

BREE	Hi, I’m extra.  Nice to meet you.

LEX	I’m regretting giving you my spare keys.

SAM	Sure. I mean we all got a lot of packing to do but might as well cram

SAM	this in.

CHRIS	All right, come on, birthday girl. Blow out your candles.

LEX	Thank you.

MALE	She calmed down once we told her she wasn’t on the island anymore, she was air vac’d off and all.

DET. PETERSON	Got it. Can I speak with her?

MALE	She should be fine now. You know the deal, just let me know if she start to lose it.

DET. PETERSON	Okay. I’m Detective Peterson, Maui PD.  I’m here to figure out what happened to you last night.

DET. PETERSON	And I’m to understand that you had a traumatic experience on Kilahuna Island. The local found you in disarray

DET. PETERSON	on a road wandering, barely conscious.

DET. PETERSON	I also understand that you’re not traveling alone. You’re here with three friends?

SAM	And then she goes maybe you’d be more comfortable

SAM	with your shirt off.

SAM	And I was like ma’am, 

SAM	with all due respect, 

SAM	that’s exactly why I became a pool boy.

LEX	(laughs)

CHRIS	Wow, what is your life?

SAM	Uh, it’s like uh, uh, and a little bit of uh.

LEX	Okay.

BREE	Seriously now?

CHRIS	Hey, I’m just living vicariously, okay?

BREE	God, I’m starting to feel like if we go on vacation with these d-bags, we’ll end up coming home in body bags.

SAM	Oh, does that mean you’re out? Because I could call the old lady.

CHRIS	(laughs)

BREE	Yeah, right, ‘cause she’s real.

LEX	Oh. 

BREE	(laughs)

LEX	Guys, I literally can’t get over this.  

LEX	Oh, I would say pinch me but I don’t know where Sam’s hands had been.

SAM	Oh, you know.

LEX	That’s disgusting. (laughs) Oh, god.

BREE	I don’t wanna know.  No, you-you deserve this.

CHRIS	Good god.

BREE	Besides, how else are you gonna finish your book?

CHRIS	Yeah, and Stephen King says the devil’s in the details.  So, we had to make sure you get the lay of the land.

SAM	You don’t even read.

LEX	This is perfect timing. I… though I just finished the draft and I was thinking on the next pass I want it to just be a little more specific. So, I know nobody can go 

LEX	to the actual resort. But just being there in

LEX	Hawaii is gonna be really… why is everyone being so weird.

BREE	Okay, um, well, we actually have another surprise for you.

LEX	Guh…

CHRIS	We found someone willing to take us to the island.

LEX	That’s impossible. No, since the resort got shut down, the entire island just been restricted. The locals literally won’t even say its name.

CHRIS	Well, say its name, girl.

SAM	Kilahuna Island. Kilahuna, Kilahuna, Kilahuna, Kilahuna.

BREE	Pack your garlic. Pack roll and butter. We’re

BREE	going paranormal.

SAM	[CLAPPING]

LEX	I-I think-I don’t even know what to say.

DET. PETERSON	Police that responded to the scene

DET. PETERSON	found this. Is this your phone?

DET. PETERSON	Ms. Sanders, if they’re in danger, I’ve got men…

LEX	They’re still on the island.

DET. PETERSON	Who? Your friends?

DET. PETERSON	Ms. Sanders, I understand this is difficult to talk about. But if your friends are in danger, we need to help…

LEX	I can’t help them.

DET. PETERSON	I don’t understand.

LEX	They’re dead.

DET. PETERSON	Dead. How? Did somebody do this to you?

LEX	She did.

DET. PETERSON	Who is she?

LEX	The half-faced girl.

LEX	Oh, my god. I’m gonna be able to get real pictures for the pitch deck, you guys.

LEX	Based on true events, the first people to set foot

LEX	in the resort since its forced

LEX	shutdown.

BREE	Yes, mama, sell that shit.

SAM	Pause. Let me get this straight. I know the resort is supposedly haunted but you’re telling me that no one’s even been to the island?

BREE	Aw, Sam, are-are you scared? Are you afraid the boogeyman’s gonna get you?

SAM	(scoffs) Boogeyman’s not real.

LEX	Yeah, but it’s not the boogeyman that you have to be scared of.

SAM	No?

LEX	Like you said, the boogeyman’s not real.

SAM	Well, what is it then?

BREE	Why don’t you show him the YouTube videos you sent me?

CHRIS	Oh, yeah, that-that shit’s terrifying.

LEX	Okay, let’s-let’s set the mood first.

SAM	Oh.

FEMALE	Hello, and welcome to this week’s episode of Paranormal PI.

FEMALE	Today, we travel to Hawaii to try to separate fact from fiction. Now Hawaii is no stranger to hauntings.  And they have a wide-ranging mythos for paranormal investigators to explore.

FEMALE	In this episode, we focus on one in particular, the haunting of a now abandoned resort on Kilahuna Island.

MALE	The Hawaiian Islands are filled with supernatural 

MALE	occurrences. One island and the structure that 

MALE	resides on it, Kilahuna Island, is home to a 

MALE	once breathtaking resort that now sits abandoned

MALE	And is now closed off from the rest of the world due to a series

MALE	of bizarre and inexplicable events.

MALE	The locals consider the land sacred due to the tribal

MALE	battles held there in the past, leaving it cursed by the blood of war.

MALE	Built in the early ‘90s, the resort was

MALE	intended to be a magnet for tourism but shortly after opening

MALE	it became overwhelmed by reports of aggressive hauntings.

MALE	What you are seeing is the last known video of the resort including some modern 

MALE	grown footage.

MALE	We do not know who filmed or uploaded the footage.

MALE	One room in particular

MALE	was notorious for hosting terrifying events, Room 306.

MALE	Guests that have had the misfortune of staying

MALE	in this room have reported a wide array of paranormal

MALE	activity. Some visitors experienced 

MALE	hearing voices, flashing

MALE	Lights and writing on the mirror after exiting the shower.

MALE	The hotel staff began refusing to service 306.

MALE	leading to the hotel closing the room

MALE	altogether. Amongst all hauntings, 

MALE	at the resort, one spirit has a reputation that is feared more than any other, a ghost the locals call the Half-Faced Girl.

MALE	The story goes that the Half-Faced Girl

MALE	was a local villager who attacked

MALE	and killed on the island.

MALE	She was brutally strangled to death with a jump rope and left for dead in the jungle.  The animals 

MALE	feasting on her corpse.

MALE	Those responsible for the attack were

MALE	thought to be tourists staying at the resort.

MALE	But no suspects were ever charged. The locals say 

MALE	The half-faced girl still roams the island and

MALE	the resort, looking for her perpetrators to enact an eternal justice.

MALE	From the sightings stem disappearances. The locals believe 

MALE	the Half-Faced Girl had taken them 

MALE	and their souls to wander the island with her for eternity. After only two years 

MALE	of being open, the resort was eventually shut down and closed to all visitors. 

MALE	The only known access to the island 

MALE	Is a small boat that ferries

MALE	locals once a day. The locals maintain their side of the island and employ a 

MALE	small security force to prevent trespassing.

MALE	and perhaps further investigation into these events and the stories of Kilahuna and the resort

MALE	true. With locals refusing to help anyone make their way across the island to the resort, the mystery may never be

MALE	put to rest.

SAM	Oh, great. Now I really wanna go there.
 
BREE	(scoffs)

CHRIS	I’m sure it’s just the same old folklore as every other place.

LEX	I mean there are always practical explanations but not at Kilahuna.  Dozens of unexplained disappearances have occurred at that resort and the locals swear by the existence of the Half-Faced Girl.

BREE	You know, my aunt also thinks that you’ll catch a cold if you leave the house with your hair wet.

SAM	That’s because you will catch a cold if you leave the house with your hair wet.

BREE	That’s not what I meant.  It’s-it’s a superstition. Right, Lex?

LEX	There’s only one way to find out.

SAM	We have to find

SAM	The Half-Faced Girl. I only got half a face.

BREE	Get those off. Ew, that’s the grossest thing ever.

SAM	I’m still down to go.

DET. PETERSON	The legend of the Half-Faced Girl?

DET. PETERSON	Haven’t heard that one in a while.

LEX	It’s not a legend. Have you ever been to that island?

DET. PETERSON	Yeah, once, when I was young. I remember the rumors. And I remember the resort and I remember how they closed the resort down because of those rumors.

LEX	It should’ve never been built. 

DET. PETERSON	Well, I could see how it’d make for a great book. I mean heck, it scared the bejeezus out of me when I was a kid.

DET. PETERSON	Let’s focus

DET. PETERSON	Back on what happened to you once you arrived in Hawaii. You mind if I record it? Paperwork.

LEX	It was beautiful.

LEX	Do you guys have room for one more?

CHRIS	Let’s go

CHRIS	girl.

LEX	The rental car situation could’ve been a little better but…

CHRIS	What’s wrong with the rental car?

BREE	It’s huge.

CHRIS	What’s wrong with huge?

SAM	Yeah, I mean it was the last one they had. I get it. Swimmers’ bodies better than meaty.

CHRIS	Right.

SAM	You know.

BREE	I want it but gee…

BREE	That would’ve been such a cute Instagram photo.

SAM	And always one more.

LEX	How far are we from the resort?

CHRIS	It’s close.

SAM	We just have to island hop first.


LEX	Island hop?

BREE	It was supposed to be a surprise.

BREE	Surprise!

SAM	Surprise!

LEX	Nobody said anything about a helicopter.

SAM	Because we need to complain about it.

LEX	I-I’m just not gonna do that.

SAM	See?

BREE	Lex, it’s the only helicopter company that can take us to the other island.

LEX	I mean isn’t there a boat we can take?

CHRIS	There’s only one boat today and we already missed it and this is cheaper.

BREE	It’s gonna be fun.

SAM	Yeah.

PILOT	You guys ready to fly? Go.

CHRIS	Okay.

BREE	Okay. 

CHRIS	Maybe we should’ve took the boat.

SAM	Saddle up, soldiers. Let’s go hunting, Lex.

CHRIS	(laughs)

PILOT (ON RADIO)	Maui Tower

PILOT (ON RADIO)	Heli niner whisky hotel east ramp, ready to go with lima, departure to the east.

PILOT	I hope this thing still takes off (laughs). Just-just kidding.

SAM	You are missing out, Lex.

SAM	Open your eyes.

CHRIS	So what’s the deal with the resort? Is it real?

PILOT	Uh, I heard 

PILOT	the stories.

CHRIS	So, it’s real.

PILOT	No, I think the stories are bullshit.

SAM	See? You know I like them.

CHRIS	How many people live on the island?

PILOT	Well, just a few on the south side, not too many on the resort side, you know, since they stopped maintaining the road.

BREE	Have you been there?

PILOT	No.

PILOT	I don’t care to go to places like that.

LEX	How do you know it’s not haunted?

PILOT	I never said it wasn’t.

PILOT	There’s a few ways to get to this waterfall you’re trying to hike to.

PILOT	You need to stay on the trail.

PILOT	Do not go anywhere the signs say

PILOT	shouldn’t go to.

PILOT	You don’t wanna get trapped in a flash flood out here. There’s no one to help and there’s no cell phone reception.

PILOT	Now, there’s

PILOT	one boat that leaves tonight if

PILOT	you wanna get off this island.

PILOT	And that happens at 7:00 PM. Do not miss that

PILOT	boat.

BREE	Okay.

BREE	I’m gonna set my alarm so we don’t miss

BREE	it.

SAM	Wait, you’re-you’re not taking us back?

LEX	Thank God.

PILOT	No, did this captain say anything

PILOT	about a trip home? Okay? So…

PILOT	Have fun, guys.

LEX	Thanks.

PILOT	You’re welcome.

LEX	(laughs)

SAM	Great, he left us for dead.

BREE	Sam, why do you always have to say stuff like that?

CHRIS	Let’s just go. We only have about six hours.

SAM	Only six hours.

BREE	You know, I think I was born

BREE	to be an island girl. Can we all move here?

LEX	Stupid (whispers).

SAM	I can never live here.

BREE	Why? It’s beautiful.

SAM	Cause I need people and things to do.

BREE	Well, you can literally do anything here.  You could go to the beach. You could go surfing or hiking or...

SAM	Yeah, no, uh, couldn’t do it because I need strip clubs.

BREE	Really? Strip clubs?

SAM	I love strip clubs.

LEX	Thank you by the way.

CHRIS	For what?

LEX	What you did.

CHRIS	What did I do?

LEX	Bringing me here.

CHRIS	It was all of our idea.

LEX	Yeah, but, um, Bree may have mentioned that you paid for my ticket.

CHRIS	I just know how much you like this place.

LEX	I really appreciate it.

CHRIS	You’re welcome.

SAM	I am literally already out of breath.

LEX	I think that’s probably the alcohol talking.

SAM	Super original. You should write that in your next book.

LEX	You should be so lucky to buy everything I’ll write, Sam.

SAM	I know, I don’t wanna be in anything you write if it involves ghosts. Seriously, why do you-why do you believe?
BREE	See that?

LEX	Like you really wanna hear my explanation?

CHRIS	Yeah, but (indistinct chatter)

BREE	Really? You (indistinct chatter).

SAM	I do, seriously.

LEX	Okay.  First of all, if there isn’t some other dimension, then how do you explain that almost every religion since the origin of the human species believes in the afterlife?

LEX	And on top of that, they talk about some way of communicating with deceased ancestors or deities. Like what about –what about praying and celebrating holidays like Dia De Los Muertos, Shamans?

SAM	Okay.

SAM	Okay, okay, I think, I think that people make up stories, how the earth was created, how humans evolved, why we’re here. Because those stories, they-they give people something to believe in, right? Which makes people-makes people feel better and most of the time that translating to them behaving better. The Bible, the Quran, cave walls, all these like religious writings, they all promise us this beautiful afterlife. 

LEX	(makes noise)

SAM	Because it makes people feel better. They need something to believe in hence the stories. 

SAM	I could be wrong.

LEX	Okay.

LEX	So you believe that because

LEX	people need to believe, it all is fake.

SAM	Yeah.

LEX	All right. What about all of the photographic evidence of apparitions that we have?

SAM	Fake.

LEX	Poltergeist occurrences where there are multiple eyewitnesses.

SAM	Bullshit.

LEX	My grandmother’s spirit visiting me the night that she died.

SAM	Definitely fake. Are you serious?

LEX	I know it sounds stupid but it happened. When I was younger, we didn’t really talk to my grandparents very much and I was doing my homework one night in my room and I noticed that in the corner, there she was just sitting in the chair. I mean she wasn’t solid but I can totally make her out. I could see her face. And she smiled at me. She looked straight into my eyes and she didn’t have to say anything but I just knew it was gonna be okay.

LEX	And then she was gone. So, I told my mom and she gave me the exact look that you’re giving me now.

SAM	I am listening.

LEX	That I was crazy.

LEX	But then the next month we got a call and she passed away. So, I looked it up, okay? I looked it up and it turns out that there are a lot of accounts where people, relatives, spirits visit them in between when they leave this earth and they enter another place.

CHRIS	I’m gonna post these instantly.

LEX	I don’t know, I could be wrong but…

SAM	I can’t argue with that story.

BREE	Oh, that’s so funny.

LEX	Great, now which way?

SAM	Uh…

BREE	Oh.

BREE	There’s a map.

BREE	Okay, we’re here.

CHRIS	No, we’re here.

BREE	No, we’re not.

CHRIS	Bree.

CHRIS	Which way is north?

BREE	Is that a thing

BREE	people know?

CHRIS	(laughs) It’s exactly what I thought.

SAM	And now we’re lost.

CHRIS	No, wait, wait.

CHRIS	We’re not lost. Look.

CHRIS	We made it here on the beach. We took this trail to there. And now we’re just somewhere in there.

BREE	Exactly.

BREE	So, we should go to the waterfalls.

LEX	What? No, guys. We have to go to the resort.

LEX	Okay, that

LEX	trail is 

LEX	not on that map. But it looks like it goes pretty much directly there.

BREE	Lex, it’s your birthday. And I need pictures.

SAM	Don’t… do not say it.

SAM	Don’t say it.

BREE	Gram. I need pictures for my Instagram.

SAM	She knows I hate that. I hate the world for

SAM	creating that word.

LEX	Okay.

SAM	But I’m down for the naked swim.

BREE	Let’s just go for a little bit.

CHRIS	Yeah, we don’t know where this trail’s gonna take us but we do know

CHRIS	We can get there from the waterfall.

LEX	Or

LEX	we could take the shortcut to the resort.

BREE	Okay.

BREE	Who votes waterfall?

SAM	I vote yes.

LEX	So stupid.

BREE	Okay, let’s go.

CHRIS	Yep.

LEX	Guys, it’s

LEX	my birthday. Shouldn’t I have some sort of say in what we do?

CHRIS	Happy birthday.

SAM	Happy birthday.

BREE	Happy birthday.

SAM	It’s amazing, dude.  Go and get naked.

CHRIS	After you.

SAM	(laughs)

LEX	(indistinct chatter)

BREE	Hurry up, it’s cold.

CHRIS	I think the water feels so good.

BREE	No.

SAM	Oh, yeah, so go on, man.

CHRIS	What, dude?

BREE	Lex, come on. (screams)

BREE	(laughs) Lex, get in.

LEX	I’m okay.

LEX	We really should get going, guys.

BREE	Come on.

CHRIS	Come on, let’s live a little.

LEX	I hate you all.

SAM	Come on. Get in here.

LEX	Don’t watch me.

BREE	(makes noise)

CHRIS	(makes noise)

LEX	Turn around. (laughs)

LEX	That was the last time I felt truly safe.

LEX	That was the last time it felt peaceful.

LEX	You know, the way that trip was supposed to be.

LEX	But if I had been paying attention, I would’ve noticed it. Something was off.

LEX	Something was around us.

DET. PETERSON	And what was that?

LEX	The island, the island was trying to tell us to leave.

DET. PETERSON	The island.

LEX	I know you don’t believe me and it’s fine.  You don’t have to.

DET. PETERSON	It’s not that I don’t believe you. I’m just trying to figure out what’s happening here so I can help your friends.

LEX	You’ll just think that I’m crazy.

DET. PETERSON	Alexandra, I can promise you I won’t think you’re crazy. I (sighs), did you run into anybody? Did you see anything

DET. PETERSON	out of the ordinary?

BREE	Does it smell weird?

SAM	Yeah, it just kind of smells like tequila.

SAM	I think it spilled all over in the bag.

BREE	That’s totally disgusting. No, I’m good. Tequila ham.

LEX	Yeah. Yeah. (laughs)

SAM	I just can’t eat.

LEX	Oh, no, you just say that ‘cause you’re so scared of all the ghosts you’re gonna see, huh?

SAM	So many ghosts on the island.

LEX	I know you’re afraid

SAM	I know. They’re everywhere.

LEX	(laughs)

BREE	What do you believe, Chris?

CHRIS	Well, I mean I believe there could be ghosts, yeah.

SAM	Dude.

SAM	Come on.

CHRIS	What?

CHRIS	I mean granted I’ve never had an experience, yeah, but it doesn’t mean I can’t see both sides.

SAM	Well, I have. 

BREE	Bullshit.

LEX	Yeah then

LEX	what was that painful monologue earlier about not believing?

SAM	You guys wanna know something I never told you?

SAM	I was really religious growing up. I grew up in a Christian house. Uh, we went to church every Sunday. We did the whole thing. And one night I woke up and I couldn’t move. 

SAM	I could feel like this-this presence on top of me.

SAM	Like an evil spirit. And it was terrifying. So, I prayed and I prayed. And finally I could move again. 

BREE	I feel like there’s a but coming.

SAM	But in college I learned about sleep paralysis which basically is 

SAM	when you’re sleeping, your body goes into this... it paralyzes itself so you don’t go act out your dreams. When that doesn’t work right, you wake up in a dream state feeling paralyzed. People feel fear. They hear things. They see things. So, what’s more likely? Demon?
 
SAM	Demon to a 12-year-old’s room, demon to people’s elbow, 

SAM	held them down for a couple minutes or just a little sleep paralysis? Again, I-I-I could be wrong.

BREE	You know, you keep saying that you could be wrong. Is that because you know you are?

SAM	Oh.

LEX	Ooh.

SAM	Well, what do you believe?

BREE	Well, I feel like if there’s a God then there has to be an evil and so if you believe in like goodness then there has to be stuff like demons and spirits and-and negative things. So, I don’t really know. Mm-hmm. Are you mad?

SAM	No.

SAM	I just got to drain the lizard.

CHRIS	(laughs)

LEX	He’s so dramatic.

BREE	I know.

BREE	I know. I think he’s mad.

SAM	Chris.

BREE	Um, um, more than a hundred, millions.

LEX	(laughs) That’s a lot.

CHRIS	(laughs)

SAM	Come here.

SAM	Hurry up, dude.

SAM	Hurry.

CHRIS	What the…?

CHRIS	Stay with the girls. I’ll check it out.

SAM	Yeah.

BREE	Who’s that?

SAM	Shh.

LEX	Chris, be careful.
CHRIS	Guys, it’s just a sheet.

LEX	(laughs)

BREE	(laughs)

SAM	(makes noise) Fuck that. I actually thought someone was standing there.

LEX	Wow, you scare me pretty 

LEX	easily.

BREE	He’s all talk.

SAM	No.

LEX	(laughs)

SAM	No, you all…

SAM	That just further proves my point. You all saw someone standing there, right?

LEX	Okay.

SAM	Okay.

BREE	Guys, let’s leave.

BREE	Let’s keep going.

CHRIS	Yeah.

LEX	(laughs) Oh.

CHRIS	Yeah, we’ve about four hours ‘til the boat leaves so I think if we head that way the map says there’s a lookout point. Let’s just go over there. Let’s check it out, come on.

LEX	Okay.

BREE	True stories, I just like…

LEX	Terrible, yeah, trash.

CHRIS	Are the worst.

CHRIS	I think that’s the top of the hill right there.

BREE	Wait, stop.

SAM	Bree, it wasn’t a ghost.

BREE	No, I’m saying there’s a cell phone tower right there and I don’t have service.

SAM	Bree.

LEX	Bree, that’s not a cell phone tower. 

CHRIS	Yeah, it’s a radio tower. And I doubt it works. It’s probably been here since Pearl Harbor days.

SAM	Oh, Pearl Harbor? I’m a huge Michael Bay fan.

LEX	What are you doing?

SAM	I’m gonna climb it.

SAM	Bet we could see

SAM	the resort from here.

CHRIS	I wouldn’t touch it.

SAM	You think it’s still active?

SAM	(screams)

BREE	Sam.

SAM	Oh, my nipples are so

SAM	hard. (screams)

BREE	Sam.

SAM	(laughs)

SAM 	(laughs)

SAM	I got you.

BREE	Why would you do that?

SAM	Oh, my god, I got you. You… you actually care

SAM	about me.

BREE	You’re such an idiot.

SAM	Guys, she cares about me.

CHRIS	That was pretty good.

SAM	It’s pretty good.

SAM	Oh.

SAM	Anybody want some?

LEX	No.

BREE	No.

SAM	Okay.

LEX	That’s got to be it.

BREE	That’s so far.

CHRIS	Looks like a half mile

LEX	Yeah, we can do that. We just have to 

LEX	hurry.

SAM	Can we stay up here and enjoy the view first?

LEX	No.

BREE	No.

SAM	Okay.

SAM	Fuck me.

CHRIS	Great, now what?

SAM	Looks like we got a fence to climb.

BREE	(sighs)

LEX	Oh, you guys, over here.

SAM	(sighs) Okay. Oh, you’re gonna rip it. Oh, damn, girl. 

LEX	(laughs)

SAM	God, good for you.

LEX	I mean I work out.

SAM	I don’t get it.

BREE	What?

SAM	They had to have spent a fortune building this place. 

SAM	And what, they just let it go to rot?

CHRIS	‘Because it’s haunted, Sam.


SAM	Yeah.

BREE	I’ve never seen anything like this before.

LEX (OS/ON)	Oh, my gosh, you guys, look at the difference.

SAM	Whoa.

BREE	So pretty.

SAM	Yeah, looks

SAM	great.

LEX	This is so perfect for my story. I have to film it.

BREE	So, who’s going first?

CHRIS	I’ll go.

CHRIS	Or Lex will go first.

SAM	Keep out.

SAM	Hello?

CHRIS	Jesus, Sam.

LEX	Hello.

CHRIS	Guys, stop.

LEX	What?

CHRIS	You’re bringing attention to ourselves.

LEX	There’s no one here. Relax. 

SAM	So much for Hawaii scares resort, no ghosts, all stories.

LEX	It’s not like we’re at the zoo. They’re not just gonna be on display, Sam.

SAM	(makes noise)

BREE	What’s with all the white sheets?

LEX	I don’t know. Maybe they were doing construction or something.

SAM	Yeah.

SAM	Whoa.

CHRIS	Sam, what the fuck, man?

SAM	I’d always wanted to do that.

BREE	Sam,

BREE	you can’t just start breaking stuff.

SAM	Why not?

CHRIS	Sam!

SAM	That’s it.

CHRIS	God, man, I think you got enough to drink.

SAM	(makes noise) You might actually be right (laughs).

CHRIS	That’s a hell of a drop.

SAM	Yep.

LEX	Okay, should we go check out the room?

CHRIS	306?

LEX	Yeah. What, are you scared of that, too?

SAM	Oh, they got one of those old thingamajigs.

BREE	It’s called a bell cart, genius.

SAM	Ghostrider whip.

CHRIS	Sam, you’re an idiot.

SAM	Oh, you don’t get it.

CHRIS	What, that you’re an idiot?

SAM	Ghost. All right.

CHRIS	Luckily it’s just here.

SAM	Probably was.

BREE	Don’t say that. It’s stupid.

SAM	I’m gonna go explore downstairs first.

CHRIS	By yourself. Are you crazy?

SAM	I’m literally just right down here.

BREE	Come on up. Maybe a ghost will get him first.

CHRIS	Can only hope.

LEX	Hey, this is the third floor.

CHRIS	Uh, this place is creepy.

SAM	Guys, way better down here.

BREE	Wait, stop, I wanna take a picture.

SAM	Oh, wait, wait, wait, let me get ready.

CHRIS	(laughs)

BREE	Worst butt.

SAM	You used to like it. She definitely liked it.

CHRIS	Smells like Sam’s ass. Somebody definitely died in here.

BREE	Wait, so what happened in here again?

LEX	This is the place with the-the lights used to flicker. And

LEX	and people heard voices

CHRIS	Yeah, and they reported seeing writing

CHRIS	in here with the-the two showers.

LEX	Shit.

SAM	How’s the view?

LEX	You’re standing in the pool.

SAM	Yeah. It’s filled with dirt. 

BREE	Wow.

BREE	What a view.

BREE	Sam, you should come up here.

SAM	You know, this place is fucking massive.

SAM	Got to be some ghosts

LEX	Should we look at the bathroom?

CHRIS	What do you think happened in here?

LEX	I don’t know. Could you imagine taking a shower and coming out to see writing in the mirror? I mean you would think somebody was playing a joke on you.

BREE	I’d be more scared of the voices.

CHRIS	Yeah, fuck that.

BREE	Oh, wait, this is the room that the bellman wouldn’t come in.

CHRIS	Yeah.

BREE	You know, Sam better not come scare us right now.

SAM	You know what? Could you take a picture of me with the mirror in the background?

CHRIS	Of course.

LEX	Nothing especially
LEX	odd happened in Room 306. I was just taking photos of what I thought was important for my

LEX	story.

DET. PETERSON	So you did take photos inside the resort.

LEX	Yes. Why?

DET. PETERSON	Well, 

DET. PETERSON	your phone, there’s no photos inside the resort. They stopped upon your arrival.

LEX	So, any of the rooms or Room 306...?

DET. PETERSON	No.

DET. PETERSON	Is there something on this thing?

LEX	Before we left Room 306, that’s...

LEX	That’s when it happened.

CHRIS	Oh, shit.

BREE	What?

CHRIS	You look amazing.

BREE	Get a room.

CHRIS	(laughs)

LEX	Can you take another one, babe? My backpack looks stupid.

BREE	What is that?

CHRIS	That doesn’t sound good.

LEX	Yeah, wait, what is… what is that?

CHRIS	Sam’s probably torturing some animals.

LEX	Chris, you’ve got to see this.

BREE	That was so weird.

SAM	The fuck was that?

CHRIS	I don’t know, man. 

BREE	Wow, of course we come when it’s the

BREE	full moon.

CHRIS	Yeah, well, at least we have some 

CHRIS	light on the hike back.

BREE	Yeah, well, we should probably go home.

LEX	Wait, what? I mean we just got here.

BREE	Yeah, but I don’t wanna miss the boat.

CHRIS	Yeah, Lex, come on. We all wanna see something but it’s at least in our hike back and we’ll be here all week. Just come back tomorrow.

BREE	And pay for another helicopter ride? No.

CHRIS	It’s already 5:45.

LEX	Yeah, so we have a little bit of time. We brought flashlights, right? We wouldn’t’ do that if we weren’t planning on being here at night.

CHRIS	Yeah, for the hike back.

BREE	Sam, we’re leaving.

SAM	We just got here.

LEX	Right? Guys, come on.

LEX	Well, this sucks.

LEX	I really need something for my story.

BREE	I know. I’m sorry.

SAM	(sighs) Maybe we’ll see a ghost back at the house.

LEX	We have more time, guys.

CHRIS	Not if we stay here. The darker it gets, the more dangerous it’s gonna be on the hike back.

LEX	Dangerous? What do you think is gonna happen? Somebody’s gonna die? We have flashlights.

BREE	Oh, cut…

CHRIS	Whoa.

LEX	Do you think yours is big enough, Sam?

SAM	It can never be big enough.

BREE	That’s what she…

SAM	That’s what she said.

LEX	You’ve been carrying that in your bag the whole day.

SAM	Yep. It’s my travel light.

BREE	Your travel light.

SAM	Guys, the weather is getting really weird.

LEX	Yeah.

BREE	Are you guys sure this is where we came in at?

CHRIS	Yeah, this is where we entered. I remember that road over there.

SAM	I don’t.

BREE	Yeah, I-I don’t think this is right.

CHRIS	Trust me, this is where we entered.

LEX	I think it was back there.

SAM	No, we didn’t walk that far when we came in.

CHRIS	It’s around here somewhere.

SAM	It’s a giant hole. I think we’d see it if we’re close to it.

CHRIS	You know what then? Screw it. Let’s just dig.

SAM	You’re gonna dig.

CHRIS	Do you have a better idea?

SAM	It’s a fence. It’s a fence. They keep us from going through.

CHRIS	Well, until you come up with a better idea, this is what I’m gonna do.

BREE	Why don’t we just

BREE	find the hole that we came through?

LEX	You guys, where is my backpack?

BREE	Did you leave it?

LEX	No. I… No, I had it… I had it in the room where we were taking pictures. And then I… Chris. You left my backpack, didn’t you?

CHRIS	What? No. Sam, help me dig. We’re gonna miss the boat.

SAM	I don’t wanna get dirty.

LEX	Chris, you left it.

CHRIS	Shit. I guess I got distracted when the birds came and left it in the room but… can I just buy you a new one?

LEX	No. You guys, you want me to leave my stuff? That’s insane. Plus it has my phone and my wallet in it.

BREE	Lex, come on.

LEX	Bree, if it was your phone, you would already be inside.

CHRIS	Yeah, but if it was backed up, you’re good.

LEX	Well, it’s not.

SAM	How’s it not backed up?

LEX	Well, I don’t think it is but it doesn’t matter because I’m not leaving my stuff, okay? I need my phone. It has my pictures and all of my notes on it.

CHRIS	Lex. This isn’t a good idea.

SAM	Oh, my god.

LEX	But I will just meet you at the boat.

LEX	Okay?

BREE	Lex.

CHRIS	Lex.

SAM	Dude, this is the exact part of the scary movie that pisses me off.

BREE	Seriously this is so stupid.

SAM	Yeah.

CHRIS	306 right there.
SAM	Oh, can we move a little faster?

LEX	I don’t have a flashlight, Sam.

SAM	Mine’s big enough for all of us.

LEX	Where’s my bag, Chris?

CHRIS	It-I left it right here.

SAM	You sure this is the room?

BREE	Yes, this is 306.

SAM	Then where’s-where’s the bag?

BREE	You’re being

BREE	so unhelpful.

SAM	Oh, my god. Where are you going?

LEX	Is there anything over there? No?

SAM	Oh, it’s empty.

LEX	I mean are you sure? Did you look all around the corner?

BREE	It’s not over here.

SAM	It’s an empty room, Lex.

LEX	I know that. It was before.

SAM	It’s pouring. We have to go. We’re gonna miss this boat.

LEX	Okay, then let’s check the other rooms.

CHRIS	Guys.

BREE	(makes noise)

SAM	I know where he is.

CHRIS	Get in here.

SAM	Where’d that come from?

BREE	Room… no, no.

CHRIS	I’m in here.

LEX	Chris? Chris?

BREE	I don’t think…

LEX	God.

SAM	Oh. Oh, shit.

BREE	Oh, my god.

CHRIS	Found your bag.

CHRIS	It was like that when I came in here.

CHRIS	Lex, your bag was sitting in the corner.

LEX	We didn’t even come in this room though.

BREE	Yeah, but how did your bag get in here?

SAM	What I wanna know is how did a coyote get in here?

BREE	I didn’t even know they had coyotes in Hawaii.

SAM	They don’t.

LEX	It kind of looks like it was 

LEX 	escaping.

SAM	What?

CHRIS	Guys, let’s just get the fuck out of here.

BREE	Yeah.

LEX	I have to take a picture.

BREE	Lex, come on, for real?

LEX	I know, I know. I’ll be fast.

SAM	(sighs)

BREE	Guys, I’m leaving.

LEX	Okay, we’re going.

CHRIS	Sam.

CHRIS	I thought you quit smoking, man.

SAM	I did.

BREE	Don’t lie.

SAM	I’m not lying.

SAM	I haven’t smoked a cigarette in over six months.

LEX	Okay, but then whose is that?

SAM	I don’t know.

BREE	Someone’s here.

SAM	Wait. Hit the light. Hit the light. Hit the light.

BREE	Hello. Hello.

LEX	Hey.

SAM	What are you doing? We were trespassing.

BREE	They know we’re in here.

SAM	Yeah, we don’t know that.

CHRIS	Just turn off your light and let’s just figure another way out of here.

SAM	Come on, come on.

LEX	Um, Sam, Sam, was there an exit by the floor?

SAM	Oh, I don’t know. I mean I-I’ll figure how to get us back down there.

BREE	Why are we hiding? Why don’t we just ask them for a ride?

SAM	I mean those, whoever that is probably isn’t gonna be happy that we’re in here.

MALE	(screams)

LEX	(gasps)

SAM	Whoa.

BREE	(screams)

CHRIS	Shh, it’s okay. We need to-to have-exit now.

BREE	I am not doing this.

LEX	Okay. Let’s do the front…

MALE	(screams)

SAM	Fuck it.

CHRIS	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

SAM	What? You got a better idea?

CHRIS	I’ll do it.

CHRIS	It’s security.

SAM	Everybody in.

LEX	Wait, no, what? We-we can’t take steal their truck.

SAM	Yeah, we can.

LEX	What about them? What if they need help?

SAM	Go fucking help them now. I’m getting out of here.

CHRIS	Sam, let’s just leave the truck and run, man.

SAM	I’m not leaving, if we had a pickup truck… what are you doing?

SAM	Chris, give me the fucking keys.

CHRIS	My key-whose keys, man?

SAM	Give me the fucking 

SAM	keys, Chris.

BREE	Guys, no.

SAM	(grunts)

LEX	Stop.

CHRIS	Enough with the truck

BREE		Get in the car, guys.

LEX	Bree, get out

BREE	Chris, Chris, just hand the keys, let’s go.

CHRIS	Do you wanna go to jail?

SAM	Are you serious?

LEX	Guys?

LEX	Guys!

SAM	Bree.

CHRIS	Bree, get out.

LEX	What’s going on?

SAM	Bree, open the door, Bree.

CHRIS	Open up.

LEX	Bree, how’d you do that?

BREE	(makes noise)

SAM	Bree.

LEX	Why is it locked?

CHRIS	Get out.

SAM	Bree, what are you doing?

BREE	I didn’t do that.

MALE (ON RADIO)	Can you hear me?

BREE	Yes, yes, I can hear you. Guys…

MALE (ON RADIO)	Down here, can you please help me?

BREE	Who… wait, wait, where-where is here?

BREE	(breathes heavy) Guys.

BREE	Get me out of here, guys.

BREE	Wait.

CHRIS	Glass won’t break.

SAM	Watch out, watch out, watch out.

BREE	(screams) Oh, no.

BREE	(pants)

BREE	(screams)

SAM	Bree.

LEX	(screams)

LEX	(cries)

SAM	Bree.

LEX	Oh, my god. Oh, my god. (cries) Someone get down there. What if…she’s down and we have to help her.

CHRIS	(whispers)

LEX	No, I’m going-I’m going… 

CHRIS	Stay up here with Sam.

SAM	I don’t know. Let him go down there, okay? Just let him go down there. Just…

SAM	(sighs)

LES	She’s dead, isn’t she?

SAM	Nobody survives a crash like that.

CHRIS	(exhales)

SAM	I got you.

LEX	(cries)

DET. PETERSON	Okay, so you’re saying that this truck

DET. PETERSON	started on its own, shifted into gear and drove your friend off the ledge.

LEX	Look, I know what it sounds like but what’s what happened.

DET. PETERSON	Okay, excuse me if it sounds like I don’t believe you but I find it hard…

LEX	Hard to believe that a truck could have a life of its own and kill my friend.

DET. PETERSON	Pretty much, yeah. How do we know that she didn’t just knock it into gear herself in a panic? And then

LEX	Because I was there and I saw it with my own two eyes.

DET. PETERSON	I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. I got to cover all the angles. It’s just that I’m not used to chasing ghosts in a homicide investigation.

LEX	Yeah, well, I’m not used to seeing my friends die at the hands of one either.

DET. PETERSON	It must have been hard for you to see.

LEX	We hadn’t seen anything yet.

SAM	(shivers)

LEX	Why are you doing that?

SAM	What?

LEX	Shivering.

SAM	(makes noise)

CHRIS	The hell you guys looking at?

CHRIS	What was that?

SAM	Run.

LEX	(screams)

LEX	Guys, maybe over here. Yeah, no. No. Oh, my god, you got to be kidding me.

SAM	(screams)

CHRIS	Guys, move.

SAM	(screams) Why would the-why would the exit door be chained?

LEX	Come on.

CHRIS	There’s got to be another way out. Come on.

SAM	Go, go, go.

CHRIS	S-s-s-Sam, wait, wait. Where are we going, man?

SAM	I don’t… 

SAM	is fucking what. Let’s go.

CHRIS	Wait, wait, what the fuck was that thing then? (heavy breathing)

LEX	Wait, wait.

LEX	You guys saw its eyes, right? Did you see its eyes?

SAM	It fooled my eyes. Just need to get the fuck out of here. (heavy breathing)

LEX	See, I don’t know, but that’s what I mean. I mean they’re real, you guys. Those are real.

SAM	(gasps) I don’t know, I don’t know if we’re up there, our brains are playing tricks on us whatever, that was the realest fucking ghost that I have ever seen.

CHRIS	So what-what do we do about it? (heavy breathing) 

LEX	Got to get… are you sure you can’t get us back to that exit by the…?

SAM	I’ll fucking get us there. Let’s go.

SAM 	Come on, come on, come on. (heavy breathing)

CHRIS	Wait. Where are we?

SAM	This looks like a fucking war zone.

CHRIS	It’s the basement.

LEX	I think it’s like storage or maintenance or something.

SAM	Let’s go back up.

SAM	Move, move.

SAM	Guys, over here. Over here, come on.

CHRIS	This can’t be happening.

LEX	Oh, my god. You guys, that was her. That was the Half-Faced Girl.

SAM	Half-Face Girl? That’s just a fucking story.

LEX	Oh, I know what I saw. But we need to get out of here now. 

CHRIS	Our flashlights are dying.

SAM	All right, let’s, uh, just let’s go back the way we came.

CHRIS	The way we… why would we come back the way we came?

SAM	We can’t see shit. We don’t know what’s down here.

LEX	I am not going back to face whatever that was.

CHRIS	I know there has to be another way out of here, man.

LEX	Guys, look.

CHRIS	Okay.

CHRIS	Stay close so we don’t get separated. We good?

SAM	Yeah.

LEX	Yeah.

CHRIS	Okay. Let’s get the hell out of here.

SAM	There’s no fucking Half-Faced Girl.

LEX	Does anyone see anything? Okay.

CHRIS	Sam.

CHRIS	Dude.

CHRIS	Sam?

LEX	Sam?

CHRIS	Stop messing around, man.

LEX	Sam.

CHRIS	Sam, let’s get out of here. Come on.

CHRIS	Sam.

CHRIS	Look, we got to go.

LEX	Bree, are you okay?


BREE	Happy birthday, Alexandra. 

BREE	Happy birthday to you.

LEX	Bree, are you okay? Bree, stop. Bree, don’t.

LEX	(screams)

LEX	And then all I remember is waking up here, coming to the hospital doors and I can’t remember anything after that.

DET. PETERSON	It is a lot to take in. And you say this woman…

LEX	Girl, it was the Half-Faced Girl.

DET. PETERSON	The girl, right. She killed your friends. Are you sure they’re dead?

LEX	As sure as I see you here now, I watched them die.

DET. PETERSON	(sighs) I can’t even imagine what you’ve gone through. But I could promise you this. Everything’s gonna be okay now. I’m gonna call the station. We’re gonna do a search at the island. We won’t stop until we find out who’s responsible for this.

DET. PETERSON	I got some missing kids. Okay, yeah, canine, poor girl. That would be good, thank you. Okay.

GUY	Hey, uh, chief has a chopper ready.

DET. PETERSON	Okay.
