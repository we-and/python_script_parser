olaf	why? 

witch	when the time comes, you will know why. 

walt	 we’ve been walking forever! where is this "hairy godmother" you were talking about?

alex	wait 

alex	do you know why we were looking for the fairy godmother and not you?

crystal	why?

alex	because everyone knows how talented she is?but no one knows how skilled you are.

crystal	i know, my teacher is famous.

alex	but, i bet you can be as well-known as your teacher.

crystal	how? 

alex	by helping ella become the most beautiful girl at the ball.

crystal	hmm….then you really need me

crystal	first, you’re going to need a horse.

manny	so, uh, what am i now?   

walt	hahaha! you look like a donkey! 

manny	i hate donkeys. hee-haw 

walt	 at least you’re taller now. 

crystal	i’m sure it will work this time. 

walt	now we’re both stallion 

manny	much better looking than a donkey.

manny	why didn’t it work on you 

crystal	hmmm,it’s so strange. why are you still a mouse?

crystal	no worries, i can fix this. 

crystal	weird?

ella	two horses are enough.

crystal	sure! now it’s your turn! the star of the night !

walt	i want a royal dinner!  i ‘m going to the kitchen!

alex	i know where the kitchen is.

walt	all right guys, let’s go!

walt	it’s so much easier as a mouse!

crystal	you know, you actually look good as a horse.

walt	i don’t need compliments … i want food.

crystal	i can get you food. but you’ll owe me.

walt	ok! whatever you want!! i promise!

crystal	i can’t think of anything right now, but i will.

manny	ok ok?just hurry?

manny	ah! feels good to be a mouse again.

walt	so much better! ah!

alex	but there will be guards.

alex/many/walt	amazing. 

crystal	let’s go!

manny	haha. you’re even shorter than me. hilarious! 

crystal	you want to be a donkey again??

olaf	and she has a sense of humor!

ella	my friends think so too.

olaf	how do you like my palace?

olaf	can i show you my favorite place.

ella	where is that?

olaf	my beautiful garden.

ella	i’d prefer to see your kitchen

olaf	kitchen?! are you hungry?

ella	maybe my friends are

manny	i love this style, such nice décor

walt	what’s décor?

manny	it’s means good taste.

walt	it taste good?

manny	that's what i get for talking to peasants!

walt	phew! i almost lost my head there!

servant	your highness...

crystal	what are you looking at?

alex	weird. but it …all looks familiar.

walt	come on. i’m hungry. let's go to the kitchen. 

alex	alright, this way.

crystal	wait!

many	huh?

crystal	i sense dark magic…

alex	dark magic?

crystal	an evil magic, that only the meanest witches practice.

many	that’s impossible, we’re in the palace.

crystal	i can feel the dark magic, behind this wall

manny	ahh… the wall swallowed her!

crystal	guys, get in here, quickly

manny	don’t leave me here by myself guys.

manny	are you guys alright? 

walt	are we in the underworld?

walt	ah…!

manny	are you scared or something??

crystal	it's over there!

manny	ah…!!

manny	now what??

crystal	something’s wrong here.

alex	look! up there!

walt	what is this place?

manny	looks like a dungeon.

crystal	someone’s practicing dark magic here …. 

eagle	master! she’s here!

witch	are you sure??

eagle	yes, master.

witch	excellent! she’s right where we want her. we must capture her tonight…and stop her from reversing the curse.

eagle	master. you believe in that prophecy?

crystal	prophecy?

witch	we can’t risk it.

which	by getting rid of her, the prophecy is meaningless and that prince will stay a mouse forever.

alex	ahh!

witch	who’s there?

crystal	run!

walt	does this mean dinner is canceled tonight?

manny	are you kidding me? we are the dinner now! run!

which	there they are, catch them!

guard	yes?your majesty?

guard	catch who? 

which	those mice! 

guards	errr…right! the mice…

guards	this way! 

guards	ah!

guards	this way!

julianna	is that ella?

madeline	wait, are you sure?

stepmother	no, that can’t be her. she doesn’t even have a dress.

olaf	so, tell me about your family.

ella	i live with my stepmother and stepsisters. 

madeline	look, she smiled at us.

olaf	are they beautifull like you?

ella	of course

julianna	that is ella

stepmom	how did all of this happen?

guards	catch them, grab them! those  mice.

alex	we have to find ella!!

crystal	giddy up

walt	hey! do you still think i’m a horse?

crystal	just keep running! 

many	you sure?

walt	what are you saying,  the door is closed

crystal	remember that favor?trust me?

walt	i’m a horse, i’m a horse!
 
walt	i’m a....i am a horse!

crystal	ella?

ella	oh. whoa!

ella	what’s going on?

crystal	i’ll explain later!

guard	after them! faster !

guard	stop them, close the gate?

manny	the gate is closing! 

walt	what are we going to do! 

alex	let’s go that way!

manny	you sure about that?

guards	halt! don’t go in there!

guards	they’re heading towards the maze! we’ll catch them there!

alex	turn left!

alex	that way!

olaf	who were they?

witch	the ones i’ve been searching for.

olaf	the girl? ella?

witch	yes?and the mouse.

olaf	but, why don’t you just use your magic to stop them? 

which	if i use my dark magic, everybody will know what i am ,won`t they

which	follow them!

ella	what`s happening?

crystal	there’s a witch inside the palace chasing us!

ella	how can that possibly be?!

crystal	and that prince you dance with, is a fake!

ella	then where’s the real prince??

crystal	the real prince is a mouse.

ella	what?

walt	a mouse?

walt	i will host you in my palace...

manny	can’t you see i’m different than you ?

crystal	oh, no, not you two !

ella	so,  is it him?

alex	i remember something, but i don’t want to talk about it!

ella	c’mon, what happened to you? 

alex	when i was five

alex	my father hired a tutor for me. she was lovely. and everyone liked her. 

alex	she even taught me how to paint

alex	one year later, i lost my parents

alex	after that, my tutor changed

alex	she wanted to take over the kingdom. 

alex	and then, i found out she was an evil enchantress.

alex	she used her magic to turn me into a mouse

alex	and then, she erased all my memories.

ella	that’s horrible, how could she do that? what a despicable, nasty, witch!

walt	poor guy!

manny	i can’t believe i’ve been living with a prince.

ella	how sad.

crystal	who is she, her voice sounded a bit familiar. 

ella	you know magic, don't you? why can't you just undo the spell?

crystal	transforming a human requires powerful magic, dark magic.

ella	what in the world?

crystal	i’m not at that level yet. that must be why i couldn’t change him into a horse.

manny	then what do we do now?

crystal	hmmmm , i remember reading something about this.

crystal	there’s a ring, that can break this black spell!

crystal	in the heartland.

ella	well, then let's go there. 

crystal	but it's only a legend

ella	we have to try!

crystal	you'll have to go on your own. i'm not going.

ella	this is his only chance to turn back to human

crystal	it’s too dangerous.

ella	i can ask someone else.

crystal	why don’t you listen to me.

manny	she’s just afraid.

walt	afraid?

crystal	who said i was.

manny	if you’re not, prove it.

crystal	i`ll show you, fine. let’s go! right now!

ella	i knew you wouldn’t leave us.

crystal	i must have lost my mind

ella	okay,  we’re going!

alex	i don’t want to go.

ella	so, what’s your name?

alex	i don't think mice even have names.

ella	come on, everyone has a name.

alex	alex, my name was alex.

ella	i knew something was different about you. you’re polite, you use a fork and knife, oh, and you can dance too.

alex	but i’m still a mouse. 

ella	we will make you human again.

alex	i don’t think that’s possible.

ella	you will never know if you don’t try.

alex	i’m no match against her.

ella	alex, you are not alone. we’ll help you. 

alex	i don't want you guys to be in danger. 

ella	i understand, i lost my parents too.

ella	but together, we can defeat the witch.

alex	you'd better leave before they come and find me.

ella	we won’t leave you. 

alex	i don’t need you, please just leave. i like being a mouse.

ella	do you really want to live in the shadows forever?

ella	or,  do you want to dance with me as a human?

eagle	master, they’re heading to the heartland.

which	they must believe in that ridiculous legend! it’s just another stupid old wives tale.

eagle	but … what if they find the ring?

which	we can’t let that happen

which	take this!  follow them 

eagle	yes, master.

manny	crystal, are there any animals out here, specifically ones that like to eat mice?

walt	yeah, like cats? i don’t like cats.  

crystal	well there are fire dragons, iron lions and fierce monsters…. 

walt	eh..ah.. 

crystal	but no!...no cats. 

walt	phew…perfect ! no cats!

ella	i wonder what you’ll look like when you’re human 

alex	if i’m ugly, would you still be my friend?

ella	maybe?

alex	then i don’t want to go

ella	i’m kidding, c’mon

alex	you~

walt	wow. a berry!

turtle	don’t touch my fruit.

walt	huh? who said that?

manny	something weird always happens when you pick fruit.

crystal	where are you?

turtle	what are you doing here.

walt	oh..we’re…

crystal	just playing … (hehe)

turtle	playing? alright ,there are rules here.

ella	i can’t believe there are rules in the forest

turtle	rule , don’t touch any plants including flowers, trees or herbs 

turtle	rule , no climbing on trees and rocks.

crystal	eh….

turtle	rule , no littering ….

manny	does that count as littering?

turtle	not littering per se, but it does violate number, don’t pollute the environment.

turtle	where were we? let’s start over again. rule , don’t touch any plants

crystal	including flowers, trees or herbs!

crystal	we got it, thanks!

ella	thank you

turtle	where are you going?

crystal	who does that turtle think he is?

manny	yeah!  the boss of this place?

walt	maybe he is 

walt	huh?

walt	eh…eh…ahhhhhh…eh…  

many/walt	ahhh

crystal	we have to get out of here!

alex	what is this?  


crystal	whatever it is, just keep going!

manny	no no……go away

manny	eh ah, why is  this happening to me!?

walt	(ahhhh)

walt	(umph.)

alex	it got me 

ella	alex

ella	let him go! 

crystal	that will teach you!

ella	keep running! 

ella	we need to jump!

crystal	are you kidding me?!

ella & crystal	(woaahhhh!)  

manny	i surrender! 

alex/walt/manny	?ahhhh!)

alex	you hear that? 

walt	what?

manny	water!!

crystal	help, i can’t swim!

ella	is everyone okay?

manny	no, not really! 

walt	was that a dragon? 

crystal	no, it must be her.

alex	this is too dangerous, we should go back. 

manny	great idea! let’s go!

crystal	he’s right.

ella	we’ve come this far, we can’t give up now. 

walt	we have no idea where the ring is.

manny	i don’t know if we can survive the next danger! 

crystal	you really need to see this.

alex	amazing!

ella	you see? the ring!

crystal	it’s not just a legend!  

manny	what genius put the ring up there? 

walt	can anybody fly?

alex	be careful, ella!

ella	i will.

walt	she’s really flying!

ella	huh?  

manny	what’s going on?

ella	i can’t get it 

crystal	what does it feel like?

ella	nothing!

walt	but we can see it!

ella	c’mon! c’mon! what’s wrong with it?

manny	this is giving me a headache.

ella	crystal, why can’t i get the ring?

crystal	i don’t know!. 

crystal	i only know what’s in the book, i guess the legend was wrong.

walt	after all that?

manny	are you telling us it’s not real?

ella	sorry

alex	you all tried your best 

alex	maybe this is my fate 

ella	alex, don’t lose hope 

alex	it’s alright 

ella	i will search forever until you become human again.

turtle	that was really moving.

many	i know it! you set us up! what do you want from us?

turtle	i’ve been here, for hundreds of years. i’ve seen so many people come for the ring, filled with their own desires.

turtle	they all leave with nothing. they come for themselves 

turtle	but you,are the only one who is here for others.

ella	do you know where the ring is?

turtle	it’s right here

ella	but i can’t get it

turtle	if it was easy,then anyone can get it 

crystal	i’m so foolish! he’s the guardian of the ring! 

walt	what’s a guardian? 

manny	that means he really is the boss of this place. 

turtle	my mission is now complete. good luck  

ella	alex! here! 

ella	alex!

manny	let’s chase them 

ella	crystal, guard the entrance.

crystal	you can’t escape from here

eagle	keep dreaming mouse boy. 

walt	oh no … what do we do? 

manny	let’s get to the high ground !
