RADIO ANNOUNCER	Nathan Redding is in hot water.  The singer recently got in an accident, crashing into his ex-girl friend's car, and rumors are that his marriage is down in the rocks as well. More on that when we come back and we'll also be giving away tickets to Nathan's concert next month. 

JAMES	Mary, hey, do me a favor. Did you hear about Nathan Redding? Yeah, the singer. Can you call his manager and see if you can schedule me a meeting? Whenever, I'll make myself available. 

JAMES	Uh, just grabbing some breakfast. Gotta swing by my house but I'll be right in. Alright. Thanks.

ANCHOR	Fresh off a multi-platinum selling record, Nathan Redding is falling from favor after he ran into his ex-girl friend's car this week.  Eye witness accounts are mixed but some say the wreck looked deliberate. 

NATHAN	I didn't ram into her.

JAMES	Well, why don't you tell me what really happened.

NATHAN	It was an accident. I was driving, I was on the phone, I didn't stop in time.  No one was hurt, but the car I hit it belonged to my ex-girlfriend. 

JAMES	She was driving. 

NATHAN	Yeah. Police came, reports filed, insurance claimed.  It's all settled there, but my publicist, who I fired now, said that me and my ex were on great terms and see each other often. 

JAMES	And you're married. 

NATHAN	Yeah, that's why I called you Mr. Reed.

JAMES	James, please.  I can help you.  Our firm is the best for a reason, but I need to know how serious you are about fixing this. 

NATHAN	How serious I am? 

JAMES	Are you leaving anything out that can come back to haunt us both? 

NATHAN	Kara, my ex, we didn't part on the best of terms. 

JAMES	So she won't be helping the situation.

NATHAN	My concert tour isn't selling well, people are believing what they're reading. But the worst part is it's hurting my marriage. My wife doesn't like being dragged through the mud and she doesn't like me being dragged through the mud either. 

JAMES	Take some time off, spend it with your wife. 

NATHAN	But the tour dates are public, tickets have been sold. Cancelling sends the wrong message. 

JAMES	I didn't say cancel. Reschedule five or so concerts, take some quality time away from the spotlight.


NATHAN	Yeah, that's kind of a big deal. 

JAMES	We'll release an appropriate statement about the change, make no mention of the ex and move on.

NATHAN	Why no mention? 

JAMES	You don't bring the garbage back in the house.

NATHAN	Okay. 

JAMES	Okay? 

NATHAN	You're surprised?

JAMES	Yeah, I'm used to stubborn resistance. 

NATHAN	You know, when it comes to the ones you love, you make certain sacrifices, no matter the cost. When do we make the announcement?

JAMES	Hello, Mary. 

MARY	Good morning, James. 

DAWSON	James. You got Nathan Redding on board? 

JAMES	Yes sir. 

DAWSON	Keep it up. 

JAMES	Will do.

KATE	That will get you a hefty bonus. Want to blow it all by taking me out? 

JAMES	Maybe later. 

KATE	Tight wad.

JAMES	Oh, come on.

KATE	What?

JAMES	My lunch is missing, again.

JAMES	It could be any one of them. 

KATE	You have to let this go. 

JAMES	Randall, maybe?

KATE	Why don't we go out for lunch? 

JAMES	Or Mary. 

KATE	There's this place I love, it's around the corner, and it's like. . . 

JAMES	Look at Carol. 

JAMES	This is ridiculous. I had something good today too.

KATE	What, like Chinese take out? 

JAMES	That never gets stolen. Steak cutlets.
	
KATE	Wow, they are paying you too much. 

JAMES	I've earned every penny. 

KATE	And I haven't?

JAMES	You are amazing. 

KATE	That's more like it. Come on, let's go. 

JAMES	I can't, I've got a meeting in ten minutes. 

KATE	Alright, well, I have an Asian salad left over from yesterday.

JAMES	Oh. No thanks.

JAMES	Hey, yeah I'm almost ready.  We have reservations, we're gonna be fine. Are you ready? Alright, alright.  See you soon. 

JAMES	Oh, come on.

KATE	So he gets into this fight in public.

JAMES	I saw the photos. 

KATE	Yeah, and he's thinking we should make it look like it's the other guy's fault. 

JAMES	You are the spin doctor.

KATE	True, but come on, you'd think he'd be a man and own up to up.

JAMES	Is that what you're gonna have him do? 

KATE	No, I'll spin it. I have a really good plan, actually.
JAMES	Killer instincts. 

KATE	If only you had a little more. 

JAMES	It's good that I don't. That's what makes us a good pair. 

KATE	Do you ever think about the future. 

JAMES	You mean space ships and hovercrafts, or us? 

KATE	More about career.

JAMES	Um, yeah. 

KATE	And?

JAMES	Well, I'm due for a promotion soon. 

KATE	Is that what you want? 

JAMES	I don't know. For now, yeah. Sure. 

KATE	Don't you love this? 

JAMES	Cleaning up people's messes?

KATE	It's thrilling. 

JAMES	Not exactly. 

KATE	You meet a lot of people, and powerful people. 

JAMES	It doesn't really do it for me. 

KATE	You know why I like it?

JAMES	Why? 

KATE	I like seeing them squirm.

JAMES	Squirm? 

KATE	With all their money and fame they need me to exert some influence.

JAMES	You are amazing. 

KATE	And don't you forget it.

JAMES	You're gonna take my sandwich? I'll teach you. Let's see if you enjoy this one. A little Tabasco sauce. Help that go down a little bit better. A little more. Wasabi. Perfect. 

JAMES	I'll teach you to take my sandwich. Oh, yeah, you're gonna like that.

JAMES	A little pepper. Yeah, why not? Cayenne. You're gonna like that. Alright.

JAMES	Hello? I know, I know, it's not fair. It's the law of public relations. In a perfect world you get community service, but when everybody knows about it there's other consequences.

JAMES	Look, I'm working on the release right now. I'll send it over to your team before I contact anyone else. Okay.

KATE	Did it happen again?

JAMES	Yep. 

KATE	Anything?

JAMES	Not yet. 

KATE	This isn't low fat.

JAMES	Where's Carol?

KATE	You're kidding. 

KATE	What did you put on it? 

JAMES	A little of everything.

MARY	James. 

JAMES	Hang on.

MARY	Your mom called. 

JAMES	She called you? 

MARY	She left a message, she said she's been trying to get a hold of you. Some family emergency at home. I guess she just started trying random extensions.

JAMES	Thanks. 

MARY	You're welcome.

BARBARA	Jimmy, something's happened to your dad. We've been calling everywhere to reach you but you haven't answered. Call as soon as you can.

JAMES	Hey, you got a minute? 

DAWSON	Sure.

JAMES	You alright?

DAWSON	Something I ate. 

JAMES	Hey, uh, I need to take a few days off.

DAWSON	Anything wrong?

JAMES	No, it's my Dad. He's sick.

DAWSON	I hope it's not serious. When will you leave?

JAMES	Still checking flights. Probably, uh, tomorrow. 

DAWSON	And your work?

JAMES	Well, Kate and Mary are going to help out, and I'll be on call as needed. I'll be gone a week tops. 

DAWSON	Okay, take the time you need.

JAMES	I'll be back in a week.

KATE	Thai food? 

JAMES	How about pizza, I never now what to get at that Thai place. 

KATE	I'll order for you. Hi, I'd like. . . . Fine, I'll hold.  Is this it?

JAMES	Yeah. 

KATE	Reed Mill Bed & Breakfast. 

JAMES	Yeah, real exciting.

KATE	It's quaint.

JAMES	Sure, if you're staying there for fun. 

KATE	Oh, you don't have fun? 

JAMES	Hauling guest bags around cleaning up after the rowdy ones, repairing toilets. No. 

KATE	You don't have to go.

JAMES	It's my dad. 

KATE	Where is this again? 

JAMES	Idaho.

KATE	Oh yes, I'd like to order one basil egg plant, one Tom Yung Gong, one red curry dish, extra hot please, and your spinach tofu stir-fry.

LINDSAY	Jimmy!

JAMES	Hey, Lindsay.  How are you?

LINDSAY	Better now that you're back. 

JAMES	How's dad? 

LINDSAY	Mom's bringing him home. 

JAMES	Already?

LINDSAY	She said the doctors kicked him out the door since the stroke was only mild. 

JAMES	Sounds like mom.

LINDSAY	I know.  

LINDSAY	There're back!

JAMES	Hey mom. 

BARBARA	You should have called. We could have picked you up at the airport. 

JAMES	I didn't want to inconvenience anyone. 

BARBARA	Lindsay, there's a walker in the back. 

LINDSAY	A walker?

BARBARA	Grab it. 

LINDSAY	Yeah. 

JAMES	Hey dad. 

HENRY 	Hello, son.

JAMES	Can I help you get out of here? 

HENRY 	Yeah.

HENRY 	Uh, okay. 

JAMES	You alright?

HENRY 	Oh, it's good to be home.

BARBARA	Okay, Lindsay, back to the chores now.

HENRY	I love you sweetie. 

LINDSAY	I love you too. 

BARBARA	I'll get you something to eat. I don't want taking all those pills on an empty stomach. 

HENRY 	Thanks, Barb.

HENRY 	How was your flight? 

JAMES	Fine. You look better than I expected. 

HENRY	Your mom made sound like I was at death's door.

JAMES	You can't take a stroke lightly. 

HENRY 	I'll be fine. Just gotta get back on my feet. Can you give me a hand with this please?

JAMES	Uh. So, how serious was it, really?

HENRY	I was just doing some chores. I fell down some how and then I uh, had trouble getting back up.

JAMES	Mom said you blacked out, an ambulance came. 

HENRY 	Well, how would I know then?

HENRY 	How long are you back? 

JAMES	Just a week. I've got a lot going on at work, so I need to. . . 

HENRY 	No, it's great. I'm glad you could come.

JAMES	Everything okay here? 

HENRY 	Yeah, good enough. Where is that remote?

JAMES	Shouldn't you rest? 

HENRY 	A man can only sleep so much.

TOM	Drive here from California? No wonder it took you so long.

JAMES	It's a rental and I flew. I got here as soon as I could.

TOM	Staying long? 

JAMES	No. 

TOM	It figures. There's a leak in Room 5. Make yourself useful. 

JAMES	Good to see you too, Tom.

BARBARA	Dinner's almost ready Jimmy. 

JAMES	Uh, thanks, I ate on the plane. 

BARBARA	Then come get dessert in a little bit. We need to talk.

LINDSAY	Do they even feed you on the plane anymore? 

JAMES	Go eat.

LINDSAY	Paige called. She said she had something come up and had to leave early. 

TOM	Oh? Is she alright?

LINDSAY	I don't know. I'm just passing on the message. 

JAMES	Oh, does Paige still work here?

LINDSAY	Uhh huh.

JAMES	You said come talk. 

BARBARA	We have to figure out what to do. 

JAMES	About?

TOM	What do you think? 

BARBARA	The bed and breakfast. 

JAMES	Great. 

BARBARA	Recovering from a stroke could take months.

JAMES	Dad seems fine to me. 

TOM	Seriously, you see only what you want to. You'll get back to your life soon. Don't worry. 

BARBARA	Tom, hush. The truth is, he's lost control of his right leg and his arms aren't as strong either. Frankly, he needs to take it easy.

JAMES	So how's the bed and breakfast doing? 

TOM	Short handed. 

JAMES	Well let's hire someone. 

TOM	Can't afford to. 

BARBARA	We have one extra person besides the family and with your dad down for the count we can't handle the load ourselves. We could use your help.

JAMES	I have a job. 

TOM	Here we go. 

BARBARA	I know, and I wouldn't ask if we could make it ourselves.

JAMES	I can't. I'm in the middle of handling a crisis right now, and I'm up for a job promotion. I can't just. . . 

BARBARA	It's only until Dad's better.

TOM	We can make it work without him mom. 

LINDSAY	Not really. 

JAMES	Weren't you trying to guilt me into staying? 

BARBARA	No one's guilting anyone. Your Dad just has a lot of physical therapy and I'll be making trips to the hospital with him. 

JAMES	So we're down two people.

BARBARA	One and a half, and I'll still do what I can when I'm here. 

JAMES	Well, I'll help while I can, but I have to go back.

TOM	Surprise, surprise. 

JAMES	Aren't you glad?

JAMES	I'll think of something before I go.

JAMES	Kate, hey, can you hear me?  Kate, hey?

JAMES	Oh, I miss California.

LINDSAY	Jimmy?

TOM	Tell him to stop sleeping in.

JAMES	Is Dad still asleep? 

LINDSAY	Yeah. Mom wants us in the main kitchen.

JAMES	Okay, I'll be right there. 

LINDSAY	Okay.

JAMES	How many guest do you have today? 

BARBARA	Thirteen.

JAMES	What do you want me to do? 

TOM	I call the grounds. 

BARBARA	That leaves maintenance for you. Room 5 has a leak in the bathroom. They check out today so you can fix that later. Help cover the front desk and take care of guest's bags. 

JAMES	What about Dad?

BARBARA	He's got physical therapy today. Tom, will you look in on him while we're inside. 

TOM	Yeah, Mom. 

BARBARA	We don't have any guest activities booked for today but if something comes up I'll let you two know. Lindsay, run take this up to Dad. Be quiet in case he's still sleeping. 

LINDSAY	Okay. 

BARBARA	Jimmy keep stirring.  Good morning, front desk.

JAMES	You drink straight out of that I'll shove the whole thing down your throat.

TOM	I know the do's and don'ts. 

JAMES	Doesn't mean you follow them. 

BARBARA	Early check out. Jimmy, Room 2 needs help with bags. 

JAMES	Bell boy on his way.

HEFTY PACKER GUEST	I know, he completely ruined my flower beds. I had to call my landscaper to come back and fix it. But the same thing happened to Tina across the street. Well, I spoke to his boss, but he didn't do anything about it. Yeah. 

HEFTY PACKER GUEST	Thank you, my husband's pulling the car around. 

HEFTY PACKER GUEST	What? I know, and David was so upset.

JAMES	Tom, will you give me a hand? 

TOM	I can't get the luggage dirty. 

JAMES	You could take off the gloves.

BARBARA	Jimmy, Lindsay's leaving for school. Come help over here? 

LINDSAY	Have fun. 

JAMES	See you. What's that? 

BARBARA	Treats for throughout the day. I'll bake the first batch and Paige will take care of the rest later. You might want to leave that on a touch longer, Jimmy. 

JAMES	James. 

BARBARA	What?

JAMES	I go by James now. 

BARBARA	Since when? 

JAMES	Since I left.

JAMES	Hello?

JAMES	Oh, come on.

PAIGE	Hi there.  I'm so sorry, are you okay? 

JAMES	Yeah, yeah.

PAIGE	Oh, I scared you, huh? 

JAMES	A little bit. I'm James. 

PAIGE	Oh it's me, Paige.

JAMES	Oh, hey. Sorry, head trauma. 

PAIGE	That's okay. 

JAMES	Yeah, yeah. Wow, you've changed. You look good. Not that you didn't before. 

PAIGE	Thanks, it's good to see you too. 

PAIGE	So it's been a few years, huh? 

JAMES	Yeah, wow, I didn't think you'd still be here. 

PAIGE	Oh, why not? 

JAMES	I don't know - moved on to bigger and better things.

PAIGE	No, I wanted to stay. 

JAMES	So how you been?

PAIGE	Keeping busy, you know.  Oh, uh, your mom, she's leaving and wants you to cover the front 
desk.

JAMES	Okay. 

PAIGE	And I can clean up in here when you're done.

JAMES	Alright, thanks.

JAMES	Hello? Reed Mill Bed & Breakfast, how may I help you?

SANCHEZ	Hi, I need to cancel my reservation. 

JAMES	I'm sorry to hear that, and your name? 

SANCHEZ	Sanchez, for the 23rd.

JAMES	Okay, it looks like you have eight rooms, is this a change to one room or. . . 

SANCHEZ	No, all of them.

JAMES	Okay, thanks for letting us know.

JAMES	Hey. 

MR. GRANT	Hi, last name Grant, checking in.

MRS. GRANT	Great. I don't have service here. 

MR. GRANT	You wanted a get away, you got it. What's with the mill?

JAMES	It's an old flour mill, converted to a bed and breakfast about thirty years ago. 

MR. GRANT	Interesting.

JAMES	Yeah, there's still flour that falls from the attic. We can't seem to get rid of it. 

PAIGE	What's there to do around here? 

JAMES	Well, town's just down the road and here at Reed Mill we have fishing, canoeing on the pond, horse back riding, and we have a game room downstairs with a movie library to choose from.  Breakfast is at 9. 

MR. GRANT	How about fishing tomorrow?

MRS. GRANT	Fishing? 

JAMES	Sure.  Great, what time would you like? 

MR. GRANT	Ten. Uh, we've got baggage outside. 

JAMES	Great, I'll bring it right up.  You're in room 9. It's got a great view.

CHRISTINA RILEY	Good afternoon. 

JAMES	Hi, can I help you?

CHRISTINA RILEY	Yes, I heard about Mr. Reed. Is he alright? 

JAMES	Better, thank you. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	Oh, that's so good to hear. I'm friends with Barbara and Henry, I was so worried. 

JAMES	Alright, oh, thank you.

CHRISTINA RILEY	I wrote them a little note. 
JAMES	I'll make sure they get it. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	I thought I knew everyone here.

JAMES	I'm sorry, James, the older son.

CHRISTINA RILEY	Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. 

JAMES	Likewise. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	See you soon. 

JAMES	Alright.

TOM	Want a cookie? 

PAIGE	Those are for the guests.

TOM	Don't tell Mom, or Jimmy for that matter. 

PAIGE	Is he staying?

TOM	Long term, no. 

PAIGE	Huh, that's too bad.

TOM	You need any help out here.

PAIGE	Reed Mill Bed & Breakfast how can I help you? James, oh sure, one moment. 

TOM	Jimmy, phone. He's only been here two days and already people calling him. 

JAMES	Thanks.

JAMES	Hello? Hey, Kate, how are you?

KATE	Um, did you fall off the planet? 

JAMES	Practically, my cell phone barely works out here. 

KATE	How's home?

JAMES	Same. How's work. 

KATE	The same. Mary's lunch went missing today. 

JAMES	Wow.

KATE	Yeah, don't you miss it? 

JAMES	Yeah, not that part, but yeah. 

KATE	Nathan Redding called, he said so far so good on the tour changes. 

JAMES	Oh great, great. I'll follow up with him later. 

KATE	Miss me yet?

JAMES	You have no idea. 

KATE	Good. I bought some tickets to a Lakers game. 

JAMES	Really?

KATE	Yeah, thought I'd keep you motivated to come home. 

JAMES	Trust me, I'm motivated. 

KATE	Good, call me later, okay? 

JAMES	I will.

JAMES	Thanks.

TOM	What do you think, girlfriend? 
PAIGE	None of our business.

BARBARA	So, James, are you dating anyone?

JAMES	Yeah, her name's Kate. 

BARBARA	What does she do? 

JAMES	She's another publicist at work.

BARBARA	Are you two serious? 

JAMES	Sort of. 

TOM	That's a no.

JAMES	And how are you doing with the ladies, Tom?

BARBARA	Stop it you two. 

TOM	So did you find a way to fix all our problems yet Superman? 

BARBARA	So, I'm taking your father to the doctor tomorrow. 

JAMES	How'd he do today? 

BARBARA	Okay. He's in good spirits.

TOM	So what'd the doc say brought on the stroke?  Isn't he a little young to have one? 

BARBARA	He pushes it sometimes. There are other factors: genetics, stress. 

TOM	Stress? Working too hard, too much.

BARBARA	There's a lot to do, Tom.

TOM	Oh, I know. 

LINDSAY	Tom.

JAMES	If you've got something to say just come out and say it.

TOM	You dumped the work on Dad and you left. 

BARBARA	Stop it, Tom. 

JAMES	So it's my fault, is that it? 

TOM	Yep. 

JAMES	Nevermind the years I spent growing up here busting my tail off.  Or nevermind the fact that I should be able to create my own life, is that right? 

TOM	You always put yourself first.

JAMES	No, I don't, and you of all people should appreciate that. 

BARBARA	Would you two cut it out?

JAMES	Thanks for dinner, Mom.

TOM	Ow.

HENRY 	Found some dessert.

JAMES	Hey, should you be up?

HENRY 	I've got to get this body working again somehow, and it's not gonna happen napping all day.  There in the pouch. 

JAMES	Is this okay for you?

HENRY 	I had a stroke, Jimmy. I'm still suppose to eat.

HENRY 	So what's all the shouting about? 

JAMES	Nothing.

JAMES	I'm tired of being the prodigal son all the time. You know, I left. Big deal. There's nothing wrong or vengeful about it. 

HENRY 	Oh, I know.

JAMES	I've worked hard, I've got things to show for it. I got a great job, a nice apartment, girlfriend. I don't want to give it up.

HENRY 	Nobody's asking you to. 

JAMES	You sure, because I'm pretty happy out there.

HENRY 	But not here? 

JAMES	Can you blame me?

HENRY 	Nope. You drive your brother crazy, Jimmy.

JAMES	What? 

HENRY 	You know it's not your fault. You're successful. You can do anything and when you do it you do it all the way and I wouldn't change you, but maybe he sees it as twisting the knife a bit. He has wounds and he holds onto them. Just give him a chance to let it go. 

JAMES	It's easier to let him wallow in self pity. 

HENRY 	For you maybe. We got to live with the guy. 

HENRY 	You know, I used to look at people in wheelchairs and wonder how they could not go stir crazy not being able to walk under their own power.  One little stroke and I'm not too far from that.  It changes your perspective. Hopefully, you'll never have to walk in someone else's shoes quite so literally. 

BARBARA	Henry, there you are. What are you doing out of bed? 

HENRY 	What am I doing out of bed? 

JAMES	What are you doing out of bed?

BARBARA	Fine.  Oh these were addressed to us.

JAMES	Oh, yes, some woman dropped them by, Christina something. She said she knew you. 

HENRY 	Yeah, she does. She's a competitor. Don't worry about her.

BARBARA	Let's go. 

HENRY 	Yeah.

TOM	Really? 

JAMES	Sorry.  Check the fridge. 

TOM	Typical.

JAMES	You sure there's not any more. 

TOM	Does it look like there's any more?

JAMES	Mom's got more in the main kitchen.

LINDSAY	Sorry. 

JAMES	Don't worry about it. You finish eating already?

LINDSAY	Yeah. 

JAMES	You always were a speed eater. 

LINDSAY	I have two older brothers. Eat quickly

JAMES	. . . Or not at all.

LINDSAY	Still hungry I guess. So you're not going to leave because of Tom, are you?  I mean I understand why you left before, but don't go just because he's being a jerk. 

JAMES	It's not just 'cause of Tom. I have to leave anyway. 

LINDSAY	That's alright, I guess.  Just remember he doesn't speak for the rest of us. 

JAMES	Thanks.

BARBARA	Well, we hope to see you another time, then. Okay. Bye, bye. 

JAMES	What was that?

HENRY	Cancellation. 
	
JAMES	Yeah, I had one of those yesterday too. 

BARBARA	It happens. I see you booked guests for a fishing session.

JAMES	Yeah. 

BARBARA	Good. 

JAMES	So, what's the deal with Christina Riley?

BARBARA	She keeps offering to buy the place. 

JAMES	Are you considering it? 

BARBARA	Not really, and at her prices definitely not. But since the stroke she smells blood in the water. 

JAMES	Well, maybe it's not such a bad idea.

BARBARA	This is all we have, Jimmy.  We'd barely break even on the loans with what she's offering, and then what?

JAMES	Good morning Mrs. Grant.

MRS. GRANT	Let's get this thing over with. 

JAMES	Should we wait for Mr. Grant? 

MRS. GRANT	Mr. Grant has business in town. Some get away. 

JAMES	Oh boy.

JAMES	Okay, Mrs. Grant. Come stand by me. 

MRS. GRANT	I have no interest in fishing.

JAMES	Come on, it's fun.

MRS. GRANT	This was suppose to be a romantic get away.  That is until my husband decided to squeeze in a few meetings while we're here.  So this whole fishing stuff is just a lame attempt to try to keep me happy with quality time even though he's not here.

JAMES	Well, it doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself. 

MRS. GRANT	Yeah, I'm not fishing. You do it, I'll take it back with me like it's mine. 

JAMES	Well, actually, this is a catch and release only area. 

MRS. GRANT	Fine then. You catch the fish, we'll take a picture of me with it and call it good. 

JAMES	Okay.

PAIGE	I know I'm late, I'm so sorry. 

BARBARA	Perfect timing. Henry has physical therapy. 

JAMES	Everything okay?

PAIGE	Yeah, my car wouldn't start. 

JAMES	Well, can I help? 

PAIGE	Can you cover the front desk, I have to clean the rooms. 

JAMES	Yeah.

BARBARA	Can you help me with your father first? 

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Need a hand? 

HENRY 	New fingers maybe.

JAMES	Well, Mom's getting the car ready. 

HENRY 	I got it.

JAMES	Looking good Dad. 

HENRY 	Uhh, who cares? It's just therapy. How's your day going? 

JAMES	Good. I caught a fish for a guest who's most likely maxing out her husband's credit card right now to get back at him. 

JAMES	Hey. 

PAIGE	Hey. 

JAMES	Need a hand? 

PAIGE	No, I'm good, thanks, but could you, uh, give me a ride home?

JAMES	Yeah, sure. 

PAIGE	Thank you so much. 

JAMES	Yeah.

CHRISTINA RILEY	Hello? 

JAMES	What do you want now, Ms. Riley? 

CHRISTINA RILEY	Oh, it's Christina. Please, call me Christina. I'm just following up on my offer. Have your parents thought it over?

JAMES	They're a little pre-occupied with my father's health right now. 

BARBARA	Yes, I understand. That's why this offer's so important. 

JAMES	Well important to you maybe. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	I'm just trying to help them. Come here, look it, look, at my view. My vision of this property. Here's the Mill now. And this is my vision. See, all the land in the back of the property we make into more guest rooms. And in the middle we put this beautiful courtyard and pool.  It's still rustic, but it's what guests are looking for.  Just think how beautiful this could be.

JAMES	It's fine as it is.  And your offering much less than the property's worth is  not going to convince my parents otherwise.

CHRISTINA RILEY	It's a decent offer.  You know, I could just wait till all your customers go elsewhere and buy it at a bargain from the bank. 

JAMES	The Mill's customers are loyal. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	Yeah, sure they are.

JAMES	Tom! Tom, I figured it out. 

TOM	What? 

JAMES	The people that were cancelling on us.

TOM	What? 

JAMES	They're cancelling for a reason. 

TOM	I'm working here.

JAMES	Christina Riley is luring them away. 

TOM	Whatever. 

JAMES	I'm serious, man, she's playing hard ball.

TOM	I get it, okay, you want to be the hero again. Here comes Jimmy to save the day. 

JAMES	Tom! Fine, don't listen. 

TOM	How can I?

JAMES	Hey.

LINDSAY	Hey, want to help? 

JAMES	Sure.

JAMES	You know, you don't have to feed them, they can make it on their own.

LINDSAY	I know, I just like to do it.

LINDSAY	So, do you ever hear from Anna? 

JAMES	No, I don't.

LINDSAY	Do you miss her? 

JAMES	No. I guess. Not anymore. Does Tom?

LINDSAY	Sometimes, but he acts like it doesn't bother him. He just gets angry. 

JAMES	Yeah.

TOM	Hey, do you need a ride home? 

PAIGE	Oh, no thanks. James is gonna take me.

JAMES	So, why did you stick around here?

PAIGE	It's home. 

JAMES	Yeah, but didn't you want more?

PAIGE	Yes, and I still do. It gives me something to work towards. I hear you've got it made in California. 

JAMES	I've done alright for myself.

PAIGE	Making people seem better than they are? 

JAMES	Well, sometimes helping good people out of bad situations. 

PAIGE	Yeah, that's a better way to think of it. Oh, turn here.

JAMES	You still live here.

PAIGE	Yeah, like I said, it's home.

JAMES	Do you want me to take a look at your car? 

PAIGE	No, that's okay, thanks. My Mom said that she would take care of it, so hopefully it's, you know, working.

JAMES	What, did you get in a fender bender? 

PAIGE	Thanks for the ride, I'll see you tomorrow.

JAMES	Yeah, sure.  Hey, are you okay?

PAIGE	Mom, are you okay? What happened to the car? 

DORA	Tree in the wrong spot.

PAIGE	Were you hurt? 

DORA	I'm fine. 

PAIGE	Was anyone hurt? 

DORA	Just me and the tree. 

PAIGE	Mom, why didn't you call me? When did this happen?

DORA	On the way home from the repair shop. The engine works now.

JAMES	Christina Riley's pushing everyone to go to her resort. 

BARBARA	There's nothing wrong with that. 

JAMES	Well, she's going after our usual customers.

BARBARA	What are we suppose to do about that, Jimmy? 

JAMES	I don't know, but if she keeps it up, how much longer can we last? I mean forget the work load, we're not gonna have any guests. 

BARBARA	Lower your voice. Good morning. Have a seat. Hot waffles coming up in a minute.

MR. GRANT	Thank you. 

BARBARA	Help yourself to juice, tea, milk, whatever you'd like. The Bilson Company normally comes out every year for their retreat. 

JAMES	Normally? 

BARBARA	Yeah, I got a message from them. They've cancelled.

JAMES	It's her again. 

BARBARA	We'll be alright. 

JAMES	How? 

BARBARA	I don't know but we can't think about it right now. I need you to run to town to do the shopping. There's a list by the fridge.  Here we go. Checking out today? 

MRS. GRANT	Yes.

BARBARA	Well, I hope yo've enjoyed your stay. 

MRS. GRANT	Thank you.

KATE	Hello? 

JAMES	Hey.

KATE	James, checking up on me? 

JAMES	Well, I want to make sure you're still working hard.

KATE	Yeah, I'm working so hard I'm stealing all your clients. In fact, they're so impressed with me that they'll never go back to you. 

JAMES	Well, I guess you'll have to start spending all your money on me then. 

KATE	How's population 600?

JAMES	Well, more like 10,000 but that's including the horses. 

KATE	You must be going so stir crazy.

JAMES	Nah, there's too much to do. Just wanted to call and say hi. Hey, listen, I gotta go. Can I call you later?

KATE	Okay.

CHRISTINA RILEY	Doing the shopping now? 

JAMES	Just helping out. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	Do you need a hand? 

JAMES	No thanks. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	Just trying to be neighborly.

JAMES	Is that what you call it when you're targeting Reed Mill customers? 

CHRISTINA RILEY	That's just business, James. That's healthy competition. Think about this logically.  Do you really want to keep crawling down a dead end? This is not good for your family and they cannot afford it.

JAMES	We'll see. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	Alright.

PAIGE	Hey.

JAMES	Hey. 

PAIGE	Thanks for the ride yesterday. 

JAMES	Yeah, no problem. How's the car running? 

PAIGE	Running. 

JAMES	Good.

PAIGE	I'm making cinnamon rolls. Come try one later? 

JAMES	Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.

TOM	Just can't help yourself, can you? 

JAMES	What? 

TOM	With Paige. Chasing after her even though you've got a girlfriend. 

JAMES	I'm not chasing after Paige. 

TOM	Then leave her alone! 

JAMES	Why? Because you like her? Then do something about it.

TOM	That didn't work too well last time. You'd already gotten in the way. 

JAMES	What do you want, Tom? 

TOM	I want you gone. Out of here, before you ruin my life again. 

JAMES	Before I ruin your. . .

JAMES	Fine. Consider me gone.

JAMES	Do you have anything leaving tonight? And how long's the layover? The morning flight then. Yes, please. You have the credit card?

HENRY 	That wheel acting up again? 

JAMES	Yeah, it just needs to be balanced.

HENRY 	I heard you're leaving. 

HENRY 	Lindsay. I assume this has something to do with Tom?

JAMES	Just time to go. 

HENRY 	We need you.

JAMES	Mom doesn't seem to worried about it, with Christina Riley stealing all the guests. Burying her head in the sand. 

HENRY 	She's plenty worried, believe me. She's just got a lot on her plate right now.

HENRY 	Hey, what would you do?

JAMES	Doesn't matter. It doesn't affect me. 

HENRY 	Because you're leaving again.

JAMES	You know, I left for Tom's sake last time. Even though I loved Anna, I left. And this is the thanks I get. He blames me for stealing her, for moving away, for coming back. 

HENRY 	Yeah.

JAMES	Just because Anna ended up moving away doesn't mean that I stole her. I haven't talked to her since I left. 

HENRY 	Anna loved you, you know, not Tom. 

JAMES	It doesn't matter to him.

HENRY 	But it matters to you. 

JAMES	I let it go. I've got my life to get back to. 

HENRY 	Hey, do something for me, will ya?

HENRY 	Don't let his hard feelings affect you. Love him, even if he makes it difficult.

JAMES	You know the whole brotherly love thing works better from afar.

BARBARA	 Henry!

BARBARA	Henry!

TOM	Dad!

LINDSAY	Mom is he breathing?

JAMES	 Lindsay, go call 911, hurry!

TOM	There's no pulse, Mom.

JAMES	Come on, Dad. He's not breathing.

TOM	Stay with us, Dad, come on!

BARBARA	Henry, please!

TOM	We'll be in the car.

CHRISTINA RILEY	Sorry for your loss. He was a good man.

JAMES	I didn't think you actually knew him.

CHRISTINA RILEY	Well, not well, but maybe in time. If we had talked about Reed Mill and all.

JAMES	Do you really think now is the time for this?

CHRISTINA RILEY	What better time? You have some big decisions to make and this is one of them.

JAMES	Yeah.

CHRISTINA RILEY	You don't really want to stay here and run a bed and breakfast, do you?

JAMES	That's my business.

CHRISTINA RILEY	But you need a life.

JAMES	I have a life.

CHRISTINA RILEY	And you want to get back to it, don't you?  You have to do what's right for your family. Itmay be a hard pill to swallow, but it's the right thing.

TOM	Want some juice, Mom?

BARBARA	No, thank you.

TOM	What are you doing?

BARBARA	Trying to see who we can afford to hire.

TOM	Found anyone yet?

BARBARA	I don't even know how we're going to pay them.

TOM	Do we need anyone else?

BARBARA	Jimmy has to go back soon.

TOM	Business is slow right now anyway. I think we can handle it.

BARBARA	But we need more business just to make ends meet.

TOM	It'll pick up.

JAMES	Not with Christina undercutting our rates.

TOM	What do you care?

JAMES	Mom, maybe it makes sense to take her offer seriously.

TOM	Don't listen to him, Mom.

BARBARA	We're not selling, Jimmy.

JAMES	Well, how do you expect to do it without Dad? I mean the offer's not great, but. . .

BARBARA	Jimmy, we're under water on the loans.

TOM	Is it really that bad?

JAMES	Well, isn't Riley's offer enough to. . .

HENRY	It's not. And it doesn't matter. This is our home.

JAMES	Alright, how bad is it really?

JAMES	You're not even turning a profit.

BARBARA	You asked.

JAMES	Mom, how do you expect to turn things around if you can't. . . I can't stay much longer. 

BARBARA	I know.

PAIGE	James, there's a phone call for you.

TOM	I knew we couldn't count on him.

JAMES	This is James. 

DAWSON	Sorry to hear about your father. How are you holding up?

JAMES	I'm okay. 

DAWSON	Good. I talked with Nathan Redding today. Things have calmed down and he sends his thanks. 

JAMES	I'm glad to hear it. 

DAWSON	Look, I don't want to rush you, but when can we expect you back? 

JAMES	I'm trying to figure that out right now. 

DAWSON	I have something better in mind for you here. 

JAMES	Yeah?

DAWSON	Something more along the strategic side. I think you'll like it. 

JAMES	Okay. Thanks.

DAWSON	We'll talk over the particulars when you get back. 

JAMES	Sounds good.

PAIGE	You're smiling.

JAMES	Yeah. 

PAIGE	That doesn't happen that much. 

JAMES	My boss. It looks like I'm getting a promotion.

PAIGE	Congratulations. 

JAMES	Thank you. 

PAIGE	That's great.

JAMES	Reed Mill Bed & Breakfast, how may I help you? Yeah. It's for you.

PAIGE	Hello? 

LINDSAY	Okay. No, I'm sorry. I'm. . . okay. Yeah, I'll be right there. 

JAMES	What's wrong? 

PAIGE	I gotta go. 

JAMES	Paige!

PAIGE	Oh, come on! 

JAMES	Paige.

PAIGE	Give me a break! 

JAMES	I can take you wherever you need to go.

PAIGE	No, it's okay.

JAMES	Please. Come on.

PAIGE	Thank you for calling.  Mom? Hmm.  Time to go home. 

DORA	I am home.

PAIGE	No you're not. You know where you are? 

DORA	Home.

PAIGE	I can handle this. 

JAMES	It's okay. I don't mind helping. 

PAIGE	You might when she throws up in your rental car.

JAMES	Should we get her something to eat? 

PAIGE	Um, not such a good idea.

JAMES	How about you?

PAIGE	Thanks for dinner.

JAMES	My pleasure. 

PAIGE	You didn't - you didn't have to do this.

JAMES	Actually I did. I was starving. 

PAIGE	Not just the food. You didn't have to come out here. 

JAMES	I'm glad I did.

JAMES	So your car, the fender bender. . .

PAIGE	Yeah. 

JAMES	That's why you stayed. Your mom?

PAIGE	I had to. 

JAMES	What about rehab or something?

PAIGE	Can't afford it. Not sure she'd go anyway. 

JAMES	I'm sorry, I don't mean to interfere.

PAIGE	You know, parents are suppose to take care of their children, not so much the other way around.

JAMES	I had no idea that you were. . . 

PAIGE	That's okay, I don't like to broadcast it. My Mom does that enough. 

JAMES	How are things between you two?

PAIGE	Um, she's not sober much. 

JAMES	You, uh, ever regret it?

PAIGE	It, uh, gets lonely sometimes. Your family helps. They give me hope. 

JAMES	Really?

PAIGE	Yeah, that not all families are like mine. 

JAMES	No, sometimes they're worse.

PAIGE	Someday you'll think differently.

JAMES	Morning. 

LINDSAY	Morning. 

JAMES	Going to school soon? 

LINDSAY	After morning chores.

JAMES	Do you ever get tired of them, the chores? 

LINDSAY	Not really.

JAMES	I did. 

LINDSAY	I like meeting the different people. And if we move, I'll miss that. 

JAMES	You'll meet new people anywhere you go.

LINDSAY	I know. I just like it here, though. 

JAMES	That's because you've never been anywhere else.

LINDSAY	Exactly.  I guess I'm just scared.

JAMES	Hey. 

PAIGE	Hey.

PAIGE	I wanted to thank you again for everything. It was really nice not to have to do it alone for a change.

JAMES	You're welcome. 

PAIGE	What are you doing out here?

JAMES	Just, reminiscing. I don't remember what time of year it was, spring, summer, whatever, but the fish actually would try to swim up this waterfall. 

PAIGE	Really?

JAMES	We used to stand over there and would try to catch them. 

PAIGE	Did you actually ever get one?

JAMES	No, but to this day Tom still swears that he caught one, but I don't buy it.

PAIGE	You gonna miss it?

JAMES	Dad once asked me what I would do with the Mill if I were in his shoes. 

TOM	Sell it?

JAMES	No, not anymore. It means too much to the family. But you can't expect to keep it without making a few changes. 

BARBARA	Like what? 	

JAMES	Well, even if we sell 75% of the rooms year round we'd still barely be breaking even with all the cost of maintenance and food and wages.

TOM	Yeah, we can't charge anymore than we already are, especially with Christina undercutting our rates all day long. 

JAMES	No, we can't, but we need to start bringing more people in.

TOM	Are you suggesting we build more rooms?  With what money? 

JAMES	I'm suggesting we start putting this place on the map. 

TOM	Advertising? 

JAMES	More than that. I'm talking events. Public and private.

BARBARA	Weddings? 

JAMES	Yes, uh, company parties, anniversary parties, proms.

TOM	Where would we host all this? 

JAMES	We're sitting on 50 acres of land. If the weather's good, we can find a spot.

BARBARA	You know, Vicky Pearson's daughter just got engaged. 

JAMES	Call he. 

TOM	Is this really enough to make a difference?

JAMES	What about a concert? 

BARBARA	Okay.

JAMES	Jump start things around here, get the community involved. 

TOM	Please tell me you're not singing.

JAMES	We'll let the surround towns know about it, and start selling tickets as soon as we can. If it works out, we do it every year. 

BARBARA	Can we afford to bring in a singer? 

TOM	One who will help sell enough tickets?

JAMES	I can cover the expenses with some savings that I have, but for a singer with mass appeal, maybe I'll call in a favor.

JAMES	Nathan. James Reed here. Good, good. Well, I'm glad it's working out. Hey, I know we haven't known each other very long, but I have huge favor to ask of you. 

BARBARA	Did you all have a restful night? 

BREAKFAST GUEST	Yeah, it's really quite and pretty here. 

BARBARA	Thank you. Oh, just so you know, we do host special events, so if you have anything coming up, think about us.

BREAKFAST GUEST	Bridal shower. Yeah. 

BARBARA	The entire place used to be an old flour mill but it was beautifully renovated. We've got ponds, the water wheel, waterfalls. We also have tents and chairs that we can set up in addition to any decor that you've got.

KATE	Hello, this is Kate. 

JAMES	Hey, I need a favor. 

KATE	Oh, you mean in addition to me covering your work load?

JAMES	Yeah. 

KATE	What? 

JAMES	Contacts in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, newspapers, TV, radios, bloggers, the works. 

KATE	Why, what are you working on?

JAMES	A little side project. 

KATE	Okay, and when are you coming home?

JAMES	Not sure. 

KATE	You're not sure? 

JAMES	No, I'm not.

KATE	Okay, first it's, oh, maybe it's just a week, and then it's a couple more days,  and then it's more days, and then you're not sure, so what am I . . . 

JAMES	Kate, my Dad's gone. My family needs me.

KATE	For how long? Dawson's not gonna wait forever. 

JAMES	I know.

KATE	And neither will I. 

JAMES	I've got a lot on my mind. I don't need this right now.

KATE	Is that my answer?

JAMES	That's not what I meant. 

KATE	Sure you didn't.

JAMES	What do you want from me, Kate. 

KATE	Well, I know what I don't want. I don't want to waste my time with someone who has no idea how good he's got it. 

JAMES	Then don't. Just send me the list.

KATE	Fine.

PAIGE	This is the perfect room for the brides. 

LINDSAY	For the bouquet?

PAIGE	Sure. 

LINDSAY	Hey, why do wedding dresses have to be white?

PAIGE	I don't know, tradition? 

LINDSAY	Well, I'd want lilac. 

PAIGE	Lilac?

LINDSAY	Why not?

JAMES	Is my little sister getting married? 

LINDSAY	You're closer to that than I am. 

JAMES	Not really.

PAIGE	What about Kate? 

LINDSAY	Doesn't distance make the heart grow fonder?

JAMES	Well, sometimes it just clears you head a little. 

LINDSAY	What's that?

JAMES	Uh, I just gotta hang these up around town.  You guys wanna help? 

LINDSAY/PAIGE	Sure.

CHRISTINA RILEY	Get me the number for Patrick at the bank.

TOM	Need some help? 

PAIGE	Sure, thanks. 

TOM	Sure. 

PAIGE	So, how are ya? 

TOM	Good enough, thanks. 

PAIGE	Really, or are you just saying that?

TOM	At this very moment, things are perfect.

PAIGE	Perfect, huh? Folding laundry? 

TOM	I like helping you.

JAMES	Tom, Tom. Mom needs us.

TOM	Yeah. Coming.

TOM	What? 

BARBARA	The bank's given me a deadline. 

JAMES	What deadline? 

BARBARA	Your father talked to them a while ago about reducing our payments, a temporary help. But they're taking that away and calling in the difference.

TOM	Can they do that? 

JAMES	Yeah, but why now? 

BARBAR	Someone called them, a buyer.

JAMES	Christina Riley. 

BARBARA	They said that if we don't get back on track they'll have to sell Reed Mill to recoup their money.

TOM	Whatever. They just don't want to miss out on her offer. 

BARBARA	We have less than two weeks to make up our payments. 

JAMES	That's just before the concert.

TOM	How do we stop this? 

BARBARA	We don't have enough events booked, and they're not enough money. . . 

TOM	So we move up the concert. 

JAMES	No, we can't do that, we've already announced the dates and we can't do that to Nathan. 

TOM	The great James can't make a phone call? 

BARBARA	Boys. 

TOM	Without this concert we're finished. 

JAMES	You don't think I know that? 

TOM	I don't know!

JAMES	I'll come up with something.

TOM	You gonna run away again? 

JAMES	Get off my back, Tom. 

TOM	I figured you'd run. Somehow everyone still thinks you're the hero. 

JAMES	I'm not trying to be a hero. I wasn't trying to be one then, I'm not trying to be one now.

TOM	Because you're a coward, that's why you left before.

JAMES	I left so you could have your way. I don't know why you can't see that. 

TOM	Don't try to spin this like you do everything else Mr. PR man. 

JAMES	You always try to make yourself out to be a martyr every time.

TOM	All you do is think about yourself.

JAMES	Get over it! 

TOM	I can't! You're always first! You beat me to Anna, you beat me out of this place. 

JAMES	What are you talking about? 

TOM	You think I want to stay here? 

JAMES	You don't? 

TOM	No! Maybe I want a chance to make something of myself too, to make my own life, and not live under the same roof as my parents. I don't know. . . I don't even know if . . . I just wanted the choice, Jimmy, the choice.

JAMES	Then make it.

PAIGE	Your Mom filled me in.

JAMES	A little warning next time? 

PAIGE	You need any help? 

JAMES	I think I've just about got it.

PAIGE	Were those your soaking wet clothes I found in the dryer?

JAMES	Yeah. 

PAIGE	Maybe next time you and your brother decide to fall in the pond, you could squeeze out that excess water for me? 

JAMES	Sorry.

PAIGE	And you could try swimming instead of fighting.

JAMES	Saw us did you?

JAMES	I used to, you know? 

PAIGE	Fight?

JAMES	Swim, in the pond. It was the highlight of summer. We used to come out here after we finished out chores. 

PAIGE	We? 

JAMES	Me, Tom, and Lindsay when she knew how to swim. 

PAIGE	Hmmm. 

JAMES	What?

PAIGE	You do like it here, don't you?  For all your talk about going home, this is home. 

JAMES	It's where I grew up. I have some good memories here, and some bad ones, that's all.

BARBARA	Uhh.

JAMES	Mom? Are you okay? 

BARBARA	Um, yeah.  I was just. . . I should box this stuff up.

JAMES	No, you don't have to. 

BARBARA	We could use the space, but. . .

JAMES	Mom, maybe it's too soon.

BARBARA	The day before he died we talked about selling the Mill.

JAMES	I thought. . . 

BARBARA	Since we'd all be together, we decided we could start over.  It'd be hard, but we'd try.  But without him, if we left. . . I don't want to lose him.

JAMES	We won't lose him.

TOM	Put things back where you got them. 

JAMES	We have to call the bank.

TOM	And tell them what? 

JAMES	Whatever we have to to get them to move the deadline back after the concert. 

TOM	They're not gonna listen to us over Christina Riley. 

JAMES	How do you know that? 

TOM	You think they would?

JAMES	There has to be someone there, someone that knows us. We've lived in this town for as long as I can remember. That's gotta count for something.

TOM	There is Ben Roswell. 

JAMES	Who? 

TOM	Ben Roswell, I went to school with him.

JAMES	Talk to him. 

TOM	We haven't stayed in touch over the years, but when we see each other in town we say hi. 

JAMES	Talk to him, Tom.

TOM	He may not be able to do anything, or want to. 

JAMES	You have to try. You can do this.

TOM	Okay. 

JAMES	Alright.

LINDSAY	Is he back?

JAMES	Not yet. 

LINDSAY	I told everyone at school about the concert. 

JAMES	Let's hope they all come.

LINDSAY	They're way excited. No one can believe that I know Nathan Redding. 

JAMES	You don't.

LINDSAY	But my brother does, so that counts.

TOM	Got us an extra week.

JAMES	You punk. Nice job.

PAIGE	Reed Mill, how can I help you? Yep, yeah, the concert's here. Saturday. Great.  How many tickets can I get you?
JAMES	Looks good. 

TOM	Thanks, Jimmy. Is this what he's used to?

JAMES	No, but I told him it was a more country fair style concert. 

BARBARA	Jimmy, he's here!

JAMES	Let's go.

JAMES	Nathan. 

NATHAN	James.  Good to see you. 

JAMES	Good to see you.  This is my brother Tom. 

NATHAN	Tom, nice to meet you. 

JAMES	Thanks so much for coming out.

NATHAN	It's a great idea. I don't always hit this part of the country on my tours and you should see the blogs about it being a benefit concert. 

JAMES	Yeah?

NATHAN	Eating it up. Part of your plan, I bet. 

JAMES	Well, I figured it wouldn't hurt, but really, you are just helping me out.

NATHAN	No problem. 

JAMES	Come on, I'll show you your room.

JAMES	 I really do appreciate you doing this. 

NATHAN	No problem.

JAMES	Are you ready for this? 

NATHAN	You bet.

JAMES	Thank you, thank you. Thank you guys, thank you for coming to Reed Mill.  And a big thank you to Nathan Redding. I'm excited to hear him play tonight, so please join me in welcoming Nathan.

NATHAN	Hello, hello, thank you. It's so great to be here. I've got a little something for all you here tonight. 

NATHAN	? You've got me wrapped around your finger, I'm not afraid to say it.  Because I know. . . 

JAMES	What happened? 

TOM	I don't know.

TOM	You've got to be kidding me. I'll handle this.  Go.

JAMES	Sorry, man, we're working on it.

NATHAN	This reminds me of when I first started singing. Me on stage, sometimes not even a stage.  Back then, most people didn't care if I sang or not. I got tips sometimes to stop singing.

NATHAN	But you keep going, you know, something every performer learns.  So let's just use this and take it down a little, shall we?


NATHAN	? I hope there's someone listening because I can only scream so loud. 

JAMES	Don't electrocute yourself. 

TOM	It's not that kind of wire. 

JAMES	How can I help you? 

TOM	I got this. And everyone is talking louder about material things that don't matter. Just not to me.  If I, could have just one thing for this year, it'd be to cry a lot less tears from all the pain.  As we look back at our past. . . 

TOM	Okay. 

JAMES	Yeah?

NATHAN	? Just tell me someone's listening. . . 

JAMES	You did it. 

TOM	Yeah.

JAMES	Hero. 

NATHAN	? For every little thing we're giving. To give the world a smile. And everyone is talking louder about material things that don't matter, least not to me.

TOM	You think it's enough? 

JAMES	Listen to the crowd. It sounds like it.

JAMES	I've been thinking about what you said. About wanting to be on your own. 

TOM	Listen, I was angry, and. . . 

JAMES	You meant it. I think if we get things running smoothly around here, you should do what you want.

TOM	You serious? 

JAMES	Well, give it a few months, but yeah.

TOM	Okay.

NATHAN	? So open up your heart and listen,  because it's time for me to change.  Yeah, if there's one thing we've been missing.  But today. I hope there's someone listening.

NATHAN	Thank you so much! Thank you, thank you!

JAMES	What are you doing here?

CHRISTINA RILEY	Well, don't hold your breath for a congratulations. 

JAMES	From you? I wouldn't dream of it. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	You know this won't last. Reed Mill will just go back to the way it was after you leave. 

JAMES	I guess I better stay then. I wouldn't want my family's home to fall into someone else's hands. 

CHRISTINA RILEY	You're making such a big mistake.

JAMES	ctually, I'm doing exactly what you said. Do what's right for your family even if it's hard to swallow? Isn't that it? Maybe not quite what you wanted, but I guess you can't always have it your way.

BARBARA	Alright, this is your last chance. I will raise my offer by 5%.

JAMES	Consider all of your offers rejected. We're keeping Reed Mill. Now, if you don't mind, these are for the guests.

PAIGE	He is really good.

JAMES	Yeah.

JAMES	Have you seen my Mom? 

PAIGE	Yeah, she's, uh, in the kitchen tallying up ticket sales.

JAMES	Not a moment wasted. 

PAIGE	No. From the crowd's attendance and the look on her face, I think you did it. The Mill's safe.

JAMES	For now. But there's always gonna be something.

PAIGE	And then what? 

JAMES	We'll deal with it as it comes. 

PAIGE	We?

JAMES	All of us, assuming you'll stick around.

PAIGE	I always have. 

JAMES	I know. It's what made me realize that I need to be better. Watching you, it changed me.  I want to be here now, not because I have to, but. . .

PAIGE	because you care. 

JAMES	Yeah.
