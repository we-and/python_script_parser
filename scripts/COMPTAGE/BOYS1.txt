Randy Paret	This is it.

Devon Macharis	Really?

Devon 	Aquadream?

Randy	Yes.

Devon	Never heard of it.

Randy	It's new here.

Devon	Oh.

Devon	Are you going to wait or are you heading back to the office?

Randy	No, I'm going to wait here.

Devon	Here?

Randy	Sure. Watch a movie in the van or something.

Devon	Oh well... Each to their own job, I guess, eh, Randy? (chuckles) See you later.

Randy	Have fun.

Devon	See you.

Randy	Yes.

Randy	(to himself) Randy, man, you're playing with fire.

Randy	(sighs)

Devon	I'm from Kaulille. Cobbenberg, a new district.

Wendy	No, I don’t...

Devon	No? You should visit sometime. (laughs)

Wendy	OK. (laughs)

Devon	Beautiful, isn't it? A beautiful spa. Now that’s craftsmanship. (laughs)

Wendy	(giggles nervously)

Devon	That's a pretty necklace, Wendy. It really is.

Wendy	Thank you. (giggles)

Devon	Selfie?

Wendy	Yes.

Devon	Yes? Don’t forget to smile.

Wendy	Alright. (giggles)

Devon	(to the camera) I always start by taking a photo. Just a snap with my phone. Always fun. You've already touched each other and you've captured a happy moment.

Devon	(to Wendy) Nice, right?

Wendy	Yes, great. (giggles)

Devon	(to the camera) And you'll need that for the next step.

Devon	(to Wendy) Wendy, I'll have to dampen the current mood.

Wendy	Oh dear.

Devon	Because I have to ask for payment first.

Wendy	Yes, of course.

Devon	I know, it makes it feel cold and unfriendly, but once that's out of the way, we don't have to think about it anymore and we can fully focus on each other.

Wendy	Yes.

Devon	(to the camera) Standard phrase. Short and quick, get it over with. And now it's time to fuck.

Devon	Come on, jump in.

Wendy	No.

Devon	Why not?

Wendy	I’m scared.

Devon	You can stand here, you know.

Wendy	You won't think I'm pretty.

Devon	Come on now...

Devon	Hey, Wendy. Come here. Take it easy. We've got all the time in the world.

Devon	(to the camera) This often happens in saunas.

Devon	(to Wendy) Touching is allowed. (laughs)

Wendy	(laughs)

Devon	Grab me tight. (laughs)

Wendy	(laughs)
Devon	I have an idea.

Wendy	What are you going to do?

Devon	Hup. Hey.

Wendy	(laughs nervously)

Devon and Wendy	(kiss)

Wendy	(laughs)

Wendy	(takes a deep breath)

Wendy	(breathes quickly, laughs)

Devon	(spits water out)

Wendy and Devon	(giggle)

Devon	(teasingly) Wendy.

Devon	What's your record for holding your breath?

Wendy	No idea. I always get water up my nose.

Devon	(giggles) Oh dear. Mine is '".

Wendy	(startles) Oh.

Randy	Mieke.

Mieke	Hi, Randy.

Mieke	You’re tall.

Randy	Oh. Thank you.

Randy	You too.

Mieke	I'm standing on the doorstep.

Randy	(laughs)

Mieke	Come in.

Randy	Yes. Oh, Mieke, I just wanted to say, I've only come to talk.

Mieke	Yes, you said that already. Come in.

Wendy	(panting faster and faster)

Wendy	Stop. (pants)

Devon	Hey, what's the matter?

Wendy	(breathes quickly) I booked you for two hours. On the website it said that includes one massage and two orgasms.

Devon	Correct.

Wendy	(breathes quickly) If I had come now, would that have counted as one of the two orgasms?

Devon	Yes, I suppose, yes.

Wendy	(breathes quickly) I’m glad I stopped you then. First I want a massage and then I want two orgasms. First a vaginal one and then a clitoral one.

Devon	OK.

Wendy	And in that order.

Devon	Sure.

Devon	(to the camera) Never forget what you are.

Devon	(to Wendy) Where are you going?

Wendy	To the toilet. I think I had some bad mince for lunch.

Devon	OK, Wendy.

Devon	(to the camera) A product someone has paid money for.

Devon	(shouts at Wendy) Will you shower after going to the toilet?

Wendy	Yes.

Devon	Thank you.

Devon	(to the camera) You're a product, but not a cleaning product.

Jay	(sighs) Good morning, Devon.

Jay	(kisses Devon) Will you do my hair later?

Devon	Sure.

Jay	(annoyedly) Come on. (sighs)

Jay	Good morning, Randy. (kisses Randy) Everything OK?

Randy	Yes.

Jay	(sighs deeply) Where’s Wes?

Randy	In the toilet.

Jay	Red or green?

Randy	The green one is yours.

Jay	Green.

Jay	You only need the whites, right, Randy?

Randy	I didn't get that, Jay.

Jay	The eggs. You only eat the whites, right?

Randy	The egg whites are for Devon.

Jay	Can I have some yokes to put on my bun?

Randy	Of course.

Jay	I love an egg. In China, they bury their eggs to...

Randy	Callboys, good morning, Randy speaking. Hi, Myriam.

Jay	Myriam... (chuckles)

Randy	Devon for tomorrow night? I will take a look.

Randy	Ehm, no. No, he's not available.

Randy	Wes?

Randy	Ehm, no, Wes isn't available either.

Randy	Yes, I know. (chuckles)

Randy	May I recommend Jay to you?

Randy	He's got a ponytail, yes.

Randy	No?

Randy	No. OK, no problem. No, of course. Bye, madam. Bye.

Jay	Thanks.

Jay	What did she say?

Randy	Ehm, she was going to look at her calendar.

Jay	About me, I mean.

Randy	Nothing.

Jay	She must have said something.

Randy	No, just that you're not her type.

Jay	She didn't say "eww" or she didn't laugh or anything like that?

Randy	No.

Jay	Oh well... (sighs)

Jay	It happens.

Randy	Yes.

Devon	Guys, great workout. (laughs)

Randy	Someone just called for you.

Devon	When for?

Randy	Tomorrow night.

Devon	Was I available?

Randy	No.

Devon	Can't you go, Jay?

Jay	Not her type.

Devon	Hm?

Jay	Not her type.

Devon	Oh dear.

Jay	What?

Devon	Is that what she said?

Jay	Yes. It happens, doesn’t it?

Devon	Sure, it happens.

Devon	Mmm. Wow, Randy, this is delicious. But what's in it?

Randy	Beetroot, celery and rhubarb.

Devon	Rhubarb. Rhubarb.

Randy	That's the stalk.

Devon	Yes, I know. I know rhubarb. I just like the word. Rhubarb. (laughs)

Devon	Snail's shell. (laughs)

Randy	(chuckles)

Devon	That's another one. And eel.

Randy	Eel. (chuckles)

Jay	The opposite has happened before.

Devon	What?

Jay	That someone called to book me and I was busy, so you were recommended and they said no.

Devon	I don't know.

Jay	It has happened.

Devon	Randy, has that happened before?

Randy	Yes, it probably has.

Wesley Biets	Here he is. Jay Vleugels in the house.

Jay	(kisses) Wesley, good morning.

Wesley	Randy, can you take a look at the toilet? It keeps running again.

Randy	Again? Unbelievable.

Wesley	Hold on. What are we doing?

Randy	Like you said, taking a look at the toilet.

Wesley	Take it easy and eat something first.

Randy	Are you sure?

Wesley	Is something the matter?

Randy	No, nothing, nothing.

Wesley	Take it easy, man.

Randy	Yes. Thank you, Wes.

Wesley	It's OK, Randy.

Wesley	Jay, are you working today?

Randy	Callboys, good morning, Randy speaking.

Jay	Two o’clock, in Bierbeek. You?

Wesley	Sorry?

Jay	You?

Wesley 	Yes, me too. With a couple, this afternoon.

Devon	Fun job, couples.

Randy	Yes, thank you, bye. Guys, that was Maverick. Tomorrow's meeting is off.

Devon	Was that tomorrow?

Wesley	Maverick?

Devon	Wes, Fonda from Maverick. The one I met at the Erotics Fair.

Jay	Fonda?

Devon	You said I could arrange a meeting, Wes.

Jay	(astonishedly) Oh?

Wesley	Yes, I remember now.

Devon	Ah.

Jay	What's this about?

Devon	Dildos.

Jay	(astonishedly) Dildos?

Wesley	You didn't make any promises to these people, right, Devon?

Devon	None at all, Wes. It's just an exploratory meeting to see what the options are.

Jay	What do we need dildos for?

Devon	We'll make them ourselves and sell them on the website.

Jay	Make them ourselves?

Devon	Yes, you make a mould of your dick and they will pour plastic versions of it in Czechoslovakia.

Jay	(outragedly) Excuse me?

Devon	I brought plaster.

Wesley	(angrily) No, Devon. We hadn't decided anything yet. That’s what we agreed.

Jay	(annoyedly) Why didn't I know about this, Randy?

Devon	I discussed it with Wes. He thought it was a good idea.

Wesley	I never said it was a good idea, Devon. I never said that.

Devon	You said it sounded interesting, Wes.

Wesley	Randy?

Randy	Interesting, yes. You did say that.

Jay	(outragedly) So you knew about it too.

Devon	See, you just don't like the idea because it came through me.

Jay	That's got nothing to do with it, Devon.

Devon	This always happens, Jay.

Jay	(raises his voice) I'm not going to stick my penis in plaster and send it to Czechoslovakia. (shouts) Come on!

Wesley	Jay!

Devon	Jay!

Wesley	No one is sticking their penis in plaster before we've spoken to these people.

Devon	Jay! Come on.

Jay	Devon, can you come and do my hair?

Devon	Yes, alright, I'm coming.

Devon	Is it wet yet?

Jay	I can't get the tap open again.

Jay	(sighs) For god's sake.

Jay	(grumbles and swears)

Jay	(shouts frustratedly) Come on. Oldtimer, right? Oldtimer. (continues to shout indistinctly)

Jay	(shouts) Yes! Goddammit!

Randy	We're a little early.

Wesley	Very early?

Randy	Just a little.

Randy	Do you want music on, Wes?

Wesley	Hm?

Randy	Do you want music on?

Wesley	No, it’s OK.
Jay	Rita?

Tania	No, ehm, Tania.

Jay	Oh, apologies. Sorry, Tania.

Rita	Jay?

Jay	Rita?

Jay	Hi, Rita.

Jay	You look great.

Rita	Thank you.

Jay	(kisses her)

Rita	You too.

Jay	Thank you.

Jay	(sighs) Let me get comfy. (chuckles)

Jay	(to the camera) First I calm the lady down. Put her at ease.

Jay	(to Rita) How are you?

Rita	Fine.

Jay	I knew you were going to be blond.

Rita	(chuckles) I'm not a real blonde.

Jay	I knew that too. (laughs)

Rita	(laughs)

Jay	(to the camera) There you go. The ice is broken. Then you bite the bullet.

Jay	(to Rita) You have a beautiful smile.

Rita	Thank you.

Jay	I would like to ask you to pay me first, Rita.

Rita	Yes, of course.

Wesley	What's the matter, Randy?

Randy	I have to tell you something, Wes.

Wesley	What?

Randy	Something I did.
Wesley	Is it serious?

Randy	I think so.

Randy	Will I get angry, Randy?

Wes	I think so, yes.

Wesley	Would you mind telling me later then?

Randy	Of course not.

Wesley	I have a customer. Two even.

Randy	Of course. Sorry, sorry. (stammers) I... I shouldn't dump this on you now.

Wesley	Later. OK?

Randy	OK.

Wes	Will I be very angry?

Randy	I hope not.

Randy	(shouts) Sandra and Hugo!

Jay	There you go.

Rita	What is this?

Jay	A viking coin. For you.

Rita	Is that you?

Jay	Yes.

Rita	Oh right. (laughs)

Jay	(laughs) My name is on it. Turn it around. There you go. Callboys and our phone number.

Rita	Oh right...

Jay	I order them on a Danish website. You send them a photo, and they arrive a week later.

Rita	Really?

Jay	Sure. Two euros a piece.

Rita	(disbelievingly) Ah.

Jay	Fits inside a shopping cart. Can I have it for a minute?

Jay	(to the camera) Time for phase two.

Jay	(to Rita) Where do you think it went?
Rita	(chuckles) I don't know.

Rita	(surprisedly) Oh.

Jay	Gone.

Jay	(to the camera) We've forgotten all about the awkward payment. More than that, the woman has seen your teeth are clean, and you're well-kept down below. Two birds, one stone.

Rita	Wow. That's impressive.

Jay	(chuckles)

Wesley	Thank you.

Hugo	You’re welcome.

Wesley	That’s delicious.

Hugo	Yes.

Wesley	May I ask why you booked me?

Hugo	Well, sir, it’s like this...

Wesley	Sir? Just call me Wes.

Hugo	Wes.

Sandra	Sir ... (chuckles)

Hugo	Ehm, well, here's the deal: it's a joke that has gotten out of hand.

Wesley	Oh dear.

Sandra	It’s not a joke, Hugo.

Hugo	What?

Sandra	No...

Hugo	It’s not a joke, but… it's like this. I turned  two years ago.

Wesley	Congratulations.

Hugo	(chuckles) Thank you.

Hugo	And Sandra said: For your birthday you can ask me anything you want. I said: Anything? Yes, she said, anything.

Hugo	So I said I wanted to have sex with another woman. As a joke. For a laugh. Do you know what she said? 'OK, you can'.

Wesley	Really?

Sandra	Yes. (laughs)

Hugo	(laughs)

Hugo	But it was a joke. Yes, you can, she said.

Wesley	So?

Hugo	We called an escort.

Wesley	Who?

Hugo	Jessica.

Wesley	I don’t know her.

Hugo	Yes, on the internet. We looked for her together.

Hugo	Gorgeous woman.

Sandra	Yes, a very beautiful woman.

Hugo	Yes, yes.

Sandra	Very well-kept. It was actually a great experience.

Hugo	Great. Beautiful memories.

Wesley	Did you join in, Sandra?

Hugo	No.

Sandra	A little bit at the start.

Hugo	What?

Sandra	I did.

Wesley	But it wasn't your cup of tea?

Sandra	No, not really. And Hugo was more focused on her, so...

Hugo	Maybe...

Sandra	You were, Hugo.	

Hugo	Oh well...

Sandra	I understand. She could do things I had never seen before. It was really…

Hugo	Great talent.

Sandra	I watched them for a little while, but then I left them to it.

Hugo	Wes, Wes, do you know prostate massaging?

Wesley	(chuckles) Of course I do, Hugo.

Hugo	(laughs) I hadn't... That’s with the finger, right?

Wesley	Yes, with the finger.

Hugo	I had never heard of it. I thought, what's that? Wow. Never experienced it before.

Wesley	It is fun.

Hugo	Yes. (laughs)

Hugo	Jessica... (chuckles)

Sandra	But...

Wesley	Ah, there is a 'but' coming.

Sandra	(laughs nervously) But the deal was that when I turned ... I could do the same.

Sandra	So...

Wesley	And you want to let me know in advance or...

Wesley	That's not now, is it?

Hugo	Yes, it is.

Wesley	Are you , Sandra?

Sandra	Since yesterday.

Wesley	No way.

Sandra	I am.

Wesley	There is no way.

Sandra	Yes, I am.

Hugo	For sure.

Wesley	Come on...

Wesley	Happy birthday.

Wesley	(kisses Sandra)


Wesley	That's a great story. I've never heard that before. And I've been with a lot of couples.

Sandra	Really?

Wesley	Thirty percent of my clients are couples, Sandra.

Sandra	Wow, that many.

Hugo	My god.

Wesley	You're not the only ones.

Sandra	(chuckles)


Wesley	Shall we set some boundaries before we go on?

Hugo	Oh, yes.

Wesley	What are your plans, Hugo?

Hugo	(hesitantly) Well, ehm... Is filming allowed?

Wesley	No filming. That's on the website, Hugo.

Hugo	Oh right. Yes, ehm...

Hugo	Watching?

Wesley	(chuckles) Watching is allowed. I allow it, at least. Is that OK with you, Sandra?

Sandra	Yes, you can watch.

Hugo	Yes?

Wesley	That’s what most men do, Hugo.

Hugo	Yes.

Wesley	Some will masturbate.

Hugo	Oh, that's allowed, too?

Wesley	This is your home, Hugo. You can do whatever you want as long as you don't touch me and you don't disturb Sandra.

Hugo	OK. Yes.

Wesley	(chuckles)

Hugo	Right then. I will go upstairs so you two can get to know each other better.

Sandra	Yes.

Hugo	And maybe you could join me in fifteen minutes or so?

Wesley	Fifteen minutes?

Hugo	Yes.

Wesley	Here. I will set my timer, so we don't lose track of time.

Hugo	(laughs) A timer.

Wesley	Is that seat next to you free?

Sandra	It is now.

Wesley	Hello, 'madam'.

Sandra	(chuckles) Hello, 'sir'.

Wesley	(chuckles)

Wesley and Sandra	(kiss)

Devon	(groans)

Devon	(exhales heavily)

Randy	Hi, Devon.

Devon	Hi Randy, right on time. Can you be my spotter for my bench presses?

Randy	Yes, fine.

Devon	Are you OK?

Randy.	Sure. Is it a lot?

Devon	Two times ten... (indistinct)

Sandra and Wesley	(laugh)

Rita	…rubbing and squeezing my nipples... And they're on their backs before you know it.

Jay	They have no stamina. People don't exercise enough.

Rita	(sighs) I was fed up. So I called an escort one day.

Jay	And here I am.

Rita	No, not you.

Jay	What do you mean?

Rita	You’re the third one.

Jay	Number three.

Rita	I hope you perform a lot better than those other two clowns.

Jay	I think someone will be happy she called the Callboys.

Rita	The last one was the worst.

Jay	Who was that?

Rita	Miguel was his name.

Jay	Miguel, don't know him.

Rita	I met him here too. He came in and was texting on his phone.

Jay	(laughs) Typical.

Rita	He sat down and he just carried on.

Jay	Right.

Rita	The worst thing was he had lettuce and meat stuck in his teeth.

Jay	Yuck, you’re kidding me.

Rita	Hm.

Jay	From his dinner?

Rita 	Yes.

Jay	Probably a burger.

Rita	Maybe.

Jay	Or a döner kebab.

Rita	I don’t know. (chuckles)

Jay	Or a dürüm wrap.

Jay	So what did you do?

Rita	I very politely said I didn't feel any chemistry and I would pay him for an hour.

Jay	(sighs) No, no. Just pay for the gas.

Rita	Eh?

Jay	Just pay for gasoline if you want to back out straight away.

Rita	He wanted four hours.	

Jay	Excuse me?

Rita	He had cleared his schedule for me.

Jay	Did you pay that?

Rita	Yes.

Jay	Disgraceful!

Jay	What was this guy's name?

Rita	Miguel.

Jay	Did you keep his number?

Rita	I think so.

Jay	Give it to me later.

Rita	Why?

Jay	(annoyedly) Because Miguel will get a phone call later from one Jay Vleugels that will make him piss out of his ass for weeks.

Jay	Sorry, Rita. Those kinds of bastards get under my skin. We have to weed them out.

Jay	The sort of damage we have to repair when such a pig has gone before us, you wouldn't believe it. It's a drama sometimes.

Jay	(deep sigh, frustratedly) Come on, let's get back in the mood.

Rita	(laughs) Yes.

Jay	I think it's time for another magic trick.

Rita	Oh dear.

Jay	But for this one, I will need a room and a bed.

Jay	(chuckles) That's a room.

Rita	Are you going to saw me in half, Jay?

Jay	I won't saw you, Rita. Not that, no. (giggles)

Rita	(giggles)

Randy	Come on. One, push.

Devon	(exhales heavily)

Randy	Two, push.

Devon	(exhales heavily)

Devon	(exhales heavily)

Randy	Three.

Devon	(exhales heavily)

Randy	Four.

Devon	Why do you keep scratching your balls?

Randy	Ehm... I’ve got an itch.

Devon	How come?

Randy	I don't know. From shaving, I think.

Devon	Did you shave your balls, Randy?

Randy	Yes.

Devon	Why?

Randy	No reason. You guys do it too.

Devon	Was it your first time?

Randy	Yes. It was hard though.	

Devon	You did use shaving cream?

Randy	No, I shaved them dry.

Devon	Randy, no wonder they’re itching. Let me take a look. When was this?

Randy	Last Wednesday.

Devon	Last Wednesday.

Randy	I've had this for a week now.

Devon	Really?

Randy	Yes.

Devon	That can be painful.

Randy	It really hurts.

Devon	Come on.

Randy	(groans) Aww.

Devon	(shockedly) Wow. Ouch, man.

Randy	I know.

Devon	It looks red, man.

Randy	That's from scratching.

Devon	Don't scratch it.

Randy	I know, but it's hard, man.

Devon	You have to use shaving cream or gel.

Randy	Then this won't happen?

Devon	Normally it shouldn't. And I rub them with buffalo ointment after.

Randy	What does that do?

Devon	It softens the skin and it makes them nice and shiny. (chuckles)

Randy	Can I use some?

Devon	Of course, Randy.

Randy	Yes? OK.

Devon	Why have you suddenly started shaving your balls?

Randy	I just think it looks nice.

Devon	Right, nice...

Devon	Do you have a girlfriend?

Devon	Are you kidding? Randy Paret has finally got himself a girlfriend?

Randy	No...

Devon	Hey, come, tell me. Did you poke her? Did you poke her?

Randy	Devon...

Devon	Come on, man. What?

Randy	I think I made a big mistake.

Sandra	(pants softly, moans)

Wesley	Hi, Hugo.

Hugo	Hello.

Wesley	(to the camera) There are four types. First, you have the directors.

director type	Put those legs in your neck. Come on.

director type	And pump it, come on. Pump it. Yes.

Wesley	The second type is the talkers.

talker type	Tore my ligaments while skiing. I couldn't go to the gym anymore, I started drinking, and eating more.

shouter type	(shouts) Is this what you want?!

Wesley	(to the camera) Those are the shouters.

shouter type	(shouts) To get humped by the plumber! Goddammit!	

woman	(moans)

Wesley	And then there's the largest group. Men like Hugo.

Hugo	I'm here, Sandra.

Wesley	That's the men who regret their decision then and there.

Hugo	How’s it going?

Wesley	(to Hugo) I don't think Sandra can talk right now, Hugo.

Hugo	Oh... OK.

Jay	Rita, would you mind if I asked a friend to join us?

Rita	No.

Rita	What’s that?

Jay	You will feel that soon enough.

Rita	(giggles)

Jay	Rita.

Rita	Jay.

Sandra	(moans)

Jay	(moans)

Rita	(moans)

Jay	Abra... ca... dabra!

Rita	(screams)

Jay	(roars)

Sandra	(moans)

Hugo	I will leave you to it then.

Sandra	(moaning) What?

Hugo	I said: I will leave you to it.

Sandra	(moaning) Yes.

Wesley and Sandra	(pant and moan)

Hugo	I had prepared a cheeseboard for after. With some bread?

Sandra	Hugo, there won't be time for that.

Hugo	No.

Wesley and Sandra	(moan)

Devon	(sighs)

Devon	Hey...

Devon	Hang in there.

Randy	Sure.

Devon	How are your balls now?

Randy	They're not itching so much anymore.

Devon	There you go. It will be OK, alright?

Randy	Thanks, Devon.

Devon	A pleasure.

Devon	(shouts) Be careful on the road!

Devon	Fuck, man. (long sigh)

Randy	What's this?

Wesley	Cheese.

Randy	Cheese?

Randy	Was everything alright?

Wesley	(sighs) Yes. She was, but he wasn't really.

Randy	Oh, was he...

Wesley	So, what did you want to tell me earlier?

Randy	Ehm, can we go for a drink somewhere, Wes?

Wesley	Yes, that’s fine.

Randy	OK.

Jay	When will we see each other again?

Rita	Who says we'll see each other again?


Jay	(chuckles) I do. Jay Vleugels does.

Rita	I haven’t decided yet.

Jay	Oh yes, you have, Rita.


Jay	(kisses Rita) Yes, you have.

Jay	And give me that dirtbag's number too.

Rita	Miguel’s?

Jay	Miguel, yes.

Jay	Pig.

English-speaking sports commentator on laptop	.... miles an hour on the course. He goes into that first corner. That's a skill speed...

Miguel	(makes eating noises)

Randy	Excuse me.

Miguel	Miguel speaking.

Jay	(on the phone) Yes, hello. This is Jay Vleugels from the Callboys.

Miguel	Who?

Jay	(on screen) Jay Vleugels.

Miguel	(on the phone) Don’t know him.

Jay	(on screen) You will get to know him, pal, because he's going to teach you a lesson.

Miguel	(on screen) Go ahead.

Jay	(on the phone) Yes, this afternoon a fantastic lady (on screen) told me that... Hello? Hello? Dammit. Like that, are we?

Randy	I went to see a client.

Miguel	Yes, what is it?

Jay	(on screen) (shouts) Don't try that again, pal!

Miguel	Oh, but I will.

Jay	(on the phone) Really?
Miguel	If you've got a complaint, speak to my voice mail.

Jay	(laughs loudly, on screen)

Jay	(angrily) Oh boy, oh boy.

Randy	Thank you.

Randy	It wasn't the first time someone asked me, Wes. But I have always refused. But this Mieke lived near the sauna where I dropped Devon off.

Randy	I had to wait for two hours and before I knew it, I heard myself say yes.

Wesley	On behalf of the Callboys?

Randy	Yes. (sobs) Sorry, Wes.

Wesley	What exactly happened?

Randy	Nothing. Nothing at all. We just talked. I had a drink. Just a glass of water.

Wesley	Did she pay you?

Randy	She wanted to, but I said no. Then I drove back to the sauna to pick up Devon.

Wesley	Is that all?

Wesley	Randy?

Randy	Mieke asked me if we could meet up again. For longer this time.

Wesley	A booking?

Randy	A booking... Yes.

Jay (on voice mail)	(shouts) ...filthy pigs like you. I will punch you in the face. I’m going to hang up now, because you’re not worth my advice and definitely not…

text on laptop	Jay Vleugels Callboys

Miguel	(laughs)

Wesley	How long have you been working for us, Randy?

Randy	Six months. The best months of my life.

Wesley	That’s nice to hear.

Wesley	But we didn't hire you for the clients. Hm? We hired you for ourselves.

Randy	I know.

Wesley	And it will stay that way for now. OK.

Wesley	What did you tell that woman?

Randy	That I would discuss it with you guys first.

Wesley	We're not going to do that.

Randy	No?

Wesley	No. You told me. And we will keep it between us. Hm?

Wesley	Randy Paret?

Devon	Hey, Jay-man.

Jay	Devon.

Devon	How was it?

Jay	Very nice. Fantastic lady.

Jay	You know how sometimes you just feel you're on the same wavelength?

Devon	Yes, that’s nice.

Jay	That's what it was like. It was great. New booking in two weeks' time.

Devon	Great. (laughs) Good.

Jay	She told me this story. Do you happen to know an escort called Miguel?

Devon	Miguel? No.

Jay	A pig.

Devon	Really? Why is that?

Jay	How much would you charge if a woman calls the date off right away?

Devon	Well… (inhales)

Jay	Just the gas money, right?

Devon	No idea. That’s never happened to me, so...

Jay	(stammers) To me neither, but imagine if it did. I would only charge the gas money.

Jay	That bastard wanted  euros.

Devon	What?

Jay	I called him up straight away. On behalf of the Callboys.

Devon	And?

Jay	The coward doesn’t have the balls to pick up, but I shat all over his voice mail.

Devon	Miguel’s?

Jay	What an asshole.

Devon	Wow, man.

Jay	Where is Wes?

Devon	Randy went to pick him up. Here, this is him now.

Devon	Hi, Wes.

Wesley	Devon, is Jay back yet?

Devon	Yes, he just walked in.


Wesley	(on the phone) OK, Devon, (on screen) Randy told you something earlier, right?

Devon	(on the phone) The thing about his balls?

Wesley	What?

Devon	(on the phone) About his balls.

Randy	I shaved my balls.

Wesley	(on screen) No, not about his balls. (on the phone) About the client he visited.

Devon	Oh right.

Wesley	Could you please not tell Jay about it yet?

Devon	Don't tell Jay yet, OK.

Wesley	Devon?

Devon	Yes?

Wesley	Did Jay hear what you just said?

Devon	Yes?	

Wesley	We'll be there soon.

Devon	(on the phone) Yo, Wes.

Wesley	Goddammit.

Jay	What shouldn't you tell Jay?

Devon	(stammers) Well, that’s...

Randy	Will Jay be angry?

Wesley	He's about to get angry right now, yes.

Randy	(breathes nervously)

Wesley	Hey. It will be alright, Randy. I’ll manage it, buddy. I’ll manage it.

Jay	If we're going to start with 'this one says that to this one but not to that one', then we might as well quit, Wes.

Wesley	Jay, sit down.

Jay	Yes, I mean it. Then I’m done.

Devon	If someone asks me to keep something to myself, I do so.

Jay	Me too.

Devon	So? Then don't threaten me into telling you.

Jay	I didn't, did I?

Devon	Come on.

Jay	No.

Devon	(raises his voice) You slammed your helmet on the table, Jay.

Jay	You call that a threat?

Devon	Yes, that is a threat.

Jay	At least it's not done behind your back.

Wesley	Nobody is doing anything behind your back, Jay. If you'd been here first, Randy would have told you instead.

Randy	Yes, that's true, Jay.

Jay	Told me what?

Wesley	There you go. Finally.

Jay	Told me what, Wes?

Wesley	Randy made a mistake and was honest enough to tell me about it.

Devon	And me.

Wesley	Devon...

Jay	Something to do with the car?

Wesley	No.

Wesley	Randy went to visit a client.

Jay	(shouts) What?

Wesley	Stay calm, Jay.

Devon	I knew it already.

Wesley	He sat on the couch with her, he drank a glass of water and they talked. Did Randy make a mistake? Yes, he did. And he knows that.

Wesley	He would like to apologize to us. Randy.

Randy	I would very much like to apologize to you.

Devon	Accepted.

Wesley	And he's asking us, not me, not Devon or you, Jay, but us, the Callboys, for our permission to see Mieke again.

Jay	(laughs) Right...

Wesley	Yes, Jay, yes.

Wesley	Not at his request, but at hers.

Jay	Randy, would you mind going outside for a minute?

Randy	Why?

Jay	Because I'm going to say nasty things about you, and I don't want youto hear them.

Randy	Yes, of course.

Jay	Thank you.

Randy	I will wait in the car.

Jay	Yes. For example.

Wesley	(sighs deeply)

Jay	(sighs)

Jay	Did I happen to miss a meeting?

Jay	Are there suddenly four of us?

Wesley	(annoyedly) No, Jay.

Devon	Jay, the boy just wants to fuck.

Jay	He is allowed to fuck, but not with a client.

Devon	No.

Jay	And not in our name.

Devon	Wes, Jay is right in that respect.

Jay	There we are. So...

Devon	Yes, so...what you said.

Wesley	I called Mieke. A very nice lady. She knows what she's doing.

Wesley	And she was looking forward to getting to know Randy a little bit better.

Devon	To fuck him this time.

Wesley	We didn't even discuss that, Devon.

Jay	Look, he can drive the car, take the bookings and do the washing, but how can you send him to clients?

Wesley	But the client wants...

Randy	Mieke, it's Randy.

Mieke	(on the phone) Randy, how are you?

Randy	Not great.

Mieke	(on the phone) Oh, has something happened?

Randy	The shit has hit the fan here, Mieke.

Mieke	(on the phone) What shit?

Randy	I think it's better for everyone if we don't see each other again.

Mieke	(on the phone) Why not?

Randy	(more formally) If you do want to use our services, I can recommend Jay, Devon or Wes.

Mieke	(on the phone) Come on, Randy.

Randy	(sad voice) We offer four-hour and two-hour sessions...

Mieke	(hangs up the phone)

Devon	There you go. I vote to let him go and let him fuck.

Jay	And who's next? The bald guy, Rimmer, from downstairs? The fool who designed our website? (chuckles) Your brother?

Jay	They all want to fuck, Wes.

Jay	Here’s another one.

Devon	Who is that?

Jay	Miguel.

Wesley	Who is Miguel?

Jay	A pig.	

Devon	Answer it then.

Jay	Alright.

Jay	Hello.

Jay	Yes. And you are Miguel.

Wesley	Who is that?

Devon	An escort.

Jay	(raises his voice) Because you're an asshole. And because I had a fantastic day with a great lady who told me you ripped her off.

Wesley	Jay, who is that?

Jay	Shhh!

Jay	Of course you don't know what I’m talking about. Because you're a pig. And you can count your lucky stars we're talking on the phone, or you would have no teeth left to stick your filth in. Got it?

Jay	Huh? What? Where?

Jay	Goddammit.

Devon	What?

Jay	He's on the driveway.

Jay	(shouts) That’s great, pal. Count me in! I'm coming down, pal!

Wesley	What are you doing, Jay?

Jay	I’m going to kick that slob's balls back in his belly.

Devon	I'm coming with you, Jay.

Jay	No, Devon. It's between me and him. Man to man. (exhales nervously)

Wesley	What is all this about?

Miguel	(breathes heavily with anger)

Jay	Asshole.

Miguel	(shouts) There you are! Come on, tell me to my face this time!

Jay	(shouts) What do you want to hear? That you're a thief? You're a thief, pal!

Jay	(shouts) That you're a filthy pig? Even now you've got crap stuck in your teeth.

Miguel	(shouts) I have overgrown gums, that’s all! I want to earn some extra cash. Can I? Can I?

Jay	Take it easy, man!

Miguel	Can I?

Jay	Are you on drugs?

Miguel	What?

Jay	Are you on drugs?

Miguel	Drugs? Drugs, drugs, drugs!

Jay	Have you come by car?

Miguel	Yes, and I’m on drugs!

Jay	You're a disgrace!

Miguel	A what?

Jay	A disgrace!

Miguel	A disgrace! I'm a disgrace! A disgrace!

Jay	Say that one more time, pal, and I will break your jaw!

Miguel	Oh, and you seem to need a stick for that!

Jay	I don’t, man! I just brought it in case you were armed!

Miguel	Well, I’m not!

Jay	How was I supposed to know?

Miguel	I just told you!

Jay	Sure, pal! Alright, pal. Let’s do it! Let’s go without! Mano a mano!

Miguel	(chuckles in disbelief)

Miguel	We'll see who the pig is here.

Randy	I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Miguel	Says who?

Randy	Me. Randy Paret.

Miguel	(groans)

Randy	Jay? Jay?

Jay	I'm on the ground?

Randy	You're on the ground, Jay. It's OK.

Wesley	What happened?

Devon	Where did he go?

Randy	He disappeared into the trees.

Devon	Asshole.

Jay	(groans)

Devon	Dammit. (shouts) Don't mess with the Callboys again, you asshole! You won't walk away next time!

Jay	Did he have brass knuckles?

Randy	A stick.

Jay	I knew it.

Jay	Didn't see it coming. Lights out. (sighs)

Jay	Yes.

Jay	Randy, I grant you permission to go and see Maaike.

Randy	Mieke.

Jay	Mieke, yes.

Randy	I've just told her I can't, Jay.

Jay	Even better.

Randy	To each their own job.

Miguel	Hey, Callboys! Bunch of faggots!

Devon	That’s a threat.

all	(sigh)

Devon	Well...

Randy	Oh dear.

Jay	Holy moly.

Miguel	(groans)

Devon	Why did he do that? Straight into the ditch.

Jay	Well, well, well.

Jay	If I ever stoop this low, you should finish me off. Promise me. Promise me.

Devon	Alright.

Wesley	Come on, let's go inside. It's cold out here.

Devon	Filthy rat! (laughs)

Devon	Am I wrong? Rats live in ditches, don’t they?

Jay	Explain that one to me. You are only . meters away from the car, you miss the car and shatter our window instead.

Devon	It was meant for Miguel.

Jay	Unbelievable.

Devon	I didn’t do it on purpose. I threw the stick and it went through the window.

Jay	Take a look. Here, here. Just look at that now. What do you think? Is it bigger than a two euro coin?

Devon	You could just use tinfoil.

Jay	Yes, but....
