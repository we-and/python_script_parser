DR. JAMISON	How are you feeling about The Group Show tonight?

NOLA	I feel vulnerable. My name is attached to these Paintings. My Street Campaign is like my Alter Ego. It was created out of my Assault and the whole thing about being judged on my Art never crossed my mind with that work. 

DR. JAMISON	Would you feel less vulnerable if you had included your Street Art in The Group Show?

NOLA	Yeah. Um, “My Name Isn’t” is what brought me here. No, I mean the Assault. And I feel like I’ve moved on from that Pain. It’s not really me anymore. It served its purpose. 

DR. JAMISON	You feel like you can move forward.

NOLA	I mean, Yeah... Right? 

DR. JAMISON	We want to be certain that we can or should... Your Street Campaign is powerful. What are your expectations for Tonight?

NOLA	This Group Show is an amazing opportunity that could shoot me off in the right direction. A serious turning point for me. I want it to put me on the Map. Put me in a Scene where I can talk about my Art with other Artists. I want it to lead to some Serious Sales. I want my work hanging on the walls of Kanye and Michelle Obama... Basically, I gotta a lot at Stake tonight. I could be on the Street the next time you see me... Crazy Girl on the Street making Street Art! Ugh.

DR. JAMISON	Here’s what I’m seeing. You’ve moved on from the “My Name Isn’t” Work, which is fine, but I think you haven’t really embraced it first because there is, understandably, Negativity attached to it. And there might be a slight chance of, I don’t want to call it a problem, of something triggering the assault again. Does that make sense?

NOLA	It does.

DR. JAMISON	Something to think about. Okay. If you start to Panic use your Tools.

NOLA	Thank you.

DR. JAMISON	Have a wonderful Show.

NOLA	I will...

NOLA	...because I didn’t invite those Three.

DR. JAMISON	We probably should have talked about that.

LORINDA	What’s taking so long?

NOLA	They’ll be here any minute.

CLORINDA	You’re cutting it to close. But don’t panic.

NOLA	I’m not panicking.

CLORINDA	Even if it was suppose to be set up days ago.

NOLA	Clo, it wasn’t ready.

MARS	You Da Lady dat ordered dis Freak of Nature?

NOLA	Okay, now I’m panickin’.

CLORINDA	What is it?

NOLA	Uh, I’m on my way.

NOLA	What the Hell is this thing? You said you were gonna get a Cargo Van.


MARS	Cargo Bike. You know I ain’t got no License.

NOLA	Fuck!

MARS	Language Language.

NOLA	C’mon. Help me load this stuff in this Fuckin’ thing. Careful.

MARS	Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. That’s a ‘No Bueno’. You ain’t said nuthin’ ‘bout no Back Breakin’ Work. I’m just here to drop off Da Bike. I gotta get back to Da Shop.

NOLA	I can’t ride this Monster to the Dumbo.

NOLA	Thank you.

MARS	You know it’s only ‘cuz I Fucks wit’ you Hard. Like really Hard. Like really, really, hard.

NOLA	Mars, I ain’t got time for this. I’ll text you the address. And don’t go inside.

MARS	(ad lib)

SHEMEKKA	Hello?

NOLA	Hey.

SHEMEKKA	Hey, Girl.

NOLA	How’s it goin’ with... stuff?

SHEMEKKA	Very good. Tonight’s my Night.

NOLA	Your Night?
 
SHEMEKKA	My Show. My Show’s tonight. Making my debut. You don’t remember?

NOLA	Hold up, hold up. You got your Debut tonight? You didn’t tell me?

SHEMEKKA	Whateva, I told you last week. You comin’ through?

NOLA	I got my Show tonight, too. I guess you’re not coming to mine. It would have been nice to have you there. I’m kind of nervous. When did you book your Show? I know I told you the date of my Show.

SHEMEKKA	Congratulations, Nola. All about you. 

NOLA	It ain’t about me. That’s why I’m calling you... So your Body contouring is good then?

SHEMEKKA	Yeah, I’m actually on Central Park South standing in front of the Doctor’s office now.

NOLA	What happened?

SHEMEKKA	Nothing happened. Why something gotta be happening? I’m just gettin’ a little top off for tonight. I mean, Damn. I thought you called to say Good Luck an’ shit wit’ my Debut tonight.

NOLA	Hold on a second, Shemekka. Can you please not take this street and go straight to Dumbo? (Ad Lib) Okay, Shemekka.

SHEMEKKA	Nah, it’s Cool that you’re not coming tonight. I just don’t want you judging me. That’s like something Clorinda would do.

NOLA	Whatever makes you Happy.

SHEMEKKA	I am. I made myself Happy and I ain’t have to rely on Three Niggas to make that happen.

NOLA	You know what? I gotta go.

MARS	This Shit iz, Futuristical!

CLORINDA	Where is she?
 
MARS	Oh, you.

CLORINDA	Of course it’s me.

MARS	Look, I don’t wanna start a Fight. I’m here because of my Girl, Nola.

CLORINDA	I didn’t ask you all of that. What I would like to know is, what is this giant Chinese Take Out Box doing in here?

MARS	I got Nola’s Art. She’s right behind me in a Cab.

CLORINDA	I hope it’s in one piece.

MARS	I wouldn’t do Nola like that.

CLORINDA	You say that now.

MARS	Damn, you actin’ like you got Two Heads on your Shoulder and one of them is named, Chip.

CLORINDA	You are funny, Mars. I’ll give you that. How’s that working for you? You still living with your Sister?

MARS	Let’s not beat around the Bush here. Let’s get to it and shove it in.

CLORINDA	What? ...Oh, Ewww. You are so uncouth.

MARS	Don’t try to throw big words at me. You takin’ jabs at my Dyslexia?

CLORINDA	If only Dyslexia were your only problem.

MARS	You just jealous ‘cuz I got the baddest Chick in Da Game wearin’ My Chain.

CLORINDA	I really don’t have time for this.

MARS	And you’re also Mad I dumped you and dats Da element in Da Room.

CLORINDA	You didn’t... I... It’s ‘Elephant!’ Not, ‘Element!’ ...You know, what? Why don’t you do Nola a solid and renege on tonight’s invite? Some other time. Ciao!

MARS	Whoah. Whoah. Whoah. Whoah. Whoah.

MARS	Is that what dis is?

NOLA	Mars, I asked you nicely to wait for me out front.

MARS	‘Cuz you didn’t wanna tell me about some shit you got goin’ on here tonight?

CLORINDA	That’s a perfectly sound excuse.

NOLA	Clorinda, please. Mars, I have a lot on my mind with The Show. You don’t have to take it personally.

MARS	How could you ask me to bring your Art over and not expect me to figure out what da Hell is goin’ on here? You think I’m smokin’ K2?

CLORINDA	He’s got a point.

MARS	Are you trying to say I’m Imbeclicclic?

CLORINDA	That’s a Big Word for you. Let me go get you a Cookie.

NOLA	No, No, Mars. I asked you because you are reliable. I knew I could count on you...

MARS	Word?

NOLA	I just needed help at the last minute... after the other thing fell through.

MARS	Ohhh!

CLORINDA	Nola, enough with the Telenovela. We have to hang these... Now.

MARS	Well, at least I hope you had the dic-nity to not invite that other fuckin’ guy you’re seeing.

NOLA	It ain’t about Dudes, Mars. It’s about the Art. 


MARS	I know about Art! You spell it, A. R. T. I look at it and I see a R.A.T. I know that if it don’t move you it ain’t Shit. Art is in da Eye of the Beholder. And I don’t like to Beholden to nobody. You know what I be holdin’? My Johnson. So don’t tell me I can’t Hang ‘cuz  my Ass almost died gettin’ your Art here.

MARS	I’m of the Last Generation to be Hired and the First to be Fired! So Protect Ya Neck when you stickin’ it out for other People!

NOLA	Hey, thank you for getting my Art here. That sounds sarcastic but I mean it... Mars! Mars!

CLORINDA	Now you know why I dumped him.

NOLA	Jesus, what is it with you Two.

CLORINDA	Nobody told you to screw my Ex.

NOLA	I asked you and you said you didn’t care.
 
CLORINDA	I don’t but ‘Fuck a Girl Code,’ right?

CLORINDA	I want you to meet one of my ‘Diastopian’ Artist, Nola Darling.

DEAN	I’m here to represent My Beautiful Peoples. It’s Nation Time, Nation Time.

BELINDA	No, Mother. I’m hungry.

EBONY	I still Breast Feed my Sweet Angel.

BELINDA	That’s why I don’t have any Friends.

EBONY	I said... get... down.

EBONY	Nobody captures the Black Female body like Dean does.

NOLA	Interesting.

EBONY	But I love the way you use those Barbaric Hot Combs and shove them back in Whitey’s face. Ssssss!

NOLA	Not my Work but thank you anyway. I should go over by my Paintings. Nice meeting you, Dean, Ebony. Belinda.

DEAN	DT is president. Nation Time.

CLORINDA	Welcome to the Future. Welcome to the ‘Diastopian.’ It is a Movement of forward thinking Afrocentric Artists reaching across Boundaries to Fabulate, Deconstruct, Redefine, assert and expand the Breadth and Reach of the Millennial Voices of people from African Diaspora. Our Four Young Black Brilliant Artist... The Sculp-Tress, ZORA KNEEL HURTIN.’

DANTON	I like it, I like, I like it.

NOLA	Thank you.

DANTON	Danton Phillips.

NOLA	Nola Darling.

DANTON	Hey, I know I’m old but I just heard Clorinda introduce you. Nice to finally meet you.

CLORINDA	Danton is an Old friend of mine. I told you all about him. A Patron to The Arts.

CLORINDA	What do you think? Hot hunh?

NOLA	I mean, yeah sure, why not.

CLORINDA	... You know you don’t have to stand in front of your Art Work like a Kid selling lemonade. Collectors are as interested in the Artist as they are in the Art. Walk about. Make yourself known.

NOLA	I’m so glad you guys came. Skylar, I loved your Vegan Cookies. Out of this World.

SKYLAR	Aren’t they? Thank you. Oh, and thank you for the Art you made me... You still owe me a Sleep Over, though.

OPAL	...Congratulations. Look at this turn out.

SKYLAR	Awkward, Mom.

SKYLAR	Mom changes the Subject when she doesn’t want to Say No.

NOLA	Yeah, it really is a good turn out. I’m kind of stunned.

SKYLAR	I like your Portrait the Best. This other stuff doesn’t fit with yours.

SKYLAR	What? I’m precocious.

NOLA	Like I said, don’t take it Personal. It’s business. I know you understand that.

STEFANO	Congratulations, Darling.

TERRELL	I thought you forgot about us Little People. How are you holding up?

NOLA	Honestly, I thought I’d be enjoying this more. How does this Opening compare to your First Show?

TERRELL	Yours is so way better. My Show was a Total Disaster.

STEFANO	Oh, please. Nola, He Sold everything within minutes.
