(ICE PRINCESS LILY)

 

SWIFT	Good morning!

KOLK	Good morning!

RABBIT	Good morning, Kolk!

KOLK	Morning!

ARKTOS	Mwahaaahahahaaa...! Tyrion looks at Mythia.

TYRION	Mythia! The egg. Go. I’ll cover you! But... Go!!
 
MYTHIA TYRION	Tyrion turns around to the cloud that follows them.

TYRION	LEAVE MY WIFE ALONE!!

MYTHIA	Ahhh!

TYRION	MYTHIA!!! (shocked reaction) Aaaahhh!

ARKTOS	(more thunder than laughter) Mwahaaahahahaaa...!

KOLK	(startles) Ahh! Mythia! What happened?! (looking around in panic) Where’s Tyrion?

MYTHIA	He’s...

KOLK	No...

MYTHIA	Kolk, you must take our son. He’s the last of his kind.

KOLK	What? No, I can’t, I...Argh!

MYTHIA	Only he can protect Green Land from Arktos. His name is... (with last of her strength) ...Tabaluga.

KOLK	Mythia, please don’t die! (quietly, to himself) Tabaluga. Wait, wait! Hello there, Tabaluga! I’m Kolk. I’ll take good care of you.

TABALUGA	(sneezes) Did you see that?

BULLY	(excitedly) Yeah! There was a flame! This big!

TABALUGA	Finally! A flame!


BULLY	Or this big... (meekly)...or maybe this big? Maybe... some smoke.

TABALUGA	That’s ok… At least I know how it works now

BULLY	You sure this gonna wo—

TABALUGA	(sneezes big time) Atishoooooo! And? But Bully is gone. Um... Bully?

BULLY	(in pain) Argh... I saw a lot. (looking at his slimy hands) But it wasn’t a flame. Sorry.

TABALUGA	I can’t fly properly. I can’t spit fire. I’ll never be a real dragon.
 
KOLK	(consoling, kind) Your fire will come one day.

TABALUGA	(sulky) I don’t have time for patience! Why won’t it happen now?

KOLK	You can’t rush nature, Tabaluga. Now, I need some new herbs from the standing stone. Off you go!

TABALUGA	(heaving a sigh) Fine. If Kolk knows so much about herbs, why can’t he find one that’ll give me fire?

EMRA	(calling out to Tabaluga) Still no fire, eh? I just happen to know a cure for that. It’ll make you a real dragon - guaranteed!

BULLY	Tabaluga IS a real dragon!

EMRA	Not if he can’t spit fire he isn’t. There’s only one cure for firelessness... Nettles!

BULLY	That’s the biggest load of twaddle- bunk I’ve ever...

EMRA	(enticingly) But hey, I totally understand if you don’t want to. They ARE only for dragons, after all...

BULLY	(softly, to Tabaluga) Don’t listen to him. Let’s go.

EMRA AND PALS	(giggle)

BULLY	You’re not actually considering it, are you?

TABALUGA	(with a dismissive wave) What? No. No of course not.

BULLY	Good! Because that would be the stupidest, most idiotic... (to himself) (sigh) Aaaand now he’s gonna scream. On three.	One...

TABALUGA	YAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHH...!

BULLY	(to himself) Okay, on one.

TABALUGA	Ow!

BULLY	(to himself) And a bee swarm on three. One...

TABALUGA	Ah!

BULLY	Well, one again!

TABALUGA	Oweeoweeoweeowee!!!! Water! Ow! Water! Ow! (burbling, incomprehensible) Ow.

BULLY	I don’t want to say I told you so, but...

EMRA	What a performance! Hahahaha!

BULLY	Hey don’t worry, nobody has--

FROG/BEAVER/RABBIT/RABBIT KID	Hehehe--

BULLY	(dead pan) ...seen this.

FROG	(bewildered) He’s never gonna give up, is he?

BEAVER	I know, he is so desperate.

RABBIT KID	That was funny! Can Tabaluga do that again?

RABBIT	Shush!

WEASELS	Hahahahaaaaa!

KOLK	Tabaluga, there you are! What on earth happened to you!? And where are my herbs??

TABALUGA	(dispirited) Ow.

BULLY	There were some, uh, complications.

KOLK	What kind of “complications?”

BULLY	(softly) Emra sort of...tricked him into eating nettles. Told him it’s what dragons did to find their fire.
 
KOLK	And he believed him?!

BULLY	No! Well...yes.

KOLK	(chuckles, sighs) Chin up, Tabaluga. You’ll find your fire, I know it! When your mother put you in my care by...

TABALUGA	(annoyed) ...the standing stone, I know, I know.

KOLK	Yes, she told me that you... (trying to find the right words) ...that you were something special.

TABALUGA	(derisively) I have a special way of making a fool of myself, that’s for sure.

KOLK	One day you’ll –

TABALUGA	One day, one day! You’ve been saying ‘one day’ for years! That’s a lot longer than one day!

KOLK	Where are you going?
 
TABALUGA	To the standing stone to get your stupid herbs. Emra’s right! I’ll never be a real dragon!

BULLY	Emra’s an idiot! I don’t care what anyone says, you’re a real dragon to me. With or without fire!

TABALUGA	Thanks Bully. I just wish I felt that way.


BULLY	Hey you don’t see me worrying about other people’s opinions, do you? (singing) I've got a lease on luck There's just no doubt about it You see the world as black I see a million colors I'm never in a bad mood I think that life is great And I can live on grass when nothing's on my plate (singing) Lucky bug Badu badi bada Lucky bug Badu badu badi bada Lucky bug Badu badi bada I've got a lease on luck I think that life should be fun, yeah!

TABALUGA	Wow!

BULLY	(flattered) Great song, eh? Wrote it myself.

TABALUGA	Unbelievable.

BULLY	(curbing Tabalugas excitement) Oh well, it’s not that great.

TABALUGA	That’s my name! Tabaluga... Fire... Ice Land.

BULLY	(laughing) Look at that - a message for you! I always knew I was a lucky-bug!

TABALUGA	This is where my mother died. This is where she handed me over to Kolk. (touching the inscription) This must be a message from her.

BULLY	You don’t really think that...

TABALUGA	(with a determined look) That’s exactly what I think.

BULLY	Oh, come on, it’s not like it says where you’ll find your - (he looks at the inscription, reads it, thinks about it, resigns) Okay, well maybe it does. But I think that’s open to interpretation. (flies over to Tabaluga) C’mon, you can’t seriously want to go to Ice Land. The Ice Landers are treacherous and...what’s worse than treacherous? Mean! And Arktos is the worst of them all! Kolk said so himself!

TABALUGA	(determined) This is my chance to find my fire.

BULLY	But...but... but...

TABALUGA	Don’t you get it Bully? A dragon with no fire is like, like... a lucky-buck with no luck!
 

BULLY	(sighing) Can’t argue with that logic. But I don’t have to like it!

TABALUGA	I know this is what I’m supposed to do. I feel it deep within me.	Are you in, or not?

BULLY	Pfff... Tabaluga is taken aback.

TABALUGA	(sighs) Oh.

BULLY	I’m in of course!

TABALUGA	Ah, and what’s that?

BULLY	Hello? It’s Ice Land! Emphasis on Ice. Now let’s go before I change my mind! But I’m telling Kolk this was your idea!

TABALUGA	He would understand. (gulps)

BULLY	So, that’s Iceland. Looks not very inviting, eh? (wants to turn around) I think we should better-- (sober) ... fly into the scary cloud without thinking. Finding your ‘fire’ won’t be worth much if you’re dead!

TABALUGA/BULLY	Ahhhh!

TABALUGA	This is Iceland. We really made it.

BULLY	(freezing) Brrrr. (looks to his feet) Huh. So this is snow? Wow! That’s crazy! It’s crunchy and soft all at the same time. Show-off. Ice Landers!

TABALUGA/BULLY	Ahhh!

BULLY	(has to sneaze) Oh. Oh. (SNEEZES!) Oops...

TABALUGA	(scared) They look even worse than I thought.

BULLY	(smug) Finally getting cold feed? Great. Lets go.

TABALUGA	I... I...

LILLI	(singing)

BULLY	What are you waiting fo-- Bully comes back. Ey!

TABALUGA	(in trans) You hear that? It’s beautiful.

BULLY	Wait! Wrong way! (sighs) Hey, what are you doing?

LILLI	(singing)

TABALUGA	Isn’t she the most beautiful creature you’ve ever seen?

BULLY	She’s an Ice Lander! She can probably shoot poison out of her eyes!

TABALUGA	(enthralled) But listen to what comes out of her mouth!

BULLY	Oh, this is not going to end well. I feel it my antennae. And they are never wrong. Especially when they both agree...

TABALUGA/BULLY	WHOOOOAHHHHH!!!!
 
LILLI	Hey! Watch it!!

TABALUGA	Sorry! The ice is slippery and...You sing so... and dance so...and look so...beautifully...(finally slips) Woah! Ouch.

LILLI	Wait! You... you’re a... DRAGON!

TABALUGA	(still dizzy) Yeah. I guess I am.

LILLI	I’ve been waiting for you all my life! For... ME? Yes!

TABALUGA	What is that?

LILLI	(mesmerized) That’s magic. Dragon magic! Like Arktos always said! I have to take you to him right away!

TABALUGA	(jumps in fright) ARKTOS?! But he’s a monster!

LILLI	What? No. Arktos is our protector!

TABALUGA	Really? Hear that, Bully? That doesn’t sound like what Kolk always told us.

LILLI	AAHH! A Green Lander!

BULLY	Leave him alone, Ice Lander girl!

TABALUGA	Whoa whoa whoa! Bully’s my friend!

LILLI	Friend? That’s a Green Lander! He’ll rip your head off with his gaping maw and play football with it!

BULLY	Look who’s talking, Ice Lander! YOU’RE the ones with foot-long fangs and knives for fingers!

TABALUGA	Um...I think we all may have been misinformed.

BULLY	What about that horde of vicious polar bears we saw back there?!

LILLI	You mean, Limbo? Nonsense, he’ll love this! (whistling) Limbo! You gotta see this! It’s a dragon!

TABALUGA/BULLY	Ahhhhhh!

LIMBO	A dragon? Really? I gotta see this with my (very) own ears. Whoa, Lilli... (confused) Uhm... (turns around and sees Lilli) Whoa Lilli, this is the moment you’ve been waiting for! (to Tabaluga) So you can breathe FIRE out of your mouth?! Sometimes weird stuff comes out of my bottom, but not fire. Can you really breathe fire? Oh please,... Pu-lleazze!!!!

BULLY	Ooo-kay, this guy is not dangerous.
 
LIMBO	A Green Lander! AAAHHHHHH!! Don’t rip my head off!!

TABALUGA	(to Limbo) He won’t hurt you, don’t worry. Green Landers aren’t as bad as you think!

LIMBO	(scared) Really?

LILLI	What are a dragon and a Green Lander doing in Iceland anyway?

TABALUGA	Uh, well, uhm, I can...I mean...

BULLY	He’s on a quest to find his fire.

LILLI	One more reason to bring you to Arktos straight away! I’m sure he can help you!

TABALUGA	You think? I don’t know.

BULLY	(whispers suspiciously) Smells like a trap to me.

TABALUGA	(whispers) But look at her. Would she lie to us?
 
LILLI	Trust me! This way.

LIMBO	I’m going too! I can’t leave you on your own with this,... this Green Lander. Who knows what’s in that tiny bug’s tiny mind.

BULLY	(sneers)

LIMBO	Ahh!

BULLY	(hissing to Tabaluga) Look at my antennae! They know something’s not right.

TABALUGA	(sighing, in love) Don’t be so suspicious.

LILLI	(pointing to the forests) Those are the crystal forests. Aren’t they beautiful?

TABALUGA	You sure are. (catching himself) I mean, the forests. (catching himself again) I mean, you too. And your forests are nice too. I mean...

LILLI	I don’t even know your name.

TABALUGA	Neither do I. I mean, uh, Tabaluga!

LILLI	Nice to meet you Tabaluga. I’m Lilli.

TABALUGA	That’s the most beautiful name I’ve ever heard.

LILLI	(smiling) Ah, Limbo, not again.

LIMBO	(scared) Ouuuu... You know I can’t cross that bridge, I’m too scared.

BULLY	Follow me! You can do it! Trust me!

LIMBO	(scared) Trust a Greenlander! I’m done for!

BULLY	Don’t look down! Just look at me!

LIMBO	(scared) What!? I rather look down! (looks down, screams) AHH! I RATHER LOOK UP! (sees Bully again) I’m so doomed!

BULLY	You can do it! Come on! And one, and two and three...!

LIMBO	Ohhh, I knew that bug had a vicious plan!

BULLY	...and four and five and six!

LIMBO	(gives up) Farewell, Lilli!

BULLY	Open your eyes, chicken.

LIMBO	I’m not a chicken, I’m a polar bear!

BULLY	(smug) Vicious plan, eh?

LIMBO	Oh. Uhm... sorry, um, I mean, thanks, um... (cool) Bully.  (smiles sheepish) I’m Limbo.

BULLY	I know, lets go. It’s gonna take hours to get down there.

LILLI	It won’t!

TABALUGA,BULLY,LILLI,LIMBO	Whoo-hoo! Ha ha ha ha ha!

TABALUGA	Huh? Where’s Bully?
 
LIMBO	(digging) Bully! Bully, where are you?

BULLY	Lose something?

LIMBO	Huh?! (relieved laughter)

TABALUGA/BULLY/LILLI/LIMBO	(laugh)

BULLY	Wow.

TABALUGA	Wow!

LILLI	That’s Polaris. Arktos’ palace.

BULLY	Well, it certainly is the kind of a home a dark lord of evil would live in. Kinda ”cold,” don’t you think?

TABALUGA	(insecure) Yeah. Let’s go.

LILLI	(to Tabaluga) Wait. (to Bully) Can you make yourself invisible somehow? It’s just that the Ice Landers have never seen a Green Lander before.

BULLY	How’s that supposed to work? I might be small, but I’m also red, just like...

LIMBO	What? What are you looking at?

BULLY	Are we there , yet?

RABBIT KID	Woa!NA dragon! (run off) Hey look at that! A real Dragon!

CROWDA	HUH? (REACTS)
 
ICE LANDERS	A dragon!/ Incredible! /Just like Arktos said./ etc.

TABALUGA	(whispering) Bully, just look at that. It seems like they were expecting us.

BULLY	I wouldn’t know. All I can see is nose hairs and a pimple.

ICE LANDERS	Ooh! Aah!/ Just look at that!/ A dragon! /So it’s true after all!/ Finally he’s here!

SNOW RABBIT	Arktos is coming!

CROWD	(calling out) Long live Arktos!

ARKTOS	What’s the fuss all about?!

TABALUGA	(gulps in fear)

BULLY	Oh, oh, this guy doesn’t look too friendly. Let’s go home.

TABALUGA	No, this is my only chance.

LILLI	(proud and excited) Arktos! I’ve found one! For real!

ARKTOS	What have you found?

LILLI	And I brought him to you, just as you desired! (turns to Tabaluga) Tabaluga! Come over here!

ARKTOS	A DRAGON! The egg! I knew it!

MIRMEL	MIR MIR!!!

ARKTOS	(tensely cheerful) A dragon! Oh, what a joy.

LILLI	Don’t be afraid, Tabaluga. (to Arktos) Hi.
 
TABALUGA	(sheepish)

LILLI	He’s on a quest for his fire.

ARKTOS	The dragon has no fire? Really, none?!

TABALUGA	No.

ARKTOS	(sympathetically) Oh, that’s extremely (with a nasty smile) ... sad. (jovially to Lilli) Well my little ice crystal, you’ve made me very happy! My dear friend, you’re shuddering as if you’re looking at a monster.

TABALUGA	That’s what everyone calls you in Green Land.

ARKTOS	Oh these awful prejudices. Allow me to prove my friendship and - give you your fire!

TABALUGA	(scared, but hopeful) So you are really the one to help me?
 
ARKTOS	I am, after all, the only one to whom the dragons revealed the secret of their fire before they vanished. (thinking quickly) Beneath my palace lies one of the most secret places: the source of eternal dragon fire.

MIRMEL	Mir-mir? Mir mir!

ARKTOS	Ice Landers! Today is the day I - we - have been waiting so long for! The last dragon has finally found his way back to us! And now, I will bequeath him his fire! (chummily) Follow me, my friend...

BULLY	Ohh, mom’s not gonna like this...

ARKTOS	Welcome to my humble abode. Penguin contractors are a nightmare but I think it turned out quite nice, wouldn’t you agree?
 
BULLY	Yeah. It’s got a real ...homey vibe.

ARKTOS	This way, my friends! I’m afraid only dragons are allowed beyond this point.

LIMBO	But why?

ARKTOS	Because uhm.... (clearly lying)...the eternal dragon fire is very sensitive. If anyone but a dragon enters the cave -- whoosh! Extinguished forever! Dragons only.

MIRMEL	(annoyed) Mir mir.

TABALUGA	I’ll be back before you know it. He looks at Lilli. I promise.

ARKTOS	So, Tabaluga. The very last dragon! You, uh, are the very last dragon, aren’t you?

TABALUGA	(choking up a little) Yeah. I am.

BULLY	Hmmmm, only dragons can enter the cave, right?

LIMBO	Right.

LILLI	Hm. (thinks)

BULLY	‘Cuz, otherwise, the eternal dragon fire will be extinguished forever, right?

LIMBO	Right.

LILLI	(thinks harder) Hm.

BULLY	So, isn’t a bit strange that Arktos is allowed to go inside?
 
LIMBO	Righ-- (realizes) Uh...

BULLY	Does he look like a dragon to you?

LIMBO	(totally dumbfounded) Well, uh...

BULLY	(decisive) That’s it. I’m going after him!

LIMBO	(still sticking to Arktos tale) Wait! Bully! You can’t just-

ARKTOS	Almost there. Just a little further... What are you waiting for, dear boy, an invitation?

TABALUGA	(reverentially) Eternal dragon fire!

ARKTOS	(in a deep voice) That’s right, Tabaluga. Gaze into the flame.

TABALUGA	Why is it blue...?

ARKTOS	(fudges for an excuse) Why, because it’s magical fire of course!

BULLY	Tabaluga!

TABALUGA	(whispers mesmerized) Magical!

BULLY	I’m coming!

TABALUGA	(whispering)  At last! Wait... (inhales with horror) WHAT?! D... D... DRAGONS! All dead!

ARKTOS	Well not all of them...it would seem.

TABALUGA	AAHHH! AAHHH!

BULLY	Taba -

LILLI	Wait! Be careful!

ARKTOS	I can’t tell you, Tabaluga, how pleased I am to have you here at my mercy.

TABALUGA	YOU! You killed my parents!

ARKTOS	Smart little dragon.

LILLI	What?!

ARKTOS	I knew you were out there, so I created some irresistible dragon bait to lure you in.

TABALUGA	D-dragon bait?

ARKTOS	Yes. You might know it by the name...Lilli.

TABALUGA	(GASP!) W-what?

BULLY	What did he say?

LILLI	No! It can’t be. I’m a... dragon trap? My whole life, I trusted Arktos, I...oh no. What have I done?

TABALUGA	Lilli would never do this!

ARKTOS	(smugly) She sure did.

LILLI	Distract Arktos! I’m going in!

LIMBO	(determined) Ok. (a beat) WHAT?!

BULLY	Think of something!

ARKTOS	And now I’m finally going to finish what I started. You will no longer stand in my way. (begins to sing) I am the Lord of light and shadow So white That I will strike you blind (sings) I am a God and you were born to follow I got the power To take your breath away (sings) I am Arktos, king of ice Don't you forget my name I am worse than the Devil, I'm so mean I can turn the fires of hell to steam I am as ancient as the ice That froze before the world had life My black is blacker than the night I am the devil in white Ahhhhh! NO! Muhahahah, That’s exactly how your father looked before he died.

LIMBO	(beatboxing) Boom-chika-chika-wam! Boom... (terribly rapping) I’m just a bear without a care / And I shake my derriere / And I’m not that good at rhyming / But at least I am trying...

BULLY	Hey, Carrot Nose!

ARKTOS	A Greenlander!

BULLY	Fight me! Me and my big mouth. I totally had that! Lemme go!

ARKTOS	Stay here. I’ll be right back.

LILLI	Oh no! Tabaluga, I didn’t know. I had no idea what Arktos was planning. I’ so sorry! You have to believe me! Please! I could never hurt you!Not ever.I swear it!

TABALUGA	Lilli... How did you do that?

LILLI	I don’t know, I... Oh boy.
 
ARKTOS	How dare you!

LIMBO	(beatboxing) Boom-chika-chika-wam! Boom... Argh! by a hair’s breadth. During the chase more and more ice is scraped from Tabaluga’s legs, until at last he can run by himself.

ARKTOS	(panting/frustrated) You are really starting to break my icicles!

TABALUGA	There! Light!

BULLY	(to Tabaluga) What are you waiting for? Fly!

TABALUGA	(to Lilli) Come on, jump on my back!

LILLI	But I’m too heavy for you! Go on without me!

TABALUGA	I’m not leaving without you.

TABALUGA,BULLY,LILLI	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
 
BULLY	No-no-no! I’m too handsome to die!

LILLI	Tabaluga, you are a dragon. And you will fly.

TABALUGA	I’m...I’m doing it! I’m flying! Like, really flying!

BULLY	Where did those come from?

LILLI	Haha, wait until Limbo sees this! (realizing) <GASP!> Oh no - Limbo! We’ve got to go back!

LIMBO	WOO HOO!!! (calling out) Don’t worry about me! I’m ok!
 
BULLY	Glad he made it! (off Tabaluga’s skeptical look) What? I really like the big guy, so sue me.

TABALUGA/BULLY/LILLI	AAAHHHH!

ARKTOS	Very impressive, young dragon. Too bad it will be the last flight you ever take.

BULLY	(screams) You need to fly faster!

TABALUGA	I’m trying!

ARKTOS	You can’t escape me!

TABALUGA	The clouds!

ARKTOS	Where are they?!

TABALUGA	Everyone OK?

BULLY	That depends: am I holding up two fingers or three?

TABALUGA	That’s a tree branch, Bully. I don’t understand why my mother sent me to Iceland if Artkos is that dangerous.

BULLY	Well, did she really? Maybe we got the message wrong.
 
LILLI	So this is...Green Land? There’s no way Arktos could’ve followed us, right?

TABALUGA,BULLY,LILLI	AAHH!

ARKTOS	(hitting each thing) Oh! Ow! Eeeh! Ooh! Ow! Yaaah!

TABALUGA,BULLY,LILLI	 AAHH... What the-
 
ARKTOS	I may not be able to enter Green Land now - but just you wait! You’ll rue the day you crossed Arktos! (laughing and thundering) Mwahahahaaaaa!!!

LILLI/TABALUGA	Phew!

BULLY	Yeah, you better run! (turns around) Come on, guys, lets go home. Green Land’s not so bad after all, is it?

EMRA	Isn’t that... ?

ICE LANDERS	(stunned) Is that Tabaluga? Look at the wings! Wow! He can really fly!

KOLK	(both shocked and relieved) Tabaluga! Where were you? I’ve been looking for you everywhere and-! An Ice Lander?

GREENLANDERS	An Icelander!

KOLK	You have been to Iceland?!

LILLI	(to the others) I’m Lilli. Please don’t be afraid. See? No fangs, no finger-knives.

TABALUGA	I know we weren’t supposed to go to Ice Land but, it seems a lot of what we were told was untrue. They’re just like us.

BULLY	Yeah, they’re actually pretty nice! Except for that Arktos guy. He’s a massive buzzkill.

TABALUGA	Arktos killed my parents. (looks up) And all the other dragons.

LILLI	(affirming) My people had no idea. We love dragons. We trusted Arktos. (lowers her gaze) But he lied to us. He lied to me...

KOLK	He didn’t follow you here, did he?

LILLI	Only to the border. Arktos can’t cross it. So Green Land has nothing to fear from him.

KOLK	For now.

ARKTOS	Lilli was the perfect dragon trap... Elegant.	Cold. (to Mirmel) So what did I miss?

MIRMEL	(inhales to answer) Err--

ARKTOS	(cuts him off) I failed to make her immune... (in disgust) ...to love! And now she’s RUN OFF with this wretched, little... (screaming at Mirmel) ...DRAGON! (rumbling) That cursed creature must be destroyed! (to Mirmel) But how? I simply cannot go back to... (with a shiver of disgust) ... that hideously green Green Land.

MIRMEL	Mir mir

ARKTOS	(listens) We should tell the Icelanders	the dragon kidnapped Lilli?

MIRMEL	Mir mir...

ARKTOS	So, the Icelanders will go to war and attack Greenland?! Nonsense!

MIRMEL	(grunts)

ARKTOS	Hmmm... i have to find a way that the Icelanders go to war and attack Greenland.

MIRMEL	(irritated) Mir?

ARKTOS	I got it! I will tell the Icelanders that the dragon kidnapped Lilli. Why don’t you ever have ideas like that?

MIRMEL	(puzzled) Mir?

ARKTOS	(calls out) Mirmel! Gather the Icelanders for tomorrow morning, I have an important announcement to make!

MIRMEL	(sighs)

TABALUGA	Are you thinking of home?

LILLI	Mm-hmm. Do you think Limbo’s okay?

TABALUGA	I’m sure he is. He made it out of Polaris. He’ll be fine. It’s pretty strange, isn’t it. A girl from Iceland and a dragon from Greenland going for a walk, together. Folks Would flip!

LILLI	Yeah, they would. I’m flipping, but, you know, in a good way.
 
TABALUGA	I went to Ice Land to find my fire. But what did I find? (smiles) You.

LILLI	I’ve been looking for a dragon my whole life.	I thought it was my job. I never knew it was my destiny.

TABALUGA	(singing) I'm feeling you, yes it's true this time Forever you, beyond all space and time

LILLI	I'm feeling you, you are my lover A love so new, something words cannot describe I hear you too We need no words to understand you'll see You and me Cause when you're here….

TABALUGA/LILLI	(singing) … my heart lifts in song And there's fire in my blood I will love you forever, Cause I'm feeling you

ARKTOS	My dear Ice Landers! This is a dark day. A dragon whom we welcomed among us with complete trust, has cruelly abducted our precious flower, our Lilli!

LIMBO	Huh?! But...

ICE LANDERS	(murmuring)

ARKTOS	I am at a loss since that	flying snake made off with our beautiful, innocent Lilli. What ever should we do?

ICE LANDERS	We should rescue Lilli! / Yeah! Rescue Lilli! / Save Lilli!

ARKTOS	You mean stand up for ourselves?

ICE LANDERS	YESSSSSS!

ARKTOS	Attack Green Land!?

ICE LANDERS	YESSSSSS! Fight?! YESSSSSS!
 
ARKTOS	And kill the last dragon?!?!!

ICE LANDERS	YE--(stop, puzzled) Huh? (confused murmur)

ARKTOS	Ah! (loudly, to his people) In order to bring our Lilli home!

ICE LANDERS	YESSSSSS!

ARKTOS	What did I say about whispering? The side of my head is going to smell like fish for a week. Open the gate!

MIRMEL	Mir mir!

EMRA	Another Ice Lander? Are you sure?

LITTLE RABBIT	(nodding) He was all white and reeeeally big. Like a cloud with claws and fangs!

LILLI	(delighted) Limbo!

BULLY	(calmly to the others) Don’t panic, he’s not going to hurt you. He’s as friendly as he is big!

LILLI	(to Limbo) I’m so glad you’re safe!

LIMBO	(panting) I’ve got news! The extra-bad kind!

LILLI	What’s wrong?

LIMBO	Arktos told everyone you stole Lilli away... like, kidnapped her! He’s sending his army to attack Green Land, and to... well, to kill you!

SEVERAL GREEN LANDERS	Attack us? / That’s not okay! / But we haven’t done anything to the Ice Landers! / Typical!/ Oh no! What should we do!

EMRA	Well, that’s just jolly! Now we’re all in danger because of you!

LILLI	(decisively) I’ve got to go back to Ice Land to tell everyone the truth! Arktos can’t get away with this!

TABALUGA	Then I’m going too!

LILLI	No! You can’t go back there! Arktos wants to kill you!

TABALUGA	I don’t care. If you’re going, so am I.

LILLI	I’ll be fine. I may not be able to trust the army, but the Ice Landers are good people. If I tell them the truth they’ll rise up against Arktos.

TABALUGA	I’m going with you.
 
LIMBO	But how are we going to stop Arktos? He’s just so powerful.

KOLK	There is one chance. You must go to Nessaja.

LILLI	Nessaja?

KOLK	(to Lilli) Yes. She lives in the swamps. She knows things no one else does.

TABALUGA	To Nessaja, why?

KOLK	(to Tabaluga) Tabaluga, only your fire can stop Arktos.

TABALUGA	What?

EMRA	We’re dead.

KOLK	And only Nessaja can help you find your fire. You have no time to lose.

TABALUGA	Why are you only telling me this now?

KOLK	Because you can only go to her once in your life, and you needed to be ready... to learn what you are.

TABALUGA	Huh? (mentally wrestling) I... I... (determined) OK! (to Lilli) Let’s go, Lilli.

LILLI	Good luck, Tabaluga.

TABALUGA	What? You’re not coming with me?

EMRA	Some hero! He’s scared to go to the swamp by himself.

TABALUGA	I’m not scared to go by myself. It’s just I thought... Lilli...

LILLI	(cold) Why are you looking at me? Want me to hold your hand? Can’t do this on your own? It is starting to look like you are scared.

EMRA	(to Lilli) I’ve known dragon flies with more guts.

LILLI	Ha ha...! (the laughter immediately dies in her throat)

BULLY	I’m coming with you!

TABALUGA	I’m going to the swamps! BY MYSELF!

BULLY	Uh, okay. Whatever you say...

LIMBO	(to Lilli) That was so mean!

LILLI	Limbo, listen to me. That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but I only did it to protect Tabaluga. I had to let him go alone. He was never going to let me go back to Ice Land without him... (song) From this day on I put my heart on hold. I'll walk away as if it's nothing. And if you think that I am cruel and cold. This is the price, the price I pay for loving (song) And if it seems that I'm the one to blame. To kill our dreams and freeze the fire. The tide has turned and nothing is the same. But in my heart I always will remember. And I would do it all again Cause it was love that we were drinking. Of every minute every day, cause we were never planning, never thinking That this romance would ever end Because our love was freely given To all you are and to all I am And I would do it all again

LIMBO	(clears nose) Well, what are we waiting for?!

TABALUGA	Nessaja! Nessaja! Come on! This is really important! Is there some ancient word I’m supposed to say? Nessaja! Please!? This is ridiculous! My whole life is ridiculous! This stupid rock is ridiculous! Ahhh!

NESSAJA	You must be the young dragon Tabaluga.

TABALUGA	Yes, um, well... yes.
 
NESSAJA	Have a seat. So, you’re searching for your fire.... What have you done about it so far?

TABALUGA	I’ve been practicing every day, and I even went to Ice Land to try and find it.

NESSAJA	When you’re thirsty, do you go to the desert?

TABALUGA	What? No, I...

NESSAJA	When you need fresh daisies, do you look in a cave at the bottom of the lake?

TABALUGA	Uhm... Why would I need daisies? Look, Nessaja.	I need my fire. It’s very important. My friends could die. How do I find it? I’ve looked everywhere!

NESSAJA	(points to a spot nearby) Have you ever looked over there? Because I live here and I’ve never seen you look over there. Alright alright, I will tell you where your fire is.	You were right:  Your fire was in Ice Land. It was also in your home. It’s in this swamp. It is wherever you go in your life. Because... The fire is inside you. (Alternative:) It was also in your home. It’s in this swamp. It is wherever you go in your life. Because the fire is... (point at his heart) ...here.

TABALUGA	Seriously? It isn’t. I would know. Uhm... hello? Uhm, okay, you’re just going to go back inside there, huh... well, thanks for the advice, which was really vague and obvious all at the same time and kind of pointless, too.	So, bye, I guess. Bye...

MIRMEL	Mir-mir-mir!

LILLI	Oh no, they’re expanding Ice Land into Green Land. (MORE) Pretty soon Arktos will be able to pass over the border!

LIMBO	Oh, What are we gonna do?

LILLI	We have to get past them somehow. The army is loyal to Arktos, so we have to get through them to the real Ice Landers!

MIRMEL	Mir mir? MIR MIR MIR MIR!!!

LILLI	You hideous beast! Snatching me up just like that! I am a citizen of Ice Land! You can’t just arrest me! I’ve done nothing wrong!

LIMBO	(to Mirmel) Oh... er... yeah,...(MORE) I capprehended- er, traptured- er, caught this... um... Lilli here.

MIRMEL	Mir mir.

KOLK	Tabaluga! What did Nessaja say?

TABALUGA	(points at his mouth) You see any fire? Then who cares what she said? The Ice Land army is coming and I can’t stop them!

KOLK	But, Nessaja. What did she say?

TABALUGA	Some junk about daisies and how my fire is everywhere I go and blah blah blah.

BULLY	Lilli...

TABALUGA	(pretending not to care) Who?
 
BULLY	You know who! Lilli! She’s gone back to Ice Land...

TABALUGA	(aghast) What?! But she said... that can’t be... but then I... oh no. I’m such an idiot! She was only trying to protect me and save Green Land! I did this. I did all of this. I just had to find my stupid fire!

BULLY	Tabaluga, listen-

TABALUGA	And now all of you are in danger, Lilli’s gone and it’s all my fault!

BULLY	(loudly) Hello!! Ladybug to Pity Planet!!! They captured her! They’ve taken Lilli to Arktos!

TABALUGA	What?

KOLK	Wait!

TABALUGA	You can’t change my mind. I’m going to rescue Lilli.

KOLK	But I’m...
 
TABALUGA	I have to. With or without my fire.

KOLK	I’m so proud of you. Listen: Nessaja might be a little bit strange at times. But she is never wrong. Now, go save your friend.

TABALUGA	Thank you. For everything.

KOLK	(sniffing) Alright, off you fly! Fly to your fire! My son... There's sun in your heart and ice in your soul Passion so strong, it takes total control And then there is love with all of its feeling Opens the heart and sends you reeling Between two worlds Is a place that I secretly fly In another dimension Cause we have already discovered the sky Between two worlds There's a place that is peaceful and light We will keep trying we will keep hoping Till two worlds unite (singing) We're constantly seeking a better life When all that we need is already inside Addicted to pleasure, afraid of the pain Nothing to lose nothing to gain

MIRMEL	(giving orders) Mir-mir-mir!

ARKTOS	Please, have a seat!

LILLI	How could you do this to me? I trusted you!

ARKTOS	Muahahaaa!

MIRMEL	(attempt at evil laugh) Mir-Mir-Mir-Mir-Mir-Mir...

ARKTOS	And I made you. You played your part to perfection, my dear. The perfect bait for our little friend. Coming to your rescue will be the last thing he ever does. Muhahahaha!

LILLI	You monster!

ARKTOS	Who, me? I’m a cute cuddly snowman! Muhahah. You’re the one who’s expecting a giant flying lizard to save you. Now... Save your voice, dear. Can’t have you scaring off our intended victim. Muhahahahaaaaa!

TABALUGA	The gate is open and no guards. Strange.

BULLY	Not when you’ve got a lucky-bug with you!	I got so much luck coming off me, I can smell it. Go ahead. Smell the luck. Smell it.

TABALUGA	Uh, maybe later. Which way?

BULLY	Up... I think...

LILLI	(far away, muffled) Hmmmpf! Hmmmmmpf!
 
TABALUGA	(pricks up his ears) I can hear her! (runs) Oh, Lilli, please be ok!

LILLI	(muffled) Hmmmpf! Hmmmmmpf!

TABALUGA	Lilli!

LILLI	(muffled) Hmmmpf! Hmmmmmpf!

TABALUGA	(straining) Hang on, I can’t understand you.

LILLI	It’s a trap! We have to get out of here! Hurry!!

TABALUGA	Nooo!

BULLY	Oh, not good. Not good!

ARKTOS	Welcome back, little dragon!	Glad to have you as my guest, again! (laughing nastily) I think it’s time to put the last dragon to rest! Permanently! Muhahahaha!

TABALUGA	(angry / despair) I can do this! I can do this!

ARKTOS	Still no fire? Oh, what a shame--

BULLY	Limbo!

LIMBO	Oh boy. Ahhhhhhhh!

TABALUGA/LILLI	Aaah!
 
ARKTOS	Ahhh!

LILLI	Limbo!

LIMBO	(still puzzled) Hideous beast to the rescue!

ARKTOS	You... you again! Out of my way! Leaving so soon? Please, stay just a little longer and have some iced tea... or just some ICE! Muhahahaha!

TABALUGA	Ahhh!

LILLI	Tabaluga! Wake up. Wake up!

ARKTOS	Muhahahaha!

BULLY	Freeze, you nasty snowman.

ARKTOS	You first, Green Lander.

LIMBO	Bully! Ow! Hang on, Bully... ow, ow, ow! Don’t worry. I’ll thaw you out.

ARKTOS	And now, to you. 

LILLI	No, Arktos! Don’t!

TABALUGA	Lilli! (to Arktos) You can have me. Eliminate me. Destroy me! Just let Lilli live.

ARKTOS	Young love. How sweet. The only thing that could be sweeter is one of you watching the other perish. Muhahaha. Who will it be? (counts between them) Eenie-meenie-minie ...and ends on Lilli...moe. Say goodbye to Lilli!

TABALUGA	Noooooooooo!

ARKTOS	Ahhh!

BULLY	Yay!!! You show him! (to Limbo) Taught him everything he knows. Wait, was I just in your armpit?

ARKTOS	So, you finally found your fire. But it’s too late, little dragon.

TABALUGA	Limbo, Bully, go save Lilly! Lilly!

BULLY	Come on! Come on!

TABALUGA	Ahhh!

BULLY	Watch out!!!

TABALUGA	Lilly! Lilli!? Lilliiii! Lilli, where are you? Oh no, please no!

ARKTOS	No dragon has ever defeated me. And you will be no exception.

TABALUGA	What have you done to Lilli, Arktos?!	

ARKTOS	Lilli is where she belongs. And once you are destroyed, there’s nothing standing in my way. I will rule the world!

TABALUGA	AAAHH! AAARRGH!

BULLY	Come on! Get up!

TABALUGA	Take cover, Bully! Go!

BULLY	No! Come on! You can do it!

TABALUGA	(shocked)  Oh no.

ARKTOS	Lilli’s gone ...your fire is gone. (realization) Just like your father when he lost your mother. (sarcastic) Muhahahaha! Interesting that a dragons greatest weakness is his heart. Ahhhh!

LILLI	It’s his biggest strength, too! Ahhh....
 
TABALUGA	(sees Lilli) Lilli!!!

ARKTOS	Ahhh! My Eeeeeyes!! Noooo! Oh, what?!

TABALUGA	Arktos! Give up!

ARKTOS	NEVER!!! ARRRGHH!!!! AAAARRRRRGGGGHHH!!!!

LITTLE-ARKTOS	What, what happened!?
 
BULLY	Shrink him to bug size, Tabaluga!

LITTLE-ARKTOS	My beautiful hat!

LILLI	Here’s your hat, little man!

LITTLE-ARKTOS	(muffled) Hey! Ah! Help! Help me, my beautiful people! Kill the dragon!

PEOPLE	Liar! / Tyrant! / Murderer!

LITTLE-ARKTOS	What are you talking about? That dragon attacked me! He took Lilli prisoner. He... uh... he... uh...

POLAR BEAR	(angry) You think you can tell us anything you want, huh?!

LITTLE-ARKTOS	I am your ruler! I command you to...(looks down the escarpement) Oh! (a beat, realizes) Oh forget it! (stops, consumed by hate) I will freeze you all! Just watch me!	I’m bringing the storm!!
 
PEOPLE	(LAUGHING REACTS)

LITTLE-ARKTOS	Fine. If that’s how you want it. I... anyway... I will return!!!

MIRMEL	(laughs) Mir mir!

LITTLE-ARKTOS	(getting louder) Ow! Ah! Ahhhhh....

PEOPLE	Get lost, you liar! / Scram! / Take a hike!
 
ARKTOS	(turns around, scoffs) Icelanders! Ungrateful wretches! (sees Mirmel, gets mad) You! This is all your fault! That’s what you get for working with penguins! I had it all worked out. All you had to do was stick to the plan. But oh no! Who put you in charge anyway? Ahhh!

MIRMEL	(relieved sigh)

LILLI	Dragon magic!

TABALUGA	No, OUR magic!

LIMBO	And now we invite all the Greenlanders to Iceland!

BULLY	And all the Icelanders to Greenland!

TABALUGA	Wow, just look at that! Isn’t it amazing how everybody has become friends?!

LILLI	Right! And up until yesterday Bully thought that all Icelanders had... (mocks laughing) ...footlong fangs and knives for fingers!

TABALUGA	(sighs) At last, they’re all coming together.

LILLI/ TABALUGA	Like us.

SONG	Long live our friendship, this life we are living From moment to moment, day after day

BULLY	(to the ice-ladybug girl) ...then I said, “Make my day, Arktos.” I pretty much won the battle all by myself.

ICE-LADYBUG GIRL	(infatuated sigh)

BULLY/LIMBO/ICE LADYBUG	Hahaha!

SONG	Long live our friendship, this life we are living From moment to moment, day after day

KOLK	(moved, sniffing) Sorry... (sniffs) I’m a sucker for happy endings.

NESSAJA	(sniffing)  Me too.

KOLK / NESSAJA	(laugh)




(THE END)
