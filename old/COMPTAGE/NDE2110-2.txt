AURORA (V.O)	Join Me

MASON	Let’s see a prosthetic do that

DEZZIE	I got to get to work

MASON	That was work

DEZZIE		Maybe you need a prosthetic after all, might help with your stamina
MASON		Hey I promised you seven minutes of blissful ecstasy-
DEZZIE		And this time, you were only five short. Look at you making progress

DEZZIE	You know those things will kill you right?

MASON	That’s what my father used to say

MASON	Last pack then I quit for good…promise

MASON	See me later?

FEN	I’ll let you know

MASON	Uncle Fen

FEN	What the hell is this?

FEN	The Commander wants to see you now

MASON	Can I shower first?

FEN	No

FEN	Try to remember that it’s my ass on the line. Keep your 
	answers short, keep them honest, but mostly short.

MASON	I will. Thank you. For the opportunity

FEN	Don’t thank me yet

FEN	By the way, we got a new science officer. Try not to stare

MASON	What happened to Corrigan?

FEN	Shot himself

FEN	Captain Fen, Major Mason to see the Commander

COMMANDER		At ease gentlemen.

COMMANDER		This is our new science officer, Aurora Owon. We’ll make this brief. Our scanners have picked up an uncharted planet and have navigated us within deployment range. What does that mean Major?
MASON		It means that you need a leader for the expedition to determine if the planet is habitable. I would like to volunteer sir

AURORA	We understand you’ve never lead an expedition

MASON		No. No sir. But on account of my father, I’ve been scouting my entire life

COMMANDER		There are few left in the corps like him, damn shame, I’m sorry for your loss

MASON	Thank you sir

COMMANDER		You are not my first choice Major, but the rest of my lead expedition scouts are deployed. You say he’s ready Fen?

FEN	He’s ready

AURORA		Officer Corrigan’s voyager reports noted an incident of violence between you and an android medical assistant

MASON	Sir, we all get frustrated with technology from time to time

FEN		Obviously Officer Corrigan was never really the most stable human being. Major Mason has never once demonstrated any unnecessary aggression toward anything with an actual heartbeat

COMMANDER	You understand what it means to lead

MASON		When all else fails, complete the mission I understand the protocol sir

COMMANDER		Keep him in line Fen. Aurora will issue a preliminary briefing package. EOC in four hours. I’ll assemble the rest of your team. Dismissed

MASON/FEN	Thank you Sir

DEZZIE	To brave souls and new worlds

DEZZIE	Congratulations John

MASON	She’s going to miss me

FEN	Never underestimate the unknown kid, especially women

FEN	You might want to say goodbye to her

MASON	Eh, she’s busy

FEN	You’re telling me. You might not get another chance

MASON	Hey Dez, headed out. Want to come back to my cabin. I think I owe you five minutes

DEZZIE	I can’t, but I’ll miss you. Maybe we can catch back up at port

MASON	But what if I don’t come back to port?

ANDROID	*robot language*

MASON	Yeah I don’t think I was talking to you. Come on Dez

DEZZIE (O.C.)	Hey guys

MASON	No don’t worry about it, sometimes these old-

DEZZIE	Stop!

ANDROID	*robot language*

MASON	What? It’s not human. It’s broken not dead

FEN	I thought I told you to say goodbye, not get your assed kicked

MASON	Yeah well your advice was vague, as usual. 

FEN	Here

MASON	Thanks

FEN (O.C.)	Did your father ever tell you what happened on the Pioneer scout?

MASON	I know it was abandoned
FEN (O.C.)	That’s what the history courses teach everybody

FEN	We got a distress signal. Your father and I naturally volunteered to go down and investigate. You know, find out what happened, bury the bodies, you know the drill. The expedition leader, he picked up a climbing axe and he ripped open the stomachs of his pilot and science officer. Nobody knows why. Totally took us by surprise. Damn near killed me. Saved my life. 

MASON	Why are you giving me this?

FEN		Because you’re in charge now. Trust only your instincts, and this. And you’ll be ready for anything. From anybody. Of course, my advice is always vague. I have to go clean up your mess.

MASON		Expedition Vanguard, like most expeditions, three main objectives. Number One: determine suitability for colonization. Two: determine resources for economic exploitation. Three: We complete the mission and this mission is not over until we’re all safely back on this ship headed home

COMMANDER		Vanguard will be comprised of the standard six-man scout team. Captain. I recommend a strong cup of coffee before take off. Once on the ground, Major will take command for the remainder of the stay

RONDEAU	How long are we on the ground?

AURORA	About four thousand hours before Nova returns to port

COMMANDER		These rangers are at your command. If you should encounter anything problematic, it won’t be a problem for long. And with that, I’ll hand it over to your science officer.

AURORA		Thank you commander. The planet is an E-Class system. The molten core makes for ideal gravity and atmosphere. An asteroid ring, several moons, one which orbits in retrograde, another with a hard metal surface, chases and reflects the solar rotation. The planet is mostly cold desert, so we’ll be wearing base layer insulation suits.

SATO	Even if we’re upgraded?

AURORA		Yes, utilizing the benefits of an individual’s prosthetics is optional, but corps guidelines enforces a modicum of standardization to accommodate those without upgrades. Polar ice caps, snow at high elevations, will be landing in what seems like a very fertile valley. Initial scans indicate broad vegetation and organic life.

BOKA	Hostile?

COMMANDER		You’ll find out. Alright, your shuttle is in the deployment bay. Complete the mission. Dismissed.

VANGUARD (V.O.)	All Expedition personnel, report to Hanger B for further
	instruction

VANGUARD (V.O)	Captive hatches, initiated

SATO	Yeah, I’m not wearing this thing. I’ll sweat my ass off

MASON		You don’t have to wear it now. But on planet, we all follow regulations

BOKA		You really should consider upgrading. You know my rifle has a lot more stopping power than that little thing.

MASON	I like my revolver. It’s simple

BOKA		But it only has five bullets, you see my baby here? Can carry 200 rounds. Because size matters. She knows

AURORA	I know what?

BOKA	I’m around if you need anything

MASON	Good to know, thanks

SATO	Come on Boka, leave the lovebirds alone

AURORA	May I assist you with anything?

MASON	No

MASON	No

MASON	Captain

MASON	Alright, let’s warm her up

FEN	I’m already warmed up

MASON	Coffee right?

MASON	Ah, we’re all going to die

FEN	Ok, buckle them down John

MASON	Buckle them down… sir

FEN	We’re not on the ground yet

MASON	Vanguard crew, please take your seats and ready for departure

AURORA	We’re ready Captain

FEN	Alright, prepare for separation. Give me an EC pressure reading

MASON	Stable. Seven thousand PSI

FEN		Ah, shout out if it changes. Deactivate the exterior bay captive hatches and the locking systems

MASON	Uh Captain, pressure seals?

FEN	Thank you

FEN (O.C.)	Now deactivate

MASON	And we are…clear

FEN	Here’s where the fun begins

FEN	Go ahead take her down

MASON	Yes sir

FEN	Nova this is Vanguard. Comm check. How do you copy, over?

VANGUARD  (V.O.)	Read you loud and clear Vanguard. All looks good on our end. Over

MASON	Approaching interspace

MASON	Turbulence

RONDEAU	What the hell did we just hit?

MASON	Upper atmosphere, hold on. We’re going down fast. Fifteen thousand, fourteen, thirteen, eleven, ten, eight, six, five

FEN	Small corrections, small corrections! Ease up on your power

MASON	Three… what the hell was that?

FEN	You flooded it, stand by your anchors

FEN	Nova this is Vanguard, we’re going down hard

VANGUARD  (V.O.)	Captain, you’ve switched off your guidance-

FEN	Anchors! ... Anchors!

FEN		Damnit! We lost ventral thrusters and the inertial dampeners. Hold on back there, it’s going to get rough

FEN (O.C.)	Give me manual override

MASON	Are you sure?

FEN	I want full control right now

MASON	It’s yours

FEN		Alright, we’re going to get down as close as we can. Then we’re going to bellyflop. I’m just being honest

FEN (O.C.)		Okay I want my landing gear and a full reverse firing in three, two, one-

MASON	That was different

FEN	Wanna go again?

FEN		Nova this is Vanguard, we have a perfect touchdown, how do you copy, over?

MASON	Everyone alright back there?

RONDEAU	Eat too much sweetheart?

MASON	Not a big fan of flying?

SATO	What gave you that idea?

BOKA	Amateur

AURORA	Is that wind? It sounds-

MASON	Stranger

FEN	Well, you’ll either get used to it, or you won’t. Hey there she goes

MASON	Alright Captain Fen, You’re going to need to talk to the generator, make sure the Tracker survived that landing. Officer Owon, I need you to prepare the perimeter cameras, get your lab online.

RONDEAU	Area secured 

MASON	I’m going to take the Rangers for a walk

SATO (O.C.)	There are roads everywhere

BOKA	Yeah no shit

RONDEAU	Why are there roads here?

MASON	I don’t know, maybe a previous -woah!

BOKA	It’s a dead plant

MASON	Actually it’s in some sort of hibernation.

MASON	Carbon reads nearly three million hours

BOKA	So?

MASON	So that’s three times longer than you’re ever going to live

BOKA	Oh because you know so much about me?

RONDEAU	Can the attitude Boka 

BOKA	What?

SATO	Is there a reason for this little science lesson?

MASON		well it means it’s waiting for water, out of respect try not to…

RONDEAU	What the hell is that?

MASON	Woah, do not activate your weapons unless I give you a direct		order
MASON	That clear?

RONDEAU	Major, I suggest we keep moving. Boka, you lead the way

BOKA	Yes sir

BOKA	Just making sure it works

FEN			I can’t believe they made thirty-two of these

AURORA		Lab is online, habitat is running peak efficiency, that landing required me to patch-

FEN		Well listen, if we had relied on your automated guidance, neither one of us would be here right now.

AURORA		yes sir, I didn’t mean to imply that the dampener failure was your fault. My apologizes

FEN	Listen, the machines fail. All the time. These tires need rotating

AURORA	I can help

FEN		Relax doll, it’s a man’s job. If I can remember where they put the jack

AURORA	Be careful, machines fail all the time

FEN	Nova, all systems are reading nominal, over

VANGUARD  (V.O.)	Copy that Vanguard, we’ll be in service range for the next thirty minutes

SATO	Power’s on. We got water

RONDEAU	I could definitely use a drink

BOKA	Tell me about it

RONDEAU	Boka, I need to talk to you 

FEN	Copy that, we’re good to go. God speed Nova. Vanguard out. 

RONDEAU	You need to give him a break 

FEN (O.C.)	Four thousand hours, starts now

FEN	See anything interesting?

MASON (O.C.)	Saw some ancient ruins, bunch of rocks

FEN	You’ll get used to it-

MASON	Yeah or you won’t. I get it. 

MASON	Need something

BOKA	Yeah Major look, uh, I want to apologize for earlier. I was clearly out of line and it won’t happen again sir.

MASON	Alright.

MASON	That what you mean about uh, underestimating the unknown?

MASON	Four thousand hours

MASON	Alright, I’ll be right back

FEN	I’ll keep an eye out

MASON (V.O.)	We on schedule Aurora?

AURORA	Confirmed sir, you’re making good time

MASON	Alright

MASON (V.O.)	I’m at Site 5

AURORA	Confirmed sir, you’re making good time

RONDEAU (V.O.)	There, now you can shave with that

SATO (V.O.)	Sharp

RONDEAU (V.O.)	What did I just tell you?

BOKA (V.O.)	Dumbass

MASON (V.O.)	Register my visuals?

SATO (V.O.)	Sharp

AURORA	Good visuals sir

SATO (V.O.)	I don’t need a bandaid

AURORA	We are Five by Five

MASON (V.O.)	Alright, headed back

BOKA	I’m still hitting low. I don’t know if it’s my optics or my rifle

RONDEAU	It’s your optics. Have Aurora check you out

BOKA (V.O.)	With pleasure

MASON	Alright, that’s taken care of. Should I, uh, get out the Stryker, see if it works? Captain?

FEN	There’s something wrong with this planet

MASON	What do you mean?

FEN	Would you want to live here?

MASON	well we have to adapt to the planet.

FEN	Or, it adapts to us

FEN				By the way, you know she’s synthetic right?
AURORA	You need to keep your processor cleaner

BOKA	Hey what do you want me to say huh? I’m a dirty guy
AURORA	It’s your vitreous behind your lens. You have too much fluid and blockages are developing
BOKA	So you want to help with that huh? You want to help me relieve some of that fluid blockage?
SATO	I’d watch
RONDEAU	Me too
AURORA	Tempting

AURORA	This may sting

BOKA	Woah, woah, woah, wait, wait, wait!

BOKA (O.C.)	Shit

BOKA	That’s not funny guys. That’s not funny at all

AURORA	What?

SATO	So they’re way out there and they encounter this asteroid field, one of them goes up to the ship’s mechanic and says if the ship’s oxygen tank gets ruptured by one of those rocks? How long until we all suffocate? Ship’s mechanic says, for the rest of your life?
RONDEAU	Don’t ever say that joke again
SATO	You will hear it tomorrow
BOKA	Today is tomorrow guys, take a look
SATO	Oh what is that, tremors?
AURORA	I recorded several throughout the past few hours.
MASON	Should we be worried?
AURORA	Many small tremors could be a sign of gradual pressure release, which is of course better for us
AURORA	They’re birds

MASON	Uncle Fen, we’re going to go take a closer look at the ruins. Wanna come along?

FEN	Those rocks are moving.

MASON	What was that?

FEN	What? Oh no, no, I’m good here. I’ll wanna wait and see if those birds come back

SATO				Back home the uh, birds eat the worm sir

AURORA	Something triggered camera four. Would you like to see?

BOKA (O.C.)	What is it this time?

BOKA	Is it one of those huge things again?

RONDEAU	We’d probably hear the ground shaking

BOKA	I don’t see anything

AURORA	There it is

AURORA (O.C.)	Apply grid. Enhance Cell R8-C20

AURORA	Sharpen

BOKA	I still don’t see it

RONDEAU	The rock?

AURORA (O.C.)	Enhance two hundred percent

RONDEAU	Well, at least we know they work

MASON	How did we miss this creek before?

MASON	I dunno, maybe tremors opened up some underground source- hey! Hey! Don’t touch that

SATO	Don’t worry. Not going to cook you yet

MASON	Well, that should be enough for Aurora to run plenty of tests. Let’s get out of here.

SATO	Ah fu-

MASON (O.C.)	Hey Sato, you coming?

SATO	Yeah

SATO	Very strange

MASON	They were there

SATO	Yeah I saw it

MASON (V.O.)	We all did. I don’t know, maybe Captain Fen is right.

SATO (V.O.)	About what?

MASON (V.O)	He said the rocks move

SATO	Wait a minute. Seriously?

SATO	Tremors? Or something worse?

MASON	You mean one of those

MASON (V.O.)	Officer Owon, can you read me?

AURORA (V.O.)	Yes sir. We felt two tremors here. Are you alright?

MASON (V.O.)	We’re fine. We’re going to be headed back to the hab.

MASON	Sato!

SATO (V.O.)	Down here!

SATO	I’m fine

MASON	Hold on! 

SATO (V.O.)	Get me out of here!

MASON	Watch your head!

MASON (V.O.)	Grab on!

SATO (V.O.)	Got it

MASON (V.O.)	You’re going to be okay!

MASON	Shit

MASON	You’re going to be okay. Come on. Hold on to me! You can do this! Come on, come on! Get up

MASON (V.O.)	We’re going

AURORA	Major, we’re back online. What happened to Sato?

MASON	I don’t know

MASON	God damnit! Aurora!

BOKA	Rondeau, let’s go

RONDEAU	Right behind you

BOKA	It won’t open

RONDEAU	Let me try

RONDEAU	What the hell?

MASON	Open the door Aurora!

AURORA	We cannot let him inside, if he has a biological infection, we could all be compromised

RONDEAU	Aurora!

BOKA	Damnit!

RONDEAU	What the fuck’s going on?

AURORA	No that’s a direct violation of the Discovery Corps protocol

RONDEAU	Sato needs our help!

MASON	Open the God Damn door. That is an order.

AURORA	You’re not thinking clearly, we can not risk it

MASON	Open the God Damn door!

SATO (V.O.)	Aurora please

BOKA	Open it. Now

SATO	I’m fine. I’m fine. It’s just my head. It’s just my head hurts. It’s just, my head, there’s this ringing in my head

AURORA	Most prosthetics and organic systems seem to be functioning normally. I’ll have his blood analysis shortly. 

SATO	I’m fine

RONDEAU	Sato-

SATO	I’m fine!! I am fine! Get off me. I’m fine

MASON	Keep an eye on him

BOKA	Yeah no shit

SATO	It’s just my head. I’m fine. I’m fine

AURORA	You broke Mission Protocol. 

MASON	I saved a man’s life

AURORA	And put us all at risk. 

MASON	I made the right call. A human would understand

AURORA	You made a reckless call sir. 

MASON	We found a water source. I’ll bring you the samples

SATO	Don’t fucking drink that water

RONDEAU	By the time this is all over, you’re going to have to make tougher decisions than that sir. 

MASON	I didn’t endanger your men

MASON	There is something wrong with this place

RONDEAU	Aside from that giant worm, earthquakes and strange weather? What happened to Sato

MASON	I don’t know

RONDEAU	It’s your job to know

MASON	That’s why I have Aurora checking him

RONDEAU	We need a strong leader. Those men are my responsibility too. 

MASON	Do your job. I’ll do mine

MASON	Where’s Fen?

RONDEAU	Maybe just out for a walk?

MASON	Uncle Fen?

MASON	Uncle Fen?

AURORA	His blood looks fine

BOKA	That’s good

BOKA	You want me to make some chow Ranger?

SATO	You want to make me feel worse?

MASON (O.C.)	Uncle Fen?

MASON	Uncle Fen? He’s gone

RONDEAU	We don’t know that

MASON	Well he’s not here

AURORA	I have activity on Camera Three

MASON	I don’t see anything

AURORA	Looping clip

BOKA	There it is

AURORA	All other channels are clear. He’s within the perimeter

MASON	Alright, let’s go

AURORA	I should stay here sir

MASON	Yeah, probably should

SATO	I’m fine, really. No, I’m serious I’m feeling much better. Look I know I look pretty hammered, but I’m fine. I can watch a few monitors

MASON	Have you checked his blood?

AURORA	I’ve checked Sato with everything that I have. I can’t explain it but, he’s returned to homeostasis. I’ll do as you command sir. 

MASON	Stay here. Watch him. And those monitors

BOKA	Major, time to pop your cherry

SATO	I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m fine

BOKA (O.C.)	Captain Fen?

RONDEAU	There are a lot of tracks out here

MASON	Alright, let’s spread out

MASON (O.C.)	Uncle Fen?

BOKA	Fen?

RONDEAU	Captain Fen?

MASON	Uncle Fen!?

BOKA	Captain Fen?

RONDEAU	Captain Fen?

RONDEAU	Captain?

MASON (O.C.)	Uncle Fen?

RONDEAU	Boka, are you alright?

BOKA	Yeah I’m good. I just got a little spooked that’s all. 

RONDEAU	Captain?

MASON	Uncle Fen!? …. Shit

BOKA	So what do you think is wrong with Sato?

RONDEAU	I don’t know. I mean, he’s just not right. 

BOKA	He’s got to be on the other side of the perimeter

AURORA	That’s impossible, I’d catch something on the monitors

RONDEAU	Where ever he is, we are going to find him. Eat, rest, and	 when you’re recharged, we’ll go out and keep looking
MASON	Fine
BOKA	You want to tell me what’s wrong with that hand?
SATO	It’s in my head. It’s burning in my head. Get back, get back! Get back.

SATO	No one’s there. Get back. No, no, no, no. Back.
BOKA	Easy, easy

SATO	Get back! 

SATO	Get back! Back!

SATO	It’s in my head!

MASON	Sato, Sato

MASON	Ranger

BOKA	Listen to me

MASON	Ranger!

SATO	That feels much better. That’s much better. That feels a lot 
	better

AURORA	Let me help you

MASON	Ranger put down the knife that’s an order!

MASON	Someone get that God damn knife out of his hand!

AURORA	No one touch anything

BOKA (V.O.)	The hell happened out there?

MASON	I don’t know

RONDEAU	How could you not know?

MASON		We were at the stream taking samples, the quake hit and I lost Him

AURORA	Did he drink the water?
MASON	I don’t know
AURORA			I need to examine these
BOKA				Right now? We need to bury him
MASON	No

BOKA	No?

AURORA	We need to burn the body

RONDEAU	We bury our own!

AURORA	If what he had was infectious

MASON	I don’t want to take any chances. Do it.

RONDEAU	Sato was a Ranger, you have no right to tell us what to do

MASON		I’m in charge here. Burn the body, that’s an order
MASON	Aurora, I’m going to want a complete sweep of the cabin, make sure it’s clean. I’m going to go look for Fen
AURORA	We should go in teams. Alternating shifts.
MASON		Alright, Boka, you’re with me.
BOKA			This expedition is fucked
RONDEAU		I know. Boka? Watch your back
BOKA			Yeah that’s right. You better run
BOKA (V.O.)	Sir, we’ve been out here more hours than I can count. Maybe it’s time we head back.
MASON		Alright, give me two minutes, I’ll meet you back at the tracker
BOKA (V.O.)		Copy that. Actually, I’m already at the Tracker
MASON		How long you been there?
BOKA 			Awhile
MASON 		I’m going to take a last look, I’ll be down in one minute.
BOKA			Good enough for me.
MASON		UNCLE FEN!
BOKA			I needed this
BOKA			Major do you Copy?
MASON (V.O.)	Copy
BOKA			I think I got something sir
MASON		Is it Captain Fen?
BOKA			No. This is something else
MASON		Well damnit Boka, what is it?
BOKA			It’s camouflaged sir. I think it’s one of those creatures
MASON	Is it hostile?

BOKA	Not yet

MASON (V.O.)	Well leave it alone

BOKA	It seems to be feeding

MASON	On what?

BOKA	On one of them sir

BOKA (V.O.)	Now it’s staring straight at me

BOKA	That’s it, come on

MASON	Boka, don’t do anything stupid

BOKA	Make a move

MASON	Boka!

BOKA	Damnit

MASON	Boka!

MASON (V.O.)	What happened?

BOKA	I missed

MASON	Did it attack you?

BOKA	No

MASON (V.O.)	Then why did- 

MASON	-you shoot it? Boka I’m at the tracker

MASON (V.O.)	Boka are you reading me?

BOKA	Yes, I read you, I read you. I just don’t care

MASON (V.O.)	Well get back and let’s get the hell out of here

MASON (V.O.)	Boka!

MASON	Boka!

MASON	Boka! Boka! Boka!

MASON	Boka

MASON	I got you. It’s going to be okay. I got you. I got you

MASON	Aurora is going to fix you up. You’re going to be fine

MASON	I got you

MASON	Aurora is going to fix you up. She’s going to take care of you

RONDEAU	Well? What happened to Boka?

MASON	I told you, I don’t know. Something attacked him

RONDEAU	This is bullshit. I don’t understand how you could walk away, covered in Boka’s blood and not have a single scratch on you

AURORA		Calm down Rondeau. 

MASON		It was an accident

RONDEAU	What?

MASON	I shot him, I-

MASON	Put it down Rondeau

AURORA	Both of you put your guns down

RONDEAU	He just admitted to killing him

MASON	I did not kill Boka! Something attacked him. Now stand down!

RONDEAU	Not happening

AURORA	We need to investigate

MASON	Listen to her Rondeau. I can take you to him. 
RONDEAU	I can’t trust him. Not now. 
AURORA	I have a solution, just put your gun down
AURORA	I know how to get the truth. 
AURORA	It’s terrible. It wasn’t murder. Something attacked him first. If anything it was a merciful accident. 
RONDEAU	We need to extract his memory card so Discovery has recordation
AURORA	Major, may I borrow your knife?
RONDEAU	Now?
AURORA	It will be faster this way. 
AURORA	This may be unpleasant to watch. 
MASON	Lieutenant Boka, Discovery Corps thanks you for your service
MASON	Rondeau
MASON (O.C.)	Rondeau
MASON	Rondeau!
RONDEAU	I’m going to take a look at his footage for myself
MASON	I am doing the best that I can down here
AURORA	We have activity on Camera Three
RONDEAU	It’s probably just-
AURORA	It’s Captain Fen!
AURORA	About fifteen minutes ago
MASON	Rondeau you’re with me. 
AURORA	What if he needs medical attention-
MASON	Then Rondeau can handle it! Come on!
MASON (O.C.)	There’s the camera!
MASON	Uncle Fen!
RONDEAU	Captain?
MASON (O.C.)	Where are you?
MASON (O.C.)	Uncle Fen?
AURORA	Sir, I’m picking up a lot of interference
MASON (O.C.)	We just saw him!
RONDEAU	Captain Fen!
MASON	Uncle Fen!
MASON (O.C.)	Uncle Fen? God damnit
MASON	Uncle Fen!?
MASON	Uncle Fen
FEN	No, no, no, no, you have to kill me and run!
MASON	You need to calm down. You need to calm down
FEN	Go!
RONDEAU	My god
MASON	You got to listen to me-
FEN	Kill me! Now!
RONDEAU	Let’s pick him up, let’s take him back to the habitat
MASON	Good
FEN	No! No! They’re everywhere! No! You got to kill me and run! They are everywhere. Kill me, now, now do it!
FEN	Kill me now, please
MASON	No Rondeau. We are not doing that. 
RONDEAU	He wants to die. 
MASON	I need your help
RONDEAU	Lower your gun
MASON	You shoot him, you die. 
MASON	No!
AURORA	Mason are you alright? 
AURORA (O.C.)	Is Rondeau dead?
AURORA	Run Mason now
AURORA (O.C.)	Get out of there!
AURORA (O.C.)	Mason, do you copy? You’re breaking up can you hear me? Mason, what’s happening? Mason, can you hear me? What’s happening, are you in danger? Mason?
MASON	They’re out here
AURORA	Move now!
AURORA	Mason to your right!
AURORA	Mason, are you alright?
AURORA	Mason, run now!
AURORA	They’re right behind you
AURORA (O.C.)	To your right! Shoot it!
AURORA	Mason move now!
AURORA	It’s on your left!
MASON	Aurora?
MASON (O.C.)	I’m at the ship
AURORA	Get inside! 
AURORA	Hurry!
AURORA	We’re almost there sir!
AURORA	It’s good you’re doing very good. 
AURORA	Ok, this may sting
AURORA	Just keep breathing, slow deep breathes. We can manage this. You’re very lucky
MASON	They were my responsibility and now they are dead because of me
MASON	I never should’ve volunteered for this
MASON	I’ll never serve Expedition again. I don’t know anything else. Sorry, Dad
AURORA	Your father made some tough decisions
MASON	You know nothing about him 
AURORA	I accessed his file. I understand he was in an accident
MASON	Accident? A driverless vehicle swerved to avoid hitting a group of children. Only my father was killed, and I walked away with-
AURORA	With post traumatic stress. I’m sorry sir. 
MASON	Empathy? From a machine?
AURORA	What choice would you have made? It’s true, programming morality is complex. 
AURORA (V.O.)	Technology can be dangerous but that doesn’t mean it should be avoided or blamed. Boka, Rondeau, Sato, they died because of what’s out there. 
AURORA	But you’re still here. And you can still complete this mission. Trust me.
MASON	What are you?
AURORA	Adapting
MASON (V.O.)	Alright fourth marker. Here we go, I’m getting out. We all clear?

AURORA	We’re all clear. Looks good

MASON (V.O.)	You know, I’d feel a whole lot better if you were down here, packing that minigun

AURORA	This is a superior vantage point. I have my crosshairs right on your back sir

MASON	Not comforting to hear Aurora

AURORA (V.O.)	Two more, and then we can stay in the hab until Nova returns

MASON (V.O.)	Ready down here

AURORA	All clear. Fire away

MASON	Good readings coming in. There’s an ocean of water just below the surface. 

AURORA	Too bad it’s all poison

MASON	Gold, a giant vein. Well this planet might not be habitable-

MASON (V.O.)	But at least there are economic resources

AURORA	Sir, don’t move

AURORA (V.O.)	Do you see it?

MASON	I do now. Shoot it. 

AURORA (V.O.)	Just a moment

MASON (V.O.)	What are you waiting for Aurora?

AURORA	Hold on

MASON	Take the shot!

MASON (V.O.)	What are you doing?

AURORA (V.O.)	Trust me, don’t move

MASON	Shoot it!

AURORA	Got them. You’re clear

MASON	Sure about that?

AURORA (V.O.)	Yes. You trust me right?

MASON	Looks like I don’t have a choice

MASON	Well the tablet’s broken

AURORA (V.O.)	We can still deploy the last two transmitters. Unless you would rather head back to the habitat now sir

MASON	Well, since we’re already out here. Let’s just complete the mission

AURORA (V.O)	Yes sir. 

MASON (V.O.)	Thank you by the way

AURORA (V.O.)	Just doing my job sir. 

MASON	Also, I wanted to tell you-Ah!

AURORA	Close call

MASON	Alright, coming over

AURORA (V.O.)	Copy that sir

AURORA	Sir?

MASON	Aw shit

MASON	Aurora!

AURORA	We need to move

AURORA	Mason? I’m here. I’m going to turn you over okay? One, two, three, come on, nice and gentle. 

AURORA	Your right lung is collapsed. Okay, I’m going to get you back to the habitat. But first I have to cause you some more pain, so you can breathe. Do you trust me?

AURORA	Try and relax

AURORA	One, two, 

AURORA	Better?

MASON	Yeah

AURORA	Okay we need to get you back within ten minutes or we have to do that all over again. Ok? Let’s get you up.

MASON	No, you drive. I’ll cover your back this time

AURORA	Yes sir

AURORA	How you feeling back there?

MASON	Dangerous

MASON	Can’t this thing go any faster?

AURORA	Something’s broken!

MASON (V.O.)	We’re ditching!

AURORA	Ok!

MASON	How bad is it?

AURORA	Bad

AURORA	They’re blocking the doorway

AURORA	We might have to make a run for it

MASON	Aurora?

MASON	Complete the mission!

AURORA	Mason!

AURORA	Mason!

MASON	Aurora!

MASON	Get down!
