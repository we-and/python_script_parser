STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.
STORYTELLER	And one day...	

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!	

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends, Really Useful 	around the World!

STORYTELLER	Thomas visits Japan!	

STORYTELLER	Thomas was pulling some passenger coaches and enjoying the sights when he heard a train approaching.

STORYTELLER	“Hello!” Said Thomas. But the train didn’t stop.

STORYTELLER	“Wow!” said Thomas. “He was fast! Too fast to say ‘hello’.”

STORYTELLER	Later on, Thomas was picking up some passengers when he saw something he’d never seen before!

STORYTELLER	Before Thomas’s passengers boarded their coach, they took the time to say ‘hello’. Greeting Thomas with a deep bow and saying, “Konnichiwa!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas said ‘hello’ in his own way!	

STORYTELLER	Thomas was about to leave the station when he heard another train coming along.

STORYTELLER	And he didn’t say hello either.	

STORYTELLER	Down the line, Thomas saw something else he’d never seen before.

STORYTELLER	This time, Thomas knew how to greet his passengers the Japanese way! “Konnichiwa!” said Thomas.

STORYTELLER	“Konnichiwa!” said the passengers.	

STORYTELLER	Thomas was not far from his final destination when he saw the two fast trains waiting up ahead. “Konnichiwa!” said Thomas. “What’s the hold up?”

STORYTELLER	And then he saw the line was blocked. Thomas didn’t know what to do – but his passengers did!

STORYTELLER	Thomas’s passengers were Really Useful! The other trains were impressed. They thought Thomas should go ahead of them.

STORYTELLER	But the other trains soon caught up with Thomas! This time, they did say ‘hello’, “Konnichiwa! Konnichiwa!”

STORYTELLER	And Thomas said ‘hello’ back with a ‘peep peep’ of his whistle.
