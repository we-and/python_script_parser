STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends. Really Useful 4 around the World! 
STORYTELLER	Thomas visits Pompeii.	
STORYTELLER	Thomas was in Italy, collecting some tourist passengers. The platform was very busy.
STORYTELLER	“Fizzling fireboxes!” Said Thomas, “What a lot of passengers!” 

STORYTELLER	That’s because you’re going to Pompeii!” said a big, green engine.
STORYTELLER	“Pompeii is a very important place,” explained the big, green engine.

STORYTELLER	“It is an ancient city that was buried under rock and ash when a volcano – Mount Vesuvius – erupted nearly , years ago!”

STORYTELLER	“And now a huge number of people visit Pompeii, to see what life was like a long time ago. For them it’s like travelling back in time!”

STORYTELLER	“Cinders and ashes!” said Thomas. “I can’t wait to see Pompeii!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas was very excited. He didn’t slow down. Not until he reached...

STORYTELLER	...Pompeii!	
STORYTELLER	Thomas could hardly believe his eyes. “No cars, or trucks or steam engines... And people, wearing oldfashioned clothes!”
STORYTELLER	“Fizzling fireboxes!” Said Thomas. “I really have travelled back in time!”

STORYTELLER	“Cut! Cut! Cut!” yelled a Movie Director. “What is that big blue engine doing in the middle of my movie set?! They didn’t have tank engines back in old Pompeii!”

STORYTELLER	Some people were filming a movie in the middle of Pompeii – and Thomas had rolled right into it!

STORYTELLER	“Oops! Sorry!” Said Thomas. He felt ever so embarrassed! But his passengers didn’t seem to mind!
