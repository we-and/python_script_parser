DEE	No, mate, I’m good. 

JASON	Oh, man, that was mental. Oh, fuck. Seriously, though, dude, you need to make sure you do not get nicked. That could mess up Graff Jam, everything you’ve been working for. 

DEE	No, mate. It’s worth it. It’s worth it for the art. 

JASON	And for the buzz. Hey, hey. 

DOMINIC	Alright, let’s have a look.

NADINE	You alright?  

MARCUS	Here you go, mum. Picked up a few packs at the shop.

PHOTOGRAPHER	Smile. Smile. Kirsten, nice. Again. Smile. Stay. Fantastic. You look beautiful, Kirsten. You look glowing. Excellent. Smile. 

KIRSTEN	Hey! You didn’t tell me you were going to meet me here. 

DEE	You mentioned where the shoot was so I thought I’d surprise you. 

DEE	How was it then?

KIRSTEN	Um, it was good. It was just basic but I’ve been here since 8 in the morning so, just a little tired. 

DEE	oh, yeah. Alright, behave. I was out at 4 this morning with Jason. 

KIRSTEN	[LAUGH] 

DEE	Well, my dear, which way? Want to bus it or tube it?

KIRSTEN	No need. They sent a car for me. [LAUGHING] Come on. Look, he’s right there. 

DEE	So, guess what? You are probably going to meet my mum and my brother next week. 

KIRSTEN	You invited them? I’m so excited. Okay, tell me about them. 

DEE	Alright. Um, my mum’s quite chill. She sits around getting stoned most of the time. 

KIRSTEN	[LAUGH] Okay. 

DEE	And then my brother, he’s very different than I am. 

KIRSTEN	And?

DEE	Uh, alright. Um, my mum came over from Spain when she was 18. She met Marcus’ dad, who was actually over there visiting his mates, and then she ended up moving back to London with him. Well, me and Marcus, we’ve got different dads, you see. 

KIRSTEN	Oh, I didn’t know that. 

DEE	Yeah, yeah, Marcus’ dad was killed not long after Marcus was born. [PAUSE] He did a bank robbery, and the car he was in got ran off the road by the old mill. 

KIRSTEN	Oh, shit. Oh my god! What about your dad?

DEE	I don’t know much about him. 

NICKY	Come on, son! Go, son! Get in there!

MARCUS	Had a result there, Nick?

NICKY	Came in nice, yeah?

KWAME	Sweet. 

MARCUS	50 grand. But he said a couple of waches are a bit too rare.  Here, Nick, get your buddy to melt down. 

NICKY	Yeah, of course. You got a buyer for the stones? 

MARCUS	Yeah, of course. 

DOMINIC	Alright, I swear to god, it’s the last time I’m buying a round. Oh, wait, tell you what, no change? [LAUGHING] Stop being tight, man. Nice one. 

NICKY	Oh, flipping hell.

KWAME	Quick, hand me the drink. What’s happening is all a joke. 

KWAME	Have you seen this? 

MARCUS	What’s that?

NICKY	Oh yeah, I know him, years ago, in Feltham, bruv. 

KWAME	Yeah?

NICKY	We was on the same wing, man. He’s from Canning Town. He’s a good geezer. 

KWAME	Well, it says here, armed police ambushed a smash and grab gang last night. They battered through the windows of a jewelers in Northfield Shopping Center, East London. Scotland Yard said this was a pro-active operation by The Flying Squad, into an organized criminal network involving smash and grab robbers. The Flying Squad, nicknamed the Sweeney - [LAUGHTER] 
 
DOMINIC	Fuckin’ Sweeney. 

KWAME	…had been deployed to target smash and grab raiders after a serious of long-running attacks on luxury stores across London. 

NICKY	What else does it say?

KWAME	In custody. Magistrates is next week. 

TARA	That’s them Canning Town boys. I saw it on the news this morning. They got proper fucked by someone. 

DOMINIC	Hey, look, says the Old Bill had intelligence.  

NICKY	They’ve been grassed, mate. There ain’t no other way. 

MARCUS	Yeah, but on the other hand, maybe they just got a bit sloppy. Why do you think I’m always saying we’ve got to keep a low profile? 

DEE	Hello, mum, you in? 

NADINE	Yeah, I’m here. 

DEE	Hello. 

NADINE	Hi. 

DEE	You alright?

NADINE	Yeah. I’m bleeding starving again. Have you eaten, baby?

DEE	No, I’m alright. I ate earlier. [PAUSE] Listen, mum, I think I’m going to move out for a little bit, maybe for good. 

NADINE	Oh, that’s great, baby. Where are you moving into? What’s the plan?

DEE	Well, I’m going to move in with a girl I’m seeing. 

NADINE	Kirsten? 

DEE	Yeah. Yeah, she’s got a place over in the east end, and I thought it would be good for a while, you know. 

NADINE	Yeah, yeah. Come, tell me everything about her. I want to know everything. 

KWAME	The least, we need to find Dominic a bird. 

DOMINIC	Listen, I don’t need a girl, mate. Too much aggro. I’m happy being free and single. 

KWAME	That weren’t what you said the last one gave me the elbow. 

DOMINIC	Hey, I never got the elbow. I just don’t want to be attached.

KWAME	We said one drink, yeah? 

TARA	Are you working tonight?

EMMA	Yeah. 

KWAME	Three on here, mate. What are you talking about?

JUNIOR	I sweat it’s them pussy holes. 

TARA	Do they want to say something? 

DOMINIC	Fuckin’ West Grove boys. 

EMMA	Leon and that flash cunt Junior need to fuck right off. 

JUNIOR	[LAUGH] 

EMMA	They think they’re too heavy. 

KWAME	Proper idiots. 

DOMINIC	Fuckin’ pussies. I should put both of them in the fucking ground, straight. 

EMMA	And you know they got all the dealers in this manor now. It’s burned the whole area now, top to bottom, first few months every single shop around here has been buying from them. 

MARCUS	Alright?

DEE	Alright?

MARCUS	Fuckin’ hell, mate. That’s well good. 

DEE	Cheers. 

MARCUS	Here, got a few. 

DEE	Oh, nice one. 

MARCUS	So, how’s it all going, this art thing you’re doing?

DEE	Yeah, alright. 

MARCUS	I’m really proud of you, you know. I mean that. 

DEE	I know, bruv. [PAUSE] So, what have you got going on?

MARCUS	Same old, really. Just doing my thing with the boys. 

DEE	You know, you should slow down a bit.
 	
MARCUS	No, mate, never. I’ve got big plans. So, I see you’re full of smashing the system then, against this and that. 

DEE	Yeah, pretty much what you’re doing really, isn’t it? Confronting authority, changing society. 

MARCUS	Fuck the authorities but I don’t want society brought down. Otherwise, there’d be nothing left for me to go and blag. 

KIRSTEN	[GIGGLING] Surprise. 

DEE	What are you doing here? 

KIRSTEN	What do you think I’m doing here? [HUGGING DEE] Hi. 

SHAUN’S FRIEND	He’s a little bitch. 

SHAUN	Oh, shut up, man. Course, I don’t like that stuff fucking neat. 

SHAUN’S FRIEND	Right, S. 

SHAUN	What do you say, Dee? 

DEE	What’s going on, Shaun?

SHAUN	What’s that you’re wearing, is that aftershave? 

DEE	No, mate, deodorant. 

SHAUN	Fuckin’ hell, bruv, you’re caked in it. 

DEE	Oh, behave. Alright, later, yeah? 

KID	Yeah, later. 

DEE	Alright, boys. Hello, Kerry. 

KERRY	You alright?

DOMINIC	What’s happening, brother? Good, yeah? A long time, Dee. What’s going on? Never see you around here these days. 

DEE	Just working on my shit, you know?

DOMINIC	You’re all over east, I hear. It’s good to hear, man. 

NICKY	Your brother’s over there, man. 

DEE	Oh, alright. Sweet. Later, yeah?

KERRY	See ya. 

NICKY	Behave yourself, yeah? [CHUCKLES]

DOMINIC	[TO KERRY] He used to fancy you back in school. 

DEE	You alright? 

EMMA	You alright, Dee?

DEE	You alright, Emma.

TARA	What, you can’t say hi to me anymore? 

DEE	Sorry, Tara. You alright? 

TARA	You alright?

KWAME	What’s going on, all good, yeah?

EMMA	Oh, it’s fucking cold. I’ve got to get in. 

KWAME	See you. I’d love to stay with you lot longer but I can’t. Seriously. 

MARCUS	Where are you off to?

DEE	I’m going to see my girl. 

MARCUS	Here, put that in your pocket. 

DEE	No worries, bruv. I’m cool. 

MARCUS	Shut up! I can’t have you run about with no dough, can I? Just take it. 

DEE	I’m sorry. Seriously, I’ve got a few quid on me already. 

MARCUS	Shut up. You’re my brother. Especially if you’re taking out that bird of yours, alright? Enjoy your night. Have a good one. 

DEE	Alright, thanks. I appreciate it. 

MARCUS	I know you do. Talk later. 

WOMAN	KIRSTEN?

KIRSTEN	Hi. 

WOMAN	Can we get a photo of you?

KIRSTEN	Oh my gosh, of course, yeah. [PAUSE] You can with my boyfriend, Dee. [TO DEE] Come! Just one second. 

KIRSTEN	Thank you! 

KIRSTEN	That is him. 

KIRSTEN	I’ve gotta go. My car is downstairs. 

DEE	Okay, have a good one. 

KIRSTEN	Mm-hm. 

DEE	I’ve got to get up too. I’m working this morning. What time are you back?

KIRSTEN	Probably late. I’ll text you. 

DEE	I’ll fetch myself over this evening, alright? 

KIRSTEN	Great. [THEY KISS] Bye. 

DEE	Bye. 

MARCUS	What?

MARCUS	You’re so beautiful. You know that? 

EMMA	Yeah, I know. 

MARCUS	[CHUCKLE] 

EMMA	Got much happening this week? 

MARCUS	Yeah, I’ve got a few things I have to check out on Oxford Street, and I’ve still got to get them outfits. Anyway, I’m going to stay at my gaff for the rest of the week. Don’t really want to be seen in and out of here too much at the minute. 

EMMA	Yeah, of course. Shout me later if you want me to come over. 

MARCUS	Yeah, of course, I’ll do. [THEY KISS] Love ya. 


RADIO VO	For years, luxury stores faced an onslaught of attacks by robbers who used cars for ram raiding, for those who specialize in high-end targets have now found other ways – motorbikes. 

RADIO VO	10 am, Blue Cross Shopping Center, north London. This clip shows the moment a motorbike gang sped into the center and targeted the jewelers, H. Silverman. A security guard – 

RADIO VO	…is forced to move out of the way by a robber waving an ax, as three others smashed through the – 

RADIO VO	…shop’s windows and grabbed watches and jewelry worth up to £3000, before robbers, dressed in black jumpsuits, rode high-power motorcycles…

DEE	Alright. 

NADINE	You’ve got everything you need?

DEE	Yeah. Sweet, give me a call, will ya?

MARCUS	Yeah, of course. 

DEE	I’ll see you later all anyway at my Graff Jam. 

MARCUS	What, that graffiti thing?

DEE	Yeah, at the weekend. Sweet.

EMMA	See ya, later. 

MARCUS	Make sure we’re all get invited to the wedding, yeah?

NADINE	[SLAPS MARCUS] [SOMETHING IN SPANISH] Bye, baby! 

DEE	Bye-bye. 

NADINE	Call me. Bye! 

MARCUS	Bye. 

TV VO	…engines running and intimidating shoppers, the raid took less than 2 minutes.

TOUGH 1	Yo. Don’t ya hear me! 

WOMAN	Do I know you? Fuck that bullshit. 

TOUGH 1	Yeah, anyways… [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] 

DOMINIC	I know you from somewhere, don’t I?

ROCHELLE	Do ya?

DOMINIC	Yeah. That’s it. You’re with the West Grove boys, ain’t ya?

ROCHELLE	I know them but I ain’t with them. 

DOMINIC	Okay. What is your name?

ROCHELLE	Rochelle. 

DOMINIC	Ah, yeah, that’s the one. Rochelle, yeah. I thought so. 

ROCHELLE	Right. 

DOMINIC	So, what’s up with those West Grove fools?

ROCHELLE	They’re from my area, aren’t they? That’s all. Ain’t nothing to do with me. They’re grasses too. They talk to Triden, in’it.  One of my cousins is doing time right now because of them. 

DOMINIC	Yeah, well, a good police grass is a dead police grass. 

ROCHELLE	Exactly. They’re fucking fools. 

DOMINIC	You used to go out with that Leon too, right?

ROCHELLE	Yeah, a time ago. He’s just a boy in a man’s body. Trust me. [THEY LAUGH] 

ROCHELLE	Oh!

DOMINIC	What’s wrong?

ROCHELLE	I need to get back down soon. But we’ll smoke this first, yeah? 

DOMINIC	I’ll see you again, though, right?

ROCHELLE	Yeah, definitely. 

WAITER	Your Turkish coffee.

CUSTOMER	Cheers, buddy. 

WAITER	Ladies, what can I get for you? 

PA ANNOUNCER	Evacuate the building. Evacuate the building. This is not a drill. Evacuate the building. 

PA ANNOUNCER	Evacuate the building. Evacuate the building. Evacuate the building. 

WAITER FROM CAFÉ	Hey, NADINE fucker!

NICKY	Fuck sakes. 

WAITER	Hey! 

PEDESTRIAN	Keep the bastard down! Call the fuckin’ police! Shit! Call the fuckin’ police! 

NICKY	Get off me! 

KWAME	You want a fuckin’ ride? Get on! Come on. 

NICKY	Go off, go off! 

JASON	Dee!

JASON	Dee! 

DEE	What’s wrong with your phone? 

JASON	They’ve friggin’ cut me off again, haven’t they? Incoming calls only. 

DEE	[CHUCKLE] Alright, I’ll be down in one minute. 

DEE	Hey, listen, babe. I’m going to shoot out for a little while. I’ll probably be back in a couple of hours. Do you want me to pick you up later?

KIRSTEN	No, I’m good but I will call you after my dinner. 

DEE	Alright. Have a good time, yeah?

KIRSTEN	Night. [THEY KISS] Mm. [THEY KISS AGAIN] 

DEE	Where are you going? Come here. [THEY KISS AGAIN] Alright, bye. 

KIRSTEN	Bye. 

EMMA	Yeah, he’s here at mine. I’ll just get him. Yeah, I’m alright. Here he is. 

SHAUN	Who is it?

EMMA	It’s mum for you. 

NEWSREADER	Central London was rocked this evening when a daredevil gang attacked one of the capitol’s most prestigious department stores. Nigel Kirk has the latest live from Oxford Street. 

NIGEL KIRK [ON TV]	Patrons and staff at this west end department store could have little idea just 20 minutes prior to closure that the day would end in horror. That’s when three men, dressed in burkas, posing as female customers, produced an arsenal of axes and hammers, and smashed their way through glass security cabinets. Their target, designer watches. Witnesses explained how the smashing glass sounded like gunshots, sending both customers and staff running for cover. Others said they thought it was a terrorist attack. A 29-year-old man was rushed to hospital with a head wound, after he was struck with a hammer by one of the gang, after pursuing one of the robbers. He’s now said to be in a stable but serious condition. 

MARCUS	Good, you fuckin’ slag. 

NEWSREADER	Detectives from Scotland Yard’s Flying Squad have recovered a motorcycle used in the raid, and are now pursuing evidence. 

MARCUS	Pursuing evidence? Them dogs ain’t got nothing. 

KWAME	Bike’s untraceable anyway. 

DOMINIC	I reckon we should just ease off for a bit, let the old bill run out of steam. 

NICKY	But they ain’t on us.  

DOMINIC	Listen, we’re sitting on a nice lump of dough at the moment, and I’ve got -  

SHAUN	What you saying? So, we’re off, yeah? 

EMMA	What did mum want?

SHAUN	Nothing. She just wanted to talk to me. 


MARCUS	Where are you off to?

SHAUN	Just gonna go and get lean-up with my lot. 

MARCUS	Don’t bring heat on this doorstep. You understand? 

SHAUN	Of course, I won’t. 

DOMINIC	[LAUGH] 

KWAME	Lean-up with my lot. [LAUGHTER] 

JASON	So, what’s KIRSTEN up to tonight?

DEE	She’s having dinner with her agency. 

JASON	Did they forget our invites, yeah? [LAUGHER] 

JASON	Oh, wicked. This is it. This’ll do. 

DEE	Want some help, mate?

JASON	No, I’m alright. Be sure to put that back. Oh, man. You want to give it here, man? 

JASON	Oh-ho-ho. I love it. 

DEE	Oh, man! 

JASON	It’s a proper heavy reach as well. You can see from three different points down here. [CHUCKLE] Oh, man!

DEE	Nice, Jase. 

JASON	I saw it when I was doing a bike drop down there. I looked up and I was like fuck ya! That’s going to look sick. 

DEE	Jase?

JASON	Yeah?

DEE	Give us a hand, mate. 

MARCUS	We’re likely to get 50 grand a piece for the job today, right? 

DOMINIC	Okay. 

MARCUS	My thing is this – we put the whole lot in, yeah, with our whacks from the shopping mall. 

DOMINIC	It’s about 220 grand altogether, yeah? Guessing, what everybody’s spent. 

MARCUS	Yeah, about 220, and we invest all of it in a load of sniff. 

KWAME	Do you know, that sounds proper. Are we involved? Moving away from robbery, we can chill out with that 220 in a few weeks, just by squeezing out those West Grove dealers from this manor alone. 

MARCUS	Exactly. 

NICKY	Alright, who do you want to buy from?

MARCUS	Chris Reagan. 

DOMINIC	Ooh. 

NICKY	You want to deal with the Reagans?

MARCUS	Yeah, of course. Chris runs his own thing, and his uncles and my old man did blags together back in the 80s. So, I know Chris and I’m tight with him. 

NICKY	Sweet. Branch out. 

DOMINIC	Alright, let’s do it. Sit back and earn some easy dough for a while, yeah? 

JASON	Yeah, you are seriously spraying with best of the best there [CHATTING] – we’ll find the best locations, the highest points. It’s stuff that you wouldn’t even know that you could get to. 

FRIEND	Yeah? Nice. 

JASON	Oy, watch your stencil. I’m not gonna cut you another one. 

FRIEND	Shut up. You’re turning into a right… art princess. 

JASON	Piss off. 

FRIEND	Are you finished then?

DEE	Yeah, yeah, all done. Here, listen, mate. Give me your number and I’ll call you if there’s any Old Bill security around downstairs. Ready to leave, yeah? 

JASON	Yeah, yeah, ready to roll.

DEE	Alright, sweet. 

LEILA	Dee, come in. Come in. How are you doing? Hiya. 

DEE	How are you, good? 

LEILA	I’m good. I’m fine. Listen, I’ve just got to pop downstairs to get a bottle of wine. Philip’s just finishing up. Go and make yourself at home. I’ll be two minutes. 

DEE	Okay, sweet. 

LEILA	See you in a minute. 

PHILIP	Just keep your head up. 

PHILIP	Ah! Great to meet you again, Dee. Thanks for coming by. 

DEE	Yeah, you too, Philip. Thanks for inviting me over. 

PHILIP	Take your coat off. Have a seat. 

DEE	Yeah, cheers. [THEY SIT] 


PHILIP	I saw a really great piece of street art today off Hackney Road. It had a line of riot police, and next to them was a life-size street cleaner with a jet hose washing them off the wall. Captain read, “Just a thin blue line.”

DEE	Yeah, yeah, it’s one of mine. 

PHILIP	I thought it might have been. I really loved how it was done layered, both visually and in the word play. 

DEE	Yeah, well, I like working that way. Um, lots of layers, you know. I suppose that’s how I see life. Do you know what I mean?

PHILIP	Yeah, I know what you mean. 

DEE	To be fair, I didn’t even know that painting was still there. 

LEILA	You’re right, it’s still there. Let me just get some wine glasses. So, Dee, we were chatting earlier, and Philip was asking me how you started out. 

DEE	Well basically, when I was a kid, I used to run around with my brother and our mates. We were what you might call a little gang, and yeah, we used to go around the area and tag our name, which was obviously really important to all of us. And then, if we went into another neighbourhood, well, that was a must-do thing, really. But then, I was also really into the art side of it so, I started doing other stuff which wasn’t just tagging. 

LEILA	And it kicked off from there, right?

DEE	Yeah. 

PHILIP	Oh, Rita, thank you for coming. See you tomorrow. Bye. It’s amazing, isn’t it? What started out in New York in the 1970s as a criminal offense, is now becoming a national artform. I mean even when you started out, it was seen as vandalism. 

DEE	To be honest, Philip, it’s still seen like that by a lot of people. 

PHILIP	Sure, it is. But look, we have graffiti art fetching six figure sums in some galleries, in London as well as Berlin. 

KWAME	What do you say? 

ROCHELLE	He does his banking every Thursday, basically just laundering his weed money, using the shop as cover. So, he has to keep the same routine. 

NICKY	And he keeps it all in the back office, all in one safe? No hiding places?

ROCHELLE	Yeah, all in the safe with the shop’s takings. 

NICKY	Sounds about right. 

MARCUS	Alright, nice one, Rochelle. Talk later, yeah?

ROCHELLE	Later, yeah? [SHE KISSES DOMINIC] Be careful, right? 

DOMINIC	Of course. 

DOMINIC	So, what do you lot reckon?


KWAME	To be honest, I ain’t keen, bruv. I’m still surprised that you’re mixing up with a bird from over the West Grove. 

DOMINIC	Come on. I already told you, she’s got nothing to do with those West Grove pricks. Look, it’s blag that she’s putting up. It’s right on their doorstep. It’s in our manor. She’s sweet. And she knows nothing about us, either, just that we’re grafters. 

KWAME	Now, fair play. It’s good that she lined up the job and all that but I thought she’s knocking risks like this on t he head. We don’t need to be doing shit like this with everything we’ve got coming up soon. A blag like this is street level. What’s the point?

NICKY	Fuck it. It’s just sitting there. Who’s the geezer going to complain to, anyway? The way I see it, it’s just a nice, little touch. 

KWAME	So, what do you reckon?

PHILIP	Tell me how did you make your living? Have you sold any work?

DEE	No. Well, I mean I don’t. 

PHILIP	So, how do you get by?

DEE	Well, I do motorbike couriering when I can, and my brother helps me out too. He’s a good boy like that.  

NICKY	Is this your man, yeah?

DOMINIC	Yeah, that’s him. Karim. He’s got a fucking bird with him. Looks like brass, doesn’t it? For fuck’s sake. [SIGH] So, what, should we split or what?

KARIM	[SPEAKING TURKISH TO CLERK]

KARIM	21,000. 40, 60, 80. 22 grand. Fucking hell, skunk makes my life easy. Putting on some music on, Ursula?

URSULA	Yeah. 

KARIM	Good choice. 

URUSLA 	Yeah. 

KARIM	You feeling frisky? [MUMBLING, FLIRTING] Ha-ha. 

URSULA	Look at you. 

KARIM	I’ve got a lot of work to do, darling. Still got a lot of work to do. Oh, fuck it. Why not? Why not? 

KARIM	[SIGHING] 

KARIM	Fuck, get off! Stay there! 

KARIM	Oh! Oh! Oh! 

MARCUS	Stay down, or I’ll blow your head off!

KARIM	You think you’re bad men, yeah? You’re fucking bastards! 
 

MARCUS	Keep your mouth shut. Shh. 

KARIM	I’ll find you, believe me!

NICKY	Shut up, man! 

MARCUS	Get down. 

KARIM	I’ll kill all of you! I’m going to find out where you fuckin’ live! 

NICKY	Shut up, man? 

NICKY	I suppose a blow job for me is out of the question then, eh?

URSULA	Fuck you! 

NICKY	Where are you from? What country? I love you too. 

DOMINIC	Good, let’s go. 

MARCUS	Let’s tape them up and fuck off. 

NICKY	Up! Up! Down! Down! Down! Get back there. 

PHILIP	Aside from this mainstream collision, do you think that street art still has a rebellion edge?

DEE	Oh, definitely, yeah. 

PHILIP	You know, I strongly maintain that graffiti, satirical street art, like yours, is majorly important. It’s important because it allows people, it sometimes forces people to see life in different terms. I mean even if it just makes people open up their eyes for a few moments. 

PHILIP	It’s worth its weight in gold. 

KIRSTEN	How was that one, good?

PHOTOGRAPHER	Yeah, good. 

KIRSTEN	Oh, perfect. I need like five or ten minutes. 

PHOTOGRAPHER	Okay, cool. 

KIRSTEN	Hey! Hey, what’s up?

DEE	You know, I said I was meeting those art people today. 

KIRSTEN	Yeah, the German guy and then that really cool chick, right, from the Graff Jam?

DEE	Yeah. He’s one of the guys that runs a Berlin contemporary art show. I mean he just laid it on the table. He said he likes what I do, and he wants me to be the British representative for the shop. Would you move there with me? 

KIRSTEN	Dee – 

DEE	Come on, you always say you can work from wherever, and half the jobs you do are abroad anyway.  

DEE	Of course! Yes!

NICKY	Dee! What’s up, brother? I was just getting something from the car. Everyone else is inside, man. Come, you shouldn’t go wait here. Come. What’s going on, brother? I feel nice, bruv. 

BOUNCER	Hey, Nicky. 

NICKY	These are with me, yeah? Follow me. 

MARCUS	Come here. You alright? 

KIRSTEN	Hi. 

KWAME	Another bottle, yeah! 

KIRSTEN	Thanks, yes. 

DEE	Nicky, where’s Kerry tonight?

NICKY	She’s working tonight, man. 

KIRSTEN	Oh, where does she work?

NICKY	She’s a table dancer, a stripper. 

KIRSTEN	Nice. 

MARCUS	Actually, maybe I’ll do it. Don’t worry about it. 

ROCHELLE	You will later. 

WAITER	From the two gentlemen at the bar. 

MARCUS 	[TO DEE] I just want to say well done. Going to Berlin Is going to be the best thing that has ever happened to you. Well done, mate. 

DEE	[TO KIRSTEN] You alright, yeah?

KIRSTEN	Mm. 

DEE	Are you having fun?

KIRSTEN	[GIGGILING] Yeah, it’s sort of like being in a music video. 

MARCUS	Here’s a few grand to stick in your pocket. So now you can knock that courier job on the head and just focus yourself on Berlin. 

DEE	Are you sure?

MARCUS	Yeah, we had a nice little touch yesterday. And I’ve got something big coming up. 

DEE	Sweet. 

JUNIOR	What’s going on, buddy?

WAITER	Junior, my friend, what can I get for you?


JUNIOR	Let me get a table over there, please? See what I’m saying? Levels to this shit fam. Come. Bruv, look who’s there. Leon’s old side chick, you know, fucking with that fuck wad. Look at her. [CHUCKLE] 

ROCHELLE	We can do that later. 

DOMINIC	Alright.

EMMA	Look who’s just walked in. 

JUNIOR	See, I know him. I carved his back up years ago. 

ROCHELLE	What’s the matter? 

JUNIOR	[INAUDIBLE] Second hand slut. 

KWAME	What’s up?

EMMA	Has he got a fucking problem?

ROCHELLE	Get over it. He’s a fuckin’ psycho. 

DOMINIC 	Right. 

DOMINIC	What are you saying?

JUNIOR	What do you mean, what am I saying?

DOMINIC	What are you saying?

JUNIOR	What am I saying? You heard. 

JUNIOR	I’m saying you’re a pussy. 

DOMINIC	Really?

JUNIOR 	Yeah, you’re feeling it? Brother, you – 

NICKKY	Fuck you!

ALL	Fuck you… fuck off… Get off of me…

DOMINIC	Okay, calm down! 

MARCUS	Don’t! Calm down, alright! 

JUNIOR	I know you, you know! I know you! And that slut Emma used to suck my cock. Don’t ever forget that, Marcus. 

MARCUS	Fuck off! Fuck you! 

JUNIOR	I’ll shoot you in the head, you prick! 

MARCUS	Fuck you!

JUNIOR 	You dickhead – you’re fucking done!

MANAGER	No trouble, please! Let’s go! 

DEE	Fuck! 

KIRSTEN	[VISIBLY UPSET] I hate violence. You know, I’m from a sleepy, little beach town outside of LA and I am, I am just not used to that. 

DEE	Yeah, I don’t like violence either. It’s bullshit. And yeah, it scares me too. 

KIRSTEN	Oh well, I’m glad you don’t hang out with your brother and those dudes, you know. I don’t want them pulling you down. 

DEE	Come on, KIRSTEN. They do not pull me down. 

KIRSTEN	No, I don’t mean it like that. Look, I like your brother. I like his friends. They’re cool but u- 

DEE	Look, you’ve got to put it in perspective, alright? Did you see the men they attacked? They are nasty people. When we were younger, they put 45 stitches in Dominic’s back. You know why?

KIRSTEN	No. 

DEE	Because he went to visit his Gran and they live in the same post code. 

KIRSTEN	[SIGH] 

DEE	It’s bullshit. It’s wrong, all of it is wrong. But that’s how it is and I hate it. 

KIRSTEN	I know you’ve had to climb a mountain to get away from this crap and to see life for what it can be. You inspire me. 

DEE	I appreciate that. 

KIRSTEN	No, you’re doing something with your life. And I just, I want you to know that I’m by your side. 

MARCUS	All good? 

CHRIS	Yeah, no problem. 

CHRIS	How you been keeping, well?

MARCUS	Yes, sweet, everything’s going really well right now, Chris. 

CHRIS	Right. That’s what I like to hear. 

MARCUS	Cheers, mate. 

CHRIS	Right. I’ve got 300 K’s worth for you here. 

MARCUS	300? Chris, I said 220.

CHRIS	Yeah, I know. But, if you want 220, it means I’ve got to cut the box in half. Who am I going to sell a half a key to? 300 is a nice, round number. Now, you can take the six or stay with the five. I’m happy either way. 

MARCUS	Yeah, of course, I said six. 

CHRIS	Good man. Course, you owe us eight on the reload. 

MARCUS	Alright, done. 

CHRIS	How’s your mum?

MARCUS	Yeah, yeah, she’s fine. 

CHRIS	Good stuff. You give her my regards when you see her, yeah?

MARCUS	Yeah, yeah, I will do. 

CHRIS	You still seeing that little blond bird?

MARCUS	Yeah, I am, actually. 

CHRIS	How long has this been going on? It’s been going a while, in’it? 

MARCUS	Yeah, it’s been years, mate. 

CHRIS	Want to get married don’t ya? Have some kids. Give your mum some grandchildren. She’d love that. 

MARCUS	Nah, not yet 

MARCUS	Nicky and Kwame here?

DOMINIC	No, they chipped off when we got back. Said they’d be here by now, actually. 

MARCUS	All went well. It’s safely tucked away. 

MARCUS	What’s happening?

NICKY	Went well, yeah?

MARCUS	Yeah, sweet and he credited us 80 grand. 

DOMINIC	80 grand? 

DOMINIC	Yeah. So, that’s 300 altogether?

MARCUS	Yeah, 300. Nice, round number. 

DOMINIC	Where is it?

MARCUS	I stashed it at Emma’s. It’s nice and safe. 

NICKY	Well, that makes sense but we’ve got to keep our heads down for a few days. Then we can start knocking it out. 

MARCUS	Yeah, exactly. 

KWAME	Yeah, at Emma’s is definitely a good shout, yeah. 

DOMINIC	Best idea you’ve had all year, man. 

MARCUS	Yeah, she doesn’t even know it’s there. 

NICKY	She better not know it’s there, otherwise she’ll be out on the town, wouldn’t she? Hungry?

DOMINIC	Yeah, we should eat. 

KIRSTEN	Look at these. Kind of fun. Let me see. Oh, and some jeans. 

CLAIRE	Hey, Dee. 

DEE	Hello. 

CLAIRE	How are you doing? Great to see you again. 

DEE	Yeah, you too. Hello, babe. You alright?

KIRSTEN	Good. How are you?

DEE	Good, sweet. Hold on for a second. 

KIRSTEN	When did the Council do this?

DEE	Fuck knows. Must’ve been recently, last few days, I reckon. 

KIRSTEN	You don’t seem happy about it. 

DEE	No, no, I am but I dunno, it feels like a sell-out. Do you know what I mean?

KIRSTEN	No, absolutely not. This is an accreditation. I mean you said this piece of multi-layered, right?

DEE	What’s, the Perspex adds another layer, yeah?

KIRSTEN	Yes, it does. It actually works perfectly. Hey. 

CLAIRE	Very cool. 

KIRSTEN	Isn’t it? 

CLAIRE	Yeah. 

KIRSTEN	Mm-hm. 

EMMA	Shaun, go get the door. 

SHAUN	No, man, I’m right in the middle of this.

GUY	Get down, down!

TARA	Fucking pussy hole! 

EMMA	Get the fuck off me!! 

SHAUN	[SCREAM]

EMMA	Fuck off! 

GUY	Oi, quiet down. [LAUGH] Shut the fuck up. 

EMMA	Fuck off!! 

GUY	Make that fuckin’ slut be quiet as well. 

TARA	Fuck you! 

GUY	Shut up! 

SHAUN	Oh! 

SHAUN	Oh!

EMMA	You fucking leave him alone! 

TARA	Fuck you! Fucking prick! 

JUNIOR	Where the fuck is the food?

SHAUN	Fuck off. 

JUNIOR	Are you stupid? Are you fucking stupid? The only fucking reason I ain’t killing you right now is ‘cuz my man wants answers. 

SHAUN	You fucking pussy! Ah!

EMMA	Fucking leave him alone!

GUY	Shut up, you bitch. 

JUNIOR	Fuckin’ shut the fuck up!! 

TARA	Leon can’t do his own work, you pussy!

JUNIOR	Where’s the food?

EMMA	I don’t fucking know!

JUNIOR	Where is the food? There’s 300 grand worth of sniff in this flat. [GENERAL INAUDIBLE SHOUTING] You’re not going to say where the food is, yeah? No problem. Burn him. [TARA & EMMA GENERAL INAUDIBLE SHOUTING] Watch. It’s going to burn to the bone. 

SHAUN	[SCREAMING] 

LEON	Shut up! Shut up! Just tell us where the fucking drugs are and we’ll leave!

EMMA	I don’t know what you’re fucking talking about!! You fucking dick! You lot are going to get tortured!

JUNIOR	By who? Huh? Kwame? Marcus? What the fuck are those pussy holes gonna do? You tell me where’s their fucking food and we’ll go. If not, I’m gonna drop both your knickers, and fuck the pair of ya. We’re gonna run a train on you, then on you. Don’t play games with me, Emma. You know me. Where the fuck is the food?

JUNIOR	You want to play like that, yeah?

GUY	Hold her down. Hold her down. 

JUNIOR	Oi, I’m going first. [LAUGH] 

EMMA	No! No! 


LEON	You ever been to jail before? I seen a man’s face peel off right in front of my two fuckin’ eyes. It was like a mask running around the jail screaming like a little bitch. And then he just passed out… in shock – face nowhere to be seen. Yo, yo, yo, relax, relax, relax. You ain’t going anywhere. 

LEON	Your sister sounds like a good fuck. 

JUNIOR	[LAUGH] 

LEON	She wants to be a gangster. See, those men in there, they don’t give a shit. They’re going to fuck her all night. 

EMMA	No!!

LEON	I’m serious. 

TARA	[SQUEAL] 

GUY	Shut up, you bitch!

TARA	No! 

LEON	You see, this naughty game you’re playing, give up. Give it up straight away. Because I know for a fact the big stash is in this house somewhere, and you’re due to tell me exactly where it is. Because, no matter how much money your pricks are paying you to stay silent, it’s no use now, bruv, it’s no use to you now. 
KWAME	What you wanna do, head back northwest for a few drinks at Emma’s?

MARCUS	Nah, let’s go the long run M20 to Dover. 

KWAME	Alright, sweet. 

LEON	Alright, fuck it. 

KERRY	It’s Marcus. 

NICKY	[INTO PHONE] Yeah, hello. 

MARCUS	[ON PHONE] Where are ya?

NICKY	At Kerry’s. We crashed out, yeah?

MARCUS	Come to Emma’s. Something bad happened. 

NICKY	What?

MARCUS	Just get here as quick as you can

NICKY	Yeah, no worries, I’ll be – 

MARCUS	I fuckin’ knew it. Fucking whore. 

NICKY	She’s all of it. Do you see what I’m saying?

MARCUS	Let’s go. Stay behind me. 

NICKY	Yeah. Ready, yeah?


JUNIOR	What the fucking hell is this?

MARCUS	Junior! [GUNSHOT] [GENERAL SCREAMING, SHOUTING] 

GUY	Fucking hell! Junior! [GUNSHOTS, SCREAMING, SHOUTING] 

GUY	Ah!

GUY	Under the passenger seat! [GUNSHOTS] 

MARCUS	Get the car! Get the car! [MORE GUNSHOTS, GLASS SHATTERING] Get to Leon. Go! [MORE GUNSHOTS] 

MARCUS	The neighbours! Fuck! Fuck! 

DOMINIC	Marcus! 

MARCUS	Go! Go! Bleedin’ go! 

JASON	Yeah, I’m already here. What’s taking so…? [PAUSE] Oi, yeah, I’ll meet you at – yeah, the bottom of the steps. Alright, take it easy, bruv. Right. Can I have a light, please? 

SECRETARY	Yeah. 

JASON	So, you work at this bank then? 

SECRETARY	Yeah. 

JASON	Thank you. Ooh. Thank you very much. 

SECRETARY	You’re welcome. 

JASON	Have a good day. 

JASON	Take your time?

DEE	Piss off. Jase, what did you want to meet here for? The place is full of security and cameras.

JASON	It’s all part of it, bruv. 

DEE	What the fuck’s that?

JASON	It’s all part of it. Now, come on. 

JASON	You press the handle, the stamp extends out of the base. 

DEE	That is brilliant! Mate, that is brilliant. 

JASON	It just means you can go covert pretty much wherever you want. 

DEE	Where’d you get it from?

JASON	Hey, contacts, my friend, contacts. Well, it’s for you, anyway. It’s kind of a going away present. 

DEE	Serious?

JASON	Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DEE	Mate, I could do so much with this stuff. 

JASON	That’s why I want you to have it, bruv. 

DEE	Thank you, bruv. 

JASON	No worries. When are you going away, anyway?

DEE	Next week. 

JASON	Fuck. 

DEE	KIRSTEN is buzzing. So am I. 

JASON	You lucky get. 

CHRIS	You ain’t got any phones on you, have you?

MARCUS	Of course not. 

CHRIS	Pull up a chair. 

TIM	Relax. You’re alright here. 

CHRIS	This is Tim, one of my cousins. So, you got robbed then. 

MARCUS	Yeah, everything. They took the whole lot, and they took some very bad fuckin’ liberties while they was doing it. 

CHRIS	So, I’m guessing that was the firm that got shot up in the west end the other night then. Had to be done. We got no chance of getting the sniff back, and I’ve heard that the mob’s out there looking for you, and they ain’t gonna give up. 

KWAME	Yeah, and a few other people from some other firms got caught up in the crossfire too. But it was the only way. 

CHRIS	So, you’ve probably got half the gangs in west London after you. 

MARCUS	Fuck ‘em, Chris! They come for me, they know what they’ll get. 

CHRIS	What about the Old Bill? 

KWAME	We’re all laying low. None of us road back. We’re all tucked away. 

CHRIS	I don’t mean to be the bearer of more ball-ache for you but some Asian fella reckons you lot have done his safe, given him a kicking, and tried it on with his missus. He’s put up a lot of dough to have you properly ironed-out. Some bird grassed you up, apparently. 

CHRIS	Anyway, luckily for you, you approached a couple of fellas that work for us so, you’ve got a bit of breathing space. Just bear in mind that he will try somewhere else, sooner or later. Okay? Maybe a firm from over the river, maybe a firm from up north. I suppose you could just take the money he’s sticking up and tell him we buried them under the motorway, split it two ways, and you stop buying your fags in his corner shop, eh? [LAUGH] 


MARCUS	Listen, we’re fucked. All the money we had went into sniff we bought. 

CHRIS	Aren’t you forgetting something?

MARCUS	Yeah, and your eight. Chris, look, I’m really sorry about that, mate. I promise you I’ll get that back. I swear. Look, we ain’t got a penny right now and we need a heavy score.

KWAME	So, we can get back to where we was and, if need be, put those fuckin’ West Grove dealers out of business for good. 

CHRIS	Well, that’s why I brought Tim along today. He’s got the details on something you might be interested in. 

MARCUS	What is it?

TIM	It’s a big job, a serious amount of money to be made. But it ain’t smash and grab. This is firearms, full planning. Chris said that you’s could handle it. [PAUSE] But I ain’t gonna stick it up to you if you’re then going to turn around and say no. 

MARCUS	No, we’re up for it. 

TIM	Right. We’ll fence the goods for a 20% commission, and we get 10% of the overall for sticking the job up. 

MARCUS	Done. 

TIM	Kraff’s, the jewelers on Bond Street, they’re going to have a consignment of special gems – diamonds, gold jewelry – within the next week or so. You’re looking at a face value of at least 20 million quid. 

PHILIP	Thank you. [TAKES A SIP] Very good.

DEE	Nice one. 

PHILIP	Cheers. 

DEE	Yeah, cheers. [THEY TOAST AND DRINK] 

PHILIP	Your flights are booked, for both you and KIRSTEN. 

DEE	Oh, thank you, Philip. I mean we would have bought KIRSTEN’s ticket ourselves. 

PHILIP	It’s not bother. We have a deal with the airline, and the office should email them to you today. 

DEE	Alright, sweet. I’ll text KIRSTEN so she’ll know. 

PHILIP	I think you’ll like the flat they found for you. Sorry you couldn’t view it first. 

DEE	No, no, it’s just digs, isn’t it? I’m grateful. 

MARCUS	This is New Bond Street. There’s Kraff’s. Taxi pulls up, and me and Dom are gonna get out, and walk in like we’re customers. You alright with that? 

DOMINIC	Yeah. Yeah, of course. 

MARCUS	But it has to be convincing. They don’t just let anyone in there. 

DOMINIC	Alright. So, where’s the goods?

MARCUS	The shop’s on two floors. The top floor is where the jewelry with for the clients. Downstairs, on the lower floor, that’s where the cabinets are. That’s where the new gear is. I’ll keep everyone upstairs, the jeweler, the security guard, and anyone else. All the cabinets are finger-key locked so, you take the blonde bird down there, and she’ll open all of them for you. 

KWAME	And I’m going to be waiting here or thereabouts, as close to the shop as possible. There’s around a 90-second police response time, and Chris is going to be plotted up there, and it’s a one-way street so, the police can only get in from this direction, and Nicky, I need you to be there on the bike. 

NICKY	Don’t worry. I’ll be there. 

KWAME	You alright, bruv? 

MARCUS	Yeah, I’m cool. I’ve just got a few things on my mind. I’ll just be an hour or so, and we’ll go through the plans again. 

DOMINIC	No worries. See ya. 

KWAME	See ya in a bit, yeah? Keep your eyes open. 

MARCUS	Yeah, of course, mate.

LEON	Did you wrap it up?

SHOOTER	Yeah, it’s done. 

GIRL	Marcus! 

PHILIP	Everything okay?

COP	Stand back here, sir. 

DEE	My brother’s in there. 

NADINE	He’s my son. 

DOCTOR	Three entry wounds, three exits, immediate transferal. 

DEE	What’s happening?

DOCTOR	We’re taking him into theater. 

EMMA	I told him not to come and see me. I said they’d be watching. 

DEE	Come on. Let’s go. 

BAXTER	Excuse me, mate. Excuse me. [SHOWS HIS BADGE] Detective Sargent Baxter from Trident, Anti-Gang Gun Unit. Can I have a word?

DEE	About what? I don’t know nothing. 

BAXTER	Look, we can have a private chat in the car or we can go and talk at the nearest nick. 

KIRSTEN	I think you should probably just go with him. 

DEE	Yeah, fine, wait for me in the café, alright?

KIRSTEN	Yeah, of course. 

BAXTER	What’s your relationship to Marcus Canaan?

DEE	He’s my brother. Derin Canaan. 

BAXTER	Who do you think shot him?

DEE	I ain’t got no fuckin’ idea. 

DETECTIVE	You’ll have to do better than that. 

BAXTER	Well, there was a shooting last week. Two members of the West Grove got killed. Your brother’s name’s been mentioned, along with the names of his three known associates. 

DEE	I’m not involved in that world so, I can’t help you but my brother is basically a straight guy. That’s all I can tell you. 

BAXTER	[CHUCKLE] Well, let me tell you something. Your brother and his three mates are wanted men, and if we don’t nick ‘em first, they’re dead. We’ll be waiting for Marcus when he recovers but it Dominic, Nicky and Kwame want to reach old age as free men, then they need to come and see me so we can sort this out because, believe me, the other lot will turn Queen’s evidence the first chance they get. 

DEE	[INTO PHONE] Hello? 

KWAME	[ON PHONE] Got to meet up. Be quick, yeah?

DEE	Yeah. [HANGS UP] Alright, I need to leave you here, alright?

KIRSTEN	Is everything okay?

DEE	Yeah, fine. I just need to go somewhere, alright? I’ll be back soon. 

KIRSTEN	Okay. [THEY KISS] 

KWAME	We’ve got a job in two days. 

DEE	You’ve got to be joking. Boys, Old Bill’s got a special squad out looking for the three of you. With the heat on you now, boys, you better bury yourselves. 

NICKY	I know what you’re saying, Dee, but this is a once in a lifetime score. We’re talking millions each. It’s big-league. 

DEE	Alright, easy, look, I don’t even want to know about that. 

DOMINIC	You’re missing the point. There’s going to be enough money for us to just dust, get out, disappear. To be honest with you, we ain’t got any other options. 

KWAME	We’ll have enough to pay for some people we know to break Marcus out of hospital. 

DEE	Marcus is under armed guard and no one is busting Marcus out period. The second he’s moved, the Feds are going to have him banged up, pending trial. 

DOMINIC	Then we’ll bust him out of the van on his way to court. 

DOMINIC	Alright, look, let’s say Marcus does get sent down, are you telling me you don’t want your brother to have three and a half mill waiting for him when he gets released?

DEE	Dom, Dom, what are you telling me for?

NICKY	We need you to be the fourth man. The job can’t be done without four of us. It’s all been planned. There are some heavy people involved but it’s our job on the ground, and there ain’t no one else we can trust to bring in. 

DEE	You’re on drugs. Think about what you’re asking, alright. You know it ain’t my game. I wouldn’t even know what to do. And my brother’s all shot up in hospital, looking at 25 years. 

KWAME	Dee, listen. There’s no other option. Otherwise, we’re dead. We need the money for protection so we can all get out. Your brother needs the money or trust me, he’s as good as topped already. We’re all on hit lists. I mean serious hit lists. Do you understand? 

DOMINIC	There’s no risk for you. We ain’t asking you to do anything you can’t handle. We just need you nearby to take the goods away on a motorbike. You’ve just got to take a bag, like a courier, and keep it safe until we come collect it later. That’s it. That’s all it is, Dee. 

DEE	No, I’m sorry, boys. I can’t do it. 

DEE	Yeah, I’m alright, just a bit drained, you know, a bit wasted. 

KIRSTEN	Do you want me to come over? Because I will. I can come. 

DEE	No. No, I’m alright. I’ve got to go, alright? But I love you. 

KIRSTEN	I love you too. 

DEE	[TO EMMA] You alright? 

EMMA	Yeah. Thanks. 

DEE	I didn’t know what was going on. Marcus never said nothing. 

EMMA	It’s alright, Dee. I just want Marcus to be okay. 

DEE	Fuck! Mum! Mum! Mum, get up! Now, come on! Let’s go!

DEE	Fuck! 

NADINE	What the fuck have you done!? That’s my fuckin’ life! You bastards! You fuckin’ – Dee! [CRYING] 

MARCUS	Emma was here. She told me them cunts fireballed the flat last night. 

DEE	It’s alright. I was there. I put most of it out before the firemen even got there. 

MARCUS	Have you spoken to the boys?

DEE	Yeah. 

MARCUS	Do whatever it takes to get us out of this shit. 

DEE	What, you want me to do it?

MARCUS	Dee, just do it. I need you to do it. We’re in a bad fuckin’ way here, mate. Do you understand? [SIGH] 

DEE	Alright. I’ll handle it. 

COP	Here, Guv. 

DEE	[ON PHONE] Hello, it’s me. 

KWAME	[ON PHONE] Alright, so, what’s happening?

DEE	Alright, I’m in. 

KWAME	That’s sweet. It’s on for tomorrow, okay? So, listen, yeah? 

VOICE ON PHONE	Hi, Dee. It’s Philip. I’m in Berlin now. You left in a bit of a hurry the other day. I hope you’re okay. Anyway, call me when you land in Berlin. See you in a bit. 

DOMINIC 	Keep the change, yeah. 

SECRETARY	Good afternoon, gentlemen.

NICKY	Good afternoon. [PULLS OUT A GUN] Keep your hands by your side. [TO GUARD] Get over here, over here! Over here! Sit! Sit! 

DOMINIC	You too. Hands on the table. Look natural. You, blondie, downstairs. Let’s go now. 

NICKY	You stay tightly where you are and keep your head down or do you wanna put one straight in your nuts? 

DOMINIC	Open it now. Come on, quickly. Next one. Go. Go. Move. 

DOMINIC	Come on, quickly. 

DOMINIC	Let’s go. 

DOMINIC	Open the door. No alarms or we start shooting. 

NICKY	You’re coming with us. Come on. You’re coming for a little walk. Behave yourself and you’ll be okay. Come on. 

DOMINIC 	Thank you. 

MANAGER	Help! They robbed us. Hey… hey, they robbed us. Hey…hey. 

KWAME	What the fuck’s he doing? 

DRIVER	Fuck’s sake. Watch where you’re fucking going! 

COP	Hey! Move the van! Move this fucking vehicle!

CHRIS	I’m sorry. I’m just reversing. 

COP	Move! Get out of here! 

NICKY	You fucking idiot! 

NICKY	Oh fuck!

DOMINIC	For fuck’s sake! 

NICKY	Fuck! Don’t let them get too close. They can have it. 

NICKY	Alright, fuck this. 

COP	Under fire. [GUNSHOTS] 

KWAME	Good, Nick, good!

POLICE RADIO	Suspects armed, suspects armed. 

KWAME	Alright, put your visor down, put your visor down!

KWAME	Don’t leave nothing in the car. 

DOMINIC	Take mine. 

NICKY	Yeah. 

NEWS READER	Three armed robbers were shot dead this afternoon by officers from the Met’s Flying Squad, as they fled the scene of a violent holdup in London’s Mayfair. A spokesman for the Met has said that a fourth suspect, who escaped on a motorcycle is still at large. All sea and airports have been put on alert. 

DEE	Fuck. Fuck. [PANTING] 

KIRSTEN	Hello! Babe, you home?

KIRSTEN	Hey. 

DEE	Hey, you all good? You all packed?

KIRSTEN	Yeah, I think everything is almost in order. I went and said bye to some people, and [GIGGLE] look at how cute you are with your motorcycle boots and your sweat pants. I love it. [PAUSE] Babe, are you okay? Hey… you don’t look so good. 

DEE	Yeah. No, I’m fine. I’m just, I’m just worried about Marcus and my mum, that’s all. 

KIRSTEN	Aw. I know. [KISSES DEE] Okay… 

KIRSTEN	Time to go. Okay. [TO CLERK] Hi. 

CLERK	Hi. 

KIRSTEN	okay. 

CLERK	Where are you traveling to?

KIRSTEN	Berlin. 

CLERK	Berlin? Okay, great. 

KIRSTEN	Here’s my passport. 

CLERK	You passport, please? Okay. So… 

KIRSTEN	We’re going to check two bags. 

CLERK	Okay, just put them on the belt. 

KIRSTEN	Okay. I’m going to take this one off. This is from my last trip. And we have two more bags. 

CLERK	Okay. 

KIRSTEN	Okay. 

CLERK	Only two pieces?

KIRSTEN	Are you checking in your bag too? Yeah? 

CLERK	Any more bags?

KIRSTEN	Yeah, just one. 

CLERK	Okay. 

KIRSTEN	I’ll put it right here. Okay, you only have that one, babe. 

CLERK	This is for you. 

KIRSTEN	Perfect. Thank you. 

CLERK	Enjoy your flight. 

KIRSTEN	Danke shön. 

CLERK	Danke shön.

KIRSTEN	Okay, so, we go yes, this way. Okay, we’ll go through, have a little coffee, and chill out for a little bit. 

DEE	Yeah, sweet. 

KIRSTEN	You have flown before, right? 

DEE	What?

KIRSTEN	I’m kidding! You are just so on edge this morning. 

DEE	Sorry, I’m spaced. Sorry. 

KIRSTEN	Can I come? Okay. Oh. Okay, right here. Thank you. Sorry. 

INSPECTOR	Is this your bag?

DEE	It’s not a bag. It’s a stamp. I use it for my artwork. Cheers. Thanks. 

KIRSTEN	It was so funny with the customs agent. I kept thinking what in the world is he thinking? That’s the thing that Jason gave you, right, the stamp thing? 

DEE	Yeah. 

KIRSTEN	Oh my god, babe, it’s awesome. I can’t wait to see it in action. 

DEE	I’ll make some stencils for it as soon as we settle in. 

KIRSTEN	Do you know what you should do? You should stamp the floor with it here. We can like leave our mark and no one would ever know. 

DEE	No, no, no. It’s not worth it. I don’t want to cause any trouble. 

KIRSTEN	[GIGGLE] 

DEE	I’m going to go to the bathroom. 

KIRSTEN	Okay. [SIGH] 

NEWS READER	The identities of the three armed robbers, fatally wounded by Flying Squad officers in a gun battle yesterday, have been revealed as Nicholas Miller, 24, Kwame Bernasco, 28, and Dominic Johnson, 25 of North London. Officers from the Met’s Trident unit have connected the men with London gangster, Marcus Canaan, who is currently in hospital under police guard, recovering from gunshot wounds sustained in an underworld attempt on his life one week ago. Two robbers entered the exclusive Kraffs Jewelers on New Bond Street yesterday afternoon, and threatened staff with handguns. They took a female hostage with them, and made away with an estimated £20 million of precious gems and jewelry, the largest theft of its kind the capitol has ever seen. 

MANAGER	Help! They robbed us. Hey! Hey! 

NEWS READER	The police are calling it an audacious crime. The thieves opened fire on security guards and members of the public as they made their getaway. 

COP ON TV	During the extended car pursuit, the robbers were cornered by officers and opened fire. The ensuing engagement resulted in the deaths of all three suspects. However, officers did not recover the stolen jewelry, and we are now hunting a fourth suspect believed to have escaped on a motorcycle with the stolen goods. 

DEE	Come on. Let’s go to the gate. 

KIRSTEN	Those are Marcus’ friends. Those are your friends. Did you know about this?

DEE	Yeah, I heard. What? What do you want me to say? Come on. Let’s go. 

KIRSTEN	Take it. Just take it. 

KIRSTEN	One day, when you’re ready, I think you owe me an explanation. 

DEE	Yeah. Promise. 

DEE	I’m Dee. 

KIRSTEN	Good to meet you. 

DEE	[INAUDIBLE]

DEE VO	In my opinion, earth is eating away itself. Hi, how are you doing? 

WOMAN	I’m opening a contemporary section and I’m very interested about this piece. 

DEE	Oh, very, very nice. 

DEE	[INTO PHONE] Hello? Alright, bruv?	

MARCUS	Well, bruv? How’s the exhibition going? Better be good. 

DEE	Yeah, all good. I… I wish you was here. 

MARCUS	Don’t worry about me, mate. I’m doing just fine. 

DEE	Yeah, yeah, I know. 

MARCUS	Listen, when you are finished over there, you two should come out here. Chill out for a bit. 

DEE	Yeah, well, we’ll see what happens. 

MARCUS	Alright, sweet. 

DEE	Alright, sweet. 

MARCUS	Talk soon, yeah?

KIRSTEN	It’s so good. 

DEE	Do they like it? 

KIRSTEN	Yeah, I think so. 

DEE	Excuse me. 

KIRSTEN	Yeah, of course. 

DEE	Sorry about that. 

WOMAN	Yeah, I was… 

KIRSTEN	I knew it was going to happen. It’s good. 

DEE	Thank you, babe.
