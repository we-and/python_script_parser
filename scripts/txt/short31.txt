THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see!

THE EARL OF SODOR	...But, just how closely are you watching?

THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I’ll be asking questions about what you’ve seen.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Harvey and Samson have been asked to collect the scrap metal from along the tracks.

THE EARL OF SODOR	They do seem to be doing an extremely thorough job of it don't they! But what's this??

THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?

THE EARL OF SODOR	What kind of scrap did Harvey put into Stanley's car?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Was it a bicycle? Was it a bucket? Or was it a bath?

THE EARL OF SODOR	That’s right. It was a bicycle and it wasn't scrap. It was the postman's bicycle... Ha! Ha!

POSTMAN	'Hey, bring my bike back...' 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Did you get it right? Oh, very well done! Let's play again.

THE EARL OF SODOR	Thomas is a steam engine and uses his whistle to let everyone know that he's on his way...

THE EARL OF SODOR	Toby is a Steam Tram and he has a…bell!

THE EARLOF SODOR	And Paxton is a Diesel engine. He sounds his  horn.

THE EARL OF SODOR	 How does Percy let everyone know he's on his way? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Does he sound a bell? Or a whistle? Or a horn?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Yes. Percy 'Toot, Toots' with his whistle.... to say “hello” to his friends! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Did you get it right? Oh very well done! Let’s play again. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Ah! Here comes Gordon, pulling the Express. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	He’s going very fast, as he starts to climb Gordon’s Hill. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	But wait…what’s this? It looks like some kind of danger flag. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	What colour was the danger flag, which made Gordon stop?

THE EARL OF SODOR	Was it blue? Was it yellow? Or was it red? 

THE EARL OF SODOR	Yes! The danger flag was red. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	But it wasn’t a danger flag at all! It was a pair of red pants. Gordon does look rather silly. 

THE EARL OF SODOR	 Did you get it right? Jolly well done.  

THE EARL OF SODOR	I think you deserve a ‘Really Useful Certificate’ for watching so closely! 

THE EARL OF SODOR	And I hope I’ll see you again soon… Goodbye!
