chris	what?

rachel	that’s what he was barking at! i know it! he hated that thing even more than i do.

chris	sweetheart, i am sorry. i am really sorry.

rachel	just go. go to work.

chris	i can’t leave you like this.

rachel	you don’t need to waste a whole day trying to make me feel better. i’m not going to.

reporter	it’s been three weeks since the death of ramsey theodore sambino, the man that police are saying killed seven women over the past two years under the alias known as the violator.
reporter	but we still know very little about what led the solitary man to commit such atrocious acts.

singer	here i am. dreaming of you.

singer	wouldn’t you be my dream

singer	come true

paprazzi	rachel! rachel!

mom to baby	don't cry

man	i love you

violator	this is not how it ends!

chris	rach, you sound insane.

rachel	chris, i’m telling you, the drone was trying to communicate with me. it was operating the tv.

chris	wait, now the tv is in on this?

rachel	you’re not listening to me, as usual!


chris	baby, have you been drinking tonight?

rachel	chris! i’m not drunk! and i’m not insane! ok? i saw it! i saw it take words from peoples’ mouths to form this message and then lightning struck and the tv turned white.

chris	a drone did this?

rachel	i’m starting to think you didn’t even take those pictures.

chris	what pictures?

chris	jesus.

chris	babe. why didn’t you tell me about this.

rachel	i tried too. i thought you didn’t want me to know.

chris	i didn’t do this.

chris	maybe

chris	it was being driven by the drones previous owner.

rachel	no

rachel	these pics are dated.

rachel	the drone put these on the desktop for me to find.

rachel	oh. and this.

chris	wait.

rachel	and that’s not all. the drone moves around the house by itself

rachel	first it’s here. then it’s there.

chris	okay. wait. hold on.

chris	you know what? maybe.

chris	there’s something wrong with this.

chris	this didn’t come with the drone you know.

chris	oh wait, maybe the drone is reacting to a different controller.

rachel	this is more than a wrong controller chris..

chris	listen. maybe whoever bought the drone has the controller. probably :

chris	lives in the neighborhood. and i bet has been trying to call the drone home.

rachel	the drone is controlling itself!

alarm	wee woo wee woo wee woo

filip	well it’s not supposed to do that

filip	let me take a look at it and see what’s going on.

filip	come on baby. uh. well outside looks fine.

filip	do you have any like random signals bouncing around your home that might have interfered with the drone.

chris	you know what? last night our security system went totally haywire.

filip	see. that’ll do it. probably some stray signal from your security system got into the drone and “vvh vvh vhh [makes drone and that’s it.

filip	but just to be on the safe side can i see the remote.

filip	alright.

filip	huh. oh. looks like your remote is not paired with your drone. which is weird cuz it shouldn’t be flying at all.

filip	ehh don’t worry about it. it’s an easy fix.

filip	and alright. paired up. let’s take her for a spin shall we.

chris	here?
