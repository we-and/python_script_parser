(THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL 5)




LI HONG	The Witch has taken your appearance. Everyone thinks she is the chosen one! She forces the Dragon to execute people.

CHENG LAN	If the Master has the Dragon Seal, how are they able to control him?

LI HONG	Look, isn't that you?

CHENG LAN	Now I understand why the overseas sculptor made a bust of me. They used it as a cast!  Kho Tchai? What are you doing here? Where is Jonathan? Jonathan Green! He is my friend! We have to warn him that he's in danger!

WITCH SERVANT	Today we are blessed on Earth, Our lovely Princess, beautiful as the Moon comes down on Earth to blesses us today with her pearly, glowing countenance! And now you'll be forever so grateful! Behold! This girl has been lazy…and failed to pick her quota of tea leaves. Surely she can work better, and is worth keeping alive! But her fate may only be decided by one will…the Dragon!

JONATHAN GREEN	Sorry!

CHENG LAN	Be careful, you're in mortal danger. We need a map of the palace to save you.

JONATHAN GREEN	As an Englishman grateful to his gracious hosts, I wonder…would the Princess be interested in me making a detailed map of the kingdom?

WITCH	You may commence work at your convenience.

JONATHAN GREEN	Well I suggest we commence immediately!

CHENG LAN	She has everyone fooled! It looks like she's using the ancient magic… but that isn't the real Dragon Seal at all!

GIRL	Oh, Great Dragon! Save my grandfather! Aaah! Grandpa!

JONATHAN GREEN	What's happening? What is this? 

CHENG LAN	How is this possible? How could she force the Dragon to do this?

LI HONG	This place is no different from a prison. Once you come to this village, you can never leave again.We've tried to handle the guards…but the Dark Wizards are helping them, so it’s useless.
 
LI HU	Sister, are you hurt? 

LI HONG	This girls’ grandfather was executed today, her mother was sold into slavery. Here, please, don’t cry. I promise we'll get your mother back.

CHENG LAN	Do you know the Dragon song? Sing it for me...

WITCH SOLDIER	Silence! Enough singing. You'll sing a different song on the plantations tomorrow! And left! 

PETER THE FIRST	Frightening… but quite interesting!

MERCHANT	These are Russian traders here to buy our tea! They want to buy all the tea in the village!

SOLDIER	Let them in!

MERCHANT	Oh thank you! Please come!  This way…

PETER THE FIRST	Oh, finally, the ground!  I'd love to eat something…as long as it's not a seafood.

SELLER	Scorpions! Live scorpions! So delicious! Live scorpions! Try some!

PETER THE FIRST	I'm not really hungry!

SELLER	Try this tea!

MISS DUDLEY	Why are you doing this?

PETER THE FIRST	I’m looking for the Princess.

SELLER	Look! He has the Dragon Seal!

LI HU	Sister! I saw the Dragon seal! Some foreigner has it... He is with the guards!

JONATHAN GREEN	A-mazing! This isn't magic. It’s just science…

MISS DUDLEY	Well, I'm wondering if you have forgotten, that you promised me to search for my husband. Well, I would really appreciated if you could stay focused on that and not let ourselves be distracted! And stop behaving like an idiot and for goodness sakes stop showing this thing to everybody. And... What happened? 

SAILOR	Fellas, where is the Tsar??

SIRKO	Where is the Tsar?

MISS DUDLEY	What happened?

CHENG LAN)	Don't move or I'll break your arm! What did you do to my father? How did you get this seal? Who are you? 

PETER THE FIRST	Cheng Lan?

CHENG LAN	How do you know my name? 

MISS DUDLEY	Hands up!

PETER THE FIRST	Thank you, darling!

MISS DUDLEY	I am not your darling! 

PETER THE FIRST	So I want to hear your story now.

CHENG LAN	We've arrived here from Moscow…A wonderful man saved me from certain death...His name is Jonathan Green. 

MISS DUDLEY	Jonathan! Oh…

PETER THE FIRST	Wait, wait, wait...I suppose it was the best journey of his life! Full of wonderful discoveries! Just two of them. A lot must have happened I would think!

CHENG LAN	Yes, there were different situations. But I must say, I always felt good and safe around him.

MISS DUDLEY	Where is he?

PETER THE FIRST	Miss Dudley, please!  I'm sorry, Princess! This is his fiancé. His wife. Mother of his son. Anyway…

MISS DUDLEY	I don't need any excuses…

JONATHAN GREEN	Aeh... You chops know where the bathroom is?  I'm a servant of the Queen! Unhand me! I'm a British…

WITCH	Do you still not understand where you are? I am the law here, and my power is boundless.

JONATHAN GREEN	What powers?! I have seen your inventions... Spears, arrows… These are bronze toys. From a bygone century!

WITCH	You're a blind man, just exactly like all the others! I didn't resurrect any ancient army. I just put my soldiers in invulnerable armor! We've learned to control lightning and we can control the power of sound…And very soon, when I have the Seal of the Dragon I will rule the world! And you are the perfect bait! When she finds out I’ve decided to execute you…she’ll deliver herself right into my hands. Take him away!

MISS DUDLEY	Where the hell did you bring us?

CHENG LAN	I believe it's my turn to ask questions. So… How did you get my father's seal?

PETER THE FIRST	I am very grateful to your father. Both of us were imprisoned in the Tower of London. All those long British evenings he kept teaching me the secrets of his amazing art! And I learned a lot from him!

CHENG LAN	Should I believe you?

PETER THE FIRST	You don't believe me…Well, watch! What are you laughing at?  I broke the chains and I stopped a storm like this!

CHENG LAN	Give them back their weapons.

MISS DUDLEY	Thank you.

PETER THE FIRST	Now you actually do believe me. I can say that you are the true princess. Take it. This is yours. 

CHENG LAN	I'm very grateful to you!

PETER THE FIRST	Chinese monster?

CHENG LAN	The map! You might not believe this, but this creatures are from Russia.

MISS DUDLEY	This is Jonathan's handwriting!

LI HONG	Do you know what it is? Do you understand?

PETER THE FIRST	I know how to read it. We'll need a…

M DUDLEY/CHENG LAN	Mirror! Mirror!

WITCH SERVANT	Oh my rising Sun... The moon has come down from heaven! I have good news! I have brought them! Here!

ZHONG ZHE	Princess, please forgive us... We were unable to find your father. I swear to serve and protect you for the rest of my life!

WITCH	Is this really all you have to tell me about your long trip?

ZHONG ZHE	We have found the Dragon's seal.

WITCH	You've found it? So give it to me!

ZHONG ZHE	A nobleman has it. The Russian Tsar Peter the Great!

WITCH	Zhong Zhe stay here. And you - bring me the Russian Tsar!

ZHONG HAO	Princess!  But how are you? Who…Who’s in the palace?

LI HONG	She's an evil witch! She uses a mask with the princess' face and rules in her stead!

ZHONG HAO	Our brother just swore to give his life in service of that witch!  She tricked all of us!

ZHONGYI	Princess, he’s only in love with you! He never would have been faithful to her if he knew. 

PETER THE FIRST	The Witch and her servants believe that the Palace is inaccessible. He made a very accurate map. We can get in through the cave under the water. My Cossacks can do a lot of things! They will release Jonathan Green… and you will get to your Dragon.

CHENG LAN	My people can also attack the palace by air.

PETER THE FIRST	What do you mean, by air? 

CHENG LAN	Jonathan Green is not only a great cartographer, he is a great scientist!  He has calculated everything precisely according to the flight of a bird. Please, go gather all the umbrellas in the village.

LI HONG	Yes, tell them!

REBEL	OK.

CHENG LAN	I will get to the Dragon, show him the seal and hope he recognizes that I am the true princess. We also need to come up with new weapons to break through their defenses. I suggest we use pepper! We will answer their spears and arrows with pepper from our crossbows. It remains to be seen how we will deal with the Magicians.

PETER THE FIRST	She thinks that I have the seal, so it will give us some more time!

MISS DUDLEY	I'll go and prepare myself too. I need to change the dress! I can't fight in this… The battle is commencing. Help me with my corset! 

CAPTAIN	I’m not your servant, lady! Alright! Take me with you. You won’t regret it!

MISS DUDLEY	I'll think about it. 

CAPTAIN	Woah, you wanna kill me?! 

MISS DUDLEY	You bastard! Or I'll kill you! Good luck!

CAPTAIN	What about me?

SOLDIER	Hey, stop! What do you need that many umbrellas for?

BOY	It's gonna be hot today. 

SOLDIER	Will it be that sunny?
