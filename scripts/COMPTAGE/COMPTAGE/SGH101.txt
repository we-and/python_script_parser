NOLA	I would like you to know the only reason I’m doin’ this is ‘cuz Folks think they know me. They think they know what I’m about and the Truth is they don’t know me.

NOLA	Anyhoo if in the end this helps some other People out then that’s cool too. I consider myself “Abnormal.” But who wants to be like everybody else? Not I. Some People call me a Freak and I Hate that Word. I don’t believe in it or better yet I don’t believe in one word Labels. But what are you gonna do? Ya Feel Me?

NOLA	I love walking the Beautiful and Nitty Gritty Streets of New York City. But sometimes walking the Beautiful Nitty Gritty Streets as a WOMAN can be, well, BRUTAL. Peep this bullshit...

BLACK MALE #1	Why don't you sit on my dick and peddle my balls? Haha!

BLACK MALE #2	Excuse me, Miss, but you so Fine I’d drink a Tub of your Bath Water out of a Champagne Glass. You wanna know why? Cuz’ ya Mom’s Placenta was filled with Holy Water. God blessing You girl. Mm, good God!

BLACK MALE #5	Hot Thang, you look so good Jesus on the Cross must be doin’ ya Taxes. Sheeeeeet.

JAMIE	I truly believe that there is only One person, only One in this World that is meant to be your Soulmate, your Lifelong Companion. The Joke is rarely do these Two People Hook Up. They just wander about aimlessly, Lost in The Sauce. Y’know God is a Trickster. In Life, God doesn’t give you the People you want, instead he gives you the People you need. Nola Darling is my need.
JAMIE	Another great lunch. How come we always make Love in your Bed?
NOLA	Now you know I can only make love in my own “LOVIN’ BED”. Besides we ain’t Doin’ it in your Bed.
JAMIE	So does it possess Magical, Mystical Powers?

NOLA	 Uh-huh.

JAMIE	Now I’m Possessed.

NOLA	You think so, Huh!!

MARS	YO!!! What about Nola Darlin’? What do you wanna know? I think Nola is a Freak.  Y’know, Y’know, Y’know, Freaky Deaky. Deaky Freaky. Freaky to Da Deaky. Deaky to the freaky. Yo, Check it. Most Dudes want Freaks. I do. I do. Do I? I do.

NOLA	Okay...

MARS	Alright, moment of truth baby. Dang! You okay if I put my bike here?

NOLA	Yeah, it's fine.

MARS	Dag, it took you long enough to invite me in.

NOLA	Dag, I don’t just let anybody up in here. So what, is Mars a nickname?

MARS	Nah, it’s my Gov’ment. My Moms she named me Mars cuz’ she said “I’m outta dis Universe.” Alright?

MARS	 Dope.

NOLA	 It’s not finished.

MARS	Still Dope.

NOLA	My Born Day is May 19th.

MARS	Happy Early Born Day.

NOLA	Mars, Malcolm X was born on May 19th, too.

MARS	No disrespect. Denzel did Da Damn Thing. And got robbed of that Academy Award.

MARS	That was some Shenanigans, some Subterfuge, straight Skullduggery.

NOLA	He was too black. Too Strong. Al Pacino though? Come on.

MARS	Don’t Hate on Al Pacino. Scarface, dat’s my Joint.

NOLA	You know what a Make Up Call is in Basketball?

MARS	Does Mars Blackmon know what a Make Up Call is in Basketball? Is Barry White? Is Al Green? Is James Brown? Is Prince Purple?

NOLA	It was a Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Make Up Call. Pacino got Fucked 4 times. He got fucked over for the Godfather and the Godfather II, Serpico and fucked again big time for Dog Day Afternoon.

MARS	Damn, Sam.

NOLA	So they give Pacino his long overdue Oscar and then Denzel gets his Make Up Call Oscar for Training Day, which he shoulda Won anyway. So the Academy still owes D another one. And I know they better not fuck him over for Fences.

MARS	Word to Da Mother. You know lot ‘bout Movies, huh?

NOLA	I’m a cinephile.

MARS	 A cinewhat?

NOLA	A cinephile. A Film Enthusiast.

MARS	How you... How you afford dis joint? Ya Family got it like dat?

NOLA	No, my parents are artists.

MARS	So are mine. Really?

MARS	Well yeah, my pops is an artist.

NOLA	A con-artist ?

GREER	One Ninty-Six (196), One Ninty-seven (197), One Ninty-Eight (198), One Ninty-Nine (199), Two hundred (200). Oooh, go Greer.

GREER	I’m the best thing that ever happened to Nola Darling. Ask her. She’ll tell you that herself. That woman worships me. What a pair. What a couple we make. When we are together, It’s on like hot butter popcorn. We are a Dynamic Duo. A Terrific Twosome. Legendary Lovers... I can keep going if you wish, if you... If you so desire.

NOLA	Ahh, Michael Jackson spin. 

GREER	I got a lion in my pocket and baby, he is ready to roar.

NOLA	Was that the Cowardly Lion, or Snagglepuss even ?

GREER	Can't no other dudes hit it, the way I'm 'bout to now. Greer, your wallin'. Don't talk, okay?

GREER	Oh, Nola ! Nola ! Nola ! Nola ! Greer !

NOLA	What ?!

GREER	Do you realize you are gazing upon the Bi-Racial Adonis? You know I’m Fine as SHIT.

NOLA	Greer, you’re the Epitome of Narcissism. Don’t you get tired of You?

GREER	Never happen.

NOLA	I bet you love yourself more than Kanye loves Kanye.

GREER	There’s no Crime in Loving One’s Self, in fact, that is the Greatest Love of All. I can sing it like Whitney if You Wish.

NOLA	 I Don’t Wish. Huh, voilà! 

GREER	WDF, Nola ! What Da Fuck?

NOLA	What? It’s your ugly Inner Self, Greer. I call it “Sexy Beast”.

GREER	No! Alright, you know the deal, it's time to go. I got another piece to start.

GREER	No... But the tongue... Huh, posing all this damn time for this bullshit. It was almost good, Nola.

NOLA	Bye Greer.

GREER	Don’t front though. Ain’t no dudes ever put it down the way I did today. 
CLORINDA	Nola and I used to be Roommates, until we had a slight Fallin’ Out. I can’t lie, it was a big fallin’ out. We are still cool, still Friends, we just can’t live together. And By the way, don’t ask me anything about Mars Blackmon, ever. OFF LIMITS. I’d get up early in the Morning, on my way to Jivamukti vinyasa class and I run into all these Randos in our Bathroom.

CLORINDA	Nola!

CLORINDA	 Not okay. Nola and I talked about it but like she said...

NOLA	I found this crib and if you can’t Hang, maybe you should start lookin’ for another place of residence.

CLORINDA	Bye!

CLORINDA	I said “Bye” and I got my own Brownstone apartment in Fort Green. What could I do? Nola’s name was on the Lease. Regardless, Nola is still my Girl.

NOLA	I’m carrying my entire portfolio on the C train during rush hour, And this dude bumps into me, like BAM! Hard. I swear he did it on purpose. Knocks all of my Drawings on the nasty subway floor. People were literally stepping on my fingers pushing to get off the subway. Like, I’m just trying to pick up my Shit, and it’s like I don't even exist.

SHEMEKKA	I woulda lost it.

NOLA	So I get to my interview 15 minutes late. I open up the portfolio : foot prints on all of my Drawings.

RACHEL	No!

CLORINDA	Oh my God, what did you do?

NOLA	I had to show’em as is, so I freestyled. I spit out everything I learned at Pratt Institute! I dug deep. By the end, I had them thinking the foot prints were like some dope Basquiat conceptual touch.

CLORINDA	Ha! Love that!

MILLER	Hey, Ladies.

ALL	Thank you.

CLORINDA	What is this?

MILLER	The FO-GRE Cucumber Martini.

CLORINDA	This taste like Moonshine brewed in Bushwick. 

MILLER	Ma'am, it’s what you ordered.

CLORINDA	This is not Goose. I can taste the Three dollar difference.

MILLER	Really?

CLORINDA	Really!

NOLA	Clo! You know what, it's a...

CLORINDA	Your beautiful beard and sense of entitlement do not intimidate me.

MILLER	I'll be right back with your drink.

CLORINDA	Thank you

NOLA	Was all of that Drama really necessary?

CLORINDA	Absolutely! I'm standing my ground. I'm not going to cede the Fort to Hipster imperialism.

SHEMEKKA	By the way, what the Fuck is FO-GRE?

NOLA	Or Noho, Noha,

CLORINDA	SoBro, Bedwic

RACHEL	or BoCoCa.

NOLA	Translation: All acronyms for places we can no longer afford to live.

SHEMEKKA	Hello. $6.99 for a quart of Milk from the Arab Bodega in my hood?! They must be out their Goddamn minds.

RACHEL	Well, it is organic.

NOLA	Nope. No dice.

RACHEL	Okay.

SHEMEKKA	Wow. I dunno what he put in my drink, but this Shit taste good.

CLORINDA	Some people are not so particular.

MILLER	I hope this is to your liking.

CLORINDA	Much better. Thank you.

NOLA	Nice.

RACHEL	Salud!

CLORINDA	To Nola. I’m very excited to see the beautiful things that you make and experience this next year.

RACHEL	I double that!

SHEMEKKA	And here's to droppin’ Shit on the C train and turn that shit into Art.

NOLA	To this! To my beautiful Friends. To not succumbing to distractions.

CLORINDA	Oh, is that what you’re calling “Them” now?

NOLA	Oh see, no no no. What we're not gonna do is discuss my sex life over born day cocktails. Not gonna do that cliché.

SHEMEKKA	Too bad.

NOLA	And stop seeing everyone’s success as my failure. I had this Professor who always use to say that just because you know how to hold paint brush, that doesn't make you an Artist. It’s the act of guiding that brush to places that no one's ever been or wouldn't dare to go that defines you. 

RACHEL	To Nola. Cheers!

NOLA	Wow!

JAMIE	Happy Birthday.

NOLA	Thank you!

JAMIE	I come bearing gifts.

NOLA	I see. What is all this?

JAMIE	I got you some art supplies.

NOLA	Oh my goodness, thank you. 

JAMIE	Yeah, no problem.

NOLA	What else you bring me?

JAMIE	Wouldn’t you like to know.

JAMIE	Go ahead, make a wish.
NOLA	Perfect end to a Perfect Born Day.

JAMIE	You like?

NOLA	Yeah, this Cake is on Point.

JAMIE	Happy birthday.

NOLA	Thank you for coming. Excuse me.

NOLA	Pronto!

MARS	Yoo!!! Nola!!! Happy Born Day.

NOLA	Thank you.

MARS	 You're welcome. Yo, it’s Me, Mars.

NOLA	I know.

MARS	 Come Hither. Let’s go for a Romantical Bike Ride and Shit.

NOLA	That sounds real dope but I'm in for the night.

MARS	What, in the Bed? In the Lovin’ Bed? What, with who the Fuck who? Yo, let’s celebrate your Born Night. Yo,I could ride my Custom Built by Me Bike over there in Five minutes. Young is the Night. Night is the Young... and Shit.

NOLA	I can't, it's too late. Call me in the Morning. Goodnight.

NOLA	Sorry. Seriously?!

MARS	WAKE UP!!! WAKE UP!!! WAKE UP!!!

LOURDES	Yo! Gimme the Phone.

MARS	Chill. My Phone is Dead. Nola.

MARS	Nola.

NOLA	What do you want?!

MARS	Nola, just let me smell it.

LOURDES	Uhh, you're disgusting!

MARS	Come on, hit me off, just a quick Whiff.

NOLA	You are so dumb!

MARS	 A Lil’ Sumptin’, Sumptin’. Please Mamí, Please Mamí, Please Mamí, Please Mamí, Please. Por Favor.

LOURDES	Oh My God. Stop Cakin’ on My Damn Phone. You One “Thirsty Ass” Half Nigga. MARS LuLu, you a Half-Nigga too!!!

LOURDES	And half a Butter Rican.

MARS	Shut the Fuck Up!!

NOLA/LOURDES	Shut the Fuck Up?

MARS	No. Not you, Nola. I’m tellin’ my Stoopid Ass Sistah to Shut Da Fuck Up... 

LOURDES	Yo, give me my shit back.

MARS	Hold da Fuck up. Is Dude there? In our Lovin’ Bed?

NOLA	Adios.

LOURDES	You can’t keep ya Ho’s in check?

MARS	Nola’s not a hoe. But Roxanne on the other hand … She's about to get it.

NOLA	Oh my goodness.

JAMIE	Who was that?

NOLA	A friend.

JAMIE	What kind of friend? A man friend. We’ve discussed this.

JAMIE	You know what? Forget I mentioned it... I wrote you a Poem instead of giving you a Corny Ass Hallmark Birthday Card.

NOLA	Well that was sweet of you.

JAMIE	As I said when I first met you, Investment Bankers can be Poets too.

NOLA	Isn’t that Two different parts of The Brain?
JAMIE	Well see God, he held his hands on me a little longer.

NOLA	I bet.

JAMIE	Your name leaves my lips, the moment I wake from slumber. I call out to you: Nola Darling! My anguish cry surfed the wild wind. Through the black Brooklyn blocks, from Ocean Hill Brownsville, never run, never will, to Bed-Stuy, do or die, in Fort Green, don't be so mean. They find their way to you, Nola Darling.

MARS	Yo, dat’s the Wackest Shit I ever heard. And what’s Wacker is dat your Fine ass fell for it too. Dayum, Yo!! Nola, I don’t mean to Bad-mouth whoever wrote that Ca-Ca on a Stick but he ain’t got game. Straight Cornball. His Poe-Try is not the Answer. I’m the Answer like Iverson. I’m also a Dope Poet and ya ain’t even know ititititit. I got Mad Skills. Amongst my many multiple Talents, I’m also a dope rapper. Check this Funky Fresh Joint.

NOLA	Puff, Puff, Pass.

MARS	Gotcha. 

MARS	Some girls got beauty, some girls got grace. You're so black perfect, you win the God damn motherfucking race. Yes, yes, yaahh! Some freaks got style, some freaks got class. But Nola got that in the tight...

NOLA	Did you just call me a Freak?

MARS	Yeah, that I did. Did I that?

NOLA	What the fuck does that even mean? I mean you call me up Mad Late at Night talking that “Can I Smell It?” freaky bullshit. Ain't that the definition of a Freak from The Urban Dictionary?

MARS	Hell Yeah, I’m a FREAK. Nola, I Fly my FREAK FLAG Sky High. Ain't no Shame In My FREAK GAME.

MARS	Tight booty!! Tight booty!!

MARS	Yeah baby! Yeah that's good!

MARS	Do I “Hit It” as good as them Off-Brand Dudes? Y’know ya got Mad Room for all my Jordans underneath you bed, right? Oh my God.

MARS	We could go good like Beans and Rice here together.

NOLA	I told you from jump don’t catching any Feelings.

MARS	It’s like that.

NOLA	It’s like that 10 X 10.

MARS	Close ya eyes. Come on, close your eyes. Yo don't be looking.

NOLA	I won't.

MARS	'Cause you'd be looking.

NOLA	When?

MARS	You a looker.

NOLA	What?

MARS	Don't be looking.

NOLA	Okay.

MARS	Alright? Damn girl! You got that booty. You ready? You sure?

NOLA	I'm sure.

MARS	Alright, open your eyes.

NOLA	They're open.

MARS	Did I ever tell you I used to to work at VICTORIA SECRET? Yo. This how I used to get'em. I used to be like: “Yo, baby girl, watcha need? You need a razor back? I gotcha. Bang! Whatcha need, gel lining? I gotcha.Bang! You want a bomb shell? Chill, you don't need two cup sizes bigger. Love yourself.”

NOLA	What?

MARS	You got the cheeky, the cheeky. I bet you ain't know I knew all that.

NOLA	How you still living in the projects but you got like eighteen (18) jobs?

MARS	Yo, why you coming for me? I'm saving money. That's why I got a savings account.

NOLA	What are you saving money for what?

MARS	I'm trying to buy this Brownstone so you ain't got to rent no more. It's just you and me.

GREER	I Love the scent of your sweet Pussy in the morning. It smells like Victory. Robert Duvall uttered those Classic lines from Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now about 8 million times better than you.

GREER	OK, sister Roger Ebert, answer me this: am I your only Fuck-Buddy?

NOLA	Why are you asking that?

GREER	You’re a Sex Addict, aren’t you?

NOLA	WOW!!! You are on some other Light Skin, green eye, blonde Hair, Pretty Boy Bullshit Today.

GREER	Me thinks you are a Sex Addict.

NOLA	Okay, so if I’m a sex-addict, what does that make you?

GREER	I'm Greer Childs. I’m a Grown Ass Man.

NOLA	And I’m a Grown Ass Woman. I can't enjoy Sex? If I'm such an addict, why don't you leave me the hell alone?

GREER	Wait now you’re getting defensive.

NOLA	No no no no no, I'm not getting defensive. If I’m an  addict then I should quit cold turkey, right? You are Numero Uno on my list.

GREER	Shower?

NOLA	Fuck you very much.

GREER	Shower.

JAMIE	Nola, what are you searching for?

NOLA	Again?

JAMIE	Do you think you’ll ever find it? It being whatever it is you are looking for?

NOLA	Honestly, I’m just livin’ my Life, trying to figure out this Artist thing. Goin’ with The Flow.

JAMIE	Yeah, what about me?

NOLA	This is it, Jamie. This moment is what it is.

JAMIE	What about my Flow?

NOLA	What about your other TWO “FLOWS”?

JAMIE	It’s complicated.

NOLA	Yeah, exactly.

JAMIE	Y’know what? I’m out like Durant.

NOLA	What? Well you know what? If I was Kevin Durant, I would have left Country Ass Oklahoma City, too. OKC over San Fran stucco-free city ! Get all the way the fuck outta here!

CLORINDA	Y’know  you and Mars is still asore subject to me. You broke The Code, girl.

NOLA	Well, that wasn’t my intention. That Crazy Mutherfucka just makes me laugh.

CLORINDA	I know. He made me laugh too... Past Tense.

NOLA	What do you want me to do, Clo ?

CLORINDA	Have you ever thought about givin’ ya Coochie a rest? 

NOLA	What? My Coochie gonna Get Up and file for Worker’s Comp?

CLORINDA	She ain't gonna get much.

CLORINDA	I don't know, doesn't it get confusing, juggling all of them at the same time? Like don't you get ‘em mixed up?

NOLA	No Slipups yet.

CLORINDA	Greer, he got that strong Dick Down Game. Right? Mr. Dick-Tator?

NOLA	You forgot Dick-O-Logist.

CLORINDA	And how’s your Sugar-Daddy?

NOLA	He’s not my Sugar-Daddy.

CLORINDA	Color it in for Me.

NOLA	He just takes care of me. Next question.

CLORINDA	How is your Art Work Comin’? Pun intended.

NOLA	It’s Comin’. No Pun Intended. 

CLORINDA	I know you live down the block, but call me. Love you.

CLORINDA	Call me when you get home.

NOLA	Thanks Mom.

CLORINDA	Welcome sweetie.

SLICK WILLIE	Sexy, Sexy, what's your name, girl?

NOLA	Can I help you? God..

SLICK WILLIE 	Yo! Ay yo MA! Yo Ma!

NOLA	My Parents gave me a Name and it ain’t “Yo Ma” !

SLICK WILLIE	Bitch I'm trying to talk to you!

NOLA	What? Get the fuck off of me!

SLICK WILLIE	Wow, chill girl!

NOLA	Get your motherfucking hands off of me!

SLICK WILLIE	Fuck you then! I ain't want that stank pussy anyway! Motherfucking black bitch! Fuck! Shit.

NOLA	You ever heard of Akira Kurosawa? Well you should. Kurosawa is one of the All-Time Masters of Cinema, Japanese Director. One of my favorite Kurosawa Joints is RASHOMON. That Film came out in 1951, shot in beautiful Black and White Photography. It’s about a Rape, a Murder and several Witnesses who all saw the same Crime but from entirely different viewpoints. 

NOLA	Some might say I have a “Rashomon Effect” on Jamie, Greer and Mars. They all view me differently but I will not allow them to Paint My Life. Paint who I am. I’m dealin’ with who I am now... at this Moment in Time and Space. And I gotta look within to feel what makes ME HAPPY.

NOLA	And if Jamie, Greer and Mars want to Deal with me it's gotta be on my own terms. No Less, No More. And nyone who can’t get with The Program can Step. Go with God. One, Two or Three Fingers can not Block out The Sun. The Truth is The Truth. I’m not a Freak. I’m not a Sex-Addict and I’m damn sure nobody’s Property. 

NOLA	My Name isn’t DIME PIECE!!! My Name isn’t BOO!!! My Name isn’t BABY GURL!!! My Name isn’t Psssst SHAWTY!!!  My Name isn’t MAMACITA!!! My Name isn’t SWEETIE!!! My Name isn’t  AY  YO MA!!! My Name isn’t SEXY SEXY SEXY!!! My Name isn’t HOOCHIE MAMA!!!  My Name isn’t HONEY!!! My Name isn’t SWEETHEART!!! AND MY NAME DEFINITELY AIN’T NO MUTHAFUCKIN’ BLACK BITCH!!!

NOLA	My Name is Nola Darling. Peace. 2 Fingers. #BLACK LIVES MATTER.
