??	Did I mention how nice it is to meet you?

??	There I was, just minding my own business in the library,

??	and there you were in the True Crime section--

??	which is my personal heaven.

??	Let me show you mine.

??	Mm-hmm.

??	Uh-huh.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Yes.

??	Oh, my God,like that!

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	So I wasn’t kidding about loving the True Crime section.

??	What’s your excuse?

??	Cops and robbers when I was a kid.

??	I was always the robber.

??	I’ve just always been fascinated...

??	by the psychology of a man...

??	that <thinks he can get away with murder.

??	Do you think you could?

??	I’m not a killer. I didn’t ask if you were.

??	I asked if you thought you could get away with it.

??	Yeah.

??	I think I could.

??	Tell you what.

??	"The Murder Club"?

??	Just check it out.

??	It’s a game.

??	But you look like a girl that likes to take risks.

??	And my number’s on there too, so give me a call sometime.

??	Are you a member of this Murder Club?

??	Now that would be telling now, wouldn’t it?

??	Ah.

??	James... Mason.

??	Member, the Murder Club.

??	You’re working late.

??	This place is amazing.

??	Must be nice to inherit the family manor...

??	along with the newspaper-editing genes.

??	The front page for the Weekly is still too light.

??	We need something substantial to go above the fold.

??	Well, you got anything?

??	Actually, what about the test-stealing scandal?

??	Just came out a few days ago. I could cover that.

??	Aw, it’s not enough to go on.

??	It’s just some student starting a rumor.

??	But if it’s true, it’s a good story.
	
??	You’re not covering it, Kayla.

??	It’s a nonissue.

??	But I can <get> the story.

??	See this? Says "editor."

??	Your badge says "reporter."

??	That means I get to decide the stories.

??	I just think it’s a mistake not to dig into this.

??	We’re still on notice with the science lab funding,

??	and the paper can’t afford  to take any more risks.

??	You’re goodat your job, Sam.

??	Better than I could be, with all the politics.

??	Can we please not talk about work anymore?

??	What did you want to talk about?

??	You... kissing me.

??	Go, Sam. Go, Sam!

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Hey, what’s this?

??	I was trolling stories. Thought it looked interesting.

??	It’s here on campus?

??	Yeah, I know.

??	You know, I thoughtyou might want  to look into this one.

??	"You’ll be in class one day  and the rumor will start,

??	’Did you hear? They found a body.’

??	But you won’t stop there. You’ll ask questions and look for clues.

??	Are there things the police don’t even know?

??	Can you find the killer before they strike again?

??	It’s not a game, but there are players.

??	Can you pit your skills against theirs,

??	or will you mark yourself as the next victim...

??	of the Murder Club?"

??	Guess you’ll have to find out.

??	You know, I want you to work with Marissa Simms on this one.

??	That girl has no filters,

??	and I don’t even know if she can write.

??	She’s new, that’s all. She’ll get skills.

??	And that’s why I need you to mentor her on this.

??	Sam-- Take it or leave it.

??	I’ll call her.

??	Kayla! What are you doing here?

??	I left a message on your cell.

??	Sam gave us an assignment, and I wanted us to get started.

??	Us? Why?

??	Can I come in?

??	Sure.

??	Did I interrupt something?

??	Nope. Just working on a story.

??	Yeah? What is it?

??	Something I found online, thought I’d check out.

??	Well, that’s kind of  what this is,

??	and when I pitched it to Sam,he said I should bring you in on it for training.

??	Well, that’s really nice, but I’m okay on my own.

??	And that’s what I told Sam, 

??	but basically, he insisted we work together,

??	so basically, if we want our stories to run, we take our orders from him.

??	Can I get you something? Iced tea?

??	Sure. That’d be great.

??	Thanks. Mm-hmm.

??	So what’s the story?

??	Have you heard of the Murder Club?

??	Were you looking through my stuff?

??	What stuff? My laptop.

??	How else would you know about the Murder Club?

??	Whoa! I saw their Web site online and pitched it to Sam.

??	Wait. You’re already working on this?

??	How did you find out about it? Same way you did--

??	online.

??	Okay. Maybe you are the right person to work with on this.

??	Don’t do me any favors. Sorry.

??	Look, I didn’t mean it that way. Let’s start over.

??	I think we’re probably interested in a lot of the same things,

??	and I know we could cover more ground working as two people than working alone.

??	So would you be interested in working with me on the Murder Club exposé?

??	It could work.

??	Okay, cool.

??	So I tracked down someone I think is a member--

??	a girl named Nina Vernon. 

??	She’s a criminal justice major, which is where...

??	I think the whole idea for the club came from.

??	How did you get Nina Vernon?

??	From her blog post signature.

??	I was able to track another blog she posted to,

??	and found her info through that. Nice work.

??	I have one confirmed, one possible...

??	and I’m working on a third.

??	Who’s confirmed?

??	James Mason. 

??	How did you get confirmation?

??	I slept with him. He told me.

??	Do you wanna work on my possible, Rick Taylor, or should I?

??	I know Rick.

??	Perfect.

??	So it shouldn’t be a problem for you.

??	I’m not seducing him for information.

??	That’s unethical. We’re not lawyers.

??	We’re reporters.
	
??	I don’t think working together is such a great idea.
	
??	Fine, but the Murder Club story is mine.

??	The Murder Club story belongs to whoever prints it first.

??	Good luck getting your story looked at without a mentor.

??	Good luck getting yours looked at without sources.

??	As if I’d ever sleep with Rick Taylor for information.

??	 I’m so glad you could come over.

??	I was told that you would be the perfect person to talk to...

??	about a story that I’m researching.

??	How do you know Kayla?
	
??	She did a story on premed majors,

??	and I’m the only clinical biology specialist in my department.

??	Premed? So you’re gonna be a doctor?

??	An M.E.

??	I didn’t think anybody actually chose medical examiner as their profession.

??	That must be why you’re in the Murder Club, huh?

??	M-Murder Club? Okay, I get it.

??	The first rule of Fight Club and all that.

??	I’m going to get a beer. Do you want one?

??	Eh. Oh, come on.

??	It’s Friday night. I’m asking a favor.

??	At least let me make it up to you with free beer.

??	Okay. If you insist.

??	I insist.

??	Okay, Rick Taylor,

??	let’s see if you’re really involved with the Murder Club, shall we?

??	Gotcha.

??	Criminology report written by Rick Taylor and Nina Vernon.

??	Okay. So it’s possible.

??	Maybe... you’ll let me buy you lunch tomorrow.

??	Hi, Sam.

??	Yeah, I saw Marissa earlier today at her apartment.
	
??	Why do you ask?

??	No, we’re not working together on the paper...

??	because she’s unethical and a bitch.

??	Why don’t you ask her?

??	Okay. I’ll go over there tomorrow and make up with her.

??	Is that good enough?

??	No, I’m not going tonight because I’m already in bed.

??	Do you want to join me?

??	Yeah. No, I get it.

??	Have a good night.

??	Are your eyes closed?

??	Yeah.

??	Okay, now open them.

??	Wow.

??	See?

??	I told you I could surprise you.

??	Now it’s my turn.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Fuck, yeah!

??	Fuck, yeah.

??	Mmm.

??	Yeah.

??	Oh, fuck me!

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah!

??	God!

??	Oh, yes!

??	Fuck!

??	Oh, yes.

??	Oh, yeah!

??	Oh, yeah.

??	God, yeah.

??	Oh, God!

??	Oh, God.

??	Fuck, you’re gonna make me come.

??	Yes!

??	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

??	Don’t stop. Please!

??	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! 

??	Yeah. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

??	Hello?

??	Hello?

??	So you have no idea where Ms. Martin was last night?

??	Who she was with?

??	When I left yesterday  she was alone,

??	and we’re not good enough friends that she would confide her plans to me.

??	Yet, you’re here today.

??	I told you, Detective Ross,

??	I came to apologize.

??	We were assigned to work together, and it didn’t start out well.

??	Would you say the relationship between the two of you...

??	was acrimonious?

??	I would say it’s nonexistent.

??	We were coworkers, not friends.

??	I barely knew her.

??	I have a class. Can I go now?

??	I have your information.

??	Make sure to be available if I have any further questions.

??	I’m not going anywhere.

??	See that you don’t.

??	Make sure to favor the wounds on this side.

??	Oh, crap.

??	Nina Vernon? Yeah.

??	I’m Kayla Stark. I’m here to talk to you about the Murder Club.

??	The what? I know you’re a member.

??	I traced your blog account.

??	And who are you?

??	I’m... a friend of Marissa Martin’s.

??	I don’t know anybody named Marissa.

??	She’s the latest corpse on your Web site.

??	I’m sorry, I think you’re gonna have to leave.

??	My next stop is the police, Nina.

??	Whatever makes you happy. 

??	That went well.

??	What the hell was that?

??	She’s a reporter for the school paper.

??	We’re supposed to shut her down. Shut her down?

??	If she had an off switch, I would have hit it.

??	You’re pretty sexy when you’re mad.

??	She said she’s friends with the Martin girl.

??	Listen.

??	I told you, I don’t know anything about either this girl or Marissa Martin,

??	so unless this "friend" killed the Martin girl...

??	and left me some clues, I’m not interested.

??	Well, that’s the problem.

??	She’s a little <too> interested.

??	She’s not your problem, Nina.

??	I promise.

??	Oh, then who is?

??	I am.

??	The Martin girl,

??	she’s not really dead, is she?

??	They never are.

??	Good.

??	Hmm.

??	Yeah.

??	Still available to answer a few questions, right? Right.

??	So here’s the thing.

??	I just saw Marissa Martin’s crime scene photos on the Web.

??	You don’t look surprised. I saw them too.

??	And you didn’t call me.

??	If I found them, how long could it possibly take for you to find the same thing?

??	I’m just a student. You’re a cop.

??	You lied to me...

??	about what you and the deceased were working on together.

??	I didn’t lie.  You didn’t ask.

??	I’m asking.

??	Apparently you already know.

??	I was investigating somethingcalled the Murder Club,

??	which seems to be based  on our campus.

??	My editor assigned Marissato me to mentor,

??	and she wasn’t happy about it.

??	I wasn’t happy about it. But whatever. You work it out.

??	So what?

??	Marissa Martin just ends up the poster child...

??	for this... Murder Club?

??	I’m not the idiot who put her there.

??	Yeah. Well, I think your computer would say otherwise.

??	What are you talking about?

??	What I’m saying is, I got a warrant here...

??	to take your computer into the police lab for analysis.

??	Why?

??	Because your e-mail signature...

??	was ghosted onto the photograph that the unfortunate idiot posted online.

??	But I didn’t do it.

??	Maybe you didn’t do it,

??	but your computer did.

??	I’ll see myself out.

??	Would you just calm the fuck down, Kayla?

??	You’re making me jumpy. I thought you hated science.

??	I do. But would you just settle down and collect your thoughts?

??	They took my computer, Sam.

??	My whole life is on that thing.

??	I got it. You’re freaking out, Kayla, okay?

??	But what you need to be doing is going out there and gettin’ that story.

??	If it makes you feel better, go do a piece on police corruption.

??	Do whatever you gotta do to stay busy and keep your mind off the Murder Club.

??	But they have something to do with Marissa’s murder.

??	They are the story.

??	Well, then tell me what you know about them.

??	I know a couple of the members, and I suspect another.

??	Names, Kayla. Facts.

??	James Mason and Nina Vernon are confirmed. Rick Taylor is suspected.

??	Do you know any of them? Never heard of them.

??	Yeah, but three people don’t make up a club.

??	There are other members out there.

??	And according to the blog post, at least one other ringleader type guy.

??	We need facts, Kayla. Anything else would just be conjecture that we can’t print.

??	It’s all about the story to you, isn’t it, Sam?

??	What can I say? I get a hard-on for a good story.

??	Read any lately?

??	Is that all you get a hard-on for?

??	I don’t know. Got a good story ?

??	Maybe.

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah. Give it to me.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Yeah. Don’t stop.

??	Yeah. Yeah. Right there. Right there.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, Frank. You scared the crap out of me.

??	Kayla, we have to talk.

??	Do you want a drink or something? Sure, if you’ll have one too.

??	Wine on the counter.

??	Do you know a girl named Marissa Martin?

??	Yeah. She just started working at the newspaper.

??	Now she’s dead. Why?

??	I slept with her the night she was killed.

??	She really did it.

??	Did what? Marissa said she was gonna have sex with you...

??	to get you to talk about the Murder Club.

??	Awesome. Was it?

??	I wouldn’t think you’d care.

??	I don’t. It’s not my business.

??	I only told you so you’d get that I have a connection to this.

??	And I know what I’m talking about.

??	You didn’t kill her, did you? Uh, no.

??	I didn’t kill Marissa.

??	So then what do you mean you have a connection?

??	I’ve been a part of this Murder Club for a couple months now.

??	Ever since I did a criminology paper with Nina Vernon.

??	I read it. It’s well-written. Thanks.

??	So the whole deal with this club is two things:

??	One, someone will post an actual unsolved murder,

??	and it’s our job to research the facts around the death...

??	and come up with our own theories about who did it.

??	Or, if there isn’t a proper corpse,

??	then someone will make up clues...

??	and they’ll fake a murder to solve.

??	So it was just an intellectual exercise.

??	It was.

??	You mean, before Marissa.

??	I don’t know what happened to Marissa.

??	But the fact that the crime scene photos...

??	were posted an hour after I left her house--

??	It freaks me out.

??	You think someone from the Murder Club killed her?

??	I think someone’s trying to frame you for killing her.

??	Hey, Sam. I need to talk to you.

??	It’s about my story. Apparently someone’s trying to put me in it.

??	But at this point I don’t know what to believe anymore.

??	Can you call me? I could really use your brain on this.

??	And your hands and your mouth wouldn’t be bad either.

??	I knew James was lying to me about knowing the Martin girl.

??	I’m telling you, Nina, you cannot trust them.
 
??	They all talked to her, and now she’s dead.

??	Which makes the whole club suspect when the cops dig in.

??	Then we have to let it go. We have to erase everything.

??	You’re freaking out, Nina. Relax.

??	Everything will be just fine, I promise.

??	I just don’t trust anybody.

??	Not since that bitch  started this whole thing.

??	Don’t worry about Kayla. She’s not a threat to you.

??	Will you spend the night with me?

??	Absolutely.

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh.

??	Yeah.

??	Oh, sh--

??	Yeah!

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, yeah!

??	What did you just do, Kayla?

??	Sent myself the photo.

??	Well, we’ll make sure your fingerprints stay on my computer keyboard...

??	so it’s clear you planted the p oto and tried to frame me.

??	You’re part of the Murder Club, aren’t you, Sam?

??	Whatever gave you that idea?

??	Of course.

??	When I found that Web site open on your computer,

??	you hadn’t been trolling for stories.

??	You had just posted something to the blog page.

??	I’ve been trying to track down Red  this whole time, and it was you.

??	Red . Like have you read one of my stories recently?

??	My God, Sam. You’re incredible.

??	Your arrogance is truly epic.

??	You thought you could putnot only one  but two reporters...

??	on the Murder Club story and stay out of it?

??	You must think we’re seriously stupid.

??	I never thought you were stupid, Kayla.

??	I don’t sleep with stupid.

??	So then why did you put me on the Murder Club story? You wanted to get found out?

??	What I wanted you to do was stay the fuck out of my business.

??	What business? Your computer?

??	All you had to do was make something up about the Murder Club.

??	Say it was a nonstory, like the test-stealing scandal.

??	But it wasn’t a nonstory, was it?
	
??	This is a stolen test, isn’t it?

??	You stole the tests. That’s why you put me on the Murder Club story.

??	Because you didn’t want me to find out about the tests.

??	You don’t think I’m an idiot.

??	You think I’m good.

??	In fact, you know I’m good enough that I would’ve figured out that you did it.  Well, then figure this out, genius.

??	Why would I have put you on the Murder Club story if I was on it?

??	See, here’s the thing, Kayla.

??	You couldn’t stand the idea of working with Marissa.

??	You couldn’t stand her. And she thought you were an arrogant, bitchy know-it-all.

??	Yeah. She called me right after you left her place,

??	and she begged me to let her keep her story.

??	Her story?

??	Well, she did discover it. 

??	And, to be fair, she was the first one to run it by me.

??	And that’s why that damn Web site was up on my computer when you came over.

??	So then why did you let me think it was my story to run with?

??	- I needed you to mentor her. - I would’ve worked--

??	But you didn’t like her. Admit it.

??	The only reason why you would work with her is because you wanted the story.

??	So I put you together to work,

??	but I guess the hatred just runs too deep.

??	She would’ve done whatever it took to get that story.

??	And you thought she was unethical to even consider it.

??	But she couldn’t stop, wouldn’t stop.

??	It was her story, and she was gonna see itall the way through.

??	And this is the way  I see it, Kayla.

??	You went over to her place, after she fucked that little source friend of yours,

??	and you decided that she couldn’t have your story.

??	And so you killed her.

??	Except I didn’t kill her.

??	And the only way you could’ve known about Rick is that you were there.

??	That’s not what the cops know. What do the cops know?

??	Well, they just recently received an e-mail from your account...

??	with a very graphic photo of Marissa’s death.

??	Her actual death.

??	Her gasping her last breath.

??	Her eyes wide open in terror.

??	Throat constricted.

??	Except the cops have my computer in custody.

??	So whoever hacked into my account will have left a computer trail to their own.

??	Do you really want to know why I put you on that story?

??	I already know.

??	It’s because you knew that I would figure it out.

??	You knew I’d get in so deep that you thought you could frame me...

??	for Marissa’s murder and I’d go down.

??	Because you knew if you didn’t put me on the Murder Club,

??	I’d find out about the tests, and you’d go down instead.

??	Well, guess what, Sam. You’re going down.

??	Because no matter what happens to me, I’m gonna make sure I take you with me.

??	Are you okay?

??	What are you doing here?

??	I’m here for you.

??	How did you know?

??	I couldn’t find you anywhere else. 

??	I knew they were setting you up. I came here to talk Sam out of it.

??	Why? For this.

??	You saved my life.

??	I should go.

??	I wasn’t talking about with Sam.

??	You make me love my work like I haven’t been proud of in a long time.

??	I do that?

??	You believe in me.

??	That counts for a lot.

??	When Detective Ross gave me my computer back,

??	I went through it and realized how toxic my writing had become when I was with Sam.

??	And then I found our interviews,and everything you said  made me smile.

??	I was talking about biology.

??	You were talking to me,

??	like I wasn’t just some pit bullgoing after a story.

??	You’ve never been that to me.  Not since the first time I saw you.

??	I didn’t know that then.

??	But I see it now.

??	So thank you for talking to the real me.

??	Are you real,

??	or just some figment of my imagination?

??	I don’t know. How good of a storyteller are you?

??	I’ll leave the stories up to you.  I just want this.
