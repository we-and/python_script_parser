GOTTI	Let me tell you somethin’. New York is the greatest fuckin’ city in the world. 

GOTTI	My city. 

GOTTI	I was a kid in the streets. I started in the fuckin’ gutter, 

GOTTI	and I made it to the top. 

GOTTI	This life ends one of two ways, dead or in jail. 

GOTTI	I did both.

GOTTI	I made my bones doin’ a piece of work for Don Carlo Gambino.

NEIL	I don’t need to tell you what happened. You know. 

NEIL	But the commission is moving. 

NEIL	The families will not allow this type of crime to go unchecked.

NEIL	Carlo paid the kidnappers, he complied with their every demand. 

NEIL	And how did they respond? 

NEIL	By leaving the kid in a fuckin’ dumpster.

NEIL	Now, each of the families is organizing a team 

NEIL	to head the hunt for the kidnappers.

NEIL	But as far as I’m concerned, this is a Gambino matter 

NEIL	and we will not fuckin’ stand down. This is our responsibility. 

NEIL	So John, I want you to head the Gambino team. 

NEIL	We are not only doing this for Carlo, we’re going this for the whole family.

GOTTI	I understand.

CARLO GAMBINO	I want you to take care of this for me.

GOTTI	It would be an honor. Consider it done.

McBRATNEY	Ah, Jesus Christ, you look at these fuckin’ bums?

McBRATNEY	Missy, hit me again, will ya?

BARMAID	Whisky neat. Coming right up.

BOBBY	James McBratney? You’re under arrest.

McBRATNEY		I guess somebody better call the cops then, huh?

GOTTI	Let’s go.

GOTTI	Motherfucker! Hey! Down. 

GOTTI	You have to add a successful hit under my belt, 

GOTTI	Carlo Gambino opened up the books for the first time since 1957.

GOTTI	And like that, I became a made man.

GOTTI	Can you believe the way they bring me in here? 

GOTTI	Like I’m Hannibal the fucking Cannibal or something.

GOTTI	I got the trifecta.

GOTTI	I got jaw, neck and throat. 

GOTTI	They took my tit and they put it on my face. 

GOTTI	I only do one-armed pushups ‘cause they took the whole chest muscle out.

JOHN A.	Those fucking butchers.

GOTTI	Yeah.

GOTTI	My body betrayed me, John, but not my mind, and not my heart.

GOTTI	That’ll never happen. I’m still here, John, 

GOTTI	I’m still motherfuckin’ these guys at every turn.

GOTTI	So, what’s up?

JOHN A.	They ordered me a visit.

JOHN A.	I thought at least I’d maybe get a phone call, but the judge insisted I get the visit.

GOTTI	John, they didn’t do this out of the kindness of their hearts. 

GOTTI	So, I’m gonna ask you again. What’s up?

JOHN A.	I’m thinking about taking a plea. 

GOTTI	A plea? 

GOTTI	And what are their expectations of you in this plea?

JOHN A.	Five and a half to 7 years.

GOTTI	Five and a half or 7? Which is it?

GOTTI	I don’t want you should stay in prison one motherfucking more day.

GOTTI	I would rather have this cancer than you have a cold, 

GOTTI	but, if I robbed a church and I had the steeple sticking out of my ass,

GOTTI	I would deny it.

JOHN A.	I know, Dad. I know that...

GOTTI	Okay, so I’m telling you as a father, not as a boss but as a father,

GOTTI	if you say that you’re innocent, I believe you. 

GOTTI	So why would you stand up in front of the motherfuckers and say that you’re guilty?

GOTTI	Why would you do that?

JOHN A.	Because if I take this plea, it’s over. 

JOHN A.	They’re not gonna keep coming after me with more charges. I get closure.

GOTTI	Closure.

GOTTI	Lemme make sure I heard that straight. “Closure." 

GOTTI	What kind of a mealy mouth word is that? 

GOTTI	This is a word for 

GOTTI	over-educated, under intelligent motherfuckers. 

GOTTI	It’s not a word that’s in my vocabulary.

JOHN A.	My boys are still young kids.

JOHN A.	If I take this plea, I’m back with them before they’re teenagers. 

JOHN A.	If I lose at trial, I’m doing 20 years. Like they never had a father.

VICTORIA	She’s a nice woman.

GOTTI	She’s a nice woman now ‘cause she’s dying of cancer. 

GOTTI	Two weeks ago everybody hated her, now she’s “Miss Popularity”.

GOTTI	I’m just, I’m just sayin’.

GOTTI	When’s Halloween?

VICTORIA	Next week.

GOTTI	Next week, this week, what do I know? Every day is Halloween in this place. 

GOTTI	What are you gonna be?

LITTLE JOHN A.	Officer Mike down the block’s gonna let me use his policeman’s hat. 

LITTLE JOHN A.	I’m going as a cop.

GOTTI	What’s the matter with you?

VICTORIA	With me?

GOTTI	-What are you doing to my son?

VICTORIA	Oh, so now he’s your son alone?

VICTORIA	Because of you I’m alone.

GOTTI	Let me tell you somethin’. 

GOTTI	No kid of mine is gonna be a cop for Halloween, and that’s it. It’s not gonna happen.

VICTORIA	He’s just a kid. Today he wants to be a cop, tomorrow an astronaut.

GOTTI	If I ever hear that you let my son or any of my kids or you for that matter, 

GOTTI	talk to that cop or any cop, I’ll kill you.

VICTORIA	Relax, he’s just being nice to your son.

GOTTI	Don’t make me repeat myself, Victoria, 

GOTTI	And you don’t dress like a cop, 

GOTTI	you don’t act like a cop, and you don’t talk like a cop. You understand me? 

GOTTI	What the matter with you?

VICTORIA	Me? What’s the matter with you?

GOTTI	Don’t start Victoria. I’m not in the mood. Don’t talk to me like that.

VICTORIA	You think you’re such a tough guy. Do you know what you’re doing to this family? And you’re gonna kill me? 
VICTORIA	I’d like to see you try.

GOTTI	Don’t get smart with me.

GOTTI	What do you wanna be? 

GOTTI	Why don’t you ask him? What do you wanna be?

LITTLE JOHN A.	A baseball player?

GOTTI	No. You don’t wanna be a baseball player. 

GOTTI	Why don’t you be “Casper the Ghost”. 

GOTTI	You put a sheet over and make the holes...

VICTORIA	Casper’s for 5 years old.

GOTTI	What was you? What was you last year? You were a princess, right?

GOTTI	And what was you? You were a...

GUARD 1	Time’s up, Gotti.

GOTTI	Gotta go.
	
VICTORIA	I love yous.

GOTTI	I love you too.

GOTTI	After being I.D.’d by the barmaid, they sent me to Green Haven Penitentiary.

GOTTI	where I served 2 years out of a 4 year sentence.

GOTTI	With the guards in my back pocket 

GOTTI	I was able to get medical furloughs to see the family dentist.

DENTIST	Not a cavity in sight, Mr. Gotti. We’ll see you next time.

GOTTI	And while I was at it, I was able to clean up some unfinished McBratney business.

GOTTI	Remember what I used to tell yous guys?

GOTTI	Me, Angelo and Frankie, we’d say we was goin’ out of town and that we were 

GOTTI	at a construction job, we was gonna build this big wall

GOTTI	and that was gonna take 3 years. 

GOTTI	Remember?

JOHN A.	Yeah.

GOTTI	I know that, Dad, I know.

JOHN A.	John, I want what’s best for you and your family.

GOTTI	And the idea of just one day of you being in prison makes me sick. 

GOTTI	But I don’t know what makes me sicker, you being in prison, 

GOTTI	or you bowing to these pieces of shit.

JOHN A.	What bowing? There’s no bowing, it’s a compromise. 

JOHN A.	They get their pound of flesh, I get my piece of mind.

JOHN A.	That one day I’ll be there for my family when I am needed.

JOHN A.	That’s what this is.

GOTTI	How could you be so naive? 

GOTTI	Once they get you in, you will never be free again. Do you understand that? 

GOTTI	They say you win this time, but next time they’ll make sure that you don’t.

JOHN A.	There won’t be a next time. I’ve always felt in my heart 

JOHN A.	that the day would come when my family and I’d get separated by prison.

JOHN A.	I’m just thankful it isn’t for life. And this plea will insure that.

GOTTI	I had high hopes for Johnny Boy. Me? I was born with four fuckin’ cents to my name.

GOTTI	And now I got a kid going to the New York Military Academy.

GOTTI	Johnny Boy, come on. Let’s go. We ain’t got all day.

GOTTI	What’s the matter? You guys look like your brother’s going to the electric chair. Cheer up. 
	
GOTTI	Why don’t you go get some ice-cream 

GOTTI	pizzas or something.

PETER	I don’t like ice-cream.

GOTTI	Get Fudge Sticks, you love them.

FRANKIE	I don’t like pizza either.

GOTTI	How ‘bout the movies? What’s that movie you like so much? 

GOTTI	About spaghetti. “Meatballs” or something. Go see that.

GOTTI	Come on. We ain’t got all day!

JOHN A.	Alright guys.

JOHN A.	C’me here.

JOHN A.	You guys better not get into any trouble while I’m gone.

JOHN A.	Look out for your brother, alright?

GOTTI	Alright. Enough. Enough. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go.

VICTORIA	Wait, wait.

JOHN A.	Ma! Please! 

JOHN A.	I gotta go.

VICTORIA	I made you some tuna sandwich for the road.

GOTTI	You know what? You’re gonna see him this weekend.

GOTTI	At my house, more often than not, 

GOTTI	was Angelo Ruggiero my best friend since we was kids.

VICTORIA	Hey, Ange.

ANGELO	Hey, Vic. 

ANGELO	He up yet?

VICTORIA	You talk to him. I’ve tried.

PETER	Hey, Uncle Ange.

ANGELO	Hey. Woa. You know what’s good for you, don’t let your dad see that cop car.

GOTTI	Come on, you fucking prick. Come on, co–

GOTTI	Look at this. Come on. Ah, co--

GOTTI	Oh, motherfucker!

ANGELO	You know what fuckin’ time it is?

GOTTI	Did you see that? Did you see that? 

GOTTI	I bet 6 dimes on Buffalo, they’re killin’ us, 10 to nothin’.

GOTTI	I put 6x dimes on New England, they are killin’ us.

GOTTI	I put 6 dimes on Chicago, they are losin’. 

GOTTI	And now I put three dimes on Kansas City. 

GOTTI	They are winning, but they’ll fucking blow it. Motherfuckers!

ANGELO	You should hang yourself, leave your troubles behind.
	
GOTTI	Smart ass. You wouldn’t believe how much I lost last week.

ANGELO	Don’t wanna believe. Don’t wanna know.

GOTTI	Just once, I’d give my fuckin’ life, just that to have the Redskins win once.

ANGELO	I got a Redskin named Willie Boy in the car.

GOTTI	I gotta clean up. Motherfuckers!

FRANKIE	Uncle Ange, look.

ANGELO	Whatcha got there, Frankie?

ANGELO	Oh! No, you didn’t. You straight A’s? I’ve never seen anything like this.

GOTTI	Frankie Boy, you show Uncle Ange your report card? 

GOTTI	Can you believe it? My son’s a godamn genius.

VICTORIA	My Frankie’s gonna be a rocket scientist. What do you think about that, Ange?

GOTTI	Let’s go. I won’t be home for dinner.

VICTORIA	It’s Sunday night.

GOTTI	I gotta repeat myself? I’m not comin’ home for dinner!

VICTORIA	Johnny, it’s family night!

GOTTI	I’ll make it up to yous.

VICTORIA	Put a little ice on it.

JOHN A.	Ma, I’m... Ma!

VICTORIA	Okay. I’ll fix you something to eat.

GOTTI	Get your feet off the couch. Get up.

GOTTI	You got suspended, huh? What do you think you’re doing?

JOHN A.	These local kids jumped a couple of our guys. 

JOHN A.	We’re just handling our business.

GOTTI	You’re handling your business?

JOHN A.	Yeah. I guess.

GOTTI	You guess. 

GOTTI	You show up?

GOTTI	Never back off. You always stand up. You fight till you can’t fight no more. 

GOTTI	Never take a backwards step, ever.

JOHN A.	Dad, I ’m thinking maybe I don’t wanna try for West Point anymore.

JOHN A.	Maybe take a year off.

GOTTI	Take a year off? Drop out of school. Not go to college. 

GOTTI	Become a bum on the streets? Is that what you want?

GOTTI	Huh? What are you thinking?

GOTTI	You wanna hang out with me? Is that what you’re thinking? Jesus Christ. 

GOTTI	Butch. I’m hungry!

GOTTI	They get it if they’re good. 

GOTTI	It’s just like if they’re good they get what they get paid. 

GOTTI	Like, a lot of ‘em are bums.

NEIL	That’s for sure.

GOTTI	The Lucchese’s here.

GOTTI	I don’t like that guy.

NEIL	Which one?

GOTTI	His name’s Gaspipe.

NEIL	Oh, yeah. I heard of him.

GOTTI	He’s trouble. 

GOTTI	He’s up in Angelo’s face about them apartment on 59th Street. 

GOTTI	I hear he’s a real sicko.

GOTTI	Look at him. He’s making sure all the Families know his name. 

GOTTI	The prick.

NEIL	Relax. He’s not our business.

NEIL	Sweetheart. Can we get another round here, please?
	
WAITRESS	You got it.

GOTTI	Let me ask you something.

GOTTI	What do you think the Genovese’s capos think of the boss?

NEIL	What are you talking about?

GOTTI	I understand the whole insanity plea, 

GOTI	but running around town in the fucking pajamas, give me a fucking break.

GOTTI	Vincent the Chin Gigante.

GOTTI	According to the government, the powerful boss of the Genovese crime family. 

GOTTI	To me, he was a rival.

NEIL	Chin is a very smart guy. 

NEIL	He runs his family as he sees fit. I can tell you this.

NEIL	You would never see Chin and his crew in a place like this. That’s for fucking sure.

GOTTI	Well, talking about bosses who hide

NEIL	Don’t start.

GOTTI	I’m just telling you he’s not here. He’s never here. 

GOTTI	How can you run a family if you’re not on the ground with them.

NEIL	Jonhny, you have got to shut the fuck up. Paul is your boss. 

NEIL	End of fuckin’ story.

GOTTI	Who’s this? Who’s that guy with Frankie? What’s his name again?

NEIL	That’s Sammy Bull.

GOTTI	That’s Sammy. Why Bull?

NEIL	Bulls Head Staten Island.

GOTTI	I know about him.

NEIL	You don’t like anybody here tonight.

GOTTI	I just don’t like what I hear about him, okay? That’s all I’m saying.

NEIL	He’s a good earner and he’s Frankie’s guy.

GOTTI	He ain’t never done time. And I don’t trust anybody who’s never done time.

NEIL	Well, he’s our friend now. And you trust Frankie, don’t you?

NEIL	Frankie would vouch to the fucking moon for this kid. 

NEIL	We gotta give him a chance.

GOTTI	Here they come.

DeCICCO	Hi boys. How you doing tonight? Hey, Johnnie.

SAMMY	How you doing, Neil?

NEIL	How are you, Sammy?

DeCICCO	Sammy, I’d like you to meet a good friend of ours and a dear friend of mine, John Gotti.

SAMMY	How you doing, John? Heard a lot about you from Frankie. 

SAMMY	Glad to finally meet.

GOTTI	All good, I hope.

DeCICCO	Of course it’s good. How am I gonna talk about my brother?

GOTTI	Time in Lewisburg will make a man out of you. Am I right, Frankie? 

GOTTI	You come out of there ticker than thieves.

GOTTI	Right?

DeCICCO	My fuckin’ brother, Johnny.

NEIL	Let’s raise the glass to our new friend.

SAMMY	Salud, guys.

DeCICCO	Salud. 


DeCICCO	Neil.

NEIL	Frankie.

GOTTI	You trust this kid?

SAMMY	Thank you.

GOTTI	John.

GOTTI	We walk together and we fall together. 

GOTTI	This is the Life. I chose my side over 40 years ago.

JOHN A.	The hardest thing in this world for me to do would be to have to say goodbye to my kids. 

JOHN A.	I can’t do it.

GOTTI	I don’t want you to. 

GOTTI	I don’t want to have to lie to your kids and you telling ‘em you are on some construction job. 

GOTTI	You and me John, we never had to lie to each other.

GOTTI	But the lies you tell yourself, these are the lies you gotta live with.

GOTTI	And missing your kids? You think that’s bad? 

GOTTI	Do I really have to say it? Do I?

GOTTI	Frankie.

FRANKIE	No, leave the light on.

VICTORIA	Frankie, we’re just down the hall.

GOTTI	Let him leave it on. Kids are scared of the dark.

FRANKIE	Just till John gets back?

GOTTI	Till John gets back.

GOTTI	G’night, Frankie. Love you. See you tomorrow.

VICTORIA	Love you.

VICTORIA	Oh, my god! Oh! Frankie! Frankie!

VICTORIA	Frankie! Mommy’s here. 

JOHN FAVARA	I didn’t see him. Look. The sun was in my eyes.

VICTORIA	Mommy’s here. Stay awake.

GOTTI	Johnny Boy, it was an accident. 

GOTTI	It was an accident. It happened. He’s gone. 

GOTTI	But he’ll always be your brother. Now you listen to me.

GOTTI	I want you to be strong, okay?

GOTTI	I’m proud of you.

GOTTI	Now, we gotta do this for your mother. Come on. Come on.

VICTORIA	Come here. Come here. Come here.

VICTORIA	Come here.

VICTORIA	He’s cold. Frankie...

GOTTI	What are you doing? Come here.

VICTORIA	Frankie Boy is cold.

VICTORIA	I have to bring him a blanket!

GOTTI	Come here.

VICTORIA	Johnny, nooo!

GOTTI	Come here. It’s gonna be fine.

GOTTI	Calm down, Vicky, calm down.

VICTORIA	I need to go to see my baby.

GOTTI	You need to calm down.

VICTORIA	Listen to me. I need to go.

GOTTI	Okay.

VICTORIA	I need to bring a blanket for him.

WILLIE BOY	What happened? Is Vicky okay?

BOBBY	This piece of shit Favara. She smacked him around with a baseball bat.

GOTTI	She’s gonna be alright.

BOBBY	He’s a stupid fucking asshole, John. 

BOBBY	He never fixed the dent in their car. 

BOBBY	He leaves it in the driveway, day after day for Vicky to see.

WILLIE BOY	John. We can’t know why God lets these things happen, but,

WILLIE BOY	there has to be a reason...

GOTTI	A reason? For these things? 

GOTTI	He was 12 years old, he didn’t even have hair on his prick. 

GOTTI	There ain’t no fuckin’ reason. There ain’t no fuckin’ God! 

GOTTI	Don’t say another word. 

GOTTI	I might take Vicky down to Florida to see her family. 

GOTTI	I think it’d be good for us to clear our head.

JOHN MILLER	On March 12, 1980,

JOHN MILLER	12 year old Frank Gotti was riding his mini-bike 

JOHN MILLER	on this street, 157 Avenue, just three blocks from his home. 

JOHN MILLER	John Favara’s car hit 12 year old Frank Gotti and killed him.

JOHN MILLER	People who know the Gottis say they never came to terms with young Frank’s death. 

JOHN MILLER	Police, however, believe that someone did come to terms with John Favara. 
JOHN MILLER	On July 28th, Favara left his job and walked to his car

JOHN MILLER	which was parked next door at the Capitol Diner.

JOHN MILLER	The diner’s owner told police 

JOHN MILLER	he saw three men club Favara and shoved him into a van. 

JOHN MILLER	The best witness police had in the abduction of John Favara was Leon Papon, 

JOHN MILLER	the man who owned the diner. He’d seen the whole thing. 

JOHN MILLER	He told that to Nassau County Police,

JOHN MILLER	But then the assailants returned to the diner several days later,

JOHN MILLER	they reportedly ordered coffee and as they sipped it, they stared at Papon. 

JOHN MILLER	Right after that Papon stopped cooperating with Nassau County detectives. 

JOHN MILLER	His memory of the incident faded, he sold the diner and moved away.

GOTTI	Okay, that’s it. That’s it.

GOTTI	That’s it. That’s it. That’s it.

GOTTI	Vicky. Enough.

GOTTI	I love you, but we got 4 other kids.

GOTTI	We will never let go of Frankie, you understand me? Never. 

GOTTI	He’s in our hearts forever. Forever. 

GOTTI	Till the day we die. 

GOTTI	We’re gonna always live like we’re seven. 

GOTTI	I’m gonna make you some coffee.

JOHN A.	Here. No problem. Merry Christmas.

GOTTI	Look at him. That lousy bastard of my father

GOTTI	turnes out to be a good grandpa. Who knew?

VICTORIA	You never know.

GOTTI	Maybe if we didn’t have such crappy parents, we wouldn’t have so much in common. 

GOTTI	You know what I’m sayin’?

VICTORIA	Yeah, I’d be living in Flatbush married to a dentist.

GOTTI	What are you talking about? You got a bad tooth 

GOTTI	I’ll be happy to knock it right out of your mouth. 

GOTTI	There’s my smile. There’s my girl.

GOTTI	Bet you didn’t think you’d be serving 100 people in this house.

VICTORIA	Yeah, one day a year I can handle it. 

GOTTI	Yeah?

VICTORIA	Can you believe it? We used to barely have enough for the two of us.

GOTTI	But we had each other, that’s all that matters. 

GOTTI	That’s all that matters. 

GOTTI	You and me we’ll get through this together. We’ll get through anything.

NEIL	Heeey! Merry Christmas.

ANGELO	Merry Christmas.

GOTTI	I’ve been meaning to ask you. Who is that guy sitting in my chair?

VICTORIA	You’ve been meaning to ask? 

VICTORIA	That guy’s been in your chair every Christmas for the last 15 years.

GOTTI	What can I get you to drink?

NEIL	How about a cigar?

GOTTI	Let’s do it.

NEIL	Yeah. Let’s do it.

GOTTI	Sammy Gravano told me something.

NEIL	What did he say?

GOTTI	That you was over at Paul’s house just now.

NEIL	Yeah, I was at Paul’s house just now.

GOTTI	Did you see Sammy there?

NEIL	No. I just stopped by for two minutes.

GOTTI	He told Paul “I wanna go see Neil to wish him Merry Christmas”. 

NEIL	Why do I give a shit about all this?

GOTTI	Because Paul said “What you wanna do that for? You’re on our side.”

NEIL	And what did Sammy say to that?

GOTTI	He said “We’re all a family, ain’t we?”

GOTTI	“And Neil’s the underboss.”

NEIL	Sammy told you that?

GOTTI	Sammy told me.

BOBBY	Hey! What’s happening? I told you r sister that

BOBBY	you need a woman.

GOTTI	Now, I know. What I didn’t know before, now I know.

PAUL	What’s wrong with you?

GOTTI	Paul Castellano was a fucking fish in the desert. 

GOTTI	A fish out of water. I never respected Paul. 

GOTTI	As an underboss Neil was more of a boss than Paul ever was.

PAUL	Give my regards to Victoria.

GOTTI	I will, thanks. 


GOTTI	She’ll be glad to hear it.

GOTTI	If Paul goes to prison for them indictments, they gonna make Tommy Bilotti street boss.

NEIL	Happy days. We can all go into the wig business.

GOTTI	Neil, what’s going on here? 

NEIL	Keepin’ Paul in silk pajamas.

GOTTI	He’s more concerned making deals with other families than his own borgata.

NEIL	He’s the boss! End of fuckin’ story.

GOTTI	TIME magazine says you’re the boss.

NEIL	Shows you what a disreputable fucking profession that is.

GOTTI	Let me tell you why. 

NEIL	I’ll tell you why. 

NEIL	Because we’ve never been under this kind of scrutiny before.

GOTTI	No. They can see you, Neil.

NEIL	Yeah, too fuckin’ much evidently.

GOTTI	No. You can see, you can talk man to man with you. 

GOTTI	You know what I’m saying? I mean what’s Paul’s contribution to society?

GOTTI	Fuckin’ his Portuguese maid.

NEIL	As long as it keeps him off of my back.

GOTTI	But, 35 years in the same house as his wife, I mean, that ain’t right. 

GOTTI	That ain’t right.

NEIL	Guess you gotta give him credit.

GOTTI	Credit for what? His penile implant?

NEIL	You got his house bugged, do you?

GOTTI	Yeah, I defeated that 50,000 dollar security system with my good looks. 
GOTTI	That Portuguese maid was crazy about me.

NEIL	She’s Guatemalan, but you know so fucking much.

GOTTI	Did you ever see her? Wherever country she’s from, they probably made her leave. 

GOTTI	I wouldn’t fuck her with your dick.

NEIL	Listen, Paul’s got diabetes. What’re you gonna do? Huh? 
	
NEIL	It’s not a subject I feel, comfortable discussing. 

NEIL	What the fuck is so fucking funny?

BOBBY	I’m sorry.

NEIL	He’s hysterical, we’re gonna have a fucking accident.

GOTTI	He’s laughing because I wouldn’t fuck her with his dick.

RUDY PIPES	Look at this place. What a dump.

JOHNNY R.	What are we doing here?

JOHN A.	We’ll get a couple of drinks and go get somethin’ to eat. 
	
RUDY PIPES	I’m goin’ to Little Pete’s. He’s got these shrimp like this.

JOHN A.	That’s a cop joint.

JOHNNY R.	This guy don’t stop eatin’ shrimp.

ELFIE	How about a round of shots on me?

JOHN A.	No, we’re good. Thanks.

RUDY	What do you mean? 

JOHN A.	I went there the other week.

ELFIE	Come on, one shot.

JOHNNY R.	Do me a favor, take a walk you and your fuckin’ mustache, please.

ELFIE	Bartender, shots for me and my boys here. 

JOHN A.	We’re good. Thank you.

JOHN A.	Cheers. Salud.

ELFIE	You’re too good to have a shot with me?

JOHN A.	I said take a fuckin’ walk!

RUDY	Here you are motherfucker! 

JOHN A.	You, fuckin’ asshole! Motherfucker!

RUDY	You, motherfuckin’ piece of shit! I’m gonna beat you, fuckin’ motherfucker!

JOHN A.	You want some?

JOHNNY R.	Come on, John!

JOHNNY R.	John come on. Come on. Let’s get the fuck out!

RUDY	What the fuck?

JOHNNY R.	I was swinging with everything, man. I didn’t give a fuck. 

JOHNNY R. 	When he came in I grabbed the barstool.

JOHN A.	I saw you do that.

JOHNNY R.	I didn’t give a fuck. I just kept goin’.

JOHN A.	I was swinging. I didn’t even know who I was hitting.

JOHNNY R.	You swang at the wrong guy 3 times.

JOHN A.	No, I didn’t.

JOHNNY R.	You kiddin’ me? You hit the wrong kid. He wasn’t even with them. He was with the other kids.

GOTTI	You, little motherfucker!

GOTTI	Did you have a fight tonight? Did you?

JOHN A.	Yeah.

GOTTI	Someone got killed! Did you know that?

JOHN A.	No, I didn’t know that.

JOHNNY R.	No one got killed.
	
GOTTI	You shut the fuck up! 

GOTTI	You, cocksuckers! You ‘re gonna ruin your future!

GOTTI	Don’t you understand? 


GOTTI	This is gonna follow you for the rest of your fuckin’ life!

JOHN A.	Someone got killed?

JOHNNY R.	Not when I was there.

ANGELO	Proudest moment of his life was watching you graduate from military school, and now this? 

ANGELO	Your father’s crushed. You know that?

JOHN A.	I know.

ANGELO	No. You do not know anything!

JOHNNY R.	Dad, we didn’t...

ANGELO	Just shut up. I’ll talk to you later. 

ANGELO	The sharks are circling. 

ANGELO	Cops are gonna shake him down. And that man’s gonna pay to protect you!
JOHN A.	I didn’t kill the guy. I’ll answer for it. Anything! We didn’t kill anybody.

ANGELO	I know that. But it doesn’t fuckin’ matter. 

ANGELO	You two stupid motherfuckers. You brought a lot of fuckin’ heat down on this family.

GOTTI	Actually, it was Angelo who brought the heat down on the family 

GOTTI	when the government released what would become known as

GOTTI	“The Angelo Ruggiero Tapes”. 

GOTTI	They picked up Ange on a wire tap 

GOTTI	talking about various activities that neither Paul 

GOTTI	or the government would have sanctioned. Fucking Ange.

ANGELO	This is ridiculous! 

NEIL	You got popped, Ange.

GOTTI	Let me just ask you one question. 

GOTTI	Are you badmouthing Paul on the tapes? 

GOTTI	Are you?

ANGELO	I don’t know. 

ANGELO	There’s hundreds of hours, John!

GOTTI	What? You don’t remember nothing?

ANGELO	They bugged my daughter’s phone!

GOTTI	What were you sayin’ in the tapes?

ANGELO	I said a lotta things that could get a lotta people in a lotta troubles.

ANGELO	My friends, our friends are on those tapes.

GOTTI	Neil, okay. If Angelo decides that

GOTTI	he doesn’t wanna turn these tapes over to Paul, what happens?

GOTTI	Is that it?

NEIL	No. That is most definitely not fucking it.

NEIL	If Paul wants the tapes, we gotta get him the tapes, he’s the boss. 

NEIL	Boss is the boss, is the boss, that’s “La Cosa Nostra.”

GOTTI	Don’t tell me that I don’t know it’s about La Cosa Nostra.

ANGELO	If it was just some fuckin’ asshole gettin’ called out, or some Joe, 

ANGELO	I would authorize the handover in a second. 

ANGELO	But this is our friends.

NEIL	Now, look.

NEIL	If the government has a case, 

NEIL	Paul will find out when it comes to trial because it’ll be a matter of public record. 

NEIL	You’re fucked either way.

ANGELO	We are fucked. 

ANGELO	Okay. We’re fucked either way.

NEIL	No. That’s not gonna happen. Get it out of your head right now.

ANGELO	Yeah. Hey, John, listen. 

ANGELO	You know that Paul doesn’t give two fucks about me or you. 

ANGELO	He’s shitting bricks over his own fuckin’ case.

GOTTI	You don’t know what you’re talkin’ about.

GOTTI	Just, just shut the fuck up, will ya? You got us into this mess. 

NEIL	Get the fuck outta here, Ange. Go on.

NEIL	Christ Almighty. 

NEIL	I ain’t sayin’ you’re wrong, but what do you want me to tell Paul? 

NEIL	Ange sayin’ to the boss “Fuck you, I don’t wanna hand over those fuckin’ tapes.” 

NEIL	I’ve been trying to make this thing go away, but, 

NEIL	Paul keeps bringing it up. 

NEIL	Unless I say to him “Fuck you, go fuck yourself.” 

NEIL	And you know what we gotta do then, hm? 

NEIL	We roll ‘em up and we go to war.

GOTTI	We gotta do what we gotta do. We strike him before he gets us.

GOTTI	What? What’s the matter? You okay?

NEIL	Yeah, no...

GOTTI	What do you need?

NEIL	It’s just, it’ll pass.

NEIL	It’s funny. All these fuckin’ tapes, and trials and we 

NEIL	spend all this time tryin’ to stay one step ahead of the game,

NEIL	but this fuckin’ cancer, 

NEIL	that is the ultimate “fuck you”.

BOBBY	If I didn’t have bad luck I’d have no luck at all.

BOBBY	Ah, beautiful!

BOBBY	You got somethin’ for me?

BOBBY	See this kid here? 

BOBBY	I used to give him five dollars to go to the candy store. 

BOBBY	Now, look at him, he’s a fuckin’ earner.

BOBBY	Here. Buy yourself a new sport jacket, 

BOBBY	‘cause we are going to Regine’s tonight. Tonight. Tonight.

WILLIE BOY	Let me tell you something about your old man. 

WILLIE BOY	When he was sent up to Green Haven on the McBratney thing, as you probably know about, 

WILLIE BOY	Carlo Gambino was so grateful to your father 

WILLIE BOY	for his service to him,

WILLIE BOY	he got him Roy Cohn to defend him. 

WILLIE BOY	Roy Cohn, biggest fuckin’ lawyer in the country.

WILLIE BOY	Your dad wasn’t even a “made man” at the time.

WILLIE BOY	Cohn makes a deal on a plea, gets it reduced to involuntary manslaughter. 

WILLIE BOY	Your dad’s out in four. 

WILLIE BOY	What a lot of people don’t know about

WILLIE BOY	Is how your daddy came to be arrested in the first place. 

WILLIE BOY	Your dad was lyin’ low, and he hears 

WILLIE B OY	I have this problem with the Genovese Family.

WILLIE BOY	He showed up, 

WILLIE BOY	interceded on my behalf at a sit down in Masbeth.

WILLIE BOY	And the FBI picked him up on a tip-off as he was leaving.

WILLIE BOY	Loyalty cuts both ways with him.

LADY PROSECUTOR	Your Honor, the Prosecution contends that Mr. Gotti is a clear

LADY PROSECUTOR	and continuing danger to the community, 

LADY PROSECUTOR	and in lieu of a potential life sentence in this case, 

LADY PROSECUTOR	it would be imprudent to grant him bail.

JUDGE	Thank you, Miss Giacalone, 

JUDGE	but you have not convinced me that Mr. Gotti is a flight risk. 

JUDGE	The court grants bail in the amount of 1 million dollars.

WILLIE BOY’S ATTORNEY	Your Honor, as the court has granted bail for Mr. Gotti, 

WILLIE BOY’S ATTORNEY	we also request bail be set at a reasonable amount for Mr. Johnson.

LADY PROSECUTOR	Your Honor, we have strong reason to believe

LADY PROSECUTOR	that this defendant’s life will be in serious jeopardy if he is granted bail.

JUDGE	And why would that be?

LADY PROSECUTOR	Because Wilfred Johnson has been a confidential informant 

LADY PROSECUTOR	for the FBI for the past 19 years.

WILLIE BOY	That is a lie! Gotti! They’re lyin’! She’s lyin’. 

WILLIE BOY	You’re lyin’! You’re gonna get me killed!

JUDGE	Order! We will have order. Counselor, restrain your client.

JUDGE	In light of that information, if confirmed, bail is denied on Johnson.

WILLIE BOY	If I stand strong...

WILLIE BOY	I refuse to testify, and we win,

WILLIE BOY	can I get a pass? I’m begging you... 

WILLIE BOY	Swear it. 

WILLIE B OY	Swear it on your kid’s grave you won’t kill me.

GOTTI	How am I gonna kill a ghost?

JUDGE	Do you have the verdict, please?

GOTTI	Me and Willy Boy Johnson beat a massive RICO case due to 

GOTTI	the lack of credibility of the government’s witness.
	
JURY FOREMAN	We find the defendants 

JURY FOREMAN	John Joseph Gotti and Wilfred Johnson not guilty.

GOTTI	As for Willie Boy, that’s another story.

GOTTI	Dominic’s been doing the fireworks for years.

BOBBY	Dominic ain’t got two fingers.

GOTTI	It’s my gift to them. So they can do the fireworks the way I like it. 

BOBBY	I’d get used to it. I love how they do them.
	
GOTTI	Look at this.

BOBBY	You wanna have some fun?

GOTTI	Let’s go have some fun.

GOTTI	Is there a problem here?

LIEUTENANT	We’re shutting you down. This is an unpermitted street gathering,

LIEUTENANT	and there are illegal fireworks on these premises.

BOBBY	What are you talkin’ about? We been doin’ this for 20 years.

GOTTI	You’re gonna put this good people in jail because they’re proud of their country? Is that right? 

GOTTI	You got my lawyer on the phone?

BOBBY	Standing by.

GOTTI	You got bail money?

BOBBY	With interest.

GOTTI	Send ‘em up!

LIEUTENANT	Next time, Gotti. Next time.

PEOPLE	Gotti! Gotti! Gotti! 

BOBBY	This is your town, John.

BOBBY	Look at this one. How good am I to you? Go ahead, taste.

BOBBY	Huh?

JOHN A.	-It’s t not bad. I know.

JOHN A.	Hey. Excuse me. 

JOHN A.	I don’t normally do this, but I saw you walkin’ over . 

JOHN A.	I’d hate myself the rest of my life if I didn’t come and talk to you.

KIM	Stop it. John. You’re not funny.

JOHN A.	Wait. Do we know each other?

KIM	You lose your memory at the military academy?

KIM	It’s me, Kim. Come on John, Joey Rugs daughter.

JOHN A.	I’m sorry. It’s just... you look different.

KIM	Guess I grew up.

JOHN A.	Yeah, I guess you did.

JOHN A.	You wanna get a beer or something?

KIM	John, I’m 16.

JOHN A.	Oh! You wanna get a soda?

KIM	Yeah. That sounds nice.

JOHN A.	Alright. Let’s go.

BOBBY	See ya both... Joey Rugs.

NEIL	Paul wants to see you. And I held him back as long as I can.

GOTTI	What the fuck. The Angelo tapes again?

NEIL	It’s got nothing to do with Angelo. Paul has decided to break up your crew.

GOTTI	He’s gonna break up the crew. What the fuck does that mean?

NEIL	If Paul goes to prison he wants to make sure that everybody knows he’s still the boss.

GOTTI	It’s like Carlo fuckin’ Gambino all over again. 

GOTTI	Everybody knows that it should have been you.

NEIL	What you want and what you get are two different things.

GOTTI	If he wants reassurance, forget about it.

NEIL	He will get it and you better agree with him or look like you do.

GOTTI	He doesn’t deserve it, Neil. Look, you gotta earn your merits like we did.

NEIL	What world are you livin’ in?

GOTTI	All fuckin’ Paul cares about is money. That’s his get-off. That’s it.

NEIL	Comin’ from a fuckin’ degenerate gambler.

GOTTI	You’re goddamn right. You can’t take it with you.

NEIL	Hm. Yeah. 

GOTTI	If Paul makes a move on Angelo...

NEIL	You will live with it if he gives you that choice.

GOTTI	There is no choice, there’s only what you do.

NEIL	Listen to me. You kill the Boss of Bosses...

GOTTI	I will defend my position.

NEIL	You will bring down hellfire.

GOTTI	I’ll do what I gotta do.

NEIL	Not as long as I’m alive.

NEIL	Jesus. I can’t... 

NEIL	I can’t get over Willie Boy. 

NEIL	Shows you life is full of surprises. 

NEIL	He’s been with you since Fulton-Rockaway Boys, huh?

NEIL	Bunch of punk kids with the balls to stick up one of my poker games. 

NEIL	Yeah, you never know. 

GOTTI	I know. He broke my fuckin’ heart.
	
NEIL	You give him a pass?

GOTTI	Yeah.

NEIL	Attack from the outside you can deal with, 

NEIL	but attack from the inside? You’re history.

NEIL	Once you take that first step, there’s no turning back. 

NEIL	You either succeed, or you’re lost in enemy territory. 

NEIL	And if you miss, you die.

NEIL	And all your friends will die.

NEIL	So you’ll need DeCicco.

NEIL	If he’s on board, Joe Piney will join you, he’ll take care of the oldtimers. 

NEIL	And Gallo will go along.

PASTOR	The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not want.

PASTOR	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:

PASTOR	He leadeth me beside the still waters: 

PASTOR	He restoreth my soul.

PASTOR	He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. 

PASTOR	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 

PASTOR	I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me: 

PASTOR	Thy rod and Thy staff...

PASTOR	Thou preparest a table before me in the 

PASTOR	presence of mine enemies;

PASTOR	Thou anointest my head with oil: my cup runneth over.

PASTOR	Surely goodness and mercy shall 

PASTOR	follow me all the days of my life: 

PASTOR	and I will dwell in the house of the Lord, forever. 

PASTOR	In the name of the Father, and the Son...

SAMMY	Obviously, Paul couldn’t make it, but he sends his prayers.

GOTTI	Let me tell ya somethin’. 

GOTTI	Neil could have taken the family from Paul any time he wanted.

GOTTI	Everybody knows that. 

GOTTI	Paul, up on that hill, 


GOTTI	you gotta kiss his ring like he was the Pope. Fuck Paul.

DeCICCO	I hear you. I’m with you.

NEIL	You’ll need DeCicco. 

NEIL	If he’s on board, then Joe Piney will join you. He’ll take care of the oldtimers.

NEIL	And Gallo will go along...

NEIL	D.B. is important because he will smooth out all the rough edges 

NEIL	and make sure that everybody knows it’s only business,

NEIL	but you’re gonna need the approval of the other Families.

NEIL	Frank and Sammy Bull will pay homage to Brooklyn. 

NEIL	The Luccheses won’t be a problem. You got Pescucci on your side,

NEIL	so the Bonnanos we’re not worried about. 

NEIL	Leave the Colombos to Angelo. 

NEIL	He’ll feel the pulse with Freddy DeVico and Benny Cans.

GOTTI	And that leaves the Chin.

NEIL	Chin. You think I’m a stickler for the rules?

NEIL	Chin will not be happy no matter what. But, he’ll be outnumbered, so... 

NEIL	for the sake of a peaceful transition he will have to accept.

GOTTI	I don’t know. Paul and the Chin are pretty tight. They got a lotta money on the street.

NEIL	Well, you’ll take care of that after. And use D.B. for that. 

NEIL	Nobody’s cutting in on Chin’s action. 

NEIL	On the contrary, with Paul out of the way, what’s Chin’s is Chin’s, free and clear. 

NEIL	I have no doubt the other Families will back you, 

NEIL	but only if you have the support of all five boroughs, 

NEIL	Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, 

NEIL	Staten Island, The Bronx. 

NEIL	And that’s a fist.

GOTTI	So, what it comes down to is what you wanna be. 

NEIL	And I’m askin’ you. You wanna be consigliere? You wanna be underboss? 

NEIL	Because we’re gonna do this thing, we’re gonna do it right. 

GOTTI	It’s gonna be La Cosa Nostra. La Cosa Nostra till I die.

DeCICCO	Underboss, John. 

DeCICCO	Paul’s set up a dinner next Thursday.

DeCICCO	Friends only. 

DeCICCO	To discuss the reorganization of the Family.

GOTTI	We’re on a piece of work. It’s a big job,

GOTTI	but there’s no two ways about it, it’s gotta be done. 

GOTTI	Give ‘em the coats and hats.

ANGELO	The hats is all anyone is gonna remember seeing.

BOBBY	We’re around the corner from the United Nations. They’ll think the fuckin’ Russians are comin’.

GOTTI	Listen up. Pay attention. 

GOTTI	We’re hittin’ Paul.

GOTTI	And anyone else who’s in the car with him.

GOTTI	It’s gonna take place at Sparks Steak House.

GOTTI	That’s up at 46th between 2nd and 3rd.

GOTTI	He’s got a 6 o’clock reservation. 

GOTTI	There’s gonna be a lot of last minute Christmas shoppers, but that’s perfect for us.

GOTTI	We’re gonna get in and out. Bzang.

GOTTI	Like the Pittsburgh Stealers.

GOTTI	So it’s kill or be killed. Let’s go.

DeCICCO	Jimmy.

JIMMY BROWN	How you doin’?

DeCICCO	Good. Good.

JIMMY BROWN	Can I have a bourbon and ice, please?

JIMMY BROWN	So, Frank, 

JIMMY BROWN	this business with the Gotti crew is very troublesome to Paul. 

JIMMY BROWN	I know you like John.

JIMMY BROWN	Hell I like John. But now that Neil’s out of the picture,

JIMMY BROWN	Paul just wants to shake up the whole administration. 

JIMMY BROWN	And he wants you to be comfortable with it.

JIMMY BROWN	Paul’s running a little late.

DeCICCO	Paul’s here.

DeCICCO	He’s not gonna make dinner.

DeCICCO	We gotta go.

ROGER GRIMSBY	The assassination of Paul Castellano 

ROGER GRIMSBY	has local and federal officials looking for the men who did it and for a motive. 

ROGER GRIMSBY	Finding either or both is extremely difficult given the secrecy of organized crime.

ROGER GRIMSBY	We may never know why Castellano was killed. 

ROGER GRIMSBY	Louis Young is standing by in Staten Island at the Castellano home to tell us more.

FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR	Mafia kingpin Paul “Big Paul” Castellano

JOHN A.	Uncle Ange.

JOHN A.	Where’s my father?

ANGELO	He’ll be here soon.

JOHN A.	Is everything okay?

ANGELO	He’s okay.

JOHN A.	Because I heard Paul 

MAN ON TV	It would be a terrible mistake to think that 

MAN ON NTV	this is a good time to go around shooting up people.

GOTTI	He’s on a jet. He’s over Iceland, and the stewardess comes up and says 

GOTTI	“My name is Pussy Galore.” 

GOTTI	He says “I must be dreaming.”

DeCICCO	Fellas.

DeCICCO	We don’t know who killed Paul and Tommy. 

DeCICCO	But we’re gonna find out,

DeCICCO	conduct our own investigation, get to the bottom of this.

DeCICCO	That being said, 

DeCICCO	our job now is to maintain continuity of leadership.

DeCICCO	Make sure nobody thinks this Family’s fallin’ apart here. 

DeCICCO	So... 

DeDICCO	I nominate...

DeCICCO	John Gotti.
ANGELO	I second the motion.

MAN	To the new boss!

DeCICCO	John!

MEN	Salud!

MAN	Congratulations, John.

SAMMY	How does it feel?

GOTTI	Like times have changed and it’s good.

SAMMY	I mean how does it feel to be here? This was Neal’s joint.

GOTTI	It feels right. It feels like it’s what he would have wanted. 

GOTTI	It feels ah... 

GOTTI	wherever he is, he’s watching us.

SAMMY	Yeah. 

SAMMY	And he ain’t the only one.

GOTTI	I want to talk to you about that.

GOTTI	Nick Vilante’s widow lives upstairs.

GOTTI	We can’t kick her out on the street, but, 

GOTTI	if we have a serious conversation, or it’s raining, or it’s snowing,

GOTTI	we give her a little something, 

GOTTI	she vacates the premises for 20 minutes and then 

GOTTI	we take care of it.

SAMMY	I wish some of these guys would take a walk.
GOTTI	Let ‘em know. Let everybody know. 

GOTTI	Now everybody comes to me. To me.

GOTTI	You know what I’m sayin’? Oh, geez, everybody was there.
GOTTI	There was goodfellas there and there was non-goodfellas. 

GOTTI	My brother Pete clocked 75 guys come up to me.

GOTTI	He undersold me. It was 75 guys come up to talk to me,

GOTTI	but they got nothin’ to offer me. Nothing.

GOTTI	Conversation. If conversation had calories, I’d be the fattest fuckin’ guy in the world

GOTTI	-Rudy? Can I talk to you a minute?

RUDY	Yeah, John.

GOTTI	You delivered the envelope to Dominick’s wife yesterday?

RUDY	Yeah. I did just like you told me.

GOTTI	No, not just like I told you.

RUDY	I dropped it off.


GOTTI	Who’d you bring with you?

RUDY	I was gonna bring my niece, but...

GOTTI	But you didn’t. 

GOTTI	One simple rule. Don’t you ever go to a guy’s house while he’s away 

GOTTI	and see his wife alone. If you ever do this again, 

GOTTI	I’ll park a bus up your ass fuckin’ sideways! 

GOTTI	You understand that?

RUDY	Yeah, John.

RUDY	Sorry, John. Sorry.

CHIN	Sit. Sit.

CHIN	John’s getting too much press.

CHIN	Oughta learn to duck. He’s got too much pride to duck and weave. 

GASPIPE	He don’t give a fuck. He’s gonna die in jail or the gutter.

CHIN	He’s makin’ us look bad. 

CHIN	Then there’s DeCicco.

CHIN	We know he arranged the hit on Paul. 

CHIN	That can’t go unchecked. 

CHIN	Otherwise we got capos whacking their bosses left and right. No.

CHIN	Not now, not ever.

SAMMY	What the fuck? 
YELLS	Frankie!

SAMMY	Frank! Frankie!

ANGELO	It was meant for you. 

GOTTI	What are you talkin’ about? 

ANGELO	I am tellin’ you, it was you-know-who did it.

ANGELO	I heard it on good authority. 

ANGELO	He and Gaspipe Casso are like two peas in a fuckin’ pod.

GOTTI	You heard. Your ears are bigger than your mouth.

GOTTI	First of all, I am friends with Chin. 

GOTTI	Second, Sam and Pipe go way back. Right, Sammy? 

GOTTI	And they’re grieving about Paul? Why would they grieve about Paul?

GOTTI	Whoever killed Paul, 

GOTTI	did everybody a fuckin’ favor. 

GOTTI	Maybe it was the cops. You know they pit us against each other.

GOTTI	That’s what they want us to believe, right?

GOTTI	Let’s take care of business.

GOTTI	Angelo tried to take matters into his own hands.

GOTTI	It was an unsanctioned hit on Gaspipe Casso. 

GOTTI	That didn’t work out too well for nobody.

HYDELL	Gaspipe!

GASPIPE	Who the fuck are you?

GOTTI	Good guys, bad guys, come in many different colors. 

GOTTI	New York’s finest, serving two masters. 

GASPIPE	I got all day.

GASPIPE	I got all week. 

GASPIPE	I mean it’s just me and you hanging out in the basement. 

GASPIPE	Just gimme a name. 

GASPIPE	Tell me who it was.

HYDELL	No.

GASPIPE	No?

GASPIPE	Okay.

GASPIPE	It hurt, doesn’t it?

GASPIPE	I can make it stop.

HYDELL	Okay.

GASPIPE	I can make it all go away. 

GASPIPE	Gimme a name.

HYDELL	Angelo Ruggiero. Angelo Ruggiero.

GASPIPE	Thank you. Thank you very much.

CHIN	You handle it and Angelo tried to whack another made guy without permission.

GOTTI	You got no proof of that.

CHIN	The shooter needed a little encouragement, but he told Gaspipe.

CHIN	He named Angelo. And there’s no good reason to disbelieve it.

GOTTI	Okay, but do I believe everything I hear? No. So, I’m gonna do my own investigation of this.

CHIN	Oh, yeah? How’s the other investigation goin’? 

CHIN	Heard anything about Sparks Steak House?

GOTTI	Yeah. The Caesar Salad is to die for.

CHIN	Angelo’s been askin’ for this a long time. There’s no dispute about that.

GOTTI	Let me tell you somethin’, Chin.

GOTTI	Nobody touches Angelo. Nobody. 

GOTTI	If it’s true that he acted without my approval, 

GOTTI	I’ll put him on the fuckin’ shelf like that.

CHIN	I know Angelo’s more than a brother to you,

CHIN	but he went off the record. This was unsanctioned.

GOTTI	Okay, but let me tell you somethin’. 

GOTTI	The Life means more than anything to Angelo. He’s a war horse.

GOTTI	It means more than it does to you or to me. 

GOTTI	He wakes up and goes to bed thinkin’ about it. 

GOTTI	If I put him on the shelf for life it’s worse than puttin’ a bullet through his heart.

CHIN	Then I vote to close this matter.

GOTTI	The matter’s closed.

GOTTI	The last time they moved me, do you know the only thing I took with me? 

GOTTI	Hm?

JOHN A.	No.

GOTTI	Your indictment. That was it. And do you know why I brought it?

GOTTI	Because I don’t give a fuck about my cancer.

GOTTI	I don’t care what they do to me in here. What’ll be will be. 

GOTTI	My concerns are you.

JOHN A.	I know that.

GOTTI	I must have read it 50 times and I tell you, I don’t see it. 

GOTTI	I don’t see it.

JOHN A.	I told you once I’d follow you over a cliff. 

JOHN A.	I meant it. But I’m thinking about our family now.

GOTTI	Your family? What family are you talkin’ about? 

GOTTI	You’re talkin’ about your 400 brothers, cousins and uncles?

GOTTI	Being a man is not being some guy who’s looking for “closure”, John. 

GOTTI	My freedom and my life take a back seat to my duty and manhood. 

GOTTI	These are my standards, John.

GOTTI	Now, listen up. This is important.

GOTTI	Never do anyone a small injury. 

GOTTI	You wanna hurt someone? Hurt him so bad he’ll never come back at you. 

GOTTI	Neil used to say to me “The boss is the boss is the boss.” 

GOTTI	It ain’t titles that honor men. It’s men that honor titles. 

GOTTI	Ange, Ange. What did you do? 

ANGELO	I did what I thought was best for you.

GOTTI	I saved your life, Ange. That’s all I can do.

ANGELO	The son of a bitch killed Frank!

GOTTI	I’m not goin’ to war with the Chin for the sake of Gaspipe fuckin’ Casso.

GOTTI	I ain’t doin’ it. Now, listen.

GOTTI	There’s 10 kinds of shitstorms comin’ down on us and you know what I had to do?

GOTTI	We had to have a meetin’ with the Commission, 

GOTTI	Why? Because of you. Because of you. 

GOTTI	Every boss wanted you dead.

GOTTI	Everyone.

GOTTI	You’re on the shelf for life. That’s it. 

GOTTI	Go. Go. Go.

ANGELO	Get out of here!

JOHN A.	Uncle Ange. He needs you! He made a big fucking mistake.

ANGELO	Don’t say another word. Don’t you say one word against your father. You hear me?

ANGELO	You hear me?

GOTTI	I had to. I can’t be treatin’ you any differently than I treat everybody else.

GOTTI	Now, if I let you violate my rules, 

GOTTI	the very principles that we live by, 

GOTTI	it weakens me and it weakens you. 

GOTTI	One day you may be the shot caller, the one that’s making the rules, 

GOTTI	and then you would be responsible for enforcing those rules. 

JOHN A.	You gave me the middle name Angelo. How do you expect me to turn my back on him?

GOTTI	You pray that I don’t know about it. 

GOTTI	I love him too. 

GOTTI	Go to bed.

VICTORIA	Who cares if he goes to see Angelo? 

VICTORIA	It’s not like John’s a part of that life.

GOTTI	Victoria, please. Don’t start. Okay?
 
JUDGE	Will the defendant please rise?

JUDGE	Has the Jury reached a verdict?

JURY FOREMAN	We, the Jurors in the above case, find the defendant John Joseph Gotti 

JURY FOREMAN	not guilty.

GOTTI	I won this trial fair and square.

GOTTI	Thanks to a little down payment to one of the jurors.

GOTTI	With my third victory over the government, 

GOTTI	the media nick-named me “The Teflon Don”. I guess it stuck.

FEMALE REPORTER 1	Mr. Gotti, are you the head of the Gambino Crime Family?

GOTTI	I’m the head of my family.

FEMALE REPORTER 2	Mrs. Gotti, do you know what your husband does for a living?

VICTORIA	He provides.

SAMMY	You know why you’re here?

JOHN A.	No.

SAMMY	You know everybody in this room?

JOHN A.	Yes

SAMMY	This is a society of brothers. La Cosa Nostra.

SAMMY	You’re now about to be inducted as a member of the Gambino Family.

SAMMY	Honor this oath. If you divulge any secrets of this family, 

SAMMY	your soul will burn like this saint. You never raise your hands to a made man.

SAMMY	If you ever get caught with a made men’s wife you’ll be killed. We don’t fuck with bombs. 

SAMMY	We don’t endanger civilians. The use of drugs is prohibited. 

SAMMY	Lastly, and most importantly, we don’t like rats.

SAMMY	We kill rats.

SAMMY	You’re questioned by law enforcement? You tell them to go fuck themselves.

SAMMY	You are now reborn. This is your baptism. 

SAMMY	And we’re your family.

SAMMY	Come here.

BOBBY	Come on.

SAMMY	I’d like you to meet your new soldier. This is your boss, your chief.

JOHN A.	This is the proudest moment of my life.

GOTTI	I’m so fuckin’ proud of you.

GOTTI	Look at us. Look at us!

GOTTI	Avanti, avanti.

JOHN A.	Ah, Elisa.

GOTTI	Now, Johnny. 

GOTTI	It’s like I said, it’s gettin’ tougher, it’s not gettin’ easier. 

GOTTI	Look around you, you got a few good soldiers, am I right?

JOHN A.	Yeah, I think you’re right.

GOTTI	This is not the time to make 20 guys. 

GOTTI	You know what I need? I need guys that do more than just kill. 

GOTTI	I need guys whose hearts beat the same, otherwise it won’t work. 

GOTTI	You know the law is coming down hard on us.


JOHN A.	If worse comes to worst we can find you a safe house, get you out of the country.

GOTTI	No. I don’t run. And I don’t hide in shadows either.

GOTTI	You know what I need? One year on the street uninterrupted. 

GOTTI	And I will build something that nobody can destroy. 

GOTTI	A hundred years from now, when we’re both dead, it’ll still be and continue to be a good thing.

JOHN A.	It’ll be one hell of a legacy to leave.

GOTTI	A legacy. 

GOTTI	Be it an hour from now, be it tonight, be it 100 years from now when we’re gone. 

GOTTI	It’ll be La Cosa Nostra. 

GOTTI	And I’m not talkin’ about gangs or clans, 

GOTTI	I’m talkin’ about New York, Florida, the fuckin’ West Coast and back. 

GOTTI	It’s gonna be the way I say it’s gonna be.

GOTTI	About a year after I put him on the shelf, Angelo Ruggiero died of cancer.

GOTTI	Ange, I know I hurt you.

GOTTI	But you fucked up and I had to do what was best for the Family. 

GOTTI	Frankly, I think he died of a broken heart.

GOTTI	By the way, I almost forgot. 

GOTTI	Sammy thinks that you should be running your own crew now.

SAMMY	You’ve paid your dues. You’re a credit to your father.

GOTTI	Normally I don’t show you no favoritism, 

GOTTI	but this time I’m gonna help you out. I’m gonna handpick your crew. 

GOTTI	I’m gonna give you Bobby 

GOTTI	I trust him with my life, and I trust him with your life.

JOHN A.	Is that okay with Bobby?

GOTTI	Ask him.

BOBBY	What? Being under a little punk like you? 

BOBBY	Madonna mia. My life. You’re the skipper now, Bo.

JOHN A.	You say the word, I’ll go over a cliff for you.

GOTTI	You already have. You’re gettin’ married.

GOTTI	Yeah. Where’s Victoria?

MAN	Hey, John!

GOTTI	Hey. Good to see ya.

GOTTI	Good to see ya.

MAN 2	Congratulations.

MAN 3	Congratulations.

OLDER MAN	Nice work, John . Nice work. Beautiful.

GOTTI	Vic!

MAN 3	Gotti. How are you?

GOTTI	Good to see you. Good to see you.

JIMMY ROSELLI	Little Pal, if Daddy goes away,

JIMMY ROSELLI	promise you'll be good from day to day.

JIMMY ROSELLI	Do as Mother says

JIMMY ROSELLI	and never sin.

JIMMY ROSELLI	Be the man your Daddy 

JIMMY ROSELLI	might have been. 

JIMMY ROSELLI	Your Daddy didn't have an easy start, 

JIMMY ROSELLI	so here’s the wish that’s dearest 

JIMMY ROSELLI	in my heart.

JIMMY ROSELLI	Each night how I'll pray, 

JIMMY ROSELLI	Little Pal

JIMMY ROSELLI	that you, 

JIMMY ROSELLI	you'll turn just out right, 

JIMMY ROSELLI	my Little Pal,

JIMMY ROSELLI	and if some day, 

JIMMY ROSELLI	some day you should be 

JIMMY ROSELLI	on a new, a new Daddy’s knee,

JIMMY ROSELLI	think about me 

JIMMY ROSELLI	now and then, 

JIMMY ROSELLI	Little Pal,

JIMMY ROSELLI	pray for me 

JIMMY ROSELLI	now and then, 

JIMMY ROSELLI 	my Little Pal.

GOTTI	Neil used to say 

GOTTI	“This life of us it’s a wonderful life.”

GOTTI	“If you can get away with it.” 

TOM BROKAW	The man some people consider to be organized crime’s 

TOM BROKAW	boss of all bosses, John Gotti, 

TOM BROKAW	was indicted today for the fourth time in five years.

TOM BROKAW	Gotti’s charged with the 1985 murder of mob boss Paul Castellano. 

TOM BROKAW	Prosecutors hope their best testimony this time will come from Gotti’s own mouth. 

GOTTI	You look at me like I don’t know who I am. I am the new boss. 

GOTTI	I do whatever the fuck I want without steppin’ over bounds.

GOTTI	Now, if somethin’ happens to me 

GOTTI	and I end up in the can, I want Sammy to be the acting boss. 

GOTTI	Is that clear?

BOBBY	Clear.

GOTTI	These are my wishes.

GOTTI	I’d be a billionaire if I was lookin’ to be poor. 

GOTTI	All I want is this sandwich here. 

GOTTI	Every time I fucking turn around there’s a new company.

GOTTI	And every time we got a partner... 

GOTTI	the boss will fuck with us. We kill him. 

GOTTI	He’s a yellow dog, I took your word for it, Sam, I allowed it to be done.

GUARD	Your pal of honor is not gonna be here for breakfast. 

GUARD	They took him away late last the night.

COURT CLERK	Please give your name.

SAMMY	Salvatore Gravano.

PROSECUTOR	Do they call you Salvatore?

SAMMY	Sammy.

PROSECUTOR	Can you please speak into the microphone?

SAMMY	Sure.

GOTTI	I didn’t follow my own advice. 

GOTTI	Never trust anyone who hasn’t done time. 
GOTTI	That’s where men are made.

GOTTI	Sammy the Bull became Sammy the Rat.

GOTTI	The government cut him a deal after admitting 

GOTTI	to his part in 19 murderers and testifying against me.

JUDGE	John Joseph Gotti 

JUDGE	you’ve been convicted on all counts of criminal racketeering, 

JUDGE	murder and conspiracy. 

JUDGE	You are hereby remanded to serve a term of no less than 5 life sentences. 

JUDGE	You will also be assessed a 50 dollar court fee. 

JUDGE	Do you have anything to say?

GOTTI	Yeah, Your Honor.

GOTTI	The 5 life time bids, that’s okay, but the 50 dollar surcharge,


GOTTI	you really know how to stick it to a guy.

JAMES M. FOX	Today another milestone in the fight against organized crime.

JAMES M. FOX	The Teflon is gone, the Don is covered with velcro 

JAMES M. FOX	and every charge in the indictment stuck.

NEWSMAN	Mayhem outside Brooklyn’s Federal Courthouse as John Gotti gets life,

NEWSMAN	and his supporters cry “foul”.

SUPPORTER 1	There’ll be an appeal and he’ll get off ‘cause it was very unfair.

NEWSMAN	Demanding a retrial they rush police lines.

SUPPORTER 2	They pulled a lot of dirty tricks and I don’t believe their witness.

NEWSMAN	Then try to break into the court to free the mafia boss.

SUPPORTER 3	He’s a good guy. He does a lot for the community.

SUPPORTER 3	They put him away for nothin’.

NEWSMAN	After today’s arrest, his supporters smashed and overturned cars. 

NEWSMAN	The verdict on John Gotti is less likely to be overturned.

NEWSMAN	Law enforcement officials 

NEWSMAN	fear that a violent power struggle may happen within Gotti’s family.

NEWSMAN	And, ironically, 

NEWSMAN	the only one who may be able to keep the peace is John Gotti.

GOTTI	My loyal crew member Eddie Lino was the first to go down.

GOTTI	Bobby Boriello, my closest friend and my son’s goombatta was next.

GOTTI	That’s the Life. They understood that.

JOHN A.	So, what’s goin’ on?

RUDY	There’s a contract out on me. 

RUDY	And the rest of Sammy’s crew.

JOHN A.	-Who’s behind it?

RUDY	Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti.

JOHN A.	Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti. 

RUDY	They’re out for you too, Johnny.

GOTTI	Why’re you so pissed off? Tell me!

VICTORIA	Don’t tell me about what’s coming down here! I had to read about this in the paper!

GOTTI	What papers?

VICTORIA	That our son is a target.

GOTTI	On the Daily News? On the fuckin’ Post? Since when do they tell the truth?

VICTORIA	I already buried a son. 

VICTORIA	You want me to bury another, then you will bury me too. 

VICTORIA	You swore to me, in our own bed, 

VICTORIA	you promised that you would not bring him into that world.

GOTTI	What world? Tell me the world you’re talking about.

VICTORIA	I brought him into this world. 

VICTORIA	You brought him into the Life.

GOTTI	Come on, shut up. You don’t know what you ...

GOTTI	Where are you goin’? Get back here!

GOTTI	Fuck!

JOHN A.	Look, I’m not gonna beat around the bush, I’m gonna ask you a question, 

JOHN A.	and regarding the answer one of us is gonna stand down. Did the chief order this?

JIMMY BROWN	No, no...

JOHN A.	Don’t play dumb with me! 

JOHN A.	This fuckin’ nonsense about Sammy and his crew, you telling me it came from my father?

JIMMY	No.

JOHN A	Then I suggest you stand down.

JIMMY	You are prepared to defend these guys?

JOHN A.	No, I’m prepared to defend my father. Whatever he says goes. Period.

JOHN A.	Get the fuck outta here.

TV NEWSMAN	Five organized crime families 

TV NEWSMAN	are in a state of flux at this point. 

TV NEWSMAN	New people are moving up to take up the place of the older ones who are now in prison, 

TV NEWSMAN	or who have been killed. 

TV NEWSMAN	He was locked up, or have under indictment are virtually 

TV NEWSMAN	every boss of every family 

TV NEWSMAN	in New York City and throughout the United States 

JOHN A.	You’ve got to be fuckin’ kidding me!

KIM	What the hell’s goin’ on?

JOHN A.	What’s goin’ on? What do you think’s goin’ on?

KIM	Oh, Jesus!

JOHN A.	Kids, come to Daddy. C’me here.

JOHN A.	I’m gonna be gone for a little while, alright? Don’t worry about nothin’.

JOHN A.	C’me here.

FBI AGENT	FBI, front door!

JOHN A.	Don’t worry about Daddy. I’ll be back in a little while.

NEWSWOMAN	We have today unsealed four federal indictments, 

NEWSWOMAN	charging a total of 40 defendants 

NEWSWOMAN	with a wide spread pattern of racketeering and other crimes, 

NEWSWOMAN	including multiple extortions, murder conspiracy,

NEWSWOMAN	telecommunications fraud, illegal gambling, 

NEWSWOMAN	money laundry and obstruction of justice. 

NEWSWOMAN	The defendant’s charged include John A. Gotti, 

NEWSWOMAN	also known as Junior, who was alleged to have exercised 

NEWSWOMAN	supervisory control over the Gambino crime Family 

NEWSWOMAN	since his father John J. Gotti was convicted 

NEWSWOMAN	of federal racketeering charges in 1992.

JOHN A.	These are just bullshit charges. 

ATTORNEY	John, there’s no way that they can’t tie you to any of those specific crimes.

JOHN A.	They don’t have to. It’s the RICO conspiracy. That’s the problem. 

JOHN A.	They just have to prove I’m a member of the enterprise.

ATTORNEY	We can beat them.

JOHN A.	And then what? They just throw more charges at me like they did with my father?

JOHN A.	I’ve had enough. I’ve been pulling back. 

JOHN A.	I’m ready to move on with my life.

ATTORNEY	You saying what I think you’re saying?

ATTORNEY	Alright.

ATTORNEY	If that’s what you wanna do. 

ATTORNEY	If you’re ready to walk away from this life, I’m happy for you. 

ATTORNEY	Just understand there are potential consequences to that decision

ATTORNEY	and that there are gonna be people out there 

ATTORNEY	who are gonna be very unhappy with the decision you make.

JOHN A.	That’s why, Charlie. You need to arrange for me a meeting with my father. 

JOHN A.	It needs to come from me directly. He’s dying. 

JOHN	He was my course. 

JOHN A.	Now it’s time to move on. I want closure.

GOTTI	John, I got no cancer in my brain and I got no cancer in my heart.

GOTTI	But what I wouldn’t do to have one more time to go into that courtroom 

GOTTI	and show ‘em what a man is, break their holes. 

GOTTI	You show ‘em what a man is. Show ‘em what it takes to have this.

GOTTI	We only got 5 minutes left.

GOTTI	I don’t know when or if I’ll ever see you again. 

GOTTI	And I don’t know if I got through to you or not, 

GOTTI	but I know you got a lot of thinking to do.

JOHN A.	I know.

GOTTI	I miss seeing you, John.

JOHN A.	You have no idea how much I miss seeing you.

GOTTI	You know, this meeting today 

GOTTI	was worth 55 years hanging upside down 

GOTTI	because now you now how I feel. 

GOTTI	I love you and adore you.

JOHN A.	I know.
 
GOTTI	So...

GOTTI	You do what you have to do 

GOTTI	and don’t worry about me. It doesn’t make sense. 

GOTTI	What’ll be will be.

GOTTI	You stand up strong with your head up.

GOTTI	Don’t cry. Don’t let them have the satisfaction.

GOTTI	Come on.

DOCTOR	Scissors.

NURSE	Yes, sir. 

GOTTI	What are you looking at me for? You’re gonna be here when I’m 82.

GOTTI	You are beautiful.

NURSE	Thanks, Gotti.

GOTTI	You ever met my wife Butch? She’s beautiful.

NURSE	Why are you fighting this so hard? 

NURSE	If you beat this, they’re just gonna send you back to solitary.

GOTTI	Every day I’m alive is a “fuck you” to the government. 

GOTTI	You understand?

GOTTI	My son Peter was at my bedside till the very end.

GOTTI	I didn’t want Vicky or the girls to see me like that.

GOTTI	I made Vicky promise and she respected my wishes.

DOCTOR	He’s in a lot of pain. 

DOCTOR	I know the morphine is no longer working. 

DOCTOR	Now, we can give him Ativan. It will induce a coma. 

DOCTOR	He’ll be alive, but he won’t feel the pain.

DOCTOR	Right. 
DOCTOR	Think about this, Peter. It’s your call.

GOTTI	Peter...

PETER	What do we do, Pa?

GOTTI	You keep your head up. You be strong. 

GOTTI	Okay? Promise.

PETER	I promise.


GOTTI	Alright.

MAN	Hey, John A., check it out!

NEWSMAN	One of the most high profile mobsters of recent times, 

NEWSMAN	John Gotti, died today in the prison hospital in Missouri, 

NEWSMAN	after a battle with throat cancer. 

NEWSMAN	Gotti was known as The Teflon Don or the Dapper Don, 

NEWSMAN	a moniker given as a result

NEWSMAN	of his penchant for wearing fancy double breasted suits. 

NEWSMAN	Gotti was acquitted a number of times prior to being sentenced 

NEWSMAN	to five consecutive life terms in 1992.

NEWSMAN	John Gotti dead today, at age 61.

SUPPORTER 1	Everybody here knows that he was a great man. 

SUPPORTER 1	He might have been in jail, but nobody’s a saint.

SUPPORTER 2	He didn’t go around killing civilians or, 

SUPPORTER 2	regular people, normal people off the streets. He more or less killed his own kind.

SUPPORTER 3	When he went to prison the crime rates started going up. The street punks were taking over. 

SUPPORTER 3	It was a lot cleaner neighborhood when, then Mr. Gotti was around.

SUPPORTER 4	John Gotti had to keep his family surviving. Gotti is the man!

SUPPORTER 1	And he kept the neighborhood safe.

GOTTI	John, how can you be so naive? 

GOTTI	Once they get you in, you will never be free again. 

GOTTI	They say you win this time, but next time they will make sure that you don’t.

JOHN A.	This is bullshit! 100 more fuckin’ years?

JOHN A.	You gotta be fuckin’ kidding me!

ATTORNEY	Calm down.

JOHN A.	No! My father told me they would never let me go. He told me that! 

JOHN A.	They wanna fight the legacy of John Gotti? Then let them fight John Gotti!

ATTORNEY	We’d like to believe that a trial in its purest form 
ATTORNEY	is a search for the truth.

ATTORNEY	But a search for the truth requires the willingness to see the truth.

ATTORNEY	Yesterday the prosecutor spoke to you about what he perceives to be 

ATTORNEY	the courage of his witnesses. 

ATTORNEY	Well, the truth is, sneaking up behind someone,

ATTORNEY	and shooting them in the head, is not an act of courage.

ATTORNEY	It’s an act of deception, it’s a display of treachery.

ATTORNEY	and it’s a demonstration of a cold-blooded willingness

ATTORNEY	to put their own interest above that of anyone else, 

ATTORNEY	regardless of the consequences. 

ATTORNEY	Contrast that with the courage required of John, who, admittedly, 

ATTORNEY	was in that Life, 

ATTORNEY	but who paid for his crime with many years in prison.

ATTORNEY	But John had the courage to walk away from that Life. 

ATTORNEY	The courage to tell his dying father, 

ATTORNEY	to whom the Life was everything,

ATTORNEY	that his obligations were to his family, not to a crime Family.

ATTORNEY	The reality is John left the Life on his terms. 

ATTORNEY	Cooperation in return for a reduced sentence? 

ATTORNEY	No, thanks. He said “I’ll do my own time for my own crimes.”

ATTORNEY	In 11 years since then, 

ATTORNEY	the government has spent millions of taxpayer dollars 

ATTORNEY	in 5 prosecutions. 

ATTORNEY	They shipped John all across the country under the most horrible conditions 

ATTORNEY	in what they jokingly refer to as “Diesel Therapy”. 

ATTORNEY	But in the end, they could not provide 

ATTORNEY	even a single credible allegation 

ATTORNEY	of any contact 

ATTORNEY	between John and the enterprise. 

ATTORNEY	Once again, the government just refuses to see the truth. 

ATTORNEY	When the government goes off the rails, 

ATTORNEY	driven by ego and obsession,

ATTORNEY	it’s incumbent upon its citizens to guide the government back on course. 

ATTORNEY	In this system, in this courtroom, you, the Jury, 

ATTORNEY	are the conscious of the government. 

ATTORNEY	It’s time to do the right thing.

ATTORNEY	Send him home. Send him home to his wife and his kids. 

ATTORNEY	Send him home to live the life he chose to live.

ATTORNEY	He’s earned it.

GOTTI	The government tried hard to break Johnny Boy, 

GOTTI	but my son took ‘em to task. 

GOTTI	5 trials in 37 months 

GOTTI	and the government walked away with nothin’. 

GOTTI	Listen to me, and listen to me good. 

GOTTI	You’re never gonna see another guy like me,

GOTTI	if you live to be five thousand.
