 ISSIE	There’s this horse. Mystic. Kind of like a…

DAN	Like a ghost horse.

NATASHA	I’ve seen Mystic. I told Issie to meet me there, but, I couldn’t make it.

CALEB	What if she gets in trouble then tries to swim out?

ISSIE	What do you want horse? He shows me things. Wait, what the? It was Natasha. She let Blaze out. Oh, I am so gonna get you.

ISSIE	Ta daaah.

DAN	Nice.

ISSIE	Thanks.

DAN	I was talking to Blaze.

ISSIE	Ha, ha, so funny.

ISSIE	So, what you doing today?

DAN	Ugh, more teaching, and then I’m practicing my speech for my Mum and Dad’s anniversary party.

ISSIE	Ugh, speeches suck.

DAN	Making them or listening to them?

ISSIE	Both.

DAN	Yeah, but you haven’t seen my slide show, I’ve got pictures of them when they were younger, their clothes are like, shame.

ISSIE	Oh, please tell me you’re gonna put in your baby pics.

DAN	Let me think about that. No. I’ll just put a song underneath, it’ll be sweet.

ISSIE	Ugh. Will it though? Because, no offence but your taste in music is, pretty suss.

DAN	I mean, yeah, I don’t follow the crowd, but like, ok, do you have any recommendations?

ISSIE	Yeah, I’ve got it.

ISSIE	You’re gonna have to let me know how it goes though.

DAN	Woah, aren’t you coming? It’s a big party at the marae, everyone’s going, you stay the night.

ISSIE	All together? Like a sleepover?

DAN	Yeah. Hopefully you don’t snore.

ISSIE	Yeah, no, I mean, maybe.

ISSIE	Right, I found a song for you, and send.

DAN	Thank you very much.

ISSIE	You’re welcome.

MITCH	Oh, hang on, this isn’t right, it’s way too, too runny.

MITCH	Can you pass the corn flour, it’s in the cupboard?

AMANDA	Oh, this expired in .

MITCH	Give it here, it’ll be fine.

AMANDA	I’ve seen where your culinary decisions take a wrong turn.

AMANDA	Oh Issie, not this again.

ISSIE	She let Blaze out on purpose.

AMANDA	We’ve been through this. Natasha loves horses, she’d never do anything to hurt Blaze, has to be another explanation.

ISSIE	Yeah. That she hates me.

AMANDA	If you see her later today, go easy on her ok, she will have just got back from seeing her mum, in Queenstown, Sam says she’s having kind of a tough time with her.

ISSIE	Oh, put the violins away, mum.

AMANDA	I’m just saying you could try and be a little bit understanding.

ISSIE	Maybe I would if she wasn’t such a lying, nasty…

AMANDA	Ok, right, that’s enough, moving on, oh, actually, I need to search for something.

ISSIE	What?

AMANDA	This um, yeah the, before the party bit, the ceremony, po, whi, ri, ri.

MITCH	Powhiri.

ISSIE	What’s a Powhiri?

MITCH	I’m just getting a park, I’ll see you in a few minutes.

AMANDA	Oh, hey, hi.

SAM	Oh hey, oh wow, you look amazing.

NATASHA	Can’t we just take them straight to the kitchen?

SAM	Grab a box, I’ll be right there.

AMANDA	How was your…

SAM	Oh, it was good, yeah. Come with me, I’ll show you something…

ISSIE	You’re completely two-faced, you know that?

NATASHA	Oh hi, Isadora. Nice to see you too.

ISSIE	You let Blaze out. I saw you. Security footage, loser. Even you can’t lie your way out of that one.

NATASHA	So what if I did? No one cares about your stupid, feral horse and no one cares about you either.

ISSIE	Oh, so you admit it? You let Blaze out.

NATASHA	I prefer to call it helping a prisoner to escape.

ISSIE	And you lied about the beach too?

NATASHA	So what?

ISSIE	I nearly drowned.

NATASHA	You can’t ride and you can’t swim?

ISSIE	You’ve really got it in for me, haven’t you?

NATASHA	I hate to break it to you, but you barely cross my mind at all. Now get out of my way.

ISSIE	Hey.

DAN	Hey, so we’re starting in like, one minute and I accidentally wiped the song that you sent me.

ISSIE	Don’t stress. I’ll resend.

DAN	Ok, sweet, see you soon.

KAHU	Leave that.

NATASHA	Oh, but I’ve got to take it…

KAHU	Put it down, we’re starting.

NATASHA	Oh no, I’m not…

KAHU	Ki tere girl, ki tere.

ISSIE	What’s happening?

MIKAERE	This is a time for us to come together, to make new friends, heal rifts, I suppose that’s what life is about aye? About aroha, our love. You know, and how we share that love, like, when we share a hug, even when we share a hug with someone we don’t like.

MIKAERE	And we are watched, by the spirits of the ancestors, of our marae. T?n? koutou, t?n? koutou, t?n? koutou katoa.

MANUHIRI	 …te whakapono, me te rangimarie, tatau tatau e.

MIKAERE	On the nose.

AMANDA	Yes. Quite right.

MIKAERE	Yeah, no, no, nose.

MIKAERE	Kei te pai, t?n? koe.

MIKAERE	Kia ora darling, I’m Dan’s nana.

DAN	T?n? koe.

MIKAERE	Kai.

CAROLINE	You ok?

ISSIE	Yeah, I just, thought this was gonna be a normal party. I didn’t expect the ceremony and everything.

CAROLINE	It’s cool aye? It brings everyone together. We’ve been helping out in the kitchen for hours and this is the happy result. Trust me.

ISSIE	Cabbage?

CALEB	You do know I got stuck on the beach with Issie, aye? The tide sucks around there, I thought we were toast.

NATASHA	It was supposed to be a joke.

CALEB	She’s trying real hard to fit in and you’re not helping. Just, chill. Ok.

ISSIE	Mmm, yum.

STELLA	Your first powhiri. Level achieved.

ISSIE	You know, it’s weird, it kind of had me, like, I dunno.

CAROLINE	Dan is so good at the haka, right?

ISSIE	Yeah.

CALEB	Hey, I meant to ask you, did you find any footage of Mystic on the CCTV?

ISSIE	No, put what I did find…

NATASHA	Hey.

ISSIE	Hey.

NATASHA	Um, about before, I’m sorry, ok. Blaze, was an, accident.

ISSIE	It didn’t look like an accident.

NATASHA	A mistake then, a big mistake. I’m glad she wasn’t hurt and the beach thing, honestly, it was just supposed to be a joke, I’m really sorry, truly. Truce?

ISSIE	Sure. Truce.

MIRIAMA	Turi turi koutou. Quiet everyone, my grandson Dan would like to say a few words.

CALEB	Woah.

ISSIE	Yep. She let Blaze out.

CALEB	Yeah, but she also said sorry, twice. We should have recorded it.

DAN	Kia ora wh?nau.

ISSIE	Oh no.

DAN	Nau mai, haere mai. Ko Miriama r?ua ko Jake ingoa m?tua… [the mihi continues]… kia ora.

ISSIE	Oh, I’ve got to stop him.

CALEB	Where are you going?

DAN	It’s really good to see all you guys here today, looks like we’ve got most of Kauri Point here, it’s a good thing that we got Tipene and the crew on security aye?

TIPENE	Kia ora Neph.

DAN	Kia ora Uncle.

DAN	And actually, um, thanks to everyone, all helping out.

DAN	Also, thank you Mitch for the um, for the, interesting cake.

DAN	Yeah. But the biggest thanks of all goes to my Mum and Dad who’s wedding anniversary actually brought us here in the first place.

DAN	Mum met Dad at Kauri Point High, but they didn’t get together ’til after they left, because Mum thought Dad was an egg.

JAKE	Not even denying.

DAN	There was this fancy-dress party. Mum was done up like a mermaid and Dad a fisherman. But Dad didn’t know how to get Mum to talk to him, so he got his fishing rod and he hooked her tail, and the rest is history.

DAN	Which you can see now.

ISSIE	Dan. Dan.

DAN	Cue the music.

ISSIE	Dan. No. Just…

DAN	What you doing?

ISSIE	Give it to me.

NATASHA	I prefer to call it helping a prisoner to escape.

ISSIE	And you lied about the beach too?

ISSIE	Just, give me the phone.

NATASHA	What. The. Actual.

ISSIE	Look, I know you’re angry, but the thing…

NATASHA	You tried to humiliate me in front of everyone. I thought we had a truce.

ISSIE	The truce came after, I was trying to stop it.

NATASHA	I don’t believe a single word you say.

DAN	Oi.

ISSIE	Dan, I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have sent you that file.

DAN	I just listened to the recording Issie. You planned the whole thing, so don’t tell me you didn’t mean to play it in front of everyone and you didn’t mean to ruin my speech, because you did.

ISSIE	I’m so, so, sorry, I just wanted to get back at Natasha, I didn’t think.

DAN	We welcomed you here Issie, and you treat us like this.

AMANDA	Issie.

KENNY	Kia ora, ladies and gentlemen. I’m your Mayor with the flair.

JAKE	Funny as though, honestly, I didn’t think I’d enjoy your speech so much.

MIRIAMA	Oh, leave him alone, look you did a great job, ok.

SAM	You alright?

AMANDA	Yeah, no, I think I might try Issie again.

SAM	Yeah, go, please.

KENNY	…I want to try a little something now I like to call a musical extravaganza, so put your dancing shoes on, or your high heels…

KENNY	…or Gents obviously who want to wear high heels nowadays, so without further ado.

ISSIE	I’ve ruined everything with everyone. It’s really bad and I don’t know how to fix it.

ANISHA	Listen, if you’re not having fun, just go home.

ISSIE	I can’t. We’re sleeping here tonight.

ANISHA	What? All of you? Sounding like the weirdest party ever.

ISSIE	It’s. Different.

ANISHA	Listen, I’ll call you later, yeah? When I’ve woken up properly. Love you.

ISSIE	You too.

CAROLINE	Hey, Hamish.

CAROLINE	Stella said you’re training hard, me too.

HAMISH	You?

CAROLINE	Yeah, you know, I’ve got my eye on, the Olympics.

HAMISH	Oh, I thought you just went to my sister’s pony club.

CAROLINE	Yeah, well, I’m intermediate, which is actually quite advanced and, um, yeah well, I mean you’ll see at the cross country.

HAMISH	The, the what?

CAROLINE	When you come see the trials, next week.

HAMISH	Oh, no I can’t, I’ll probably have training.

CAROLINE	But, Stella’s riding. You know that right? And you didn’t see her last time at the Family Fun Day.

HAMISH	Stella doesn’t care about stuff like that.

CAROLINE	Really? Well I guess she’s only your sister and you’re such a big, important, rugby star. Loser.

TOM	Oh, Kenny.

MITCH	Hey Tom. Hey, is there more hangi?

TOM	Yeah, Miriama left me some out the back.

TOM	I’ve gotta go.

AMANDA	Oh, party’s not your thing?

TOM	Yeah, yeah, nah, yeah, it’s just, I can’t, ah, do, small talk. Mmm. So, yeah, so, um, moving countries aye? That’s a big thing.

AMANDA	Ah huh.

TOM	Are you running away from something?

AMANDA	Oh gosh, you really don’t do small talk, do you?

TOM	Oh you know, it’s like, big, move, thing.

AMANDA	Yeah, it is. Um. I guess we just wanted, a new start.

TOM	Oh right. Yeah, I get that.

AMANDA	Really? What, you wanted a new start too?

TOM	Yeah, I mean, maybe, things got, difficult for a while, but you know, it’s all good, now, it’s great.

AMANDA	Ah.

TOM	Ah. What?

AMANDA	I had you down as someone, quite different.

TOM	Oh right, yeah, well, of course, you know, it’s hard to size up anybody when all you’ve done is yell at them.

AMANDA	Yeah, yeah that is, fair.

TOM	Yeah.

KENNY	Here’s a little number for Jake and Miri. Always gives me goose bumps seeing the love between these two. Jake and Miri, this one’s for you.

JAKE	Hey, hey babe.

KENNY	Really, has no one at Kauri Point got a dance move? Tom. Never mind. Sam. Sam, you’ve got the moves.

SAM	No, no, no, no, no.

KENNY	Show us how it’s done.

NATASHA	No, no, no, Dad, don’t, please, please.

SAM	Come on.

AMANDA	What?

SAM	Come on.

AMANDA	No, no, no.

KENNY	That’s what I’m talking about.

AMANDA	Everybody is staring at us.

KENNY	Something tells me we’ll be celebrating another anniversary sometime soon, am I right? Time to get frisky.

AMANDA	Oh, ok, that’s yeah, um.

CORRINE	Do you remember that time your dad went snorkelling and swam straight into a school of jellyfish?

CALEB	Yep, I was thinking the same.

SAM	Listen I’ve got to, um, yeah.

KENNY	Yeah, hey, I had a really good time. Yeah, I mean it.

SAM	Jake.

JAKE	Oh hey, nice moves boss.

SAM	Hey, um, I don’t want to talk shop on your happy day, but did you fix that wastewater overflow at the plant?

JAKE	Yeah. Yeah, it’s fine.

SAM	Good. You know I warned them, this could happen.

JAKE	It’s all sorted, ok. It’s good. Go enjoy yourself. Maybe ah, maybe have another dance.

SAM	Yeah, yeah, good.

NANNY RUTH	No point crying over spilt cake.

ISSIE	I’m so sorry.

NANNY RUTH	Don’t worry about it. That cake was a train wreck before you went anywhere near it.

ISSIE	Dan said that, well, Dan said that you get, messages, from the eels, in the creek.

NANNY RUTH	Sometimes yes, they let me know what’s going on.

ISSIE	Have you seen like, visions or anything?

NANNY RUTH	Of course. Spirits, dreams, visions.

ISSIE	What do you mean?

NANNY RUTH	I don’t believe in coincidences Issie. Do you?

ISSIE	I see this horse, this, amazing horse that shows up out of nowhere, it complicates everything, and then, vanishes. What do you think that means?

NANNY RUTH	Well, I think spirits are there to guide us. Help us. If you don’t know what they’re saying, you need to pay more attention.

ISSIE	Well, yeah.

NANNY RUTH	Don’t stay out here too long.

ISSIE	Why? Will a ghost get me?

NANNY RUTH	No. Mosquitos.

CALEB	Issie.

CALEB	I was wondering where you got to. We got your things. Are you okay?

ISSIE	Yeah. I think so.

AUNTIE	Turituri.

TIPENE	Sorry, Auntie.

AUNTIE	Well at least finish the song first.

NATASHA	Watch it.

ISSIE	I’m so sorry.

NATASHA	Yeah, I know exactly how sorry you are.

ISSIE	Hey Dan, I just wanted to say that…

STELLA	Come on, we’re playing touch.

ISSIE	Playing what?

STELLA	We need another girl. Come on.

STELLA	You’ve played before, yeah?

ISSIE	Uh uh.

STELLA	Just, pass backwards and run forwards.

ISSIE	Pass backwards and run forwards?

STELLA	You’ll be sweet.

HAMISH	Stel. Come join our team.

STELLA	Doubt it.

TIPENE	Let’s go.

TIPENE	Hey, penalty, she didn’t have the ball.

HAMISH	This is touch, no tackling. But good form.

NATASHA	I would say sorry, but you don’t know what that word means.

ISSIE	You’ve always had it in for me. You nearly killed me.

STELLA	I don’t know.

NATASHA	We don’t want you here, why don’t you just leave us all alone.

ISSIE	Get off of me.

ISSIE	Caroline’s a way better rider than you.

CAROLINE	That is true.

NATASHA	Yeah, well, everyone’s a better rider than you.

CAROLINE	Also true.

TIPENE	So, should I break this up, or what?

STELLA	Nah.

CALEB	It’s a bit weird, but I think they’re sorting something out.

TIPENE	Sweet.

AMANDA	Your Gran, can snore, she…

AMANDA	What happened?

ISSIE	Nothing.

ISSIE	Well, the others have all gone down to the jetty, if you want to join them?

NATASHA	Ok.

NATASHA	Come on, I’ll show you.

CALEB	Well, they’re alive.

STELLA	You two ok?

NATASHA	Never better.

ISSIE	Natasha.

ISSIE	I’m sorry about, the cake and they song. Everything.

DAN	Yeah, I know.

ISSIE	I guess I was just so obsessed with Natasha that I wasn’t thinking straight.

DAN	Did you sort it?

ISSIE	Yeah. I think. But, what about us? Are we still mates?

DAN	Maybe.

DAN	See you soon.

ISSIE	Hi, I just wanted to say thank you.

NANNY RUTH	Did you have a good time?

ISSIE	I had an amazing time.

ISSIE	There’s something else.

ISSIE	I have these dreams, about a ship, an old fashioned one. There are horses, and huge waves, and people are screaming, and, someone’s ringing a bell, and the other day I found a ship’s bell, on the other side of a cave, it’s all connected but, I just, I don’t know how.

NANNY RUTH	There was a shipwrecked here, maybe, two hundred years ago, it was carrying horses, so tragic, only one girl survived, the horses, they made it to land though, the herd lived here for years. My mother told me she saw them when she was young. But they died out long ago.

ISSIE	I think they might still be here.
