GARY	We have a conspiracy on our hands here in Salem.  Salem was once a jewel of the Western Coast, shining example of America.  We were a community of people who taught our children good morals and leadership values, but someone in Salem has decided to live by his own rules, rules written by Satan himself.  Our mayor has found time to sex up interns, but for three years no one has fixed the pothole in front of my house on 63 Nancy Street.  But this is obviously only a symptom of the real problem.  The real problem is immortality itself.North Salem School Board Meeting No. 246 Salem, Oregeon

MARIE	Immortality?

JAMES	Sir, do you mean immorality?

GARY	I'd like to request a time extension due to being interrupted by Ms. Martino here.

MARIE	Denied, and that's not my last name.

JAMES	What exactly is your complaint, sir?

GARY	With our Mayor having used his office as Gomorrah, and with parents still reeling from the filthy nude forest dancing in last year's production of The Crucible, I'm disgusted to learn that this school plans to perform Once Upon a Mattress this year.  Now, not only does it sound like a porno, upon further investigation this mattress show also glorifies an unwed mother so--no, go ahead laugh, because that's very funny, uh, unsafe sex is very funny, right?  Shame on you, Ms. Martino.

MARIE	Sir, stick to your topic.  Stick to your topic.

JAMES	No one here is named Martino.

GARY	Hey, I'll stick to my right to free speech, how about that?  Or did you already menstruate on that part of the Constitution?

JOAN	Menstruated?

TED	I think you mean the Bill of Rights.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Sir, watch it.  We have our little league team in the audience.

GARY	Good!  This is for them.  They need to hear it.  Because they're the ones who are gonna get…

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Okay, that's it.  Bobby, just do me a favor.  Get him out of here, please.

GARY	Brothers, stay the F away from me.

JOAN	Watch your language.

JAMES	Don't provoke him, Joan.

GARY	Are you threatening me, new woman?

JOAN	Yeah, I'm threatening you.  What are you gonna do about it?

GARY	This is what I'm gonna do about it.  I'm gonna use my free speech to make sure that kids of this town don't end up degenerated like the mayor.  You people talk and talk and do nothing.  I speak for the parents of this town when I say, "Stamp out the sin and the porn plays or you're gonna turn to salt."  And then this town is gonna end up being just another devil worshiping, homosexual pill-popping, paradise for all of America.

BOBBY	Come on.
MAN	Despite the outburst it looks like we already have recruiters from the department.  So with that decision we'll include it in tonight's meeting.  Thank you all for…

DIWATA	Hey!  Your mom's new to the school board, right?  So is mine.  I'm Diwata.

HOWIE	Di-what-uh?

DIWATA	Di-WATT-uh.

HOWIE	Uh, Howie.

DIWATA	Children of the board unite, right, Howie?  My private blog.  It's getting a lot of hits lately, you should check it out.

GARY	Are you afraid of, brother?

BOBBY	Are you afraid of shining the light on some truths?

GARY	Don't hold my arms so tight.  It's not necessary.

BOBBY	You know, Gary.  Come on.

DIWATA	You caved to a crazy man?

MARIE	I didn't cave.  I was outvoted, sweetie.
DIWATA	Once Upon a Mattress is the musical version of Princess and the Pea, censoring it is like putting pants on Elmo, so no one sees the nothing between his legs.

MARIE	Elmo doesn't wear pants?  I'm kidding.

DIWATA	Oh, God.
JOANY	eah, I'm threatening you.  What are you gonna do about it?

GARY	This is what I'm gonna do about it, i'm gonna use my free speech…

SUSAN	Solomon! Shut that off and do your homework.

GARY	You people talk and talk and do nothing.

JAMES	Come on, I voted for the changes, isn't that enough?  That guy and his argument were both crazy.

SUSAN	I thought you were against sex before marriage?

JAMES	You know, I--I am, but I'm also against not having sex after marriage.

SUSAN	Gimme a break.

DIWATA	Sitting at my Casio Keyboard thank God it's built to prerecord.  Otherwise, I couldn't play and sing at the same time.Ti-i-ime…son of a bitch.  I wanna thank all of my fans who posted comments on the new video of my current acting reel, and have been sending me good luck vibes for the big audition tomorrow.  Sadly, under pressure from local psychos my drama teacher, a man I'll call Gay Guy with a Neck Beard in order to protect Mr. Walter M. Healy's anonymity, has caved and agreed to purify the plot of Once Upon a Mattress,as a result of this lunacy the character of Lady Larken will no longer be pregnant out of wedlock.  We have a state-mandated teen mother's program at our school, but the board thinks an unwed storybook mom is too scandalous.  Lady Larken and I aren't both perfectly pretty, and I don't have her perfect soprano voice.  But the truth is the Lady and I have a lot more in common than you'd ever guess.  So Mr. Healy,this hot flow is for you.  Mr. Healy, you're a crap sandwich.  I'm pure and you're a crap sandwich.  Get some bread, you're balding head and some more bread you have head between bread.  Crap sandwich, yeah.  Sitting at my Casio Keyboard thank God it's built to prerecord.  Otherwise, I couldn't play and sing at the same time.  Ti-i-ime…

SINGER	Nobody wants to be alone, but tonight we're all believers, and I feel all right, with all of my heart.

JOAN	Howie?

HOWIE	Mom.  I'm getting ready to go out.

JOAN	Out?  Out with who?

HOWIE	Uh, a friend.  I can have friends here right?

JOAN	Are you gonna bring her back to the house?

HOWIE	No.

JOAN	All right.  Have fun, bug.  I love you.
SINGER	Nobody wants to be alone.

GARY	…the same conversation expecting a different result. We've seen the proof. That's not how this works.

SUSAN	Are you kidding me?

GARY	 And we can’t continue to continue having the same conversation. That's not what we do, all right?

MS. RIGGI	I can't run the story, Solomon.  It's against every rule here.

MALE STUDENT	Thank you, Ms. Riggi.

MS. RIGGI	And your dad is on the board.

SOLOMON	My stepdad and that doesn't mean I agree.  I'm my own person.

MS. RIGGI	Okay.  School officials are off-limits.

SOLOMON	Okay.  But what if--okay.  Fine.  I'll write about the mayor.

MS. RIGGI	The mayor.

SOLOMON	The mayor.

MS. RIGGI	What's the topic?
SOLOMON	How he's been having sex with teenagers.  Another intern's come forward it's in today's paper.
MS. RIGGI	Choose another topic.

SOLOMON	Religion.  See!  We can't write about anything actually affecting us.  Last week you vetoed my story about the stranger-danger sessions the school keeps holding.

MS. RIGGI	Because it's a direct criticism of the administration's policies.

SOLOMON	They hired experts to remind us not to let strangers touch us in our bathing suit areas.  That's what they said, our bathing suit areas.Some kids my age are already having sex and…

MS. RIGGI	Okay.

SOLOMON	I'm not, but…

MS. RIGGI	You're just trying to cause a stir, and that's not what real journalism is.

SOLOMON	You taught me that real journalism involves writing about the truth.  Look at my last article.  I can't submit clips like these to a top-tier journalism school.

MS. RIGGI	Solomon, this isn't a debate, and you can't be in here.

SOLOMON	I'm sorry, but it's hypocritical--hey Ms. Nish.  If you won't print my stories, then maybe I'll write a new one about freedom of speech in high schools.The Oregonian might be interested.

MS. RIGGI	Are you recording me?

SOLOMON	Just so I don't misquote you.

MS. RIGGI	Oh, my God.  You know what, then on the record I say why don't you ask your stepfather about our school's policies because he's on the school board that actually makes them.  I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

COACH PEMBERTON	I can help you.  It's not easy being new.  It takes time to make friends.  Have you thought about a, uh, sport?  Lacrosse?
HOWIE	No, I wanna start, um--we don't have a Gay/Straight Alliance here, and when I was in Portland I was…

COACH PEMBERTON	Have you ever played lacrosse?

HOWIE	But do you know why North Salem doesn't already have a GSA?

COACH PEMBERTON	If you wanna start a new club you have to petition through the school board.  I can't help with that.

DIWATA	But I know that I'll never live happily ever after.  Until after I'm a God.  Too forte at the end?Forte means loud in musical terms.  I'll teach you all the terms, don't worry.  Just…wish me luck.

OKSANA	Luck.

DIWATA	Did you have fun last night?

AUDITIONEE	Happy ever after, ever after.  I don't suppose to be happy.

DIWATA	Hey, Arnett, how well did you sweep the stage?  I'm dancing barefoot.
ARNETT	It's clean.

DIWATA	FYI, Mr. Healy, I'll be performing all songs as written.  That means that this Lady Larkin will still be pregnant, as per the author's original intent.

WALTER	Diwata, honey, I have to manage complaints from parents.  This is a high school.  We don't wanna make it seem like we're glorifying a pregnant woman who isn't in a stable relationship.  It's just a little trashy.  Sorry, I cant.

DIWATA	Marty, if I start to riff you got to hang with me, bud. Don't get thrown like last year, okay?

WALTER	No.  Diwata, last year we talked about bringing your own material into my audition.

DIWATA	Chill, Mr. Healy, it's a medley.

WALTER	How is that different?  Oh, here we go.

DIWATA	The actress hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear.  She won't join your clubs.  She won't dance in your halls.  She won't help the hungry once a month at your tombola's.She'll simply take control as you disappear.  No I'm not throwing away my shot.  I am not throwing away my shot.  And yo, I'm just like my country I'm young scrappy and hungry, and I'm not throwing away my shot.  We're gonna rise up, time to take a shot.  I'm gonna rise up time to take a shot.  We're gonna rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up.  How would you like if you were a man, playing the part of a toad?Crawling around on your elbows and knees eating the dust in the road.  Toads!  Toads!  All of your people are toads.  Then I'll be happily happy, yes, happily happy.  And thoroughly satisfied, satisfied, satisfied.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.
MS. RIGGI'S STUDENT	Pick one, Solomon.

MS. RIGGI'S STUDENT	Yeah, man, hurry up.

SOLOMON	I can't choose any of these topics.

MS. RIGGI	You can follow the rules or you can leave.  I'm sorry but I don't have time for this every week.  Great choice.

SOLOMON	Hey, I was wondering if I could interview you for an article I'm writing about the auditions, for the school paper.  I'm Solomon, we're friends on Facebook.  I've liked a lot of your Instagram post.Seriously, Mark?

MARK	Oh, you know, I was once upon in your mattress.

WALTER	Okay.  Everyone, just remember in the words of Stanislavski, there are no small parts, only small actors.

CASEY	I got it.

CASEY'S FRIEND	Yay.
SOLOMON	Hey.  I was wondering if I could interview you about these auditions for the school paper.

HOWIE	It's time for North Salem to have a GSA.  My old school had one and most schools in Oregon do, so don't think I'm asking for some, kind of, fringe thing or whatever. North Salem School Board Meeting No. 247

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Oh, look I'm--I'm--I'm proud of you that you've spoken your mind.  Good for you, your--your mom has--has raised a fine young man but we've considered a GSA in the past and the Board's unanimous decisionhas always been that is more of a social hour and not a formal club that the district should fund.

MARIE	Well then we need to vote again, I was never part of that.

JOAN	I was…

MARIE	You just have discussions.

JOAN	…Howie, when he did the research on how many schools actually have it and the overwhelming…

HOWIE	Mom, mom, just…

JOAN	…majority do.

MARIE	It's very true.  Let's at least have a discussion about it.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Okay, we'll just put it to a vote.

MARIE	Well, it's a yes for me.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Uh, no, for me.
JOAN	Of course, yes.

TED	No.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Um, James, where are you on the--on this issue?

JAMES	I'm a no on the GSA, for me, I agree to more of a social hour.

MARIE	Jesus Christ, James, really?

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Okay.  No's have it.  Look, Howard, there are existing clubs that--that are lacking in--in student interests.  There's Portuguese Club, which is hungry for members and Recycling Club.
MARIE	It's not called recycling.

JOAN	He means the Environmental Action Committee.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Speech and Debate.  But for the record, the district fully supports gays, lesbians, and…

TED	Latino's.

HOWIE	Okay.  Thank you.When I was in high school, I felt, like, I had so much to say but nobody was listening.  A lot of movie stars and politicians got their start in Speech and Debate because on the debate side of things you have all kinds of competitions where you have to make your point of view clear and convincing and on the speech side of things you have acting competitions.  Through dramatic interpretation, you get the opportunity to play all the roles in a scene yourself.  So that means you're playing Romeo and Juliet, so just grab a couple friends, it only takes, like,three people minimum to start a team and join Speech and Debate, it's the only club designed for you to find and strengthen your voice.

DIWATA	I want to open myself.  I want the light of God, I want the sweet love of Jesus, I dance for the devil, I saw him.  I went back to Jesus and I kissed his hand.  I saw Sarah Good with the devil, I saw Goody Osborne with the devil, I saw Bridget Bishop with the devil.  No more time for my country ‘tis of thee. From now on it's my country ‘tis of me.  I don't need friends.  I don't need to be in the school of musical that the school board has frauded.  I have music in my body, I am music.  Mr. Healy, thinks an unwed mother is too racy for us.  Are we in Salem, Oregon or Salem, Massachussetts?  Circa 16--whenever the heck those witches were being hunted.
SOLOMON	1692.

DIWATA	You can't burn me, this witch is fireproof.  So try and hang me and see how strong my neck is.

MARIE	Diwata, what is going on there?

DIWATA	No, mom.  But I'm an actress, Speech & Debate sounds like homework that nerds wanna do because regular homework isn't, I don't know, enough?

SOLOMON	Just read the part that says D.I. on the homepage.  They call it competitive acting.  You'll see why I called you.
DIWATA	Welcome to North Salem's revived Speech & Debate Team.  My name's Diwata, and as team captain…

SOLOMON	Self-appointed team captain.

DIWATA	I'm not acknowledging that remark.

SOLOMON	And I'm Solomon, and please know that you can come to me with any questions.

DIWATA	Or you could come to me.  So Solomon, doesn't get bugged too often.

SOLOMON	We're gonna go…

DIWATA	We should play…

SOLOMON	…over the different debate categories.

DIWATA	Hey, can we play ice breakers?

SOLOMON	No, I'm running the media, please?

DIWATA	Should've played ice breakers.

MALE STUDENT	Who's our faculty advisor?

MALE STUDENT	Who's gonna sign my transcript?

SOLOMON	Uh, we don't have an official faculty adviser, yet, but it shouldn't be a problem given the decent turnout today.

DIWATA	Solomon, tell them about the tournament in the city.  We travel people.

SOLOMON	Okay.  Okay.

DIWATA	The Portland invitational is two weeks away.

SOLOMON	But first, travel is--yes?

FEMALE STUDENT	I don't get this, who are you?and who are you?  This is so weird.

DIWATA	I'm Diwata and this is Solomon.  My background is in legitimate theatre and blogging.  Solomon's more into the debate events, like Lincoln-Mercury.

SOLOMON	It's Lincoln-Douglas.  After the president and Stephen Douglas.

DIWATA	Right.

SOLOMON	It's one-on-one debating.

DIWATA	Kids in the Know call that category LD, that's the lingo for that event.  I'll teach you all the terms, don't worry.

SOLOMON	I'm not worried.
DIWATA	Okay.  If we could all get into a circle…

SOLOMON	This year's debate topic is Resolved: When in conflict, an individual's freedom of speech should be valued over a communities moral standards.  In a year with our mayor--he's in trouble and with the school censoring our newspaper articles, this is pretty relevant, yeah?

DIWATA	Solomon, you're freaking people out.  It can be fun too.  The best category is called Dramatic Interpretation, where you perform all the parts of a play yourself, witness.Welcome to a tale of witchcraft, where puritan Marry Warren stands before the court, unsure of whether or not telling the truth will set her free or set her on fire, so get ready.  And if you feel flames, don't pull the fire alarm.  Things are just really heating up in The Crucible by Arthur Miller.

SOLOMON	I'm saying that we aren't even official until we have at least three members.
DIWATA	Three members, how hard can that be?

WALTER	Guys, you shouldn't be hanging out in the hallways.

DIWATA	Casey, shouldn't be allowed to sing those notes and you shouldn't be allowed to direct traffic.

SOLOMON	Oh, my gosh, Diwata.  We're leaving.  We're leaving.

DIWATA	Every guy in school has a boner for her.  Oh, you too?  Great ass, right?  Here's the thing.  After one baby, it'll sink to the floor, but she won't stop singing and you'll be stuck listeningto that off-key screeching everywhere.  The car, the shower, is that really what you want?

SOLOMON	No.  I don't want Casey.  I'm kind of seeing someone else.

DIWATA	Is she from Canada or Youth Group?

SOLOMON	Shut up.  We met online.

DIWATA	Online?  Only losers meet people online.  Only losers.I know how to get our third member.

HOWIE	No.

DIWATA	Yes.

HOWIE	No.

DIWATA	Yes.

HOWIE	No, there's no way you can get me to do this.

DIWATA	Can you please not shout?  Look, I saw your board room performance, you are a…

HOWIE	It wasn't a performance.

DIWATA	…terrible public speaker.  This is the perfect way for you to get your--whatever you call it, your lesbians-in-love club.

HOWIE	You really cannot be back here.Listen, I watched your Podcasts and they're entertaining, but I'm not about to join the geek club.

DIWATA	You watched them?  You think I'm entertaining?  Thank you.  I think you're, um, too young to meet teachers in public parks at night.

HOWIE	You don't know me at all.

DIWATA	What I do know is if you join the team and debate issues you care about while wearing the skinny jeans you're rocking right now, all the boys will be begging for your numberafter you beat them down with your passionate words.  What do you even need a GSA for?  Homophobia is so 1985.

HOWIE	No.

DIWATA	Yes.

HOWIE	No, no, no, no, please.

DIWATA	You have less to worry about another minorities.  Less than women.  I'm a double minority, I'm female and Filipino.

HOWIE	You don't look Filipino.

DIWATA	You don't look gay.  Yes, you do.

HOWIE	It's the hair, isn't it? Is it the hair?

DIWATA	Yes, blonde boy.  And P.S., what shade of blonde are you, ebony?

HOWIE	You just don't really--I'm an alien in this town.  When I was in Portland, at least there were other guys that were like me.

DIWATA	Portland, do you say?  Home of the first competition of the year, just two weeks away.  Think of it as a free trip back to your roots.

MAN	So, you wanna know about Speech & Debate.
GIDEON	Oh, I wish.

LUCY	You wish?

GIDEON	I wish.

GENIE	Someone's been wishing for fun, friends, and new adventures.  Well, I have the epitomy of success for all promising high schoolers.

GIDEON	Speech & Debate?  But I'm interested in talking about things affecting our country right now.

GENIE	Well, Gideon, your wish is granted.  Since you are such a skilled writer, why not try persuasive speaking.  You get 10 minutes to give a speech on whatever your heart desires or if you're feeling argumentative.
MAN	After we're faced each time with a crisis.

LUCY	Hey, wait.  What's in this for me?

GENIE	Lucy, if you're a flare, you'll shine in the interp categories, like Dramatic Interpretation.

LUCY	Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

GENIE	Group Interpretation.

LUCY	I have something worse than stomach cancer and you gave it to me.

GIDEON	The only thing I gave you was love.

GENIE	Love and stomach cancer.

DIWATA	I can't think of a single thing about that video that wasn't awful.
HOWIE	The genie wasn't so bad.

DIWATA	You're a creep show.

SOLOMON	We need to pick what events we'll do.  I don't wanna get laughed out of Portland.  If we're gonna do this, we need to rehearse.

DIWATA	Sorry, please continue, professor.

SOLOMON	I'll take Persuasive Speaking.  Resolved: When in conflict, an individual's freedom of speech should be valued over community's moral standards.
HOWIE	Wait, if it's resolved, why do we have to debate it?

SOLOMON	The School Board has been shielding students from important discussions about abortion, religion, politics.

DIWATA	I don't care what you're saying because all I see is robot.

SOLOMON	But who are they protecting, us?

DIWATA	Be a real boy.

SOLOMON	Or the adults who would rather ignore our issues rather than engage them?

DIWATA	Eye contact, Solomon.  I saw Goody Osburn with the Devil!I saw Bridget Bishop with the Devil!  I saw Goody Hawkins with the devil!

HOWIE	Looks like you're having an orgasm while getting murdered.

SOLOMON	Communities' morals don't include homosexuality, shouldn't be forced to start a GSA.

HOWIE	It should be accepted because in the constitution…

SOLOMON	Thomas Carlyle said that, "The best effect of a book is that it excites the reader to self activity."

HOWIE	…it clearly states all men are created equal, not all straight men, and no one's forcing on the community.

SOLOMON	Why shouldn't communities have the right to censor playsor change newspapers articles if they incite harmful activity?

HOWIE	Who the hell is Thomas Carlyle?  Oh, okay.  That's nice.  That's nice.  All right.  Well, I'm gonna kick your ass.  Come at me!

DIWATA	Oh, whoa, hey.

SOLOMON	The School Board needs to stop shielding students from meaningful discussions…

DIWATA	Eyes.  Hands.  Where are your hands?

SOLOMON	…about abortion, religion, sex, politics.

DIWATA	Your spirit animal is wounded.  You hit him with your car.  Don't let him die.

SOLOMON	Indeed, the very debate about whether a GSAshould be an officially…

DIWATA	Radiate likability.

SOLOMON	…be--should be…

DIWATA	Stop thinking about genies.

SOLOMON	…an officially recognized group.

DIWATA	Eyes.

SOLOMON	But who are they protecting?

DIWATA	Where are your hands?

SOLOMON	So why should a community stand by a school play if it's characters behave in a manner that ecourages lewd behavior?

HOWIE	Well, do we take The DaVinci Code off the shelves to keep kids from stealing the Mona Lisa?  Who's my bitch now?
DIWATA	Giles is dead.  They press him, John.  Press?  Great stones they lay upon his chest until he plead aye or nay.  They say he give them but two words "more weight," he says, and died.  More weight.  Oh, crap.  I forget the rest.  Um, okay.  Okay.  That's a wrap, boys.I'm meeting with Bellingham tomorrow to get him to sign off on Portland.

SOLOMON	I thought you already had approval.

DIWATA	I do.  Relax.  I babysit his kid, Jean, who's completely obsessed with me.  Kids love me, just FYI.  So there won't be any problems.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	This is a big problem.  I can't let you guys travel, not under the school's name.  Not without an approved budget,schedule, and a faculty advisor.

SOLOMON	Are there conditions?

HOWIE	What did he say?

DIWATA	I need to get a faculty advisor to sign off and I know someone who will do it.  Mrs. Poluski.

HOWIE	But what about money though?

SOLOMON	Who's she?  I've never heard of that teacher.

HOWIE	Because I'm working two shifts and I definitely can't afford…

DIWATA	Relax.  Ladies, relax.  We get reimbursed as long as we collect all the receipts, that's how the system works.  I'll just use my mom's emergency credit card until…
SOLOMON	Wait, who is Mrs. Poluski?

DIWATA	Mrs. Poluski, these are the other star competitors, Howie and Solomon.  Guys, this is Mrs. Poluski.

OKSANA	Poluski is name of Serbian rapist husband.  I am Oksana.

HOWIE	Oh, my God, did you just pay her?

DIWATA	Lets talk about our uniforms.  You have to wear a suit.

HOWIE	I don't own a suit.
DIWATA	Well, borrow one from Solomon.

HOWIE	Have you seen his wardrobe?

SOLOMON	Hey, Casey.

DIWATA	Exactly.  He dresses like he's already in this club, so let's go with that.

HOWIE	I'm not even his size.

DIWATA	We'll make it work.  Are you cheating on your internet girlfriend already?

SINGER	So come a little closer, there is something I can tell ya, you are such a rollercoaster and a killer queen you are, we took the bones out from the road, those endless nights that we traveled we stole, you let your clothes fall to the floor.
HOWIE	Come in.

SINGER	And lit a fire while I waited for more, and now I'm running and I won't stop I don't wanna go, I think about it every day and night I can't let go, hey, I'm never the same, it's a hundred miles an hour on a dirt road running away, so come a little closer, there is something…

DIWATA	Finally, no more small town radio.
SINGER	And you don't belong to me, yeah, yeah.

DIWATA	Whoa, dude, that was aggressive.

HOWIE	Sorry.  Um, it's--that song.

DIWATA	What?

HOWIE	Fine.  So, when I was nine, I was a boy scout and--what's funny about that?

DIWATA	Everything.  Literally everything.

HOWIE	Thank you.  So, for the talent show that year,all the other kids were doing like wrestling moves and tying knots and, um, I decided I was going to make up my own dance to that song.  And the dance had all these really special moves and I was going to teach all the other kids, but, um…

DIWATA	Don't feel bad.  Mary Warren got in trouble for dancing naked in the forest with Tituba.  It's nothing to be ashamed of.  Guys, Mary Warren is the starof the new musical I'm writing.  It's time the leader of naked forest dancing gets her due.  It's called Crucible.  Based on Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible.

SOLOMON	So what happened with the dance?

HOWIE	Oh, um, no, we--I actually never ended up doing it.  I did archery or they ran out of time or something, I forget.

DIWATA	Wow.  Really good story, Howie.

SINGER	Yeah, yeah, freedom, oh, freedom, freedom.

DIWATA	Oh, guys, this competiion is gonna be so chill.

HOLY GHOST STUDENTS	Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost.

WOMAN	There was blood in my eyes.  Where?  It was dripping out of my sockets.

WOMAN	And mom said, "Don't forget your little brother.  So I wrapped him up tight and off we go."

DIWATA	Holy.  Whoa.
LINCOLN/DOUGLAS DEBATE CONTESTANT	Excuse me.

HOWIE	This is--this is cool.

WOMAN	But the truth on all that.  And mom said, "Don't forget your little brother."

DIWATA	My first event is upstairs.

HOWIE	And mine's--mine's in the library, so I need…

SOLOMON	I'm right here.  So…

DIWATA	Okay.  Come on, circle up.  Bring it in.  Can we get in a circle, please?
SOLOMON	This is a triangle.

HOLY GHOST STUDENTS	Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost.

DIWATA	Okay.  I just wanna say, don't be intimidated by these guys, okay?  You guys have done such amazing work these last few weeks and you have something that they don't, okay?  So just remember that…

HOLY GHOST SENIOR	We have the Holy Spirit on our side.  Who's on yours?

DIWATA	A gay guy and an overachiever.

HOLY GHOST FRESHMAN	That's like our whole school.
LINCOLN/DOUGLAS DEBATE HOST	Welcome to the first round of the Lincoln/Douglas Debate.  Competitors, you have six minutes to make your case.

LINCOLN/DOUGLAS DEBATE CONTESTANT	Resolved: When in conflict, an individual's freedom of speech should be valued over a community's moral standards.  The first problem is that moral standards have no standard in a community because all communities are different imposing strictures relieved of all impression.  This concept as I understand it could be found in the book, The Phenomenon of Revolution, page 170.  Contention one, oppression crushes human dignity.  By its very definition, oppression is cruel and unjust.  The question becomes, "How much weight we should give to this pain?"  Justice also maintains credibility as a--as a central valuebecause it is the concept which regulates the terms of all social contracts, as well as being an unlimited good.

LINCOLN/DOUGLAS DEBATE CONTESTANT	People talk down to us because they're looking down at us.  Being short in America today means that we're facing a variety of prejudices and I am here to convince you that those challenges and prejudices that height-challenged Americans faced today are not only real, but pervasive and they should be dealt with.No matter what you're size, you can soar to new heights.  Thank you.

HOLY GHOST FRESHMAN	Join me on one woman's extraordinary quest.  For though we all have to make tough decisions in life, a few of us will ever make a decision as difficult as Sophie's Choice by Alan Pakula.  You may keepone of your children.  I have to choose?  I cannot choose.  Be quiet or I will send them both over there.

PERSUASIVE SPEAKING JUDGE	Up next is contestant 89, speaking for the opposition.

SOLOMON	But we're supposed to deliver our prepared topics, aren't we?

PERSUASIVE SPEAKING JUDGE	Right.  You can speak in agreement in round two. For now, you need to argue the opposition.

SOLOMON	Um, okay.  My opposition would be that short people are in fact less intelligent than their taller counterparts.  The speaker's weak thesis was supported by citing countless, well-known, successful short people, but where is the science?  If we're not using facts then I could similarly surmise that being short does in fact make you stupid because you can't see as much as taller people and you don't have as big a brain cavity.  Using the speaker's logic, I'd argue that being short has a lot to do with how doomed you are in life.

PERSUASIVE SPEAKING JUDGE	Contestant 89, you were supposed to argue the opposition to your own prepared topic.

DIWATA	Welcome to a tale of witchcraft where Puritan Mary Warren stands before the courtroom unsure of whether or not telling the truth will set her free or set her on fire.  So get ready and if you feel flames, don't pull the fire alarm.  Things are just really heating up in The Crucible by Arthur Miller.  Why are you concealing?  Have you sold yourself to Lucifer?  Oh, I'm a good girl--I--Tituba made me do it.  She makes me drink blood.  Blood.  My baby's blood? No, no, chicken blood, I give she chicken blood.

LINCOLN/DOUGLAS DEBATE CONTESTANT Truly, a society cannot have too much justice.  The criteria I would propose, to give clarity to this value is human dignity.  People as diverse as Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, John McCain, Malcolm X and Susan B.  Anthony were willing to place themselves at risk for this concept.  And that's why freedom of speech isn't free at all.

LINCOLN/DOUGLAS DEBATE JUDGE	Contestant 43, you have three minutes for your rebuttal.

MAN	Congratulations.

ANNOUNCER	A job well done to all those competitors who have advanced.  Please proceed to your next round.  For those who did not advance, the cafeteria is available for a short time and accepts all major credit cards.  Finally, congratulations to the Holy Ghost Academy…

HOLY GHOST FRESHMAN	Hey, is that you, man? I heard what you did on your PSOPP.  Can we get a picture?  Thanks man.

DIWATA	What was that?

SOLOMON	It's nothing.  I made a mistake.  Can we go now?

WOMAN	That's the kid.

SOLOMON	I can't believe I care about this.  This is so stupid.

HOLY GHOST STUDENTS	Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost.

HOWIE	Well, we can't just go home now, can we?  Come on.

SOLOMON	My parents are going to kill me if I'm not home in time.

HOWIE	Chill out.  It's almost happy hour and you don't look happy.  Get your fakes up.
SOLOMON	My fake what?  No, we have to go home now.

DIWATA	Let's just vote on it.  I love how hot I am in gay bars.

HOWIE	Give me one second.

DIWATA	You know him?

HOWIE	Yeah, are you good?

DIWATA	Yeah.

BARTENDER	Your friend looks pretty miserable over there.

HOWIE	It's, uh, it's been a long day.  Any suggestions?

SOLOMON	They tell me not to write about the mayor.I don't.  I don't write about you and Healy either.  I give in to everyone and where does it get me?

HOWIE	Who told you about me and Healy?

SOLOMON	I should still write an article on it.  I might.  It's news.  Real news.  He shouldn't be allowed to teach at our school and you…

HOWIE	You don't know about what happened.

SOLOMON	I can guess, but I know it's pretty gross and illegal.

HOWIE	First of all, I'm 18 which means I'm an adult, so I can talk to whoever I want, okay?

DIWATA	You look like you could use a drink.

SOLOMON	You look like you could use a shower.

SINGER	Don't wanna wait for you.  Don't wanna have to lose.  All that I've compromised to feel another high.

HOWIE	You know, it must be really sad being you, obsessed with everyone else's life, but not having one of your own.

SINGER	I wanna feel like you've let me go.  I had to break myself to carry on.
SOLOMON	I don't wanna be like this.

SINGER	No love and no admission.  Take this from me tonight.  Oh, let's fight.

HOWIE	Then don't.

SINGER	Oh, let's fight.  Oh.

DIWATA	What?  What was that all about?

HOWIE	The bartender gave me Mollys, and I gave it to Solomon.

DIWATA	What?

HOWIE	He needs a little pick-me-up.

DIWATA	You're crazy.

HOWIE	That's quite cold.
SINGER	Let go, let go, let go of everything.

DIWATA	I didn't even get cast as Tituba.  Healy said it was a race thing which in my opinion is a totally amateur point of view, but…

BOUNCER	Baby girl, you're not even black.  How are you gonna be Tituba?

DIWATA	Well, hold up.  Walheed, back it up.  Historically, Tituba was South American Arawak, some shit like that.  So…
DIWATA	Hey, Howie, settle this debate for us.  You've read The Crucible, right?  Oh, my God.

BOUNCER	Really?  Really?  Really?  Really, wonder boy?

SOLOMON	Hey.

BOUNCER	I'll get somebody to clean this up.

SOLOMON	I guess--If you're going inside, it’s going on.

DIWATA	I'm gonna go get the car.

SOLOMON	Ladies' man.  Oh, it's so awesome.  Guess what, I--I'm a ladies' man.Uh, I just try to get with girls, what's…what's wrong with me?

HOWIE	Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Just calm down buddy, okay?

SOLOMON	I'm not handsome.

HOWIE	No…no, you're handsome.  I mean, it's just all of your shirts have alligators on them.  It's like you're always in a costume.  It's like you have no personality, all right, maybe that's why you have no friends.
DIWATA	Crap, they towed my car.  It was only, maybe, three feet into the no parking zone.

DIWATA	Howie, what time is the last bus home?

BUS ANNOUNCER	Last call for bus 49, local service to Eugene.  First stop is Salem.  The bus leaving in three minutes.

DIWATA)	Ugh, okay.

BUS ANNOUNCER	All passengers should be aboard, aboard bus 49…


DIWATA	Solomon.

BUS ANNOUNCER	…local service to Eugene.  First stop is Salem.

DIWATA	Thank you.
BUS ANNOUNCER	The bus leaves in three minutes.

DIWATA	Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah Yes, that’s fine.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Ma'am, hi.  I'm so sorry.  This is the last bus to Salem, right?

BUS DISPATCHER	It sure is.

DIWATA	Oh, thank God.  Okay.  We would love three tickets.  Uh, wait, where's Solomon?

HOWIE	Is that him right…

HOWIE	Solomon, Solomon.

DIWATA	Oh, my God.

HOWIE	Solomon, what are you doing?
SOLOMON	They hate my clothes.

DIWATA	Solomon.

HOWIE	What the hell are you doing?  We're gonna miss the bus.

SOLOMON	Why do you hate me?

HOWIE	We could talk about this when we're on the bus, okay?  Can we just…

DIWATA	You just--just get him out.  Get him out.

HOWIE	Solomon, just give me your hand, okay?  Stop it

DIWATA	Oh.  Guys, come on, you guys.

SOLOMON	Where's my phone?  Oh, no.
HOWIE	Sorry.  I thought you'd be more fun on drugs.

DIWATA	Guys, I promise once we get on that bus, we're gonna have a good laugh about all this.

SOLOMON	Drugs?  You gave me drugs?  I…thought this is what being drunk was like.

DIWATA	Hi, we'd like your finest suite near the Jacuzzi, please.

HOWIE	Okay.  Go right…right there. There you go.

SOLOMON	Oh, my gosh.  Why does my head feel so heavy?  Can you feel my head, please?  Feel it.

HOWIE	Let me get you some water.  You're gonna be okay.  Let me just…

SOLOMON	I can't believe you gave me drugs.  What kind of drug is this?  When is it gonna be over?

DIWATA	Okay, Solomon, I just texted your mom so she won't worry.
SUSAN	This is not our son.  Call Marie.

DIWATA	I can't believe all this stuff is included with the room.  Howie, free hot cocoa mix.  It's free.

HOWIE	Here you go, drink that.

SOLOMON	Is my head the same size as yours?

DIWATA	Crap.  Hi mom.

MARIE	I find that hard to believe.  His parents are already here at work.We'll you stay put, okay?  Okay.  Good bye.  They're in a hotel in Portland.  They're safe.  I just don't see why we need to rush there right now.  They're gonna be home first thing in the morning.

JAMES	kay.  It's all right.  I can go pick them up.

MARIE	I'll see if I can take off from work.  I have to drive Diwata's car home anyway.

SUSAN	I knew it.  I warned you this would happen if we put him in a public school, didn't I?I'll see you in the morning.

DIWATA	What are you thinking about Howie?

HOWIE	I'm thinking about all the hot guys you promised I was gonna meet at the competition.

DIWATA	And what are you thinking about Solomon?

SOLOMON	Abraham Lincoln.  When I was a kid, I got second place in the National Write and Illustrate Your Own Book Contest.  I wrote my book on him.

DIWATA	On Abraham Lincoln?

SOLOMON	As a teenager, I have such a deep respectfor Abraham Lincoln.  He was…

HOWIE	Okay, when I was in fifth grade, I entered that competition, and it wasn't national, it was just three school districts…

DIWATA	Okay, that's enough.  We're going to the Jacuzzi.

HOWIE	It's a pool.

DIWATA	It's water.  Howie, I've got a plan.  For our next tournament, we need to do group interpretation.

HOWIE	No, I'm done with Speech and Debate.

DIWATA	Group interpretation is what we should have done.  Next time, we'll compete togetherwith our own materials.  We're weaker on our own, but together…

SOLOMON	I'm quitting too.

DIWATA	Guys, don't get a bad attitude because we lost once.  Watch.

HOWIE	Want some?

DIWATA	Uh, no, not if there's alcohol in it.

HOWIE	Well, it's not non-alcoholic wine, Diwata.

DIWATA	I shouldn't then, I…until I'm into a good BFA program,I need to protect my singing voice, you know?

HOWIE	Oh.

DIWATA	Yeah, alcohol dries out the cords.

HOWIE	You know…someone who looks a lot like you was checking out the Family Planning Center across from the pizza shop I work at last week and…

DIWATA	I was just too scared to go in because I'm not sure I'm…I did one of those, like, home tests, and it was, like, kind of a line, maybe not.  I can't go to my family doctor, so I've got to go back there to get official results.

HOWIE	Do you have someone who'll go with you?

DIWATA	Most of my friends are older or from theatre camp, so…

DIWATA	You know, as long as we figure out the time difference issue, I think there's totally a way to integrate teenage Abraham Lincoln into The Crucible.  My Mary Warren Musical, I told you about it, right?  So, you have to tell me the story when you're sober,do not let me forget, okay?  Uh, hello, I put the sign on the door.

DIWATA	Mom.

MARIE	Don't say another word, you are on very thin ice.

JAMES	I smell vomit.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Is this a joke?  Nine hundred and thirty-seven dollars.

DIWATA	Hotels, food, expenses, the entrance fees were like a hundred each.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Pool, furniture repair. Your club was never even approved.  You don't even have a faculty advisor.

OKSANA	I supervise team.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Who?  Who the hell are…

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Who the hell is she?

OKSANA	I work in cafeteria for seven years.

SOLOMON	Sir, we never intended…

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	You all have parents on the school board.  What is wrong with you?  You're lucky that I don't suspend you all for fraudulently representing our school.  You all have two weeks of detention and no more clubs.

SOLOMON	What about the school newspaper?

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	You're joking, right?  Journalism relies on morals, ethics, and honesty.  There is no way that this school is gonna pay a dime towards these bills.

DIWATA	I have some money saved up.

HOWIE	Yeah, not enough to cover this.  My mother's broke Diwata.  It's gonna take me all summer to even put a dent in this.
SOLOMON	If I was running things, we would have at least followed the rules.

DIWATA	If you were running things, we never would have made it to Portland.

SOLOMON	Then I could similarly surmise that short people are stupider than taller people because you can't see as much as taller people and they have smaller brains…
MALE STUDENT	You ain't that tall either, Solomon.

MALE STUDENT	My brother is tall and he hates me.

JAMES	I'm not being…

SOLOMON	Using the speaker's logic…

JAMES	No, you can't just sit here… 

SOLOMON	…I'd argue that being short has a lot to do with how…

SUSAN	and keep continuing to have the same conversation.

SOLOMON	…doomed you are in life.

JAMES	Oh, please, don't bring on this up to me again.

WOMAN	Contestant 89, you were supposed to argue the opposition to your own prepared topic.

JAMES	I don't know what you want from me.

SUSAN	What are you talking…

WOMAN	Yes, I understand.

DIWATA	Relax, you look way to gay to be the father.  Plus, I used a fake name.

NURSE	Diwata Obama?
DIWATA	Is it weird we're celebrating my false alarm by giving me a food baby?  What, too soon?

HOWIE	Yeah, too soon--too soon.  You know, you're really lucky, right?

DIWATA	I know.  Especially, since that guy, Mark…a day after we did it, I called just to say, "Hey," or whatever and he was like, "I never would have slept with you if I wasn't so wasted,"so…

HOWIE	So, you guys are getting married?

DIWATA	Yup, it's a spring wedding.

HOWIE	I have a surprise for you.

DIWATA	How did you get that?

HOWIE	All the entries are archived in the library.  And yup, he won second place.  Prepare thyself.  Abraham was just 13 years old, but he already loved to read and learn.  One day, he decided to journey into townto the library and see what adventures he could find.  He read a book about the frontier and he built log cabin.  He read a book about the law and he became president.

MARIE	You didn't think I'd find out?

DIWATA	How did you?  They told you?

MARIE	Of course they told me, it's my credit card, Diwata.  And I am not busting my ass nights at the hospital for you to take my money and throw it in the street.

DIWATA	Yeah, well…sorry.

MARIE	It's not good enough, you forged a signature on the entry form.

DIWATA	Oksana works in the building.

MARIE	No theatre camp and you're going back to Olive Garden until this debt is paid off.  I already called them.

DIWATA	He didn't come to school today.

HOWIE	He'll survive.

DIWATA	Remember that show on MTV where the bully pulls the nerd's pants down,but the nerd's, you know, well-endowed so he becomes really popular?

HOWIE	Yeah.  So?

DIWATA	So, this is the opposite of that.  Solomon needs us.

HOWIE	I mean, I always knew you guys had a big house, but whoa.  We could play baseball out here.

DIWATA	Or do Shakespeare in the yard.  Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

SOLOMON	Have fun playing the nurse.

HOWIE	The lights are pretty.Did your mom put them up?

DIWATA	Where is mom?  Is she out banning some books?  Burning them?

SOLOMON	I think my parents are breaking up.  I don't even wanna finish school.

HOWIE	Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

SOLOMON	Why should I go back?  You even said I have no personality, I have no friends, and now…
DIWATA	I lost my virginity with my sweatshirt on.

HOWIE	What?

DIWATA	I feel bad, he looks like he's gonna kill himself, so I'm just saying.  No one knows that.  I was home on my mom's bed…

HOWIE	Oh, my God.

DIWATA	My pants were around my ankles.  I'm wearing this lame sweatshirt.  I…it was a hand-me down from my cousin and…I had to throw it away.  I couldn't look at it after it was over.  I could have at least had a nice one on.  I have a Champion sweatshirt I like.  Your turn.

HOWIE	Oh my God.  I…

DIWATA	Say something.

HOWIE	I'm in love with Diwata.  Um, okay.  Okay.  Um, before, in the car, I lied.  That dance, in scouts, to '"Freedom," I did teach the kids.  And I got up and I did it complete with all of these crazy, like…flaming moves.  And while I was dancing, the scout leaders, they were trying to hide that they were laughing, like, really laughing. And they were, like, shifting their weight, and--and coughing, but it was obvious.  And the guy that my mom was dating at the time, he actually stood up, stopped the music, and made me walk back to my seat.  I dropped out of the scouts because the kids started calling me "Miss Gay BSA."

DIWATA	BSA? Bathing suit areas?

HOWIE	No, idiot.

DIWATA	From stranger-danger?

HOWIE	Boy Scouts of America.

SUSAN	Solomon, you know you're grounded.  Get inside.

SOLOMON	Guys, I have to go.

JOHN	None of you have confessed?

ELIZABETH	There were many confessed.

JOHN	Who are they?

ELIZABETH	There'll be a hundred or more they say.

JOHN	And Giles?

ELIZABETH	Giles is dead.  They pressed him, John.
JOHN	Pressed?

ELIZABETH	Great stones they lay upon his chest until he plead aye or nay.  They say he give them but two words.  "More weight," he says then died.

GILES	More weight.

WOMAN	Add another stone.  Make him speak.

GILES	More weight.

WOMAN	Give us a name!

MARIE	Diwata, if you want dinner, I'm leaving now.

DIWATA	Mother please die, so you will be dead.  I hate eating where I work, it's embarrassing.
MARIE	Well, we get a discount here, I'm not loaded, you know?

DIWATA	I know, I know.  But everyone here knows me, like, everyone's gonna wanna stop and talk to me.

WAITRESS	Diwata.

MARIE	Did you hear?  Our local nutcase is a star on YouTube now.  He screamed at us at board meetings and suddenly he's a star with a fan base.

DIWATA	Seriously?  A lot of people?

MARIE	Yeah.  It's, like, 50,000 hits.  Oh, there's James.  Is he by himself? Should we invite him to join us?

DIWATA	What?  No.

MARIE	Should we?  We should.

DIWATA	Mom, no.  Please don't.

MARIE	We should.  We should.

DIWATA	No.

MARIE	James, come here.

DIWATA	James, how's Solomon doing?

JAMES	He'll come around.  He's just going through a rough spot for him right now.

DIWATA	So, you don't know.

MARIE	Diwata.

JAMES	No, it's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's fine.

JAMES	Being an adult doesn't mean that you suddenly have the answers to everything.  What do you think I should tell him?

DIWATA	Uh, that you love him?  Start there.  I'm gonna be such a better parent than you guys, just FYI.

MARIE	Could you excuse us for a second?

MARIE	Diwata, could…

DIWATA	What?

MARIE	Do you think my life is easy?  That I enjoy eating at the restaurantwhere my daughter works?

DIWATA	Mom.

MARIE	No, no, no, no, you're an adult.  We're on a first name basis.  You call me Marie.

DIWATA	No, I don't want to.

MARIE	Then let me be your mother.  Please.  Please you have to respect me.  And you need to stop floating through your life like none of this is real because everything I did at your age is what my life is now.Okay?

DIWATA	Okay.  Sorry.

MARIE	Okay.

DIWATA	I'm sorry.

MARIE	I'm sorry too.  Oh.  Oh, no.

DIWATA	When the world turns against you and you cannot go on.  When your pants get pulled down and you'd rather have them on.  When got zero friends and you can't get a date, tell your pant-pullersbring it on.

GILES	More weight.

DIWATA	When your town is closed-minded and the others get their way.  So, you dye your hair blonde and you dance like a lady.  When you wanted the lead because of crap you must wait, tell those crap-heapers, heap it on.

GILES	More weight.

DIWATA	Lay it on.
GILES	More weight.

DIWATA	Until I'm gone.

GILES	More weight.

DIWATA	Bitch, sit on my chest with heavy piles of hate.

GILES	More weight.

GARY	What do you want?

DIWATA	I want, um, I want your advice.

GARY	Go away.

DIWATA	I--I just wanna talk to you.

GARY	You're on my property.  You've been formally warned.  Go away.
DIWATA	I'll fix your pothole?

GARY	Come in.  What do you want?

DIWATA	Uh, well, you're a really big star on YouTube.

GARY	That's my sister's doing.  I don't use electricity anymore.  They can track it backwards now.  So, what do you want?

DIWATA	I screwed up a lot of stuff and--and now I don't know what to do.  No one will listen to me.How do you get people to listen to you?  And now, I mean, they love you.

GARY	Oh, you know, getting people to listen to you is kind of the opposite of getting people to like you.  You know, they tell me to stick to it your two minutes, I remind them I'm gonna speak until I'm done speaking.  They can arrest me.  I'm using their stage for my needs, not theirs, my terms.  Life is a stage.
DIWATA	Life is a stage.

GARY	What are you doing here?  I mean, somebody sent you here to spy on me?

DIWATA	Oh, no.

GARY	No?

DIWATA	But, um, uh, thank you very much for your time.

GARY	Come here.

SOLOMON	Oh.  Are you insane?  I'm grounded.  You can't be here.
DIWATA	Howie's here too.  Life is a stage.

SOLOMON	What?

DIWATA	We're in detention forever; we can't be in the clubs or the play or newspapers, but school board meetings all have an open mic portion.

HOWIE	Diwata's right.  We're letting them shut us up.

DIWATA	We, kind of, came up with this thing.

HOWIE	Okay.  So, at the meetings they have to let us say whatever we want.  Why don't we do it in a way that they won't forget?

DIWATA	Honestly what do you have to lose?
SUSAN	What--what on earth?  What are all these newscasters doing here?

SOLOMON	Nice turnout.

DIWATA	Told you I got my peeps.  Custodial staffs love me, just FYI.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	We are very proud to have Salem County's Crimson Tides to lead today in the Pledge of Allegiance.

LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM	I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of Americaand to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation, under God indivisible, with Liberty and Justice all.

MAN	…Indivisible…

SUSAN	…Liberty…

JAMES	…and Justice for all.

OKSANA	…for Paul.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	How about those Tides.  Well, welcome all of you. North Salem School Board Meeting No. 250

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	I'm not sure we--why we have such a full house tonight, but--nor am I clear who contacted the A.C.L.U.  I just want to assure everyone that nothing gets decided without hearing any of the community's concerns. Tonight's meeting is gonna be an open and fair one in which everyone will have the chance to speak.  However, as per long standing town bylaws, the press will not be able to report or film inside.  There are exits on the both sides of the back or the room.
SOLOMON	What's the point of humiliating ourselves if nobody is gonna even see it?

DIWATA	We've still got one incognito camera.  All we need is one.

WOMAN	You banned my brother but you can't stop the flood, Bellingham.  Guess what?  The city called, they want their First Amendment rights back.  And who's with me, A.C.L.U.?

WOMAN	Yeah.

WOMAN	Well, I'm a small independent nation with a great big army.  No, no, no, no.  Oh.  Get off of me.
PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	I appreciate diversity but not hoodlum antics will not be tolerated.  That's just against the law.

WOMAN	Say, how do you do, big kids.

MAN	Boo.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Guys, this isn't the first time we've had this.

SOLOMON	I got a bad feeling about this

DIWATA	That's what you said about the Portland trip and that was amazing.

HOWIE	Portland was a hellish experience.

DIWATA	Well, yeah, Portland was the worst day of our lives.  But, just stay calm.

PRINCIPAL BELLINGHAM	Everyone must stickto their three-minute open mic.  This is for your own benefit, so everyone gets the chance to speak.  Okay?  And with that said, that first of the open mic is Diwata Jones.

DIWATA	Hi, I'm Diwata Jones.  Though some of you might know me as Sister Bertha from sophomore year's production of The Sound of Music. Before me is the set for Once Upon a Mattress.  Sadly, I will not be participating in this year's show due to miscasting.  As disturbing as that news has been to a lot of people in the community, I'm grateful it's led me to an amazing new group of people here at North Salem.  I recently became part of the newly formed Speech and Debate team.  The first team in the school's historyto almost make it to octo-finals at the highly prestigious Portland Invitational.  And now, with my remaining two minutes, I'd like to show you our team's work to prove that the school should support, metaphorically and financially our worthwhile endeavor.  Arnie, lights.

DIWATA	Where am I?  I must have fallen through a wormhole and travelled back in time.  But to when?  And to where?  Boy, what you doing?  Boy, what you thinking?  Boy, what's your name?

HOWIE	It's Abraham Lincoln.

DIWATA	I've landed in a land that's strange and foreign.

HOWIE	Girl, tell me your name.

DIWATA	It's Mary Warren.  Boy, this is Salem.  I just had my trial. They think I'm a witch.  They think I'm vile.  They said, "Girl, you'll hang.  You must confess."  So, I lied.  I said, "Yes, I am possessed."

HOWIE	You held it in.

DIWATA	I held it in.

HOWIE	But Mary, you lied.

DIWATA	I held it in.

HOWIE	Don't you feel awful.

DIWATA	Yes, but I'm alive.  This girl is headstrong.  If I lied in court but what the heck, I lost my honor.  Not my neck.

HOWIE	Today is a tough day for me.  I was just on my way to have a talk with my parents.

DIWATA	What kind of talk, Abraham?

HOWIE	Oh, you know.  I just wanted to share with them that I'm a little different.  That I love them, but I also love the way the army men look in and out of their uniforms.
DIWATA	Wow.  Too bad there's no place for you to share your feelings.  Why don't you join the Recycling Club?  You don't have to talk about what's on your mind when you can recycle.  Do you want my advice, Abraham?

HOWIE	Yes, Mary Warren.

DIWATA	Hold it in.

HOWIE	I wanna share my feelings.

DIWATA	No, don't be obscene.  Just hold it in.

HOWIE	But my voice matters.

DIWATA	Not if you're a teen. Follow your feelings.  Don't you wanna run the country someday?

HOWIE	Yes.  You think I can do it?

DIWATA	Not if you're gay.

HOWIE	Mary, speaking my mind is not a sin.

DIWATA	Trust me, I'm a Puritan.  Hold it in.

HOWIE	Yeah.

DIWATA	Your feelings inside.  Just hold it in.

HOWIE	Girl, I can't lie.

DIWATA	Just swallow your pride. Please don't riff.

HOWIE	If I hold it in, I'll lose my bravery.

DIWATA	If you hold it in you will end slavery.  You win.

HOWIE	I win.

HOWIE	If I hold it in.

DIWATA	If you hold it in.

DIWATA	Yeah.

SOLOMON	Two teenagers, lost, separated by different times, yet united in their quest to speak their minds. Far-fetched?  Perhaps.  But far from true?  Far from it.  Teenagers today are holding lots of things inside.  Like feelings, fears, and fetuses.  But by keeping these things hidden inside, who are kids really helping?  Themselves or the adults who would rather ignore these subjects than to engage them?  After all, do we live in Salem, Oregon, or Salem, Massachusetts circa 1692?  Puritanism seems to be alive and well in Salem.  So I ask, would Mary Warren's naked forest-dancing be any more welcome today?  Let's finds out.

DIWATA	Arnie.

SINGER	I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy.  And I guess it was enough for me.  I think there's something you should know.  I think it's time I told you so.  There's something deep inside of me.  There's someone else I've got to be.

DIWATA	Featured ensemble my ass.

SINGER	Take back your picture in a frame.  Take back your singing in the rain.  I just hope you understand.  Sometimes the clothes do not make the man.  All we have to do now.  Is take these lies and make them true somehow.  All we have to see.  Is that I don't belong to you and you don't belong to me, yeah, yeah.  Freedom.  Freedom.  Freedom.  You've gotta give for what you take.  Freedom.  Freedom.  Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take.  Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy.  What a kick just a buddy and me.  What a kick just a buddy and me.

DIWATA	We aren't leaving until we have a GSA.  We won't rest until Mary Rogers' real lines are put back in the school play.  We won't stop until the newspaper can write about issues that actual concern the student body.  We won't stop until people are held accountable for their actions.  Try and stop us.	You can't possibly stop us from…

MAN	What's going on?

FEMALE STUDENT	I saw your video online.  You were awesome.

SOLOMON	Thanks.

DETENTION TEACHER	Shhh.

DIWATA	Oksana recorded it on her Razor, so the quality's shit but 84 views.  We might go viral, people.

SOLOMON	Can I see please?

DIWATA	If those 84 people tell their friends, who tell their friends.  I say we monetize my YouTube account instantly. I'm serious.

RACHEL	Hey.

HOWIE	Guys, look.

RACHEL	Hey.  Are you guys students here?

HOWIE	Yeah.

RACHEL	We've been hearing there have been some issues with teachers, censorship and a play was rewritten without the author's permission?  Do you guys know anything about that?

HOWIE	Yeah.  This is your guy.  He'll tell you everything you need to know.

RACHEL	Okay.
SOLOMON	Hey, I'm Solomon.  I used to work for the school newspaper.

RACHEL	Rachel.  Nice to meet you.  So, do you like working for school paper?

SOLOMON	Uh, there's something else.  Um, well, I started when I was a sophomore.

HOWIE	What?

DIWATA	What?

HOWIE	No, this has got to be a joke.
DIWATA	What?  What?  Accept it.

HOWIE	No.  I don't even know…

DIWATA	You didn't realize he was into you?

HOWIE	No.

DIWATA	And you--what about gaydar?

HOWIE	It was turned off.  I was too nervous.  This is crazy.  No.

DIWATA	What?

HOWIE	He says, he wants to go out on a date.

DIWATA	Oh my God. That is amazing.

SOLOMON	They told me I couldn't have a point of view about my own school, I had to report on topics that were already decided on and that's the opposite of reporting.  But the newspaper, the arts, our clubs…

DIWATA	Look.  That's him.  That's him.

SOLOMON	…those are our forums to investigate what's important to our lives.  But all these things, they were just the symptoms of the larger problem.  No one was listening to us.

RACHEL	Well, Solomon, we're on air, and you're talking to five million people.  I promise someone is listening now.

SOLOMON	Well, it all started with the pothole.

SINGER	So, this next song is written by one of my super fans, uh, her name is Diwata Jones.  I thought I'd sing it and send some love back her way since she loves everything I post on Twitter.  Here we go.  Boys don't seem to like me for who I am.  I'm not good at romancing.  Others please the men by acting like their witches and doing naked forest dancing.I know a girl who's good at singing like a dying squirrel.  And an elder who still wants to choose her but even when we feel like we are losing out, that doesn't make us losers because I'm flying free when I am me, when you are you, when we are we.  We're flying free if we are free, so you'll be you and I'll be me.  Together, together, our good times are just beginning.  When you try your best and you are the best.  You're a loser who is winning.  And sometimes others think that different is bad.  They're scared, unwilling to wager.  Sometimes judgy people just don't understand, but who you are is how God made you.  Even when the bad guys pull ahead, we're fighting for survival.  The race is long, we won't give up even when we don't make the finals because I'm flying free when I am me, when you are you, when we are we.  We're flying free if we are free, so you'll be you and I'll be me.  Together, together.  Some girls will always be thinner.  If we try our best and we are the best.  This loser is a winner.Just be yourself and you come in first, even if the world thinks you are the worst, the worst.  I'm flying free when I am me, when you are you, when we are we.  We're flying free if we are free, so you'll be you and I'll be me.  Together, together, our good times are just beginning if we try our best then we are the best.  Just be yourself and forget the past.  Love your weirdo self through thick and thin.  If you love yourself then you'll always win.  You win.  Oh.  Together, whoa, together, our good times are just beginning if we try our best then we are the best. We're losers who are winning.  We are winning.  Yeah.  We're winning.  Yeah.  Yeah.

CASEY	How do you solve a problem like Maria?  How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?  How do you find the word that means Maria?  A flibbertigibbet-a will…

DIWATA	A clown.Where am I?  I must have fallen through a wormhole and travelled back in time.

HOWIE	If I hold it in, I'll lose my bravery.

DIWATA	If you hold it in, you will end slavery.  You win.

HOWIE	I win.

HOWIE	If I hold it in.

DIWATA	If you hold it in.

DIWATA	Yeah.
