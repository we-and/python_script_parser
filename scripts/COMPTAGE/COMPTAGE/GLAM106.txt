CRYSTAL	...unfairness is the true secret to success. That’s why we are the most popular girls at school!

CRYSTAL	My dear little sister, we don’t need anyone... 

ELECTRA	Finished: what do you think?

CRYSTAL	You know, little sister, it’s so ‘dark’ it even horrifies me...

ELECTRA	Thanks little sister, I am pleased with it, too. And yours, on the other hand?

CRYSTAL	Here...oh..gosh!

ELECTRA	Little sister? You’re in trouble. In big trouble...

CRYSTAL	To succeed in my field you also need to know how to be, I don’t know how to explain it...know how to be... smart! 

CRYSTAL	Life is hard.. those who don’t wake themselves up stay ‘on the bench’! (laughs)

CRYSTAL	You definitely need to rough up your style a little bit...

ELECTRA	Oh no! Our suite has been turned upside down! The little bag is bewitched, heeeelp!

CRYSTAL	Noo! My assignment....

VAN LINDEN	Where is your bag, Miss Carmen?

CARMEN	Here it is: my flying bag!

VAN LINDEN	-Mmm very good, but I would like a bit of composure, Miss Carmen...

VAN LINDEN	And your bag, Miss Crystal?

CRYSTAL	Ok, I admit it, this time it didn’t go as I had hoped, but it doesn’t end here...

ELECTRA	...we’ll get our revenge!
