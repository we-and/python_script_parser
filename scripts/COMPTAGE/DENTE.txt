	(CHRISTMAS ROMANCE AL DENTE)



NATALIE	Ooh. Natalie Rogers, events planning. Yes, Mrs. Miller. I confirmed the venue this morning. You're all set for your Christmas party. Natalie Rogers, travel consultant. Hey, Mr. Walker, how were your flights? I'm so glad.
	Yeah, you know, you can always string some lights around a palm tree and call it Christmas. Natalie Rogers, custom gift-wrapping. Yes, I will be dropping those off in about 15 minutes. Mr. Ortiz! I finished the wreath for your food truck. Even if the weather is frightful, the chilies will keep you warm. Look.

MR. ORTIZ	Muchas gracias.

NATALIE	Wendy!

WENDY	Oh!

NATALIE	Christmas cards, addressed and stamped.

WENDY	Oh, I—

NATALIE	Pop them in the mail and the let the mailman do the rest.

WENDY	Thank you so much, they're beautiful. Oh, I love hand-addressed cards, but with my penmanship no one would get them until July.

NATALIE	Well, I threw in a couple of extra for Joshy and Becca direct from the North Pole.

WENDY	They'll be thrilled, thank you so much.

NATALIE	You're welcome.

WENDY	Merry Christmas.

NATALIE	Merry Christmas, Wendy. Yeah, took a little creativity but you know I love a challenge, Merry Christmas.

GIRL	Natalie, Sparky would be so glad to see you. Come here. Sparky, your favorite sitter is here.

NATALIE	Hello, handsome. And these clothes.

GIRL	Who doesn't love to get all dressed up for the holidays? We want to take him on a Christmas cruise, but he gets terrible sea-sickness.

NATALIE	Well, I am happy to. We are gonna have a great time! We're gonna watch It's a Wonderful Woof, and lap up eggnog, and sing Christmas carols. See, he already knows the opening to Jingle Bells.

GIRL	You're the best pet-sitter anywhere we've ever had.

NATALIE	Thank you.

GIRL'S MOM	Natalie, thank you so much for doing this.

NATALIE	Of course.

GIRL'S MOM	Are you sure I can't convince you to come work for me?

NATALIE	Thank you, but I already have a job.

GIRL'S MOM	You have eight jobs. That was just the last time I counted.

NATALIE	May have added one or two since then. But why can't I since I'm the jack of all trades.

GIRL'S MOM	When are you gonna settle down on one career?

NATALIE	I don't know, but I figure when I find the perfect thing, I'll know it. And until then I'm happy as I am.

GIRL'S MOM	Well, I hope you're not still waiting on the perfect thing to do for Christmas.

NATALIE	Thank you, but I'm gonna spend Christmas with my cousin Olivia. I should probably get going. Miles to go before I sleep or at least a few more blocks.

GIRL	Be a good doggie, okay. Merry Christmas.

NATALIE & GIRL'S MOM	Merry Christmas.

NATALIE	Let's go, Sparky.

GIRL'S MOM	Bye, Sparky.

GIRL	Bye.

NATALIE	Natalie Rogers, custom wreaths or um, travel consultant.

OLIVIA 	Hi, it's Olivia.

NATALIE	Olivia. I was just talking about you. Are you back from Rome yet?

OLIVIA 	No, I am not back from Rome. Uh, I guess you haven't been following the news, have you? It's the big chill, the new Ice Age.

NATALIE	What are you talking about?

OLIVIA	I'm stranded here.

NATALIE	Oh no.

OLIVIA	Yeah, looks like I won't be home for Christmas, I'm so sorry.

NATALIE	It's okay, it's um-- I'll miss you, but don't worry about me, lots of friends have offered to spend their Christmases with me. But are you okay?

OLIVIA	Yeah, but I wanted to kinda keep this as a surprise, you know how I've been wanting to open my restaurant for years. Well, I finally convinced Chef Grimaldi to come over to Pine Valley and be my partner.

NATALIE	I remember him from when you took me to Italy when I was little girl. I always thought he looked just like Santa Claus.

OLIVIA	Oh, uh, so my plan was to open on Christmas Eve with a big traditional feast of Natale. You know how it is in small towns, nothing is ever open on Christmas and there's always a few people with no place to go.

NATALIE	No one should be alone on Christmas.

OLIVIA 	Yeah, I feel terrible. We already had a handful of reservations I'm gonna have to cancel, there's no way Chef Grimaldi can do it on his own.

NATALIE	Oh, I'm so sorry.

OLIVIA	Yeah, me too. Well, I wanted to let you know, Merry Christmas.

NATALIE	Merry Christmas, Olivia. Problems are just opportunities in work clothes. Hi, Mrs. Myers. This is Natalie Rogers, Olivia's cousin. I have an idea. What do you know about this restaurant she's planning on opening? Come here. Come on. Alright. Olivia always was an optimist. Chef Rivaldi? You stay here.
	All dogs might go to heaven but they should probably stay out of restaurant kitchens. Stop right there, you--Ow!

STEFANO	(Speaking Italian)

NATALIE	No, don't, let me go! Oh, that's so much better.

STEFANO	Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

NATALIE	What?

STEFANO	Are you hurt?

NATALIE	No, no. No. I-- I think it's fine.

STEFANO	Now get outta my kitchen, presto.

NATALIE	Your kitchen, this is my cousin Olivia's kitchen.

STEFANO	So Olivia is your cousin?
	The restaurant may be hers, but the kitchen always belongs to the chef.

NATALIE	You can't be Chef Grimaldi. You're nothing like Santa Claus.
	

STEFANO	Oh, you're thinking of my uncle, Zio Lorenzo Grimaldi. Maybe I just look like my (Speaks Italian) But he was too old to come to America, so I came instead. Sorry, I'm his nephew Stefano Grimaldi.

NATALIE	Ow.

STEFANO	Uh, sorry. Uh, I don't know the name of you.

NATALIE	I'm Natalie Rogers. Olivia's cousin.

STEFANO	Oh, I should've known.
	See Olivia told me her cousin was la bella signorina.
	
NATALIE	Oh, that's very nice of her.

STEFANO	Oh, and it's very true.
	But what were you doing uh, sneaking around my kitchen?

NATALIE	I wasn't sneaking.

STEFANO	Then that's not the word for it, the sneaking and creeping.

NATALIE	No, I wasn't doing any of those things, I was just looking for the chef.

MRS. MYERS	Yoohoo! Is anybody here?

NATALIE	Mrs. Myers. Thanks for coming. Have you met my cousin's best friend? This is Mrs. Anna Myers.

MRS. MYERS	Stefano!

NATALIE	Oh, I see you have. And another one. What third time's not a charm?

MRS. MYERS	Stefano's quite charming enough.
	And who is this?

NATALIE	Sparky. I'm pet-sitting for the holidays.

STEFANO	Well, it was nice to see you, huh. And to meet you, Sparky. But I must go otherwise my sauce, huh, it will burn if I don't get back.

NATALIE	Oh, I just need to talk to you.

STEFANO	No! A chef will never let his food burn. Not for anything. Mamma mia. Basta.

NATALIE	Well, fine then.

MRS. MYERS	I brought your cousin's spare keys, I'm sure she won't mind if you stay in her house while you're here in town.

NATALIE	Thank you. I really wanna go through with the grand opening just as planned.
	
MRS. MYERS	Well, there's a lot of work to be done.

NATALIE	Every problem is an opportunity in disguise.

MRS. MYERS	If you insist. Well, let's get you settled in and I'll tell you what I know of her plans. Unless I was interrupting something.

NATALIE	What? No.

MRS. MYERS	He's a very handsome man.

NATALIE	He's a very grumpy man. He yelled at me in Italian. And he doesn't even look like Santa Claus.
	
NATALIE	What a cute store.

MRS. MYERS	I know, lovely. So nice. You know, Olivia asked me to cancel all of the Christmas reservations but if you're really serious—

NATALIE 	You bet I'm serious. Olivia didn't wanna let anyone down on Christmas and neither do I.

MRS. MYERS	Beebee, hello!

BEEBEE	Hi, Mrs. Myers.

MRS. MYERS	Beebee's one of my students. This is my good friend's cousin, Natalie.
	How are you doing, Beebee?

BEEBEE	Uh, not's so good. I was hoping to get some temp work in over vacation, but it seems like everyone in town has already hired the holiday help.

MRS. MYERS	Too bad. I'll keep an ear out.

BEEBEE	Thanks, Mrs. Myers. It was nice to meet you, Ms. Natalie.

MRS. MYERS	Oh, there's someone you should know, Miles Croaker, he's our town culture vulture.

NATALIE 	Culture vulture?

MRS. MYERS	You know, he oversees all the town events, concerts and reviews everything from the high school musical to the local restaurants for the paper.

NATALIE	Restaurant reviews, huh.

MRS. MYERS	He's tough, but fair and very well-respected. He can make it work for anyone in this town.

MILES	Phew.

MRS. MYERS	Miles, dear, what's the matter? I haven't seen you this distraught since the fizzing fireworks fiasco of '09.

MILES	Oh, it's this Roman snow-blow.

NATALIE	Oh, the blizzard that hit Rome.
	Yeah, my cousin's stuck there for Christmas.

MILES	Oh, this storm's has wreaked havoc on air travel all over the world.
	And in-- in Christmas. Oh, our touring carolers just heard that flights home are canceled and can't be rescheduled until after the holiday.

MRS. MYERS	It's terrible to be away from home on Christmas.

MILES	Hmm, yes, I was hoping they'd be able to celebrate in the café, it's closed on Christmas.

NATALIE	Are most places closed then?

MILES	Yes, all of them. Our poor carollers aren't just stranded without their loved ones, but must also eat microwave turkey dinners.

NATALIE	Ew.

MRS. MYERS	Mm-mm.

MILES	Can you please excuse me I must call my travel agents again and see if there's anything they can do.

MRS. MYERS	Those poor carolers. I don't suppose you can do anything for their travel agent front?

NATALIE	I already tried for my cousin Olivia, everything's locked up. It looks so beautiful.
	
MRS. MYERS	You know Olivia, she always has to set up her decorations right after Thanksgiving that way Christmas can last as long as possible. You know she'd be here if she could.

NATALIE	Yeah. I know. I just can't remember the last time I celebrated Christmas without her. Oh, do you wanna stay for dinner?

MRS. MYERS	Of course. I'm sure you can find something in the freezer to cook.
	
NATALIE	Cook?


MRS. MYERS	You did just wanna have a grand restaurant opening, right?
	
NATALIE	Yeah, I just didn't think I would be the one cooking.

MRS. MYERS	I better take this. Go ahead, make yourself at home. Hey.

NATALIE	Okay, cook. Lasagne. The dishwasher, this is the oven? Okay. I tried that one. Okay. Back to planning Pezzo Di Parma. Who could that be? Stefano.

STEFANO	Ciao, Natalie. Uh, I made a sauce but uh, now there is no one to eat it, so I thought maybe if you don't have any plans for dinner, you can have it. And some bone for the cagnolino.

NATALIE	Doggie bag for the doggie that's very thoughtful, thank you.

STEFANO	Prego.

NATALIE	Oh, do you wanna come in and join us for dinner?
	There's gotta be plenty.

STEFANO	Are you sure?

NATALIE	Yeah, I was just making a lasa--
	Oh no, the lasagne.

STEFANO	Oh.

NATALIE	Ooh, no!
	
STEFANO	Oh!

NATALIE	Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

STEFANO	(Speaking Italian)

MRS. MYERS	What in the world is going on here?

NATALIE	I was just thawing the lasagne and then I got uh, distracted researching for the grand opening and I guess I just forgot.

STEFANO	Forgot? Forgot. Do you forget to breathe? Does your heart forget to pump?
	How can you be cooking and forget?

NATALIE	I'm not much of a cook. But I found so many wonderful ideas, I didn't realize how elaborate the feast of Natale is. There's a beautiful celebration and everybody comes together for a big Christmas meal that lasts for hours and hours with um, antipasto, and salad, and meats, and sweetbreads.

STEFANO	Mhmm.

NATALIE	And candied nuts, and wine and music. I thought we could decorate the whole place like a Tuscan villa but with Christmas touches like a--Mm. Mmm.

MRS. MYERS	Looks like your mystery pasta worked its magic again.
	(Chuckles)

NATALIE	It's so... There's parsley and oregano. What else?

STEFANO	It will be la specialità Italia de casa when we finally open Pezzo Di Parma.
	If we ever open. Madame.

NATALIE	Of course, you're gonna open. And just in time. Just in time for Christmas.

STEFANO	What?

NATALIE	Yeah, like you and Olivia planned.

STEFANO	No, it's impossible. We have three days until Christmas, we-- we- we-- we have nothing prepared, we have no staff, no-- no decoration. No food prepared, it's impossible.

NATALIE	No, I have a lot of really good ideas, if I—

MRS. MYERS	Stefano's right, Natalie. It's a lovely idea, but we don't have enough time to get it done.

STEFANO	It's okay.

NATALIE	Maybe you're right. Is it coriander? Fennel? Oh, come on, you have to tell me.

STEFANO	If I tell you, it will not be a mystery sauce anymore, right?

NATALIE	But please. Turmeric? Paprika?
	
STEFANO	Na-- Natalie, the thing to guess is the--a little bit in the cook. Unlike your lasagne. Capito. Natalie, good morning.

NATALIE	Morning.

STEFANO	I fancy you're gonna need our reservation book?

NATALIE	I better get started on those cancelations.

STEFANO	Hmm.

NATALIE	Mr. Croaker, good morning!

MILES	Well, good morning. I heard a rumor that your cousin's restaurant might be open for Christmas and I thought I'd come to see for myself.

NATALIE	I'm afraid that's just a rumor.

MILES	Oh, well, worth a try. Oh, uh, sorry, my dear. This is Ariella Cancio, one of our touring carolers.

ARIELLA	Hello.

STEFANO	Buongiorno.
	
ARIELLA	(Speaking Italian) Oh uh, I'm so sorry, I forget my manners.
	Um, I was just saying it is sad this year, so many of us have nowhere to go but um, meeting someone from the same part of Italia it's a little bit of home.

MILES	I'm afraid it is sad, but uh, there's no way around it.

STEFANO	Uh, sorry, we don't—

NATALIE	Yes, there is. Just a tiny change of plans. Mr. Croaker, Ristorante Pezzo Di Parma would be proud to host you and all of the carolers for a bi traditional feast of Natale dinner on Christmas.

MILES	Oh, well, thank you.

ARIELLE	Grazie mille. Ci vediamo.

STEFANO	Ci vediamo. Are you kidding? Or do you wanna make the pasta? Do you wanna make the pizza? What are you gonna do, huh? Pazza. Pazzo.

NATALIE	Oh, but I can help.

STEFANO	Oh my God!

NATALIE	It's gonna be fine.

STEFANO	Woman making me crazy, eh. Tried to tell you it's impossible, but you don't listen, huh.

NATALIE	Well?

STEFANO	Impossibile, impossibile.

NATALIE	There's always a way.

STEFANO	No, it will be a fiasco. And that is—

NATALIE	It's the same word in English and it will not be a fiasco, there is always a way.

STEFANO	Sometime there is no-- there is no way. Sometime there is a wall, there's just a big wall and no ladder, capisce?

NATALIE	Big wall or small, the best way to get over it is to start climbing.
	
STEFANO	Maybe you are crazy.

NATALIE	If we can pull this off-- your mystery sauce alone is worth a five-star review.

STEFANO	Reviews are important. Many, many restaurant in America they fail because of it, I understand. But I thought, I thought I would have more time to plan, to make everything perfect.

NATALIE	It will be perfect. And it will be a beautiful feast of Natale for a bunch of people that have nowhere else to go.
	
STEFANO	I will get my recipes. Plan the menu.

NATALIE	Great. What should I do?

STEFANO	You? You look for a rope.  Even if can get up that wall, Natalie, we still need a way down.

NATALIE	Okay, read me the list again.

BEEBEE	Décor, so all this. Food.

NATALIE	Oh, that's Stefano's department. Believe me, you do not want me doing the cooking.

BEEBEE	Menus.

NATALIE	I can do those. Beautiful handwritten menus will be great, right?

BEEBEE	Yeah. Staffing.

NATALIE	Staffing. Well, we aren't gonna have a formal service for just five, but we're definitely gonna need some help now even going family style. Who do you think we can get this close to Christmas?

BEEBEE	Well, there's this guy in my class. Tyler. But I don't know him that well.

NATALIE	Oh, then what makes you think—

BEEBEE	Well, his cousin Melissa told me that his folks were going out of town, he was supposed to join them once school was out, but then I heard from Joanna that all the flights were canceled due to the snowstorm in Italy.
	And last year he was helping stock shelves at the hardware store, but then I heard from Carol that he didn't take the job this year, 'cause he didn't think he'd be around.

NATALIE	But you don't know him very well?

BEEBEE	Not really.

NATALIE	This Tyler, he's um pretty cute, huh?

BEEBEE	Yeah. I mean I guess, I never really paid attention all that much.

NATALIE	Does he have curly brown hair?

BEEBEE	Mhmm, I mean I-- I don't know him that well.

NATALIE	And warm puppy dog eyes?

BEEBEE	Yeah. How did you know that?

NATALIE	Um, because there's a cute boy with curly brown hair over there pretending not to notice you for the last 10 minutes.

BEEBEE	Where? What, no, no don't-- don't point. Please tell me he didn't see me.

NATALIE	I think he sounds like a great candidate. Why don't you go offer him the job?

BEEBEE	I can't do that. You should be the one to do that.

NATALIE	As my assistant, I'm delegating the task to you.

BEEBEE 	No, but I wouldn't even know what to say.

NATALIE	You'll be fine, go on, I'll help you.

BEEBEE	Please, no.

NATALIE	I'll help you.

BEEBEE	Tyler! Hi, it's Beebee. Jordan. From school. You know?

TYLER	Oh, Beebee, hi, uh...Yo, what's uh, what's up? I'm so sorry, uh... What's up?

BEEBEE	Not much. How are you?

TYLER	I'm cool. What's that?

BEEBEE	No. Just some-- just some reindeer went by, you know, no big deal.

TYLER	Reindeer, right.

BEEBEE	Oh, I was wondering if you wanted a job for the holidays? You'd be working with me. Not every second. Just sometimes. Only when we had to.

TYLER	Uh, well, schp-- sch-- sure. Yeah, that's be cool. What's the—

BEEBEE	Cool.

TYLER	What's the job?

BEEBEE	What is it? Miming.

TYLER	Miming, uh, I-- I-- I don't—

BEEBEE	Serving food in a restaurant.

TYLER	That yes, that I can do. Yeah.

BEEBEE	Good, 'cause there's also drumming.

TYLER	Um.

BEEBEE	Cooking! Cooking, helping cook in the kitchen.

TYLER	I'd like to cook.

BEEBEE	Good.

TYLER	Yeah.

BEEBEE	'Cause there also might be s--You know what, here's my boss Ms. Natalie right now.

NATALIE	Hey, Tyler.

TYLER	Hi.

NATALIE	Beebee's told me a lot about you even though she doesn't know you very well.

TYLER	Uh.

NATALIE	I think if you're interested in the job, you'd be a great fit.

TYLER	It sounds great.

NATALIE	Great um, why don't you head on over to Pezzo Di Parma, I'll let Stefano know you're on your way.

TYLER	Thanks, Ms. Natalie, uh thank you. Um, thanks Beebee. I'll uh, I'll see you later.
	
STEFANO	Andiamo, Tyler. Dry storage and cold storage, prepping area. Prepping area.
	Hot line, cold line, plating area. Capito?

TYLER	Yeah.

STEFANO	Love, life, and cooking is all the same. It's logical. I'm looking at your face and I see you don't understand.

TYLER	Uh, no, no, I get that cooking has to be logical, but love?

STEFANO	Okay, I will use myself as an example. Tyler, I already know the woman I will fall in love with.

TYLER	How can you know that?

STEFANO	Logic. I know it will be someone who will help me raise our children to speak Italian, who wants to live where I live, and love cooking as much as I do. So we can share same passion, pasta.

TYLER	Okay, but what about you know, attraction?

STEFANO	Ah, you want a bella signorina, of course. But not every bella signorina is the right bella signorina for you. That why you need logic.

TYLER	Wow, I haven't even thought about what I want.

NATALIE	Hello?

STEFANO	Ah.

NATALIE	We're back. We brought enough stuff to deck the halls.

STEFANO	Oi.

NATALIE	Not to mention the dining room. Entryway and even you. Hmm, that smells delicious. And we are starving.

STEFANO	Good. Then you must eat, it's almost finished.

NATALIE	Is that the mystery sauce?

STEFANO	Ah.

NATALIE	Did you see what he put in it?

TYLER	Oh, there was some--There was some green stuff, and some chopped stuff, and uh, some other stuff.

NATALIE	Maybe if I eat out of the pan, I'll get the mystery ingredient.

STEFANO	Nah! Scusi.

NATALIE	Hmm. Little bit sweet and a little bit tangy and just a tiny bit bitter, but in a good way like...

STEFANO	Si.

NATALIE	Ginger. The mystery ingredient is ginger, right? Tell me I'm right. Or maybe thyme.

STEFANO	If I told you...

NATALIE	It wouldn't be a mystery. What? It doesn't have thyme, but it needs it, right?

STEFANO	How could you give me advice on the pompieri, the firefighter, they must put the boots on when they are coming over, hmm?

NATALIE	Okay, okay. I'm cooking-challenged. But when I was a little girl, Olivia used to make me taste everything that she went along.

STEFANO	Oh.

NATALIE	I actually have a pretty good palate.

TYLER	This is delicious.

STEFANO	It would be better if I had Olio d'oliva descadoni. It's an olive oil we make in Parma next to where I come from. I looked for it everywhere, I cannot find it. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Mamma mia. Basta.

NATALIE	I still think the mystery ingredient is ginger. Turmeric! I don't know much about kitchens, but I know that's not good.

STEFANO	And the plumbing is old here, it needs an expert touch.
	
TYLER	Oh God! Oh God, oh.

NATALIE	Expert, huh? Here let me. It's probably just one little pipe.

STEFANO	Tyler, Beebee, go check the washroom.

NATALIE	Everything's gonna be fine. It can't be all the plumbing.

STEFANO	Why not?

NATALIE	Um, because it's Christmas.

BEEBEE	No water in the ladies room.

TYLER	Or the men's.

STEFANO	We cannot open a restaurant without running water.

NATALIE	Problems are just opportunities in disguise.

STEFANO	No, basta. The feast of Natale is off.
	
NATALIE	Any chance they'll finish before Christmas? Okay, thank you, yeah. Yeah, Merry Christmas. Come on, we got this. This is just a chance to show our awesomeness. And we are pretty dang awesome. Am I right?

MRS. MYERS	Hello! I brought that tree skirt you wanted. Do you know you still have lasagne on the back stoop?

NATALIE	Uh, thank you. I'm waiting until spring, so I can give it a proper burial.

MRS. MYERS	You're the only person I know that uses a smoke alarm instead of an egg timer.

NATALIE	Well, good thing we have Chef Stefano.

MRS. MYERS	Very good. Actually I was wondering if I could scrounge an invitation to the festive feast, if you have room.

NATALIE	Of course, you are more than welcome to join us.

MRS. MYERS	Thank you, that pasta the other day, it may mean that handsome is as handsome does, but that handsome does very well in the kitchen. So you finally noticed, huh?

NATALIE	Yeah, in the kitchen. Mrs. Myers, you are terrible. Besides, I think he's interested in Ariella, that caroler from Italy. They seem to have a lot in common.

MRS. MYERS	Oh.

NATALIE	And once Olivia comes back, I'm gonna go back to the city. That's 23 for dinner. We invited the Serena Carolers and Miles Croaker too, of course.

MRS. MYERS	Are you sure that's a good idea?

NATALIE	Yeah, one taste of Stefano's mystery sauce and he is sure to give a rave review.

MRS. MYERS	Miles Croaker has never given any restaurant a rave review. Ever.

NATALIE	Oh.

MRS. MYERS	The last restaurant he penned, well—

NATALIE	What?

MRS. MYERS	Closed within a couple of months.

NATALIE	Oh, so what you're saying is if we fail, we risk totally destroying Olivia's dream.

MRS. MYERS	I'm afraid so.
	
NATALIE	Birds are out in full force. Really glad you agreed we need to have a Christmas tree.

STEFANO	Yeah, we have Christmas tree in Italy, too, you know?

NATALIE	I know. I saw the Pinterest.

STEFANO	And this is it, uh, this is our tree.

NATALIE	I don't know.

STEFANO	I do know. The correct height, uh, the correct amount around. And the correct amount of branches.

NATALIE	There's a correct number of branches?

STEFANO	Yes. Not so many, there's not enough space for decoration, but enough space uh, to be like, to be...

NATALIE	Bushy.

STEFANO	Natalie, it's a tree not a bush.

NATALIE	Just doesn't feel right.

STEFANO	Feel? What does feel have to do with this? It's all about logic like life, uh cooking, like love.
	
NATALIE	Life is not about logic, it's about--oh, what about this one?

STEFANO	Oh, why this one?

NATALIE	I don't know, my instincts just tell me, this is the right tree.

STEFANO	Yeah, I think your instinct uh, mistaken.

NATALIE	My instincts are never wrong.

STEFANO	Huh? Is that right?

NATALIE	Oh.

STEFANO	Oh, hmm.

NATALIE	Wait, did you just say you think you can rely on logic for love?

STEFANO	Of course. What else?

NATALIE	Instincts. Intuition. That little voice inside you that says you're at the perfect place at the perfect time.

STEFANO	And when that has happened to you?

NATALIE	Well, it hasn't happened. Not yet. But it will. What, it's not like logic's really worked out so well for you either.

TYLER	It's-- it's really hard to see under here.

BEEBEE	Um, well, let me get some lights, maybe that'll help. Um Tyler, Tyler! Oh Tyler, are you okay? Tyler, are you okay? Tyler, are you hurt? Are you all chopped up like potato peelings? Are you hurt? Are you chopped up like—

TYLER	No, but I might be deaf from here on out.

BEEBEE	If you heard me ask the question, how can you be deaf?

TYLER	What was that? What was that-- what was that ringing?

BEEBEE	Nevermind the ringing, what about the plumbing?

TYLER	Huh, what? What? What drumming?

BEEBEE	Plumbing, not drumming.

TYLER	Oh, right. Look, um, I'm sorry, Beebee, I can't do this. Tell Ms. Natalie I tried but I guess they're gonna have to cancel the feast of Natale. I'm sorry, alright?

BEEBEE	Okay, hold on. You can't give up. Don't you see this is a chance to prove your awesomeness.

TYLER	Awesomeness, I-- I don't even know if I have any awesomeness.

BEEBEE	Well, here's your chance to find out. It's time to prove your awesomeness, Tyler. You can do this.

TYLER	Okay. Alright, you stand over there.

BEEBEE	Okay! Why?

TYLER	Because if I do find my awesomeness, I wanna make sure it doesn't get shredded in the garbage disposal.
	
NATALIE	Yes!

STEFANO	No!
	
NATALIE	No.

STEFANO	Yes.
	What if your intuition never picks a logical tree?

NATALIE	What if your logic never picks a tree that feels right?

STEFANO	What if intuition is broken?

NATALIE	What if your logic is just stupid?

TREE SELLER	Have you thought about just buying two trees?
	Then you can both be right and happy.

NATALIE	We do have room for it.

STEFANO	I wanna have all day, so yes, thank you.

NATALIE	Okay, two trees it is. Just call it when you see the one you want.

STEFANO	Okay, you too.

NATALIE	Okay.

STEFANO AND NATALIE	Mine!
	
OLIVIA	Natalie, hi, how are you?

NATALIE	Hey, Olivia, um how's the Roman snow-blow?

OLIVIA	Yeah, it's still blowing. Oh. Oh, what's wrong? Did your plan for Christmas with your friends fall through?

NATALIE	It uh, hasn't gone exactly according to plan. Um... I actually kind of have a strange question for you. Do you know where I could get a bottle of Olio d'oliva descadoni.

OLIVIA	Well, that is a rare kind of olive oil.
	You are not gonna try to cook, are you?

NATALIE	No. Um, I just thought it would make a nice gift for um, for a friend.

OLIVIA	Oh, you know, 'cause it's from Parma, the same region as Chef Grimaldi.

NATALIE	Oh, I had no idea. Um, do you know where I can find it in the State?

OLIVIA	No, I do not know of any place outside of Italy, I'm so sorry.

NATALIE	Oh. Well, that's okay. Thanks anyway, Olivia. Um, I have to go. I miss you. Merry Christmas.

OLIVIA	I miss you, too. Merry Christmas.

STEFANO	Perfect.

NATALIE	Keys please. Thanks.

TYLER	Let's have a go, moment of truth. So much for my awesomeness.

BEEBEE	No, Tyler, you've been great. You really have. I mean you know so much more than you thought you did.

TYLER	You think? You've been great too, Beebee. I never would've thought about checking with the city about the main line.

BEEBEE	Thanks.

TYLER	But...

BEEBEE	Yeah.

TYLER	So I guess I'll-- I'll see you back at school in January.

BEEBEE	Yeah. January. Bye. Wait! Did we remember to turn the sink's off valve back on?

TYLER	Yes, yes! Hold on, okay. Alright, here we go.

TYLER AND BEEBEE 	Yes!

TYLER	Yes! Yes! Oh, yes!

NATALIE	Just leave it there.
	
STEFANO	What is that?

NATALIE	I think that's the sound of awesomeness.
	
STEFANO	Awesomeness?

TYLER	Yes, oh yes!

STEFANO	Is that good?

NATALIE	It's very good. Is there a plumber in the house?

BEEBEE	Oh, Ms. Natalie, Tyler got the water back on.

TYLER	Yeah, and Beebee helped, she was-- she was—

STEFANO	Awes-- awesomeness.

TYLER	Well, yeah.

STEFANO	Good, then we start with the pasta.

TYLER	Sure, yeah, I'm ready to do anything.

STEFANO	No Tyler, you better go home and shower not work in the kitchen, huh?

TYLER	Oh yeah, well, I guess yeah, I'm sort of—

BEEBEE	Me too.

STEFANO	Yeah, you've done enough for now. Natalie will help me with the pasta.

NATALIE	Me? You do remember what happened the last time I tried to cook, right?
	
STEFANO	Don't worry, Natalie, you're not cooking. You're just making the tortellinis. I'll be the one cooking them.

NATALIE	Oh, okay, great.

STEFANO	In my country, Natalie, the children do this all the time. I mean at least a child, si.

NATALIE	Si. I mean yes.

STEFANO	Crack the egg into the flour.

NATALIE	Whoops, too hard. Uh, let me try—

STEFANO	Si. Si, si, si, si, si. Another one.

NATALIE	Okay, let me try that again.

STEFANO	Bellissimo. Perfecto. Uh, now need to uh, beat the egg up like you making scrambled eggs, but incorporating the flour slowly. Like this.

NATALIE	Oh, sure.

STEFANO	You never made scrambled eggs?

NATALIE	Yes, I have not.

STEFANO	How have you not starved to death in that city of yours?

NATALIE	Grabhub. The pizza delivery boy.

STEFANO	Ai yai yai.

NATALIE	You know, if everybody stayed home and cooked every night, nobody would need to go to a restaurant.

STEFANO	The egg is getting away.

NATALIE	Oh, ooh, hold on eggies, get back here. Back to your volcano. Don't you wanna be part of the best pasta the world's ever known.

STEFANO	Good. Well, now the pasta is mixed, we need to knead it. It's a very good workout, my-- my-- my nonna, my grandmother, she had arms like a-- like a Schwarzenegger.

NATALIE	Oh. I'm not really sure if that's a ringing endorsement or not.

STEFANO	Ai, you have to lean into it, uh.

NATALIE	Oh.

STEFANO	You need to feel it changing under your hands. Feel it changing?
	
NATALIE	I feel something.

ARIELLA	Buongiorno, anyone here?

STEFANO	Here!

NATALIE	Uh yeah, we're over here.

STEFANO	Ariella.

ARIELLA	Ciao bella.

STEFANO	Ciao.  (Speaking Italian)

ARIELLA	(Speaking Italian) The carolers and I just wanted to drop off po di vino. Not-- not for the feast of Natale of course, but uh, just an early grazie for everything you are doing for us.

STEFANO	Prego. Very thoughtful of you, grazie.

NATALIE	Yes, very, very thoughtful of all of the carolers. Please thank them for us.

ARIELLA	(Speaking Italian) And uh, what's all this? Oh, you make pasta? I used to make pasta with mia nonna every Natale. It uh, it was my favorite part.
	But uh, I can help.

NATALIE	Oh, you cook?

ARIELLA	Of course, I love to cook.

NATALIE	But you're our guest, we couldn't possibly make you work in the kitchen.

ARIELLA	Make me, no, I want to.

STEFANO	We'd love your help.

NATALIE	Oh.

STEFANO	Let me get you an apron.

ARIELLA	(Speaks Italian)

STEFANO	Andiamo.

ARIELLA	Okay.

NATALIE	Great. (Blows raspberry)

ARIELLA	Okay, (Speaking Italian)

STEFANO	Hmm.

ARIELLA	(Speaking Italian)
	(Sighs)

STEFANO	They're waiting for us.

TYLER	Okay, I'm ready. Um, Chef Stefano. How'd you come with your logical list of qualities you're looking for in a woman?

STEFANO	Well, I thought about it and she made sense to me. Why what's the matter?

TYLER	Oh, nothing, nothing. I just-- I guess I just haven't done enough thinking.

STEFANO	Andiamo.

BEEBEE	Baked brie with olive tabouli, minestrone reteta, ricotta and spinach tortellini, braised beef in Merlot wine sauce and something called, "Panettone".

NATALIE	Sounds wonderful. But I'm afraid Stefano's multo-italiano menu isn't gonna trigger any warm American fuzzies.

BEEBEE	I make these really good cookie bars.

NATALIE	Well, it's a start.

BEEBEE	I know, we can make a big batch of cookies and then take the tray into the town Christmas Cookie Swap this afternoon.

NATALIE	Christmas Cookie Swap? This afternoon? Beebee, you just baked my day.
	Ooh, but we're gonna have to hurry if we'll be ready on time. Come on.
	Just like shake some in. Oh!
	
NATALIE	Okay. All over. Everywhere. Oh, looks pretty great.

BEEBEE	Perfect.

NATALIE	Good job. Alright, to the fridge.

BEEBEE	Now we just wait 30 minutes while it sets.

NATALIE	You better set a timer, can't rely on a smoke alarm for this one.

BEEBEE	So I ordered all the place cards and the menu cards, I know you wanted to write them up by hand but until Chef Stefano finalizes the menu...
	Ms. Natalie.

NATALIE	It's like Olio d'oliva descadoni is some kind of—

BEEBEE	Ms. Natalie!

NATALIE	Culinary food myth, like free-range foie gras or guilt-free ice cream.

BEEBEE	Ms. Natalie!

NATALIE	Oh, I'm sorry, what?

BEEBEE	It's time.

NATALIE	Oh shoot, shoot. Hurry, we're gonna be late for the swap. Okay, go, go, go! Hats, coats, gloves, it's cold! The secret to a clean kitchen is simple, don't cook ever.

STEFANO	Porca vacca!

TYLER	What, what, oh sorry, what happened? What? I can't see.

TYLER	Holy cow!

STEFANO	That's what I said, eh, not exactly, but you get the idea.

TYLER	What happened?

STEFANO	There's only one thing I can think of that can cause so much damage to a kitchen in so short of a time.

TYLER	Rabid badgers?

STEFANO	Rabid badgers, Natalie!

TYLER	Ms. Nat-- oh yeah. Yeah, that make-- that makes sense. Well, look-- look at least the smoke alarm isn't going off yet.

STEFANO	This feast of Natale is not gonna work.

TYLER	Why do you say that?

STEFANO	Because we used up our Christmas miracle when Natalie didn't burn the whole place down.

NATALIE	Okay, are we late, did we make it on time?

BEEBEE	Uh no, we made it. Wooh. There's free samples.

NATALIE	That's because you're one smart cookie.

BEEBEE	Don't say it.
	
NATALIE	Big beautiful bars, thank you.

BEEBEE	Thank you.

NATALIE	Ooh, maybe we should do two, alright? Thank you.

BEEBEE	Hmm, yummy.

NATALIE	They almost look like a little reindeer poop or something. It-- it has to be.

BEEBEE	They're really good.

NATALIE	Yeah.

BEEBEE	Gingerbread cookie.

NATALIE	Thank you. Merry Christmas. Beebee, did we forget to turn the oven off or something?

BEEBEE	We never turned it on. Oh, but maybe we forgot to tidy up.

NATALIE	I didn't forget, we really didn't have time.

STEFANO	What is that, what is this, this cooking, huh? What is this? Hmm?

NATALIE	I'm sorry, I think we may have left the kitchen a little not clean.

STEFANO	Not clean. I come inside and I take a look and I say-- and I-- and I- and I-- what'd I say—

NATALIE	Che—

STEFANO	What I-- I-- I—

NATALIE	(Speaks Italian)

STEFANO	(Speaking Italian)

NATALIE	Oh, grande like grand, a big-- a big mess.

STEFANO	Uh yeah, it's a big mess. We have only one day left, so much to do and you run off for this.

NATALIE	Uh, why don't you take my half—

BEEBEE	Yeah, okay.

NATALIE	And head back to the restaurant and get started on the clean-up.
	Hmm.

STEFANO	Explain to me.

TYLER	Yeah, I'll help.

BEEBEE	Oh, you don't have to do that, it wasn't your mess.

TYLER	No, no, I-- I wanna help.

BEEBEE	You do?

TYLER	Yeah, Chef Stefano scares me when he's like this.

STEFANO	I-- I-- I-- I-- I don't even know what these cookies are?

NATALIE	Oh look, these are shortbreads with a little um, icing drizzled and this little gingerbread man. Little gingerbread man, "Can't catch me, I'm a gingerbread man."

STEFANO	No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, Natalie. This is an Italian feast of Natale, not the American feast of cookie. Capito?

NATALIE	Mhmm.

STEFANO	We will do panettone made by my family recipe, capisce?

NATALIE	And the cookies.

STEFANO	Mamma mia.

NATALIE	I read on Miles' reviews, I think he would really like—

MILES	Uh, Natalie. Stefano.

STEFANO	Congratulations, eh! Speak of the devil.

MILES	Hello.

STEFANO	Ariella, ciao.

ARIELLA	Ciao, Stefano.
	
STEFANO	Mr. Croaker.

ARIELLA	Natalie, ciao.

NATALIE	Hello.
	
MILES	Well, everybody is so excited and looking forward to your feast of Natale.
	
NATALIE	So are we. We uh, we're just gonna head back there and get some things ready. We want it all to be just perfect.

MILES	That means you're coming to the Christmas festival, it's about to start.

STEFANO	Oh, no, no, there is so much to do. Sorry, yeah.

NATALIE	So much to do.

STEFANO	More than ever.

MILES	Uh, but it's our first annual Christmas festival, you must come. We need everyone to make it a success. I organized it myself.

STEFANO	If you insist.

NATALIE	We'll be there with bells on. Like jingle bells.

STEFANO	Oh.

NATALIE	Um, cool uh, we'll just go get ready now. See you soon.

MILES	Do that.

NATALIE	See you soon.

SANTA	Alright, alright, this way. Get on there.

BEEBEE	Okay, you there. Okay, ready.

SANTA	Cheese.

TYLER	Yes!

STALLHOLDER	Congratulations!

TYLER	Thank you.
	Here.

BEEBEE	Thank you.

MILES	Oh, you're here! I have just the thing. Right this way. Oh uh, but first, picture. Right, here we go! Here we go, have to keep the line moving.
	
NATALIE	Sit down, Sparky. Sit down.

BEEBEE	This one looks fun.

TYLER	Oh yeah, sure. Thanks. Go first.

BEEBEE	Sure, yeah. Okay, wooh.

TYLER	Aw. Here let me try. It's okay. Do you feel okay?

BEEBEE	Yeah. How do I look like I'm feeling?

TYLER	Well, I don't know, but-- but nothing good. So uh, have you seen any good Kung Fu movies lately?

BEEBEE	Mm, nope. Why?

TYLER	Uh, just-- just curious. What about baseball games?

BEEBEE	In December?

TYLER	Well, at least you know they don't play baseball in the winter.

BEEBEE	Yeah, well, that's what I know, so...

STEFANO	Yeah, I forgot to ask uh, about what you do in the city? What is your job?

NATALIE	Oh, I'm a Jacklyn of all trades. I watch the dogs, do specialty gift-wrapping, plan events and parties, and about a hundred other things.

STEFANO	Huh, why do you do so many things? Why don't you just do one thing?

NATALIE	I don't know, I guess I just never found the right thing and so I kept trying new things.

STEFANO	Hmm, when I was 3 years old my Zio Lorenzo, he put a knife in my hand and I knew I would be a chef. That is all I ever wanna be.

NATALIE	Your Zio Lorenzo gave a butcher's knife to a 3-year-old?

STEFANO	No, Maybe I exaggerate a little bit, huh?

NATALIE	Well, maybe you're exaggerating now.

STEFANO	Maybe you're afraid, huh?

NATALIE	I'm not scared of anything.

STEFANO	Except perhaps the cold, yes?

NATALIE	It's not that bad.

STEFANO	No, you're cold.

BEEBEE	What's that?

TYLER	What's what?

BEEBEE	The piece of paper you keep checking.

TYLER	What, what piece of paper?

BEEBEE	The one in your pocket.

TYLER	Um...

BEEBEE	Catch!

TYLER	No! Beebee, Beebee, no, no, no, no. Don't, don't.

BEEBEE	Oh, what is it, a letter to Santa?

TYLER	Don't-- just don't-- just don't-- just don't- just-- can-- can you give it back to me please, Beebee?

BEEBEE	What is this? My smile, awesomeness, likes baseball. What is this, like a list of things I'm supposed to be or something?

TYLER	No, it's...

BEEBEE	I'm not hardly any of these things.

TYLER	Beebee, it isn't like that, it's just-- I was just--I was just trying to be logical, that's all.

BEEBEE	You're a jerk.

TYLER	Beebee. Beebee.

STEFANO	That's it.

MILES	(Indiscernible speech)

NATALIE	Thanks.

MILES	Welcome.

NATALIE	Alright, Sparky. Beebee, what's the matter? What happened? Are you okay?

BEEBEE	It's Tyler, he's being really logical. I can't—

NATALIE	Okay, let's go have some cocoa, you can tell me about it.

STEFANO	Grazie.

NATALIE	Why don't you start at the beginning?

BEEBEE	We were at the Santa sling booth and I was-- I was trying to figure out how Tyler felt about me. He started asking all these stupid questions about Kung Fu and baseball, checking his stupid list. He said he was just trying to be logical. But then he can't possibly like me, I don't like any of the things on the stupid list, especially not the nice smile part.

NATALIE	Oh. Beebee, hey. Your smile is lovely just how it is, I promise. What could give Tyler such a silly idea like this? Speaks Italian, lives at the same place, loves to cook.

BEEBEE	You okay?

NATALIE	Yeah. Of course, um, what happened next?

BEEBEE	Well, I decided my intuition was telling me Tyler is a jerk and I left.

NATALIE	But maybe you should just sleep on it, you know? Give your intuition some time to think it over.

BEEBEE	Yeah, I think I'll do that. Christmas is exhausting.
	
STEFANO	Everything okay?

NATALIE	You know, I think I'm just gonna go back to the restaurant.

STEFANO	But the festival is important, Natalie.

ARIELLA	(Speaking Italian)

STEFANO	Si.

ARIELLA	And Natalie is here, too.

STEFANO	But we were thinking uh, we're gonna go back, it's-- there's so much to do.

NATALIE	Oh no, you don't have to go, too. You can stay, I'm sure you want to.

STEFANO	What, and let you do all the work? No. What if you try to cook and burn the entire place down to the ground?
	
ARIELLA	It is time to sing. You must come, you need to come with me.

NATALIE	Ooh, Sparky. Sorry. Sorry, Sparky.

ARIELLA	(Speaking Italian)

STEFANO	Grazie.

ARIELLA	 Angels we have heard on high   Sweetly singing o'er the  plains And the mountains in reply Echoing their joyous strains 

CAROLERS	Gloria In excelsis Deo Gloria  In excelsis Deo

STEFANO	Natalie! Where are you going?

NATALIE	Home.

STEFANO	Home. The festival just started, uh, you don't like it.

NATALIE	Look, can I ask you something?

STEFANO	Yes.

NATALIE	Can we just keep things strictly business between the two of us?

STEFANO	Strictly business? I know something is wrong, I can tell. And it is a word for it uh, a word that is not a word. Uh, you are eh.

NATALIE	A fork?

STEFANO	Hangry. You need to eat and Sparky, too. Let's go to Pezzo Di Parma, I will cook for the both of you, let's go.

NATALIE	No. Listen, I said I just wanna keep things strictly business.

STEFANO	What-- how? How strictly business? Business is food, food is business for me. How is it not strictly business?

NATALIE	The thing is I don't know if we're really ready to be a business. I mean I don't know if we're really ready to do a big feast of Natale, not for this many people and not for Miles who's never given a rave restaurant review in his entire life.

STEFANO	He hasn't, not ever?

NATALIE	No. And I read all of them and worse, every place he pens, it shuts down.

STEFANO	Natalie, I put every bit of money I have in Pezzo Di Parma.

NATALIE	I didn't know that. Um—

STEFANO	And if we close, Natalie, it's worse uh, I cannot stay in America, I have to go back to Italy.

NATALIE	See, we uh-- we can't do this to you. Or to cousin Olivia, we can't ruin your dreams before they've even begun.

STEFANO	Now you think my food is not good enough, huh?

NATALIE	That's not what I'm saying, I just-- we don't have the time or the people—

STEFANO 	And this is why you don't want to come to eat now?

NATALIE	It's not about that, I just don't—

STEFANO 	Natalie.

NATALIE	What?

STEFANO	If my food is not good enough for you, certo is not good enough for anybody. Anybody. The feast of Natale, Natalie, is off. Fine.
	(Grunts)

NATALIE	Fine! Fine! It's off!

STEFANO 	Okay.

NATALIE	God, stupid Stefano. Come on, Sparky. Come.
	
STEFANO	Panettone, panettone. I'll make panettone, it'll make me feel better.

NATALIE 	It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, come on. This way, this way.
	
MILES	Ooh, Natalie. What are you doing here?

NATALIE	Uh, Mr. Croaker, there is something I need to tell you and um, I thought I should probably say it in person. I'm very sorry. And please don't hold this against my cousin Olivia or Stefano, but...Um... Uh, what's wrong?

STEFANO	Has something happened?

NATALIE	Stefano, you didn't have to come, I can take care of this myself.

STEFANO	This is not only your cousin Olivia restaurant, it-- it's also mine.

NATALIE	Has someone had bad news?

MILES	Oh, oh no, nothing like that, they're just missing their friends and family because it's Christmas. I thought singing might cheer them up, but uh, it's made things worse. Cassie has never spent a Christmas away from her children before. Oh, and this was supposed to be Charlie's first Christmas with his new fiancé.

NATALIE	Oh no, that's so sad.

MILES	There'll be other Christmases, but right now it's hard for them all to be far away from home. But everyone is looking forward to your Christmas meal tomorrow.

MILES 	Now what is it you wanted to tell me?

NATALIE	Could you excuse us just one minute? I feel terrible. I feel terrible.

STEFANO	Yeah, me too. I wanted to do everything my own way, just the right review, but now look at this.

NATALIE	I wanted to show Olivia how much her help and support meant to me and I guess I thought I could only do that if everything was perfect. I think I kind of lost seeing that's it's Christmas.

STEFANO	Yeah, yeah, it's Christmas.
	
NATALIE	And the kitchen.

STEFANO	Yes, in there, too.

NATALIE	What if we just go through with it? What if we don't worry about if it's perfect or what the review says, what if we just do it to feed a bunch of sad people that have nowhere else to go on Christmas?

STEFANO	Yes, yes. Let's do it for the people. And we need to be happy, it's Christmas.
	Okay?

NATALIE	Okay.

STEFANO	Let's do it.
	
MILES	Natalie, Stefano, uh you had something to tell us?

NATALIE	Yeah, just that the feast of Natale is at 100 and to bring your appetites. It's gonna be awesomeness. Hello, Natalie Rogers, travel consult-- oh um, events planning, um actually Jacklyn of all trades, just uh tell me which one you want. The Olio d'oliva Schedoni? Yeah. I've been looking for everywhere. Back-ordered? Until when? July. Oh um, oh. Okay, thanks anyways.

OLIVIA	You wanna tell me what's got you so despondent over this olive oil?

NATALIE	Olivia! Hi.

OLIVIA	Hi.

NATALIE	Oh, but how?

OLIVIA	Oh, they finally dug Rome out from under that avalanche, I got the first flight I could. Why are you here? I thought you were spending Christmas with your friends in the city.

NATALIE	I was, but I don't know I know how hard you worked and how much this means to you, so I just—

OLIVIA	Oh, it's so beautiful. Thank you. But why?

NATALIE	It's a long, long story.

OLIVIA	Oh. Is it now? Well, that's good, 'cause I am a long, long listener.
	
NATALIE	Well, even after 22 phone calls, and a dozen international emails, and millions of hours scouring the internet, I still couldn't find the Olio d'oliva Schedoni, so Stefano could have his perfect Christmas.

OLIVIA	Do you like Stefano?

NATALIE	No! I mean I like him. I don't like-like him. He's kinda grumpy sometimes.

OLIVIA	Oh. So you don't like him?
	
NATALIE	Even if I did, I have to go back to the city. I have a life there and I don't know, I can't stay here.

OLIVIA	You're jumping again.

NATALIE	I'm what?

OLIVIA	You do this thing where you leap from job to job, city to city. What are you afraid of?

NATALIE	I'm not scared of anything.

OLIVIA	Falling in love can be scary. Well, it's been a long flight and an even longer day and I think tomorrow is gonna be really, really exciting. Let's go home.

NATALIE	Oh, I'm so glad you could make it home in time for Christmas.

OLIVIA	Me too.

NATALIE	Oh, um and if you see any lasagne in the yard, could you just ignore it?

OLIVIA	You did try to cook again, didn't you?

NATALIE	Uh, yeah.

OLIVIA	It's good that you reach for the stars.

NATALIE	No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Sorry.

STEFANO	Natalie.

NATALIE	I'm sorry.

STEFANO	Your terribleness in the kitchen is contagious.

NATALIE	Uh, you'll be glad I said something. Merry Christmas.

STEFANO	Thank you.

NATALIE	Oh, you should open that now.

STEFANO	Merry Christmas to you, too.

NATALIE	Oh. You didn't have to do that.

STEFANO	Come on, bella signorina first.

NATALIE	If you insist. Is this the recipe for the mystery sauce? You're actually giving away the mystery?

STEFANO	Yeah, and this way you don't lie awake at night wondering.

NATALIE	Rosemary. Of course. How did I not guess that?

STEFANO	Maybe when you go back to your city, you can find someone somehow who can cook it for you. Not just a pizza delivery boy, huh? Capito?

NATALIE	Okay. Your turn.
	
STEFANO	Olio d'oliva Schedoni. Natalie how? Grazie.
	
NATALIE	What's it smell like?

STEFANO	Like home.

NATALIE	I'm sorry you couldn't be home for Christmas.

STEFANO	I know, this is my home now.

NATALIE	I still think you could use a pinch of thyme. Where are the little elves?

STEFANO	Tyler was here—

NATALIE	Be here.

STEFANO	He told me that he needed to add something outside, I don't know.

NATALIE	Okay. Merry Christmas.

BEEBEE	Merry Christmas.

TYLER	Merry Christmas.

NATALIE	Are you guys ready to get to work?

BEEBEE	Mhmm, mhmm, yeah.

TYLER	Sure, totally ready.

NATALIE	Great. Places, everybody.

BEEBEE	Turns out that he likes braces.
	
OLIVIA	Gonna give you a little bit more that, a little bit more, mix it in.
	
NATALIE	They're almost here! Merry Christmas!

ARIELLA	Ciao, Natalie. Buon Natale!

NATALIE	Welcome to Ristorante Pezzo Di Parma. Yep, one more. I can take that, no problem.

CAROLER 1	Merry Christmas.

NATALIE	Thank you, merry Christmas. Uh, find a seat. They should be labeled.

STEFANO	Go.
	
OLIVIA	Alright, fair, fair.

CAROLER 2	Yes, I just got my haircut.
	
ARIELLA	Emma, I-- I-- I like your uh, (Speaks Italian). Uh...

EMMA	My necklace.

ARIELLA	Necklace, yeah, oh it's bella.

EMMA	(Indistinct speech)

ARIELLA	Oh, thank you, thank you very much. Um, they're um, not real. They look real?

EMMA	Yeah.

ARIELLA	Ooh, formaggio.

EMMA	Ooh, that looks good.

MILES	(Indistinct speech)

ARIELLA	I know I'm so hungry, I'm very--I got these in a store...

NATALIE	They're almost done with the antipasto, how's the soup coming along?

STEFANO	It's just about.

ARIELLA	(Speaking Italian)

NATALIE	Okay, yep, mhmm.

TYLER	Oh we-- can we—

STEFANO	It's just about. Okay, go.

NATALIE	That was suspenseful.

STEFANO	This is for you. You need to keep up your strength.

NATALIE	Cocoa with whipped cream and nutmeg. How'd you know my favorite cocoa?

STEFANO	Hey, I know. I asked cugina Olivia.

NATALIE	Even with everything else you had to do? Thank you.

STEFANO	Prego.

NATALIE	Mmm.
	
STEFANO	Scusi.
	
NATALIE	What's so funny?

STEFANO	Niente, niente.
	
NATALIE	Do I have food in my teeth?

STEFANO	Uh, not your teeth, no. Alright.

NATALIE	Can you get me a napkin or something?

STEFANO	Si, si.
	
OLIVIA	Now didn't I remember that there was a polar bear in your driveway one time?

ARIELLA	Not anymore, not anymore, I-- since I've moved here-- Oh, thank you.

OLIVIA	We saw one last night, we did. Please try the pasta. We-- it's a family recipe.
	I hope you like it.

ARIELLA	Mangiamo.
	
STEFANO	Does he like it?
	
OLIVIA	Huh.
	
MILES	Hmm.
	
STEFANO	Hmm.
	
MILES	Ladies and gentlemen, I have been reviewing restaurants for over 20 years. It has been my privilege to dine in some of the finest establishments in this country. And in that time I have never, not once, tasted a perfect dish.
	Until now.

CAROLER 4	Bravo to the chef.

NATALIE	Take your bow.

MILES	Bravo to our chef.
	
NATALIE	Take your bows.

MILES	Magnificent.

STEFANO	Thank you, thank you very much.
	
STEFANO	Thank you. Grazie. Hope you enjoy. Grazie.

ARIELLA	Natalie, may I speak with you a moment?

NATALIE	Yeah, of course.

ARIELLA	Uh, alone.

NATALIE	Sure. Um, over here. Everything okay with the meal? Can I get you anything else?

ARIELLA	Oh, it's the most wonderful feast of Natale I've ever had. Not about that I want to ask you. It is uh, you do not actually work for Pezzo Di Parma, this is correct?

NATALIE	That's right. I have my own business. Or businesses really, in the city.

ARIELLA	Good. I am hoping that Stefano will offer me a job once you return to the city.

NATALIE	But you're singing.

ARIELLA	I like Stefano.

NATALIE	Oh. I see.

ARIELLA	You are friends with Stefano? Do you think that maybe he likes me?

NATALIE	I don't know. Um, I-- I think you're perfect for him.

STEFANO	Beautiful. Exquisite.

NATALIE	Stefano.

STEFANO	Ah, it'll be ready in a minute.

NATALIE	Great, um, maybe you can give Ariella a minute to talk to you.
	And you might wanna look at this in case you forgot.

STEFANO	Grazie. Ciao.

ARIELLA	Ciao.
	
NATALIE	What are you doing?

STEFANO	We need to change it.

NATALIE	Thyme. Really? You took my advice?

STEFANO	Only because uh, it was right. Natalie. Why so sad on Christmas?

NATALIE	I'm not sad. I'm happy for you and Ariella.

STEFANO	Me and Ariella?

NATALIE	Of course. She likes you, you have to know that.

STEFANO	Yes. And I told her I was happy to give her a job. Not all my heart.

NATALIE	But she fits right in with your philosophy of logic, and love, life, and cooking.
	She fits your list to a tee.

STEFANO	Natalie, my philosophy has changed.

NATALIE	To what?

STEFANO	Panettone! The panettone!
	
NATALIE	What happened?

STEFANO	Panettone, I burned the panettone.
	
NATALIE	But a chef never lets his food burn. Not for anything.

STEFANO	I forgot.

NATALIE	How could you forget?

TYLER	What are we gonna do about dessert? They're almost finished with the main course.

BEEBEE	We know.

NATALIE	The cookies.
	
OLIVIA	Aha. Try the red ones. Alright. There is a family tradition that we have where you go around the dinner table and say what the best part of this Christmas is. I guess I'll go first. Um, for me the best part of this Christmas is being able to get home in time to share it with all of you. And my cousin Natalie, and my friend Stefano, who made all of this possible.
	
MRS. MYERS	The best part of this Christmas has been sharing this meal with all of you all and my elastic waistband which made all of it possible.
	

NATALIE	Cheers. Oh, um my favorite part of this Christmas is um, well, I've always kind of been jumping around from job to job, waiting for something to tell me that I finally have found the perfect thing. And nothing ever felt quite right. But this year, this Christmas um, I finally found a place that feels like home. And someone I'd really like to share it with.

OLIVIA	Stefano.

STEFANO	My favorite part of this Christmas, uh well...You, Natalie. It is this.
	
OLIVIA	Why are we all watching? Oh my God!
