??	When are you getting married

??	I’m anxious

??	What are you anxious for

??	Look, Young is good-looking trains kung fu, and he takes care of you

??	If you don’t take advantage now, he’s gonna run

??	Alright, well think about your own issues

??	Me? Am I not doing great

??	All talk, you have never liked any boy well

??	Yes

??	There’s this pudgy kid in my class. Very round and plumpy

??	So cute, you can roll him around

??	I like him a lot, you know

??	I’m talking about a real relationship

??	For that record, zero. Hey, if there was I’d tell you first

??	Fan, I heard your return for this trip you carried a scroll along the way

??	Grandpa told me this scroll is from a Master during the Qing Dynasty

??	Fang Qi Niang’s handwritten “Wing Chun White Crane Fist”

??	108 postures of the system drawn

??	It was then taken to the imperial palace during times of endless war

??	It eventually ended up in Grandpa’s hands he and a few professional weavers spent two years 
??	time rebuilding

??	This is the final step to the scroll’s rightful place

??	Wow, never thought this scroll told such a long story

??	Yeah, this is to be returned to Wing Chun village

??	It is grandfather’s wish proof of the White Crane system’s history

??	I understand, it’s priceless

??	No wonder there’s so many people after it

??	But even now

??	I still don’t know who these guys are

??	Do you think perhaps it’s someone into antiques or a collector of some sort

??	Doesn’t matter, we must protect it here, let’s take a look

??	Alright

??	Wow

??	Hey, there’s a picture

??	Do you recognize the girl

??	To stick it with the scroll must be some connection there

??	Grandpa said when he was young he came to Wing Chun

??	His heart belonged to a girl with the surname Jen

??	Grandfather eventually left for Taiwan, and they lost contact

??	He tried to find her, but none of his letters returned

??	Was she grandpa’s first love

??	Must be a big deal to him reminds you of a romantic tragedy cliche

??	Don’t joke, I don’t think it’s chance that we return the scroll to the same place his first love was 
??	discovered

??	Alright I’ll look at it as real love

??	Not look, it really is

??	How about we help grandpa search

??	Who knows, we actually might end up finding her

??	We have to do this for Grandpa

??	Alright

??	OK

??	Jen Wei   Ms. Jen

??	Jen Wei

??	Who’s Jen Wei

??	Is this you in the photo

??	Oh Wei! Gorbon

??	We all grew up together

??	Wei had a very hard life

??	She lost her parents very young

??	Many of our villagers helped out raising her

??	She was also the village’s prettiest girl

??	All the young men had a crush on her

??	But Wei only liked Gorbon

??	A shame what time can do

??	Just when this couple had fallen in love

??	That Gorbon left the village

??	And had never returned since

??	A broken heart

??	Wei just waited a lifetime for him

??	She never married anyone

??	Well would you happen to know

??	Where does old lady Jen live

??	She lives on top of the mountain all alone now

??	You guys can follow this route

??	Keep going up and then you will see a small house there

??	Thank you granny

??	Thank you granny?bye

??	Thank you granny

??	We should be almost there

??	Let’s go

??	Stop pulling me

??	Hurry up

??	It’s getting dark, hurry up

??	Should be right there

??	There’s an old lady, could it be her

??	Excuse me are Ms. Jen

??	Who is it

??	We’re Gorbon Chen’s granddaughters

??	How is your grandfather

??	He’s doing well

??	He’s currently in Taiwan

??	I’ll give him a call right now

??	Ok

??	Hi, Grandpa

??	We found Ms. Jen Wei

??	The one you always mention

??	Ms. Jen

??	Wait a second, I’ll let her speak to you

??	Here, Ms. Jen

??	Gorbon

??	Gorbon

??	Gorbon

??	Jen Wei

??	How are you

??	I

??	I

??	I’m fine

??	I’m fine

??	Just old

??	We’re older

??	These years

??	I’ve had people try look for your whereabouts

??	But none could find you

??	I didn’t think

??	I didn’t think

??	Our differences

??	I know I know

??	Would separate us for so many decades

??	I knew you would come find me

??	So I always waited

??	Finally, today is that day

??	I’m sorry

??	I’m so sorry

??	I made you wait a lifetime

??	Don’t apologize

??	I never blamed you

??	I would never blame you      

??	Even though I waited a lifetime

??	And we couldn’t grow old together

??	But

??	We never stopped

??	We never forgot each other completely

??	I understand now

??	When you wait for someone

??	Even if it requires a lifetime

??	Spending it alone

??	Is still a lifetime nonetheless

??	Which is why I chose to wait

??	Because

??	Only the ones who cherish what they have are thankful for an eternity

??	Do you know

??	Sometimes

??	When you wait for someone

??	It is also a feeling of romance

??	Some say

??	Meeting the right person at the right time is a chance of luck

??	But just like any other encounter, it was not wasted for the enjoyment of that very moment represents true happiness and even though our time together was short we have never wronged each other that is most important that is my life my most beautiful memory

??	Gorbon

??	Using a lifetime to wait for you

??	I willfully accepted

??	And without regret if

??	I had to choose once more

??	I would still make the same choice without hesitation

??	Jen Wei

??	My

??	My

??	My

??	My next lifetime will forever be by your side 

??	Jen Wei

??	Meeting the right person at the right time

??	Is a chance of luck

??	But just like any other encounter, it was not wasted for the enjoyment of that very moment represents true happiness

??	I LOVE YOU BABY
