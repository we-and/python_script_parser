NEWSCASTER	I’ve just been advised by our group that we are deploying
NEWSCASTER	six members of law enforcement and two canine dogs to aid in the search…
NEWSCASTER	…another day of searching in the desert for clues 
NEWSCASTER	in the case of three missing teens.
NEWSCASTER	…local law enforcement agencies are here.
NEWSCASTER	While there’s still volunteers continuing the search, the satellite images…
NEWSCASTER	…so anyone with any information at all…
NEWSCASTER	…doubled since yesterday.  As more time goes on they’re really pushing
NEWSCASTER	their resources to make sure these teenagers are found.
STEVE	You know I read an article
STEVE	you wouldn’t believe the living you could make photographing food.
JOSH	Hey dad, what’s the secret to making a great burger?
STEVE	Well the first thing you got to do is you got to get your coals hot.
STEVE	Super hot, so when you put it on there it seals in the juices.
STEVE	Then you don’t flip it but one time.
STEVE	That’s the secret.
GUESTS	HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR SOPHIE
GUESTS	HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.
CAROLINE	Make a wish, sweetie. Make a good one.
CAROLINE	Ok, keep going.
CAROLINE	Keep going, one more! You did it!
STEVE	Go, go, go!
CAROLINE	Come on.  Sit down.
JOSH	Imagine that you were going to talk to grown-up Sophie.
JOSH	What would you say to yourself?
YOUNG SOPHIE	I don’t know.
JOSH	You don’t know?	
JOSH	Can you give Sophie some advice for the future?
GRANDFATHER	Sophie, when you get older you must obey your husband.
GRANDFATHER	You must obey him.
JOSH	Gramps!
STEVE	What, to Soph?
JOSH	Yeah.
STEVE	Yeah.
STEVE	You want to do it right now?
STEVE	Happy birthday, honey. I love you.
CAROLINE	I love you, Sophie. You’re the best. Your brother is crazy but I love him too.
CAROLINE	And now he’s going to talk to you, so give me the camera.
JOSH	No, no, no, I’m the director.
CAROLINE	No honey, I want the camera now.
CAROLINE	No, it’s your turn. Sit down next to your sister. Come on.
CAROLINE	Now you know how I feel.
JOSH	Ok, ok.
CAROLINE	All right.
CAROLINE	I want you to say something very sweet to your sister.
CAROLINE	A nice wish for her sixth year of life. Go.
SOPHIE	This is how I remember my brother. How I try to.
SOPHIE	Sitting next to me at my sixth birthday party.
SOPHIE	Before anyone knew our lives were about to change.
SOPHIE	That this would be the last time we were all together.
STEVE	Hey.
SOPHIE	Hey!
STEVE	It’s so good to see you.
SOPHIE	Good to see you.
STEVE	How was your flight?
SOPHIE	Good. This is Jay.
SOPHIE	Jay, this is my dad Steve.
JAY	How are you Steve?
JAY	Nice to meet you.
SOPHIE	What did you pack, Jay?
STEVE	Are you going to be filming the whole time?
SOPHIE	Yeah, that’s the idea.
JAY	You’re like Harrison Ford.
JAY	Ok, I’m over here in the scam lot.
STEVE	That’s what they do, they scam you. They’ve got the public one
STEVE	that’s so far over it may as well be in another county.
STEVE	You go there you’re going to miss your flight.
STEVE	They resell the flight and then you’re shit out of luck is what you are.
STEVE	So you’ve got your own little reality show?
SOPHIE	It’s not a reality show, dad. It’s a documentary.
STEVE	Documentary? Ok.
STEVE	What’s your documentary about?
SOPHIE	It’s about Josh.
STEVE	Josh?
NEWSCASTER	Anyone with any information at all
NEWSCASTER	we’re asking you to please call a special tip line.
NEWSCASTER	…another day of searching in the desert for clues
NEWSCASTER	in the case of three missing teens.
NEWSCASTER	Search efforts have doubled since yesterday. As more time goes on
NEWSCASTER	they’re really pushing their resources to make sure these teenagers are found.
POLICE OFFICER	We will continue to return here
POLICE	until we’ve completely exhausted everything that we think we need to do.
NEWSCASTER	There are still volunteers continuing the search
NEWSCASTER	and satellite imaging is ongoing.
NEWSCASTER	Arizona State Police are now in their third week
NEWSCASTER	searching for missing teenagers Ashley Foster, Mark Abrams,
NEWSCASTER	and Josh Bishop.
STEVE	Sold.
SOPHIE	Yeah.
SOPHIE	You don’t want to come in?
STEVE	No, I better not. Just say hi to mom for me.
SOPHIE	Ok.
STEVE	Ok?
SOPHIE	I’ll talk to you later.
STEVE	Ok. Bye.
CAROLINE	I like your bangs.
CAROLINE	You’re so cute!
SOPHIE	Mom!
CAROLINE	While you’re here you’ve got to go through everything
CAROLINE	Or else I’m giving it to the yard sale, ok?
SOPHIE	I’m fine, ok? I don’t need my blankie.
CAROLINE	As you can see, what’s the point of redecorating?
CAROLINE	While you’re here I was hoping you could help me pick up this stuff.
CAROLINE	I have a ton of boxes in the garage 
CAROLINE	and between the two of us it shouldn’t take us…
SOPHIE	Do you still have the tapes?
SOPHIE	This is it, huh?
CAROLINE	Yeah, that’s the one. That’s how it all started.
CAROLINE	No, it’s your turn. Sit down next to your sister. Come on.
CAROLINE	Now you know how I feel.
JOSH	Ok, ok.
CAROLINE	I want you to say something very sweet to your sister.
CAROLINE	A nice wish for her sixth year of life. Go.
JOSH	Ok. Well, Sophie
JOSH	I have one thing to say to you…
STEVE	Wow. Look at this.
CAROLINE	Is that an airplane?
STEVE	I don’t know.
CAROLINE	Josh! Careful!
STEVE	It’s bright.
JOSH	Hold on.
STEVE	I don’t think it’s an airplane.
STEVE	Look at that! A fourth one!
STEVE	They’re in a formation of some kind but they’re not really moving.
STEVE	Five, six, seven lights!
JOSH	Have you guys ever seen anything like this before?
STEVE	You see that? You see that? What is that?
CAROLINE	What is that?
JOSH	That’s definitely not a plane.
STEVE	That’s one object.
STEVE	Wow, I’ve never seen anything like it.
CAROLINE	Honey, zoom in on it.
JOSH	I’m zooming, mom.
CAROLINE	Ok, ok.
CHILD	They’re aliens or something.
JOSH	They’re gone.
CAROLINE	That’s weird.
JOSH	What was that?
STEVE	I don’t know.
STEVE	They could have gone behind the mountain maybe.
PARTY GUEST	No, there’s no clouds!
STEVE	Well, that was interesting.
CAROLINE	That was a show, right?
JOSH	Guys, you know what that was? 
JOSH	Those were UFO’s!
CAROLINE	Oh, come on.
JOSH	Those were UFO’s!
JOSH	That’s what a UFO is!
CAROLINE	You guys, I think that’s our cue to clean up.
JOSH	Are you kidding me? Dad!
STEVE	It was probably
STEVE	I don’t know, military.
CAROLINE	Yeah, we’ve got to get the presents, Josh.
STEVE	Josh, put the camera down and just help your mother clean up.
JOSH	Soph, what do you think that was?
SOPHIE	I don’t know!
JOSH	Holy moly.
STEVE	You ok, Soph?
JOSH	You all right?
JOSH	That was the Air Force, dad!
STEVE	Well I hope it was our Air Force.
JOSH	Grandpa.
YOUNG SOPHIE	That was amazing!
NEWSCASTER	When these lights appeared over Phoenix
NEWSCASTER	people immediately thought: UFO’s. Outer space.
STEVE	We were standing about here?
JOSH	Right about here.
JOSH	They went just over the valley toward South Mountain
JOSH	in what seemed to be a “V” formation.
STEVE	It was definitely interesting.
NEWSCASTER	So far the military hasn’t claimed any testing in the area from nearby
NEWSCASTER	Luke Air Force Base, which leaves many residents wondering
NEWSCASTER	what were those mysterious lights?
JOSH	It seemed like the Air Force didn’t know what it was, and if that’s true then
JOSH	what was it? I don’t know.
GOVERNOR	 And now I’ll ask Officer Stein and his colleagues
GOVERNOR	to escort the accused into the room so that we may
GOVERNOR	all look upon the guilty party.
GOVERNOR	Don’t get him too close to me, please.
GOVERNOR	This goes to show you guys are entirely too serious.
CAROLINE	No one really took it that seriously from what I remember. Except Josh.
SOPHIE	Would you say he was sort of single-minded about stuff,
SOPHIE	once he got an idea?
CAROLINE	Yeah. Yeah, there was no stopping him.
JOSH	Peeeeeeew.
JOSH	Peeeeeew. 
JOSH	Excuse me sir, do you have a second to talk about the…
MAN	Nope.
JOSH	Ok, thank you.
HOMELESS MAN	It was just a “V” like this.
JOSH	And you saw that yourself?
HOMELESS MAN	It was just a “V” like that, man. And we were like,
HOMELESS MAN	“hey man, check that out man.”
YOUNG MAN	I know UFO’s will come at us
YOUNG MAN	and attack one day.
JOSH	You think they’ll attack?
YOUNG MAN	And if that happens, we will be prepared.
JOSH	So did you see the lights?
ASHLEY	No, not personally.
JOSH	Ok, so you saw them on the news?
ASHLEY	Yeah.
JOSH	Awesome. Channel 3?
ASHLEY	No.
JOSH	It doesn’t matter.
JOSH	Do you think it was a UFO?
ASHLEY	I don’t know. Maybe.
JOSH	Ok, so…
ASHLEY	Can I ask you something now?
JOSH	Yeah.
ASHLEY	Can I give you some advice?
JOSH	Sure, yeah.
ASHLEY	This is an interview, right?
JOSH	Yeah.
ASHLEY	So maybe you should ask me some open-ended questions.
ASHLEY	You know, things that don’t just warrant yes or no answers.
ASHLEY	Just get me to talk…
JOSH	Ok, sure.
ASHLEY	Is this the same place?
MELISSA	She just had this charm about her that was electric.
MELISSA	I think because of that she could get a lot out of people,
MELISSA	people trusted her, saw her as a confidant.
MELISSA	Jack was kind of pushing the lawyer thing
MELISSA	but truly I think Ashley’s passion was journalism.
ASHLEY	Good morning Canyon Park High School. I’m Ashley Foster, CPTV.
ASHLEY	Just want to say hello to all the new freshmen in the building.
ASHLEY	Welcome aboard.
ASHLEY	I know locker combinations can be tricky but
ASHLEY	you’ll make it through just like I did so just keep trying.
ASHLEY	Together we’re a team and this is not teamwork.
SOPHIE	That’s cute.
MELISSA	Yeah
SOPHIE	What did you guys think of Josh?
MELISSA	We didn’t know him.
MELISSA	Is that Josh’s yearbook?
SOPHIE	Yeah, Ashley signed it.
MELISSA 	Oh really?
SOPHIE	Yeah. There it is.
MELISSA	Look at that.
MELISSA	I mean he was never one of these kids that came over to the house.
MELISSA	That’s it. Josh Bishop.
SOPHIE	Seems like she had a lot of friends.
MELISSA	She did, yeah. She was a charmer.
ASHLEY	Have you ever heard the story of Ezekie’s wheel?
ASHLEY	It’s from the Bible.
JOSH	Oh. Definitely not.
ASHLEY	Ezekiel describes God coming down from heaven in a chariot.
ASHLEY	It’s lighting up the sky, but all along the outside are eyes.
JOSH	Why would God need a spaceship?
ASHLEY	Exactly, because he is space.
JOSH	All right, we’re done. It’s cool.
ASHLEY	It’s done? Ok. Bye.
JOSH	Thanks for doing it.
CAROLINE	A very sweet girl. I met her a few times.
CAROLINE	I definitely know that Josh had a crush on her and
CAROLINE	I’m hoping…now I’m going to cry, I’m hoping she liked him.
CAROLINE	Just because they spent so much time together It would have been   
CAROLINE	nice to know that he, in his short life, could experience that.
SOPHIE	That’s Ashley’s handwriting.
SOPHIE	And how much do you know about
SOPHIE	what Ashley and Josh were working on?
MELISSA	We certainly didn’t know any of that until later.
JACK	It was after.
JACK	We knew very little. 
ASHLEY	We’re going to meet with some astronomers.
JOSH	Ok.
ASHLEY	They’re going to have rocks and all different kinds of stuff to show us
ASHLEY	so we’ve got to be prepared and we need to make sure that we’re
ASHLEY	on our “A” game.
JOSH	What does our “A” game mean?
ASHLEY	We just have to be professional.
JOSH	I feel like I’ve been pretty professional so far, thank you.
JOSH	I don’t think I’m exactly amateur hour.
ASHLEY	I know, I guess I’m just a little nervous.
ASHLEY	I want everything to go good.
JOSH	Do you have any questions prepared?
ASHLEY	I have a ton, they’re in my backpack. Do you have my backpack by the way?
JOSH	Yeah, I do. 
MARK	Have you ever held a meteorite before?
MARK	I’ll start with this one.
ASHLEY	Whoa!
MARK	We get phone calls about UFO’s kind of frequently.
JOSH	So when the Phoenix Lights happened were people calling and asking? 
DON 	Yeah, they were.
MARK	A few.
ASHLEY	He shot the footage.
MARK	Oh, you shot the footage?
MARK	Congratulations! Can you learn to focus?
STEVE	They’re in a formation of some kind but they’re not really moving.
MARK	Ok, that’s more likely flares.
DON	The flares are probably fifty to a hundred miles away
DON	So you don’t see the smoke, you just see a bright light that
DON	just hangs there because of the parachute
DON	to hold them in place.
ASHLEY	Would you say you’re a hundred percent sure it’s not
ASHLEY	or you’re ninety-nine percent sure and still open to the possibility?
DON	No, I’m a hundred percent sure that that’s what it was.
MARK	Oh. A jet…
DON	It’s an F-18.
JOSH	What was that?
ASHLEY	What did you say Don?
DON	F-18.
ASHLEY	How do you know?
MARK	He’s got the ear for it. 
ASHLEY	All right, I got as close as I could. There’s this creepy guy
ASHLEY	who was just staring me down.
ASHLEY	I think he was about to call security on me.
JOSH	You actually believe it was the Air Force.
JOSH	You believe the bearded…
ASHLEY	I do not!
ASHLEY	I don’t know what I believe yet!
JOSH	…the bearded Galileo Society
JOSH	of Phoenix, Arizona.
JOSH	I’m disappointed. You’re no longer a producer.
ASHLEY	I am absolutely a producer!
ASHLEY	I think I found the section.
JOSH	Ancient UFO sightings.
ASHLEY	Check this out. Petroglyphs.
JOSH	That’s totally a spaceship.
JOSH	Isn’t this that Bible thing you were talking about?
ASHLEY	Ezekiel’s wheel.
JOSH	Wait, I know what this reminds me of.
JOSH	It’s like the machine at the end of “Contact.”
ASHLEY	I love that movie.
ASHLEY	Ok to go.
ASHLEY	Ok to go.
JOSH	Initiate drop sequence.
ASHLEY	Ok to go!
ASHLEY	Oh my God, I think I’m going through a wormhole!
JOSH	I don’t want to seem ungrateful for all the help, but what are we doing here?
JOSH	We should be breaking into Area-51.
ASHLEY	Can you tell us your name and what you do here?
TONY	My name is Tony Duncan, I’m from the Apache Nation.
TONY	For the most part we do a lot of story-telling.
TONY	A lot of our stories of creation talk about how at one time
TONY	we were up in the lights, up in the sky world
TONY	so maybe it was one of our people up there.
ASHLEY	So you saw the lights last week?
TONY	I didn’t see them. I didn’t see them at that exact time
TONY	but I heard everyone’s different stories. But then eventually
TONY	I saw all the footage of it. 
TONY	I first thought of the star people. That must be them, our relatives.
ASHLEY	You said you didn’t see them that exact time.
ASHLEY	What did you mean?
TONY	Yeah. Actually, way before the lights that were seen in Phoenix,
TONY	my friend that I grew up with, his name is Pony,
TONY	we actually saw some lights in the same way
TONY	but they were a lot closer and we followed them.
ASHLEY	Wait…
JOSH	You saw the same formation?
TONY	Yeah. They were in the sky and they’d be here
TONY	and then they would take off really fast and they would move around
TONY	and it was really exciting, and then it went way out into the field.
TONY	We were running way out into the field for a long time,
TONY	our legs were getting all scratched up.
TONY	Eventually it just took off. Away, high upward. We couldn’t see it anymore.
TONY	But we still talk about that, Pony and I.
TONY	But that was over in Salt River in the Salt River Reservation.
ASHLEY	The bus definitely doesn’t go that far.
JOSH	That’s where we’re going.
ASHLEY	Well, that’s where we’re deciding if we should go to be more accurate.
JOSH	Are you serious? What, are you scared of sky people?
JOSH	I’m being taken to the spirit world with the Anasazi…
ASHLEY	Well I kind of believed him.
JOSH	Please come. I need my producer, you know.
JOSH	I think it would make a really sick documentary.
JOSH	I’m going to show it to colleges or…somebody.
ASHLEY	How do we get there?
JOSH	That’s for me.
CAROLINE	Ok. Mark!
MARK	Misses Bishop.
CAROLINE	I haven’t seen you in so long.
MARK	I know, how are you?
CAROLINE	Good, how are you?
MARK	Hey. You look great.
CAROLINE	Thank you.
JOSH	Did you do something with your hair?
CAROLINE	Just got it done.
JOSH	Are you serious?
CAROLINE	Thanks for noticing
MARK	No problem.
JOSH	Can you stop flirting with my mom?
MARK	I’m not flirting with your mom.
MARK	She does look pretty good though.
JOSH	All right, go.
MARK	And let’s not forget our most important piece of equipment… 
MARK	on this journey…
MARK	my 1994 Grand Jeep Cherokee.
MARK	Six-cylinder engine, blood-red finish, roof racks…
MARK	16inch clearance, perfect for maneuvering over any desert…
JOSH	Sorry.
REPORTER #1	...phenomenon has returned.
JOSH	Oh, shit.
REPORTER #1	For the second time in one week… 
REPORTER #1	mysterious lights have been spotted over the Phoenix area…
JOSH	Yo, Mark! Look at this!
REPORTER #1	 this time over the suburb of Mesa.
REPORTER #1	The sightings fascinated residents.
DAVID FELD	It was completely silent. You couldn’t hear it…
DAVID FELD	but you knew it was there. It was just massive, it was big.
REPORTER #1	Eye-witnesses describe what they saw as being identical… 
REPORTER #1	to the glowing orbs that passed through the area earlier this week…
MARK	Is that them? Are those your aliens?
REPORTER #1	a mysterious “V” formation that flew from west to east.  
REPORTER #1	The video you’re seeing right now was captured in Mesa…
JOSH	Dude, I know where this is.
REPORTER #1	about ten miles from the…
JOSH	Wait, this is it, here on the right. Right, right, right, right! Go!
MARK	Shit.
JOSH	Go, go, go, go!
MARK	Let me know a little earlier next time.   
MARK	Jeez, man.
MARK	Dang.
JOSH	This is it. This is where they were, right over that ridge.
MARK	Well, whatever they were they’re long gone now.
JOSH	Dude. 
JOSH	Well, dude, check this out.  
JOSH	Somebody’s up there.
MARK	You do realize we gotta get up in like six hours, right?
JOSH	Dude, we’re almost to the top.
MARK	Get down.
MARK	Dude, kill the light. What are you doing? Josh?
MARK	Josh, let’s get the hell out of here.
JOSH	Just hang on.
MARK	Man, those are cops up there.
JOSH	Dude, there’s no plates.
THEN MARK	I don’t care, let’s go.
MARK	They’re just cops.
JOSH	Dude, cops don’t walk around in the middle of the night with telescopes. 
JOSH	They’re looking for it.
MARK	What?
JOSH	The UFO.
MARK	Josh, I don’t care. Let’s go.
JOSH	That’s what they’re looking for.
JOSH	Oh, my God.
MAN	Hey!
JOSH	Oh shit! 
MARK	Run, bitch!
JOSH	Okay, so this is the first sighting right above South Mountain.  
JOSH	This is the second.  
JOSH	And this is where we’re going… 
JOSH	right in the flight path of the first two. Nobody knows about this, I told you.
MARK	I guess we’ll find out tomorrow.
JAY	This was an unusual case.
SOPHIE	What do you mean it was unusual?  In what sense?
JAY	It’s very uncommon to have three kids go missing at the same time.
SOPHIE	Just because there were three of them?
JAY	There were three, yeah. 
JAY	Usually one, maybe two, boyfriend-girlfriend…
JAY	but the fact that there were three, you know… 
JAY	set it outside of the norm.
SOPHIE	What did you guys use to get to drink?
DAN	I always got lemonade…
DAN	but Mark, he’d always go for a suicide.  
DAN	All the way down. Dash of everything.
SOPHIE	Do you remember the night that you got the call?
DAN	Sure. Yeah.  
DAN	I was in my first year at ASU… 
DAN	and I got a call late at night from my mom… 
DAN	saying that Mark hadn’t come home.  
DAN	My dad was convinced that I’d taken him to some frat party…
DAN	and gotten him drunk. He was pissed off.  
DAN	He was even more pissed than Ashley’s dad, if you can believe that.  
DAN	My mom told me that if I just got them home ASAP… 
DAN	I wouldn’t get in trouble. They just refused to believe me. 
DAN	I didn’t realize at the time…
DAN	that I was the last reasonable explanation that they had…
DAN	before they started to freak out for real.
OFFICER	Officer (unintelligible).
DISPATCHER 	Is someone there?
OFFICER	Possible 11-24 on the side of the highway. 
DISPATCHER	Do you have (unintelligible)?
OFFICER	No, no one inside. 
OFFICER	Copy that, 11-24.
DISPATCHER 	10-4.
SOPHIE	Should I put my phone in airplane mode?
KEVIN	It won’t affect the flight at all if you don’t put it in.
SOPHIE	All right. I use that on planes.
KEVIN	Yeah, that’s bull crap.
SOPHIE	The reason I wanted to talk to you was because you were involved…
SOPHIE	in the search for my brother.
KEVIN	I was.
SOPHIE	Can you tell me a little bit about that?
KEVIN	Strange case.
KEVIN	That’s where the car was found.
SOPHIE	Right down there?
SOPHIE	Do you think someone could have forced them off the road?
WALTER	It’s possible, but I doubt it.
WALTER	It seems like they left the car here intentionally.
SOPHIE	What do you mean intentionally?
WALTER	Oh, the car was parked perfectly in line.  
WALTER	So it didn’t seem like they were in a rush or anything.  
WALTER	The doors were locked. We didn’t find the keys.
JAY	It was functional. It ran.
JAY	It wasn’t like it ran out of gas or the battery died out there. 
JAY	They were able to start it up.
WALTER	And we found some beers in the car.
SOPHIE	Some beers? Like they were drinking or something?
WALTER	Yeah, just a couple of beers.
WALTER	We really don’t know if that means anything.  
WALTER	There were traces of blood and we think it was Mark’s.
WALTER	And your brother’s camera, of course.
CAROLINE	This is the one they found in the car.
MARK	The Diamondbacks are the snakes that you want to look out for.  
MARK	Some dude died.
MARK	I guess he was climbing over,  like, a ridge…
MARK	and it struck, and it hit him in the neck.
JOSH	You dick!
MARK	 What?
JOSH	 Are you serious?  What about her parents, huh?
MARK	You’re the one who wants to hit the road.
JOSH	You want to get in trouble before we even leave?  God.
MARK	Now she comes out. 
JOSH	Well I guess it worked.
ASHLEY	It’s 7:30 in the morning, you dicks.
MARK	All right, well, there’s a lot of dicks getting thrown at the driver now.
ASHLEY	What?
MARK	All right, you guys ready?
ASHLEY	Josh, do you have all the equipment in here?
MARK	Can you move your camera?
JOSH	Yeah, no, we’re good, we’re good.
ASHLEY	Are you sure we shouldn’t double check?
ASHLEY	Because once we’re gone we’re gone. Okay, go, go, please drive.
MARK	What?
ASHLEY 	It’s just I don’t want to talk to my dad.
JOSH	He looks like a sweet man.
ASHLEY	Yeah, until you meet him.
ASHLEY	Wait, when do you guys have to be home by?
MARK	My parents aren’t as concerned.  
MARK	My mom just like won’t go to sleep until I’m home.
ASHLEY	Different when you’re a girl…
MARK	No, no, a hundred percent.
ASHLEY	than two men.
ASHLEY	Hey look! Look, Josh.
MARK	It would say Interstate.
ASHLEY	Look at this. It looks like those petroglyphs in that book.
MARK	Those were clearly made by alien spacecraft.
ASHLEY	Quick, shoot that.
LYRICS	Arizona, take off your hobo shoes.  
LYRICS	Arizona… 
LYRICS	hey won’tcha go my way.
MARK	I can do it.
MARK	I can tell ‘em a little something. Unh.  Arizona. Unh. 
MARK	So hot and fresh, giving me a boner. Unh. Rock and roller.  
MARK	Bowler. Coca-Cola. Solar plexus.  
MARK	‘Cause we’re better than Texas.  
MARK	‘Cause we’re so big and fierce, call us T-Rexes. 
MARK	Look at our faces, I know you wanna sex us!  Whoo!
LYRICS	Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
LYRICS	Arizona…
LYRICS	have another look at the world
WALTER	What happened between here and when they left the car…
WALTER	you see that’s the mystery.  
KEVIN	People that are on the ground tell you that, hey…
KEVIN	the one gal has a bright yellow shirt or something.
KEVIN	So that’s something that you’re gonna try to key on as looking down.  
KEVIN	And you just go back and forth, kind of like mowing the yard.
JAY	It looks very flat from the air but when you get down on the ground…
JAY	and you start walking around even the smallest bit of terrain…
JAY	there is a lot of places they could be.
REPORTER #3	Now anyone with any information about the case…
REPORTER #3	is asked to call a special tip line…
KEVIN	If you’d have asked me at the front end…
KEVIN	“are we going to find these kids”, I would have said yeah.
KEVIN	Oh yeah, we’ll find them.
KEVIN	Three things to look for. Three shirts.  
KEVIN	I don’t want to be morbid, but three bodies.
KEVIN	I mean, there’s more to search for. We just found nothing.
SOPHIE	So if you were to speculate, what do you think happened to them?
KEVIN	Maybe if I wasn’t on camera or something… 
KEVIN	I think maybe I could give you some opinions…
KEVIN	but it’s hard to speculate.
SOPHIE	Okay. So what do you think happened?
KEVIN	There’s potentially some sort of relationship issue.
KEVIN	One boy likes the girl and the girl likes the other boy…
KEVIN	and the two boys find out about the issue.
JAY	Maybe somebody came along and picked them up…
JAY	and could have taken them somewhere…
JAY	but they should have surfaced.
WALTER	Foul play is possible but it’s very tough if only one person did it…
WALTER	it’s very difficult to hold three people, you know, together.
KEVIN	It could just be someone out there that’s running some dope.
SOPHIE	And they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
KEVIN	They were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Stumble upon…
KEVIN	something that was five miles from where they were…
KEVIN	where the vehicle was located and they were driven to that location.  
KEVIN	Like I said, we didn’t find anything so who knows what happened.  
KEVIN	Hard to speculate.
ASHLEY	How did you meet Josh?
MARK	I feel weird talking about this ‘cause I know he’s gonna watch it later.
MARK	We met in church actually.
ASHLEY	Really?
MARK	Yeah. Everybody called Josh, “Ginger”…
MARK	and they were making fun of him, like, calling him “ginger”…
MARK	because of his red hair but when I was little I didn’t know…
MARK	“Ginger” was a name for redheads.  I just thought it was a nickname…
MARK	like, specifically for Josh.  
MARK	So I just thought the coolest kid at Sunday school… 
MARK	like everybody knew who he was so I went out of my way to hang out with him.  
MARK	And that’s when we started becoming friends.
ASHLEY	I just got some B-roll, but I got some really cool cactuses…
ASHLEY	and I was trying to get Phoenix in the background.
JOSH	Were you guys filming me while I was asleep?
ASHLEY	No.
MARK	No. Never.
ASHLEY	Okay, a little bit.
MARK	Can you put your seatbelt back on, please?
ASHLEY	 Yeah.
ASHLEY	Literally nothing out here.  
ASHLEY	Hello!
MARK	You’re gonna get your head taken off by one of those.
ASHLEY	I want to live here.
MARK	You want to live here?
ASHLEY	Yeah, maybe. Whoa, whoa, watch out!
MARK	Sorry guys. My bad.  
MARK	Whoa, check that out.
JOSH	What? What is it?
MARK	Dead animal. A coyote?
JOSH	Is it two?
MARK	Yeah. Yeah, it is.
JOSH	Hold on, this camera sucks.
SOPHIE	So that’s it?
CAROLINE	That’s it.
CAROLINE	That’s the last he shot.
SOPHIE	Hang on.
SOPHIE	So Josh went all the way out there…
SOPHIE	and then he just didn’t shoot anything past the road?  
SOPHIE	Doesn’t that seem weird to you?
WALTER	I always thought it was a little odd.
SOPHIE	Why?  Why odd?
WALTER	Well your brother…
WALTER	he seemed to have that camera glued to his face all the time.
WALTER	It just didn’t make any sense to leave it behind.
SOPHIE	So do you think maybe they had a second camera?
SOPHIE	Like, is that a possibility?
JAY	I thought about that.  
JAY	I still think your brother would have had that with him.
JAY	I know Ashley had access to those camera equipment…
JAY	and could check out but I don’t remember…
JAY	anything being unaccounted for at the time.  
JAY	We ran that thread out as far as we could and we just couldn’t take it…
JAY	and law enforcement couldn’t take it anywhere either.
SOPHIE	So that’s what the kids would have been using back in ’97, right?
LUISA	It’s a little before my time, but yeah, probably.
SOPHIE	Do you still have any of those old cameras laying around?
LUISA	Yeah.
ASHLEY	I’m Ashley Foster, CPTV.  
ASHLEY	Just want to say hello to all the new freshmen in the building…
ASHLEY	welcome aboard.
LUISA	Where did you get this?
SOPHIE	This was found in Mark Abrams Jeep…
SOPHIE	after he went missing with Ashley and with my brother.  
SOPHIE	We think Josh had a second camera with him on the trip.  
SOPHIE	If he did have one it most likely came from the school…
SOPHIE	so I was wondering if you thought Ashley could have…
SOPHIE	checked one out from here, like……
SOPHIE	Maybe she used a different name?
LUISA	It’s possible…
LUISA	But like I said, it was before I started.
SOPHIE	Would there have been like a logbook or records of that?
SOPHIE	Stuff that might have been…
LUISA	It’s been 20 years.  
LUISA	I’m so sorry I can’t be of more help to you.
SOPHIE	Even if they had a second camera it just, it went missing with them. 
SOPHIE	Just another dead end, you know?
REPORTER #4	And new developments tonight.  
REPORTER #4	Rescuers were forced to call off their search for three missing teens…
REPORTER #4	saying there is no new credible evidence or clues… 
REPORTER #4	to guide the search.
STEVE	It’s like they’ve been written off.  
STEVE	They’ve been, my son and his friends have been abandoned… 
STEVE	by the police department.
JAY	All the efforts by law enforcement to develop some evidence… 
JAY	as to what happened, they were pretty…
JAY	well they were negative. They could never go anywhere with the case.
STEVE	I think if they had kids they’d want somebody looking for their kid.
MELISSA	Dear Ashley, I know that you’re alive… 
MELISSA	and that you can hear my voice right now.  
MELISSA	You can’t imagine how much your father and I miss you and love you.  
MELISSA	Every night I have a dream that I come downstairs…
MELISSA	and you’re sitting at the table like you were never even gone.
MELISSA	I know this means something.  
MELISSA	I know it means that you are still alive.
MELISSA	Your father and I will never give up hope.  
MELISSA	I love you, Ashley. Please come home.
MELISSA	I wanted a funeral…In Loving Memory of Ashley Foster
MELISSA	but Jack wouldn’t have it. 
MELISSA	So here we are.
SOPHIE	The bench was a compromise?
MELISSA	Yep. That’s what marriage is about.
JAY	Sophie, I don’t think your brother’s alive.  
JAY	I don’t think he is.  I think something would have developed.
SOPHIE	Jay, get in here.
CAMERAMAN	What’s up?
SOPHIE	Have you seen this?
GOVERNOR	If you’d been here ten years ago and standing out here…
GOVERNOR	and looking up there at the lights and the view…
GOVERNOR	you would have been astounded.  
GOVERNOR	You would have been amazed.
CAMERAMAN	Is that the governor?
SOPHIE	Yeah. 20 years ago he said the lights were a joke. 
SOPHIE	He had a whole press conference making fun of them.  
SOPHIE	Now he’s saying he saw the lights that night. 
SOPHIE	He’s basically admitting he lied.
REPORTER #5	The former Governor, a Vietnam Air Force veteran…
REPORTER #5	had never publicly acknowledged seeing it until now.
GOVERNOR	And I suspect that unless the Defense Department…
GOVERNOR	proves this otherwise that it was probably… 
GOVERNOR	some form of an alien spacecraft.
GOVERNOR	And I think as a public figure you have to be very careful… 
GOVERNOR	about what you say because people can have pretty…
GOVERNOR	emotional reactions.
CAMERAMAN	Is that him?
SOPHIE	Okay, follow me. Just keep rolling.  
SOPHIE	Excuse me, Mr. Garland?  Hi, I’m Sophie Bishop.  
SOPHIE	We spoke on the phone.
GARLAND	I’m sorry, I can’t help you.
SOPHIE	Right, I just have a couple questions.  
SOPHIE	You worked for the governor from 1992 until he resigned in ’97… 
SOPHIE	is that right?
GARLAND	Sophie, I don’t know anything…
GARLAND	about your brother.
SOPHIE	Okay, what about the Phoenix Lights?
SOPHIE	On March 15th, 1997 you went on TV…
SOPHIE	and you said that they were military flares.  
SOPHIE	Did you see the Governor on CNN saying that was a lie?  
SOPHIE	You were his Press Secretary at the time.
GARLAND	Listen, I really am very sorry about your brother.  
GARLAND	We were just trying not to create a panic.
SOPHIE	Who told you to lie?
SOPHIE	I mean what if Josh was on to something?
SOPHIE	We always assumed he got lost or kidnapped…
SOPHIE	or murdered but what if…?
CAMERAMAN	What if he got abducted by aliens?
SOPHIE	Jesus, I sound like him, don’t I?
CAMERAMAN	So now what?
SOPHIE	I don’t know. 
SOPHIE	I don’t know what we’re doing here anymore.
CAROLINE	I can’t believe you’re leaving.  It feels like you just got here.
SOPHIE	Can I ask you one more question?  
SOPHIE	Why did you and Dad decide to call it quits?
CAROLINE	Sweetheart, everyone’s divorced now.
SOPHIE	I want to know. Was it Josh’s disappearance…
SOPHIE	or would you guys have split up anyway?
ASHLEY	Hello!
MARK	You’re going to get your head taken off by one of those.
ASHLEY	I want to live here.
MARK	You want to live here?
ASHLEY	 Yeah. Maybe.
ASHLEY	Josh, you want to stop here?
STEVE	Well, how is she?
SOPHIE	She’s good.  
SOPHIE	Just getting ready for the big move, you know?
STEVE	Well, please tell her, you know, if she needs any help or anything… 
STEVE	she should call me.
JACK	Somebody knows what happened.
DAN	Mark didn’t just wander off into the desert. He didn’t get lost. 
DAN	That never made sense to me.
SOPHIE	If Josh hadn’t gone missing…
SOPHIE	do you think you and Mom would still be together?
STEVE	Yeah. What’d she say?
CAROLINE	Sweetheart, what happened was your brother went missing. 
CAROLINE	Completely missing. And it took over our lives.
REPORTER #6	…resources to make sure these teenagers are found.
JOSH	If that’s true then what was it, you know?  I don’t know.
CAROLINE	Is Josh dead? Is he alive? Was he suffering? 
CAROLINE	Our relationship became about all those questions…
CAROLINE	and your father, he couldn’t do it anymore…
CAROLINE	and still be the man that I fell in love with and I couldn’t do it anymore…
CAROLINE	and still be his wife.
STEVE	Everybody keeps criticizing me, you know, for not dealing with it.  
STEVE	I was the only one who was still out there…
STEVE	trying to figure out what happened to your brother.
SOPHIE	Do you think there’s ever going to be a point where you can let it go, Dad?
STEVE	I mean, show me his body.
STEVE	Good to see you.
SOPHIE	Love you.
STEVE	I love you, too.
SOPHIE	Okay.
STEVE	All right. Do me a favor, when you get home give me a call, okay?
SOPHIE	Okay.
STEVE	Let me know you got in okay.
SOPHIE	Yeah.
STEVE	Okay.
STEVE	We’re going to see you Christmas?
SOPHIE	Yeah, I’ll see you Christmas.
STEVE	Okay.
SOPHIE	Okay.
STEVE	All right.
SOPHIE	Love you.
STEVE	I love you.
SOPHIE	Bye, Dad.
STEVE	 Bye.
LUISA	Hi Sophie, this is Luisa.  Luisa Moreno. 
LUISA	We spoke several months ago at Canyon Park High.  
LUISA	Just call me back when you can.
SOPHIE	Hi. 
SOPHIE	Thank you so much for meeting me.
LUISA	Yeah.
LUISA	Did you have a hard time finding the place?
SOPHIE	No, no, not at all.
LUISA	Great.
LUISA	This place has been on the books since the late seventies.  
LUISA	Pretty much anything old or outdated gets thrown in here. 
LUISA	I was throwing away some garbage over the weekend… 
LUISA	and just saw it sitting in the drawer. 
LUISA	Somebody must have thrown it in here and forgotten about it.
SOPHIE	Can I take this?
LUISA	Oh, it’s yours.
DAN	I know you’re excited about this…
DAN	but I just don’t want you to get your hopes up, you know?
SOPHIE	Yeah, I know. 
SOPHIE	Is that a tape?
SOPHIE	Be careful.
DAN	I know.
DAN	Okay.
SOPHIE	That’s Ashley’s handwriting.
DAN	Really?
DAN	Holy shit.
SOPHIE	Hit play.
DAN	I’m going to let you do this.
SOPHIE	All right, you ready?
DAN	Ready.
SOPHIE	Hi. Sophie Bishop. 
SOPHIE	I have an appointment with Captain Groves.
GUARD	ID’s please.
GUARD	Just pull over to the side, ma’am. 
GUARD	I need you to wait right over there.
SOPHIE	Okay. Is there a problem?
SOPHIE	We should have an appointment.
GUARD	Yes ma’am. I need you to wait right over there.
SOPHIE	Okay.  
SOPHIE	What’s it been, like an hour?
SOPHIE	That’s him. 
SOPHIE	Okay, just stay here, keep it low. 
CAPTAIN	Miss Bishop?
SOPHIE	Hi.
CAPTAIN GROVES	Hi there. Captain Groves.  
SOPHIE	Hi.
CAPTAIN GROVES	Sorry to keep you waiting.
SOPHIE	It’s fine.
SOPHIE	So we can do the interview out here or in your office…
SOPHIE	whichever you prefer.
CAPTAIN	Yeah, that’s not going to happen.
SOPHIE	I’m sorry, what?
CAPTAIN GROVES	There’s not going to be an interview.
SOPHIE	Okay. When we spoke on the phone you said that it was fine…
SOPHIE	so I guess I’m just wondering what happened… 
SOPHIE	that made you change your mind.
CAPTAIN GROVES	I understand.
CAPTAIN GROVES	That’s really all I can say.
SOPHIE	Did you watch the footage?
CAPTAIN GROVES	Drive safe.
CAMERAMAN	You okay?
SOPHIE	Yeah, I just honestly wasn’t expecting that.
CAMERAMAN	What did he say?
SOPHIE	He said, “Don’t let that footage get out”.
CAMERAMAN	What do you want to do?
SOPHIE	What do you think Josh would do?
JOSH	This is gonna be rad. 
JOSH	Dude.
MARK	Yeah.
JOSH	Look at its eye.
MARK	Yeah.
JOSH	This camera is amazing.
MARK	Yo, don’t get too close.
JOSH	It smells burnt.
MARK	It’s like males competing for females.
JOSH	They have the same burns.
JOSH	Countless stories, when UFO’s have been sighted about like... 
JOSH	animal experimentation.
MARK	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
MARK	They just got cooked by the sun.
MARK	Oh shit.
MARK	This way.
MARK	Obviously I’m joking.
ASHLEY	You just said you look like older Leo.
MARK	People told me that when Romeo and Juliet came out.
ASHLEY	What, they said that you...?
MARK	That literally made me more popular in school.
JOSH	What are you guys talking about?
ASHLEY	 What?
JOSH	What are you guys talking about?
MARK	 You.
JOSH	Just at the top of that ridge. 
JOSH	We wouldn’t be able to see anything from down here.
MARK	Not like we’re gonna see anything up there, either.
JOSH	Don’t be that guy. We don’t need that guy.
ASHLEY	You remember where we parked the car, right?
MARK	Yeah. It’s that a-way.
ASHLEY	Ooh, Josh.
MARK	Oh shit.
ASHLEY	Come look at this.
JOSH	 What do you got?
ASHLEY	Whoa. Petroglyphs.  
 JOSH	Oh!
ASHLEY	Guess this means....
ASHLEY	 we’re on the right track.
MARK	Wow. Ancient graffiti.
MARK	Now what you see below me are Native American petroglyphs.  
MARK	They were probably put here hundreds of years ago...
MARK	by the Apache. They were native to these lands...
MARK	very adept at living in these mountainous regions.  
MARK	The spiral shape that you see below us...
MARK	historians aren’t quite sure what it could have represented.  
MARK	It could have represented ripples in water...
MARK	things that they saw in the sky...
MARK	and that’s pretty much it.  Petroglyphs.
ASHLEY	Please be careful.
MARK	You get that?
JOSH	 Yeah.
MARK	It look steep?
JOSH	Yeah.
ASHLEY	You guys are idiots.
ASHLEY	I should not have smoked that cigarette.
ASHLEY	Whoa. 
ASHLEY	How far do you want us to go, Josh?
JOSH	Just keep going.
ASHLEY	I’m wheezing. I’m out of breath. 
ASHLEY	Whoa.
MARK	You rolling?
JOSH	Yeah.
MARK	Check this out. Oh, shit.
JOSH	What? Where’d you get those?
MARK	Ask Diane Sawyer over there.
ASHLEY	I got it from a guy at the gas station.
MARK	Here. He had a crush on you or something.
ASHLEY	I just used my eyes. Yeah.
MARK	We have two more in here, too.
ASHLEY	Dude, no, no. Do not film this.
MARK	Is Josh filming this?
JOSH	Whoa. Will you please be as careful as possible with that on a cliff edge?
ASHLEY	Sorry.
JOSH	Where’s Mark?
ASHLEY	He’s taking a leak.
JOSH	Oh, you didn’t want to go with him?
ASHLEY	 Shut up.
JOSH	What are you doing?
ASHLEY	It’s my turn to interview you.
ASHLEY	See how you like it.
JOSH	It’s not a Hitchcock movie, you know?  
JOSH	The director isn’t in this one.
MARK	You guys playing Truth or Dare up here?
MARK	What?
ASHLEY	Want to play Truth or Dare?  
JOSH	Yeah.
ASHLEY	You go first.
MARK	You actually want to play?
ASHLEY	Yeah, why not?
JOSH	Come on.
JOSH	I’ve got a couple beers in me.
MARK	Dare.
ASHLEY	 Okay. I dare you to tell the truth.
MARK	That is not how you play the game.
JOSH	 It’s fair enough.
MARK	That is how I play the game.
JOSH	What’s the deal with you and Debbie Gomez?
ASHLEY	Debbie Gomez?
MARK	Why?
JOSH	Well, the old rumor mill’s been, you know...
MARK	We hang out sometimes, like I don’t...
JOSH	Do you guys play tennis or go golfing?
MARK	Why are you being a dick, dude?  Like, we hang out.  Like, it’s not...
ASHLEY	Why didn’t you invite her here?
MARK	I don’t know, I didn’t want to make it weird.
JOSH	What do you mean make it weird?
ASHLEY	Why would that be weird?
MARK	I didn’t want to make it like a double date.
ASHLEY	Wait, now that’s weird. 
JOSH	Oh, come on, man.
ASHLEY	All right, we cannot stay here forever. 
ASHLEY	We need to go as soon as the sun dips down.
JOSH	Just hold on and enjoy it for a second, please. 
JOSH	I just want to get this, it’s gorgeous.
MARK	 Josh.
JOSH	 What?
MARK	What is that? 
JOSH	 What?
ASHLEY	What?
MARK	That.
MARK	No, no, what is that? 
MARK	Ashley.
ASHLEY	Whoa, what?
ASHLEY	 Wait, Mark, isn’t that... 
ASHLEY	What?
MARK	It’s just kind of sitting there.
ASHLEY	Wait, isn’t the Luke Air Force Base over there?
JOSH	Yeah.
MARK	Maybe.
JOSH	 Probably just something from the Air Force Base.
ASHLEY	That’s probably what it is.
JOSH	Maybe a helicopter.
MARK	You’re the one looking for UFO’s...
MARK	I’m just pointing it out.
ASHLEY	No, that’s not a helicopter.
ASHLEY	We’d hear it if it was a helicopter.
JOSH	Hold on.
ASHLEY	Wait. Okay, you guys.  
JOSH	 Do you think it’s a fighter jet?
MARK	No, that’s not a fighter jet.
ASHLEY	Don’t get ahead of yourself...
ASHLEY	all right? It’s just a light.
MARK	It’s not a fighter jet.
MARK	It’s not. You’d hear it, you’d hear it.
ASHLEY	What? Oh, my God.
JOSH	Okay, okay.
MARK	Whoa!
MARK	Holy shit!
ASHLEY	What!
MARK	Josh, did you get that?
JOSH	Hold on.
MARK	 What was that?
ASHLEY	 Wait, tell me you got that on camera.
JOSH	Yes!
MARK	 Can you play that back?? 
ASHLEY	Oh, my God!
MARK	Guys, stop, stop, stop.
ASHLEY	Josh. Wait, Josh, seriously though.
JOSH	This is the greatest day of my life.
ASHLEY	 Oh, my... Did you know that was gonna happen?
JOSH	Here, give me that back.
MARK	Did you know that was gonna happen?
MARK	Is Luke Air Force Base that way?
JOSH	Luke Air Force Base is that way but that’s not Air Force.
MARK	How do you know?
ASHLEY	You don’t know that.
JOSH	 Because it’s not 21-50
JOSH	Come back.
MARK	All right, man...
ASHLEY	 Twenty minutes.
MARK	Get like a last pan or whatever and let’s go. 
MARK	Dude, come on. I’m happy for you, let’s go.
JOSH	Just ten more minutes, though?
MARK	 No. You’ve done that like twice...
MARK	and we need to get back.
ASHLEY	You know how hard it’s gonna be...
ASHLEY	 to walk through this canyon in the dark?
JOSH	 I don’t see what the problem is, okay?  
JOSH	You know the way back.
ASHLEY	It’s already dark.
MARK	 The problem is that it starts to get really dark and really cold...
MARK	and she has a curfew and I still have to drive.
ASHLEY	Please.
MARK	Come on. Cut. We gotta go.
 ASHLEY	All right, we’re leaving.
JOSH	What if we get arrested by like the Air Force or something?
MARK	That would actually be the scariest situation.
JOSH	Like our parents don’t ever find out like what’s going to happen to us.  
JOSH	The Air Force just takes us away or something.
MARK	That’d be so sad.
JOSH	My mom would think I was just in my room playing with the camera.  
MARK	They wouldn’t notice?
JOSH	It would take a couple years I think.
ASHLEY	My parents are noticing right now.
MARK	You good?
ASHLEY	Yeah.
JOSH	Mark. Mark!
MARK	Sorry.
ASHLEY	Whoa.
MARK	Give it to me.
MARK	Give me that. Give me the UFO.
JOSH	After tonight you can be Producer, Assistant Director.
JOSH	You know what? If you’re lucky we can talk Co.
ASHLEY	We can what?
JOSH	We can talk Co.
ASHLEY	 All right.
JOSH	Co-Director.
MARK	He’s three years older than me.
JOSH	His brother voted for Dole.
MARK	No, he didn’t.
ASHLEY	Bob Dole? Really?
JOSH	Yes he did. Your brother’s a moron.
MARK	 Are you kidding me?
MARK	He’s an engineering student.
ASHLEY	He’s anti-abortion, and like...
MARK	He’s an engineering student. He’s actually very smart. 
MARK	He’s gonna be president one day.
ASHLEY	Is this a dead end?
MARK	No, you just gotta keep going through.
ASHLEY	Are you sure it’s not a dead end?
MARK	I’m positive it’s not a dead end.
ASHLEY	-All right.
MARK	We walked through here in the daytime.
JOSH	Does it usually get this tight?
MARK	Yeah.
MARK	We’re good. It goes on for a while.
ASHLEY	I’m gonna be in so much trouble.
MARK	You guys need help?
JOSH	It’s worth being in trouble. Do you understand what we’ve seen today?
ASHLEY	Yeah, but I can push it like an hour but any longer it’s...
ASHLEY	We would’ve noticed these on the way in for sure. 
ASHLEY	I don’t remember these.
JOSH	Yeah, I for sure would have noticed these. Mark are you sure we passed-
ASHLEY	Mark where are we going?
MARK	Hold on, I’ll be super sure, hold on.
ASHLEY	Are you sure we’re going the right way?
MARK	Yes.
JOSH	Why can’t you just use the stars, man?
ASHLEY	Josh.
MARK	No, it’s this way.
ASHLEY	Are you positive?
MARK	Yep.
ASHLEY	All right.
JOSH	Do you guys not hear that?
ASHLEY	What?
MARK	What?  
ASHLEY	Josh, come on.
JOSH	Everything just looks like rocks.
MARK	I know where we are...
MARK	I’ve been leading you the whole day!
ASHLEY	Yeah, but you keep going left then right, then left then right.
MARK	You keep complaining about us being late, so can we go? 
MARK	I know exactly where we’re going.
JOSH	I mean who else are we gonna listen to anyway?
ASHLEY	Okay, let’s go. What way?
MARK	Hold on. Just stop moving. Let me look first.
JOSH	I definitely heard that.
ASHLEY	I just heard something.
ASHLEY	Guys. Get down. Get down.  
ASHLEY	Mark, get down. 
ASHLEY	What is that?
JOSH	It could be a train.
ASHLEY	I didn’t see any tracks out here.
MARK	Shh. Just listen.
MARK	Okay, we’re almost back.
ASHLEY	Let’s get the hell out of here.
MARK	Let’s go.
ASHLEY	Everybody walk faster.
MARK	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It’s okay. 
MARK	 Ash, it’s all right.
ASHLEY	We need to get out of here now.
MARK	I know. Just calm down.
ASHLEY	Josh, do you recognize any of this?
ASHLEY	Give me the compass.
MARK	Look, do you want to try?
JOSH	Guys.
ASHLEY	 Yes! Give me the compass.
MARK	Get us home.
ASHLEY	Okay, I will.
MARK	You do it.
ASHLEY	I will!
ASHLEY	Okay, so, we came from this way.  
ASHLEY	We got this way. It’s definitely not this way.
JOSH	Mark? Mark, where you going?
MARK	Just stay there.
JOSH	Mark, where you going?
MARK	 I’m gonna find the car from up here!
MARK	You’re not gonna see anything up there, it’s pitch black.
ASHLEY	Hey Josh? Can you come look at this?
JOSH	What?
ASHLEY	It’s just not working.
JOSH	Why would it do that?
ASHLEY	I don’t know.
ASHLEY	Whoa!  What is that? 
ASHLEY	Oh, my God, what is that?  
ASHLEY	Josh, I don’t like this.
JOSH	Hold on, wait. Just stay still.
JOSH	Where is it coming from?
ASHLEY	I don’t know.
JOSH	Ashley.
ASHLEY	Oh, my God.
JOSH	Oh, my God!
ASHLEY	Josh! 
JOSH	Ashley, run! Run! 
JOSH	Oh, my God! Get down! Get down!  
JOSH	Jesus Christ! 
JOSH	Jesus Christ!
JOSH	Holy shit.
JOSH	Oh, my God.
ASHLEY	Oh, my God.
ASHLEY	Josh? Josh? Are you ok?
JOSH	Yeah, you?
ASHLEY	 Yeah.
JOSH	Your hands are shaking.
ASHLEY	 I’m scared.
JOSH	What was that?
ASHLEY	I don’t know.
ASHLEY	Oh, Mark!  Are you all right?
JOSH	Mark, tell me you saw that, man.
MARK	I saw the car.
JOSH	You saw the what?
MARK	I saw the car. It’s close.
JOSH	You saw the car?
ASHLEY	 What are you talking about?
MARK	Come on.
ASHLEY	Mark, where are you going?
MARK	I don’t know.
MARK	Can we just get the hell out of here, please?
ASHLEY	No, wait!
JOSH	Mark! Mark!
MARK	Let’s go!
ASHLEY	 Okay, Mark, slow down!
JOSH	Tell me you saw that, man.
ASHLEY	 Wait.
MARK	Can we just get the hell out of here, please?
ASHLEY	I think we should have a group huddle first.
JOSH	Mark, what was that?
JOSH	Come on, man, what did you see?
MARK	Josh, I need you to stop talking until we find the car.
ASHLEY	You’re sure the car’s over here?
MARK	Yes, I’m positive the car’s over here.
JOSH	Can we please talk about what we got on tape?
ASHLEY	Oh yes! The car!
MARK	I told you.
ASHLEY	Thank God.
MARK	We’re not gonna see anything, Josh.
MARK	Josh, get your ass in the car.
JOSH	Ah, come on, what if they come back?
MARK	I swear to God, I’ll leave you. Let’s go.
JOSH	Just five minutes, man.
ASHLEY	 Come on. Get in the car.
ASHLEY	 You really didn’t see anything?
MARK	I thought I did. I thought I saw these, um...
JOSH	Like circles?
MARK	 No, dumbass. Like rings.
MARK	And they were above me and then they were gone.
ASHLEY	Wait, rings like the petroglyphs?
MARK	Did you guys not see these? 
MARK	All right, it was obviously in my head, all right? Let’s just go.
ASHLEY	Oh shit. Oh shit.
JOSH	There we go.
ASHLEY	 Oh thank God.  
ASHLEY	You guys, what the hell just happened to us?
JOSH	No one has ever filmed anything like that before.
MARK	Let’s just get out of here.
MARK	Signs of civilization.
ASHLEY	I know. It feels so nice to listen to music.
MARK	You’re gonna be real famous, Josh.
ASHLEY	I think he will be.
JOSH	 Thank you.
MARK	Yeah, until they think it’s all faked.
ASHLEY	Are you okay, Mark?
MARK	Yeah.
ASHLEY	Are you sure?
MARK	Yeah, I’m fine.
ASHLEY	 Your head feels a little bit hot.
MARK	Yeah, I have a stomachache, but I’m good.
JOSH	I think Mark’s gonna be the most famous...
JOSH	when people see how bad he pissed his pants.
MARK	Dude, shut up.  Are you serious?
ASHLEY	Mark, you were really scared.
MARK	I would have loved to see either of you up there by yourselves.
ASHLEY	You should have seen your face.
MARK	Okay.
JOSH	What’s up with the radio?
MARK	I have to drive for two hours.
JOSH	All right, all right, all right.
MARK	And we’re done shooting.
ASHLEY	Whoa, whoa, what is that?
MARK	What?
ASHLEY	Is that a car? What is that?
MARK	What the hell is that?
JOSH	It’s just a car.
ASHLEY	No, no, no, there’s no way on earth.
MARK	Josh, cars don’t have one light. What is that? 
MARK	Is it getting closer? Turn that off.
ASHLEY	Sorry.
ASHLEY	Okay, Mark speed up. Go, go, go, go, go.
MARK	I am. Josh, is it getting closer?
ASHLEY	Yeah, it’s getting closer, I can see it.  
ASHLEY	Oh, my God.
MARK	What the hell is that?
ASHLEY	Josh, it’s not a car! Josh, it’s not a car!
MARK	 Josh, what’s it doing? What’s it doing? Is it getting closer?
ASHLEY	 Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it’s right behind us!  Mark, speed up!
MARK	I’m going as fast as I can!
JOSH	Don’t stop, dude!
MARK	 My car just died!
ASHLEY	Oh, my God. I don’t like this! I don’t like this at all!
MARK	What just happened? What just happened? The car isn’t going. 
MARK	The car isn’t going. What the hell just happened?
ASHLEY	Josh. Josh.
MARK	What the heck!
ASHLEY	Okay, stop!
MARK	Everything was fine with the car and now it’s not. 
MARK	The engine doesn’t have power. The whole car in general...
MARK	doesn’t have power.
ASHLEY	My mouth tastes weird.
JOSH	Adrenaline.
JOSH	 It’s why your mouth tastes weird.
MARK	No water. 
MARK	Yo Josh, come help me.
JOSH	Go.
MARK	Ash, put the E-brake up. 
MARK	There we go.  You ready? Let’s go.
JOSH	What the hell is going on, man?
MARK	I don’t know, man. 
MARK	All right that’s good, Ash.
JOSH	Mark?
MARK	Yeah?
JOSH	Hey man, you all right?
MARK	Yeah.
JOSH	Dude, dude your nose is bleeding.
ASHLEY	What’s going on?
ASHLEY	 What happened?
MARK	I just have a nose bleed.
ASHLEY	What?
MARK	I’m fine.
JOSH	You okay?
MARK	 Yeah, I	 
ASHLEY	Josh, just cut.
MARK	I used to get ‘em all the time when I was a kid. Stop.
JOSH	Oh, my God.
MARK	(unintelligible)
ASHLEY	You’re sweating.
MARK	I’m fine.
MARK	Is it any better?
ASHLEY	How far do you think the gas station is? Mark?
MARK	Seven, eight miles.
JOSH	In the dark?
JOSH	 We should stay with the car, we’re not doing that. That’s crazy.
MARK	Yeah we are. No, honest, it’ll take a couple hours, it’ll be open...
MARK	we’ll get some help.
ASHLEY	Let’s go.
ASHLEY	Josh?
MARK	Come on.
JOSH	Ashley, this is crazy.
JOSH	You all right?  
MARK	Huh? 
JOSH	You cool? You all right?
ASHLEY	Hey, guys.
MARK	Yeah?
ASHLEY	Come on.
ASHLEY	You guys, it’s getting cold.
JOSH	Hey, Ash? 
JOSH	Hey, Ash?  Let’s let Mark catch up.
ASHLEY	Something’s wrong with him, Josh.
JOSH	It’s just a nose bleed.
ASHLEY	No, it’s not just a nose bleed.
ASHLEY	I mean, something happened to him up there. 
ASHLEY	It’s not just a coincidence...
ASHLEY	the car dying right when the lights came back.
JOSH	So what are you saying? They’re messing with us?
ASHLEY	They’re following us.
MARK	Guys! 
MARK	Do you hear that? 
MARK	Did you hear that?
ASHLEY	Hear what?
MARK	Come here.
ASHLEY	Mark, come on.
MARK	No, someone’s out there.  
MARK	Hey!
ASHLEY	Mark!
MARK	Come here! Come help us!
ASHLEY	Dude, come on!
MARK	Come help us!
ASHLEY	What is he talking about?
MARK	Dan, I can hear you!
JOSH	Mark!
ASHLEY	Mark!
MARK	Dan! Thank God!
ASHLEY	What? 
MARK	Guys, it’s my brother!
ASHLEY	Do you hear anything?
MARK	How did you find us?
ASHLEY	What the hell is he talking about?
JOSH	Mark!
 JOSH	Come on!
ASHLEY	Mark!
JOSH	 Mark! Mark, come on!  
JOSH	Jesus!  
ASHLEY	What was that?
JOSH	I don’t know.
ASHLEY	Agh! Agh!
ASHLEY	Mark!
JOSH	Mark!
JOSH	What the hell? Mark!
ASHLEY	Hey Mark! I can’t see his headlamp.
JOSH	 Mark? Come on, man. 
JOSH	Hold on. Did you hear anything?
ASHLEY	No.
JOSH	‘Cause Mark said he heard voices.
ASHLEY	What voices, Josh? There’s no one out here. Let’s just find Mark. Hey, Mark!
JOSH	He looked so sick. Mark?
ASHLEY	How much further could he have gone?
JOSH	I don’t know.
ASHLEY	 Mark!
ASHLEY	Mark!
JOSH	Oh, God.
ASHLEY	We’re not going anywhere until we find Mark. Mark!
JOSH	Ashley.
ASHLEY	 No, we’re gonna find him.
JOSH	Ashley.
ASHLEY	 Mark!
ASHLEY	Mark!
ASHLEY	He’s gone.
JOSH	He’s not gone. He’s not gone.
JOSH	He’s just lost. He’s just lost, okay?
ASHLEY	What are you talking about? He was there and then he was gone. 
ASHLEY	Something took him. They took him.
JOSH	No. No one took him.  He’s probably behind one of these hills. Okay? 
JOSH	But we’ve gotta keep moving. 
JOSH	We’ve gotta keep moving, we’ve gotta find people...
JOSH	we can come back and help Mark, all right? 
JOSH	So come on. Come on. Please.
ASHLEY	Okay. 
ASHLEY	Okay. 
ASHLEY	I’m okay.  I’m okay.
JOSH	Listen, don’t worry about him anyway. Okay? 
JOSH	He’s been in the Boy Scouts since he was like two years old.
ASHLEY	Mark!
JOSH	Holy shit!
ASHLEY	What? What is it?
JOSH	Look! Look, it’s a light!
ASHLEY	Is it them?
JOSH	No!
JOSH	 That’s like, like a street light or a trailer or something. 
JOSH	 I told you.
ASHLEY	Okay, let’s go.
JOSH	We can get some water. Call for help.
ASHLEY	Let’s go. Yeah.
ASHLEY	Are you still filming?
JOSH	Yeah.
JOSH	I’m trying to film landmarks so we can retrace our steps.
ASHLEY	That’s smart. 
ASHLEY	I think I just need a second to rest. 
ASHLEY	We’re gonna be okay.
ASHLEY	We’re gonna find him, Josh.
JOSH	Yeah. 
ASHLEY	Shit!
JOSH	What?
ASHLEY	Damn it! I just dropped my flashlight.
JOSH	 Okay, where is it?
ASHLEY	No, there’s no way we can get it. Look down.  Shit!
JOSH	Okay, we’re gonna use this as a flashlight. 
JOSH	Okay, just flash it in front of me, all right?
ASHLEY	Okay.
JOSH	 Don’t drop it.  
ASHLEY	All right. Whoa.
JOSH	Ok, let’s go.
ASHLEY	How long does this battery last?
JOSH	About an hour.
ASHLEY	 Oh, shit.
JOSH	Is it bright enough?
ASHLEY	Yeah, it’s okay.
 JOSH	 We’re almost down.
ASHLEY	Josh?
JOSH	What?
JOSH	 God. Oh, my God.
ASHLEY	I have to do... Get... Where’s... Where’s... 
ASHLEY	 It’s in my front pocket.
JOSH	The front pocket?
JOSH	Here. Here.  
ASHLEY	Okay.
JOSH	I shouldn’t have brought you guys out here.
ASHLEY	It’s not your fault. I wanted to come.
JOSH	 Why?
ASHLEY	I don’t know. 
ASHLEY	I just wanted to do something different. Something unexpected. 
ASHLEY	Something my dad wouldn’t expect, anyway. 
ASHLEY	I’m good.
JOSH	You sure?
ASHLEY	Yeah, I’m good. I’m good. Come on.
JOSH	Shit. Ashley?
ASHLEY	Shit. 
ASHLEY	Let’s go.
JOSH	Okay.
JOSH	Oh, God.
ASHLEY	Josh?
JOSH	Hey, hey, we can’t go back.
JOSH	Come on. Just don’t look at ‘em.
JOSH	Shit.
ASHLEY	They’re burned.
ASHLEY	They burned them.
JOSH	Ashley?
ASHLEY	Josh?
JOSH	It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay.
ASHLEY	Do you hear that?
JOSH	Hear what?
ASHLEY	 Do you hear that?
JOSH	 Ashley?
JOSH	Ashley?
ASHLEY	You don’t hear that?
JOSH	Ashley?
ASHLEY	It’s my dad.
JOSH	Ashley?
ASHLEY	It’s my dad!
JOSH	Oh, my God!
