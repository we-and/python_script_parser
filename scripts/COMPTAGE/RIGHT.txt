BOB	and lady.

BOB	My name is Bob Glasser.

BOB	I've been sent from corporate, in Akron, to boost your productivity.

BOB	 Now we found the best way to do that...

BOB	 is in boosting the fun quotient of your employees.

BOB	So I'm going to tell you a joke.

SOUNDTRACK	Ah, yeah!

BOB	By the by, any joke told in the confines of this office...

BOB	must be within OSHA regulations...

BOB	and not create any discomfort, sexual or otherwise...

BOB	to the audience listening to said joke.


BOB	All right, a priest, a minister, and a rabbi walk into a brothel.

BOB	What is that?

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	That's G-Money. He works here.

BOB	Money?

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	Yeah, G-Money is his nickname.

BOB	He works here? 

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	Yes.

BOB	Well, that's unacceptable.

BOB	Just looking at this man, you can tell that...

BOB	he's breaking about eight different dress code policies.

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	 Yes, but G-Money is actually a special case.

BOB	Special? Oh, like special? 

BOB	So we get a little tax credit or something?

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	No, no, not that kind of special.

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	He is the company's top sales performer...

BOB	Is this my office?

BOB	First in overall sales.

BOB	First in ancillary sales.

BOB	Well...

BOB	This is impressive. 

GODFREY	Thank you, sir.

BOB	I just don’t understand...

BOB	how is it that you’re outperforming my...

BOB	entire sales staff by...

BOB	364%?!

GODFREY	The truth?

GODFREY	I love my job.

BOB	That's good. Very good.

GODFREY	Bob, I’ve got to ask. 

BOB	What?

GODFREY	Is that  and gosh darn if it is I'm frizzle-frazzled...

GODFREY	and pardon my French, all of it... 

GODFREY	Is that a Blues Traveler's harmonica?

BOB	You have a good eye.

GODFREY	Shut the front door!

GODFREY	Are you kidding me?

BOB	No, I'm not kidding you!

GODFREY	What? You?

BOB	Yes!

BOB	Come on, are you a fan of the Traveler?

GODFREY	Yes, I'm a Traveler fan.

BOB	Wow.

BOB	Okay, here's what happened. When the Traveler came to town...

BOB	I got backstage, BS...

BOB	After he signs this harmonica, he lets me put on his harmonica belt.

GODFREY	Okay, well, mine's not that, but 2014...

BOB	Uh-huh. 

GODFREY	Popper, Red Rocks.

BOB	Ooh.

GODFREY	A little high. You know...

BOB	Yeah.

GODFREY	You know what we do at the Traveler. 

GODFREY	What happens there, stays there.

BOB	What happens at the Traveler...

GODFREY	I'm in the audience, harmonica solo...

GODFREY	with his nose.

BOB	Shut up!

GODFREY	Nasal solo.

BOB	That's amazing.

GODFREY	Yes! 14 minutes.

BOB	What? 

GODFREY	Yeah.

BOB	We should jam sometime.

GODFREY	Oh, my God. I'd jam right now.

BOB	You play?

GODFREY	Yeah. You got some peanut butter? 

GODFREY	Because I got the jam, baby. You don't think I carry a... 

GODFREY	harmonica with me everywhere I go? 

BOB	Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?

GODFREY	Yeah! I do.

BOB	What? No!

BARTENDER	What do you want?

BARTENDER	Excuse me?

SARA	Oh. Yeah. Can I get a wine spritzer, please? 

SARA	Actually, no, make that a lemon drop martini.

KELLY	Speaking as a literary agent... 

KELLY	not everyone has to be dead at the end of a children's story. 

KELLY	I just think it's a part of life, right? 

KELLY	The sooner the better for them to learn it.

KELLY	Right. 

KELLY	Come here.

SARA	No.

KELLY	You. Them. Both.

SARA	Absolutely not! You come here.

KELLY	I'll be right back. Excuse me.

KELLY	What the fuck, Sara? 

SARA	Shh. Just check out this guy.

GODFREY	...tell you what colors are.

GODFREY	The disjunctive perpetuation of the spatial relationship...

GODFREY	brings within its realm of discourse a distinct juxtaposition.

KELLY	He's the reason people hate art.

SARA	Really? Then why'd you bring me here?

KELLY	Because you write romance novels, and you need to get laid.

GODFREY	One circle is small, down in the bottom it's big. Why?

SARA	Okay, can we talk about something other than men?

SARA	You're a lit agent. You should know about the Bechdel test.

KELLY	Okay. Shall we discuss your deadline?

SARA	No! Anything but that. 

SARA	God, I wish I could return that stupid advance. 

KELLY	First of all, I negotiated that advance for you...

KELLY	so it's not stupid, it's amazing.

KELLY	Especially considering the fact that...

KELLY	nobody reads anymore!

KELLY	Damn it, Sara. I pulled you out of your sad girl cave to inspire you. 

KELLY	Pop quiz, when was the last time you even had sex?

SARA	I don't know.

KELLY	No, wrong answer.

KELLY	The answer is 367 days ago.

SARA	What, are you tracking my sex life on an app?

KELLY	It's not an app. It's a text. 

KELLY	That’s actually a really good idea for an app.

SARA	No. I'm enjoying my celibacy, all right? 

SARA	It's me time.

KELLY	Doesn’t "me time" mean masturbating?

SARA	What? No, it definitely does not.

KELLY	Really? Well, I've been using it wrong. 

KELLY	Sara, listen, you owe Axi a book in three months.

KELLY	Three months. Okay? So just get those unmanicured fingers...

KELLY	tap, tap, tapping before you lose this contract...

KELLY	and your career is over.

KELLY	Huh? You are almost 30.

KELLY	This is my last chance to sell you as a prodigy.

SARA	I am 31.

KELLY	Don't say that out loud!

KELLY	This is a kids' world. 

KELLY	My biggest deal last year was for a seven-year-old...

KELLY	YouTube star's memoir.

KELLY	You could just die. I mean, honestly.

GODFREY	Ooh, sorry. I'm so sorry. 

GODFREY	Oh, my God, I just thought of something funny.

GODFREY	Here's what I believe.

GODFREY	The selfie has become this religious fervor...

GODFREY	and it's just become insatiable. 

GODFREY	It's not cool. It's not a selfie...

SARA	Hey, it's that guy from the other room.

GODFREY	I'm going to assume your name's Jeff.

SARA	What is he doing?

GODFREY	And what about right now?

GODFREY	What about right now? What if we just lived right now?

GODFREY	Okay, and if we can take the time and stop, and be...

GODFREY	ourselves in the moment, right, in this moment right now...

SARA	He’s so weird.

GODFREY	we are we.

GODFREY	You are you. He is he.

GODFREY	If we could live in this moment in a Buddhist like bliss...

KELLY	Come on. Come on, there's someone I want you to meet.

SARA	Okay, just don't be obvious.

KELLY	Come on.

SARA	I just... Who is this guy?

GODFREY	How about I before me, except after you?

GODFREY	I think this world would be a much better place.

GODFREY	And to be honest...
 
GODFREY	that's what this painting is about.

ARTIST	I painted it.

ARTIST	And shit, sure.

GODFREY	I know you don't smoke, but now you do.

KELLY	I don't know, he looks like Austin Powers fucked a chimney sweep.

KELLY	Come on. Come on, let's go.

SARA	Yeah.

SOUNDTRACK	Can't stop thinking about if and when I die for it...

VINCE	Hey, G, what up, what up?

GODFREY	Living. 

VINCE	I hear that.

SOUNDTRACK	...and “when” is. solemn sorrow, and one invades today 

SOUNDTRACK	While the other spies tomorrow

SOUNDTRACK	We're surrounded And we're hounded 

SOUNDTRACK	There's no "above” or "under" or "around" it

SKATEBOARDER	Hey, G.

GODFREY	Hit it. 

SOUNDTRACK	For "above" is blind belief 

SOUNDTRACK	and "under" is sword to sleeve

SOUNDTRACK	And "around" is scientific miracle,

GODFREY	Night.

SOUNDTRACK	Let's pick "above" and see

SOUNDTRACK	For if and when we go "above," the question still remains

SOUNDTRACK	Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?

SOUNDTRACK	And that's when going "under" starts to take my wonder

SOUNDTRACK	But until that time, I'll try to sing this

SOUNDTRACK	If I keep moving, they won't know

SOUNDTRACK	I'll morph to someone else

SOUNDTRACK	What they throw at me's too slow

SOUNDTRACK	I'll morph to someone else

SOUNDTRACK	I'm just a ghost

SOUNDTRACK	I'll morph to someone else

SOUNDTRACK	I'm just a ghost

SOUNDTRACK	And in the back of your mind I know 

SOUNDTRACK	You should be on with me 

SOUNDTRACK	Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

SOUNDTRACK	Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?

SOUNDTRACK	Don’t cha?

SOUNDTRACK	Don’t cha?

SOUNDTRACK	Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?

SOUNDTRACK	Don’t cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?

SOUNDTRACK	Don’t cha?

SARA	Hi!

KELLY	Sara, I am expecting to see some pages by the end of the week.

KELLY	Where is this? Okay?

KELLY	You hear me? 

SARA	Yeah. I know, I know.

SARA	I am just working here.

KELLY	Are you fake typing?
SARA	No. 

KELLY	Really? What did you just type?

SARA	Oh, what’d I type? Let’s see here.

SARA	"Stefan puts his hand on Zelna's neck."

KELLY	Zelna? I'm sorry, did you say Zelna?

SARA	Yeah, Zelna. 

SARA	Zelna Pinks-tin-ton-ton... 

SARA	is the name of my protagonist.

KELLY	Honestly Sara, this self-indulgent...

KELLY	narcissistic phase of yours... 

KELLY	This is disgusting... 

KELLY	...has gone on for too long. Your Simon breakup is messing with my money.

SARA	Simon sold his soul and became obsessed...

SARA	with his 401K and his stock options. So, no.

KELLY	Ooh! Ooh! What an asshole. 

KELLY	He grew up and did something responsible. 

KELLY	Just like every fucking woman in this world wants!

KELLY	You need to move on, so you have a date tomorrow. 

KELLY	His name is Ben. He is an artist...

KELLY	a real one, who actually makes money. 

KELLY	I've made you a reservation at that place you like...

KELLY	where all the food tastes the same.

SARA	No, no, I'm not going.

KELLY	What'd you say?

SARA	No, I'm not going.

KELLY	Oh, you're going to do it. And do you know why? 

KELLY	Because if you don't, I will expose you...

KELLY	And everyone's going to see how you live. 

KELLY	Is that something you want, people to see the squalor... 

KELLY	that is your studio apartment?

KELLY	Sweatpants strewn about?

KELLY	Moldy discarded expensive meal plan containers everywhere?

KELLY	Your pathetic vision board? 

KELLY	I will bring your mother to your apartment...

KELLY	I swear to God I will.

KELLY	And do you want her to see that?

SARA	Okay, fine, who is this guy anyway?

KELLY	Ben.

KELLY	This is disgusting. This is terrible. Get this out of my face.

KELLY	He came highly recommended.

KELLY	Makes musical steam punk instruments. 

KELLY	You know, balalaikas, accordions. 

KELLY	Where's my coffee?

KELLY	Some neo-Victorian shit.

SARA	What?

KELLY	And most importantly, he's a potential client's son, so don't be gross.

KELLY	I'm sorry. Don't be late.

SARA	Well, I don’t even know what he looks like.

KELLY	I showed him your book jacket photo, so try and resemble it.

KELLY	Thank you so much. 

KELLY	I don't know what I'd do without him.

BEN	And so after working in soul-killing jobs...

BEN	I decided to just chuck it all and do something practical.

SARA	Like designing steam punk instruments?

BEN	I love creating something with my own hands, you know...

BEN	like when you make something...

BEN	you put it out there in the world...

BEN	there's this feeling that you actually, I don’t know... 

SARA	Matter? 

BEN	Yeah.

SARA	Yeah.

BEN	So Kelly tells me you’re a writer.

SARA	Yeah.

SARA	It’s actually been kind of crazy. 

SARA	Right after college, I started this blog, Sara Syndrome.

SARA	And it was sort of like a satiric look at feminism...

SARA	and sexuality in the age of social media.

SARA	And now I write these softcore romance novels...

SARA	for dumb millennials. 

SARA	Now I'm working on my third.

BEN	Oh, wow.

BEN	Like a series or something?

BEN	Would I know it? What's it called?

SARA	The debut is called Sext.

SARA	But it came out when the word was new, so it was cool at the time.

BEN	Got it.

SARA	Actually, the whole thing was written entirely in emojis.

BEN	I can't tell if you're kidding.

SARA	Guess you'll have to read it to find out.

SARA	The critics were okay with it, but almost everyone hated the ending.

BEN	Why? What happens?

SARA	Well, the protagonist, Sara...

SARA	she flies into this passionate fit of jealous rage...

SARA	and castrates her boyfriend, Ben, with a paring knife. 

SARA	Yah! 

SARA	Gotcha!

SARA	Oh, I'm kidding. 

SARA	That was a joke.

BEN	Whew. 

SARA	Obviously, they're not called Ben and Sara. 

SARA	That would be crazy. 

SARA	But she does castrate him at the end.

BEN	I guess I'll just have to read the next one. 

BEN	What is the next one called?

SARA	Chastity.

BEN	Times have changed, huh?

SARA	No, but seriously, and don't tell Kelly this...

SARA	but I haven't actually written a single word in like two months.

SARA	Am I too young to be washed up?

BEN	Well, maybe you're abstaining from writing to learn about abstinence.

SARA	Yeah. Maybe I am doing that. 

SARA	That's what I'm doing.

GODFREY SINGING	Growing up a little dog

GODFREY SINGING	Feeling insecure 

GODFREY SINGING	Why can't we all get along

GODFREY SINGING	in this doggone world?

GODFREY SINGING	Get along little doggies 

GODFREY SINGING	Little doggies, get along 

GODFREY SINGING	Growing up a big dog 

GODFREY SINGING	in this big dog world 

GODFREY SINGING	Why can't we all get along 

GODFREY SINGING	and stop being so insecure? 

GODFREY	I'm Cowboy Cody. You guys might remember me from right now. 

GODFREY	Maybe next week too. You can maybe remember me from next week.

GODFREY	I'll be back.

GODFREY	Take care of yourselves. Drink water.

SARA	Excuse me. 

SARA	Don’t I know you from somewhere?

GODFREY	Well, you might, Ma'am. Name's Cowboy Cody.

GODFREY	Play down here all the time.

SARA	Tuesday night...

SARA	weren't you at the  Wenke Gallery in Fremont? 

GODFREY	Cowboy Cody at an art gallery? Now that's a knee-slapper.

SARA	I saw you talking like a stuck-up art critic.

SARA	And then later, you were like this stoner professor.

SARA	And now, what are you, like, some kind of southern guy?

GODFREY	Do I look like a college professor to you, Ma'am?

GODFREY	I'm just a simple cowboy.

GODFREY	I write songs. Sometimes I sing them.

GODFREY	Have a good day, Ma'am.

SARA	Wait, so you're a cowboy?

GODFREY	Yes, Ma'am.

SARA	Is this some kind of reality show or...?

GODFREY	Ma'am, I truly think you have me mistaken for somebody else. 

GODFREY	Have a nice day now.

SARA	No, no, it was you. You're hard to miss in a crowd.

SARA	Come on, let me buy you a coffee or something.

GODFREY	Bless your heart. But I got to skedaddle out of here...

GODFREY	and giddy on up onto my pony.

SARA	You need to learn some better cowboy words.

SARA	Come on, I'm really curious.

GODFREY	All right, well, if you're itching to see me...

GODFREY	I'm going to be in Fremont Wednesday at 8:00.

SARA	Who the hell are you?

GODFREY	I'm Cowboy Cody.

SARA	Hello.

BEN	Hi, it's Ben. How are you?

SARA	Good, you know? Just doing my thing, you know...

SARA	getting some productive writing done.

SARA	How about you? How's the flugelhorn coming?

SARA	Are you blowing it? 

SARA	That was an attempt at flugelhorn humor.

SARA	Please say something else.

BEN	Oh, I was wondering if you wanted to go out...

BEN	Friday night with some friends of mine.

SARA	Ooh. What were your friends thinking?

BEN	I'm not really sure yet. Just maybe some drinks or... 

BEN	maybe a show?

SARA	You know what? Maybe we could start off at Venue.

SARA	Some performers are doing something there.

BEN	I love performers doing something...

BEN	so sure. 

SARA	Great. So, I'll see you then.

SARA	What am I watching?

BEN	I think it's a satirical piece on the entanglements...

BEN	created by the modern social construct.

VAN	I like the body positive aspect to the work. 

VAN	It's so much a part of what's missing in post-modern art.

SARA	Bet by the end they give birth to a sweater.

VAN	That's impossible. Sweaters aren't humans.

BEN	Chloe here is a musician.

SARA	Yeah? What do you play?

VAN	Chloe isn't talking right now.

SARA	Oh. Why?

VAN	She's practicing meditative silence for 24 hours.

SARA	Cool.

EMCEE #1	Give it up for Yarna Sutra, everybody.

BEN	Excellent! Excellent!

EMCEE #1	Don’t let my cat near those guys.

EMCEE #1	Up next, let’s have a big round of applause... 

EMCEE #1	for Allie Cornbush!

GODFREY	My name's Allie Cornbush.

GODFREY	I'm from Iowa City, Iowa.

GODFREY	Go, Hawkeyes!

GODFREY	I just got in town yesterday...

GODFREY	and I got off the Greyhound, and there were two...

GODFREY	of the nicest fellas waiting for me.

GODFREY	One of them offered to help me with my luggage...

GODFREY	and the other one offered to get married.

SARA	Ooh! 

GODFREY	Tomorrow. I'm going to put it off until tomorrow. 

GODFREY	We're going to do it tomorrow.

SARA	Oh, my God.

GODFREY	The reason that I came down here is because of my grandma. 

GODFREY	God bless her soul.

SARA	Aw...

GODFREY	So tonight, I'd like to perform for you a song that I wrote. 

GODFREY	It's called "How To Be Alone."

GODFREY	It's for anyone that's ever felt lost.

GODFREY SINGING	Wish I knew how to be alone 

GODFREY SINGING	Wish I knew how to do it 

GODFREY SINGING	Wish I knew how to be in the room by myself without 

GODFREY SINGING	Thinking about you and

GODFREY SINGING	the times that we had

GODFREY SINGING	The people we saw 

GODFREY SINGING	The places we saw together 

GODFREY SINGING	Wish I knew how to be alone by myself 

GODFREY SINGING	I just don't know how to do it 

GODFREY SINGING	Wish I knew how to build a boat 

GODFREY SINGING	I wish I knew how to do it 

GODFREY SINGING	Guess I could grab a book off a shelf 

GODFREY SINGING	and start riffling through it

GODFREY SINGING	But, oh, I forgot 

GODFREY SINGING	I don't know how to sail 

GODFREY SINGING	I don't have a sea leg to do it

GODFREY SINGING	I guess I'm landlocked 

GODFREY SINGING	with a boat in my driveway

GODFREY SINGING	Oops 

GODFREY SINGING	Because

GODFREY SINGING	I blew it 

GODFREY	Thank you guys so much. I'm Allie Cornbush.

EMCEE #1	Give it up for Allie Cornbush!

SARA	Yo, Allie Cornbush!

GODFREY	Hey, darling. How are you? 

SARA	That was amazing.

SARA	I mean, surprising, but amazing.

GODFREY	Thank you so much. You're so sweet. 

SARA	Oh, this is Ben and Ben's friends.

BEN	That was an interesting performance.

GODFREY	Thank you so much.

GODFREY	You know, sometimes the Lord and the Holy Spirit...

GODFREY	just come down into me, and I don't know what I’m gonna do... 

GODFREY	Ooh, ooh, ooh!

GODFREY	Ooh, ooh!

SARA	You’ve got to join us.

GODFREY	I wish I could, but I've got to go. 

GODFREY	Nice meeting, y'all. Toodle-loo!

SARA	Wait, where are you going?

GODFREY	What do you mean? I got places to go and people to see.

SARA	Well, can I come?

GODFREY	How about a raincheck?

SARA	Well, we could, but I'm free now. 

SARA	I mean, I am kind of on a date, but...

SARA	Yeah, he seems happy with the farmer and his girlfriend, so how about it?


SARA	Look, truthfully, I don't really find people...

SARA	that interesting or worth getting to know. 

SARA	But I'm obviously very intrigued by you, so...


GODFREY	All right. You're persistent.

GODFREY	Ballard Avenue, Montlake Boulevard at midnight.

SARA	Midnight?

SARA	Name's Sara, by the way, in case you wanted to know.

GODFREY	Toodle-loo!

SARA	Okay.

SARA	Oh, hey.

GODFREY	Let’s go.

SARA	Oh. Okay.

SARA	What is this?

SARA	No, seriously. 

SARA	Okay, wait for me. Wait for me, wait for me.

SARA	Did you hear that? 

SARA	Is anybody there? 

SARA	No? Okay. 

SARA	Wait, what? 

SARA	Where did you go? 

SARA	Hello?! 

SARA	Hello?!

SARA	Hello?!

SARA	Oh, my God! 

SARA	You are in the middle of nowhere...

SARA	at 1:00 in the morning with some guy whose name you don't even know. 

SARA	And now you're in the middle of a horror movie. 

SARA	Not you're best idea, Sara. Not your best idea.

GODFREY	Hello! It's me. 

GODFREY	DJ Katamine.

SARA	Okay...

SARA	First of all, do not scare me! 

SARA	And secondly, why are you wearing that?

GODFREY	Put it on. Let's find out.

SARA	Wait, seriously?

GODFREY	Put it on.

GEKE	Well, if it ain't the OG! 

GEKE	What's good, man?

GEKE	Hey, yo, we can't wait to see you spin tonight.

SARA	Wait, you're a DJ?

GODFREY	Something like that.

SARA	Doesn't Deadmaus have this whole angle covered?

GEKE	Yeah, where do you think he got the idea from?

SARA	What?

GEKE	Hey, man, what's with the chick?

GODFREY	She's all right.

SARA	I'm all right.

SHAD	What are you, a DJ wannabe?

SARA	Yeah, that's right. I'm a DJ wannabe.

SHAD	Man, I ain't working with no toy.

GEKE	Toy?

GEKE	How long you been in the game for?

GEKE	You're still just hitting play on Spotify.

GEKE	Is she in the decks?

GODFREY	No, I got something else planned for her.

SARA	You do?

SHAD	Just keep the toy away from me.

GEKE	You're the boss.

GEKE	What's up, you sexy mo-fos!

GEKE	All right, our headliner’s coming to the stage.

GEKE	Give it up for the one...

GEKE	the only, DJ Katamine!

GODFREY	Yo, yo, yo! What's up?

GODFREY	Make some noise!

GODFREY	Let's give it up for the hottest feline hype person in town!

GODFREY	Give it up for DJ Meow-na Lisa!

SARA	Hell no. I don't perform. I'm not a performer.

GODFREY	Come on, grab it. You're wearing a mask.

GODFREY	You can be anybody you want to be, just take it.

SARA	You go out there, not me.

GODFREY	Look, I brought you here for a reason. I got a feeling about you.

SARA	Who’s ready to lap up some milk?!

SARA	Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

SARA	That was... 

SARA	That was so much fun! Oh, my God!

SARA	You got me to perform in front of people, and I actually liked it.

GEKE	Yo, yo, yo. I’m out, G.

GODFREY	That was fun.

GEKE	Meow-na!

SARA	All right, fine. I’ll give you my number. 

SARA	206-855-3152!

SARA	All right, text me!

MR. DIXON	I think you sound like a fine young man. 

MR. DIXON	What'd you say your name was?

GODFREY	The name's George, sir.

MR. DIXON	Now don't tell me you're from Alabama yourself.

GODFREY	Yep! Born in the great city of Selma, sir. 

MR. DIXON	Well, heck, I knew I liked you.

GODFREY	I love the films of Shammi Kapoor, too.

INDIAN WOMAN	Oh, he was wonderful.

GODFREY	If you ever saw me, you'd say that I look just like Shammi. 

GODFREY	Especially the way he looked in Mama Bhanja.

GODFREY	So you're a private investigator? 

GODFREY	I was actually looking into hiring a private investigator. 

GODFREY	Yeah, I just want to see what I'm up to.

GODFREY	I found that when I'm in Ardha Chandrasana...

GODFREY	I channel more shiva energy if I wrap my standing leg around my head.

GODFREY	Do you hear that?

GODFREY	I'm just saying that “stop, drop, and roll...”

GODFREY	You got to add another “stop” to that.

GODFREY	There's no such thing as scented Wi-Fi. No, there's not.

GODFREY	Yeah, hi, just one piece of pizza delivered. 

GODFREY	You guys just deliver pieces?

GODFREY	Your total is $321. 

GODFREY	No. 

GODFREY	No. 

GODFREY	You.

GODFREY	You Namaste.

SARA	What? 

SARA	All right. 

SARA	Hello?

KELLY	You left your date in the middle of a club last night. 

KELLY	You humiliated him.

KELLY	Yeah.

SARA	It wasn't really going well.

KELLY	Okay, so you say you’ve got to walk your dog...

KELLY	or you have explosive diarrhea or something. 

KELLY	You don't just leave like an animal.

KELLY	Plus, his mom, I was on the brink of signing her.

KELLY	And she has more number one bestsellers...

KELLY	than all of my clients combined. That includes you.

KELLY	All you had to do was be normal, but you couldn't, could you? No.

KELLY	But once again, it was all about you...

KELLY	with no thought of how it was going to affect me.

KELLY	I'm sorry, I was wearing a cat head at a rave.

KELLY	Be honest with me.

KELLY	Are you on drugs?

SARA	Please, I wish I was on drugs.

SARA	I'm too paranoid to be on drugs.No, look, I'm sorry, I just...

SARA	I bumped into the most interesting person last night.

KELLY	Please don't tell me you found another lost soul to save.

KELLY	Rub them!

SARA	I did not find another lost soul to save.

KELLY	It was that eccentricguy from the gallery.

SARA	I think this guy can really inspire a good book.

KELLY	What? No. No. No book. 

KELLY	Axi wants Chastity. That is what they paid for.
 
SARA	I think I can make Chastity about identity...

SARA	and how we're all trying to be something we're not.

KELLY	I'm already writing it.

KELLY	It’s a book to diddle to! What are you talking about? 

KELLY	What? No, stop.

KELLY	Chastity is a book about a girl trying to track down her kidnapped dog...

KELLY	and hopefully banging a bunch of hot dudes along the way. This isn't Tolstoy. 

KELLY	What's this guy's name anyway?

SARA	You know what? I don't know.

KELLY	Okay, so you're going to write a boring novel...

KELLY	about a nameless guy you just met? Is that the plan?

SARA	He's not one person. He's, like, many different people.

KELLY	He's a mystery, and I need to unravel him.

KELLY	Oh, honey, no.

KELLY	Sara, the streets of Seattle are littered with guys like this. 

KELLY	You're mistaking crazy for interesting.

SARA	No, he's not crazy. He's a complete original.

SARA	Like one day, he's this pretentious stuck-up art critic...

SARA	and on the next, he's a female singer.

SARA	And then the day after that, he's like a rave DJ.

KELLY	Okay, so fully schizophrenic, because that's exactly what you just described.

KELLY	Please tell me you're not sleeping with him.

KELLY	No! I do feel happy around him, though, and inspired.

KELLY	Still, you should get tested anyway.

SARA	This is not about dating, and it's not about me.

SARA	It's about the book, I promise.

KELLY	And you know how long I've been stuck.

SARA	And last night, the dam broke...
 
SARA	and I couldn't stop writing.

KELLY	And it's the best stuff I've ever written. 

SARA	You know what? I am going to be late for my guitar lesson. 

SARA	I got to go.

KELLY	You're taking guitar lessons?

SARA	Yeah, I got to fill up my creative gas tank.

KELLY	No, Sara, guitaring is not writing.

KELLY	Hello! Hello! 

KELLY	Damn it!

KELLY	It's like you're my only friend.

MYRA	Well, it’s about time you came to visit. 

MYRA	Well?

MYRA	That’s not enough. 

MYRA	That’s not enough! 

MYRA	After all we’ve done for you and those kids, this is all we get?

MYRA	Well, why don’t you go back to your fancy apartment...

MYRA	and get us some more money?

SARA	Excuse me. 

SARA	Oh, hey, you're from last night.

SHAD	What do you want with him?

SARA	What do you mean, what do I want?

SHAD	I mean, why are you hanging with him?

SARA	What? Who are you? I don't even know you. 

SARA	How the hell do you know where I live?

SHAD	I followed you home last night.

SARA	Okay, wow.

SARA	If you stalk me, I will call the cops. Jeez!

SHAD	Just leave Godfrey alone.

SARA	Oh, that's his name? Godfrey?

SHAD	Yeah, Godfrey doesn't have no friends.

SARA	Oh yeah? Then who the hell are you?

SHAD	I'm his brother.

SARA	Wait, you're his brother?

SHAD	Yeah, so I know everything that goes on in his life.

SHAD	Trust me, you ain't going to be a part of it.

SARA	Oh, well, are you his brother or his father?

SARA	Because whoever he is, he's a grown-ass man.

SARA	He doesn't have to answer to you. And neither do I.

SHAD	Yo, leave him alone!

SHAD	He doesn't need you screwing up his life!

MAGICIAN PUPPET	You're no good. The kids won't like you.

GODFREY	Yes, they will, you stupid. 

GODFREY	You stay down, and you just be a stupid puppet.

MAGICIAN PUPPET	Okay. Sorry, Boss.

MRS. MILLER	Our favorite volunteer, Mr. G, is back with us today.

MRS. MILLER	Isn't that great?

LION PUPPET	Hello, kids! I think it's time for me to get a haircut.

MAGICIAN PUPPET	Oh, did I hear a haircut?

MAGICIAN PUPPET	I'm a magician. I can do it without scissors.

MAGICIAN PUPPET	Okay, now watch carefully.

MAGICIAN PUPPET	Abracadabra. Alakazam!

MAGICIAN PUPPET	What do you think of your new look?

LION PUPPET	Give me my hair back or I will eat you!

MAGICIAN PUPPET	Okay, okay, don't eat me, Lion.

MAGICIAN PUPPET	Okay, children, do you remember the magic words?

CHILDREN	Abracadabra! Alakazam!

MAGICIAN PUPPET	Ooh, I can't see my hat.I cannot see the top of my head!

MAGICIAN PUPPET	Thank you. Thank you.

SIMON	Sara?

SARA	Oh, my God. Nope, nope, nope, nope.

SARA	No, no, nope.

SIMON	Sara?

SARA	Simon!

SARA	Hi!

SIMON	Is that your bike?

SARA	This bike? 

SARA	No. No. No.

SIMON	Come here, bring in it.

SARA	Okay!

SARA	Hi. Oh, we’re hugging.

SIMON	Oh, okay.

SARA	Yep. Good to see you.

SARA	How are you?

SIMON	Good. Good.

SIMON	God, it’s been a minute. What are you doing?

SARA	I am taking guitar lessons.

SARA	See? I have a guitar.

SIMON	Hey. Your hair, it’s longer.

SARA	It is! Thank you for noticing. It grew, so...

SARA	Every day, it grows.

SIMON	Yeah.

SARA	And, yeah. How are the suburbs? 

SIMON	Not as bad as you think. There’s actually some cool people in the boonies.

SARA	Oh great! I'm sure.

SARA	That’s so wonderful.

SARA	Nice Dockers, by the way.

SIMON	Oh, how dare you?

SIMON	These are Banana Republic.

SIMON	This is my wife, Allegra.

SARA	Allegra! Hi!

ALLEGRA	Hi!

SARA	Look at that! Congratulations to you. 

ALLEGRA	Oh, thank you.

ALLEGRA	Yeah, okay. I’m just going to say it. 

ALLEGRA	Simon told me all about you... 

ALLEGRA	and I love your book...

SARA	Oh!

ALLEGRA	Sext.

SARA	What?

ALLEGRA	Yeah, I mean, I know I’m not exactly the target audience, but...

ALLEGRA	there are some serious feminist undertones in there...

ALLEGRA	and it reminded me of, like, Louisa May Alcott.

SARA	Thank you.

SARA	That is so nice. Thank you.

SIMON	Well, Allegra’s a writer too.

SARA	What?

ALLEGRA	Oh, my God, but nowhere near as good as what you do.

ALLEGRA	I mean, I just write biographies. I don’t invent things.

SIMON	Yeah, but you were just nominated for a PEN.

ALLEGRA	Well, I'm not going to win, so we don't have to talk about that.

SARA	PEN?!

SIMON	Don’t say that. Everyone’s freaking out for it!

SIMON	Look, she just wrote Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's bio.

SARA	What?!

SIMON	Amazing.

ALLEGRA	Guilty.

SARA	Guilty?

ALLEGRA	Are you okay?

SARA	Yeah. 

SARA	So when are you due?

ALLEGRA	Two weeks to go.

ALLEGRA	I don’t know how I could get any bigger. 

SARA	You’re huge, by the way. 

ALLEGRA	I know! 

ALLEGRA	I’m like a beluga!

ALLEGRA	Yeah, but, I mean, Simon’s been so attentive.

SARA	Aw, look at that!

SARA	That's so great. Really, that’s so amazing.

SARA	I didn’t know you wanted kids! So, that’s news.

SARA	What ever happened to... 

SARA	"I can't in good conscience bring a child into this world?"

SARA	What happened to that guy?

SIMON	Water. 

SARA	Where is he?

ALLEGRA	Oh, I mean, it just happened so fast.

ALLEGRA	I mean, we were dating for like, what, four months? Babe?

SIMON	Five?

SARA	That’s fast!

ALLEGRA	I think it was four months, then we got married.

SARA	Wow!

ALLEGRA	And then, I mean, this just happened. 

ALLEGRA	And, I mean, I don’t even know this guy. 

SARA	Me, either! 

SIMON	Honey, we don’t want to be late.

ALLEGRA	Oh! No, we don’t.

ALLEGRA	We’re taking maternity photos.

SARA	Okay.

SIMON	Well, it was really great seeing you.

SARA	Okay. Yeah, really good to see you.

ALLEGRA	Yeah.

ALLEGRA	Great meeting you.

SARA	To meet you.

SARA	See you, and thank you. Okay. Yep. 

SIMON	All right. Okay.

SARA	Yep. Yep.

ALLEGRA	Okay, bye.

SARA	Okay.

ALLEGRA	I love her.

SIMON	I do want kids.

ALLEGRA	Oh. You know what?

ALLEGRA	We’ll talk about it in the car.

SIMON	Okay, but I

ALLEGRA	We’ll talk about it in the car.

SIMON	Okay.

SARA	Speak.

GODFREY	Hello, is this Sara?

SARA	Who is this?

GODFREY	It is Mateo.

GODFREY	My good friend DJ Katamine suggested I call you.

SARA	Oh! DJ Katamine. Right. 

SARA	Hi... Mateo. Buenos noches.

GODFREY	Como estas?

SARA	No, I don't actually speak Spanish.

GODFREY	So, it was suggested by my friend...

GODFREY	that you might want to try some ballroom dancing.

SARA	Really? Well, did your friend happen to mention...

SARA	that I haven’t ballroom danced in...

SARA	I don’t know, like, never? 

GODFREY	It’s okay. He told me you have the body of a dancer...

GODFREY	and the finesse of a mongoose.

SARA	Oh, well, that's very... 

SARA	flattering?

GODFREY	Then I will pick you up tonight at sbet w thlathwn.

SARA	What?

GODFREY	That’s Arabic for 7:30.

SARA	Oh, right.

SARA	Mateo, I will see you then. 

SARA	Oh, wait. You don’t actually know where I...

SARA	live.

SARA	Mateo, I don't have any experience with this kind of dancing. 

SARA	I don't think anyone has in 60 years.

GODFREY	Follow me...

GODFREY	and I will lead you to the path of beauty. 

SARA	Oh, okay.

SARA	How'd you learn to dance like this?

GODFREY	It is in my blood.

SARA	Right.

SARA	And where exactly are you from?

GODFREY	I am from everywhere.

GODFREY	I was a young boy, I was a goat herder in Argentina...

GODFREY	and I dream of dancing the waltz after I saw The Sound of Music.

SARA	I love that movie. 

GODFREY	Me too.

GODFREY	And so I searched the country for Maria, and I can't find her.

GODFREY	And so I ended up dancing with my goat, Sophia.

SARA	Okay.

GODFREY	Yeah.

SARA	So you learned to dance with your goat. 

SARA	That sounds normal, right?

GODFREY	Very popular.

GODFREY	Wunderbar!

SARA	What is that, German?

GODFREY	Si. Oui, oui.

GODFREY	Follow me.

SARA	Okay.

GODFREY	Magnifique.

SARA	Thanks.

SARA	Hey. 

SARA	So last night wasn’t a dream.

GODFREY	You are welcome.

SARA	I just realized I haven't had a guy in my apartment in, like, a year.

SARA	So thank you for being such a gentlemen.

GODFREY	It is who I am.

SARA	You know, yesterday I ran into my ex...

SARA	and he was with his wife. And she was pregnant.

SARA	I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm telling you this.

GODFREY	Oh no, well...

SARA	I guess it just kind of upset me, because...

SARA	it made me sad that he's not living his truth.

SARA	But there's nothing I can do about that.

GODFREY	Si.

SARA	I'm so glad you called because I feel like our night...

SARA	together reminded me of who I really am.

SARA	I’m sorry. Blah, blah, blah.

SARA	Why don't you tell me something about you?

GODFREY	Well... 

GODFREY	I am but a poor, young goat herder

SARA	From Argentina. Yeah, I know.

GODFREY	Argentina.

SARA	But see, I just spilled my guts... 

SARA	so maybe you can tell me something honest, something true.

GODFREY	Okay. Well...

GODFREY	I come to the US... 

GODFREY	I'm a stowaway. 

SARA	Wait, is this a real story? Because I know you’re not really from Argentina.

GODFREY	I am.

SARA	Because I just assumed last night we were messing around, so what’s...

SARA	What’s your deal?

GODFREY	I first move here to Miami, I have no job.

GODFREY	And so I start as a dishwasher, and...

GODFREY	I do some things I am not proud of.

SARA	I’m not judging, so...

GODFREY	Okay, so my friend, Manny...

GODFREY	he tells me about a job we can do for money, you know? 

GODFREY	We sell ze yayo. Ze cocaine.

GODFREY	And we get a job.

GODFREY	We go down to South Beach, we have a kilo, and this man and wife...

GODFREY	they take the kilo, they don't give us money, and they take Manny.

GODFREY	And they beat him. And they put him in the shower and they chain him up...

GODFREY	and they get a chainsaw. 

GODFREY	And they’re going to kill him. And I say, no! 

SARA	Wait. Are you fucking with me? What is this?

GODFREY	No, I’m not fucking.

SARA	That’s the plot of Scarface, dude.

GODFREY	I haven’t...never seen such movies.

SARA	No. No. Seriously?

SARA	What is this?What’s happening right now? 

SARA	Are you pranking me?

GODFREY	No! I am telling you a story.

SARA	No, you’re not. You’re not telling a story. 

SARA	You’re making a joke about everything, and I’m believing you.

SARA	God, I don’t know what this is. 

SARA	I don’t know what happened last night. 

SARA	Maybe it’s because I actually like you. 

SARA	Maybe it’s because I saw my ex, but either way...

SARA	I spent the night with you, okay?

SARA	And I’m dressed, but I feel completely naked right now. 

SARA	I need to know who I’m with.

SARA	Nothing?

SARA	Okay, so now I have to ask you to leave.

SARA	I want you to leave.

SARA	You have to go!

SARA	Now!

SARA	Who are you?

GODFREY	Nobody.

KELLY	So I'm downstairs, and I hear this noise.

KELLY	I push open the bathroom door, and there's Dan.

KELLY	And he is standing there wiping off makeup.

KELLY	Makeup! It was my makeup!

KELLY	And I get it, it's modern times right now...

KELLY	and we’re all supposed to be gender fluid or whatever. 

KELLY	But you would think after eight years of marriage...

KELLY	my husband would tell me if he was thinking of...

KELLY	crossdressing or whatever.

SARA	Maybe.

KELLY	Yeah. I guess it doesn’t matter. 

KELLY	It would have been nice if you listen to my story...

KELLY	about my husband using all of my foundation.

SARA	I slept with him.

KELLY	Who, Dan?

SARA	No, with the guy.

KELLY	Nutty? You slept with Nutty?

SARA	I slept with him.

KELLY	Oh, God! 

SARA	I didn’t sleep with him. We just cuddled all night, but...

SARA	and don’t call him Nutty. His name’s Godfrey...

SARA	or Mateo, or, like, whatever.

KELLY	His name is Godfrey?

SARA	Yeah. 

KELLY	Some parent named their kid Godfrey, and then you slept with that guy. 

KELLY	You slept with a Godfrey.

SARA	I was feeling vulnerable.

SARA	And he was charming. He was very charming. 

SARA	He took us out dancing. We danced. 

SARA	Like, we really danced. And then next thing you know...

SARA	we're just, like, spooning in my bed.

KELLY	Is that fun?

SARA	It might have something to do with the fact that I bumped into Simon earlier.

KELLY	What? Oh, dear.

SARA	He’s married. And his PEN Award-nominated wife is pregnant.

KELLY	Shit. I hate it when men upgrade. No offense.

KELLY	Do you think she needs an agent? 

KELLY	I’m kidding! I’m kidding. 

KELLY	Come here. Look, it’s okay. I’m here. 

KELLY	Did you get any good material from this?

SARA	Are you serious?

KELLY	I’m just...

KELLY	Hey! Hey, you! Yeah, you!

STORE EMPLOYEE	You’re the crazy lady.

KELLY	Yeah, you know what?

KELLY	I am crazed. Fucking crazed for some Fromage Madeleine...

KELLY	which you don’t have for the third week in a row, by the way. 

KELLY	Who do I have to blow to get some decent cheese around here?

KELLY	Is it you? Is that what you want?You want me to embarrass you... 

KELLY	in front of all your clerk friends?

STORE EMPLOYEE	No. No.

STORE EMPLOYEE	I will go check with my manager.

KELLY	Yeah. Do that, because this threat extends to him, too! 

KELLY	It’s fine.

SARA	I’m just...

SARA	I’m so confused. Like, who have I been hanging out with this whole time?

SARA	Why is he doing this?

KELLY	He’s crazy, so just stay away.

SARA	He’s not crazy. He’s choosing his personalities. 

SARA	Trust me. I did some Googling. 

KELLY	Oh, boy. Sara?

SARA	What?

KELLY	I was wrong. Okay?

SARA	Whoa.

KELLY	I was wrong... I said it...to ask you to come out of your shell.

KELLY	All right? So just stuff yourself back in there and finish your book...

KELLY	because so far, the material is pretty good...

KELLY	and all you need is some distance and objectivity, right? 

KELLY	Do not shit where you eat.

SARA	Okay.

KELLY	You don’t think I have plenty of clients that I would love to bang...

KELLY	but I don’t, and you know why?

KELLY	Commission. 

KELLY	You thought I was going to say morals.

SARA	I did.

KELLY	It’s commission.

MRS. MILLER	Class, guess who’s back!

MRS. MILLER	It’s our volunteer, Mr. G! 

MRS. MILLER AND CHILDREN	Yay!

GODFREY	Whoa! 

GODFREY	You guys look so much older. 

GODFREY	How are you?

GODFREY	Are you good? Good. 

GODFREY	You guys want to read a book?

CHILDREN	Yeah!

GODFREY	Yeah?

BOY #1	You will read the book.

GODFREY	You know what? I’ll read a book for you. 

GODFREY	“How to Be A Friend.” That sounds like a good book, doesn’t it?

CHILDREN	Yeah!

GODFREY	Yeah.

GODFREY READING	“There are times when it feels good to be by yourself. 

GODFREY READING	And enjoying your own company. 

GODFREY READING	But there are also times when you may feel lonely or bored...


GODFREY READING	when you want to have someone to play with. 

GODFREY READING	Anyone who is nice to you...

GODFREY READING	and who likes to play with you...

GODFREY READING	can become your friend.

GODFREY READING	The best thing about having a friend is...

GODFREY READING	sharing."

GIRL #1	Do you need to go to the potty, Mr. G?

GODFREY	I’m fine. I’m fine. Thank you. 

GODFREY READING	“We want somebody to share with. 

GODFREY READING	Mr. Frog wants to share.” 

GODFREY	Who wants to share with Mr. Frog?

SINGER SINGING	You got a lover's rock and roll 

SINGER SINGING	The next day, a man he lived next door

SINGER SINGING	He kept me up all night made trouble, boy 

SINGER SINGING	Trouble

SHAD	Hey, what up?

SARA	What, are you stalking me again?

SHAD	Hell, no. This is my office.

SARA	Your office?

SHAD	Yeah.

SARA	What is that, weed? I thought weed was legal.

SHAD	People still like the drama of buying it on the street.

SARA	 Okay, what do you want?

SHAD	He's sorry.

SARA	Oh, you talked to him.

SHAD	Look, I don't know what he did, but he feels bad about it.

SARA	All right, sit down. Let's talk.

SARA	Here. Take that. You can have it.

SHAD	What the hell is this?

SARA	It’s tofu.

SHAD	Tofu?

SARA	Yeah.

SHAD	I thought it was turkey. 

SHAD	You don’t just hand someone a tofu sandwich and not say anything. 

SHAD	What’s wrong with you?

SARA	I’m sorry, man. Jeez.

SARA	So what’s up with your brother?

SHAD	It’s complicated.

SARA	Yeah, no shit.

SARA	I mean, is he ever himself? 

SARA	Have I actually even met the guy?

SHAD	Yeah, but...
 
SHAD	it’s all versions of him.You know what I mean?

SARA	No, I don’t.

SHAD	Well, all the “hims,” they’re still him...

SHAD	but he doesn’t want to be completely himself.

SHAD	You don’t want to know.

SARA	I do want to know.

SARA	I care about your brother.

SARA	I know I don’t know him, clearly...

SARA	but I feel like...

SARA	inside, there’s a special, sweet person.

SHAD	Man, the only reason I’m telling you this is because Godfrey likes you, okay...

SHAD	and because you need to understand where he’s coming from.

SHAD	Godfrey's parents were worthless.

SHAD	Okay, they took in foster kids to make money.

SHAD	When we were growing up, Godfrey was...

SHAD	more than a brother to me and my sister, Didi.

SHAD	He was like our dad.

SHAD	He took care of us. 

SHAD	Cooked, cleaned, made us go to school. 

SHAD	My sister...
 
SHAD	she wasn’t but five years old at the time...

SHAD	and one day while Godfrey was getting me ready for school...

SHAD	Di was playing by the window in the living room. 

SHAD	And my fosters was in there, but they was drunk...

GODFREY READING	passed out or some shit. 

SHAD	Next thing you know...

SHAD	she fell out. 

SHAD	And we ran downstairs, and...

SHAD	Godfrey took her in his arms, but...

SHAD	she was gone.

SARA	Oh, my God.

SHAD	My fosters blamed it all on Godfrey.

SARA	Oh, come on. That’s not fair.

SHAD	It doesn’t matter. 

SHAD	Since then, he’s just been blocking out the world.

SHAD	That’s why he does them characters.He don’t like being himself.

SHAD	He can’t deal with the guilt.

SHAD	I haven’t really seen the real Godfrey since she died.

SARA	I’m so sorry. 

SARA	Is he getting any help?

SHAD	He’s working and making a living and functioning... 

SHAD	so that’s all I care about.

SARA	What can I do?

SHAD	Well, best thing you could’ve done was leave him be...

SHAD	but now that you messed that up, just...

SHAD	I don’t know, be a good friend to him.

SARA	I mean, I would like to, but I can’t even get ahold of him.

SHAD	He's going to be at this tonight.

SARA	What is this? Like stand-up comedy?

SHAD	No clue. He’s always doing something to keep his mind...

SHAD	focused on anything but himself.

SARA	Does he even enjoy it?

SHAD	He kind of relaxes around kids. That’s the only time he feels really calm.

SARA	Where are you going?

SHAD	I’ve got to pick up a new mixer.

SHAD	I’m just short on a little paper right now.

SARA	Oh. Well, do you want some money?

SARA	I have some.

SHAD	Hey, don’t try to buy me off.

SHAD	You just be you.
SARA	Just be me. Okay.

FEMALE POET	I am ready on my own.

EMCEE #2	Coming up next we have a guy that says he's going to do something.

EMCEE #2	Please welcome to the stage, for the very first time, Tim Dimmitt.

GODFREY	Thanks.

GODFREY	I wrote...

GODFREY	I wrote something.

GODFREY READING	“She...”
 
GODFREY READING	“She flutters through the house...

GODFREY READING	a splash of sunshine...

GODFREY READING	sprinkling her magic in the air with laughter. 

GODFREY READING	Each syllable of sound echoes in my soul.

GODFREY READING	But as I walk in a space of a world left behind...

GODFREY READING	I see the ghost of her...

GODFREY READING	and I search and search, but all in vain... 

GODFREY READING	I hear a...

GODFREY READING	an echo of nothing.

GODFREY READING	So upon these streets I...”

GODFREY	I’m sorry. 

GODFREY READING	“So upon these streets I walk alone.

GODFREY READING	But now a new sound fills the air. 

GODFREY READIING	The laughter of a woman who has walked beside me.

GODFREY READING	She's helped fill the void through music...

GODFREY READING	through her words... 

GODFREY READING	art, rhyme...

GODFREY READING	and eases the pain of the simple sound... 

GODFREY READING	of a child who's long gone.”

SARA	So, Tim Dimmitt. 

SARA	You always wear your sunglasses at night?

GODFREY	My eyes are sensitive to light.

SARA	Oh.

GODFREY	So I use my other senses, like my hands...

GODFREY	nose, and ears in low-light situations.

GODFREY	I can tell that you're wearing a moisturizer...

GODFREY	that has a strong scent of gardenia...

GODFREY	a hint of jasmine, and a refined honeysuckle finish.

SARA	That's amazing.

GODFREY	Heard that. Thank you.

SARA	I can tell you're a very sensitive man.

SARA	The poem you recited was very moving. 

SARA	It must have taken a lot of courage to say it out loud like that. 

GODFREY	I’m just trying to sort things out. The world is a messy place.

SARA	Hey, how are you doing?

GODFREY	I'm all right. Just killing time.

SARA	Before we met... 

SARA	I was kind of in a funk. 

SARA	I was depressed, to be honest.

SARA	I couldn't access y creativity, and then...

SARA	I met you, and that all went away. So... 

SARA	I guess that's the opposite of killing time.

SARA	Hey, why don't you tell me something about the girl in the poem?

GODFREY	I don't like talking about it. 

GODFREY	It's too hard.

SARA	I understand. It is hard.

SARA	It's hard to talk about the most painful things in our lives... 

SARA	but sometimes...

SARA	when we look inside and deal with those most painful things...

SARA	it can turn into something really beautiful. 

SARA	So, if you want to talk about her... 

SARA	I'm here.

GODFREY	It's been a long time since I let someone in.

GODFREY	Her name was Didi. 

GODFREY	She had a beautiful soul.

GODFREY	She loved country music...

GODFREY	so I'd sing "Achy-Breaky Heart" to her every morning...

SARA	Oh, my God! Oh!

SARA	I’m so sorry. I am so sorry. Oh...

SARA	Ew. Oh. It’s soaked. 

SARA	Oh, my God. Yeah, can I get a napkin, please?

WAITER	Yeah.

SARA	Oh, my dress. You know what? 

SARA	I’m going to go to the bathroom.

SARA	I’m sorry. Excuse me.

SARA	Shit.

SARA	Okay, we’ve got to stop meeting like this.

SHAD	So, this was all about a book? Yeah, I was right about you.

SARA	That's not fair. I care about your brother.

SHAD	No, you don’t care about shit.

SHAD	You're just one more person with their hand out...

SHAD	taking out what you want from him. 

SHAD	You're just like our fosters.

SARA	I have been looking for him.Where is he?

SHAD	No, I told you not to get involved with him, okay?

SHAD	Now he's got to put his pieces back together because of you.

SARA	What do you expect me to do? 

SARA	I can't help someone who won't even admit...

SARA	that they have a problem.

SHAD	A problem?

SHAD	No, you're the one with a problem. Now stay the fuck away from us.

SHAD	I won't ask again.

SARA	Where is he?

SARA	Well, what’s his address? I’ll find him myself. 

SARA	A last name, maybe?

SARA	Gee, thanks, Shad. Very helpful.

KELLY	It's finished?

SARA	Yeah.

KELLY	Oh, that was fast. I'm actually excited to see how this thing ends.

KELLY	So what's up with you and Godfrey?

SARA	I still haven't seen him.

KELLY	Sara, you need to find him and make things right.

KELLY	If he was pissed about your personal diary... 

KELLY	he's going to be even more upset...

KELLY	when your book is in every Barnes and Noble, knock on wood.

SARA	Well, his brother told me to stay away.

KELLY	So what? Who cares?

SARA	So, I’m staying away.

KELLY	I love you, but this manic pixie Dreamgirl...

KELLY	“I don’t know what’s going on” thing is really starting to piss me off.

KELLY	You forced your way into that man's life, and...

KELLY	you made a mess of it, and now that it doesn't suit your needs anymore...

KELLY	you're just going to walk away.

SARA	You were the one who told me to keep hanging out with him.

KELLY	Yeah, for inspiration, not to ruin his life.

KELLY	And honestly, the truth is this is your M.O.

KELLY	This is what you do. You bail when things get hard.

SARA	That is not true.

KELLY	No? You didn’t bail on Simon?

SARA	He broke up with me.

KELLY	You pushed him away because he didn’t fit your version...

KELLY	of what an artist should be, whatever that means...

KELLY	after you made him become an artist.

SARA	That is such bullshit, Kelly.

KELLY	Yeah, and there’s more, Sara, okay? You think everyone is a phony.

KELLY	Simon’s a phony, Ben and his friends are phony.

KELLY	Somehow no one but you is living their authentic life...

KELLY	and yet you are writing a book that you think is beneath you.

SARA	Because you wanted me to.

KELLY	I was perfectly happy representing you when you were writing...

KELLY	feminist allegories about the mermaid myth that sold five copies...

KELLY	but when I told you that you could make money writing garbage...

KELLY	you jumped at the chance.

KELLY	I am telling you this because I’m your friend.

SARA	Well, it doesn’t feel like you’re my friend.

KELLY	Well, friendship doesn’t always feel good...

KELLY	and I know you think I’m an asshole, but you know...

KELLY	I am a good friend, and I am a loyal friend...

KELLY	and friends tell each other the truth, even when it sucks.

SARA	Yeah, well this lunch sucks!

SARA	The food is very good, but the...

KELLY	The food is very good.

SARA	This sucks.

KELLY	Sara, do you see the guy over my shoulder?

SARA	Who, the bartender?

KELLY	No. The Buddha. 

SARA	Yeah. What about him?

KELLY	Do you know what he would say if he were to join this conversation?

SARA	No, I do not.

KELLY	He would say, “You need to follow the Eightfold Path.”

KELLY	It is the path that teaches us the importance...

KELLY	of actively helping others to free them from their suffering.

SARA	Okay. What do you know about Buddhism? 

KELLY	A lot, because I am a Buddhist, so...
 
SARA	You’re a Buddhist? 

SARA	You’re a Buddhist?

SARA	This whole time?

SARA	You... 

SARA	You’re a Buddhist?

SARA	You’re a Buddhist? 

SARA	She’s a Buddhist!

SARA	You’ve got to be the worst Buddhist I’ve ever seen! 

KELLY	If you reduce the world down to atoms and molecules...

KELLY	you see that we’re all just one big organism, and that...

KELLY	what we do as individuals has an effect on others.

KELLY	You have an obligation to help that man because in a way, you are that man.

SARA	Okay, I didn’t come here to get confused and lectured at.

KELLY	Who would go anywhere to be confused? 

KELLY	Like, why would you pay for that?

SARA	You know what? You have my book, so just leave me alone.

SARA	Ow. 

SARA	You should make sure there’s more space between the tables.

SARA SINGING	There are two of us on the run 

SARA SINGING	Going so fast, every doubt we had 

SARA SINGING	is coming undone 

SARA SINGING	And falling behind with everything we left there

SARA SINGING	We held on for far too long 

SARA SINGING	And now we pass so many people on the road 

SARA SINGING	They could come along 

SARA SINGING	I wish they'd been told 

SARA SINGING	They may call it a shot in the dark

SARA SINGING	From what we know

SARA SINGING	It's not unheard of 

SARA SINGING	And we'll one day 

SARA SINGING	tell our

SARA SINGING	story 

SARA SINGING	of how

SARA SINGING	we made 

SARA SINGING	something 

SARA SINGING	of ourselves now 

SARA SINGING)	Ooh Ooh 

SARA	Oh, my God. Hey! Hey! I know you! 

SARA	Hey! Hi! I know you! 

SARA	Can I... No, please. Can I just ask you a question? 

SARA	Please? Please? Please? Please?

GEKE	Well, if it isn't the DJ wannabe. 

GEKE	DJ Meow-na Lisa, right?

SARA	No, Sara. But, yeah. Hi.

SARA	I'm not really a DJ hype cat.

GEKE	No shit? What do you want?

SARA	I haven’t been able to find Godfrey. DJ Katamine.

SARA	Have you guys seen him?

GEKE	Not for a few weeks. 

GEKE	It’s like he dropped off the face of the planet of something.

SARA	What about Shad?

GEKE	Shad’s in jail.

GEKE	Got caught boosting mixers.

SARA	Shit! Seriously? 

GEKE	He’s going to be in there for a minute.

SARA	There’s got to be something I can do to help.

SARA	You should’ve taken the money.

SHAD	What are you doing down here?

SARA	Bailing your ass out of jail.

SHAD	Oh, yeah, right.

SARA	If you take me to him.

SHAD	I’ll take you up on that.

SHAD	Just to get away from that crazy mo-fo. 

SHAD	He’s a baby-faced serial killer.

SARA	But he looks so normal.

BOB	Maintain the integrity of the pitch.

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	Mr. Glasser?

BOB	But put it in your own words.

BOB	What?

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	I think there's something wrong with G-Money.

BOB	He looks fine to me.

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	He’s in his bathrobe, sir.

BOB	Does it turn you on?

OFFICE SUPERVISOR	Sir?

BOB	Chicken Little? “The sky is falling.” 

GODFREY	To begin again, press eight after you hear the beep. 

GODFREY	Beep!

UNIDENTIFIED CALLER #9	I'd like to change my order, please.

UNIDENTIFIED CALLER #9	Is this a real person I'm talking to?

GODFREY	I am a new BETA version of an...

GODFREY	automated voice system called Cray-bot. 

GODFREY	My name is John. 

UNIDENTIFIED CALLER #9	Yes, I'd like to cancel my web builder package, please.

GODFREY	Your credit card has been charged $125.60.

UNIDENTIFIED CALLER #9	Yes, as I just said, I’d like to cancel that order.

GODFREY	Your credit card has been charged $125.60. 

BOB	That man is a goddamn genius. 

MRS. MILLER	Hey, everyone, guess who's back?

MRS. MILLER	Mr. G’s back, and he’s going to play...

MRS. MILLER	some really fun music for you all.

GODFREY	Two volunteers, I guess.

MRS. MILLER	Okay, you heard Mr. G. Two volunteers. 

MRS. MILLER	Great. You guys are doing great.

MRS. MILLER	All right. Great job. Here you go.

MRS. MILLER	Hey, Mr. G, you all right?

SHAD	It's weird.

SHAD	He's here every day, but he ain't no character. Just like some sort of robot talking all monotone and shit.

SHAD	It's bad.

SARA	I really messed up, but I’m going to go talk to him.

SARA	Hey, Godfrey.

SARA	I know you’re mad at me, and I don’t blame you...

SARA	but I’m really worried about you. 

SARA	Do you need anything?

GODFREY	I have to go.

SARA	Oh, do you want to, like, DJ tonight or... 

SARA	I mean, Shad’s back. 

SARA	Me and him are going to break out his new mixer. 

SARA	DJ Meow-na Lisa in the house. You know?

SARA	Look, I know what happened to your sister, and I’m so sorry. 

SARA	Those fosters, they were supposed to protect all of you.

SARA	You have to forgive yourself. 

KELLY	Are you sitting down?

SARA	No.

KELLY	Doesn’t matter, because I am. 

KELLY	Guess what? Axi loves the book. Yeah. 

KELLY	They want to get together right away. 

KELLY	They want to talk film rights.

SARA	I can’t right now, Kelly.

KELLY	What do you mean, not now? You are such a bummer sometimes.

KELLY	Meet me at Axi tomorrow at 11:00.

KELLY	You sell this movie, the rest of them will follow, I promise you.

SARA	I got to go.

KELLY	What the hell, Sara?

AXI EXEC	Fantastic stuff, Sara, really.

AXI EXEC	So original, and oof! Compelling. 

AXI EXEC	So you guys might want to buckle up here...

AXI EXEC	because we're so excited. We want to do an initial run of...

AXI EXEC	100,000 copies...

AXI EXEC	and we’re going to up your advance to $350,000...

KELLY	That’s dollars. Fuck, yeah!

AXI EXEC	Also, multiple studios are already calling on the film rights.

AXI EXEC	You’re going to make some serious cash money on this.

KELLY	Fuck, yeah! That is what gets me hard in the fucking morning!

AXI EXEC	Whoo! Boners! Everyone has boners. 

KELLY	Oh, my God! I represent so many shitty writers now.

AXI EXEC	Yeah! Whoo!

KELLY	I needed this win!

KELLY	Oh, I’m so unhappy in my marriage. This is the only thing I am living for. 

KELLY	Aren’t you fucking pumped?! Aren’t you excited?! 

KELLY	She’s excited.

KELLY	She is, we are...

SARA	It’s truly... 

KELLY	...truly needing more money.

SARA	...unbelievable.

KELLY	Unbelievable.

AXI EXEC	You guys, if that got your cocks racing, get your seatbelts...

AXI EXEC	clickity-clack them back in, because guess what?

AXI EXEC	We’ve mocked up some covers to show. If you look on the...

AXI EXEC	Where are they? You’ve got one job.

AXI EXEC	One thing that you do.There it is. Wow. 

AXI EXEC	Slowly but surely.

AXI EXEC	We’ve even come up with some alternative titles. Check it out.

AXI EXEC	Okay, we’re going real retro kitschy.

SARA	I’m sorry. That’s...

AXI EXEC	Oh, she took it. She took the phone call. Hello?

KELLY	Regarding other...

SARA	Shad? I’m sorry. I can’t right now.

KELLY	Let’s stay focused here, and blonde to blonde.

SARA	What’s going on?

KELLY	What type of contingencies...

KELLY	are we looking at?

SARA	Okay.

SARA	I have to go. I have to go. I have to go.

KELLY	Where did she go? Is she still behind me?

SARA	My friend’s in trouble. I’m sorry.

AXI EXEC	Excuse me?

KELLY	Do you think she’s coming back?

AXI EXEC	I don’t know.

KELLY	Okay. I don’t...

AXI EXEC	Okay. Oh.

KELLY	Because we are not negotiating right now. 

KELLY	 I will call you when she is ready. Okay. 

SARA	hank you for being here.

KELLY	Of course.

KELLY	Why is everyone so tiny in this office building?

SARA	There he is. 

SARA	Hey, Shad.

SHAD	Thanks for coming.

SHAD	You know, shit’s just getting way over my head. 

SHAD	Who’s she?

SARA	Oh, that’s my friend, Kelly.

ROBERT	So I’m afraid we’re in kind of a bind here.

SARA	So what’s the issue?

ROBERT	Some parents noticed some odd things about Godfrey.

ROBERT	Many of them are wondering if he might be schizophrenic. 

KELLY	He’s not schizophrenic, and I will tell you why.

KELLY	One, he does not suffer from visual hallucinations. 

KELLY	Two, he does not suffer from auditory hallucinations...

KELLY	and three, he does not exhibit signs of delusional behavior...

KELLY	so there’s that.

SHAD	Is she a doctor?

SARA	She repped Dr. Phil.

ROBERT	Look, what do I tell a concerned parent... 

ROBERT	who said that she saw him performing as a cowboy on the street...

ROBERT	and then less than an hour later, dressed as a matador? 

SARA	What, he can’t perform now?

ROBERT	If a person is found mentally unstable, obviously...

ROBERT	they’re not going to be allowed to work...

ROBERT	with any children in Washington State.

SARA	No, no. Godfrey is not mentally unstable.

SARA	Okay? He is a man experiencing grief.

SARA	He doesn’t need a psych evaluation.

SARA	He needs support, and time to process what he’s going through.

ROBERT	Look, I appreciate everything that has been said here today.

ROBERT	But if Godfrey doesn’t grade out with his evaluations next week...

ROBERT	he’s done here.

SARA	Hi, my name is Cowgirl Cassie. 

SARA	Now I’m not really a performer, but today...

SARA	I decided to sing some songs for y’all...

SARA	and a friend I'm hoping to see.

SARA SINGING	You can tell the world 

SARA SINGING	I never was your girl 

SARA SINGING	You can burn my clothes up when I'm gone 

SARA SINGING	You can tell your friends 

SARA SINGING	Just what a fool I've been

SARA SINGING	And laugh and joke about me on the phone

SARA SINGING	But don't tell my heart

SARA SINGING	my achy breaky heart 

SARA SINGING	I just don't think she'd understand 

SARA SINGING	And if you tell my heart

SARA SINGING	my achy breaky heart 

SARA SINGING	She might blow up and kill her man

SARA SINGING	You can tell your ma

SARA SINGING	I moved to Arkansas 

SARA SINGING	You can tell your dog to bite my leg

SARA SINGING	Or tell your brother Cliff 

SARA SINGING	he can read my lips

SARA SINGING	He never really liked me anyway 

SARA	Hey there, young man.

SARA	Why don't you come on up here and join me on the stage?

SARA	Help me sing this song. Come on now. Don’t be shy!

SARA	Come on up here. I see you. Come on.

SARA	Get on up here.

SARA	Where you belong.

SARA SINGING	Or tell your Aunt Louise 

SARA SINGING	Tell anything you please 

SARA SINGING	Myself already knows I'm not okay

SARA SINGING	Or you can tell my eyes 

SARA SINGING	to watch out for my mind

SARA SINGING	It might be walking out on me today

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	But don't tell my heart

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	My achy breaky heart

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	I just don't think he'd understand

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	And if you tell my heart 

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	my achy breaky heart 

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	He might blow up and kill this man 

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	Don't tell my heart

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	my achy breaky heart

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	I just don't think he'd understand 

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	And if you tell my heart 

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	My achy breaky heart 

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	He might blow up and kill this man 

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	Don't tell my heart

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	my achy breaky heart

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	I just don't think he'd understand

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	And if you tell my heart

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	my achy breaky heart

SARA AND GODFREY SINGING	He might blow up and kill this man

SARA	Whoo, whoo, whoo!

SARA	Cowboy Cody, everybody. Give him a round of applause.

MAN IN	Yeehaw! 

SARA	Thank you.

SARA	Well, you got a smile on your face.

SARA	That's a good thing.

GODFREY	You think so?

SARA	Hell, I know so. 

SARA	So, we friends again?

GODFREY	Pretty good for someone who doesn't perform there, young lady. 

GODFREY	Maybe we should make a duo.

SARA	Yeah, like Faith Hill and Tim McGraw.

SARA	You could be Faith. 

SARA	So if we're going to be a duo, then we're friends now, right?

SARA	Because friends are there for each other. 

SARA	And I want to help you. 

SARA	Like you helped me. 

SARA	And I know I haven't met the real you yet...

SARA	but the truth is, I'm the one that's the phony.

SARA	I wrote books I don't care about. 

SARA	I was in a five-year relationship that I only pretended was great. 

SARA	I've been a phony... 

SARA	to friends, to everyone in my life.

SARA	I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you about the book.

SARA	But I learned so much about you and myself writing it. 

SARA	It changed me.

SARA	Look... 

SARA	you're going to lose your gig at the school...

SARA	if you don't show them the real you...

SARA	they're going to cut you from the program.

SARA	But the school is willing to work with you if you can pull it together.

SARA	They have counselors there to help you through this. 

SARA	And I could help you.

SARA	You just have to be yourself.

SARA	So what do you say?

SARA	Let's start over.

SARA	For real this time.

SARA	Hi. I'm Sara.

SARA	Okay. 

SARA	Well, then I guess that’s goodbye.

GODFREY	Wait, Sarah. Don't leave.

GODFREY	It's me. 

GODFREY	Godfrey.

GODFREY	I know who I really am when I'm with you.

SOUNDTRACK	Oh, once upon a midnight eerie

SOUNDTRACK	I woke with something in my head

SOUNDTRACK	I couldn't escape the memory

SOUNDTRACK	Of a phone call and of what you said

SOUNDTRACK	Like a game show contestant with a parting gift

SOUNDTRACK	I could not believe my eyes

SOUNDTRACK	When I saw through the thoughts of a trusted friend

SOUNDTRACK	Who needs to humor me and tell me lies

SOUNDTRACK	Yeah humor me and tell me lies

SOUNDTRACK	And I'll lie too and say I don't mind

SOUNDTRACK	And as we seek so shall we find

SOUNDTRACK	And when you're feeling open I'll still be here

SOUNDTRACK	But not without a certain degree of fear

SOUNDTRACK	Well, what will be with you and me

SOUNDTRACK	I still can see things hopefully

SOUNDTRACK	But you

SOUNDTRACK	Why you wanna give me a run-around?

SOUNDTRACK	Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?

SOUNDTRACK	When all it does is slow me down

SOUNDTRACK	Shake me and my confidence

SOUNDTRACK	About a great many things

SOUNDTRACK	But I've been there I can see it cower

SOUNDTRACK	Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

SOUNDTRACK	Of a bad play where the heroes are right

SOUNDTRACK	And nobody thinks or expects too much

SOUNDTRACK	And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights

SOUNDTRACK	Singing "Hey babe, let's keep in touch"

SOUNDTRACK	Hey baby, let's keep in touch

SOUNDTRACK	But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me

SOUNDTRACK	And show me all the things no one else can see

SOUNDTRACK	So what you feel becomes mine as well

SOUNDTRACK	And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell

SOUNDTRACK	What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine

SOUNDTRACK	And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

SOUNDTRACK	But you

SOUNDTRACK	Why you wanna give me a run-around?

SOUNDTRACK	Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?

SOUNDTRACK	When all it does is slow me down
