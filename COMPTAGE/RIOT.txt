??	In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

??	And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

??	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

??	All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.

??	And God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. and God saw the light, that it was good.

??	My name is Gordon Wilson.

??	For as long as I can remember,

??	I have loved the fish of the sea and the birds of the air  and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth.

??	That love has led me into science, into teaching and writing,into exploring and learning,  chasing and catching.

??	And God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind,” and it was so.

??	I am a creature among creatures, but I, like you, have been made in God’s image.

??	And God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind.”

??	And God saw that it was good.

??	The beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the seaand every creeping thing  have been given to us to tend, to know, to name.

??	In them we can see our Father's art,

??	His raucous joy and glorious personality.

??	And in them as in ourselves we can see the brokenness of this world, yearning for restoration.

??	I am a teacher, a writer, but first, I am a handcrafted creature.

??	And this...is my celebration of the world we have all been given, this world of Riot... and of Dance.

??	Gordon, you'll never be able to call yourself a biologist if you continue to hold the views about evolution that you demonstrated last week.

??	You're a bright person start using your own mind! Marc

??	That's a little note I received in graduate school many years ago.

??	I keep it hanging in my office to remind me whose team I'm on.

??	Of course I'm a biologist.

??	I study life, and that’s what biology means.

??	But in other ways it’s the least important part of me

??	First, I’m a Christian.

??	I’m the son of two, the husband of one.

??	I’m the father of five, the grandfather of seven, brother of three, and I’m the uncle of scads...dozens.

??	But in some ways, I’m not a biologist at all, at least in the secular sense. These days, a biologist is supposed to focus on naturalistic causes exclusively.

??	But when I look at the world,

??	I see the supernatural everywhere.

??	If we wanted to study somebody like Michelangelo, we would want to study everything that he wrote, everything that he made, all of his works of art, his paintings, his sculptures.

??	In the same way, the way you get to know God is to study everything that he wrote and made, the living creation.

??	They are not only paintings, they are sculptures.

??	And they’re sculptures that are living and breathing, nd they can reproduce, and they can interact.

??	I want to show you just a fraction of what's out there.

??	Like a hobbit, I’m gonna take you out my front door and then farther and farther away until we’ve reached the other side of this globe and faced a serpent or two, or three, or four...five.

??	The word of God is not just in black and red letters on onion skin pages.

??	It’s living and breathing in the mountains, the deserts, and the trees.

??	He glories in it, and so should we.

??	If you want to glimpse the majestic masterpieces of your infinite Creator, you don't even need to leave your corner of this living gallery in which we all exist.

??	Just stand...and breathe...and open your eyes right where you are.

??	In your own place.

??	Wonder is waiting for you just outside your door.

??	Call it photosynthesis if you want but these trees were crafted from thin air by the power of our nearest star.

??	Water that has flown above the globe in cloudy continents, that has fallen and risen and fallen again since the world was newborn, quenching the thirst of ferns and men, carving canyons, kissing flowers, hatching insects.

??	If you yearn to travel, hungering to see distant lands and exotic beasts... first see the things all around you that you have never seen before.

??	See them truly.

??	As gifts. As miracles.

??	When you have been amazed by the mundane, then you are ready to wander and explore.

??	This is my place.

??	The temperate conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest

??	As simple as the life may seem, y wonder starts here...with a squirrel.

??	Doing work.

??	The red squirrel. Birth length: one inch.

??	Full grown: one foot.

??	Job: jumping, yelling, shucking pinecones, and planting forests with hundreds of buried and or gotten seeds.

??	Here we have a solar powered barbecue.

??	A family of ants.

??	A slow-cooked earthworm.

??	And a squadron of massive, carnivorous, scavenging monsters in matching jackets.

??	Black and yellow jackets.

??	Hairy and armored.

??	Deadly.

??	But ants are harder to frighten than people.

??	The next time a yellow jacket settles on your plate, imagine if it was twenty times your size.

??	Now imagine being brave Enough o bite it on the head.

??	Or grab onto its belly, barely out of stingers reach.

??	Look near. Look small.

??	See what you can find.

??	And marvel.

??	Go to the ant. Sluggards.

??	My favorite mountain pond.

??	Heavy and still, a mirror in the trees.

??	Before setting out for distant places,

??	I decided to check in on this old friend one more time.

??	Surely, you have a pond nearby.

??	And no doubt it is more crowded with life than any zoo.

??	When cool pond water presses in around my legs and the insects scatter,

??	I am never bored.

??	To be bored in this world, is to be boring in this world. 

??	This is probably one of the highest densities of water striders I’ve ever seen.

??	When it catches prey, the water strider uses its sharp straw-like beak to slurp up its food.

??	Can you walk on water?

??	He can.

??	Every good pond has a nice fat frog.

??	This one is a Columbia spotted.

??	Just a frog right?

??	Well, try inventing one from nothing.

??	And make sure to include the strangeness of tadpoles.

??	These guys hibernate, surviving winters as far north as Alaska.

??	They also aestivate, which means they can go dry and dormant during high heat or drought, reviving with the rain.

??	Oh, beautiful!

??	The garter snake.

??	Possibly the most common snake in North America, which means they can make nature buffs yawn.

??	But snowflakes are far more common and each one is still a marvel.

??	And just like snowflakes, these snakes can pile up in drifts.

??	In Manitoba, Canada, tens of thousands of red-sided garter snakes winter together in massive den colonies.

??	Most people have strong feelings about snakes.

??	But how should we feel about them?

??	We’ll have that conversation later.

??	When the snakes are scarier.

??	For now, like all snakes, this one is stuck crawling on his belly in the dust and the mud. 

??	Eating frogs and insects and poisonous newts.

??	Gliding across the water.

??	God works with motifs.

??	Where His geological architecture is grandest,

??	His beasts often match.

??	Big beasts in thick coats can survive mountainous

??	Montana winters, sixty degrees below zero.

??	Granite and ice crack in the spring, while antlers are shed and regrown every year. 

??	In this corner of the global

??	Garden, it is all one song.

??	One play.

??	Man has been told to name these animals.

??	And here he has earned a gold star.

??	Pronghorn. Not an antelope.

??	Faster than any other animal on the continent, they can hit top speeds of  miles per hour.

??	The Moose. The tallest animal in the western hemisphere. 

??	Six and a half feet at the shoulder.

??	Would any other name suit that nose? 

??	And buffalo. Bison if you prefer. pounds of western nobility and comedy combined under a big woolly rug.

??	Bighorn sheep.

??	It isn’t hard to see how these warriors earned their name.

??	Elk, occasionally regal, occasionally goofy.

??	This bull elk has already shed his antlers and is just beginning to sprout new ones.

??	The antlers are bone, which can grow as much as one inch per day in the spring.

??	I can’t even imagine the head and neck aches  that must come from growing up to forty pounds of bone out of your skull.

??	I feel your pain big guy.

??	A mother moose will only keep a male calf with her for around  months before she drives him away to mate again.

??	But a female calf like this one might stay near her mother for years.

??	In the summer, these two together will eat well over  lbs of food a day.

??	But a long hard winter is their friend.

??	It’s the only thing that might get rid of the ticks.

??	Believe it or not, an adult moose can get stuck carrying more than seventy-five thousand ticks.

??	And to animals this size, disease is a more dangerous enemy than bears or wolves.

??	Bison used to cover this continent, ranging from Alaska to Mexico.

??	Now only fifteen thousand are generally considered to be wild and free range.

??	And because they can interbreed with cattle, even fewer are genetically pure.

??	These buffs, ranging in Wyoming, near the Montana border, are some of the few without any mooing domesticated ancestors.

??	Spin the globe and move west.

??	Out of the mountains and into the Pacific rains.

??	Out of the mountains and into the Pacific rains.

??	Where God has been using starlight to craft

??	Where God has been using starlight to craft wooden towers, older than the modern world.

??	If He’s spent two thousand years shaping something, can we spare the time to give it a glance?

??	The largest of these coast

??	Redwoods use more than a billion needles to stay healthy.

??	Which shouldn’t surprise us, because the dry mass of one of these trees pretending we could remove all the moisture from the wood is still well over four hundred tons.

??	And that mass is gathered from thin air, by those needles, powered by starlight.

??	And from here…skootch off the edge of the continent and down the cliffs.

??	Altitude: zero feet above sea level.

??	Few animals have a higher cuteness quotient than the harbor seals.

??	With the broadest global distribution of any seal, they are like the permanent puppies of the shallows.

??	This pod has chosen a sandy spit in central Oregon.

??	They are earless, but with a clearly visible ear canal that gets the job done, and their nostrils form a distinctive V.

??	Swimming and diving from birth, they are short, soft, and playful, although adults can grow longer than six feet and weigh almost three hundred pounds

??	The world may be cursed and fallen, and yes, there are hungry sharks and killer whales in the deep water, eager to snack on fat furry dumplings, but these seals live happily, sheltering on sandy beaches in shallow river mouths, where their biggest problem is something we can all relate to.

??	They itch.

??	Not all seals are so care free.

??	The Apostle Paul told the church in Rome that all creation groans for the resurrection.

??	It yearns to be made new.

??	Many people now believe that whatever we might come across in nature is sacred, and should not be seen as good or bad.

??	But a Christian should look at Everything through the lens of Scripture.

??	Step onto a California beach crowded with elephant seals and you are stepping onto a beach heavy with the curse.

??	Groaning everywhere.

??	Half ton mothers accidentally crush their young and leave their bodies to feed the seagulls.

??	Orphaned pups are bitten and chewed to death wherever they turn for help. five-thousand-pound bulls dominate smaller screaming females, and sneak attack the harems of others.

??	Bachelors are banished to their own beach until they are big enough to drive off another bull and steal his many captive wives.

??	In South America, the bulls grow even larger, weighing upwards of lbs  that’s more than five bull bison, or ten grizzly bears. 

??	Yes, they jiggle.

??	Yes, their bubbly noses fall into their mouths.

??	Yes, they look like critters from Star Wars.

??	Yes, they are powerful and amazing.

??	But this is not how the world was meant to be.

??	This is the result of the fall.

??	It is more Riot than it is Dance, and it is not how the beaches will be run in the resurrection.

??	I want people to see that

??	Life is not a basket of kittens, okay?

??	If I want to usher people into the glories and wonders of creation and you say,

??	 “Well, there’s all this death and predator-prey relationship and parasite-hosts.”

??	Yeah, all of those things are a result of the fall.

??	All creation groans, as it says in Romans.

??	So, we know that it’s broken.

??	But even in the midst of a fallen creation, the glories of God are still very, very present.

??	Man is broken.

??	Now we die, we age.

??	We need Redemption.

??	The creation needs Redemption.

??	People need Redemption.

??	We shouldn’t run away from it.

??	We should embrace it.

??	God has given us dominion over the whole creation.

??	We have to take that charge very seriously.

??	And in order to take Dominion we have to know  who are charges are, what they eat, how they live, what are their habitat requirements?

??	You can't just be ignorant of all of these creatures and be good stewards.

??	Many people say there is noobjective beauty in the world.
 
??	Those people are tragically blind.

??	Meet the Sonoran Desert. it’s almost twice the size of

??	New York state and is filled with some of the most unique habitats in the world.

??	I’ve wanted to scour it for as long as I can remember.

??	Especially with a camera crew.

??	Every good desert is full of fangs of every kind.

??	And so a lot of people think of it as  a very inhospitable place. It may be for you. But for a lot of creatures graced with the right equipment and lifestyles this is a great place to live.

??	Even without air conditioning.

??	See glorious artistry in the mountains, in the prickly pears.

??	Look a puma in the face.

??	Really look.

??	Know that its symmetry and grace was invented from nothing.

??	Who could do such a thing?

??	Only your Father.

??	Watch the desert wolves wander.

??	Stretch and yawn with the coyotes in the desert dawn.

??	How much of this world does God love?

??	How much has He given to us.

??	The answer is the same.

??	All of it.

??	Every prickle and every pebble.

??	Every storm, every breeze.

??	Every insect and every lizard.

??	Even when you look small,

??	His glory is big.

??	One of the best ways to catch a lizard is with a copper wire noose on a stick.

??	I use a partial fishing pole.

??	We just caught a Clark’s spiny lizard.

??	It’s in the fence lizard family.

??	This is a male and it has dark Patches on the sides of the neck. A nice blue throat patch.

??	Also some turquoise on the belly and on the sides of the tail.

??	Why? Because it’s pretty.

??	Like a very speedy reptilian flower.

??	Every scale is delicately keeled like a ship.

??	Or an aspen leaf with turquoise flecking.

??	If you zoom in at the eye you can see very lovely and intricate sculpturing.

??	We caught a zebra-tailed lizard. which is arguably the fastest lizard in the United States. It is also, I think, one of the most handsome lizards.

??	It’s a sand Lizard and has a shovel nose face that’s useful for burrowing.

??	This male also has beautiful turquoise and salmon colors.

??	And of course, it has zebra striping on the tail, which it loves to raise and fly like a banner when it’s not in a hurry.

??	The Sonoran Desert is the hottest in all of Mexico.

??	But when you get into the hills and the mountains, it is lush and green, and even the monsoon puddles are teeming with strange life.

??	This is a giant water bug.

??	It is a very effective underwater predator

??	It's got predatory forelegs

??	It has a dagger-like beak which it uses to pierce its prey and pump digestive enzymes, liquefying its prey, and then sucking up the predigested fluid.

??	If you were a tiny critter sharing its puddle, no science fiction author could make up something more frightening.

??	When it comes to dragonflies,

??	I think God is showing off.

??	In a wonderful way.

??	I love them, although not as much as

??	He does.

??	Here a mother lays eggs in water one at a time.

??	Aquatic turtles in the desert?

??	Why not?

??	Even here God provides for these  clunky little guys.

??	I wanted to visit the Santa Rita mountains in southern Arizona.

??	This is a nice shady ravine.

??	Perfect habitat for a Sonoran mountain kingsnake.

??	This beautiful snake is called the Sonoran mountain kingsnake.

??	Also called the Knobloch’s mountain king.

??	Its bright coloration you would think would be not very good camouflage, but when it's in the dappled leaf litter, it blends in very well.

??	While most King Snakes eat a lot of snakes even rattlesnakes.

??	This one mostly makes do with lizards.

??	We just caught a Yarrow spiny lizard

??	One thing that's characteristic about these lizards is they have a fishnet stocking pattern down the body.

??	If you look up close around this guy’s head, you can see orange mites embedded around his eyes and on the sides of his neck.

??	It’s a hard life out there.

??	Poor guy must itch.

??	Sometimes you can lull them to sleep with a belly rub.

??	Forget your troubles little buddy.

??	Are you grumpy? No?

??	Apparently you’ve made friends with me

??	Well, I think I’ll let you go.

??	Steer clear of the kingsnakes.

??	This is a juvenile. You can see his colors are still more drab.

??	And he’s got his own bad case of mites.

??	Not sure what they could do about that.

??	Life is tough all over.

??	This little guy is an ornate tree lizard.

??	Up close, it has a variety of autumnal hues.

??	It also has larger scaling on its backbone. 

??	Scurry on, friend. Find some tasty beetles and avoid the mites.

??	Yes, please!

??	This snake is called a coachwhip.

??	Colors vary, including everything from dusty pink to blood red.

??	Head like a sportscar.  miles per hour might not seem fast to you, but it is when you don’t have any legs.

??	That land speed make this guy one of one of the very fastest serpents in the western hemisphere.

??	And one of the grumpiest.

??	But chewing on my knuckle won’t do him any good.

??	The Seed of the Woman has already triumphed over the Seed of the Serpent.

??	Some animals hold a special Place in just about every heart.

??	Who doesn’t love watching hummingbirds hum?

??	Or sit?

??	Or stick out their long tongues and sip nectar?

??	All  species of hummingbird live in the west, ranging from Alaska to Chile. Which means Solomon likely never saw one.

??	How much would he have paid to meet one of these feathered jewels?

??	Or to watch one in slow motion?

??	With wings beating  times per second, slow motion is the only way to get a real look.

??	With hearts pumping  times per minute, one wonders if time itself is different for these territorial little fighters.

??	The very smallest the bee hummingbird in Cuba weighs only seven hundredths of an oz.

??	The largest the Patagonia hummingbird in South America is still only seven tenths of an oz.

??	Fabergé made around beautiful but lifeless eggs, valued at many, many millions.

??	How many of these miraculous birds has God made?

??	Hatched from how many tiny, hidden, divinely crafted pencil eraser sized eggs?

??	Darkness draws a veil on one world but reveals another.

??	Especially after rain.

??	Very heavy downpour this afternoon.

??	I’m sure it brought the toads out.

??	Here we have a red-spotted toad.

??	He just peed on me.

??	This little guy is aptly named because each wart is accented with a little splotch of red.

??	They're out and about, running around looking for insects

??	These warts, all over the toad’s skin are poison glands.

??	Especially, these two big lumps right behind the eyes called parotid glands.

??	Any predator who tries to eat a toad will be in for an extremely foul surprise.

??	How could an amphibian which needs constantly moist skin live in the desert?

??	Well, they have these handy little pelvic patches.

??	You can see the darker pigmentation.

??	That’s why they’re out after the rain.

??	They press those patches up against any damp surface and absorb moisture right up out of the earth, keeping themselves as slick and slimy as they need to be.

??	They’re very spunky.

??	I’m petting his belly to try to mesmerize him.

??	Nope. He's got places to be.

??	Be off, little one.

??	The toads aren’t the only poisonous beasties out and about after this storm.

??	Porcupines won’t really fling quills at you.

??	But tarantulas will.

??	Each of those abdomen hairs is a fling-able barb.

??	If you’re going to mess with one of these ladies, watch your eyes.

??	Bark scorpions can’t hide from a black light.

??	They might be small,

??	But they still can kill you with that sting.

??	Or just give you the worst hour flu of your life.

??	These tender mothers deliver their young live, and they carry their brood on their backs.

??	This is called a sun spider.

??	Which is ironic because it hates light, especially sunlight.

??	Scientists don’t really know what to do with it.

??	It’s not a scorpion, not a spider, not an insect.

??	It’s an amazing hunter with massive jaws that can account for up to a third of its six inch body length, making it strong enough to take down lizards.

??	In fact, measured in pounds per square inch, some folks believe these lovelies  have some of the strongest jaws in the Animal Kingdom.

??	Whether it’s running, hunting, or eating, it only goes full speed.

??	Science fiction authors, call your office.

??	Woah! Is that a snake?

??	Goodness! Look at that thing!

??	I’ve never, ever seen a threadsnake.

??	This is just amazing.

??	Tiny. Blind. Tracks ants by scent.

??	Small enough to invade anthills and feast.

??	Small or large, God’s creativity never dwindles.

??	Sonoran desert toad.

??	What a beautiful animal.

??	He's beefy!

??	Yeah.

??	Desert Toads also come in jumbo sizes.

??	The slime all over my hands right now is actually quite dangerous.

??	Toxic stuff.

??	Hallucinogenic even in trace doses.

??	And they're slippery!

??	He’s got some big kidney bean size parotid glands.

??	Beautiful gold eyes.

??	Princesses can kiss frogs all they like, but don’t go kissing a toad.

??	I think I’m done with all these toxic secretions.

??	And I think he’s done with me.

??	But there are worse poisons.

??	This is an adult sidewinder.

??	If he wasn’t scary enough looking already, the horned scales above his eyes make him even look more villainous.

??	Not a particularly big rattlesnake, but a pretty one.

??	We disturbed him while he was flattening his wide body against the dirt road to suck up heat.

??	These guys are pit vipers.

??	Which means, first and foremost, that they have infrared sensing pits between the eyes and the nostrils.

??	Those pits provide thermal imaging night vision.

??	They also have hollow syringe-like front fangs which fold back into their mouths when closed, and swing down to deliver venom when the mouth opens to strike.

??	The word viper may derive from a pairing of the Latin words vivus and parere the words for living and to beget as many vipers give live birth.

??	With a viper’s musculature and defensive posture, a strike is more like a lightning-quick quick fanged punch than a slap.

??	How are Christians supposed to view deadly vipers?

??	Especially vipers like this onewith such  amazing engineering and striking design from the horns to the pits to the swinging fangs and keeled scales and rattling  tail and looping gait?

??	Solomon marveled at the motion of serpents like this one.

??	Is that all we’re supposed to do?

??	Marvel?

??	Many people will kill them on sight, even if they aren’t a threat.

??	Is that God’s plan for them?

??	Total annihilation?

??	As sons and daughters of the second Adam, what are we supposed to do with the deadly serpents and other animals that seem like they would have no place in a new Eden? 

??	It’s a big conversation, and we’ll have it soon.

??	There's a certain spectrum that God has created.

??	Some are kind of what we would think mundane.

??	Well, think of our lives. Most of our days are mundane.

??	But we can glory in the mundane.

??	We can praise God and thank

??	God for the mundane.

??	And then occasionally, we have a wow of a day.

??	And God has made creatures that punctuate our ordinary, mundane lives, that we should be thankful for, with amazing wonderful days.

??	Now remember, the amazing  wonderful days are a minority of your whole life.

??	And it's the same with these amazing, beautiful reptiles, or beautiful birds, or beautiful fish.

??	We should thank God for all of them.

??	We can delight in the common, we can delight in the rare, we can delight in the ordinary, we can delight in the extraordinary.

??	I would say that God created it for what it is, the little brown jobs and then the majestic, or the beautiful.

??	And they all have their purpose, their role in nature, but their role in our lives.

??	They are our charges.

??	We are to manage them.

??	We are not to say, “Well this is common and this is boring, therefore it really doesn't need to have a place on this planet.

??	If it goes extinct, oh well.”

??	No...No.

??	God created all the creatures, and we can't just be worried about the panda bear.

??	We have to be concerned about all of the diversity God made.

??	About as far away from my own little home as I can possibly get, sitting in the sapphire sea south of India, you will find the beautiful island nation of Sri Lanka and her many diverse and tropical ecosystems  arid lowlands, lush jungles, dense rain forests, and even high elevation cloud forests.

??	In Sri Lanka, even the mundane is exotic to my American eyes, but the same overarching creative personality is just as obvious here as it is in my familiar ponds back home.

??	God loves the color green.

??	He loves working with feathers and scales and creeping things.

??	Still, this is a wing in God’s living art museum that I have never visited before, and I want to see…everything, no matter how impossible that might be.

??	You want to talk about mundane?

??	In an island with more than  species of birds, filled with exotic blue magpies and serpent eagles and wild peacocks and athletic hornbills and kingfishers and storks and egrets, the national bird is a wild chicken.

??	The brightly colored and resilient jungle fowl. 

??	Amazing, yes, but so…normal.

??	It’s all about perspective, isn’t it?

??	My own favorite?

??	The determined and diligent weaver birds.

??	Instead of finding a solid fork in a thick branch to hold their young, each pair of these weavers chooses a single swinging twig as a foundation for a new home often in one colonial tree.

??	And then they begin to weave their dangling basket nests  the most elaborately constructed nests in the world.

??	In Africa, hundreds of social weaver pairs will even build massive collective nests together like apartment buildings or tree top haystacks.

??	Those jumbo nests can be used by their descendants for more than a century.

??	Who gave these birds such desire?

??	Such faith? Such ability?

??	One can imagine God asking Job:

??	Did you grow the long grass for the weaverbirds and teach them to twist and knot and tie?

??	Do you send the breeze to swing their nests and rock their young to sleep at night?

??	Other birds, like the crested serpent eagle,  are far more princely. 

??	And frightening to creeping things.

??	But this crested serpent-eagle isn’t intimidating at all to smaller territorial birds intent on messing up his feathered crown.

??	Especially when he’s so intently focused on the ground

??	The Land Monitor is a beefy opponent in its own right, growing up to five feet long and weighing over twenty pounds.

??	As they are armed with vicious claws, unrelenting jaws and a powerful whipping tail,

??	I decided against grabbing even a smaller one.

??	This hawk-eagle definitely should have given it more thought with a maximum weight of around lbs, the bird is definitely out of its weight class with this dense lizard.

??	Even with talons buried deep in its sides, the victim monitor whips and bites and fights for more than an hour while peahens scream in panic all around.

??	Are they rooting for their fellow bird, or for the lizard, we couldn’t say.

??	But they find the fight disturbing.

??	As they should.

??	Finally, this exhausted bird can eat.

??	Another reptile killer.

??	A mongoose.

??	Made internationally famous by Rudyard Kipling and his tale of

??	Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,

??	I’ve wanted to meet one since boyhood.

??	Beloved for their willingness to take on even massive cobras, this one is focused on a lizard snack.

??	As most of them are.

??	The Water Buffalo.

??	Wild, these are now quite rare.

??	Endangered since the s, less than a thousand remain worldwide.

??	Smaller domesticated versions exist throughout Asia.

??	If you had to weigh a ton and live in the tropical heat, you’d love basking in the mud too.

??	Watch where you wade.

??	It’s not just the crocs and snakes you have to worry about here.
 
??	There could be a whole buffalo down there.

??	As beautiful as this world is, brokenness is everywhere, providing us glimpses that are far more Hell than Heaven.

??	Crows and Jackals and even a beautiful white-bellied sea eagle all wait their turns while a Warthog disembowels a dead buffalo. 

??	When Man fell, so did the world.

??	And now Death is something we all share.

??	But Eden is visible here, too.

??	Grace.

??	Strength.

??	Loveliness.

??	The rare Ceylon spotted deer found only in the dry forests of Sri Lanka moving through dappled light.

??	A lone wading elephant feeding on water lilies in front of a rock with the same shape.

??	Surely, these creatures belong in fairy tales.

??	Could any of us have made them up?

??	Massive and ponderous. Living between  and  years, they are loyal to their friends and family until death.

??	Their ability to grieve is unique among animals.

??	They gather together and mourn the loss of a single member of a herd  even performing burials with leaves and branches, and revisiting death sites years later.

??	They have even been known to travel many miles to gather and mourn the death of a human friend somehow aware of the loss over distance. 

??	All elephants are tusked in

??	Africa both male and female.

??	Only some of the males are tusked in Asia.
 
??	Gifted with long dexterous noses to use as both straws and arms, enabling them to reach the ground slurping water or picking grass.

??	Wrinkled, bristly, and baggy, only God could take so much comedy wrinkled skin,  saggy legs, bulging bellies, giant flapping ears, small eyes, long swinging noses and waddling backsides  and assemble them into creatures who are so…noble.

??	Others creatures remain entirely comic, if we don’t pay too much mind to their mischief.

??	The Hanuman langur is a leaf eater.

??	Named after a Hindu 

??	Monkey god, they are just as badly behaved as elephant seals.

??	In a troop this size, every infant shares a sire.

??	And should a new dominant  male take over, he will attempt to kill every nursing baby so that he can replace them all with new ones of his own.

??	But the langurs are quick.

??	This stunning leopard will hunt elsewhere tonight.

??	When we study God’s many, many words in nature, one of the first things that should become apparent is that His taste is often nothing like ours.

??	Sure, we love sunsets.

??	We love swaying forests and ancient sprawling trees. 

??	We love calm water reflecting the sky.

??	We love bunny rabbits and harbor seals. But what about things like…bats?

??	Giant bats. Flying foxes.

??	Gathered in city-sized colonies thousands strong.

??	Orange and fluffy in the center of black four foot wingspans with long finger claws.

??	Upside-down fruit eaters.

??	Even though they can fly at  months old, mothers nurse their pups until  months.

??	Full adulthood comes around  months.

??	Did God weave them from nothing?

??	Does he take pleasure in their squalling?

??	Then so should we.
 
??	At least if they aren’t stripping some poor farmer’s banana groves.

??	Would Christians ever dare to proclaim their hatred of any part of God’s Word?

??	This commandment or that promise.

??	This gospel or that psalm.

??	And yet, we are often quick to express hatred for God’s creative words enfleshed around us.

??	His living and breathing art.

C??	hristians should always be striving to become more like our Creator loving what He loves.

??	And we know his affections include a great deal more than ours do not just fruit bats, but our fellow fallen men and women too.

??	Everything that exists is here because of

??	God’s gracious creative affection.

??	And if he loves a thing, then so should we.

??	Even those creatures and People that are in rebellion against Him.

??	After all, everything here is groaning against death because of our fall.

??	The rainforests and jungles are filled with many familiar faces  and many foreign. 

??	Did my Father craft this giant millipede with  legs like piano keys?

??	Did He give it the job of eating the rotting leaves on the jungle floor?

??	Is it and all its kind, part of our inheritance?

??	Yes, it is, and I love it.

??	Bees of every kind?

??	Oh, yes.

??	They have much to teach and give us in their diligence.

??	Do we see divine artistry in spiders? We should.

??	This is a green garden lizard.

??	A plain name for such a beauty.

??	They like to hang out in low jungle shrubs and trees, feeding on insects.

??	Beautiful long tail.

??	The keeled emerald scales on the baggy throat   called a dewlap, are more beautiful than any ancient emperor’s armor.

??	And the intricate scalation around the eyes is gorgeous.

??	A lovely spiny crest that runs down the back to the hipbone.

??	Hold a lizard too loose and it might get away, but too tight and you might be damaging some interior organs.

??	I’d rather be too loose on it.

??	I’ve had a number of lizards unfortunately escape.

??	So you want to check out your jaw muscles?

??	Yeah.

??	There we go.

??	Many lizards love doing push-ups to prove their territorial dominion.

??	But they’ll boogie quick enough if something big enough to eat them comes along…like this rain forest water monitor.

??	An excellent swimmer and climber, this guy will eat any fish, birds, or lizards it can catch.

??	Of all the beauties I’ve seen in person, this green vine snake is near the top of the list. Its architecture is unlike any other.

??	Tightly arching ribs leave the belly as flat as a ribbon and enable it to stretch long distances between branches in its slow quest for frogs and lizards.

??	It is mildly venomous, but unlike a viper, the fangs used to deliver that venom are small and deep in the rear of its mouth.

??	I’m not worried.

??	Birds are learners when it comes to food preparation.

??	Orioles in Mexico know how to shuck Monarch butterflies, removing the poison gland.

??	Here, blue magpies very rare and carnivorous members of the crow family in fancy blue and brown outfits have learned to diligently rub the defensive barbs off of caterpillars before dining.

??	No rain forest is possible without rain. Lots of it.

??	Rain and sun. Sun and rain.

??	God’s constant gifts.

??	In places like this, wherever man goes, life follows, often in unintended ways.

??	Hang a light in the jungle and you will be hosting jumbo winged termites at dusk.

??	Bring the termites and you will have gecko guests immediately, competitive and greedy.

??	God provides for all of his creatures.

??	He gives them tastes and appetites, and then he fills them.

??	How tragic it would be to have these tiny lizards yearning for eggs and bacon and receive only termites?

??	Instead, he makes them desperately want what he has already arranged to give.

??	Feast little lizards.

??	Take the insects with gratitude.

??	We’ll take the bacon.

??	Above the rainforests, are the

??	lush cloud forests.

??	Watered by cloud vapor directly, these forests don’t need raindrops.

??	Up here as is the case everywhere not every critter is easily lovable, although I do my best.

??	Behold the land leech.

??	Quite small only two inches stretched but determined and armed with tiny teeth in both ends, enabling it to grab and climb.

??	Almost indestructible and virtually without predators, it works clumsily but relentlessly, stalking the scent of exhaled CO in search of blood.

??	And behold, God and I provide.

??	Back down in the hot lowlands, there is this lovely lady.

??	One of my bucket list animals that I have loved from boyhood, based solely on field guide illustrations.

??	The star tortoise.

??	Beautifully patterned, but still a harumphy little tank.

??	A vegetarian with powerful armored forelegs, useful for burrowing and barging through the long grass.

??	I have always wanted to see a hardwood floor, patterned off the design on this  shell.

??	Clearly, she is not as excited to meet me 

??	But at least she’s giving us a good look at her elephantine rear legs and feet  one of the features that distinguishes all tortoises from what we call turtles.

??	Alright. It’s time.

??	I won’t keep dodging it.

??	Let’s talk about snakes.

??	And not just the pretty ones.

??	The scary ones,

??	For more than  years, this man’s family has been at the forefront of their local battle between humans and serpents not through destruction, but with cures.

??	Long before scientists had even begun work on antivenins, this family had developed herbal remedies for the deadliest of bites, and they still house any bite victim rich or poor for as long as it takes to cure or bury them.

??	They also collect the serpentine perpetrators, along with some less deadly varieties.

??	An Indian Rock Python, nonvenomous, but with a powerful bite.

??	One of the most famous constrictors, and the model for most picture Bible artists when they’re choosing which serpent to cast as the original deceiver in the Garden.

??	This has a taste for chickens.

??	Which is why it’s now in captivity.

??	Forsten’s cat snake.

??	Up to seven feet long, but elusive and shy, with jumbo eyes and a triangular head that gets it mistaken for a viper.

??	This thing spend its days high up in trees or tucked into rafters.

??	More useful to have around than a barn cat if you don’t want a rodent or lizard problem.

??	Quick to strike when provoked, but it offers no venomous threat.

??	The common krait.

??	Slender, simply banded, often black or deep sapphire blue.

??	Subdued in daylight, this guy is still quite the killer.

??	A bite can feel mild enough that people often shrug it off only to die of respiratory failure soon thereafter.

??	One nip from him packs a punch that can easily outclass a cobra’s.

??	That neurotoxin causes paralysis by severing signals between nerves and muscles.

??	Which means when you die, it will be a result of suffocation, an inability to force your lungs to breathe.

??	And he’s not the only one that can kill…

??	The Russell’s viper.

??	This gent, a highly camouflaged lurker, literally kills thousands all over Asia and the Indian subcontinent every year, and it isn’t even an aggressive snake.

??	Imagine if it were.

??	Especially since it’s strong enough to hurl all five feet of its body length into the air when it strikes.

??	With swinging front fangs like a rattlesnake, it easily delivers some of the nastiest and complicated venom on the planet.

??	Among other effects, a drop or two of its venom can solidify a cup of human blood in seconds.

??	The Russell’s might be deadly, but the hump-nosed pit viper has a nastier attitude and a more sleek and unique design.

??	Around here, it’s a lightweight, but you still don’t want those retractable needle fangs anywhere in you. If its juice gets in your veins, expect your kidneys to fail.

??	Like a rattlesnake, its pit powered infrared vision means it can see you at night when you can’t see it.

??	But it won’t rattle out of politeness.

??	Yes, there are flying snakes, but they have no wings.

??	Slender and even beautifully floral in their coloration, these acrobats love to leap, and they are designed to do it well.

??	Able to flatten their entire bodies, they can slither across the air from tree to tree.

??	When leaping from a treetop, these snakes have been witnessed gliding more than one hundred yards before touching down.

??	Last, but far from least, the cobra.

??	Black cobras, brown cobras, spitting cobras, king cobras, there are more than two dozen different egg-loving types that will angrily flare their iconic hoods and fight.

??	All of them are venomous and the largest, the king cobra up to eighteen feet in length is truly terrifying.

??	One bite from a king delivers enough venom to kill twenty men.

??	These snakes are elapids, not vipers.

??	Which means their fangs are up front and fixed, not hinged, ready to deliver neurotoxins and cardiotoxins, racing to stop your lungs or your heart first.

??	This is a spectacled cobra.

??	Surly enough even to strike at shadows.

??	Rearing and slapping at you rather than coiling and punching like a viper.

??	Absolutely deadly.

??	Its cloudy eye scale tells us that it’s ready to shed.

??	Christians who take the Bible seriously, as I do, believe that a fundamental conflict exists between mankind the seed of the woman and serpents.

??	Statistics argue the same point.

??	The World Health Organization claims that , people are killed by venomous snakes every year.

??	And that’s a conservative number.

??	But will this struggle continue forever?

??	Isaiah makes us a glorious gospel promise:

??	The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den.

??	They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.

??	Either, Isaiah is saying that the gospel will triumph so completely and this world will be so transformed that even serpents will behave.

??	Or…there will be cobras in Heaven.

??	Or both.

??	So let’s play, cobra.

??	I brought water balloons.

??	Wait. You thought we were done?

??	We’ve barely even started exploring this world of God’s words…
