( “All I Got”)
(Episode 112)

ANDI	I’m sick of being a fool for love!	
DANNI	Previously on “Sistas”…	
KAREN	Zac came to the salon, talk about how much he love me.	
DANNI	Jerome, you know, he ain’t call me in forever.	
SABRINA	Calvin found my vibrator.  He shoved it so far up his ass, I couldn’t find it.	
DANNI	Oh, girl, you win.	
ZAC	I love her, and I’m so sorry that I didn’t give her the attention she needed.	
DANNI	The boy loves you, Karen.  He made a mistake.  Come get him out my house.	
KAREN	I just wanted to tell you that I want us to try and work through this.	
ZAC	You trying to poison me?	
JASMINE	So you’re the bitch my husband. You gonna answer me?	
ANDI	I don’t have anything to say.	
LESLIE	She knows.	
ANDI	Okay, well, then, there’s no need for you to be here.	
JASMINE	Oh, yes, there is.	
ANDI	Well, Miss Borders, I…	
JASMINE	Sit down, bitch!	
ANDI	I am not gonna allow you to come to my office and disrespect me.	
JASMINE	I said sit down.	
LESLIE	Please.  She didn’t want to come, but I convinced her.  Please.	
ANDI	And why would I sit down?  So you can destroy me?	
LESLIE	Miss Barnes.	
ANDI	(scoffs) You know what, do whatever you’re gonna do.  Okay?  I don’t have to be a part of this.	
LESLIE	Sit, please.  Please.	
JASMINE	You…are the lowest kind of whore there is.  You knew he was married, and you let me come in here, pour my heart out to you, and you knew.  I’m gonna have you disbarred and fired.  And your name?  That’ll be mud.  ‘Cause see, I have friends in high places in media, and I’m gonna make sure they know exactly what kind of pariah you are.	
ANDI	And that’s your right.	
JASMINE	Mmm.	
ANDI	Have a good day.	
LESLIE	No, no.  Now, listen.  I was telling her she needed to come and get that off of her chest.  And you deserve that.	
JASMINE	That and more.	
LESLIE	I wanted her to come ‘cause I think you could help her.	
JASMINE	Ha.  I don’t want her help.	
LESLIE	But you want all of his money.  Now, Miss Barnes, I think you could be very helpful to her.	
JASMINE	Why would I work with her?	
LESLIE	You want to tell her?	
ANDI	I could help make your case stronger.	
LESLIE	And after all the hell he’s put you both through, I think you should consider it.	
ANDI	And what’s in it for me?	
JASMINE	Nothing.	
LESLIE	She will sign an affidavit saying that you recused yourself the day she walked in here.	
ANDI	Indemnifying me and my firm?	
LESLIE	Yes.	
ANDI	(sighs) Okay.  What do we do next?	
JASMINE	I’m not doing nothing until you tell me everything.	
ANDI	Okay.	
JASMINE	Talk.	
SINGER	When my girls hold me down, them boys mess around.  My love life is erratic.  We goin’ out tonight ‘cause I’m lookin’ for love, for love.	
ANDI	What do you want to know?	
JASMINE	No.  We’re not doing that.	
ANDI	Doing what?	
JASMINE	That.  You spoon-feeding me information?  (scoffs)	
ANDI	Leslie, I’m not gonna be able to talk to your client if this is--	
JASMINE	No, talk.  Just talk.  Come on, tell me how you met him.	
ANDI	I was out of tea.  It’s a tea that I love. And I went to my favorite grocery store, and he was there.  I was looking a mess, and I couldn’t reach it.  So he said, “I could reach it for you.”  And he did.  And we talked, and he told me his name was Gary.  And he told me he liked my bunny slippers.  I had on bunny slippers.  I told him that I was really cute and that he just caught me on an off day, that I never leave the house looking a mess.  And he said…”You’re beautiful the way you are.”  And he said that if he wasn’t married he would ask me out.  And I told him that he has no idea how much I appreciated his honesty.  And that was it.  I left.  But then, I came back 2 weeks later after work…Dressed to the nines.  And he said, “Damn.”  And I said, “What?”  And he said, “You told me you were cute…but I told you you were beautiful.  So I win.”  And then he said, “Tell me something.”	
JASMINE	“Why are you here alone?”	
ANDI	How do you know?	
JASMINE	(sighs) And then he started telling you about all of his humanitarian work?	
ANDI	Yeah.	
JASMINE	And then he told you about how much he loves his family, his mom?	
ANDI	How do you know that?	
JASMINE	Hmm.  Modus operandi.	
LESLIE	He told her the same thing.	
JASMINE	(inhales) But he wasn’t married.  How could you do that?  How could you be with a man knowing that he was married?	
ANDI	He said he was unhappy and that he was divorcing you.  And he said that…he said that you…	
JASMINE	Say it.  Say it.	
ANDI	He said that he was very sexual…and that you had an emergency with your last child and had to get an early hysterectomy.	
JASMINE	He told you that?  Finish talking!	
ANDI	He said…he said that he feels alone when he’s with you…And I make him happy.  He says that…I make him feel wanted again. It was months of him trying before I even went to coffee.  But then he got in my head.  He just…	
JASMINE	Have you ever been inside of my house?	
ANDI	Never.  I would never do that.	
JASMINE	Is this your earring?	
ANDI	No.	
LESLIE	She found that in her bed.	
ANDI	(sighs) I’m sorry.	
JASMINE	you don’t get to be sorry.  You don’t get to be sad.  He’s my husband.  He’s mine!  I hope all the pain that you have caused me and my children comes to live with you in your house and your heart every day.  (sniffs), I  hate you!  I hope you live a long life full of pain and misery on purpose.	
LESLIE	Wait, Jasmine…	
JASMINE	No, no, no.  I can’t do this.	
LESLIE	I think if…	
JASMINE	I said I can’t do this!  (crying)	
LESLIE	I will talk to her.	
ANDI	(sighs) What does that mean?	
LESLIE	She wants to sue you and this firm and have you disbarred. Sorry.	
ANDI	(sniffles) I did it.	
LESLIE	Okay.  Well, I will talk to her, but…here’s my card.  If you can think of anything at all that can help her, I want you to let me know.	
ANDI	(sighs)	
KAREN	Huh!  Look at you!	
ZAC	Look at you.	
KAREN	What is this?	
ZAC	It’s what I call a little breakfast in bed.	
KAREN	Oh.  But, uh, you don’t cook.	
ZAC	Don’t judge me.  Don’t--don’t judge me.	
KAREN	Zac, you know I got a sensitive stomach, babe.	
ZAC	I know that…but I know you gonna like this.

ANDI	You have clients, so you need to go to work.	
KAREN	How you know that?	
ANDI	I went there first, and when they told me that you were running late, I knew Zac was back.	
KAREN	All right, I know.  I know, I know I’m stupid.

KAREN	Good luck!	
ANDI	I need it.	
KAREN	Everybody got drama.  Shit.	
SINGER	Don’t you want somebody to love when you’re lonely?	
KAREN	(sighs)	
SINGER	Don’t you want somebody to lighten your load?  Don’t you want somebody to think of you when you’re away?  Don’t you want somebody, somebody like me?	
SABRINA	Hey, girl!	
DANNI	Hey!  What you doing here?	
SABRINA	I like to watch the planes take off.	
DANNI	Oh, girl.  Don’t give me that What you doing?	
SABRINA	So, we never talked about the Calvin thing.	
DANNI	Ah, no, yeah.	
SABRINA	(inhales) What--come on, Danni.  You’re not gonna give me your opinion?  You don’t think the whole vibrator thing was a little…weird?	
DANNI	Well, you know, that has never happened to me, so…it’s uncharted territory.	
SABRINA	Really?	
DANNI	No.	
SABRINA	Damn.	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	I mean, ‘cause, you know, you’re the freak of the group, and if you’ve never really tried it, then…	
DANNI	All right, how did I get to be the freak of the group?	
SABRINA	Remember that guy…that you slept with with no leg and a plastic penis?	
DANNI	Ah!  Yes.  I was curious.  You know, he’s still touring with the circus?  Good for him.	
SABRINA	Oh, Danni.	
DANNI	What?	
SABRINA	What am I gonna do?  I really like him.	
DANNI	(gasps) Look, I have an idea.	
SABRINA	What?	
DANNI	Why don’t you ask Karen to try it on Zac?	
SABRINA	No.  What--no.  How am I gonna ask her that?	
DANNI	Well, this might help you.  You know, guys might be into that these days.	
SABRINA	The only guy that I know that’s into that, he’s not straight.	
DANNI	Sabrina, just ask her.	
SABRINA	No.  What am I supposed to do, just, “(gasps) Oh, hi, Karen.  Yeah, is Zac home?  Do you mind putting a vibrator up his ass?”	
DANNI	All right, just ask to do the finger test.	
SABRINA	What’s that?	
DANNI	That’s when you put your finger up his ass, and you see how much he protests.	
SABRINA	I’ve done it.  Well, tell me what happened.	
DANNI	Okay, well, you have to see how much they protest.  You know, if the lady protests too much, that’s too suspect.	
SABRINA	Okay, you know what…	
DANNI	Okay.  But if it’s a little bit, it’s okay.	
SABRINA	Actually, never mind, girl.  I’m losing brain cells by the second with this ignorant conversation.	
DANNI	Well, girl, don’t ask me then. .	
SABRINA	Fine.	
DANNI	Oh.  Okay.  This is Karen now.	
SABRINA	Oh, she’s calling you?	
DANNI	Ha!  Girl, please.	
SABRINA	What?	
DANNI	What you want?	
SABRINA	Don’t talk to her like that.  Hey, Karen!	
DANNI	Oh, Sabrina’s gonna be in her car in about 10 minutes, and she has something very important to ask you.

SINGER	(singing indistinctly)	
SABRINA	Hey, girl.	
KAREN	(on phone) Hey.  What were you doing at the airport?	
SABRINA	Um…nothing, just talking to Danni.	
KAREN	(on phone) About Calvin?	
SABRINA	No, girl.  I’m not thinking about him.	
KAREN	Okay, wait.  Who are you talking to?	
SABRINA	So…how was your night?	
KAREN	Oh!  Deflecting?  It was good.	
SABRINA	I’m not deflecting.  I’m just really curious about how your night was.	
KAREN	(on phone) It was good.	
SABRINA	So, is he…	
KAREN	Yes.  He’s back.	
SABRINA	Good!  Good, good, ‘cause I’m so happy that you guys are together.	
KAREN	Thank you, but we gonna take it slow.	
SABRINA	That’s good, too.	
KAREN	(on phone) Did you talk to Andi?	
SABRINA	I called her.	
KAREN	She’s not in the best place, so we all gonna go over there after work.  I already talked to Danni.	
SABRINA	Oh!  Good.  I’m glad you guys are making up.	
KAREN	(on phone) Uh, stop it.  (chuckles)	
SABRINA	What?  Okay.	
KAREN	(on phone) I’m still not fully over it, so…	
SABRINA	I know, but at least we’re on the path.	
KAREN	Yes, we are, and speaking of path, what did you want to ask me?	
SABRINA	Hmm?  I didn’t want to ask you anything.  I mean, that was Danni.	
KAREN	Sabrina, what is it?	
SABRINA	(on phone) Do you have a vibrator?	
KAREN	Girl, I know you is not about to ask me to borrow my vibrator.	
SABRINA	(on phone) No, no, no.  Who would do that?	
KAREN	Danni.	
SABRINA	Has she?	
KAREN	What you askin’ me about herb for, huh?	
SABRINA	Herb?	
KAREN	Yeah, that’s what I named it.  Long story.	
SABRINA	So you think now that Zac is home that maybe you can try it on him?	
KAREN	(on phone) Whoa.  Whoa!  What?	
SABRINA	It’s the finger test.  You know, like where you…kind of reach around and see if he likes his butt being played with.	
KAREN	Sabrina, first of all, I know for a fact that he hates me touching his butt.	
SABRINA	(on phone) Really?	
KAREN	Yes, girl.  Every time my hands go near that area, he just…grabs them and pins them down.	
SABRINA	(on phone) Okay.	
KAREN	Yeah, I’m getting kind of hot thinking about it.	
SABRINA	Okay, Karen, that’s too much.	
KAREN	But, uh, anyways, I know you’re asking me ‘cause of Calvin.	
SABRINA	I know, but why do I want him to be something else?	
KAREN	Do you want him to be something else or do you just want him to not be gay?	
SABRINA	Honestly, I don’t think he’s gay.	
KAREN	(on phone) So it sounds like you like him.	
SABRINA	Yeah, I do.  But I’m just not comfortable with the whole panties and the vibrator.	
KAREN	Well, then stop seeing him.	
SABRINA	(on phone) But it’s also the best sex I’ve ever had.  Oh, my God, Karen, it’s like he’s inside of my brain or something.  It just…every time we’re together, it feels like a cold sip of water on an empty stomach.	
KAREN	(on phone) What you talking about, girl?	
SABRINA	His sex, girl.  His sex is amazing.  It’s so good.  It’s all about me.	
KAREN	Was the vibrator about you?	
SABRINA	No, that was all about him.	
KAREN	Well, did it turn you on?	
SABRINA	(on phone) No.	
KAREN	Okay, well, maybe you was just too in your head.  Maybe just, I don’t know, try it again.	
SABRINA	Mm-mmm.  No, Karen.  No, no.  I don’t think I could do that.	
KAREN	(on phone) Oh, my gosh.  Stop being such a prude and do what you got to do, okay?	
SABRINA	Okay.  Oh, I’m glad you’re happy.	
KAREN	Listen, we all gonna be happy, okay?  We will.  I’ll see you tonight.	
SABRINA	(on phone) And he wants me to buy a bigger one.	
KAREN	What?  Buy it.  What’s wrong?	
SABRINA	Bye.	
KAREN	Bye.	
SYLVIA	I’m sorry, we can’t do that.	
DANNI	Okay, what is the problem, Sylvia?  Sylvia.	
SYLVIA	(sighs) His miles don’t cover the upgrade.	
DANNI	Okay, I got it.  Excuse me, Sylv.  Thanks, girl.

PRESTON	Was that your boyfriend?	
DANNI	Uh, no, no, no, no.	
PRESTON	Oh.  Okay.	
DANNI	Why?  Is there an issue?  I can handle it.	
PRESTON	No, I didn’t--I really didn’t want to…I was really kind of hoping I could get your number.	
DANNI	Sir, I don’t know this desk’s phone number.  If there’s a problem, I can handle it.

PRESTON	And this is embarrassing.	
ALICIA	He is shy.  He never dates.  But he cannot stop staring at you, so I told him to come over and say hi.  I’m Alicia.	
DANNI	Hi, Alicia.  I’m Danni.	
ALICIA	Hi.  Yeah, he’s been staring at you since we got here.	
DANNI	(softly) That’s scary.	
ALICIA	Oh, no, not--not in that kind of way.	
DANNI	I get it.	
ALICIA	You got this.	
DANNI	Talk…	
PRESTON	I’m kind of new to this…sort of thing.	
DANNI	Why?	
PRESTON	What do you mean?	
DANNI	Uh, how old are you?	
PRESTON	I’m 34.	
DANNI	And you’re new to asking girls out?	
PRESTON	It’s not…it’s a long story.	
DANNI	Yeah, I’ve got time.  You’re gonna need to…	
PRESTON	Unfortunately, I don’t.  They just called for my flight.	
DANNI	Know what, why don’t you give me your number and I’ll call you?  There you go.	
PRESTON	Really?  You’ll call me?	
DANNI	Yeah.	
PRESTON	Well, I just moved here, and it would be great to have someone like you show me around.	
DANNI	Well, you might get lucky.	
PRESTON	That’d be nice, too.	
DANNI	Okay.  Well, go over there so you can watch me walk away.	
PRESTON	(chuckles) You’re funny.

HELANA	Well, I need to talk to you.	
ZAC	You didn’t hear what I said.  I said I just got back with my girlfriend.  Helana, you’re a great girl.  I’m sure you’ll find a great guy.

ANDI	Who is it?	
LESLIE	it’s Leslie.	
ANDI	(sighs) What are you doing here?	
LESLIE	Can I come in?	
ANDI	I don’t want you in my house.	
LESLIE	Please.  I--I’m just trying to help.	
ANDI	Why?	
LESLIE	Because I don’t think this is your fault.  It’s his.  And that son of a bitch should pay.  Please, just let me come in.  Let’s figure this out.	
ANDI	Come on.	
LESLIE	This place, really nice.	
ANDI	Thank you.  I’ll be selling it soon.	
LESLIE	Oh, I’m sorry about that.	
ANDI	What’s she saying?	
LESLIE	She’s actually downstairs in the car.  She wants to talk.	
ANDI	Look, I am not in the mood for this, okay?  I am done with all of this.	
LESLIE	She’s very emotional.  You have to understand that.  She gave this man her life.	
ANDI	I get it.	
LESLIE	She just wants to come up and see your place.	
ANDI	Why?	
LESLIE	I think she’s just trying to put it all together.  I want you two to get this son of a.  For everything he’s got.  And you all are stronger together.  And you, you’re solid.  You’ll take him out.  I know how you work.	
ANDI	Look, I am done with this.	
LESLIE	You are not a quitter.	
ANDI	You do not know me.	
LESLIE	I know a lot about you.  Spellman, Stanford, working study hall.  I know you.	
ANDI	Well, if you knew me, you’d know that I was telling you to kiss my ass right now.	
LESLIE	Mmm.  Nothing would give me more pleasure.	
ANDI	Are you flirting with me?	
LESLIE	I’m trying to help you.	
ANDI	Are you a lesbian?	
LESLIE	Yes.	
ANDI	Well, I’m not.  And this is extremely unprofessional.	
LESLIE	I don’t work for you.  Let her come up.  I think you could really help her to understand everything.	
ANDI	Get out.	
LESLIE	You’re a beautiful, good girl.  You don’t deserve this.	
ANDI	Is that her?	
LESLIE	I told her to wait in the car.	
ANDI	You know, I am really sick of this Hey.	
GARY	I couldn’t wait to see you at lunch.  So…Hi.  I’m Gary.	
ANDI	Oh, this is Tina.  Tina was just telling me there was a package for me downstairs in the car.  Could you go and get that package, please?	
LESLIE	Yeah.	
GARY	(chuckles) How are you?	
ANDI	I’m pissed.	
GARY	Why?  What’s going on?	
ANDI	Come, let me show you.

GARY	You have to let me explain.  All right?	
JASMINE	Please do. I would love to hear it.  Oh, no, no, no.  Please don’t get quiet now.	
GARY	Okay, um…

GARY	Andi.

GARY	Gary: Andi.  Okay.	
LESLIE	Okay?	
GARY	Yeah, as long as I can have you.	
JASMINE	(scoffs) What did you just say?	
GARY	Jasmine, I don’t love you anymore.  I’ve told you that over and over again.	
JASMINE	You never really gave us a chance, though.	
GARY	We went to counseling for 3 years, Jasmine, and it didn’t work.  I love you as the mother of my kids.  Why can’t you get that?  Look, I don’t want to be with you anymore.  I love her.	
JASMINE	How dare you say that to me?	
LESLIE	You love her?  And this woman, too?	
GARY	What are you talking about?	
LESLIE	Her, at the airport.	
GARY	That’s Gracie.  Jasmine, you know Gracie.	
LESLIE	Why are you hugging her?	
GARY	What the hell have you been telling her?  Hmm?  You’re some damn private eye if you don’t know who her damn sister is.  Andi, listen, we went to new Mexico, only for me to find out that you lied.  Your mother was fine.  Her whole family is twisted and  up.	
LESLIE	What about the whole…	
GARY	Shut the up.  How much money are you paying her to drum up this bullshit?  How much of my money?	
LESLIE	It’s her money.	
JASMINE	Thank you.	
GARY	It’s her money?	
LESLIE	Mm-hmm.	
GARY	You want it?  Here. Take it!  You can have all this.  I don’t care about none of this.  All right?  You can have it all.  Andi, I’ll give all this  up, all right?  I’ll give all this up, baby, if I can have you.  Please, don’t believe any of that, Andi.  I love you.	
JASMINE	You would walk out on our kids?	
GARY	I love my kids.	
JASMINE	And you know what, they hate for this .	
GARY	Because all the  you’ve been telling them.  Andi, I love you.  I love you.  But this  right here, you could have just told me.	
ANDI	Sorry.  (crying)	
GARY	Move from the door, Jasmine.	
JASMINE	You’re just gonna walk out like that?	
GARY	Jasmine, move from the door.	
JASMINE	No.	
GARY	Move!  You’re doing this right now?	
JASMINE	Looks like it.	
GARY	You may want to move her.	
LESLIE	Jasmine, you should move away from the door.  Now.	
JASMINE	That son of a .  No.  No, he’s gonna be sorry.	
LESLIE	Jasmine, you got him right where you want him.  He’s gonna give you half.	
JASMINE	No, no, no.  I don’t want half.  I want it all.  And I want this  disbarred. You  the wrong husband.
