(FRIENDS NEAR AND FAR GINA)

THOMAS     	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS     	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS     	I wonder where they are now. 

STORYTELLER     	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER    	The Great Railway Show had only just finished. Lots of trains were heading to the docks to get the boat home.

STORYTELLER  	Vinnie and Gina were the first ones to arrive. 

STORYTELLER	'Beat you!' laughed Vinnie.

STORYTELLER	‘You know, I'm probably the strongest steam engine in the world’. 

STORYTELLER	Gina had had enough... she decided that she was going to teach Vinnie a lesson.

STORYTELLER	And when she saw Shane arrive, a plan started to form. 

STORYTELLER	'You say-a you're-a strong, but I bet you're not even as strong-a as a-me!'

STORYTELLER	'Pah! A little engine like you couldn't even pull my coal tender!'

STORYTELLER	‘Hah! Then let us have a tug of war!' 

STORYTELLER	'You're on!' 

STORYTELLER	But Gina was going to play a trick on Vinnie. She went to see Shane.

STORYTELLER	'Vinnie doesn't think you are very strong and he's challenged you to a tug of war!'

STORYTELLER	‘Bonza’.

STORYTELLER	So Shane was coupled up to Vinne. But Vinnie thought it was Gina that he was going to be tugging against.

STORYTELLER	'Are you a-ready!?' Gina called.

STORYTELLER	'I'm ready!' Be careful you don't break an axle!' 'Go!' 

STORYTELLER	Shane and Vinnie puffed and chuffed as hard as they could.

STORYTELLER	'She's stronger than she looks,' 

STORYTELLER	They were both very strong, but their coupling wasn't strong enough for this tug of war... 

STORYTELLER	'Warrgh!' yelled Vinnie as he shot forward. Vinnie went straight into the watermelon container. 

STORYTELLER	'Awww nooooo!' 

STORYTELLER	Gina and Shane couldn't help laughing. 

STORYTELLER	'Sorry Vinnie.' Said Gina, 'But you were-a showing off!'

STORYTELLER	'That's okay tiny trucks! 'You may not be stronger than me, but you're a lot smarter!'

THOMAS     	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
