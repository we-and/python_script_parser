NOLA	Can I be honest? When Opal cut me off...it hurt like a Muthafucka. I thought we had a connection. I lit up a Joint, finished some Work Iím about to Show and I have ended my ìMan-Cleanse.î I will admit, I am still trying to understand the meaning of Commitment and what it means to Trust someone. Even if sthat someone is Me and learninghow to Trust my Intuition and not  my Impulses. All I can say, is that Iím a Work in Progress. However, Iím Back in the Saddle. Punintended. It might seem as if I am  kinda scattered right now but I would never say it like that. I would say it in a way the empowers me. Instead of saying, I wasscattered, I would say that I was  Multi-Tasking by replacing one phrase for another, I have shifted the Balance of Power. And what is Power? Is it the ability to define? Definition is not only the meaning of a Word but how you say that Word and who you say it to. I will admit, I am still in the process of defining who I am and sometimes what I Say and Do gets Lost in the Translation of My Life. Words have consequences, both Good and Bad. And if thatís the case, Do All Words Matter? Whatdoyathink?

MARS	Manny. Genna. Come through. Y’all recgonize this tag?

MANNY	I have seen the Tag before but I donít know dis Cornball Dude. Weíll ask around.

GENNA	Onyx is Sippiní dat Haterade.

MARS	Foí Sho, Foí Sho. If you find out anything, hit me up.

MANNY	We got you.

GENNA	Well I don’t know the artist is behind the work but I love the  work.

NOLA	This is great Work Guys. It seems you really dug deep to reflect the images of your lives in these Album Covers.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Very interesting work, Class. Very...provocative.

HASSAN	Whatís that mean, Ms. Moss? Provocative?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Provocative...in the way I was using the term Hassan, means just what I said. The Work the Class has  done is interesting.

KERVON	Yeah Hass...provocative like interesting, like that time when your Mom’s Big-Ass Titties fell outta dat Low Cut Top, when She was chasin’ your Ass down da Street last summer.
HASSAN	No, Kervon, it’s provocative like interesting like your Mom. Y’Know She Got One Leg With a Kickstand!

KERVON	Nice one.

HASSAN	Just Jokes My Nigga, just Jokes.

NOLA	No, its more than just Jokes. You guys were playing The Dozens. You’re putting down the Women who gave birth to you. Remember...they are your Mothers. 

RAQUELETTA MOSS	That’s a good point Ms. Darling. But right now,we need you to Pull Focus. We are here to Work.


NOLA	Reggie. Wow...your Work is...

NOLA	...It’s provocative, in the best sense of the Word. The strongest sense of the Word. Wouldn’t you agree, Ms. Moss?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Ms. Darling this is your Class. I am not here to impose my Views. I am just here  to observe...but yes, Reggie’s work is very powerful. 

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Walk, don’t run Ladies and Gentleman.

NOLA	See you next week, Guys.

THE HARRIET TUBMAN STUDENTS	See you next week, Ms. Darling.

REGGIE	You really think my work is Dope like that, Ms. Darling?

NOLA	Absolutely.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Absolutely Reggie.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Ms. Darling, I wanted to commend  you on your Work with the Students.You seemed to have established a real rapport with them.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	However, I would like for you to stop by my Office so we can discuss a few things.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Say tomorrow afternoon, Ms. Darling? Three-Thirty?

NOLA	Of course Ms. Moss. Three-Thirty it is.

NOLA	Yo! Yo, Mars!!

JAMIE	Mars? I’ve been told I take Ladies to the Moon! Must be my Interplanetary Tongue Game.

NOLA	Yeah Jamie. Your Tongue Game sent me Flyin’ to Mars. It was Stanley Kubrick 2001 Space Odyssey good.

JAMIE	Even without the Wood...I knew I could. So you forgive me now? You off your cleanse?

NOLA	What was that? I’m crying. That was some Transcendental Type...I don’t even know what to call it.

JAMIE	I’ve missed you so much...did we really have to take that Break?

JAMIE	It’s moments like this when I know I want to be with you All The Time.

NOLA	Where did that come from?

JAMIE	It came from my Heart Nola. I want to be with you. And Only you. I mean that.

NOLA	Wow. I am Honored but Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered. I Love the way you make me Feel Brand New.

JAMIE	So you’re saying I’m the one. The Only One?

NOLA	No. I’m still going to see other People.

JAMIE	What Nola gets Nola doesn’t want.

NOLA	You sound like Stokely.

JAMIE	Stokely? Who’s Stokely? One of the Dudes you’re seeing?

NOLA	Stokely is my Dad.

JAMIE	Your Dad? Is this some Oedipal Shit goiní on here?

NOLA	You mean Electra. No. I hope that’s not why I want to see you.

JAMIE	So your Father lets you call him by his First name?

NOLA	Not really. Musicians are Free Spirits. At least theyíre supposed to be. But enough about him. Who are you Mr. Overstreet?

JAMIE	Who am I? I’m a Man who wants to Wake Up with you when the Sun kisses the side of your Face in the morning and the Man who wants to Lay Down with you when the Moon softens the furrow of your Brow as you close your Eyes to Sleep at Night.

NOLA	You think you have me all figured out? But are you ready for me? You think you know me?

JAMIE	No, I donít. But I would Love to.

NOLA	Well Iím a Woman who needs to sell some Damn Paintings.

JAMIE	Slow but Steady Wins The Race...

NOLA	...You sound like Stokely again. I need to win the Race now. I need that Red Dot that says ìSoldî sticker, that Blood on the Walls under my Work. A Hundred Stacks piling northward. 

JAMIE	I feel you and Iíll buy some more Art Work from you...

NOLA	I am not looking for a Handout.

JAMIE	Itís not a Handout if I Love your Work.

JAMIE	Talk to me Nola. Whatís up?

ARLENE	Hey Nola, How you doing?

NOLA	Good, How you doin’ today Arlene?

NOLA	Itís my Gig as a Teaching Artist at Harriet Tubman Middle School in Crown Heights. Kids that have been labeled ìAt Risk.î I mean, I have even had to go into my own Pocket to get Supplies for my Students...

NOLA	...Because Art was Not a priority for these Kids at Tubman...and in all honesty, Harriet Tubman is seriously underfunded by the Board Of Ed.

JAMIE	Horrible. But I Love your Commitment.

NOLA	Thanks. Thing is, I had a Project that I wanted to assign to my Students: I wanted them to create an Album Cover that reflected their Life Story. 

JAMIE	Ok. I like that.

NOLA	What really stood out to me though, was one piece by a young Girl, named Reggie. She recreated Lil Kimís Cover for her Hardcore Album. Reggie painted herself on the Cover in the same provocative pose. Reggie is a gifted Artist but she is only 12-Years-Old.

JAMIE	Life is severe in The Hood.

NOLA	Okay...here you go with your little routine. Really?

JAMIE	You know I donít smoke Cheeba. I mean, yes...I will let you give me a Shotgun.

NOLA	That’the same damn thing, Jamie. And why you always want to call Weed Cheeba? It’s Kush. Trees.

JAMIE	I haven’t rolled an El in over 20 years.

NOLA	Get Da Fuck Outta Here. You expect me to believe Dat Bullshit?

JAMIE	No, straight up. Taking a Shotgun is like I’m Smokin’ but not smokin’.

NOLA	I buy that.

JAMIE	I Love your Passion for Life.

NOLA	You say that like a Man who has been deprived of that.

JAMIE	I take the Fifth, your Honor.

JAMIE	One of the reasons I stopped Smokiní Weed for almost 20 years, is that when I was growiní up, I sparked Trees almost everyday from the age of 15 to 19. I grew up in Howard Projects. Brownsville. Never Ran, Never Will.

NOLA	Wow, I didn’t know that.

JAMIE	Called my building Lilí Beirut...1572 East New York Avenue. It was a War Zone. Dudes gettiní Murked everyday. Over Drugs. Over Money. Over Real Estate they did not own. Stupid Shit. I got High because I was a Private School Kid who went to Dalton on a Scholarship and I had to Fight everyday because Dudes were always tryiní to Test me.

JAMIE	I won those Fights and I won their Respect but I just wanted to fit in. But I was living in Two Worlds...the Elite, mostly White Students in Manhattan and the Fuckiní Brownsville Wolves in Da Hood. The Older Dudes Preyiní on Young Boys to do their bidding. Dudes tryiní to win around World at all costs.

JAMIE	Sorry Baby. Sometimes I feel like a walking Time-Bomb of Un-Detonated memories.

NOLA	What does that mean?

JAMIE	It means my Son Virgil goes to one of the best Prep Schools in the Country. Heights Prep in Brooklyn Heights. The Teachers there never have to come Out-of-Pocket because there is a lack of supplies.Heights Prep is State-Of-the-Art on All Levels. Like a Mini-Harvard or Stanford.

NOLA	I heard that.

JAMIE	I know it sounds like I am Low-Key bragginí about my Son.

NOLA	Youíre not?

JAMIE	No. Not at all. Honestly, I am surprised I am even talkiní to you about dis.

NOLA	Me too.

JAMIE	I just wanted to let you know that I empathize with The Kids in your Class Cuzí that is a World I grew up in and I wonít have let Virgil be a part of that World. And I believe Virgil understands that, too. He is an amazing Student, A-Plus across the board. Me and his Mom are paying the Big Bucks to ensure his place at the Top. Virgil is not caught up in the snare of the Hood.

VIRGIL	ìNiggas For Luv/Bishes Eat Dis Chub/Dum Dum Bullets Stay Dug/ Clap At Dose Snap Caps/Try Hard Niggas Get Dose Wigs Pushed Way Back/Just Like A Cheap Ass Rug...î

JUDITH	Cheryl, your Boy Virgil is so Talented! I have a Friend, who knows a Friend, who has a relative that works for Scooter. Bieberís Guy. 

CHERYL	Are you serious, right now?

JUDITH	My Nigga Virge/He Stay On Point/Like A Toothbrush Shank In Da Joint...

JUDITH	Um...right. Sorry Cheryl. You still up for Lunch with me and Kirk at Walterís my treat...

CHERYL	No Judith. Not today.

JAMIE	Virgil, Iím sorry to brag but this Kid is going to do Big Things in Life. He is a Natural Born Leader. All the Kids look up to him in Heights Prep: White Kids, Hispanic, Asian,too...even the older Students. My Son is a Winner.

NOLA	Youíre not going to answer your Phone?

JAMIE	Nah, itís probably one of my Guys at The Firm, wonderiní just how long is my extended Lunch. Tryiní to Bust my Balls a little bit, yíknow. Theyíll be okay.

NOLA	Is everything okay, Jamie? Whatís going on?

JAMIE	I have a Family Emergency that I have to deal with right now.
 
NOLA	Text me later...if you can.

NOLA	Oh Shit! I gotta go too.

CHERYL	The Sins of The Hood visited to the next Generation, Jamie.

JAMIE	What the Hell does that mean, What are you trying to say, Cheryl?

CHERYL	Iím saying this is your Fault. This is your Hood Rat Genes coming out in My Virgil.

JAMIE	Here You Go Again. This is your Default Position Cheryl...when things go Wrong, Blame Jamie. Right?

CHERYL	I don’t like what’s happening to my Virgil. So yes, that’s how I Feel.

JAMIE	Youíre Virgil? Heís my son too. Thatís the problem, youíre always coddling him. Trying to make him into a Mamaís Boy! Always sending him to Sag Harbor to spend every Summer. I mean, me and your Dad are Cool, weíre post up, but your Mom who Low-Key Hates My Guts.

CHERYL	Stop talking so Ghetto: ìLow Key This, Post Up That.î Youíre not in Projects anymore, so stop Talking so Juvenile. You are a most articulate Man. I hate it when you slip back in to Rachet-Speak. You know why? Because I donít want Virgil talking that way. I donít want my Sun to struggle like you did.

JAMIE	Don’t get it Twisted. I was Born into the Struggle. And so was our Sun.

CHERYL	Whatís that? One of your new Colognes? I donít like it.

JAMIE	Itís called Ocean Wave.

CHERYL	What the Hell does that mean? Are you trying to be Cryptic?

JAMIE	If I was, would you even care? We’re going to be late.

CHERYL	Did any other Parents complain  about the outrageousness of thisMusic Video?

GORDON	The other Parents never called me. You and your Husband were the only ones to take issue with this.

JAMIE	I almost think you donít understand the gravity of this situation Mr. Howard. My Wife and I are not paying this Elite School $45,000 year to see my Son degrade himself with the word Nigger and to see other White and non Black Students use such an Incendiary and Dangerous Epithet so freely.

GORDON	It was an assignment --

JAMIE	An assignment?

GORDON	For their Film/New Media Class. A Former Graduate of Heights who is now an Exec at a Major Studio funded the Lab for a Million Dollars.

GORDON	Although thatís not a term I would use myself, Virgil and his Classmates were given a Class assignment to create something that would go Viral and their Music Video did just that! Their...

GORDON	...N-word for Luv Music Video has racked up more than five-hundred thousand YouTube views.

JAMIE	Let me ask you Mr. Howard.

GORDON	Please, call me Gordon. The other Parents do.

CHERYL	Clearly we are not like the other Parents. The ones who didnít feel this was an Issue.

JAMIE	I wonder if they would have felt it was an Issue if the Song was Titled Kikes For Love? Or Chinks for Love? Or Micks For Love? Or Spics For Love or even Faggots For Love? Would they pivot on their opinion on just how vile this Song is?

CHERYL	Mr. Howard, I was just thinking. I have a former classmate of mine from Yale...and she is White, by the way...who is an esteemed Columnist for the New York Times. I wonder how she would frame a Story about Heights Prepís subtle endorsement of White and Non- African American Students liberal use of the word Nigger in a School project?

GORDON	Mr. and Mrs. Overstreet, you are absolutely White.

GORDON	Iím mean Right, I mean Right. Sorry about that. You are absolutely Right and I fell Asleep at The Wheel here in my duties.

GORDON	I will have the Music Video deleted immediately from YouTube and this kind of insensitivity will not happen again on my Watch. You have my Word.


RAQUELETTA MOSS	What are you doing here, Ms. Darling?

NOLA	What do you mean Ms. Moss? You told me you wanted to have a Meeting with me at 3:30. 

NOLA	And as a matter of fact, I’m Ten Minutes early.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	You are 24 hours and Ten Minutes early, Ms. Darling. Our Meeting was not until tomorrow afternoon at 3:30.

NOLA	May I have a seat?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Be my guest. Look, I know how it is when somebody got you Sprung. Trust me. But that ain’t none-a my B.I. 

NOLA	With all respect Ms. Moss, you’re right. It is none of your Business. 


RAQUELETTA MOSS	I agree. But you know what is my B.I ? These Students and their personal welfare. Thatís Raqueletta Mossís B.I. I care about them. Especially Reggie.

NOLA	Are you saying I don’t care? Because I do, Miss Moss. I care about these Students more than you know.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Ms. Darling, on the contrary. Raqueletta Moss knows that you care. Raqueletta Moss admires your  work and your Love for the Children. But you don’t know thelevel of Trauma...the level of Sexual Trauma some of the Students  have experienced. But I...

RAQUELETTA MOSS	...Excuse me...Raqueletta Moss knows that kind of Trauma. And Raqueletta Moss believes...despite your noble intentions...that using Art to confront Personal Dysfunction is a Self-Fulfilling Defect. A Broken Record that never stops skipping. Ms. Darling, do you mind if Raqueletta Moss shares something personal with you?

NOLA	Ok?RAQUELETTA MOSS	Raqueletta Moss comes from that same environment that Reggie was born in. Raqueletta Moss was one of those Chicken Heads Cluckiní......in the Back Rooms Fuckiní Grown-Ass  Crack Monster Men, when she was just 13 years old. Raqueletta Moss was The Product of a cracked-out Single Mom who Pimped her overdeveloped Daughter in Dark Project Hallways. Raqueletta Moss was shuffled like a deck of Marked Cards in the Foster Care System. Raqueletta Moss Thanks GOD Everyday that she was adopted from a group home by Albert and Tina Lewis, who lived in Canarsie and put Raqueletta Moss on the Straight and Narrow. After Raqueletta Moss graduated with her Masters in Education from L.I.U. on the corner of Dekalb and Flatbush across from Juniorís Raqueletta Moss vowed to help Kids succeed with Love, Compassion and Discipline. Raqueletta Moss wants to help Ms. Darling deepen herempathy for Students like Reggie,  and always realize that Emotional Scars are like Still Waters...they run Deeper Than Deep. Do you understand what Raqueletta Moss...sorry...do you understand what I am trying to say, Ms. Darling?

NOLA	I think I do. Question...do You always speak in the Third Person?

RAQUELETTA MOSS	We all have our ways of coping, Ms. Darling. Have a Good Afternoon.

RAQUELETTA	Raqueletta Moss be watching Ms. Nola Darling.

VIRGIL	Did you and Mom really have to come to the School Dad?

JAMIE	Son, you and I have to have this conversation. Because the World is on Fire right now and that word you were using so carelessly--that word Nigger--itís the Gasoline Igniting The Flames. There is nothing Cool about using that word and especially a young Black Man using it freely around Young White Kids who have no Historical reference.

VIRGIL	Dad when the White and Asian Kids at my School call each other Nigga, We say it because We are Cool with each other. Itís all Love between us. My Generation is different.

JAMIE	...Different like that White boy Dylan Storm Roof in Charleston that walked into Emmanuel AME Church and Murdered Nine Innocent People? Different like him? He used that word, too. But he wasn’t Cool with those Blessed Folks He Murdered. He was a Hater and he used that word Hatefully. That Word is meant to Disarm, Dismiss, and Destroy.

VIRGIL	Dad, I feel you. But you and Mom sent to Heights Prep. And from the moment I walked through the door, no one had to call me a nigger. I got treated like one, and I owned it. But this is something I am going to have to figure out on my own.
 
JAMIE	Youíre right Sun. You have to travel on that Road to Manhood on your own but you still need a Map. Allow me to be your GPS Virgil.

JAMIE	Iíll be right back

VIRGIL	You know who the Dopest Dude I know is?

JAMIE	Who is that?

VIRGIL	Iím looking at him.

JAMIE	I love you Son. And I call you Son...S-U-N...because you shine like one.

VIRGIL	Those Cops Dad, I thought for sure that...I donít know. I thought it was going to be something crazy.

JAMIE	Sorry to say Virgil, but those two Cops are not unique and most Police Officers wear that badge in order to Do The Right Thing. And some donít. I remember when I was your age and me and some of my Boys were playing a game of Twenty One on the courts on Linden and Christopher Avenue in Brownsville. We were Balliní without a care in The World. All of a sudden, this Squad Car rolls up on Linden, and these Three White Cops jump out, Guns in Hand, and Run Up on Us!

VIRGIL	Really? Why Dad?

JAMIE	Why? Because the Sun was Shining and because those Three White Cops could. They made us get Face-Down on the ground, and put the Guns to our Heads, and said, “If one of you Little Niggers make one move, Youse are gettin’ Two to Da Head. One of my Boys, Donnie, Peed in his Pants, he was so scared. And you know what those The Three White Cops did. They LAUGHED and they left us there on the Court.

VIRGIL	You OK, Dad?

JAMIE	The rules are different out here for Young Black Men like you. Tamir Rice. LaQuan McDonald. Trayvon Martin. Jordan Davis. Mike Brown. However, if any of them looked like your Classmates who were in the Music Video with you, would they be alive today? Think about it Sun. Because the Stakes Are High.

JAMIE	Come on. Let’s take a walk.

REGGIE	This Work is so Dope. I Love it.

NOLA	You have real Talent, Reggie. I mean it, you have that ability to take your Inner Voice and blast it on speaker phone through your Images. Your Art.

NOLA	You know Reggie, the Terminology of the words Bitch, Slut, and Ho...as Cool as it may seem that you can repurpose it to empower you...it doesnít actually increase your Currency in the World. If youíre not careful, it can actually...

REGGIE	I know what youíre going to say...it can actually cheapen my own personal value. Thatís if I let it. But Ms. Darling, donít you know that I  know that Nicki Minaj, and Amber Rose are playing a Role? Iím not Stoopid. Men call them Sluts, Hoís, every Dirty thing you can name but Nicki and Amber have damn near 75 million Followers on Instagram combined. Being a Ho can be Great Business.

NOLA	Reggie, do you understand what you are saying?

REGGIE	Yeah I understand...this is America. They Stacks and Platforms. Now that’s ho you build an Empire. I’m saying that Nikki and Amber feel that actin’ like Ho’s makes them Stacks Grow. That’s what works for them. I’m not saying that works for me.

REGGIE	Thank you for the Books Ms. Darling. See you in Class next week.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Dear Ms. Nola Darling... I want to give you a chance Sista, as I Feel You have a real purpose. Letís work together to Serve these Students. As my Personal Role Model, and The First African-American Woman elected to Congress and the First African-American Woman to run for President of The United States of  America, the Late Great Shirley Chisholm once said, ìService is the Rent you pay for room on this Earth.î

NOLA	(And By the) By, Raqueletta Moss speaks in the third person, because she survived her personal Holocaust by stepping out of her Body and saying, ìI am not hereî, I am not here. You canít hurt me, because Raqueletta Moss is not here.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	To quote one of Brooklynís Finest, The Late Notorious B.I.G., ìAnd if you donít know, now you knowÖî Donít let me down, my Sister.î Sincerely, Ms. Raqueletta Moss.î
