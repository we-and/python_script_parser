RUPAUL	Previously on "RuPaul's Drag Race"... We're having a Book Ball.

NAOMI SMALLS	Ooh.

NAOMI SMALLS	Am I the first person who's ever said anything like this, ever, to you?

DERRICK BARRY	That has said my makeup is not good?

NAOMI SMALLS	I didn't say your makeup's not good. It's just not drag.

KIM CHI	When's dinner?

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

MICHELLE	I am not getting "book" at all. I'm getting "cardboard."

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, I'm still wearing books. I'm just not wearing pages.

MICHELLE	Okay.

RUPAUL	Derrick Barry.

ROSS	I don't know that you're at this level.

MICHELLE	I have seen what you've done with your eyebrows, but it's going to be a journey.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi.

AMY	I felt something from each look and couldn't wait for you to come out.

MICHELLE	It was the artistry I expect from you.

RUPAUL	You are the winner of this week's challenge.

KIM CHI	Thank you, thank you, thank you.

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen, shantay, you stay. Derrick Barry, sashay away.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Derrick!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughing) Ooh, my goodness.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	All right, girl.

KIM CHI	Oh, my God, Derrick's message is actually surprisingly short.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	She's a champ. I like her a lot. I didn't think I would like her, and I ended up really liking her.

KIM CHI	Yeah, me too.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I did too.

KIM CHI	Long live Britney.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I got to say, being in the bottom two is an experience.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Mm.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Bottom two, not a cute look. I feel like there's a dent in my armor now, but it's time to pick myself up by my wig straps and get back in the game.

NAOMI SMALLS	Congratulations, Kim.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Congratulations.

KIM CHI	Thank you. I finally won! I feel really good about how well I've done, but I can't be too secure, because people who won the challenge the week before have gone home, so no one is safe.

NAOMI SMALLS	The judges told me I have to work on being ugly, and I don't think I know how to do that.

KIM CHI	Can you make an ugly face right now for us?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Can you smudge your makeup? Like, just rub your hand across your...

NAOMI SMALLS	Okay, ready?

KIM CHI	Take the lashes off first.
NAOMI SMALLS	That's too far.

KIM CHI	See?

BOB THE DRAG QUEENHere I come. (exclaiming)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Wait a minute now.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	There you go. Be ugly, G.

KIM CHI	Top freakin'...

CHI CHI DEVAYNE AND KIM CHI	Four.

NAOMI SMALLS	You know how close we are?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Mad close.

NAOMI SMALLS	Major. So now that it's the top four, the stakes are [bleep] high. Yes, we're all friends, but unfortunately, someone has to go home. This is a competition, and I want to be in the top three.

NAOMI SMALLS	Bring it on.

RUPAUL	The winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race" receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $,.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

KIM CHI	Top four.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yes. It's the final challenge, and Ru told us to show up in full face and be ready to hit the ground running.

RUPAUL	Surprise, my top four.

KIM CHI	God.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh.

RUPAUL	I didn't know you bitches woke up like this.

RUPAUL	I want you to meet director Jayson Whitmore.

JAYSON	Hello, ladies.

KIM CHI	Hi, Jayson.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Hey, Jayson.

RUPAUL	Now, Jayson has worked with some of the best drag queens in the world, like Alaska, Adore Delano, Kim Kardashian...

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughs)

RUPAUL	And now it's your turn. For your final Maxi Challenge, you'll star in the official music video for "The Realness."

NAOMI SMALLS	Yes.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm a video ho. Goals. (laughing)

NAOMI SMALLS	When it comes to a music video, it's not Kim Chi's forte. I really hope that she can rise to the challenge. To not make it into the top three with Kim--it would just suck.

RUPAUL	Now, Jayson's vision includes color, fashion, mirrors, smoke, drama. Well, basically, just a day in your normal life.

JAYSON	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Y'all need to serve some #TopRealness, because the queen who gets eliminated tomorrow will be edited out of the final video forever. Yes, forever.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Churl... I want to be in the top three. You can't be America's next drag superstar if you're not in the video.

RUPAUL	So, Jayson, I leave my girls' charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent in your capable hands.

JAYSON	Just keep in mind, we don't have a whole lot of time, so we need to get through our takes really quick, okay?

NAOMI SMALLS	Mm-hmm.
RUPAUL	Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win. All right.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's so important to do well in this challenge, because this is going to be the determining factor if you're going to be America's next drag superstar.

NAOMI SMALLS	Hi. So now it's time to shoot our first video segment with Jayson. I love being in front of the camera, so I'm super excited for our music video.

JAYSON	Ladies, welcome to set. This setup is going to be all about float-ography. You guys are required to serve up a tight lip sync while you appear like you're floating on air. You're gonna be playing to the overhead camera while you're lying on your backs. Up first, Naomi Smalls. I'm looking for the queens to feel light and airy. They have to pay attention to the fabric and looking really, really beautiful while they're floating back into space. Float-ography. Action.

JAYSON	You're falling into this whole fantasy world that Ru is taking you to. Give me those legs. Oh, beautiful. I want those nice, beautiful, gorgeous long legs. Cut, cut, cut. Naomi, we want to really watch those legs, okay?

NAOMI SMALLS	Okay, so, like, out like this, straight?

JAYSON	Yeah, but we don't want it to look like you're a board, so use your abs so it's more like this, right?

NAOMI SMALLS	Okay.

JAYSON	So it's pretty, okay?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Uh-oh, she got to work out.

NAOMI SMALLS	(exhales) I'm starting to freak out, because my ridiculously long legs aren't floating, and I can barely hold myself up. Manual labor is not my thing. (laughs)

JAYSON	And action.

JAYSON	Yeah, that pose is perfect. Keep that pose. Yes, love that.

JAYSON	All right, and cut. Great job, Naomi. It's awesome.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thanks.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(grunts)

JAYSON	Bob, just remember you're floating in air.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I am, like, dangling off this thing.

JAYSON	And action.	

JAYSON	Don't put your legs like that. It's not pretty.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Okay. Ooh. This [bleep] is not easy. I am [bleep] sweating. I'm going from looking like Viola Davis to looking like Patrick Ewing. This [bleep] is not cute.

JAYSON	Ooh. Chi Chi, remember, you're top four. Lot of energy, face.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Mm-hmm.

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughing)

JAYSON	And action.

JAYSON	Gorgeous. Beautiful. You're falling into the world, yes. I love that.

JAYSON	Your legs look stunning. Love 'em.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Chi Chi is doing great. I was like, "[bleep] you, you [bleep] fit prison trade bitch."

JAYSON	All right, so, Kim Chi, you better turnt it out.

KIM CHI	The hardest part about this challenge is definitely moving, period.

JAYSON	Action.

JAYSON	Make sure you look towards the camera, love.

JAYSON	Find the camera, girl.

JAYSON	All right, cut. Hey, Kim Chi?

KIM CHI	Yes?

JAYSON	I'm getting a lot of chin, and I'm not getting a lot of face, and I really would love it to be, like, very graceful, like you're falling into this whole other world.

KIM CHI	Okay.

JAYSON	And action.

JAYSON	Give me surprise. Give me grace.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Kim Chi looks like a [bleep] upside-down turtle. Help. (chuckling) Help.

JAYSON	Watch those legs.

KIM CHI	I'm trying to give good face.

JAYSON	Keep the legs moving.

KIM CHI	But as the clock ticks on, it just gets harder and harder to keep my legs up.

JAYSON	There you go.

KIM CHI	What--oh, [bleep].

KIM CHI	Oh, [bleep].

JAYSON	Whoa, is she okay?

NAOMI SMALLS	Are you okay?

KIM CHI	Yeah.

JAYSON	Drag queen down.

KIM CHI	I'm fine. I'm fine.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Classic Kim Chi. She's fallen more than anyone in "Drag Race" history. (laughs) Sorry.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh, my goodness. Poor Kim Chi. I don't know, girl. Your makeup might not save you on this one.

JAYSON	All right, that's a wrap on the float-ography. Quick change, and I'll meet you guys back here on the set.

RUPAUL	Coming up...

JAYSON	Okay, cut, cut, cut. Let's untangle Chi Chi from her gown. Chi Chi, have you danced in gowns before?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	No.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Child.

JAYSON	Well, we better learn quick.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	[bleep].

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

NAOMI SMALLS	Hi.

JAYSON	Wow, welcome. Look at you.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's time for our second take of the video, and it's avant-garde. I have no idea what avant-garde is, but I'ma do my damnedest.

JAYSON	This is actually going to be all about you performing. Avant-garde for the music video is all about self-expression, movement, face, and art. And action.

JAYSON	More energy.

JAYSON	Okay, cut. Bob, you're at a five. I want you at a ten. Can you give me a little bit more comedy, please?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Okay.
JAYSON	Yes, love that.

JAYSON	(chuckling) Work it.

JAYSON	Yes. You did it, girl. (laughing) Yeah! That was great. All right, Kim Chi, you're up.

NAOMI SMALLS	She's so cute.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Kim Chi's avant-garde look is like Colonel Sanders is about to cut her head off and pluck and fry her ass. She look like a spring chicken.
JAYSON	And action.

JAYSON	Yes.

JAYSON	Ooh, I love that. With attitude for days, please.

JAYSON	Yes.

JAYSON	Beautiful. All right, Naomi. And action.

JAYSON	Yes, mama, work it.

NAOMI SMALLS	Whoo, sorry.

JAYSON	Okay, cut, cut, cut. Let's do that again, girl.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Come on, Kim Chi. (laughs)

KIM CHI	Who can't walk in heels now, bitch?

JAYSON	Action.

JAYSON	Yes.

JAYSON	Oh, give me those legs for days, girl.

KIM CHI	Naomi's very mesmerizing to watch. Like, every pose she strikes is very perfect.

JAYSON	Yes.

JAYSON	Paris is burning right now.

JAYSON	Whoo. Give me Ru fever glam. Now, that is how you do it. All right, Chi Chi, you're up next. And action.

JAYSON	Yes.

JAYSON	Little bit more dance. Yeah, love it.

NAOMI SMALLS	Yes, bitch.

JAYSON	Okay, cut, cut, cut. Let's untangle Chi Chi from her gown.

JAYSON	Chi Chi?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Mm-hmm?

JAYSON	Have you danced in gowns before?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	No.

JAYSON	Okay, well, we better learn quick.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Okay.

JAYSON	And action. Bam.

JAYSON	Bam.

JAYSON	Ah.

JAYSON	Give me fierce, fierce avant-garde. And pose.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Pull your dress up. Pull your dress up. Pull your dress up.

JAYSON	All right, let's cut. Let's cut, cut, cut, cut. We got a wardrobe malfunction again.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Again? [bleep]. Like, I am the dancing diva of "Drag Race," and this frickin' gown--it's pissing me off.
JAYSON	Okay, cut. Ladies, we have one more setup. Go get changed, and I'll see you in a few.

JAYSON	Bob, this is a scene with your biggest competitor: you and the mirror. And action.

JAYSON	We're loving that.

JAYSON	Serving glamour. Give me fierce. (laughs) Yes.

KIM CHI	Bob's glamour look is really interesting. His right hand looks like he fisted a coal mine, and his left hand looks like he fisted a gold mine.

JAYSON	Yes, work it. Glamour.

JAYSON	Fierce.

JAYSON	Ooh, that's cool. Then you see something in the mirror. (chuckling)

JAYSON	Gorg. Loving it. We're feeling you. And pose.

JAYSON	Perfect. And cut. Okay, we got it. That's a wrap, guys. That's a wrap.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	What's done is done. Now it's up to Ru. Judge, jury, and executioner.

JAYSON	All right, that's a wrap on "The Realness," ladies. It was incredible.

BIANCA DEL RIO	Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, God.

BIANCA DEL RIO	Coming through. Perhaps you can help me.

JAYSON	Okay.

BIANCA DEL RIO	I'm here for the photo shoot, the past winners' photo shoot.

BIANCA DEL RIO	Oh, [bleep], Tyra, you look horrible.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughing)

BIANCA DEL RIO	And Jinkx got a tan. And you must be that sweet thing that won season seven, right? Whatever--oh, [bleep]. This is season eight. Bye. Sorry. Excuse me.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	What the [bleep]?

KIM CHI	(laughs)

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Damn, bitch, you about ten episodes late. Where the [bleep] you been?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Is there no security on the goddamn lot?


BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It's the last day of school.

KIM CHI	Ah!

KIM CHI	Sign my yearbook, everyone.

NAOMI SMALLS	It's our final day in the workroom, and it feels like it's our last day of school, and we're finding out who's gonna get valedictorian or something.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	What do each of you think you've learned about yourself throughout the competition?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I've learned that apparently, I can come off as very arrogant, but I attribute it to confidence. I've not always been this confident. I was like a little chunky kid. I was really effeminate. I had really dark skin, and kids can be mean to you, so once I found out what I was good at and I really embraced it, people started to like me. Find something about you that you like, and focus on that. If I don't like my face, if I don't like my skin, if I don't like my weight, but I think to myself, "I have nice teeth," and it may just start with one tooth. "Look at that tooth. That's a nice tooth, man." And then once you can accept that little thing about yourself, you can just accept you for who you are.

KIM CHI	I've learned that I can't walk in heels, I can't dance, and I have a lisp.

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs)

KIM CHI	To be honest, you could be overweight, you could have a lisp, you could have jacked-up teeth, but you, too, can turn it around. You know, people just, like, like me for who I am and I shouldn't try to be anybody else.

NAOMI SMALLS	First impression of Kim Chi, I thought she was, um, very talented, 'cause I already knew of Kim Chi before I got here, so I was, like, already impressed with her, and...

KIM CHI	And then all that changed.

NAOMI SMALLS	No, but, like, Kim is amazing.

KIM CHI	Aww, you're amazing.

NAOMI SMALLS	I was a huge fan of Kim Chi before I came here, and now she's one of my best friends here. She's, like, a big, lovable panda. I really don't know another way to explain it.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	DeVayne.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I, um--I didn't realize how much I hated where I was from and how I talk. I never, ever thought I was funny. Like, I never realized all of that until I got here.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That's why I think you've grown the most, honestly.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	This is why.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	My journey in this competition has been up and down. Making the top three would be a dream come true. This means a whole lot to me.

NAOMI SMALLS	I need to stop comparing myself to others and just appreciate what I have, because what I have is amazing, and I just need to own it. I don't need to be doing death drops and stand-up comedy.

KIM CHI	But you know who does death drops? Bob.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Known for her death drops.

NAOMI SMALLS	I really did find myself here. That's, like, the best prize, and I'm so proud of myself.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	And probably all of y'all--I do not want to go home.

KIM CHI	I do not want to go home, either.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I just hate the [bleep] food in California. It's gross. Whole Food and bull[bleep].

KIM CHI	It's so good.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Kim, you like all the food in the world.

KIM CHI	I mean...

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN 	All of the food of the world.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(laughing)

KIM CHI 	All of the food in all of the-- People are going, oh, remember your egg rolls?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	While y'all talking about me eating turkey necks, this bitch Kim Chi says she eats fried chicken buttholes.

KIM CHI	It's good.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm kind of grossed out.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yeah, that's gross, now.

KIM CHI	You [bleep] people's butthole. Why is chicken any different?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Touché, Kimberly. Touché. And those mother[bleep] are undercooked!

RUPAUL	Coming up...

CARSON	I'm so happy to see you here, because I think you bring something really special and unique.

ROSS	You put in the work.

MICHELLE	If I had moisture left in my body, I'd probably shed a tear tonight.

RUPAUL AND MICHELLE	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing)

ROSS	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "RuPaul's Drag Race." Tonight, it's just family. This week, we challenged our top four queens to star in the official music video of my song "The Realness," and tonight, they're ready to make us gag, decked out in their very best drag. Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.

RUPAUL	Up first, Bob The Drag Queen. Not to be confused with Bob the barista. No foam.

ROSS	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	This is it. This is the final runway, so I wanted to wear a tuxedo and do a feminine version of it, so I'm wearing this crazy, sequined jacket. This is quintessential Bob The Drag Queen.

RUPAUL	Tell me about it, stud.

RUPAUL	Mrs. PG. Pass it on.

ROSS	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

CARSON	Miss DeVayne, if you're nasty.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh. Serving opulence.

MICHELLE	She owns everything.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I'm going full-on pageant. I have big buns on my head. To me, it just screams "best drag." I'm trying to show the judges that I've gotten over all of these obstacles that I have gone through, and I am worthy of this.

RUPAUL	Oh, which way are you going?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(mouthing) That way.

RUPAUL	Oh, that way.

CARSON	Apparently, she goes both ways.

RUPAUL	Oh!

ROSS	(laughs) Kisses.

CARSON	Mm. If you like it, then you should've put a bun on it.

RUPAUL	Okay, are you ready for Kim Chi?

MICHELLE	I'm hungry.

CARSON	Magnificent Maleficent.

MICHELLE	That's a cock-a-doodle-doo.

KIM CHI	I'm wearing a feather corset covered in goose and pheasant feathers, and I'm feeling like a dark, evil princess who came here to destroy my competition.

RUPAUL	She's working that walk, Michelle.

MICHELLE	She is.

ROSS	Mm-hmm.

MICHELLE	Only took till the finale.

CARSON	Well, kimchi gets better with a little time.

RUPAUL	It does; it's--actually, usually the next day, it tastes a lot better.

CARSON	Yeah. Mm-hmm.

ROSS	(laughing)

RUPAUL	"The Raven," Edgar Allan Ho.

MICHELLE	Ha-ha-ha!

RUPAUL	Are you ready for Naomi Smalls?

MICHELLE	Ooh, dark lady.

CARSON	The notorious Twiggy Smalls.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

ROSS	Yes.

RUPAUL	Well, she's also serving a little Kendall Jenner.

CARSON	She is, yeah.

NAOMI SMALLS	I am showing the judges that I'm not relying on sequins and rhinestones to zhuzh up my outfit. This is Naomi Smalls glamour to a T. I refuse to blend in. I want to be the star.

RUPAUL	The beat goes on, and so do those legs.

CARSON	Thanks for "Chering."

RUPAUL	(as Cher) Yes, gypsies, tramps, and weaves.

RUPAUL	Ladies, here at "RuPaul's Drag Race," we have the luxury of celebrating who we are, but we must never forget that even today, there are little boys and girls who feel they don't fit in. So I want you to turn back time and share the wisdom you have today with the child you were then. So Bob The Drag Queen...

CARSON	Aww.

RUPAUL	This is you...

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That is me.

RUPAUL	At four years old.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah.

RUPAUL	What do you have to say to little Christopher?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I say, "Hey, girl." (laughing) I would tell myself, "You're gonna want to change for others. Do not do that." I just wanted to be like my brother or like my uncles. I was so different than every other guy in my family. I just wanted to blend in and be like them, but once I realized how important it really is to be me, then I really shone through. And I would also say, "Don't take out that student loan freshman year of college."

RUPAUL	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	"Just pay out of pocket like you did the rest of it," because it's still haunting me to this day.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Bob. All right, Chi Chi DeVayne, this is you at six years old. What do you have to say to little Zavion?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I would tell little Zavion Davenport that "it doesn't matter where you're from and how you grew up, the neighborhood you grew up in. That has nothing to do with how far you can go. Never be ashamed of how you walk, talk, because that is going to be the key to your success."

RUPAUL	Very sweet. Thank you, Chi Chi.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi, this is you at three years old.

MICHELLE	Aww.

RUPAUL	What do you have to say to little Sang?

KIM CHI	"Hi, Sang. When you grow up, you're going to experience a lot of different cultures. People might shame you for being too different and not fitting in with the rest of the culture. At times, you're gonna feel like you're trapped in the wrong body, and you're trapped in a place where you feel like you can't get out, and you--at times, you're gonna want to think about harming yourself or even running away. But I just wanted to let you know that it will all get better, and once you grow up, the things that you are ashamed of are going to be the truth that other people love you for. And"...

NAOMI SMALLS	It's all right, baby.


KIM CHI	"And you're gonna be able to embrace them. You're gonna find a group of friends who's gonna love you. You're not going to feel lonely anymore, and what you thought was all just a dream will come true for you, because life will get better." (crying)

RUPAUL	Lovely. Kim Chi, you didn't just get better. You got fierce.

KIM CHI	"Oh, and go to a dancing class as soon as possible."

MICHELLE	Ha-ha!

KIM CHI	"You will really regret it if you don't."

RUPAUL	All right, Naomi Smalls. This is you at seven.

MICHELLE	Aww.

RUPAUL	What do you have to say to little Davis?

NAOMI SMALLS	"Davis, um, you're gonna go through a really confusing time, where people are gonna make fun of your mannerisms and the way that you look, but I just want you to know that you need to [bleep] embrace it, because that's what makes you special. Be proud that you're not like all the other boys, and just do what you do best, and that's just being you, 'cause that's what people are gonna love you for." (chuckles)

RUPAUL	Thank you, Naomi. Condragulations, ladies. Each of you made it to the top four the old-fashioned way. You mother-tucking earned it, but in very different ways. Now it's time for the judges' critiques.

RUPAUL	Coming up... These kids have come a long way, but somebody has to go home tonight.

CARSON	Really?

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing) Ladies, now it's time for the judges' critiques. First up, Bob The Drag Queen.

MICHELLE	You can really dance.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

MICHELLE	You come to life when you use dance moves.

CARSON	And you had such great elegance and length to your body. You made it look fabulous, and I was like, "Wow, Bob The Drag Queen is giving us some glamour."

MICHELLE	Tonight, on the runway, because we've seen leggings a lot from you, I wish it would have just gone that extra notch to do a gown.

ROSS	I was sort of torn on the leggings, which, by the way, is what I would do to those leggings if I tried to put 'em on.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(laughs)

ROSS	But I think this is a really good place for your drag. Let's talk about your journey. You've managed to do a really good job of standing out. You have managed to be hilarious throughout, and you've also listened to the judges and grown. I see an evolution with you.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Bob.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne. Ooh, girl, you've come a long way from Shreveport, Louisiana.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I heard that.

MICHELLE	Tonight, is it the most creative thing we've ever seen on the main stage? No. But you look stunning, and I love the pageant hair. It's one of my favorite things in the world, is that pageant hair with the  buns on top.

CARSON	The music video, very nice job. That was, like, your moment where you were living, 'cause you were, like, in the mirror, and you were all done up, and it was just you being you. The wind scene, you looked gorgeous in that.

MICHELLE	Because you dance, you had the fluidity, and you knew just what to do on that black box.

CARSON	I have to talk about some of your journey. Um, your taste level was, um, uh, questionable.

ROSS	Am I surprised that you're here? Yes, if I had a time machine and came here now, I would be shocked, but you put in the work, and I love a surprise ending. You're like the M. Night Shyama-lama-lan of drag queens, right? I didn't see this coming.

MICHELLE	Our little girl has grown up. Chi Chi, if I had moisture left in my body, I'd probably shed a tear tonight.

MICHELLE	But I dried up years ago.

RUPAUL	Yes, everybody knows it. Thank you, Chi Chi. Up next, Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	Even though we fought this awkward body movement thing this whole season, I think you've really gotten to a place where you can work it now.

CARSON	For avant-garde, you were like a glamorous, Dame-Edna-inspired chicken.

KIM CHI	(laughs)

CARSON	It was so captivating.

ROSS	And seeing your journey of self-acceptance and your journey to challenge yourself has been really impressive.

MICHELLE	As a matter of fact, in your entire journey, I don't think there was one look that you didn't kill, and tonight is just the cherry on top of the hot fudge sundae. Thank you for bringing your artistry to the main stage of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

RUPAUL	Up next, Naomi Smalls.

MICHELLE	You look absolutely beautiful tonight. Of course, it's iconic Cher for us, so it makes us super happy.

RUPAUL	(as Cher) Snap out of it.

MICHELLE	You have brought it, and this music video was no exception.

CARSON	For avant-garde, I want you to look like an alien, and that blue look with the white boots gave that to me.

MICHELLE	And what I love most about you is, you're so sweet.

CARSON	You're that great combination of, like, you're a fierce bitch that could cut a bitch on the street, but you're also, like, a sweet little, like, kitten. I'm so happy to see you here, because I think you bring something really special and unique. You listened, you worked, and it paid off.

ROSS	We all have those moments when you decide to, like, bust through. I can think of times in my career--it was hearing "No"--when I just said, "[bleep] y'all. I'm in," and there was just a moment here when you just said, "I am in."

MICHELLE	Naomi, to say that you are the surprise...it's no exaggeration. It's just as surprising as Chi Chi for me. This is not the final four that I would have predicted the first week in the competition, and you did it, and you earned it.

RUPAUL	I want to say this to all the girls. The theme of the winner's circle is adaptability, but at the same time staying true to your own unique frequency, and that's the truth not only in this competition but in everything in life. Taking those cues from the universe and applying them but without losing who you are, and each of you represent that, and I am so proud of each of you, and that is why you're standing on this stage today.

RUPAUL	Coming up... Ladies, there's just one more thing. Why should you, and not your competitors, be crowned America's next drag superstar?

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing) All right, ladies. Final question. Why should you, and not your competitors, be crowned America's next drag superstar?

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I have, statistically, done the best in this competition, and you reward the person who has done the best with the highest reward. I don't just do what I do for me. I literally do it for anyone who can come within range of my obnoxious, raspy voice.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I serve the people. I serve the community, and more than just doing stand-up comedy, and actually getting my hands and feet into the dirt of the community and helping it grow, because the community has helped me grow, and it's made me who I am today.

RUPAUL	Thank you. All right, Chi Chi DeVayne.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I should be America's next drag superstar because I feel like, um, I possess the talent, the willingness to grow, the--the willingness to take your critiques and apply 'em. I can be funny just as well. I can make costumes, and I can beat this mug out too. I can work a runway. I can work a music video, and I've just blossomed, and I feel like--that I should be America's next drag superstar, because I've shown the most growth out of--out of all of these girls.

RUPAUL	Thank you. All right, next. Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	Throughout this whole competition, I have shown consistent and creative and detailed looks. I have been professional and courteous throughout this whole experience. I have been willing to adapt to myself in any situation I am in. None of the girls will ever come up with the stuff that I do. I don't want to be America's next drag superstar. I am America's next drag superstar.

RUPAUL	Thank you.

KIM CHI	Thank you.

RUPAUL	All right, Naomi Smalls.

NAOMI SMALLS	I love drag so much. It is what, like, gets me up in the morning, and I have such a need and a want to grow, and I don't like to pigeonhole myself into just being either a stand-up comedian or a dancing queen or a look queen. I want to be able to do anything and show everybody that I can be successful just being me and loving who I am, and that is everything I want in the world.

RUPAUL	Thank you.

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Well, my queens, I think we've heard enough. While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.

RUPAUL	Now, just between us squirrel friends, what do you think? Now, y'all were doing a lot of praising up there, and these kids have come a long way. I understand that, but I need y'all to get real for the realness. You know what I'm saying?

ROSS	I can get real.

MICHELLE	I'll break it down.

RUPAUL	You know?

CARSON	(chuckles)

RUPAUL	'Cause, hey, this is still a competition, and somebody has to go home tonight. Bob The Drag Queen.

MICHELLE	Spandex leggings--not so much for best drag. I would have loved to have seen a gown.

CARSON	The makeup has always been not great.

RUPAUL	Right.

ROSS	There was some growth with the looks, but, you know, if I'm buying a ticket to Bob's show, it's not to see glamour. It's to be entertained.

CARSON	She's been consistently smart with her humor. The Snatch Game was stellar.

RUPAUL	Oh.

CARSON	I also liked the shady politics ad. I thought that was really funny.

MICHELLE	I think my number one Bob moment was "chocolate chip cookie." Shut it down in the acting.

RUPAUL	Really every challenge, Bob rose to the occasion and was able to inject Bob The Drag Queen into that challenge. Chi Chi DeVayne.

MICHELLE	Look at how far she's come.

CARSON	She had to lip-synch for her life twice, and she not only saved herself; she, like, killed it. Like, we had a "come to Jesus" meeting during "I'm Telling You I'm Not Going."

RUPAUL	(laughing) The Bitch Perfect challenge. That was a high point.

MICHELLE	She was upside down, lip-syncing...

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.
MICHELLE	Twerking.

RUPAUL	Yes.

MICHELLE	I mean, come on. Also, the Book Ball was a shining, glorious moment for Chi Chi DeVayne.

ROSS	As great as she looked, looking at the four queens on that stage today, I didn't know if she's as original as the other ones, you know? Chi Chi I've seen done before.

RUPAUL	Mm-hmm.

ROSS	But I'm in love with Chi Chi.

CARSON	Right.

ROSS	As a judge, I don't know what to do with that.

RUPAUL	She is one of the kids who come from the sort of backwoods of drag. She doesn't have to do the outfits that people in big cities come to expect, but in this competition, judges wanted to see more, and she delivered more. Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	She can definitely serve a look better than nobody's business. I loved the Wonderful Wizard of Oz Challenge.

RUPAUL	Yeah.

MICHELLE	And what she did with the stripes, with the little woman, I thought it was really, really smart.

CARSON	When she did the Book Ball and created the paper wig out of pink pieces of paper, it's phenomenal.

ROSS	My favorite moment with Kim Chi was the first time I saw her, and I thought, "What in the hell am I looking at?"

MICHELLE	The interesting thing for me was watching the struggle of not loving who she is in her skin.

CARSON	I kind of went through a very similar thing when I did "Queer Eye." It was like that thing that I was hiding. It was like, "Oh, my God, you're the queer guy?" Then it was, like, celebrated, and you're like, "Wait a minute." I think that's gonna happen with her owning it and saying, "Wait, I'm being celebrated for who I am, lisp and awkwardness," and she will get there, but does she have the ability to command a stage and work a crowd and--I don't know.

ROSS	She has the capability to change drag a little.

RUPAUL	Mm-hmm.

ROSS	You know what I mean?

RUPAUL	Yes.

ROSS	To really sort of shift it in a very new, -something...

RUPAUL	Yes.

ROSS	Sort of way, and I'm curious to see where it goes.

RUPAUL	All right, let's move on to Naomi Smalls.

MICHELLE	She has upped her game, and she has brought it to us on a different level.

ROSS	The Wizard of Oz moment was such a game changer.

CARSON	Yes.

MICHELLE	My God. That was really the turning point for her. I mean, haute couture.

RUPAUL	Yeah.

MICHELLE	High-end fashion.

RUPAUL	Now, in the video, I really loved her avant-garde look.

MICHELLE	Mm-hmm.

RUPAUL	I love that she knows her brand.

CARSON	I think the turning point for me was in the black-and-white movie runway look, and she did that beautiful gray makeup.

ROSS	And then out she comes in the Book Ball in that paper dress, which was straight off of a runway somewhere. Her POV became OMG...

RUPAUL, MICHELLE, AND CARSON	(laughing)

ROSS	For me. LOL.

CARSON	She's one that in a year or two will be killing it, but I think she's just not there yet.

MICHELLE	I don't believe that at all.

CARSON	Really?

MICHELLE	We can all get better.

CARSON	But compared to the other girls at this point in time, I don't think she's there yet.

MICHELLE	I do. Her drag is really good and polished.

ROSS	And she's fashion. She's posing, which gives me the chills every time she does that thing that I wish I could do, but my belly gets in the way.

ROSS	I--guess what I'm about to say? I agree with Michelle.

MICHELLE	(exclaims)

CARSON	What?

ROSS	I know, I know. I know, but I--I think what she did this season is worthy of being in the top three and maybe even taking the crown.

RUPAUL	Well, I've just got to say for the room, you know, you guys have been no help whatsoever.

RUPAUL	Silence! I've made my decision. Bring back my girlssssssss...

RUPAUL	(laughing)

RUPAUL	(laughing) Ladies, before I can decide who makes it to the top three, there's just one more thing. This is your last chance to impress me and save yourself...from elimination.

RUPAUL	The time has come...

RUPAUL	For you to lip-synch...

RUPAUL	For your life.

RUPAUL	Good luck, and don't [bleep] it up.

SINGER 	If real is what you feel, feelings aren't real. Put your money down. Place your bet and spin the wheel. If real is what you feel, feelings aren't real. Put your money down. Place your bet and spin the wheel.

SINGER 	The realness.

SINGER 	Gonna move into the house.

NAOMI SMALLS	Drag is about pushing boundaries and pushing yourself. This is what I love doing, and I just want to do this for the rest of my life. I should go forward into the top three because I'm a performer. I'm a supermodel. I'm a [bleep] drag queen.

SINGER 	Feel it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I am the dancing queen of this season, and I have that country swing. I can act. I can do comedy. I'm ready for it. I am America's next drag superstar.

SINGER 	Catch it, flavor of this fever. I know what I feel.

KIM CHI	Making it into the top three would mean the world to me, because I am proving to myself, to the world, and my mother that all the work and all the crazy stuff I've been doing for all these years has not been a waste. I have never, ever wanted anything more. I want this so bad it hurts.

SINGER	Put your money down. Put your money down.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I am living my dream! I actually got into drag because of "Drag Race." I'm a "Drag Race" baby boom. Right after season one, I started doing drag, so this is important. I came here to show America why I think I'm one of the best drag queens in the land. I need to make top three. Like, I have to.

SINGER 	Is it real? The realness. My love is real. The, the realness. The realness.

KIM CHI	Oh, my God.



BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	God.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Yay.

KIM CHI	It's the last day of school.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah.

RUPAUL	Ladies, I've made my decision.

RUPAUL	Chi Chi DeVayne. I'm sorry, my dear, but you will not be moving on to the top three.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	(sighs)

RUPAUL	Chi Chi, you used your Louisiana glamour to charm the world. Take what you've learned here and let them have it.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I just want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart. Not only have you guys taught me how to be a better entertainer, but you have taught me how to be a better person, and $, cannot buy that.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Chi Chi. Now, sashay away.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	It's a knife in the heart, the back, the ass. It's a hurting feeling, to know that you've put your all and...it didn't pay off. I've learned how to love me, my country accent, so I'm happy, but I'm sad at the same time that I didn't win the crown.

RUPAUL	All right, world. Meet your top three queens. Who do you think should be America's next drag superstar? Are you #TeamBob, #TeamKimChi, or #TeamNaomi? I want to hear from you. Sound off across all social media, @RuPaulsDragRace, #DragRace. Tweet it. Comment on Facebook. Blow up Instagram. Call your mother. Hire a skywriter. Leave a lipstick message in the restroom at work. I don't care, just do it now, and tune in two weeks from tonight to watch the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race," where I will crown a winner. Can I get a amen up in here?

ALL	Amen.

RUPAUL	All right, now, let the music play.
