NOELLE	Oh.

ALLISON	It must be December fifth.

NOELLE	Mmhmm. Grandma is right on time. 

ALLISON	Oh my god. I love when you get into your design modes. Your Santa's workshop theme last year blew my mind.

NOELLE	(gasping) Huh! 

NOELLE	Merry Christmas, Grandma!

ALLISON	Uh. Remind me what filling shoes with candies has to do with Christmas.

NOELLE	Well it is a Dutch tradition. Saint Nicolas Eve, children put their shoes by the fireplace for Sinterclause to fill with candies and presents.

ALLISON	So…like a knock off Santa?

NOELLE	Whoa. Sinterclause was Santa before Santa went mainstream. Okay?

ALLISON	Oh! Sorry! I didn't know you were a Christmas hipster.

JOELLE	No, grandma - she is the Christmas hipster. She just - she likes tradition and she always sends me a pair of shoes filled with candies.

NOELLE	(reading) These are the shoes I wore when I met your grandfather and took my first steps towards my future. 

ALLISON	Oh! 

NOELLE	(reading) May they guide you towards your future and bring you some Christmas magic.

ALLISON	Magic? You didn't tell me those shoes we're magic.

NOELLE	Well, she thinks they're magic. But I've had my fair share of ups and downs with them. 

ALLISON	Boo!

NOELLE	Magic is not real. But I sure do like wearing my Christmas shoes.

ALLISON	Christmas shoe season has begun!

ALLISON	So what’s the magic behind these ones again?

NOELLE	Something about: Sticky situations. 

ALLISON	(small laugh) Because they're bubblegum pink?

NOELLE	Yup and she filled them with bubblegum that year.

NOELLE	Look, it's lunch time do you want to go do some Christmas shopping?

ALLISON	Yeah you had me at lunch. 

ALLISON	Let's go.

ALLISON	You I am so glad that we didn't waist a lunch break actually eating lunch! 

NOELLE	(laughs) I had to get my parent's Christmas gifts. Here - have a cookie!

NOELLE	You know, last time I spent the holidays with my grandmother in the Netherlands - their gifts, they barely made it there on time. So --

ALLISON	It's okay I got a great dress for my Christmas party --

NOELLE	Ah!

ALLISON	although I think I'm going to have to skip these cookies if want this to fit, so.

NOELLE	Your loss!

NOELLE	Oh, you know what? I just have to make one more stop at Reid's Candy. You go ahead.

ALLISON	More gifts? You're putting Santa to shame.

NOELLE	No, this one, it's-- it's really special. My Dad, he proposed to my mom there with a peppermint ring when they were teenagers.

ALLISON	What? I didn't know your parents were high school sweethearts.

NOELLE	Yeah. He always said that he knew she was the one the first moment he laid his eyes on her, but that was the only ring that he could afford, so now I just-- I always like to get them something special this time of year.

ALLISON	That is so sweet. You are such a secret romantic.

NOELLE	Reid's Candies and that peppermint ring, that's the only thing that makes me believe that romance is still alive, so.

ALLISON	Well, I hope so. Do me a favor, pick me up one of those peppermint rings. I think I need one.

NOELLE	Done!

NOELLE	What?!

NOELLE	Oh!!

NOELLE	Ugh! Really?! Oh! 

JOHN	Looks like you're stuck there.

NOELLE	Excuse me?

JOHN	The bubble-gum.

NOELLE	Uh, yeah. I guess so.

JOHN	Would you mind? May I?

NOELLE	Sure. (awkward giggle)

JOHN	It's not the first sticky situation I've gotten out of.

NOELLE	Thank-you.

JOHN	I can't believe that they're closing this location. What kind of Grinch's run this place?

JOHN	You must really love this store.

NOELLE	I do. You know that they make the best candy canes.

JOHN	I do. I had my first job here.

NOELLE	Really?

JOHN	Yup.

NOELLE	(groans) Thank you.

JOHN	John Reid.

JOHN	Excuse me.

NOELLE	John Reid. It's Reid's Candy. That's John.

NOELLE	(sighing)

NOELLE	(grunting)

NOELLE	(groaning)

JOHN	These numbers are underwhelming to say the least. We've got to do something about this. 

NOELLE	Smells so good. 

JOHN	Can I help you? I see you found the candy canes.

NOELLE	Hi. Look, I'm really sorry about the Grinch thing.

JOHN	Don't sweat it. It's fine.

NOELLE	I just-- I really-- I can't believe that this is my last Christmas at this Reid's.

JOHN	Well, it doesn't have to be.

NOELLE	Stop by any other location. Time Square, very popular.

NOELLE	Thank you, but it's really not the same.

JOHN	Yeah. I wish more people saw it that way. If I'm being honest, it's my father's decision. The profit's just way down here.

NOELLE	uh...Maybe I could help.

JOHN	What, are you going to buy the entire inventory?

NOELLE	No, I would love to, but no. I'm actually a CPA, so if you want, I could look at your numbers. Maybe just a few financial tweaks here and there could increase sales and then, who knows? Maybe this Reid's Candy could live to see another Christmas.

JOHN	Well, my father does believe in numbers.

NOELLE	Yeah, well, he's smart 'cause numbers, they never lie.

JOHN	And neither do you from what I can tell.

NOELLE	So, look, if you want, here's my card. We're just at Wiltern CPA up the street. If you're interested.

JOHN	Yeah, I'm interested. This afternoon, does that work?

NOELLE	Sure. Yeah. I think that works.

JOHN	All right. Great. Candy cane. On the house. 

NOELLE	Thank you.

JOHN	I'll see you later.

NOELLE	See you later.

NOELLE	Yeah?

ALLISON	Uh, hello. Hot date?

NOELLE	What? No. Why?

ALLISON	Well, you've cleaned your entire desk and checked your makeup twice since lunch. Something's happening.

NOELLE	I, um, I may have gotten into a sticky situation.

ALLISON	Okay, hold on. I'll be right there.

ALLISON	What happened?

NOELLE	So, that Reid's Candy store location, they're closing it. - Can you believe that?

ALLISON	No! Don't they know that that is a landmark of love?

NOELLE	That's funny. That's very funny. So I may have, (clears throat), insulted the owner.

ALLISON	How?

NOELLE	I kind of called him a Grinch.

ALLISON	What, he ban you for life?

NOELLE	No. No, he didn't. I mean, he scraped gum off my shoe and then I offered to look at his books.

NOELLE	What?

ALLISON	Wait. Didn't your grandma give you these shoes to get you out of sticky situations?

NOELLE	Maybe, kind of.

ALLISON	(whispering) Oh, my gosh. They are totally magical.

NOELLE	No! No, they're not magical because I wore my magical Christmas shoes on one of the worst days ever. You know, it really snapped me out of believing in the magic of them and any silly notion of me becoming and interior designer.

ALLISON	You were wearing your shoes that day?

NOELLE	Yes, the day I lost my internship and my boyfriend.

ALLISON	Oh, well, it's more like your boyfriend stole your ideas and your internship. There's no reason to blame your shoes for that. 

NOELLE	You're projecting. And this, it's just a coincidence.

ALLISON	Noelle, (whispering) you literally stepped in bubble-gum. There are no such thing as coincidences.

ALLISON	Whoa. If that is John, you need to change into your red pumps ASAP.

NOELLE	(whispering) They're not magic.

ALLISON	(whispering) Yes, they are.

NOELLE	(whispering) They're not magic.

JOHN	Hey, Noelle. Is this a good time?

NOELLE	Absolutely, yes. Allison, this is John Reid.

ALLISON	Uh - Hi!

JOHN	Hi.

ALLISON	Nice to meet you. Ha! Noelle is thrilled to get started on your looks --

NOELLE	Books. Books. Allison has had a really long day, haven't you?

ALLISON	Yes. I'm sorry. Let me get you a chair.

JOHN	That'd be great. Thanks.

NOELLE	Oh!!

JOHN	Down payment.

NOELLE	Oh, Thank you. These are my favorite.

NOELLE	Consider yourself paid in full. Love these.

ALLISON	Uh here. Here you go.

JOHN	Thank you.

ALLISON	You're welcome.

NOELLE	Thanks, Allison!

NOELLE	Have a seat. Just have a look at these numbers.

JOHN	These are cute.

NOELLE	Oh, thank you. Thank you.

JOHN	 And that? That's an early Christmas gift?

NOELLE	Yes, that's from my grandmother.

JOHN	Would you mind if I read this?

NOELLE	Sure.

JOHN	Wow. That is sweet. You got some grandma there.

NOELLE	Yeah, she always includes a note, it's supposed to help with the magic, or so she believes.

JOHN	So, what do you think?

NOELLE	Well, (sighs) your numbers, they're on a giant decline. Have you had a bad Yelp review or?

JOHN	No, we have excellent customer service, I make sure of that.

NOELLE	That's it!

JOHN	Did I get a bad review?

NOELLE	No, look at-- you have these beautiful windows and there's nothing in them.

JOHN	So, what do I do? Like, a big neon sign in the window? One of those inflatable like, tubey guys? Giant candy cane?
NOELLE	No. You need - you need something that is just going to stop people in their tracks. I think I have an idea.

JOHN	Look, I don't know. It would have to be

JOHN	pretty spectacular. We'd have to hire a designer and where are we going to find on such short notice? It's already December 5th.

NOELLE	Well, you're in luck. Already found!

JOHN	You?

NOELLE	Mm-hmm.

JOHN	You're an accountant.

NOELLE	Well, I'm a very creative one. I love your store. I know exactly what to do. I mean, this Christmas nobody is walking by Reid's window.

JOHN	Right, okay. What have I got to lose?

NOELLE	Really?

JOHN	Yeah.

NOELLE	 Okay. You've got to trust me.

JOHN	All right. I'll let you in and have at it.

NOELLE	Okay.

NOELLE	Thank you!

JOHN	Good luck with that!

NOELLE	Thanks.

NOELLE	Stop! Stop! Stop!

ALLISON	Uh, what happened? It looks like you did the walk of shame from Santa's village.

NOELLE	Oh.

ALLISON	Anyways, what is so urgent that I had to miss yoga?

NOELLE	(clears throat) This coffee for starters, and I just--I really need a second opinion before John sees it.

ALLISON	Oh. Okay.

NOELLE	And close your eyes. Just humor me.

NOELLE	Okay. This way. And we're walking. And we're walking, A little step here. Keep walking.

ALLISON	Mmhmm. Grandma is right on time. 

ALLISON	Aaand. Open them.

ALLISON	Oh wow! You did this?

NOELLE	Yeah.

ALLISON	Are those little Christmas shoes?!

NOELLE	Yes. Yes. They look exactly like the first pair my grandmother gave me and that Christmas I took my very first steps and she just swore that the shoes had Christmas magic in them.

ALLISON	Look at this. It draws me in. It's beautiful.

NOELLE	Thank you.

ALLISON	It's good to see you creative again. It gives you a glow.

NOELLE	Oh, stop it. It does feel good though, you know? It feels like I'm flexing an unused muscle.

ALLISON	Okay, well, I'm going to go back to the office. You need to get this-- what is that? Pine needles.

NOELLE	Garland.

ALLISON	Out of your hair. I'll cover for you.

NOELLE	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

ALLISON	You're welcome.

NOELLE	(shrieking)

NOELLE	Great little window over there.

NOELLE	There's a great window across the street. (chuckling)

NOELLE	Yes!

JOHN	Merry Christmas! Thank you so much. Thank you.

JOHN	Please, come on in.

JOHN	Ha. Merry Christmas.

NOELLE	Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

JOHN	Hi!

NOELLE	Hey.

JOHN	Hey, look at you, Ginger Rogers. Don't stop dancing on my account.

NOELLE	(chuckling) Just happened to be in the area. Thought I'd check it out.

JOHN	Well, that is great work. People seem to really love it. The store's been busy all morning.

NOELLE	You don't think that it's just a little over the top?

JOHN	No, not at all. Normal is boring, and that is definitely not normal.

NOELLE	I come by it honestly.

JOHN	All right. Let's check the numbers.

NOELLE	Okay.

NOELLE	Everything okay?

JOHN	It's not good.

NOELLE	What? What do you mean?

JOHN	It's great. Single day record sales and we are not even done yet.

NOELLE	You're very funny.

JOHN	Thank you. And you're very talented. You know, I would hire you to design another window but I'm sure my accountant would say I can't afford it.

NOELLE	Hmm. But if your designer works for candy, I think that your accountant would say to go for it.

JOHN	Really? All right. Would you do me the honor of designing me another window?

JOHN	Oh-- It's-- I can pay you. I'm just joking. I'm just being silly.

NOELLE	(stammering) No! Yes! I do. I do, um, I agree to do another window for you. Sure.

JOHN	Okay. Great. Excuse the bad jokes, all right?

NOELLE	(chuckling)

JOHN	Just keep sprinkling your Christmas magic, let Rich know, he's the manager, if you need anything.

NOELLE	Wait a minute, you're - so you're leaving?

JOHN	If we're going to save this store, Dad needs to see these record sales ASAP.

NOELLE	Right. Right. Right. Right.

JOHN	I hope you got some more sweet ideas.

NOELLE	I have a whole closet of inspiration.

JOHN	I look forward to it.

NOELLE	(groans)

JOHN	Dad!

JOHN	I saw the future of Reid's Candies today.

ARTHUR	That's great, Son.

JOHN	Our Maple Street store was packed. Would you like to know why?

ARTHUR	Let's see, it's Christmas? People buy candy?

JOHN	The windows, they were decorated with these Christmas shoes.

ARTHUR	What do shoes have to do with candy?

JOHN	Well, they were these Dutch wooden shoes with candy in it, right next to a Christmas tree and our candy was the centerpiece. The point is, it became a Christmas attraction, it drew people into the store to buy candy. Take a look at the numbers.

ARTHUR	Wow. Those are impressive sales.

JOHN	Exactly, right? Why don't we let each store create their own window with their own artistic interpretation of Reid's Candies at Christmas?

ARTHUR	Yeah, you see, that's the artist in you speaking, and if you want to become CEO of this company you are going to have to have a little more business savvy.

JOHN	Can you just let me work with this one store, please?

ARTHUR	I'll admit the numbers are good, all right? But every location has good days.

JOHN	Right.

ARTHUR	Look, I'll tell you what, you dress another window and if you can replicate those sales we'll talk about your idea.

JOHN	You got yourself a deal.

NOELE	Fa la la la la,la la la la Dah bah doop doop,doody do do Fa la la la la,la la la la 

NOELLE	Fa la la la la la,la la la Dooby do dah,boo do do do Bah dah dah dah dah Ah!

ARTHUR	Hey.

NOELLE	Ah! Hi.

OFFICE STAFF	(clapping, murmuring)

ALLISON	Oh, yeah! Yeah, everybody loves your dancing, Ms. Dancing Machine. Somebody is on a sugar high. Here, I think you need this.

NOELLE	Its' actually a Christmas high.

ALLISON	(under breath) Oh.

NOELLE	Guess what? The window was a huge success and John, he asked me to create another window, so.

ALLISON	No.

NOELLE	Yeah. Allison, I just, I forgot how much I love designing.

ALLISON	I always knew that designing was your calling. I don't know how you ended up in accounting.

NOELLE	Mm. More control. I get to call the shots and I get to do things on my own terms.

ALLISON	But at what cost?

JOHN	Hey.

NOELLE	Hi.

JOHN	Am I interrupting?

NOELLE	No.

ALLISON	Yeah, no, no. Noelle was just tap dancing. Wow. Yeah, I have-- I got to go.

NOELLE	You're not wearing a watch.

JOHN	You're a dancer? You practically fell over when you stepped in gum.

NOELLE	Thank you for reminding me. No, I'm not a dancer but my grandmother, she gave me these tap shoes one Christmas, so.

JOHN	Those are tap shoes?

NOELLE	Mm-hmm. Well, I had them re-soled so I could, you know, wear them in the real world.

JOHN	Please, don't let me stop you dancing. Please. Come on.

NOELLE	Oh...No, I did my encore for good.

NOELLE	So, listen, the spike in sales, do you think that that's going to help save the location?

JOHN	Possibly. That's why I'm here. Um. Can we redesign a new window tonight?

NOELLE	Tonight?

JOHN	I know it's a quick turnaround but my dad said that if we can replicate those numbers with a new display, that maybe he'll start listening to my ideas and possibly save the Maple Street location.

NOELLE	John! That's amazing!

JOHN	Yes, I know.

NOELLE	Uh, okay. I don't usually do spontaneity but I could come up with some ideas.

JOHN	Okay, great. How can I help?

NOELLE	Oh, that's-- you know, I really-- I just-- I like to work solo on things.

JOHN	Yeah, okay. Um, well, I do have an artistic background so if you change your mind.

NOELLE	Maybe.

JOHN	Okay, I understand. I'll go let the manager know that you're going to be working all night by yourself. 

NOELLE	Okay.

JOHN	Okay. Good luck.

NOELLE	Thank you.

JOHN	Thank you. Thank you!

ALLISON	Solo act, are you kidding me?!

NOELLE	What are you?? You're hiding there?

ALLISON	Duh!

ALLISON	Listen, what were you thinking?

NOELLE	(stammering) What do you mean, "What am I thinking?" I-- you know what? I'm thinking that I like to work alone.

ALLISON	You need to let go of these control issues.

NOELLE	No, okay? No. I've been down that path and I'm not going down it again.

ALLISON	Okay. Show me your new design ideas.

NOELLE	Well, I was thinking about sticking to what works best: the magical Christmas shoes!

NOELLE	(shrieking)

NOELLE	What are you doing here?

JOHN	Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

NOELLE	Sorry. I mean, (stammering) I told you that I didn't need any help.

JOHN	(stammering) Yeah, well. You're not a little bit happy to see me? Just-- I caught you there.

NOELLE	Thank you. So what? Were you just watching me this whole time?

JOHN	Not the whole time, no. That'd be creepy.

JOHN	Well, I know when an artist is in the zone so I'm going to leave you alone.

NOELLE	I mean, you don't have to, it is your store after all.

JOHN	That's a good point. I make a mean coco.

NOELLE	I would love a coco.

JOHN	Okay.

NOELLE	(under breath) Okay.

JOHN	So I see you stuck with the shoe theme.

NOELLE	Mm-hmm.

JOHN	What's the story behind the magical Christmas tap shoes?

NOELLE	Well, freshman year of high school I auditioned for the lead in "A White Christmas" and I thought it was going to be the start of an illustrious Broadway career. And there was an elaborate tap dance number for the role that I thought I could somehow magically pull off with zero experience and a nice pair of shoes.

JOHN	Of course. How could you not?

NOELLE	So my grandmother, she always encourages me to, you know, chase after my dreams and she sent me this pair for Christmas.

JOHN	And you went on to glowing reviews and a full page spread in the yearbook and a full ride to Julliard, right?

NOELLE	Absolutely ... not. No, I bombed it. It was really bad. I didn't even make the chorus. But I did join the art department and we made some great sets and that's when I found my love for design.

JOHN	So you did chase your dream by following your heart, not as a dancer but as an artist. Proving your grandmother right, Christmas dreams really do come true. Am I right?

NOELLE	I mean, I've never thought about it like that but I guess you are. 

JOHN	You know, I love the use of the watercolors on the audience, it provides balance and depth without drawing your eye away from the focus which is the shoes. It's quite spectacular..

NOELLE	You really sound like you know what you're talking about.

JOHN	Yeah, a little. I had four years at the Royal College of Art.

NOELLE	Wow! Seems like an odd choice for a future CEO.

JOHN	Yup. That's what my dad thought too, and he was right. I guess, yeah, sometimes I wish I took a shot but I couldn't - I couldn't walk away from the family business.

NOELLE	But are you happy?

JOHN	Happy? It's been a while since someone asked me that. Um. Sure, I'm happy. Yeah. Of course I'm happy.

NOELLE	Oh, that's that is a ringing endorsement for happiness if I ever heard one.

JOHN	You're right. Yeah. Um. All right. If I'm being honest, the business is my dad's dream. Don't get me wrong, I love the company, and you know, especially how we bring together people at Christmas, especially the kids, you know? Their excitement is the best part. Yeah, but I do wish that he saw me for me instead of what he wants me to be.

NOELLE	Right.

JOHN	Your window is-- looks awesome.

NOELLE	Oh! It's not even finished yet.

JOHN	Hey, I know this artist that's got a background in candy, loves Christmas, available on short notice

NOELLE	Maybe he could help me.

JOHN	Mmhmm.

NOELLE	(giggling) Okay, so, what do you think so far?

NOELLE	(Brrr (shivering)

JOHN	(quietly) Sorry.

NOELLE	Ah! It looks so good! Not too bad for a couple hours work.

JOHN	Yeah, that was the most fun I've had working in the store probably ever.

NOELLE	Really?

JOHN	Yeah. 

JOHN	Do you really have a story for every one of your magical Christmas shoes?

NOELLE	Mm-hmm. There's a story for every one. Although, I'm not so sure about the magic.

JOHN	You have a lot of them?

NOELLE	I do. I have an entire bedroom closet full of them.

JOHN	I'd love to see your bedroom.

JOHN	Your-- I--Your bedroom closet, for the shoes 

NOELLE	The shoes.

JOHN	and the stories. The windows, right? The windows.

NOELLE	Yes

JOHN	Uh. Uh huh.

NOELLE	I mean, tomorrow Allison and I were going to go Christmas tree shopping, if you want to come and then you could swing by after and see the shoes.

JOHN	Yeah. I'd like that.

JOHN	Okay.

NOELLE	Okay. Well, goodnight.

JOHN	Goodnight.

NOELLE	Seriously, it's not like that. (TO PASSERBY) Merry Christmas.

ALLISON	This guy is not Mark. You can't control everything. Sometimes you might just catch some feelings.

NOELLE	Okay, look. This might sounds crazy but I-- I think there might be something going on with the shoes because I-- so, I wore the bubble-gum ones and I actually stepped in gum, and then I wore the tap shoes meant for chasing my dreams--
ALLISON	And then you found yourself back into design. Like I told you, there is no such thing as a coincidence. So, tell me, what's the story behind these boots?

NOELLE	Uh. I went to the Netherlands to visit my grandmother a few years again and--

ALLISON	That's so cute. 

ALLISON	Is that a windmill?

NOELLE	Mm-hmm. 

NOELLE	It's very Dutch. And she said it would always bring me what I want. So maybe that means finding my perfect Christmas tree. 
ALLISON	Okay, maybe not just a tree, maybe it'll help you find something else that you want, or need.

JOHN	Hi.

NOELLE	Hi! 

JOHN	Congratulations. You made a Christmas must-see list.

ALLISON	Looks like your shoes still got it.

JOHN	So?

ALLISON	Oh. Oh. Uh. My neighbor needs me. I got to go.

NOELLE	Your phone didn't even ring.

NOELLE 	It buzzed. It's on silent. Yeah, she needs my help. It's urgent. You guys are fine, right?

JOHN	I am if you are.

ALLISON	Great!

NOELLE	Of course.

ALLISON	Okay.

JOHN	She's really eager to help her neighbor, huh?

NOELLE	Yes, that is-- that's Allison, always eager to help, even when you don't need her.

JOHN	Well then, uh…

NOELLE	All right. Here we are!

NOELLE	You got it?!

JOHN	Yeah - yeah. I got it.

NOELLE	Okay. Right this way!

JOHN	If I'd have known I definitely would have made the case for a skinnier tree. Yeah, maybe one that went to Pilates.

NOELLE	Oh yeah? Well, maybe the tree's thinking the same thing about you.

JOHN	I Spin.

NOELLE	(laughing) Can you make it another ten feet or would you like a glass of water?

JOHN	Here. I'll take the water.

NOELLE	(laughing)

JOHN	The cleared-out corner with the stand?

NOELLE	Actually, upstairs, if you don't mind.

JOHN	We're at the joking phase, huh?

NOELLE	There you go.

JOHN	(sighs) Thanks.

NOELLE	It looks amazing! Thank you so much, I really appreciate this.

JOHN	No problem. 

JOHN	So.

NOELLE	So.

JOHN	Do I get to see the magical Christmas shoes?

NOELLE	The shoes, right. Okay. You asked for it.

NOELLE	Tah-dah!

JOHN	Wow. This is impressive. Every year, huh?

NOELLE	Every year without fail and each of them has a note.

JOHN	Where do we start?

NOELLE	Well, you have to pick one.

JOHN	Okay. Umm…

NOELLE	Nope! Close your eyes.

JOHN	Really?

NOELLE	These are the rules.

JOHN	Oh my.

NOELLE	(laughing)

JOHN	I'm like a three-year-old.

NOELLE	Yup. Stop.

JOHN	I'm in the exact same spot.

JOHN	Feel better? Okay good. I'm going for it.

NOELLE	Oh! Hmmm.

JOHN	Oh! Wow! These are sexy. Look at these. I can only imagine the magic you created in these.

NOELLE	Of course you had to pick these one first.

JOHN	(reading) "This Christmas take comfort in grace rather than style."

JOHN	Yes, Grandma was not kidding. These are the definition of comfort. 

NOELLE	Hey, I broke my toe that year and these really killed a lot of my Christmas looks.

JOHN	I'm sure you still pulled off some looks.

NOELLE	Hmm. Well, thank you.

JOHN	Uh. How about your favorite?

NOELLE	Oh, that's hard. My favorite?

JOHN	Mm-hmm.

NOELLE	Um. Mmm.

NOELLE	I mean…excuse me.

NOELLE	Ready?

JOHN	Ready.

NOELLE	Are you ready?

JOHN	Whoa. Those are very, uh, Santa baby.

JOHN	By far my favourite.

NOELLE	I can only imagine what kind of windows these would inspire.

JOHN	(whisper) What's the story?

NOELLE	(reading) "This Christmas don't dwell on Mark. The magic here is a conversation starter to light a spark."

JOHN	A minx and a poet.

NOELLE	Well, she is from Amsterdam. (giggling)

JOHN	These are brand new.

NOELLE	I know, I've never actually worn those.

JOHN	You've never been ice-skating?

NOELLE	Oh, I've been ice-skating, just not in those. But it's been a really long time.

JOHN	Same for me. It's like riding a bike, though, right?

NOELLE	Is it?

JOHN	How about we go tomorrow night?

NOELLE	No, I'm not in the mood to break my ankle.

JOHN	I will not let you fall, I promise.

NOELLE	(inhales) We should, ah --

JOHN	Yeah. The tree.

NOELLE	Yes!

JOHN	Let's do it!

NOELLE	Yes, I mean, it's not gonna decorate itself.

NOELLE	Ready for another one?

JOHN	Indeed.

NOELLE	This is a good one.

JOHN	Oh, the magical Christmas shoes, ornament version. Very nice.

NOELLE	Well, they are my heritage. It would not be Christmas without them.

JOHN	I almost forgot.

NOELLE	It's perfect.

NOELLE	It's a windmill.

JOHN	Yeah, I saw it at the register, and I thought immediately of you.

NOELLE	Uh uh.

JOHN	It's Dutch, right?

NOELLE	Yes, yes. Windmills, they are definitely Dutch. Thank you, I love it. It's gonna look really good right... there...Thank you!
JOHN	So. Have you always believed the shoes were magical?

NOELLE	Oh, no, no. Not all of them have a happy ending, which is why my practical side doesn't let me get carried away
with it.

JOHN	Well, I see how they inspire your windows, and I definitely believe there's magic in them. I can see it.

NOELLE	My grandmother would love you.

JOHN	Yeah. Most grandma's do.

NOELLE/JOHN	(laughing)

JOHN	You know what I'm thinking? Hey, maybe next year, we can package wooden shoes and candies.

NOELLE	That is a great idea. And what if we added little paints, so that the children, they could paint their magical Christmas wishes on them.

JOHN	I absolutely love it. Yeah, which means my dad will hate it.

NOELLE	So, where did you get your love for art?

JOHN	My mom. She'd take me around to see all the Christmas windows, and yeah, my favorite ones were the painted ones. And so, when I was ten, I painted all the windows in our house to surprise her. Poinsettias were her favorite, and of course, she loved it. She cried when we had to take it down for Easter, but...

NOELLE	Oh!! (laughing) I love that. So, is that when you decided you were an artist?

JOHN	Yeah, pretty much, but you know, I always knew it'd be a pipe dream. When your last name is Reid, your candied future is pretty much written for you.
NOELLE	Not necessarily. It's your life. You know, I had to learn the hard way,and it's important to take control.

JOHN	Right, that's why you're an accountant?

NOELLE	Absolutely. I mean, I get to choose who my clients are, make my own hours, I can just do things on my terms.

JOHN	And you never wanted to do anything creative?

NOELLE	I mean, I did, and then...and then, I didn't. Actually, in my first-- excuse me --year in college, I was up for this prestigious internship at a high-end design firm.
JOHN	What happened?

NOELLE	Well, my boyfriend at the time, Mark…

JOHN	Oh, Mr. Sexy Boots Mark.

NOELLE	Yes! Mr. Sexy Boots Mark. He was also applying for it. And we, um...we always would work our presentations together, but we had very different styles. I like to tell a story through my work. I feel like it adds a personal touch to the design. But Mark, he convinced me that it wasn't professional. So, at the last minute, I changed my entire portfolio, and at the final meeting, I marched in there with my magic Christmas shoes, determined to be professional. (laughing) And I bombed it.

JOHN	So, you didn't go with your gut, or stick to your own terms.

NOELLE	Exactly. And to make matters worse, Mark, he then used my style of storytelling design in his interview, and he got the internship and now, he has an illustrious design career. So, cheers, Mark.

JOHN	To Mark, what a great guy.

NOELLE	Mm. (swallowing) And that's how I lost my faith in the fabled magical Christmas shoes.

JOHN	So, you stopped doing something that you love and you gave up magic all because of this guy Mark?

NOELLE	No, I...I mean, I chose to pivot. I love design, but I also love a career that has less heartbreak.

JOHN	Well, if it wasn't for this Mark guy, I would have never met you, and your shoes.

NOELLE	Well, that is a perk.(giggling)

JOHN	It's getting late, isn't it? I should get going.

NOELLE	Yes, it is. 

NOELLE	Well, thank you again.

JOHN	My pleasure.

JOHN	Okay, good night

NOELLE	Good night.

JOHN	'Night Noelle.

NOELLE	Good night.

NOELLE	(reading) "This Christmas, go with the flow and laugh along the way." (laughs. Sighs)

ALLISON	Whoa, hey!

NOELLE	What? Ah!

ALLISON	No pouring and texting!

NOELLE	Thank you.

ALLISON	You're all smiles today. Is a certain candy man making this Christmas extra sweet?

NOELLE	Gross! Would you listen to yourself?

ALLISON	Hey, I am an expert in energy, and I was feeling some serious vibes from you two last night.

NOELLE	John and I, we are just friends.

ALLISON	Who were you texting?

NOELLE	John.

ALLISON	(laughs)

NOELLE	It is not like that. He is sending me articles of our window. We're in all the holiday must-see lists.

ALLISON	He is so dreamy. Any red-blooded woman would want to unwrap him Christmas morning.

NOELLE	Would you listen to yourself? If there's one thing that Mark did teach me, it's not to date people you work with.

ALLISON	He's not your boss. And more importantly, he's not Mark?

NOELLE	(clears throat) 

ALLISON	This can't be good.

MARK	Hey!

NOELLE		Mark. What-What are you doing here?

MARK	I'm home for Christmas. You know, seeing the family and play with the little cousins and the nephews. Have you seen the Reid store window yet? That thing is amazing! It's the talk of the town. And rumor is that...well, that you're the genius behind it.

ALLISON	Well, the rumors are true.

MARK	Hey, Allison.

ALLISON	Hey, Mark.

NOELLE	(stammering) It's just for Christmas, and it's not a big deal.

MARK	Ah. Can, uh, can we chat?

ALLISON	Oh! Right!

NOELLE	Ahem, what is this, a peace offering?

MARK	I remembered they were your favorite. You know, it's Christmas. Okay, well, the Reid store window is quite the sensation. I never know that you were getting back into design.

NOELLE	I'm not. Why?

MARK	Come work for me.

NOELLE	(laughs)

MARK	I need a good designer. I'm serious. My new company is ready to launch. Come and have a drink with me tonight, and I'll give you the details.

NOELLE	No, I -- I have plans.

MARK	Cancel them! This could be a new career for the both of us.

NOELLE	Thank you, but I have a career and I left that silly fantasy of becoming a designer a long time ago.

MARK	Hey, look, at least entertain the idea. Just hear me out before you say no.

MARK	Look, look. Listen, listen. I know that we have a rocky past.

NOELLE	That's an understatement.

MARK	You deserved that internship, not me.

NOELLE	Mmhmm.

MARK	So, let me make it right. 

MARK	So, let me make it right. Listen, if you hate what I say, you can throw your drink in my face.

ALLISON	Oh, can I come? Please?

NOELLE	No, I'll hear him out. But not tonight. And you should bring goggles, because I hear that vodka, it really stings your eyes.

MARK	(laughing) I heard that, too! Amazing, well, okay. We'll set something up before Christmas.

MARK	Well, you ladies have a good day.

ALLISON	So, was that the angry speech that you've been rehearsing all these years?

NOELLE	Funny. No, he just...He just gets under my skin and makes me feel all these feelings.

ALLISON	Ew, really?

ALLISON	You know, I never knew what you saw in him, not even in high school.

NOELLE	No, not Mark, design. I mean, it is what I love. It's what I've always wanted to do. And doing Reid's windows, it reminded me of that. And now…

ALLISON	Well, your grandma's shoes did say something about stepping into your future.

NOELLE	I don't know, I…

ALLISON	Or not?

NOELLE	You know what, maybe...maybe you are right.

ALLISON	Oh?

NOELLE	Okay, so I was running late this morning and I just grabbed the first pair of Christmas shoes that I could find, and it just happened to be these ones. These are the ones that I wore when I blew the deal for the internship, when I listened to what Mark said.

ALLISON	Really?

NOELLE	Yes, and the note on them, it said, "We hope that people, they see your genius as much as we do." And Mark, he just said "genius." So, I mean, if these shoes are magical, right, what if they're also cursed? Because the last time Mark said "genius", he stole my design.

ALLISON	Wait, what if the shoes are trying to correct the past? I mean, Mark sucks, but that is a huge opportunity.

NOELLE	I know, I know. I mean, if he's even serious.

ALLISON	Well, if he's not, when are you ever gonna get that invitation to throw a drink in your ex's face again?


JOHN	It's so tight.

NOELLE	I don't know if this is a good idea. I mean, I haven't skated in a really long time.

JOHN	Well, I promise not to let you fall.

NOELLE	You better not, because if you do, I'm just gonna take you down with me.

JOHN	Oh, yeah, you promise?

NOELLE	Mm-hm, darn right.

NOELLE	Okay. Talk is cheap. You ready?

JOHN	Yup.

NOELLE	One.

JOHN	One.

NOELLE/JOHN	Two, three! 

NOELLE	So far, so good.

NOELLE	(over shoulder) John?

JOHN	Hold on, I'm coming.

NOELLE	You have to stand up!

JOHN	Ohhhhh.

NOELLE	Hey.

NOELLE	Wow! 

JOHN	Hi. How's it going?

NOELLE	I thought you said it was just like riding a bike.

JOHN	Uh, yeah, I said that?

NOELLE	Yeah, you did.

JOHN	Well, then I lied.

NOELLE	(laughs) Like, at this pace, it's gonna take us till next Christmas to get around the rink.

JOHN	Okay.

NOELLE	Here.

JOHN	Okay, you got some tips?

NOELLE	Mmhmm.

JOHN	Here we go!

NOELLE	Okay. You're squeezing my hand really tight. Just breathe, 

JOHN	Okay.

NOELLE	for starters. Okay, just kind of try to relax a little bit.

JOHN	Hey what are you --

NOELLE	Eee! Fly, baby bird, fly!

NOELLE	(screeches, laughs)

JOHN	I got you! It's all good! Oh!

NOELLE	Ah, that was really fun.

JOHN	Yeah, so smooth.(sighing)

NOELLE	Ah! So, what next? You want to grab a bite?

JOHN	Uh… Actually, I got somewhere to be.

NOELLE	Oh! Okay. Yeah, just here to get some inspiration for the window, and we did.

JOHN	No, it's not like that. Hey, I'd love to show you the place where I spend most of my free time.

NOELLE	Now?

JOHN	Yeah now.

NOELLE	Oh!

JOHN	If you're free.

NOELLE	Sure! Yes.

JOHN	(quietly) Okay.

JOHN	All right, guys, so for today's theme, we're gonna go with Christmas, and my friend Noelle here has a closet filled with magical Christmas shoes, and she's going to tell you all about them. 

NOELLE	I am?!

JOHN	You are.

NOELLE	I am! Well, um...Every Christmas, my grandmother, she sends me a new pair of shoes and they're always filled with candies, and with them, she writes a message that says at Christmastime, they become magic.

GEORGIA	Are they really magic?

NOELLE	Well, today I wore a pair of ice skates that she gave me for the first time, and I didn't fall, so...Mind you, I also had someone holding my hand and that really helped.

JOHN	Okay, so what you're going to do is you're gonna paint your own version of magical Christmas shoes, and how they make your holiday season special, all right?

NOELLE	I'm joining you!

JOHN	Well, that's beautiful.

JOHN	There you go, just let it go.

GIRL IN GLASSES	What?

JOHN	Just let it go.

JOHN	Oh, that's beautiful.

JOHN	What inspired this piece?

NOELLE	Let's see, my... my grandmother, and of course, my favorite candy. It's a little bit of an homage to this great coach who's even a better art teacher. Someone that keeps surprising me.

JOHN	Well, it's very, very good.

JOHN	Um, may I?

NOELLE	Sure.

JOHN	Now, if you just shade it a little more here, that'll give it some definition.

NOELLE	Oh yeah!

GIRL IN GLASSES	Mr. Reid, clean up on our school floor!

NOELLE	(giggling)

JOHN	Be right back.

JOHN	Who did this?

JOHN	All right, I got it. You are gonna need some more paint. Want some more green?

JOHN	You want to do it or you want me to help you?

GEORGIA	Hmm. Me.

GEORGIA	Smells good.

NOELLE	You know, it's too bad you couldn't do this all the time. I just, I really think that the world, it would be a better place with your art in it.

JOHN	Well, thank you. I don't disagree. I wish I could do it more at Reid's. You know, I should thank you for giving me the opportunity to infuse a little creativity into corporate sales.

JOHN	Have you, have you ever thought about getting back into design?

NOELLE	Um. I mean, that's a...that is a really big risk. 

NOELLE	Although I do wish it was Christmas all year round. That way, I could always be decorating.

JOHN	Yeah. You know, isn't it funny how as kids, we are taught to follow our dreams, to take big risks. Then, we become adults and the real world just kicks those beliefs right out of us.

NOELLE	I know, it's so cruel, right? And those kids today, I just miss that, you know, that gumption. They're just they're so fearless.

JOHN	Yeah, I know. That's why I love teaching here. You know, kids have a way of showing us how to believe in hope.

NOELLE	Mmm.

JOHN	Hey, let me show you something. 

JOHN	This is my favorite painting. 

NOELLE	Oh, wow.

JOHN	Yeah, when Billy turned this in, he asked me, "How do Santa's reindeer fly?"

NOELLE	(inhaling) Big question.

JOHN	Yeah, I didn't know how to answer, and then, out of nowhere, Georgia pops up and without missing a beat, and she says, "Because they believe they can."

NOELLE	Oh. She's just…

JOHN	I know, I totally felt that. Yeah, maybe that's all it takes. Belief.

NOELLE	John? These are really good. People need to see these. Oh, I love this! I can see why this is your favorite.

JOHN	Yeah, it's pretty great.

NOELLE	They're all great.

JOHN	Here we go.

NOELLE	Thank you.

JOHN	What's that, someone checking up on you?

NOELLE	No, Allison, she just wants to borrow some Christmas decorations for her party. You... you don't want to go with me, do you? It's just, it's a Christmas party.

JOHN	Christmas party? Eh...One condition, you wear those "Santa Baby" boots.

NOELLE	(laughing)

JOHN	You know, just for inspiration.

NOELLE	In your dreams.

JOHN	You really do love candy canes.

NOELLE	I really do.

JOHN	What's the magic behind those shoes?

NOELLE	These ones, the message was, "Christmas brings the sweetest surprises."

JOHN	They were packed with candy canes?

NOELLE	Naturally, they were, but not as good as Reid's. I mean, you guys, you really do make the best.

JOHN	I know. Hey, we got a minute before we open. Can I show you something?

NOELLE	Yeah.

JOHN	Okay. 

JOHN	Did you know that Reid's was founded on candy canes?

NOELLE	Well, it doesn't surprise me, but…

JOHN	Well, it is true. It's a family recipe - My grandfather --.

NOELLE	Thank you

JOHN	He would hand them out at Christmas to all the kids and the demand became so popular that he, ah, founded the store.

NOELLE	Really?

JOHN	Yes.

NOELLE	So, wait a minute, we're --we're making some?

JOHN	Definitely. You ready?

NOELLE	(squealing) Okay!

JOHN	Here we go, we get the pots.

NOELLE	Uh huh.

JOHN	What kind? Traditional?

NOELLE	Yes, please!

JOHN	All right. Can I get you to pour this?

NOELLE	Mm-hmm, okay.

JOHN	Oh, can you pass me a spatula and a whisk, please?

NOELLE	Okay.

JOHN	Pop one in.

JOHN	And pour.

JOHN	Looks good to me. 

JOHN	Okay, give it a good stir.

JOHN	Whisk it up.

NOELLE	This is really cool.

JOHN	A little elbow grease, okay? Come on.

NOELLE	Thank you

JOHN	Ready?

NOELLE	Mmhmm.

JOHN	Hey, this is a rite of passage in my family.

NOELLE	I understand, I feel very honored.

JOHN	Excellent, ready to pour?

NOELLE	Okay. Cheers!

NOELLE	Listen to it.

JOHN	That is the sound of Christmas.

JOHN	Grandpa would be proud. All right, we get the gloves.

NOELLE	(clears throat) Thank you.

JOHN	Here you are. Put these on.

JOHN	So, just spread it back and forth like this.

JOHN	Then, squish them together, nice and soft.

JOHN	Gentle! Gentle!

NOELLE	(laughing) Okay! They're all so different.

JOHN	Each one is unique because they're handmade.

JOHN	Okay, now we're in the final stage.

NOELLE	Okay.

JOHN	This is where we're going to...make the crook.

NOELLE	I'm a little nervous.

JOHN	Let me see what you got.

NOELLE	Okay. So…

JOHN	Really gentle.

NOELLE	(squealing)

JOHN	Just like Bo Peep.

NOELLE	My first candy cane! Do I get to keep these?

JOHN	Of course, yeah. That's your payment for the windows.

ARTHUR	Wow! Seven a.m. and you've already got a huge crowd outside that window, that's impressive.

JOHN	Thanks, thanks, Dad. Um, this is Noelle. She's the one responsible for the crowd and the windows.

NOELLE	Nice to meet you.

ARTHUR	Very nice job, young lady.

NOELLE	Thank you!

ARTHUR	Um. So, what design firm do you work at?

NOELLE	Oh, I'm-I'm just a CPA. The design is more of, um, it's more of a hobby for me.

ARTHUR	Oh. Well, I looked at the numbers, and with a week before Christmas, this store is set to outsell the Times Square location.

NOELLE	What?!

ARTHUR	So, it appears you got your Christmas wish, John. I hate to admit it, but you proved me wrong for once. Store's gonna remain open, but I need you to keep up those sales, okay?

JOHN	Yeah, of course, you got it.

NOELLE	Lovely to meet you.

ARTHUR	Uh, you, as well.

JOHN	(yelling) Yes!!

NOELLE	(squealing) Oh!

JOHN	We just place them in here, let them cool.

NOELLE	Oh, wow.

JOHN	Hang them on the rack, then they'll be set.

NOELLE	(overlapping) Well, they're definitely gonna get cool.

JOHN	Yeah.

NOELLE	Brr!

JOHN	Hey, you know what? Can you start placing them? Just hold on one sec.

NOELLE	(overlapping) Sure.

NOELLE	(calling out) Don't leave me!!

NOELLE	Wow!

NOELLE	Brrr!

JOHN	M'lady.

NOELLE	Thank you.

JOHN	You know, this is gonna sound crazy, but this used to be my favorite room in this whole store.

NOELLE	Really?

JOHN	No matter what time of year it was, I put on a parka, even in the summer, and I'd come in here and I'd just hang out for hours.

NOELLE	And do what?

JOHN	I'd do my homework, play with my toys, read a book. I would... mostly just create art without anyone bugging me.

NOELLE	I get that.

JOHN	You know, you never know where you're gonna find magic, whether it's in a freezer filled with candy, or a closet filled with shoes.

NOELLE	Mhmm, yes! So, basically what you're saying is Mr. Grinch likes it cold. 

JOHN	Absolutely. What's that saying about cold hands?

NOELLE	Warm heart.

CUSTOMERS	(customers chatting indistinctly)

NOELLE	My parents are gonna be thrilled, and you know, if you think about it, technically I would not even be here if it wasn't for your store.

JOHN	You would not. It's all come full circle. Tomorrow at the board meeting, I'm going to pitch your windows and I'm going to propose how a little creativity can really boost sales.

NOELLE	The presentation?

JOHN	Yeah, I was going to keep it a secret, but you know what? I want to implement your vision in all of Reid's windows, with you as the head designer.

NOELLE	Wow, what? Are you serious?

JOHN	Yeah.

NOELLE	(laughing) I mean, don't get me wrong. I really appreciate your vote of confidence, but...John, come on, Christmas is over in a week, and there'll be no more holiday windows.

JOHN	Yeah, but so what? We've accomplished bigger things with less time. And I was thinking that you could assume a more permanent position beyond Christmas.

NOELLE	Umm.

JOHN	Oh.

NOELLE	Look, I'm just not willing to throw away a whole career for a possibility.

JOHN	I've seen how you light up when you design. You cannot deny how good it feels to do something that you love. You've made me believe in Reid's Candies again, that it's more than a store, that it's a place to bring people together to celebrate the sweeter things in life.

NOELLE	Oh, I love this! I love this... so much, but I... I don't know. I... we saved the store. My parents, they fell in love here, and that's why I did all of this, because I wanted to keep a part of their romance alive.

JOHN	Maybe at first, but art is not about obligations, right? It's about your heart. What's your heart say?

NOELLE	You really think this is a possibility?

JOHN	I know it's a possibility.

CUSTOMERS	(customers chatting indistinctly)

NOELLE	Okay, fine, fine! Okay, I'm on board with...I'm on board with the Christmas windows.

ALLISON	Hire you?

NOELLE	No, okay, it's not for sure yet. He still has to convince his dad and the board. So, it's, I mean, it's a longshot at best.

ALLISON	This is huge! Getting out of your safety zone, hard hats off!

NOELLE	(stammering) It is a little crazy, right? I mean, these shoes, they're making me take all kinds of risks, and...it's really scary.

ALLISON	Noelle, it's great. Just go for what you love.

NOELLE	Only if it's the right terms.

ALLISON	Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure. Do things your way, but this is it. Your shoes stepping into your future with John, and a career? You are literally walking in Christmas magic, will you just embrace it?

NOELLE	Okay, it's a little weird! These-these shoes, they came with... 

NOELLE	... a note about a sweet Christmas surprise.

ALLISON	Can you ask your grandma to add me to her Christmas shoe list?

NOELLE	I just, I don't want to get my heart broken again, Allison.

ALLISON	You need to learn to love like heartbreak doesn't exist.

NOELLE	Maybe you're right.

MARK	Hey, ladies!

MARK	Noelle, oh, I got some big news to share with you. Please, you gotta come with me.

NOELLE	Uh, we are working.

MARK	I swear, all business. Please, just come with me.

ALLISON	Oh, please go with him. He won't leave otherwise.

NOELLE	True. (to Mark) This better be good.

MARK	Oh, this is gonna be great.

NOELLE	I will be right back.

MARK	We are looking at our future.

NOELLE	Looks pretty bleak.

MARK	I just signed the ultra high-end shoe boutique Guirlande de Chaussers, and this is their newest location. And together, we will be designing this location and all of their new stores in the tristate area starting in January.
NOELLE	Uh. Mark. I mean I --

MARK	This is huge! This is massive. You see, I told you I would make it up to you. You deserve this, Noelle. Now, come work for me! Uh, with me.

NOELLE	(stammering) Uh...Mark, this is really ...this is a lot. This is a lot to process.

MARK	It is, it is, you're right, you're right. Could you give me an answer before Christmas?

NOELLE	I-I can give you an answer before Christmas.

MARK	Amazing. Nice! I gotta run now, but we will talk very, very soon, okay?

NOELLE	Mhmm.

MARK	Yes!

JOHN	Wow, Santa baby!

NOELLE	(laughs) I'll be sure to tell Grandma you like them.

JOHN	Please do.

NOELLE	Oh, and here are the design schematics, as promised.

JOHN	Thank you, thanks for that. That's great.

NOELLE	Should we go?

JOHN	Yeah, yeah, of course, we should.

NOELLE	Great.

JOHN	Right this way.

NOELLE	Oh, wow!

NOELLE	So, this is it! (giggles)

NOELLE	Hey!!

ALLISON	Hey, guys!

NOELLE	(whooping)

ALLISON	(laughing) Oh, wow. Those boots look great.

NOELLE	Thank you, thank you. It looks amazing in here.

ALLISON	Thanks. Um, can I talk to you for a second? Hey, John. Uh, here, can you take that? Help yourself to some drinks. I just need to steal her for one minute. Snacks, anything you want.

NOELLE	Okay, I'm gonna be right back (to Allison) What are you doing? Allison! Allison, what is going on?

ALLISON	Okay, don't freak out.

NOELLE	I hate it when you say that.

ALLISON	Mark's here.

NOELLE	What? What is Mark doing here? Why is he here?

ALLISON	I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. He was in the group text of old high school friends, and then before I realized, it was too late. And I'm sorry!

NOELLE	I have not told John about his offer! I mean, do you think that Mark is going to go and talk to him?

ALLISON	Mark, pass up an opportunity to brag? Unlikely.

NOELLE	Okay, okay. Okay, all we need to do is we just need to, um, we need to keep them apart, okay? We can do that. I'll take John, you take Mark.

ALLISON	Yeah. May be too late.

NOELLE	(sighs) This is my fault.

ALLISON	What? How?

NOELLE	Because these boots! These boots, they're supposed to be conversation starters, and look, they're talking!

ALLISON	Right, and now you're a believer, great.

NOELLE	That is not helping.

ALLISON	Okay, look, I could...I could create a diversion. I could light the tree on fire, maybe? Something?

NOELLE	No. Look...obviously, these shoes are trying to say something, right? And I just, I need to be clearer with my intentions.

ALLISON	Exactly, yes! Like, like Aladdin and the genie.

NOELLE	What?!

ALLISON	Okay.

NOELLE	Hey! Sorry about that. John, I see you met Mark.

MARK	Well, hello, don't you look beautiful?

NOELLE	Hello.

NOELLE	So, what are we...what are we talking about?

MARK	Oh, we're just talking about play-off scenarios.

NOELLE	Oh, great! Football, I love...I love football.

MARK	Yeah, you know what, John? Here, take one of my cards 'cause you never know when Reid's Candies is looking for a fresh take. And hopefully, I'll be printing some up for you, Noelle.

NOELLE	Hmm?

MARK	You have a chance to decide yet?

JOHN	Decision?

MARK	Yeah, John, come on. You got to convince her to come and work for my new design firm, okay? It's the opportunity of a lifetime!

JOHN	Sounds promising.

MARK	Exactly, but meanwhile she's got me sweating it while she's thinking about it. We just secured a very, very premium account, and she's undecided. Can you believe it?

JOHN	No, I can't.

MARK	Yeah, well, you know, I'm not gonna let you be the one to get away twice. I mean, professionally this time.

NOELLE	Mark!

MARK	I know that we have a past, okay, but it's all water under the bridge.

NOELLE	It is, way under the bridge.

MARK	So, John, can you please convince her to forgive me so that she doesn't pass up this dream job?

JOHN	I'll do my best.

MARK	Thank you, man. I'm gonna go mingle.

NOELLE	Great!

JOHN	(sighs) So that's ex-boyfriend Mark?

NOELLE	I... did not know that he was going to be here.

JOHN	I did not know that he offered you a job.

NOELLE	Honestly, it just happened, and I never know if I can take him seriously. Mark, he's kind of a show-off, and…

JOHN	I didn't know I was going to have competition, especially with your ex-boyfriend.

NOELLE	Oh, you don't have any competition. I am committed to you. To, I mean, to Reid's Candies, obviously!

JOHN	It's okay. You know what, let's just have fun tonight, all right?

NOELLE	Yes, please!

JOHN	Come on!

JOHN	I had fun tonight.

NOELLE	Yeah, me too.

JOHN	Uh, Mark wants to take me out for a client dinner. He wants to wine and dine me.

NOELLE	You're not gonna go, are you?

JOHN	Jealous?

NOELLE	(laughing)

JOHN	I think that he'd be a perfect gentleman on the first date.

NOELLE	Mm, he's only after one thing.

JOHN	What's that?

NOELLE	Your cheque book.

JOHN	Really? 

JOHN	Well, I already have a designer in mind, and the second-best will not do.

NOELLE	No.

JOHN	Okay, I will call you tomorrow.

NOELLE	Mmhmm 

JOHN	Uh, and hopefully with good news.

NOELLE	Right!

JOHN	Wish me luck!

NOELLE	Good luck.

NOELLE	Good night. 

JOHN	Good night.

JOHN	These windows, they've created a social media storm.

JOHN	As a result, this stand-alone store has outperformed our Times Square location. 

JOHN	We need to capitalize on this momentum and create a company-wide

JOHN	window display. Let's finish strong this Christmas, and implement a plan

JOHN	for every major holiday next year.

ARTHUR	All right, shall we vote?

ARTHUR	All for an immediate Christmas Eve window display?

ARTHUR	It's settled. Good job. Well done, John. All right, let's hire a design team ASAP.

JOHN	I have someone on deck. Noelle Bailey. It was her vision that set off this whole firestorm.

ARTHUR	Well, I appreciate her vision but a business this size requires a professional team with experience, 'cause we got to have a quick turnaround.

JOHN	Noelle has experience.

ARTHUR	Leave this to the professionals, son. I'll get our marketing team started on this. Meeting adjourned.

JOHN	Dad!

JOHN	Dad?

ARTHUR	Yeah.

JOHN	I want you to let me lead on the windows. It's my project, and I want these designs.

ARTHUR	Well, it's too late. We hired a professional firm the second the meeting was over. They've already sent over the prototypes.

ARTHUR	So, what do you think?

JOHN	Come on, look at these. These lack the character that Noelle's windows have. There's no personality. You see any Christmas spirit?

ARTHUR	Look, I don't know how many times I got to say this to you. The girl is a hometown decorator, and we have got to have a professional team on this. And I'll tell you what, if you want to continue with this window idea, then those are my terms. How do you like that?

JOHN	You're right, Dad. We all need to live by our own terms.

ARTHUR	Thanks.

JOHN	Thanks for that.

ASSISTANT	Mr. Reid, marketing needs the approved prototypes for the windows.

ARTHUR	Um, yeah, they're...the binder's on the table.

JOHN	Hello?...Yeah, speaking.

NOELLE	(into phone): How'd it go?

JOHN	Hey, um --

NOELLE	(into phone) They didn't go for it.

JOHN	No, look…

JOHN	…I gave it all I good but it's not happening. 

NOELLE	(into phone) That's fine, I...I really appreciate it.

JOHN	But you know what, do not let this make you give up on your dreams. You got to be designing, and, well, even if it's with Mark.

NOELLE	(into phone) Oh, no, I don't --I don't think that I could ever trust him again.

JOHN	What did you tell me? Go with your gut, right? You're truly an inspiration, you have to. Look, I should be thanking you.

NOELLE	(into phone) Thanking me?

JOHN	It's not official yet, so I can't really say too much, but seeing how you set your goals and the way you didn't compromise on your vision, well, that's true inspiration. That's made me rethink everything. 

NOELLE	(into phone):Wow. I can't wait to hear all about it.

JOHN	You'll be the first! Um, so we're on for cocoa tomorrow, right?

NOELLE	(into phone) Absolutely. Yes.

JOHN	All right, I'll see you then.

JOHN	Taxi!!

NOELLE	(into phone): Ugh. Hi, Grandma! You must be out Christmas shopping. Anyways, just thinking about you and sending lots of love. I'll talk to you soon.

NOELLE	Hey!

ALLISON	Don't freak out.

NOELLE	I hate it when you say that.

NOELLE	What?

ALLISON	That is your design, right? The shoes?

NOELLE	But-but he said that they passed on it. (crying) Well, I guess he used them, anyway. Wow. Oh, and of course, of course these are the shoes that I'm wearing, right? 'Cause these are the shoes I wore when Mark lied to me, and then, stole my designs, and then, broke my heart. And now, John lied to me, stole my designs... This is what I was afraid of, Allison. (crying)

ALLISON	What are you doing?

NOELLE	You know what, these shoes, they're not magic, okay? They're cursed!

ALLISON	Don't say that, you love your Christmas shoes!

NOELLE	Not anymore!

ALLISON	Noelle!!

NOELLE	All they've done is cause me heartache and headache, and I'm through with them.

ALLISON	Wait, hold on. Okay, you're making me nervous. What are you doing?

NOELLE	Take these with you when you go.

ALLISON	And do what with it?

NOELLE	I don't care, I don't care. You can trash it. You can donate it, I don't care. See you tomorrow.

ALLISON	(sighing)

NOELLE	(reading) "Every cloud has a silver lining. My memory of you dancing in my shoes will always brighten my day."

NOELLE	(sighing) Okay, fine. Find me my silver lining.

JOHN	For you, Madame.

NOELLE	Thank you.

JOHN	Wow, look at those shoes. Are they part of the Christmas collection?

NOELLE	Uh, yes, they are. These are the first shoes that my grandmother wore for her first Christmas in America.

NOELLE	When I was a little girl, I would teeter around in them, and then, when I was of age, she gave them to me.

JOHN	Wow, that's sweet.

NOELLE	Isn't it?

JOHN	Yeah. 

NOELLE	Maybe you should build a window around them.

JOHN	Yeah, like, uh...like a silver bells theme.

NOELLE	Yeah.

JOHN	So, you gonna take that job offer from Mark?

NOELLE	I don't know. You know, fool me once, it's a risk.

JOHN	Yeah, no risk, no reward.

NOELLE	Seems to be working for you.

JOHN	I know, I know, right? I can't believe how things turned out. I am so grateful, and I have you to thank for the inspiration.

NOELLE	Okay, don't, because gratitude is not going to make this better.

JOHN	Oh, did I do something wrong?

NOELLE	Did you really think that I wouldn't find out? But I'm so glad that I'm the source of inspiration for you.

JOHN	Yeah, okay, look, because of you, I finally have a job that I'm excited about. I can finally be creative.

NOELLE	Okay, wait...So, that's what all this was about, is you finding your dream job?

JOHN	No, no, of course not. Where are you going?

NOELLE	You know, I'm going --I'm going home.

JOHN	Why?

NOELLE	Because I know how this ends. You get the success, and I get a broken heart, and I'm not going to let you ruin my Christmas. So, best wishes with your new life, and you can stay out of mine.

NOELLE	(yelping)

JOHN	Oh! Hey. Just let me help you.

NOELLE	Oh, no!

NOELLE	You know what, don't, okay? You've done enough.

JOHN	(exhaling) 

ALLISON	Oh, man. Here. Better to be full of wine, than despair.

NOELLE	There's not enough wine in the world for that. Plus, you know, we do have to go back to work at some point.

ALLISON	It's not like we haven't done it before! So, are you really stepping back into your safety zone?

NOELLE	I don't know, I don't know, Allison. It just, it felt so good creating all those windows with John. You know, it (stammering) - it changed me. But when my last design career crashed and burned, I vowed to myself that I would never, ever again believe in Christmas magic and in dreams and relationships.

ALLISON	But you did, and I'm so glad you did. Being a dreamer suits you.

NOELLE	It felt like I was being swept into this...holiday fantasy. You know, after all these years, I was finally stepping into this Christmas dream that my grandma, she believed in so much. And then, reality set in and I woke up, and realized that no, I was just falling back into old patterns.

ALLISON	Yeah, well, at least you got some fabulous shoes out of it. That's a silver lining.

NOELLE	I guess that's true, if I hadn't asked you to throw a good portion of them out last night.

ALLISON	About that…(clears throat)

NOELLE	(whispering) Stupid…

NOELLE	What are you doing? 

ALLISON	(laughs)

NOELLE	No, you didn't!

ALLISON	(laughing) good or bad, they shaped your life. They helped make you into an amazing woman and my best friend. Plus, they're way too spectacular to trash.

NOELLE	You!

NOELLE	Here is a toast to spectacular shoes, and an amazing friend.

NOELLE	Thank you, thank you, thank you.

ALLISON	Well, since we're celebrating, um, can I try on those vintage red pumps?

NOELLE	Knock yourself out.

ALLISON	Yes!

ALLISON	Oh, yeah! You know, you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for these shoes.

NOELLE	What do you mean?

ALLISON	Ah! I mean, your grandparents met because of these shoes. Look at these!

NOELLE	They are a confidence-booster, I'll give them that.

ALLISON	I feel like I can do anything in these shoes!

NOELLE	That's it.

ALLISON	What?

NOELLE	That is what my grandmother, she's been trying to tell me all these years. It was never about the shoes. Allison, the magic, it's inside of us, and the shoes, they just boost whatever's there already.

ALLISON	I like that philosophy much better.

NOELLE	Right?

ALLISON	(laughs) But what are you going to do now?

NOELLE	Ugh!

ALLISON	John was right about this place. This cocoa is delicious.

NOELLE	A little help, please?

ALLISON	Why did you throw it in the garbage again?

NOELLE	Because I was... I was mad and impulsive.

ALLISON	How theatrical, I love it.

NOELLE	Ah, bingo!

ALLISON	Here.

NOELLE	Thank you.

ALLISON	What's wrong?

NOELLE	Oh, no. (reading poster) "The art center's new executive director."

ALLISON	Huh... well, that explains things.

NOELLE	Huh. This is, this is the surprise that he was talking about. What have I done?

NOELLE	Allison, how do I fix this? How do I fix this?

ALLISON	Well, what does your heart tell you to do?

NOELLE	I think my heart wants John. And I can't let him go like this, and I just...I need to step it up.

ALLISON	(quiet laugh)...Mm-hmm.

NOELLE	Okay, I think I know what to do, but I'm gonna need your help.

ALLISON	Of course!

NOELLE	Okay. 

NOELLE	Okay, I talked to the store manager and he

NOELLE	agreed to let us have the show there.

ALLISON	How did you convince him to do it so early?

NOELLE	I may have told him that corporate asked me to throw a going-away party for John.

ALLISON	Noelle, you lied? It's Christmas!

NOELLE	Well, I think all this Christmas spirit is giving me the confidence to lie like the Dickens.

ALLISON	Well, confidence is everything. It's on, Operation Save Your Man!

MARK	Hey, I-I came as soon as you texted. 

MARK	Oh! They told me to wait here, so…

NOELLE	(clears throat) 

NOELLE	Of course.

MARK	Here I am.

ALLISON	Right, I'll...I'll give you your privacy.

MARK	I have a feeling this isn't going to be a Merry Christmas for me.

NOELLE	You know that I can't take your offer, not after everything that's happened.

MARK	Yeah, well, I had to try.

NOELLE	I do appreciate your offer, I do.

MARK	I just don't want you to hate me, you know? Look, I made some mistakes, and I...I just never wanted to hurt you, I hope you know that. Things happened, and I just wasn't clever enough to change the course.

NOELLE	I don't hate you. I mean, how could I? That whole situation, it taught me a lot of lessons.

MARK	You deserve the best, Noelle.

NOELLE	Thank you.

MARK	I expect big things from you.

NOELLE	Me too.

NOELLE	Me too.

ALLISON	How did you get all of these paintings here without him knowing?

NOELLE	Well, I talked to the parent advisory board, and they agreed to have them delivered.

NOELLE	Hi there, sorry to interrupt. I'm just looking for Mr. Reid?

ASSISTANT	Do you have an appointment?

NOELLE	Uh, no, I don't.

ASSISTANT	Oh, it's Christmas Eve, and I know he wants to leave early. We could set something up for after the holidays.

NOELLE	Yeah, that's-that's not gonna work.

NOELLE	Mr. Reid!

ARTHUR	It's Noelle, right?

NOELLE	Yes, good to see you.

ARTHUR	Yeah, well, if you're looking for John, he doesn't work here anymore.

NOELLE	I'm... I am aware of that. Um, I'm actually here to talk to you. You know, people, they wake up every day wanting to change their lives, to live their passion, and most people, they don't follow through with that, but John, John, he did, and I really think that you should be proud of him.

ARTHUR	That's a hobby. This? This is a legacy.

NOELLE	And with all due respect, sir, what he is leaving for those children, that is going to be John's legacy.

NOELLE	I...Did you know that my parents, they got engaged at your store, and it changed their lives. It changed my life, don't you see? And what John is doing for those children, it's changing their lives. I mean, it would be so easy for John just to be safe and easy here, but he's not because...because it's not what makes him truly happy. And at the end of the day, isn't that what's important? What makes us happy? I think that you should let him be that incredible artist and teacher that he is. And if you, if you still have doubts, maybe this will change your mind. Merry Christmas, Mr. Reid.

NOELLE	Okay, I don't want to be greedy, but if there's any magic left in you, please, please, please, please give me my wish, okay?

NOELLE	(whispering inaudibly)

NOELLE	(to unseen party guest) Hi! Merry Christmas!

ALLISON	This is such a great turn-out. Everyone loves your window display.

NOELLE	(laughs)

ALLISON	Hey, it's gonna be okay. It's Christmas, everything will be just fine.

NOELLE	I just, I really think that I blew it.

ALLISON	What? Do you see these kids? This is their best Christmas ever.

NOELLE	Um. He's here.

ALLISON	Well! Go to him!

NOELLE	Hi.

JOHN	Hi.

NOELLE	You came.

JOHN	Of course. I got your invitation, and I can't say no to the kids. And besides, it's part of my new job.

NOELLE	Look, John, I didn't know. I saw Reid's using my ideas without me, and I...I just jumped to conclusions.

JOHN	There's no way that I'd steal your ideas. That's-that's not who I am.

NOELLE	I know that, I do, and I...and I knew it then, but I just...I got stuck in the past, and the fear, and...I'm so sorry.

JOHN	It's okay. I understand.


NOELLE	You do?

JOHN	Yeah, and I did a little digging too. I found out that an assistant sent your ideas to marketing. It was just a complete mix-up. So, before I leave, I will make sure you're fairly compensated.

NOELLE	Oh, I mean, that's not why...I'm doing all this.

JOHN	Why did you do this?

NOELLE	I did it for you. I mean, I honestly didn't...I didn't know if you were going to talk to me again, and I needed you to know how much you inspire me. And...how you've restored my faith in magic.

JOHN	How did I do that?

NOELLE	Well, for starters, you showed up. And that made me believe that all is not lost.

JOHN	It's not.

GEORGIA	Hi, Mr. Reid!

JOHN	We should probably go in.

NOELLE	Yes, yes, we should.

NOELLE	Hey, everybody, look who's here!

GEORGIA	Mr. Reid's here!

JOHN	Merry Christmas!

ALLISON	Merry Christmas!

ALLISON	Um, let me take your jacket.

NOELLE	(laughing)

JOHN	This is amazing.

NOELLE	Thank you!

JOHN	Are those the shoes that started it all?

NOELLE	Yes, my grandmother, she took her first steps into her new life in these. And maybe I can, too.

ARTHUR	Is there anything I can help with?

NOELLE	Uh, Mr. Reid.

JOHN	Dad.

ARTHUR	This is...it's maybe better than I expected.

JOHN	Yeah, probably record sales.

ARTHUR	That's not what I meant. I meant the kids, and...and the art. Son, I am so sorry for the way I spoke to you. 

ARTHUR	I just want you to know that I am so proud of you. You're living your dream, and you're happy. And that's all that really matters, right?

ARTHUR	And you, young lady, my son was right about you. Why don't you come and work for me? Head designer at all Reid's locations.

NOELLE	Um. What?!

NOELLE	All?? (to John) Really?

JOHN	Wow.

NOELLE	Um...I think I'm ready to step into my future. Thank you so much, Mr. Reid.

ARTHUR	I love you, son.

JOHN	I love you too, dad.

SANTA	Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

JOHN	You got Santa Claus, on Christmas Eve?

NOELLE	Hey, anything's possible. All you have to do is believe.

JOHN	Okay, come with me.

NOELLE	What? 

JOHN	It's kind of corny, but...Merry Christmas.

JOHN	Is that okay?

NOELLE	Yeah, this just makes me really, really happy, because it reminds me that romance is still very much alive and well.

NOELLE	Especially at Christmas.
