MRS. VEDA	Mark, I see belt loops and no belt.

MRS. VEDA	Oh, oh, oh… No.

MRS. VEDA	Ah, ah, ah. Miss O’Donnell. Just as I suspected: over two-and- a-half inches above the knee. Dean’s Office. Now!
ALICE	Good morning Mrs.Veda.

MRS. VEDA	Alice.

MRS. VEDA	School mass today at 2. Why don’t you be gift bearer again?

ALICE	Sure.

MRS. VEDA	Hmm.

FATHER MURPHY	OK, it’s like this.

FATHER MURPHY	Guys are like microwave ovens. And ladies are like... conventional ovens. Guys only need a few seconds, you know like a microwave, to get...switched on. While ladies, they typically need to, preheat for awhile. But God created sex with boundaries and for a purpose. Does anyone wanna take a stab at what the boundary is… Yes, Wade?

WADE	Marriage.

FATHER MURPHY	Very good.

FATHER MURPHY	And does anybody know the purpose?

HEATHER	To have children.

FATHER MURPHY	Perfecto. When a man and a woman receive the sacrament of matrimony, God calls on them to create children in his image.

FATHER MURPHY	Any sex outside of one man, one woman, one marriage is against God’s plan.

MALE STUDENT	Um, what about sex with yourself?

FATHER MURPHY	Can you create children from sex with yourself?

HEATHER	No.

FATHER MURPHY	 Right, so?

HEATHER	It’s against God’s plan.

FATHER MURPHY	 Exactly.

MALE STUDENT #2	So, is that what the Bible means by “spilling your seed?”

MALE STUDENT #2	Is it spilling if you catch it?

FATHER MURPHY	All right, all right. We are called on to be chaste until we’re married. That means no sex with yourself or anyone else – until you stand at that altar and you say “I do” or else it is damnation for all eternity. And remember, God is always watching…Capiche?

LAURA	They gave us Baby-Think-It-Overs in Christian Lifestyles.

LAURA	I’m not even having sex, they should just give them to the slutty girls.

ALICE	Oh, have you had to watch the partial- birth abortion video yet?

ALICE	It’s really awful.

LAURA	No, no! Don’t ruin it for me.

LAURA	How was Morality?

ALICE	It was fine… Did you know that masturbating is a sin?

LAURA	Eew! Of course. Why?

ALICE	I was just wondering.

LAURA	Making me rewind Titanic back to the car scene twice is probably also a sin, just in case you were wondering that next.

ALICE	Look, I only asked you to do that because I couldn’t hear what Kate whispered to Leo when he said, “Where to Miss”?

LAURA	Mhmm. Which just happens to be right before they make out and steam up that car window that Kate slaps her hand on.

ALICE	I didn’t write it!

ALICE	Hey! Hi Gus.

DAD	The Millers invited us over to watch the game.

MOM	 Great, I’ll make my cheesy potatoes.

MOM	Oh, Dammit, Ron. Now I’m all wet!

DAD	Calm down, Gail, you’re not that wet.

ANTHONY	So, uh, Alice, I heard you got on Wade Friday night.

LAURA	Stephanie told me she walked in on you guys in my sauna.

ANTHONY	Ohhhh! Gettin’ steamy in the sauna!

ALICE	No, we were just back there getting some drinks. We were only gone for like a minute!

ANTHONY	Yeah, that’s long enough for Wade. I was just messin’!

LAURA	Listen.You don’t have to put out just because you like a boy.

ALICE	I don’t like him.

FATHER MURPHY	And now, for the Bible passages that back all this up...We’re going start with Galatians. Heather, why don’t you start us off.

HEATHER	The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery…

ANTHONY	OK, so, I just bought this Blink 182 CD from Sam Goody, right? Uh, I upload into my computer and then I just put them on here. Easy as pie. The album’s amazing, by the way. It’s called Enema of the State. Get it? I bet you know all about enemas, don’t you?

LAURA	Can you not talk about enemas near my baby please?

ANTHONY	Yeah, I’m gonna…

LAURA	Thank you.

LAURA	Such a perv.

ALICE	What’s an enema?

LAURA	It’s when you fall water skiing and water shoots up your butt.

LAURA	Well, look who it is. Where were you this weekend? You didn’t come to my party.

BETH	Yeah, I heard things got pretty crazy. Everyone’s been talking about you and Wade.

ALICE	Oh?

BETH	Yeah. They’re saying you tossed his salad.

ALICE	What?

LAURA	Gross!

LAURA	You tossed his salad in my sauna?

ALICE	What? No! No! Who, who said that?

BETH	Some girl in my Geometry class was telling a bunch of us. Heather’s really pissed too. She just gave Wade a promise bracelet.

ALICE	OK. I mean, I’ve never even heard of dressing someone’s salad! So…

LAURA	The party was really fun... Why didn’t you come?

BETH	I was on a retreat.

LAURA	Oh! Like a spa?

BETH	No, a retreat run by the school. It’s called Kirkos and I got this necklace on it. See?

LAURA	Cool. What’d you do there?

BETH	We’re not allowed to talk about it with anyone who hasn’t been. But it totally changed my life.

NINA	Coming, Beth?

BETH	Yea. I gotta go.

BETH	You guys should sign up for the next one. I think it’d be good for you.

LAURA	Since when does Beth eat lunch with Nina and those girls? I have to go on that retreat.

ALICE	Do you think she thinks that I actually tasted Wade’s salad or whatever?

LAURA	I don’t know. Beth’s such a moron. I never have any clue what’s she’s talking about so she probably made it up.

ALICE	I’m gonna go get more milk.

ALICE	Oh, hey Heather, hey Wade.

ALICE	Can’t have pudding without milk!

HEATHER	She's disgusting.

MRS. VEDA	I think I’m going to ask Heather to bear the gifts with Jacob today.

MRS. VEDA	Alice, if you want to continue to be a gift bearer, you have to conduct yourself like one. Your body is a gift from God. You need to honor it.

ALICE	In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Bless me Father for I have sinned, it has been a week since my last confession. These are my sins… Talking back to my dad…Not helping my mom in the kitchen…Forgetting to feed the dog…And...

FATHER MURPHY	And anything else?

ALICE	That’s it.

FATHER MURPHY	For penance, why don’t you do the dishes for a week? Give your mom a break. And ten Hail Marys and ten Our Fathers. God, the Father of mercies, through the death and the resurrection of his Son, has reconciled the world to itself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins...

ALICE	Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us of our trespasses, as we forgive those who have trespassed against us…

MRS. VEDA	...your body is a gift from God….

HEATHER	…it’s against God’s plan…

MRS. VEDA	…you need to honor it…

FATHER MURPHY	…or else it is damnation for all eternity…

ALICE	…will be done on earth as it is in Heaven

BETH	it’s called Kirkos. I think it’d be good for you…

GOSPEL SONG	Michael row the boat ashore, hallelujah Michael row the boat ashore, hallelujah Sister help to trim the sails, hallelujah Sister help to trim the sails, Hallelujah

LAURA	Are we there? Michael row the boat ashore, hallelujah Michael row the boat ashore, hallelujah

ALICE	I can’t do this.

LAURA	These few days away are going to be good for us.
LAURA	Oh! Father looks so weird in regular people clothes.

LAURA	Oh my god! Nina's here! She must be one of the group leaders.

CHRIS	Hello everyone,

ALICE	Who’s that?

LAURA	Are you serious? That’s Chris. He’s only like the star of the football team.

CHRIS	Welcome to Kirkos. So you’re goIng to be in my cabin this week.

DAYDREAM SONG	My body's sayin' let's go Oh, oh, oh But my heart is sayin' no If you wanna be with me Baby, there's a price to pay I'm a genie in a bottle You gotta rub me the right way…

NINA	Hi! Alice, right?

ALICE	Yeah!

NINA	Welcome.

NINA	I’m Nina. Come with me. You’re in my cabin. Come on.

(GRAPHIC TITLE)	Question the First

NINA	I’m so excited for you guys.

NINA	OK. Find the room with your name on the door!

(GRAPHIC TITLE)	ALICE

NINA	Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you! You settling in? I’ve got a sweatshirt here for you.

ALICE	Thanks.

NINA	And... next order of bee’s wax is...I’m going to need your cell phone and or watch, if you have ‘em. Did you bring either one of those with you?

ALICE	Mhmm.

NINA	No phone?

ALICE	Uh-uh.

NINA	K. Don’t worry, you won’t be needing a watch this weekend anyway because you’re on Jesus’s time! See ya.

MRS. VEDA	Please find your small group number! Cut the chit-chat please and have a seat. Sit at the table with your small group number, please find your small group number.

ALICE	I guess I’ll see you later…

CHRIS	Group 1? Awesome!

CHRIS	I’m Chris, Group 1’s Senior Leader. Have a seat.

CHRIS	Group 1 too? Awesome! Have a seat.

FATHER MURPHY	You are here as part of God’s plan. His spirit moved each of you to sign up for this retreat, which is a unique experience that will challenge you in new and profound ways. Kirkos is a time to find meaning in the highs and lows of your life. Over these next four days you will hear from your classmates and be invited to open up as well. It will strengthen your relationship with yourself but, most importantly, with Jesus. Now let’s get started. On the paper that Mrs. Veda is handing out, you’re going to find a list of feelings. Go through them and circle any that you may have felt in the past year or so. There are no wrong answers. So just, just be honest.

FATHER MURPHY	…while ladies they typically need to, preheat for awhile…

FATHER MURPHY	OK. Let’s finish up.  Pass your papers toward the aisle. And make sure that your name is printed clearly on top.

FATHER MURPHY	The other night I dream that I was walking along the beach with the Lord. As we walked, scenes from my life flashed across the sky and in each scene, I noticed that there were footprints in the sand. In some scenes there were two sets of footprints and in other scenes there was only one set of footprints.

CHRIS	Hey.

ALICE	Hey.

CHRIS	Hey Sister Louise. Do you mind if I snag another stupendous Walking Taco?

SISTER LOUISE	Of course, dear. You’re a growing boy! And Walking Tacos have lots of protein and fiber.

CHRIS	May I have some sour cream too, please?

SISTER LOUISE	Oh, yes.

CHRIS	Thank you.

SISTER LOUISE	You’re welcome.

SISTER LOUISE	What about you dear?

ALICE	Oh, no, no thanks.

CHRIS	No sour cream? That is the best part.

ALICE	OK. Guess I’ll have some.

CHRIS	And how’s everything going for you so far, Alice?

ALICE	It’s great!

CHRIS	You know, it’s OK if you think things are totally weird. It’s supposed to be a little weird. At least at first. I’ll see you later Alice.

ALICE	OK, bye!

NINA	I come from a very big family. I have four younger siblings and...an older sister... Melissa. She made honor roll every semester and she founded Habitat for Humanity at our school. She’s the star of our family. One time, I came home at 2am 3 hours past my curfew. And no one even noticed. It felt like no one cared if I was there or not. I’d now like to play my first song.

(GRAPHIC TITLE)	My Empty Heart by Vanessica

SONG	You don’t notice me standing here Wishing you could somehow feel…

NINA	Last fall, Melissa came to pick me up from a friend’s house to take me home. And the next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital and being told that we’d been in an accident and that I had three broken ribs… And the first thought I had was... maybe my parents will finally start to notice me. Melissa was fine but… my parents were still obsessed with her and felt like they blamed me for the accident. That if she hadn’t had to come to pick me up, she would not have met her science bowl nationals. But then, I came on to this retreat, and I realized that God loves me…my friends love me…and…I love me too.

(GRAPHIC TITLE)	Weep the Second

FATHER MURPHY	OK guys, circle up, circle up. Now this is one of my favorite songs, and while you’re listening, I want you to imagine that the eyes in the song are Jesus’s eyes.

SONG	Love I get so lost, sometimes Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart When I want to run away…

SENIOR LEADER #	Would you look at how these gorgeous pines contrast against the blue sky?! Isn’t God’s paint palette just magnificent?

LAURA	So did I tell you 

NINA	me she liked my hair

LAURA	this morning at breakfast?

ALICE	Uh-huh

LAURA	Yeah. She said she can’t do with her own hair because every time she tries it her hair gets all bumpy. So I said I could show her how I do it and she said she would invite me over sometime! Isn’t that cool?

ALICE	Yeah.

LAURA	I mean, you could come too, of course, if you want. Well maybe I should ask Nina first if it’s OK that you’re there, but I mean… do you even want to come?

LAURA	Oh my god. Are you OK?

CHRIS/LAURA	Everything OK here troops? Whoa, comrade. That’s quite a battle wound.

ALICE	Uh huh.

CHRIS	Can you walk?

ALICE	No… no…

CHRIS	OK. Just don’t move.

CHRIS	Let’s get you to the nurse, huh?

SENIOR LEADER #2	Come on, everyone! They’ll be fine…

NINA	Hey. I was just coming to let you know we’re doing the group photo down by the bridge in five.

ALICE	Great! I’ll be there.

NINA	Everything OK in here?

ALICE	Yep.

NINA	OK…

NINA	What was that?

NINA	I specifically asked you for your phone on the day you arrived. Look, I’m going to have to tell Father about this.

FATHER MURPHY	Chris. Could you come in please?

MALE STUDENT #2	Hey Alice, what’d you have for breakfast?

ALICE	Cereal.

MALE STUDENT #2	You didn’t have... salad?

MALE STUDENT #2	Like a Wade salad.

FATHER MURPHY	OK. Everybody say Jesus Christ!

FATHER MURPHY	Jesus Christ!

FATHER MURPHY	Ok, great! Guys, head up toward the cafeteria. We’re going to have lunch in small groups today, OK? And Alice, Alice, a quick word. Nina said you kept your phone? You know, we have a reason for everything that we ask you to do here and it’s very important that you follow our rules.
ALICE	Sorry Father.

FATHER MURPHY	I hope you understand I can’t let this go unpunished.

SISTER LOUISE	Now first, you must empty the trash receptacles. There are four of them. One there... and one there... and one there...

NINA	What’s up?

ALICE	Just finished cleaning.

NINA	We made S’mores after lunch. Saved you one.

ALICE	Thanks.

NINA	We pretended each marshmallow was a different mortal sin before burning it. Yours was lust.

ALICE	Oh!

NINA	Look, I want you to know I’m not mad at you about the phone thing, OK? You’re doing a real good job and I think you’re on the right path now. So, just keep up the good work, OK?

ALICE	OK.

NINA	I believe in you.

FATHER MURPHY	Dear Andrew... Remember when you were little and mom and I would tuck you in, and you would make us kiss you on both of your cheeks at exactly the same time or else you couldn't fall asleep? I always thought those were my favorite memories from when we were a young family. But I was wrong. Every day is a new favorite memory with you. I love you, kiddo. Love, Dad.

MRS. VEDA	Dear Laura, Your father and I love you so much. And although I will always cherish those days when you were little, I love being able to do adult things with you too like getting our nails done and showing you how to cook my famous baked ziti. But no matter what, you’ll always be my baby girl. I love you so much.

FATHER MURPHY	Dear Alice, you’re a wonderful daughter and the best church partner a father could ask for. It’s so amazing to watch you grow into the wholesome young woman God created you to be. I am so proud of you for always making good choices. Love you, Al. Love, Dad

(GRAPHIC TITLE)	Accept the Third

CHRIS	…Amen.

ALICE /STUDENTS	Amen.

CHRIS	All right. Like myself and my fellow senior leaders have done, we are now going to ask that you all share your own stories. Moments when life was difficult, or hard, or overwhelming. Times where you felt Jesus was far away.

ANDREW	My girlfriend dumped me last week. That was really rough. I thought everything was going well, and last week she had her friend call me to break up with me for her. And I’m pretty sure it was a 3-way call, and she was listening so I acted like it was cool, but, it really sucked.
CHRIS	Thank you, Andrew.

GABBY	This is really hard to talk about, but... last month... my Grandma died. She lived in Idaho, so I didn’t see her that often. And like, it makes me really sad that we didn’t get to talk to her much before she died. The saddest part is... after her funeral we went back to her house and her dog was there, just looking so sad. It was like, walking around the house looking for her. It had no idea.

ALICE	Um…Well…speaking of dogs...My dog...Gus…died a few weeks ago. Um, our neighbors, put out some chipmunk poison… He must have got into it through the chain-link fence. My family was playing basketball in our driveway and the ball went over the fence, and I went to go get it, and… that’s where I found him, lying on his side, he wasn’t moving.


FATHER MURPHY	Excuse me! Can I have your attention please? All eyes and ears here. I’m sorry to report that earlier this morning I found something rather, disturbing on my office computer. It appears that someone has used it to engage in an online chat of…well, let’s just say... an explicit nature. Would anyone like to take responsibility for this?

FATHER MURPHY	I didn’t think so… Now, I have no way of knowing who did this, but whoever it was, even if I don’t know you did it, you do, and so does God. But in keeping with the theme of this retreat, I hope that whomever did do it feels compelled by the Spirit of Christ to come forward before the retreat is through.


FATHER MURPHY	So, Alice, how would you describe your relationship with Jesus?

ALICE	Fine.

FATHER MURPHY	Just fine?

ALICE	Fine as in good.

FATHER MURPHY	Do you think that there might be something getting in the way? Something that’s preventing it from being better?

FATHER MURPHY	OK, why don’t you try reflecting back on that feelings checklist you filled out on your first day here. Do any of the emotions that you circled on there bring anything up?

ALICE	Um, I was feeling envious of my best friend when she got a Beamer for her birthday because I drive a Buick Le Sabre.

FATHER MURPHY	Anything else?

ALICE	She also got Oakley sunglasses for Christmas.

FATHER MURPHY	What about feeling turned on?

FATHER MURPHY	No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear and he knows what is truly in your heart.


ALICE	OK.

FATHER MURPHY	So, have you ever felt turned on?

FATHER MURPHY	And did you take any action when you had that feeling? You didn’t take any action?

ALICE	No.

FATHER MURPHY	Nothing with your classmate Wade?

ALICE	No... someone made that up.

FATHER MURPHY	Alice, this retreat isn’t going to do you any favors if you’re not honest.

ALICE	How’s this?

CHRIS	Wow! That one’s huge. Way to go, Alice.

ALICE	Thanks.

NINA	And when you turn it “on” our plasma rises out of this little Oak unit. But when you press off, it sinks back down and a Rothko takes its place.

LAURA	Your rec room sounds amazing!

ADAM	Hey Nina,

ADAM	that, uh, leader meeting is about to start.

NINA	Right, right. I forgot about that. Thank you. I gotta go.

LAURA	OK. I’ll see you at the campfire!

ALICE	Hey!

WADE	What?

ALICE	What is your problem with me?

WADE	My problem? My problem is that Heather almost dumped me because of that disgusting rumor you started.

ALICE	I didn’t start it!

WADE	Yeah well, if you didn’t, who did?

ALICE	I don’t know! I…

ALICE	Did you start it?

WADE	No! I have a girlfriend!

ALICE	OK. Well, both you and I know that nothing happened. Are you telling people that?

ALICE	You need to start, because everyone thinks that I’m a slut, even the teachers. Look, you’re the only other person who knows what happened. And no one believes me!

FATHER MURPHY	Hey Wade! What are you still doing here?

WADE	Just on my way out, Father.

FATHER MURPHY	Good, good. How’s the old shotput arm doing in the off season?

WADE	Good, Father…

ALICE	I’m all done.

SISTER LOUISE	OK, dear.

LAURA	…the colorful floral tops?

NINA	With stripes…

LAURA	Yay…!

ALICE	Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute?

NINA	I’ll save you a seat.

LAURA	OK.

LAURA	What’s up? Nina asked me to sit with her so I don’t want to make her wait.

ALICE	I saw Nina giving Adam a blow job.

LAURA	What?!

ALICE	In the woods, after lunch.

LAURA	Why do you think it’s OK to keep making things up?

ALICE	I’m not making this up!

LAURA	Gabby told me you were talking about your dog dying in your small group?

LAURA	Did Gus die?

ALICE	OK, look,

ALICE	I just said that because… I didn’t know what to do! I didn’t have anything to say and everyone had these really sad stories...

LAURA	God, this is just like that time in sixth grade when you told everyone Jason gave you a “purple nurple” on the bus. You want attention.

ALICE	OK…

LAURA	You know what,

LAURA	I bet you actually did toss Wade’s salad.

ALICE	I don’t even know what that means!

LAURA	Oh my god. Quit the act. I know you know what it means just like you know the sex scene in Titanic comes right after they’re in the car. You were the one in Father’s office, weren’t you?

ALICE	What?

LAURA	It makes perfect sense and I am sick of constantly feeling embarrassed for being friends with a pervy psycho.

CHRIS	Alice, hey!

ALICE	Hey.

CHRIS	Is everything all right?

ALICE	Aaah…

CHRIS	Do you wanna talk?

CHRIS	Is everything OK? What are you doing?

CHRIS	What are you doing?! You know that I get turned on like a microwave!

ALL (singing)	Let us build the city of God May our tears be turned into dancing! For the Lord, our light and our love Has turned the night into day! Let us build the city of God May our tears be turned into dancing! For the Lord, our light and our love Has turned the night into day! Let us build the city of God…

ALICE	One wine cooler, please.

ALICE	Thanks.

GINA	Rough day?

GINA	You from that Catholic youth retreat down the road? 

ALICE	No. I’m twenty-one.

GINA	So what’s it like over there?

GINA	I used to be Catholic. I went to Catholic school for 12 years, was baptized, confirmed, the whole kit ‘n caboodle.

ALICE	You’re not anymore?

GINA	Noo.

ALICE	How come?

GINA	San Francisco... The 70s... Sex... Women. Lots of reasons. But I remember being your age and just being scared shitless that I was gonna wind up in hell.

ALICE	Really?

ALICE	For what?

GINA	Oh, god for everything! Cheating on my homework, for giving up sugar for Lent and then eating a whole jar of gumdrops underneath my grandmother’s staircase. I literally thought I was going to hell for eating gumdrops. And that there would be a big red devil there with a poker and he’d poke at me… and my bed would be made of coals and there’d be nothing but peas to eat because I hate peas.

ALICE	I thought I was gonna go to hell

ALICE	for rewinding Titanic back to the sex scene...three times.

GINA	You know, I thought I was gonna go to hell for looking through my dad’s Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition.

ALICE	I thought I was going to hell for having cybersex!

GINA	You know, the truth is, nobody knows what they’re doing anymore than the rest of us. We’re all just trying to figure out our shit. But be careful online, OK? Don’t give your password out to anyone, Not even someone who says they work for AOL. They don’t. They just want to give you the Melissa virus. Now, I’ve got to get you back to Jesus camp. I don’t want any nuns showing up in my bar looking for you. I know. Come on. I’ll give you a lift.

(GRAPHIC TITLE)	ST. IGNATIUS RETREAT CENTER

ALICE	Thanks.

GINA	No problem, kid.

GINA	Hey. Have you thought about where you might go to college?

ALICE	Probably State?

GINA	Why don’t you check out some schools on the east and west coasts. You might like getting outta this town for a bit.
ALICE	Wait! Do you know what… tossing someone’s salad is?

GINA	It means licking someone’s butthole.

GINA	Good luck out there, kid.

ALICE	Hey, how’s it going?

GLUE GIRL	I really miss my cat.

ALICE	What’s your cat’s name?

GLUE GIRL	Kyoto.

ALICE	Oh that’s pretty. What’s it mean?

GLUE GIRL	It’s a city is Japan. I love Japan! I’m going to go with my mom when I turn 18 as a graduation present...

ALICE	Cool. What are you going to do there?

GLUE GIRL	Try all the weird Japanese candy and eat a ton of sushi!

ALICE	I’ve never had sushi.

GLUE GIRL	Oh my god, it’s so good. We should go to Taki sometime. They have the best sushi.

ALICE	Yeah.

GLUE GIRL	In this city anyway.

LAURA	Hey.

ALICE	Hey.

LAURA	So, everyone says that it was Wade who used Father’s computer.

ALICE	Oh?

LAURA	Yeah.

LAURA	Father found his bracelet in his office or something. I’m sorry I thought it was you.

ALICE	It’s OK.

LAURA	Now that we know he’s a perv, he probably made up that rumor about you guys. He clearly made it up to hide the fact that he’s gay.

ALICE	What?

LAURA	Yeah, apparently whatever he did on Father’s computer was gay.

ALICE	But he has a girlfriend.

LAURA	Yeah, a girlfriend who doesn’t even kiss because she’s afraid it will lead to sex. The perfect cover up.

LAURA	Eew!

FATHER MURPHY	We have a mantra here at Kirkos. Question the First, Weep the Second, Accept the Third, Live the Fourth. It refers to the four days of Kirkos. Now, they’re all pretty self explanatory, except for that last one: Live. What that means is to take what you have learned this weekend, what you have discovered about yourself and incorporate it into your everyday lives. To live each day like it is the fourth day of Kirkos. Now, I’m going to ask that you come up here and speak about your experiences this weekend with the whole group. There’s no set order...just, let the spirit of Christ move you.

WADE	I, um...I gave in to temptation. This is not who I am, but I let myself lose control. This retreat has taught me though that, through the love of my friends, teachers, and most importantly, Jesus, that there is nothing I can’t overcome.


ALICE 	Being in high school sucks. People love to talk. But…just because you hear something doesn’t mean that it’s true. When people spread lies about you, it hurts. It makes you feel…alone…and empty…and…sometimes…you do things that you’re not proud of. But look, we’re all hiding stuff.
All kinds of stuff. What if we just try to be honest and treat each other with respect. That’s what Jesus wanted, right? And then, maybe, we can stop feeling so guilty about who we are all the time, because the truth is, we’re all just trying to figure out our shit…

ALICE	Sorry, um… OK.

ALICE	Have you ever had sushi?


DAD	Sushi? You mean like raw fish? No.

ALICE	Who are you going to go to church with when I go to college?

DAD	College! That’s not for 2 more years.

ALICE	A year and a half.

DAD	I don’t know.

DAD	Maybe I’ll start going to the late service again so your mom will come. Besides, State’s only 40 minutes away, you could come home on the weekends.

ALICE	Hey.

CHRIS	Hey.

ALICE	You don’t have to be scared of me.

CHRIS	I... I’m not scared of you...

ALICE	It won’t happen again. Friends?

CHRIS	Friends.

ALICE	Hug?

CHRIS	Side hug.

ALICE	Bless me Father for I have sinned,

ALICE	It has been a week since my last confession.

ALICE	These are my sins. Talking back to my parents...Not doing my chores...

FATHER MURPHY	Is that it?

ALICE	No. it’s something that happened on the retreat,

FATHER MURPHY	OK.

ALICE	I watched people having sex.

FATHER MURPHY	Alright.

ALICE	It was a video... there was a man and a woman...and the woman was wearing a hot pink bra…they were on the hood of a car...with graffiti on it...And…I did it even though I knew it was a sin. Will God still forgive me?

FATHER MURPHY	That’s between you and God. For penance, fifty Hail Mary’s and fifty Our Fathers.

JACK/ALICE	Where to, Miss?

ROSE/ALICE	To stars...
