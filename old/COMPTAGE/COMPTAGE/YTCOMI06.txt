STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends, Really Useful around the World!
STORYTELLER	Thomas visits the Canadian Rockies!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was hauling some tankers through the Rocky Mountains of Canada.

STORYTELLER	The trees he saw in the Redwood forest were bigger than any of the trees on Sodor.

STORYTELLER	Wow, said Thomas. 

STORYTELLER	The lakes were bigger too!

STORYTELLER	And the mountains were very high indeed. “Bust my buffers”, said Thomas nervously.
STORYTELLER	Then it started to snow. At first, there were just a few fluffy flakes...

STORYTELLER	...but then the snow got heavier and heavier!

STORYTELLER	“Cinders and ashes”, said Thomas.”This is too much for my little snow plough! I’m Stuck!”

STORYTELLER	And that’s when Thomas heard a strange noise! It sounded like a monster! A big, roaring monster. 

STORYTELLER	It had a big round mouth and spinning teeth. 

STORYTELLER	“Argh!” shouted Thomas. “The monster’s going to eat me too!”

STORYTELLER	“Hello!” said a friendly voice. “I can see you’re having a little trouble with the snow”

STORYTELLER	Thomas saw that it wasn’t a great big monster at all.  

STORYTELLER	“My name is Marshall. And this...is my rotary snow plough!”

STORYTELLER	“Fizzling fireboxes!” shouted Thomas. “That’s a big plough!”

STORYTELLER	“I know” said Marshall. “And it was invented right here in Canada! Especially for Canadian snow. Now, if you back on up a little, you can switch tracks – and finish your journey on the clear line!”

STORYTELLER	“How you doing back there?” shouted Marshall.

STORYTELLER	“Fine – thanks to you!” shouted Thomas.

STORYTELLER	And the two Really Useful engines went on their way – all the way through Rocky Mountain country!
