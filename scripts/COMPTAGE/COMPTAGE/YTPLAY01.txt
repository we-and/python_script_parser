(WILD WEST)
                  
THOMAS	Whoa, this isn't the Blue Mountain Quarry. Where am I? Wait a rooting-tooting minute, I must be in the Wild West! Wow! 

THOMAS	Howdy cows. How do you do? I mean, how do you moo? <laughs> 

THOMAS	Poor little fella. Don't worry, I'll help you! 

THOMAS	What are you doing here?

THOMAS	Oh no! I'm a wanted tank engine. Better get out of here before Sheriff Tophat sees me. 
THOMAS	Woah!

THOMAS	I think I might be on shaky ground! 

THOMAS	Phew. Hey! I'm Thomas. I'm going to take you back to your Mom. Hop aboard.

THOMAS	Uh-oh. Here goes! Whooooa!

THOMAS	Whoa. That was even steeper than Gordon's Hill! 
THOMAS	Cowboys…and divers!  Be brave Thomas! 

THOMAS	Sizzling cylinders, that was close! Let’s get you home.
 
THOMAS	You're very welcome. I’d better be getting back to my side of the tracks. See you in Sodor some time!
