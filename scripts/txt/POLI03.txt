polly	ok. three. two.

lila	wait! 

lila	there. perfection! 

polly	huh thanks, lila. 

polly	one. one. one.

polly	shani, that's your cue!

shani	are you sure you want to do this, polly?

polly	yes! think of it as a science experiment. now, go!

shani	okay, if it's for science

polly	wooooooooooooooooooooo!

polly	science fail

mr. quidnunc	who's making that ruckus!?

lila/shani	polly! it’s mr. quidnunc! get outta there! 

polly	go big! 

mr. quidnunc	hmph! trying to "ding-dong-ditch", is that it? the next time i see your parents, i'm telling them how ill-behaved you are, young lady! 

polly	but. oh boy

lila	hurry! i have rollercoaster fever and it can only be cured by riding the whopper whirler! 

shani	my assumption is that the real thing will be much safer. no offence polly.

polly	eh yeah. i guess my ride design could use some work.  

lila	ready to get ready? 

polly	yep! tiny power! 

lila	oh my walk-in closet!

lila	one wind-resistant, high-speed-proof 'do comingshani, no!

lila	fruity lip gloss is total faux pas! do you want a bug flying into your mouth when you're screaming at the top of your lungs as you plunge from the top of whopper whirler peak?

shani	did you say bugs? and screaming? and-and-and plunging?! no thanks! 

polly	can you believe mr. quidnunc thinks i’m ill-behaved? i know grandma said i’m supposed to use the locket to help but she didn’t say we can’t have a bit of fun along the way!

lila	i guess mr. q isn't a fan of fun. like the time with shani's cat

mr. quidnunc	aaagh!

polly	my hat! 

lila	and remember the time

polly	sorry! i hit my ball under here. 

mr quidnunc	polly!

lila	and who could possibly forget

polly	watch out! coming through! 

mr quidnunc	polly pocket! aah!

lila	and all the other times that we ended up crashing in on mr. q. 

polly	it's not like i want to hang around quidnunc's house. 

lila	uh who would? maj haunted vibes. 

polly	but it's like every time i use the locket

pierce	polly! you in there? 

polly	aah! code big brother! freeze! no, run! no stop!

pierce	what are you doing?

polly	uh hanging out in the closet. 

pierce	weird. mom said i had to give you guys a ride to wacky world. 

polly	actually, pierce, we have our own ride.

pierce	whatever, i’m over it. 

shani	there are approximately 473 reasons why that is unsafe, unsound and potentially illegal! 

polly	c'mon, shani! just enjoy the ride!

max	hey, isn't that your sister?

pierce	yeah. how did she? 

lila	there's the whopper whirler!

polly	the biggest, wildest, fastest coaster on the continent! 

weasel	mmf, mmf, mmf! 

gwen	what'd you say, gigi?

toddler	hee hee whackers! 

griselle	i said, there's polly pocket! 

griselle	i knew she wouldn't miss out on opening day of that rollercoaster. the screaming, the plunging, the bugs in your mouth! yuck! but at last, today, the locket shall be mine! 

gwen	yeah, then we're gonna shrink everyone in littleton and

griselle	put a cork in it, gwen! i can't have my own granddaughter ruining our secret plan!

griselle	now stay behind that. as long as she doesn't know we're here, we have the element of surprise!  

gwen	oooh! i love surprises! 

polly	three, please. 

ride operator	you gotta be this tall to ride. 

polly	but i'm almost

ride operator	don't worry, you can go on it... after you hit your growth spurt! now make way for real riders. 

lila	you should be ashamed of yourself, mister!

shani	because he ruined our day?

lila	ah no. because he's wearing the same ensemble as a bunch of people here. 

shani	that's a uniform.

lila	oh.

pierce	hey polly, maybe you're tall enough for the baby bumpers! have fun not getting in! 

lila	huh sigh. looks like my rollercoaster fever’s going uncured.

polly	it's okay, lila. we may not be riding this whopper whirler geni, scan rollercoaster. we're riding our own! 

lila	not to rain on your parade, but the last rollercoaster you built was a one-way ticket to splats-ville. 

polly	this one will be an exact, scale replica of the whopper whirler, just as safe as the real thing! 

geni	scanning complete. 

polly	geni, send rollercoaster to 3d printer. we'll be there soon! 

geni	as you wish, polly.

gwen	gigi! there's polly! 

griselle	the locket will be mine! 

kid	look! whackers weasel! whack him! 

polly	it's a painful job, but somebody's gotta do it. 

polly	whopper whirler-copy complete! tiny power!

shani	maybe i'll just observe. 

polly	shani, you're the one that sung in front of a boat load of people and helped stop griselle’s evil plan to shrink all of littleton! this bitty coaster is nothing compared to that.

shani	i guess you're right. it'll be fine. perfectly safe. what are you doing? 

lila	gotta keep it looking classy! you know, in case this is the end and they have to scrape little me off polly’s wall. i wanna look good!

polly	lila! it's fine. 

shani	that wasn’t so bad. let’s do it again!

polly	you got it! 

griselle	that pocket kid lives around here somewhere. 

griselle	destination in 100 feet. proceed to the route. 

griselle	i'm on the route! 

griselle	proceed to the route. 

griselle	huh? where? 

griselle	proceed to the route. 

griselle	grrr! good for nothing technology! 

gwen	yikes! haunted house! 

gwen	maybe polly lives there and ghosty-monsters gave her shrinking power!

griselle	don't be ridiculous. you know polly got the shrinking locket from her grandmother. 

gwen	oh, right. at least we don't have to go into the haunted house! 

griselle	it's gotta be one of these. 

shani	my head's spinning faster than an electrified electrons and my stomach flip-flopped so many times i can't tell if it's inside out or outside in
shani	i feel so alive! 

polly	again?

shani/lila	again!

polly/shani/lila	hahaha! aaaagh! 

lila	polly, what are you doing? this wind is beyond blowdryer speed and my hair’d not good past blowdryer speed. which reminds me! did i ever tell you about the time i bought the turbo straightener and my hair went like this! well, actually, it was more like this! 

shani	err ladies, hate to interrupt salon talk but we are about to be flatter than that last hairdo!

polly	oh right! go big, scarf! 

shani	phew! thanks, polly.

lila	thanks, fashion accessory! 

polly	well, it's was fun while it lasted. it's not fair that pierce gets to ride the whopper whirler all day

polly	pierce! the whopper whirler! we have to get to wacky world and warn them! 

shani	you're right! something bad could happen to the real whopper whirler! 

lila	whoa, whoa whoa! slow your roll, polka dot. just because ours broke doesn't mean the real one will. 

polly	it was an exact replica. flaws and all! go big!

polly	geni, determine weakness of rollercoaster. 

geni	flaw found. faulty tension screw on rail 64 c of quadrant q.  

polly	we have to save them!  

lila	but why us? the park has a safety inspector whose entire job is to make sure it's safe. 

polly	grandma said that the locket would show me ways to help. this is it! tiny power!

griselle	no phone, no gps, no map! how are we going to find pocket and that locket! granddarling. making tiny ar sound effects is not going to help find polly.

gwen	that’s not me making tiny car sound effects, that’s a tiny car making tiny car sound effects. 

polly	griselle grande!

shani	she must still be after the locket! 

lila	who wouldn't want an adorbs locket? 

polly	we don't have time to deal with them. we have to save the whopper whirler!

griselle	give me that locket! gwen…get off my back and get them!

gwen	okay!

shani	she’s gaining on us! 

gwen	h-h-haunted house!

shani	she's stopping! 


griselle	where is she?!

gwen	oh, she drove toward the haunted house and i ain’t going near a haunted house.

shani	we ditched em! 

polly	whacky world here we come! 


griselle	whacky world eh? then i’ll cut them off!

mr. quidnunc	hey! what are you doing on my

mr. quidnunc	hahahah

pierce/max	aaaaaagh! 

shani	phew! no sign of griselle or gwen.

griselle	hello, locket! goodbye, pocket!  

griselle	hahahah! huh?

polly	you guys distract griselle. i'll get them to shut down the whopper whirler. 

shani/lila	we shall come out of hiding now! / that appalling unfashionable woman is gone! 

griselle	there!  

polly	you have to shut down the ride! there's a loose screw!

ride operator	ha! the only thing here with a loose screw is you, kid. this part of some shorty-pants plan to get on the ride while i'm not looking? 

polly	no, i'm serious! the whole thing is gonna collapse!

ride operator	like i'm gonna believe a kid knows more about coasters than me? now scram, ding dong, or i'll call security. 

griselle	where did those rugrats go?

lila	now!

griselle	mmph! yuck! ew! 

gwen	mmm. tastes like pond! swampy!

polly	c'mon, grandma, pick up! i need you to call wacky world and tell them there's something wrong with the coaster. they won't believe me because i'm too

polly	he thinks i'm too little, but he underestimates how little i can be. tiny power! 

polly	there it is! rail 64c of quadrant q.

polly	oh no! 

griselle	hahahahah! gotcha, pipsqueaks!

griselle	hmph!

lila	shani, quick! in here!

shani	she’ll never be able to get us in here!

griselle	and why would that be? 

griselle	wait, where's polly?

lila	sorry, polly couldn't be here. you could say she had a whopper of a problem to take care of.

shani	lila!

griselle	whopper? 

shani	we have to get to polly before griselle does! 

griselle	come on! let’s get the pocket girl. ahhh this thing is seriously heavy!


shani	we gotta find the quadrant of the coaster with the faulty screw.

polly	yes! done and done!

shani/lila	polly! polly! griselle’s coming for you!

griselle	hahahah! can't escape me now, pocket! 

gwen	ooh, are we huntin' butterflies?

griselle	no, it's polly pocket season. 

shani	we have to get that net before that net gets polly!

lila	i know! emergency mani set!

shani	this isn't the time for nails

lila	clip-clip!

shani	if we snip the bottom off she won’t be able to stop polly from fixing the coaster!

shani	are we moving? 

polly	it’s not holding!

griselle	here i come polly pocket.

shani 	we need to snip faster!

griselle	i hate rollercoooooooassterrrs!

polly	oh no! griselle?!

lila/shani	polly! lookout!

griselle	hahaha! at last!

polly	if this coaster goes down, the whole amusement park could be toast! 

polly	here goes nothing! hold on, girls! 

griselle	noooo!

polly	shani, hold the zipline blaster. 

shani	polly, the coaster cars are almost here. we gotta do something. fast!

shani	polly! brilliant! the tensile strength of the strawberry squishy stuff was enough to secure the screw against the coaster’s vibrations.

lila	and now home time please. my hair cannot handle another loop-de-loop.

griselle	what the!?

gwen	weeeeeee!

shani/polly/lila	hee hee hee!

griselle	is it over? 

gwen	nope! we're riding again!

griselle	wait. what!?

pierce	it was a total rip off! they shut the whopper whirler just 'cuz apparently it was being held together by candy!

mom	polly and the girls didn’t mention that! seemed like they had the time of their lives. when they got back, they were still raring to go.

polly	ok team. you got the paint? 

lila	roger that!

shani	yep!

polly	i know grandma said to be careful not to shrink things that are too big but we have to make a big difference. we gotta move fast so nobody sees. ready?

shani/lila	ready!

mr. quidnunc	what the? ding dong ditching again? that’s it! where are you, polly pocket?

polly	okay. here we go! i hope this works! tiny power!

polly	go big!

mr. quidnunc	huh? all this commotion has my eyes playing tricks on me!

mr. quidnunc	mrs. pocket! i wanna have a word with you about your ill-behaved daughter!

polly	hi mr. q! hi mom!

mr. quidnunc	polly is one heck of a fine young lady. you should be proud of her!

mom	what was that about?

polly	who knows?

mr. quidnunc	you couldn’t have fixed the hole in the porch while you were at it?!

polly/shani lila	hahahaha!
