Sarah	Here we go. 

Sarah	That's two. 

Chris	Hey, 

Chris	there's so much fuchsia that they're unpacking back there. 

Chris	I think you might've over-ordered. 

Chris	This is gonna dent our bottom line. 

Sarah	Trust me, we'll use them. 

Sarah	There's a wedding coming up 

Sarah	and the bride wants something extra special. 

Chris	So as your accountant and adonis of a boyfriend, 

Chris	it's my job to just support your success? 

Chris	But occasionally you know, 

Chris	it might help to take a little advice 

Chris	especially if it's gotta do with the bottom line. 

Sarah	Bottom line? 

Sarah	Guess I'll sell them. 

Chris	They're at this new location. 

Chris	It's got you in over your head, you know? 

Chris	I'm tryin' to keep you afloat financially. 

Sarah	My life preserver. 

Sarah	Check this out. 

Chris	That is incredible. 

Chris	You kinda have a knack for this. 

Chris	Was this your first day? 

Sarah	My second. 

Sarah	But who's counting? 

Sarah	The phone's ringin' off the hook. 

Sarah	We will make this place a success. 

Chris	It's all you. 

Chris	You know, all I do is count the beans 

Chris	and whine about the bills. 

Sarah	The bills can wait. 

Sarah	Do me a fave? 

Chris	Yeah? 

Sarah	Will you supervise The guys in The back 

Sarah	and make sure they don't scuff 

Sarah	my brand-new tile floors again? 

Chris	you think It was them? 

Sarah	I have My hunches. 

Chris	You're having hunches now? 

Chris	Should I be worried? 

Chris	All right. 

Chris	What are you doing? 

Sarah	I can tell by The smell if the compost is ready. 

Chris	That smell's leakin' into the shop, Sarah. 

Chris	People are not gonna enjoy this in a flower shop. 

Sarah	Oh please, The flower shop smells like roses.

Chris	So we have dinner reservations at Mastro's

Chris	with a new client of mine 

Chris	and unfortunately we don't have time to shower.

Sarah	Compost is My eau de toilette. 

Chris	See, I prefer Chanel, you know? 

Chris	And then Tiffanys and then decomposing earth.

Sarah	I just found The biggest worm 

Sarah	literally the size of a pencil. 

Chris	Leave it. 

Chris	Don't

Sarah	Gotcha. 

Chris	Look at him. 

Chris	Don't be that girl. 

Chris	I'm gonna get it. 

Sarah	Where did you come from? 

Chris	Phone's for you! 

Chris	Phone! Okay.

Sarah	Hold that. 

Chris	Oh. 

Sarah	Hello? 

Sarah	Sarah speaking. 

Chris	It's like a Slinky. 

Sarah	Aunt Lilith? 

Sarah	I don't even know she was sick. 

Sarah	She's my mother's sister. 

Sarah	No, no. 

Sarah	My mother passed when I was young. 

Sarah	Really? 

Sarah	That's some news. 

Sarah	Everything? 

Sarah	Of course. 

Sarah	I understand. 

Sarah	Yes. 

Sarah	I'll be okay. 

Sarah	Thank you. 

Sarah	Bye. 

Sarah	Thanks. 

Chris	Lilith okay? 

Sarah	She passed away. 

Chris	I'm so sorry. 

Sarah	I got a letter from her last week 

Sarah	and she didn't even tell me she was sick. 

Chris	a letter? 

Sarah	She always sent handwritten letters.

Sarah	True love. 

Chris	you know, an all-caps email 

Chris	can also bring a lot of emotion outta that client.

Chris	Sorry. 

Sarah	After my mother passed, 

Sarah	I spent every summer at Lilith's ranch. 

Sarah	She was practically a second mom. 

Sarah	But then I went to college and things got busy

Sarah	and it became really hard to make time for her.

Chris	When's the funeral? 

Sarah	She asked not to have one. 

Sarah	Chris, she left me her 50-acre ranch. 

Chris	The entire ranch? 

Sarah	She donated her clothes and linens to a church

Sarah	and she gave her truck to a neighbor. 

Sarah	But the rest of her estate is mine. 

Sarah	I just wish I called her. 

Chris	What can I do to help? 

Sarah	Well I'll need you to watch the shop while I go up there.

Chris	I'd love to, but I'm an accountant. 

Chris	I'm not a florist. 

Chris	I have clients, you know?

Chris	We're gonna be late. 

Chris	I'll tell them we can't make it. 

Chris	But takin' care of the shop, that is not my expertise.

Chris	I mean I like to help when I can. 

Sarah	Chris, I have to go. 

Chris	Why? What's there to see? 

Chris	Get in touch with an estate sales company. 

Chris	They take care of selling the whole thing remotely.

Chris	Problem solved. 

Chris	I'm tellin' you. 

Chris	Baby, your aunt has done something incredible for you.

Chris	You can finally get yourself outta debt. 

Sarah	And sell it? 

Sarah	Who says I'm gonna sell it? 

Chris	I'm just assuming. 

Chris	What the hell else are you gonna do 

Chris	with a ranch in the middle of nowhere? 

Sarah	I can't sell it without going there 

Sarah	and knowing exactly what she left me. 

Sarah	There are things there. 

Sarah	My mother's belongings, stuff from my childhood.

Sarah	I have to go. 

Chris	Okay, I'll take care of the flower shop. 

Chris	But look at me. 

Chris	I am the pinnacle of ignorance. 

Chris	I don't know the difference between a tulip and a Darwin.

Sarah	They're the same flower. 

Chris	So? 

Sarah	Don't touch the floral arrangements, okay?

Sarah	I know that won't end well. 

Sarah	I'll look on social media 

Sarah	and find someone to arrange while I'm gone.

Sarah	Thank you for understanding. 

Aunt Lilith	[Aunt Lilith] My dearest Sarah, 

Aunt Lilith	I do wish you had gotten to the ranch more.

Aunt Lilith	It's been much too long 

Aunt Lilith	and your soul could do with some country air.

Aunt Lilith	The crops are doing better than ever this year

Aunt Lilith	and there's butterflies everywhere. 

Aunt Lilith	They tickle my nose when I'm trying to weed.

Aunt Lilith	I think of the times when you were young 

Aunt Lilith	and came over to help me. 

Aunt Lilith	Those were some of the best days ever 

Aunt Lilith	and I look forward to the day 

Aunt Lilith	you walk through my front door once again. 

Sarah	Thank you. 

Sarah	Ooh, come on. 

Sarah	Kay. 

Sarah	 Okay, she never fixed that.

Sarah	Of course she didn't pay the power bill. 

Sarah	How could she? 

Sarah	Okay. 

Sarah	So no cell service, 

Sarah	no heat, 

Sarah	no lights, no TV. 

Sarah	Guess I'll sleep. 

Sarah	No sheets. 

Sarah	Where are all the sheets? 

Sarah	Thank you for the donations. 

Sarah	We all miss you. 

Sarah	Pastor Ed." 

Sarah	That's right. 

Sarah	Okay, I'm getting up. 

Sarah	Whoa. 

Hank	Are you all right? 

Sarah	all good. 

Sarah	This place is going on the chopping block 

Sarah	first thing tomorrow. 

Sarah	Okay. 

Sarah	Okay. 

Sarah	I'm awake. 

Sarah	Why so 

Sarah	early? 

Sarah	I was drooling. 

Sarah	Come on. 

Sarah	Gotta get service. 

Sarah	Come on, I gotta get service. 

Hank	The "Hokey Pokey's" not gonna help. 

Sarah	Well you never know. 

Sarah	Put your right foot in 

Hank	Lilith never had anything more than a landline.

Sarah	Oh. 

Sarah	Well then. 

Sarah	I'm Sarah Foster. 

Sarah	Lilith was my aunt. 

Sarah	Oh, I know. 

Sarah	They spoke about you often. 

Hank	I'm Hank. 

Hank	Hank Bright, your neighbor. 

Sarah	Oh yeah, She spoke about you too. 

Sarah	The name just slipped my mind. 

Hank	It's okay. 

Sarah	Hey, I have a question you might know the answer to.

Sarah	Which fields are mine? 

Sarah	I assume that green one there. 

Hank	That one is not yours. 

Sarah	That one over there is yours. 

Sarah	Oh. 

Sarah	Lilith would always send pictures 

Sarah	and everything was so green. 

Sarah	What happened? 

Hank	Scab got it. 

Sarah	That's the oat blight, right? 

Hank	you know an awful lot about crops 

Sarah	for someone in designer shoes. 

Sarah	Well I have a major in botany, minor in fashion.

Hank	Oh, So you dress flowers. 

Sarah	Sort of, yeah. 

Sarah	I run a flower shop. 

Hank	I have a deep appreciation for flowers 

Hank	or at least my bees do. 

Sarah	Oh, you're a beekeeper. 

Hank	Mm-hmm. 

Sarah	So That was you last night. 

Hank	So That was you last night. 

Sarah	That was me. 

Hank	Well I've had a problem with the scabs since last spring.

Hank	I wouldn't plant any type of cereal to be safe.

Hank	No oat, grain, wheat. 

Sarah	But the soil, it's still fertile, right? 

Hank	Oh yeah, very fertile. 

Hank	Lilith made sure of that. 

Hank	She had soil shipped in from outta state. 

Sarah	That'd be expensive. 

Hank	Lilith spared no expense when it came to her land.

Sarah	Huh. 

Sarah	Well thank you. 

Sarah	I appreciate it. 

Sarah	I have to have the place assessed so I can sell it.

Hank	Not stickin' around? 

Sarah	no, I have That flower shop in Los Angeles

Sarah	and a boyfriend who's all thumbs and none of them are green.

Hank	Well I'm sure someone'll buy it in a year or two.

Sarah	a year? 

Sarah	Why so long? 

Hank	The ranch has been on The market for the last two years.

Hank	I think she had one offer, 

Hank	but it wasn't even worth what half land's worth

Hank	not to mention the home. 

Sarah	Why So low? 

Hank	Scab. 

Hank	Well this isn't Los Angeles. 

Hank	You have to wanna live way out here and not many people do.

Sarah	I get that. 

Sarah	Sorry. 

Sarah	I just meant it's really isolated. 

Hank	It can grow on you. 

Hank	I'm right over there. 

Hank	So if you ever need anythin', 

Hank	then you know where to find me. 

Sarah	Great. 

Sarah	Well it was great meeting you. 

Sarah	I'm sorry, what's your name again? 

Hank	Hank. 

Sarah	Hank. 

Sarah	Right. 

Hank	See you around, Sarah. 

Sarah	See ya. 

Sarah	Whoa.

Sarah	I have a boyfriend. 

Chris	"Arrangement that inspires eternal love and happiness

Chris	for the wedding of Shay and Darby. 

Chris	20 of 'em, each unique yet complimentary." 

Chris	All right. 

Chris	I don't want what you're hocking.

Sarah	I was lucky enough to find a pizza place that delivered.

Chris	She had like a real phone? 

Sarah	Cord and all. 

Chris	So What do you think? 

Chris	Can you sell the place? 

Sarah	Well Lilith put It up for sale when she got sick.

Sarah	She got one low-ball offer 

Sarah	that wouldn't even cover the agent fees. 

Sarah	I found her journal. 

Sarah	She wrote in this thing like every day. 

Sarah	Listen to this: "An oat blight killed my crops.

Sarah	I never saw it coming. 

Sarah	My plan is to replace the top soil with volcanic ash.

Sarah	And in a few months, I should be able to recede."

Sarah	Isn't that amazing? 

Chris	is this gonna help you sell The place? 

Sarah	no, not at all. 

Sarah	But I did think of something better. 

Chris	Better than selling? 

Chris	Pray tell. 

Sarah	It might involve me being away from the store

Sarah	a little bit longer. 

Sarah	How's the new help that I hired? 

Chris	Mariah? 

Chris	Mariah, she's... 

Chris	So what's this idea?

Sarah	And I'm gonna have to use the credit card.

Sarah	I need to buy a few things. 

Chris	You know my policy about credit. 

Sarah	I know, I know.

Sarah	"Today, I met my goddaughter and sweet baby niece

Sarah	Okay so now that I'm looking, 

Sarah	the similarities are obvious. 

Sarah	Not that you look feminine, Hank.

Sarah	and like the eyes.

Hank	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Alyssa	Yup, he's very pretty.

Lyle	Hey, how's it goin', folks? 

Hank	Wow, Hey. 

Hank	This here is Sarah Foster, 

Hank	Lilith's niece and proud new owner of the ranch.

Lyle	It's good to meet you. 

Lyle	You know, Lilith was a legend around here. 

Lyle	Hey Lloyd, come on over here and meet Sarah.

Lyle	She's movin' into Lilith's place. 

Sarah	Well just temporarily. 

Lloyd	Holy. 

Lloyd	Lilith said you were beautiful. 

Lloyd	But darn, she was right. 

Sarah	Great to meet you. 

Sarah	Thank you. 

Sarah	It's great to meet you too. 

Lloyd	So What can we do you for? 

Hank	She's in need of some seed, hibiscus. 

Sarah	Yes, please. 

Lyle	Hibiscus. 

Lloyd	yeah. 

Lyle	I don't think we've ever had hibiscus here before,

Lyle	have we? 

Lloyd	No, don't recall anything of that name. 

Lyle	Nothing? 

Lyle 	No. 

Lloyd	no.

Sarah	Well Lilith sent this to me after her trip to Hawaii.

Sarah	It's a hibiscus bloom. 

Sarah	They're not native to this part of America,

Sarah	but I was hoping to bring some in. 

Lyle	Hmm, interesting.

Lyle	Just write down the name and tell me how many you want

Lyle	and then I'll do my best and we'll see what happens, okay?

Hank 	May I? 

Lyle	Oh yeah.

Lyle	Well you know where it goes. 

Lyle	Oh, the sourwood flavor? 

Lyle	It's doin' great, by the way. 

Hank	Enjoy It while It lasts. 

Hank	Sourwood's almost outta season. 

Hank	And with less bees, consider it a diminishing resource.

Lyle	Is something killin' 'em? 

Hank	Dead crops mean Dead bees. 

Hank	This blight's takin' a toll on more than just the oats.

Lyle	Got it. 

Sarah 	 there you are.

Hank	Thank you.

Sarah	Thank you. 

Sarah	So what are you gonna do about the bees? 

Hank	It's not entirely up to me. 

Hank	It's also to do with what the farmers plant.

Hank	My bees have always thrived on canola. 

Hank	So here's hoping that's what we plant in the spring.

Lyle	We've had large orders of canola seed. 

Lloyd	And get rid of That Scab. 

Hank	Hey, you wanna try some honey? 

Hank	We got samples. 

Sarah	Sure. 

Alyssa	Allow me. 

Sarah	do I just use My finger? 

Hank	yeah. 

Hank	No, I'm kidding.

Hank	Here. 

Sarah	Thank you. 

Sarah	Kay. 

Sarah	Mmm. 

Sarah	That's really good. 

Sarah	Is that? 

Sarah	There's like a peppermint flavor. 

Sarah	What? 

Sarah	What's so funny? 

Alyssa	did you hear That, Lyle? 

Alyssa	There is a market for Hank's weird lab honey after all.

Lloyd	See, I told you. 

Sarah	Lab honey? 

Hank	I've been developing new ways to process the honey,

Hank	adding in essential oils 

Hank	which don't necessarily grow in the area. 

Hank	Like peppermint, for instance. 

Sarah	Hmm, well it's delicious. 

Hank	Alyssa's always been a little narrow-minded

Hank	when it comes to my creations 

Hank	or any changes to the honey for that matter.

Alyssa	I'm a purist. 

Hank	She's a purist. 

Alyssa	If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

Alyssa	And it's called liquid gold for a reason. 

Alyssa	We should get back to the ranch. 

Sarah	Okay, I'm just gonna grab a few things quick.

Sarah	Thanks. 

Alyssa	Would you like to keep this? 

Alyssa	Jeez. 

Mariah	So how Are we doing?

Sarah	Chris. 

Chris	Hey.

Chris	Yeah, I don't blame you. 

Chris	This place is a green. 

Chris	Why do I feel like those are one escape route

Chris	and now it's vanishing in the distance? 

Sarah	Haha, come on. 

Sarah	You came just in time. 

Sarah	The Richie brothers 

Sarah	just dropped off their first bag of seed, 

Sarah	so you get to help me plant. 

Chris	Plant? 

Chris	No one said anything about planting. 

Chris	Planting like with the hands and the shovels and the dirt?

Sarah	Welcome to Aunt Lilith's home. 

Sarah	When I got here, the power was out. 

Sarah	But I paid that 

Sarah	and some of the plants were a bit on the downside.

Sarah	But as you can see, 

Sarah	I nursed everybody back to health quite nicely.

Chris	I've not seen a TV like this in ever. 

Chris	I've never seen a TV like this. 

Sarah	I can get channel five if I stand like right here

Sarah	and do this. 

Chris	That's convenient. 

Sarah	Look at this. 

Sarah	See this? 

Sarah	This is all mine from this fence to this stream here.

Chris	You have a stream. 

Sarah	I don't know. 

Sarah	Technically it's a property line. 

Sarah	But these are my fields. 

Sarah	And what's cool about them 

Sarah	is when the scab started killing all the crops,

Sarah	Lilith paid to have volcanic ash tilled into the ground.

Chris	is That good? 

Sarah	It's great. 

Sarah	Hibiscus love volcanic ash 

Sarah	and the scab won't affect their growth. 

Chris	Hey, So did you get the internet working?

Chris	Cause I have to make a call. 

Sarah	Todd's the guy and Todd's fishing until next week.

Chris	Fishing 'til next week? 

Chris	Who goes fishing 'til next week?

Sarah	48 hours.

Sarah	You're fine. 

Chris	It's a gigantic chicken. 

Sarah	Okay, So we plant in straight rows. 

Sarah	Each seed goes in two inches deep and covered with soil.

Sarah	I figured I'll dig the holes if you wanna plant the seed.

Chris	Hokey smokes, you're the boss. 

Chris	Let's. 

Sarah	just keep an open mind. 

Sarah	I have a very open mind. 

Chris	Really? I have a gaping open mind.

Sarah	I'm gonna hold you to it. 

Sarah	This gate's funny.

Alyssa	That's heat rash. 

Chris	Oh, Oh. 

Chris	Oh, you're a doctor. 

Chris	Uh, Uh, uh. 

Alyssa	No, I have commonsense. 

Chris	I'm dead. 

Chris	I'm a deceased man. 

Hank	Take off your shirt. 

Sarah	Chris, just listen to him. 

Hank	Yeah, but that's not heat rash. 

Hank	It'sBugs.

Chris	They're under my skin. 

Chris	There's an insect egg sac under my skin. 

Chris	Oh yeah, this is why dirt is wrong. 

Hank	Look, it's hay fever, okay? 

Hank	You're allergic to the dirt in the air. 

Chris	Dirty air? 

Chris	I thought farm land was supposed to have 

Chris	the best air quality in the world. 

Chris	Get some fresh air, she said. 

Sarah	Who said that? 

Chris	Hmm? 

Chris	No one, not any one person. 

Sarah	Okay. 

Sarah	I better get him inside before he hyperventilates.

Chris	They stare at you like they know everything.

Chris	Is it heat rash? 

Chris	No, it's hay fever. 

Sarah	Hank Would know. 

Chris	What, is He a doctor now? 

Sarah	No, he's a beekeeper. 

Chris	That's even worse. 

Sarah	how is That worse? 

Chris	Cause bees. 

Chris	They sting you. 

Chris	If you get stung in the ear, 

Chris	your ear swells up to twice its size. 

Chris	Everyone on your little league baseball team

Chris	makes fun of you and Kaitlin doesn't dance with you

Chris	at the school dance. 

Chris	And bees are his friends. 

Sarah	You don't need a doctor. 

Sarah	You need a shrink. 

Chris	Can't stay here, Sarah. 

Sarah	You've been here for half a day. 

Chris	yeah And this place wants me dead. 

Chris	I'm sorry, I'm not a farmer. 

Chris	I'm not a butcher. 

Chris	I'm not a baker. 

Chris	I'm not a candlestick maker. 

Chris	I like the taste of a latte. 

Chris	I want a TV that's got more... 

Chris	Ow. 

Chris	That's got more than one channel on it. 

Sarah	I was gonna show you around town tomorrow.

Chris	Sarah, you can't expect me to stay somewhere

Chris	that literally hurts my skin. 

Chris	How 'bout the sooner we go home, 

Chris	the sooner we can resume our old lives? 

Chris	The one we're meant to have in a city. 

Chris	This will never be our home. 

Chris	Now why don't you just get somebody to hire somebody

Chris	to plant your flowers? 

Sarah	with What money? 

Sarah	Maxed out the credit card buying all the seed.

Chris	you what? 

Chris	Sarah. 

Chris	You have no savings. 

Sarah	Well Thanks for making me feel better. 

Chris	Make you feel better? 

Chris	I got things on my neck. 

Chris	Look, I know your flowers are gonna be a big success,

Chris	you know? 

Chris	Sales through the roof right outta debt. 

Chris	But I can't stay here. 

Chris	This ain't my lifestyle, baby. 

Sarah	Hank was right. 

Chris	It's not hay fever.

Sarah	Bless you. 

Chris	Thank you. 

Chris	Really feel better if you were gonna come with me.

Sarah	I gotta stay And See this through. 

Chris	I have morning breath. 

Chris	Andele. 

Chris	Hey Dave. 

Chris	Yeah, baby. 

Chris	I'm gonna be at the Links in two hours and counting.

Sarah	Hey. 

Hank	Don't move. 

Hank	I received a new queen this mornin' 

Hank	with four workers and they escaped. 

Sarah	I'll come back later. 

Hank	Wait, no. Don't go. 

Hank	They'll get out. 

Sarah	I can't stay. 

Sarah	They'll sting me. 

Hank	They won't, unless they sense your fear. 

Sarah	I am afraid. 

Hank	now think happy thoughts. 

Sarah	happy thoughts, Okay. 

Hank	Don't move a muscle. 

Sarah	Where is it? 

Hank	She's right there. 

Sarah	Next to me? 

Hank	on The window. 

Hank	Don't move. 

Hank	You might startle 'em. 

Hank	I'm gonna have to reach around you, 'kay? 

Sarah	just do it. 

Hank	Got 'er. 

Sarah	Whoa. 

Sarah	That's a queen bee? 

Hank	Yup, from Russia. 

Sarah	It's so much bigger than the worker bees.

Hank	We're starting a new hive. 

Hank	They came in the mail today. 

Sarah	you can receive queens in The mail? 

Hank	can pretty much order anything off the internet.

Sarah	Wait, you guys have Internet? 

Hank	Of course, who doesn't have internet? 

Sarah	Oh, come on. 

Sarah	I needed a connection for the last week. 

Hank	you never asked. 

Sarah	Beekeeper-5G, password's Nuc-nuc. 

Sarah	"The Three Stooges". 

Hank	No, it's a bee joke. 

Hank	N-U-C, N-U-C. 

Hank	Nuc-nuc. 

Sarah	Oh. 

Sarah	Very clever. 

Hank	So What you need? 

Sarah	Chris left And I need help planting. 

Hank	Okay, let's make a deal. 

Hank	You help me harvest the honey and I'll help you plant.

Sarah	I've never been stung by a bee before. 

Hank	Never? 

Sarah	My mom was allergic. 

Hank	hmm. 

Hank	Well lucky for you, 

Hank	I have an extra bee suit and an EpiPen. 

Hank	You'll be safe. 

Sarah	Okay. 

Sarah	Deal. 

Sarah	That looks like a marshmallow spacesuit. 

Hank	And you'll be glad to know this one's yours.

Hank	Suit up. 

Sarah	I just change right here? 

Hank	all right. 

Hank	You ready? 

Sarah	think so. 

Hank	So beehives Are made of four basic components.

Hank	This is the bottom ward. 

Hank	You can think of it as arrivals and departures.

Hank	The bees' landing pad. 

Hank	It seals the hive from the elements 

Hank	but also system ventilation. 

Hank	These are the deep supers for the brood, 

Hank	large hives for the bees to build wax. 

Hank	And this, this is the medium super 

Hank	where the honey's collected. 

Hank	So the honey's stored in frames instead of beeswax honeycomb

Hank	to make the extraction process easy. 

Hank	What we typically do is take a heated knife

Hank	to break the caps and spin the frames 

Hank	to collect the honey in a pail. 

Hank	The wax caps can then be collected and melted into candles.

Sarah	how do you not get stung? 

Hank	Oh, I get stung But not very often. 

Hank	The key's to handle with care. 

Hank	No quick movements. 

Hank	And if you do get stung, don't kill the bee.

Hank	The dead bee's pheromones'll create a swarm.

Hank	So you have to learn to be pretty patient 

Hank	and tolerate a little pain. 

Sarah	you must Be The most patient man in the world.

Hank	there She comes. 

Hank	Look at that. 

Hank	What d'you think? 

Hank	Pretty cool, right? 

Hank	Wanna give it a lick? 

Sarah	no. 

Hank	go on. 

Hank	They won't bite. no.

Hank	all right. 

Hank	Can you hold this for a sec? 

Hank	Uh-Huh. you got it.

Hank	Hey, look at that. 

Hank	She's a natural. 

(Song)	Oh you and I 

Hank	Wow. 

(Song)	We're strangers now 

Hank	Move that one there. 

Sarah	If you take this, 

hank 	I'm gonna be so mad. 

Sarah	I'm not, I'm not. I'm not.

Hank	I won't, I won't. 

Hank	You're not takin' this serious? 

Sarah	I am taking this serious. 

Hank	is that? 

(Song)	My heart 

Hank	what? 

Sarah	you moved something. 

Hank	I didn't, I didn't. 

Sarah	What did you move? 

Hank	I don't know what you're talkin' about. 

Sarah	Can't be trusted. 

Hank	I'll just go right here. 

(Song)	I'm gonna lay this 

(Song)	Out to dry 

(Song)	And rearrange all the pieces that I laid on the line 

(Song)	When I was caught in the downpour of 

(Song)	You and I 

(Song)	You and I 

Hank	It's tradition. 

(Song)	Lover, don't you understand 

(Song)	I'm not made a woman by another's hands §

(Song)	Oh you and I 

(Song)	We are strangers now 

Sarah	Hey babe, how's it going? 

Mariah	Not too bad, 

Mariah	though I don't normally go by babe. 

Sarah	Oh. 

Sarah	Sorry, Mariah. 

Mariah	no need to apologize. 

Mariah	So I was over here looking at the log books

Mariah	and it says that we should be expecting a shipment

Mariah	of your hibiscus flowers this week. 

Sarah	Yeah, I know it's time to harvest 

Sarah	and some of them have blossomed, 

Sarah	but it's just really hard to cut my babies down.

Mariah	Uh-Huh. 

Mariah	Okay. 

Mariah	Well do you think that we're gonna get them in on time

Mariah	or should I order from one of our more reliable vendors?

Sarah	no, no. 

Sarah	I'll get it done. 

Mariah	Great. 

Mariah	Good to hear. 

Mariah	Thanks, Sarah. 

Sarah	Wait, can you put 

Sarah	Chris on the phone? 

Sarah	Kay. 

Sarah	Here we go. 

Sarah	I'm so sorry. 

Sarah	Oh. 

Sarah	See? 

Sarah	Wasn't so bad. 

Sarah	Did great. 

Sarah	All right now, who's next? 

Sarah	Ow! 

Sarah	 Karmic retribution for killing my babies.

Sarah	Ow! 

Sarah	Oh, it's getting worse. 

Sarah	It's getting worse. 

Hank	Red is certainly different. 

Hank	But I don't know, 

Hank	maybe we could turn it into some kinda honey candy.

Alyssa	do you hear yourself? 

Alyssa	How do we know that is even safe to consume?

Alyssa	We'll have to get it tested before anyone can try it.

Alyssa	Not to mention our line is called Hank's Gold Honey.

Alyssa	We can't just rebrand every time Sarah plants a new flower.

Hank	We don't know for sure the flowers did this.

Hank	What did Lyle say? 

Alyssa	That Red is ridiculous. 

Alyssa	Said he's never seen it before. 

Sarah	I got stung. 

Alyssa	Whoa, Whoa. Congrats, you lived.

Hank	Let's get you to my operating table. 

Sarah	It's really bad. 

sarah	It's swelling. 

Hank	Hold still.

Alyssa	Sure you'll be fine. 

Sarah	I think I'm gonna faint. 

Sarah	Aw, that looks cute. 

Hank	Hey, hold still. 

Sarah	you should add more flowers though. 

Hank	Okay, let's see here. 

Sarah	Ooh, no. 

Hank	Hold still, Hold still. 

Hank	It's out. 

Sarah	Ow.

Sarah	All I can smell is honey. 

Sarah	That can't be good. 

Hank	It's probably the honey. 

Hank	Trust me. 

Hank	You did a lot more damage to my bee than I did to you.

Sarah	Can't feel my lips 

Sarah	and I'm craving cereal for some reason. 

Sarah	Is that normal? 

Hank	Don't know about that. 

Sarah	Whoa, what're you doing? 

Hank	It'll take away the itching. 

Sarah	Ouch. 

Sarah	Really hurts. 

Hank	Don't worry, the pain'll go away. 

Hank	Honey's full of medicinal properties 

Hank	depending on which type of flower the bees collect.

Sarah	Maybe I should plant marigolds. 

Sarah	They have medicinal properties. 

Alyssa	Next time you plant, can you check with us first?

Sarah	I'm sorry. 

Sarah	What's that supposed to mean? 

Alyssa	Hank, we should Be honest with her. 

Alyssa	Your flowers are turning our honey red. 

Sarah	My flowers did that? 

Hank	We don't know for sure. 

Alyssa	Yes, yes. 

Alyssa	And our seller said he won't sell it. 

Sarah	Well how's it taste? 

Hank	I'm concerned it could be something besides the flowers,

Hank	like car fluid. 

Hank	We need to get it tested to make sure it's safe to consume.

Alyssa	And again, our line is called Hank's Gold Honey, not red.

Alyssa	If this comes back as a result of your flowers,

Alyssa	you're gonna need to replant. 

Sarah	Oh, I can't replant. 

Sarah	I've put everything I have into this crop. 

Sarah	They're just starting to bloom. 

Sarah	Really, Hank? 

Sarah	Replant? 

Hank	Well. 

Sarah	Okay, Thank you for your help with this. 

Sarah	I'm sorry I caused you guys so many problems.

Sarah	I'll go. 

Hank	Sarah, wait. 

Alyssa	Why didn't you say anything? 

Alyssa	Do you not care about our honey? 

Hank	of course I do. 

Hank	But I also care about the people in this community

Hank	and Sarah is much a part of this ecosystem as the bees are.

Hank	We shouldn't be attackin' her 

Hank	for somethin' that's not her fault. 

Alyssa	Okay, Maybe not directly. 

Alyssa	But since when is Sarah a part of this community?

Alyssa	She is a city slicker if I have ever seen one.

Alyssa	And her boyfriend? 

Alyssa	Okay, don't even get me started on that dude.

Alyssa	They don't belong here, Hank. 

Alyssa	They're using us. 

Alyssa	She is using you. 

Hank	Look, can we just drop It, okay? 

Hank	I need to mail this off and get it tested. 

Chris	Hey, have you by any chance 

Chris	seen the compost bins out back? 

Mariah	you mean those bins with like rotting leaves?

Mariah	I got rid of them. 

Mariah	They smell disgusting. 

Chris	Yeah, I keep tellin' that to Sarah. 

Chris	But 

Chris	she's on one. 

Mariah	You know, I've kind of noticed 

Mariah	your relationship is a little one-sided. 

Mariah	It's much more business than romance. 

Mariah	Don't you think? 

Chris	certainly seems That way. 

Chris	This is Chris Spencer. 

Sarah	Leave a message. 

Sarah	Chris, it's me again. 

Sarah	Please call me back. 

Sarah	I don't know how many flowers to pick. 

Sarah	I mean, one of my fields has blossomed. 

Sarah	I don't know why. 

Sarah	Yeah. 

Sarah	I can't get ahold of you and Mariah isn't answering either.

Sarah	So gimme a call. 

Sarah	Bye. 

Hank	Knock, knock. 

Hank	Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. 

Sarah	It's okay. 

Hank	Truce? 

Sarah	Sure. 

Sarah	I'll go make some tea and grab a jacket. 

Hank	Tea sounds 

Hank	lovely. 

Sarah	Okay. 

Hank	Don't know why I said that. 

Hank	How's it been feeling? 

Sarah	better. 

Hank	good. 

Hank	Looks brand new. 

Hank	I'm sorry about Alyssa. 

Hank	She has always been very protective. 

Hank	So when the honey goes sour, 

Hank	she tends to swing a bat without looking. 

Sarah	Well I might not Be a problem for you guys much longer.

Sarah	Only one of my fields has blossomed 

Sarah	and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. 

Sarah	I think the universe is telling me to leave.

Hank	I don't want you to leave. 

Sarah	Okay, honey. 

Sarah	Yeah, honey. 

Sarah	We gotta choose one of these. 

Sarah	How do you pick? 

Hank	So the type of flower the bees draw from 

Hank	influences everything from the taste 

Hank	to the color to the texture. 

Hank	Like this one. 

Hank	This here, acacia. 

Sarah	Mmm, smells like candy. 

Hank	Exactly. 

Hank	Acacia's sweet. 

Hank	Classic. 

Hank	Whereas something like eucalyptus 

Hank	has a slightly more herbal flavor. 

Sarah	What about this one? 

Hank	That's sourwood. 

Hank	It's got a buttery caramel taste. 

Hank	Perfect on toast in the morning. 

Hank	But for tea, what you wanna go with is wildflower.

Sarah	hmm. 

Sarah	Speaking of flowers, 

Sarah	do you still think it was my flowers 

Sarah	that was turning your honey red? 

Hank	I've been honey swiping for a long time 

Hank	and every so often I'm surprised at what I find.

Sarah	There's been lots of surprises going on around here.

Sarah	Revelations, more like. 

Hank	How's Chris? 

Sarah	We've kind of detached since he left. 

Hank	how about I come over tomorrow 

Hank	and help you harvest the blossoms? 

Hank	Then you can take my truck to town. 

Hank	When you're gone, 

Hank	I'll have a look at your fields and see what's goin' on.

Hank	Maybe it's a water issue. 

Sarah	I'd love that. 

Sarah	But why? 

Sarah	I mean if it's my flowers that's turning your honey red,

Sarah	why would you wanna help me? 

Hank	Cause I've never been one to sit by 

Hank	and not help those I care about. 

Sarah	is It good? 

Hank	It's good. 

Hank	It's real good.

Hank	Yeah. 

Hank	Wildflower. 

Sarah	He moved My composter. 

Sarah	Chris! 

Mariah	Sarah, Hi. 

Sarah	Mariah. 

Mariah	Hi. 

Mariah	It's been so long I nearly forgot you existed.

Sarah	Well good thing my name's on the sign.

Mariah	Oh, Thank you. 

Mariah	I got engaged yesterday. 

Sarah	Congratulations.

Chris	babe, I got The Baroque text font 

Chris	for the wedding invitation. 

Chris	Hi Sarah. 

Sarah	Babe, 

Sarah	what's going on? 

Chris	So I've been meaning to talk with you. 

Chris	Things have gotten kinda carried away. 

Chris	It's been like a blur. 

Chris	I'm engaged. 

Sarah	You're engaged? 

Sarah	Well that would explain 

Sarah	why you haven't answered any of my calls. 

Sarah	How long has this been going on? 

Chris 	Since high school.

Mariah	 not long.

Sarah	Oh. 

Sarah	Great. 

Sarah	Well 

Sarah	congrats, I guess. 

Sarah	Now get out. 

Mariah	Sarah, this is our business. 

Sarah	Our? 

Sarah	No, there's no our anything. 

Sarah	There's my name on the door and you two walking through it.

Mariah	Sarah, come on. 

Mariah	I mean you can't grow crops, create floral arrangements

Mariah	and do all the log books all by yourself. 

Mariah	We made a great team. 

Mariah	You never loved Chris. 

Chris	Hey.

Mariah	Don't let personal issues cloud business, you know?

Sarah	please leave. 

Mariah	Always a flower girl, never a bride, huh?

Chris	I'm sorry. 

Chris	Just gonna grab our wedding invitations. 

Chris	They're 12 bucks a card. 

Chris	I'm sorry. 

Sarah	"Oh, hi Mariah. 

Sarah	Nice to meet you." 

Sarah	Our business?

Sarah	How long has this been happening? 

Sarah	Since high school. 

Sarah	He's just standing there. 

Sarah	Oh, this is my fiancee. 

Sarah	When were you gonna tell me? 

Sarah	Just your girlfriend, no big deal. 

Sarah	We're closed. 

Mrs. Pearls	Oh, you most certainly Are not. 

Sarah	Mrs. Pearl. 

Mrs. Pearls	I need My flower arrangements by noon today.

Mrs. Pearls	Look, Sarah. 

Mrs. Pearls	I know you've been away for a while 

Mrs. Pearls	and I heard about you and Chris. 

Sarah	you heard about that? 

Mrs. Pearls	yeah, Mariah posted it all over Instagram.

Sarah	'Course she did. 

Mrs. Pearls	now just because your love life has come to a dismal end

Mrs. Pearls	does not mean that tonight's wedding reception should.

Mrs. Pearls	So I need the 48 floral arrangements 

Mrs. Pearls	that I ordered last week. 

Sarah	I'm sorry. 

Sarah	I just got back and I didn't know about the order,

Sarah	so I don't have any floral arrangements ready.

Sarah	But I'd be happy to offer you a full refund.

Mrs. Pearls	Refund? 

Mrs. Pearls	Heavens no. 

Mrs. Pearls	You see, vases full of cash 

Mrs. Pearls	doesn't have the same ambiance as flowers. 

Mrs. Pearls	Now you do have flowers, don't you? 

Sarah	I honestly don't know what I have. 

Mrs. Pearls	Well What about those? 

Sarah	The hibiscus flowers? 

Mrs. Pearls	Yes, they're perfect for a Valentine's Day wedding.

Mrs. Pearls	So let's see. 

Mrs. Pearls	Oh, yes. 

Mrs. Pearls	The red nestled in a white bridal veil. 

Mrs. Pearls	Symbol of love, yada yada yada. 

Mrs. Pearls	So do you have more? 

Sarah	I have a whole truckload

Sarah	Foster's Flowers. 

Mrs. Pearls	[Mrs. Pearl] Hello Sarah, just calling to let you know

Mrs. Pearls	that the flowers were a huge hit. 

Mrs. Pearls	The bride absolutely loved them. 

Sarah	I'm so glad to hear that. 

Mrs. Pearls	[Mrs. Pearl] Now I would like to order 

Mrs. Pearls	20 more arrangements for the Senator's gala next week.

Mrs. Pearls	Now is that manageable? 

Sarah	I'd have to go back to my ranch 

Sarah	and see if I have more blossoms. 

Sarah	Can I call you back tomorrow to confirm? 

Mrs. Pearls	Yes. 

Mrs. Pearls	Oh and happy to hear that you're on the rebound.

Mrs. Pearls	Bye-bye for now. 

Sarah	Bye. 

Alyssa	Hey. 

Alyssa	Glad to see you made it back with our truck safe and sound.

Sarah	yeah, I was just coming by to drop off the keys

Sarah	and I was hoping I could talk to Hank. 

Alyssa	How's Chris? 

Sarah	Well he's engaged and not to me. 

Alyssa	Oh. 

Alyssa	Hank is in the barn. 

Sarah	Thanks. 

Sarah	Hank? 

Hank	Hey, you're back. 

Sarah	your back. 

Sarah	I mean your shoulders. 

Sarah	I mean your apiaries moved. 

Hank	Alyssa found a citrus farm. 

Sarah	What about My flowers? 

Hank	It's an irrigation issue. 

Hank	They need a lotta water. 

Hank	I'm not sure how you can accomplish that. 

Sarah	It's not just the water, Hank. 

Sarah	I need bees, 

Sarah	otherwise I'm gonna have to hand-pollinate 

Sarah	every single flower if I want them to go to seed.

Hank	Why Would you go to seed? 

Sarah	So I don't have to order another batch of seeds

Sarah	for next season. 

Hank	I thought you wanted to sell. 

Sarah	We're not selling. 

Hank	You're not? 

Sarah	I broke up with Chris. 

Hank	Sorry? 

Sarah	I'm not. 

Sarah	Listen, the hibiscus flowers are a huge hit

Sarah	and I wanna grow more. 

Hank	Then we'll need more water. 

Sarah	And I need bees. 

Hank	Look, Sarah. 

Hank	I can't bring those bees back. 

Hank	It's been a rough enough season as it is. 

Hank	And the red honey, I don't even know if it's safe to sell.

Sarah	You're sure my flowers did that? 

Sarah	Did the test come back? 

Hank	not yet. 

Sarah	So you assume it's me. 

Sarah	And even if it is me, you assume this tastes bad.

Sarah	You're judging something based on how it looks

Sarah	before you even know what it's made of. 

Hank	Sarah, I didn't mean it like

Sarah	no, I get it. 

Sarah	You're afraid of change 

Sarah	even if it could mean something really great.

Hank	It's the same thing over here. 

Alyssa	yeah, these Are sick too. 

Hank	They're lethargic 

Hank	and it looks like half the hive's missing. 

Alyssa	Well do you think it's a parasite or something?

Hank	I don't know. 

Hank	It's not good. 

Hank	Maybe Gilbert's farm. 

Alyssa	So you think It has somethin' to do with his crops.

Hank	I honestly don't know. 

Alyssa	Hey, I've never seen you like this before.

Hank	I'm sorry. 

Hank	It's just

Alyssa	It's Sarah, isn't it? 

Hank	come on, Alyssa. 

Hank	Not even a little bit. 

Alyssa	So a lot a bit. 

Alyssa	But you know Sarah's a botanist. 

Alyssa	You could ask her to take a look. 

Hank	I can't ask Sarah for help. 

Alyssa	Yes, you can. 

Hank	Look, I'll figure it out, okay? 

Hank	Always do. 

Hank	Just need a little time. 

Alyssa	Hey, I was supposed to teach candle making

Alyssa	at the feed store today, but I'm not feeling well.

Alyssa	Do you think you could take care of that for me?

Sarah	hmm. 

Sarah	What?

Sarah	'Kay, candle making it is. 

Hank	Sarah, Hi. 

Sarah	Alyssa invited me to Make candles. 

Hank	'Course she did. 

Sarah	Expecting a bigger turnout? 

Hank	Actually, yeah. 

Hank	Although we have five people. 

Hank	Can get pretty crazy in here, I warn ya. 

Sarah	Oh. 

Sarah	Shall we get started? 

Hank	You know, you don't have to do this. 

Hank	It's okay. 

Sarah	I think I do. 

Sarah	Your sister scares me. 

Hank	Okay. 

Hank	Well first things first, we have to melt the beeswax.

Hank	While it melts, you can choose a jar and a wick.

Sarah	this one. 

Hank	'Kay. 

Sarah	what? 

Hank	Turquoise, it's my favorite. 

Hank	Now the beeswax is pretty much melted, 

Hank	we get to add a scent. 

Hank	Take your pick. 

Sarah	Coconut. 

Hank	Coconut, all right. 

Hank	Would you like to do the honors? 

Sarah	Sure. 

Sarah	Just dump it in? 

Hank	yeah, just a little bit. 

Hank	Little bit. 

Hank	Whoa, easy now. 

Hank	Okay, now take a wick. 

Hank	Hold it up just like that, okay? 

Hank	Now keep your hands steady. 

Hank	I don't wanna burn you. 

Sarah	Don't burn me. 

Hank	Are you ready? 

Sarah	yeah. 

Hank	Okay. 

Hank	Hold it steady. 

Lyle	Hank. 

Hank	Lyle, Hey. 

Lyle	Hey. 

Lyle	Yeah. I've been meaning to talk to you about that red honey.

Lyle	I need the gold. 

Hank	I'm really sorry about that. 

Hank	I'm hopin' it clears up soon. 

Lyle	Well until then, 

Lyle	I'm gonna have to go with a different supplier.

Lyle	Hive Honey. 

Hank	You're kidding, right? 

Hank	Those guys are pretty much all corn syrup, Lyle.

Lyle	Better than empty shelves. 

Hank	I need your help. 

Sarah	Thought you'd never ask. 

Sarah	Huh, so that's where my bees have been. 

Sarah	Little traitors. 

Hank	It's nothin' personal. 

Sarah	So what's going on? 

Hank	Well they're moving at half the pace. 

Hank	Some don't even make it back to the hive. 

Hank	If I didn't know any better, I'd say they were drunk.

Hank	Something's makin' 'em sick. 

Hank	But I can't blame Gilbert for poisoning my bees

Hank	before I know for sure what it is. 

Sarah	Citrus shouldn't be hurting them. 

Hank	never has before. 

Sarah	think I found your culprit. 

Hank	what? 

Sarah	California rhododendron. 

Sarah	The leaves, flower and nectar are all toxic.

Sarah	It's an invasive plant 

Sarah	and is probably what's making your bees a little loony.

Sarah	The honey could be toxic 

Hank	But I've been selling the honey. 

Hank	We gotta get the Lloyd's and get that honey off the shelf.

Hank	It's not safe to sell. 

Sarah	Honey made from rhododendrons 

Sarah	is actually called mad honey. 

Sarah	Nobody would've died, 

Sarah	but they definitely would've experienced side effects.

Alyssa	like what? 

Sarah	Well if your bees are any indication, 

Sarah	they would've felt tired, lazy. 

Sarah	Some might've hallucinated. 

Hank	Thank you for your help. 

Hank	I need to go and round up the rest of the hives,

Hank	bring them back here. 

Alyssa	That'll turn the honey red. 

Hank	What else can I do, Lys? 

Hank	Where do I put them? 

Hank	If you have any ideas, 

Hank	please I'm listening 'cause I'm fresh out. 

Alyssa	I don't know. 

Hank	Well. 

Hank	I'll see you later, Sarah. 

Sarah	yeah. 

Alyssa	you know, My brother was engaged 

Alyssa	his senior year of college. 

Alyssa	He had a really great job working for the FDA.

Alyssa	He was on his way to the top. 

Alyssa	And on his wedding night, she left him at the altar.

Alyssa	I never wanna see my brother hurt like that again.

Sarah	I understand. 

Sarah	Do you want some help? 

Alyssa	That'd be great. 

Alyssa	Thank you. 

Alyssa	You wanna just do this for me? 

Sarah	I mean. 

Alyssa	I'm just kidding. 

Alyssa	Here you go. 

Sarah	you Actually had me. 

Sarah	Kinda scared for a second. 

Alyssa	Hey, you up for ride? 

Hank	not tonight, Lys. 

Alyssa	If this is about Sarah, you need to quit mopin' around.

Alyssa	Start acting. 

Alyssa	I know she likes you. 

Hank	She said That to you? 

Alyssa	I am a woman. 

Alyssa	I know these things. 

Hank	So she said the words, I like Hank Bright.

Alyssa	Well not exactly, But I know. 

Hank	She doesn't like me, Lys. 

Hank	She tolerates me. 

Hank	She's generally irked by me, but she doesn't like me.

Alyssa	Okay, I tolerate you. 

Alyssa	I am generally irked by you, but Sarah? 

Alyssa	Saying Sarah doesn't like you 

Alyssa	is like saying the bees don't like flowers.

Alyssa	It's just not true. 

Alyssa	You're just afraid to make a move 

Alyssa	and put your big old moody reputation on the line,

Alyssa	but it'd be really good for you. 

Sarah	Well that didn't take long. 

Sarah	Flower by ceremony with hibiscus bloom and honey. 

Sarah	Huh. 

Sarah	Sounds great. 

(Song)	If ever you 

(Song)	Walk away 

(Song)	Well you won't need to look behind 

(Song)	Cause I'll be runnin' 

(Song)	After you 

(Song)	My love 

Hank	Okay. 

Hank	C'mon, Hank. 

Hank	You got this. 

Hank	It's not scary. 

Hank	Bees are more scary. 

Hank	That's not true, okay.

(Song)	My love 

Hank	Sarah? 

(Song)	Rain 

(Song)	It's gonna fall 

(Song)	I'll 

(Song)	Hear you when you call 

Hank	Sarah, I know it's late 

Hank	and you probably don't wanna see me right now,

Hank	but there's somethin' I wanted to tell you.

Hank	Somethin' that I've wanted to tell you 

Hank	since I first saw you fall off that chair. 

(Song)	I'm gonna let you live your life 

Hank	I love you! 

Hank	Sarah?

(Song)	We sit at the table 

(Song)	And still refuse to eat 

(Song)	Keep our hands filled with pitchforks to use as cutlery

(Song)	I don't wanna fight with you 

Alyssa	you have mail. 

Hank	It's open. 

Sarah	Dear Hank, I've been doing a lotta thinking,

Sarah	a lot of meditation, a lot of reflection. 

Sarah	And one thing has become certain in my heart:

Sarah	I wanna protect you and the bees above all else.

Sarah	So I've decided to turn my land over to you.

Sarah	My flowers are not gonna grow. 

Sarah	The county denied me more water. 

Sarah	I have a shop coming to collect all the flowers

Sarah	that do bloom in a couple weeks. 

Sarah	After that, you'll be free to plant 

Sarah	whatever flower or crop you see fit. 

Sarah	I know it's wrong of me not to say goodbye in person,

Sarah	but I physically couldn't. 

Sarah	Saying goodbye to you, 

Sarah	a real official goodbye will break my heart.

Sarah	So I hope you can forgive me and I hope you know

Sarah	that I will forever carry this summer in my heart.

Sarah	PS, 

Sarah	the red honey is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.

Sarah	Maybe give it a try. 

Sarah	Alyssa? 

Alyssa	Mmm. 

Hank	Alyssa, you're never gonna believe it. 

Alyssa	The red honey, it's

Alyssa	It's delicious. 

Hank	how did you know? 

Alyssa	I read Sarah's letter first 

Alyssa	and then the FDA called and said the honey's safe.

Alyssa	So I thought what the heck? 

Hank	We'll go over my complete breach of privacy later.

Alyssa	So? 

Hank	I think I need to go. 

Alyssa	What, where? 

Hank	to stop Sarah from leaving. 

(Song)	You can just keep on walkin'

Hank	not from The county Well. 

Hank	But from the stream that's technically yours,

Hank	there's plenty of water. 

Sarah	It's incredible. 

Hank	your Aunt Lilith always used to say 

Hank	that men sit on the left in church 

Hank	because women are always right. 

Hank	And you were right. 

Sarah	about what? 

Hank	you were right for me. 

Hank	You're hardworking, brilliant 

Hank	and so beautiful. 

Hank	Reading your letter knowing you're leaving 

Hank	and then to giving me your fields so my bees could prosper,

Hank	I knew then that you were the woman 

Hank	I wanted to hold and cherish. 

Hank	I'm givin' you back your fields 

Hank	'cause they were never mine to take 

Hank	and I'll plant whatever you want me to. 

Hank	So you would get back in that car 

Hank	and never set eyes on this place again 

Hank	or you could stay, 

Hank	stay and have a best friend 

Hank	that'll love you unconditionally forever. 

(Song)	I will always love you 

Sarah	I can't believe you did all this. 

Sarah	Yes. 

(Song)	I love you more than the rain loves the wind 

(Song)	I love you more than the trees love the sun
