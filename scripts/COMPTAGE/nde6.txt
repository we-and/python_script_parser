Dippy			Elias will know for sure."

Elias			The light chain goes over there.

Crane 			This will be perfect for the Northern Lights Festival!

Dippy			It'll be great fun!"

Elias			We probably should have sent outmore invitations on Boatbook."

Elias			Do you think more people will come this year?

Trawler		Get serious! Why would anyone come to a Northern Lights Festival when there are no northern lights to see?  Just a big storm brewing on the horizon. That is the silliest…

Crane			"Then we'll just havea festival for us!"

Elias			"Look! Here comes the Queen of the Sea!"

Elias		She´ll know for sure if any more people will be coming. Maybe even boats from Big Harbor!

Trawler		Big Harbor. Bah! What do they have that we don't have right here?

Crane			A festive atmosphere?

Gill			Where are we going, Gull?

Gull			To find food!"

Gull			Big boat means big food!

Big Blinky		Good evening, ma'am. In a rush?"

Queen of the Sea	"I have to get to Big Harbor before the big storm hits."

Elias			"Big storm? But what about the festival?"

Queen of the Sea	"You can forget about that festival. No boats should be out now."

Gerald			Gerald in Big Harbor calling all rescue boats!"

Elias			Elias here

Gerald"		Hi, Elias!

Gerald			We've received report of a vessel -

Gerald	-		adrift out at the Black Hole.

Elias			The Black Hole?

Elias			In this weather?

Queen of the Sea	That boat is driftwood already.

Gerald			I'm having engine trouble and can't go out.

Gerald			Any chance of you getting out there?

Elias			Sure. I'll go as fast as I can.

Gerald			Thank you, Elias. Be careful. And listen:

Gerald			I owe you one.

Big Blinky		The Black Hole? Do you know how many ships have vanished there?

Queen of the Sea	Indeed. Oh my.

Big Blinky		...And never come out again?"

Queen of the Sea	"It's much too dangerous for a little boat."

Elias			Good thing I'm not little anymore!

Queen of the Sea	Well, well.

Queen of the Sea	"My timetable. I must continue."

Queen of the Sea	Ship ahoy!

Gill			No food?

Elias			That was close!

Elias			Hello!

Elias			"I'm Elias. The rescue boat."

Vinnie			So I see.

Vinnie			Who are you here to rescue?

Elias			You!

Vinnie			I don't need rescuing.

Vinnie			I just need to get my engine started again.

Elias			Let me try to ...

Vinnie			Be careful! Don't push me against the rocks!"

Vinnie			Pull!

Elias			I'm doing my best."

Vinnie			Pull!

Vinnie			Call for more help, you imbecile!

Elias			My radio doesn't work!

Vinnie		Of course not. There's too much electromagnetic interference around here. Don't you know anything?

Vinnie			Why did they send a baby rescue boat?

Elias			Baby? I'm no baby!"

Vinnie			This isn't the way to Big Harbor.

Elias			No, we're going to Cozy Cove.

Vinnie			Cozy Cove? That dump?"

Elias		I know my way to Cozy Cove. It's my home. I'm not taking any chances navigating in strange waters in this storm."

Dippy		How crazy can he be going out to the Black Hole in that storm? He must be totally nuts!

Elias			Shh!

Dippy			He doesn't scare me.

Vinnie			Where am I?

Elias			Cozy Cove. We'll find a berth for you.

Vinnie			A berth? Never mind that!

Vinnie			Do you have a shipyard? I need to fix my engine."

Elias			Sure, but now? In the middle of the night?

Vinnie		Those guys will think it's a real treat to get to fix a boat from Big Harbor, out here in the middle of nowhere."

Vinnie			Yech! I hate fish!

Elias			We can try to wake Goliath.

Dippy 			I thought you were gone for good.

Elias			I always come back, Dippy."

Dippy			No northern lights tonight either.

Elias			What about that over there?

Dippy			No, that's just the city lights from Big Harbor."

Dippy			Good night, Elias.

Elias			Good night, Dippy."

Gull			What's your name?

Crab			Give me a hand.

Gull			I don't have hands.

Gill			I have mayonnaise.

Gull			Get him!	

Crab			See these claws?"

Elias			Good morning, Swifty! Sleep well?"

Elias			I've heard of early birds, but you're an early boat!"

Crane			Some storm last night, eh?

Elias			Sure was.

Elias			How are things with Vinnie?

Crane			He left before dawn."

Elias			Really? He didn't even say thanks."

Crane			Yeah, he sure was an oddball.

Goliath		I hope you don't make it a habit to rescue boats from the Black Hole in the middle of the night."

Elias			Do I have many dents?

Goliath"		No, just some small stuff."

Goliath		I'm thinking about that guy you towed in here last night. What was his name? Winnie?"

Elias			Vinnie.

Goliath		Strange character."

Goliath		"He wanted me to fix his engine, but was real careful not to let me look in his cargo hold."

Goliath		"Maybe he was just shy. Not that he had any reason to be."

Goliath		"There's no part of a boat I haven't seen before."

Cruiser		There's our hero!

Elias			I just did my job."

Trawler		Is it your job to be an idiot?

Trawler		You could have been smashed to bits out there.

Goliath		There, there.

Trawler		You should be more careful

Henry			Toot-toot! Make way for the messenger boat!

Henry		I have a message for the rescue boat Elias from Her Deep Floating Highness, the Queen of the Sea:"

Henry		In light of your heroic deeds performed with valor during the night, the Queen of the Sea, on behalf of Big Harbor and all vessels who have been or ever will be in danger, invites you to the aforementioned harbor, Big Harbor, that is, To receive a surprise this evening."""
Henry			End message.

Henry			Understood?

Elias			Eh, I didn't quite …

Henry		In light of your heroic deeds performed with valor last night, the Queen of the Sea ..."""

Elias			Yes, I understood the part where the Queen of the Sea wants me to 			come to Big Harbor, but why? What's going to happen?"

Henry		That information is classified. That is the whole idea behind a surprise. Understood?"

Elias			OK ...

Elias			"If the Queen of the Sea sends an invitation, we have to accept."

Trawler		Huh? Are we there yet?

Dippy			Look at all those lights!

Cruiser		That's what I call snazzy.

Trawler		I've seen worse, if you ask me.

Bobby			Welcome to Big Harbor!

Elias			It's very nice to be here

Bobby			We thank you."

Bobby			See you later.

Gill			The big city, Gull!

Gull			Do you think they have any food here?"

Gill			Do they ever! Look!"

Gull			First come, first serve!

Elias			"It's important that we stay together and ..."

Marcus		Hi! Are you that dude they call Elias?"

Elias			Eh, yeah.

Marcus		"We dig you. Both of us. Really!"

Martinus		By the way, Elias, now that you're a star ...

Marcus		Just remember to stay grounded.

Martinus		Or ""watered,"" I guess. Get it?"

Marcus		Bye, Elias!

Martinus		Good luck!"

Girl Boat		Eh ... You're Elias, right?"

Elias			"Yes. Why do you ask?"

Girl Boat		Hello!

Girl Boat		You're like all over the news.

Girl Boat		"What was it like, Out there in that storm all alone?

Elias			Well … I was just doing my job.

Girl Boat 		Can we take a selfie?

Elias			Uh, sure."

Girl Boat 1		Look this way, Elias!

Girl Boat 2		Over here!"

Girl Boat		This is gonna get 300 likes on Instaship … easy!

Queen of the Sea	There, there, small boats. Leave our hero alone.

Girl Boat		We love you, Elias!"

Queen of the Sea	"Nice of you to come. We have arranged a small reception for you."

Queen of the Sea	Risking his own safety, -

Queen of the Sea	"- he ventured out into the storm and rescued Vinnie."

Queen of the Sea	"As proof of your bravery and to show our appreciation of this achievement, I have, on behalf of Big Harbor ...

Trawler"		Will you look at that!"

Queen of the Sea	the pleasure of presenting you with this special fender!"

Henry			"The fender is hereby presented according to HSE regulations."

Henry			Is the fender received?

Henry			Assignment completed. Applause. Resounding."

Gerald			Hi, Elias. Great that you could take that assignment for me."

Elias			My pleasure. You're Gerald, right?"

Gerald			Big Harbor's very own rescue boat, at your service."

Gerald			I've been in for repairs a little too often lately."

Gerald			It's hard work being a rescue boat in a big city like Big Harbor."

Elias			I can imagine.

Gerald			Well, well. Come and say hello if you're ever in town again."

Elias			I'll do that.

Stella			Wazzup?

Elias			Huh?

Stella			I asked you what's up? Nice fender."

Elias			Thanks. I just got it for rescuing a boat."

Stella			Respect!

Elias			Do you … want to take a picture?

Stella			A picture? Of what?"

Elias			Me and you.

Stella			Are you full of yourself, or what?

Elias			Sorry. I just thought that was normal around here."

Stella			You're cute.

Elias			Cute?

Stella			Fine, let's take a picture."
Stella			My name is Stella.

Elias			I'm Elias.

Stella			See you later, Rescue Boy! If you're ever in town again!

Elias			Don't rule it out!

Queen of the Sea	Elias?

Elias			Yes, ma'am

Queen of the Sea	There's something I want to talk to you about. Ready for a chat?

Elias			OK.

Queen of the Sea	Ready for a chat?

Elias			OK.

Queen of the Sea	Do you like Big Harbor?

Elias			Oh, yes. Very much!"

Queen of the Sea	Well I think Big Harbor likes you too.

Elias			You think so?

Queen of the Sea	And Big Harbor needs a hero."

Queen of the Sea	We have one rescue boat.

Elias			Gerald.

Queen of the Sea	Yes. He's real nice.

Queen of the Sea	"But we need a faster boat. One that understands our youth."

Queen of the Sea	"One that  everyone can look up to. One not in need of constant repairs."

Elias			That can't be easy to find.

Queen of the Sea	No, it sure isn't.

Queen of the Sea	But we have found one now.

Elias			But we have found one now. oh?"

Queen of the Sea	You!

Elias			Me? Eh …

Queen of the Sea	"Yes, Elias. We had a surprise for you."

Queen of the Sea	But I also have an offer for you.

Elias			OK?

Queen of the Sea	Elias, do you want to become -

Queen of the Sea	the new rescue boat -

Queen of the Sea	in Big Harbor?

Elias			Wow ... But what about Cozy Cove?"

Queen of the Sea	"I need to load some cargo. I'm heading north tomorrow."

Queen of the Sea	I expect an answer from you before then.

Queen of the Sea	Ship ahoy!

Cruiser		Wow, that's quite an offer!

Cruiser 		You have to jump on it, Elias.

Elias			Would you?"

Cruiser		Everyone was talking about you at the party. You're a hero, Elias!"
		
Cruiser		You could be the biggest fish of all.

Gull			Huh? Did someone say fish?

Elias			Do your really think so?

Cruiser		You have to make the most of the chances you get."

Cruiser		Just ask Trawler.

Cruiser		Ask him about Brazil.

Elias			Trawler?

Elias			Trawler!

Elias			Sorry, but Cruiser ...
Trawler		Spit ot out, boy! Or has a crab got your tongue?"

Elias			Eh … Brazil.

Trawler		What about Brazil? I don't know anything about Brazil."

Elias			Cruiser just said that I should ask you about ..."

Trawler		Feel that rhythm!

Elias			Hello?"

Trawler		Ra-ba-da, cha-cha-cha!

Trawler		Amazing ...

Elias			Trawler?"

Trawler		I was asked once to go fishing in Brazil."

Trawler		But I never went. I stayed in Cozy Cove and fished for herring."

Trawler		And that's that!

Trawler		But now I have to sleep and rest up for tomorrow.

Elias			OK.

Elias			Stella!

Stella			Hello, Sailor Boy!

Elias			Uh, I just wanted to say, it was nice meeting you, and ...

Gull			Breakfast time?

Elias			What was the point of that?

Dippy			Elias, we've been here long enough. Can we go home now?"

Elias			No, I have to fix something first.

Dippy			Fine. We'll go on ahead. You'll come after, right?"

Elias			Yes, I'll be along soon.I promise."

Queen of the Sea	"Excellent choice, Elias. Big Harbor."

Queen of the Sea	"If you can make it here, you can, well, you can make it both here and there."

Queen of the Sea	"I have to leave soon to head north, so we haven't much time."

Queen of the Sea	"Don't give me that, Gerald! We agreed this is for the best."

Gerald			You agreed.

Elias			Where are you going?"

Gerald			Away from Big Harbor.

Gerald			No one needs me around here anymore.

Elias			But I thought we were going to work together?

Gerald			Oh no. Nope. You're on your own now, Elias.

Gerald			Don't forget to take care of your engine.

Gerald			It can get burned out.

Queen of the Sea	"Come now, Elias. You have much to learn."

Annoyed Boat	Hey! Watch where you're going!

Queen of the Sea	You may think you know what to do.

Queen of the Sea	But you'll soon discover there's more to handle in this city.

Elias			Hello!"

Queen of the Sea	Rescue work is important, but preventative work is just as important."

Queen of the Sea	Do you know what preventative means, Elias?

Elias			Eh, no."

Queen of the Sea	"In addition to getting boats out of trouble, -"

Queen of the Sea	"- you also have to make sure They don't get into trouble."

Elias			I see.

Voice			Hey, look out!"

Truck 1		You trying to kill me, or something?

Truck 2		Kill you?"

Truck 1		I told you not to pull that chain until I was in position.

Truck 3		Are you complaining about me again? Hey! Are you talking to me?

Truck 4		Jerk!"

Queen of the Sea	"Now, now, boys. Calm down!"

Queen of the Sea	"Deal with problems before they become problems. Understand?"

Elias			OK.

Queen of the Sea	"Keep your eyes open. Investigate."

Spanish Cargo Ship 1	Qu? alegría encontrarte aquí tan al Norte!

Spanish Cargo Ship 2	Si, qué buena sorpresa!!

Spanish Cargo Ship 1	Y qué te parecen los puertos por aquí en Noruega?


Spanish Cargo Ship 2	Los puertos están muy bien, pero al bacalao de Noruega es todavía mejor.


Spanish Cargo Ship 1	Si, el bacalao es realmente superior 

Elias				Huh?

Queen of the Sea	Spanish. You have to know a little bit of everything here in town."

Bobby			You're supposed to navigate around the buoys.

Queen of the Sea	Elias, this is our beacon, Bobby."

Queen of the Sea	Bobby, this is our new rescue boat.

Elias			We've already met."

Bobby			Rescue boat?

Bobby			Good one!

Bobby			Rescue ...

Bobby			Yeah ... Eh, nope ..."

Bobby			That wasn't a joke.

Queen of the Sea	No."

Queen of the Sea	Come, we need to prepare you for life in the city.

Elias			Yes!"

Bobby			This is going to end like ...

Gull			I finally got it out!

Queen of the Sea	I see you are in good hands.

Elias			Ta-da!

Queen of the Sea	Yes, well I have to take on some cargo, and then …

Elias			Are you leaving already?"

Queen of the Sea	Vinnie's cargo must be delivered.

Elias			 Vinnie? What sort of cargo does he carry?

Queen of the Sea	That was a very direct question."

Queen of the Sea	"In my business one doesn't ask. One transports!"

Elias			Eh, OK.

Queen of the Sea	Look. You need to hurry to the marina. There has been an incident."

Elias			I'm on it.

Queen of the Sea	Good. We're counting on you."

Queen of the Sea	Ship ahoy!

Kinder Teacher 	Boat	Stay together now Boat No ...

Elias			Careful! Careful now! Remember the right of way."

Elias			Hey, slow down!

Elias			Seriously! The speed limit is 5 knots inside the harbor."

Cabin Cruiser		Sorry about that. Was I going a little too fast, maybe?"

Elias			Yes. Just don't let it happen again, OK?"

Elias			Hey, look out!

Cargo Ship		I didn't see a thing.

Elias			That was a close call!

Teenage Boat		Hey, thanks. I was just listening to some loud music."

Truck 1		Are you crazy, or what?

Truck 2		You keep your mouth shut, knucklehead!"

Truck 3		Give me a break! You can't stand there."

Elias			Hey, guys! Stop arguing!

Elias			If you cooperate, you'll be able to get twice as much done."

Truck 1		He may have a point.

Truck 3		We could calm down, I guess."

Truck 1, 2, 3		Sounds like a good idea.
Elias			Good. See you tomorrow, then. Bye!"

Queen of the Sea	Calling Elias. Calling Elias."

Elias			Yes, Elias here.

Queen of the Sea	Is everything OK?

Elias			Uh, sure. No problem."

Queen of the Sea	Excellent. Excellent. You need to go to the stockfish warehouse and help a boat that is stuck there.

Elias			I'm on my way.

Elias			Stockfish warehouse, stockfish warehouse ..."

Elias			There it is!

Elias			Is this where you needed help from a rescue boat?

Terry		"Brilliant deduction! You understood that much already. Now hurry up, little fella, and go get Gerald."

Elias			Gerald doesn't work in Big Harbor anymore.

Terry			Who is his replacement?	

Elias			I am."

Terry			You? Are you some sort of intern?"

Elias			No, I'm the new rescue boat.

Terry			Then don't just bob around! Rescue me!"

Elias			OK.

Terry			Is it too late to get Gerald back?

Crane			Catch!

Elias			Now pull!

Elias			Put it in reverse.

Terry			I know that!"

Elias			And a heave ...
Terry			And a ho!"

Elias			Yech!

Gull			Did you order take-away?

Gill			Huh? No. But it sure does smell good."

Gull			It smells lovely, if you ask me.

Bobby			If I had fingers, -

Bobby			I would hold my nose.
	
Stella			Hi there!

Elias			Uh, hi.

Stella			I thought you had left.

Elias			No, I'm staying here.

Elias			I'm the new rescue boat here in town.

Stella			Respect!"

Gull			Food!

Stella			Rough day?

Elias			Naaah		

Stella			Then come take a little cruise with me."

Elias			The Queen of the Sea said I had to make sure to get enough sleep.

Stella			Booooring!

Elias			Yeah, but I am the new rescue boat here in town.

Stella			Know what else you are?

Elias			Uh, no.

Stella			The smelliest boat in Big Harbor."

Stella			Come on, stockfish. I know how we can get rid of that smell."

Stella			Watch this.

Stella			Look how lazy they are!

Stella			I've seen garden hoses with more pressure."

Stella			You couldn't even moisten a stamp.

Stella			Less energy than a boy band.

Elias			Is this very smart?

Elias			They're getting pretty angry ...

Elias			I'll get you for this, Stella!

Elias			Thanks for the shower.

Stella		And now that you're clean, you have to come out on the town with me."

Elias			But my job ...

Stella	Have I told you the story about two other boats we had in our gang?"

Elias			Eh, no.

Stella		Billy Bob and Little Jane. Two cool boats who came to town looking for some fun"

Stella		The nicest two boats you could imagine. They were part of our gang. Then one day … they vanished."

Elias			But boats don't just vanish, do they?

Stella		My point is, no one knows what tomorrow may bring. That's why I want to live today.

Stella			Tomorrow I may ... vanish.

Elias			Hi.

Racer			If it isn't ...

Speedster		 our little rescue boat!"

Brenda		I already feel safer.

Stella			Relax, guys. He's cool. Where's the party?"
Racer			The party is wherever we want it to be!

Brenda		Party!

Gill			This town never sleeps!

Elias			Wow! I don't even think Swifty can do a trick like that!"

Elias			That almost looks like the northern lights.

Elias			Hello?

Grabber		What are you doing here, kid?

Trigger		Well, if it isn't the town's new rescue boat."

Grabber		Rescue boat or rescued boat? Huh? Which is it?"

Trigger		I say, let's find out.

Vinnie			Hey, what's going on here?

Grabber		Look at him! He can't swim!"

Vinnie			So help him.

Vinnie			Help him!

Vinnie			Grabber!

Vinnie			Now! Before it's too late.

Grabber		OK."

Trigger		"That's a great trick, if you want to drown."

Grabber		If you want to save yourself, little rescue boat, stay away from this part of the harbor!"

Stella			Are you all right?

Elias			I ran into Vinnie and the others. They are up to something."

Stella			I told you to stay away from Vinnie. Promise me you will!"

Elias			Fine.I promise."

Stella			Come on, handsome.

Gull			I'm trying to sleep.

Gill			No chance!

Henry			Turn off that music!

Brenda		Says who?

Henry		Says me! And if that music continues you will all be expelled from the harbor!"

Henry		By the authority of the Queen of the Sea and Big Harbor, have I made myself clear?"

Henry			No more music! The party is over!"

Henry			Elias?

Elias			Uh, yes.

Henry			What are you doing here?"

Elias			Me?

Elias			Uh, I was just ... passing by.

Gill			I like the city. There's so much action here."

Queen of the Sea	Stella? What are you saying? We cannot tolerate a rescue boat who hangs out with riffraff.

Gill			There's so much drama!

Elias			No, ma'am."

Queen of the Sea	"Have you lost all sense of direction? What has happened to you? I'll give you one more chance."

Queen of the Sea	"Just one more chance to show me that I wasn't wrong in choosing you. Now do your job!"

Elias			Yes, ma'am

Queen of the Sea	And clean yourself up! You have algae on your bow!

Elias			Oh … OK."

Queen of the Sea	I don't have time for this. I must be off.

Queen of the Sea	"So no more of this LOL or ROFL or whatever it is you young boats are up to."

Queen of the Sea	Ship ahoy!

Elias	Hang on!

Elias	Hello!

Elias	"You said my job also was to investigate."

Queen of the Sea	"What do you have in mind? I'm in a hurry. I have work to do."

Elias	"I think that Vinnie and his friends are up to something."

Queen of the Sea	"Really? What might that be?"

Elias			I don't know, but ...

Queen of the Sea	Well, why don't we ask them?"

Vinnie			Careful with that crate!

Trigger		Now what?

Queen of the Sea	"Elias seems to think that you boys are up to something."

Trigger		Hm?

Grabber		Huh?

Trigger		What do you mean?

Grabber		With us?"

Queen of the Sea	These are gentlemen. You wouldn't think for a moment that I would do business with thugs do you?

Elias			No, ma'am, but Stella said ...

Queen of the Sea	"Stella? Stella?! That gang of troublemakers?"

Queen of the Sea	Good thing Vinnie broke away from that gang, isn't that right?

Vinnie			Mhm."

Queen of the Sea	"You have one more chance. Now go and get a good night's sleep, so you'll be refreshed and ready for work tomorrow."

Queen of the Sea	OK.

Elias			Ship ahoy!"

Grabber		Hoist it up. A little higher."

Grabber		Higher! That's good."

Stella			Elias?

Elias			Hi!

Elias			Uh, where's the gang?

Stella			We thought we'd lay low for a while after we got busted."

Elias			Excellent! I mean ... good thinking."

Stella			But we could still do something. You know, just the two of us."

Elias			I don't know. I really should sleep and ..."

Stella			Hey, don't you like me?

Elias			Yes, I like you a lot, but the Queen of the Sea said that …

Stella			A lot?

Stella			You like me a lot?

Elias			Well, I mean ... You're OK."

Stella			Come on!

Bobby			Hi there!

Stella			Come on, Elias!

Gull			I'm the king of the world!

Henry			Elias! We've been looking all over for you."

Henry			Didn't you get our calls? Over!"

Elias			Uh, I've been kind of busy, and ...

Henry			A fishing boat has run aground out on Block Reef."

Henry			You must go, immediately! Understood?
Elias			Uh, yes, of course."

Stella			Go ahead, Elias. I'll see you later."

Henry			Now!

Fishing Boat		No!

Fishing Boat		No, help!

Elias			How can I help?

Queen of the Sea	For starters, you should have been here hours ago." Fishing Boat

Queen of the Sea	"-Nooo, help me! That's what you could have and should have done."

Elias 			But, uh, I can tow him back to shore.

Queen of the Sea	No, you can't."

Queen of the Sea	Because you are fired!

Elias			"What? Fired?"

Queen of the Sea	I was forced to alter my schedule in order to take care of things here.

Queen of the Sea	And I never alter my schedule.

Queen of the Sea	Never!

Elias			But ...


Queen of the Sea	"By the time I have returned to Big Harbor I want you packed and gone.

Fishing Boat		Help! Hello?

Queen of the Sea	And you can forget about coming back."

Elias			But ...

Fishing Boat		Helloooooo!"

Queen of the Sea	"You have made yourself, and me, a laughingstock!"

Queen of the Sea	Ship a-hoy!
Stella			Elias!

Bobby		You have to remember that things go up and down here in life, Elias."

Bobby			Up.

Bobby			And down.

Bobby			And up.

Bobby			And down.
	
Stella			Elias, where are you?

Elias			I have to go somewhere.

Stella			When will you be back?"

Elias			I don't know.

Stella			Eli...

Big Blinky		Elias!

Big Blinky		I hear you got a job in town.

Big Blinky		How are you doing?

Crane			Elias! Are you here to visit?"

Elias			Yeah, I guess you could call it a visit.

Dippy			Maybe he's finally come to say goodbye."

Elias			What do you mean?

Dippy			You said you'd come after us, but you never did."

Elias			Well, I'm home again now.

Elias			So, have you missed having a rescue boat around here?

Crane			Eh, sure. Eh ..."

Gerald			Hi, Elias.

Dippy			Have you met Gerald?"

Elias			Yes, he was the rescue boat in Big Harbor until ..."

Elias 			He got fired.

Gerald			Aren't you in Big Harbor?"

Elias			Uh, yes. But I'd rather work here instead."

Gerald			That will be hard. I'm the rescue boat around here now."

Elias			Oh? OK ..."

Elias			That's ... great.

Crane			Uh … hum."

Elias			No, Swifty. You can't come with me."

Elias			You belong here.

Big Blinky		The thing is, Elias, you must never forget your friends."

Big Blinky		And sometimes it's OK to apologize.

Elias			Yeah? Well I look forward to when they do!

Helinor		Hi, Elias!

Elias			Fancy seeing you here.-Can I stay here for a few days?"

Helinor		Sure. But didn't you move to Big Harbor?"

Elias			Yes. But now I've moved back home."

Elias			Or not exactly home. I'm clearly not welcome here either."

Helinor		Why aren't you welcome in Cozy Cove?

Elias			It seems Swifty and Dippy have found a new friend."

Helinor		Do you need anything?

Elias			No. I'm fine, I guess."

Elias			Hey! Why did you do that?

Helinor		To check if you were alive.

Helinor		You've been lying here for days. You have to do something."
Elias		I don't have to do anything. That's the good thing about getting fired."

Helinor		But you've been here so long, you have algae growing on your fender."

Elias			Fine. I'll do something."

Helinor		What are you going to do?

Elias			I wish I never rescued Vinnie out here."

Elias			Him, here?

Elias			Now, Vinnie, let's see what you're up to."

Elias			Maybe this isn't so smart.

Elias			I wouldn't want to be here when the tide comes in."

Vinnie			Come on. Fill it all the way up!"

Vinnie			That's enough, Billy Bob and Little Jane."

Vinnie			My hold is full enough, and the tide's coming in."

Vinnie			OK, I'm leaving now.

Billy Bob		 What about this?

Vinnie			Fine, get that last crate on board."

Vinnie			Hey!

Elias			Shoot!

Big Blinky		The Black Hole? Are you sure? No one goes in there willingly."

Trolley		Oh?

Big Blinky		They say it's only possible to go in during low tide."

Elias			What happens if you're in there at high tide?

Big Blinky		Then you'd get skewered on the rocks that hang from the roof like dragon's teeth."

Big Blinky		Stalactites, they're called

Elias			But why would anyone want to go in there?"

Big Blinky		Well, rumor has it there's a precious metal in there. Norwegium."

Big Blinky		It's valuable, rare, and stronger than steel."

Trolley		Could I get some for my wheels?

Big Blinky		No."

Big Blinky		It's against the law to mine norwegium."

Big Blinky		"The metal is so powerful that if you remove it from the bedrock, it causes electromagnetic radiation."

Elias			That must be why my radio stopped working.

Big Blinky		Not only that."

Big Blinky		Some say norwegium can influence the weather and disrupt the atmospheric balance."

Big Blinky		So the northern lights disappear.

Elias			Do you think Vinnie is mining norwegium?

Big Blinky		Oh no, no, no, I don't think so."

Big Blinky		He's much too big to work in there.

Elias			Hm, strange. I have to get to the bottom of this.

Trolley		To the bottom? That doesn't sound good."

Big Blinky		Are you going to do it alone?

Elias			I have to. There is no one else who can help me."

Big Blinky		Be careful, Elias!

Trolley		Why doesn't he just apologize to his friends?"

Big Blinky		If only it were that simple.

Trolley		But it is!

Big Blinky		Perhaps, Trolley."

Big Blinky		Perhaps.
Grabber		The coast is clear!

Vinnie			OK, we'll send a new shipment tomorrow."

Vinnie			Come on. Fill it all the way up."

Vinnie			Are you ready soon?

Trigger		We're almost finished."

Trigger		Just a few more crates.

Grabber		OK, that's it.

Vinnie		The Queen of the Sea is so full of herself, she won't suspect anything."

Grabber		Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Trigger		That old wreck? She's clueless!"

Grabber		What was that?

Grabber		See anything?

Trigger		Hello?

Trigger		Hello?

Trigger		Hello!

Trigger		Sleep on, old man!

Freighter		I never said that ...

Elias			Stella?

Elias			Oh, it's just you.

Stella			Just me? Some friend you are!"

Stella			I didn't think you were the kind to just run off."

Elias			Uh, I lost my job.

Stella			So? That's no reason to leave me."

Elias			No, sorry.

Elias		I thought you were glad to see me go, because I had been such a jerk."

Stella		You could at least have said goodbye. I missed you. I don't like it when friends disappear, Elias."

Stella			Didn't I tell you about Little Jane and Billy Bob?"

Elias			You sure did. And I know where they are!"

Stella			In there?

Stella			Are we going in there?

Elias			I've gone in there before. It's OK at ebb tide, when the water is ..."

Stella			I know what ebb tide is.

Elias			Of course. Sorry."

Elias			Did you really miss me?

Stella			Miss and miss ...

Elias			OK, let's go in.

Elias			Are you afraid?

Elias			Good. Because there's nothing to be afraid of."

Elias			It was just a bat.

Stella			I knew that.

Elias			This is where they were.

Stella			Little Jane?"

Stella			Billy Bob? Are you here?"

Stella			Hello?

Stella			There's no one here.

Stella			Hello?

Little Jane		Hey, Billy Bob, ready to take five?"

Stella			Little Jane? Billy Bob?"
Little Jane		Stella! What are you doing here?"

Stella			What are you doing here?

Little Jane		We're working for Vinnie, of course.

Elias			But you're drilling for norwegium. That's illegal."

Billy Bob		Really?

Little Jane		There must be some misunderstanding."

Stella			But you're in chains.

Billy Bob		These chains are for our own safety."

Little Jane		Vinnie puts our pay in the bank, and ...

Billy Bob		And we even get vacation allowance."

Little Jane		We've been duped!

Billy Bob		There's probably no retirement fund either, is there?"

Elias			You should go ask Vinnie about that.

Little Jane		We can't."

Little Jane		We're chained here.

Elias			I'll get help. I promise!

Stella			We'll be right back."

Stella			What do we do now?

Elias			Now she has to believe us!"

Queen of the Sea	What? Where?"

Queen of the Sea	Oh, I should have known it was you. Have you come back to cause trouble again? I need my afternoon nap. I have to stay on schedule!"

Elias		I'm sorry to wake you up, ma'am, but we need your help. Two boats have been taken prisoner, and …"

Queen of the Sea	"Didn't I say you were no longer welcome here?"

Elias			Please listen! Vinnie and his gang are smuggling norwegium!"
Elias			And you're helping them.

Queen of the Sea	What are you saying? Have you no shame at all?"

Queen of the Sea	Do you think this nonsense will help you get your job back? Yes, I mean no, but …"

Queen of the Sea	Get lost! And take that little rabble-rouser with you."

Queen of the Sea	And if I hear you repeat these absurd accusations again, either here or in Cozy Cove or wherever you might be, -

Queen of the Sea	I'll see to it that you are reduced to splinters!"

Queen of the Sea	Ship ahoy!

Stella			Now what do we do?

Elias			We have one last option."

Dippy			So now we're good enough?

Elias		Can't we forget about that argument and just save those two boats. You can apologize later."

Dippy			You want us to apologize?

Stella			Dippy, can you help us, or not?"

Stella			We have to know now.

Dippy			Can't anyone else help?"

Elias			You, Swifty and Helinor are the only ones I can trust.

Elias		The others might tattle to the Queen of the Sea, and I'll be reduced to splinters!

Dippy			Might be just as well.

Elias			Huh?

Dippy			Whatever. Fine. We're in. But we could use more help."

Stella		Well, you know, Elias isn't the only one with friends he can count on."

Stella			Brenda, initiate Plan B!

Racer			Hey! You old, rusty wreck!"

Vinnie			Out of my way!

Racer			Hey, dude! Out for a cruise?"

Vinnie			Get out of my way!

Vinnie			I need to pass! Hello!"

Vinnie			Can you turn off that ridiculous music?"

Brenda		We can't hear you. Our music's too loud."

Elias			Let's go in!

Billy Bob		You came back!

Elias			And we brought Dippy. She can break your chains." Dippy Later!

Elias			Soon you'll be free!

Speedster		Hey, lay off my brother!

Vinnie			I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to treat you two differently."

Speedster		Hey! That wasn't cool! 

Vinnie			Sure it was!

Vinnie			Get out of my way!

Brenda		Help!"

Elias			Come on! Come on!"

Dippy		This is going to take time. There is norwegium in these chains and it's almost impossible to drill.

Billy Bob		And Vinnie can show up any minute. 

Elias	 		Relax. We have a plan.

Vinnie			No, no, no!

Vinnie			I hate fish!

Vinnie			I hate fish!!

Gill			Fish! Food! Feast!

Gill			No more junk food for us!

Gull			This is the life!

Trigger		Look! A signal from Vinnie. He must be in some kind of trouble."

Vinnie			I really hate fish.

Grabber		Yuck! What happened to you?

Vinnie			These guys are totally crazy."

Helinor		You think we'r crazy? We aren't the ones who have chained two helpless boats in a cave to mine norwegium illegally!

Helinor		"But Elias and Dippy are in there right now, freeing them. Just wait until the Queen hears about this!"

Grabber		What's with you, boss?

Trigger		You could you let yourself be stopped by these tiny tubs?"

Trigger		And some wads of feathers?

Grabber		We have to stop them!"

Helinor		Everyone will know what you have done. Soon Dippy will have freed them from their chains."

Vinnie			What? Are they drilling inside the Black Hole?

Helinor		Yes. So what?"

Vinnie			The entire cave can collapse!

Helinor		Vinnie, you have to do something!

Stella			I hope the cave can withstand all this.

Stella			What was that?

Grabber		Shut your mouth, Black Hole, and swallow our secret forever!"

Vinnie			Hey, what are you doing?

Grabber		Ow! Not on me!

Grabber		You'll wreck my paint job.

Helinor		Vinnie, you have to make them stop!

Trigger		Check this out."

Vinnie			Stop!

Trigger/Grabber	Heh?"

Vinnie		This has gone too far. I don't want a bunch of small boats on my conscience."

Trigger		What's with you, boss? We're having a ball here. You're wrecking all our fun!"

Trigger		What's your problem?

Vinnie			Trigger, Grabber.

Vinnie			Go back to Big Harbor.

Vinnie			Now!

Grabber		Give me a break, old timer.

Vinnie			Use the net, Helinor!

Trigger/Grabber	Yikes! Heeelp!"

Elias			Listen. The booming sound has stopped"

Elias			The cave is collapsing! Swifty, take Stella and get out of here."

Stella			I'm not leaving without you and the others.

Elias			They're almost free. Leave, now!"

Elias			We'll be right behind you!

Elias			Come on. Come on!"

Helinor		Swifty, Stella, where are the others?

Elias			Don't give up! Come on! Come on!"

Elias			Come on! Come on! We can do it!"

Billy Bob		Finally.

Little Jane		We are free!"

Little Jane		We are free!

Elias			Good job!

Billy Bob		Incredible!

Elias			Quick, we have to get out of here!

Gerald			What's going on here?

Helinor		Elias and the others are about to be buried alive!"

Elias			No!

Elias			Oh, no!

Helinor		There you are. Thank goodness!"

Stella			But where is Elias?

Vinnie			No!

Stella			Elias!

Stella			Elias!

Elias			Hello?

Elias			Hello!

Stella			Elias, can you hear me?

Elias			Yes! Hello?"

Stella			Someone has to help him!

Vinnie			He saved me. Now it's my turn to save him!"

Vinnie			Elias, are you there?

Elias			Yes!

Vinnie			Come on, Elias. Before it's too late."

Elias			The opening is too low. I can't get out.

Vinnie			Lay over on your side and slide along my rail."

Vinnie			Do that trick you've been working on.

Elias			But I've never been able to get it right.

Vinnie			Then now would be a good time!

Elias			Ka-boom!

Stella			Elias, you did it!

Stella			Za-boom!

Gerald			Well done, Elias.

Gerald			Get out of here! Away! Away!

Stella			Wow!

Elias			Look! The northern lights!"

Elias			They're back!

Gill			I get so emotional.

Gull			Are you going to eat that herring?"

Queen of the Sea	"I would like to apologize to a little boat  who is not so little anymore.

Queen of the Sea	And not only once, but twice.

Queen of the Sea	First, Elias, I apologize for not believing in you."

Queen of the Sea	And second, I want to apologize for taking you away from Cozy Cove, because this is where you belong."

Queen of the Sea	So starting tomorrow, you are once again -"

Queen of the Sea	Cozy Cove's official rescue boat.

Queen of the Sea	And Gerald, you are needed back in Big Harbor.

Queen of the Sea	You have an entire armada -

Queen of the Sea	of rescue boats to train.

Gerald"		Yes, yes …"
Queen of the Sea	And the next time you visit Cozy Cove, -

Queen of the Sea	you'll find a brand new rescue-boat harbor."

Queen of the Sea	Isn't that right, Vinnie?

Vinnie			Vinnie, at your service!"

Queen of the Sea	And finally I have a very serious question:"

Queen of the Sea	Where's the party?

Brenda		Party!

Cruiser		Say what you will, we sure know how to throw a party in Cozy Cove!"

Elias			Look at those northern lights. They are so beautiful."

Stella			As beautiful as I am?

Stella			Come on, handsome!

Big Blinky		The northern lights -

Big Blinky		are a lot like friendship.

Trolley		Oh, how's that?"

Big Blinky		"It can shine bright and it can shine dimly."

Big Blinky		"Sometimes it can even vanish from view for a while."

Big Blinky		Only to suddenly appear again.

Big Blinky		And shine brighter than ever before.

Big Blinky		And when that happens ...

Big Blinky		It is magical.
	
Trawler		I should have gone to Brazil.
