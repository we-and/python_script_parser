MICHELLE	Are you finished yet?

RAIN	Woe is me, I’ve got a spectacularly talented daughter who is willing to spend hours memorializing me.

MICHELLE	Hours or eons? I can actually feel myself aging.

RAIN	You’re right. I’ll add wrinkles. Who knows how long that’ll take.

MICHELLE	Take a sweater.

RAIN	It’s ninety degrees. I’m already roasting.

MICHELLE	Feels good.

RAIN	For a sauna.

MICHELLE	Go get your sweater.

JOHN	You’re in a hurry.

RAIN	Don’t want to miss the bus.

JOHN	You want a ride?

RAIN	It’s okay.

JOHN	Alright. Lunch is in the fridge. And don’t forget your sweater. Love you.

JOHN	Rain...

RAIN	Hmm? Yeah, love you, too.

JOHN	This is John. How can I help you?

VICE PRINCIPAL	Hi, Mr. Burroughs, this is Vice Principal Sellars. We’re concerned that Rain didn’t make it into school today.

JOHN 	RAIN! RAIN?

RAIN	PLEASE! PLEASE DON’T! He’s coming for me!

MICHELLE	You’re making her worse! Don’t tie her down! 

MICHELLE	The medicine makes her a zombie. Of  course she’s going to try to wean herself off it.

JOHN	It doesn’t make any sense. She said she was feeling better.

DOCTOR	We see that regularly with schizophrenia. Patients take their medicine, feel better, and think they can go off it, but it can’t be cured. The best we can do is manage the symptoms with ongoing medications and psychotherapy.

JOHN	The best we can do? It’s been years, and this is the best we can do?! You’re supposed to be professionals!

MICHELLE	Jumping to anger isn’t

JOHN	I’m sorry, I know this isn’t your fault, but... She’s going to be an adult and then what? We lock her in her room for the rest of her life?

MICHELLE	John.

JOHN	There’s got to be something else.

DOCTOR	Short of admitting her to a psychiatric facility

MICHELLE	Absolutely not!

JOHN	That’s not an option for us.

DOCTOR	Her psychiatrist can try switching her to an atypical antipsychotic, which may have fewer side effects. I’d recommend something like Vraylar, which is effective in treating both schizophrenia and bipolar.	

MICHELLE	Hi, baby girl.

RAIN	I’m like a hermit crab. But I’m not a crab.

MICHELLE	Just a hermit?

RAIN	Is this happening?

MICHELLE	John, she’s awake...

JOHN	Oh, thank goodness. Honey, how are you feeling?

NURSE ROSA	Can I get you anything?

NURSE ROSA	Rain?

MICHELLE	Rain, you said you wanted something to sketch with, didn’t you?

RAIN	Wait...

RAIN	Can I have a pencil?

NURSE ROSA	We can’t give

MICHELLE	Just a soft sketch pencil.

NURSE ROSA	How about Crayons?

AIN	I don’t know what to say.

DR. PANGLOSS	Whatever comes to mind.

DR. PANGLOSS	Nothing?

RAIN	Too much.

DR. PANGLOSS	Let’s start with what you remember then. Do you recall anything that triggered it?

RAIN	I I don’t know. I remember going upstairs and then being on the bus.

DR. PANGLOSS	But you never left your house.

RAIN	I was in the woods, though. There was a man chasing me.

DR. PANGLOSS	Rain, these episodes get increasingly worse each time you try going off

RAIN	You don’t understand. I’m an artist. I get that the medicine could I don’t know, maybe make me more “stable”, but it makes me a zombie. I can’t paint if I can’t feel.

DR. PANGLOSS	I’m sure you’re perfectly capable

RAIN	I don’t want to live like that!

DR. PANGLOSS	We can keep experimenting until we find the right combination

RAIN	Experimenting? I’m not a lab rat!

DR. PANGLOSS	Not taking it isn’t an option. One more misstep and the state is going to institutionalize you, Rain. 

RAIN	It’s not fair... People see and hear God. No one says they’re nuts.

DR. PANGLOSS	That’s not the same thing.

RAIN	Why not?

RAIN	Is everything okay?

JOHN	Of course, monkey. Everything’s fine.

JOHN	Jack of all trades, huh?

DANI MCCONNELL	Master of none.

RAIN	What’s wrong?

MICHELLE	It’s just been a rough week.

RAIN	I’m sorry.

MICHELLE	No, no, no. Your dad and I just handle things differently.

DANI MCCONNELL	Looking forward to having you back in class, Rain.

RAIN	Grandma and grandpa?	

JOHN	Who else?

RAIN	Didn’t work.

JOHN	I’ll let you tell them.             For what it’s worth, they sent ‘good luck’ balloons when I told them I wanted to open my own  restaurant.

RAIN	Well, look how that ended up. Sold out.

JOHN	Your mom wasn’t into the idea of giving birth in the back of a kitchen.

RAIN	Women.

JOHN	Hey...

JOHN	Don’t worry about it. I’ll get it all put back together.

JOHN	Monkey, it’s okay. It’s going to be okay. Why don’t you stay in the guest room? Just until we get yours fixed back up.

JOHN	Rain...

JOHN	Rain, it’s going to be alright. I’m here, okay? It’s just me.

MICHELLE	I missed this.

JOHN	Is this... Okay, no. It’s fine. Yeah.

JOHN	You’re good with strawberry- pomegranate?

RAIN	Just a normal PBJ’s fine.

JOHN	This is normal, just spruced it up a bit. Come give it a

RAIN	I’m sure it’s

JOHN	I want you to have something spec

RAIN	Dad

JOHN	You know, you, you don’t have to

RAIN	Dad	

JOHN	No one is forcing you to go back this soon. You can take

RAIN	Dad!

RAIN	I love you, and I get that you’re worried, but you’ve got to let me try. I’m good. Okay?

RAIN	It’s not like I’m on drugs or anything.

RAIN	Best jelly I’ve ever had.

JOHN	It’s jam, made from fruit pulp as opposed to juice. Keep your phone on you. Charged. Make sure it’s charged.

RAIN	Done and done.

MICHELLE	Have a good day, hon.

RAIN	Love you.

JOHN	Your lunch

DANI MCCONNELL	Guys, we’ve got a lot to cover if any of you have a hope in hell of passing your finals.

DANI MCCONNELL	Welcome back, Rain. Care to join us?

DANI MCCONNELL	I’m gonna cut to the chase here. I need to see more quotes in your essays.

DANI MCCONNELL	You can’t just say “Heathcliff is a psycho.”

DANI MCCONNELL	Uh, well, I mean, ah... You can’t say “Heathcliff is a sadistic ass because he spent his entire life pining over a childhood crush and plotting against the man she ends up marrying.” And I’m not disagreeing with you.

DANI MCCONNELL	But back up your claims. Let’s get textual.

RAIN	Can I just have chicken? And guacamole?

RAIN	Sorry, I just have a strict diet. Medical stuff.

RAIN	Hey. I tried calling you the other day.

RAIN	I like your necklace.

ALEXA	It’s a choker.

RAIN	Oh. Can I

ALEXA	No room. Sorry.

ALEXA’S FRIEND 1	Not for all those personalities.

RAIN	That’s not even 

ALEXA	Careful, she’ll go all Carrie on us.

ALEXA’S FRIEND 1	Whoa.

ALEXA	Yeah, you wouldn’t even believe the stuff I’ve seen.

ALEXA’S FRIEND 2	I heard she tried to kill herself.

BOY	Hi. I’m Caleb.

CALEB	Pick a card, any card. Sounds cliche, but do it anyway.

CALEB	Come on, Rain.

CALEB	Tough crowd. Always is when there’s only one. Take one.

CALEB	They’re Tarot. Much more difficult. You remember your card?

CALEB	Okay, put it back in the deck. Now give them a shuffle.

CALEB	You’ve gotta stop talking.

RAIN	I don’t like magic.

CALEB	Good news is it’s not magic, it’s skill. Tap the top of the deck. See, this is the interactive part where I distract you and swap it so you’re really impressed when I flip over this top card and it’s yours.

CALEB	What? That’s not it?

CALEB	No, I know. You’re right. I just wanted to give you that one as a gift to balance out your own. Which is under your cup.

CALEB	Why haven’t I seen you before?

RAIN	What is this, twenty questions?

CALEB	Five, so far.

RAIN	I’ve been out sick. And you’re new. Where’re you from?

CALEB	Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Arizona, New Mexico.

RAIN	Must suck, leaving your friends.

RAIN	I’m going to go study. Got a lot to make up.

CALEB	Oh. Right. Okay. (beat) If you ever want to get coffee after school or something...

RAIN	I can’t drink coffee. Caffeine makes me...

CALEB	Me too. If you ever want to get not- coffee after school, let me know.

RAIN	Careful, mom.

MICHELLE	Thank you.

RAIN	Huh?

DANI MCCONNELL	Was just saying ‘hi’. Looks like you’re up.

RAIN	Picking up for Rain Burroughs. B-U- R-R-O-U-G-H-S.

RAIN	Thanks.

JOHN	As much as I’d love to, I don’t think now’s a good time to be taking on something like that. No, yeah, I’ve been wanting to get back into it, but	There’s just work’s hectic and I should be here at night in case anything happens again. Thanks for thinking of me, though.

RAIN	Dad...

JOHN	Rain. I I didn’t realize

RAIN	Who was that?

JOHN	Oh, Phil. It was nothing. He’s just putting a few events together this month and wanted me to cater them.

RAIN	You’re not going to?

JOHN	I don’t have time for that.

RAIN	You haven’t cooked in forever. You should do it.

JOHN	I do, I make stuff here all the time.

RAIN	Mom and I don’t count.

RAIN	I’ll be fine.

JOHN	You sure?

LITTLE GIRL	HELP!

MICHELLE	Rain?

RAIN	Mom? One second.

MICHELLE	Honey, your dad’s going to take the door off the hinges if you keep locking it.

RAIN	I know. It’s just habit. Sorry.

RAIN	Did you hear anything?

MICHELLE	How was your first day back?

RAIN	Great. Everyone thinks I’m a freak.

MICHELLE	I doubt that. Isn’t it cool to be different nowadays?

RAIN	Different like ‘I’m gender fluid and got sixteen nipple rings’, not ‘recently hospitalized for psychosis’.

MICHELLE	Sixteen nipples?

RAIN	This is the biggest event of the year for them. It’s ridiculous. Like, everyone knows. My teachers, everyone.

MICHELLE	It’s going to blow over. Someone will get a bad hair cut, or Alexa will make out with someone’s boyfriend and they’ll forget all about this.

MICHELLE	Whoa. What was that?

RAIN	She won’t even talk to me. She’s got new, cool friends who love hearing her horror stories of being around the crazy girl.

MICHELLE	Stop calling yourself

RAIN	It’s like I’m social currency. I don’t know. Whatever. Gives me more time to paint. I think maybe that’s what I want to study.

MICHELLE	In college?

RAIN	Mhmm.

RAIN	You don’t think I’ll get in.

MICHELLE	I didn’t know that’s what you wanted. I think... I think... It would be wonderful for you.

MICHELLE	Okay, you should get some sleep. Love you.

COACH	So I’m not gonna lie to you. I had a rough night. I figure we could all use the fresh air.

COACH	Come on. It’ll be nice. Take a little jog, expand those lungs.

ALEXA	Do we have to?

COACH	Unless you have a medical slip, yes. The sooner you get started, the sooner you’ll finish.

ALEXA	I have asthma. See?

COACH	Light exercise will be good for you.

COACH	Ready guys? And go.

RAIN	I’ll walk with you.

ALEXA	Uh. No thanks. I don’t want to catch your crazy.

COACH	Rain?

CALEB	Hey!

RAIN	What are you doing?

CALEB	Cutting class, I guess.

RAIN	Well stop.

CALEB	Stop what? P.E. isn’t going to help me do anything in life.

RAIN	I meant stop following me. 

CALEB	Whoa. Are you okay,

RAIN	No, I’m not okay. My best friend won’t even talk to me anymore.

CALEB	Why not?

RAIN	I don’t know.

CALEB	There has to be a reason.

RAIN	Okay, when I said I didn’t know, I meant I kind of do know, but I don’t want to talk about it.

CALEB	Fair enough. You wanna get out of here? I can take you home. Or wherever.

RAIN	Wherever?

RAIN	We’re gonna be pedaling this thing like the Flintstones.

CALEB	I’m still restoring it.

RAIN	How long has it been?

CALEB	A... while. I got it from a neighbor for a couple hundred bucks.

CALEB	It wasn’t running so I rebuilt the carburetor, new clutch, starter, new pads, rotors, replaced the rack and pinion, which took about six months. I ran out of money before I could get to body work, but at least it’s running.

RAIN	For now. Do you have any idea where we’re going?

CALEB	You said ‘wherever’.

RAIN	So is this what you want to do?

CALEB	What?

RAIN	Be a mechanic?

CALEB	Car mechanics and quantum mechanics aren’t closely related. Those are more like homonyms. Like to wave versus a wave.

RAIN	Oh.

CALEB	Shit. 

RAIN	What?
 
CALEB	It’s going to rain.

CALEB	We’re kinda stuck here for a bit.

RAIN	Why?

CALEB	My windshield wipers don’t work.

RAIN	Do you have to do that?

CALEB	What?

RAIN	Magic. Right now.

CALEB	It’s not magic. It’s skill. Puzzles, sleight of hand, all of it contingent on sleight of mind. Everything’s an illusion.

CALEB	Are you okay?

RAIN	Mhmm.

CALEB	You’re fidgeting, your face is flushed, and your breathing has become shortened. You’re afraid, but of what?

RAIN	Uh I You’re speaking so quickly.

CALEB	So it’s me? I have that effect on people sometimes. Because I don’t like just talking about inconsequential stuff like the weather.

CALEB	That would be ironic.

RAIN	Hmm?

CALEB	If it was the weather. Rain afraid of rain.

RAIN	It’s not that. I just... I want to get home.

RAIN	You didn’t have to get my door.

CALEB	I did. The passenger door won’t open from the inside.

RAIN	Oh.

CALEB	Sorry for wasting your day.

RAIN	You didn’t waste it.

CALEB	You don’t have to protect my feelings.

RAIN	Look, Caleb, I I’m 

RAIN	This was the best time I’ve had in as long as I can remember.

CALEB	We didn’t really do anything.

RAIN	Yeah.

CALEB	Have a good night.

RAIN	You, too.

RAIN	So, there’s something I need to tell you... I don’t want you to be freaked out or anything, but I’m sick. (beat) No, not like cancer. Like... In my head.

RAIN	Yeah...

JOHN	Rain?

RAIN	Yeah, dad?

JOHN	This thing’s gonna go late, but the guys will handle the clean up so I can get out of there. And I’ll have my phone on, okay?

RAIN	Sounds good.

MICHELLE	You’re gonna be late. I literally just told you to stop locking the door, Rain. I’m not going to tell you again.

MICHELLE	Where were you?

RAIN	At the library. Writing. Studying. I was studying.

MICHELLE	Mhmm. What’s his name?

RAIN	Who?

MICHELLE	You forget your dad and I used to be study buddies.

RAIN	Gross. His name’s Caleb.	

MICHELLE	Caleb, huh? That’s a good name. I’ve got to call your grandparents. You should help your dad  get ready.

RAIN	It’s not real. It’s not real!

JOHN	Rain? Are you okay?

RAIN	Did you hear that?!

MICHELLE	What? Hear what?

JOHN RAIN	They there’s a girl next door in the attic. A tiny, little girl.

JOHN	At Dani’s?

RAIN	Yes! She was screaming for help! Didn’t you hear it?

JOHN	No, sweetheart, I didn’t.

MICHELLE	Where did you see her?

RAIN	She was in the window.

JOHN	There’s nothing out there.

RAIN	It happened! I swear, I saw her with my own eyes. She was right there and then she grabbed her.

JOHN	Who?

MICHELLE	Ms. McConnell?

RAIN	I don’t know! I couldn’t see.

MICHELLE	Use your checklist, Rain.

JOHN	Is it possible? No. She doesn’t have kids.

RAIN	Yeah, that’s the point.

JOHN	This is ridiculous.

MICHELLE	Honey.

RAIN	We need to do something!

MICHELLE	What do you want to do?

RAIN	I don’t know! You guys need to go over there and see what’s going on.

JOHN	Alright, how about this? You try to go back to sleep and we’ll go over there tomorrow.

RAIN	On is good.

RAIN	Mom?
 
MICHELLE	Yeah?

RAIN	Can you stay with me?

MICHELLE	Of course, baby girl.

JOHN	Having second thoughts?

DANI MCCONNELL	Oh. Morning wasn’t expecting guests.

JOHN	Morning.

DANI MCCONNELL	Everything okay?

JOHN	Yeah. You got a minute?

DANI MCCONNELL	Sure. Come on in.

DANI MCCONNELL	Don’t mind the mess. I’m still trying to fix her up.

JOHN	You should see my place.

DANI MCCONNELL	I’ve seen your yard.

DANI MCCONNELL	So what can I do for you?

JOHN	This is gonna sound strange, but Rain heard some noises the other night and wanted to make sure everything was alright.

DANI MCCONNELL	What kind of noises?

RAIN	A little girl.

DANI MCCONNELL	A little girl... The folks across the street have kids. That’s probably what you heard.

RAIN	She’s lying!

JOHN	Rain.

RAIN	She’s in your attic! I saw her.

DANI MCCONNELL	Who? My attic? I do have an attic, but there’s no one up there.

DANI MCCONNELL	Not that I know of, anyway. I’m happy to take you up there.

JOHN	Thank you for the offer, but

RAIN	Yeah. I want to see.

DANI MCCONNELL	Sure, not a problem.  Don’t worry about it. I get it she’s had a rough go of things.

DANI MCCONNELL	Well this doesn’t make me look very good. Haven’t been up here since Gram passed.

JOHN	Quite a collection.

DANI MCCONNELL	She made each one by hand. Their clothes were much nicer than anything she ever made us.

DANI MCCONNELL	Sure does bring back memories.

JOHN	Rain!

DANI MCCONNELL	Oh, jeeze. Don’t worry about that. The hell’s that in there for anyway?

JOHN	You ood?

JOHN	We’ll get outta your hair. (aside) Thanks for humoring her.

DANI MCCONNELL	No problem. Better get back to that make up work, young lady.

RAIN	Humoring me, dad? Do you think this is a joke?

JOHN	Of course not, but

RAIN	She’s lying! Did you see the almanacs? There was one from 2018!

JOHN	So?

RAIN	She said she hadn’t been up there!

JOHN	Who gives a shit whether she’s been in her own attic, Rain?!

RAIN	You’re a fucking coward. You never believe me! You’re listening to someone you don’t even like!

JOHN	Yeah, I think she’s strange, but she sounds a lot more logical than you right now.

RAIN	Seriously? Can’t you give me the benefit of the doubt, just once?

JOHN	How am I supposed to do that?! Do you hear yourself?

RAIN	Of course not, because I’m crazy, right?

JOHN	STOP! You need to stop this! Everything was normal over there. Why can’t you get that through

RAIN	How would you feel if it was me up there?

JOHN	There was no one down there. This is just your head playing games with you.  MIND GAMES ITS A LOSING GAME YOURE LOSING THE GAME LOSER

JOHN	Rain, I’m serious. You need to stay away from that house. If she files a complaint, the state will have you put into a hospital. Promise me.

RAIN	Okay, daddy.

DR. PANGLOSS	How have you been feeling since you’ve been home?

RAIN	Better than being strapped down and experimented on.

RAIN	I don’t know. I mean, I can’t sleep, even though I’m taking my medicine, which I really don’t need in the first place.

DR. PANGLOSS	We’ve gone through this before, Rain.

RAIN	It’s not helping, and I just want to be myself.

DR. PANGLOSS	You realize if you choose to go off your medication, you’re likely to end up in an institution where they’ll force you to stay on it.

RAIN	I’m so sick of this. I know things are happening, but no one believes me. And then it makes me question whether it’s just in my head, even though I know it’s real. And I can feel my dad giving up on me.

DR. PANGLOSS	I can understand why those things are frustrating. Is there anything in particular that you’re unsure of?

RAIN	Do you think I’m stupid?

DR. PANGLOSS	Do you think I think you’re stupid?

RAIN	I know they tell you things.

DR. PANGLOSS	Who is ‘they’?

RAIN	They told you about the girl, right?

DR. PANGLOSS	What girl?

RAIN	My neighbor is keeping a little girl in her attic.

DR. PANGLOSS	Okay, Rain, this is not like your hallucinations of things you know are not real. This is a serious accusation that will have equally serious consequences for one of you.

RAIN	I’ve heard her screaming.

DR. PANGLOSS	Did you run through your questions?

DR. PANGLOSS	Has anyone else reacted to her?

RAIN	No, she’s keeping her hidden.

DR. PANGLOSS	Why would she do that?

RAIN	Because I don’t know! I think she kidnapped her. She’s keeping her chained up in there and she screams for help.

DR. PANGLOSS	Do you think it’s possible that you might be projecting your own fears of being confined or restrained?

PAINTING RAIN	DO SOMETHING! GET ME OUT OF HERE!

RAIN	Yeah.

DR. PANGLOSS	What’s that?

RAIN	Yeah... I guess it could be possible.

CALEB	The singularity is near.

CALEB	We’re all going to merge with artificial intelligence. Not me, ‘we’; them, ‘we’. I’ll be fine.

RAIN	How’s that?

CALEB	No social media. No cell phone.

RAIN	You don’t have a cell phone?

CALEB	Nope. If I did, I’d have asked for your number. But I don’t. Technological anarchy. Or at least as it pertains to radiofrequency radiation.

STUDENT COUNCIL CANDIDATE	Donut forget to vote for me!

RAIN	Where do you even learn about all of that stuff?

CALEB	You can find out anything online, if you know what to look for. Which, I guess, is pretty hypocritical of me.

RAIN	Let’s go eat outside.

CALEB	I’m more of an indoorsy type of

CALEB	Rain? Shh!

RAIN CALEB	What are you

RAIN	They’re going to take me away.

CALEB	What? Who?

RAIN	The cops! My neighbor she’s called the cops on me.

CALEB	I think they’re just on patrol.

RAIN	You don’t believe me?

CALEB	Uh I don’t know, I guess I do. But why would she do that?

RAIN	She needs to get rid of me. She kidnapped a little girl and is keeping her in her attic.

CALEB	What? Have you told the cops?

RAIN	I can’t.

CALEB	Why not?

RAIN	Because they’re on her side!

CALEB	Dude, this is insane.

RAIN	I know!

CALEB	Your neighbor has a kid chained in her attic and the cops are after you. Do you realize how this sounds?

RAIN	Yeah, I know! But have you seen the news? Look at Dahmer nobody would think that could happen, but he had neighbors. People are demented!

CALEB	Okay...

RAIN	I just need you to trust me.

CALEB	Okay. But if it’s true

RAIN	It’s true. I just need proof.

CALEB	Okay, alright, well... Maybe maybe I can help you out.

RAIN	You have ideas?

CALEB	Umm... Well...

CALEB	See? Helping you out.

CALEB	Meet me after school.

JOHN	Dammit.

DANI MCCONNELL	You need a hand?

JOHN	I think I’ve got it.

DANI MCCONNELL	Sure did some damage, huh?

JOHN	Yeah... Decided to take the day off work. Listen, Dani, I wanted to apologize for the other

DANI MCCONNELL	John, I understand. You’ve got a lot on your plate.

JOHN	It shouldn’t wind up on yours, though.

DANI MCCONNELL	Things don’t go the way we think they should. (beat) Well, you have a good one. Let me know if you need anything.

JOHN	Will do. Thanks.

ALEXA	Get in!

DR. PANGLOSS	Hi, Rain. It’s Dr. Pangloss. Wanted to see if you’re coming in for your appointment today.

CALEB	Where are you going?

RAIN	I thought you left.

CALEB	Well I did. Had to fill up. Sorry about that. Get in.

RAIN	Sorry. I kind of crushed it.

CALEB	Oh, that’s actually for you. I made it. I, uh, felt bad about earlier.

RAIN	What is it?

CALEB	Open it.

RAIN	Is it magic?

CALEB	No. You don’t like magic.

CALEB	It’s a neuron.

RAIN	Really?

CALEB	It’s kind of nerdy, but I guess I just like your brain.

RAIN	I love it.

RAIN	That’s her place.

CALEB	It’s nice.

RAIN	She inherited it. How are we going to do this?

CALEB	We uh sit. Watch her, figure out her schedule.

RAIN	She works Monday through Friday, from 7 to 4, and has a night class at HCC on Wednesdays from seven to eleven. That’s going to be our prime time.

RAIN	What? Did you think I’ve just been waiting for someone else to fix this?

CALEB	You play? She shakes her head.

CALEB	Good.

RAIN	I don’t think she’s home... Give me a hand.

CALEB	You don’t think?

CALEB	I’ll go.

RAIN	Anything?

CALEB	It’s not tall enough.

RAIN	Get down!

RAIN	We have to go inside.

CALEB	What?! No, I’m not breaking into someone’s house.

RAIN	I need to know.

CALEB	Rain!

CALEB	Why don’t we come back Wednesday when she’s at work?

RAIN	Who knows what could happen to her by Wednesday?!

RAIN	That’s new it was open before!

CALEB	(ready to go) Well, then

RAIN	We’ve got to find a screwdriver or something!

CALEB	Look. So?

RAIN CALEB	Maybe there is a kid up there...

RAIN	I found one!

RAIN	She’s back!

CALEB	What the hell, Rain?

RAIN	What?

CALEB	When you said she works Monday through Friday, you could’ve mentioned that it was at our school. This is really bad.

JOHN	Shit.

JOHN	God dammit!

RAIN	Dad?

RAIN	Here, let me help you.

JOHN	You’re going to help me?

JOHN	I’m sorry. That was I shouldn’t have Don’t do that.

RAIN	It’s fine.

JOHN	I can do it.

RAIN	So can I!

JOHN	I know. You’re This is my fault. The paint just spilled.

RAIN	Did it? Because it looks like you threw it.

JOHN	I’m not the painter.

RAIN	You can say that again.

RAIN	Walls don’t bleed. Walls don’t bleed, Rain.

MICHELLE	Sorry. I was

RAIN	You scared me!

MICHELLE	I didn’t mean to.

RAIN	Are you

MICHELLE	I wanted to see what you’re seeing.

RAIN	Be careful what you wish for.

MICHELLE	So when do I get to meet this Caleb?

RAIN	Probably never.

MICHELLE	Why?

RAIN	It’s not a lie.

MICHELLE	I didn’t say it was.

RAIN	I know what you’re thinking.

MICHELLE	What?

RAIN	You want to know if he’s real.

RAIN	Honestly, I don’t know if he is or not. And I don’t care. I like being with him, even if he’s an illusion.

MICHELLE	It’s not healthy for you, though.

RAIN	How do you know? You have no idea what it’s like, not having anyone to talk to. I finally have someone to keep me company and he’s not hurting me. Or anyone else. So why would it be a problem?

MICHELLE	It just... It could be triggering. And you know you can always talk to me.

RAIN	It’s not the same.

MICHELLE	Why? Because I’m real?

MICHELLE	I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that.

RAIN	It’s fine. I just wish... I don’t know, like, I want to get better, I do, but honestly, I don’t want to lose it all.

MICHELLE	I know, baby. I know.

RAIN	Let’s skip class and go back to her place.

CALEB	You’re joking, right?

RAIN	No.

CALEB	I’m not going to break into my teacher’s house, Rain!

RAIN	You kind of already did.

CALEB	Well I’m not doing it again. Can’t we just hang out and do something normal?

RAIN	I can’t really think about anything else right now.

CALEB	Wait. I’ve got an idea... One that doesn’t involve doing anything illegal. Meet me in the library at lunch, okay?
RAIN	So much for your technological anarchy...

CALEB	It’s more specific to cell phones. RF energy, addiction they literally cause electrophysiological changes in the brain. Computers are a different story. You said you saw her, right?

RAIN	I’ve been searching online for the last two weeks. We’re not going to find her.

CALEB	You’re severely underestimating my skills here. How old would you say she was?

RAIN	I don’t know. They all look the same. She’s little. Three, maybe four? Big eyes.

CALEB	There are so many of them.

RAIN	The world is full of monsters.

CALEB	How is there no a filter by age? We’ll just have to search through everyone who has gone missing in the last four, five years, by state. Start with Florida and move outwards.

CALEB	Any of them look familiar?

RAIN	Wait. Go back up.

RAIN	Oh my God.

CALEB	Malia Robinson, five years old, believed to have been abducted from her home. Missing from Pender County since February.

RAIN	That’s her. That’s the little girl.

CALEB	Are you sure?

RAIN	Yeah. Oh my God. This is amazing. You’re amazing. We I need to call her parents.

CALEB	Hold on. What are you going to say?

RAIN	I’m going to tell them I found her!

CALEB	Is that

RAIN	I’m freaking out right now. I need I need something to drink.

CALEB	Do you want me to

RAIN	Find their contact information. I’ll be right back.

ALEXA	Why are you taking it out on me? I’m not the one who left. Hello? Hello?

RAIN	Is everything okay? 

ALEXA	My parents are they won’t even speak to each other and I’m not going to be able to afford college and it’s not fair! It’s not my fault!

ALEXA	I feel like I can’t breathe and I

RAIN	Here, let me

ALEXA	STOP! Get away from me!

RAIN	I think she’s having a panic attack.

ALEXA	Just because you’re schizophrenic doesn’t mean the rest of us are fucked up, too!

CALEB	It doesn’t bother me, you know...I just wish you had told me what it was.

RAIN	They’ve diagnosed me with so many things, I don’t know what to believe anymore. If you don’t want to be friends anymore after this, I’ll understand.

CALEB	You want to grab some food?

CALEB	So... I don’t want to be insensitive, so just feel free to tell me to shut up, but what’s it like?

RAIN	What do you mean?

CALEB	Like, what do you see? How often? Do you hear voices? I don’t know. I want to know everything.

RAIN	Okay, that’s a lot.

CALEB	Sorry, am I being rude?

RAIN	No, no, not at all. So, number one: I don’t have multiple personalities  people assume that, but it’s completely different.

CALEB	Oh. So just Rain.

RAIN	Well, not exactly. There are a lot of voices, saying the worst things you could imagine. Or that I could. To be honest, it’s scary, not being able to trust what I see or hear.

RAIN	Most people don’t actually have visual hallucinations, just auditory ones. I’ve got both. Which creates issues with totally normal things, like mirrors.

CALEB	Mirrors are scary?

RAIN	Yeah. I know. It’s... It’s a lot.

CALEB	But it’s what makes you, you. You’re different. I’m different. Why should we apologize for that? No one apologizes for having diabetes or or tuberculosis?

CALEB	Hey, Rain? It’s okay if she’s not real...

MICHELLE	Hey. You’re back late.

RAIN	It’s only seven. Did you do anything today? (beat) Mom, if I can get out and socialize, you can, too.

MICHELLE	I’m proud of you.

JOHN	Monkey, I’ve got a surprise for you.

JOHN	Ta-da. What do you think?

RAIN	It’s nice.

JOHN	You remember that day?

RAIN	Yeah. You and mom looked so happy.

MICHELLE	What are you doing, silly girl?

CHILD RAIN	Come on, mom!

RAIN	I think I’m going to stay in the other room for now.

RAIN	Mom? What are you doing in here? What’s wrong?

RAIN	Is it something I did?

RAIN	I’m sorry, mom. I’m sorry I’m messed up.

MICHELLE	No, baby. It’s not you.

RAIN	I’m trying, mom. I am. I’m going to try for you. I’m going to be better.

CALEB	Like taking candy from a baby. Right, McConnell?

CALEB	Psst. Hey.

DANI MCCONNELL	Turn in last night’s homework on your way out. I didn’t forget.

JOHN	Oh, honey, I’m sorry

RAIN	Don’t worry about it. Just a cut. I was worried you were mom. I’m making dinner to cheer her up.

JOHN	Oh. That’s nice. What’s this?

RAIN	Ranch.

JOHN	Buttermilk aioli.

JOHN	Pan-roasted, leavened bread with herb-infused tomato puree and a blend of artisanal cheeses.

RAIN	She’s coming! Distract her.

MICHELLE	What’s going on?

RAIN	Nothing. Just don’t come in here.

MALE VOICE	Rain.

MALE VOICE	Rain!

RAIN	What are you doing here?

CALEB	You’ve been ignoring me.

RAIN	Yeah.

CALEB	Yes you wait, I wasn’t expecting you to come right out and admit it.

RAIN	Well, I did. And I have been ignoring you because you’re not real.

CALEB	Yeah I am

RAIN	You’re in prison. You’re a prism.

CALEB	Huh?

RAIN	Number one: is it possible? The answer is no. You’re not possible. No one like you actually exists in real life, and it’s time for you to go away.

CALEB	What makes you think I’m not real?

RAIN	Everything. I don’t know. You’re too perfect.

CALEB	Perfect? That’s a first.

RAIN	Well, perfectly imperfect. I don’t want to keep talking to you about this.

CALEB	Too bad. I’m not leaving.

RAIN	Why not?

CALEB	Because It’s hard enough to make friends, and I really like you.

RAIN	You no, stop. You need to go, whether you’re real or not.

CALEB	I am real. I know you’re different and I don’t care, okay? Actually, no, I do care, and I like it.

CALEB	What the hell is that?

RAIN	You heard her?

CALEB	I heard something.

RAIN	It was Malia!

CALEB	Rain, I don’t know what that was. Maybe it was a cat...

RAIN	It wasn’t a cat!

CALEB	Then we need to call the police.

RAIN	I can’t!

CALEB	We have to! This is too much.

RAIN	You just said it could’ve been a cat. If I’m wrong, they’ll put me away.

CALEB	Aghh I don’t know what to do.

CALEB	Let’s try to get in through the garage.

CALEB	Rain!

POLICE OFFICER	Are you the father of Rain Burroughs?

DANI MCCONNELL	Enough is enough, John!

JOHN	What’s going

DANI MCCONNELL	It’s one thing when she’s “having issues”, but now she’s vandalizing my home and making accusations that could end my career!

JOHN	Whoa, whoa, hold on. Let’s just

DANI MCCONNELL	I’ve worked my ass off for my retirement and I can’t afford to have that jeopardized.

JOHN	What do you want me to do?

DANI MCCONNELL	You know what you need to do.

JOHN	I don’t. I really don’t. If you have the answer, I’d love to hear it.

DANI MCCONNELL	You need to put her in a hospital.

JOHN	Lock her away? That’s what you want me to do? Sweep my own daughter under the rug?

DANI MCCONNELL	I get that you’re in a tough place, but if you’re not going to take her in, I’m filing charges.

JOHN	Dani, please

JOHN	I told you not to go over there! What the hell were you thinking?

MICHELLE	John...

RAIN	She has a giant doll house in her garage!

JOHN	And she’s got a hundred dolls in her attic. She’s weird. Who the hell cares?

RAIN	This is all her plan! She’s going to trap her in there!

JOHN	LISTEN TO YOURSELF!

RAIN	No, no! That’s what she wants! She wants you to think I’m crazy so she can get rid of me.

JOHN	You broke into someone’s house!

RAIN	That wasn’t me. Caleb broke the window.

JOHN	Christ, this again. Rain, she only reported seeing you.

RAIN	She may not have seen him, but he was there. He heard her scream!

JOHN	Caleb doesn’t fucking exist, Rain! You need to stop this!

RAIN	Stop what? If I weren’t sick, you’d never

JOHN	You are sick!

RAIN	But I’m not my sickness!

JOHN	You are! We all are! You’re going to Westbrook.

MICHELLE	Don’t you dare say that!

RAIN	Dad, no!

MICHELLE	I can’t do this anymore. You’re out of control, both of you.

JOHN	Have you been taking your medicine?

JOHN	Have you?

RAIN	Doesn’t matter what I say, you never believe me! Caleb believes me-

JOHN	Take your medicine.

RAIN	I’ve already taken it today.

JOHN	Take another dose.

RAIN	No!

RAIN	Is this what you want? You want me to just take them all, get out of your hair for good.

JOHN	I’m sorry. Please don’t say that. Please don’t ever say that. I just I don’t know what more I can do. I’m sorry.

RAIN	Sorry doesn’t make it okay.

CALEB	What are we going to do?

RAIN	Nice of you to show up after your disappearing act.

CALEB	You ran, I ran.

RAIN	She called the cops. She’s filing charges to have me sent away.

CALEB	What? Where?

RAIN	I’ve gotta go to class.

CALEB	Wait. If you’re going away, what’ll happen to Malia?

RAIN	You mean the cat next door?

RAIN	We’ve maybe we just climb up the ladder, break the window.

CALEB	While she’s home? That’s not going to do any good. She’ll just catch

RAIN	We’ve got to do something before she kills her!

CALEB	What makes you think she’s going to kill her?

RAIN	She knows I know! She’s going to kill her and it’ll be my fault!

CALEB	Rain... We need to come up with a coherent plan. Panicking isn’t going to help. Let me get you a glass of water.

RAIN	Wrong one.

CALEB	You take all of those?

RAIN	Not all of them. They’re always changing things around to see what’s most effective. I can’t sleep on any of them, though.

CALEB	Supposedly they’ve identified strong links between intellect and insomnia.

RAIN	Yeah, I’m sure that’s what it is. Just me being a genius.

RAIN	How can you be playing cards right now, knowing

CALEB	They help when I’m nervous. Here, pick a card.

RAIN	No. You pick a card.

CALEB	What’re you going to do with those?

RAIN	Just pick one.

MICHELLE	Rain?

RAIN	Yeah, mom?

MICHELLE	Oh I’m sorry. Who is this?

RAIN	This is Caleb. Caleb, this is my mom. Wait you can see him? You’re not just pretending?

MICHELLE	Of course I can see him.

RAIN	Sorry. I was so worried never mind.

MICHELLE	Well, don’t let me interrupt your date.

RAIN	It’s not a date. We’re just friends.

RAIN	We can’t keep waiting. How about Wednesday, after she leaves for her class?

CALEB	I should get going.

RAIN	Oh, okay...

MICHELLE	This is my fault.

DANI MCCONNELL	Rain?

DANI MCCONNELL	Whoa. Are you okay?

DANI. MCCONNELL	Can we talk for a moment?

DANI. MCCONNELL	Rain?

DANI. MCCONNELL	Rain, I think you should see the nurse.

MICHELLE	You’ve reached the Burroughs residence

RAIN	I need to see Dr. Pangloss.

RECEPTIONIST	She’s over at the hospital, Ms. Burroughs. I can let her know you’d like to speak with her.

RAIN	No, no, I need to see her now.

RECEPTIONIST	She’s not here. She should be back any m

RAIN	DR. PANGLOSS! DR. PANGLOSS! IT’S RAIN!

RAIN	Dr. Pangloss, please!

CHILDISH VOICE	Rain.

RAIN	It’s not real.

RAIN   REFLECTION	She’s going to die and you’re going to be locked up where you belong.

RAIN	Shut up!

RAIN – REFLECTION	They’re better off without you.

RAIN	STOP!

MICHELLE	Rain?

MICHELLE	Rain? Honey?

MICHELLE	Rain, baby, put that down.

RAIN	I saw a man with yellow eyes. He wants to take me for his prize. Cries. She cries. Cry me a river and watch me drown. Down, down, down. Into the ground, no sound. IT’S ALL TOO LOUD.

MICHELLE	It’s okay, honey. Drop the knife. Drop the knife, okay, hon?

MICHELLE	You’re safe. You’re safe now.

RAIN	...But Malia...

RAIN	Hey. I don’t have time to type all of this, so... Okay, I don’t know if it was too much for you, with my mom catching us, or if it was the card that freaked you out, but I can’t wait any longer. Malia needs help and I’m going with or without you.

MICHELLE	I’m not going to let you

RAIN	Let me what? This is your fault in the first place! I wouldn’t be dealing with all of this if you hadn’t made me sick!

RAIN	I hate you.

MICHELLE	You don’t mean that.

RAIN	Yes I do!

MICHELLE	Honey, please, you can’t go over there! They’ll take you away from us.

RAIN	I don’t care! What if it was me? I’m not just going to sit around and wait.

JOHN	Rain. Rain! Open the door!

RAIN	Mom’s making a big deal out of this and

JOHN	Rain, we need to talk, honey. Move away from the window. Please.

RAIN	I’m not going to jump! I was just trying to You ruin everything!

JOHN	Rain, no one is there.

RAIN	She is! She’s in there.

JOHN	Your mom, Rain. She’s not here.

JOHN	She passed away three years ago, 

RAIN	No. That’s not true.

JOHN	It is. I’m sorry.

RAIN	No it’s not!

RAIN	Stop! Why are you doing this to me?

JOHN	It’s not anything I’m trying to do to you. You need to know the truth.

RAIN	But what about  what about the other night at dinner? She was there. We were all there. Is anyone else reacting? Yes, dad. You were.

RAIN	She’s coming! Distract her.

MICHELLE	What’s going on?

RAIN	Nothing. Just don’t come in here.

JOHN	Monkey, I was just trying to...

RAIN	This whole time?

JOHN	I didn’t know what to do when you started seeing her again. I tried at first, reminding you she was gone, but it was so hard to see you relive the loss over and over again. But after a while... Your reality with her seemed so much happier than mine without her and I was so afraid I was so terrified you’d want to go, to be with her.

RAIN	How do I know you’re not lying now?

JOHN	Rain...

RAIN	How do I know you’re not just messing with my head?

JOHN	Why would I do that?

RAIN	Why would you lie to me to begin with? You’re trying to get into my head, aren’t you?

JOHN	I’m calling 9-1-1.

RAIN	NO!

JOHN	Rain!

DANI MCCONNELL	Malia’s already dead!

JOHN	Rain!

RAIN	Shut up!

RAIN	Malia?

RAIN	Malia? It’s okay... I’m here to help you.

YOUNG RAIN	SAVE ME!

RAIN	Stop! You’re hurting me.

YOUNG RAIN	You’re hurting ME! Rain pulls away forcefully.

RAIN	You’re not real. I have to save Malia.

YOUNG RAIN	There is no Malia! It’s only ever been me.

RAIN	No. No! She’s real!

RAIN	MOM!

MICHELLE	You did this to me.

RAIN	No.

MICHELLE	LOOK AT ME! You can’t leave me.

RAIN	I don’t want to. I’m sorry. I don’t want you to go away.

MICHELLE	I don’t have to.

RAIN	But I don’t want to be crazy, mom.

RAIN	Malia.

MICHELLE	She’s made up, Rain.

RAIN	No, mom, she’s not. You are.

RAIN	MALIA?!

DANI MCCONNELL	Keep the change.

RAIN	Stop! STOP IT!

RAIN	Malia?

RAIN	Malia! Can you hear me?

RAIN	Malia? I’m gonna get you out of here.

RAIN	You’re safe baby girl, okay?

DANI MCCONNELL	Hello?

DANI MCCONNELL	I know you’re down here.

DANI MCCONNELL	Oh. Rain. You scared the hell out of me.

DANI MCCONNELL	I’m trying to help you! She’s not real, Rain.

DANI MCCONNELL	She’s not real. You made her up in your head. Put that down. Let me help you.

DANI MCCONNELL	Does your dad know you’re here?

RAIN	I I don’t think so. No.

DANI MCCONNELL	I don’t have to tell him. We can keep this between us, okay?

RAIN	Why? Why would you do that?

DANI MCCONNELL	Because I know what happens when they institutionalize people. I don’t want that to happen to you. You’ve been through so much already.

RAIN	Yeah, I I don’t know what to believe anymore.

DANI MCCONNELL	You’ve seen that she’s not real. There is no little girl. You can go home now and we’ll never talk about it again.

CALEB	Rain?

RAIN	Caleb, don’t come down here. 

CALEB	Malia! You found her!

DANI MCCONNELL	Who are you talking to? There’s no one there, Rain! This is your head!

RAIN	Caleb!

RAIN	Stop! Please!

DANI MCCONNELL	Make a decision, Rain. A figment of your imagination, or the real thing?

DANI MCCONNELL	Did you think you were going to get away with this?

DANI MCCONNELL	I would’ve let you go. I didn’t want anyone to die. But you couldn’t leave things be, could you?

CALEB	Go! Get her out of here!

RAIN	Malia!

RAIN	Caleb!

MAN	Rain!

JOHN	It’s just me. You’re safe.

RAIN	Daddy.

JOHN	I’m so sorry. I should’ve believed you.

RAIN	I need to go back in Caleb...

JOHN	Honey. He’s not...

RAIN	It’s going to be okay. They’re going to take good care of you and bring you back to your mom and dad. I promise.

JOHN	I’m so proud of you, Monkey.

CALEB	When you said that wasn’t a date, what did you mean? Because it felt date-y to me.

RAIN	Did it?

CALEB	Yeah. Granted, I don’t have much experience with that sort of thing, but... Maybe we can have more of those things?

RAIN	Dates?

CALEB	Yeah, those.

RAIN	We might be able to arrange for that.

JOHN	You sure about this?

JOHN	Are you... You’re doin’ alright?

RAIN	I feel... Yeah, I am. This is the first time I’ve felt the medicine working. I can finally tell the difference between what’s real and what’s not.

JOHN	Good. Yeah, that’s good. What about Do you The voices, are they

RAIN	They’re still there, but they’re not as “agahhh” (she makes an overwhelming sound).

JOHN	What about mom?

RAIN	I miss her.

JOHN	Do you still see her?

RAIN	No.

RAIN	I think I’m going to move back into my room.

JOHN	Oh. Yeah, sounds like a plan.

MICHELLE	It’s okay, sweetheart.

MICHELLE	I’m here, baby girl. I love you so, so much.

RAIN	I love you, too.

RAIN	What? It’s not like you actually need them.
