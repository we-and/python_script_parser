MIRROR MAZE OWNER	It's coming back, I can feel it in my bones.

PUPPET	Yeah and it’s your fault that everything’s starting over again.

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	I’m just doing my duty.

PUPPET			Coward!

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	Shut your mouth! Move it, otherwise it’ll all fall apart - give me a hand!

PUPPET			If it were up to me it would be shattered right now.

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	Ahhhhhh

PUPPET	It's blinking did you see that? Your mirror has already found another victim.

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	Shut your mouth!

PUPPET			And no one knows how it’ll end...

ANNOUNCER	We interrupt this program for a short announcement: An unknown flying object has been sighted flying over the city. Peter Toennieshen is on site. Hello Peter, what can you tell us?

PETER	It's incredible. The majority of eyewitnesses claim to have seen a flying closet.

VOICES (female)		From the south in the direction of Rummel. 

VOICES (Male)	No it came from the airport. I said to my wife, a flying  closet? What the hell? What do the security forces say?

GESA	Frido! It’s already a quarter to eight, you’re going to be late for school. Oh no...

FRIDO				That wasn't me! - It just happened.

GESA				Just like that, yeah right!

FRIDO				Yes just like that! It just broke all on it's own!

GESA	Have you brushed your teeth? Come now. You'll be late for your German test.

FRIDO				Oh, stupid German!

GESA	Hey, you've got this... You've studied so much! (Yell-raspberry) You've got this, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it! 

FRIDO				Okay.  Morning, Mrs Pietsch!

MRS PIETSCH			Hey hold your horses young man! Get to school.

BOCKI				Hey look who's coming!

JARO				Fridolin Schubert, you stop right there!

BOCKI				Yeah.

FRIDO	Hey, screw you! How do you get your brain to the size of a pea? By pumping it up! (Laugh) 

JARO	You won't be laughing next time! You'll be paying protection money!

BOCKI				Yeah right!

EMILS MOTHER		Do you have your anti-allergy snack? Emil-Leopold?

EMIL				Yes mom I've got it. 

EMILS MOTHER	And hopefully you've got your "You-know-what", long underwear?

EMIL				Got it.

EMILS MOTHER	And during the break, please stay inside, are you listening? I don't want you to catch a cold again. Is that clear? Do you hear, Emil-Leopold?

EMIL				Yes.

EMILS MOTHER	And what is our motto? To achieve the possible, you always have to... ...attempt the impossible!

EMIL	To achieve the possible, you always have to... ...attempt the impossible!

EMILS MOTHER	Yes. You're all impossible too. What's up with the car this time? I have to go. 

EMIL				(Ugh!)

FRIDO				Morning, Mrs Langhals-Diestelmeier.
	
EMILS MOTHER		Morning Frido.

EMIL				Thanks!

FRIDO				Hey no worries! I hope I don't blow the German test.

EMIL				Crap, you'll do just fine!

KLAWITTER	Just ten more minutes. Jan, you need to write inside here. No one can read in there!

FRIDO				Oh crap. Here take that...

EMIL 	Uhm Miss Klawitter, I messed up my paper, is it possible I can get a new one?

KLAWITTER			Just this once Emil but only because it's you.

EMIL				Thank you!

FRIDO				Thanks. Man without you I would've bombed that test!

EMIL				Hey no worries.

FRIDO	Are you coming to the pool with us today?  We've got everything we need !

EMIL	(Blow nose) Brief analysis of the overall situation: I can't come. Today I have violin lessons, Chinese lessons and ergotherapy.

SEBI				Hey Frido, are you coming or hanging out with that weirdo?!

DUNJA				Man Sebi, leave Emil alone.

SEBI				Whatever. It's all good. We'll wait over there.

FRIDO				I'll be right there!

EMILS MOTHER	Emil-Leopold! Will you please come? And don't be sitting on those cold stones.

EMIL				Well. See you tomorrow at the parents day.

FRIDO				Yeah with Klawitter-Critter!

EMILS MOTHER	You'll get a bladder infection. You know that already... How often do I have to tell you that?

SEBI				What do cannibals call cyclists?

DUNJA				Meals on wheels! What sits on a tree and cries?

FRIDO				A howl! (Laugh)

BOCKI 				That one. The kid with the scooter.

JARO				Why him? Why'd you go after him?

FRIDO				Are you ready yet?

DUNJA				Yes almost.

FRIDO				Got it?

DUNJA				Yes

FRIDO				And... action. What's the name of this gymnastics exercise?

DUNJA				The scented candle!

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	Well, what do we have here? A school test.

PUPPET			Fridolin Schubert.

KLAWITTER			Goodbye. And next please. Ah the Schuberts...

GESA	Yes, uhm good day Mrs Klawitter. His father has another appointment.

FRIDO				Hello Mrs Klawitter

KLAWITTER			You wait outside okay?!

MICHAEL			Yeah, excuse me. Hello.

GESA				Where is my car?

MICHAEL			Uh, yeah I'll explain, it's a long story. You alright?

KLAWITTER	I don't really know how to put this but Fridolin is much too playful for a fourth grader.

GESA	Yes I know...But how do you see his prospects? I mean with regard to him progressing further with his schooling.

KLAWITTER	Fridolin needs to be much more disciplined. He arrives late and his work is sloppy, he forgets his homework and his imagination runs away with him.

MICHAEL	Excuse me, but having an imagination is hardly a bad thing surely?

KLAWITTER	Fridolin has to learn to write the numbers inside the boxes. Have you considered the possibility of ergotherapy? That could help him to concentrate more in class?

GESA				Yes?

KLAWITTER			Maybe it has something to do with your divorce?

GESA				Yeah maybe.

MICHAEL			Maybe it has something to do with your teaching?

KLAWITTER			At any rate I don't see Fridolin as High School material. 

GESA				Not even with a good German test result?  We studied so hard.

KLAWITTER	Fine then we'll wait and see. But his overall performance has got to improve or it's off. I don't believe in miracles, but I have heard of children who suddenly turn things around.

GESA				That just means you have to go to Seibert three times a week.

FRIDO	I don't want tutoring three times a week. I won't have anymore time left to play.

GESA	Yes but do you want to be the only student not going up to High School?

MICHAEL	Come on, the only one? I don't think Sebi's gonna make it either. In anycase: Have you thought about the fact that he could end up hating High School?  Maybe he doesn't even want it!

GESA				Frido, do you want to go to High School?

FRIDO				What?

GESA 				Do you want to go to High School?

MICHAEL			Do you want to go to High School?

GESA				With Emil and all the others?

FRIDO				Yeah sure. But...

GESA				There you go.

MICHAEL			Yeah because you've talked him into it.

GESA				Michael this is about Frido's future.

MICHAEL			Future...  You okay?

GESA				Yes.

MICHAEL			You really do carry around a lot of stuff, do you know that?

GESA				Careful, careful, you're going to mess everything up! Wait.

MICHAEL			You didn't used to be so uptight...

GESA	Very funny! Some people simply take control. Become responsible and grow up.

MICHAEL	What has that to do with Frido, hm? Oh I see, like loser father like loser son, that right?

GESA				Yes exactly that's what I'm trying to prevent...

FRIDO				Mom, will you guys stop... will you guys stop... please.

MICHAEL	You just want to be the perfect mother..With the most perfect offspring.

GESA				Like you would know what it's like?

MICHAEL			Frido?

GESA				Frido?

MICHAEL			Open the damn door now!

GESA				Frido! Stop!

MICHAEL 			Frido!

GESA				Frido! Frido!

MICHAEL			Frido, wait!

GESA				Oh damn, help, my receipts!

MICHAEL 			Who cares, it's not important! Come now!

GESA				Frido!

MICHAEL			Frido!

GESA				Frido!

GESA				Have you seen a young boy around here?

MICHAEL			Have you seen a young boy around here?

MICHAEL			Frido!

GESA				Frido!

MICHAEL			Hang on. I'll go this way.

GESA				And I'll go aroung there.

MICHAEL			Okay fine!

GESA				Frido!

MICHAEL 			Frido!

FRIDO	Fridolin must learn to write the numbers inside the box. Fridolin, is much too playful. Fridolin has problems with concentrating.  AHHHH Yeah right, Loser dad loser kid.

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	Stop bugging me, what is it this time?

PUPPET			Did you hear that? There's somebody here.

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	You're hearing ghosts. There's nobody here! 

PUPPET	Then I'm warning this nobody here that this is not a playground. Get lost as fast as you can!

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	Oh shut your mouth! And give me a hand here.

FRIDO				Tsssh, perfect yeah right. (Reacs and breaths, follow pic)

FRIDO				(Reacs and breaths, follow pic) Laugh

FRIDO				He-Hello?

FRIDO II	Hello Frido! I'm your reflection. I'm you but perfect. I can do everything you can't do.

FRIDO				AAAAAH!

GESA				Frido! Micha! You can't just take off and dissappear like that!

MICHAEL			Hey, Frido!

FRIDO				There was... My reflection... it was alive... and it could...

GESA				Oh Frido!

FRIDO				Yes but it's true! I'll show you!

PUPPET	Come on in! Just come in, take a look around, there's a lot to see!

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	No, I'm sorry, we haven't opened yet.

GESA	You see. We're going home now. I'll cancel all my appointments. Come.

FRIDO				Hey...but...but...

GESA				Come.

PUPPET			A nice young boy and you let him walk straight into the trap.

FRIDO				(Filter) And action!

DUNJA	(Filter) And... action. What's the name of this gymnastics exercise?

FRIDO				(Filter) The Scented candle!

FRIDO				Hello?

FRIDO II	(Reverb Filter) Hello Frido! I'm your reflection. I can do everything you can't do.

FRIDO				(Sigh)

KLAWITTER	Fridolin?...this won't get you into High School. You do understand that? Hm?  Emil, an "A" as always. And with tricks like that you're not helping Fridolin.

EMIL				Frido. Frido, we can do this.

FRIDO	Now my mother's going to insist I do more tutoring with Seibert.

SEBI				Hey come on High School is made for a bunch of nerds anyway. 

DUNJA				Shut your mouth!

SEBI				Oh and for Dunja as well.

DUNJA				Very funny Sebi.

OTTO				It's better to be funny than a boring nerd.

SEBI				And a loser at sport

JULI				Hey leave Emil alone.

EMIL				Frido, we can handle it, okay? We have to stay together!

FRIDO				But Siebert still sucks!

EMIL	You have to make it!  And you have to to put some effort into it!

FRIDO				Do you think I'm not doing that?

EMIL	Hey, no... What I mean is... maybe Seibert can teach you to be better and faster. It's all a matter of technique! It has to be perfect!

EMILS MOTHER		Emil-Leopold! We have to go to ergotherapy! 

EMIL				Yeah well bye!

FRIDO				Bye.

FRIDO II			Hello.

FRIDO				Hello.

FRIDO II			Here I am. At your service. I am perfect.

FRIDO	Wow that's really... totally wild. W-what do you mean by..."at your service" and "I'm perfect" and stuff?

FRIDO II	I already explained all of that last time: I can do everything that you can't do.

FRIDO				This, this is my test paper – and it's all correct.
	
FRIDO II			I can do math too.

FRIDO				Okay, what's 3 times 7?

FRIDO II			21.

FRIDO				Uh 13 times 15?

FRIDO II 			195.

FRIDO				Uhm... 8 times 16 plus 12 divided by 7?

FRIDO II	20. As of tomorrow you'll be getting straight A's. Of course only if you're okay with me going to school for you?.

FRIDO				You want to go to school for me? – Voluntarily?

FRIDO II			Gladly.

FRIDO				That'd be awesome!

FRIDO II			Pssst.

FRIDO				Are you like a good fairy?

FRIDO II 			I am the perfect you. I simply love to learn.

FRIDO 				I simply love to learn...? And where will you live

FRIDO II 			At your house!

FRIDO				Hey, wait!
_________________________________________________________________________

FRIDO 				Emil is going to faint when he sees you!

FRIDO II	Nobody can find out about this. That's rule number one. Hey careful!

FRIDO				Emil won't tell he's my best friend.

FRIDO II	If we're found out it's all over. It's better that no one knows about this. And rule number two, avoid all refelective surfaces.

MAN				So what's wrong? Never seen anyone at work or what?

FRIDO				Wow, crazy!

FRIDO II			And rule number 3, as of now we only appear separately.

FRIDO 				Hey. What do we do when my mom comes home?

FRIDO II			She just can't see us together.

GESA				Hello... I'm home already. Did you say something?

FRIDO				No why's that?

GESA				Will you set the table? We're having fish.

FRIDO				Yech fish, I hate fish.

FRIDO II 			I love fish.

FRIDO 				Really?

FRIDO II			Yeah...

GESA				Frido, let's go.

FRIDO				Uh... yeah, yeah...

GESA				Is everything okay, Frido?

FRIDO II			Yes, it tastes fantastic

GESA	Thanks. By the way have you got the results of the German test?

FRIDO II			Yes we did...

GESA				Frido, if it didn't go well then...

FRIDO II			I got all the questions right.

GESA	Really? Hey Frido, wow! I must admit I was a bit worried. So all that studying paid off!

FRIDO II	Yes, it was so easy there was no need to study. I was done in five minutes.

GESA				Really. Can you show me the test?

FRIDO II			Sure.

GESA	Does it have to turn into a paper airplane? I have to say Klawitter could have at least made some coment. She's never slow to be critical. Hey Frido! Hey! We need to celebrate this! What would you like for dessert? Mh?

FRIDO II			Uhm, dessert before bedtime?

GESA	Yes of course before bedtime. Whatever you feel like. What do you like the most? Rice pudding? Chocolate pudding? Hm? I know. Berry ice cream.

FRIDO II			No.

GESA				Hello? Frido.

FRIDO II			Uhm. Crepes with Creme brulaye?!

GESA				Crepes with Creme brulaye?!

GESA (sings)	Crepes with Creme brulaye... Crepes with Creme brulaye... Crepes with Creme brulaye... Coming right up, coming right up... Crepes with Creme brulaye... Crepes with Creme brulaye...

FRIDO 	Wow that was amazing! My mother was blown away. And she didn't notice a thing. Wow, crazy! You cleaned up everything! How long can you stick around?

FRIDO II			As long as you need me.

FRIDO 				Wow.

KLAWITTER			Good Morning everyone!

CLASS				Good Morning Mrs Klawitter!

KLAWITTER			What time is it? – Fridolin?

EMIL				Nine. It's nine o'clock.

KLAWITTER?	Emil. Last warning. I will seperate you both. You're not helping Fridolin one bit.

FRIDO II 			It wasn't any help.

KLAWITTER?			What? How? Uh?... What? 

FRIDO II 			Emil's answer is incorrect, Mrs Klawitter.

KLAWITTER 			Oh no?

FRIDO II			Yes.

KLAWITTER?			So it is nine? Yes Nine is correct. However in a full sentence...

FRIDO II 			No, nine is wrong! 

JULI?				Wrong, nine is right!

FRIDO II?			No, nine is wrong! 

KLAWITTER 	No. Quiet now! Fridolin!... If you don't know the answer..., then just admit it!

FRIDO II 	I beg your pardon, I know the answers to all questions, Miss. Klawitter. – It's two minutes past nine.

KLAWITTER 	(Laugh) Well done, Fridolin. Well done! (Laugh). Yes, Fridolin is right: It is two minutes past nine o’clock. Although we'll actually only learn that next year?! Hm...

EMIL				Hey Good studying!

FRIDO II			I already knew that.

EMIL				Yeah sure.

KLAWITTER			And what time is it now? Fridolin?

EMIL				(Blow nose)

SEBI				Hey Dunja, what grows underground and has rythym?

DUNJA				No idea.

SEBI	A beatroot! (Laugh) Frido was pretty cool today. Where is he by the way?

DUNJA	He's left already without saying goodbye. Hey was acting weird all day...

SEBI				Yeah right! He was being such a mega-nerd!

SEBI				Hey Frido!

FRIDO				Hey, there you are!

SEBI?				Why didn't you wait for us??

FRIDO?			I wanted to finish building the racers.

DUNJA?			What's going on with you?

FRIDO 				Why's that? What do you mean? Come on I'll show you.

SEBI?	Please choose me, Mrs Klawitter, I know it Mrs Klawitter... You're acting like a mega-nerd all of a sudden.

DUNJA?			No it's more like a mega-mega-nerd!

FRIDO?	(Laugh) The thing is if I can maybe make a good impression on Klawitter... and... and then I can see less of my tutor. And have more time to see you guys. On your marks...

SEBI				Get set...

DUNJA				Go! 

SEBI				Come on! Faster! Yeah!

ALL				(Yell, Laugh, Follow Pic)

FRIDO 	Yeah, you were totally right. It's all a question of technique. And... that's what that slimebag's going to teach me. And after the tutor I keep studying at home. Often untill late at night.

EMIL				I'm sorry you have so much work because of me.

FRIDO				It's ok. Hey hang on check this out. (Sounds, Laugh)

EMIL				(Laugh) Attack of the killer Klawitter zombies - Attack!

FRIDO				Hey

EMIL				Talk tomorrow

FRIDO				Yeah talk tomorrow

KLAWITTER	"... then the goat...will be eaten...by the wolf...What should I do?"  Then a little later he thought... Take the goat first, then the cabbage. (Laugh) It's all correct!

GESA				This's all correct! (Kiss)

FRIDO				Yeeeeah! One more, one more, one more. Yes! Ah!

KLAWITTER			What is the capital of Latvia? Fridolin?

FRIDO				Riga.

KLAWITTER			Correct. And the capital of Lithuania? Fridolin?

FRIDO				Hey take that! And that.

JARO				Hey loser. Payday.

FRIDO				I've got nothing.

BOCKI				Well if you've got nothing show us.

FRIDO				I've just got cans.

JARO				Just some cans? Empty your pockets.

BOCKI				Yeah right! Come on do it!

JARO				Let's go!

FRIDO				Hi Frido!

JARO				Hey, how's there two of them? Where's he gone?

BOCKI				Yeah right?

GESA				Oh! "I'm at Daddy's". (Smile)

MICHAEL	So what do you say now? It looks great doesn't it? Come here... Sir Frido. Hm ? Wait this isn't right, Hang on don't move! So what do you say now? That's super. It's perfect.

FRIDO				I have to pee...

MICHAEL			Wow, Hey, turn it off before you pull!

MAN				(Breath/Grunt)

MICHAEL			Are you okay?

FRIDO				And Action! What's a knight in a zombie village?

DUNJA				Canned food

FRIDO				Help, Ahhh

FRIDO?			Want to watch it too? Hey, take a look!

HANDY				Canned food!

FRIDO II 			There's no such thing as zombies.

FRIDO?			So what? It's still funny?

FRIDO II?	Could you please be quiet? I'm busy studying Chinese economics

FRIDO	Oh! Who is the Chinese Minister of Agriculture? So? - Come on you know it. Cow-Dung! You really don't know that one! And the Chinese Minister of Defense...

GESA?				Frido! Now it's really time to sleep!

FRIDO II 			I want to check out the Wilhelm School.?

GESA?				You mean that seriously elite school?

FRIDO II 			Yes naturally.

GESA?				Hm, oh well, if you keep this up, then you'll be as good as Emil.

FRIDO II?			I'd like to go to sleep now.

GESA 				Good night my dear.

FRIDO II			Good night my mom.

FRIDO? 			Would you mind not saying "Mom" to my mom?

FRIDO II?			You know that, your mom is also my mother.

FRIDO 				Uh-ha. Hm...

FRIDO II 			Wake up!

FRIDO 				AAH!?What is it?

FRIDO II?			Who's the Chinese Minister of Defence?

FRIDO 				Ca-No-Ning. But...

FRIDO II 	That's wrong. The answer is: Chang Wanquan. Agriculture: Han Yang Bing. Education: Yuan Guiren. Science and Technology: Wan Gang State Security... 

FRIDO 				Did you just learn all that by heart?

FRIDO II?	Yeah. Emil's got no chance. He's as clueless about politics and economics as you are.

FRIDO 				And you're clueless about fun.

KLAWITTER			Ten more minutes!?

FRIDO II			Finished!

EMIL				But this is really stupid, just stay here! Frido!

FRIDO II	I'm sorry, I'm closer to the action at the front and I can concentrate better.

SEBI				Frido drank his smart-ass juice today.

DUNJA	Frido, that's not helping! If you keep that up Sebi will be the worst in the class!

SEBI				Shut your mouth! He's the reason I have to get tutoring.

FRIDO				Oh crap!

FRIDO?			How could you just change seats?

FRIDO II?	I have to concentrate on school! They're handing out half year report cards soon.

FRIDO 				Yeah but you don't gotta scare my friends off!

FRIDO II 			It's have to scare...

FRIDO 				What?!

FRIDO II?	It should be: "You don't have to scare my friends off." If you gotta say gotta you gotta nothing to say.

FRIDO 	Man! Oh crap! I didn't mean to do that! Are you okay? I mean... Is your head okay? Are you unconscious?

FRIDO II 	No. You wished for me to be this way, you know? I'm just... different than you.

EMILS MOTHER?	It doesn't matter what the others think of you. You know what our motto is.  To achieve...(With Emil) what is possible...

EMIL 				What is possible... we have to attempt the impossible.!

EMILS MOTHER?		Exactly! What's with the car now?

EMIL 	Heee! Hmmm... mmmmmm! Are you crazy?! You could have given me a heart attack!

FRIDO?			I have to talk to you please!

EMIL?				Tough luck, I don't want to talk to you!

FRIDO?			Emil please! You're my best friend ever! 

EMIL?				Best friends don't treat each other like crap.?

FRIDO?			Emil, I'm really sorry! But it wasn't me....

FRIDO?			And now tell me, what do you see...

EMIL 				I see... I see...Wow that is totally crazy!!!

FRIDO				Pssst...!

EMIL 			Since when do you have a twin?!

FRIDO?		That's not my twin buddy! That is my reflection! That's me but perfect!

EMIL?			Yeh but... That's not possible!

FRIDO 			Yes it is!

EMIL 			This is so... Crazy.

FRIDO 			I know.

EMIL II			(OFF) It's either one or the other.

EMIL			And he goes to school for you? Every day?

FRIDO?		Yes! That's what I meant! It wasn't me there who...

EMIL 			And everyone thinks you've turned into this total nerd...

FRIDO?		Yeh! He can do everything that I can't!

EMIL?		He can do everything you can't?!  (Nose breath) Where did you find him?

EMIL?			What's so perfect about him?

FRIDO?		Well, you have to press the button first.

EMIL 			Um...What button    ?

EMIL			Ok...

FRIDO 			Uh don't press it!?

EMIL?			And why not? Why do you get to and I don't?

FRIDO?		'Cause things get complicate.

EMIL 		Ah, complicated! Brief analysis of the overall situation! It would not have been complicated if you hadn't lied to your best friend.

FRIDO?		I wasn't allowed to tell and in anycase... you're already smart.

EMIL?			Yeh smart alright. But not perfect! Come on, come on out perfect Emil

EMIL II			Hey you losers?

WALLA			(41: 29:01) Sebi! Otto! Hey over here! Pass. Get it. 

DUNJA			(41:31:08) Great, Emil!

WALLA		(41:40:19) Over here! (41:56:05) Yeah! Nice one Emil! (41:59:12) Wow!

EMIL II 		Get used to it. Emil's done being a loser. This's Emi the bomb now! 

OTTO 			Have you been taking drugs or something? 

JULI			Or had an operation?

DUNJA 		And even without your glasses, Emil, that's cool!

SEBI			Hey Emil, what's a four-eyes without his glasses? A blind man!

EMIL II 		Sebi, Sebi what a bloke, no one's laughing at his joke. 

BOLLHAFF 		Hell Emil, are you crazy? Klawitter's going to hear about this. You alright? 

FRIDO 			Man, Emil! That was a crappy idea! He's going to cause trouble!

EMIL 			Yeah? Okay I'll talk to him.

FRIDO			Yeah, really. 

FRIDO 			I had to tell Emil!

FRIDO II		Hello?

FRIDO 			Are you very mad?

FRIDO II?		You broke the rule.

FRIDO 			Yeah, but I can't let Emil think I don't like him. He's still my best friend. 

FRIDO II?		It would be really too bad if we were caught. Now that it's going so weli for you.

FRIDO?		Yeah but don't worry. Emil's going to talk to him.

FRIDO II		Thank you.

EMIL?		... so it would be super really nice of you, if you could be more cooperative when you're at school maybe?

EMILS MOTHER 	Emil-Leopold - Violiiiin!!

EMIL?		Uhm... Maybe you could... uh, because... I have to practice violin from 2 till 3. Otherwise they'll figure out that you're not me...but you .

EMIL II			Then we'll practice.

EMILS MOTHER 	Emil-Leopold?

EMIL II 		That things lame anyway, sorry.? 

EMILS MOTHER	Have you lost your mind?! We'll talk about this later – What are you doing anyway? We don't waste our precious time with mindless nonsense, turn that off! Kill it now. Turn it off! Emil-Leopold! And get changed for ergotherapy. Emil-Leopold!

EMIL II?		Crap! Chill out woman!

EMILS MOTHER 	What? Emil-Leop...! 

EMIL II?		Crap with the Leopold yourself. I'm Emil! Forget Leopold! Got it?

EMILS MOTHER 	Yes...

EMIL II			Shoo.

EMILS MOTHER 	Fine, I,  I, - I'll pick you up for ergotherapy...

EMIL II			Shoo...

EMILS MOTHER 	Puberty's arrived.. huh...

EMIL II			That's how it's done you wuss.

EMIL 			Hey, wh... where are you going? 

EMIL II 		None of your business!

EMIL 			Mother! Mother!

EMILS MOTHER 	Emil-Leopold... uhm Emil?

EMIL			Here I am... Do you think you could give me a hand with my jacket?

EMILS MOTHER	(Reaction) How did you get up there?

SEBI		What the hell? Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Help!!! Ahh! Let me go! 

JARO?			Hey what have you got on you? 

SEBI			Nothing!

JARO			Hey if you've got nothing then prove it! Little shit! 

DUNJA 		I'm going to tell Seibert!

JARO?			If you tell Seibert then I'll cut off all your hair!

DUNJA			I don't care, do it!

JARO			I think you should care.

EMIL II?		Hello? Excuse me? Have you losers nothing better to do than beat up little kids?

JARO?			Hey spaz. Pay up or should we teach you a lesson too? 

BOCKI			Yeah right

EMIL II			Oh, no – then I guess I'll just pay. Is this enough?

JARO			What's he doing!

SEBI 			Hey Emil

DUNJA			That was so cool!

EMIL II 		When you've done with the tutor come and see me.

OTTO			That was amazing Emil!

JULI			Stunning

EMIL II			Thanks for the skateboard. Later, losers.

EMIL			Hi Sebi!

SEBI			Emil?  Crazy. But look it's so obvious! He's not the real Emil!

BOLLHAFF 		Get inside! Move it! Come on!

DUNJA			Sure, Emil has a lookalike? You're crazy Sebi!

BOLLHOFF 		Emil, school is that way.

EMIL II		Yeah then you know which way to go. I've had enough for today. I don't feel very good.

SEBI		I swear that's not the real Emil. And that nerd up there isn't the real Frido.

DUNJA			Who is he then?

KLAWITTER		Good morning!

CLASS			Good morning.

FRIDO II		Good morning Mrs Klawitter!

KLAWITTER		Good morning.

DUNJA			Do you know what I think Sebi: You're just jealous!

SEBI			But it is odd that Frido's the best in every class...

FRIDO II		I can't help it that you're so stupid...

KLAWITTER		Fridolin! We don't say things like that of others. However I must say I've never seen such a turnaround like this before. The word "penis" is not spelled with an "H“.  Otto? Ok report cards. Fridolin? Very good...

FRIDO II		That's all I could do. Given your previous work. I'm actually the best in the class.

EMIL			Yeh sure...

FRIDO			Math: B! German: B! Social Studies: B! So...

EMIL			... good enough for High School!

FRIDO/EMIL		Yes!

SEBI			Now I've got you, I knew it!

FRIDO		Hey super, I can go to High School! You even managed a B for me in German

SEBI			Crap, damned crap!

EMIL			Hey Frido!

FRIDO			Hi Emil!

SEBI'S FATHER		Uh, (Laugh) And to think that your son would one day enter these hallowed halls... Hm?

SEBI			Hey, are you Frido or just a lame excuse with the shitty haircut?

FRIDO			Huh? What shitty haircut?

SEBI		One can tell right away, that he's defintely not the superman who knocked out those two morons.

EMIL		Which morons? Oh yeah those two morons, now I remember it all....Ah...

SEBI			So tell me: How do you do it?

FRIDO			I don't know what you're talking about.

SEBI			...and now?

PHONE RECORDING 	Hey super, I can go to High School! You even managed a B for me in German

EMIL			Nice special effects!

SEBI			Ok whatever, then I'll send it to everyone! You guys are done.

SEBI'S FATHER		Here we go.

DIRECTOR		Dear boys and girls... dear parents! After elementary school is when life gets really serious.  Do you want your child to be part of the winners...? Or part of the losers? Success needs a stratergy. Hard work! Persistence! Dicipline and structure! The art of focusing! This is what we need to give our children!

FRIDO			Emil, we have to let Sebi in on it!

EMIL			Not a chance! We have to get hold of his phone.

FRIDO			But he's our best friend!

EMIL			Correction: He's your friend!

DIRECTOR?		Superiority!?Without it. Uh...without it...without it we will remain stuck in the muck of mediocrity! And now, have fun while on the tour of our fine institution. Thank you!

MALE			Bravo!

FEMALE		(Reaction)

EMIL'S MOTHER?	So we are of the impression that Emil- Leo..., that Emil's anti-allergy has certain side effects... Not so, Klaus-Peter-Hermann? Say something or what?

EMIL'S FATHER	I want good grades too!

EMIL'S MOTHER?	Hey! This is my Carlotti dress!

EMIL'S FATHER	I'm sorry.

SEBI			I want good grades too, tell me now what you did or I'll show our				parents.

EMIL			Now stop this!

SEBI			Then I'm telling our parents.

SEBI’S FATHER 	Tell me, isn't that the same suit you wore to the prom? – Yes that's right you left the school early!!

BOY 3			Stop this crap. Please.

SEBI			Dad, dad I want to show you something!

FRIDO?		Please...Sebi, nobody want's to see that!?

SEBI 		Oh yes! Frido isn't a good student. There are two of him and two Emils! And I can prove it. 

GESA			Frido, Frido, stop this now. Let him go.

SEBI			They each have a lookalike!

SEBI’S FATHER		Can you just leave my son's phone alone? He's going to break it!

SEBI			Noooooooo!  My phone...

EMILS MOTHER 	Ahhh Klaus-Peter-Hermann. Hurry it's brand new! My Calotti dress! My Calotti dress! Do something! Ahhhh my dress! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

EMILS FATHER		Wait you're stuck.

EMILS MOTHER	Oh no I'm naked! My dress! My dress! Oh God my dress!

MICHAEL		(Laugh)
  
SEBI’S FATHER		What about my pants? Just wait! Now it's your turn! 

BOYS			(Reacs)

MICHAEL		Hey Hey Hey

DIRECTOR?		This is an attack! On the education!

EMILS FATHER		(53:23:06) I'm sorry it was an accident. (53:26:00)  It's not my fault. I'll get it clean.  (53:28:17) Um hello? 

SEBI'S FATHER		(53:38:13) Hahahah! (53:44:00) Who did that? (53:46:00) Oh hi.

EMIL			I'm really sorry for that, Sebi! (Follow Pic)

FRIDO			Ahh...I'm telling you that was...Hey, what are you doing?

FRIDO II		A clear mind needs a clean space around. I'm cleaning up.

FRIDO			Are you nuts?

FRIDO II		I'm throwing all this junk out.

GESA		Sure. Order and structure! (Sing) All those laws you can forget them...do dum dum...

FRIDO			Hey, those are my things

FRIDO II		Ok fine. Then keep your kids stuff.

FRIDO			Hey, wait, have you totally lost it?

FRIDO II		You do understand that it's actually me who gets to go to high school;? There's one too many of us.

FRIDO			No worries! Then you can leave!

FRIDO II		Not a good idea. What would mom say if you were your old self again?

FRIDO		You crazy? Nobody needs you! This is my house, not yours! She's my mother!

FRIDO II		(Laugh) My mom doesn't like losers! Why do you think she divorced Dad?

FRIDO			Are you stupid? (Effort)

FRIDO II		On the contrary. You're the one who's stupid!

FRIDO			You said you'd go when I stopped needing you.

FRIDO II		Hmph, and you broke the rule first. I'll see you around.

FRIDO		We have to be careful! He took off, I don't even know where he is now. Emil! They're dangerous. They want to steal our lives! 

EMIL			What?

FRIDO			Emil!? You have to get rid of Kungfu-Emil!

EMIL 		Why's that? - Things are going pretty well for me right now. Dunja's here with me. She's starting to like me! 

FRIDO 			What? Dunja is with you? 

EMIL		Yeah, well, she's with him, so basically with me, we're just learning math.

FRIDO?		Emil, don't be stupid. She likes the cool Emil not you! 

EMIL		What? Who is stupid here? How would you get through school without your nerd friend You're stupid!  Not me!

FRIDO			Oh bloody hell!

DUNJA		Hey Emil you won't believe it. These fractions here..You'll have to explain them again.

EMIL II			Hey, relax! It's chill time now!

DUNJA 		Seriously? What's going on here?

EMIL		Brief analysis of the overall situation: I believe I have some explaining to do...

EMIL II			Man is he dumb.

DUNJA		Do you have a lookalike? I think I want one too! One who can do math...

FRIDO II		(Reverb) See you around...

GESA 			What are you doing?

FRIDO?		I just wanted to review this!	

GESA			It's five in the morning!

FRIDO?		I want to be able to do it!

GESA?		Tell me, Frido... are you working so hard at school because I put pressure on you? I mean, if it's too much for you... then...

FRIDO?		No. No. I want to do it! - For my future.

GESA			Yes. And it would be nice if you and Emil can stay in the same class?

FRIDO?		Moms - I have to tell you something. The Frido you've seen lately - uhm, that was someone else!

GESA?			Yes. But he wasn't all bad? I'll make some coffee!

ALL			Good morning, Mrs Klawitter.

KLAWITTER 		Good morning. Take your seats.

FRIDO			I'm sorry. I sort of lost track of time this morning.

KLAWITTER 		Aha. Uh. Good, then, who would like to try the first problem? Uh.. This is mathmatics, okay?! Dunja?

DUNJA 		1250 plus 120 is 1370.

KLAWITTER?		1370. That is correct, Dunja. So. 2560 plus 450? Otto?

OTTO?			Mrs Klawitter, it's 3010.

KLAWITTER 		3010. That is correct, Otto. 3010. So, and now the next one...Fridolin –no need to hold back just because the others are trying hard too. Now then... 188 plus 371?

FRIDO 			Uhmm...

KLAWITTER?		So, what's the method? Fridolin! In your head, Fridolin. In your head. The method! 

FRIDO 			539?

KLAWITTER?		What is it you find so funny, Sebastian? It's not as if you're the brightest in the class at math...

SEBI II?		Actually I am extremely bright in math, Mrs Klawitter. Round up 188 to 200 then subtract the 12 from 371,that makes 359, add 200 and that equals 559.

KLAWITTER 		Great! That is...

SEBI II?		Correct. I know. Next problem: 364 plus 479...Is 843.?

OTTO II & SEBI II 	848,000 minus 4500 is...843,500!?568,000 plus...3,300 is 571,300! 558,500 minus 64,598 is 493,902.  645,004 plus 25,870 is 670,874!
_________________________________________________________________________

EMIL?			And the flag is hoisted! On to a new life without rules!

ALL			(Cheers)

EMIL		Hey you guys put the sleeping bags over there. And put the firewood right in the middle. And make sure the newspapers don't get...Get wet....

SEBI?		You don't need to be glaring at Emil like that, you could have said something as well. Traitor!

JULI?		Yeah really! Do you know how much our parents have been on our backs ever since you turned into a nerd?

OTTO?			You wanted to be mister cool...

CLASSMATE II 		Yeh so unfair!

EMIL 			Frido, I just wanted...

FRIDO?		Yeh what? First you didn't want to tell Sebi. And now you have a whole class full of superkids?!  So's everyone thinks you're real cool or what?! Do you know yours wasn't even at school?

EMIL 			I couldn't care less! Then he'll get in trouble!

FRIDO 			You are such an idiot!

EMIL?		Phf! For all I care he can keep my life! You, you're just like my parents. You don't care what I want! And of course I'm the idiot, you can copy my work off of? Honestly? You can forget about high school. You won't make it anyway!

FRIDO			Oh yeah? (Effort)

BOY 1			Hey stop it!

BOY 2			Leave him alone

DUNJA?		Are you totally crazy? You can forget it.

EMIL?			You see? They're my friends now! Bet you didn't see that coming?!

FRIDO 		Crap Emil, in three days time they're all going to realize you're just as nerdy as always.

EMIL?		You're just jealous. Because vyou need your lookalike forever! I bet your mother doesn't even want you back! And I don't need you anymore either!

SEBI			Come on let the crybaby go.

KIDS			Yeah get lost! We don't need you either!

DUNJA			Yeah just go!

SEBI			Get lost.

KIDS			Don't show your face here again! Okay? Loser. Get lost!

PUNK			Hey, Watch where you're going, you little shit! Yeah I mean you.
?
FRIDO			(Rections)

FRIDO II		You see? You aren't needed here anymore. The mirror is waiting for you! What is it? First I was your reflection and now you're mine. Hey, wait you can't runaway from yourself. You are me and I am you.

EMIL 			40, 60, 80. Anyone have anymore?

SEBI			Otto hasn't given anything!

OTTO			Yeh, yeh, it's all good. I'm sorry, that's all I've got.


EMIL			Brief analysis of the situation: That's not a lot.

OTTO			But I'm hungry! And I'm cold as well!

CLASS			Finished!

KLAWITTER 		Ahh...

JULI II			These problems are too easy for me, Mrs Klawitter.

SEBI II			For me too!

CLASS		We want harder problems than yesterday's hard problems. Yesterday's hard problems will be too easy tomorrow. And what's easy tomorrow will be redundant the next day

KLAWITTER		Yes, harder problems.

DIALOGUE OFF	Come on don't forget the ISO mat. Got it already. Come on, let's go home. No need to cry, it's just too cold here.

EMIL 			And what if yourv parents don't wwant you back? 

JULI			What do you mean? 

SEBI?		Man he means your parents might just like the mirror-nerd more than they like you.

JULI?			But she's not actually a real kid!

OTTO			Yeah but nobody knows that!

SEBI			Hey, you do have more to eat!

OTTO 		I found another cookie. I mean, she's good at school and she's definetly good at keeping her room tidy and clean. Parents love that stuff.

DUNJA?	Oh crap. Don't listen to them. Of course your parents want you back. And my parents will want me back too.

SEBI 			Yeh and if they don't?

OTTO?		Agreed, Your parents definetly won't want you back! Out of all of us you are without doubt the worst student.

SEBI?			And you're a greedy pig. Your parents are ashamed of you! 

OTTO			What the hell? Say that again! 

SEBI			With pleasure! They're ashamed!

DUNJA 		Stop it! This makes no sense! Give it a rest now damn it!

OTTO			Take that back.

SEBI			No way!

DUNJA		I want to go home now. Bring your own stuff back before the fair is over.

EMIL			Dunja.

DUNJA			I'm sorry.

SEBI			This is all just crap!

GIRL			Hey, wait for me!

FRIDO 			Hey! Why do you have a mirror image?!

JULI II 			Julia-Sophie was no longer needed.

SEBI II			Sebastian went voluntarily.

DUNJA II?		Parents want perfect kids. And I am perfect.

JULI II 			I am perfect. Juli was releived to be able to vanish into the mirror.

SEBI II 			No! I'm perfect! Sebi could hardly wait to become my reflection...

DUNJA II?		No one needs your loser friends anymore. 

JULI II?			Why are you still here? Today's the last day!

FRIDO 			(Reacs) Hello! Anyone here? Emil? Damn it! Where are you guys?

EMIL II?		Get in the mirror! You're not needed here.

EMIL			Leave me alone!

FRIDO			Emil!

EMIL II			No one likes you dork. Get the hell outta here loser!

FRIDO?		No, Emil! - Don't listen to him! No, Emil! Emil!

EMIL II			There's no place for wimps here.

FRIDO?		There's no place for idiots here! You should be in there!

EMIL II 		Let go of me man!

FRIDO		Emil! Emil! Our entire class disappeared into the mirror! Dunja too, you know that? 

EMIL			Dunja?

FRIDO			You have to help me, get her out again! 

EMIL			But I can't get out!

FRIDO		Emil. At the pool the other day... I was just being mean! You're so much cooler than that dunce. He's just full of crap! Emil! You're funny! And smart! And you're my best friend as well. Come back! Please Emil! There is no more perfect friend than you!

EMIL II 		Cheers you losers! 

FRIDO 			Emil! Emil!

EMIL			Frido! Thank you!

EMIL 			Frido, I didn't mean what I said at the pool! That about your mom...

FRIDO?		Just shut up, - We don't have time for this now! We've got to save our class!

EMIL 			Yeah but how?

FRIDO 		Brief analysis of the overall situation: You got out of the mirror because you believed in yourself.  And that applies to our friends too. We'll show them their super-selves aren't super at all. It's obvious.

EMIL?			Yeah but those super-nerds can do everything! 

FRIDO?		Emil, then think of something!

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	No I won't get a cold...Mother!!!...I'm not aggressive...

FRIDO 			Wait slowly now!

PUPPET?		What are you doing? Huh? Oh, did I scare you? (Laugh) No harm in a little fun...If you like some fun, then you're in luck! If you like fun you can return! Hm.

MIRROR MAZE OWNER 	I'm not upset I just want you to take me seriously!

FRIDO?		"If you like fun you can return"! 

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	(Off) If I'm not myself, who should I be then, Mother?

FRIDO 			I know something those nerds can't do!

EMIL			What?

FRIDO			Come on we'll need Klawitter.

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	(Off) I'm not upset! I'm totally calm! (On) I'm not upset!

EMIL			Ok...? 

FRIDO			Got it?

SEBI’S FATHER 		(Off phone) I'm telling you my son is gifted.

KLAWITTER		No Mister Schmidt!

SEBI’S FATHER 	(Off phone)  Yes, Mrs Klawitter!

KLAWITTER		No Mister Schmidt!

SEBI’S FATHER		(Off phone) Yes!

KLAWITTER		No!

SEBI’S FATHER		(Off phone) Yes, yes, yes, Mrs Klawitter, yes!

KLAWITTER		Sebastian isn't the only one, the…

SEBI’S FATHER 	(Off phone)  Garbage! You have a whole class of gifted kids?!

KLAWITTER		Well I simply can't explain it.

SEBI’S FATHER 	(Off phone)  Shall I explain it to you?!

KLAWITTER		The whole fourth grade is suddenly....

SEBI’S FATHER 	(Off phone)  Well put yourself in my posistion!

KLAWITTER		But of course I understand your posistion.

SEBI’S FATHER 	(Off phone)  Oh yeah?! Then stop underrating Sebastian's achievements!

KLAWITTER		But I'm not underrating him! It's just that…

SEBI’S FATHER 	(Off phone)  I demand that a parents evening on the subject of gifted education takes place immediately!

KLAWITTER		Yes, Mr Schmidt, there will be a parents evening to do so. Good night, Mr. Schmidt.

SEBI’S FATHER		(Off phone) Good night? You think I can sleep now?

KLAWITTER 		So it goes throughout the day. Students are constantly at my door and asking for more homework. More homework! On the weekend! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... be quiet! Better. .Alright. Now to Fridolin.

MICHAEL		Yes Fridolin, well...
 
GESA?			Yes well, uhm.

MICHAEL		We're really...

GESA/MICHAEL	...very worried about Frido

MICHAEL		I believe that's the door.

KLAWITTER		The next ones. Emil!

EMIL			We have to show you something Mrs Klawitter.

KLAWITTER		Fridolin.

GESA 			Frido! Huh?

EMIL 			Frido, don't back out now Frido. Your mother likes you. I know that

GESA			What are you doing here?

KLAWITTER		What is this?

EMIL 			Mrs Klawitter, perhaps you should sit down?

KLAWITTER		Huh? Why's that?

FRIDO			Now all of class 4A is in the mirror and can't get out.

GESA		Okay, did I understand this correctly? The boy who is so very perfect, that's your reflection? Yes? Oh my God! That means that everything was... but you're still our completely normal Frido? Yes? Oh my God! Am I glad that you're you!

FRIDO			Yes, but I might not make it into high school.

GESA		But that's totally fine! Frido! I just wanyed you to have good prospects so's you don't end up like your... But, but not at any price. Really!

MICHAEL 		Even your mother understood that something was wrong with that model boy. Right, Gesa?

GESA		Hey Frido, listen to me! I don't care how you do in school as long as you're our Frido. Understand?

FRIDO			Yeah...

MICHAEL		Understand?

FRIDO			Yeah...

KLAWITTER		Let me get this straight. You're saying there's a whole bunch of those ...monsters lurking around out there?

EMIL			But we have a great plan Mrs Klawitter! And that's where you come in!

KLAWITTER		Oh... oh,God

KLAWITTER?	Tell your parents that your education at the élite boarding school will be financed through a scholarship. – However, there is only one single place. They'll only take the best student...

GESA?		"Aptitude test for admission to an elite boarding school?" "Elite boarding school". That would be something, of course. But if you don't succeed Frido, it's not a problem either.

FRIDO II		There's nothing I can't succeed at!

GESA 		I'm just saying. The other students in your class have become pretty good too. Don't take on too much...


EMIL 			And what if they don't buy it?

FRIDO?		You'll see they'll be much too busy trying to outdo each other – They're coming!

KLAWITTER 		Good morning.

CLASS			Good morning Mrs. Klawitter!

KLAWITTER		Sit down. Well... These are the exam questions from the elite Commission. The test is done as a process of elimination. That is, I ask each of you a question. If you answer incorrectly, you're eliminated, if you answer correctly, you move to the next round. The last student left is the winner. Hm? You have forty seconds to answer each question. - So, did anyone not understand something?

ALL			No Mrs Klawitter!

KLAWITTER?		Well then, let's get serious. Oh, oh, oh, oh Otto. How many peas go in a pot? The clock is ticking.

OTTO II?		OK, no problem. If the exact measurements are missing, the variables must be included in the response. We need to create a formula that is applicable to all possible peas and pots. First: Calculate the volume of a pot. A pot is a cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = G to the power of pi times R = 2 times H.

KLAWITTER 		Yes, you have six more seconds.

OTTO II 		Second, Calculate the volume of a single pea. A pea is a sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere... the question is too complex to answer in only 40 seconds.

KLAWITTER?		Oh is it? – Maybe your approach was wrong??Hm?
	
OTTO II		My approach is never wrong...

KLAWITTER?		Oh no? The correct answer is: Not one.

CLASS			Huh? What? That's not possible...

KLAWITTER		Peas can't go anywhere.

OTTO II		That doesn't make any sense.

KLAWITTER?		It was a question of creative thinking. So. Otto – you don't belong in the elite. Sit down.

OTTO II		But I...

JULI II 			But nothing... You're out!

KLAWITTER		Juli! What gives the sausage it's snap? Clock's ticking!

JULI II 		A question from the food sector. The solution lies in the composition of the ingredients. No, wait ... it's about physics. It's about surface tension. The wrong approach? - The wrong approach. Then maybe it's an intrapersonal perceptual phenomenon. The sausage just seems to have a snap, because ... because ... um ...

KLAWITTER?		You have eight more seconds, plenty of time.?

JULI II 			Because, um ... um How can I not know something?

DUNJA II?		What would the answer have been?

KLAWITTER 		The correct answer to the question "What gives the sausage it's snap?“...is your teeth.

ALL 			Your teeth?

KLAWITTER 		This's actually all a bit disappointing. I expected so much more from you! You lack the ability to think outside the box. I mean, if you really want to make a career, then you have to be able to do more than mindless memorization.

FRIDO 			Now! Good morning.

EMIL			Good morning.

CLASS			(Reaction) The mirror!

KLAWITTER 		But there are children who have this ability. So, Sebastian? 27100 chimneys plus 5 chimneys plus 7 chimneys minus 129 chimneys. - What do you get?

SEBI II 			26983 chimneys?

SEBI 			Wrong, You get smoke out of it you mega mega nerd!

SEBI II			Uhhhh (Reacs) Help!

FRIDO 			It worked, it worked! It's him.

KLAWITTER 		Yes!

OTTO II + JULI II	No, Help! Ahhh! Help!
  
KLAWITTER?		(Reacs) What is yellow and lies on the street? Petra!

DUNJA, JULI, OTTO 	A dead french fry.

KLAWITTER?		Correct! What is white and crawls up the mountain?

ALL?			A homesick avalanche.

KLAWITTER?		Correct!  What fish has a bad temper?

ALL 			A snapper.

KLAWITTER?		Correct! What's leafy green and flies in space?

ALL?			Rocket lettuce!

KLAWITTER 		What bird sits behind bars?

ALL 			A jailbird.

KLAWITTER?		What's the most super work?

ALL?			Homework. Because it's superfluous!

KLAWITTER 		Correct! What do you hear when you listen to a seashell?

ALL			The sound of waves!

KLAWITTER?		Yes! The sound of waves...And what do you hear when you listen to a kebab?

ALL 			The silence of the lambs!

DUNJA II		Nooooooooo!

FRIDO?		You're not needed here either.

FRIDO II?		Do you really think your mother wants you back?

FRIDO			I don't think so. – I know so.

FRIDO II?		Even so... You're a loser! You won't make high school anyway...

FRIDO?		I don't want to go to high school anyway!

KLAWITTER?		There are more important things...than school.

OTTO			Exactly! Do you get it? We want Frido!

SEBI?			The only nerd we want around here is Emil!

EMIL/DUNJA?		We want Frido! We want Frido!

CLASS?		We want Frido! We want Frido! We want Frido!

FRIDO II 		You'll regret this. I am the perfect Frido!

FRIDO 			Perfect? Perfect doesn't exist!

FRIDO II		Ahhhhh

KLAWITTER?		Yes! 

EMIL 			That was crazy!

FRIDO?		Klawitter Critter was the bomb!!

KLAWITTER 		And don't you dare put another lookalike in my fourth grade class again!

CLASS			No, no of course not Mrs Klawitter.

KLAWITTER 		Ready?

ALL			Yes! And one, and two, and...three

MIRROR MAZE OWNER	Ahhh.  What bad luck!

PUPPET		Yes, and it will never end... Why don't I find myself a perfect you?
