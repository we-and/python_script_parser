(The Doorman)





ALI	Boo! Look what I found.


NIRA	Candy! 

AMBASSADOR	Gunnery Sergeant Gorski. 

ALI	Yes, ma’am.

AMBASSADOR	I’m confident my daughter will appreciate some female company.

ALI	Yes, ma’am.

AMBASSADOR	Shall we proceed, Mr. Laughlin?

ALI	Come on, Nira. Let’s get comfy.

LAUGHLIN	(via walkie) Secure VIP’s daughter in Eagle 3. 

SOLDIER	(into walkie) Copy that, Chief.

AMBASSADOR	Mr. Collins, let’s go over the presentation.

NIRA	This is so pretty.

LAUGHLIN	(via walkie) All teams, this is 6. Radio check. Over.

EAGLE 1	(via walkie) Eagle 1. Roger, out.

EAGLE 2	(via walkie) Eagle 2. Roger, out.

EAGLE 3	(via walkie) Eagle 3. Roger, out.

EAGLE 4	(via walkie) Eagle 4. Roger, out.

LAUGHLIN	(via walkie) Eagle 9, this is Eagle 6. Radio check.

CAB DRIVER	(speaking Romanian)

NIRA	How come there’s so many cars with us today?

ALI	To make sure you and your mommy are super safe.

NIRA	Okay. Can I have another piece of candy?

ALI	You’re gonna get me in trouble.

NIRA	Yes!

ALI	All right, just one.

NIRA	Thank you.

ALI	(into walkie) We may have a situation.   (via walkie) Movement in woods 3 o’clock.

LAUGHLIN	(via radio) Yeah, that’s an all clear.

CARLTON	Holy shit!

LAUGHLIN	(via radio) Johnson. Take the lead. Go. Go. Go. Go.

NIRA	Ali?

ALI	Nothing is gonna happen to you, okay? Nothing is gonna happen to you.

AMBASSADOR	Is-- Is Nira alright?

LAUGHLIN	Back it up! Back it up! Back it up!

ALI	All right, sweetie? Sweetie? I need you to sit here and stay low, okay?  Come on, let’s go!!

NIRA	Mommy!

AMBASSADO	It’s okay!

PAT	So when’d you get back?

ALI	To New York? About a week.

PAT	have a place to stay? What about a job?

ALI	Hmm. There wasn’t exactly a parade welcoming me home.

PAT	Well, missed you at the funeral.

ALI	They wouldn’t let me go.

PAT	Not for your sister?

ALI	Non sibi sed patriae. Not Self, but Country - and all that.

PAT	That’s Navy, not us.

ALI	Seemed to make sense at the time.

PAT	You know, the kids would benefit from having their aunt around. Any interest in seeing them? Jon? Okay then. There’s an opening at the apartment building where I’m working. It’s not much but it’s something. They’re doing major renovations. You get the job, hardly anyone’ll be there. Not quite as exciting as where you’ve been. You know when we fought in Vietnam, we a lot saw things... After the war, the only people who really understood what we went through were the other soldiers. There’ groups you could talk to…

ALI	Don’t worry. I’m fine. I’ll check out this job. Missed ya, Uncle Pat.

CAB DRIVER	(speaking Romanian)

ALI	I owe you a couple of Mets tickets.

PAT	Not until they got a team worth watching.

ALI	Hey, uh, so where do I find Borz Blasevic?


PAT	In the locker room. Take the service elevator down to the basement. Go left through the fire doors. You’ll see it. Yeah. And don’t tell him we’re related. He’ll go easier on you.

ALI	All right. Hey, Uncle Pat. Thanks.

BORZ	Hi.

ALI	Hi.

BORZ	You’re Gorski?

ALI	Yes, sir. 

BORZ	Pat told me you were coming. He’s a nice guy. Don’t you think?

ALI	Yes, sir. 

BORZ	You can put your stuff here. Sorry about this, we’re all unisex here. This is what I love about Rachmaninoff. He’s so unexpected. 

ALI	I feel the same way about Dylan.

BORZ	Thomas?

ALI	Bob.

BORZ	You’re not a fan of classical work, are you?

ALI	Not exactly, sir.

BORZ	You can cut the “sir” crap. We’ve got enough kissing up to do here already. We don’t have to do it to each other. We’ll use the next two days to get you acclimated. You get the Easter weekend off. Everyone’ll be out of the building so you won’t miss much. When you come back to work on Monday it’ll be more baby-sitting the Carrington while it gets a face lift. Think you can handle that?

ALI	I’ll do my best, sir.

BORZ	Good.

BOY	Let’s go! Let’s go!

GIRL	Oliver!

FATHER	Hey! I may be old fashioned but a woman doorman?!

BORZ	We’re trying to modernize our image at the Carrington, Sir. I’m sorry.

ALI	Here. Let me help you with those.

MRS. HERSCH	Oh no, I got ‘em.

ALI	I insist. I insist.
 
MRS. HERSCH	Oh.

ALI	Thank you. You’re not moving during the remodeling?

MRS. HERSCH	Borz was -- kind enough to arrange an exception for us. Poor Bernard had a stroke seven years ago. You know how old fogies feel about change.
ALI	Old fogies, come on. You’re not that old.

MRS. HERSCH	Ha! You’re kind. A liar - but kind nevertheless. Oh, that was very helpful, dear. You know, your sister never stopped talking about you. Now I know why.

ALI	Wait, how do you know my sister?

MRS. HERSCH	Well, you’re Ali, right? Your sister and family lived in the building. Her husband and kids still do.
ALI	Where is he?

MRS. HERSCH	10C. Lovely family, but tragic what they’ve lived through. Have a happy Easter.

ALI	Why didn’t you tell me?

PAT	Well, I was going to. I thought being close to family might – might be… Nice…

JON	Max! Get the door!

MAX	I’m busy! (O.S.)

JON	Max! I swear to God, I’m going to throw that game out the window!

MAX	What.

ALI	Is your father home, by any chance?

MAX	It’s for you!

JON	Well, who is it? I’m working. Ali.

ALI	What the hell is going on?

JON	You tell me. You’re working here?!

ALI	Yeah. And that has nothing to do with you?

JON	No.

ALI	Damnit, Uncle Pat.

JON	Do you want to come in?

ALI	No. I did not ask for this.

JON	Believe me, I had no idea you were going to end up here…

LILY	Jasper!

JON	No!

LILY	Jasper! Damnit!

JON	Lily, how many times? Words.

LILY	We have to find him!

JON	Look, I’ve got to get this. It’s my publisher in London. We’ve been missing all morning. Can you just-- I won’t be long.

ALI	Do you need help?

LILY	Jasper could be anywhere by now. We need Max. Come on!

ALI	Okay.

LILY	Max!

MAX	Go away. Lily, what the hell!?

LILY	Jasper escape again. We need your help.

MAX	Get out. I don’t have time to look for your stupid cat.

LILY	If you don’t help us I’ll tell dad that you’re smoking marijuana again. Jasper! Jasper, come here!

MAX	There’s 63 apartments on ten floors, all of ’em open for the contractor. This is going to take forever.

LILY	Max collected all the blue prints for the Carrington when he was a boy scout.

ALI	Max a boy scout? I can see that.

LILY	Jasper! Jasper! Jasper! Where are you?

ALI	Where’d your brother go?

LILY	Max? Max, this isn’t funny! Max, where’d you go? Max-- (screams)

MAX	(screams)

LILY	Butt brain!

ALI	Where did you even come from anyway?

MAX	A secret door. The building is full of them. The servants used them to get from room to room.

ALI	Huh.

LILY	JASPER Jasper! What’s your name, anyhow?

ALI	Ali.

LILY	Aunt Ali? Mommy told us all about you.

ALI	She did?

LILY	Yeah. You were her hero.

ALI	So how do we find Jasper anyway?

LILY	Jasper.

MAX	Let’s check the basement.

LILY	That’s Jasper!

ALI	What’s with this wall?

MAX	They were building a subway tunnel under The Carrington. They ran out of money in the 40’s. Sealed it up.

LILY	Jasper! Jasper! Please be okay.

ALI	Max, give me your phone. There he is.

LILY	What do we do?

ALI	Now, let’s see..

LILY	What’s she doing?

ALI	Do NOT try this at home.

LILY	I didn’t think we’d ever see Jasper again, but then Aunt Ali dropped into the hole like Spiderman and saved him!
JON	Really?

ALI	Yep.

JON	Your Aunt was always full of surprises. Right, you, go in and get started on your mommy’s mint sauce and I’ll join you in a minute.

LILY	Will you come to Easter dinner tomorrow? I’m cooking it.

ALI	Lily, I would love that, but...

JON	You’ve got to eat. It’ll give us a chance to... reconnect.

ALI	I don’t want to reconnect.

JON	I’m taking the kids back to the UK on Monday during the construction. You’ll have the place to yourself without us. The only reason we stayed so long was Lily wanted to make an Easter dinner here like her mother did.

ALI	I know... We weren’t really in touch... And then I didn’t know what to say…

LILY	Please, Ali?

BORZ	You’re still here, buddy? Your shift ended over an hour ago. Don’t you have an Easter feast waiting for you somewhere?

PAT	I promised Mrs. Hersch I’d fix her microwave before I went home.

BORZ	That’s thoughtful of you.

PAT	Yeah, well I don’t want to disappoint her.

BORZ	You want to share a beer? Start the celebration?

PAT	Yeah, sure. Hey, hey, tilt the glass! You never poured a beer before?

BORZ	Like this? Is that better?

PAT	Yeah.

BORZ	A better tilt? So what’s your plans tonight?

PAT	Ah, home. TV, bed.

BORZ	No party?

PAT	No party.

BORZ	Okay. Here’s some beer, at least.

PAT	(gasping, moaning, then screaming)

BORZ	You’re back already?

ALI	I am.

BORZ	I told you to take the holiday off.

ALI	The Stantons invited me for dinner.

BORZ	You work fast.

ALI	Sheer force of my personality maybe?

BORZ	You’re staying in?

ALI	Yeah, home cooked meal. Trust me. I would welcome any excuse to duck out, but I promised, so...

BORZ	Okay.

ALI	You want me to save you some pie? It’s fresh from the deli.

BORZ	No, it’s okay. I’m on a diet.

ALI	Your loss.

BORZ	Have fun.

DUBOIS	Shall we begin?

PEE-WEE	(into radio) Jammer’s set. Good to go.

HAMMER	Cut it. Cut it. Cut the blue one. Let me handle it. I got it, I got it, I got it. Please. Thank you.

LEO	Whoa, whoa!

HAMMER	 Woo! Rock and roll!

ALI	What’s this?

LILY	Something I made for you.

ALI	Wait, Lily... This is amazing. How did you draw this? It looks exactly like me.

LILY	I used the picture of you and Daddy.

ALI	Where’d you find this?!

LILY	In Daddy’s memory book. Don’t you like it?

ALI	Yeah. No, I love it. It’s amazing. Thank you so much, I’m going to put it right up here so that everyone can enjoy it.

LILY	Do you think they’ll like it?

ALI	Of course. Speaking of everyone, where is your father?

LILY	He’s busy.

MAX	He’s always busy.

ALI	Your mommy told me a story. Do you know what water wings are?

LILY	Daddy made me wear them when I learned to swim. It’s so frustrating.

ALI	Can you imagine wearing them every single day?

LILY	I wouldn’t cope, I’d die.

ALI	What if I told you that your daddy use to wear them every single time he left the house. 

LILY	You’re kidding.

ALI	It’s true. Your grandma live in a house with a really lake. So every time your daddy wanted to go out and play, she made him them. 

LILY	You’re kidding!

ALI	So every time you get a little mad at your dad, just remember-- water wings.

LILY	Water wings.

ALI	Mm-hmm.

JON	Sorry, I had a deadline. Finally got the publisher off my back. Okay. What are you doing? Help your sister. Uh, did I miss something?

ALI	What? No. Miss something here? Nothing. There’s nothing to miss.

LILY	Nothing at all. Nothing. Just talking about vegetables.

ALI	Just vege-- love vegetables.

LILY	Yeah.

ALI	Yeah.

JON /LILY	All right...

MRS. HERSCH	That must be Pat to fix the microwave. Oh, Borz! Happy Easter!

BORZ	Happy Easter! 

MRS. HERSCH	What can I do for you?

BORZ	You have a visitor.

MRS. HERSCH	I wasn’t expecting one.

BORZ	It’s an old friend of your husband.

MRS. HERSCH	A friend of Bernhard’s?

DUBOIS	Good evening. My name is Victor Dubois. I happened to be in town briefly for the holiday and wanted to stop by. I hope this is not too much of an inconvenience.

MRS. HERSCH	Oh, of course not. Oh, come in, come in... Can I get you anything? Some tea? We have plenty of food.

DUBOIS	Some tea would be delightful.  My old friend. 

MRS. HERSCH	Bernhard hardly says a word since the stroke. The doctors say it triggered “akinetic mutism”. Now, Mr. Dubois, How do you know my husband?
DUBOIS	We worked together in Berlin over thirty years ago.

MRS. HERSCH	(laughing) My Bernhard? Oh no, that’s not possible.

DUBOIS	He went by the name of Erik Dreschler then.

MRS. HERSCH	I’m afraid you have the wrong person.

DUBOIS	I’m afraid not.  (speaking French) Erik, you know why I’m here, right? Make your life easier and tell me. Where are they?

MRS. HERSCH	Mr. Dubois, my husband doesn’t speak French. He’s never even been to Europe.

DUBOIS	Erik. 

MRS. HERSCH	Borz, what is this about?

BORZ	Sit down. Sit down. It seems there’s a lot you don’t know about your husband, Mrs. Hersch.

LILY	I can’t wait until dinner. I’m starving.

JON	So what was it like over there?

ALI	It was, uh… It was great.

MAX	Did you kill anyone?

JON	Max! Don’t be an imbecile. That’s totally out of line.

ALI /MAX	Mmm. No, it’s-- it’s fine. Uh, yeah. Yes, I did.

MAX	Cool.

ALI	More wine?

JON	Yeah. Yeah, of course. I’ll just open another bottle.

LILY	I just wish everything could go back to the way it was before mommy died…

ALI	So, uh… How long do these go in for?

JON	About fifteen minutes. They’ll be fine when you take them out.

DUBOIS	Dreschler. I know everything. (in French) Between 1995 and 2005 you sold four paintings. You made the shipments right here from The Carrington. Where are the rest?

MRS. HERSCH	I told you. We don’t know anything.

BORZ	Would you like some help.

DUBOIS	Not yet. (-in French) Erik. Tell me where the paintings are and I promise I will not harm you and your wife.

BORZ	What about now?

DUBOIS	Refresh his memory.

BORZ	He’s a tough old guy.

MRS. HERSCH	He’s had a stroke! 

BORZ	Sit down! Sit down!

MRS. HERSCH	He can’t feel a thing on that side of his body.

DUBOIS	Try the other side.

MR. HERSCH	(Screaming)

BORZ	That’s better.

MR. HERSCH	Dubois?

DUBOIS	Welcome back, Herr Dreschler. (in French) Where are my paintings?

MR. HERSCH	In the wall.

DUBOIS	Which wall? Point to it.

MR. HERSCH	Here. Oh! No, no, no. Here. I don’t know. Please!

BORZ	(into radio) Gentlemen, you can enter.

MR. HERSCH	I don’t know!

LEO	(via radio) Copy that.

BORZ	So it’s in the walls. Let’s get started. What does this bring to mind? Wagner. 

GONZALEZ	Duvall.

HAMMER	Apocalypse Now..

BORZ	I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

ALI	Nice view.

JON	Yeah. It was a big selling point. 

LILY	The sauce tastes really… The mint sauce…

JON	It’s all right. It’s all right. We’ll make do without. It’s okay.

LILY	That was mommy’s favorite! We can’t have Easter dinner without the mint sauce. That was mommy’s favorite! We can’t. We just can’t.

JON	It’s okay.  Max! Are you stoned?

MAX	You get sloshed. I get stoned. What’s the big deal?

JON	One’s legal. One isn’t. Go to your room.

MAX	Wait, so-- she spills mint sauce on me and I’m the one who’s sent to my room?! If mom was here, she never would have dealt with this shit.

JON	Mom isn’t here. I’m here. And you’re just going to have to get used to that.

MAX	Yeah. Of course mom’s not here! Thanks to you!

JON	Max, go to your room. Now!

MAX	Why couldn’t you have been the one who died. Fuck this shit.

JON	I’m sorry you had to witness that.

ALI	Hey, I’ve seen worse. Lily, the Hersch’s are here and I bet they have loads of spare mint sauce. What do you say, huh?

LILY	But it won’t have pine nuts.

ALI	I bet I can find some of those too.

JON	Hey Ali? Can you just wait a moment? 

ALI	Sure.

JON	Sweetheart, why don’t you get a sponge and towel from the kitchen. I’ll help you clean.

PEE-WEE	Damnit! It’s empty.

BORZ	Where are they!

MRS. HERSCH	We don’t know what you’re looking for! Please! We’ve lived in this apartment for seven years and if there was something here, I would know about it!
DUBOIS	You’ve been living here for seven years?! My records indicate you’ve lived at The Carrington for close to thirty.
MRS. HERSCH	Mm-hmm. We used to live upstairs. When Bernhard had his stroke, we wanted something on the ground floor so we moved down here.
DUBOIS	There you have it. And which apartment did you used to live in?

MRS. HERSCH	10C.

DUBOIS	10C. Thank you, Mrs. Hersch, for your cooperation.

BORZ	10C is occupied.

DUBOIS	Occupied?!

BORZ	They delayed their move until Monday. It’s a professor with two kids--

DUBOIS	You informed me the building would be empty except for the Hersch’s!

BORZ	It’s ten floors up. I didn’t think that --

DUBOIS	That’s right. You didn’t think. Well, do so now. Figure out what to do with them. Let’s go

LEO	Pack it up. I got there

MRS. HERSCH	Even that hoodlum sees you for the vain brute you are.

MR. HERSCH	(Screaming)

BORZ	So now you talk?

JON	I can’t tell you what it means to the kids for you to be here.

ALI	They have a unique way of showing it, don’t they?

JON	Well, you should see them on a bad day. I’m sorry, Ali. I mean I feel blessed with my kids and the time I had with Kate but your sister wasn’t the easiest person.

ALI	Yeah, you married her.

JON	Yeah, you’re right. We went through a rough patch. I turned to you. I was wrong to do so. 

ALI	Just-- can we not?

JON	No. No, I’ve thought about this for years. Just hear me out. You saw me as the man I wanted to be. You made me feel... You made me feel. And then I wake up one morning and you’ve gone. What am I supposed to think?

ALI	I went off to serve my country.

JON	Oh, come on. That’s an absurd rationalization if ever I’ve heard one.

ALI	I understand you were in pain. But I was never gonna be the person to ruin my sister’s marriage. How do you think I felt?

JON	What, so you sign up as a lifer in the Marines? It’s almost a cliché.

ALI	What do you want from me?

JON	Ali, I never meant to hurt you...

ALI	To be honest, I don’t really care anymore.

JON	But I do.

ALI	I am going to get Lily’s mint sauce now. Mrs. Hersch? Mrs. Hersch? (gasping) Oh my god. Oh my god. Borz! (via intercom) Borz! Are you there? 

BORZ	Hello?

ALI	Borz! Call the police! The Hersch’s are dead!

BORZ	(via intercom) Hello I cannot hear you. Come you please come to the lobby. Hello?

ALI	Shit.

LILY	Ali? Ali! Did you get it?

PEE-WEE	Hello, young lady.

LILY	Daddy!

JON	Hey! What’s going on? Hey, who are you!

DUBOIS	Good evening. My name is Victor Dubois. Sorry for the unannounced arrival. I promise our visit will be as brief as humanly possible.

LILY	Who are they?

JON	It’s okay, sweetie. We do what they say and everything will be fine.

LILY	What if it isn’t fine?

JON	Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

ALI	Borz! What’s going on? I just tried to call you.

BORZ	Intercom is not working. The phones are down, I don’t know.

ALI	The Hersch’s are dead! 

BORZ	What?

ALI	Call the police.

BORZ	(Screaming)

ALI	Go, go, come on. Come on.

DUBOIS	No need to hide your phone. You will find there is no service. Quite the collection you have here. A fan of European history, are you?
JON	I teach it at Columbia.

DUBOIS	Oh, you’re a professor? Goya. One of Los Caprichos. Very good taste Mr. Stanton.

JON	Well, you know your art.

DUBOIS	I admire how an artist can dip his brush into his soul and capture his times in paintings.

JON	It appears Goya captured our times as well. The picture’s called, “The sleep of Reason produces monsters.”

BORZ	Hi guys. Hi Jon.

JON	Borz. What is this about?

BORZ /PEE-WEE	It will be fine. Pee-Wee, get over here. There’s a girl trapped in the elevator on the 8th floor..

LILY	He’s talking about Ali.

BORZ	Can you go take care of it?

DUBOIS	Everything okay?

BORZ	Everything’s super. Hi Lily. Happy Easter.

LILY	Hi Borz.

BORZ	Where’s Max?

JON	He’s with his Aunt for Easter in the Hamptons.

DUBOIS	Max? I find it interesting that you set up a place for him here at your table.

BORZ	Go find him.

HAMMER	Hey buddy. (meows at the cat)

BORZ	We’ll get started with the work, Martinez.

MARTINEZ	Copy. Okay, let’s start here, here, and here.

JON	Hey! What are you-- what are you doing?

BORZ	Shut up! Sit down!

PEE-WEE	Hey, sweet thing.  I smell you. Yeah. 

ALI	Who are you and what do you want?

PEE-WEE	Where are you?  You’re a twisted bitch, ain’t you? Oh, you’re not a Virgo, are you? I dated one of those… She always had to choose the movies. It was a disaster. I’m a Gemini. What are you?

ALI	I’m a Scorpio. It would never work. Max.

BORZ	(via radio) Pee-Wee? Pee-Wee?

JON	Please, just stop.

MARTINEZ	Nothing in this wall. 

JON	I don’t know what you want. I’ll give you anything, just leave us alone.

DUBOIS	I appreciate your kind offer, but in this instance I don’t believe you can be of assistance.

BORZ	Pee-Wee, come in.

DUBOIS	What’s going on?

BORZ	Pee-Wee’s not answering. Take Leo and check it out.

DUBOIS	Perhaps it is just a problem with Pee-Wee’s radio.

BORZ	As you taught me, it’s better to cover every scenario. And when you’re down in the lobby, turn the elevators on so we can use them.

DUBOIS	And what scenario am I missing?

BORZ	There is a doorman in the building. It’s just a girl, it’s nothing to worry about.

ALI	Max, what happened?  Sweetie, I’m sorry that you had to see that but I need you to focus. Tell me everything that you know. Max!

MAX	You killed him...

ALI	Listen. The only thing that matters right now is where he came from and how we can stop them.

MAX	A bunch of guys with guns broke into our apartment. They’ve got my dad and sister.

ALI	Okay, how many guys?

MAX	I don’t know four... maybe five? Borz is with them.

ALI	I figured.

MAX	And some French dude. I think he might be their leader... This is so twisted.

ALI	Focus, Max. You know your way around this building. I don’t. I need you. Your family needs you. What would they want in your apartment anyway?

HAMMER	I’m telling ya, this shit is messed up. Did you see cutting that old man’s leg? It’s like he was enjoying that shit. You saw it. I don’t know, man. I don’t know if this job is worth it. Hey, how much you getting paid? 25? What, 30? 

LEO	(via radio) Borz, Come in.

BORZ	(into radio) Yeah, copy.

LEO	(via radio) We found Pee-Wee. He’s dead.

DUBOIS	This is how you have things under control?

BORZ	(into radio) Find her and kill her.

LEO	(via radio) Copy.

ALI	Go, go, go, go, go.

HAMMER	What was that? Go, go.

LEO	I see ‘em, I see ‘em! Get them!

ALI	Max?

MAX	There’s a-- there’s a room behind one of these walls. Pat told me. He called it “a hidden sanctuary”.

MAX	I got it. I got it. 

ALI	Not exactly the sanctuary I was expecting...

HAMMER	(into radio) Borz? Borz, come in.

BORZ	(via radio) Copy.

LEO	I’m going up.

HAMMER	(into radio) We lost them.

BORZ	(into radio) You lost them? Who’s them?

HAMMER	(via radio) She’s got a kid with her. 

BORZ	It's Max.

HAMMER	(via radio) And she’s armed.

BORZ	Keep looking.

ALI	You know Morse?

MAX	I was a scout once.

ALI	So what is this place?

MAX	It’s a speakeasy. During prohibition, the residents would meet here in secret to get wasted.

ALI	Well, not on my watch. Come on, what are you doing?

MAX	You’re not my mom.

ALI	Exactly. Sit down.

DUBOIS	How’d she get into the building? 

BORZ	I let her in.

DUBOIS	Really?

BORZ	Yeah, she was having dinner here with the Stantons and that – 

DUBOIS	That she was on the tenth floor?

BORZ	Yeah.

DUBOIS	You idiot. So, she was having dinner here? What light can you shed on our mysterious lady?

JON	Nothing. I just met her. 

DUBOIS	You invited a stranger to share Easter dinner? She must be very beautiful.

JON	She helped my children save Jasper our cat. She’s new here. It was the least we could do.

DUBOIS	Who is this doorwoman? Do you have a name?

BORZ	Ali.

DUBOIS	Ali what?

BORZ	Her full name… Something Polish... Gorski.

DUBOIS	Oh, incroyable. 

BORZ	What?

DUBOIS	“Gunnery Sergeant Alexandra Gorski of the Marine Security Guard Brigade received the Silver Star for her actions on October 15, 2019 during a terrorist ambush on the Ambassador’s convoy in Bucharest, Romania. Gorski is only the third female soldier to receive the award for exceptional valor since WWII.” What’s a decorated soldier doing here as a doorman?

MAX	Why didn’t you talk to my mom?

ALI	That’s a long story.

MAX	What about my dad? You guys clearly knew each other.

ALI	He was kind of an ass.

MAX	Yeah, still is.

ALI	No, I didn’t mean that. Your dad’s a good man.

MAX	My dad’s a pussy.

ALI	No, he’s not.

MAX	You don’t know anything about him.

ALI	A dad raising two kids on his own is not a coward.

MAX	My mom and dad were driving back from the theater... I was on the phone with my mom when the car slid off the road into the lake. My mom was trapped inside. Dad made it out, she didn’t.

ALI	I’m sure that he tried everything that he could.

MAX	I was on the phone with her for a full minute as the car filled with water. What was he doing all that time? He should have done more.
ALI	Don’t you think he--

MAX	He didn’t fucking try hard enough!

LEO	Did you hear that?

ALI	Hey. Don’t be ashamed. I’ve seen plenty of tough guys cry.

MAX	I’m not my father.

ALI	Max, what the hell? Christ. Give me that! Are you out of your goddamn mind? 

LEO	Let’s go.

ALI	Please tell me there’s another way out of this room.

MAX	Check this out.

ALI	What is it?

MAX	This is how they got the liquor up here without anybody noticing. Come on, it’s our way outta here.

GONZALEZ	Okay, okay. Okay. Well, there’s six more rooms. If we have to tear down every wall, we’re gonna be here 'til Christmas.

BORZ	So what now, Mr. Dubois?

DUBOIS	They’re here. They have to be.

ALI	Okay. Slowly, slowly. 

HAMMER	Watch out man, I got this.

ALI	Go!

DUBOIS	You have amassed quite a library over the years, Mr. Stanton.

JON	The books I’ve collected have been an important part of my work.

DUBOIS	With a distinct bent toward British history.

JON	Oh, you can take the boy out of England but you can’t take England out of the boy.

DUBOIS	You must have spent a small fortune to build shelves capable of storing your collection.

JON	Uh, the former tenants built the library. That was the main reason we bought this place. What the hell are you doing?

DUBOIS	I never knew Dreschler to be a big reader.

JON	Dreschler?

DUBOIS	Your Mr. Hersch.  (in French) Here. Borz, get the tools!

GONZALEZ	A customized Mosler from the early 80’s. Four wheel combination lock… This isn’t going to be easy.

DUBOIS	How long?

GONZALEZ	A good safe cracker would get you inside within five hours. I’ll do it in two.

DUBOIS	Do it in one.

GONZALEZ	No, no, no. We need the water to cool the drill bit, man. Grab the hose, hook it up in the kitchen.

BORZ	So you’re telling me what to do now? Who put you in charge?

DUBOIS	Get him what he needs.

JON	I opened a vintage bottle of wine for the holidays. Would you care to join me for a glass?

DUBOIS	That would be splendid.

JON	Would you like some? I’ll take that as a no. Here we are, Mr. Dubois. Enjoy.

DUBOIS	Hmm. That’s an old Italian. I prefer Bordeaux.

JON	It was a gift. I’m not much of a connoisseur myself. Sweetheart, can you hold this for a second.

ALI	It’s not like your video games, is it? Turn around.

JON	I’ve been wondering how long ago you met Mr. Hersch?

DUBOIS	Why do you ask?

JON	Oh, just habit. Too many years in research libraries. My wife used to say I asked too many questions.

DUBOIS	Over thirty years.

JON	How interesting. A Frenchman and a German. 

BORZ	Is the water running?

MARTINEZ	What’s it look like?

JON	Historically speaking, you haven’t always gotten along?

DUBOIS	We had common business interests.

JON	Oh, and Borz? Where did you meet home? He doesn’t strike me as intelligent enough to move in your circles. Let me guess. Prison.

DUBOIS	You have done a splendid job of deduction, Mr. Stanton. Borz and I did meet in prison.

JON	I don’t think you should give him this kind of information.

DUBOIS	Down, Borz. It is okay.

GONZALEZ	Borz, I need a hand.

BORZ	Coming.

ALI	Damnit.

MAX	They locked us in? The phones are dead.

ALI	Okay, uh-- do you know where the main panel is?

MAX	Yeah, control room. This way.

ALI	Okay, well, we can forget about getting the phone lines to work again.

MAX	What about the fire alarm?

ALI	That’s a good idea. Okay. Yeah, okay. 

GONZALEZ	Boom. One down.

JON	May I ask what you’re looking for? Perhaps I can help.

DUBOIS	What have you learned is my passion?

JON	What, your love for art?

DUBOIS	And how long ago did I meet Mr. Hersch?

JON	Over thirty years.

DUBOIS	In East Germany, to be precise. And you, the learned scholar, can you tell me what were the most prominent events there at that time?

JON	Well, the last days of the German Democratic Republic. The fall of East Berlin. The wall coming down.

DUBOIS	Bravo! Dreschler – I mean, your Mr. Hersch - was in charge of the Koko program, requisitioning the most valuable assets of his East German citizens.
JON	I see. And you were brought in to fence them off to finance a bankrupt government.

DUBOIS	I was saving those works so the rest of the world could enjoy them. If it weren’t for my efforts they could have been lost forever behind an iron curtain.

JON	God, you delude yourself.

DUBOIS	I came to take what is mine, professor. I paid for it with the best years of my life--

BORZ	Hey! What are you doing?! Give me that.

DUBOIS	What?

BORZ	So what do we do now?

DUBOIS	Delete it.

BORZ	You’re coming with me.

JON	No! No, don’t touch my daughter!

LILY	Daddy!

BORZ	Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. 

DUBOIS	Stop! Remember, we are civilized.

BORZ	You talk too much.

DUBOIS	Delete it!

ALI	All right, pull that.

MAX	Got it, let’s go.

DUBOIS	What is that?

BORZ	It’s the fire alarm.

DUBOIS	I know it’s the fire alarm, you idiot! I specifically instructed you to disable it.

BORZ	I’ll handle it.

MAX	Ali?

BORZ	Can you come in here for a second? Drop the guns. Slowly. Step away from the door. Behind the wall. One word from you and I’ll shoot the kid. Understood?

FIRE CHIEF	Come on!

BORZ	I’m coming! Sorry.

FIRE CHIEF	What’s going on here?

BORZ	Hey. Just a false alarm.

FIRE CHIEF	What do you mean it’s a false alarm?

BORZ	Some of the contractors might have crossed the wires. Something, I don’t know.

FIRE CHIEF	Why was the doors locked? 

BORZ	There’s no one else here because of the remodel, except for some construction guys. 

FIRE CHIEF	You can’t lock the door. It’s illegal and it’s dangerous.

BORZ	Yeah, but the entire building is locked down. It’s closed off, so we’re using the service doors.

OFFICER OLSEN	What’d I miss?

BORIS	Hi.

FIRE CHIEF	Well…

BORZ	It’s a false alarm.

FIRE CHIEF	City regulations say we gotta check it floor by floor.

BORZ	Ten floors, go ahead.

FIREMAN	Come on, Captain. Easter dinner’s getting cold at the station.

FIRE CHIEF	Hey, regulations is regulations.

OFFICER OLSEN	C’mon Chief. Give your guys a break. We can bend the rules a little. Clearly there’s nothing wrong here.

BORZ	Absolutely not. False alarm, a hundred percent.

FIRE CHIEF	Alright. You just keep your carpenters away from my fire alarm system.

BORZ	Absolutely, it won’t happen again, sir.

FIRE CHIEF	Let’s go.

OFFICER OLSEN	Hey. Another false alarm and you’ll get fined.

BORZ	Thank you very much, highly appreciate it.

FIRE CHIEF	Okay, party’s over.

BORZ	Thank you! Happy Easter! Nice try, Gorski. You aroused my curiosity now. Why would a decorated officer hole up here as a doorman?

ALI	To meet interesting people - like you.

BORZ	I had a friend that came back after war and he was damaged. Are you damaged Sergeant?

ALI	Not as damaged as you.

BORZ	(laughing) And what about this --

ALI	Get their guns! Take the gun. Max, give me the rifle.

BORZ	Find them!

ALI	Find a way out. You go that way.

BORZ	Kill her!

HAMMER	Come on! Get her!

LEO	There she is! Hey!

BORZ	Find the kid. I’m gonna kill that bitch.

LEO	(whistling)

RADIO PERSONALITY 1	Yeah. The car runs on an app, and the app, it’s stupid.

RADIO PERSONALITY 2	Oh my God!

RADIO PERSONALITY 1	Right, so we’re halfway up a mountain, no one for miles.

MAX	Officer!

OFFICER OLSEN	What is it? You okay?

MAX	There are terrorists in The Carrington. You’ve got to call the police. SWAT. Everybody!

OFFICER OLSEN	Hold on, hold on. Terrorists? In the Carrington?

MAX	My dad. My sister - they’ve been kidnapped.

OFFICER OLSEN	Kidnapped?!  (into radio) This is 105-Charlie. I got a 10-10 here at 85 and Central Park West. There’s a kid here who claims The Carrington has been taken over by terrorists. What’s your name?

MAX	Max Stanton.

OFFICER OLSEN	(into radio) His name is Max Stanton. They want to speak to you.

MAX	(into radio) Hello?

DUBOIS	Hello, Max. We miss you up here.

OFFICER	OLSEN  Let’s go, kid.

MAX	Stay back.

OFFICER OLSEN	Whoa, hold on. Easy. How ‘bout you give me that gun, kid?

MAX	I’ll shoot you, you cocksucker.

OFFICER OLSEN	Yeah? You going to spray my brains all over the car? Good boy.

LEO	How’s it going? Huh?

DUBOIS	Ms. Gorski? Ms. Gorski? Ms. Gorski-- can you hear me?

ALI	Whoever you are and whatever you’re up to, you should walk away. Now. Someone’s bringing the police to bring you down. And if they don’t stop you, I will.

DUBOIS	Things don’t always work out as we might wish. You, of all people should understand that, Sergeant Gorski. Oh, by the way, I have someone here who wants to say hello.

MAX	I’m sorry, Ali.

DUBOIS	The internet is a marvelous invention, n’est ce pas? I was fascinated to read about what happened while you were in the service at the embassy. Unless you want more innocent blood on your hands, be here in fifteen minutes, unarmed and surrender. It’s over.

GONZALEZ	Two!

NIRA	Ali?

ALI	Nothing’s going to happen to you, okay? Nothing’s going to happen.

DUBOIS	Why did you stop?

GONZALEZ	There’s no water. And we need water.

DUBOIS	Check the faucet.

BORZ /LEO	Nothing. Leo?

LEO	Yeah?

BORZ	Check the bathroom.

LEO	No water in the bathroom.

BORZ	It’s that bitch in the basement.

DUBOIS /GONZALEZ	We have no time for this! Keep drilling.

GONZALEZ	Uh, wha-- no. No, no, no. You see, the uh-- the drill bit, it’ll break. We need the water to keep it cooled.

DUBOIS	Keep drilling! That’s an order!

GONZALEZ	Okay. Okay. (yelling in French). I’ve got-- we need-- we need water.

DUBOIS	Merde. He created this mess, you fix it. Go! Turn on the water.

LEO	Yessir.

BORZ	(Via radio) Leo, what’s going on?  (Into radio) What’s taking so long? 

GONZALEZ	You know, we are so close. I mean, I’m on the last lock. Come on.

BORZ	(via Radio) Leo?

ALI	He’s dead. And you’re next.

DUBOIS	It seems your dull, woman friend is more effective than you gave her credit.

BORZ	I hear your put downs. I don’t hear any solutions. What?

DUBOIS	Try this one. From someone like me who appreciates fine art, I can say your daughter has real talent. There is a stunning likeness in her drawing to this photo. If you just met Sergeant Gorski, why there is a photo of you together when you were younger? I noticed your daughter’s signature and her reference to her “Aunt Ali”. I assume you are related to the war hero killing all my men. (in French) Yes?

LILY	Aunt Ali is smarter and stronger than all of you. She saved Jasper.

JON	Lily. Lily, come here.

LILY	Did I say something wrong?

DUBOIS	No. Quite to the contrary. You said something right. Thank you.  (via radio) It appears you have been withholding important information from us. I understand that kind of duplicity can get you discharged from the military. Isn’t that true, “Aunt Ali”.

ALI	(into radio) Let them go or I will –

DUBOIS	(via radio) Listen to me. For every ten --  (into radio) -- minutes that pass without water, a member of your family will lose a limb. Now turn on the water.

ALI	(into radio) Wait. The main water valve has been destroyed. (into radio) But I have a plan.

LILY	Aunt Ali!

DUBOIS	Welcome, Sergeant. I am Victor Dubois. I accept your total surrender.

ALI	Now listen to me, Victor. Once I get the water, you will release my family. And if you don’t, I will take you to hell.

DUBOIS	I’m impressed someone in your position negotiates from an illusion of strength. We have already established our terms. Now, the water.

BORZ	(into radio) Officer OIsen, get up here.

OFFICER OLSEN	Now we wait.

GONZALEZ	Look! We’re back!

DUBOIS	Good.

GONZALEZ	We got water!

ALI	(into radio) I kept my end of the bargain. (via radio) Now it’s yours.

GONZALEZ	We’re in! We are in. We are in. Okay.

DUBOIS	Careful! Very good.

BORZ	Move the box.

GONZALEZ	Yes sir.

JON	Is that what you were after?

DUBOIS	Nothing is as it appears, Mr. Stanton.

JON	It’s a Caravaggio. The Nativity with St. Francis… Rembrandt. It’s a bloody Rembrandt. 

DUBOIS	Bring the tubes. Be careful. Roll them gently.

JON	Do you know how much those paintings are worth?

BORZ	How much?

DUBOIS	Borz, time is of the essence.

JON	I don’t know. 60 to 80 million dollars.

BORZ	These paintings are worth 80 million?

JON	No. No, no. Each one.

BORZ	You told me these paintings were worth five million dollars max –

DUBOIS	We have an agreement. Set fee for services rendered. End of discussion.

JON	Jesus. Lily, Lily, get down!

DUBOIS	We don’t have time for this.

BORZ	I absolutely agree with you. Pull the trigger and see what happens.

DUBOIS	Do either of you know how to move fine art? You know.

BORZ	Twenty-five percent for the both of us, fifty percent for you. Or we can all go down here.

DUBOIS	You’re really coming into your own, you know that? Let’s go.

ALI	Get up. Get up!

GONZALEZ	Okay, okay.

BORZ	Nobody moves!

JON	No, no, no! Max!

BORZ	Sit down! Sit the fuck down! Or I shoot the kid.

ALI	Let him go.

BORZ	See? This is where we are different. Martinez?

GONZALEZ	Yeah?

BORZ	I guess this is a 50/50.

GONZALEZ	What!

MAX	Dad!

LILY	No! Daddy!

BORZ	You should’ve taken a day off.

JON	Quick! Quick! 

MAX	Dad! Dad, are you all right?

JON	Oh, it’s okay.

ALI	I underestimated you...

JON	Yeah, and I you. Your daddy gonna be fine. But right now I need you to be his water wings, okay? Okay, so grab this, right here. Hold it down.


LILY	Daddy?

JON	I’m okay.

LILY	Daddy. Are you okay?

JON	I’m all right. I’m okay.

ALI	Max, are you okay?

MAX	I’m fine. Get them!

JON /LILY	We’re gonna be okay.

POLICE	Go! Go! Go! Hold it!

BORZ	Oh my God! Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!

POLICE	Hold it right there.

BORZ	I’m a doorman. I’m just a doorman. A woman went crazy. She took a family hostage upstairs... She’s coming down the stairs right now, she’s got a gun!

POLICE	Alpha team, spread out! Move to the exit, sir. Move! Move! Move! Move! Seal the street.

BORZ	(into radio) Building’s surrounded. Plan B.

POLICE	Drop your weapon!

ALI	Wait! Wait! My brother-in-law’s wounded on the 10th floor. He needs a medic.

POLICE	Drop it NOW!

ALI	Please, it’s not me. It’s Borz, the doorman.

POLICE	Step away from the weapon and stand up slowly.

DUBOIS	I’m happy, Borz, you’ve changed. Merde.

BORZ	Yes I have. One hundred percent. Borz.

ALI	Borz!

BORZ	You’re persistent, Sergeant. I’ll give you that.

ALI	We have enough kissing ass to do around here, we don’t have to do it to each other...

BORZ	Let’s finish this. Ali, what are you doing! No, no, no, no! No! Fuck! Are you crazy?! I knew you were sick... I just didn’t realize how sick you were.

ALI	Well now you know.

BORZ	Fuck.

JON /LILY	Right. Do we have everything? Good.

ALI	Hey you.

MAX	I didn’t think I’d see you again.

ALI	Thought you’ get rid of me that easily, huh? How is he?

MAX	He’s all right. I’m sorry, Ali. This is all my fault. I couldn’t do it.

ALI	Do what?

MAX	Use the gun. I wasn’t the man you wanted me to be.

ALI	I really like the man you are. Come on.

LILY	Aunt Ali!

ALI	Hi! Hi. Hi.  I brought you something. 

LILY	The mint sauce!

ALI	With pine nuts. Of course.

JON	Where’s the lamb?

ALI	Ahh. Man. I knew I forgot something. How are you?

JON	Oh, I’ll manage. In a couple of weeks I’ll be back to my usual boring self.

DRIVER	Sir. We should go.

JON	Right. Jump in.

LILY	Bye Aunt Ali.

JON	What are you going to do?

ALI	Well, I won’t be working as a doorman.

JON	We’ll be back after they finish the renovations. Maybe you could join us in London, if you’re interested. I know the kids would love to see you.

ALI	The kids, what about you?

JON	See? I’m one of those tough guys who can cry.

ALI	Yes you are. Yes you are.

LILY	Bye Aunt Ali, we’ll miss you!
