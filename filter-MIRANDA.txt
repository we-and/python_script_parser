MIRANDA         No.
MIRANDA        Cool.
MIRANDA        Yeah, maybe.
MIRANDA        Why do you think I'm a vegetarian?
MIRANDA        [both chuckle]
MIRANDA        Hey, can we stop for a second?
MIRANDA        I have to go to the bathroom.
MIRANDA        It's-- it's not that.
MIRANDA        Fuck off.
MIRANDA        He's being weird.
MIRANDA        What is he--?
MIRANDA        Eddie!
MIRANDA        Why is he following, Eddie?
MIRANDA        Oh, no! Oh my God.
MIRANDA        Eddie!
MIRANDA        Eddie?
MIRANDA        Oh. Oh my God, Eddie.
MIRANDA        Oh my God, we gotta go.
MIRANDA        Please.
MIRANDA        No, no, no.
MIRANDA        Hello?
MIRANDA        Hello?
MIRANDA        My name is Miranda Cooper.
MIRANDA        I'm lost in the middle of the woods.
MIRANDA        Please, I need help. My stepdad has been shot.
MIRANDA        We just left a rest stop on the main highway.
MIRANDA        Please help him.
MIRANDA        Hello?
MIRANDA        Hello?
MIRANDA        Damn it.
MIRANDA         Mom, it's me. Um--
MIRANDA         Mom, Eddie's been shot. I'm lost in the woods.
MIRANDA         Some guy shot him and now he's after me.
MIRANDA         And I think I lost him, but I don't know.
MIRANDA         Mom, what should I do?
MIRANDA         I tried calling 911,
MIRANDA         but I don't know what else to do.
MIRANDA         Mom.
MIRANDA        Shit.
MIRANDA        Five, four, three, two, one.
MIRANDA        Five, four, three.

MIRANDA        I see some rocks.
MIRANDA        I see the sky.
MIRANDA        I see a creek.
MIRANDA        Five things I see.
MIRANDA        I see a tree.
MIRANDA        The river.
MIRANDA        A pine cone.
MIRANDA        A beetle.
MIRANDA        Oh, shit.
MIRANDA        Four things I touch.
MIRANDA        Tree trunk.
MIRANDA        My arms.
MIRANDA        A plant.
MIRANDA        A leaf.
MIRANDA        Three things I hear.
MIRANDA        An owl.
MIRANDA        A twig.
MIRANDA        Oh my God.
MIRANDA         Oh my God. He's coming.
MIRANDA        He's coming. Please, I need help.
MIRANDA        He's-he's old and bald,
MIRANDA        and wearing a jean jacket and he has a gun.
MIRANDA        Please, I need help. Please.
MIRANDA        Oh my God. I'm sorry. There's a crazy man after me.
MIRANDA        We have to run, let's go.
MIRANDA        There's a man, he shot my stepdad.
MIRANDA        We have to run, let's go!
MIRANDA        Help! Help!
MIRANDA        He's dead, my stepdad.
MIRANDA        A guy, he killed my stepdad,
MIRANDA        and now he's after me.
MIRANDA        No time for that. He has a gun!
MIRANDA        You have service?
MIRANDA        How can I get service?
MIRANDA        What's the password?
MIRANDA        No.
MIRANDA        Run!
MIRANDA         Mom, Eddie's been shot. I'm lost in the woods.
MIRANDA         Some guy shot him and now he's after me,
MIRANDA         and I think I lost him, but I don't know.
MIRANDA          Mom, what should I do?
MIRANDA         I tried calling 911,
MIRANDA         but I don't know what else to do. Mom.
MIRANDA         Mom?
MIRANDA        Yes! Fucking A!
MIRANDA         Mom?
MIRANDA         I'm okay. Eddie's--
MIRANDA         It all happened so fast.
MIRANDA         I didn't know what to do.
MIRANDA         He told me to run. I didn't want to,
MIRANDA         but he kept telling me to go.
MIRANDA         I'm so sorry, Mom.
MIRANDA         My battery is dying.
MIRANDA         Mom?
MIRANDA        Mom?
MIRANDA        I love you too.
MIRANDA        Oh my God. You're alive.
MIRANDA        You're hurt?
MIRANDA        Are you sure?
MIRANDA        Are you okay?
MIRANDA        I took it from that man.
MIRANDA        I'm sorry, I didn't think.
MIRANDA        I was just gonna get it to use the flashlight.
MIRANDA        I haven't been using it, I was afraid he'd see the light.
MIRANDA        Miranda.
MIRANDA        It's still bleeding.
MIRANDA        I don't know. He...
MIRANDA        followed us from a rest stop and just started shooting.
MIRANDA        He killed my stepdad, and I just ran.
MIRANDA        There's nothing you could've done.
MIRANDA        You're lucky you got away.
MIRANDA        It's okay. I'm not hungry.
MIRANDA        I-- I called 911 and my mom.
MIRANDA        She said people are looking for me.
MIRANDA        But he's still out there.
MIRANDA        What do you think we should do?
MIRANDA        Yeah, I took it from him too.
MIRANDA        Sorry, I always shake like that.
MIRANDA        Yeah.
MIRANDA        How close is it?
MIRANDA        Maybe we should make a run for it.
MIRANDA        I've never been camping before.
MIRANDA        Are you okay?
MIRANDA        Here, I have meds. Do you want some?
MIRANDA        I'm just supposed to take these every day, but I don't.
MIRANDA        Sometimes I have panic attacks.
MIRANDA        I haven't taken them in weeks.
MIRANDA        Doctor says they'll help.
MIRANDA        A year ago, my father killed himself.
MIRANDA        And I was the one who found him.
MIRANDA        They tried all different kinds of drugs.
MIRANDA        They all make me feel like shit.
MIRANDA        Please. It might help with the pain.
MIRANDA        Me too.
MIRANDA        Here.
MIRANDA        Mushrooms?
MIRANDA        Todd.
MIRANDA        Hey Todd, I found some more food.
MIRANDA        The sun's rising. We should head out.
MIRANDA        Todd.
MIRANDA        Shit.
MIRANDA TO MIGUEL        Daddy! 
MIRANDA        Daddy?
MIRANDA        Daddy?
MIRANDA        What?
MIRANDA        I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do.
MIRANDA        Five things I see.
MIRANDA        One. 
MIRANDA        One.
MIRANDA        Two.
MIRANDA        Three.
MIRANDA        Four.
MIRANDA        Five.
MIRANDA        Six.
MIRANDA        Seven.
MIRANDA        Eight.
MIRANDA        Nine.
MIRANDA        Help! Help! Help!
MIRANDA        Help! He's right behind me!
MIRANDA        Emily? 
MIRANDA        Here it is. This is where Todd is.
MIRANDA        It's almost straight in from here.
MIRANDA        I left a backpack to mark the spot.
MIRANDA        It was his mom's.
MIRANDA        So, that's his name.
MIRANDA        Yeah, that's it. And he was pissed.
MIRANDA        I'm just so hungry.
MIRANDA         Mom?
MIRANDA        Get away from her!
MIRANDA        Did she do that to your face?
MIRANDA        Is that why you chose me?
MIRANDA        Is that why you killed my stepdad
MIRANDA        and followed me through the woods?
MIRANDA        Because I look like your dead wife?
MIRANDA         No, Mom.
MIRANDA        You're pathetic.
MIRANDA        You're nothing.
MIRANDA        Eddie and Todd and even my dad,
MIRANDA        who was out of his mind, were better men than you.
MIRANDA        You're a worthless piece of shit,
MIRANDA        and I look like your dead wife?
MIRANDA        But I'm not dead. I'm alive!
MIRANDA        Ah! Emily! Help me! Help me!
MIRANDA         Mom! No, no!
MIRANDA        Get off!
MIRANDA        Stop!MIRANDA        
MIRANDA         Mom.
MIRANDA         I love you.
MIRANDA         I fixed it.
MIRANDA         Eddie... Dad...
MIRANDA         The last thing he said was...
MIRANDA         "Tell your mother I love her."
MIRANDA         I'm so sorry, Mom.
MIRANDA         What?
MIRANDA         Right-- right now?
MIRANDA         Oh-- Oh my gosh.
MIRANDA         Oh, my God.
MIRANDA         Okay. Okay. Okay, Mom. Breathe.
MIRANDA         Breathe, Mom. Breathe.
MIRANDA        Oh, my God. The bag.
MIRANDA AND JENNY        I got the bag.
MIRANDA AND JENNY        Come on. I got the bag. Go. Go, go, go.
