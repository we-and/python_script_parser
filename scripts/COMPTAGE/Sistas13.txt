ZAC	Oh, so now you're worried about her being mad, you like when she's mad at you.	
DANNI	No, I don't.  You do.	
ZAC	You know what, I'm gonna tell her.  Can I--can I just tell her during my own time?  Damn.	
DANNI	Okay.	
ZAC	(sighs) I'm serious Danni.	
DANNI	You know, you better tell her quick because this town talks like…	
ZAC	Like, like you?  Yes, I know.  I know.  The town talks like you but can I tell her, like, just one time?	
DANNI	You know, I, I would love to be a fly on the wall at dinner with you two tonight?	
ZAC	Oh, no, no, no.	
DANNI	Just…	
ZAC	I'm not--I'm not telling her tonight.  I'm not.	
DANNI	You a damn fool, you know that?	
ZAC	I can't tell--we just had the most amazing dinner.	
DANNI	Yeah.  So please don't tell me about your night.	
ZAC	Danni, it was--Danni, it was just so good.	
DANNI	I've seen you naked.	
ZAC	Danni.	
DANNI	And I know what you're working with.

PAM	She said she was upset and then she shot herself.	
DANNI	Okay.  So where is she?	
PAM	She's dead.	
DANNI	Pam, I'm talking about Karen.

KAREN	Hey, you reached Karen Mott, leave a message after the beep.	
ANDI	Hey Karen, it's me.  Call me back.	
SABRINA	Hey.	
ANDI	Hey.	
SABRINA	What's going on?	
ANDI	Have you talked to Karen?	
SABRINA	No, not yet.  What's up?	
ANDI	Gary.	
SABRINA	And what about him?	
ANDI	I saw his wife again.  And, um, she came to my firm and…	
SABRINA	Right.  I know all of that.	
ANDI	Well, what you don't know is that, um, she came over here with Gary.  I mean, I was gonna come for him anyway, but she…	
SABRINA	Oh, Andi, no, no, no.  Are you--I can be there in 25 minutes, okay?	
ANDI	Okay.	
SABRINA	Okay.  I'm on my way.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
SABRINA	Bye.  I'll be right back.	
ANDI	Go away.	
GARY	I left my key card.	
ANDI	(sniffles) She left it all.  You may as well take it with you.	
GARY	Why?  She's just gonna get it anyway.	
ANDI	Gary, this is a lot.	
GARY	(sighs) I get it.	
ANDI	I don't wanna do this anymore.	
GARY	No, you don't have to say anything.  This is my fault. Yo, I  it up.  I met you, and I fell in love.  And I was married.	
ANDI	Why are you doing this?	
GARY	I should've left her first then none of this would be happening.  Baby, you're a good--you're a good woman.  You did your best.  You don't deserve to be in the middle of my bullshit.  I'm sorry.  I…(sniffles) I won't bother you again, all right?  (sighs)	
ANDI	Gary?	
GARY	I never lied to you.  I never did.	
ANDI	I know.	
GARY	I wish I could take this all back.  (sniffles) You know, but I can't, so.  (sighs) Look, I know you can't say anything and shit, I don't even know what the  I'm saying, but I mean it, I will give her anything she wants as long as I can have you.	
ANDI	She's gonna sue my firm and have me disbarred.	
GARY	What, what can I do to stop her?  And what can I do to help?  I, I can go back to her like you wanted me to.  I would do that.	
ANDI	Thank you.	
GARY	But I won't be able to see you anymore.	
ANDI	I know.	
GARY	You're so  cold.	
ANDI	Gary, I'm just trying to process all of this.	
GARY	Did you not love me at all?	
ANDI	Of course, I do.	
GARY	Okay.  Then tell me to stay.  Tell me that it's gonna be okay.  Tell me to give up everything.  Tell me that you will give up everything for me.	
ANDI	You know I worked my ass off to get to that firm.	
GARY	And I have too.  But you mean more to me than any of that, but I don't mean more to you in yours.	
ANDI	Gary, think about what you're saying.	
GARY	I have.	
ANDI	You're asking me to give up my life and career for you and…	
GARY	Yes, Andi.  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.	
ANDI	Gary, that's insane, why would I--why would I do that?  That's nothing…	
GARY	Because I can take care of us.	
ANDI	I don't want to be taken care of.	
GARY	Well, you're the only woman I've ever met that didn't want that.	
ANDI	Well, I'm sorry.	
GARY	Okay.  I'll go stay in that hellhole so you can be happy.	
ANDI	Don't turn this around on me.	
GARY	Look, that's not what I'm doing.  I'm just telling you the truth.	
ANDI	Okay.	
GARY	Still so cold.	
ANDI	I'm not being cold. Gary.  Gary, we could still…	
ZAC	Can you drive any slower?	
DANNI	I can't.	
ZAC	You--I--clearly you can, because you're driving slow.	
DANNI	I'm riding dirty, man.	
ZAC	What?	
DANNI	Yeah, okay?	
ZAC	Yo, you got to let me off this car, Danni.	
DANNI	All right.	
ZAC	I'm serious.	
DANNI	Be my guest.	
ZAC	Pull over.	
DANNI	No.	
ZAC	I'm on probation, yo.	
DANNI	I know that.  That's why I'm driving the speed limit, okay?  Chill, big D.	
ZAC	What?	
DANNI	That's my new nickname for you.	
ZAC	It's not funny, Danni.	
DANNI	I know that, okay.	
ZAC	Like, like, this is serious, like, for once in your life, can you be serious?	
DANNI	I know that.	
ZAC	I can't believe she was with another man.	
DANNI	What are you talking about?	
ZAC	The woman that killed herself asked Karen to leave her husband alone.	
DANNI	Well…(sighs)	
ZAC	Well, what?  What?	
DANNI	Wait, I know you don't have an attitude.	
ZAC	(clicks tongue) Why don't we take it outside, whatever, Danni.	
DANNI	Wait a minute, you out here with a baby mama, and you mad?	
ZAC	Uh…	
DANNI	Ugh, uh, uh…	
ZAC	Yeah.  I wonder who this dude is.	
DANNI	Oh, I don't know.	
ZAC	You know.	
DANNI	No, I don't.	
ZAC	Yeah, you do, you just been lying all the time.	
DANNI	Zac, I'm not lying.	
ZAC	Okay.  I know you're lying.  Dang.  You know, I talk about everything.	
DANNI	Well, not lately.	
ZAC	Whatever, Danni.  I'm telling you she was with another dude.	
DANNI	Boy, if you don't…	
ZAC	I wonder--do I know who he is, I know who he is, that's the dude that was at her house.	
DANNI	Who?	
ZAC	The dude she was trying to clown me in front of him.  That's him.  I know that's him.	
DANNI	Zac.	
ZAC	What?	
DANNI	Are you really mad?	
ZAC	Yes.	
DANNI	Okay.  This should be fun.	
ZAC	How--well, how is this fun?  What are you talking about?	
DANNI	Um, uh, this should be a riot, you know?  You tell her about her man after you tell them about you and your new bundle of joy.	
ZAC	Whatever, Danni.	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.  No, this is gonna be fun.	
ZAC	No.  How, how can you find fun in this?  A person lost their life, like, can you just show some respect?	
DANNI	You don't care nothing about her and I don't know her either.	
ZAC	You know, you going to hell, like, straight to hell.	
DANNI	See you there.	
ZAC	I'm not going.	
DANNI	Oh, okay.	
ZAC	I'm not, I have feelings.	
DANNI	Because you and ain't Saint Peter like this, right?	
ZAC	Can you speed up, Danni, please?	
DANNI	I'm riding dirty.	
ZAC	I can't believe this is my life, bro.	
DANNI	I'll speed up.  You go right to jail and got to see you no more.  I'll bring you commissary money, though.	
ZAC	Okay.  Just, just do, do the speed limit.	
DANNI	Uh-hmm.	
SABRINA	So do I.	
ANDI	You don't understand.  I could lose everything.	
SABRINA	Slow down, okay?  Let's see what's going on first.	
ANDI	Yeah.  I don't know.	
SABRINA	Well, how do you feel?	
ANDI	What do you mean?	
SABRINA	About him.	
ANDI	I'm a mess, obviously.	
SABRINA	I know, I know.  Just tell me.	
ANDI	He's telling the truth.  But I keep thinking that he's running a game.	
SABRINA	Hmm.  Andi, I don't know.	
ANDI	Yeah.  I just can't stop thinking about his wife saying that he was controlling and abusive.  Maybe that is his game.	
SABRINA	Andi…	
ANDI	What?  I'm serious.	
SABRINA	I mean, he would have to be doing a lot to be putting all this together.	
ANDI	Well, that's not what I mean I just mean that, like, I believe him.  He confronted me in front of his wife.	
SABRINA	I'm sorry.	
ANDI	And he wants me to leave my job.  Exactly.	
SABRINA	Yeah, I'm sorry.	
ANDI	I need to talk to Karen.  (sniffles)	
SABRINA	What am I?	
ANDI	Oh, no.  I--I didn't mean it like that.  I just mean that she's, like, she gives all the sage advice.  You give good advice, too.  (chuckles)	
SABRINA	You need to be talking to Ms. Lisa then.	
ANDI	Yeah, that would be even better.	
SABRINA	Uh-hmm.	
ANDI	Hmm.	
SABRINA	Oh, it's Danni.	
ANDI	Oh, no.	
SABRINA	What?	
ANDI	You know she's gonna go off on me if I tell her about this.	
SABRINA	Why?	
ANDI	Because Gary wants to take care of me and she's gonna say I'm a damn fool for not letting him.	
SABRINA	(inhales) You're right.	
ANDI	Exactly.	
SABRINA	She might cuss you out.	
ANDI	(chuckles) Don't tell her.	
SABRINA	Hey, girl.  What did you do now?  Is she all right?  Okay.  Okay.  I'm with Andi now.  We're gonna make our way.  All right.  Which hospital?  Okay.  All right.  We're going now.  I'll see you in a minute.	
ANDI	What happened?	
SABRINA	Um, I don't know.  She said some lady killed herself at Karen's salon.	
ANDI	What?	
SABRINA	Yeah.  Uh, I'm not sure but I think we should go over there now.	
ANDI	Okay.  Is--is everything okay.  Are you…	
SABRINA	Oh, no, girl.  Let's go.	
ANDI	Okay.  Okay.  All right.	
SABRINA	Get your purse.	
DANNI	Hi.  Uh, we're here to see Karen Mott.	
NURSE BEATRICE	And you are?	
ZAC	My name…	
DANNI	I'm her twin, and this is her husband.	
ZAC	Yeah.	
NURSE BEATRICE	Oh, okay.  Right this way.	
DANNI	Uh-hmm. Lovely.  Great personality.	
NURSE BEATRICE	Thank you.	
KAREN	Hey.	
DANNI	Hey.  Hey.	
ZAC	(sighs) Are you okay?  Are you all right?	
KAREN	Yeah.	
DANNI	Girl, what happened?	
KAREN	I don't know.  I don't.	
DANNI	Who was she?  Do you know?	
KAREN	Just some woman.  I don't even know her.	
DANNI	Okay.  So you're okay, like, no, like grazed bullet.  I don't know.  I'm just--I'm…	
KAREN	Danni, she shot herself in front of me.	
DANNI	No.	
KAREN	Yeah.	
DANNI	Right in front of you?	
KAREN	Yeah.	
DANNI	Shit.	
KAREN	I can't believe it.	
ZAC	Pam said you were--you were seeing her husband?	
KAREN	No, no.	
ZAC	Why--why would she say that, though?	
KAREN	That's what she said?	
ZAC	Yeah.  But why would she say that if you weren't?	
DANNI	(clears throat)	
ZAC	Are you--are you okay?  Is there something in your throat?  This is the hospital, they have stuff for that.	
DANNI	No.  Um, there's gonna be something wrong with your ass in a minute.	
ZAC	Shut up, Danni.  Don't.  Why would--why would she say that?  Why would she say that?  Maybe--like, why?	
KAREN	I only spent some time with the man, Zac, okay?  Just time.	
ZAC	Who is he, though? Are you okay?	
KAREN	Why are you asking me about him?	
DANNI	Seriously.	
ZAC	I'm…	
DANNI	I told you.	
ZAC	I'm just trying to make sense of all this, like, this…	
KAREN	By questioning me right now?	
DANNI	Move back.	
KAREN	Right now is the best time?	
ZAC	No.  No.	
KAREN	Good.	
ZAC	No.	
KAREN	Because now is not the time.	
DANNI	Now say you're sorry.	
KAREN	Okay?	
DANNI	Say "You're right."	
ZAC	You're right.  You're right.	
KAREN	I've never been through anything like this.	
DANNI	Now, say you're sorry.  Just say you're sorry.	
ZAC	You're sorry.  I mean, I'm sorry.  I mean, I'm sorry.  I'm just--it got me too.	
DANNI	Hey, girl, are they keeping you here?  You good?

DANNI	Okay.  I'll--I'll go find him, yeah?	
ZAC	Yeah.  You go find him.	
KAREN	Okay.

DANNI	Shut the hell up.	
ZAC	Okay.  I'll go talk to her.  Thank you, Danni, for getting the doctor.  We really appreciate you in this time of need.  So glad that you're here.  Are you okay?	
KAREN	I can't believe this.	
ZAC	I mean--I mean, when you're messing around with somebody, sometimes you don't know how it's gonna affect you.	
KAREN	I wasn't messing with him, Zac.	
ZAC	No, I--I wasn't saying you.  I was just saying sometimes, like, like, when you've been--like, accidents happen and things happen, other people get affected, kids, babies, you know?	
KAREN	No.  What are--what are you talking about?	
ZAC	I'm--are you okay?  That's really what I was focusing on.	
KAREN	I'm fine.  I just wanna go home.	
ZAC	I--I'm just--all right.  We're gonna--I'm gonna make sure the nurse--are you pregnant?	
KAREN	What?	
ZAC	No.  I'm not asking you--I'm just hypothetically because all this, if you was pregnant by accident.  I'm just saying that I would be forgiving.	
KAREN	Zac.  Zac…	
ZAC	Because if it was me and I was pregnant, I know you'd be forgive…	
KAREN	Zac, take me home.	
ZAC	I'm gonna--nurse?	
KAREN	Please.	
ZAC	Um, Danni was supposed to get the nurse.

ZAC	Trust her?  I'm watching him with her.	
ANDI	Zac, now is not the time.
