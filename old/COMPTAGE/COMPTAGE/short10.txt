THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...Trying to do too much at once. 

THOMAS	When The Fat Controller asked me and Samson to take some trucks to the docks, Samson was determined to show everyone how clever he was.

THOMAS	The trucks were heavy, so I decided to take a few at a time. But silly Samson tried to take all his trucks in one go.

THOMAS	On the way back to get the rest of my trucks, I found Samson stuck at the bottom of Gordon's Hill. His trucks were just too heavy to pull.

THOMAS	Paxton helped me to push Samson over the hill. But now Samson was so late, he wouldn't stop to let me be un-coupled!

THOMAS	When we finally reached the Docks, The Fat Controller wasn't happy. He told Samson that by trying to pull too many trucks in one go, he had caused Confusion and Delay! 

THOMAS	That's why it's important not to do too much at once!
