ISSIE	That’s the guy that tried to take Blaze.

CAROLINE	That’s Adam Carter.

ISSIE	Why is Dan so hung up on this internship thing anyway?

CAROLINE	He’s always been obsessed with being a vet.

BIANCA	Everyone wants to ride for Dulmoth Park.

NATASHA	We’re not horrible and elitist, like you guys.

CAROLINE	You told Issie you were gay, you never gave me a second thought.

CALEB	You know you’re a motor mouth.

SAM	I’m moving Aramis.

NATASHA	What?

ISSIE	It’s them, the Kauri Point herd.

ISSIE	So that’s why Adam was chasing Blaze, because he was after the herd. He’s gonna come back for her.

ISSIE	A in your dad’s phone is Adam Carter.

NATASHA	My dad’s a liar and a horse thief.

ISSIE	I mean, how many places are there to hide a herd of horses?

CALEB	Well they’ve kept themselves hidden for the past two hundred years, so, probably quite a few.

STELLA	I still can’t believe you found them, and then lost them.

CAROLINE	I still can’t believe we’re missing the Champs today.

STELLA	Did you hear Laurieston Farm pulled out?

DAN	What?

STELLA	They had to have a horse put down.

ISSIE	Why?

STELLA	There was an accident. Something to do with a cattle grid.

CAROLINE	Cattle grid?

DAN	Oh that sounds brutal.

CAROLINE	So Dulmoth Park are gonna walk away with the trophy then?

CALEB	We probably would have been banned anyway, Caroline. Mum was furious with us after yesterday.

CAROLINE	She even got cross with Caleb. It was really cool.

DAN	Yeah, my mum doesn’t believe us.

ISSIE	Why, what did she say?

DAN	She’s convinced that we just saw a bunch of farm horses.

ISSIE	Yep, my mum doesn’t believe us either. Sucks, doesn’t it.

DAN	Yeah.

DAN	Hey, has anyone heard from Natasha.

CAROLINE	She’s probably in hiding. I would be if my dad was a horse thief.

CALEB	Sensitive as ever.

CAROLINE	What?

CALEB	Nothing, I just meant… doesn’t matter.

STELLA	Are you sure they weren’t farm horses? In the barn?

ALL	Stella.

STELLA	Ok, ok, I was just checking.

ISSIE	No, it was definitely the herd, and if Adam thinks he’s gonna get his hands on Blaze, I’m not gonna let that happen.

TOM	Hey, I’m heading out, I won’t be back until this afternoon. But, um, your mum dropped this off for you. It’s from Australia.

CAROLINE	Do you think it’s about your internship?

CALEB	What does it say?

STELLA	It would be so awesome.

CAROLINE	Yeah.

STELLA	Why are you wearing a Dulmoth Park kit?

NATASHA	Ah, yeah, um, I’m, you know how my dad said he was moving Aramis to a different stable? Well it’s Dulmoth Park.

CAROLINE	What?

NATASHA	So, um, yeah, I’m gonna be riding at the champs with them.

STELLA	What, you’re leaving us?

ISSIE	Wow, I didn’t have you down as a traitor.

NATASHA	It, wasn’t my choice, my dad won’t let me keep Aramis here anymore, thanks to the website you put up.

ISSIE	You know he’s trying to buy you off, right?

NATASHA	I didn’t want this.

ISSIE	Oh, yeah, poor you, riding in the champs, like it’s not your dream.

NATASHA	You really don’t get it, do you. Well, don’t worry, you don’t have to see me anymore.

ISSIE	Dan? What did the letter say?

DAN	It said no. Apparently, they don’t think I’m quite ready yet, my dad is going to love this. You know he said I was aiming too high.

ISSIE	That isn’t true.

CAROLINE	What?

DAN	Can we not talk about it?

CAROLINE	Ok.

DAN	Thanks. Wait, why was Natasha wearing Dulmoth Park colours.

TOM	Here’s that letter from Hexronn.

MITCH	Thanks, this might be useful.

TOM	What are you doing Mitch?

MITCH	Collating evidence.

TOM	What are you hoping to find?

MITCH	Secrets, Tom.

AMANDA	The drain’s backed up Mum.

MITCH	Oh, not again, why can’t you wash your hair once a week, like a normal person.

AMANDA	Because that’s disgusting… oh, hi, Tom. I, um, actually, I wanted to speak to you anyway.

TOM	Oh, why, what have I done now?

AMANDA	No, nothing, um, actually, that Adam Carter guy. Is he dangerous?

TOM	Honestly? I think he’s just after the horses.

AMANDA	So you believe the kids when they say they found this Kauri Point herd?

TOM	I do. I mean they wind me up, but they wouldn’t lie to me, not about this.

AMANDA	God, what is Sam doing?

TOM	I don’t like the guy, I never have and I know he’s your, boyfriend.

AMANDA	Yeah, I mean, we dated, technically, but also, not, so.

TOM	Anyway. I think there’s something else going on here, the man is not short of cash. Now why would he do it?

SAM	Hey, do you know where you’re going?

NATASHA	Yep, you can go.

SAM	Oh, but I want to…

NATASHA	I don’t need you here.

SAM	But I want to see my girl do her stuff.

NATASHA	I know what this is. You’re hoping I’ll forget what you’ve done. Doesn’t work like that dad.

SAM	I’m trying to cheer you up, Natasha. This is the champs, this is all you’ve talked about since you first got on a pony, and here you are. Now’s your chance.

NATASHA	Just go.

SAM	Fine. Good luck.

ANNOUNCER	Welcome to the pony club championships, we’ll be getting underway in a few minutes, but could our first team please make their way to the ring and report to the Steward.

BIANCA	Finally, we’ve all put our names down, you’re going last.

NATASHA	Great.

BIANCA	This is gonna be a bit of a change for you, eh?

NATASHA	What?

BIANCA	Oh, being on the winning team for once.

NATASHA	That’s a bit presumptuous, we haven’t even ridden yet.

BIANCA	Yeah, that’s the attitude I expect from a KP loser.

NATASHA	Excuse me?

BIANCA	I just don’t think you’re up to it, personally, but your dad brought you a place in the team, so, you better not let us down.

NATASHA	Yeah, you better not keep getting in my face.

BIANCA	Or what?

NICOLE	Hey guys, Team photo, come on everybody, get in.

BIANCA	Come on guys.

ISSIE	Ugh, Dulmoth Park have just posted from the Champs. Get ready to hurl.

DAN	Hashtag Hand Us Our Trophy.

ISSIE	Natasha doesn’t look that happy.

CALEB	You kidding? The Champs are Natasha heaven.

DAN	Oh, no way, it’s Patrick Freeman. He’s the one running the internship.

ISSIE	Looks full of himself. You wouldn’t have wanted to work with him anyway.

CAROLINE	Dan, something’s up with Treacle.

DAN	What’s wrong, what’s wrong?

CAROLINE	He’s been coughing so much, and look at him.

DAN	Call Tom.

RICHARD	Well, look who it is.

TOM	Kia ora Rich.

RICHARD	What brings you all the way man, it’s quite the drive from Kauri Point.

TOM	Yeah, well, I’m looking for somebody.

RICHARD	Are ya?

TOM	Adam Carter.

RICHARD	Adam Carter?

TOM	Yeah, he used to be your apprentice, right? Have you seen him?

RICHARD	Yeah, not for years.

TOM	Do you know where I might find him?

RICHARD	I don’t know why you’d want to, what’s he done?

TOM	Have you heard anything about the sale of wild horses?

RICHARD	Nah.

TOM	Not necessarily legit.

RICHARD	Ah, well.

TOM	Yeah?

RICHARD	Ah, some of the stable lads were talking the other day, you know what they’re like, this, load of rubbish mainly, but, have you heard the name Marchetti?

TOM	Marchetti?

RICHARD	Yeah. I don’t know what it was about, sounded off the books. You think Adam’s involved?

TOM	Yeah, I don’t know. But thanks, and next time you’re in Kauri Point, give us a call. I’ve got some horses you can shoe.

RICHARD	You couldn’t afford me mate. Hey, I was down at the International’s before Christmas, shoeing at Puhinui, remembering your glory days. You still not riding?

TOM	Nah. Those days are long gone mate.

RICHARD	It’s a shame what happened to you Tom. Would have shaken up anyone.

TOM	Cheers Rich.

CALEB	The vet’s not answering either.

CAROLINE	What do we do Dan? What’s wrong with him?

ISSIE	What is that green stuff coming out of his nose?

DAN	I think he’s having trouble swallowing. I wonder if it’s choke.

STELLA	Is it bad?

DAN	Maybe. There’s a blockage here. It’s not shifting.

CAROLINE	The vet’s not answering, Tom’s not here, what do we do?

DAN	I don’t know, but we need to move fast.

ISSIE	Natasha, it’s Issie, um, I owe you a massive apology, I know I was harsh this morning, but the thing is, we really need you.

ANNOUNCER	There are several teams still to jump, this is turning out to be a tightly fought competition.

BIANCA	What are you doing? You’re on in a minute, you should be warming up.

NATASHA	You know what Bianca? I don’t think I want to ride for Dulmoth Park after all.

BIANCA	Excuse me? Why?

NATASHA	I guess it’s ‘cause you’re all a bunch of hateful, stuck up, cows. Here you go.

NATASHA	Sorry, excuse me.

PATRICK	Yes, who do I make it out to?

NATASHA	No, no, no, I need you to come with me.

PATRICK	Sorry?

NATASHA	I need your help, I mean, look, do you save horses or do you just write about it?

DAN	Alright, he’s hot, we need to keep him calm and cool him down. Caroline grab the sponge. And let’s get rid of all the food, Stella can you the hay net out?

CAROLINE	You’ll be ok Treacle.

DAN	Is that Tom?

NATASHA	Hey guys. This is Patrick Freeman.

CALEB	Aren’t you that vet?

PATRICK	Where’s this horse?

ISSIE	This way.

PATRICK	What’s going on?

DAN	Hi. Um, yeah, I think he’s got choke. I think. He’s got blockage here, I tried to palpate it, but…

PATRICK	Good work. Ok, yep, it is choke. Ok, so, have you ever administered a naso-gastric tube before?

DAN	No, but I can. I mean, I’ve watched videos of it being done.

PATRICK	Good. Just ah…

CAROLINE	I can’t watch this.

CALEB	Caz. He’s gonna be fine.

CAROLINE	This is a punishment isn’t it.

CALEB	What?

CAROLINE	For being a horrible person. The kind of person a brother can’t come out to.

CALEB	You’re not a horrible person. And strictly speaking its Treacle being punished but I like how you made it all about you.

CAROLINE	You see.

CALEB	I’m joking. Look. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.

CAROLINE	No. You were right not to. I am a motor mouth.

CALEB	No, it’s not that.

CAROLINE	I don’t blame you. For not trusting me.

CALEB	No, Caz. I didn’t tell you, because you matter the most, and I was worried it would change things between us and I didn’t want to lose you.

CAROLINE	It’s true. I guess you would be lost without me.

CALEB	Mmm hmm. Although, you are a motor mouth, but that’s just you. Caz. I didn’t mean to hurt you.

CAROLINE	Well you did.

CALEB	I should have trusted you.

CAROLINE	It must have been hard, carrying that secret around. I’m glad you did say something, even if it was to Issie.

CALEB	Thanks. I’ve missed you.

CAROLINE	We can stop doing this now, I know you hate it.

CALEB	Come on, let’s go check on Treacle.

CAROLINE	Is he ok?

PATRICK	He’s going to be fine.

CAROLINE	That’s amazing. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

PATRICK	I don’t know many kids who know how to handle a naso-gastric tube.

DAN	Yeah, I don’t get out much.

PATRICK	You’re obviously interested in Veterinary science?

DAN	Yeah, kinda.

ISSIE	Kinda?

PATRICK	Well you’ve got a talent for it. You should keep going.

ISSIE	That’s a bit rich. I mean, you’re right, he’s brilliant, look what he did, and you turned him away from the internship. That is so stupid, why would you not want him?

DAN	Issie.

ISSIE	No, he should know.

PATRICK	It’s ok, she’s right. I should. What did you say your name was again?

DAN	Daniel Townley.

PATRICK	Ok.

NATASHA	What caused it? The choke.

PATRICK	Anything that’s difficult to swallow.

CALEB	Something like this?

PATRICK	Well it’s small, but yes, if he chewed a lot of them up at once. What is it?

CALEB	I don’t know. Some kind of plastic pellet.

NATASHA	Sorry for dragging you away.

PATRICK	Don’t be, this is way more interesting than signing books. Well, I will leave this in your capable hands, Daniel Townley.

DAN	Yeah, sure, sure, got it. Surreal. Wow, I can’t believe Patrick Freeman was here. Thanks Nats.

CAROLINE	Yeah thanks, you’re the best.

ISSIE	How did Champs go?

STELLA	Yeah, did Dulmoth Park clean up?

NATASHA	I hope not.

CALEB	Why? You don’t wanna win?

NATASHA	I do want to win, but, next year, with you lot.

CAROLINE	What do you mean?

NATASHA	I mean, I didn’t ride, I left.

DAN	You walked out on Bianca?

NATASHA	Yep.

ISSIE	You legend.

NATASHA	It was worth it to see the look on her face.

CAROLINE	Well, it was super cool of you to do that for Treacle.

NATASHA	I wouldn’t have known about it if Issie hadn’t called me, it was her idea.

DAN	Nice one London.

ISSIE	Sure.

DAN	I can’t see anything.

CALEB	I think I found them somewhere around here. Here look. More.

DAN	What are they?

CALEB	There’s heaps this way.

DAN	What do you think they’re for? There are hundreds.

CALEB	Over here.

DAN	Hexronn.

FRANKIE	Hey. I’m looking for Tom. He around?

STELLA	No, he’s been out all day.

FRANKIE	Oh, that is a beautiful horse.

CAROLINE	He’s been real sick.

STELLA	Yeah, he had choke.

FRANKIE	No way, oh that sucks, choke’s the worst, it’s really scary.

CAROLINE	Yeah, it was.

FRANKIE	Poor you. Oh, I love your bracelet. That’s awesome.

STELLA	Thanks, Caroline made it.

FRANKIE	What? You could sell those.

CAROLINE	Really? There’s this market on Saturday with this really cool bead store, you should check it out.

FRANKIE	Oh, that’d be sweet, but I’m only in town for a couple of days.

TOM	Everything alright? Caleb said you had everything under control. Sounds like you had a bit of a rough time.

CAROLINE	Yeah.

TOM	Hey boy, how are ya?

CAROLINE	It was amazing actually. There was like this superhero vet and then Natasha missed Champs and Dan like, basically performed surgery.

FRANKIE	Hi, I’m Frankie Pines, I wondered if we might have a chat in private.

TOM	Yeah, ok, sure. This way.

NATASHA	One, two, three.

ISSIE	You know, I think my biceps are getting bigger since I stared here.

ISSIE	Sorry, you could have won.

NATASHA	It wouldn’t have felt like winning. You know, it’s kind of inconvenient, I think we’re supposed to be friends.

ISSIE	Yeah. I think you’re right.

NATASHA	I know I should have said this a long time ago, but, welcome to the KP Team.

ISSIE	Thanks, and, welcome back? I mean I guess you are back, right?

NATASHA	Definitely. Also, if you did like Dan, then that’s cool with me. I’m totally over him, he’s not really my type anyway.

ISSIE	Ok.

NATASHA	I’m gonna go find the others, you got this?

ISSIE	Um, sure.

TOM	I don’t understand. I scanned her when she came here, why didn’t it register then.

FRANKIE	Hey, I’ve heard it happens all the time, the tech switches constantly, I think it’s a ruse to get more money out of us, it’s like a total headache. Anyway, I’ll go get the horse float if you could get her ready.

TOM	Yeah, but, um, I’ll still need to see some paperwork.

FRANKIE	Really, but she’s registered to me, you just saw that.

TOM	Yeah, but, bill of sale.  I need to see that.

FRANKIE	Yeah, sure. Sweet, I will go that for you. It’s so good to see her again, you ready to go home Darcy.

ISSIE	What are you doing with Blaze?

ISSIE	You can’t, you can’t just hand her over to that woman.

TOM	I’m not just handing her over.

ISSIE	Blaze is wild. You know she is.

TOM	She can’t be Issie, she’s chipped.

ISSIE	Well you checked her when she first came and there wasn’t one.

TOM	I guess I got it wrong.

ISSIE	No. Somebody messed with her, at the trials. I’m sure I saw Adam Carter. I told you. I mean maybe he did it then, maybe they’re working together.

TOM	Ok, stop. I know you want this to not be true, but she has a registered chip, what do you have? You found her on the side of the road. I can’t fight her on that Issie. I’m sorry.

ISSIE	Ok, well, at least let me bring her in, let me say goodbye.

TOM	Sure.

FRANKIE	It’s me. He’s playing hardball. I need you to do something.

NATASHA	I don’t believe it.

CAROLINE	How do these turn in to plastic bottles?

CALEB	Well there seems to be a blow moulding process.

STELLA	They just do.

DAN	So Hexronn’s moving into single use plastics now?

CALEB	It’s literally the most polluting thing they could do.

NATASHA	He promised Fantail would stay eco-friendly, like that’s his whole thing, he knows how important it is. He lied to me. To everyone.

SAM	Oh, hey, hi, excuse me, I need to speak to Julia, is she around?

IC	Expansion meeting.

SAM	What? I should be in that meeting. When’s she getting back?

IC	Tomorrow.

IC	Yes.

IC	What do you think you’re doing?

SAM	These are international orders, look, there’s stacks of them. Fantail can’t produce this much water, never mind the carbon footprint.

IC	This is classified.

TOM	Oh no.

TOM	What’s she done now?

TOM	Where’s Issie?

DAN	We haven’t seen her in a while. Why?

TOM	I think she’s done something really stupid.

DAN	So this owner’s really legit?

TOM	She’s got a registered chip and here’s proof of sale.

NATASHA	Hey, I want to come too.

TOM	No, you stay here.

NATASHA	No, Tom, please.

TOM	Ok, come on then.

FRANKIE	Hey, ready to roll?

TOM	Hey, yeah, ah, yeah, slight problem, Issie’s just taken Blaze for a quick ride and um, well, I’ll be, I’ll be back shortly, so, you just ah…

FRANKIE	What?

FRANKIE	But?

FRANKIE	You’ll never believe this, the kid’s done a runner on the horse.

ADAM	Yep, I’m on it, I’m on it. Go Hades, go, go, go.

FRANKIE	Take her to the others, tell them we’ve got to move on this.

ADAM	What about the girl?

FRANKIE	Just leave her.

NATASHA	Issie. Issie.

DAN	Do you think she’s ok?

NATASHA	Issie? Issie? Issie?

ISSIE	Where’s Blaze? Blaze?

TOM	Hey.
