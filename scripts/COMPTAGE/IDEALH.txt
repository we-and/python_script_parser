POLICE OFFICER	Albuquerque Police, open the door, please.

POLICE OFFICER	Open up.

KID	Dad, wake up, wake up.

POLICE OFFICER	Albuquerque Police, open up.

BEAU	Fuck. All right, we got to go.

BEAU	Get your shoes on.

POLICE OFFICER	Open up.

CRACK HEAD LADY	Piece of shit knocks me around and then steals my Chanel purse...

CRACK HEAD LADY	and that was real fuckin’ Chanel!

POLICE OFFICER	I have some Chanel loafers that I love, so I totally get it.

POLICE OFFICER	Open up, please. Right now.

KID	Why am I doing this?

BEAU	Stop asking questions.

BEAU	That’s good, that’s good.

BEAU	Oh, god dammit.

KID	What’s happening?

BEAU	Oh, god dammit.

BEAU	Inside the cover of that Bible there is an address in Santa Fe.

BEAU	I need you to get in the cab and go there.

KID	No!

BEAU	Listen, it’s better than Child Protective Services.

BEAU	You got to trust me on that one. All right, hey, look at me.

BEAU	I know I’m not the best dad in the world, all right, but I love you.

BEAU	God dammit. Hey!

BEAU	What the hell was that for?

KID	You fuck everything up!

BEAU	Hey!

OFFICERS	Get down on the ground! Get on the ground!

BEAU	Wait! No, no, no! I’m not resisting! I’m not resisting!

ERASMUS	Bang!

ERASMUS	Oh! Hello and good morning!

ERASMUS	Now, if you’ve never been invited to a Ranchero Breakfast...

ERASMUS	well, my friends, on this glorious day you are in luck.

ERASMUS	Because we are

PAUL	Are you okay?

PAUL	You’re leaning.

ERASMUS	Well, it’s a Western saddle.

ERASMUS	I can’t sit forward like the English.

ERASMUS	Cowboys sit back on their haunches up against the cantle.

ERASMUS	Oh!

PAUL	Oh, god.

THE DIRECTOR	Okay.

PAUL	Are you okay?

ERASMUS	Yeah, I think so.

PAUL	We don’t have to do the scene on horseback.

ERASMUS	I want to. It’s important.

ERASMUS	It adds to the masculinity, it adds to the grandeur.

PAUL	Well, that’s true.

ERASMUS	Are you being facetious?

DIRECTOR	Here you go.

ERASMUS	Thank you. Thank you so much.

ERASMUS	You are a gentleman, you really are.

ERASMUS	God knows they’re in short supply around here.

PAUL	Oh my god. Would you quit flirting with him?

PAUL	It makes him feel awkward. And he’s straight.

ERASMUS	No, it makes you feel awkward. And he’s gay.

PAUL	Well it makes everyone feel awkward...

PAUL	watching you act like a weird old woman.

ERASMUS	No, you’re a weird old woman.

PAUL	You want to know something?

PAUL	I could’ve worked for Rachel Ray. And she’s nice.

DIRECTOR	How about we just take it from the first line?

ERASMUS	I’d be delighted.

DIRECTOR	All right, everyone, back to one.

POLICE OFFICER	Step aside, son.

ERASMUS	This is a Basque oven paddle that I have re-purposed...

ERASMUS	as a tapas tray.

ERASMUS	I like to serve my stuffed piquillo peppers from the back of a horse.

ERASMUS	Mind you, a Vaquero Breakfast needn't be on a vast rancho.

ERASMUS	When we return...

ERASMUS	I'll show you how you can cook some of this gorgeous food...

ERASMUS	from your own little kitchen. Ciao.

ERASMUS	Dig in, amigos.

MANNY	Looks good.

ERASMUS	Oh, Manny, you old cock-hound, I didn't see you here.

PAUL	You can’t say cock-hound on basic cable.

DIRECTOR	Cut!

ERASMUS	Get rid of the terracotta pots.

ERASMUS	Yuck. Ditto the galvanized tin.

ERASMUS	Please, please...

ERASMUS	remove the ghastly bandanas from the goblets.

ERASMUS	You, young man, put your camera there pointing that way.

PAUL	Look at him. He’s like the gay Butch Cassidy. Except not butch.

ERASMUS	If only we had a producer who understood that objects...

ERASMUS	exist in a space.

ERASMUS	Wouldn’t that be wonderful?

PAUL	If only you came to production meetings...

PAUL	to communicate your ideas in advance.

PAUL	Oh, but that would cut into your rigorous drinking...

PAUL	and masturbation schedule.

TINO	Do you guys do this at home?

PAUL	Oh no, we don’t get along this well at home.

TINO	Why don’t you leave him?

PAUL	I probably will.

PAUL	But, part of me wants to stick around...

PAUL	just to watch him die.

ERASMUS	Oh, can we call a truce?

PAUL	Yes. Thank you. Finally.

ERASMUS	Finally? When have you ever called for a truce?

PAUL	You realize you’re starting an argument about a truce?

ERASMUS	I think you are manipulative and passive aggressive. 

ERASMUS	And the truce starts now.

ERASMUS	My favorite Mexicans. Me amo Mexico. 

WOMAN	So we just got back from Machu Picchu and there’s nothing there.

WOMAN	Not impressed. Not impressed.

WOMAN	It just looks like the Flintstones’ village. I’m like, this is it?

WOMAN	This is it? Not impressed.

DORIS	What do you like?

WOMAN	Zero stars.

DORIS	What do you like?

WOMAN	I like Epcot.

ERASMUS	Bobby Flay. I like him as a person.

ALEX	He’s one of my best friends.

ERASMUS	Oh, no, no, no. Don’t get me wrong.

ERASMUS	No, he’s got a wonderful face.

ERASMUS	And, marvelous chutzpah.

KATE	Are you from L.A.?

MAYOR	I’m the mayor.

KATE	Wait, what?

MAYOR	Of Santa Fe.

KATE	Oh, I love that.

PAUL	This close to the border of Syria. You can hear the gunfire.

PAUL	You can hear people screaming. Terrifying.

PAUL	But, the zatar chicken was the best I’ve ever had. Mouth-watering.

MAN	The screaming children didn’t bother the food at all?

PAUL	Apples and oranges.

DORIS	You got to eat.

MAYOR	It’s The City of Holy Faith. Santa Fe.

KATE	Oh. That’s so cool. I love that.

WOMAN #2	And I’m like hey, asshole...

WOMAN #2	the fucking Dalai Lama gave me that prayer pillow.

MAYOR	Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast...

MAYOR	to two of the finest hosts in Santa Fe.

MAYOR	What am I talking about? The world.

MAYOR	Paul, Erasmus.

ERASMUS	And if I may interrupt there, Mr. Mayor...

ERASMUS	let’s not forget all the little people.

ERASMUS	All the worker bees out there, whoever they are.

ERASMUS	The little people.

WOMAN #3	Here, here.

ALL	Cheers.

PAUL	I am with such an asshole.

PAUL	I love an asshole. So to speak.

PAUL	Cheers to that.

WOMAN	Cheers to that. Double cheers.

KATE	I just get sick of all the turquoise.

MAYOR	Yes.

KATE	Yeah.

KATE	I mean, no disrespect, you look great. Yeah.

KATE	Oh, hello. Who are you?

KATIE	Oh. Erasmus.

ERASMUS	Well, someone can’t spell my name.

ERASMUS	“Dear Erosmus, this is your grandson.”

ERASMUS	 Is your father here?

ERASMUS	Was he here? Has he gone? 

ERASMUS	What’s your name? Do you have a name?

ERASMUS	Can we get another chair, please?

TINO	Is that all you have with you?

ERASMUS	Well, we’ve got a Bible. Some cash.

ERASMUS	And a pack of cocaine.

ERASMUS	All anyone really needs in life.

ERASMUS	No clothes, I see.

NATHALIE	I called the store. They’re about to close.

ERASMUS	Oh. Oh, good.

ERASMUS	Everyone, it would appear this little chap is my grandson.

WOMAN	The truth is Sandy Koufax had a huge dong.

MAN	Really?

WOMAN	Huge dong. Legendary.

WOMAN	Legendarily huge dong.

DORIS	Is that true?

WOMAN	That is true. For a Jew.

PAUL	Excuse me.

PAUL	You have a grandson?

ERASMUS	It’s unbelievable, isn’t it? I mean, look. I’ve had no work done.

PAUL	I only found out you had a son a few years ago.

ERASMUS	He’s estranged. I told you about him.

PAUL	No, not really.

ERASMUS	Well, back in the 80’s when I was experimenting...

ERASMUS	I had a liaison with a woman...

ERASMUS	which resulted in a baby...Yuck.

ERASMUS	Which she wanted to keep.

ERASMUS	This is all very murky.

ERASMUS	I was probably off my tits on Quaaludes. Remember them?

ERASMUS	What a blast.

ERASMUS	Anyhoo, before you came along, darling...

ERASMUS	I had a son called Beau who dropped out of school...

ERASMUS	developed a drug problem.

ERASMUS	He even OD’d at my book launch n New York.

PAUL	No! How embarrassing for you.

ERASMUS	Well it was. Anna Wintour was there.

PAUL	Where’s the father?

ERASMUS	Well according to the note...

ERASMUS	he’s in jail. Yes, he’s in jail.

PAUL	So he’s moving in?

ERASMUS	Just keeping an eye on him.

PAUL	No, no. No.

PAUL	We can’t have a kid.

PAUL	We couldn’t even handle that little rat bastard Yorkshire Terrier.

PAUL	Thank god for that coyote. Problem solved.

PAUL	But a kid’s too much.

ERASMUS	Calm down.

ERASMUS	I’m sure someone from Social Services...

ERASMUS	will turn up on the doorstep and tell us where we stand.

ERASMUS	Just take one of your pills.

PAUL	Why don’t you take one of your pills?

ERASMUS	Oh, that reminds me. What are we going to do about this?

ERASMUS	I mean, I don’t do cocaine anymore...

ERASMUS	but it seems such a dreadful waste.

PAUL	We could put it in one of Tatiana’s charity auctions.

ERASMUS	Perfect.

PAUL	I’m kidding.

PAUL	We’d go to jail.

ERASMUS	Oh.

ERASMUS	Do you want a blowjob?

PAUL	We have guests.

ERASMUS	Yes, you’re right.

MALE GUEST	Have a nice night, guys. Thanks so much.

KATE	Hey, so people are going so you can deal with the kid.

MALE GUEST #2	Thanks, guys, goodnight.

ERASMUS	No, no, don’t go, Kate.

KATE	No, I have a bleaching in the morning. For my teeth.

ERASMUS	Everyone is leaving.

ERASMUS	This is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me.

NATHALIE	Just tell us what you want and someone will make it for you.

KID	I want Taco Bell.

TINO	Let’s just go to the kitchen.

KID	Don’t touch me!

MAYOR	It’s all right. That’s okay.

ERASMUS	Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

ERASMUS	Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

PAUL	Okay, you know what? Would you nut up for a second?

PAUL	Here’s what you’re going to do.

PAUL	You’re going to get the Mayor a shot of Mezcal...

PAUL	you’re going to ask the editor of Elle Décor to dance...

PAUL	I’m going to tell Gustavo to play some tangos...

PAUL	and get Tino to take that feral child to Taco Bell.

PAUL	Then you’re going to go to the front door...

PAUL	tell everybody to come back...

PAUL	because you got me a birthday cake, we’re going to sing...

PAUL	and there’s cocaine.

ERASMUS	Yes, but I haven’t and it’s not your birthday.

ERASMUS	It is your birthday.

PAUL	Go. Go, go.

ERASMUS	Hey, everyone! I’ve got cocaine and birthday cake!

ERASMUS	Well, this would be the point where you say...

ERASMUS	Erasmus, it’s marvelous!

ERASMUS	It’s like staying at a five-star resort!

KID	I look like a fucking asshole in these.

PAUL	All right, come on. Bedtime, let’s go.

PAUL	Lights on or off?

KID	I don’t care.

ERASMUS	Hey, hey, never say that.

ERASMUS	You should always care passionately...

ERASMUS	about every single choice you make in your life.

PAUL	Goodnight.

PAUL	We’re locking our doors. That kid scares the shit out of me.

ERASMUS	Oh, I think he’s sweet.

PAUL	Really?

PAUL	Well people thought Jeffrey Dahmer was sweet...

PAUL	until he raped them and ate them.

ERASMUS	I’m sure it’s just a temporary arrangement.

PAUL	What if it’s not?

ERASMUS	Would that be such a bad thing?

PAUL	My parents were such drunk-aholic messes.

PAUL	I was eleven years old before I realized my father’s name...

PAUL	wasn’t “That Fucking Bastard”.

ERASMUS	You’ve told me that joke before.

PAUL	I’m so sorry. I’ll try and work on some new material.

ERASMUS	Thank you.

PAUL	They were terrible parents. I don’t want to be a terrible parent.

ERASMUS	No one’s asking you to be.

PAUL	Oh god. I feel like I’m going to have one of my things.

ERASMUS	What things?

PAUL	My panic things.

PAUL	I shouldn’t have done blow. I’m such a douche bag.

ERASMUS	Well take one of your pills.

PAUL	I did.

ERASMUS	The editor of Elle Décor...

ERASMUS	was dancing like her life depended on it.

ERASMUS	If she had gone home early the party would have been a disaster.

PAUL	We should check in, make sure everything’s okay.

ERASMUS	What, with the editor?

PAUL	No, the kid.

ERASMUS	Oh, he’ll be fast asleep.

PAUL	We should check in. Make sure he hasn’t stolen anything.

PAUL	What the hell?

PAUL	Hey, kid? What’s his name again?

ERASMUS	I told you a dozen times, I don’t know.

PAUL	Kid?

PAUL	Should I call the police?

ERASMUS	No, it’s okay, they’re all here. They’re safe.

PAUL	No, not because of your kachina doll collection.

PAUL	Because the kid is missing.

ERASMUS	Oh.

ERASMUS	Paul.

ERASMUS	Maybe one of us should take the car into town...

ERASMUS	and have a look around.

PAUL	Meaning me?

ERASMUS	Well, one of us has got to stay here.

PAUL	Meaning you?

PAUL	Erasmus.

ERASMUS	Oh, thank god.

ERASMUS	I need a drink.

PAUL	Hey.

PAUL	Hey, hey.

PAUL	Hey. You gave us a scare, kid.

KID	Get away from me, you fag!

PAUL	So, what’d the lawyer say?

ERASMUS	Well, nothing really.

ERASMUS	Just that the father is in custody, the mother is dead.

ERASMUS	And they’re going to send someone around from social services.

PAUL	We can’t have a kid. We don’t like kids.

ERASMUS	Stop calling him a kid, he’s a child. A kid is a baby goat.

PAUL	Well I’d rather have a baby goat. Baby goats are cute.

ERASMUS	Baby goats won’t come and visit you when you’re old and lonely.

ERASMUS	Besides, didn’t you organize that Mexican children’s charity...

ERASMUS	or something?

PAUL	Oh, yeah, whatever.

PAUL	Look, I love helping children in the abstract...

PAUL	but I don’t want one in the house.

PAUL	Well, at any rate, we have to send it to school.

ERASMUS	Really?

PAUL	Yeah, it’s the law.

PAUL	And it gets him out of the house for the day.

ERASMUS	Hello.

SECRETARY	Oh, hello.

ERASMUS	We would like to enroll this young man.

SECRETARY	All right. And what is his name?

PAUL	Would you excuse us, please?

ERASMUS	Oh. I see you’ve discovered one of my favorite contraptions.

ERASMUS	These are such fun. Let’s have a look.

ERASMUS	You might want to vary your expression a bit.

ERASMUS	Scoot along. And join in with me, if you like.

ERASMUS	I like to do one happy.

ERASMUS	One angry.

ERASMUS	One silly.

ERASMUS	And one, just looking off into the middle distance...

ERASMUS	thinking about something.

ERASMUS	A bit of an awkward wait.

ERASMUS	Oh, look at those. We’re hilarious.

ERASMUS	What would you like to do now?

CHECKOUT GIRL	Having a party?

ERASMUS	No.

ERASMUS	And where have you been?

PAUL	In the editing room. Trying to make something viable...

PAUL	out of your insane on-camera ramblings.

ERASMUS	Paul, do you know that huge store...

ERASMUS	called Waymart or Mallmart or something, on Cerrillos?

PAUL	Yeah, of course. It’s owned by some crazy conservatives.

PAUL	You shouldn’t shop there.

ERASMUS	I thought it was Nirvana.

ERASMUS	Everything was so inexpensive. The effect was intoxicating.

PAUL	As intoxicating as that giant tumbler of tequila?

ERASMUS	Yes. But in a different way.

PAUL	He should be in bed.

ERASMUS	Why?

PAUL	Because it’s two in the morning.

ERASMUS	He doesn’t have school in the morning.

PAUL	I know. Because we haven’t enrolled him.

PAUL	Because we don’t know his name.

ERASMUS	Have a tequila.

PAUL	I’m so tired.

ERASMUS	I’m so tired.

PAUL	Hey, kid, I know you’re having fun, but it’s very late.

PAUL	Why don’t you turn off the TV? Let’s get you to bed.

PAUL	Thanks, buddy.

ERASMUS	Manana, piranha.

ERASMUS	Are you mad at me?

ERASMUS	Paul?

ERASMUS	Getting a nightcap?

PAUL	Some tea.

ERASMUS	Did you see the photo for the dust jacket?

PAUL	Yes I did.

ERASMUS	What do you think?

PAUL	This is why you need me.

PAUL	You really, really should have let me look over these...

PAUL	before you chose the cover.

PAUL	Because you look like a person with a mental handicap.

PAUL	No creature smiles this hardin all of nature.
 
ERASMUS	I do.

ERASMUS	When you make me laugh.

PAUL	Oh!

ERASMUS	That was cruel.

ERASMUS	The kettle’s boiling. So to speak.

PAUL	Fuck the tea.

ERASMUS	Yay.

ERASMUS	Well, hello.

BEAU	I assume that the kid got to you okay?

ERASMUS	Yes, yes, he’s here with me now.

BEAU	What? You brought him here?

ERASMUS	Yes, of course. He wants to see you.

BEAU	What, are you insane? He can’t see me like this.

ERASMUS	Don’t be ridiculous.

PAUL	Want a Rolo?

PAUL	That’s littering.

KID	So?

PAUL	So, we don’t do that. Pick it up.

PAUL	Pick it up.

BEAU	Don’t bring him back here, it’s going to screw him up in the head.

ERASMUS	Like every decision you have made already hasn’t screwed him up.

BEAU	Hey, I don’t need any shit from you.

ERASMUS	You’re going to take it, young man.

ERASMUS	Because Paul and I are looking after your child.

BEAU	Who’s Paul?
 
ERASMUS	Paul is my male companion and he has been for the last 10 years.

ERASMUS	Do you have a problem with that?

BEAU	No. 

ERASMUS	Oh. Well, anyway...

ERASMUS	we brought him here so that you could see each other...

ERASMUS	and to reassure you that he’s being well taken care of in your absence.

ERASMUS	You’re welcome.

BEAU	What would I thank you for? Where were you when I was 10 years old?

BEAU	I could have used you then.

BEAU	And now you come back here with your scarf around your neck...

BEAU	and think you’re saving the day?

ERASMUS	It’s called a kerchief.

BEAU	Look, you’re not the hero of me and my son’s story, all right?

BEAU	You’re a last resort.

ERASMUS	Wait! What’s his name?

BEAU	I wrote it in the Bible.

ERASMUS	Wait, what?

ERASMUS	So, it turns out the county won’t allow visits from children today.

PAUL	But the lady out front said

ERASMUS	Without additional paperwork.

PAUL	Oh.

PAUL	I have a great idea.

PAUL	Why don’t we go to a video arcade and then get some ice cream?

ERASMUS	Yeah. Or...

ERASMUS	we could go to the Georgia O’Keefe Museum...

ERASMUS	and afterwards have a nice salad.

PAUL	Die, fucker!

KID	Yes! Yes! Yes!

KID	You saw that, didn’t you?

PAUL	Nice shot, nice shot!

ERASMUS	Excuse me, sweetheart...

ERASMUS	we don’t fold throws, it’s too fussy.

ERASMUS	We want it to be more casual, so we drape it like a woman reclining...

ERASMUS	thus.

PAUL	Yes, you mustn’t make it seem...

PAUL	as if you put too much thought into it.

ERASMUS	Exactly so. It shouldn’t look like it’s been placed there...

ERASMUS/PAUL	it should look like it’s just appeared.

ERASMUS	Yes, like a rainbow.

DECORATOR	Cyst.

ERASMUS	Or a wildflower.

DECORATOR	Cancer cell.

PAUL	Perfect.

DECORATOR	That’s wrong.

PAUL	Excuse us. Erasmus.

PAUL	Look, the Bible.

PAUL	From Beau, remember? He said he left a note.

ERASMUS	Oh. Yeah, sorry. I thought you’d found God.

ERASMUS	“It’s Beau. Remember me? This is grandson. Mother is dead.”

ERASMUS	“I got trouble/jail. Take care of him. He’s Angel.”

PAUL	He’s really got something against articles of speech.

ERASMUS	Angel.

PAUL	Is your name Angel?

ERASMUS	Why didn’t you tell us?

KID	I don’t like it.

PAUL	No one likes their name.

ERASMUS	No. Can you imagine how I felt on my first day at school...

ERASMUS	when the teacher called out Erasmus Dickie Brumble?

PAUL	What’s wrong with Angel?

KID	It’s gay.

PAUL	It is a little gay.

ERASMUS	What would you like to be called?

KID	Bill. 

ERASMUS	Then Bill you shall be.

PAUL	Well, you can’t just change his name ‘cause he wants to change it.

ERASMUS	Why not?

PAUL	Yeah, why not?

PAUL	All right, fine. Bill it is. But one question.

PAUL	Why didn’t you just tell us you wanted to be called Bill...

PAUL	from the outset?

KID	Because I just thought of it.  I’ve been trying to think of a name.

ERASMUS	What difference does it make?

PAUL	It makes a difference because for two weeks...

PAUL	we’ve been calling him Kid and we haven’t put him in school.

PAUL	No problem. Just, from now on, communicate.

ERASMUS	Yeah, communicate.

PAUL	 Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t!

PAUL	Don’t do that! All the fucking time you do that!

PAUL	You make me look like an idiot in front of the crew, in front of the kid!

ERASMUS	The kid’s got a name!

ERASMUS	He’s called

KID	I’m sorry, what was your name?

PAUL	It’s Bill!

CREW MEMBER	Paul?  Paul, wait, we need you.

ERASMUS	Well, can you make an exception in my case?

ERASMUS	Perhaps it would make a difference if I were to tell you my name...

ERASMUS	is Erasmus Brumble.

ERASMUS	I present a cookery program and- Oh, sod it.

ERASMUS	Taco Bell don’t deliver and I can’t get a hold of Paul.

ERASMUS	Hello, Paul. It’s me.

ERASMUS	You made your point, quite eloquently. Please come home.

ERASMUS	I have made you cochinita pibil...

ERASMUS	with homemade tortilla. I’ve offered to make you anything...

ERASMUS	from the finest ingredients known to man.

KID	Taco Bell.

ERASMUS	Fine. All right.

ERASMUS	Total capitulation.

ERASMUS	Shit.  This is raccoon.

KID	It’s by the building that’s brown and it’s square...

KID	and it has these little logs on the roof.

ERASMUS	In case you hadn’t noticed...

ERASMUS	you just described every fucking building in Santa Fe.

KID	Wait, there it is!

ERASMUS	Oh, great.

KID	We finally made it to Taco Bell. We finally made it.

KID	Come on, come on, come on! Let’s go inside.

LETICIA	Hi, welcome to Taco Bell. My name is Leticia. How can I help you?

ERASMUS	Hello, Leticia.

ERASMUS	My name is Erasmus and this is my grandson, Bill.

KID	Can I have the Crunchwrap Supreme with bacon...

KID	and the Nachos BellGrande?

LETICIA	Sure. And for you, sir?

ERASMUS	I am mesmerized...

ERASMUS	by the divergent culinary concepts at play here.

ERASMUS	Cheesy Gordita Crunch.

ERASMUS	Fiery Doritos Locos Tacos Supreme.

ERASMUS	I mean, it’s like Mexican jazz music.

MANAGER	Are you Erasmus Brumble?

ERASMUS	I am, indeed.

MANAGER	I heard that you called earlier.

MANAGER	I love your books and your TV show.

MANAGER	What are you doing here?

ERASMUS	Well if you like my books and my TV show, what are you doing here?

MANAGER	Oh, are you going to order something?

ERASMUS	I’d love to see the wine list first, please.

KID	He wasn’t joking.

KID	Do you like it?

ERASMUS	Oh, Bill, I’ve seen the light.

KID	What?

ERASMUS	Well, have a think.

ERASMUS	What’s the happiest you’ve ever been?

KID	One time with my dad...

KID	he took me to the mountains and we shot squirrels.

ERASMUS	Well, for me...

ERASMUS	sitting here sharing this taco with you...

ERASMUS	is that good.

ERASMUS	But there’s got to be a better table than this.

ERASMUS	How long have you been sitting alone here in the dark?

PAUL	10 years.

ERASMUS	It has been a nightmare since you’ve been away.

ERASMUS	Bill and I have been crying our eyes out. Isn’t that right, Bill?

KID	No. It was fine. We went to Taco Bell.

ERASMUS	Okay, why don’t you trot off to bed, little man?

PAUL	We can’t have a kid. We are kids.

ERASMUS	Well, that’s not true.

PAUL	You’re more of a kid than me.

ERASMUS	Do I have a sense of play? Oo, yeah!

ERASMUS	But you’re a man.

ERASMUS	You’re a great big hulking Paleolithic beast of a man.

PAUL	You’re talking about my ass.

ERASMUS	No. Look at me.

ERASMUS	You have the biggest heart of any man I know.

KID	Is everything all right?

ERASMUS	Yes, everything is fine.

KID	Can I have Chunky Monkey?

ERASMUS	Yes, of course.

KID	Where is it?

ERASMUS	It’s in the freezer in the kitchen.

KID	There isn’t any there, I looked.

PAUL	No, it’s in the freezer in the garage. It’s in the garage.

PAUL	The one with all the Kevin Costner magnets on it.

KID	Who’s Kevin Costner?

ERASMUS	He was in that film

ERASMUS	What was it called?

PAUL	It doesn’t matter.

PAUL	It doesn’t matter. It’s in the only freezer that’s in the garage.

KID	Okay.

ERASMUS	Goodnight.

KID	Do you want some?

ERASMUS/PAUL	No thank you.

KID	Okay.

ERASMUS	Oh! “Dances With Wolves”!

PAUL	We got to make him lunch.

PAUL	We have to make him lunch.

PAUL	We have to make him lunch.

KID	Taco Bell.

PAUL	Pepperoni pizza.

KID	No.

PAUL	Come on, man, look. It’s got tongue twisters...

PAUL	jokes and more mixed-up fun inside.

KID	No.

PAUL	Oh, god.

PAUL	All right, last offer.

PAUL	A two-pound bag of Sour Patch Kids for lunch.

KID	Candy is for dessert.

PAUL	It’s got all the flavors. Blue.

KID	Please?

LETICIA	We’re still serving breakfast.

PAUL	For how long?

LETICIA	Another 45 minutes.

PAUL	Oh, fuck you.

KID	Has it been 45 minutes yet?

PAUL	No, it’s been two.

PAUL	I want 20 Crunchwraps with bacon, please.

LETICIA	20?

PAUL	20.

KID	Why’d you get 20 of ‘em?

PAUL	I’m going to freeze them...

PAUL	and then thaw them out every morning.

KID	That’s not going to work.

KID	And it’s weird.

KID	Why can’t I just take ‘em to school in the Taco Bell bag?

PAUL	Because I have written articles for Saveur Magazine.

PAUL	Do you know what that is?

KID	No.

PAUL	Get the fuck out of my car.

PAUL	So the bartender says “No, you don’t know?”

PAUL	You walk him and pitch to the rhino.

PAUL	Why are you wearing chaps at dinner?

ERASMUS	These used to belong to Roy Rogers.

PAUL	Please.

ERASMUS	Even though I don’t believe in reincarnation...

ERASMUS	I am becoming more and more convinced that in a previous life...

ERASMUS	I was a cattle rustler.

PAUL	You just said you don’t believe in reincarnation.

ERASMUS	I can rustle cattle. I roped a steer.

PAUL	You couldn’t rope Ethel Merman.

DREW	So Bill, do you like the place?

TINO	Seriously, tell them what time you got to bed.

KID	Whenever I want.

DREW	Oh. 

DREW	I want Erasmus and Paul to be my granddaddies.

MARK	Do you like Erasmus’s cooking?

KID	No. It’s gross.

MARK	Where’s your dad?

KID	He’s in jail for beating up a hooker.

DREW	Where do you get this stuff?

PAUL	He’s actually not kidding about that.

DREW	Oh.

DREW	Well, where’s your mom?

KID	She was a drug addict...

KID	and she took too many drugs one night...

KID	and she fell off a balcony...

KID	and it was four stories high.

PAUL	Where were you when this happened?

KID	In the next room.

ERASMUS	Well, the good news is I’ve made a pear tart.

MELISSA	Hi.

MELISSA	I’m Melissa Enright with Child Protective Services.

PAUL	Hi! Hey! Come on in.

MELISSA	Thank you.

MELISSA	Well this is the first of several mandated visits...

MELISSA	by the CPS of New Mexico.

PAUL	Fantastic.

MELISSA	When a single parent is arrested there’s an inquiry initiated by CPS.

PAUL	He’s been here for 10 weeks.

MELISSA	We’re back-logged.

MELISSA	So, is he here, or?

ERASMUS	Who’s that?

PAUL	Erasmus, this is...

MELISSA	Melissa.

PAUL	Melissa...

PAUL	from Child Protective Services.

ERASMUS	Oh, shit. Hello, Melissa, I’m Erasmus.

PAUL	So, yeah, Bill’s around. You haven’t seen-

PAUL	Did Tino clean up from last night?

ERASMUS	I don’t know, I just got up.

MELISSA	Is anything wrong?

ERASMUS	No, Melissa.

ERASMUS	Welcome to our humble country abode.

ERASMUS	I’m just going to put some coffee on.

PAUL	Oo, sounds good, coffee.

MELISSA	It’s also good if we find the child.

PAUL	Oh, here he is, right where we sometimes find him.

MELISSA	Hello.

PAUL	Oh, yeah, he likes to be called Bill.

KID	So they take me to school every morning...

KID	and then they pick me up every afternoon.

MELISSA	Together? They both go?

KID	It’s usually Paul.

KID	No, it’s always Paul.

MELISSA	Has anything happened here at home...

MELISSA	that frightened or disturbed you?

KID	No.

MELISSA	Are you sure?

KID	Like what?

MELISSA	Like any hitting or yelling.

KID	Not really.

MELISSA	Not really? You’re not sure?

KID	I mean no.

MELISSA	Have you seen anything that confused you?

MELISSA	Certain kinds of touching that made you uncomfortable?

KID	No.

MELISSA	It seems like something happened...

MELISSA	that you don’t want to talk to me about.

MELISSA	But you can tell me anything.

KID	Can I just show you?

MELISSA	Of course.

ERASMUS	Those flat shoes. Flap, flap, flap, flap, flap, flap, flap, flap, flap.

PAUL	They’re so flat it actually makes her shorter.

ERASMUS	It’s not even an inch. It’s completely flat.

ERASMUS	Everything all right?

MELISSA	Totally fine. What a large room.

PAUL	What the hell does that mean?

ERASMUS	I hate her.

MELISSA	Excuse me.

MELISSA	Would both of you come this way, please?

PAUL	Do you think she heard us calling her a dumb bitch?

ERASMUS	I hope she hasn’t found the porn.

MELISSA	Yeah, I mean, most of the places I go are really horrific...

MELISSA	so when I saw this house I was like, lucky kid.

MELISSA	But you can’t give a kid porno.

ERASMUS	Yes.

ERASMUS	The thing is, they are all Paul’s.

PAUL	What? No they’re not.

PAUL	Some of them. You know, we keep this locked up.

MELISSA	The thing about a lock is, it has no meaning if there’s a key in it.

PAUL	Is that Confucius? No, it’s true.

KID	I was just trying to find E.T.

ERASMUS	Hey.

PAUL	Bill.

ERASMUS	E.T. Classic Spielberg.

ERASMUS	Weaver of dreams.

MELISSA	I love when his finger lights up.

ERASMUS	That’s how you can tell he’s an alien.

PAUL	And his face.

MELISSA	And his face.

MELISSA	Bill, would you give us a moment?

MELISSA	Sex Wars: Phantom Ass.

ERASMUS	Just a phase he was going through.

PAUL	Yeah, I’m kind of a Star Wars guy.

MELISSA	Bareback Mountain.

ERASMUS	What they do is take a recognized title...

ERASMUS	and just give it a bit of a cheeky twist.

MELISSA	I get it.

ERASMUS	That’s unusual in that the source material is also... gay.

PAUL	Butt Pluggerz. We’re throwing them all out.

PAUL	There’s so much online. What did I just say?

MELISSA	Is it okay if I come back?

PAUL	Yes, any time.

MELISSA	Great. Good. Because I will be back.

ERASMUS	We long for you to return. Late mornings generally are best.

MELISSA	One last thing.

MELISSA	It really feels like you should be cooking something nutritious...

MELISSA	for Bill at home and not just grabbing fast food.

MELISSA	Especially given your line of work.

ERASMUS	It’s not me, it’s him!

PAUL	That’s great advice. Thank you so much for that input.

MELISSA	Have a good day.

ERASMUS	What a queer fish.

PAUL	Yeah!

MS. GARCIA	Does he have friends outside of school?

ERASMUS	Two of us, household employees, staff.

MS. GARCIA	Anyone his age?

ERASMUS	Well, there’s Tino.

MS. GARCIA	Oh, good, Tino. How old is Tino?

ERASMUS/PAUL	24.

PAUL	No, he doesn’t, really.

MS. GARCIA	I would like to refer you to a developmental therapist...

MS. GARCIA	here in Santa Fe.

ERASMUS	Are you saying he’s insane?

MS. GARCIA	No, no, no. Of course not.

MS. GARCIA	But treatment can benefit someone...

MS. GARCIA	who’s been living with an unstable personality.

PAUL	Maybe I should get some treatment.

MS. GARCIA	Of course, if you feel that you

ERASMUS	He’s joking.

PAUL	No I’m not.

ERASMUS	In any event, I have a very important...

ERASMUS	harvest abundance episode of my television program to record.

ERASMUS	So, if you have nothing further to say, I’ll take my leave.

ERASMUS	And if you could find the time...

ERASMUS	to teach him how to spell, add, and subtract, that would suffice.

PAUL	Un-fucking-believable.

ERASMUS	She’s just trying to do her job, Paul.

PAUL	Not her, you, you dumb dick.

ERASMUS	What?

PAUL	He should be making friends.

PAUL	My god, after everything he’s been through--

ERASMUS	What concern is it of yours?

PAUL	Excuse me?

ERASMUS	Well you’ve expressed how little interest you have in him.

PAUL	And I pick him up from school every day.

ERASMUS	And I appreciate your efforts, but you’ve made it abundantly clear...

ERASMUS	you don’t want to be saddled with the responsibility.

PAUL	Well I am saddled with the responsibility.

PAUL	When he first arrived I thought, oh...

PAUL	I don’t know how we’re going to handle all the--

ERASMUS	Paul. Can you make a mental note of all this...

ERASMUS	and we can sort it out over a smart cocktail at sunset?

PAUL	I have something at stake here.

ERASMUS	What?

PAUL	When he got here I thought, oh great, you know what...

PAUL	I’m going to be stuck with all the responsibility. And surprise!

PAUL	I am stuck with it! But I will not wake up early every day...

PAUL	wake him up, pack his lunch, help him with his homework...

PAUL	Yeah. By the way, he has homework.

PAUL	and have you tell me it has nothing to do with me!

PAUL	Oh, you know what, I am so sick of being this furious.

PAUL	I give up.

PAUL	What am I doing?

PAUL	You have to tape, I have to stay here and pick him up.

ERASMUS	No, Tino can pick him up.

PAUL	I’ll pick him up.

ERASMUS	Don’t be a martyr.

PAUL	Oh... This...

PAUL	This I never imagined for myself. I went to Wesleyan.

PAUL	My contemporaries are scions of industry.

PAUL	I should be living in New York running the Food Network.

PAUL	Not sitting here in this dusty pueblo...

PAUL	babysitting the boy from The Shining.

ERASMUS	Yeah, and I went to Oxford and all my friends--

PAUL	You went to a cooking school in the town of Oxford.

ERASMUS	What’s your point?

PAUL	It’s a very different thing.

ERASMUS	What’s your point?

PAUL	My friends at the Rachel Ray show called me again...

PAUL	and told me there’s still a job there for me if I want it.

ERASMUS	Idle threat.

SCHOOL KIDS	Wait up!

ERASMUS	Wait. What do we do best?

PAUL	Drink and argue.

ERASMUS	Throw parties. We just need to give Bill a proper birthday.

PAUL	It’s his birthday?

ERASMUS	It doesn’t matter.

ERASMUS	But we do need to freshen up the genre. We need a theme.

ERASMUS	Something stunning.

PAUL	I thought we were in the middle of a fight.

ERASMUS	What?

ERASMUS	Forget Pin The Tail On The Donkey. Try pinning the tail on Ganesh...

ERASMUS	the elephant-headed Hindu deity at your next children’s party.

ERASMUS	I’m going to take you on a tour of the Indian subcontinent...

ERASMUS	where we’re going to discover the secrets of tandoori lobster dogs...

ERASMUS	saffron cupcakes and tamarind ice cream.

ERASMUS	This is your Passage to India!

ERASMUS	I’m Erasmus Brumble and this is Ideal Home!

ERASMUS	One of the staples of authentic Indian cuisine...

ERASMUS	is, of course, Naan, the indigenous flatbread.

ERASMUS	But I need someone to help me roll the dough.

ERASMUS	Heather, how about you?

WHITNEY	My name’s not Heather...

WHITNEY	it’s Whitney.

ERASMUS	That’s all right.

ERASMUS	Bill, would you like to help me grind some tamarind paste...

ERASMUS	with this pestle and mortar?

KID	No. Let’s get Taco Bell.

KIDS	Yeah! Taco Bell!

ERASMUS	Cut!

PAUL/KIDS	Taco Bell! Taco Bell! Taco Bell! Taco Bell!

KID’S FRIEND	Hey.

KID	What?

KID’S FRIEND	Is this your party?

KID	Yeah.

KID’S FRIEND	Do you have two dads?

KID	No. Well, I don’t know. Sort of.

KID	That’s littering.

KID	So what?

KID	We don’t do that here.

LITTLE GIRL	Wow!

MOTHER	Oh my gosh, this has been so amazing.

MOTHER	Chelsea’s got a birthday next weekend...

MOTHER	and we would so love to have you guys come.

PAUL	Fantastic.

PAUL	Yeah?

ERASMUS	Try and keep us away.

SUBURBAN DAD	So, the Spurs need to stick to what they do best. Work as a team.

SUBURBAN DAD	I mean, you got Genobli, you got Duncan. Small ball.

SUBURBAN DAD	Thanks, honey.

ERASMUS	I don’t really know who those people are.

PAUL	I don’t even know what sport you’re talking about.

ERASMUS	I think it’s baseball. Is it?

PAUL	That’s the one with the small ball.

ERASMUS	I know that.

ERASMUS	We’re not really sporty types.

PAUL	Yeah.

SOUNDTRACK	Everybody dance now

SUBURBAN DAD	Holy shit! I got my first blowy when this song was playing.

SUBURBAN DAD	She was...

SUBURBAN DAD	She was...

PAUL	A girl?

SUBURBAN DAD	Yeah.

ERASMUS	Did she have big ol’ tits?

MOTHER	We just got the couch.

MOTHER	You can have ice in there, you can have beer in there...

MOTHER	you can sit back, relax.

PAUL	Functional, stylish, comfy. What more could you ask for?

MOTHER	It’s not like on your TV show, but...

ERASMUS	Oh, no, but, I mean...

ERASMUS	everyone’s different.

PAUL	Look, the world would be a pretty dull place if we were all the same.

ERASMUS	Here, here.

MOTHER	Right?

MOTHER	Oh my god, I’m sorry. Would you rather have white wine?

ERASMUS/PAUL	Yeah.

MOTHER	Yeah? Okay.

PAUL	Well, you know what, they seem like a nice family. They seem happy.

ERASMUS	Yeah, well, I’d rather be all fucked up and live in a nice house.

PAUL	Well then dreams really do come true.

ERASMUS	And that song as invaded my mind.

PAUL	Oh, that fucking song.

KID’S CLASSMATES	All right, bye.

BIL	See you tomorrow, Bill.

PAUL	Bye.

PAUL	Well, they seem like nice boys. What are their names?

KID	One is named Lantham,  Latham... Latham.

KID	And the other’s name’s...I don’t know.

PAUL	Okay. Well, here, I had to park on the other block.

PAUL	It was a little crowded.

PAUL	Idiot!

PAUL	Not you, him. Are you all right?

KID	Yeah.

PAUL	Why don’t you hold my hand from now on?

KID	No.

PAUL	Bill, take my hand.

KID	I don’t want to.

PAUL	You were almost killed.

KID	I don’t care!

PAUL	I do! I’m the adult, you’re the child and you’re going to do as I say!

KID	Fuck you!

KID	What’s the matter?

PAUL	I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.

PAUL	I can’t breathe.

PAUL	I need an ambulance.

PARAMEDIC	Are you having chest pain now?

PAUL	Yeah.

KID	Are you going to be okay?

PAUL	I don’t know.

PARAMEDIC	Your blood pressure is a little high...

PARAMEDIC	but I don’t see anything else.

PARAMEDIC	Have you ever had a panic attack?

PARAMEDIC	Do you have any history of anxiety or panic attacks?

PAUL	I do.

PAUL	I think I’m having a heart attack...

PAUL	and then it turns out to be anxiety.

PARAMEDIC	So you’ve called an ambulance before?

PAUL	Yeah.

PARAMEDIC	How many times?

PAUL	Uh, nine times. About nine times.

PARAMEDIC	Yep.

ERASMUS	But you saved his life.

ERASMUS	You get a coupon for redemption...

ERASMUS	when you arrive at the gates of heaven.

PAUL	It was so disturbing, watching the kid almost get killed.

PAUL	And then the screaming match. And then I had one of my things.

ERASMUS	What things?

PAUL	My panic things.

ERASMUS	You didn’t call an ambulance.

ERASMUS	Oh, no.

PAUL	It was humiliating. We didn’t even make it to the hospital.

PAUL	The EMT just told me to take it easy.

ERASMUS	And death is cheated once more.

ERASMUS	Away, you shadowy specter.

PAUL	Where are my pills?

ERASMUS	Hey, hey. Just, have a tequila and think pleasant thoughts.

PAUL	Oh god, I can’t.

PAUL	Every night my dreams end in the apocalypse...

PAUL	alien invasions and mega-tsunamis.

ERASMUS	Oh, your dreams are so big-budget.

ERASMUS	I just dream I’m naked and people are laughing at me.

PAUL	I dream that, too.

ERASMUS	Eventually...

ERASMUS	you just have to make a decision to be happy.

PAUL	Never do that voice again.

PAUL	Rise and shine.

PAUL	Come on, kiddo. Time to get up.

PAUL	School. Did you finish your book report?

KID	Yes.

PAUL	You want to tell me what my anxiety medication...

PAUL	is doing in your backpack?

ERASMUS	Have you taken any of these?

KID	No.

PAUL	Well where are they? The entire bottle is missing.

KID	I don’t have them.

ERASMUS	What have you done with them?

ERASMUS	Out with it, young man. This is serious.

KID	I sold them to this kid in the middle school.

ERASMUS	Thank god for that.

PAU	Thank god?

ERASMUS	Well at least he hasn’t taken them himself.

PAUL	Where would you get an idea to do something like that?

ERASMUS	His father.

PAUL	What?

ERASMUS	His father. Your father.

PAUL	Oh, well, yeah. Yeah, okay.

ERASMUS	Why did you feel the need to do this?

KID	I needed money.

PAUL	For what?

PAUL	 Don’t we buy you everything you could ask for?

KID	I need money in case.

ERASMUS	In case what?

KID	In case I’m not here.

KID	In case that Melissa lady takes me, or something.

PAUL	Listen to me.

PAUL	You’re not going anywhere, okay?

PAUL	I won’t let it happen. We won’t let it happen.

PAUL	Look at me. We promise.

PAUL	Do you understand?

PAUL	And if you promise not to deal drugs...

PAUL	we’ll give you $100 a week.

ERASMUS	Wait, no. $50.

KID	Okay.

KID	I’ll do it for $100.

ERASMUS	Okay.

PAUL	Okay. Great. Great.

ERASMUS	Yay!

KID	All right! High-fives all around!

ERASMUS	Good job.

KID	Crisis averted. Bring it.

PAUL	We did it.

CHEERING	Yay!

PAUL	Oh yeah. Good.

ERASMUS	And then a funny face.

PAUL	Come on, Bill!

KID	Hey, no!

PAUL	Come on!

KID	No, no, no more! Stop it!

SYMPHONY	In conclusion, my parents have taught me about recycling...

SYMPHONY	because they love me and they love the Earth. The end.

MS. GARCIA	All right.

MS. GARCIA	Thank you, Symphony.

MS. GARCIA	And next is Bill.

KID	I live with Paul and Erasmus.

MS. GARCIA	Bill, remember, look your audience in the eye, okay?

MS. GARCIA	And let’s try it a little louder.

KID	I live with Paul and Erasmus.

KID	They are not my dads but they do all the stuff dads do.

KID	They are gay. In the olden days it was illegal to be gay.

KID	There are some words you should never use...

KID	when you are talking to someone who is gay.

KID	Never say faggot.

KID	Never say cocksucker.

MS. GARCIA	Bill!

KID	And never, ever, ever say...

MS. GARCIA	Bill, please stop. No.

KID	butt-fucking.

ERASMUS READING	“In the olden days it was illegal to be gay.” Indeed it was.

ERASMUS	“There are some words you should never say to someone who is gay.”

ERASMUS	“Never say faggot. Never say cocksucker.”

MS. GARCIA	Unfortunately, the school district...

MS. GARCIA	doesn’t find quite the same sense of humor in this situation.

PAUL	He said this aloud in class?

MS. GARCIA	Up to, and including, that word.

ERASMUS	Did he say “butt-fucking?”

ERASMUS	“Never, ever say butt-fucking.”

MS GARCIA	Gentlemen.

MS. GARCIA	Where do you think he’s learning these terms?

ERASMUS	We don’t make a habit of using words like that, I have to say.

ERASMUS	Unless it’s in context.

MS. GARCIA	II see where he gets it.

ERASMUS	I hate to say this, but don’t you think this a case...

ERASMUS	of the pot calling the kettle black? I did notice the word “felching”...

ERASMUS	on your classroom wall...

ERASMUS	which I thought was highly inappropriate in a classroom.

MS. GARCIA	That is “felting”.

PAUL	Oh.

PAUL	Yeah. That makes more sense.

PAUL	Felching isn’t even until middle school.

ERASMUS	I am so not into that. I can’t speak for him.

PAUL	Guilty as charged.

MS. GARCIA	This is serious.

ERASMUS	Hello? Oh, yes.

ERASMUS	We were wondering when we were going to hear from you.

BEAU	How’s it going, Angel? How you doin’?

ERASMUS	Tell him how you’re doing, Bill.

KID	Good.

PAUL	He likes to be called Bill.

BEAU	Bill? 

BEAU	Is that right? Well...

BEAU	angels were one of your mom’s favorite things.

BEAU	That’s why we named you Angel.

ERASMUS	That’s still his name, legally, of course.

ERASMUS	But he’s been doing great at school. A whole spate of friends.

ERASMUS	Would you like to tell your father...

ERASMUS	about your new friends, young man?

KID	No.

BEAU	Well it sounds like you’re doing really good.

BEAU	And, I’ve been doing really good in here.

BEAU	I’ve been going to church.

BEAU	I feel a lot better now. I’m so clear-headed. The big news is...

BEAU	the minister’s really gone all out for me to get an early release...

BEAU	so I’m going to be out of here before New Year’s.

ERASMUS	Bravo.

BEAU	And the church has also set me up with a sponsor in Arizona.

BEAU	So when I do get out of here...

BEAU	me and Angel are going to go to Arizona...

BEAU	and we’re going to start working for a ministry there.

ERASMUS	Arizona.

BEAU	Yeah, that’s right.

ERASMUS	I think, we need to consider...

ERASMUS	how the boy has settled in at school here in Santa Fe.

PAUL	He has a lot of friends.

BEAU	There’s a school at the church, he’ll make new friends.

ERASMUS	Well, I think we need to consider all this very carefully.

BEAU	He’s my boy. I thank you both for taking care of him.

BEAU	But there is a plan in place and it’s a good plan.

KID	What if I want to stay?

ERASMUS	All is well and all will be well.

KID	But do I have to go?

ERASMUS	Okay, look.

ERASMUS	If I tell you something, will you promise to remember it...

ERASMUS	for as long as you can?

KID	Yeah.

ERASMUS	Everything is temporary.

PAUL	Except herpes.

KID	What’s herpes?

ERASMUS	Paul.

ERASMUS	I’m not trying to arrange permanent custody...

ERASMUS	I’m just trying to see if I can somehow...

ERASMUS	delay the child going to him.

ERASMUS	He finally has some stability, it must count for something.

LAWYER	Well, there just isn’t a court in the country...

LAWYER	that is going to separate a child from its parent, there just isn’t.

LAWYER	Unless the child is in some kind of quantifiable danger...

LAWYER	I’m sorry, Erasmus, you really don’t have any leverage.

ERASMUS	Well thank you for what has effectively been a $400 phone call...

ERASMUS	for you to say no. Piss off.

ERASMUS	Assholes! The lot of them!

PAUL	 We should probably watch our language here.

ERASMUS	Why?

PAUL	Because it’s a fucking church.

ERASMUS	I’m just trying to get that boy away from his idiotic father.

PAUL	Well, you might not get that. You might not get what you want.

ERASMUS	Why not, Paul?

PAUL	Because God hates you.

PAUL	Look, we have him through the holidays.

PAUL	Now come on. Let’s put on a show.

ERASMUS	I was going to say that.

PAUL	I know.

ERASMUS	In Mexico, and many Latin American countries...

ERASMUS	Christmas Eve is celebrated even more than the day itself.

ERASMUS	In my home, I like to prepare a flavorful Mexican supper...

ERASMUS	of freshly made green corn tamales, whole roast pig...

ERASMUS	and bunuelos con cajeta for dessert.

ERASMUS	Afterwards, we’ll attend a traditional pageant known as “Las Posadas”...

ERASMUS	which retells the story of Mary and Joseph looking for shelter...

ERASMUS	in Bethlehem.

ERASMUS	Then, we cross the Atlantic for a proper English dinner.

ERASMUS	There? Or there?

PAUL	No, further out.

PAUL	Oo, look at you!

ERASMUS	Oh, how handsome.

KID	Oh, so handsome.

PAUL	Fantastic. All right, here’s the deal.

PAUL	We’re going to go to dinner and you’re allowed to take one present.

KID	Well, how about three?

ERASMUS	Oh, okay.

KID	Okay.

PAUL	Yeah?

KID	OMG.

PAUL	Do we have more?

ERASMUS	Oh, sure.

KID	Wow.

CHILDREN	Posada

CHILDREN	A estos peregrines?

CHILDREN	Que vienen cansados

ERASMUS	Okay, cue the halo.

CHILDREN	Caminos?

ERASMUS	And heavenly glow.

CHILDREN	El nombre...

CHILDREN	del cielo

CHILDREN	Os pido posada,

CHILDREN	Pues no puede andar

CHILDREN	Mi esposo amada.

CHILDREN	Aqui no es meson

ERASMUS	Oh, this is the Land of Enchantment.

PAUL	So nice.

ERASMUS	They let you out.

BEAU	Yeah, Merry Christmas.

ERASMUS	Merry Christmas.

BEAU	Hey, bud.

BEAU	Come on. You want to come over here and give me a hug?

BEAU	How are you doing? You okay?

ERASMUS	This is absurd!

BEAU	No, this is just the way it is!

BEAU	This was never supposed to be permanent!

ERASMUS	Why are you doing this? Why? Are you trying to infuriate me?

ERASMUS	Are you trying to cause as much anguish as you possibly can?

BEAU	Oh stop it! The world doesn’t spin around you!

ERASMUS	No, it spins around the boy! You’re trying to yank him away...

ERASMUS	from the one decent Christmas he’s ever had...

ERASMUS	in the middle of the fucking night!

BEAU	Yeah, that’s what this is all about, isn’t it!

BEAU	Some big spectacle! Do you know that presents...

BEAU	and all the decorations in the world, that doesn’t make Christmas.

ERASMUS	For a little boy it does.

BEAU	No, family makes Christmas. And I am his father.

ERASMUS	Well you seem to have forgotten that I’m your father.

BEAU	Do you want to go there?

ERASMUS	No.

ERASMUS	Please. At least stay the night.

ERASMUS	Why is the music so loud?

ERASMUS	What?

PAUL	You were shouting.

ERASMUS	Oh. Yes.

KID	Yes! Yes!

ERASMUS	Well, this Christmas looks epic. Santa has come early.

KID	Well I’ll believe in Santa if this is what it gets me.

ERASMUS	Smokin’ board.

ERASMUS	Why don’t we have a proper breakfast tomorrow?

ERASMUS	We should start a brioche.

ERASMUS	And then perhaps something sweet. A nutty sticky bun.

KID	That means Paul, go make brioche and a sticky nutty bun.

PAUL	Don’t I know it.

PAUL	Who would like a drink? Beau?

BEAU	I’m sober.

PAUL	Ah, yes. So am I.

PAUL	Unlike you, however, I’m going to do something about it.

ERASMUS	I’ll have a

PAUL	I know.

ERASMUS	What is it?

PAUL	They’re gone.

PAUL	They’re gone.

ERASMUS	I didn’t even get to say goodbye.

PAUL	I know. Me either.

PAUL	We drove 200 miles to get here. You said you would meet us.

PAUL	All right, we’ve been here for hours.

PAUL	We look like a couple of child predators.

PAUL	The only thing we’re missing is a white van.

ERASMUS	I apologize for my friend. We’re quite normal.

ERASMUS	Want some candy?

ERASMUS	Are you all right?

ERASMUS	Well, you sound like you may have relapsed.

ERASMUS	No, don’t get me wrong. No, I used to love cocaine.

ERASMUS	I mean, let’s talk about what we have in common.

ERASMUS	All right, let’s not.

ERASMUS	I’m just saying that if you need help, I know a very good rehab facility...

ERASMUS	in Tucson, Arizona.

ERASMUS	It has a high failure rate, but the food’s terrific.

ERASMUS	And the group sessions are hilarious. Hello?

ERASMUS	Hello?

ERASMUS	Shall I move the orchid?

PAUL	It’s fine. 

ERASMUS	There’s a cloud that follows him around wherever he goes.

ERASMUS	It’s so depressing. He feels like he has to pass it on to other people.

ERASMUS	There’s like a broom up his ass.

ERASMUS	Oo, what’s going on--

ERASMUS	Hello.

PAUL	What’s going on in here?

ERASMUS	I was in the kitchen and I suddenly got very upset. Didn’t I?

TINO	Yeah.

ERASMUS	And Tino was comforting me.

PAUL	Why is the door closed?

ERASMUS	It’s not like that, Paul.

PAUL	Why is the door closed?

TINO	Nothing happened, Paul.

ERASMUS	I’m bereft about the child being gone.

PAUL	So am I.

ERASMUS	You didn’t even want him here.

PAUL	How can you say that?Shame on you.

PAUL	You dismiss me left and right, but I did all the work.

PAUL	I was the parent, you clowned around.

ERASMUS	Well all right, then.

PAUL	It doesn’t matter. We’re not talking about the kid.

PAUL	This is about that. Has it been going on since you hired him?

ERASMUS	I didn’t touch Tino.

ERASMUS	Nothing happened.He was just a shoulder to cry on.

PAUL	I’m your shoulder to cry on.

 PAUL	Anyway, it doesn’t matter what happened in there.

PAUL	It happened before, which you admit.

PAUL	With that gardener. You admit.

ERASMUS	Yes, I admit.

PAUL	Well, it’s going to happen again.

ERASMUS	It won’t happen again.

PAUL	Look, I think you and I both know...

PAUL	things have been pretty fucked up between us for a long time.

PAUL	And when the kid showed up, I pretended everything was fine.

PAUL	But I can’t pretend anymore. I can’t.

ERASMUS	Paul.

PAUL	Listen to me.

PAUL	You know that if you were dying...

PAUL	I would cut the heart out of my chest for you.

PAUL	I would die so that you would live. That‘s how much I love you.

PAUL	That’s how much I worship you.

PAUL	And I think that you actually know that.

PAUL	And it doesn’t matter to you.

ERASMUS	It does matter to me.

PAUL	It doesn’t matter. And I can’t stand it anymore.

PAUL	I didn’t tell you, but I got a call the other day from Rachel Ray.

ERASMUS	Oh.

ERASMUS	What’s she like? I hear she’s really nice.

PAUL	No, not from her, from my friends who produce her show.

PAUL	They offered me a job in New York.

PAUL	I’m going to take it.

PAUL	Well, I’m almost done up here.

PAUL	I just need to get my books from your office.

ERASMUS	Yeah, I boxed them all up last night.

PAUL	Thanks for your help.

PAUL	Did you get a spray tan?

ERASMUS	No.

ERASMUS	Jemimah, you had me at ski-in, ski-out.

ERASMUS	I’ll be there Friday. No I can’t come Thursday, I’ve got to see my lawyer.

ERASMUS	Oh, just stupid stuff.

ERASMUS	Yeah, you can have all these bags. I don’t really need them.

PAUL	Good. Because they’re mine.

ERASMUS	Oh.

PAUL	I think this might be the best thing for both of us.

ERASMUS	Well, we had a good run.

PAUL	Oh, remember to keep an eye on the tile guy tomorrow.

PAUL	I think he’s overbilling us.

ERASMUS	I don’t give a fuck what you think about the fucking tile guy...

ERASMUS	you fucking cunt!

PAUL	Oh. And you were doing so well.

ERASMUS	Please don’t leave me.

ERASMUS	I can’t live without you.

ERASMUS	Don’t go. Don’t go. Please, please, please, please.

ERASMUS	I love you.

DRIVER	I sure hope he’s not talkin’ to me.

PAUL	Fuck!

JUDGE	And this motion will be accepted by the court at this time.

JUDGE	The child shall remain in the custody...

JUDGE	of Erasmus Brumble and Paul Morgan.

ERASMUS	Well, I must say...

ERASMUS	all that courtroom melodrama makes a man very hungry.

PAUL	How are you doing?

KID	I’m hungry, too.

ERASMUS	So what should we eat?

PAUL	Let’s not do a whole thing tonight. I’m exhausted.

PAUL	Why don’t we just pick up some sushi?

ERASMUS	Supermarket sushi is like God shitting on mankind.

ERASMUS	It is everything that is wrong with this country.

PAUL	I didn’t say supermarket sushi.

PAUL	I’ve never had supermarket sushi in my life.

PAUL	Unless it was late at night and I was blackout drunk...

PAUL	and I don’t remember. And that probably happened.

ERASMUS	I could make some sushi.

ERASMUS	I did train with one of the world’s leading sushi chefs.

PAUL	That was at a demo at Williams Sonoma in Albuquerque.

PAUL	I was with you.

ERASMUS	Your version of eventsis so pedestrian.

PAUL	Also known as reality.

ERASMUS	Blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.

PAUL	Well, why don’t we just do a pasta at home?

ERASMUS	I’m trying to avoid wheat and dairy, Paul.

PAUL	Oh really? Is that since you had the grilled cheese sandwich for lunch?

ERASMUS	It’s a constant struggle.

PAUL	Yes, it most certainly is.

KID	Guys. Why don’t you ask me what I want for dinner?

PAUL	Well we just assumed it was Taco Bell.

KID	No. I still love it.

KID	But I’d like something else tonight.

ERASMUS	Really?

PAUL	What would you like?

KID	I’d like to have pork tenderloin...

KID	with caramelized apples and ginger.

ERASMUS	What the hell?

PAUL	What the fuck?

PAUL	All right, let’s get this kid a pork tenderloin.

KID	And maybe some polenta. With goat cheese.

PAUL	Oh my god. We’ve created a monster.

ERASMUS	I created a monster.

PAUL	No, you are a monster. And now I have to contend with two of you.

PAUL	Good god.

PAUL	Oh, Jesus.There’s a fucking rainbow.
