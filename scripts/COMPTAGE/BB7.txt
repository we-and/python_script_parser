TOM	When we’re children we strive to be as free as possible. Like birds soaring through the air. But when we grow up, we’re burdened with responsibilities. But we can still be happy. We can still be free. We just have to look at things from a new perspective. Tomorrow, a brand new transforming package will launch. And with it, the chance to truly find your own “Wild Land”.


VICK	Oh, hi, Wendy! Don’t worry. I’ve got everything ready, just waiting for the tourists.

VICK	Lookin’ good and bookin’ tours[O1]. Huh? Hello, this is Victor, how can I help you today? What?? Raymond?! Oh man, long time no see . You’re in town? Okay! Sounds great! Hehe, Alright! We’re going to have a reunion. Yeah! Woohoo! This is awesome! Yes!

BRAMBLE	Huh? Hey, but wait. Your last group was so long ago. What happened?

VICK	I didn’t invest back into the business, that’s all! But with this incredible new van here… (Snaps) I’ll have more groups than ever before. We’ll be able to go—conquer volcanoes, tame the seas, and delve deep into jungles. Just like in the movies.

BRIAR	Sounds like fun. 

VICK	Hehe, now if you’ll excuse me… I have a phone call. Wendy? Are the tourists ready? I’m gonna be there soon. 

WENDY	Vick, your group has cancelled.

VICK	No problem. What? Cancelled?

WENDY	They all went to Wild Land.

VICK	Hold on. I had to take out a loan to get the van, Wendy.. What am I supposed to do? Wendy?! Uh, typical.

PHOENIX	Ever wanted to fly like a bird? Or run like a cheetah?  Tired of your boring, ordinary life? Are you ready for the ultimate getaway? 

BRAMBLE	Woah,h, itthat’s awesome. I wanna go!

SEYMORE ODD	Hey Raymond, I’ve just got some new mummies for my shop. I need to re-touch up the wrappings though. They might come back to life! Talk to you later!

RAYMOND	Everyone RSVP’d. And now they’re not free. Why even bother if you’re not going to come? 

VICK	I guess everyone is just too busy.

RAYMOND	That was a bust. So… let’s go drink some tea.

VICK	Hey Raymond, have you heard of this place called...Wild Land? I lost a whole tour group to them. Humph! What do they have that I don’t? Ugh! 

RAYMOND	Huh? You’ve never heard of it? 

VICK	(Negative emote)

RAYMOND	Dude! They turn you into an animal! 

VICK	Huh?

VICK	That’s great. Your pet won a contest?

RAYMOND	Vick, that’s me. 

VICK	You?

RAYMOND	That’s right. I did the tournament last year. And, you’ll never guess what, I got third place!.

VICK	There’s a tournament? What do you have to do?

RAYMOND	You do challenges as animals. The first place is a million dollars.

VICK	A million ?

RAYMOND	But it gets better. Check this out!These are the previous winners. Now they’re all famous.  They’re in movies or on TV making  lots of money. It’s my dream, to stand on top of that podium. 

VICK	That does sound good…

RAYMOND	Really? Well then… How ‘bout we team up?

VICK	Say what?

RAYMOND	Of course! You’ve got skills. You’re a tour guide. You’re the perfect teammate. The two of us can win this whole thing, just trust me!

VICK	What about my tour groups?

RAYMOND	Come on. How much cash do you make from a tour? If we win this, you can lead tours… around the whole world! Okay, I’ll meet you at Wild Land. See you there.

VICK	A million dollars sure would change things for me.

VICK	You what?

LEON	I’m sorry.

VICK	Why you… Why’d you even bother?! Ypu’re just a bad man. Why are you doing this, huh? 

LEON	It’s just that...

VICK	I don’t care! You don’t know what I had to give up to do this. You only care about yourself! I’ve had it! I should’ve never agreed to work with you!

VICK	I’m such an idiot. I should’ve known I wasn’t gonna win. For a while there I felt different. Things like this always happen to me. I don’t know what it is, but I feel like my life’s cursed. 

LEON	uess mine is too.

BRAMBLE	Hey Vick!

PHOENIX	Half your time is up. You can do it!

BRAMBLE	Where’d he go? Hey Vick!

LEON	I’m sorry this happened. But try to understand.

LEON	I’m here for my daughter.

VICK	Daughter?

LEON	(Acknowledgement emote)

VICK	Is that her?

LEON	It’s her favorite song.

VICK	She’s adorable.

LEON	Yeah… But she… got so sick. She couldn’t walk anymore.

LILY	Thank you, daddy!

LEON	Oh? Someone lost their bunny!

LILY	(Happy emote)Wow! It’s flying! 

LILY	Daddy! I feel like I’m a bird!

LEON	I love Lily with all of my heart. So for her birthday, I wanted to show her that. Nothing in the world…

LILY	Wow!

LEON	…is more important than she is.

VICK	I didn’t expect... for you to have… such a sad story. You’re such a good father.

LEON	No I’m not. But I’m trying to do something for her.

VICK	You need the money for her cure! Don’t I know it. Being broke is my entire life. But you can’t just give up like this. Lily needs you to win.

LEON	You’re right! Let’s find a way out. And then we’re gonna win this thing.

BRAMBLE	Vick! Hey there you are.

SHIRLEY	Hi.

VICK	We’re saved! Lucky you were here. Thank you so much.Thank you! What a stroke of luck. You guys are the best.

SHIRLEY	We were passing by. No big deal. 

LEON	The gold ball! This is our chance.

VICK	Yeah! We’re still in this thing. Ready? Charge!

LEADER OF THE LION TEAM	Is that...

ALL LIONS	The gold ball!

RAYMOND	Look. The gold ball!

PHOENIX	The ten point gold ball finally appears! The first place team only has nine points. So whoever catches the ball wins the tournament!

MONKEY	Are you okay?

SHIRLEY	Are you okay?

PATRICK	I think so. But my head really hurts.

VICK	Keep your eyes open! We have to find that ball otherwise we’ll never win this thing. 

LEON	Look out! If we get hit we’re out.

LEADER OF THE WOLF TEAM	Maintain formation. This is too easy.

ONE OF THE LIONS	That’s what you dogs get.

PHOENIX	That’s two more teams outta the game!

VICK	This is crazy!

TERRY	Got it!

RAYMOND	Terry, where do you keep all of these weights?

BRAMBLE	There it is!

PHOENIX	Shirley’s team resigned due to health problems. That means only two teams are left! Tom’s and Vick’s!

TERRY	So close…

PHOENIX	Terry and Tom are out.

RAYMOND	Guess it’s up to me.

VICK	Bramble! Throw me!

BRAMBLE	Right.

VICK	Bramble!

BRAMBLE	That wasn’t very nice…

PHOENIX	Only thirty seconds left.

LEON	Vick, we need to surround it.

VICK	You’re right. How?

LEON	Let’s split up. We can do this.

RAYMOND	Come to papa!

PHOENIX	It’s the final moments of the game. Ten seconds left. Five, four, three, two, one. Time is up. 

BRAMBLE	Oh man, did we get the ball?

VICK	We did it. We won the tournament! 

PHOENIX	And that settles it. The Wild Land Tournament is over. The winner is Vick’s Team[O8]!

VICK	Leon, we actually pulled it off! 

VICK	We won and we did it as a team! Oh yeah!

PHOENIX	The winners gets a special ride in a hot air balloon!

TERRY	They’re incredible.

TOM	They are! But he...seems familiar. It’s him!

RAYMOND	Maybe… I should apologize. Then maybe next time That’s weird. What was that? Hey Vick! Help me! Something’s wrong…

VICK	Wow!

BRAMBLE	Woo! 

VICK	 It’s beautiful up here! Hey, Leon. cheer up a little bit. We actually did it. I saw you save me at the end, if you ever needLeon, I’m your guy okay? And don’t forget, most of that money is going to you. It’s for Lily?

VICK/BRAMBLE	Leon!

TOM	You don’t know him, but I do. He’s a thief.

VICK	Leon, how could you?

LEON	It’s not what it looks like.

VICK	What does that mean? What about Lily?

VICK	Wait… You lied. You lied right to my face. There is no Lily, is there?.I thought we were friends. I wanted to help you. But you’re just as bad as the rest. Liar!

LEON	I am not a liar!

VICK	Maybe Tom can help.

SHIRLEY	Yeah!

BRAMBLE	Oh? What is this?

TOURIST A	My head hurts so much. Huh?! Whydid I change?!

BRAMBLE/SHIRLEY/VICK	Ah!

VICK	Run for it! This guy’s lost it![O9]

BRAMBLE	We’re not afraid of you!

BRAMBLE/SHIRLEY/VICK	Ah!

SHIRLEY	Huh? Where’s Vick?

VICK	I’m. Down. Here. Urgh,  I’m gonna taste sand for a week.

SHIRLEY	Huh? Guys look! It’s here.

BRAMBLE/SHIRLEY/VICK	(Cough)

BRAMBLE	It seems a little dusty.

SHIRLEY	This way.

SHIRLEY	Wow!

BRAMBLE	So many toys.

VICK	The sky was[O10] so blue today. Daddy took me…

LILY	Daddy took me to the forest. I saw many animals. [O11]They’re all my friends. It was so fun! I wish daddy could [O12]laugh more, he doesn’t seem as happy as he used to be[??13].[O14]

VICK	Leon?

BRAMBLE	What’re you reading, Vick?

LILY	The sun didn’t come out today so I can’t go outside. I’m so sad. [O15]If only I could turn into a bird, then I’ll be able to fly to the forest. I t old daddy about my wish and he said he can make it come true. I believe in daddy. Today is my happiest day ever. Daddy gave me an incredible gift.[O16]

LILY	Wow! I can really fly now! I wish everyone could be as happy as me[??17]!

SHIRLEY	It says Leon[O18] and Lily.

BRAMBLE	That means… this was his home.

LEON	I’ve always hoped that you would recover. But you still left this world. I will always love you[??19]! [O20]

BRAMBLE	What’s wrong?

VICK	Leon didn’t lie to me.

BRAMBLE	What?

VICK	He told me about Lily. I just didn’t know that… she was gone already.

SHIRLEY	I think he gave you this—because he trusts you.

BRAMBLE	Look at this.

VICK	The logo.

VICK	He’s a scientist. He invented all this stuff. 

BRAMBLE	Whoa, look at this.

VICK	Whoa (Off screen They created Wild Land together…

BRAMBLE	Then why is Tom after Leon?

VICK	We gotta find out. What’s this? You can’t turn back after you Super Transform.

SHIRLEY	Then all the guests…

RAYMOND	Argh 

TOURIST A	My head hurts so much. Huh ?! Why did I change?!

LEON	I’m not a liar. He’s dangerous.

VICK	This is bad. The Super Transform is unstable.Leon was trying to stop Tom.

BRAMBLE	That’s why Tom captured him.

VICK	Exactly. And why they took our friends. It’s a cover-up.

SHIRLEY	We have to save them.

BRAMBLE	But where are they keeping them?

VICK	Tom probably has them. Let’s rock’n’roll!

SHIRLEY	Hahaha.

BRAMBLE	Oh man, this is the best van ever!

SHIRLEY	For sure. It drove to you by itself.

VICK	It’s the latest model. Super hi-tech.Hold on!

BRAMBLE	Oh, here’s the gear I got from that scalper.

VICK	Perfect!

VICK	We’ve arrived in style. Let’s go.

BRAMBLE	Come on, Vick, can’t you fly faster?

VICK	Maybe if I you were a koala bear.

GORILLA	Hey Terry, why are we catching guests?

TERRY	Tom said there’s a small issue.

GORILLA	All of  the contestants used the Super Transform though. Is it broken?

TERRY	Stop talking or I’ll make you do a hundred push-ups.

VICK	They’re taking every guest that they can find.

BRAMBLE	Wait, where’re you going?

VICK	We should split up. I’ll follow them.

BRAMBLE	And we’ll stay up here and keep on looking.

VICK	I wonder if I’m close. 

TOM	Leon! How’ve you been?

LEON	Tom. You-

TOM	Just calm down. Have a seat. Some coffee. No cream or sugar. It’s good to see you. You don’t visit anymore. The park is a success. You must be happy. Today… You went through a lot of trouble for this. I wonder why.

LEON	You know why I came back. I destroyed the Super Transform tech. Why are you using it?

TOM	It’s such a great invention. And you just want it to disappear?Technology isn’t perfect. But we still use it every day right?

LEON	What are you talking about? People who use this lose themselves and then they get stuck like that. You’ve seen it. You have to stop all this.

TOM	Phoenix, pull up the reports.

PHOENIX	 Roger!

TOM	Surely you trust your best invention? Phoenix solved it.The form is stable now. It works perfectly.

LEON	But… But I saw Raymond go feral.

VICK	Raymond?

TOM	He was just mad after losing. Just look at how much people love this.Wasn’t spreading happiness why we created Wild Land?

BRAMBLE	Wait. Hold on.

SHIRLEY	What wrong?

BRAMBLE	Smells like my brother’s nearby.

SHIRLEY	What is this place?

BRAMBLE	Ah!

SHIRLEY	Shh.

BRAMBLE	Briar! Oh no. I’m here Bro. I’ll get you out!

SHIRLEY	Don’t worry. He’s just asleep.

BRAMBLE	Briar, Briar, oh bro, you’re okay! Why are you in there? I’m here to save you.

BRIAR	It’s too dangerous here. We need leave now. I saw monsters here.

SHIRLEY	Patrick? Monkey?

BRIAR	Ah! Run for it!

BRAMBLE	Briar, grab my hand!

SHIRLEY	Patrick, Monkey…

BRIAR	What are all these monsters for?

BRAMBLE	Bro, I’m scared…

LEON	Tom, the tech doesn’t work like you think it does. I’m begging you! You have to shut it down now.

TOM	I see your stubbornness hasn’t changed. This is no longer your concern.

TERRY	Bad news Mister Tom! All of the guests have escaped!

LEON	I told you it’s not safe!

TOM	Phoenix, how did they get out?

PHOENIX	 I’m not sure. But I’ll take care of this.

LEON	You’ve lost your mind. Traitor!

TOM	How dare you? You’ve gone mad! My gear!

LEON	The only way to stop this, is to destroy it for good.

TOM	You can try.


VICK	What’s happening?

TOM	To think I called you my friend. This ends here, Leon.

VICK	Ahhh! Heehee. That was pretty cool, wasn’t it?

SHIRLEY	We need to find Vick.

BRAMBLE	It’s Leon! And Vick!

VICK	Briar, what are you doing here?

BRIAR	They locked me up with the guests.

BRAMBLE	Shirley’s friends and the rest have gone wild!

LEON	You all should get out while you can.

BRAMBLE	But… what about you?

LEON	I have to destroy Tom’s gear, then turn everyone back.

VICK	Don’t worry. We’ll help you.

BRIAR	We’re a team.

TOM	You! It won’t be that easy.

TOM	This game ends now.

VICK	Looks like we’re doing it the hard way. 

TOM	You can’t escape us.

BRAMBLE	I give up.

GORILLA	Hey! Stop!

TERRY	Finally, a workout. Let’s bench press.

VICK	I can’t keep this up forever. Got it!

VICK	Shirley, turn him around!

SHIRLEY	Gotcha!

VICK	Alright. I’m going after Tom.

SHIRLEY	(Acknowledgement emote)

TOM	This is almost fun.

BRIAR	Ah!

TERRY	Alright. The shot-put.

BRIAR	Ah!

BRAMBLE	Hehehe.

TERRY	Daily exercise is good for your health!

BRAMBLE	Let go of my brother!

BRAMBLE	Briar!  Briar, did you see that?

TOM	Poor Vick, you could’ve just stayed the champion and enjoyed your money. Instead, you’ll never leave this place.

VICK	My million bucks. (Sobs) (Thinking) You need an animal, Vick… Hey!

TOM	There you are!

VICK	I got it! I got it guys!

CROWD	Yay!

LEON	One last thing… We have to undo the transformations.

VICK	I’ll help you.[O21]

LEON	Thanks.

VICK	What’s happening?

LEON	Quick, hide!

SHIRLEY	This is bad.

VICK	Okay guys, get everybody out of here.

BRAMBLE	This is your van key.

VICK	She’s my baby! Don’t crash her! 

BRAMBLE	Don’t worry, Vick, we got this!

TOM	They ruined everything. 

LEON	Thank you for your help Vick.

VICK	 Don’t mention it. You invented this stuff?

LEON	I created it for my daughter Lily. You should’ve seen how happy it made her. She was so kind. The first thing she thought of was sharing it with other people. I asked Tom to help me build this place.Wild Land was her biggest wish. But I messed up. I invented the Super form.Now we’re all in danger. 

VICK	It’s not your fault. Tom’s power-hungry and greedy. Leon. You can fix this.

LEON	Okay.

ELEVATOR	Master control room.

VICK	Whoa, this place is so cool. And totally hi-tech.

PHOENIX	 Long time no see, Mister Leon!

VICK	Hey! That’s the tournament host.

LEON	It’s an AI I designed. Its name is Phoenix. 

VICK	That’s incredible!

PHOENIX	 Accepted. You’re cleared for full user clearance.

LEON	Phoenix, shut down the Super Transform matrix.

PHOENIX	 No can do boss.

LEON	What do you mean?

PHOENIX	 Contradicting command. Access denied.

VICK	What’s that mean?

LEON	Who gave the command?

LEON	You’re finally done. The Wild Land AI. Alright Phoenix,make everyone happy.

VICK	You’ think everyone’s happy?

PHOENIX	 I was made for creating joy for people. But it was never enough for anybody.Their ordinary lives make them so miserable.

RANDOM PERSON	I finally have a break from all the homework! 

RANDOM PERSON #	I work overtime every day and my boss bullies me.

RANDOM PERSON #	I never get to see my family anymore.

PHOENIX	 They have a little bit of happiness here, but it’s not enough.Super Transform is perfect because they don’t have to change back. They are completely free. This is the truest happiness!

LEON	That means… You never destroyed it before. You lied to Tom!

PHOENIX	 Destroying the technology is against the core command, so I couldn’t do it.

LEON	Phoenix… I’m shutting you down.

PHOENIX	 Sorry boss, but I just can’t let you do that either. 

VICK	Ah?

LEON	Ah?

PHOENIX	 Here’s the man of the hour, good ole Tom.

LEON	Phoenix, what have you done to him?

PHOENIX	 I’ve just been making sure he stays a team player.

LEON	You what? Have you been using him since I made the Super transform?

PHOENIX	 Yep! This is the best choice for everybody!

VICK	Leon, you’ve gotta shut it down. I’ll buy you some time.

LEON	Careful!

LEON	Come on. Come on.

LEON	Oh no, Vick! Almost there.

PHOENIX	 This isn’t a good idea Leon.

LEON	Let’s end this.

LILY	Daddy.

LEON	Lily. Lily! Oh Lily!

LILY	Daddy.

LEON	I thought that I lost you. I missed you so much.

LEON	Lily! You’re walking around.

LILY	Yep! I’m okay! I can even race my bunny now!

LILY	Daddy, I want to play with the blocks. Let’s build a house for all the animals! Will you help me? 

LEON	Of course. Daddy’s always here to help.

VICK	Ah? Leon! What’d you do?!

PHOENIX	 Didn’t I  tell you already, Mister Vick, I’m programmed for happiness? He’s having a nice little dream.

VICK	Leon.

VICK	I’ll shut you down myself!

PHOENIX	 I’m afraid I can’t let that happen. 

TOM/PHOENIX	 I’m trying to help everyone find happiness. They’ll be no more stress or work or sadness when I’m done! Don’t you get it? I can bring joy to the whole world!

VICK	You can’t…

BRIAR	These things are everywhere!

LITTLE BOY	Daddy.

SHIRLEY	Come on.

LITTLE BOY	Daddy. Daddy!

VICK	Leon!

LILY	The sky is blue today. The clouds have gone away. The sun above, shining with love….

LEON	Lily, I… Daddy has something he has to do. How about we play with this later?

LILY	Okay, daddy.

LEON	Lily… I’m so happy to see you again! Even if... it’s in a dream like this. It’s worth it. I know once I leave, it’ll be like losing you all over again. I wish I could just hold onto you forever.

LILY	Daddy! Look! I made it so tall!

LILY	Daddy, why’re you crying?

LEON	Lily. I don’t want to lose you.

LILY	Daddy, I’ll never leave you. You can’t lose me if I’m here.

LEON	Lily.

VICK	Leon!

PHOENIX	 How did you get out?!

VICK	Leon, shut him down.

BRIAR	We can’t hold out much longer!

TOM	How foolish.You should’ve stayed asleep. You really are a pain.

LEON	Here! Break the glass! No you don’t.

PHOENIX	 Why are trying to stop me?! What’s wrong with… 

BRAMBLE	We need Vick to save us!

SHIRLEY	They’re almost through the glass!

BRIAR	You guys stay here. I’ll check it out.

BRIAR	Look guys! Everyone is changing back.

KID	Daddy. Daddy.

FATHER	Tim! I’m so happy. (Sobbing)

KID	Daddy.

PATRICK/MONKEY	Shirley.

SHIRLEY	You guys! Thank goodness you’re back to normal.

RAYMOND	What? What happened to this place?

CROWD	I’m human again!

BRAMBLE	It worked. Vick and Leon did it!

SHIRLEY	Thank you so much.

BRAMBLE	Well we all did it as a team. Hehehe.

SHIRLEY	Do you think Vick and Leon are okay?

TOM	(Coughs)

VICK	We did it, Leon! We really did it! Yay! Haha.

LEON	Yeah. It’s really over.

NEWS	We are live here at Wild Land Park, discussing the startling events of the day. We have Vick with us, the hero who managed to save hundreds of guests. Is there anything you’d like to share?

VICK	Hehe. Well, I’m no hero. But I did learn that if you find something that makes you happy, you have to hold onto it. No matter what.

KIDS	Hahaha.

KIDS	Look! Look! It’s so pretty!

LITTLE GIRL	Wow, it’s everywhere! Thank you Mr. Vick, I’ve never seen snow before!

KID	Yeah! It’s so cool!

SHIRLEY	How about we all go ice skating when we get there?

KIDS	Yay! Yay!

RAYMOND	Good idea! After that, we can eat lunch. I found a great place online yesterday.

KIDS	I want chicken soup!/Me too!/Yummy!

RAYMOND	What do we want?

KIDS	The best tour ever. That’s what we want!

BRIAR	Oh man, the kids are having the time of their life. 

BRAMBLE	And  I am too!

VICK	Welcome to Crystal Peaks.

KIDS	Yay!

RAYMOND	It’s Spring Festival, but no one is here. Never mind, let’s dig in.

VICK	What? Come on, Raymond. This is a joke, right?

RAYMOND	You gotta have some class Vick. This green onion is from France. British garlic. And this is a soup from Japan brewed with mountain water.

VICK	So it’s expensive, and it’s awful. 

RAYMOND	Now you get it. Eat up!

VICK	Even aliens wouldn’t eat this. I can’t believe you brought me here.

RAYMOND	Oh man! You saw the news too?A UFO was spotted around Pine Tree Mountain
