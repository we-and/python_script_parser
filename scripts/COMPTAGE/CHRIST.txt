Ernie	What I am now about to recount is a true Christmas story.

Ernie	And like so many stories, this one begins far far away. 

Ernie	So far, in fact, that you should allow for a pee break or two.

Ernie	Here among snow covered fields and row upon row of apple trees

Ernie	Lies a small farm. Cattle Hill.

Ernie	I was here that I learned the meaning of Christmas.

Gavin	Shouldn't we… hey, hey, hey… Uncle Baart! Uncle Baart!

Baart	Right, let's give it a shake, get the snow off, It's coming… Move, Gavin, move!

Gavin	Shouldn't we… hey, hey, hey… Uncle Baart! Uncle Baart!

Baart	Oh, great.

Ernie	We all have our expectations of how Christmas should be.

Ernie	Maybe you think it's the high point of the year, with cakes, decorations and presents.

Ernie	But for me, Christmas is about something else entirely.

Ernie	And who would have thought that a determined little girl would be the one to show me.

Clara	Oh.

Clara	Let's see… There, there, and there you are!

Clara	I think that was all of them. You're welcome.

Man in street	Thanks, and have a good Christmas.

Clara	You too.

Clara	I hope you have a really great Christmas.

Clara	Bye now!

Voice on phone	I'd like two kilos of spare ribs. Two kilos.

Voice on phone	Excuse me? Two kilos.

Clara	Christmas!

Clara	Hi, Mum.

Karen	Wait a moment Clara, I'll just find it. Hang on…

Clara	Christmas has officially started.

Karen	Ooh! Ah! Wow!

Karen	Well, the power company is going to have a good Christmas, anyway.

Clara	Well, it's only once a year, you know.

Karen	Yes, I know. You and Christmas, Clara.

Karen	Dad's going to have his hands full with you this year.

Clara	We’re going to bake ginger snaps, go tobogganing, have snow ball fights, open presents, sing Christmas songs...

Karen	Yes, sure, Clara. But even if it is your first Christmas at Cattle Hill, you don’t have to go over the top. 

Clara	When's Dad coming, do you think?

Karen	Oh, I'll bet he'll be on his way soon.

Karen	Come on, Clara, let's open up.

Biff	No, no, I'll be…. Typical,

Biff	No one wants broken ginger snaps.

Baart	No, Gavin, w...wait….

Baart	You can't go running off now? 

Baart	We've only reached item 38 on the list, and there are just two days left until Christmas.

Gavin	But Uncle, we've been at it since this morning. 

Baart	Yes, but now we have to fill the stockings, and all that…

Biff	Hi there! 

Baart	It's one of the most import…..

Biff	Getting all worked up about Christmas again, Baart?

Baart	No, this is the year, Biff.

Baart	This year Sætra is going to win Christmas House of the Year.

Baart	And I am going to be on the cover of Sheds and Wildlife

Baart	....you'll see. Guaranteed.

Biff	Well, come on Gavin. Let's be off. 

Gavin	Bye.

Baart	Yeah, 'bye, and don't die on that thing Gavin. And Biff, remember the electric plugs!

Gavin	Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Boy	Look, they've got those sugarfree cola pigs! 

Boy	Oh, they've got so much here!

Gavin	Gosh, they certainly like Christmas here.

Gavin	Did you see that? 

Gavin	That was the Emigos. They're my favourite band.

Gavin	They play the best EDM. 

Biff	EDM, is that one of those, uh, computer games? That what you mean?

Gavin	No, no, EDM. Dance music. 

Biff	Ah, yeah, dance music. Yeah. 

Biff	I play that too, you know, so…

Biff	So we could jam together, eh. Yeah… 

Gavin	Great.

Ernie	Ooops…ooops…

Clara	Morning, Ernie. 

Ernie	Hi. Look, sorry about this…

Clara	No worries. What can I do for you?

Ernie	Oh, I’m just out taking some photos for the Christmas issue of Sheds and Wildlife

Ernie	And I thought I could take some here, in your place?

Clara	Yes, of course you can. 

Ernie	Oh, great. 

Clara	So who is going to get Christmas House of the Year this time round? 

Ernie	That's a secret that is, Clara.

Ernie	And smile… You'll just have to wait for the Christmas issue.

Biff	Hi, Clara.

Clara	Dad! 

Biff	Wow! 

Biff	It's so good to see you, honey.

Gavin	Hi. 

Clara	Gavin! You got away!

Biff	Gavin and I are going to be jamming together on Christmas Eve. 

Clara	I thought we were going to play something together.

Biff	Would you two help me bring the goods in? 

Gavin	I've composed a banging Christmas song for us. 

Clara	Terrific!  I'm looking forward to that.

Karen	Thanks for having Clara this Christmas.

Biff	Uh yeah, I…

Karen	She's really looking forward to celebrating Christmas with you.

Biff	Yeah, and I'm looking forward to spending Chrsitmas with her, too. 

Biff	I don't usually do a whole lot about this sort of thing, but…

Biff	Well, right. And what about you? 

Biff	Maybe you ...

Clara	Shall we go?

Biff	Yeah, sure. I just have to bring in these last boxes, then…

Biff	Yeah!

Clara	Bye then, Mum.

Karen	Goodbye, honey. 

Clara	I'm going to miss you, Mum. 

Karen	And I'm going to miss you, Clara.

Clara	Bye, Mum!

Karen	Bye, Drive carefully.

Biff	Yeah, sure. 

Clara	Merry Christmas! 

Gavin	Merry Christmas! 

Gavin	Yeah!  We've got load of Christmas decorations up at our place.

Gavin	Uncle Baart's got this big Christmas book, with a schedule we have to follow.

Gavin	Eighty-nine tasks that have to be done for Christmas to happen.

Gavin	And we still have to hang up the dangly hook, make the almond cake, dance the Gnome Dance...

Clara	Gnome Dance?

Gavin	Yes. So the Gnome doesn't get sore.

Clara	Do you really think there's a Gnome at Cattle Hill?

Gavin	Think? There is a Gnome.

Clara	Hardly.

Gavin	It's true! 

Clara	have you actually seen a Gnome?

Gavin	Not exactly ...

Gavin	But my grandfather often used to tell me a story…

Gavin	Once upon a time there was a Gnome who looked after a huge farm.

Gavin	A farm with a beautiful orchard full of cherry trees and red currant bushes…

Gavin	And the Gnome used to help everyone who lived there, often without them knowing it.

Gavin	And he protected the farm from illness and vermin and fire.

Gavin	The farm flourished. And the family grew in size,and they had many happy years together. 

Gavin	But then one Christmas, everything changed. Because the children had been teasing the Gnome. 

Gavin	And they hadn't given him the single bowl of porridge he was supposed to get every Christmas, either. 

Gavin	So the Gnome left the farm. And everything started to go wrong.

Gavin	The fruit rotted on the trees, the raspberry bushes withered, and mice ate up everything in the food stores. 

Gavin	So the family was forced to leave. And no one has seen them since.

Gavin	And no one has seen them since. 

Clara	Gosh, so the Gnome really does help out? And is he nice, as well? 

Gavin	Well, a farm without a Gnome won't be a farm any longer. 

Biff	Anyway, we're almost there

Gavin	He's not always nice. Uncle Baart got called the black sheep of the family for years after the Gnome threw dung in his bed.

Gavin	Chucked it right in there, so he lay down in all that poo. 

Baart	Well, that's a pretty good hole, right there. 

Biff	Hi, Baart!

Baart	Well, that takes care of the Tatty Trousers curse. 

Gavin	It's when we bury all the trousers that have holes in them. 

Clara	Huh?

Baart	Nope, there won't be a Christmas if that's not done.

Baart	Coming to the Rekost Mart then? 

Baart	Mighty fine prawns this year.

Baart	Biff, did you remember the extension cable?

Biff	Sure.

Biff	Careful, Baart! 

Baart	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes!

Clara	Oh, cool! Wow!

Biff	Gosh!

Baart	Sheds and Wildlife are going to wet themselves with seasonal glee.

Baart	It's the front cover for us this year. Guaranteed.

Baart	And maybe a ewe will show up… and the ewe will...

Baart	Hey, where are you going?Get back here, on the roof! No, no…

Biff	Yeah well, just let me know if you need any help, Baart. Come on, you two… 

Chicklina	(sings) Give me a great big rooster… 

Clara	Chickolina!

Chicklina	Great to see you. I was in the middle of a trance dance here, praying to the Moon Man. 

Clara	Huh?

Chicklina	I invoke the Moon Man from time to time in the hope he'll send me a really fit rooster with a great big c… 

Biff	Yo.

Chicklina	Comb!

Biff	You need to clear the snow off your roof there.

Chicklina	That Baart is coming here to help me, so we'll see about that. 

Biff	Well, that's good.

Biff	Bye.

Clara	See you.

Chicklina	See you at Moon Shift.

Gavin	You lot in town have such a cool sense of humour, hee hee…

Gavin	A tea bag? On the tree?

Clara	What is this?

Biff	Umm... You talking about the new curtains?


Biff	Yeah, right Chickolina made them. Nice, aren't they?

Clara	Haven't you put up any decorations?

Biff	Uh, not that many.

Clara	I'd been really looking forward to coming here, spending my first Christmas with you, and you haven't done a thing.

Biff	But I've - uh - got some old things in the barn. 

Biff	We can go and take a look, and fix things up in here tomorrow. 

Clara	Tomorrow? If I'd known it was going to be like this, I wouldn't have come up here. 

Biff	What?

Clara	I'd have stayed in town with Mum. 

Biff	What, stayed in town?

Clara	Yes.

Biff	I have to take this.

Biff	This is Biff.

Pauline	Oh Biff, this is terrible. I'm snowed in. 

Biff	Snowed in?

Pauline	At Hog Haven.

Clara	Why hasn't he done anything about Christmas?

Biff	Hog Haven?

Gavin	Uh, I don't think he  celebrates Christsmas, actually.

Gavin	Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen a Christmas tree or Christmas decorations here.

Pauline	You have to come here!

Clara	That rightt?

Biff	No, I can't come now. Clara has just arrived, and…

Pauline	May I remind you that it's your job to clear snow? You're to come now! Right away. 

Biff	Pauline has got herself snowed in, and I'd better get over there with the plough to… uh… 

Biff	But listen, I've arranged  a surprise for you both in the barn.

Biff	You can check it out until I get back. 

Biff	And we can fix things up here when I come home, Clara. 

Biff	OK?

Clara	Yes. OK.

Biff	Bye.

Gavin	Bye.

Gavin	Are you all right, Clara?

Clara	Yes.

Gavin	Come on. Let's go and take a look at the surprise in the barn. 

Clara	Yeah.

Gavin	Wow, that is so cool.

Gavin	Wowsa! It's a Molon Q-30!

Gavin	He's done us pretty proud, eh?

Gavin	And it's got a spectral analyzer. Wowsaroony!  It's got an arpeggio button.

Clara	Right.

Gavin	And it's got a spectral analyzer. Wowsaroony!  It's got an arpeggio button.

Gavin	Oh, great...

Clara	Why does he have all these Christmas decorations when he doesn't use them?

Gavin	So cool! Look at that light, and...

Clara	Wow, look! There's lots of great stuff here

Gavin	Some great speakers, and...

Gavin	Just imagine him setting all this up for us, Clara? Hmm… OK… Let's see here…

Clara	Crikey, look at this!

Clara	Here are Mum and Dad, and me as a baby.

Clara	Look!

Clara	Oh, look! Look how lovely it's been here. 

Clara	That big Christmas tree.

Gavin	Wow.

Clara	It's terrific.

Clara	Gavin? Is Dad usually by himself at Christmas? 

Gavin	Yes, I think so. I think he works quite a bit. 

Clara	Works? On Christmas Eve?


Gavin	Yeah. Uncle Baart, like, complains about the racket the tractor makes when he's listening to the Silver Boys' Choir.

Clara	Oh.

Gavin	But now you're here, I'm sure he's really looking forward loads to having Christmas with you. 

Gavin	Hey?

Clara	Yeah?

Gavin	Are you ready?

Clara	What for?

Gavin	To hear my new song? 

Clara	Oh yes! Let's hear it!

Gavin	OK. But I've only spent half an  hour or so on it.

Clara	Ok

Gavin	Plus a few days.

Clara	OK.

Gavin	Well, a week, but......

Clara	Gavin!

Gavin	OK, but it's a bit weird.

Clara	Gavin! Play it!

Gavin	Oh, uh, all right. Ha ha…

Clara	Yahoo! Brilliant!

Baart	Are, there you are, you little rascal.

Baart	You always come back.

Baart	Listen, what are you thinking, having this much snow on your roof? 

Chickolina	The snow drifts down and settles where it wants to. Who am I to clear it? 

Chickolina	Be careful, now. 

Baart	I am being careful.

Chickolina	I meant, with the snow.

Baart	Snow? Clearing snow/What a way to go…

Baart	My grand piano? 

Chickolina	Jumping Giblets! Baart? Baart? Where are you?

Baart	My hotplate?

Chickolina	Jumping Giblets! Baart? Baart? Where are you?

Baart	My accordion. That's out of tune now.

Chickolina	That is the wrost thing I have ever witnessed.

Baart	Yup, that didn't go too well. 

Baart	At least it'll be perfect for the summer. 

Chickolina	The summer? What have you gone and done? 

Baart	Who, me? I haven't gone and done anything. No. Your roof tried to finish off old Baart here.

Chickolina	Oh! My satellite dish! 

Baart	Well, that'll be covered by the insurance, right?

Chickolina	I don't have anywhere to stay over Moon Shift. I'm going to have to stay with you.

Chickolina	Until… you've fixed the roof.

Baart	U… no. No, no, no.

Chickolina	Yes. And you have to fix the dish. 

Pauline	At last. Did you have to go all the way around the ring road, or what? 

Biff	But.. You're not snowed in?

Pauline	Can you clear snow?

Biff	That little pile? Surely you could have managed that yourself? 

Pauline	Myself? There are lots of things here I need help with. 

Biff	Oh? What?

Pauline	Well. Let's see. The icicles are a real hazard. They need to go, and I can't reach them. 

Pauline	That drive is slick as soap. It needs sanding, and I have back trouble.Ouch…

Pauline	The porch needs clearing, and I can't find the shovel. 

Biff	It's right behind you? 

Pauline	Huh?

Biff	Did you get me all the way out here to do things you can't manage to do yourself?

Pauline	Have you had a good Christmas so far, Biff?

Pauline	How are things going with your Uncle Arne?

Biff	I don't have an Uncle Arne, Pauline.

Biff	And this, I can't be doing with it.

Pauline	What? I can't remember my internet password.

Biff	Talk soon, Pauline, and I hope you have great Christmas. 

Biff	No. There's an avalanche. 

Pauline	What?

Biff	Avalanche!

Pauline	Oh.

Biff	Take cover!

Pauline	Absolutely. Terrible internet cover up here. Useless. 

Biff	We're snowed in

Pauline	Oh. So you're  going to be here for a while, then. 

Chickolina	Baart?

Baart	Be careful.

Baart	SONG: “American Woman" begins.

Chickolina	I've seen worse damage. Today.

Gavin	It's good.

Clara	Really good.

Gavin	You liked it?

Clara	Yeah! Mega cool.

Gavin	What was that?

Clara	Where did it come from?

Gavin	From the barn's ceiling.

Gavin	Maybe it was a mouse? 

Clara	Mice couldn't have done that.

Clara	Let's go and take a look. 

Clara	Come on, then.

Gavin	Yeah...

Clara	Look, Gavin, look…

Gavin	What?

Clara	What is it? 

Gavin	Wow

Gavin	It must be where the Gnome lives. 

Clara	Yeah. The Gnome. 

Clara	Look how nice it is in there.

Clara	The spoon. Look.

Clara	N I E L S, Niels

Clara	Shall we? Shall we go inside? 

Gavin	But  Clara…

Gavin	Maybe we shouldn't really be here. 

Gavin	The Gnome shouldn't be disturbed. We could drive him away, or something. 

Clara	Is he dangerous? 

Gavin	No, I don't think so. 

Gavin	I think I may have hit my head. 

Gavin	I can hear this ringing sound.

Clara	It's the phone, Gavin.

Gavin	Yes...

Clara	Maybe it's Dad! 

Clara	Hallo? Cattle Hill?

Biff	Hallo?

Clara	Dad?

Biff	Hi there, Clara! Listen, something's happened here.

Clara	What?

Biff	There was an avalanche, and I'm snowed in with Pauline.

Clara	Oh gosh, are you both all right? 

Biff	Sure thing, we're fine for the moment. But we're snowed in. 

Biff	So I won't be home before tomorrow.

Biff	There's a whole lot of snow here. 

Biff	Hallo? Clara?

Clara	Hallo? Dad?


Biff	Clara? Clara! No…

Pauline	What a tragedy. The battery's dead. 

Biff	Hallo?

Clara	Dad's snowed in with Pauline. 

Gavin	Oh, poor him. And with Pauline as well.

Clara	So he won't be back until tomorrow. 

Clara	Gavin! We can do it, right? 

Gavin	Yes! It! Uh… what? 

Clara	We can make Christmas at Cattle Hill! 

Gavin	Yeah.

Clara	Think how great it'll be. We can give Dad the best Christmas ever. 

Gavin	We can ask Uncle Baart for help.

Gavin	He's Mr.Christmas around here.

Clara	Yes, that's a great idea.

Gavin	He's got some fairy lights up in the attic. 

Clara	Yeah! And we can...

Chickolina	Baart? Baart? 

Baart	There. That's it… Yes? 

Chickolina	Baa..baa Baart?

Chickolina	Are you hanging up Angel Root? 

Baart	No, this is mistletoe. 

Baart	Number 84, that is. It's my favourite. 

Baart	Maybe a suitable ewe will show up this year

Baart	And if we end up under it together, well…

Chickolina	Hallo? Baart?

Chickolina	Baart?

Chickolina	You and your strange traditions, Baart. 

Baart	What's that?

Baart	Ugh. I get nauseous so easily. 

Chickolina	The scent of sandalwood.

Baart	This smells of sweaty feet and dingleberries, or rotten eggs or something. 

Chickolina	Oh no. It's good for the soul, Baart

Baart	Good for the soul, maybe. But not for the nostrils. 

Chickolina	Yeah, yeah.

Baart	This smells of chicken that's gone off.

Gavin	Uncle Bart! Will you help us? 

Baart	With what? 

Baart	Hallo?

Baart	With what?

Clara	We're going to decorate Cattle Hill for Christmas. Surprise Dad. 

Baart	Now? 

Gavin + Clara	Yes! 

Baart	Hahaha, you've got to be out of your minds!

Baart	Coming here two days before Christmas, saying you want to get things ready now??

Baart	Just think about what today's called

Baart	Tiny Little Christmas Eve? And there are only two days to Christmas.

Baart	Oh, help!

Baart	I have so much to fix up and get ready here. 

Baart	Chickolina!

Baart	No alien elements on my Christmas tree, thank you.

Clara	But...

Gavin	I can help you!

Baart	No, Gavin. You have to be here! We have to complete number 75.

Baart	Empty the latrine bucket.

Baart	With all the clementines you're going to be stuffing your face with

Baart	You know you're going to need an empty bucket.

Gavin	I can come and help you tomorrow. 

Clara	Yeah. OK.

Clara	I can make a brilliant Christmas for my Dad all by myself. 

Clara	Just imagine how happy Dad's going to be when he comes back home to a proper Christmas atmosphere. 

Clara	Right then, I've decorated Mum's shop, so I can do this as well. 

Clara	What do I need?

Clara	A great big tree, out in the yard. Which has to be chooped down and carried. 

Clara	Fairy lights.. Which have to be strung from the roof. 

Clara	Oh no, I can't do this by myself. 

Clara	Yes!

Clara	The Gnome helps Dad with the farm.

Clara	So I'm sure he'll help me too. 

Clara	Dad is going to be so proud of me 

Clara	It's going to be just fantastic! 

Clara	There!

Clara	OK. Mhm. Aha.

Clara	Yes, that one.

Clara	Decorate Christmas tree!

Clara	OK. And that one.

Clara	(sings) Baparapa!

Clara	Mr. Gnome?

Clara	I've brought you some porridge. 

Clara	Mr. Gnome! Time for some Christmas porridge! Gnome! 

Clara	I'll set it down here. Like that. 

Clara	Mr. Gnome?

Clara	Don't be frightened.

Clara	I'm not dangerous. 

Clara	If you help me, you can have as much porridge as you want. 

Clara	Yes.

Nisse	Porridge.

Pauline	I've discovered I like those baroque style Christmases.

Pauline	It strikes the richest seasonal tone.

Pauline	He's fun, isn't he? Isn't he, Biff?

Pauline	Biff, I've had an idea. 

Pauline	Why don't we just spend Christmas here? You and me?

Biff	No. I have to get off home. 

Pauline	But it's so boring just sitting here, watching you dig. 

Pauline	We can play charades. Yatzy. We can play poker!

Pauline	For money! Lots of money! You can borrow some from me. 

Pauline	Biff? Do you want to come and see my Christmas decoration? 

Biff	Huh?

Gavin	Wow!

Gnome	Porridge.

Gavin	Clara?

Clara	Hi, Gavin!

Gavin	Hi!

Gavin	Did you do all this?

Clara	Yep!

Gavin	Wow!

Clara	Jump on!

Gavin	Where are we going?

Clara	To find a Christmas tree, of course!

Clara	All aboard! The Christmas Tree Express is ready to depart! 

Gavin	OK, but not too fast, then. 

Gavin	We're going in there, OK? 

Gavin	Golly.

Gnome	Look! Look!

Clara	Look!

Gavin	It's a bit steep. 

Clara	Yes, it's over here. 

Gavin	Oh no, stop!

Gavin	You forgot to put brakes on it, didn't you? 

Clara	Gavin.

Gavin	Clara!

Clara	Yes?

Clara	No, you don't have to be scared. He's really nice. 

Gavin	Huh?

Clara	Come on out.

Clara	Gavin isn't dangerous.

Gavin	Wowsa!

Gavin	So it was he who helped you decorate the place? 

Clara	Yep!

Gavin	How did you manage that?

Clara	I made him porridge.

Gavin	Porridge? I don't think the Gnomes are supposed to have porridge before Christmas Eve. 

Gavin	Grandpa said that he shouldn't have too much. 

Gavin	Just one bowl a year. 

Clara	Gavin. One bowl? That's just a fairy tale.

Clara	I've been giving him porridge all day, me.

Clara	Looks like it's going all right. 

Gavin	Yes, but...

Gnome	Tree, tree

Clara	This is our tree

Gavin	Gosh. It's really great.

Clara	Wow! That's the best, most beautiful tree I've ever seen. 

Clara	Come on, let's decorate it!  

Biff	That's it for me.

Biff	I have to get out of here! 

Pauline	You can help me decorate a bit.

Biff	No!

Biff	No more digging. No more nagging about plastic trees or playing Happy Families.

Biff	No more complaining..

Biff	Pauline?

Pauline	Yes?

Biff	I'm stuck.

Pauline	I thought we weren't having any more complaining in here. 

Pauline	Eaten too many apple pies, then? 

Pauline	What? You get out through the flue, that's how. 

Clara	Good, Gavin. Cool! 

Gavin	Yahoo! Yeah!

Clara	Yeah!

Clara	Great!

Gavin	See, he's digging it! Hee hee hee… 

Gavin	Where did he get to? 

Gavin	Hey!

Clara	Yeah!

Gavin	Wohoo!

Gavin	Wow!

Clara + Gavin	Yeah! Woohoo!

Clara	Let's see now. Yes, this is porridge, right. 

Gnome	Porridge.

Clara	Shall we go inside and have some breakfast? 

Gnome	Porridge. Porridge.

Clara	Yes yes, you'll get some soon. 

Clara	Come on, Mr. Gnome.

Gnome	Porridge.

Clara	Let's see now…

Clara	Here you go.

Gnome	Porridge.

Gnome	Porridge.

Gnome	Porridge? 

Clara	Have you eaten it up already?

Gnome	Porridge?

Clara	No, you've had enough, now.

Clara	O dear.

Gnome	Porridge! Porridge.

Clara	Oh.

Gnome	Porridge!

Pauline	Whatever are you up to, Biff?

Pauline	are you supposed to be Santa?

Biff	Help me out of here.

Pauline	How on earth am I going to do that?

Biff	You'll have to pull.

Pauline	No, ugh. You'll have to pay for the cleaning.

Biff	What was that?

Pauline	Uh, what was what?

Biff	You've got a phone? And you didn't say anything?

Pauline	Well, yes?

Biff	Pauline?

Pauline	I only have a top-up card, so…

Biff	Give it here!

Gavin	What is itt?

Baart	Oh, goodness gracious!

Baart	I've received a letter.

Baart	Guess who's coming here today.

Gavin	Santa?

Baart	Hahaha! Sheds and Wildlife!

Baart	They're going to put Sætra on the cover!

Gavin	I'm off to see Clara now.

Baart	Sheds and Wildlife.


Gavin	So long, see you later.

Baart	You know, this is the biggest thing that's happened to me since... 

Baart	Is it even possible?

Baart	Christmastide, ho ho ho.

Baart	There's something about Christmas, Chickolina? Eh what?

Baart	When Christmastide decends upon us, as it were

Baart	What? Huh? Chickolina, what are you doing? 

Chickolina	It's Zumba, Baart.

Chickolina	It makes laying eggs so much easier. 

Baart	Hey, Gavin! Wait, I'm coming with you! 

Biff	Clara?

Clara	Dad?

Biff	How's it going?

Clara	It's all good here

Biff	What was that?

Clara	It's just Gavin, fooling around. 

Gnome	Porridge, porridge? Porridge porridge porridge. 

Clara	No no no no no no no, stop that.

Gnome	Porridge, porridge? Porridge porridge porridge. 

Clara	Bad!

Biff	Clara! What's going on?

Clara	Gavin knocked something over, that's all. 

Biff	Knocked?

Pauline	No no no, not that!

Biff	Clara? Hallo? Whatever is happening, Clara?

Pauline	No no no! No, wait! 

Pauline	Porridge! 

Biff	Nope, something crazy's going on at Cattle Hill. 

Pauline	Business as usual, in other words.

Biff	Pauline?

Pauline	Yes?

Biff	I need you to help me. 

Biff	I'll do anything 

Biff	If you'll help me out here. 

Pauline	Anything? 

Pauline	Well, as yet I don't have any plans for this evening. 

Biff	Huh?

Pauline	I don't want to impose, but... can I come and spend Christmas with you? 

Biff	Yes… OK, you can come and spend Christmas with us. 

Biff	If you just help me find a way to…

Pauline	Use your head, Biff!

Biff	Huh?

Pauline	I knew you were slow, but are you deaf as well?

Biff	That's enough.

Pauline	Oh you dumb ox, you! 

Biff	Pauline ...

Pauline	You drive like an old blind mouse. 

Biff	Enough, now!!

Pauline	Bravo! Your apple pies taste like snot!

Pauline	You stink of dung.

Pauline	That's settled then. Christmas Eve at Cattle Hill.  Vamos!

Pauline	Ah, we're free! We're free! Come on, Biff. We have a party to get to. 

Baart	You didn’t help me choose the tree.You weren’t there to help fill the stockings. 

Baart	That's two whole items you've missed.

Baart	So, you don't want to…?

Baart	What on earth has happened here? 

Baart	But it can't loook like this. Sheds and Wildlife won't…

Baart	They're going to eliminate Sætra.


Baart	Have you had a hand in this?

Gavin	We got some help from the Gnome.

Baart	The Gnome?

Gavin	Yes, the Gnome.

Gnome	Porridge.

Clara	No, you've eaten up all the porridge. There isn't any left! 

Gnome	More!

Clara	You can have a carrot and a glass of cold milk.

Gnome	Porridge! Porridge!

Clara	Wait!

Baart	How did you manage this? Did the Gnome do everything? 

Gavin	Yes! The Gnome is really nice, and he…

Gavin	He helps with....

Gavin	Oh… we're best friends.

Gnome	Porridge, porridge. 

Clara	Stop!

Gavin	I mean it, he's really nice!

Clara	No no no.

Clara	No no. There's no porridge out there! Stop! 

Clara	There now, that's it. Come to Clara.

Gnome	Porridge!

Clara	No!

Baart	Where's the little beast got to, then? 

Chickolina	Oh. Ayeee, caramba.

Gnome	Porridge. Porridge, porridge! 

Chickolina	Hallo? Baart? Baart?

Gnome	Porridge, porridge, porridge, porridge! Porridge. Now! 

Chickolina	Aaagh, the Moon Man! 

Clara	He's a real cheeky Gnome. 

Baart	So. You've gone and created a Rampaging Gnome. 

Baart	What have you done? 

Clara	I haven't done anything. I've given him a bit of porridge, that's all. 

Baart	How much? 

Clara	Just two or three.

Baart	What, spoonfuls?

Clara	Er, no, pots.

Baart	Do you realise what you've done?

Chickolina	Baart! Come back!

Pauline	Didn't they take it?

Biff	No...

Pauline	Can you at least try the tractor?

Biff	If you can get it to start, then…  

Pauline	What are we going to do? We'll have to walk, then. 

Biff	Uh no. Maybe we can call. And hope it's not too late… 

Karen	Ah, typical. OK, then. Yes, wait up! I'm coming.

Karen	Earth to Table. Welcome. 

Pauline	I am not terribly impressed with the transport you've laid on, Biff. 

Pauline	I think you should give it two stars. 

Karen	If you don't shut up now, then… 

Pauline	Look out!

Ernie	Whoa, whoa. That was a close one.

Pauline	I'm stuck. Hallo?

Ernie	Smile!

Ernie	Is this the way to Sætra?

Biff	Uh, yes.

Ernie	Room for one more? 

Pauline	Help me up. I can't move. Don't stop. Biff!

Biff	Well, I think we can squeeze one more in. Right, Pauline? 

Pauline	Oh, I have to pee, I have to. I have to pee. 

Pauline	No, it was just gas. I can't move. Biff! 

Baart	Chickolina? No, look! No, that as well!!

Chickolina	What is it?

Baart	No… look!

Chickolina	It was the Moon Man.

Baart	No that wasn't any Moon Man. 

Chickolina	Yes it was!

Baart	It was the Gnome! Clara gave him an overdose of porridge.

Clara	I'm sorry, Baart.

Clara	I was just trying to decorate the place forn Christmas. I didn't know the Gnome was  going to wreck everything. 

Baart	What am I going to do now?

Baart	Sheds and Wildlife will be hear any minute! My life is over! ##

Chickolina	No, Baart, calm down. Have a crystal.

Baart	We have to get rid of the Gnome.

Chickolina	There there, there, now…

Baart	We have to chase him away 

Baart	Before he wipes us all out. 

Gavin	But Uncle, if the Gnome leaves, then..

Clara	There won't be a farm.

Baart	There's not much of a farm left, right now. 

Clara	What have I done? 

Clara	OK, we have to find him and get him to stay on the farm.

Clara	He's Cattle Hill's Gnome. Our Gnome. And he always will be. 

Chickolina	Yeah!

Gavin	Yeah!

Baart	So, what's the plan?

Clara	Shush! Quiet. I think he's in the barn. 

Chickolina	Baart, I didn't know you played hockey?  

Baart	Oh, I blat a puck around now and then.

Clara	Look, Gavin. Look. 

Baart	No actually I was trying for the circuit, but it didn’t work out that well. I missed a shot and hit someone with my stick. Then I got a back injury...

Clara	What's that?

Clara	Not good. It's his spoon.

Baart	Shush! 

Baart	Well, here comes Biff now. In the nick of time, tee hee… 

Baart	Get out of here!

Gnome	Porridge! 

Gavin	We have to get away.

Gavin	Uncle Baart, run for the barn! 

Baart	The Gnome!

Chickolina	Baart! Oh, Baart. 

Baart	Where is he? 

Gnome	Porridge!

Clara	No, no, no, no! 

Clara	No!

Gnome	Porridge! Porridge! Porridge!

Gnome	Porridge! Porridge! Porridge! Porridge! Porridge! Porridge! Porridge! Porridge!

Clara	Stop, stop, stop, stop! There's nothing out there. There's nothing left. Listen!

Gnome	Porridge!

Clara	No! No, no, no! Not the tree!

Gnome	Tree!

Clara	Stop him!

Clara	No...

Baart	What? No, how…?...

Baart	No! Leave that alone. It has to… No!  

Clara	No no no no! 

Clara	No!

Baart	Where did it get to? There it is.

Gnome	Porridge, porridge, porridge.

Gnome	Porridge, porridge. Porridge? 

Baart	That's it. Just stay there. Don't move. 

Gnome	Porridge. Porridge? 

Clara	Are you all right? 

Clara	Mr. Gnome, I'm sorry. I didn't know that… .

Gnome	Porridge.

Clara	All this isn't your fault. It's mine. 

Gnome	Porridge, porridge. Porridge. 

Clara	Mr. Gnome? Mr. Gnome, no.

Gnome	Leaving.

Clara	Don't leave. You belong at Cattle Hill. We need you here.

Gnome	Leaving.

Clara	Mr. Gnome? Oh No...  

Clara	We have to go and look for him. Shall we go and look for him? 

Biff	What on earth

Karen	Goodness. What has happened here?

Ernie	Oh my goodness me.

Pauline	You've been decorating the place?

Baart	Do you think he'll be back again? Did he get upset? I don't quite get it. He disappeared behind here, didn't he? 

Biff	Clara?

Clara	Dad! Mum! 

Karen	My little calflet.

Biff	What… What's happened here, Clara? 

Clara	I've ruined everything. 

Clara	I hust wanted to make a really great Christmas for you, and now the Gnom has disappeared, and…

Clara	…I've ruined the whole of Christmas for everyone. 

Biff	It’s all right, sweetheart. The main thing is that you're fine. 

Biff	Where is the Gnome now? 

Clara	He… he ran off. 

Baart	Well, there won't be a Christmas. That Clara, she's wrecked everything. 

Biff	Oh come now, she didn't mean to. Everyone can make mistakes. 

Baart	Yes, but some farms make more mistakes than others.

Biff	Yeah, yeah. Will you relax, Baart? 

Baart	Relax?

Biff	This is going to be just fine.

Baart	And how that going to happen, do you suppose?

Baart	You can't possibly have a farm without a Gnome. 

Chickolina	No.

Gavin	I have an idea. 

Gavin	He likes music.

Clara	He does?

Baart	He likes music? 

Gavin	Yes, he danced around like a flamingo when he heard that song. 

Baart	A flamingo?

Clara	Yes! We have to play for him. 

Baart	Play for him? 

Gavin + Chickolina	Yes!

Clara	Let's play your new song! 

Baart	My song?

Clara	Gavin…

Gavin	OK.

Clara	Gavin

Gavin	I've only spent half an hour on it, though. 

Baart	Haven't you been practising?

Clara+Biff+Chick+Kari	Baart! 

Biff	What do you need, Gavin? 

Gavin	All the instruments we can lay our hands on. 

Clara	Come on!

Gavin	Uncle Baart, you must fetch your fiddle! 

Chickolina	I can go and get my accordion!

Baart	Chickolina, I need a G string. Do you have a new one? 

Ensemble	(Song) "Shining Star"

Gnome	Go... Go... Go...

Gnome	Home

Pauline	Look out!

Pauline	And I can hold that note for much longer…

Chickolina	Have a crystal.

Clara	The Gnome!

Clara	Just wait a moment. How are you doing? 

Clara	Thank you for coming back. This is where you belong. This is your home. Here, at Cattle Hill. 

Gnome	Home.

Gnome	Porridge?

Clara	Oh no, not again.

Clara	Huh?

Clara	I think you’ve had enough porridge this year.

Ernie	Is that…?.

Pauline	Yes. I think that's a hippie. 

Ernie	Ah, brilliant.

Baart	What are you doing? 

Ernie	Oh, just going around  taking some photos for Sheds and Wildlife. 

Baart	What?

Ernie	Well, I was going to go to Sætra, but this is much more exciting.

Baart	No, no…

Baart	Tell me you're joking. 

Ernie	And smile…

Baart	Nooo…!

Baart	No. Stop. Stop. No.

Ernie	Nope, I be off, so we can get this to press.

Baart	But…

Ernie	Merry Christmas.

Baart	Oh no. No, stop. Stop. 

Baart	89 items and all in vain. 

Gavin	It's fine, Uncle Baart. There'll be another Chrsitmas next year.

Baart	No, no, no!

Baart	Noooo!

Karen	Whoa….!

Chickolina	Baart, calm down. Have a crystal! 

Clara	Christmas has offically started! 

Biff	Well, let's get the farm fixed up for a proper Christmas Party! 

Biff	You're excused. You've done more than enough for this year. 

Biff	Right, but first we have to tidy up. 

Gavin	We need to sort the instruments out, but they'll have to stay where they are until we get home. 

Clara	And Gavin's composed so many new songs. And they're Christmas songs. Loads of Christmas songs.  You can play those, Gavin.

Baart	Brrr, it's too cold to wait..

Ernie	We at Sheds and Wildlife have always thought that Christmas is special.

Ernie	It should be beautiful, and bring that Christmas feeling to all of us.

Ernie	But a visit to Cattle Hill has made me ask the question, what is it that’s beautiful?

Ernie	What gives that Christmas feeling?

Ernie	Is it the decorations we put up?

Ernie	All the traditions we follow to create that Christmas feeling?

Baart	There. Like that. Awesome!

Chickolina	Baartt! Maintenant, je joue de la guitare.

Ernie	From what I’ve just experienced, it doesn’t matter that much if the tree is decorated, or broken in two.

Ernie	Because when all’s said and done, Christmas means nothing if you can’t share it with the people you’re fond of.

Biff	Kari!

Ernie	And if you can do that, then the tree can fall over, the baubles can get smashed, and the food burned....

Karen	Ah, this is so nice and cosy. When you were little, we used to celebrate Christmas in here. 

Ernie	For Christmas comes around every year, and the Christmas they are having at Cattle Hill showed me that all one needs are good friends and family...

Biff	Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ernie	.And to never forget that the Gnome can only eat one portion of porridge

Clara	Mr. Gnome? It's Christmas! 

Ernie	And he has to have it on Christmas Eve.

Chickolina	Christmas Eve. Baart my dear, this is nice. 

Baart	What?

Baart	No!

Baart	Good heavens, why did they use that photo of me?

Baart	I don't exactly look much like a ewe magnet now.

Baart	This is going to be the worst Christmas ever. 

Chickolina	Baart?

Baart	Yes?

Chickolina	We have to go now. They're waiting for us.

Baart	Yes. 

Chickolina	Oh. 

Chickolina	Yuck. That tasted of lamb stew.

Baart	Made me want an omelette.

Chickolina	Oh, that was weird.

Baart	Christmas just got a bit better.

Baart	Hey, Chickolina. It was written down. We had to do it. 

Chickolina	Yeah, sure. But next year we can have Kwa-kwa-kwanza.

Clara	Thanks a million for your help, Gavin. 

Karen	How nice you've made it in here! 

Biff	Isn't it?

Gavin	There. Yes, there!

Chickolina	Ho ho

Biff	Hi there!

Gavin	Hei, Chickolina

Clara	Chickolina!

Gavin	Uncle Baart, you can sit here! 

Chickolina	Here you go, Clara. I've put  I’ve put an appetite crystal on it. That will help.

Clara	Have you fixed it?

Gavin	Great. 

Biff	Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas.

Gavin	I was thinking I should apply to that Paul McCartney school. 

Baart	Well, I sqaw the cover of Sheds and Wildlife. 

Baart	It's the next best photo, but it's brought results. I've already had messages from some ewes. 

Gnome	Porridge.

Clara	He's Cattle Hill's Gnome. 

Gnome	Porridge.

Clara	And he always will be. 

Pauline	Hey, tell me, weren't we supposed to be celebrating Chrtistmas here. I'm ravenous as a pig.

Pauline	I'm just getting started.

Pauline	My blood sugar. Is that it? I could eat an ox. And you Biff, could eat a whole one. 

Karen	It'll be exciting to se who gets the almonds in the porridge.

Clara	Me! Me! I never get it. 

Pauline	I'll have that. Thanks. Thanks for that.

Biff	Merry Christmas! 

Clara	Merry Christmas! 

Baart	Merry Christmas! 

Gavin	Merry Christmas! 

Pauline	Yeah, right. Merry Christmas!

Chickolina	Kwa-Kwa-Kwanza!


Pauline	Is there any more porridge? I didn't mean that ox thing, Biff. Have a bit more. Thanks. 

Karen	Oh, this is nice!

Gavin	Are you going to have something, Uncle Baart? 

Clara	Dad! 

Karen	And now it'll be New Year soon, and I haven't changed my tyres. Stupid of me. How can I be so dumb? 

Karen	I'll just have to remember to do it next year.  Can't you remind me, Biff? Or you, Clara? 

Karen	Clara, tell me in July, "Time to change your tyres". You can do that. I think you should. 

Karen	I've fitted my winter tyres. Is that a bit much, Biff? Winter tyres?
