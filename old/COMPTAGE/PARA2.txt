(PARADISE HILLS 2)




TECHNICIAN 2	Your gloves, please.

UMA	It's a little tight.

TECHNICIAN 1	It's for your safety. Please.

TECHNICIAN 2	Sorry about that. We're attempting to resolve some technical issues. Please, hang tight.

SON	Lowers like to say all kinds of things about me...but the truth is, I'm a simple man. I work hard...and I give back. I may be a sensitive guy...but don't let anyone tell you I don't know how to have a good time. Maybe my idea of fun can be a bit extreme...but, in both business and life...what's the point of dreaming small? Lowers like to say all kinds of things about me...

UMA	Okay. I get it.

SON	...but the truth is...I'm a simple man.

UMA	I get it!

SON	I work hard...and I give back.

UMA	Hello?

SON	But the truth is, I'm a simple man.

UMA	Can you turn it off?

SON	I work hard.

UMA	Please.

SON	But the truth is...anyone tell you I don't know how to have a good time. Lowers like to say all kinds of things...I'm a simple man, but... Maybe my idea of fun can be a bit extreme...I may be a sensitive guy. I may be a sensitive guy...sensitive guy.

TECHNICIAN 2	We're so sorry. The system failed.

TECHNICIAN 1	We couldn't stop the projection remotely.

TECHNICIAN 2	The infirmary will patch those up.

TECHNICIAN 1	We're so sorry.

UMA	You really think that stupid video is gonna get me to change my mind?

DUCHESS	Oh, honey. Let me take a look at those hands. Come here. Perhaps he is a bit heavy-handed. He means well.

UMA	Means well? He's a sociopath. Besides, it doesn't matter. I'm in love with somebody else.

DUCHESS	Your mother never told me about anyone else.

UMA	Of course not. He's a Lower, so he basically doesn't exist to her.

DUCHESS	Your father was not a good influence, Uma. Look at me. I have dedicated my whole life to taking care of Mother's little garden. But you, if you could learn your place...you have your best years ahead of you. Don't end up like me. So sad! Would you like to help me clip some thorns?

CHLOE	So, your ma just likes him 'cause he's rich?

UMA	She's an Upper, but we're broke. She thinks the marriage will save our family.

YU	That sucks. I'm sorry, dude.

UMA	Am I the only one getting married off here?

YU	I wish all I had to do was marry some rich guy.

UMA	You don't mean that.

CHLOE	Well, my video was people just joggin' and eatin', like, celery. I mean, if it was that easy, everyone would look like Amarna.

AMARNA	Why, thank you, Chloe.

YU	Screw this.

CHLOE	No, hey. ? Here, let me help.

YU	I can't do this. I just can't.

CHLOE	No. What'd they show you in there?

YU	It was a documentary about my thing. I get anxious. Like panic-attack anxious. I feel like I'm dying when I have one. My parents are Lowers. They sent me to Beijing to live with my aunt and uncle. Big shot Uppers. But I just don't know how to act around them. I don't know how to be. I embarrass them. So, they sent me here and told me not to come back until I got better.

CHLOE	Hey, you're not like the other Lowers. You got a choice now.

YU	Yeah, well, maybe my idea of success isn't stepping on everyone below me.

UMA	There, there, my little tapioca pudding. You're in our brave new world now.

AMARNA	We know you've suffered, my peanut, but don't you worry. You most surely will be redeemed...by an excellent hairstyle and a truly mediocre personality.

YU	I hate you guys.

AMARNA	Come on.

CHLOE	Hey!

AMARNA	So, when you go back to Beijing, you're gonna form what?

YU	Sammy. Sammy and the Decapitated Head Horses.

CHLOE	Charming.

AMARNA	Wait, who's Sammy?

YU	I'm Sammy. I formed the band, so...

CHLOE	Wait, you're singin'?

YU	Amarna sings. I do this.

CHLOE	That ain't music!

YU	(SINGING) Yeah, Chloe doesn't like it Thinks it's too crass But she don't know shit Got her head up her ass

CHLOE	Real funny.

YU	Give me my headphones.

DUCHESS	My dearests...the sun is rising.

AMARNA	She visited me the first time the album went platinum.

UMA	We went swimming. Just the two of us. It was a beautiful, clear day... but the current was just too strong.

AMARNA	I told her I was not gonna leave with her. I was gonna stay. She said, "Whatever you want, I want for you."

UMA	She started getting pulled under the waves. I... managed to get her back to shore...and I just wrapped my arms around her.

AMARNA	I wish she meant it. I wish she meant it with every part of my life.

UMA	I was terrified of losing her. Terrified of just being... completely alone.

AMARNA	At that time... those words were just... enough.

UMA	That was the last time I told her I loved her.

AMARNA	...the last time I told her I loved her.

DUCHESS	Very good, Uma. I'm proud of you.

CHLOE	Nice. Now you twist the ends together like this.

AMARNA	When I leave this place...I'm gonna go somewhere far, far away from here. I just wanna be somewhere where I can...start all over again...where nobody really knows who I am. What about you?

UMA	I told you, I'm in love with someone. We just want to be together... and have a simple life.

CHLOE	Uma, isn't that a memory locket?

UMA	It's the prototype for all the rest.

CHLOE	They still make them?

UMA	Not the way my dad used to. How did you...?

MARKUS	I promised I'd find you.

UMA	How did you even find me?

MARKUS	Showed up at your mother's place. She was not happy to see me.

UMA	What did she say?

MARKUS	That you were getting ready to marry Son.

UMA	Look, I'm not marrying him. I told her that.

MARKUS	I know, I know. I applied for the job as soon as I could. Listen, Uma. I'm gonna get you off this island. No. Not here. Swiped this from the tech guys. The feed will just show an empty room, same as before. Listen. I'm gonna join the cargo crew. And when I do, I'll sneak you into the hold. We'll fly to the mainland and I'll get you off that plane.

UMA	And go where?

MARKUS	We'll figure it out. As long as we're together. Is that what you want, too?





CHLOE	What? That is so romantic! I mean, he came all this way for you?

YU	Just in time to save you from that shit-stick you're supposed to marry.

AMARNA	Uma doesn't need saving.

UMA	He's gonna help me escape.

AMARNA	You just have to be nice to the staff, fake the treatments. You don't need to escape.

UMA	I finally have a partner in all of this.

AMARNA	And what am I? You shouldn't trust that guy, Uma.

UMA	I've known him my entire life.

AMARNA	Well, I don't think he deserves you.

UMA	How would you know?

GYM-KARAOKE	Amarna! You're up, girl!

CHLOE AND YU	Go, Amarna!

AMARNA	Stop the music, please. I'm yours to keep, your servant I'll cater to you, all your needs Counting all your sins One by one As you hold my stolen heart Our lies ignite the fire Our flames are burning higher What is this incantation? You were my salvation Everything I need  Everything I need 

AMARNA	What is this incantation?

GYM KARAOKE	All right, all right. That's enough, now.

AMARNA	You were my salvation

GYM KARAOKE	Amarna?

AMARNA	Everything I need

GYM KARAOKE	Amarna! Hello? I said that's enough!

AMARNA	Everything I need

GYM-KARAOKE	Bedtime, mesdemoiselles.

RESIDENT GIRLS	No!

RESIDENT GIRL	Go away!

GYM-KARAOKE	Offstage, go. Listen, I don't want to repeat it. Just go.


CHLOE	Just once...can she play some shit that isn't, like, 100 years old?

UMA	Have you seen my necklace? My locket?

CHLOE	No.

MALE P.A.	Security perimeter breach. Security perimeter breach.

MALE P.A.	Interfering boat type 0-0-1-2.

CHLOE	Look at these clowns.

MALE P.A.	Male subject. All safety personnel to Beach A3. Interns are to initiate regular morning activities. Security instructions will...

ASSISTANT 1	Girls! The showers! Now! Come on, mesdemoiselles, move it!

MALE P.A.	Please, resume standard procedures. Repeat, perimeter breach. 

CHLOE	What's that boat doing here?

UMA	No clue.

DUCHESS	It's unacceptable. Who is this intruder? Fetch him. Fetch him at once! Why are you still here? Go and wash yourselves!

UMA	Whose boat is that?

DUCHESS	Are you deaf?

UMA	Well, I was just asking whose boat...

DUCHESS	Okay, get out of here. Go, go, go. Come on. Come on.

YU	Hey! Back off!

DUCHESS	What did you say?

YU	I said back off.

UMA	Yu!

DUCHESS	Don't you ever touch me again. I will send you home to your family a failure, a disgrace. Is that what you want? Is it?

AMARNA	Enough. Stop. I said stop! If she leaves, we all leave. You hear me?

CHLOE	Yeah. We'll tell everybody about this.

DUCHESS	I am so sorry. I lost my composure. We are dealing with a situation this morning. Thank you so much for helping me. Find him. And turn off this ridiculous alarm.

UMA	It's okay. Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe.

CHLOE	It's okay.

UMA	Okay.

RESIDENT GIRL 1	Look, there he is.

RESIDENT GIRL 4	The mystery man.

RESIDENT GIRL 1	He ran the boat straight into the rocks like he wanted to crash.

RESIDENT GIRL 2	She interrogated him herself. I can't even imagine.

RESIDENT GIRL 4	I heard he wanted to see Amarna. That he demanded an audience.

RESIDENT GIRL 2	A superfan.

RESIDENT GIRL 1	A super creep.

AMARNA	So, the attendant that gets me the cigs lets me use his station... in exchange for passes to my comeback show.

UMA	That guy sailed all the way here to see you?

AMARNA	Not exactly.
