(KICKBOXER)




Kurt	You speak English?

Kavi	(  )

Kurt	Kru Po, he teaches you, right? Listen, I want to train with Kru Po. I have cash. I just wanna train. What the hell, man?

Kavi	I can't take you to Kru Po, if you have no skills. Hey! Prove it!

Storm	Kavi fights better when he's drunk.

Fighter	He's so drunk it's almost a fair fight.

Kavi	He's very fast.

Fighter	No, you're very slow.

Kavi	Thank you. I just lost my position of doorman.

Kurt	You started it.

Kavi	What?

Kurt	You attacked me.

Kavi	I come a long way. I wanna train with Tong Po. I wanna train with master Po.

Kurt	Put it back! And the money... You know what? Keep it.

Kavi	All of it?

Kurt	Yeah. You need it more than I do.

Crawford	You fighters from around the world have been invited to train with Master Po and witness the impossible. Now you might think that Master Po has run out of the unthinkable, but he likes to challenge himself and stay creative and continue to inspire you all with infinite imagination. Check it out! The universe is composed of particles  which are subjected to the power of the focused, quiet mind. Again I say, “Check it out”! Can I get an “Amen!”? That's what I'm talking about. The fight will begin, unless, first someone wants to challenge Master Po. You mean to tell me there's nobody here batshit crazy enough to go a couple of rounds with the master? Can I get another “Amen!”? Let's fight. The next round, we will add weapons.

Tong Po	Did you come here to kill me? Sloane. Your brother was brave. Your brother was a warrior. Unlike you, such a coward...You come to my home with a gun to kill me in my sleep.

Narrative Title	ONE YEAR EARLIER

Kurt	Ladies and gentlemen, my brother, Eric Sloane, World Champion!

Eric	Come on, you do it.

Kurt	We're gonna do this?

Eric	Absolutely.

Kurt	Alright. One more time. One more time. Ready.

Eric	I need a drink.

Marcia	I want some wine.

Eric	Oh, look who it is. What brings you to this side of town?

Marcia	Here to see the fabulous Eric Sloane

Eric	You look great.

Marcia	Thank you. You've made quite the name for yourself.

Eric	Oh, I'm working on it.

Marcia	Almost a modern day warrior.

Eric	Almost.

Marcia	I heard you won the gold.

Eric	Yeah. I did.

Marcia	So, what's next?

Eric	I don't know... expand the gym a little, get some new equipment.

Marcia	I have an idea.

Eric	I bet you do, but you'll have to talk to Kurt. He's my manager, now, as well as my trainer.

Marcia	Always looking out for baby brother, I love that about you.

Eric	Taking care of him? You're kidding me. He takes care of me. This kid always pushes me in the right direction and pulls me with no strings attached, unlike some people in this game.

Marcia	Hm. Right. So, who wants to go to Thailand?

Eric	Jesus, can't you give a guy a moment of victory? We're havin' a party here.

Marcia	I'm talking immortality.

Eric	Immortality?

Marcia	No rules. No ref. Just you're wit and skill to keep you alive.

Kurt	What do you mean, “no rules”?

Eric	Wait, I've heard about these underground fights over there, but what's in it for us?

Marcia	Well 200K, right now, and 200, when you land, with the chance to be remembered for a lifetime.

Eric	Alright, now we're talking. Keep going.

Marcia	I've got this fighter by the name of Tong Po. The undefeated Muay Thai champ, and I think you can take him and make us all a ton of cash while doing so.

Eric	Kurt, you wanna go to Thailand?

Kurt	You know what? Let's talk about it later. Let's have a drink! It's a party! Just don't let her get into your head.

Eric	It's not her getting into my head. Have you seen this kind of cash before? We could buy this place, set up a life.

Marcia	Eric, if you decline, it's OK. It's not for everyone.

Kurt	She comes in, looks at you, smiles at you and you fall into her trap? She's a crook!

Eric	She's a fight promoter, Kurt. They're all crooks. Our job is to get as much cash from them as we can while I'm on top.

Kurt	You don't know what you're walking into.

Eric	Jesus Christ, Kurt you drive me crazy with all this. That Thai champ should be worried about me. I'm a badass! You know that? Stop being a coward.

Kurt	I'm looking out for you and your career.

Eric	No, stay here and do what you do best: Just worry.

Kurt	You really think you can take the Thai champ at his sport. Are you that arrogant?

Eric	Well, I know you don't. So, I guess I'll be doing this alone. Thanks for the party.

Kurt	You're just gonna walk away?

Eric	I'm walking toward a future.

Narrative Title	TWO MONTHS LATER

Megan	Hey Kurt! Kurt!

Kurt	Great! Good job. What?

Megan	You got something from Eric.

Kurt	He's fighting in a week. His gold medal? I gotta go to Thailand. Get up! Come on! Eric! Eric!

Liu	It was murder! It was an illegal underground fight! A fight to the death. He was down and then Tong Po killed him. A fight to the death.

Wattona	My people didn't see anything. They were being blocked.

Liu	Well they weren't really looking. Go get the witness statements.

Clerk	I have to wait for the boss's orders.

Wattona	Watch yourself...




Liu	I'm so sorry.

Marcia	Kurt...

Kurt	You set him up.

Marcia	We got him the best trainer. He trained his ass off. Eric knew what he was getting himself into. Sometimes these things just happen.

Kurt	You killed him! This is on you, all on you!

Marcia	(  ) I'm just gonna say goodbye, and then I'll leave.

Wattona	Take him into my office. Put him on a plane back to the United States. The prize money is with his brother's trainer.

Eric	Taking care of him? You're kidding me. He takes care of me. This kid always pushes me in the right direction and pulls me with no strings attached.

Kurt	Who's this?

Police Officer	I think this is you're brother's trainer. I think he may have something for you. (   )

Durand	Do you mind? I'm training him. ( )

Police Officer	Are you Durand?

Durand	Yes, I am.

Police Officer	This is Eric's brother.

Durand	Here, this is Eric's fee for his fight. He wanted you to have this, if anything happened to him, and, of course, it did.

Kurt	You're making a joke.

Durand	Do I look like I'm laughing?

Kurt	You trained my brother Muay Thai?

Durand	Yes, I did.

Kurt	Why would you let him fight that monster?

Durand	I train people. Don't tell them when to fight and whom to fight.

Kurt	You didn't train him well enough, did you?

Durand	Please leave.

Police Officer	We have to go. Kurt! Let's go! I'm putting you on a plane out of the country. If you stay or come back, you will go to jail. You get it?

Crawford	 Oh, Mr. Sloane, we normally would welcome you to Master Po's humble home, but it's clear that you're here with dubious intentions. And when Micheal Corleone was sitting in the restaurant across from the two men who attempted to kill his father, many argue that he was wrestling with his conscience to whether or not he could kill them in cold blood. I, however, believe that the decision were made the night he visited his father and saw him barely alive in the hospital. He had no choice, really. He had to pull the trigger. And as for you, Mr. Sloane, all you had to do was pull the trigger.

Kurt	 I should have.

Underling	Master Po! The police are here.

Crawford	This man just broke in and tried to kill the Master.  Don't listen to him, he's a liar.

Liu	Thai Royal Police! He's coming with me. Take the handcuffs off! You're comin' with me.

Crawford	Leave. Follow them. See that they don't get where they're going.

Liu	By going after Tong Po like that, you made things very hard on yourself and on my investigation. You were the only eye witness willing to come forward and, now, your credibility is going to be questioned.

Kurt	Credibility?

Liu	I guess I should thank you for saving my life.

Kurt	I'm the one that put you there.

Liu	You know I have orders to arrest you.

Kurt	What about those guys in the street?
Liu	We'll take care of them. In the meantime your brother's trainer has agreed to shelter you here.

Durand	When did that happen?

Liu	It's just for a few days.

Kurt	Train me to fight Tong Po.

Durand	I failed Eric. What am I going to do with you?

Kurt	You're gonna help me make this right.

Durand	I will train you. We wake up at five. No coffee break.

Kurt	What's going on?

Durand	We've got to numb the nerves.

 Liu	Oh Lord! What are those from?

Kurt	Training.

Liu	What kind of training does that to you?

Kurt	Training with Durand.

Liu	Why are you putting yourself through that.

Kurt	When I'm training, when I'm in that place, the pain just turns my brain off. It's... I don't feel anything.

Durand	That's good. How do you feel?

Kurt	You're crazy.

Durand	I'm crazy? One more time!

Kurt	Give me a minute to catch my breath. Why would you do that?

Durand	You think Tong Po would give you a break? Splits? We have more to do.

Girl	You look tired.

Boy	Are you tired?

Girl	He gets tired so easy.

Boy	Why don't you rest?

Kurt	He won't let me!

Durand	Let's have a... coconut break.

Girl	Coconuts!

Boy	Coconut break!

Durand	You like coconuts?

Girl	You're supposed to try to crack open the coconuts.

Durand	Let me show you. Kurt!

Kurt	I'm ready, Durand.

Durand	You're ready?

Kurt	I am ready. See? I'm ready.

Durand	Oh. You think you're ready? Let's get a drink.

Joe King	Ah he was unlucky, wasn't he? Is there anyone who can beat my fighter? 5000 baht, if you can last two rounds, gets you 50000 baht! Anyone? Anyone? Master Durand, lovely to see you again, mate. Ah, you've brought me some more easy money now have you? Just messing with you! Joseph King by name, Jo-King by nature. A little stuck up this one, yeah? What can I do for you?

Durand	Two rounds.

Joe King	It's your funeral.

Kurt	5000: two rounds?

Durand	That's right.

Kurt	With him?

Durand	You're ready, no? This way.


Liu	Like I said before, just stay put. You cannot leave this compound. Like I said before, just stay put. You cannot leave this compound. Do you understand? It's just not safe for you out there.

Kurt	Just come by any time. I'll be right here.

Liu	Wait a second. You said he was in training. Training for what exactly?

Durand	I'm a trainer. That's what I do.

Liu	You stay away from Tong Po.

Durand	I'll keep him busy. Don't worry.

Liu	Then just stay put. Don't make me bring you an ankle bracelet.

Durand	Great distraction. Another distraction.

Kurt	What are you doing here?

Kavi	They kicked me out.

Kurt	He's from Tong Po's camp.

Durand	Please, come. Just go for a second. I need to talk to him. bWhy did you come here? Maybe you came here to get a reward from the cops, right? Or, maybe you came here because of your master, Tong Po.

Kavi	Look, Master Durand.

Durand	Yes.

Kavi	Maybe, maybe you should have trained Eric better.

Durand	Tell me the truth.

Kavi	OK. I work for Tong Po.

Durand	Now, you work for me and Kurt.

Kavi	How am I gonna get paid?

Durand	Your pay? You'll keep your teeth, laundry, stop drinking and start to train. You're good.



Kavi	Not impressed by your performance. Never going to win going back.

Durand	Tighter. Tighter. That's good. Come from the inside. Push up up the chin. Hands up. Break hard. If you're afraid to die in a fight with Tong Po, you're dead. I don't want to loose two sons. Tong Po's head.

Kurt	Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po! Come out, Tong Po! Tong Po, I challenge you to a fight!

Crawford	Storm! Master Po has gladly accepted your challenge. Be prepared. Master Po has gladly accepted your challenge.

Marcia	Eric's little brother wants revenge, a grudge match.

Liu	Did I miss anything?

Operator	The American has challenged Tong Po to fight.

Kurt	Tong Po! I challenge you to a fight!

Operator	We confirmed Marcia is putting on the fight. We just don't know where yet.

Marcia	Wattona  Darling! What seems to be the problem?

Wattona	You're place is compromised.

Marcia	Do you know what we could do with this information, knowing that she's listening? We could send her to a much better place for us.

Wattona	It's been her crusade for years. Without her, none of this would be happening.

Marcia	Without her... doesn't that sound ideal?

Wattona	You want it clean or messy?

Marcia	Make her an example.

Liu	We were set up! Did you tell anyone we were listening in on Marcia? You don't have to do this. This is for you're own good. You're both under arrest. You're a fugitive. You're harboring a fugitive.

Durand	Love and Muay Thai don't mix. So, you're girlfriend won't let you fight Tong Po.

Kurt	We have to get out of here.

Durand	OK.

Wattona	You have arrested Kurt Sloan and Durand. Release them. Now.

Liu	Weren't you the one who told me to arrest Kurt Sloan?

Wattona	Tong Po has dropped the charges and the Metro chief wants him released. My orders come from the Chief.

Liu	The orders came from Marcia's pocket. I'm doing my own investigation on police corruption. I'd be really careful if I were you.

Guard	Where's the other idiot?

Durand	Vous parlez français?

Bar Fighter	Hey, forgot about me?

Guard	Hey!

Durand	Sorry. Oops. Let's go.

Marcia	Just let everyone know that bets can be placed before the first round. No betting during fight time.

Crawford	The main strength in Muay Thai in not just it's destructive capacity. There are often 30 to 50 deaths in the ring, each year. One of these deaths occurred here, not so long ago, right here on this spot. Another will occur today, right here. Let's meet the challenger! Kurt Sloane: the brother of the last man who died by Tong Po's hand. His fury over the death of his brother has lead to one attempt at Tong Po's life. He wants revenge so much that he broke out of jail just to be here with us today and face his formidable enemy in mortal combat. Ladies and Gentlemen, the undisputed champion of all champions, the man who defies tho laws of physics, the man who is responsible for more than half the deaths in the ring, the last two years, usually in the first round. I give you Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po!

Durand	You know what to do. Don't think about anything else. That champions' amulet has been around his neck far too long. Now you have the spirit of Muay Thai in you, and he's going down.

Crawford	Fighters! The rounds will be progressive. Weapons will be added, chosen by me, but the first round is only on the eight points of contact.

Tong Po	Ready to die, tilak?

Kurt	After you.

Crawford	Back to your corners! Champion! Challenger! Fight!

Durand	Come on, get up.

Marcia	Is it done?

Stahl	Haven't heard back yet.

Marcia	Anyone betting on Kurt?

Stahl	Couple of guys went for the odds. There's about 3 mil on Tong Po.

Marcia	 I'll tell Po stretch it out to help even the odds.

Durand	Sit down. You're doing well.

Kurt	What fight are you watching?

Durand	That one. Come on. You're doing exactly what I want.

Crawford	Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! The challenger is still alive. So let's up the ante! Second stanza: glass. Place your bets.

Durand	Come on, get up! Up again! Are you alright?

Kurt	Not good.

Durand	Remember: he's just a man like you. His bones can break and he can bleed. Now, go in there and take that son of a bitch out! Who's going to win? Come on. Let's go.

Liu	You're under arrest

Marcia	Look. You should really check this out before you do something stupid. I've got some juice down in Metro.

Liu	Yeah I know all about it. It'll come out in the prosecution.

Marcia	I'll be out in a day




Crawford	I am in a state of shock. Kurt Sloane's heart is still beating. He's proven himself a worthy opponent for Master Po, and, with that, we move into our final round, and the weapons shall be our double swords. Death is imminent.

Durand	Get up. The sword. Get up!

Tong Po	Your brother was brave. Your brother was a warrior. Unlike you, such a coward...

Durand	If you're afraid to die in a fight with Tong Po, you're dead. I don't want to lose two sons.

Liu	You don't have to do this.

Durand	Come on.

Kavi	White Warrior!! White Warrior!!

Durand	You're a warrior. And he's going down. That's my boy!

Crowd	White Warrior!! White Warrior!!

Durand	Coconut! Coconut! Come on! Yeah!

Kurt	This is for Eric.

Durand	Ah. Hey!
