(DINO KING)
	
		
JUNIOR	Papa.

SPECKLES	Why did you run away?Those beasts are your prey.

JUNIOR	But, but I'm scared.

SPECKLES	You're a Tarbosaurus! You're a king. Do you see this, Junior? This is our land. I fought tooth and nail for this land. Soon, this will be yours. But as you are, you are not fit to be a king. As a Tarbosaurus, I refuse to have a toothless son. Tomorrow we hunt for real. If you get lost in a hunt, find the river. When you follow it, you will find your way back home. The most important thing about hunting is confidence. We're Tarbosaurus, born hunters, we're strong, we're the best. Never forget who you are. You're a Tarbosaurus. Just trust in yourself and be confident. Now, let's go. Get ready! Junior! Junior! No!

JUNIOR	Papa, help me, save me!

SPECKLES	Junior!

JUNIOR	Help, help, help me! Help me! Help!
	
SPECKLES	you call yourself a Tarbosaurus. You're a disgrace.

JUNIOR	I hate you. Papa, save me! Mama, mama! I miss you.

SPECKLES	Blue-Eyes. Life is so difficult now without you. I don't know how to raise a son. I know that I'm hard on him. I can't help it. How can I do this alone? Are you hiding in there again? You are incorrigible. When will you grow up?
	
JUNIOR	Dad, what's happening?

SPECKLES	As stars fall and mountains explode, the world will change.

JUNIOR	But, Dad, what will happen to us?

SPECKLES	We will have to look for a new place to live.

JUNIOR	Can't we just stay here for ever? I don't want to move again.

SPECKLES	Junior, this world is full of danger, but there are also wonderful and amazing things. If we stay, you can stay safe in the shadows, but you will miss out on all the good things life has to offer. Don't worry. Whatever happens, I will always protect you.

JUNIOR	Okay. Okay, I can do this. Ow, that hurt.
	
SLY	Hey there, where's your papa?

JUNIOR	My, My, My Dad is on his way.

SLY	Apparently his Papa is on his way. Isn't that cute?

TRAPPER	Hey, Ditto, isn't that cute?

DITTO	Hey, Ditto, isn't that cute?

TRAPPER	Hey, Ditto, I told you to stop copying me.

TRAPPER	Knuckleheads, he was asleep just a minute ago.

SLY	Oh you're useless. Shut up, you idiots! Let's go, take him!
	
SPECKLES	Junior!

SPECKLES	Junior!

SPECKLES	Junior. Junior. Hold on. I'm coming for you. What? No. Not rain. Junior's tracks are disappearing. So is his scent. No, Junior! Junior!
	
SLASH	Hey, Tarbo? Hey, are you scared?

JUNIOR	No.
	
BLUE	Cut it out! Leave the newbie alone. You're a big bully.

SLASH	Back off. And get out of my way!

BLADE	Stop it, Slash.

SLASH	Better watch your Back, kid. Blade! You see that? Did you see how scared he was? He couldn't even let out a squeal. He looks like a Tarbosaurus, but he's a big wimp.
	
JUNIOR	Um. Thank you. My name is Junior.

BLUE	I'm Blue. Hey, why didn't you fight back? Are you sure you're a Tarbo? Oh no, they're back!

JUNIOR	Huh?
	
TRAPPER	Let's get him! Haha, hey all of you, gather over here now.

DITTO	Get here now.

TRAPPER	I told you to Stop copying me, Ditto.

DITTO	I told you to Stop copying me, Ditto.
	
TRAPPER	Gather over here now!
	
DITTO	Gather over here now.

TRAPPER	Again, I told you to stop copying me, Ditto.

YOUNG DINOSAUR	No, no, not me, not me!

TRAPPER	How should I make My pick today?

YOUNG DINOSAUR	Oh no!
	
DITTO	this one is pretty. I like this one.

TRAPPER	Eenie, meenie, minie, moe. You two, come out! You two, come out!

BLUE	No, help me! No!
	
SLY	Wrap it up and get moving!

DITTO	Wrap it up and Get moving.
	
TRAPPER	Oh my God, seriously, I'm wasting my breath.

JUNIOR	What's going to happen to this guy?

TRAPPER	Hey, Can you be any slower?

BLUE	I don't know, no one's ever come back. So do whatever you can to stay under the radar.
	
SPECKLES	Junior.

SSAI	I found him. I can smell it on him. I can take him down. At least, I think I can. Revenge is mine!
	
SPECKLES	Hey.
	
SSAI	I can't.
	
SPECKLES	How dare you challenge me. You foolish herbivore.

SSAI	Yes, but you killed My best friend. You are my enemy.

SPECKLES	Why would I want to kill someone with skin as tough as yours.

SSAI	You lying!

SPECKLES	your armour is not worth the effort nor are you.

SSAI	Daisy was worth it. She was my best friend until you and your smelly friends took her.

SPECKLES	what are you talking about?

SSAI	She was. She was one of the special ones.

DAISY	Somebody help! Oh please, somebody help me!
	
DAISY	Ssai, help me! Ssai!

SSAI	Daisy! Daisy!

DAISY	Help me!

SSAI	Daisy! Daisy.
	
SSAI	I knew it was you. You took her. You are my enemy!

SPECKLES	Hey, are you blind or something? I'm over here.

SSAI	I can see, but only when it's close. Huh?

SPECKLES	look, look here, closely. You sure?

SSAI	Well, now, But I can smell something on you. You have the same scent as Daisy's killers, but. No, it's different, yes.

SPECKLES	How many do you think there were?

SSAI	Maybe three. No four, I'm not sure. Actually, one of them was quite small. I can tell by his scent he was young. And he smelled a bit like you.

SPECKLES	Sure?

SSAI	Well, My vision may be poor, but my smell is the best of all the dinos. My whole life not once have I been wrong.

SPECKLES	Then it's my boy, it must be him!

SSAI	Sure?

SPECKLES	Yes, My son, he smells like me.

SSAI	Oh, that poor kid.

SPECKLES	Hey, do you still think you can track them?
	
SSAI	This way! There's a faint smell going in this direction.

SPECKLES	Let's go.

SSAI	Who, me?

SPECKLES	Come with me. Help me find him.

SSAI	But you think he's still alive? Okay, okay, okay.

SPECKLES	I know he's still alive or why else would they have taken him away.

SSAI	But How could I possibly go with you? No way! What happens when you get hungry? You're a meat eater and I'm made of meat.

SPECKLES	I told you before, your skin is too tough.

SSAI	It's not.

SPECKLES	Don't you want to find the actual killers and avenge your best friend?

SSAI	Yes, they are my enemy!

SPECKLES	Excellent, Well then?

SSAI	Well, yes, let's do this.

SPECKLES	Okay.

SSAI	Yes, they're in trouble now! So you know, under my hard skin I promise I taste terrible, ask anyone. If you're hungry let me know and I'll find you some nice, green leaves, okay? Okay.

DINOSAUR	Hey, find your own cave, this cave's mine. Go!
	
DINOSAUR 3	Get out!

DINOSAUR 2	Don't ever come here again!
	
JUNIOR	Huh? Smells so bad.

DUSTY	you are hiding here too?
	
JUNIOR	what are you doing here?

DUSTY	It's safe here. They won't come in this stinky place.
		
BLUE	Hey, Tarbo boy! You're nothing, but a big chicken. Aren't you, Junior?

JUNIOR	Can't you just leave me alone? I didn't need your help anyway.

BLUE	Sure. What are you doing here anyway? Next to a huge pile of stinky poop.

JUNIOR	Waiting until I Can go home.

BLUE	We're never going home.

JUNIOR	I'll get out, you'll see.

BLUE	How? How do you think you'll do that? Fly out on a Pterodactyl? No one has ever gotten out of here. At least, well not alive anyway.

JUNIOR	My Dad will Come for me. I know he will.
	
SSAI	this way.

SPECKLES	Through the ravine?

SSAI	Yes, but I really don't like the smell of it.
SSAI	We should go around.

SPECKLES	We can't, we don't have time.

SSAI	Hey, I've got a bad feeling about this. You're so stubborn! We don't know what's in there! Speckles! You crazy apex predator! Speckles, where are you? We have to stick together. I can't see anything in here. This is a new smell. That tickles. Oh, you smell rather terrifying. Oh nice boy. Oh, there are more of you. Oh that's rather sweet. Oh there's another one! Wasn't expecting that. Did you mean to do that? What that? Careful. I don't think you understand how dangerous this is. I don't suppose you've seen a little green dinosaur have you? Whoa! Go, go, go, Speckles, go quickly, go! Boy, you can run! Not quite so surprisingly with those legs of yours. Quickly, this way, now! Go! Damn that hurts. What the, there's more up here! They've got sky crabs. Oh they're coming down as well. They can walk, they can walk. They can jump. No, no, no! No, no, no, they're surrounding us. No! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, I love it, I love it. Fantastic! What was that, what was that? Is it over? Is it over? Is it over? I told you we should have gone around. I almost died because of you. Hey, you got something to say to me? Nothing? No? How about sorry? Hello! What's up with you? Are you all right? You've been stung.

SPECKLES	It's just a scratch.

SSAI	It's poison. What are we going to do?
	
SPECKLES	I'm fine.

SSAI	No, No, No We got to act fast or the poison is going to kill you.

SPECKLES	I told you I'm fine.

SSAI	Don't be stupid. Were you this stubborn with your son? Are you sure your son was kidnapped and he didn't just run away? didn't mean that. We really have to treat that wound.

BLUE	It's food, we have to be quick!

JUNIOR	Huh?

EXTRA	Aww, Blue, hey!

BLUE	Out of my way!
	
DUSTY	My food. My food.
	
SSAI	you need rest. You can't go on like this.

SPECKLES	Leave it alone.

SSAI	It's going to be harder to save him if you're dead.

SPECKLES	you cannot possibly understand. You do not have a son. Do you?

SSAI	But, of course not. I can't even see. I'd never know where they were. Hello?

SPECKLES	Junior. Where are you? Junior.
	
SSAI	I think you're hallucinating. Junior's not here. Oh no, hey, hey, hey, are you okay? No, you can't die on me, buddy. Hello? Come back. What, what the? I'm sinking. No, no, Speckles, no! I can't go out like this! Whoa! Look out below! No, I'm okay, no I'm not! Oh my head. Sand's in my ear, get it out, get it out! Where the heck are we? Are you alive? Speckles, Speckles, wake up! You're the one that got us in this mess. You can't give up now! Hang on. What is that smell?

SPECKLES	Blue-Eyes.

SSAI	I smell something. What is it?

DUSTY	I got you this. We can share.
	
JUNIOR	I guess that means thank you.
	
BLUE	you losers. How can you eat next to a pile of poop?

JUNIOR	what about you? What are you doing here?

BLUE	me? Move over! Doesn't smell so bad.

SSAI	What, hey, no! Get away from me! Speckles, help! Thank you, Speckles. Yes, yes, yes get them, Speckles. Use the neck like she's doing. She's got the right idea! Yes, no, not like that. You've got to get underneath her with the. Do what she' doing. Oh no, no, Speckles, Speckles, ready? It's all connected so you can go for any part of her except for the neck. No, not. Good try.
	
FANG	I saved your life and you attack me?

SPECKLES	you saved me?

FANG	Yes.

SPECKLES	But How?

FANG	there were healing herbs nearby. Consider yourself lucky. You also need to eat so I was about to prepare that for you.

SSAI	That? How dare you! My name is Ssai, the one and only Ssai. Specks, are you okay? Whoa, wait a minute, you've got to be careful with that. Whoa! I'm still talking to you. Hey, watch it! Leave my friend alone!

FANG	Who is this? Your pet?

SSAI	his pet? I'm not a pet! I'm a fierce warrior in search of vengeance!

FANG	Oh that's nice. I'm a fierce warrior in search of dinner.

SSAI	I think you should save those beautiful fangs for something else. I'm not sweet, I'm sour.

FANG	How about We find Out for Sure?
	
SPECKLES	Stop it, he is not food. He is my friend.

SSAI	Yes, so there. And you are? What are you doing here?

FANG	I'm looking for my daughter. She was stolen two weeks ago. I've been tracking them since.

BLUE	watch closely this time. You whack it like this!

JUNIOR / DUSTY	Wow!

BLUE	Okay, your turn. Dusty, when you swing keep your feet on the ground like this.

DUSTY	Oh, my turn. Ow, my tail, my tail, it really hurts!

BLUE	Strike three and he's out.
	
DITTO	Come with me, kid. Hurry up, kid.
	
BLADE	Don't. It's too late. If you try they'll take you too.
	
DITTO	Move!

JUNIOR	Dusty. Papa! Save me! Save me!

DUSTY	Junior? Help me!

JUNIOR	Dusty? Huh? Huh?
	
EXTRA	There we go!
	
DSUNGA	Hey, hey, hey. Let me go, I said let me go, you pee wee!
	
DSUNGA	Okay, you win, I surrender.

JUNIOR	now talk. Tell us where you took our friend.

DSUNGA	I don't know. I swear, it's true.

JUNIOR	I don't believe a word you say. You must see a lot things up there. Let's make a deal. I will give you all of my food if you tell us everything.

DSUNGA	You'll really give it to me?

JUNIOR	Yes.

DSUNGA	Beyond the wall is a mountain. A mountain of fire. And inside it, something has been awoken. A beast like no other. Not of this world. For now it cannot leave its molten prison. But as the fire grows stronger so does the beast. And it is this that the raptors serve.

SLY	Oh wow I can't believe it. He's even bigger.

TRAPPRE	Please have mercy on us.

DITTO	Maybe just a little for me?

DSUNGA	the beast is not alone. He has three sons. Your friends are mere toys to them. And the minute they get sick of playing with them they pick them apart. So I'm afraid for Dusty it's, tsk, tsk, tsk.

JUNIOR	It's my fault. I should have stopped them. I'm a coward.

BLUE	Don't say that! There was nothing we could do.

KNIFE	She's right, you know. But don't worry, it'll be your turn soon enough.

JUNIOR	Then we've got to get out of here. We can do it if we do it together.

SLASH	What? Are you crazy? Look at them. Their claws are 10 times sharper than mine. They're stronger and faster.

JUNIOR	Yeah, Maybe, But we've got to be at least a billion times smarter than they are. Don't be silly, it should be really easy. Or are you too scared?

BLADE	You'll regret that! Stand down.
	
FANG	Water.

SSAI	what, what, really? Where, where?

SPECKLES	Oasis.
	
SSAI	Tastes so good!
	
SSAI	Oh it's so nice. Huh, what's going on? Huh? Can somebody tell me what's happening?

FANG	We have to help them—

SPECKLES	this is not our fight.

FANG	They are eggs, they're stealing them!

SPECKLES	this is none of our business.

FANG	And you're selfish. What would have happened to you if I had minded my own business?

SPECKLES	I would have been fine.

FANG	What?

SPECKLES	That's right and they will be fine as well. We don't have time.

FANG	Can't you hear those mothers crying in pain?

SPECKLES	our kids, they need us. We cannot take the risk. We must keep going.

FANG	Then go!
	
SSAI	I've been thinking, you really can be a jerk

FANG	sometimes, my friend.

SSAI	Ssai, egg! me?

FANG	Ssai, it's right in front of you!

SSAI	where is it? I felt that? Did somebody? You've got this, Specks, kick their butts! Ow, just like that. Oh, behind you! Sharp. In front of you! Nice. Guys! Fancy meeting you here. Nice day for it. Quick, guys, hurry up. Please, go away.
	
FANG	Ssai, keep it up, keep swinging.

SSAI	Okay. No one can stop me! I am the Dino King. Yes, you too! Not in my house! Come on, surely you guys can give up by now. Surely you guys give up. Hey, time out, time out. Here we go, yes! Plenty more where that came from. Yep, hit them again, oh, nope, that's no good. That's better, better, better, better. Slam it down, yes, body slam! Oh!
	
SSAI	Please spare me.

SPECKLES	Pardon?

SSAI	Please show me mercy. Haha, that's right, you better run!
	
SSAI	Oh they've got nothing on me.

FANG	you did the right thing.

SPECKLES	We should go, now.

SSAI	Quick question, what's with all the whaling? Are they in pain?

FANG	You idiot, that's how they communicate.

SSAI	Well they sound ridiculous? Can you teach me how to do it?

FANG	No, But you Can teach me your trick with that tail.

SSAI	I'm so sorry, my dear, some things cannot be taught. You either have it or you don't.

JUNIOR	see them? Up there. There's always three on guard.

SLASH	I'll show him. When he least expects it I'll definitely be there waiting in the shadows. One wrong move and he's mine.

DSUNGA	to Get to the mountain you have to first make it pass the dozen or so craters. Many with boiling lava. Then if you get past that you have to cross a deep gorge with a river way, way below.

JUNIOR	Wait, wait, so you're saying there's a stream beside the mountain?

DSUNGA	Yeah, so?

JUNIOR	My dad once told me if there's a stream it'll take us home.

BLUE	Yeah, We Can jump in and swim home.

JUNIOR	Swim?

BLUE	of course. Wait a sec, you can swim, right?

DSUNGA	the stream is the least of your worries. How will you get out of here in the first place?

JUNIOR	the raptors, they must sleep some time. Do you think we can sneak out then?

DSUNGA	It's not that easy. There's always three guards on duty. Awake at all times. They watch you like hawks.

BLADE	You'll never escape.

BLUE	How would you know?

BLADE	With a plan like that, that's crazy.

BLUE	What's your plan, bigshot? Huh? Since when do you care?

JUNIOR	Well then.

BLADE	Forget it, you wouldn't want to know.

BLUE	Very funny, Blade, just spill it.

BLADE	It's quite simple. Listen up.

DSUNGA	not bad.

BLUE	wow, that is good. I'm actually impressed.

BLADE	Yeah, I am quite amazing aren't I?

BLUE	Such an ego. Gone to his head already.

JUNIOR	Blade, who's waiting for you on the outside?

BLADE	I don't really know.
	
DSUNGA	One of the guards, he's asleep.

BLADE	Good, let's go.

DSUNGA	Oh, thank you, sir.
	
JUNIOR	Yeah!
	
BLUE	Huh?

JUNIOR	Huh? Thanks, Blade.

BLADE	It's over, come on, let's go.

DSUNGA	Phew, you're almost there. Keep going! Yeah, hurry up.

SLY	It's not nice of you to keep us waiting.

DITTO	keep us waiting.
	
SLASH	I told you I'd deliver on our deal and one of you now, right, right? I told you you'd regret it!
	
JUNIOR	Yeah!

TRAPPER	Stop right there! Get back here! It's time for dinner boys.

DITTO	Dinner boys.

TRAPPER	I hope you like barbecue.

DITTO	like barbecue, barbecue.

TRAPPER	Wait, we're missing one. Where did he go? Where's the other one hiding?

JUNIOR	No!

DITTO	where is he hiding?

TRAPPER	Spill it!

JUNIOR	I won't tell.

TRAPPER	Don't test me, boy.

DITTO	Test me, boy, Test me, boy.

JUNIOR	I'll never tell.
	
TRAPPER	We Can keep them in here until next feeding time. It will be hungry again soon.

DITTO	Hungry Again soon. I'm hungry.

TRAPPER	so am I actually.

TRAPPER / DITTO	Dinner time, dinner time, dinner time! Dinner time, Dinner time, Dinner time.
	
TRAPPER	Keep an eye on 'em.

GUARD ON DUTY	of course I will.
	
FANG	so many stars in the sky. Blue and I used to count the stars in the sky every night.

BLUE	I miss my mom. I wonder where she is now.

JUNIOR	Yeah, I miss My Dad As well.

BLUE	But when I look up I know everything will be all right.

SPECKLES	I should not have been so hard on Junior. He was healthy. That's all that really mattered.

FANG	I know what you mean, But we live in dangerous times. Our world is changing fast.

SPECKLES	that does not change the fact that his capture was all my fault. I should have protected him, but I failed him and now I may never again have the chance to tell him I love him.

BLUE	We'll never get out of here.

JUNIOR	Don't give up. We'll find a way. Be positive.

BLUE	I want to apologise. I was mean to you when we first met.

JUNIOR	I needed it. My dad was right.
JUNIOR	There are scary things in this world, but a life
JUNIOR	in the shadows is not a life worth living.

BLUE	Yeah, you're right.
	
SSAI	Oh I smell something real bad. It smells worse than Speck's backside.

SPECKLES	Hey.

SSAI	Oh, I think it's close.

FANG	what is it?

SSAI	It's raptors. They're close.
	
SLY	Scum, We spared you and you betray us? You traitor!

DSUNGA	I didn't, I'd never do that.

TRAPPER	Liar, let's cut off his wings.

DITTO	Let's cut off his wings.

TRAPPER / DITTO	Which one should we cut off first?

DSUNGA	Please, don't—

SSAI	Hey you! Yes, you half-tail and the size.

SLY	is he talking to me?

SSAI	you, half-tail, the dummy, and the idiot.

DITTO	half-tail, dummy, and the idiot.

TRAPPER	I'm out!
	
SLY	Stop copying. Let's get him!

SSAI	Oh Oh Okay, here We go, ready for this. Here we go.
	
DITTO	You're never going to catch me. It's behind you. Ow my tail.
	
SPECKLES	We meet at last.

SSAI	The compound.

SPECKLES	Compound? Where is that?

DITTO	if you follow the stream you Can find the compound.

SPECKLES	are you Sure?

DITTO	Yeah, yeah. Please don't cut off my tail.

SPECKLES	It's not up to me. It's up to Ssai, the warrior.

DITTO	may have a different opinion.

SSAI	You killed my Daisy and now it's time you meet the claw of justice! Vengeance was mine. Yes indeed, vengeance was—

SPECKLES	Let's go.
