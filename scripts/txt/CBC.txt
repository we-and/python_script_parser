BECKY	Haven’t you read that book like a hundred times already?

CHANCE	It’s a classic.

BECKY	Just because something's old doesn’t make it a classic.

CHANCE	Because it’s a classic, it never gets old. 

BECKY	Hm.

CHANCE	Haven’t you ever read it?

BECKY	Of course, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times”...

CHANCE	Hm. That is a “Tale of Two Cities”.

BECKY	Are you sure?

CHANCE	(chuckles) What’s that?

BECKY	An early Christmas present to cheer you up. And coffee...

CHANCE	Thank you! What’s this? I already have business cards. Plus, haven’t you read the big sign at the front?	

BECKY	Yes, and Yes. But...

CHANCE	But what?

BECKY	Your business cards are so old they have a handwritten email address on them and no social media accounts. I think these might predate the internet.

CHANCE	(chuckles) Okay. But still: the sign.

BECKY	I’ve decided I’m not letting you go out of business!

CHANCE	Becky, you know I love this place more than anything in the world. But you’ve seen the numbers. We just can't compete in this new digital shopping world. People don’t want to leave their homes to come find treasures anymore. They can have it all at the tips of their fingers.

BECKY	Chance, we can do this, okay? We just need to create some buzz! A a new website, social media accounts, a blog. You’ll notice all your new accounts are on the card.

CHANCE	I don’t know what half of these are!

BECKY	You will learn. Plus, I already pre-programmed them to set up daily posts.

CHANCE	What does that even mean?

BECKY	Just give me until the end of the holidays, okay? If this doesn’t help to turn things around, I will finally learn the difference between a half-caff non-fat soy macchiato and a non-fat misto tea latte.

CHANCE	Becky...

BECKY	Come on! What do you have to lose?

CHANCE	Definitely not a barista.

BECKY	See? I’m doomed without this job.

CHANCE	Okay. But it's gonna take a Christmas Miracle.

RYAN	Oh! Ah! Ah! So late! Of course, this happens when I'm late! And he knows I'm late! And the more I talk, the more I'm late. 

WILL	You’re late.

RYAN	I’m so sorry. I picked up the research file for your new men’s line: stripes are in; plaid is out. I mailed out the promo packages for your new fragrance Eau de Adventureand I emailed your sister to confirm that you and Ms. Brooks will be attending her Christmas dinner.

WILL	Wonderful. Did you book the Astro Lounge for the New Year’s event? I want that presentation to be revolutionary.

RYAN	Yes sir.

WILL	Great. Oh! And, uh, let’s make sure the usual social media savvy crowd are there ready to live-stream. I want everything to scream young, ambitious, adventurous executives. Everybody should leave that event wanting to wear our clothing, fragrance and accessories.

RYAN	Absolutely.

WILL	Okay. Did you specify dress code?

RYAN	Uh, of course. Oh! And I picked up your Santa hat.

WILL	Santa hat?

RYAN	The magazine wanted the cover to have you in a Santa hat. Research shows it makes you appear more “festive and approachable”. It was part of the terms you agreed to. Now, remember, sir it’s all about the image. Your words.

WILL	(sighs) I look ridiculous.

RYAN	Well, look at it this way, sir: this'll be the last year you’ll be voted Most Eligible Bachelor. After Christmas Eve, you’ll be off the market for good.

WILL	Yeah, that's true. Speaking of which: did you pick up my mother’s ring from the safety deposit box?

RYAN	Ah, yeah. It's in my pocket.

WILL	Great. Guard it with your life.

RYAN	I would die for it, sir. Now, we need to wrap up this photo session. You have a press conference in five minutes and a board meeting at ten am.

WILL	(sighs) I am very approachable and festive... when it’s required.

BECKY	(clears throat) Maybe both on the hips?

CHANCE	Hip.

BECKY	Maybe?

BECKY	Umm... maybe try a different side?

CHANCE	What do you mean a different side? I’m looking at the camera!

BECKY	I mean try favoring your left side. Everyone has a good side.

CHANCE	A good side? Don’t they look the same?

BECKY	No. They look completely different. 

CHANCE	Huh.

BECKY	I think we need a Santa hat!

CHANCE	This is ridiculous! Why does anyone want to see pictures of me for the blog? Why aren’t we taking pictures of the treasures in this store?

BECKY	Because customers want to buy things from people they know and trust, okay? Our best chance to increase sales is by getting customers to know and love you!

CHANCE	Ugh!

BECKY	Besides, the first post is all about you and how you started this place.

CHANCE	Really? You wrote an entire post about that?

BECKY	I may not be good at ordering lattes, but I do have an English degree and a soft spot for sappy stories.

CHANCE	An English degree? Aren’t you being a little generous?

BECKY	‘Tis the season.

CHANCE	So, ah... what did you write?

BECKY	The truth. That your father was a collector of art and books and vintage furniture and that when he passed away, you spent your college tuition money to open up this store in his memory, so that he’d always be with you.

CHANCE	That was such a long time ago. I was so naive to think I could make this work long term.

BECKY	You don't regret opening the store, do you?

CHANCE	Not a moment.

BECKY	(sighs)

CHANCE	What am I going to do if this doesn’t work out?

BECKY	I don’t know. But if we have a chance of making this work, we have got to find your good side, okay? Come on! Break’s over. Let's go! Let's see that turn.

CHANCE	(clears throat) The turn.

BECKY	The turn.

CHANCE	Ha!

BECKY	(chuckles)

CHANCE	It's better when I make noises.

RYAN	Here are your talking points regarding the sale of Rutherford and Sons and these are for the acquisition of Mason-White.

WILL	Perfect. May I see the ring, please?

RYAN	Yeah.

WILL	Has it been sized yet?

RYAN	Ah, it will be! As soon as you find out Ms. Brooks ring size... discretely.

WILL	Right. Haven’t done that yet. How does one discretely find out the size of a woman’s ring finger?	

RYAN	I wouldn’t know sir. I work too much to have a girlfriend. But I'll put that on my list of things to figure out and I'll get back to you, Mr. Richards. Okay? Doh! Testing, testing, testing, testing. Okay. No, let's go.

WILL	Merry Christmas, everyone. Thank you for coming. I have a few moments to answer some questions.

REPORTER #1	Mr. Richards, with the recent acquisition of Mason-White, we're wondering what are your plans for the corporation’s new direction? Will you keep their current fashion lines?

WILL	Well, I would like to increase the annual growth by at least twenty percent next year by introducing a new men’s line led by fashion icon Jacob Chi.

REPORTER #2	Ah, Mr. Richards, was the sale of Rutherford and Sons the result of the CEO’s potential involvement in the latest political scandal?

WILL	Rutherford and Sons was a business strategy that was put into motion six months ago and wasn't influenced in any way by exterior rumors.

REPORTER #3	Mr. Richards, keeping with rumors, would you care to comment on the social media chatter bout you and Ms. Leyla Brooks potentially getting engaged in the near future? Is there any truth that our most eligible bachelor may soon find himself #TyingTheKnot?

WILL	I have no comment. My relationship with Miss Brooks is personal. Next question.

SEVERAL REPORTERS	Mr. Richards! Mr. Richards!

CHANCE	This is really good! Sappy, but good.

BECKY	Thanks! We just need to add this photo here and... post!

CHANCE	Do you really think this could help save the store?

BECKY	Yes, I do. If you take it seriously and try.

CHANCE	It’s just so hard for me to put myself out there for the whole world to see. This stuff is so... personal. And I don’t know anything about this new social-media-savvy world.

BECKY	That’s why you have me!

CHANCE	Thank you.

BECKY	And, look: we finally found your good side!

CHANCE	Did you flip the image?

BECKY	Mm. 

CHANCE/BECKY	(chuckle)

BECKY	And, hey! You know, at the very least, maybe this whole thing will put you out there a little ore. You can finally find a nice guy to share a meal with.

CHANCE	You know, me and Captain Bubbles are just fine on our own.

BECKY	You can’t cuddle with a fish!

CHANCE	No. But he is a better listener than my last boyfriend and he doesn’t complain when I watch reality shows, so... I take that as a win.

BECKY	Fair enough. What do you want for lunch?

CHANCE	Sushi?

RYAN	Presentation for the meeting.

WILL	Perfect. Have you found a first copy of A Christmas Carol for Leyla yet?

RYAN	Ah, still working on that, Mr. Richards. You know, are you sure she’s going to like it? She doesn’t strike me as the reading type.

WILL	(chuckles) It’s a classic. I’m sure she’ll love it as much as I do. It was a tradition in my family to read it every single Christmas and that's a tradition I’d like to continue when Leyla and I get married.

RYAN	Yes Sir.

WILL	Uh... and I’d like you to walk me through the rest of the plans for my big proposal. I want this week to be perfect.

RYAN	About that, Sir.

WILL	What about that, Ryan?

RYAN	I’ve been thinking, you know, I’m great at keeping your life on track...

WILL	Yeah. That’s why I keep you around.

RYAN	But perhaps you need someone a little more...

WILL	More what?

RYAN	Qualified to plan and organize your big romantic proposal sir.

WILL	Ryan, you're the only one I trust.

RYAN	Okay, full disclosure. I haven’t had a girlfriend in two years and my best date ever was taking a girl to a comic book convention dressed in a cape and purple tights.

WILL	Sounds like fun to me.

WILL	The most romantic thing I’ve been able to come up with involves laser tag and tickets to an Escape room. Okay, my anxiety levels have been steadily climbing ever since you asked me to put this together and I’m afraid I’m just not cut out for romance, sir!

WILL	Shh! I'm proposing in just over a week! Where do you want me to find help in such short notice?

RYAN	The internet? 

WILL	(scoffs)

RYAN	Perhaps you could plan it yourself, you know? Yeah. Keep it simple; from the heart.

WILL	Plan it myself? Keep it simple? Wouldn't happen to know any romance experts by any chance, would you?

RYAN	No, I don’t. 

RYAN	But I do know where you might be able to find that first edition for Leyla. Now get in there, sir. They’re waiting for you and you have a lunch meeting with Mrs. Jensen.

WILL	Right. "By Chance Gifts". (sighs) Morning, everyone!

CHANCE	Sorry, we’re closed.

WILL	Uh, yeah, I can see that, but if I could just have a moment? It’s really important.

CHANCE	Sure. How can I help?

WILL	I’m, uh, I'm looking for a first edition copy of A Christmas Carol. I have your card here; thought you might have it.

CHANCE	I haven’t handed those out yet. How did you get that?

WILL	By chance I suppose.

CHANCE	Ha. That’s funny. “By Chance”... because my name...

CHANCE	Anyway, you’re looking for A Christmas Carol? It's one of my favourite books.

WILL	So, you have it, then?

CHANCE	I do. But it’s my personal copy and, unfortunately, it’s not for sale. I’m sorry, I can’t help you.	

WILL	Come on. You gotta have a price. Everyone's got a price, right?

CHANCE	I’m sorry. It was a gift from my father. But I do have a first edition copy of Jane Eyre, if you’re interested.

WILL	No. It's it's gotta be that book. See, I'm giving it to my girlfriend, who I’m proposing to; trying to be romantic.

CHANCE	Aw! A romantic. Don’t see those too often these days.

WILL	Well, like I said, I’m trying to be, but it turns out I’m not very good at it.

CHANCE	Seems like you’re off to a great start!

WILL	Not unless you sell me that book.

CHANCE	(chuckles) Listen, I can’t sell you my book. But I am a hopeless romantic so I can do my best to track down another copy for you. When do you need it by?

WILL	Christmas Eve.

CHANCE	I’ll see what I can do.

WILL	Thanks!

CHANCE	Sure, no problem. You know how to contact me there’s like a million ways to reach me on that card.

WILL	I’ll be in touch.

CHANCE	Great!

WILL	Great. When you said you were a hopeless romantic, does that mean you’re good at it?

BECKY	You agreed to do what?

CHANCE	I know. It’s crazy.

BECKY	Okay, so let me get this straight: William Richards, the "most eligible bachelor” three years running, walks into your store and offers you... how much to plan a romantic proposal for his super model girlfriend?

CHANCE	First of all, I had no idea who he was until I did some research on him last night. 

BECKY	Uh! Ah.

CHANCE	Secondly, I couldn’t say no. He offered me enough to keep this place open for another month while we figure things out.

BECKY	It’s a Christmas Miracle!

CHANCE	(laughs) Not so fast!

BECKY	(exclaims)

CHANCE	I still need to come up with an incredible week of romance leading up to an epic proposal and sweep this girl off her feet!

BECKY	Oh, please! You are the queen of romance. You’ve watched every Meg Ryan movie; you basically have the Titanic soundtrack on repeat.

CHANCE	It's true.

BECKY	So, what’s step one?

CHANCE	Well, I wanted to really get to know this girl before I plan her dream engagement, so...

BECKY	So, you went undercover and tracked her around town last night? (gasps)

CHANCE	No. Of course not.

BECKY	Oh.

CHANCE	I took your lead and looked up all her social media accounts. What better way to get to know who someone truly is?

BECKY	Um....

CHANCE	I checked out all of her profiles. This girl seems amazing: dog lover; philanthropist; loves kids; loves theatre; fitness enthusiast. I mean, she even has a beauty blog. Did you notice my new lip colour? It's Christmas Nude.

BECKY	Very nice.

CHANCE	I can see why Will wants to marry this girl. She’s basically perfect!

BECKY	So, you based all your research on her social media accounts?

CHANCE	Of course.

BECKY	Okay. And based on that... "research," um... what exactly did you do for this first grand romantic gestures?

CHANCE	She kept posting these really sweet photos of shelter dogs who needed loving homes, so...

BECKY	So?

CHANCE	I got a shelter dog delivered to her office this morning from Will!

BECKY	Oh, no.

CHANCE	What?

WILL	Leyla!

LEYLA	What is this?

WILL	Hey, hey, hey! It's a puppy!

LEYLA	No, Will. It’s a dog. A fully grown, shedding, smelly dog.

WILL	You want a belly rub?

LEYLA	(clears throat)

WILL	Ah, right. Ah, dog.

LEYLA	From you.

WILL	From me? Yes! Uh uh from me. Do you like it?

LEYLA	I do.

WILL	Oh good!

LEYLA	From afar.

WILL	What? But I thought you loved dogs.

LEYLA	Yes, Will. In pictures and in parks and on other people’s leashes.

WILL	But you're always posting about shelter dogs and about how adopting pets in need is so important.

LEYLA	My agent said it would look good for my image. Look, Will, I I hope they find good homes. I I really do. I just don’t want them to find my home.

WILL	Yeah, but don’t you think a furry little friend'd be a great addition to our lives?

LEYLA	A tennis bracelet would be a good addition to my life. A dog is a complete overhaul.

WILL	Uh, I just thought...

LEYLA	Will, we are both so busy; career-oriented; and well-dressed. A dog sheds and requires time and attention that we both just don’t have right now.

WILL	Yeah, but don’t you want to change that a little? Make a little more time for us? A dog would mean more walks together and quiet evenings at home.

LEYLA	Oh, I love you. But we have our careers to focus on. We can’t be tied down like that.

WILL	Ha. Okay. I'll I'll take him back.

LEYLA	Thank you. And don’t forget we’re hosting my Annual Christmas game night tonight: your place, 8 PM sharp, dress code in full effect and I hired Pierre for his famous gluten-free vegan chocolate truffles. 

WILL	Ooh.

LEYLA	Do not be late.

RYAN	Oh, hey, Miss Brooks!

LEYLA	Ryan.

RYAN	Oh! A puppy? Can we keep him?

WILL	Can you get, uh, Chance on the phone? Tell her we need to meet?

RYAN	Uh, yeah. Sure.

WILL	Well, guess you're with me for the day. Come on. (clicks tongue)

WILL	Hey. 

CHANCE	Hi little guy! (chuckles)

WILL	So, I, uh... thought you said you were good at this?

CHANCE	I am. I just... I didn’t factor in the whole social media curve.

WILL	What do you mean?

CHANCE	I mean, when I researched Leyla’s profiles, I didn’t realize that people weren’t always 100% truthful on those sites. By her posts, it looked like a dog would have been the perfect romantic gift to kick off your proposal week.

WILL	(sighs) Well, it wasn’t.

CHANCE	(sighs) How did that not work? Look at this face!

WILL	(chuckles) Well, he is pretty adorable. And I’m sure Leyla will warm up to him eventually. But, I mean, Chance, you can’t truly get to know somebody just by looking at their profile.

CHANCE	Actually, I think that’s the exact purpose of those sites: to share with others who you really are.

WILL	So so you mean to tell me that everything you post on there about yourself is true?

CHANCE	I think so. I mean, I’ve only had a few posts but, yeah, of course it's true. Why would I lie about myself?

WILL	No, not lie. Uh, just create an image. You know, show the world who you want to be not who you really are.

CHANCE	But I am who I want to be. Aren’t you?

WILL	Uh... (chuckles). Yeah. Uh... 

CHANCE	I'll take him. Come here, little guy. You're coming with me. Am I fired?

WILL	(chuckles) No. 

CHANCE	Okay.

WILL	But you will have to look after this guy for the next few weeks until Leyla warms up to him. And I think you should get to know the real Leyla before you plan our next move.

CHANCE	Okay. What do we do?

WILL	We go undercover! (laughs) I'll explain.

CHANCE	Oh, boy! Okay. (giggles) Wait up!

BECKY	So, you're William's personal assistant?

RYAN	Uh, more like an executive assistant.

BECKY	Oh!

RYAN	Yeah.

BECKY	Right.

RYAN	It's okay.

CHANCE	So?

BECKY	I don't think I've ever seen you in a dress before.

CHANCE	Thanks?

RYAN	And the finishing touch.

BECKY	Oh!

CHANCE	Do I have to wear those?

RYAN	Oh, well, it came with the dress and with Mr. Richards’ instructions.

BECKY	I’ll wear them!

CHANCE	Good idea. You go undercover.

BECKY	I wish. But I have a feeling no one is going to believe I’m Will’s father’s best friend’s daughter from England. I’m tone deaf, so my English accent sounds like a mix of French and cyborg.

RYAN	You speak cyborg?

BECKY	A few dialects.

RYAN	Nice.

CHANCE	Guys! Okay! I’ll wear the shoes.

CHANCE	Almost... got it! (giggles) How do I look?

BECKY / RYAN	Tall!

CHANCE	And who am I again?

BECKY / RYAN	Will’s father’s best friend’s daughter from England!

CHANCE	And what’s his name?

BECKY	Who?

CHANCE	Will’s father’s best friend my dad.

BECKY	Oh, this is really getting complicated. Uh...

RYAN	Okay, well, uh... don’t get bogged down in the details. Just stay focused on the broad strokes.

BECKY	Right.

CHANCE	Okay. And remind me: why am I doing this again?

BECKY	To get to know Leyla so you can craft the perfect proposal, which will, in turn, save the store that you love so much. Plus, it’ll be fun! Just imagine you’re in an old detective novel.

RYAN	(gasps) Oooh.

CHANCE	Right. I can do this. Are you good to watch him for the night?

BECKY	You know we need to name him, right?

CHANCE	We can’t name him because we’re not keeping him. We’re just pet sitting until Leyla warms up to the idea.

RYAN	You might want to name him.

BECKY	(gasps)

CHANCE	What? No! No one is naming this adorable, little fluff ball. Because if we name him, he’ll feel like he’s ours and then we’ll want to keep him. That’s how it works.

BECKY	Right. You're right. Yes. No name.

BECKY	No name.

RYAN	Your chariot awaits.

BECKY	Oh! Just try to have some fun tonight, okay?

CHANCE	I thought I was going to a game night. Who can play charades in this outfit?

RYAN	Leyla’s crowd is big on dress codes.

CHANCE	Okay. (breathes deeply) I'm thinking of two words! I got this.

RYAN	That's three words.

CHANCE	I'm thinking of three words! (giggles)

RYAN	You got this.

BECKY	You got this.

RYAN	Yeah.

CHANCE	I got it. I got it.

RYAN	Yeah.

CHANCE	I thought that was implied.

BECKY	You got it!

RYAN	No. Right. Just want to make sure.

BECKY	You got it!

CHANCE	Okay. Great.

LEYLA	... you know that I like matches my blanket.

WOMAN	I did not know that.

WILL	That was my fault. Sorry for...

LEYLA	(laughs)

CHANCE	(laughs)

WILL	Chance.

CHANCE	Hi!

WILL	Wow. You look…

CHANCE	Tall?

WILL	I was going to say beautiful.

CHANCE	Oh. Thank you. I mean: Thank you.

WILL	What’s that?

CHANCE	My English accent.

WILL	Oh! Oh, yeah. It’s it's really good. So, you're ready?

CHANCE	Yes. This is going to be fun! Like an old detective novel.

WILL	Yes. Exactly. Tonight's all about recon. And I rigged the teams so that you and Leyla are together. She loves England. You'll have tons to talk about.

CHANCE	Will, I’m not actually from England.

WILL	Right. But you’ve seen the Royal wedding?

CHANCE	Yes. Of course.

WILL	Ah. You’ll be fine.

CHANCE	Okay. But what if I get into trouble and she starts to suspect that something's up?

WILL	Just give me some sort of a sign. I’ll come to the rescue.

CHANCE	What kind of sign?

WILL	Touch your left ear.

CHANCE	Left ear. Got it.

LEYLA	You must be Olivia.

CHANCE	Actually, I’m...

WILL	Yes, yes. This is my father’s best friend’s daughter, Olivia. Olivia, this is my girlfriend Leyla.

CHANCE	It's a pleasure to meet you, Leyla. I’ve heard so much about you.

LEYLA	You have? I didn’t realize you two were so close. Will, why haven’t you mentioned Olivia before today?

CHANCE	Oh! We’re not close. I meant my father talks about you and he hears that from Will, of course, because they are close. We are not close. I don’t even really like William. But I don’t not like him. We just don’t really know each other that well...

LEYLA	What did you say your father’s name was again?

CHANCE	John.

WILL	Paul.

LEYLA	(chuckles) Like the Pope? 

WILL	Yes! Exactly like the pope. Why don't we, uh, join the rest of the party?

LEYLA	Sure.

WILL	You talk a lot when you’re nervous, huh?

CHANCE	Maybe a little.

WILL	Breathe. This'll be fun. (chuckles)

LEYLA	You’re just on time. Everyone, this is Olivia, William’s family friend.

CHANCE	Hello.

JOLENE	Hello! Love your shoes! Where did you get those?

CHANCE	Oh! They were a gift... from the Queen.

JOLENE	Wow. You know the Queen! 

CHANCE	Mm-hm.

JOLENE	Were you at the wedding? What did you wear?

WILL	Okay! Who wants to choose teams?

LEYLA	Actually, we chose the teams while you were answering the door. Looks like you two are together.

WILL	Oh. Great! Oh. Sorry, it’s work. I gotta take this. James? Not a problem. Feliz Navidad.

CHANCE	So, Leyla: what’s your favorite color?

LEYLA	Pink.

CHANCE	Pink. Really? I would have taken you for a red girl, or crimson, maybe, but pink? I love pink! Favourite food?

LEYLA	Vegan Charcuterie.

CHANCE	Okay. Haven’t heard of that one before... don’t even know what that is. But it sounds good. I’ll have to try it some time. Favourite sport?

LEYLA	Oh! (laughs) I’m not really a sports kind of gal.

JOLENE	You did do figure skating as a kid, though.

LEYLA	I did like wearing the cute outfits.

CHANCE	Interesting. Skating is so romantic. Couples skating is just my favourite Olympic sport. Don’t you love it? Anyway, moving on: um, favourite piece of jewelry?

LEYLA	Uh, I actually always wanted a tennis bracelet. Are we playing 20 questions or charades?

CHANCE	Oh! I’m sorry. I talk a lot when I get nervous.

LEYLA	Apparently.

JOLENE	Enough about Leyla. Tell us all about the Royal wedding.

CHANCE	Um...

WILL	Okay! Who wants to play charades?

CHANCE	I would! Very much.

JOLENE	Snow man! Uh... Christmas tree! Reindeer!

LEYLA	Reindeer? Egg nog!

JOLENE	Oh.

WILL	Your turn.

CHANCE	Thank you.

LEYLA	Hey.

JOLENE	Sorry.

LEYLA	Kidding me?

MALE GUEST	I got it. Yeah.

WILL	Two words. First word. Cold. Snow. Second word.

WILL	Ring. Halo. Angel. Snow angel!

CHANCE	(laughs)

WILL	(laughs) Ye-eh-es. Alright!

JOLENE	That was five wins in a row. You guys are unstoppable!

LEYLA	Wow, Will. I didn’t realize your friend was a professional mime!

CHANCE	That was fun!

WILL	(chuckles) Yeah, it really was.

LEYLA	Was it? Because I just lost five games in a row and I think it’s time for Pictionary. Are you a professional artist, too?
CHANCE	Ah, I think it’s time I call it a night.

JOLENE	No! Um... (clears throat). Don’t go. I would really love to hear more about the royal wedding. 	

LEYLA	Mm. (clears throat)

JOLENE	And, um... I'm so impressed that you were actually there.

CHANCE	Well, I was there. 

JOLENE	Uh huh.

CHANCE	In England. 

JOLENE	Wow.

CHANCE	While it was happening.

JOLENE	Oh my gosh.

CHANCE	So, I was there, and it is definitely time for me to go. 

JOLENE	Oh.

CHANCE	It was really lovely to meet you all. Leyla, thank you for having me.

LEYLA	Pleasure.

WILL	I’ll walk you out.

WILL	Did you get everything you needed?

CHANCE	Yes. I'm going to make this week leading up to your big engagement the most romantic week ever! Make sure Leyla’s available tomorrow night. I’ll send you details in the morning.

WILL	Great. And Chance? 

CHANCE	Yes, William?

WILL	Thank you.

CHANCE	Of course. 

WILL	(chuckles)

CHANCE	No problem.

BECKY	And make sure you check us out on social media. Okay. Bye!

CHANCE	I knew dating a hockey coach would come in handy one day!

BECKY	Found it. Okay. How many lights do you want?

CHANCE	All of them. And let's get a big Christmas tree for the centre of the rink.

BECKY	That’s good.

CHANCE	And what’s that song that kids play at prom?

BECKY	Uh... Boom, boom, let’s go back to my room.

CHANCE	No! No, no, no, no! The other one the sappy one.

BECKY	Oh! Forever love.

CHANCE	Yes! Can you add that to my playlist, please?

BECKY	Oh! Classic.

CHANCE	This is going to be perfect. What could possibly be more romantic than a midnight skate date?	

BECKY	Okay. Well, other than finding out that Ms. Leyla Brooks was once a figure skating princess, what else happened last night?

CHANCE	It was fun.

BECKY	Fun? You were in the home of William Richards. His home was featured in Million Dollar Mansions. Spill it. How does the other half live? What’s Leyla like? Is No-Name going to be happy there? 

CHANCE	Did you just call our dog No-Name?

BECKY	Did you just call No-Name our dog?

CHANCE	He's gonna love it there! It’s beautiful. Plus, Will is actually really nice. And fun.

BECKY	And Leyla?

CHANCE	She’s... pretty.

BECKY	And nice?

CHANCE	Uh huh. And clean!

BECKY	That’s good. Oh, she is not going to warm up to the idea of having a dog, is she?

CHANCE	Not with that furniture!

CHANCE	Hi partner!

WILL	Hey! How’s it looking?

CHANCE	Amazing.

WILL	Oh. Fantastic! Leyla'll love it.

CHANCE 	I picked up the skates, got them sharpened, cute outfit waiting for her in the dressing room and, to set the perfect mood, a mix between Christmas music and classic rock love ballads!

WILL	Fantastic! I got one last meeting and then I’m going to head right over. If you could please have Ryan send a car for Leyla in half an hour, that'd be great?

CHANCE	Will do.

WILL	Great. I'll see you then.

CHANCE	I’ll be here, hiding in the DJ booth 'cause this epic mix won’t mix itself.

CHANCE	Okay, Becky - hit it!

BECKY	Wow.

CHANCE	It's perfect.

RYAN	I wonder if this is what it feels like to be in the ice capades? Careful!

BECKY	I think this tree just needs one last finishing touch.

CHANCE	Ryan, you know Leyla pretty well, right?

RYAN	I do?

CHANCE	I mean, you see her every day, right?

RYAN	I do.

CHANCE	So, what do you think? Is she going to love it?

RYAN	Well, if I knew what made Ms. Brooks happy, then you’d be out of a job and I'd still be in charge of this overwhelming task.

CHANCE	It’s not that hard to be romantic.

RYAN	No. I suppose not. But, generally speaking, it is with women like Ms. Brooks, however.

CHANCE	Why? She seems... nice.

RYAN	Yeah! She is nice. And smart and very driven. It's just... I don’t think she's ready to give up her part-time life in Paris and weekends in New York to settle down with anyone just yet.

CHANCE	You don’t think she’ll say yes?

RYAN	No, no. No. I I I didn’t say that!

CHANCE	But you implied it.

RYAN	What? No! Hey, I I think you’re reading too deep into it.

CHANCE	Is that why you walked away from this responsibility?

RYAN	No! I love my job. I love working for Mr. Richards. It's just... I don’t want to be the one to blame if this whole thing alls apart.

CHANCE	And that’s where I come in? To pick up the pieces?

RYAN	Or sweep them under the rug.

CHANCE	Will is... handsome and fun and nice. Of course, she’ll say yes.

RYAN	I hope you’re right. 

BECKY	Okay, everyone: selfie for the blog! I think we can officially add special event planning to our list of services.

CHANCE	Really?

BECKY	Uh huh. Come on! 

BECKY	Say freeze!

CHANCE/RYAN	Freeze!

BECKY	Perfect!

CHANCE	Yeah!

CHANCE	Becky. Do you read me? Any sign of Ryan and Leyla yet? What’s their ETA?

BECKY	Nothing yet. Let me text Ryan again.

CHANCE	Will's going to be here any minute. Where are they?

BECKY	Oh no.

CHANCE	Oh no what?

BECKY	Um...

CHANCE	Becky, I know that tone.

BECKY	Leyla’s not coming.

CHANCE	What?

BECKY	She has an early morning photo shoot and needs her “beauty sleep”. 

CHANCE	She did not say that. Okay, go tell Ryan to knock on that door and find a way to get Leyla here.

BECKY	Yep, yep. Okay, I’m on it. Oh no!

CHANCE	What now?

BECKY	Will is here. Chance, you need to stall him.

CHANCE	How?

BECKY	Be creative. Look, you stall Will and I’ll keep working on Ryan, working on Leyla.

CHANCE	Deal! But work fast. This night has taken a lot of impeccable planning and it really needs to go well. And these trees were really heavy to bring inside. And do you know how many favors I had to pull to get this rink? 

BECKY	Chance, you need to stop stalling here and start stalling him! Now!

CHANCE	Right!

CHANCE	Hey!

WILL	Hi.

CHANCE	What do you think?

WILL	It’s beautiful.

CHANCE	I’m really glad you like it.

WILL	Yeah, I do. Very much.

CHANCE	Um, so Ryan and Leyla are on the way. They're just running a bit behind

BECKY	Ryan can’t get Leyla out of the house! This is a disaster!! I don’t know what else to do.

CHANCE	That was a wrong number.

BECKY	Chance? Hello, Chance! Do you read, Chance? 

WILL	It’s a walkie-talkie.

BECKY	The Eagle has landed.

CHANCE	It sure is.

WILL	Uh, it's okay. I already know.

CHANCE	You do?

WILL	Yeah. She’s busy. Big photo shoot in the morning. Priorities.

CHANCE	Yeah! Totally. She needs her beauty sleep! Who doesn’t? Am I right?

WILL	(chuckles) I’m just sorry that you had to go through all this trouble.

CHANCE	Oh, not at all. I really thought this was going to be an incredible night grand gesture and all.	

WILL	Well, we still have a few more days before the big proposal, so any other tricks up your sleeve?	

CHANCE	A few.

WILL	Great.

CHANCE	It’s beautiful. A single white rose signifies spiritual love.

WILL	Soul mates. True love.

CHANCE	A man who knows his symbolism. You are a romantic.

WILL	(chuckles) With terrible luck. Told you I was bad at romance.

CHANCE	The best moments in life happen... “By Chance”

WILL	Ha. Ha.

CHANCE	I I better start taking this stuff down.

WILL	And, uh, ruin a perfectly good mix of Christmas music and classic rock ballads?

CHANCE	You got a better idea?

WILL	Well, I did buy you a pretty killer pair of heels the other day, so I happen to know you that you have the exact same shoe size as Leyla.

CHANCE	I do.

WILL	Why not put brand new skates to use? What do you say?

CHANCE	(groans) I’m really out of practice.

WILL	C’mon.

CHANCE	You know, I did put a lot of effort into those songs. Why not?

WILL	Who knew that vegan, gluten-free Christmas cookies could taste so good?

CHANCE	Right? I’ve learned a lot these past few days.

WILL	Yeah? Like what?

CHANCE	Like people can survive without gluten. And that I can balance on both heels and skates with only minimal damage.

WILL	You don’t get out much, do you?

CHANCE	I’m a creature of habit. I surround myself with old things. I’m always at my store where everything is safe and familiar.

WILL	Not much of a risk taker?

CHANCE	Calculated risks.

WILL	Don’t you don't you wanna explore new things?

CHANCE	Hey, I’m exploring new things! Gluten-free snacks, figure skating. Oh, and I think I may have just adopted a dog.

WILL	(laughs) Touché.

CHANCE	I don’t know. I guess I've always felt like I didn’t really fit in in this time period. Everyone wants shiny new things new experiences, new artists, new fashions. I just think there’s something so magical about the classics. The past holds so many memories; moments locked in time.

WILL	Is that why you opened the store?

CHANCE	I opened the store because my father was a collector of vintage furniture and art and books. And when he passed away, those things were all that was left of him.

WILL	I’m sorry.

CHANCE	I was so young and I still needed my dad, so I surrounded myself with memories of him and I guess I just became a part of them. But what about you? What’s your story Mr. Most Eligible Bachelor of the Year three times in a row!

WILL	I hate that title.

CHANCE	Really? 

WILL	Yeah.

CHANCE	'Cause I think most men would love that.

WILL	No, it’s just it's not who I am at all. I have this image to uphold, so everything that I do is to either build my company, or my brand.

CHANCE	Why do you feel like you need to be something other than who you are to build a brand? Don’t you think people like the real you?

WILL	(sighs) I don’t know. I... guess I’m not willing to risk finding out. Hm.

CHANCE	I bet you'd be pleasantly surprised. Under all the bells and whistles who is William Richards?	

WILL	No one's ever asked me that before. 

CHANCE 	Hm.

WILL	You, the truth is I ... don't really know who I am beyond my brand.

CHANCE	Of course, you do. What part about your image is real?

WILL	Well, the part that I I love my job. I love to travel. Care about my company, my employees.

CHANCE	Okay. And what part about your image is false?

WILL	Well, I’m definitely not an eligible bachelor. And I do want to settle down, have a family. A dog. (laughs) And just spend less time at the office and more time enjoying life.

CHANCE	And why would that be so bad to admit?

WILL	Guess those aspects just aren’t in line with my brand. See, when people follow me, or buy one of our products, you know, they're buying an idea a belief that if they buy these products, or these things, they're somehow buying into the lifestyle that I represent.

CHANCE	Does Leyla know the real you or just your brand? 

WILL	Um... she she knows what I want.

CHANCE	Yeah. Of course. Sorry! That's none of my business. I didn’t mean to pry. 

WILL	It's okay.

CHANCE	We should probably pack up and get going.

WILL	That thing is going to take us a really long time.

CHANCE	Good thing we're hopped up on sugar! Bring the cookies!

CHANCE	Don’t look at me like that. I know. I blew it! I totally pried and asked too many questions and I don’t know how many more chances I’m going to get. I know! You and I are both in trouble if I don’t get this right.

MR. DAVIS	Morning young lady!

CHANCE	Hi Mr. D!

MR. DAVIS	Oh! Cute Dog. What’s his name?

CHANCE	Oh, we’re calling him No-Name.

MR. DAVIS	Okay. Original. I like it.

CHANCE	(laughs) There you go. Thanks so much for this. Yes! The kids are going to love these stories!

MR. DAVIS	You know, I’m bringing my granddaughter to your Operation Christmas charity toy drive again this year.

CHANCE	Ah! That’s great! I look forward to seeing her.

MR. DAVIS	Well, she just loves that your Santa reads them a story. I think it’s wonderful what your teaching our kids. I mean, encouraging children to donate some of their toys to other kids in need? Teaches them important values.

CHANCE	Thank you, Mr. Davis.

MR. DAVIS	Oh! Who's going to be your Santa this year?

CHANCE	Mr. Hughes, of course! Best Santa in town.

MR. DAVIS	You mean the Best Santa “out of town”.

CHANCE	What?

MR. DAVIS	Didn’t he tell you? Mr. Hughes is spending the Holidays with Mrs. Hughes in Florida this year. They left last week.

CHANCE	Oh no! I totally forgot he was leaving.

MR. DAVIS	Sorry, kid. Ah, you’ll find someone to replace him. You still have a few days.

CHANCE	I've been so caught up in “Operation Romance” that I forgot about “Operation Christmas”.

MR. DAVIS	Ah, romance will do that to a person. So, uh, who’s the special guy?

CHANCE	Special guy? 

MR. DAVIS	Mm.

CHANCE	(laughs) Oh! Oh, no. He’s not special. I mean, he is special, he's just he’s not my special, you know?	

MR. DAVIS	Martha's right: dating is so complicated these days.

CHANCE	Mr. D, how did you know that Martha was going to say yes when you proposed to her?

MR. DAVIS	I just knew. Because she had seen all of me the good and the bad and she still stuck around.

CHANCE	Were you nervous?

MR. DAVIS	Nothing to be nervous about when it’s the right one.

CHANCE	So, how did you sweep her off her feet? What was your big grand gesture for your proposal?

MR. DAVIS	(laughs) Well, we'd just finished doing the dishes at her grandmother’s farmhouse. She was so beautiful. The sun was setting through the window and the way the light hit her face was just... perfect. I looked her in the eye, I got down on one knee and asked her to be my wife right then and there. Didn’t even have a ring, so I picked a thread off the drapes and tied it around her finger. (chuckles)

CHANCE	Wow.

MR. DAVIS	Yeah. I guess it wasn’t grand, or some big romantic proposal, but it was still one of the best memories of my life. I’m one lucky guy.

CHANCE	And she’s one lucky lady.

MR. DAVIS	Ah! I married up. 

CHANCE	(laughs)

MR. DAVIS	Well, better get going. Busiest time of the season. Oh, good luck finding a new Santa.

CHANCE	Thanks, Mr. D.

MR. DAVIS	Bye, uh... dog.

CHANCE 	Yeah. (laughs)

MR. DAVIS	(laughs)

CHANCE	(sighs) 

BECKY	Oh! No.

CHANCE	What about Jerry? What? He's the only actor I know!

BECKY	Again: being an extra in a music video does not make you an actor. Besides, I don’t think I can take another lecture from him on how kids these days just can't appreciate good music.

CHANCE	Well, the jury's still out on that one, huh? 

BECKY	What about Mr. Jackson? Hey? He looks the part.

CHANCE	Jail.

BECKY	Really? It’s always the quiet ones.

CHANCE	Hello?	

WILL	Hey!

CHANCE	Will! Hi! How are you?

WILL	I'm good. How are you?

CHANCE	(sighs) Been better.

WILL	Why? What’s wrong?

CHANCE	I got so caught up in all of this proposal business, that I completely forgot to book my Santa for the toy drive on Saturday and now I’m kind of stuck.

WILL	Oh, well. You need a Santa?

CHANCE	Desperately!

WILL	Well, I can help. I know him personally; had him on speed dial since I was eight.

CHANCE	Really?

WILL	No. Speed dial wasn't around back then.

CHANCE	(laughs) But you can help me find me a replacement?

WILL	Yeah, of course. Just text me time and place. I’ll make sure he shows up. How many reindeer you need?

CHANCE	Reindeers are an option?

WILL	Always.

CHANCE	(laughs) Well, I don't think I have enough room for Rudolph, but, uh, I'll take one Santa, please!

WILL	You got it!

CHANCE	Thank you so much!! This is so important to the kids. You have no idea how much this means to me.

WILL	Well, it's no problem at all. Just happy I could help.

CHANCE	So, what’s up?

WILL	Uh, well, I was just, uh, calling about that book. Uh... did you have any luck yet?

CHANCE	Not yet. But I haven’t met a first edition that I haven’t been able to track down. I’m following some leads and I promise I will get you your first edition of A Christmas Carol by Christmas Eve.

WILL	That's fantastic. Thank you so much.

CHANCE	Hey, did you get my email? What do you think about one last attempt at a night of romance before your big proposal next week?

WILL	Well, I think, uh, third time's a charm.

CHANCE	Great! Then I’ll see you later tonight?

WILL	Sounds good. I'll... I'll see you then. 

BECKY	What's the plan for tonight?

CHANCE	Something a little more classic.

BECKY	Oooh!

BECKY	Is that him?

CHANCE	Hi!

BECKY	Hey!

WILL	Hey there, little buddy! Hey! Did you miss me? I missed you. Got a treat for you. (laughs)

CHANCE	Perfect! You’re on time. Ryan and Leyla are en route, and you look amazing.

WILL	I look amazing?

CHANCE	Did I say that? I meant; this whole thing is amazing!

WILL	Oh! Right. Of course.

BECKY	Uh, hi! I’m Becky. I’ve been helping with the, uh ... the pet sitting. And romance!

WILL	Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. I’ve heard so much about you.

BECKY	Well, Chance does like to brag about how awesome I am.

WILL	Ah, wasn’t Chance. I think you might have another fan.

BECKY	(gasps) Oh, you mean...?

WILL	(chuckles)

BECKY	Ah.

CHANCE	Okay! Let’s focus.

BECKY	Okay.

CHANCE	After you order wine, a musician will come over and serenade you and then you'll give her this gift. It’ll be perfect!

WILL	Great! Sounds a little more classic than your last two attempts. I like it.

CHANCE	Well, a wise man reminded me that it’s not about the grand gestures, but about the moments, the time together. You and Leyla will have a beautiful, quiet, romantic evening enjoying each other’s ompany. The chef knows all of her favourite food and there will not be an ounce of gluten on that menu.


WILL	Sounds good. What’s in the box? 

CHANCE	Oh...

BECKY	Oh, hey, guys! Guys, hide!

CHANCE	Good luck.

WILL	Thank you.

RYAN	Careful.

CHANCE	Becky, what are you doing?

BECKY	I just want to see what Leyla looks like in person.

CHANCE	Are you checking out Leyla, or Ryan?

BECKY	Mmm. Little of column A, little of column B.

CHANCE	(laughs) Thought so.

BECKY	(sighs) So, you and William seem to be getting close.

CHANCE	He’s okay.

BECKY	Oh, ho-ho. I know that face.

CHANCE	What face?

BECKY	The “I’m falling for Mr. He’s okay” face.

CHANCE	I do not have that face.

BECKY	Yes, you do. It looks like this. Mm. "He's okay."

CHANCE	Well, he does look pretty cute tonight.

BECKY	I believe the word you used was "amazing."

CHANCE	I am not falling for that handsome, kind, sweet man that loves dogs.

BECKY	No, of course you’re not.

CHANCE	He’s just the first guy in a long time I’ve enjoyed talking to.

BECKY	Yeah. Totally believe you. Oh. (gasps) Okay, it’s Ryan. He’s off for the rest of the night. He's going to take me to the History of Video Games exhibit.

CHANCE	Mm-mm. And he claims he’s not good at romance.

BECKY	No, this isn't ro it's not romantic. He he and I? We're just, like, we're friends who... What?	

CHANCE	Oh! That face?

BECKY	Okay. I will see you tomorrow. Bye. (kissing sound)

CHANCE	Have fun!

CHANCE	I told you we’d nail this one. The classics always work. Come on. Let's go.

LEYLA	As I was saying before that musical interlude: Maggie wants me in Prague by Thursday at the latest because the photographer is only available on Friday.

WILL	Thursday's Christmas Eve. The photographer's only available on Christmas day?

LEYLA	Well, he books up year-round. He'd be doing her a huge favor by squeezing us in.

WILL	On Christmas Day?

LEYLA	Well, I would still be around Christmas Eve-ish. I just have to leave a little earlier than I hoped.	

WILL	Um... Yeah, but, Leyla, we're supposed to spend Christmas with my sister.

LEYLA	Bring her! It’ll be great.

WILL	She has a husband and three kids. Remember?

LEYLA	Bring them, too.

WILL	Leyla, it’s it's Christmas. Don’t you, uh, want to spend it at home with me and our families?	

LEYLA	Well, of course I do. I just can’t pass up this opportunity. You understand that career comes first at this point in our lives, right?

WILL	Yeah, I I do. But, um, what if I want our careers to come a very close second to our relationship now? And to family?

LEYLA	Well, I would say that’s... very sweet. Unrealistic at this time. But sweet.

WILL	(sighs) Realistic at some point?

LEYLA	Yeah. At some point.

WILL	Haven’t opened your present yet. (chuckles)

LEYLA	Is it a tennis bracelet?

WILL	It’s a... surprise!

LEYLA	I love surprises! (chuckles; gasps) Will! A Tennis bracelet! I love it! How did you know? 

WILL	Guess I just know that you like shiny new things.

LEYLA	(laughs) It's beautiful. Thank you.

CHANCE	Well, No-Name, I think you’re going to have a new home soon. I gotta tell you: we’re going to miss you around these parts. But don’t worry! You’re going to a beautiful home. And Will and Leyla? They're going to take such great care of you! And you can come visit anytime you want. It's my turn. Okay, enough feeling sorry for ourselves. Time to bury these feelings deep down. We have a big day tomorrow. Let's go home!

CHANCE	Hi, Mr. Davis!

MR. DAVIS	Hi, Chance. Becky?

BECKY	Hey!

CHANCE	Thanks for coming.

MR. DAVIS	Oh, wouldn't miss it.

CHANCE	Have a seat anywhere.

MR. DAVIS	Okay. Go on, guys.

CHANCE	Where is he?

BECKY	Ah, he’ll be here.

CHANCE	It starts in a few minutes and Santa is nowhere to be found.

BECKY	At least you have a reindeer.

CHANCE	That's not helpful. But he is pretty adorable, isn’t he?

BECKY	So adorable! Have you tried texting Will?

CHANCE	Five times. He promised me his Santa wouldn’t be late.

WILL	Ho. Ho. Ho.

BECKY	Isn’t... that...?

CHANCE	Oh. My.

WILL	Merry Christmas, everyone! Comet! There you are, dear boy. I wondered where you ran off to. Dasher and Blitzen have been looking everywhere for you! Ho. Ho. Ho.

CHANCE	Comet?

BECKY	Oh no. He named the dog! (sighs)

KID #1	Hey, Santa! Did you get my letter?

WILL	You bet I did! And I see you’re being such a good boy and bringing a special gift to give to someone else less fortunate.

KID #1	It’s one of my favourites. Do you think they’ll like it?

WILL	I know they will. It’s little boys and girls like you with big hearts that make Christmas so very special. Now who would like to hear Santa read a Christmas story?

AUDIENCE MEMBERS	(cheering)

CHANCE	Thank. You.

BECKY	Smile!

WOMAN (SINGING)	You make Christmas You make my wishes come true With your mistletoe kisses Yeah... Baby, I don't need no...

CHANCE	Well, that went well.

WILL	Ho-ho-ho.

BECKY	All right, you guys, I’m going to go out and grab us some coffees. Santa, how do you take it?

CHANCE	Don’t tell her. Her ratio of guessing your order is much better than her stats on actually remembering what you want.

WILL	All right. Mystery coffee it is!

BECKY	All right. Comet, come on! Let’s go for a walk. Hey, yeah.

CHANCE	Comet, huh?

WILL	Yeah, yeah, I’m Santa, he’s obviously part reindeer so, yeah, I think Comet suits him perfectly!	

CHANCE	I like it! But I’m still a little confused as to why you’re Santa? I thought you were getting me the “real” Santa.

WILL	Uh, turns out he’s pretty busy this time of year.

CHANCE	Mm, I see.

WILL	And he got food poisoning and had to cancel again. I couldn’t let you down, so, you know, called in a few favors, got this very flattering Santa outfit and... voila!

CHANCE	Well, I must day, it is quite flattering. Have you lost weight?

WILL	Umm, yeah. Just a little.

WILL	Wow. That’s really bloomed. It must like it here. It must like you.

CHANCE	A lot of good energy in here.

WILL	Yeah, I can sense that. So, what’s your all-time favorite thing in here?

CHANCE	Old books!

WILL	Of course. I’m guessing you’re not the type of person to trade in their entire home library for a tablet?

CHANCE	Never! I don't know. There’s just something about holding an old book that’s been read by various people over a number of decades. Sometimes I think about all the different lives and families and times. We're all so different, but in that one moment in time we're all experiencing the exact same journey. The best is when you find old books with inscriptions in them. Notes from loved ones. From husbands to wives, friends, parents to their children... All because they want that person to enjoy those pages and that journey as much as they did when they read it. It’s magical.

WILL	Yeah, I guess it is.

CHANCE	What about you? You a tablet guy or old books?

WILL	Tablet.

CHANCE	Really? Then why are you so focused on finding “A Christmas Carol” for Leyla? Just buy her a tablet and program all your favorite books in it.

WILL	Uh, guess because, you know, the memory of reading that all together as family over Christmas holidays as a kid is kind of the last memory I have of all of us together.

CHANCE	Will, I’m sorry, I didn’t know.

WILL	It's okay. My mom, she got pretty sick the following year and that tradition died with her. So, when I start my own family, I want that tradition to live on.

CHANCE	Lifetimes apart... but same journey.

WILL	Yeah. Yeah, we have a lot in common. Chance, I wanted to thank you so much for helping me. Not with the engagement but with everything. I’ve really learned a lot about myself the past week.

CHANCE	You have?

WILL	Yeah, when we talk, it's like you actually see me. Not, you know, the Will that people read in the papers or on social media. But it's like you see who I am on the inside. I didn't even think I even knew who that was until I met you.

CHANCE	Well, I’m glad. Because the real you is pretty great.

WILL	It’s such a strange feeling.

CHANCE	What is?

WILL	Spending time with someone who doesn’t want or need anything from the “William Richards” in my bio.

CHANCE	You should let more people see the real you.

WILL	Well, people see what they want to see. But when you look at me, it’s like you see right through me. Past the image.

CHANCE	Will, I

BECKY	All right, I went out on a limb with one cream one milk-Oh... Am I interrupting something?

WILL	Um, I should get going.

BECKY	Black coffee?

WILL	Well, she is good at guessing.

CHANCE	I told you.

BECKY	You have to go right away?

WILL	Yeah, I gotta get going. You know, the sleigh is double-parked and if I get another ticket, Mrs. Claus is going to kill me. Uh, the big red bag there is full of brand-new toys for the kids.

CHANCE	Wow, really? You didn’t have to do that. Thank you so much.

WILL	My pleasure. C’mon, Comet, you ready to fly?

CHANCE	Oh, yeah. Wait, you’re taking Comet?

WILL	Yeah, we’ve imposed enough.

CHANCE	Oh, he’s no imposition. We’ve actually gotten really used to the little fur ball.

WILL	I think it’s time to be true to my own feelings, you know. Be the real me. I want Comet in my life, and I think if Leyla just spends a little bit of time with him, she’ll start to realize that there’s more to life than just her career too.

CHANCE	I see. 

WILL	Uh, so I guess I'll see you on Christmas Eve for the big proposal? Just keep in mind that Leyla flies out that night so everything will have to be ready before she goes to the airport.

CHANCE	It’ll be perfect.

WILL	Okay. I completely forgot to find out her ring size?

CHANCE	Oh, six-point-five.

WILL	How do you know that?

CHANCE	I snuck into her room while she was sleeping and measured.

WILL	Sorry, what?

CHANCE	I’m kidding! I called her best friend, Jolene, and asked about her favorite nail salon, she goes there once a week. What? They see hundreds of hands every week. They are very accurate at guessing ring sizes.

WILL	Yeah, but how did you know that I needed it?

CHANCE	Oh, well, Ryan figured that you might need a little help discreetly finding that out.

WILL	Ha-ha-ha. You and I make a good team!

CHANCE	Yeah, we do.

WILL	Bye.

CHANCE	Bye.

WILL	Come on.

BECKY	He just had to name the dog!

CHANCE	I told you!!

MR. DAVIS	Last delivery of the night.

CHANCE	Mr. Davis! Thanks again for dropping by with Jonie today. I hope you had fun.

MR. DAVIS	It was wonderful. I knew you’d find a perfect replacement Santa.

CHANCE	He was pretty great. And now, I can thank him with this!! Oh, no!

MR. DAVIS	What is it, dear?

CHANCE	This is the wrong book! I ordered a first edition copy of “A Christmas Carol”, this is a biography of Carol Christmas!

MR. DAVIS	Oh dear.

CHANCE	What am I going to do? Will needs this for Christmas Eve!

MR. DAVIS	I’m sorry, Chance. You know how crazy it gets this time of year. Look, I’m sure he’ll understand. Okay, it was an honest mistake. If you package it up, I’ll have it returned. And, have a Merry Christmas, okay?

CHANCE	You too. Thanks. 

CHANCE	Captain Bubbles, what am I going to do? Well, you’re no help. What? No, that’s crazy!

CHANCE 	Hi, Chris? Hi, it’s Chance from By Chance gifts. Yes, remember that big favor I helped you with last summer, well, I was wondering if you could help me locate a first edition of “A Christmas Carol” for Christmas Eve. No, of course I understand. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Well, that didn't work.

CHANCE	What is going on?

BECKY	Merry Christmas.

CHANCE	Ooh, oh. I'll go this way.

CHANCE 	What’s going on? I got like a million emails from customers last night wanting to buy Christmas gifts.

BECKY	I know, isn’t it amazing? Look at this place, it’s packed.

CHANCE	Hi. How did this happen?

BECKY	I told you we could do it! I posted a picture of yesterday's toy drive on your blog and it went viral.	

CHANCE	My little toy drive went viral? 

BECKY	Mm-hm.

CHANCE	How? Why? What does that even mean?

BECKY	Thanks. When people got a look at the most “Eligible bachelor of the year” dressed up as Santa Claus, reading to a group of kids - it didn’t take long for your store to make it to the top of everyone’s wish list for Christmas.

CHANCE	What do you mean everyone? How many people saw the blog?

BECKY	Oh, everyone!

CHANCE	Oh, no!

WILL	So, most manufacturers that try to use Italian silk, and because the overhead on that is so Much	

LEYLA	Good Morning, Will.	

WILL	Leyla! How was your interview this morning?

LEYLA	Oh. It was lovely. Although the magazine wanted to know all about my boyfriend who was dressed up as Santa reading a book to children in a store owned by a woman who looked an awful lot like Olivia.

WILL	Oh-oh.

RYAN	Yeah, I’ll be somewhere else.

LEYLA	And the funny thing is, well, it wasn’t Olivia at all, but a girl named Chance who is not from England by the way and I’m guessing isn't your father’s best friend’s daughter.

WILL	I can explain.

LEYLA	You lied to me.

WILL	I know but it's not

LEYLA	You brought a woman into your home, lied to me about who she was and then you go around playing Santa for her toy drive without telling me. Do you know how embarrassed I was when I realized that I was talking about a fictional girl and the magazine had to correct me on who she was?

WILL	I’m sorry.

LEYLA	You’re sorry? This is my career, Will. I can just imagine the rumors that are going to come out of this fiasco. What about our image?

WILL	Let’s go grab a coffee. I'll explain everything.

LEYLA	I don’t want to hear it. And what is this mutt still doing here? I thought I told you to bring him back.

WILL	She didn’t mean it.

BECKY	How did you not tell Will that the photos we were taking were for the blog?

CHANCE	How was I supposed to know?

BECKY	Asking permission is social media etiquette 101.

CHANCE	This is so complicated. I've ruined everything.

BECKY	No, it's not your fault. You didn’t do anything wrong, okay? I should have made sure you asked Will. I mean, of all people, Will should understand the power of social media. We had no control over this going viral. I mean, you have like three subscribers and two of them are me and the “all-knowing Gabby” - my alias. Thank you. How could we have known this would happen?

CHANCE	Wasn’t this the goal? To get customers in here? He’s going to think that I used him to for publicity... and he’s right. Can you handle this for a moment? I need to get some air. Oh.

BECKY	Hi. Yes, can I help you?

CHANCE	Excuse me. Thank you.

CHANCE	Will!

WILL	I see business has picked up... Glad I could help.

CHANCE	Will, I’m so sorry.

WILL	I just came to pay you for the work you did on the proposal and to pick up the book. I won’t be needing your help anymore.

CHANCE	Will, let me explain. I had no idea that Becky was going to post those photos on the blog. She does all this pre-programming, and I didn’t realize.

WILL	I just thought you were different. I never thought you’d use me to get what you want. Now I'm seeing you’re just like everyone else.

CHANCE	That’s not fair. I didn’t mean to do this. Let me make this up to you. Let me make tomorrow night the best Christmas Eve proposal ever.

WILL	I don't think so. Leyla's not even talking to me right now, Chance. Please, just get me the book and go back to your customers.

CHANCE	There was a mistake, and the book didn’t come in. It was a different book, but I promise I’m doing everything that I can to get you another copy

WILL	You know what? It was a stupid idea. Leyla likes shiny new things, not a stupid old book.

CHANCE	What time is it?

BECKY	Uh, 10:20.

CHANCE	Perfect.

BECKY	Why? Hey, Chance, a little help over here. 

FEMALE CUSTOMER	Hi.	

BECKY	What are you doing?

CHANCE	Fixing what we broke. I need you to hold down the fort here for a few hours.

BECKY	Uh, but it's like really busy here.

CHANCE	I know. Thank you!

BECKY	IThanks.

MANICURIST	Can I help you, Miss?

CHANCE	No. Yes. Maybe? I’m looking for Leyla Brooks. I’m the one who called regarding “the ring finger”.

MANICURIST	Oh! Yes. The ring finger. How is that going?

CHANCE	There’s been a minor glitch. Is she here?

MANICURIST	Yes, she's actually my next client.

CHANCE	Oh, there she is. Just going to borrow this. Leyla! I’m really glad I found you.

LEYLA	What are you doing here, Olivia? Or is it Chance? Or is that a fake name too?

MANICURIST	I'm just going to give you guys some privacy.

CHANCE	It’s Chance. And I came here to explain everything. It’s not what you think.

LEYLA	Really? Because what I think is my boyfriend's been lying to me about who you are and the two of you have been sneaking around behind my back.

CHANCE	Okay, it’s partly what you think.

LEYLA	What do you want and how did you even find me here?

CHANCE	Long story.

LEYLA	You have 30 seconds.

CHANCE	30 seconds? Okay, then, long story short. Will found my business card and contacted me to help him create the most romantic week for you leading up to Christmas.

LEYLA	What? Why?

CHANCE	Because he wanted... To make this Christmas really special for you. He knows how hard you’ve been working, and he wanted to do something special to show you how proud he is of you.

LEYLA	Oh. But why were you at my party pretending to be someone else?


CHANCE	Well, my first attempt with the dog didn’t go exactly as planned so he wanted me to get to know you so I could plan something really special.

LEYLA	The dog was your idea. Okay, time’s up.

CHANCE	Leyla, c’mon. Will loves you and wants to make you the happiest woman in the world. He wasn’t trying to lie to you. He was trying to do something special. It just... It didn’t work out.

LEYLA	And why was he at your store dressed up as Santa Claus?

CHANCE	Because my regular Santa was out of town and I asked him for help. He tried to book someone, but they got food poisoning the night before and he didn’t want to let me down. Leyla, Will is an amazing guy and he loves you so much. Please, just meet him at this address tomorrow night at 6 PM before your flight.

LEYLA	Did he really hire you to make this Christmas special for me?

CHANCE	Yes. You got the tennis bracelet you always wanted, didn’t you?

LEYLA	Okay, you’re forgiven for the dog. I really do love the bracelet.

CHANCE	Meet him tomorrow night. Please. Oh, and give him this.

LEYLA	What is it?

CHANCE	It's something he’ll love. It's something that will mean a lot coming from you. Trust me.

LEYLA	Okay, I’ll be there.

CHANCE	Thank you. And Merry Christmas.


LEYLA	An old book? What kind of Christmas present is that?

RADIO VOICE 	Merry Christmas Eve, listeners! I hope you’re all having a fabulous day and spending it with family and friends. Here’s one of my favorite songs to kick off tonight’s countdown to Christmas!

CHANCE	Thank you. 

RYAN	What's next?

CHANCE	Why don't you start on that one?

RYAN	Okay.

CHANCE	Bring me more lights.

RYAN	More lights. On it.

BECKY	Chance, you need to relax. Okay, this place looks beautiful.

CHANCE	I can’t. It needs to be perfect.

BECKY	Hey, what’s going on? Leyla knows the truth now. And the whole blog fiasco was an honest mishap - a happy mishap for the store, by the way, but still it wasn’t meant to hurt anyone. I’m sure, deep down, Will knows this too.

CHANCE	I just... I really like him, Becky. I feel like I let him down.

BECKY	If he’s really as great a guy as you say he is, I'm sure he’ll realize it was just a miscommunication and you’ll still be friends after all this.

CHANCE	Yeah, friends...

BECKY	And that is the root of the problem. You are in love with him.

CHANCE	No, I’m not.

BECKY	Chance, you’re so upset over Will you haven’t even realized the store is back in business which is the whole reason you started working with Will in the first place.

CHANCE	Of course, I’m happy about that. I just didn’t want the price to be Will’s happiness.

BECKY	It’s not. They’re going to be fine, okay? You work so hard for everyone else. Your intentions were good. This... this will blow over. You don’t need to overdo it, okay? Their relationship should be able to stand on its own. And, you know, it’s not a perfect proposal that creates the perfect marriage. If they're really meant to be, it shouldn’t matter how he proposes.

CHANCE	I know. And, just for the record, I am not overdoing it.

RYAN	Is this enough lights?

CHANCE	Now we’re talking!

BECKY	(laughter) Oh, my goodness. How did you get this?

WILL	Where did I go wrong, comet, hm? I know. I over-reacted to the whole thing. I just thought if I created this perfect week for Leyla, she'd see how great we are together and she would want what I want, you know? Yeah, I know. You know what the funny thing is, it's like the more I tried, the more we seemed to fall apart. And the more time I spent with Chance, the more time I felt like myself. What? What? It's like you’re trying to tell me something. Man, I wish I spoke dog.

BECKY	Mountain lion, mountain lion, can you hear me?

RYAN	Yep. Ten-four.

CHANCE	Okay, let’s go over the plan one more time!

RYAN	We’ve got this Chance!

CHANCE	Becky?

BECKY	Okay, so, in exactly five minutes Ryan calls Will and tells him that Leyla wants to meet him here to talk things through.

RYAN	Then I stand watch with a walkie and let you know when they arrive. If Will gets here first, I stall him.

BECKY	And we just hope that Leyla shows up!

CHANCE	She said she’d be here. Ryan, do you have Will’s mother’s wedding ring sized and ready?

RYAN	I’ve been guarding it with my life for the past two weeks.

CHANCE	Perfect! Have it on standby.

RYAN	You got it!

BECKY	And then, when they're both here, I cue the snow and the romantic music.

CHANCE	I think we’re ready.

BECKY	Do you think this is going to work?

CHANCE	I think that when two people are meant to be together, love always finds a way.

BECKY	Mountain lion, are you ready?

RYAN	(imitates lion roar) Lion out.

WILL	Well, better go pack. It's a long trip ahead of us. Don't worry, she'll love you.

RYAN	C’mon, answer! Come on, come on, pick up, pick up. Come on, come on. Come on, just ring-ring-ring, come on, come on, pick up. Pick up, answer, come on.

BECKY	Hey, what’s going on?

RYAN	He’s not answering. He's not picking up, he’s not answering

BECKY	Sh-sh, okay. Okay, uh, I’ll keep Chance busy, you just keep trying, okay!

RYAN	Okay, all right, come on, okay, pick up, pick up, come on!

BECKY	Shh. Ryan.

RYAN	Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, come on, Will, come on.

BECKY	Oh, I wanted to ask you about these. Um, did you want them red?

WILL	Come in. Leyla?


LEYLA	Hey. Do you have a second?

WILL	Yeah, yeah, come on in, please.

LEYLA	Did you decide to come to Prague with me?

WILL	Oh. No. Sorry, I was packing to go to my sister’s for Christmas, remember?

LEYLA	Right, yeah. Of course.

WILL	Hey, I am so glad you're here right now because I just wanted to apologize for this past week. I tried to create this perfect romantic week for you and...

LEYLA	I know. I heard.

WILL	Ryan fill you in?

LEYLA	Something like that.

WILL	I just thought if I created this perfect week for you, that maybe you’d want what I want.

LEYLA	And what is that, Will? Because I thought we wanted all of the same things, but now I’m not sure anymore.

WILL	What do you mean?

LEYLA	I mean, suddenly you want a dog and you’d rather spend Christmas with your sister and her kids than with me in Prague.

WILL	Well, no, no. I want to spend Christmas with you. Just not at a photo shoot surrounded by strangers.	

LEYLA	But that’s our lives.

WILL	But what if I want more than that? You know, settle down a little bit. Maybe change priorities, work on our relationship, spend less time on our careers.

LEYLA	You love your career. And I love mine.

WILL	But what if there’s more to life than that. What if there's more to me than that.

LEYLA	Will, I love you. But I’m just not ready to compromise my life right now.

WILL	What are you saying?

LEYLA	Maybe we're just not good together anymore. Your Christmas present.

WILL	Leyla, this is the most thoughtful gift you could have gotten me. See, see, this is why we're so good together. I was trying to find you this exact book. Where did you find this?

LEYLA	I didn’t. And to tell you the truth, I have no idea why that book is even important to you. Will, Chance gave that to me. Someone you’ve known for a week knows you way better than I ever have. The dog, the book, the toy drive, the settling down... That’s just not me. And up until today, I had no idea it was even you. You know, maybe I fell in love with your image and not the real you. And I’m so sorry for that. But the career, Christmas in Prague, jet-setting around the world, that's the real me. And I love it.

WILL	Leyla...

LEYLA	I’m sorry, Will. Merry Christmas.

CHANCE	(sighs) What time is it?

BECKY	Five minutes later than the last time you asked.

CHANCE	What time was Leyla’s flight?

RYAN	35 minutes ago.

CHANCE	Any chance she got the times messed up?

RYAN	Zero.

CHANCE	And has Will ever taken this long to return a call before?

RYAN	I’m sorry, Chance. You worked so hard on this.

CHANCE	I can’t believe they didn’t show up. I ruined their big engagement.

RYAN	Look, I’m no expert on love or romance but do you remember why I passed on this romantic assignment?

CHANCE	Because you didn’t want to be the one to blame if it all fell apart.

RYAN	Exactly. I had a feeling this wouldn’t end well. And you are not to blame. Miss Brooks has never seen Will for who he truly is. Yeah, she's a lovely woman but they were never meant to be.	

BECKY	Are you sure you’re not the expert on romance?

CHANCE	Thank you, Ryan. I still feel terrible.

RYAN	C’mon, we’ll help you take this down and we can all go grab some pizza. 

BECKY	Yeah.

RYAN	Yeah, there’s a great spot just up the street.

CHANCE	It’s okay. You guys go ahead. I need to be alone for a little while.

BECKY	Are you sure?

CHANCE	Yeah.

BECKY	Okay.

CHANCE	It would have been romantic.

WILL	I know, you don't need to say anything. I know I messed up and I don't want to talk about it. What's up? What, this? 

WILL	For my beautiful daughter, Chance. Love always and forever, Dad.

WILL	This is Chance’s copy. She just gave me the book that her father gave to her. 

WILL	Thanks, buddy.

CHANCE	Hello? Excuse me? I’m not done yet. I rented this space for the whole evening so could you please put the power back on? What is going on?

CHANCE 	Will? You came? Oh, my gosh, I’m so sorry this is a disaster... Leyla was supposed to show up and this was supposed to be your big romantic moment, and everything was supposed to work out and..

WILL	Chance?

CHANCE	Yes?

WILL	I love that you talk a lot when you’re nervous.

CHANCE	You do? I do talk a lot when I’m nervous, but, I mean, no, I’m not nervous. Leyla was supposed to be here before you and now I’m not even sure if she’s coming but I...

WILL	And Chance...

CHANCE	Yeah?

WILL	I love that you know everything about me without even trying.

CHANCE	Well, you’re really easy to get to know.

WILL	Well, that’s the thing, I’m not easy to get to know. I’ve spent my whole life around people who think they know me, but they only got to know who I pretended to be. My image. But when you look at me, you see right past all the facade and you see the real me.

CHANCE	Well, I like the real you.

WILL	And I love that you put others before yourself. You gave me the book that your father gave you as a child just because you thought it would help me save my relationship.

CHANCE	Did it? Save your relationship?

WILL	No. It didn’t. Because Leyla isn’t the one that I’m supposed to share that journey with. This is for you.

CHANCE	A single white rose. Spiritual love.

WILL	Soulmates. I’m really sorry I didn’t see it before now, Chance. True love was right in front of me this entire time.

CHANCE	Aww. Hi, Comet. I see you got a little help.

WILL	Yeah, we all make a pretty good team.

CHANCE	Yes, we do.
