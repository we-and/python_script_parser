THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching..? THE EARL OF SODOR	...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen.THE EARL OF SODOR     Percy is travelling at night and his lamp has lit up a sign by the side of the track.THE EARL OF SODOR     It's a danger sign telling Percy to stop, because there may be rock-falls ahead. THE EARL OF SODOR	But naughty James isn't looking at the sign.  THE EARL OF SODOR	Are you ready for the first question?THE EARL OF SODOR	What shape was the danger sign? Was it a square? Was it a triangle? Or was it a circle (round)?THE EARL OF SODOR	The danger sign was a triangle shape! It had 3 sides. THE EARL OF SODOR	James was very silly to go past the danger sign. Luckily, brave Percy rescued him from the falling rocks.THE EARL OF SODOR	Hooray that was fun! Let's play again.THE EARL OF SODOR	Connor is a very fast engine and loves to race. Today he's racing Bill. But it doesn't matter how fast you are, you need to stop when the signal is red.THE EARL OF SODOR	Conner watch out! You're about to bump into someone! Oh, my! That was close. THE EARL OF SODOR	Which engine did Connor nearly bump into? Was it James? Was it Gordon? Or was it Henry?THE EARL OF SODOR	Connor nearly bumped into Henry! Which gave him a bit of a shock! And I think Connor's learnt he needs to stop when he's told. THE EARL OF SODOR	Now he's waiting at the red signal. It's changed to green and off he goes. THE EARL OF SODOR	Jolly Well done! Do come back again soon. Goodbye!
