PIPER		[sigh] Are you sure our boy's going to show?

PIPER 		This isn't exactly his neighborhood, Goldie.

GOLDILOCKS	This isn't home for us either, Piper.

PIPER		Back home this guy is the biggest of the big baddies.

PIPER	I know people who wouldn't even say his name out of fear that they would lose their firstborn.

PIPER		Pss.

PIPER		What kind of name is Rumpelstiltskin anyway.

ALICE		Alright, you two, stay mum. Here he comes, the squarely bugger.

ALICE 	Remember, Piper, dear- He's expecting a dealer named Hans to give him a piece of the magic mirror. And where he goes. Death's Messengers are never far behind.

RUMPEL	Where's Hans?

PIPER		Couldn't make it.

PIPER		He sent me.

PIPER		I'm Piper.

RUMPEL	Did - did you bring it?

PIPER		It's nearby. You fiending, pal?

GOLDILOCKS	Careful, Piper.

RUMPEL	If you know Hans, then you know why I need it.

PIPER		Sure. Sure.

PIPER		You're running out of juice and you need a taste of the good stuff.

PIPER		Grade "A" magic mirror. Ground up for? What do you snort it?

RUMPEL	Do you have it?!

PIPER		Anything for Rumpelstiltskin--

RUMPEL	Hey Sshh! Sshh! Don't move.

PIPER		This is new.

RUMPELS	Where is it, huh? Where is it!

PIPER		I told you, it's nearby.

GOLDILOCKS	Alice.

ALICE 		Piper's fine. Stay put. I don't want him in that blonde head of yours, too.

RUMPEL	Where did you hear that name?

PIPER		Hans.

RUMPEL	You're lying. Hans would never tell you that name, do you know why? Because I told him not to. Just like I can tell you to give me what I need.

PIPER		Then do it.

RUMPEL	Give it to me now!

PIPER		Uh, oh. [laughs]

PIPER		You lost your juice, pal?

RUMPEL	No, no, no, no, no, no, not now. Who sent you? Was it them?

PIPER		Who is them?

DEATH		Rumpelstiltskin.

GOLDILOCKS	Alice somethings happening.

ALICE 		It's him. Death or one of his messengers. His powers are gone! After him!

GOLDILOCKS	He can't move.

PIPER		[groans]

DEATH		Did you think you can hide from him?

PIPER		[grunts]

DEATH	You were supposed to bring him the magic mirror. You broke it. And you cheated him. Death doesn't like to be cheated.

RUMPEL	[laughing] Next time tell him to read the fine print.

DEATH		Tell him yourself. [chocking / gaging]

TWEEDLEDEE	Alice, blood.

ALICE	Curiouser and curiouser. We've made a delightful mess of things, haven't we? Let's not dally, now. It's through the Looking Glass for you.

RUMPEL	No, no, no, no.

HATTER 	[coughing] Is this thing on? Hats off to our newly arrived guest. I'm sure you have oh so many questions, but for now, a word of the device: Don't try too terribly hard to keep your head -- Someone would say, to survive here-- You'd have to be mad as a Hatter.

ALICE	Most people think me quite mad. Monsters and magic. Uncommon nonsense they say. Perhaps I am mad. Why sometimes I've believed as many as 6 impossible things before breakfast. But... I've seen wonder, and mad or not, you're quite real. Someone needs to make sure you're not being naughty. After all, It was you who turned the fabric of reality into something not unlike Swiss cheese, I'm afraid. So sorry you're unable to speak. I preferred to be absolutely certain you've lost your powers of persuasion, be for loosening up that silver tongue of yours.

HATTER	A reminder, dear Alice, our good at Piper's just returned from a jaunt at the zoo and he's brought a guest. And Miss Goldilocks stepped out for her date. When she returns we'll be near to bursting and all before tea time! See as your restrained, I'm sure I needn't tell you but keep your appendages appended by keeping them to yourself. Else they're like to be bit off by what's behind below.

ALICE	Ah, yes your new cell mate, as it were. This big baddie was our first recruit. That's a good, Wolfie. First of many!

HATTER 	before I remember, will one of the twiddles please forget to give the good doggie a proper housing? That little lemon's gone  a tad ripe.

ALICE	As you can see, Your meddling's brought all sorts of grim beasties and monsters from your world to mine. Unfortunately, you've also let something else in. Something worse. A cult. Armed and working for Death himself. Death's messengers, I think you know them. Judging by your friend in the alleyway. They're planning something and it's up to us to stop them.

ALICE		I'll be clear.

ALICE	Whether I allow you to speak or not depends entirely on what you're willing to say. Tell me everything you know about these messengers. If you cooperate I can make your stay here a tad more comfortable. Perhaps even you won't have to eat through a straw for the rest of your life, hmm? Otherwise, breaking that magic mirror will bring you more than just seven years bad luck, I'm afraid. We'll keep rounding up monsters. You can decide whether you want to be one or not Blink twice if you've understood me. And blink twice if we have a deal. Hmm. Suit yourself. I'll leave you to think about it.

PIPER 		You sure you want to go alone, Goldie?

GOLDILOCKS	He's expecting an escort. I don't want him running off before I have a chance to take him in.

PIPER 		Don't think this guy scares easily, you'd be lucky to land one hit.

GOLDILOCKS	One is all I need. How tough could he be, with a name like Bluebeard?

BLUEBEARD	[laughter] I asked for a brunette.

GOLDILOCKS	[groans efforts]

BLUEBEARD	Ha! Ha! Naughty little girl.

GOLDILOCKS	Blondes have more fun.

BLUEBEARD	Ah, we'll see. Ah. Yes, you've met my wives. No one's ever... hit me before. You must be special. Yea, [laughs] I'm going to take my time.

GOLDILOCKS	Better hurry up then. I knew I only had one shot to land a hit. So I made count. Poison should only take a minute or two. Give or take.

ALICE		Alright, bring them in.

PIPER		Rumpelstiltskin, yeah, his mouth definitely was one of ours.

GOLDILOCKS	Where we're from he's a bit of a boogeyman. A powerbroker. Literally, actually. Traded influence for favors. Delusions of grandeur, for sure, But never quite got power of his own. A whisper from him and a King would hand over his crown. An army would retreat.

PIPER	At least that was before he broke the magic mirror. It was a gateway between worlds. He could've use it to go anywhere. But he broke it. [laughs] Somehow tied himself to it and he needs it or he is powerless.

GOLDILOCKS	Honestly, I don't get it. If his powers aren't working then he's just a glorified con-man. Why do you want him?

ALICE	It's not what he can do that I'm interested in, it's what he knows.. Who he knows. I'm convinced he wants something from these messengers. Or perhaps more likely, that they want something from him.

PIPER	Yeah. Yeah, he was pretty spooked back in the alley. I got to go with Alice on this one, Goldie.

GOLDILOCKS	If you say so.

ALICE		Who's next?

PIPER	The big bad Wolf. Got a temper on him. Didn't recognize him from back home, but I know the type. Found him at the zoo, of all places.

GOLDILOCKS	He was eating the animals.

PIPER	You didn't see what he did to those poor little pigs. Took six tranq darts just to bring him down. [laughs] Thought I was going to lose my head.

GOLDILOCKS	[laughs]

PIPER		What? You've seen worse?

GOLDILOCKS	I've lived with worse.

PIPER		Hmm.

GOLDILOCKS	Goes by Bluebeard, obvious reasons. He has a set of blades he calls his wives. Somehow it makes him stronger every time he kills someone. When I picked one up I could feel the life force of everyone he killed. Almost like it was flowing through me making me stronger.

PIPER		But he only kills women?

GOLDILOCKS	A lot of them.

BLUEBEARD	Is that you in there, Goldie?

BLUEBEARD	Huh?

ALICE		Oh, he quite fancies you, doesn't he?

BLUEBEARD	Yes, it is you. Since those bears didn't tear you apart, come sleep in my bed, Goldie.

PIPER		You okay with him being here?

BLUEBEARD	[deep inhale / exhale] Goldie.

GOLDILOCKS	He doesn't scare me. When I signed up for this, it was to get rid of guys like this, not start a collection.

ALICE	Fire with fire and all of that. If we were to be beat these messengers, sooner or later, we'll need some monsters of her own.

BLUEBEARD	It's only a matter of time.  [whispers] Yes.

ALICE	It's a start. Get back out there, you too. We've reports of missing persons turning up half eaten.  If I had to guess I'd say 'witch'. If possible, I'd have you find her before her next meal.

PIPER		[scoffs] It smells like the place.

GOLDILOCKS	I hate witches. Careful, Piper. We're here to catch a witch.

PIPER		Table for two, huh.

GOLDILOCKS	She shouldn't be far from whatever this is.

PIPER	Goldie, he's a Messenger. What would a witch want with one of Death's Messengers?  [screaming]

GOLDILOCKS	Piper! Hold still!  [screaming]

CARABOSSE	He's MIIIINE!

DEATH	Oh, I'm sorry am interrupting? Do I know you? Looking Glass, right? Am I right? Hi I'm Death. Reaper of souls, Nice to meet you in the flesh. Well, in this guy's flesh.

DEATH		Tell Alice I said Hi.

CARABOSSE	My love.

WITCH		You're here. You heard me. And now we can be together.

WITCH		Hmm.

DEATH	And who might you be? You killed one of my messengers, didn't you? You did, didn't you? Naughty girl. Yeah.

CARABOSSE	I - I - I dreamt of you, my love. Of a new underworld. Where every sould on earth suffers.  [gasping]

DEATH		Sshh. It takes a certain kind of crazy to court Death.

CARABOSSE	I only wanted [gasping]... to help.

DEATH		I think you have.

PIPER		Mission accomplished.

GOLDILOCKS	Let's bag her up.

HATTER 	Ladies, gentlemen, and men. May we welcome another guest to the party.

CARABOSSE	[efforts  / grunts throughout]

HATTER 	Apologies for the neck restraint. Makes you much less, munchier than you were before.

PIPER		Her name is Carabosse.

GOLDILOCKS	Cannibal witch. I - I Don't even know where to start. She's in love with Death. He knew who you were, and who we were. Somehow she was able to help him possess a Messenger corpse. Alice, Death, seemed almost happy to see us.

ALICE		Then let's figure out if she's part of Death's plan. Clock's ticking, after all.

CARABOSSE	[spits]

ALICE		Oh, Splendid. We're making an impression.

CARABOSSE	[growling]  [whispering, echo] Hellooo, Rumpelstiltskin.…I found you.

ALICE	Ah, there you are. I'd like to show you something. For months now, we have been chasing down these messengers while you've been running around for what's left of that mirror. There's nothing magical about you at all, is there? Picked this up from one of their nasty little rituals. I suspect you know what it is. What it can do? I'd like you to tell me so we have some chance of stopping them.  [chuckles] I've had my suspicions. You've run dry. Why else would you be so desperate to get your hands on that little bit of extra power. Unless there's something out there that scares you more than me?

BLUEBEARD	I like this one. She's feisty. Good little pets. Yes.

TWEEDLEDEE	I'm comin'…
BLUEBEARD	Ah, yes my little pet.

TWEEDLEDUM	Good night.

PIPER		Good night, Twiddle..dee?

TWEEDLEDEE	Contrawise, I'm Dum.

PIPER		Of course you are. I'll get it next time.

TWEEDLEDUM	She killed him! Killed my bother!

ALICE		Where is she? How did this happen?

BLUEBEARD	It's not like you don't have a spare.

ALICE		Alice: Not another word!

TWEEDLEDUM	[sobbing throughout] He never hurt no one no how... [sobbing]

GOLDILOCKS	I know.  I know.

ALICE		We must find her. Before she causes any more damage...

PIPER		No, no, no, no. She must have cut the feed somehow.

GOLDILOCKS	Why wouldn't she just leave?

ALICE		Why indeed.

PIPER	There must be something she wants. You remember that little resurrection trick she did.

GOLDILOCKS	The morgue?

PIPER		Yeah, I'll go check it out. Good, go.

ALICE		Good.  Go. Would you like to sit this tumble out, love?

TWEEDLEDUM	Contrawise, mum.

ALICE	That's a good boy. Off to the armory with you, then. Look the doors and watch for witches. This one is in love with Death. If she's still lurking about I've no doubt she'll head there next looking for his scythe. Which reminds me, Collect Rumpelstiltskin and meet me upstairs.

CARABOSSE	Wake up, wake up, my love.

DEATH		Oh, it's you again. So this is Looking Glass.

CARABOSSE	Wait! My love. You need me!

DEATH		And?

CARABOSSE	Let me... make you whole.

DEATH		And how do you plan of doing that, witch?

CARABOSSE	Here. Here is everything you need for the ritual. I can perform it. Please?

DEATH		So this is where they have my scythe? Yeah. I can feel it.

CARABOSSE	Yes. Yes, it's here. But, I brought you a little gift. Not what do you seek... ...but who you seek. [snarl]

DEATH		You need to seek a mint.

ALICE	I hope you're pleased with yourself. Tweedledee was a kind and gentle boy and it's your selfish meddling which got him killed. A fact I'm very much aware of. Now... I know you know more than you're letting on. If I find you've kept anything from me that would have saved his life... I'll have your head.

CARABOSSE	Everything almost ready. Just send your Messengers and let me take care of the rest.

DEATH	Oh they're on their way, alright. Find my scythe! Kill everyone of them, and bring me 'stiltskin! First Messenger that bags me a monster gets to skip a circle of hell.

GOLDILOCKS	Goldie here. We're breached. Lock it down. I'm securing the prisoners. Stay sharp. We don't know how many their are.

RUMPEL	[muffled scream]

GOLDILOCKS	Oh no.

BLUEBEARD	You didn't think I'd leave without saying goodbye, did you? You remember my wives, don't you? The remember you.

GOLDILOCKS	[coughing / gagging throughout]

BLUEBEARD	Let's have a threesome.

GOLDILOCKS	[heavy breathing]

BLUEBEARD	Bad doggie.

ALICE	Apologies for leaving but we're in a spot of bother at present. Death has come and found us wanting, I'm afraid. As you can see, we're under attack and I'm a tad shorthanded. You're either with us or not. I'm hoping these insure the former. Picked them up in Wonderland, all though I fear I don't recall how. Quite explosive. My little insurance policy. It's time for you to prove your usefulness. Sorry I can't wait around for you to come to your senses on your own time. You see, sense is a rather useless sentiment with so much senselessness afoot. You work for me now. If you try to leave, I'll kill you. If you try to remove it, I'll kill you. As a matter a fact, if you do anything I don't like, I'll kill you. Blink twice if we have a deal. Splendid. Now, you have a visitor. I believe you've met  'Her Majesty,' Queen of Hearts? Your first task is to get her to wear this. Welcome to Looking Glass.

QUEEN 	Hel-lo?

RUMPEL	Gelda, baby!

QUEEN 	Rumpy!

RUMPEL	What are you doing here? How long has it been?

QUEEN 	Oh, don't pretend like you don't know!

ALICE		What's going on out there? 

PIPER	It's the Messengers, the place is crawling with them.It's going to be like herding mice getting rid of... Who is she?

ALICE		She's one of mine.

PIPER		So she's nuts?

ALICE		Apparently the two of them use to be an item if that tells you anything.

QUEEN 	Rumpy, you look terrible. Why am I not surprised to find you between yet another rock and a hard place? 

RUMPEL	How did you know I was here?

QUEEN 	[chuckles] Oh, I always like to know right where you are. I couldn't let anything happen to my little Rumpy. What have you gotten yourself into?

RUMPEL	Well, It's been a little rough since the last time I saw you.

QUEEN	Apparently, If you've thrown in with this lot. You know, that Alice is quite batty, don't you?

PIPER	So maybe we can take this reunion to the cell block? Considering we're a little exposed here?

ALICE	We're reasonably safe if she's near. She's unhinged, unpredictable, and unfortunately something of a secret weapon. If she's going to help, we'll need him to convince her. She can control them. Any man, really.

PIPER		[sigh]

ALICE		Any man but him.

RUMPEL	Oh, trust me... She's nuts! Completely insane. And she's got me by the balls, Gelda.

QUEEN 	Oh, does she?

RUMPEL	Oh, Yes. Right under her thumb.

QUEEN 	Well, we can't have that.

GOLDILOCKS	You could have escaped whenever you wanted to. Why didn't you?

WOLF		Leave.

GOLDILOCKS	When we found you, you were eating zoo animals for food. Is that because you didn't want to hurt people?

WOLF		All I do is hurt people.

GOLDILOCKS	Right now that's a talent we can use.

QUEEN 	Tell me, what is it that she wants from you?

RUMPEL	Oh she thinks I have something to do with Death and his Messengers.

QUEEN 	And do you?

RUMPEL	Of course not.  But she won't help me unless I help her stop them. If I'm going to get out of this, I need your help.

QUEEN 	Of course you do! And I can leave anytime I want, darling.

RUMPEL	But I can't. I need your help. Please, baby.

QUEEN		What do you need me to do?

RUMPEL	I need you to put this on.

QUEEN 	That's mine! Oh no! Goodbye, Rumpy! You're on your own! Call me if you make it out of this.

RUMPEL	Do I have to beg?

QUEEN 	Then beg!

RUMPEL	Gelda, my queen, my love...

QUEEN		Do you love me?

RUMPEL	What's not to love?  Yes! Yes, I love you!

QUEEN 	But you left me.

RUMPEL	Well, you did marry a king.

QUEEN 	King of the morons and the crazies. I hate crazy! I hate it! Rumpy, It was so boring without you. You were supposed to come visit. And I waited and I waited for you to get your hands on that mirror and you broke it.

RUMPEL	Oh, I'm sorry. That was an accident, really baby. I never really wanted to be here... with her. [scoffs] I'd rather much be here with you.

QUEEN		I'm waiting.

RUMPEL	[clears throat] Gelda, queen of hearts, queen of my heart. Please, show me kindness. Stay, baby. You know I could never be apart from you.

QUEEN	[chuckles] You're lucky I've always has a soft spot for you. Sometimes I wonder how much of that was real and of that was mind control.

RUMPEL	Oh, Gelda. You and I both know, I could never control you.

QUEEN 	Nor I you.

RUMPEL	Awe. So you agree to help?

QUEEN 	I do.

RUMPEL	[laughing] Splendid! It's official. You won't regret it baby….trust me, what I got planned…we'll be sitting pretty…

QUEEN		I better not… and you better not be lying… [giggling]

PIPER		You sure you want to strap bombs to these nut jobs?

ALICE		Let's not think too much about it, shall we?

PIPER		What now then?

ALICE		Now we let the monsters out.

PIPER		Oh yeah?

ALICE	Alright Beasties, time to earn your keep. We've some unwanted guests and I'd like the lot of you to help me shoo them away.

GOLDILOCKS	Oh no, what now?

ALICE	Gelda darling, meet Bluebeard.  He's a nasty one. He'll need a little of your 'convincing.' I'd like him in Goldilock's care. She's no stranger to brutes.

BLUEBEARD	Why would I help you?

QUEEN		Is this our naughty boy?

ALICE		I don't like it any more than you do. But I'm without options at present.

BLUEBEARD	What I would love to slaughter all of you. It'd be fun.

QUEEN	You'll help because I tell you too, silly.  [alluring echo voice] You'll be a good boy and do everything miss Goldilocks here tells you to.

GOLDILOCKS	Don't worry.

QUEEN		[alluring echoing voice] Won't you?

BLUEBEARD	[whispers] Yes.

QUEEN		[enchanting] Are you a good boy, now? [enchanting] Are you a good boy?

BLUEBEARD	A good boy.

QUEEN		Perfect.

PIPER	Alice, if she can mind control him like that, Any reason why we can't just put her on the PA and tell these guys to back off?

ALICE		Unfortunately, her charms only work in person.

PIPER		How do you do it anyway?

QUEEN		[scoffs] Some of us are natural leaders, darling.

ALICE		Goldilocks, dear. What about our Wolfie?

GOLDILOCKS	Can I trust you?

WOLF		No.

GOLDILOCKS	Then trust me. He'll be fine.

ALICE		That settles that, then. Rumpelstiltskin? Tell us what you know.

RUMPEL	Thought you'd never ask. Well... He calls himself Death. Total hack. He runs a shit show called 'The Underworld.'  You see he's just a hustler. He does something for you, you do something for him, he gets your soul for the underworld. Now, a while back he asked me to get a hold of something for him, the old magic mirror. He wanted to use it to come here and take over, so I broke it. And now he's just stuck there and can't get anything done anywhere else without acting through his cult . Death's messengers. Oooohhh, Scary! [laugh] But, they're just people who can be killed. Luckily, you're all excellent killers. If he's here, it's because he knows you have the Scythe. If they get it to that witch, she'll be able to perform a ritual that will summon Death here to this realm. And that my friends would be a real problem. Death and decay, spreading like a cancer, Hmm? Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

ALICE		And that's why we're going to stop him.

RUMPEL	Excuse me?

ALICE	And why you're all going to help. Attention Death's messengers, We're not afraid of you. We know what you're after and you'll never get your bony hands on it I'm afraid. You're about to find out what we've been keeping in our basement. This is your last warning.

PIPER		Yo, mice!...Oh Shit.

ALICE 		Leave my facility or you won't like what happens next. That is all.

PIPER		[laughing]

BLUEBEARD	Thank you.

PIPER		[laughing]
QUEEN		Finally, what's your plan to get this thing off?

RUMPEL	What do you mean?

QUEEN	What do you mean what do I mean?  Oh I can't imagine that you're here and you don't have a plan. You do have a plan, right?

RUMPEL	Yes. Well, I'm working on it.

PIPER		Ever wonder if keeping a basement full of monsters was a bad idea?

GOLDILOCKS	Constantly.

PIPER		You good here?  I'm off to my witch hunt.

GOLDILOCKS	I got these two. Bluebeard is having his fun. And the Wolf is, well he's working out some anger issues.

PIPER		At least it's not mice.

QUEEN 	Oh, Rumpy, I am very disappointed.

RUMPEL	No, no, no, no, no listen. Just divide our time and find ourselves in the armory.

QUEEN 	What for?

RUMPEL	The Magic Mirror.

QUEEN 	[scoffs]

RUMPEL	She's got some locked up with that big fat idiot. Enough for one last shot of the ol' magic. At least enough for her let me go.

QUEEN		Oh, but then, clearly you don't need me then.

RUMPEL	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Gelda, baby. Come on! It's your little Rump roast, please.

CARABOSSE	[laughter] [snarling throughout] Wake up.

DEATH		This? This is your plan? I'm running out of Messengers here, witch.

CARABOSSE	See how desperate she is? Desperate enough to let Rumpelstiltskin out of his hidey-hole.

DEATH		So they're working together? That's adorable.

RUMPEL	Listen, seriously. We just have to see this through, right? Play her game and make her think she's in charge.

QUEEN		If you believe that, you're even madder than she is.

RUMPEL	Gelda, wait!

QUEEN 	Drop it.

RUMPEL	[screams]

QUEEN 	What? Oh Rumpy. You do care!

RUMPEL	You like that, don't you baby?

DEATH		I want to talk to 'stiltskin.

CARABOSSE	Want to make that happen? Oh yes… Yes.

DEATH		Maybe you're not as useless as I thought, huh?

PIPER		What's up witch?

CARABOSSE	[growls]

DEATH		Owe you one, Piper.

GOLDILOCKS	Bluebeard.

BLUEBEARD	Down boy. Keep your paws off her, she belongs to me.

GOLDILOCKS	Shut up. No! Don't hurt him! Hey! Hey. Trust me, remember? It's okay. It's okay. There's still more of you, okay? We... I need you. Snap out of it. Better yet, use it. This isn't over.

WOLF		I'm sorry. Okay. I warned you. Be careful. I'll tear this whole place down.

RUMPEL	There's still a bunch of them upstairs.

TWEEDLEDUM	How'd we do?

GOLDILOCKS	Shut it!

TWEEDLEDUM	Yes, mum.

RUMPEL	Did you have an accident? How about a pooper scooper?

ALICE	Mustn't dally now. Taking too long, mustn't waste time. You're late, you're late, you're late. You've gone and mucked things up, Alice. You've figured out the players, but not the game. You know who loves games, don't you, Alice? Oh, god.  Goldilocks, if you could be so kind, it's just occurred to me that we're missing a guest. Bring me hatter.

GOLDILOCKS	Hatter.

HATTER	Cuppa? Aren't there usually four of you?

PIPER		All in all not bad. But I'd be surprised if that was the last of the Messengers.

ALICE	I imagined it wasn't. You're back to witch duty. Apologies, love, seems it's going to be a long night. Off you pop.

TWEEDLEDUM	Yes, mum.

ALICE		Hatter.

QUEEN	Alice?! Well we all had a good, bloody time on your behalf and you should be pleased. So, what do you say we take these off, yes?

ALICE		Absolutely not.

QUEEN 	Rumpy! You said if I played along that she'd take these away.

RUMPEL	Gelda, baby it's just so Alice here feels a little safe.

QUEEN	Do you feel safe? I doubt very much she'd blows me up with all of us standing here!

ALICE		Don't be so certain.

QUEEN		I'm getting bored of this game! Pretty soon I won't want to play anymore.

RUMPEL	You're killing me here. Imagine going home to that every night.

ALICE		Hatter... I need you to take a little trip for me, love.

HATTER	[slurring] Oh, what fun. Where are we going?

ALICE		Well, The Underworld, I'm afraid.

HATTER	Oh well then, That'll take a nip of the good stuff.

ALICE		I thought you might say that. No better 'trip' outside of Wonderland.

GOLDILOCKS	Are you really doing this, Alice?

ALICE	Oh, don't worry about Hatter, dear. This'll be mild compared to what he got up to in Wonderland.

GOLDILOCKS	If you say so.

PIPER		What's wrong? 

GOLDILOCKS	Are you serious?  I can't believe she's doing this.

PIPER		Desperate times, Goldie.

GOLDILOCKS	Alice took us in and for a while everything felt just right. Lately I'm wondering if we made a mistake in trusting her.

PIPER		Classic Goldilocks.

GOLDILOCKS	I'm serious, Piper.

PIPER		I know!

GOLDILOCKS	Well then act like it.

PIPER	I am. Look. I'm going to go back to my witch hunt and I'm going to go check on Tweedle...dum?

GOLDILOCKS	His brother is dead, Piper. It's not funny anymore.

PIPER		We'll get through this, Goldie.

GOLDILOCKS	Okay?

ALICE		Remember Hatter, The underworld. I need to know what Death is planning.

HATTER	Hatter: Yes, yes, yes. 

ALICE		Do you think you can do that for me?

HATTER	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I always fancy a tumble down the 'ole rabbit hole, dear.

ALICE		Alright then, sit back.

HATTER	Oh yes... Bad vibes here, dear Alice. Taste like... Mutiny. Murder. Malice. Have I made a rhyme? I feel like to pop.  [sniffs] Hatter: Good stuff.

ALICE		He'll be like this for some time.

PIPER		Psst. Hey buddy. Seen any witches?

TWEEDLEDUM	Contrawise. If the witch was here, you won't need ask, nohow.

PIPER	Listen, I'm sorry about your brother. I know I wasn't the nicest to him, but you know-- It's okay. Head up high, big guy. Alright. Okay. Alright, buddy.

RUMPEL	How long is this gonna take?

HATTER	There's nasty business afoot this evening, Alice, my dear.

ALICE		Yes, Hatter. We know. What nasty business? What are they looking for?

HATTER	Best be quick like now.

ALICE		They nearly have everything they need. What do they need, Hatter?

HATTER	The prickly thing.

ALICE		The scythe.

HATTER	And the proper attire, of course.

ALICE		Attire? For what? Hatter, what attire?

HATTER	For the grand party, of course. But you won't like the guest list. Death is coming. And he has grand plans for you. Grand, grand, big funny plans.

ALICE		What does he mean? What does Death want with you?

RUMPEL	I want to stop him as much as you do.

ALICE	Where's Gelda? Goldilocks, be a dear and head outside to check the roof. Gelda, darling, don't make me blow you up, sweetheart. Gelda, come back.

RUMPEL	Gelda, come back.

ALICE 		Gelda, I'm not joking. Not one more step.

RUMPEL	No, no, no, let me talk to her. I can give her the Rumpy noodle. Come on.

PIPER		Alright, buddy. Okay. [laughs] Alright, big guy. That's good.

TWEEDLEDUM	You're... okay…

PIPER		Tweedledum!

QUEEN	[enchanting voice] That's far enough! Hmm.  [enchanting voice] Like me, now.  [enchanting voice] And off with your head! Ah, Ah, Ah.

PIPER		[heavy breaths throughout]

QUEEN		Oh, which one is that?

PIPER		That's Tweedledum.

QUEEN		Hmm. Drop it.  [enchanting voice] Drop it.  [enchanting voice] Open it.

PIPER		[grunts]

QUEEN		[enchanting voice] Take a hike, pipsqueak.

ALICE		Gelda, I will blow you up!

QUEEN		Well, go ahead then.

ALICE	She's in the armory. That's it. If we're lucky she'll take that scythe with her. No, no, no,no, no, please. Let me talk to her. Let me go and get her.

RUMPEL	You two are pals, right? You remember the magic mirror? The last time I broke something like that, it got us into this whole mess in the first place. But the Scythe is even more powerful. No one know what will happen if it goes off. Please. Alice, come on.

ALICE		Fine. Ten minutes or I will kill you both.

RUMPEL	Good, I can make it work.

ALICE		Why do you care?

RUMPEL	Because I love her.

ALICE		Of course.

CARABOSSE	Tonight is the night, my love.

DEATH		Only if you keep your promise, witch.

CARABOSSE	I will. I will.

DEATH		Oh yeah, then do it.

CARABOSSE	[sigh]

PIPER		Gotcha.

CARABOSSE	[screaming / struggling]

PIPER		Look what I found.

ALICE		Just the witch I wanted to see.

PIPER		Alice, Tweedledum...he...

CARABOSSE	Two down.

ALICE		Hatter. I could use a riddle about now.

HATTER	Alice you don't seem much of the riddling sport.

ALICE		[sobbing] Hatter, something's happened. We've lost another friend.

HATTER	Perhaps we ought to lose one more.

PIPER		Alice...

ALICE		Bring me one of the bodies.

PIPER		The messengers?

ALICE		Yes. Go.

PIPER		Okay.

ALICE	Wake him up. I want to talk to him. What makes you think he wants to talk to you? Because I want to offer him a deal.

DEATH	[snort] [clear throat] So... Is this the part where one of us says "So we finally meet at last?"

ALICE		We finally meet at last.

DEATH		What do you got for me?

ALICE	A consolation prize really. You see, we'll never let you have your little ceremony. Forget your interest in this realm... and I'll give you Rumpelstiltskin.

DEATH		Hmm, Stiltskin.

DEATH	Did I getcha? Anyway, I just had the most interesting conversation with the rabbit chaser. You got to hear about it. You... You. Ha. You cause me some trouble, bud.

RUMPEL	Look, buddy. Can you scroll me to the bottom here? Kind of on the clock here courtesy of Alice.

DEATH		You know she tried to trade you?

RUMPEL	She?

DEATH	Yeah, yeah, yeah. She offered you right up. To be fair, it should say, you know, her world for your worthless life. But there's no question there. There's no trust between you two. Ironically, she still has no idea that you are way more valuable to me than you are her.

RUMPEL	So what do you want, huh?

DEATH	Spit it out. What do I want, what do I want, what do I want. What I've always wanted... Before you broke the mirror.

RUMPEL	Hey, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.... Accident.

DEATH		Hey, there are set backs. It's cool, baby. I'm flexible. I got a backup plan. You.

RUMPEL	How is that?

DEATH	These bodies... they're... so fragile. They deteriorate so quickly but, not you. No, see, you've had real power, you just pissed it all away and now you're just scrambling to get it back. See in your body, in your body I'd be permanent. Whole.

RUMPEL	[chuckles]…look buddy… I'm not seeing the silver lining here, pal.

DEATH		You give me your body.

RUMPEL	I'd rather let Alice blow me up.

DEATH		And you get the underworld.

RUMPEL	Now we're talking.

PIPER	Al. We have the witch. The scythe. And Goldie will be back soon. There could be only so many messengers out there.

ALICE		Then tell me this, if we've won, why is she so tickled.

DEATH		Look. You've always wanted to be more than just a lap dog.

RUMPEL	Yeah.

DEATH		Real power.  A kingdom of your own. 

RUMPEL	Yeah.

DEATH	So be my lapdog. Trade me your body, I'll rule this realm and you can have my scraps. I'm sick of the underworld, man. It's time for me to move on, it's a good fit for you though. Considering, well, obviously.

RUMPEL	What if I say... No.

DEATH	Well, Alice will lock you up and I know just where to find you. And I will keep coming and coming and coming. The underworld has no shortage of souls, brother. Trust me on that. Nobody wants to die. Eventually she'll find out and she's just going to kill you. Then I'll just have to find another way. Just come on. Save me the headache.

RUMPEL	Alice will kill me anyway if I say yes. Lot'a good my body'll do you if she blows it up.

DEATH		So then we got to make it look real good then, don't we?

ALICE	Something funny is going on and I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. How puzzling. All these changes. I don't know who I am from one minute to the next. Running as fast as I can just to stay in one place. I'm afraid if I don't find out soon, I'll do something quite rash.

PIPER		Alice? Piper, be a dear and head upstairs for me? Where am I going?

ALICE		The armory, of course. I'll not gain a pawn only to sacrifice my queen.

PIPER		Okay.

ALICE	Rumpy, dear, I'm feeling quite tested. I hope you're not plotting. I mean it, now, your ten minutes is almost up. If you don't bring Gelda right back down here then I'm afraid you'll leave me no choice but to blow you both! Best not be late.

RUMPEL	Where is it?

QUEEN 	What took you so long?

RUMPEL	Where is it?

QUEEN 	Where were you? Excuse me? No 'thank you?'

RUMPEL	Thank you for what?

QUEEN 	Is this what you're looking for? Did I do good? I did, didn't I?

RUMPEL	You did great, baby.

QUEEN 	I want it like old times, Rumpy. When it was just you and me and everybody did what we said. And no Alice.

RUMPEL	I want it like that too, baby. But someone has to stop, Death.

QUEEN		Let her deal with it. Rumpy, let's run away together!

RUMPEL	Gelda, I can't run anymore. You don't understand.

QUEEN 	No. I don't think you understand.

RUMPELS	He'll never stop. Don't you know? Death always catches up to you. Now, I have a plan for both of us to get out of this, together. You just need to give me that vial and trust me. Gelda. Please. This is the one thing that can get me out of this.

QUEEN	Wrong. I'm the one that can get you out of this. Me! And, It's time you start acting like it.

RUMPEL	Gelda, stop! You're right. You're absolutely right, baby.

RUMPEL	I love you. Now let's just take that, and go to Alice and just give me--

QUEEN		[Interrupts] Where were you?

RUMPELS	What? What do you mean?

QUEEN		[laughs] You better tell me now?

RUMPEL	Okay, okay, okay. It was him. It was Death, alright? He offered me a deal I didn't like, so I didn't take it.

QUEEN		What deal?

RUMPEL	Gelda, please. A trick, a trick, alright? I give him my body, and he lets me take the underworld.

QUEEN 	Eww.

RUMPEL	Exactly, now come on.

QUEEN 	So you turned him down then? For me?

RUMPEL	Yes, of course.

QUEEN 	So that we can be together, forever.

RUMPEL	Yes.

QUEEN 	Promise me?

RUMPEL	Gelda... I promise. If this works out -- --

QUEEN		If?

RUMPEL	I promise. Will be together. Forever. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you. I'm sorry, Gelda. It had to look believable. [whispers] It was the only way.

GOLDILOCKS	it's a robe. That must be the 'attire' Hatter saw. Let's get out of there and do this quietly. Come on, Bluebeard.

QUEEN		Are you a good boy? A good boy? Good boy.

ALICE		Goldilocks dear, please do return soon as you can.

GOLDILOCKS	Sick'em. Where's Bluebeard?

BLUEBEARD	As much as I would love to tear her apart... Why don't you show me that wild side you been trying so hard to keep at bay.

GOLDILOCKS	Are you okay? Where's the robe?

WOLF		[growling / panting]

GOLDILOCKS	Come on. Where's the robe?

WOLF		[growl] Run!

GOLDILOCKS	Hey is just me remember? We have to get back inside and help!

WOLF		RUN!

ALICE		I'm afraid that's as far as I can trust you, Rumpelstiltskin.

PIPER		He's here! He's here! Please don't blow him up.

ALICE	Aren't you supposed to be the master plotter here? What's happening? What's their game?

RUMPEL	Alice, we really need to talk.  No.  You need to tell me what's going on or else I don't think I have a need for you anymore.

ALICE		As a matter of fact, I think I like you better back in your cell.

RUMPEL	Listen, if you want to stop for good then I have to tell you something, and you're really going to have to trust me.

ALICE		[scoffs] You must think me mad. All you've done is lie. Why should I trust you?

PIPER		Honestly, if this was your plan, no wonder Death dumped your ass.

BLUEBEARD	Good evening, Piper, I'll take that.

CARABOSSE	[screams / laughs]

BLUEBEARD	Aah!

ALICE		Piper!

CARABOSSE	[high pitch scream] Wait! That one, we need alive.

BLUEBEARD	You're not any fun. I believe this is what you need. I want in.

ALICE		Rumpelstiltskin? Rumpelstiltskin?

CARABOSSE	[unintelligible dialogue / chanting in foreign tongue]  [unintelligible dialogue / chanting in foreign tongue] [throughout scene]

ALICE		Chin up Piper, we'll figure something out.

DEATH	So this is where you've been hiding? [humming] You gotta admit, it's pretty funny how things work out sometimes, huh? You. I'm so sorry. You must be feeling so out of the loop right now.  [imitating english accent] Well let me catch you up to speed. See after our conversation, I had another little chat... with this guy.

ALICE		What does he mean?

DEATH	Oh! What do I mean, what do I mean, what do I mean, what do I mean is it's time for you to come through on your end of the deal. Man. You would do anything to wiggle yourself out of trouble. Am I right? Even killing the only woman who ever really loved you. You're real scum. I mean, gotta respect that. Boo boo? Come here, girl! Come here, girl! Come, girl! Come, girl... Stay! See, I forgot to mention... consider this a way to seal our deal. Call it my signature. Any objections? No? Well then let's start this ritual, huh? Come here.

GOLDILOCKS	Please, stop.

WOLF		I can't!

CARABOSSE	[chanting / snarling]

DEATH	Hey! Blue balls is here…err, Blue Beard is here. Keep your eye out for Goldie and her dog. Come on, Rumpy. Time for me and you to get real cozy. We don't hurt you. 

WOLF		You can't.

GOLDILOCKS	We good?

WOLF		I'm with you.

DEATH		What's taking so long?

CARABOSSE	The sacrifice must be perfect, my love. The circle must not be broken.

DEATH		Oh my god! Whatever, just hurry up. Really?

GOLDILOCKS	You take neckbeard, I'll take the others.

BLUEBEARD	Ha ha! I'm disappointed, Wolfie. Let me show you how it's done!

ALICE		Goldilocks, hurry!

PIPER		Goldie!

GOLDILOCKS	I'm coming.

DEATH		Oh, no you don't!

GOLDILOCKS	Alright, Death. Give me something to hit.

ALICE		Oh come on now, open damnit!

CARABOSSE	[roar]

PIPER		He's lying! He doesn't care about you.
 
CARABOSSE	Liar!

DEATH		Witch, let's go!

CARABOSSE	He loves me.

GOLDILOCKS	Get him, Hatter! Is something wrong, sweetheart?

PIPER		He's using you.

CARABOSSE	Lie!

PIPER		What do you think is gonna happen when this is over, huh?

CARABOSSE	Death will enter, Rumpelstiltskin for me. And then, we will be together forever.

PIPER		You obviously have no idea what's gonna happen.

CARABOSSE	[hisses]

DEATH		No more talkie, time for killing!

CARABOSSE	[growl]

ALICE	There you have it, now crack on. I've had enough of you! Are you quite happy?

GOLDILOCKS	You can't win.

DEATH		Oh, you bitch.

GOLDILOCKS	You should have possessed a better brawler.

DEATH		God punch.  You get a free bowl of porridge with that?

BLUEBEARD	Come here, boy. Cage match, then.

GOLDILOCKS	[grunt]

DEATH		Death: Now you're really gonna get it you blonde bi- 

CARABOSSE	[snarl / hiss]

BLUEBEARD	Goldie.

BLUEBEARD	It's time.

WOLF		[heavy breathing]

PIPER		Kill Rumpelstiltskin!

CARABOSSE	[screeching]

GOLDILOCKS	Piper!

CARABOSSE	[screeching]

GOLDILOCKS	You're okay. You're alright. Please be okay.

BLUEBEARD	She's a bit much for you, little girl.

GOLDILOCKS	It's just right.

BLUEBEARD	[grunt]…Goldie…[dies]

ALICE		Do you want to stop him? I'm trusting you Rumplestiltskin.

GOLDILOCKS	No.

ALICE		Tell me.  How do we stop this now?

GOLDILOCKS	Alice, No!

ALICE		Don't make me look at this.

RUMPEL	[indecipherable whispering]

GOLDILOCKS	Alice, What are you doing? Kill him!

RUMPEL	Blink twice if we have a deal.

CARABOSSE	Rumpelstiltskin! Hurry, this body won't hold.

GOLDILOCKS	Alice, kill him!

CARABOSSE	I underestimated you.

RUMPEL	Everyone does.

GOLDILOCKS	You sold us out, you son of a bitch!

RUMPEL	I get the underworld, and you get my body as soon as we shake.

GOLDILOCKS	Don't let them touch!

RUMPEL	Deal?

CARABOSSE	Deal.

GOLDILOCKS	What happened? What did you do?

ALICE	What he told me to. He said to blow up the wristband when they shook hands. And I'd be rid of them both.

GOLDILOCKS	Not like him to scrifice for the greater good.

ALICE		No, no it's not.

PIPER		[gasp]

GOLDILOCKS	Piper!

PIPER		Did we win?

GOLDILOCKS	Piper… How are you alive?

HATTER	Ow.

GOLDILOCKS	I wonder what Rumpelstiltskin got out of the deal?

RUMPEL	Ah. Truce!

ALICE		Rumpelstiltskin, I presume. So that was your scheme?

RUMPEL	Aww, look at them. So happy. So alive! Thanks to me, of course. See, things are under 'new management' downstairs. It's not as sinister as you assumed, Alice. I gave a few souls back. Maybe you can make something out of them. Your own little sinister squad.

ALICE		You want to make a deal?

RUMPEL	I already got everything I needed... from you. Consider this a freebie. A peace offering. Don't forget, I know you tried to sell me out. Oh, Alice. You're cleverer than that. Hopefully after this we can trust each other a little more. I tell you what, I can make you a deal. A real no brainer. You keep an eye on everything up there. And I'll keep an eye on things, down here.

ALICE		Better the devil you know, then?

RUMPEL	Something like that. Too-do-loo wonder bread. Ha, ha.
