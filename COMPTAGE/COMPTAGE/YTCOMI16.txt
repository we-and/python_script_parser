STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...	

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!	

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends, Really Useful 	around the World!

STORYTELLER	Thomas goes to Spain.	

STORYTELLER	Thomas was travelling through Spain with his new friend Nuria. They were pulling some empty trucks
STORYTELLER	“Where are going?” he wanted to know.

STORYTELLER	“To a small town called Buñol! There is going to be a big celebration!”

STORYTELLER	“And we are collecting the most important thing for the festival!”

STORYTELLER	Thomas wondered what cargo they might be picking up.  

STORYTELLER	“It must be something very large,” Thomas thought. “Or very, very important!”

STORYTELLER	So he was surprised when all they collected were boxes and boxes and crates and crates and crates of –

THOMAS	“Tomatoes?!” said Thomas.
	
STORYTELLER	“They must be very hungry in this little town of Buñol to need so many vegetables!”

STORYTELLER	Nuria laughed “tomatoes aren’t vegetables Thomas, they’re fruit... and today is the day of La Tomatina – the tomato festival!”

STORYTELLER	As the sun burned away the morning clouds, Thomas wondered about all those tomatoes.

STORYTELLER	He’d seen Spanish people eating tomatoes in many different ways.

STORYTELLER	Tomato salad. Tomatoes stuffed with rice. Even a cold tomato soup called gazpacho.

STORYTELLER	“Is that what the tomatoes are for?” asked Thomas. “A giant bowl of gazpacho?”

STORYTELLER	“No, Thomas!” said Nuria. “Just wait and see! It will be a surprise!”

STORYTELLER	When Thomas arrived at Buñol, “La Tomatina” was about to begin!

STORYTELLER	“Muchas Gracias, Thomás!” said a man as he carried away a crate of tomatoes.

STORYTELLER	Just then, an important-looking man stood up and said, “Que la fiesta comience!”

STORYTELLER	And that’s when the tomatoes started flying!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was surprised! La Tomatina was a big tomato fight – for fun!
