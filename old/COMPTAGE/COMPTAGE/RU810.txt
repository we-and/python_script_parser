RUPAUL	Welcome back to the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race."  Now, our top three queens have snatched your attention all season long, and tonight I've challenged each of them to slay the stage one last time.  Purse first, a New York City girl who puts the taint in entertaintment, give it up for a demure little lady we call Bob The Drag Queen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) I don't go out looking for the spotlight.  The spotlight finds me.  (deep voice) Uh, over here.  Try to tone it down, tuck it in real tight.  But it's not that easy.  It's not that easy.  Since I was a child, people keep saying, I've been doing too much.

ALL	(lip-sync) Doing too much.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) Mama always said, "Hold your head up high.  You've got that magic touch"

BACKUP SINGERS	The magic touch.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) So whether it's acting, comedy, body, singing, dancing, or serving chocolate chip cookies.  I don't like to show off.

BACKUP SINGERS	Don't show off.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) I don't like to show off.

BACKUP SINGERS	Don't show off.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) I keep it subtle, keep it humble 'cause it's not my gig.  I like to keep my talents tucked under my wig, whoo.

BACKUP SINGERS	Whoo.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) I don't like to show off.

BACKUP SINGERS	Don't show off.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) Read my lips.  All the other bitches call me ratchet.  You're way too big I snatch it.  Go ahead and hand me the Oscar.  I'm the only one on the roster.  If you come for B-O-B, you must be an SOB.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) Never was a hater, but I'm making mashed potater out of err'body right in front of you.  Ha, ha, ha.  I don't like to show off.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) I don't like to show off.  I keep it subtle, keep it humble, 'cause it's not my gig.  I like to keep my talents tucked under my wig.  Whoo.  I don't like to show off.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(lip-syncs) Off.

ALL	Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!  Bob!

RUPAUL	Wow.  (laughs) Work it out for team humble.

RUPAUL	Now, while you catch your breath, let's talk to the judges.  Michelle Visage, what'd you think?

MICHELLE	That was amazing.
	
MICHELLE	Come on, choreography.

ROSS	Phenomenal.  I'm so proud of you.  And I love that you play safe.  Every one of your dancers was wearing a hard hat.  I love that.
	
ROSS	It's important.

CARSON	I think you need to change your name to Bob The Superstar.

RUPAUL	Ooh.  Well, thank you, judges.  Now, Bob The Drag Queen, from the moment you entered the workroom you had uniqueness, nerve, and talent written all over you.  Let's take a look.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	My name is Bob The Drag Queen.  I'm hilarious, beautiful, talented, and humble.

RUPAUL	That's the biggest pearl necklace I've ever seen.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(as Uzo Aduba) How you doing, RuPaul?

RUPAUL	(laughs)

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	(as Carol Channing) I'm sorry that I'm late, but "Uzo Abubu" left the stage.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, then why did I waste my time putting on this?  Oh, there's more.  This.

MICHELLE	Sometimes you borderline on showboating.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Insert shady rattlesnake noise here.  (rolls tongue)

RUPAUL	Bob, how's your head?


BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No complaints.  I'm Bob The Drag Queen, a queen for the people.

RUPAUL	Now, Bob, when did you first become aware of drag?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I used to watch "To Wong Foo."

MAN	Yas!

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I saw, like, this, like, glamazonian, like, goddess coming down from the ceiling wearing a big confederate flag.  I was like, "Oh, this bitch is--" when I say bitch, I mean it, like, the way you'd call your grandmother a bitch.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I was like, "This bitch is pushing buttons, girl," and I loved it.

RUPAUL	You excelled at so many of the challenges.  Did you study the show before you came on?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	No, I'm just really talented.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You know, listen, this is my favorite show.  This is what I thought I was supposed to be doing my whole life.  When I was performing in, like, bars in New York City, dodging beer bottles literally…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	…I was like, "This doesn't feel right.  There's something bigger coming."  Lo and behold, I found something bigger.  Her name is RuPaul, and she blessed me.

RUPAUL	Now, Bob, at one point in the season the other queens were rooting for you to fail.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Mm-hmm.

RUPAUL	What did that feel like?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	It felt like I was doing it right.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I mean, no one's rooting for the person doing the worst.  No one's like, "Oh, you're doing bad.  You should get out."  They're like, "Ooh, she's doing so well.  Get her the (bleep) out of here."

RUPAUL	All right, so we've got some fan questions over there.

SHANGELA	Hallelu, I'm back, RuPaul!

SHANGELA	Tucker from Florida wants to know, "Does your humor come from overcoming a dark place in your life?"

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Um, see, I mean, I have the struggles that a lot of y'all homosexuals here had, especially…

RUPAUL	What?  They're--wait, wait--they're--this…

RUPAUL	These are homosexuals?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	A few.  I had the same hardships that everyone else here has, and we all deal with it in different ways.  If you find something to filter your pain and your anger into, it'll flourish.  It really will.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Shangela.  Now, Bob, you blew everyone away with your Snatch Game impersonations.  Now, did you ever hear from Uzo or Carol Channing?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Well, Uzo tweeted at me and was like, "This was amazing," and I was like, "Thank you," and I am obsessed with Carol Channing, but she's just--she's .  It's hard to get out of the house when you're .

RUPAUL	Yeah, sure.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	I'm , and it's hard for me to get out, so.

RUPAUL	Yeah, I know, I know.  Well, we did hear from the one and only Carol Channing.  Take a look.

CAROL	Thank you, Bob, for your colorful impersonation of me.  I'm so honored to be a part of your history.  Oh, I'm proud of that.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh, my God.

RUPAUL	Yes.  So Bob, I know your brother's over there, right?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yeah, he's the one who's just a shade darker than me.  I'm :.  He's midnight.

RUPAUL	Justin, what was it like growing up with Bob?

JUSTIN	Bob used to cry on my birthdays 'cause it wasn't about him.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	That's true.  That's true.

RUPAUL	Now, Bob, I know that your mother couldn't be here because of her health.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yes.

RUPAUL	Darn, you know, it would have been a great opportunity for us to have a taped message or something, but we didn't--we don't have--wait a minute.  Oh, actually, we do have a taped message.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Oh.

RUPAUL	Let's roll that.

JUSTIN	Hey.

BOB'S MOM	Bob, this is your mother.  I'm very proud of you.  I've always believed in you, even when you didn't believe in yourself.  Continue to work hard on your craft.  Always respect your fans.  Reach for the stars, Chris, do the best you can.  Like I always tell you and your brother, keep the first thing the first thing, and I love you.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	You got me.  You got me.  Oh, my goodness.

RUPAUL	Now, Bob, what would it mean to you to win $,?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	$, isn't the thing because money comes and goes, but winning this title, that means something.  You get to go forth and carry a legacy and do something and make a change in somebody's life and put first things first and do something.

RUPAUL	Right, well--right, well…

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Now, I've watched all  episodes of "RuPaul's Drag Race," and I've noticed you have never once walked into the room purse first.

RUPAUL	Oh, my God, look at this.  Oh, and it matches my outfit.  It's perfect.  I love it.  Purse first.  I love it.  Give it up for Bob The Drag Queen.

SINGER	Cha cha, bitch.

MICHELLE	Are you team Bob?  Tweet us now with #dragrace.  Next, we're gonna Kim Chi that walk and go big with Naomi Smalls as the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race" continues.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome back to the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race."  Up next we've got an Instagram superstar who's about to lisp sync for her life.  Now serving Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	(lip-syncs) I came here to debut.  A brand-new dance for you.  Really easy to do.  It's the new sensation.  Only three things you need to do it just like me.  Count it like one, two, three, every generation.  Beyoncé.  Madonna.  Got nothing on this triple threat.  Do the…

BACKUP SINGER	Fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.

KIM CHI	(lip-syncs) Yeah…

KIM CHI & BACKUP SINGER	(lip-sync) Fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.

KIM CHI	(lip-syncs in foreign language) one, two, three.  (lip-syncs in foreign language) Britney.  Rihanna.  Got nothing on this triple threat.

KIM CHI & BACKUP SINGER	(lip-sync) Do the fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.

KIM CHI	lip-syncs) Uh-huh.

KIM CHI & BACKUP SINGER	(lip-sync) Fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.  (lip-sync in foreign language) Fat, fem, and Asian, fat, fem, and Asian.  fat, fem, and Asian.  (lip-sync in foreign language) Fat, fem, and Asian, fat, fem, and Asian.  Fat, fem, and Asian.  (lip-sync in foreign language)

RUPAUL	Wow.  Kim Chi, I love that song.  It's got a good beat, and you can't dance to it.

RUPAUL	All right, Kim Chi, let's hear from the judges.  Michelle Visage, what's the tea on Kim Chi?

MICHELLE	I love that your purity and your beautiful energy took something that was normally considered negative and turned it into something fun and beautiful.

ROSS	Yes.

CARSON	Nailed it.


ROSS	Today Kim Chi is on the menu, and you are the main course.  Who's hungry?


RUPAUL	Now, Kim Chi, you came to this competition hungry.  You won the first challenge, and then you stayed hungry.  Let's take a look.


KIM CHI	My name is Kim Chi.  I came to chop suey the competition.  I'm known for crazy, over-the-top pure anime fantasy.

RUPAUL	Animazing.

KIM CHI	I may across shy because I am soft-spoken, but donut come for me because I'll destroy you.

MICHELLE	I do get concerned about your walk.  It's very stiff, darling.

KIM CHI	Exqueeze me?  My mom doesn't know that I do drag.

RUPAUL	What?  Kim Chi, you didn't just get better.  You got fierce.

KIM CHI	I don't want to be America's next drag superstar.  I am America's next drag superstar.

RUPAUL	Now, Kim Chi, you were so honest and vulnerable this season.  In fact, watching the show back, at one point you made me ugly cry, girl, so I hope you don't mind if I ask you some very personal questions.  First one, when was the last time you fell down?

KIM CHI	Actually, earlier today.  I'm not even joking.  I tripped on my skirt, and I fell over the craft service table.

RUPAUL	Now, everyone is gagging on your looks, just so many amazing looks.

RUPAUL	What inspires you?

KIM CHI	My inspiration comes from a lot of random places.  I could be walking down the street and see a rock and be like, "Oh, that rock is pretty.  Let me make a gown inspired by the rock."

KIM CHI	So there's no one set inspiration, but everyday life and nature.

RUPAUL	Now, is it true you gave the $, you won in the first challenge to your mother?  Why'd you do that?

KIM CHI	My mom works really hard to, you know, pay the bills, and she works as a server at a Korean restaurant currently, and I want to do everything that I can to help my mom financially.

RUPAUL	Yeah.  Have you told her that you do drag yet?

KIM CHI	I still have not, but, you know, it's like…

RUPAUL	She didn't watch the show?

KIM CHI	I mean, she's very Korean-American, and she's really, like, not open to American culture at all, so I don't think--yeah, I don't think she'll ever find out about "drag race."

RUPAUL	Well, listen, I am a firm believer in things happen when they're supposed to happen, so right after this, why don't we drive over to your mother's house and I tell her myself?

KIM CHI	Road trip?

RUPAUL	Road trip.

KIM CHI	Road trip.

RUPAUL	Yes.  Who's here supporting you tonight?

KIM CHI	I have my friend Ryan, Diana, Amy, and Trixie.

RUPAUL	So Diana, what do you think of Kim Chi's journey?

DIANA	I think Kim Chi is the most creative, talented, and hardworking person I know.  I'm so happy to be your friend, and I want the best for you.

RUPAUL	All right, now, we've got some fan questions for you, Kim Chi.  Oh, look, we have the Pit Crew coming d--and they--you forgot your pants, guys.

KIM CHI	(laughs)


PIT CREW	Kim Chi, Tiara from Facebook asks, "If you could lose your virginity to a member of the Pit Crew, who would it be?"

KIM CHI	Um, I'm not trying to catch anything, so I'm gonna say none of them, but…

RUPAUL	Shade.  Shade.  Shade!  (laughs) Oh, thank you, Pit Crew members.

RUPAUL	I don't know what to say after that.  All right, Kim Chi, well, we have one more question.  Well, actually, it's more of a statement.  Take a look.

MARGARET	(as Kim Jong-iL) Kim Chi, I am supreme leader, but you are supreme drag queen.  You better work, or else I put you in a labor camp.  Kim Chi, it's Margaret Cho.  I'm so proud of you.  You're so beautiful.  You are so funny, and I think you are a good dancer.

RUPAUL	So Kim Chi, what would it mean to you to become America's next drag superstar?

KIM CHI	It would obviously change my life.  I'd be able to not be broke.

KIM CHI	I'd be able to afford guacamole on my burrito bowl.  I'd be able to start my own makeup company, which I would love to do, and it would mean that anybody who's ever felt like they weren't part of anything, anybody that felt like they couldn't be anything, as long as you stay true to who you are, be creative, be original, and your dreams will eventually come true.

RUPAUL	Well, Kim Chi, read my lisp…

RUPAUL	…we love you.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	Are you team Kim Chi?  Then tweet all about it.  #dragrace.  Up next, Naomi Smalls is gonna stretch her legs when the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race" continues.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome back to the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race."  Now it's time for our final performance of the night.

MICHELLE	Honey, whatever's on the menu, I'm buying two.

ROSS	Look how far you've come, honey, and you have proven tonight that you have legs up on the competition.  Yes, you do.

CARSON	You came, you saw, you contoured, and you conquered.

ROSS	Yes.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Thank you, Naomi Smalls.  Now, as the youngest queen to compete this season, you've come a long way, baby.  Let's take a look.

NAOMI SMALLS	I am Naomi Smalls.  Check your lipstick before you come for me.  Naomi has legs all the way up to her (bleep).  Naomi is a fashion girl.

NAOMI SMALLS	She's (bleep) fierce.  (lip-syncs) Bitches better beware.

RUPAUL	Oh, all of that right there.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm giving you Naomi Campbell strutting down a Versace runway.

MARC	I just thought it was perfection.

ROSS	This is how you win this competition.

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs) I have eight brothers and three sisters.

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Whoa.

DAX EXCLAMATIONPOINT	That is crazy.

NAOMI SMALLS	This is my mom.  She's, like, the best mom ever.

RUPAUL	Do you have a message you want to say to your mother?

NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you for everything you've ever done, and I hope I can repay you for the rest of my life.

NAOMI SMALLS	I'm Naomi Smalls, and I promise to represent you fiercely.

RUPAUL	Naomi, you have the fever and the flavor for fashion.  Now, where does that come from?

NAOMI SMALLS	I honestly don't know because I grew up in, like, a family that was--sorry, guys, not the most fashion-forward or anything like that, but I just remember, like, looking at magazines when I was a kid and just being so obsessed with them, and I wanted to look like these amazing supermodels that were in the glossy pages.

RUPAUL	Sure, yeah.  Now, halfway through the competition you seemed to come to life.  What happened?

NAOMI SMALLS	I was so scared in the beginning of standing out and--like, for the wrong reasons, but when it comes to Snatch Game, you can't hide anywhere, and being in the bottom two and having to lip sync for my life just put that fire underneath my ass to take chances and stand out for all the right reasons.

RUPAUL	Yeah, you did really well.


NAOMI SMALLS	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Now, Naomi, we have a taped message from one fierce queen.  Let's take a look.

LENA	Hi, Naomi.  Now, in Westeros there's only room for one queen, but in Ru's queendom, girl, I can't wait to see you take that crown.  Now…Cersei that walk.

RUPAUL	I love that.

NAOMI SMALLS	So good.

RUPAUL	Now, we have some fan questions.  G-G-G-Gia?

GIA GUNN	Herminio from Mexico…

NAOMI SMALLS	Hi, Herminio.

GIA GUNN	Would like to know how did it feel when Naomi Campbell checked you online?

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs) It was, like, the biggest moment of my life.

RUPAUL	What did she say?

NAOMI SMALLS	Well, she followed me on Instagram, and then she had, like, this interview saying, "I really am loving that Naomi Smalls," and I, like…

RUPAUL	I love that.  Tell me this.  What would it mean to you to become America's next drag superstar?

NAOMI SMALLS	It would mean the world to me to be America's next drag superstar.  Just to get that stamp of approval from you and carry on your legacy would be…

WOMAN	Yeah, supermodel, work!

NAOMI SMALLS	(laughs) The biggest goal I ever met in my life.

RUPAUL	I love it.  Now, before we go, I want to say hello to your mother.  Where is she?

NAOMI SMALLS	She's right there.

RUPAUL	Would you--where--oh, there she is.  Hi.  So June, what was it like raising a leggy supermodel?

NAOMI'S MOTHER	Well, I'm a little shocked that he didn't get fashion tips from me.  I had no idea.  He has always been mazing.

RUPAUL	Really?

NAOMI'S MOTHER	Yes.

RUPAUL	Did you buy the fashion magazines, or did…

NAOMI'S MOTHER	No, but I did start buying the wigs and the shoes and the…

RUPAUL	Now, besides Naomi, how many kids did you raise?

NAOMI'S MOTHER	 altogether.

RUPAUL	Wow.  Wow.  Naomi, where are your other brothers and sisters tonight?

NAOMI SMALLS	Well, they're all over the world.  They're actually all over this theater too.

RUPAUL	Well, let's bring them out, the Von Trapp family singers.

RUPAUL	Come on out.  Where are they?

NAOMI SMALLS	Oh!  Oh!  How are you?

NAOMI'S BROTHER	Hi, sweetie.

NAOMI SMALLS	How are you?  How are you?  Ahh!

RUPAUL	You know, like I always say, the family that drags together slays together.

RUPAUL	Let's hear it for the legendary, all legs, no dairy, Naomi Smalls.

SINGER	Cover girl, put the bass in your walk.
MICHELLE	Are you team Naomi?  Then let the world know.  Tweet it with #dragrace.  Coming up, the queens reunite, we announce Miss Congeniality, and more when the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race" continues.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome back to the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race."  Now, we're just moments away from crowning America's next drag superstar, but first it's time to bring back my girls.

RUPAUL	Starting with a nerdy bird, a glam rock rebel, and one cuckoo queen.

DAX EXCLAMATIONPOINTMy name is Dax ExclamationPoint.  What's up, nerds?  My look is very inspired by, like, science fiction and comics, strong, bad bitches who don't take any crap from anybody else.

RUPAUL	Show me your exclamation point.

DAX EXCLAMATIONPOINT	Yeah!

LAILA MCQUEEN	All right, ladies, let's turn up the juice and see what shakes loose.  Laila is, like, a whory quasi--I don't want to say gothy, but, like, gothy.  My biggest concern is that I'm gonna fade into the background.  I'm here too.

RUPAUL	Dax ExclamationPoint, Laila McQueen, neither one of you survived that lip sync.  Sashay away.

LAILA MCQUEEN	Both of us?  Really?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINEHow you doing, mis amores?  My name is Cynthia Lee Fontaine.  Do you want to see my cuckoo?  Cuckoo.  Cuckoo.  I need a space for this junk in the trunk.  I'm sexy as a goddess is.  I'm funny as a clown.  I am sickening.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Did my teeth look yellow?  No.

RUPAUL	Dax ExclamationPoint and Laila McQueen, welcome back.

LAILA MCQUEEN	Hello.

DAX EXCLAMATIONPOINT	Hey, Ru.

RUPAUL	So Dax, I hear that the song "I Will Survive" is haunting you everywhere you go.  Is that true?

DAX EXCLAMATIONPOINT	Yes, like, literally everywhere I go, like, it could be a gas station, grocery store, anywhere, it just happens to come on.

RUPAUL	Listen, if I were you two, I would seize the moment.  I would record another song.  I would s--call it "I didn't survive."

RUPAUL	You know?  It'd be a huge hit.  But seriously, there are no losers on "drag race."  Dax, what's life been like since you were on the show?

DAX EXCLAMATIONPOINT	Honestly, life has been absolutely amazing.  Like, the fans have been phenomenal.  I mean, obviously, like, I don't have as many fans as, like, you know, Kim Chi or Bob or Naomi.  That's fine.  It's fine, but the ones I do have are phenomenal.

RUPAUL	Now, I've got a confession to make.  Laila McQueen and I have a secret past.  I deny it, but there's proof.  Take a look.

LAILA MCQUEEN	(groans)

RUPAUL	That little pixie to the right of me is Laila McQueen when I was not running for president in Manchester, New Hampshire.

LAILA MCQUEEN	You know, my grandmother calls you Ron Paul.

RUPAUL	(laughs) Now, did you ever imagine at that point that you would be on this stage?

LAILA MCQUEEN	Oh, absolutely not.  I mean, I was performing in, like, function halls and Mexican restaurants.  Like, I never imagined being here or anywhere else around the world.

RUPAUL	So now, what's happened to you because of "drag race"?

LAILA MCQUEEN	I get to go everywhere and meet the people that love the work I do and embrace so much love that I never thought I would see.

RUPAUL	All that at the truck stop?

RUPAUL	So Dax, Laila, you aren't just surviving.  You are thriving.



RUPAUL	Thank you.  Next up, straight from Santee Alley, Cynthia Lee Fontaine.  Now, since the show, you've been through it, haven't you, girl?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Yes, actually the episode that I been eliminated, I was experience symptoms.  I'm a liver cancer survivor, stage .  I'm here to celebrate that.

RUPAUL	Wow.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Yes.

RUPAUL	And how do you feel right now?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	I'm in the discharge process already right now, so I feel amazing.  I feel fantastic.

RUPAUL	Good.  Yeah.  Did any of your drag sisters reach out to you?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Yes, one special person, and it's Acid Betty.

RUPAUL	That Acid Betty?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	That Acid Betty.  Yeah, Acid Betty.  She came to visit me as soon as she knew that I was diagnosed.  She was taking care of me.  She was like, "Bitch, you're not alone.  I got your back."  I think the positive attitude from all my entire new sisterhood helped me to recovery and helped me to be more positive every day.

RUPAUL	Wow.  I love it.  Well, Cynthia Lee Fontaine, we are cuckoo for your cuckoo.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

RUPAUL	Now a queen who always picks up when I call and a badass in total control of herself.  Let's take a look.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	The beauty is here.  My name is Naysha Lopez.  I spend money.  I don't do drag on a dime.

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez, sashay away.  How soon can you get here?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Bitches, I'm back!

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Face, body, glamour.

RUPAUL	Your ass is real?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yes.  Realness, boo.

ACID BETTY	This acid trip is all real.  My drag style is completely over the top, punk unicorn realness.  The main bullet point of Acid Betty is she's a bitch.  I'm not gonna be unprepared because of you, boo.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty, you've taken us on one wild trip.  Now, Naysha Lopez, Michelle and I have a running bet, okay?  That ass of yours, is it real?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	So listen, Ru, I…	

NAYSHA LOPEZ	I eat well.  I work out.  I have  ccs of medical grade silicon.  I--no.

RUPAUL	So on the show you said your ass was real.

NAYSHA LOPEZ		My ass is real.  However, have I had some enhancements to the body-ody-ody?

RUPAUL	Yeah.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yes, I have.

RUPAUL	Ah.

MICHELLE	(laughing)

RUPAUL	Now, you missed the Madonna runway storyline.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yes.

RUPAUL	What would you have worn?

NAYSHA LOPEZ	I'm a very creative person, and what I had going on was another kimono.

RUPAUL	What?  What is it with these queens and kimonos?  Naysha, thanks for gracing us with your gorgeous beauty and that booty twice.

NAYSHA LOPEZ	Yes.

RUPAUL	Next, Acid Betty.  Now, are you really here, or am I having a flashback?  Now, you turned out some killer looks this season.

ACID BETTY	Thank you.

RUPAUL	How have fans been to you?

ACID BETTY	I love the fans.  They are the best, the best.  The best thing of this show are the fans.  The love is so intense, and it's wonderful.  I actually had a kid that I met at DragCon, and they decided that they were gonna go into fashion and got a full scholarship to FIDM because of seeing me on the TV show.

RUPAUL	Wow.  Wow.

ACID BETTY	That's really great.

RUPAUL	Now, Acid Betty, you took a lot of heat for your Nancy Grace impersonation, but some people really, really liked it.  Take a look.

NANCY	Acid Betty, I loved watching you be me, but frankly, speaking professionally, you got a raw deal.  You were robbed.  No tea, no shade, but unleash the lawyers.  We got a case here.

ACID BETTY	That's fierce.

RUPAUL	I love it.  Aci, I could go on talking to you all night, but I refuse to say anything further until I lawyer up.

RUPAUL	Ladies and gentlemen, Acid Betty.

MICHELLE	Coming up, get into the groove when Robbie, Thorgy, Derrick, and Chi Chi return, and find out who snatches Miss Congeniality.  Plus, are you team Bob, team Kim Chi, or team Naomi?  I can't hear you.  Tweet us with #dragrace as the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race" continues.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome back to the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race."  Now, the best way to describe our next three queens is brassy, Brooklyn, and Britney, bitch.

ROBBIE TURNER	Good morning.  My name is Robbie Turner, and I'm the kindest queen you'll ever meet.  (sings) I want you to be hot and saucy.

ESTER	Yes, Marilyn.

RUPAUL	She's in a league of her own.

MICHELLE	I would wear the hell out of that jumpsuit.

RUPAUL	Oh!

TASHA	Oh!


ROBBIE TURNER	Too real?

THORGY THOR	Whoo!  Thorgy with a T-H and orgy, and I feel incredible.  I'm colorful.  I'm fun, and I'm a fashion clown.  (laughs)

KIM CHI	(gasps)

THORGY THOR	This is harder on me than it is for you guys.  No, it's not.  I can be campy, but also I can be, like, (bleep) fierce.  Whoo!

MICHELLE	I'm so proud of you.  Great job.

THORGY THOR	Yes!

DERRICK BARRY	It'd Derrick, bitch.  I may look angelic, but I am not that innocent.  I also have a career with my wigs on.  You'll have a career once you start gluing yours down.

MICHELLE	You have to give us more.  That is not a Britney reference.

DERRICK BARRY	Oh!

RUPAUL	Oh!


CARSON	That's how you go out in style, girls.

RUPAUL	Now, Robbie Turner, how does someone so young know so much about classic Hollywood?

ROBBIE TURNER	My mother and father wouldn't allow us to watch contemporary films, so we watched classic Hollywood films all the time, so I thought they were contemporary.

ROBBIE TURNER	So you can imagine little baby Robbie when she's like, "Judy Garland died many moons ago," and it's like, "What?"

RUPAUL	Now, what was your favorite moment on the show?

ROBBIE TURNER	On my birthday I won the singing challenge with the le chicken wings,

ROBBIE TURNER	…and came back and said happy birthday to me.  I'm like, um, I don't see the problem with this birthday at all--"Drag Race," Debbie, chicken wings.

RUPAUL	Robbie, thank you so much for all the classic sass.  Oh, and by the way, I will be sending you a bill for that broken light bulb that you did.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.  Up next, hey, there, Thorgy girl.

THORGY THOR	Hey, Ru.

THORGY THOR	Yeah!

RUPAUL	Now, like Michelle and I, you and Bob have a very complicated relationship.  Tell me about it.

THORGY THOR	I love to argue and fight about everything.  I love it.  There's always a way to tear things apart and make them better.  Bob can take it from me.  He'll just listen to me talk and go, "I still don't like you."

THORGY THOR	But when people see me and Bob doing that, they're like, "Oh, you guys really don't like each other."  I'm like, "I just love fighting with him so much," but I'm just in love with Bob very much.

RUPAUL	Now, you have dreams of starting a thorchestra?  Is that right?

THORGY THOR	Yeah.

RUPAUL	What is a--what's a thorchestra?

THORGY THOR	Well, ever since I was playing violin and then I got into, like, the art of drag, I wanted to conduct, like, a -piece orchestra.  I wanted to travel the world.  I want, like, Rufus Wainwright to wheel out on a piano and be like, "Oh, my friend Rufus is here to sing a song."

RUPAUL	That's a great idea.  Will you play a little something for us right now?

THORGY THOR	Sure.  Oh, my God!

THORGY THOR	Thank you, guys.

RUPAUL	Well, Thorgy, I cannot wait to see what you're gonna do next.

THORGY THOR	Whoo!

RUPAUL	Up next, the th queen to prance into my workroom--(sings) Hey, Derrick.

DERRICK BARRY	Whoo!

RUPAUL	Now, you struggled to get out of the Britney box, as it was called.

DERRICK BARRY	Yes.

RUPAUL	What's your relationship with Britney now?

DERRICK BARRY	I will always do Britney.  I'm not leaving that behind.

DERRICK BARRY	Of course I wanted to come on the show to expand what I already do and take it to the next level, and I feel like not only can I do Britney now, I can do drag.  I'm doing drag right now.

RUPAUL	Now, Derrick, throughout the season you were not afraid to speak your mind loudly, especially with Bob and Naomi.  You have any regrets about that?

DERRICK BARRY	Everything?  Oh, gosh, it's hard because I watch it back, I'm like, "Oh, wow, I shouldn't have said that.  Probably shouldn't have had that drink and untucked."

DERRICK BARRY	And yes, I have a hard time taking criticism because I've never been criticized like that before.  Doing Britney was what I've always done, and I was praised for that, and now coming into this competition it was almost looked down upon that that was something that I was known to do.  And I learned so much from Naomi, and she taught me how to block my brows, and I think I'm doing it now.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Derrick, and I will always think of you as my genie in a bottle.  Yes, I know that's a Christina song, but I've run out of Britney references!

RUPAUL	Give me a break.

DERRICK BARRY	Yes.

RUPAUL	We love you, Derrick Barry.  (laughing)

MICHELLE	"RuPaul's Drag Race" celebrates drag across America.  Presenting the Kinsey Sicks.

THE KINSEY SICKS	(sing) RuPaul's Drag Race.

THE KINSEY SICKS MEMBER	(sings) Start your engines.

THE KINSEY SICKS	(sing) RuPaul's Drag Race.

THE KINSEY SICKS MEMBER	(sings) May the best woman win.

MICHELLE	Coming up, straight out of Shreveport, Hurricane Chi Chi DeVayne, plus Katya returns to name Miss Congeniality as the grand finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race" keeps on keeping on.

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	(laughs)

RUPAUL	Welcome back to "RuPaul's Drag Race" grand finale.  Now, we are moments away from finding out if Bob The Drag Queen, Kim Chi, or Naomi Smalls will be crowned America's next drag superstar, but first the queen who has turned this season on its head.

RUPAUL	Let's take a look.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Laissez les bon temps roulez.  My name is Chi Chi DeVayne, and I don't get ready.  I stay ready.  (snapping) My drag is that real southern dragged out style of drag.

RUPAUL	Prove to us that you're a champion.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Not only have you guys taught me how to be a better entertainer, but you have taught me how to be a better person, and $, cannot buy that.  (snaps)

RUPAUL	Yes, Louisiana glamour.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE(laughs)

RUPAUL	When you came to "Drag Race," you had quit two jobs to be on the show.  How many jobs do you have now?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	I have one job, Ru, and I'm a full-time drag queen!

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	That's what's up.  That's what's up.

RUPAUL	How do fans react when they meet you?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Oh, my God, first time in New York, I'm in Times Square, and the shortest little Hispanic woman stopped me in the street, and she just instantly start crying.

RUPAUL	Wow.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	She explained it to me that I represented all of the people in the world to her that are out there struggling to make ends meet and who have a dream, and the dream has come true.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Dreams come true, y'all.  Dreams come true.

RUPAUL	And speaking of dreams, the "Dreamgirls" lip sync that you did, oh, honey, that was legendary, and I'm not the only one who thought so.  Take a look at this.

JENNIFER	You, Miss Chi Chi DeVayne, are a true inspiration.  I tell you that your heartfelt rendition of "And I'm Telling You" moved me, and honey, when those bees start flying right after you and I hit our high note, honey, you gave me life, and I'm gonna make you an official Dreamgirl.

RUPAUL	Do you have anything else you'd like to say?

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You have changed my life forever.

RUPAUL	Thank you.

CHI CHI DEVAYNE	You made my dreams come true.

RUPAUL	That is the sweetest thing.  I really appreciate that.  I've been watching you for a long time, and to have you finally on the show is really my honor.

RUPAUL	All right, now it's time to announce the winner of this year's Miss Congeniality.  All the way from Moscow by way of Boston and a pit stop in Pacoima, it's Katya.

RUPAUL	Hi, Katya.

KATYA	Hi, Ru.  Hey, listen, I brought you some water.  Are you thirsty?

RUPAUL	So Katya, what have you been up to?

KATYA	Oh, my God, what haven't I been up to?  Listen, I learned horseback riding.  I've been doing macrame.  I visited, like,  out of the  continents in the world.  It's been a whirlwind.  It's been a…

RUPAUL	All right, yeah, well, is there something you want to tell me?  I mean…

KATYA	I--well, okay, yeah, I'm not technically bisexual.  I mean, I'm open.  I'm open…

RUPAUL	No, no, no, no, n--no.

KATYA	No, no, I am open--listen, I am…

RUPAUL	I'm talking about what you came out here for.  You remember?  You came…

KATYA	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, look at this thing.  Okay.

RUPAUL		Yeah.

KATYA	Oh, yeah, hold--will you hold this water for me please?

RUPAUL	Yeah, sure.

KATYA	The winner…

KATYA	…of season eight Miss Congeniality and a cash prize of $,…

KATYA	Yup.  Courtesy of the all-new Fiat x crossover is…Cynthia Lee Fontaine!

RUPAUL	Cynthia, is there anything you'd like to say?

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	This is very important for me because experiencing cancer give me the opportunity just only to be stronger than ever and represent my community the best that I can, and the only way that we can do that is funny and showing the cuckoo to the world.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Thank you, RuPaul, so very much.

RUPAUL	Thank you.

CYNTHIA LEE FONTAINE	Thank you to my sisters.

RUPAUL	And thanks to all of you for voting.  Thank you.

RUPAUL	Tyra Sanchez.

TYRA SANCHEZ	Be the biggest, baddest bitch of them all, a royal bitch.  Love, America's sweetheart.

RUPAUL	Raja.

RAJA	In the prophetic words of a wise mystic, express yourself.

RAJA	It is now your duty to honor a divine legacy and to leave an indelible imprint on herstory.

RUPAUL	Sharon Needles.

SHARON NEEDLES	My advice?  Just be yourself.  Well, unless nobody likes you.  In that case, just be Alaska.

RUPAUL	Chad Michaels.

CHAD MICHAELS	Snap out of it, ladies.  Just do you, or when in doubt, just do Cher, bitch.

RUPAUL	Jinkx Monsoon.

JINKX MONSOON	When the bitches come for you, murder them with kindness, and don't forget, the best thing about monsoon season is it happens annually.  (laughs)

RUPAUL	Bianca Del Rio.

BIANCA DEL RIO	I've got some advice for this year's winner.  Enjoy the ride, and pay your damn taxes.  Right, Sharon?  Jinkx?  Raja?

RUPAUL	And America's reigning drag superstar, Violet Chachki.

SINGER	I'm telling, I'm telling.  I'm telling the truth now.  We're all born naked and the rest is drag.  I'll say it again.  It's never been the clothes that make the man.  Nothing can.  Leave all your baggage behind.  And I said I'm telling, I'm telling.  I'm telling the truth now.  I'm telling, I'm telling, I'm telling the truth now.  I'm telling, I'm telling.  I'm telling the truth now.  We're all born naked, and the rest is drag.

RUPAUL	Wow.  Violet, what has your year been like?

VIOLET CHACHKI	My year has been incredible.  I've worked with some of the best people in the industry, the fashion world, the burlesque world, the art world.  I've gotten validation, people that I respected for years and years and years, so it's been the most personally gratifying year of my life.

VIOLET CHACHKI	I am so thankful to RuPaul, all the fans.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I love you guys.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Violet.  Now, in addition to the title of America's next drag superstar, the winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race" will receive a crown and scepter provided by Fierce Drag Jewels, a sickening supply of makeup from Anastasia Beverly Hills, and a cash prize of $,.

RUPAUL	Now…

RUPAUL	…the time has come to crown our queen.  Bob The Drag Queen, Kim Chi, Naomi Smalls.  As always, I've consulted with the judges and the fans, but the final decision is mine to make.  The winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race," America's next drag superstar is…

RUPAUL	Bob The Drag Queen.

SINGER	If I dream everything I wanna be.  If I dream all the possibilities.  If you just believe in your wildest dreams, they will come true.  They will come true.

RUPAUL	My queen, is there anything you have to say?

BOB THE DRAG QUEEN	Yes.  I have too much to say, but I'm gonna keep it to one thing.  Take whatever you love about yourself, and walk into the world purse first!

SINGER	If I dream everything I wanna be.  If I dream all the possibilities.  If you just believe in your wildest dreams, they will come true.  They will come true.

ALL	Amen!

RUPAUL	All right, now let the music play!

SINGER	If I dream everything I wanna be.  If I dream all the possibilities.  If you just believe in your wildest dreams, they will come true.  They will come true.
