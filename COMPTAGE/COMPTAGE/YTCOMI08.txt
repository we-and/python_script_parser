STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always wanted to see the world. 

STORYTELLER	And one day...

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends. Really Useful around the World!
STORYTELLER	Thomas visits Australia!

STORYTELLER 	Thomas was taking some passengers across the Australian Savanna. Thomas was very happy. He felt like he was being Really Useful.
STORYTELLER	He passed a yellow sign.
STORYTELLER	Thomas knew that a yellow sign meant that he was supposed to be careful...

STORYTELLER	...but be careful of what?!

STORYTELLER	A little further down the line, Thomas saw the sign again.

STORYTELLER	It looked like it had an animal on it, but it wasn’t an animal Thomas had seen before.

STORYTELLER	Untiiil...

STORYTELLER	Thomas braked suddenly – bouncing his passengers about like peas in a frying pan!
STORYTELLER	“It’s the animal from the sign.” Said Thomas. 

STORYTELLER	Thomas waited for the animal to step off the line. But it didn’t seem to want to go anywhere. Thomas blew  his whistle very hard...

STORYTELLER	...but the animal didn’t move. 

STORYTELLER	“What’s the hold up, mate?” said one of the passengers.
STORYTELLER	“Cinders and ashes!” said Thomas. “All my passengers are having to wait! Because of one animal!”
STORYTELLER	Thomas was cross. “You silly animal,” said Thomas. “You’re not being Really Useful at all!”
STORYTELLER	“It’s a kangaroo!” said another passenger.
STORYTELLER	“A... kangaroo?” said Thomas. “So that’s what it’s called!”

STORYTELLER	“And, look!” said a passenger. “The kangaroo’s got a little ‘un - a joey!”
STORYTELLER	Thomas saw that the kangaroo was carrying a baby kangaroo.	
STORYTELLER	“That kangaroo is carrying a passenger! Just like me!” laughed Thomas. “I guess she was being Really Useful after all!”
