(THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL 4)




SAILOR	Boatswain!  There’s a storm up ahead!

BOATSWAIN	Captain, look over there! There's a storm coming.

CAPTAIN	Take command!

BOATSWAIN	Lower the topsail and the topgallant sail! Raise the headsail! Move faster! You are all moving like turtles!

SAILOR	A woman!

BOATSWAIN	Lady’s bloomers?!

CAPTAIN	A woman! Everybody search!

BOATSWAIN	Here! Check all the cabins! Go!

SAILOR	Look over there!

SIRKO	Looks like Captain's assistant is a girl! 

MISS DUDLEY	Help me!

PETER THE FIRST	What are you doing here? 

MISS DUDLEY	The London police were looking for me because of you!

PETER THE FIRST	Give me the keys!

MISS DUDLEY	Don’t touch me!

PETER THE FIRST	Hey, stop it! Or I'll show you “the Dragon's fist” punch!

BOATSWAIN	Hold on! Hold on tight!  Everybody! On deck! There’s a huge wave! Where's the Captain? 

KHOMA	Oh, my Lord, with your heavenly power, God, help me overcome this storm and deliver our ship from its evil embrace!
 
BOATSWAIN	Rocks ahead! 

MISS DUDLEY	Oh Lord!

PETER THE FIRST	I'll go between! 

BOATSWAIN	We can’t, can we?..
ZHONG HAO	ZhongZhe, hold on!

SAILOR	I see the light! 

BOATSWAIN	Well, everyone alive?  I don’t’  see the captain.

PETER THE FIRST	What is it? Who is there?

CAPTAIN	Yo ho ho and a bottle of… Whiskey!

BOATSWAIN	Oh, he’s alive.

CAPTAIN	The storm has its perks! It tipped the bottle right into my mouth, and delivered me a snack!

BOATSWAIN	Lock him up! And no more whiskey for him!

CAPTAIN	Hey! What are you doing? Hey, Put me down! Or I’ll throw you to the sharks!

BOATSWAIN	Cheers to the Tsar - Hurrah! 

SAILORS	Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! 

BOATSWAIN	I've never seen such seamanship! Only Peter the First could have saved us!

JONATHAN GREEN	Dear Miss Dudley, I miss the touch of Your gentle hands! I often recall the quiet evenings we shared in England, when you and I, alone, would study geography. They were, in a word, magical. My journey follows the Silk Road.  Once, it was the whole world's primary trading route. Soon, we will see the Great Wall of China. I wish you could stand next to me as we see this wonder of the world!  My assistant has stayed on the roof of the carriage the entire way. Despite my efforts, I have not managed to persuade him to come down and ride in the carriage with me, where it is comfortable. The boy is strangely unyielding… It's the last of the water Cheng. Here, take it!

CHENG LAN	No, thanks.

JONATHAN GREEN	Take it! We have crossed the whole of China to reach Chengs’ village. There, on the edge of the Celestial Empire, is a port where merchants from all over the world sail to buy tea. If I am fortunate, I'll find a British ship there. If I am fortunate, I'll find a British ship there.

CHENG LAN	My village has changed. I don't  recognize it anymore. There are dark clouds over Dragon Cave. And there's a fortress wall that wasn't there before. What can you see?

JONATHAN GREEN	Oh God! Cheng!  There are soldiers beating up the farmers. Come! Look!

CHENG LAN	Something is very wrong, my people are suffering. I must help save them!


JONATHAN GREEN	I'm sick of this! Let's find another port, there is nothing but trouble there. Let's turn the carriage around and go the other way!

CHENG LAN	But I cannot leave! I am the True Princess! Goodbye, dear Jonathan… 

GUARD	That tofu we took from the merchant yesterday was delicious!

GUARD#2	Yes, it was.

GUARD	Should we get more today? 

GUARD#2	Of course.

SELLER	Care to buy some tea? It's half-price today!  We sell our tea for a pittance to pay the princess's taxes! 

VILLAGER	We can't go on like this... 

YOUNG VILLAGER	Shhh! Be quiet!  They have ears everywhere! You want to go to prison?

AFRICAN MERCHANT	No, no! Cheaper! 

TEA SELLER	That's my lowest price.

AFRICAN MERCHANT	Half that price and I’ll take everything! 

TEASELLER	Fine, sold! Did you all hear that? He bought all the tea! We'll eat meat tonight!  Here, quickly! Hurry, hurry! Quickly! Here!

GENERAL	Make way! Now get lost!  Spread out! Surround the square! 

WITCH SERVANT	Filthy peasants! Pay the gold and be gone! We do so much for you begging the Dragon not to be angry and to grant us the healing tea!

OLD MAN	Please accept this, Lord Treasurer.

WITCH SERVANT	Play on. Gold! Where did you hide the gold? Just hand it over if you value your own homes.

TEA SELLER	You know the tea isn't what it was. My customers spit it out most of what they buy. That’s all I have.

WITCH SERVANT	And this… what is this? You thought you could even shortchange us, imbeciles? You stupid nitwits you don't understand that we have magical powers to always know what is real gold?! These tricks with iron won't work on us! You buffoons! And who do we have here?

GRANDFATHER	How long? For how long are you going to rob us all? The tea has lost its powers! You'll make us all sick!


GRANDMOTHER	Please, don’t!

WITCH SERVANT	Oh, so we have a rebel on our hands! Arrest him! The Dragon will deal with him tomorrow!

GRADDAUGHTER	What are you doing? Stop! Grandpa! Grandpa! Let him go! 

CHENG LAN	Got you! How could you? You traitor!

WITCH SERVANT	The Moon has come down to earth! Happiness has graced our village! You've finally returned!

LI HONG	Li Hu, you have to leave! It's too dangerous!

VILLAGERS	Get down!

WITCH SERVANT	It hurts! Oh, princess!I've seen the error of my ways!

CHENG LAN	I saw you robbing these people. Whatever happened to being a White Magician. You swore to serve the people and the great Dragon!

LI HONG	Princess! What are you doing here?

CHENG LAN	Li Hong?

LI HONG	Do you think you can walk around unrecognized?

CHENG LAN	You are my friend. I don't want to fight you!

LI HONG	Why are you torturing us like this?

SOLDIERS	Hep-one, hep-two, hep-three... 

WITCH SERVANT	Princess! Princess! Here you go, this is all for you! My Moon! Oh, my Sun! I think I saw her! 

WITCH	Who?

WITCH SERVANT	The real Princess.

WITCH	What? So did you or did you not see the Princess?

WITCH SERVANT	I'm not sure that was really her. Oh, Great Sovereign of the lands! You are the Sun! I mean the Moon,mmmm...

WITCH	Shut your mouth! Get off!! Gather the people immediately… and make everyone see that the Dragon obeys me! I'll have to put on that vile mask of her face again… Such a shame to hide my beautiful face!

MAIDSERVANT	Yes, Princess. So pretty!

WITCH	Soon the time will come, when… When I finally recover the Dragon Seal, and show them all my true face!

WITCH SERVANT	Allow me to introduce the Princess, the True Beauty and a Great Ruler chosen by the Dragon! She is always delighted to greet and welcome the foreign guests!

JONATHAN GREEN	Let me introduce myself! My name is Jonathan Green. I'm a scientist and a Cartographer! I draw maps of the places that I've visited.

WITCH SERVANT	Here you go my Princess.

WITCH	This map shows the lands all the way from here to Europe. We could ship our tea there by land not just by sea. What is the purpose of your visit?

JONATHAN GREEN	I took a detour from my journey to see your famous Dragon. Are you the legendary Princess of the White Wizards… and the keeper of the secret of the healing tea?

WITCH	Yes, I am the Princess, the Master of the Dragon.

JONATHAN GREEN	I have an assistant Cheng Lan.. He has a he has a remarkable resemblance to you. I mean you could be twins. That’s uncanny! You are not related, are you? 

WITCH	Indeed... We do look alike.  Can we show him the Dragon?
