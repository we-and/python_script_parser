GEORGIA	Hi, ladies.

MAMA MCGURSKY	You know, it's been years since I've had a professional massage.

MAMA MCGURSKY	Not quite sure how I feel about another man's hands running all over my body.

MAMA MCGURSKY	I think Papa would prefer it if I had a lady.

SHERRY	Where's the fun in that?

SHERRY	Uh, when's the last time your husband gave you a proper massage?

MAMA MCGURSKY	You know, you're right.

MAMA MCGURSKY 	Papa usually just likes to get right to it.

MAN	Family is just so boring, you know.

MAN	Why bring family?

MAN	You should choose your friends.

MAN	And I tell you what, I can be your little friend.

LAURA JANE	You know, actually, I'm really excited, though, I can't wait to move on with Tom.

LAURA JANE	I mean, I'm in it for life.

LAURA JANE	I'm excited.

MAN	I can't wait, either.

LAURA JANE	We don't have food, flowers, the little doily things for the table.

GEORGIA	Did you see that guy?

GEORGIA	He was like a dick with teeth!

PAPA MCGURSKY	So, is this what's it like in your big American cities, then?

GEORGIA	No, it's Jamaica, man.

MAMA MCGURSKY	Fortunately, I'm not a prude because everything around here is having sex, especially the birds.

LANCE	Well, this place is paradise!

PAPA MCGURSKY	Lance, my boy. How was your trip in, son?

LAURA JANE	I'm getting married at a swingers resort.

LANCE	A swingers resort, like a nudist colony?

LANCE	Well, are you kidding me? All right.

LANCE	This all goes back to Tom, this is Tom's fault.

LANCE	This is a nudist colony?

LANCE	You're sick, buddy!

LANCE	All right.

LANCE	Everybody just calm down, let's figure out a plan B. 

HOWARD	Yup.

LANCE	Hi, there. I'm Lance, are you the manager of this place?

HOWARD	Absolutely.

HOWARD	Make yourself comfortable, take your jacket off.

LANCE	Okay, thank you. Thanks.

HOWARD	Hey, while you're at it, go ahead and take your pants off, too.

LANCE	I'm sorry?

HOWARD	If you want.

LANCE	My pants?

HOWARD	How can I help you, Larry?

LANCE	It's Lance, but that's okay.

LANCE	Well, I wanted to lodge a com…

HOWARD	Oh, you like that?

HOWARD	It's my ex-wife, former guest.

LANCE	I wanted to lodge a complaint.

HOWARD	Oh, God. You had me worried for a second.

HOWARD	I have a lot of guests come in here wanting to lodge something, usually not complaints.

HOWARD	Upper management, at a beautiful adult swingers resort.

HOWARD	And for the life of me,

HOWARD	I cannot walk out those office doors without a top or bottom.

HOWARD	Can I help you, Larry?

LANCE	Well, uh, first of all, this is a top notch resort, so congratulations to you.

LANCE	Um, I was just… Had a question about the activities.

HOWARD	There's zip line, paragliding, bungee jumping.

LANCE	All nude.

LANCE	Those are all totally nude activities you've mentioned.

HOWARD	That's true.

HOWARD	Actually the bungee jump is closed due to an incident last week, a guy, older fellow, late 's, early 's, jumps, old-timer's got incredible form, his head is at a safe distance, but his balls extend just enough to tap the sand really hard. Put him in the hospital… died the next day.

LANCE	I’m sorry to hear that.

HOWARD	Nothing related to the bungee jump.

LANCE	My condolences.

HOWARD	I think I understand what's happening here.

LANCE	Look, my sister is getting married this weekend, albeit to a total putz, but still I wanna make sure it's special for her and not a sex surge, do you understand?

HOWARD	I got to thank you for your concerns.

HOWARD	I'm taking baby steps to improving the staff tacked around here, you know what I mean?

HOWARD	Here's what I'm gonna do for you, Vance.

HOWARD	To make sure your stay is comfortable,

HOWARD	I'm gonna give you Groupons to our best clothing optional classes.

HOWARD	Try to enjoy yourselves.

HOWARD	Take it slow, too.

HOWARD	And that's my advice to you, Vince, that you do the same.

TOM	Sure you don't wanna come with us?

LANCE	I have a certain set of skills.

LANCE	Do you know what Krav Maga is?

TOM	No.

LANCE	See this, Tom?

LANCE	It's a fist.

LANCE	And it might be small, delicate even, like a snowflake, but it's not the size that matters, it's what you do with it. If you so much as harm my baby sister in the slightest, not even the splendid Canadian nationalized healthcare system will be able to save you.

LANCE	And by the way, that hat's fucking stupid.

RICKY	Lance, you should come, buddy.

RICKY	We got a bunch of guys, no women, it's a perfect sausage-fest.

IRA	Home grown, I call it the rasta Jew, man.

IRA	That's what I call it, man.

TOM	No, I… I'd end up on the floor of that boat passed out.

IRA	That's what happened to the captain.

LANCE	Something about her.

IRA	You should go talk to her, man.

LANCE	Oh, uh, yeah. Actually, we already met.

LANCE	She's, you know, she's going through kind of a hard time.

LANCE	She got left at the altar.

IRA	Yeah, man.

LANCE	Yeah. Very sad.

IRA	Broken heart, man.

LANCE	Yeah.

IRA	Hmm.

IRA	You should mend that heart with big Janelle right there.

IRA	Getting an orgy going. I can watch.

IRA	You'd take her to the romper room, man, and you tie her up like a goat.

LANCE	No. You're not hearing what I'm saying.

LANCE	She's a nice girl. She just got left at the altar.

LANCE	She's going through kind of a rough time.

LANCE	If I were to say something to her, it'd be like, I don't know.

LANCE	"Would you like to go for a walk on the beach?" Something like that.

IRA	Yeah, man. Yeah, man.

LANCE	You see what I'm saying?

LANCE	Yeah.

LANCE	She is a really pretty woman.

LANCE	It does seem like she's looking over here though.

IRA/	Hold the gaze.

LANCE	Yeah. You think so?

IRA	She's almost as beautiful as my wife.

LANCE	You're married?

IRA	Yeah, man.

LANCE	So, what are you doing in this cabana right beside me?

IRA	I was noticing your pants. They're, uh, really nice.

IRA	What kind of pants are those?

SINGER	(music lyrics)

TOM	I think I hear the waterfall right over here somewhere.

TOM	All right. It's just right over here.

LAURA JANE	Okay.

SINGER	(music lyrics)

LAURA JANE	Come on.

SINGER	(music lyrics)

TOM	So… you wanna just take our clothes off?

LANCE	Are you okay?

LANCE	Georgia, what did you discover about Tom and Ricky?

LANCE	Did Ricky fellate Tom?

GEORGIA	So, uh, Ricky… Ricky is, um, straight, yeah.

RICKY	Straight as an arrow for you, babe.

GEORGIA	And, you know, he's surprisingly… deep and, um, spiritual, philosophical individual.

RICKY	Very philosophical, Shakespeare once said…

LANCE	Did you blow Tom?

LANCE	Why are you looking at her?

LANCE	Simple question, did you go down on him?

RICKY	I'm not sure what happened. It was a big night out.

RICKY	We took some pills and Tom woke up in some chick's room.

RICKY	But it's all my fault.

LANCE	Okay.

LANCE	I'm gonna, uh, go grab a wet wipe.

LANCE	Okay. A guy as dumb as Tom has to leave a few clues here and there.

LANCE	esus Christ.

LANCE	It's just you, Lance.

LANCE	Oh, gee.

LANCE	Shit. Luckily, this is all inclusive.

LAURA JANE	Oh. 

TOM	Oh.

LAURA JANE	Okay.

TOM	Can you get it off?

LAURA JANE	Yup.

LAURA JANE	Oh.

LAURA JANE	Hoo.

TOM	Dude, what the fuck, man? Shit.

LAURA JANE	Tom, don't you have any boundaries?

LANCE	Yeah, I got boundaries.

LANCE	I also got a couple of questions for this guy right here, your fiancé.

LANCE	I just had a little chat with your best man.

TOM	Yeah.

LANCE	Yeah, okay. Yeah.

LAURA JANE	Look, Lance, Tom is a good guy.

LAURA JANE	I love him and we're getting married, and you have to learn how to just deal with it.

LANCE	Oh, you want me to deal with it?

LANCE	Let me tell you something about this so-called "good guy," all right?

LANCE	And this hurts me to tell you this, but he slept with another woman.

TOM	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no.

LANCE	Sit down! That's right, honey.

LANCE	He fornicated with another girl.

LAURA JANE	What?

LANCE	Yeah. Tell her.

LANCE	Explain it to her.

LAURA JANE	What is he talking about, Tom?

LANCE	Yeah, what am I talking about, Tom?

LANCE	You know what? Let me handle this one.

LANCE	My investigation so far has yielded the information that, uh, there is a woman named Anna.

LANCE	Does that ring a bell, Tom, if that's even your real name?

TOM	I... I... I... I don't... I don't know... I don't... I don't…

TOM	I…

LANCE	What, is English your second language?

LANCE	Speak.

TOM	Okay.

LAURA JANE	Just tell me what happened.

TOM	I... I woke up in another woman's room and I don't...

TOM	I don't think I did anything.

LANCE	Oh, ho, ho.

LANCE	You woke up in another woman's room.

LANCE	Are you hearing this, honey?

TOM	I... Okay.

TOM	I had... I had... I had no shirt on but my shorts were on.

TOM	My shorts were on…

LANCE	His shirt was off

LANCE	but he thinks he had his underoos on. What the fuck are you talking about?

TOM	But my... My shoes was... My shorts were on…

LANCE	She's furious.

TOM	…and my... My shoes were on and... And I don't...

TOM	I wouldn't... I wouldn't do anything. I know myself.

LANCE	He thinks that he had clothes on.

LANCE	Starting to see what I mean here?

TOM	I... dude that's not... I'm... It's not what you think.

TOM	I didn't cheat.

LANCE	Go walk it off, sis. I'm right behind you. You're disgusting.

LANCE	I agree with what she said a hundred percent, and so far as I can tell, you're just one more guy who cheats on his fiancé. And I think that that's just horrible.

LANCE	And this room's a goddamn pigsty.

LAURA JANE	Mom, Dad, I have to tell you something.

LAURA JANE	Oh. What the...

LAURA JANE	What the fuck?

WOMAN	You must be the bride. Congratulations.

SHERRY	Hi, honey.

LAURA JANE	Mom?

LANCE	He had us all fooled.

LANCE	You got to admit, you did seem pretty happy.

LANCE	And I'm sorry that I wasn't more happy for you.

LAURA JANE	Well, I didn't exactly always make it easy for you to be happy for me.

LANCE	You don't have to say that.

LAURA JANE	I'm just sorry that I never really tried to understand you.

LANCE	Hey, to me, you were the only person that never really did understand me, all right?

LANCE	And, well, I'm sorry I didn't treat you like a real brother.

LAURA JANE	Lance, you're better than any real brother I could ever ask for.

LANCE	Yeah?

LAURA JANE	Yeah.

TOM	Please, just talk to me. Please.

LAURA JANE	Don't talk to me.

LAURA JANE	I can't even look at you.

WINSTON	Excuse me. Is everything okay?

LAURA JANE	No, I need a car to the airport. I'm leaving.

WINSTON	What about your beautiful wedding?

LAURA JANE	It's not happening.

TYRONE	At this point, it's too late.

TYRONE	There is no cabs, no flights out.

LANCE	Winston, she's got to fly out tonight.

WINSTON	I'll get her a cab and the first flight out in the morning.

LANCE	It's a great idea.

LANCE	Tonight, you either stay with Georgia or you stay with myself, and buddy, your ticket’s been punched.

LANCE	Laura, come this way.

LANCE	Thank you, Winston.

WINSTON	You know, it would've been such a wonderful wedding.

SINGER	(music lyrics)

MANFRED	Morning, son.

TOM	Morning, Dad.

TOM	I don't really know what to do.

TOM	I thought it was what you and Mom have.

MANFRED	Well, your mom and I have... discovering new things, too.

MANFRED	We've been together a long time and the flame starts to die a little bit, you know, not like that seven-year itch kind of thing, but something a whole lot more.

MANFRED	You know, so you try something. You don't think you're gonna like it but you do.

MANFRED	So you try something else.

MANFRED	You know, every time I see you and Laura Jane together, I...

MANFRED	I just think, "Boy, don't ever lose that."

TOM	Do you think it's too late to fix this?

MANFRED	Well, son, in the end, nothing is too late.

TOM	Dad, what do I do?

MANFRED	I can't tell you that, son.

MANFRED	That's up to you to decide.

TOM	Worst fucking day ever.

TOM	Hey, man, can I get a couple, um, a couple shots, just... just line them up there and I'll take them.

JON JOHNSON	Tommy, you look ridiculous.

JON JOHNSON	So what, you fucked up?

JON JOHNSON	Now listen to me carefully.

JON JOHNSON	I have three words of advice for you, kid.

JON JOHNSON	Chase your dreams, fulfill your destiny, and go get a haircut. You look like a moron.

JON JOHNSON	Quit feeling sorry for yourself, sober up, take a shower and go get her.

JON JOHNSON	And use deodorant. I'm a hallucination, I can still smell you.

IRA	Mr. Tom, hurry up, man.

IRA	She's a runaway, man.

TOM	All right, let's go, let's go.

IRA	All right, Andy.

IRA	Rip these roads, man.

TOM	All right, let's go. How long until we get there?

IRA	Two hours, man.

TOM	Fuck.

WOMAN	He's cute.

WOMAN	He is.

ANNA	So wasted.

ANNA	I couldn't even take his shoes off.

ANNA	That's how loyal he is.

WOMAN	Oh. Who's Laura anyways?

ANNA	I don't know. I don't care. 

WOMAN	Oh, man, I just love him.

TOM	Oh, I need to throw up.

ANNA	It's a shame.

ANNA	He loved his fucking girlfriend.

WOMAN	Who's Laura?

GEORGIA	Oh, fuck.

TOM	Oh, Laura.

WOMAN	Who's that?

TOM	Thanks, guys.

IRA	All right, Tom.

IRA	Make sure you tell her that you love her and that she's the only woman in the world, and you take her to the romper room and you tie her up like a goat.

TOM	All right. Thanks. Yeah.

LAURA JANE	Hello?

GEORGIA	Laura?

LAURA JANE	Georgia?

GEORGIA	I have something to tell you.

GEORGIA	Laura, can you hear me?

LAURA JANE	I can't... I can't hear you.

GEORGIA	Laura, he didn't do it.

SINGER	(music lyrics)

TOM	I really...I really messed up and I can't stop thinking about you and I was... I was... I was running around the hotel looking for you and…

LAURA JANE	Stop. I know you would never do anything to hurt me.

TOM	This weekend has been... It's been crazy and with, you know, the family and...I can't imagine my life without you.

TOM	I just... I just had... had to tell you.

LAURA JANE	Can you just shut up and kiss me?

SINGER	(music lyrics)

IRA	Hey, uh, Mr. Manfred, sir.

IRA	Mr. Manfred, sir.

MANFRED	Oh, my God.

IRA	I'm sorry. This isn't a bad time, is it?

IRA	I was hoping I could maybe talk to you about that business proposal.

IRA	You have a few minutes to talk?

MANFRED	How much?

IRA	Uh, I'm sorry. I don't...

MANFRED	How much?

MANFRED	How much for you to leave me and my family alone for the rest of our lives?

IRA	Five hundred?

MANFRED	Half million dollars?

IRA	Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

IRA	Not a half million dollars, like, I was thinking five hundred dollars.

IRA	I... I... I already got , saved up so that would put me at , which should be a nice nest egg to open a little dry cleaner right here on the island.

MANFRED	Who do I make that out to?

IRA	Ira Goldstein, sir.

MANFRED	Good job.

IRA	Good doing business with you.

IRA	On second thought, would you maybe, uh, pay me in cash?

IRA	Check's totally fine.

IRA	Don't even worry about it.

IRA	Thanks, Mr. Manfred.

LANCE	Uh, first off, I've been down here a couple of days now,

LANCE	and I've gotten the chance to know both families and talk to a lot of people about Tom here, and I've heard what a charming, kind, smart fella he is.

LANCE	And I'm the luckiest guy in the world because he's gonna take care of my baby sister, which is great.

LANCE	And I wouldn't have it any other way. Thank you.

PAPA MCGURSKY	Great job, Tommy. I'm proud of you.

MANFRED	Well, we did it, didn't we folks?

PAPA MCGURSKY	Yes, sir.

MANFRED	Huh?

PAPA MCGURSKY	Yeah.

MANFRED	I don't think that any of us thought that we would end up here.

MANFRED	Two great, very different families.

MANFRED	Laura Jane, I am honored to call you my daughter.

MANFRED	If I... If I could just take one more second to say something

MANFRED	to my beautiful wife, Sherry.

MANFRED	For so many years I have been obsessed with my work.

MANFRED	But I've realized that the only thing that matters is you.

PAPA MCGURSKY	But the one thing I hope these kids learn is that it doesn't matter where you are or when it is.

PAPA MCGURSKY	But if you have the person you love standing next to you by your side, you're in the right place at the right time.

MAMA MCGURSKY	And if you have that, you will have something that will see you through a whole host of hard times, which include but are not limited to, the occasional dalliance, premature ejaculation, no ejaculation, hemorrhoids, that thing they do where they grind their teeth, insomnia, loose teeth, failing vision, halitosis.

PAPA MCGURSKY	Menopause.

LAURA JANE	I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

PAPA MCGURSKY	Give it, boy. Give it. Go.

SINGER	(music lyrics)

LANCE	There's a... there's a...you got a dolphin...

LANCE	Hey. Hey. Look. Look to your left.

LANCE	To your left. No. I'm not waving to you.

LANCE	No.

DOLPHIN	Retreat.

DOLPHIN	We'll be back.

LOLA	I'm great.

LOLA	You saved my life.

LANCE	If you can believe it, I'm terrified of the water.

LANCE	At least I used to be.

LOLA	You're my hero.
	
LANCE	Not a hero.

LANCE	I'm just Lance.

LOLA	Lance, kiss me, you fool.

SINGER	(music lyrics)

SHERRY	The director is losing it in the background.

LANCE VO	Just because you don't know where you are doesn't mean you're lost, Lance.

LANCE VO	It sounds like something Poppy would say.

LANCE VO	I guess it all worked out for the best.

LANCE VO	That being said, where the hell am I?

IRA	We're about to have our sixth kid.

IRA	And Mr. Manfred, sir, we're gonna name that kid after you, and I don't care if it's a boy or a girl.

TYRONE	Take me.

MAMA MCGURSKY	But you see, that's an area I actually don't have a complaint about.

MAMA MCGURSKY	Papa, although he looks large and heavy…

MAMA MCGURSKY	is large and heavy.

MAN	I'd like to dedicate a song to all the girls that slept with Ricky.

TYRONE	Come back.

MAN	Yup. Ricky’s all up in ya.

MAN	Ricky is a ninja.

MAN	Ricky’s all up in ya. Ricky is a ninja.

MAN	Ricky’s all up in ya. And Ricky is a ninja. All up in Jamaica.

MAN	Ricky's all up in ya.
