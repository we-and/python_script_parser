(ROCKY RESCUE)

THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...Working as a team.

THOMAS	It's usually Rocky who comes to the rescue when one of us gets de-railed..

THOMAS	...But when Rocky came off the tracks, no one could agree how to help him!

THOMAS	Everyone wanted to be the one who rescued Rocky, and everyone thought they could do it without help from anyone else!

THOMAS	But Rocky is a big heavy crane and no matter how we tried, none of us could lift him on our own.

THOMAS	Then Rocky told us that we could do it if we all worked together.

THOMAS	So we all worked as a team. Rocky was heavy, but eventually we managed to get him back on the tracks.

THOMAS	When we worked together, we did something none of us could do on our own!

THOMAS	That's why working as a team is a great thing to do!
