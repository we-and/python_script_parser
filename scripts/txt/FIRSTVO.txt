KAREN		What we wanna know is where we can stay.

OPHELIA	It looks like we’re all gonna be roommates.  

LISA	Really…

JAMES	We’re free to do what we want, when we want to with who we want.

OPHELIA	You’re an incredible asshole.

FREDDY	I fuckin’ love college.

KAREN	Is this guy for real?

OPHELIA	Aw, yeah.

JAMES	Who’s your daddy?

BLOND	Brian Talbert.  Why?

LISA	I just want a good education.

JOSE	Whatta ya talkin’ about?

JAMES	Please be gentle.  This is my first time, ya know.

KIMBERLY	Don’t worry.  I’ll show you a move or two.

JAMES	Something seems to be happening down there.

KIMBERLY	Ooh.  It sure is.  Mm…

JAMES	Nice.

KIMBERLY	(light laugh)

JAMES	Now what do we do?

KIMBERLY	We fuck.

KIMBERLY	… Oh yes…

JAME	… Okay…

KIMBERLY	Not bad for your first time, huh?

JAMES	Ah… (light laugh)  Well, give me a few minutes and I’ll be ready for my second time.

KIMBERLY	mm.

OPHELIA	James…

JAMES	Mm.  Oh…

KIMBERLY	Who’s that?

JAMES	That’s Ophelia.  My ex girlfriend.

KIMBERLY	Hi.  I’m Kimberly…  When did you guys break up?

JAMES	About five seconds ago.

JAMES	Ophelia!  … Ophelia.  C’mon, I’m not gonna give you some half-assed excuses.

OPHILIA	Glad to see you moving on.  Really, I am.  I’m a little surprised after what you asked me last night.

JAMES	Look, I meant what I said, alright, but I got your answer loud and clear.  ‘Kay, no harm, no foul.  We’re free to do what we want, when we want to, with who we want.

OPHELIA	Look, I didn’t come here to fight or to judge.

JAMES	Then why are you here?

DEAN	James Tyler?

OPHELIA	To let you know Dean Loward is on his way.

JAMES	Great.  Hey, hey, yo, ya know.  Now the party can really start.

DEAN	I’m afraid that’s an impossibility.

JAMES	Oh, really, well, we got beer kegs comin’ and extremely morally loose strippers due any second.  Ya know…	

DEAN	And I have this piece of paper.  Do you have any clue what this is?

JAMES	Permission slip from your mom?

DEAN	It’s the deed to this dilapidated domicile.  At exactly 8 o’clock in the morning, the university’s now the proud owner of Omega House.

JAMES	Oh that, that’s great, because ya know, the, the hot water tank needs to be replaced and…

DEAN	Knock it off, you adolescent moron.  What I’m trying to convey to that pea brain of yours is that Omega House is over.  After 16 years of doing battle with this so-called fraternity, the victory is mine.

OPHELIA	Well, who’s going to be moving in?

DEAN	No one.  Ya know, as a matter of fact, I think I’m just going to let it sit here and rot.

JAMES	You can’t do that.

DEAN	I already have, Mr. Tyler…  Game over…  Have a nice day.

KIMBERLY	Hey, what’s going on?

JAMES	Looks like we both just got fucked.

JOSE	I don’t see my name here.  I know I applied for housing.  I know I did…

LISA	My dad sent the check and I saw him do it.  There has to be a mistake.

JOSE	You got in?

LISA	No.

FREDDY	What the fuck…

JOSE	You’re not on the list, either?

FREDDY	… Huh?

KAREN	Oh.  Did they mess up on your dorm assignments, too?

FREDDY	Yeah.  They fucked my shit up…

KAREN	That’s messed up.  My name’s not on the list.

LISA	Join the club…  Hi, my name’s Lisa.

KAREN	Hi, Karen.

LISA	Nice to meet you.

JOSE	Hi, I’m Jose.

KAREN	Hi…  And you are…?

FREDDY	Freddy.  Your designated fuck buddy.

KAREN	Shit.

FREDDY	What?

KAREN	That’s so funny, because I specifically asked for a handsome, charming, well-endowed fuck buddy.  And it looks like they screwed that one up, too.

LACEY	Ah, attention, students.  Unfortunately, there’s been a mix-up in the housing department.

KAREN	You think?

LACEY	So, if any of you don’t have a dorm, just follow me and we’ll get this all straightened out.

LISA	Okay…  I have a bad feeling about this…  (sighs)

DEAN	Lacey, would you file this for me, please.

LACEY	Yes, Sir.

DEAN	Thank you…  Now what?

KAREN	We’re been sitting here for over an hour.  Some of us are tired and some of us, are worried.  And some of us are being sexually harassed.  All we wanna know is where we’ll be staying.  Is that too much to ask?

DEAN	Alright, enough, enough.  Enough!  You have a point.  It’s an idiotic point, but you do have a point…  Follow me…

OPHELIA	(breathing, moaning, etc. – continuous)  …  Oh yeah, I’m over him.

GUY	You sure?

OPHELIA	Absolutely.  100%.  (moaning, etc. – continuous)  … James…

GUY	(sigh sound)

OPHELIA	Oop.

GUY	I guess a year’s too soon, huh?

OPHELIA	Sorry…  Dean Loward!

DEAN	For the love of god, put some clothes on, Ophelia!

OPHELIA	I’m sorry.

DEAN	You’re supposed to be a teacher’s assistant!  …  Meet your new wards.

OPHELIA	My what?

DEAN	The cast-a-ways.  The rejects.  The unwanted.

JOSE	What?

DEAN	There’s no room for them, here, so it’s up to you to find them a place to stay.

OPHELIA	What am I supposed to do?

DEAN	Well, you’re a smart girl.  Scholarship, if I recall.  I guess you’re gonna have to think of something.

OPHELIA	Ah, I, ah, I can’t do this by myself.  Ah, I need help.

DEAN	That may be, but for now, this motley crew, is your responsibility…

FREDDY	Got anything to eat?

OPHELIA	Hey.

DEAN	I wanna see James Tyler, in my office, now!

C0-ED	You have an amazing office.  

JAMES	Thank you.  Ya know, I’ve been in college for 6 years.  If I make it to 10, I get stock options. 

CO-ED	Oh… 

JAMES	Speaking of options, do you like to be on top, or bottom?

CO-ED	Mm…  I can’t believe I’m with a legend.

JAMES	Ooh, you’re making me blush.

JAMES	Oh yeah…  (moaning, etc. – continuous)  …  Ophelia.  Fuck…

CO-ED	What’s that?  Some legend you are.

JAMES	I got, a good publicist.   Fuck.

CO-ED	That, was a little disappointing.

JAMES	… Oh fuck.  Quick, get under the fucking desk and stay there.  Stay there.

DEAN	What the…  How did you get in here?

JAMES	  … Door?  It’s awesome.  It’s gotta handle and everything.  (very light laugh)

DEAN	Get away from my desk, Mr. Tyler.

JAMES	Ya know, ya know, I’d love to, but I’ve got an inner ear problem and if I get up too quickly, I could take a tumble.

DEAN	Get out now!!

JAMES	Fine.  Fine.  Jesus Christ.  What… what’s shakin’?  Ya know, what’s the rumpus?  What’s the 411?  Hm?

DEAN	Well, I’m feeling rather magnanimous today.  I’ve had a change of heart.  I am going to allow you to move back into the Omega House.

JAMES	Oh, huh, well, whatta ya know.  The Omega rises from the ashes, huh?

DEAN	Well, it’s not that easy.  There are conditions.  You’ll be in charge of others.

JAMES	Others?  … What others?

DEAN	They’re with Ophelia Leeson.  Do you know where her dorm is… ah, that’s right.  You’re already familiar with where her dorm room is…  This is your last chance, Mr. Tyler.  You screw this up, I’ll sign those expulsion papers, have you off this campus, faster than shit goes through a goose.  And I don’t care what you may or may not know about my thing with the thing… but this is your last chance.

JAMES	Yeah, well, Dean, ya know, we haven’t even discussed pay, yet, or bonuses.  I know you have a sizable package in mind, ‘cause I saw, the thing, with the thing.

DEAN	Get out!!  …

CO-ED	Hi…

DEAN	Get back in here!

OPHELIA	But you know that I can’t, I, I do, but…  I know… Fine…

FREDDY	It’ll be okay.  It’ll be fine.

LISA	I never, ya know, been away from home, before.  It’s my first time.

JOSE	Yeah, ha, me too.  I’m the first one in my family to actually go to college.

LISA	(very light laugh)  So, we’re all virgins to this.

JOSE	(very light laugh)

FREDDY	Wait, did someone say they’re a virgin?

KAREN	(laughs)  Why, do you wanna be the first one to disappoint her?

FREDDY	Oh, this monster don’t disappoint.

KAREN	(laughs)  (little girl voice)  Oh, look at this cute little monster.

LISA	I’m sure I’ll be fine.  We just need to have a little faith…

JOSE	It was my dad’s.

LISA	Oh, he gave it to you?

JOSE	Ah, my mom did, after he died.

LISA	I’m sorry…

JOSE	Naw.  My mom got remarried and she never got over him.  She named me Jose, after him.  And my brothers and my sister.

FREDDY	(light laugh)  No way.  You sister’s name’s Jose?

FREDDY	That’s…  messed up…  She hot?

OPHELIA	Well, it looks like we found you a place to stay.

LISA	Great.

OPHELIA	Yup.  It looks like we’re all going to be roommates.

FREDDY	(laughs)

KAREN	What!?  Ew.  I have to share a room with this creep?

FREDDY	College is awesome.

LISA	I can’t live with boys.

JOSE	I can’t stuffy here.

OPHELIA	Well, I’m all outta ideas.  We’re gonna need a miracle…

JAMES	Seek and ye shall find.

OPHELIA	Fuck…  What the hell are you doing here?

JAMES	(Indian accent)  Like Gandhi, I’m here to lead you all through the Red Sea.

OPHELIA	A, it wasn’t Gandhi, it was Moses and B, you’re not leading us anywhere.

JAMES	Au contraire.  D, where was C, and C, there it is.

OPHELIA	Listen, don’t you screw this up for me, James.  I need the Dean’s letter, if I’ve got any hope of getting that grant to go to Borneo.

JAMES	Baby, baby, baby, as if I’d screw this up…

KAREN	Is this guy for real?

OPHELIA	I wish he wasn’t.

JOSE	Wait, you have a place for us?

JAMES	Not just a place, young man, but a home.  A home with a roof, and a white picket fence and bedrooms for you all.  A home with a bathroom and a kitchen and a fully equipped sex dungeon.

FREDDY	Ah, dude, score.  Hey, I’ll race you all to the sex dungeon.  (laughs)

JAMES	Alright.

KAREN	Ew, there’s something seriously wrong with that boy.

JAMES	Yes, yes, yes, yes… Yes!  This is the place…

KAREN	Killer!

JOSE	I didn’t touch him, I swear.

KAREN	No, no, it’s his name…

JOSE	If you say so.

KAREN	Ah, ah, no way.  That place looks like it should be condemned.  

JOSE	It’s worse than the barrio.  

JAMES	C’mon…

LISA	I see dead people.

FREDDY	That’s sweet.  (laughs)

JAMES	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

KAREN	Killer, go pee, pee and poo, poo.

JAMES	C’mon.  Get yourself a room, man.  Go get a room…

FREDDY	Yes.

JAMES	Well?

KAREN	Are you kidding me?  This place was probably a shit hole when it was brand new.

JAMES	Ha.  Well, well, I see you’re a real glasses half full type of gal, ain’t ya?

KAREN	Actually, I’m the drink the god-damned glass dry, type of girl.

JAMES;	Oh, who’d have figured?

FREDDY	Well, I call the biggest bedroom.  (light laugh)

KAREN	What, are you five?

FREDDY	Why, ya like ‘em young?

JAMES	Alright, hey, alright.  So it needs a little bit of work, okay?  But here’s the good news.  Since we’re not technically on campus, the no drinking rule, doesn’t apply.  So, boo-ya!!

OPHELIA	Ah, no, James.

JAMES	Yes, we are gonna celebrate by throwing a party for our first night in our new house…  Funky, yeah.

FREDDY	Funky! …

JAMES	To the bitches!!

FREDDY	Yeah, I got the biggest room.  And ya know what they say about the size of a guy’s room?  …

FREDDY	God, I fuckin’ love college.

JAMES	Yeah!!

JOSE	Not up for the party?

LISA	I don’t really drink.

JOSE	Well, you look like you could use a glass of something.

LISA	C’mon in…

LISA	If my father could see me now, he’d have a heart attack.

JOSE	If my father could see me now…  To our first time…  On our own…  In college…  Away from home…

LISA	Ooh.  It tingles.  Mm…  Mm…  Ah…

KAREN	3 pairs.  Goo-ya!

GUY	I’m done playin’, Karen…

LISA	(drunk sounding)  I, I should really get some sleep right now.  (very light giggle)

JOSE	Okay.

LISA	Woo…  Woo…  I just want a good education… ya know? 

JOSE	Yeah.  I’m sure you will.

LISA	I hope so.  Everyone around here is about sex.  Sex, sex, sex.  It’s what everybody cares about…  Not you.  Mm.  You’re different.  Mm.  I’m so glad you’re here, Jose.  Cutie, patootie…  Mm… ah, mm…

JOSE	Me, too.

JAMES	One bad memory…

OPHELIA	Yeah and 300 good ones.

JAMES	Nope.

OPHELIA	Why is that, then?  Too drunk to remember?

JAMES	Only because they weren’t you…  (sighs)

OPHELIA	I’m not falling for your shit, again.

JAMES	Me, neither…

OPHELIA	James…

JAMES	Ophelia…

OPHELIA	I can’t do this.

JAMES	Then don’t…

FREDDY	I’m not doin’ it.  

DAD	You’re gonna be an Alpha Beta man whether you like it or not.  You’re a legacy.  No son of mine is getting’ his ass dumped in any god-damned over-flow housing.

FREDDY	Naw, this is stupid, man.

DAD	(phone V.O.)  It’s called initiation for a reason.

FREDDY	Yeah?  Why is that, Dad?

DAD	(phone V.O.)  Move the ball up the field.

FREDDY	What, does that mean?

DAD	It means, there’s no ‘I’ in quit.

FREDDY	Yes there is.

DAD	You do what it takes to get into that fraternity, or you’re dead to me.

FREDDY	Oh! …

DAD	Hang up the phone, num-nut.  I gotta make a call…

KAREN	Killer, be quiet…  Killer, shh… No bark.

FREDDY	Whoa, I can explain.

KAREN	Give me one good reason I shouldn’t let Killer loose on you, right now.

FREDDT	You kidding me, right?  I mean, I’ve taken craps bigger than that thing.

KAREN	Really?  Killer, sick him…  I’m waiting.

FREDDY	My dad made me do it.

DAD	(phone V.O.)  Pussy.

KAREN	Get out.  Now.  And you can leave the web cam with me…  Pervert.

JAMES	Listen to me very closely, my boy.  I did not get to be Dean at the University, by making pizza delivery moron’s lives easy.  Okay, I’m ripped to the tits on drinks and drugs, here.  There’s no fuckin’ way I’m getting up to answer the door…  Yes, I want you to break in…  Yes, I’ll fight you for the money…  Yes, I’ll pay more if you force the cow out where the sun don’t shine.  Got it?  …  Excellent.  Wait, wait.  Under 15 minutes or the pizza’s free, right?  … Good…  A man’s gotta eat…  God damn…

OPHELIA	Whatta ya doing with my Nature’s Mating Habit’s notebook?

JAMES	Oh, I was, ya know, just browsing through it.  Earmarking a couple of pages, some positions I thought we’d, ah, give the old college try.  C’mon…

OPHELIA	When are ya going to clean this place up?  You’re the senior resident whether you like it or not.

JAMES	Yeah, I know, I know.

OPHELIA	We’re supposed to be role models.

JAMES	I know, I know.  Right now, I’m having a power struggle with the maid, so what am I gonna do?

OPHELIA	James…

JAMES	(very light laugh)

Ophelia	… grow up.  This might have been funny when you were a freshman, but that was 6 years ago.  God, you’d think you’d have some respect for the place you’re determined to live in the rest of your life.

JAMES	Yeah, you’d think so, wouldn’t ya?

OPHELIA	(sigh sound)  So, seriously, this is the plan?  …  Are you ever going to graduate?!

JAMES	What and… get… a job?

OPHELIA	(frustrated sound)

JAMES	Ow!  Ophelia… ‘ay…   Ophelia…  Look baby, don’t hate the player, hate the game, okay?

OPHELIA	I used to love the player…

JAMES	Mm… mm…

LISA	Okay, up a little bit…  Left…  Right there.  Perfect…  Thank you so much for your help, Jose.

JOSE	Well, if you need anything else, you know where to find me.

LISA	Actually, there’s one more frame…  The most important one.  Can you put this one by my bed?

JOSE	Yeah…  True love waits?

LISA	It’s my pledge.  I’m saving myself for marriage.

JOSE	(sigh sound)

LISA	Too many people are just giving themselves away without any commitment.  Sex without love is meaningless…  When I find Mr. Right, I’ll know…  Right there.

JOSE	If you say so…

LISA	You really make me feel like I can make a go of this, stay here in college, in this house, even.

JOSE	Mm…

JOSE	I’m sorry.

LISA	I’m outta here.

GUYS	Sir!  Yes, Sir!!

CHIP	An Alpha Beta man, strong in mind and body…  Eyes front!

CHIP	An Alpha Beta man, has supreme self control…  and, an Alpha Beta man can resist all temptations…

JOSE	You sure about this?

LISA	I saw a flyer at the Church For The Sisterhood of the Immaculate Conception near campus.  I’m sure they’ll have a, room for me.

JOSE	But those chicks are crazy.  I heard they wear chastity belts for Christ’s sake.

LISA	You…  you’re so funny…

JOSE	So, well, if you ever change your mind, I’ll make sure they don’t give your room away…

LISA	I hope to see you around.

JOSE	Yeah, me, too…  Bye…

LISA	Bye…

JOSE	… What?  …  Big Jose, whatta ya doing here?

BIG JOSE	Checkin’ up on you, little Jose.  See how you’re livin’.

JOSE	Well, not too bad…

BIG JOSE	Man.  This place is a dump.

JOSE	Well, the dorm’s are full.  Where else am I gonna go?

BIG JOSE	I gotcha back, bro…

KAREN	Damn, pervert…  Oh, Killer, did you find yourself a home, right there?  … Well, you save your strength…  Oh, it is on…

SISTER (O.C.)	come.

LISA	(clears throat)  Your Holiness.

SISTER	Sister Sara will suffice.

LISA	(nervous)  Okay.  Is there somewhere, I should sit?

SISTER	We don’t believe in the comforts of the modern world.

LISA	Oh, but… you have a chair.

SISTER	Ah… pennants.

LISA	Oh.  I’m good.  I’ll stand.

SISTER	So, you want to join the Sisterhood of the Immaculate Conception.

LISA	Join?  Oh, yeah, maybe.  I don’t know.  I was just kinda seeing if you had a room for me.

SISTER	Are you willing to forgo temptation, physical pleasure, the sins of the flesh?

LISA	Oh, I believe true love waits.

SISTER	Do you, now?

LISA	I made a pledge to save myself for marriage.

SISTER	And you believe that no matter what you will keep that pledge?

LISA	I think so.  I hope so.

SISTER	We’ll see, won’t we…  Ahh…  College life is full of entanglements (??), tests for our moral fortitude.

LISA	I’m here to study, Sister.  To learn, to graduate, to get a good job.  That’s all I care about.

SISTER	The path to hell is littered with good intentions.

LISA	Oh…  Whoa…  Um, what’s going on?

SISTER	Our Lord survived 40 days and 40 nights of temptation.

LISDA	I have to stay here 40 days and nights?

SISTER	No, no, no, no.  40 minutes.

LISA	Oh, okay.  No problem…

HUNK	Your first time?  It’s okay.  I’ll take good care of you…

LISA	(breath sounds, light moaning) …  I’m sorry.  I can’t do this.  (breath sounds – continuous)  No…  I’m sorry…  Oh, no…

SISTER	Congratulations, Lisa.  Welcome to the Sisterhood of the Immaculate Conception.

LISA	True love waits, but it doesn’t wait forever.  Whaen I meet the man of my dreams, I’m gonna screw his brains out…

CHIP	Enough!  Now it’s time… for the tunnel of death.

CHIP	That’s just wrong.

CHIP	Get him out.  Now…  And the legacy lives on.

FREDDY	So, I’m in?

CHIP	Mm, one more challenge.

FREDDY	I’m not fuckin’ a hamster.

CHIP	She’s not into you, and, um, from what I hear, neither is that roommate of yours.

FREDDY	Karen?  Ah, she’s just playin’ hard to get.  Very fuckin’ hard to get.  

CHIP	Mm.  And, ah, if you’d like to be an Alpha Beta, maybe you could just prove yourself to me, show me, just, how you might make that happen.

FREDDY	So, I gotta bank the ice princess?

CHIP	And I’ll be watching.

JOSE	Idiot.  Idiot.  Idiot.

JAMES	Dude, what’re ya doin’?  That ain’t gonna do no good.

JOSE	I know.

JAMES	No, you don’t understand.  You gotta take it runnin’…  Ow!!

BIG JOSE	Hey, pack your stuff.  I got ya a new crib.

JOSE	Big Jose…  What have you done?

BIG JOSE	What>  It’s all good.  I haven’t fucked ‘em up.  Not yet.

JOSE	Who are they?

BIG JOSE	They’re frat prisoners, waitin’ for you to join…

JOSE	Look, bro, I appreciate it, but, this place ain’t so bad.

BIG JOSE	You’re shittin’ me, right?

JOSE	I’m gonna stay…  in case…

BIG JOSE	In case, what?

JOSE	… In case she comes back.

BIG JOSE	(in Spanish)  My brother is loco.  (??)

JOSE	You’re probably right.  So…

BIG JOSE	(pronounced…)  Hey-sez  says, what’s up?  (I think, maybe ‘sister.’)

JOSE	Tell her I’m doin’ good.

BIG JOSE	And give Mama a call too.  She misses you.  I miss you, too…  Gotta take these guys back before they press charges.

FREDDY	Man, I don’t think I can go through with this, man.

CHIP	An Alpha Beta man does not doubt himself.  And Alpha Beta man…

FREDDY	Fuck over his friends?

CHIP	If that’s what it takes.  Karen is the only thing standing between you and a life of privilege in the Alpha Beta House.  Are you gonna let a woman come between you and your destiny? … I didn’t think so.  Let’s go.

IN BEDROOM

KAREN	It’s make your mind up, Freddy.

FREDDY	Shh…  Be quiet.

KAREN	Can I help you with something?

FREDDY	Ahh…

KAREN	Spit it out, Freddy.

FREDDY	(whisper)  I want you to kick me out of your room.

KAREN	Really?

FREDDY	(whispers)  Yeah.  I’ll explain later.

CHIP	Now that’s an Alpha Beta man.

KAREN	(yelling)  Killer, sick balls…

CHIP	(painful sounds)  Ow… (etc.)

FREDDY	I’m sorry, alright?  He made me do it.

KAREN	Sure he did, Freddy.  What’s with all the excuses?  Don’t you have a mind of your own?  …

FREDDY	So, ah, ya wanna finish off where we left off?

KAREN	Killer!

FREDDY	Whoa, whoa, nice dog.  Oh, hey, Oh… no…

JAMES	Oh, I missed that nice sweet ass…  Mm…

OPHELIA	You coulda been here all day.  

JAMES	Yeah, I was takin’ care of my sheep.  I’m no part0timer, baby.  I give, give, give ‘til it hurts.

OPHELIA	You think you could give, give, give it to me?

JAMES	Oh, babe, you know me.  I’m the Mother Theresa of house booty calls.

OPHELIA	(very light laugh)

JAMES	Mm.  When there’s an ass that need tapping, I’ll be there.

JAMES	Mm… mm… Oh god…  ah, ah… Why did I ever break up with you?  (breath sounds)

OPHELIA	Mm…  Because you’re an asshole.

JAMES	You sure?

OPHELIA	Mm.  You have the emotional intelligence of a sheep.  (??)

JAMES	Mm, mm…

OPHELIA	You’re genetically incapable of being faithful.

JAMES	Mm, mm…  (moaning – continuous)

OPHELIA	(moaning, etc. – continuous)

LISA	You fixed it.

JOSE	In case you came back.

LISA	Well, I’m back…  To stay.  (light laughing)

JOSE	What, what happened?  What changed your mind?

LISA	I think true love is worth waiting for.

JOSE	And…?

LISA	And, I’m staying right here…  Mm…  You won’t believe the experience I had.

JOSE	What happened?

LISA	Oh my god.  I’ll tell you…

JOSE	Yeah…

OPHELIA	I’m not kidding.  You smell.

JAMES	C’mon, Ophelia, it’s pheromones, okay?  You’ve studied sex in the animal kingdom.  You should know.

OPHELIA	Yeah, I study sex in the animal kingdom.  Doesn’t mean I want to have sex with the animal kingdom.

JAMES	Look, this is my lucky T shirt, okay?  I have to wear it everyday, for the first week of the new semester.  That’s just how it goes.

OPHELIA	well, what happens if you don’t?

JAMES	Armageddon.

OPHELIA	I hated that movie as much as you did, but that T shirt’s not gonna stop Michael Bay.

JAMES	(very light laugh)  Someone’s gotta try.

OPHELIA	No, ya know what, you’re coming with me.

JAMES	Ophelia… no… hey…

OPHELIA	Now.  C’mon…

JAMES	No.  Okay, what’re you doing?  No, I’m not…

OPHELIA	Get in.

JAMES	I’m not getting in there.  I’m not getting in there.  That’s it.

OPHELIA	Okay.  Your loss.

JAMES	Whatta ya mean, my loss?  Le, look.  No.  You won’t convince me…  Ophelia…

OPHELIA	Mm?  …  See, it doesn’t hurt, does it?

JAMES	No, it doesn’t, like it hurts…

OPHELIA	Get in…

JAMES	Mm.  I’m not getting the shirt wet.  Don’t, ah, don’t, ah, mess up my shirt, okay?  …

OPHELIA	Try a little bit of water.

JAMES	Okay…  (very light laugh)

OPHELIA	(very light laugh)

JAMES	Done…  Mm…  You’re crazy…  No, no.  It’s staying on.

OPHELIA	It’s on.

JAMES	Okay…

OPHELIA	Good boy.  See, it wasn’t too hard, was it?

JAMES	No…  Oh god…  It’s supposed to have a scent.  A special scent.

OPHELIA	I’ll give it a better scent.

JAMES	Oh, god…


JAMES	Okay, okay, okay… I’m coming.  I’m coming… 
JAMES	Ooh… yeah…

MIA	Fuck it!  Mm… 

JOSE	What’re you doing?

MIA	What does it look like I’m doing?

JOSE	Breaking into a car.

MIA	Wow, you must be a straight A student.

JOSE	Why are you breaking into someone’s car?

MIA	Not somebody’s.  Mine.  I locked my keys inside.  I do it all the time.

JOSE	You have a spare?

MIA	Yeah.

JOSE	Okay, where is it?

MIA	In the car…  So, could ya help a girl out?

JOSE	Mm.  Watch and learn…  My brother’s taught me that before I could even walk.

MIA	Cool.  They teach yo how to hot wire, too?

JOSE	Hotwire?  But I thought you side…

MIA	Oh, fuck!

JANE	Whatta we have here?

JOSE	I was helping this girl out, to get into her car.  She locked her keys inside.

JANE	Oh.  Where are they?

MIA	I don’t know.

JANE	I thought you just said this was your car.

MIA	I didn’t.  He did.

JOSE	What?!

MIA	I don’t even know him…

JOSE	Wait, Officer.  Officer…

MIA	I was just minding my own business and he came by and he broke into this car.

JANE	Uh huh…

MIA	Thank you, Officer, for keeping the campus safe for us law abiding students.

JOSE	You’re kiddin?

MIA	I, what the fuck?!

JANE	I’m calling this in.  Stay put.

MIA	(hyper-ventilating)  

JOSE	(whisper)  What?

JANE	What’s wrong?

MIA	My, my asthma, my inhaler.  In my purse…

JANE	Where is it?  

JANE	Aw, shit…  Not again.

KAREN	(light laughing)


KAREN	Oh my god…  (etc.)

LISA	Are you… okay.

KAREN	I’m better than okay.

LISA	Okay.  I’ll, ah, I’ll come back.

KAREN	It’s fine, Lisa.  It’s natural.  In fact, I really think you should rub one out, sometimes.

LISA	Excuse me?

KAREN	It’s a great stress reliever.  It’s like yoga, except without the mat.

LISA	He could put someone’s eye out with that.

KAREN	So what’s up, Lisa?

LISA	It’s Jose.  We were supposed to study together for a history test, but, he never came back home.

KAREN	Well, maybe he just forgot.

LISA	No, Professor Chase has really been on our case.  Jose was supposed to grab some books from the library and then, he’d be home.

KAREN	Maybe, he got lucky and squirted some chick at the library or maybe he’s having mind-blowing sex with the librarian, right now.

LISA	They’re all in their 80’s.

KAREN	Maybe he’s into a little ‘who’s your granny.   (laughs)  Okay, okay, I’m joking.  I’ll call campus security.  Hopefully, they’ll send over a cute cop this time…

JOSE	So who’s car was it that you were breaking into?

MIA	My ex’s.

JOSE	You tried to get back at him?

MIA	He has photos of me…  naked, doing things.

JOSE	What kind of things?

MIA	You know.  Things.

MIA	Things that aren’t even legal in this state.  Things that’ll make your head spin, your toes curl and your cock as hard as concrete marble. Let’s just say they involve a fist, 3 lemons, half a quart of axel grease and a popular game show host, who I say shall remain nameless, for legal reasons.  So, where we goin’?

JOSE	My place.  Maybe James has bull cutters.

KAREN	That’ll be security.

LISA	(softly)  Great…

KAREN	Well, hello.

JOHNSON	Hi.  I’m officer Johnson, campus security.

KAREN	Yes, yes you are.  I’ve seen you around here before.

JOHNSON	I’ve seen you around, too.

KAREN	Yeah.  So, ah, what does it take for a girl to get arrested around here?

LISA	It’s about our housemate, Jose.  He never made it home, last night.

FREDDY	That’s ‘cause he’s a stone cold killer.  (imitating Hannibal Lector)  I seen him with his fava beans and his Chianti.  (sucking sound)

JOHNSON	I could arrest you right now.

FREDDY	Why, ‘cause I’m black?

JOHNSON	‘Cause you’re a walking obscenity.

FREDDY	Aw, mother-fucker James, man.

LISA	Jose!

JOHNSON	Mia, isn’t this exactly the kind of stunt I warned you about?

MIA	You said you find it endearing.

JOHNSON	You guys aren’t going anywhere.

FREDDY	Stop him before he kills again!

LISA	Hey!

FREDDY	What?  Robo-cop ain’t gonna do anything.  He ain’t got the balls to do nothing.

ALL	(scream)

FREDDY	That’s sweet.

JOSE	… What the hell!

MIA	Man, rent-a-cop lost the keys to the cuffs, so I’ve been chained to you the whole time you were sleepin’.

JOSE	I wasn’t sleeping.  I got stun-gunned.  And all because of you.

MIA	Oh, ah, yeah, I know.  And I feel real terrible about that.

JOSE	No you don’t.  You’re nothing but trouble.

MIA	You don’t know the half of it.  My ex boyfriend, he used to tell me that I reminded him of a demon summoned from the gates of hell.

JOSE	He sounds delightful.

MIA	Mm, it’s just the ‘roids’ talking.

JOSE	Steroids?  

MIA	They tend to make him a tid bit violent.

JOSE	That’s great.  Just great!  I’m chained to the Incredible Hulk’s girlfriend.

MIA	No, he’s away.  Well… he was away.  He gets back in town, today.  He, he was only at a convention.

JOSE	Please tell me it was a Star Trek convention.

MIA	Oh, Harley.  He’s a biker.	

JOSE	And the hits keep coming…

LISA	He’ll lose his scholarship and then he’ll have to leave school.

KAREN	And you!  I can’t believe you did that to Jose.

FREDDY	Did what?

KAREN	Got the hot cop to use the stun-gun.

FREDDY	Officer Johnson’s a real…

KAREN/OPHELIA	Piece of ass.

OPHELIA	Ahh… (laughs)

KAREN	(laughing)  …  What?  He is.

OPHELIA	For a cop he is.

FREDDY	Wait, wait, wait.  Have you forgot about Jane?

OPHELIA	They’re not together, anymore.  I can say what I like.

LISA	Okay, you guys, could we focus?  Jose’s in jail.

FREDDY	That’s what ya get for messin’ with the law.

KAREN	If he gets kicked out, who’s gonna write your term paper?

FREDDY	Shit, we need to get him outta there.

KAREN	We gotta spring ‘em.  You know, bust ‘em outta jail.

LISA	This isn’t Alcatraz.  I mean, he’s not going to the big house.  (light laugh)  …  Right?

FREDDY	Jail break.

KAREN	I gotta do something.  I’ll play your bitch.

JOSE	Huh, huh.  How could you think about that in a place like this?

MIA	I don’t know if it’s the cuffs.  They bring back some memories.  Fuck, they bring back a lot of memories…  Mm…  Mm… ooh.  Ya know what?  There’s something I forgot to tell you.  Um, my ex, he doesn’t exactly know he’s my ex…  I, haven’t exactly told him, yet.

JOSE	What, what are you doing?  Your boyfriend’s the Terminator.  Remember?

MIA	No, but, he’s not here…


MIA	(moaning, yeah’s, etc. – continuous)

KAREN	Officer Johnson.

JOHNSON	Karen.

KAREN	I just wanted to thank you for coming by the house…  You’re so brave and I’ve been thinking about what I could possibly do to thank you, for all your help.

JOHNSON	That’s okay.  I was just doing my job.

KAREN	Really?  ‘Cause I thought of the perfect way.

JOHNSON	Yeah, and what’s that?

KAREN	Mm…

JOHNSON	Ah, listen, I’m, I’m on duty.

KAREN	I love it when you use police talk on me.  (very light laugh)  …

JOHNSON	(light laughing)  

KAREN	Ya know what I like better than a man in uniform, is a man out of uniform.  (laughs)  …  Gosh, they should call you Chief Johnson.

JOHNSON	(light laugh)

KAREN	(moaning – etc. – continuous)

JOHNSON	(eventual moaning – continuous)


FREDDY	(laughs)  Oh, this place is awesome.  I’ll go to jail.

LISA	Shut up, this is a prison break…  Okay, put something on.  We haven’t got long.  Karen’s buying us some time…  C’mon…

FREDDY	Alright.

JOSE	So, kinda like getting a divorce, huh?

MIA	It was fun while it lasted.

JOSE	Thanks guys.  Thank you.  I owe you big time.

LISA	Oh, don’t thank us.  Thank Karen.

FREDDY	Yeah, she’s takin’ one for the team…  Poor girl.  (very light laugh)

JOSE	Let’s just go.  C’mon.

MIA	There’s somethin’ I have to tell you about my boyfriend.

JOSE	Let me guess.  He’s a cannibal?  He had 90 confirmed kills in Desert Storm?

MIA	Nooo, that’s not it.

JOSE	Then what?

MIA	He’s over there.

JOSE	Oh!  Fuck!

MIA	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh…  This is, this isn’t what it looks like.

JOSE	That’s right, man.

MIA	We’re in love.  Yeah.  It’s over between us.  I realized that last night when Jose was fuckin’ me like I’ve never been fucked before.

JOSE	She’s lying.

MIA	He did it to me with his cock which you couldn’t even imagine.

JOSE	Mia, please, stop!!

MIA	I came for the very first time, last night.

JOSE	That’s not true, man.  You did?

MIA	Yeah.

JOSE	Really?

MIA	Oh!

BOYFRIEND	I’m gonna break you in half, you little fucker.

JANE	Put him down.

MIA	Ah, not again.

JANE	Isn’t this enough trouble for one day?

JOSE	I’m sorry.  It was just…

LISA	We’ll take him home…

FREDDY	Hey, no hard feelings about the stun-gunning, right?  … Dude, it was just a joke.

JOSE	Well, payback’s a bitch, dude…  Hey.

LISA	Hey.  So, what happened?

JOSE	Long story…  Look, I know, when you came to this house, it looked like…

LISA	… Jose.  You’re a single guy.  You can do what you want.

JOSE	Yeah, but, I thought I was going to jail.  I thought the closet I’d come to sex would be, dropping the soap in the shower, ya know?…

LISA	… (light laugh)  Well, it’s over, now.  I’m just glad you’re home…

JOSE	So, you still wanna study?

LISA	I think I’m going to study alone…  I…  Never mind…

JOSE	Lisa.

MIA	We got rights, don’t we?  We demand 3 lemons and a quart of axel grease.
