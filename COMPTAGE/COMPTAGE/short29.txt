THOMAS	Not long ago, we had a Great Railway show. Engines from all around the world came to the Mainland to compete…

THOMAS	…I made some really good friends…

THOMAS	...but afterwards, they all had to go home.  And right now, they are all traveling back. 

THOMAS	I wonder where they are now.

STORYTELLER	Great Race Friends Near and Far. 

STORYTELLER	Raul had travelled for a long time to get home... But now he was finally back in Brazil.

STORYTELLER	Raul loved the rainforests. He loved seeing all the trees and hearing the call of the birds.

STORYTELLER	But most of all, Raul loved to see the Brazil Nut trees. 

STORYTELLER	Brazil Nut trees grow to be very old... 

STORYTELLER	They grow very tall and they produce a delicious nut.

STORYTELLER	Raul was very happy to be home!

STORYTELLER	But when Raul arrived at the station he met some very unhappy holiday makers. 'What's the matter?' Raul Asked. 'We've come to Brazil to see all the monkeys in the rainforest, but so far we haven't seen one!' Said one of the holiday makers.

STORYTELLER	'I bet I can show you lots of monkeys,' said Raul. 'Jump on board!' So the holiday makers climbed into Raul's carriages.

STORYTELLER	Raul puffed slowly through the rainforests. But the holiday makers still couldn't see any monkeys. 'I need to find some monkeys for the holiday makers! But they all seem to be hiding!'

STORYTELLER	Then Raul saw the Brazil Nut tree.

STORYTELLER	And when he saw a Brazil Nut fall from the tree he had an idea! 'Everyone! Come and see this tree!' 

STORYTELLER	'It's a very nice tree,but there aren't any monkeys in it!' 'We wanted to see some monkeys!' 

STORYTELLER	'And you will, gather up all the nuts that fall off this tree and put them in by back truck!'

STORYTELLER	So the holiday makers gathered up all the Brazil Nuts they could find. And they put them into Raul's truck...

STORYTELLER	Raul puffed slowly through the rainforests.

STORYTELLER	And it wasn't long before the monkeys spotted the Brazil Nuts.

STORYTELLER	Soon, Raul's truck was full of little monkeys eating the nuts.

STORYTELLER	Raul stopped so that the holiday makers could all get pictures of the monkeys. 'Thank you Raul!' Cheered the holiday makers. 'Don't thank me! Just thank the Brazil Nut tree...'  

THOMAS	I hope all my friends are having a fun journey, and I hope I see them again one day.
