(PHILIP TO THE RESCUE)


THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...Not showing-off.

THOMAS	James is a very proud engine. He likes to tell everyone he's the best at everything.

THOMAS	One day at the Shunting Yard, Philip told James and I how strong he was, and how he could pull lots of cargo. 

THOMAS	Instead of ignoring Philip, James decided to also be a show off and prove that he was the stronger engine.  

THOMAS	But then there was trouble...

THOMAS	The heavy cargo was too much for James and it pushed him off the tracks and over the edge of the bridge....

THOMAS	Luckily, Philip was on hand to save him! 

THOMAS	James realised he shouldn't have tried to pull more cargo than he could manage. Showing-off didn't made James look strong or clever.

THOMAS	That's why showing-off is never a good idea.
