(RISE OF THE FOOTSOLDIER 2)




NARRATOR	I WANT TO DIE WITH DIGNITY. BUT WHEN EXECUTION IS CARRIED OUT IN MY WORLD, THERE’S NO MILITARY PARADE. NO MUSIC. NO MARCH PAST. IT’S JUST A HIDEOUS DEATH. NO GUILT. AND NO REMORSE. THAT’S THE WAY IT’S ALWAYS BEEN. BUT NOW THAT I’VE GOT DEATH STARING ME IN THE FACE, WHY SHOULD I ACCEPT? I KNEW THAT WHOEVER KILLED TONY AND THE LADS COULD STILL BE OUT THERE. AND WITH EVERY DAY THAT WENT BY THE ANGER AND THE FRUSTRATION GOT WORSE... UNTIL I FELT THE PARANOIA SLOWLY SUFFOCATING ME. ESSEX HAD CHANGED, BECOME DARKER. THE PILL POPPING ACID HOUSE DAYS WERE LONG GONE. COKE HAD TAKEN OVER.  SOME NIGHTS I COULD SMELL THE CRACK SEEPING OUT THE PORES OF THEIR SKIN.

Carlton Leach	Where’s the fucking gear?

Female Clubber	They said he sorted you out a couple of packets already.

Carlton Leach	Yeah. That’s right. I’ve taxed your fellow, now I’m taxing you. Where’s the fucking gear?

Carlton Leach	I’ll sort it. Just fuck off to bed. Fuck off.  

Denny	I'm sick of this shit. I’m bored of your bollocks. For fucks sake, Carlton. You’re disgusting.

New reader on TV	... very different to what happened in Luton last year when Margaret Moran went on extended sick leave for a complaint the town had made representation. David [INAUDIBLE] was once highly regarded within his party. It wants to see him back at Westminster. It’s trying to do what it can to help ...  A husband and wife ... Gangland slaying ... Discovered in a Range Rover on a farm in Rettendon in E ... It’s expected that the names of those murdered will be released. 

Unseen female child	Mum. Mum. Dad. Dad. There’s someone out there. Please. Please someone help us. Please mum. 

Denny	You're fucking sick! I'm not putting up with this shit anymore. You're fucking sick. Come on girls.  I'm taking the girls. We’re going to my moms and if you come fucking near me I’m gonna call the old bill. Do you hear me? Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go.  Go. Go. Go. 

Shawn 	Alright mate, fucking hell. 

Carly's friend	So he comes in all guns blazing. Drags her out of bed. Did you see the state of her face?

Carly	No. 

Carly’s friend	Great big black eye. I mean she was trying to cover it with makeup, but it looks horrendous. She might as well just left it.

Shawn	Yeah, get her come down here. I’m pissing and after that I’ll fucking shit on her head.

Carlton Leach 	Alright girls. Bloody hell he’s getting big isn’t he Ton?

Shawn	I’ll shit in your mouth.

Carlton Leach	Been here long?

Carly’s friend	No just got here.

Shawn	Oh fuck off.

Carly	It’s alright dad, you can sit down. You alright Shawn.

Shaw	Well you better buy her a new one. Alright. 

Carlton Leach	You ordered?

Carly	No not yet. 

Carlton Leach	You heard from mum?

Carly	Yeah she phoned me this morning.

Carlton Leach	And what did she have to say?

Carly	She said you're a fucking mug.

Carlton Leach	Oh really? That’s nice isn’t it? 

Shawn	No, shut up. Listen. Look you know how this works. Oh fuck off. 

Denny 	Have whatever you want. Does your little one want something?  Here you do children’s meals don't you fellow?

Carly’s friend	He’s already had something thanks. Otherwise he’ll be shitting everywhere. 

Carly	Are you having something dad?

Carlton Leach 	No. No I’m not hungry. Listen I’ll just have a Jack Daniels and Coke please fellow, lots of ice. You wanna drink?

Carly	Uh diet coke. 

Carlton Leach	Alright so that’s two diet cokes please fellow and he’ll have a cup of tea.

Shawn	He’s owes us! Fuck off! 

Carlton Leach	When you gonna make me a granddad?

Shawn	Oh fuck off. 

Carlton Leach	Problem?

Shawn	Benny wants to know if you want [INAUDIBLE].

Carly	I gotta find a nice bloke first. 

Carlton Leach	There’s loads of nice blokes in Essex. What’s he want?

Shawn	Saab 900 don't belong to George, belongs to Benny’s misses. She’s screwing Benny, wants it back today.

Carlton Leach	That’s not my problem. 

Shawn	That’s Benny now. Hello. Calm down. He wants to speak to you.

Carlton Leach	Hello, Benny. Alright listen, don't shout. No. No. Don't ... Benny, don't shout. Listen. Listen that fucking George has been swerving me for the last two weeks. Look I don't care if it’s your wife’s motor, or mother fucking Theresa’s, I’m owed money, so I’ve taken it. Look w ... She wants it back today you're gonna have to front and go and see George for it. That’s not my problem. No li ... Take that. He’s giving me a fucking headache. What was we saying? Oh yeah why can't you get a bloke?

Carly	Because the very minute they find out who my dad is they suddenly lose interest. It’s funny that, isn’t it?

Shawn	No he fucking owes us. If the money ain’t there tonight, right. George is going in the boot and the motor is going in the Thames. 

Carly	Look can we just have a few more minutes.

Carlton Leach	I don't know what he cunts problem is. He comes to us right with a bit of a fucking wow that can't be sorted out in court, right. We’ve done the work. I mean what does he want a fucking invoice. 

Shawn	I know people  take fucking liberties. 

Carlton Leach	And what’s George going riding a fucking benny white anyway, over a poxy three grand fucking debt. 

Shawn	I know he’s giving me the right fucking hump. 

Carlton Leach	Cunt. 

Carlton Leach	What’s the time?

Shawn	Bang on one. 

Carlton Leach	So how did we leave it? Benny coming?

Shawn	No he’s sending his nephew.

Dave	No. Just got bills to pay. 

Carlton Leach 	Haven’t we all fellow. Haven’t we all. So come on then, what’s happening? You find him or what?

Shawn	Yeah that's what I'm doing no one’s answering. 

Carlton Leach	How much would you give me for this motor Dave?

Dave	I can't afford it.

Carlton Leach	Well let’s just say ... that you could ... what? Four grand? Five grand? How about six grand? That sound about right to you? Yeah? 

Dave	Aye, it sounds about right. 

Carlton Leach	Aye. So if I was to offer you this motor right now, for about three grand, a mere three grand, you’d say I was being really generous wouldn't you?

Dave	Aye. 

Carlton Leach	So why the fuck are these cunts not fucking here!

Shawn	Carl I don't know what he’s playing at, alright. I’ve called him three fucking times. 

Carlton Leach	Bollocks! Fuck him. I’m not fucking having this.

Steve	The rota I’ve done it myself, Carl. Management stepped in. There’s been way too much agg.  They're giving me the door now. They've let you go. I’m sorry mate. 

Carlton Leach	What do you mean, what? What? What? What you've taken over or something?

Steve	Yeah. 

Carlton Leach	Jesus Christ, hang on a fucking minute. You wouldn't even be on the door if it weren’t for me. I fucking helped you out when you was on your fucking knees you cunt!

Thelma	Hello?

Carlton Leach	Hello Thelma. Is Denny there?

Thelma	Carlton. She’s gone out. 

Carlton Leach	Hello mate, you alright? Yeah listen, come and get me. I can't stay in here. I'm gonna go fucking mad.... if he thinks he can just mug us off... and no one no one throws me a fucking bone ... Unknown Male in Hospital Oh I thought we lost you Carlton, but you're ... you're coming back now. When you boys fall it is ... that you come ... Cocaine and [UNSURE OF WORD] hypothermia.  A result, I'm afraid Carlton of ... excess.

Reg	Geezer you're after has jumped out the toilet window. You be quick, you might catch him. Good to see you mate. How have you been?

Carlton Leach	Alright. 

Reg	I’ve been waiting for you to come and see me after what happened. It’s been a long time. 

Carlton Leach	I’ve been busy.

Reg	He was a good man, Charlie. They all were. But they took liberties. You did well to stay out of it. I hope their families get justice.  How is yours?

Carlton Leach	Denny has moved out. 

Reg	Carlton. Do you know how many a soldier can spend in combat before he starts to crack up? 60. If they don't pull them out after that, 98 percent of them are ready for the loony bin. What’s happened to you Carlton?

Carlton Leach 	I'm alright. 

Reg	You're shaking fellow. You been living on the front line for too long son, and in our world, no one pulls you out. 

Carlton Leach 	Can you throw me some work?

Reg 	You’ll have to string yourself out. But they've been swerving you Carl, because you've become unpredictable. They're saying ... you're a liability son.  Here you are. Two bags there. Take it. Spend it on coke if you like. Or sort yourself out and get back in the gym. You step off the merry go round son. Tell me you got back on it. 

NARRATOR	WHEN THE UNDERWORLD THROWS YOU A LIFELINE YOU TAKE IT. I WASN’T PREPARED TO DIE. AND I WASN’T ABOUT TO THROW THE TOWEL IN EITHER. 

Carlton Leach	Fucking hell, don't know about Pikies. It’s alright fellow you can put that down, Reg sent us. 

Shawn	Mate, tell these cunts to stop banging. Where’s Geoff King, we wanna talk to him.

Russell	He’s in the office. Bit shaken up.

Carlton Leach	So is this the first time this has happened or what?

Russell	Yeah. He’s not had the place long. He’s a nice fellow but ... he hadn’t got a clue. 

Carlton Leach 	You don't say. 

Russell 	That’s why he brought me in, you know. Someone who knows the game and that. 

Russell	Follow me gents. 

Carlton Leach	Cunt.  Want a drink?

Shawn	Yeah, go on. 

Carlton Leach	Darling, can I get a couple of diet cokes please? Don't worry about the ice. 

Geoff King	They just kept kicking me. They're like bloody animals. They told this prat it was an anniversary. 

Carlton Leach	Who is they?

Russell	Two girls came in. They said it was their mum and dad’s 50th.

Carlton Leach	Did you get their names?

Russell	Tina was one, I don't know the other.

Shawn	What you didn’t get their details?

Geoff King	Did he fuck. 

Russell	I didn’t know they were Pikies.

Geoff King	It couldn’t have been more obvious if they'd tried to sell you lucky fucking heather. 

Shawn	They always send the women in first.

Russell	Well they seemed alright to me. I didn’t know that two hours later there’d be hundreds of them.

Shawn	Yeah. It was a wedding. 

Geoff King	The women were all at one end and the men were all stood at the other. 

Russell	Then the kids starting letting off the fire extinguishers. 

Carlton Leach	Yeah. It was a wedding. I’ve been to a couple. 

Russell	They were pulling their own pints. 

Geoff King	I tried to speak to them they just went berserk. 

Carlton Leach	Where was your door staff while all this was happening?

Geoff King	Being knocked unconscious. Two of them are now in hospital. 

Carlton Leach	What did the old bill say?

Geoff King	They said once they find a place they like they keep coming back. 

Shawn	Yeah they will. 

Geoff King	I can't go through this again. 

Carlton Leach	I’ll see what I can do. Excuse us. 

Shawn	What you thinking?

Carlton Leach	I think it’s a lot of vag; it’s a shithole. 

Shawn	It’s a big shit hole though. 

Carlton Leach	I’d knock that through. Turn the whole place into one big club. What do you think of him?

Shawn	He’s a mug.  He’s obviously got a lot of Doris’ working for him. 

Carlton Leach	It’s alright. Fuck them off. Bring in our own lumps. We can sort of their sag and take over the whole lot. He owns the freehold. And we own him. 
 
Shawn	I think we should swerve it. I mean I fucking hate clubs. And you're gonna get right back on the sniff. I collect bets, I don't run fucking doors do I. Plus it’s gonna take a load of our fucking time and ... what about the work?

Carlton Leach	Jesus I'm not asking you to give up kidnapping and torturing people. All I'm saying is if we set this up properly, it’ll take of itself. Mate, I’m on my fucking knees here, help me out. Just trying to get my family back. Listen we could sort out the bits and pieces. Make fucking bundles here, I'm telling you. Fucking bundles. 

Shawn	Nah, that’s what Pat and Tony thought. 

Carlton Leach	Yeah but things are different now aren’t they.

Shawn	Are they?

Carly	I bet there’s no food in the house. If it is it’s probably gone off. 

Carlton Leach	There's milk in the fridge. 

Carly	Who’s doing your washing?

Carlton Leach	Me. Who do you think is bloody doing it?

Carly	Bet you’ve taken it down the laundrette.

Carlton Leach	Listen. I might not be the greatest dad in the world, but I know how to wash my own bloody shorts girl. 

Carly	Do you want me to come over?

Carlton Leach	No! I'm alright. You seen the posters, my new club?

Carly	No you haven’t got a club. 

Carlton Leach	Yes I have.  Tell Denny, when you see her, alright, that I'm gonna be soon. Tell her I'm gonna be dripping with doe alright. Tell her that. 

Carly	And don't forget it’s Jody’s birthday next week.

Carlton Leach	When?

Carly	You're bloody outrageous dad.

Carlton Leach	I know when she was born, I just don't know what day it is next week. 

Carly	It’s next Sunday. 

Carlton Leach	Alright.  Well ... I’ll get her something nice. 

Geoff King	Listen. I know it’s opening night and everyone is a bit excited, but one of your doormen is out there, waving about what looks like a cattle prod. 

Shawn	Yeah, it’s mad Jack. I’ll tell him to put it away.

Jody	²Hello. 

Carlton Leach	Hello darling. So is your Nan making you a birthday cake?

Jody	Yeah.

Carlton Leach	You gonna save me some?

Carlton Leach	Yeah. Well I’ll have to speak to your mum first.

Jody	When are we gonna come home, dad? I don't wanna stay at Nana’s anymore. 

Denny	What did you say to her?

Carlton Leach	I didn’t say nothing to her.

Denny	Thanks for that. I’ve gotta try and get her to bed now. 

Carlton Leach	So what’s happening about tomorrow?

Denny	I don't know alright. I’ve got two kids screaming my mum’s house down right now. So I don't know anything.

Carlton Leach	For fuck’s sake. Cheers Lucy. 

Lucy	So what's she gonna say?

Carlton Leach	Who?

Lucy	Your wife when you go home?

Carlton Leach	Nothing. 

Lucy	So how long have you been together?

Carlton Leach	What’s it got to do with you

Lucy 	Last night you were piled up asking if you could stay here while you're getting your shit together. And what, I can't ask you a question now? Look if you think you're the only guy that I’ve fucked in this bed, you're even more stupid than your wife for putting up with your shit. I'm not actually. Because if I was I’d probably be dead by now. Don't worry I know when to keep my mouth shut. 

Carlton Leach	There’s a lump in my throat, now. 

Lucy	What’s that got to do with you?

Carlton Leach	Nothing.  Hello Thelma. 

Thelma	What do you want? Ain't you fucking dead yet?

Denny	What is it now Carlton? 

Carlton Leach	I just wanna come round and wish my daughter happy birthday, if it’s alright?

Denny	Look at the state of you. 

Carlton Leach	Yeah well we had a bit of rag at the club last night. 

Denny	I'm not interested. 

Denny	You coming in or what?

Jody	Dad.  

Carlton Leach	Happy birthday darling. 

Jody 	Oh. 

Carlton Leach	Alright. Alright don't drop him. 

Denny	What do you say to your dad?

Jody	Thank you.

Carlton Leach	Yeah. Do I get a kiss. There you go. Alright. 

Denny	That’ll be pissing everywhere. You don't like my mate’s dogs. 

Denny	You gonna take your coat off or what?

Carlton Leach	No. No I’ve gotta go. I’ve got a bit of work on. 

Denny	Of course you have. 

Carlton Leach	Look I want you and the kids to come back home. 

Denny	I told you Carl, I’m not doing it.

Carlton Leach	Yeah, well that’s what I wanted to talk to you about, you know. It’s just ... 

Denny	What?

Carlton Leach	Look can't we just go inside?

Denny	It’s hardly a fucking secret.

Carlton Leach	Alright. Well, I’m moving out. I don't think it’s fair that you and the girls are cooped up round here, you know.

Denny	Where are you going?

Carlton Leach	I’ll probably stay with a friend.

Denny	Right. Right. Well thanks for stopping by yeah.

Carlton Leach	Take this. 

Denny	Thanks.

Demikran	Abass you remember Carlton, he used to be a very close friend of the family. Before the troubles. No. You're too young.

Carlton Leach	How’s the rest of the family? 

Demikran	Busy as always. 

Carlton Leach	That’s good to hear.  Are you sure you don't want a drink son?

Demikran	No. No. No. No. He’s a good. Bit like his father. 

Carlton Leach	So you still like to gamble?

Demikran	You know win some, lose some. 

Carlton Leach	What about lately?

Demikran	Lose some. 

Carlton Leach	How much?

Demikran	Two trucks. One has been stripped. Gone.  The other one is sitting in a barn somewhere in Kent.  Done by the same people.

Carlton Leach	Yeah it’s been happening a lot recently. 

Shawn	That’s a little bit naughty to hijack a truck that’s already been stolen. 

Demikran	Well we live in dark times my friend. 

Carlton Leach	Booze or fags?

Demikran	Vodka. Courtesy of France. 

Shawn	What about the driver?

Demikran	He put up a fight, but they stabbed him. We think he’s dead. The other guy got away. Lucky. Because that’s why we know where the truck is. We need someone to reclaim it. 

Shawn	What do you think? 

Carlton Leach	I think we should go and get it. 

Mad Jack	I was humping the Misses last night and after about six minutes, I shoot my load, roll over, spark up. She starts going all fucking Garrety, ain’t you gonna finish me off you selfish bastard? So I smothered her.

Kev	You are joking?

Mad Jack	Nah. 

Felix	Did you have to bring him?

Mad Jack	What? Oh it’s alright. She’s still alive, the fat bitch. [LAUGH]. 

Felix	Listen you, shut your fucking mouth and stay away from me.

Mad Jack	Don't be giving me no fucking orders Sweaty. [LAUGH]. You ain’t in the army now. What the fuck you doing here anyway?

Felix	I’m here to drive the fucking wagon.

Demikran	He won't be working for us again, but he’ll live. Nice work Carlton, thank you. Might have another job if you're interested.

Carlton Leach	I'm listening. 

Demikran	You'll need your passports. 

Carlton Leach	Go on.

Demikran	How does Tenerife sound?

Carlton Leach	Lovely. 

Demikran	... when people pay their taxes, everyone’s happy. When certain individuals choose to ignore that ... we have a problem. 

Shawn	Well it’s simple. If people wanna serve up then they gotta pay. So we can take care of that for you. 

Carlton Leach	Why not. You’ll have to excuse me for a minute gents. 

Demikran	Do you Tenerife?

Shawn	Well to be honest, it’s not really my cup of tea, but Carlton’s done some work out there with Tony when Nigel Benn was training for a fight. So, you know, why not.

Demikran	Good. 

Lucy	Fucking hell you on Viagra or something?

Mad Jack	Yeah. He’s probably right. 

Shawn	They're sniffing their heads off in there. You get hold of her?

Carlton Leach	She’s not answering her phone. 

Carlton Leach	Mate, me and him had such a laugh out here. We were side by side. We just knew we had each other’s back. We was untouchable. It should have stayed like that.

Shawn	Wasn’t your fault mate. 

Carlton Leach	And now I’m doing exactly the same with Denny and the kids. I'm gonna lose them Shawn.

Shawn	No you'll sort it mate. 

Carlton Leach	You reckon?

Shawn	Yeah, ‘course. 

Carlton Leach	You know I'm always gonna be there for you don't you?

Shawn	Yeah I know mate. 

Carlton Leach	Come on. Let’s go and see if that mad cunt has had heart attack. 

Stan	How is things going with Mickey Steel and Jack?

Carlton Leach	They're still waiting their trial aren’t they?

Stan	Do you think they did it?

Carlton Leach	Doesn’t matter what I think, it ain’t gonna bring Tony back. 

Stan	What if they didn’t do it?

Carlton Leach	Then whoever did is still walking about. 

Bob	That’s why I ain’t coming back bruv. The Ends is a shit hole, you could get popped by anyone. If the Yardys ain't trying to boss you, the Nortons will. I'm telling you, I'm not going back to Essex until it fucking calms down with bass. 

Shawn	Well you'll be waiting a long time then won't you. Essex will never calm down, there’s too many people at it.

Carlton Leach	Which is fine. As long as you don't take the piss. 

Carlton Leach	It’s good to see you big fellow.

Bob	You too man.

Stan	ARight. Well we better go and check on the door. Lads, soon as you're ready, come down. We’ll look after you. 

Shawn	I reckon that’s them. 

Carlton Leach	Yeah, mate your right. 

Mad Jack	Boys. It’s cunt o'clock. Let’s go. 

Carlton Leach	Evening gents. Who you paying rent to? Who the fuck are you? My name is Carlton Leach, now answer the question. Young man in Club We pay the club. You see the thing is, the owner of this club is a very good friend of mine. And he begs to differ.  Come with me. It’s alright, I ain’t gonna hurt you. Just wanna talk business. These men belong to us From now on you pay Demikran do you understand?? Oy oy.

Carly	Oh my god. How muggy is that. Right come on. We’re going.  Dad don't forget to speak to Denny because she misses you alright.

Carlton Leach	Yeah, whatever. 

Cash/Carry owner	We don't have that sort of money. We just have a small cash and carry business.

Carlton Leach	Well they obviously think you do.

Cash/Carry owner’s father	We don't have £100,000.

Shawn	Sit down fellow you're giving me indigestion.

Cash/Carry owner	Father please sit down. These men are gonna help. 

Shawn	I'm not so sure about that fellow. Who are these people? 

Carlton Leach	I don't know. 

Cash/Carry owner	His name is Matthew Taylor. 

Shawn	Matthew Taylor, who the fuck is that? Do you know?

Carlton Leach	No.

Shawn	Great so you want me to look through the fucking yellow pages. 

Cash/Carry owner	If we don't give him a 100K by Wednesday.

Carlton Leach	Yeah he’s gonna burn the warehouse down. I’ve got that bit.

Shawn	Look. 

Carlton Leach	They're just a couple of mugs, ain’t they, trying it on. 

Shawn	Are you sure about that?

Carlton Leach	Well what do you think?

Shawn	I don't know, this came through you didn’t it. 

Carlton Leach	Alright. 40 grand. 

Cash and Carry owner	We can't pay that. 

Carlton Leach	Then it’s gonna cost you ten grand for fucking us about. Can we get some more poppadoms please?

Matthew Taylor	So where’s the fucking money then you smelly cunt? 

Matthew Taylor	It’s all there?

Carlton Leach	There is no money. 

Matthew Taylor	What the fuck are you doing here?

Carlton Leach	I'm looking after these fellows best interests. 

Matthew Taylor	And what do you know about that?

Carlton Leach	Me? I do this for a living son.

Matthew Taylor	Really? Because from what I hear, you're finished.  Lost it. Games moved on old man.  You see this. This don't concern you. So why don't you take your little firm and fuck off.  If you're not careful, I can see you ending up like your old friend Tony Tucker. 

Matthew Taylor	Agh!

Mad Jack	Who the fuck were they?

Shawn	Did you know them?

Carlton Leach	No.

Shawn	Yeah well they're hardly fucking no one are they. Getting sloppy. 

Carlton Leach	Oh fuck off. 

Shawn	Getting fucking sloppy.

Carlton Leach	What's the matter you're fucking ass dropped ...

Shawn 	You do your fucking homework. Do your fucking homework. 

Kev	Look. Let’s get the fuck out of here. 

Carlton Leach	Cunt. 

Matthew Taylor 	If you're not careful I can see you ending up like your old friend Tony Tucker. 

Denny	You're disgusting. Watch the road girls. Watch the roads. 

Carlton Leach	Hello girls, you alright. 

Jody	Yeah.  You gonna give us a lift dad?

Carlton Leach	No. I got to go to work babe.

Jody	I can't be bothered to walk. 

Carlton Leach	Right. Yeah I'm sorry I’ve got work on. Sorry.
 
Denny	What you doing here?

Carlton Leach	I just come to see how you are. 

Denny	We’re fine. 

Carlton Leach	Yeah it’s been a long night hasn’t it, that’s all.

Denny	Well I suggest you go to bed then.  Come on girls. Let’s go school.

Jody	No we wanna see dad.

Denny	Now. 

Reg	Done well to turn this place round. I didn’t recognise it. Where is Shawn? Given him the night off?

Shawn	No. He’s doing his own thing.

Reg	You two make a strong team.

Carlton Leach	Yeah. We do alright. 

Reg	People are aware of that. 

Carlton Leach	Good. I don't want people thinking I'm finished. 

Reg	I see Denny has moved back in. That’s good isn’t it?

Carlton Leach	How did you know that?

Reg	I seen her and the girls coming out of the house the other morning when I drove past. That’s good that they moved back in with you. 

Carlton Leach	I'm not there. 

Reg	Oh. Sorry. Thought you was. 

Carlton Leach	No. 

Reg	Well maybe you should think about it. You might be leaving yourself open Carlton.

Carlton Leach	I would. Just been busy that’s all.

Reg	Try not to take on too much, yeah. Then things won't get so complicated. 

Carlton Leach	Reg has someone been saying something?

Reg	No. Just don't go too fast, that’s all. Slow down a bit. 

Carlton Leach	Don't you worry about me. 

Reg	I'm not. 

Carlton Leach	Listen. If someone has been shooting their mouth off, it’s probably just some coked up plastic wanna be. Alright. I ain’t gonna lose no sleep over it. You wanna drink?

Lucy	I'm sick of people groping my arse all through the night.

Carlton Leach	Get paid don't you?

Lucy	It’s hard work walking around in high heels and having to deal with coked up perverts all night. 

Carlton Leach	Don't know what the fucking problem is. 

Lucy	You're drunk. Give me the keys. Let me drive.  Come on. I don't wanna fight with you Carlton just give me the fucking keys. 

Carlton Leach	Can't see nothing. 

Lucy	She's really beautiful. I don't know why you're fucking her around. 

Carlton Leach	Has no one told you, I’m a cunt. 

Lucy 	Least you're honest about it. What? Why are you going the wrong way?

Carlton Leach	Get down!  Get down! 

Lucy	What's going on?

Carlton Leach	Get down! Get down!

Lucy	What the fuck is going on? What the fuck is going on.

Carlton Leach	Get down! 

Lucy	Just bring me home. Bring me home now. 

Carlton Leach	We gotta keep active. I ain’t slowing down for no one. That’s why we’re gonna do him. His name is Kenny Davis. He was sent out to Spain to pick up 70 grand. And he forgot to come back. 

Shawn	People have been after this slippery cunt for ages. 

Carlton Leach	Well then it’ll make us look good. He’s hiding out in Portugal. We’re gonna find him.

Mad Jack	How is it I know this geezer?

Carlton Leach	He’s that bald headed monkey that used to work on the door at Kudos. You know the geezer, the one who was always letting in the fucking 16 year olds. 

Kev 	That's right. You were in a lot of teenagers shitting about blowing bubbles.

Mad Jack	Yeah yeah yeah. He’s  a fucking nonce. Be a pleasure to carve that cunt up. 

Lucy	I'm gonna put the kettle on.

Carlton Leach	Is there any beers left?

Lucy	No. 

Shawn	As long as we’re hundred percent sure he’s out there. 

Carlton Leach	No. I'm just gonna send us all on a wild fucking goose chase. Of course I'm fucking sure. I know where he is. He’s in Villa Morta. 

Mad Jack	Villa Morta. 70 grand with all those dirty brasses. Be none of it left. 

Shawn	Lucy is there a bin?

Lucy	Yeah, it’s over the side of the fridge. Will you get me the milk out when you're down there. Would you like  a cup?

Shawn	Yeah go on. 

Lucy	So is this guy really a nonce?

Shawn	Who?

Lucy	The guy you're going to to find?

Shawn	I don't know. I don't care. I treat them all the same. 

Lucy	I just don't know how you do it. I mean ... I couldn’t hurt anyone. I mean what if you kill him?

Shawn	I won't.

Lucy	How do you know?

Shawn	I just do. Do you remember buying your first record?

Lucy	Yeah it was ... Donna Summers’ I Feel Love.

Shawn	And do you remember when you were on the way home and you're so excited, because you couldn’t wait to listen to it?

Lucy	Yeah.

Shawn	And then the minute you get home ... you get it out the sleeve, you put it on the deck ... And you put the needle down softly. And then you're standing there ... and you hold your breath. And you wait for the music to begin. And then it plays. You want Donna Summer to sing forever.  That's the way I feel when I have someone over.  If I killed them, then I’d spoil it.  I don't want any sugar in my tea by the way.

Kev	Remind me to pick up a bottle of Chanel for her indoors.
 
Mad Jack	You're a fucking mug. Get mine a bar of toblerone and she’s well happy. I mean I'm not saying she’s fat or anything but I got on top of her the other night and my fucking ears popped. 

Carlton Leach	Hello.

Denny	Carlton, where are you?

Carlton Leach	Why?

Denny	There’s some geezer parked up outside. He’s been there all morning.

Carlton Leach	Ah? Who is he?

Denny	I don't know. 

Carlton Leach	What car’s he driving?

Denny	It’s a silver Golf. Look I’ve never seen him before. I don't know what he wants. Where are you? I'm at the airport.  I don't like this. Alright. He’s creeping me out. He’s staring straight at me. Carlton. I want you to come home now. Sort this out. 

Carlton Leach	Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright, I’ll come back, alright. 

Denny	Now. 

Carlton Leach	Right just lock the windows and ... lock the windows, lock the doors, and I’ll come back alright. Are you alright? 

Denny	Carlton it’s him. It’s him. He’s here. 

Carlton Leach	Take the girls upstairs. Now. Come on. Girls go upstairs with your mum.

Denny	Sh. Sh. Sh. 

Carlton Leach	Just go upstairs with your mum.

Denny	Just do what he says. 

Matt	Are you Carlton Leach?

Carlton Leach	Yeah. And who the fuck are you?

Matt	I’m I’m really sorry if I caught you at a bad time, but ... I think you're my dad.

Carlton Leach	You better come in.

Matt	That’s a nice name too.

Jaime	Thank you.

Denny	There you go, love. 

Matt	Thanks. 

Denny	Jody are you not gonna say hello to Matt?

Jody	Who are you?

Jody	Don't have a brother. 

Denny	You do babes. 

Jody	Where have you been?

Matt	I’ve been on holiday.

Jody	Was there lots of sunshine?

Matt	Yeah. 

Jody	You ain’t got a tan. 

Carlton Leach	Do you like boxing?

Matt	Yeah. I watched that fight on the telly. It was brutal. But he’s a legend Nigel Benn.

Carlton Leach	I was there that night. Yeah. Me and my mate Tony walked him out.

Matt	Maybe I saw you.

Carlton Leach	Yeah, well you can hardly fucking miss me I was about two and a half stone heavier then. 

Matt	Was you in the ring at the end when it all kicked off?

Carlton Leach	Yeah. Yeah me and Tony bother were. I tell you it was fucking mental. It was just chaos mate. Fucking fists flying everywhere.

Matt	Who’s Tony?

Carlton Leach	He was my best mate. Yeah he died last year. 

Matt	Oh I’m s ... I'm sorry to hear that.

Carlton Leach	It’s alright. 

Matt	You support West Ham?

Carlton Leach	Yeah. Just a bit when they let me in.  So how about you then? You from Watford? Do you get down Vicarage Road?

Matt	No. I’m a Spurs fan. 

Carlton Leach	Fucking front wheel skid. My son a fucking dustbin lid. Oh mate that’s me being punished that is. 

Denny	Give him a break. You’ll stay for dinner won't you Matt? 

Carlton Leach	Sorry about that. Just had to phone work.

Matt	What do you do exactly?

Carlton Leach	Security, mainly. 

Denny	What do you do for work, Matt?

Matt	I'm a gym instructor. 

Denny	Oh yeah. Carlton is into all that.

Carlton Leach	Yeah.

Denny	Can't get into it myself, I’ve got too much to do getting these buggers to school in the morning. 

Matt	Actually, it’s the same. 

Carlton Leach	You want another beer?

Matt	I can't I’m driving. 

Carlton Leach	Well, just stay. We’ve got a thing in the other room, just put it down.

Denny	Yeah, be lovely. Why don't you stay?

Matt	Well, if you're sure. 

Carlton Leach	Yeah. Don’t wanna go all the way back to fucking Watford tonight, do you. It’s miles away. 

Matt	Oh that ... Yeah, that ... that’d be nice. Thanks. 

Kev	Are you two really sisters?

First Sister	Yeah.

Second Sister	Yeah.

Kev	Who is the oldest?

Second Sister	Guess.

Kev	What do you reckon Mad Jack?

Mad Jack	Couldn’t give a flying fuck. Who is the filthiest?

Kev	Do you two come together. 

Second Sister	Yeah. 

Mad Jack	Oh I bet you fucking do. 

Shawn	Get rid of them. 

Dave	Well it’s been a pleasure dribbling over you girls. Now fuck off. 

Kev	Wow wow girls, girls look I'm sorry. Look I’ll see you in the club later or something, yeah? 

Shawn	Carlton’s not coming out anymore. He’s got some family stuff he needs to take care of. He wants us to flop on that greedy cunt tonight in case he slips off. 

Denny	Found a towel for you. Got a toothbrush.

Matt	Thanks. 

Carlton Leach	Listen mate ... son ... There’s  a few things you don't know about me right now.  Please don't be offended or anything, if I don't introduce you to my world straight away.  And I mean we can talk about it any time that’s no problem.  It’s just ... 

Shawn	Go and wait in the car. 

Carlton Leach	The kind of work I do... it’s probably to from you. 

Matt	Of course. I understand. 

Carlton Leach	Thank you. Listen... have a good ... have a good night’s sleep, yeah. I’ll see you in the morning.  Sorry about everything. 

Matt	Don't be. Good night. 

Carlton Leach	Good night son. 

Denny	Carlton. Come here. 

Mad Jack	Alright. Fucking hell, alright darling. How you doing?  How you going babe, alright. 

Kev	Oh wow. Easy. Easy. Easy.  Mate, alright. Fucking hell. 

Mad Jack	Hey girls you wanna drink? Two of them for me please. Sorry mate. Fucking hell. I don't think much of your one, how much is he charging?

Unknown man in club	Are you calling me a fucking English prick? 

Shawn	Ah don't ... 

Mad Jack	Hello baby, you alright. 

Shawn	You gonna take them both, you greedy cunt?

Mad Jack	Don't know I might do. Where is your maters? Your sisters, where are they? Go and get them? They are fucking sisters. [LAUGH]. Hey. I’ll see you about five. 

Kev	Oy oy ... 

Unseen male in club	Fucking cunt you want it! 



Matt	Morning. 

Carlton Leach	Oh morning, you alright. Did you sleep well?

Matt	Yeah. Very well. 

Carlton Leach	Yeah yeah yeah it’s comfortable that sofa bed, I’ve had a sleep on there a few times. You don't have sugar, do you?

Matt	No thanks. 

Denny	Morning love. 

Matt	Moring. 

Carlton Leach	Morning you alright.  Hello mate you alright? When was this? And what about Shawn?  Fucks sake, you got a pen that works? Have you got a fucking pen? Quick.  For fuck’s sake.  Yeah go on mate.  Yeah. Alright. Stay there I’m coming out. 

Denny	Carlton?

Carlton Leach	That toast is burning.  Hello mate. Yeah get your stuff together, alright, I’ve got a job for you. Yeah. Right I’ll be round in a bit.  I can't stay I’ve gotta go the airport.

Denny	What’s happened?

Carlton Leach	Look I can't talk now. Right. I’ll phone you when I get there.

Matt	Do you wanna lift?

Carlton Leach	No. No. I’m fine. I’m fine. 

Kev	I'm sorry Carlton. 

Carlton Leach	Where is he?

Kev	He’s in there. 

Mad Jack	The old bill have been asking questions.

Carlton Leach	Who did this?

Kev	I don't know. There was too many of them. They came out of nowhere. I came out I saw Mad Jack getting attacked, I tried to help him. I hit the floor and covered up and ... Shawn he ... he tried to stand and fight. They just kept stabbing him. 

Mad Jack	This is serious Carlton. Paramedics said he died twice on the way here. 

Carlton Leach	Have you found these cunts?

Felix	Carlton no one has seen them yet. Alright. Now I’ve spoken to everyone and I’ve turned the place upside down. Mate, they’ve probably slipped off and they're out of the fucking country.

Carlton Leach	Fucks sake. This is my fault. I should have been here. I fucking did it again. I fucking walked away. I tell you something, Felix, if he dies, I am fucked. 

Felix	Will you get a fucking grip.

Carlton Leach	For fucks sake. 

Felix	Now I know you want retribution. I know you want retribution but you need to let it go Carlton because it will fucking destroy you. When I was in the regiment I lost guys, Belfast, Ahmar, never saw the perpetrators face, and I had to deal with that. And you have to deal with it. And you need to focus on Shawn.  Focus on Shawn. You need to get a fucking grip Carlton. 

NARRATOR	AT LAST I FOUND MY SON. BUT ALMOST LOST ANOTHER FRIEND TO THIS VIOLENCE THAT SURROUNDS ME.  TO SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO FIGHT UNTIL YOUR LUNGS FILL WITH BLOOD.  I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I STILL HAVE THAT IN ME.  HOW CAN I BRING MATT INTO THIS?  I NEED TO WALK AWAY WHILE I STILL CAN. 

Carly	I can't believe the nod just checked himself out after five days.

Carlton Leach	Yeah well he ain’t keen on hospitals. Soon as his lungs started working he was up and he was out. 
 
Carly	Well what’s he like now

Carlton Leach	His back looks like a human knife rack. But he’ll be alright. 

Matt	Do you think the police will find them?

Carlton Leach	No. No chance. 

Denny	Can tell you two are brother and sister.

Carly	Half. 

Denny 	Alright then half. Both got his nose. 

Carly	Well I’d rather that than his mouth.  

Carlton Leach	That’s charming isn’t it. 

Carly	So are you two back together now then or what?

Demikran	Carlton! Good evening. So how is the food?

Carlton Leach	Just saying wasn’t we, it’s really really nice. Thanks for inviting us mate, I appreciate it. 

Demikran	Well it’s my pleasure. It’s good to see you Denny. Looking as beautiful as ever. He’s a lucky man. 

Denny	Yeah.

Carlton Leach	Oh yeah. 

Demikran	Oh my god Carly. Carly. Carly. She looks like such an independent woman all of a sudden. 

Carlton Leach	Well, I wouldn't go that far. She still knows how to hold her hand out, don't you?  

Demikran	Can you spare your husband?

Denny	You can have him. 

Demikran	There was a reason I invited you here tonight. And it wasn’t ... to buy you dinner. I ... You know, us Turks like to keep things amicable when it comes to business. And in my country, we say, a thousand friends are too few, and one enemy is too many. 

Carlton Leach	So go on then. Who have you upset?

Demikran	Not me my friend. You.  I'm gonna be straight with you Carlton. You've upset a family. They've put a contract out on you. 

Carlton Leach	Which family? The Nortons? 

Demikran	Yeah. 

Carlton Leach	Why?

Demikran	I tried to vouch for you Carlton. I'm sorry. So what you gonna do?

Carlton Leach	Set up a meet. Tell them I’ll go alone. Yeah. 

Demikran	Hm hm.

Carlton Leach	You do that for me?

Demikran	Course I will. Course I will. 

Denny	Are you alright?

Carlton Leach	Yeah. Fine. 

NARRATOR	FROM THE OUTSIDE IT CAN SEEM LIKE A LAWLESS LIFESTYLE. BUT A CRIMINAL SOCIETY IS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER. THERE’S AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. A HIERARCHY YOU HAVE TO RESPECT. THE NORTONS ARE THE GOVERNORS. IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME I’M FUCKED.  BUT IT’S NOT IN MY NATURE TO RUN. THE ONLY WAY I CAN PROTECT MY FAMILY IS TO ACCEPT WHAT’S COMING. 

Carlton Leach	How the fuck did you get up here?

Shawn	Stairs. 

Carlton Leach	What on your own? You're unbelievable. You're supposed to be resting. You're gonna end up breaking your fucking neck. 

Shawn	Yeah well the DJ is getting on my nerves.

Carlton Leach	Why didn’t you answer your phone. 

Shawn	Well come on then, your message sounded urgent, what is it?

Carlton Leach	Nothing. Just thought I’d see if you was alright that’s all. 

Shawn	Well why didn’t you ask me that on the phone.

Carlton Leach	Well pick up the phone next time, maybe I will.  You know when you died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital ... do you remember it?

Shawn	No. 

Carlton Leach	They say that you do.

Shawn	No, don't remember nothing. 

Carlton Leach	Well, maybe that’s it mate.

Shawn	What’s that?

Carlton Leach	Nothing. That’s it.  That’s your lot. 

Shawn	Well you know if you think there’s gonna be any pearly gates for us it ain’t gonna happen mate. 

Carlton Leach	You made a will?

Shawn	No. No I’m not leaving nothing behind. 

Carlton Leach	What about 

Shawn	Well you know she’s ... she’s with her mother and her family, so she’s well looked after, so don't worry about it.

Carlton Leach	You ever think about knocking it all on the head and just going back out there? You know to be with her.

Shawn	Yeah all the time.  But she’s better off in Thailand.  Anyway, who’d look after you?

Carlton Leach	I’ve been putting some doe away for my kids. 

Shawn	Yeah. What’s that?

Carlton Leach	That's a  number for a safety deposit box. Not a massive amount in there but it’ll sort my kids out for a bit when I’m gone. 

Shawn	You alright?

Carlton Leach	Yeah. Just been doing a bit of thinking that’s all.  Will you look after that for me?

Shawn	Yeah, of course mate. 

Carlton Leach	Cheers.  Good morning, girls. 

Jody	Dad. 

Jaime	Dad. 

Carlton Leach	You look smart, don't you, hey. 

Jody	Yeah. 

Denny	What you doing here? 

Carlton Leach	Thought I’d come and say hello. Is that alright? Now you're not gonna drive Mrs Feather up the wall today are you?

Jody	No. 

Carlton Leach	Good. Alright. Well I’ll see you in a bit yeah.  Be good darling. And you trouble. 

Norton Brother	... but a victim must be found. I’ve got a little list ... I’ve got a little list ... You're here. Good. I’m afraid my brothers won't be joining us this evening. But they do send their regards. You got me instead. The runt of the litter. Please take  a seat. I’ve got a little list of society offenders who might well be underground, and who never will be missed. Who never will be missed. Do you like scotch?
 
Carlton Leach	Yeah. 

Norton Brother	So do I. And would you believe it. So does half of Asia too. In fact the last time I had a little drop of this stuff ... I was at the Ritz Carlton in Bangkok, Carlton.  Funny that.  Cheers. Essex boy, hey? Except you're not are you? You’re East End. See, the problem with a lot of them over that way is they seem to take South End literally. I mean it doesn't, it carries on. Paris, Geneva, Monaco, Milan. That’s why my brothers like you Carlton, because you understand that.  So, when someone comes to us asking for you to be taken care of, my brothers and I find it somewhat ... disturbing.

Carlton Leach	Who is it?

Norton Brother	Well if you had taken the time to ask yourself that exact question in the first place, and indeed gone about your work in a more professional way, we wouldn’t have this problem. Instead ... you blinded someone who belongs to someone, who belongs to us.  Your complacency has left the family feeling ... uncomfortable. 

Carlton Leach	I didn’t know. 

Norton Brother	Didn’t know ...

Carlton Leach	They belonged to you.

Norton Brother	Well you fucking do now! A fine single malt is like a complicated woman. Needs to be taken seriously. 

Carlton Leach	The kid had no respect. He had no regard for the death of my good pal Tony Tucker. If I saw him again, I’d take his other eye out. 

Norton Brother	That’s why we’re fond of you Carlton. But you need to show some control over the anger you have inside. Because violence my dear, will only take you so far in this world. Contract has been taken out. It can't just be lifted. Something needs to be done. Done for us. You understand?

Carlton Leach	-Listen if you need something taken care of, I can sort it. 

Norton Brother	We already know you're a leader of men, Carlton. But what happens when you look around and there's no ICF. No firm. No army. Just you alone ... with that fear and self doubt that keeps you awake at night. 

Carlton Leach	I don't need anyone. 

Norton Brother	Good. Because you're going to Rotterdam tonight, alone. You will deliver something to a very dangerous and volatile individual called Lars Becker, who has been a little bit trigger happy recently for our liking.  Be there tomorrow night at 10pm. Someone will meet you. Prove you have some control over the demons you have inside and maybe a little problem you've got will go away.  One other thing. It isn’t a good idea to be there when he opens it. Or you won't be coming back. 

NARRATOR	I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT TONY WAS TRICKED INTO DEATH. BUT MAYBE LIKE ME HE JUST DIDN’T HAVE A CHOICE.  BUT I WILL DIE WITH DIGNITY. 

Carlton Leach	Where we going? 

Gangster 	You'll see.  Get out. 

Lars Becker	At last we meet. The ICF general, and West Ham’s top boy. It’s a shame we didn’t come face to face on the terraces. [INAUDIBLE] welcomes you to Rotterdam Carlton. Tell me how is the Yid Army these days?

Carlton Leach	Same a Ajax. Bunch of cunts. 

Lars Becker	I believe you've got something for me.  We’ve walked the same path you and I from the dogs to the terraces and now we found each other at the top table. 

Carlton Leach	No, this is it. No more. I'm getting out. I’ve fulfilled my obligation. Now can you get one of these lads to drop me back at the port?

Lars Becker	You'll be walking away from a lot of money, Carlton. The Nortons now have businesses in Thailand Cambodia, they need people like you and me to take control over there.

Carlton Leach	No my family is more important. It’s a young man’s game. I'm walking away.

Lars Becker	Retirement is a fantasy Carlton. You've chosen this life. And now it’s chosen you. When you look in to the eyes of these men you'll see that they've accepted it to you. We’re all on borrowed time Carlton. But they enjoy fear because they understand it. 
 
Carlton Leach	I’ve lost too many friends. I can't do this. It’s over. 

Lars Becker	Take him to the port.

Gangster 	Come on. 

LANGUAGE SUBTITLE	Execute him and throw his body in the sea.

Lars Becker	You think you saved my life. But in fact ... you saved your own.  Welcome to the family Carlton. 

Carlton Leach	Hello mate, you alright. You ain’t going are you?

Unknown male	Going nowhere mate. 


Mad Jack	Arsene you ginger cunt! Pass the fucking ball.  Fucking mug. So where is Cambodia then?

Felix	It’s in Thailand you prick. 

Mad Jack	Yeah? All those dirty fuck lady boys you would know wouldn't you ... you sweaty. 

Felix	Fuck you. Prick. 

Mad Jack	So when we going?

Carlton Leach	We’re not. 

Reg	I was just explaining to the boys about our plans, talking of which ... where is your boy today?

Kev	I didn’t know you had a son?

Reg	Oh sorry. My mistake. He’s probably at a Spurs game. 


NARRATOR	WHEN YOU'VE GOT FAMILY IT MAKES YOU VULNERABLE. LARS WAS RIGHT, I’VE HOSEN THIS LIFE, NOW IT’S CHOSEN ME. AND THE MERRY GO ROUND JUST TURNS AND TURNS. THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO LEAVE THIS LIFE, IS WHEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND TAKES IT
