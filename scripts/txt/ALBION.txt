(ALBION THE ENCHANTED STALLION)



 RADIO ANNOUNCER	Good morning Vermont! It's the day before Christmas and the big guy is right around the corner. We're looking at your favorite Christmas hits all day long so… 

EVIE	Morning pops. 

CONNOR	Hey.. 

EVIE	The doctor said that, if you go out and about more. You'd get your strength back. You probably wouldn't get sick as much. 

CONNOR	I know. 

EVIE	Never mind. Hey pops, we can always try again tomorrow. 

CONNOR	Okay.

EVIE	Oh my gosh, dad. So last night I had a dream about this stallion. He was so gorgous dad, you wouldn’t believe it.
 
CONNOR	I dunno, sounds like a kelpie to me.
 
EVIE	Whats a kelpie?
 
CONNOR	Oh you don't want to know about kelpies.
 
EVIE	Yes I do, I just asked.

CONNOR	They're scary and not for ki- 

EVIE	Dad.
 
CONNOR	Alright, but I warned you. were once dark, shape-shifting spirits, that would take the shape of beautiful horses. They lived near water. And they were known to take the form of both human and horse. But the thing about kelpies was, they they had the ability to see straight through into your heart of hearts. So if they saw wickedness, they would entice these strangers, especially wicked children, to ride upon their backs. And then they would dive into lakes and their riders were never heard from again. 

 EVIE	Drown?
 
 CONNOR	Nobody knows.
 
 EVIE	Eaten?
 
CONNOR	Nobody knows.
 
EVIE	Alright, I gotta get going to the barn. ( SINGS TO A HORSE VO) « Hush now, Don’t be scared Through this tide of darkness. Shadows may march, Thunders may roar, but Peace will soon prevail. « Like that one, Snicks? Okay, okay. 

MOLLY	Wow it stinks in here. How do you even stand it? 

MOLLY'S MOM	White linens? Seriously, this is not a Vegas buffet! 

MOLLY	Mother. 

MOLLY'S MOM	You know I hate when you call me that. It makes me sound so old. 

EVIE	Now don’t be too much trouble, you hear me? You gotta make a good first impression. 

BRIAN	You got the new one ready? 

EVIE	He's nervous.
 
BRIAN	Molly.

MOLLY’S DAD	Merry Christmas, honey! 

BRIAN	Right up there sweetheart. 

MOLLY	He's beautiful. I’m going to ride him every day!
 
BRIAN	You look wonderful. Honey, you just-  Stay calm, okay? 

EVIE	Put your hands forward.

BRIAN	Keep your hands forward, sweetheart.
 
MOLLY	I want to get off.
 
BRIAN	Don't pull on the reins. The horse is just getting used to the barn.
 
MOLLY'S DAD	Can she get off the horse now? 

BRIAN	Don't-don't-
 
MOLLY	No! I don’t want him! 

BRIAN	Give him some time sweetheart.
 
MOLLY	I SAID I DON’T WANT HIM!! 

BRIAN	Please.. If you'll just. 

BRIAN	Just take the time, okay, he'll be fine, okay, I promise. 

MOLLY'S DAD	Is this what I paid for? This isn't what we talked about. Its not the horse.
 

EVIE	Don’t worry about what any of those stuffed shirts think. You’re special. My dad always says that being special doesn’t usually mean you’re better than anyone else, it’s just normally something inside that no one can really see. So maybe we’re both special.

MOLLY	You think you're special? 

EVIE	No. 

MOLLY	Good. Because I heard your dad is a cripple. So what would he know about being special? You're just a stable girl. Now get away from my horse.
 


BRIAN	Well, that couldn’t have gone worse. I gotta get a new instructor in here. Evie, I'm gonna have to have you come in tomorrow to feed and clean stalls.
 

EVIE	It’s Christmas, Mr. McKarran.
 
BRIAN	I know.

EVIE	My dad's caretaker is off for the day and he’s going to need me-
 
BRIAN	Evie. I’m taking a big risk having you work here in the first place. You’re underage. You can't give me the hours I want. But I like ya, and I know you need the money, but if you can’t come in, I’m gonna have to get somebody full time.
 
EVIE	No. I get it. I'll be here tomorrow.
 
BRIAN	Merry Christmas, Evie.
 
EVIE	Merry Christmas. That horse today. Why can some people just be and have and do whatever they want but the rest of us just have to sit back and watch? Pops, I'm home! 

CONNOR	You just have to get out ther and go after it. You know a rich life isn’t about material wealth; its from inside, from the spirit. It takes a very special person to be able to achieve the proper balance.

EVIE	Is that a super obscure way of saying you think it’s better that I don’t have a horse, because I gotta tell you I'm having a little trouble following that logic, Pop.

CONNOR	No. What I’m saying is, is whatever you think is an advantage isn’t always what it seems. The most prosperous people I have ever known don’t have half  your goodness. Now you are special. And I’d be lost without you.

EVIE	Let’s get you to bed, pop. 

BRIAN	Give him some time. 

MOLLY	I said I don't want him! 

BRIAN	Evie would you mind showing eveybody how its done?
 
MOLLY	Whoa Evie, that’s amazing. Will you teach me? 

EVIE	Sure. Dad? Thanks for the horses dad. Morning guys! It's Christmas, how bout a treat? How bout some warm bran-mash? Really? Which one of you did this? Hello? Hello?  Whoa, whoa. Hey, there, boy. Easy. Easy. What are you doing out here? You're a pretty boy. Where's your rider? No rider? Hello?! Is anybody out there?! Hello?! I have your horse! And he looks kinda familiar to me. Come on, buddy. Lets get you back to the barn before you freeze out here. Come on. Come on, buddy. I don’t know what you want me to do. No. Absolutely not. No getting on strange horses. Fine. You win. No warm barn for you. Fine. I can see you. I can see you moving. I know you don't want me to leave you out here. No no, wait, what are you doing?  Great. Whoa! I'm telling you righ tnow, if you throw me, I'm gonna be so mad at you. You hear me mister? WHOA! Whoa, whoa. Hey slow down.  Good boy. What on Earth? Where are we? I will be in so much trouble. Global warming just like happen or something? Did we time travel?  Like a different country? What? Don’t look at me like that. I am not happy about this. This is crazy, I cant recognize anything. Okay, there is no way this is Vermont. HELLO!!! ECHO!!! It was just REALLY annoying, you know. I mean she looked right at me and was just like “you think you’re special”, and I just kinda froze and was like “uuuuhhhhh”. The whole thing caught me off guard, you know. Are you sure this is the right way? Good, becasue my dad will freak out if I'm not home soon. Wait. What's that? What is that? Hello! Hello!
 
MAGIC PAINTING CHAR	Is that her? It must be. She's here, she's here. Tell the others. She doesn’t look like much. Places everyone, places! 

DAIMHIN	Hello, Evelyn Flynn. 

EVIE	Who are you? How do you know my name?
 
DAIMHIN	I’ve been waiting for you for a very long time.
 

EVIE	Where am I?

DAIMHIN	You are inside the Cave of Revelation. Everything is seen as it truly is. Stones from this cave were used to forge the Scepter of Truth. You are here for a reason, Evelyn Flynn.

EVIE	What's happening?
 
DAIMHIN	The cave is showing you something. This is the world of Albion. Albion was home to the Danann, a peaceful and selfless race. The Danann possessed four ancient Treasures that maintained harmony among their people. The Scepter of Truth, no one can lie in it's presence. Cauldron of Plenty. To never know hunger. The Flame of Knowledge. The answer to all questions. The Book of Healing. To heal all wounds. One day, the Milesians arrived. Carried on dark clouds from the Northern Worlds. Led by the evil and greedy General Eeder. They came to take the four treasures and destory the Danann people. Desprerate for peace, the queen of the Denann sought out the Abbess. A magical being who lives separate from either race. She brokered a treaty bound by magic. And it was agreed that Albion would be divided in half. But in a wicked piece of trickery, the Milesian General chose “the top half” of Albion, subjugating the Danann to the world underground. The General’s obsession with the day he will finally rid his world of the Danann has grown with every passing year. Some believe that day to finally be at hand. 

MAGIC PAINTING CHAR	This ought to be good. Did she like it? She hasn’t said anything. Huh. 

EVIE	I'm in another world?!

DAIMHIN	There are portals between our two worlds that are ever changing. 

ABBESS PAINTING	Dear Evie, the Danann people need your help. 

ERIU	Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.  Who are you? What are you doing here? I have absolutely no idea. Where did ya come from? 

EVIE	From Vermont.
 
ERIU	What land is this Vermont? I don’t really understand the question. Why did you steal my horse? I know you're not my horse, I was just- Can you please allow me to continue questioning the prisioner? Why did ya steal my horse? 

EVIE	Your horse, no I swear, I didn’t know. 

ERIU	You don’t have to swear. You couldn’t lie if you wanted to. The Scepter won’t allow- You are not in charge of this quest. She could be a Milesian spy- What do you mean you brought her here? Are you insane? We’re on a perilous mission that could include death and torture.  

EVIE	Hey!

ERIU	The last thing we need is a frightened little girl- 

EVIE	Hey!
 
ERIU	Would you please be quiet a moment!
 
EVIE	No I won't.  Who- Who- Who are you?  Who are YOU? Where are YOU from? Who is this crazy HORSE?! AND WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE YOU’RE HAVING A CONVERSATION?!!
 

ERIU	Youre an odd little girl Evie. 

EVIE	How does everyone know my name?! 

ERIU	Dag Dia told me.
 
EVIE	Who's Dag Dia? 

ERIU	The kelpie. The horse. NO! She is not going with us.

EVIE	I'm not going anywhere with you.
 
ERIU	Exactly. Kindly hand me back The Scepter and we’ll be on our way. 

EVIE	Is this the Scepter of Truth?
 
ERIU	Really? A powerful, priceless artifact and you go arund announcing that we have it to the world.
 
EVIE	He didn’t tell me. The Cave of Revelation did. And a strange man-
 


ERIU	Really? I've heard legends of magic in there. Men who would turn to horses, or vise versa, or something like that. Kelpies, they call them. I never believed that though. Just blarney for the half-wits. Thank you. 

EVIE	Look, please help me. I need to go home. My father is not well. It’s Christmas. 


ERIU	What’s “Christmas”? 

EVIE	Christmas. You know, Santa. He has these elves that help him fly around the world in one night delivering presents on a sleigh pulled by magical reindeer.
 
ERIU	Sorry. Can’t help you. I’m incredibly busy trying to save my people from certain annihilation, and unfortunately it’s a bit time sensitive, so... No! She is not coming with us, she is obviously mad. Would you like to join us on our quest that has absolutely nothing to do with you, bares no consequence for your future whatsoever, upon which you, as a small helpless child, will almost certainly perish? 

EVIE	No. 

ERIU	Well, I tried. Let's go. 

EVIE	Wait, how do I get home? 

ERIU	FINE. Our first mission is to find the Flame of Knowledge. Which Dag Dia believes will show you your path. If you would like to join us. 

EVIE	I would.
 
ERIU	..Perfect.
 
EVIE	Just to the Flame. Then I go home.
 
ERIU	Hold this. We need ot get going, Milesians use the weather to track us. Looks like rain. We're not gonna out run the rain. Here put this on. It'll protect ya.
 
EEDER	ÉREMON! ÉREMON! ÉREMON! Again. That's better. What is this? What is this? Is someone trying to assassinate me? Show me your hands. All of you. Now! Show me your hands. Now. All of you! Treachery. 

MISSING FINGER ATT	Terribly sorry my lo-
 
EEDER	Treachery!
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	Tis just a flesh wound, sire. You see, I was giving you your daily mutton...
 
EEDER	Mutton, mutton, I love mutton.
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	Well of course you do.
 
EEDER	Is there mutton there?
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	I let my stupid hand linger too long LIKE A FOOL.
 
EEDER	Those wreched...

MISSING FINGER ATT	And if you’d be so kind as to return my brainless little digit. I’ll take a quick jaunt down to the seamstress and see if she can’t sew the half-witted little nubbin back on.
 
EEDER	Hang him.
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	OH NO! My lord! No!

EEDER	No, no, no! Um.
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	Oh thank you, my lord, I knew you’d never- 

EEDER	Skin him. 

MISSING FINGER ATT	OH NO! NOO!

EEDER	No no wait! Wait, wait. I may want his skin on. Throw him in a dungeon that’s really horrible and I'll make my mind up later.
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	Oh no! 

EEDER	Éremon! What are you doing here? 

ÉREMON	You sent for me, my lord. 

GENERAL EEDER	AH! Yes. I saw something. A flash. Through the rain. Then it was gone. It felt like... It felt like something I haven’t sensed for a long time. 

EEDER	I can’t put my finger on it. But I saw some strange magic. In the form of a little girl. Now Éremon, I want you to seek out this child. Find her and destroy her.
 
E?REMON	I don’t chase little girls. What possible threat could she hold? 
 
EEDER	Do you insult me, E?remon? 

ÉREMON	Nay. My lord.
 
EEDER	I am too close for any complications. Fail me now and I shall drink the marrow from within thy bones.
 
E?REMON	You shall have her little heart, my Lord.
 
EEDER	Thank you. So, off to the Wicklen Mountains.
 
ÉREMON	My lord. 

EVIE	Who are those people?

ERIU	Those are the Kukri, don’t worry about them, they must have a camp nearby.

EVIE	Okay now I need food.

ERIU	We don’t have time, if im not back five day from now-

EVIE	What, you'll be grounded?

ERIU	Well, yes. I'll become the ground.

EVIE	What?!

ERIU	The treaty allows five Danann a five day window each Harvest Moon to forage for provisions so we don’t starve. Once the Moon completes its cycle, if you’re Danann and you’re above ground you become the earth.

EVIE	Well, on the bright side, at least I’ll have starved to death before then.

ERIU	You're an odd little girl Evie. 

 EVIE	Can I ask you something?

ERIU	If I said ‘no’, would it stop you?

EVIE	Good point. I don’t mean any offense by this, but why wouldn’t The Danann have sent like an army or something to get the Treasures?

ERIU	It’s in the fine print. No army nor leader may cross the barrier as long as the Treaty stands. Warriors have tried and failed.  

EVIE	So now it’s just you? 

ERIU	It’s not just me. They chose me for this mission. I was the strongest, the most resilient, the most skilful of all the Danann. 

EVIE	Wow, that’s amazing. 

ERIU	It is.
 
EVIE	How do you know where we’re going?
 
ERIU	Dag Dia knows the way to The Abbess. The Torch will show us the rest from there. 

EVIE	The Abbess. Is she good?
 
ERIU	I don’t know. I’ve never met her, but she was a great friend to The Danann in those early years, after the fall. Some believe she’s dead. Dag Dia doesn’t, though. 

EVIE	Can others understand him too?
 
ERIU	He’s following us. I know. I know. We’re goin- 

LÍR	No not my hair! Not the hair!
 
ERIU	What are you doing here?! 

LI?R	I'm rescuing you! What’s it look like?
 
ERIU	I don’t need rescuing! Go home, Li?r!
 
EVIE	You two know each other? 

ERIU	Li?r’s family are the protectors of The Scepter of Truth. Such close proximity for so long has made Li?r unable to lie, which, mixed with a staggering vanity, makes for a rough conversation.
 

LÍR	I'm not vain. I am simply aware that I am usually the most striking individual in nearly all assorted company. And the present is not excluded.
 
EVIE	Holy wow... Is he for real? 

LÍR	Of course I’m real. Do you suspect me to be some kind of ghost? Is she a half-wit?
 
EVIE	I really don’t like him.

ERIU	Go home Lir. 

LÍR	You can’t just steal The Scepter and go gallivanting around Albion with it. The Elders are furious. 

ERIU	The Elders won’t listen! What are we supposed to sit and do nothing? Something's going on, Li?r, I know it. Where are the foragers?
 
LI?R	Perhaps they simply got lost.
 
ERIU	Foragers don’t get lost.
 
LI?R	What are you saying?
 
ERIU	I don’t know. We’re going to see The Abbess- 

LÍR	The Abbess? You two would seek out the sorceress?
 
ERIU	Are you scared?
 
LÍR	Nah. Wait. Yes.
 
EVIE	Why the change?
 
LI?R	Because I just realized I can’t let you go alone.
 
ERIU	NO.

LÍR	YES.

ERIU	NO.

LÍR	Yes 'Im afraid so. I can see you’re upset that I’m coming with you, but I’d like you both to think about  how awful I feel about how inappropriately I’m dressed such a quest.  

ERIU	Stay out of my way. Don’t you say anything. How's the view back there, my brave knight?

LÍR	Truthfully, his has always been your best angle.
 
EVIE	You totally like him.

ERIU	You don’t know what you're talking about.

EVIE	It’s obvious. He’s really cute. Though I’m starting to think honesty is seriously overrated.

ERIU	You’re out of your depth here, Evie. I no more fancy him than a baby bird fancies having a disease-ridden tick on its neck.

EVIE	Did you just call yourself a baby bird?

ERIU	Enough on the subject!

EVIE	That’s why you’re mean to him. You’re trying to flirt.
 
ERIU	You're completely- No, no, no, no… Charys...Mara... 

LÍR	The Foragers.
 
ERIU	They're turning! It's only been three days and they're turning. Now do you believe me?! Does that look like they ‘just got lost’?! 

EVIE	What could have done this?
 
ERIU	They’re killing our foragers to starve us out. The Milesians will answer for this.

LÍR	We have to leave them. We can’t be exposed at night... 

E?REMON	Two fled on horseback. West. Both female. Shallow hoove prints. That is no place for our kind. Men whose deeds should remain in the shadows. Move! 

EVIE	Another cave? 

ERIU	Dag Dia says the passage to the lair of The Abbess lies within, beneath The Eyes of Judgement.

EVIE	The Eyes of Judgement? 

ERIU	I think we’ll camp just inside the mouth of the cave. Move forward in the morning.
 
LI?R	Thank the Gods!

EVIE	Scared?

LI?R	What if a bat flew into my hair. Think about that for a moment. 
 
EVIE	So, you used to be in charge of protecting The Scepter?

LI?R	I was. I am. I protected it from scratches, water marks, sun damage.
 
EVIE	Sun damage? You live underground.

LÍR	There was a spider once- 

EVIE	What're you doing? Guys.
 
ERIU	Evie! Nothing! There's no sign of any eyes, painted or carved. Not the slightest sign of any sort of doorway or anything man-made. I’m about to tear out my hair! 

LI?R	Please don’t. You would look hideous bald. You have a very strange shaped head. She’s correct. If this indeed was the hiding place of The Abbess, seems like she’s moved on.
 
ERIU	She's left us behind. I’m telling you, there were no eyes painted or carved, judging or otherwise.
 
EVIE	Um. Guys. 

ERIU	I am Eriu, of the Danann. I wish to pass through the portal. Move back , it won't work with you here. 

EVIE	There’s no way those were the magic words. Maybe it’s needs to be a riddle or something.  Abra-cadabra! Alacazam! Open sesame? What? Those are really powerful words in my world.

ERIU	As I was saying, only Danann can pass through the portal.

EVIE	Any ideas?

ERIU	He’s never been inside. He doesn’t know the ritual or cÉremony it takes. 

EVIE	CÉremony. Give me the Sceptor. Give me your hand. Come on. 

ERIU	OW!
 
LI?R	What in all the Gods- 

EVIE	Maybe it needs to be a love scene. Maybe the wall needs proof of Danann love. Come on here. Maybe that’s what the dream was saying.
 
ERIU	What dream? What are you talking about?
 
EVIE	Come on here. Come on, wake up.

LÍR	Huh. Its fine. I'm fine, its just that I- 

EVIE	Now take his other hand in yours. 

ERIU	No.
 
EVIE	Take his other hand.

ERIU	No, look whatever notion you have in your tiny head about me and this featherbrained-

EVIE	Scared of the truth?

ERIU	I'm not afriad of anything.
 
EVIE	Ooh! Wow! True love.

ERIU	I'll cut out your tongue. Walk.

EVIE	Thank you Evie, couldn’t have done this without you, Evie,  you’re so clever Evie.... 

ERIU	I can hear you. 

EVIE	Do we just knock?

FERAL WOMAN	I wouldn’t.
 
ERIU	Who are you? 

FERAL WOMAN	Hi, Dag Dia.
 
ERIU	How do you know Dag Dia?
 
FERAL WOMAN	Everyone knows Dag Dia, stupid.
 
EVIE	We're trying to find The Abbess.  

ERIU	Yeah we're trying to find the Abbess.

EVIE	Can you help us? 

FERAL WOMAN	They can never agree on anything. No more yelling! I can't concentrate! I have to understand this before they come or I wont understand it when they come. Do you not understand this?

WOMAN IN BLUE	to me!!  We have to have weapons ready when they come! 

WOMAN IN GREEN	For the last time, how many are coming?! We only have so many saucers and spoons!!
 
 FERAL WOMAN	..saucers and spoons...saucers and spoons..
 
ERIU	Hello?

WOMAN IN RED	These roguish kings had better be handsome, for I do not intend to wed a goblin. 

WOMAN IN BLUE	There’s not going to be a wedding because we’re going to destroy every last one of them!!
 
WOMAN IN GREEN	A wedding! No one said anything about a wedding!! We only have so many saucers and spoons!
 
ERIU	Hello! 

WOMAN IN RED	I think I’ll have you be the priest for my wedding. You look priestish.
 
WOMAN IN BLUE	NO WEDDING!! NO KING!! 

WOMAN IN GREEN	NO SAUCERS!! NO SPOONS!!!

YELLOW, GREEN, RED	They've come. 

WOMAN IN RED	Where is my king? Will he not come for me? 

WOMAN IN BLUE	Where is your hidden army, girl? 

ERIU	We’re just looking for The Abbess. 

WOMAN IN GREEN	What do you think? It’s nearly done. 

WOMAN IN BLUE	Do not try and fool me.
 
WOMAN IN GREEN	Not yet. 

WOMAN IN BLUE	I will send them a box of your fingers as proof of our might! 

ERIU	Disgusting. 

YELLOW	I can’t figure this out! The book says: “There is a truth beyond what our eyes see, the truth is that one must often surrender before one can win.” 

EVIE	I'm sorry, I don't know either. 

WOMAN IN BLUE	This book is nonsense! Surrender in order to win? If we followed that, we’d all be living in dungeons! Now, from which direction will they attack?! TELL ME!! TELL ME NOW!! 

EVIE	I don’t know. 

LI?R	By the Gods! Unhand those ladies you multifarious hags!! 

WOMAN IN BLUE	The enemy!
 
YELLOW	Multifarious?
 
WOMAN IN GREEN	Another mouth.
 
YELLOW	He must be a scholar.
 
WOMAN IN RED	You came for me. 

ERIU	The Milesians are coming, we need to go now. 

FERAL WOMAN	Please! They’re going to get us! Please, help us! Please! 

EVIE	It's okay, it- (SINGS) Hush now, Don’t be scared Through this tide of darkness. 

EVIE AND FERAL W.	(SING) Shadows may march, Thunders may roar, but peace will soon prevail. 

EVIE & ALL OTHER WOM.	Through our land, This sacred land Nightmares spread confusion But stand your ground Until you’ve found The strength to light your way
 
EVIE	The Abbess.

LÍR	Beautiful. 

 ERIU	Dag Dia was right, she didn't leave us.
 
ABBESS	You saved me, Evie. I’ve been in that state, split and lost to myself, for a great many years. The treasures of The Danann are very powerful. Possessing one of them for too long will throw the power of the others out of balance.
 
ERIU	The legend says that taking back  the Danann treasures is the only way to reverse the magic of the treaty and destroy the barrier.
 
ABBESS	That is half of it. The four treasures must be brought together and the two bloodlines must agree to reverse the spell.
 
LI?R	That will never happen. 

EVIE	Positivity, Li?r. Positivity.
 
LI?R	I am positive that will never happen. 

ERIU	If they don't, we will take it by force.
 
LÍR	Okay. 

ABBESS	I believe this is what you came for? 

VOICE SINGS	Hush now, Don’t be scared Through this tide of darkness. 

EVIE	I'm seeing so many strange things, I- 

ABBESS	Unless you focus, the Flame will show you what it wants. Focus on your pathway home. 

EVIE	I see a lakeside. Its wonderful.
 
ABBESS	That must be your passage home.
 
ERIU	Look for the Book. Look for the Book. 

EVIE	You look.
 
ERIU	I see um.. A tower? No, wait, a monastery? 

ABBESS	At the edge of the Dorillian Crag. A day’s journey from here.

EVIE	Your grace, how did you know that song that I sang to you? 

ÉREMON	Strike. 

ERIU	They’re trying to break down the wall. 

EVIE	We need to find that book.
 
ERIU	I thought you were going home.

EVIE	You guys couldn’t get three feet without me. 

LÍR	I could get three feet without you, is anyone else following that logic?  

ÉREMON	Strike! Strike! 

LÍR	One of my steps is like three of yours, so in the end- 

ABBESS	You must go! The Milesians are nearly through! 

EVIE	What about you?

ABBESS	I’ll be fine. Please. Go. And may the Gods be with you.
 
ÉREMON	Strike! You are a fool to harbor these rebels, Malvina. Those children will surely die, and you, you will have led them to such a fate.

ABBESS	Perhaps. Or they may just save this world from a fate worse than death.
 
ERIU	Its too steep you'll have to stay here and keep a look out. No one will get hurt, you have my word. Unless he won’t give us the Book.Alright, no killing! 

EVIE	Don't worry, we'll be careful. 

LÍR	Honestly, I could make it three feet without you.

LÍR	I could make it three hundred feet.

ERIU	Alright. This is it.

LÍR	Show you whats inside?

ERIU	The book is inside. 

EVIE	If there’s a skeleton inside…I’m going to scream.

ERIU	Li?r, a little help here.

LI?R	Sorry! 

ERIU	I think its Gallgaidheal, one of the Brothers Dunn. By the Gods!

EVIE	What was he thinking?!
 
LI?R	Perhaps he was having one of those flying dreams. I have those a lot. 

ERIU	STOP! 

EVIE	We're not going to hurt you. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Get away, I say. GO! I don’t care if they're nice! They’re trying to steal something from me and I won’t have it! Why, of course it belongs to me! I bought it at-I found it in-I traded for- I cant think. It must be this eejit branch! Now I can think. Where was I? 

EVIE	You were talking about how you got the book of healing.
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	Thank you. So I got the Book of Healing- How do you know about that?! Did you come to steal it away?! Come to steal my power, huh?! A minion of General Eeder, eh?! I can smell the stench of a dirty, stinking Milesian anywhere! 

ERIU	Gallgaidheal, please-

GALLGAIDHEAL	Don’t call me that, I hate being called that.
 
 EVIE	Okay...what should we call you?
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	My friends call me Gally. 

EVIE 	Okay, Gally-

GALLGAIDHEAL	BUT YOU ARE NOT MY FRIENDS! No they're not. They’re book thieves. Especially the redheaded one!
 
ERIU	Wait, you can understand Dag Dia?
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	Of course I can! 	How can I understand you?! Because you’re my brother? 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Because he’s my brother!

ERIU	Your brother?
 
EVIE	His brother? 

GALLGAIDHEAL	That’s what I said! Are you deaf?! He’s my- My brother? Oh brother. All these years, I thought you were dead.
 
LÍR	Why is he hugging that horse? 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Why did you not come for me sooner, brother? I’ve been so horribly lonely. And how did you get so tall? I must have missed that part during the running away and all that.
 
ERIU	Dag Dia said he was mortally wounded by The Milesians in the fortress, and the Abbess saved him by changing him into a Kelpie. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Well, fear not, brother! Much has transpired in your absence. Look around. I own everything. All the kingdoms above and below. Mine. So feel free to trot where you like.

ERIU	What are you talking about?
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	Well, if you must know, little redheaded book thief. I am a god.
 
ERIU	A god? 

GALLGAIDHEAL	A god. 

LÍR	You're not a god.
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	Yes I am. 

 ERIU	No you're not.
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	Yes I am. 

EVIE	Look, it’s not that we don’t believe you-

LÍR	Yes it is, I don’t believe him.

EVIE	You are not helping. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	I have been burned to death; frozen; I have been torn apart by wolves; I have fallen from a five hundred foot cliff onto really pointy rocks; I have been drowned; struck by lightning; I have been squashed by an extremely fat cow. My eyes plucked out; my ears sawed off; I cut my own heart out, sliced it into three, then I juggled it for a little while; I cut myself directly in half, trying to find a friend; and nothing. Nothing. I am invincible. I am inextinguishable! I! Am! A! God! 

EVIE	Could have a tiny bit to with you having the Book of Healing. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Nonsense. Wait, is that we ya come? 

ERIU	We need the Book to save the Danann once and for all from the Milesians. And we only have two days left, or the Danann will most surely perish.
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	Oh! Why didn’t you just say that in the first place? There ya are. To be honest I was getting tired of the dirty old manuscript anyway. Tedious reading material, if you ask me. Well, it was nice meeting y'all, brother- We gotta do it again soon, catch up, fun times. Best of luck to ya then.
 
EVIE	Lir, can you see the Monastery from here? 

LÍR	No, no. I can honestly say I can not see the Monastery from here.
 
ERIU	By the Gods! You call yourself a man?! 

EVIE	It’s still bleeding. It’s not the wrong book. 
 
EVIE	GALLGAIDHEAL! 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Miss you too, friends.
 
EVIE	Gally!

ERIU	Where did he go? 

EVIE	Gally! Gally, I know you're out there. I know you're listening. We didn’t come to steal from you. Your people are in great danger. And they need your help.
 
ERIU	We don’t have time. That crazed looney bird could be getting further away by the second. We have to split up to find him and catch him.

EVIE	Gally, I know what it’s like to be alone. To feel like you only have yourself to rely on. And as much as your family wants to help, they can’t. I’ve felt like that most of my life. But these people are good. They don’t want to hurt you. And your brother must care very deeply for you. Because he brought us all this way, just hoping that he could find you. You don’t have to be alone anymore, Gally. Who wants to be invincible anyway? Sounds pretty boring to me.

ERIU	The Flame will show us where he is. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	It is boring. It’s terribly boring. You can't imagine. Have you ever been swallowed by a whale? I had to wait for it to poop me out. Spent weeks in there. Uncomfortable, to say the least.

EVIE	For you and the whale, I’m sure. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	I’ll make you a trade, little girl.
 
EVIE	You can call me Evie.
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	I’ll make a trade then, Evie. One Book of Healing... for one friend. How does that sound? Will you be my friend?

EVIE	How about three for the price of one? I’ll even throw in a brother.

GALLGAIDHEAL	Brother. Here. 

EVIE	Wow. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Should we heal the skinny, cowardly on then, huh?
 
EVIE	What's up?

ERIU	The book might cure him of his honesty problem.

EVIE	Isnt that a good thing?

ERIU	I cant lie, he has somewhat grown on me. 

EVIE	Like a boyfriend?

ERIU	Like a fungus. But, like a fungus I'm not quite sure I want to be cured of just yet. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Now, we will cure you, my brother. 

E?REMON	Don’t mind us. We were just enjoying your delightful little scene. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	THE MILESIANS!!
 
LI?R	Run, Eriu! Now! 

EVIE 	Go! 

ÉREMON	She matters not! We have what we came for. These relics share the Danann symbol. This day has been far more fruitful than possibly imagined. And who are you, little girl?
 
EVIE	My name is Evelyn. People call me Evie.
 
E?REMON	And what mission are you on, Evelyn?
 
EVIE	I’m just trying to go home, sir.

 
E?REMON	Are you indeed? And where is home, sweetheart?
 
EVIE	Cedar Creek, Vermont.
 
E?REMON	I know no such land.
 
EVIE	I didn’t think you would.
 
E?REMON	Bind them! Tell me Evelyn, why help the Danann? Their fight is not yours. 

EVIE	The Danann were forced by a tyrant to leave everything they love and hide underground. They only want their homes back and to live in peace. To me, that sounds like a cause worth fighting for.
 
E?REMON	That’s only their side of the story.

EVIE	Is there another side? 

ÉREMON	No.

EVIE	Why do you help the Milesians? 

E?REMON	I am Milesian.

EVIE	So?

E?REMON	I’ve never been asked that before. No wonder General Eeder finds you so interesting. I thought you were supposed to kill the girl? What happened to bringing the General her little heart? Do not involve yourself in my affairs if you wish to survive the night. I had a daughter once. Would've been about your age. Your spirit reminds me of hers. 

EVIE	Once? 

ÉREMON	The Great War took her from me. Her and her mother.
 
EVIE	They were killed by Danann?
 
ÉREMON	They were killed by men, type doesn't matter. Men destroy everything, Evie. I have never seen an exception. That is why I give no man my love nor my hatred. I give them only my indifference, and they give me their gold. 

EVIE	I believe that you are a better man than you pretend to be. 

ÉREMON	Is that right? And what possibly makes you think that?
 
EVIE	You act bad. I know there's good in you. Which side do you think your daughter would have fought for? If she were me. 

ÉREMON	There is nothing good about me, Evelyn. Nothing. I have done things that your innocent little mind couldn't even imagine.  am the reason children are afraid of the dark. I am the jackal who preys upon the wounded. I love not. I feel not. I care not. If you are looking for a savior, be prepared to be very disappointed in me. Now, I know that you can hear my thoughts, and I do not know why. But I promise you, I will root it out. Make no mistake, little girl. Even if it costs you your life.
 
EVIE	I don’t believe you. Eriu! I knew you’d come. I knew it!
 
ERIU	Get to Dag Dia in the forest. 

ÉREMON	EVELYN! 

EVIE	ERIU!
 
ÉREMON	I told you. I told you, Evelyn. Nothing. 

EVIE	No!
 
ÉREMON	Nothing. 

EVIE	No! No! ERIU! Dag Dia? 

DAIMHIN	Seems it’s just us left. Sorry you woke up alone. I just, I needed a moment to think. 

EVIE	Dag Dia? 

DAIMHIN	Daimhin is my birth name. But I do prefer Dag Dia. 

EVIE	I don’t know how to tell you this, but- Back at the camp...Eriu.

DAIMHIN	She was not harmed. She was carrying the Book of Healing. I’m afraid her plan was quite reckless. I’m so sorry for all you’ve had to endure so much since I brought you here, Evie.
 
EVIE	Why did you bring me here? There are so many people from my world who could've helped you so much more.  
DAIMHIN	It had to be you. 

EVIE	But that's ridiculous. Why?

DAIMHIN	I’m in enough trouble as it is for bringing you here. I should let her explain.
 
EVIE	“Her”, who? Who are you talking about? 

DAIMHIN	The Queen. Eriu sent her a message. 

EVIE	The Queen? I’m supposed to meet a Queen? Okay, this has got to stop! Eriu is most likely on her way to a Milesian dungeon because of me.
 
DAIMHIN	Eriu sacrificed herself so you could be here. 

EVIE	Bad move! Stupid move! I am not the kind of person you stand behind. I am the person you walk by without noticing. I’m a nobody from nowhere. Why can’t you understand that? 

QUEEN	He doesn’t understand that, because he carried you from this world as an infant, and he knows exactly where you’re from. 

EVIE	Your Majesty. 

QUEEN	I will deal with you later, Daimhin. 

EVIE	Why are you mad at Dag Dia? 

QUEEN	You shouldn’t be here, Evelyn. 

EVIE	I know. 

QUEEN	You’ve grown into such a lovely girl. I have to admit, I’m a bit nervous seeing you. 

EVIE	Why would you be nervous about meeting me? 

QUEEN	Mothers always wish their daughters to think kindly of them. I thought perhaps I might never see you again. You must have a lot of questions. In the heart of a great war, a Milesian warrior fell in love with the Danann princess. hey were married in secret by the Abbess, and soon the princess was with child. The warrior and the princess intended to expose their love. But then the war took a terrible turn, separating the two. After the tragic loss of her father, the princess suddenly became Queen. And the welfare of an entire race now fell to her. The Queen knew that the infant held a powerful secret, and many would seek to destroy her. So she called upon the Abbess to send her far away from harm, safe in the arms of her father. 

EVIE	My father is a Milesian?

QUEEN	Your father was wounded and had to flee from the vengeance of his own people. I miss him very much. That child has finally returned to Albion. And sadly, she has not been met with the welcome her mother dreamed she would one day receive.
 
EVIE	Did you ever miss me? 

QUEEN	A day has not passed that I have not yearned for you.  Giving you up was the worst moment of my life.
 
EVIE	You chose to leave me. That’s even worse than thinking you were dead. 

QUEEN	I do not blame you for your anger. 

EVIE	Good. Because it was really hard not having a mom. I mean, dad tried, but-
 
QUEEN	Evelyn...
 
EVIE	Evie. 

QUEEN	Evie... I am truly sorry.
 
EVIE	Why does Dag Dia think I can help you? 

QUEEN	In order to lift the spell of the barrier, all four Danann treasures must be brought together, and then both bloodlines must agree to end the treaty- 

EVIE	That’s me isn’t it? I have both bloodlines. I can do it without the Milesians agreeing. Even if I am who you say I am, that doesn’t mean I have what it takes to storm a fortress.
 
QUEEN	You will do no such thing.

EVIE	Molly was right; I’m just the stable girl. 

QUEEN	Evie. Eriu and the Abbess speak of a girl who is as generous as she is brave; as clever as she is honest. It takes a very special person to achieve that kind of balance. 

EVIE	My father said that too me. Can I try something? I just wanted to see what this would feel like. Mom? I'm scared.

QUEEN	Hush now, Don’t be scared Through this tide of darkness. 

EVIE	It was you. I remember.
 
QUEEN	Its an ancient Albion song. My mother sang it to me when I was frightened.
 
EEDER	Well, well. Which these Danann morsels am I going to eat first? 

E?REMON	My journey proved quite successful, my lord. 

EEDER	By the Gods! E?remon, for this you shall have a kingdom! Not as big as mine, kinda a little smaller, but even so. I can feel their energy pulsing through them as their spirits are reunited together. Fools! I will crush them! I fear nothing! Not even the tiny little mice who come to me at night with their nasty little sharp claws trying to touch my- Is this the truth stick?
 
ÉREMON	The Sceptor of Truth, yes.
 
EEDER	Right! Mount the treasures! Not the Cauldron! You want me to starve to death? Mount them up there on the wall so I can gaze on them as their makers are swept aside like drowning insects. 

ERIU	The Danann are a peaceful people, you disgusting toad! Have you no honor?! 

EEDER	I would like her beaten please. And then killed. 

ÉREMON	Of course my lord.
 
EEDER	And to make sure she's quite dead, beat her again. 

ÉREMON	We will be merciless, my lord. 

LI?R	I volunteer to be beaten in her place! 

ERIU	Be quiet, Li?r! 

LÍR	I will not! Look at this beautiful face. Is this not the face of a man who deserves to be beaten? I can’t imagine looking at your face The least you could do is have a few good swings at this masterpiece that stands before you. Why waste your time on beating this...imp?
 
ERIU	Do you really think I look like an imp?
 
LÍR	No, I just lied. It felt exhilarating. 

EEDER	Kill him! Kill him. Kill him! Kill. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	How dare you talk about our general like that! 

LÍR	Are you mad?
 
GALLGAIDHEAL	YES, I AM MAD!! Madly in love with my all powerful master! I curse the day that I was born Danann! I used to dream at night that I was Milesian. I have to admit, I used to draw the Milesian symbol on my chest and pretend I was one of you. I like the way you look. I like the way you smell. I even like the way you eat. I humble myself at your feet gracious lord. Use your great powers to strip away this Danann husk and I will serve you until the day I die. 

EEDER	I like this one! Give him a nice new tunic. They dare to call me merciless? Throw the other two in the dungeon. Public beating in the morning, followed by disembowelment. I want a nice crowd! And a band! A posh band! Lets have some fun, shall we? E?remon!
 
ÉREMON	Yes, my lord? 

EEDER	Did you dispose of my little premonition? 

E?REMON	Not yet, my lord. But soon. 

EEDER	A little girl escape my greatest warrior? 

E?REMON	She has not escaped me. 

EEDER	I do not like riddles, Éremon.
 
ÉREMON	We have her friends upon the knife, she will come to us, my lord.
 
EEDER	Oh, so she's a fool? 

ÉREMON	Even worse.
 
EEDER	Suicidal.
 
ÉREMON	Worse still. She's Brave. Selfless. With a disastrous faith. And tonight, it will be her undoing. 

EEDER	So be it. 

ÉREMON	My lord. 

QUEEN	In our darkest hour, we are truly blessed to have you as our champion. 

ÉREMON	The tunnel. 

EVIE	Can you look in on my dad every once in a while? Make sure he’s not too sad. 

QUEEN	There's a secret underground passage way. The same that Daimhin and Gallgaidheal used all those years ago. 

ERIU	We're turning. We only have a few hours left. 

LI?R	If we are to perish tonight, I feel I must share my feelings openly with you, openly. 

 ERIU	I don’t know that even now is the time-

LÍR	Hush. My scarlet beauty. Though you not as fair as I. I’m just being honest here.
 
ERIU	Move past this part swiftly.

LÍR	Of course. Where was I? “Though you are not as fair as I” ...Oh yes! Though you are not as fair as-
 
 LÍR	You know that part already-

ERIU	Yep. 

LÍR	You have always possessed a singularity that I have found... Quite intoxicating. You're not like any woman that I know. You do not fawn after me. Or send me gifts, or. Write me poems describing my- In short. You make me want to be...different…than I am. So that you...might favor me. 

ERIU	You don’t have to be different, Li?r. You might want to talk about 95% less, though.
 
LÍR	I can try.
 
EVIE	Good. You guys are so cute. 

ERIU	EVIE! Ya came!
 
LI?R	I’m excited, but Eriu was seconds away from kissing me so- 

 ERIU	Kiss you! He was about to kiss me!  -You were about to kiss me.

LÍR	Definitely leaning in- 

EVIE	Okay guys! Let's go!
 
ERIU	How did you even get in here-

EVIE	The passageway. She got your message. I’ll tell you everything later.

LÍR	We must be quiet, like mice. Much smaller mice. Much smaller. 

ERIU	Can we get some help in here? HEY!
 
LÍR	I can't believe I just did that. 

MISSING FINGER ATT	Halt! Where do you think you're going? 

ERIU	The General demanded we bring this prisoner to him, immediately.
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	Well I'll have to comfirm-

ERIU	No! Don’t comfirm. 

LÍR	No confirming. We’re suggesting that you don’t confirm.
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	And why exactly would I not?
 
ERIU	Well, tell him. 

LÍR	You shouldn’t comfirm…because. The general doesn’t... Like you. 

MISSING FINGER ATT	Ha ha ha! I’ll have you know, he spared my life just days ago! 

LÍR	Did he? Or did he just forget to kill you?
 
MISSING FINGER ATT	He just hates me, I don’t know what I did. Honestly.
 
LÍR	Perhaps he’ll feel better  once he’s had a bite to eat. He’s going to try and eat this one in a whole mouthful. Okay. Off we go. 


EEDER	Hot soup.

GALLGAIDHEAL	Know what few people realize is that once you’ve lived in the rectum of a whale for a few weeks, almost anything else seems interesting. Look at that slug. What's he doing? What's he thinking? What're his hobbies? 

 EEDER	My mother used to call me her little slug. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	That’s a cute nickname. 

EEDER	I poisoned her. I was only ten. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	I don't like nicknames either. Evie. 

EEDER	So, you came. E?remon was right after all. Like a moth to a huge flame. Tell me little grub. What are you?  Rain water. How strange. Your essence is as familiar to me as my own.Yet you are an alien. So, I’ll ask you again, what are you, succulent little lamb?
 
EVIE	I’m your granddaughter. 

EEDER	That’s absurd. Why would you tell these lies, when you know I will kill you for them? 

EVIE	Because they're not lies. Your son is my father. 

EEDER	My son is dead!
 
EVIE	He’s not. He’s alive. We’ve been living in Vermont. 

EEDER	Vermont!
 
ÉREMON	I knew there was a reason you could hear our thoughts, little girl. Seize them! Have you had your fill of the deeds of men, little girl? 

EVIE	You were right, actually. 

E?REMON	About our tragic race? 

EVIE	About me being disappointed in you. Hey, Jabba. 

EEDER	What did you call me?

GALLGAIDHEAL	He doesn't like nicknames.
 
EVIE	You didn’t ask who my mother was? 

EEDER	I do not care what urchin my son conspired with to create you. But I know she is Danann or your blood wouldn’t feel so muddled.

EVIE	Yes.  But not just any Danann. My mother is the Queen. That’s right. Both bloodlines On behalf of the Milesians and the Danann, I end this Treaty. Your reign ends right now! 

EEDER	You see your little world crumbling before you. Did you not remember that you have to have possession of the Treasures? Did you think you, a little girly, that you could really walk in here and take over and destory me? I AM A GENERAL!

ERIU	You demented madman! The Danann shall be free!
 
EVIE	Eriu! 

GALLGAIDHEAL	No! No! You keep your dirty Danann hands off my master!! He is good! He is benevolent!

EEDER	What are you doing?! Get off me, you fool!! Now, little girl. I want you to feel what it’s like to be torn in half. The cauldren! Where's the cauldren? What's happened to my cauldren? 

GALLGAIDHEAL	think it’s time to go, Evie.
 
EVIE	Gally! You’re amazing!

EEDER	There he is! Get him! 

ERIU	Did you see that coming?
 
LÍR	Nope.
 
EEDER	Get him, he's got my cauldron! 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Run Evie! Hot soup.

EEDER	Capture him, that double deserter! 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Very hot soup. 

EEDER	Damn you, double crossing rat! 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Extremely hot soup. 

LÍR	My gods! 

ERIU	Now that's a rescue. Evie! 

EEDER	Éremon! Kill her you useless rat of a man! 

ÉREMON	As I said. I give no man my love.
 
EEDER	No! No. No. No.

ÉREMON	My daughter was kind. And I believe she would have fought gladly along you. Evie.Now save your people.

EEDER	No. NO.

ÉREMON	Save us all. 

GALLGAIDHEAL	Evie. 




EVIE	You are a horrible man and an even worse ruler. You will no longer imprison the Danann. I end the treaty and release the barrier. 

EEDER	Releasing that barrier will only lead to another great war. One for which you are now entirely responsible. 

EVIE	Not if people don’t want to fight. 

EEDER	That's what men do, they fight  and they die! That's it! And we will start with your little tribe. Kill them. Kill them now! Kill them! 

ÉREMON	The first person who lays a hand on her, loses that hand. 

EEDER	You will answer for this with your bones, E?remon. 

E?REMON	Perhaps. But not today. 

EEDER	What are you doing here? What are you trolls doin-Guards! Go away! Go! Go away! This is my palace! You're not supposed to be here! GUARDS! 

ERIU	Evie!

QUEEN	We cannot begin to thank you for what you’ve achieved. We stand in the sun for the first time in so long because of your relentless courage. Our Treasures reunited and balanced once again. And a strong chance for peace. Now that E?remon has taken Eeder’s place on The Milesian throne. We are safe. For now. 

EVIE	When will see you again? 

QUEEN	Very soon.
 
EVIE	Will I be able to find my way back on my own? 

QUEEN	Keep your eyes open. When you happen upon a strikingly beautiful place in nature. A place that almost stops your breath. That is our two worlds touching. And in that place is the way to Albion. You are everything I could have ever dreamed you would become, my Evie. Please send my love to your father. Please send my love to your father. Waiting for you.
 
EVIE	Come on. Whoa. Whoa easy. 

BRIAN	Evie? Evie? Evie? Can you hear me? 

EVIE	Am I dead? Is this Heaven?
 
BRIAN	Does this smell like Heaven to you? You gave us quite a scare, Evie. We've been been worried sick about you, where've you been?

EVIE	I went into the woods...there was a horse- I mean a kelpie.

BRIAN	A what? 

EVIE	Dad?
 
CONNOR	..Evie.. I thought I'd lost you.

EVIE	I'm so sorry I worried you.

CONNOR	It’s okay. You’re safe. And you're here. That’s all that matters. 

EVIE	Mother sends her love.
 
CONNOR	We have a lot to talk about, don't we. 

EVIE	We do. You're walking. Can’t have courage without a little fear, right? 

ERIU	Is she going to be alright?

CONNOR	Yes. 

BRIAN	Evie, I'd like you to meet our new riding instructor. 

ERIU	Pleasure to meet you, Evie. 

EVIE	Yeah.
 
BRIAN	And how about this stallion, huh? Isn't he a beauty? 

EVIE	Yeah.
 
CONNOR	Once again.
