(THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL 7)


WITCH	Where is the Seal?!

PETER THE FIRST	Help me up. For your information, people have been trying poison me right from my birth, so now there is no poison that affects me. Get us up if you don’t want me to kill her.

SPIRID	Sirko, help! A bit more, Sirko!

WITCH SERVANT	Oh my incomparable princess, we are finished! The forces are running out, the rebels will soon take over the palace… and they have defeated the magicians!

ZHONG ZHE	Let her go!

WITCH SERVANT	What should we do, my princess? What should we do?

PETER THE FIRST	I've already actually shaved today.

WITCH SERVANT	I have a plan. As I already said, we should run!

WITCH	You're right. Go gather up all the gold. Kill him now!

ZHONG HAO	Zhong Zhe, no! She is not Cheng Lan! She’s the Witch!

WITCH	What are you waiting for? I said kill him!

ZHONGYI	Zhong Zhe, trust us! We are your brothers!

WITCH SERVANT	Gold, gold! My precious gold!

WITCH	Stand by your oath! What are you waiting for? Kill him now!

ZHONGYI	Don't listen to her! 

ZHONGHAO	You swore your oath to Chen Lang, not this witch!

ZHONG ZHE	Is it true? And are you not the real Chen Lang?

WITCH	Don’t listen to them! I am Cheng Lan!

ZHON YI	Zhong Zhe! Zhong Zhe! No!

WITCH SERVANT	Finally, you’ll be mine, Your Majesty!

WITCH	You're too heavy. The boat can't carry the two of us!

WITCH SERVANT	Noooo!


PETER THE FIRST	Definitely, a witch...

WITCH	So long, fools! 

MAIDSERVANT	Mistress! Mistress!

WITCH SERVANT	My princess, my sun! Our Mistress needs our help! 

CHENG LAN	I’ll take your mask off!

WITCH	And I will take the Dragon Seal away from you!

CHENG LAN	You are not worthy of this seal! It only goes to those chosen by the dragon!

REBELS	The Dragon is free!

MISS DUDLEY	Look!

JONATHAN GREEN	Let’s go! This way! Quickly!

CHENG LAN	Stop it! Spare yourself the humiliation! Maybe people will forgive you! How are you doing this?

WITCH	Take the Seal away from her! I don't need you anymore!

MAIDSERVANT	Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

REBEL	Come!

WITCH	Perfect timing… She is the impostor! Take her away!

PETER THE FIRST	What did she say? This is the true princess! I gave her the seal myself! Then, this is the fraud!

CHENG LAN	That’s an impostor!  She’s not the real princess!

WITCH	Silence her!

MISS DUDLEY	Here is your Cheng!

JONATHAN GREEN	Wait, wait! Don't hurt her. She is Chen Lang.  He recognized her! He can't be wrong! She is my friend!  She is the real Princess! 

MISS DUDLEY	Please, don’t die Jonathan! Not when I’ve just found you! Please, look, don’t die!

WITCH	You silly foreigners! Now I control the power of the Seal! And I am the Chosen! Dragon! Come to me! I command you to fly to me! I command you! I command you! I have the Se…Nasty creature! Dragon, I command you, I command you to save me! No! No, no!



MISS DUDLEY	Please, don't die, Jonathan! Your son is waiting for you! 

JONATHAN GREEN	My son?

MISS DUDLEY	Yes! You have a son! Please... Please, don't die! No!

DANIEL	Hurrah!

LORD DUDLEY	Hop! Hop! Fight! Hop!

DANIEL	Now you have to defend!

LORD DUDLEY	Fight! Hop! Hop! Fight with me, Daniel! Fight with me! Fight with me, Daniel! Hop! Oh, a pigeon! Dear father please forgive the smudged writing… I've been crying so much in the last few days. I cry... From happiness… Finally I've found him!

JONATHAN GREEN	You saved my life!

MISS DUDLEY	That’s true.

LORD DUDLEY	The one person who could really help us right now is the Master. The one who is jailed in the Tower. I ask you to employ all of your influence to arrange for his release, so that he can return to China as soon as possible...

JAMES HOOK	By the will of Her Majesty, you are now free. It’s unfortunate to lose you already, because I’ve just started to learn about your art.

MASTER	You are the strongest opponent I've ever had.

JAMES HOOK	Free him! Oh, by the way. Lord Dudley mentioned something about “a dragon is free”?

MASTER	Come with me to China. I will show you everything.

CHENG LAN	Did you really swear you were going to protect her for the entire rest of your life?

ZHONGZHE	Yes, but I thought she was you.

CHENG LAN	It's a pity I did not hear it. If you swore it, protect me!

MASTER	You see, it wasn't the seal that gave power over the Dragon. It was love. He sees our hearts. He knows who is good and he helps people with pure intentions. That's why he gave us the healing tea! So, that’s it for today. Go study!

TRAINER	Get ready…Start! One! Two!

MASTER	I’m so happy you’ve finally got out of your prison.

JAMES HOOK	Well... Where is the Dragon?  I left the Tower to come all the way over here to see the Dragon.

MASTER	He’s here, he’s everywhere. He’s always among us.

JAMES HOOK	But where?

MASTER	Look! He’s everywhere. He is in the mountains, the sea… and the sky above us!
