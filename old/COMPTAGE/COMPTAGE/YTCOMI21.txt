(LONDON)
storyteller	ever since thomas the tank engine arrived on the island of sodor, he had always wanted to see the world.
storyteller	and one day...
storyteller	...he saw his chance!
storyteller	thomas and friends. really useful around the world!
storyteller	thomas in london!
storyteller	thomas had arrived in the city of london. he was very excited because earlier that day...
storyteller	...an important-looking man had given him an exciting message!
storyteller	"welcome to london, thomas," he said. "today you are going to be collecting a very special passenger."
storyteller	but thomas didn't know who the special passenger was going to be.
storyteller	at the next station, thomas collected a passenger who looked very special. he was wearing gold chains of office and strange robes. 
storyteller	it was the lord mayor of london! thomas wondered – was he the special passenger? 
storyteller	at the next station, thomas picked up... a goat!
storyteller	surely he wasn't the special passenger?!
storyteller	the goat turned out to belong to some soldiers. he was very special to them – he was their mascot!
storyteller	then thomas wondered whether one of the soldiers was his special passenger?
storyteller	when thomas weeshed into the next station, there was a large crowd and he picked up yet another very important passenger.
storyteller	thomas's mind boggled! "london is full of very special people," he said. "even a very special goat!"
storyteller	and thomas was right. london was full of special people. so many, in fact...
storyteller	...that he didn't even notice...
storyteller	...the real special passenger!
