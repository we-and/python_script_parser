EISSA	That's my dad...
EISSA	Always picking up strangers.
EISSA	But this man was different. 
EISSA	He asked to be dropped off at Exit 77. 
EISSA	A road to nowhere. 
EISSA	Before leaving, the man passed along a warning
ADAM	Beware the Black Flags.
ADAM	Their only loyalty is to themselves.
EISSA	He advised my father to gather up supplies and flee.
EISSA	Find somewhere safe and secluded. Hide out there...
EISSA	And above all, stay guarded.
EISSA	So that's exactly what we did.
EISSA	The Seer. That's what my father called the man.
EISSA	Since he foresaw the end.
EISSA	After that...
EISSA	The Black Flags and other paramilitary groups began battling one another for supremacy.
EISSA	Everything in sight was gutted and burned, then left to rot.
EISSA	Those who avoided getting murdered in the streets...
EISSA	Frequently wound up either starving or freezing to death inside their homes.
EISSA	One thing all of these people had in common:
EISSA	They died afraid.
EISSA	Cold, hungry, and afraid.
EISSA	Then things got even worse.
EISSA	One of the remaining paramilitary groups succeeded in contaminating the water supply.
EISSA	A single drop had the capacity to destroy your entire immune system.
EISSA	That's when all hell broke loose.
EISSA	Entire cities were erased from existence. 
EISSA	That's why I'm telling you to forget it.
EISSA	My dad won't let you near her.
DAOUD	I can't accept that.
DAOUD	I'm going to talk to him.
DAOUD	Man to man.
DAOUD	You don't think I'll do it?
EISSA	Checkmate.
DAOUD	I wasn't paying attention. New game.
DAOUD	Come on play again!
EISSA	I only saw one.
SHUAIB	Get back up there.
SHUAIB	Be ready to give me cover.
JAMAL	Shuaib!
SHUAIB	Now is not the time, Jamal.
MARYAM	I'm coming with you.
SHUAIB	No you're not.
MARYAM	Father. 
SHUAIB 	Maryam!
MARYAM	Stop treating me like a child.
MARYAM	I can help out there.
SHUAIB	I know, sweetheart.
SHUAIB	No one here is more capable than you.
SHUAIB	That's why I need you to stay inside and look after the others.
SHUAIB	Two knocks, we're clear.
MARYAM	Three, there's a problem.
SHUAIB	She's sick.
QAIS	From the water.
TEEN GIRL	Please help me.
QAIS	I don't like this.
SHUAIB	Come here.
SHUAIB	-Come here! 
QAIS	Wait...
QAIS	It's a trap.
SHUAIB	She's my daughter's age, damn it.
QAIS	Shuaib, don't unlock the gate.
TEEN GIRL	Please help me.
TEEN GIRL	Or just kill me.
SHUAIB	I have to try.
SHUAIB	Hold this.
EISSA	What are you doing, Dad?
DAOUD	Don't worry. He can handle himself.
DAOUD	Just cover him.
QAIS	Shuaib!
SHUAIB	Shut the gate the second I'm back in.
QAIS	Shuaib...
RAED	"Five girls near the water spring."
RAED	"Only one's the love for me."
RAED	"Five girls near the water spring."
RAED	"Three are gone and two remain."
RAED	If I were you...
RAED	I'd stay put.
RAED	Lower your gun.
SHUAIB	Give me the girl.
RAED	Lower your gun, buddy.
SHUAIB	The girl.
RAED	I won't ask you again!
RAED	Now drop it.
SHUAIB	It stays in my hand. 
RAED	What name do you go by?
SHUAIB	None of your business.
SHUAIB	Who are you with?
RAED	None of your business.
SHUAIB	They call me Abu Eissa.
RAED	And I'm...
RAED	A drifter.
RAED	Affiliated with no one.
SHUAIB	So what brings you here?
SHUAIB	What do you want?
RAED	Water.
RAED	I need water. 
SHUAIB	I'll give you a gallon.
SHUAIB	You give me the girl.
RAED	I must say...
RAED	That's very generous of you.
RAED	All that beautiful water you've got up there.
RAED	And the most you can spare is a gallon?
RAED	That just won't do.
SHUAIB	It's not only for me.
RAED	What if I throw in a little gift besides her?
SHUAIB	What?
RAED	I've got bullets.
RAED	As many as you want.
SHUAIB	9 millimeter?
RAED	No.
RAED	I've got...
RAED	.22s
SHUAIB	How about 762s?
RAED	Afraid not.
RAED	But I do have...
RAED	Chill out, Abu Eissa! Relax a little.
RAED	I told you, it's a gift. 
DAOUD	Wait.
RAED	I've got these.
RAED	Very useful.
RAED	Don't need a weapon to trigger them.
RAED	Any sort of pin or nail will do.
RAED	They create catastrophes.
SHUAIB	I have no need for them.
SHUAIB	Listen to me.
SHUAIB	I'll give you three gallons of water.
SHUAIB	You give me the girl.
SHUAIB	And you and your friends never come back here.
SHUAIB	You don't need their permission.
SHUAIB	This is just between us.
RAED	You're right.
RAED	It's just between us.
QAIS	Shuaib! Get back here!
EISSA	Can't get a mark on either of them!
RAED	Fire!
DAOUD	On the truck!
QAIS	Shuaib!
RAED	Khaled?
RAED	Gabba?
EISSA	Come on, Dad. Move!
RAED	Have them throw down their weapons or I'll blow...
SHUAIB	You okay?
MUSSA	Don't shoot!
MUSSA	I was just passing through.
MUSSA	Heard you fighting.
MUSSA	Chose your side.
SHUAIB	And what brought you here?
MUSSA	I was looking for shelter.
MUSSA	There are bandits everywhere.
MUSSA	I was just hoping to find some good people.
SHUAIB	Are you alone?
MUSSA	Gülbin!
SHUAIB	Anyone else?
MUSSA	It's just the two of us.
MUSSA	You mind if I get my knife?
MUSSA	Have you said hello to the guys that shot me?
MUSSA	Gülbin doesn't speak any Arabic.
MUSSA	She's Kurdish, and my Kurdish isn't so good.
MUSSA	But somehow we manage to communicate.
EISSA	Dad!
SHUAIB	It's alright.
EISSA	You're not hurt?
SHUAIB	Had you more accuracy you might have killed my benefactor here.
EISSA	I thought he was with...
SHUAIB	I know what you thought.
SHUAIB	It's okay.
SHUAIB	My name is Shuaib.
SHUAIB	That's Qais.
MUSSA	Name's Mussa.
EISSA	You saved my father?
EISSA	Thank you.
SHUAIB	Please come in.
SHUAIB	We can clean up your wound at least.
SHUAIB	My son here was captain of his football team.
SHUAIB	Top scorer two years running.
MUSSA	God bless him!
MUSSA	I'm sorry for your losses.
SHUAIB	We are all on this same path.
SHUAIB	Bury the girl first thing tomorrow.
SHUAIB	Blood's not mine, don't worry.
SHUAIB	Mussa.
SHUAIB	This is my daughter Maryam.
MUSSA	Hello.
SHUAIB	Daoud...
SHUAIB	Draws.
DAOUD	Graphic design and animation, actually.
DAOUD	Did some work for TV.
SHUAIB	Draws.
SHUAIB	Zaineb. Bilal.
SHUAIB	We have guests.
MUSSA	I'm Mussa. This is Gülbin.
ZAINEB	Hey.
BILAL	Welcome.
ZAINEB	The palace is vast. Make yourselves comfortable.
MUSSA	What is this place?
SHUAIB	Used to be an airplane wings factory.
MUSSA	How long have you been here?
SHUAIB	318 days.
EISSA	Is everything alright?
SHUAIB	You've got something to say.
EISSA	Mussa.
EISSA	He should stay with us.
SHUAIB	Just Mussa?
SHUAIB	Eissa.
SHUAIB	We barely know these people.
SHUAIB	We don't know this man or his vices.
EISSA	He saved your life.
EISSA	What more do you need to know?
SHUAIB	Still. We have to be careful.
SHUAIB	The world isn't what it used to be.
EISSA	Being careful didn't stop mum getting sick from the water.
SHUAIB	I did all I could to save her.
EISSA	We need a better plan than just being careful.
SHUAIB	That's what The Seer told us to do, and I have faith in God.
EISSA	You rely on God, yet you won't plan for the future.
EISSA	We need to take control of our destiny,
EISSA	not throw ourselves in the quagmire and accept it as our fate.
SHUAIB	That's enough.
EISSA	You have to understand that...
SHUAIB	I said that's enough! 
MUSSA	Only Kurdish, I'm afraid.
SHUAIB	You've done me a favor and I appreciate it.
SHUAIB	You're welcome to stay for a couple of nights. But that's all.
SHUAIB	Unless you have nowhere else to go.
SHUAIB	There are conditions if you stay.
SHUAIB	You carry out duties around here just like I ask.
MUSSA	Isn't it customary to let guests eat and rest before asking them to make such decisions?
MUSSA	Please. 
SHUAIB	How did you two meet?
MUSSA	I found her in a deserted neighborhood.
MUSSA	She'd been hiding out there for months, ever since her husband died.
MUSSA	Murdered actually.
MUSSA	We've stayed together ever since.
MUSSA	It must have been fate that brought us together.
MUSSA	Don't you think?
MARYAM	How was he murdered? Did she tell you?
MUSSA	He was torn apart.
MUSSA	Limb from limb.
MUSSA	Pulled from his body.
MUSSA	By a group of self-proclaimed "soldiers"...
MUSSA	Who decided he wasn't worthy of living.
MUSSA	By some miracle, Gülbin managed to escape.
MUSSA	Fortunately, I was the one who eventually found her.
RAYA	I consider my scars a sign of beauty. 
RAYA	Could you translate?
RAYA	I was a teacher.
RAYA	When it all started.
RAYA	We were taken hostage at our school.
RAYA	A rebel commander started groping one of the teachers.
RAYA	So I attacked him.
RAYA	Three other rebels came in.
RAYA	They raped me.
RAYA	Then they poured acid on my face.
RAYA	But I survived.
RAYA	If I had known this was the price I'd to pay  to remain alive, I'd do the same thing again...  A thousand times.
IDREES	I'm a theatre director. Or, rather...
IDREES	I was.
IDREES	In the old world.
IDREES	I used to teach my students to empower themselves with love in order to gain confidence on stage.
IDREES	If just one of my students were still with us.
IDREES	To see Raya.
IDREES	A shining example...
IDREES	Of a person armed with nothing but love.
IDREES	Who somehow channeled it to fight against all the brutality and hatred out there.
IDREES	Of course I fell in love with her.
IDREES	She kindly loved me back.
IDREES	And after a great deal of pleading and all sorts diplomatic efforts...
IDREES	Our dear friend Shuaib...
IDREES	Finally agreed to marry us off in front of God and His witnesses.
MARYAM	There's something very strange going on here. 
SHUAIB	What are you talking about? 
MARYAM	Gülbin is afraid of Mussa. 
SHUAIB	How do you know that?
MARYAM	Just watch her. She's always frightened and nervous when he's around. 
MARYAM	There's something off about Mussa. 
MARYAM	I don't like him. Or the way he stares at everyone. 
EISSA	He saved Dad's life. 
MARYAM	I know. But we still have to be careful. 
EISSA	We owe him an invitation to stay here.
MARYAM	Do you even know the man?! 
EISSA	It's the right thing to do! 
MARYAM	We've done more than enough for them already. I say we... 
SHUAIB	Maryam. 
SHUAIB	Mussa has until tomorrow to decidewhether or not he wants to stay. 
MARYAM	Well, what if Gülbin wants to stay, but is too scared to say so? 
SHUAIB	You two get some rest. 
SHUAIB	We'll have our answers tomorrow. 
SHUAIB	Goodnight. 
JAMAL	The knife. 
MARYAM	Can you explain to me why you trust this guy so much?
EISSA	Can you explain to me why you're such a know-it-all? 
MARYAM	As if you know anything. 
MARYAM	Idiot. 
EISSA	Call me an idiot again and I'll tell Dad about you and Daoud. 
MARYAM	Seriously? 
MARYAM	What are we, children?
EISSA	You started it.
EISSA	And you know I'd never tell Dad. 
SHUAIB	I hope you liked the food. 
MUSSA	Best I've had in a while. 
MUSSA	Brought me back to the good old days. 
SHUAIB	Are you more comfortable keeping this knife on you? 
MUSSA	Does it make you uncomfortable? 
SHUAIB	Not really. But as you can see...
SHUAIB	We all keep our weapons inside this cabinet.
SHUAIB	Which stays locked unless there's a problem.
SHUAIB	I'm the only one with a key.
SHUAIB	I don't carry a gun. I'm sure you've noticed. 
MUSSA	What goes for everyone else here... 
MUSSA	Goes for me too. 
MUSSA	No.
MUSSA	No.
MUSSA	You're testing me.
SHUAIB	Not at all.
MUSSA	Yes you are.
MUSSA	Because you don't know me.
MUSSA	You see, this knife and I are old friends.
MUSSA	Friends for life, as a matter of fact. 
MUSSA	So what's it gonna be fearless leader?
MUSSA	Do you trust me to keep this knife under my pillow?
MUSSA	Or am I the one who has to trust you?
MUSSA	And the next thing I know you'll be killing me and Gülbin in our sleep.
SHUAIB	If I had the slightest intention of killing you...
SHUAIB	I'd hardly have fed you dinner.
MUSSA	Unless you wanted to fatten us up like goats before the slaughter.
MUSSA	Ain't that right?
SHUAIB	No it's not.
SHUAIB	And I don't mean to make a test out of this...
MUSSA	It's already done.
SHUAIB	Listen to me, Mussa.
SHUAIB	Unless you've already made up your mind to settle down here...
SHUAIB	You are still a guest under my roof.
SHUAIB	And as far as I know, guests are expected to abide by the rules of the house.
SHUAIB	Your knife...
SHUAIB	Goes into the cabinet with the other weapons.
SHUAIB	And that's final.
MUSSA	I'm just fucking with you, man! Can't you take a joke?
MUSSA	This knife...
MUSSA	Is my dearest belonging.
MUSSA	You honestly call yourself a leader of this pack of dumbfucks?
MUSSA	Trust should not simply be given.
MUSSA	It should be earned.
MUSSA	Now I know where you keep your food, your water and your weapons.
MUSSA	Goodbye now...
MUSSA	Fearless leader.
MUSSA	The unworthy.
MUSSA	I am the Aleph and the Ya'a.
MUSSA	The beginning and the end.
MUSSA	The time has come to separate the strong from the weak.
MUSSA	The Worthy...
MUSSA	From the unworthy.
EISSA	Qais.
MARYAM	Dad.
GÜLBIN	No!
RAYA	Let go of her!
MARYAM	Get me something... 
MARYAM	A bandage, towel, anything! Daoud...
MARYAM	No.
EISSA	Stay awake.
EISSA	We're right here with you.
SHUAIB	Maryam.
SHUAIB	Eissa.
SHUAIB	I'm sorry.
EISSA	No. No. No.
JAMAL	See what happens when you let strangers in?
MARYAM	This is all your fault.
EISSA	Daoud.
ZAINEB	Eissa dear. Wait.
DAOUD	Eissa!
EISSA	Where are you?
EISSA	Come out, you bastard!
EISSA	Come out!
EISSA	Get out of the way.
EISSA	Move! 
MARYAM	Where do you think you're going?
EISSA	What?
EISSA	What's the matter with you?
EISSA	What's the matter with all of you?
EISSA	What's going on?
EISSA	Don't you realize who just got killed?
EISSA	Have you all forgotten who saved you?
EISSA	Where are you now?
EISSA	Where are you?!
MARYAM	You're not going anywhere.
EISSA	 I'm gonna kill him  
MARYAM	Not tonight. 
EISSA	I'm gonna kill him!
MARYAM	Not tonight you're not!
MARYAM	We need to see to Dad.
DAOUD	Don't worry.
DAOUD	Mussa must be gone by now.
DAOUD	You should get some sleep.
MARYAM	I'm okay.
MARYAM	Stay.
DAOUD	May he rest in peace.
MARYAM	What are we going to do now? 
EISSA	I don't know.
EISSA	What were we doing before?
EISSA	My father found a way to keep us safe.
EISSA	But he didn't plan for the future.
MARYAM	Do you really think he ran away?
EISSA	Mussa?
EISSA	I don't know...
MARYAM	I didn't mean what I said yesterday.
MARYAM	It's not your fault.
QAIS	You're a good man, Eissa.
EISSA	Father would have laughed hearing you say that.
QAIS	The world was falling apart all around us,
QAIS	but your dad still made sure everyone knew you were team captain.
EISSA	I meant the "man" part.
EISSA	He never treated me like one.
QAIS	It's men's work you're doing now.
QAIS	The people inside here are relying on you and your sister.
QAIS	And so am I. 
QAIS	I'm only alive today thanks to your dad.
QAIS	Consider me your right hand from now on.
QAIS	May he rest in peace.
EISSA	May he rest in peace.
EISSA	What?
EISSA	I'll wash them later.
MARYAM	What's wrong?
EISSA	What happened to the water?
MARYAM	What do you mean?
EISSA	We're fucked.
EISSA	Water's been cut.
EISSA	Gotta go out to the tower.
MARYAM	I'll go with you.
EISSA	No.
MARYAM	I won't let you go out there alone!
EISSA	Daoud, Qais, let's go.
QAIS	What's wrong?
EISSA	We're going to the water tower.
IDREES	Stay here, Qais. 
IDREES	I'll go.
EISSA	Fine.
MARYAM	Eissa.
EISSA	It's not gonna happen.
EISSA	One of us has to stay here.
MARYAM	Fine.
MARYAM	You still upset with me?
EISSA	Don't forget to lock up behind us.
EISSA	Two knocks we're clear.
MARYAM	Three there's trouble. 
MARYAM	Don't worry. 
DAOUD	Should we make a run for it?
EISSA	It won't make a difference.
EISSA	Save your energy.
EISSA	Just be ready.
EISSA	Hold this.
IDREES	Eissa, wait.
IDREES	Let me climb.
EISSA	You don't have to.
IDREES	Yes. I do.
IDREES	Carry your weight. That's what your father always said.
IDREES	This one...
IDREES	is mine.
IDREES	Just need a little hand here, boys.
DAOUD	Idrees.
DAOUD	Be careful.
EISSA	Idrees!
EISSA	Daoud.
EISSA	Daoud!
QAIS	Maryam, wait!
QAIS	Calm down, Daoud.
MARYAM	We have to stop the bleeding.
BILAL	Is this what Mussa was talking about?
BILAL	Separating the weak from the strong?
ZAINEB	What kind of test is this? What's he going do to us?
JAMAL	It's not a fucking test.
JAMAL	It's a massacre.
MARYAM	This isn't working. Hand me your belt.
MARYAM	Water.
ZAINEB	There's none left.
BILAL	And what if he comes back?
JAMAL	Where do you think you're going?
JAMAL	What are you hiding from us?
JAMAL	Tell me! What are you hiding?!
EISSA	Shut up!
EISSA	Everybody shut up.
EISSA	If anyone here does so much as raise a hand to anyone else, they're gone. Understood?
JAMAL	Why are you so eager to let her stay?
EISSA	She hasn't given us a reason not to.
MARYAM	Eissa!
MARYAM	Now is not the time.
JAMAL	What a joke.
MARYAM	The bleeding won't stop.
EISSA	Get a fire going.
QAIS	Hold him down.
EISSA	Just stay calm.
EISSA	Bilal, give us a hand here.
EISSA	Relax, we're right here with you.
EISSA	Hold him still.
DAOUD	Eissa!
DAOUD	Please don't!
MARYAM	Daoud!
DAOUD	I beg you!
DAOUD	I beg you!
EISSA	Cover his eyes.
DAOUD	Please! I'm begging you!
JAMAL	Above the knee.
JAMAL	Trust me.
EISSA	Hold him still.
MARYAM	Jamal...
MARYAM	You're pathetic.
MARYAM	Save some for Daoud.
JAMAL	I know you don't want to hear this, but...
JAMAL	We can't stay here any longer.
JAMAL	And Daoud is in no condition to be moved.
JAMAL	He lost a lot of blood.
JAMAL	Priority should go to those of us who are going to live.
MARYAM	What makes you so sure you're going to live?
JAMAL	Are you threatening me?
JAMAL	Aren't we all going to die?
MARYAM	I'm saying you're selfish.
JAMAL	Exactly.
JAMAL	Selfishness is what it's going to take from now on, sweetheart.
JAMAL	These petty and childish emotions of yours won't get us through a single week without water.
JAMAL	Get the hell off me!
EISSA	What did I say, Jamal?
JAMAL	She attacked me!
JAMAL	But you didn't see that, did you?
EISSA	I heard the whole thing.
JAMAL	So what?
JAMAL	Who put you in charge?
EISSA	Get out.
JAMAL	So you're giving out orders now, too.
EISSA	You're not welcome here anymore. 
EISSA	In here, we protect each other.
EISSA	Defend each other.
EISSA	You want to fight for yourself, do it out there.
JAMAL	Do you really think...
JAMAL	You'll last a day here without me?
JAMAL	Huh?
EISSA	Get out.
JAMAL	What if I don't want to?
EISSA	Leave now!
JAMAL	We're no longer under your command, Captain.
JAMAL	I think we can all agree that it's more rational for me to be in charge.
JAMAL	Not a kid just hatched from his egg.
JAMAL	First thing I'm doing is...
JAMAL	Throwing this bitch out of here.
EISSA	Don't you dare touch her. 
JAMAL	Get out!
JAMAL	Stay back, Eissa!
JAMAL	I'm doing this is for the good of everyone here.
EISSA	You're not a leader. You'll never be a leader, and you know it.
JAMAL	What do you know?
JAMAL	Do you know...
JAMAL	That your father took my council in everything.
JAMAL	Do any of you know...
JAMAL	That I was the real decision maker.
EISSA	A true leader has to protect his charges.
EISSA	Can you do that?
JAMAL	Is that so?
JAMAL	Who have you been able to protect?
JAMAL	Certainly not your own father.
JAMAL	Where were you when he got slaughtered right in front of everyone?
JAMAL	Who welcomed the enemy in here with open arms?
JAMAL	Didn't you insist on letting them stay?
EISSA	And you? Have you forgotten how you got here?
EISSA	The man who left his family behind to burn?
JAMAL	Shut up, Eissa.
EISSA	Yet somehow managed to save his books. Wasn't that you?
JAMAL	If you take one more step, I'll blow your brains out.
EISSA	You're not a leader.
EISSA	You never were.
EISSA	And my dad knew it.
JAMAL	Why are you all looking at me like that?
JAMAL	Are you going to let this boy call the shots?
JAMAL	For what good reason?
JAMAL	Because he's Shuaib's son?
JAMAL	I knew it had no bullets. I just wanted to scare him.
BILAL	We're staying with you, Eissa.
ZAINEB	Don't you worry about us, Jamal.
ZAINEB	You just look after yourself.
JAMAL	And then there were seven.
QAIS	What's that supposed to mean?
JAMAL	You took the bait.
JAMAL	Mussa is going to come for you. One by one.
JAMAL	He'll trap you like mice.
JAMAL	Just wait.
JAMAL	You'll be crawling out of this hole looking for water at any moment now.
JAMAL	I'll be seeing you again soon.
JAMAL	Very soon.
EISSA	Think we did the right thing?
QAIS	I think Mussa's plan is working.
EISSA	Maryam.
EISSA	Jamal's right.
EISSA	We can't survive here without water.
MARYAM	What about Daoud?
EISSA	It's going to be hard to take him with us.
MARYAM	So what do we do?
EISSA	We need a plan.
EISSA	We have no choice but to look for water.
EISSA	But I bet that's exactly what Mussa wants us to do.
EISSA	We need to be prepared for that.
EISSA	If it's a war he wants...
EISSA	Then a war is what he'll get.
MARYAM	We're doing the right thing.
MARYAM	We have no choice.
EISSA	Ready?
QAIS	Ready.
GÜLBIN	Eissa.
RAYA	I'm coming with you.
EISSA	What? 
MARYAM	You don't have to do this.
RAYA	Yes, actually, I do.
BILAL	Maryam.
BILAL	We're dead tired.
BILAL	Somebody mind taking over the watch?
MARYAM	I can't leave Daoud.
 BILAL	Can we trust her?
ZAINEB	Haven't we been doing so already?
ZAINEB	Let's go.
EISSA	Get over here.
EISSA	The canister.
QAIS	The gate's open!
QAIS	Raya.
EISSA	Raya!
EISSA	Raya!
EISSA	Are you okay?
QAIS	Are you hurt?
RAYA	Jamal is here.
EISSA	Raya!
EISSA	Say something!
EISSA	Can you see a way out?
EISSA	It's a trap.
RAYA	We can't leave him here.
EISSA	Why didn't Mussa just kill him?
QAIS	He wants to use him for something.
EISSA	For what? Bait?
EISSA	To get us in here?
QAIS	Only one way to find out.
EISSA	Jamal!
EISSA	What happened?
QAIS	He cut out his tongue.
RAYA	I just heard something.
EISSA	Jamal! Keep quiet!
RAYA	Dear God, what...
QAIS	Raya, find us a wrap of some sort.
EISSA	Shut up, for God's sake!
EISSA	Calm down!
QAIS	Eissa.
QAIS	We can't take him with us.
QAIS	We'll be done for if we drag him along.
EISSA	We're not leaving him like this.
EISSA	Hold him down.
EISSA	Hold him!
RAYA	What are you doing?
RAYA	What are you doing?!
EISSA	Forgive me, Jamal.
EISSA	Hurry! The fire's spreading fast!
RAYA	Open it!
QAIS	It's getting closer!
QAIS	Push!
EISSA	Out of the way!
RAYA	Hurry.
RAYA	Hurry!
EISSA	Give me a hand here.
RAYA	Come on, Eissa!
RAYA	Help me.
EISSA	Raya!
EISSA	Give me your hand!
RAYA	Eissa!
EISSA	Get closer!
EISSA	Raya!
EISSA	Raya!
DAOUD	Maryam. 
MARYAM	Yes?
DAOUD	Can I have some water?
MARYAM	We don't have any. I'm sorry
MARYAM	Bilal?
MUSSA	Maryam.
MUSSA	Your time has come.
EISSA	Gülbin!
GÜLBIN	Mar...
GÜLBIN	Maryam.
EISSA	Stay with her. 
QAIS	Where are you going?
MUSSA	You're the only one who can save her.
EISSA	What the hell do you want from me?
MUSSA	I want you to forget the old world.
MUSSA	Abandon the rules that only existed to force billions of people to live in mediocrity.
MUSSA	Think about all the chaos.
MUSSA	Chaos...
MUSSA	Is the greatest gift humanity has ever received.
EISSA	You have no right to speak for humanity.
MUSSA	Don't you get it?
MUSSA	The Earth was choking to death on useless people.
MUSSA	Worthless people.
MUSSA	Without purpose.
MUSSA	My task...
MUSSA	Is to help you understand this...
MUSSA	The choice is yours.
MUSSA	Which one of you gets to live?
MUSSA	Decide.
EISSA	Maryam!
EISSA	Don't worry!
MUSSA	You're free now, Eissa.
MUSSA	This is the end.
MUSSA	As well as the beginning.
MUSSA	Right before I cut out Jamal's tongue...
MUSSA	He told me the gun has no bullets. 
EISSA	How do you know he wasn't lying? 
EISSA	Unworthy.
EISSA	Where's Qais?
GÜLBIN	He was a good soldier. But his mission is over.
GÜLBIN	Intelligent.
GÜLBIN	But not a leader.
GÜLBIN	We don't need more followers.
EISSA	Why?!
GÜLBIN	You deserve to live. More than any of the others.
GÜLBIN	Mussa is supposed to light the fire...
GÜLBIN	While I stay back and watch.
GÜLBIN	Who takes charge...
GÜLBIN	And who waits for others to guide them.
GÜLBIN	Those who manage to control the situation get to join us.
GÜLBIN	Truth is, very few succeed.
GÜLBIN	But I had faith in you. And you didn't disappoint.
GÜLBIN	You passed the test.
EISSA	Only after he murdered my family.
GÜLBIN	Because they were weak.
GÜLBIN	Now the choice is yours.
GÜLBIN	When I let you go...
GÜLBIN	You can try to kill me.
GÜLBIN	Or you can come with me.
GÜLBIN	We're gathering soon in the Medina.
GÜLBIN	Join us.
GÜLBIN	Meet the others.
GÜLBIN	Let's fix this broken world together.
GÜLBIN	You're safe now.
GÜLBIN	My mission isn't over.
GÜLBIN	I have to go.
GÜLBIN	We'll be waiting for you.
GÜLBIN	It's where it all begins again. 
ADAM	It was them, wasn't it?
EISSA	Who are they?
ADAM	The Ya'a Aleph.
EISSA	I don't know what that means.
ADAM	The Aleph and the Ya'a.
ADAM	The first and the last.
ADAM	The beginning and the end.
ADAM	Ya'a.
ADAM	Aleph.
ADAM	The end...
ADAM	And then the beginning.
ADAM	That was our name.
ADAM	And our symbol. 
EISSA	You're one of them?
ADAM	I once believed as they do.
EISSA	And what is it they believe?
EISSA	What are they after?
ADAM	They took it as a given that...
ADAM	The cessation of life as we once knew it was inevitable.
ADAM	That soon enough mankind would tear itself to pieces.
ADAM	And that the world would cease to exist.
ADAM	Their goal...
ADAM	Our goal...
ADAM	Was to sift through the ashes and find survivors.
ADAM	Survivors who could help rebuild society. 
EISSA	But you left. 
ADAM	At first I was convinced... 
ADAM	What we were doing was noble. 
ADAM	We searched for people of strong faith and empathy. 
ADAM	Those... 
ADAM	Who would not lose their humanity once the laws and governments fell. 
ADAM	But the more the chaos swelled around us... 
ADAM	The more peoples' values began to change. As did the qualities we looked for and tested. 
ADAM	I knew I had to leave... 
ADAM	The moment I first heard them use the phrase... 
ADAM	"The Worthy." 
ADAM	Your father... 
ADAM	Was a kind man. 
ADAM	I warned him... 
ADAM	But he insisted on going back the way he came. 
ADAM	In order to save you and your sister. 
EISSA	My father believed the Seer had all the answers. 
EISSA	He was mistaken. 
EISSA	Aleph Ya'a.
EISSA	This is your story. 
EISSA	I will meet you in the Medina. 
EISSA	The end of the world might have been yours. 
EISSA	But the beginning... 
EISSA	We'll see who it belongs to.
