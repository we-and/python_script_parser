THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	Getting rid of litter properly. 

THOMAS	When Max and Monty were working on a Digging Site near my branch line, it was their job to take the waste to the dump.

THOMAS	But the dump was a long way away and Max and Monty wanted to save time. So instead of traveling all the way to the dump, they unloaded the waste over a wall. 

THOMAS	Later I found the waste across my tracks! It was too late to stop and I crashed into it!

THOMAS	A Police Officer saw Monty and Max littering, and told them it was dangerous not to dispose of litter properly. 

THOMAS	By tipping waste over the wall and not at the dump, Max and Monty had caused Confusion and Delay on the railway.

THOMAS	And that's why it's important not to litter.
