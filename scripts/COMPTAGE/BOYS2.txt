Randy	Callboys, Randy speaking.

Wesley	(on the phone) Randy, could you come up here for a minute?

Randy	Now?

Wesley	(on the phone) Yes.

Randy	OK.

Wesley, Jay and Devon	(eating noises)

Come Dine with Me on television	(indistinct)

Randy	Callboys, Randy speaking.

Randy	Hi, Wendy.

Jay	(making eating noises) A porn version of this would score big time.

Devon	What, Come Fuck with Me? (laughs)

Jay	No, Come Dine and Fuck with Me. You have to keep the dining part. That’s its strength.

Wesley	So dine first and then fuck?

Jay	Then dine again, then fuck again and then you give your score. Gold!

Randy	Maverick are asking if we can move tomorrow’s meeting from eleven to nine. 

Devon	Is that Fonda?

Randy	No, it’s Wendy.

Devon	(teasingly) Wendy, dear?

Randy	Yes, that was Devon, yes. (chuckles)

Devon	(laughs)

Jay	What's this about?

Devon	Well, dildos.

Jay	What?

Devon	 am is fine.

Jay	But we weren't going to do it, were we?

Wesley	We’re not, Jay. We're just going to hear them out.

Jay	I don't want it.

Devon	(raises his voice) Well, then don’t come.

Randy	What do I tell her, Wes?

Wesley	Tell her it’s OK, Randy.

Randy	Wendy?  am is fine. Yes, bye-bye.

Randy	Can I be there too, Wes?

Wesley	Sure. If you want to, Randy.

Randy	I do.

Jay	I don't get why you think this is a good idea, Wes.

Wesley	I don’t think it’s a good idea.

Devon	It is a good idea.

Wesley	There you go: he thinks it is, and if you have any ideas, we'll listen to them too.	

Devon	Guys, honestly, Wendy and Fonda are good people.

Jay	(laughs) ‘Fonda’. What kind of name is that anyway?

Devon	What?

Wesley	You definitely didn't promise these people anything, did you, Devon?

Devon	No, Wes, absolutely not. It’s just an exploratory meeting to get to know each other. And I'm sure that by tomorrow : am, you'll be on board. And so will you.

Randy	It's at  am, Devon.

Devon	After they've pitched it to us, I mean.

Jay	If someone needs half an hour to convince me of his or her product, he or she has a crap product. 

Devon	You wait and see.

Jay	No chance.

Devon	(annoyedly) Yes chance.

Randy	So here at  am?

Devon	Here at  am.

Devon	(sighs)

Jay	(sighs)

Wesley	(blows)

Jay	(sighs)

Jay	Right. Randy, come on. Call them.

Randy	Jay, I just called them.

Jay	Call them again.

Wesley	Jay, they just called them and got the voice mail.

Jay	(annoyedly) Unbelievable.

Devon	They sent a text, didn't they?

Jay	(annoyedly) Right. 'Sorry, traffic jam. Smiley face'.

Devon	(raises his voice) So? That says it all: a reason and a 'sorry'. 

Jay	Come on, call them, Randy.

Devon	What are you doing here anyway? You didn’t even want one.

Jay	Huh?

Devon	(louder) You didn't want a dildo, Jay.

Jay	(raises his voice) You’re right. I don't want anything from someone who is almost an hour late and then sends that sort of text.

Devon	There they are.

Jay	Here, here. Yes, now they are. (annoyedly) Fifty minutes. Unbelievable.

Randy	Callboys, Randy speaking.

Wendy	Wendy and Fonda from Maverick.

Randy	(on the intercom) It’s on the second floor.

Fonda	Hold on.

Fonda	Go.

Devon	How exciting.

Jay	Unfriendly. Unprofessional. Un-everything.

Devon	Stay calm.

Jay	I am calm. Look. See?

Fonda	Ehm, yeah, we’re late, sorry. But could I first use your toilet real fast? 

Randy	Yes, of course. Follow me.

Fonda	Sorry.

Devon	That’s alright.

Randy	Oh, eww, sorry. Jay just used the toilet. Sorry.

Wendy	Hello, I am Wendy, I’m Fonda’s assistant.

Wesley	Wesley Biets.

Wendy	Hi.

Randy	Randy Paret, nice to meet you.

Wendy	We spoke on the phone.

Randy	That’s right, yeah.

Devon	Hey, hi, Wen. Nice to see you. (kisses her)

Wendy	Hey. (giggles)

Devon	Alright?

Wendy	Hi, Devon.

Jay	Fifty minutes.

Devon	Cut it out, Jay.

Jay	Jay Vleugels. Fifty minutes late.

Wendy	Sorry.

Jay	We said  am.

Wendy	Yeah, there was an accident.

Jay	Oh, an accident, right. Any injuries, casualties?

Wendy	I don't know.

Devon	Jay...

Jay	Then why the smiley face?


Devon	Drop it, Jay. Do you want a drink, Wen?

Wendy	Coffee, please.

Devon	Coffee, Randy.

Randy	Yes, no problem.

Devon	There we go.

Wesley	Table?

Devon	Great.

Devon	This is the office of the Callboys. Here, take a seat.

Wendy	Thank you.

Devon	You’re welcome.

Devon	That’s Wes.

Wendy	I know. We just shook hands.

Devon	You did. (chuckles)

Wesley	Wendy, could you briefly explain the general idea?

Devon	Dildos, eh, Wes.

Wendy	I suggest we wait for Fonda.

Wesley	We'll wait for Fonda.

Randy	Here’s your coffee.

Wendy	Thank you.

Fonda	Triumph Bonneville , drum brakes, oil in frame. Triumph Bonneville , drum brakes ... oil in frame.

Wesley	And you know each other?

Devon	From the Erotics Fair. Set up this meeting together, right?

Wendy	Yes. And I booked Devon last week to go to the sauna together. I thought I should get that out of the way. (laughs)

Randy	Oh, you're that Wendy.

Wendy	Yes.

Jay	A client?

Wendy	At the time, yes. (chuckles)

Devon	They, that was fun, right?

Wendy	A lot of fun.

Wendy and Devon	(laugh)

Wendy	Worth repeating.

Devon	Tell me about it! (laughs) You bet. (laughs)

Jay	Devon…

Jay	(sighs)

Devon	So this is the table. It's where we have our meetings.

Wendy	OK.

Devon	And where we eat.

Devon	Here she is.

Fonda	(chuckles) How embarrassing. Sorry. Do I get a second chance?

Devon	Second chance granted. Come here.

Fonda	Hi, Devon. Hello.

Devon	(laughs and kisses her)

Devon	You look great, girl.

Fonda	Thanks, you too. But you probably know that already. (chuckles)

Devon	Yeah. (chuckles) Take a seat.

Devon	Here, meet Wendy. (laughs)

Fonda	(laughs) Hi, Wendy.

Fonda	Fonda Beckers.

Jay	Jay Vleugels.

Fonda	Hi, Jay.

Randy	Hello.

Fonda	Fonda Beckers.

Randy	I’m Randy Paret, nice to meet you.

Fonda	Hi, Randy. Fonda.

Wesley	Wesley Biets.

Fonda	Hi, Wesley. Fonda.

Fonda	Biets? Ehm... Is that spelled E-A-T-S?

Wesley	No, it’s I-E-T-S.

Fonda	Oh right.

Wesley	Like a Flemish beetroot.

Fonda	(laughs faintly)

Wesley	Just call me Wes. Just Wes.

Fonda	OK. Hi, Wes.

Devon	Here we are, ehm. Meeting.

Fonda	Quick question... Is that your bike in the driveway, Jay?

Jay	Yes.

Fonda	A Triumph.

Jay	As it says on the fuel tank.

Fonda	A Bonneville.

Jay	Yeah.

Fonda	?

Jay	Actually, no. .

Fonda	Right.

Fonda	With the original drum brakes?

Jay	Yeah.

Fonda	And oil in frame?

Jay	(chuckles) What? You know what oil in frame is?

Devon	What’s oil in frame?

Jay	The oil is stored in the frame, not in a crankcase.

Devon	And what is a crankcase?

Fonda	(snorts) Sorry, I don’t have a clue. I don't know anything about bikes. Ehm… 

Jay	What?

Fonda	I sent a photo to a friend of mine who knows all about it and well…

Fonda	To break the ice a little, guys. We were very late.

Devon	(laughs)

Fonda	Sorry.

Jay	(feigned chuckle)

Devon	(shouts) Owned! (laughs) Jay, owned!

Jay	No, Devon. Not owned.

Devon	Jay Vleugels, come on.

Jay	No, because I knew it.

Devon	You didn’t know anything.

Jay	I saw through it.

Devon	Jay Vleugels, cut that out. She had you by the balls. (laughs)

Jay	Well played.

Devon	Jay, owned!

Jay	(shouts) No, Devon, not owned!

Randy	(chuckles)

Fonda	Sorry, Jay.

Fonda	He did say it was one of the most beautiful Bonnevilles he had ever seen.	

Jay	I can believe that.

Fonda	He did.

Wesley	So, Fonda...

Randy	(clears his throat) Would you like a drink?

Fonda	Ehm, water is fine. Yes, thank you.

Wesley	Water is fine for me too, Randy.

Fonda	Has Wendy told you anything yet?

Devon	No, we had to wait for you. Ehm...

Fonda	OK, fine. So we’re here because we spoke to Devon two weeks ago at the Erotics Fair in Mol.

Devon	Correct. At the afterparty.

Fonda	We thought it would be interesting to meet.

Devon	Meeting, right?

Fonda	Right. So here we are.

Wesley	And what business is Maverick in?

Devon	Oh, dildos, vibrators...

Fonda	Yes, among others. Sex toys, basically. Actually, we make everything, from butt plugs to zatsu balls. But our specialty is personalized sex toys.

Devon	Dildos, eh.

Fonda	In your case, dildos, yes.

Wesley	What are zatsu balls?

Fonda	Zatsu balls are silicone balls that you insert and you can make vibrate through bluetooth. They’re from Japan.

Fonda	They can be used anally as well.

Wesley	No, thank you.

Devon	Zatsu, zatsu, zatsu. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard of that. From Japan?

Fonda	That’s right, that’s right.

Jay	She just said they're from Japan.

Devon	That's probably where I know it from. Zatsu...

Fonda	So guys, all three of you... All four of you, sorry, Randy, have a... Wendy? A penis.

Devon	(surprisedly) Phwoar.

Fonda	The thing is: there are over three billion penises in the world. And they're all unique.

Jay	I knew that. Beats fingerprints.

Fonda	That’s right.

Jay	They once did an experiment in Mexico.

Fonda	Oh really?

Jay	In a prison.

Fonda	I didn't know that.

Jay	Yeah, I read it somewhere.

Fonda	And you remembered.

Jay	I've got very good memory.

Fonda	(chuckles)

Jay	Especially when it comes to my tools. (chuckles)

Devon	About penises. Homo.

Jay	(annoyedly) No, Devon.

Fonda	I know what you mean, Jay.

Jay	You see?

Fonda	Ehm, could I use that in my pitch from now on?

Jay	Absolutely, feel free.

Jay	It was in Jimenez in the penitenciario.

Fonda	Oh.

Devon	He said penis again. (laughs)

Jay	No, Devon. Penitenciario is Spanish for prison.

Fonda	That’s right. Ehm, you pronounce it as 'Jimenez' though.

Jay	Oh, is it 'Jimenez'?

Fonda	'Jimenez'.

Jay	Fancy that. I wasn't sure.

Fonda and Jay	(chuckle)

Jay	Come stai?

Fonda	Estoy muy bien. Y tú?

Jay	(laughs) Que sí, que no.

Fonda	Tú también? Allora ...

Fonda	Allow us to demonstrate. Toma.

Jay	Obrigado.

Fonda	De nada.

Fonda	Here you go, Devon. Here you go.

Wendy	We prepared these in advance.

Fonda	Wes, there you go.

Devon	Hey, fuck, man.

Fonda	So those are three dildos you can customize to your own liking and you’ll be able to sell all over the world.

Wesley	(scoffs)

Fonda	What’s wrong?

Wesley	Is this a joke?

Fonda	No, we wouldn't be here otherwise.

Wesley	I’m afraid I’m gonna have to pass.

Wesley	Anyone else want something from the kitchen?

Devon	Come on, Wes. You should at least give the meeting a chance.

Wesley	I have, Devon. And now I'm going to have a quark sandwich.

Devon and Randy	Wes.

Devon	No, Wes, you’re being rude.

Fonda	Just leave it. Let him go.

Devon	But still...

Fonda	Don’t worry about it.

Fonda	Let me show you something. You can choose from the menu.

Devon	That's incredible.

Fonda	Good, isn’t it?

Devon	Yeah.

Fonda	Wendy, can you explain it further? Yes?

Wendy	Sure. This is the default model. By clicking in the menu, you can change all kinds of features.	

Fonda	Hey.

Wesley	Hey.

Fonda	Could I have some more water, please?

Wesley	Of course.

Fonda	Why did you walk away all of a sudden?

Wesley	(sighs) Not my thing.

Fonda	But you knew why we were coming, didn’t you?

Wesley	Yes, but I only agreed to the meeting to calm Devon down.

Wesley	You've probably noticed by now that this isn't an easy environment to manage. It involves a little give and take.

Fonda	Yeah, a lot of testosterone in a small space.

Wesley	(sighs) A lot.

Wesley	They're good guys, but... You know?

Fonda	A burden.

Wesley	Huh?

Fonda	A burden.

Wesley	Yeah, a bunch of crazy fools.

Wendy	Wow, nice one. (chuckles)

Jay	Ehm, yeah. But it's not really Jay yet.

Wendy	Forget about the size for now.

Jay	I know. But what's special about me, is my pubic hair.

Devon	That's true.

Wendy	OK, but you can add pubic hair.

Jay	You can?

Wendy	Yeah, look, here. There.

Jay	Is that pubic hair? Wow, unbelievable. An afro.

Wendy	Yes, for example.

Jay	(chuckles) Right, Randy?

Wendy	There you go, for example.

Devon	Happy Hippo?

Jay	Anything you want.

Wesley	Impressive though. This morning, Jay didn't want to know about your

dildos. Fonda	Jay? He's buying.

Wesley	How do you know?

Fonda	I knew that as soon as I saw his photos on your website. So will Devon, by the way.

Wesley	What did you think when you saw my photos? ‘I'll reel in Wesley Biets with a biology lesson about dicks and a dildo on a tablet?' (chuckles)

Fonda	No, I didn't.

Wesley	No?

Fonda	No.

Fonda	I wondered if you were eighteen yet.

Wesley	(scoffs)

Fonda	(laughs)

Wendy	There are two different motions.

Devon	Oh, and what's the difference?

Wendy	(chuckles) Huge in terms of pleasure and not that much in price.

Devon	Really? With the first one? 

Wendy	No, with this one, the snake movement.

Devon	Hey, Fonda, snake movement, yes or no?

Fonda	I prefer that one.

Wendy	Me too.

Devon	Really? That's decided then. I need that.

Jay	What’s that?

Devon	The snake movement.

Fonda	It’s a motion a real penis can't make. 

Jay	I want that too.

Devon	But that’s mine.

Jay	It’s not yours.

Devon	I picked it first.

Jay	Picked it first. Says who? I selected it earlier.

Wendy	Did you find your pubic hair yet?

Jay	No, it's not here.

Wendy	Do you have a picture of it?

Jay	Yes, dozens.

Wendy	Send me a few later.

Jay	Via email?

Wendy	Yeah, send them to me.

Fonda	Wendy, we have to go or our schedule will fall apart.

Wendy	Yeah.

Devon	But I’m not done yet.

Fonda	Don't worry, guys. Wendy will save your dildos and you can continue working on them on our website.

Fonda	We'll also leave the Captain Cloners with you. Thank you. Here you go.  

Devon	What’s this?

Fonda	There you go.

Fonda	That's to make the moulds of your erection.

Jay	(laughs) It looks like a box of tennis balls.

Devon	(laughs)

Fonda	The instructions are inside. It's really easy.

Wendy	But they're not included in the price.

Fonda	Right.

Jay	Devon, check this out. (reads) 'Use morning erection'.

Devon	Those are the best.

Jay	(laughs)

Randy	True.

Jay	Listen to him. Randy Paret. (continues talking indistinctly)

Fonda	I will leave one for you, Wes. Just in case you change you mind.

Wesley	I won’t.

Fonda	OK, guys, we're off.

Wendy	For orders of over  items you get two euros off per item.

Jay	Two euros?

Wendy	Yeah, yeah.

Wendy	And an additional % off if you order within two days.

Jay	Quick deciders.

Fonda	Right. You can find everything on our website. Call me if you have any questions.

Jay	But pick up this time, OK?

Fonda	Of course. Bye.

Devon	Bye-bye.

Fonda	Bye.

Devon	(shouts) Be careful on the road, ok?

Devon	(sighs)

Jay	What was that?

Devon	Hey.

Jay	Fantastic woman.

Devon	And I brought her in.

Jay	The other one too. Both of them. 

Devon	I told you so.

Jay	Wendy, Wendy. Wendy was her name.

Devon	Jay, she had you with the motorbike. (laughs)

Jay	Hey, I thought: what’s this? A woman lecturing me about drum brakes?	

Devon	I was stunned too.

Jay	And knowing about oil in frame?

Devon	She knew everything.

Jay	And then admitting that she doesn't know anything about motorbikes and that she cheated... (chuckles) Devon She just admitted it.

Jay	That's when I knew: Yes, she's honest. You can trust her. 

Devon	Jay, and she didn't have to admit it. That's what’s important.

Jay 	She didn’t have to admit it.

Devon	(laughs)

Devon	So Wes... what do you think?

Randy	We're here, Wes.

Wesley	(sighs annoyedly) Simonne.

Randy	What?

Wesley	(sighs) I don't feel up to it, man.

Devon	Wes?

Wesley	What?

Devon	Do you think this looks weird?

Wesley	Are you kidding?

Devon	Well, Jay says the beads around my glans look like warts.

Jay	Come on, they are warts.

Devon	So what?

Wesley	What’s that?

Devon	That? A hippo. Wagging his tail for the clit.

Randy	You chose the hippo after all?

Devon	Yeah.

Randy	What about you, Jay?

Jay	The Viking helmet.

Randy	I knew it.

Devon	You decide, Wes: with or without beads?

Wesley	Whatever’s cheaper.

Devon	Without then.

Wesley	You're picking me up tomorrow, Randy?

Randy	Yes. Here. Say hi to Simonne.

Wesley	I will.

Devon	But, We...?

Wesley	Hi, Fonda.

Simonne	What did you just say?

Wesley	Huh?

Simonne	You called me Fonda.

Wesley	No, I didn't. I said Simonne. (laughs nervously)

Simonne	No, you said Fonda, Wes. I'm not crazy.

Wesley	I'm very sure I didn't.

Simonne	I'm sure you did.

Wesley	Well... (laughs nervously)

Simonne	That's a good start.

Devon	Fuck man, what's this? Is that shit?

Devon	For god's sake. Randy, call Wendy and put her on speaker. Why is he doing that?

Jay	Who?

Devon	Here, this hippo. Why is it flinging its shit around?

Jay	To mislead the enemy.

Devon	What? You knew that?

Jay	I read it once.

Devon	(raises his voice) You knew and you didn't tell me?

Jay	Alright, man, hey.

Devon	For god’s sake. Dumb fucking beast.

Wendy	(on speaker) ...message after the tone.

Devon	Wendy, it's Devon. About the…

Jay	And Jay.

Devon	Yes, and Jay.

Jay	There’s no need to repeat, she heard me.

Devon	No, it's her voice mail.

Jay	I mean, she can hear me when I speak.

Devon	(annoyedly) Jay, no, it's the voice mail.

Jay	God, this is unbelievable.

Devon	Wendy, hold on, I’m having a discussion with Jay.

Jay	(annoyedly) She can hear that too. She knows.

Devon	Wendy, call me back later?

Devon	Wendy? We... Oh right, it's her voice mail. Wendy, kiss Fonda for me. Talk later. Randy, end the call.

Devon	(shouts) What are you nagging about, man? I'm the one who's in a situation here. Jay Alright. Dear lord...

Devon	I scrapped the hippo and replaced it with a dog. Can you see it?

Wendy	So no hippo?

Devon	(on the phone) No, they fling their shit around.

Wendy	(chuckles)

Wendy	OK.

Devon	(on the phone) A dog.

Wendy	Yes. OK.

Devon	And I still have those beads under my glans.

Wendy	Yes, active beads.

Devon	What?

Wendy	They move.

Devon	(on the phone) Well, I had another look (on screen) at them and to me they now look like warts.

Wendy	Oh? I don’t think they do.

Devon	Well, Jay thinks so too.

Jay	They are warts, Devon. Don't do it.

Jay	Has she seen my pictures yet?

Devon	Jay is asking if you've seen his pictures yet.

Wendy	No, I haven't had the time.

Devon	Hasn't had the time, she says.

Jay	Come on, I sent them two hours ago.

Devon	Sent two hours ago, he says.

Wendy	We've been busy. Oh, here they are.

Wendy	(laughs)

Devon	What? Do you see it?

Jay	Give her here.

Devon	Wait, I'm passing the phone to Jay. Hold on.

Jay	Devon, come. Give it here, man. 

Jay	Yes. Wendy, it’s Jay. Are you seeing it?

Wendy	Yes.
	
Jay	You think your people could make that?

Wendy	How long is it? 

Jay	 cm. The length of the shaft when flaccid.

Wendy	I'll ask.

Jay	(on the phone) Great. Great service. (on screen) Bye, Wendy dear. Here's Devon again.	

Devon	Wendy?

Wendy	Yes? So I remove the beads for you?

Devon	(on the phone) Yes, that’s it. Lose the beads and done.

Wendy	OK.

Devon	We're on the tanning bed now. Randy will take our picture later and in the morning (on the phone) we'll make our Cloners. For sure.

Wendy	All three of you?

Devon	No, I don't think Wes will.

Jay	(makes chicken noises) Buk, buk, buk. (on the phone) Buk, buk, buk.

Devon	Jay is making chicken noises.

Jay	He's scared.

Devon	He's scared, he says.

Jay	Not me. Wes is.

Devon	(on the phone) Oh, not him. He means Wes.

Jay	Chicken.

Devon	Chicken, he says. (on the phone) The animal.

Wendy and Fonda	(laugh subduedly)

Devon	Bye, Wendy.

Jay	Bye, Wendy dear.

Devon	That’s Jay.

Jay	She knows, man.

Wendy and Fonda	(laugh)

Wesley	(pants and talks to himself indistinctly)

Simonne	Wes.

Simonne	Wes?

Simonne	Stop for a second.

Simonne	Stop for a second.

Wesley	(pants)

Wesley	(soothingly) Hey. Hey.

Wesley	Is your knee hurting?

Simonne	Yes. That too.

Wesley	I can feel it. It feels warm.

Simonne	It's the other one.

Simonne	You're not going out of your way for me anymore, Wes. Not in the bedroom. And when we talk (scoffs), you don't listen.

Simonne	It's been like that for a while. But today... this is the last straw. I've had it now.

Wesley	Come on, Simonne. I'm dumbstruck.

Simonne	Yes. (sighs) You look like it.	

Simonne	Is something the matter?

Wesley	No.

Simonne	(annoyedly) I pay you good money to have you to myself for one day a month, so when I pay, I want to have you to myself. That’s the whole point, Wes.

Simonne	I want to sleep.

Simonne	(sighs)

Wesley	(sighs, grunts)

porn actors in English on tv	(indistinct, moaning)

Devon	How long do we have left to go, Randy?

Randy	One and a half minute.

Jay	(sighs) Good lord.

Jay	Not now, Randy.

Devon	Let it ring.

Randy	But it's Wes.

Jay	Don’t answer it.

Randy	Hi, Wes.

Jay	For god’s sake...

Devon	(annoyedly) Randy, hang up that phone!

Jay	(shouts) Come on, fuck off, man!

Randy	Hold on, Wes.

Jay	Shh, focus.

Randy	Are you up already, Wes?

Wesley	(on the phone) I'm calling you, Randy, aren't I?

Randy	And Simonne?

Wesley	She left. Can you come and pick me up?

Randy	(on the phone) I'm going to Maverick in five minutes. I'll pick you up after.

Wesley	Maverick? Why?

Randy	To drop off Jay and Devon's Cloners.

Wesley	So they've made them?

Randy	(on the phone) They're making them as we speak.

Jay	How long now, Randy?

Randy	Just a second, Jay.

Wesley	Will you pick me up first? I want to come to Maverick.

Randy	(on the phone) OK, OK.

Wesley	And bring some clean clothes if you can.

Randy	OK, I will.

Jay	Yes! Yes, yes.

Devon	Randy, get over here!

Randy	Hold on.

Wesley	Randy?

Jay and Devon	(shouting over each other)

Randy	I have to go.

Wesley	Jesus. (sighs)

Randy	Ehm...

Jay	(annoyedly) He hasn't even read it yet. Goddammit!

Randy	Ehm...

Devon	With all that yapping.

Randy	(reads) 'Do not remove the penis from the tube with a jerk or other forceful movement. But wait until the erection subsides and let it slide out carefully'.

Devon	OK.

Jay	Makes sense.

Devon	So we wait. (sighs)

Jay	Yeah.

Jay	Randy, could you turn off the porn, please?

Randy	Oh right.

Jay	Thanks.

Devon	Randy, could you tell us something to help me relax?

Jay	Yes.

Randy	Ehm, sure.

Devon	Just a little story.

Randy	Where I used to live, there was this guy they called Mr Gob. If he was out of money at the bar, you could give him five euros and he would let you spit into his hand and he would lick it off and…

Devon	(groans) Ah, there we go. Great. Thanks, Randy.

Randy	Thanks.

Devon	(groans)

Randy	It's a nice one.

Devon	That’s me.

Devon	I'm taking a shower.

Jay	Randy, I'm still here.

Randy	Oh, sorry, Jay. Ehm...

Randy	Yeah, so this guy was always ill.

Jay	Mr Gob?

Randy	Because of all the spit. Sometimes there would be really thick, yellow pieces...

Jay	(groans) Yeah... Good god.

Jay	Yes, looking good. There you go.

Randy	That's a nice one too.

Jay	Thanks, Randy.

Jay	Wow, Devon?

Devon	Yeah?

Jay	I had a great erection.

Devon	Me too.

Jay	Really?

Devon	Yeah.

Jay	Mine was impressive. (chuckles) Shower together?

Devon	Mine was hard as concrete.

Jay	Like concrete? You wouldn't stand a chance. Mine was like a concrete drill.

Wesley	Hi. Did you bring clean clothes?

Randy	Yes, they’re in the back.

Randy	How did it go?

Wesley	Not good.

Randy	Oh, do you want...?

Wesley	Don’t ask.

Wesley	And we are going to Maverick now?

Randy	Yes, I'm dropping off Jay and Devon’s Cloners. Devon was asking if you really didn't...

Wesley	No.

Randy	OK, I had to ask.

Devon	'Mario Bros' is such a weird name.

Jay	(mumbles almost indictinctly) He’s not called Mario Bros.

Devon	Oh, you're whitening your teeth. Leave it.

Jay	Hold on. (slurping noise)

Devon	You need to leave that in.

Jay	His name is not Mario Bros.

Devon	You need to leave it in for ten minutes.

Jay	Mario Bros is not his name.

Devon	Yes, it is. It says so on there.

Jay	No, the 'Bros' stands for 'brothers'. The Mario Brothers. They are brothers.

Devon	So he has brothers?

Jay	Yeah, one.

Devon	And who’s that?

Jay	Luigi. The green one.


Devon	That Luigi?

Jay	Yeah, the green one is Luigi, Mario's brother.

Devon	Luigi Bros?

Jay	No, Luigi Mario, Mario's brother.

Devon	Hold on. If Luigi Bros is called Luigi Mario, then what is Mario Bros called?

Jay	Mario Mario.

Devon	Come on, Jay, that makes no sense.

Jay	Devon, they are Italian plumbers, invented by the Japanese, who run through the sewers of Mushroom Kingdom on a dragon called Yoshi. Nothing about it makes sense.

Devon	Oh...

Jay	(sighs)

Devon	OK. Jeez, that's what I admire in you, Jay.

Jay	Huh? What?

Devon	You know so much. I don’t know anything.

Jay	You can't have it all, Devon. Anyway, you have a nicer body.

Devon	I do. (chuckles)

Devon	But , mind you, I do put a lot of work into it.

Jay	So do I. Ehm... Look. I bleach my teeth. I drink algae juice for the colonic, I have face masks, tanning beds... Hey.

Devon	Yes, but nothing that requires effort.

Jay	What did you say?

Devon	Nothing that requires effort, Jay.

Jay	(threateningly) What?

Devon	What?

Devon	Here.

Jay	Batman bar?

Devon	Batman bar.

Jay	Help me up. Hup.

Devon	Put both of them in.

Noor	Thank you. Bye.

Randy	Hello. Wesley Biets and Randy Paret from the Callboys for Wendy and Fonda from Maverick. 

Noor	From what?

Randy	Maverick?

Noor	No, where are you from?

Randy	Oh (chuckles), the Callboys.

Noor	Hmm, do you have an appointment?

Randy	No, we're here to drop something off.

Noor	OK, you can give that to me. I’ll take care of it.

Randy	No, it's a surprise.

Noor	A surprise?

Randy	Yes.

Noor	You can take a seat. Let me make a call.

Randy	Thank you. Sorry.

Wesley	Don't say sorry all the time, Randy.

Randy	Sorry.

Noor	Wendy, it’s Noor. I've got two cowboys for you. That's what they said: cowboys.

Devon	There you go, that's one.

Jay	(groans)

Devon	Come on. Another eight to go.

Jay	(groans)

Devon	Come on.

Jay	(groans) Aww, aww. Get me down. I felt a jolt in my leg.

Devon	What?

Jay	For real, come on, get me down.

Devon	Really?

Jay	Get me down. Get me down, Devon. Get me down.

Devon	Take it easy.

Jay	(groans) Dear god.

Jay	(pants) Yeah, I felt a jolt in my leg.

Devon	Are you OK?

Jay	Dammit. What a shame. (groans)

Devon	Oh no.

Jay	I started so well.

Devon	Shall I put some ice on it?

Jay	No, Devon, I need rest now. Rest is the best thing for it.

Devon	Just let me know.

Jay	It feels better already, Devon.

Randy	It’s a big place.

Wesley	Huh?

Randy	Big.

Wesley	It's not small, no.

Randy	Oh.

Randy	I could go and make it now.

Wesley	Randy.

Wendy	Here might not be the best place, Randy.

Randy	In the car. We have to wait anyway.

Wesley	(annoyedly) Randy, please.

Wendy	In the parking lot?

Randy	We have blacked out windows and water to mix it up.

Wendy	OK.

Wendy	Then let me wish you a pleasant erection, Randy Paret.

Randy	Thank you, Wendy.

Wesley	Is this a joke?

Randy	It only takes ten minutes. I’ve seen Jay and Devon do it.

Randy	Where are you going, Wes?

Wesley	I'm coming with you.

Randy	Oh, OK.

Wesley	That was a joke, Randy. I'm not going with you. I'm going to have a smoke. Jesus, man.

Randy	Sorry. Thanks, Wes. Thanks.

Kjetl	(grins) Oh, the Callboys don't?

Kjetl	You're missing out on a big share of the market.

Wesley	No one is stopping you, Kjetl. (chuckles)

Kjetl	Me?

Kjetl	From doing what?

Wesley	From exploring that gap in the market. (chuckles)

Kjetl	Joker.

Kjetl	If I were a whore, I wouldn't hesitate.

Kjetl	But I'm not a whore. I am Kjetl Benson from Fuckarmy.

Kjetl	And this morning, I closed a K deal with the ravishing Fonda Beckers. And you, what did you do?

Kjetl	Good name though, 'the Callboys'. (grins)

Kjetl	What was your name again?

Wesley	(insecurely) Wes.

Fonda	So what are you doing here?

Wesley	Ehm... I’m just, ehm...

Wesley	I wanted to see you again, actually.

Fonda	Wes, ehm...

Wesley	Yes.

Fonda	I'm not going to meet up with you.

Wesley	You aren't?

Fonda	No.

Wesley	Why not?

Wesley	I can quit tomorrow if I want to.

Fonda	(chuckles) You reckon?

Wesley	Yes, really.

Fonda	You don't have to sell yourself to make money out of sex. Do you know how that guy, Kjetl Benson, started his career?

Fonda	Dildos that look like gear sticks. Sold all over the world.

Randy	Done.

Fonda	Randy.

Randy	Hi, Fonda.

Fonda	Did you really make that in the parking lot?

Wesley	What?

Fonda	Here. It has an echo.

Wesley	No worries. I'm paying.

Fonda	Are you sure?

Wesley	Yes.

Fonda	OK. Noor? Noor?

Noor	Hm?

Fonda	Can you ask Wendy to come down?

Noor	Of course.

Randy	Jay and Devon won't appreciate that.

Wesley	No. You're right, Randy.

Wesley	Ehm... What are we going to do about that?

Noor	Thank you.

Wesley	I’ll order  extra of Devon's and  extra of Jay's.

Randy	I don't think that's a good idea.

Wesley	Randy, I know what I'm doing. Thank you.

Wendy	How did it go?
