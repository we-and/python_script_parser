??	papi, wie lange noch? 

??	nur noch‘n paar stündchen, mein mäuschen. dann sind wir da. 

??	mir ist langweilig... 

??	hoffentlich sind wir bald da. 

??	jetzt hör doch mal. 

??	wir befinden uns immer noch über dem atlantischen ozean. 

??	da kannst du dir doch leicht ausrechnen, 

??	wie lange wir noch brauchen, bis wir landen. 

??	kuck ma‘ 

??	schau doch ma‘n bisschen aus dem fenster und kuck nach, 

??	welche... tiere du in den wolken erkennen kannst... oder sowas. 

??	... and forgive us our trespasses... 

??	chill a while, sister. 

??	you shouldn‘t worry. 

??	we‘re in god‘s hands. 

??	oh father. i’m such a nervous flyer. 

??	have faith, sister. 

??	i suppose they told you the story when i... became a priest? or how i became a priest. 

??	well, i heard it was a miraculous conversion. 

??	that you were one of those awful l.a. gang members. 

??	you’d let satan into your soul. 

??	more than that, sister. 

??	satan had parked his car right outside the house of my soul. 

??	he’d busted the locks and was squatting his slimy self right in there. 

??	he was taking a dump in my toilet and kicking back on the couch, 

??	dialing himself a pizza. 

??	with the intention of staying for good. satan eats pizza? it’s a metaphor. there i was... 

??	locked up in my cell in pelican bay. in satan’s grasp. and jesus came to me. in a bright light. 

??	told me to be his warrior. now i fight for jesus.amen, father! amen! and you know that’s the winning team. we’re gonna whip satan’s ass. 

??	oh, father, really. mind your words.

??	i apologise for the cussing. but we will whip his ass on that judgement day. hey! 

??	can i get me a refill, here? 

??	bah-da-bing…bah-da-bing! 

??	is the freaking bar closed, or what! yes, sir? oh, jee... 

??	i was hoping for that lovely lady, 

??	who brought dinner, you know? more... erm... experienced. 

??	just the way i like it. sterwardess uniform... well, sir. we all have uniforms. 

??	yeah, but hers fit just right, just the way i like it, if you know what i mean. i guess not. what can i get you, sir? well... 

??	if you could get tinkerbell give me a refill or he flitters his way back up the top of that christmas tree. ok. one more. and then perhaps we should think about getting some sleep? 

??	blankets and some pillows and... 

??	i‘ve heard it all before, sir.how about if we… - mmm! 

??	what if i ... - i‘ve heard that before, too. 

??	now... 

??	you drink your drink, 

??	and be a nice, quiet little frequent flyer, 

??	or i’ll have to spank your bottom and throw you outside to play with the naughty boys. 

??	and it’s minus thirty outside today. okay? yeah, she likes me. 

??	there’s something on the radar. papa, ich hab einen hai gesehen. zwischen den wolken. das ist doll.

??	nein, einen echten hai! da! 

??	wie kann denn das sein, jorinde? 

??	wie kann denn ein hai fliegen? das ist doch‘n meeresbewohner. 

??	wait! several readings. closing! holy shit! 

??	look into the light, spawn of satan! 

??	we interrupt our program for an important message.

??	news just came in that flight nhl 

??	crashed on its way from vancouver to frankfurt near iceland.

??	we currently have no further information,

??	but air traffic control emphasizes that a terrorist act cannot be ruled out.

??	recording from case : 

??	present: cpt brent tyler and dr. rachel milner. 

??	we took the lead  hours ago. 

??	plane crash occured in prior investigation between greenland and iceland. flight nhl ... 

??	was on its way from vancouver to frankfurt. 

??	with a stopover in iceland. the doc... 

??	the documents reveal that  passengers and seven crew were on board. 

??	flight nhl  disappeared nineteen-zero-two from the radar. 

??	the immediately initiated search of the icelandic authorities was inconclusive. 

??	eight bodies have been found so far. 

??	once we know more, i‘ll report back. 

??	you think this and the plane attack are linked? now i know it. 

??	you sent her to the arctic? 

??	she’ll be pissed. she hates the cold. 

??	let’s hope your sister gets there in time. 

??	...only a few kilometers from here. 

??	our research team is already at the site. 

??	they are currently scanning the object. 

??	we’ve been busy tracking the retreat of the glacier 

??	since the effects of global warming have certainly accelerated the thawing process. 

??	right now, i wish it would get warmer. 

??	look at the size of that thing. 

??	this craft looks like some kind of warship. 

??	but i‘ve never seen a design like this. me neither. 

??	that’s why i called richter in. 

??	that‘s why we‘ve got an advance party in there. 

??	we don’t know what the hell is in there. this is our finest team. highly motivated. 

??	their dedication is faultless. 

??	i know they can handle this. you see more details from the helmet‘s cam. it‘s a live feed. 

??	that‘s maynard‘s camera. 

??	fuck! 

??	we need to get her out of there. get help. 

??	get! help! 

??	live feed from london

??	connected to: diabla richterdr. richter! richter! we need help. send help now. that... that seems... 

??	they captured one of the scientists. 

??	it‘s her camera’s signal we’re watching. no.

??	it’s too late. you can’t save her! 

??	just get the hell out of there! she might be alive. 

??	oh my god! 

??	cabin of dr. kammler did you see all that? yes. my past is finally catching up with me.

??	but... you have to get out of there now! i‘m trying.  

??	why does she never listen to me.  

??	what‘s happening there?  

??	this is worse than i feared…  

??	a nation built on the foundations of freedom.

??	no country in the world is stronger,

??	more powerful and greater than the united states of america. 

??	we bring prosperity and peace.

??	hey big sis. 

??	hi. 

??	never do this again, please. 

??	i really worried this time. dad! 

??	i‘ve never seen anything like this before. 

??	did you forget to tell us that you might know something? 

??	don’t tell me…

??	let us talk about something else. 

??	yes. 

??	let’s talk about your past, dad! 

??	that‘s all. thank you. 

??	project ‘himmelsfaust’ was the brainchild of 

??	the brilliant nazi scientist dr.hans kammler. 

??	pioneer of genetic mutation surgery. by , the nazis were desperate for effective ‘super weapons’. 

??	and kammler thought he had them in spades. geht das jetzt, martha? 

??	ja, herr general major. jetzt. 

??	hochverehrter 

??	herr ss-reichsführer heinrich himmler. 

??	als parteigenosse 

??	erlaube ich mir, 

??	ihnen ergebenst 

??	folgenden bericht 

??	zum sonderbauvorhaben s 

??	vorzutragen. 

??	ich wollte damit meinen soldaten 

??	noch näherrücken,

??	und ich will ihnen an dieser stelle,

??	soweit mir es möglich...

??	unsere ingenieure 

??	konnten bereits 

??	erste erfolgreiche 

??	antrigravitationstests 

??	antigravitationstests? oder -test? 

??	tests. 

??	wir müssen nochmal von vorn anfangen. 

??	weil wir haben das geheimprojekt ‚glocke‘ vergessen. herr dr. kammler. ihr besuch ist da. 

??	er soll kurz warten, bis wir den bauantrag fertig haben. 

??	jawohl. herr reichsmarschall. 

??	bitte haben sie noch etwas geduld. herr kammler hat gleich zeit für sie. 

??	das ist ja eine unverschämtheit. 

??	hermann? mein lieber kammler. sie müssen mir helfen. 

??	schönen guten abend, lieber hermann. 

??	weinbrand? doppelt! 

??	hör mir zu, lieber kammler. 

??	meine gesamte flugzeugstaffel wurde mir von diesen britischen möchtegern-fliegern 

??	in einem feigen und unehrenhaften hinterhalt komplett ausgeslöscht.

??	nun stehe ich da wie ein völliger depp, 

??	der nicht weiss, wo er hingehört. 

??	sag mir, dass du eine lösung für mein problem hast. auf den endsieg. 
	
??	mein team forscht seit geraumer zeit neben dem dynamik-luftfahrt-programm an einem... 

??	genmanipulierten serum namens kb. aber das weiss ich doch. das weiss ich doch längst alles. 

??	also was kann dieses kc? kb. 

??	hermann. hermann. die schale? 

??	papperlapapp.

??	ich denke, lieber hermann, 

??	dass dieses projekt, 

??	welches ich dir jetzt zu zeigen gedenke, 

??	das blatt zu wenden vermag. 

??	es wird dem reich ermöglichen, die kontrolle über den himmel zurückzuerobern. 

??	welch wagemutige behauptung, kammler. ich bin ganz ohr. beeindrucken sie mich. ich präsentiere: projekt himmelsfaust. 

??	dies ist der aufruf an das deutsche volk.

??	ein jeder einzelne hat seine aufgabe deutlich vor augen.

??	jeder volksgenosse ist sich der ernsthaftigkeit und der gesamtlage

??	unseres geliebten reiches bewusst.

??	millionen treuer kameraden sind den heldentod für unser vaterland gestorben,

??	um sich gegen die zwingen des feindes im kampf zu stellen.

??	der übermacht unserer feinde standen wir bis heute nur mit mut, ehre

??	und entschlossenheit gegenüber.

??	doch es gibt hoffnung.

??	dank deutscher ingenieursleistung und dem genie dr. hans kammler konnte die

??	vergeltungswaffe kb entwickelt werden.

??	unter der leitung von dr. klaus richter

??	steht nun der kampfstoff bereit, dem feind die stirn zu bieten.das serum wirkt bei männern regenerierend, gewebeaufbauend und

??	lässt unsere tapferen soldaten unzerstörbar werden.

??	die bis jetzt nicht zur gänze abgeschlossenen forschungen lassen vermuten,

??	dass kb das leben eines gesunden menschen verlängern könnte.

??	das -jährige reich könnte so unter seiner führung ewig bestehen.

??	der kampfstoff bei frauen angewendet,

??	führt bei der weiblichen zellstruktur zu einer zombiefizierung.

??	die äusserlichen veränderungen und das aggressive verhalten wirken befremdlich,

??	doch dr. kammler sieht durchaus erwünschte, positive effekte.frauen werden stärker, ausdauernder und entscheidungskräftiger.

??	somit kann die volksgenossin die reihen unserer front mit auffüllen.

??	kb, erschaffen in unseren laboren,

??	hat die testphase endlich abgeschlossen

??	und steht nun bereit, seinen siegeszug anzutreten.

??	über den schlachtfeldern im osten,

??	den staubigen wüsten afrikas und abtrünnigen nationen

??	wird schon bald die fahne des sieges wehen.

??	kb wird das blatt des schicksals endgültig zu unseren gunsten wenden.

??	durch den taktischen einsatz von flugzeugen

??	und als gas versprüht, werden aus unseren toten soldaten

??	millionen untoter supersoldaten.

??	wie der phoenix aus der asche, werden sie sich von ihren totenfeldern erheben,

??	um wiedergeboren ihrer deutschen heimat zu dienen.

??	durch kb werden die toten helden unserer nation die beschützer einer neuen ära.

??	getragen durch den ruf der vaterlandsliebe,

??	ist die vorherbestimmung der endgültige sieg.

??	unzerstörbar und unaufhaltsam wird sich eine division nach der anderen erheben,

??	um in reih‘ und glied in die waffenfabriken zu marschieren.

??	jeder von ihnen wird seine flugmaschine besteigen:

??	die reichsflughaie.

??	diese wunderwerke der konstruktionskunst

??	sind in vereinigung mit dem supersoldaten

??	die ultimativen vergeltungswaffen.

??	versorgt mit strahltriebwerken, maschinengewehren und dem

??	aeronautischen konzept des hais

??	steigen sie dem himmel empor,

??	vereint durch den eisernen willen zu siegen.

??	das ist das gebot der stunde.

??	nun soldat, steh auf, und sturm brich los!

??	sieg!

??	bereiten sie mir eine präsentation für den führer vor. 

??	ich garantiere ihnen, er wird zufrieden sein. vielen dank, kammler. 

??	ich stehe in ihrer schuld. vielleicht sollten wir uns einmal gemeinsam auf die jagd begeben. 

??	ich habe gerade in braunschweig 

??	ein entzückendes kleines jagdschlösschen errichten lassen. 

??	sowie es meine forschungen erlauben, komme ich gerne darauf zurück. hai hitler. hai hitler. 
 
??	the himmelsfaust was the central facility.

??	it belonged to the ss parachute battalion .thus it was... 

??	directly supervised by goering himself! 

??	that was exactly the crux of the matter. 

??	after the stalingrad fiasko and in the following months, 

??	goering realized that their -year reich 

??	would not even turn ten years old. 

??	but he saw the potential behind kammler’s idea. 

??	so we got everything we wanted! and we took our chances. 

??	the horten brothers built the engine. 

??	henkel took care of the steering column construction. 

??	and the doctor and i synthesized kb. how could you? 

??	you have played god. no. 

??	we did not play god. we were gods. 

??	how do you think i got this position? 

??	and who do you think you worked for the last  years? let me summarize: 

??	once these predators are in the air, 

??	nothing and no one is safe. 

??	and they can play invisible! that‘s a disaster. 

??	so that’s what’s in those water tanks at the himmelsfaust? 

??	genetically mutated flying nazi sharks? 

??	the sky sharks are much more than just genetically manipulated animals. 

??	they are perfect weapon systems. 

??	they‘re lurking in the clouds, 

??	watching and preying mercilessly. 

??	there‘s  hunting sharks model rfh . more couldn’t spawn. but believe me: 

??	of them are enough to destroy whole cities. 

??	ich habe damals nach den schweren angriffen auf die reichshauptstadt

??	vom . / . november in berlin erklärt, es würde die stunde kommen,

??	in der wir es dann heimzahlen werden.

??	die englische presse hat mich am anderen tag auf das massivste angegriffen,

??	die höhnische frage aufgeworfen, ob die neue waffe, die ich noch angekündigt hätte,

??	etwa im propagandaministerium statt im rüstungsministerium abgeworfen werde.

??	sichern! 

??	begreifst du die lage nicht! 

??	herrgott, die russen werden bald hier sein! wir müssen kämpfen! das werden wir nicht. 
??	wir werden dein kb nehmen, und dann 

??	werden wir uns auf den letzten freien platz in richtung agentinien begeben. das ist verrat! sieh dich um, klaus. 

??	das hier ist vergangenheit. die himmelsfaust ist verschwunden. 

??	das experiment ist fehlgeschlagen.wir werden nicht wegrennen! das werde ich nicht zulassen! 

??	klaus! wir werden nicht weglaufen! das werde ich nicht azeptieren! 

??	fürs deutsche vaterland! 

??	but you came to the west after the war 

??	an worked for the military here. how is that possible? i owe it to paperclip! paperclip? 

??	you were one of the paperclip boys? what is paperclip? 

??	project paperclip originated from operation overcast. 

??	we tried to acquire the best scientists of the german army’s research institute 

??	behind the back of our allies.

??	jet propulsion and rocket engineering... stealth technology... we found ourselves in the world’s biggest toy store. 

??	and under no circumstances did our forces want to share it with the russians. 

??	so we snatched conspicuous nazi scientists and made them our paperclipboys. 

??	overnight wernher von braun became america’s greatest rocket scientist 

??	without anyone ever asking any questions about his past. i told them all i knew. 

??	they found it hard to believe at first. the scope of the ‘himmelsfaust’ project. 

??	i told them i’d lead them to kammler.

??	then they’d have all the evidence they needed. 

??	i’ve had enough of kammler’s special brand of madness. 

??	he was going to drag us all down with him. 

??	i’d signed up to build a stronger germany. not destroy it. 

??	i really want to start all over. 

??	but you have to trust me! 

??	give us a reason why we should. 

??	because only i can save the world. 

??	but more than a  of us came to the us. 

??	and you just switched sides. just like that? all is fair in love and war. 

??	and then...

??	you just stopped, founded a family and... 

??	played mr. nice guy? 

??	how are we supposed to ever trust you again? 

??	after you lied to us all these years? 

??	hello, this is natalie rochefort 

??	from mtp news.

??	we‘ve gotten word from several terrorist attacks taking place throughout europe. 

??	it seems london is under attack. several... sky sharks! oh my god! 

??	they‘re tearing people apart! 

??	hier ist clara von de lubb direkt für sie vor dem reichstag. 

??	wa...?

??	was ist das? matze! hast du das? 

??	sie werden nicht glauben, was das... 

??	matze? hast du das? was... das ist doch... das sind... what have you done? 

??	how much time do we have? a week max. 

??	i’ll call a nsc war council meeting. time to strike back. 

??	security level .

??	authorisation granted.

??	angelique, i need you to get me the head of german intelligence. 

??	and see... if you can reach our french friend colbert. 

??	and we need the... the japanese shark expert, dr. katsube. 

??	but we can‘t do without that weird cia guy martin keele. 

??	he might be in venezuela for all i know, but... we need... oh... 

??	that fucking arrogant guy from london. whatever his name is. 

??	and my friend frost of course. 
	
??	sorry. i‘m a little late.

??	gentlemen.

??	ladies. 

??	hello, klaus.

??	how are things? 

??	not bad, mitch, not bad. how‘s marjorie? oh fine. 
	
??	you know she still makes the worst corn bread ever. 

??	my research indicated that the himmelfaust project was destroyed. program neutralized. but i was wrong. 

??	what, i‘m sad to say, i helped to create  years ago, has been dormant. 

??	waiting for the opportunity to strike. 

??	well, no use crying over spilt milk, dr. richter. 

??	that is, if you can call  airline passengers chopped up like beef jerky 

??	in a span of  hours ‘spilt milk’. the reality is, we have to destroy these abominations. 

??	or no aircraft in the air is safe.

??	gentlemen! dr. richter! 

??	these are sharks? 

??	but they can fly, you say? yes. 

??	they’ve been frozen in the ice of the arctic. 

??	look, this is a clear and present threat, senator. 

??	we have an elite commando in the french air force. 

??	we will make them available. i will arrange it. yeah? 

??	we happen to have one or two good pilots in the us air force too, my friend. pah! your top guns? 

??	our french elite can out fly them!

??	yeah? don‘t forget. 

??	if you ever want to get in a pissing contest, anytime, colbert! 

??	i can send a couple of my carriers down the river seine and blow some wind up your skirt, my french friend. 

??	but if the sky sharks can re-establish their breeding program 

??	who knows how many of these things could be unleashed. 

??	there’s more of these things in the pipeline? 

??	they have a breeding program? 

??	so how many of these things are there? a squadron? a flock? or what? 

??	it‘s inevitable.

??	this is how the project was conceived. 

??	world domination!

??	you sure did a great job when you cooked up this one, dr. richter. 

??	jesus, talk about a ticking time bomb. 

??	it’s like a god-damned nazi reunion tour. 

??	 ‘well, you missed us in ? guess what? we’re back!’ 

??	believe me, 

??	no one regrets this more than me. 

??	if they mutate, 

??	which they most likely will, 

??	they won‘t be as easy to hunt as regular sharks. 

??	dr. katsube has studied the data. 

??	she thinks there could be a solution. 

??	yes. from the initial data, it seems the sky sharks have developed 

??	a form of genetic stealth camouflage. 

??	what! 

??	it‘s that... if you can‘t see the target, 

??	doesn‘t matter how many missiles you have. 

??	their cloaking defences will make this difficult. exactly. more research. 

??	i feel we should appoint a subcommittee to report on this evidence. 

??	by inverting the natural sonar sensing glands in the sky shark’s skin, 

??	they‘re able to deflect standard radar pulses. 

??	the sky shark’s sonar impulses can be disrupted with a counter sonar signal. this will render the sky shark’s invisibility cloak defective. 

??	do we have equipment to do this? 

??	if we can get a military transport close enough with a device 

??	that emits a sonar pulse then we have a shot. 

??	the uk needs to take a leading role in this action. 

??	military action is not cheap. 

??	we have to consider the federal budget. 

??	the time for talk and bullshit is over! we will have to get the president and congress to approve this. we have to get all civilian traffic out of the sky. 

??	we need to create a no-fly-zone, 

??	put the skies under martial law 

??	it‘s the only way that we can be safe. 

??	make sure it‘s implemented. 

??	dr. richter!

??	senator, richter’s team are right. we have to strike fast. 

??	you got your orders ratified! 

??	get to work! 

??	hit these freaks with our sonar! 

??	and then our fighters can blow them apart! 

??	i wanna see them dropping to the ground like hooker’s panties at mardi gras! 

??	what he’s saying is fuck congress, fuck the president. let‘s just do it. 

??	man, i love living in a democracy. 

??	hello. this is harold everton from ny city news with a special report. 

??	i‘m in front of the new york financial headquarters right now. 

??	the world wide no fly zone is a disaster.

??	our economy is on the brink of financial collapse

??	and wall street has not opened today. 

??	is this another friday the th? 

??	can the government really keep us here in the country? it appears so. 

??	all flights are cancelled - why? 

??	and nobody can leave america. what‘s going on? 

??	why are they holding us here? how long will this continue? and are we under martial law? 

??	the president needs to give us answers. please god help us! 

??	and save our great country. 

??	i‘m harold everton in ny city signing out. 

??	back to the studio.

??	kai. 

??	please stop playing with this stupid ball, for god‘s sake. 

??	where do these flying sharks come from? who are these strange men riding them? 

??	but most of all, what is their goa...? hello, tyler. 

??	we have the sonar impulse ready. yes, we did it. you will now receive a suitcase with the antidote. 

??	and you know what to do with it. 

??	now the eiffel tower is gone, too! 

??	i just want to get out of here. damn shit. i’m quite with you. 

??	for  days i’ve been crouching here, witnessing how europe is transformed into something uglier than it’s been already. this no-fly-zone has to be lifted. then off, across the pond, and welcome back usa. what happens when they attack us? i‘m the best air marshal between paris and new york. no flying fish stands between me and my passengers. never thought i’d go hunting sharks in a plane. 

??	you okay? 

??	yeah. i’m fine. 

??	you sick or something? 

??	we can get one of tyler’s medics to give you a shot. no!

??	no. i’ll be fine. it’s just some stupid flu bug. 

??	if you say so. 

??	let’s go. 

??	i never thought i would see you again. 

??	after the mess you left for me. you must be angelique. hey. ey. 

??	what? look at this. what...? our flight is cleared. 

??	what? where? there.you‘re right. 

??	when energy becomes a weapon...

??	when the last remaining oil reserves rest in the hands of fanatics...

??	if our idea of freedom is threatened,

??	we must act!

??	war and terrorism must never be tolerated again.

??	setting out your challenge!

??	fighting at the dead flesh forces.

??	whoever occupies foreign countries nowadays no longer needs to be ashamed.

??	on today‘s battlefields no one has to die.

??	your avatar, your willingness to trade

??	and our knowledge ensures the safety of your family.

??	our sword of justice.</i

??	we stand between good and evil.

??	where injustice becomes law, resistance becomes a duty.

??	we are richter technology.

??	and our future is today.

??	this is the final call for ny .

??	boarding is already in progress at gate .

??	i repeat: all passenger for flight ny 

??	from nice to new york are requested to immediately proceed to gate. all right. strange. 

??	my office tells me that all americans are allowed to fly out. 

??	but i only see our small group. i couldn’t care less. 

??	the important thing is i am getting out. 

??	stealth mode‘green light! 

??	launch the attack on that nazi carrier! 

??	here‘s your captain speaking.

??	the vessel will arrive in a bit.

??	ea . expect some turbulences.

??	switch your body cameras on.oh jasmine. 

??	i don‘t know why you bother. 

??	you‘re pretty enough for that mess out there. it‘s a part of our job. you‘ll learn. 

??	excuse me, stewardess.

??	this stupid plane is going really slow. 

??	can‘t you tell that pilot of yours to speed it up a bit? 

??	i really gotta be somewhere. don‘t we all? 

??	you know what? 

??	why don‘t i ask the captain 

??	if we can throw out some of the more pesky passengers from economy class. 

??	i did see some fatties back there. 

??	oh, you might wanna spare the kids. what do you think? 

??	this will have consequences. okay. 

??	what kind of game is this? 

??	let me see. 

??	this is the coolest game in the world. 
	
??	does the female lead at least get clothes when you reach the next level? 

??	ladies and gentlemen.

??	this is your captain speaking with a short status update.

??	we have just passed faröer islands

??	and will be committed to the care of american air monitoring in about an hour.

??	in another  / hours we will be landing at jfk airport.

??	now enjoy your flight.what did you expect? 

??	they just visited europe. 

??	they should be happy we could leave it behind. 

??	you‘re damn right. you all right? some headache. 

??	guys! there‘s fucking something outside the plane! what! everybody calm down! i‘ll  be right back! fuck. 

??	we‘re approaching object in  sec.

??	multiple readings. 

??	approaching target.

??	prepare the pulse device! 

??	get ready for pulse device.

??	i‘m ready to shoot.

??	get ready, boys! - yeah! do it. 

??	fire pulse! thank you. we made it. 

??	they’re genetically mutating to defend themselves! shit! ok... 

??	your father had a premonition that something like this might happen. he gave me this. 

??	the kb connects all together. 

??	this is the antidote that keeps your sister from falling pray to evil. 

??	if she turns, you give her a fucking shot. 

??	hi dad.

??	we‘re in a pretty bad situation in here. 

??	what’s going to happen here tonight, never was my intention.you have to believe me! could it get any worse? 
	
??	we use innocent people as live bait. 

??	i swear, i’ll retire from everything once this is over! anyway... how is diabla? she claims it is a flu, but we both know better. 
??	listen... 

??	there’s one thing you need to understand. 

??	everything is connected with everything. 

??	they can feel diabla’s presence, and they want her. 

??	are you out of your mind? 

??	are we really just guinea pigs to you? 

??	nonono. don’t worry. they won’t harm her. 

??	they see her as one of their own. but... 

??	just look after her, will you? 

??	is that the reason why i am here alone? no, you’re not alone. 

??	but i’m too old for the battlefield. 

??	i can be of more help from here. 

??	a us navy patrol ship sent this shot  minutes ago. the pulse didn‘t work. 

??	the sky sharks are stronger. they keep mutating to defend themselves. 

??	i believe the himmelfaust and the sky sharks may be heading here. to new york. 

??	what do they want on the eastern seabord? 

??	i‘ve got a daughter going to columbia college. 

??	why are they coming near land? 

??	i believe they want to kill their maker. 

??	i‘m the only one who can create an antidote and reverse their programing. they must now i‘ve been working on a way to neutralize them. mein gott! 

??	they will destroy new york. this... is why... 

??	ladies and gentlemen, 

??	the only option left is to let the genie out of the bottle. 

??	project dead flesh. project dead flesh... 

??	may god have mercy. 

??	i thought that was just some story they told in the corporation. 

??	like something for the agents to tell their kids at night to scare them. so you‘re telling me there really is a project dead flesh? 

??	what is project dead flesh? 

??	well, it all started with the us losing in korea and vietnam.

??	i had come over in ‘ from germany with the help of project paperclip.

??	for a few years i was nothing but a sidekick to the us generals.

??	but in march ’, after the massacre of my lai, i came into the picture.

??	that’s when project dead flesh was born.

??	all of a sudden i got all the fundings and support i asked for

??	and nobody was asking any questions.

??	my team and i moved the lab over to fort hammerhead at da nang border.

??	project dead flesh was about creating the perfect soldier.

??	resilient, indestructible and unstoppable.

??	we called him damian.

??	my team implanted a neuro-receiver into the brains of fallen soldiers

??	so we could control them. 

??	microwaves in the lower beta-range allowed to send impulses from one brain to another.

??	i wanted full control over my super-soldier.

??	my technology had always worked in the lab,

??	but now we had a chance to test it in the field.we got permission to use an imprisoned charlie-unit as guinea pigs.

??	my special unit infected them with kb,

??	and my team and i documented their morphing into blood-thirsty vietcong zombies

??	who were supposed to attack camp hammerhead.

??	we knew the us unit would lose against charlie’s army of dead,

??	but we had an ace up our sleeve.

??	we flew in my super-soldier damian,

??	a green beret trained to operate behind the enemy lines.

??	what other called “hell” he called his “home”.

??	he was in action from ’ to until a bullet killed him in the field.

??	his body responded to kb in an unprecedented way.

??	the good soldiers from camp hammerhead had just come back from a regular mission

??	and did not know what was coming at them.

??	they expected to have a quiet nightand some good rest after a few drinks.

??	damian was in sleep mode.

??	we connected his brain to that of my assistant, dr. greene,

??	in order to control his thoughts and movement.

??	we woke damian up and got him ready for his mission.

??	everything exactly as planned. open the gates. 

??	the vietcong zombies attacked camp hammerhead.

??	all hell broke lose and dr. greene started to remote-control damian

??	through the wire connection.

??	everything unfolded precisely as planned.

??	it was a full success.

??	damian was unstoppable.</>

??	but there was one flaw:

??	dr. greene.

??	unfortunately the secreted adrenaline in greene’s blood circulation

??	disturbed the transmission.

??	first he got cramps, then he twitched.

??	damian tore the receiver from his head and fell into an unprecedented blood lust.

??	we lost control.

??	he was unable to distinguish 

??	between friend and foe.

??	the experiment failed.

??	i stood there, could only watch,

??	could only wait until the smoke had cleared. 

??	until the kb was broken down in damian.

??	considering it was a disaster, still something amazing came out of it.

??	i had finally found the error in the system:

??	you can’t break a dead person’s will!

??	somewhere between all the muscles, bones and blood

??	every organism has its own unique energy.

??	but now...

??	with the help of modern nano technology, i can overwrite the will of any given individual!

??	this is the solution!

??	what‘s the combat status? i am kb! 

??	megalodon ready.holy shit. go get them, boys! 

??	fuck them up! 

??	step one. good job everybody. 

??	yeah. that‘s what i like to see. 

??	it‘s raining 

??	barbecued 

??	fucking catfish! 

??	yeah! 

??	she shot me. 

??	don‘t act like a pussy. we‘re safe now, sir. 
	
??	danger averted. every zombie dead.we‘re safe now. 
	
??	the plane is under control again. 

??	i wish you a pleasant flight home.

??	security connection desired.

??	authorization granted.

??	chardonnay or sake? 

??	or some spicy tuna? 

??	what? 

??	we’re ordering a sea food pizza. we’re gonna be at your place in two hours. what ever you prefer, is fine with me. are you okay? i‘m fine. just get here, will you! 

??	ready to talk about your retirement plans? later. 

??	what the fuck is wrong with him? maybe he’s just getting old!
