FEMALE VOICE V.O	Centuries ago, feudal Japan was ravaged by decades of civil war...as rival Japanese clans battled each other for land and supremacy.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	It was during this time, a legendary Shogun named Oda...from the Nobunaga clan, ascended to power...with the singular vision to unite and rule all of Japan.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	He was given a sacred stone known as the Jibutsu...by the dark priestess Yukai...believe to have been created in the ancient fires of Fuji.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	The stone was able to unlock devastating forces from a realm in the underworld..

FEMALE VOICE V.O	Whoever possessed it would become a god amongst mortals.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	One by one, Oda's enemies bowed before him.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	But his thirst for more power was unrelenting.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	It consumed him.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	Guided by his priestess, Yukai...known as the Chikara.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	Some forces were never meant to be controlled by man.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	Their dominance simply too great to ever truly be harnessed.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	Oda believed the Chikara would bring him immortality...but it was actually a harbinger of death and destruction.

FEMALE VOICE V.O	The Jibutsu was lost, lying dormant for centuries...waiting to be wielded once again.

GUARD	Move, inmate!

KORA	Whatever you say, sweetheart.

KORA	Why don't you loosen these cuffs for me.

MONK	Kana... the time is now.

MONK	The stone has awoken.

MONK	That's what you were born for.

MONK	That's what you're trained for.

KANA	I'm not ready.
	
MONK	You will be.

MONK	No one can know your identity or your mission.

MONK	You understand?

KANA	But is it evil?

MONK	Power is power. Oda was obsessed by the power.

MONK	Made him crazy. 

MONK	It's up to us. We are stone guardians.

MONK	This is your mission.

MONK	This is your destiny.

MACK	Oh, man.

MACK	Seriously, I ain't coming on these busts with you no more, man.

MACK	I shouldn't even be up here. You drive me all the way to San Francisco, made me drive my own car.

MACK	I shouldn't even be here. I'm not a field agent, man.

COLE	Well, I can tell by the non-regulation haircut you're not a field agent.

COLE	You look like an insurance salesman.
	
MACK	Whatever. I totally look like an agent.

MACK	Got the cool sunglasses. Got the cool car.

MACK	So, what comes with that? Danger zone.

MACK	Tip of spear danger zone.

COLE	So, how many more in there?

MACK	Man, I'm sitting here trying to express my feelings to you.

MACK	I gotta try and catch my breath. All you can think about's the bust?

COLE	What else is there?

MACK	What else is there?

MACK	How about the fact that I'm the only guy in the office who likes you?

MACK	How about that the Director would only put me on this job...to oversee you, after you messed up the Pacoima thing?

COLE	Hey, the Pacoima op was a success! I just shot too many people!

COLE	The FBI doesn't like us shooting people anymore!

COLE	All these civil lawsuits and crap.

MACK	Look, this isn't the 1980's, okay? 

MACK	Like seriously, can you just for once admit that my ass is on the line?

COLE	Oh, your ass is on the line.

MACK	Thank you. You see, was that so hard?

MACK	Oh, you're being facetious. All right, you wanna be business only?

MACK	That's fine. Okay. There are five confirmed targets inside.

MACK	And not only that, one of them is your informant from the Yakuza Syndicate.

COLE	Copy that.

MACK	Good luck. Go get them.

COLE	Oh, no. You're going with me. Let's roll.

MACK	No, no, no, no. I'm recon. I did my job.

MACK	I went, I did reconnaissance, I came back, I gave you the numbers.

MACK	I'm in the car. I'm gonna sit here with my non-regulation haircut.

COLE	No, you're gonna take those sunglasses off and you're gonna get the hell out of the car...and you're gonna back me up! Let's roll!

MACK	I'm not even a field agent!

COLE	Just stay low and quiet.

MACK	Hey, don't you think we should call this in?

COLE	We don't have time.

MACK	Jesus!

MACK	That thing scared me! It's plastic!

COLE	What part of "shh!" do you not understand? God!

MACK	Oh, my God, they got a lot of guns.

MACK	I didn't see that part in my recon.

COLE	Listen to me.

COLE	They don't know how many people we have out here. 

COLE	We could have a hundred people out here, for all they know.

COLE	So I just need you to have my back and look dangerous.

COLE	Can you look dangerous?

COLE	Good.

MACK	Don't you think I look dangerous?

COLE	No. Let's move.

MACK	I got your back, bro. Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

SUBTITLE	Hurry! Let's load it up and get out of here.

SUBTITLE	What is it?

SUBTITLE	That doesn't concern you.

SUBTITLE	Get it on the truck.

COLE	Freeze! FBI!

COLE	Anybody else wanna go down?

COLE	I'll put you down right now! Drop them!

COLE	Drop them!

KANA	Put the guns down!

COLE	Down!

COLE	Yeah, he's dead.

COLE	He's dead. That's great.

COLE	You, come on! Come with me! I want some damn answers right now!

COLE	Move! Let's go!

KANA	Dammit, Cole, you don't know what you're dealing with right now.

COLE	Really? So now you're running guns in Chinatown?

COLE	Wanna tell me what you're doing involved in black market deals up here in San Fran...when you should be down in Los Angeles catching a tan, huh?

KANA	It ain't guns, I swear! The boss got everyone looking for this thing.

COLE	Yeah? Is that what's in the crates? What thing? What is it?

KANA	I don't know. Some rock or something.

COLE	What, a jewel?

KANA	Some stone, some ancient Japanese stone.

COLE	This is such BS.

COLE	Hey, Mack, are you--

COLE	Mack!

MACK	They were so fast.

COLE	What the hell!

COLE	Jesus!

COLE	Freeze! Right there!

COLE	Drop it! Drop them both!

KANA	Get that away from her!

COLE	Put the box down, lady!

COLE	Put it down! Put that down!

MACK	What's she doing?

COLE	What's going on here?

COLE	Watch out!

KORA	Time to go.

KORA	Do not be afraid. The stone knows where it's going.

KORA	It will not harm us.

NEWSCASTER #1	We interrupt this program for some breaking news.

NEWSCASTER #2	Rescue parties are working around the clock...

NEWSCASTER #2	as police and community members desperately search for survivors.

YOUNG WOMAN OVER TV	All these different colors, and I didn't know what was going on.

GLADNEY	I don't know what I saw. There was lightning, thunder, the ground opened up.

SHANNON	I heard this loud explosion. It was awful. 

SHANNON	And I went outside, and all I could see were clouds and smoke.

GLADNEY	And it looked like a war was going on.

LULA	My kids were in the room, and I ran out to see what's going on.

LULA	And I was like trying to wake them up.

GLADNEY OVER TV	And I've seen, you know, some pretty crazy stuff...but I've never seen anything like that.

ASSISTANT	You have a call, Mr. Baird.

BAIRD	Thank you.

KORA	Alex, my love, I'm en route.

BAIRD	I'll see you soon.

KORA	By nightfall..

BAIRD	Rosetti will meet you by a small town ff the main highway.

BAIRD	Just switch cars and he'll escort you the rest of the way.

KORA	We don't need mob protection.

BAIRD	Well, you need pawns.

BAIRD	And you may need a diversion.

BAIRD	Anyway, I'll see you in Los Angeles, and when I get there...we will show the world what real power is.

KORA	My lord, they will tremble at your power.

ASSISTANT	Your jet's fueled and waiting, sir.

BAIRD	Let's go.

MACK	Yeah.

SARAH	Hey, you okay?

MACK	Yeah, we're... we're okay.

SARAH	Where's Cole?

MACK	He's in the car, talking to his wife.

SARAH	The death toll's still rising. It's coming in in the hundreds.

MACK	Jesus.

SARAH	It's complete chaos here.

SARAH	Everything's still coming in. Sat images are trying to track the black SUV.
SARAH	I need you to get here as soon as you can, okay?

SARAH	Pena called an emergency meeting.

MACK	We'll be back in a few hours. I'm gonna hit the road.

SARAH	Hey, Mack.

MACK	Yeah.

SARAH	I'm glad you're okay.

MACK	Me, too. I'll see you soon.

PENA	I've been on the phone with New York...

PENA	Washington, and Chicago.

COLE	Sorry I'm late, sir.

PENA	Back to it. All we have is CCTV footage...of this man leaving Chinatown yesterday, 15:00 hours.

PENA	Unmarked SUV, black.

PENA	Carrying what appears to be a box or small antique of some kind.

SARAH	You okay, monkey?

PENA	We have never seen an attack like this before.

PENA	They found no chemical residues, no radioactive fallout...missile casings, or dirty bomb shrapnel.

PENA	Now, unless God himself didn't come down from the sky...to rain fire and brimstone on the unholy citizens of San Francisco...we have to find some bread crumbs.

PENA	Why are we looking at low level thugs and some women?

PENA	Because word on the street is...they are all somehow involved in a massive black market ring looking for that.

SARAH	Sir, do we know why the Asian commonality?

PENA	Why don't you ask that to our walking miracles over here.

COLE	Well, sir, it's like you said...Kana's no more than a low-level Yakuza mule...spouting old stories from the homeland.

MACK	Yeah, she's a Japanese errand girl.

MACK	I mean, I don't know many of them, but...aren't they all superstitious?

PENA	Well, so am I. Yes, I'm a superstitious man!

PENA	Especially when I have every organized crime family out there...looking for some mysterious weapon!

MACK	A rock. 

PENA	Shut up!

PENA	Rock, relic, crystal skull, whatever the hell you wanna call it.

PENA	The moment this man and this woman exit this warehouse...holding some box, and boom!

PENA	San Francisco was turned into a pile of charcoal.

PENA	So you're damn right, I'm taking everything into account...until somebody with some hard evidence...from the real world, can tell me otherwise.

PENA	So you get out there. You get out there and you get me something good.

PENA	You get me something fast. I don't care what the hell it is. 

PENA	I don't care if Santa Claus himself is using reindeers to drop bombs!

PENA	Dismissed.

SARAH	What the hell happened?

MACK	Hey, I wasn't the one who went all wild west out there.

MACK	I wasn't supposed to be there, all right? You gotta back me up on this, Panda.

COLE	Can you guys cool it with the high school pet names? We're in the FBI, for God's sake.

SARAH	You know he's right. He's not a field agent.

COLE	Not yet. But when he gets his hair cut, he will be.

SARAH	Come on, you guys, the Director's not kidding on this one.

SARAH	Everything's been thrown out. Al-Qaeda, Russia, North Korea...all the usual suspects are out.

SARAH	And your girl is the only thing linking those guys to anything close to a clue.

COLE	We need some more information on this. Where's Kana?

SARAH	Still in holding.

COLE	All right, let's go have a chat with her.

SARAH	Let's do it. After you.
KANA	What the hell? Am I under arrest, or what?

KANA	'Cause ain't nobody read me my rights yet.

KANA	I've been giving you dirt for two years now, Cole.

KANA	Do you know what he would do to me if he knew what I was doing?

COLE	See, Kana, you came to us. We didn't come to you.

COLE	You wanted protection.

COLE	Do you even know who you are?

KANA	The hell are you talking about?

COLE	This. You were born in Reseda... to good parents.

COLE	Hell, you went to private school in the Valley.

COLE	You played on the volleyball team. What volleyball player becomes a Yakuza killer?

COLE	It doesn't make any sense. None of your background does.

COLE	How do you figure into all of this? Who are you really?

KANA	You still think this is about the Yakuza?

COLE	What I think is that you are a good girl...that got in way too deep with some very bad people.

COLE	And now you're in way over your head.

COLE	But you can get out of this...by doing the right thing, right here, right now.

COLE	Just give me some real intel on whatever the hell this thing is.

COLE	Where was it made? Is it Russian? Is it Chinese?

COLE	Is it some new military tech?

KANA	It ain't nothing like that.


KANA	He don't care about the Chinese, the States, high tech...low tech, nuclear, chemical.

KANA	This is old. Like real old.

COLE	Okay, you keep feeding me that magic stone crap...I walk and you go to prison for a very long time.

KANA	I'm not freakin' lying! He's a believer.

COLE	Who's he? Who is he?

KANA	All the crime bosses work for him. 

KANA	It's all one global syndicate.

COLE	Okay. I'm leaving.

KANA	Go on then! I'm telling you the truth!

KANA	He's paying billions for it. He even got that witch girlfriend watching his back.

COLE	A witch? Great, so now we have a witch and a magic stone.

COLE	Where's the yellow brick road and all of the little people?

COLE	You want me to believe in witches now?

KANA	That was her in San Fran. The woman.

KANA	He's obsessed with the occult.

KANA	He knows there are forces that are beyond our understanding...and that can be controlled by the right will.

KANA	San Francisco ain't the only place that's gonna get hit.

KANA	He wants to show the world.

COLE	How do you know this? And who the hell is he?

COLE	Give me a name, Kana! Give me a goddamn name!

KANA	Alexander Baird.

COLE	What?

COLE	Alexander Baird? The tech giant?

COLE	So, you're telling me that the CEO of Knight Corp...the largest IT firm on planet Earth is behind all of this?

KANA	You go after him, you are stepping into a world you cannot come back from.

KANA	You are not ready, Cole. 

KANA	You are not ready to believe.

COLE	I don't need to believe, Kana.

COLE	I just need to stop this.

COLE	Thanks for nothing.

MACK	Cole, give me some chips.

COLE	No.

MACK	You let Kana go, huh?

COLE	More useful to us on the outside.

MACK	What's up with that stone?

COLE	What about it?

MACK	Well, do you think any of that mumbo jumbo she's talking about is true?

COLE	No. Look, forget about Kana.

COLE	The only thing we need to be working on right now...is finding that woman and whatever organization she's connected to.

MACK	Well, I don't know anything about that. Can I have one chip please?

COLE	It's not happening this time. In fact, I'm gonna give the rest of this bag to the chief.

COLE	Hey, Chief, how are you?

CHIEF	Cole, how are you?

COLE	A little snack for you, buddy.

CHIEF	Thank you.

MACK	Cole, you're an a-hole.

COLE	I know.

SARAH	That's it. That's them. Print it and I'll give it to Pena.

TECH	Right away.

SARAH	Director?

PENA	What is it, Agent Bask?

SARAH	We've got a hit on the SUV. We're tracking it heading south.

SARAH	I forwarded the coordinates to Cole and Mack.

PENA	All right. Let's make it happen.

SARAH	We'll get her. I promise. I'll do my part.

PENA	I know you will. Just do your job.

PENA	Make sure this does not happen to another city.

PENA	Get to work.

SARAH	On it.

COLE	Who's tracking this thing anyway?

MACK	Sarah's got some GPS and traffic cams she's been monitoring, I guess.

MACK	It's a black SUV traveling southbound, staying off major roads.

COLE	So we're on our own. Just like I like it.

MACK	Well, if we see something go down, we're gonna track it...we're gonna spot it, call it in. That's it, man, you know?

MACK	Keep our distance. Call it in. Easy peasy.

COLE	Easy peasy. Don't you ever say that again.

MACK	Why always knocking my vocabulary, man?

COLE	It's horrible.

MACK	It's just a saying, man. Peasy, you know?

COLE	You talk like a 13 year-old. It's embarrassing.

MACK	You know what? People like it. People in the office think it's cool.

COLE	People in the office? They laugh behind your back every time you walk off.

MACK	You're just mad, bro, 'cause they always invite me to coffee.

MACK	They're always running out getting me lattes.

COLE	No, no, no. What do you mean, they're running out to get you coffee?

COLE	You're the one who always comes in with the coffees.

MACK	Yeah, but they're always asking me for it.
	
COLE	Yeah, they ask you to go get it for them.

MACK	Yeah, but I don't pay all the time.

COLE	That's a good point. That's a good point.

ROSETTI	There she is. 

ROSETTI	What, no hug for an old friend?

KORA	Is that what you are now?

ROSETTI	You know me, I'm loyal to the guy paying the bills.

ROSETTI	Big man needed a job done. Called me.

ROSETTI	The pay's great, so here I am. He found it, didn't he?

KORA	Found what?	

ROSETTI	Found what? Found what!

ROSETTI	The thing! The thing we're all here for! The thing! That thing!

KORA	What if he just wanted you to escort his lady to the L.A. offices?

ROSETTI	Hey, listen, this is awesome, but...ain't no broad worth a half a million dollars road trip.

ROSETTI	No offense. Now listen, my guys got another car for you.

ROSETTI	We're gonna crush this SUV, get rid of it, 'cause you're being tailed.

ROSETTI	The cops, feds, are all over it.

COLE	There they are. Pull over.

MACK	No, man, we're gonna tag it and call it in.

COLE	Hell no. Pull over. Pull over!

MACK	Damnit, Cole! 

ROSETTI	Now, come on, for old time's sake.

ROSETTI	Tell me, what's in the box?

KORA	Wouldn't you like to know.
	
ROSETTI	Yeah, I would.

KORA	They're here.
	
ROSETTI	What are you talking about?

COLE	Stay frosty.

MACK	You're crazy!

COLE	FBI!

ROSETTI	Feds! Kill them!

COLE	Keep my back! Come on, move up! 

COLE	Drop your guns!

MACK	(indistinct)

MACK	Dude, she's doing it again!

MACK	We gotta get outta here.

COLE	(indistinct) Run!

COLE	Let's go!

MACK	It's cool, we're FBI!

COLE	Keys, keys, keys, keys!

MACK	Come on, we gotta go!
	
GIRL	Oh, my God, please, this is my mom's car!

COLE	Jesus! Can you turn this music off!

GIRL	What's happening?

COLE	Turn it off!

MACK	How?

GIRL	It's hooked up to my phone! I don't know where my phone is!

MACK	Oh, God! Look!

MACK	Go, go, go!

COLE	Turn the music off!

MACK	I don't know how! I don't know what I'm doing.

MACK	Cole, she ain't kidding!

GIRL	Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!

COLE	I need to concentrate!

GIRL	Do something!

MACK	You need to calm down! Calm yourself down!

COLE	Mack, you need to calm down.

MACK	You're right. I'm sorry. I'm not good at this yet.
COLE	All right. All right. I think we're safe.

MACK	You think my car's safe?

COLE	No. Maybe.

MACK	We gotta go back for it.

GIRL	Guys! Guys, I found my phone.

MACK	Oh, that's great.

GIRL	Wanna take a selfie?

MACK	Sure, I'll take a selfie.

GIRL	Say "cheese".

MACK	Cheese.

KORA	We can go now.

ROSETTI	Sorry, babe. This thing's coming with me.

KORA	You have no idea what you're doing.

ROSETTI	I kinda do. Tell you what, talk to the big man.

ROSETTI	We'll work out a better deal.

ANNETTE 	Next time, you need to come home first. I need to know that you're okay.

COLE	I know. I know.

COLE	I'm sorry, babe. I just...

COLE	We're gonna be on this case 24/7. This is...

COLE	It's a tough one.

COLE	We gotta find that thing before this happens again. It's just...

ANNETTE	And what was it?

ANNETTE	It's okay.

ANNETTE	It's okay. I'll tell the kids that you'll be home tonight.

ANNETTE	But you need to come home, okay?

COLE	I will.

COLE	Go for Cole.
MAX	Yeah, this is Max.

MAX	I got that info you asking for. Meet me downtown in 20.

COLE	All right. I'm on my way.

COLE	Hey. 

COLE	I love you.

ANNETTE	I love you, too.

ANNETTE	Go.

KORA	Hello.

ASSISTANT	Alexander's asking for an update.

KORA	Rosetti has the stone.

ASSISTANT	Are you hurt?

KORA	No. No, I'm fine. On my way back now.

KORA	The FBI found us.

KORA	Rosetti will reach out to you for more money.

KORA	But no matter. Retrieving the stone is our only concern.

ASSISTANT	I will let Alexander know immediately.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Hey, Luigi. What you got me, my friend?

ROSETTI	It's Rosetti, you little babushka.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	I play. You know, Italian--?

ROSETTI	Yeah, I know. You just not funny.

ROSETTI	Now, you know what I'm calling you for. You wanna do this, or what?

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Yes. Relax, my baby. Where do you want to meet?

ROSETTI	You got the money?

RUSSIAN WOMAN	You wouldn't be calling me if I didn't have the money.

ROSETTI	All right then.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Come to my place.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	We meet there.

ROSETTI	I hate that little Russian hooker.

ROSETTI	But she's super hot.

DRIVER	Yeah.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Ah, Luigi.

ROSETTI	There she is.

ROSETTI	Would you look at you. Look at you!

ROSETTI	She's like a Russian ballerina!

RUSSIAN WOMAN	I love him. I love him.

ROSETTI	Come over here!

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Funny, funny guy.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Funny guy.

ROSETTI	Beautiful, beautiful.

ROSETTI	All right, let's do business.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Relax. We have time, no? We have money.

ROSETTI	Yeah, I'm relaxed. Let's do it.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	Let me see the rock.

ROSETTI	Rock's in the box.

RUSSIAN WOMAN	We need to see it.

ROSETTI	Yeah, well, I must see the money.

BODYGUARD	(speaks Russian)

ROSETTI	Oh, oh! English! Speak-a the English!

RUSSIAN WOMAN	(speaks Russian)

BODYGUARD	(speaks Russian)

ROSETTI	What the hell is this? Come on!

ROSETTI	Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, or what? Really?

RUSSIAN WOMAN	I love you.

ROSETTI	You're gonna do this?

ROSETTI	Hey! Don't move. Put that box down.

BODYGUARD	Don't even try.

ROSETTI	You don't know what you have there!

ROSETTI	Do not open that box! Do not open that box!

ROSETTI	Get the box! Move it! Get it, come on!

ROSETTI	Get that thing! Come on!

ROSETTI	Well... that was pretty stupid.

ROSETTI	Get Alexander Baird on the phone.

BARTENDER	Soda water, no ice.

COLE	I tell you what, let's change it up this time.

COLE	I'll take a double whiskey instead.

BARTENDER	Are you sure you want a drink?

COLE	I know I'm not supposed to on duty, but...tonight is very unusual circumstances, if you get my drift.

BARTENDER	What do you wanna say? Should I take my family out of town?

COLE	Why don't you pour me a double shot of whiskey and take that as a yes.

COLE	You should.

COLE	Hey, Max.

COLE	I thought you said you were coming alone.

BARTENDER	The usual?

COLE	Your boys can take me out any time they want.

COLE	No one knows I'm here.

COLE	Tell you something. This stage of the game...we got nothing. We're down to this.

MAX	They need Max's help. 'Cause Max is the only one that knows what's going down, right?

COLE	We got no other leads at this point. 

COLE	And we just got our asses kicked again.

MAX	Yeah, I saw the news today. The Italians got the rock.

MAX	They're hungry for that bread. They double-crossed the man.

COLE	And by the man, you're talking about Alexander Baird?

MAX	Yeah, that's right. He runs it all.

COLE	What does that even mean?

MAX	It means, all the main badasses answer to him.

COLE	Oh, come on. Max, don't give me this global one world domination crap!

MAX	When a dude pays a million for one rock... everybody listens.

MAX	You know what I'm saying? 

MAX	It means he'll pay more if you got the balls to try.

MAX	Now, I guess Rosetti... well, he's got the balls.

MAX	Now, word on the street is he was there to take Baird's chick safe into L.A.

MAX	But hey, he saw a chance and he took it.

MAX	He's gonna try to make a fortune now.

COLE	So, why are you telling me this?

MAX	Because Los Angeles is our land.

MAX	And I'm not gonna let what happened in San Francisco and that town happen here.

MAX	So, if Max's gotta make cool with the pigs... that's what's gonna happen. No disrespect, right?

MAX	But we gotta look out for our own first.

COLE	So, then where is this meet going down?

COLE	You're gonna have to tell me.

COLE	All right, listen up. Max came through.

MACK	You serious?
COLE	The Italians have it.

COLE	They're trying to extort more money out of Baird. So this is our chance.

COLE	If Baird gets his hands on this thing, targets another major city...I mean, that's it. We're screwed. It's game over.

COLE	All the dominoes fall. This is how it's gonna go down.

COLE	We're gonna get ourselves a handful of trigger-happy agents...with really bad reps, and we're gonna intercept that exchange.

MACK	Let's do it.

SARAH	Where's the meet?

COLE	East Los Angles. The coordinates are already uploaded.

SARAH	Okay. I'll get the green light from Pena, and we prep.

SARAH	All right. But you two, you're gonna stay right here...and quarterback this op from where it's safe.

SARAH	Yeah, well, that's nice, but Cole forgets...that you lost your status two months ago in the whole Pacoima thing.

COLE	The Pacoima thing was a complete success, as far as I'm concerned.

SARAH	Yeah, well, as the only agent with arrest authority that the Director will approve...I am letting you know that we're going and we're doing our part.

MACK	Boom. How do you like them apples?

COLE	I don't. I don't like those apples one bit.

COLE	All right, but you stay inside Mobile Surveillance.

SARAH	Done.

COLE	And you!

COLE	You try not to get me shot.

COLE	22:00 hours.

MACK	How am I gonna get him shot? He acts like I'm a bullet magnet.

SARAH	You're not exactly a field agent, monkey.

MACK	I'm gonna be a field agent, you see.

SARAH	All right, prove me wrong.

MACK	You're always wrong.

SARAH	That is not true.

PENA	Mind if I join you?

COLE	Director Pena!
COLE	Of course not.

PENA	Mack told me where I could find you.

PENA	Didn't know you were a Catholic.

COLE	Recovering.

PENA	Yeah. I was an altar boy.

COLE	Oh, yeah? Me, too. Every Sunday.

PENA	I'm Mexican. Try every Saturday night in Spanish...and every Sunday morning regular mass.

PENA	Look, I don't... I don't see it as a weakness.

COLE	What's that?

PENA	You. This. Being here.

PENA	Tells me a lot about the kind of man you are.

PENA	That you could sit here and admit...sometimes we don't have the answers.

PENA	And that's a good thing.

PENA	Look, I'm agreeing to moving forward with this op.

PENA	I know Sarah has the title, but this belongs to you now.

PENA	Understood?

COLE	Yes, sir.

PENA	It's not a coincidence this thing just fell in your lap.

COLE	It's a curse.

PENA	You can bring us back that stone.

PENA	I believe that.

COLE	I'll leave you to it.

NEWSCASTER OVER TV	Four men with alleged tie to the Russian Mafia were found dead today... after a mysterious car explosion in East Hollywood.

NEWSCASTER OVER TV	Our very own Drew Johnson live on the scene with the latest details.

JAKLINA	Hello.

COLE	Sorry, I must have the wrong address.
JAKLINA	You must be Cole.

COLE	You know me?

JAKLINA	We're busy.

COLE	Is... is Mack here?

JAKLINA	Mack!

MACK	Send him in! I'll be out in a moment!

COLE	I didn't know that he had company. He didn't say anything.

COLE	Are you... a relative?

COLE	Just visiting from out of town?

JAKLINA	Oh, he doesn't tell you about me?

COLE	Hey, baby, can you help me with my vest?

JAKLINA	Baby! Why do you have to go?

COLE	Hey, what's up, buddy?

JAKLINA	Please don't leave me here.

COLE	Dude, I got a very good feeling.

JAKLINA	I want you to stay. I want to watch American movie.

MACK	I know you do, but listen. I have to go.

MACK	It's the end of the world. I'm an FBI agent now.

JAKLINA	You always leave me here alone! I don't like being alone!

COLE	I get it. How much does he pay you to prank me?

COLE	Are you the neighbor, or something?

JAKLINA	Excuse me?

JAKLINA	You listen to me. You keep him safe.

COLE	So, this isn't a joke?

JAKLINA	Baby, please. My FBI man.

MACK	You're being a jerk, bro.

MACK	I gotta go.
JAKLINA	Please stay with me here.

MACK	Listen, Jaklina--

JAKLINA	Don't you want to stay?

MACK	I really wanna stay. I mean, this is amazing.

JAKLINA	Baby.

MACK	It's like a free buffet.

MACK	But instead of food, it's joy and happiness.

COLE	All right, Mack.

JAKLINA	Please.

MACK	Cole, can I have like 15 minutes?

COLE	Yeah, Mack, we have to go.

COLE	Now, Mack!

MACK	Okay, okay, I'm coming.

JAKLINA	All right. Okay. You are good.

MACK	Okay, I gotta go.

JAKLINA	Be safe, okay? Make me proud, baby!

MACK	I will.

JAKLINA	Go get it!

MACK	I'll kill someone for you.

JAKLINA	Okay. No, don't do that.

MACK	Okay. Let's rock.

MACK	What?

COLE	Oh, you know what.

MACK	No.

COLE	Who the hell is that?

MACK	Jaklina?

COLE	Yeah, who the hell is Jaklina?
MACK	She's my friend Jaklina.

COLE	I have a thousand friends, and they don't look like that.

MACK	I could've sworn I told you about her.

COLE	No, no, no, you did not.

MACK	Yeah, I said, my friend's gonna be crashing with me for like a month.

COLE	You never said anything about your smoking-hot Ukrainian model friend.

MACK	First of all, she's Serbian.

COLE	What's the difference?

MACK	There's a huge difference between Serbia and the Ukraine.

MACK	Yeah, did you know that Serbia exports 30% of the world's raspberries?

COLE	Now you're just being dumb.

MACK	What?

COLE	Stop.

MACK	There's nothing dumb about--

COLE	To be continued!

MACK	Fine. All right.

MACK	Can we just go save L.A. for now?

COLE	You are such a dick.

MACK	Totally not a dick.

MACK	All right, Cole. You wanted the badasses of the agency.

MACK	Well, you got them. You remember Rocket Sanchez, of course, from Pacoima.

COLE	Pacoima was a success.

MACK	And this is Agent Romano. 

MACK	And my fellow badass Irish chick, Agent McKenzie.

McKENZIE	So, is this gonna be another standard bust and tag, or are we just chasing fairy tales?

COLE	A little bit of both.

ROMANO	Look, man, we just gotta know one thing.
ROMANO	Where they're at. Bang-bang. Cut to black. Save the world.

COLE	I like this guy.

COLE	All right, here's the play. Italians are about to make the hand-off... we're gonna intercept the exchange.

COLE	As soon as any of you get your eye on the prize...radio me, I retrieve it...we all get the hell out of there fast. Copy?

ROMANO	Roger that.

MACK	All right, guys. Nobody die, for real, all right?

MACK	I don't need that kind of paperwork.

SANCHEZ	Hey!

MACK	All right, man.
	
MACK	I'm cool.

MACK	I didn't know she was your cousin, bro.

MACK	I'm one of you guys now. I'm a field agent.

SARAH	Okay, let's go live. Can I get an AB check? Thermal and SAT images are up.

SARAH	Cole, copy?

COLE	Yeah, I read you.

SARAH	Agent McClay?

MACK	Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

COLE	Agent Bask, give us a heads up when the target's in sight.

SARAH	Copy that.

MACK	Hey, Cole.

COLE	Yeah.

MACK	Let's try not to get our asses kicked this time.

COLE	Seriously.

MACK	Like for real, man.

MACK	Like I've only been in one fight my whole life.

MACK	It was in sixth grade, against Tommy Dorson.

MACK	He had the same name as the boxer.

COLE	Tommy Dorson is a baseball player, not a boxer!

COLE	Pull it together!

ROSETTI	All right, all right, bring me the chest. They're gonna be here any minute.

ROSETTI	What, are you deaf? Bring me the friggin' chest!

ROSETTI	We hand over this thing to them, it's their problem!

ROSETTI	We get paid, family gets paid...and we get outta here as quick as we can, you understand?

SARAH	Here we go. Here we go.

SARAH	We have movement, boys. East end of the yard is Baird's men...west end is mob. All of them strapped, so watch yourselves.

ROSETTI	All right. How we doing this? Where's the money?

GUNMAN #1	Just relax, sir. Our employer would like to extend his gratitude...in caring for his property the way you have.

ROSETTI	What?

GUNMAN #2	Can we have your prints, sir?

ROSETTI	What are you talking about?

GUNMAN #2	We need a positive ID to transfer the funds.

GUNMAN #2	I hope this is not an inconvenience for you.

ROSETTI	Hold this. Careful.

ROSETTI	How long is this friggin' thing gonna take?

SARAH	Jamming their phones. Nothing goes in or out.

ROMANO	In position.

ROSETTI	This thing done scanning yet?

ROSETTI	All right, there it is. I'm not responsible for that anymore.

ROSETTI	Get it away from me, bring it to him, tell him it was just business, okay?

SARAH	Okay, network is down, Cole. You're green to go.

SARAH	Repeat, Baird's men have the chest.
COLE	Freeze! FBI! Put them down!

COLE	Drop your weapons! Drop the swords!

COLE	On the ground, Rosetti! Right now!

ROSETTI	You freakin' kidding me?

COLE	Get on the ground!

ROSETTI	Hey, FBI man...

ROSETTI	you know how much this suit costs? I ain't getting on the ground for nobody.

ROSETTI	You wanna arrest me, arrest me.

COLE	It's mud or blood, Rosetti. On the ground. Now!

MAN	What's happening?

KORA	Did you get it?
	
GUNMAN #1	Yes, ma'am.

KORA	Time to go.

SARAH	Power's down. 

SARAH	The system is off-line.

SARAH	Agent Bennett! Cole! Mack, do you copy?

SARAH	Mobile Unit is down. Zero visibility. 

MAN	Where you at? I can't see a thing!

MAN #2	Watch out, guys! Get ready!

SARAH	Mack? This is Mobile Unit. All systems are down. I'm on my way to you.

COLE	What the--

COLE	What the hell was that?

KANA	I know where they're going.

COLE	What are you doing here?

SARAH	Freeze! Don't move!

COLE	Hey!

COLE	Kana!

KANA	I'm not your enemy. 

COLE	Well, if you're not our enemy, then you've got a hell of a lot of explaining to do.

KORA	For nearly a thousand years...the Baird Knights have scoured the earth...for the one sacred stone.

KORA	The Jibutsu...forged by the fires of Fuji...taken by the first Shogun for one reason:

KORA	To rule Japan with unlimited power.

KORA	Tonight, your master will fulfill the prophecy etched on the sacred stone...and take his place as the new Shogun...the new leader of the West.

KORA	Just as Excalibur chose its master...so too will the stone.

KORA	A Ronin.

PENA	So this stone...has fallen into the hands of Alexander Baird.

PENA	Wow. We're getting our butts kicked at every turn here, guys.

MACK	Freakin' ninjas, man.

PENA	Shut up!

PENA	Cole?

PENA	Any thoughts that could illuminate this complete mess-up?

COLE	We should probably be asking her.

COLE	She's the one that's been pretending to be one of them.

PENA	All right, Kana, or whoever you are...care to enlighten us?

KANA	You're not ready.

PENA	Try me.

KANA	There's an ancient Japanese legend.

COLE	I'm leaving.

PENA	Cole, you sit down!

COLE	Are we really going to have to sit here and listen to this, sir?

PENA	You're damn right we are.

AGENT	Turn the TV on.

PENA	What?

AGENT	Turn it on! He's on every channel!

PENA	All right, get it on.

ALEXANDER OVER TV	You've seen a taste of what is to come.

ALEXANDER OVER TV	San Francisco, Winchester.

ALEXANDER OVER TV	The tiniest fraction of the stone's power.

ALEXANDER OVER TV	Your countries' leaders will never say what it truly was...but I am here, right ow...assuring you that this destruction came of my own hand...and to dispel all about amongst any of your leaders...I shall give you one more taste...so as to solidify their belief.

ALEXANDER OVER TV	This destruction is the counterbalance...to the decades of your world leaders' abuse of power.

ALEXANDER OVER TV	They don't know true power. I am here to show you all...to guide you to a new West, a new dynasty?

ALEXANDER OVER TV	Soon, every country across this earth...will recognize me as their one supreme leader.

ALEXANDER OVER TV	Any defiance or refusal to accept this...what you have seen today will pale in comparison...to the annihilation I will unleash upon you.

ALEXANDER OVER TV	And so it begins.

NEWSCASTER OVER TV	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not quite sure what we just witnessed here

NEWSCASTER OVER TV	I believe the actions of a madman, is the only thing I can think to say right now.

PENA	That's enough. Turn it off.

KANA	Told you you weren't ready, Cole.

KANA	Told you none of us would come back from this.

MACK	Okay, Kana, I think we're all ready to listen now.

PENA	It's time.

KANA	Centuries ago, an evil Shogun obliterated the Japanese countryside.

KANA	The Shogun's was Oda Nobunaga...and he discovered the stone that is now in Alexander Baird's possession.

KANA	The Jibutsu unlocks forces from a realm beyond this earth...and with it, Oda was invincible.

KANA	He conquered all of Japan, but it still wasn't enough.

KANA	His priestess guided him to use the stone...to invoke what is known as the Chikara.

KANA	Oda believed the Chikara would bring powers...that would enable him to rule the earth.

KANA	But the Chikara only brings one thing:

KANA	Total destruction.

PENA	So, what you're telling us is, we're dealing with evil.

KANA	No. The stone is power.

KANA	The spirit, life force...it needs someone strong enough or skilled enough...to bend it to their will and give it purpose.

SARAH	So, how do we stop it?

KANA	You can't.

KANA	Like I said, these are powers from beyond this world.

KANA	And his priestess, the woman--

COLE	You mean that witch we've been chasing.

KANA	She knows how to read the guides.

KANA	Knows the incantations to get it to where it needs to go.

KANA	It won't be long until she and Baird try to invoke the Chikara.

MACK	Okay, so how does it work?

COLE	Does it really matter how it works?

COLE	The point is that it does work, and if this psycho... decides to use it again, then we're all screwed.

COLE	I mean, that should be explanation enough for everybody.

PENA	Then we have to infiltrate Baird's building and get that stone back.

PENA	Do you know how to get into this place?

KANA	Yeah. 

PENA	All right, I'll brief Washington. This is far from over.

KANA	It won't be over until Alexander Baird is dead.

KANA	Or everyone else is.

NEWSCASTER OVER TV	First it was San Francisco, then a small desert town, both attacked.

NEWSCASTER OVER TV	Now, several isolated government buildings were attacked...in downtown Los Angeles. The world watching...locked in a state of panic, wondering when and where Mr. Baird will attack again.

MACK	Yeah, I just think he wanted to say good-bye to his family one more time, you know?

MACK	Just in case. I don't blame him.

JENNY	Daddy, are we safe right now?

JENNY	Did you catch all the bad guys?

COLE	Not yet, but we will.

COLE	We always catch the bad guys.

COLE	You don't have to worry about that. You just...

COLE	You just worry about memorizing these...painfully difficult words, and this...ridiculous phraseology.

COLE	Hey, babe, what are you drawing over there, huh?

SISSY	A catacorn.

COLE	A catacorn? 

SARAH	So sweet. 

MACK	Yeah. That's what it's all about, right? Family?

SARAH	You see yourself with one one day?

MACK	I just want to feel that, you know?

MACK	That... connection.

MACK	'Cause otherwise, what are we fighting for?

SARAH	I agree. 

ANNETTE	Jesse, how about you take Sissy outside and kick the ball around a bit, yeah?

JESSE	Come on, nugget. Let's go.

COLE	I love your catacorn.

SISSY	Thank you, Daddy.

COLE	What was the name of that place...I took you to back in high school?

COLE	I stole your dad's truck that night.

ANNETTE	Cole, what are you talking about?

COLE	You know, the place that was up on that overlook...and we went up there.

COLE	Just can't remember the name of it.

ANNETTE	Oak Glenn.

COLE	Oak Glenn!

ANNETTE	Why are you talking about Oak Glenn?

COLE	That's right, Oak Glenn.

COLE	God, we were so young.

ANNETTE	Cole.

ANNETTE	Cole, you need to talk to me.

COLE	I really don't know what to say about this one.

COLE	I mean, I don't know how this is gonna play out.

ANNETTE	No.

COLE	I've always been honest with you about this kind of stuff.

COLE	It's not good.

COLE	And I need you to get the kids.

COLE	I need you to leave town for at least a couple of days.

COLE	Go stay in Santa Fe with your parents. Anywhere but here.

ANNETTE	You saw what happened in San Francisco.

ANNETTE	You need to come with us.

ANNETTE	Is it gonna happen here?

COLE	I don't know if it's gonna happen here...but we may be the only people who can stop it from happening at this point...and we have to try.

MACK	Pena.

MACK	Cole. 

ANNETTE	No.

SARAH	Pena's calling it.

MACK	We gotta go.

ANNETTE	No.

COLE	You just gotta keep it together.

COLE	I'll be back.

COLE	Okay?

COLE	Please the kids and get out of town, okay?

KORA	You are ready, my lord.

KORA	One thing, love.
	
BAIRD	What have you seen?

KORA	I've cast several times on this day...and each time the runes say the same.

KORA	The same as my vision.	

BAIRD	Your vision?

KORA	You will have a challenger, my lord.

BAIRD	Special Forces pose no threat to us, my love.

BAIRD	We have the Jibutsu. Nothing has that kind of power.

KORA	It is not a soldier, my lord.

KORA	It is Ronin.
	
BAIRD	A Ronin?

KORA	My lord--
	
BAIRD	Tell me! You tell me what you saw!

KORA	My lord--
	
BAIRD	What did you see?

BAIRD	I want you to tell me!

KORA	You with sword...and a Nobunaga descendent in battle.

BAIRD	Nobunaga.

BAIRD	Am I defeated?

KORA	No, my lord, you are victorious.
PENA	Now, I'm being told that our CIA operatives...will be arriving at rendezvous point Delta shortly.

PENA	Now, this is going to be a small extraction op...led by a six-man Special Forces team.

PENA	Agent Bennett, McClay and Bask...are the ones who are gonna get us in and out of this facility.

PENA	Bennett, you're familiar with CIA protocol for something like this, are you not?

COLE	Of course, sir.

MACK	You are?

COLE	You never asked.

MACK	We're partners. You're supposed to share this kind--

COLE	What about Jaklina?

MACK	What about her? She's my friend.

SARAH	Who's Jaklina?

PENA	Agent McClay, is there something on your mind?

MACK	Yes, sir. I was discussing with my confidant here...why he chose not to share his military background with the rest of his team.

PENA	What, are you married? 

PENA	He's supposed to tell you about every piece of ass he's ever had before he nailed yours?

PENA	Are you done?

MACK	Yes, sir.

PENA	You trust that your partner has your back and will fulfill his duty to the best of his ability.

PENA	Can you manage that?

MACK	Yes, sir.

PENA	Good.

PENA	You bring us back that stone.

PENA	God bless and good luck.

COLE	You're a dick.

MACK	Come on, dude. Come on, I was just busting your chops in front of the boss.

SARAH	You two are unbelievable.

KORA	For our lord and master...Sir Alexander Baird.

KORA	Your Jibutsu, my lord.

KORA	Carved in the temple of Rengeo by Buddha himself...to vanquish thine enemy...in the face of enlightenment.

KORA	May the house of Baird reign.

COLE	What the hell is this?

KANA	I've trained my whole life for this moment.

KANA	You asked me yesterday if I knew who I was.

KANA	I am Nobunaga of the great Samurai lineage.

KANA	My forefathers knew this day would come...and prepared every generation of our bloodline for this eventual certainty.

KANA	I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you...but it was the only way to get this close...after I discovered the stone had awoken.

KANA	I will do what I was born to do...what I was trained to do.

COLE	Thank you.

COLE	Here's the deal. Kana's gonna enter through the south entrance.

COLE	My team will take the north entrance.

COLE	You get a shot at Baird, you take it.

COLE	And expect hostiles on every floor.

MACK	Freakin' ninjas, guys.

SARAH	They weren't ninjas.

MACK	For real, they're ninjas.

MACK	They know Kung Fu, they have swords, they wear masks.

COLE & SARAH	Shut up, Mack!

MACK	Sorry, guys.

COLE	All right, keep your heads down, eyes open.

COLE	Let's get that stone. Move out.

MACK	You're just full of surprises, aren't you?

KANA	This battle will not be won by bullets but by blades.

MACK	So the whole like errand girl, FBI informant, like, was that a lie?

SARAH	Let's go, Mackie. God, you are dense.

KORA	As it was in the beginning, so will it be again.

KORA	We honor the dead...both in the past and those to come.

KORA	Who here desires the great honor of dying at the hands of our lord?

COLE	All clear?

BAIRD	Tonight, we send a message to the world.

BAIRD	We summon the Chikara. Soon, all shall bow before me...before the newest global superpower.

COLE	All right, let's split up. You two with me.

COLE	You two with Mack and Sarah. Take the east stairs.

COLE	We'll meet on the 21st floor.

COLE	Go!

MACK	Okay! Good luck.

MACK	This could be a repeat of the Pacoima op!

SARAH	Shut up!

MACK	What the hell was that?

KORA	It answers to you, my love.

KORA	The Chikara is coming.

MACK	Let's move it! We're running out of time!

BAIRD	Go.

SARAH	Are you okay?

MACK	Yeah.

MACK	Holy crap, I got stabbed!

COLE	Seriously?

COLE	All right. (indistinct) for body counts is capped.

COLE	You guys take these dudes. I got a rock to find.

SARAH	Don't touch it.

MACK	You gotta pull it out.

SARAH	No.

MACK	Please pull it out.

SARAH	I can't pull that out!

MACK	All right, I'm gonna do it then.

SARAH	No, don't do that, don't do it, don't do it. It might've hit an artery.

MACK	I'm not gonna bleed out, I promise. Please pull it out.

SARAH	I can't, I'm sorry.

MACK	All right, I'm gonna do it.

MACK	No, you do it.

SARAH	I can't, I can't, I'm sorry.

MACK	Give me a kiss. It'll help.

SARAH	What?

MACK	Give me a kiss. It'll help.

MACK	I did it. Oh, my God. That hurt.

MACK	
SARAH	Thank you, that really helped. That's not so bad.

SARAH	You okay?

MACK	No.

SARAH	No?

MACK	No.

SARAH	Oh, come on.

KANA	That doesn't belong to you.

KORA	Nobunaga, my lord.

KORA	She is Samurai.

KORA	The Ronin.
	
BAIRD	It's not possible.

KORA	It's her... the one from my vision.

BAIRD	Are you challenging me, girl?

KANA	It cannot harm pure Ronin blood.

BAIRD	Is that right?

COLE	Drop the box.

COLE	Right now! Drop it!

BAIRD	FBI, you're late. 

BAIRD	The stone has found its rightful heir.

COLE	Not anymore.

KANA	Get behind me!

KANA	It will not harm us.

MACK	Cole! Stay behind me, Sarah.

KANA	You ready?

COLE	That was some crazy shit.

MACK	I'm staying back, man. I got stabbed.

COLE	Yes, please do!

MACK	I just ran up a bunch of stairs.

SARAH	We'll flank him from the other side.

MACK	I'm tired.

COLE	Keep going! I'll take the south entrance.

KANA	Okay.

PAINTED ON WALL	Elevators

KANA	Stop this!

BAIRD	You can't stop this.
BAIRD	So, a Nobunaga descendant has returned to reclaim her birthright!

BAIRD	The stone has found its master.

KANA	Yes, it has. 

KANA	This is over.

KORA	This hasn't been over for centuries, my dear.

KORA	I knew your ancestor.

KORA	I served Oda Nobunaga.

KANA	That's not possible.

KANA	Oda Nobunaga was a great man.

KANA	It was Yukai who turned on him, corrupted him.

KORA	I am Yukai.

KANA	You're an immortal.

KORA	The stone was lost for ages...and I scoured the planet for it.

KORA	And in this lifetime or the next...it will find its master.

COLE	Hands up now, Kora! Hands up!

KANA	No!

COLE	Kana. 

KANA	Get it. Get the stone.

COLE	All right, come on. I'll get you help.

KANA	No. This was meant to be.

KANA	I did my duty. Keep it safe.

COLE	I don't know what to do with this thing!

KANA	You're a guardian now.

COLE	I'm no guardian, and we're getting you out of here...before this whole place comes down. Get up.

COLE	Come on!

COLE	Come on!

COLE	Wrong way, Mack! The whole building's coming down!

SARAH	Go! Go!

MACK	God, it is!

COLE	Come on!

SARAH	It's over.

MACK	Yeah.

MACK	We did a lot of stairs while we were in there tonight.

SARAH	Really?

MACK	Yeah, seriously.

MACK	What? I got one of those apps. Here you go. Let's see what it says.

MACK	12 thousand!

SARAH	Oh, my God.

MACK	That's a lot of stairs.

SARAH	You're one of a kind. 

MACK	Field agent.

SARAH	Getting there.

MACK	No. Here. Arrived.

MACK	I am here. I am a field agent now.

MACK	I just helped save the world.

SARAH	You're monkey.

MACK	You're panda.

SARAH	Okay, those are the titles.

MACK	What?

MACK	Seriously, I want a promotion.

MONK	Now, you have seen the stone's power.

MONK	That's why we train every generation.

MONK	But it has a cost.
KANA	I understand now, but with all the destruction...all the lives lost...

MONK	We are only guardians.

MONK	We cannot possess the stone.

MONK	If we do it, we'll break the sacred vow.

MONK	The Chikara cannot be contained...once in the hands of evil men.

KANA	The one I gave it to was a good man, an honest man.

KANA	I couldn't have done it without him.

MONK	The Chikara will sleep for now.

MONK	But the stone will rise again.

KANA	And I will be ready.

KANA	Master.

KANA	If Yukai was an immortal, then Oda...

KANA	How do you know he was--
MONK	Oda Nobunaga dies centuries ago.

MONK	Go home. Get some sleep.

MONK	Tomorrow is a new day.

MONK	A new battle.

COLE	Well, it was a hell of a mission, sir.

GENERAL	Yes, it was.

GENERAL	Your country thanks you.

COLE	That stone is unbelievably dangerous. Please keep it safe.

GENERAL	We will.

COLE	Give your wife my best.

GENERAL	All right.

COLE	All right. You, too. Take care.

MACK	Agent McClay? What's up, Cole? So, what are they gonna do with the stone?

COLE	I have no idea.
MACK	What did they say? They didn't say anything?

COLE	It's safe.

MACK	You believe that?

COLE	Well, it's safe for now, Mack.

MACK	Yeah, what about the witch chick?

COLE	Come on, she's doing life in Federal Penn.

COLE	Where do you think she is?

MACK	That's good right there.

COLE	What's going on with you?

MACK	Oh, nothing, man. Just hanging out, you know.

MACK	Saturdays, you know. Mow the lawn. Maybe take a nap.

COLE	No, no, no. You're talking lower than normal. Something's up.

MACK	No, I'm not, I swear! 

COLE	Is it that Jaklina Serbian model chick, is she over there?

MACK	No, Jaklina was just a friend, dude. I told you that, man.

MACK	Besides, she's gone anyways. She went back to her war-torn country.

MACK	I guess she figured it was safer there than it was here.

MACK	Go figure. I got a new girlfriend now, actually.

COLE	You have a girlfriend now?

MACK	Yeah. I think you're gonna like her.

MACK	She's pretty cool.

COLE	Wait a-Wait, wait a second.

COLE	If it's Panda Monkey, I am hanging up right now.

SARAH	But he's so adorable!

SARAH	Bye, Cole.

MACK	Bye.

COLE	Unbelievable! Unbelievable!

SARAH	Come here, monkey-pooh.

MACK	He's just jealous. He is.

COLE	Got groceries!

COLE	Hello?

COLE	Babe?

SISSY	Daddy!

JENNY	You're home!

COLE	Oh, my three beautiful girls!

SISSY	I can't breathe!

COLE	Oh, we're smothering her!

COLE	Are you okay? Are you all right, sweetie?

ANNETTE	Babe, are you good with pasta for dinner?

COLE	Pasta's good.

ANNETTE	Jenny has soccer at seven.

COLE	I'll take her.
