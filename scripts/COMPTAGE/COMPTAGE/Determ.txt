(BASED ON SERIES 1900 'DEN AND DART')


thomas	hello everyone! today i learnt a very important lesson about... 

thomas	being determined!

thomas 	when mavis had to go to the dieselworks for repairs, the fat controller asked den to do her work at the quarry. 

thomas	but when den tried to organise the troublesome trucks... they were, well, very troublesome!

thomas	toby and henrietta told den he needed to be firm with the trucks. that was how mavis did it.

thomas	even though it was a hard job, den didn't give up. he took a deep breath and he showed those trucks that he was in charge.  

thomas	den soon had everything under control. even the troublesome trucks!

thomas	...and when mavis came back, she thanked den for doing such a great job. 

thomas	that's why being determined and not giving up helps you get things done.

		(END.)
