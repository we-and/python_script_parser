ISSIE	Bye Gunther.  Don’t say a word, ok?

ISSIE	heads out.

ISSIE	Anisha, Midison, I’m coming home. I’m not staying in this hell hole any longer. There’s nothing to do here. I hate it.  And ever since Dad died we’ve done his birthday in Cornwall. I’m not gonna forget it just because mum’s forced us to live out here.

ISSIE	No buses? Stupid town! Her PHONE RINGS. It’s Mum. She cancels the call, puts down her bike and heads to the Kauri Point Store.

MIRIAMA	What can I get you, hon?

ISSIE	Where can I get a bus to Auckland? Like asap.

KENNY	That’s an accent from out of town if ever I’ve heard one. Irish is it?

ISSIE	English.

KENNY	Ah. The land of the shortbread.

MIRIAMA	Ah, that’s Scotland, Ken.

ISSIE	So, the bus?

MIRIAMA	Oh, well on a Sunday, you’d be lucky. There’s one from Greenfield.

ISSIE	Okay.

MIRIAMA	Oh, no, but you need to catch a bus to Greenfield though and it’s a Sunday.

KENNY	Yeah, it’s a problem you see.

MIRIAMA	Yeah.

ISSIE	Argh, why is the transport so rubbish in this town?

MIRIAMA	Oh, he’s the mayor, you should ask him.

KENNY	Well it’s a good question. I just don’t have a short answer.

ISSIE	Right. Thanks. You’ve been really helpful.

ISSIE	leaves in a huff.

CORRINE	Was that Mitch’s granddaughter?

MIRIAMA	Yeah. I think so.

MIRIAMA	makes a phone call.

ISSIE	Argh, useless bike. Come to New Zealand Issie, you’ll love it.  It’ll be so much fun.

ISSIE	Hello?

AMANDA	Issie. You ok? Where are you?

ISSIE	I just. I went for a walk.

AMANDA	Well. Come home darling.

ISSIE	It’s not home though. Is it?

AMANDA	Please, just give it a chance. Your Gran’s cooking, lunch. You might want to pick up a sandwich. See you soon?

ISSIE	Fine.

NATASHA	Hey. Were you just at the stables?

ISSIE	No.

SAM	You’re Mitch’s granddaughter, right?

ISSIE	Wow.  News really flies around here.

SAM	Yeah.

NATASHA	I’m Natasha. This is my Dad.

SAM	Sam. You got a puncture? Do you want a lift?

ISSIE	Um. Yeah. Sure, thanks.

SAM	Throw it in the back.

CAR	ISSIE sits in the back, NATASHA and SAM in the front.

NATASHA	So, you’re from London? It must be a bit weird coming out here, the middle of nowhere.

ISSIE	That’s an understatement.

ISSIE	Are there horses in the forest?

NATASHA	No. There are horses at the stables. Come by if you like. You can meet my horse, Aramis. Dad’s in charge of that big water bottling plant down the road.

SAM	Alright, mate.

ISSIE	Oh, right.

NATASHA	But he sold it to Hexronn. It was an amazing deal. He made like…

SAM	Natasha.

NATASHA	…heaps.

SAM	Alright girls. Why don’t we take the shortcut to Mitch’s?

NATASHA	Yeah.

SAM	Alright. Hold on.

SAND	of Sam’s jeep careering over the dunes.

MITCH	Gunther. Come on. I’ll change the music. Gunther. Come back inside.

ISSIE	What’s up with Gunther?

MITCH	I wish I knew. We were half-way through his acupuncture session, and he just, walked off. We must have struck a blockage. Gunther, you get back here.

AMANDA	Yeah. Mum. That pig, oh good, you’re back. Oh, hello.

SAM	Hi. Ah, Sam. You must be Amanda.

AMANDA	Yeah.

ISSIE	No secrets in this town apparently.

SAM	How, how are you settling in?

AMANDA	Um, we’ve been here over a month and we’re still unpacking.

SAM	Natasha and I moved house ten years ago and I’m still looking for the spoons. They laugh.

ISSIE	Thanks for the lift.

SAM	No worries.

ANISHA	Hi Is. I cannot believe you’re leaving us. Well, here’s a little video we put together to remind you how much we love you.

FRIEND	You’re gonna have Christmas in Summer? That is so twisted.

ANISHA	I can’ t believe you’re leaving me, I’m actually distraught. 

FRIENDS	Apparently people there are proper unstable, so, you should fit right in / Oh my days, what am I actually gonna do, who am I gonna bunk off PE with? And I’ve got all this…

AMANDA	So this is still how it’s going to be? Every time we have a row you run away.

ISSIE	Came back, didn’t I?

AMANDA	I promise we’ll do something, we’ll do something good next weekend, we’ll do something Dad would have liked.

ISSIE	No we can’t. We can’t do the wild swim on his birthday. We always do the wild swim. It was his favourite thing.

AMANDA	Yeah. That man did not feel the cold.

ISSIE	And now we can’t even go to his grave.

AMANDA	Issie, I know it means a lot it’s just, England’s such a long way away.

ISSIE	Yeah. Whose fault’s that?

FOREST	BLAZE, alone and distressed, weaves wildly through thick, menacing trees. MYSTIC appears.

MITCH	Oh. I wouldn’t if I were you.

ISSIE	Why?

MITCH	It’s chilli and eggshells. Gunther’s favourite, tastes like, feet.

ISSIE	Ew.

ISSIE	Can you give me a lift?

AMANDA	Yeah, sure. What, you want to hit the shops? We could have a look around town?

ISSIE	That would take all of five minutes. I want to go to the stables.

AMANDA	Stables? As in horses?

ISSIE	Yes. Problem?

AMANDA	No.

ISSIE	Good.

AMANDA	I didn’t see that coming.

MITCH	Didn’t see that coming either, did you?

AMANDA	Oh.

AMANDA’S	AMANDA pulls up in her car, ISSIE in the front. TOM is working the stables.

AMANDA	Do you want me to come in with you?

ISSIE	No.
AMANDA	He looks like he’s in charge. Why don’t I go and have a word with him?

ISSIE	It’s fine. Just go.

AMANDA	Ok, ok! I’m going. Give me a call if you want me to pick you, up.

ISSIE	Hi um.

TOM	You looking for the kids? They’re in there.

ISSIE	Oh, thanks.

NATASHA	Hey Issie. We’re in here.

NATASHA	This is Issie. She’s from London.

STELLA	Hi, I’m Stella.

ISSIE	Hey.

CALEB	Hey.

CAROLINE	We’ve been to London. I met this really cool band in Camden.

CALEB	You met a busker outside the tube and gave him like $ for his terrible CD.

CAROLINE	Yeah, I think he recorded it in his bathroom or something because someone flushes the toilet at one point.

ISSIE	Are you two…

CAROLINE	Twins.

NATASHA	This is Caleb and Caroline.

DAN	London to Kauri Point? Who does that?

ISSIE	My mum apparently.

DAN	I’m Dan by the way.

NATASHA	Anyway, you’re probably dying to see the horses.

CAROLINE	This is Lord William III. Or Treacle. He’s part Welsh.

STELLA	So how long have you been riding?

ISSIE	Oh, actually I haven’t ever.

ISSIE	Oh.

DAN	Hey, don’t worry. Everyone’s been sneezed on by Treacle. He actually sneezed in my ear last week. Like right inside it.

CALEB	Just, stop, that is revolting.

DAN	It’s fantastic, it’s like an achievement, it’s like an award.

STELLA	One of the perks of being deaf.

CALEB	That is so gross.

DAN	I think it’s still in there, look.

ISSIE	Stop.

NATASHA	Honestly Dan, you’re such an idiot.

TOM	Hey, have you kids done the hay nets yet? How many times do I have to tell you?

DAN	Sorry, Tom.

CALEB	Sorry Tom.

NATASHA	Sorry.

TOM	Just get on with it eh?

ISSIE	That horse, that’s the horse.

NATASHA	Oh, wow.

ISSIE	Whose is it?

DAN	It’s not from here.

CALEB	It could have come over from Laurieston farm.

TOM	I don’t think so.

ISSIE	He’s the one I saw yesterday. It was in a real state.

TOM	Where did you see it?

ISSIE	On the road that goes through the forest. I think it was running away from someone. This maniac with a trailer. He nearly ran me over.

DAN	Could be a horse rustler.

ISSIE	Seriously? Horse rustler?

TOM	Horses are strong currency round here and when people get desperate. I’ll make some calls.

NATASHA	Y’know I saw a horse float the other day that seemed a bit suss. It was heading up the track to the old chicken farm.

STELLA	What did it look like?

NATASHA	I don’t know, like dark and grey, but with a stripe on the side.

ISSIE	A blue one?

NATASHA	Yeah.

ISSIE	That’s the same one. I’m pretty sure.

CAROLINE	And it was going to the old chicken farm? That is so creepy.

ISSIE	Why?

CAROLINE	Because it’s haunted.

CALEB	That’s an urban myth, Caroline.

CAROLINE	No, it’s not.

ISSIE	Where is this chicken farm?

DAN	Why?

ISSIE	‘cause maybe he’ll go back there.

NATASHA	Why would he do that?

ISSIE	I dunno. But he might.

DAN	Well if he did come back we can get a photo of him. Show it to the cops.

ISSIE	Exactly, we should try and stop him.

STELLA	We should all go.

CALEB	Ok. We, we, we, why do we all keep saying we?

CAROLINE	Don’t be such an old man, Caleb.

DAN	Yeah, if things kick off I know a couple of moves in Tae Kwon Do.

ISSIE	Two whole moves eh?

DAN	Yeah, so you can stand behind me. Although one of them’s just bowing.

NATASHA	Imagine if he came back while we were there though. If he can kidnap horses, then you can…

ISSIE	Why is it so hard to get anywhere in this country?

NATASHA	It really isn’t.

STELLA	How did you get around in London then?

ISSIE	On the tube like a normal person.

DAN	You don’t seem that normal to me.

ISSIE	Thanks. I’ll take that as a compliment.

DAN	Thought you would.

NATASHA	I’m cold.

NATASHA	You’re so warm. Like a racehorse.

STELLA	Yeah, or a rabbit.

DAN	Thanks, Stel.

ISSIE	So what’s the deal with this place we’re going to?

CAROLINE	It was an old battery chicken farm and there was a fire in the s. And everything was burnt to the ground, except for one warehouse. And like only a few chickens survived and they say that at night you can still hear their strangled squawks.

CALEB	“Strangled squawks”, gimme a break.

CAROLINE	Yeah, you won’t be laughing, when like a, zombie chicken comes tearing out of the forest and tries to eat your brains.

NATASHA	Is anyone else starting to feel a bit creeped out?

CAROLINE	No. I mean, they’re just chickens.

CAROLINE	Anyway, I’ve just remembered, I have to go.

CALEB	Why?

CAROLINE	I have to help Dad, he asked me to paint his boat.

DAN	Now?

CAROLINE	Yeah. Well, I should get started.

CALEB	Why are you painting dad’s boat?

CAROLINE	Because he’s giving me  dollars.

CALEB	 dollars?

CAROLINE	Ok, see ya later. Bye.

CALEB	Hang on, that is not fair.  dollars! Caroline! Caroline!

ISSIE	Are they always like that?

DAN / STELLA	Yep.

NATASHA	Well, that’s it.

ISSIE	Doesn’t look too bad.

ISSIE	No sign of anyone.

STELLA	Oh come on.

DAN	What?

STELLA	Gotta go.

NATASHA	Why?

STELLA	My brother has a game tonight.

DAN	Hold up Stel. I’ll come with you. There’s nothing here and I’ve still got heaps to do for Tom.

STELLA	Come on then, I’ll walk you back.

DAN	Thanks Stel. You two be ok?

ISSIE	Of course, we’ll text you if we find anything.

DAN	Sweet.

ISSIE	Ok. We might as well have a look. Unless you’re too freaked out?

NATASHA	Hardly. Come on then.

ISSIE	Ok. This is super creepy.

NATASHA	We should have just gone with Dan.

ISSIE	Are you and he like? A thing?

NATASHA	No.

ISSIE	Oh.

NATASHA	I mean, it’s complicated.

ISSIE	Sure.

NATASHA	He doesn’t really have time for girlfriends, you know. He’s totally focused on his work at the stables.

ISSIE	Oh right.

NATASHA	So, you know, I wouldn’t bother.

ISSIE	He’s like, not my type anyway.

NATASHA	We’re not cool enough for you out here, eh?

ISSIE	Wow. I so wasn’t saying that. What is your problem?

NATASHA	I don’t have a problem. I just know what you’re doing.

ISSIE	What? What am I doing exactly?

NATASHA	Coming in and totally taking over.

ISSIE	No I’m not.

NATASHA	You’ve only been here all of like, like five minutes. You’re making us all follow you about, and now we’re trespassing.

ISSIE	No, I said I was coming out here. I didn’t ask any of you to follow me.

ISSIE	Wait. Where are you going?

NATASHA	Home.

ISSIE	Wait, what if he turns up?

NATASHA	You seem to have all the answers, I’m sure you’ll figure something out.

ISSIE	Natasha.

NATASHA	Natasha!

ISSIE	Ok, well this is peachy.

ADAM	Hey, shut up.  Shut up.

ISSIE	Good, dangerous doggie.

ISSIE	Shhh.

ADAM	Oi. Give me those.

ISSIE	Go away.

ISSIE	Stop.  Stop.  Help.

ISSIE	Stop.

TOM	Hey, are you okay?

ISSIE	There was a man. He was chasing me.

TOM	Just get in the car eh and we’ll have a look.

TOM	No sign of him.

ISSIE	How did you know where I was?

TOM	Natasha phoned me.

ISSIE	Oh.

TOM	Hey, hey, hey.  Wow, wow, come on.  Come on, hey, come on.

TOM	Stay here, stay here, come on.

ISSIE	Is she ok?

ISSIE	I think he drugged her.

TOM	I’ll call the vet. Can you stay with her? Be careful.

ISSIE	You’re ok. You’re gonna be ok.

TOM	We’re gonna meet the vet back at the stables.

ISSIE	Where’d it go?

TOM	What?

ISSIE	The horse.

TOM	It’s right in front of you. You ok?

ISSIE	Yeah, I just saw. Nothing.

ANISHA	What? So, you’re trying to tell me this random horse just appeared out of thin air?

ISSIE	Yeah. It was, weird. It was like it knew that the other horse was injured and, I don’t know. Wanted to protect it, or something?

ANISHA	What, like a mystic horse?

ISSIE	No. Well, yeah.

ANISHA	Ok, so you’re seeing ghost horses now.

ISSIE	No.

ANISHA	Wait. Have you drunk enough water? Cause this one girl, Leila, she got really dehydrated, she went to Westfield and she thought this movie poster was an actual polar bear.

ISSIE	Oh. I gotta go. See ya Nish.

ANISHA	Alright. Stay safe. Drink water.

AMANDA	Hey I know, I know this move, it’s a big change for both of us. But we’ll get the hang of it. I promise.

ISSIE	I don’t think so, Mum. I don’t like it here. There’s strange stuff happening. Can’t we just go home?

AMANDA	Oh darling…

MITCH	Just checking Gunther’s not in here. He’s done something unspeakable in my gumboot. I’ve told Lesley that’s the last time I’m pig-sitting. Nigh night.

ISSIE	I miss dad.

AMANDA	I know. So do I.

AMANDA	What are you doing out here darling?

ISSIE	Mum, look.

AMANDA	Yeah, it’s beautiful.

ISSIE	So you can see it too?

AMANDA	Yeah. I’ve always wanted to live by the ocean. And now we’ve got it at the bottom of the garden. Come in, it’s cold.

ISSIE	Yeah, I’ll be in, in a minute.

ISSIE	So no-one else can see you?
