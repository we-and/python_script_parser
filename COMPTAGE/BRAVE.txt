REI	Hey kid, you mind changing that?

REI	Having to live through that was bad enough. I don’t need to see it again.

BOY	Better?

REI	Much. Thanks.

BOY	Come on. How can you miss such a clearopen chance?

BOY	Idiot.

REI	What’s the score?

BOY	One to zero.

BOY	Partizani is ahead.

ILIR	How much time is left?

BOY	Plenty. They just started.

ILIR	Good. I hate Skenderbeu.

BOY	Yeah, but Skenderbeu has a better teamthis season.

ILIR	You know they spend all this damn moneyfor these foreigners and they still fucking lose

LORIK	You don’t have to be so critical. He was abad ass. And that one guy with the beard,I don’t know who he is but --

ENCI	I don’t know. Those American movies always make Albanians look like a bunch of criminals.

ENCI	It’s total bullshit.

KOLO	Not true.

ENCI	It is true.

LORIK	No, not all of them do.

ENCI	Yeah? Then give me one movie. Just one movie where we don’t play these cliché scumbags.

ENCI	We have a beautiful country and I’m tiredof us being exploited. We’re not all crooks.

ELENA	You do remember we’re criminals, right?

ENCI	Shit. I mean, we’ve got to make a living too, right?

LORIK	Take it easy.

ELENA	Evening, BOYs.

ILIR	Evening, princess.

ENCI	So, shall we get down to business, brother?

ILIR	Yes, but first things first. The bag?

ILIR	As an act of good faith.

ILIR	Just to ease the tension guys.

ENCI	Look, we brought the deposit like youasked.

ENCI	Tell us when and where for the shipment, okay?

ILIR	 Take it easy, brother. We’re just finishing up.

ELENA	What are you playing?

REI	Briscola bastarda.

ILIR	It’s Italian. I picked it up when I was livingin Napoli.

REI	 Now he’s addicted. He doesn’t want to playanything else.

ELENA	So how do you play?

ILIR	Have we met?

ELENA	No. I’m sure I’d remember if we had.

ELENA	So, how do you play?

ILIR	This game is all about deception andmis direction.

ILIR	A Trump card is decided at the beginning of the game.

REI	Briscola is the Trump card.

ILIR	You can play alone or with a partner.

ILIR	The objective remains the same.

ILIR	Whoever gets to fifteen points first wins.

ILIR	Having a guy who will go in with you is a good way to throw the other players off.

ELENA	Unless your opponent sees through you.

ILIR	Yes, but it only happens if you don’t know what you’re doing.

ILIR	You guys look thirsty.

ILIR	Vodka?

REI	Be careful. Briscola bastarda with five people is a completely different game.

ELENA	I’m confused.

ILIR	Yes.

ILIR	It’s a confusing game.

ELENA	It still sounds fun. Can we play?

ILIR	Of course.

ILIR	Come on, you’ve been playing since you walked through the fucking door!

REI	Wait.

LORIK	Take that fucking gun off his head.

KOLO	Wait wait!

REI	ILIR, what is it, man?

ILIR	They are not here for a deal, man.

ELENA	What are you talking about! Everybody calm down.

ILIR	Don’t tell me to fucking calm down!

ILIR	These assholes are cops!

ILIR	Some piece of shit traitor in our crew has been feeding them information!

ILIR	You want to get out of here tonight alive?

ILIR	Tell me exactly who the fuck it is!

ENCI	I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about, man!

REI	Wait! Just wait a minute, man.

REI	Just take it easy. Okay, take it easy.

ILIR	This isn’t about us, man. It’s all about Padulla.

ILIR	They’re trying to get him through us. Don’t you fucking understand?

REI	Even if they’re cops, my brother...

REI	You can’t afford to kill them. Do you understand that?

ILIR	When did you start worrying about fucking pigs?

REI	Seriously? Are you trying to tell me something?

ILIR	Maybe!

REI	You’re kidding me, right? After everything we’ve been through?

REI	I’ll give this one to you because this is some stressful shit.

REI	And you’re my friend.

REI	You want to see loyalty?

REI	I’ll show you loyalty.

REI	Give me the gun.

REI	Give me the gun.

REI	Come on give me the fucking gun!

REI	I don’t give a fuck if they’re cops, my brother.

REI	But if we kill them we bring down heat that we don’t need.

REI	But hey, you’re the boss, right?

REI	And I’m here because I know how to get things done.

REI	You’ve always been a good judge of character, right my brother?

ELENA	Hold your fire!

ELENA	Don’t move.

REI	Well done, geniuses. You got me.

REI	REI Cana, Renea, ID number .

REI	Ouch.

ENCI	Thank you for that.

ENCI	I’ve gotta work on not catching punches with my face though.

REI	I tell you what, pal, I hear that once you start it’s very difficult to stop.

ENCI	Thanks for the tip, dad.

LORIK	Are you guys done?

ELENA	Lieutenant, why weren’t we told there was an undercover working ILIR ?

ERMAL	It was need to know.

KOLO	After last night I’m thinking we need to know.

ERMAL	Well as proud as I am about how far ourdepartment has come over the years there are still far too many leaks.

ELENA	With all due respect, I think we’ve earnedyour trust, sir.

ERMAL	If it makes you feel any better, I wasn’tinformed either.

ERMAL	Until CAPTAIN AGIM	 here just briefed me.

KOLO	How do we know this guy isn’t playing both sides?

REI	How do I know you’re not as dumb as you look?

REI	Then, hey, kudos BOY	s and girls.

LORIK	Screw you, man.

ELENA	If there was proper communication between both departments, shit like last night wouldn’t have happened.

REI	I can show you where to put that.

KOLO	You think so?

REI	Try me.

ERMAL	That’s enough.

ERMAL	We all want the same thing. Let’s not forget that.

ERMAL	Officers, from now on you are to report to Captain Hoxha.

CAPTAIN AGIM	We have to restore our confidence and faith in justice in our citizens.

ENCI	Really. That’s all?

CAPTAIN AGIM	There is a push from the Parliament to propose that our country be a member state of the European Union.

CAPTAIN AGIM	And to do this, we need to clean out some garbage.

LORIK	And how do you plan on doing that?

CAPTAIN AGIM	By systematically breaking down each of the individuals responsible.

CAPTAIN AGIM	We will intercept and destroy their business operations from within.

KOLO	Who are we targeting?

CAPTAIN AGIM	Frank Padulla. He’s pulling all the strings.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Italian American, operating out from the United States.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Nothing goes down in Albania without his say so.

CAPTAIN AGIM	And we do that by pinning down the guys in charge of his domestic businesses ere.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Besnick Shehu. The heart of Padulla’s operation in the country.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He’s the right hand man.

ELENA	Like ILIR.

CAPTAIN AGIM	ILIR is just a low level soldier.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He pushes prostitution and drugs into the clubs and streets.

CAPTAIN AGIM	But he knows some things.

CAPTAIN AGIM	And we are going to find out what those things are.

ILIR	And we are going to find out what those things are.

PEDULLA	Feeding three thousand Albanians every day?

CAPTAIN AGIM	Come on.

CAPTAIN AGIM	We both know who you are and what you do.

PEDULLA	Hey listen…

PEDULLA	There’s a few kings, and there’s a lot of desperate men.

CAPTAIN AGIM	The only ones who will benefit from all of this are the Albanian people.

PEDULLA	How?

PEDULLA	What’s changed?

PEDULLA	It’s the same.

PEDULLA	Same Albanian citizens, same politicians, same vows.

PEDULLA	You abandon your vow to protect and to serve.

PEDULLA	Now you have no running water. No roads, no laws, no infrastructure.

PEDULLA	No nothing. That was you, Agim.

PEDULLA	That was you and your deficient government.

PEDULLA	Yeah, and you want to learn a blind eye and look the other way?

PEDULLA	I built the pipeline here, pal.

PEDULLA	That’s mine.

PEDULLA	I get to keep it.

PEDULLA	I got the scars to prove it.

PEDULLA	So let’s not go there.

PEDULLA	All right? Who you got? You got fat.

PEDULLA	You all got fat, come on.

CAPTAIN AGIM	You know what?

CAPTAIN AGIM	Sometimes I think you forget something.

CAPTAIN AGIM	That Albania made you…

CAPTAIN AGIM	Not the other way around.

CAPTAIN AGIM	And just because your passport is blue, doesn’t make you untouchable.

CAPTAIN AGIM	We are set on righting our wrongs.

PEDULLA	You’re setting it right? Well that sounds like a plan. Geez…

PEDULLA	Take your swat team here and throw them right the fuck in this jail right now.

PEDULLA	And you set a right. [LAUGHS]

PEDULLA	And what do you think?

PEDULLA	You think the people who are pulling the strings here…

PEDULLA	You honestly believe they’re not criminals?

CAPTAIN AGIM	They didn’t commit murder.

PEDULLA 	They didn’t?

PEDULLA	Well where were you in ’?

PEDULLA	What were you doing?

PEDULLA	Were you singing with the Albanian quire?

PEDULLA	That wasn’t your little finger on the trigger?

PEDULLA	Well whose was it then?

PEDULLA	I’ll tell you whose.

PEDULLA	It was yours and mine, Jimbo.

PEDULLA	Yeah, it was ours.

PEDULLA	And you want to know why?

PEDULLA	Because we gave this country something.

PEDULLA	We gave it stability. We gave it an economy.

PEDULLA	We gave it hope.

PEDULLA	And four and a half billion a year.

PEDULLA	FOUR and one half billion a year.

PEDULLA	Yeah. Now what do you think?

PEDULLA	You think your politicians don’t want to get their dicks wet in that?

CAPTAIN AGIM	The Minister of the Interior is targeting all of your steps.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Everything and everyone associated will go down with you.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Brittel included.

CAPTAIN AGIM	You will answer for your actions.

PEDULLA	My actions?

PEDULLA	My actions?

PEDULLA	You know what’s funny?

PEDULLA	You once came running to me.

PEDULLA	Because you treated these people here like dogs.

PEDULLA	You know what you are now?

PEDULLA	You’re a tick…

PEDULLA	In the neck of the dogs.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He controls the game.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He wanted to make sure that we knew that.

REI	We had him.

REI	And you let him go.

CAPTAIN AGIM	What were we going to hold him for?

CAPTAIN AGIM	The warehouse was empty.

REI	What about ILIR?

CAPTAIN AGIM	Yeah, he’s a start.

CAPTAIN AGIM	But we need more than the word of a snitch in trouble looking for immunity.

CAPTAIN AGIM	This runs deep.

CAPTAIN AGIM	People in very powerful positions are involved.

CAPTAIN AGIM	If we want to pin him down for good we have to play this smart.

VOICE ON PHONE	Did you see Besi?

PEDULLA	No.

VOICE ON PHONE	What about ILIR?

PEDULLA	No.

VOICE ON PHONE	Want me to take care of him?

PEDULLA	Come on.

REI	Good morning.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Hey.

REI	Bad time?

CAPTAIN AGIM	No. Come in.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Sit down.

REI	So…REI	Tell me the history.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Well, Frank was a friend of mine.

CAPTAIN AGIM	A good one.

REI	Okay.

REI	But why didn’t you tell the team?

REI	Why didn’t you tell me?

CAPTAIN AGIM	That was a long time ago.

CAPTAIN AGIM	In another life.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Frank was an American marine.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He served in Vietnam.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He worked as a contractor helping Albania and Kosovo…

CAPTAIN AGIM	During the civil war.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Training KLA.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He saved a lot of lives at that time.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Mine included.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He helped liberate our nation.

CAPTAIN AGIM	After the war he saw an opportunity in Albania.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He made it his home…

CAPTAIN AGIM	And created an empire.

REI	So he’s a hero.

CAPTAIN AGIM	He used to be.

REI	It’s because of people like that that my parents are gone.

REI	It’s why you lost your brother.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Have faith in the system.

REI	[ANGRY SIGH]

CAPTAIN AGIM	Albania is changing, REI	.

CAPTAIN AGIM	And mostly because of people like yourself.

CAPTAIN AGIM	People brave enough to clean up the mess we’ve made.

REI	No. Not me. I’m not that optimistic.

CAPTAIN AGIM	But you have to be.

CAPTAIN AGIM	There is no other way.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Trust in the law and justice…

CAPTAIN AGIM	In your people. In your home.

CAPTAIN AGIM	You can’t lose your way.

REI	Yeah.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Hey.

CAPTAIN AGIM	One last thing…

CAPTAIN AGIM	With all of our security issues I’ve made a decision to transfer Besi and ILIR…

CAPTAIN AGIM	…to a maximum security prison.

REI	Smart.

REI	Look, if Agim says he wants more we give him more.

KOLO	What do you mean?

REI	I mean we do whatever has to be done.

REI	ILIR told us that if we want Pedulla we need to get Besnick.

REI	If Besnick really is in charge of shipping and operations then he has the records.

REI	ILIR told us that if we want Pedulla we need to get Besnick.

REI	Weigh bills, shipping manifests, contact lists that will lead us directly to the customs officials that they have on their payroll.

REI	This is exactly what we need to tighten the noose on Pedulla.

REI	So…

REI	I say we hit Besnick.

REI	I say we hit him tonight.

REI	Who’s in?

ELENA	I am.

ENCI	Absolutely.

ENCI	Why not?

REI	Are you sure you’re good with this?

ELENA	Yes.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Good luck.

CAPTAIN AGIM	Stay safe.

REI	You too.

KOLO	They transferring them?

REI	Yup. Maximum security. 

REI	Come on. Let’s move. 

ELENA	What’s going on? 

REI	Who knows? 

REI	Let’s move! 

REI	Okay. 

REI	We’ll enter his building through the back.  There’s a side entrance.

REI	It’s big, so we stay close.

ENCI	What are we expecting?

REI	It will be light. Two or three people tops.

REI	Now remember, it’s where he works, not where he keeps his product.

REI	Let’s just call it his pleasure pack.

REI	A place where he likes to entertain his friends.

REI	Again, it’s big so we stay close.

REI	Copy?

ENCI	Copy.

REI	Understood?

REI	Let’s move.

REI	This way.

REI	Let’s go.

REI	Come on. Come on. Let’s go.

REI	Go! Go! Move!

ELENA	Go.

ELENA	It’s okay.

ELENA	We’re here to help.

ELENA	What’s your name?

PROSTITUTE	Gerta.

ELENA	Gerta.

ELENA	Where is he?

PROSTITUTE	There.

REI	Where’s ELENA?

ENCI	She was right behind me.

REI	Fuck!

BESNICK	Drop it.

BESNICK	Drop it.

BESNICK	Well…

BESNICK	Well…

BESNICK	Well…

BESNICK	Gerta.

BESNICK	It’s been so long.

BESNICK	Oh, how I’ve missed you.

BESNICK	I knew you’d come back.

BESNICK	They always do, you know.

BESNICK	You all pretend you don’t like it but…

BESNICK	Whores…they are what they are.

BESNICK	They need a daddy…

BESNICK	…to take care of them.

BESNICK	Don’t they?

BESNICK	Bitch!

ELENA	[GROAN]

REI	Fuck!

ENCI	Hey, come off it! What the fuck are you doing? Get away!

KOLO	I had no choice.

KOLO	No. I had a choice.

KOLO	I have it.

MAYOR V.O.	Today marks one of the darkest days in our nation’s history.

MAYOR V.O.	While we still don’t know all the facts, what we do know is that there has been a vicious…

MAYOR V.O.	…calculated, and despicable attack against our law enforcement.

MAYOR V.O.	We vow that we will not stop until all of those responseible…

MAYOR V.O.	…are brought to justice for this horrific atrocity.

REI	He killed NICO.

ELENA	Yes but he was shot.

REI	Yeah.

REI	In the report it said he had powder burns on his shirt. 

REI	[ANGRY YELL]

ELENA	REI!

REI	He must have done that to himself just to back up his story.
