WOMAN	Oh, yeah Uh-huh

??	Woken by the waves as they’re rolling in

??	Blue skies all I can see

??	I wanna feel the sunshine on my skin

??	Riding high on a breeze

FEMALE BACKUP SINGERS	Saw you passing me by

??	I want you    to catch my eye

??	Reckon that you like the way I move

??	Accompany me    onto the floor

??	I’ll keep asking    for more

??	Livin’ for tonight I’m meant to move

??	We ride    on a wave together

??	Lost forever

??	Far away from home

??	You show me    a brand-new rhythm

??	Sunshine ever

??	Made for us to roam

??	To my surprise

??	Love never dies

??	You play me the sound of some other time

??	You play me the sound of some other time?

??	Ooh, a little early, isn’t it?

??	Well, you know what they say.

??	It’s always: happy hour somewhere.

??	Should I make you one?

??	Tempting offer, um, but I have to go home and meet Cat

??	before I go back to the club.

??	Nice bikini.

??	Anyone ever tell you you don’t look like an accountant?

??	I brought last night’s receipts.

??	So how was business last night?

??	You know, I’ve got to hand it to you guys. A pop-up club?

??	The clients love it because it’s invitation only and they feel special.

??	Hmm. Business is good  because it’s cash only. 

??	It’s temporary. You make your money and move on.

??	It’s really a thing of beauty.

??	Till the tax man catches on.

??	Ooh.

??	That’s why we have you and your brilliant mind-- to match that hot body.

??	And last night?

??	Oh, it was strange. I’m still kind of upset.

??	You’re not listening, are you?

??	Come on.

??	Look at that.

??	Feast your eyes.

??	He’s yummy, huh?

??	I have to admit, you’re right.

??	Join us?

??	Uh, no, no.

??	Uh, you guys go ahead and have fun.

??	Are you sure you’re okay? You seem really quiet.

??	Yeah, I’m okay.

??	Well, I’m here if you wanna talk.

??	You mind if I just hang out inside for a while, alone?

??	My house is your house.

??	Have fun.

??	Oh, yeah, baby. Mmm.

??	Yeah, baby.

??	Oh, baby.

??	Yeah, baby.

??	Come here, baby.

??	God.

??	Yeah, baby.

??	Yeah.

??	Baby.

??	Yeah.

??	Yeah, baby.

??	Oh, baby.

??	Oh, fuck.

??	Oh, f--

??	Baby.

??	Yeah. Fuck.

??	You’re amazing.
	
??	You’re not so bad yourself.

??	Is that a hint?

??	What, you’re in such a hurry for me to leave already?

??	Actually, yeah.

??	I wanna talk to Shay. I think something’s wrong.

??	Nothing like being second.

??	There’s more where that came from. But later. I promise.

??	Now go.

??	He leaving already?

??	Yeah. I wanted to check on you, make sure you’re all right.

??	I’m fine. Really.

??	Thanks for letting me   hang out.

??	Yeah.

??	Shay, what’s that on your bag?

??	Is that blood?

??	What? Um, it’s nothing.

??	No. Sit.

??	You’re gonna tell me what’s going on?

??	I’m your friend. I promise I won’t repeat anything you tell me.

??	Well, it all started last night.

??	I was dancing.

??	I saw Cat take this guy into the back room.

??	Back rooms? Is that usual?

??	Niko has some high roller clients,

??	and they get special treatment.

??	So I wasn’t surprised.

??	Cat knew what she was doing.

??	I mean, we all know what goes on in back rooms.

??	Now, this is much better.

??	I couldn’t even hear myself think out there.

??	Yeah.

??	To Niko. Why Niko?

??	Well, he knows me better than just about anyone-- other than his girlfriend--

??	and he thought we should meet.

??	Hmm. Does Niko introduce you to many guys? Come on, John.

??	You seem like a really nice guy

??	and someone I would definitely like to get to know better,

??	so I’m gonna pretend that you didn’t ask me that question,

??	and I’m gonna ask you if you saw me dance.

??	Actually, I did.

??	That’s why I wanted to meet you.

??	And why we will get along so well.

??	Come here.

??	Let’s get this off, okay?

??	Fuck.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Let me go in first, okay?

??	Otherwise, the members might get the wrong idea.

??	Oh, uh--

??	Mmm.

??	I’m really glad I met you. Me too.

??	So, what happened?

??	It was just like any other night.

??	I was dancing,

??	and then everyone was gone, and we were wrapping up for the night,

??	and I went in the back room to get my bag.

??	And I saw him.

??	Shay, what’s wrong?

??	There’s somebody-- There’s someone--

??	There shouldn’t be. He’s--

??	Was he dead? I mean, we’re not really sure what happened.

??	Um, it was awful though. Um--

??	It’s like maybe he passed out on his head or something.

??	Shay?

??	Here, here, here, here.

??	Cat, when did you leave John?

??	I don’t know. About an hour ago.

??	Was there anyone with you? Was there anyone in the hallway?

??	What are you talking about, Niko?

??	Someone hit him in the back of the head. 

CAT	You need to go help him.

??	Why aren’t you helping him?

??	Priorities.

??	He’s dead, Cat.

??	I saw him.

??	We need to call the police.

??	No. No, Cat. They can’t know about the pop-up.

??	If they do,  they will shut us down.

??	I mean, who cares about a damn club?

??	No, no, no. I care. They’re not gonna shut us down.We’ll go to jail.

??	It’s a pop-up strip club. This is a man’s life.

??	A man you just fucked.

??	How are you gonna explain any of this?

??	We run without a license, we sell booze 

??	and you get your jollies stripping for cash.

??	And none of it gets taxed.

??	Once the police are done with us,

??	the IRS and the state regulatory agencies

??	are gonna have a fucking field day.

??	Cat, take Shay home.

??	I’ll be by when I’m done here.

??	What are you gonna do?

??	What I have to do to keep us all out of jail.

??	But you can’t do it alone. I’ll stay and help.

??	You don’t have to.

??	I know, but neither do you.

??	Be careful.

??	Come on, Shay.

??	You should’ve gone to the police.

??	Cat and I left.

??	Georgia said that she was gonna stay and help Niko.

??	We don’t even know what happened.

??	I haven’t talked to either of them since.

??	Wait. So you left Georgia alone with Niko?

??	She’s such a snake.

??	Well, I trust Niko. Why shouldn’t I?

??	You’re so naive.

??	SHAY:I’m sure nothing happened.

??	Besides, that’s the least of the problems, right?

??	Is that what you wanted? Is that what you wanted?

??	Dirty little girl. You like fucking that, don’t you?

??	This is serious. You should’ve insisted on going to the cops.

??	I knew I shouldn’t have told you. You don’t understand.

??	You know, I’m pretty sure you can be considered an accomplice.

??	You just don’t get it. Niko was right.

??	We can’t risk drawing attention to the club.

??	It’s totally illegal.

??	No permits. No taxes. Nothing.

??	You know, I don’t-- I don’t know if I’m comfortable with all of this.

??	I mean, I’m already walking the line by doing the books under the table.

??	I understand.

??	I mean, I can’t have cops coming around.

??	I don’t wanna be involved.

??	I’m not gonna leave you hanging,

??	but after tonight you’re gonna have to find someone else.

??	Um, all right.

??	I-- I understand.

??	Um, I’ll drop off the final paperwork later.

??	Deeper. Deeper, please.

??	We really are a perfect pair, aren’t we?

??	Look, I’m on my way. I’ll see you in a few minutes.

??	Your clothes are almost dry.

??	Lock up. Toss the key under the mat when you’re done.

??	Oh, but I wanna stay.

??	Well, you can’t.

??	Why are you with her?

??	I mean, you know you like sex with me better.

??	Georgia, I’m not having this discussion right now.

??	Okay.

??	So... let’s have the conversation

??	about how you just moved a dead body instead.

??	We> just did.

??	And don’t go there, ’cause it won’t end well.

??	Yeah, you know what? Neither will this.

CAT	We need to hire another bouncer.

??	We already have two. Niko’s not gonna pay for a third one.

??	He’s making so much money off of us, it’s sick.

??	We’re a pop-up for rich, bored fucks 

??	in a city that won’t serve booze,
 
??	in an all-nude club,

??	which makes us practically gold miners.
 
??	He can afford to throw a little extra cash our way

??	so we can feel safe.

??	That’s what Chad and Blake are for.

??	Oh, yeah, and a lot of good that did.

??	What is it you suggest, Cat?

??	Niko, I just wanna feel safe.

??	Okay, Chad’s in the front lettin’ people in.

??	You and Blake are making sure that there’s no fights.

??	I wanna make sure that there’s someone there to guard us.

??	Do you feel the same way?

??	The good nights are fun.

??	Bad ones, not so much.

??	Fine. For you.

??	Good. I’ll put it on the message boards.

??	Don’t I get a say in this? No.

??	You write the checks, Niko,

??	but we’re hiring another bouncer.

??	Okay, fine, but if he steals from me, it’s on you.

??	Fine.

??	I’m gonna go upstairs and take a bath with a nice bottle of wine.

??	I’ll see you guys later.

??	What did you guys do with-- It’s handled.

??	Who did this, Niko?

??	I-- I-- I don’t know.

??	Look--

??	You know, maybe-- maybe it was an accident.

??	Maybe he slipped, cracked his head on the concrete floor.

??	In fact, that is> what happened.

??	He fell down, cracked his head on the concrete floor,

??	and that’s it.

??	I just don’t wanna go down that path anymore.

??	You really think it was an accident?

??	I do. I really do,

??	because anything else puts it squarely in Cat’s court.

??	How about you? How are you holding up?

??	I’ve had better nights.

??	You’re like this fragile little teacup

??	that’s really made out of steel.

??	Is that supposed to be some kind of compliment?

??	No. This is.

??	Mmm.

??	Thank you for last night.

??	You don’t have to thank me. I didn’t do it for you.

??	You helped Niko. That counts.

??	Hey.
 
??	One of you girls Cat? I’m here about the security gig.

??	I’m Cat.

??	Mac. Nice to meet you.

??	I’m Georgia.

??	And, uh, you are exactly what we have been looking for.

??	You don’t agree?

??	Not yet. Fair enough.

CAT	So, Mac,

??	what kind of security work have you done?

??	SHAY: So the girls all agree about John.

??	Even though it’s not the right thing to do, we’re gonna let it go.

??	It’s the right decision for the club.

SHAY	They don’t know that you and I are partners in this club though, do they?

??	I’m not cutting that pie into any more slices.

??	I’m gonna have to shell out for this bozo, and I’m not happy about it.

??	I’ll pay.

??	Come again?

??	I’ll pay his salary out of my share.

??	I’ve never seen the girls look so relaxed,

??	and we need the extra security.

SHAY	But you can’t tell any of them.

??	Your dime, your secret, Shay.

??	What’s all this?

??	Just packing up the files, getting them ready for Shay.

??	Did I miss something?

??	I-- I thought you didn’t work with her anymore.

??	Yeah, I can’t say too much about it, but I am out.

??	Your choice... or hers?

??	We both agreed not to work together anymore.

??	Let’s just say that club that they’re running

??	is right on the wrong side of the line, and...

??	I don’t want any problems.

??	Smart girl.

??	Only thing I’m gonna miss is Shay.

??	Yeah. I liked her.

??	I think you’re making the right decision.

??	I hope she’s gonna be okay.

??	Hey. I seem to remember a promise you made me.

??	You mean that?

??	It’s exactly what I mean.

??	Oh, yeah, baby.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, baby.

??	Yeah.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Yes.

??	Yes.

??	 The guy in the corneris getting ready to cut out on his tab.

??	I’ll go talk to him.

MAN	Yeah

??	Yeah

??	Hey! Why don’t youstep up the bar, and we’ll talk.

??	Yeah

??	Yeah

??	Yeah

??	Yeah

??	Yeah

??	Yeah

??	What did you say to him?

??	I told him that we had his credit card on file,  and all we needed was his signature so he could settle up on his drinks.

??	Unless, of course, he wanted to pay cash,

??	in which case I would give him a free one.

??	You don’t have his credit card on file, do you?

??	No.

??	But it’s about to become our policy.

??	Yeah?

??	Yeah!

??	Ow!

??	You know, he hasn’t taken his eyes off her all night.

??	He’s just doing his job.

??	Stop trying to stir up trouble.

??	Okay.

??	Then, um, why does she keep looking for him in the crowd?

??	What’s going on? What did I do?

??	You like it.

??	Niko, wait. You’re mine.

??	You make me feel so fucking good.

??	Yes.

??	I love watching you dance. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

??	Oh, fuck.

??	There it is. There it is.

NIKO	Just stay right there. Stay right there.

??	Stay right there.

??	Oh, that’s it.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Come on, baby. Yes. Yes.

??	Oh, fuck.

??	Oh, fuck.

??	Yeah. Yeah.

??	Yes. Yes, please.

??	You shouldn’t let him do that.

??	Mac, you scared me.

??	You shouldn’t let Niko pull you off the stage like that.

??	Look, whatever I do in my private life is none of your business,

??	so you can save that white knight routine  for somebody else.

??	Yeah. Well, you make itmy business

??	when you put your tongue down some guy’s throat right when you finish dancing.

??	Because now every guy in there is gonna wanna do the same thing to you.

??	And my job just got  times harder.

??	I can take care of myself.

??	No doubt. But that’s what you’re paying me for.

??	These guys are used to buying their ways in and out of all kinds of situations.

??	We need them to know that here the rules are different. All right?

??	I’m sorry, Mac. It won’t happen again.

??	All right.

??	It’s okay.

??	Was that necessary?

??	I’m not gonna apologize for doing my job.

??	What was that for?

??	Well, you protected me.

??	Yeah, I get paid to.

??	Well, thank you, Mac.

??	I know how to appreciate manhandling, unlike some people.

??	Which people do you mean?

??	Well, Shay, of course.

??	I don’t understand why she cares whether the customer comes back.

??	It’s not like there isn’t somebody else waiting in line to take their place.

??	So that’s how the club makes its money--

??	by selling some kind of membership.

??	Well, Niko handles the business. It’s his place.

??	We just dance here.

??	Yeah. Why do you> dance?

??	Well, why not?

??	I used to be a stockbroker’s assistant,

??	which is where I met all the girls.

??	But I make far better money here

??	than kissing some high-powered bitch’s ass.

??	Plus, I like to have my days free to sleep.

??	What about Shay and Cat? Why do they do it?

??	Well, they’re both still junior traders.

??	They only got into it because it’s fun.

??	But I think Shay does what Niko tells her to do.

??	And Cat’s trying to put herself through college.

??	You think Shay wouldn’t dance if she wasn’t with Niko anymore?

??	Why do you care what Shay does?

??	All she cares about is bending over for Niko.

??	Fuck me?

GEORGIA	Come here. Come here.

??	Yes. Yes.
	
??	Okay.

??	Look at me.

??	I like the new guy. He knows what he’s doing.

??	What are you playing at, Georgia?

??	There are no games with me, Niko.

??	When I see something I want, I go for it. No games.

??	Then I just made a rule: no sleeping with the help.

??	Yeah. You know what? Let me know how that goes for you and Shay.

??	She fills this place-- Where the-- Where are you going?

??	Come on, Shay.  Let’s get out of here.

??	I’m going to my place, alone.

??	You heard her, Cat. She wants to be alone.

??	You get to sleep in the penthouse.

??	I’ll grab my bag.

??	Take me home, Mac.

??	Let me ake you home, Shay.

??	What about me?

??	Shay. You shouldn’t be driving right now.

??	I’m fine.

??	Well, Jesus Christ. What am I, invisible?

??	Shay. Forget about that rat bastard. He’s an asshole.

??	You can do better.

??	Jesus. Just get on with it.

??	Thanks, hon.

??	So, what about us, Mac?

??	There is no us.

??	Come on. I’ll walk you to your car.

??	You know what? Don’t bother.

??	Why don’t you go chase after your fragile one?

??	Jesus. That’s all you guys want anyway--

??	just someone who’s gonna bend over for you. 

??	It’s time for you to leave.

??	No. Georgia.

??	I got to lock up.

??	Shay, is everything all right?

??	You must think I’m such an idiot.

??	You’re definitely not the stupid one in this.

??	It didn’t use to suck.

??	It sucks now?

??	Well, I didn’t exactly sign up for a possessive-jerk,

??	"sleep with my roommate" type of boyfriend.

??	Good to know.

??	Why is that good to know?

??	Well, I respect you.

??	It’d bum me out to have my illusions shattered.

??	I’m gonna go. Oh. Let me walk you out.

??	It’s open.

??	Hey, Shay.

??	Oh, God. I thought you were Niko.

??	Jason, what are you doing here? It’s been like two years.

??	Well, more like  months,

??	six days, seven hours and about  minutes.

??	But you know, who’s counting?

??	Why are you here?

??	I saw you dancing last night, and--

??	I missed you.

??	You should go. I’m in a relationship now.

??	Yeah, that’s right. With that Niko dude, right?

??	The guy I saw leaving with that pretty little blonde?

??	Last night.

??	But look, none of that matters.

??	I missed you.

??	You look so pretty.

??	We shouldn’t.

??	Oh, yeah, we can.

??	Oh, nice.

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

MAN	I light the fire

??	And wait here alone

??	Empty house, empty home

??	Strange sounds

??	Bounce down the halls

??	The paint is peeling from the walls

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,   ooh, ooh, ooh

??	Angels in the breeze

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	By candlelight

??	I hold your photo frame

??	A broken heart   is hard to change

??	I drink until

??	I feel your lips on mine

??	Waiting for love

??	Waiting on mine

??	Listen at the window

??	Feel the angels in the breeze

??	They whisper in the night

??	Through the trees

??	Get by and warmed by

??	The fire in the ring

??	Waiting for love that never came

??	Never came

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	Angels in the breeze

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,

??	ooh, ooh, ooh

??	Angels in the breeze

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	You should never hurt again

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	Angels in the breeze

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	Angels in the breeze

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  Angels

??	Angels

??	Angels in the breeze

??	Oh, fuck.

??	Oh, yes.

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	Oh, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	I light the fire

??	And wait here alone

??	Empty house, empty home

??	Strange sounds

??	Bounce down the hall

??	The paint is peeling from the walls 

??	Oh, my God.

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	Angels in the breeze

??	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

??	Oh, fuck.

??	By candlelight

??	I hold your photo frame

??	A broken heart is hard to change 

??	I dream until

??	I feel your lips on mine

??	Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yeah. Yes.

??	Waiting for love

??	Listen at the window

??	 (grunting)

??	Whispers in the night

??	Through the trees

??	Get by and warmed by

??	The fire in the--

??	Oh, shit.

??	This shouldn’t have happened.

??	You have to go.

??	Come on, Shay.

??	We were good once.

??	Let’s give another go at it.

??	I’ve moved on.

??	Yeah. I really don’t think it’s that Niko guy.

??	I think it’s something or someone else.

??	’Cause where I’m standing, he’s definitely not the guy for you.

??	You’re right.

??	There is someone.

??	I wasn’t sure, but I am now.

??	Do you understand?

??	I do.

??	Shay, all I ever wanted is for you to be happy.

??	That’s all.

??	Hmm.

??	 (clears throat)

??	Want some?

??	Still mad?

??	Just tired.

??	Why am I here?

??	You tell me.

??	Well, I was kind of hoping things were done with you and Shay.

??	Why?

??	Because I like you.

??	You like me?

??	Yeah, I do.

??	Does Shay know how you feel?

??	It may be slightly masochistic to want my roommate’s boyfriend,

??	but I’m not cruel.

??	And plus, I--

??	And?

??	And I’ve seen you and Shay together.

??	I think that you’re only with her because she’s nice

??	and you don’t want to hurt her.

??	But you haven’t loved her for a long time.

??	You think you know me that well?

??	I do.

??	I mean, there’s a fire in you that Shay can’t match.

??	You need a partner,

??	someone who’s strong enough to handle your moods

??	and fierce enough to seduce them when you’re in them.

??	And that’s you?

??	Yeah. That’s me.

??	And stop doing, fucking-- whatever is going on-- with Georgia.

??	Hmm. That one’s crazy.

??	God.

??	It’s really close.

??	I’m coming.

??	We need to talk.

??	What’s going on?

??	I want you to give Cat my half of the business.

??	I don’t get it.

??	I need to stop doing this.

??	I can’t be here anymore,

??	and I can’t be with you.

??	We’re good together.

??	I’m not sure we ever were.

??	Be happy, Niko.

??	Shay, I’m not even sure I wanna be with Cat.

??	She’s been in love with you ever since I’ve known her.

??	She’s a good match.

??	Just do me a favor and don’t stay at our place for a couple of weeks.

??	I don’t think I’m strong enough for that.

??	Shay, if you’re serious about this, will you do me a favor?

??	Will you dance tonight? It’s my favorite thing about running this club.

??	One last time.

??	Whoo!

??	Wow. Hey, come-- What? What?

SHAY	Mac, no! What the hell?

??	What the hell? Mac, no. MAN: I was just talking to her.

??	I’m done here, Mac. We’re not together anymore.

??	What, done dancing?

??	Done with Niko. Done with dancing.

??	I don’t need a white knight anymore.

??	No. Now more than ever.

NIKO	Stay down.

??	Georgia!

??	What are you doing, Mac?

??	Get off me!

??	What the hell?


??	She tried to kill us.

??	It was you. You killed John.

??	You hit him in the back of the head, and then you stayed behind

??	to help Niko clean up the evidence.

??	You are so twisted.

??	No, you’re the one who’s twisted.

??	I’ve been fucking Niko for months,

??	hoping you’d figure it out and you could fucking leave his ass.

??	But no-- no, you’re just too fucking stupid.

??	And then when you finally do leave him--

??	when you finally do, you try to take Mac from me too?

??	I couldn’t live with that, now, could I?

MAC	Call the cops.

??	Oh, yeah. Go ahead, Niko. Call them.

??	I will tell them-- I will tell them

??	how we hid a body in the Dumpster

??	and how you told me I would end up in the same spot if I told anybody.

??	Georgia, you’re insane.

??	Are you sure about that? ’Cause Niko was with me that night.

??	No. No, no, no, no. He was with me.

??	Really? Can you prove it?

??	Did anybody see you?

??	’Cause Niko here drove me home,

??	and he was at my apartment all night.

??	I can vouch for that. 

??	What do you wanna do here?

??	Well, I’m leaving the club, so this is not my problem anymore.

??	I think it’s time for Cat and I to take our business someplace else.

??	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Our business?

NIKO	You can call the cops. You can press charges.

??	Or not. We’ll support you either way.

??	You know, if it was just us,

??	I might be inclined to write this down to jealousy.

??	She killed John.

??	Yeah. And you know what? He was a really nice guy, and he did not deserve that.

??	So call the cops, regardless of the potential heat?

??	Yeah. It’s the right thing to do.

??	No. No. No. No! No!

??	So, Shay, what did Niko mean when he said "our business"?

??	Niko and I were partners in this club,

??	and today I said I wanted to give you my shares.

??	Really?

??	You’re gonna make   a great business owner.

??	Wow.

??	I-- I guess I can’t be mad.

??	I mean, I never even knew you were my boss.

??	Pretty good plan, right? Yeah.

??	And, um, thanks for letting Niko go.

??	Thanks for hiring Mac.

??	Come here.

??	Georgia could probably make this pretty ugly for us still, huh?

??	Well, she could, but she’s clearly a nutcase.

??	And it’s her word against ours.

??	So you’d stand with us?

??	Well, I wasn’t there the night the other guy was killed.

??	I remember the conversation.

??	It was what happened after she tried to plant the crowbar on my head.

??	So I’ll be a little shaky on those details.

??	I have to say I am a little bit bummed

??	that she interrupted us.

??	Well, I could probably remember where we left off.

??	Oh, really? Show me.

??	Well, my mouth was—

??	Where?

??	Somewhere around...

??	Mmm. Here. 

??	And your arms were--

??	Right here? Yeah. Somewhere around there.

??	Like this? Are you sure?

??	Never been more sure of anything in my life.

??	Oh, yeah.

??	Mmm. Mm-hmm.

??	Goddamn.

??	Mmm.

??	Mmm.

??	Fuck, yeah.

??	Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

??	Mmm. Mmm.

??	Come here.

??	Yeah.

??	You’re so strong. You’re so strong.

??	Yes.

??	Yeah.

??	Ooh!

??	Oh, yes.

??	Yes, yes, yes, yes.

??	It’s nice. Yeah.

??	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

??	Oh, my God.

WOMAN	I’d swim the ocean blue

??	And walk from Everest   round to Kathmundu

??	For just one glimmer

??	Of your smile

??	The memory of your lips

??	And the hope   I’ll feel your fingertips

??	All from one glimmer

??	Of your smile

??	The memory of your lips

??	And the hope   I’ll feel your fingertips

??	All for one glimmer

??	Of your smile

??	Just for one glimmer of

??	Your smile
