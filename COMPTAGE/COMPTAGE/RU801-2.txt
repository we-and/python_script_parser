I got my drag name from Naomi Campbell and Biggie Smalls. First one, I don't blame them. I'm obsessed with 's supermodels. I'm gonna set myself right in the center. Yeah, spotlight on me. (laughs) Naomi is a fashion girl. She's [bleep] fierce.

CYNTHIA	Okay.

DAX	Can I get some brunch?

NAOMI	(laughs)

NAYSHA	Hola. The beauty is here. My name is Naysha Lopez. I think the most important element of my drag has to be appearance. It sounds so shallow, but my drag is flawless. It's gorgeous, it's stunning, it's gorgeous, it's everything. Did I say it was stunning and gorgeous? Did I say that already? Okay.

NAYSHA	I love me some Cynthia.

CYNTHIA	(whistles)

CYNTHIA	(whistles)

NAYSHA	Oh!

NAOMI	Oh!

ACID BETTY	No need to adjust your TV sets. This acid trip is all real.

ACID BETTY	Watch out bitches. Here's Acid Betty from Brooklyn, New York. My drag style is completely over-the-top. Basically, a drug trip without the drugs. I kind of want to run around. (laughs) The main bullet point of Acid Betty is she's a bitch. That's it. Even Bianca won't [bleep] with her. That's the T. Wait, I want to put my stink all over this place. I'm excited to be here. Come on, like, before we all hate each other.

ROBBIE	Good morning. I didn't realize this was happening today. My name is Robbie Turner and I'm the kindest queen you'll ever meet. I'm trying to give old classic Hollywood. Rita Hayworth hair, Jean Harlow robe. Gorgeous.

NAOMI	How long you been doing drag for?

ROBBIE	Going on .

ACID BETTY	 years of drag?

ROBBIE	I know, can you imagine? I'm only .

ROBBIE	I know I don't.

NAOMI	Yes!

DAX	Oh!

NAOMI	Yay!

ROBBIE	Oh, Kim Chi!

KIM CHI	I came to chop through the competition. My name is Kim Chi and I came here to destroy everyone. With my makeup. I'm known for crazy, over-the-top, pure anime fantasy. Oh, my God.

NAOMI	Hi, I'm Naomi. This is beautiful. Seeing Kim Chi on Instagram for so long, double-tapping everything, I'm [bleep] star struck.

KIM CHI	I want to go subtle with everything, so. I may come across as shy because I'm soft-spoken, but donut come for me because I'll destroy you. Get it, donut? (laughing)

THORGY	Whoo! Thorgy with a TH and orgy and I feel incredible. My name is Thorgy and I'm  years old. I'm not  years old. Where did that come from? I'm colorful, I'm fun, and I'm a fashion clown. Whoo!

BOB	Whoo!

ACID BETTY	Take it.

THORGY	Yeah, yeah, yeah!

ROBBIE	Too real.

BOB	New York, New York, New York, yeah, girl.

ROBBIE	Oh.

BOB	Maybe some of the other queens are, like, resentful that there's so much New York City representation. There's a reason New York City has some of the best drag queens in the world and that is a fact. This is a gag.

ACID BETTY	The children don't even know.

LAYLA	All right, ladies. Let's turn up the juice and see what shakes loose.

BOB	Uh-oh, this is trouble.

ROBBIE	Don't say "Beetlejuice" three times.

LAYLA	I'm Layla McQueen and I'm  years old. Layla is like a whorey, quasi-rock star. I don't want to say gothy, but like, gothy. Hi.

DAX	What'd she say?


CHI CHI	My name is Chi Chi DeVayne and I don't get ready, I stay ready.

ALL	Hi!

CHI CHI	Hey! My drag is that real Southern dragged out style of drag. Creole fish. It's like a whole 'nother level of drag right here. If you made it to "RuPaul's Drag Race," you made it, honey.

NAYSHA	Tell us about yourself.

CHI CHI	Well, I'm a cheap queen.

LAYLA	She's on a budget.

CHI CHI	Um, I don't mean cheap.

THORGY	Resourceful.

CHI CHI	Yeah, resourceful.

ROBBIE	Chi Chi walked in in a trash bag. Chi Chi will take herself out in a trash bag.

DERRICK	It's Derrick, bitch.

ACID BETTY	Yeah!

DERRICK	My name is Derrick Berry. I'm  years old. I may look angelic, but I am not that innocent. I'm a Britney Spears impersonator. I impersonate her six nights a week on the Las Vegas Strip. I would love to believe that I'm the best Britney in the world. That's what people say.

ROBBIE	Derrick, I'm so [bleep] excited.

DERRICK	Hey!

ROBBIE	How are you?

LAYLA	Derrick Berry is huge competition. She is a quasi-celebrity.

BOB	Hey, Derrick, I'm Bob.

DERRICK	All right, Bob and Derrick.

DAX	So, where you from?

DERRICK	Vegas girl.

THORGY	Vegas girl.

DERRICK	Yeah, so place your bets on me if you like to gamble.

BOB	Is Beyoncé scared of Britney? Then Bob ain't scared of Derrick.

DERRICK	Okay, I want to know who else did this. Who else has been carb-free for two weeks? (chuckles)

NAYSHA	Got it.

MATHU	Going to the challenge, we're looking for that spark of individuality and we want to see who knows how to get their cream to rise to the top. Face is on lock and go. Body. Face. Naysha Lopez was adorable, incredible energy and she seemed quite comfortable quite quickly.

RUPAUL	Why, she's covered in black cock.

RUPAUL	Queens of a feather, stick together. Acid Betty, we will see if you have what it takes to sit among the goddesses, all right?

ACID BETTY	Yes, RuPaul, very intimidating. Sitting next to these wannabe ass drag queens.

MATHU	Lovely. Beautiful.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty, your pussy's on fire. Chemical fire.

ACID BETTY	Is that--Oh, that's your face.

NAOMI	I have studied thousands fashion magazines. Just let me pose and I'm happy.

MATHU	She has come to model.

VIOLET	Naomi Smalls looks really hot. She has a great ass, great legs, but she does have cliff hangers. You see her toes, like, literally clinging onto the shoe. Boner killer.

MATHU	Show me the winner.

MATHU	Oh, okay, yeah.

THORGY	Grow in size. Whoo!

RUPAUL	Looking good, feeling Thorgeous. Chi Chi DeVayne.

CHI CHI	My goodness.

VIOLET	Garbage.

SHARON	You have no idea how many of those dresses Alaska left at my house.

RUPAUL	Really?

MATHU	Ready to run with the big dogs?

CHI CHI	I'm ready.

MATHU	Get it, trash.

RUPAUL	Prove to us that you're a champion.

MATHU	I'm gonna tell you something. When your skirt covers up your whole legs and just leaves two little feet at the bottom, it makes me want to laugh, 'cause it looks like you're this tall with little feet.

MATHU	Okay, that was my hot tip. Carry on.

RUPAUL	Oh, there she is.

MATHU	There she is. Nice.

RUPAUL	Pose the house down. Dax ExclamationPoint.

MATHU	Gorgeous.

RUPAUL	You own everything. Next, Bob the Drag Queen. Little Kim up in the house.

MATHU	She's trying to keep it fresh and clean.

RUPAUL	Yes.

BOB	Slappin' with Raja.

RAJA	Hey.

RUPAUL	Yeah, you got two more left.

BOB	I'll just looked shocked.

BOB	How about we do like that black and white photo where no one...

MATHU	Nice. Just keeping it editorial, real and art.

RUPAUL	Yes. Thank you.

JINKX	I saw the tights and they were ripped.

RUPAUL	Next up, Layla McQueen.

MATHU	Ready, boom.

RUPAUL	Oh, okay.

MATHU	You remind me of a dog trying to get comfortable on the couch.

LAYLA	Everyone is so gorgeous and here I am looking like a Beetlejuice trash bag and oh, my God. It's intimidating for sure. I can go anywhere?

RUPAUL	Yeah, sure, yeah.

BEBE	Anywhere you want, girl.

MATHU	Ready, here we go.

RUPAUL	Oh, a nice. She's a shy girl.

JINKX	Layla McQueen, I could have used a little more enthusiasm from her.

MATHU	She's like the Hamburglar scurrying around behind people.

RUPAUL	Earn those stripes, girl. From Las Vegas, Nevada, Derrick Berry.

SHARON	It's Britney, witch. (laughs)

MATHU	That's it, make them your backup dancers.

RUPAUL	Yes, you're gonna work this whole set, aren't you?

DERRICK	You know it.

MATHU	Atta girl.

DERRICK	Can I take this?

RUPAUL	Sure, why not.

DERRICK	Yeah.

RUPAUL	Yeah, you seem stronger than yesterday.

SHARON	Derrick completely used every last bit of that set and that's exactly what you do.

RUPAUL	This is the last shot. Hit me baby, one more time. Oh, she's toxic.

BOB	Yeah! Yeah!

DERRICK	Whoo. That was amazing. Did you guys have fun?

CYNTHIA	Whoo!

DERRICK	Oh, come on, boy Bob.

CHI CHI	The de-dragging process is the most exciting for me because I want to see what everybody looks like as a boy and [bleep], everybody's so cute.

BOB	Look at this butch [bleep] right here.

CHI CHI	This is my everyday look, hon.

THORGY	Layla out of drag, I want to sleep with. I like little shorties. Like, little husky shorties. Whoo.

CHI CHI	Oh, my God, that [bleep] Layla's ass is amazing. I can't help it. I'm such a top.

BOB	Betty, I still can't get over the gag of seeing you here.

ACID BETTY	I know, I mean, it is because some people think I'm dead.

DERRICK	Is that based on how you look or...

ACID BETTY	It's how I treat people, so watch yourself.

DERRICK	Oh.

BOB	Oh.

ROBBIE	A lot of the queens are turning into hens in a henhouse. They're like, "Oh, cluck, cluck." The competition as begun.

RUPAUL	Coming up, each of you will be assigned a legendary design challenge from a past season.

ACID BETTY	Yes, this is the competition I came here for.

NAOMI	Derrick Berry is not creative because he's impersonating someone else his whole life. He will definitely have the hardest time with this challenge.

DERRICK	(squeals)

RUPAUL	Ladies, over the past  episodes, I'm sure you've yelled at your TV, "Girl, I coulda slayed that challenge." Now it's your chance to prove it. For this week's maxi challenge, each of you will be assigned a legendary design challenge from a past season. It's your job to take the materials and make them your own. To assign the looks, I'll choose one of your names at random. In honor of the drag classic, "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," I've asked Morgan McMichaels to assume the position.

RUPAUL	All right, Morgan, let 'er rip.

RUPAUL	All right, the winner is... Robbie Turner.

RUPAUL	Now, Robbie, you get to assign all the queens' looks and choose your own. And now, it's time to bring back my girls. From season one, Shannel, presenting the Drag on a Dime thrift store challenge.

RUPAUL	Who gets Float Your Boat?

ROBBIE	Naomi.

RUPAUL	Who gets Money Ball?

ROBBIE	Acid Betty.

RUPAUL	Serving the Queen Who Mopped Christmas challenge from season three. Christmas came early, girls.

ROBBIE	Clearly, holy [bleep].

RUPAUL	Next, the bitch is back, and she brought Sharon Needles, presenting the Bitch Ball challenge from season four. Sit, Sharon.

RUPAUL	Okay, Robbie, who gets Gone With the Window?

ROBBIE	Bob the Drag Queen.

BOB	Yes.

RUPAUL	Who's gonna get a big Christmas package?

ROBBIE	Derrick Berry.

DERRICK	Yes.

RUPAUL	And Robbie, does this mean you're going to be doing it doggie style?

ROBBIE	Damn it. Can you believe I forget to pick a theme for myself? Guess who gets stuck with the poodle? (sighs)

RUPAUL	All right, ladies, well, you've got some serious designing to do. Now if I've said this once, I've said it  times. Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.

KIM CHI	Yeah!

BOB	All right!

KIM CHI	Oh, my God.

BOB	Let's do it.

CYNTHIA	All right, this is kind of interesting.

THORGY	I'm super excited about this challenge because I've watched every episode and I can kill any one of these challenges. Whoo, this is fun.

ROBBIE	Oh, these are [bleep] bags. (laughs) So I'm looking through my materials and I realize that a lot of these things can't be made into clothing. Dog chew toys, ropes. Huh. [bleep] my life. You guys, I brought treats. (laughs)

ACID BETTY	Dog treats.

ROBBIE	It's just a couple of treats, you know.

CHI CHI	Have you ever tasted one of those for real? They're actually good. You know, I'm from the South, we eat everything, honey. Possums, rats, raccoons.

ROBBIE	Possums? Speaking of, here's a beaver.

CHI CHI	(laughs) I don't eat beaver.

ROBBIE	Oh, too real.

BOB	Chi Chi's a [bleep] bumpkin. she's just country as [bleep] catfish sandwiches. She's like country.

NAOMI	So I get the pride float challenge and I got to drag this big ass boat for my very first impression.

LAYLA	How heavy is that?

NAOMI	Bitch, I don't even know if I can pick this up.

LAYLA	The skinniest, scrawniest girl. "Lift this down the runway."

NAOMI	I can hardly lift anything. How am I going to carry that on the runway and still walk as fierce as Naomi Campbell? It's like the thing that covers up the only thing I love about my body: my legs. [bleep]

BOB	Do brown and green--do they go together, like those two?

THORGY	In a challenge about wearing curtains on your body?

BOB	Yeah.

THORGY	Sure.

BOB	I got Gone With the Window and I'm excited because you get fabric. It's ugly fabric, but hey, girl, at least I got fabric.

THORGY	This is nice. Why don't you wear something like that?

BOB	Girl, I'm gonna look naked.

THORGY	You would disappear. You would disappear!

BOB	I'm gonna look butt naked, that's why.

THORGY	Where did Bob go, girl?

BOB	Where is she?

DERRICK	There's so much stuff to use. My theme for the challenge is The Queen Who Mopped Christmas. Oh, my God. (exhales) My strategy for this first challenge is to basically still come out with my Britney look. Like, I just want to add to it.

NAOMI	So what kind of vibe are you going for?

DERRICK	Like, this Christmas skirt. Like a tree skirt, but then I don't know how to finish a whole outfit. Girl.

NAOMI	Derrick Berry is not creative, obviously because he's impersonating someone else his whole life. He will definitely have the hardest time with this challenge.

DERRICK	And I'm like stuck on what to do for the top. (groans)

RUPAUL	Coming up...

CARSON	I believe they call that serving it.

ROSS	Hello.

RUPAUL	Nicole, would you wear this?

NICOLE	Um...


THORGY	The maxi challenge this week is to design a garment based on past challenges that other queens from other seasons have already done.

KIM CHI	My theme is the Hair Ball.

ACID BETTY	What are you doing?

KIM CHI	So, do you remember the Givenchy collection with like, the big fur?

ACID BETTY	Yes.

KIM CHI	It's inspired by that. I want to find a way to, like, celebrate this beige color.

ACID BETTY	Oh, God, how can you celebrate that?

KIM CHI	This material is going to be challenging to work with, especially because everything I have is a Florence Henderson shade of poop brown.

NAYSHA	There's so much stuff that I'm trying not to get overwhelmed and like, I got this and this and this and this and this. I don't do drag on a dime. I don't sew. I'm a pageant girl. I brought so many beautiful garments. I spend money. I don't want to get lost with all the stuff that I got. You know what I mean? There's a [bleep] piggy bank. A piggy bank. Am I supposed to mount this [bleep] on my head?

CHI CHI	Make it work, bitch. Make it work.

RUPAUL	Hello, hello, hello.

ALL	Hi.

RUPAUL	How's my dirty dozen?

RUPAUL	Bob the Drag Queen.

BOB	RuPaul.

RUPAUL	How did you get Bob the Drag Queen? How did that come about?

BOB	It's my dad's name. My dad's name is The Drag Queen.

RUPAUL	(laughs) It's a family name.

BOB	Yeah, Bob stands for big old bottom, what!

RUPAUL	Well, you know it does pay to advertise. Now, which one did you get?

BOB	I got Gone With the Window.


RUPAUL	Now do you know how to sew?

BOB	I'm not, like, the world's best sewer, but I know how to slap a garment together.

RUPAUL	So, you're not the world's greatest sewer. What are you the world's greatest?

BOB	I'm a stand-up comedian.

RUPAUL	Who's your competition?

BOB	You know, Ru, I don't want to sound so, uh, stereotypical.

RUPAUL	Do, do it, it's between us.

BOB	I don't--I don't have competition because no one here does what I do. I learned from listening to your podcast with you and Michelle, that there really is no reason to pretend to be modest. I'm [bleep] funny. I'm really funny.

RUPAUL	Let the world know.

BOB	First name, Bob, last name, The Drag Queen. Can she turn it? Yes, she can.

RUPAUL	(laughing)

BOB	It's true, girl.

RUPAUL	All right, I'm gonna let you get back to work.

BOB	Thank you, Ru. Thank you.

RUPAUL	All right. Acid Betty.

ACID BETTY	RuPaul.

RUPAUL	How you doing?

ACID BETTY	I'm gagging that you just said my name. I'm so honored to be here.

RUPAUL	Yes, now tell me about the Brooklyn drag scene.

ACID BETTY	Well, some of them are here. Thorgy Thor is here.

RUPAUL	Are you guys friends or are you friendly rivals?

ACID BETTY	We're definitely friends. We've never worked together. I actually haven't worked with a lot of queens in Brooklyn because I mostly work in Manhattan.

RUPAUL	Is that a read?

ACID BETTY	It could be.

RUPAUL	Describe for me what Brooklyn drag is.

ACID BETTY	Technically, I guess, Brooklyn drag right now is unpolished, um, hairy, so I try and elevate myself and have my beard.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh, all right. Now, what challenge did you get?

ACID BETTY	The Money Ball.

RUPAUL	Right, do you know how to sew?

ACID BETTY	I do, but this is, like, paper and glue.

RUPAUL	Now, I don't see any paper or glue yet.

ACID BETTY	So I'm trying to build a base first and then attach the paper, the money to it.

RUPAUL	Right. All right, I'm gonna let you get back to work.

ACID BETTY	Thank you, RuPaul.

RUPAUL	Layla McQueen.

LAYLA	What's going on, lady?

RUPAUL	Which challenge did you get?

LAYLA	I got the Rupocalypse.

RUPAUL	Rupocalypse! So what do you have planned?

LAYLA	Um, I was given, like, a few plastic hands and then like, a [bleep] ton of camouflage. I think camouflage is a disgusting component of human culture.

RUPAUL	Okay, yeah.

LAYLA	Um, I'd really like to play with the whole, like, deconstruction, like, jagged shapes and like... Um...

RUPAUL	Rough around the edges.

LAYLA	Yeah.

RUPAUL	Now tell me, how are you feeling? You seem a little shy.

LAYLA	I am and we started this day kind of... It was--it was all--it was a lot. But now, I'm, like, getting into the groove.

RUPAUL	Well, listen, you better get your [bleep] together because there's some very competitive girls here.

LAYLA	Oh, good.

RUPAUL	All right, Layla, I can't wait to see it. Thanks. All right, listen up, ladies. Tomorrow on the main stage, we'll decide how you measured up. Good luck and don't [bleep] it up. All right.

DERRICK	Oh, my God.

NAYSHA	Timing is not my friend right now.

NAOMI	Now I get why girls have emotional breakdowns.

DERRICK	Amen.

NAOMI	Everyone is freaking out because in the back of everyone's mind, while they're working on their outfits, is, " [bleep], I do not want to go home first."

RUPAUL	Coming up...

CHI CHI	(gasps) My [bleep] panties just ripped. I'm going into panic mode right now. This some bull [bleep].

BOB	I have no clue how she's gonna fix this outfit. I think she's done.

CHI CHI	 [bleep]

KIM CHI	Whoo, we're back.

DAX	Hello, couture.

NAOMI	This thing is too big. And that's not normally a complaint. Today is our very first runway and everyone is just trying to get their [bleep] done. So I'm not the only one stressing.

DAX	And I'm burning myself, and I'm burning myself, and I'm burning myself.

THORGY	Well stop burning yourself and shut up.

DERRICK	Did you have to change anything?

BOB	Nothing major, but I made this clutch, which I'm very proud of.

DERRICK	Oh, my God.

BOB	It is a known fact that a lady do carry a bag to dinner. This purse is hideous, but I'm using it.

KIM CHI	I think it goes with the look, though.

BOB	That was shade!

KIM CHI	No! I think it's cute.

BOB	Kim, you are shady.

KIM CHI	I'm not, I think it's cute.

BOB	Get away from me, Shade Chi.


NAYSHA	I actually do a lot of pageants, and I won this pageant. It's an international pageant. It's called Miss Continental and it is one of the most prestigious pageants.

CHI CHI	I've heard of it.

NAYSHA	Yeah, so I'm a former Miss Continental.

THORGY	That's awesome.

NAYSHA	Yeah.

CHI CHI	I hate pageants. Girl, I've done, like, two pageants.

NAYSHA	And you didn't win them and that's why you hate pageants.

CHI CHI	Exactly.

NAYSHA	I knew it. I knew it. That always happens to someone who don't win.

CHI CHI	Bitch, I was robbed. Like, to me, pageants are all about the who's who of drag.

NAYSHA	You know how many people who would tell me, "You're not gonna win the pageant. Why are you wasting your money? Why are you doing that?"

CHI CHI	Yeah, but you're gambling, you're gambling your money.

NAYSHA	Anything you do is a gamble, remember that. Are you really living if you're like, "Well, I'm not going to do it because I don't know the outcome." Really? This is the thing, you don't have to compromise who you are when you do stuff. You get what I'm saying? Be you. It just sucks that pageants get such a bad rap. I owe a whole lot of my work ethic and who I am to pageant experiences.

CHI CHI	You've given me a different outlook on pageants, but, girl, I still hate them.

NAYSHA	(laughs)

BOB	So, Derrick, how long have you been doing Britney?

DERRICK	I started on Halloween .

BOB	And how long you been doing drag?

DERRICK	Halloween . I've been doing Britney for  years, and I think a lot of other girls are not going to think I can do anything else, and maybe the judges even. I have to prove that I can do more than Britney.

BOB	I've found there's two breeds of queen. There's Halloween queens and there's pride queens. I was a pride queen.

DERRICK	Really?

BOB	I, like, started drag on Gay Pride wearing, like, [bleep] potato sack and a wig from, you know, who knows where.

LAYLA	Was that this Pride?

BOB	How dare you?

BOB	Oh you little bitch, how dare you.

ROBBIE	Oh, Layla!

BOB	It's all fun and jokes until someone gets sent home, girl.

LAYLA	Mm-mm. No, ma'am.

ROBBIE	How long have you been doing drag?

KIM CHI	I've been doing drag for two and a half years.

ROBBIE	Does your family support your drag?

KIM CHI	My family doesn't know that I do drag.

ROBBIE	They don't know?

ACID BETTY	Really?

KIM CHI	No.

ROBBIE	At all?

KIM CHI	Like, my mom thinks I'm a makeup artist.

ROBBIE	Has your mother ever seen you in drag ever, like pictures or anything?

KIM CHI	Well, I've shown her pictures of me in drag and she thinks they're, like, makeup jobs that I did. She doesn't recognize that it's me.

ACID BETTY	Stop.

ROBBIE	Really?

KIM CHI	Yeah. I guess I'm worried about my mom finding out that I did drag because growing up, I always felt like I could never be a model child that all Asian mothers want. I've already disappointed her so many times in her life. She could even stop talking to me. And... And you know, I'm just scared of letting her down again.

NAOMI	What foundation do you like to use?

CHI CHI	Girl, like, somebody gave me this. And they was just like, "This look like your color." So, I'm like, "Okay."

NAOMI	How long you been in drag?

CHI CHI	Five years.

BOB	And you're not brand loyal yet?

CHI CHI	No ma'am, I use whatever cost a dollar or free.

NAOMI	 want to be like the Anna Wintour of drag.

DERRICK	Wait, if you're the Nomi, then, uh,--who does that--am I the older one in "Showgirls"?

NAOMI	'm Naomi, not Nomi.

DERRICK	Oh, then that's perfect.

BOB	Come on, Naomi Shambles. Work the runway, girl. Naomi Shambles on the runway, girl. Knees clackin', clickity clackin, boom.

ACID BETTY	God, Bob and his mouth. He is like madness.

KIM CHI	I love it.

ACID BETTY	Do you really?

KIM CHI	He's like a talking head.

ACID BETTY	When I'm trying to concentrate, I really don't need, like, someone trying to, like, crack one-liners all the time. Especially when they're not always funny. Well, he's a comedian, which means I say  jokes, four of them are funny.

KIM CHI	I guess, like I'm just used to, like, getting ready with girls who's just like, loud and like, you know.

ACID BETTY	And see, I get ready alone.

BOB	Y'all know we ain't got no insurance, now sit down.

CHI CHI	(gasps)

BOB	What's the matter girl? Speak it out.

CHI CHI	I go to put on my outfit and what happens? Pop. My outfit has just ripped apart. Oh, God, I'm having a meltdown.

CHI CHI	Uh, that don't work. This some bull [bleep]. My [bleep] panties just ripped at the last second. And it's all coming apart.

THORGY	This fabric, for some reason, will not catch the bottom thread.

CHI CHI	This is some bull [bleep]. [bleep] I am going into panic mode right now. Girl, you cannot go home, not on the first day. I want this so freaking bad. Like, I'm so distraught, I don't even know what I'm doing now.

BOB	I have no clue how she's gonna fix this outfit. I think she's done. I hope you know the lip synch song, 'cause your outfit is crumbling before your hands.

CHI CHI	[bleep]


RUPAUL 	Cover girl, put the bass in your walk. Head to toe let your whole body talk. And what.


RUPAUL	Welcome to the main stage of "RuPaul's Drag Race." Michelle Visage, happy th.

MICHELLE	Happy birthday, gorgeous.

RUPAUL	Style superstar, Carson Kressley.

CARSON	You look amazing for .

RUPAUL	I know, I don't look a day over .

MICHELLE	Thank you Doctor Zizmor.

RUPAUL	Yes. And the straight talking, Ross Mathews. Now, on a scale from one to , how excited are you?

ROSS	Like, dragzillion.

RUPAUL	And the fabulous Nicole Richie. Hey, kitty girl.

NICOLE	Hi, gorge. Your dress is very "Wizard of Oz."

RUPAUL	Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

NICOLE	Or a sandwich.


RUPAUL	This week, our queens posed with Drag Race champions. And tonight, they're debuting their own creations based on a design challenge from the anals of "RuPaul's Drag Race." Michelle, did I say that right?

MICHELLE	Eh.

RUPAUL	Eh, close enough. Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win.


RUPAUL 	The realness.

RUPAUL	First up, Acid Betty, Money Ball. Well, bitch better have my money.

ACID BETTY	I do freaky drag, and I think I do it the best. The drag scene should not be homogenized and not everyone should look the same. Therefore, Acid Betty is here to represent.

NICOLE	Whoa, whoa, whoa, make it rain.

MICHELLE	Don't you love when you just find a dollar in your dress pocket?

RUPAUL	Yes.

MICHELLE	Didn't know this was here.

RUPAUL	Cash is queen, I own everything. Bob the Drag Queen, Gone with The Window.

CARSON	Yes, honey, lead with the bag. I love it.

BOB	This outfit shows that I have the ability to make a finished garment. The fabric is hideous, but the construction is everything. I'm living my dream with this ugly purse that I made.

RUPAUL	No shade, but that dress looks like it was made out of curtains.

NICOLE	It's very Butterfly McQueen.

MICHELLE	Frankly my dear, I don't give a dental damn.

RUPAUL	Dax ExclamationPoint, Hello Kitty.

CARSON	Hello, Herve Leger.

MICHELLE	Hello, Angeline.

RUPAUL	Meow.

DAX	This outfit is totally me. I love Hello Kitty. Anything a -year-old Asian girl wants, I want it more. I feel like a neon 's nightmare and I love it.

RUPAUL	I do love a pink [bleep].

NICOLE	It's better than a purple one.

CARSON	Why it got to be purple?

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez, Drag on a Dime.

MICHELLE	Fashion sure is changing.

NAYSHA	I am serving Greek goddess, giving you face for the gods. Face, body, glamour. And I am definitely serving that all right now.

MICHELLE	Peek-a-Ru, I see you.

RUPAUL	Uh-huh.

MICHELLE	A dress that makes cents. Not dollars.

RUPAUL	A dollar make me holler. Kim Chi, Hair Ball.

MICHELLE	(clears throat) (laughs)

ROSS	You got a little--someone's in a furry.

KIM CHI	I made a lion outfit inspired by Givenchy. I turned these ratty, dirty blonde wigs into a golden treasure. This outfit is big, grand, and conceptual. It's Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	She stepped that pussy up.

ROSS	Meow.

RUPAUL	Cynthia Lee Fontaine, Sugar Ball.

MICHELLE	Gumdrop it like it's hot.

CYNTHIA	I feel like a goddess of the snow. My "corselet" is just sickening. It's sugar, azúcar. Are you ready for my cuckoo? Yeah.

RUPAUL	Yes. Now see, that's the real sugar right there.

ROSS	She's serving cake.

MICHELLE	That's her sugar walls.

NICOLE	Whoa!

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls, Float Your Boat.

CARSON	Washington's cross-dressing the Delaware.

NICOLE	She has my dream chest.

CARSON	Yeah.

NAOMI	I'm trying to give you 's supermodel walk and this boat is covering half of it. When I can finally step out of this boat, that's when the judges can really see the true Naomi Smalls.

RUPAUL	Land ho.

NAOMI	I am giving you Naomi Campbell strutting down a Versace runway.

MICHELLE	Legzilla.

RUPAUL	Oh, oh that, yeah. That boat looks heavy. Are there any seamen to help her?

MICHELLE	Where are they?

RUPAUL	The seamen are all below deck. Chi Chi DeVayne, Glitter Ball.

CARSON	You know I always say, when life hands you disco balls...

NICOLE	Oh.

RUPAUL	What do you do?

MICHELLE	You make an outfit.

CARSON	Yeah.

CHI CHI	After my little meltdown, I'm just gonna roll with the punches and I'm really feeling this disco queen kind of vibe. It's a dream come true.

MICHELLE	That's a disco ball? I thought that was a fabulous globe.

RUPAUL	Yes.

MICHELLE	It's her ring.

CARSON	I thought it was a Judith Leiber bag. Cocktail bag.

RUPAUL	Balls to the walls. Thorgy Thor, Red Velvet Cake Couture.

MICHELLE	I'm hungry for that creamy middle.

NICOLE	This is feeling a little menstrual.

RUPAUL	I'm glad you said it and I didn't.

THORGY	I don't wear gowns, but for this challenge I just wanted to feel decadent and I still kept with my cartoon hair, giving you cream cheese realness.

RUPAUL	Oh!

MICHELLE	Happy birthday!

RUPAUL	Have her cake and serve it too. Robbie Turner, Bitch Ball. Who let the dogs out?

NICOLE	I love two bitches on a runway.

ROBBIE	I think I'm looking more like a sheep than a poodle. The dog is looking at me like, "Get me the [bleep] out of here." I'm looking at the dog like, "Get me the [bleep] out of here." This is not going well.

RUPAUL	Bow wow wow.

MICHELLE	Yippee yo, yippee yay.

ROSS	I give this look about a canine out of .

RUPAUL	Uh-huh, she's fade and she's throwing shade.

NICOLE	Those bitches are over it.

RUPAUL	Derrick Berry, The Queen Who Mopped Christmas.

CARSON	Well, hey, y'all.

DERRICK	I'm giving you Christmas in Vegas. I'm representing showgirls. I'm serving body. But I'm also giving comedy.

NICOLE	Whoa!


ROSS	Ho, ho, ho.

MICHELLE	She's trimming her bush.

RUPAUL	Is that mistletoe or camel toe?

NICOLE	I respect that.

CARSON	She's putting the X back in Xmas.

RUPAUL	Yes, she is.

MICHELLE	Oops, she's doing it again.

RUPAUL	Layla McQueen, Apocalyptic Couture. Now, her pussy's not on fire, but her shoulder is.

LAYLA	This look is classic Layla. I'm loving this cute little jacket I made. I'm giving you, like, a post-apocalyptic, like, devil commander, like, she's coming up, the world is over and I'm here to take over.

MICHELLE	The thigh's the limit.

RUPAUL	Layla McQueen, Beyond Thunderdome. Welcome, ladies. I feel like I just saw my whole life flash before my eyes.


RUPAUL	Now, ladies, when I call your name, please step forward. Bob the Drag Queen. Dax ExclamationPoint. Cynthia Lee Fontaine. Chi Chi DeVayne. Thorgy Thor. You are all... Safe.

CYNTHIA	Thank you.

RUPAUL	And for the th time, safe is not a word I associate with America's Next Drag Superstar. Now you may leave the stage. Time for the judges' critiques. Coming up...

MICHELLE	You're literally a blob.

ROSS	Don't stand on that stage and tell us it's the first dress you made.

RUPAUL	Do you think that you deserve to be in the bottom?


RUPAUL	Ladies, you represent the tops and the bottoms of the week. Now it's time for the judges' critiques. Acid Betty.

MICHELLE	I love that you're different. Every inch was kind of covered with a thought. To me, that's what drag is about.

CARSON	And then the photo, you seem like you're a little bit more of the avant-garde, artsy, like, you're giving me Tunnel . I was there.

ACID BETTY	I might've seen you there.

CARSON	You might've. Great job.

RUPAUL	Thank you, Acid Betty. Next up, Naysha Lopez.

NICOLE	You're gorgeous.

NAYSHA	Thank you.

NICOLE	You're giving me Eva Longoria, Miss America. Your makeup is stunning.

CARSON	I think, Naysha, you're beautiful, but when you're part of an ensemble photo, you really want to stand out. The dark hair and the dark top, I don't think it works in this picture.

MICHELLE	I have a pet peeve with seeing undergarments. So when you turn around I see illusion net. Give me the full illusion.

ROSS	That big gold piece just makes you look thick and I just don't think it looks good.

NAYSHA	This is actually the first garment I've ever made. I don't really sew. I felt like it was wearable and, you know, I got the challenge down.

RUPAUL	All right, well, thank you very much. Next up, Kim Chi.

KIM CHI	Hi.

CARSON	Your photo is pretty fabulous. And I really like your runway look. You are giving me, like, this Cowardly Lion anime ferociousness. I think it totally worked.

MICHELLE	The artistry on your face is just like geometric orgasm. I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and say the walk was a character choice.

KIM CHI	Every time I'm wearing something different, I'm living whatever fantasy of the outfit I've got going on. In my personal eyes, I'm an anime character who works as a high fashion model.

MICHELLE	You're just a total nerd.

KIM CHI	I am.

MICHELLE	I love that.

NICOLE	And by the way, I like that you kept your areolas bald. The breasts are the windows to the soul, for sure.


RUPAUL	Nicole, would you wear this?

NICOLE	I would definitely wear it.

RUPAUL	Where would you wear this?

NICOLE	Um, probably school drop off.

RUPAUL	Okay, yeah. Thank you, Kim Chi. Next up, Naomi Smalls.
NICOLE	I love that you are rocking a boy chest. You're giving me like, 's "Studio ."

RUPAUL	Michelle, how do you like her hair?

MICHELLE	Very pretty, only my hairline's not clockable.

RUPAUL	Okay, all right.

MICHELLE	The Pride Float was beautifully decorated, but it became really cumbersome. And I almost saw you thinking, "I have to get back in that boat and strap it on." And I'm saying that about the boat.

RUPAUL	Yeah, I know, how many times have you said that in your life?

MICHELLE	Girl.

RUPAUL	Yeah.

ROSS	But the picture. Hello?

CARSON	And it's a big butt.

ROSS	That is a big butt.

CARSON	I believe they call that serving it.

RUPAUL	Okay.

MICHELLE	That needs to come through with everything that you do, whether you're dragging a -pound boat with you or not.

RUPAUL	Next up, Robbie Turner.

ROSS	Your photo, I loved, because you're giving me kind of funny glamour there.

MICHELLE	You chose fur?

ROBBIE	It's like a fringe.

MICHELLE	Fringy kind of carpety-looking stuff. You're literally a blob. We lose all shape, and from the side, it's even worse.

RUPAUL	And you got to choose your challenge.

ROBBIE	I actually forgot that I--to choose one for myself. I didn't have my 's dress pattern, but I was trying to figure it out, like, at the last minute. So, it was like a series of misfortunate events.

RUPAUL	Do you think that you deserve to be in the bottom.

ROBBIE	Um, no, I think my personality is winning.

RUPAUL	All right, well, thank you very much, Robbie Turner. Next up, Derrick Berry.

MICHELLE	Your look tonight, it's adorable. I will say it's pretty simple.

CARSON	I like the comedic moment where you trimmed your holiday bush.

ROSS	I love a bush on the front door, but on the back door not so much.

MICHELLE	No. Definitely not berries.

CARSON	And then your photo, like, everyone in this photo looks like they're your backup dancers and you're the star.

DERRICK	Wow.

MICHELLE	We've seen Britney now. My personal challenge to you is to show me everything else but Britney.

DERRICK	Okay.

RUPAUL	We love your Britney. I do want to see more of it, but we do want to see other things.

MICHELLE	I want more!

DERRICK	And I'll give you more.

MICHELLE	You can't help yourself, can you?

RUPAUL	Up next, Layla McQueen.

NICOLE	Hi, Layla.

LAYLA	Hey, bitch.

NICOLE	I love the shoulder detail.

MICHELLE	Did you sew that?

LAYLA	I sewed the jacket, yes.

MICHELLE	That's pretty impressive.

LAYLA	Thank you.

MICHELLE	But I felt like the bottom half was just a cop out.

CARSON	This was a really fun category I think to like, do, like, totally, like, singe. To me, it's just like, Wynonna Judd opened the oven too quickly and got a little, like, you know, burnt on the outside.

MICHELLE	In the picture we lose you crumpling up into a ball. You're with all these kind of legendary people and it's almost like your body's saying "I'm not worthy."

RUPAUL	Do you think that your missteps would warrant you in the bottom?

LAYLA	I think I have a lot more to show and I don't think that I am... the least put together.

RUPAUL	Who do you think is the least put together?

LAYLA	I think Naomi. Her look is very plain.

RUPAUL	Do you agree with that, Naomi?

NAOMI	No. I tried to take something that was from a past season and make it new and fresh.

RUPAUL	Well, thank you, ladies. I think we've heard enough. While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.

RUPAUL	All right now, just between us squirrel friends, what do you think? Let's start with Acid Betty.

NICOLE	I love Acid Betty. she's a little bit dangerous, she's rock 'n' roll.

ROSS	In the photo she looks great, but she is this punk girl. Like, give me a little screaming... Ahh! Tongue out punkness.

CARSON	I don't hate her photo, and like her name implies, she's kind of a trip and she's a little East Village.

RUPAUL	Well, you know, I did a lot of antacid in the 's and I think that Acid Betty really represents that.

RUPAUL	All right, Naysha Lopez.

NICOLE	Her photo, unfortunately, I think she got lost.

ROSS	And also, don't stand on that stage and tell us it's the first dress you made.

RUPAUL	I mean, this is not the place you make your first dress.

MICHELLE	Girl.

RUPAUL	You make your first dress when you learn that you're gonna come on the show.

CARSON	Or you make them when your mom's at work and you're in the sixth grade.

RUPAUL	(laughs) All right, next up, Kim Chi.

MICHELLE	I love the photograph. She was kind of the queen of the castle in this anime jungle. Everything about her tonight made me happy, except for that lumbering walk.

RUPAUL	Right, because she was serving a little bit of Sasquatch on the runway.

ROSS	Sasquatch that walk.

MICHELLE	You can say Yeti that walk.

ROSS	Yeti that walk.

RUPAUL	Next up, Naomi Smalls.


NICOLE	I love that she looks like she might faint at any moment.

MICHELLE	All I saw was a really tiny thing lumbering with a heavy ass boat.

CARSON	I kind of like the contrast of her like, fumbling with the boat. It's like a cartoon of an ant carrying a giant piece of cheese.

RUPAUL	(chuckles) Yeah.

ROSS	Well, that's the picture of the day. It says, "bow down bitches."

MICHELLE	If she doesn't bring the photo her to this her, to me, she's gone.

RUPAUL	Moving on down to Robbie Turner.

CARSON	This look in her photo is probably her go to look. It's that Carole Lombard meets Carol Burnett. Superstar from the 's.

ROSS	But what we saw today was basic.

RUPAUL	Yes, she said she forgot to choose a category for herself.

CARSON	The dog ate my category.

RUPAUL	A dingo ate my category.

MICHELLE	Quite honestly, if she put any creativity into that, she could've turned it out and that's a shame because I like what I saw in the picture.

RUPAUL	Let's move on down to Derrick Berry.

NICOLE	Her Britney is amazing.

CARSON	You know he can nail the Britney thing. I mean, the photo was phenomenal.

MICHELLE	I'm glad she brought it the first episode. Now bring Derrick Berry to the table.

RUPAUL	But don't you want to see a little bit more Britney?

MICHELLE	Yes, we'll get more Britney.

RUPAUL	Layla McQueen.

MICHELLE	She did the most basic bottom half to that. I expect so much more.

NICOLE	This is season eight and the bar has been raised so high. There was just nothing standing out for me.

ROSS	The worst picture of the week, by far, but I find her interesting because she is an artist. That warrants a second chance to me.

RUPAUL	Silence. I've made my decision. Bring back my girls.

RUPAUL	Welcome back ladies. I've made some decisions.

RUPAUL	Acid Betty, you put your money where your mouth is and where your ass is and where your chest is.

RUPAUL	You're safe.

ACID BETTY	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Kim Chi, your photo and main stage presentation wigged us out. Congdragulations, you're the winner of this week's challenge.

KIM CHI	Oh, my God.

RUPAUL	You've won $, from selfieonastick.com. The original and the best selfie on a stick. Say hi, everybody. Cheese.

KIM CHI	I can be the Asian tourist that I've always wanted to be. Bitch, I just won $,. This win means I have a place in this competition and I am a force to be reckoned with.

RUPAUL	Derrick Berry, you're safe.

DERRICK	(whispers) Thank you.

RUPAUL	Naomi Smalls, you're safe.


RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez, you are gorgeous, but...

NAYSHA	Thank you.

RUPAUL	The judges felt shortchanged by your Drag on a Dime. I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.

NAYSHA	I am absolutely gagging. I don't deserve to be in the bottom two. You have some queen rocking this five dollar dress. I-I don't get it.

RUPAUL	Robbie Turner, your photo was iconic, but on the main stage, you screwed the pooch. Layla McQueen, you are an edgy artist, but your photo and your Post Apocalyptic Couture were not earth shattering. Robbie Turner... You're safe.

DRAG QUEEN	Oh.

DRAG QUEEN	All right.

DRAG QUEEN	Wow.

RUPAUL	Layla McQueen, I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.

LAYLA	My heart drops, but I'm not gonna be the first one to go home. I'm gonna do every kind of quasi-gimmick I have.

RUPAUL	Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination.

RUPAUL	The time has come...

RUPAUL	For you to lip synch for your life.

RUPAUL	Good luck, and don't [bleep] it up.

LADY GAGA 	I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong. To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?" If only fame had an IV, baby. I could bear being away from you. I found the vein, put it here. I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause-plause. Live for the applause-plause. Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me. The applause, applause, applause. Give me the thing that I love. I'll turn the lights out. Put your hands up, make them touch. Make it real loud.

CYNTHIA	Naysha is always giving like, beautiful, sexy, J.Lo boom shell, I feel it.

LADY GAGA 	Ooh. Touch, touch. Ooh. Touch, touch.

THORGY	Layla is giving you sex on a stick, and it's awesome. She is looking so good right now throwing her body all over the floor.

LADY GAGA 	I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause-plause. Live for the applause-plause.

KIM CHI	Naysha's dancing like a soccer mom. "You can get the ball in the goal, kids, you can do it."

LADY GAGA 	I live for the applause, applause, applause. Give me the thing that I love. I'll turn the lights out. Put your hands up, make them touch. I'll turn the lights out. Give me the thing that I love. I'll turn the lights out. Put your hands up, make them touch. Make it real loud. Make it real loud. Put your hands up, make them touch, touch. A-R-T-P-O-P.

LAYLA	Thank you.

RUPAUL	Naysha Lopez, out of  queens, you are by far one of the most beautiful to grace the stage.

NAYSHA	Thank you, Ru.

RUPAUL	And I'm sorry to see you go so soon.

NAYSHA	I'm sorry that I wasn't able to show you everything that I had to offer. Thank you, Ru, for this opportunity.

RUPAUL	Thank you. Now, sashay away.

NAYSHA	Now, good luck with all these monsters, Mary.

NAYSHA	I am first to go and I feel like I didn't let Ru see what I'm all about because there's so much more to me. Ru, I want to thank you for the platform that you have given me because not everyone appreciates it. I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart.

RUPAUL	Well, condragulations, ladies, and remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else? Can I get an amen in here.
