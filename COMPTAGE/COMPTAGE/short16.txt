THOMAS	Hello everyone! Today I learnt a very important lesson about... 

THOMAS	...Two wrongs not making a right. 

THOMAS	When some special visitors with cameras came to the Arelsdale Railway, Bert was pleased when they wanted to take pictures of him!

THOMAS	But when the visitors drove through some muddy water and splashed him, Burt got very cross. And he decided to get his own back.

THOMAS	They had splashed him, so Burt thought he would splash them back! 

THOMAS	When The Small Controller found out what Bert had done he wasn't happy. He sent Bert back to his shed. 

THOMAS	At the sheds the visitors told Bert they were very sorry they'd splashed him and that it had been an accident. They helped Bert get clean again.

THOMAS	Bert realised that by trying to get his own back on the visitors, he hadn't made things better, he'd only made things worse. 

THOMAS	So remember, two wrongs don't make a right!
