RUSLAN	But how cool is thatyou are dressed in armor, your sword in your hand, and over there in the distance you can see –

LESTOR	Yourself cleaning the stage…

RUSLAN	…a beautiful princess who needs to be rescued. Not… …yourself cleaning the stage... Oh, how I want to call it quits and  become a knight

LESTOR	Children of knights become knights, but you are an actor's son so, it’s not your choice, it’s just the way it is!

RUSLAN	Thank you for the reminder!

VLAD	Miiilllaaa!

MILA	enter…But how did you…I mean you were just…over…there 

MILA	Ahhh ha! A secret passage! I knew it!

VLAD	Mila, marriage is not something you should be afraid of.

VLAD	I will make sure your husband will protect you the way I do.

MILA	My point exactly!

MILA	This is what your protection is like: don't go here, it’s dangerous…

MILA	Don't go there, it’s dangerous…

VLAD	Oh-oh-oh!

MILA	Don't go anywhere because everywhere is dangerous; stay at home, Mila. All your life!

MILA	…while someone else sails the seven seas, climbs mountaintops and tames dragons.

MILA	See her?! That will be me soon!

VLAD	Ooogh! I will not permit you to look like this.

VLAD	But she is wearing too much lipstick and mascara!

VOICE	?-?-?!

MILA	Sorry!

MILA	But it’s not about make up…

MILA	And what made me think you would ever understand?!

VLAD	You are a Princess, Mila! It is   finally time you acted like one!

MILA	I know what that means: That means that a Princess should be boring, predictable, and well behaved.

MILA	…and above all, depressed?

VLAD	Deee…deeepr…deeedree-d-what?

VLAD	You drive me crazy with these big words! 

VLAD	Oh, how you’re just like your mother…

MILA	Oh, mother… Mother would understand me.

VLAD	Mila, I won’t be here forever.

VLAD	And if I go as unexpectedly as your mother did,

VLAD	I want to make sure that someone will look after you.

MILA	But I don’t want anyone to look after me, I can do that just fine. 

VLAD	(reactions)

MILA	I dream of big things happening for me!

MILA	Even if it’s a small adventure it will be better than this.

MILA	I want to feel alive in the world and not trapped in this stupid castle!

VLAD	You will get married anyway, 

VLAD	and if you don't choose a groom by tomorrow… I will choose one for you.

RUSLAN	…is not your choice!?

MILA	Exactly! Is not your choice!

VLAD	Answer me! Answer immediately!

RUSLAN	In the magic land!

CROWD	But it is just a fairy tale. Ha-ha. Chernomor. He went nuts. Yes, he became crazy. Maybe he was like that.

RATMIR	Maybe because he fell down and hit his head?

FARLAF	Yes, he is lying!

CROWD/RATMIR	Yes, he’s lying, surely lying. He is trying to hide something. And he is way too suspicious.

LESTOR	What do you mean “where”!? Right here. It was generated by my rich imagination.

RUSLAN	Tell me the truth!

LESTOR	What’s your problem anyway!? I am telling you, I made it all up.

RUSLAN	The problem is that Chernomor really does exist, and today he kidnapped the Princess.

LESTOR	What? You gotta be kidding!? 

LESTOR	Looks like you’re not kidding.

LESTOR	Alright then. But you have to promise that you won’t tell anyone…

RUSLAN	Lestor!

LESTOR	Alright! I had a bad case of writer's block once. Well… I just couldn't come up with anything, you know… It was a real torture…

RUSLAN	Lestor!

LESTOR	Basically, there was this book that I… borrowed …and in this book I read…

RUSLAN	Did this book say anything about where to find him, or, maybe, how to defeat him!?

LESTOR	No, nothing like that. But there was this hilarious story about a huge toad who, when kissed turns you into…

RUSLAN	Who did you steal the book from?

LESTOR	Borrowed.

LESTOR	Oh, I get it. Don't even think about it! The owner of the book is a scary and dangerous person, so you better stay away from him.

LESTOR	I am still trying to forget the way to his house…

RUSLAN	So you haven’t forgotten where he is?

LESTOR	No, I remember completely, like it was yesterday – agghhh! My tongue is my worst enemy. Why do you even care about this princess anyway!?

RUSLAN	I’ll tell you on the way. Are you with me!?

LESTOR	Do I even have a choice?

SUITORS	To the right! To the left. No, to the right. What do you understand! And I say! No, I say! No, to the right. Straight ahead. Surely straight ahead! Who do you think you are? I say - to the right and this is my word. So go to the right with your word. Only straight ahead!

THE CAT	Once every hundred years, during the Crimson Sunset, Chernomor kidnaps a princess who has fallen in love to replenish his magical powers with the power of her love.

RUSLAN	So, is Mila in love, too!?

THE CAT	All lovers are blind.

THE CAT	But to answer your question, all signs point to you being the object of her love.

RUSLAN	Are you sure!?

THE CAT	That's something you'd have to ask her yourself.

LESTOR	All lovers are b-li-nd. Oh, do I put an explanation after that!?

THE CAT	Anyway… Romeo, you only have two days* to rescue your beloved.

RUSLAN	Only two days? But where can I find her and how can I stop Chernomor?

THE CAT	Easy, troubadour, I don't know.

RUSLAN	But I thought you did!

THE CAT	Nope. But I know someone who does. Are you following!?

RUSLAN	Fin!?

THE CAT	But if you want to find him, you will have to travel to a strange land.

LESTOR	A strange land…
Oh my goodness, some strange land, not again!?

THE CAT	Not just some strange land, but a very magical one!

RUSLAN	I would journey to the end of the earth for Mila.

LESTOR	(reaction) 

THE CAT	Brave ladBut look, I’ve seen many brave men venture to Chernomor’s land, but not a single one returned

THE CAT	Still, if you’ve already made up your mind, here you go…

THE CAT	Let’s work, lazy bones. Here’s another brave fool who doesn’t know when to call it quits!

THE CAT	What are you looking at? Here are your new clients.

THE CAT	Aha, I almost forgot. When you get to the other side, it will be quite simple: just go straight ahead, 
THE CAT	and when you can’t go any further, use this.

RUSLAN	Thank you. I wish I could repay you some how…

THE CAT	Do not mention it. I, for one, think that this is a suicide mission… and also, about this…

THE CAT	…don't ever tell anyone about it!!

RUSLAN	I will be silent as the grave!

THE CAT	Oh boy, I am afraid that soon you will literally be as silent as the grave.

THE CAT	Now, do you need a special invitation!?

LESTOR	No… no… no… I’m coming.

THE CAT	Magic butt kick!

RUSLAN	Doesn’t look too difficult.

LESTOR	Well, I don't know, all I feel is danger.

RUSLAN	Have you noticed how dangerous they are? What a predatory grin!?

LESTOR	Ha?

RUSLAN	Let’s go; I’m sure that everything will turn out fine! Perhaps, you’ll be able to base your brilliant play on our adventures.

CHER	Marriage? No way! Ha-ha-ha!


MILA	Ha-ha-ha, oh, thank goodness then.

THE CAT	And I’ve only just finished cleaning up. Just a second. 

THE CAT	Okay. Let’s roll.

THE CAT	And now some down time.

LESTOR	So, here we are.

RUSLAN	It looks like there is nowhere to go, right?

LESTOR	It looks like we should have at least picked up some berries. I’m starving.

RUSLAN	Lestor, how can you be thinking about food at a time like this!?
LESTOR	That is it! I’m gonna go find something to eat, and you can stay here and figure out whether there is nowhere to go or somewhere to go…Oh, man! What we have got ourselves in to!

RUSLAN	So… There’s no way to the other side.

RUSLAN	Then we’ll have to use a gift, that Cat gave us.

RUSLAN	But how to use it?  Maybe, we just…

RUSLAN	E-eh… No. .

RUSLAN	Maybe it’s also magical, and we have to ask it? You know, very politely…

RUSLAN	Oh, the greatest… and the greenest...beanpod!

RUSLAN	Please, be so merciful… and show us, the lost travelers.., the way to the wise wizard!

RUSLAN	Oh the greatest… beanpod!

RUSLAN	We’re not greedy, but we need this pod not for food. Somehow, it should show us a way to wizard Fin. But how? That one we don’t know yet.

RUSLAN	What? You know it?

RUSLAN	Won’t you run away?

RUSLAN	What if we’re supposed to give it to the hamster?

RUSLAN	Here.

LESTOR	Wait! Stop! I do not trust this Hamster.

RUSLAN	Why?

LESTOR	Why? Did you see that bridge? What if its hungry relatives are hiding in this cave?

RUSLAN	If you’re so afraid – stay here

LESTOR	On the other hand, this hamster looks very sincere. 
Wait for me-e-e-e!!

CHER	That is too little. However, it will be sufficient to destroy a couple of measly human souls.

FIN	Ah, you want to bewitch me! But I won't listen to you. Blah-blah-blah!

RUSLAN	So what should we do with him?

LESTOR	Can we take him out with a stone? 

LESTOR	What! I am good at throwing stones…

FIN	I will bewitch you! Get loooost!

RUSLAN	I need to think…

RUSLAN	Oh I have an idea.

RUSLAN	We will start casting spells now! And if you don’t manage to do it first, we will bewitch you!

FIN	I will bewitch you right now! Death to all of you!

LESTOR	OK! We are starting the spell now!

RUSLAN	Abracadabra.

FIN	I will bring death upon you!

RUSLAN	Then you’d best do it faster because we have started casting our spell!

RUSLAN	Lestor!

LESTOR	Beh.

FIN	Has my power been restored!? I killed those poor people! (reactions)

FIN	Hey! He-e-ey! Are you completely dead?

FIN	Forgive me, stranger.

RUSLAN	Ha! No need to apologize.

FIN	Aaaaaaaaaaw!!! (shouts)

RUSLAN	Calm down! We won't hurt you! Fin! The Great Wizard!

FIN	Aaaaaaaaaaw!!! (shouts) 

RUSLAN	Dear Fin, we will leave you alone very soon! But the thing is, Chernomor...


FIN	Aaaaaaaaaaw!!! (shouts)

FIN	Blah-blah!

RUSLAN	Chernomor kidnapped the Princess, and I need to find out where he took her. Do you understand?

FIN	An actor, moreover, a second - or third-rate actor!

FIN	A courageous one, however. I once was courageous too, much more than you. But Chernomor! Chernomor took it all away from me. 

FIN	Chernomor’s power is in his beard, so if you cut it off…

RUSLAN	All his sorcery will disappear?

FIN	Possibly. Very likely. But nobody has ever managed to do that

RUSLAN	So where can I find Chernomor!?

FIN	His castle stands among the spiky rocks, you will not overcome Chernomor with a regular swordTo do that, you will need a special, magic sword.

LESTOR	And I was hoping this would be an easy deal…

FIN	But the sword is protected by a mighty hero. If I only had my courage again… Eh.

RUSLAN	Tell us how to find this sword!?

FIN	Walk three hundred steps east from the entrance of my cave. You will see a shaggy stone, then turn right.

FIN	and walk one hundred steps straight, then turn left and walk two hundred elbows straight. 

LESTOR	Whoa, slow down, I am trying to draw a map.

FIN	Three dozen raccoon leaps to the south. Five dozen moose steps till you reach a shaggy stone. 

LESTOR	Wait! The shaggy stone, again?

FIN	Six hundred steps with a lynx trot till you reach a dusk tree, then to the right and straight, straight and to the right again towards the hill on the edge of the steep,

FIN	and then you’ll see gloomy fields covered with thick fog. That is where the sword is hidden. And hurry up, the Crimson sunset is coming.

RUSLAN	Well…

FIN	And hurry up, the Crimson sunset is coming.

RUSLAN	Oh wow. So Lestor, did you draw a nice map?

LESTOR	…depends on what you call ‘nice’.

RUSLAN	This is more modern art than a map. I cannot understand a thing. 

RUSLAN	Do you know the way? Well, you are simply irreplaceable. So what are we waiting for!? Hamster!?

FIN	Hey… hey you… people… guys!!

RUSLAN	Hamster! What’s happened oooh!

LESTOR	Why are you all running so fast, especially on an empty stomach?!

LESTOR	Holy camoly!

LESTOR	You guys think that’s a friendly “nice to meet you” smile, or an “I’m going to eat you” smile!?

FIN	???????!

LESTOR	Definitely Number Two!

RUSLAN	R-u-u-u-u-n!

RUSLAN	Tss!

RUSLAN	Is this your legendary hero?

RUSLAN	Hello! Mister Hero, sir! We really need your help!

RUSLAN	Hey there!? Mister Hero?

RUSLAN	Do you have an idea how to wake him up?

LESTOR	Let’s fire his beard! 

RUSLAN	It’s a very foolish idea.

LESTOR	Well, everyone can criticize, than you propose something better

LESTOR	What’s the matter with him?

HEAD	A rat..!?

HEAD	Smells like a rat.

RUSLAN	A rat!? No-no-no, my name is Ruslan, and I...

MILA	(reactions till . )

CHER	(laugh)

CHER	So, you did make it here! Moreover, you have the sword! My, that's some longing for this hysterical woman…

RUSLAN	The sun is about to set. We have to make it through these spikes somehow… Lestor, you and the Hamster will go to the right, and I will go to the left, and whoever finds a passage first should whistle.

LESTOR	Okay, I’m coming…But… I don’t know how to whistle.

RUSLAN	Looks like the Hamster knows how to do that. You better hope he can’t write plays.

LESTOR	Very funny! Please tell me you can’t write plays…

RUSLAN	Una, go and find Mila. Let her know that I’m coming to rescue her.

RUSLAN	Mila!? Did you manage to escape!?  

RUSLAN	I came to your rescue, just as I promised.

MILA	You’ve come!? Why?

RUSLAN	What do you mean why!? To rescue you! This is me, Ruslan.

MILA	Ruslan…The poor clown and buffoon who lied to me about being a great knight, all to seduce me and sweep me off my feet. 

MILA	There's no mystery here: if you married the Princess, you would become the King. Why would any buffoon pass that up!?

RUSLAN	Mila, what are you saying? I don't recognize you!

MILA	What made you think you know me at all?

RUSLAN	But it seemed to me…

MILA	Well, you are right. It seemed to you. 

MILA	How could you think that I, the daughter of the great King, was really interested in a poor actor like you!?

MILA	Now you’ve shown up here to do what?

RUSLAN	To rescue you…

MILA	(laugh) Rescue me!? But do I want to be rescued?  

RUSLAN	I…

MILA	Here, I have everything that I need, everything that you would have never been able to give to me. 

MILA	A magnificent castle, riches, power, and even love!

RUSLAN	Love!?

MILA	Yes, love! Chernomor loves me, and we will get married today! And tomorrow we will go on a honeymoon trip around the world!

MILA	This is what I’ve dreamed of my entire life!

RUSLAN	But the crimson sunset…

MILA	Oh, please! It is just a fairy tale.

MILA	Ruslan, please understand! I don’t need you, I love Chernomor! 

MILA	…and if you have at least a little bit of honor left in you, you won't stand in the way of my happiness.

RUSLAN	No, I won't.

MILA	Good boy.

MILA	The poor clown and buffoon who lied to me about being a great knight,

MILA	I love Chernomor!
 
LESTOR	There is nothing here; maybe, on your side, there is a way.

LESTOR	Hmm, what’s wrong with him!?

LESTOR	 Ruslan!? Did you find a passage? Ruslan?

RUSLAN	You were right.	

LESTOR	Ha! Holy camoly, I know it! What am I right about?

MILA	(reaction) 

MILA	Hey, are you here? I know that you’re here. You know, I just met your groom  Ruslan, is it? Such a cutie! I felt so sorry for him when he found out that Mila…

CHER	…is not interested in him at all. Oh, how upset he was! My, oh my, I don't even know if he will ever recover from the heartbreak.

MILA	You are lying!

CHER	That's an insult, beauty. Look out the window and see for yourself. There is your hero, waddling home in disgrace.

LESTOR	Ruslan, it is not the end of the world.

LESTOR	But THAT, in fact, appears to be the case!

RUSLAN	But I - am - upset.

LESTOR	And this too shall pass. Now, go chop that cobble-stone into pieces.

RUSLAN	But how could she be so cruel and so cold!?

LESTOR	If you do nothing, the monster is the one who will be cruel, and us––why, we'll be very cold.

LESTOR	I… cannot… run… anymore.

RUSLAN	And I can't live without her.

RUSLAN	The pendant!? Where did you get it?


RUSLAN	No, she wasn't wearing it… oh!

RUSLAN	Well, deceitful Chernomor, this will be your last act.

LESTOR	This is it… I just can't… go on.

RUSLAN	Hands off my friends!

RUSLAN	Ha, I think I know how to get to the castle.

RUSLAN	Lestor, it was a lie. The Mila that I saw was not real. She was not wearing this.

RUSLAN	She said she would never take it off, so it couldn’t have been her who drove me away, and perhaps she is still waiting for me,

RUSLAN	or perhaps even loves me

RUSLAN	Aren't you glad?

LESTOR	I am glad… I am very glad… Can’t you see me clapping?

RUSLAN	There’s no time to be laying around. Let’s go, we need to rescue Mila, the sun is about to set.
