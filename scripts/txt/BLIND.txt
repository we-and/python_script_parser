DANNY	There’s no doubt that, when I was a kid, I was what you would call…

DANNY	different.

DANNY	Yes, that’s me, Danny Valdessecchi,…

DANNY	followed by my loving family.

DANNY	They were always trying to help… 

DANNY	…always trying to save me from myself.

LUCIA	Are you okay?

GIRL IN PARK #1	He’s not moving!

LUCIA	Talk to me.  Are you alright?

YOUNG LARRY	He looks like roadkill.

YOUNG DANNY	I’m okay.

YOUNG LARRY	Way to go, asshole!

LUCIA	Lorenzo!

DANNY	My mom was the kind of person whose love could kill you if you weren’t careful.

DANNY	I guess she blames herself because I was born 3 months premature…

DANNY	But I was just in a hurry to get out.

DANNY	I’m always in a hurry.

MRS. LUCIANNO	Hi, Danny.

ANGELO	Pull!  Pull!


YOUNG LARRY	Dad, can I hit?

ANGELO	It’s Danny’s turn.

ANGELO	Alright, I’m gonna pull this thing out of the ball, it’s gonna make that noise.

ANGELO	When you hear it, whack it. Swing!

YOUNG LARRY	You suck!

YOUNG DANNY	I can do it!

DANNY	My dad was cool.  He never worried like my mom.

DANNY	He knew I didn’t want to go to blind school, so he sent me to normal school.  

DANNY	And he let me and my brother visit him at work.


YOUNG LARRY	Help!  A blind kid’s driving the train!

DANNY	Larry, my brother:…

DANNY	only 2 years older than me, was a boy with a mission.

DANNY	He took it upon himself at an early age to teach me about life.
YOUNG LARRY	C’mon, Danny, you’re gonna love them.

YOUNG MARIE	Don’t do it! Remember the last time?

YOUNG LARRY	You keep outta this.  This candy’s not for little girls.

YOUNG LARRY	This candy’s only for men.

YOUNG LARRY	C’mon, take a piece!

YOUNG LARRY	It’s dog shit again!

DANNY	And as we grew up, Larry’s life lessons continued.

YOUNG DANNY	Larry, what’s happening?

YOUNG DANNY	Is she dying?

DUMBASS FRIEND #1	It’s your mom!

LUCIA	Lorenzo!  

LUCIA	And in front of Danny?!

YOUNG LARRY	What’s the problem?  He can’t see nothin’!

LUCIA	God can see!!!

DANNY	Needless to say that by the time I was a young man, I needed help.

DR. EVANS	Try to be more specific, Danny.   

DR. EVANS	Why do you think you feel this way?

DANNY	I guess I’m just curious.   

DANNY	I run my fingers over my face,…

DANNY	but that tells me shit about how I look.

DR. EVANS	And that matters to you?

DANNY	Of course it does.

DANNY	Even Marie’s got these friends and they come by, and she’s 14 years old.

DANNY	These girls freak me out.  

DANNY	I wanna know that girls are attracted to me…

DANNY	and don’t just feel sorry for me, aren’t giving me pity. 

DANNY	I feel like I’m a 12-year-old trapped in a 22-year-old body.

DANNY	I’m a 22-year-old blind virgin who doesn’t know a thing about girls.  

DANNY	I at least want to know that I don’t look like some kind of monster. 

DR. EVANS	Believe me, Danny, you don’t look like a monster.

DANNY	Doc, are you naked again?

DR. EVANS	I’m sorry, Danny, I…

DANNY	You promised you weren’t gonna do that anymore.

DR. EVANS	It’s just a little problem.  I’m working on it, though.

DANNY	You’re one of the smartest people I know, but you might be crazier than your patients. 

DR. EVANS	It’s just sometimes I feel this need to break out, to be who I really am.

DR. EVANS	I’m sorry. It will never happen again. I promise.

DANNY	You said that last time.

DR. EVANS	I know.  And I’ll probably say it again.

DANNY	You’re a kook. But I love you.

DR. EVANS	So, where were we?

DANNY	So apart from the fact that I got this problem with women,…

DANNY	I’m handling things pretty well.

TEENAGE GIRLS #1 & #2	Hiya, Danny.

TEENAGE GIRL #1	He’s so cute.

LUCIA	Come on in.  Your father wants to talk to you.

ANGELO	Don’t you wanna sit down?

DANNY	No.  What’s up?

MARIE	I say go for it!

DANNY	Go for what?

LUCIA	It’s too dangerous!

LUCIA	How could you do this to me?!

DANNY	How could I do what to you?  What’re you talking about?

MARIE	But it’s Danny‘s big chance!

LUCIA	It’s outta the question.

LARRY	Somebody wanna fill me in on what we’re talking about?

MARIE	You stay out of it! Ma, let me talk!

ANGELO	Alright!  All of you, shut up!

ANGELO	Danny, we got a call from a Doctor… what was his name?

LUCIA	Perkins.

ANGELO	That wasn’t it.

LUCIA	You talked to him. You said…

ANGELO	No. It was something else.

DANNY	It’s Perkins.

ANGELO	A Doctor Perkins.

ANGELO	He said you may volunteer for some sort of experimental operation,…

ANGELO	maybe can make you see?  How come you never said nothin’?

DANNY	Because I haven’t volunteered for anything yet.

LARRY	You don’t talk to me about these things?

DANNY	It’s not a big deal.

LARRY	What’s goin’ on?

LUCIA	It’s not gonna happen.  There are risks.   

LARRY	You wanna let him make up his mind for once in his life?

MARIE	Ma, what if he could see?

LARRY	Exactly!  

LUCIA	You are a Guinea, not a guinea pig.

ANGELO	Come back here!  We’re not through talkin’!

DANNY	This is why I didn’t say anything!
 
DANNY	I didn’t wanna worry you, Ma.  I didn’t wanna get everybody’s hopes up, either.

DANNY	I don’t even know if I wanna go through with this yet.

ANGELO	Danny… It’s your call.  

ANGELO	Whatever you decide to do, we’re behind you.

DANNY	I know.

ANGELO	Right?

DANNY	Well, I’m hungry.  Ma, how ‘bout some dinner?

BOGART	Where I’m goin’ you can’t follow.  What I’ve got to do, you can’t be any part of.

BOGART	Hilda, I’m no good at being noble, but it doesn’t take much to see…

BOGART	that the problems of 3  little people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

BOGART	Here’s looking at you, kid.

DANNY	Jay, what’s up?

JAY	I got some ballers down at the court who will swear they got game.

JAY	You wanna make some bucks?

DANNY	Let’s do it.

JAY	Are you nuts?!  What are you doing?

JAY	I’m convinced!  You are the “Bat Man”.

JAY	How’s your sonar?

DANNY	Good. Let’s do it.

DANNY	For money?
JAY	Hey!  This is the guy I was telling you about.

JAY	Like I said, if he wins, you gotta pay 5-to-1.  It’s only fair.

BASKETBALL GUY #2	How’s he gonna know where the hoop is?

JAY	What are you, the handicap police?

JAY	Take a shot.  Show ‘em.

BASKETBALL GUY #1	Bring it, and let’s try $10.

JAY	$10?

BASKETBALL GUY #2	That’s $50 if he wins.

BASKETBALL GUY #1	He’s blind as a bat.  We got this.

JAY	Ready?

JAY	Let me see the ball.

JAY	Stevie Wonder’s gotta shoot first.

JAY	Follow the voice.

JAY	Danny, follow the voice.  

JAY	Goodness!  3 times in a row!   That was net. It’s still good.

JAY	You guys got a “H”.

JAY	Oh, you got an “O”!

JAY	You got an “R”!

JAY	You guys got an “S”!  

JAY	That was net, wasn’t it?  

JAY	 “E”!  You guys lose!  Pay up!

JAY	Now we’re talkin’.

DANNY	What is it?

JAY	$50!

JAY	You are amazing.   The way this is going, you’re gonna have most of my tuition paid.

DANNY	Just think of it as a basketball scholarship.

JAY	How ‘bout you?  What’s going on with that night law school?

DANNY	I got my first class comin’ up.

JAY	You ready?

DANNY	Of course I am!

MARIE	Gina said if you ask her out, she’ll say yes.

DANNY	I don’t think so.

MARIE	How come you never wanna go out with my friends?

DANNY	Because they’re 14, Marie.

LUCIA	What could these girls offer him?

LARRY	The time of his life, Ma.  That’s what they could offer him.

LUCIA	Not everyone is like you, Lorenzo!

LARRY	That’s what you think.

LUCIA	At least now you’re in your own apartment; you don’t bring ‘em here anymore.

DANNY	Thank God.

JAY	See, this is why I love comin’ over here.

LARRY	Danny, remember that girl, ass like a coconut?

LUCIA	My God…!

LARRY	She’s layin’ in the tub, he has no idea…

LARRY	…he turns on the water,…

LARRY	…she almost has a heart attack…

ANGELO	We’re eatin’ here! 

LARRY	You’re right.  I’m sorry.  Marie, forgive me.

ANGELO	So, Danny, when are you gonna tell us about the operation?

DANNY	Let me volunteer first.  What’s the hurry?

LUCIA	The doctor said family’s important.

LARRY	Yeah, it’s important to stay out of it.

LUCIA	To give support!

ANGELO	Maybe tomorrow we can drive you there.

DANNY	It’s alright.  Jay’s giving me a ride.

LARRY	Jay’s got wheels now?

JAY	Let go of my ears!

JAY	Danny, what are you doing?! 

JAY	Made it!

DANNY	Nice wheels.

JAY	Chicks dig it.

JAY	You gonna be alright to make it home?

JAY	Alright, buddy, have a good one.

WOMAN #1	No name-calling. You promised you’d be good.

WOMAN #1	You told your mom you were gonna behave while she was gone.

LEEZA	Are you okay?

DANNY	I’m fine.

DANNY	Where’s Doris?

DANNY	Where’s Doris?!

LEEZA	Can’t you see I’m busy?!

DANNY	No.  Can’t you see that I’m fuckin’ blind?!

TODDLER 1	He said the “B” word.

DANNY	What happened to Doris?

LEEZA	She’s on vacation.

DANNY	It’s too bad.  I liked her.

DANNY	What are you staring at?

DR. PERKINS	The signal from the camera, which is mounted on the glasses,…

DR. PERKINS	goes directly to a chip…

DR. PERKINS	which is implanted in the visual cortex in the brain.

DANNY	So my eyes are not a part of the process then. 

DR. PERKINS	The camera bypasses them.  Remember:…

DR. PERKINS	we don’t see with our eyes; we see with our brains.

DR. PERKINS	I’d like to tell you that, if the operation is successful,…

DR. PERKINS	you would be able to see like everyone else.

DR. PERKINS	That’s not going to happen. 

DR. PERKINS	The best you could hope for is a fuzzy black and white image.  

DR. PERKINS	Maybe it’ll be good enough to keep from bumping into things,…

DR. PERKINS	maybe it’ll be enough to see a face.

DR. PERKINS	Oh, thank you.  Yes.  Please.

DR. PERKINS	It’s Dr. Evans.  I’ve asked her to join us.  

DR. PERKINS	She’s going to be a vital member of the team.

DR. PERKINS	Dr. Evans.

DR. EVANS	Dr. Perkins

DANNY	Amarige.

DR. EVANS	Oh.  Yes, Danny, that’s right.  

DR. EVANS	That’s my new scent. Do you like it?

DANNY	Yeah, it suits you.

DANNY	What do you think, Doc?

DR. PERKINS	Smells good.

DR. PERKINS	Dr. Evans will be responsible for putting together the psychological reports…

DR. EVANS	of all the potential candidates for this operation.

DANNY	I got no problem with that.

DR. PERKINS	So then all we really need to know –…

DR. PERKINS	if the FDA gives us the green light – …

DR. PERKINS	can we put you down as a potential candidate?  

DR. EVANS	You can take your time.

DR. EVANS	This is a very important decision.

DR. PERKINS	Do you have someone meeting you?

DANNY	No.  I’ll get a cab if you can point me in the right direction.

DR. PERKINS	You know how to get out of the building?

DANNY	I memorized that.

DR. PERKINS	You hang to the left, go about 15 paces.   

DR. PERKINS	You should reach the street and a cab should be waiting there.

LEEZA	I can take him, Dr. Perkins. I’m leaving now.

DANNY	I think I can manage, Doris.

LEEZA	The name’s Leeza.

LEEZA	Why doesn’t he use his cane?

DR. EVANS	Because he doesn’t think of himself as blind.

DANNY	Goodnight, Doris.

LEEZA	Goodnight, Danny.

DANNY	Taxi!

MRS. RAJA	Leeza!  You’re late! They’re waiting for you!

LEEZA	Arvind’s here.

MRS. RAJA	And Mr. Bhat.

LEEZA	I’m sorry.  I forgot.

MRS. RAJA	I don’t think you should say that to your future husband.

RAVI	You’re in big trouble.

LEEZA	Take a hike, Ravi.  

LEEZA	Or I’ll tell them what I found under your bed.

LEEZA	I’m sorry I’m late.

LEEZA	I apologize for keeping you waiting…
BHAT	Why does she not speak Hindi?

LEEZA	Why?  Do you not speak English?

BHAT	Of course I speak English.

BHAT	I see your daughter does not follow our traditions…

BHAT	of respect for elders and punctuality.

ARVIND	Sorry.

MR. RAJA	For my daughter, punctuality is an aspiration…

LEEZA	Dad!

MR. RAJA	…and respect has to be earned.

STUDENT	Watch it!  It’s my computer!

DANNY	I’m sorry. I didn’t see it.

STUDENT	Well, pick it up and give it to me.

DANNY	Relax, I’m looking for it.

STUDENT	Just give it back.

GUY IN CLASS	He’s blind.

LARRY	So they know you’re blind.  They were gonna find out sooner or later.

DANNY	It’s none of their business.  

DANNY	Besides, he was rude.  I should’ve smacked his face.

LARRY	You didn’t tell me he was rude to you.

LARRY	You want me to turn around?  I’ll go beat the shit out of him.

DANNY	Maybe later.

DANNY	Is there someone in the back?

LARRY	Yeah.  Suzie.

DANNY	Who’s Suzie?

LARRY	Suzie’s a hooker.

DANNY	And she’s in the back with someone?

LARRY	Yes.

DANNY	What’s going on?!

LARRY	When I haven’t got a booking, I’ve been renting out the car to my lady friends.  

LARRY	They take care of the business in the back with their johns.

LARRY	Now the johns have to pay an extra $50,…

LARRY	‘cause that’s classified as kinky sex.  

LARRY	That extra $50 goes to the house:  Yours truly.

LARRY	You wanna get somethin’ to eat?  This soundtrack’s makin’ me hungry.

LARRY	So, are you gonna go through with this surgery?

DANNY	I don’t know.

LARRY	What do you got to lose?

DANNY	Half my brain.

LARRY	What do you mean?

DANNY	They have to implant this chip in my brain.

LARRY	This is like brain surgery?!

DANNY	Yes, genius, like brain surgery.

LARRY	Here, you’re a slob.

DANNY	What are you doing? 

LARRY	You’re makin’ a mess.

LARRY	Filthy!

DANNY	Touch your face. 

LARRY	So this might have a significant “Oops” factor.

DANNY	What?

LARRY	“Oops, we lost half your childhood memories.  Sorry.”

DANNY	Exactly.

LARRY	And what’s the upside? 

DANNY	They said if it works – and it’s the mother of all “ifs” –

DANNY	they can get a fuzzy black and white image.

LARRY	We don’t want anything less than full-blown, high-definition color.

LARRY	Ya know? Digital.

SUZIE	This gentleman has a favor to ask you.

SUZIE’S CLIENT	Photo.  

SUZIE	Yeah, photo.

LARRY	You want me to take a picture? Sure.

LARRY	Here we go.  Ready?

SUZIE	Don’t press the boobs, sweetie.

LARRY	One, two, three.

LARRY	Thank you.

SUZIE’S CLIENT	Arigato!

LARRY	Arrigatori.  

SUZIE	Thank you.

LARRY	Thank you, sweetheart.  

SUZIE	Who is your friend?

LARRY	This is my brother Danny.

SUZIE	Get out of town!

LARRY	That’s him.

SUZIE	Have you told your brother how handsome he is?

LARRY	I haven’t today.

SUZIE	Well, tell him.

LARRY	Danny, you’re gorgeous.

SUZIE	Well, you are.  

DANNY	Thank you. 

SUZIE	Hey, Danny,…

SUZIE	any time you wanna go in the back of your brother’s limo with me… 

SUZIE	you just let me know.  

SUZIE	No charge, of course.

DANNY	Will do.

SUZIE	Okay, you boys.  

LARRY	Alright, you little sex kitten.

SUZIE	You all have a great night.

LARRY	I’ll see you tomorrow.

SUZIE	I’ll see you tomorrow, hot stuff.

LARRY	Damn right.  

LARRY	That’s my kind of woman.   

LARRY	She just made you an offer you can’t refuse.

DANNY	Stop it!

LARRY	Danny, don’t bullshit me.  We both know you haven’t done it.  

LARRY	At your age, it’s not natural.

LARRY	You could start to build up all kinds of pressure.

LARRY	And let’s not forget about your prostate.  

LARRY	This is why old guys have all those problems.  No sex!

DANNY	You think the fact I haven’t had a relationship hasn’t been on my mind?

LARRY	I’m not talkin’ about a relationship, I’m talkin’ about sex!

LARRY	You do wanna do it with a woman, right?

DANNY	Of course I do!

LARRY	I just had to ask.

LARRY	You gave me a heart stopper there for a second.

DANNY	I don’t want something cheap.  I’m looking for the real thing.

LARRY	Fine. I’ll set you up with one nice girl.

DANNY	I don’t want a hooker.

LARRY	Okay.  I’ll find a good girl for you!

DANNY	I don’t think so.  We’ve been through this before.

LARRY	You know what I think?  I think you’re scared.

DANNY	Bullshit!

LARRY	Are you afraid of a little vagina?

DANNY	Shut your mouth!

LARRY	Scared of the vagina.

DANNY	It’s gotta be a real date, dinner and everything.

LARRY	And then take her back to my place.

DANNY	If we feel something for each other, and she wants to do it, we’ll do it.   

DANNY	Only if she wants to.

LARRY	That’s how it usually works. Otherwise they arrest you and charge you with rape.

LARRY	What are you laughing at?

DANNY	I’m just thinkin’, it’d be like a real ‘blind date’.

LARRY	After 22 years, you just thought of that joke?

DANNY	You’re still wearing that cologne?

LARRY	You don’t like that?

DANNY	It’s patchouli.

LARRY	You really don’t like that?

MARIE	So who is she?

DANNY	Mandy ‘someone’.

MARIE	And you trust Larry?  What if she’s a dog?  

MARIE	Okay.  Stand up.  

MARIE	You look good. I like the hair.

LARRY	Oh, what is this now?
DANNY	How do I look?

LARRY	Like a jackass, Danny!

MARIE	He looks good!

LARRY	Did you do this?

MARIE	Yeah.

DANNY	What?!

LARRY	We gotta change that shirt.

DANNY	What’s wrong with the shirt?

MARIE	Nothing. It has color.

LARRY	A lot is wrong with that shirt!

MARIE	We don’t need another Tony Soprano in our house.

LARRY	Do not say anything bad about Tony Soprano.

MARIE	Larry, you can leave now.

DANNY	Guys…the shirt!  What’s wrong?!

LARRY	Out!

MARIE	I was just trying to help.

DANNY	Larry? What’s wrong with it?

LARRY	It’s very loud.

DANNY	Okay.  Pick another one.

LARRY	This is a nice shirt. I bought you this shirt.

DANNY	Come on!  

DANNY	So how do you know her?

LARRY	She’s a friend of a friend.

LARRY	What? I’m not done yet!

DANNY	You make a blood oath that she isn’t a dog, or I stay.

LARRY	Are you kidding me?

LARRY	You don’t trust me anymore?

DANNY	In one word, “no”.

LARRY	Why not?

DANNY	Are you forgetting Graziella Morino in the 10th grade?

LARRY	“Gorilla Morino”?

LARRY	Some people thought she was hot.

DANNY	She smelled like a shaggy carpet!
DANNY	You make the oath or I stay.

LARRY	Fine! 

DANNY	Cut!

LARRY	God, that hurts!

DANNY	Sharp edge, Larry.

LARRY	No…  A blood oath is when we both cut ourselves.

LARRY	That’s what it is.

LARRY	You cut yourself.

DANNY	Do it.

LARRY	Are you gonna do it?

LARRY	Then let’s get outta here.  C’mon.

LARRY	Mandy, it’s my pleasure to introduce you to my brother Danny.

DANNY	Very nice to meet you.

DANNY	After you.

MANDY	Oh, you poor man!

MANDY	I‘m so sorry.

DANNY	No…  I’m sure you’ll feel better after we get some food.  

MANDY	So you’re really blind?

DANNY	Look.  Please, stop crying.  Stop it!

DANNY	I’ve been like this since I was born.  I don’t know any differently.

MANDY	How brave!

DANNY	Why don’t we talk about you?  Tell me something about yourself.

MANDY	There’s not much to tell, really.   

MANDY	I’m 25 years old and I work as a secretary.

MANDY	People think I look like Meryl Streep.  

MANDY	But you’ll never know what Meryl Streep looks like.

DANNY	I think the next one shouldn’t be so sensitive.

JAY	Evening.

HEIDI	Get out of my way, asshole!  Can’t you see he’s blind?!

HEIDI	Look what you did!

HEIDI	Danny, come here, honey.  Let me help you.  

DANNY	Put me down. 

DANNY	I can walk.

HEIDI	Just tryin’ to help.

HEIDI	You gonna get the door or what, Tupac?  Let’s go!

JAY	There you go.

HEIDI	Ladies first.

HEIDI	I’m sorry.

DANNY	I’m fine.  Really.

HEIDI	Cheers, baby.

HEIDI	So, tell me, are you a physical guy?

HEIDI	You like to work out?

DANNY	Sure.

HEIDI	What do you press?

DANNY	50 pounds, maybe.

HEIDI	I like a man with a sense of humor.

HEIDI	Mama’s gonna help you out.

DANNY	You know, I can eat on my own.  It’s fine.

HEIDI	I’m just tryin’ to create some chemistry, baby.

DANNY	I gotta go to the bathroom.

HEIDI	I’ll take you!

DANNY	I can walk.

HEIDI	Mama hasn’t had action like this in weeks!  I’m hungry.  Let’s go.

HEIDI	Danny boy! Mama’s here!

DANNY	Pick up…! You better get your ass in here!  She’s crazy!

HEIDI	Open this door!

PIETRO	Senora!  I must ask you to leave!

DANNY	Hurry!

HEIDI	Don’t “Senora” me, Pablo!

HEIDI	You better hold on to your squirrel before he loses his nuts.

PIETRO	Take your time.  Can I get you something to drink?  An espresso perhaps?

DANNY	Just get in here. Oh God!  Get in here!

HEIDI	Have you ever done it in the bathroom?

DANNY	I just wanna meet a normal woman!

HEIDI	I’m gonna get you, honey!!!  You do not cross Big Mama!!!

EMMA	I’ve been looking so forward to this night,…
EMMA	that I brought a little something with me as a surprise.

EMMA	Danny, I wanna feel the way you feel.  

EMMA	I wanna see the things you see. 

EMMA	I wanna be as one with you.

EMMA	Look.  I have a blindfold.  I can see the blackness…

DANNY	Doris still on vacation?

LEEZA	You’re good at this, aren’t you?

DANNY	I’ve got great insight.

LEEZA	I’ll tell him you’re here.

DR. EVANS	This is a very big decision. Are you sure you want to do it?

DANNY	Sure I am.

DR. PERKINS	It’s very brave of you.

DANNY	It’s not like I’m volunteering for a suicide mission, is it?

DR. PERKINS	No…  

DR. PERKINS	What I meant to say was neuro-surgery is never without risks.

DR. PERKINS	It would be wrong of me to say otherwise.

DANNY	Then what are the risks?

DR. PERKINS	We really don’t know.

DR. PERKINS	Help!

DR. EVANS	I think what Dr. Perkins is trying to say is that…

DR. EVANS	you are very courageous to try something that has not been done…

DR. EVANS	…very often.

LEEZA	I can take Mr. Valdessecchi to a cab, Doctor…if he wants.

DANNY	They told me there’s always risks with brain surgery, but I figure, what the hell?  

DANNY	You gotta be brave sometime. 

LEEZA	Sure. But it’s not so smart to walk around without a cane. Step!

DANNY	Thanks, Mom.

LEEZA	You’re welcome.

LEEZA	You’re in luck.  Here’s a cab.

DANNY	I got a confession to make.  I don’t really need a cab.  

DANNY	I just wanted to talk with you a while. 
 
LEEZA	That’s very sweet.

DANNY	My brother Larry’s coming to pick me up.  He runs a limo service.
DANNY	Larry’s Limos.

DANNY	He’s not here yet.

LEEZA	How can you tell?

DANNY	If he were here, you’d know it.  But, when he comes, maybe we can give you a ride.  

LEEZA	Thanks, but I’d better not.  And my bus is here, so I better go.

DANNY	Okay.

DANNY	See you soon.

LEEZA	Thanks, Mom.

LEEZA	If she brings us any more food, we can open our own restaurant.

ARVIND	We don’t have to.  After we get married, we’ll take over this one. It’s been discussed.

LEEZA	And what else has been discussed?

ARVIND	That you’ll run this place until we start having kids.

LEEZA	Have you discussed when that is gonna be?

ARVIND	Well, the sooner the better.  

ARVIND	And I say we start practicing now.

LEEZA	Arvind!  What if I don’t want to run this restaurant?

LEEZA	What if I want to go to medical school?

LEEZA	What?

ARVIND	Sorry.

DR. PERKINS	The final choice isn’t going to be made on ophthalmic criteria.  

DR. PERKINS	It’ll probably be made on a candidate’s personality.

DR. EVANS	His ability to cope with the success or failure of the operation.

LEEZA	Do you want to join me for lunch across the road?

LEEZA	I got turkey and cheese.

DANNY	Have any shrimp?

LEEZA	No.

DANNY	Alright.

DANNY	My brother Larry, when I was a kid,…

DANNY	told me kids were supposed to run free in the park, ‘cause that’s what parks were for.

DANNY	He didn’t tell me about trees.

DANNY	I really hate trees.  A lot. 

DANNY	Wanna take a walk?

LEEZA	Wait.  You want me to follow you?

DANNY	No. You lead.  Just give me your shoulder.

LEEZA	Where are we going?

DANNY	You like baseball?

LEEZA	I don’t know.  I’ve never been.

DANNY	You’d love it.

DANNY	It’s a beautiful game.  I mean, you got the smell of the grass.   

DANNY	You get the sound of the ball when it gets crushed.   

LEEZA	Maybe I should go sometime.
 
LEEZA	Has Dr. Perkins talked to you about the operation?

DANNY	Yeah.  He said the final choice will be based on personality.

LEEZA	You’re not gonna have a problem there.

DANNY	I’m not so sure about that.

LEEZA	I’ve worked with a lot of visually impaired people…

LEEZA	and, I can honestly say, I have never met anyone like you.

DANNY	What do you mean?

LEEZA	Well, it’s this feeling you give to other people.  

LEEZA	And you don’t use your cane…

DANNY	I use my cane!

LEEZA	Not always.

LEEZA	And that’s stupid and dangerous and…also kind of brave.

LEEZA	Have you ever thought of a guide dog?

DANNY	I love dogs. I just got this problem with dog shit.

LEEZA	I guess what I’m trying to tell you is you’re okay.

DANNY	You think I’m okay enough to have dinner with me?

LEEZA	Okay.

MRS. RAJA	Who are the friends you’re going out with?

LEEZA	Just friends from the hospital, Mom.  Bye.

DANNY	I like that book too.  I mean, I like to read, but I love to watch movies.  

DANNY	In movies they don’t describe the trees and the sky…

DANNY	and the birds and all that stuff. They just talk.   

DANNY	And when I hear someone’s voice, it tells me so much about people.  

DANNY	Your voice tells me…

DANNY	that you have short, dark hair…
DANNY	that you have short, dark hair…

DANNY	and you have big, beautiful, dark eyes.

LEEZA	Dr. Perkins could’ve told you that.

DANNY	No.  It’s your voice.

DANNY	Your hair, I can tell that it’s short, because I can’t hear it swishing around.

DANNY	Although I did take a chance on your eyes, but now I know it’s true.  

DANNY	They are big and beautiful.

DANNY	I figure a lawyer’s got to be able to read peoples’ minds…

DANNY	and when you’re blind, that’s what you do.

LEEZA	And are you reading my mind?

LEEZA	And?

DANNY	I can tell that you want to be here…

DANNY	…but there’s also something holding you back, and I don’t know what it is.

LEEZA	I think you’re gonna be a very good lawyer.

LEEZA	What I’d really like to do is go to medical school.

LEEZA	And then join Dr. Perkins’ research team.

DANNY	Why can’t you?

LEEZA	It’s not that simple. I’m a woman.

DANNY	I noticed. 

LEEZA	And one day I’d like to get married and have a family.

DANNY	Can’t you do both?

LEEZA	Not without an understanding husband.

DANNY	Then you’re just gonna have to choose the right one.

JAY	That is one fine lady with you, Mr. Valdessecchi.

DANNY	Thank you, James.

DANNY	I can smell when Mrs. Luciano makes fettuccini from 3 blocks away…

DANNY	…or when they cut grass at a baseball field.  

DANNY	I love your perfume…

DANNY	…and your smile.

DANNY	Do you smell that?  The blossoms are out early this year.

LEEZA	Now you’re showing off.

DANNY	Is there anybody around?

LEEZA	No.
DANNY	I’ve had the best night I’ve ever had.  

DANNY	I just hope it’s been half as good for you.

LEEZA	I’ve had a wonderful time.

LARRY	An oil leak now.

LARRY	So, are you gonna tell me about it?

DANNY	She’s the most natural person in the whole world.

DANNY	And she’s got the most beautiful smile.

LARRY	How do you know what a smile looks like?

DANNY	It’s the sound of it.    

DANNY	I love the sound of her smile.

LARRY	So why didn’t you take her back to my place last night?

DANNY	Because not everything’s gotta come down to sex!

LARRY	That’s true.  Money and looks are important too.

LARRY	Hey, Mike! Don’t forget to clean those footprints off my ceiling!

DANNY	Unbelievable!

LARRY	What’s so unbelievable?

DANNY	Your face.

LARRY	It’s hot.

DANNY	Hi.

LEEZA	They’re gorgeous, thank you.

DANNY	Do you like Humphrey Bogart?

LEEZA	I like Humphrey Bogart.

DANNY	Let’s go, kid.

BERGMAN	What about us?

BOGART	We’ll always have Paris.

BOGART	We’d lost it and, until you came to Casablanca, we got it back last night.

BERGMAN	When I said I would never leave you.

BOGART	And you never will.  I’ve got a job to do, too.

LEEZA	I’ve gotta go.

DANNY	No.  Don’t go.

DANNY	Leeza, I’ve never felt this way for anyone before.

LEEZA	I’ll see you soon.

DANNY	Yeah.

LEEZA	Bye. 

MR. BHAT	Arvind will take over the business in a few years, when I retire.

MR. BHAT	And with a loyal wife by his side, he will be well able to provide for his family.

MR. RAJA	His ability to provide for his future family’s in no doubt, because he’s Indian.

MR. RAJA	And there should be no doubt about the loyalty of his future wife either.

ANGELO	I wanna tell you how proud we all are of you, Danny.

ANGELO	First, for getting chosen for this operation,…

ANGELO	and second, for having the palle to go through with it.

MARIE	What does “palle” mean?

LARRY	Balls.

DANNY	Stop corrupting Marie.  Please.

DANNY	Thank you, Pop.  Thank you, Larry.

DANNY	I would just like to say that, this thing does work out,…

DANNY	and I can see your faces for the first time…

DANNY	and I find out you’re all too ugly, I’m movin’ out.

DANNY	Dr. Perkins says, if it’s successful,…

DANNY	I might be able to see well enough to get around,…

DANNY	even identify faces.  

DANNY	I might be able to see your face.

DANNY	I’ll know what you look like.

MRS. RAJA	Only a man can cause joy one day and tears the next.

MRS. RAJA	What has Arvind done?

LEEZA	It isn’t Arvind.

MRS. RAJA	Is he Hindu?

LEEZA	He’s not Indian.

MRS. RAJA	A few years after I came to this country, I met this man, an American.

MRS. RAJA	He was very handsome, like a movie star.

MRS. RAJA	Every time I saw him, my heart jumped.

LEEZA	Mom!  What happened?

MRS. RAJA	He met a beautiful American girl.

MRS. RAJA	Nothing to be sad about. Just thankful!  

MRS. RAJA	I met your father after that.

MRS. RAJA	You’re my only daughter.  And I love you very much.

MRS. RAJA	But you made a promise to Arvind.

MRS. RAJA	Only you can decide if you can honor that promise or not.

LEEZA	I’m sorry.  I should have told you earlier.

DANNY	What are you talking about? 

LEEZA	Danny, I’ve had a wonderful time with you,…

LEEZA	and no one’s ever made me feel this way,…

LEEZA	but I’m engaged to be married.

DANNY	What is that supposed to mean?

LEEZA	It means I can’t see you anymore.

DANNY	Am I missing something here?  I don’t understand.

LEEZA	I’m sorry.  I should have told you earlier.

DANNY	Do you love this guy?

DANNY	Do you?!

LEEZA	He’s a nice guy.

DANNY	That doesn’t answer my question.  

LEEZA	It’s not that simple.  There’s a lot more to it than that.

DANNY	Just be honest with me. At the end of the day,…

DANNY	you’d rather be with someone who can see, instead of some blind guy.

LARRY	I know what it’s like to get dumped.  

LARRY	What you gotta do is look at it like you’re one of these ‘1-in-10’ guys.

LARRY	For every 10 “no’s” you get, you’re gonna get one “yes”.

LARRY	So, this “no” is really just bringin’ you closer to a “yes”.

LARRY	It’s all mathematics.

JAY	Ready!  Set!  Pitch!

JAY	That would’ve been a double for sure! I smell money.

DANNY	It doesn’t bother you that I can’t see?

DANNY	Even at school, and you had to help me all the time?

JAY	It’s those girls you’ve been datin’.

DANNY	I just don’t get it.

JAY	Look, Danny, girls are something you cannot figure out.
 
JAY	But if they can’t realize you’re a good catch, screw ‘em!

JAY	You a wild man! Your hormones are jumpin’.  C’mon, next pitch.

LEEZA	Where are we going?

ARVIND	I just wanted to get some air.

ARVIND	And so does your family.

ARVIND	It’s okay.  You look so beautiful tonight.

ARVIND	I just wanted a little time alone with you.

ARVIND	These pumpkins have been calling out to me all night. 

ARVIND	We’re getting married!

LEEZA	We can wait… 

ARVIND	They’re not coming!  

LEEZA	I’m sorry…  

LARRY	…9…10…11…

DANNY	Larry, bar – 

LARRY	I’m sorry, buddy!

LARRY	There you go.  Pump them out.  You look good.

BODY BUILDER	Need some help?

LARRY	I got it.

DANNY	Push through it.  You got it.

DANNY	That’s it.

DANNY	Good.

LARRY	I’m done.

DANNY	Another one won’t rupture you.

BODY BUILDER	Very impressive.

LARRY	Let’s go hit the showers.

DANNY	Pick something cool.  Think James Dean.  

DANNY	Did you mess up my hair?

MARIE	It looks fine.

MARIE	So, who’d Larry fix you up with this time?

DANNY	Larry tells me you’re in the service industry. What do you do, exactly?

DOLORES	The “service industry”.  

DOLORES	I like that. 

DOLORES	This is Dolores.

DOLORES	Yeah, it’s $500.
DOLORES	Not including cab fare.

DOLORES	Call me in… 

DOLORES	…2 hours.

DOLORES	No, I don’t do seniors.  

DANNY	Oh, come on!

DANNY	No, she was great.  We had a good time.  

LARRY	Where’s Dolores?

DANNY	What did I say?!  No hookers!

JAY	Get in the car, Danny!

JAY	Larry, you alright?

LARRY	You punch like a bitch!

DANNY	Shut your mouth and get in the car, you pussy!

LARRY	Danny, I was trying to help out.

LARRY	I figured maybe you could use a little push.

LARRY	There’s one other girl I was thinkin’ about settin’ you up with.

LARRY	She’s a real bombshell.  New client of mine.

LARRY	Top-class action.

DANNY	No.

LARRY	Fine.

DANNY	Fine.

DANNY	She’s top-class?

LARRY	It’s what I said.

DANNY	Alright.  On one condition.

LARRY	What?

DANNY	She can’t know I’m blind.

LARRY	Are you nuts?!

LARRY	It’s too risky. And I don’t see the point of it.

DANNY	The point is crystal clear.

DANNY	On each of the dates, they weren’t dating me.  They were dating some blind guy.

DANNY	I don’t want their pity.

LARRY	You don’t want a sympathy lay? 

DANNY	At least you’re on the right track.

LARRY	How do you think you’re gonna pull this off?  

DANNY	Easy.

LARRY	Are you ready?

LARRY	Alright, now you got the step…

DANNY	I know this step.   

DANNY	1… 2… 3… 4…

LARRY	Hold on.  Tell me what’s to your left.

DANNY	Thank you, Larry. 

JAY	Good evening, Mr. Valdessecchi.

DANNY	Bling you very much, James.

PIETRO	Ah, Senor!  The corner table, as usual?

DANNY	1…2…3…4…5.

LARRY	Thank you, Pietro.

DANNY	Bottle of your Silver Vineyard syrah.

PIETRO	Say, “Something earthy and jammy.”

PIETRO	Well done. 

LARRY	A little louder.  Not too loud, though. That’s good.   

LARRY	And this is a 6-CD changer.

LARRY	If she doesn’t like the music, you hit this button here, and it changes the CD.  

LARRY	Just be careful with it.

LARRY	That’s FM radio.

LARRY	No. All you have to do is push “play”.

LARRY	Be very careful with it.

LARRY	That’s not funny.

LARRY	Alright, Danny, look.   

LARRY	If you get this far, you’re gonna need one of these.

LARRY	That’s a condom.  It’s for safe sex.  

LARRY	There’s nothing worse than a blind guy with genital warts.

DANNY	It’s squidgy.

LARRY	Yes, Danny.  

LARRY	This is something you’ll have to do on your own.

LARRY	But think of it like homework.

LARRY	Not now.  

LARRY	Oh, you like that condom, don’t you? 

DANNY	Larry, none of ‘em fit!

DANNY	I put ‘em on, but they’re too big!  They keep on falling off!

LARRY	That’s impossible!  You’re a Valdessecchi.

DANNY	I’ve been trying for the last 2 hours!

LARRY	You stayed up for 2 hours?

DANNY	What do you mean, ‘up’?

LARRY	You can’t put the condom on unless you’re stiff, you know?

DANNY	You never told me that!

LARRY	What is that?

DANNY	Just opening another one, see if it fits.

LARRY	Are you chewing on the condoms?!

DANNY	It tastes like heaven.

LARRY	Why are you puttin’ me on?!  You know I’m busy now?!

DANNY	Thank you, James.

JAY	I need a moment of your time, sir.

ANDRE	It’s going to be about an hour.

ANDRE	5 minutes.

ANDRE	Good evening.  Do you have a reservation?

DANNY	Yes.  Where’s Pietro?

ANDRE	He’s out with a flu, so he says.   

ANDRE	What was the name on the reservation?

DANNY	Valdessecchi.

ANDRE	Right this way.

ANDRE	Excuse me, Senor.  Your table is this way.

DANNY	Corner table, right?

ANDRE	No.  As you can see, this table is occupied.

DANNY	Sorry.

DANNY	Sushi.

ANDRE	Yes, sir?

DANNY	I arranged the corner table with Pietro.

ANDRE	He did not tell me.

ANDRE	Right this way.

DANNY	Excuse me.  

ANDRE	Sir, is everything alright? 

DANNY	Tell me, how far is it to the table from here?

ANDRE	I beg your pardon?  

DANNY	Listen carefully.

DANNY	From where I’m standing, how many steps is it to the table?

ANDRE	I’d say about 20.

DANNY	Which direction?  Use hours on a clock face.

ANDRE	9 o’clock.

DANNY	Anything in the way?

ANDRE	No.

DANNY	Now, walk in front of me – slowly – and keep talking, so I know where you are.

ANDRE	Look, I don’t know what’s going on –

DANNY	Why didn’t you tell me you were stopping?

ANDRE	I didn’t know I had to!

ANDRE	It won’t happen again. Right this way, sir.

ANDRE	Here’s your table.

DANNY	Great.

JASMINE	What took you so long?

DANNY	I was just saying hi to some friends.

DANNY	From Japan.

JASMINE	Well, this is my good side.

DANNY	Want some wine?   

JASMINE	Oh, yes!

DANNY	Waiter!

WINE WAITER	Wine, sir?

DANNY	Perfect. I will take the bottle of your Single Vineyard syrah.  

DANNY	That’s earthy and jammy, right?

DANNY	Let’s order!  I’m starving!

JASMINE	You have some chocolate sauce on your chin.

JASMINE	You are not doing a good job of cleaning that up.   Let me.

JASMINE	You’re so different from the other men I date.  You’re like a little boy.

JASMINE	But you know what I like best about you? Your eyes.

JASMINE	And the way you look at me.  

JASMINE	We can go back to your place now.

DANNY	Check!

ANDRE	Pleasure

JASMINE	You silly little boy.

JASMINE	Who needs ice cream when you’ve got dessert like this?

JASMINE	It’s such a sexy night, don’t you think?

DANNY	It is.

DANNY	Oh my God!  I’m so sorry! Are you alright?
