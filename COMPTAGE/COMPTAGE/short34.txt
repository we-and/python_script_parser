THE EARL OF SODOR	Well, Hello! The Earl of Sodor here! You know, Sodor is such an exciting place. There are so many wonderful things to see! But, just how closely are you watching..? ...Very closely I hope, because I'll be asking questions about what you've seen. Sir Topham Hatt doesn't approve of Thomas racing with Bertie. But I think it looks like jolly good fun! Well done, Thomas. You've won the race! Now you can race to the next station.. With a little help from the Fireman, who's making sure your firebox has lots of fuel. Are you ready for the first question? What type of fuel does Thomas use? Is it logs? Is it carrots? Or is it coal? Thomas uses coal as fuel. The Fireman puts coal into Thomas' firebox. The heat from his firebox turns water into steam, which powers Thomas' wheels.... Hooray that was fun! Let's play again.It's Spencer's job to take his very important passenger to Knapford Station to meet Sir Topham Hatt But Spencer's in such a rush he's not paying attention and he's going the wrong way...This isn't Knapford Station... And that certainly doesn't look like Sir Topham Hatt! What sort of animal was standing on the platform? Was it a dog? Was it a giraffe? Or was it a cow? It was a giraffe! Oh dear! If you hadn't rushed, you wouldn't have gone the wrong way and been late Spencer. Jolly Well done! Do come back again soon. Goodbye!
