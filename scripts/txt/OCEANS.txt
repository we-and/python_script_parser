PAM	Josh?
PAM	What is it?
JOSH	I'll drive.
RYAN	Computers and telecoms are up on the genny I'll make sure that the ISDN has power.
RON	I was looking for Pam, but the sky is literally falling, Josh.
JOSH	Checking with my planet to figure out why.
RON	Great. Look, could you fix your attention on my son Ali, for a minute?
RON	No. really. You need to. Just be a human being for one minute, alright?
RON	I'll be back, okay?
JOSH	Okay.
RON	That's an order.
JOSH	Yeah.
JOSH	Did you know that Earth is filled with liquid, see?
JOSH	It's molten, iron, and nickel.
JOSH	The fact that it's spinning generates a magnetic field
JOSH	that keeps us safe from all kinds of space radiation.
JOSH	[ chuckle ]
JOSH	Without it, the air that gives us the ability to live...
JOSH	would just sputter away....
JOSH	into outer space...
JOSH	and we die.
PAM	You just can't tell a baby we're going to die, Josh.
JOSH	Yes, I can.
PAM	No.
JOSH	Question is, what is he going to do about?
RON	Thank you, Pam.	
PAM	Oh.
RON	Oh. [ chuckles ]
RON	You ready for the meeting?
PAM	Yeah. Ready.
PAM	[ clears throat ]
JOSH	Anything bothering you, Pam?
PAM	I'm about to get skewered, Josh. Can you be more specific?
JOSH	The solar flare happened at the same time as those 8+ quakes.
PAM	Uh-huh.
JOSH	North Pole launches over two thousand miles in the same exact night.
PAM	Oh, come on.
JOSH	And aside from the electricity being out.
JOSH	Tiksi, Siberia is Santa's new home. Ho ho ho.
PAM	Are you sure?
JOSH	Calculated the magnetic variance myself.
JOSH	Pam, I think this signals a polarity reversal.
PAM	Well, it's scary, I know. But it's not totally unprecedented.
PAM	I mean, it happens, what, every half a million years.  
JOSH	Anthropologists believe that the last big one, 780,000 years ago,	
JOSH	and that was a massive extinction event.
JOSH	Now, large fossil mammal records are hard to come by, but I think--
PAM	Josh! 600 Extra High Voltage power transformers just blewacross North America
PAM	because of a CME wedidn't see coming.
PAM	All the lights are out. Everywhere.
PAM	Now I need to go in there and tell the Secretary of Energy why this isn't my fault.
PAM	So, please. Can this wait?
JOSH	No! If this is what can happen to us from a solar storm with a magnetic field,
JOSH	I've got to tell them about it.
PAM	Oh no, Josh!
PAM	You're smart.
PAM	You're so smart. When you started working here I gambled
PAM	that you were totally worth it if you filed a title 7against me.
JOSH	Is it too late to claim a harassment?
PAM	So be smart enough to know you can't just go in there and say
PAM	that you think the Earth's outer core is slowing down,
PAM	Oh, and by the way a GS-13 from Colorado would love to just borrow the two most powerful
PAM	particle colliders to see if he could try to speed it up.
PAM	That's not how it works, Sweetie.
JOSH	If I tell them about the impending danger,
JOSH	they're going to have to do something about it!
PAM	Yeah! Like find another practical physicist to do your job.
JOSH	Pam!
JOSH	Pam! Wait!
PAM	[scoffs]
JOSH	Pam!
JOSH	Dammit. Dr. Cushing!
PAM	[ gasp ]
JOSH	What is it?
PAM	I lost them.
JOSH	What?
PAM	The embryos, they didn't take.
JOSH	Oh, Pam. I'm sorry.
JOSH	I'm so sorry.
PAM	It just feel like it wasn't meant to be, you know?
JOSH	I know. I know.I know. I know.
JOSH	Think about this.Maybe's for the best.
JOSH	What I mean is...
JOSH	We have a lot to handle right now and the world needs us.
PAM	I need you.
JOSH	I know.
PAM	Do you understand?
JOSH	Yes.
PAM	Are you listening?
JOSH	You want me to keep quiet.
PAM	Yes.
PAM	Please.
PAM	You have a habit of--
JOSH	Saying what's on my mind?
PAM	Pissing people off.
PAM	I'm up against it. My department needs funding. Please don't blow this for me.
JOSH	This reverse polarity is a serious thing, Pam. It can be life ending.
PAM	Then publish an article. Build a consensus. I don't know.
PAM	On paper no one can tell you don't care what they think. 
JOSH	And I can just, what, sit around and wait for a peer review while the magnetosphere
JOSH	disappears above my head and they can argue about punctuation?
PAM	Then get your own meeting.
PAM	A temblor?
JOSH	The nearest fault's in the Springs, a hundred miles away.
JOSH	And it's inactive.
PAM	[ sniffs ]
RON	Not the right day to smell the roses, Pam.
RON	Homeland security protocolskicked in when the power went down,
RON	so we're going live from Camp David. The President will be joining us.
SECRETARY	Ron, can you hear me?
RON	Yes. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. We are a go on our end.
SECRETARY	Terrific. My hosts at CERN have been gracious enough to allow me 
SECRETARY	the use of their hard-wired collider control room feed.
MADAME PRESIDENT	This way? Okay.
MADAME PRESIDENT	Thank you for waiting.
MADAME PRESIDENT	What is the status?
RON	Madame President.
RON	I'm the Director of NOAA Space Weather, Ron Livingston,
RON	this is the Deputy Director and satellite liaison to NASA,Pamela Cushing.
RON	She oversees the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
MADAME PRESIDENT	So what happened, and why were we caught with our pants down?
PAM	The sun blasted us with three waves radiation, ionization, and a violent Coronal Mass Ejection.
PAM	Sunspots more powerful than a billion thermonuclear weapons, 
PAM	traveling at over 1,000 kilometers per second.
PAM	That's what caused thespectacular aurora borealis as far as Panama.
PAM	And that's what destroyed ourgeodetic satellites. As well as our power transformers.
MADAME PRESIDENT	We were utterly unaware andcompletely unprepared?
SECRETARY	Madame President. Space Weather predicted heightened coronal mass ejections.
SECRETARY	The record reflects their warnings.
MADAME PRESIDENT	Well, it wasn't enough!
PAM	Ma'am, if I may. Werecommend steps to mitigate the damage
PAM	in case sunspots threaten the Earth again.
PAM	If we directly link regional power systems to advanced warning
PAM	from Solar Dynamics Observatory. We can build back a better infrastructure.
PAM	These steps will cost money.
PAM	Thankfully, our magnetic field deflected most of the sun's
discharge.
PAM	My colleague and husband, Joshua Chamberlain, from the US Geological Survey,
PAM	can talk about the threat confronting our planet.
PAM	Josh.
JOSH	Um.
JOSH	Hi. I'm Joshua Chamberlain ofthe US Geological Survey,
JOSH	and I'm worried about a solar flare hitting our weakening
JOSH	magnetic field, Madame President.
JOSH	It is weakening. Dramatically.
DR. ZICREE	Excuse me.
DR. ZICREE	Sorry to interrupt. But--
JOSH	Dr. Zicree, sir. It is anhonor and I was looking forward to talking with you about
JOSH	the Large Hadron Collider andhelping us solve this problem.
DR. ZICREE	What exactly kind of problem doyou think we're having?
JOSH	Well, over the past millennia our magnetic field has been
JOSH	decreasing by over 5% per century,
JOSH	and in the last 100 years that has accelerated to over 10%.
MADAME PRESIDENT	I'd like to focus on preventing mega solar storms from
MADAME PRESIDENT	destroying our nationsinfrastructure.
JOSH	That is what I am talking about, Madame President.
JOSH	If our magnetic field were to dwindle or disappear entirely due to a polarity reversal.
JOSH	Then the same storm would cause  epic tectonic dislocation and atmospheric sputtering.
JOSH	And the end of all human life as we know it. Aside from just some down power lines. [ laughs ]
JOSH	Continents sinking.
RON	Chamberlain.  Please.
PAM	Josh, sit down.
JOSH	That's why I propose jump-starting the Earth's core.
DR. ZICREE	It's impossible.
JOSH	That's not impossible. You can use CERNS's LHC and the Relativistic Ion collider
DR. ZICREE	over at Brookhaven...
MADAME PRESIDENT	what the hell does this have to do with sunspots?
JOSH	If we were to creat dual singularities at both facilities,
JOSH	we can capitalize on the current retrofits.
SECRETARY	Black holes.
DR. ZICREE	You want to create black holes in two particle colliders?
DR. ZICREE	On purpose? Are you serious?
RON	Chamberlain, that is enough.
JOSH	Yes. I believe the gravitons emitted, I believe would jumpstart the dynamo effect.
JOSH	Getting the Earth's core spinning again.
JOSH	Thus recharging the magnetosphere.
MADAME PRESIDENT	Alright. Thank you, sir.
JOSH	If another solar flare hits our planet and our magnetic field is down--
ZICREE	If.
JOSH	The Earth would turn into Mars!
PAM	Josh. Time to go.
MADAME PRESIDENT 	Would you please escort this man out?
JOSH	No Oxygen.  No life.
RON	You are through. Get him out of here.
JOSH	That's it.
JOSH	This is all happening right now and nobody cares about it.
RON	Thank you. Madame President,I apologize.
JOSH	I can't believe those people.
PAM	what were you thing, Josh.
JOSH	Oh, I don't know,
JOSH	maybe if they give a damn.
PAM	I have to go back in thereand repair the damage.
PAM	The damage you just did to our career. Are you so blind that you can't see?
PAM / JOSH	[ screaming ]
PAM / JOSH	[ screaming ]
PAM	Are you okay?
JOSH	No.
PAM	Do you want me to keep the rest of it?
JOSH	You can come with me.
PAM	Because the end is near?
JOSH	Because I can't stay.
JOSH	What choice do I have?
PAM	You can stay and fight.
JOSH	[ sigh ]
JOSH	I hear Texas is nicethis time of year.
PAM	Yeah. What time is that, exactly?
JOSH	Well, I don't know.
JOSH	Background in geology and a Presidential restraining order.
JOSH	I hear that gets you a six figure salary in the Lone Star State.
JOSH	Not buying it, huh?
PAM	You're still not listening.
PAM	They're only empowered to do so much. It takes time.
JOSH	What if we don't -- What if we don't have time?
JOSH	You know this could happen.
PAM	Of course it could happen.
PAM	The Colorado River could flood. The big one could take Salt Lake,
PAM	New York, and LA all in the same day. But what about us?
PAM	What about our life?
PAM	If this happens, if you're right, I wanna be in a position where I could help people.
PAM	Don't you?
JOSH	They think - they think I'm delusional.
JOSH	[ hard sigh ]
JOSH	When you think they're ready to listen,
JOSH	give me a call.
PAM	And if this actually happens, what are you going to do about it?
JOSH	I'll build a boat.
JOSH	And when everything sinks, we'll float away.
PAM	Away from me?
JOSH	It's not what I want.
PAM	You want me to just drop everything because you didn't get what you want? 
JOSH	We can be together! Just you and me!
PAM	you talk about your Dad
PAM	not doing anything meaningful with his life?
PAM	What about you?
PAM	What are you doing?
PAM	Quitting. Going boating.
JOSH	My mother stood by my father through his drinking.
JOSH	His whoring.
JOSH	When he was embezzling paper clips from the requisitions office.
JOSH	He was left less than honorably discharged and they cut his pension in half.
JOSH	Throughout all that she stood by his side.
JOSH	Didn't say a word. 
JOSH	And I speak up to save the world,
JOSH	you laugh at me.
PAM	I didn't laugh at you.
PAM	I gave you a chance. I gave you a huge chance. I put my career on the line for you.
PAM	What did you do? You blew it.
PAM	Just like you're blowing it now.
JOSH	Yeah, well, you know what, Pam?
JOSH	Just burn the rest of my stuff because it isn't gonna matter anyway.
PAM	Josh?
TELEVISION REPORTER	Tectonic instability at the Poles has accelerated the ice caps melting, radically.
TELEVISION REPORTER	This latest tidal wave has just swallowed the populous portions of America's second largest city,
TELEVISION REPORTER	overwhelming Southern California's coastal defensesafter the 7.1 earthquake 
TELEVISION REPORTER	of the coast this morning.
TELEVISION REPORTER	While it's almost impossible tocomprehend,
TELEVISION REPORTER	the loss of life must be staggering,
TELEVISION REPORTER	and emergency workers are struggling with the enormity of the task
TELEVISION REPORTER	of recovering survivors as remote a possibility as that seems.
TELEVISION REPORTER	The death toll, the destruction-
PAM	Hello?
TELEVISION REPORTER	The utter loss of life is breath--
PAM	Yeah.
PAM	Bangladesh?
PAM	It's completely under water?
PAM	What about the North Pole?
PAM	The magnetosphere is registering at 11 microteslas.
PAM	That's 1/3 its usual-- and it's falling?
PAM	[ clear throat ]
PAM	Okay. Thank you.
PAM	Michael?
PAM	I need you to get me a ticket to Galveston.
PAM	No. It can't be tomorrow.
PAM	No. It has to be today.
PAM	Well, charter it if you have to, but I'm wheels up in 90 minutes.
PAM	Alright. Thanks. Bye.
PAM	Savory stroganoff. Josh.
JOSH	I thought you were gonna call?
PAM	I did.
PAM	You never called me back.
JOSH	Yeah. My hands have been full. But looks like yours have been too.
PAM	Looking forward to floating away?
PAM	[ clears throat ]
PAM	Look, I'm sorry. I--
PAM	I didn't come here to fight with you.
JOSH	Hey if you want to stroll down
JOSH	memory lane, I'm a little busy.
JOSH	But you're more than welcome to help.
PAM	I came here to tell you themagnetosphere has weakened dramatically,
PAM	and it's fading fast.
JOSH	I know. It was my job to track it, remember?
JOSH	I still hear things. Not everybody in Boulder thinks I'm a charlatan.
PAM	[ under breath ] I never thought you were a charlatan.
JOSH	Hey! Can you pick up the pace? 
PAM	Did you hear about the latest solar storm?
JOSH	Why do you think I'm loading the boat?
JOSH	The official reports don't account for salt water's expansion co-efficient in heat. 
JOSH	Another helium energy burst sends a flare to Earth, 
JOSH	and all this under water.
PAM	Why did you pick Galveston? 
JOSH	People here have survived three floods.	
JOSH	When you tell them something like the water's gonna rise,
JOSH	nobody looks at you crazy.
PAM	I've missed you.
PAM	Look, I didn't come here to help you escape.
PAM	I came because you can help people survive.
PAM 	We need you.
JOSH	[ scoffs ]
JOSH	Who's we?
PAM	You left, and it hasn't been easy without you, but
PAM	I'm in a position to help people.
PAM	And since it's about to hit thefan, maybe you can help me too?
PAM	How far can you make iton this thing?
PAM	I mean, how long can you make it alone, Josh?
JOSH	I've got enough fuel and stroganoff to make it as far as
I want.
JOSH	As far as how much time I've got...
JOSH	I don't know, Pam.
JOSH	How long do any of us have?
PAM	You're not gonna get a better offer, Josh.
PAM	This planet is all you've got.
JOSH	You're amazing.
JOSH	And you're the person I loved.
JOSH	And now you're here in front of me, and I can't stand to look at you.
JOSH	No. No. I'm sorry.
JOSH	I can't. I'm sorry.
JOSH	I can't.
PAM	Josh!
PAM	Josh!
PAM	Get in the car! Now!
JOSH	You want to get in that? Are you insane? We're at 13 feet, you've got 60 seconds.
JOSH	Get on the boat. Now!
PAM	What about the boxes?
JOSH	Don't worry about that.
JOSH	I'll undo the lines. You just close the open hatch! 
PAM	What about you?
JOSH	Don't worry about me. I'll get topside. Move!
PAM	[efforts throughout]
PAM	Josh!
PAM	Josh!
JOSH	[efforts swimming]
PAM	Josh.
PAM	Come on.
PAM	I thought you were gone.
PAM	[ crying ] I thought you were gone.	 
JOSH	Well... My knife's gone.
PAM / JOSH	[ laughing ]
PAM	You haven't changed much, have you?
JOSH	I wouldn't say that, Dr. Cushing.
PAM	Oh. So is that how's it's going to be?
PAM	It was fine back then. You weren't even working for me.
JOSH	Yeah, well, you were hitting on me from the next office over.
PAM	[ laughing ] Permission to come aboard Captain?
PAM	[ laughing ]
JOSH	[mocks Pam] I guess.
PAM	Jerk!
JOSH	Owh!
PAM	You saved me. You saved my life.
JOSH	Well, I didn't have a lot of time to think over my options.
PAM	You still can't stand me?
PAM	Right.
PAM	Okay. What do we do now?
JOSH	Well, I tried to tell them three years ago.
PAM	Okay. Well, what about now?
JOSH	Now?
PAM	Yeah.
JOSH	the caps Are gone.
JOSH	The world is tearing itself apart. Literally.
PAM	Well, the man I knew wanted to do something about that.
JOSH	Fine. Play Coast Guard. We'll pick up as many people as we
JOSH	can, and fill this boat up.
JOSH	And the sail for Boulder. I should still be above water.
PAM	Then you'll float away after all.
PAM	You should have built a bigger boat.
JOSH	Yeah, well it turns out making six figures in Texas was a little harder than I thought.
JOSH	I was unemployed.
PAM	[ laughs ] Well, whose fault is that?
JOSH	Pam, kill the engine.
JOSH	Survivors off the bow.
JOSH	[ grunt ] Grab the line!
JOSH	Take hold of the ring!
MARJORIE	Grab my shoulders. Grab my shoulders. [ grunts ]
JOSH	Alright. I got you. Come on.
MARJORIE	[ speaking Spanish ] Mijo, mis hombros.
JOSH	Good. Good. Come on.
JOSH	Is that everybody?
MARJORIE	Everybody's that's left-- Yes!
MARJORIE	[ crying ]
JOSH	Come inside. Come inside.
MARJORIE	If you hadn't have come on time, I don't know what would have happened to us.
JOSH	You're okay, buddy. You're safe, Alright?
MARJORIE	[ speaking Spanish ] Muevete! Muevete!-- Thank you! Thank you!
JOSH	Get inside. Go ahead.
PAM	We got another one coming. Other there.
JOSH	Hello!
GREG	Where you headed?
JOSH	We're not really sure yet. We're just - We're trying to help!
GREG	You got food?
JOSH	Some.
GREG	Alright.
GREG	I'll come.
GREG	[ efforts ]
JOSH	Come on.
JOSH	 Come on up. Come on up. You alright?
MOLLY	[ efforts ]
JOSH	You okay? Good.
JOSH	Good. There it is. Good. Come on.
JOSH	You alright?
EARL	Yeah.
JOSH	Got it?
EARL	Thank you.
JOSH	Alright.
JOSH	Sir!
JOSH	Step into the buoy!
JOSH	Put your feet in the--
MEL	What?!
JOSH	Your feet! The life saver!
MEL	What? I can't hear you!
JOSH	The life saver!
MEL	I'm hard of hearing!
JOSH	(mutter to self) Man.
ROB	Did anyone give you permission to turn that on?
GREG	No, my phone is fried, and I'm looking for the Wifi.
ROB	Get up.
ROB	This isn't your mom's house, kid.
ROB	You can't waste their power--
GREG	Sorry, dude. Sorry. Calm down.
ROB	Use some common sense.
NICK	Aww, Darn it!
NICK	That's my lucky hat.
PHIL	It wasn't working for you anyway.
GREG	There. You happy?
GREG	[ scoffs ] God.
PHIL	So hey, how did you know that this flood coming to have a boat ready like this?
JOSH	I used to be a scientist for the USGS. I tried to warm
JOSH	my superiors something like this could happen.
NICK	What happened?
JOSH	I built a boat instead.
NICK	Anybody else's ears just pop?
PHIL	That's funny.
PHIL	Why would the air pressure change?	
JOSH	Get inside!
PHIL	What?
JOSH	Get inside now! Get inside!
JOSH	Come on! Move! Move! Move! It's an ozone hole!
PHIL	Your head!
PHIL	My gosh! Your head!
NICK	Ah!
NICK	[ screaming ]
JOSH	Inside! Inside!
NICK	[ screaming ]
NICK	I can feel my skull! My skin is falling off.
JOSH	Easy. Easy.
MOLLY	What's happening?
GREG	Keep that open. It's hot in here, man!
JOSH	Pam.
MOLLY	Okay. These burns are bad.
MOLLY	Look, I took first aid while teaching pre-school.
MOLLY	I don't - I don't--
JOSH	Here. See what you can do.
MOLLY	Oh, wait, wait, wait. You don't look good, either.
JOSH	No, no. Later. I'm okay. 
JOSH	I'll be fine.
MOLLY	[ scoffs ]
GREG	Alright. Thank you.
PAM	Hey. How's it going down--
PAM	Josh, you have to wear sunscreen.
JOSH	Yeah. There's not enough sunblock on the planet to stop this.
JOSH	Have you seen this? Come on. I got to get you down below.
PAM	I can't see obstacles from down there.
JOSH	Look at the sky. It's grayer, isn't it? 
PAM	I thought it was just clouds.
JOSH	Those aren't clouds. That's our oxygen leaking out if the atmosphere.
JOSH	Less refraction, less blue.
PAM	No.
PAM	It's too soon.
JOSH	No. Maybe this is a localized hole. But our mid-latitude ozone
JOSH	is 50% thinner then it was 40 years ago.
JOSH	It doesn't thin evenly.
PAM	But if we're loosing ozone--
JOSH	That could only mean that our atmosphere is sputtering and leaking into outer space.
JOSH	It'll start slowly at first but, then it will accelerate.
JOSH	And there is nothing you can do about it.
PAM	What?
PAM	What happened to you? You knew this was going to happen. You had a plan.
JOSH	I had a lot of things, Pam.
JOSH	Now, I have a boat full of guests. 
PAM	Well, could it work?
PAM	The black holes on the opposite end of the planet.
JOSH	I don't - I don't know.
JOSH	I don't know. This is all happening a lot faster then I calculated.
JOSH	I honestly don't know.
PAM	Alright. Well, that's not good enough. Not by a damn sight.
PAM	You're not persuading me, you're not persuading anyone else like that. And you're
PAM	Earth's last hope, Josh.
JOSH	Oh. So now you believe in me.
JOSH	I never didn't believe in you. [ scoffs ]
PAM	I put you in front of the president because what you had to say was important.
PAM	I risked my career for you, and you pay me back by walking out.
JOSH	That's not fair.
PAM	Oh yeah?
PAM	I still live in our old house.
PAM	I still have my old job.
PAM	I still have the footprints on my back to prove it. You walked out on me.
PAM	And it shouldn't have been that easy.
JOSH	I thought about you everyday.
JOSH	About us. About the children we were supposed to have.
JOSH	How your parents probably saying he's the guy we always thought he was going to be.
PAM	Stop.
JOSH	It's true.
PAM 	Think about what you said about my paper.
JOSH	[ laughs ] I didn't know you'd written it. 
PAM	You were the only person who read it, and you hated it.
JOSH	It was a bit extraneous.
JOSH	[ laughs ]
PAM	Well, there's the smart-ass I fell in love with.
PAM	Come on.
PAM	Can you do this?
JOSH	I...There's a lot of moving pieces. I can't do it alone.
PAM	No.
PAM	You never could.
PAM	So I'll set her out to Brookhaven and the RHIC, huh? 
JOSH	Long Island?
PAM	Yep.
JOSH	Somebody there's going to have to reprogram the firing sequence.
PAM	You're not the only one with a PhD.
JOSH	Then I'd sail to CERN?
JOSH	Without you?
PAM	If this boat can get youthere, yeah.		
PAM	Then you get what you wanted.
PAM	I'll go tell the others.
JOSH	Be careful what you wish for.
PAM	We have to get to Brookhaven as quick as possible,
PAM	or the entire planet could suffer irreversibly.
PAM	We're trying to save the world, guys.
ROB	When you fished me out of water you said you'd get me to dry land as quickly as possible.
PAM	I know. But with the poles melting so fast and tectonic displacement wiping out
PAM	land masses across the globe, we don't know where dry land actually is.
PAM	And we can't afford the time to stop and look for it.
EARL	How do you know Brookhaven will still be there if everything is bad as you say it is?
PAM	Well the lab is built on one of the highest points on the island,
PAM	and they're equipped to protect the particle collider against natural disasters.
NICK	This disaster's starting to feel super-natural. 
NICK	Like some kind of divine intervention.
PAM	[ sigh ]
PAM	Really?
PAM	You're getting a tan during the apocalypse?
JOSH	I thought I'd leave behind and attractive corpse.
PAM	That's not funny.
PAM	What about the ozone holes?
JOSH	I just wanted five minutes outside. Besides, Earl's said he's got the ship
JOSH	and he'd warn us if the sky grays out. 
PAM	You know, this is kind of amazing.	
PAM	You planned and put all this together.
PAM	There are ten people alive right now who wouldn't be without you.
PAM	Including me.
JOSH	You know we always made a pretty good team.
JOSH	You always made me see the possibilities.
JOSH	If I could go back and do it over, I'd do four things different.
JOSH	I wouldn't shop-lift condoms in 7th grade.
PAM	[ laughing ]
JOSH	I think I still have one fossilized in some velcro wallet somewhere.
PAM	[ laughing ] No,	
JOSH	Yeah.
JOSH	I wouldn't cheat on my SATs.
PAM	How did you cheat on your SATs?
JOSH	Dictionary in the bathroom.
PAM	[ scoff ] Wow.
JOSH	Yeah. Yeah. 
JOSH	I uh--
JOSH	You know I'm not good with words...
JOSH	I wouldn't have ordered so uch savory stroganoff.
PAM	[ laughs ]
JOSH	And...[ laughs ]
JOSH	I would have never... never walked out you.
PAM	How much longer until Brookhaven?
JOSH	[ sigh ] We're doing about 38 knots.
JOSH	And if I can trust my MINS navigation and  still somewhat read my compass,
JOSH	I'd say about a day.
JOSH	Is that a...
JOSH	is that too late to say I'm sorry?
PAM	Why don't we just save the world first.
PAM 	It's a lot for a girl to take in.
JOSH	You know,
JOSH	I've been trapped in a black hole for  three years,
JOSH	in this nightmare, alone.
JOSH	And then you show up,
JOSH	and everything feels exactly how it should.
JOSH	So,
JOSH	you saved me , too. Okay?	
PAM	Don't get burned.
MEL	[ vomiting ]
MEL	[ coughing/spittting ]
PHIL	You feeling okay?
MEL	What?
PHIL	Can I help you with anything?
MEL	I threw up.
PHIL	Okay.
RONALDO	Mommy, can I play with your phone?
RONALDO	Can I play with your phone?
MARJORIE	[ spanish ] Ay hijo.
MARJORIE	dejame en paz.Dejame dormir, Ronny.
RONALDO	I want to play on your phone.
MARJORIE	You know what, here you go. It's wet. It doesn't work.
MARJORIE	Nothing does, okay? Okay?
MARJORIE	Okay?!
GREG	It's fine. Hey buddy, what's up man? How it going?
GREG	Listen, can I get your help with something really quick?
GREG	I need to tie some knots in this rope,
GREG	and you know, I could use a finger just about this size. 
GREG	What do you say?
GREG 	You get some rest.
MARJORIE	Thank you.
GREG	Let's go.
PHIL	How's he - how's he doing?
MOLLY	Probably not going to kill him.
MOLLY	[ chuckles ] Lots of luck.
PHIL	Hang in there, buddy.	
PHIL	[ exhale ]
PHIL	He--
PHIL	Hey you.
PHIL	So, you do a lot of camping?
GREG	No.
PHIL	Mostly white water?
GREG	What?
PHIL	With the raft, I just figured that you got out doors a lot.
GREG	What is this, an interrogation?
PHIL	No. Not at all.
GREG	Well you just think I want to get to know you or something--
EARL	Listen. Look.
EARL	He didn't mean anything.
GREG	And what's it to you?
EARL	Nothing. I'm just follow tranquilo, okay?
GREG	Okay.
GREG	Relax, man. I'm just messing with you, alright?
GREG	What's your name?
PHIL	Phil?
GREG	Are you asking or telling?
PHIL	It's Phil. I'm Phil.I'm -  It's Phil.
GREG	You sure?
PHIL	Yep.
GREG	[ laughing ]
GREG	Alright, Phil.
GREG	Relax, man. I'm messing you. I'm Greg.
PHIL	Okay.
PHIL	Oh should we...?
GREG	Yeah.
PHIL	I thought--
GREG	Okay.
GREG	Why are you holding my arm?
PHIL	I felt the moment-- It's totally wrong.
PHIL	Impulse was-- Yep.
PHIL	I don't know why I did that?
PAM	Call CQ. Call CQ.
PAM	This is Pam Cushing NOAA Space Weather Director, 20 MegaHertz.
PAM	Looking for a fixed station or digipeter to respond. Copy?
PAM	Call CQ. Call CQ. This is Pam Cushing NOAA Space Weather Director, 20.01 MegaHertz.
PAM	Looking for a fixed station or digipeter to respond. Copy? 
JOSH	Grab spars, hook, and poles! I need people on every side of this boat.
JOSH	We're over buildings and houses. We're miles in from the coast.
JOSH	If we founder on a roof or hit a building, or something, we're sunk.
JOSH	I'm just saying.
PAM	what can I do?
JOSH	I need people with poles on the bow and the aft.
JOSH	If they see anything, anything, push the boat way from it.
JOSH	This is vital.
PAM	Okay. Got it.
PHIL	You had oars in you raft, didn't you?
GREG	Yeah. For paddling.
PHIL	We could lash those together, maybe?
PAM	Great! Phil and Greg make sure the oars are long enough.
PAM	Alright? Go!
PHIL	Come on.
PAM	Earl. Rob. Each of you take a pole and get topside.
PHIL	I'll use the oars-- Duct tape.
PHIL / GREG	[ overlapping dialogue ]
GREG	Just hold them.
PHIL	Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
PHIL	Okay. Okay.
PHIL	Nice.
PAM	Keep your eyes peeled and steer clear of any obstacles, got it?
EARL	Got it.
PAM	Great. Go!
PHIL	Duct tape. [overlapping dialogue ]
ROB	Got one!
ROB	We're going over a communications building. Look alive, guys!
JOSH	It's about a mile and a half of the starboard bow. I think they're in trouble.
EARL	Coming up! Tail end!
PHIL	Here. You got this?
GREG	Yeah. I Got it. Go ahead.
EARL	Okay.
PHIL	Wow.
PHIL	You okay, man?
GREG	Yeah, yeah. I'm good.
EARL	Hey man, look alive! This is serious!
GREG	Alright! Man, I got this, alright? Calm down!
GREG	Damn.
JOSH	Oh, man.
PAM	I got to get out there.
JOSH	I don't think that's a good idea.
PAM	Of course it's not a good idea.
JOSH	I don't want you anywhere near that building when those levees break.
PAM	That's why I have to keep them from breaking.
PAM	Who's in charge here? 
SOLDIER	We're not accepting anymore civilians.
PAM	No, no. I'm Pam Cushing,
PAM	Director of Space Weather for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
PAM	I need to know who's in charge of this facility?
SOLDIER	I think Bill's down in the cafeteria, right? We've been cutoff, Ma'am,
SOLDIER	without communications or a civilian administrator.
SOLDIER	The power's been spotty, and Staff Sgt. Wilkerson has been kind of running things.
PAM	Okay. Thank you, Soldier.
PAM	Please tell your Staff Sgt. To make it to the main entrance with as many soldiers--
SOLDIER	Soldiers? It's just me, him, and a refugees.
PAM	Okay. Fine. As many able-bodied
PAM	recruits as he can lay his hands on in 4 minutes.
PAM	Now!
SOLDIER	Bill, this is Ricky. You'd better get down here.Right now and bring everybody.
SOLDIER	I mean it. Someone's here, and she's pissed.
JOSH	I need 3 or 4 of you guys on the double. You're going to save the world.
JOSH	Bring your stuff with you. We have to keep this place from flooding.
JOSH	You're going to need all hands on deck. If these computers get you water-logged
JOSH	they're not even going to be able to run BASIC.
PAM	What are you gonna do?
JOSH	I have enough diesel over there to get us over to France.
JOSH	But I'm going to have to hitch a ride over to CERN from there.
PAM	Gentlemen,	
PAM	this facility will not flood. It can't. The future of all life on Earth depends on it.
PAM	Do you understand me?
EARL	We need 3 or 4 mean to keep the collider from flooding.
TOM	I'll go, too.
GREG	Uh-uh. Ain't no way I'm going out there.
GREG	Look man, nothing personal. But that's suicide.
GREG	We're talking about building a wall to keep out the Atlantic Ocean.
GREG	And I don't want no part on that.
GREG	What did he say? He needed what, 3 or 4 of y'all, right?
GREG	So I see 1, 2, 3. So...
MARJORIE	4 and a half. [ Spanish ] Vamos mijo.
TOM	Are you sure that's a good idea?
MARJORIE	Getting off the boat is a good idea before I loose my mind.
MARJORIE	So, yes. [ Spanish ] Vamos.
GREG	[ sucks teeth ]
PAM	Alright.
PAM	I got it. Alright. At least I think I got it.
PAM	The underwater cable will provide a grounded line for us to talk once we get to CERN.
JOSH	Okay.
PAM	Are you gonna make it there in that?
JOSH	Yeah. I mean, the ark's got at least 37 days, right?
PAM	[ laughs ]
SOLDIER	Ms. Cushing, Staff Sergeant Wilkerson will be here in a minute.
PAM	Alright. Thank you.
PAM	We have to divide up into teams.
PAM	We got recruits coming from the the boat.
PAM	I want a team commandeering supplies for more sand bags, as well as scaffolding.
PAM	This wall has to be reinforced to a height of at least 60 feet.
PAM	Will that do it?
JOSH	Uh, Yeah. 60 feet should get you over the melt line,
JOSH	provided there's no tectonic disturbance near here.
JOSH	Brookhaven's not on the Ramapo fault. At least it didn't used to be...
JOSH	But I don't want to leave you. Not like this.
PAM	If this works,
PAM	I'll ask you out again.
PAM	[ laughing ]
PAM	Since we don't work together anymore.
JOSH	Take care of her for me. Please.
ROB	Come on, fellas.
ROB	No time like the present to do something with your life.
EARL	We're going to need scaffolds on everyone of these.
EARL	Hey! Make sure they're strong enough to keep the building up.
PAM	The ion cannons here have been designed to run in parallel.
PAM	And that's perfect for what we need, but...
PAM	Normally, you'd just take 2 particles running in opposite directions and
PAM	crash them into each other at a pre-determined point and time in space.
PAM	We need to recalibrate the cannons to fire multiple bursts of particles at ever
PAM 	accelerating rates. Each particle faster than the last.
PAM	So instead of merely colliding two particles into each other at once,
PAM	we collide thousands. Millions.
BROOKHAVEN SCIENTIST	So, to overcome the second law of thermodynamics...
BROOKHAVEN SCIENTIST	We'd create an enduring singularity? 
PAM	Yes.
PAM	And then we kill the power to it. Can we do it?
BROOKHAVEN SCIENTIS	Come on.	
PAM	Whoa.	
PAM	That kid has a future in quantum physics if he keeps up at this rate.
MARJORIE	Yeah. If we live.
PAM	Hey.
PAM	You can't give up hope.
PAM	I don't know if it's God or karma or physical probabilities that result in miracles,
PAM	I don't know if I believe in God or karma,
PAM	I do believe in miracles.
MARJORIE	Let me tell you about your miracles. 
MARJORIE	My sons and I were with my husband on our way to the grocery store,
MARJORIE	when the tsunami hit miles away.
MARJORIE	We were going to shop that's why I didn't pack no water wings...
MARJORIE	[ crying ] nothing.
MARJORIE	I didn't pack nothing.
MARJORIE	This one can tread water for days, but you know, he's clinging.	
MARJORIE	He was holding me so tight, when I came up to the surface, I couldn't see my husband.
MARJORIE	[ crying ] I couldn't see, Pablito. I couldn't see my baby.
PAM	I'm so sorry.
MARJORIE	[ crying ] Don't touch me. 
PAM	He wanted to hold on to you.He didn't know what to do. 
MARJORIE	I didn't know what to do. They still don't know!
MARJORIE	But I know that I can't keep living like this.
PAM	Wow. That's amazing, Ron. How did you do that?
PHIL	What's up, Josh?
PHIL	Hey remind me, It's bow, aft, port, starboard?
JOSH	You got it. You got it.
PHIL	Right on.
PHIL	What's - what's this thing here?
JOSH	This is a MINS navigation system.
JOSH	Helps us get from point A to point B.
PHIL	Awesome.
PHIL	Does it beep? Does it-- How do you know?
PHIL	What's the--
JOSH	It's a combination gyroscopes and accelerometers
JOSH	that enable's the inertial nav system track our exact location on the planet.
JOSH	Irrespective of GPS signals or the Earth's magnetic field. Yeah.
JOSH	You just pick your next destination. 
JOSH	Then this baby keeps you honest in-between. That's why I upgraded the radar array.
PHIL	That is amazing.
JOSH	Yeah. It wasn't cheap either.
JOSH	That's why they don't come standard on boats and planes.
PHIL	Can we make it that far without refueling?
JOSH	If we can keep the wind to our backs we should have just enough diesel to get there.
JOSH	Just.
SOLDIER	Stand clear.
SOLDIER	[ grunt ]
ROB	Ladies and gentlemen,
ROB	I give you OVER 60 feet of sea wall.
ALL	[ cheering ]
SOLDIER	The utility pole!Stand clear!
SOLDIER	Run!
SOLDIER	We're - we're okay.
SOLDIER	We're okay.
TOM	Marjorie!
TOM	[ gasp ]
TOM	[ grunt ]
EARL	Everybody, get on dry ground, now!
EARL	Cut the power!
ROB	Told you not to mess with another man's power.
EARL	Cut the power now!
EARL	We got 3 down and 7 of us are trapped.
PAM	Stay here. Okay, buddy?
RONALDO	Okay.
PAM	Oh no!
PAM	Marjorie?
PAM	Alright.
PAM	What happened?
EARL	Utility pole for the facility came down.
EARL	Conducted the current perfectly.
TOM	Majorie.
TOM	Majorie!
TOM	Easy!
TOM	No, no, no, no!
EARL	Hey buddy. Take it Easy. It's alright.
PAM	You're okay.
PAM	You're okay.
EARL	You alright?
PAM	You guys should go to the control room.
PAM 	Ron's in there. Just don't tell him what happened. I'll tell him when I get back.
EARL	Hold on. Where are you going?
PAM	Our power is out.
EARL	I know. We turned it off when the lines went down.
PAM	Well evidently, most of the connections were fried from the sea water.
PAM	That was our last straw.
PAM	There's a coal and gas burning station at Hempstead.
PAM	One of their main sub-stations is near by. I'm going to try to power it directly
PAM	to the sub-stations so we don't go down there again.
EARL	You're going to hard wire into the collider?
PAM	Yeah.
EARL	Listen,
EARL	I was an electrician in the navy, okay?
EARL	It's been a long time, just but let me do it. Instead of you.
PAM	Are you sure you want to risk it?
EARL	You have a little boy to look after now. 
EARL	Besides, I promised Joshua I'd make sure you'd stay safe.
JOSH	What's going on here?
JOSH	This isn't right.
JOSH	[ grunts ]
JOSH	We're slowing down.
MEL	It's dark in here.
PHIL	Uh, Joshua... What's happening?
JOSH	[ grunts ]
JOSH	We're taking on water.
MOLLY	What are we gonna do? We're sinking!
NICK	We're not sinking. We're taking on water.
MOLLY	That's what sinking is!
JOSH	We've already taken on too much water. The electrical is down and so is the bilge.
JOSH	[ grunts ] Phil,
JOSH	I'm going to need you to oversee getting the water out of here.
PHIL	Uh-huh. Okay.
JOSH	Greg, I'm going to need you to give Phil a hand.
JOSH	I'm going to try to patch it from this side.
JOSH	Greg, I'll go down, I'll start pumping first. Greg-- Whoa!
JOSH	You gotta just make sure you get in and out again, okay?
GREG	Okay.
GREG	[ grunts ]
JOSH	Okay.[ grunt ]	
JOSH	Yea I think right up there wold be good.
JOSH	Alright. I'm gonna get pumping on this side.
GREG	Pump it! Pump it!
PHIL	Are you okay?
TOM	It's not fair. You're taking all the pieces.
TOM	Hey.
TOM	I'll see you later, little man.
TOM	[ whispers ] I didn't tell him anything.
PAM	Thanks.
PAM	Do you know what that shape is called?
RONALDO	A spiral?
PAM	Yeah. When I was little I liked building things a lot too.
PAM	I thought I was going to be an engineer.
PAM	Then my Daddy bought me a telescope and he took me to go look at the stars.
PAM	Do you like looking at the stars?
PAM	Hey, Ron?
PAM	Your mommy was in an accident.
PAM	She's not going to be okay.
PAM	Do you understand?
PAM	She loved you so much, Ron.
RONALDO	[ crying ]
PAM	and she wanted you to be so happy.
PAM	I know this hurts now, but you're going to make her so proud
PAM	with all the wonderful things you will do in your life.  
PAM	Because no matter where she is and no matter where you are,
PAM	she's going to always be right here in your heart.
RONALDO	[ crying ]
PAM	Okay?
RONALDO	[ crying ]
RONALDO	You're crushing me.
PAM	I'm sorry.
RONALDO	That's okay.
RONALDO	[ crying ]
PAM	I'm sorry.
JOSH	That should fix the leak.
JOSH	Mel!
JOSH	Mel! You okay?
JOSH	Whoa!
MOLLY	Looks drier outside.
JOSH	Look guys, I can try to fix the bilge, but we've already taken on so much water...
JOSH	we've gotta try to lighten our load. 
JOSH 	If we don't get rid of some of this stuff-- We've got to try to
JOSH	clear 700 hundred pounds. We're not going to make it.
JOSH	Computer equipment.
JOSH	Personal items.
NICK	There's got to be another way!
PHIL	You want us to throw the food overboard?
JOSH	No, no, no! Look, we've already made it 3,500 miles.
JOSH	We should be able  get there within a day.
MOLLY	If you even know where we're going.
JOSH	This isn't up for vote.
JOSH	If you want to live, start dumping. Come on!
JOSH	We gotta go. Move!
GREG	Nobody's touching the food.
PHIL	Too late.
GREG	Dude, you don't want to do that.
JOSH	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
GREG	Shut up, man!
GREG	Shut up! I'm not doing anything, okay? Nobody touches the food.
JOSH	Okay. Okay. Look. It's my boat. It's my food.
GREG	[ grunt ]
JOSH	[ screams ]
JOSH	[ screaming ]
JOSH	Okay! Okay!
JOSH	You keep--
JOSH	Okay. Okay. You keep the food. You make the call.
MOLLY	Asshole! He save you, and you shoot him?
JOSH	Stop! Stop! Stop!
JOSH	Okay! Okay!
JOSH	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
JOSH	GREG - Greg...
JOSH	Greg's in charge. Do what he says.
NICK	That's crazy! you can't put him in charge!
JOSH	He put himself in charge. I just want to listen to what he says.
JOSH	What do you want to do?
GREG	We're not throwing out the food!	
JOSH	Okay.	
JOSH	I get that. But how do you want to save the boat?
GREG	Alright.[ grunt ]
GREG	Just-- Like what you said.
GREG	Do what you said.
GREG	Alright. Throwing stuff overboard. Just not the food 
JOSH	Okay. Okay.
JOSH	If it isn't-- If it isn't bolted down, pitch it overboard.
JOSH	Take my computer. Take my journals. Everything in this cabin it goes.
MOLLY	Okay this never happened on playground duty.
MOLLY 	We gotta apply pressure or you'll bleed to death.
JOSH	Aah!
JOSH	Everything in this cabin goes! Aah!	
JOSH	Except the food!
GREG	Come on, guys. Let's go.
GREG	Come on guys! Nick, no! Come on!
JOSH	Look, don't wait for me.
JOSH	Go!
JOSH	What's next?
GREG	What about fuel, right?
GREG	We can dump that off.
JOSH	We barely have enough to make there as is.
JOSH	We're caring too much weight.
JOSH	Aah!
PHIL	Here's Pam's things.	You might want that. Excuse me--
JOSH	[ screams ]
GREG	Come on. We gotta do somethingelse. This isn't working.
GREG	MEL!
GREG	Come out of the bathroom, man!
JOSH	Hey! Hey, everybody!
JOSH	Listen. Listen, okay? Listen.
JOSH	We can get through this. But we've got to work together.
JOSH	We need all hands on deck.
JOSH	And I've got only one good arm left.
JOSH	[ scream ]
GREG	What if we just--We keep enough food to make it to dry land.
JOSH	You're in charge.
JOSH	Greg and I are gonna supervise dumping the food.
JOSH	Phil, Nick, you two get gonna have to keep dumping water out of here.
JOSH	Molly, you get whatever's not bolted down overboard.
JOSH	Mel?
JOSH	You just keep doing whatever it is your doing.
GREG	I'm sorry about, you know.
JOSH	Yeah.
EARL	Hey. You got it?
PAM	Alright. It's ready on my end.
PAM	But explain to me how I can hook this up without shorting every circuit in the collider.
EARL	We ran less than 5 miles of Kiwi ASCR, hard-patched into the substation.
EARL	That's over 160 Megawatts with less than 1 OHM of resistance
EARL	coursing through this line right there.
EARL	You've got your juice. [ laughs ]
EARL	Just don't ask me about eminent domain for all the stringing we
EARL	had to do with the flooded backyards, cause I ain't a lawyer.
PAM	[ laughs ] A lawsuit never sounded so good.
EARL	Yeah.
EARL	Hey.
EARL	How's the kid?
PAM	Hey!
PAM	Hey! It's okay.
PAM	Do you want to play with this?
PAM	I probably only have stinky games on there, but--
PAM	Look.
PAM	I don't knowwhat you're feeling or-- I'm useless.
PAM	Maybe if you tell me what's bothering you, I can try to help.
RONALDO	Nobody wants me.
RONALDO	Nobody ever will.
PAM	No.
PAM	No, no, no. That's not true.
PAM	Ron?
PAM	Hey.
PAM	Do you want to come live with me?
PAM	I'd love it if you came to live with me.
PAM	Please?
PAM	[ laughs ]
PAM	Okay?
RONALDO	Okay.
PAM	Okay.
PAM	It's a deal.
RONALDO	Deal.
PAM	[ laughs ]
GREG	Hey! Hey! There's land!
GREG	Hey! Hey, everybody. There's land!
PHIL	Sorry.
MOLLY	Where are we?
JOSH	France?
JOSH	The base of the Alps.
JOSH	Without MINS navigation or a working compass or altimeter,
JOSH	that's all I can say for certain.
GREG	I got this professor.
JOSH	That, and that we're running out of time.
JOSH	Come on.
PHIL	Looks like an old hotel.
MOLLY	Abandoned.
MOLLY	Where do you think Greg went?
JOSH	Beats me.
GREG	We're in a place called La Ravoire.
GREG	I'll drive us once I get this thing started.
GREG	As long as you guys don't mind a little broken glass.
GREG	What's the plan, professor?
JOSH	Get into CERN. No matter what.
JOSH	No matter what?
JOSH	Last time I spoke to CERN's deputy director, Dr. Zicree and I didn't exactly hit it off.
GREG	What? You guys throw-down or something?
JOSH	Or something.
GREG	Well, let's home that the man has a sense of humor.
JOSH	Or amnesia.
MOLLY	How high is 480 meters?
JOSH	That's over 1,600 hundred feet.
JOSH	You should be safe and dry for now.
JOSH	The ground is sinking.
JOSH	When the poles flooded, the sealevel rose by 260 feet.
JOSH	But the fact that, 800 feet of France is out under water means
JOSH	that the Helvetic zone or the eurasian plate is sinking into the mediterranean.
JOSH	Who know when it's going to stop.
JOSH	Or If.
JOSH	We've got to get to CERN.
SOLDIER	[ speaking French ]
GREG	I don't speak French. Does anybody speak French?
SOLDIER	[ speaking French ]
MEL	[ speaking French ]
MEL	[ coughs/sniff ]
GREG	Nice.
MEL	I told them that I don't speak French and that I'm hard of hearing.
JOSH	Excuse me.
JOSH	I'm Doctor Joshua Chamberlain.
SOLDIER	[ guard speaking French ]
JOSH	No no. I'm formerly with the United States
JOSH	Geological Survey I'm here to see Dr. Marc Zicree.
JOSH	The Deputy Director of CERN, Dr.
Marc Zicree.
JOSH	Please. It's urgent.
SOLDIER	You have to leave now.
JOSH	We're not going anywhere until we speak to Deputy Director Zicree. Please.
SOLDIER	[ speaking French ]
JOSH	Doctor Zicree!
GUARD	[ speaking French ]
GREG	They're not playing, professor.
JOSH	I'm not going anywhere until I see the Deputy Director Marc Zicree! Please!
JOSH	Aah!
JOSH	[ screaming ]
SOLDIER	[ speaking French ]
GREG	Easy, Frenchy.
GREG	Easy.
SOLDIER	[ speaking French ]
DR. ZICREE	[ speaking French ]
DR. ZICREE	Dr. Chamberlain.
JOSH	Dr. Zicree, is That you?
DR. ZICREE	[ catching breath ] I'm so sorry.
DR. ZICREE	[ speaking French ]
SOLDIER	[ speaking French ]
JOSH	Serves me right for not learning a second language.
JOSH	Dr. Zicree how did you--?
DR. ZICREE	I was in communications with your-, with Dr. Cushing.
DR. ZICREE	When I saw you on the security screens, thought I should intervene.
JOSH	Just in the nick of time.
DR. ZICREE	Do you need medical attention?
JOSH	No.
DR. ZICREE	Are you alright?
JOSH	Never been better.
SOLDIER	[ speaking French ]
DR. ZICREE	What do you want him todo with your truck?
JOSH	Park it.
DR. ZICREE	[ speaking French ]
DR. ZICREE	Pamela forwarded your settings for increasing the power of ur particle collisions.
DR. ZICREE	Frankly, it's genius, and our theoretical models are predicting at 2,000
DR. ZICREE	to 2 million fold increase in the potentiation of both colliders.
DR. ZICREE	But so far in tests we've been unsuccessful.
JOSH	Have you been assuming a linear collision model?
JOSH	You'll have to use the Fokker--
DR. ZICREE	Planck equation of course.
DR. ZICREE	We're talking about Planck-Energy Level collisions that could
DR. ZICREE	actually reveal super string  theory at the sub-quark level.
DR. ZICREE	Of course.
JOSH	They definitely don't teach that at CSU.
DR. ZICREE	Dr. Chamberlain, I was cavalier and dismissive when you presented your concerns.
DR. ZICREE	I can't apologize those who've lost their lives as a result,
DR. ZICREE	but I can tell you how sorry I am.
JOSH	Thank you, Doctor.
SOLDIER	[ speaking French ]
SOLDIER	[ shouting ]
PAM	Where they explode into each other.
DR. ZICREE	Dr. Cushing. Permission from Dr. Chamberlain.
PAM	I wasn't sure if I was ever going to see you again.
PAM	What happened? Are you okay?
JOSH	You still believe in miracles?
PAM	For once in a blue moon that makes me the genius.
PAM	We lost somebody here,
PAM	but I did find one really special guy.
PAM	Hey Ron, could you say 'hi' to Josh?
PAM	Hey, why don't you go  over by Tom, okay?
PAM	We've secured to a hard-wired 160 Megawatt power source.
PAM	Despite that, we got some difficulty on this end getting the RHIC in working order.
JOSH	It's the non-linear collision operator you need to be assuming.
PAM	That's it.
PAM	You. And then we'll kill the ion cannons to neutralize the singularities.
PAM	It seems almost impossible, doesn't it?
PAM	It's all because of you.
JOSH	Pam, an entire life time wouldn't be enough for me to tell you how much I love you.
DR. ZICREE	And if we hurry we all might getone longer than that. Come.
DR. ZICREE	The magnetosphere at the equator is measuring over 1 microtesla, 
DR. ZICREE	and that reading is falling.
PAM	The Solar Dynamics Observatory feed hasn't been unreliable since the last CME,
PAM 	but the information they have been sending us has been alarming.
DR. ZICREE	Another solar event could decimate our atmosphere.
DR. ZICREE	Maybe now we should initiate the protocol?
JOSH	Dr. Cushing, are you ready?
PAM	Ready, Dr. Chamberlain.
JOSH	Launch the initial proton emissions...
JOSH	Now!
JOSH	When all these numbers go down to zero, all the distance
JOSH	between them is going to collapse in one single point.
JOSH	It's going to be like a crash.
JOSH	Picture to matchbox cars colliding into one another.
JOSH	Only instead of matchbox cars we're using super accelerated protons and instead of just two
JOSH	we're using millions and millions colliding over and over again.
JOSH	But, It's just going to keep happening. You follow me?
PHIL	I always thought matchbox cars were cool.
JOSH	Me too.
DR. ZICREE	Wow.
JOSH	Pam? Pam? Are you seeing this?
PAM	It's a quark-gluon plasma?
DR. ZICREE	We're just witnessing gluons. 
PAM	Oh my--
PAM	[ laughing ]
PAM	We're registering graviton displacement.
EARL / ROB / TOM / RONALDO	[ cheerful laughter ]
PAM	Statistically significant gravity.
PAM	Are you seeing this?
JOSH	Pam. You're already in a singularity.
JOSH	[ laughing ]
JOSH	Okay. We've got one, too. What about the graviton readings?
SCIENTIST	They're increasing. This is astonishing. The two phenomena are feeding
SCIENTIST	each other like magnets. It's the interplanetary gravitational field. 
PAM	I think we've done it.
DR. ZICREE	Look at the screen.
PAM	The magnetic field.
PAM	It's re-engaging.
DR. ZICREE	It's coming back.
JOSH	Okay, Pam.
JOSH	We've got to synchronize and shut-down and neutralize the singularities.
PAM	Understood.
PAM	Can we terminate the ion cannons in parallel with CERN?
BROOKHAVEN SCIENTIST	I believe we can.
SCIENTIST	The gravitational pull is starting to strain our system.
SCIENTIST	The electro-magnetic drain containing our phenomenon
SCIENTIST	has increased over 30% in the last 15 seconds.
SCIENTIST	50% and Climbing!
JOSH	Okay, Pam. In 3. 2. 1.
JOSH	Kill the power.
PAM	Kill the power.
TOM	Whoa.
BROOKHAVEN SCIENTIST	I can't We've overloaded the panel.
PAM	Get everybody out of here.
PAM	Tom, take Ron.
JOSH	The hard wire on the ion cannon. It's fused on?
RONALDO	No!
PAM	Run! Now!
JOSH	Pam?
EARL	Move it! Move it! Go!
JOSH	Pam?
DR. ZICREE	But we've already shut down our electro-magnetic containment.
JOSH	No, no, no, no! Re-engage the containment magnets.
SCIENTIST	It's too late.
DR. ZICREE	Where is it going?
JOSH	Long Island.
JOSH	Only if it hits the outer core first and fuses with the super-heated liquid-iron there.
JOSH	The planet will be destroyed.
PAM	The override!
JOSH	If we're lucky the  two black holes just consume themselves.
DR. ZICREE	If the black hole is still within entropy bounds,
DR. ZICREE	It's theoretical. It could be possible.
PAM	I have to know for sure.
PAM	I know - I know what to do.
JOSH	No, no, no. Pam! Your containment field is not strong enough to hold that singularity.
PAM	 Josh. I love you, Dr. Chamberlain.
JOSH	Run! Now!
JOSH	PAM!
JOSH	[ under breath ] Come on, Pam.
DR. ZICREE	What's the depth now?
SCIENTIST	800 miles but the singularities are increasing in mass, not decreasing.
JOSH	Okay. The mantle there is roughly 1,800 mies thick.
JOSH	That's about how much time we have to stop it.
MOLLY	So, if she can't turn it off?
SCIENTIST	Brookhaven's off-line. Two minutes.
SCIENTIST	1,600 miles.
SCIENTIST	1,650 miles.
PAM	Stand back.
EARL	What the hell are you doing?
PAM	I said stand back!
SCIENTIST	1,700 miles.
SCIENTIST	1,750 miles.
PAM	[ screams ]
RONALDO	Ms. Pam!
SCIENTIST	It's - It's gone.
SCIENTIST	It's gone.
DR. ZICREE	She did it.
DR. ZICREE	Dr. Chamberlain. Your wife saved us.
DR. ZICREE	You saved us!
NICK / PHIL / MEL / MOLLY / GREG	[ cheering ]
SCIENTIST	Yes!
NICK / PHIL / MEL / MOLLY / GREG [ cheering/laughter ]
JOSH	What about- what about, Pam?
JOSH	What about-- What about Brookhaven?
SCIENTIST	There is no signal.
SCIENTIST	It's completely dead.
DR. ZICREE	Ladies and gentlemen, thans to your ingenuity and bravery,
DR. ZICREE	the magnetosphere is once again protecting our planet.
DR. ZICREE	33 microtesla and holding.
DR. ZICREE	Our communications. Our atmosphere.
DR. ZICREE	Our very existence as a species have all been restored.
DR. ZICREE	To Pamela Cushing and Dr. Joshua Chamberlain.
JOSH	Thank you everyone.
DR. ZICREE	To our heroes.
DR. ZICREE	May God protect them.
JOSH	[ sigh ]
JOSH	Pam?
JOSH	Pam, are you alright? Thank God! I couldn't live without you.
JOSH	Pam?
JOSH	Pam, are you crying?
RONALDO	[ crying ]
RONALDO	Mr. Joshua... Ms. Pam, she's.
JOSH	No.
RONALDO	We were supposed to live together, but now...
JOSH	Hey, Ron?
JOSH	She's amazing, isn't she?
JOSH	She told you that.
JOSH	You know,
JOSH	I though she and I were going to live together, too.
JOSH	So since we both thought we'd be with her...
RONALDO	Ms. Pam?
RON	Ms. Pam!
JOSH	What's happening?
EARL	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.
EARL	Easy, easy, easy.
EARL	Oh! It's a miracle you're still alive!
EARL	Relax. Take it easy.
EARL	Breathe.
RONALDO	It's Mr. Joshua.
EARL / ROB / TOM / SOLDIER	[  laughing ]
PAM	Can you stand me now?
JOSH	[ crying ] Absolutely not!
JOSH	And if you ever walked out on me I would never forgive you.
JOSH	Ever! You understand me?
JOSH	Can I come back home?
JOSH	Back to you?
PAM	I'll think my options over. [ laughs ]
JOSH	It's a deal, Dr. Cushing.
JOSH	You got it.
