DONALD	Arresting. Intimate. Honest. There is no intervention here, no commentary. These are the images of a war photographer who understands that the job is not to judge, to comment. But merely to capture truth. 
 
DONALD	War photographers place themselves in harm’s way with no thought of their own safety.  Their job is not to tend to themselves. But to tend to the right of the oppressed, to have their stories told. 
DONALD	I’ve been AVERY	’s editor for  years now, and let me tell you, though that is not always the most enviable job in publishing- 
    
DONALD	AVERY Taggert is the embodiment of the highest journalistic values.  So I am proud to present this award for Photojournalist of the year- .  Let’s please bring her to the stage, AVERY	Taggert
   
AVERY	Sorry, um, I’m not that good at this kind of thing. This is great. I mean, it’s got my, it’s got my name on it and everything. Look, the people who really deserve this, you’ve just seen in all my photos.  
    
AVERY	All I do is take pictures. And, it’s not hard. 
      
DONALD	Let me toast to you. Thank you very much. 
  
AVERY	What are we toasting to?   
 
DONALD	Your award. 
  
AVERY	Oh right. 
  
DONALD	Your incredible, fantastic award. And to many many more just like it. 
  
AVERY	God, I hope not. 
    
DONALD	Is that false modesty bullshit or do you mean it? 
 
AVERY	No, that’s pure self-loathing. And it is far more effective. 
  
DONALD	Yikes. 
  
AVERY	I accept that. Sir, may I please have another one of these? But with, um, twice the alcohol in it. 
  
DONALD	I’ve, uh, I’ve got something I think you might be, let’s just say, interested in, um- 
  
AVERY	Really? 
  
DONALD 	Yeah. One of my guys in Bogota ran into this kid who’s telling everyone who would listen that he’s part of a group that’s going to liberate Columbia- 
  
AVERY	 Okay. 
DONALD 	-change the nation, uh, free the people, all the revolution- 
 
AVERY	That’s a lot! 
 
DONALD 	-bullshit. No. Hey, look at that. Just in time. 
  
AVERY	Just in time for a revolution. Thank you, my friend. 
  
DONALD 	Anyways. He’s met this great man that’s going to lead them all into the jungle and they can become missionaries. 
  
AVERY	Are these missionaries wearing cammies and carrying automatic rifles, by any chance? Yes. 
  
DONALD 	 No. 
 
AVERY	 So, who is this messiah man? 
  
DONALD	All I know is his name is GUILLERMO	. 
  
AVERY	Mmm. GUILLERMO	. 
 
DONALD	GUILLERMO	. Very sexy. 
  
AVERY	Yeah. Sexy man. 

DONALD 	These GUILLERMO types don’t usually like to have a journalist around. But this fella, he’s agreed. AVERY Aah.
   
DONALD 	What do you think of that? 
  
AVERY	I think I know where you’re going with this one. 
  
DONALD 	What, what is this? What the? 
  
AVERY	Oh. 
   
DONALD 	Why would I- 
  
AVERY	What is it? No.
 
DONALD	-have this in my pocket? 
  
AVERY	Oh. It’s a ticket. 
  
DONALD	Why would I? With your name? 
  
AVERY	With my name on it.  
  
DONALD	Yeah. 
  
AVERY	It’s a ticket with my name on it. Leaving tomorrow. 
 
DONALD	Yeah, well, they go to the jungle on Tuesday, so I need you to- Did you have plans?  
 
AVERY	Well, I was planning on being still drunk. 
  
DONALD 	You’re going to Colombia. Have a coffee. It’s the richest kind. How else do you expect to win more of these awards? 
 
AVERY	I didn’t even want the first one. 
  
DONALD 	Ugh. Here we go. I can’t wait to see your negatives on this. I think, uh, I think this GUILLERMO	 sounds incredibly promising. 
  
AVERY	Yeah, sounds like a good man. 
  
DONALD 	 Have a very safe trip. 
  
AVERY	Thank you very much. 
  
DONALD 	Any idea which way the front door is? 
  
AVERY	This way. 
  
DONALD 	Ah. 
  
AVERY	Both of them. 
  
DONALD 	Okay. 
  
AVERY	Yeah. 
  
DONALD 	Good night! 
  
AVERY	Good night Donald, you bastard. 
  
AVERY	It’ll cost you. 
  
MAN 	I’m sorry? 

AVERY	My autograph. It’ll cost you. Well, see, I, I just won this very flash award tonight. I won this. Do you like? 
  
MAN	Yeah. Congratulations. 
  
AVERY	Thank you. I’m thinking of hanging it in the, um, in the bathroom. Right above the toilet. 
  
MAN	(laughs) 
  
AVERY	Would you, uh, like to come see my bathroom?   
   
AVERY	Aah, married. 
  
MAN	Excuse me. 
  
AVERY	Yeah. Good night. Batting a thousand. Yep.    

AVERY	Cheers to me. That was a good one. 
  
DANIEL	Hey. 

AVERY	Toilet. 

AVERY	Ooh. It’s a bit messy. (laughs) 

DANIEL	I’d expect nothing less from the estimable AVERY	Taggert. 

AVERY	Mmm hmm. You can sit here.

AVERY	Um. I wasn’t expecting company.  
  
DANIEL	Not what it looked like downstairs. 

AVERY	Let me rephrase that, um, I wasn’t expecting you. 
 
DANIEL	AVERY Emma Taggert, will you stop? 
  
DANIEL	Relax. Relax, baby. Come here. Hey. Hey. Aren’t you gonna ask what I’m doing here? 
  
AVERY	What are you doing here?  

DANIEL	Well, let’s see. I left you three hundred messages that you haven’t returned. Not to mention the letters and the faxes. Apparently I have to book a flight to have a conversation with my wife. 
  
AVERY	You know how I get when I’m on the move. How things get. 
  
DANIEL	Oh yeah. I know. 
  
AVERY	I have an early flight in the morning. 
  
DANIEL	Come on, no, don’t do this. Don’t. Come here. Don’t do this. Just stop. Just stop. 

AVERY	I’m not doing anything. 
  
DANIEL	That’s what I don’t want you to do. Okay? I don’t want to lose you, Ave. And I know you don’t want to lose me either. Spend tonight with me. 
  
AVERY	No. 
  
DANIEL	Hey. We’ll go, go, go to Carnivale and, and uh we’ll make fun of the costumes and- 
  
AVERY	(laughs) 
  
DANIEL	-we’ll pick up pebbles and we’ll chuck ‘em at the banana. 
  
AVERY	(laughs) Yeah. 
  
DANIEL	You know those big, banana fruit tops? 
  
AVERY	Mmm-hmm. 
  
DANIEL	And you love chucking pebbles at ‘em? 
  
AVERY	Yeah. 
  
DANIEL	And then you always end up hitting them because you have great aim. You always had great aim. Baby. Just tonight, eh? Just one night, yeah? 
  
AVERY	Mmm. (cries) 

SEBASTIAN	Excuse me? Miss AVERY? Can I ask you a question? 

AVERY	Well, (clears throat) you can certainly ask. 
  
SEBASTIAN	Have you, have you ever been to Disneyland? 
  
AVERY	Yeah, once or twice. Actually, three times. 
  
SEBASTIAN	Three times?! No, you’ve been to Disneyland three times? 
  
AVERY	I have, yes. 

SEBASTIAN	Is it, is it magical, like they say? 
  
AVERY	Well, I mean, I guess that depends on your interpretation of magical. 

SEBASTIAN	(chuckles) Yeah, I want to take my brothers and sisters and, and to take them and maybe get one of those, um- 
  
AVERY	The ears? 
  
SEBASTIAN	The ears! Si, si, si, si the ears. 
  
AVERY	How did you get here,SEBASTIAN	? 

SEBASTIAN	Well, I am from a small village, you know, and 

GUILLERMO	brings medicine for the sick and shows us pictures- 
  
AVERY	Mmm-hmm. 
  
SEBASTIAN	-of the city, tells us stories of what it feels like to be free. Hmm. The ears. (chuckles) 

TOMAS	(in Spanish) What kind of food do you miss the most?

LUNA	(in Spanish) Honestly? My mother’s coconut rice. You? 
  
TOMAS	(sighs) (in Spanish)  Hamburgers. Big, nasty, greasy, capitalist hamburgers. LUNASi. Uh huh. Quel rico. 
  
TOMAS	Je voudrais le steak s’il vous plait. 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) You know French? 
  
TOMAS	(in Spanish) I am learning. 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) What for? 
  
TOMAS	(in Spanish) Before we left… you said you wanted to try that new French restaurant. I thought maybe… maybe we could go? Only if you wanted to. 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) Hey Tomas, tie your shoes. 
  
GUILLERMO	Luna, what is our level of supplies? 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish)  grams of penicillin… needles- bandages, ointment, and antibiotics. 
  
GUILLERMO	Okay, okay. Good, good. Next time in English, please for guest. 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) Excuse me. 
  
GUILLERMO	Okay, good, good. Well, in five kilometers, we will reach Alma De Cuero and we will disperse all that. And we’ll stay there the whole night, and the next morning, we’ll cross through the jungle. And we’ll go west. We will reach Pueblo Trinidad, which is just a little dirty town. 
  
GUILLERMO	But a good spot as any to end our journey. And to make a little reunion with Carlos! 
  
GUILLERMO	Well, it’s not Rodin, but it gets the job done. 
 
SEBASTIAN	Puta! 

GUILLERMO	Sebastian,SEBASTIAN	, you are sweet as sugar, but you can’t shoot for shit. Okay, let’s go back through all the steps, so maybe at the end of this journey you can actually hit something. 
  
TOMAS	I doubt it. 
  
GUILLERMO	Shut up, puta, Tomas. (laughs) 
  
GUILLERMO	So, you are looking at the stick man, you are focusing on the stick man. Stop doing that. Okay? You trust in yourself. Line up the front tip on the target and let it float there. 
 
GUILLERMO	And now, line up the front side tip in the rear aperture. Okay? One, two, and three. 
 
GUILLERMO	Just, like shooting a picture, right, Miss Taggert? 
  
AVERY	Sure, yeah. 
  
GUILLERMO	Yeah. So, relax and squeeze. Relax and squeeze. Relax and squeeze. 

GUILLERMO	You know what your problem is, Alejo?  You don’t think before you shoot! (laughs) Maybe that’s the reason you walk into the jungle. Because here you can shoot somebody that you shouldn’t back at home, huh?  
  
GUILLERMO	Or maybe you are just scared of somebody. Your crazy brother, maybe? This world is not big enough for the two of you, eh? (laughs) 
  
GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) (singing) ? I’m ready to believe… that we can fly… I’ll be where I’ll be… and you know where to find me. ? 
  
GUILLERMO	Oh, hey, Miss Taggert! Oh, come here. Let’s take a picture. The two of us. Yes, come on. 
 
AVERY	Okay. 
  
AVERY	(clears throat) 

AVERY	Another one? 
  
GUILLERMO	  (laughs) 
  
AVERY	Sorry. 
   
GUILLERMO	We’ve got a professional photographer with a piece of crap camera! (laughs) How about that? 
 
GUILLERMO	I want to make a toast, so please, uh hold your glasses. 
   
GUILLERMO	We are three days from the end of our journey and I am a man exploding with pride for the things we have done. 
 
GUILLERMO	A great squad is like a living thing with all the parts that keep us breathing.  
 
GUILLERMO	For example,SEBASTIAN, you will be the tender heart. You will face so much evil in your life, and I, and I pray it doesn’t corrupt you. 
  
GUILLERMO	Luna, you will be the conscience. May you never be harmed, or harm anybody else.   
   
GUILLERMO	Tomas, mi hermano pequeno. My flesh and blood. You are the soul of us and I thank you for that. 
  
GUILLERMO	Alejo, Alejo, Alejandro, yeah.  (laughs) You are, you are the hammer we hold. A little crazy, but a good soldier. Yeah, every squad needs a man like you. 
   
GUILLERMO	Marianna. You are a muse. You are inspiration. You show me the way. 
   
GUILLERMO	Um, who am I? Just but a pair of boots to guide you through the mud and the grime and the rain. I’m here just to serve you as you serve the people. 
  
GUILLERMO	When you give them the food and the medicines they need, when you comfort them in their loneliness, when you show them the love and respect the government is not giving to them anymore, because we are missionaries! 
GUILLERMO	So, raise your glasses, please. For justicia! 
  
TOMAS/LUNA/MARIANN/SEBASTIAN/ALEJO	Justicia! 
  
DANIEL	Just tonight, hmm? (breathing) Just one night. 

AVERY	Hello? 
  
GUILLERMO	Oh, oh, I’m, I’m, I’m sorry. I’m, I’m sorry. I didn’t see anything, I promise. Cross my heart. I’m so sorry. 
  
GUILLERMO	I may look like a pervert, uh, but I promise, I’m not. Uh, just relax, it’s just snuff. You want some? 
  
AVERY	No. 
  
GUILLERMO	(laughs) You’re clever. This snuff will kill you, huh? (laughs) You get it? This snuff will kill you? 
  
AVERY	Yeah. 
  
GUILLERMO	(inhales) Yeah. (exhales) You know something funny?  We are uh, at the end of our journey and you have learned so much about me, but I know almost anything about you. 
  
AVERY	Well, then I’m doing my job. 
  
GUILLERMO	(laughs) Yeah! You do your job, yeah. Pretty well. (laughs)  Have you got everything you needed? Photographs and pictures? 
  
AVERY	Well, we’ll find out. (chuckles) 
  
GUILLERMO	This is the first time I let a journalist into our fold. 
  
AVERY	I know, and I really appreciate it. 
  
GUILLERMO	Most of the missionaries, they, they, they, they don’t like journalists. They say they’re here for the truth, but uh, later, they don’t show the truth. They show what the governments want them to show. 
  
AVERY	Well, I’m a woman without government.
 
GUILLERMO	A woman without a government. Yeah, I like it. Yeah. (laughs) 
  
GUILLERMO	You will show the truth, right? 
  
AVERY	The camera sees what it sees. Nothing less, nothing more. 
  
GUILLERMO	Yep, but the camera does not point by itself. A man does it. Uh, a woman. People in Spain, they look down on our brothers and sisters from South America.  Not my case. 
  
GUILLERMO	And that’s why I came here. Uh, when I found my cousin Tomas. Well, I call him a little brother, but he’s actually my cousin. 
AVERY	Yeah. 
  
GUILLERMO	Yeah. When I found my cousin Tomas, uh, I told him, let’s go to the jungle, and show these people who we are. On the inside, you know. 
  
GUILLERMO	These stars have been looking down on this blessed country for the last thousand years, and they will be looking down for the next thousand. And what are we to the stars?  Nothing. A speck.  
  
GUILLERMO	Betancur, he doesn’t cares about the people in this country. His election was a fraud. He’s, he’s working for the drug cartels. They are the ones running the show. Not the government. And we are here to care for these people. We are the government. Is that what your camera sees? 
  
AVERY	I’m just here to take the pictures. 
   
GUILLERMO	The pictures, the pictures, the pictures. You know what? I was an artist. Yeah, um, my father, he took me to an art school. So I made these, uh, how do you call it? Um, abstractions? Um.  
  
GUILLERMO	They didn’t like it. They said I was just making shapes and but as I told them, that, that I paint what I see. Just like you do with your camera. 
 
GUILLERMO	You shoot with your camera. I shoot with my gun. But, uh, what we point them at, that is who we are. 
  
AVERY	Well, I should get some rest. 
  
GUILLERMO	Oh, yes, of course, of course. Yeah. 
  
AVERY	Yeah. 
  
GUILLERMO	Sorry. Yeah. Go get some rest. Go get some rest, and have sweet dreams. Seeker of truth. 
  
AVERY	Night, GUILLERMO. GUILLERMO (in Spanish) Hello! How are you? We are here to protect you! Don’t be scared! Hello! How are you? 
 
GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon! My name is Arturo GUILLERMO	 Dias Rojas. I’m here with the other missionaries to bring medications. 
   
GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) Don’t worry about our weapons, they are merely here for your protection. Who needs medicine? Anyone need medications around here? Is anyone sick? You over there? Speak to the missionaries over there. 
  
MARIANNA	(in Spanish) If you need any help, we’re here for you. 
   
MARIANNA	(in Spanish) Thanks, I don’t need a flower. 
  
TOMAS	(in Spanish) Need some help? What are you trying to do here? 

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) We are missionaries, so you have absolutely nothing to worry about. We are here to bring food, medications, anything you may need.  

GUILLERMO	(speaking in Spanish) (laughs) 

GUILLERMO	 (speaking in Spanish) 
  
GUILLERMO	 (laughs) (speaks in Spanish) 

GUILLERMO	 (screams) (in Spanish) He’s dead! 
  
MARIANNA	(in Spanish) What happened, my love? 
  
GUILLERMO	(in Spanish)SEBASTIAN	, go get the mother! Get the mother! 
  
MARIANNA	(in Spanish) Who did this?   

GUILLERMO	Shh. (in Spanish) The journalist. 
  
MARIANNA	(in Spanish) Why would she do this to him? 
  
GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) Why would she do this to him? Because he saw this! 
  
GUILLERMO	She’s selling drugs in our jungle! 
  
LUNA	Tomas. 

GUILLERMO	This is our fault. She was a tourist and we trusted- I trusted her. And now we have blood on our hands! 
  
MARIANNA	Where is she? 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) No, no wait! Something isn’t right!   
  
MARIANNA 	If GUILLERMO	 says that the journalist killed the boy, then she did. 
  
TOMAS	This is a fortune. 
  
GUILLERMO	Yeah, and that money, that dirty money is for us. But first… Justicia! 

GUILLERMO	(shouting) 

AVERY	(grunts) 
  
AVERY	(shouts) 
  
AVERY	(shouts) 
  
GUILLERMO	(laughs) You got her!   
 
GUILLERMO	Alejo, uh, I know we had our differences in the past, but I love you. I know, I know, I know. But everything I do, I’m doing for the good of you. For the good of all of you, okay? And every time I’m hard on you, it’s because I believe in you. You know that.  
  
GUILLERMO	You are the best soldier here. You’re better than me, even. And I feel we are slowing you down and I don’t want you to not do your best. So go there, and do what you do best.  
  
AVERY	(grunts) AVERY Ooh. Whoa. (sighs)

AVERY	(breathing heavily) 
  
AVERY	(breathing heavily) 
  
AVERY	(grunts) 
  
AVERY	(exhales) 
  
DANIEL	You’re not alone. I’m here with you. I’m right here. I know you can hear me. 

ALEJO 	(in Spanish) Son of a bitch. Now I have to clean the shit out of his ass. 

ALEJO 	(exhales) 
  
ALEJO	(yells) 
  
AVERY	(grunts) 

AVERY	(groans) 
  
ALEJO 	(groans) Fuck! You got the wrong idea, girl! 

AVERY	Unh. 

ALEJO 	(yells) 

AVERY	(gasps) 
  
ALEJO 	(speaking in Spanish) 
  
AVERY	No, no! 
 
AVERY	(screams) 
  
ALEJO 	(coughs) 
 
ALEJO 	(coughs) Time to play. 
  
AVERY	(yells) 
 
AVERY	No, please. Please. 
  
ALEJO 	(coughs) 
 
ALEJO 	Wanna see something? I got this bullet compliment from the CIA. They train me, then they send me to kill, then they try to kill me. Here, right here. 
AVERY	(yells) 

ALEJO 	I’m not done with my story. This one, is from the cartels in Medellin. They make me run some cocaine for them. But they don’t like it when I make my own business. They shoot me in the back. Right here. 
  
ALEJO	Come on, come on. 
  
AVERY	No, no, no! (yells) 
  
ALEJO 	(laughs) Come, come. GUILLERMO thinks he runs the show. But I see what he do. Trying to run some coke in the jungle. My fucking jungle! AVERY	 

ALEJO 	I run the show! Me! The CIA can’t kill me. 
 
ALEJO 	The cartel can’t kill me. 
 
ALEJO 	GUILLERMO can’t kill me. This fucking white bitch can’t kill me! 
 
ALEJO 	Shh. I’m gonna kill you now. Slow and painful. With my knife. Open your beautiful green eyes. 
  
AVERY	(cries) 
  
ALEJO 	Open them! (breathes heavily) Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.  
  
AVERY	Please don’t hurt me. 
 
AVERY	(cries) 
  
ALEJO 	(yells)

ALEJO 	A Kodak moment. This shit doesn’t work. 
  
AVERY	Lens cap. 
  
ALEJO 	Thank you. 
  
ALEJO	Is this how you do it? 
  
AVERY	No.  
 
AVERY	This is how you do it. 

AVERY	(breathing heavily) (grunts) (cries) 

GUILLERMO	Hey, how are you holding up, hijo? Let me ask you a question. Have you seen this thing this boy gave me back at the village? Have you seen this before? 
  
SEBASTIAN	The spiral. Yeah, we speak of it in my village. 
  
GUILLERMO	Yeah, the boy told me that the spiral is like a path you walk, but what is your interpretation? 
  
SEBASTIAN	(speaking in Spanish) Camino, the way. All life is a journey to the center. At the center is truth. 
  
MARIANNA 	GUILLERMO! 
   
MARIANNA	How is this possible? 
  
GUILLERMO	How can a man tame a wild dog? Intellect.  

MARIANNA 	(in Spanish) I’ve got her! 
 
AVERY	(gasps, breathes heavily) 
  
AVERY	(yells) 
  
AVERY	Not now, Daniel, please. 
  
AVERY	Just let me die. 
  
AVERY	You’re putting words in my mouth. That’s not what I said. 
  
AVERY	If I just follow this river. I’ll be in Pueblo Trinidad by morning. I just, I just need to stay ahead of them. 
  
DANIEL	AVERY Emma Taggert. Hiding out, huh? I suppose it’s what you do best. 
  
AVERY	(yells) No! 
 
SANTIAGO 	(speaking in Spanish) 
  
WOMAN 	(speaking in Spanish) 
  
SANTIAGO 	(speaking in Spanish) 
  
WOMAN 	(speaking in Spanish) 
  
SANTIAGO 	(speaking in Spanish) 
  
WOMAN 	(speaking in Spanish) 
  
SANTIAGO 	(speaking in Spanish)  

AVERY	Hello. 
 
GOMEZ 	(in Spanish) What the fuck is this? 
  
AVERY	(in Spanish) Let them up. Let them up. 
  
AVERY	Let her go. 

GOMEZ 	(in Spanish) Get up, get up. 
  
AVERY	(in Spanish) Be a gentleman… Help her up. 
  
SANTIAGO 	(in Spanish) Fuck that bitch, she has legs. 
  
AVERY	(in Spanish) Help her up! 
  
AVERY	(in Spanish) Snow in Colombia.  
  
AVERY	Fucking GUILLERMO. Tell me, does the boss man know you’re snorting all his merchandise?  
  
AVERY	Huh? Let her go.  
  
AVERY	You let them go, I let you go, we all live. You don’t let them go, I hold this fucking trigger down and we all die. (in Spanish) Understand? Muertos. 
  
AVERY	No! 

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER	(whimpering) 
  
GOMEZ 	(coughing and choking) 

LUNA	(in Spanish) He is lying. 
  
TOMAS	(in Spanish) He is my family. He is a great man. 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) Why would the journalist kill the boy? 
  
TOMAS	(in Spanish) He said. The boy saw her selling drugs. 
 
LUNA	(in Spanish) Think about it, Tomas. Who is more likely to be selling cocaine here? Some acclaimed foreign journalist?  Or a crazy Spaniard who volunteers to live in the Colombian jungle with a squad of armed soldiers? 
  
MARIANNA  	(in Spanish) You should be more careful. A bad apple spoils the bushel. No? 

MARIANNA 	(in Spanish) Betancur’s soldiers. 
  
GUILLERMO	Si. 
  
SEBASTIAN	(in Spanish) From the photographer? 
  
GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) The journalist. 
  
GUILLERMO	The jungle’s got to her and she’s crazy now. And if we are not careful, she will kill us next. 
  
MARIANNA 	She went there. 
  
GUILLERMO	So we go there. (singing) ? Little duck, little duck. Coffee brown, why are you so sad? I’d like to know. I lost my lady duck and that’s why I’m sad. I saw your lady duck, she was sitting on a nest very far from here… ? 
  
DANIEL	How are you gonna come back from something like this? There’s blood on your hands now. Why are you pretending I’m not here? 
  
AVERY	I don’t have to pretend. You’re not. 
 
AVERY	Stay right there,SEBASTIAN! 
  
SEBASTIAN	I have no weapons.  
  
AVERY	Where are the others? 
  
SEBASTIAN	I’m alone, Miss AVERY	. 
  
AVERY	Bullshit. 
  
SEBASTIAN	No. Look, GUILLERMO knows that there’s been a mistake. He, he wants to make peace. 
  
AVERY	GUILLERMO is a psychopath. 
  
SEBASTIAN	No, Miss AVERY, you have it wrong. He’s good.  
  
AVERY	 He has you confused,SEBASTIAN	.  
  
SEBASTIAN	If you, you’d seen the things that I’ve seen this man do, you’d know he’s a good man. 
  
AVERY	I have seen. He killed that boy.  
  
SEBASTIAN	No. 
  
AVERY	He will kill you. 
  
SEBASTIAN	No, no. 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) He’s going to get killed. 
  
TOMAS	(in Spanish) She won’t shoot him. 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) I’m not worried about her, Tomas. 
  
SEBASTIAN	Look, Miss AVERY, if you just please trust me and let me talk to you. Okay, we can fix this. 
  
AVERY	Come closer. 
 
AVERY	Closer. 
  
AVERY	Where are they? 
  
SEBASTIAN	Miss AVERY	- 
  
AVERY	Where are they,SEBASTIAN ? 
  
SEBASTIAN	I’m alone.  Look, he just wants to make peace.  
  
AVERY	(murmurs) 
  
SEBASTIAN	He just- 
  
AVERY	GUILLERMO! 
  
SEBASTIAN	I swear, he just wants to make peace. 
  
AVERY	It’s not.  
  
SEBASTIAN	GUILLERMO! GUILLERMO, tell her! Miss AVERY, please. 
  
AVERY	Come on. GUILLERMO, tell him. 
  
SEBASTIAN	He’s not going to shoot, I promise. 
  
GUILLERMO	Fuck you! 

GUILLERMO	Oh my God, she had a knife, she had a knife! Go get her! 
  
AVERY	Sebastian! 
  
SEBASTIAN	(gasping for air)
    
MARIANNA 	(speaking in Spanish) 
  
SEBASTIAN	(breathing heavily) 
  
GUILLERMO	Sebastian! SEBASTIAN. Oh,SEBASTIAN. My beating heart.SEBASTIAN. (speaks Spanish) 
  
GUILLERMO	 (speaking in Spanish) 
  
GUILLERMO	Can you see it? 
  
SEBASTIAN	(breathing heavily) 
  
GUILLERMO	Can you see it? The spiral? Can you see the spiral now? Now you understand, right? Let me help you. 
  
SEBASTIAN	(labored breathing) 
  
SEBASTIAN	GUILLERMO! 
 
LUNA	Tomas! (breathing heavily) Shh.  
  
GUILLERMO	Can you see it? Can you see it now? 
  
LUNA	(in Spanish) I’m sorry, Tomas. 
  
TOMAS	(in Spanish) Let’s go! 
  
GUILLERMO	 Hey! Luna, I can expect this from you, but Tomas, mi hermano pequeno. 

LUNA	 (in Spanish) Let us go, GUILLERMO	! 

GUILLERMO	No! In English.  

TOMAS	We’re leaving. This is not our fight.  

GUILLERMO	Not your fight? Right now, you are breaking my heart in two. How you do this to your brother?  

TOMAS	We are not brothers.  

GUILLERMO	We are brothers!  

LUNA	(in Spanish) Back off GUILLERMO! 

TOMAS	(speaking in Spanish)  

GUILLERMO	(laughing) You are not going anywhere, brother. Just we’re going, brother.  

GUILLERMO	Okay, I uh- I don’t understand this situation at all!  You choose her over me. Do you know why I came to this land at all? For my own health?   

GUILLERMO	I came here for you, my brother, my flesh and blood. And now you want to kill your own brother? For her? For love? Well, I can understand that. But I am the one who’s going to die for love here. So take this blade, let me die with the same knife I gave to you!  

LUNA	(yelling in Spanish) 

GUILLERMO	(yells)  

TOMAS	(in Spanish) Go! Go!  

LUNA	(crying)  

TOMAS	(in Spanish) Go!  

LUNA	(in Spanish) Please, let’s go!  

TOMAS	(in Spanish) Go!  

LUNA	Tomas! (groaning) (in Spanish) Come with me, Tomas! Tomas! Come with me! 

TOMAS	(in Spanish) Go! Please! Go! Please Luna, go!  

GUILLERMO	 Don’t make me do something that I don’t want to, brother.  

GUILLERMO	 You will not leave me. You will never leave me. You see? Did you see? Did you see it? Did you see it?  

GUILLERMO	 Luna! Luna! Luna!   

AVERY	Please.  
MARIANNA 	(spits) (in Spanish) Fucking whore! 

AVERY	I was innocent! (yells)  

MARIANNA	I don’t care!

AVERY	You know there are others, right?  

MARIANNA	What did you say, puta?  

AVERY	GUILLERMO. You don’t possibly think you’re the only one?  

MARIANNA 	(in Spanish) You’re lying! 

AVERY	What about the girl in Carta Bianca? You saw how he was looking at her. He wanted her.  

MARIANNA 	You’re a puta! (in Spanish) You’re asking to die. 

AVERY	Yeah, there was- yeah, (laughs) there was definitely a girl in Mojado. (laughs) Yeah, she was pretty.  

MARIANNA 	No!  

AVERY	Young. Mm-hmm. A piece of ass in Graviota. Piece of ass in Ticuna.  

MARIANNA 	He loves only me!  

AVERY	There’s one I know for sure. You know why? It was me.  

MARIANNA 	No! 

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) Shit! 

MARIANNA  	GUILLERMO. Mi amor.  

AVERY	(shouts) (heavy breathing)  

LUNA	(heavy breathing) (in Spanish) I know you’re innocent.  

AVERY	Last time I heard that story, I got shot.  

LUNA	(in Spanish) Then I’m going to have to kill you!  

GUILLERMO	(breathing heavily) (crying) Marianna. 

GUILLERMO	No! No!  

AVERY	They’re coming. They’re coming.   

LUNA	(yells)  

AVERY	Sorry. Okay. Down.   

AVERY	Okay. (grunts) (breathes heavily) Thank you. 

LUNA	(cries) I know him since we are children. Following me around everywhere. With that crooked little smile. (laughs)  

LUNA	Every time I looked back, there is Tomas. (cries) I never got to tell him. I never got to tell him.   

AVERY	(cries)   

AVERY	I lost my husband, Daniel.  

LUNA	I’m sorry. Was it long ago?  

AVERY	Yeah, we were separated at the time. I hadn’t spoken to him,  fuck, I hadn’t spoken to him for months. (breathes heavily) He surprised me one time, in Rio. (groans)   

AVERY	Ah, he used to do that sort of thing all the time. Just show up wherever in the world I was for work. He caught me on a good night. He took me out. We went to the Carnivale. I had just- I just got my camera. It was brand new and I took a lot of photos.   
AVERY	I took a whole roll that night. I never got it developed, but I can remember every frame I took. This- this is the last time I saw him.  

LUNA	You need fresh water.  

AVERY	Uh, yeah.  

LUNA	I hear a stream. I will fill my canteen. (groans)   

AVERY	(breathes heavily) Thank you.  

LUNA	Back in a flash.  

AVERY	(laughs) Thank you. Back in a flash. (exhales) 

AVERY	(breathing heavily) (moans)  

GUILLERMO	Hello, Miss Taggert! La periodista! Don’t worry, Luna, I found her. I found your lady duck. (laughs) (speaks in Spanish)  

GUILLERMO	Let me tell you something about this guy you stand in judgment of. 

GUILLERMO	AVERY!   

GUILLERMO	AVERY!   

GUILLERMO	Do you know what’s at the bottom of the spiral? Because you’re almost there. (laughs) Me, too, maybe.  

GUILLERMO	So, you see El Guero selling this big bag of cocaine. And later you see El Guero slicing the throat of this little kid and, and- you take pictures.  

GUILLERMO	And this sounds like a Pulitzer Prize, ladies and gentleman.  

GUILLERMO	Well, Miss Taggert, I’m a leader. I’m a missionary. I change lives.  

GUILLERMO	There was this little boy in the village of Nazareth. And he was pretty sick. Yellow fever. A nasty thing. And they couldn’t fix him.   

GUILLERMO	And I realize this boy can’t stop loving my watch. And you know what I did? I gave it to him. And I see his face shining so bright. And I think to myself, well, I did something right. 

GUILLERMO	Two weeks later, I am back in Nazareth and the boy is fully recovered! They say it’s because of me and my watch. The watch made the boy become well.  

GUILLERMO	Well, what does this story tell you, Miss Taggert? This boy, I save his life. This other boy, I take it away. But coming from me, all things are the same gift.  

GUILLERMO	I can tell you what the spiral means. The spiral is death. You push yourself as far as you can go. Not fearing death. Chasing it. And at the very end, at that single, intimate, solitary moment, you know yourself. For real.  

GUILLERMO	I envy you, Miss Taggert. You are so close. That Juan. You think I did something evil to him? I didn’t do anything evil to Juan. Or, or Luna. OrSEBASTIAN	! Or Tomas! I gave them the same gift that I’m about to give to you!  

GUILLERMO	Miss Taggert! Miss Taggert! Where are you? Show yourself!  Show yourself!   

AVERY	(panting, groaning) (breathing heavily) 

CARLOS 	(in Spanish) Journalist? Where is your squad? Gringa?   

CARLOS  	(in Spanish) Answer me when I’m talking to you! Do you know who I am?  

AVERY	Alejo. You’re a ghost.  

CARLOS 	(in Spanish) What?  

AVERY	I killed you. (gasps) You’re dead. They’re all dead.   

CARLOS 	Where is the fucking squad?  


AVERY	(grunts)  

CARLOS 	You know who I am?  

AVERY	You’re the brother.   

CARLOS 	No. no.  (in Spanish) I am his shadow. His anger.   

AVERY	(yells) (grunts)  

CARLOS 	(in Spanish) I am hurt. Here.   

AVERY	(yells)    

AVERY	(gasps)  

GUILLERMO	Now you see, Miss Taggert? It’s that simple. Relax and squeeze. Relax and squeeze. Relax and squeeze.  

GUILLERMO	Seems like when it comes to killing this family, we have become a good team.  

AVERY	(breathing heavily)  

GUILLERMO	Where are the photographs?  Where are the photographs? Come on, where are they?  

AVERY	(yells) (grunts)  No! (breathes heavily) 

GUILLERMO	 (laughs)   

AVERY	Don’t. No, please. (groans) No.  

GUILLERMO	So much for the Pulitzer Prize. Miss Taggert. 

AVERY	 (groans)  

GUILLERMO	 Adios. 

GUILLERMO	 (in Spanish) Good morning sir, how are you doing? 

GUILLERMO	 Hola. Hola.  

BOY 	Hola. Hola. 

GUILLERMO	Hey. (in Spanish) Good morning, friend! El Guero has come! (laughs)  

GUILLERMO	Hey! (in Spanish) Good morning! It’s El Guero!   

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) Good morning sir! Do you remember me? Remember me?  

GUILLERMO	 (in Spanish) Good morning! My name is Arturo 

GUILLERMO	 Dias Rojas! But you probably know me as El Guero! I come to you on this day as your servant, a member of the Fuerzas Especiales. We fight for you when your government fights against you!  

GUILLERMO	(in Spanish) When they write the history books they will say that we were heroes. Yes. All of us. The people! We fight for freedom! We fight for truth! We fight for justice!  

NEWSCASTER	(in Spanish) A terrible atrocity was committed in the jungles outside of the small village of Alma de Cuero. GUILLERMO Dias Rojas, the selfproclaimed leader of the guerilla organization Armadas Especiales, was photographed brutally executing a child for reasons unknown.  

NEWSCASTER	(in Spanish) Authorities are unclear on exactly where and when this photograph was taken, as it was delivered anonymously to our local news office.  

NEWSCASTER	(in Spanish) We don’t know the name or age of the boy who was from Alma De Cuero and one photograph depicts two soldiers exchanging drugs with Dias Rojas.  

NEWSCASTER	(in Spanish) Police are presently in the village taking statements from villagers…  

NEWSCASTER	(in Spanish) Dias Rojas is a Spaniard wanted in his home country for numerous crimes-  

GUILLERMO	(gasps) (coughs) 

NEWSCASTER	(in Spanish) -including counterfeit, tax evasion and blackmail, as well as numerous counts of assault.  

NEWSCASTER	(in Spanish) Descended from a wealthy family, Dias Rojas used his considerable personal means to flee Spain and has believed to be hiding out in Colombia under an assumed identity of a missionary, or freedom fighter.  

NEWSCASTER	(in Spanish) Authorities warn that Dias Rojas is extremely dangerous and any sightings should be reported to local authorities immediately.  

GUILLERMO	(breathes heavily) (in Spanish) I see. I see. (coughs, spits up blood) I see. 

GUILLERMO	(cries) 	  

AVERY	(cries)  

DONALD 	So. You’re sure? I don’t mean about the nut, I mean about all of this. You’re really sure?  

AVERY	I am really really sure.  

DONALD 	You’re really sure?  

AVERY	Donald, I am really really certain.  

DONALD 	Contender for Pulitzer Prize.  

AVERY	Look, if I win it, you can hang it in your bathroom.  

DONALD 	That’s terrific.  

AVERY	Yeah.  

DONALD 	(exhales) What the hell are you even gonna do? What do you do when you’re not working? That’s what I want to know.   

AVERY	(exhales) Well, I bought a new car. And I figure I’ll do some driving. Check out this fair nation of yours. And not take a single, solitary photo. That’s the plan.  DONALD  Well, it sounds like a wonderful life.  

AVERY	Does to me. (laughs)  

DONALD 	Good luck.  

AVERY	Thank you, Donald.  

DONALD 	Need some help lifting that purse?  

AVERY	Adios.    

DONALD 	And AVERY? Just remember there’s an awful lot of work here when you’re ready.  

AVERY	That might be a while, Donald. Go easy on those nuts.
