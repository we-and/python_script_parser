MAN	Previously on "The Quad"...

TRINA	When did she leave town?

WOMAN	Leave her alone.

TRINA	She's the face of sexual assault on this campus. The protest isn't as effective if the victim isn't actually here.

CEDRIC	Did somebody come at you about that shoot in the club? My girl was killed. I really can't hear she in a better place.

CECIL	What in the hell did you do? That music was about my damn life!

DANNY	I swear I did not give it to them.

CECIL	Get out!

MAN	One, two, three.

WOMAN	Pupils look good.

WOMAN	Get this set up.

CECIL	Everywhere I go, I gotta hear about my son playing his sax, playing his piano, writing his music.

MAN	Here you go.

WOMAN	Thank you.

MAN	No problem.

CECIL	Uh-huh. Told you there's only one musician in this house, boy.

MAN	Blood pressure's rising.

MAN	Got an arrhythmia.

MAN	Heartbeat is irregular.

ELLA	Our best evidence is that a woman discovered the science of agriculture, which led to the creation of permanent settlements, as opposed to the transitory hunter-gathered communities of the past. Unfortunately, this woman, this important pioneer's name has been lost to history. But that's just fine with you, huh, Junior?

JUNIOR	Absolutely not.

ELLA	Mm-hmm. Then why you back here playing little boy games instead of listening to the lecture like a serious student should be?

JUNIOR	Dr. Caldwell, I have way too much--

ELLA	Be quiet, Junior. History is an echo of culture. What do I mean by that, Madison?

MADISON	Oh, um...well, culture is really just the accumulated knowledge of humankind, so I guess you're calling that accumulation an echo. Taking a more literary, metaphorical look at it.

ELLA	Thank you for a very thoughtful answer. Which takes us to our next assignment: an experiment.

KIARA	Um, Professor Caldwell, our next assignment isn't due for two weeks.

ELLA	As of today, that syllabus is outdated and you will have a new one tomorrow with the new assignment inspired by BoJohn, Junior, and Madison, and anyone else who wants to disrespect my class by being on the phone while you're sitting there. All of you, working in groups, will introduce a new piece of information into the culture of Georgia A&M.

BOJOHN	How are we supposed to do that?

ELLA	You tell me. It has to highlight a gender difference and...your groups have to have both men and women.

KIARA	Do they have to be from this class?

ELLA	It's up to you. No less than ten pages for your findings. Have fun.

JUNIOR	Ten pages, bro?

WOMAN	I'll do one. You do nine.

EVA	Come in.

CHRYSTAL	Ma'am, Mr. Briggs is here.

DOMINIQUE	Chrystal, how are we ever gonna be friends if you don't call me Dom?

CHRYSTAL	Oh. Okay. [laughs] Fair enough.

EVA	Thank you, Chrystal.

CHRYSTAL	Yes, ma'am.

DOMINIQUE	Morning, Eva.

EVA	Dominique. So what brings you here?

DOMINIQUE	You say that like you're not happy to see me. I can leave if you want me to.

EVA	You made an appointment to see me. My assumption is you have business to discuss, so I', merely--

DOMINIQUE	Telling me to get to it. Chop, chop. I can run with that. I am here on business and I'm here to make good on a promise.

EVA	Oh, please tell me it's about money and what we need to do to get it.

DOMINIQUE	I put together a donor group. The right folks, too, deep, deep pocks.

EVA	What's the catch?

DOMINIQUE	GAMU has a history of financial irregularities. The donors want an audit of the books before they move forward.

EVA	Not a problem. Long overdue.

DOMINIQUE	Okay, great. Let's celebrate. I'm thinking dinner...on you.

EVA	(laughs) Deliver and we'll celebrate.

DOMINIQUE	(laughs) You pull a punch every once in a while, woman. Damn.

EVA	I do owe you a proper thank you. I wouldn't even be at the table if you didn't care so much for your alma mater. Why not...join me for dinner?

DOMINIQUE	So dinner on you?

EVA	Dinner on me.

DOMINIQUE	All right. Pleasure, as always. You like what you see, don't you?

EVA	(laughs)

TIESHA	I wish they had healthier snacks in this vending machine. All this sugar? I've been trying to cut back, but you know how that goes.

BOJOHN	Hey, Tiesha. Can we talk to you for a second?

TIESHA	I'll be right back. Why y'all creeping around like two rich kids trying to find the weed man?

BOJOHN	We need to ask you something. This may sound crazy...um...

JUNIOR	Just ask her.

BOJOHN	We have this thing. And, um, we need your help...

JUNIOR	You wanna be in a threesome with us?

TIESHA	What? Hell naw!

BOJOHN	It's not how Junior just made it sound. We just need people to think the three of us are smashing.

TIESHA	Ain't nobody gon' believe that either one of y'all can get with me.

JUNIOR	Exactly. So no big deal, right?

BOJOHN	It's a class project. We're looking at the difference between how people treat girls versus how they treat guys when they behave outside sexual norms.

TIESHA	Everybody knows men and women are not treated the same. Where'd y'all get this ridiculous-ass idea?

BOJOHN	From a documentary on Netflix.

TIESHA	Y'all are stupid. This project is stupid. And no.

BOJOHN	No? Come on, now. We'd do it for you.

TIESHA	But what do I get out of this stupidity?

JUNIOR	Every starter on the team.

TIESHA AND BOJOHN	What?

JUNIOR	Interviews for your blog.

TIESHA	You for real on that.

JUNIOR	Dead ass.

TIESHA	Okay. Cool. But don't play with me. Those interviews, they better come.

BOJOHN	Yeah.

JUNIOR	You got it. Thanks, Tiesha.

BOJOHN	Thank you. Nice going.

JUNIOR	Yeah!

BOJOHN	How'd you think of that?

BRYCE	Where's my damn remote? Ced. Cedric!

CEDRIC	What?

BRYCE	You seen the remote?

CEDRIC	Nah.

BRYCE	You had it last. See, if you just put it back where you got it from, we wouldn't have this problem.


BRYCE	What the hell?

CEDRIC	What's good, bro? What up, Dre? This is Chantel's brother. This is my roommate, Bryce.

DRE	What up?

BRYCE	Everything's good.

DRE	Uh, can I holler at you in private?

BRYCE	You guys stay put. I'm gonna go get something to eat.

CEDRIC	All right.

DRE	(sighs) The streets been talking, bro. But wasn't nothing I was gonna say on the phone.

CEDRIC	What's going on?

DRE	I know who killed me sister.

CEDRIC	What? The hell is you talking about?

DRE	He go by Bones. Do security from some whack-ass rapper named Raw Thug, opened up for Jay Rav. I guess she must have known he was looking for her about that shooting. So she broke out, came to visit you.

CEDRIC	Bones. Chantel told me she saw the shooter. That must be who she talkin' 'bout. I asked her if something was up and she said that it wasn't.

DRE	She didn't tell me either, bro.

CEDRIC	She disappeared at Rav's concert. The little bitch must have been there too. I thought if she kept her mouth shut...this whole thing is my fault.

DRE	Naw, man, it's his fault. His fault. It ain't your fault, all right? Look. Raw Thug, he got his own gig out here.

CEDRIC	Bones gon' be with him?

DRE	Yep. And I know how to get his smoked-out ass to a spot.

CEDRIC	So what you tryna do?

DRE	You strapped?

CEDRIC	Nah.

DRE	Hey, man, you gon' take this or what? I thought so. I'ma hit you as soon as I set it up, all right?

CECIL	Hey, sis.

CYNTHIA	In a lot of pain, huh?

CECIL	Not at all.

CYNTHIA	Liar.

CECIL	Why'd you do it, Cynthia? Why'd you bring your father to my show?

CYNTHIA	He's our father. And you said the song was about our family. And I don't know why it matters since the band didn't even perform the song.
CECIL	The name of the song is "My Sister's Blues." It's about us. What we went through. And the reason we didn't perform it is because that bastard Clive Taylor stole it. And I'll deal with that thief when I get out of here.

CYNTHIA	Didn't know you lived in such a cut-throat world.

CECIL	Oh, yeah. But I'm usually not the one getting cut. Anyway, back to your father. When'd you guys reunite?

CYNTHIA	When he got sick. I was the only relative they found. Suddenly, he was my responsibility.

CECIL	Didn't have to be.

CYNTHIA	You weren't gonna do it.

CECIL	Take care of the man that beat us like he owned us? Damn skippy it wasn't gon' be me.

CYNTHIA	You want to talk about the past? Let's talk about all of it. Like how you left the minute the music scholarships came in. You packed you bags and you got out. But me and mama, we were still there. Two punching bags and no one to block the hits.

CECIL	Do you think my pain stopped when I left for school? I still can't sleep through the night. You and mama screaming and begging him to stop. That's what I still here.  years after I walked out that door and that's what I still hear and I can't take nothing for it. I need my mind for music.

BETTYE	Hello. Time to get up and do a little run around the block, Mr. Diamond. (laughs) Oh, come on. It won't be that bad.

JABARI	Future Lawyers Club?

BRYCE	Ah, right here. Bryce Richardson. Have a seat. I was just telling everybody about an opportunity to intern with the Innocence Project of Atlanta. So if you all just wanna look over the forms...

TIESHA	What time y'all coming through?

BOJOHN	Come any time you want, babe.

JUNIOR	And as many times as you want. Hey!

BOJOHN	Ah!

TIESHA	Boy, bye. You need to get your stroke game up.

JUNIOR	What you mean?

TIESHA	You faster than a replay.

JUNIOR	That's not the story we practiced.

BOJOHN	She's improvising. GO with it.

JUNIOR	Okay. Well. Next time I'm hitting it, call me Dark Daddy.

BOJOHN	Yeah, no. Back to the script. Back to the script.

TIESHA	How do you feel about me recording us next time it's your night?

BOJOHN	What? No. Why?

TIESHA	'Cause you need to watch some game film. I'm getting bored.

BOJOHN	Okay. Gotta go meet with Coach. I'm out.

COACH HARDWICK	Okay, who's blitzing?

TERRENCE	The mike and the weak outside linebacker.

BOJOHN	No, the mike, nickel, and strong safety.

COACH HARDWICK	That's right. The QB made the same mistake as you did, Terrence. Now if you'd have read it right, he would have scored instead of getting the back crushed. Now let's try it again. Who's coming, Terrence?

TERRENCE	I don't know. Strong safety?

COACH HARDWICK	BoJohn?

BOJOHN	All the linebackers.

COACH HARDWICK	Correct. QB gets crushed. Easily could've fumbled. This team blitzes % of the time and they disguise until right before the snap. If you don't recognize your keys, you'll get killed out there.

TERRENCE	I'll be all right, Coach. Teacher's pet here is the one who sack fumbles, not me.

COACH HARDWICK	A good football player doesn't cover his ass with somebody else's.

CEDRIC	(sighs)

CHRYSTAL	Oh, your : is here. Did you--do you want me to take notes in this meeting? I feel like I should take notes.

EVA	Why?

CHRYSTAL	Because...sometimes your head is down in everything that's on your plate and you don't see the need for backup.

EVA	We'll take the meeting in the conference room.

CEDRIC	What the hell you is doin' in my stuff?

BRYCE	You bring a damn gun into our room and have the nerve to be mad at me?

CEDRIC	This really ain't none of your business.

BRYCE	I hope that locked-up life was good, see, because that's where you're headed with that shit.


CEDRIC	Like I said, this really ain't none of your business.

BRYCE	You made it my business.

CEDRIC	Really can't do this with you right now.

BRYCE	Stupid.

CHRYSTAL	Dr. Fletcher, this is Trina and Maya. They're with "I Didn't Consent."

EVA	Nice to meet you, ladies.

TRINA AND MAYA	Nice to meet you too, Dr. Fletcher.

EVA 	Shall we sit?

TRINA	We were hoping to speak with you alone.

EVA	Oh, you can trust Chrystal. Please. Let's sit. You asked to see me, so this is your meeting. But I have to say, the support you offer assault victims is commendable. I know you reached out to my daughter and I cannot thank you enough for that.

TRINA	Of course. It's what we're about.

EVA	So what can I do for you?

TRINA	(exhales) Go on. Speak your truth.

MAYA	Terrence raped me too.

EVA	(sighs)

THURGOOD	Come on out some time. The clubhouse has been renovated. And the bar--cool drinks from hot girls.

CECI	Mm, well, you know I won't pass up an opportunity to drink with the finest president Georgia A&M has ever known.

CARLTON	Make that two of us.THURGOOD	I see that my successor stays in the news.

CARLTON	So does every disaster.

THURGOOD	Mm-hmm.

CARLTON	Now she's courting this strip club owner, trying to get his dirty money into GAMU. Tried to tell the Search Committee she wasn't the one.

CECIL	Came with a damn impressive resume, though. (coughs)

THURGOOD	Yeah. Easy on the eyes too.

CECIL	Oh, she fine.

THURGOOD	Yeah.

CARLTON	Not my type.

CECIL	Well, fine is everybody's type.

CECIL	(coughing)

THURGOOD	Let's get on outta here, Carlton. Let the man get some rest, huh?

CECIL	Oh, no, I'm all right. I'm all right. It's the damn recycled hospital air.

THURGOOD	Yeah, yeah.

CECIL	Good to see you, Dr. Bradford.

THURGOOD	Yeah, and you, Mr. Director.

CECIL	Oh, yeah.

CARLTON	Boom.

CECIL	Hey!

CARLTON	Hey!

CECIL	Behave.

THURGOOD	You take care.

THURGOOD	I'm getting questions, Carlton. Hard questions. You told me if I stepped down, that would be the end of it.

CARLTON	And you told me the president position was mine.

THURGOOD	No, that's not my fault. Every time you take a sit-down nowadays, there's a new regulation. There had to be a search and once that search committee came on--

CARLTON	Understood, but as long as--

THURGOOD	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Your hands are tied. Never thought my retirement would come five years before I was ready to go. Spending my days looking over my shoulder. You know, ain't nobody even called me to teach a freshman honor's course.

CARLTON	Right about now, honestly, you might want to make travel plans.

EVA	Hello. I'm sorry. You okay?

SYDNEY	You scared me. Dad didn't tell me you were coming.

EVA	I wanted to surprise you. Maybe not the best idea.

SYDNEY	No, no. Sit.

EVA	Did you eat at all today?

SYDNEY	Are you gonna sit?

EVA	Of course, sweetie. I'm sorry.

SYDNEY	Thank you.

EVA	There's something you need to know and I want you to hear it from me. Another girl came forward. Terrence raped her too.

SYDNEY	Are you serious? How'd you find out? Who told you?

EVA	She did. I told her how sorry I am and that we are going to get him the hell off of that campus. But, unfortunately, it's, uh...it's gonna take time.

SYDNEY	What's her name?

EVA	I can't tell you that.

SYDNEY	Why? What is her name? Oh, my God.

EVA	She hasn't gone public, but she knows she wants to. The president of "I Didn't Consent"--

SYDNEY	Trina.

EVA	Yes. She brought her in.

SYDNEY	I'm going back.

EVA	What? No. No. You need to stay far away from that piece of shit.

SYDNEY	Another girl came forward. If we go to the police together, maybe they'll get off their asses and arrest him.

EVA	Honey, please. You have to let me take care of this.

SYDNEY	You can't take care of this. If you could, he'd be gone. (sobs)

EVA	(sighs)

JUNIOR	I don't understand how you can quarterback and can't win the damn video game.

BOJOHN	You'll see. One more play. Come one.

JUNIOR	You still not tired of this ass whoopin'?

BOJOHN	Your luck's about to run out.

TIESHA	Hey, they're posting about us on the GAMU website.

JUNIOR	This is skill. This ain't luck, boy.

TIESHA	Did y'all hear me?

BOJOHN	Hold on. I'm about to win.

JUNIOR	You ain't 'bout to win shit. Game! Got your ass, boy. Whoo-hoo!

BOJOHN	God. One more time.

TIESHA	We are blowing up the website. (laughs) Look at this one. "Freaky friends, y'all want a fourth?"

JUNIOR	"Freaky friends give me life."

BOJOHN	Freaky friends, tag me in.

JUNIOR	I told y'all it'd work.

TIESHA	What the hell? "You not just freaky, you nasty, stank, and disgusting."

JUNIOR	Damn.

BOJOHN	This is crazy.

JUNIOR	"Why they want that THOT?"

TIESHA	"Athletes always go for hoes." I knew y'all was going too far with this mess in the cafeteria.

JUNIOR	Tiesha, who's idea was that?

TIESHA	I know you not playing me.

BOJOHN	Actually, I am. All that adlibbing when we had a nice, well-written script.

TIESHA	Your script was whack. I shouldn't have helped y'all asses.

JUNIOR	You could've said no.

TIESHA	What I should've said was, "Kiss my ass."

BOJOHN	Hey, wait!

JUNIOR	All because you was playing around in class.

BOJOHN	We still gotta write a paper, so just stop, okay?

JUNIOR	You write yours and I'ma write mine. How 'bout that?

BOJOHN	Just bail on your own project. Awesome, dude.

CECIL	You three are the finalists to replace Benedict Danny. There'll be one final performance round after I get out of prison. One of you has a . GPA. You start now, there's a deficit. My advice : work harder. I look  forward to seeing who wants it the most. You're dismissed.

DR. PATEL	Good morning, Cecil.

CECIL	Morning.

DR. PATEL	I have news on the clinical trial we talked about. You got in.

CECIL	What's the side effects of this wonder drug?

DR. PATEL	Nausea, fatigue, joint pain. Rare cases: blood clots, stroke.

CECIL	Jesus, Doc.

DR. PATEL	Your life might get extended by a few years if you get the drug.

CECIL	If I get the drug?

DR. PATEL	The study is a double blind study. You could get the drug. You could get the placebo.

CECIL	You might this, you might that. You might get the drug and be miserable. You might not get it and die.

DR. PATEL	Cecil--

CECIL	I appreciate your help, Dr. Patel. But I-I think I'ma pass. Just go with the traditional treatment.

DR. PATEL	I'll bring your treatment oncologist by this afternoon.

CECIL	(sighs)

COACH HARDWICK	Come in.

TERRENCE	Oh. Excuse me, Coach. I thought you wanted to see me.

COACH HARDWICK	I do. Take a seat. This is Ashley Watkins. She's a defense attorney.

ASHLEY	Hello, Terrence.

TERRENCE	No offense, ma'am, but Coach, I'm innocent. I don't need a lawyer.

COACH HARDWICK	You will when you talk to the cops.

ASHLEY	Look, I was with that DA's office for six years. You need someone who knows their playbook, and I do.

TERRENCE	But I don't have money for this. Neither does my family.

ASHLEY	No, I'll represent you completely  pro bono. It'll be free to you.

TERRENCE	Why? You think I did it?

COACH HARDWICK	Now just relax. I promised your mother if you came to GAMU, I'd make sure you have everything you need while you're here. Right now, you need a lawyer. All right? Ashley's husband is an alum. Played football right here. Terrence, I need you to trust me. Just tell her your story.

ASHLEY	We can--we can just take it slowly. Tell me what I need to know. Stop, take a break whenever you want to. Okay?

DRE	Ced here?

BRYCE	I think he's still in class. But I'll tell him you came by.

DRE	Damn, I thought he said he only had morning classes today. All right. I'll hit him up later.

BRYCE	Or you could just leave him out of whatever you came here to do.

DRE	Hey, look, man, you don't know nothin' about this, rich boy.

BRYCE	I know more than you think I know. And I saw him with your sister. They were crazy about each other. When she came down here, all she could talk about was her man's future. Seems like whatever it is you're getting him into is gonna take that future away.

CEDRIC	What's up?

BRYCE	Nothing.

DRE	Got some brews.

CEDRIC	All right, fam.

ELLA	Good morning.

LASS	Good morning.

ELLA	I'm excited to hear what you've discovered regarding gender attitudes. BoJohn, Junior, since you inspired this new assignment, why don't we start with you? Well, we don't have all day. Come on down.
BOJOHN	Honestly, I don't think it's a very good idea to tell everybody your personal business.

JUNIOR	And the people who you think are your friends really aren't your friends.

ELLA	Please tell us what you've learned regarding gender attitudes. Your actual assignment.

BOJOHN	People don't care if you're a man or a woman. If they want to believe something about you, especially if it's sexual, they will.

JUNIOR	And the freakier it is, the worse it'll be for you. People get all judgmental and vicious on you.

ELLA	Well, if people learn something about you that is based on a rumor and not the truth, it makes things complicated. I heard about the rumors. Freaky Friends.

JUNIOR	Dr. Caldwell, we was just trying to have fun with it.


BOJOHN	But it all went wrong. People were calling Tiesha a whore, a trick, and a lot worse.

ELLA	Anybody call either of you a whore?

BOJOHN AND JUNIOR	No.

JUNIOR	Somebody did say the three of us would burn in hell.

ELLA	I think you two need a do-over. I want you take this assignment seriously. Attitudes about gender are real and sometimes dangerous. Just look at the recent presidential election. Proof that a woman is treated differently than a man. Think about it. We just elected a man who bragged about grabbing a woman's genitals, and even some women accepted it as locker room talk. And that's what your written report should be about.

DOMINIQUE	Oh, wow. Look at this guy. I-I feel special, good doctor. Thank you. You went all out.

EVA	I promised you a proper thank you.

DOMINIQUE	I like a woman who keeps her promises.

EVA	And I like a man who keeps his.

DOMINIQUE	How's the audit going?

EVA	To be frank, some improprieties have come to light.

DOMINIQUE	Mm, you mean embezzlement.

EVA	I didn't say that. And I'm only sharing in the interest of transparency. I feel certain we won't find anything that would give donors pause.

WOMAN	Ma'am.

DOMINIQUE	Yeah, I'ma go on the record and say that I wouldn't be surprised if the same bougie negroes that have been looking down their noses at me have been robbing GAMU blind.

EVA	I'm sure that is not what we'll find. It'll all get straightened out. Hopefully quickly.

DOMINIQUE	All right, sounds good. I'll handle the donors. You focus on the audit. You know, enough about business. Tell me about you.

EVA	What would you like to know?

DOMINIQUE	I don't know. Everything.

EVA	(laughs) How much time do you have?

DOMINIQUE	I make time for what's important to me.

EVA	How could I be important to you? You don't even know me.

DOMINIQUE	True, true. Maybe I want to.

WOMAN	We're ready for you.

EVA	It appears dinner is served.

CECIL	Hey. Wasn't expecting to see you again.

CYNTHIA	Thought you'd be tired of eating hospital food. So I brought you lobster tails, crispy Brussels  sprouts, and truffle mashed potatoes.

CECIL	Thank you. What do I owe you?

CYNTHIA	I can afford to treat you to dinner, Cecil.

BETTYE	Cecil, hello. What, Mr. Diamond, is that seafood I smell? You know that shellfish is a no-no.

CYNTHIA	Why? You aren't allergic, are you?

CECIL	It's something with my meds. It's okay, Bettye. You can go. I'm not gonna eat it. You can go now.

BETTYE	You know what, I can put that in the fridge for you until you're ready to go.

CECIL	Will you please leave?

BETTYE	Okay. Sure will.

CECIL	Seafood and my meds don't mix.

CYNTHIA	What medicine? What's it for?

CECIL	My kidneys. I don't know. Something.

CYNTHIA	What's wrong with your kidneys?

CECIL	Why you askin' so many damn questions?

CYNTHIA	I can see that you need some time to rest. I guess I would feel the same way if I were in here.

CECIL	The kidney thing is a lie. I was supposed to start taking this new drug soon for a study. And you can't eat shellfish when you take it. But I opted out. Stupid-ass nurse should've known.

CYNTHIA	Well, I see. It's your business and I won't ask any more questions.

CECIL	The study and the drug are...are for lung cancer.

CYNTHIA	That--that's what you have?

CECIL	Yep. Non-small cell lung cancer.

CYNTHIA	I'm sorry. Is that the real reason you showed up at my house? To tell me you're sick?

CECIL	I don't know.

CYNTHIA	You know, there's no one that I know that hates being sick more than you.

CECIL	It's a bitch.

CYNTHIA	I never thought that...you still cared about me and Mama. Or that you could still be hurting, even after you got out.

CECIL	How would you know? I left and never came back. Never even called until after Mama died.

CYNTHIA	I was so mad at you for showing up at her funeral.

CECIL	I was mad at me...for not coming sooner.

CYNTHIA	(laughs)

REPORTER	Breaking news. A Chicago man is found dead in Atlanta. Stony  Phillips is on the scene.

STONY	A young man was found dead today in Atlanta Park. He was shot multiple times and has been identified as Russell Franklin from Chicago. Apparently Mr. Franklin was part of the security detail for an up-and-coming rapper, also from Chicago. Police are investigating. We'll keep you updated.

DRE	Ced.

CEDRIC	What the hell happened? Where you been?

DRE	Better time and place.

CEDRIC	What? You just left me out? I was ready. On my soul, I was ready.


DRE	No, I know you was ready, brah, but look. Like I said, a better chance came up to take of that, so I took it.

CEDRIC	(sighs) Yeah, all right.

DRE	Plus, Chantel wouldn't want you getting down like that, brah. Mess up what you got here. Want a ride to your dorm?

CEDRIC	Nah, I'm good. It's right up there.

DRE	All right, then, fam. Heading back up the road. Keep your head up.
