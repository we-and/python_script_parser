KAREN	Hello? Is anybody home?

ASHLEY	Hi!

KAREN	Hi there. My name's Karen. What's yours?

FARMER BARNES	Ashley. What did I tell you about...

FARMER BARNES	...talking to strangers?

ASHLEY	She's not a stranger. She's Karen.

KAREN	Dr. Karen Cavanaugh. I'm the researcher from Eastern State.

KAREN	Oh, my God.

FARMER BARNES	Yeah, it's a damn shame.

FARMER BARNES	Been trying to off-load the meat, you know? Make up what I lost in wool, but... who's gonna buy poisoned sheep?
ASHLEY	What does this one do? What about this one?

FARMER BARNES	Ashley, leave Dr. Cavanaugh alone.

KAREN	It's okay. I could use a research assistant.

ASHLEY	And what about this one?

KAREN	That analyzes soil samples to see if there's anything in the ground that might be poisoning the animals.

ASHLEY	And this one.

KAREN	That checks for pesticides...

KAREN	...and any other poisons that might sprayed on the crops. And this is just a camera for taking photos.

KAREN	Ashley?

KAREN	Ashley!

FARMER BARNES	Ashley! What happened?

KAREN	I don't know. I...

KAREN	...looked up and she was down.

FARMER BARNES	Ashley.

KAREN	She's barely breathing.

KAREN	I don't...

KAREN	...have a signal!

FARMER BARNES	Dr. Rowe's office is just on Main Street.

KAREN	We need a hospital.

FARMER BARNES	Closest hospital's two hours away.
DOC ROWE	Bring her back here.
FARMER BARNES	It's okay, baby. There you go.
DOC ROWE	5Her pulse is strong. (beat) She's breathing steady now. From what...
DOC ROWE	...you said on the phone, I'd...
DOC ROWE	...say this is hypercapnia. But I never heard of anyone getting carbon dioxide poisoning...
DOC ROWE	...in an open field. Are you sure she wasn't locked inside somewhere?

KAREN	Cameroon.

DOC ROWE	What's that, Miss?
FARMER BARNES	Oh, thank God. There she is. How's my baby girl?
ASHLEY	I'm not a baby, Dad.

KAREN	I was afraid I wouldn't be able to finish my work without my assistant.
KAREN	Do you have I computer I can use? I need to check the Internet.
DOC ROWE	Back here. 
KAREN	There's this lake in Cameroon.

FARMER BARNES	Hey.

REPORTER OVER TV	This is an emergency alert.
FARMER BARNES	Look at that.

REPORTER OVER TV	...following these breaking news.
REPORTER OVER TV	...earthquake has now been confirmed.

REPORTER OVER TV	There are growing reports...

REPORTER OVER TV	...of a coastal disaster. What you're seeing is video...

REPORTER OVER TV	...from our San Francisco affiliate, just moments before the satellite link went down.

REPORTER OVER TV	It seems everything south of Sacramento has gone dark.

KAREN	Oh, my...

REPORTER OVER TV	All phone, Internet and satellite communication was lost...

REPORTER OVER TV	...almost simultaneously about a half hour ago.

FARMER BARNES	What the hell is going on?

REPORTER OVER TV	Earlier reports of the possible collapse...

REPORTER OVER TV	...of the West Antarctic ice sheet remain unconfirmed.

REPORTER OVER TV	appears to be a major seismic event, and the situation is still developing. What we know so far--

KAREN	What is this? 

DAVIS	Hi.

ERIN	Oh!

DAVIS	I'm Davis. (beat) No, I know it sounds like a last name,  but it's not. It's my first name. Oh, and...
DAVIS	...this is Erin. 

ERIN	I can't believe they're sending us up in this. Is it even safe to fly?

DAVIS	Erin, relax. If I could take off in a Blackhawk under fire in Fallujah, I think I can handle News Chopper 9 with a hangover.

ERIN	Hangover!

DAVIS	Get to the chopper, now.

DAVIS	Now!

DAVIS	It's like that all the way up the coast. At least...

DAVIS	...as far as we went, anyway.

ERIN	And it couldn't have just been a...

ERIN	...wave. It went on forever. Like the sea levels rose, you know, you know, but all at once.

DAVIS	We headed...

DAVIS	...inland to Santa Rosa, refueled in Reno. But there was an earthquake there, and it was exactly the same in Boise.

WALLY	Boise? Well, where were you headed?

DAVID	Well, I've got family in Bozeman, but it looks like I pushed my chopper a little too hard.

WALLY	Well, you're more than welcome to stay here as long as you like. You'll be safe.

KAREN	Mayor, that may not be the case.

WALLY	Dr. Cavanaugh, was it?

KAREN	Karen. Have you ever heard of Cameroon?

WALLY	Cameroon?

KAREN	Back in the 80's...
KAREN	...thousands of villagers near Lake Nyos were asphyxiated, just like Barnes's sheep. It was carbon dioxide. It hovers off the ground no more than 3 or 4 feet, which is why Ashley was affected, but not us.
WALLY	What's causing it?
KAREN	Lake Nyos is in the crater of a dormant volcano.
WALLY	We don't have a volcano.

DAVIS	That's not true.
DAVIS	Yellowstone is 90 miles from here. 
DAVIS	All those hot springs? I mean, that place is one giant volcano.

WALLY	You think Yellowstone's a threat? Now?

KAREN	Look, I am just trying to piece together what happened to Ashley, the sheep, and now their story. 

WALLY	How does a tsunami have anything to do with a volcano and dead sheep?

KAREN	The news report that was on before the TV went out.

KAREN	It said that there was a massive underwater earthquake, which would explain the tsunami.

KAREN	The weight of that much water shifting on tectonic plates could strain Yellowstone to the breaking point.

WALLY	Okay, but you don't know this for sure.

DAVIS	After what I've seen today, I'd be inclined to take any warning.

KAREN	Look, I wish someone could tell me I'm wrong.

ERIN	Do we know that everything's down?

ERIN	Landlines, cell phones...
ERIN	...Internet?

DAVIS	How about a CB, or a HAM radio?

WALLY	Oh, no, not him. Why does it always have to be him?

KAREN	Friendly. 
DAVIS	Not one of these survivalists.

DAVIS	Please, don't use that word.

CHIEF	Or "prepper".

WALLY	Amos Cade! It's Mayor Wally! 

WALLY	Amos.
WALLY	We're here because...
WALLY	...well, I

CADE	I know why you're here. So y'all can just turn around and back away from my property.

WALLY	It's an emergency.

CADE	Yeah, I'll say it is. TEOTWAWKI. The end of the world as we know it.
CADE	I'll give you the count of 10, Wally.

CHIEF	State of Emergency rules, I can confiscate it.

DAVIS	W-w-w-wait a minute. What, are you trying to set him off?

CADE	I knew, when it finally happened, I'd be getting an unwanted knock on my door, Wally. I just never figured you'd have the guts to do it.

KAREN	Hi, Mr. Cade? 

KAREN	My name's Dr. Karen Cavanaugh. 

KAREN	We need your help.

CADE	Doctor, huh? Why don't you go ask your insurance.
CADE	...company for help?

KAREN	I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm a scientist, and I think we might be in real danger here, so, if we could just use your radio.

CADE	You're unprepared. When it finally hits the fan, the phones and the computers are down, and you figure you'll just confiscate what's mine!

KAREN	I'm sorry...
KAREN	...the Chief shouldn't have said that. See, this concerns you, too. If I'm right, your safe house might not be so...

KAREN	...safe after all.

CADE	Don't patronize me, Doctor. I'm not one of these country yokels.

DAVIS	Yellowstone!
DAVIS	She thinks it might be priming to blow.
CADE	I'm not a conspiracy nut, either.

KAREN	Mr. Cade!
KAREN	Farmer Barnes lost a herd of sheep to CO2 venting, an early warning sign of volcanic activity.
CADE	You're sure about that?
KAREN	No. That's why I'd like to borrow some time on your radio.
CADE	Wally, you oughta let the lady doctor do all your talking.

CADE	And I'd lose the whirlybird.

DAVIS	I can still hear you!

CADE	Yeah, I know.

WALLY	Anything yet?

DAVIS	Just some crazy rumors and conspiracy theories, though this is Cade's radio.
WALLY	What do we know for sure?

VOGEL	Nothing good.

DAVIS	One guy claims that Seattle's under water and Eastern Washington's under Martial Law.

CADE	Yeah, and there's talk of a refugee crisis in New Mexico and Nevada.

WALLY	Anything about Yellowstone?

KAREN	Farmers east of Idaho Falls, west of Cody, Wyoming, and south of Livingston, all with dead livestock.

WALLY	Nothing from the authorities?

DAVIS	Just the Emergency Broadcast recording...

DAVIS	...on the military frequencies.
CADE	Hope you're not counting on the military.

DAVIS	I did for two tours in Afghanistan.

CADE	Combat Infantry, Desert Storm '91, whirlybird man.

DAVIS	You're really good with nicknames.

VOGEL	Even without...

VOGEL	...confirmation from FEMA or Civil Defense, I think Karen's right.

CADE	Says the high school science teacher.

VOGEL	Yeah, I think I know what I'm talking about.

WALLY	You really think Yellowstone's gonna blow?

VOGEL	Even if it's not a full-blown eruption, this valley could experience catastrophic quakes, gas pockets, hydrothermal explosions.

KAREN	If the wind's blowing in the wrong direction, an ash cloud could poison the air, the reservoir, or more CO2 venting, and one morning nobody wakes up. We've been reviewing these geological maps.

KAREN	Our best bet is to head for higher ground in the Rockies north of here.

WALLY	Evacuate? 

KAREN	If I'm right, everything within a hundred miles of the caldera is dead. No warning sign, no time to evacuate, just dead.
KAREN	When it blew up last, what, half a million years ago?

VOGEL	640 thousand.

KAREN	It was an area the size of Los Angeles. It seared the earth as far as the Tetons and south to Jackson.

VOGEL	It was the equivalent of 10 thousand Mt. St. Helens.

WALLY	With all due respect, Dr. Cavanaugh, we're talking about half a million years ago?

KAREN	Barnes's sheep died two days ago!

DAVIS	You wanna wait until lava's rolling down Main Street?

VOGEL	Look, this thing is fed by a molten magna hot spot underneath the Earth's crust. It extends in a southwest direction, across the Idaho-Montana border.

KAREN	We are right in the line of fire.

WALLY	How much time do we have?

VOGEL	Even if I had USGS data... it would still be a guess.

DAVIS	Karen, what do you think?
KAREN	24 hours.

WALLY	24 hours 

KAREN	I'd say go now, if I thought that was remotely possible.
CHIEF	Mayor! You gotta come see this.
WALLY	Everybody...
WALLY	...calm down. Please, one at a time.
FARMER BARNES	I can't just leave my farm.
DAVIS	Mr. Barnes, what happened to your sheep was a warning sign. Our best bet is to head north into the mountains for the protection of the granite bedrock.
CHIEF	Why not a city? Spokane, or Boise?

TOWNSPERSON	Of course. Yeah, yeah. Why not?
DAVIS	The coast is flooded, and the inland cities are choked with refugees. And I saw Boise. It's a hole in the ground.

FARMER BARNES	Who ordered...
FARMER BARNES	...this evacuation? Is it a...

FARMER BARNES	...federal thing?

WALLY	Well, actually, I'm ordering it.

TOWNSPERSON	Oh...
TOWNSPERSON	...Wally, why?

CHIEF	Mayor, are you sure about this? Shouldn't we wait until we contact the authorities?

DAVIS	Wait until when...
DAVIS	...until it's too late? I was in San Francisco! We had no warning!
FARMER BARNES	You really think my dead sheep means we gotta evacuate the whole town?
DAVIS	I do. You all saw the giant crack outside the school. We stay here, we die.

DAVIS	Out there, at least we have a chance.

WALLY	Everybody...
WALLY	...calm down.

KAREN	We don't need someone else to tell us how to react to a crisis. We are intelligent people who can reason and deduce.
CADE	I don't need a government committee to tell me when I'm in danger.
DAVIS	Don't wait for someone else to hand...
DAVIS	...it to you.

KAREN	Be the hero of your own story.
DAVIS	I'll be right back.

ERIN	Final preparations for the evacuation of Pleasant Creek are now underway. Exodus. Residents are gathering all the food, water, and medical supplies they can carry for the exodus of Pleasant Creek.

VOGEL	She does know that she's not...

VOGEL	...on the air?

DAVIS	Yeah, but someone's gotta tell the story, right? Let's just hope someone's left to hear it.
WALLY	Grab anything non-perishable. And see if you can find first-aid kits in the pharmacy.

WALLY	Oh, I know what you're gonna say.

KAREN	You have to find a way to make everyone go.
WALLY	What more can we say? You want me to force people to go? I don't have that kind of manpower. All I can do is order the evacuation. I can't force people to do it.
KAREN	There has to be something we can do.

WALLY	Are you sure we're doing the right thing? Maybe we are overreacting.

KAREN	Oh, come on, Wally! Not you, too!
DAVIS	I hope it's enough. I mean, this is gonna be the most valuable resource out there. People might even kill for it.

KAREN	What do you think they're gonna do when the food runs out? The water?

DAVIS	Just get them to the mountains, all right? You'll figure out the rest as you go...
DAVIS	...along. Just face one disaster at a time.

KAREN	You mean, as "we" go"... right? (long beat) You're not coming?

DAVIS	I've got a sister and nephew...
DAVIS	...in Bozeman. I... I gotta see if they're all right. (beat) Just keep an eye on Cade.
KAREN	He's all bluster.

DAVIS	He might be playing nice now, but if things get rough, he could be a very dangerous man.
KAREN	That's what's dangerous. A little spark or something, a lightning strike, and it's a rolling death trap. 

KAREN	I wish you were driving it.

DAVIS	Well, thanks. I may have flown Blackhawks in Afghanistan, but even I'm afraid of this. 

DAVIS	What?

KAREN	Erin said to...

KAREN	...time how long it took you to bring up Blackhawks. 

DAVIS	They'll listen to you. 

KAREN	How do you know?
DAVIS	Because I would. 
KAREN	What's...
KAREN	...going on?

CHIEF	I'll give you two guesses, but you'll only need one.

KAREN	Cade?
CHIEF	Jesús Cristo! Cade! What the hell are you guys doing?
CADE	Protecting what's mine. They're trying to steal from me.

WALLY	Nobody's...

WALLY	...stealing from you...
WALLY	...you crazy bastard! We're just taking inventory!

CADE	What's mine is for me and my own.
KAREN	What if I felt that way?

CADE	You're not gonna sweet talk me, darling. You ain't got nothing to protect. Without the rule of law, first they come begging, then they come demanding. Well, your welfare state is over. You can't take what's mine just because you didn't think ahead.

DAVIS	Look...

DAVIS	...Cade, we're all in this together!
CADE	Says those with nothing to contribute. You just figured, since you could sucker me out of my radio, that I was just a sucker.
CADE	Go ahead...
CADE	...take your shot.

KAREN	Don't.
WALLY	Is this it? Is it happening?
CADE	Where you going? Hey!

CADE	Who's gonna help me carry all this stuff?

KAREN	Get in the cars!

KAREN	Get into the lead truck and go!
KAREN	We can't get out of here unless it's moving! Go!

DAVIS	Karen!
DAVIS	I'll get the fuel truck.

KAREN	Thank you.
CADE	Chief! Chief!

CADE	Help me out, man!
KAREN	Ashley!

KAREN	Are you hurt?
KAREN	Mr. Barnes! Mr. Barnes.
SUTTON	Cade, come on! Come on!
KAREN	Open the door!

KAREN	Go, go, go!

KAREN	No!

DAVIS	Karen?

KAREN	We have to save them!

KAREN	How many lost?

DAVIS	I don't know, but we can't stop here.
KAREN	Maybe I should go back. I can get in a truck and I can see if there's anybody--

DAVIS	Karen! There's nothing to go back to.

DAVIS	That's why you have to keep it together.
DAVIS	We gotta keep moving.
DAVIS	How's Ashley? 

KAREN	Sam and Diane are with her. She's pretty broken up. (beat) You too scared to keep riding the death trap?

DAVIS	I gotta go.

KAREN	I understand.
DAVIS	I know how to get to Triple Divide. Maybe I'll see you there.
KAREN	Take care of yourself, Davis.
DAVIS	Remember what I said about Cade.
VOGEL	Where's he going?

KAREN	Something he needs to find out for himself.

VOGEL	Is he coming back?

KAREN	I don't think so.
WALLY	So it looks like we take the...
WALLY	...I-15 to Dillon, then take...

WALLY	...Highway 43.

VOGEL	Uh, hold on. 
VOGEL	Yeah. See, the problem is...

VOGEL	...all this through here...
VOGEL	...that's more dangerous than where we came.

WALLY	I guess we could get off the I-15... on 278, and loop around. I just don't know any other way that doesn't take us on the I-15 at least part of the way.

CADE	I do. 

CADE	Where's your bad area, Doctor?
CADE	Okay, that's easy. 

CADE	You take Blacktail up to Dillon over the 278.
CADE	It keeps you off the I-15.

VOGEL	Yeah, but how do we get to Blacktail?
CADE	There's a mining access road that runs parallel, just past the next junction...
CADE	...9 or 10 miles up.

ERIN	How do you know about that?

CADE	I was looking at some land up there for a B.O.L. I got priced out by some Hollywood types.

WALLY	I have absolutely no idea...
WALLY	...what you just said.

ERIN	B.O.L. is a bug-out location.
ERIN	I did a story on one of those "Prepper" apocalypse shows.
CADE	Yeah, those shows are all garbage. It's propaganda. See--
WALLY	Are you sure about this road, uh,  in the property that you bought?

CADE	I didn't buy it. I couldn't afford it. You know, if Yellowstone is so dangerous, why is the land there so expensive? I thought this whole volcano thing was just a real estate scam, a cover story to scare people off, you know?
ERIN	A conspiracy, huh? 
CADE	Blacktail... 278. I'm sure.
KAREN	Amos.
CADE	Doc.

KAREN	I'm really glad to have somebody like you on our team.
CADE	We're not on the same team. We're just travelling in the same direction.
IRENE	Time to eat, guys. We lost...

IRENE	...a lot of the food, so make it last. (to Oswald) There you go. (to Cade) And for you.

IRENE	You doing okay, sweetie?

ASHLEY	Yeah.

IRENE	There you are.

ASHLEY	Thanks.

CADE	Why does she get so much?

IRENE	She's 10.

WALLY	Every time I think there's a decent human being in there...

WALLY	...he does everything he can to prove me wrong.

WALLY	Oh, good.

DAVIS	Hey!

BANDANA	Get outta here, man! This house is mine!

DAVIS	This house belongs to my sister!

BANDANA	Nothing belongs to nobody no more. 

BANDANA	Trust me, you don't wanna be here.

TINY	No, you don't!

TINY	Hurry up, man! 

DAVIS	Get out of my house.

BANDANA	Look, we...

BANDANA	...saw nobody here, that's the truth.

DAVIS	Empty your pockets now. 

BANDANA	Look--

DAVIS	Now!

BANDANA	Okay. Here you go.

KAREN	Stop!

WALLY	What do we do?

CADE	Nothing we can do. No one could survive that.

WALLY	Good God!

CADE	We gotta get off this ridge before there's another earthquake. Back in the truck.

WALLY	He's right, Karen. We gotta go.

VINCE	...you let yourselves be...

VINCE	...ruled! You wanted to feel safe under the skirts of mother...

VINCE	...government. (continues under dialogue) To feed and clothe you...

KAREN	How can he be the only one broadcasting?

ERIN	Does...

ERIN	...anybody actually believe all this crap?

VINCE	...in exchange...

VINCE	...for an empty promise of security.

VINCE	Where's that security now? Where's the government that said it would protect you?

CADE	Finally someone speaking the truth.

VINCE	So, where is this New World Order?

SUTTON	Damn straight.

VINCE	They're all holed up in the mountaintop fortresses or their private space stations, just waiting...

VINCE	...for the rest of us to go feral and destroy each other.

KAREN	Hey.

IRENE	Hey.

KAREN	Can you take this to Ashley?

IRENE	Oh, yeah, no problem.

KAREN	Thanks.

IRENE	All right. See you later.

KAREN	Where'd you find that?

OSWALD	Hey, pass...

OSWALD	...it here. 

KAREN	You're holding out on us? Amos Cade, I'm disappointed in you.

CADE	Darling... share and share alike ain't how this is gonna play out. Now, you're a smart girl. You know that.

KAREN	We need to work together.

CADE	Hey.

CADE	Now, I told you before, what's mine is for me and my own.

CADE	I thought so.

CADE	Why don't you just scamper off back to camp. You can keep playing Commander in Chief all you want. Just remember one thing. 

CADE	Ain't no one ever ruled over me... and no one ever will.

CADE	Well, go on. What are you waiting for?

DAVIS	She's waiting on me.

KAREN	Hi, Davis.

DAVIS	I missed a lot.

CADE	Mr. Whirlybird. Let's see if you have the guts to pull the trigger.

CADE	I ain't afraid of dying.

DAVIS	Anyone who stockpiles guns, hoards food, and booby-traps his own home is terrified of dying.

KAREN	It's okay, Davis.

KAREN	It was just a little misunderstanding.

DAVIS	He was pointing a gun at you!

KAREN	And now you're pointing one at him.

KAREN	Let's just call this even and... talk about it tomorrow with clear heads.

CADE	Ain't nothing to talk about.

CADE	Doc.

CADE	I took your measure tonight. I know how far you'll go. (long beat) You can't say the same thing for me.

CADE	You remember that the next time you sneak up on me in the dark.

KAREN	Let's go.

IRENE	Are we safe here?

DAVIS	I don't know if anywhere is safe.

KAREN	Let's just hope whatever's gonna happen here... already happened.

ERIN	Do you hear that?

KAREN	Is that--?

ERIN	There!

ASHLEY	Hey! Hey!

KAREN	Down here!

ERIN	We're here! We're down here!

KAREN	Please! No!

DAVIS	It's Ashley!

DAVIS	Ashley!

WALLY	Karen!

DAVIS	Karen!

VOGEL	What happened?

VOGEL	Ashley screamed!

KAREN	That was...

KAREN	...him.

VINCE	It's my fault. 

VINCE	I caught them off guard. I didn't mean to scare them!

DAVIS	What are you doing...

DAVIS	...here?

VINCE	Exercising my right to free speech.

ERIN	Wait a second.

ERIN	You're the conspiracy guy. The one on the radio.

VINCE	Conspiracy guy? That's...

VINCE	...what I get, "conspiracy guy"?

VINCE	Yeah, well, yeah, that's me.

VINCE	I used to broadcast out of my house until they figured out what I was all about...

VINCE	...and my place was bugged. Harassing phone calls, black helicopters. Shh!

VINCE	Maybe they...

VINCE	...did me a favor. If I wasn't here when the whole damn town went to hell, I wouldn't be here at all.

WALLY	Do you know...

WALLY	...what's going on? What happened?

VINCE	Well...

VINCE	...I-I won't pretend that it isn't bad. It's bad. Oh, wait, but I can show you!

VINCE	I was able to download these before the grid collapsed.

KAREN	This can't be possible.

ERIN	It's really all gone.

KAREN	I just can't...

KAREN	...believe it's really this bad.

VINCE	We all know this was...

VINCE	...manmade, right? They let this happen on purpose.

VINCE	They knew.

VINCE	I hate to say "I told you so"... but I told you so. I mean, I've been talking about this for years. For years.

WALLY	What about the rest of the world? Ha-have you heard about-anything from Europe or-or Asia?

VINCE	Total blackout. It's exactly what they want...

VINCE	...everyone in the dark.

ERIN	Who exactly are "they"?

VINCE	Them! The royal "they". The Illuminati. The New World Order. Puppet masters that control everyone. CIA, DARPA, the-the-the Kremlin.

ERIN	And what exactly do they do? 

VINCE	Area 51. MK Ultra. GM...

VINCE	...crop manipulation. Weather control. Mind control! You think that's fluoride in the water?

SUTTON	And the damn chem-...

SUTTON	...trails, pumping chemicals in the atmosphere, making us all impotent.

CADE	Maybe they're making you impotent, Sutton, but my gear works out just fine.

CADE	No, Vince...

CADE	...this is where you and I disagree. I just don't believe that government workers are clever enough to run a conspiracy. They sure as hell don't care enough.

ERIN	I actually agree with you, Mr. Cade.

CADE	Did you assume I was just a conspiracy nut?

ASHLEY	I wanna go home.

KAREN	Oh. Me too, sweetie. Where we're going is gonna be our new home. You'll see.

KAREN	I'm gonna be outside, okay? If you need anything, you just call out.

ASHLEY	Are you gonna come back?

KAREN	Of course I will. Whatever happens, we stick together, right? You're my assistant.

KAREN	Get some sleep.

CADE	The Antarctica is in the south...

CADE	...right. And there's an ancient-- 

CADE	Like, that-that might have been before the planet shifted on its axis and the ice cap moved. 

CADE	That was like, it could've been Atlantis or (indistinct). But anyway, it was like a major... alien base.

DAVIS	You missed all the conspiracy talk.

KAREN	Lucky me.

KAREN	Hey, I wanted to thank you for coming back. You saved my ass.

KAREN	What's he doing? What is all this?

DAVIS	Winning hearts and minds. I'm not sure what his play is, but I'm pretty sure he's laying the groundwork for a coup d'état.

CADE	Hey, everyone...

CADE	...I got a little surprise I've been saving.

CADE	Thought I might share with you all.
KAREN	Why do I ...

KAREN	...have such a bad feeling about this?

DAVIS	'Cause you're smart.

KAREN	I'm glad you're here.

KAREN	Ashley!

DAVIS	The gas!

MAN	What's happening?

DAVIS	Help me with the barrels!

DAVIS	Come on!

KAREN	Hold on, sweetie. Put your arms around my neck.

KAREN	Cover your head with this and hold it tight! As tight as you can! I'll be right back!

ASHLEY	Don't go! No!

WALLY	Go this way! Go this--

ASHLEY	No! No! No!

KAREN	Come here. Come here.

IRENE	Help him out! Help Davis!

VINCE	Get away from that fire!

DAVIS	No!

ERIN	Make it stop! Make it stop! (sobs)

WALLY	Altogether, we've got...

WALLY	...a dozen cans of food... a handful of water jugs. We should fill up what we can before...

WALLY	...we get out of here.

VOGEL	Let me see what I can do.

DAVIS	Well, we... got the truck running, but for how long, I don't know.

WALLY	Not enough fuel to get two vehicles up there anyway.

DAVIS	We'll figure something out, Wally.

WALLY	Erin! Erin, you okay?

ERIN	I found this.

DAVIS	Well, why don't you go see if it'll do any good, sweetie?

ERIN	How is she?

ERIN	I found this.

KAREN	Uh... I'm sorry, this is for like a skinned knee or a paper cut. I just... I don't think there's anything else I can do. She's already septic, and she's burning up with a fever.

ERIN	Isn't there any-anything...?

KAREN	Make her more comfortable, I guess.

ERIN	Is she in pain?

KAREN	I don't even think she knows where she is.

ERIN	Isn't that cruel?

KAREN	I'm gonna see if there's some broth...
KAREN	...or something we can give her.

CADE	Do it.

CADE	It's the humane thing to do.

CADE	You might as well pour that broth on a pile of dirt and pray for flowers. Do it.

KAREN	Is everything okay?

ERIN	I just-- Yeah. Cade's still in there with her.

KAREN	I'll go back.

CADE	It was the right thing to do. You all knew it. But no one had the courage to do it. A leader's gotta be willing to do what needs to be done. And that includes...

CADE	...deciding what to do with these bodies. Can't count on any more pig meat.

DAVIS	You...

DAVIS	...son of a bitch!

KAREN	Davis!

KAREN	Please.

CADE	Three days into those mountains with no food... you'll realize the mistake you made.

DAVIS	No mistake. Choice. Not to be an animal.

CADE	I don't take any joy in the idea of eating human flesh, but if it's between that and dying, I'll do whatever I have to do to survive. See, that's a line that you won't cross, but I will.

CADE	And I'll outlive every single one of you, and you know it.

DAVIS	Get in the truck, Karen.

CADE	You confiscating my gun?

DAVIS	We gave you...

DAVIS	...a fair share cut of the supplies in the office.

CADE	We need a gun to defend ourselves!

DAVIS	That's not my problem anymore.

OSWALD	Damnit, Cade! What do we do now?

CADE	We follow them!

OSWALD	On foot?

CADE	Know any shortcuts?

VINCE	I don't know any shortcuts. I'm a survivalist. I make them.

KAREN	Last of the food and the water.

WALLY	Save it for Ashley. We have no choice. We need supplies.

DAVIS	I think, guys, we risk I-15.

OSWALD	What is that?

VINCE	Oh, sweet merciful heaven.

OSWALD	Oh, she stinks.

OSWALD	Looks like she killed herself.

CADE	Check the...

CADE	...glove box.

OSWALD	Bingo.

CADE	I'll never understand what happens to a person makes them lose the will to survive.

VINCE	Some people just lose hope.

CADE	It's not about hope, really. It's about will. Time you should start asking yourself how far you're willing to go.

ERIN	Uh...

ERIN	...guys? 

VOGEL	Somebody's already bypassed the electronics. I think I can get the pump working.

DAVIS	Well, make it fast. Whoever set this up could come back. We're not the only ones looking for fuel.

WALLY	Somebody's coming!
 
DAVIS	Just fill the pick-up. We'll leave the truck!

WALLY	Maybe they're friendly.

DAVIS	We gotta go!

KAREN	What?

ERIN	We think somebody's been living here.

DAVIS	Yeah, I know, and they're back! Come on, we gotta go now! (to Ashley) Let's go, Ashley. Let's go, sweetie.

WALLY	They're not friendly! They're shooting arrows!

DAVIS	Leave the truck! Get in! Everybody in!

DAVIS	We gotta go! Come on! Come here!

DAVIS	Vogel! Gotta go! We gotta go! Come on!

KAREN	Davis! He's been hit!

KAREN	Go! Go!

WALLY	Go, go, go! Now!

KAREN	We gotta get that shaft out of there.

DAVIS	Ah!

KAREN	I'm serious. We leave it in, it'll get infected.

DAVIS	If we take it out, I'll bleed to death.

DAVIS	Not a lot of good options here.

KAREN	Come here.

VINCE	Are you sure we're still heading west?

CADE	We're heading west.

VINCE	But how do you know? I mean, this whole thing could be some kind of magnetic reversal, right?

VINCE	North and south switching polarities. Even compasses would be useless.

CADE	The sun still sets in the west.

VINCE	Are we taking a break? I could sure use it.

CADE	No breaks for you, Mr. Shortcut.

WALLY	How's he doing?

KAREN	We need a hospital.

WALLY	I sure wish Doc Rowe was here.

KAREN	Me, too.

VINCE	This... this wasn't here.

VINCE	Oh, no. Oh, man, this isn't good. We're gonna have to double back. We can't get through this.

CADE	You promised...

CADE	...me a shortcut.

VINCE	Well, I mean- I didn't know. How was I supposed to know?

OSWALD	The hell are supposed to do now, Cade?

CADE	We keep moving! And we stop listening to anything this dumbass says!

VINCE	How was I supposed to know?

CADE	You better find some hidden talents if you wanna stay useful to me.

KAREN	Wally, can you see well enough? Maybe we should stop. I'd rather see a cliff before driving over it.

WALLY	It's thick, but I can see.

ERIN	Ew. What's that smell? Like burning matches?

VOGEL	That's sulfur dioxide. CO2 must be bonding with the water vapor.

WALLY	Should I pull over, wait it out?

VOGEL	No, no, it can be toxic. Enough of a concentration, you get sulfuric acid.

DAVIS	Let's just see if we can push through it, okay?

DAVIS	Oh, what the hell! 

DAVIS	What happened now?

WALLY	I-I didn't do anything. It just stopped.

DAVIS	Pop the hood.

WALLY	Are you okay?

ERIN	Keep the window closed!

VOGEL	All the plastic is melting!

WALLY	What? The car is melting! What the hell is this?

DAVIS	Sulfur...

DAVIS	...dioxide--

WALLY	Whoa, Davis!

WALLY	I need help!

KAREN	Let's get outta here. Now! Go.

KAREN	Okay, come on.

KAREN	We have to find cover!

VOGEL	Got...

VOGEL	...it! Over here!

VOGEL	Over here!

VOGEL	Is everyone okay?

ERIN	Davis doesn't look...

ERIN	...too good.

KAREN	Let's move him further back.

KAREN	Davis?

WALLY	I'll be right back.

VOGEL	Wally!

KAREN	Where you going? 

WALLY	We need supplies!

KAREN	Wally! Come back here!

ERIN	Wally, it's too dangerous!

ERIN	Wally!

KAREN	Damnit.

ERIN	Should I go after him?

VOGEL	No.

KAREN	Can you see him?

ERIN	Wally! Over here! Walk straight! 

VOGEL	Wally, come here!

ERIN	Wally!

VOGEL	Over here! Run! This way!

ERIN	Wally!

KAREN	Wally, Wally. 

KAREN	Sit down!

WALLY	It burns! Burns my eyes!

WALLY	Ah!

KAREN	Wally, hold on!

WALLY	Oh, my eyes!

VOGEL	Hold on.

KAREN	I need a bandage!

WALLY	Water! Pour water on it!

VOGEL	No, it's an acid.

VOGEL	It'll just make it worse.

WALLY	Ah!

VOGEL	It's okay.

KAREN	That was a very stupid and brave thing you did.

WALLY	Yeah.

KAREN	Thank you, Wally.

ERIN	Hang in there, Wally.

KAREN	Davis.

VOGEL	All right, stay here.

KAREN	Ready? One...

KAREN	...two, three.

KAREN	Hey there, stranger. I didn't think you were coming back to us.

KAREN	How you feeling?

DAVIS	Good. I'm fine.

KAREN	Davis, can you see?

DAVIS	Does splotchy blurs count?

KAREN	In this case, yes.

DAVIS	Then no.. I can't see.

KAREN	How else are you doing? How's your stomach?

DAVIS	I gotta be honest, Karen. I don't feel too good. 

KAREN	I'll get you some water.

DAVIS	No, no, don't-don't-don't go! Don't-don't go.

DAVIS	I hate to do this to you, Karen...

DAVIS	...but you're just gonna have to be stronger, all right?

KAREN	Stop it!

DAVIS	Get them there any way you can!

DAVIS	Especially Ashley. She--

DAVIS	She deserves to have a life.

KAREN	In a couple of days...

KAREN	...you're gonna feel so embarrassed about this speech you just gave. 

DAVIS	I really wish I'd met you before the end of the world.

KAREN	Don't do this, Davis.

DAVIS	You know, it's funny.

DAVIS	All these Blackhawk missions... and I get taken out by a little mist. (coughs)

KAREN	Davis.

KAREN	Davis!

KAREN	No.

CADE	They've been here.

VINCE	Okay, relax. They're just nervous. Wouldn't you be?

VINCE	Let me take care of it. Hey there.

VINCE	We're just looking for some people that passed through here.

VINCE	Don't worry...

VINCE	...we don't want any trouble.

VINCE	Hey, hey, there's no need for that.

CADE	Maybe we can help each other.

CADE	You got something I want, I got something you want. You tell me what happened to the folks in that truck, and I'll serve you dinner.

VINCE	What? 

CADE	Dinner's served.

VOGEL	Ready?

KAREN	Yeah.

KAREN	Oh, my. Look at that!

KAREN	You think there's fish in there?

ERIN	It's a river, Wally. A beautiful mountain river.

WALLY	I can hear it.

KAREN	Let's go.

KAREN	Hey!

WALLY	Did he catch one? 

WALLY	All right!

ERIN	Hey!

ASHLEY	Wow!

WALLY	After what we've been through, it seems...

WALLY	...this is the finest meal I've ever had.

VOGEL	Clean water! Stars in the sky. If this is the New World Order, count me in.

ERIN	I wonder if they made it.

WALLY	Cade probably ate them.

ERIN	That's not funny. 

ERIN	He might've.

ERIN	I liked Vince.

ERIN	He wasn't...

ERIN	...such a bad guy.

ERIN	Crazy. But...

KAREN	The world was a scary place even before all this happened. For some, it's easier to have someone else to blame. It was "them". "They" did it. Makes it seem less random.

KAREN	Maybe you don't have control, but...

KAREN	...somebody does.

KAREN	Anyway, we should all probably snuggle in and get some sleep. Tomorrow we gotta start on the shelter.

CADE	First light.

KAREN	 Vogel, wake up! Wake up!

VOGEL	What's going on?

KAREN	Ashley's gone.

VOGEL	What?

KAREN	I heard her scream, and I found a jug by the river.

VOGEL	Oh, my God, what if she fell in the river?

KAREN	That's not all I found.

VOGEL	Cade.

KAREN	He left it where I'd see it. But I think if Ashley hadn't screamed, he would've killed us all in our sleep.

VOGEL	Okay. I'll get the others.

KAREN	Listen to me very carefully. Get them and head up river as far as you can, and don't stop until you find someplace with some cover.

VOGEL	No.

KAREN	I'll catch up to you if I can. The last thing Davis...

KAREN	...asked me was to make sure that Ashley got a chance at life, and I'm gonna do that. 

VOGEL	Karen--

KAREN	I'm not losing anyone else.

VOGEL	I think all this survival stuff's gone to your head. How are you gonna handle Cade, huh?

KAREN	I may not be a survivalist, but at least I'm prepared.

KAREN	Get them to safety, Larry Vogel. I'm counting on you.

CADE	I was really hoping...

CADE	...you'd be bringing that bottle with you. My new friends weren't happy about having me give it up.

KAREN	You okay?

CADE	Don't worry...

CADE	...about her. She's just fine.

KAREN	Let her go, Cade.

CADE	This sweet little lamb? I don't think I could bear doing that. She's just... cute enough to eat. So, why don't you put that scattergun down? 'Cause you're making those boys twitchy.

KAREN	Come to me, Ashley. Come on over here. We--

CADE	Don't!

CADE	This isn't something you can win, Karen. It's not a negotiation. There's nothing you can offer me that I couldn't just take from you.

KAREN	And what is it that you want, Cade?

CADE	I want my radio back.

CADE	You know, if it wasn't for you, I'd be...

CADE	...safe and sound with all the comforts at home right now.

KAREN	If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead in a hole in the ground where Pleasant Creek used to be!

CADE	Don't bet on it. I'll tell you one thing, I wouldn't be out here in the middle of nowhere with nothing to eat!

KAREN	If you're mad...

KAREN	...at me, take it out on me! Let the girl go!

CADE	It's not gonna happen. You took everything from me. And now I'm taking everything from you, and I do mean everything.

KAREN	You know you...

KAREN	...were wrong, Cade.

CADE	Wrong about what, Karen?

KAREN	Being a leader isn't about who's willing to take it the furthest...

KAREN	...or choosing the right path. It's about how far's too far, and knowing when to stop.

CADE	I'll write that in the marker we leave over your bones... after we lick them clean.

CADE	Damn. You were right.

KAREN	Come on. 

CADE	Come here, baby girl.

ASHLEY	I'm not a baby!

CADE	Ow! 

CADE	Damn little mongrel!

OSWALD	Hey! Hey!

CADE	Ah!

ASHLEY	Karen!

ASHLEY	Karen.

ASHLEY	Karen.

KAREN	Hey!

ERIN	Oh, thank God!

ERIN	We didn't think that they'd find you. They wouldn't let us go along.

KAREN	What is this? A military base? How did you find them?

ERIN	They found us.

VOGEL	Come here, Ashley.

ERIN	Hey.

VOGEL	Come on, let this nice lady take a look at you.

VOGEL	You can sit next to Mayor Wally.

WALLY	Sit right here.

ERIN	It's okay. They have to check us out before they let us in.

KAREN	In where? Who are "they"?

ERIN	They won't really say. 

FEMALE VOICE	Attention. Lockdown in two minutes.

ERIN	But it's "them". Just like Vince said. A New World Order. They've a...

ERIN	...bunker that goes down 20 stories.

KAREN	I don't care who they are, as long as we're safe. I could use some rule of law about now.

ERIN	So, we...

ERIN	...trade our freedom for security?

KAREN	Cade was right about one thing.

KAREN	You're a conspiracy nut.

ERIN	What was that acronym Cade used to use? Teo-toky or something?

KAREN	Then end of the world as we know it.

ERIN	I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

KAREN	It's gonna be a long winter.

FEMALE VOICE	Lockdown happening in one minute.
