(INHERITANCE)





JANINE	What lens are you on ?

MALE REPORTER	Can we get a camera set up over here ? Thank you Janine. I’m here at the New York County Courthouse, waiting for Lauren Monroe togive a statement to the press. Sir one moment, please.

JANINE	Juste set it up right over there. I’ll be right there.

LAUREN	Make sure we have full access to the SEC filings. Let’s get updated lits of shell compagnie ASAP as well. And keep having everyone comb for discrepancies in the shareholder reports. I need a meeting with Haevan at 2 :00. Please ! I can’t answer all your questions at once ! Okay, one at a time Katie, go ahead.

MALE REPORTER	What do you say to those who think that wall street has corrupted the justice system ?

LAUREN	Well, after my first year as district attorney, I’d say that my conviction rate speaks for itself. Victims and their familles have always been my only concern, not bankers and brokers.

HAEVAN	Beautiful morning, isn’t it, Lauren ?

LAUREN	Save your bullshit for the jury.

HAEVAN	It’s time we talk plea deal.

LAUREN	We did. I turne dit down.

FEMALE REPORTER	Ms. Monoroe, is it true that Thomas Reindorff’s legal team reached out with a plea deal ?

LAUREN	A plea deal without restitution for the 3.5 billion dollars he defrauded investors. Is no plea deal I would ever accept.

HAEVAN	There’s no way. You can prove my client was aware of or condoned the actions of a few rogue traitors.

LAUREN	Watch me. You can rest assured they’ll face their own day in court for collusion.

FEMALE EMCEE	Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hand together for District Attorney Lauren Monroe !

FEMALE REPORTER MCS	Your brother’s running for reelection to Congress with less than tend ays to go, A conviction would be very convenient in helping the family image.

LAUREN	Thank you, thank you. My brother has one thing no other opponent does : tenacity. Ladie and gentlement, my brother, Congressman William Monroe.  And as far as my brother’s reelection campaign goes, I’m sure he’d donate blood in exchange for your vote.

FEMALE REPORTER	Speakling of the election, is there any credence to the New York Post article that claims your brother traded favors in exchange for union support ?

LAUREN	Absolutely not. Desperation looks good on you, Robert.

HAEVAN	Your father would’ve told you to take the deal.

LAUREN	Your client is a socipathic liar that defrauded people of their pensions and life savings.

FEMALE REPORTER	We’re just now getting in word about your father’s accident.

LAUREN	I…

FEMALE REPORTER	We just received notice that he was found dead at your family’s summer house. Can you please comment on your father’s death, Miss Monroe ?

WILLIAM	Thank you, thank you. It’s an incredible honor to be here with you.

MALE REPORTER	Miss Monroe !

FEMALE REPORTER	Laurent ! One statement about your father !

EDDIE	That’ll be all for now. That’s enought ! Jackie, get them out of here !

MINISTER	Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

EMILIO	Hey, take care, okay ? Hey, listen, I gotta be back at the station at 4 :00, but I’m sorry for your loss, Lauren.

LAUREN	Thantks for all your help, Emilio.

EMILIO	Take care, okay ?

LAUREN	Thanks. You’re bette rat this than I am.

WILLIAM	Well, I had plenty of practice. You just nod and shake hands. A heart attack. I mean, how did that even happen ? Dad was in better shape than either of us.

LAUREN	What are we gonna do about Mom ?

WILLIAM	Just surround her with friends, And we’ll find her an apartment on Zillow, closer to us. Look, I can only stay until the reading of the will. Campaign’s a circus. Hey, Dad was proud of you.

LAUREN	Maybe in public, but we both know you were the golden child. Can’t believe it’s already been a week. It’s the beginning of the end. I know how to play the game.

ARCHER	This game, like life, requirest forethought. It’s not about where you are. It’s where you’ll be in ten moves or ten years. You are not allowed to be average. We all have to putup with things that we don’t like, so grow up, pick a firm, and learn how to win. Checkmate.

HAROLD	« I leave Catherine in sole control of the family estate and my voting rights on the board of directors. To my son, William, I leave the sum of 20 million. To Lauren, I leave 1 million. 50 millions is to be split equally between the Police and Firemen’s Benevolent Fund and the Harvard Shcool of Medicine. This is my last Will and Testament. Archer Monroe. »

CATHERINE	Thank you, Harold. That’ss be all. I need some air.

WILLIAM	Thank you, Harold.

LAUREN	Thank your for everything you’ve done for us, Harold. I know that you and my dad were close.

HAROLD	There’s actually… something I need to discuss with you. I knew your father for 31 years, Lauren. He was proud of the woman you became. Don’t let the inheritance speak otherwise.

LAUREN	Thank you. Okay.

ARCHER	Lauren, it pains me to do this, and if you have received this, it means that I never found the courage to tell you while I was alive or… I died before I handled it myself. And for that… for many things… forgive me. We’ve all made mistakes. This was mine. It is a secret you must carry to your grave. You are the eledst, and as such, I think you’ll understand why it had to be you. The answer lies buried near your fort. I must be vague in case of prying eyes, but above all things… the truth… must stay buried. Deepest apologies. Dad.

WILLIAM	Come on, Ted, how many years have we know each other ? There is absolutely no truth whatsoever in the Post article. Look, my family has always supported you in the…

SCOTT	Lauren, wait ! wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Are you okay ?

LAUREN	What else would I expect ?

SCOTT	Do you wanna talk about it ?

LAUREN	No, I just… I just want a moment by myself. I’m fine. I’m fine.

YOUNG LAUREN	You look very pretty today. Two sugar dubes ?

ARCHER	Lauren ! This is off-limits.

LAUREN	Jesus ! Okay, okay.

OPERATOR	911, what’s your emergency ? Hello, hello ?

LAUREN	Hello ?

OPERATOR	Ma’am, we just received a call from this number. Is everything all right ?

LAUREN	Yeah, sorry, um… my daughter was playing with my phone, so… I won’t let it happen again. I promise.

OPERATOR	Okay, ma’am, please be more careful in the future.

WILLIAM	Hey.

LAUREN	Hi.

WILLIAM	Listen, I don’t know why dad did that.

LAUREN	Sure you do.

WILLIAM	What’s  wrong with you ? You look awful.

LAUREN	Just got a little queasy on my walk.

WILLIAM	Okay. Let’s split it.

LAUREN	I really, really don’t care, Will, okay ? Seriously. Use it for your campaiçgn or something.

WILLIAM	I hope I still have your vote.

LAUREN	Well, that depends on your policies. Weren’t you supposed to be gone already ?

WILLIAM	Yeah, actually, but you try- pulling Mom away fro mher favorite granddaughter. Lose a hand.

CATHERINE	Oh. We built a beautiful life together, didn’t we ?  Wha’s wrong ?

LAUREN	It’s everything, honestly.

CATHERINE	You father was proud of you. Even when he didn’t show it, he was proud of you.

LAUREN	I know there’s gonna be blood in the water, and the press are gonna be digging, pointing their spotlight on all of us. Are there any old enemies of Dad’s that I should be aware of ?

CATHERINE	We both know he was no saint, but that is not your burden to carry. It’s mine.

LAUREN	Well, I should know. Maybe I can help.

CATHERINE	You wanna help ? Crucify Reindorff. Win that case and help your family win reelection.

LAUREN	Good night, Claire-Bear. I love you.

CLAIRE	I love you too, mama.

SCOTT	Sure you don’t want us to stay ?

LAUREN	No, I just need some time to think. But I’ll see your guys tomorrow night. I love you.

SCOTT	Love you.

ARCHER	All finest schools, most prestigious firms require…

LAUREN	I don’t want to represent your rich friends ! Why is that so wrong ?

ARCHER	You are throwing it all away to be a civil servant, just like your boyfriend.

LAUREN	Fiancé.

CATHERINE	Okay, that’s enough, both of you.

ARCHER	Talk to your daughter.

CATHERINE	You’re acting like this is some kind of prison sentence.

LAUREN	It is. Hey ! Can you hear me ? Hey ! Oh, shoot ! Shit. Shit.

MORGAN	Nice mask.

LAUREN	Who are you ?

MORGAN	I like masks.

LAUREN	Answer the question.

MORGAN	Where’s Archer ?

LAUREN	Tell me your name.

MORGAN	John.

LAUREN	John what ?

MORGAN	Doe.

LAUREN	You think this is a game ? You’re chained up in a bunker, and I wanna know why.

MORGAN	Show me your face, Lauren Elizabeth Monroe. You want answers ? Look me in the eye and ask. Born november 7th, 1989. You have a younger brother, William. As DA you advocate for the innocent and downtrodden to appease your conscience for being born into wealth and because you knew your father would disapprove. You used to bite your nails incessantly, unless, of course, you’ve kicked that habit. You have a daughter, Claire, a husband, Scott, who you married against your father’s wishes. Should I continue, or will you take off that ridiculous mask ? It’s good to finally meet you.

LAUREN	Who are you.

MORGAN	I’d like to think I’m a member of the family after all these years.

LAUREN	What do you mean, years ?

MORGAN	Exactly that. Years. So tell me, what happened to your dad ? Oh. How’d he die ? My condolences. So he left me to you. That’s quite the inheritance.

LAUREN	So explain yourself. A man in your position, only bad things come to mind.

MORGAN	Are you good, Lauren ?

LAUREN	Who else knows you’re here ?

MORGAN	Answer the question. Are you a good person ?

LAUREN	I’d like to think so.

MORGAN	Then let me go. It’s what a good person would do.

LAUREN	You know it’s not that simple.

MORGAN	Your needs ? your needs ? You wanna know my name ? You want the truth ? Well, I want the juiciest steak on God’s green Earth. Rare. Baked potato, all the fixings. I want a Caesar salad, bread and butter, packet of Fauloises cigarettes, some chocolate, a newspaper, and a 30 year old bottle of scotch, aged for every year of my captivity. You give me what I asked for, and I will tell you everything.

LAUREN	I need answers.

MORGAN	And I need a steak. And while we’re at it, I want a shave. I wanna feel more like a human being again. Now, we both know your conscience, though pained, is not gonna just let me go, not yet. But when all si said and done, you will know the truth, and you will set me free. 

LAUREN	You’re really gonna play it that way ? Look around. You’re the one in chains. I could just let you rot in here, close the door and walk away.

MORGAN	But you won’t.

LAUREN	You really wanna risk that for a steak ?

MORGAN	Wait. I’d also really like a slice of key lime pie. And I would appreciate that shave. C-Can I have the light a little longer ? Your father would only leave it on an hour or so after he left.

EMILIO	This is Detective Emilio Sanchez, 75th Precinct. Leave me a message, and I’ll come back to you as soon as I can.

LAUREN	Sanchez, hey, it’s me. I just emailed you a set of prints. I need you to get into the system ASAP. Call me on my cell. Bye. Hey honey. Sorry. Couldn’t connect to you for some reason.

SCOTT	Hey, how was last night ?

LAUREN	Good, yead. I was just going through some of Dad’s old things.

SCOTT	You wanna talk about it ?

LAUREN	Maybe tonight. I’m actually headed into court right now, so…

SCOTT	Already here. Don’t forget. Claire’s forget. Claire’s recital this afternoon.

LAUREN	Yeah, okay. Well, I love you.

SCOTT	Love you.

LAUREN	Bye.

MORGAN	Ohh… God help me if that isn’t the finest thing I’ve ever smelled.

LAUREN	I brought you your food, so let’s talk.

MORGAN	And talk we will. But first… mmm ! Mmm. You can’t imagine what this means to me. Thank you.

LAUREN	What happened between you and my dad ?

MORGAN	You’re not like him. I suspect you’re better than he ever was.

LAUREN	You’ve been deflecting my questions ever since I got here.

MORGAN	How’s Catherine taking this ? She was always such a beautiful woman.

LAUREN	My family is off-limits.

MORGAN	A lawyer, a banker, and a politician. The unholy trinity. Quite the family.

LAUREN	When I get back, you’re going to tell me the truth, or it’s the last time you’ll see me.

EDDIE	Lauren, where the hell are you ?

LAUREN	Eddie, I’m gonna be late for court.

EDDIE	I’m sorry, but of all the days to be late ?

LAUREN	Yea, I know. Look, I need you to run the trial.

EDDIE	Haevan is gonna eat me alive.

LAUREN	You’re going to be fine. And don ‘t let Robert toss the SEC filing on…

EDDIE	I know about the SEC files.

LAUREN	I’ll be there soon.

EDDIE	Lauren, Lauren…

MORGAN	1-1/2 cup of finely crushed Graham crackers, one-third of a cup of butter or margarine, three tablespoons of sugar, a cn of sweetened condensed milk,  one-half cup of key lime juice, one containe of whipped topping.

LAUREN	Let’s have some answers.

MORGAN	Forgive me. I just… once a year, Christmas, your father would bring me chocolate. Not a whole bar, just a little tiny square. It was my one treat for the year, then he’d put it up there for the rest of the year to taunt me, along with the pictures he took.

LAUREN	Pictures ?

MORGAN	In the cigar box.

LAUREN	What is this ?

MORGAN	It’s my life. You, uh… you want some ?

LAUREN	It’s all yours.

MORGAN	My name is Morgan. Morgan Warner. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. It’s been a long time since I had any human contact. You know, just to touch someone’s skin. I used to smoke Gauloises cigarettes back in the day. It was a habit I picked up because I thought it would make me appear more refined.

LAUREN	Get to the point.

MORGAN	I was a foolish young man when I met your father. We had similar vices. Gambling, ego, women. That was the greatest time of my life. We became partners. Archer was fearless, but he couldn’t read people. He was so young and careless back then.

LAUREN	So you helped him become a card shark ?

MORGAN	Oh, no, he was already a shark. I just provided an edge. If there’s one thing your father wanted in business, cards, politics, it was an edge.

LAUREN	What happened between you ?

MORGAN	I was gonna become a doctor. I could’ve done so much with my life. That night…

LAUREN	What happened ?

MORGAN	We’d had a few drinks before leaving the summer house for a big game in the city. We should never have been on the road. I’ll never forget that sound. It happened so fast. My heart was pounding like i twas gonna burst in my chest. And my mouth, I could barely swallow, I was so scared. He was just a kid. He was like us. I figuèred the only thing we could do was call the police and, you know, say there had been an accident. But, uh, he panicked. He said we couldn’t. He said the cops would be looking for his dented car. He said he’d go to jail, that he’d lose everything. « If there’s no body, there’s no crime. If there’s no body, there’s no crime. » He Kept saying it over and over again. « If there’s no body, htere’s no crime. » I-I tried to do the right thing.

LAUREN	My dad killed a man ?

MORGAN	It was an accident. But paranoia infected him.

LAUREN	What happened to the body ?

MORGAN	We buried it. That is to say, your father buried it. I wanted no part of it. I wasn’t about to cover up a homicide. You know, I mean, an accident is one thing, but… maybe I should have. Maybe I’d still have a life.

ARCHER	Morgan !

LAUREN	Who was he ?

MORGAN	I don’t know

LAUREN	You buried a body and didn’t even bother to find out who i twas ?

MORGAN	I had slightly more pressing matters at hand. What would you have done ? Would you have buried him and walked away, or would you have made the call to the police ?

LAUREN	Id’like to think I’d make the call.

MORGAN	Well, then you would be here  like me.

LAUREN	Why to all this trouble ?

MORGAN	Why not just kill me ? I begged him to. Days turned into weeks then months, then so much time had gone by, he couldn’t bring himself to let me go. He was scared I’d turne him in. I wouldn’t have said a word. Not a word… If it’d have bought me my freedom. If Archer had a conscience, he would’ve just put me out of my misery. Instead, he offered me the chance to kill myself. But no matter the agony, the hopelessness, my life had meaning. My survival would be my revenge.

LAUREN	But people must have missed you, looked for you.

ARCHER	He said I stole his winnings, left the country.

LAUREN	How do i know that you’re telling me the truth ? It’s not like my dad’s here do defend himself.

MORGAN	I said your father had three vices. Poker, obviously, ego, of course, but we haven’t even begun to discuss the women. One woman in particular.

LAUREN	What does it have to do with anything ?

MORGAN	You said you could handle the truth. Archer loved your mother, but, uh, Sofia… she was everything your mother was not. Uncomplicated, unrestrained, free from conformity. Sofia wasn’t an affaire. She was an obsession, providing for Archer’s darker appetites. He used to call her his Gypsy Rose. You must have had some kind of inclination…

LAUREN	I don’t believe you.

MORGAN	Why not ? SInce the world has turned, powerful men have kept mistresses, and he kept her till his dying day.

LAUREN	He wouldn’t do that to my mom.

MORGAN	Does any daughter really know her father ?

LAUREN	You’re lying.

MORGAN	Look, I don’t expect you to take my word for it, okay ? Why don’t you go check ?

LAUREN	How ?

MORGAN	He used to visit her every Tuesday, 72nd and Parkway. Her name is Sofia Fiore.

LAUREN	Bullshit.

MORGAN	If you don’t believe me, go ask Harold. I’m sure he kept an entirely separate inheritance for her. She was the love of his life.

LAUREN	Shut the hell up ! If you’re lying, I swear you’ll never see me again. Can you check to see if here were any missing persons named Morgan Warner during the late ‘80s ?

EMILIO	Morgan Warner, yeah, okay. What’s it for ?

LAUREN	My dad left him something in his will, and i’m trying to find out what happened to him. No emails. Just forward whatever you find on to my parent’s summer house.

EMILIO	All right.

JUDGE	Well, I’m glad you decided to join us, Ms Monroe.

LAUREN	May it please the court, I’d like to oeffer my sincere apology to your honor and the ladies and gentlemen of the jury. What did I miss ?

EDDIE	Besides the birth of my 15 ulcers ?

JUDGE	Court is in session. Mr Haevan, please call your next witness.

MORGAN	1-1/2 cups of finely crushed Graham crackers, one-third of a cup of butter, three tablespoons of sugar, one can of sweetened condensed milk, one-half cup of key lime juice, one container of whipped topping. Prehat oven to 350 degrees. Press into baking tray. Bake for eight to 10 minutes. Leave to cool. 1-1/2 cups of finely crushed Graham crackers, one-third of a cup of butter, three tablespoons of sugar, one can of sweetened condensed milk, one-half cup of key lime juice, one containers of whipped topping. Beat milk and lime juice together until thick and smooth, fold in whipped topping, spoon into cool pie crust, cover and refigerate for one hour or till set.

DOORMAN	Can I help you ?

LAUREN	I’m here to see Sofia Fiore.

DOORMAN	Your name, please ?

LAUREN	Lauren Monroe.

DOORMAN	One moment, please. I have Lauren Monroe here to see you, ma’am. Yes, ma’am.

LAUREN	Sofia Fiore ?

SOFIA	Please come in, Lauren. Why are you here ?

LAUREN	I found your name in my dad’s will. Maybe you can tell me how you two met.

SOFIA	Do you really wanna know ?

LAUREN	Yes.

SOFIA	At a poker game.

LAUREN	And you were together for…

SOFIA	He never stopped loving your mother, if that’s what you mean.

LAUREN	How long ?

SOFIA	Many years.

LAUREN	I wish I didn’t have to be here, but I’m just trying to put the pieces together. So I apologize for asking, but did my dad ever pay you for your company ?

SOFIA	We took care of each other. That care helped me earn a master’s and a career. How we started is not where we ended up.

LAUREN	Who is this ?

SOFIA	My son. Alex. Your half-brother.

LAUREN	Jesus Christ. No… No one can know. This would literally kill my mom.

SOFIA	Lauren, you came to me. We have our own life.

LAUREN	And your son ?

SOFIA	He doesn’t know you exist.

LAUREN	I have to go.

HAROLD	Mmm right.

LAUREN	Even for a lawyer, Harold, you’re a goddamn snake in the grass.

HAROLD	Let me call you back. Lauren, what the hell is going on ?

LAUREN	Sofia Fiore.

HAROLD	What about her ?

LAUREN	All these years, you knew. Every family gathering, you lied to our faces. To my mom’s face.

HAROLD	I’m your father’s lawyer, Lauren.

LAUREN	And his friend.

HAROLD	And as both, it wasn’t my business to do either. You don’t think I didn’t try to talk some sense into him ?

LAUREN	What am I supposed to do ?

HAROLD	Walk away.

LAUREN	And if someone finds out ?

HAROLD	She won’t say a word. She never has. She signed a nondisclosure agreement.

LAUREN	Of cours. How much ?

HAROLD	Does it matter ?

LAUREN	How much ? What else was my dad hiding ?

HAROLD	This is it.

LAUREN	He’s dead, Harold ! He’s… he’s dead. My mom, my brother’s career, my career. I… I neded to know if there are more skeletons.

HAROLD	Nothing that can harm you.

LAUREN	What does that mean ?

HAROLD	It means… Walk away. I’ve protected your family for decades. I know things I’ll take to te grave. Your father trusted me, Lauren, I suggest your do the same.

LAUREN	Did my dad ever mention a man named Morgan Warner to you ?

HAROLD	Doesn’t sound familiar.

LAUREN	I’d like you to help me find some stats, old guarantees. Also the research.

JEN	Got it.

LAUREN	Thanks, Jen.

JEN	Of cours.

LAUREN	Hey, mom.

CATHERINE	What a welcome surprise. You’ve come to join the war effort ? Ay.

LAUREN	You know, they have  speechwriter for that.

CATHERINE	Yea, well, we can’t afford to make the slightest mistake. Not now. Not after all this hard work. How’s your case ?

LAUREN	It’s good.

CATHERINE	You know, that case makes me miss being a lawyer.

LAUREN	Listen, I was going through some of dad’s old things. Some guy named Morgan Warner, does that name ring a bell ?

CATHERINE	Morgan ? I don’t think so.

LAUREN	Oh, I just thought that maybe I could get to know dad better through old friends.

CATHERINE	That teminds me. I have something for you. I will not let money tear this family apart. You deserve the same as your brother.

LAUREN	I don’t want it. I never did.

CATHERINE	Your father had no right to do what he did.

WILLIAM	I don’t care you have to do. Just get it done. I’ms surrounded by jackals. Hi.

LAUREN	What’s going on ?

WILLIAM	Well, we got a sympathy bump in the polls, police and firemen’s unions are backing us, thanks to dad’s donation, but my lead is within the margin of error. Some polls say I’ms slipping. Goddamn New York Post article saying I paid off union reps isn’t exactly helping perception.

LAUREN	You didn’t, right ?

WILLIAM	Of course not. It’s a semar campaign. But, Lauren, Listen. I need you at the rally tomorrow night. Just give a short speech, shake some hands, kiss a few babies…

LAUREN	It’s the worst time. With the Reindorff case, I’m barely staying afloat.

WILLIAM	I know, but look, it’s all hands on deck right now, okay ? Mom will be there, the mayor. I need my sister to get up there, flash that beautiful smile and help us win this thing.

LAUREN	I’ll be there.

CATHERINE	Thank you, honey.

WILLIAM	Thank you.

LAUREN	Why didn’t you tell me he had a son ?

MORGAN	And ruin the surprise ? How is Alex ?

LAUREN	This isn’t funny.

MORGAN	No. But it’s proof. What do you say we take this off now ?

LAUREN	What else, hmm ? What else do you know ?

MORGAN	Everything. I was your father’s confessor. I mean, I hated the man, yet I lived vicariously through him. Each convresation was, uh… all I had. Look, I know this is a lot to swallow, but truth is, Archer only ever looked out for Archer. He was a bad husband, he’s a shitty father, and a worse friend. If it’s any consolation, he admired you for the mother you’ve become.

LAUREN	I was a good parent because he wasn’t.

MORGAN	It must have been hard.

LAUREN	What ?

MORGAN	Trying to please him, rebel against him at the same time.

LAUREN	How do I know you’re telling the truth about the body ?

MORGAN	Di git up.

LAUREN	Where’s it buried ?

MORGAN	I couldn’t possibly describe that to you after all this time.

LAUREN	Try.

MORGAN	The only way is to take me there.

LAUREN	If you think that I’m gonna let you…

MORGAN	You’re a lawyer. You know the sentence for aiding and abetting a kidnapping, for false imprisonment, for torture, duress ?

LAUREN	I know the law.

MORGAN	Yead.

LAUREN	No more games. Tell me the truth.

MORGAN	I told you the truth about Sofia. I want my freedom, Lauren. I’ve earned it.

LAUREN	Doesn’t mean that you’re not lying about this.

MORGAN	Take me there. Dig up the truth.

LAUREN	If you try something…

MORGAN	I am an old man now. It’s been such a long time since I’ve seen the outside world, it’s probably gonna give me a heart attack. Ah…

LAUREN	Move !

MORGAN	It’s more beautiful than I remember. Oh God. It’s almost too painful to bear. Thank you.

LAUREN	Come on.

MORGAN	I just… I took so much for granted, you know. Just the trees and the… the night sky, fresh air.

LAUREN	God. Let’s go, come on.

MORGAN	Yea, right, sorry.

LAUREN	Let’s go.

MORGAN	Yeah.

LAUREN	I’m gonna take this call. You’re not gonna say one word. You’re not even gonna breathe, do you understand me ? Not one word. Hey, I’ve been meaning to call you.

SCOTT	Where are you ? You haven’t returned my calls or texts. I left messages at your office.

LAUREN	It’s… it’s been a horrible day. I’m sorry. I should have reached…

SCOTT	You can’t just vanish on me like this. You remember Claire’s recital, the one you promised you wouldn’t miss ? It’s a huge ordeal to get her to go to bed because you didn’t call back, you didn’t say sorry, you didn’t say good night.

LAUREN	Yeah, look, I know. I… I total… i’m sorry. I promise I’ll make it up to you guys, okay ?

SCOTT	Your voice sounds like…

LAUREN	Look, I can’t talk right now !

MORGAN	Trouble at home ? I’m sure Scott’s just missing you.

LAUREN	Goddam nit, do not talk about my family. You wanna end up back in that hole ? No ? Then shut up.

MORGAN	Okay.

LAUREN	Move.

MORGAN	All right.

LAUREN	I feel like we’re driving in circles.

MORGAN	We’re almost there. Just keep going straight. Oh oh here. Tun down here. There, just to the right. Right, right, right.

LAUREN	How far ?

MORGAN	Just keep going.

LAUREN	For how long ?

MORGAN	Do you want answers or not ? We’re close. We4re almost there, I’m telling ya. Oh, stop. Stop the car.

LAUREN	Take this. Morgan. Morgan !

MORGAN	There. That’s where we buried him.

LAUREN	Sit over there and keep lying on the ground. You move, I shoot. It’s that simple.

MORGAN	You sure you don’t want me to dig ? Your dad did.

LAUREN	I prefer you in cuffs.

MORGAN	Suit yourself. When you find the body… 

LAUREN	If !

MORGAN	When you find the body…

LAUREN	Shut up ! I mea nit.

MORGAN	All right.

LAUREN	There’s nothing here.

MORGAN	Oh, he’s there.

LAUREN	Where, huh ? Where ? Okay, this is all some bullshit lie. Whe’re in the middle of fucking nowhere.

MORGAN	Please, just trust me.

LAUREN	How can I trust you ? I don’t even know you, okay ? I’m already out on a fucking lim, trying… Light. Jesus Christ.

MORGAN	Told ya.

LAUREN	Shut up !

MORGAN	So what happens now ?

LAUREN	Put the collar back on.

MORGAN	W… We found the body.

LAUREN	I need to think.

MORGAN	About what ? I’m… I’m innocent.

LAUREN	It’s not that black or white.

MORGAN	I see, I see. Even now you are protecting your father.

LAUREN	Not my father, my family.

MORGAN	What about justice ? Isn’t that why you became a lawyer ? What… what about everything I’ve lost ? What about my mother, huh ? Her son just vanishes off the face of the Earth ? No closure ? Not even a funeral ? It’s just there’s no love or compassion, not even a window to see the sun. Every day protein powder, peanut butter, and water. Could you live like that ?! Could you ? Days that last as long as years ! Nothing to celebrate ! Just one fucking piece of chocolate every Christmas !

LAUREN	What do you want me to say ? I didn’t do this to you !

MORGAN	But you could change it ! If you walk away, you’re worse than he is. Will you be able to look into Scott’s eyes ? Or Claire’s ? Or yours ?

LAUREN	Put it back on !

MORGAN	I am innocent man. You give me my life back.

LAUREN	Put it on !

MORGAN	All right, all right.

LAUREN	Put it on ! This is not my responsibility, do you understand me ? I didn’t ask for this. This is nhot my fault. You think just because you show me a body, and you told me about his mistress that that means I believe you, and I trust you ? It doesn’t prove anything. It doesn’t prove anything !

MORGAN	It proves everything ! Come on.

LAUREN	Il need more.

MORGAN	What do you want from me ? Do you want me to just conjure evidence ? Your father erased every trace of my existence !

LAUREN	You gotta give me something else.

MORGAN	I can’t ! I can’t ! Goddam nit ! You’re just like your father. You offer false hope, and then you just take it all away. God knows how many good years I’ve got, Lauren. Just, please, let me have them. Oh, God. All right. Look, I know what you’re thinking, okay ? And I understand. « If I set him free, is he gonna go to the cops or the media ? Is he gonna destroy my family name ? My brother’s political career ? My career ? Am I gonna break your mother’s heart ? » I swear, I swear I will just, I will vanish. I just wanna salvage what few years I have left. Please, please, Lauren. Be a good person. I beg you. I beg you. Thank you. Thank you.

LAUREN	I’m… I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

MORGAN	No. Lauren !

LAUREN	Pick up, pick up ! All you two care about is money and legacy. I know that it’s late, but i really need that missing persons information ASAP. What’s going on with that ?

EMILIO	I don’t have it yet.

MORGAN	Show me your face.

ARCHER	Privilege is not given. It’s earned. 

LAUREN	I know exactly the kind of perso nit takes to earn your privilege.

MORGAN	A lawyer, a banker, and a politician.

EMILIO	It’s in a warehouse in Queens.

LAUREN	Fuck.

MORGAN	The unholy trinity. I want my freedom.

LAUREN	Send the hard copy file to the Monroe manor. Dad, say something.

ARCHER	Close the door on your way out. It is protected. It has a price.

MORGAN	Quite the family.

ARCHER	Chekmate.

LAUREN	I’ms so sorry, Claire-bear. I love you.

CLAIRE	I love you too, Mommy.

REPORTER	The congressional race is in  a dead heat. With only two days to go, each candidate is pulling out all the stops. Incumbent William Monroe is trying to lock down his second term in the face of allegations that his campaign has been trading favors for union vo…

LAUREN	Bring me up to speed before we begin.

EDDIE	Here’s the updated list of shell companies from forensic accounting.

LAUREN	Give me the highlights.

BAILIFF	All rise !

JUDGE	Please be seated.

HAEVAN	To be very clear for the jury, confirm how many traders worked on behalf of their clients, in full control of their own accounts outside of Mr. Reindorff’s direct supervision ? And how many trades a day were completed on average by these 324 traders ?

MALE WITNESS	Around 2500.

HAEVEN	2500 trades a day ?

MALE WITNESS	That’s correct.

HAEVEN	I further put it to you that Ms. Monroe, desperate to step out of her late father’s shoes… She’s dragging my client’s impeccable reputation through the mud. The state souhld be ashamed of her.

JUDGE	Your witness, Ms.Monroe. Ms Monroe ? ms Monroe !

LAUREN	No questions, your Honor.

JUDGE	In  that case, this court is adjourned until 9 a.m tomorrow morning. The witness is free to step down.

LAUREN	I’ll call you later.

HAROLD	You don’t call ahead anymore ?

LAUREN	Did you set up the account ?

HAROLD	What is this ?

LAUREN	Gypsy Rose, LLC.

HAROLD	I’m note at liberty…

LAUREN	Stop ! I don’t wanna hear it. I can’t hear it. This is a major conflict of interest ! My own father is a co-conspirator in my goddamn case.

HAROLD	Lauren…

LAUREN	Jesus Christ, Harold ! I asked you if there was anything else that could hurt us, and you said no. You said…

HAROLD	Stop asking questions you don’t want answers to ! Lauren, ignorance is deniability, so walk away. I don’t know anything about Gypsy Rose, and neither do you.

WILLIAM	Just get that proposal on my desk and set up a meeting with the labor board, please. No later than Friday. Hey, what are you doing here ? Is everything okay ?

LAUREN	Yeah, I, um… I just needed some advice.

WILLIAM	About the Reindorff case ?

LAUREN	No, I have a legal situation I need to talk through.

WIILIAM	Oh, okay, well, hit me.

LAUREN	The details are complicated, but the gist is this. A guy has blackmail material that could ruin your life, ruin your family’s life, destroy everything you’ve built. He just needs some money to start a new life.

WILLIAM	Whatever it takes. Family comes first.

LAUREN	Before a clear conscience ?

WILLIAM	Well, yeah, in our business, that’s rarer than the virgin birth. Okay, say I’m that guy. What did I do ?

LAUREN	Hypothetically ?

WILLIAM	Hypothetically.

LAUREN	Okay. Well, you know the guy killed a man, and you are threatening to expose him.

WILLIAM	Just plead him out or walk away. It’s not like you’re ever gonna run out of cases to try. Okay. Look, all I know is, if someone was threatening our family, I’d either pay him off or dump his body in the river. And you know what Dad would’ve done.

MORGAN	Have you made your decision ? Lauren… please.

LAUREN	I wanna do the right thing. I really do.

MORGAN	But ?

LAUREN	But how do I know that you’re telling the truth ?

MORGAN	I showed you the body.

LAUREN	The truth about vanishing.

MORGAN	I have been imprisoned in this room for longer than you have been alive. If I walk out that door, I will never, ever look back.

LAUREN	I have your word ?

MORGAN	I swear.

LAUREN	Clean up. You’re leaving tonight.

HAROLD	Why are we meeting here ?

LAUREN	We have a situation.

HAROLD	What happened ?

LAUREN	My father happened.

HAROLD	I told you, Sofia isn’t a concern. And that other issue…

LAUREN	I need you to set up a Cayman Island account. You’re good at that. Put my one million in it, and I need 100K in cash.

HAROLD	Who’s this for ?

LAUREN	A man my dad wronged. In addition, I need an ID, fake or otherwise, and I need to charter a jet to fly him there. Make sure none of this is traceable back to us.

HAROLD	Hey, hold on, hold on. I’ve done plenty of shady things in my life, but I always knew the reason. Give me a reason.

LAUREN	You don’t wanna know.

HAROLD	On a scale of one to 10.

LAUREN	Apocalyptic.

HAROLD	Who else knows about this ? William ? Catherine ?

LAUREN	No one else knows. I need it done ASAP. I have to get this man as far away from us as possible. 

HAROLD	What did Archer do…

LAUREN	I can’t tell you ! I can’t tell anyone.

HAROLD	Lauren, are you sure you wanna do this ? That’s a lot of loose ends.

LAUREN	I don’t have a choice ! Call me when it’s set.

MORGAN	I feel like a new man.

LAUREN	You look… different.

MORGAN	I will take that as the compliment. I’ms sure i twas gudgingly meant to be.

LAUREN	When you talked, um… what did my dad say about me ?

MORGAN	What do you mean ?

LAUREN	Well, you said that you were his confessor, so… so what did he say ?

MORGAN	He was proud of you.

LAUREN	The truth.

MORGAN	He thought you sould be in the private sector as a litigator, protecting the family interests. A city attorney lacked prestige. Then when you made DA he thought you were humiliating him by going after his friends. But he loved you… in his way. And he would read me every story when you had some trial in the news. I think after a time, he began to change his mind about things.

LAUREN	Thought that I would make him proud if I became DA, but, you know.

MORGAN	Least you didn’t have to pay off the unions for support.

LAUREN	That’s a smear campaign. My brother didn’t do that.

MORGAN	I’m sure Jeffrey Shultz would disagree, if he isn’t already lying in a ditch somewhere.

LAUREN	Who’s Jeffrey Shultz ?

WILLIAM	Can you just keep me updated on the polls as they come through, point-for-point ? That’d be great.

MORGAN	1-1/2 cups of finely crushed Graham crackers. Three tablespoons of sugar. One can of sweetened condensed milk.

WILLIAM	Oh, and I need the most recent draft of my speech within the hour to make the edits. Thank you.

MORGAN	One-third of a cup of butter or margarine. Three tablespoons of sugar. One-third of a cup of butter or margarine. Three tablespoons of sugar. One can of sweetened condensed milk.

WILLIAM	Oh, hey. I’m glad you’re here. I wanted to ask you if you…

LAUREN	We need to talk. In private.

WILLIAM	Yeah, okay. Uh, guys, can we get a minute ? Thank you. What’s wrong ?

LAUREN	Jeffrey Shultz. Does that name sound familiar ?

WILLIAM	No. Why ?

LAUREN	Oh, save the bullshit ! That article, it’s legit, isn’t it ? You and dad cut a deal for the votes and used Jeffrey Shultz as the middleman to pay union reps ?

WILLIAM	They can’t prove it.

LAUREN	Oh, Jesus Christ. What the hell were you thinking ?

WILLIAM	Oh, stop with the choir girl act, Lauren ! Don’t play dumb ! You know how this works. You think anyone gets elected without cutting deals ?

LAUREN	It’s bribery ! You and dad were lying to me. How many ? For how long, huh ? Why didn’t I know ?

WILLIAM	‘Cause you’re the district attorney of Manhattan.

LAUREN	I’m your sister !

WILLIAM	We were protecting you. Would you really have wanted to know ? Honestly. Do you even know the position that would’ve put you in ?

LAUREN	I wouldn’t have liked it, but I would have protected you. I am protecting you.

WILLIAM	Yeah ? Who’d you talk to ?

LAUREN	It doesn’t matter.

WILLIAM	Oh the hell it doesn’t. How do you think you got elected as the DA ? Because I can assure you, it wasn’t your…

LAUREN	Shut up ! Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare ever lie to me again ! Are you ready ?

MORGAN	With every fiber of my being. I can’t wait to see the sunrise, feel it on my face.

LAUREN	You’ll have all the sun you want in the Caymans. It’s paradise.

MORGAN	Harold, right ?

LAUREN	He’ll help you set up a new life. You can make up for lost time.

MORGAN	This might sound a little strange, but, um… this is one of the things that really kept me going. I promised myself that if one day I got free, i’d, um… have myself a slice of key lime pie, like the one in the picture.

LAUREN	I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve this.

MORGAN	You’re good person, Lauren. Thank you.

LAUREN	Morgan, just one last thing. If you ever come back, if you ever say a word, I will pin every cold case for the last 30 years on you. I will make you wish you were back in the hole my dad kept you in. Are we clear ?

MORGAN	Hey, my name’s…

HAROLD	No names. Here are your new IDs, 100,000 in cash and an account number with 1 million. Let’s go.

EMILIO	Lauren, this is Sanchez. I found that missing person file you needed. Those fingerprints came back with a match. I’m sending it all up to the summer house now. Call me.

CATHERINE	Thank you, Tom. Lauren ?

LAUREN	Shit ! Shit ! Mom ? Mom ! Mom ! Mom, what are you doing ?

CATHERINE	What is this ?

LAUREN	It’s nothing. It’s just a work thing.

CATHERINE	Why do you have pictures of this man ?

LAUREN	Why are you asking about Morgan ?

CATHERINE	Morgan ? This man’s name is Carson.

LAUREN	No, it’s… it’s Morgan. That’s Morgan !

CATHERINE	His name is Carson.

LAUREN	I… I don’t understand. That’s… what’s going on ? Do you know him ?

CATHERINE	Why do you have any of this ?

LAUREN	This man. This man said his name was Morgan. And that dad’s kept this man chained up in a bunker in our backyard ! In our backyard, okay ? This, this is my fucking inheritance, Mom !

CATHERINE	This man is evil. He’s… he’s pure evil.

LAUREN	What ?

CATHERINE	Where is he now ? where is he ?

LAUREN	I… I let him go. I let him go. I… I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was doing the right thing, mom ! I called Harold, and I …

CATHERINE	Oh, my God…

LAUREN	You lock the doors. I’ll handle this. I’ll handle it.

HAROLD	This is Harold Thewlis. I’m unavailable right now. Please leave a message, and I’ll get back to you.

LAUREN	Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Mom, pick up, pick up.

CATHERINE	Hey there, you know what to do.

LAUREN	Mom, get out of the house now ! He’s there ! He’s there, he’s there ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom. Mom, can you hear me ? Mom, we have to get out of here, Mom. Mom, we have to get out of here, mom. Come on. Mom ! Mom, can you hear me ? Mom, we have to get out of here. Please, you have to get up.

MORGAN	Lauren.

LAUREN	Shit.

MORGAN	Lauren. Lauren ! You would be amazed… at how well your eyes and ears adjust after years in near total darkness. I can hear your heartbeat. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump ! 1-1/2 cups of finely crushed Graham crackers, three tablespoons of sugar. 1-1/2 cup of finely crushed Graham crackers. One-third of a cup of butter or margarine. Three tablespoons of sugar. Hey there, sleepy head. Parting was unbearable. I really didn’t wanna start without you, but your mother insisted.

LAUREN	I swear to God, I’ll tear your heart out.

MORGAN	I’m kinda sorry that it’s not your dad there in chains. It took me so long to get my hands on him, you know ? All my little traps finally worked to perfection. I took some of the poison he got to kill me, I jammed it in his dans when we’re playing chess. Checkmate. I got my rat. Then the slippery bastard got away, and I was like « Oh , fuck ! » And just when all hope seemed to bel ost… imagine my surprise when you walked in. I knew the moment I saw ya. That little girl takes in stray dogs. She’s gonna do the same for me. I just… I just needed to act weak… and helpless. Your brother would’ve thrown away the key. Hey ! Look who it is. Should we invite your mother into this conversation ?  Let’s do it.

LAUREN	No !

MORGAN	Hey, hey, hey, hey.

LAUREN	No, leave her.

MORGAN	Hey, I just wanna say, I really did enjoy our time together, even though i twas under false pretenses. Catherine ! Can you hear me, sweetheart ?

LAUREN	No I get away from her !

MORGAN	Get you up. Let’s get up. There you go ! The floor’s cold, come on.

LAUREN	This is between you… You and me.

MORGAN	That is where you’re wrong. You really think your perfect life is built on integrity ? You’re the monster, Catherine. You just live in a nicer house.

LAUREN	Don’t you touch her !

MORGAN	Okay, okay, okay ! We’re just getting to the bit where you come in. See, back in the day, your mom, she was a tight little thing. Whoa ! Gross. Catherine, tell her about that night. Come on. Tell her all about that special night. You’re gonna love this. Tell her !

CATHERINE	Fuck you !

MORGAN	Whoa, whoa ! That was close. All right, I’ll tell her. It was what I used to call my ace in the hole. That night, I wanted the full tour. Oh come on ! Don’t you give me that look. I know you wanted it as much as I did. You just didn’t want to let yourself have it.

CATHERINE	You’re a rapist.

MORGAN	I mean… semantics, you know ?

CATHERINE	You sould be dead.

MORGAN	I should be dead. I should be a lot of things.

CATHERINE	Carson, Carson.

MORGAN	Why…

YOUG MORGAN	She’s fucking lying !

MORGAN	Coul you not just lie to your husband like a normal fucking wife ?! You know, he didn’t even give me the chance to talk my way out of it. And then that sound. It’s like hitting a deer, except you can’t leave that on the side of the road. That moment, I owned him. And he know it. « Rich playboy… drunk at the wheel… kills promising young student. » Come on ! The headlines, they wrote themselves ! I was gonna bleed him dry, and there was nothing he could do about it. Almots nothing

ARCHER	Carson !

MORGAN	I gotta say… I didn’t realize he ha dit in him. I mean, I am a bad man, but Archer Monroe was the goddamn devil. Truth is, Archer know that there are some fates that are much worse than death. He needed me to suffer, to rot, to waste away in the dark. He vented, and I listened. He beat me, and I took it. My agony was your daddy’s private joy. The thing is, about zookeepers, they always wind up talking to their animals. And over time, things kind of changed. See, I don’t think he ever expected me to get out. Whoa ! That was a close one. That was a real close one.

CATHERINE	I should’ve put a bullet in your head myself.

LAUREN	No ! Morgan !

MORGAN	Revenge ! You can’t put a price on it, Catherine.

LAUREN	Carson. What do you want ?

MORGAN	I want my pound of flesh.

LAUREN	Then let me help you. I’ll testify to the truth. I’ll expose all the secrets. Everything. Everything my family did. Just… Just let them live.

MORGAN	You’d do that for me ? Psyche ! I don’t need your help. I don’t cut deals.

LAUREN	Fine. Then fuck you ! I gave you excuses. But i swear you’re not walking out of that door alive.

MORGAN	I am really, really excited… to meet the rest of your family. Especially Claire.

LAUREN	I swear to God, if you touche her…

MORGAN	You’ll what ? You’ll beg for mercy ? You’ll smudge your makeup with tears ? Fuck you ! You remember that little speech you gave me with the evidence bag ? It was very cool. Gave me chills. Here’s my counter. I am gonna burn this family’s legacy to the ground with the secrets that I know. I am gonna slit your little brother’s throat, and I am gonna take a piss on Archer’s grave. And you will noot be there to experience your family’s shame because you and your fucking whore mother will be here, rotting away in the darkness. Now your body will consume itself. Your sanity will snap. And just befor you die your miserable death, you will know exactly what I survived. And your husband and your daughter will spend the rest of their lives wondering why Mommy abandoned them. And… I almost forgot the most important part. When I tell’em that I…

LAUREN	A pathetic lunatic ? Yeah no one’s ever gonna believe you. No one ever even looked for you because you don’t matter.

MORGAN	Shut up.

LAUREN	Not even to your own father.

MORGAN	Shut the hell up ! Ow ! Goddam nit ! You still don’t get it, do ya ? I’m your goddamn father !

CATHERINE	you’re a Monroe. You understand me ? We take care of our own. What’ll we do about him ?

LAUREN	He disappeared 30 years ago.
