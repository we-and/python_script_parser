BOBBY	(grunts) Wait.

ANNOUNCER	Previously on the Oval.

LILLY	What will they do with him?

DONALD	You don't wanna know.

VICTORIA	So who's this one?  Did she bind you?

HUNTER	Yeah.  Yeah, it was fun.

VICTORIA	The next time one of your goons tries to keep me out of the Oval, it'll be his last.  Tell me the truth.

SHARON	I'm tired of sitting around here, trying to be quiet, so that I don't upset him.

BARRY	I want my daughter back.

RICHARD	I'm gonna do it.  You know, just give me the gun.

BARRY	I'm gonna kill him.

RICHARD	Just give me the gun.

BARRY	Dad, I'm not giving the…

RICHARD	Just give it to me.

BARRY	I'm not giving it to you.  Dad.  Are you all right?

RICHARD	Are you--are you shot?

BARRY	No, I'm not shot.  Are you?

RICHARD	Are you sure?

BARRY	I'm positive.  Are you shot?

RICHARD	No.

BARRY	Are you sure?

RICHARD	No, I'm--I'm--I'm--I'm sure.  I'm not.

BARRY	Are you sure?

RICHARD	Yes, I'm fine.  This is why you're not supposed to have a gun.

BARRY	Dad, I'm sorry--I didn't know it was cocked.

RICHARD	Son--son, listen to me.  Listen to me.  Just--just go home.

BARRY	Dad, I'm sorry.

RICHARD	Just go.

BARRY	I'm sorry.

RICHARD	Okay.  Okay.  Look, I--I got to get to work in a couple of hours.  I got…

BARRY	No, Dad.  What about my daughter?

RICHARD	Okay.  Look, now just--just go get your mother and--and--and go to the police.  Man, you shot a damn hole in the door.  One of us could've been killed.

BARRY	I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

RICHARD	Barry, just go home.  Barry, just--just go.

DAPHANIE	Help.  Help him.  They shot him.  Somebody shot him.  Help.  Help.  Help.  Help.  Help.  Help.  They shot him.  Somebody shot him.  Help.  €Help.

MAN	Ladies and gentlemen.

SINGER	Feels like I'm running out of time.  You gotta get yours, I gotta get mine.  Not really sure where we're headed to.  I just hope that you'll make it when I do.

VICTORIA	Damn, I was so close.

HUNTER	(sighs) If I die you're nothing.

VICTORIA	Not true.  I'd play the sad dutiful widow.

HUNTER	Yeah, you always got an angle.

VICTORIA	Yes, I do.  And so do you, but yours is short.

HUNTER	It gets the job done.

VICTORIA	Don't be so sure.

HUNTER	Yeah, whatever.

VICTORIA	Get up.  You at least have to give the impression that you're excited about this job.

HUNTER	You wanna go to the Oval?  (snaps finger) Knock yourself out.

VICTORIA	I would, but I have plans.

HUNTER	What plans?

VICTORIA	Get up.

HUNTER	Ow.  God, you're wicked.  How's Gayle?

VICTORIA	What do you care?

HUNTER	What do you mean what do I care?  She's my daughter.

VICTORIA	So now you're the caring father?

HUNTER	She was assaulted.

VICTORIA	Oh, really?

HUNTER	(scoffs) I'm gonna have that boy's ass.

VICTORIA	(chuckles) So now the father is concern about his 16-year-old daughter when apparently he assaults other 16-year-old girls.

HUNTER	I've never assaulted a woman, without them asking for it first, nicely.

VICTORIA	Karma is a bitch, darling.

HUNTER	Yes, I married it.  You really aren't concerned about Gayle?

VICTORIA	No.

HUNTER	You are the coldest reptile I've ever seen.

VICTORIA	Don't forget, the smartest one who put you here.

HUNTER	(scoffs) You know how to turn it on, don't you?

VICTORIA	Yes, I do.

HUNTER	Everything but me.

VICTORIA	I wouldn't […] you to save your children.

HUNTER	Good, because rather I'd die first.

VICTORIA	Keep talking and you just might get your wish.

HUNTER	It'd be a blessing.

VICTORIA	(laughs)

HUNTER	Yeah, laugh it up.

VICTORIA	Dumb bitch.  Keep posting everything.

YUMA	(on phone) Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	I'm gonna go shopping this afternoon.

YUMA	(on phone) Ma'am?

VICTORIA	You heard me.

YUMA	(on phone) We can get you what you need.

VICTORIA	I want to go.

YUMA	(on phone) Okay.  I'll arrange it.  Make it small?

VICTORIA	No, no, no.  I want the full treatment.

YUMA	(on phone) Yes, ma'am.  Do you know where you'd like to go?

VICTORIA	I'll send you the address in a minute.

YUMA	(on phone) Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	(scoffs)

NANCY	Hey.

SHARON	Hey.

BARRY	What's up?

NANCY	Did you find her?

BARRY	No.

NANCY	Barry, I'm so sorry.

BARRY	Okay.  We got to go to the police station.

NANCY	Yeah, I'm already dressed.

SHARON	You go ahead.

BARRY	You gonna work?

SHARON	Yes.

BARRY	My daughter is missing, and you are going to work?

SHARON	What can I do?

BARRY	You should be here for me.

SHARON	Barry.

BARRY	No, it's cool.  It's cool.  Go to work.

SHARON	We have bills, and I can't take this time off.

BARRY	Uh-hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  Do what you got to do.

SHARON	Don't talk to me like that.

BARRY	My daughter is missing.

SHARON	I understand that.

BARRY	You're heading to work by now.

SHARON	Are you serious right now?

BARRY	Of all times in the world.

NANCY	Stop it.  This is my fault.  I don't need you all falling out with each other over something that I did.

SHARON	Ms. Nancy, this has nothing to do with you.


BARRY	Don't talk to my mother like that.

SHARON	Give me the keys.

BARRY	I need my car.

SHARON	I have to go to work.  Give me the damn keys.

BARRY	No.

SHARON	What is your problem?

BARRY	What is your problem?

NANCY	Hey.

BARRY	I need my car.

NANCY	Take mine.  Come on.

BARRY	Yeah, because I need my car.

NANCY	Barry.

BARRY	I don't wanna hear it.  We got to go.

NANCY	(scoffs) The court's don't even open until 9:00.  Where is your father?  Hey.

RICHARD	All right.

NANCY	Are you all right?


RICHARD	Yeah, I'm fine.  Yeah.  I, um, uh, I just got to get ready for work.

NANCY	Okay.  I ironed your uniform.

RICHARD	Thank you.

NANCY	What's wrong?

RICHARD	Nothing.

NANCY	I know you.

RICHARD	Oh, I'm--I'm just worried about that baby.

NANCY	Oh, I know it.  I'm so sorry.

RICHARD	Don't fall apart.  Okay, just--let's go down to that court with Barry and, you know, so he keeps his cool.  Okay?

NANCY	Okay.

RICHARD	I'll see you when I get home.

NANCY	Okay.  Barry, I'll be waiting in the car.

DONALD	Hi.

LILLY	Hi.

DONALD	Did you finally get some sleep?

LILLY	Yes.  (sighs)

DONALD	Are you okay?

LILLY	I will be.

DONALD	So, what are you doing today?

LILLY	I have a few meetings.

DONALD	Okay.

LILLY	And you?

DONALD	First day as chief of staff.  (chuckles)

LILLY	Yeah.  (chuckles)

DONALD	Yeah.  I'm glad you were awake before I left.

LILLY	Yeah.

DONALD	Are you sure you're okay?

LILLY	Uh, you know, you should, uh, get started with your day.

DONALD	You know, it would be really bad for me to not going to work on my first day.

LILLY	Oh, no, no.  I--I--I wouldn't think of it.  You have to go.

DONALD	Okay.

LILLY	Okay.

VELMA	Mrs. Winthrop, there is a phone call from the First Lady, ma'am.

DONALD	Wow.  She must have been really impressed.

LILLY	Thank you.  Hello?

VICTORIA	(on phone) Lilly.

LILLY	Hi.  (chuckles)

VICTORIA	(on phone) Your dress was a hit.

LILLY	Oh, well, thank you.

VICTORIA	(on phone) Where were you?

LILLY	I was delayed.

VICTORIA	(on phone) Well, I wanna go shopping today, and I want you to come along.

LILLY	Shopping?

VICTORIA	(on phone) Yes.

LILLY	Well, can you do that?

VICTORIA	(on phone) (chuckles) Of course, I can.

LILLY	Okay.

VICTORIA	(on phone) I've been told that I need to tone it down in this job.  So, I want to go to a particular store that I know.

LILLY	Okay.  Uh, I'll be right over.

VICTORIA	(on phone) Noon.

LILLY	Yes, I--I'll--I'll see you then.  Bye.

DONALD	What was that about?

LILLY	She wants me to go shopping with her.

DONALD	(chuckles) Are you two best friends now?

LILLY	I guess.  She barely spoke two words to me during the fitting, and now she wants to go shopping.

DONALD	Well, do not look a gift horse in the mouth.  Now, go with it.

LILLY	I don't know if I'm up for it.

DONALD	Why not?

LILLY	Donald, I shot a man.

DONALD	No, you shot a lowlife.  Okay, you need to get that out of your head.

LILLY	Will you find out about him?

DONALD	You should really let this go.

LILLY	I just…

DONALD	I just need you to let this go.

LILLY	Okay.  Okay.

DONALD	I see you when I get home.

LILLY	Okay.

DONALD	Or, hey, I'll see you there.

LILLY	Yes.

JEAN	(sighs)

PRISCILLA	Let me guess, she didn't eat it.

JEAN	Nope.

PRISCILLA	That little girl.

JEAN	You know they say, rats can smell poison in food.

PRISCILLA	I was joking.

JEAN	I know.  (chuckles) It was outside of her door.

PRISCILLA	Okay.  Well, let's get the table set for breakfast.

JEAN	Okay.

PRISCILLA	Are you okay?

JEAN	Yes.

PRISCILLA	Are you sure?

JEAN	Yes.

PRISCILLA	What's wrong, Jean?

JEAN	Nothing.

PRISCILLA	Okay.  Have you seen the son?

JEAN	Yes.

PRISCILLA	He's a bit of a mystery, that one.

JEAN	I think he's kind of creepy.

PRISCILLA	Why do you say that?

JEAN	(sighs) I'm not sure.  I was down the hall picking up the tray, and I just felt somebody staring at me.

PRISCILLA	Was it him?

JEAN	I'm not sure.  I just saw a naked shadow in the bedroom, and then the door closed.

PRISCILLA	What?

JEAN	Yeah.

PRISCILLA	And you think it was him?

JEAN	I mean, I think so, or a ghost.

PRISCILLA	That's not funny.

JEAN	Trying to laugh about it.

PRISCILLA	Watch yourself.

JEAN	I will.

PRISCILLA	And when Richard gets here, I'm going to talk to him about putting a man in his cleaning duties.

JEAN	Okay.

PRISCILLA	All right?

JEAN	I think that's a good idea.

PRISCILLA	Okay.  Listen, because this family is unlike anything we've ever seen.

JEAN	Yeah, well, the last family…

PRISCILLA	Was bad, but not this bad.

JEAN	Yeah.  But those late-night fast food runs.

PRISCILLA	Oh.  See, I didn't mind that.  I got to rest.

JEAN	(chuckles)

PRISCILLA	It's his room.

JEAN	Yeah.

PRISCILLA	Go on and I'll have Sam stand outside.

JEAN	Thank you.

PRISCILLA	You're welcome.  Sam.

JASON	Come in.

JEAN	Good morning, sir.

JASON	Oh.  Please don't call me sir.

JEAN	It's the job.

JASON	I see.

JEAN	You rang?

JASON	Uh, yeah.  Um, I need mouthwash.

JEAN	I'll just go get some.

JASON	Uh, I'm sure you put it in the bathroom.  Would you like to check?

JEAN	Nope.  It's fine.  I can grab some more.

JASON	No, no, no, no.  No, go check.  Please.

JEAN	Uh…

JASON	I insist.

JEAN	Yes, sir.  Here it is.

JASON	Oh, got it.  I didn't see it.

JEAN	No problem.  Shall I move it somewhere else for you?

JASON	How old are you?

JEAN	I'm 28, sir.

JASON	Really?  You, you look so much younger.

JEAN	So did you want me to put it back where it was?

JASON	Uh, yeah.  Thank you.

JEAN	(indistinct)

JEAN	Can I get you anything else, sir?

JASON	That's a loaded question.

JEAN	Okay.  In that case, just give me a call if there is anything that you need.  Excuse me.  Sir.  Thanks.

JASON	Okay.  Thank you.

JEAN	You're welcome.

SAM	Everything all right?

JEAN	Yeah.

SAM	Okay.

JEAN	Yeah.

KYLE	(exhales) Good morning, sir.

DONALD	What are you still doing here?

KYLE	I came to drive you to work, sir.

DONALD	You are not driving me to work.

KYLE	I'd like to, sir.

DONALD	What is wrong with you?

KYLE	I'm just doing my job.

DONALD	No.  What you're doing is stalking.

KYLE	No, sir.  I'm not stalking you.  I'm not doing that in the least.

DONALD	Will you get lost?

KYLE	Sir.

DONALD	Look, stop it Kyle!  Stop it!

KYLE	Well, sir, if you want, you can have me moved to another team.

DONALD	I know exactly what I can do.  I'll have you reassigned when I get to work.

KYLE	(sighs) Are you sure about that, sir?

DONALD	Yes, yes.  You'd be better working for the new AG.  Hmm.

KYLE	If you wish, sir.

DONALD	I'll be driving myself.  You can leave.

KYLE	(chuckles) Yes, sir.

DONALD	And do not follow me.

KYLE	No, sir.

HUNTER	So how was your first night like here?

JASON	Creepy.

HUNTER	Hmm.

VICTORIA	Stop it.  We couldn't be more fortunate.

JASON	Yeah, if you say so.

VICTORIA	I do.

JASON	How was your night?

HUNTER	It was good.

JASON	I bet.

VICTORIA	What's that supposed to mean?

JASON	I just know he had a good night.

VICTORIA	Jason.

JASON	Mother.

VICTORIA	Are you exploring again?

JASON	Whatever do you mean?

HUNTER	You know exactly what she means.

JASON	No.

HUNTER	Jason, you're not to be wandering around this place.

JASON	But, Dad, come on, how could I do that?  The Secret Service are so amazing.

HUNTER	We're not in the Governor's mansion anymore.  I'll show you just how amazing they are.

JASON	Yes, sir.

VICTORIA	Where's your sister?

JASON	I don't know.

VICTORIA	Excuse me.  Will you check on my daughter?

PRISCILLA	Yes, ma'am.

VICTORIA	If she doesn't answer, go into her room.

PRISCILLA	Yes, ma'am.  (sighs)

JEAN	I see that look.  Deep breath, Priscilla.

PRISCILLA	(exhales) Okay.

PRISCILLA	Ms. Franklin.  (gasps)

GAYLE	Who the hell told you to come in here?

PRISCILLA	Your mother, ma'am.

GAYLE	Get the hell out.

PRISCILLA	Yes, ma'am.

GAYLE	Wait.  What did you see?

PRISCILLA	I saw nothing, ma'am.

GAYLE	(scoffs) You're lying.  Look at me.  Look at me!  You just came in here to embarrass me, didn't you?

PRISCILLA	No, ma'am.

GAYLE	Then why the hell are you in here?

PRISCILLA	Your mother would like you in the dining room for breakfast.

GAYLE	Breakfast has a T, bitch.  It's breakfast.  I said get out.  What?  You tell someone what you saw and I will have you fired.

PRISCILLA	Yes, ma'am.

GAYLE	Oh, you don't think that I can?

PRISCILLA	Yes, you can.  Uh-hmm.

GAYLE	Where is that butler's son at?

PRISCILLA	Ma'am?

GAYLE	That butler, his son, where is he?

PRISCILLA	I'm not sure, ma'am.

GAYLE	You know he tried to rape me?

PRISCILLA	Is that so?

GAYLE	You don't believe me?

PRISCILLA	Well, yesterday you said he raped you.  So did he or did he try?

GAYLE	There's a P-E-D in raped.  And who are you to question me?

PRISCILLA	Oh, I'm not questioning you, ma'am.  I'm just asking.

GAYLE	Well, he tried and I fought him off.  Did they take him to jail?

PRISCILLA	I'm not sure, ma'am.

GAYLE	Hmm.  Well, he should be in jail.  He's a terrible person.

PRISCILLA	Again, your family would like you in the dining room for breakfast.

GAYLE	You don't agree?

PRISCILLA	I've known him all his life.  He is a great kid.  I've never known him to do anything remotely close to harming someone.

GAYLE	Yeah, well, you don't know him.

PRISCILLA	No, I do.  But you know who I didn't know was Emmett Till.

GAYLE	Who the hell is Emmett Till?

PRISCILLA	He's a boy who was 13 years old who he was killed by some very angry people because someone accused him of something he did not do.

GAYLE	Yeah, I know who he is.  Get out.

PRISCILLA	Certainly, ma'am.

GAYLE	Emmett.

SHARON	Uh, see, ma'am.  It says twice a day.  See here?

MS. JACKSON	But I can't read that.  It's so small.

SHARON	Ma'am, that's what it says.

MS. JACKSON	Are you sure?

SHARON	I'm looking at it.

MS. JACKSON	No, it don't say that.

SHARON	What does it say?

MS. JACKSON	You getting huffy with me.

SHARON	No, ma'am.  I'm sorry.

KAREEM	All right.  Hey, Sharon.  I got it.  Hey, Ms. Jackson.  It's good to see you.  Uh, this is a magnifying glass.  Okay?  You see--you see what it says right there?

MS. JACKSON	Oh, yes.  Yes, I see it.  Yeah, oh, yes, yes, yes.

KAREEM	Okay.  How would you like to have that?  On the house.

MS. JACKSON	You trying to upset me?

KAREEM	No.  No, ma'am.  No.  It's the thank you for being such a valued customer here at Richardson Pharmacy.

MS. JACKSON	Well, thank you.

KAREEM	Uh-hmm.

MS. JACKSON	But you better do something about that girl.

KAREEM	I will.  I really will.

MS. JACKSON	Because see, I have supported you and your daddy for many years now.

KAREEM	Yes, ma'am.

MS. JACKSON	'Cause you're black owned.  But I will take no sass.

KAREEM	Yes, ma'am.

MS. JACKSON	Ain't gonna do that.  That thing, won't do that.

KAREEM	Absolutely.

MS. JACKSON	It ain't--it ain't my nature.

KAREEM	All right.  I completely agree.  I completely agree.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ms. Jackson.  Appreciate you.

MS. JACKSON	Better get you all shit together.  I don't take no sass.

KAREEM	Ms. Jackson, I need that magnifying glass back.  It's, uh, it's okay.

MS. JACKSON	You told me it was mine and I can have it for free.

KAREEM	Yeah.  Yes, ma'am.

MS. JACKSON	Now, you're gonna take that back, too?

KAREEM	No, no.  No.  All yours.

MS. JACKSON	Get your shit together, boy.  Get your shit together.


KAREEM	Yes, ma'am.

MS. JACKSON	Talking about money back.

KAREEM	I--I understand.

MS. JACKSON	And I will spend my money.

KAREEM	Right.

MS. JACKSON	I take no sass.

KAREEM	Yes, ma'am.

MS. JACKSON	I'll tell you what?

KAREEM	Yes, ma'am.

MS. JACKSON	That girl, looking like that, you better look at me.  Honey, boy, I used to really be sexy.

KAREEM	(chuckles) Okay.  Okay.

MS. JACKSON	When I was her age.

KAREEM	Uh-huh.

MS. JACKSON	And I was sassy, too.  I'm 93 now, I know what to do.

KAREEM	You don't look a damn over 50, Ms. Jackson.

MS. JACKSON	I believe it.  But you all better get you all shit together.

KAREEM	Yes, Ms. Jackson.  All right.  I'll see you Sunday.

MS. JACKSON	I don't take no sass.

KAREEM	You're being real short today, Sharon.

SHARON	I'm sorry.

KAREEM	It must be that trap star boyfriend of yours.

SHARON	Don't.  (sighs) Can we just get back to work?

KAREEM	Work.  Yeah.  Work, work.

SHARON	Uh-hmm.

KAREEM	Work, work, work.

SHARON	Yeah.

KAREEM	Work, work.  When did I become the enemy?

SHARON	When you keep talking about him.  I told you I don't like you bringing him up, okay?

KAREEM	Is it because of how I feel about you or, or is it because of how you feel about me?

SHARON	I don't feel anyway about you.

KAREEM	Okay.  All right.  I just--I'm sorry.  I thought, you know--I could tell you're going through something, I wanna make sure you're okay.  I mean, Sharon, I care about you and I don't want you to be…

SHARON	You have a customer.

KAREEM	Hi, sir.  How are you doing?

RICHARD	(sighs)

PRISCILLA	Oh, good morning.


RICHARD	Good morning.

PRISCILLA	It's not like you to be late.

RICHARD	Three minutes.

PRISCILLA	That's a lifetime for you.

RICHARD	Lay off.

PRISCILLA	I'm sorry.

RICHARD	(sighs) Are they up?

PRISCILLA	Yes.  They've started breakfast.

RICHARD	Have they said anything?

PRISCILLA	It's like nothing ever happened.

RICHARD	(sighs) Oh, the girl can accuse my son of rape and nothing?

PRISCILLA	And she's still saying it.

RICHARD	Is she?

PRISCILLA	Except she said that he tried to.

RICHARD	Can't get her damn story straight.

PRISCILLA	This first daughter is a mess.

RICHARD	Yeah.  I gathered.

PRISCILLA	Oh, you have no idea.

RICHARD	What happened?

PRISCILLA	I told her about Emmett Till.

RICHARD	A lot of help that's gonna do.

PRISCILLA	Well, it's worth a try.

RICHARD	But if she tells her parents?

PRISCILLA	They don't believe her.

RICHARD	How do you know?

PRISCILLA	Not one mention of it.  But they want coffee.

RICHARD	I'll go.

PRISCILLA	Are you sure?

RICHARD	Yeah, if they're gonna say something, now would be the time.

PRISCILLA	Okay.

VICTORIA	Well, how nice of you to join us.

HUNTER	Hey, honey.  How are you?

GAYLE	What kind of question is that?

HUNTER	Well, one that is appropriate.

GAYLE	Well, I'm fine.

HUNTER	Hey, we're gonna take care of him.

GAYLE	Of who?

HUNTER	That boy that hurt you.

JASON	What boy?

GAYLE	Shut up.

JASON	Uh, what boy?

HUNTER	When Donald comes in, I wanna talk to him.  That boy is gonna get what's coming to him.  You hold your head up.

VICTORIA	(chuckling)

HUNTER	Is something funny, dear?

VICTORIA	Hold your head up.  What are you trying to do, motivate her?  You do know what she's claiming, don't you?

HUNTER	Can't you ever shut up?

VICTORIA	Uh-hmm.  Narcissists don't know empathy.  Classic.

JASON	We're a family full of them, aren't we?

RICHARD	Good morning.

HUNTER	Good morning.

VICTORIA	Good morning.

RICHARD	Coffee?

HUNTER	Yes, please.

JASON	So, who are you?

RICHARD	I am the head butler.  We met yesterday.

HUNTER	The head butler?

RICHARD	Uh, yes, sir.  Can I get you anything?

HUNTER	Was your son here yesterday?

RICHARD	Yes, sir, he was.

HUNTER	Jason, leave the room, please.

JASON	Why?

HUNTER	Because I said so.  Do you know how much trouble your son is in?

RICHARD	Sir, with all due respect…

HUNTER	Why would you bring him here?

RICHARD	Sir, my son is incapable of doing anything like that.

HUNTER	So you're calling my daughter a liar?

RICHARD	I am saying that my son has been coming here since he was a child.  He has played with the children of the last two presidents.  Sir, he's a good boy.

HUNTER	Who raped my daughter.  You are fired.  Get out of my sight.  And get out of this house, now.

RICHARD	(clears throat)0

PRISCILLA	How did it go?

RICHARD	He fired me.

PRISCILLA	What?  Richard.  What?

VICTORIA	Nice passion.  Overplayed but nice.

HUNTER	Will you shut up?  Honey, I will take care of the boy.

VICTORIA	Are you gonna tell him the truth?  So you will take that lie to your grave, won't you?  Hmm, you are a wicked little troll.

HUNTER	What are you talking about?

VICTORIA	She lied.

HUNTER	What?

VICTORIA	That boy didn't touch her.

HUNTER	You never believe her.

VICTORIA	Hunter, don't be so stupid.  This is the White House.  There's surveillance everywhere.  Have them play it back for you.

GAYLE	What, even in my room?

VICTORIA	Everywhere.  Tell him the truth.

GAYLE	He didn't do anything.  I was drunk.

HUNTER	Why would you lie to us something like that?

VICTORIA	Well, she's your daughter, so…

HUNTER	Go to your room.  Now.  (sighs)

VICTORIA	Hunter, that man has been working here for years.  You get him back here and apologize.

HUNTER	Yeah, I will.  I will.  Wait.  There's cameras everywhere?

VICTORIA	Wouldn't you like to know.  (chuckles)

KYLE	How is he?

AGENT JERRY	Passed out from the pen.

KYLE	Did he ever say anything?

AGENT JERRY	Nope.  Nothing.

KYLE	Hey, Jerry, are there anybody else here?

AGENT JERRY	No, sir.  It'll just be you.

KYLE	And you really couldn't get him to talk?

AGENT JERRY	No.

KYLE	Well, I bet I can.

AGENT JERRY	You always do.

KYLE	Get the hell out of here.

AGENT JERRY	Yes, sir.

KYLE	I got it, guys.

SURGEON	All right.

KYLE	(sniffs) Mwah.  Rise and shine.  Good morning.

BOBBY	I'm gonna kill you.

KYLE	Uh-hmm.  How are you, too?

BOBBY	Don't you ever put your lips on me again.

KYLE	Come on.  But they're so full and beautiful.

BOBBY	Get me out of here, Kyle.

KYLE	Did you talk to them?

BOBBY	You know damn well I didn't.

KYLE	So what happened?

BOBBY	Nothing.  Now get me some pain meds.

KYLE	Why did she shoot you?  Bobby?

BOBBY	I don't know.  She got spooked.

KYLE	By?

BOBBY	Your guy.  Now get me some pain meds.

KYLE	Now come on.

BOBBY	(groans)

KYLE	I thought you liked the pain.

BOBBY	You asshole.  Is it a clean shot?

KYLE	Yes, stranger, through and through.

BOBBY	Oh, goddammit.  I didn't think she would do it.  (groans) (breathing heavily)

KYLE	Ready?  Stay in there.  You're gonna be fine.

BOBBY	Get me out of here, Kyle.

KYLE	Are you sure you didn't talk to them?

BOBBY	What the hell I look like to you?  You see what they did to me?

KYLE	Then what happened?

BOBBY	Nothing happened.

KYLE	You're telling me that you weren't there to have sex with her?

BOBBY	No.  She barely talked to me the whole flight.  I beat her home to do a little recon.  Somehow she came ome sooner than I thought.

KYLE	You're lying.

BOBBY	Why would I lie to you?

KYLE	I had a man there watching you.

BOBBY	Good.  Then he'll tell you the same thing I just did.  Now get me out of here before these assholes come back.  I don't know how much more of this I can take.  (groans)

KYLE	You're so sexy, laying here all vulnerable.

BOBBY	Kyle.

KYLE	Nice.

BOBBY	You really gonna do this right now?  (groans)

KYLE	No, I'm not.  I like to be dominated, not the other way around.

BOBBY	Good.  Get these cuffs on me.

KYLE	All right.  Come on.

BOBBY	Wait.  You go to help me.

KYLE	No.  Come on.  Let's go.

BOBBY	Asshole.  (groaning)

KYLE	Nice ass.

BOBBY	Thank you.

KYLE	Whoop.  Poop.

BARRY	These are the custody papers, signed by a judge.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.

BARRY	Okay.  So are you gonna go pick her up?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Um, do you know her whereabouts?

BARRY	No.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  Do you have a picture?

NANCY	Yes.  Oh, it's here.  Here.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  And where was she last seen?

BARRY	I have told you this already.  She came into the house and took her.

NANCY	Barry.

BARRY	She…

NANCY	Calm down.  She's with the Rakudushis.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  Sit tight.  I'll be right back.

BARRY	Shit.  They're not gonna do nothing.

NANCY	Yes, they will.  Barry, I know you're mad at me.

BARRY	I'm not mad at you.

NANCY	I think you are.

BARRY	I'm mad at her.

NANCY	And me.

BARRY	Ma, this is…

NANCY	Go on, tell me.

BARRY	Tell you what?

NANCY	Son, tell me how you feel.

BARRY	Look, Ma, this is not the time or the place to be doing this.

NANCY	Get it off you, okay?  Tell me.  So you can stop taking it out on Sharon.

BARRY	This has nothing to do with Sharon.

NANCY	I think it does.

BARRY	Ma, you--you don't know.

NANCY	Y'all been having problems?

BARRY	I just…

NANCY	Just what?  Tell me.

BARRY	Yeah.  Ma, how could you do that after I told you not to?  You--you say I'm a kid, I swear, you are a child sometimes.  I knew she would.  I knew she would do that.  And it was damn stupid for you to let her in our house.

NANCY	I'm sorry.

BARRY	Well, you asked.

NANCY	You're right.

BARRY	Ma, I love you, okay?  I still love you, okay?

NANCY	I love you too, son.  I was just--I was just trying to do the right thing.

BARRY	Sure, you were, mom.

NANCY	Just trying to make peace.

BARRY	Ma, when have you ever known the devil to want peace?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Okay.  So you said the woman was with the Rakudushis cult?

BARRY	Yes.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	And what's her name?

BARRY	Ruth Hartman.  I told you that.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Does she have any scars or tattoos?

NANCY	Yes.  She--she has a tattoo.

BARRY	Yes.  It says Barry on her shoulder.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Is that the tattoo?

BARRY	Yes.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	And is this her?

NANCY	What happened to her?

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	That's what we're trying to find out.

BARRY	Well, where's my daughter?  Where is my daughter?

HUNTER	Next on The Oval.

DETECTIVE JEFFERSON	Is that her?


GAYLE	Go to hell.

VICTORIA	I've been in the hell since the day you were born.

GAYLE	Okay.  Then, leave me alone.

RICHARD	I got fired.

SAM	What?

RICHARD	The president fired me.

HUNTER	I'm surprised you're even here with that hot piece you call white right in your home.

DONALD	Actually, she's with your wife.

HUNTER	Why?

PRISCILLA	I saw the first daughter taking selfies naked once.

VICTORIA	Do you know why I brought you here?

LILLY	To go shopping with you.

VICTORIA	Oh, dear, I brought you here so that you would understand who I am.
