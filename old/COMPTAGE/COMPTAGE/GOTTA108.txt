JAMIE	I Love you. You Love Me. We Love each other. I Love how We make Love. I Love what you do to Me. I Love your Pancakes. I Love your Lil’ Black Dress. How it likes to be worn by Your Hips, the way Perfume Loves to Smell you, how Lipstick  loves to kiss-your-lips. I Love This Feeling you give Me ...The Feeling of Home Located In The State of Grace. But Would You Love Me if I wasn’t sitting on some M’s in My Bank Account? Would you Love me if I was Blind, Crippled or Crazy? What is Love? Love makes Me Strong ... it makes me Weak. I Love My Moms. I Love My Sun, Virgil. I Love his Mother, Cheryl. I mean, We are still married, I Love my estranged Wife in my sometimes Strange Life. And I really Love Nola...

  
NOLA	Did I say you could sit down?

JAMIE	Do I need permission?

NOLA	Of course.

JAMIE	Excuse me Miss? May I sit next to you?

NOLA	Loved that song with Jay-Z and Pharrell.

JAMIE	So what you know ‘bout Hov?

NOLA	He’s that Dude. You know Jay mentions Rilke on that Joint What They Gonna Do, from The Blueprint 2, right?

JAMIE	I have a Friend of a Friend who knows Jay, and told me that one of his Dopest Tracks, ÒThere’s Been a Murder,Ó was influenced by Rilke’s ÒDeath Experience.Ó You know that one?

NOLA	Nah. Can you spit a Few Bars?

JAMIE	We Continue Our Play/Picking up Gestures Now and Then/And Anxiously Reciting that Which Was Difficult to Learn/But You’re Far Away/So That For a While We Play Life Rapturously/Not Thinking of Any Applause. Rapturously. Rilke was the Jay-Z of his Time.

NOLA	So I guess you like Poetry, or Whatever?

JAMIE	Love Poetry. My name is Jamie.

NOLA	Nola.

JAMIE	Pleased to meet you Nola.

NOLA	Likewise, Mr. Jamie.

JAMIE	Dayum. Mister Jamie? It’s like Dat?

NOLA	You’re Grown-Ass As Fuck.

JAMIE	I Love your Candor.

NOLA	I Love the fact that you used the word Candor.

JAMIE	As opposed to keepin’ it One-Hunnit?

NOLA	Yeah. ‘Cuz that would be too predictable. Everybody is sayin’ Keep It One-Hunnit. I mean everybody.

JAMIE	Especially the White Hipsters tryin’ to Lean and Dab around the pool at the Weekend Rooftop Parties at the Ganesvoort Park Avenue. That’s their Cultural Black Card. Plus, they know all the words to Back To Back.

NOLA	Of Course. Drake is a Cult.

JAMIE	No doubt Nola. But here’s the burning question.

NOLA	Which is?

JAMIE	Do you believe in Love at First Sight?

NOLA	In Love Jones, yes. But not so much in Real Life.

JAMIE	Yes, I really Love Nola. Full of Life, Passion, Impulsiveness. My Life is Order, Compartmentalization and Situational Ethics. Nola represents none of those things. And that’s why I Love her ... I Think.

NOLA	Bonjour.

GREER	Bonjour, Mademoiselle Nola.

NOLA	Come on Talley-Ho’.

GREER	What? What does that mean?

NOLA	It’s just my bad French.

GREER	Why’d you leave the other night?

NOLA	You had all your Beckys with the Good Hair with you, so I decided to take off.

GREER	You’re right. I’m sorry. I don’t want you to be Mad at me.

NOLA	Greer, I’m not Mad.

GREER	Prove it. Let me come over?

NOLA	Yo, Greer...you look like Boo Boo Da Fool right now. What ... What do you have on?

GREER	Boo Boo Da Fool will be a Fool For You All Day Everyday, just to see you smile.

NOLA	Nola Darling is Smiling.

GREER	You speakin’ in Third Person now?

NOLA	Yeah. It’s called The Racqueletta Effect.

GREER	The Racka-What? As my Grandma Damita Jo used to say, You sound like you on that Stuff!

NOLA	I’m High but it’s not Kush related. I’m High from the fact that I Sold a Painting. For a nice Piece of Change.

GREER	Sweet! So let’s have Lunch today.

NOLA	Nah, I appreciate the invite Greer, but I’m busy. So back to your gear...what up wit’ ÔDose Jimmy Huggers?

GREER	Yo! I kinda like that. Um ...message to me... put Jimmy Huggers on the list. Copy That. Wait, when we were at dinner, didn’t you tell me to take a risk? This is what risk looks like. They were all the rage in Europe in the 70s. My Dad Designed them when he was an Expat in Paris. They are a Political Statement declaring that Black Men could not be restricted in any Way, Shape, or Form. Laugh now, but when these Free Johnsons hit the runway next Fashion Week, I’m gonna be laughing all the way to The Bank.

NOLA	Free Johnson Slacks?! That is catchy. I’m not Mad at that...

GREER	So for real, why did you leave last week?

NOLA	Seriously, I had to go to the hospital to see a sick friend.

GREER	Wow. Is he ok?

NOLA	She ... is. She’s getting better every day.

GREER	See that’s what I love about you. How you care about people. What’s up with lunch?

NOLA	I told you, I’m busy and I’m not going anywhere with you dressed like that.

GREER	Who says we have to eat out? Who says we have to be dressed? Yes...Nola!

NOLA	Overstreet!

GREER	Overstreet? What is that?

NOLA	What?

GREER	You said ÒOverstreet. Ó What does that mean?

NOLA	It means you are going 120 in a 55 Mile Per Hour Zone. Yeah ... Greer is speeding ... It’s Overstreet... Slow Down.

GREER	I’m just so glad you’re in such a good mood. If selling a painting makes you like this, I hope you sell all of them.

NOLA	Thank you Greer. I mean ... it just feels so good to have some Paper. I can pay some Bills, buy some new Canvases, Paint, other Art, Brushes, Supplies. Maybe a Sexy Dress.

GREER	Yes to The Dress!

NOLA	Hey Greer ...this was great but I really do need to bounce.

GREER	Do you have plans with one of the other motherfuckas?

NOLA	Okay, so you want me to be Mad at you?

GREER	Check you later.

NOLA	Ok.

JAMIE	Hey, any messages? What’s up? To what do I owe this visit?

CHERYL	Another Shower for Two?

JAMIE	Yeah Baby. We had a lot of Fun.

CHERYL	Really? A lot of Fun?

JAMIE	No, I mean, yeah, we had Fun. I Love it when you are spontaneous.

CHERYL	There he is. Mr. Escape Artist. Always looking for the Trap-Door when the Stage is on Fire.

JAMIE	What the Hell does that mean? What the Hell were you doing in my Room?

CHERYL	Who is this Woman in the Portrait, Jamie?

JAMIE	Cheryl ... seriously ... that’s my Room.

CHERYL	And that’s our House. With our Money. And some of it, my Parent’s Money.

JAMIE	I have paid your Dad back for that Loan. With Interest. Now ... what were you doing in My Room?

CHERYL	So Virgil goes in your Room, looking for a Tie.

JAMIE	A Tie for what?

CHERYL	A Tie for a Special Assembly. He picked one your Blue Louis Vuitton’s and then he tells me to come upstairs. Shows me the Painting. ÒMa! She’s Gorgeous. Who is she?Ó That’s what I want to know, too, Jamie. Who is she?

JAMIE	It’s just a Woman in a Painting.

CHERYL	A Five-Thousand Dollar Check made out to Nola Darling for one her Paintings? Who is she, Jamie?

JAMIE	Cheryl, why are you getting so worked up?

CHERYL	Are you Fucking this Woman? This Nola? I’m assuming that’s her name. She looks kinda young.

JAMIE	She’s 27.

CHERYL	Are you Fucking 27 year-old Miss Nola Darling?

JAMIE	You never asked that before.

CHERYL	I’m assuming that’s a Yes.

JAMIE	It’s not good to assume and I don’t like Trick questions.

CHERYL	Are you Fucking This Young Bum Bitch?! What’s so Fucking Funny?

JAMIE	Because you’re so Bougie, you even speak proper when you curse. And did you call just call Nola a Bum Bitch? Wow! So that’s how A.K.A’s Talk now?

CHERYL	Call it my Hoody-Hood Lingua Franca. A language you understand.

JAMIE	Ok Cheryl. Do You.

CHERYL	What is she doing with a 40 year- old man? I hope you know you’re not the only one Fucking this Child. I know a Man is going to be a Man. Especially a Man who grew up in Brownsville.

JAMIE	What the Fuck does that mean?

CHERYL	It means I fell for a Climber.

JAMIE	But you put the Ladder out there.

CHERYL	You’re right. I did. You climbed up my Back to get to the Penthouse. I made you who you are. I gave you Cache. And I gave you a Son.

JAMIE	No, I gave you a Sun. And I gave you excitement. This New Jack from Brownsville Gave Upscale Jill a Brand New Thrill.

CHERYL	Why are we even still married?

JAMIE	Is this another Trick Question?

CHERYL	Did you tell Nola she’s your... Soul Mate? Like your other Soul Mate from Two Years ago? Or the one before that? How many Soul Mates do we get to have in this Life Jamie? And why can’t I have one?

JAMIE	Spontaneity is everything.

CHERYL	What did you say?!

JAMIE	I’m sorry.

CHERYL	I have Meetings tonight, so I’ll be Home late.

JAMIE	Fine.

ARLENE	Cash or charge?

NOLA	Charge, please.

ARLENE	This card is not going through.

NOLA	Really? Can you try again?

ARLENE	Sure. It’s declined.

NOLA	It doesn’t make any sense. I just made a large deposit on my debit account yesterday.

ARLENE	Do you have another card?

NOLA	Not one with any mone on it.

ARLENE	Do you want to try the ATM?

NOLA	No, the ATM isn’t going to help me.

ARLENE	Nola, you should call your bank.

NOLA	Word.

ARLENE	I’ll hold these for you.

 

 
NOLA	Hey Miss Ella

MISS ELLA	ÒHey Miss EllaÓ nothing. Come sit on my stoop.

NOLA	I know. The Check I can explain this time ...

MISS ELLA	... Nola I Love ÔDa Knicks and I use to Love me some Earl The Pearl Monroe, a.k.a, Black Jesus ... his name from the Baker League in Philly. But I don’t play Basketball and I don’t like Checks that Bounce. Being a landlord is Business and you’re Messin’ with my Business. Please understand that the minute you leave here ...I can get four times as much rent from White Folks as you are paying me now. Excuse my language, but Nola, you’re a grown ass woman you have to get your shit together! You have two more days. Or all of your shit will be out here on this sidewalk! Come inside, let me give you some vaseline for them ashy knees.

NOLA	Yo, what kinda Fuckin’ Game is this, Jamie?! Why did you put a Stop on That Check?!

JAMIE	Babe, I didn’t put a Stop on that Check. I will get that Money to you today. In Cash...

NOLA	... Do you understand that, that Check, not a Loan, but a Payment for my Fuckin’ Work, OK?!? That Check you wrote to Me was for My Rent, My Food, My Utilities, My Sustenance?! And most importantly, My Art! My Art, Jamie! And again...My Rent! Insufficient Funds?! Are you Fuckin’ kiddin’ me?! How am I going to pay my Rent Jamie?! I can barely afford what I have now! I’ma have to move outta Brooklyn, maybe Fuckin’ move outta New York! What kinda Shit is that, Jamie Overstreet? Mr. “Nola-I-Got- You?!” Mr.Provider?! I’m tired of people like you letting me down.

JAMIE	What does that mean?

NOLA	What do you think I am? Your Pay-for-Play Call Girl?! And By The By...Did your Wife have something to do with this?

JAMIE	No it’s not about that? It’s on me. I’ll fix it. Why would you say something like that? Is there somebody else?

NOLA	I hear you loud and clear. Now hear this Jamie...I want my fuckin’ painting back. Today! Wit Da Quickness! Yeah, I was on my grind. You know Dog Lovers tend to have deep pockets ... And so do tired Brooklyn Heights Parents... and when the Galleries don’t want to House your work, put your work up in front of ya House.

MARS	Dats Facts.

DIZZY	 (ad lib)

NOLA	Hey any of you want to buy Art, I got that exotic Native New York shit you can bring back Home? To London or Paris or wherever the fuck you’re from? Alright y’all two for 5-0, or you can grab em all 2 Hunnit. I see you Nola! And I Ain’t Mad Atcha!(ad lib)

REGGIE	See you later, Miss Darling.

HAKEEM	You ok, Miss Darling?

NOLA	See you tomorrow, Reggie and Hakeem. Hello, Ms. Moss. I just need a minute.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Raqueletta Moss knows how you feel, Miss Darling. Raqueletta Moss knows that it could be that time, or maybe the Mattress Rodeo put too much Yee! in your Ha! last night... Or Nola Darling has a case of Hustle-itis. When you are doing way too much to make ends meet.

NOLA	Bingo.

RAQUELETTA MOSS	Raqueletta Moss understands, she offers this free advice ... Miss Darling, you have to Work The Hustle. Adjust it to your personal temperature. Never let The Hustle work you. You’ll be ok. You are a Winner ... Nola.

NOLA	Thank you Ms. Moss. I don’t know. This week started off with me being Mad Happy and now I am just Mad. Angry.

MARS	Well let me tell you something to cheer you up ...your My Name Isn’t has racked up almost 50,000 Likes on Da ÔGram.

NOLA	Instagram is not paying my Rent.

MARS	It could.

NOLA	Yeah, If I’m ass’d out for some bullshit endorsement. The point is, I may have to move or leave Brooklyn altogether. I am tired of rocking The Ten Hustles just to survive.

MARS	What’s going on?

NOLA	Some Money I had and was dependin’ on for a Painting I sold just got ...well, the Check was stopped. It’s like Murphy’s Law, just seems that everything that could go Wrong has gone Wrong.

MARS	Yeah I know it doesn’t help that that Clown-Ass Onyx Person is trying to deface Your Art. But the good thing is... On several of the Murals people have crossed out Onyx’s name and have Bigged up the Original Artist...you. Even if they don’t know it’s you.

NOLA	That Fool’s Day will come.

MARS	I think you need to consider Lourdes and the Yoruba Cleansing.

NOLA	You think that could help me?

MARS	Remember what my Sister said about the Spider?

NOLA	Shit, is that a tat? But Lourdes is not doin’ those Cleansings for Free, Right?

MARS	Lourdes knows how I Feel about you and She will do me a Solid for something as important as this.

NOLA	You know how to Warm my Heart Mars.

MARS	I wish I could Warm something else.

NOLA	I wouldn’t ask you Guys if I really didn’t need it.

SEPTIMA	Baby, we would give you our last, but we just paid the Mortgage Con- Ed. Things are tight.

STOKELY	I am booked to do a New Jack Swing Gig this weekend. A Show with Al B. Sure!, Big Daddy Kane, and Jeff Redd. A nice piece of change. And that’s a Gift, Nola. Not a Loan. I know how hard it is for you to ask for Help.

NOLA	Stokely, I appreciate your generosity but it’s a Loan and I am going to pay you back.

SEPTIMA	That’s right Stoke. Listen to her. A Loan.

STOKELY	Okay Baby Girl. A Loan.

NOLA	Yeah, I don’t want any handouts. And Oh Yeah, I am getting a Cleansing today.

STOKELY	I thought you needed that Money to help pay your Rent. But you’re getting a Spa treatment now?

NOLA	No, not that kind of Cleansing. A Yoruba Cleansing.

STOKELY	That’s not a good look, Nola.

NOLA	What’s that mean?

STOKELY	It means, “Put not your Trust in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help. His breath goes forth, He returneth to his Earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. Happy is he that hath The GOD of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his GOD. Which made Heaven, and Earth, The Sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth Truth for ever.” Psalm 146.

SEPTIMA	You make me Sick with your Foolishness. It’s not like you’re some Paragon of Virtue. Don’t forget when you paid Tithes to the Coke boys in the Marcy Projects for years. Years.

STOKELY	You’re right. I have been a Hypocrite. But I Love my Daughter, and I know that Cleansing is not a good move for her. A Santeria Priest said he was going to put a curse on me more than 30 years ago at Medgar Evers College.

SEPTIMA	That time you told me you were registering for Classes in your Final year at Medgar Evers.

STOKELY	Hallway was crowded. It was the end of August and it was hot. Air conditioning had broken down. This Dude dressed in all White from Head to Toe.

NOLA	All White Everything, huh?

STOKELY	Exactly. Pristine. White Skully, White Jeans, White Ralph Lauren Polo Shirt, and White Rod Laver Clay Court Addidas. He and Two Young Women...they were also dressed in all White...jumped in front of me in line. I tapped my Man on the shoulder and asked him what was up? There is a line and you can’t jump in front of me. Nola, Tima, the entire hallway went silent. Dude in the Triple White gear looked at me as if I was Crazy and asked me if I knew who He was. I told him he was the Dude who jumped in front of me in line, and he needed to get to the Back of The Line. Dude in Triple White told me was going to put a Curse on me.

NOLA	Really? Were you scared.

STOKELY	No. I wasn’t scared. For some reason, out of nowhere, I recited that passage from Psalm 146. Dude in Triple White looked at me, looked at the Two Women with him, and then he and the Women left the Hallway. About a week later, I was walking into the entrance of Medgar Evers and someone taps me on the shoulder. Its the Santeria Priest. Dude looks at me for a moment as if he has seen a Ghost. Then he extends his hand to me and apologizes and We shake hands. I said to him, so was my Leg or Toes supposed to Fall Off? What happened to the Curse? Dude looked at me and said, “I saw something around you that day. Some kind of...Presence. And I couldn’t put the Curse on you.” I never saw that Guy again after that.

NOLA	That’s Your experience Stokely.

STOKELY	You know what Nola, you’re right. This is not a Battle of Beliefs. I shared a unpleasant experience with you, that’s all. And I care about you. But what you Worship is between you and GOD. That’s your Business.

NOLA	Dad, you couldn’t change The Way I feel, even if you wanted to.

STOKELY	Baby Gurl. Don’t I know that.

NOLA	Dead that Nick-Name Stokely. Please. Thanks for the Loan. I’ll pay you back soon. I’m out.

STOKELY	Okay Baby Girl. And I still Love you more than Life itself.

SEPTIMA	I Love You Stoke but you are so full of Shit sometimes.

STOKELY	I know Baby. I am constipated with regret, too.

LOURDES	Mojuba Lofi, Omi Tutu, Ana Tutu, Ile Tutu, Tutu Laroye..Elegua clear the path. Sarayeyo O Bakunlo/Sarayeyo O Bakunlo/Sarayeyo O Bakunlo/ Sarayeyo O Bakunlo... Sarayeyo O Bakunlo/Sarayeyo O Bakunlo/Sarayeyo O Bakunlo/ Sarayeyo O Bakunlo... These are the tribal marking of a Goddess. And you are a Queen, Nola. Let the energy of (?) be with you. How are you feelin’ Miss Darling?

NOLA	A little on edge. Also ... a sense of relief. Yeah.

LOURDES	Do you feel like some kind of burden has been lifted?

NOLA	No, more of a sense of Clarity. I think I know why I don’t trust myself to be loved.

LOURDES	I Feel you.

NOLA	Mos’ Definitely. So Tell me what I need to do to follow through.

Thank you for The Good Look on your Fee as well. I appreciate it.

LOURDES	You never Pay Me, you only Pay for The Work... What do you see in my Crazy Brother?

NOLA	Mars? I see Innocence. Hol’ up Maybe that’s not the Right Word.

LOURDES	Dat Crazy Ass Fool would give anyone the Shirt off his back.. Especially someone like you, who he feels so connected to ... Be kind when you let him go.

NOLA	I don’t think Mars is goin’ anywhere.

 

 
WINNY	Who the fuck there!?

JAMIE	It’s me fam.

WINNY	Sit down Jamie.

JAMIE	Well if it ain’t Nino Brownsville. I’m tired of being your Keeper, Winny.

WINNY	Fuck does dat mean?

JAMIE	It means living in the Past will destroy Ya Ass. It means you were a One-Hit Wonder who never got over it. It means you got some Talcum Powder on your Nose.

WINNY	Oh I forgot ... you’re Brooklyn Heights Gatsby now. Not Jay Gatz from Da ÔVille. Jay Gatz who used to blast dem Gatz.

JAMIE	I paid for all of that and still paying, because this Club is a Cash Cow for you.

WINNY	No... I paid for all of this. I was The Mathematician who solved your 99 problems. I sat down for you at Rikers. C-74. Under Da Muhfuckin’ Bing. Eight years.

JAMIE	Listen Fam, I am grateful for what you did for me but basically, you sat for a Job that you put me on to do, because you said, I was a Juvy, but as we both know that was a Long Time Ago in a Bleek Galaxy far, far away.

WINNY	What do you want... my Silent Partner?

JAMIE	I need Ten Stacks. Right now. And then I want out. That Shemekka Shit. You are Sloppy as Fuck Wit ya Business.

WINNY	You ain’t goin’ No-Where! Shemekka is the least of your problems! And you know exactly what I am talkin’ about Lil’ Cuz! All of this Shit is traceable to you.

JAMIE	Get outta my Face Winny. You used to scare a Nigga Back In Da Day. I’m tired of the Blackmail, I am tired of the Threats. You ain’t gonna tell on me, because then we all Fall Down, my Dude.

WINNY	You got a lot more to lose than me.

JAMIE	You sure about that? Don’t forget your Untouchables from back in the day. All your Young Guns from Brownsville and for situations, There Is No Statute Of Limitations.

WINNY	And like I said, We All Fall Down, Jamie. That’s why ain’t nobody talkin’ Ôbout nuthin’. You ain’t no real Soda, Young Boy.

JAMIE	Fall back.

WINNY	You ain’t no Real Soda. You used to talk like a White Boy back in the day...until I made you stop...and you Still ain’t got no Flava. You’re just Seltzer Water trying to get a Fizz.

JAMIE	I need those Ten Stacks... Please.

WINNY	That’s more fuckin’ like it.

JAMIE	Come in.

CHERYL	How are you?

JAMIE	Fine. And you?

CHERYL	Fine too.

JAMIE	It must be important for you to walk all the way down here to my ÒDungeon.Ó

CHERYL	In fact, it’s very important. Virgil wants to play us something.

JAMIE	How is our Sun doing?

CHERYL	Great but you need to ask him yourself.

JAMIE	Virgil!

VIRGIL	You ready?

JAMIE	I wuz Born Ready.

CHERYL/JAMIE	Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

CHERYL	Give me a kiss.

VIRGIL	Thanks.

CHERYL	Where did that come from?

JAMIE	Tell us, Sun.

VIRGIL	That stupid Video I did made me think about what we talked about on the stoop. Think about who I am and what this Country is about. Especially with this President. I did some research and found out the 3rd verse of the Star Spangled Banner has been left out. Francis Scott Key wrote a Mad Racist Verse endorsing Slavery so all this time We have been singing this National Anthem that is about our 246 Years of Enslavement - Not to end it but to continue it.

CHERYL	Virgil, I didn’t know this.

JAMIE	Me either.

VIRGIL	Google.

JAMIE	That’s why your Mother and I call you our SUN, spelled S-U-N because you shine like one.

VIRGIL	I have Latin homework.

CHERYL	That’s our best work.

JAMIE	Our Legacy.

CHERYL	Maybe I’ll cook some dinner tonight.

JAMIE	That would be nice.

CHERYL	Maybe you’ll clean up after?

JAMIE	I could do that.

MARS	What’s up Clo’?

CLORINDA	Hey Mars. How are you?

MARS	You gotta lotta goin’ on.

CLORINDA	So do you.

MARS	You need to let it out, better for your Health.

CLORINDA	What the Hell are you blathering about now? Let what out?

MARS	Nuthin’. Look, Nola needs your Help.

CLORINDA	What kind of Help?

MARS	Financial. She is in a bit of a bind. Financially.

CLORINDA	I help Nola all the time. I can only do so much.

MARS	Yo, you are so... Nola is going through a lot right now. From Money problems to that Wack-Ass, Bitch- Ass Onyx defacing her Street Art.

CLORINDA	What Street Art?

MARS	The My Name Is Street Murals of the Women that...

CLORINDA	Nola is responsible for that? Wow! Mars, wait?!

MARS	Call Nola! Talk to her! Don’t tell her I talked to you!
