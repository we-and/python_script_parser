STORYTELLER	Ever since Thomas the Tank Engine arrived on the island of Sodor, he had always longed to travel and see the World.

STORYTELLER	And one day...	

STORYTELLER	...he saw his chance!	

STORYTELLER	Thomas & Friends, Really Useful 	around the World!

STORYTELLER	Thomas goes to Sri Lanka!	

STORYTELLER	Thomas was very busy – taking some supplies to a Timber Depot.

STORYTELLER	He thought Sri Lanka was a beautiful country...

STORYTELLER	...But it was also hot, dry, and very dusty! <OUGHING> 

STORYTELLER	Thomas was chugging through a tea plantation...

STORYTELLER	...when he had to wait at a crossing. 

STORYTELLER	Thomas thought he could do with a good wash down. 

STORYTELLER	But he couldn’t stop. He was far too busy!

STORYTELLER	Thomas arrived at the Logging Depot. He was quite tired from working in the tropical heat.

STORYTELLER	And the air in the Logging Depot was filled with noise (coughing) – and saw dust!

STORYTELLER	Thomas had not gone very far from the Depot when there was trouble!

STORYTELLER	Thomas ran over a bit of broken track...

STORYTELLER	...and he was derailed. Poor Thomas!

STORYTELLER	But that’s when someone very special came to the rescue!

STORYTELLER	Three elephants! Three elephants line up alongside Thomas and stoop a little so their foreheads are up against him – and then they puuush him back on the track!

STORYTELLER	Thomas was very impressed! He’d seen one elephant before, on Sodor. So he remembered that an elephant could be very strong. 

STORYTELLER	But Thomas had never seen an elephant be Really Useful before! “Now I really need that wash”	
	
STORYTELLER	Now that’s what I call a wash down!” said Thomas. “Sri Lankan style!”
