(THE HEALER)



PILOT	Darling
 
WOMAN 	You’re back?
 
PILOT	Yes, it’s a long story.

WOMAN 	Coming! Just give me a minute. Don’t come in here, I have a surprise.
 
PILOT	Oh Surprise....

WOMAN 	Hi.

PILOT	Hi, two flights canceled, sent me home early for the weekend, after a ten hour wait. And what’s with the surprise?

WOMAN	Well... I forgot your birthday last month...

PILOT	Right…
 
ALEC	All done! Should just take a couple of hours to connect.  If you’ve got any problems you give me a call, yeah?

PILOT	Connect what?

ALEC	R34 chip, second generation, on your plasma TV. She not tell you? Gets you all Premier League matches and 5 Champions League first round games. I‘m gonna throw in a couple of more things on me but don’ let anyone know that, yeah? See ya!

PILOT	Oh my god! How great are you?

HENRY	I don't give a crap about your business, it’s not my damn problem. Tell him, if money is not here by Friday I’m closing your stupid store! Healer my ass.


ALEC	What did he want this time?

AMIR	Damn it Alec, he’s going to close the store.

ALEC	No he’s not. Relax.

AMIR	And what the hell happened yesterday? You left and never came back!

ALEC	Yes, sorry, I got caught up...

AMIR	You’re the one that fixes the stuff. If you’re not here how do we make money?

ALEC	40 quid? Is all we got?

AMIR	You are not betting that money.

ALEC	Lend me ten more.

AMIR	No Alec!
 
ALEC	Please! one horse, one race, ok? I have got a winner, I’ve done it before.

AMIR	And you’ve lost everything before!
 
ALEC	It’s 7 to 1 and no one knows he runs like the wind. It’s the last time.

AMIR	That’s it. I quit Se acabó, me despido

ALEC 	Come on Amir, don’t do this... Amir!
 
AMIR	Look, I don’t know what happened to you Alec, you changed. You’re a good man, but…. you need some help.

ALEC	I’m fine! I can fix ….. Amir.

AMIR	Where’s your other shoe?

ALEC	I’m Alec Bailey. I’ve got a phone call

LADY	Yes, right this way

BANK EXECUTIVE	I imagine you must have been quite surprised to get our call about meeting today.

ALEC	Yes, I...

BANK EXECUTIVE	Seeing as you bounced five checks when you had your account here, not to mention your Visa, which had to be cancelled twice because you’ve managed somehow to keep ramping up charges

ALEC	Look I payed all that already,. Why am I here

BANK EXECUTIVE		There is someone who is willing to eradicate all your debts. 

ALEC	Is this a joke?

BANK EXECUTIVE	It should be. It’s not.

ALEC	Right, Who is this person?

BANK EXECUTIVE	A family member.

ALEC	Ah! Family member, right. Well, both my parents are long dead, as is my only brother and the last I heard of a relative was on my first communion. So how are you explain that?

BANK EXECUTIVE	Well this is an uncle you’ve never met. Es un tío

ALEC	That’s convenient? Qué casualidad 

BANK EXECUTIVE	Mr. Raymond Heacock

ALEC	That’s my mother’s maiden name.

BANK EXECUTIVE	He will be at his private club, table under his name, today at 1 p.m. Sharp.

RAYMOND	Oh! Thank you, Svetlana. Alec…. Sit down! Hungry?

ALEC	A little bit, yeah.

RAYMOND	Good, I’ve ordered you the escargot, and the sole, they do it well here.  He won’t be having any. You must be curious? Ask away.

ALEC	You’re my uncle?

RAYMOND	Indeed. Your dear mother was my sister.

ALEC	How come I’ve never heard of you?

RAYMOND	Sadly, we rarely spoke, there were a couple of things we couldn’t agree on.

ALEC	Such as?

RAYMOND	That one I’m not prepared to answer.

ALEC	Bank said that you’re going to give me all this money?

RAYMOND	That’s not exactly right. Can I be open with you? 

ALEC	Sure!

RAYMOND	Frankly, you’re a disgrace to the family. You have a gambling habit that will probably either get you killed or the very least maimed. You’ve never married and you’re sleeping around as you just discovered your willy. As for your engineering degree your business is a disaster.

ALEC	What am I doing here?

RAYMOND	I am prepared to pay off all your debts. Every single one of them. Which at this moment in time amount to exactly 88,950 pounds. So, you see? It’s not all bad. Of course... I’ll want something in exchange.

ALEC	What?

RAYMOND	I want you to move abroad, leave England

ALEC	Leave England? Where?

RAYMOND	You’ll be living in Nova Scotia. That’s Canada, if you don’t know where it is.

ALEC	Why?

RAYMOND	Well we’ve had family living there for the past 200 years, and frankly, well, we are getting a bit thin on the ground, it’s a tradition. I want to maintain … Napkin! Thank you! 365 days, not a day less. And then, if you are not happy, well, you can always return to England then, pick up your debaucherous life where you left off. Oh, by the way, you’ll be leaving Monday H

ALEC	That’s in two days!

RAYMOND	Yes. Hopefully your friends won’t kill you by then. Now, here’s your ticket to Halifax, you will be met at the airport by a man named Frederick. He’s worked for me for a number of years, he looks after my house where you’ll be staying. Now, there’s work papers and a visa that lasts a year.


ALEC	What I’m supposed to do there?

RAYMOND	You might as well try working

ALEC	Doing what?

RAYMOND	Not my problem, dear boy. So Monday 13:05 your plane leaves. Be on it, or the deal is off. I really must go. Enjoy your meal, it’s all paid for. I’m really sorry about your brother, such a shame. By the way, Alec, ever noticed anything strange about yourself? Odd?

ALEC	Odd?

RAYMOND	Never mind. Good luck.

GREG	Thanks So I say, you get the plane ticket, get it refunded. Should be close to what you owe those Russians. And tell your uncle to bugger off.

ALEC	What’s wrong with you? I’m not going to rob my uncle, only just met him! Besides, he’s the only family member I’ve got.

GREG	You checked, right? Can’t get it refunded, right? No te dejan

ALEC	Yeah, I checked, but that’s besides the point. I’m not going to go to Canada, this is ridiculous Así es

GREG	All right, Can I think if Charlie was here he would  tell you to go... creo que si Charlie estuviese aquí te diría que fueses…

ALEC	Don’t talk about my brother!

GREG	Pardon me

ALEC	I’m serious, don’t talk about Charlie!! 

GREG	OK, I’m sorry...

ALEC	Shit! 

THUG 1	So, Alec, if we are drinking beer with friends, it means you have the money for Mr  Misic? Si 

GREG	Leave him alone, right? He’s going to get you your bloody money!¡

ALEC	Oh, shit!

THUG 1	Alec, playing games…

ALEC	Oh! Shit!

PRIEST 	Tell me your sins, my son....

ALEC	Oh Jesus Christ! 

PRIEST	We’ll have to add those to whatever else you confess....Eso lo 

ALEC	No, please. Shhhh... I’m just hiding here, Ok?

PRIEST	This is a sacred sacrament, get out!

ALEC	No please, they’ll kill me.

PRIEST	Who wants to harm you?

ALEC	Nobody, just lower your voice!	

PRIEST	Now tell me what you’ve done!

ALEC	I owe them money

PRIEST	Which you stole?

ALEC	No! I gambled it.

PRIEST	Do you repent?

ALEC	What?

PRIEST	Do you ask for God’s forgiveness?

ALEC	I don’t believe in God.

PRIEST	Right, I’m going out there....

ALEC	NO, no! I am sorry, I am Sorry...

PRIEST	Not to me...

ALEC	Fine, fine. I’m sorry, I’m sorry God...

PRIEST	Ladies and Gentlemen, we have to close now. This is the house of the Lord, I don't believe either one of you is praying, so go about your business elsewhere, please Señoras y caballeros, tenemos que cerrar. La iglesia va a cerrar desalojen por favor 

ALEC	Thanks

PRIEST	Stay for a while, those men aren't going to go away just like that. Come here and tell me what is going on with you. Maybe I can give you some advice.

ALEC	No father I just...

PRIEST	Sit down! You owe me this at least. Sit and talk. It seems your life is not going well, is it? I think you should move to Canada. I think it’s God´s way of giving you a second chance.

ALEC	Trust me, my uncle doesn’t work for God.


PRIEST	Let me tell you a story...

ALEC	No, please Father, I’m going to go.

PRIEST	There was this parish priest in a church and the rain was so bad for months that the town was flooding. And people were forced to leave but the priest said, “God will save me!” So he stayed behind.When the water was at his waist they sent him the police to evacuate him and then they sent him the firemen and the army with a boat and always he refused, believing that God would be the one to save him. And so he drowned. And when he come face-to-face with God he complained, he said: “God, why did you abandon me?” And God said: “I sent the police and the firemen and even the army with a boat but still you would not listen” I think God sent your uncle. Go to Canada.

ALEC	That's me.

FRED	I am Frederick. Welcome to Nova Scotia.

ALEC	So, are you from Nova Scotia? ¿Así que eres de Nueva Escocia?

FRED	Yep.

ALEC	And how long have you known my uncle?

FRED 	43 years.

ALEC	Wow! I only just met him.


FRED	So, there’s a few things about this house you should know, sometimes the furnace breaks down, let me know if it does but don't kick it. Fridge is not great but your food won’t spoil.You’ve one phone. Washer is in the back. Don’t overload it, it will flow. Bed is made, it’s a bit squeaky, you'll get used to that. Fresh linen and towels in the closet. Got any questions?

ALEC	Yeah, Is there any internet?

FRED	No

ALEC	Where is the nearest town?

FRED	Lunenburg, about four kilometres east.

ALEC	How am I supposed to get there?

FRED	Well, your uncle asked me to find you a car. An old fishing buddy of mine sold me his truck. Should be delivered in the morning.

ALEC	Great, thank you.

FRED	Well, thank me when you see it.

ALEC	How am I supposed to reach you?

FRED	I'll be around. My number is on the wall.

ALEC	So, I guess this me, for a year You got to be kidding me...No me fastidies.. Jesus!

CECILIA	Nice car! I hope you like fishing.

ALEC	Oh, I don’t fish. This thing shouldn’t be on the road. It’s not really mine...

CECILIA	Fred bought it, I know. You must be Alec. 

ALEC	Yeah!

CECILIA	I’m Cecilia, I know your uncle, he told me you might be coming. Are you jet-lagged?

ALEC 	A bit…

CECILIA	Buy you a coffee?

ALEC	Sure

CECILA	It’s just around the corner

ALEC	Is that going to be alright? 

CECILIA	Yeah, ????? I don’t see anyone stealing that! What brought you all the way here?

ALEC	I...just wanted a change, really. It was the now or never kind of thing. What do you do?

CECILIA	I’m a vet. 

ALEC	Oh yeah?

CECILIA	Yeah, mostly farm animals. I moved here after college. And your profession is?

ALEC	I fix things, I’m a mechanical engineer. So I have an uncanny ability to fix anything electrical.

CECILIA	Really!? You know what? You should put an ad in the local weekly newspaper, it’s like the bible here. Everyone reads it.

ALEC	Oh yeah! I mean...really...that would really help me out. I kind of need the money.

CECILIA	They’re closed today because they publish tomorrow. But I could maybe get your ad squeezed in, the editor is my neighbour.

ALEC	Yeah?

CECILIA	Yeah!

ALEC	That’ll be great, thank you.

CECILIA	Ok, what do you want it to say? Vale, ¿qué quieres que ponga en el anuncio?

ALEC	The Healer, Alec Bailey, arrives in Lunenburg. I fix anything electrical that’s broken.  Is that too long?

CECILIA	No, I’m going to put your uncle’s house as the address. The Healer, I like that.

ALEC	Yeah?

CECILIA	Yeah!

ALEC	I had a shop with the same name back home.

FATHER MALLOY	Hi Cecilia...

CECILIA	Father Malloy. This’s Alec, Raymond’s nephew, he just got here.

FATHER MALLOY	Oh! Welcome to our community. Your uncle is a very generous man. 
	
ALEC	Is he?

FATHER MALLOY	Will I be seeing you at Sunday mass?

ALEC	No, I’m actually a Buddhist.

FATHER MALLOY	A Buddhist?

ALEC	Yeah!

FATHER MALLOY	And how that come about?

ALEC	Well, just like you found Jesus, I found Buddha.

FATHER MALLOY	And where was that exactly? I mean, where you found him?

ALEC	I found….

CECILIA	Father, give the man a break, he just got here.

FATHER MALLOY	I’m just kidding, good luck with that. I’ll see you Cecilia.

CECILIA	Bye... Are you really a Buddhist?

ALEC	No, I’ve been to Thailand. So, are you married?

CECILIA	No, thank you. No, I actually happen… to like… what you like.

ALEC 	Really? Wow, That’s great!, I mean, maybe I can take you for dinner or something.

CECILIA	No, I like women.

ALEC	What? Ah, you’re a lesbian?

CECILIA	Yep! That’s what they call it.

ALEC	Sorry

CECILIA	Batman, what is it? What’s going on? That’s so bizarre. Are you good with animals?

ALEC	I don’t know

CECILIA	Well if fixing things doesn’t work out, then you can always come work with me. I could use the help.

ALEC	Yeah?

CECILIA	Yeah!!

ALEC	Ok

CECILIA	Ok Hey… no, no ,no

ALEC	Oh shit! ¡Oh, mierda!

POLICE	(Tom) Beer

ALEC	I didn’t mean to, just suddenly stop here…

POLICE	(Tom) Beer I’m going to need your license and registration.

ALEC	I’ve only just moved here. I've been lent this truck. 

POLICE	(Tom) I know who you are. You are a Heacock, Raymond’s nephew.

ALEC	Yeah! Oh, you must know my uncle.

POLICE	(Tom) The papers are in the vehicle, yes or no?

ALEC	Ahhh

POLICE	(Tom) I’m giving you a citation for parking on the side of the road, with no emergency lights and for drinking and driving.

ALEC	Wow wow, I was choking on a chip  

TOM	And I don’t give a royal crap. Welcome to Nova Scotia And when you speak with your uncle, tell him, Tom sends his regards.

ALEC	Water is cold!

LOUISE	Excuse me…Sorry, the front door was open. I hope you don’t mind. We’ll just be waiting in the sitting room.

ALEC	What are you all doing here?

JOSH	The ad you placed, The Healer? el anuncio, ¿El Curandero?

ALEC	Oh!… oh! Give me a minute. Right, who’s first??

LOUISE	We are.

ALEC	Great. How can I help?

LOUISE	Well, I have arthritis and it’s getting worse each day. And my husband, well his hearing is practically shot. So annoying. So can you help us?

ALEC	Sorry, there seems to be a bit of mistake here.

MARY	But you’re a healer? It says so in the ad

ALEC	No, no, no… It's see that my con phrase. It’s my slogan. I fix electrical things.

JOSH	Ad says you heal.

NEWSPAPER	“THE HEALER, ALEC BAILEY, ARRIVES IN LUNENBURG. I FIX ANYONE.”

ALEC	I didn’t say that.

LOUISE	Well it’s printed right there. And frankly we were a bit surprised you would bring it up this way. Being that it’s supposed to be a secret.

ALEC	What do you mean a secret?
 
MARY	So, my blood sugar is off the charts. Doctor says I’m going to need insulin at this point. I’m so sick of dieting, it does nothing!

JOSH	Yeah, I’m like a factory of kidney stones, man... One a month, sometimes two… I could feel one coming as off yesterday.

ALEC	This...The ad is wrong, I can't, I am not a healer. I don't heal people.

LOUISE	He doesn’t want to help us.

LARRY	What?
 
LOUISE	He doesn’t want to help us!

LARRY	Why not?

ALEC	Because I’m not a doctor!

LARRY	What?

JOSH	You’re not the chosen one?
 
ALEC	What are you talking about? 

MARY	Why would you lie like that then?

ALEC	Look… It’s a mistake, a misprint. If you have anything electrical, anything at all, I’ll be happy to look at it. That’s what I do. My truck broke down. If someone could drive me to Cecilia's, I’ll clear all this up. 

JOSH	Didn’t you say you fix electrical things?

ALEC	Yeah

JOSH	Fix your car

LOUISE	So unfair. I really thought my prayers had been answered.

MARY	I can take you to Cecilia’s, if you’ll do something for me.
 
ALEC	Sure.

MARY	My boyfriend has been procrastinating about asking to marry me. Just needs a little push. So, if I say something that doesn’t make much sense when he’s around... You just follow my lead? 

ALEC	Yeah. I can do that. When do you want me to do that?

MARY	Now. He’s the one that drove me here. So, Philip, this’s Alec and I go way back. How long has it been Alec?

ALEC	A while.

MARY	Gosh, doesn’t feel that way. It’s amazing how, for a woman, first impressions with a man are just... so, important. I was lucky you were so sweet Alec. So gentle.

PHILIP	How long are you staying?

ALEC	A year.
 
MARY	A whole year! That is so great. One day we should go swimming at the lake, like we used to. Remember that time my mom nearly caught us butt naked and we hid for a whole hour behind a rock?
ALEC	No, that I don’t remember that.

MARY	It’s fine Alec, Philip understands. We all have pasts. Right hun?

PHILIP	Sure.
 
MARY	See you soon, Alec. So happy you are here! Call me, anytime. What?
 
PHILIP	Nothing.

ALEC	They misprinted the ad! This isn’t funny, I’ve already had four potential clients in my house: one with arthritis, one deaf, some nut waitress and some dude with a kidney stone factory….

CECILIA	I’ll have them reprint it again but it won’t be out until next week.
 
ALEC	I’ve only been here for two days, I’ve got a ticket yesterday for 250 dollars by this jerk of police man.

CECILIA	Tom? Tom pulled you over? Tom’s ex-wife had a crush on Raymond, rumour has they had a thing. So Tom tries to make your uncle’s life impossible when he’s here.

ALEC	All right. And then now I’m the target, right?

CECILIA	What is it with you and animals? My dog loves you, the sheep are following us.

ALEC	I think you`ve got some strange animals. I wanted to ask you, I know it’s cheeky but the other day, were you serious about the job offer? 

CECILIA	Yeah! Of course!

ALEC	Great!  When do I start?

CECILIA	Right now!

ALEC	What was that? 

CECILIA	Just follow me! Oh my God!

ALEC	What?

CECILIA	This cow has been having difficulty since yesterday, in constant pain.

ALEC	What’s wrong with her?

CECILIA	She’s pregnant.

ALEC	You think she’s going to lose the baby?

CECILIA	No. I think it’s about to happen right now.

ALEC	Giving birth? I think I should probably just give her some privacy.

CECILIA	Alec, grab the gloves! Do you want a job, or not? Grab the gloves Alec, Come on! Ok, Ok. Easy girl.

ALEC	Oh, my God! What are those sticks coming out of her tunnel?

CECILIA	The legs! Ok we’re going to pull, ready? Ready? Go! Pull!

ALEC	Ahhh! Ahh!
 
CECILIA	Ok!! You know. It’s not usually like that, it's actually... 

ALEC	I don’t want to talk about it. It’s just the way she was staring at me

CECILIA	I’m so sorry... !

ALEC	Seriously?

CECILIA	You 've some visitors...

ALEC	No, I have more clients. 

FRANK	Mr. Bailey, can you see us now?
 
CECILIA	Frank, Leslie, what’s this about?

LESLIE	My little Rebecca, Cecilia, you know what’s wrong. She’s nearly five and she hasn’t spoken for the past year.

CECILIA	I’m so sorry, the ad was misprinted. He isn’t some kind of healer.

FRANK	You’re not the healer?

ALEC	I fix electrical things, not people.

LESLIE	Can you at least try?

CECILIA	Leslie, he can’t help you. I’m going to try and fix this. I’m so sorry. I’ll see you tomorrow at 10. It’s really my fault, I misprinted the ad.  



FATHER MALLOY	Alec Bailey! ….. Alec Bailey! I want a word with you. How dare you come to this peaceful community and try and scam these people!

ALEC	What the hell are you talking about?

FATHER MALLOY	A healer? Is that the best ploy you could come up with?
 
ALEC	It was a mistake or I'd misprinted the ad!!
 
FATHER MALLOY	Baloney! I know how these schemes work. Now I get the whole town talking about it. Of course you say it’s a mistake.  

ALEC	I’m telling you the ad is bullshit.

FATHER MALLOY	Hey, don’t you use foul language with me!

ALEC	Well then listen to me and help me tell these people that I am not a healer!

LAURA	Paula, come on…

PAULA	Ok, go Ok, ya.

LAURA	As we can see, the oak trees and forest are thick with mosses, still moist from spring ….

ALEC	Oh, no! no!

PAULA	Sounds like a bad argument.

FATHER MALLOY	And propagate your publicity? No sir, I am going to report you to the authorities!

ALEC	You know what? Get off my property! You’re giving me a headache.

FATHER MALLOY	Your uncle would be ashamed of you. Don’t you walk away from me! I’m talking to you.

ALEC	Don’t touch me!

FATHER MALLOY	Help me...

ALEC	Oh, shit!

PAULA	Laura, Check it out. Oh! My God!

LAURA	Is that Father Malloy?

ALEC	Don’t you die on me!

LAURA	Oh, my God, he murdered Father Malloy. What’s he doing?

PAULA	He’s probably going to bury him...Dear Jesus! Let's get out of here

LAURA	No, wait!

LAURA AND PAULA	Oh my gosh!

LAURA	That guy is an animal

PAULA	I got it all on camera. Let’s go see Tom! Lo he grabado
 
ALEC	That’s not bad! *Finalmente Oh, Shit! Somebody put a curse on me! Help! Help!

FRED	Hey Alec, I didn’t know you were the healer. I just saw the ad.

ALEC	Where’s the newspaper office? I need to talk to them!

MARY	And would you like the special juice of the day? It’s blackberry apple.

LOUISE	Oh Sure! Larry! Would you like to try the juice of the day? It’s blackberry apple.

LARRY	Why are you screaming at me?  That will be grand Mary.

LOUISE	Larry, can you hear me?

LARRY	Yeah, what is it? Sí, qué pasa?

LOUISE	Larry, you got your hearing back?

LARRY	I think I did...

LOUISE	I didn’t have any pain this morning, I thought it was just a lucky break.

MARY	Dear Jesus!

WOMAN	They say Leslie’s daughter is like a chatterbox after they saw Alec.

MARY	I’m going to get a blood tested, maybe I’m better too.

OLD MAN	You all really think he is the one?

LOUISE	He must be the one. Tiene que

MARY	Would you like some coffee, hun? ¿Quieres café, cariño?

PHILIP	No, no, thanks!

MARY	Hey guys! Look, that’s him!

PEOPLE	Come on, Let’s go Where is he?

CHARLES	We printed what we were told!

ALEC	Bullshit!! Now, I need you to send a clear message tomorrow saying that you made a mistake. Una 

CHARLES	We don’t print again until next Tuesday. Vale pero 

ALEC	Don’t care! just make an exception!

LARRY	My dear man, thank you so very much! I can hear!

LOUISE	I never should have doubted of you, I haven’t had any pain since yesterday.

WOMAN	And Rebecca is doing so well, you are a blessing to this town!

MARY	Has my blood sugar corrected itself?

PHILIP	I don’t buy this crap! There are no healers and this guy has no powers. This is ridiculous, Mary. Esto es un engaño

ALEC	Thank you! Thank you. Finally someone with some common sense!

MARY	Oh my god Philip! Your stutter is gone!

PHILIP	My stutter... my stutter is gone!

CHARLES	How much are you charging?

LARRY	How much do we owe you?

ALEC	Nothing! Nothing! You know why? Because real healers here don't exist! Next week, He’s gonna print that I am Superman, but I still won’t be able to freaking fly! I just want to be left alone!

PEOPLE	But he heals people

CECILIA	You’re almost two hours late!

ALEC	I’ve got a great excuse, ok? And you still want me to work for you or not?

CECILIA	Yeah, sure

ALEC	Great! Who’s giving birth today? Anyone?

CECILIA	I know you’ve had some bad luck since you got here.

ALEC	Bad luck? This place is a living nightmare, the people in here are crazy and I have this constant blistering headache and….

CECILIA	What?

ALEC	It’s my birthday

CECILIA	Happy birthday, Alec. Do you like Pinot Noir?

ALEC	It’s really beautiful here.

CECILIA	Oh, you finally notice.  See, it’s not all bad.

ALEC	Thank you. I needed this.

CECILIA	Happy birthday, Alec.

ALEC	So, do you have a girlfriend? Dime

CECILIA	No, not at the moment.

ALEC	What if you’re wrong about all of this? I was thinking, you know, I bet if we did an experiment you and I and I kiss you, maybe you might change your mind. You know what I think?

CECILIA	Interesting, I think we should do an experiment before...

ALEC	Ok

CECILIA	Where maybe you kiss Fred and see if you change your mind.

ALEC	Ouch, am I that bad?

CECILIA	Yeah! You know what is weird? Rebecca, that couple’s child, has started talking after she met you. From what I hear, you’re having some sort of effect on people.

ALEC	It’s this people in this town, they are just waiting for an excuse to wake up from their boring existence and find miracles where there are none. That little girl was about to speak, I know it.

TOM	Alec Bailey, we have you surrounded. Get down on your knees with your hands behind your head…

CECILIA	Tom? Is that you?
  
TOM	Cecilia!! Cecilia, get away from him! He’s dangerous! Alec, Alec get down… on your knees with your hands behind your head. I won’t tell you again, get down on your knees.
 
ALEC	It’s a ticket! I’m going to pay it....

POLICE	I thought I had the safety on

CECILIA	Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?

TOM	Alec Bailey, you are under arrest for the murder of Father Malloy. Anything that you say will be held against you on a court of law.

CECILIA	What?!
 
ALEC	I didn’t kill him, anybody. He had a heart attack and I left him at the church.

TOM	You are one cynical bastard. We have the whole thing on videotape, Cecilia. He's killed him and now he’s probably buried him somewhere.
 
ALEC	He walked on his two feet into the church!

CECILIA	Here's got to be somewhere, Tom! 

TOM	We have an eyewitness, we have video footage of him pounding on the poor man. Where’s the body?

ALEC	There’s no body! He’s out there, just go and find him!

TOM	Father Malloy is nowhere to be found. Are you that stupid? Even his car is still at your property.

ALEC	Cecilia! I didn’t do anything, find Father Malloy, Cecilia. I’m innocent!
 
TOM	Now this is a little something that I got together for Nova Scotia PD. I got to warn you, what you’re about to see here is not a pretty gruesome Now, what we got here? What is that? It’s a shovel… listen up… you tell me at the end of it if you think that Father Malloy is still alive. Yeah!

CECILIA	Wow!

TOM	Thanks.

CECILIA	No, listen, there has to be some sort of logical explanation. This man is not an assassin….

TOM	Then where’s the priest? He took the body, he put in the back of this truck and he took it somewhere. I mean this man is a sick cruel bastard and you’re just lucky that he didn't hurt you too.
CECILIA	What’s going to happen to him?

TOM	NSPD is coming down to pick him up in the morning. This is major.

CECILIA	Please, let me talk to him.. Please Tom. Please, let me talk to him.

TOM	5 minutes and don´t you dare get close 

ALEC	Did you find him?

CECILIA	No. I’ve looked for him everywhere. Fred’s looking too.

ALEC	What’s going to happen with me?

CECILIA	They’re taking you to a Halifax prison. Did you speak to a lawyer?

ALEC	No! I don’t want a lawyer!

CECILIA	This is serious Alec.

ALEC	I didn’t do anything. He had a heart attack at my house, I managed to get him in the truck, I drove him to town and then, he woke up, I mean, walked in to the church! What?

CECILIA	I just watched the video…. Father Malloy looks very dead.

ALEC	Tell me about it! He freaked me out! I thought...You don’t believe me! Do you?

CECILIA	I do, it’s just so implausible what he would just get up and walk on way after all that is… 

ALEC	Yes, He did.

CECILIA	I believe you, Alec. I’m just trying…

ALEC	Just get out!

CECILIA	What? I will find Father Malloy

TOM	You want a shovel? Do you want to use the bathroom before I lock up for tonight? Father Malloy was my very good friend.


CHIEF	They’re here!! Están aquí!

PETER	Tom

TOM	Hey, Pete!

PETER	How are you doing? Good, good, good. Who would have thought you would have any of this in Lunenburg. The guy is from Britain, isn't he?

TOM	Just arrived, been here less than a week. Still haven’t found where he buried the body.

PETER	We’ll find the body. We’ve got Alcapone here. He’s the best dog I`ve got, let me tell you. This boy will sniff things other dogs only dreamed they’ll find.

ALEC	Hey, am I free to go?

TOM	Put your hands on your head now! I will maze the shit out of you. *Te rocio con esta mierda

ALEC	Ok, Ok.

TOM	How did you get free and come out here?

ALEC	The door was open, my cuffs were loose!

TOM	Bullshit!

PETER	Let AlCapone free, go get him. Go get him, boy. Get him boy. suelta a Alcapone

LUNENBURG COP	Lunenburg Police.

JIM	Tom…

TOM	Dam it man, not now Jim.

PETER	I want you to get on the ground slowly or I will put a bullet through your head!

JIM	Tom...I’m sorry but it’s Father Malloy on the phone for you. Tom..

ALEC	I told you!!!

PETER	Shut up, and don’t move!

TOM	Who is this? But we saw a video where you were…. Right…

PETER	What the hell have you done, Tom?

TOM	Thank you. He’s innocent. That was Father Malloy calling to confirm it, he’s fine.

ALEC	What the hell is wrong with all of you?...  I told you I was innocent!

PETER	What the hell have you done now, Tom?

TOM	You saw the video, I mean, there’s no way he was still alive..  

PETER	We all saw the video Tom, what are you Steven Spielberg now?

TOM	There’s more footage, I mean, look! Watch this!

PETER	Let’s go Henry

TOM	Pete!

PETER	Don’t waste my time again, Tom.

JIM	You… want a coffee with those little cookies you like?

TOM	Shut up, can’t just shut up…?


ALEC	Father Malloy! Where the hell were you? They put me in jail thinking you were dead!

FATHER MALLOY	I know, I’m sorry. I came as soon as I heard.
 
ALEC	You didn't come soon enough, did you?

FATHER MALLOY	I’m sorry for not believing in you. Wait.

ALEC	What?

FATHER MALLOY	I have a confession to make, I lost my faith about two years ago. Actually, stopped believing that God could exist.
.
ALEC	²And you accuse me of lying to these people?

FATHER MALLOY	I didn’t have a heart to tell the community, so I just kept playing my role which is what I was, the priest.

ALEC	That’s pathetic. 

FATHER MALLOY	But I died yesterday, I’m sure of it. And nothing should have brought me back and yet… Look …when I moved to Lunenburg I heard stories, rumours, Healers. I just dismissed them as nonsensical myths. I believe,  you have a gift. A God given gift which brought me back and gave me a second chance.

ALEC	Are you serious!!

FATHER MALLOY	I got my faith back, I want to thank you for that. Alec…. Son there’s no denying it, you are a healer.

ALEC	And I’m done, I'm done. You are.... You are clinically insane. One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret not to be told. This is a key for the house. What is this shit?

RAYMOND	It’s your destiny. Hello, Alec.

ALEC	It’s you!

RAYMOND	We need to talk. It’s a lot to take in.

ALEC	What the hell is going on here? Why did you put my name on the wall?

RAYMOND	Calm down

ALEC	Don’t tell me to calm down! What is this place? Who are these people?

RAYMOND	These are your ancestors. That one there, behind you, was the last one chosen, he was my father.

ALEC	Is this some kind of religious sect?

RAYMOND	You have the family gift, the gift of Healing. It skips a generation.

ALEC	Oh my god, you’re all insane!

RAYMOND	Alec, since you’ve been here, you’ve helped a young girl find her speech, an old man his hearing…

ALEC	It wasn’t me!

RAYMOND	Father Malloy died and is back. I’ve seen the video.

ALEC	But I didn’t do anything. I didn’t even touch those people.

RAYMOND	You don't have to touch them. If you are nearby and someone is meant to be cured, then they will be. Like it or not, you’ve been chosen.

ALEC	Who chose me?

RAYMOND	Whatever you want to call it. The big chief, Mr. Creator, the supreme being...

ALEC 	God?

RAYMOND	That's the more popular name.

ALEC	I don’t believe in God.

RAYMOND	Pick another name. The headaches are part of it, but they will go away. Why don’t we go outside and get some fresh air? Alec!

ALEC	No, no stay away from me.

PICTURE	Welcome to the family, Alec.

ALEC	Hey…

CECILIA	Hey, are you ok? 

ALEC	Yeah! I had a nightmare. I think. Creo What’s going on?

CECILIA	It wasn’t a dream. Everything Raymond told you is true.

ALEC	You knew about all this?

RAYMOND	Throughout all the healers, Cecilia’s family, has always been among the few that knew. Our two families are connected.

ALEC	Why me?

RAYMOND	I thought it was worth the shot and if it wasn't you at least I would have helped you. 

ALEC	Help me? You gave me two days!

RAYMOND	The gift can only be activated per se, when the chosen one is here and on his thirtieth birthday.

ALEC	I just turned thirty.

CECILIA	Alec, have you recently noticed that animals are fascinated with you? This morning when you where detained, how did you get out?

ALEC	The handcuffs, they were loose... The door just opened...

RAYMOND	It is written: The healer will not be bound by any man, he will be free.

ALEC	But we made up the name for the shop in London, “The Healer”

RAYMOND	Yes. That was a bit strange, but possibly more than a coincidence.

ALEC	Oh, and then the ad in the paper? Was that also a coincidence? Y

CECILIA	No. I misprinted it that on purpose.

ALEC	Why would you do that? ¿Por qué hiciste eso?

CECILIA	I did what I had to do, Alec.

ALEC	Do I have a choice in any of these? Tengo yo elección

RAYMOND	Yes, yes, you do. Tonight, the day after your birthday, you must decide. Unless you reject the gift before midnight, it is bound to you for life.
 
ALEC	Well, I don’t want it.

CECILIA	Alec, you could help so many people...

ALEC	I don’t want anything to do with this!

RAYMOND	This is what we are going to do. We'll leave you to think about it. We've got about 6 hours. We’ll be back before midnight.

ALEC	And then what, you’ll sacrifice a goat and bathe me in its blood, is that right?

RAYMOND	That's always an option. No Alec. Midnight will come, and if you decide to accept... we’ll open a good bottle of wine to celebrate it. Eso podría haber sido una buena opción.

CECILIA	What do you think?

RAYMOND	I think it went quite well. It’s nearly midnight.

ALEC	I don’t want it. I never chose any of this.

CECILIA	Alec, I think that you’re making a mistake.

ALEC	That’s my final answer.

RAYMOND	You know what? Charlie would have wanted it.

ALEC	Don’t you dare talk about my brother!

RAYMOND	Why not? It’s the truth, he should’ve been the next healer. He had a sense of responsibility!

ALEC	Responsibility? He didn't even know you existed! And where were you when my mother died? Ah? Responsabilidad? Si ni siquiera sabía que exisitías! Dónde estabas cuando murió mi madre? Eh?

RAYMOND	I loved my sister, I just could not show myself.

ALEC	Oh that's bullshit! Eso es mentira

CECILIA	We keep it secret until the time is right.

RAYMOND	That’s the way it works. Esas son las reglas 

ALEC	This is the way it works on my end. I am not going to play Harry Potter for you both. So, what happens now? I go back to London and you don’t pay my debts, right? 

RAYMOND	No, no, I am a man of my word but you do have to remain here for a full year.

CECILIA	You do realize that you can’t take this back?

ALEC	Please, I don’t want it.

CECILIA	Midnight

RAYMOND	I need you to go into town.

ALEC	Now?
 
RAYMOND	Yes, everyone is gathered in the church. They are waiting for you.

CECILIA	It’s tradition.

ALEC	They think I’ve accepted the gift?

CECILIA	They wanted you to.

ALEC	Shit. This doesn’t end, does it?

RAYMOND	It will, after you've told them your decision.

ALEC	Fine, I am going.

CECILIA	I’ll go with you. It’ll be easier.

ALEC	Wow, wow, wait !!! Is this really necessary?

CECILIA	They’re all waiting. Everyone. Children too.

ALEC	They’re going to hate me. Why can’t you just tell them?

CECILIA	Is the least that you can do, don’t you think?

ALEC	Short and sweet. Short and sweet.

CECILIA	Hello everyone, I know that it’s late but Alec has been kind enough to come and talk to us.

ALEC	Look, I’m sorry to say that…. I won't be your healer. Look, this whole thing, has been so... strange and unexpected. I just can’t handle it, so...I hope you understand and…. I’ll be gone by next spring, so...

LESLIE	Thank you Alec for our Rebecca. She talks so much I want to shut her up!

LARRY	And I’d forgotten how annoying my wife’s voice is when she yelling at me.

MARY	Just got my tests back, sugar's back to normal. Thank you Alec.

JOSH	First time peeing without praying the rosary. Thanks, man. La primera vez que meo sin rezar el rosario. Gracias, amigo

PHILIP	I lost my stutter, I can’t thank you enough. I’d like to show it off by sharing with you all, loud and clear, that Mary and I are engaged.

FATHER MALLOY	Ok, settle down. Alec, you are part of this community and we cherish your stay here regardless of your decision.

ALEC	Thank you...

FATHER MALLOY	Girls...

LAURA	This is from all of us.
 
PAULA	Sorry we got you in trouble.

FATHER MALLOY	It's a little late, but happy birthday.

CROWD	Happy birthday Alec!

ALEC	Thank you... thank you.

WILLIAM	Mr. Bailey?

ALEC	Yeah!!

WILLIAM	We came because our daughter is very sick.

ALEC	I cleared all this up yesterday, in meeting.

LINDA	We’re not from here. We’ve driven from far away to see you.

ALEC	I can’t help your daughter.

LINDA	She has cancer. Doctors say there’s no cure.

ALEC	I’m sorry that your daughter is so sick.

WILLIAM	Please, will you just come out and take a look.

ALEC	I’m going to ask you politely to please leave my property. I’ve been harassed enough as it is.

LINDA	It’s been a seven hour drive. She’s waiting outside.

ALEC	Please, please, just leave.

WILLIAM	Abigail, come on sweetheart. We gotta go.

MARY	It wasn’t the perfume, it wasn't my great cooking, it was jealousy that woke the idiot.

ALEC	Well, congratulations.

MARY	I love him so damn much, I miss his stutter.

ABIGAIL	I’m going to the bathroom. Hi. I’m Abigail. You talked to my parents.

ALEC	I can’t help you.

ABIGAIL	Of course you can’t, I’m dying. Do you need that piece of bacon? I used to love eggs and hate bacon. Now after being zapped to bits by all the crap they’ve put in me, I hate eggs and love bacon. Go figure.

ALEC	I’m sorry you’re so sick.

ABIGAIL	Yep. Sucks. Oh, don’t worry, it’s not contagious. Un asco

ALEC	Look Abigail, I’m not a healer.

ABIGAIL	Healers don’t exist, Alec. But this is what we’re going to do. You and me. We’re going to hang out for the weekend. That’s how long we’re here in Lunenburg. Look. My parents drove me here, seven hours. I didn’t want to come. You know why I said yes? Because they really believe you have a shot at curing me.

ALEC	Abigail, I...

ABIGAIL	Don’t call me by my name if you’re going to patronise me! Listen because they have just realised that I’m talking to you. My parents have gone through so much shit because of me. Three hospitals, four years, living out of a suitcase. So, this is my gift to them.

ALEC	I can’t...
 
ABIGAIL	Yes you can. Because you don’t have to do anything. I’m not this nasty all the time. It’s two days. Then I’m gone. And when I die, they won’t complain.

LINDA	Darling, don’t bother this man...
 
ABIGAIL	Guess what? Alec’s reconsidered. He will try to cure me. sabéis que?

PARENTS	Oh, my God! 

LINDA	Thank you, thank you.

ABIGAIL	Now mom, dad, Alec can’t promise this is going to work.

WILLIAM	We don't.... ! It's okay...por supuesto

ABIGAIL	So, me and him, we’re going spend most of the weekend together. That’s how it works. Right Alec?

ALEC	Yeah! That’s how it works.


ABIGAIL	So, where are we going to go?

ALEC	To work. I work for a vet.

ABIGAIL	Cool! I love animals. 

ALEC	Yeah?!

ABIGAIL	Yeah, doctors never allowed me to get a dog. Now I’m allowed but I wouldn’t do that to him.	 If you feel sorry for me I will kick you where it hurts.
 
ALEC	What? It’s not mine.

ABIGAIL	Uh huh. 

ALEC	Just get in. Cecilia, this is Abigail. We’re going to hang out together for the weekend.

CECILIA	Nice to meet you, Abigail.

ABIGAIL	Hi. Sorry for just showing up like this. Alec will explain but basically my parents think he’s a shot of curing me, so we’re faking it.

ALEC	I thought she could help up around the farm. I wanted to be a vet too. 

CECILIA	Awesome!

ABIGAIL	Is that a Border Collie?

CECILIA	Yeah, his name is Batman

ABIGAIL	I love them!

ALEC	I'm sorry. I shouldn't.... She begged me.

CECILIA	Of course, it's fine.

ALEC	She said it was some kind of gift to her parents so they don’t lose hope.

CECILIA	She seems nice.

ALEC	She's got cancer, though. She isn't going to make it. She is feisty Tiene cancer. No va a superarlo. Pero Tiene mucha garra.

CECILIA	So, when were you first diagnosed?

ABIGAIL	Third of April, four years ago.

CECILIA	You must have been in shock.

ABIGAIL	Not really, I mean, I was lucky because my doctor at the time was very cool. He refused to call it cancer, he said there were too many bad connotations to that word. My diagnosis was “a bad case of marshmallow” So you two have a thing going?

CECILIA AND ALEC	No.

ABIGAIL	Please.

CECILIA 	No, really we don’t, we’re just friends.

ABIGAIL	That’s not what Batman told me.

CECILIA	Are you okay?

ABIGAIL	No, I have a terminal marshmallow.

ALEC	How about I take you back?

ABIGAIL	That’ll be good. Need my dose of oxygen.

CECILIA	All right, I’ll be seeing you both tomorrow?
 
ABIGAIL	Thanks. Love it here.

ALEC 	Follow me! What?

ABIGAIL	You like her, don’t you? She’s beautiful.

ALEC	Yes she is. But, it’s not possible.

ABIGAIL	Why? Because you work for her?

ALEC	Do you keep a secret? Cecilia likes women.

ABIGAIL	Oh bullcrap from Mars! No, she doesn’t! Y en

ALEC	She does.
 
ABIGAIL	Look, I know lesbians and Cecilia is not one.

ALEC	So you’re an expert, aren't you?

ABIGAIL	My sister is a lesbian and yes I am.

ALEC	You have a sister?

ABIGAIL	Yes, she’s 25 and she’s mega lesbian which makes me an expert. She’s lying. Why she’s lying to you?... is a WHOLE other matter.

ALEC	Wait, wait. What do you mean?

ABIGAIL	Just get in!	

ALEC	Charlie, Charlie !!!  Open the door !!! Open the door, Charlie!!! Abigail, open the door !!!  Charlie !!! Charlie, Charlie ! Abre la puerta !! Abre la puerta, Charlie !!! Abigail, abre la puerta !!! Charlie !!! I need to ask you a question.

CECILIA	Are you drunk?

ALEC	This is one question.

CECILIA	Ok

ALEC	Could I have saved her? Abigail, could I have cured her?

CECILIA	I don’t know, Alec.

ALEC	Please, don't say that. Could I have cured Charlie?

CECILIA	Charlie?
 
ALEC	Charlie! He is my brother! Charlie!! He died of marshmallow! I can’t watch her die. 

CECILIA	Why don't you come inside?

ALEC	He was the smart one. He was the one who came up with the healer idea. It wasn’t just one stupid thing. He was going to franchise, we had 20 stores ready...

CECILIA	I’m so sorry Alec...

ALEC	When he died, everything died. He was my everything.  Can I get the gift back?

CECILIA	You heard Raymond, it's not possible.

ALEC	I think I am going to be sick

CECILIA	Why don't you come inside?

LINDA	Are you all packed?

ABIGAIL	Yeah, I have everything.

LINDA	You do?

ABIGAIL	Don’t worry I’ll be fine.

LINDA	Sunscreen?

ABIGAIL	Yeap

MAN 	She’ll be all right.

CECILIA	Hi there!
 
LINDA	Where’s Alec?

CECILIA	He asked me to pick up Abigail.

ABIGAIL	It’s fine mom. She’s the vet.

WILLIAM	Okay, we'll see you at 6. Have a good time, sweetheart.

CECILIA	Good? Then, right! Let's go!

MAN	Bye, baby.

CECILIA	So, did you get some good sleep last night?

ABIGAIL	Yes. Alec told me you’re into chicks?

CECILIA	What?
 
ABIGAIL	I promised to not to tell you. I said I didn’t buy it.

CECILIA	Mm, yeah, I kind of told him that so he wouldn’t hit on me. 

ABIGAIL	I knew it. He’s cute.
 
CECILIA	Yeah, he is cute.

ABIGAIL	So why don’t you want him to hit on you?

CECILIA	Well, he’s got quite a reputation. He is a hot head.

ABIGAIL	Oh, yeah?
 
CECILIA	Yeah, his uncle actually warned me. So last night, Alec actually fell asleep at my place.
 
ABIGAIL	All right! Now we’re talking!

CECILIA	No, he was drunk and he fell asleep. Seriously, I’m not kidding. You’ll see for yourself.

ABIGAIL	Okay! I hope heaven is just like this.

CECILIA	Me too.
 
ABIGAIL	What about you, Alec?

ALEC	I’m not sure.

ABIGAIL	That’s one shitty answer.	

ALEC	Well if there is a heaven, then....

ABIGAIL	If?! What do you think happens when you die? Has anybody in your family died?
 
ALEC	All of them.

ABIGAIL	Wow!

ALEC	My twin brother, he had what you had.

ABIGAIL	What’s his name?

ALEC	Charlie.

ABIGAIL	When?

ALEC	Two years ago.

ABIGAIL	Charlie. Well, Charlie must be so pissed off at you

ALEC	Why?

ABIGAIL	Why? For thinking he just went PUF! And ceased to exist! You’re an idiot, Alec Bailey. Is that the reason you lost your smile?

ALEC	Maybe.

ABIGAIL	Come here. I promise when I get to heaven I’ll send you a message.

ALEC	Oh, yeah?!

ABIGAIL	I’ll probably scare the crap out of you. Seguramente del susto te cagas

ALEC	Yeah, that’s for sure.

ABIGAIL	It sucks that the weekend is over. I wish I had told my parents it would take a month for this to work.

ALEC	A month? No thanks.

ABIGAIL	Stop the truck! 

ALEC	What?

ABIGAIL	Alec, stop the truck! I need to get out! Stop the truck! 

CAMILLA	Are you ok?

ABIGAIL	Just stop the truck! I love this song! This was our war song at the hospital. When this song came on, we all danced. Now the three of us are going to dance. Come on! 

ALEC	I don’t dance.
 
ABIGAIL	Are you kidding me? How can you not dance to this! All right, then play the guitar!

ALEC	What?
 
ABIGAIL	Play the air guitar, like this!

ALEC	Are you going to give me another ticket?

ABIGAIL	Hi uncle Tom.
 
TOM	Hi there, sweety. Everything OK here?

ABIGAIL	The best. Genial 

TOM	Can you come here a sec? 

ALEC	Why?	

TOM	Just come here. Just wanted to thank you for this. Her father is my brother. And I haven’t seen him this happy... for, well, a long time.

ALEC	It’s getting cold. No que 

ABIGAIL	Shut up Alec, I’m going to die and not from the weather. Wait. I don’t want to say goodbye in front of my parents. I hate goodbyes, so rule number one, no one gets emotional. Deal?

ALEC & CECILIA	Deal.
 
ABIGAIL	I wrote you guys a poem. Don’t worry, it’s really short. It’s called “Just breathe”. We all at some point stop breathing. What if we lived one breath at a time? We speak as though breathing is easy, because it is innate. Is that a cool word or what? Half the time we don’t even notice our breath. When did breathing become the uncool kid that all the other body parts ignored? Think about the phrase “catch your breath” You have to catch it because you've lost control of it. Alec and Cecilia, find control over your breath and please, live for me like tomorrow is your last day. Cecilia, we made a deal. Thanks Alec. I thought this was going to be good for my parents but it`s been incredible for me also.

ALEC	Well, it was special for me too.

ABIGAIL	Dear Jesus, he showed his feelings! Trust me on this, Alec. Charlie is in a better place and he just wants you to be happy.

ALEC	I’ll take you back...

ABIGAIL	Please! I can see my parents from here. Oh! One more thing… She lied. She is not into chicks. And… I lied, I don’t have a sister. Bye!

ALEC	Hold on a minute, why did you lie?

CECILIA	Your uncle said you were a loose wire and that you would try to get in my pants. You’re pretty sure of yourself, aren’t you? You asked me out three minutes into meeting me.

ALEC	He’s unbelievable! I’m going to have a word to him!

CECILIA	Well you might want to talk to him today since he’s leaving tomorrow. Entonces hazlo

ALEC	He’s still here?

CECILIA	Yeah! He’s at your house, or, his house.

ALEC	I need to talk to him, come on! Raymond!

RAYMOND	I’m down here...There is just two things I have to do, then, I'll be gone.
 
ALEC	I want my gift back.

RAYMOND	What? It’s a bit late for that. Why the sudden change of heart?

ALEC	It doesn’t matter why! I made a mistake, now, I want it back

RAYMOND	Alec, I made it very clear.

ALEC	I know what you said about my birthday and midnight but there’s got to be some other way.

RAYMOND	I don’t make the rules.

ALEC	Who does? Who do I have to convince?

RAYMOND	Well Alec, that will be the one you don’t believe in. I’m just an ant on this planet.

ALEC	There’s got to be some kind of clause, some kind of time span or something!

RAYMOND	I'm afraid not.
 
CECILIA	There isn’t, Alec.

ALEC	I was freaking out! I didn't know what I was doing. I had sheep following me!

RAYMOND	You made your choice.
 
ALEC	A choice? How was I supposed to suddenly just accept I had some weird super powers?  I didn’t have any time to understand and to reflect! And now I know I can help, so I want it back!

RAYMOND	Too late...
 
ALEC	You told me I was the healer! Where’s my frame?

RAYMOND	I took it down. We didn't need it anymore.

ALEC	You two played me like a puppet. I should have known about this from the start.

CECILIA	That’s not the way that it works....

ALEC	Oh bullshit with how it works! Not how it works! A little honesty and maybe I would have made the right choice.

CECILIA	Wait...

ALEC	Don’t touch me. You could have stopped this. Maybe I could have saved Abigail 

RAYMOND	It’s no longer up to us anymore. Better let him be.

ALEC	Father Malloy!!! Hello! Father Malloy!!!

FATHER MALLOY	Alec? What are you doing? It’s closed at this hour.

ALEC	Well open it! I need to go in there.	

FATHER MALLOY	What’s going on?

ALEC	How do I talk to him?

FATHER MALLOY	Who?
 
ALEC	Him, him, your boss, him.

FATHER MALLOY	God?

ALEC	Yes!

FATHER MALLOY	You just talk, he listens.

ALEC	Can you just do it for me?

FATHER MALLOY	No. I can't do that.

ALEC	Look, you owe me!

FATHER MALLOY	You are right!  I do. But this, you gotta do it alone. Just close the door when you're done. 

ALEC	Thank you. This is ridiculous. Actually, do you know what? What kind of a thing are you? I mean, if you were good like you say you are and why do you let young people get sick and die? Why don't you start answering me that? I mean, Abigail? Are you serious? Are you that perverse! She is 14 years old ! Now you give me back my gift! I swear if you let Abigail die, I´ll curse the day you ever existed. Charlie, if you are up there, punch this idiot in the face for me. I want it back! Devuélveme mi don This baby is old, Josh. Did a bit of a number on it. 

JOSH	I know. My wife had me convinced to buy another. How much is it? 
 
ALEC	No, please, don’t worry.

JOSH	Beers on me
 
CECILIA	Hey! How are you?

ALEC	Yeah! I’m good. Bien, estoy bien.
 
CECILIA	I bought you a gift. They're “forget me not”s. I figured that they could be a symbol of our new friendship or something and now it feels really cheese to have bought them. I’m really sorry about how it all played out.

ALEC	There was no need to lie all the time.

CECILIA	Your uncle asked me to.

ALEC	Oh yeah? So you're a lesbian?

CECILIA	About Abigail...
 
ALEC	Look please, I blamed you for Abigail and I am sorry. I’m an idiot, I would have always made the wrong choice.

CECILIA	Alec, she wrote us a letter.

ALEC	What?

CECILIA	It’s one of the reasons that I got the courage to come and see you today.

ALEC	What does it say?

CECILIA	I don't know, I wanted to read it with you.

ALEC	Where is your phone? 506...

ABIGAIL	Yes? 
 
ALEC	Abigail...It’s Alec and Cecilia.

CECILIA	Hi!

ABIGAIL	What took you guys so damn long?! You were supposed to call me! Por qué habéis tardado tanto

CECILIA	I'm so sorry! We just opened your letter.

ABIGAIL	So, how are you both?

CECILIA	Fine...
 
ALEC	Yeah, we’re fine. How are you?

ABIGAIL	I am good. So, I have some news guys.

ALEC	All right!

CECILIA	Okay

ABIGAIL	Well, turns out about a year ago I got put on palliative care. Bottom line, it’s like a death sentence because the chemotherapy was no longer working.	

ALEC	Right!

ABIGAIL	But…

CECILIA	But what?

ABIGAIL	When I got back I bumped into the marshmallow doctor I told you about? He was surprised I looked so healthy so he wanted to ran a few tests. You won’t believe this, some kind of weird remission.
	

CECILIA	What does that mean?

ALEC	What is “some kind of weird remission”?	

ABIGAIL	I know, I didn’t understand it either. Well, A) Somehow the cancer is going away B) They’re going to give some treatment to	get rid of what’s still there. And C) I’m not going to die and I’ll be there for Christmas!	

ALEC	What? 

CECILIA	Oh my God!
 
ABIGAIL	Guys, I’m still on the phone here!	

CECILIA	Sorry! Sorry!

ABIGAIL	Hey Alec?

ALEC	Yeah?	

ABIGAIL	You should tell everyone you cured me. Take the credit. My parents are convinced it was you. And get ready, because they’re sending over three baskets of fruit. Spoiler alert: Don’t touch the apples, they suck.

ALEC	Alright!

ABIGAIL	Listen I’ve got to go. Call me!	

CECILIA	Yes, and say hi to your sister for us.

ABIGAIL	Cecilia, if you haven’t kissed this idiot by now, just hurry up and do it. Love you guys!	
CECILIA	Bye...

ALEC	It's just unbelievable...	

CECILIA	Stop! Stop! Stop!

ALEC	Why?

CECILIA	I landed on this. Me clavaba esto en la espalda Where? What are you…?

ALEC	I’m just going to get some water. Oh God! You scared the crap out of me! What are you doing here?

RAYMOND	It’s my house, I had something to do in the basement.

ALEC	Can I ask you a question? When your father found out that he was a healer, did he accept the gift immediately?
 
RAYMOND	No, no, he didn't. He didn’t want the gift. Then something happened to make him change his mind.
	
ALEC	What happened?	

RAYMOND	Frankly Alec, that is now none of your business.

ALEC	She’s not going to die, you know. Abigail, the little girl. She is in remission.

RAYMOND	Really? That is good news. Bye, Alec.

ALEC	Bye.

RAYMOND	Alec? Ever noticed anything odd about yourself?

ALEC	Batman?

ALEC 	Oh... my God...

CECILIA	!
